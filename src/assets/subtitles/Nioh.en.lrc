[ve:60.16.100]

[01:04.36]What's going on, all you fucking jokers?
[01:10.89]The riot is over, yeah.
[01:12.09]The riot gets to heaven.
[01:14.15]At least for now.
[01:14.69]We can riot some other time.
[01:18.27]But, well, this is kind of fucking loud.
[01:23.45]Oh, I'm just looking on the OBS thing.
[01:24.77]Oh, this game has an autosave feature.
[01:26.07]Yeah, whatever.
[01:28.74]It's been 17 years?
[01:29.72]It has not been 17 years.
[01:31.10]It's been like three days.
[01:34.07]I wonder if this is going to play through these speakers.
[01:36.65]Yeah, you'll be eating spaghetti.
[01:38.47]Hey, we can actually hear it.
[01:48.68]Oh, I'm going to move that.
[01:50.20]Thank you, Zat.
[01:50.58]It was delicious for the 12 months.
[01:52.12]Thank you for... You guys can hear that twice, by the way.
[01:55.04]2,885 minutes late.
[01:55.52]No, that would be like 17 days.
[01:56.20]I'm so glad you guys can hear this fucking twice.
[01:57.44]Hold on, I gotta move that.
[01:58.70]That's a little bit on the big side for me.
[01:59.58]Yeah.
[02:20.29]Hey, thanks to Scrundle Dengus and Cyrus Dexter.
[02:23.51]And Gambit Balls.
[02:25.36]Thanks to all of you!
[02:26.30]It's coming soon.
[02:37.25]Re-resubscribe or whatever it is.
[02:42.17]Thank you.
[02:42.57]I dare on me.
[02:44.32]Thanks, guys.
[02:44.80]Hey, I'm gonna play Nioh.
[02:46.36]I heard this game's hard.
[02:47.08]It's like Dark Souls.
[02:47.76]And you know I love those games.
[02:48.78]And why the fuck not, you know?
[02:51.76]So... I don't want to waste much time.
[02:54.92]Because... I just got in the game setting.
[02:57.26]I'm, like, streaming from my couch, by the way, guys.
[03:01.07]Like... Loud.
[03:03.91]What's loud?
[03:05.29]Loud game, quiet streamer.
[03:06.81]Well, hold on.
[03:07.21]I can fix that.
[03:10.23]I can fix that.
[03:10.95]Take a look.
[03:14.67]How's that sound?
[03:19.65]Every time I start the stream, I just get these resubs that I just can't keep up with because I fucking suck at life.
[03:25.60]I'm going to do a new game.
[03:27.20]There's going to be a cutscene here.
[03:28.88]I'm going to get a drink because I'm probably going to have to drink to play this game.
[03:33.50]You want to make me one?
[03:35.50]Just get me some straight whiskey.
[03:41.78]Clown cam or riot?
[03:43.08]No.
[03:45.18]I'm going to make a new character.
[03:45.98]I just jumped because I'm... Oh, God.
[03:48.54]Knocking shit over already.
[03:49.58]Couch cam?
[03:50.46]That would be a fucking terror.
[03:52.22]You know what?
[03:52.50]Whatever.
[03:52.76]Let's try it.
[03:53.68]Couch cam.
[03:54.08]I'm just going to turn it on for two seconds.
[03:55.64]No, I can't.
[03:56.04]Never mind.
[03:56.92]I lied.
[03:57.20]Alright.
[03:58.62]Here comes opening cutscene.
[03:59.53]Just hang out.
[04:02.13]Yeah.
[04:05.65]Kim's quiet.
[04:06.21]That's because she's on the other side of the mic.
[04:09.91]I might be able to turn it up a little bit.
[04:11.78]Ow.
[04:15.30]Give me Three Fingers.
[04:18.14]Uh, yeah.
[04:24.56]Three of my fingers or three of Donald Trump's?
[04:30.00]Three Trump fingers.
[04:31.36]Okay, so here you go.
[04:32.94]I'm like ruining.
[04:33.76]I'm going to shut up.
[04:34.44]I'll be back.
[04:34.98]Watch the cutscene.
[04:35.72]Philosopher's stone.
[04:45.01]The Queen of England remains locked in combat.
[04:50.22]With what?
[04:55.13]With Spain.
[04:57.57]The country where the sun never sets.
[05:01.08]I haven't been paying attention to a fucking goddamn thing.
[05:08.24]What happened?
[05:08.78]No, but what's more important is there's like- there's a fucking- there's an aggro crag on the screen.
[05:33.28]The Philosopher's Stone.
[05:34.34]Is this Fullmetal Alchemist?
[05:35.20]That is Fullmetal Alchemist.
[05:36.22]You know what?
[05:36.84]It looks like what a period stone would be.
[05:39.44]It looks cool.
[05:41.48]Wait, what?
[05:43.27]Wait, what the hell did you just say?
[05:46.57]What did you just say?
[05:48.57]It looks like what a crystallized period blood would be.
[05:53.40]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stream, where we, uh, you know, we have, we have, uh, you know, I guess I'll be the straight man tonight.
[05:59.97]And I will be the other... You'll, you'll be la- I'll be the other straight man.
[06:03.83]Oh my fucking god, we haven't even started, and we haven't even had any drinks, and you're already talking about, like... What the fuck?
[06:11.94]Alright, Tower of Bliss is, like, every Dark Souls game.
[06:14.00]Who cares?
[06:14.58]You're gonna break out of a fucking prison, right?
[06:24.32]No, I'm good.
[06:25.62]I had that entire tray of like... Shush!
[06:28.20]Shush!
[06:28.46]Shush!
[06:57.81]Alright, so before we go... I guess I have a little Legend of Zelda fairy.
[07:12.59]But, uh... Thank you for the bits.
[07:14.97]Somebody gave 1,500.
[07:15.85]Let's see who it was.
[07:18.69]Actually, Jay Swish gave 1,000.
[07:20.53]When Dad finally comes home, PogChamp.
[07:23.61]Apparently, yeah.
[07:24.00]It makes a lot of people uncomfortable.
[07:25.04]Welcome to the stream.
[07:25.64]Alright, this is Neil.
[07:26.70]Hopefully this is synced up.
[07:42.40]But like I said, like any Dark Souls game, you break out of a fucking prison.
[07:46.44]Oh no, can I open the door?
[07:47.57]Shit, it just needs to be locked.
[07:49.57]But I'm just gonna follow my Legend of Zelda.
[07:51.93]What's that fairy's name?
[07:54.39]Um, Navi?
[07:55.33]Janet?
[07:56.43]Navi.
[07:56.95]Yeah, Navi.
[07:58.50]What did I say?
[07:59.56]Janet.
[08:00.02]Oh, that was wrong.
[08:00.64]Okay.
[08:02.36]I obviously have to do this.
[08:06.74]And like everything, I guess this is just like... Who made this game?
[08:11.59]Koei?
[08:12.91]Something like that?
[08:16.79]Thank you Fafnir for the 1500.
[08:17.93]Alright, so I guess... Do I have to die somewhere here?
[08:24.72]I'm going to assume you just walk out and die.
[08:26.70]Like every game like this.
[08:28.44]Like every game like this.
[08:29.18]Like every game like this.
[08:30.44]Should I just kick this guy's ass?
[08:35.64]Oh, there we go.
[08:38.18]Fourteen months, thanks a lot dude.
[08:42.66]I'm assuming, yeah, holy shit, that hurts a lot.
[08:44.95]Okay.
[08:47.39]So there's a dodge roll.
[08:48.79]Yeah.
[08:49.43]Do I kill this guy and take it from him?
[08:53.37]I'm sure we'll find out, right?
[08:56.89]He's just blocking me?
[09:08.82]Am I supposed to fight this guy?
[09:10.48]Am I doing this right?
[09:12.92]What?
[09:13.26]I feel like I'm not supposed to fight this guy right now, but I am.
[09:16.40]He's out of stamina.
[09:17.84]How do I stomp him?
[09:19.28]That's how you stomp him.
[09:20.20]Got it.
[09:20.42]Okay.
[09:23.13]Well, there's the sword.
[09:23.79]Oh, take.
[09:26.91]And a dungeon key.
[09:27.59]Alright, how do I put that shit on?
[09:30.09]Um... Not like that.
[09:34.79]Not like that either.
[09:36.78]Taunt?
[09:37.36]Oh my god, you can taunt people in this game?
[09:39.34]That's so funny.
[09:40.02]Yeah, you can taunt in, like, uh... Hey, you know, pretty much all games like that.
[09:45.05]You can do, like, taunting.
[09:46.59]Really?
[09:46.93]I'm gonna run with that.
[09:49.25]I've never played, like, Dark Souls or anything like that, so... They're very good games.
[09:53.55]Alright, well, I have these keys.
[09:54.39]Might as well see what the hell's even in here.
[09:59.64]Guard?
[10:00.18]It's L1.
[10:00.60]Okay.
[10:01.82]Dodge?
[10:02.34]Man, I figured that out.
[10:04.90]Where's the dead body that teaches me how to equip items?
[10:10.96]Is he just past the dead body?
[10:12.40]Like, right behind you?
[10:14.28]From earlier?
[10:15.42]Yeah.
[10:17.81]But, how?
[10:20.19]Kimmy's a casual.
[10:22.31]No Dark Souls.
[10:25.61]I like thriller games, and I am more of a retro gamer.
[10:29.05]So, I don't really play games like this.
[10:33.18]Oh, did you hear that, guys?
[10:35.54]What do we do?
[10:38.50]Tower of Guard boots?
[10:40.08]There's like actual items in this game, too.
[10:41.92]Okay, status menu.
[10:43.14]You can equip items in the status menu.
[10:46.67]Oh, okay.
[10:48.75]Can I just swipe down?
[10:49.99]Does the game actually utilize the touchpad?
[10:54.07]It really is.
[10:55.61]Just two bastard swords, I guess.
[11:00.04]Can I have two?
[11:05.75]Good choice.
[11:06.23]I guess you can only have one.
[11:11.69]More casual than me?
[11:12.57]Impossible.
[11:14.31]I like how you run with these swords, though.
[11:15.69]This is cool.
[11:23.32]I'm just trying to get a feel for how the stamina bar works.
[11:25.92]Anything else in this room that I missed?
[11:30.33]Why don't you crack open that box and see if you can?
[11:33.51]Can I open the box?
[11:34.31]I think there was already... Oh, it's already open?
[11:36.12]Yeah, it was already sitting there.
[11:38.40]What a basic gamer.
[11:39.52]Is there a sprint?
[11:43.35]I can't be any louder because I'm not close to the mic.
[11:45.61]So I'm sitting right next to you, Jeremy, so I can listen to the game.
[11:49.67]We're doing this really shit setup.
[11:52.14]It's a really, really ghetto setup.
[11:55.10]We're really close.
[11:56.70]Too close for comfort.
[11:59.04]She's too close to me.
[12:01.38]Medicine 1, item shortcut.
[12:04.26]Chain shortcut R2.
[12:05.03]Okay, so I'm assuming I can put that shit up there.
[12:11.99]Items, medicine.
[12:13.73]Set a shortcut.
[12:15.79]I'm going to go with down.
[12:18.13]Right?
[12:18.77]That makes sense, I think.
[12:20.75]To put your weapon on the down cursor?
[12:23.42]Jeremy, we know his name now?
[12:26.34]Pusher.
[12:27.92]I mean, yeah, of course you guys knew my name.
[12:29.80]You guys knew my name like fucking four years ago.
[12:35.22]Thanks for all these subs, by the way.
[12:36.38]It's just hard to pay attention because we're on like the couch.
[12:39.30]Lucky seven out.
[12:40.18]Just for your sub.
[12:41.04]Thank you.
[12:41.91]Thanks, dude.
[12:45.31]It's true.
[12:45.79]It's true.
[12:46.23]I'm on a date.
[12:47.71]Yeah.
[12:48.15]Oh, holy mackerel.
[12:48.85]100 bits.
[12:49.03]Kim, tell Jeremiah I've spent $1.40 to say he's 10 days late and he better add this to my paycheck.
[13:04.12]What?
[13:04.44]Um, what?
[13:05.07]What are you talking about?
[13:05.67]I don't even know what that means.
[13:07.11]Alright, well, don't worry.
[13:07.75]Just watch me, watch me.
[13:08.51]Yeah, you wanna watch me.
[13:09.49]I'm gonna really impress you right now, Kim.
[13:10.97]You ready for this?
[13:11.75]Ready to get impressed?
[13:12.81]I'm not impressed.
[13:15.51]Watch this one.
[13:17.72]Nah, that was super impressive.
[13:21.76]Come on, guys.
[13:22.18]I gotta, like, impress her.
[13:23.24]Okay.
[13:25.94]How was that?
[13:27.74]I'm impressed.
[13:29.18]Yeah, just watch her, like, get to her boss.
[13:30.43]Oh, no.
[13:37.36]It's like if you do a boss fight and you leave because you're embarrassed for me.
[13:42.89]So, I heard Star was throwing his ass to you during the boss fight.
[13:46.87]I assume that you will just die.
[13:49.29]I hope not.
[13:51.25]Yeah, Star was talking about how this game's hard.
[13:54.57]Where's my, like, soul counter?
[13:57.44]Whoa!
[13:58.14]Holy fuck, you just came out of nowhere.
[14:00.66]Welcome to Dark Souls.
[14:01.76]That was fucking rude.
[14:03.06]Yo, welcome to Dark Souls.
[14:04.90]Where's the swear thing?
[14:07.16]I'm gonna need one.
[14:09.42]They do that in these games.
[14:10.94]Okay, that guy has a big, like, lance.
[14:13.33]Wait, so they just, like, come out of nowhere in these games?
[14:15.47]Yeah, they, like, tactically hide the money.
[14:17.07]This actually is pretty fun, though.
[14:19.43]From so far, it's very fluid.
[14:21.19]Very good.
[14:23.03]Dude, my spaghetti is so cold.
[14:25.89]Throw it in there for, like, another 30 seconds?
[14:27.27]No, because it overcooks the... The snossage?
[14:30.29]The snossage.
[14:32.95]Medicine.
[14:34.07]Medicine.
[14:34.53]Now, is there, like, an Estus Flask?
[14:38.33]Or is it just medicine?
[14:39.11]Is it like Bloodborne where you have to, like, compile?
[14:41.03]Congratulations to Kim for becoming the fixation of your entire stream.
[14:44.59]Remember, if things go south, just play Mario Maker.
[14:47.81]Thank you for subscribing for three months, Logoman441.
[14:51.81]Just remember, the solution is play Mario Maker.
[14:55.87]That game makes me more angry than anything.
[14:57.59]Mario Maker?
[14:58.23]Yeah.
[14:58.77]Is it that game with all the other people, like, make those games that you have to... Oh, I hate that.
[15:03.29]I hated that.
[15:04.45]What about the golden egg?
[15:06.40]So you pray the golden egg, and what does it do?
[15:10.79]That, apparently, that's what it does.
[15:12.33]Huh.
[15:12.77]Is this, like, a checkpoint or a bonfire or something?
[15:16.47]I have to assume it's a checkpoint.
[15:17.53]It must be, like, a save point.
[15:19.50]Yeah, probably.
[15:20.60]Geralt?
[15:21.12]What did Geralt say?
[15:23.24]Dad and Mom finally come home.
[15:26.12]Jswish, thanks for the 520.
[15:27.17]Thank you also to Andrew251 for the 1000.

[15:35.77]She already knows.
[15:36.45]Incompetent of how much of a doofus you are?
[15:38.93]She already knows.
[15:39.53]She's known that I was a goofy doof ball.
[15:45.29]Cheers 100 daddy from tub Tucker listen.

[16:25.81]Oh, what is it?
[16:26.71]Oh, whoa, whoa!

[16:27.98]I'm dead already.
[16:28.42]I lose.
[16:28.68]Dude, focus.
[16:33.70]Focus on the game.
[16:35.64]I can't focus when you say things like that on the stream.
[16:39.90]What am I supposed to do?
[16:40.92]Alright, well, that's... I'm dead.
[16:43.67]Wait, can I try?
[16:47.94]You want to try this?
[16:48.86]Yeah.
[16:50.41]I'll give you... I'll give you... Yeah, so this is just like a bonfire.
[16:56.29]Alright.
[16:57.41]Note to self.
[16:58.11]Don't aggro the whole room.
[17:00.53]Sorry.
[17:04.03]I did not expect there to be like four people in here.
[17:14.03]I do like this weapon.
[17:17.71]boots.
[17:18.27]Alright, so do I get my shit back?
[17:20.57]My, like, soul back?
[17:21.37]Permadeath no rewinds?
[17:22.31]That's not good.
[17:24.22]Oh, is it like one of those games where you, like, like that game Bloodborne that you were playing, where if you, like, lose all your shit, like, you just lose all your shit?
[17:31.68]Yeah.
[17:31.84]Oh, that sucks.
[17:33.02]But, I don't know.
[17:34.32]I'm not sure how this game's mechanics work.
[17:38.25]It's probably similar.
[17:39.85]They are dropping these yellow souls.
[17:42.95]Though I don't know.
[17:43.51]I'm not sure if...
[17:48.92]It's a clone, so... Well, I didn't pay attention to the cutscene.
[17:53.44]Is this going to be a mimic?
[17:55.06]Is it a mix in this game?
[17:55.82]This is a new battle axe.
[18:04.89]Ooh.
[18:07.45]R1 plus... Ah, okay.
[18:09.67]So that's what hand it's in.
[18:10.95]Alright, let's put the battle axe on.
[18:12.09]Let's just see how it is.
[18:20.03]These are both six.
[18:23.66]These are legs, just put them on.
[18:25.48]Look at that hat.
[18:28.92]It's a pretty nice hat.
[18:31.24]I actually have a hat like that at home.
[18:35.09]You got an outfit like this back at the house?
[18:37.13]Um, not like that specifically.
[18:40.03]Oh, you like that?
[18:40.79]That's pretty sick.
[18:42.61]Really sick.
[18:43.03]Ooh.
[18:44.54]Okay.
[18:45.70]Shortcut?
[18:46.22]What, like, what the fuck is this?
[18:48.18]Stone.
[18:49.74]Throwing it at enemies, alright.
[18:52.14]Whatever.
[18:52.46]That's, like, very barbaric.
[18:55.41]Alright, let's see how this thing is.
[18:57.85]Ooh.
[19:04.99]I kinda like this shit.
[19:06.61]Alright, let's, uh, let's keep going.
[19:09.98]Now, is there, like, fat rolling in this game?
[19:11.70]Is there weight?
[19:13.11]I don't know.
[19:13.67]I'm just sitting here asking questions over and over again when I should just be playing.
[19:18.01]So, just play, Jeremy.
[19:19.21]Just play.
[19:19.55]Please don't have Kim discuss childbirth in disgusting detail.
[19:22.77]I have no idea what childbirth is like.
[19:25.53]No, no, no, no.
[19:26.79]They caught you.
[19:27.55]They just caught you.
[19:28.61]They caught you.
[19:30.84]Them saying that is trying to get you to say the things you're trying not to say.
[19:33.06]They're trying to get you to say.
[19:34.80]Oh.
[19:36.46]Hey, please don't have Kim talk about childbirth.
[19:39.89]Oh, well, think about childbirth.
[19:41.63]Well, I don't know anything about childbirth.
[19:44.75]So, there you go.
[19:46.97]So, did they respawn?
[19:48.41]Thank you, Lucas, for resubscribing for five months.
[19:51.47]Thanks, dude.
[19:53.26]There it is.
[19:53.68]Alright, so that does spawn people again, but this door needs to be opened from the other side.
[19:57.44]And somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[20:00.50]That's the $5,000, right?
[20:01.18]Yeah.
[20:02.16]Great Lord Walden gave $5,050.
[20:04.32]Presto, Majesto, jermaMoon.
[20:06.62]Well, thanks a lot, dude.
[20:07.98]Thank you for the $50.
[20:08.62]That's incredibly generous of you.
[20:12.12]And all the other people that are subbing and resubbing and shit.
[20:16.70]Thank you.
[20:17.96]Thank you.
[20:18.34]The Stork.
[20:19.50]The Stork.
[20:20.22]This is... We are a PG stream.
[20:25.38]Well, you called the Stork.
[20:27.96]The answer is...
[20:29.68]Yeah, what do you want?
[20:31.82]And you ask nicely, yeah, you know, me and my significant other were thinking about having a child.
[20:36.72]Yes, and we're gonna call this one.
[20:41.82]And yes, I do have a Twitch channel.
[20:43.58]You guys can do whatever you want, but I don't really stream myself, so.
[20:50.64]I literally just made a Twitch to subscribe to Jeremy's channel.
[20:55.38]But it is twitch.tv.com.
[21:00.25]There it is.
[21:00.53]Wait, what?
[21:00.79]This is a family-friendly string.
[21:01.71]First boss?
[21:02.19]I think this might be the first boss.
[21:03.59]This used to be a wholesome, childish string.
[21:19.63]The day when England reigns supreme is near.
[21:26.80]What about a sellout?
[21:28.72]I'm not a sellout.
[21:29.90]No, I think they're telling me that I'm a sellout.
[21:32.58]You've changed.
[21:33.24]Oh, shit.
[21:33.88]Stars here.
[21:34.26]Everybody run.
[21:36.63]Hi.
[21:37.57]Hi, Stephen.
[21:39.33]Star's here.
[21:40.93]Everybody fucking run for your life.
[21:43.33]This has been going on for a long time.
[21:45.35]Stephen didn't even pick up the phone for you.
[21:49.79]No, he didn't.
[21:51.37]I pick up the phone for you, Jeremy, sometimes.
[21:53.97]Yeah.
[21:55.09]When you feel like it.
[21:56.49]Oh, watch out.
[21:56.89]We've got a fucking demon.
[22:04.28]Im-Im-Imersion ruined.
[22:07.00]Oh, you said his real name.
[22:08.42]He's never told anybody his real name.
[22:10.64]People thought he was George.
[22:11.44]He put his real name on his Overwatch pass on Twitter.
[22:14.45]Dude, people thought his name was... People thought his name was George.
[22:19.65]George Davidson.
[22:21.07]Am I going the right way?
[22:29.18]Version ruined.
[22:31.94]I'm just gonna go this way.
[22:37.06]The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[22:39.34]Who's the Holy Spirit?
[22:40.92]Me.
[22:42.12]No, it must be Otto.
[22:43.42]No.
[22:45.11]He's, like, right in between us, too.
[22:48.79]I thought his name was Keith.
[22:49.85]No, it's George.
[22:50.73]Everyone, no one knows his real name is George.
[22:53.59]His four sons are named George.
[22:55.43]Alright.
[22:57.86]We don't need to talk about this.
[22:58.95]This ain't a star stream.
[23:00.01]This is a Jeremy stream.
[23:01.49]We can talk about how fucking sick I am at this game.
[23:09.37]I think this is the shortcut.
[23:11.12]Cool.
[23:13.74]That's a fucking stupid hat.
[23:17.28]Well, there's the shortcut.
[23:18.78]I guess I'm just going to keep going that way.
[23:20.02]Might as well do that.
[23:25.43]One year with you, my man?
[23:27.17]We should catch up on old times, you know.
[23:28.85]Oh, JK, you don't care.
[23:31.15]Star for 12 months.
[23:32.55]Thanks, Star.
[23:34.37]Wow.
[23:35.73]Wow, what a guy, guys.
[23:37.69]Amanda?
[23:38.09]Isn't that his wife's name?
[23:40.98]I thought that's what his wife's name was.
[23:43.26]It's Gretchen.
[23:45.48]Is it really Gretchen?
[23:47.80]Yeah.
[23:51.20]That's so sad.
[23:52.80]Okay.
[23:55.48]Alright, well I found the shortcut.
[23:57.60]Can I get a DNA sample for what?
[23:59.44]What do you need it for?
[24:00.88]You explain why you need it.
[24:03.76]Is it for a school project?
[24:05.26]What, you need something like saliva or something?
[24:08.12]Oh, is it Ashley?
[24:09.64]Oh, it's Ashley.
[24:14.14]Who's Amanda then?
[24:15.22]Where did I get that name from?
[24:19.24]I don't know.
[24:19.86]You'll have to meet them.
[24:21.06]And they'll be like... Who the hell is this person?
[24:25.70]I'll probably be like that too in the back of my mind as I fade into the background and throw myself off into the void and drive your car off the highway.
[24:34.76]Wait, what?
[24:38.04]I just took the first hit of the whole game because you just said you were going to drive my car off the highway.
[24:45.92]This is where this dude was, right?
[24:47.28]I don't know.
[24:53.80]Alright, I was here before.
[24:55.72]I gotta pay attention to this shit.
[24:57.07]Let's see.
[25:01.23]I came from that way.
[25:02.89]Let me look over here.
[25:03.59]There's probably no map in this game.
[25:06.23]Why would there be?
[25:07.33]It's dark, too.
[25:12.18]That was where that guy was.
[25:14.38]Did I go this way?
[25:14.96]I don't think I went this way.
[25:18.94]Nope, I didn't.
[25:19.98]Whatever is over here is over here.
[25:22.71]Guard hat.
[25:28.65]Did I drive a clown car?
[25:29.63]Well, you'd be right.
[25:30.15]What about down here?
[25:31.77]Ooh, shit.
[25:32.45]Okay.
[25:33.21]Oh, god, that hurt.
[25:35.65]I definitely shouldn't have done that.
[25:36.69]This is, like, this is a bad idea.
[25:37.69]I don't even know what the fuck I just did that for.
[25:39.76]I just went all the way down again.
[25:44.42]Why did I do that?
[25:44.94]I was thinking it was gonna be something where I would jump down and there'd be, like, a cutscene.
[25:49.48]But I kept being a fucking idiot.
[25:53.88]Uh, well, we gotta go back up.
[26:06.52]Hey, can I tell you that I'm, like, games like this are great, but why do they always have to be in a, like, black and gray dungeon?
[26:14.25]Like, can't somebody start somewhere else?
[26:16.43]Can they, can somebody make a game like a Dark Souls type game where you don't start in a fucking, like, dark dungeon that, like, everything looks the goddamn same?
[26:23.03]Why can't we start, like, fucking in, like, a cartoon rainbow land?
[26:27.78]Why can't that not be a thing?
[26:28.56]No, it's gonna be, like, a dark fucking bunch of hallways and everything's all misty and dungeons.
[26:35.07]You know what I mean?
[26:35.57]Like, fuck that.
[26:36.17]I'm done with that.
[26:40.13]They did.
[26:40.49]I'm just, like, walking in circles right now.
[26:45.76]Should I go down?
[26:46.38]It's for immersion.
[26:54.90]God damn it.
[26:55.72]I don't even know where the fuck I'm going.
[26:58.97]Um... It's over.
[27:04.74]Well, I opened up a... I feel like this is like, where else am I supposed to go?
[27:12.22]Didn't I get a key?
[27:14.02]You already used it.
[27:15.16]I already used it like three times?
[27:16.72]No, you already used it.
[27:17.83]I think you can only use it once, right?
[27:19.67]I don't know.
[27:20.13]Let me look at my inventory and see something.
[27:27.88]new items in the dungeon key but no that's uh my real name is just Kim yeah what's the rabbit down what about uh next yeah because something like I I I I feel like should I go I don't know I'm gonna go down and wrap around I feel like this is the only place I haven't gone
[27:54.15]Right?
[27:54.31]I mean, or is this just leading me back to the dungeons?
[27:57.35]No?
[27:57.63]Okay.
[27:58.88]So, turns out that's where I needed to go.
[28:12.21]How much does the medicine heal, I wonder?
[28:27.25]Oh fuck that was stupid of me Okay, that's it heals a lot actually Who knows um what was that just pick something new up Both the same thing receive firearms damage that's different toughness plus one oh
[28:53.15]Let's put that one on.
[28:54.91]Why not?
[28:56.19]And... 52.
[29:00.08]Oh god, chat, no.
[29:06.30]Don't ask.
[29:07.34]Alright, rule of thumb.
[29:09.31]If you don't know what it means, don't say it out loud.
[29:14.41]No, let's just Google it.
[29:15.97]No, don't Google it.
[29:17.29]Get out of the Google.
[29:33.64]Oh wow.
[29:34.70]So that just like, linked me to like a... What you meant to say was... Man, I really, um... I really love Captain Crunch, is what you meant to say.
[29:48.82]Captain Crunch is what?
[29:50.40]Is a pretty great cereal, right?
[29:52.90]What'd you say?
[29:55.05]I'm never using Google ever again if they ever mention anything like this.
[30:00.58]It's just all about how good frosted plates are when you microwave them.
[30:05.74]Don't microwave frosted plates.
[30:06.96]It's probably terrible.
[30:10.85]What is this?
[30:14.01]Alright, I gotta go down.
[30:14.87]Where the fuck did I lose this much health from?
[30:17.05]What?
[30:19.13]I lost a lot of health there, somehow.
[30:26.08]Not as good as Dr. Pepper.
[30:32.40]Ooh, he, like, faked me out.
[30:36.40]Okay, nothing over here.
[30:40.34]Google microwaved Frosted Flakes.
[30:42.32]Now that, okay, that is safe for a Google.
[30:44.89]If you want to Google that, go for it.
[30:46.51]Do it.
[30:47.19]Google that.
[30:50.50]This stream is sponsored by Captain Crunch Cereal?
[30:52.37]Of course it is.
[30:53.77]Shit, I probably shouldn't say that.
[30:55.73]This stream is not sponsored in any way.
[30:57.93]Please, Nabisco, don't sue me.
[31:00.13]I really hope Nabisco doesn't get me in trouble for saying that.
[31:04.84]I don't think it's Nabisco.
[31:06.48]Twitch is a dangerous place.
[31:07.72]This is your trial by fire.
[31:10.64]Thank you for letting me steal the burn.
[31:15.31]Alright, well I need to like another checkpoint here because I'm scared that I'm gonna have to do this all over again Yeah, I just don't alright What I have not died once oh fuck.
[31:25.79]What did I do?
[31:26.28]What did I do that for?
[31:28.94]Why did I do that now there's two guys with giant armor?
[31:33.68]Whoa oh Fuck these guys have a ton of health.
[31:37.59]What have I done?
[31:39.01]What have I done?
[31:39.45]Now this is the first real test
[31:46.97]I don't even know if there's invincibility frames.
[31:48.64]I have no idea.
[31:49.38]I wonder if, like, there's a different, like, blunt versus, uh, like, maybe I should put the battle axe away and try this sword.
[32:00.64]Just out of curiosity.
[32:02.36]Nope, that doesn't fucking do anything.
[32:05.87]He, like, he blocked it.
[32:06.93]Although I can do this parry move, too.
[32:10.07]Oh, shit!
[32:17.46]Oh, you did die.
[32:18.20]See?
[32:18.42]I told you you suck.
[32:29.33]At least I fucking know where to go.
[32:30.49]God damn it.
[32:31.21]Okay, you just... Are there invincibility frames in this game?
[32:35.71]Like, can I dodge through an attack?
[32:37.03]I don't have any idea.
[32:37.99]I fucking have no clue.
[32:42.33]I'm just gonna try it.
[32:43.25]Let's just see what happens.
[32:46.84]I wanna, like, dodge through his sword.
[32:49.06]I can't even, like, fucking tell.
[32:50.00]I can't even, like, line it up correctly.
[32:51.78]I don't know.
[32:53.09]I'm scared to, like, even know.
[32:55.63]Oh, whatever.
[32:56.69]Fuck, just die.
[33:01.77]No rewinds.
[33:03.71]This is technically not a rewind.
[33:05.04]This is... I died.
[33:11.00]Stream support sucks.
[33:13.12]Stream support?! !
[33:14.84]What are you talking about?
[33:16.83]I'm like really all about kicking people while they're down.
[33:21.45]Yeah, you're supposed to like grab me by the shoulder and be like, oh, you'll get him next time.
[33:26.79]That was such a good attempt.
[33:30.85]Yeah, see?
[33:34.47]What?
[33:35.47]They're even asking, wait, what?
[33:37.41]I'm doing this guy.
[33:38.07]This time, no holds barred.
[33:40.39]I'm just going in hard.
[33:41.21]You know what I'm saying?
[33:45.82]You gotta stop just being a wuss about it and just go in and start swinging fucking wildly.
[33:50.30]No, you can't play how Matt would play.
[33:54.38]Nope.
[33:54.72]Sometimes you have to do a Burgah Boy.
[33:55.96]Sometimes the Burgah Boy technique is the one you gotta fucking use.
[34:02.16]And then sometimes you gotta back away and do a different technique.
[34:07.06]I'm not supposed to be here.
[34:08.50]I've come to the fucking conclusion that I'm not supposed to go to these guys.
[34:12.69]I'm fucking certain of that.
[34:14.11]I'm as certain of that as you could be.
[34:18.80]Fucking god.
[34:19.44]Can you take them?
[34:21.30]No, not with this equipped.
[34:22.40]I might be able to get rid of one of them.
[34:27.59]I told you I was getting one.
[34:30.31]How can he can swing through me?
[34:31.51]Oh my god, this is a disaster.
[34:33.59]There we go.
[34:42.28]Just gotta get used to it.
[34:43.86]Oh, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[34:45.38]He's staggered.
[34:47.14]No, don't!
[34:57.05]I don't want to fucking die, but I don't want to heal So what nobody's so painful to watch you play a game like this before this shit ain't easy Hey, do you know I beat Dark Souls 3 on spring?
[35:16.96]I don't care that you beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[35:19.16]Do you know that I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
[35:20.60]Blind, no Wikipedia, no walkthroughs?
[35:22.48]I don't care.
[35:24.89]I should.
[35:28.89]Get your fail fishes ready?
[35:29.85]What are you talking about fail?
[35:30.63]I just did it.
[35:32.17]I just did it.
[35:34.59]Now let me just go see what the hell is going on there.
[35:39.04]I'm getting the hang of this.
[35:42.42]What is through the... What were they guarding?
[35:44.66]Karl Marx is a great philosopher, too.
[35:48.12]Thank you, Hollywood.
[35:49.66]Is that somebody's name?
[35:51.88]Oh, no, he's talking about Karl Marx.
[35:54.26]Wait, why is he writing about Karl Marx?
[35:58.44]Don't you know his name?
[35:59.58]There's no political talk in this stream.
[36:02.32]Except when we talk about Donald.
[36:04.24]Donald Trump's at tiny hands.
[36:07.41]No, no.
[36:09.45]You never talk politics with your friends.
[36:10.99]You know that?
[36:12.82]What do you mean?
[36:13.90]There's 25,000 friends here, you know?
[36:15.88]You don't talk politics with your friends.
[36:17.70]Oh, we talk politics.
[36:19.02]Communist!
[36:19.75]Communist!
[36:20.41]Oh, no.
[36:23.29]Communist.
[36:26.07]Just because you've read a few papers.
[36:27.91]Alright, this is... I gotta check... Hold on.
[36:30.89]This is... We need to pray here.
[36:32.31]I feel like I should have been able to level up by now.
[36:37.75]Dude, I'm so hungry.
[36:40.69]Go eat something else.
[36:44.13]Anyway, weapon, changing weapons.
[36:47.45]Just examine this.
[36:48.57]25, the 2.5 million.
[36:51.79]2.5 million what?
[36:54.53]This is 2.5 million people watching right now.
[36:56.08]What do you mean?
[36:57.50]Like, let's see.
[36:57.94]See?
[36:58.26]See?
[37:00.14]That seed, 1917?
[37:00.56]That means there's 2.7 million people watching.
[37:05.68]You mean a thousand nine hundred and seventeen people are watching?
[37:08.51]Come on, I gotta like, I gotta like pretend sometimes.
[37:12.15]No you don't, stop being a lion.
[37:13.87]Whoa!
[37:15.83]Those guys are back.
[37:18.31]Oh fuck, what have I done?
[37:20.75]I can't like, alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[37:22.37]I'm gonna go, we're gonna go down first.
[37:25.59]Guys, can't, spaghetti's cold, it's like... I don't know.
[37:32.66]The spaghetti is cold, it's like... Holy shit, there's a lot of people there.
[37:37.89]We'll get rid of the sausage and just put the spaghetti in there for like 30 seconds.
[37:41.85]Listen to me.
[37:50.51]I wish I knew what this shit even was doing.
[37:52.41]There's no number on the screen.
[37:54.68]It's just entry added.
[37:55.76]I guess.
[38:03.52]Final blow.
[38:04.10]Yeah, yeah.
[38:05.58]I did that before.
[38:07.12]So that's like the finisher.
[38:08.68]Got it.
[38:09.10]Okay.
[38:10.19]Thanks for teaching me that video game.
[38:18.41]Point of this game is you just have to figure out where to go and what to do and fight bosses.
[38:23.99]That's it.
[38:25.18]And it's just really hard.
[38:26.84]Next.
[38:30.28]Well...
[38:33.96]I gotta get through at least, like, the first couple bosses.
[38:36.08]At least the first boss.
[38:37.05]I gotta be at least the first boss, otherwise I can't call myself a streaming video game player.
[38:45.07]This is cool also, but sometimes you play games like this and you showcase what you're able to do, you know?
[38:51.72]Which is not a lot.
[38:54.54]You wanna... You wanna...
[39:02.18]You want to try?
[39:02.72]You want to play?
[39:03.96]No, no, no, no, no.
[39:05.16]I don't want to do that because then, like, we'll... I thought I just died.
[39:08.34]I thought I just fell to my fucking death right there.
[39:12.13]Alright, good.
[39:12.63]Watch out for this crazy guy.
[39:19.35]Yeah, she's only doing this because, like, you guys are wild.
[39:22.01]You should have heard what she said to me earlier.
[39:24.03]She said, you're so awesome, and you're so cool, and you're so fucking cool, and you're so good.
[39:31.27]I don't think I've ever said it before.
[39:32.35]And you are so fucking good at video games, and man, I can't believe it.
[39:35.59]When you beat Dark Souls 3 that time, it was so, I was so happy.
[39:39.53]And I was like, yeah, I know.
[39:42.39]Oh, fuck, this is not good.
[39:43.53]I gotta get rid of this guy real quick.
[39:50.41]In the video game, yeah, I know.
[39:51.65]Alright, I gotta deal with these assholes again.
[39:56.99]Let me just see what happens when I block.
[39:59.19]How much damage does it mitigate just by holding up the weapon?
[40:03.51]Actually, a lot, okay.
[40:04.49]But it stackers you, holy shit.
[40:05.60]Well, now I don't have to be that scared.
[40:09.30]I'd rather just dodge, to be honest.
[40:19.50]You gotta, like, just bring the stamina down, huh?
[40:23.82]Come on, bring him down, bring him down.
[40:30.29]And then it's this, right?
[40:32.19]Cool.
[40:34.39]Great helm, that's different.
[40:36.09]Greaves, that guy, oh, that guy had a lot of shit.
[40:42.50]Um... Great helm.
[40:47.82]Oh, that's way better.
[40:50.41]Strength required Equip okay, there is equipment wait.
[40:54.77]I get it alright.
[40:55.59]Let's see if it makes any difference though I don't think I will be a part of the next general rumble, no I'm a non-violent person Yeah, remember when you said that last time and you said you were gonna like run me over with my car I'm a non-violent person, but I'm going to run you over with your car
[41:19.80]You guy looks like a dick.
[41:28.03]Shit.
[41:30.13]Hey, somebody gave a thousand bits.
[41:31.88]I just heard that very faintly.
[41:38.34]Cool.
[41:39.94]Open.
[41:42.71]It's a baby.
[41:43.37]BabyRage.
[41:44.00]Thank you, Frazzboy.
[41:44.80]What do they say?
[41:45.22]Gotta give it one more try this stream, then I'll try again next stream.
[41:47.82]Maybe even stream after that.
[41:48.94]Jerma, you checked out Ghost Master on GOG yet?
[41:51.72]Or nah?
[41:52.92]I have not.
[41:54.70]I have not.
[41:55.36]But I promise you that when this stream is over, I will check out that game.
[42:00.37]I promise.
[42:01.77]Ghost Master.
[42:02.45]I will see what it is.
[42:04.15]You have my word.
[42:05.81]After this stream.
[42:06.55]I'm going to do...
[42:13.36]Don't worry, don't mean shit.
[42:14.78]You told him yesterday that you were to stream yesterday.
[42:17.86]Well, we had to prepare for the storm.
[42:21.20]Shit, don't make me laugh.
[42:21.96]Don't make me laugh.
[42:22.40]Don't make me fucking giggle right now.
[42:23.48]This is important.
[42:24.16]I can't laugh.
[42:26.35]I can't laugh because I don't want to die.
[42:28.97]This guy's almost at us.
[42:29.71]Damn it.
[42:31.81]Damn it.
[42:35.07]Go for it.
[42:36.05]Make me one too.
[42:37.77]And don't make it so sweet this time.
[42:43.04]Hey, don't make it so sweet this time.
[42:45.24]Oh fuck.
[42:46.18]Anybody know what that's from?
[42:47.02]Anybody know what that's a reference to?
[42:57.35]I hate these fucking guys.
[43:02.37]Get on the ground.
[43:03.97]Get on the fucking ground!
[43:14.00]Oh, what the fuck?
[43:21.26]Where the fuck did I even... Where was that?
[43:22.98]I don't even remember.
[43:23.94]I think it was this way.
[43:25.05]I just gotta get... Ah, yeah, it's this... Fuck me.
[43:31.11]Just put it right there, that's fine.
[43:35.83]Jesus fucking Christ.
[43:40.10]It's not... It's just...
[43:42.23]When can the game brighten up a little bit?
[43:44.63]I'm going to complain about this again.
[43:48.15]Which way?
[43:48.49]I don't even fucking remember.
[43:53.38]George?
[43:53.78]That's so horrible.
[43:59.89]I wonder if I can...
[44:04.65]I don't think I'm fat, thank you.
[44:06.84]Fat?
[44:07.18]Wait, what?
[44:14.25]I would say completely the opposite.
[44:15.55]Shit.
[44:20.75]Hey guys, here comes another complaint.
[44:23.11]Ready for a complaint?
[44:24.91]I'm going to walk out here.
[44:25.72]I can't wait until lightning strikes in the dark fucking area that we're in.
[44:28.60]You know what I'm saying?
[44:32.16]We're going to walk out here.
[44:32.90]I'm going to open this door and it's going to be so cool.
[44:34.52]Because lightning is going to strike when it's raining outside.
[44:37.54]In the dark dungeon area.
[44:38.66]Alright, watch this.
[44:40.99]Oh no, oh no!
[44:42.05]What is going on here?
[44:43.83]It's raining outside and it's dark out?
[44:45.73]It's so dark that you can't even fucking see?
[44:48.66]Whoa!
[44:49.64]Did you see that?
[44:50.50]Lightning!
[44:51.56]Holy shit!
[44:56.40]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[45:07.21]Wait, I was supposed to go this way the whole time?
[45:08.75]Nice.
[45:08.91]What am I supposed to be doing here?
[45:13.70]This is the first boss.
[45:15.20]You led me to the first boss.
[45:17.04]Oh, Derek.
[45:18.56]Oh, no, not Derek.
[45:21.04]Oh, shit.
[45:22.00]I wasn't fucking expecting this.
[45:25.02]What?
[45:25.22]I have to fight Derek already?
[45:29.07]Oh, Derek is actually kind of a piece of shit.
[45:30.83]It's okay.
[45:34.75]Okay, I'm not so scared of Derek anymore.
[45:37.45]Alright, Derek.
[45:38.87]Derek is kind of a piece of shit.
[45:40.59]Alright, first boss down.
[45:41.61]He did it.
[45:41.95]I'm gonna see some fucking PogChamps.
[45:50.49]I don't think that was it.
[45:53.13]That sucks.
[45:53.49]Oh no, he's got a piece of pita bread.
[45:58.61]What's he gonna do with that?
[46:00.91]He's gonna put it on a... Oh!
[46:25.23]He's gonna turn around, he's gonna have a Satan face.
[46:30.35]Oh, no.
[46:31.16]Oh, hi, Derek.
[46:35.46]Hi, Derek.
[46:36.98]Does his name change?
[46:37.74]Please tell me his name's like Donovan.
[46:39.56]I would laugh so hard.
[46:41.36]Donovan.
[46:41.95]Oh, it's not Donovan.
[46:44.29]Alright, let's just be easy here.
[46:51.08]I'm just gonna watch him for a second.
[46:52.31]He does a charge.
[46:53.95]Like that.
[46:54.49]Let me first try this fucking idiot.
[47:05.35]He's kind of a dumbass.
[47:10.54]Yeah, no way.
[47:13.60]You're super funny!
[47:16.62]No, I'm seeing him.
[47:17.34]No, no.
[47:17.60]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[47:18.74]What do I do?
[47:19.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[47:20.92]What is this?
[47:23.68]Do I have, like, super moves?
[47:27.38]What does this do?
[47:34.36]First try, boys and girls.
[47:36.12]Okay.
[47:48.92]Is he gonna put another cube in that guy or what?
[48:09.40]Somebody shoot a gun?
[48:11.00]Why do they have a gun?
[48:14.42]Since when do they have guns?
[48:17.98]They've been like hitting me with axes and shit.
[48:19.86]Why do they have like- What the fuck?
[48:25.27]I did not expect it to be guns.
[48:26.33]Okay.
[48:28.03]Why are you looking at me like I'm supposed to have the answers?
[48:33.17]I don't have any of the answers.
[48:35.05]Here comes a flashback.
[48:44.90]Slow bullets.
[48:56.46]I like this so far.
[48:57.20]No, it's pretty cool.
[49:00.67]Game over.
[49:11.78]Oh, that was just an elaborate opening cutscene.
[49:14.84]Nice!
[49:15.64]We got... Oh, brightness!
[49:17.80]Water!
[49:18.24]Pirates!
[49:23.28]Oh, no!
[49:37.56]How can I swim in armor?
[49:38.46]I don't know.
[49:39.94]But I'm going to mute for the cutscene.
[49:43.48]The hell off was lost.
[49:45.91]The trowel sank.
[49:48.31]While the hope vanished without a trace.
[49:51.85]The good news of the blight abouts happened was nothing but lies.
[49:56.80]Only Liefda remained.
[50:06.53]Yeah, look at that.
[50:07.25]Look at that.
[50:07.59]You know what that is?
[50:08.15]I got that in a Quidditch tournament.
[50:09.49]That's the fucking Quidditch.
[50:11.33]Got it.
[50:12.25]Alright, back to... Okay, I'll be quiet.
[50:40.82]Alright, so... That was just like a 45-minute opening, like, thing.
[50:44.99]Okay.
[50:46.13]Before I begin my preparations for landfall, I leaf once more through... I leaf once more through that curious bo... Okay, I thought he said he was leaving.
[50:53.90]Like, I leaf once more.
[50:56.23]have chanced upon record recorded inside on the memoirs of a sailor who had once paid visit to the land of zip hangu precisely how this document wound up in the hold of this ship when its author clearly belonged to the crew of a different boat is beyond me but here I am pouring over its pages all the same and not for the first time this voyage I may add what fascinated me above all else were the memoirs many accounts of zampangu's diverse armor and weaponry oh
[51:23.75]Oh, okay.
[51:24.71]This is important.
[51:26.44]Alright.
[51:29.46]Kim?
[51:30.12]Yes?
[51:31.88]You get to choose.
[51:32.56]What weapon?
[51:33.54]Oh, I get to choose?
[51:34.34]You get to choose.
[51:35.06]This is the weapon that I apparently prefer.
[51:37.64]I get to choose.
[51:46.25]You get to choose.
[51:50.05]Sword, dual sword, spear, axe, or kusarigama.
[51:54.08]Whatever the hell that is.
[51:55.18]That one.
[51:57.02]Dexterity.
[51:57.40]A weapon that combines sickle and weighted chain.
[51:59.44]Mastery of this unusual weapon requires a deep understanding of many special techniques.
[52:03.52]The sickle allows for quick strikes in close range, and the chain weight can be thrown to add range to the weapon's offensive repertoire.
[52:09.45]Yep.
[52:09.85]Choose that one.
[52:11.09]Okay.
[52:13.53]Kusarigama or go home.
[52:15.11]Well, I'm going to do it.
[52:19.93]Okay.
[52:22.02]We're doing the chain with the sickle on the end.
[52:27.34]Apparently that was... Hammer and sickle.
[52:34.28]No room for negotiation.
[52:36.73]No, game over.
[52:38.83]Game over.
[52:39.47]That's like the hardest weapon to use.
[52:43.37]Game is done.
[52:45.07]Well, whatever.
[52:45.55]We'll see what happens.
[52:49.71]Dex leveling.
[52:51.75]Aw, he's being so cute right now.
[52:54.29]He's just, like, lying on you.
[52:55.14]I know.
[52:56.42]Auto MVP.
[52:58.42]Alright.
[52:58.64]Samurai is master of many armaments and trains for combat in every imaginable scenario.
[53:01.96]If I were to use another weapon, which would I choose?
[53:05.94]Okay.
[53:09.44]I mean, so, this one is, like, advanced technique.
[53:12.70]What's just, like, the strength weapon?
[53:14.68]I'm sure it's probably axe.
[53:18.00]That's like the bitch way out.
[53:20.06]Do you really want to choose the bitch way out?
[53:22.58]I mean... Do the dual swords.
[53:25.54]Did you see the first weapon that I picked?
[53:27.16]That's like the fucking extreme.
[53:29.00]I picked that weapon.
[53:30.56]That one is hard to use.
[53:32.84]Well, don't choose the bitch way out.
[53:34.59]Do the dual swords.
[53:37.35]What is this one?
[53:37.91]Skill?
[53:39.47]Dual swords?
[53:40.07]Alright.
[53:43.09]Fine.
[53:47.17]Excuse me.
[53:48.19]Excuse me.
[53:51.37]Oh, shit.
[53:52.15]I just missed what that said.
[53:52.99]Did somebody screenshot that?
[53:54.59]Somebody tell me what it was.
[53:55.47]Because I didn't see it.
[53:57.49]Eight million gods.
[53:58.43]Look at this.
[53:58.81]Eight million bosses in this game.
[54:00.52]And other deities.
[54:01.86]Exactly how this figure was derived, I can only imagine.
[54:04.72]But as I cast my gaze to the shore, I was struck by the sensation of some mythical power that has been keeping watch over me.
[54:13.25]Gee, that reminds me of Sarah... Let's do it together, same thing.
[54:17.09]Sarah's... Sarah's area, read the next one.
[54:20.25]I pull out the memoir once more and survey each page until I arrive at the guardian spirit that best matches the force that I'm fucking seeing in my life.
[54:29.22]I'm sensing.
[54:30.06]And it is the lion.
[54:32.26]The lionfish.
[54:33.54]Don't even... Oh, wait, hold on.
[54:36.42]Uh... Fuck.
[54:40.36]I feel like it's gonna have to be this one.
[54:41.76]I'd do the dog...
[54:47.20]What face?
[54:50.77]Let's do it together.
[54:53.35]Cult.
[54:57.71]I mean, if I'm doing a skill and dex-based weapon, I kind of have to be the bird, right?
[55:04.70]I don't see why not.
[55:07.22]I don't see why, at least.
[55:08.36]It's going to have to be the bird.
[55:11.64]If I was doing strength, yeah, it's going to have to be skill.
[55:14.17]Oh.
[55:18.36]To be honest, I was going to see if I could go over Jerma's house when Neo came out.
[55:21.18]What did you say, Star?
[55:22.90]To play together?
[55:24.56]Like, no joke?
[55:26.94]Wait, what?
[55:28.36]You should have told me that.
[55:29.48]You could have come over.
[55:30.10]Hey, you know what?
[55:32.14]Come over right now.
[55:34.66]Come over right now.
[55:35.24]There's only like a blizzard going on right now.
[55:41.00]Star, we can do co-op.
[55:42.36]Don't worry.
[55:47.85]Am I neglecting Star?
[55:49.06]I'm not.
[55:50.20]He's free to do what he pleases.
[55:56.62]Star has a wife and four Georges.
[55:58.81]Yeah, he's got four Georges.
[56:00.09]Alright, um, let's... I'm just gonna scale to Dexterity 1.
[56:07.63]He wants to sit next to me, his master, his best friend in the world.
[56:11.01]Then why is he sitting next to me?
[56:12.31]Because you placed him there.
[56:13.55]No, I placed him over there to sit next to you.
[56:16.17]And he came over here to me.
[56:17.85]Oh, run the tape back.
[56:18.98]Let's see.
[56:19.54]Oh, there's no facecam.
[56:20.26]Never mind.
[56:20.62]Don't run that tape back.
[56:22.52]No facecam.
[56:23.18]If you're a first-time player, we recommend playing the tutorial.
[56:25.38]Do you wish to begin the tutorial?
[56:26.78]Oh, my.
[56:27.36]I don't know about that.
[56:28.48]No.
[56:29.16]No, I kind of have to.
[56:30.18]No.
[56:31.04]No, I have to.
[56:32.06]I have to.
[56:32.52]It's like, I don't know what the fuck is going on in this game.
[56:34.20]I have to know.
[56:36.93]Like, it's gonna tell me, like, advanced techniques and shit, you know?
[56:42.41]Custody battle?
[56:43.99]For Otto?
[56:47.61]Um, Star said that you're... He's with better Jeremy now.
[56:50.65]I don't know what that means.
[56:51.89]Oh, wow.
[56:52.35]That's a... He's cool.
[56:54.55]He's cool.
[56:57.00]He's cool.
[56:57.64]He's cool, dude.
[56:58.98]What did Spencer say?
[57:00.60]Spencer, what did you say?
[57:01.78]I missed it.
[57:04.89]I can't even see it.
[57:05.61]Chat is going too fast.
[57:07.33]Well, hi, Spencer.
[57:08.03]Alright, I'll wear the dojo.
[57:09.53]I'm just gonna learn some shit.
[57:11.25]Because there's a lot of shit going on here that I need to know.
[57:15.15]Objective is shown in the top right corner.
[57:16.59]Okay, yeah.
[57:20.47]Two-hour tutorial stream?
[57:23.67]Oh, yeah.
[57:25.59]Yeah, status menu, equipment, I know.
[57:28.43]I just want to know, once I learn about the stances, I know there's like four fucking stances in this game.
[57:33.72]That's like super important.
[57:34.58]Dude, your wardrobe changed.
[57:36.92]Alright, get a feel for the game.
[57:38.70]Okay.
[57:40.88]Read.
[57:41.18]Are we gonna read shit?
[57:42.82]What?
[57:45.20]The quick attack is fast.
[57:46.08]It doesn't consume much ki, but it causes light damage.
[57:48.60]Strong attack is powerful.
[57:50.79]If you achieve a zeal, you will not be able to da-da-da-da.
[57:57.23]Okay.
[57:57.45]Can you take the weapon out, please?
[57:58.71]Tutorials are crutches for battle players.
[58:01.74]Look, there's like four stances in this game.
[58:03.80]I need to know what that fucking means.
[58:07.83]You want me to go get my ass kicked?
[58:11.97]I don't want to get my fucking face beaten.
[58:15.55]Thanks, Andrew, for the three-month resubscription.
[58:18.08]Yeah, sorry.
[58:19.50]We've been missing a lot.
[58:20.80]We're just sitting on a couch.
[58:22.90]Cheese crumb says cheers.
[58:24.94]Dog cam, please.
[58:26.84]I promise I'll do a dog cam before the stream is over.
[58:29.14]You'll see, Otto.
[58:31.48]And just Otto, and then we're going to leave the room.
[58:37.74]The lock on, I know how to do that.
[58:38.84]Thank you, Gummy Monk, for the 1500 bits.
[58:48.72]He looks like a weeb Sylvester Stallone.
[58:52.55]Switch to the weapon?
[58:53.89]I would...
[58:57.10]I know, but I just wanted to tell me what to do.
[59:02.17]Yeah, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[59:08.73]Yeah, kill him in the ground.
[59:10.45]I just want to know about the stances.
[59:11.71]That's all I want to know.
[59:14.06]I don't know.
[59:14.60]Okay, this is all I care about.
[59:15.94]It's the only thing I care about.
[59:23.13]High stance emphasizes attack power.
[59:25.66]It allows for powerful techniques.
[59:27.84]Mid stance is good for defense.
[59:29.34]It has a wide range of techniques and is easy to use.
[59:32.16]Low stance is good for dodging and doesn't consume much ki and also maintains your guard as you move.
[59:37.04]Alright, so low stance for moving around dodging, mid for defense, and high for power.
[59:47.51]This is high stance, so this is just straight-up power.
[59:50.55]Okay, cool.
[59:54.69]Got it.
[59:55.75]Interesting.
[59:58.25]This is mid stance.
[59:59.19]This is emphasizing on defense.
[60:00.77]I think that's the general, the basic stance.
[60:04.00]Somebody gave some money.
[60:06.99]Unit 232, 232-1.
[60:08.19]Thanks for the 1500.
[60:10.99]Is this an anime Dark Souls?
[60:12.05]I was late to the stream.
[60:12.79]Jerma would know.
[60:14.95]This is pretty much just like Dark Souls-ish.
[60:21.26]But with a little bit of a twist on it, I guess you could say.
[60:27.34]Here's the one that decides it's dodging and moving around and guarding.
[60:32.01]Thank you, StinkyBagBoy, for resubscribing for four months.
[60:34.85]Thanks, dude.
[60:36.29]Yo, grats on the sub button.
[60:37.58]Arcadum, Arcadum, you got a sub button?
[60:38.88]Did you really?
[60:40.66]Holy shit, dude.
[60:41.98]Congratulations, man.
[60:44.06]Grats on the sub button, dude.
[60:45.50]These are quick attacks.
[60:50.24]Okay.
[60:50.87]I like this dance a lot.
[60:54.35]You guys don't know who Arcadum is.
[60:56.39]That's the other Jeremy that Star was talking about.
[61:06.23]I was just gonna call you.
[61:08.47]You were just gonna call me?
[61:09.51]I was gonna just... Yeah.
[61:13.03]Okay.
[61:13.87]Uh, hello, you?
[61:17.78]That's all I wanted to know.
[61:18.42]I just wanted to know about the stances, and if I didn't know that, then I would've been a total fucking idiot.
[61:24.24]Call Crying Heaster.
[61:28.21]Can you do the rest of the stream doing an anime voice?
[61:32.39]No.
[61:32.87]Yeah.
[61:34.31]No.
[61:34.79]No, no.
[61:35.13]We're not doing anime voices.
[61:36.97]That's for, like, when we do an anime stream.
[61:38.85]Alright, hold on.
[61:40.33]What is this?
[61:40.69]Key pulse?
[61:42.95]Key pulse.
[61:43.31]Itakimasu.
[61:45.05]What did you say?
[61:47.55]What was that word?
[61:48.68]Itakimasu.
[61:49.72]What is it?
[61:51.72]Look it up.
[61:52.57]Look it up.
[61:52.87]I don't even know how the words are in there.
[61:55.60]Itakimasu.
[61:58.12]Itakimasu.
[61:59.58]Does that mean welcome to the cage?
[62:02.88]Because that's where we're about to go in the cage.
[62:08.73]Anime stream.
[62:09.37]Oh, God.
[62:10.03]Here it comes.
[62:14.07]She just called Jerma a rude word.
[62:15.79]You did?
[62:16.13]No, I didn't.
[62:20.44]Oh, okay, good.
[62:20.88]Welcome to the cage, weeb.
[62:27.36]Oh my god.
[62:27.78]I can't understand you.
[62:29.80]Oh my lord.
[62:30.06]That's not good.
[62:31.74]Alright.
[62:47.04]Alright, wild blue lights gather around you after an attack.
[62:49.90]There's R1.
[62:50.40]It recovers your ki.
[62:52.45]Huh.
[62:54.21]Okay.
[62:56.19]Good thing I did the fucking tutorial.
[62:57.64]Because how the hell would I have known to do this?
[63:02.10]So when blue lights gather around you after an attack.
[63:05.64]Ooh, alright.
[63:07.68]Oh my lord, that's so... Well, I actually really was thinking him for the food, so... I mean, I'm not trying to perpetuate any kind of anger at all.
[63:13.49]Shit, there we go.
[63:16.43]That's really interesting.
[63:17.31]Alright, if I did not know about that, you guys think I would have ever fucking figured that out if I didn't do this tutorial?
[63:22.15]That, like, after you attack, when those blue lights surround you, you time it right, and you regain ki?
[63:26.94]There's no way I would have known that.
[63:30.34]The third tutorial would have told you?
[63:32.26]What are you talking about?
[63:37.34]Another world become the Yokai.
[63:40.10]Speed is great.
[63:41.02]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[63:42.02]Well, just fucking show me.
[63:47.86]How do I do it?
[63:51.11]Oh, okay.
[63:51.89]Activates when you successfully execute a key pulse to regain maximum key.
[63:54.49]Whatever.
[63:57.13]Yo, Kai.
[63:59.77]Oh, you have Vietnamese subscribers in here.
[64:02.33]Oh, that's cool.
[64:04.49]That's cool.
[64:06.89]I'm ready.
[64:07.88]How do I get out of this?
[64:10.30]How do I, like, leave tutorial?
[64:16.46]I don't think I can.
[64:17.51]You have to finish it, right?
[64:18.73]God damn it.
[64:19.17]I just want to know what the standard is.
[64:20.19]Alright.
[64:21.77]Let's, um... Do people have, like, actual characters in there?
[64:26.28]That's cool.
[64:27.22]Cool!
[64:27.80]Alright.
[64:28.34]Uh, you can equip weapons with a status menu.
[64:29.56]Yeah, I know that.
[64:30.88]Yeah, they are.
[64:32.84]Wooden axe.
[64:33.68]Uh, I did earlier, yeah.
[64:38.09]You can give him something if you want.
[64:39.43]Just give him, like, a little half cup.
[64:42.26]Alright.
[64:43.82]There it is.
[64:46.00]Visit that.
[64:46.86]Go that way!
[64:47.30]Go!
[64:47.62]Go!
[64:47.96]Go!
[64:48.28]Go!
[64:53.03]Wait, there's ranged weapons too?
[64:58.53]I don't have any ranged weapons.
[65:02.03]I'm assuming switching between weapons is going to be an important thing.
[65:08.21]Next tutorial.
[65:08.84]Let's go.
[65:17.91]Shooting?
[65:18.49]My god.
[65:30.02]One second, guys.
[66:29.91]Hey, one sec.
[66:30.77]He's back.
[66:32.19]Alright, let's keep going.
[66:34.35]R2 holding L2.
[66:35.33]Switch ammo tight.
[66:36.20]Zero square for normal.
[66:37.94]Special.
[66:39.54]Let's just do it.
[66:42.04]Can't carry anymore.
[66:43.07]This is fucking Diablo.
[66:51.89]Uh, whatever.
[66:52.39]Alright.
[66:52.71]So L2 and then R2 switch ammo is different ammo kind.
[67:00.18]Uh, those arrows.
[67:01.16]Alright.
[67:03.46]Alright.
[67:03.80]Well, shoot the dummies.
[67:08.69]That's interesting.
[67:09.47]Alright.
[67:12.49]Okay.
[67:13.61]Um,
[67:19.77]R3 is zoom.
[67:20.79]I mean, I kind of don't care anymore.
[67:22.63]Like, I want to play the game.
[67:24.39]Is there a I don't give a shit anymore video game?
[67:26.26]Please just skip the rest of this.
[67:27.32]That's what you get.
[67:30.72]It is what I get, but I just wanted to know what the fucking stances did.
[67:34.70]Can't carry any more of this item.
[67:35.96]Can't carry any more of this item.
[67:38.74]Well, what?
[67:42.23]Yeah.
[67:48.27]See, where am I?
[67:50.36]That does 1100 damage?
[67:51.40]Holy shit.
[67:55.34]Alright, well, that's cool.
[68:01.04]What happened in the chat?
[68:02.30]What did Star say?
[68:02.90]Something awful?
[68:05.88]Alright, we're done here, right?
[68:06.96]That's it.
[68:07.72]Thank you for doing this.
[68:09.14]Item shortcut, yeah, I know.
[68:12.05]I know about the item shortcuts.

[68:36.96]Thanks for the bits, dude.
[68:39.10]Thanks to anybody that's...
[68:42.05]currently doing anything, right?
[68:44.53]Oh, so those are like the soul.
[68:46.63]Okay, that's cool.
[68:48.81]Those stone things are crushing like the soul fragments in Dark Souls.
[68:54.20]That's cool.
[68:57.18]Living weapons.
[68:58.42]I just did this shit.
[68:59.56]Okay.
[69:01.50]Let's just...
[69:07.71]So that's when you activate it and it just turns into the psycho mode.
[69:09.89]I got it.
[69:13.89]Big attack.
[69:14.49]Cool.
[69:16.11]Alright, all the missions in the tutorial are like, everything's been done.

[69:43.91]Oh my god, I can't believe I just remembered it now.
[69:45.82]I'm so excited.
[69:47.60]I'm so excited for that Oreo cookie cake.
[69:50.08]Do we have like a full fucking Oreo cookie cake?
[69:51.84]It's insane.
[69:53.44]Ice cream cake.
[69:54.36]He like walked by it in the grocery store and he's like, I'm getting this.
[69:57.70]And he just threw it in the shopping cart.
[70:00.21]I'm still in the tutorial.
[70:01.25]I've just been taking my time, man.
[70:02.41]You don't want to fuck around with these games.
[70:04.21]I'm social eating right now.
[70:06.11]Jeremy is playing, I know.
[70:08.71]Oreo vomit incoming.
[70:09.93]You eating Oreos right now?
[70:15.63]This actually might be bad because I'm lactose intolerant, too.
[70:20.22]Yeah, I mean, that's... And that's, like... Let's not fuck that Greek yogurt.
[70:24.52]You'll be alright.
[70:27.16]Vomit stream.
[70:27.90]It's total.
[70:29.42]It's very total.
[70:31.30]Why are you eating five total?
[70:35.88]Girl, you're crazy.
[70:38.20]Alright, this is the start of the video game.
[70:44.88]Took an hour to start the video game.
[70:46.63]Skill points obtained.
[70:47.75]Open the status menu via that to learn new skills.
[70:51.99]Let's put on my weapon.
[70:55.64]Okay.
[70:57.20]Learn skills.
[71:00.59]Sword, dual swords.
[71:04.03]Changing to another stance on a successful ki pulse increases the amount of ki.
[71:08.51]High stance only.
[71:09.31]Activates when you recover full ki from a ki pulse.
[71:11.31]Reduces the damage caused by your next attack.
[71:13.65]Grapples an enemy who is out of ki, then follows up with a powerful... Yeah.
[71:18.97]Uh, yeah.
[71:21.75]Sure, without a doubt.
[71:24.35]I have another one I can do.
[71:25.87]What about dual swords?
[71:30.83]I mean... Let's do this too.
[71:33.60]Just in case I fucking hate this weapon.
[71:35.86]You know, you never know.
[71:37.50]I might like despise this thing.
[71:43.74]Okay, so... This is... I... I ain't gonna like that.
[71:48.94]I ain't gonna... I don't think I'm gonna like that.
[71:53.18]What about the high stance?
[72:00.80]It's cool.
[72:01.57]We'll see.
[72:02.05]We'll see.
[72:02.79]I'm gonna give it a chance.
[72:10.25]Roadhog rides again.
[72:11.27]Level up.
[72:12.35]Make offering.
[72:14.56]Claim DLC items, alright.
[72:16.84]Change guardian spirit level up.
[72:18.34]I don't think I can do anything right now, but I need to do skill and dexterity.
[72:27.66]Capacity of your ninjutsu and then the mountain guard activate the special effects of more technical weapons.
[72:33.66]Okay, so I'm a skill and dexterity guy.
[72:36.06]I don't know what the rest of that shit means, but I'm sure I'll find out.
[72:40.68]This is Dark Souls.
[72:41.53]Welcome to Dark Souls.
[72:44.50]And let's go.
[72:46.28]Let's go get our ass kicked again.
[72:51.92]Those are the bonfires.
[72:53.02]Okay.
[72:55.30]Lower right hand corner is the souls.
[72:59.72]Alright.
[73:07.72]What is this place?
[73:11.14]This house.
[73:12.38]Not safe for me, Bruce.
[73:14.03]I don't even know what that is.
[73:15.95]I don't even understand.
[73:20.97]You alright?
[73:21.43]Oh, no.
[73:22.83]Oh, I can sprint.
[73:24.63]Good to know that I can sprint.
[73:26.19]It only took me like an hour to figure that out.
[73:27.73]Okay.
[73:30.53]Let's go this way.
[73:33.41]This is a map.
[73:35.18]That is a map.
[73:40.15]I like the high stance of this, though.
[73:48.11]Oh, that's cool.
[73:49.95]That has a lot of range on it.
[73:51.23]I actually don't mind that at all.
[73:56.87]Holy shit, I just ripped that guy apart.
[73:58.49]Okay, cool.
[73:58.89]Alright, now I like this game.
[74:02.67]Now I like this game.
[74:03.49]There's a big Cheshire Trust in here.
[74:04.87]What's in there?
[74:06.15]Whoa!
[74:06.31]Somebody in the room with me.
[74:07.93]Is there...
[74:09.39]No, I'm just having a fucking panic attack for no reason.
[74:11.65]What is this?
[74:12.89]Why is it already open?
[74:13.49]Did I get armor?
[74:28.27]I think I did.
[74:33.72]Dude, that yogurt is still in my throat.
[74:38.44]What?
[74:40.62]That yogurt will not go down.
[74:43.86]What?
[74:45.30]That yogurt is still in your throat going down.
[74:48.08]It's not moving.
[74:50.04]That's fucking gross.
[74:53.75]Shut up.
[74:56.91]It's still in my throat.
[74:58.85]What does that mean?
[75:01.11]I don't know.
[75:04.11]Remember about the key charge.
[75:05.43]Yeah, I gotta remember that.
[75:06.17]I'm trying to keep in mind.
[75:07.67]Alright, um... Not here?
[75:16.09]Shit, shit, shit, shit!
[75:18.07]Move!
[75:21.38]Hey!
[75:29.83]Okay, I kind of just got my ass kicked there from over here.
[75:34.27]Yeah.
[75:35.05]Is that healing?
[75:35.53]Yes, it is.
[75:37.83]Okay.
[75:41.00]What is this?
[75:42.42]Bloody Grave?
[75:44.10]Fight Revenant?
[75:44.84]What the fuck does that mean?
[75:47.70]What is that?
[75:53.14]I have no idea what this is.
[75:55.80]Did somebody die here and I can fight their body?
[75:58.68]I'm just curious what this is.
[75:59.56]Is this another player?
[76:06.15]This is another player.
[76:06.83]I'm dead.
[76:16.18]What?
[76:19.22]What the fuck was that?
[76:20.16]I just fell down in the water?
[76:24.72]I didn't know you could do that.
[76:28.13]What the fuck?
[76:30.01]What?
[76:31.09]That's fucking horse shit.
[76:34.31]Dude, you suck.
[76:35.35]How was I supposed to know?
[76:36.09]Look, it's like, oh, you can walk on this, but you can't walk on this one.
[76:39.79]I almost did it again.
[76:41.53]Wait, just test it out.
[76:42.87]No, I need to get my souls back.
[76:44.79]I'm not going to fuck that up again.
[76:47.08]What the fuck was that?
[76:50.78]Like, I can kill this guy very easily.
[76:55.68]Like, just don't fall in the water.
[76:56.88]So wait, red names are developers?
[77:05.37]That's kind of cool.
[77:06.11]Oh shit.
[77:26.52]One more, one more, one more.
[77:30.86]Walk into it.
[77:35.27]Well, that just gave me some shit.
[77:37.61]A nice axe and some plate armor.
[77:39.65]Okay.
[77:42.35]That's cool.
[77:42.93]Let's see what that is.
[77:43.79]I'm not supposed to be using the axe though, but I mean, might as well just put it on, right?
[77:54.50]Not plate armor.
[77:56.76]Arm guards, cool.
[77:57.47]Alright, let's keep going.
[78:00.63]Keep it moving.
[78:03.13]This time don't fall in the fucking water.
[78:04.49]And watch out for this idiot.
[78:05.67]That guy's not... Okay, I'm cool.
[78:14.60]Okay, well I thought I dodged that.
[78:16.08]I guess not.
[78:23.81]I'm gonna go this way.
[78:26.79]Because why not?
[78:30.51]What does it take a level model to change stance at?
[78:32.63]Well, thanks for telling me.
[78:33.91]That guy's got a huge fucking spear.
[78:43.72]So you earn stamina when you use certain weapons?
[78:47.50]That's actually really cool.
[78:49.52]Interesting.
[78:52.88]Are you writing in the chat?
[78:54.78]Are you chatting?
[78:56.10]Yeah, I'm trying.
[78:56.84]I'm trying to like not talk as much because I am serving as a distraction.
[79:03.93]What?
[79:04.23]No you're not.
[79:07.45]That's not true.
[79:08.53]Shit, I need to do that more often.
[79:09.83]Fuck!
[79:18.05]And change penalty weapon.
[79:20.37]You got it.
[79:26.17]Here's another developer.
[79:28.71]Level 5.
[79:29.46]Should I even fucking attempt this?
[79:31.34]This guy might kick the shit out of me.
[79:32.96]Yeah.
[79:33.64]You don't know you're gonna get your shit kicked out of anyways.
[79:36.67]Alright, well let's do it.
[79:55.75]I'm trying to get good.
[80:04.79]I'm in the process of trying to be good.
[80:09.97]Fuck me in the face.
[80:10.89]Fuck me in my face!
[80:12.67]Don't do it.
[80:13.05]This guy's too high for me.
[80:19.87]Jesus.
[80:21.76]Bandit armor?
[80:23.12]Nine glory.
[80:24.52]I have no more healing, no.
[80:29.20]I think you guys, I think you guys, uh, I have no more.
[80:38.36]I need, like, another bonfire.
[80:42.98]What?
[80:43.28]Okay, that's, you know, that's not fair.
[80:45.05]That's not fair.
[80:46.43]That is absolutely not fucking fair.
[80:48.71]Guy comes down here, fucking rafters to the right.
[80:53.40]I need to do the R1 more too, I'm not doing it as often.
[80:57.46]I'm dead.
[81:00.44]Guy jumps out of the fucking right house, just like... all the houses that you can't go in.
[81:06.00]This is like fucking Grand Theft Auto 3 with these houses.
[81:08.39]You can't go in, but some guy jumps out.
[81:11.43]It's a bunch of fucking bullshit.
[81:14.71]I'm not fighting any more game developers, alright?
[81:17.53]No more of that shit.
[81:20.49]I ain't gonna fight a fucking other guy that's like fucking five levels higher than me.
[81:25.15]Game dev.
[81:26.69]What the fuck am I thinking?
[81:27.79]What is this?
[81:39.10]That axe is so good.
[81:39.82]Should I just be using the axe right now?
[81:42.08]No.
[81:45.66]I gotta be the first boss.
[81:47.74]I'm not gonna rage quit this game.
[81:51.01]I'm gonna rage quit the game because like I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
[82:32.37]Yeah, he probably is.
[82:35.95]He's probably happy that we're chillin' with him.
[82:40.20]The dog.
[82:40.94]My god.
[82:46.44]My lord.
[82:52.30]Next.
[82:54.36]So what is this thing over here?
[82:57.02]What does this thing do?
[82:57.58]Does it do anything in particular?
[83:00.02]Because I can't seem to interact with it.
[83:02.04]It looks like I should... Okay, what the fuck is that?
[83:04.11]What did you just do?
[83:05.67]Guide to... Is that a little toad?
[83:09.31]Like a little Super Mario toad brother?
[83:13.73]Okay.
[83:14.83]Well, see you later, buddy.
[83:16.55]Nice knowing you.
[83:18.91]I guess.
[83:19.51]Whatever.
[83:22.24]Remember, watch out for the guy that jumps out of the side of the house.
[83:24.70]I'm trying to get around.
[83:32.38]Just climb over the back of the couch.
[83:35.61]Oh god!
[83:36.99]You made it, good.
[83:49.13]Gun, my shit's up here.
[83:52.61]There it is.
[83:53.13]Alright, watch out for this guy.
[83:59.50]He's gonna go... That is aggressive.
[84:05.30]He's kinda lucky.
[84:10.21]Stone!
[84:13.78]Alright, back to reality.
[84:16.36]You know, there goes, you know, there goes gravity.
[84:20.39]There it goes.
[84:21.75]What's in here?
[84:27.05]Armor, spirit stone.
[84:28.55]Now can you, do you have to level up at one of those shrines?
[84:32.59]I think you do.
[84:33.05]I'm pretty sure you do.
[84:35.05]Oh, I don't know.
[84:37.96]Scary.
[84:44.08]Shit, I got... Learning how to effectively do that, the R1 after moving, is gonna take a little bit of getting used to, but it's all good.
[84:57.57]Spaghetti.
[84:59.39]Spaghetti!
[85:00.53]How do I get that?
[85:01.47]I don't know.
[85:04.57]Down or up?
[85:05.39]Let's go... Let's go up.
[85:14.65]That's some random shit.
[85:17.45]Dude just fucking blocked all my shit, huh?
[85:22.62]You are heavily armored.
[85:30.28]I don't have like a chi gauge thing.
[85:35.74]That's how you do it.
[85:36.24]You gotta get around him and just whack the shit out of him.
[85:38.36]Like that.
[85:40.23]Ooh, he dodged.
[85:41.01]Nice dodge, dude.
[85:43.27]And he's done.
[85:46.99]What the fuck is going on?
[85:47.75]What did you... That just scared the fuck out of me.
[85:49.75]Holy shit.
[85:50.15]Okay.
[85:54.59]Let's go to the regular stance.
[86:01.47]No, I'm not fighting any more game developers.
[86:04.25]No.
[86:05.21]No, this is gonna cause problems.
[86:13.70]Shit, that was close.
[86:15.02]Oh my fucking lord, are you serious?
[86:18.67]Oh my god.
[86:19.97]Okay, we gotta go boss to the wall.
[86:21.17]I gotta go boss to the fucking wall.
[86:24.07]There we go.
[86:25.59]Send the fucking eagle.
[86:33.69]What the fuck happened to my health?
[86:35.65]What happened to my health?
[86:45.64]Jesus.
[86:52.59]These guys are so...
[87:06.33]Well, holy shit.
[87:12.37]That was a nice one and a half seconds of Dynasty Warriors, apparently.
[87:24.46]You know, something tells me.
[87:30.08]I think you might be bad at this game.
[87:33.56]No, I don't think it's that.
[87:40.64]Or it might be that.
[87:41.58]Who knows?
[87:42.00]I think he might be bad at this game, too.
[87:52.11]Look at his fell off the cliff.
[87:54.27]He just, like, tripped and fell down.
[87:55.93]What a dummy.
[88:00.29]I think I have the weapon that's picked the equivalent of using, like, the cane in Bloodborne, though, unfortunately.
[88:06.22]I was told- Star told me!
[88:07.56]I was warned specifically from Star himself.
[88:11.82]This was a dumb idea.
[88:13.29]But I'm doing it anyways.
[88:14.23]Fuck it.
[88:14.67]Who cares.
[88:17.85]Oh, I went to skill point.
[88:24.95]Otto would have beaten the first boss by now.
[88:28.91]I don't think so.
[88:32.91]It's alright.
[88:33.27]We're back to where we were.
[88:33.89]We're fine.
[88:36.64]Yeah, they're right.
[88:37.46]I would have won the game already.
[88:40.87]Maybe you would've.
[88:42.65]That would've been pretty remarkable.
[88:46.40]I'm gonna die again.
[88:50.76]Just wasted so much fucking time.
[88:52.58]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[88:53.66]Get- you fucking piece of shit game.
[88:57.56]I'm actually mad right now.
[88:58.88]I'm actually fucking angry.
[89:02.93]I'm not even like- I'm at the fucking Super Mario boat level.
[89:06.45]And I'm already angry at this game.
[89:34.38]Alright, you know what?
[89:35.50]I think this weapon just eats shit, if I'm honest.
[89:37.83]I'm going to be fucking honest.
[89:38.63]I think this weapon sucks, asshole.
[89:40.05]You mean the one I picked up?
[89:41.01]This one sucks.
[89:42.09]Well, that's because you suck.
[89:43.33]Oh, yeah?
[89:43.69]Watch this.
[89:47.01]Oh, yeah?
[89:47.85]Watch this.
[89:50.03]I'm dead.
[89:50.93]Hi, Luke.
[89:51.41]What time is it in England right now?
[90:04.05]I have no idea.
[90:06.83]I think it's 9, 10, 11, 12, 1 AM?
[90:08.17]12 AM?
[90:08.37]In bed?
[90:08.53]I watched it.
[90:09.01]It's not even my weapon of choice!
[90:29.90]Alright, let's try to get to the top of this fucking cliff.
[90:33.06]Before I legit like shit my pants in anger.
[90:38.40]Like before I literally diarrhea my pants in fucking rage.
[90:46.79]How do I get the dual swords?
[90:48.07]I don't want to use the fucking... I don't want to use the claw machine game anymore.
[90:58.79]Time to collect the gamer license.
[91:04.07]Alright, let's keep going.
[91:11.62]I will do this.
[91:12.56]Alright, I'm just gonna shut up.
[91:14.32]I'm sitting on a fucking couch right now.
[91:16.14]I gotta stop being so comfy.
[91:36.40]Somebody just gave money.
[91:44.31]What was it?
[91:45.67]What does he say?
[91:47.73]Let's have a diarrhea rage?
[91:50.31]Thanks dude.
[92:04.06]It's going to heal.
[92:05.58]I need to get to where I was before.
[92:06.88]Hi, little BB.
[92:11.20]You know who you are.
[92:12.62]I'm talking to you.
[92:16.75]I want to dodge around him.
[92:17.65]I want to dodge around him, not into his fucking body.
[92:19.61]Come on, man.
[92:20.07]What is up with this shit?
[92:23.27]What is up with that shit?
[92:24.27]There we go.
[92:28.19]Okay, keep going.
[92:29.67]Little BB.
[92:30.77]How the hell am I going to deal with this up here with these five dudes that come up
[92:35.64]Alright, here we go.
[92:36.20]Let's try it again.
[92:36.76]I wonder, can I just pull one at a time?
[92:40.54]I just want to fight one, not six.
[92:53.25]I gotta get this move set down, too.
[92:54.61]It's fairly awkward.
[93:05.24]There you go.
[93:07.20]Alright, get him.
[93:10.11]Please get rid of this dude.
[93:12.63]Better.
[93:13.29]Better.
[93:13.63]Better.
[93:13.85]Better.
[93:14.05]Better.
[93:14.25]Better.
[93:14.43]Better.
[93:14.61]Comb stream?
[93:15.21]I don't know.
[93:17.53]I love your videos.
[93:18.41]They always make me laugh when I am feeling down.
[93:20.43]You are so funny and keep up with the streams and good work.
[93:26.54]And that was from Katalin.
[93:28.42]Thank you, Katalin.
[93:30.18]Appreciate that.
[93:31.42]Thank you so much.
[93:33.98]Alright, how do I not pull all these people?
[93:39.20]I think I got one.
[93:44.82]Blocked it, though.
[93:48.20]Shit.
[93:49.36]Oh, my lord.
[93:50.58]Fuck.
[94:03.77]I got it that time, good.
[94:07.37]He's down.
[94:10.25]Alright, these guys were the problem.
[94:11.87]These really armored guys.
[94:13.91]Thankfully, getting them one by one is potentially a possibility.
[94:20.56]throw rocks at them.
[94:22.40]I probably should do that.
[94:24.28]I should do that.
[94:26.14]What's going on here?
[94:28.06]Prestige points, what?
[94:31.40]Uh, what?
[94:33.76]Okay.
[94:34.50]Salt.
[94:36.49]Stone.
[94:38.89]Let's equip this to here.
[94:41.05]It's already there, thank you.
[94:42.93]Alright, let's try that.
[94:47.69]Alright, that worked.
[95:00.63]Is this Dark Souls?
[95:01.31]No, this is Nioh.
[95:03.35]Nioh.
[95:05.61]Yeah.
[95:05.85]Um, yeah.
[95:06.25]I could do that.
[95:06.83]I could do that.
[95:09.11]Alright, I need another one of those.
[95:13.77]We're definitely a bunch of people here.
[95:17.11]Am I crazy or what's going on here?
[95:31.61]Oh, I hate marketing classes.
[95:35.13]Marketing 101.
[95:39.79]Marketing 107.
[95:40.21]Oh, this guy's going down.
[95:44.37]This is way better.
[95:45.17]I think I've avoided marketing classes.
[95:49.36]Pretty sure.
[95:50.34]I never took marketing classes when I was in school.
[95:53.20]In the college days.
[95:55.18]When I was a wee 25-year-old boy.
[96:01.09]Um, yeah.
[96:02.45]Kind of.
[96:03.75]Yeah, I know how to do that.
[96:07.39]Alright, let's... Can we get to a checkpoint, please?
[96:12.07]Please?
[96:12.79]It wants me to do it.
[96:13.47]You know, it told me to do it.
[96:14.39]I'm gonna do it.
[96:14.93]It, like, told me to do it.
[96:16.19]It told me to do it.
[96:19.97]It wanted to, like, teach me how to do it, so I'm gonna do it.
[96:22.01]Okay.
[96:29.42]there you go I don't smart girl you gotta use Burgah Boy technique on these guys I probably should look at this stuff um actually I do believe that there should be more people going into like stem stem
[96:59.55]Oh, this guy did that.
[97:01.81]I thought I just picked that up and my hair lit on fire.
[97:03.71]Okay.
[97:04.52]Okay.
[97:04.88]Honest to God, guy.
[97:05.70]Like, can you fuck off?
[97:07.56]You're adding to my anger.
[97:09.28]You're not taking away from it.
[97:10.40]You're adding to it.
[97:21.54]Pick that up.
[97:24.24]I'm going to strangle this guy with his own bow.
[97:32.18]How many?
[97:32.48]One?
[97:35.46]I wish I could see what this guy... Oh my fucking god, for real?
[97:38.18]Like, you're gonna do this to me?
[97:39.64]For real?
[97:43.98]No, I won't let you do that.
[97:45.14]Come on, buddy.
[97:47.40]Drop the act.
[97:50.81]Did he?
[97:54.17]Why?
[97:55.85]Why are you calling me that?
[97:57.65]And he said if I'm going to pass with you, then he's not gonna go.
[98:02.55]That's a lie.
[98:03.35]Alright, hold on.
[98:05.43]Easy, buddy.
[98:07.53]God.
[98:08.47]I'm going to brew hot tea.
[98:11.43]And just dump it on my fucking crotch.
[98:13.63]Yeah, just start a fucking teapot.
[98:15.97]And then we'll just dump it on my crotch.
[98:17.76]Like, just right off the kettle.
[98:22.38]That would be more fun than me getting my ass kicked right now.
[98:25.04]Okay.
[98:31.43]Hey, look at this.
[98:32.15]Finally.
[98:32.55]Jesus.
[98:33.37]Okay.

[98:35.93]No, I'm playing on action mode.
[98:41.46]Level up.
[98:43.00]Okay.
[98:44.78]Skill... Skill or dexterity?
[98:53.32]I'm not actually sure what to do here, so I'm gonna put...
[99:01.43]Life and resistance.
[99:03.87]We've got two.
[99:05.35]We'll do three into body.
[99:07.29]Now two.
[99:08.89]And then one into skill, one into dext.
[99:11.35]One into stamina.
[99:13.59]I think that's okay for now.
[99:14.77]Heart is key.
[99:16.99]So that's like endurance, okay?
[99:20.02]Alright, we'll do that for now.
[99:21.06]Just see how that works.
[99:23.72]Wait, little BB.
[99:24.60]Does that mean you're not a little BB like I thought you were?
[99:27.12]Little BB?
[99:27.48]Can we find him?
[99:30.60]Oh, I don't know his real name.
[99:31.66]I just know his username.
[99:33.66]But I thought Little Bebe was like a little bebe, but if he's not a little bebe, why would he be taking a marketing class?
[99:38.00]He must be a big bebe.
[99:40.78]If that's the case, I can't call him Little Bebe anymore.
[99:44.54]Should I take this blessing?
[99:45.42]100 gold?
[99:47.20]I mean, I guess you get that for sending little toad guys out?
[99:51.96]Little Bebe, you know who you are!

[108:04.28]Just don't give it out.
[108:05.94]Oh no, because I'm still like working on it right now.
[108:09.30]True, true.
[108:11.56]I feel like I'm... Drinking whiskey was probably a bad idea.
[108:16.96]Because I just have no fucking idea where I'm going.
[108:21.29]Can I have a slice of the cake?
[108:24.35]Of course you can!
[108:26.02]Since you did so well on your presentation, you can come over and help them.

[119:17.05]Use the salt on the frog demon thing.
[119:18.80]Also play Earthbound.
[119:21.92]Earthbound is a fantastic game, but I'm not sure that's a good stream game.
[119:27.24]I'm not sure that's a game I would like to stream.
[119:28.66]Just because it's very slow and there's a lot of dialog.
[119:33.79]Cupcake9, just reset for two months, and Von Musen, just subscribed.
[119:39.56]Hi, thank you.

[120:20.40]That was worth at least 20 Jerem of Mothra.
[120:21.96]Like, honest to God, this is the fucking hardest.
[120:24.48]This is way harder than Dark Souls.
[120:26.98]Like, you don't get hit by one guy and get stuck in a combo and die from full health in Dark Souls.
[120:32.84]Like, what in the name of fucking God is going on here?
[120:35.90]Give me a fucking break.
[120:37.22]What the fuck?

[120:46.42]Like, holy fuck, man.
[120:52.12]Oh, Tag.
[120:52.58]Hey, what's going on, Tag?
[120:53.91]Hi.
[120:57.79]Stop playing it like Dark Souls.
[120:59.07]I can't help it.
[120:59.69]It is like Dark Souls, so I have to play it like Dark Souls.
[121:03.25]Until I get rid of those bad habits.
[121:06.02]How short am I?
[121:07.66]I am 5 feet.
[121:15.16]How many Jerma videos have I watched?
[121:16.70]I have watched zero.
[121:18.70]She doesn't watch my videos.
[121:31.11]But no, Tag is a good dude.
[121:32.27]What's going on, Tag?
[121:32.85]Hi, Tag.
[121:33.95]Tag, have you played this game yet?
[121:35.88]And if you have, how angry did you get?
[121:39.37]On the scale of one to angry.
[121:40.69]Kim, tell us Tad's name.
[121:42.09]I do not know his name because Jeremy doesn't really talk about him that much.
[121:46.96]I don't know if he talks about anybody.
[121:48.66]I wish I had... Oh, I do have that right.
[121:53.62]No, we ain't gonna even go over there.
[121:57.04]Fuck it.
[121:57.30]I'm just gonna shoot him again.
[121:58.33]I don't wanna aggro anybody.
[122:01.03]I am a fake fan.
[122:07.03]I'm not a fan of Jeremy.
[122:11.48]So you don't have to call me a big fan because I'm not a big fan.
[122:15.20]What are you doing here?
[122:16.71]What are you doing here?
[122:18.27]Not a fan of me?
[122:19.55]Now I'm going to die because you just said that.
[122:21.27]You just threw me off so bad.
[122:22.79]Then I'm going to fucking lose.
[122:24.73]I can't even get to the frog demon again.
[122:36.56]I'm not a fan.
[122:37.64]I'm not a fan.
[122:38.42]I'm not a fan of this guy.
[122:39.53]I'm just over his house right now.
[122:42.15]I'm just over his fucking house right now.
[122:44.23]You gotta lean into the microphone when you have to make a point.
[122:53.98]What point are you going to make?
[122:56.58]Are you making this point?
[122:57.34]You can't do that right now.
[122:59.29]I'm trying to play a video game.
[123:01.87]I'm not sure if you understand the gravity of the situation here.
[123:06.39]Oh my god.
[123:07.07]I'm going to die.
[123:08.33]I'm dead.
[123:09.23]I'm dead.
[123:10.85]I'm dead.
[123:11.37]I'm dead.
[123:12.12]I'm dead.
[123:14.02]She's killed me.
[123:21.76]That was not my fault.
[123:24.34]That's not my fault.
[123:24.98]It's not... It is not my fault.
[123:28.80]You fucking suck, dude.
[123:30.50]Oh, it's not my fault that I suck at this game.
[123:32.34]You just, like, you just, like, grabbed my face and, like, pulled me forward.
[123:35.32]Oh my god.
[123:35.98]I'm fucking dead.
[123:38.66]I'm gonna die again.
[123:39.26]Yeah, she's walking in front of the TV!
[123:41.48]She's walking in front of the fucking TV.
[123:43.17]Wait, what did I do?
[123:47.15]Nothing.
[123:48.57]You walked in front of the TV and I got hit.
[123:54.73]Oh my god, am I ever gonna get past this fucking point in the game?
[123:59.86]I just want to get past the frog demon.
[124:02.18]I just want to get past this.
[124:05.10]I've been sabotaged.
[124:06.56]This is not fair.
[124:08.33]It ain't fair.
[124:16.91]Otto.
[124:18.05]Otto, what the heck, man?
[124:25.50]Oh god, I fucking died again.
[124:30.25]Oh my god.
[124:31.95]This is like... This is like, holy fuck.
[124:35.27]Well, maybe you shouldn't be drinking while you're trying to play this game.
[124:38.09]No, I'm gonna get past this, I promise.
[124:42.44]I don't care how many fucking whiskeys I've had.
[124:46.05]Fuck your demon face.
[124:47.03]I don't even want to fight this guy.
[124:48.31]Of course, I say fuck this guy and he's still here.
[124:50.41]I had to even dodge too and I didn't...
[125:10.01]Past the whiskey.
[125:11.32]Look, there's nothing else for us to do.
[125:12.28]We're snowed in.
[125:13.02]There's like 14 inches of snow on the ground.
[125:15.26]We can't even go anywhere.
[125:16.14]We can't even leave my house.
[125:18.04]Sixth planet, resubscribe for five months.
[125:20.58]Game sucks.
[125:21.56]Yeah, it does.
[125:22.24]No, no, game doesn't suck.
[125:23.25]Game doesn't suck.
[125:23.81]I just, I need to, I'm just drinking.
[125:25.79]Wait.
[125:26.09]You know what?
[125:28.17]I actually know someone working on this game.
[125:29.49]Oh my fucking god.
[125:33.13]This is outrageously, awfully hard.
[125:36.16]Toasted cats, just resub for three months.
[125:37.92]Thank you.
[125:39.90]Confluffle?
[125:41.72]Confucking?
[125:42.56]Will you subscribe?
[125:43.72]Or just subscribe?
[125:45.26]NuclearPanana?
[125:46.65]Just subscribe?
[125:48.79]And a new map?
[125:52.97]Thanks, dude.
[125:58.59]I'm currently trying to pay attention to the fact that getting hit in one combo means you're guaranteed to lose in this game.
[126:04.77]If you get touched by one person's weapon, you're guaranteed to die.
[126:08.05]Okay.
[126:20.04]Stop getting close?
[126:21.08]I have to.
[126:21.96]I'm going this way.
[126:28.41]Fuck that way.
[126:30.25]Oh, little BB's in the room.
[126:31.73]Found him.
[126:32.89]Found him in the chat.
[126:40.84]Well, that's fine.
[126:42.28]Tell him to drink like half a bottle of whiskey and play L.A.
[126:45.50]Noire and see how he does.
[126:49.56]I'm gonna slow down.
[126:57.42]This isn't Dark Souls.
[126:58.28]This game is not Dark Souls.
[126:59.38]Stop playing it like Dark Souls.
[127:02.82]That was mean.
[127:03.32]That was mean.
[127:05.86]It was.
[127:10.15]Well, Fu just gave you 100 bits again and asked the same question that he did.
[127:14.79]What is it?
[127:16.33]If you did choose to fight 100 duck-sized horses over Jeremy in a diaper, would the horses still be taller than him?
[127:27.30]I would not fight the duck-sized horses.
[127:29.38]I would fight Jeremy.
[127:30.98]And no, they would not.
[127:40.45]They all come.
[127:41.01]They all come.
[127:41.83]They all come.
[127:43.15]They all come.
[127:44.84]All of them.
[127:45.96]They all come.
[127:47.50]What?
[127:50.06]Get me over this way.
[127:51.18]Thanks, dude.
[127:54.72]Actually, the more that I drank, the more that I think I'm getting better at this game.
[128:06.21]Hey, no.
[128:06.69]It's alright.
[128:08.31]I got a guy right here.
[128:14.19]Shit's going okay.
[128:17.41]Shit's going good.
[128:18.77]Just gotta get good.
[128:19.89]That's all it came down to.
[128:20.60]Oh, okay.
[128:25.08]I read it.
[128:26.48]I put my face down to the chat and I got hit three times.
[128:39.91]Alright, we're good.
[128:40.58]We're good.
[128:40.96]I finally fucking got out of that dog shit of an area.
[128:46.78]Jesus.
[128:49.68]Discord?
[128:51.36]Okay.
[128:52.82]Frog guy.
[128:54.18]Don't get one hit by frog guy.
[128:58.33]Alright, what does this do?
[129:00.53]Assault.
[129:00.95]Is that a shortcut?
[129:08.29]Alright, I'm gonna put this on.
[129:10.72]Is this gonna hurt this guy, his shitload or something?
[129:12.52]I don't understand.
[129:13.58]Let's try it.
[129:15.28]Where is he?
[129:15.58]That didn't do anything.
[129:19.67]What did that do?
[129:20.33]I don't know.
[129:22.73]Get out of the fucking house.
[129:28.97]Play this smart and beat this guy.
[129:31.47]Be smart about it.
[129:32.29]I don't want to get in too close.
[129:44.01]What the fuck was that?
[129:44.83]I dodged.
[129:45.95]I fucking dodged into it?
[129:48.47]What?
[129:52.32]Alright.
[129:53.10]Oh my god.
[129:55.74]What?
[129:56.08]I don't... Okay.
[129:57.80]I didn't even know what that fucking did.
[129:58.86]Get on the ground.
[130:07.61]Easy, easy, easy.
[130:12.46]Oh my god damn, man!
[130:14.82]It's so hard to dodge around this guy when he's fucking that big.
[130:19.64]I didn't know the salt, like, you blow it like fucking like a WWF character.
[130:29.26]What am I, like Ric Flair blowing like fucking talcum powder in the guy's face?
[130:32.95]Give me a fucking rig.
[130:37.79]Come over here.
[130:39.25]Asshole.
[130:42.37]He's running out of steam.
[130:45.59]He's out of steam.
[130:49.53]Don't get stuck in a fucking house with this idiot.
[131:00.79]Get me out.
[131:04.94]Not much, come on.
[131:05.88]Little BB, what's your name?
[131:09.04]Type it in the Discord.
[131:16.77]Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
[131:20.31]Ho-ho-ho!
[131:21.39]That was fucking close!
[131:27.30]Runnin' a juice.
[131:31.32]Play it smart.
[131:34.56]Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.
[131:44.32]Here we go!
[131:47.30]Oh god, fuck.
[131:53.13]Oh god, fuck.
[131:53.55]We gotta hit him one time with a big overhand swing, and he's gonna die, right?
[131:56.55]Right?
[131:57.83]Right?
[131:59.01]Right?
[131:59.99]Here we go!
[132:04.97]Got him.
[132:05.31]Way!
[132:09.29]That guy was easy.
[132:14.20]I, like, Luke, I am too lazy to type, and I am talking through the Discord.
[132:18.39]Sorry.
[132:20.63]Okay, that guy was easy.
[132:23.25]What an easy guy.
[132:27.29]Key to residence.
[132:30.15]Aw, I like that name.
[132:32.01]Thanks, little BB.
[132:37.06]Key to residence, whatever that means, okay.
[132:39.86]Let's keep going.
[132:42.14]Still gonna call you little BB, but it's just nice to know who I'm talking to.
[132:46.46]Uh, key to residence.
[132:47.24]Okay.
[132:50.25]Let's check around the area, make sure I didn't miss anything.
[132:59.33]Armor... Oh, you're gonna spawn a guy right there, aren't you?
[133:02.48]Okay.
[133:10.01]I could probably level up at this point.
[133:11.85]Ooh, big chest.
[133:12.65]Alright, let's take a look.
[133:24.56]Uh, Uchi Katana.
[133:27.78]I want, oh, there we go, there's a new one.
[133:29.54]Is this better?
[133:30.82]No.
[133:32.42]Not at all.
[133:34.04]It's worse, how the fuck is it worse?
[133:39.00]How could this be worse?
[133:41.42]7.1, 8.7.
[133:41.60]Maybe it is better.
[133:44.84]I guess I'll put it on.
[133:49.08]Might as well, right?
[133:53.50]Warlord armor.
[133:55.00]Oh, now I'm starting to look kind of cool.
[134:07.48]You look like a bitch.
[134:09.20]What?
[134:09.44]I look like fucking Shredder from Ninja Turtles.
[134:12.33]Shredder from Ninja Turtles was fucking awesome.
[134:19.21]Young BB.
[134:45.51]I think I gotta go this way.
[134:46.47]Hopefully there's a shrine.
[134:53.57]No, let's go.
[134:55.72]There's something right here, though.
[134:56.96]Whatever it is.
[134:57.76]I can't see it.
[134:59.04]Oh, there it is.
[135:04.36]Oh, there's a little guy.
[135:10.50]See you later, little guy.
[135:16.08]Use the dual swords.
[135:18.26]If I still have trouble with this, which I probably will, I'm gonna have to bring up the dual swords.
[135:24.72]Let's keep going.
[135:32.24]Birds.
[135:33.40]Cool.
[135:34.58]Dual swords and inventory.
[135:35.76]Dual swords and inventory.
[135:36.62]Was it really?
[135:39.26]I didn't even see.
[135:39.84]I'm sorry, guys.
[135:43.18]Dual swords.
[135:46.11]Uchigatana.
[135:48.13]Where are they?
[135:49.37]Ah, these.
[135:53.37]Okay.
[135:53.95]61 or 42.
[135:57.41]I'll try them.
[135:59.23]We're going to try dual swords.
[136:02.15]Ooh, nice.
[136:06.79]We'll give him a go for a little bit.
[136:08.47]See if I like him any better.
[136:13.14]Kim doing work, or what did she do?
[136:14.54]I didn't do anything, Bibi.
[136:16.66]Kim doing work?
[136:17.54]I don't even know what that means.
[136:23.15]I don't have any arrows.
[136:25.53]Oh, thank god, a shrine.
[136:28.77]Hey, Ronnie.
[136:31.11]Whomp Ronnie.
[136:32.89]Ronnie's a good dude.
[136:33.59]Everybody say hi to Ronnie.
[136:35.39]16 months.
[136:35.59]Thanks a lot, man.
[136:37.81]Whompcomic.com.
[136:39.53]Good shit.
[136:40.38]He's a good dude.
[136:42.18]I can level up once.
[136:45.28]Should I be leveling skill or dexterity?
[136:48.38]Which one of those actually adds attack power to my weapons?
[136:56.52]Is dexterity better for the weapons I have, or is skill better for the weapons I have?
[137:09.14]Magic, both.
[137:10.76]Skill.
[137:15.11]Skill for the dual swords.
[137:16.09]I don't know what I want to use.
[137:22.67]Heart.
[137:22.99]I don't know.
[137:26.79]What does heart do?
[137:27.51]That's key.
[137:28.15]I'll put one into heart.
[137:32.18]I can see the blue numbers.
[137:33.00]Yeah, I know.
[137:33.46]I just didn't... Equipment max.
[137:36.80]So that's... Attack melee, one.
[137:40.28]Skill adds two.
[137:41.16]Okay.
[137:44.04]Level heart?
[137:44.60]Should I level heart?
[137:46.19]Maybe?
[137:51.67]The Kusarigama scales with deck skill and body.
[137:55.01]Well, I want more health.
[137:55.96]I'm gonna put one in body.
[137:56.64]I'll be okay.
[138:00.64]Now, what about... Boons?
[138:07.10]No, it's a DLC.
[138:09.16]Kodama.
[138:09.92]Change guardian level up.
[138:11.04]Make offering.
[138:15.71]Oh, this is how you sell shit.
[138:17.01]Okay, cool.
[138:20.23]This is how you sell.
[138:21.53]Got it.
[138:22.13]Nice.
[138:25.78]What are you writing?
[138:26.76]What are you doing in here?
[138:29.38]What are you writing in the disco?
[138:30.56]You know, I can go back and look.
[138:31.74]I got the logs, you know.
[138:32.79]Yeah, I know you do.
[138:33.79]I can see what you're writing.
[138:41.91]Yeah, whatever.
[138:46.40]Do I have enough?
[138:50.96]No.
[138:51.14]It's like triangle.
[138:53.90]Oh, okay.
[138:56.06]How did I level up my weapons before?
[138:58.02]Wasn't there a way to do that?
[139:00.76]I guess not.
[139:03.87]Logs, I say.
[139:04.65]Alright, I got a feeling I'm getting close to the first real boss of the game.
[139:10.03]So, let's see.
[139:10.75]Let's try out our new weapons.
[139:15.57]I mean, they're good.
[139:23.63]They're actually pretty good.
[139:24.49]Let's try the powerful stance.
[139:32.22]Yeah, I mean, they're... They're good.
[139:35.53]Whoa, hey!
[139:36.73]BB88KingWild for 10 bucks.
[139:39.41]Thanks a lot, dude.
[139:40.21]BBGermaEarth.
[139:40.95]Thanks a lot, man.
[139:42.63]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[139:44.91]You wonderful, wonderful person.
[139:47.29]I'm your favorite doggo?
[139:48.39]Well, that's cool.
[139:49.63]Hi.
[139:52.01]I'm glad to be your favorite doggo.
[140:01.11]I gotta keep remembering to activate that shit.
[140:07.18]Oh, it's a BB imposter.
[140:10.50]Oh, there's another one of these guys.
[140:11.50]That's cool.
[140:14.56]And I didn't get him with that.
[140:17.22]I thought these guys are fucking vulnerable to that.
[140:24.08]What?
[140:24.96]What is the, the, the super power?
[140:26.95]I'm curious.
[140:28.89]Let's see what it does.
[140:37.57]Ooh, that was painful.
[140:39.85]That was painful too.
[140:47.97]He's dead.
[140:52.64]Okay.
[140:53.40]That gave me a lot of souls.
[140:54.48]Who is it?
[141:00.29]Who is it?
[141:00.61]Who is it?
[141:01.09]I see somebody's here.
[141:03.79]Hello?
[141:07.27]No.
[141:07.91]Ow.
[141:08.55]Ow.
[141:12.88]You don't block, so why use the mid stance?
[141:14.40]You should use the overhead stance.
[141:16.34]I've been using the overhead stance a lot, actually.
[141:32.39]Shit.
[141:34.33]I don't like these guys.
[141:38.35]Well, he's almost out of stamina, but so am I.
[141:46.97]Right in the gut!
[141:48.50]Split him in half.
[141:50.22]Except there's one asshole up there still using Q. Damn, my life, dude.
[141:56.90]For real.
[142:02.97]I don't know why these guys give me this much trouble.
[142:16.43]Wish I had arrows.
[142:19.15]But I don't.
[142:25.26]Whetstone.
[142:26.34]That's interesting.
[142:31.94]You guys are obsessed with Jupiter today?
[142:36.58]Jerma just eat the cake, you have to study for math?
[142:38.41]No, I gotta get to the first boss.
[142:41.12]Oh my fuck.
[142:45.10]That sucks.
[142:54.55]Earn one skill point.
[142:55.61]Okay.
[142:55.73]Let's put it in.
[143:00.81]Dual swords.
[143:02.43]Quick draw attack.
[143:03.17]Can only be used when your sword is sheathed or follows up a combo with a roundhouse kick.
[143:11.89]Huh.
[143:12.99]Um.
[143:14.78]Kind of like that.
[143:18.18]What about the other one?
[143:22.74]Activates when you recover full from a ki pulse.
[143:25.41]Kicks the enemy.
[143:27.45]Square while guarding.
[143:28.27]Let's get that.
[143:31.05]Slashes the enemy with the Kusaguri Sickle.
[143:33.11]L1 plus triangle while guarding.
[143:35.08]Let's get it.
[143:38.10]R1 for circle increases your attack, but also the amount of key damage you receive.
[143:40.88]And it'll be used when you're skedded.
[143:43.70]Fuck it.
[143:43.92]Alright.
[143:44.10]Might as well.
[143:46.67]So now, what did I get with this?
[143:47.59]A quick draw attack?
[143:49.25]Something like that?
[143:52.53]Oh, I'm a cutie?
[143:53.29]Well, thank you, Squiggity Stag.
[143:54.47]Appreciate it, dude.
[143:56.20]Thanks!
[143:56.96]You are a cutie.
[143:58.42]Oh, I just fell down.
[143:59.14]There's a guy in here.
[144:00.18]Okay.
[144:09.69]I thought he was gonna swing.
[144:13.59]Aye yi yi.
[144:14.79]Aye yi yi.
[144:15.19]This one random dickhead was very close.
[144:23.71]I gotta be getting close.
[144:26.33]Am I close to the fir- There's another one of those scary demons right here.
[144:29.31]You know how I can tell?
[144:29.99]Because I can see the fucking mirage.
[144:34.13]Should I be avoiding those?
[144:35.13]These guys are fucking hard.
[144:38.13]I don't know.
[144:39.07]Whatever.
[144:39.39]Fucking let's go, buddy.
[144:40.33]I'm trying to shoot him in the head.
[144:43.28]That'll be cute.
[145:00.56]Oh my lord, that's fucking so much damage.
[145:05.26]Um, you know, I, you know, fuck this.
[145:07.12]These guys are fucking unbearable.
[145:08.74]Like, get the fuck away from me.
[145:10.98]Eat my fucking ass, seriously.
[145:16.47]No, it's just, fuck those guys.
[145:19.89]Fuck those guys, for real.
[145:21.19]Fuck those enemies.
[145:23.19]They take forever to fucking kill.
[145:26.47]No, it's because they take forever to kill.
[145:29.04]They take, like, fucking five minutes to kill.
[145:31.00]And I just got... I'm getting eaten.
[145:31.96]I'm gonna get my face bit off and it's over.
[145:33.16]This gets thrown up on me.
[145:35.12]Okay, I'm poisoned.
[145:36.10]It's over.
[145:39.06]I'm dead.
[145:39.58]Like, those fucking enemies are so fucking stupid.
[145:42.99]My god.
[145:53.21]I'm just running by all this shit.
[145:54.63]Like, seriously, fuck this.
[146:00.29]I'm fighting enemies that are gonna breathe salt in their face.
[146:04.61]And I'm like, whoa, cool.
[146:12.59]You can tell that fucking FromSoftware had nothing to do with this game.
[146:20.94]I just, like, might as well die here.
[146:22.98]This is fucking so stupid.
[146:24.80]BB.
[146:27.42]Thank you for the bits.
[146:29.04]I'm just going to... I'm dead.
[146:31.16]I'm just going to intentionally fucking die.
[146:33.02]Thanks guys.
[146:33.50]Dead again.
[146:33.78]Yeah, dead again.
[146:51.11]Dead again.
[146:51.63]And you know what?
[146:53.97]I'm gonna be honest.
[146:55.11]Fuck that weapon.
[146:56.23]I like this thing much better.
[147:00.35]I'm a fan of this thing more than I am the Dual Swords.
[147:02.18]As much as I don't necessarily... Actually, this thing is better.
[147:05.78]I like it.
[147:09.36]You can really just tell that Frop software had nothing to do with this fucking release.
[147:12.60]You know what I'm saying?
[147:19.56]Really?
[147:21.85]Lost my 3,000 souls.
[147:22.87]Yeah, that's the way it is.
[147:24.01]That's the way it is when you're dealing with invisible fuckfaces that jump out and have like 5,000 health.
[147:29.37]Whoo!
[147:54.06]Got a TTS bot?
[147:55.22]What's a TTS bot?
[148:03.35]Arrows, arrows, arrows, arrows.
[148:04.61]No, no, no.
[148:10.41]Jeremy is salted.
[148:11.39]I mean, kinda.
[148:14.03]It's like... Did I get this mad at Dark Souls 3?
[148:18.96]I don't think I did.
[148:20.48]No, that's not true.
[148:21.38]I did.
[148:22.88]But I could... Don't fall down there.
[148:24.94]I could appreciate it.
[148:27.40]I could appreciate that shit.
[148:31.28]And I don't appreciate falling down.
[148:33.82]Actually, I do.
[148:34.82]Okay.
[148:36.25]Jump with the dog person.
[148:39.19]Okay.
[149:01.13]Please just fucking my god.
[149:02.85]I'm getting to the point where I'm gonna go bury my face in the snow like an ostrich.
[149:08.49]I'm gonna go bury my face in the snow like a fucking ostrich.
[149:14.92]God damn, man.
[149:18.46]This game gonna be on stream from now on?
[149:23.60]She's around.
[149:24.98]Whenever she's around, she should be happy to be on stream.
[149:28.94]Oh, look, another one of those fucking misty assholes that I don't want to fight.
[149:33.58]I'm going to avoid this guy.
[149:34.62]Fuck this guy.
[149:35.40]Get out of here.
[149:38.28]Can I go around him?
[149:39.02]I don't want to fight this fucking guy.
[149:52.73]Don't do it.
[149:53.61]Don't do it.
[149:58.24]A clown?
[149:59.90]Just wait until I get my clown car.
[150:01.08]It's gonna be perfect.
[150:05.85]Record me sticking my head in the snow?
[150:10.29]Kind of funny actually.
[150:10.91]Alright, now what am I supposed to do?
[150:18.56]Just keep going around I guess?
[150:21.38]This way?
[150:26.85]I guess so, I don't know.
[150:44.22]Can I do something down here that I missed, maybe?
[150:48.20]And if you step in the... If the fire... The fire is not just a decoration.
[150:54.43]Fire's not a decoration.
[150:57.13]Fucking fire's not a decoration.
[151:00.26]You gotta get it off me.
[151:10.39]Spirit stone.
[151:24.03]Should I just... That was a mistake.
[151:31.19]That was a big mistake.
[151:34.55]That was such a mistake.
[151:36.24]And there's more fire.
[151:37.16]Fuck.
[151:38.34]God damn it.
[151:40.56]Give me a healing potion, please.
[151:42.10]Fuck.
[151:42.32]I'm so screwed.
[151:42.92]What was I thinking?
[151:51.84]Do I have any more healing?
[151:52.80]I don't think so.
[151:55.16]Travel amulet.
[152:01.09]Shit.
[152:01.23]I just gotta get to the boat.
[152:09.13]That's all it is, guys.
[152:09.79]Get to the boat, and we're good.
[152:12.23]Don't touch anything.

[152:53.35]Star got to the second boss.
[152:54.49]We're not talking about Star right now, we're talking about you.
[152:56.75]After like six, seven hours, so it's all, I'm fine.
[153:00.55]FromSoftware obviously had nothing to fucking do with this game.
[153:03.96]Just kill me.
[153:04.44]Aye, aye, aye.
[153:16.00]I fucking swear to God.

[153:33.15]You heard it.
[153:34.29]You heard me say it.
[153:35.61]You can clip that shit and put it on Dark Souls Reddit.
[153:44.14]You know what?
[153:44.56]Fuck it.

[154:34.48]I told you, I have to get to the first boss.
[154:37.49]And we're fucking going to do this again.
[154:41.19]Alright.
[154:42.61]Realistically, you guys remember when I did that with 30% health?
[154:45.67]Yeah, I'm trying to run through the bar.
[154:49.75]When I did that with 30% health, why was that possible?
[154:53.76]But with full health, I can't do it.
[154:57.64]Did I, like, bug the game out the first time I did that or what?
[155:03.22]Oh, yeah.
[155:03.90]Oh, salt is flowing through my veins right now.
[155:07.84]I'd rather you pee on me and, like, let me play Dark Souls 3.

[155:38.11]Dens is a talented swordsman.
[155:53.71]I was wet in the game.
[156:00.04]The game gets harder every time you die?
[156:01.34]That's not true, is it?
[156:02.74]I hope not.
[156:03.20]That would be fucking terrible.
[156:04.12]Yeah, because you would never win.
[156:06.08]I would never beat this game.
[156:26.23]Ever get out of my face Don't fall down another hole just get to where I need to go To go this way and up and around don't fight the demon.
