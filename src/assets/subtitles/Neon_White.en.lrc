[ve:60.16.100]

[00:18.34]I am back.
[00:24.05]So this is a fast-paced, moving shooter.
[00:26.75]This is not a controller game, right?
[00:33.05]What about Viewfinder?
[00:33.89]Yeah, that's true.
[00:42.04]Yeah, that's true.
[00:42.66]I already got it open, though.
[00:48.24]It's a guggity game.
[00:52.49]I I like guggity games.
[01:00.46]Alright, let me make sure this is good to go.
[01:04.22]Should be.
[01:04.68]Capture this.
[01:16.79]I need to capture a game.
[01:18.49]I would like to capture a game that would be great.
[01:25.84]How high should my sensitivity be?
[01:27.04]Alright, looks good.
[01:43.12]Let's go.
[01:47.14]Is there a cutscene?
[01:48.66]Probably.
[01:52.35]Did I just skip the cutscene?
[01:55.03]I didn't mean to.
[01:55.51]Should have known it was going to end this way.
[01:59.63]Did I skip the cutscene?
[02:02.15]God's sick sense of humor or something.
[02:07.13]People like me don't get second chances.
[02:10.00]But if I did.
[02:14.55]I can't believe there are 10 Winnie the Pooh movies.
[02:16.36]I'm so mad about that because I've never won the million in that game.
[02:20.08]I'm just never gonna be allowed to.
[02:21.32]I'm just never gonna be allowed to get it.
[02:23.04]That's fine.
[02:28.50]I shook my head the whole time I was peeing.
[02:30.47]There's no way.
[02:31.27]Huh?
[02:34.43]I swear I was just in the middle of something.
[02:37.21]Can't remember a thing though.
[02:39.37]Where the heck am I?
[02:40.63]Do I know these people?
[02:48.73]That's what's gonna happen in about five seconds.
[02:50.41]What?
[02:51.63]Oh, can one of the mods change the title?
[02:55.84]Because that does not make sense for Neon White.
[03:10.46]And you dead mortals are what we refer to as neons, sinners, the goddess judged most unfavorably.
[03:19.08]Okay.
[03:20.53]Wait, am I meant to be in hell?
[03:24.27]But fret not, for we have granted you an opportunity for salvation in our annual competition, the Ten Days of Judgment.
[03:32.56]Keep it.
[03:36.28]During these ten days, you Neons will use your villainous talents to annihilate the demons invading our holy land.
[03:45.10]Okay.
[03:47.02]I think I can handle that.
[03:48.56]This is for real.
[03:50.68]Hey, guess what?
[03:51.87]You died and God thinks you suck.
[03:54.03]Go kill some crap?
[03:56.59]That's me.
[03:56.93]That's me.
[04:00.03]You will each receive a soul card containing a weapon within your past.
[04:03.19]I'm that character.
[04:03.69]I'm that character.
[04:12.44]Tana Soulcard.
[04:13.72]Soulcard with a melee slash attack.
[04:16.90]It cannot be discarded.
[04:18.80]The attached note reads, according to our records, White's ideal weapon is a totally sick samurai sword.
[04:26.11]The most competent demon slayer will receive the ultimate reward.
[04:29.91]That's me, that's me.
[04:30.83]God's forgiveness in your very own place in heaven.
[04:35.30]What the fuck?
[04:35.66]No, I want to be that character.
[04:36.64]That's not like you at all.
[04:37.68]You don't even act like that.
[04:39.44]Yeah, I do.
[04:39.74]That's me.
[04:40.48]You can be the other one.
[04:41.10]You can be this boss character or something.
[04:46.98]But first, some housekeeping.
[04:57.00]That's me.
[05:09.89]You will now be known as Neon White.
[05:15.34]Do not forget, you are here in heaven as guests.
[05:19.94]These masks contain an explosive that we won't hesitate to detonate if you step out of line.
[05:30.23]Can I get some Gagadah, please?
[05:31.53]Refrain from removing them.
[05:33.79]Unless, of course, you'd prefer to go out in flames.
[05:44.12]Yeesh.
[05:45.10]I guess lowly sinners shouldn't expect red carpet treatment.
[05:48.50]But heaven kind of seems like a racket.
[05:52.20]And yet, forgiveness is strangely compelling to me.
[05:57.42]Like every inch of my body is calling out for it.
[06:00.62]It's almost painful.
[06:02.26]Voice act along.
[06:03.08]That's what we're doing.
[06:04.36]Who exactly did I used to be?
[06:07.89]Love tutorials.
[06:34.76]Okay, movement.
[06:37.44]Sure.
[06:40.34]W-S-A-D.
[06:42.79]It's W-A-S-D.
[06:46.25]Excuse me.
[06:49.05]Way, way, way too hard.
[06:51.73]Way too hard.
[06:55.13]I'm going to go with 30.
[06:56.81]And then... How's the FOV?
[06:59.01]Should I be 100?
[07:00.61]100 too much is 95, all right.
[07:03.24]Find out.
[07:07.93]It's a little too low.
[07:10.39]Looks really cool.
[07:11.07]I feel like .40.
[07:12.47]Okay, what am I looking at here?
[07:18.81]Is there a double jump?
[07:22.79]There's a glide.
[07:23.71]Oh, this is very pretty.
[07:25.37]I have ammo for this.
[07:32.48]Oh.
[07:37.20]Now what?
[07:38.56]Oh, you can walk in this.
[07:44.68]Jumping.
[07:49.63]Is there bunny hopping?
[07:50.51]Is there bee hopping?
[07:54.13]Not really.
[08:02.07]Music's too loud.
[08:04.73]I got you.
[08:06.09]I got you.
[08:18.05]It's all right.
[08:19.39]I think that's a little bit better.
[08:33.84]You did it.
[08:35.28]You got a bronze medal.
[08:36.85]Bronze medal unlocked inside level one.
[08:39.49]Unlocked for this level, gifts findable.
[08:47.05]Okay, fight.
[08:51.59]Press restart.
[08:52.85]Wait, you can just click restart?
[08:54.41]Okay, that's a quick restart.
[08:58.72]There are seven demons.
[09:07.58]Terrify.
[09:08.09]This card fires like a machine gun.
[09:13.23]Ooh.
[09:15.75]Swap cards with Q. I think I want to change that to a different button, but start like this.
[09:19.77]Is there a sprint or anything or am I just always sprinting?
[09:28.92]Go.
[09:29.84]What's next?
[09:32.93]Did I level 2?
[09:38.51]Nice TF2 aim.
[09:40.71]Was that an insult?
[09:50.06]Okay, I get it.
[10:03.53]That's pretty fast.
[10:05.23]I'll take it.
[10:18.18]Your voice is annoying.
[10:19.10]You should mute your mic.
[10:19.80]You're annoying.
[10:20.22]How's that sound?
[10:21.38]Neon yellow.
[10:34.10]This guy.
[10:35.48]Even with a mask on, I recognize him from earlier.
[10:38.10]I tell I know him, but just vaguely.
[10:42.36]That's me.
[10:43.12]Holy crap, you got the freaking anime sword?
[10:45.73]I thought for sure you'd get one of those little guns like the, uh... Oh, shit, I have to turn the page.
[10:52.93]Sorry, everyone's waiting.
[10:54.01]What's it called?
[10:54.53]Like gnomes use?
[10:58.14]Uh, gnomes?
[11:02.25]Just messing, just messing.
[11:04.17]I know you're a badass.
[11:06.45]Why the hell does an idiot like this seem to remember me perfectly?
[11:12.73]I'm not going to skip all the dialogue.
[11:14.49]What?
[11:14.87]No.
[11:15.19]I want to know what's going on.
[11:16.73]You okay, man?
[11:18.69]No.
[11:19.33]What?
[11:19.74]For real?
[11:20.80]We rode together for years, bro.
[11:22.60]Got off to some crazy stuff.
[11:25.62]You're my sass game, man.
[11:27.40]The darkness to my light.
[11:29.12]You know I saved your life once.
[11:30.82]Took a bullet for you, dude.
[11:32.84]Really?
[11:33.18]Nah, I'm just messing.
[11:39.12]I'm not skipping any- I'm not skipping anything.
[11:41.82]Shh.
[11:43.24]Shh.
[11:44.56]Yeah.
[11:45.08]Shh.
[11:45.20]Alright.
[11:47.47]But seriously, dude.
[11:48.55]We should team up.
[11:49.73]Just like old times.
[11:52.18]Then I can save you for real from those, like, demon freaks or something.
[11:56.40]Yeah, um, appreciate the offer, but no thanks.
[12:00.63]I work alone.
[12:01.61]Don't shush me.
[12:04.27]Don't tweet at me.
[12:04.85]Don't shush me.
[12:05.73]I could be like, pow, and you could be like... Like my favorite line from a TV show.
[12:12.51]It could be one of my favorite lines.
[12:16.13]Don't shush me.
[12:16.65]Don't tweet me.
[12:18.84]There's so much going on in that sentence.
[12:21.00]I love it.
[12:26.08]Sure, good meeting you.
[12:29.64]Don't think feel bro.
[12:33.56]Let's go.
[12:35.80]This is a pistol.
[12:39.53]Discard ability.
[12:41.77]Here's a second jump right midair.
[12:45.79]How do I discard a card?
[12:48.97]Oh.
[12:51.93]OK.
[12:53.61]Can I have another one of those?
[13:07.07]Do I only have to have one bullet for it to work?
[13:09.76]Oh, I see.
[13:10.22]Okay, you have to collect them.
[13:11.42]Whoa, that's... Okay.
[13:14.28]I get it now.
[13:26.91]Cool.
[13:28.61]Cleared it.
[13:29.27]Oh shit, he's playing a real game.
[13:32.43]It's a good... Yeah.
[13:40.97]Is this as fast as I can go?
[13:55.46]I'm assuming yes.
[14:01.62]No.
[14:04.94]I can go even faster than that.
[14:06.18]Technically, no.
[14:06.96]Not even close.
[14:10.94]Rank up.
[14:21.67]I unironically like this game.
[14:23.03]I mean, the game seems fun.
[14:26.17]Jump on a balloon demon to kill it and bounce into the air.
[14:36.28]And with a double jump, that would be pretty cool.
[14:48.31]Oh, I blew it.
[14:55.14]Here we go.
[15:07.11]I gotta save this.
[15:25.45]Oh, there's still a demon left.
[15:26.99]Oh, shit.
[15:27.67]Okay, hold on.
[15:30.19]I need to... I don't like Q being the button to press.
[15:52.45]Oh, a little too.
[15:53.11]All right, all right.
[15:53.85]This game's fun.
[15:55.19]Oh, just one more try.
[15:56.39]Just one more try.
[15:57.41]It really hits you with that one more try.
[16:26.19]There we go.
[16:28.81]Yeah.
[16:29.53]Gold medal.
[16:30.43]Gold medal.
[16:31.33]Yeah.
[16:31.79]Yeah.
[16:32.25]Yeah.
[16:37.70]Gift collectible.
[16:42.86]This is just the tutorial.
[16:48.01]Okay.
[16:48.43]Is that the alt girl I saw from earlier?
[16:53.22]uh hey mind letting go on my shirt there was this huge demon chasing after me where where are you looks like I lost it what was wrong with me you'd protect me if it came back though right no sorry I got a boat to catch you're on your own kid
[17:20.02]You know how I feel about being called kid, White.
[17:24.18]I actually don't remember.
[17:26.20]Amnesia?
[17:27.55]Side effect of dying, it seems.
[17:29.01]Two-voice Andy.
[17:31.83]Seriously?
[17:32.43]They feel really good, aren't they?
[17:33.91]I got this one.
[17:35.61]I've got this one on lockdown, you know what I mean?
[17:39.91]I don't find me somebody that can do this better than me.
[17:44.93]You won't be able to find it.
[17:46.45]You're not alone.
[17:47.09]I don't think so.
[17:48.09]I've lost some memories too.
[17:49.63]Like, I can't even remember how to use a gun, which makes this whole situation extra scary.
[18:01.29]Bugleberry?
[18:01.93]No, no, no.
[18:03.00]Bugleberry is more like this.
[18:04.58]If you'd like to know where the bugleberry voice comes from, it's very easy to tell you.
[18:12.32]Although maybe it should be sort of a mystery.
[18:14.22]It'll tell you everything.
[18:17.48]Won't you at least show me how?
[18:19.43]Please, please, please.
[18:21.13]Somebody got it.
[18:32.35]Yes.
[18:33.55]Yes.
[18:34.11]The inspiration for Bugleberry's voice is none other than our favorite cartoon character, Captain Crunch.
[18:41.10]My Captain Crunch cereal.
[18:48.31]There's a little bit of inspiration there, I think.
[18:53.69]There's a lore bomb right there.
[18:59.50]It's a few different people.
[19:01.80]It's a few different people.
[19:03.62]But Bugleberry is like 33% Captain Crunch.
[19:09.50]I don't know.
[19:10.78]I should probably get going.
[19:15.20]You wouldn't really abandon a cute girl like me, would you?
[19:18.96]I know you don't remember, but you were once a great teacher.
[19:30.97]Mr. White?
[19:32.67]I... I was?
[19:35.49]Well, okay, fine.
[19:38.67]I can spare a second, I guess.
[19:42.87]You want to bend your knees a bit.
[19:44.67]Arms extended, but not locked.
[19:46.73]Is this good?
[19:52.89]Yeah, but keep it steady.
[19:55.95]You should use both hands and fill any open spaces on the grip with your fingers.
[20:04.11]Oh, there's something kind of exhilarating about this, huh, Mr. White?
[20:09.54]I'm just looking through the chat and just seeing just the people that are not, they're not even participating in the chat.
[20:20.25]Hold hard metal in my hands.
[20:23.23]That hint of danger.
[20:25.90]The game is probably muted.
[20:27.82]You probably have no video on.
[20:28.82]And you're just talking about what you had for dinner today.
[20:34.02]Anyway.
[20:34.56]Like this?
[20:42.02]Holy crap.
[20:43.72]Are you sure you forgot?
[20:50.81]You know, it's like you said, I'm a great teacher.
[20:57.41]You just did the thing with his face.
[20:59.73]Neon violet.
[21:12.57]Alright.
[21:18.21]It's time.
[21:19.09]Let's... Uh, uh-huh.
[21:23.55]Purify bombs.
[21:24.83]Destroy red breakable walls.
[21:27.39]So... Did I do that right?
[21:32.28]Does it work?
[21:34.22]Oh.
[21:35.66]Destroy groups of enemies.
[21:40.33]It takes about a second.
[21:49.79]Not bad.
[21:56.83]And my grandma keeps that no.
[22:01.04]I think we've answered enough.
[22:02.36]My grandmother asked this question questions to last us a few years, I think.
[22:11.79]Stand near the explosion so you can like rocket jump.
[22:18.19]Does it give you forward momentum too?
[22:19.52]I'm imagining yes.
[22:26.92]Yep.
[22:43.38]Sounds nothing like Bugleberry.
[22:45.78]Well, that's why I said it was inspiration.
[22:47.70]It wasn't necessarily a one to one impression.
[22:50.64]Is there a boss at the end of this?
[23:16.59]Do it again.
[23:20.37]I didn't mean to... I didn't want to do that.
[23:33.10]I must have missed it.
[24:03.27]It's a bronze medal.
[24:15.48]19 demons.
[24:24.10]Okay, well, I'm fine.
[24:32.21]What the hell?
[24:33.34]Oh, it's hell.
[25:01.82]That's how we use the environment.
[25:19.63]Cleared it.
[25:20.27]Bronze.
[25:21.95]Bronze is the best.
[25:23.92]No expectations.
[25:26.98]You're not in second place, because in second place you would feel like, damn, I wish I was first place.
[25:32.16]You just get awarded for being cool.
[25:35.22]But there's no pressure of second place.
[25:36.75]You wish you were first.
[25:37.45]There's no pressure of first place.
[25:38.59]Give me bronze all day.
[25:41.43]If I do that again, somebody ban the channel.
[25:53.08]I don't know if mods can do that or not, but
[25:55.58]demon zero red a hundred and the channel if it happens again long time no see white neon red I recognize her from before this girl is you're staring quick say something cool white that is a massive rifle want a taste
[26:26.11]Uh, that's okay.
[26:27.99]Seriously, please don't point that thing at me.
[26:30.51]Did you realize that this is the least effective way for you to get me here?
[26:34.71]Because the barrel is very long and the target here is now very small.
[26:39.89]So now if I go, I dodge my shoulder, grab the barrel, push it over, then this is a problem for you now.
[26:47.86]Relax.
[26:48.90]I just like to see you sweat.
[26:54.89]Okay, John Wick.
[26:55.89]In that case, you should watch me wipe the floor with demons sometime.
[27:00.91]I'll pass.
[27:01.81]I've seen a lifetime of that kind of thing.
[27:07.36]You know, this is actually the first time I've seen you here.
[27:11.08]In the competition, I mean.
[27:12.86]Makes me wonder, do you think this will end for us the way it did in life?
[27:17.30]You see, I'd love to answer that, but I woke up with no memories of life.
[27:23.19]Not that I don't recognize you.
[27:24.57]It's just the details are fuzzy.
[27:29.21]So far, though, I feel the strongest connection to you.
[27:35.08]Damn it, White.
[27:36.50]Why would you say something so lame to a girl?
[27:39.72]How bizarre.
[27:41.12]I've never heard of a neon with such an affliction.
[27:43.10]You're not messing with me, are you?
[27:48.91]have no reason to lie to you is that so can't believe God himself decided to bless me with the thing I love most a completely clueless boy this isn't fun for me you know well it is for me we could have been lovers in life and you'd be none the wiser were we lovers
[28:18.16]I could know every last one of your measurements be serious here we've got a long boat ride ahead maybe you could fill me in on the details of my character or even your relationship to me I don't know why honestly it's probably easier this way for both of us what hey wait where are you going
[28:49.76]all aboard the ship heaven stragglers will be returned to oblivion yes don't think I made it this far last time this really is my first rodeo what happens if I press half bad looks like oh that's what happens not bad for a dead guy huh
[29:18.55]I feel like we missed something really important.
[29:22.56]I thought it was going to be fast forward and it was going to be like... I thought it was going to be funny, but... Heaven is exactly what I expected.
[29:29.46]I don't know why I'm so disappointed.
[29:37.36]Oh, what?
[29:39.64]Want to walk to the believer's sermon together?
[29:42.48]I want to fight.
[29:43.32]I want to fight demons.
[29:44.51]Yo, bro, you made it.
[29:46.49]Ha ha ha.

[30:33.94]So that was the, I'm done talking.
[30:35.92]My dialogue cuts off here.
[30:37.57]There is a hyphen.
[30:39.09]Somebody needs to interrupt me.
[30:41.15]What happens a lot of the time is the person will say the line with the hyphen there and they'll stop.
[30:49.54]So it'd be like, oh, you and meh.
[30:53.08]Oh yeah.
[30:54.10]And you get cut off now.
[30:55.93]how you do that you make that work a little better is you just hold the hold it at the end right you hold that last line like we were supposed to be going to the grocery oh then I'll give you that opportunity to cut me off dude no one cares this is an acting class out of where the where the hell did you think you were this is like a live streamer I play video games no I I'm teaching you acting skills

[33:17.10]It was a fun time.
[33:18.62]Episode 2, Killer Inside.
[33:23.61]I'm ready to kill some demons.
[33:27.07]10 days until judgment.
[33:31.47]Depart for your current assignment.
[33:32.85]Play past assignments.
[33:34.51]Let's go to the beach.
[33:36.07]Enjoy the view of the beach.
[33:40.73]I hate how perfect this beach looks.
[33:42.55]I feel like I should toss something in there.
[33:45.03]Next time.
[33:45.29]Do I have anything to throw?
[33:45.93]Alright, report to Heaven Central Authority.
[33:57.68]The next thing to do.
[33:58.30]Talk to Gabby.
[34:01.66]Hey.
[34:03.08]Uh...
[34:04.39]I'm here for my assignment?
[34:06.05]You will get new assignments from Mr. Mikey.
[34:08.89]I'm his secretary.
[34:09.93]Then let me talk to him.
[34:10.77]Is Mikey a cat too?
[34:12.52]Just let me read the script.
[34:14.42]This doesn't have to be difficult, unless you like that, Mr. White.
[34:18.32]Proceed.
[34:19.34]All Neons must achieve a minimum Neon rank in order to be granted a new assignment.
[34:24.57]What's a Neon rank?
[34:25.89]Your neon rank is determined by the number of gold or ace medals you have earned in prior missions.
[34:31.71]I won't be getting any of these.
[34:32.57]More golds or aces means a better rank.
[34:35.23]Let's see.
[34:36.45]My neon rank is this.
[34:38.57]Is that good enough?
[34:39.19]Like an A+.
[34:39.83]I'm sorry.
[34:41.07]You'll need to achieve this neon rank if you'd like to get your next assignment.
[34:46.82]Mr. White.
[34:47.30]Mr. White.
[34:48.40]Mr. White.
[34:52.02]How do I increase my neon rank?
[34:57.10]Just visit the job archive at Heaven's Gate.
[35:02.76]Earn gold or ace medals.
[35:04.36]Got it.
[35:05.26]I'll be right back.
[35:05.82]All right, let's go get some medals.
[35:09.16]We have three more neon ranks.
[35:10.80]I think I have to go here, right?
[35:13.58]Depart for your sign.
[35:15.44]Visit job archive.
[35:19.06]Where do I get a new mission?
[35:25.43]Did I not get it?
[35:27.36]I'm ready for my next mission.
[35:28.50]Mr. White, it says here you've achieved.
[35:31.94]Just visit the job office.
[35:34.60]I'll be right back.
[35:36.80]You guys make me skip the dialogue so fast.
[35:43.15]Wait, I didn't do good enough?
[35:45.45]Is that what it's telling me?
[35:46.25]I have to go way faster.
[36:13.31]This is a speed running game.
[36:17.11]You're going so slow.
[36:18.71]Am I?
[36:18.97]That was 27.
[36:22.83]That's a gold medal.
[36:24.57]I just got it.
[36:25.05]93, right?
[36:28.98]I'm doing fine.
[36:33.12]Alright, let's just go in a row.
[36:35.90]What did I get on this one?
[36:37.14]Okay, bronze.
[36:37.62]I need to do this in 13 seconds.
[36:41.56]Great start up.
[36:48.54]Let's see if I can make that gap.
[37:03.75]That's a platinum medal.
[37:04.80]Alright, I get it.
[37:13.46]Pretty sure I just got 293.
[37:23.71]Uh, this was silver, but I can do it in 19, right?
[37:25.80]Let's do it.
[37:38.53]I forgot I have to actually kill this stuff.
[37:58.50]That was fucking messy.
[38:00.24]Alright, hold on.
[38:18.58]Another one down.
[38:23.05]It's pretty cool.
[38:23.73]It is, yeah.
[38:24.13]This is fun.
[38:27.15]I'm enjoying it.
[38:28.99]Okay, next mission time.
[38:41.92]10 days until judgment.
[38:43.52]Let's go get a new assignment.
[38:46.80]Well, look at that.
[38:48.61]Your neon rank is sufficient to move on to a new assignment.
[38:52.85]Sounds are really, really good together.
[38:54.53]Heavenly delight ticket.
[38:56.35]How fun.
[38:59.43]Ticket granted to top-performing Neons, good for one Heavenly Delight.
[39:02.80]Visit the Heavenly Delight kiosk in the Cathedral to redeem an experience beyond your wildest dreams.
[39:07.38]One moment while I check on Mr. Mikey's schedule.
[39:14.34]Have a seat.
[39:15.48]In about four hours.
[39:17.32]Four hours?
[39:18.86]Why?
[39:19.20]No... There's gotta be somebody I can speak with sooner.
[39:22.91]I'll look into that for you.
[39:24.27]And when will that be?
[39:25.45]About four hours.
[39:26.65]Alright.
[39:27.79]This is ridiculous.
[39:28.69]I'm going...
[39:32.28]It is a cat.
[39:32.84]Mikey.
[39:33.48]Garfield.
[39:36.40]It's fine.
[39:36.72]I don't mind if he stays.
[40:02.41]Red?
[40:02.69]What are you doing in here?
[40:04.59]Suit yourself, sweetheart.
[40:06.09]Go ahead, wise guy.
[40:07.43]Take a freaking seat.
[40:08.27]Now, listen up, because I'm only going to say this once.
[40:11.54]You got 10 days here.
[40:13.38]The HCA will be rating your performance alongside the other competing Neons.
[40:18.24]And whoever has the top score and if they 10, win.
[40:21.72]I'm going to be this for Halloween this year.
[40:22.80]Don't steal my costume.
[40:24.74]I'm showing up to the party like this.
[40:26.28]You better not.
[40:27.72]We both have the same neon white costume.
[40:30.26]It's going to be not cool.
[40:34.44]I chose it first.
[40:36.44]No.
[40:37.54]No.
[40:37.88]I said it out loud first.
[40:43.80]I said it out loud first.
[40:47.66]For your first assignment, you jokers will be cleaning out lower heaven.
[40:54.76]Sounds easy enough.
[40:58.26]Shmucks like you always say.
[41:00.01]You'll even make it back to my office on day two.
[41:06.87]Because the demons got him, White.
[41:09.09]I forgot about the Dracula costume, that's right.
[41:11.61]Yeah, I kinda got that.
[41:17.13]Anyway, that just about covers it.
[41:19.59]Any questions?
[41:20.19]Yeah.
[41:21.33]Why are you a cat?
[41:22.45]Okay, you're just saying whatever to me now.
[41:24.74]I was actually wondering the same thing.
[41:27.16]Why are you a hilarious cartoon cat?
[41:29.84]Exactly.
[41:30.76]You Neons are all the same.
[41:32.92]He's gonna break that promise too?
[41:33.90]With moronic imagery your pea brains embedded in an effort to comprehend us angels.
[41:40.47]Oh, you're a cat.
[41:41.61]You're a horse.
[41:42.57]You're a sexy Statue of Liberty.
[41:44.81]How about a... Hey, Mikey.
[41:46.53]How's your day, Mikey?
[41:48.17]Excuse me.
[41:48.97]I'm here for my appointment.
[41:51.10]Hey, White.
[41:52.28]Isn't it freaking crazy that John Cena is here in heaven giving us missions?
[41:58.18]John Cena in this game?
[41:59.48]That's it.
[42:00.34]Everybody out.
[42:01.68]Don't come back till you finish your missions.
[42:04.71]And Gabby, can you please keep these Neons under control?
[42:13.81]Hey Red, before you go, I wanted to ask you if you, uh, knew what the deal is with Green?
[42:21.01]Stay away from him.
[42:22.19]Uh-huh.
[42:22.75]He's... I could use some convin... I suppose I could open up more in exchange for a favor.
[42:28.30]Wait, really?
[42:29.76]Keep your pants on while... What's the favor?
[42:32.22]How long will that be?
[42:33.56]Like, after this mission?
[42:39.59]That's kind of good.
[42:40.14]Another calf.
[43:07.18]You said you wanted a drink, right?
[43:09.36]I know a place.
[43:10.08]Follow me.
[43:11.63]Uh, why not?
[43:17.11]Ta-da!
[43:18.63]Welcome to the Neon Bar.
[43:20.55]You like it?
[43:21.63]Oh, it's not like the rest of heaven, that's for sure.
[43:24.34]I'm into it.
[43:26.32]Thanks.
[43:27.32]Can I actually order drinks?
[43:28.76]Does it give me boosts?
[43:30.62]So, uh, who exactly are you?
[43:34.32]You can call me Raz.
[43:35.53]I'm the bartender here.
[43:38.24]I'm imagining you probably buy cards, boosts.
[43:43.33]White.
[43:44.07]Well, white, good to meet you.
[43:46.31]Believers don't come around these parts anymore.
[43:48.15]So, it's the perfect place for neons to take a load off.
[43:52.51]I like the sound of that.
[43:53.75]What do you have?
[43:54.41]How about one of those piña coladas?
[43:56.01]On it.
[43:59.54]Here you go.
[44:00.54]What the?
[44:01.58]This is literally just water.
[44:04.14]Sorry, the believers are hogging all the real stuff.
[44:07.73]What?
[44:08.05]How can you call this a bar if you don't serve any booze?
[44:11.08]See, you're thinking too narrow.
[44:13.74]A bar gives you one guy and Biden and another guy.
[44:18.77]What is my pina colada?
[44:20.65]I'm just saying friend and folks in heaven has its benefits.
[44:24.13]You'd be surprised by what you can gain from chatting people up and maybe giving them some gifts.
[44:29.56]The believers wouldn't accept my pina colada patronage.
[44:33.10]I doubt they'd let me into their crappy gift shop.
[44:35.74]Well, no.
[44:36.96]Once you've taken care of your missions, you can do a second sweep to hunt for presents.
[44:43.72]And hey, if you give me a gift,
[44:51.85]Alright, let's go.
[44:59.26]Lemon water, pause.
[45:00.56]So I have to choose a companion?
[45:15.77]Come on, White.
[45:17.07]Join me.
[45:18.01]I'm clearly the cutest choice to hear.
[45:20.69]I don't know.
[45:22.33]I'm pretty freaking cute.
[45:23.65]Guys, guys.
[45:25.35]I'm flattered, but this is a competition.
[45:27.48]I'm not here to make friends.
[45:29.06]Yo, I totally get you.
[45:30.48]That's why we should all team up.
[45:33.20]No way.
[45:34.04]Three's a crowd.
[45:36.04]I'd rather eat my own pancreas.
[45:38.26]Come on, Vi.
[45:39.30]You sure?
[45:40.85]What?
[45:41.03]Who?
[45:41.49]Alright, so do I have a power or something with...
[46:08.65]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[46:10.49]I'm not ready.
[46:10.89]Am I going too slow?
[46:39.96]Yeah.
[47:07.48]That was pretty good.
[47:09.28]That was gold.
[47:10.27]I'll take gold.
[47:18.03]I knew you would be bad at Splatoon story mode.
[47:22.66]True.
[47:29.40]Godspeed Soul Card.
[47:30.54]This Soul Card fires like a semi-automatic rifle.
[47:34.11]And you get a dash.
[47:35.41]Dash horizontally in the direction you're aiming.
[47:38.03]Destroys demons and breakable objects.
[47:41.05]How far is it, okay?
[47:52.37]Oh, that was sad, but I can do it.
[47:54.83]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[47:55.63]We're doing that again.
[47:56.41]We're doing that again.
[48:08.06]Oh, I can't just cheat?
[48:13.21]Can I just cheat?
[48:16.73]So it doesn't... Okay.
[48:18.90]You can't get any vertical.
[48:20.52]It's only horizontal.
[48:21.50]Only.
[48:28.53]Wait a minute.
[48:45.09]Can I break this without dashing?
[48:46.64]Oh well.
[49:04.66]13.
[49:04.69]Another one down.
[49:06.71]Bold only.
[49:16.38]Use the first Godspeed to get on the podium and you can just jump?
[49:18.96]Interesting.
[49:30.28]Oh, that was a bonehead move.
[49:41.87]I can do that better.
[49:43.43]How much faster do I have to do?
[49:44.55]18? 17?
[49:48.66]I can do 19.
[49:48.98]How do I get that?
[50:04.68]Wait, that's me.
[50:26.24]There it is.
[50:26.74]Yeah!
[50:31.10]Yippee!
[50:31.72]This is the perfect game for a fake manga fan like you.
[50:48.00]I see it.
[50:48.94]Oops.
[50:49.92]Only one shot?
[50:56.55]He just died instantly.
[51:19.16]Where do I go?
[51:30.64]Shit.
[51:35.00]22 seconds?
[51:35.62]I can do it.
[51:37.20]So if you dash through, you get another one.
[51:55.07]Platinum?
[51:56.15]Yay!
[51:58.91]Hey, I missed some of the stream.
[51:59.67]Did he go to hell and was Ben Franklin there?
[52:01.67]Uh, I'm not sure yet.
[52:11.48]Hell yeah, dude.
[52:17.88]Oh, wait.
[52:18.38]Okay, this is a double here.
[52:20.80]This is a grab this chute and then this is a boom boom.
[52:33.88]I can't really tell, but whatever.
[52:36.63]Oh, my God, I blew it.
[52:38.15]I thought that somebody was still alive.
[52:40.41]Oh, it's just it's one of the other neons.
[52:42.26]OK, I thought it was an enemy.
[53:19.31]Only silver.
[53:19.99]What am I missing here?
[53:26.46]12 seconds.
[53:26.88]What am I missing here?
[53:39.07]Go, go, go, go, go.
[53:41.77]Ah!
[53:43.05]All right.
[53:43.31]Settle down.
[54:09.83]The dash, somebody said the dash does go vertical.
[54:11.99]I can't get it to go vertical.
[54:20.70]Does the dash work?
[54:21.86]Okay, when you hit an enemy with a dash, does it actually just refill it?
[54:26.18]Doesn't, only on those big ones.
[54:41.43]Hmm.
[54:43.39]How do I get up there that fast?
[55:00.50]Fuck.
[55:02.16]Damn it.
[55:02.70]I lost time on that.
[55:05.18]Skip dropping down, just dash?
[55:09.21]Honestly?
[55:22.38]Shit.
[55:36.97]Wait!
[55:48.90]No, I have to break that.
[55:49.76]I have to kill the enemy down there.
[55:51.78]Skip the second door.
[55:52.48]I still have to kill the thing down there though, right?
[56:02.39]Fuck.
[56:05.51]Shoot it and then dash to the exit.
[56:09.68]God damn it.
[56:24.23]My brain can't do it.
[56:28.33]I mean, it can, but it's just too many things in a row.
[56:35.52]Alright, so... But how... Hold on.
[56:41.42]How do I skip... How do I kill that, but skip the door without getting the jump?
[56:46.88]I don't get it.
[56:51.85]Just go from here to there?
[56:56.78]Let me go slow.
[56:57.80]Okay.
[57:07.59]So if I just go like this.
[57:08.77]Alright, that's how you do it.
[57:12.14]I got it.
[57:33.48]I wonder if you can even do it normally.
[57:35.96]This is a fun game, I like this.
[57:37.84]You should do something quirky.
[57:56.50]Hey, uh, no.
[57:58.56]Sorry, I don't.
[58:00.10]Sounds like it was chill, though.
[58:01.72]Oh, great.
[58:02.04]He said he liked the game.
[58:03.00]Prepare to never see it after this stream.
[58:12.13]It was, man.
[58:13.07]I'd give my left nut to go back and do it all over again.
[58:16.37]Even all the weird stuff at the end.
[58:19.29]I don't blame you for any of it, you know.
[58:26.22]What the hell is that supposed to mean?
[58:27.70]Dude, chill.
[58:28.74]The vibes are immaculate.
[58:30.92]What?
[58:32.06]Did you just say that?
[58:33.79]You just said the vibes are immaculate?
[58:39.19]Really?
[58:40.35]Wow.
[58:41.55]Okay.
[58:46.66]I like this guy way more now.
[58:48.48]Yeah.
[58:49.72]Cool.
[58:52.84]my god dude remember when you messed up the toilet after you ate that chili that was insane yo hold up wait what that's not why would you that's a weird thing to bring up with somebody that's weird that's fucking strange I don't know what that just distracted me I don't
[59:21.26]That was very distracting, but I think I still got the gold medal.
[59:31.55]Every cutscene loses like 400 viewers.
[59:34.35]That's pretty funny.
[59:41.80]That's actually funny.
[59:50.40]Shit, I fell.
[59:54.30]Shit, I fell again.
[59:54.98]Every cutscene loses 500 viewers.
[59:58.74]I just went the long way.
[60:16.45]How did I lose time?
[60:52.72]Stop jumping.
[60:53.42]It doesn't do anything.
[61:08.64]I feel like I was pretty close to the platinum one.
[61:13.96]Let me see.
[61:21.00]Probably one or two seconds.
[61:24.01]I can definitely get it.
[61:24.75]Let's get it.
[61:40.79]Oh, sad.
[62:18.20]Bounce.
[62:19.46]Shoot.
[62:24.75]Platinum.
[62:26.67]I think your VTuber avatar isn't rigged right.
[62:30.43]This base isn't moving.
[62:42.80]I feel like I just lost time there.
[62:48.82]Let's do that again.
[62:53.44]Oops.
[62:59.37]That's definitely the best way to go.
[63:03.16]Get a land right on the lip.
[63:04.90]I did it too shit.
[63:29.84]That might have been more accurate.
[63:53.40]Didn't even break a sweat.
[63:54.74]Unfortunate.
[64:06.31]You just have to hop over the side.
[64:09.87]26?
[64:10.67]Oh yeah, I can have that.
[64:12.19]That extra second was just the beginning.
[64:13.76]I know I'm supposed to get the presents, but whatever.
[64:37.94]There it is.
[64:38.76]And that's how it's done.
[64:39.91]Let's do a Ben and Jerry's tier list.
[64:47.95]Half-baked S, everything else A. Everything else A. I don't even need to show it on screen.
[65:16.06]Oh, a little too, a little too far there.
[65:19.08]I'm gonna hold this.
[65:26.69]Damn it.
[65:36.99]I'm holding it for way too long.
[65:54.38]I can definitely do it.
[65:55.14]100%.
[66:08.19]Ready?
[66:12.96]Oh, fuck you.
[66:13.80]I can definitely do it.
[66:14.56]That's going to shave like three seconds off, too.
[66:28.09]Oh, come on.
[66:33.27]I know I can do it.
[66:44.36]It's right there, but whatever.
[66:46.86]Let's try it the regular way.
[67:03.79]I guess I could shoot and skip this whole thing.
[67:06.47]I'm going to skip that whole section.
[67:25.41]I freaked out.
[67:26.11]Where do I go?
[67:26.45]Hold on.
[67:26.65]Where is it?
[67:28.49]Hold on.
[67:30.84]I'm freaking out.
[67:39.04]I need to see it again.
[67:39.80]Because it's... Bounce off... Okay, it's over here.
[67:46.22]Can I just skip this whole section?
[67:47.48]If I shoot those two in the beginning, I need to end up up there.
[67:52.51]Okay.
[67:59.03]See it up.
[67:59.43]Okay.
[68:12.44]I don't... Maybe I can't.
[68:45.51]That was still gold somehow.
[68:46.81]What is it?
[68:47.33]What is platinum?
[68:47.73]Alright, that's a pretty fair amount that I still need to do.
[68:58.19]Let me try that again.
[69:03.89]Oh, it's gone.
[69:04.49]Oops.
[69:22.77]Oh, there it is.
[69:27.53]No, I know where to go.
[69:45.63]You stupid idiot.
[70:24.72]All right, this is the last level here in this particular zone.
[70:37.15]I mean, we're kind of just going here.
[71:06.80]Ooh, that was kind of ugly, but it's alright.
[71:12.45]I wonder where the skips are.
[71:13.37]I think I can just go faster and I should get it.
[71:18.05]Ah, I blew it.
[71:57.58]Alright.
[71:58.80]22.
[71:59.00]I'm making a lot of noises, sorry.
[72:04.41]I can go faster.
[72:05.11]I just gotta get the whole thing down.
[72:06.11]I'll get it.
[72:07.53]Just skip that whole top part.
[72:10.07]Let me look at it.
[72:18.62]Oh!
[72:18.90]Look at that!
[72:40.86]I'm so- I'm getting so- I'm getting ahead of myself.
[72:48.10]Oh, fuck you.
[73:14.49]Oh, 23.9.
[73:44.28]Shit in my pants. 23.3.
[74:29.59]Fuck you!
[74:31.27]Shit!
[74:40.53]Ow!
[74:56.55]Oh, you idiot!
[74:57.53]I hate you!
[75:01.00]It's falling apart.
[75:01.58]It's falling apart.
[75:02.50]It's falling apart.
[75:02.96]I gotta get back.
[75:03.48]Come on.
[75:19.02]What are you talking about, game?
[75:20.24]What are you happening?
[75:21.60]What?
[75:22.24]I didn't go through?
[75:22.88]Why?
[75:45.52]How is that slow?
[75:57.94]It's falling apart.
[76:04.42]Is that even faster?
[76:06.82]That might be adding time, by the way.
[76:12.48]That's adding time.
[76:35.32]Oh, you piece of shit!
[76:36.70]20- Oh my god.
[77:13.57]I don't like this guy in front of me.
[77:14.59]I don't like it.
[77:15.53]He's doing way better than me every time.
[77:17.37]It's annoying.
[77:26.63]Wait a minute.
[77:27.07]Hold on.
[77:27.65]Hold on a second.
[77:29.77]I may have just solved it.
[77:43.51]Oh yeah.
[77:45.03]I don't think I can get high enough.
[78:04.66]Somebody said shoot the glass.
[78:05.76]I don't think that works.
[78:26.26]I can get that high.
[78:31.05]Just look at the hand icon.
[78:35.45]Where is it?
[78:36.65]Oh, I see it over there.
[78:42.61]What does it want me to do, though?
[78:43.73]Hold on.
[78:44.59]I'm going to jump this way.
[78:50.22]I get it.
[79:09.28]This is fucking sloppy.
[79:11.60]So how many more demons are there?
[79:13.00]Four.
[79:15.28]Where are they?
[79:16.84]One, two, three.
[79:17.14]Okay, I get it.
[79:28.48]Oh, come on.
[79:33.26]I didn't mean to click twice.
[79:35.08]When you do the same level like 100 times, sometimes your brain just is like, you know what?
[79:38.12]Just do it terribly this time.
[79:40.46]And do it terribly 10 times in a row.
[79:57.69]Still might be all right.
[80:08.74]I got the platinum.
[80:09.40]I got the platinum.
[80:10.03]I got the platinum.
[80:14.39]That's a platinum on every level, isn't it?
[80:16.03]I like it.
[80:20.60]Huh?
[80:30.19]I gotta admit that was pretty cool all right do we lose four to five hundred viewers let's see I came up with it while watching you fight you're like my moose brother everyone's just everyone's it's kind of the end of the show and every people are just standing up and walking the show's not done but people are just getting up out of their seats and walking out
[80:57.99]We're in the bottom of the ninth inning, and my team is up by 150 runs.
[81:03.94]So that about does it for me and the kids tonight.
[81:09.28]We're going to go home.
[81:11.54]Wait, I'm not starting to like this guy, am I?
[81:17.02]Hey, it's all good.
[81:17.68]It doesn't matter if 10,000 people leave.
[81:19.20]It could be a thousand of you hanging out here and I'd still do it.
[81:21.48]What about 10?
[81:21.74]Nah.
[81:21.86]At least... 12.
[81:43.06]Yo, I didn't think I'd actually get to save your life this fast.
[81:50.72]You really gotta be more careful, bro.
[81:53.03]Here, take my hand.
[81:59.28]I don't like the concept of a second channel.
[82:02.43]But... Nah.
[82:05.89]If I'm going to be just kind of chilling out here, whatever.
[82:09.27]If you're either here or you're not.
[82:11.73]A second channel is... I don't know.
[82:14.65]I feel like I would just do the same thing I'm doing right now.
[82:19.50]The master of comedy, yeah.
[82:30.28]You freaking crack me up, dude.
[82:32.24]Yeah, I'm just going to do whatever.
[82:34.82]What?
[82:35.68]I'm just going to do whatever.
[82:36.82]What?
[82:37.74]If there's one thing I've heard about you, bro.
[82:39.81]Does that mean 5,000 people leave?
[82:41.55]But you really got a heart.
[82:42.69]Whatever, who cares?
[82:44.99]We wouldn't be best bros if I didn't trust you to have my back.
[82:47.15]Who gives a crap?
[82:48.13]And like, vice versa.
[82:51.73]Next time, I'll save you for real.
[82:55.43]Tell even worse jokes on a second channel.
[83:04.90]Not bad for a dead guy, huh?
[83:10.87]Oh shit, viewers increasing.
[83:12.87]No, no, that's... We don't want that.
[83:15.29]We want to... We want to drop below 10k.
[83:17.95]We don't want to have there be more people here.
[83:19.55]Welcome back, Neons.
[83:21.31]You survived your first mission.
[83:24.78]But surviving is not the same as winning.
[83:31.43]Please direct your attention to Green's mechanical halo, a mechanism that grants Neons the ability to stay in heaven.
[83:41.33]Get them out of here.
[83:42.24]We're looking for negative growth.
[83:46.58]I say, I want to hit negative growth.
[83:48.16]I want people to... I want less people to be here.
[83:50.26]Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.
[83:52.62]I want the least amount of people to be here.
[83:55.66]That could be.
[83:57.96]What negative growth?
[83:59.00]Not when he's made such a comfortable home for himself here in paradise.
[84:02.33]Isn't that right?
[84:19.29]Wait, are you saying that even if we win, we don't get to stay in heaven forever?
[84:24.95]Oh, goodness, no.
[84:27.25]God's mercy has its limits.
[84:31.71]And an expiration date.
[84:34.05]Seriously?
[84:34.67]That's such a rip-off.
[84:39.15]If you'd prefer the flames of hell for eternity to a year of heavenly delights, be my guest.
[84:50.94]He looked at dark and darker.
[84:56.54]I have seen a lot of people playing it on stream.
[84:58.84]I know they added a couple of classes, right?
[85:02.50]Gee, thank you.
[85:13.69]I'm not trying to skip dialogue.
[85:16.33]I'm just trying to get us to a position where I can do the next chapter in the time that I would like to continue to stream.
[85:24.90]So it's not about skipping the dialogue.
[85:27.69]It's about getting to the action so I can do the chapter so I can continue to play it in the time that I would like to be streaming.
[85:40.64]I'm not, I'm not skipping this, but I'm just.
[85:42.40]Okay.
[86:07.66]Okay, I want to do the section and that's probably going to be the end of the stream.
[86:11.68]But I do want to do this section.
[86:14.14]This is important dialogue.
[86:27.83]Let's go!
[86:28.05]Okay, I got it.
[86:28.43]Come on Gwen.
[86:56.48]Ah, come on, wait.
[87:05.21]Uh, what?
[87:15.05]I cannot kill that.
[87:15.95]Is this just line of sight?
[87:26.09]Uh, wait a minute.
[87:33.80]That's pretty stupid.
[87:41.51]Uh huh, OK.
[87:56.73]Fuck, I don't get it.
[87:57.39]I mean, I do, but I don't.
[88:01.29]Because you have to kill everything.
[88:04.35]So how would... Does that count as a demon?
[88:09.42]Do I actually have to kill this thing?
[88:10.78]Is it... Hold on.
[88:14.14]It does count.
[88:20.86]Hmm...
[88:29.88]Did I not make that?
[88:30.86]I guess I... That was very slow.
[88:35.42]Am I even going the right way?
[88:41.03]Wait, what the hell is down here?
[88:42.33]Okay, hold on.
[89:20.52]I feel like this was done very poorly, but whatever.
[89:22.84]No?
[89:30.79]Not bad.
[89:32.63]Could be better, but it's okay.
[89:40.78]It's a lot of time to shave off.
[89:42.88]I might come back to it.
[89:47.40]Yeah, gold's good.
[89:48.22]You don't have to get platinum on every single one.
[89:50.45]So, machine gun.
[89:52.79]Stomp on the ground to create a large blast that destroys most demons and breakable objects.
[89:58.26]Very clear.
[89:58.92]Okay.
[90:30.40]Yeah, yuck.
[90:33.22]Yeah, that that was yuck.
[90:36.10]I wonder if I can.
[90:37.18]I think I can just skip that whole part.
[91:00.37]Right.
[91:29.47]Ooh, I missed.
[91:37.31]Ah, I'll get it.
[91:39.09]Got him, right?
[91:57.37]Yeah.
[91:58.49]Did you see that?
[92:03.79]Hey viewer, did you pet your pet today?
[92:05.66]Go show them some love, I agree.
[92:42.25]I don't know where to go.
[92:47.09]Not bad.
[92:53.17]I can get a couple seconds shaved off of that.
[93:06.98]I think that's actually the play.
[93:08.68]No, it's not.
[93:09.19]Not at all.
[93:39.41]20, yeah!
[93:46.39]I still can't believe the Winnie the Pooh question.
[93:48.35]I'm gonna think about that for like a week.
[93:58.82]Can I?
[94:00.00]Maybe?
[94:04.56]Maybe?
[94:04.92]No, I can't.
[94:13.62]That's I gotta make that a lot cleaner.
[94:59.76]Oh, what a mistake.
[95:17.90]What?
[95:18.26]Broke it.
[95:44.01]I can probably get platinum.
[95:44.87]What is it probably?
[95:45.35]19?
[95:45.37]18?
[95:45.39]I could do 20.
[95:45.71]I should be able to get 20.
[96:16.66]Excuse me, what was... There was a hint right there.
[96:18.93]Hold on.
[96:27.75]What's the goal here?
[96:35.14]Oh, does that help?
[96:56.05]Oh, okay.
[96:56.83]Sloppy, but I got it.
[96:57.95]I'm gonna dash through the door for more time.
[97:13.36]That's true.
[97:14.02]I got caught right there.
[97:30.22]Oh, saving time.
[97:34.00]Yeah.
[97:44.25]How old do you think we are, Jerma?
[97:45.81]I think it, I don't know.
[97:49.00]This is a pretty big range.
[98:04.11]I got stuck.
[98:04.83]Oops.
[98:05.41]Oh, it's over.
[98:05.99]Maybe not.
[98:09.69]Oh.
[98:11.57]Eh, it's alright.
[98:14.34]What's your target demographic?
[98:15.44]This is a mature audience stream.
[98:20.26]The stream is for adults.
[98:23.32]If you're not an adult, get out of here.
[98:27.20]Get the fuck out of here if you're not an adult.
[98:30.18]Damn, that sucks.
[98:34.15]Are you going to skip the story?
[98:40.77]Yeah.
[98:43.08]Damn, dude.
[98:46.84]I love it in all caps in the middle of this.
[98:49.08]Everybody leave.
[98:50.46]It's a cut scene.
[98:54.56]And look what happened.
[98:57.63]Actually, I think I'm all right with that.
[98:58.59]I think I got the whole gist of what just happened.
[99:00.97]I'm okay with that.
[99:01.95]I think I understand everything.
[99:03.25]I've comprehended everything that happened.
[99:09.59]Uh...
[99:32.91]Silver?
[99:37.98]That was a gold if I ever seen it.
[99:58.39]Why am I getting this?
[100:00.75]That's completely unnecessary.
[100:06.83]Just skip that whole section.
[100:07.71]I don't know why I'm getting the falling down so gently.
[100:11.26]There's a way to go down there, but I'm going to keep my tactic.
[100:32.43]My tactic didn't even... Wait, what?
[100:38.38]Oh, that's sad.
[101:00.99]1647.
[101:01.19]Yeah.
[101:01.70]I didn't even need to use the thing.
[101:02.86]You see that?
[101:04.00]Don't even need the hand.
[101:04.84]I got the ace metal without it.
[101:07.00]Could have gotten 13 seconds, 14 seconds, but it's all good.
[101:14.36]Okay.
[101:26.19]Okay.
[101:36.01]Oh, uh, oops.
[101:48.24]OK, well, we'll try that again.
[102:19.10]I'm doing something really fucking wrong here.
[102:48.53]better, but I keep losing momentum over there.
[103:03.64]I bet I can skip that part.
[103:12.14]Whoa!
[103:13.02]I went way too high.
[103:14.68]Uh-oh.
[103:22.21]It was long.
[103:41.73]What part of your body did you wash last?
[103:43.69]My hands.
[103:44.19]It's a pretty good gotcha question though.
[104:05.67]Oh, fuck.
[104:06.19]No!
[104:06.38]I win.
[104:07.16]Yeah.
[104:07.68]I didn't know that's where it was.
[104:30.31]I think that's doable without any shortcuts.
[104:35.87]That was terrible.
[104:36.57]Let me try that again.
[104:40.75]Oh, come on.
[104:41.39]Let me try this too.
[104:59.71]Ready?
[105:06.37]OK, that's alright.
[105:21.88]Why did I fall?
[105:23.51]I just shaved off a full second right there.
[105:53.25]Oh, fuck off.
[105:54.51]I hate where that's placed.
[105:56.15]Bad placement.
[106:05.80]What is going on here?
[106:07.32]How come I keep just jumping over that?
[106:09.10]I have an idea.
[106:16.09]That idea was really dumb.
[106:24.01]Don't be impatient.
[106:25.03]That's my entire life.
[106:28.47]My whole life has been being impatient.
[106:31.45]My entire existence is built off of being impatient.
[106:36.04]Everything you've ever seen, you've ever heard, is because of my impatience.
[106:57.29]No!
[106:58.59]I used it.
[106:59.13]That was stupid.
[107:03.86]Where is it?
[107:04.16]Where is it?
[107:06.50]I know what to do.
[107:07.00]I got it.
[107:07.28]I got it.
[107:07.48]I got it.
[107:07.72]I got it.
[107:07.92]I got it.
[107:08.12]Just wait, wait, wait.
[107:29.69]I have to keep one of these.
[107:37.10]You idiot.
[107:38.22]I even knew what I had to do, too.
[107:40.62]I still did it wrong.
[107:42.57]My brain was like, do it like this, do it like this, do it like this.
[107:44.85]Oh, don't do it like that.
[107:45.75]Excuse me.
[107:54.09]Oh, why?
[107:55.89]Why?
[107:56.35]Oh my God.
[107:57.65]I just, I started overthinking everything.
[108:03.77]I didn't even want that thing equipped.
[108:04.87]I wanted the rifle.
[108:12.59]I wanted the rifle equipped.
[108:14.51]This thing.
[108:18.75]Okay.
[108:19.03]Do it right.
[108:27.75]I don't think that helps.
[108:36.92]Oh my God, damn it.
[108:38.84]I just, I keep getting there and forgetting the entire video game.
[108:44.86]I'm just like, yeah, jump, jump, jump.
[108:46.77]How do I, I don't know the buttons.
[108:47.71]How do I play?
[109:20.52]No, I need to jump.
[109:21.56]Oh my God, I'm about to skip the level.
[109:29.53]I know there's a hand over there, but I want to do it.
[109:31.05]I wanted to get it without the hand.
[109:51.58]Does that even save time?
[109:52.53]Hard to tell.
[109:57.03]That was stupid.
[109:57.75]That was really stupid.
[109:58.63]That was so stupid.
[110:05.20]I'm just... Nah, just go.
[110:06.04]Just go.
[110:06.24]Just go.
[110:06.48]I'm going to get stuck here for like four hours.
[110:07.90]Just go.
[110:08.46]Just end it.
[110:09.00]Go.
[110:09.10]Go.
[110:44.62]Excuse me!
[110:46.52]That's gotta be Platinum.
[110:47.94]Didn't even break a sweat.
[110:51.76]Excuse me!
[110:52.74]Just been exclaiming random loud sounds today.
[111:00.23]I'll give it one or two more attempts.
[111:01.81]Because this one was fun.
[111:10.56]That was yucky.
[111:15.39]I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[111:59.03]Oh, shut up.
[111:59.81]That's so stupid.
[112:00.67]That lip should not be as loud.
[112:02.28]You know what I mean?
[112:03.94]That was dumb.
[112:24.43]Oh, I thought I had one more.
[112:25.35]Oh, this game just hurts my brain.
[112:29.89]I thought I had one more dash.
[112:32.31]Oh, now it's all falling apart.
[112:33.23]I'm gonna have to just keep going.
[112:56.96]What the fuck?
[112:57.74]I didn't land.
[113:18.76]Stupid game.
[113:19.70]Actually stupid games.
[113:21.27]Like, how?
[113:21.85]Come on.
[113:32.34]I should have went through.
[113:32.96]Annoying.
[113:54.51]Oh, shut up.
[113:55.65]That's why I didn't have two, because sometimes things are stupid.
[113:59.25]What the fuck happened there?
[114:01.49]What happened there?
[114:02.83]What happened?
[114:03.55]Why did I not launch?
[114:11.08]Why did I not hit the barrel?
[114:16.84]Gamer fatigue.
[114:17.90]This is gamer fatigue for sure. 100%.
[114:39.27]I had the other dash.
[114:50.21]I had the other dash.
[114:51.23]I just didn't use it.
[114:52.25]All right, come on.
[114:52.89]This is the one.
[115:17.32]Why did he not hit the barrel?
[115:19.13]Rewind it and play it a thousand times in a row.
[115:31.04]The barrel is a gigantic pit box.
[115:33.18]How am I not hitting it?
[115:54.69]That's gotta be it.
[115:56.21]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[116:04.07]I can do it.
[116:06.55]It's just like walk up yet.
[116:18.42]Oh shut up.
[116:43.61]Oh my God.
[116:44.09]I move on.
[117:04.55]Alright, I think I missed a few people.
[117:39.06]I'll take it.
[117:39.92]I'll take it.
[117:40.28]I'll take it.
[117:40.58]I'll take it.
[117:40.90]I'll take it.
[117:41.22]How do you like the break?
[117:46.31]Soundtrack is great.
[117:56.12]Oh, I was so close.
[118:20.58]I'm trying to go so fast.
[118:30.53]Fuck.
[118:55.97]Yes!
[118:56.59]Alright, that's a good one to go out on.
[119:06.91]Your addiction is showing.
[119:07.82]I understand why a lot of you like this game.
[119:26.55]I'm kind of freaking out, but it's OK and working.
[119:28.09]That's not good.
[120:00.58]See, I fell off that one last time too.
[120:33.95]Better.
[120:35.01]Yeah.
[120:39.05]You haven't beaten Tomar in a single level.
[120:42.15]Yeah.
[120:44.19]Have I not?
[120:49.51]Well, whatever.
[120:50.47]That's all right.
[120:51.38]21.3.
[120:51.40]Bro.
[121:03.85]You're a snail.
[121:08.01]Do you think heaven has any hot springs we could soak in?
[121:11.78]Not bad for a dead guy, huh?
[121:12.70]Not skipping because I want to.
[121:13.80]I'm skipping because I'm skipping toilet or whatever.
[121:32.51]Looks like the believers are late to their own damn sermon.
[121:43.24]I'd feel weird.
[121:46.18]Come here often?
[121:47.90]Wait, we're not skipping this part.
[121:49.54]Just one of my little jokes.
[121:51.38]Sinners have a great sense of humor.
[121:53.46]You must have had quite an idyllic childhood.
[121:56.16]Anyway, you know your way around heaven, right?
[122:01.77]If you fight green, you will absolutely lose.
[122:04.75]I think I figured out what was going on.
[122:17.24]And that's the end of the stream.
[122:18.38]Thanks for watching.
[122:22.85]I know that a lot of you are saying that he's never going to play this game again.
[122:27.47]But I think I might disagree with you.
[122:35.35]I feel like I'm having fun with this one.
[122:39.95]But let's go over the remainder of the week coming up here.
[122:45.97]So next time I stream will probably be on Tuesday or Wednesday.
[122:51.29]I'm going to do sorcery part four.
[122:54.82]And then at some point during the weekend, I'd imagine probably Tuesday.
[123:02.68]Tuesday around this time, like five or six.
[123:08.26]And then this weekend coming up, really going to try to get the man versus machine stuff going.
[123:14.76]So that weekend of the 18th, 19th, 20th, there are other streamers.
[123:18.36]I need to make sure everyone can do the same day because I know that some scheduling conflicts exist.
[123:25.23]So somewhere in that Saturday, Sunday, I really want to.
[123:29.83]If a bunch of the people can't do it that I really want to play it with, then we'll figure it out.
[123:34.95]We'll move it around.
[123:37.25]But Sorcery Part 4 on Tuesday.
[123:40.39]Starting around 5 or 6 o'clock at night.
[123:45.83]And we'll do MVM at the end of the weekend there.
[123:54.75]And maybe I'll play this again.
[123:56.43]Just kind of hanging out one night.
[123:58.45]We'll see.
[124:03.21]Yeah, I'm very excited for Man vs. Machine.
[124:05.28]I have not played Man vs. Machine in a really, really long time.
[124:13.86]And getting a bunch of streamer buddies.
[124:17.47]And there should be a lot of fun.
[124:18.59]Especially the harder ones.
[124:19.45]Because that... TF2 Man vs Machine.
[124:21.85]Some of those tours are really, really hard.
[124:25.23]They don't mess around.
[124:38.51]Wave 666?
[124:39.99]I don't know about that.
[124:50.94]Take care of yourselves.
[124:52.92]Thanks for watching.
[124:54.84]I'll see you guys on Tuesday for Sorcery Part 4.
[125:00.88]Sorcery enjoyers have been waiting a long time.
[125:06.17]So let's feed them.
[125:08.35]Let's feed the Sorcery 4 indies.
[125:15.41]I told you I wasn't going to wait that long.
[125:18.70]We're not going to finish it on Tuesday, but we'll start it.
[125:20.78]Maybe take us three or four sessions to do it.
[125:35.83]Yeah, take care.
[125:36.75]Play viewfinder.
[125:40.41]Yeah, I'll find time to throw in just like a chill stream again.
[125:43.58]Maybe most of them are chill streams now.
[125:49.59]I like it though.
[125:51.11]Having a lot of fun doing this.
[125:52.75]I'm back to the back to the basics.
[126:03.78]I'll just get three.
[126:04.86]I don't know, maybe.
[126:07.48]All your streams are evil.
[126:11.46]Evil.
[126:14.28]I don't agree.
[126:19.70]Evil was capital, by the way.
[126:21.74]Evil.
[126:24.50]But yeah, take care of yourselves.
[126:29.31]Have a great weekend.
[126:31.07]See you on Tuesday.
[126:39.60]Voices of the Void?
[126:41.02]What is Voices of the Void?
[126:42.22]Is that a new game?
[126:54.38]It's a great game.
[127:01.72]I'll look into it.
[127:02.76]And I don't mean that in quotes.
[127:04.66]I'm actually going to look into it.
[127:05.69]All right, guys.
[127:10.13]See you later.
[127:12.29]Call your mother.
[127:14.55]Call your father, too.
[127:18.49]You know what?
[127:18.97]Get everybody in the room and play Monopoly.
[127:20.76]When was the last time you played Monopoly?
[127:25.01]I'm Monopoly.
[127:25.51]Why not?
[127:26.72]It's 1 a.m.
[127:30.18]They're all asleep.
[127:31.78]Call them tomorrow.
[127:32.58]Alright.
[127:34.02]See you guys later.
[127:37.35]Goodbye.
[127:45.69]Goodbye.
[128:23.33]you
