[ve:60.16.100]

[00:57.04]A little bit early.
[00:59.12]But that's because we're going for a long time.
[01:03.09]Hi.
[01:05.07]I just got kicked out of the game.
[01:06.33]What happened?
[01:07.57]What did he do?
[01:10.01]What did he just do?
[01:10.57]I got disconnected.
[01:13.38]Oh, God.
[01:13.88]What did he just do?
[01:14.84]What did he just do?
[01:17.76]Sorry.
[01:18.16]Takes two seconds to get in the game.
[01:19.16]Hi, everybody.
[01:19.68]Welcome to Vermintide 2.
[01:20.52]That's the plan for the first part of tonight.
[01:27.76]Gonna be playing with Etalyx.
[01:28.72]Vermintide 2 is a thing.
[01:32.06]It just went into its... beta.
[01:36.54]There's not a whole lot to do in the game so far, I don't think.
[01:39.50]I think there's only like three missions you can play?
[01:42.12]So we're gonna do this for a little while.
[01:45.62]Wait, Etalyx restarted his computer.
[01:48.22]That's not a good sign.
[01:50.14]That's a really bad first sign.
[01:53.90]I'm sure he's gonna come in here in a minute and be like, ah, fuck, I gotta restart my computer.
[01:58.65]Give me one second.
[01:59.42]Let me make sure I can get in contact with him.
[02:01.11]Give me a minute.
[02:31.20]Yeah, he's currently, I think, restarting, so... We can wait, we got plenty of time.
[02:35.74]We're like an hour and a half early.
[02:39.02]So, this stream will probably be a while.
[02:42.11]I'm not sure how long it's gonna take us to get through... Vermintide 2's beta content, but... I'm fairly confident that it'll take us at least a couple hours.
[02:52.08]And then after that, there's a few other options.
[02:54.12]We'll see where we are.
[02:54.94]We'll see how long it takes.
[02:56.00]Maybe we just do this.
[02:56.82]Maybe there's enough content to do this for the next four or five plus hours.
[03:01.60]We'll find out.
[03:07.84]I was a big fan of Vermintide 1.
[03:08.84]So obviously, if this game is just more Vermintide 1 with more stuff, more weapons, better environments, better monsters, more of everything, I'll probably love it.
[03:23.31]My mom is currently doing better.
[03:25.77]I do not have to go over there every other day every day now.
[03:29.97]Because she is walking on her own.
[03:33.12]She's moving around.
[03:33.86]She's got Zoom shoes on.
[03:37.48]So she's good.
[03:37.96]She's recovering very well.
[03:38.92]Thank you for the concern.
[03:44.00]And hopefully we didn't permanently lose Etalyx.
[03:51.15]Because, like, he's still not here.
[03:53.87]Thank you, SuperSeal, for the one dollar.
[03:55.27]Thank you, God, for the six hours of Jeremy.
[04:01.14]Let's hope that's gonna happen.
[04:02.88]Well, it will, regardless.
[04:05.66]Alright, so if Etalyx, like, just doesn't ever come back, then we're probably just gonna start Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[04:12.54]So, that is if Etalyx does not come back.
[04:16.32]Maybe Etalyx' computer just bricked while we were sitting here turning our streams on.
[04:26.62]Why does smelly have to mean that something smells bad?
[04:28.74]Why can't I be smelly in a good way?
[04:33.70]What do you mean?
[04:34.70]Smelly in a good way?
[04:38.76]Not everything that's smelly means it's bad.
[04:41.53]It just means it has a lot of smell.
[04:44.75]Like garlic is smelly.
[04:46.81]Garlic smells good, but it's smelly.
[04:49.93]That just means that there's a large odor surrounding what you're describing.
[04:57.95]Like, fruit?
[04:58.97]Fruit doesn't really have a smell.
[05:00.37]Besides citrus.
[05:03.51]I guess, do strawberries have a smell?
[05:07.17]No.
[05:07.99]I mean, they do.
[05:11.12]Grapes don't smell like anything.
[05:12.26]They just smell like water.
[05:14.76]Water has that distinct... Water has a really smelly smell.
[05:17.86]You know what I mean?
[05:19.32]Like, when I go to the tap and I turn the faucet and I start filling up my water, it stinks.
[05:25.14]Everyone's just like that, I assume.
[05:28.35]It tastes weird, too.
[05:30.29]Is it really, like, really acidic?
[05:31.82]Hey, thank God you're here, because you just saved me from my conversation I was just having.
[05:36.10]Are you good to go?
[05:39.67]What happened?
[05:40.43]Did your computer break?
[05:47.10]92% CPU.
[05:48.34]Oh, you're at 92% CPU.
[05:50.76]Yeah, it's bounced between 84 and 92, so I wanted to do a quick reboot to make sure that everything was in order.
[05:56.01]But here we are.
[05:57.23]So what?
[05:58.29]Are you good?
[05:59.63]I mean, we're gonna find out.
[06:01.54]We're gonna find out real soon.
[06:03.36]We are, yeah.
[06:06.10]So...
[06:07.55]How is... We got to get back in the same game.
[06:11.20]Yes, we do.
[06:11.58]And that's really the only issue.
[06:13.18]Okay.
[06:14.54]Sorry for scaring you immediately.
[06:16.96]I thought your computer crashed.
[06:19.18]We've been preparing for like an hour.
[06:21.32]And as soon as we start the stream, first thing I do is vanish.
[06:25.48]Yeah, the stream started and you're gone.
[06:28.32]Yeah.
[06:28.94]I was like, oh, no, he probably computer probably broke.
[06:32.86]I just wanted to light the fire under you a little bit, you know?
[06:36.17]Light the biggest fire in the North, have you ever seen?
[06:38.67]Alright, let me... What are we doing?
[06:41.45]Oh yeah, I have to join you, okay.
[06:42.79]That guy's in like a lot of TV shows now.
[06:44.85]Is he?
[06:45.89]He's in the one that... What's the one with the guys who set sail to Alaska and they get stopped and then a bunch of polar bears come and murder all of them?
[06:54.80]The Revenant.
[06:57.12]No.
[06:58.06]Uh, not that one.
[06:59.14]This is a TV show.
[07:00.38]Let's bring, let's bring this, let's bling, let's get some bling here.
[07:04.08]Let's get some bling on my character.
[07:05.46]There we go.
[07:11.18]So yes, this is, uh, yes, take a look at the top right.
[07:13.75]This is a beta.
[07:15.33]It's gonna be plastered on the screen the whole time.
[07:17.59]The bottom left is all kinds of coordinates.
[07:20.53]We're currently in the Atlantic Ocean somewhere.
[07:22.19]That's how you're doing.
[07:24.83]Is your computer okay?
[07:27.54]It's a little toasty, but... It's a little toasty.
[07:32.68]Well, hopefully it's not that toasty.
[07:35.94]It is.
[07:37.54]It is toasty enough where it is less toasty than Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[07:41.95]Okay, well, that's good.
[07:43.17]What is your CPU out on OBS right now?
[07:46.85]OBS is taking only 15% to 19%, yet I total have 83% to 94%.
[07:56.37]Well, that doesn't sound good.
[07:58.06]So either, one of two things, either Vermintide 2 is surprisingly resource-intensive, or... It might be.
[08:03.90]It might be very, I don't know.
[08:05.20]I might get a pretty large reality check wake-up call here in a second.
[08:09.58]Or I have a really old computer.
[08:12.23]We'll see.
[08:12.71]That makes me a man of the people, you know?
[08:14.57]Alright, so you want to go ahead and describe what we're doing here?
[08:17.59]What's happening here?
[08:19.49]Today we're going to be playing co-op Vermintide 2 with audio.
[08:23.23]Yeah.
[08:24.79]With audio?
[08:25.37]With audio.
[08:26.87]I forgot to unmute.
[08:28.75]I forgot to unmute.
[08:29.65]Alright.
[08:31.59]And Vermintide 2 comes out, what, March the 8th?
[08:34.45]Yes, it does.
[08:35.03]Currently in closed beta right now, which you can access and get into if you pre-order the game or got a key from Fat Shark.
[08:41.45]Oh, did you guys get a key from Fat Shark?
[08:42.75]We didn't.
[08:43.95]We've got about three missions to select from, from the smorgasbord of missions that I assume will be included in the full release.
[08:50.12]Take a look at this map.
[08:50.82]See, there's audio here, too.
[08:52.70]Every time I move, if I click on story mode, listen.
[08:55.86]Did you hear that?
[08:57.24]I like those little clicks.
[08:58.76]We've got Righteous Stand, the Athol Yin Lui, and Against the Grain.
[09:04.45]Okay.
[09:06.63]Let's do it the way that I shave, Against the Grain.
[09:10.03]How are we doing this?
[09:11.99]And we're going to be starting on the recruit difficulty.
[09:14.56]We're doing it on easy mode.
[09:16.10]Don't be angry with us.
[09:19.70]So do you have to pick the mission or do I pick the mission?
[09:22.29]I think you do.
[09:22.87]I believe either of us can pick a mission.
[09:25.23]This is your game.
[09:26.15]And we're going to be playing with some real life friends.
[09:30.23]Yep.
[09:31.12]Two real life friends.
[09:32.52]Let's find out who they are.
[09:34.90]Well, it's really funny, actually.
[09:36.40]Funny story about this.
[09:38.02]We both realized, we both found out that we both have a friend named Mark.
[09:43.49]Isn't that, like, funny?
[09:44.55]We're playing with two Marks.
[09:47.85]We're going to, just for the purposes, they don't have their mics.
[09:50.23]So Mark, we're going to call them Mark 1 and Mark 2.
[09:54.51]They're currently not in the game yet.
[09:55.75]They'll be joining in a minute here.
[09:56.77]I just want to make sure I get the IP to them, you know.
[09:59.61]So I'm going to accept it, make sure that we can make sure Mark and Mark both get in here.
[10:03.31]Yeah, and then they're both going to join on us.
[10:05.03]So Mark, if you're listening out there, all I got to do is go through Steam.
[10:08.09]I'm online on Steam right now on my friends list.
[10:10.70]And you'll just right click my name and then join game.
[10:13.70]Yeah, and Mark too, if you're listening, you don't exist, but it's okay.
[10:18.26]You'll be in here in a minute because I'll just think about you being here and you'll be there, okay?
[10:21.48]Okay.
[10:23.46]Alright, cool.
[10:24.08]That was really funny.
[10:25.78]Hey, look!
[10:30.20]It's the guy from, uh, Hand of Fate!
[10:35.74]My hope is that this, since this is the third mission in the list, that it's not the hardest mission.
[10:40.46]Wait, this is definitely gonna be the hardest.
[10:41.58]We don't even know what to do!
[10:46.08]Which one's, alright, which one's, which one are you?
[10:50.54]Reach the bill.
[10:51.96]Alright.
[10:52.22]Well, we have a couple of... Okay, which one is your mark?
[10:56.24]Mark one is here.
[10:56.98]Mark two is... Are you the... Oh, that's crazy.
[11:01.09]Both of their last names are the same.
[11:02.53]Well, that's... Sorry, I'm wrong.
[11:04.95]It wasn't Mark.
[11:07.31]It was two... Bob... Bob O. O. Turpentine is the two people we're playing with here.
[11:13.96]Bob O. Turpentine and Bill Ostrich Trainer.
[11:18.87]Can we just go?
[11:20.19]Can we please go?
[11:21.03]What are we doing?
[11:21.61]I'm the boss around here, and I determine which way we go.
[11:26.55]No one's following you, by the way.
[11:29.23]Both marks are sitting here waiting for my command.
[11:30.95]Why are the marks following you?
[11:33.47]I determine which route we take.
[11:35.07]I determine the path, okay?
[11:36.40]Alright, so this is Vermintide 2.
[11:39.82]One of these dead guys is going to jump up and try to eat us.
[11:42.66]I would imagine that is what happens in this video game, but...
[11:46.79]This is, if you never, if you have no idea what the fuck Vermintide is, essentially, it's Left 4 Dead.
[11:51.10]Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody said the same damn thing.
[11:54.04]I probably said this a year and a half ago.
[11:56.62]It's Left 4 Dead, but it's mostly melee-oriented, and it's all rats and old fan- It's fantasy Left 4 Dead, there you go.
[12:08.62]You know, there's all kinds of crazy shit that happens in this game.
[12:12.42]So, which way do we go?
[12:13.62]We have to jump over this?
[12:14.40]Turn some graphics settings down.
[12:16.24]Are you, like, still dying there?
[12:17.72]Are you, like, lagging really bad?
[12:19.55]Yeah.
[12:19.71]Alright, we're gonna reach the mill.
[12:23.85]So, while we wait for Etalyx to make sure his computer doesn't explode... I wish they would follow you.
[12:29.98]Why are they following me only?
[12:30.98]I don't know, because I think you're the host.
[12:34.49]So will there be a third game?
[12:36.51]I don't know.
[12:36.89]This game just came out in like beta.
[12:40.61]I don't know if there'll be a third Vermintide.
[12:42.41]Maybe I should FPS lock myself.
[12:44.23]I'm FPS locked at 120 and it ain't even helping.
[12:46.15]Alright, did we just go the wrong way or something?
[12:47.65]What's going on here?
[12:51.16]How do you FPS lock?
[12:53.32]Go into your settings.
[12:55.18]Go to video.
[12:56.88]And say, please make it so my FPS doesn't go past 120.
[13:03.69]Alright, I think, honestly, that fixed it.
[13:06.17]You good?
[13:07.09]I capped it at 60.
[13:08.89]Capped at 60?
[13:09.63]Does it work?
[13:10.17]Yeah.
[13:10.79]Are you working?
[13:12.21]Uh, it's thinking, okay, let's just go.
[13:13.59]Let's just try it out.
[13:15.71]Alright, so, we're going this way.
[13:17.85]Here's the first enemy of the game.
[13:19.52]Who's gonna get the first kill?
[13:21.46]Me!
[13:23.42]I think Mark did already.
[13:25.56]No, we've already, it's not Mark.
[13:29.76]Yeah, there are guns.
[13:31.32]Very limited ammo, apparently.
[13:35.19]I'm fighting like an elite.
[13:36.15]Yeah, there is like an elite over here.
[13:39.37]Oh, by the way, sorry for everybody's streams because it probably looks terrible considering that the bitrate probably is shitting the bed right now.
[13:46.82]Because we're in grass.
[13:50.60]At least it's not raining.
[13:51.74]Watch out, we got like some snakes.
[13:52.86]I just threw gas over there.
[13:57.74]I don't know where it is.
[13:58.96]Okay, it's in the grass somewhere.
[14:00.72]I don't know where though.
[14:05.53]Oh, I already have healing on.
[14:07.03]I'm already equipped.
[14:08.19]What the fuck was that?
[14:11.31]Alright, watch out, watch out.
[14:12.75]There's a jockey.
[14:13.61]Jockey.
[14:18.08]Somebody actually is jockeyed.
[14:24.44]Alright, is it weird to say that I can't even tell who an enemy is?
[14:27.34]Wait, is it?
[14:29.36]No, it's not.
[14:29.82]It's on recruit.
[14:33.77]Oh, well, the song is playing.
[14:35.79]That means that more monsters are on the way.
[14:45.13]Get a mark.
[14:50.33]Don't forget, you have ultimate abilities.
[14:52.55]Yeah, I guess that's true.
[14:54.09]I do.
[14:54.97]I do have ultimate abilities.
[14:56.07]You're right.
[14:58.31]I think I just gave everyone in the party crit.
[15:00.49]Oh, watch this.
[15:01.59]I didn't do anything.
[15:02.21]Never mind.
[15:09.18]Well, this is how you just group them up, right?
[15:15.83]It's just a Genji ult.
[15:18.33]There is so much happening right now.
[15:20.03]Alright, can I do my move?
[15:23.89]How do you activate your ability?
[15:25.27]I thought I made it something else.
[15:26.45]It's F. F is your ability.
[15:27.65]Is it?
[15:28.81]There it is, okay.
[15:29.31]Alright, I'm going to mute for a second so you don't have to listen to... Wait, what?
[15:34.71]Hold on.
[15:35.27]No, I see what you're saying.
[15:38.53]Yeah, I'm picking up what you're saying here.
[15:45.35]Probably should be... I only have three shots in the shotgun, really?
[15:49.58]That seems a little low.
[15:51.94]When did this come out?
[15:53.36]Oh, it... It did not.
[15:55.52]This is currently the closed beta.
[15:58.36]You have to pre-order the game.
[16:00.04]Well, there's one other way to get it.
[16:02.36]Some humble bundle, I think, included the beta.
[16:05.96]Something like that.
[16:06.74]But... Oh, Etalyx is still back here, but... We're good.
[16:11.47]There's loot in the game.
[16:12.29]At least the last one, there was loot.
[16:15.59]And it was a weird system where you had to roll dice.
[16:18.31]I'm not sure they kept it for this game.
[16:20.83]Maybe they did.
[16:23.59]But I was a big fan of the first one.
[16:26.40]And if the first one... The second one, I mean.
[16:28.16]Is any... Same or better as the first one, then of course I'm gonna like it.
[16:33.62]A lot of random shit in here.
[16:35.40]There's a real big guy over here.
[16:37.06]There's like medical supplies in here.
[16:39.64]You probably want to come outside.
[16:42.54]What is that?
[16:44.60]Hold on.
[16:45.64]There's a bunch of shit in here.
[16:46.50]Yeah, but out here there's a lot of stuff happening.
[16:50.52]Is somebody being eaten?
[16:53.55]Oh, wow.
[16:53.85]This is like a boss.
[16:55.31]Somebody's already dead.
[16:56.95]Wait.
[16:57.79]How did he get in here?
[16:58.47]What?
[16:59.27]He's in there with you.
[17:00.45]How did he get in there?
[17:02.36]I was just looking at him.
[17:04.94]Okay, well, we have to pay attention now.
[17:06.88]He's got me now.
[17:08.28]I have no more bullets.
[17:11.99]Guys?
[17:13.29]I'm gonna have to revive you.
[17:15.07]One of the two Marks might... No, I got you, I got you.
[17:17.03]Don't worry, Mark is backing us up.
[17:20.45]Mark's backing us up.
[17:22.07]Is there a limit on revives?
[17:23.78]Like, can you only be revived once in a campaign?
[17:25.68]It's probably something like Left 4 Dead, where you can probably only get revived a few times in one campaign.
[17:33.26]This is not a rat.
[17:34.18]That is true.
[17:36.22]Are you sure it's not a rat, though?
[17:37.64]It might not.
[17:38.44]It might not be a rat.
[17:39.05]What if it started as a rat?
[17:41.07]Then what, it was just... Done, like, the fucking medical signs on it?
[17:47.83]He seems to have a lot of health.
[17:50.05]Uh, he is a spawn of chaos.
[17:52.32]And it's probably the equivalent of a tank.
[17:54.22]Ow.
[17:55.10]I gotta, I gotta... Are you the one down?
[17:56.98]No, I'm currently... I just blocked that.
[18:01.41]Oh, I just blocked it!
[18:02.19]That means I'm looking good!
[18:02.93]Do you think we can pick up to throw at this guy?
[18:08.21]Maybe, I'm not sure.
[18:09.33]Oh, fuck.
[18:14.44]Alright, well, Mark is okay.
[18:15.70]What the fuck?
[18:16.68]Why?
[18:17.04]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[18:19.42]We might have severely underestimated this guy.
[18:23.08]I think that may be the case, yeah.
[18:26.40]What?
[18:26.94]Oh, I didn't block it.
[18:35.27]Okay, he got me.
[18:39.37]Just let him grab one of the bots.
[18:44.04]If you have any range, that would probably be a good time.
[18:46.98]Alright, he's dead.
[18:47.88]How do we loot his body?
[18:50.06]What did he drop?
[18:50.78]Did he drop any uniques?
[18:53.50]Okay, well, we just got him.
[18:54.78]Alright, come in here.
[18:55.42]There's a potion of strength, potion of speed, there's random stuff in here you should probably grab.
[19:03.93]Should have been the dwarf.
[19:06.85]Yeah, he has a gun, right?
[19:08.25]Or a bowgun?
[19:11.43]Look at the gore.
[19:13.63]This is a pretty gory game.
[19:15.51]Hey, thank you, too.
[19:18.71]MrFancy24 for the two bucks.
[19:20.20]Hi.
[19:21.40]AltoTrain, thanks for the one dollar.
[19:22.82]Hey, Jerma, my school workload has been over the top recently.
[19:25.24]My parents got on my nerves a bit.
[19:27.24]It's rad to have an escape in Skyrim and in your streams.
[19:30.64]What the fuck?
[19:32.00]Hey, help!
[19:35.46]Let's get the shit out of me.
[19:37.46]What?
[19:37.82]I thought that was you!
[19:39.42]I thought that was you!
[19:40.94]I thought that was just you!
[19:42.06]Why is this guy still alive?
[19:44.34]Alright, okay, anyways.
[19:45.94]Hold on, give me a minute.
[19:48.34]Hey, thanks a lot, man.
[19:49.20]I appreciate that.
[19:51.26]For a second, I thought you were saying this was Skyrim, but... Good luck with your work.
[19:56.40]Sorry that it's been a little tough for you.
[19:59.46]But... We're playing some Vermintide.
[20:01.62]Hopefully it's... Hopefully it's fun.
[20:05.39]Are you here?
[20:09.19]I'm not really sure.
[20:10.50]Kind of.
[20:11.14]Well, we're having some technical difficulties.
[20:13.30]Everyone's already dead, so.
[20:15.56]And they only follow me.
[20:18.42]Alright, reach the orchid.
[20:19.84]The orchard.
[20:20.94]Orchid.
[20:21.32]Make sure we're looking around here.
[20:25.56]There's bombs.
[20:28.44]Yeah, make sure somebody call the Orkin man.
[20:34.79]Do you have Orkin where you live?
[20:36.13]Okay, there's a bomb.
[20:39.50]Orkin?
[20:39.94]Do you have the Orkin man?
[20:44.80]I think so.
[20:47.76]I've got somebody that my local McDonald's has a roach killer right next to it.
[20:54.58]What is...
[20:58.21]Why is the ground on fire?
[20:59.61]I don't know.
[20:59.87]There was a move that guy did.
[21:02.49]That guy teleported over here and did a huge flame wreath.
[21:06.25]Oh, that guy's dead too.
[21:07.13]That was fucked up.
[21:08.62]I don't know why that happened.
[21:11.64]That was just an NPC that went over there.
[21:13.36]They didn't follow us.
[21:14.40]He just wandered over here.
[21:15.58]I need ammo.
[21:16.56]Oh, it's this guy.
[21:19.38]Yeah, see?
[21:19.70]There he is.
[21:19.98]That's the incendiary bomb guy.
[21:22.08]Nice.
[21:24.62]Why is it aiming at her?
[21:25.84]Oh, there you go.
[21:27.11]Apparently bombs are very powerful.
[21:29.15]Apparently.
[21:31.31]I hear loud sounds.
[21:33.75]Yes, I do.
[21:34.73]I'm drinking this.
[21:36.73]I have a bomb.
[21:38.43]Oh, why am I like shit-faced?
[21:43.98]Oh my god.
[21:45.28]Tiny corridors.
[21:49.84]We have to reach the orchard.
[21:53.58]These aren't rats.
[21:55.34]These are like mummies.
[21:58.06]Why are there mummies out here?
[21:59.60]God, watch out.
[22:02.10]Now there's rats.
[22:02.96]Okay, did you want rats?
[22:03.96]Because you got them.
[22:05.96]I love rats.
[22:06.62]Oh, boy.
[22:10.29]Who's dead?
[22:10.83]Pretty much everybody.
[22:13.85]That is true.
[22:15.05]It turns out, even the recruit difficulty... I think it's because we're not moving, probably.
[22:20.37]Maybe.
[22:20.74]What's on the ground here?
[22:22.20]If you stood in one place for too long, they would just send a horde.
[22:24.88]Yeah, we gotta get to the orchard.
[22:27.28]Let's get over there.
[22:29.70]Where is that?
[22:30.16]There is like a cart that is very welded.
[22:32.60]There is a lit up cart over there, that's true.
[22:37.50]This is Warhammer, that does make sense.
[22:40.36]That there'd be chaos.
[22:43.78]No Chaos Space Marines, though.
[22:45.30]Where are they?
[22:46.86]They should have made a 40k version of this game.
[22:48.78]No, they didn't.
[22:49.69]No, they shouldn't.
[22:50.19]They already did that, and the game was bad.
[22:51.47]You need gun stuff.
[22:53.41]There's ammo over here.
[22:55.09]I'm describing... Oh, they should... What was that?
[22:58.01]You good?
[22:58.57]I didn't realize the pitchfork could just pick you up and carry you away.
[23:02.36]Yeah, I got lamp oil here.
[23:05.66]Space Marine wasn't bad.
[23:06.54]No, no, no.
[23:06.82]But didn't they make a Space Marine, like, four-person survival Left 4 Dead game, and it was not good?
[23:13.72]Turns out you cannot shoot the explosive barrel out of your hands.
[23:16.32]You can't.
[23:16.64]I tried three times.
[23:17.42]No, well, watch out.
[23:18.12]I think these are NPCs.
[23:21.58]What gave it away?
[23:22.81]No, no, I mean, like, I thought they were, like, selling stuff.
[23:25.19]I think we can buy stuff from these guys.
[23:27.65]Yep.
[23:30.01]No, don't throw that over here.
[23:33.82]It doesn't even explode.
[23:34.98]I'm disappointed.
[23:35.54]I'm gonna save my... It doesn't explode?
[23:36.84]Yes, it has to.
[23:38.58]I shot it twice.
[23:43.33]What is it for?
[23:44.83]It's probably for bombs.
[23:48.77]I feel like I have... Yeah, I'm gonna use it.
[23:51.29]Just fuck it.
[23:52.85]We, like, need to use this now.
[23:53.85]Two people are down.
[23:54.39]Now there's gas on the ground.
[23:56.41]Why doesn't it do anything?
[23:57.71]There it is.
[23:58.81]Wow.
[24:00.00]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[24:01.20]I'm gonna die.
[24:02.24]I'm gonna die.
[24:02.96]I'm inside the middle of the fire.
[24:04.04]That's not good.
[24:06.94]They're everywhere, man.
[24:08.72]They're actually everywhere.
[24:13.37]What was that?
[24:14.79]Oh, that guy showed up again.
[24:15.69]The guy with the fire!
[24:19.38]Okay, yeah, it's just me and you now.
[24:21.28]Well, that's not surprising.
[24:23.38]Okay, um, okay.
[24:28.00]I guess they can perma-die.
[24:30.27]I guess they can.
[24:30.85]Alright, we got them.
[24:36.55]They're reviving each other.
[24:37.43]All good.
[24:41.19]One of them is full dead, so... Oh yeah, playing with bots!
[24:47.29]Playing with bots.
[24:49.31]You probably, if you have a potion, should use it.
[24:51.89]I have a... I don't even know what this is.
[24:54.12]I have a blue potion.
[24:55.44]It's purple, and the special meter's purple.
[24:58.50]We're gonna get to the boss and die.
[24:59.68]Well, I'm in one... What does the purple potion do?
[25:06.83]Do you have any idea?
[25:07.37]The blue one?
[25:07.99]The blue potion?
[25:12.22]What if it's like a buff?
[25:13.50]I don't want to just use it now.
[25:14.52]Pick on the rats.
[25:20.73]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[25:21.57]It's one of those scary rats.
[25:23.13]Well, yep, the scary rat got me too.
[25:25.31]Did we lose?
[25:27.21]Is that the end?
[25:27.95]It's up to the NPC at this point.
[25:29.47]Come on, Greg.
[25:30.47]Come on, Greg!
[25:31.91]Nice.
[25:32.61]No, no, no, you have to save me.
[25:35.43]Okay, he ran back and forth.
[25:37.93]I'm being taken to the rat lair at this point.
[25:41.79]Yeah, he could have lifted me up.
[25:43.49]Yes, I'm just being worshipped now by the rats.
[25:50.65]Come on!
[25:52.13]Is he- did he save you?
[25:53.05]He's still alive!
[25:53.77]How come I can't- I'm gonna die.
[25:55.27]No, wait, he's coming back!
[25:57.15]No, that's- that's- that's the bad guy.
[26:00.19]I'm- yeah, we lose.
[26:03.77]All he had to do, the NPC, was shoot either one of the rats that were carrying us.
[26:09.98]He had two options to save the game.
[26:13.30]And, uh... Alright, well, that's the first- first- that was the tutorial?
[26:18.85]Are we going to plan B from the very beginning of the game?
[26:23.47]Yeah, let's do it again.
[26:24.15]Come on.
[26:26.41]We can do this shit.
[26:27.55]We got two shitty bots.
[26:28.99]We're fine.
[26:29.39]We're going to be fine.
[26:32.52]Okay.
[26:32.68]Let's take a look.
[26:34.04]How far through that mission was it?
[26:37.40]Probably not that far.
[26:38.50]You were having computer problems.
[26:42.22]I still am.
[26:43.12]Oh, you still are.
[26:45.22]Are we returning to keep?
[26:49.02]Uh... I believe we are returning to keep.
[26:51.77]Yeah, I mean, we spent, like, a good portion of that, like, trying to make sure that you were technically okay, and you still aren't technically okay.
[26:57.07]I'll take the blame, don't worry.
[26:58.85]Well, I just want to make sure, like, we're at, you know... My point is, that was like a, let's get it and try it.
[27:03.82]You know what I mean?
[27:05.02]Now we know, it's time to rock and roll.
[27:06.66]You know what I'm saying?
[27:09.10]Maybe...
[27:11.12]When you don't have two more friends.
[27:15.78]Hey, listen, streaming's a lonely life, okay?
[27:18.70]You take on the life of a hermit, alright?
[27:21.61]But you become wise.
[27:24.03]You become very, very wise.
[27:25.95]Listen, let's not start with against the grain.
[27:27.71]Let's do the one at the top left.
[27:29.23]Alright, let's do the easy, easy, easy one.
[27:35.01]Let's do the one that's like,
[27:36.57]This is how you right-click to swing.
[27:40.43]Exit through the Bridge of Shadows.
[27:45.36]Well, it's literally just right here.
[27:47.22]No, it's not.
[27:47.94]I lied.
[27:53.46]Okay.
[27:54.20]Okay, let's do it.
[27:56.55]You can change player outlines to always on in the settings.
[27:59.67]Can you really?
[28:00.73]Did I turn it off?
[28:06.17]Let me make sure I didn't turn it off.
[28:08.47]This place looks cool.
[28:10.11]This reminds me of the first game.
[28:12.81]Let me turn this, see if I can turn that on.
[28:16.94]Where would that be?
[28:18.10]Camera, player outlines, on.
[28:35.17]Player outlines.
[28:36.19]Always on.
[28:39.57]Oh, there we go.
[28:40.61]Now we're cooking.
[28:42.11]Now we're talking.
[28:43.97]Etalyx, please turn this on.
[28:45.91]If you can hear me.
[28:47.95]Turn on player outlines always.
[28:50.06]Options.
[28:51.12]Player outlines always on.
[28:53.28]On gameplay?
[28:54.22]Yeah.
[28:54.78]To make it so you can actually determine.
[28:58.00]Mine are already on.
[28:59.98]No, do always on.
[29:01.88]Oh, there's another set.
[29:03.20]So it's not like we're not looking around like, wait, is that a monster?
[29:08.08]That's a good idea.
[29:09.02]Yeah.
[29:09.77]It's good to have on.
[29:10.69]Okay, everyone's neon green now.
[29:12.81]Yeah, that's good.
[29:16.05]We're just, like, really poorly lit on a green screen.
[29:20.31]Or somebody didn't do... Hey, come on.
[29:22.89]Let's get a good joke for our video editing friends out there.
[29:25.40]Somebody really didn't, like, do chroma key right here.
[29:28.02]You know what I mean?
[29:29.24]They didn't take out the edges, didn't feather the edges.
[29:31.88]You know, some of you guys, some of you video guys will be like, Why?
[29:35.50]Alright, let's go.
[29:39.93]That was bad.
[29:40.83]No, it wasn't.
[29:42.77]No, it wasn't.
[29:43.21]That was really fucking funny.
[29:45.69]Some of these video editing guys are going to laugh their ass off at that.
[29:49.31]The rest are going to go cringe.
[29:51.27]Doesn't even matter.
[29:54.57]At least like two people will think that was funny.
[29:56.45]Put a Gaussian blur on that.
[29:57.95]And then we're talking.
[29:59.98]Cringe!
[30:03.86]Watch out for loot.
[30:05.40]I'm ready.
[30:08.20]There's a health potion immediately.
[30:12.74]So you can only hold one.
[30:15.03]There are a lot less enemies so far on this level.
[30:17.77]So far, yeah.
[30:20.85]Find a way to the temple.
[30:25.33]I probably shouldn't be taking all the potions, but that's okay.
[30:28.42]I think you can only hold one, can't you?
[30:31.38]You can hold a health potion and then two others.
[30:35.96]Alright.
[30:36.56]We're in Franz Ericsson's Plaza.
[30:38.64]I believe we have to go this way.
[30:41.42]Why didn't we start with this mission?
[30:43.08]I don't know.
[30:45.68]Look at this.
[30:46.82]It's going so much better already.
[30:50.19]It's going great.
[30:57.52]Can I zoom?
[30:58.08]Whoa!
[30:58.52]Watch out for the... Okay, I got grabbed by a spear.
[31:01.64]Where are you?
[31:01.94]From behind.
[31:02.70]I got hooked around the head.
[31:05.75]And I'm getting, like, gassed.
[31:07.89]It's a guy with a gas flamethrower.
[31:09.67]Yes, I can't get to you because he's literally pushing me away.
[31:11.80]I'm sorry, I got saved.
[31:15.32]I took a lot of damage, though.
[31:20.50]That's kind of cool looking.
[31:21.24]Alright.
[31:22.89]Well, that was painful.
[31:26.01]Let's try this again.
[31:27.89]Up here.
[31:29.91]Watch it.
[31:31.75]I feel like Bowlady probably is really fun.
[31:34.80]Especially considering that... Bowlady.
[31:37.70]Bowlady!
[31:38.66]Bowling is really fun!
[31:40.46]I love going to the lanes.
[31:45.32]Playing Candlepin.
[31:47.47]Alright, I'm just going and throwing it in there.
[31:50.83]Is that gonna explode?
[31:56.69]You've become the facto leader.
[31:57.85]Like, what does this do?
[31:59.69]Oh my fucking god.
[32:01.25]Seriously, like, I've picked it up.
[32:03.33]Hey, it was very clearly lit.
[32:05.37]Okay, like a firecracker just, like, tipped over, like a Roman candle tipped over and aimed at all the people at the barbecue and somebody just freaked out and ran and tried to pick it up.
[32:13.74]Oh shit, no, hold on!
[32:15.02]I gotta turn, like, drunk Uncle Frank just went to go pick up the Roman candle.
[32:20.09]Oh no, it's aiming at the barbecue!
[32:22.41]Turn it around, quick!
[32:25.35]I got a potion back here for you.
[32:27.43]You want to use the one you got?
[32:28.31]I mean, how much is his heal?
[32:31.39]Pretty much the full, I think.
[32:32.53]Yeah, I'll use it.
[32:41.74]Open the port, Cullis.
[32:43.86]Anything this big with a name, you're going to have a boss fight here.
[32:49.48]There's definitely going to be one of those tanks here.
[32:54.71]guaranteed I can 100 guarantee that alright so if you're wrong let's take a bet alright what are we doing for betting you want to bet stuff here now uh if you're wrong and there is not a boss fight here then you have to play with a controller for the next mission oh god no I don't want to take that bet that sucks
[33:21.48]Because then we're just gonna lose.
[33:24.60]I will make us lose this game over and over again.
[33:27.44]You sure you don't want to take the controller back?
[33:30.76]I'm gonna turn this.
[33:32.44]Alright, if you lose, you have to turn your sensitivity up double what it is now on mouse.
[33:36.80]How about if I lose, I'll go, fuck, and we'll start over.
[33:39.48]This is just survive.
[33:42.51]Now, does a horde of enemies constitute... I don't think it constitutes a boss fight as such.
[33:47.41]That's debatable.
[33:49.39]What about the Cathedral of the Deep?
[33:51.47]It needs to be at least, like, a tanky-looking enemy.
[33:54.33]I don't know, man.
[33:54.91]This is the cathedral.
[33:57.37]Boss.
[34:01.91]What's with my audio?
[34:02.63]I can't hear anything.
[34:04.57]Don't worry.
[34:04.97]I saved you.
[34:09.94]They get behind you really quickly.
[34:12.36]That's because they jump from the roof.
[34:14.24]Yes, they do.
[34:15.18]Whew.
[34:20.09]Damn it!
[34:21.15]Oh my god, they're fucking everywhere.
[34:28.63]So if they have armor on, you need to use the hold button.
[34:33.07]A super swing, yep.
[34:34.59]A super swing, yep.
[34:39.23]We probably should get like... Whoa!
[34:40.95]Okay, there's a guy here.
[34:42.05]There's actually like cathedral people here.
[34:43.93]Oh my god, I'm in trouble.
[34:44.79]Cathedral people?
[34:46.07]They got like suits on.
[34:47.25]The guy's in the suits.
[34:49.41]Yes, they do.
[34:50.03]Oh my lord, I'm dead again.
[34:52.85]These guys are here for the marriage ceremony.
[34:55.97]Are we supposed to push this thing?
[34:56.82]I think no, I think we just have to survive.
[34:58.94]This looks like a thing we're gonna have to push.
[35:02.08]We need to have names for these things, man.
[35:05.52]Oh shit.
[35:07.59]We have to have names for the special infected.
[35:09.66]Whatever, you know, whatever we're gonna call them.
[35:11.30]So, okay.
[35:12.70]Here's an idea.
[35:13.82]Yeah?
[35:14.60]Maybe the one that shoots the green could be, like, maybe a spitter.
[35:18.04]Spitter?
[35:18.60]Okay.
[35:19.22]Okay.
[35:20.37]I like it so far.
[35:21.43]And maybe the really large one with a lot of health points could be the tank.
[35:24.99]The tank?
[35:25.31]Okay.
[35:26.49]Okay, I'm with you so far.
[35:29.87]They do have names.
[35:30.65]Yeah, but we don't know those names.
[35:32.40]Alright, we got a blight stormer coming in on the western gate.
[35:36.32]He's like trying to talk in Blightstormer.
[35:39.34]Oh, okay.
[35:41.07]And he's dead.
[35:42.15]He's dead.
[35:42.53]Wait, are you sure he's dead?
[35:44.89]He might have just dropped his book.
[35:46.67]He's not dead.
[35:47.49]In fact, he's not dead.
[35:49.83]Oh, no.
[35:51.99]It's my turn.
[35:53.05]You told me he was dead.
[35:54.35]Help me out here, guys.
[35:55.38]What am I supposed to do?
[35:56.38]No, shit.
[35:57.08]No, don't do it again.
[35:58.76]Alright.
[36:01.68]We're figuring it out.
[36:02.94]We're figuring it out.
[36:03.82]I'm going to hide.
[36:04.42]It draws you in.
[36:05.82]It doesn't let you go.
[36:06.64]What are you supposed to do?
[36:10.22]Wait, wait, he's coming over here.
[36:11.94]Let's get away from the tornado.
[36:13.16]Shh, don't tell anybody I took this.
[36:20.20]I've got like a giant med kit.
[36:21.84]I don't know if I should use it.
[36:22.76]Do I have to shoot into that?
[36:23.80]Is there anything to throw over there?
[36:30.18]What's the trick?
[36:30.82]There's got to be a play here.
[36:31.76]I mean, there's a trick.
[36:33.42]Maybe shoot the gas?
[36:35.04]He's up top.
[36:36.30]Okay, so...
[36:38.60]Maybe you have to find him on the top ropes and shoot him off?
[36:42.02]Maybe.
[36:44.05]Where is he now?
[36:44.79]There he is.
[36:47.93]Nice.
[36:49.43]He's coming back down.
[36:50.13]He dropped his book.
[36:50.83]What's your ranged weapon?
[36:51.71]Is it like a shotgun?
[36:52.53]It's just a shotgun, yeah.
[36:53.51]I can't, like, zoom it in or anything.
[36:55.72]I think that's it.
[36:57.20]He dropped his book.
[36:58.36]Don't read that passage!
[36:59.68]What is it?
[37:00.04]Let me see what it says.
[37:00.74]Necronomicon.
[37:02.50]There's a bunch of, like, child's drawings in there.
[37:06.44]Alright, let's go.
[37:07.16]It's on the wall before we get collapsed on.
[37:10.01]Pretty sure it's like a dick.
[37:13.37]What?
[37:13.53]I saw a dick.
[37:14.47]What are you talking about?
[37:15.57]In the book.
[37:17.01]It drew a penis.
[37:18.37]Excuse me.
[37:18.69]Excuse me.
[37:20.08]It's right there.
[37:21.04]Go back and look.
[37:21.74]No, excuse me.
[37:23.28]It's probably like a developer joke.
[37:24.70]Oh, I thought you were going to say I thought it was like a developer's dick.
[37:28.64]It's probably...
[37:31.00]I'm like, wait, why would they do that?
[37:32.80]What are you talking about?
[37:33.84]He drew his own penis.
[37:35.80]He put a Polaroid of his penis in the game.
[37:37.92]I dare you to try to step off on one of these floors.
[37:40.28]Are you daring me?
[37:41.60]Too late.
[37:42.24]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out!
[37:46.46]Don't get sucked in the vacuum in this room.
[37:55.05]Cool.
[37:55.57]Nice.
[37:56.03]Watch it!
[38:03.50]I hear them, but I don't see them.
[38:05.24]That scared the hell out of me.
[38:06.26]Oh, no, no, no.
[38:06.58]There are a lot of people in here.
[38:11.94]Just keep moving.
[38:12.40]That's the name of the game.
[38:15.64]True.
[38:16.30]It is going a lot easier when we just... Okay, they're dropping from on top again.
[38:19.22]Yes, they are on the ceiling.
[38:28.28]Right in the chest.
[38:31.96]Okay, keep going.
[38:35.55]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[38:37.05]Don't aggro.
[38:38.23]Don't aggro the Centurion rats.
[38:40.95]Nope.
[38:43.03]Unless you want to throw this at them first.
[38:46.11]Not a bad idea.
[38:48.23]They're definitely going to fight.
[38:50.53]I mean, well, yeah.
[38:51.39]We can bait them into... Alright, take them down here.
[38:55.06]What's going on over here?
[38:55.80]I think there's a couple of spawns back here.
[38:59.74]Alright, let's go.
[39:02.51]So where are they?
[39:05.39]They are kind of just walking away from me.
[39:08.09]I think they're just on patrol up here.
[39:09.57]Yeah, I would drop that thing down and shoot it when they walk across it.
[39:12.41]It might be back on the bottom floor.
[39:15.33]I don't know where they are.
[39:16.23]What a genius plan.
[39:18.83]Put it on the ground and shoot it when they walk across it.
[39:24.17]Oh, hold on.
[39:28.35]This is my bad.
[39:29.29]Whoa!
[39:31.19]I'm coming.
[39:31.91]I got too far away from the... Oh, that's going to explode.
[39:33.79]That's going to explode.
[39:34.33]That's going to explode.
[39:38.60]Why is this... Really?
[39:39.92]What the fuck?
[39:41.90]I shot him like three times.
[39:45.04]Thank you for saving me.
[39:46.38]You're welcome.
[39:47.14]Oh, you're my life.
[39:50.24]Okay.
[39:52.32]So... Oh, hey, look.
[39:53.26]It's Mark.
[39:54.70]It's the two Marks.
[39:56.81]They decided to help out.
[39:59.47]Potion of strength.
[40:03.15]Uh, Chaser... ammo.
[40:06.14]Who's blowing the Warhorn?
[40:08.60]Probably the game.
[40:09.34]I thought Warhammer was in the future.
[40:15.28]There's like Fantasy Warhammer and then 40k, right?
[40:19.27]Ah, behind us.
[40:21.91]This is end times.
[40:22.95]This is Warhammer end times.
[40:28.17]Did you knock that whole horde over with just one push?
[40:31.13]Uh, that is my special move.
[40:34.53]I go and I buff everybody's health and I push everybody back.
[40:39.53]It's super useful.
[40:43.85]I love just swinging across and hitting fucking 25 people.
[40:48.91]Are you dead?
[40:52.52]I was dead.
[40:53.18]Now I'm fine.
[40:54.42]Must have just gotten hit by a stray NPC.
[40:57.14]But I think if I die again, I'm dead.
[40:58.86]But I have a health potion.
[41:01.55]It's really satisfying to swing through like 10 people at the same time.
[41:04.58]Yeah, that's why I'm kind of considering changing class because I have like a little... I like the poke weapon, but that's what I do is poke.
[41:13.20]Yeah, End Times, there's like three different or four different... Yeah, they're really milking that universe.
[41:26.21]I think they're the same universe.
[41:27.19]I think they're just different time periods.
[41:30.11]Yeah.
[41:31.77]Do you have any health potions?
[41:33.11]One of our dumb bots needs to pick one of these up.
[41:35.15]Wait, hold on.
[41:35.49]I got an idea.
[41:37.30]I did have a health potion.
[41:38.64]Alright, come here.
[41:39.42]How do I give health potion?
[41:41.46]There's probably like a drop button.
[41:44.14]There we go.
[41:44.68]Alright, now take that.
[41:45.62]I thought the regular war hammer wasn't in times.
[41:48.48]I thought it was just...
[41:50.26]Is it not?
[41:51.34]I thought it was just there's Warhammer and then there's Warhammer 40k.
[41:54.46]Which is 40,000 years later.
[41:58.48]Yes.
[41:59.50]Maybe they're all in the same universe.
[42:03.85]I think the rats are all dead by the time 40k comes around.
[42:09.11]Maybe.
[42:09.63]Because we're the ones that killed them.
[42:13.31]So, wait, are we the bad guys?
[42:15.97]We might be the bad guys.
[42:17.45]I mean, they do have these giant stone fortresses that they made, and we're just kind of walking around in.
[42:25.22]I got a health potion?
[42:27.16]Yeah, I do.
[42:32.76]So, I'm going to say we go through this door.
[42:36.92]Move along the wall, says the game.
[42:38.88]This looks like a wall.
[42:44.51]It's a very pretty game.
[42:46.27]Yeah.
[42:48.19]This map is not nearly as annoying from a technical standpoint.
[42:54.96]Okay.
[42:55.30]Are we supposed to jump this?
[42:58.40]I was blocking out.
[42:58.96]I do not think we're supposed to jump that.
[43:00.44]Oh, that guy's got a machine gun.
[43:01.52]Yes, he does.
[43:02.00]I'm hiding.
[43:02.34]I'm hiding behind the wall.
[43:03.70]That guy down there does not look like he's going to be... Ow.
[43:09.76]I think we go down.
[43:11.48]There's the rattling gun.
[43:12.36]Somebody was looking for that.
[43:13.64]The rattling gun.
[43:14.96]This thing's gonna stand up.
[43:16.64]I love it.
[43:18.44]Watch out behind.
[43:23.91]Oh my god, really?
[43:24.79]He's just running by.
[43:26.29]He's just... God, give me a break.
[43:30.35]Where are you?
[43:31.03]Oh.
[43:31.67]Oh, he's coming down.
[43:32.35]He got me, like, underneath the chin.
[43:33.73]Where is he?
[43:35.41]He's dead.
[43:36.01]He's dead.
[43:36.27]He's dead.
[43:43.53]Back it up.
[43:44.77]Alright, this... Getting a little sketchy and hairy down here.
[43:48.35]It is getting hairy.
[43:52.19]Oh, back up.
[43:53.11]See?
[43:54.09]Ooh!
[43:55.23]Ooh, too many.
[43:56.95]Ooh, too many.
[43:57.67]Party crits.
[43:59.43]Oh, party crits?
[44:03.43]Those are my favorite party.
[44:05.21]Pretty big difference, actually.
[44:06.45]That's my favorite thing to do at a party.
[44:08.73]Is get free crits.
[44:09.71]Pin the tail on the donkey.
[44:10.91]Oh.
[44:17.16]That guy went blind.
[44:25.56]Alright.
[44:26.26]So far, so good.
[44:27.88]We have to go and activate the crane on the top middle, so we need to just kind of move until we get all the way over there, I think.
[44:38.87]By the way, blue potions are for speed.
[44:42.47]It'll make you go much faster.
[44:44.03]I mean, we probably fight them on the way.
[44:47.67]Is the no streaming this game not a thing anymore?
[44:49.70]The NDA of Vermintide 2 has been lifted.
[44:53.90]Correct.
[44:54.74]It even says as much when you turn on the closed beta.
[44:58.08]It says NDA no longer in effect.
[45:00.66]There's a ladder over here.
[45:01.42]This is now allowed to stream.
[45:05.42]Only a few levels, but it's still able to play in stream.
[45:09.25]Gas thrower.
[45:10.13]You got him?
[45:19.76]Very nice.
[45:20.28]Watch out for that thing.
[45:21.00]Do we have to be standing on that?
[45:24.26]Looks like a cannon.
[45:25.24]I'm thinking we're about to blast something open.
[45:28.09]Nice.
[45:29.85]Watch out for one of those skewers.
[45:40.50]Do we have a ragdoll issue over here?
[45:43.36]That was some Battlefield 3 shit.
[45:46.54]It's still happening for me.
[45:47.86]Is it?
[45:48.04]He's sinking through the floor.
[45:49.16]Oh, he's gone.
[45:49.68]He's gone.
[45:51.30]He just vanished.
[45:52.73]Cannon, no text assigned.
[45:54.39]Uh-oh.
[45:56.33]That's his placeholder.
[45:59.11]Good job.
[45:59.91]You are wielding the mini cannon, so it's only fitting that you're the one that gets to blast this open.
[46:04.93]Yeah.
[46:05.47]Alright, we got a purple potion.
[46:10.39]Potion of concentration.
[46:13.31]It's probably... You can have the speed potion.
[46:15.83]You already have one.
[46:16.41]Well, I'm just going to use it and take it.
[46:17.41]Just use it.
[46:20.13]Now, how fast do you go?
[46:21.43]If you got to go fast, you know what else is blue that goes fast?
[46:23.72]Don't say it.
[46:24.70]Wait, I'm not going faster.
[46:27.10]I'm walking at normal speed.
[46:29.68]Wait, what did you think I was going to say?
[46:30.74]I don't know.
[46:34.58]I was... I was... Look, I gotta do it again.
[46:37.02]I was talking about the Roadrunner.
[46:38.95]What'd you think I was doing?
[46:39.57]Now I'm going faster.
[46:40.25]I wasn't going faster before.
[46:47.13]We gotta probably move through this fairly quickly.
[46:54.08]Well... Haha, funny one.
[46:57.00]Uh... So... Come on, it was kind of funny.
[47:01.58]Um...
[47:03.40]May have encountered an issue.
[47:05.06]What'd you do?
[47:05.54]What happened?
[47:07.38]What happened?
[47:08.30]Stay calm.
[47:09.26]What do you mean stay calm?
[47:11.09]What happened?
[47:13.95]Whatever you do, don't look at my character in the game.
[47:17.59]I got disconnected.
[47:24.19]Did you crash?
[47:24.65]Yes.
[47:24.77]Oh, no.
[47:30.41]I'm back in the... But since you're still in the game, I think I might be able to just join off of you.
[47:34.42]I ain't on no mission no more.
[47:37.44]Is it dead?
[47:38.08]Oh.
[47:38.78]So it closed the hole.
[47:39.56]It closed the mission.
[47:43.46]Right.
[47:44.46]Right.
[47:45.31]Listen, anytime Jerma and I stream a game together, this happens every time.
[47:57.13]It kinda does.
[47:58.33]It's alright though.
[47:59.94]It's alright.
[48:00.62]Now we're even more prepared.
[48:03.08]Beta is beta, it's true.
[48:04.62]And this is more beta than most, however...
[48:08.22]The game does full launch in two weeks.
[48:10.72]I'm going to have to cut you off here for like a minute.
[48:12.54]Give me like five minutes.
[48:13.86]I'll be right back.
[48:14.56]I will give you some minutes.
[48:15.45]Give me like two minutes.
[48:17.41]I'll be right back.
[48:19.53]Somebody just gave $100.
[48:22.09]It was Polo Juice.
[48:22.95]Thanks for the $100.
[48:24.21]And they say, no donation attached.
[48:28.99]No donation assigned in code.
[48:32.57]Thank you so much, Polo Juice.
[48:33.72]Appreciate it, dude.
[48:38.98]Thank you.
[48:39.42]That's $100.
[48:41.58]And yes, this is a beta.
[48:43.98]We are currently experiencing the beta.
[48:47.58]I was just starting to have some fun there, too.
[48:51.04]But Polo Juice... 10,000 bits.
[48:55.99]No joke understood.
[48:57.15]Wait, what do you mean no joke?
[48:58.21]No donation assigned.
[48:59.23]Yeah, well, that was a good joke.
[49:00.67]That was a good donation joke.
[49:03.88]code that is code what what else is that alright while we're here I'm gonna go through a lot of these at the end but uh schmeck thank you schmeck for the 150. this is my first time giving bits on Twitch anyway just wanted to say I enjoy your streams thank you thank you schmeck appreciate it hydra725 thanks for the one dollar a sandwich walks into a bar the bar just says sorry we don't serve food here
[49:35.23]Why is it that you guys have been sending jokes.com jokes to the stream?
[49:40.57]I don't know.
[49:41.72]But thank you.
[49:42.94]Alright.
[49:43.14]So what do you want to do here?
[49:43.96]You want me to join you?
[49:44.70]You want to join me?
[49:47.26]I'll join you since I crashed.
[49:49.60]Okay.
[49:49.86]Hold on.
[49:51.86]Hold on.
[49:52.42]Let me get that.
[49:53.58]Whatever I need to do here.
[49:57.50]So you join off me.
[49:59.94]You should be able to join off me, right?
[50:02.38]Yeah, I just joined off you.
[50:04.10]I'm thinking about changing characters.
[50:06.54]Yeah, I like... You know what?
[50:08.68]I'm going to try the... I'm going to try the bow.
[50:12.83]The bow seems fun.
[50:15.15]Fire a true flight volley seeking out enemies in Carolyn's path.
[50:19.55]And I regenerate health over time.
[50:20.99]Double ammo capacity, no range damage falloff.
[50:24.15]And I can zoom in.
[50:24.59]It seems like a mostly bow class, because you get like 52 arrows.
[50:28.83]Yeah, you get a lot.
[50:31.21]I want to try it.
[50:31.81]Sounds fun.
[50:32.23]And you get a little dagger, too.
[50:35.78]Yeah, she looks like she's fun.
[50:37.82]You going to try the flame walker?
[50:41.08]I don't know, because I feel like I die a lot, and this probably is a squishy class.
[50:45.56]Probably both squishy classes.
[50:47.65]Alright, well I'm going to start the mission.
[50:49.44]You want to do this?
[50:50.40]Oh wait, are we going back to sad?
[50:52.28]What are we doing?
[50:53.12]Quick play story mode?
[50:53.74]What are we going to do?
[50:55.92]Um... You want to go to the middle one?
[50:57.24]Just so that's like, you know, we've seen them all for like the first, you know what I'm saying?
[51:00.96]Yeah, that would make sense.
[51:01.90]Then we can go back and actually try and like finish them.
[51:04.54]Okay, so we're going to mission Athel Yunlu.
[51:11.56]Right?
[51:12.54]I'll try the dwarf for one.
[51:15.03]So then how do we start this?
[51:17.33]Recruit, right?
[51:21.19]You just go to the book.
[51:22.55]Should I just do public game?
[51:25.96]That's what I was asking if you wanted to do earlier.
[51:28.22]Fuck it, who cares?
[51:31.00]You want to do the thing where...
[51:34.86]Which thing do you want to do?
[51:35.98]You tell me.
[51:36.72]Well, let's just queue for like a public game, you know, whatever.
[51:39.68]Just get two people.
[51:41.57]Just so we don't have like the two bots dragging us down like an anvil.
[51:45.89]Yeah, so what I was asking was, do you want to do the thing, the other thing?
[51:50.37]Do you want to do the thing, the other thing?
[51:53.13]I'm going to say no, because... Okay, the thing I'm talking about is the thing where we make a public game and then let whoever joins first get in.
[52:03.60]Oh, I mean, you want to do that?
[52:07.00]I guess we could do that.
[52:09.62]Won't our, like, server get, like, DDoSed, though?
[52:12.94]With, like, a bunch of people trying to join?
[52:14.66]Let's do it.
[52:15.45]Fuck it.
[52:16.15]Alright.
[52:17.47]You know how to do that?
[52:18.07]You want to do it?
[52:20.71]Uh, yeah, I'll do it.
[52:21.81]Alright, so what do we want to do here?
[52:23.99]So, you want to make the game?
[52:27.05]I don't know, like, how we... What do we just... Hey, this is the name, this is the password.
[52:31.36]Good luck.
[52:31.74]Is that what we're going to do?
[52:36.94]Sorry, I was picking my... Okay, I'll do it.
[52:38.36]I'm taking care of it.
[52:38.85]So, you're going to put, like, a name and password.
[52:41.31]Public.
[52:42.55]You're going to do public.
[52:45.05]Yes.
[52:45.43]I'm going to do public.
[52:48.99]And wouldn't that just put us in the lobby where anybody can join?
[52:51.92]I guess.
[52:52.82]So, wait.
[52:53.26]Are you naming the server?
[52:56.07]Oh, you want to go to the second mission?
[52:57.89]Do the second mission and name it like dog farts or something so everyone here knows that's what it is.
[53:02.61]I don't think there's not a name.
[53:03.99]They're just going to have to look for it.
[53:04.97]Oh, they're just going to have to find it.
[53:07.00]It's going to say who's hosting and they can sort by host.
[53:10.32]Okay.
[53:11.36]I think.
[53:11.90]And then they should be able to just join.
[53:13.52]Alright.
[53:14.38]I guess.
[53:16.10]Okay.
[53:16.68]What is my name on Steam right now?
[53:19.13]Greg okay, so that if I'm hosting it.
[53:21.60]It'll just be Etalyx, so it'd be pretty easy to find alright Go for it.
[53:24.36]Let's do it story mode public second mission.
[53:27.48]Good luck public play Okay, I'm ready Are we waiting for here?
[53:33.04]We go except just we just sit here?
[53:35.76]Until two people join then whenever we're ready we go into the waystone like in the blue force field Okay, so we're now we're waiting right now for two people to join correct The game is public and available to join
[53:49.63]Oh!
[53:49.89]Wait a minute!
[53:50.91]Here we go!
[53:51.81]Gloval?
[53:53.15]We've got somebody already!
[53:56.82]This is probably not even somebody from the stream.
[53:58.40]This is probably... It's just gonna be like a random person.
[54:01.62]Who has no idea.
[54:02.56]This is gonna be fun.
[54:03.32]Let me double check.
[54:04.40]There we go.
[54:04.96]It's already done.
[54:05.44]We're good.
[54:05.68]We're good.
[54:07.48]Auntie Belle and Gloval are both in the game.
[54:10.04]Am I on push-to-talk?
[54:11.10]Probably not.
[54:11.40]We don't even need to be talking.
[54:12.68]I am.
[54:13.62]We don't need to communicate.
[54:17.15]Somebody was just like, yes, I've been waiting for this.
[54:19.36]I was hoping they'd lose twice in a row.
[54:21.20]Yeah, they both came in at the same time.
[54:22.42]To be fair, though, the second one wasn't a loss.
[54:25.00]Yeah.
[54:25.84]The second one wasn't a loss.
[54:27.50]I took an L, but we didn't lose.
[54:29.40]Yeah.
[54:31.20]To be fair.
[54:33.82]To be fair.
[54:35.44]To be fair.
[54:37.78]Alright, I think we're ready to go.
[54:41.32]Wow, there's some secrets over here.
[54:43.46]Wow.
[54:44.93]I think we're ready to get going.
[54:46.43]Oh, okay.
[54:46.75]I'm coming.
[54:47.33]Hey, guys.
[54:47.77]Welcome.
[54:48.51]Thanks for joining us.
[54:51.01]Hey, welcome to the stream.
[54:52.23]You're both muted.
[54:54.52]And you can't hear us.
[54:56.18]So communication is key.
[54:58.82]Can't wait.
[54:59.44]It is the most important thing.
[55:05.30]I'm ready.
[55:07.26]Now I'm, like, excited.
[55:12.66]They probably have no idea who we are.
[55:14.62]Probably.
[55:15.16]I'm not going to assume that they are watching the stream, but if they are, hey, welcome!
[55:18.50]Welcome to the stream, dude!
[55:19.24]Let's take out the bow.
[55:25.24]I like this place already.
[55:26.06]I like the forest.
[55:28.42]It would be nice if we could complete a mission.
[55:30.26]It would be pretty cool.
[55:31.76]Yes, that would be.
[55:32.52]That is the first step.
[55:33.50]You know, this is the sampler platter.
[55:35.84]We've downloaded the beta and we've sampled all the maps so far.
[55:38.36]We need to locate this thing.
[55:44.57]Oh, potion.
[55:46.18]Ammo.
[55:49.80]So which one are you?
[55:50.68]You're the archer?
[55:51.76]I'm the archer.
[55:52.30]Alright, I'm the dwarf now.
[55:58.76]And this is the rat forest.
[56:00.18]Oh, this is fun.
[56:02.32]Oh, this is fun.
[56:03.80]This is fun, dude.
[56:04.86]This is fun.
[56:05.74]Just keep saying it until it's true.
[56:06.98]This is fun.
[56:09.37]You'll make it so.
[56:11.03]You are what you eat, after all.
[56:13.46]Oh, I was having too much fun.
[56:14.70]I didn't go with you guys.
[56:18.18]Okay.
[56:19.18]Fun.
[56:19.76]You can have fun over there.
[56:20.72]We can have fun over here.
[56:21.24]Don't worry.
[56:21.52]It's alright.
[56:21.84]I'm having plenty of fun.
[56:22.76]Got that guy.
[56:23.26]I'm having so much fun, I'm seeing double.
[56:28.89]Are you?
[56:29.87]Yeah.
[56:30.85]We probably need to be careful here.
[56:33.31]Oh, shit.
[56:33.63]Gas rat.
[56:34.75]He teleported.
[56:35.33]Where is he?
[56:36.73]What the fuck?
[56:40.71]There was a special infected over here somewhere.
[56:43.76]You good?
[56:44.08]You got him?
[56:44.58]Yeah.
[56:44.76]There's, like, healing all over the place over here.
[56:47.36]Well, none of us have taken damage because of our two professional gamers that we hired.
[56:52.06]Did we hire two pro gamers?
[56:55.78]Nice.
[56:56.61]They work for free, too.
[57:01.25]Oops.
[57:06.89]He's at pretty much half health.
[57:11.06]What character are you playing as?
[57:12.47]I'm the dwarf.
[57:14.69]I want to try the special here.
[57:18.67]Whoa, easy.
[57:21.27]Easy.
[57:22.23]That's a lot of fire.
[57:25.66]Nice, nice.
[57:27.24]Archer's up on top.
[57:28.74]Is that what's supposed to be done?
[57:30.38]Very much behind us.
[57:35.97]What did I just do?
[57:36.47]Oh, did you jump down?
[57:40.55]She said comedy, I like this character.
[57:46.96]So I guess that's a homing shot?
[57:48.22]Behind us, behind us, behind us.
[57:51.78]There are lots of people here.
[57:55.57]What the fuck is that?
[57:56.55]What is going on right now?
[57:58.03]There's a hail of green laser fire going over our heads right now.
[58:01.33]Oh god, this is not good.
[58:03.97]Who's the dwarf?
[58:04.49]You're the dwarf?
[58:10.05]I might be stuck back here.
[58:11.91]Yeah.
[58:15.81]No, I got grabbed by the spear person.
[58:19.02]We're all having some difficulties here.
[58:20.70]Oh, no.
[58:21.16]We're going to lose right now.
[58:23.02]No, we're good.
[58:26.08]Saved your life.
[58:27.24]And this guy saved my life.
[58:31.94]Who's still down?
[58:32.58]Alright, we're fine.
[58:39.24]Oh, this is the character from Brave.
[58:42.32]She has a Scottish accent and she has a bow and arrow.
[58:44.00]That means she's brave.
[58:44.88]And she probably has red hair.
[58:46.80]Does she?
[58:47.30]Do I have red hair?
[58:47.78]Uh, where are you?
[58:52.20]Oh.
[58:55.43]Oh, that's a big guy.
[58:57.21]In armor.
[59:03.67]I can't, like, see.
[59:05.13]Cover in the rear.
[59:10.25]Right in the head.
[59:10.77]Nice.
[59:11.87]I need ammo.
[59:15.79]Need ammo.
[59:19.01]No, that was a long time ago.
[59:20.47]We can't make that joke right now.
[59:22.57]You just did.
[59:23.09]I said, I need ammo.
[59:25.43]You said, I need ammo.
[59:26.73]That is it.
[59:27.17]Why is that guy blue?
[59:30.23]Because I marked them, I think.
[59:33.19]If I shoot somebody, then what happens?
[59:37.93]I don't know.
[59:38.35]How do you see your character stuff?
[59:42.48]I was going to shoot it, but decided not to.
[59:43.86]So I'm going to pick it up.
[59:47.90]No, no, no, no, no!
[59:49.40]Get it out of here!
[59:49.94]Get it out of here!
[59:50.32]Get the bomb out of here!
[59:51.10]You should have thrown it backwards.
[59:57.78]I was hoping there was going to be rats down there.
[59:59.30]They were going to walk over here.
[60:01.30]Gas.
[60:05.62]Where is he?
[60:09.16]Where's the gas rat?
[60:16.87]Somebody bumped me.
[60:20.11]Proceed through the wilds.
[60:28.34]I'm gonna hold on to this until I need it.
[60:33.92]Where are you?
[60:37.10]I'm just the dwarf.
[60:39.44]Oh.
[60:40.86]What about it?
[60:41.42]I don't know.
[60:42.68]I was just curious where you were.
[60:45.39]You trying to accuse me of not staying with the team?
[60:51.81]Oh, you mean like me?
[60:53.11]Like you?
[60:54.55]Sorry, I was too busy.
[60:55.65]I was doing duck hunt.
[60:56.89]I was having fun.
[61:04.60]That's a noise that I don't know if I like that noise.
[61:07.74]Yeah, that's the noise that we're still trying to learn what it means.
[61:10.94]I think it just means here comes a bunch of people.
[61:17.16]instantly saved you.
[61:18.90]That wasn't me.
[61:20.68]Oh, it was that guy.
[61:21.74]What did I mean, you?
[61:24.48]Glove all.
[61:25.08]So does that just pierce?
[61:26.72]What is it?
[61:27.08]Is it homing?
[61:28.48]Oh!
[61:31.58]What the fuck, man?
[61:33.22]What is that?
[61:34.64]That's my special move.
[61:35.92]It's a smoke bomb.
[61:37.10]That's cool.
[61:37.56]That knocks enemies back and hides you while you stay inside of it.
[61:45.80]Oh my lord.
[61:54.64]Fuck.
[61:55.40]There's so many.
[61:55.80]I'm noticing they're dying a lot faster with four full people.
[62:00.18]Yeah, this is an actual video game now.
[62:02.34]Yes, there was not a video game before.
[62:08.79]Rattling gunner.
[62:10.59]Don't know where he is.
[62:12.97]He's somewhere.
[62:13.73]He's behind us.
[62:17.25]He's behind.
[62:18.59]I can't get a good shot at him.
[62:21.24]Can't get a good shot at him.
[62:22.08]Nice.
[62:22.92]Nice.
[62:24.43]Thank you for marking him.
[62:27.71]It's a double marksman tactic.
[62:33.40]Whoops.
[62:34.68]This marksman needs some more practice.
[62:36.84]I'm going to run out of ammo if I'm not more conservative here.
[62:43.97]Oh, come on.
[62:47.07]He's still alive?
[62:47.57]Not anymore.
[62:51.49]What if...
[62:53.17]Oh, there's two secret items in every level, probably.
[62:55.13]Really?
[62:55.67]There was something like that in the last game, too, I think.
[62:59.81]Are we all together?
[63:00.39]Uh... I think we are, yeah.
[63:04.21]But I hear the ground... This guy needs health, like, really, really badly.
[63:07.97]Watch out, watch out!
[63:08.57]There's a weird, like, slug.
[63:10.33]There's a weird, like, tank slime.
[63:13.01]I think this is King Rat.
[63:17.25]He needs this.
[63:18.07]Take that.
[63:18.41]Just a hunch.
[63:21.76]This does look like King Rat.
[63:28.11]Oh, God.
[63:29.43]I'm kiting him around.
[63:30.63]Got speed potion.
[63:33.45]Oh, God.
[63:34.49]He really wants me.
[63:39.46]He really wants me.
[63:40.46]I'm out of ammo.
[63:42.66]Okay, one hit breaks all of your shields.
[63:45.28]If you block.
[63:45.76]Right in the skull.
[63:57.02]Dodge, dodge, please.
[64:00.59]He's almost dead.
[64:02.85]Ow!
[64:03.27]Shit, really?
[64:03.81]Alright, he's good.
[64:05.31]Now carve him up and carve up his tank as plate.
[64:09.89]That was a Monster Hunter reference.
[64:10.99]Uh, no, I'm fine.
[64:19.50]I need ammo, though.
[64:21.30]Ammo.
[64:26.93]If I was ammo, where would I be?
[64:27.97]Probably in one of these boxes.
[64:30.57]Maybe right here?
[64:33.98]No.
[64:37.50]That was a $5 reference.
[64:41.44]You mean a $0 reference.
[64:43.90]What was the reference?
[64:44.92]I made a monster.
[64:45.70]I made just an in-passing Monster Hunter reference.
[64:50.87]Guy with a spear.
[64:51.39]Guy with a spear behind me.
[64:52.89]He's going to grab me.
[64:53.53]I know it.
[64:55.60]I knew it.
[64:56.36]I fucking knew it.
[64:57.60]I could feel it.
[64:59.68]I could smell it.
[65:00.38]It didn't matter.
[65:00.80]I turned around and ran away and I couldn't do anything about it.
[65:04.53]I thought that was in the game.
[65:06.63]That was really loud to be in the game, but I thought it was for some reason.
[65:19.08]No ammo?
[65:20.26]Watch out, this guy's, uh, Etalyx, you're just kind of hanging out back there.
[65:23.63]Careful.
[65:24.03]Hey, am I hanging out or are you guys leaving me?
[65:26.29]Which one?
[65:26.91]Um, does it really, is there a difference?
[65:31.67]Get another book?
[65:34.36]There's no time for reading.
[65:37.06]Not right now.
[65:39.02]I desperately need ammo.
[65:40.60]But this is a nice day.
[65:41.96]I need ammo too.
[65:42.62]There's a lot of people here.
[65:43.94]There are, yeah.
[65:57.72]Ammo in one of these boxes?
[65:59.10]Oh, there's a lot of people over here, but I need to open the crate up.
[66:00.98]Nothing.
[66:02.56]Got a lot of reach.
[66:03.38]Why is it empty?
[66:04.64]Empty crate.
[66:05.52]Oh, no.
[66:07.20]Not good.
[66:07.58]I see it.
[66:08.30]Not good.
[66:09.22]Yeah, that's not good, actually.
[66:10.84]And that's a machine gunner.
[66:11.86]Machine gunner.
[66:14.81]Thank you.
[66:17.89]He's like, no, it's a flamethrower.
[66:19.01]He's currently aiming at me.
[66:22.51]I got the flamethrower down.
[66:25.69]Oh, boy.
[66:26.51]Uh-oh, I'm down.
[66:29.91]There's a lot of commotion here.
[66:31.19]Yes, there is.
[66:35.17]And Destroid's almost down.
[66:37.55]Glovel's almost down.
[66:38.53]It might come down to Greg.
[66:40.41]Is it going to come down to Greg?
[66:42.11]Maybe.
[66:42.43]I'm about to be perma-dead if you guys don't come over here.
[66:44.47]I'm coming.
[66:49.20]Oh my god, there's so many people.
[66:52.82]Oh, this is bad.
[66:53.52]Glovel saved the day.
[66:55.60]There's just too many people here.
[66:56.58]Holy shit.
[66:59.59]Holy shit.
[67:05.35]Who's down now?
[67:07.55]Uh, Glovel is.
[67:10.05]Fuck.
[67:12.55]There's too many!
[67:13.77]There's too many, yes.
[67:14.93]I don't know what this potion does, but I'm gonna use it.
[67:19.09]Glovel, I'm sorry.
[67:24.37]Oh my god.
[67:25.57]Still no ammo.
[67:28.82]I would love to help you, but there are... Hang on, I'm helping.
[67:31.74]Nothing?
[67:32.54]Nothing over here?
[67:36.68]He's dead.
[67:38.08]He's perma-dead.
[67:38.86]No.
[67:39.44]Almost got there.
[67:45.26]We can rescue him, though.
[67:47.27]We can rescue him.
[67:48.07]We have to survive long enough to rescue him.
[67:50.53]That's the real trick.
[67:51.43]This has got to be like a random ammo cartridge somewhere over here, right?
[67:54.99]I don't know.
[67:57.31]I can't find anything.
[67:59.71]I killed him?
[68:00.29]No, I didn't.
[68:00.73]What are you talking about?
[68:01.37]It's your fault.
[68:04.61]I was trying.
[68:05.83]He's right here.
[68:06.31]Set free.
[68:08.43]Hey, he's back with us already.
[68:10.78]This was the checkpoint.
[68:13.36]As long as we made it through here.
[68:15.91]Still no ammo.
[68:17.74]Which, that's not cool.
[68:22.26]Well, maybe.
[68:23.06]There's medical supplies.
[68:26.03]Still pretty good.
[68:28.47]There's another med supply in here.
[68:29.95]Hey!
[68:30.87]Med supplies!
[68:31.74]That's not what I wanted though.
[68:37.85]I'm just walking around with a bomb.
[68:38.87]Hey, ammo crate.
[68:39.75]Ammo crate?
[68:40.95]Yeah.
[68:41.43]Nice.
[68:41.69]And toxic cloud.
[68:43.15]Hey, under.
[68:44.97]Under.
[68:45.37]Watch out.
[68:45.71]I'm just going to throw this over there.
[68:47.05]Who cares?
[68:47.39]That's an explosive barrel.
[68:48.67]Just watch out.
[68:50.71]Watch out.
[68:52.21]I'm stuck in the corner.
[68:53.29]I'm in a corner.
[68:55.35]Sorry, you were out of the blast radius.
[68:57.47]I was out of the blast radius.
[68:58.70]I'm just going to sit here.
[68:59.96]That's this guy mounted on top of the torch.
[69:06.30]What are you laughing at?
[69:07.97]You don't see this ragdoll right here?
[69:09.21]I mean, I do.
[69:10.11]He's riding the torch for me.
[69:12.35]Alright, I don't want to go anywhere yet because I don't want to use as many arrows as I can.
[69:17.49]Did we get the guy that needed to be freed?
[69:20.66]I think so.
[69:21.46]No, I didn't.
[69:22.36]He's down here.
[69:22.90]Is he set free?
[69:25.80]We're on the way.
[69:28.26]Whoops, I should have picked that up.
[69:32.28]He's got it on his crotch, yeah.
[69:37.52]Oh, you have to break that?
[69:38.80]There he is.
[69:39.20]I hear a loud noise.
[69:43.62]Big boy.
[69:44.88]Big boy.
[69:47.00]He took a shortcut.
[69:48.06]Dying is a shortcut in this game.
[69:50.58]Well, you can say the same thing about Left 4 Dead.
[69:53.84]You can say the exact same thing.
[69:54.93]He's screaming.
[69:59.87]I don't know, but if we keep moving, then we'll win the game.
[70:03.79]You are correct.
[70:04.43]No, we made it.
[70:08.69]To the winning?
[70:09.95]Oh shit!
[70:14.09]Oh my god!
[70:14.67]I gotta get away from this!
[70:25.49]Nooo!
[70:30.61]Nooo!
[70:31.93]No!
[70:32.19]Oh, no indeed.
[70:34.33]Oh, I'm trying!
[70:35.35]Oh, I'm trying!
[70:37.34]No, I'm trying.
[70:38.80]We're in trouble.
[70:40.12]Oh boy!
[70:40.74]I don't know what just happened.
[70:43.14]Somebody did a super move.
[70:46.90]Oh, fuck you!
[70:47.79]Come on, really?
[70:48.87]I backed up right into that.
[70:49.87]Okay, I think we're okay.
[71:07.54]Oh no, a hunter.
[71:09.12]Is anyone about to die right now?
[71:10.54]Because I have a med kit.
[71:12.50]Our witch hunter is.
[71:14.70]Okay, witch hunter, come to mama.
[71:16.68]I'm pretty sure everybody is, except for me.
[71:19.48]His health bar is white, which means if he dies again, he's dead dead.
[71:24.31]Yeah, he's actually dead.
[71:29.41]There we go.
[71:32.83]He's good as new.
[71:34.45]God damn it.
[71:34.99]The cool thing I wanted to do didn't even work.
[71:41.58]What?
[71:42.10]Where?
[71:42.59]Okay.
[71:44.43]Sure.
[71:44.95]No, here he is.
[71:45.49]Okay.
[71:48.97]Now he's still alive.
[71:52.03]Now he's dead.
[71:54.79]That's what I wanted.
[72:08.24]Use the regular attack to clear hordes.
[72:11.68]Yeah, I'm just panicking.
[72:13.48]I think the default spam left click is good for the baby minion hordes.
[72:19.22]You just hold it for the armor.
[72:23.22]Works pretty well.
[72:28.03]Hello.
[72:28.31]Find the source of the disturbance.
[72:29.51]I wonder if we just keep going in the right direction.
[72:33.07]We'll find it.
[72:36.95]Of course we would.
[72:38.15]Saying the absolute just most redundant sentence.
[72:50.70]He went up here.
[72:51.90]What is up here?
[72:56.44]Nothing.
[72:59.14]Where's this hook rat?
[73:00.36]Help!
[73:01.82]Got it.
[73:03.00]I knew he was coming, but I couldn't shoot him in time.
[73:04.96]Hmm.
[73:06.84]Where do we go?
[73:07.30]I don't know.
[73:08.76]That's not good.
[73:10.46]We probably need to get together here, though, because here comes a lot.
[73:14.79]Here's the fire guy on top.
[73:18.25]Where's he at?
[73:18.61]Oh, no.
[73:18.91]I see him.
[73:22.13]I think he's dead.
[73:23.47]Better run!
[73:25.93]Wow!
[73:32.30]No, what am I doing?
[73:36.76]Click, click, click, click, click.
[73:43.32]I think we're going the right way now though.
[73:45.41]Are we?
[73:45.77]I feel like we're back where we were.
[73:47.15]Are we?
[73:48.51]What was that?
[73:48.89]I think we may have gone in a full circle.
[73:50.81]Did we just go around in a couple of leagues?
[73:52.08]We may have.
[73:52.44]I don't think we did, did we?
[73:55.32]Find the source of the disturbance.
[73:57.00]So it might be like one of those issues where it's in a random spot.
[74:00.24]This looks new.
[74:01.22]What's that up there?
[74:03.44]It is a grimoire.
[74:08.01]Watch out.
[74:08.65]Watch out!
[74:09.21]It is the other book.
[74:11.61]God, I'm right in the skull.
[74:12.81]Except I missed.
[74:15.67]Good aim.
[74:16.89]Really bad aim.
[74:20.27]Blightstormer?
[74:21.15]We have to reach that Blightstormer.
[74:23.43]No, no, no.
[74:24.59]We're just taking too much time and the game's just spawning on us.
[74:29.23]What is that?
[74:32.23]Are you sure that's not the Blight?
[74:33.35]That is the Blightstormer.
[74:34.58]I mean, that is the Blightstormer, but I think he spawned because we're taking too long.
[74:39.50]We don't know where we're going.
[74:43.60]Where is the Blightstormer?
[74:44.78]I think he's dead now.
[74:45.54]There's some ammo here if you need it.
[74:47.78]Hmm, I do.
[74:53.90]Who's yelling behind us?
[74:55.94]There's a guy with a flamethrower.
[74:59.82]Oh, God.
[75:00.20]I'm going to shoot him from behind.
[75:07.58]My heart is racing.
[75:08.86]I got Kruger.
[75:09.74]Don't worry.
[75:13.17]I saved.
[75:13.61]Kruger's Kruger.
[75:18.00]This is going to turn into an actual horror movie where we... The scene where we pass the same tree that we marked four hours ago.
[75:25.59]Where did you come from?
[75:27.07]Did I watch you do this to me?
[75:28.75]I think I actually watched you do that.
[75:30.07]Alright, this is an explosive barrel.
[75:34.78]This looks... If this is an explosive barrel that has not been picked up, it's definitely a place we have not been.
[75:39.82]Okay, well, that's what I have.
[75:42.55]Because why would it be there?
[75:44.43]I pick every single one of those up and throw them.
[75:46.37]You know what I mean?
[75:48.31]Like that?
[75:48.59]I always pick those up and throw them.
[75:50.05]So we're in a place we've never been.
[75:57.30]That was kind of a weak explosive parable.
[76:01.44]No, I cut off his hand that had the shield.
[76:08.58]Somebody okay?
[76:10.28]I'm working on it.
[76:12.00]Oh, now I'm not okay.
[76:13.99]And the cycle continues.
[76:17.41]Like, one guy's not okay.
[76:18.75]You help him.
[76:19.37]Then you're not okay.
[76:21.25]That is the cycle.
[76:21.99]It's that Malcolm in the Middle scene.
[76:24.93]No, I've never even seen one full episode of Malcolm in the Middle.
[76:28.40]Me neither.
[76:28.72]I just saw that scene on YouTube.
[76:30.61]Wait, you've never seen... I thought you were like a TV guy.
[76:34.74]I've just seen that one scene, that funny scene on YouTube.
[76:37.32]I thought you were like Mr. TV.
[76:39.38]You have never seen Malcolm in the Middle.
[76:41.06]I like TV, but there's... It's not like someone who likes TV has seen every TV, you know what I mean?
[76:46.42]What?
[76:46.76]But that's Malcolm in the Middle.
[76:47.78]That's Bryan Cranston's first ever appearance in TV.
[76:50.50]What does Bryan Cranston have to do with it?
[76:52.39]He's in Malcolm in the Middle.
[76:53.99]He's the dad in Malcolm in the Middle.
[76:55.59]I know who he is, but like, is that why it's significant?
[76:58.27]Yes.
[76:59.88]Is Malcolm in the Middle only significant because it's Bryan Cranston's first TV show?
[77:03.90]Yes.
[77:06.70]You might be inflaming a lot of people right now.
[77:09.00]Why would I be inflaming them?
[77:10.91]Does anybody really care?
[77:13.11]Is he the only redeeming quality?
[77:14.55]Does anybody really care about Freddie Prinze Jr.?
[77:17.63]I don't think so.
[77:18.85]What did he do?
[77:19.37]He went on to be like Agent Cody Banks, right?
[77:23.97]What did Bryan Cranston do?
[77:25.81]Breaking Bad.
[77:29.62]I didn't finish that either.
[77:30.38]Uh, this looks, this looks, this looks, uh... Oh, look!
[77:40.72]Completely inflamed.
[77:42.00]We must stop the ritual!
[77:50.67]what is breaking bad what dude oh my god you gotta watch breaking bad just lock yourself in your room for a month and watch every episode it's only an hour per TV show there's five seasons it's like tw it's 16 days straight of TV go do it now or I will never talk to you again did I do it right uh that is what most people sound like when they when I tell them I have not seen breaking bad after season two
[78:19.38]We have this conversation, though, like twice a year.
[78:21.29]Yeah.
[78:22.73]I don't think I can hurt him.
[78:25.99]Well, you thought a little prematurely.
[78:28.58]Alright.
[78:30.02]I'm ready.
[78:33.31]Of course I missed.
[78:34.28]Hey, wait, dude, do you work?
[78:36.50]Yeah, I work.
[78:37.62]I work like a full-time job.
[78:39.70]You do?
[78:40.48]Oh, dude, just quit work.
[78:42.04]Just quit.
[78:42.62]Quit your job and watch Breaking Bad for like 30 days straight and get fired.
[78:46.10]Who cares?
[78:46.58]At least you'll be able to say you watched Breaking Bad.
[78:54.17]This is it.
[78:55.39]This is gonna be it.
[78:57.03]This is, yeah.
[78:59.59]Pretty big area.
[79:02.71]Of magic and mysticism.
[79:07.22]Oh, okay.
[79:07.82]I didn't just... No, there was ammo back there.
[79:09.46]The big crate.
[79:10.20]Did you miss it?
[79:11.68]All the way back when we first came in.
[79:13.32]All the way back.
[79:14.04]Keep going.
[79:14.44]Okay.
[79:15.50]There is an ammo crate.
[79:17.21]Like, right when we came up here.
[79:24.71]It's somewhere over here.
[79:26.19]I swear to God, it's somewhere over here.
[79:27.63]I just picked it up.
[79:29.66]Well, I'm sorry to... I'm sorry.
[79:34.04]Sorry, I don't know where it was.
[79:35.48]It was like right here somewhere.
[79:38.88]Just keep going.
[79:39.46]Oh, we are not helping out our friends.
[79:41.29]No, we're not at all.
[79:42.09]They are very, very not... He was just screaming into the mic.
[79:48.03]I heard like an extremely loud... Fuck!
[79:54.49]Now we activate that one.
[79:56.37]Two more?
[79:58.87]There's ammo on that dude.
[79:59.65]Oh no, I fell off.
[80:00.41]So wait, do we have to do- is this like a puzzle?
[80:02.35]It's a puzzle, we have to rotate- Yeah, it's a puzzle.
[80:04.63]The, uh, the alignments.
[80:06.87]Just so.
[80:07.39]So how- Align them- oh, I see what we have to do.
[80:15.76]This is- this sucks.
[80:17.76]Alright, I'll get the other one.
[80:18.46]This sucks.
[80:22.25]While being harassed by these rats.
[80:27.19]Get outta here.
[80:35.35]We have to go to one of the other ones, though.
[80:36.73]There's two more.
[80:37.41]Yeah, we have to go to the other ones and do all the layers.
[80:40.33]Alright, so... Let's just stay together and do it.
[80:43.33]Unless we want to do it really quickly, and I could probably do it real quick if I go to the other one right now.
[80:48.95]But I'm not gonna do that.
[80:53.23]Up top.
[80:53.65]Watch it.
[80:55.60]I gotta rotate this all the way back around.
[80:57.26]Ooh, getting some frame lag there.
[81:01.78]Whoopsie-daisy, whoopsie-doo.
[81:05.62]Wait for it.
[81:09.10]How are your triangles going?
[81:11.00]Got it.
[81:11.26]One more.
[81:19.32]Back it up.
[81:21.12]Ooh, watch it.
[81:22.44]Don't get yourself killed.
[81:26.38]And a little bit further.
[81:29.02]Wait, what?
[81:30.36]Did we do this right?
[81:31.89]Yeah, you gotta line up the two channels with the other blue channels.
[81:36.20]Alright, so... One, two, three... Stop!
[81:41.91]There it is.
[81:44.51]Survive until the alignment.
[81:47.11]What the fu- I just fell off.
[81:49.41]We're aligning the stars.
[81:54.65]What the hell just happened?
[81:57.71]Holy shit.
[82:00.72]Ah, no.
[82:01.42]I don't think so.
[82:12.30]Is that it?
[82:15.14]Escape through the boss.
[82:21.07]Alright, did we just beat our first ever mission?
[82:23.56]We just beat our first mission.
[82:24.78]Who knew it would only require four players of people of human quality inside of a multiplayer game?
[82:33.12]That guy was freaking out.
[82:36.08]Alright, so now, used to you, you'd get certain rewards for completing things, right?
[82:41.83]We should get some loot.
[82:42.69]We should get some experience.
[82:48.91]Complete mission.
[82:50.17]Hero's alive.
[82:52.27]Got a couple of Grimoires.
[82:56.65]Sword and dagger, weapon unlocked.
[83:00.61]Commendium.
[83:02.06]Commendation chest.
[83:03.40]Commendations?
[83:04.68]Commendium.
[83:06.46]We got Commendian.
[83:07.62]This is just on recruit difficulty.
[83:11.46]Alright, cool.
[83:16.18]So for everything that you collect, you get a bar that increases and it makes your box better.
[83:23.91]Okay, that's addicting.
[83:27.77]No paying for shit, by the way.
[83:30.87]Just so we're clear.
[83:32.44]I was the worst.
[83:34.12]You were the worst.
[83:34.66]But I had the most storm vermin kills.
[83:38.10]um and I was the team player look at look I'm the medic dwarf okay yeah that's fine you can be the ranged guy so how do you open the box aids guy oh cool we got carried pretty hard well this is the first time we played the game
[84:01.70]I know.
[84:02.04]I know.
[84:02.74]I'm just glad that we accepted help, you know?
[84:06.36]That's all I'm saying.
[84:07.30]Where do you open the chests?
[84:10.56]Right here in the middle.
[84:12.54]Melee.
[84:13.52]Okay.
[84:13.84]Spoils of war.
[84:15.10]Got new shit, don't we?
[84:18.57]How does this work?
[84:19.17]Alright, so first you come over here.
[84:22.47]Then you put in your PayPal.
[84:23.73]You buy the loot crates.
[84:27.89]Open.
[84:29.17]Plentiful elven repeating crossbow.
[84:33.33]I got a box within a box.
[84:36.21]I got... I got two boxes within boxes.
[84:41.19]Oh, they're trinkets.
[84:44.93]One of them sucks.
[84:47.81]Sword and dagger.
[84:48.95]Ooh.
[84:51.89]Nice.
[84:52.17]Chests have six different tiers.
[84:53.76]Alright, now how do these work?
[84:57.36]I believe these are only in-game.
[84:59.66]I don't think there's actually microtransactions.
[85:01.36]That was a joke.
[85:03.24]Any character can put on any weapon?
[85:05.92]I'm still learning, but I've gotten a lot of necklaces.
[85:10.54]Like, literally five of six of my items were necklaces.
[85:15.68]So this is power 23.
[85:16.63]I'm definitely going to use this thing.
[85:20.05]It's way better.
[85:20.93]Can you just sell shit?
[85:23.39]Listen, you played the first game.
[85:26.49]Shouldn't you be answering my question?
[85:27.77]This is nothing like the first game.
[85:30.89]Really?
[85:31.67]Like, none of this is even... None of this was even in the first game.
[85:35.14]There was items in the game, but it was weapons.
[85:39.12]You only get loot based on the character you're currently playing when opening the loot box now.
[85:42.96]Oh, okay.
[85:44.52]That's pretty neat, actually, so you can just kind of grind the character that you want
[85:50.01]Oh boy, another loot box system.
[85:51.37]Here's the thing, though.
[85:52.75]There's no in-game purchases.
[85:55.07]As far as I... No, no, there isn't.
[85:57.96]There's not any.
[85:58.98]There is not any in-game purchases.
[86:01.64]This is just a loot-based game.
[86:02.98]It's a loot-based game where you open shit up.
[86:05.62]So instead of like, oh, it's on the ground, you just get it from a box.
[86:08.66]It's essentially the same thing.
[86:10.00]Okay.
[86:13.80]Okay.
[86:15.58]Oh, so necklaces are not trinkets.
[86:17.70]You probably can't buy them because it's the beta.
[86:19.33]No, they have clearly stated that they're only going to do paid items as cosmetics, like skins.
[86:26.35]Additionally, nothing that, like, the real beta, quote-unquote, is the 28th.
[86:33.60]Yes, this is the fake beta.
[86:34.96]Closed beta, yeah.
[86:36.74]So here's my new weapon.
[86:38.56]That's cool.
[86:39.74]Oh, alright, so it's a little different.
[86:41.80]Nice, alright.
[86:42.60]I like it.
[86:46.56]So it's pay to win.
[86:47.78]I, I, no.
[86:49.50]Yeah, you pay to win.
[86:50.44]You buy the game and then you win.
[86:52.04]Are we going to do another mission?
[86:53.84]Let's do another one.
[86:54.58]No, stream's over.
[86:55.64]That's it.
[86:56.32]Alright, see ya.
[86:57.98]It's a good game.
[86:59.16]I enjoyed it.
[87:00.18]Let's, um, you want to do it?
[87:02.19]What do you want to do?
[87:02.85]You want to queue us up for another one?
[87:04.29]I'm just looking at, uh... Should we redo it and should we bring two new people in?
[87:07.65]We should do the first mission again.
[87:08.95]Are we going to stay with these two or are we going to bring in... Oh, that's a good question.
[87:11.85]This guy has a lawnmower.
[87:13.29]What the hell does this guy have for a weapon?
[87:15.88]This guy has one of those training dummies as a weapon.
[87:19.92]What?
[87:22.24]Okay.
[87:22.98]Is that real?
[87:25.18]Come into the light where we can actually, he's just one big shadow right now for me.
[87:31.75]Oh, you can pick it up.
[87:32.35]Oh, you can pick it up.
[87:33.07]Okay, I get it.
[87:34.21]I thought that was the actual item.
[87:36.69]The game would have gotten five times better if you could actually pick it up.
[87:39.07]You can actually just test your items.
[87:40.45]Oh, you can see your DPS.
[87:43.67]Can somebody run the meters, please?
[87:45.87]Alright, no more fun.
[87:46.59]Fun's fucking over.
[87:47.54]Alright, let's do another mission.
[87:52.10]Yeah, I got like a brand new gun type.
[87:54.68]Let's do one more with these guys and then we'll bring more people in.
[87:57.32]We'll do another game.
[87:57.82]So did you just unlock a new bow?
[88:00.34]Um, I don't think so.
[88:02.76]Well, in case you were curious, I was using a crossbow the entire last round and I just unlocked a shotgun.
[88:09.77]I have a new weapon.
[88:10.77]I have a new melee weapon.
[88:12.89]Oh, really?
[88:13.45]Yeah.
[88:14.21]Oh, you've got dual blades now.
[88:15.19]I do.
[88:15.41]That's cool.
[88:16.69]They're much better than they were before.
[88:20.20]Alright, let's do another one.
[88:23.10]So let's do... Are we doing story mode?
[88:26.86]Should we just do the first mission just to beat it?
[88:30.43]And we're gonna do... We should do the first mission.
[88:32.25]Oh, we can't even do veteran.
[88:33.67]Are you sure we... Maybe we should swap it up and let different people play each mission.
[88:37.50]You wanna swap it up?
[88:38.98]Alright, yeah, that's fine.
[88:39.50]Let's do that.
[88:40.02]So how do we... How do we kick these people?
[88:42.08]That's a mean way to disband party, right?
[88:43.94]It is a mean way.
[88:45.18]No offense to the people we're playing with.
[88:46.40]You guys carried the team.
[88:47.32]You guys were great.
[88:48.56]If you're watching the stream, thanks, guys.
[88:50.26]But we just wanna give other people a fair opportunity to, you know, play with what amounts to royalty, really.
[88:57.09]Oh, please.
[88:58.92]The Jerma nine eight five in the game in the same game.
[89:02.56]You're gonna tell your grandchildren about that.
[89:04.23]Alright, join up me Just kidding.
[89:07.43]You won't have any grandchildren Mod them you'll have great grandchildren.
[89:13.61]You got a repeating crossbow.
[89:14.75]Can I use that as the on this character?
[89:16.18]I guess I can huh?
[89:18.62]Where is it?
[89:21.86]I Don't think I can use it on this character
[89:27.73]shade yeah I can't use it on her I guess alright you joining off me I am let's do the first mission and let's actually beat the first mission this time gosh darn it here's the wardrobe room
[89:54.96]put on different clothes no talent when do you get level five what do we know level two we're level two right you gotta be you gotta be hero level 120 power wise hero power 120 to do with the other missions well my hero power just went up significantly right because it was I mean all of our weapons were at five what do you got now I'm at 35. I'm at 42 power level apparently I got better loot man that's not fair
[90:21.87]What is this?
[90:23.03]Oh, is this hero selection?
[90:25.10]Anyway.
[90:27.02]Do you want me to do the thing again?
[90:28.40]Do the thing.
[90:29.86]Let's do the first mission.
[90:30.64]Alright.
[90:33.88]We're going to start.
[90:34.36]We're going to do mission number one.
[90:35.40]Okay.
[90:36.54]I'm going to give you guys a fair warning so you don't have to refresh.
[90:39.67]Alright.
[90:40.99]I am clicking.
[90:41.67]You're going to hear it delayed, though, like 30 seconds delayed.
[90:44.59]Yes, they are going to get it delayed.
[90:46.19]But I'm about to push the button in three, two, one.
[90:50.30]It's live.
[90:52.15]Selected.
[90:57.01]When is this beta over?
[90:59.29]And why are they doing this beta and then another beta in four days?
[91:02.94]Well, I mean, there's clearly still text missing and stuff from the game.
[91:06.86]So I'm pretty sure this is still not the final build necessarily.
[91:14.36]I feel like this is an actual beta and they're just really cutting it close to the release of the game.
[91:20.34]But so what's the beta on the 28th for?
[91:22.86]The beta on the 28th was the originally planned one that they had publicized.
[91:27.06]I feel like they just opened this one up because when I pre-ordered the game like a week ago, it just unlocked this closed beta.
[91:35.16]And so I think they kind of did that on accident.
[91:38.12]We got two friends here.
[91:39.54]When they opened pre-orders.
[91:42.48]This one ends the 26th.
[91:43.44]28th, the pre-order head start beta starts.
[91:47.20]I guess.
[91:47.52]This one is like testing servers, testing maps.
[91:50.66]The next one on the 28th, you save your progress.
[91:53.71]Right.
[91:54.95]All the loot that we're finding here is going to be erased.
[91:59.47]You pre-ordered this game, right?
[92:00.95]Yeah.
[92:01.39]I pre-ordered this game.
[92:02.51]Why are we allowed to play in this one?
[92:04.77]That's what I'm saying.
[92:05.88]I feel like when they open pre-orders, they may have accidentally let everyone download the beta client.
[92:11.72]Joke's on them.
[92:12.98]They just made it like, hey, if you pre-order the game, you can do the beta now.
[92:18.15]Yes, if you pre-order the game, you can install the closed beta.
[92:21.55]But don't go crazy and no-life try-hard it because every character is getting wiped in three days, right?
[92:28.28]Uh, yes, by the, bait on the 28th, that's when you should start tryharding.
[92:32.56]Yeah.
[92:32.72]If you intend to play this game seriously.
[92:34.32]If you just want to dick around and check out the characters, do that if you want to play it, but do not like, oh no, it's great, I'm gonna like, I'm gonna call out sick from work for three days, and grind this game for 12 hours a day.
[92:44.97]Plus, you would be no-lifing three missions.
[92:47.77]Yeah, plus, you have to reserve that time for Breaking Bad, so if you're gonna quit your job, you know, that's important that you have enough time to do, you gotta pick one or the other.
[92:58.11]No, definitely.
[92:59.79]I would say that's probably a better idea to watch Breaking Bad instead.
[93:04.01]I would disagree, but that's just me.
[93:08.81]Yeah, so when you quit your job, you only get like four more days to live, apparently.
[93:15.07]After you quit, I said apparently you only get four more days to live.
[93:18.27]Like, oh, you quit your job, you get four days.
[93:22.23]If you choose wrong, you never get a do-over.
[93:25.19]Alright, Talek, if you had four days left to live, what would you do?
[93:31.70]Well, what's the reason?
[93:33.68]That's it.
[93:34.02]Like, the world, like, God... Am I just gonna... Is the world just gonna go black?
[93:38.78]Yeah, like, dark?
[93:39.24]Like, I can't see anything, and then I'm dead.
[93:41.83]Yeah, God spreads the clouds.
[93:43.99]No, God spreads the clouds up, and he's like, Hey, everybody!
[93:46.43]And he's, like, fucking 9,000 feet tall in the clouds.
[93:48.73]And everyone's like, What the fuck?
[93:50.51]Everybody looks up.
[93:52.10]Hey, by the way, the world is over in four days.
[93:55.31]Just want to give everybody a quick heads up.
[93:57.45]Well, that's the thing, right?
[93:58.51]If he tells everyone, then it's just the purge.
[94:01.67]Like, I don't really get to choose what I want to do because everyone else is doing whatever they want to do.
[94:05.37]Okay.
[94:07.12]It would just be the purge.
[94:10.62]So it would have to be just me for me to be able to answer that question, right?
[94:13.82]Because otherwise, if everyone knows, then the jig is up.
[94:18.00]Fun's over.
[94:18.35]That's true.
[94:22.53]So, alright, if only you knew, what would you do?
[94:24.71]I'm gonna die, by the way.
[94:25.79]Holy shit.
[94:26.43]I was about to die, too.
[94:27.25]I just have, like, three Centurions.
[94:28.99]Uh... I don't know.
[94:31.08]I'd probably, like... Definitely do something... I would probably be the boring guy who, like, looks up someone else's bucket list to find interesting things to do.
[94:44.45]Hold on.
[94:45.78]If God wisps... If God... Some guy grabs you on the street and you look over and there's a guy with a big top hat on and his face is like... You know it's... It's not just a random guy.
[94:55.28]He's got like a... Like swirling white clouds around his face.
[94:58.71]It's clearly something's going on with this guy that's magical.
[95:01.65]Like it's not just a joke.
[95:03.39]There's no fog machine.
[95:04.35]It's not a joke.
[95:04.75]No, clearly not a joke.
[95:05.77]But that's why I would look up someone else's list, because why would I want to waste what precious time I have left trying to create my own bucket list when I could just steal someone else's instantly?
[95:15.43]That saves me so much time.
[95:18.66]Yeah, alright, so, as I admit, you get a bucket list.
[95:22.06]Okay, so what, are you gonna go travel?
[95:25.14]Excuse me, it takes about like three days, it takes like two days for you to travel.
[95:28.18]Oh, I wanna go to Japan, I've never been to Japan before.
[95:31.28]That's a waste of time.
[95:33.10]That does take all the time.
[95:34.70]I would probably do the most life-threatening extreme sport activities possible, because if they go wrong and I die, then it doesn't matter.
[95:42.20]It just like happened earlier than it was going to already.
[95:44.47]What is so life-threatening dangerous sport that you're describing?
[95:47.27]What about like wingsuit?
[95:48.19]You know, like... Just get in a wingsuit and just do it into a tree.
[95:53.67]Just jump off.
[95:54.09]Just get in a wingsuit and burst into a tree.
[95:56.57]That actually would be not a bad idea.
[95:58.25]Like on the final day, get in like a steep wingsuit.
[96:02.86]And go to the tallest mountain in the world.
[96:04.60]Pay for a helicopter.
[96:05.60]Take like a $40,000 loan out.
[96:07.82]Get a helicopter ride to the top of Everest.
[96:09.92]And then wingsuit down and just whatever happens, happens.
[96:15.91]That would probably be, like, definitely last day activity.
[96:22.59]Or, like, base jumping off the Empire State Building.
[96:25.69]No!
[96:26.07]No, you don't want to do that.
[96:28.62]Why?
[96:29.14]Because that, like, fucks up other people's days.
[96:32.38]That's true.
[96:33.52]You need to go to Everest.
[96:34.52]Who cares about their day if that's my last one?
[96:36.74]Yeah, but you don't want to, like, cause somebody else a problem.
[96:41.57]You don't want to be the guy that Spider-Man'd off of the Empire State Building and all of a sudden it's like, oh, wow, that guy was fucking crazy.
[96:48.67]No, you just do it in Everest.
[96:50.08]I think we're all going to die, by the way.
[96:53.20]We're all gonna die, by the way, in real life.
[96:56.90]So this is like a serious topic.
[96:58.93]No, no, no.
[97:00.49]We're getting deep here, guys.
[97:01.61]I'm saying, no, I'm saying in the game, like, we're all dead.
[97:03.87]What would you do if you were gonna die, like, in three days?
[97:06.43]By the way, guys, we're all gonna die.
[97:10.16]I am actually gonna die in this game, like, in five seconds.
[97:14.16]That's basically the intro to Kick-Ass.
[97:16.32]What?
[97:16.84]Is it?
[97:18.86]What happens in Kick-Ass?
[97:24.02]He's up there.
[97:26.48]Didn't he?
[97:27.50]Yeah, he becomes a superhero, right?
[97:29.57]And he puts on the mask and stuff because he's about to die.
[97:31.55]No, he's not even a real superhero.
[97:33.89]What?
[97:35.15]How does Kick-Ass start?
[97:36.85]I thought Kick-Ass was just somebody who puts a cape on and a mask and he's like, I'm a superhero now because I want to be.
[97:44.19]That's not how Kick-Ass starts?
[97:46.12]Let's find out.
[97:48.04]Just look at the intro to Kick-Ass.
[97:51.56]Alright.
[97:52.91]Some guy just jumps off the Empire State Building because he thinks he was a hero.
[97:56.72]The movie is seven minutes long.
[98:00.59]During his first outing, he gets stabbed and then hit by a car.
[98:03.83]After recovering, he gains the capacity to endure pain and enhance durability because some of his bones were replaced with metal.
[98:11.23]What?
[98:12.83]Hold on.
[98:13.13]In his absence from school, a rumor spreads that he is gay as he was found naked by paramedics after discarding his costume.
[98:21.73]This is the intro to Kick-Ass?
[98:23.45]That's verbatim from Wikipedia.
[98:27.11]What?
[98:31.93]Have I ever seen this movie?
[98:35.59]Maybe.
[98:37.42]I don't think I have.
[98:38.42]I'm trying.
[98:42.50]So that is like the Wikipedia, this is how kick-ass, the plot list.
[98:45.62]I just read that verbatim from Wikipedia.
[98:47.80]He puts on the costume, goes out, gets in a crazy wreck, car hits him, and that's how he gains his extra powers.
[98:55.43]Really?
[98:55.95]Okay.
[98:57.31]I don't see anything about him being terminally ill.
[99:05.40]You know what?
[99:06.68]Here's the thing.
[99:07.24]I found out the problem.
[99:08.44]I've never seen Kick-Ass.
[99:09.52]I've only seen the Jim Carrey scenes in Kick-Ass 2.
[99:12.58]So, yeah.
[99:13.72]I'm speaking from total ignorance.
[99:17.96]I haven't even seen that movie.
[99:20.72]I need health.
[99:23.80]Me too.
[99:25.30]I've already used some.
[99:26.04]Bladehawk is almost dead.
[99:31.86]I've never seen it.
[99:35.58]I feel like that's one of those movies that really doesn't stand up to test time.
[99:40.34]Does it?
[99:40.74]Probably not.
[99:41.16]It was pretty entertaining when it first came out, but... It was just like, hey, superheroes?
[99:49.22]How about a raunchy superhero thing rated R?
[99:52.55]And then they made Deadpool.
[99:55.23]Yeah, and I mean, Deadpool, whoo!
[99:57.91]What a stinker, you know what I mean?
[100:00.19]I mean, that was back before moviegoers were as smart as they are today.
[100:04.45]and had his high IQs, so... Dumber times, dumber movies.
[100:10.18]How do I give this to him?
[100:11.28]That potion.
[100:12.46]Hang on, I gotta give it to this guy.
[100:14.02]Give it to that guy?
[100:14.60]I'm the friend, I'm the streamer!
[100:16.28]I gave it to him, but I don't know if he knows it.
[100:19.36]You take care of the streamer.
[100:22.10]We're the ones streaming.
[100:23.38]We need to make sure we're at full health, because we're the camera!
[100:25.24]Oh fuck, rat ogre.
[100:35.20]I got a bomb.
[100:36.44]Watch out.
[100:37.02]Corner.
[100:37.28]Oh, I do too.
[100:38.18]Bomb him up.
[100:39.28]I do too.
[100:40.66]That was a double bomb.
[100:41.67]He's got double.
[100:42.19]Look at this.
[100:42.81]Look at the double tick damage there.
[100:43.97]That's two dots at the same time.
[100:46.57]I can't wait to see that special infected damage.
[100:49.09]That really instantly killed him.
[100:52.51]Actually.
[100:52.93]I grabbed.
[100:56.72]Hello?
[100:59.28]I thought my stream just turned off.
[101:00.68]Working on it.
[101:01.46]Working on it.
[101:09.28]Well, I don't know what happened there.
[101:18.45]Well, it's definitely as fun as the first one in regards to swinging and stuff.
[101:23.10]I feel like they made the swinging better.
[101:24.94]But does it hold up after four, five, six missions?
[101:27.96]I wonder.
[101:28.40]Is the loot system deep enough?
[101:30.60]Is there enough content to justify playing through?
[101:33.86]How many missions are there?
[101:35.04]The thing is, like, with Vermintide 2, it's $24 as well.
[101:39.01]Okay, price point sounds pretty good.
[101:42.07]Price point does sound pretty good.
[101:43.29]The price point's there.
[101:45.19]And Scratch is a niche that I don't think is really filled today by other games.
[101:48.99]Is there another four-player... Killing for two!
[101:51.78]That was so loud, I'm sorry.
[101:54.86]What did you say?
[101:55.78]Hey, you'll have to figure it out.
[101:58.66]You'll figure it out, okay.
[102:03.06]I just, like, screamed.
[102:05.82]I'm so sorry, everybody.
[102:06.90]That probably sucked.
[102:07.82]90 DB.
[102:10.64]I'm not wrong, though.
[102:19.80]Thanks, I'm deaf.
[102:20.64]I'm sorry.
[102:22.58]I forgot.
[102:23.06]I changed where my microphone is.
[102:24.96]I moved it.
[102:25.52]It's in a different spot.
[102:27.11]And usually when I do the lean forward and yell thing, my microphone's underneath where I'm yelling, and I yelled right into it.
[102:35.93]I just need to wholeheartedly apologize for that one.
[102:43.08]You got payday to the heist, you got killing floor, you've got... What's another one?
[102:51.24]Well, I didn't mean to do that.
[102:52.28]What are we looking for?
[102:57.08]Move along the wall.
[102:57.62]We gotta go up.
[102:59.30]He's down here.
[103:00.54]Well, that's... I'm down.
[103:03.17]Are you?
[103:04.37]Did you fall?
[103:06.29]No, it was a gas explosion.
[103:08.55]I was trying to bandage someone.
[103:11.73]Now I need to bandage myself.
[103:14.77]You need to do EQ with it, so make a cap to prevent it from getting that loud.
[103:21.49]You know, actually, the thing I have is supposed to do that, but it just doesn't do that.
[103:29.08]Or maybe I read the instructions wrong.
[103:41.01]He's dead.
[103:47.09]It wasn't that loud, though.
[103:48.77]Didn't actually get that loud.
[103:50.82]Well, maybe my thing's working.
[103:52.14]Maybe it's not as good as some of those more expensive, cool ones.
[103:57.44]You going to have to turn it on?
[103:59.50]What engine is this on?
[104:00.42]That's a really good question, actually.
[104:02.60]I don't know.
[104:04.88]Might be in-house.
[104:06.48]Probably not, though, because they're pretty... I think Fat Shark is not a huge team.
[104:10.38]I can't imagine this is an in-house engine.
[104:15.10]Well, I don't want to be over here.
[104:16.20]I want to be over here.
[104:21.06]How we doing?
[104:22.12]We just got to move.
[104:24.66]We got to move it on out.
[104:28.26]Could be Unreal.
[104:29.14]It's probably Unreal.
[104:30.48]What is the engine, you think?
[104:33.32]Uh...
[104:34.59]Probably Unreal.
[104:36.79]It looks like it could be Unreal.
[104:39.93]Who knows?
[104:40.21]Maybe they'll surprise us.
[104:41.01]Maybe they'll announce it's in Unity.
[104:43.45]They're both dead down here.
[104:45.35]Oh, are they?
[104:45.91]Yeah.
[104:52.86]Is he full dead?
[104:54.80]No.
[104:55.22]Not yet.
[104:55.84]Close, though.
[104:58.44]I thought I just became him.
[105:01.20]Alright.
[105:03.56]Back up.
[105:08.34]It's a Flash game.
[105:12.34]What do you think it would take?
[105:13.32]They make this in Java.
[105:13.92]What do you think it would take to make this in Flash?
[105:17.30]Is it even physically possible to do that in Flash?
[105:20.16]Probably not.
[105:21.52]No.
[105:22.54]Give me a blade.
[105:23.10]Where's Bladehawk?
[105:24.64]Where is he?
[105:24.96]I want to give him this potion.
[105:27.50]Excuse me, I have something for you.
[105:32.71]I'm chasing him around.
[105:34.59]Come here.
[105:35.87]Can I not give this to him?
[105:38.46]Alright.
[105:38.98]Well, I tried.
[105:39.52]This new shotgun thing's pretty good.
[105:50.48]Whoops.
[105:50.86]Rattling gun.
[105:51.34]Where's he at?
[105:52.02]Right there.
[105:53.20]Oh, that didn't hit him.
[105:54.34]There we go.
[105:56.02]Uh-oh.
[106:01.01]Scary, man.
[106:04.41]It's their own engine, apparently.
[106:05.67]That's cool.
[106:08.18]It's pretty good.
[106:08.94]It runs pretty well.
[106:09.96]I mean, there's some... Yeah, it's probably just modified.
[106:12.03]Okay.
[106:12.47]There are some issues I've seen here.
[106:14.27]There's a little bit of slowdown.
[106:16.15]Not anything that's... I don't have any frame slowdown.
[106:20.63]I just have, like, computer slowdown.
[106:23.88]It's weird.
[106:24.48]Even when I'm playing at... I can play at 130 frames per second, but it still locks out my CPU.
[106:30.36]Hmm.
[106:31.76]So I don't see the slowdown, it's just there.
[106:34.52]Well, also streaming the game too.
[106:37.40]If we weren't streaming it, I'm sure the FPS would go up by like 30 to 40%.
[106:42.67]So are you having slowdown?
[106:46.13]No.
[106:46.53]I mean, I'm at like 70 to like 60 to 90 FPS.
[106:48.29]Shh.
[106:50.80]Don't tell them that your slowdown is 60 to 90 FPS or else they're all going to hate you because you're unrelatable.
[106:56.95]They can see it on the screen.
[106:58.45]I can't lie to them.
[107:01.25]Not that they can see it, just that you're saying it's slow.
[107:05.49]Just streamers playing at max settings, 60 to 90 is slow?
[107:09.61]I'm not playing at max settings, by the way.
[107:11.45]I am not doing that.
[107:14.41]I tried turning my max settings to medium.
[107:16.46]I didn't notice any FPS increase.
[107:19.71]You know, actually, here's an interesting analogy here.
[107:22.91]I like my game settings like I like my red meat.
[107:27.69]Medium.
[107:29.07]Medium well.
[107:30.64]Right?
[107:31.00]So if you go to the steakhouse, can you order high or ultra?
[107:34.34]No, no, no, no, no, because that's way overcooked.
[107:39.86]Well done is like fantastic, right?
[107:43.24]Where is this guy?
[107:47.01]as far back as possible what is hitting me what get the fuck away from what are you doing to me can you follow you can fall I was like alright I just screamed again god damn it I was testing to see if you could fall and you can fall and I it dumps
[108:15.02]I was, he was just testing it.
[108:16.50]I knew it.
[108:17.08]No, no, no, no, no.
[108:17.70]It was on purpose.
[108:18.36]Like, it was on purpose, but I didn't think you could fall.
[108:21.49]Like, oh, can you fall?
[108:22.27]You can fall.
[108:22.79]I didn't think you could actually fall, but you can't fall.
[108:24.73]So halfway through me screaming, I realized it wasn't even a big deal.
[108:30.05]There's like another path over here.
[108:31.77]This might be the secret one that you guys are going in, though.
[108:34.30]There's a tomb.
[108:35.38]I think, yeah, as you said, we have three tombs.
[108:38.62]Oh yeah, I remember now from the last game.
[108:44.00]We all have to carry it.
[108:45.18]Somebody has to carry a tomb and replace it with a health kit.
[108:48.21]Who dropped it?
[108:48.75]Did I drop it?
[108:49.81]No, we got three.
[108:50.71]I got one.
[108:51.65]And they have one too.
[108:52.65]We got all three.
[108:56.91]It's the little Half-Life.
[108:58.11]It's the little sushi roll.
[108:59.53]The gnome?
[109:00.61]Yeah, it's the sushi roll gnome.
[109:04.37]But anyways, I like my... I like it medium well.
[109:09.91]He doesn't like too many... Don't talk to him about particle effects, okay?
[109:13.17]Whatever you do.
[109:13.97]Yeah, too much particle effects, too much stuff on the screen, flashes.
[109:17.46]You know what I'm saying?
[109:20.56]I can't hurt this guy.
[109:23.18]Somebody put it down.
[109:24.08]Watch out, he's jumping over the ledge.
[109:28.46]Did somebody put the book down?
[109:30.74]No, we're good.
[109:31.30]I didn't.
[109:31.64]I don't think.
[109:33.18]Looks like we're putting the book down.
[109:34.94]Maybe he's putting it down just to heal and then picking it back up.
[109:37.28]Yeah, probably.
[109:39.64]Well, here's the temple.
[109:43.85]But then there's the people that are like you.
[109:44.91]Oh, we may as well use the medical supplies is probably what's happening.
[109:47.45]I have full health.
[109:49.85]Can I speak candidly with you guys and you?
[109:53.71]You guys and you?
[109:54.72]You guys and you.
[109:55.50]I like talking about you.
[109:56.24]Okay.
[109:57.48]I mean, do you think people actually like to eat rare meat?
[110:02.94]Or is it just like people do it and pretend like they like it so they can sound like cool?
[110:07.20]Like, oh yeah, sir, how would you like that cooked?
[110:10.02]Rare.
[110:11.14]Whoa, I don't think people actually like the way that tastes.
[110:13.60]Like a rare steak or like, I'm talking like blue.
[110:16.56]Like actually rare.
[110:17.90]Like raw.
[110:19.22]But like, don't people say that about sushi?
[110:23.02]No, no, no, but sushi's a little different because there's...
[110:26.52]I genuinely like, no, no, not rare.
[110:27.96]I'm talking about like raw.
[110:29.04]There are people that order their steaks blue.
[110:32.26]Like barely, not even cooked.
[110:33.44]Like, yeah, I'm like, I'm kind of like vamp.
[110:35.11]You know what I mean?
[110:36.41]Is that real?
[110:39.77]I mean, it has to be.
[110:42.88]Some people have to like I mean people like caviar.
[110:45.32]It's fucking raw Yeah, but sushi is I don't know maybe I'm just being totally ignorant when I say this but like sushi tastes good Look, here's what he's trying to say.
[110:55.72]He likes sushi and so it doesn't count.
[110:57.74]That's right.
[110:58.20]I like sushi So it doesn't I like sushi so it doesn't count.
[111:02.85]If you like red meat, like real raw red meat, you gotta go to the doctor.
[111:09.25]If you like raw, you're wrong.
[111:11.43]No, not wrong.
[111:12.55]There's something going on with you.
[111:14.07]You need to go to the doctor.
[111:16.29]And you're gonna go to the doctor, you're gonna be like, doctor, I don't know, I like eating raw meat.
[111:20.30]The doctor's gonna be like, gonna close the door behind you and lock it and be like, do you really?
[111:24.74]Tell me the truth.
[111:25.26]And he's gonna be preparing a fucking green, green liquid syringe.
[111:30.85]Yeah, I actually kind of do like it, and you're gonna like, DING!
[111:32.77]He's gonna stick you, and then you're gonna end up somewhere.
[111:35.07]And they're gonna do like a bunch of tests to you to find out what's wrong with you.
[111:38.47]If you confess to eating raw meat, they're going to do tests.
[111:41.25]If you confess to eating raw meat to your doctor, he's gonna, he's gonna, you're gonna, they're gonna be doing tests to you.
[111:45.69]Like, Albert Wesker style.
[111:49.49]As long as I get to punch a rock afterwards, that's fine.
[111:54.14]And make it move.
[111:57.74]Maybe I should start eating raw meat then.
[112:01.85]Right up there with raw milk.
[112:03.45]Nobody drinks raw milk.
[112:05.67]Who drinks milk anyways?
[112:07.57]A lot of people drink milk.
[112:10.43]Nobody drinks milk.
[112:11.51]I do.
[112:13.09]Wait, you do?
[112:15.61]You know, I've actually been on a real big almond milk kick.
[112:19.49]And not because I think it's healthy.
[112:20.41]That's not regular milk.
[112:21.23]Almond milk is not real milk.
[112:22.89]No, it's not.
[112:25.41]Almond milk is pretend milk.
[112:27.49]I don't even know how they get it, by the way.
[112:30.26]I think there's like two tiny little nipples on the almonds, right?
[112:33.00]And they have to like squeeze them out.
[112:34.70]So what makes almond milk almond milk and not almond juice?
[112:39.43]Alright, I need to pay attention.
[112:42.89]Yeah, it's fucked up.
[112:43.73]You guys think, oh, so humane.
[112:45.27]I'm gonna drink almond milk.
[112:47.06]Oh, yeah?
[112:48.22]You think you're being so cautious and so... They cut off the almonds' arms and legs.
[112:53.88]And the head.
[112:55.42]An Alma doesn't look like that.
[112:56.53]You know the typical Alma that you're seeing in the picture of... Oh, it's just like that.
[112:59.87]The shell, it's crunchy.
[113:01.43]Nope.
[113:02.01]It's got legs, arms, heart.
[113:05.05]They take it all out.
[113:07.97]So humane.
[113:14.09]Nut milk.
[113:16.38]Okay, I'm sorry I just said that out loud.
[113:19.68]Why am I parroting chat?
[113:20.82]That's a bad idea.
[113:22.16]Wait, what did you say?
[113:22.84]Nothin'.
[113:24.61]Nothing?
[113:25.31]Are you antagonizing people?
[113:27.33]A little.
[113:31.12]Are you suggesting that milk is actually just liquid made for baby cattle?
[113:37.22]So if you drink and consume milk, you are effectively a cow?
[113:40.50]No.
[113:40.66]Is that what you're saying?
[113:41.56]No, not at all.
[113:42.74]What were you listening to?
[113:43.53]Oh.
[113:43.61]I could have sworn that's what you said.
[113:46.97]No.
[113:49.87]What the hell was that?
[113:50.87]I think we survived.
[113:56.68]Did we win?
[113:57.64]Did we get our cool?
[113:58.45]Wait, we got all three, right?
[114:01.17]Escape through the bridge of shadows.
[114:05.07]Cool.
[114:07.83]What, what?
[114:09.81]How did that happen?
[114:11.65]Is that you?
[114:12.31]No, he just like fell down.
[114:15.11]Wait, did he fall?
[114:16.25]Where is he?
[114:17.55]No, he's down here.
[114:18.17]He's good.
[114:18.94]You're the only one up there.
[114:19.78]So don't get caught or else we're going to leave you.
[114:22.20]That's exactly, you're gone.
[114:23.94]Sorry.
[114:24.60]You don't get to complete the mission.
[114:28.54]Congratulations.
[114:31.56]I hope you get no loot for that run.
[114:45.52]He's speechless.
[114:48.36]Made it through the entire mission, jumped off some stairs and died.
[114:55.60]The rage is palpable right now.
[114:57.62]He's probably drinking some almond milk.
[114:59.18]Some almond milk.
[115:04.60]No, I'm fine.
[115:05.52]Because we got three tombs.
[115:08.83]We got three tombs.
[115:09.57]We're fine.
[115:10.41]We got the tombs.
[115:11.89]And we got a loot die.
[115:12.65]Look at this.
[115:12.95]We're like level six chest.
[115:16.37]General strong box.
[115:20.06]What do we get for the three tomes?
[115:21.14]Do you get, like, extra chests?
[115:22.56]You get more loot box experience points to level... This guy was a good player.
[115:27.14]He was a good player.
[115:31.02]Excellent work.
[115:32.06]He almost had... Okay.
[115:33.78]Well, no, he has a gun, too.
[115:34.68]Never mind.
[115:36.67]Look at this guy.
[115:38.87]You can be the AIDS guy again.
[115:40.91]I'll be the revive guy again.
[115:43.23]And the storm vermin kill.
[115:44.29]I got the exact same two.
[115:45.97]Okay.
[115:48.77]Carried.
[115:50.11]Carried again.
[115:51.35]Whatever.
[115:52.68]He makes us look good.
[115:54.64]Yeah, he looks good.
[115:55.58]As long as we don't, you know, die at the end of a mission when there's literally no threat to our lives.
[116:00.82]Hey, Matherin!
[116:01.30]There he is.
[116:02.14]Thanks for the game, dude.
[116:04.85]He's actually in the chat.
[116:05.95]There he is.
[116:06.31]Alright, give me a sec.
[116:10.63]Matherin, very good work, man.
[116:12.11]You did a great job.
[116:16.95]he's a real part wait wait hold on about it oh this is green that means something else right let's do it the way that uh hearthstone streamer would do it ready no I mean uh that's right hunting bow okay salvage weapon part alright that's cool now um cool I mean what could be in here something probably in here that's worth picking up I think
[116:43.64]Yeah.
[116:45.44]Could be.
[116:46.86]You know, I could make a deck with Ragnaros maybe if he's in here.
[116:51.86]Reminds me of a story of when I opened up a box one time in Call of Duty 1.
[116:59.26]Inside the box there was a gun in there.
[117:02.26]And it was a rare gun.
[117:03.38]And one of my best friends was over at the time.
[117:05.76]And he wanted me to give it to him through my friends list.
[117:08.34]And I was like, man, easy.
[117:09.84]That's rare.
[117:10.42]What could be in here?
[117:11.04]Shh.
[117:12.73]I wonder if, uh, probably... Okay, let's see.
[117:18.72]Oh, it's a necklace!
[117:25.46]Let's open another pack.
[117:30.15]Alright, open it up.
[117:33.31]Alright, this one was just a general, regular one.
[117:36.58]Green again?
[117:37.16]Oh, damn it.
[117:39.53]That's such a... It's alright.
[117:40.47]We got a green here.
[117:43.79]Man, I haven't been this disappointed in a card pack since maybe like... You guys were here a couple of weeks ago.
[117:48.11]Remember we got like two commons in a rare?
[117:51.53]Oh, that really irritated me.
[117:52.63]And inside... Man.
[117:54.10]We're going to do this one first.
[117:58.04]Alright, fine.
[117:58.48]People are actually getting fucking annoyed.
[118:02.82]I didn't even mute.
[118:03.56]Etalyx is probably fucking pissed off.
[118:06.50]Okay, I did get a rare, though.
[118:09.92]I'm pretty excited right now.
[118:11.28]Okay, I didn't mute.
[118:12.26]Hopefully, I wasn't just pissing you off.
[118:14.62]I was muted, so I could not hear you.
[118:16.02]Okay, good.
[118:18.16]Why?
[118:18.38]Were you saying something?
[118:19.32]I was doing something.
[118:20.12]I was actually making people very angry.
[118:23.72]Would it make me angry?
[118:24.94]No, you'd probably laugh at it.
[118:26.98]I can't use my green.
[118:28.62]It's for the different... Okay, so you unlock gear relevant to your career, not necessarily relevant to the actual hero you have picked.
[118:37.41]It's like, I got a weapon for the next guy that you unlock at level 7.
[118:44.63]Though, this actual... Okay, you know in Diablo II, when an item... Oh, your favorite video game?
[118:52.13]My favorite video game.
[118:53.03]You know in Diablo II how there's a roll between a certain percentage?
[118:55.81]So I have a green and it's, oh, 7.6% attack speed.
[118:58.81]That can roll 2 to 10%.
[119:00.55]Yeah, the properties all have a random... Yeah, they all have a roll in between.
[119:05.43]God, just like Diablo II.
[119:07.78]Let's talk about Diablo II.
[119:09.68]No.
[119:09.86]Because we can really make some people angry with that.
[119:11.88]Why?
[119:12.24]Why would we do that?
[119:12.82]What are you talking about?
[119:14.00]Uh...
[119:15.29]because let's not go there.
[119:19.83]The bow is much better now.
[119:20.73]That's good.
[119:22.13]What do you mean, let's not go there?
[119:23.91]What are you talking about?
[119:25.55]Why is that such a sour subject?
[119:27.77]Your opinion won't make people angry.
[119:29.25]There's certain questions I could ask that would spark a conversation that would end up talking about Diablo II for too long, and that would make people angry.
[119:38.97]I'm ready to answer that question.
[119:41.57]Jerma did his doctorate on Diablo II.
[119:49.03]knows a lot about it alright so let's um let's do it again let's do the third mission you came here with the rats and you're not getting any we just completed a mission we'll go let's go go go quick dude hurry up go before that guy leaves there's a guy in chat there's a guy in chat that's like we need to go now otherwise he's gonna leave the stream
[120:09.91]Otherwise he's going to leave the stream.
[120:11.43]Yes, he was like, dude, I was looking for rats and I'm not getting any.
[120:14.19]What the fuck?
[120:14.65]There's like a bunch of people at the ticket booth right now that aren't getting their tickets.
[120:19.54]The booth is open.
[120:23.84]Alright, join it.
[120:24.94]It's open.
[120:25.62]We're open for business now.
[120:26.94]I just fucking bit my... God damn it.
[120:30.30]What did you say to make everyone so angry?
[120:31.56]I just drank out of a straw and bit my tongue and lip.
[120:35.90]My lip at the same time as my tongue.
[120:37.78]And the straw pissed out all of my mouth and face.
[120:42.15]What the fuck?
[120:44.99]What did I say?
[120:45.43]I don't know.
[120:45.77]I don't remember.
[120:48.23]Okay.
[120:49.31]Okay, hold on.
[120:49.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[120:50.31]Hold on a minute.
[120:51.97]When you're talking about people that are carrying us, this guy's level 15.
[120:57.06]We can't compare to this right now.
[120:59.24]Level 15.
[121:01.84]Oh.
[121:03.10]Yeah, that's true.
[121:04.18]He is playing on recruit difficulty.
[121:06.34]Look, this is level 9.
[121:07.26]Look, I'm already getting carried here.
[121:08.84]None of this even matters anyways.
[121:10.06]When the game unlocks in like four days, that's when you can see the real fireworks.
[121:13.72]That's serious.
[121:16.54]Yeah, these people have probably been grinding for like weeks now.
[121:20.51]No, not that long.
[121:23.75]I don't know.
[121:24.73]When I pre-ordered over a week ago, you could get in the beta.
[121:28.36]Really?
[121:28.60]Yeah.
[121:30.81]I like that there's 93 shots in this one.
[121:32.67]Alright, this is the only mission... Are we going to roleplay this one?
[121:37.71]No.
[121:39.03]This is the only... That was very matter-of-fact.
[121:41.74]This is the only one we haven't done.
[121:43.86]I've had reports of rock blood foraging.
[121:48.29]I want to do at least one that's on the harder difficulty.
[121:50.43]I want to see how much harder it is.
[121:51.49]I mean, this is the first mission we did, the one that A, maxed out my CPU every time I'm here, so looking forward to that, and B, we got beat in about five minutes, so.
[122:02.20]Yeah, well, we didn't, we just, that's the first time we loaded the game up.
[122:04.84]But I'm saying this is harder.
[122:06.18]Like, we, this is like turning the difficulty up.
[122:09.74]I guess, maybe.
[122:16.65]I'm actually a digging dwarf.
[122:19.89]How do you make me talk about Diablo?
[122:23.11]You just talk about Diablo.
[122:24.03]I mean, you don't have to make me talk about Diablo.
[122:26.61]Just talk about why Diablo II is so much better than Diablo 3 ever was.
[122:30.35]I mean, I could talk about why I think that the latest Necromancer update was the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[122:36.42]Okay, but answer this yes or no.
[122:37.72]Do you agree that Diablo II is better than Diablo 3 in any patch ever was?
[122:45.06]I mean, Diablo II is just a better game.
[122:48.53]It's a much more interesting video game.
[122:49.83]Tell us why.
[122:50.81]Why?
[122:51.03]What do you mean, why?
[122:52.65]How much time do you have?
[122:53.57]How much time do we have?
[122:55.87]Oh, I could go all day, first of all.
[122:58.61]I see what's going on here.
[123:00.41]I see what you're doing.
[123:02.05]Yeah, I see.
[123:02.90]That's smart.
[123:05.69]No, um... The Necromancer update being $15 for a character, which... By the way, Reaper of Souls was $30.
[123:16.08]And that was an entire expansion.
[123:17.60]They added, like, a zone and a dumb character to the game.
[123:20.30]And it was like, please give us half the money that it was for the last expansion.
[123:26.48]I don't disagree with you.
[123:28.38]But I have very... Very strong memories.
[123:32.15]There was one time where...
[123:35.08]I was convinced to play Diablo II because of how much better it was after a long, and I didn't enjoy it because I feel... Normie.
[123:44.22]One of the reasons why Diablo II is the greatest game is specifically for people who played it close to its release within five years.
[123:52.47]Yeah, no, I'm just, yeah, it's true.
[123:54.65]Watch out for this guy.
[123:56.27]We got a problem here.
[123:58.60]Yeah, the problem is this level sucks.
[124:02.25]I'm feeling the lag now.
[124:03.69]You're getting lagged out?
[124:05.36]I'm noticing this doesn't have any zoom.
[124:07.52]That's what's throwing me off.
[124:08.70]This doesn't have any zoom.
[124:14.90]Well, that's a fire.
[124:19.99]You know, eventually, at some point, Blizzard's going to make a Diablo 4.
[124:23.49]And I really don't hope they don't do Diablo 4.
[124:25.71]I'm not convinced Blizzard's gonna keep making games.
[124:27.72]I feel like they're gonna go the Valve way at some point.
[124:30.64]Yeah, but somebody has to make a new Diablo.
[124:33.12]Look, Deckard Cain... Deckard Cain, like, pissed in a jug.
[124:35.96]And... It's gonna get somebody pregnant.
[124:40.60]Then Diablo's gonna inherit that person's body.
[124:43.84]And Deckard Cain's, like, pissed son is gonna have Diablo implanted into his face.
[124:49.23]And then we're gonna get Diablo 4.
[124:53.53]You're gonna get, like, a Diablo... I mean, I know you would love this, but you're gonna get a Diablo II, like, HD before you get... I welcome that, actually.
[125:01.05]I really do.
[125:01.49]I hope they do that.
[125:02.11]But, okay, would you rather have them just update the textures or, like, redo the visuals?
[125:08.45]No, I'd rather... I'd rather just remaster the whole game.
[125:11.50]Pull a, like, Shadow of the Colossus.
[125:12.90]Just remake the whole game.
[125:13.96]Okay, that's what I was getting at.
[125:14.84]Do you want, like, a Shadow of the Colossus or do you want, like, a Age of Empires?
[125:22.13]Well, I never played Age of Empires, so I don't know that reference.
[125:25.03]They just upgraded the textures to like 4K and kept everything more or less the same.
[125:29.96]So you want like 3D?
[125:31.78]I mean, no, not necessarily.
[125:33.30]It would be nice if they, because there's a lot of broken shit in Diablo II.
[125:36.50]There is.
[125:37.82]Some of those abilities, some of the characters are just face roll.
[125:41.92]If you do Blizzard Sorceress, or Cold... Hold on.
[125:45.94]I'm getting grabbed by that guy that's in fucking Dark Souls 3.
[125:51.62]You know exactly who it is.
[125:53.24]Is it the one?
[125:54.07]It's the guy in Dark Souls 3.
[125:55.55]It's the fat lady that goes like... You know exactly who it is.
[126:01.25]Everybody does.
[126:01.73]Did you just... Oh, no.
[126:02.81]Someone else walked into that.
[126:07.41]Did you walk into it next?
[126:08.73]Yes, I did.
[126:15.29]Yeah, and then it goes... What did she say?
[126:16.43]She goes... Right by the court of storms.
[126:22.53]What did she say?
[126:24.06]Would you rather them do Skyrim or Shadow of the Colossus?
[126:29.40]No, don't do Skyrim.
[126:30.84]What do you mean, would I rather do Skyrim?
[126:33.43]What are you talking about?
[126:35.43]No, that's not what they do.
[126:36.65]No, you're getting it wrong.
[126:38.25]Sorry, it's the same textures.
[126:40.17]No, it's just on a new console and they put in... Do you want to be able to play Diablo II on your iPad?
[126:47.20]I thought you were going to say Skyrim.
[126:49.42]I can't wait until Skyrim iOS comes out.
[126:52.84]It's gonna happen eventually.
[126:54.66]That's gonna be awesome.
[126:58.03]Skyrim iOS.
[126:59.77]It's gonna happen.
[127:00.35]Touch controls.
[127:03.07]Just wait.
[127:03.51]They haven't made phones good enough for Skyrim yet.
[127:07.46]Guess what?
[127:08.10]Skyrim don't look that good anyways.
[127:09.68]It doesn't need to be that great.
[127:10.70]What is on his back?
[127:11.44]Is he a rat on his back?
[127:12.54]Oh my.
[127:13.08]We got problems on the right flank.
[127:15.43]He's dead.
[127:16.98]No, that's not the problem.
[127:18.96]When are they going to put Skyrim on a microwave?
[127:23.36]I want Skyrim on a calculator.
[127:25.44]No, I just want them to stop making Skyrim.
[127:28.85]Make another one.
[127:31.13]Make The Elder Scrolls VI.
[127:34.21]What are they at?
[127:35.17]V?
[127:36.09]No, don't even do VI.
[127:37.07]Have it be over.
[127:38.86]Make another game.
[127:41.68]Companies need to stop making Call of Duties.
[127:43.92]You know what I mean?
[127:44.40]Just make another game.
[127:45.34]Do something else.
[127:49.55]You hear that, Blizzard Activision?
[127:51.95]Stop making Call of Duty.
[127:53.51]Do something else.
[127:55.39]Stop making fucking Madden.
[127:56.83]Like Tony Hawk.
[127:58.58]Tony Hawk stopped at three.
[128:00.34]No, wait, there's like 12 Tony Hawk games.
[128:02.10]That's a terrible analogy.
[128:03.48]Stop making Tony Hawk games.
[128:06.10]I think they finally stopped making Tony Hawk games.
[128:09.75]Look, it's the analogy.
[128:11.25]Listen to me.
[128:11.65]Everybody listen.
[128:12.95]You guys ever seen the movie Saw?
[128:15.45]Uh, stop at the first Saw.
[128:16.81]No, but don't, no, no, no, I'm just saying, like, every, like, Jigsaw just came out last year.
[128:21.11]There's like nine Saw movies.
[128:22.41]Did you watch it?
[128:23.15]Yes, it was awful.
[128:25.99]Did you not know it was gonna be awful before you watched it?
[128:28.39]No, I do, I just, I like those movies.
[128:29.88]Or did you go watch it because it was awful?
[128:32.32]I like Call of Duty, I like horror Call of Duty, okay?
[128:35.44]Hey guys, listen.
[128:35.98]Jason, listen.
[128:36.80]Call of Duty, stop making Call of Duty, kinda like Saw movies, which this man went to see.
[128:43.07]So do as I say, not as I do.
[128:45.27]You understand?
[128:46.89]Stop making this trash content that you know is gonna be trash, and then you consume it anyway.
[128:52.95]Look, I had to go.
[128:55.49]Every Saw movie, I've been forced to go.
[128:57.15]Look, if you put a controller in my hands, and Call of Duty was on the screen, and you were like, play this game, Jeremy, I'd be like, okay!
[129:09.89]Anyways, the point I'm making is, like Jason, right?
[129:14.13]They made a bunch of Jason movies.
[129:16.91]Jason Bourne, right?
[129:18.77]Oh, that is not where I thought you were taking that.
[129:22.16]Multiple Jasons.
[129:22.84]There's two different Jasons they've made a bunch of different Jason movies on.
[129:25.04]I thought you were talking about the horror movie Jason, considering we were just talking about Saw.
[129:29.64]I was.
[129:31.98]So, Jason Bourne, Jason Voorhees...
[129:35.56]But didn't they stop Statham?
[129:36.84]Jason Statham?
[129:37.46]No, no, I got a better idea.
[129:38.62]Stop making movies with fucking Jason in them, okay?
[129:41.20]Jason Statham, Jason Bourne, Jason Voorhees.
[129:43.32]Give me a break.
[129:43.86]Just the name Jason.
[129:45.22]No more Jasons.
[129:45.90]That's a very 90s, 2000s name.
[129:46.80]It's a little crowded up here on this.
[129:56.97]Watch out.
[129:57.73]Like, this is not gonna... Stop making movies.
[130:01.67]They didn't just stop making movies entirely.
[130:05.10]Our children need to go outside.
[130:07.96]We need to have our generation.
[130:08.88]The next generation is to go outside and play fucking tetherball.
[130:12.19]Way too rough.
[130:13.87]You know what I mean?
[130:14.63]The tetherball hits you right in the face and you get a bruise.
[130:19.41]I could show you a bruise on my face that I got from tetherball when I was like nine.
[130:24.43]The thing spun around.
[130:25.41]You know when you play tetherball and it wraps around really quickly?
[130:28.69]It goes too quick and it just like a blender spins around the pole.
[130:31.93]I was standing right there and it bang!
[130:33.53]Hit me right in the face.
[130:35.00]I got blended by the tetherball.
[130:36.08]Hey, you know what?
[130:38.54]I'm that much more of a person.
[130:39.72]I'm that much more well-rounded.
[130:51.84]You have us the same, Bruce, for 21 years?
[130:54.24]Yeah, I probably need to go get that checked.
[131:01.12]Now, yeah, it's a dent.
[131:03.98]I have a dent in my head now.
[131:06.08]Yeah, you know, if I... Hold on, wait.
[131:07.66]I gotta, like, kill a pig.
[131:09.06]No, I'm not.
[131:09.50]That's mean.
[131:12.06]You know pigs are the most intelligent animals on the Earth?
[131:16.73]Don't kill any pigs.
[131:17.87]Pigs are smarter than dolphins.
[131:18.89]Did you guys know that?
[131:21.75]Oh, fuck.
[131:27.13]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[131:37.24]I really tried.
[131:41.18]Oh, he got collapsed.
[131:42.84]Excuse me.
[131:46.58]Dolphins are pretty dumb and evil.
[131:48.16]What?
[131:50.26]That's not true.
[131:54.35]Are you basing your dolphin hypothesis on the Guardians of the Galaxy?
[131:59.57]No, what was it called?
[132:00.73]Hitchhiker's Guardians of the Guide of the Galaxy.
[132:04.26]Guide to the Guardians of the Hitchhikers of the Galaxy, whatever the fucking movie's called.
[132:14.99]How do we get out of here?
[132:22.18]You haven't even seen Flipper?
[132:23.64]That was an interesting time to come back in.
[132:27.44]Uh, we gotta reach the orchard.
[132:33.14]We do, yeah.
[132:33.72]It's that way.
[132:34.16]And there's a horde that way too now.
[132:36.50]Ooh, that was an air shot.
[132:44.42]What is going on here?
[132:45.12]That is so cool.
[132:46.77]That was like a rapid fire, uh, fire machine gun thing.
[132:50.51]He's doing like a super spell.
[132:52.69]Nice vocabulary.
[132:54.57]Rapid fire thing!
[132:55.63]Machine gun super spell!
[132:57.93]I'm in the fourth grade!
[133:00.72]It's a staff version of the the mage like the level of the fire mage Is there somebody have an ability that's giving a ton of ammunition somebody doing something here that's doing that We got to go this way, I don't know I
[133:27.47]But anyways, alright, wait, wait, wait, let's get a potential opinion on this.
[133:36.14]Okay, a potential one.
[133:37.46]Okay, because I have my top three smartest, and I would like to know what you say as well.
[133:42.54]So I'm going to mute, and I'm going to say it, and then you say it.
[133:45.22]So here we go.
[133:45.82]I'm going to answer the question first.
[133:46.88]Are you muting me?
[133:47.52]No, I'm muting myself, just for like 30 seconds.
[133:51.06]So let's see how smart Etalyx actually is.
[133:53.32]The top three smartest animals in the world.
[133:54.92]Uh, pig is number one.
[133:57.70]A, uh, chimpanzee is number two.
[134:00.32]And number three is a, is a gray, the gray eagle.
[134:03.12]No, no, no, the gray bird.
[134:04.08]What's it called?
[134:05.42]The, the gray bird.
[134:06.72]The one that talks.
[134:07.90]The one that, like, is in all the videos of him talking and putting blocks in holes and shit.
[134:12.50]That one.
[134:13.20]Okay, let's see how smart he is.
[134:15.35]Alright, Etalyx, what are the top three most intelligent animals in the world?
[134:19.86]Top three most intelligent animals.
[134:23.80]Okay, I can't think of a third one, but I can give you two at least.
[134:28.79]Number one, mice.
[134:32.17]Number two, dolphins.
[134:33.63]Wait, hold on.
[134:36.06]Dolphins wasn't even on my list.
[134:40.00]He said, okay, very matter of factly.
[134:42.68]Like, oh yeah, yeah, I got that one too.
[134:45.00]And number three, maybe like gorillas.
[134:48.50]Okay, well, that's pretty good.
[134:51.18]I was trying to say dolphins weren't even on my list.
[134:53.63]I mean, I'm assuming we're not talking like humans are discounted from this, right?
[134:57.55]Yes.
[134:57.73]Or is humans one of the options?
[134:58.77]Humans are discounted.
[135:00.37]Okay.
[135:03.33]What did I say?
[135:03.81]What did you get?
[135:04.81]Uh, mine was number one was pig.
[135:07.23]Pig?
[135:07.63]Pigs are the number one most intelligent animal.
[135:09.60]Two is chimpanzee.
[135:11.64]And three was that the gray bird that talks.
[135:14.66]The one that's... The gray bird?
[135:16.10]You know what I'm talking about?
[135:17.06]The gray bird that talks.
[135:17.78]Oh, crows?
[135:18.50]No, no, no, no.
[135:19.04]That's a black bird.
[135:20.18]I forgot about crows.
[135:21.74]No, it's called like the... It's the gray... Just type in gray smart bird into Google.
[135:26.44]That's what I'm talking about.
[135:27.18]Gray smart bird?
[135:28.39]It's smarter than a crow?
[135:29.39]Yes.
[135:29.85]The thing can put in... It can do like basic math.
[135:33.12]What?
[135:33.66]Yes.
[135:35.38]I swear to God, it can do basic math and it can talk.
[135:38.30]It can do basic math.
[135:39.40]It can talk.
[135:40.32]It can eat a Big Mac real quick.
[135:44.37]Gray Macaw, is that what it is?
[135:50.05]That was satisfying.
[135:54.12]It's not a parrot, though.
[135:55.06]It's a very specific kind of parrot.
[135:57.14]Is it an African parrot?
[135:58.30]African gray parrot.
[135:59.36]There it is.
[135:59.78]That's the smartest animal in the world.
[136:02.36]If only you were an African gray parrot, then you would have remembered that.
[136:05.40]I would be able to count to three.
[136:09.60]Oh boy.
[136:17.81]No, there's a lot of talking parrots.
[136:20.63]This happens to be the smartest of all the talking parrots.
[136:25.34]It's not a parrot.
[136:26.20]It is, but it isn't.
[136:38.72]I don't know why I keep coming down to, like, carve the monster.
[136:41.40]So who's right?
[136:42.18]Like, if somebody looks, who's correct?
[136:44.64]Who's more correct?
[136:45.50]Actually, the smartest animal in the world is the Border Collie.
[136:48.36]Are you sure it's not Mice?
[136:49.66]It's not Mice.
[136:50.42]Mice are, like, stupid.
[136:51.78]Mice are not the smartest animal in the world.
[136:53.77]It's Border Collie is number one.
[136:56.15]Are you sure?
[136:57.49]I'm sure that Mice are not even in the top 20.
[137:00.33]But, like, I'm pretty sure that's the whole joke of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, isn't it?
[137:05.47]Is that the whole joke?
[137:06.53]Is that Mice are actually the smartest creature in the world?
[137:09.63]No, but... That's why they're the mastermind?
[137:16.87]Mice are smart, but they're not in, like, top 30.
[137:18.43]I would put mice underneath.
[137:20.01]I don't know.
[137:21.87]I'm pretty sure it's mice.
[137:22.89]I don't know, man.
[137:23.33]It might be hippos.
[137:24.11]I'd put mice underneath hippos any day.
[137:25.90]Hippos?
[137:26.48]Yeah.
[137:27.98]No, no, wait.
[137:28.32]That's the most... Sorry, sorry.
[137:29.60]That's the most aggressive, mean animal in the world.
[137:32.12]I forgot.
[137:32.60]Yeah, that's the one you're thinking of.
[137:34.62]Okay, he is way the fuck away from us.
[137:40.91]I like this perch, though.
[137:43.23]Just shot a shadow.
[137:43.99]That's good.
[137:44.33]Right in the head.
[137:50.05]Double it up.
[137:54.28]Number one is chimpanzee.
[137:56.02]Number two is dolphin.
[137:57.70]Okay.
[137:58.46]Number three is orangutan.
[138:00.62]Yeah, but like, okay, remove the monkeys.
[138:06.00]What's number three besides monkeys?
[138:08.28]What's like two, five, and seven?
[138:11.14]Because there's going to be like three different types.
[138:13.38]I believe it's 14.
[138:17.19]Dolphins are number two, so I was right.
[138:19.17]I was originally correct.
[138:21.61]But I put dolphins at number two.
[138:23.37]Did you?
[138:24.33]Yeah, in the original, so I actually have a point.
[138:26.45]Alright, where's African gray parrot on that list?
[138:28.69]Is it one?
[138:32.53]Elephants.
[138:33.99]Yeah, but elephants aren't that smart.
[138:35.05]They can just remember everything.
[138:36.51]Weren't elephants my number three?
[138:38.07]No, elephants were your number three.
[138:40.47]You did not say elephant.
[138:41.56]No, you didn't.
[138:42.30]What was his third one?
[138:43.58]What was my third one, Chad?
[138:47.14]I'm pretty... You're protecting your ass, don't worry.
[138:49.72]I'm going to turn all my settings to low and see if that helps.
[138:56.12]Oh, you said ape.
[138:56.98]You said like a gorilla.
[138:59.19]Did I?
[138:59.71]Yes.
[139:01.92]He said gorilla.
[139:06.64]Which, I mean... We're putting that in the monkey list.
[139:10.98]Yeah, yeah, but I mean... There's still two.
[139:13.68]Okay, where's African Gray Parrot and Pig?
[139:17.51]What am I doing?
[139:18.03]I was trying to kill those things in there.
[139:19.41]Elephants have funerals, recognize different human languages, and think people are cute.
[139:25.53]So doesn't a goldfish.
[139:28.29]I can't help this person.
[139:30.00]I got it.
[139:33.08]Pick him up.
[139:38.76]Hi there.
[139:43.26]African... An African grey pig.
[139:46.91]That would be the most intelligent animal in the world.
[139:50.31]Some scientist wants to do some cloning shit here.
[139:52.43]Forget about sheep.
[139:53.61]Combine a pig, a dolphin, an African grey parrot, and an elephant.
[140:02.95]Goldfish do have funerals.
[140:07.09]Elephant's speaking- I'm being pulled.
[140:08.15]Okay.
[140:14.78]That's not cloning?
[140:16.28]Yeah, you would clone their DNA and then put it together.
[140:18.26]There's two different machines in this iPad game.
[140:20.58]First you pull out- Wait, what are we cloning?
[140:22.04]The animals.
[140:22.40]First you pull out the DNA, make sure you have enough of the DNA materials to put it into the machine to make the new character, make the new monster.
[140:33.23]And so what was the purpose of this question originally?
[140:38.39]Um... Like... Because all I heard was, alright, I'm going to mute and we're going to ask questions.
[140:48.26]I lost track.
[140:48.96]Was it just you wanted to do trivia?
[140:50.66]I don't know.
[140:51.42]I lost track.
[140:51.88]I don't know.
[140:52.42]There was definitely like... There was a purpose.
[140:54.58]Yeah, there was a purpose for some reason.
[140:55.70]I don't know what it was.
[140:59.48]Can I not shoot through his armor?
[141:01.20]Probably can't.
[141:04.54]Who's the smartest cookie?
[141:06.06]What's the most intelligent cookie?
[141:08.46]That would be a standard, soft, chewy, sugar cookie.
[141:14.32]What did you say?
[141:15.10]Standard scotch?
[141:16.08]No, I said a soft, chewy, sugar cookie is the best, most intelligent cookie.
[141:20.44]Chewy cookies are the worst.
[141:22.08]Oh, boy.
[141:22.92]What did you just fucking say?
[141:24.42]Okay, but I'm talking context stuff.
[141:26.64]Like, if you're getting chips ahoy...
[141:28.96]The Chewy Chips Ahoy are the worst cookies.
[141:31.16]No, you're not a crispy cookie guy, are you?
[141:34.63]Are you a crunchy, crispy, crunchy cookie guy?
[141:37.89]If it's store-bought, yes.
[141:39.45]If it's homemade, no.
[141:40.69]Oh, man.
[141:42.23]Store-bought cookies, all crunchy.
[141:44.29]Homemade cookies, all soft and right out of the oven.
[141:46.87]Soft and chewy otherwise.
[141:48.12]Like, get the fuck out of here.
[141:49.92]You know what I mean?
[141:51.92]There is not a single good store-bought chewy cookie.
[141:55.46]Excuse me.
[141:56.08]That's where I'm going to have to correct you here.
[141:59.59]Entenmann's.
[142:01.95]What?
[142:02.37]Entenmann's.
[142:04.23]Entenmann's is the best.
[142:06.18]Is that like some northern thing?
[142:07.44]I don't know.
[142:07.96]What is it?
[142:08.60]It's in like every supermarket that I've ever been to.
[142:12.26]Boston?
[142:13.08]Is it a Boston thing?
[142:15.46]It's an Entenmann's thing.
[142:19.00]Entenmann's.
[142:20.16]It's very intimate.
[142:21.51]No, E-N.
[142:24.13]Yeah, intimate.
[142:26.68]It's an intimate cookie.
[142:28.74]Yeah, they have more than just cookies.
[142:30.20]They have everything.
[142:32.16]They have sponge cake.
[142:33.42]Don't ignore the subway cookies.
[142:35.01]That's not what I'm talking about when I say store-bought, okay?
[142:37.55]They make those.
[142:38.15]No, they don't.
[142:39.49]I'm talking about packaged in the back of a truck.
[142:41.15]They get those off the back of a fucking truck, yeah.
[142:44.53]Yeah, they do.
[142:45.01]Those subway cookies come out of a truck.
[142:46.49]They come out of a bag.
[142:47.45]I don't know.
[142:49.05]I don't know.
[142:51.67]Would you consider that store-bought?
[142:54.15]If I told you I was gonna go get some store-bought food and then I brought home Subway, would you say, like, oh, hmm, I was expecting something from, like, Walmart.
[143:02.70]Hold on, no, no, no, excuse me.
[143:04.48]Store-bought food.
[143:05.94]You could be describing anything.
[143:08.42]It's a store.
[143:08.88]You know what I mean when I say store-bought, right?
[143:11.36]Yeah, I brought back some store.
[143:12.97]I bought these at a store.
[143:14.53]There's no reason for everyone to be pedantic about that.
[143:16.91]A restaurant could be a store.
[143:19.26]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[143:20.91]But, like, you have to admit a restaurant dessert is not the same as a store-bought quote-unquote dessert.
[143:26.97]Yeah, well, it actually depends.
[143:28.67]Because if you're talking about... You might be talking about, like, one of these chain restaurants that everything comes out of a bag and comes out of a box.
[143:37.01]So, you're talking about a cookie that came from, like, the Olive Garden?
[143:40.91]Because if you got a cookie from the Olive Garden, it was definitely in the back of a truck.
[143:45.15]A cookie from the Olive Garden.
[143:46.91]Yeah, or are you talking about a cookie from a, like, a nice established restaurant, like, owned and operated, and they make everything there?
[143:54.76]Like, you're not talking about, like, a Chili's, right?
[143:58.62]No, but, I mean, wouldn't you rather have, like, a chocolate volcano cake from a Chili's than buying it in a plastic container from Walmart?
[144:06.70]No.
[144:08.10]Really?
[144:10.60]Really?
[144:11.02]I don't- I kind of- I'm kind of biased.
[144:14.12]I kind of fucking hate chilis.
[144:15.54]Chilis suck.
[144:16.20]I do too, but still.
[144:18.68]So you'd buy- Oh, come on.
[144:19.96]You'd rather have like a chocolate upside-down pineapple upside-down cake from chilis?
[144:24.24]From chilis than from Walmart, yeah.
[144:25.96]Why?
[144:26.36]You're gonna be paying more money for the thing that's in Walmart.
[144:29.78]They get it from Walmart.
[144:30.78]They open it out of the box and they put it on a plate and give it to you for like an extra four dollars.
[144:36.47]That guy extra died.
[144:41.13]Oh, my.
[144:41.65]These particles, though.
[144:42.63]Yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on here.
[144:45.81]Who is doing that?
[144:47.13]I think it's the mage.
[144:50.27]With those fire skills.
[144:52.03]Oh, that's not good.
[144:53.07]Run.
[144:56.53]I know Chili sucks.
[144:57.94]I'm not disagreeing there.
[145:00.38]It's just a would-you-rather question.
[145:02.58]Oh, by the way, that's how Robert Ackendown says that guy.
[145:05.71]That's what?
[145:07.56]Everyone knows what I'm talking about.
[145:08.62]That was Robert Ackendown.
[145:09.80]Look him up.
[145:10.14]Is he in this game?
[145:11.48]Yeah, of course he is.
[145:12.36]He's in every single video game ever made.
[145:17.57]I've never been to Walmart.
[145:18.71]What are you talking about?
[145:22.30]He's like Bill Gates.
[145:25.06]Never had to do his own shopping.
[145:26.84]Somebody else does it for me.
[145:29.21]I just go upstairs and there's food in the fridge.
[145:31.99]It's weird.
[145:33.71]No one's ever explained to me how or why.
[145:38.17]You make this joke every stream.
[145:41.15]Wait, what?
[145:41.77]What joke?
[145:43.40]What joke do we make every stream?
[145:44.42]Uh...
[145:50.59]The Robert Atkins, no, I'm just making it up.
[145:52.31]That's not a joke.
[145:53.29]I actually think that's him.
[145:54.67]That's not me making a joke or anything.
[145:57.85]He's just in every game.
[145:59.33]So what else has he done?
[146:02.13]Everything.
[146:03.15]It's the medic from TF2.
[146:04.37]Oh, okay.
[146:07.67]That explains it.
[146:08.53]I missed everybody.
[146:12.72]I don't think I've used my special this entire round.
[146:16.85]I'm actually not a big fan of the Archer special.
[146:20.24]It's kind of just triple Hanzo.
[146:27.44]By the way, I love how I continue to make Overwatch references every two or three streams, and I haven't played the game in over a year.
[146:45.33]uh watch it oh wow that was nice nice job nice work hard to see right now kind of hard to see there's so much blood popping up it's hard to even know what blood is coming from what character it might be my blood I don't even know
[147:18.87]Can't push him.
[147:22.05]Okay.
[147:24.59]We've almost rescued all the barbarians in Diablo II.
[147:27.33]Oh no.
[147:34.93]Here come the rats.
[147:42.10]That works.
[147:43.30]Oh, watch out, watch out.
[147:43.90]There's one.
[147:45.64]Ah.
[147:47.48]I'm good.
[147:53.58]Not a time for the ranged, that's for sure.
[148:00.81]Holy shit.
[148:03.81]I can't even tell what's happening.
[148:06.25]Oh my god.
[148:06.99]There's no rhyme or reason to this.
[148:09.15]It's just happening.
[148:12.64]That's the only thing I know.
[148:14.26]Here's the commentary I can give you right now, guys.
[148:16.56]This is happening.
[148:17.70]That's it.
[148:26.84]When are you going to play killing?
[148:32.00]That was a nice grenade.
[148:35.57]This character is awesome.
[148:39.03]I want a new character.
[148:39.79]Oh, shit.
[148:49.33]Alright, good.
[148:55.95]This used to be a Stanley Parable stream.
[148:59.17]What are you talking about?
[149:06.72]Sorry.
[149:07.48]I was ranting.
[149:09.42]What were you ranting about?
[149:10.16]Why are you not including me in your rants?
[149:12.04]Because I don't want you guys to have to be subject to my why am I getting 30 frames per second rant.
[149:17.54]Why not?
[149:18.22]We're here for you.
[149:18.78]We're here to help.
[149:19.36]Because I don't understand.
[149:20.32]And I'm talking about how I have to get a new computer.
[149:24.16]Oh.
[149:27.37]Oh, I got a bow.
[149:34.66]But I can't get a new computer until people stop mining Bitcoin.
[149:38.86]You're mining Bitcoin on your computer?
[149:40.44]No, like new graphics cards are like twice as expensive as what they are supposed to be.
[149:46.97]Oh, because people are just filling a computer with like 30 of them.
[149:50.63]Supply and demand.
[149:51.51]You didn't know about this?
[149:52.19]Supply and demand has actually made like all even recent graphics cards twice as much as they normally are.
[149:58.52]So a $700, like 1080i.
[150:01.60]I know, man.
[150:04.26]It's almost like we need a different solution to the cryptocurrencies and the problem of proof of work.
[150:10.52]It's almost as if BurstCoin would be a really good solution to that.
[150:17.81]Which is not proof of work, it's proof of capacity.
[150:21.46]This guy doesn't know his shit.
[150:23.60]Proof of capacity.
[150:26.02]Well, I did awful.
[150:27.40]No, I'm the eighth guy.
[150:30.80]I didn't do that.
[150:31.52]Actually, I did way better than you.
[150:32.60]It's hard to kill things.
[150:33.22]I did twice as good as you.
[150:34.54]You almost did twice as good as me, yeah.
[150:38.00]To be fair, pickaxe kind of sucks.
[150:42.43]Oh, well.
[150:42.77]Does it?
[150:44.13]Yeah, I would probably buy a new computer within the next three months if graphics cards were not $1,500.
[150:49.69]That's insane.
[150:50.49]The $1,500?
[150:50.73]Alright, let's see.
[150:51.63]1080, EVGA, SC2.
[150:52.01]Toolkit.
[150:56.30]What do these even do?
[150:56.98]Cool.
[151:13.48]Why did I say 1080i?
[151:14.62]You know what I mean.
[151:17.74]I got a 1080.
[151:18.36]Hold on a second.
[151:18.94]How much is a regular 1080 right now?
[151:22.06]A regular 1080 is $650.
[151:24.08]A GTX 1080 SE2 is $650.
[151:29.47]What's the new top-of-the-line one?
[151:31.61]TI.
[151:32.03]The TIs.
[151:32.95]Is it the TI?
[151:33.41]I thought it was something else.
[151:34.17]No.
[151:34.61]Isn't it like the Titan Pascal or something?
[151:36.69]Titans are always a little bit higher.
[151:40.47]I need to look at this.
[151:41.48]But the 1080 Ti SC2 is $1,300 on Newegg.
[151:47.04]Interesting.
[151:49.08]By the way, I'm not condoning.
[151:50.70]This is not investment advice.
[151:54.62]You have to say that every time you say anything.
[151:57.88]I'm not giving investment advice.
[151:59.08]I'm not a financial advisor.
[152:00.65]You can't sue me.
[152:01.47]Don't even try.
[152:01.87]$28,000.
[152:01.89]That's cool.
[152:09.55]Turn off sun shadows and you'll get like 20 more frames.
[152:12.85]Okay.
[152:13.91]I'll try.
[152:14.31]This one's way better.
[152:19.12]Why is this so much better?
[152:22.74]Plus 9.5% power versus infantry.
[152:26.30]So who cares?
[152:27.14]That gets me like an extra like 1.7 damage.
[152:28.80]What did you just do?
[152:29.42]Okay.
[152:29.56]Trinkets.
[152:38.89]This is arguably worse than the thing I have on right now.
[152:46.43]Whatever.
[152:47.69]I think I want to try a new character.
[152:50.03]Or do I?
[152:50.54]I thought about that too, but it resets all your power stats.
[152:55.06]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[152:56.24]58.
[152:59.08]I just want to get to the highest power I can.
[153:01.32]Actually, I think I can use this.
[153:06.79]I'm like, some of my textures aren't loading in.
[153:09.33]Crafting, what do I even do about this?
[153:13.86]I can use this.
[153:17.34]There we go.
[153:17.70]Alright, let me, I see, I gotta pee.
[153:27.17]Alright.
[153:28.63]Can we take a pee break?
[153:30.17]We can take a pee break, yes.
[153:34.45]Alright.
[153:35.07]I'm going to pee.
[153:35.53]I'll be right back.
[153:36.05]Give me like two minutes.
[153:37.58]See you in a sec.
[156:06.83]What are you guys asking?
[156:07.41]What's for dinner?
[156:11.82]There's people saying, what's for dinner?
[156:14.16]I don't know.
[156:15.78]What are you having for dinner?
[156:17.90]That's a great question.
[156:21.60]Don't start talking about food now.
[156:24.82]You literally asked me, what are you going to have for dinner?
[156:28.02]And then you sidelined me and then said, let's not talk about food.
[156:31.44]Let's not talk about dinner.
[156:36.02]Alright, how do you craft stuff in this game?
[156:37.72]Where's my crafting system?
[156:38.76]I want to make a survival base.
[156:40.06]Alright, let's figure it out.
[156:41.28]So, I'm just going to put... Look, it doesn't even fucking matter.
[156:46.06]You know what I'm saying?
[156:48.08]Like, this whole thing's getting wiped anyways.
[156:50.80]It does not matter.
[156:51.70]The only way it matters is if we want to turn up the difficulty for some reason.
[156:55.10]Right, so I don't know what I just did.
[156:58.22]You used to craft?
[157:00.38]This is just materials.
[157:02.58]I guess you can salvage anything.
[157:04.14]It doesn't have to be a full box.
[157:10.97]Green dust.
[157:12.23]Rerolling magical properties.
[157:16.01]How do you salvage things?
[157:20.72]Go to crafting and then just right click and put it in the box.
[157:23.78]Oh, I didn't even see the crafting thing.
[157:25.52]And then there's a next and previous.
[157:26.98]Reroll equipment upgrade item.
[157:30.44]Apply weapon illusion.
[157:34.40]Craft item.
[157:38.60]By using a template.
[157:44.09]Uh... Hold on.
[157:49.21]What if I use... This is a template?
[157:52.35]I can't.
[157:52.67]Alright, here's the template.
[157:55.82]We're gonna craft something.
[157:59.36]Oh, I see.
[158:02.62]You have enough stuff to craft a template?
[158:04.40]Alright, I just did... I just crafted something and I don't know what it was.
[158:10.64]You have to have 10 scrap, right?
[158:12.20]I just did.
[158:12.55]I don't know.
[158:16.22]Okay, cool.
[158:18.62]Crafted it.
[158:19.30]Okay, good job.
[158:20.63]Alright, you ready to do another one?
[158:25.75]So we've done all the missions, right?
[158:28.33]We've done all three missions, yes.
[158:30.21]Can we just not do the third mission?
[158:31.85]Because that's the one that breaks my computer.
[158:33.97]Okay.
[158:35.55]So when can we do the higher... 120.
[158:38.93]Yeah, so when you reset character, you lower your...
[158:44.72]your stats so we're just over like halfway to be I'm at 72. so what is this new item I have I'm actually more than halfway yeah we'll be there soon why am I getting poison on this now that's right take your time that's what our enemies are doing what is this guy can you like pick up potions before you go
[159:13.10]You can probably take these to test out on the target dummy.
[159:15.35]Yeah, definitely.
[159:18.63]Alright, let's... What does Potion of Concentration even do?
[159:23.09]Make your special... Your special recharges super fast.
[159:29.00]Holy shit.
[159:31.54]What are you doing?
[159:32.84]I drank a Potion of Speed.
[159:35.54]Alright, let's disband the group.
[159:37.50]We're going to put another up there and let's do it.
[159:48.48]Join.
[159:50.18]Off me.
[159:52.74]Only 32, 33 shots in this though.
[159:57.05]Let's do another one.
[159:57.61]Let's see where we're at.
[159:59.47]Let's see how fast we can... Let's try to do this one well.
[160:02.65]Try to get some more points.
[160:03.97]Have we not been?
[160:04.61]I mean, I kind of sucked the last one, but that's because I'm chopping down the 30 FPS.
[160:09.29]We're on the level that you have trouble playing on.
[160:15.58]Is that what they call it now?
[160:17.26]I guess.
[160:23.39]Alright, I gotta join off you again.
[160:25.07]Wait, I can just... That was not because of Potion of Speed.
[160:28.14]I apparently can just do that.
[160:33.74]Interesting.
[160:36.32]I think Jerma's mic is getting worse by the minute.
[160:38.56]People don't like the way your mic sounds.
[160:40.05]My mic sounds worse?
[160:40.59]What are you talking about?
[160:41.45]Sounds like you're far away and muffled.
[160:43.21]Far away and muffled?
[160:44.41]What?
[160:44.85]To me.
[160:45.11]Really?
[160:45.93]Really?
[160:47.05]I don't know, maybe it's just the voice, the VoIP that's doing it.
[160:51.43]Is something going weird here?
[160:53.19]How do I sound on my own stream?
[160:57.31]We've got something weird going on here?
[161:00.21]Shouldn't be like that.
[161:05.36]Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know.
[161:07.04]That's what I read.
[161:08.38]It says, you sound normal.
[161:11.21]You sound fine.
[161:14.57]Maybe the voice-activated online protocol is not doing so well.
[161:24.56]Alright, you want to do it again?
[161:25.66]Because you're like the guy that does that.
[161:27.90]Because it's your thing.
[161:30.38]It's my thing.
[161:31.84]So, for people who don't know, in the full game, you don't have to do the same three missions until you grind power level.
[161:39.48]No, you do not.
[161:41.64]This is just for the beta.
[161:43.22]The beta has three missions and five champions?
[161:47.66]I don't think the other ones are unlocked, right?
[161:49.92]Well, the people we were playing with were using them.
[161:52.25]I don't know where they are.
[161:54.11]Alright.
[161:55.31]Because one guy was the bounty hunter, which is tier two.
[161:58.85]And last game, the fire mage, I think, was the tier two fire mage.
[162:02.31]Oh, okay.
[162:03.13]But they're like side grades.
[162:04.24]They're not like direct upgrades.
[162:08.17]What is the full game going to release?
[162:09.97]March 8th, right?
[162:11.77]Yeah, March 8th, I believe.
[162:13.57]So in, I don't know, a couple weeks?
[162:15.87]Two weeks from now, just about?
[162:17.35]A little bit more than that?
[162:20.69]Just over two weeks?
[162:22.27]Two weeks and one day?
[162:28.40]And the queue is open.
[162:31.04]The price in United States dollars is $24.99 currently, right?
[162:34.00]I'm going to change weapons.
[162:37.54]Yeah, I think it's like 25 bucks.
[162:38.68]It might be like a early sale or something on... Like, buy it on release.
[162:44.15]The full... And you get $2 off.
[162:46.53]The full release is gonna have, what, 20... How many levels?
[162:49.77]21 or something?
[162:51.79]I don't know.
[162:52.79]More than that?
[162:53.81]Let's see.
[162:55.57]How many levels?
[162:58.98]In Vermintide 2.
[162:59.72]What are my thoughts on Special K cereal?
[163:08.36]That's... Just eat cornflakes.
[163:11.58]It's the same damn thing.
[163:12.76]They just dumped a powder of vitamin.
[163:14.26]They just opened up a vitamin packet and poured it in.
[163:17.08]That's it.
[163:18.66]Just eat frosted flakes.
[163:19.92]Don't eat too many of them.
[163:20.72]I know they have the marshmallows now.
[163:21.95]That's really, really tempting when you go down the aisle.
[163:24.47]But don't do it.
[163:26.31]It's not even that good either.
[163:27.21]It actually tastes kind of terrible.
[163:28.27]Uh, I can't find out how many missions it has.
[163:33.49]Maybe somebody else knows.
[163:36.83]My Googling is not up to snuff.
[163:38.81]I apparently sound really bad on your stream, I guess, yeah.
[163:42.25]I don't know why.
[163:43.57]I don't know.
[163:46.89]Wait a minute.
[163:47.68]Hold on.
[163:49.16]Wait a second.
[163:50.12]Wait a second.
[163:50.68]Wait a second.
[163:51.48]Am I going through webcam?
[163:53.06]Are we getting into webcam Jerma?
[163:57.88]Thank you, guys.
[163:58.62]For like the last two and a half hours.
[164:02.48]Hello?
[164:03.79]oh my god have you been getting webcam Jerma god yes it's been webcam Jerma the entire stream I just thought your mic was awful for some reason why hold on a second why didn't you tell me that because it did listen okay it's one of those issues where if it if you didn't just swap I honestly there was a thought in my back of my mind that I was imagining it
[164:30.34]Wow.
[164:31.52]I was going through on the webcam mic for your stream.
[164:34.98]Yep, okay.
[164:35.62]Holy shit.
[164:37.46]That's fucking funny.
[164:39.14]Just the whole time we've been playing, I was like, wow, he sounds really muffled, but I just... I didn't want to make it another technical issue.
[164:46.69]But here we are.
[164:47.37]Well, it's because I... Alright, here's why it happened.
[164:49.45]Because I had like three webcams plugged in for the light gun streams.
[164:55.03]And so, by the way, what... Where's the fourth person?
[164:57.15]How is that even plugged in?
[164:57.99]Oh, it's right here.
[164:58.49]Okay.
[164:59.83]Somewhere over there.
[165:01.44]So, I moved my mic.
[165:04.08]So, I unplugged my mic, my actual mic.
[165:07.54]And I didn't plug... When I moved everything, when I plugged everything back in, I guess it just defaulted TeamSpeak to my webcam mic.
[165:15.95]Well, it's all fixed now.
[165:19.09]So, you sound great.
[165:20.05]I probably sound really... In comparison, I probably sound really good.
[165:29.20]It is night and day.
[165:31.20]I heard they really don't want people streaming the beta.
[165:33.64]Well, not according to their official press release.
[165:37.02]That was a thing before now.
[165:38.48]Before now.
[165:39.16]Yeah, they literally announced, like... I believe they undid it yesterday, actually.
[165:43.12]They said, NDA is gone, please stream it, and please talk about it.
[165:46.97]Is what they officially have stated.
[165:50.29]Unless, like, somebody got hacked.
[165:52.51]Which I don't think they did.
[165:55.39]Team speak in 2018.
[165:56.01]Yeah.
[166:02.81]Don't you... Don't at me, Discord.
[166:04.83]We like... What's going on?
[166:08.72]Are we missing the sprite?
[166:09.82]This guy's tried to join like two or three times.
[166:13.22]Okay.
[166:14.54]Might have to cancel it.
[166:16.08]Unfortunately.
[166:22.24]Alright.
[166:22.74]Let's try it again.
[166:26.22]Somebody else.
[166:26.96]If he tries to join again... Okay.
[166:29.32]It's a different person.
[166:30.60]We got another guy.
[166:32.42]War Beast, eh?
[166:33.34]War Beast.
[166:42.90]Apparently, um... We seem to be having problems with the fourth person.
[166:47.12]No, no, they're here.
[166:49.74]Alright.
[166:50.08]10% discount on Steam.
[166:53.75]If you do Humble Bundle monthly.
[166:56.87]Not another subscription.
[167:00.42]Do you actually do anything in the game?
[167:02.12]I mean... It's... Yeah, I mean, you kind of... Is that a real question or a joke question?
[167:09.59]I don't know.
[167:10.57]Not sure.
[167:11.63]It's one of those games where it gets really hard.
[167:15.25]Lots of loot to collect.
[167:18.03]Lots of characters with three classes.
[167:20.49]But there's 15 total classes, right?
[167:23.67]There's five careers and 15 heroes, technically.
[167:28.32]But, I mean, like, technically there's 15, like, sub-classes.
[167:32.37]Right?
[167:32.65]Right.
[167:33.51]Like, you can get unique loot for 15 different sub-classes.
[167:39.13]Yeah.
[167:39.57]That you can't use with the other ones.
[167:41.33]Okay, cool.
[167:42.43]I can't believe I've been a webcam the whole time when you're streaming.
[167:44.63]That's so fucking funny to me.
[167:47.61]I kind of just got used to it.
[167:49.37]Like, I just adapted to it.
[167:51.35]See, like, for instance, look at this guy.
[167:53.22]This dude has a laser beam, a fire laser beam coming out of his hand.
[167:55.96]He's using the fire laser.
[167:57.54]That's cool.
[168:00.48]Like, I upgraded to Sword and Shield Dwarf.
[168:03.74]Yeah, don't... If you're wondering, oh, they're playing the same three levels.
[168:07.90]These are the only three that are available in the beta.
[168:10.82]There's going to be a lot more video game here in a couple weeks.
[168:14.30]We're just testing it.
[168:15.90]If you get to a certain character level as well, you can play them on the... This is the easy mode, technically.
[168:21.65]Yeah, we need to level up our characters to a point where we're allowed to play the hard mode.
[168:34.62]Oh, that's cool.
[168:40.69]No zooming in on this one either.
[168:42.97]So it is poison.
[168:44.27]Or something.
[168:44.69]It's some kind of dot.
[168:47.53]Don't really want to waste it.
[168:57.00]I probably shouldn't be back here.
[168:58.56]I'm just letting that guy hit me.
[169:03.13]Really?
[169:03.39]Like, come on, man.
[169:05.29]Just die.
[169:10.74]Anybody else?
[169:13.90]A machine gun.
[169:16.64]The laser, the fire laser basically is a machine gun.
[169:19.33]That's cool.
[169:22.33]Because it just permanently fires in that direction.
[169:25.96]I think we have a... Oh, boy, that was sick.
[169:30.11]Too bad he's not dead.
[169:31.45]That was really good.
[169:32.33]That was really cool, and I'm really proud of that, but it didn't kill him.
[169:34.99]Every time, I fucking swear to God, they want to get me.
[169:36.99]Every time.
[169:37.39]They only get the streamer, right?
[169:41.15]There's a joke there.
[169:42.55]I don't think we should say it.
[169:44.61]What?
[169:44.93]Only get the streamer?
[169:45.95]It's a personal joke.
[169:47.29]Why is it a personal joke?
[169:48.89]It's a personal joke.
[169:50.79]Think about it.
[169:51.33]Think about who says, he only gets me.
[169:53.76]He only targets me.
[169:58.44]I don't know.
[169:59.94]Oh, come on.
[170:00.84]He only targets me, and that's a good thing?
[170:02.86]That's like an MLC.
[170:07.97]Oh, you could be describing a bunch of different people.
[170:11.99]That was like Smite era.
[170:13.51]Oh.
[170:14.97]You don't remember that?
[170:16.05]Yeah, I guess I do, now that you mention it.
[170:17.35]He only targets me, only goes for me.
[170:24.35]Love you, MLC.
[170:26.19]He's watching right now and he's just like, what the fuck did he say?
[170:28.47]Buy the game.
[170:29.13]I hope he is.
[170:29.83]Buy this game so we can play it.
[170:31.35]I'm going to go activate the spinner.
[170:44.64]I don't really like this dust weapon.
[170:47.86]Dust weapon?
[170:48.76]It just puts dust all over them for a second.
[170:51.20]Okay.
[170:54.77]Somebody's dead?
[170:55.85]That guy's way back there.
[170:57.54]I would love to help, but he's behind cover.
[171:03.82]We got a Bible troll.
[171:06.96]What?
[171:08.10]We're currently fighting the Bible troll.
[171:10.20]I got a Bible troll coming after me.
[171:14.53]Oh, God.
[171:19.69]Don't get away from me.
[171:23.01]Rapid fire is not a good idea.
[171:24.13]Oh, my God.
[171:34.26]I cannot get out of this circle.
[171:36.60]He's a lot of health, it seems.
[171:40.80]There are so many.
[171:47.46]Cut them!
[171:53.10]The bile troll.
[171:54.68]Oh god, there's another one of these stupid things.
[171:56.28]It's one of these dumb guys.
[171:57.32]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[172:06.08]Oh, well.
[172:06.84]It happened.
[172:07.72]Uh, this guy's down in Bile, unfortunately.
[172:17.75]Oh, fuck!
[172:18.73]Oh, no.
[172:19.07]I'm in the tornado.
[172:20.55]This is going south real fast.
[172:22.49]It really is.
[172:22.91]We're gonna need to upgrade our crew.
[172:27.05]I got an itchy hand.
[172:28.89]Why is my left hand itchy?
[172:31.04]I'm down, too.
[172:32.54]This Bile troll was really just... Oh, now I'm pulled.
[172:37.45]Oh, am I dead?
[172:38.97]I think we lose.
[172:39.47]Uh-oh.
[172:41.89]Oh, we just got absolutely decimated.
[172:43.35]Nice scatter arrow.
[172:47.51]I thought you were saying Bible troll the whole time.
[172:49.53]I was.
[172:50.57]Oh.
[172:53.37]No, but now I understand the reference.
[172:56.93]Warbeast has left the game.
[172:59.29]Oh, no.
[172:59.67]We got a rage quit?
[173:01.65]God.
[173:06.32]I didn't like that bow either.
[173:07.34]Alright, did we get enough to get a loot box?
[173:10.58]Hey, do you want to play Farkle on Tabletop Simulator?
[173:17.85]What happened here?
[173:21.03]What happened here?
[173:22.29]What do you mean, what happened here?
[173:23.17]All goose eggs on this guy.
[173:24.93]What's going on here?
[173:26.57]All the goose eggs?
[173:27.83]Yeah, all goose eggs on the Flamecaster.
[173:29.91]What's that about?
[173:30.83]Because he, like, left before the stat screen came up.
[173:38.06]I was told to ask you if you want to play me in Farkle.
[173:41.83]Farkle?
[173:44.41]What is Farkle?
[173:46.63]You'll see.
[173:46.95]What do you mean, you'll see?
[173:49.65]You'll find out.
[173:52.46]That sounds like a gag gift you get at Spencer's.
[173:55.76]Look, you're going to find out, okay?
[173:59.06]You just mentioned, like... Like a gag novelty shop.
[174:09.75]Listen, you'll understand soon enough.
[174:15.75]You do not know what the word that I'm saying is.
[174:17.60]No, I have no idea.
[174:19.30]Okay.
[174:20.20]Well, don't look it up.
[174:22.76]I won't.
[174:24.19]It sounds like you're looking it up right now.
[174:30.08]No, I did I did I didn't I have no idea what it is I heard you you did every time and I'm just yes number of letters that were in the word sparkle actually, but did I Know that why would you even know that he just tried to lie directly to my I did I tried to lie to your face How did you know?
[174:48.65]How did you see through my bullshit?
[174:50.01]I?
[174:51.01]Because we've been friends for like six years, like seven years.
[174:54.61]I know when you're lying to me.
[174:56.87]I typed in the word Farkle.
[174:59.25]I pressed enter and then I heard, yeah, don't do that.
[175:02.85]And I said, okay, I hate the X. Okay, yeah, I'm not doing it as you're doing it like 30 seconds ago.
[175:09.77]So do we have to?
[175:11.41]No, it's not really.
[175:12.47]It doesn't matter if you look it up.
[175:13.55]How do we play this?
[175:16.41]We're not actually gonna do it.
[175:17.23]What do you mean we're not actually gonna do it?
[175:18.67]You just said we are.
[175:19.31]I can't tell you.
[175:20.67]I can't tell you.
[175:22.38]Until it's all... You'll know.
[175:24.46]Hold on a second.
[175:25.30]Is this like a joke where you Farkle in my face?
[175:28.24]No.
[175:29.60]No.
[175:30.00]You're not gonna Farkle in my face?
[175:31.24]Alright, fine.
[175:34.06]You will actually unwittingly play the game Farkle within the next two weeks.
[175:38.07]What?
[175:39.39]How can I unwillingly play something?
[175:41.55]Unwittingly.
[175:44.01]You willingly do it, but you won't know that you're doing it until you're doing it.
[175:48.32]You'll just wait.
[175:48.90]Just wait.
[175:49.42]Listen, less than two weeks, I'll bring it up again.
[175:51.44]Hold on.
[175:51.80]You're telling me that I can't, like, Google what Farkle is for two weeks?
[175:56.00]That's true.
[175:56.46]That's not going to happen.
[175:58.06]Okay, well, then Google it.
[175:59.66]It's a game.
[176:00.74]It's just like a dumb push-your-luck game.
[176:04.17]And we have to play this.
[176:05.75]We can't do this, like, right now.
[176:07.47]No, we don't have to.
[176:08.43]You're going to play it by yourself.
[176:09.71]I'm going to play this by myself.
[176:11.19]Now I have to do it by myself.
[176:13.73]it's just gonna happen alright mute uh take out your earphones for a second I'll tell the other chat so they can spoil it for you no no no I don't want anybody no no no that's not how this works I think we need to put a new mission up there right oh yeah we suck so much we lost well we were the last two alive so
[176:38.33]I don't... Okay, let's take the blame so other random people don't have to.
[176:43.55]Huh?
[176:43.83]No, I... So we can't push it on whoever was playing with us.
[176:46.52]I was not performing to my utmost performance.
[176:48.82]I mean, but we were the last... You were the last one alive.
[176:52.58]So... Last man standing.
[176:58.76]That's me.
[177:03.66]Eat KFC on stream.
[177:07.56]Why?
[177:09.23]Damn it, you just said KFC.
[177:11.37]Ugh.
[177:11.93]Do you love KFC?
[177:13.25]No, I don't even like KFC, but I want it now because that's one person said that.
[177:17.21]Now I want it.
[177:19.02]I want one of the famous bowls with the crispy chicken and the rice.
[177:23.76]God damn it.
[177:24.56]I don't even know if there's a KFC even within 100 miles.
[177:26.86]Do you want one of the ones where it's like the sandwich is made of chicken?
[177:30.79]No, that's overboard.
[177:32.27]That's too much for me.
[177:34.21]Ugh.
[177:35.90]What about like a bucket of drumsticks?
[177:37.38]A bucket of original recipe crispy.
[177:39.06]Extra crispy.
[177:44.55]What about a KFC that's also a Taco Bell?
[177:47.09]No, I don't like the double.
[177:48.25]I don't like that.
[177:48.65]I don't like the dual toothpaste bullshit.
[177:50.29]You know what I mean?
[177:51.67]I don't like that.
[177:52.73]You squeeze it out.
[177:53.57]It's got like two different toothpastes.
[177:55.53]Get that out of here.
[177:56.17]I want one toothpaste because it specializes in to be the one toothpaste that you want.
[178:00.91]When you have two, two different gels going together, they're mismanaged.
[178:10.42]I don't trust it.
[178:11.65]But what about mixing Coke with Sprite, though?
[178:14.73]No, that's gross.
[178:15.37]Don't do that.
[178:15.79]Someone just said, I am at the Taco Bell.
[178:16.95]What do you mean, the Taco Bell?
[178:33.30]You're making that sound like there's one.
[178:34.68]Wow, you're talking about Taco Bell?
[178:36.78]I'm there right now.
[178:37.92]It's not like there's 4,000 restaurants.
[178:39.78]Imagine if there was one Taco Bell.
[178:43.88]How many people would go to that, you think?
[178:46.41]If there was only one Taco Bell in the world.
[178:51.19]That place would get a lot of... Line out the door, I would say.
[178:53.85]They made a huge mistake.
[178:55.69]They should have only had one.
[178:59.75]I am the Taco Bell.
[179:09.15]They probably had enough to open another store, yeah.
[179:12.57]You know, a great point was raised.
[179:14.13]We have been talking about food a lot.
[179:16.10]Because I'm hungry.
[179:17.60]I mean, I am too.
[179:21.96]Alright, we're going to try and we're going to win.
[179:23.74]We're going to get a good new box.
[179:25.40]I want to get up to 20%.
[179:26.39]I want a good new box.
[179:27.99]20% more levels.
[179:28.81]20% more levels?
[179:30.85]Yes.
[179:33.78]Eat some food.
[179:35.06]This always happens, man.
[179:36.12]Every time I... You sound like somebody who, like, doesn't play video games.
[179:39.06]Like, you know, like the law... Forgeball, go blue team.
[179:43.82]That's what that sounds like.
[179:44.66]Yeah.
[179:45.90]I want, like, a loot box that gives me, like, a bunch of levels and... Levels in the box.
[179:50.58]I heard loot boxes were bad.
[179:58.08]Loot boxes.
[180:00.00]Someone on Reddit said loot boxes were bad.
[180:02.04]Don't open this can of worms right now.
[180:03.54]You know you don't want to do that.
[180:04.95]I'm boycotting this game.
[180:06.61]You can't buy loot boxes in it just because it has a box with loot in it.
[180:12.01]You're not even opening a can of worms.
[180:13.19]You're opening that joke Spencer Gifts can of snakes.
[180:16.33]Those people already clicked off the stream like an hour ago.
[180:23.32]You know I'm right.
[180:24.30]Did they?
[180:24.70]I mean, maybe.
[180:25.70]The people I am making fun of right now were here and now they're not.
[180:30.09]As soon as they saw you open the loot box, it inflamed them such that they closed the stream immediately.
[180:39.05]Yeah, but what if they come back and watch the VOD and they hear this?
[180:42.94]They're not going to be happy with you.
[180:44.32]That's okay.
[180:50.64]That's okay.
[180:53.52]Oh, medic.
[180:56.33]Pouches.
[180:59.97]Double kill.
[181:01.23]Did you?
[181:01.65]Alright.
[181:01.99]It all went to shit here last time.
[181:03.73]Let's please let that happen again.
[181:05.87]So how about we don't pull the lever until we clear... Yeah, let's make it so that everything's safe.
[181:12.08]The zombies that are here.
[181:13.70]They're not zombies.
[181:15.14]That guy just dodged like three of those somehow.
[181:21.38]Anymore?
[181:21.70]Yeah, there's a guy over there.
[181:22.52]Watch it.
[181:23.24]Nice, you got him.
[181:24.96]There's some weird ragdoll going on on this side.
[181:27.00]Okay, before we get a special infected to come collapse on us, let's turn it on.
[181:35.37]One thing I am extraordinarily disappointed with in this game... Uh-oh.
[181:39.57]They've removed the... one of my favorite parts of the last game.
[181:44.66]Which was?
[181:45.54]When a horde of rats was coming, they sang that song.
[181:48.40]You know what I'm talking about?
[181:50.14]That, it was like, rat, rat, rat, rat, rat, rat, and then they started running out.
[181:56.21]It was awesome.
[181:58.91]They sang the rats song, and they don't do it anymore.
[182:03.25]Maybe they'll mod that back in.
[182:04.43]Oh, fuck, we got two people in trouble.
[182:06.19]If enough people ask them to bring it back, maybe they'll bring it back as an optional.
[182:11.96]Take out the
[182:19.29]Oh, God.
[182:20.05]Oh, God.
[182:27.01]Wait, I stole that song?
[182:28.69]No, I... What are you talking about?
[182:29.87]I made that rat song before Vermintide 1 even came out.
[182:34.66]Come on, man.
[182:34.96]What do you think?
[182:35.34]What do you think I am?
[182:36.08]Some kind of thief?
[182:37.22]When did Vermintide 1 come out?
[182:40.40]2016?
[182:40.42]2015?
[182:40.60]Then we're in, like, the last couple... It was, like, two years ago.
[182:53.15]Rat thief.
[182:55.67]No, they copied him.
[182:58.71]Don't even... No, don't say that shit.
[183:00.13]They got the inspiration for the rat song.
[183:05.05]Rats were in fucking Warhammer for like 200 years.
[183:09.64]200?
[183:11.58]Like 100 years ago when Mr. Warhammer made Warhammer.
[183:15.30]When J.R.R.
[183:16.68]Tolkien invented the Warhammer universe.
[183:18.82]Yes.
[183:21.04]Rats were in it.
[183:22.69]You guys are acting like I invented rats.
[183:25.94]I didn't.
[183:26.98]Willard was a movie.
[183:34.98]No, that's me implying that Willard invented rats.
[183:38.14]No, that's not the implication here.
[183:41.61]We're waiting for you guys.
[183:43.57]Oh, that's my bad.
[183:45.99]I'm being checked on right now.
[183:54.23]Here they come.
[183:57.23]Is that the rat horn?
[183:58.39]It would be like... Maybe if we ask nicely, they'll put the song back in, you know?
[184:05.83]And you would hear a bunch of rats being like... It was like an old football chant that they would do.
[184:11.80]It was awesome.
[184:12.72]And it's gone.
[184:13.70]Gone, I tell you.
[184:14.60]Gone.
[184:18.46]Gone, I tell you.
[184:23.86]Oh, I'm in the corner.
[184:27.71]You're stuck?
[184:28.15]Are you good?
[184:29.19]I'm good.
[184:30.15]I have a teammate.
[184:31.79]Good.
[184:32.63]I'm very glad.
[184:35.07]I have a real teammate.
[184:37.15]Who sticks with me.
[184:39.96]Yeah.
[184:40.68]Do you?
[184:42.68]I'm very happy for you guys.
[184:49.76]Listen to that D2 clicking skill.
[184:54.68]I've been doing this shit for a long time.
[184:56.75]Hold the button down.
[184:57.45]That makes a charge swing.
[185:06.13]Feels good to be back in D2.
[185:07.25]This just is Diablo II.
[185:10.49]No, just do this for like 16 hours straight.
[185:13.27]No wonder I have problems with my hands.
[185:14.86]No, we're definitely gonna have carpal tunnel when we're older.
[185:21.74]That's a guarantee.
[185:23.95]maybe listen listen did you hear that that's that's not it that's the centurion but that's not it that's they did that too I missed the old chance
[185:48.18]This is Diablo 3 to Vermintide 1's Diablo II.
[185:52.60]Wait, what?
[185:53.68]It's already begun.
[185:54.52]It's already begun.
[186:00.53]It was so much better when they did it before.
[186:03.93]Oh, I see what you're doing here.
[186:07.71]God, I want KFC now.
[186:11.91]You want to know how McDonald's and all these other places can make a quarter of a billion dollars a day?
[186:17.89]There's one of those hunters behind you.
[186:20.27]Is that your one sauce?
[186:21.86]No, don't.
[186:25.16]Imagine if Taco Bell delivered...
[186:29.08]I am going to try the stupid meme sauce.
[186:32.43]I don't care.
[186:33.55]Judge me all you want.
[186:34.87]But if I go to McDonald's again, I'm going to try the stupid meme sauce.
[186:39.37]You've already had it.
[186:40.29]You've already eaten it.
[186:40.83]There's my confession.
[186:42.99]You've never had it.
[186:43.65]You've never eaten that sauce before.
[186:44.85]It was just called something else.
[186:47.18]No, I'm sure it is just the same recipe, but like a different name.
[186:49.84]It doesn't matter.
[186:50.42]Guess what?
[186:50.70]They turn the vat over and dump it into another container and call it something else.
[186:55.46]Yeah, that's what they do for those little suckers you get at the doctor when they make the mystery flavor.
[187:02.39]The dum-dums.
[187:03.21]That's how they make the dum-dum mystery flavor.
[187:04.73]They just turn the fat over, whatever flavors they have.
[187:07.29]There it goes.
[187:08.97]Would you order delivery if you could order from McDonald's?
[187:12.48]Would I order McDonald's delivery?
[187:14.88]Yes, would you?
[187:16.38]If it was like an Uber situation where you didn't have to tip them.
[187:20.41]Then yes.
[187:21.05]Hold on.
[187:21.29]I got the funny thing funny thing going on here.
[187:23.06]Come on.
[187:23.64]I'm not saying I wouldn't tip I'm saying the expectation Hold on.
[187:28.50]You're saying you don't want to tip anybody.
[187:30.64]No, like okay.
[187:31.24]Listen I like I like shaking ride sharing because they don't they don't expect you to tip you can and that's fine and I do But I don't like it when it's expected because it's supposed to be like a gift that you get It shouldn't be like the expectation a gift
[187:47.32]It's like yeah, America is the only country in the world.
[187:51.04]No tell me how you really feel service providers How Europeans tell them?
[187:59.38]Yeah, blame the blame the people whoever's at the very beginning of time in America the first guy that was like, you know I'm just gonna pay my employees four dollars an hour like you blame that guy.
[188:11.11]Oh
[188:12.81]They'll just get tips.
[188:13.71]It'll be fine.
[188:14.55]I'm going to pay my employees like three bucks an hour.
[188:18.02]Like, that's the guy you should be angry at.
[188:24.65]In any European country, you go sit down and eat, you don't tip people.
[188:28.65]You just don't.
[188:30.19]Unless you want to, because you're a very generous person.
[188:32.69]You don't feel bad not doing it because you think, wow, that person who served me food isn't going to be able to feed their child tonight because of how little they're being paid.
[188:40.43]Yeah, but that happens over here.
[188:43.73]That's what I'm saying.
[188:44.37]Yeah, so tip the guy upside down with the coins in his pocket.
[188:47.83]That's like, no, my employees don't deserve more than $4 an hour.
[188:51.76]Yeah, no, it's definitely their fault.
[188:53.12]But that's what I'm, that's what I like about, you know, ride sharing.
[188:56.16]And that's what I would like about going back to the subway and delivering food sharing.
[189:00.53]Yeah, you just fucking sit at the same table.
[189:01.83]If there wasn't an expectation, because otherwise I would just drive myself to McDonald's to not have to tip.
[189:08.61]Do you see what I'm saying?
[189:09.35]Yeah.
[189:09.53]Alright.
[189:09.93]But I think we're just coming up with a great idea here.
[189:11.89]Like a food sharing app.
[189:14.98]right yeah where you oh you you you queue up with somebody and you're like alright we're gonna go to we're gonna go to this restaurant yeah matchmake you matchmake on somebody and you you you're all because food is expensive you know what I mean so you're gonna go to the same restaurant and order the same dish and all eat off the same plate together food sharing that's a great idea
[189:36.94]So you could go to, like, the nicest restaurant in Boston and order, like, order, like, a filet mignon, like, a $50 steak, $60 steak for, like, and split it between three people.
[189:45.83]This is important.
[189:46.53]I need to be revived.
[189:47.51]Oh, do you?
[189:48.89]I'll get you.
[189:51.39]Yeah.
[189:54.33]Thank you.
[189:55.25]That's not a terrible idea.
[189:56.19]Imagine being able to go to, like, one of the nicest restaurants in the city.
[189:59.03]Does someone have to pick you up?
[190:01.13]Who drives?
[190:03.05]That's you figure that out.
[190:04.63]Maybe the person like is that right sharing plus food sharing or I mean you could take an uber you could take an uber take an uber ride share and have queued up in your food share and
[190:17.12]already queued up so you know it's two in the same thing I got this idea instead right for food sharing food sharing you decide the people you want to do the food sharing with then when you order it they come in like a food van to a general area right and like the food is like served as if it was a mini restaurant
[190:35.47]No, but then that's just somebody just delivered food to you.
[190:38.44]No, that's just a food delivery.
[190:40.38]I'm talking about going into the restaurant.
[190:41.92]Oh, you're talking about being in the restaurant.
[190:44.10]Yeah, you go into the restaurant and like five people.
[190:46.38]Chili's like three for 20, you know?
[190:50.72]No, but you go in there with like 12 people.
[190:53.00]You go like, hey guys, you all want a little piece of this?
[190:55.78]We get a little mini dessert.
[190:57.02]We get like a mini appetizer.
[190:59.02]It's like two for 20.
[191:02.37]No, but okay, so if you, okay, I'm gonna give you a scenario.
[191:06.60]Going into Boston, being in downtown, and going to one of the nicest Italian restaurants in here.
[191:12.13]A piece of seared salmon with asparagus made by one of the most accomplished chefs in the city.
[191:17.99]I mean, it might be like $50 to $70 a plate, right?
[191:21.64]Imagine you went in there.
[191:22.50]I mean, that's way out of budget for everybody, right?
[191:24.86]Like, who the fuck's gonna do that?
[191:26.26]I mean, I do it like once or twice a week, but... I mean, who's got the fucking money to do that, you know what I'm saying?
[191:31.26]So you go in there with like 15 people.
[191:34.17]And everybody gets to share.
[191:36.89]You all order it.
[191:37.65]Everybody gets one bite.
[191:39.75]Some people have to share one bite.
[191:41.97]And you can like take an Instagram.
[191:43.51]No, but you can take like an Instagram picture.
[191:45.05]Like, oh, here I am at this restaurant.
[191:46.81]Hashtag restaurant.
[191:48.52]And everybody on your feed will be like, whoa, holy shit.
[191:54.78]So you want basically like the people in Sam's Club who hand out like little toothpicks of food.
[192:04.21]We don't need this.
[192:04.87]Oh!
[192:04.93]Got it.
[192:10.44]No, I don't eat at those restaurants.
[192:12.68]You kidding me?
[192:13.26]I would go broke.
[192:13.70]So you went to, like, a really expensive high-class restaurant to just have the toothpick lady who walks around asking for samplers.
[192:20.33]No, but, like, you would be queued up and you'd matchmake.
[192:24.95]You could all go in there and it could match you up based on what you wanted to eat and share.
[192:29.89]So let's say you just wanted a dessert, you know?
[192:31.69]You could get, like, 40 people to all queue up and go to the same restaurant, get one of the giant party tables, and eat one creme brulee.
[192:41.11]And some of the people are only there just for fun.
[192:42.55]Like, I would just go for fun.
[192:44.17]Right?
[192:44.41]I would be like, oh, it's okay.
[192:45.25]You can, like, breathe in my face and I'll just, like, smell it.
[192:47.27]Like, I don't even need to eat it.
[192:48.69]That'd be fun to go to.
[192:54.78]Etalyx probably doesn't even tip his toothpick lady because he's a monster.
[192:59.38]His toothpick lady.
[193:03.94]That's called being a cheap asshole.
[193:05.84]Listen, I actually tip very well.
[193:08.52]But...
[193:09.82]I don't want to be in someone's car who expects me to give them money.
[193:14.78]That's why I stopped taking taxis.
[193:16.76]Was this guy double-pulled?
[193:18.49]I think he was double-pulled.
[193:20.47]Yeah, but you still tip on, like, lift.
[193:22.49]Yeah, but you don't go in taxis for the same reason, right?
[193:25.75]Because you can leave the taxi without being harassed for tipping.
[193:30.78]I mean, but taxis are just extremely expensive.
[193:33.18]That's why it sucks taking them.
[193:35.47]I have gotten into taxis before.
[193:37.25]That was a nice grenade.
[193:37.97]Who asked me how I was intending to pay before we had even left.
[193:42.60]I don't need that in my life, you know?
[193:45.14]Yeah, but okay, let's go over this.
[193:48.56]A taxi, taking a yellow cab, just like, hey, taxi, like whistle, is like 60% more expensive than taking a Lyft or an Uber.
[193:57.74]Yeah.
[193:58.48]And they want a tip too.
[193:59.70]But I'm alright with tip.
[194:00.82]I'm okay with tipping a shitload when I do like a Lyft or an Uber because like I know I'm getting a discount already.
[194:05.22]I already got the sale price.
[194:06.20]You're getting a discount and you're getting a much more pleasant experience.
[194:10.46]I don't know about pleasant.
[194:13.89]My experiences have been very pleasant.
[194:15.59]We've had plenty of drivers that have been... There's a couple of large exceptions to that.
[194:23.89]Anyway.
[194:25.63]I've had a taxi guy try to keep my bag.
[194:28.95]What?
[194:30.50]He wouldn't give me my bag back.
[194:33.77]alright I've never heard this story that's the story that's the story the story is like I wanted to go two miles down the road and he thought that was too short of a distance he wanted me to go further so I could pay him more so instead of just take me the two miles to my destination he didn't want to give me my bag back until I agreed to pay a premium of forty dollars no matter how far we went I would have to pay forty dollars
[195:03.11]So I said no, and then he went into my bag.
[195:06.87]I said no.
[195:08.11]I'm not going to pay you a flat rate to take me two miles down the road.
[195:11.71]Sorry.
[195:12.11]The way you said that, though, I said no.
[195:14.51]I said no.
[195:18.17]I didn't hit anybody.
[195:19.91]How?
[195:28.62]Oh, big guy.
[195:34.93]Well, he blew up a flashbang next to me.
[195:37.63]My ears are in trouble.
[195:39.61]I'm being pulled behind us.
[195:44.49]That person was just kind of just standing there.
[195:46.13]Right in the skull, come on.
[195:53.34]I'm gonna take another one of these pots.
[195:58.38]And... no, they're not moving.
[196:08.48]What is brave on Metacritic right now?
[196:10.32]Somebody look it up.
[196:12.72]Is brave as critically acclaimed?
[196:16.22]I'm serious.
[196:16.84]Is brave a critically acclaimed enough movie to make a parody character in your video game?
[196:22.31]It's got to be like a 71, right?
[196:24.97]You think it's you?
[196:27.59]I'm the brave character.
[196:28.59]I'm like the Scottish girl with the brave accent with the bow and arrow.
[196:32.43]I mean, there'll be a skin.
[196:37.13]What is it at?
[196:37.45]What's it at right now?
[196:39.89]It's at 69.
[196:41.29]It's actually 69.
[196:41.79]See?
[196:42.77]Right?
[196:50.36]What's the point?
[196:51.84]The point is that I'm playing a character right now that is based off of that character in that movie that is a 69%.
[196:56.92]Like, was that movie that well-received and critically acclaimed where you'd make a reference to it?
[197:08.78]Uh, well, I don't want to say what I want to say, because I think I've said enough controversial things for one night, so.
[197:15.68]Oh, controversy.
[197:21.53]It's just a Scottish accent and a bow.
[197:24.33]That's it.
[197:24.79]That's it.
[197:25.13]That's it.
[197:25.77]That's where the similarities stop.
[197:28.09]Well, that is true.
[197:30.17]You have a bow and an accent.
[197:33.49]You just don't like Scottish people.
[197:35.27]No, here comes, like, Luther, though.
[197:36.49]Not Luther.
[197:37.09]Uther.
[197:39.26]Uther is going to come out of that statue and save us.
[197:49.72]Just say it.
[197:51.02]I was just going to say that everyone makes the brave character because unfortunately there's really not that many female hero characters to imitate.
[198:02.16]Elsa, you're worth a fuck, dude.
[198:07.85]But like,
[198:09.45]But, you know, that's true.
[198:11.81]You do have a point.
[198:19.47]Why am I dying so much?
[198:21.29]Are you?
[198:22.55]I am, yeah.
[198:23.21]I'm about to be dead dead.
[198:25.79]Elsa.
[198:26.46]Like, that's the end all be all.
[198:29.06]But hold on a minute.
[198:29.76]But to be fair.
[198:31.08]To be fair.
[198:33.98]Elsa is important enough to redo the Disney Magic Kingdom castle for her.
[198:39.04]And it was Cinderella before.
[198:40.32]But, I mean, I would love a castle.
[198:42.62]Did you say I would love a castle?
[198:45.09]I would love a castle.
[198:47.45]So, Elsa is a pretty recent, very important female lead character in Disney lore.
[198:53.81]Could use a lot more of them.
[198:56.85]I agree.
[198:58.62]It's a pretty male-dominated world, especially in the realm of cartoon characters.
[199:03.78]Yeah.
[199:08.02]It's a real like this were like touchy subject this is real like real life though cartoon characters What do you want cartoon like lady heroes?
[199:19.83]Like fake ones not real as we can't stand real ones Mining Okay, we got a machine gunner
[199:38.63]Where are they coming out from?
[199:39.57]Where is he?
[199:40.33]He's coming through all the gates.
[199:41.37]That person just launched so far.
[199:47.48]Hold on, I'm coming.
[199:52.78]No, don't spin over here.
[199:53.86]What about Spider-Man?
[200:04.35]Yeah, what about Spider-Man?
[200:05.73]What about Spider-Man?
[200:07.12]We're looking for, like, more... I'm down again.
[200:08.72]We're looking for more good, like, female lead characters.
[200:11.18]Like, how about Spider-Man?
[200:12.96]How about Spider-Man?
[200:14.60]What about Spider-Gwen, you know?
[200:17.16]Spider-Man.
[200:19.27]Dude, they could really pull, like, a fucking real Samus Aran, you know what I mean?
[200:22.47]And, like, Peter Parker takes his helmet off, takes his mask off, and it's just a girl under there.
[200:27.85]Wait, rephrase that.
[200:29.23]It's just a girl under there.
[200:30.43]No, it's not just a girl.
[200:32.75]It's a strong, independent, doesn't take nothing from nobody woman.
[200:40.26]No, it's Spider-Man woman.
[200:46.60]Don't jump down the stairs.
[200:47.66]Peter Parker takes his mask.
[200:48.86]I'm not going to jump down the stairs.
[200:50.44]Yes, he is.
[200:51.20]Watch this.
[200:56.69]Yeah, Etalyx, you're really opening all these cans of worms tonight.
[200:59.89]I am, yeah.
[201:01.83]But I was told to say it anyway.
[201:03.95]How do I deflate?
[201:07.47]I'm going to let them pick you up before I come down there.
[201:15.10]Isn't it the Scarlet Spider, though?
[201:16.54]Scarlet Spider is a thing.
[201:17.92]There's a lot of Spider-Man universe women characters.
[201:21.44]It's just the fact that none of us can name any of them is the issue.
[201:27.97]What about, um... As long as the character is written very well, it's not poorly written, they're a good character.
[201:40.55]How about Lady Thor?
[201:41.41]They actually did that.
[201:42.63]They did Lady Thor.
[201:43.87]That's pretty cool.
[201:45.93]That was pretty cool.
[201:50.53]They made Thor into a woman.
[201:55.78]Oh, God.
[201:57.68]I suck at this game, apparently.
[202:01.36]Oh, boy.
[202:02.46]I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
[202:11.02]Oh, boy.
[202:13.06]No, you had... Oh, boy.
[202:15.84]No, you had... Wait a second.
[202:18.14]What'd you have?
[202:19.36]I had a couple of green chalk circles on my chalkboard.
[202:23.09]You got 52 range kills.
[202:25.52]okay but you're the ranged character so I almost got as many ranged kills as you maybe dwarfs everyone did tell me dwarf sucks when I picked it but the shield's pretty good this game's fun I'm having I'm having a fun time in this game so far I just wish we could do the other difficulty maybe we will very soon be able to soon
[202:51.35]Additionally, if you keep leveling up, you're level four.
[202:54.61]So maybe one more round and you can actually play with the next class in your... Oh, that's true.
[202:59.37]Charming a trinket.
[203:00.57]Cool.
[203:02.01]I only got one chest.
[203:03.71]Well, that's going to bring me up.
[203:04.86]You only got one chest?
[203:05.68]What do you mean?
[203:08.20]I only got one chest.
[203:10.88]The game is punishing you.
[203:12.84]You're being punished.
[203:14.70]Where's my catch-up mechanic?
[203:18.02]Where's your Luigi?
[203:18.68]It's like in the racing games where you last place and you go faster.
[203:22.47]No, do not bring that in here.
[203:25.05]Do not bring in the Luigi blue shell mechanic.
[203:33.69]Matt, what am I at now?
[203:35.07]68, 70.
[203:35.66]That's still a long way to go.
[203:37.02]I don't even know what I get.
[203:40.56]When do you unlock your hero, the new class?
[203:43.24]Level 5, isn't it?
[203:44.80]Or is it level 7?
[203:46.10]It looks like it's level 5.
[203:48.51]You get a talent at level 5 too.
[203:51.25]Maybe this is just... I do want to play at least long enough to see this.
[203:58.43]Another Mario reference.
[203:59.60]Can I buy more loot boxes?
[204:00.88]I want to buy some loot boxes.
[204:02.66]No, don't even give them the idea.
[204:03.82]Alright, let's make a new party.
[204:07.80]Okay.
[204:09.28]Which level have we done the least?
[204:10.74]Probably level 3, but you can't play that one.
[204:12.32]The 3 one, but that's the one that breaks my computer.
[204:14.06]You can't do it.
[204:14.84]I mean, I could try.
[204:19.14]Can you manage?
[204:19.93]Which one did we just do?
[204:20.87]We just did the first one, didn't we?
[204:22.31]Yeah.
[204:24.25]I mean, we've only done the third one one time.
[204:27.71]We've only done the second one one time.
[204:29.45]We only beat the second one one time.
[204:31.38]The second one's the forest one, isn't it?
[204:34.94]Yeah, but we've only done the third one once.
[204:37.58]We've done the second and third one the same number of times.
[204:44.95]because we yeah because we started with the third one and lost immediately then we went back to the first one and lost then we started opening it to the public to the first one and one we've done the first one three times technically we've beaten it only twice we've only beaten the second and third one once alright we'll just get in here we'll we'll do we'll do the we'll do two or three again
[205:09.81]I want to do a not recruit difficulty, but I don't know if we're going to be able to do that.
[205:13.59]It's going to take a long time.
[205:14.66]We're progressing characters that are going to get wiped in like four days.
[205:19.32]We're putting some time in for these to get deleted.
[205:29.78]This is all going to be deleted.
[205:32.02]Actually, you know what I should do?
[205:33.38]I want to try changing my settings real quick.
[205:36.32]And then that's going to require a game restart.
[205:39.71]No, this is unlocked at level 7.
[205:41.55]You're right.
[205:42.05]Damn it.
[205:43.19]Fuck.
[205:45.77]What does this one do?
[205:46.51]Is this like a magician?
[205:48.73]Wait, what do I turn off?
[205:53.97]I guess this is the spear.
[205:54.94]I'll try.
[205:55.34]Sun shadows.
[205:56.34]Am I blind?
[205:58.56]Is it this one?
[206:03.53]I don't know.
[206:05.23]I want to play at least long enough to see the other class, right?
[206:07.91]Oh, there it is.
[206:08.31]That's important.
[206:09.77]I need to know if I want to see it.
[206:12.78]I need to know if I want to see it.
[206:14.06]I want to restart my game real quick.
[206:20.38]You're restarting your game?
[206:22.24]Yeah, to make the visual changes take effect.
[206:25.02]Okay.
[206:30.42]The Handmaiden is really bad.
[206:32.20]Really?
[206:32.62]Have I been playing on this character the entire time?
[206:35.17]The Handmaiden?
[206:35.99]Which one's that?
[206:36.47]The second one?
[206:36.91]That's the second.
[206:37.47]That's the spear.
[206:38.65]The second one was one of the original ones I was most interested in just because I like the spear.
[206:42.62]Somebody said it was bad.
[206:46.43]I think it just has more reach and does a lot more poke damage to the harder enemies.
[206:50.99]Here comes a beta criticism.
[206:53.59]Are you ready?
[206:55.37]He's going to criticize this beta.
[206:57.45]Are you criticizing the game or just this beta?
[206:59.62]The beta.
[207:00.30]I'm not criticizing the game.
[207:01.18]I'm criticizing the beta.
[207:03.24]Okay.
[207:03.78]These should all be available right now.
[207:07.57]Uh, yeah, that's true.
[207:09.42]If it is indeed a test of making sure everything works, then probably all the classes should be unlocked.
[207:14.90]Yeah, I mean, if the purpose is, I mean, not only that, but there's three levels.
[207:20.24]But maybe they're also testing how long it takes you to level up to unlock them.
[207:25.13]Oh, wait, that's true.
[207:26.39]Wait a minute, you're right.
[207:27.61]But still, fuck that.
[207:31.51]Maybe they need to tweak the, you know, XP.
[207:36.33]Maybe this is a tweaking XP test.
[207:43.98]I think the cause of the criticism is that since it is beta and we only have three levels, if we had all 15 to 25 levels, however many there are, then you wouldn't even notice.
[207:55.13]Right.
[207:57.63]They nerfed the XP from last beta.
[207:59.69]Did they really?
[208:01.06]Interesting.
[208:03.15]Um, can I, I want to craft another bow.
[208:04.99]I don't like this bow.
[208:05.69]I'm coming back in.
[208:06.85]Just come on in and just, you know, you just do all the work.
[208:09.09]You know what to do.
[208:12.88]I want a better bow.
[208:15.08]Do I have enough to craft something?
[208:17.40]How do you even get, oh, right here.
[208:24.92]Salvage.
[208:31.38]Alright, give me a new bow.
[208:34.83]This is a swift bow or a long bow.
[208:38.03]Let's go with a long bow.
[208:39.61]God dang it.
[208:44.54]Can't do it.
[208:46.10]Shit.
[208:54.52]Oh, well.
[208:57.28]That's unfortunate.
[208:58.04]Where's the target dummy?
[208:58.84]I don't know.
[209:01.76]Where'd they pick it up from?
[209:05.45]Because I want to see how much damage this windup does.
[209:10.36]Telex, I want to play the game.
[209:11.66]I know, me too.
[209:13.62]But I want to know what this pickaxe is good for.
[209:15.66]And now I'm upset.
[209:16.92]Now I'm going to start breaking things in my room.
[209:19.00]So if you want to play the game, find me the target dummy and bring it down here.
[209:22.93]I don't know where it is.
[209:24.71]You know as much as I do.
[209:30.45]Where is it?
[209:32.06]I'm not in here.
[209:32.94]I don't know where to just just just queue up You know I don't want to I don't want to be stuck using this pickaxe if it sucks It's don't worry don't name out of your characters getting deleted in three days Yeah, but I want to have fun now.
[209:42.98]You know I'm saying just have fun in three days I don't I don't know where he is.
[209:49.21]I have no idea
[209:50.66]Not to mention you could queue it up, you know?
[209:52.58]It's not like it's my lobby.
[209:54.24]Yeah, but you are the one who decided that you were going to be in charge of the creation of the lobby system.
[210:04.41]I believe that was decided for me, but continue.
[210:07.25]Alright, so go to story mode, public game.
[210:09.83]Story mode, public game.
[210:11.95]I'm going to do level two.
[210:13.99]Difficulty, recruit, public, play.
[210:18.17]Here we go, here we go, there it is.
[210:21.92]That actually is the easiest thing you could possibly do.
[210:28.24]That was so easy, I'm embarrassed I was making you do that.
[210:33.68]As you should be.
[210:34.44]Now find the stupid target dummy.
[210:38.16]Wait, you can actually do that?
[210:39.18]What?
[210:39.28]You can jump off the cliff.
[210:46.63]Game doesn't hold your hand.
[210:49.05]No hand holding here.
[210:51.04]Just true FPS action.
[210:54.34]Are you good enough?
[210:55.56]Are you hardcore enough?
[210:57.35]Lawbreakers.
[210:59.85]14 concurrent players.
[211:03.63]I'm sorry.
[211:04.17]Somebody probably likes the Lawbreakers here.
[211:06.51]And wow, I just totally zinged you.
[211:22.42]Uh, I'm sorry.
[211:23.82]Was that uncalled for?
[211:24.88]Somebody else found it.
[211:26.99]He heard you telling me to get it.
[211:30.41]Zero players now.
[211:31.37]Alright, so my full charge pickaxe swing does 3000 damage.
[211:36.11]Is that a lot?
[211:37.89]Uh, sounds like a lot.
[211:40.62]I do 775 on a fully charge.
[211:42.30]Does it matter if you hit him in the head or no?
[211:45.06]Uh, I don't think so.
[211:47.08]LawBreakersDev in the chat.
[211:48.70]No, CliffyB is not in here.
[211:50.30]CliffyB is like working on another game.
[211:53.16]He's currently making like... some other game.
[211:56.24]No, he's not.
[211:56.72]They're still working on LawBreakers, aren't they?
[211:59.92]Are they still making LawBreakers?
[212:01.10]No, no, no.
[212:01.60]Yeah, but CliffyB doesn't have nothing to do with Fortnite.
[212:05.18]CliffyB... Am I saying his name right?
[212:09.28]CliffyB?
[212:17.96]The one and only!
[212:19.55]Is that a guy?
[212:21.47]Is that a saxophone player?
[212:22.89]Is that a guy?
[212:24.21]No, it's definitely Cliffy B. Okay, but does he also play the saxophone?
[212:30.35]Because that's a name I... Like, Cliffy... And over here on the saxophone, we got Cliffy B. And the guy with the saxophone is Moe.
[212:39.68]But I can zoom in.
[212:40.62]A lot.
[212:41.38]Okay.
[212:41.84]Well, I'm stupid.
[212:47.24]But he's in here?
[212:48.56]No he's not, shut up.
[212:55.48]I'm pretty sure pretty much everyone at Epic is working on Fortnite now.
[212:59.68]Cause they stopped Paragon entirely.
[213:04.06]We're missing one person.
[213:06.85]We're bringing the target dummy, the training dummy's coming too.
[213:10.19]What's wrong with my character?
[213:13.87]He's behind you.
[213:15.19]Cliffy B and Kenny G. What if he's just behind me?
[213:17.71]He's right behind you.
[213:18.69]He, like, knocks on my window.
[213:20.41]Hey, man.
[213:21.01]Heard you saying that about Lawbreakers?
[213:24.24]No.
[213:24.30]I'm a huge fan.
[213:41.11]Guys, if you ever want to make sure if somebody like... How you make somebody like you, even if you don't really play their game or watch their TV shows and movies or watch their streams or their YouTube.
[213:51.13]Anytime you see somebody that's like, yeah, I'm a huge fan.
[213:53.79]Dude, holy, what's up?
[213:55.17]I'm a huge fan, man.
[213:56.86]Oh, wow.
[213:57.54]And then they feel like, oh, they're a huge fan.
[213:59.68]And then they'll tell you all their secrets.
[214:02.30]In real life, I'd be a huge fan.
[214:04.68]Why, did you like Gears of War?
[214:06.67]I mean, he's just like, he's just a celebrity, you know?
[214:08.65]Why wouldn't you want to shake the hand, you know?
[214:10.14]They made a lot of waves in the gaming world.
[214:12.40]Yeah.
[214:13.06]I mean, were you a big fan of Gears of War?
[214:15.82]It wasn't just Gears.
[214:17.52]How much of a fan of Gears of War are you?
[214:21.14]I played it a lot.
[214:22.67]What about the CEO of Comcast?
[214:26.93]Didn't he do a lot with Unreal?
[214:28.45]I mean, he is Unreal, you're right.
[214:30.85]He's like, he's very Unreal.
[214:36.36]I don't know.
[214:37.13]I don't know.
[214:37.57]I don't know.
[214:37.91]I don't like browse Cliffy P's LinkedIn profile.
[214:41.83]I don't know what he did.
[214:46.77]I'm sure he's done a lot of great things for the gaming world.
[214:49.60]World.
[214:55.60]Like, if you met Miyamoto, wouldn't you be like, oh, I'm a huge fan?
[214:58.68]Yeah, I mean, I would... Games of War is a great game.
[215:03.07]Like, if you met Randy Pinchford, would you be like, I'm a huge fan?
[215:08.55]Wait, why am I, I'm not mocking Cliff, I just said, I almost said Ricky B. Yeah, Rocky B, Rocky Balboa is like one of my favorites.
[215:30.39]Being sarcastic.
[215:31.35]No, I'm just, I'm obviously just kidding.
[215:33.40]I mean, I did say something really, I did say something really mean about LawBreakers, but like, that's true!
[215:42.98]That part wasn't a joke.
[215:44.10]That part wasn't a joke, but that wasn't a joke.
[215:46.58]I wasn't telling a joke.
[215:52.81]It doesn't mean everything else he's done has been not good.
[215:58.64]Backtracking, here he goes, the backtracking asshole.
[216:01.25]I was just kidding.
[216:05.85]Like, uh, if you got to meet... I'm dropping frames now.
[216:11.45]Alright, ever since I started talking about, like, Cliffy B, my stream is dying.
[216:19.23]He's cursing me.
[216:23.58]Apparently...
[216:25.90]Apparently he turned on the remaining lawbreakers servers to DDoS my stream.
[216:31.98]He's just using them to take your stream.
[216:35.58]Now we're just getting into like mean territory and this is not what I want, okay?
[216:39.32]I gotta, we're gonna, we're gonna- What it is though.
[216:41.74]No, it's not.
[216:42.97]I don't want this.
[216:44.54]Look, if you didn't have an audience right now, don't change who you are, you know what I'm saying?
[216:47.96]But that's just not nice.
[216:49.20]Just because you're being broadcast and recorded and this bridge may be burned in the future for who knows what reason.
[216:54.65]I don't have any bridges.
[216:57.69]All I have is a giant fort and I just sit in it and I just twiddle my fingers together.
[217:09.52]It's too late now.
[217:16.64]Blow the horn.
[217:21.08]He's really sad.
[217:27.28]Wow, that was a lot going on.
[217:34.20]Are we safe to go down here?
[217:35.08]I don't know.
[217:37.44]I think we're safe to go down here.
[217:43.68]Oh, I took his head clean off.
[217:45.18]That was pretty cool.
[218:01.76]Speaking of Unreal, let's be real for a second here, okay?
[218:06.42]Don't do that.
[218:07.68]No, no, no.
[218:09.02]Don't do that.
[218:09.62]I'm going to talk about the Unreal Tournament.
[218:12.74]No puns.
[218:14.54]Oh, that was pretty gross.
[218:17.08]You're right.
[218:19.40]Is the free-to-play Unreal ever going to come out?
[218:23.56]I feel like... I don't want to say they can't.
[218:27.69]Because that was interesting.
[218:28.47]But I feel like they canned it.
[218:29.55]Did they?
[218:29.85]And it was an alpha.
[218:31.09]Is it actually canned?
[218:32.67]I just think, honestly, everything at Epic, once Fortnite happened, I think that they just did the thing where they dropped everything they're doing to make as much money as they can on that.
[218:44.00]Maybe.
[218:44.26]Nope, Fortnite is a huge success.
[218:47.26]Especially the Battle Royale.
[218:50.64]No, that is Fortnite.
[218:52.78]But...
[218:54.05]The Battle Royale is Fortnite.
[218:56.13]You don't say especially the Battle Royale.
[218:58.01]You say Fortnite is very successful.
[219:00.97]By the way, whatever happened to the single player version of Fortnite?
[219:04.01]Still exists.
[219:05.49]You can play it.
[219:07.00]Might not be able to find it.
[219:07.76]I know you can play it.
[219:08.74]It's not a question of capability.
[219:12.70]You can play it?
[219:13.96]You used to play it?
[219:14.56]I'm just saying that probably 93% of everyone who ever bought Fortnite hasn't played it.
[219:20.65]I mean, that might be true.
[219:22.07]It's a H1Z1.
[219:22.85]Storm Fiend.
[219:25.29]It's literally H1Z1 over again.
[219:27.63]Like, no one learned the lesson the first time.
[219:33.58]Watch it.
[219:34.22]Oh, boy.
[219:34.58]Time to throw a... I'm def-grenading myself.
[219:36.18]Who cares?
[219:37.96]I got potions.
[219:42.68]Aye.
[219:47.35]Oh, boy.
[219:47.91]Not like this.
[219:53.82]Right in the head, come on.
[219:56.28]Alright, those guys are gone.
[219:57.06]Right in the head, come on.
[220:03.33]Right in the head.
[220:11.06]Oooh, he's dead.
[220:11.92]Nice work.
[220:12.62]Nice work, everybody.
[220:18.29]Everyone's talking about, Epic is a find a way to ruin a game, they're a shitty studio.
[220:22.74]Well, here's the thing, listen, listen, listen.
[220:26.16]At this stage in the game, in the gaming world, it used to be
[220:31.32]Oh, Valve is the one that's the good gaming company.
[220:34.22]They do no wrong, ever!
[220:36.30]Blizzard is the one... They're all fucking terrible now.
[220:39.91]Like, think about it, like... No one's left.
[220:41.71]There are no more bastions of game content creation that aren't.
[220:45.77]Maybe, like, some of the indie studios.
[220:47.25]Right now, it's CD Projekt Red is people's, like, darling.
[220:51.03]That's, like, the studio who's like, Oh, Cyberpunk.
[220:55.30]It's gonna be my game.
[220:56.28]It's my game of the year now, and I can't even play it yet.
[221:01.18]Maybe.
[221:03.08]But, I mean, there really is no bastion of... I'm not saying they deserve it.
[221:07.86]Alright, alright, alright.
[221:09.28]Nintendo is fair.
[221:10.40]Nintendo is fair.
[221:11.83]That's a fair thing to say.
[221:13.23]But I don't think it's fair to say Nintendo is thought of as if they can do no wrong.
[221:16.93]I think it's thought of as, I can't believe that they got Switch right, is most mentalities.
[221:22.43]It seems like the reverse.
[221:24.47]After Wii U. Because during the Wii U era, it certainly wasn't Nintendo can do no wrong.
[221:31.26]But I think back in like, maybe like 10 years ago, there were a handful of those companies that existed where it was, they can't do anything wrong and all they do is great shit.
[221:38.96]Which was true at the time.
[221:42.76]Not so true anymore, though.
[221:47.86]And that's not to say that those companies don't make good products.
[221:50.72]It just means that they don't have that.
[221:54.70]They're not synonymous with that anymore.
[222:00.58]And, uh...
[222:03.43]Even Rockstar is slowly becoming kind of a Valve Blizzard type company.
[222:08.36]I'm going to hold my reservations on Rockstar until Red Dead 2.
[222:12.86]Well, they've kind of become like an online... They just want to do online.
[222:16.62]I think they were too far into Red Dead 2 development to like... Once they realized how successful GTA Online was for printing money.
[222:27.19]Forget about online though.
[222:28.27]I mean, it's a huge important thing.
[222:29.53]But GTA 5 was fantastic.
[222:33.18]No, it absolutely was.
[222:34.02]But they made that game five years ago.
[222:36.14]Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[222:37.38]That's what I mean.
[222:37.76]Like, if Red Dead 2 is not, you know, good, then maybe we could talk about that.
[222:44.94]It does piss me off a little that there's... We had two great DLC packs for GTA 4, and they just didn't make any single-player expansion.
[222:52.87]That's because they don't make any money.
[222:54.31]That's exactly what I'm saying.
[222:55.35]But they would.
[222:55.93]They would make money.
[222:57.39]Not enough to tell to their investors.
[223:00.91]Maybe, but I don't know.
[223:06.68]because they give investor reports on how well GTA Online is doing.
[223:13.56]It's going to heal just because.
[223:15.96]This just became the video game podcast stream.
[223:18.66]Yeah, it kind of has.
[223:22.48]That's what we do, though.
[223:23.04]We just talk about whatever we're going to talk about.
[223:25.29]It could be anything.
[223:27.63]I know, but we've been saying we should do that for a long time, and it just kind of did.
[223:32.73]Whatever.
[223:35.31]They released a game every year until GTA 5, yeah?
[223:37.97]And then they just started making Card Shark, Card Cash, whatever it is.
[223:42.41]Whatever the hell those things are called.
[223:44.95]And nobody bought them, they just hacked the game anyways and gave themselves a trillion dollars.
[223:48.33]So that works real well.
[223:53.10]And yeah, that's absolutely going to be a thing in Red Dead.
[223:57.56]What, just like fake dollars?
[223:59.42]Oh yeah, they're going to do the same exact formula.
[224:02.96]I don't expect any different.
[224:05.94]Oh no.
[224:07.64]But that doesn't mean that Red Dead's not going to be a great, fantastic experience.
[224:18.45]Find the source of the disturbance.
[224:21.94]Are we supposed to be up there or down here?
[224:25.10]Good question.
[224:29.93]I'm coming to the conclusion that Fire Mage may be a bit strong.
[224:33.25]Uh, yeah.
[224:35.75]That seems like a really great class.
[224:39.03]Just exploding hundreds of enemies.
[224:40.87]It's just murdering hordes of enemies.
[224:42.49]I've been walking in a straight line, unable to kill anything.
[224:47.20]Until now.
[224:47.68]And now they're dead.
[224:52.00]This seems real great.
[224:55.38]I'm sure that's not the case on the higher difficulties.
[224:59.57]It's probably really good early.
[225:01.69]Nice comedy combat you're doing there.
[225:03.25]Are we missing one?
[225:07.59]Somebody said Riot.
[225:08.61]Wait, what's that Monster Hunter game that Riot is trying to make?
[225:11.43]What is it called?
[225:13.46]Monster Hunter game?
[225:14.46]What's the Riot Monster Hunter game?
[225:16.70]There's a game like Monster Hunter called Dauntless, but who's that by?
[225:21.42]That's Riot, isn't it?
[225:22.74]Isn't Riot making one of those?
[225:26.77]Whoops.
[225:27.01]What is it called?
[225:28.79]I don't know what you're talking about.
[225:34.24]Somebody knows what I'm talking about here.
[225:35.76]It is Dauntless.
[225:37.84]It's not Riot.
[225:38.48]What is it?
[225:38.92]It's like ex-Riot employees, right?
[225:47.09]That game has some connection to Riot.
[225:49.19]Somebody at Riot decided to make that game.
[225:56.48]I don't know why that's in my head, but it's there for a reason.
[225:59.70]So it is an ex-Riot developers.
[226:08.47]Good thing those are homing.
[226:11.57]How are the homing arrows, by the way?
[226:13.39]Are they any good?
[226:16.00]Nah, I hate the special of this guy.
[226:17.96]Really?
[226:19.22]Do they have piercing?
[226:20.62]I mean, it's cool, but I'd rather do one of the other more interesting moves.
[226:28.46]It's actually a great team.
[226:31.78]What, like our team comp right now?
[226:34.30]No, no, no, no.
[226:34.78]They're talking about Dauntless.
[226:36.18]Oh.
[226:39.27]Our team comp's pretty sick.
[226:45.65]Anyway, where were you going with Riot, anyway?
[226:49.69]There are ex-Riot devs that are on the Dauntless team.
[226:53.59]Okay.
[226:54.19]But we were talking about, like, developers like Rockstar.
[226:57.46]Yes, we were talking about, but we were also at the same realm, mentioning, like, are there any bastions of companies that just make good shit?
[227:06.44]And I guess, I mean, I thought I was corrected immediately that it's not Riot that's making that, but is League really... No, I am... Quiet!
[227:16.69]Quiet!
[227:17.27]Be quiet!
[227:18.49]Nope!
[227:19.29]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, not going there.
[227:20.97]Not saying that.
[227:22.03]Nope!
[227:23.48]I don't even know what's happening.
[227:24.70]Don't even matter.
[227:25.14]Just not going to even talk.
[227:27.71]Vermintide 2.
[227:28.65]Here we go.
[227:31.35]No.
[227:37.95]Careful.
[227:39.15]Careful.
[227:39.69]Is there a source bot here?
[227:43.61]Just... That's it.
[227:46.07]We're just going to talk about... We're just going to be careful here.
[227:49.43]We're going to move on.
[227:51.34]How about that?
[227:51.98]How about Rockstar?
[227:52.96]How are they doing?
[228:06.15]Go ahead.
[228:07.01]You first.
[228:08.01]What do you mean me first?
[228:09.37]I'm not going to say a word.
[228:10.75]I'm not saying a word.
[228:13.45]The next thing... What's that famous movie quote?
[228:16.91]Choose your next words.
[228:18.95]Be very careful.
[228:19.95]What is it?
[228:22.64]It's like Lord of the Rings or something.
[228:24.96]Lord of the Rings.
[228:25.98]There's a guy that says, like, your next words may be your last or something.
[228:31.51]I don't know what it is.
[228:32.59]Dark Souls?
[228:33.09]No, that doesn't happen in Dark Souls.
[228:34.37]It's Dark Souls.
[228:41.30]Oh, so 300.
[228:41.50]Yep, 300.
[228:43.70]Choose your next words carefully, Leonidas.
[228:46.18]Because they may be your last.
[228:47.24]And then he kicks Leonidas into the hole.
[228:49.15]No, the other way around.
[228:50.29]The thing I just said, but in reverse.
[228:51.77]He kicks the messenger.
[228:53.21]Yes.
[228:54.25]Into the pit.
[228:57.37]Alright, so that's what I have to do.
[228:58.65]I have to choose my next words carefully.
[229:00.01]Otherwise, I'm going to get kicked into a pit.
[229:09.06]I did that scene.
[229:10.70]I actually did.
[229:13.29]Alright, this guy's making this game really easy.
[229:16.59]The fire mage?
[229:17.21]Yeah, I want to be that guy.
[229:19.33]I want to be him.
[229:22.75]I mean, it seems cool.
[229:23.49]He's a tier 3 one.
[229:24.81]He's got the sword.
[229:25.57]Oh, he actually has the sword.
[229:27.33]Yeah, so he's level 15.
[229:28.09]Whoa, boy.
[229:41.70]Leonidas dies in the first 10 minutes of the movie.
[229:49.21]Leonidas is the one that goes in.
[229:52.81]It was him the whole time.
[229:55.47]They kicked the wrong guy.
[229:58.61]Historically inaccurate.
[230:02.49]What about Counter-Strike?
[230:04.35]Counter-Strike's not made by Valve.
[230:05.45]Yeah, Valve didn't even make that game.
[230:07.73]This goes by different devs.
[230:10.24]Yeah, but CSGO was made by different people, and then Valve came in with a... They bought the devs.
[230:14.30]Well, Valve came in later and, like, redid a bunch of shit, right?
[230:16.94]Because... Wasn't CSGO, like, really unpopular when it first came out for, like, a year?
[230:21.81]It was.
[230:22.41]It was very unpopular.
[230:23.45]Am I level 5 finally?
[230:26.31]I hope so.
[230:29.63]So I can get a trait?
[230:33.89]Talent point unlocked.
[230:34.79]Cool.
[230:34.89]Let's see what it is.
[230:40.32]Hidden Path originally developed the game, yeah.
[230:44.55]This is true.
[230:47.75]Just like how Turtle Beach made Left 4 Dead.
[230:52.36]And then they went on to make the terrible Monster game.
[230:57.04]They make really good headphones too, apparently.
[231:10.35]Oh, no.
[231:11.57]You got the chalkboard.
[231:12.61]You got the answer circled.
[231:13.77]I didn't.
[231:14.29]Oh, my... Wow, you didn't even get... I got one, and I tied for one revive.
[231:18.80]Yeah, so, but I had more kills than you.
[231:20.34]I had more special kills than you.
[231:21.56]You had six, like, eight more kills than me.
[231:25.00]First place is better than... I have three more clan rat kills.
[231:28.66]When Usain Bolt won by a hair, he didn't win first place by a hair.
[231:33.76]He got first place.
[231:37.06]Still got a green chalk circle, and you didn't, so...
[231:41.22]That's all that counts.
[231:43.28]It's like saying you went down the ski jump and you got further distance than me, but I got the gold medal.
[231:48.56]Or I got the bronze medal.
[231:50.98]I want to get a blue.
[231:52.24]We're not playing well enough to get a blue.
[231:54.34]I got a green and a blue.
[231:56.04]What?
[231:58.65]Because I got a chalk circle.
[232:00.11]Naughty Dog hasn't made a bad game.
[232:02.71]Oh.
[232:03.73]Wait a minute.
[232:04.25]That might be true.
[232:06.07]Hold on a second.
[232:06.73]Neither has FromSoftware.
[232:09.65]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[232:11.37]Put on the brakes there, dude.
[232:13.90]Were the first, like, seven armored cores any good?
[232:19.20]I couldn't answer that.
[232:20.14]I have no idea.
[232:20.82]Before my time.
[232:25.60]Shit.
[232:26.22]I don't think Naughty Dog's made a bad game, but I think Uncharted, like, 1 and 2 does not stand up to the test of time.
[232:34.51]Really?
[232:34.67]Because I tried to play it.
[232:37.22]You just remember the era in the mid-2000s, the cover-based shooter era?
[232:43.28]Yeah.
[232:43.60]Where every game was just, you just hide behind a wall, and then you pop up and shoot, and that was the whole game?
[232:51.90]Yeah.
[232:52.46]It was around for a long time.
[232:53.40]That's Uncharted.
[232:55.38]Dark Souls 2 was terrible.
[232:56.84]Yeah, but here's the thing about Dark Souls 2, though.
[233:08.26]This, so, alright, I attribute Dark Souls 2 to, I enjoy Dark Souls 2.
[233:15.38]But the reason why I enjoy Dark Souls 2 is because there's like 70 bosses in Dark Souls 2.
[233:21.55]There's so many pieces of content in Dark Souls 2 that it's just kind of extra content on the Dark Souls franchise.
[233:30.49]Even though it might not be like the best Dark Souls, whatever.
[233:35.12]I thought it was, like, good enough.
[233:37.91]It is an absolute shitload of bosses in that game.
[233:41.21]And if you just want, like, Dark Souls FromSoftware content, it's there.
[233:50.62]Somebody's moving me around.
[233:51.52]Am I gonna get pushed off of the mountain right now?
[233:57.96]We're getting very close to being able to do... How do you even push someone?
[234:04.81]Dark Souls 2 is an expansion pack.
[234:06.07]Yeah, look at Dark Souls 2 like an expansion pack.
[234:08.41]And you'll think the game is way better.
[234:14.27]Revive speed?
[234:14.99]That's pretty handy.
[234:18.01]Dark Souls is not a good game series.
[234:21.73]Hey, that's like your opinion, man.
[234:24.07]Um... It's weird because... Objectively, that person's correct.
[234:34.91]how can you be objective though well because like Dark Souls the actual video game Dark Souls is made for a very specific particular amount of people yeah but that's not a good that's not a good reason that's like saying FIFA is an objectively bad game because it's made for people who like soccer or football which is objectively awful oh no I fell off the cliff
[235:07.63]I'm kidding.
[235:08.31]Jesus Christ, guys.
[235:09.39]I'm fucking around.
[235:14.19]I'm crafting everything down.
[235:21.00]Every game is objectively awful.
[235:23.78]Yeah.
[235:24.72]It was a bad criteria.
[235:27.18]Change the criteria.
[235:27.90]Can you change the criteria for me?
[235:31.25]I don't think that the... I think what you said originally was correct FromSoftware's
[235:36.42]Like, Dark Souls series, I think, is a good series.
[235:40.06]I don't think you can say objectively it's bad.
[235:42.20]But, I mean... Even... Hold on.
[235:47.29]But even, like, the gameplay of Dark Souls is a little wonky.
[235:53.43]It's a little weird.
[235:57.53]I don't really follow your line of reasoning here.
[236:01.67]Why won't you play this with me?
[236:05.01]Play what?
[236:05.91]Why won't you play Anger the Audience with me?
[236:08.99]Oh.
[236:09.09]Is that what we're doing?
[236:10.91]I was trying to.
[236:11.53]I couldn't tell.
[236:12.44]You wouldn't, like, get on board.
[236:13.30]You should have picked a less obvious... You should have picked something like that neither of us liked, but everyone else does.
[236:19.44]Then I would have been on board.
[236:22.50]I fucking... I love Dark Souls.
[236:24.66]Dark Souls is like... That's why I was like, I couldn't... I didn't follow you because you clearly were talking...
[236:30.50]nonsense like you that's like your favorite game so like how would you expect me to like oh yeah your favorite game yeah like oh it sucks you're right I'm glad you said it because I didn't want to be a guy don't even said Bloodborne sucks no don't you dare that's my favorite game ever alright let me craft and I'm we're like one or two levels before we can do it
[236:57.93]One or two more games, and then we can play the hard difficulty.
[237:02.59]How do you craft?
[237:04.35]Oh, okay.
[237:04.93]Never mind.
[237:06.17]Am I crazy for thinking that Demon's Souls was better than Dark Souls?
[237:08.81]Am I cra- am I- is somebody gonna be really mad that I said that?
[237:13.49]Somebody will be mad.
[237:14.99]Maybe.
[237:15.43]I- I hope not.
[237:18.45]Oh, um, you can just- if you go to five out of seven, page five, you can use your scrap to upgrade an item you'd like to its next tier.
[237:28.13]Instead of crafting a random new one.
[237:29.85]Well, that's good to know.
[237:34.03]I literally just puked.
[237:35.55]I just puked.
[237:38.15]I liked Demon's Souls more than I liked Dark Souls 1.
[237:46.67]I have the utmost respect for Dark Souls 1.
[237:50.33]But I think, personally, I believe Demon's Souls is a better video game than Dark Souls 1.
[238:02.29]Pokémon is overrated.
[238:08.21]So how do you do that?
[238:09.41]Reroll equipment.
[238:10.63]Reroll equipment.
[238:11.87]Upgrade item.
[238:14.11]How do you upgrade items?
[238:15.15]Do you have to unequip it?
[238:16.27]You have to have tin scrap, I think.
[238:18.84]Yeah.
[238:20.64]And then you put the item you want to upgrade in the box.
[238:26.10]But I think if you unequip everything first, is that... Can you only upgrade stuff you don't have equipped?
[238:33.21]I'm assuming.
[238:36.11]Well, no, that's not true because there's two other weapons in here.
[238:41.07]Let me see.
[238:42.41]I should really give it another try.
[238:44.39]If you have something equipped you want upgraded, you have to unequip it first.
[238:47.91]Well, I need 20 to upgrade.
[238:49.88]Can I do it now?
[238:50.70]Yeah, I need 20.
[238:52.44]It's 20 for a rare.
[238:55.10]Oh.
[238:55.88]I have a bow, though.
[238:57.00]Let me try to do the bow.
[238:59.86]This one, longbow.
[239:02.34]weird to have this on a page-based system.
[239:05.28]Yeah, it is a little weird.
[239:10.12]Let's see what I get.
[239:12.05]And I can't, like, sort.
[239:13.13]I think I might just keep all my scrap for the next... Well, it doesn't matter if it's going to get erased.
[239:22.55]Yeah, this is all going to get erased anyways, who cares?
[239:24.67]I want to use, like, the other guy's stuff that I'm about to get to.
[239:31.40]The thing is, I probably really would love Dark Souls 1 if I went back and tried to play it again.
[239:35.96]But I think I've just become so spoiled by the games that they've made that I like more.
[239:46.98]I like the hub system that's in Demon's Souls and Bloodborne.
[239:53.15]I know that might be an unpopular opinion maybe for some people or for a lot of people.
[239:58.11]That's why it's an unpopular opinion, I guess.
[240:00.69]But I like just here it is.
[240:03.94]Go do it.
[240:04.86]It's going to be fucking hard.
[240:05.88]Do it.
[240:08.85]The connected world of Dark Souls 1 is one of the main selling points of the game.
[240:13.37]But I would much rather just click on a gravestone and go to the next level.
[240:17.48]So, I mean... Here's something I can guarantee you guys.
[240:22.50]When the Dark Souls remaster comes out, I'm going to play through the whole thing.
[240:27.82]How does that sound?
[240:28.68]Because, I mean, why wouldn't I?
[240:29.74]I've already done pretty much everything else on stream.
[240:32.02]That was Dark Souls 3, at least.
[240:34.96]Is Dark Souls Remastered going to be high-res textures or is it going to be like change the game at all?
[240:43.26]That's a good question.
[240:44.87]They haven't shown any gameplay yet as far as I know.
[240:46.93]It's just kind of that one cutscene.
[240:51.43]Does Bloodborne have that system?
[240:52.75]Yes, it does.
[240:55.11]Bloodborne has a headstone system where there's a hub world, you buy and sell.
[241:01.63]That's why I liked Dark Souls 3.
[241:02.61]Okay.
[241:05.08]Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, Demon's Souls, they all have that.
[241:08.94]And I really very much enjoy that system.
[241:15.12]It's just going to be what the PC version was.
[241:17.67]It's just DS fix.
[241:21.17]Really?
[241:26.75]It's in the DS3 engine?
[241:30.01]That would be amazing.
[241:32.98]Oh, if they put Dark Souls 1 in the Dark Souls 3 engine and they remaster it, and Dark Souls 1 is like the quintessential best one, it'll be my favorite game ever made.
[241:44.97]If it's that system, it's that engine.
[241:49.98]Oh.
[242:01.00]I think Etalyx, we're waiting for Etalyx?
[242:04.15]It's false.
[242:04.55]We don't know if it will be on DS3 Engine.
[242:06.29]Okay.
[242:09.31]And then where's... FromSoftware is way bigger fish frying right now, I think.
[242:16.26]What's that new game that they teased?
[242:19.58]The game.
[242:20.08]Video Game Awards.
[242:23.84]Which... Oh, sorry.
[242:24.88]What I meant to say was instead of Video Game Awards, it's Games That Made the Most Money This Year.
[242:33.07]Pretty much it.
[242:39.60]You didn't think Blighttown was that bad?
[242:40.68]I got through Blighttown.
[242:41.60]I made it through Blighttown.
[242:43.96]My frames really are fucking dying right now, huh?
[242:53.69]At least it's not enough to be a problem, I don't think.
[243:04.71]I think we may have lost Etalyx.
[243:06.11]Are you in the new lobby?
[243:07.43]Yeah.
[243:09.47]I am.
[243:14.51]Well, now I am here.
[243:17.50]Have you heard of the Swapper?
[243:18.58]A really cool puzzle game.
[243:20.72]Etalyx?
[243:22.06]You've played the Swapper, right?
[243:23.90]No.
[243:24.84]Have I?
[243:26.35]Maybe you haven't.
[243:28.17]I was waiting for you to be like, yeah, well let me tell you all about it.
[243:31.35]The Swapper is from 2013.
[243:36.01]it was are you ready to do level three are you okay are you okay for level three we have I mean I'll do it it's just gonna suck is it something oh I don't even know what I did you queued up for the wrong one so I'll decline and you can try again okay uh I really don't want to do level one again though let's just do level three are you sure you can handle it yeah we'll be fine alright
[243:59.75]It'll be okay.
[244:01.11]It's not really, even aside from technical issues, not my really favorite mission.
[244:08.89]It's kind of just, the whole shtick is guys in the wheat.
[244:12.69]Yeah, it is.
[244:13.67]Yeah, I got through Blighttown, but Blighttown was the point where I said I don't think I want to play this game.
[244:23.80]Like, I beat Blighttown and was like, yeah, wow, holy shit.
[244:28.75]I didn't like any of that.
[244:30.97]I don't know if I want to do this anymore.
[244:33.53]And I stopped.
[244:36.03]I believe the sneaky fire mage from the last round got it back in the same game.
[244:41.14]Hey, well good.
[244:41.92]Free loot.
[244:48.56]Sword is cool.
[244:49.28]What about this new bow that I got?
[244:52.92]It's really cool.
[244:56.27]Why are we still talking about Dark Souls?
[245:02.46]The key to Flytown is not actually playing it and just running through it.
[245:09.22]Yeah, but you have to experience it for the first time once.
[245:15.74]I mean, that was the first time I ever played that.
[245:18.52]Maybe if I had gone through it a few times and that was my fifth or sixth character, I don't just want to be like, hey, I decided to play this game.
[245:25.78]I'm going to skip a shitload of it.
[245:27.49]I want to see the game.
[245:28.45]I want to see what's there.
[245:32.98]Play Dark Souls while eating KFC.
[245:34.96]You said it again, now I want it again.
[245:44.15]The bosses in Dark Souls 1 were hard.
[245:46.79]By the way, Capra Demon first strike.
[245:50.85]I'm not going to be able to prove that, but I beat Capra Demon first strike.
[245:55.16]I dealt with the dogs.
[245:57.56]I went through a system where I just continuously ran them around and dropped down and R1'd them.
[246:02.95]First try.
[246:08.48]Does no one else have this game?
[246:10.80]Apparently not.
[246:11.70]Apparently we're the only three people that have this video game right now.
[246:16.46]Because, I mean, anyone could join.
[246:18.00]Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[246:19.60]I'm going to stand inside the waystone.
[246:22.24]And then be right back to take my own pee break.
[246:24.90]Okay.
[246:26.03]But I'll be... Oh, no, no, no, no.
[246:27.73]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, F10.
[246:29.67]I got out.
[246:30.77]No, I F10'd it.
[246:31.53]I canceled it.
[246:32.19]Wait, does that mean... Does he leave?
[246:33.47]Did we just kick him out of the matrix?
[246:35.55]No.
[246:36.11]We have to re-queue again because we stay in the same lobby.
[246:38.47]Alright, so you stay out until the fourth guy gets here.
[246:41.63]Okay.
[246:49.14]Looking for the fourth guy.
[246:49.76]I'm just gonna stay out.
[246:51.48]Okay.
[246:52.08]I'll be in here.
[246:52.68]I'll be back in just a minute.
[246:54.53]But when you're ready to go... Then hop in.
[246:57.85]Yeah.
[246:58.65]Oh, we got somebody already.
[247:00.13]Make that pee break quick!
[247:02.61]Um... But here's the thing.
[247:05.87]Demon's Souls... The bosses... Half of them were really, really, really easy.
[247:12.06]And... But there were like three or four bosses in Demon's Souls that were very difficult...
[247:22.77]The areas in Demon's Souls were interesting, though.
[247:25.99]I liked the areas.
[247:26.83]I just liked the game, too.
[247:29.29]Why am I about to walk into this?
[247:30.79]He just told me not to do that.
[247:40.55]Who's my favorite boss in the entire series?
[247:42.95]Are you talking about all games or just Dark Souls?
[247:44.61]Because if you're talking about Bloodborne included, Ludwig is the best boss fight of any video game that's ever been made.
[247:52.65]without a doubt in my mind that fight is the most interesting most just crazy heart-pounding boss fight ever it was awesome the music the the phase changing the second phase you just didn't expect it was fucking incredible
[248:25.77]Garamond was cool, but Garamond was not on the level of Ludwig for me.
[248:29.43]Ludwig had that halfway point that you just didn't see coming.
[248:32.05]And it was just... Everything about it.
[248:35.74]I can't even describe the feeling.
[248:37.80]Because it's a perfect feeling.
[248:41.66]You can't compare anything after you fight Ludwig.
[248:43.90]You just can't.
[248:48.66]Was I going to change games eventually?
[248:50.02]We were going to get to...
[248:53.38]I'm still just kind of having fun killing monsters.
[248:56.26]And I do want to try to get to the, um... At least try one time on the hard difficulty.
[249:05.05]Because I want to see what kind of loot you can get.
[249:06.45]I want to see how much harder it is.
[249:07.33]Because I don't know.
[249:08.31]I'm gauging right now if I want to actually play this game when it comes out in March.
[249:15.07]That's what... We are live figuring out if I want to play this game in two weeks.
[249:21.51]I guess that's why it's a beta test.
[249:23.63]How did I get over here?
[249:25.37]You got pushed off.
[249:26.73]They threw you off the mountain.
[249:28.71]How did I get... I was... What?
[249:32.67]And here's the thing, guys.
[249:34.31]Etalyx has not even... What did I do?
[249:36.39]Etalyx has not even seen the best video game boss ever made.
[249:40.47]It's unfortunate, I know.
[249:41.99]Are we talking about Bloodborne DLC?
[249:43.91]We are talking about the first boss of the Bloodborne DLC.
[249:46.19]You have not seen it, and it's very unfortunate.
[249:48.64]Are you ready?
[249:49.52]No, somebody left.
[249:51.84]No one is joining and staying.
[249:56.56]That's right.
[249:57.62]Slave Knight Gale was awesome, too.
[249:59.36]He was fucking fantastic.
[250:03.66]Funnily enough, interesting you brought that up, Slave Knight Gale is probably the only boss fight in the whole Dark Souls 3 DLC that I actually really liked.
[250:16.12]I did not even finish Dark Souls 3.
[250:20.80]I would put him at number two.
[250:24.63]I don't remember why.
[250:25.49]That guy would have stayed if I queued in time?
[250:31.25]Well, Etalyx wasn't even here.
[250:32.23]What are you talking about?
[250:34.73]I am here now.
[250:36.13]Seriously, nobody watching the stream has this game?
[250:39.24]Maybe not.
[250:41.28]I find that improbable at best.
[250:43.72]Rockblood raiding parties are cutting loose in the fields around- I'm trying to think of how to think of- Ah, you know- You just smell bad.
[250:50.26]Um... Not for any real particular reason, but... Gascoigne would be number three for me.
[250:55.80]I just liked the character Gascoigne.
[250:57.28]It was fun.
[250:58.22]It was interesting.
[250:59.32]I liked his, like, little intro.
[251:03.26]Stop doing that, Etalyx.
[251:05.16]Stop doing what?
[251:08.94]Somebody's already- How is that person this far ahead already?
[251:11.26]It's because he skipped the cutscene.
[251:12.62]Oh.
[251:16.43]He's the funny haha.
[251:17.65]I've already played these three missions 30 times and unlocked all the characters, teammate.
[251:21.56]Why does it have to be haha?
[251:23.46]Because you just got to do haha.
[251:25.44]Oh, I don't know.
[251:26.47]It's haha because it's like a funny joke that it's like, look at the red shiny thing because I'm all the way up here joke.
[251:32.47]That's why it's haha.
[251:33.60]That is true.
[251:34.14]That is a ha-ha.
[251:34.84]But... Oh, little Ocelot!
[251:36.96]Thank you.
[251:37.58]What was that guy?
[251:38.40]That weird... The weird, um... It's the weird slippery dragon in Bloodborne.
[251:44.00]Oh, little Ocelot, you little baby.
[251:46.10]I like that guy, too.
[251:48.70]Osiris?
[251:49.30]No, what was his name?
[251:51.70]Osiris?
[251:58.50]Was that Dark Souls?
[251:59.06]No, that was Dark Souls 3.
[252:01.06]And for whatever reason, on this map, textures on enemies don't load.
[252:05.28]Really?
[252:06.00]That's weird.
[252:06.44]Yeah, I'm gonna submit a bug report, and they're gonna give me, uh... No, do it, do it.
[252:10.10]...a bug report bonus.
[252:11.22]Yeah, do it, do it.
[252:12.68]That's... I mean, if you're seeing, like, an actual bug, then definitely that's why they're doing this, right?
[252:19.22]Can I please hurt this guy?
[252:20.88]Apparently not.
[252:28.41]Finally.
[252:28.87]Holy shit, that guy was the hardest enemy.
[252:32.51]Yeah, I can't kill these guys.
[252:40.28]It's just Normandy.
[252:41.82]What did I just say?
[252:42.58]It's like all these machine gunners over here.
[252:45.98]I got him.
[252:48.88]Right in the face.
[252:51.34]Oh, right in the head.
[252:53.97]Through the grass.
[252:54.65]Oh.
[253:01.23]I can finally see what's going on now.
[253:03.57]Oh, I can tell you what my least favorite boss in any of those games is.
[253:08.20]What's that?
[253:09.02]Of any Dark Souls or Bloodborne boss.
[253:10.82]It is the Scholar.
[253:12.62]It is the last boss of the DLC in Dark Souls 2.
[253:16.88]That was fucking stupid.
[253:20.16]That boss was dumb.
[253:21.66]Like, really dumb.
[253:25.04]It was just Lord Zedd from the Power Rangers, half of his body coming up from the ground.
[253:29.23]It was dumb.
[253:31.66]I don't even know half of the people you're talking about.
[253:33.52]I'm having a completely separate Dark Souls conversation.
[253:43.17]I'm so sorry.
[253:44.37]It's okay.
[253:49.89]What the hell was that?
[253:50.77]Why did it stop?
[253:51.83]We've got the big boy... What is going on?
[253:55.60]Oh fuck, yes we do.
[254:03.61]Right in his butt.
[254:04.47]Oh, shit.
[254:05.27]Not good.
[254:10.82]Oh, I got a big guy over here, and I'm not good at fighting big guys.
[254:13.34]I actually have a few big guys.
[254:18.68]Drink it!
[254:20.63]Well, this was a mistake.
[254:26.09]Wow!
[254:27.21]Wow, he's right here!
[254:28.37]He's right here!
[254:28.93]Oh, no!
[254:29.91]No, no, no!
[254:33.14]Oh no!
[254:33.72]In the house!
[254:34.39]Get in the house!
[254:35.97]Get in the house!
[254:37.47]Close the door!
[254:38.67]Oh!
[254:40.09]Help me!
[254:41.41]He's... How did he get in here?
[254:45.89]Oh god damn it.
[254:48.05]This is not good.
[254:51.27]Why can he do this?
[254:52.69]Close it!
[254:53.27]Oh shit.
[254:54.13]Oh, you closed yourself.
[255:00.21]Of course he can reach me from there.
[255:01.89]At least I died outside where it's easy to get.
[255:03.57]Okay, we're all alive.
[255:06.25]He's just only attacking me though, so I am dying.
[255:08.45]Oh shit.
[255:10.29]I got a bomb.
[255:10.69]I don't think he's hitting me.
[255:13.29]Watch this one.
[255:13.75]Three, two, one, action.
[255:18.57]Why'd I do that?
[255:19.31]What a fucking idiot.
[255:20.15]You can't fuck around right now.
[255:22.63]I was trying to do something cool and I just placed it on the shelf.
[255:30.41]Oh, was that a potion?
[255:32.05]Aww.
[255:33.30]Thank you.
[255:39.72]People are making fun of me right now, and I don't... I don't blame them.
[255:43.99]Alright, here we go.
[255:45.11]We'll give you 20 Dark Souls questions, okay?
[255:47.81]Oh, please don't.
[255:48.99]What is your favorite boss in Dark Souls 3, and what is your least favorite?
[255:52.63]I only played half of Dark Souls 3.
[255:54.39]Oh, shit.
[255:54.89]Never mind.
[255:56.17]Dude.
[255:57.35]Oh, yeah.
[255:57.63]I forgot.
[255:58.49]This is just like a conversation in which I don't belong.
[256:02.62]Alright, well just go stream the rest of Dark Souls 3.
[256:07.63]Hey, let's talk about what your favorite boss in Monster Hunter: World is.
[256:10.75]Who is it?
[256:12.83]Is it the... Wait, I mean, if you want to be real?
[256:17.03]No, it's a joke.
[256:18.27]The floating, like, white fur cat thing.
[256:22.78]The polyomeu, whatever it is.
[256:24.56]That's the greatest.
[256:26.18]Let me rephrase my list.
[256:27.74]That is the best boss of any video game ever made.
[256:31.38]Wow.
[256:32.72]Those are big words.
[256:35.53]Any video game ever made.
[256:37.29]I'm just kidding.
[256:43.09]Well, ever since I turned off sun shadows, I'm doing a little better.
[256:45.47]Is it better?
[256:45.79]It's a little uglier, but it's a little better.
[256:50.99]We're just doing TV talk with Dark Souls.
[256:52.93]Alright, yeah, let's move on.
[256:53.84]We're not even playing Dark Souls.
[256:56.92]There hasn't been a Dark Souls.
[256:57.94]Dark Souls is not currently relevant.
[256:59.02]You don't have to convince me.
[257:02.30]I'm just trying to convince you to stop talking about it, because it's like literally like the only thing you've been talking about for like 25 minutes.
[257:09.58]Watch out, one of those stabbers is coming around this side.
[257:11.17]I love how he says assassin rat.
[257:18.21]He calls out his name.
[257:29.65]Where?
[257:31.30]Back near you?
[257:32.80]Where's the rat?
[257:33.32]Where's the hook rat?
[257:38.99]I don't see a hook rat over here.
[257:47.47]I wonder, are the books in the same place every time, or are they in different spots?
[257:50.69]I wonder if it's randomized.
[257:55.50]I wonder.
[258:06.62]You want a Wild West-themed Souls game?
[258:10.88]Yeah, but how do you do, like, guns with the same combat techniques?
[258:16.99]Uh... Yeah, I guess you just don't.
[258:19.65]That's kind of where it falls apart.
[258:22.47]Yeah, at its very face.
[258:26.39]I did that.
[258:30.92]That was me.
[258:36.40]I guess, like, it was in Bloodborne, but... Yeah, but it wasn't the main part of the game.
[258:42.34]I guess you're right.
[258:51.17]That character is so deadly, it's unbelievable.
[258:55.73]Like, holy shnikes.
[258:57.09]You're so deadly.
[259:02.82]I feel like I'm swinging a wet noodle.
[259:06.88]I don't trust this quiet.
[259:12.81]What was that so funny for?
[259:15.51]That was a callback to like two and a half hours ago.
[259:18.93]What was it?
[259:22.49]You had to be there.
[259:23.96]Okay.
[259:26.56]Did I accidentally make a funny joke?
[259:29.14]No, no.
[259:29.74]I just killed the fucking pig and...
[259:33.16]That was mean.
[259:34.89]Why would you- what?
[259:37.05]Oh.
[259:37.57]Secret!
[259:39.55]How did you find the secret?
[259:41.81]Because I was paying attention and I was really starting to think about- But you criticized the other guy for shooting it, didn't you?
[259:47.76]Nah, I went to the wiki page and I made sure to figure out what it was.
[259:55.62]Bomb around!
[260:00.18]Okay, I just tried to say three different things.
[260:03.31]I'm sorry, ugh.
[260:04.47]I'm like, my head hurts.
[260:07.05]I was gonna say bombs away.
[260:09.47]And I forgot what that was halfway through saying it.
[260:14.79]Fucking hell.
[260:15.35]It's okay, you're with family now.
[260:17.44]I know, really.
[260:20.74]Bomb around!
[260:21.70]It's like that, what's that, what's that like 60s song?
[260:28.12]I don't know.
[260:28.86]Get around, get around.
[260:33.73]Yeah, exactly.
[260:35.23]That's the Beach Boys, I think, right?
[260:36.75]Yeah.
[260:38.21]Thank you for picking me up on that.
[260:41.33]No, that's not actually the Beach Boys.
[260:47.31]Find the key.
[260:48.87]Is this game new?
[260:49.37]Yes, it is.
[260:52.03]It's so new that it's new.
[260:53.97]You say it.
[260:54.27]You do it.
[260:54.71]Easy, easy.
[260:57.07]it's so new that you can get it in early access I was gonna say not even out yet but you know that works too that's why it's subverted your expectations because you pre-order the game and you get the content that's unfinished literal okay I'm thinking that this level confuses my computer
[261:24.47]And the CPU, it just makes a compromise where it's like, alright, your CPU is maxed, I see.
[261:29.18]So, I'm just not going to load the enemy textures all the way in.
[261:32.22]I mean, I'm getting some hang-ups.
[261:37.74]I'm getting some hiccups.
[261:39.06]But, I'm at pretty much like 50 to 70.
[261:43.49]It's doing hiccuping.
[261:46.07]I'm at like 30 to 55.
[261:51.13]I'm definitely higher than that.
[261:54.18]But every once in a while it goes... If I open my browser and I see... A giant rat.
[262:02.11]Give me a demo.
[262:05.71]If you open up your browser and see a giant rat, then what do you mean?
[262:08.66]Because this guy's like right here.
[262:10.70]He's a giant rat.
[262:11.88]Yeah.
[262:12.62]Well, he's a rat ogre.
[262:13.64]He's dead now.
[262:15.12]That was the fastest we've ever beaten that guy.
[262:17.14]It's because we have one of those magicians.
[262:19.58]If I open my browser and I see that a new 1080 Ti is not $1,400, I'm just going to buy it.
[262:25.76]I'm going to impulse buy it.
[262:27.64]Why?
[262:28.04]What?
[262:28.54]No, don't do that.
[262:29.74]Then I'm going to build the rest of my computer.
[262:32.46]Why would you do that?
[262:34.72]I want to get a stream PC.
[262:36.58]I want this to be my stream PC, and then I want a new gaming PC.
[262:39.77]My internet's dying.
[262:40.65]Yeah, so you can get a new internet.
[262:43.55]I'll get a new graphics card.
[262:44.71]Can I get a new internet?
[262:45.91]Or what?
[262:46.37]Like, what's going on here?
[262:47.29]Come on, man.
[262:48.10]This is some horse shit.
[262:50.52]How many frames have you dropped?
[262:52.36]Almost 10,000.
[262:55.32]Almost 10,000.
[262:55.86]Oh, that's not bad.
[262:58.58]Well, it's actually really, it is not that bad, because it's 0.9%.
[263:03.03]I've almost dropped 1% of every frame as of like 30 minutes ago.
[263:12.61]Yeah, it is a monopoly.
[263:14.55]I can't do anything about it.
[263:16.46]I have to move my house.
[263:19.66]To not have this internet anymore.
[263:22.08]I'll get him.
[263:22.87]When that gopher pops out of the hole again, whack-a-mole style, he's done.
[263:25.53]Fuck.
[263:33.81]Fuck.
[263:42.80]move two blocks?
[263:45.24]Well, um, Comcast has a monopoly in the entire state of Massachusetts.
[263:52.06]I would have to find the one or two specific towns and, like, want to live there if I want to get, like, Verizon.
[263:58.30]Hey, well, when you, you know, whenever you're looking for a new home, you basically just move wherever there's good internet.
[264:04.83]That's what, that's, dude, that is the plan.
[264:06.13]It's a sad truth.
[264:07.33]The next move, like, I'm moving.
[264:10.28]Excuse me, what, where can I get, like, liquid, liquid quick internet?
[264:15.14]Like, what can I, I want to get, like, a liquid fiber internet, whatever the hell the new thing is.
[264:17.97]Uh, we're moving, we're splitting up here.
[264:23.95]Oh, are we?
[264:24.79]I don't know which way is the way to go, but me and Fire Guy are over here.
[264:27.87]I'm also there in spirit, shooting arrows.
[264:31.41]You guys are saying, help us.
[264:34.83]And then we go this way, and it looks an awful lot like a dead end.
[264:40.73]I want liquid cooled internet.
[264:42.67]But it's not.
[264:43.31]It's a secret.
[264:43.93]There's a secret there.
[264:45.92]We got the book, right?
[264:48.24]What's the book?
[264:48.98]Oh, yeah, we have a tome.
[264:50.24]We have a tome and we have a fiddlesticks.
[264:53.84]Whatever I have.
[264:54.40]Fiber optics uses light photons.
[264:57.10]Yeah.
[264:57.44]Yeah.
[265:07.67]Hey, what's the best shadow of the Colossus boss?
[265:10.77]Hold on a second.
[265:12.89]Photons.
[265:14.59]Wait, what?
[265:15.11]You ever been on... You ever been on the Cowabunga?
[265:19.39]The straight down, like, 90 degree slide?
[265:21.59]Water slide?
[265:23.25]I have not.
[265:23.87]At Six Flags, New England?
[265:25.76]Are you telling me that's... Okay, but your photons are faster than that.
[265:32.60]You're talking about internet.
[265:34.20]Yeah.
[265:38.82]Body slides suck, and I think they should all be deleted from water parks.
[265:43.40]There's never enough water.
[265:47.74]I always get some kind of skin burn.
[265:50.80]Why don't I just take that?
[265:51.68]That was so unnecessary.
[265:54.86]Make sure we don't leave that tomb.
[266:08.37]I don't think a water slide goes as fast as the speed of light.
[266:12.03]Well, then you've never rid- you've never ridden on the Cowabunga!
[266:14.91]They had to close that ride down.
[266:24.99]There was an injury every 40 minutes on that ride.
[266:29.02]On the Cowabunga?
[266:30.02]On the Cowabunga!
[266:31.72]Well, if you make this drop straight enough, then you're basically just falling, right?
[266:37.48]What is the actual park in New Jersey that is notorious for being, like, hurts people?
[266:45.52]And the guy's like, I'm not changing anything ever!
[266:47.72]What is that place called, or did it recently close?
[266:50.42]The one that's all made out of metal?
[266:52.32]No, it's an actual amusement park.
[266:55.46]Where the guy, the owner, doesn't care.
[266:57.62]He's, like, happy that it's dangerous.
[267:00.30]I don't know, I thought you were talking about the one where the whole park is, like, man-powered.
[267:04.70]No, no, I'm talking about Action Park.
[267:08.37]You have to ride every ride like a bike.
[267:10.61]You pedal.
[267:12.41]Wait, what?
[267:14.11]There's a real-life park where all the attractions are not electricity-based.
[267:18.35]They're all physics-based.
[267:19.41]You have to pump them and pedal them and stuff.
[267:24.05]I'm serious.
[267:25.25]It's all made out of scrap metal from a recycling yard.
[267:27.97]Why would you want to do that?
[267:29.02]That doesn't sound like fun.
[267:37.86]Can I get some ammo?
[267:39.26]Can I get some ammo, please?
[267:42.51]And here's some ammo.
[267:44.93]Really?
[267:45.77]No.
[267:46.69]Sorry, I lied to you.
[267:47.69]Lied to me?
[267:48.65]Again?
[267:49.03]This is like the third time to stream.
[267:52.01]Is my internet seriously going to be like this?
[267:53.79]Do I have to stop streaming because of this?
[267:57.12]I wanted to stream for at least six hours.
[267:59.12]Is it getting worse?
[268:00.26]Yeah, it is.
[268:00.68]It's like every ten seconds it's happening.
[268:03.38]Well, can one of us stream without problems?
[268:05.40]Because for me, I can't even see.
[268:09.77]It's like I have all the settings on very low is what it looks like.
[268:12.69]Really?
[268:17.99]Watch out for the rats.
[268:25.72]goodness stream something that uses less bandwidth well there's nothing to do with the down it has to do with the up yeah you you choose how much bandwidth you consume what do you stream at uh five thousand yeah that's not even as high as you're allowed to go no you can go to six uh I you can go to six but I don't want to go to six I don't do it either I feel like six is a little too much
[268:54.39]I think five is a good enough quality, but not too much.
[269:06.40]How many people get more than five megabits per second download?
[269:12.68]I don't know.
[269:14.72]Around the world?
[269:15.16]Around the world it's probably lower.
[269:20.30]Viewers on Twitch who get five or less download.
[269:25.67]Hey, how about streamers on Twitch that get five or less upload?
[269:30.81]Can I raise my hand?
[269:36.63]Me, me.
[269:39.87]I have 250, 100, 250.
[269:40.63]No, no one asked you 250 years, okay?
[269:43.97]We're asking for five or less.
[269:46.94]You don't have to brag about it.
[269:55.30]I'm gonna say, no, I'm gonna, wait, you think we're gonna get one more big bad guy?
[269:58.34]What do you think?
[270:00.10]Uh, we have to get at least one more.
[270:04.56]Probably.
[270:09.14]Oh, I'm just throwing it in there.
[270:10.04]Forget it.
[270:12.03]And a good thing that was worth nothing.
[270:16.01]It's okay, there's no friendly fire.
[270:19.95]He's already dead.
[270:23.21]Wow.
[270:31.55]Five, uh, five down is nothing.
[270:33.45]Yeah, you actually, you'd be pretty hard pressed.
[270:36.75]Um, at least in America.
[270:37.87]To find a plan that doesn't give you at least, like, 20, 10 to 20 down.
[270:44.72]Usually, at least, right?
[270:45.50]If you're one of the unfortunate, like, AT and tiers.
[270:48.24]Yeah, but some people that live in real far out, like, rural areas, I mean, they, a lot of satellite internet.
[270:54.40]Satellite, but I think satellite is, is... I don't think it's very good.
[270:58.62]Satellite is like, I think satellite is like two and a half, right?
[271:01.78]It is.
[271:02.38]Yeah, it's less than five.
[271:03.48]Yeah.
[271:18.50]Almost shot that into the ground.
[271:20.52]Good thing I didn't.
[271:27.90]I'm not gonna waste these.
[271:29.16]Whoa, actually, yeah I am.
[271:37.31]Yep.
[271:39.87]Any bigger guys back there?
[271:51.53]I hear something.
[271:54.23]Who's talking?
[271:55.99]Oh, that guy.
[271:57.78]You get like three down.
[272:00.94]I don't even care about down, to be honest.
[272:03.20]There.
[272:03.62]How's that?
[272:04.62]How's what?
[272:06.00]Sorry, not you.
[272:07.10]Oh.
[272:08.54]Down is... I could have 25 down and I wouldn't even care.
[272:13.10]As long as I... If I had 25 down, 25 up, oh boy, oh boy, I would be happy.
[272:21.89]Reliably more than 10 up, 20 up, would be such a huge improvement for me.
[272:28.20]I think, yeah, we did it.
[272:33.82]Because download really is not that much of a concern for me.
[272:36.24]I mean, yeah, it sucks when you're trying to download a game, but you can just leave something on overnight.
[272:47.90]22 down, two and a half up.
[272:49.76]That's pretty typical, I think.
[272:51.76]Pretty standard.
[272:55.04]That's why I want Fios so bad.
[272:57.30]The base Fios plan is $35.35.
[273:00.98]And that shit is dog shit cheap.
[273:09.55]It's so cheap for their base Fios actual fiber optic internet plan.
[273:25.67]merchant's strongbox that's better than we had last time he got the same circle too dick I have 50 30 for like 29 wow
[273:51.35]but just talking about prices my internet is supposed to be 75 15 and it is like 130 dollars a month it is the comcast business internet and it don't it don't and I'm not reliable for that businesses you know what I'm saying but not so reliable isn't that the whole point though that's the whole point like you're supposed to have business technicians yes
[274:17.42]that make sure your internet is working the way it's supposed to at all hours of the day.
[274:22.34]100 down 6 up to $40.
[274:25.77]That was my understanding.
[274:27.69]That's fucking so much better.
[274:32.27]Give me blue.
[274:32.77]Alright.
[274:33.47]God damn it.
[274:35.13]Still no blue.
[274:35.55]Did you get a blue chest this time?
[274:36.93]No, not this time.
[274:38.00]I haven't gotten one.
[274:41.96]I only got a bunch of commons.
[274:44.20]I got triple green here.
[274:46.41]Just all necklaces and trinkets.
[274:48.12]Yeah, Comcast is the only option.
[274:52.50]There are no other providers that are in... I mean, look, I could get Verizon, but I can't get Fios.
[275:01.76]I could get this shitty DSL internet, which is worse than what I have now.
[275:05.95]They just don't have the... I mean, you've pretty much exhausted all of your options.
[275:09.79]Oh, yeah, there's no other options.
[275:11.67]We're way far past that.
[275:13.31]Yeah, we are.
[275:14.35]Big time.
[275:16.85]What did I even open?
[275:20.45]You could just do DSL.
[275:21.11]I opened a bunch of terrible stuff.
[275:23.53]Get a goddamn phone line in here and let me lose like 90% of my speed.
[275:28.52]So can you only get blue dust by... Oh, you reroll properties.
[275:32.86]Never mind.
[275:34.66]This is more.
[275:36.78]Almost there.
[275:37.12]What is it, 120?
[275:37.52]We need to get to 120?
[275:39.24]What is a trait?
[275:40.08]Is that like a set bonus?
[275:41.84]Because it uses an orange dust.
[275:43.67]I'm not sure.
[275:46.08]There might be weapons that have, like, specific traits in terms of, like, stat bonuses besides just crit and stamina.
[275:56.87]I want to unlock the next guy.
[275:58.05]I need to level up one more time.
[276:05.26]We're so close to being... What's your hero power?
[276:07.66]I'm at 102.
[276:07.92]About to be higher, though.
[276:09.18]106.
[276:09.20]Maybe if we...
[276:18.95]Maybe I can dump some stuff in here and craft something.
[276:26.52]Just make your own internet.
[276:27.46]I don't even care about having it that fast.
[276:32.02]I just want it to be absolutely reliable.
[276:33.68]And the thing is, you can.
[276:36.56]Comcast offers a enterprise internet.
[276:41.22]A full-on enterprise solution that is guaranteed to be working and guaranteed to work as
[276:48.00]Ah, that shit's like $600 a month.
[276:52.58]I don't... I don't make that kind of money.
[276:55.74]I can't afford like $1,000 a month internet.
[277:00.93]And that would just be way... That would be just paying so overkill for no reason.
[277:06.79]You can get enterprise internet for like a fucking $1,000 a month, but that's designed... If I had like 50 employees in a building and I was the boss and I had a bunch of workers...
[277:25.45]What's the plan for... Are we... You know?
[277:29.93]What do you mean, the plan?
[277:32.93]Like, we're just short of being 120 hero power.
[277:35.90]We are so close that it would be kind of a shame if we didn't.
[277:40.20]My shield texture's not even loading in.
[277:42.00]I'm going to try restarting my game.
[277:44.58]Not that that's helped.
[277:46.82]I'm going to upgrade this sword.
[277:57.66]Can I?
[277:59.66]Yes, I can.
[278:09.21]Plus 2.5 stamina.
[278:10.85]That doesn't seem that great.
[278:18.39]That is just barely worth putting all the materials in.
[278:23.97]I thought you said he had a mansion with 50 people living in it with gates and shit.
[278:26.83]Yeah, but those people don't work for me.
[278:28.17]They just live here.
[278:30.58]We all just live here.
[278:31.42]Plus 2.5 stamina.
[278:43.03]Do you even have a stamina bar in this game?
[278:46.27]I don't even see one.
[278:59.80]We will break him?
[279:00.78]What do you mean?
[279:01.74]How?
[279:02.30]What?
[279:03.50]What are you guys doing?
[279:06.48]That's called an apartment complex.
[279:09.54]I never told you guys that it was anything other than that.
[279:16.67]How did I confuse you guys?
[279:17.73]I don't understand.
[279:18.29]There's probably like 700 people that live here.
[279:23.57]Right in the head.
[279:35.09]What I was asking was... Holy shit, that's a lot of damage.
[279:39.22]Oh, a question.
[279:40.24]If you craft down a blue, do you get comparable resources back to what it costs to craft it in the first place?
[279:46.60]That's a good question.
[279:47.50]I'm not sure.
[279:48.68]Like, if I made it and it was like, eh, I don't want that, actually.
[279:52.42]By the way, crits are not normal crits.
[279:55.40]They're kind of like mini crits.
[279:57.93]Because I'm doing 3800 or so, 3850 damage.
[280:01.23]And when I crit, I do 40... My crit went from 400 to 700.
[280:04.65]Does it really?
[280:06.59]It's almost double.
[280:07.53]Really?
[280:07.77]Because that's 3850, 4325.
[280:09.15]That's a crit there.
[280:11.33]Maybe I have... Because I'm ranged.
[280:14.61]Alright, let's get one.
[280:22.21]Do we... Is this a new player?
[280:23.63]Or did we not even... Did we not... You got a new player because I left.
[280:26.85]Okay.
[280:28.24]I want to switch weapons, but I made a blue of weapon I don't like.
[280:38.36]While you figure that out, I'm going to go through some bits that I've missed over the last hour or so.
[280:42.35]Let me know when you're ready.
[280:44.73]I'll just join.
[280:46.15]Start a new lobby.
[280:46.91]Yeah, I just did.
[280:49.84]I will join.
[280:50.20]Oh, thank you too!
[280:51.14]Let's do some bits while we wait.
[280:52.80]Thanks to SuperSeal for the 25 cents.
[280:54.26]Streamer sued for stupendously slandering Swift slides stupidly.
[280:59.54]What did I do?
[281:03.06]Crits are not worth it.
[281:03.78]Yeah, it's not that much.
[281:07.06]Uh, thank you though.
[281:07.56]Thank you Darkstar7000 for the $1.
[281:09.18]My favorite Soulsborne boss would have to be the wolf you encounter in the beginning.
[281:12.64]Never was able to get past that one.
[281:17.77]I guess that is true.
[281:20.65]That is true.
[281:21.73]What do I mean?
[281:22.19]I lied to Etalyx?
[281:23.11]I just told them I was going to read bits.
[281:24.03]So you're talking about the werewolf in the laboratory.
[281:29.93]If you dodge enough times, you can kill the wolf.
[281:34.92]Thank you, Cali.
[281:35.84]Thank you, Calinth, for the $1.
[281:37.02]Darkstar, again, thanks for the $1.
[281:39.36]Bloodborne is a zero IQ game for babies.
[281:41.56]C2 can play it this game.
[281:46.02]I disagree.
[281:49.57]Pripro, thank you PriproPrap for the 10 bucks here.
[281:54.16]You were part of the people who got me over two fucking horrible years.
[281:57.26]Thanks, dude.

[281:59.22]I'll always be here.
[282:00.00]Thank you.
[282:01.38]PriproPrap.
[282:04.72]Sorry to hear about your latest troubles.
[282:08.32]Two horrible years, that doesn't sound like fun.
[282:11.20]It's a long time in a row to be feeling like bad or having terrible things happen to you or something.
[282:17.67]I'm really sorry to hear that, but
[282:20.55]I'm at least glad that you hanging out here is... Helps.
[282:26.11]A lot of people around here that are, um... Join the Discord.
[282:31.33]Please.
[282:31.61]It's a great community.
[282:36.77]Drunk loser listen to me club?
[282:38.65]What are you talking about?
[282:41.23]I haven't... Drunk.
[282:44.78]Thank you, Prepro, for the 10 bucks.
[282:46.38]Appreciate it, man.
[282:48.22]Darkstar, thanks for the $1 again.
[282:49.88]Oh, ouch, owie, my hands are burning.
[282:52.29]I can't hold all these flesh out of the oven hot cakes.
[282:56.25]What the fuck are you talking about?
[283:01.81]Join the Discord, please.
[283:06.12]And we'll catch back up in a little bit.
[283:09.04]Are you waiting for me?
[283:10.14]I don't think he's waiting for me, so we're going to keep going.
[283:16.17]uh hen hen 724 thanks for the two bucks about the four omegalo female here I don't even know what this is yes you you made like this is one of those somebody just made like nine references in one sentence I don't even know what it means something about four sentence in here too somewhere thank you hen hen I appreciate the two dollars thanks man
[283:42.90]For Fernandes, thanks for the $15.
[283:45.10]They don't say anything, just cheer 1500.
[283:47.45]Thanks, man.
[283:51.15]And we'll go... Hey, I'm going to queue us up.
[283:55.17]Which one do you want to do?
[283:56.01]It really doesn't matter.
[283:58.05]It doesn't even matter.
[283:59.57]We'll do the first one.
[284:02.42]It'll be really great when there's like 20 missions.
[284:05.48]Huh?
[284:06.18]Huh?
[284:07.05]It'll be really great when there's like 20 missions.
[284:08.63]Yeah, it's going to be really fun when there's more missions to play.
[284:12.14]Here's the thing.
[284:12.92]We're going to get to the point where we can... Alright, we can unlock the hard mode and we're going to be both done with the fucking game.
[284:18.46]We're going to be like, I don't want to do this mission again.
[284:21.61]I feel like it should be like...
[284:25.04]Next.
[284:26.47]What I'm going to do is I'm going to craft my necklace into a blue because I feel like that has more room for higher power than a weapon.
[284:33.95]And you can change it between your characters.
[284:36.29]If you switch to the next level seven character, then you could just take the necklace off or just keep the necklace on, I mean.
[284:44.15]and not have to worry about, like, let's say you upgrade a blue weapon that only your first class can use, then what's the point when you're about to switch?
[284:51.11]Yeah, that's true.
[284:51.84]Give me one second.
[284:53.36]I'm going to buy a new computer, and I'm going to install Doki Doki Literature Club on that computer, and then I'm going to drop that computer out of a 25-story window.
[285:05.68]So, there you go.
[285:08.91]Okay, ready?
[285:11.83]I mean, we're waiting for people, aren't we?
[285:13.98]Yeah, they're here now.
[285:15.38]Oh.
[285:18.06]One sec.
[285:27.13]What?
[285:28.49]Do it on stream.
[285:31.11]We're just having a little bit of a fun time here.
[285:33.47]Just a couple of humans?
[285:34.83]Just a couple of humans.
[285:35.79]Just making some funny things.
[285:36.75]Are you ready?
[285:45.19]I've stepped into the dome.
[285:46.87]I've went through the Portal 2 next level zone.
[285:51.65]I know, hold on.
[285:52.66]GLaDOS is about to say something really funny to me about how my teeth might bleed or something if I step through and I can taste blood.
[285:58.86]I don't have 20 scrap.
[286:01.34]I have 19 scrap.
[286:02.97]I don't know.
[286:10.88]Give me a second, okay?
[286:12.28]I wanna go in at the top of my game.
[286:13.88]I'm playing Dwarf.
[286:14.98]I get last place like every single time in kills.
[286:18.13]Alright, just give me a chance to compete.
[286:20.23]You know what I mean?
[286:22.35]How dare you?
[286:22.91]Alright, well, take your time.
[286:25.47]Fine, take your time.
[286:26.53]Alright, it's done.
[286:27.43]Okay, nevermind.
[286:28.43]Okay, let's go.
[286:28.81]All I have to do is re-equip.
[286:34.95]The cake is alive.
[286:35.53]What is your power level? 106.
[286:39.61]I'm 107.
[286:40.46]God damn it.
[286:43.80]It doesn't show in the in-game statistics, though.
[286:47.44]Am I really going to use this hammer?
[286:52.68]Yes.
[286:53.38]Then we're going to play Farkle.
[286:56.71]We are, yeah.
[286:57.29]We're going to play Farkle in Tabletop Simulator, and it's going to be terrible.
[287:01.05]Is that what it is?
[287:05.92]Come on through.
[287:07.54]Come through.
[287:07.90]Alright, we have to push this person in.
[287:09.08]I'm already through.
[287:13.03]Something with these fire mages, you know?
[287:15.83]Hopefully they're not going to get a sandwich.
[287:17.97]If you pick fire mage, you're pretty much just a type of person.
[287:21.19]Alicia's got a good shot at gaining some proper information about this guy.
[287:25.09]Wow.
[287:26.07]She's going into helm guard, and so are you.
[287:28.85]Difference is, she'll be sneaky.
[287:31.30]I'm not saying anything that controversial.
[287:32.70]Think back to World of Warcraft, like vanilla.
[287:35.06]If you picked rogue or hunter, you were just like a certain type of person.
[287:42.95]Yeah, that's pretty interesting because all the rogues that I've ever came across in that game were always bad, bad, mean, awful people.
[287:50.29]Really?
[287:50.89]Well, we've got anecdotal evidence here, but I think you might be onto something.
[287:58.52]Every undead rogue in World of Warcraft, I was convinced, was like a serial murdering, like, psychopath.
[288:06.91]Have you played Undead Rogue?
[288:10.57]I was convinced there was something wrong with you.
[288:15.11]Just because there was.
[288:19.72]Why did I just... Oh, actually, that worked out.
[288:22.06]Keep this up, and I might not find you contemptible.
[288:28.95]Yeah, I just, I just, have I just done something bad?
[288:32.13]Wow, that's rude.
[288:32.83]I only gank noobs.
[288:34.09]Yeah, because that's why I feel like that.
[288:37.15]Everybody remember, you all have that.
[288:39.21]I was like a, that was like a fucking pre-patch discipline priest.
[288:44.05]And you guys know, if anybody knows what I'm talking about, I was a discipline priest before they made them interesting or good.
[288:49.28]I wanted to be the different guy.
[288:52.95]And I remember dying hundreds and hundreds of times by undead rogues in Stranglethorn Vale as this shitty, dumb, disciplined priest.
[289:00.94]So I can't remember what it's like to kill people in this game recently.
[289:09.71]You forgot?
[289:13.39]Because they all die before I get to them.
[289:14.95]Yeah, dude, you played World of Warcraft back in the day.
[289:17.25]Remember when rogues could... If you were PvPing against a caster, you were unbeatable because you could stunlock them forever?
[289:23.96]And they would do... I would get kidney shot and they would laugh at you, like... And you would go behind... You'd just go behind them and they'd have to look at you to cast...
[289:32.18]It was so horrible.
[289:33.28]You would just run around them.
[289:34.89]Somebody stunlocked me one time for like a full one minute.
[289:38.39]And they were just laughing at me.
[289:39.49]And there's nothing I could do.
[289:40.31]I was like probably five levels higher than this person too.
[289:43.71]I probably punched through a window.
[289:44.60]I feel like that still happens.
[289:45.78]Also help me.
[289:46.86]Where?
[289:47.44]Where are you?
[289:48.71]I was following you guys and then I got indisposed.
[289:52.79]My stream is shitting itself.
[289:54.30]Who's the rogue?
[289:55.42]It's you.
[289:56.56]I'm not the rogue.
[289:56.98]Thanks for nothing.
[289:58.28]I'm not a rogue.
[289:59.30]I'm a hunter.
[289:59.92]But you have like the hunter or the rogue sword.
[290:04.88]I am a ranged class.
[290:09.20]Do you see two blades?
[290:10.48]Yeah, but you can use two blades.
[290:12.14]I see one sword that is a backup.
[290:16.77]You're the closest thing to rogue in this video game that exists.
[290:20.20]I think the Witch Hunter is actually closer to a rogue, in my opinion.
[290:23.44]Have you played as the Witch Hunter?
[290:25.60]Yes.
[290:26.94]No.
[290:27.70]Yes, I have.
[290:28.56]We played it for the first time today.
[290:30.58]What about the game?
[290:31.86]This is not the first game in the series.
[290:33.54]Witch Hunter was in the last game.
[290:34.95]They either redesigned the whole character.
[290:37.69]This Witch Hunter is not like a rogue.
[290:46.35]Jeremiah's still angry.
[290:47.43]No, I'm not.
[290:48.97]I'm good.
[290:50.47]I'm doing well.
[290:51.71]I'm doing fine.
[290:52.19]You know, I wish there was one more level.
[290:57.59]If there was a fourth level in the beta... Yeah, but like... But yeah.
[291:02.62]We've been over this.
[291:03.58]This is ground that's been shred.
[291:05.56]Yeah, we have.
[291:06.70]We've been over this.
[291:07.68]You're right.
[291:12.45]It's okay, because this is not the full game.
[291:14.17]The full game will be out on March the 8th, and they want to make sure that you don't burn yourself out before they're done putting in the final patch.
[291:22.12]Well, I can tell you right now, hopefully there's nothing cool on these three levels, because I ain't never playing them ever again after we do them.
[291:28.22]I'm never playing them again.
[291:29.40]Like, we ain't ever going to do these levels ever again.
[291:31.14]Oh, no.
[291:36.77]Get out of here, you little shits.
[291:39.27]Apparently, the best place to be is up on these stairs.
[291:42.38]I would be inclined to agree.
[291:45.48]Oh, I just got kabobbed.
[291:47.18]I just got kabobbed.
[291:49.69]Oops, I shot you instead of the rat.
[291:51.39]Why do I refuse to acknowledge the name of the game?
[291:53.91]What game?
[291:54.47]Doki Doki Literature Club?
[291:55.67]I said it like four times.
[291:59.73]Why is that?
[292:00.53]Oh, dear.
[292:01.94]That's like the new thing that everyone says.
[292:03.62]It's like the new spore.
[292:05.50]Is it just funny because of its name?
[292:07.48]No, it's funny because everyone wants me to play it.
[292:11.22]And their wish will never be granted.
[292:13.36]Is it like a visual novel?
[292:15.48]It's like an anime, but you gotta play it because there's something weird that happens and it's an anime game, but it's not really.
[292:22.38]Oh, shit.
[292:30.63]I might as well ban myself.
[292:33.93]Might as well ban myself.
[292:35.49]Did you say a meme?
[292:36.27]Yeah, I did.
[292:37.63]Was that the meme?
[292:38.29]I said the word spore.
[292:41.20]How is that a meme?
[292:43.33]Don't even.
[292:43.91]Don't encourage.
[292:47.09]You brought this up, okay?
[292:48.49]So I feel no guilt in asking.
[292:50.69]You feel nothing?
[292:51.11]Wow, dude.
[292:51.57]Check that out.
[292:51.93]I feel nothing.
[292:52.91]Come on, man.
[292:54.37]I gotta ban you now.
[292:56.75]No, don't ban me.
[293:18.27]Explain the meme.
[293:20.83]There's no meme.
[293:21.53]Everyone wanted me to play Spore one time.
[293:23.27]You did, though.
[293:26.40]Did you or did you not actually do that, though?
[293:28.82]I did.
[293:29.10]I played, and the game was all broken and fucked up and caused everybody to have a headache.
[293:34.22]How is that still a bannable offense, then?
[293:35.91]Because everybody kept saying it.
[293:38.81]Even though you already played it?
[293:41.11]Yeah, that's the joke.
[293:42.33]Now you're going to get them all riled up.
[293:45.95]That's kind of what I do.
[293:46.77]I don't know if you noticed, but that's kind of what I do anyway.
[293:50.47]Imagine if you really just didn't feel anything.
[293:54.42]Imagine if you just did... Did you evolve that way?
[293:56.08]No, no, imagine if there was no sensory, like, when you touch things.
[293:59.52]Like, I don't feel anything.
[294:00.46]So what you're saying is, like, as an amoeba, when you grow and obtain some new body parts, you don't feel anything?
[294:08.51]Yeah, and then, like, you could take those body parts and go from there to walk around and eat stuff and dance, maybe?
[294:18.17]That would be kind of interesting, like, if you did that.
[294:22.54]Dance.
[294:25.00]Just imagine, but let's be real here.
[294:27.36]If you couldn't feel anything, if you felt nothing, you wouldn't be able to even touch anything.
[294:32.01]You wouldn't be able to grab anything.
[294:33.41]You wouldn't understand.
[294:34.35]That condition exists.
[294:35.55]It does?
[294:35.81]That's how people get their legs cut off when they get diabetes.
[294:41.14]Well, I'm talking, like, specifically, like, if, like, hands, arms, like, if you can't, like... But I'm saying, like, a microcosm of what you're talking about exists since... That must be so terrible.
[294:50.11]...that people lose their legs because if you can't feel anything, if you get a small cut or incision and it can't heal itself, you don't know it's there, so it gets infected, and then you get gangrene and you lose your, you lose your limbs.
[295:01.30]What the fuck?
[295:02.04]Why?
[295:02.42]That's so terrible.
[295:03.26]That's awful.
[295:03.84]So if you couldn't feel anything, you would get infected, you wouldn't know it, and you would end up losing limbs, pretty much, in that order.
[295:11.37]When is, like, Bill Gates gonna come out with a thing that, like, cures every disease?
[295:20.16]Can you feel anything when you have leprosy?
[295:22.26]I don't know.
[295:28.08]That's in Windows 11.
[295:30.97]Yeah, you plug yourself in and... If you cut, like, gas, it'll get rid of it.
[295:41.91]Potions!
[295:46.37]Where's the tome?
[295:46.81]I got indigestion.
[295:47.57]We have one tome.
[295:49.82]Is that why you asked what happens if we can't feel anything?
[295:52.02]Because of the indigestion?
[295:53.06]No, I'm saying that you can cure your indigestion by plugging a USB in.
[295:59.72]Chat's on a whole nother level than you right now, I'm sorry.
[296:03.27]They're on a whole nother level than me.
[296:05.81]They're so woke right now.
[296:08.85]Dear.
[296:13.14]Why is there, like, an ocean behind me?
[296:15.06]Oh, it's this.
[296:15.66]It's because they have group things.
[296:19.02]Chat is just, like, Twitch chat is the first iteration of the AI, like, web that has the neural net.
[296:28.05]Twitch chat is early version, like, alpha of a neural net.
[296:33.33]Somebody said, what is this conversation?
[296:35.55]Yeah, it's called Five Hours in Vermintide 2.
[296:37.67]This is what happens.
[296:40.55]Start talking about curing illnesses and headaches with a USB device.
[296:44.46]How come nobody's opening the doors?
[296:50.22]What if there's secrets?
[296:59.40]You can shoot people way faster than me.
[297:00.96]I do have a bow and arrow.
[297:05.06]That's true.
[297:06.20]I have a gun.
[297:09.20]And it misses.
[297:11.49]I didn't miss.
[297:16.83]What a deep convo.
[297:19.63]Apparently I'm down.
[297:21.67]Again.
[297:24.89]How did that happen?
[297:26.39]I don't know.
[297:26.95]Dwarf sucks.
[297:29.35]Spore sucks no dwarfs.
[297:33.99]I can't get off that apparently You want it to live that mean I wanted to play one that lived the boy who live no no it wasn't actually Stop saying it
[297:59.59]Hey, Greg, give me your health potion.
[298:01.67]Okay.
[298:04.19]Thanks.
[298:04.89]All you had to do was ask.
[298:07.31]I did?
[298:08.44]I didn't say it demandingly.
[298:09.76]I mean, it was a demand, but it wasn't like... I thought you were going to hit that guy.
[298:13.92]That would have been bad.
[298:15.92]You would have loved that.
[298:17.48]Hmm?
[298:19.34]What would I have loved?
[298:20.84]You would have loved to friendly fire kill that guy.
[298:24.25]That would have been very funny, actually.
[298:25.71]It would have hit him right in the face.
[298:27.93]Best case scenario, the cannonball did kill him.
[298:31.25]Worst case scenario, it did not.
[298:32.64]Then we talk about it afterwards.
[298:35.10]Yep.
[298:36.20]And we go, man, wouldn't it be funny if... Chest.
[298:40.78]Oh, hold on.
[298:43.62]No, not another kebab.
[298:49.49]Oh, boy.
[298:51.00]Oh, boy.
[298:52.56]You good?
[298:53.28]Yep.
[298:55.12]I am now.
[298:57.78]What's in the box?
[299:01.50]What's in the box?
[299:06.11]Why are they all attracted to me?
[299:08.65]There's nothing in here.
[299:11.87]Why is everyone so attracted to me?
[299:15.75]Oh, ammo.
[299:17.47]I need it.
[299:21.01]I'll take it.
[299:21.51]Thank you.
[299:23.71]Only after I get what I need first.
[299:27.21]No, that was an infinite ammo crate.
[299:29.15]Anybody could participate.
[299:30.14]Infinite ammo.
[299:30.84]Infinite... The emphasis is on the F. Infinity.
[299:37.46]I know, I've heard the argument.
[299:39.66]One is a car, the other is a... Okay, forget about this conversation.
[299:43.21]Get out of here and close the door.
[299:54.63]Why is he getting health?
[299:57.27]Uh, maybe he's, like, eating his own vomit?
[300:00.53]No, he's regurgitating and then regurgitating?
[300:03.83]He's first gurgitating, then regurgitating.
[300:09.53]That's gross.
[300:14.81]I didn't think there was gurgitation in this game.
[300:19.73]Gurgitation gets you every time.
[300:27.02]Killing rats.
[300:27.78]That's the name of the game.
[300:29.78]It pretty much is.
[300:31.16]They are half the enemies.
[300:33.31]Well, it is vermin tide.
[300:35.69]That is true.
[300:37.25]But, like, are rats the only kind of vermin?
[300:42.21]Um... Like, if someone, like... Maybe there's mosquitoes.
[300:47.73]There's mosquitoes.
[300:48.75]So it's just a coincidence that you lean towards the rats and the mosquitoes?
[300:53.64]Yeah, there's mosquitoes, rats...
[300:56.75]Let's find out.
[300:57.87]Porcupines.
[300:59.18]And vermin.
[301:05.80]Pests or nuisance animals that spread disease or destroy?
[301:09.69]Crops of life.
[301:10.29]Yeah, like beetles, worms.
[301:14.43]Locusts?
[301:15.40]Locusts, bugs.
[301:22.63]That guy said wait for some reason.
[301:24.27]Whoa, why am I... Oh, okay.
[301:26.43]We're doing the... That's what happens.
[301:28.47]You get minus max health when those are picked up.
[301:33.03]Oh, yeah.
[301:34.53]No wonder we're dying so fast.
[301:36.31]I cannot come back there.
[301:37.99]Yeah, if you get the three books and the other items, they just increase the amount of experience you get for your box.
[301:45.54]And what's happening back there?
[301:48.36]What's happening back there?
[301:49.30]I'm here by... I'm gonna stay with you.
[301:50.20]You're gonna stay with me, man, because we're gonna get...
[301:51.97]Because you might just get pulled.
[301:53.77]They can work as a team.
[301:55.45]They're coming this way.
[301:56.92]There's a lot over here.
[301:57.92]You need to come down.
[301:59.24]Oh my fucking god.
[302:00.70]Now you really have to come down.
[302:02.68]You fell off the ledge.
[302:05.50]I panicked.
[302:05.90]I'm not going to lie.
[302:11.33]Luckily I had smoke bomb.
[302:13.85]But we are in trouble.
[302:16.75]He fell right off the ledge.
[302:22.58]Got him.
[302:23.26]Got him.
[302:27.00]I so badly want the Ghostbusters proton pack.
[302:29.10]Look at that thing.
[302:29.62]Are you serious?
[302:31.10]That's mage.
[302:31.78]You gotta be mage.
[302:33.36]That's the best class.
[302:34.24]That is so good.
[302:35.81]You're always mage, aren't you?
[302:37.05]I'm surprised you didn't pick it.
[302:37.85]Pretty much.
[302:38.45]I wanted to try something different, though.
[302:52.26]He just kills him instantly.
[302:57.19]Farkle.
[302:57.77]That guy wants to play Farkle.
[303:01.73]What are we waiting for?
[303:02.59]Alright, we got it all.
[303:04.21]We got all the books.
[303:05.03]We better do this.
[303:06.67]All we have to do is escape.
[303:08.14]We'll be level 7.
[303:09.64]We'll get a new class.
[303:10.84]And we can finally hopefully also be hard mode tryhards.
[303:26.33]Right in the head.
[303:26.91]I got him in the head with all three arrows.
[303:28.86]Bingo.
[303:29.34]Somebody said, don't play bot.
[303:41.32]Was there an ammo box down there?
[303:43.56]Oh, yes, there was.
[303:45.44]It was to the left.
[303:46.86]I got it.
[303:47.20]I mean, they're right.
[303:50.90]It's a terrible game.
[303:53.60]What, Farkle is?
[303:55.28]Yes.
[303:55.90]One of the worst, actually.
[303:56.84]It's one of the worst games, but it's a game you want to play.
[303:59.60]No.
[304:00.04]You'll understand.
[304:01.34]You gotta ask me again in like a week.
[304:04.77]Reddit.
[304:05.21]Remind me in one week.
[304:07.09]Reddit!
[304:08.27]Exclamation.
[304:08.93]Remind me in seven days.
[304:11.43]Good job.
[304:11.81]Good Reddit joke.
[304:13.71]I don't use Reddit.
[304:14.49]I don't have a Reddit account.
[304:16.71]What is that?
[304:17.39]It puts an alarm clock in your browser?
[304:19.53]I don't have a Reddit account.
[304:20.57]I don't.
[304:20.79]I swear to God.
[304:23.19]So, but it makes it like an iPhone alarm clock?
[304:27.23]How does that work?
[304:27.73]I don't get it.
[304:28.11]I think it's like a bot.
[304:29.41]I think there's a bot that does remind me stuff.
[304:31.65]It should probably, like, send you a private message.
[304:35.79]So why wouldn't you just put it on your iPhone calendar?
[304:38.73]Because it's funnier to, like, have a bot remind you on Reddit.
[304:42.27]Because it's usually, they usually use it when somebody says they're going to do something you don't think they're going to do.
[304:46.54]Uh-huh.
[304:47.44]So, it's usually on Reddit.
[304:50.22]So, since it says remind me on Reddit, then they'll take you to the thread or the guy.
[304:53.76]If you just set it on your phone, you'll be like, what was this for?
[304:57.16]Like, who?
[304:58.54]Uh-huh.
[304:59.72]Where do I go now?
[305:01.22]Speaking of you, where do you go now?
[305:02.34]You're by yourself back there.
[305:04.30]Okay.
[305:06.49]I'm fine.
[305:07.03]Don't worry about me.
[305:08.49]Well, you would not have been in two seconds from now.
[305:13.88]Why are we doing try hard strats on the recruit difficulty?
[305:17.14]Because we have 40% health each.
[305:20.66]I mean, I guess that's true.
[305:21.94]And I want to get the best box we can get.
[305:23.40]Because we haven't got it yet.
[305:24.58]Because I want a blue.
[305:25.79]And I haven't got a blue yet.
[305:26.81]You've got a blue.
[305:27.25]You haven't got a blue box?
[305:28.17]I've got like three blue boxes.
[305:29.67]So we've gotten some unfair odds here.
[305:32.01]But I had regular old common items in them.
[305:35.65]That's weird.
[305:37.13]No, no, no.
[305:37.37]I'm talking about like a blue item.
[305:39.41]Not a blue box.
[305:40.23]A blue item.
[305:40.93]It doesn't even exist.
[305:42.23]Oh.
[305:43.21]But the higher the rarity of your box, the better chance you get of getting a blue in it.
[305:49.39]True.
[305:51.14]So what is your point?
[305:54.35]Watch out behind us.
[306:01.39]My point is that I want to get the best possible reward at least one time this stream.
[306:07.59]Because if we ain't doing it next time... So what happens if you get a box?
[306:11.29]Right, let's say you get like four boxes.
[306:13.13]Sure.
[306:13.51]But you don't open them until you unlock the class that you really want to play.
[306:18.51]Do you then get items and gear from those boxes for the class that you open them with, or do you get them from the class that you first obtain the box with?
[306:29.88]I actually don't know.
[306:31.98]You know what I'm saying?
[306:32.66]Yeah.
[306:33.38]Like, you may want to wait to open them until you're playing with the class you want to beat.
[306:40.67]Not a bad idea.
[306:42.15]I don't know if it matters.
[306:43.21]Maybe it doesn't.
[306:49.10]Okay, I think we survived Was there car coming up there's a really fat guy big fat guy.
[307:11.70]Oh
[307:12.63]Big fat guy.
[307:13.73]With a shaman staff.
[307:15.21]He just teleports.
[307:17.93]He asterisk teleports behind you.
[307:20.61]I'm out of arrows.
[307:21.43]Officially out of ammunition.
[307:28.26]I'm almost out of health.
[307:31.20]I'm not really helping.
[307:44.50]Got the cloaked guy, the guy with the cloaks on.
[307:47.06]They're very annoying.
[307:47.88]He's just, like, jumping up and down.
[307:49.56]Alright, are we almost done?
[307:53.51]Is that it?
[307:55.47]No, damn.
[307:56.41]Another wave.
[307:58.01]Wow.
[307:59.15]Glad I was able to help in this fight.
[308:04.54]Oh, that's a bomb, I think.
[308:10.34]Is there any ammunition down there?
[308:11.82]It's pretty much exclusively the fire mage.
[308:16.19]There's one there's two bags of ammo I think we did it I'm not gonna jump down because we have like all the items and I don't want to have any chance that we're gonna lose them Probably a good idea That guy did though
[308:44.33]He jumped anyway.
[308:44.97]Not me.
[308:46.35]Pick him up.
[308:48.51]Got him.
[308:50.70]I thought you just died.
[308:53.34]I was like, wow, the thing you wanted to avoid.
[308:57.62]The one thing you didn't want to have happen.
[309:06.74]You get the items for the class that you open the box with.
[309:10.93]I'm just going to do it.
[309:11.47]I mean, this is all getting wiped anyway, so who cares?
[309:13.03]Let's open it.
[309:17.37]But does it matter if you open it with... What I'm saying is, like, if you want to do one more round as the next career guy... Right.
[309:25.33]Maybe open it with that.
[309:27.77]With her.
[309:29.82]Yes.
[309:32.60]How come on, soldiers?
[309:33.76]No!
[309:35.32]We didn't get any loot die.
[309:37.06]That's unfortunate.
[309:40.00]I got Emperor's Strongbox.
[309:41.40]Is that good?
[309:42.63]Emperor's?
[309:43.05]How did you get Emperor's?
[309:45.15]I don't know.
[309:45.53]I just got Emperor's.
[309:46.27]Did you not?
[309:47.37]Now I got soldiers.
[309:48.49]This Mr. Mittens, look at you with the fire.
[309:51.37]I know it's all fire.
[309:52.17]They're going to balance fire mages.
[309:53.43]They seem OP.
[309:54.57]They seem really good.
[309:55.86]They can just hit every single thing from range at killing damage.
[310:02.98]Let's try to get to 120.
[310:04.04]Hopefully we can get to 120.
[310:04.76]Because then we can do maybe one or two more after this.
[310:11.19]Because we've seen it all.
[310:12.75]We have seen it all.
[310:15.64]I just want to do it on the hard or difficult just to try it.
[310:18.25]We're probably going to get our asses kicked for just to see it.
[310:21.27]Did I still not get level 7?
[310:25.43]Uh, we did not.
[310:28.43]What is, oh.
[310:30.62]I found another bug.
[310:32.14]Bug?
[310:32.90]Since I ended the last game.
[310:35.22]Fuck.
[310:37.30]Almost dead.
[310:38.86]Everything in here is washed out like I'm about to die.
[310:42.13]Oh, really?
[310:43.05]That's not good.
[310:46.09]Come on, fat shark.
[310:46.93]Game comes out in two weeks.
[310:48.45]No, I didn't get anything to increase my power level.
[310:52.39]No.
[310:53.83]Let's just play Farkle.
[310:57.05]Let's just play Farkle.
[310:58.76]Let's just play Farkle.
[310:59.78]That was the funny joke, right?
[311:01.90]It's not even.
[311:03.76]That wasn't really a funny joke.
[311:09.16]Do you want to know why I even brought it up?
[311:11.88]I mean, why?
[311:12.38]I mean, you told me.
[311:17.91]Alright, I'll just tell you.
[311:19.17]What do you mean you'll just tell me?
[311:20.67]I'll just tell you.
[311:22.59]You said, if you're really that honed in on Farkle.
[311:26.05]Oh.
[311:27.23]The reason I was making a joke and said come back in a week is because it is a minigame in the video game known as Kingdom Come.
[311:37.70]Oh, what?
[311:38.84]I thought it was a Jackbox Party Pack type thing.
[311:42.65]No.
[311:43.39]Oh, what the fuck?
[311:46.58]but you wouldn't let it go.
[311:48.00]So here we are.
[311:49.40]I don't know.
[311:50.10]I told you to come back in a week.
[311:53.20]I thought Farkle was like Fibbage.
[311:57.50]You know, like Fark, like Fark your friends or whatever the hell it is.
[312:01.33]But it's a real life game.
[312:02.65]That's what makes it funny.
[312:03.57]It is a real life game.
[312:04.55]There's a real life dice game called Farkle.
[312:09.73]Damn.
[312:11.89]And it's like, it's like the easiest default dice game that you can play.
[312:18.66]Okay.
[312:19.12]But if you want to play it, we can play it.
[312:21.58]Oh, you can turn your webcam on?
[312:24.40]You know, get on Tabletop Simulator and let's do it.
[312:27.50]I don't even know how that... Dude, I don't even have that... I thought that was you talking.
[312:31.71]I haven't installed... That's not even installed.
[312:34.77]Can you even get... Can you get it on Tabletop?
[312:36.89]Yeah, it's just dice.
[312:37.71]All you need is dice.
[312:38.37]You just need dice.
[312:39.13]Yeah, that's it.
[312:40.63]It's not like there's not... There's no board.
[312:42.01]It's like, it sucks.
[312:43.15]But that's what makes it fun.
[312:44.67]Let's do it.
[312:46.37]but it's not really fun.
[312:47.54]What do you mean it's not fun?
[312:48.82]It's fun in the context of the video game Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[312:53.92]Outside of that, it's not fun.
[312:56.68]This is like Swindlestones from Sorcery?
[313:00.10]Maybe.
[313:00.40]I don't know what Swindlestones from Sorcery is.
[313:02.80]We have to guess who has what for numbers?
[313:06.42]No, it is not like that.
[313:07.44]You have two twos.
[313:08.64]I must have three threes.
[313:10.63]It's closer to Yahtzee.
[313:13.03]Yahtzee?
[313:14.49]It's much closer to Yahtzee.
[313:17.56]I get iPad Yahtzee ads on my video games that I play every day.
[313:23.34]I don't want to play Yahtzee.
[313:24.68]You bet money on it.
[313:25.64]It's gambling, basically.
[313:28.82]Okay, so we're not doing it.
[313:31.46]Well, I mean, that's what I've been saying this whole time, but I'm trying to convince you not to do it.
[313:35.23]You're trying to convince me not to do it.
[313:37.61]Yeah.
[313:39.69]That's why it was just a joke.
[313:41.92]And you were like, let's go play Farkle.
[313:44.34]For real.
[313:46.08]Let's go play Farkle right now, actually.
[313:49.18]You don't want to play Farkle.
[313:51.88]Just play Yahtzee instead.
[313:53.32]They probably have a Yahtzee on Steam.
[313:56.69]No, I'm not.
[313:57.43]We're not playing Yahtzee.
[313:58.91]Nope.
[313:59.55]Not going to happen.
[314:00.21]I don't want to play Yahtzee.
[314:03.13]No one was actually trying to convince you to.
[314:05.83]Somebody in this chat is now.
[314:07.86]Oh.
[314:09.17]Now it's in their heads.
[314:10.20]You can't get it out of there now.
[314:15.90]Alright.
[314:17.26]We didn't make it.
[314:18.04]We didn't get to 120.
[314:18.76]And we've been playing for about five and a half hours now.
[314:23.08]Unfortunately...
[314:25.65]I think we've seen everything.
[314:26.97]We didn't get to do the hard thing yet, but I really, I'm just gonna be honest with you, I don't want to play another one of these same missions again.
[314:33.72]Yeah, it's just gonna make the game worse for us when it actually comes out.
[314:37.36]It's gonna make the game less fun because we're just doing the same thing over and over again.
[314:41.88]So, um, let me... What just happened?
[314:45.37]I believe someone posted a mission.
[314:48.01]Oh, I thought somebody, I thought I just got, like, money.
[314:51.25]I'm gonna disband the party.
[314:52.27]Wait, what does it, what does quick place mean?
[314:55.32]I just left.
[314:55.88]What does it say?
[314:56.52]Maybe you get more rewards for doing quick play.
[315:02.26]What did it just say?
[315:02.96]I don't know.
[315:04.94]I closed that.
[315:05.36]Can you be in a party?
[315:07.70]I think so, yeah.
[315:09.90]What's something we can do for like 30 or 40 minutes just hanging out?
[315:12.23]Are you trying to meet these specific criteria?
[315:16.27]I got a six-hour quota here that I need to beat.
[315:19.19]You trying to fill the quota?
[315:21.43]I told everybody I was going to do at least a six hour stream today, so I gotta fill this quota.
[315:27.85]The backup game could possibly be its own stream.
[315:31.56]I'm not starting Kingdom Come Deliverance right now.
[315:33.58]That's like a full day.
[315:34.32]No, that's not what I was talking about.
[315:35.96]The actual backup game could be its own stream.
[315:40.78]Oh, yeah, I know.
[315:42.53]You're not talking about that.
[315:43.39]No, no, no, no.
[315:43.91]I'm literally talking about playing Farkle.
[315:51.20]Okay, are we gonna Farkle for real money?
[315:52.90]Oh wait, no, we're gonna get banned from Twitch for doing that.
[315:57.13]We could just play Farkle for chips.
[315:59.67]Like, okay, but seriously, think about how funny it would be if we played Farkle, two streamers banned for playing Farkle.
[316:09.43]And betting real money on it.
[316:10.67]Oh my God.
[316:12.31]No, that's not, nobody wants to see that.
[316:14.17]Everyone's fucking annoyed that I just said that out loud.
[316:19.37]I don't want it to stop streaming though.
[316:22.46]Well, your options are limited.
[316:27.39]For another extra 40 minutes?
[316:29.05]What's a 40-minute experience?
[316:30.85]Remember you told me to keep this installed just in case?
[316:35.19]Oh, no.
[316:36.19]You told me.
[316:36.99]I did tell you that.
[316:38.08]And I quote, keep it installed just in case.
[316:42.06]You never know.
[316:43.04]And here we are.
[316:44.06]Alright.
[316:44.32]That's fine.
[316:45.12]Sure.
[316:45.34]Everyone's going to leave.
[316:48.62]That's okay.
[316:49.56]By the way, do you take this as the end of the stream?
[316:51.82]This is the end of the stream.
[316:53.32]Because those of you that are still going to be here, I'm sorry.
[316:57.06]Wait, I think my internet actually just died.
[317:00.21]Did it?
[317:00.47]Yeah, I think my internet actually turned off.
[317:02.83]Really?
[317:03.27]Yep.
[317:04.43]I'm at zero up right now.
[317:06.09]There's no live stream.
[317:07.25]Zero?
[317:08.47]How do you even get that?
[317:09.67]How are you talking to me?
[317:10.59]I don't know.
[317:11.05]Uh...
[317:17.11]Well, we're in straight up perfectly timed.
[317:20.60]I've ripped out my own internet cord.
[317:22.20]People are going to think I did this on purpose.
[317:25.82]No, Jerma is very much still alive.
[317:28.28]I'm still there.
[317:28.94]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[317:29.82]Yeah, might as well just do it.
[317:32.92]Who gives a shit?
[317:34.10]Alright.
[317:34.50]This is the backup to end all backup games.
[317:38.10]Dude, it's still installed.
[317:39.74]It's never uninstalled.
[317:40.72]It's still installed.
[317:43.79]I hope you guys, thanks for joining the stream.
[317:45.43]I can't wait for at least 700 of you to leave.
