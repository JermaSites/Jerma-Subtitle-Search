[00:06.18]I couldn't turn my webcam on.
[00:07.78]I would have held it up for you guys to see.
[00:10.18]That was fucking messed up.
[00:12.23]It was forcing me to jump and moving me down.
[00:14.37]Thank you for the gator.
[00:19.35]Well, I told you.
[00:20.99]I'm a man of my word.
[00:25.11]If I tell you I'm going to do something, then I'm going to do it.
[00:31.12]No one's going to pretend to do something.
[00:34.84]Alright, let's bring it back.
[00:37.02]Let's actually play the stupid fucking game we were supposed to play.
[00:39.28]Bring it back over here.
[00:43.68]By the way, this was voted for.
[00:44.80]I just want to make sure everyone's very, very aware of this.
[00:47.70]I didn't vote for this.
[00:49.49]I voted for Stalker.
[00:53.17]I voted for Stalker.
[00:57.54]Thank you, Purple Rose Tattoo, for the six bucks.
[01:00.11]Thanks for streaming.
[01:00.73]Having a bad day because I found out one of my favorite singers is a sexual predator.
[01:05.17]So here's the money I was going to spend on the next album.
[01:07.62]Jesus Christ.
[01:10.50]Well, thanks for the six bucks.
[01:12.06]That's fucking terrible to hear.
[01:15.43]Um, damn.
[01:18.03]Anyways, man, thank you, PurpleRose.
[01:19.97]Ivory, thanks for the bits as well.
[01:21.49]It's been... He just... This is gonna suck.
[01:23.69]He says the title of the game.
[01:24.65]Oh, this is gonna be bad.
[01:25.73]You guys voted for this.
[01:26.95]And, like, I want to make that really fucking clear before we start playing.
[01:48.38]That didn't even look like Bear Grylls.
[01:51.36]Uh, thank you SmokeWiseGanja.
[01:53.72]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[01:55.52]Nice joke.
[01:56.02]Now buy another 10 alligators or I'm gonna unsub.
[01:59.31]I don't know what you want me to do.
[02:02.31]I did it.
[02:02.69]I bought it.
[02:03.81]We can play.
[02:04.51]I promise an alligator run.
[02:05.92]A real one.
[02:06.84]At the end of the stream.
[02:08.85]But thank you, Ivory, for the bits as well.
[02:10.49]Thank you, Purple Rose.
[02:11.15]Thank you, Spokewise Ganja.

[02:17.14]Whatever your name is.
[02:18.82]Thank you, guys.
[02:19.78]Let's go.
[02:22.72]Man vs. Wild saves data automatically at certain points.
[02:24.68]Whenever you see this icon, please do not power off your console.
[02:27.85]Okay.
[02:30.91]Do you want to save this data?
[02:32.33]Yes, of course I do.
[02:37.51]more alligators.
[02:38.49]We might go back to that.
[02:39.67]We might go back to fucking Tokyo Jungle real quick, okay?
[02:45.52]This could be the worst game I've ever played.
[02:47.86]Yes, I want to save the data.
[02:52.74]Didn't it say it was gonna do this automatically?
[02:55.36]Okay, save complete.
[02:56.92]Play adventure log options or credits.
[03:03.06]Dude, my controller really is, like, fucked.
[03:06.70]Hold on a second.
[03:10.70]The controller... Okay, there we go.
[03:11.88]Better?
[03:12.10]Alright, does... Does DualShock 4 work with PS3?
[03:18.75]Do you guys know if that's... Because, like, this actually is fucking broken.
[03:23.79]Does DualShock 4, the PS4 controller, work with PlayStation 3?
[03:28.23]Because the controller broke when I started.
[03:31.24]It does.
[03:31.79]Okay.
[03:32.15]I'll be right back.
[03:33.67]What the fuck?
[04:54.97]Okay, like, fuck, man.
[04:58.10]I swear to God.
[04:59.00]Gator waiting room.
[04:59.92]What are you talking about?
[05:00.60]You already did it.
[05:04.54]Why, why did my, what, I swear to God, I, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna go and get fucking, I'm gonna go get tested, guys.
[05:11.85]I'm gonna go get tested.
[05:13.27]For, like, electronic STDs.
[05:16.27]I touch anything that has any electronics, and all of a sudden it don't fucking work anymore.
[05:22.52]Like seriously, I'm gonna go get tested for electronic STDs.
[05:30.19]Is this shit gonna work?
[05:31.35]I thought you guys said DualShock 4 works.
[05:43.56]This ain't doing anything.
[05:50.36]What?
[05:52.08]I have to go add a Bluetooth device.
[05:56.44]What?
[06:02.54]Hold on a second.
[06:03.03]What if I just drop this?
[06:05.85]Alright, I dropped it on the ground.
[06:12.03]Oh my lord.
[06:12.71]Alright, hold on.
[06:14.01]Let's see if we can do this.
[06:16.06]I have it connected by USB.
[06:17.78]It's plugged into USB right now.
[06:22.78]I need to... I'm about to fucking throw this thing against the wall.
[06:27.93]I swear to fucking God, dude.
[06:29.19]I swear to God.
[06:30.47]I have electronic, like, something horrible.
[06:35.05]I literally have this fucking controller plugged in.
[06:37.17]USB.
[06:37.59]Dual shock forward.
[06:38.25]It won't fucking work.
[06:41.75]Hold on.
[06:42.13]I think I fixed it.
[06:53.79]Fix it.
[06:55.67]No, it didn't.
[07:00.01]Oh my lord, guys.
[07:00.95]Like, honest to fucking god.
[07:01.95]Okay, anytime you ever, like, have a problem, just fucking punch it.
[07:07.36]And then it gets better.
[07:11.44]No.
[07:15.68]I can't even fucking believe it.
[07:20.64]Like, my old PlayStation 3 DualShock stopped functioning the second I turned the stream on.
[07:27.43]How the fuck does that make any sense?
[07:31.05]I swear to God, I don't know what I have.
[07:33.75]Like, you know, who's that guy in Heroes that can, like, control machines?
[07:39.72]Isn't there, like, a character that can, like, control machines and shit?
[07:46.42]I'm, like, the reverse of that person.
[07:54.13]Batman?
[07:54.61]Dr. Octopus?
[07:57.17]Alright, we're gonna go base camp.
[07:58.47]Training.
[07:58.83]This is gonna be all fucked up, ain't it?
[08:01.09]Alright, bad girls.
[08:03.11]Tell us the fucking mission briefing.
[08:04.23]Here you'll learn the techniques and methods you'll learn.
[08:05.63]I'm fucking... Why does everything break that I try to do?
[08:11.33]I swear to God.
[08:18.51]You guys watch this shit in real time.
[08:25.30]Calm down, Dad.
[08:26.14]Alright.
[08:26.52]Navigate through the obstacle course.
[08:27.94]Fight a snake.
[08:29.55]Catch a fish.
[08:30.25]Build a campfire.
[08:31.15]Go skydiving.
[08:32.79]Is this like a how to survive or is this like an old person's bucket list of like cool things they want to do?
[08:48.56]Alright, here I am.
[08:50.58]Welcome to Basecamp.
[08:52.08]He's gonna see it.
[08:54.04]Okay.
[09:02.72]Select rucksack, start, pause, jump, interact, camera, move bear, guidebook, sprint and sprint.
[09:09.51]Okay.
[09:14.62]First thing you need to know about is the HUD or heads up display.
[09:16.80]The HUD is broken into four parts.
[09:18.24]Hydration, energy, health, adventure.
[09:22.17]Hydration is the blue bar.
[09:23.35]It is constantly draining and will drain faster if you sprint or stay in a warm area for too long.
[09:28.77]Stay hydrated by drinking from your canteen or any clean water sources.
[09:34.43]If hydration runs out, you begin to lose energy.
[09:36.50]As you lose energy, bear will slow down.
[09:38.46]Energy can be replenished by eating.
[09:42.42]If you run out of energy, it will begin to affect your health.
[09:45.14]If the health meter runs out, Bear will be incapacitated.
[09:48.31]Of course, he can't die.
[09:50.51]Can't die.
[09:51.67]Only a good night's sleep can refill Bear's health meter.
[09:54.53]So guys, if you die, just get a good night's sleep, and the next day you'll be fine.
[10:01.49]Adventure.
[10:02.01]Collecting spirits of adventure will give you points towards increasing your rank.
[10:06.31]The adventure meter keeps track of how close you are to the next rank.
[10:10.71]Okay.
[10:13.02]A bear needs to crawl or crouch to get under something.
[10:14.98]What did that just say?
[10:15.54]Alright, what do I have to do?
[10:34.06]I'm gonna rip the fucking thing out on camera.
[10:39.47]It's legit.
[10:41.15]This controller is broken.
[10:42.15]And there's nothing I can do about it.
[10:48.82]Alright.
[10:51.13]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[11:13.07]Nope.
[11:16.21]It just constantly wants me to, like... What if I turn the fucking thing down?
[11:22.49]I didn't do anything to this... I swear to God, you try... I... What a fucking joke.
[11:34.08]Go to Walmart.
[11:35.58]My PlayStation 4 controller is plugged in, but I can't use it.
[11:40.02]Let's do this.
[11:40.90]Ready?
[11:41.20]Let me show you something.
[11:44.23]I'll show you this.
[11:45.47]Pay no attention to all those games.
[11:47.15]Don't, you didn't see those.
[11:49.51]My PlayStation 4 controller is plugged in right now.
[11:51.61]And it don't fucking do a goddamn thing.
[11:56.55]Here's the other controller that you can see.
[11:59.89]What, what, messy, messy room.
[12:01.59]It is a messy room.
[12:03.27]I gotta get this shit ready for the next stream.
[12:06.25]This is the controller that currently doesn't work.
[12:08.16]Here's the one that's plugged in right now.
[12:15.71]This is my DualShock 4.
[12:18.87]It doesn't work.
[12:19.27]It doesn't do anything.
[12:24.70]Did I Bluetooth it?
[12:26.98]No, I mean, I can't even do that.
[12:29.26]Hold on.
[12:29.80]Give me a second.
[12:31.12]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[12:37.52]It's like connected to the other, like... Ay-yi-yi, what a fucking nightmare.
[12:46.66]I have it connected to the USB.
[12:50.52]Use DS4 Windows.
[12:51.60]We're on PlayStation 3.
[12:54.20]I'm not on my computer.
[13:04.69]Fucking stupid ass balls.
[13:09.28]I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna take my balls out in a second.
[13:25.67]Let's go.
[13:30.81]Fuck, it's so mad right now.
[13:38.08]Alright, well, hey, welcome to the stream.
[13:42.68]Hey, wait, wait, wait, oh, you know what?
[13:45.22]No, give me a second.
[14:17.97]They didn't even see it.
[14:20.09]This is the PlayStation 3 controller.
[14:21.67]I've had it for 10 years.
[14:22.47]Fuck you!
[14:37.34]I just get like a fucking banned from Twitch.
[14:39.18]Okay, let's go I'm like starving to death.
[14:47.04]I didn't get the chance to do this.
[14:48.53]Oh my god.
[14:49.31]I hate it.
[14:50.41]I hate this shit Ball showing you didn't see my ball jump forward to grab the rope the controls will be on the right and okay start swinging.
[14:57.23]I Don't know.
[14:58.71]Okay.
[14:58.85]I didn't even jump off the very circle.
[15:00.47]Apparently is jump.
[15:01.25]Oh
[15:07.30]Okay, this is fucking stupid.
[15:10.81]How do I climb?
[15:16.27]I swear to God, though, guys.
[15:17.15]Like, you guys think I make this shit up?
[15:21.59]It's like, it seems like if we used that control.
[15:24.07]Here's the thing I don't understand.
[15:25.13]I'm gonna give you guys a real, like, what in the name of God is going on in my fucking electronic life.
[15:29.13]Oh, shit.
[15:30.39]How do I drink?
[15:31.51]Stay sharp.
[15:32.95]Definitely don't want to fall here.
[15:36.40]Alright, move.
[15:37.88]Move in the opposite direction that it's tilting.
[15:39.49]Well, he's like gonna starve to death on this pole.
[15:43.13]So we played PlayStation 3 on this fucking, on this console with that controller two days ago.
[15:49.03]And then two days later, the controller doesn't work anymore.
[15:52.87]You understand what I'm talking about?
[15:53.81]Like, how would I ever know that it was ever gonna fucking happen?
[15:56.31]There's no way for me to know.
[15:59.38]It's fucking ridiculous.
[16:00.56]It's fucking ridiculous.
[16:02.44]We did this two days ago.
[16:05.58]Combat training.
[16:10.33]You have to charge it?
[16:11.77]It's plugged in.
[16:13.01]It was plugged in with a USB cable.
[16:17.81]Standing dodge?
[16:18.61]Do I have to dodge?
[16:22.85]During fallen dodge, press rapidly to the appropriate button.
[16:26.15]Attack.
[16:28.65]What do I have to fight?
[16:29.57]What is this?
[16:30.03]Fucking Dark Souls?
[16:32.47]Finish it off or... I have to eat it, right?
[16:35.37]Why is this so dark?
[16:36.33]What the fuck?
[16:43.31]Okay, this is... This is fucking dumb.
[16:46.78]Finish him!
[16:48.66]Nice, what a kill.
[16:49.60]Oh my lord.
[16:55.42]Open rucksack.
[16:56.70]And exactly what button was that again?
[17:02.09]Okay, combine items.
[17:05.07]Building a fishing spear.
[17:07.93]First of all, this has got to be like a brightness here, right?
[17:13.62]Okay.
[17:14.76]Pages.
[17:18.99]Badges, skills, records, mature guide.
[17:22.41]Nature guide.
[17:25.19]What button was that to open up my rucksack?
[17:27.43]Does anybody have fucking any idea?
[17:28.79]It was just like a blank square.
[17:33.15]Alright, we followed this.
[17:41.60]Press.
[17:43.84]That is not a button.
[17:46.10]To open your rucksack.
[17:47.05]From here, you can access your canteen and any other items you pick up along the journey.
[17:51.45]Okay.
[17:53.13]Okay, it's select.
[17:54.81]Alright, what do we got?
[17:56.25]We got... What's this?
[17:58.47]Snake skin.
[17:59.05]You can hold liquids in there.
[18:01.79]Okay, this is snake meat.
[18:03.67]Uh, eat that.
[18:04.97]Gotta use the snake meat.
[18:06.84]And drink my canteen.
[18:09.38]Okay, we're good.
[18:10.02]Alright, let's keep moving.
[18:14.36]So mine is gonna be combined, like a stick.
[18:20.87]Go into the rucksacks, like one, and press... Okay, so I can, like, combine items.
[18:25.29]Well, no, I guess I can't anymore.
[18:26.87]I think I already fucked it up.
[18:30.21]Oh, wait, I can get a stick.
[18:32.33]Okay, let's combine the stick.
[18:36.77]And... I already... I ate the meat raw, so I can't even, like, cook the meat anymore.
[18:42.45]What's this?
[18:43.22]Dead bird?
[18:43.96]Take it.
[18:47.02]I got a beak.
[18:50.81]Okay, now I have a dead bird stick.
[18:54.81]It's a spear.
[19:00.10]Oh my god.
[19:01.20]Okay, I can spear fish.
[19:03.23]I get it.
[19:04.91]Get a fish.
[19:05.69]Okay, spear a fish.
[19:06.85]How do I... How do I put the fucking rod on?
[19:14.65]I can't use it apparently.
[19:24.00]Go fishing.
[19:27.50]I was hoping that was going to be... Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[19:33.30]No, I don't got it.
[19:35.44]Oh God, what a fucking failure.
[19:36.82]I'll get it eventually.
[19:37.70]Eventually it'll happen.
[19:44.03]God, that's how you go fishing.
[19:52.57]Okay, basic training is almost... We're almost through basic training.
[19:56.29]This is like an open world game.
[19:57.99]Cold, hot, sick, wet, warm.
[19:59.77]Alright, so I can't tell how cold I am.
[20:01.45]Build a fire.
[20:11.09]Your key objectives and stats for each location can be found in the survival guide.
[20:13.79]The survival guide is five seconds that help you through the game.
[20:16.99]Five sections.
[20:17.83]These sections are goals, badges, skills, records, and nature guide.
[20:20.49]Press to open it.
[20:21.51]Yeah, I know.
[20:22.21]I just did it.
[20:23.45]Make a fire.
[20:24.35]Building camp is essential.
[20:25.83]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:26.53]Fire is essential for surviving in the wild.
[20:28.88]Sleep and cook some food.
[20:30.18]You got it.
[20:30.96]Alright, let's make a shelter.
[20:32.28]Would you like to start the construction challenge?
[20:37.44]What?
[20:38.80]Three sticks and pine needles.
[20:42.62]Okay.
[20:42.90]Oh.
[20:42.98]This really is just like a Warcraft quest.
[20:49.15]Oh, wow.
[20:49.43]Okay.
[20:49.53]Alright, it's time to build the fire.
[20:51.05]What do I have to do?
[20:51.81]Place it right here.
[21:10.96]What is going on?
[21:13.70]What is this?
[21:14.66]What is going on here?
[21:17.74]Do I have to hold these in the right spot?
[21:20.44]Okay.
[21:22.46]If you can't remember everything you need, check the skills page.
[21:25.84]Knife and Flint.
[21:26.96]Strike three times in a row.
[21:27.96]Blow on it.
[21:28.18]If you follow these instructions, you'll have a toasty fire going in no time.
[21:40.57]Okay, uh, you just have to follow this, but there's no pressure sensitivity on this controller, apparently, so it's either all or nothing.
[21:48.41]Got it.
[21:49.01]I'm putting my face in the fire!
[21:50.47]This is not safe.
[21:51.35]It's very unsafe.
[21:52.07]Alright.
[21:52.70]How do I cook it?
[21:53.54]Rotate the meat.
[21:54.70]Hahaha!
[22:09.89]Is this cooked?
[22:11.05]This is cooked, right?
[22:11.87]I mean, this is like kind of burnt.
[22:13.13]Oh.
[22:13.99]Alright, it's ready.
[22:15.30]Disgusting!
[22:15.82]How is that disgusting?
[22:17.52]I did that correct.
[22:29.26]Build a shelter.
[22:30.00]Oh, man.
[22:31.92]Okay, I need some logs, moss, and pine needles.
[22:34.38]Yep, okay.
[22:34.78]Can we be done with the tutorial yet?
[22:36.62]I want to fight a bear.
[22:37.72]Did I just pick up a fucking log?
[22:39.70]Alright, I did.
[22:40.38]Alright, I need to... All I need now is small sticks.
[22:58.10]It was burnt?
[22:59.52]It takes way longer to cook food than that, guys.
[23:01.66]I need one more small stick.
[23:07.89]Come on, where the fuck is the small stick?
[23:09.31]Right here.
[23:10.29]Alright, let's go build the shelter.
[23:14.49]Oh, dear.
[23:16.97]Okay, so this is gonna get it in the right spot.
[23:22.90]This is fucking moronic.
[23:27.58]Alright, I did it.
[23:28.88]No, I gotta stuff the turkey with stuffing.
[23:33.17]Nice job.
[23:33.73]Alright, now bring in the bed.
[23:36.69]Good job.
[23:38.39]Select two skills from the list.
[23:39.73]Okay, they want more health, more hydration.
[23:42.25]And more health.
[23:44.13]Got it.
[23:46.29]I need a drink.
[23:52.54]Drink that.
[23:54.28]And then get in there.
[23:58.64]Nice level up.
[23:59.50]I get to pick two out of three skills.
[24:04.44]What am I crawling out of?
[24:06.06]Now we're ready.
[24:08.22]I got full hydration.
[24:09.40]Sleeping makes you cure all hunger and illness apparently.
[24:12.38]Go skydiving.
[24:14.36]Go free fall somewhere.
[24:16.70]Do tricks in the air.
[24:21.91]Where would you have me do that?
[24:24.05]Go do tricks?
[24:31.61]Is this a free fall?
[24:33.09]How do I do like a free fall trick?
[24:42.05]This is so dark.
[24:43.11]I need to go turn the fucking brightness up.
[24:44.79]It's actually hard to see.
[24:46.95]Break into somebody's house?
[24:51.75]Oh, there's the plane.
[24:52.55]Alright, the game's about to get interesting.
[24:54.16]We're about to get in the skydive out of the plane.
[24:58.42]This is the darkest fucking game I've ever played in my life.
[25:03.50]Skate 3.
[25:03.86]Alright, let's head down here.
[25:10.07]Follow the Fable 2 breadcrumb trails because I'm a moron.
[25:15.37]Do I, like, need these?
[25:16.26]I don't even care.
[25:17.10]Who cares about, like, anything?
[25:18.10]They're, like, leveling up in this game.
[25:19.22]Let's go skydive.
[25:24.02]So I have to dive out of this plane and do tricks in the air.
[25:32.95]What?! !
[25:34.40]Remember tricks.
[25:36.02]Welcome to the skydive challenge.
[25:37.47]Here you'll need to learn the various aerial tricks to add to your adventure.
[25:42.39]Earn bonus SP by combining moves.
[25:44.49]The more moves you chain together correctly, the more SP you earn.
[25:47.81]Watch for the moves and then pull your tricks in that order.
[25:50.21]Create as many... What the fuck?
[25:51.35]This is not about... I'm not surviving.
[25:56.21]This is not survival.
[25:57.26]This is like having fun.
[25:58.24]I told you this is just an old person's bucket list.
[26:00.66]Go.
[26:00.86]What do I mean go?
[26:08.30]What am I missing?
[26:14.79]Uh... Alright, I hit another one.
[26:17.91]Alright, then we gotta do this trick.
[26:23.36]Yeah, remember, survive in the wild, everybody.
[26:26.58]Remember tricks!
[26:28.36]Ooh, you spread around in a circle!
[26:30.88]Remember these tricks!
[26:33.54]What was the other one?
[26:34.00]Circle?
[26:35.04]Oh, look, I spun around in a circle.
[26:36.38]That's great.
[26:37.86]Circle, square, X. When does this end?
[26:44.57]Oh, there it is.
[26:45.29]It ends.
[26:50.23]I did it.
[26:53.46]Congratulations, you made it through base camp.
[26:54.96]Now scale the rock face to be extracted to your next mission.
[27:02.32]Okay, uh...
[27:06.54]That was a pretty, that was pretty awful.
[27:08.32]Alright, let's keep going.
[27:09.24]Is this the extraction point?
[27:12.73]What is this?
[27:14.09]Animals sighted.
[27:14.69]It's always good to be on the lookout for things to eat and clean water to drink.
[27:18.87]And remember, dead logs often home to some great bugs.
[27:22.13]Am I like trying to pick up bugs?
[27:25.22]Move hand and grab bugs.
[27:28.42]This is fucking impossible, by the way.
[27:30.04]Alright, I got one.
[27:34.01]Wasn't there a Timon and Pumbaa Lion King video game where you did this, and that was it?
[27:42.98]Poisonous millipedes.
[27:52.18]You actually are eating them.
[27:56.82]Let's scale the rock face.
[28:01.96]Okay, there's poisonous bugs.
[28:04.02]Don't eat the poisonous one.
[28:07.04]Scale the rocket and we go to the first real mission.
[28:12.16]Start climbing, buddy.
[28:17.34]We're about to start the real game.
[28:23.53]Thank you, Captain for the bits.
[28:24.79]Thank you, Tub Tucker for the bits.
[28:26.65]Please don't hurt the snake.

[29:01.21]Here we go.
[29:01.55]Here's the... Episode 1.
[29:02.35]What?
[29:02.49]Is that true?
[29:03.23]I just have a fucking crew of cameramen who all need to eat.
[29:05.15]Let's talk about this for a second.
[29:29.54]So he jumps out of planes and shit, but he gets filmed.
[29:33.52]He's not like covered in cameras.
[29:35.62]He has like a camera crew that film him.
[29:38.15]They don't survive.
[29:39.37]The camera crew probably get fucking catered.
[29:42.05]There's like nine people.
[29:43.11]There's like two audio guys, like four cameramen, like a director.
[29:47.25]They just walk around with this guy and like eat sandwiches in front of him while he like pees his pants?
[29:51.22]How does that work?
[29:54.34]Explore this massive mountain range in North America.
[29:56.32]Survive this hostile, rocky environment and make it to the extraction point alive.
[30:00.87]Get to the river, locate animals of interest, locate rare plants, and get your bearings first.
[30:04.03]Get your bearings.
[30:09.37]Oh, gotta do tricks!
[30:10.27]Alright, should we try to get him to break his back?
[30:23.14]I have to be careful.
[30:24.42]I'll break my back doing fun tricks for the kids.
[30:32.34]I'm radical, man.
[30:35.02]I didn't miss.
[30:38.68]You want me to try to break his back?
[30:40.50]Let's try to get his back broken.
[30:42.03]I mean, this is the first chance we're gonna get, you know what I mean?
[30:47.65]What the fuck was that?
[30:52.08]Hold on, is this like a death cutscene?
[31:01.18]No, it's just, you can't fail.
[31:03.17]There's no failing.
[31:05.67]Alright, go look for a river.
[31:08.05]I need to grab some rope.
[31:08.69]Okay.
[31:08.79]Grab some rope.
[31:09.21]Obtained rope.
[31:21.16]You can't combine it with anything.
[31:23.42]Let's go.
[31:23.74]Let's go survive, man.
[31:32.03]Okay.
[31:34.55]Should I go to the menu and turn the brightness up?
[31:37.03]Because this is fucking unbearable.
[31:38.41]Is there a shovel?
[31:41.85]Found a mining shovel.
[31:46.64]Come on.
[31:46.92]The camera crew is very obviously placing interesting things for me to pick up at this point.
[31:52.04]Alright, like, slide down this.
[32:00.24]What happened?
[32:00.68]What the fuck was that?
[32:04.02]Did I just die?
[32:05.68]I think I died.
[32:06.32]Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's, like, you died, but we're not gonna, like, put in an animation.
[32:17.46]I love how I'm supposed to survive in the wild, yet there's these giant...
[32:25.80]You can't lose in this game.
[32:27.06]There's no losing.
[32:28.80]There's no reason.
[32:29.86]This is a game for, like, fans of the show.
[32:32.18]There's no real danger.
[32:33.44]You just go right back to where you were.
[32:37.54]I need to survive or I'm gonna die.
[32:39.12]Well, I've died twice.
[32:41.15]So... Apparently, it's just get to the end.
[32:44.41]I gotta find the river.
[32:51.05]Once I find the river, that's where I'm gonna survive.
[32:58.22]Do you have a certain amount of lives?
[32:59.44]I don't think so.
[33:06.92]No, no, no, no.
[33:07.42]Don't go back down.
[33:08.22]Get back up there.
[33:11.78]Okay, so I gotta go, like, over here.
[33:17.61]What a fucking dumb game.
[33:27.48]It's all these scripted events that are just in a line.
[33:32.00]Some animal's going to come out and I'm going to have to do the terrible cook time event thing.
[33:36.98]And then we're going to just rinse and repeat.
[33:45.49]Do I have to jump to that?
[33:50.05]Apparently so.
[33:50.89]Alright, keep going.
[33:53.65]What am I going to drink?
[33:54.38]Piss?
[33:57.98]Do you actually have to drink piss?
[34:04.62]I need to climb to the top of the mountain.
[34:06.00]What's over here?
[34:07.14]A snake!
[34:07.82]Whoa, easy.
[34:13.83]Do you fight anything else in this game besides snakes?
[34:15.97]Oh, fuck.
[34:16.39]I missed the attack opportunity.
[34:17.51]Alright, I gotta kill him.
[34:25.73]Alright, I got this.
[34:26.97]Let me drink some liquids.
[34:30.68]Can I tie, like, a rope to this?
[34:33.70]No.
[34:34.34]I can cook it eventually.
[34:35.24]Oh, God.
[34:36.24]Oh, God.
[34:38.68]Shelter, right?
[34:40.46]No, millipedes.
[34:41.39]This is a millipede minigame.
[34:45.91]I wonder how hard this game actually is to, like, beat it.
[34:50.11]Don't touch the red ones.
[34:51.09]The red ones are poisonous.
[34:57.16]It's very awkward to move this cursor around, by the way.
[35:10.00]Dude, imagine being such a huge fan of this show, that this is like... I love this.
[35:17.24]I remember when Bear ate those millipedes on that one show, and I remember watching that one episode.
[35:28.18]Licensed video games?
[35:30.13]I never really understood them.
[35:33.00]Because they're all so bad, right?
[35:34.52]Like, I can't... Besides, like, obviously, a couple of, like, the Lord of the Rings games.
[35:38.70]Some of the Star Wars games.
[35:41.52]Oh, shit.
[35:42.10]Okay.
[35:45.28]Licensed video games are always so awful.
[35:47.26]It, like, makes you wonder.
[35:52.95]Until now.
[35:54.88]This game is tedious.
[35:56.28]I did... Come on, what is this?
[35:58.28]Fucking Uncharted 4 Drake's Deception.
[36:00.76]That was like the cover of that fucking game.
[36:02.68]That was like the thumbnail for like every Drake's Deception video you've ever seen.
[36:05.86]Alright, this is the way I gotta go.
[36:14.55]SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom.
[36:20.23]Man, I'm so thirsty.
[36:22.19]Oh, hold on.
[36:22.91]I can take care of that.
[36:27.11]Just chug the whole thing.
[36:29.25]If you guys are wondering, here's some survival tips.
[36:33.80]If you ever are in the wild and you got a canteen... Oh shit, I only got one canteen with 16 ounces of water.
[36:41.92]When you're not even that thirsty, just chug it.
[36:44.84]Just make sure you have enough fluids in you.
[36:46.44]Slam the whole bottle.
[36:50.24]And then sprint everywhere you go.
[36:54.29]What happened over there?
[36:55.23]I already have enough millipedes.
[36:58.36]Don't fucking tell me how many homilipedes I have.
[37:02.14]It's never enough.
[37:05.44]I need to find the Vista point.
[37:08.60]You mean like down... Where are you pointing?
[37:12.38]What the fuck is that?
[37:13.27]Is that goats?
[37:16.67]I love how he's pointing.
[37:21.55]How do you know this, bear?
[37:23.13]You don't know this.
[37:25.61]What, have you been here before?
[37:28.44]The view is beautiful, but I've got to stay focused.
[37:31.98]Every minute matters, and especially when the sun's getting ready to set.
[37:35.54]Oh my god.
[37:36.76]Get your bearings.
[37:38.52]Rocky Mountain Survival.
[37:41.08]Oh boy.
[37:43.12]Get off the mountain.
[37:43.80]I just got up here.
[37:49.95]Why would I climb all the way up here to climb down?
[37:54.13]That's not a good survival tip.
[37:57.82]Yeah, so what you need to do is when you find a place to climb, climb the whole fucking mountain.
[38:06.17]And then climb all the way down.
[38:12.85]Why?
[38:13.19]I need to find the scree hill.
[38:21.34]What?
[38:21.52]I don't understand this.
[38:22.34]Like, I can't climb down that?
[38:28.61]He wants me to climb down the fucking mountain.
[38:37.50]Just fucking jump.
[38:39.74]Go!
[38:40.24]Do it!
[38:42.20]He won't do it.
[38:49.92]The blind streamer, what are you talking about?
[38:52.28]Do I need to jump?
[38:59.28]Like, I can see that, but I can't climb down this.
[39:03.93]Apparently that's not the right way.
[39:05.21]I need to find the scree hill.
[39:13.14]No, I didn't mean to drink that.
[39:24.51]I can't, like, go over here.
[39:27.71]Come on!
[39:28.05]What the fuck is this, like, scree shit?
[39:33.05]Use it!
[39:33.83]I can't use the rope?
[39:40.96]It's trying to say, go back down the mountain.
[39:46.46]I'm gonna starve to death.
[39:50.98]Like, is... Is this it?
[40:01.33]I just gotta ride the way, like, okay, this is, this is like, I don't understand this.
[40:06.93]How am I dumb?
[40:10.71]I need to find the, what is a fucking scree hill?
[40:13.99]What the fuck is this?
[40:19.41]What?
[40:24.06]It wasn't the same way I got up.
[40:27.90]Level up.
[40:28.48]Okay, improve my elemental and fucking physical resistance.
[40:32.95]Are we sliding down or are we jumping this way?
[40:38.83]This way looks a little easier.
[40:40.31]This game is fucking stupid.
[40:51.76]Nobody can do this, by the way.
[40:53.02]You would tumble down this hill and break all your bones.
[40:57.91]What are those shoes?
[40:58.61]Remember those shoes that everybody had that you could, like, pull the skates out?
[41:04.05]What are they called?
[41:04.91]Wheelies?
[41:05.89]Grinders?
[41:07.56]Water, right?
[41:08.40]Yeah, fill the canteen.
[41:13.12]Let's just... Let's chug it.
[41:14.02]Remember, like, that's a very important tip.
[41:17.12]You chug the whole canteen.
[41:21.96]Next game?
[41:22.50]No, not yet.
[41:23.34]Not yet.
[41:24.73]We're not... There's potential here.
[41:27.70]I want to see the end.
[41:30.02]Oh, I don't want to see... No, no, no.
[41:30.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[41:31.56]Hold on.
[41:32.38]I don't want to see the end of this game.
[41:34.98]I just want to see, like, what's potentially next.
[41:37.24]And now I can't get out of the fucking river.
[41:41.85]Oh, God.
[41:43.15]Get me out of the river.
[41:44.19]Okay.
[41:47.77]This game's a masterpiece.
[41:50.27]Oh, you stupid motherfucker.
[41:51.83]Like, I... Really?
[41:53.63]Really?
[41:57.37]Here we go.
[41:58.93]Get off the mountain.
[42:03.07]Found big horned ram.
[42:04.35]Where, where?
[42:04.83]Okay.
[42:05.01]Thanks for the, thanks for the lesson.
[42:06.95]Goats have horns.
[42:07.85]Also, other goats have horns.
[42:08.73]Please return me to GameStop.
[42:27.89]I didn't even buy this at GameStop.
[42:29.09]You can't even, like, buy this game anywhere.
[42:35.44]What is this?
[42:35.92]A pile of shit?
[42:38.90]Dig?
[42:41.58]I'm digging through, like, dinosaur shit.
[42:46.35]There's nothing in there.
[42:47.31]What is the point of that?
[42:48.37]Did I just, like, bury my food?
[42:53.55]That was, like, somebody's hand.
[42:54.71]I'm, like, taking somebody's fingers.
[42:58.27]That was like an undead hand.
[43:02.17]Okay.
[43:09.52]What do I do?
[43:10.18]A punching?
[43:10.70]Would I have to punch the rock?
[43:12.28]Would I have to karate chop the rock?
[43:15.78]I should pick up a hammer and... Let me pick up a hammer.
[43:22.31]That paracord will come in handy now.
[43:24.59]I can use some shards from the stone to make a zipline.
[43:27.36]I can shard on the zipline.
[43:33.02]What the fuck does this want me to do?
[43:37.74]Break rock.
[43:38.38]Wait, what is this?
[43:38.84]Okay, break the rock.
[43:44.57]That's some breakneck strength.
[43:47.47]To be able to smash a rock in your hand like that.
[43:49.29]Okay, I have a sharp shard.
[43:55.62]Okay, now I need a tree that I can climb.
[43:58.72]Alright, I can climb up a tree.
[44:02.99]Sorry about here.
[44:03.57]They don't make it very hard.
[44:04.81]I'm gonna climb this... I didn't even get a chance to ask if I wanted to.
[44:11.95]He's just gone.
[44:16.80]What?
[44:17.46]Nobody does it.
[44:19.68]Bear Grylls, I know that you're really cool and everything, but what in the name of God am I doing?
[44:27.75]What is this for?
[44:28.75]I have to swing this around.
[44:37.38]Okay.
[44:37.52]Okay.
[44:45.41]This is awkward as all hell.
[44:52.11]Who does this?
[44:52.71]This is not how you like survive in the wild.
[44:54.43]This is so hard.
[44:56.91]This is not... You don't climb up a tree as fucking Spider-Man and like... Oh my god, this is hard.
[45:08.53]It's just all over the place and I didn't even get it.
[45:11.51]How...
[45:14.30]Let's give it another go.
[45:17.43]Fucking lord.
[45:20.79]You see how quickly that fucking happens?
[45:28.53]This is so fucking hard.
[45:30.31]Let's give it another go.
[45:32.55]Just fucking walk over there.
[45:34.45]Why do you have to grappling hook it?
[45:37.19]Oh my god, finally.
[45:41.82]Oh, perfect throw, dude.
[45:46.34]How to survive in the wild?
[45:47.28]Just be Spider-Man.
[45:48.32]Yeah, I could have just climbed... I could have walked there.
[45:51.20]There's a snake.
[45:54.00]Did I lose the rope?
[45:59.20]I think I have enough food.
[46:01.04]It's gonna tell me, you already have a snake.
[46:03.30]Killing that animal would be a waste of time.
[46:07.49]I know, I have enough meat.
[46:08.27]Like, I want to cook something.
[46:09.29]I'm hungry.
[46:13.77]Okay, well, I can't eat.
[46:15.27]It won't let me.
[46:18.92]I'll just have to skate down.
[46:19.98]Found an elk.
[46:24.84]Let's build a fire.
[46:25.28]I need some sticks and pin needles.
[46:26.22]I need water.
[46:43.30]Oh, man.
[46:44.04]Guys, this is... You have all the items for the... I want to make food.
[46:48.78]Oh, that's how... I don't need to... Just make the fire and then cook the food.
[46:53.16]What am I, stupid?
[46:53.89]I remember how to do this.
[46:56.63]You bring everything over here.
[47:00.23]Start the fire.
[47:00.95]Put my face in it.
[47:03.57]Blow on it.
[47:04.11]And then blow.
[47:08.80]Blow.
[47:14.22]It's getting dark.
[47:14.76]Some animals come up.
[47:17.43]My face is actually in the fucking fire.
[47:20.83]No shit!
[47:21.97]Oh my god, it gave me like a fucking prompt!
[47:27.69]I had like a triangle prompt on the screen and it was step on the fire.
[47:30.22]Now I gotta do it again.
[47:31.00]Okay, cook the raw meat please.
[47:44.31]Cook this.
[47:46.01]Don't make sure it's... Just like roasting a marshmallow.
[47:50.04]This is the technique of roasting a marshmallow.
[47:52.04]Done.
[47:53.82]See?
[47:56.50]One more.
[47:56.74]We gotta cook the worms now, right?
[48:01.04]Am I pissing?
[48:05.43]What?
[48:05.93]Did I just piss on the fire?
[48:08.93]What happened?
[48:12.01]No, don't eat the bugs.
[48:16.59]I need to drink fucking food.
[48:17.87]Alright, I'm like tired.
[48:21.41]How do I cook these?
[48:22.31]No, stop eating bugs!
[48:29.64]Alright, there's my fire.
[48:32.20]Build a shelter.
[48:34.70]I need some moss, I need some more needles and shit.
[48:36.48]Drink some food.
[48:36.80]Shut up.
[48:37.00]Oh, oh, shut up.
[48:37.40]Oh no, it's cold.
[48:55.05]Wait, wait, wait, what's going on?
[48:57.45]There's bees?
[48:58.19]Wait, hold on a second.
[48:58.83]Did I just get stung?
[48:59.43]How many more sticks do I need?
[49:01.19]Oh, shit.
[49:01.73]What is this?
[49:02.87]Build a trap?
[49:03.33]What is this?
[49:03.65]What?
[49:03.75]What is going on?
[49:30.37]I'm, like, making a slingshot?
[49:31.89]Fuck!
[49:36.45]Trap.
[49:41.16]Find the correct height?
[49:52.24]Where is the correct height?
[49:55.70]I ju- there- is there- is there a correct height here?
[50:00.27]Right there!
[50:02.67]Right... Right here!
[50:05.06]Right there!
[50:06.40]Right there!
[50:07.86]It's right there!
[50:09.10]Hold it... I... I... Okay.
[50:18.98]I don't... Hold the rock at the correct height.
[50:29.33]Is that mean it's in the right spot?
[50:30.99]What the fuck is happening?
[50:36.39]Oh shit, I'm gonna die.
[50:37.13]Man, I'm so thirsty.
[50:38.40]Go, go, wait, wait, wait, come here, come here.
[50:40.90]Quick, quickly, quickly, I'm freezing to death, come on.
[50:45.06]Come on, stay next to the fire.
[50:45.96]Alright, I'm warm.
[50:51.82]I've eaten, I'm nice and warm.
[50:57.82]It's so dark I can't even tell where the shelter portion is.
[51:01.86]Here's a couple more sticks.
[51:07.67]I don't care about bugs.
[51:09.25]Let's make a shelter so I can be done with this already.
[51:12.41]Build the shelter.
[51:13.09]Okay.
[51:13.55]Drag over the bones.
[51:17.18]Hurry up.
[51:18.86]This is just patting my belly and scratching my head at the same time.
[51:21.08]Get over here.
[51:24.40]Oh my lord.
[51:25.64]Okay, now bring it in quick before I freeze to death.
[51:27.82]Come on.
[51:35.02]Come on.
[51:35.44]Alright, sleep.
[51:36.96]Go to bed.
[51:38.67]Wake up in the morning and remember, if you're dying, you just go to sleep and you wake up and everything's fine.
[51:45.07]What is that?
[51:48.67]Wait, wait, what?
[51:50.09]What are you talking about?
[51:51.47]Wait, what are you doing?
[51:52.83]Like, backflip?
[52:06.58]Did I... Did I lose the game?
[52:09.05]Oh, thank God it saved.
[52:14.79]Oh, God damn it.
[52:15.79]Okay, at least... Never seen him do that in the show.
[52:17.49]I'm just in... I'm just in capacity.
[52:19.29]What a stupid fucking game.
[52:32.99]You know, I bet you Bear Grylls was in, like, he was in like the programming room, he was checking in, you know, he made a trip to the studio that's making this game.
[52:42.01]And, uh, he got there, went behind the guy's desk that was making a certain, like, portion of the game, like this part.
[52:50.34]And he's like, you know, like, how do you like this bear?
[52:52.76]And he's like, it's him dodging and shit and moving back and forth.
[52:56.16]He probably demanded to have the backflip put in there.
[52:58.69]I would.
[53:00.03]Wouldn't you?
[53:03.00]I would fucking demand that I do something fucking crazy.
[53:05.45]Okay, this is my trap.
[53:07.99]Stand next to the fire.
[53:11.81]Alright, I've eaten.
[53:12.57]I need a drink.
[53:15.83]Should I... Why can I not put the fire next to the shelter?
[53:18.79]Doesn't that make no sense?
[53:21.75]What else do I need?
[53:22.27]I need one more stick and one more moss.
[53:27.92]Easy.
[53:32.68]The moss is right here.
[53:33.50]I have to go over here and do this.
[53:37.42]Did I get it?
[53:37.88]I think I got the honey.
[53:39.24]I'm pretty sure I got the honey.
[53:40.28]If I didn't, then that's too bad.
[54:01.19]Yeah, I love how I'm mildly irritated by that.
[54:03.23]Wait, hold on, what is... Come down, come on.
[54:08.39]Right there.
[54:08.73]Alright, now let's not die from the bear.
[54:17.33]Here we go.
[54:21.72]Did this time gotta get the dodges correct?
[54:29.51]Give me a break.
[54:31.01]What?
[54:32.67]Wait, that's all I had to do?
[54:33.87]What's going on here?
[54:36.03]That's your goal?
[54:36.63]That's your end game?
[54:37.95]It's like, do I can jump over him like a car in an action movie and that's it?
[54:41.33]Get to the river.
[54:42.09]What river?
[54:44.98]What the fuck is happening right now?
[54:46.36]Why do I have to keep doing this?
[54:52.48]Where's my bow and arrow?
[54:53.68]Get to the river.
[54:56.68]What does that even mean?
[54:58.93]What does that even mean?
[54:59.79]Get to the river!
[55:00.53]What the fuck are they talking about?
[55:06.12]Oh.
[55:06.44]My.
[55:06.82]God.
[55:15.80]God, where is the correct way to go?
[55:18.02]First of all... Alright, hold on a second.
[55:27.07]I'm going to turn this up.
[55:30.57]Yes, I know you did.
[55:32.29]Where's the brightness?
[55:34.67]And of course, there is no brightness.
[55:38.63]There's no brightness.
[55:43.08]There is no brightness.
[55:45.24]Why would there be?
[55:45.76]Alright, we're going to continue from the last save.
[55:52.32]Wait, the Everglades.
[55:54.52]I unlocked the Everglades.
[55:58.32]Should I go to the... Alright, we're gonna try this one more time.
[56:00.58]We're loading from that last save point.
[56:10.81]A real survivor adjusts their eyes, not the fucking slider.
[56:22.53]Thank you, uh... Thank you, Motel Trivago.
[56:26.91]Also, Muse, thanks for the bits.
[56:30.51]That face when Tokyo Jungle is the better survival game.
[56:35.56]Circe, thank you, Circe.
[56:37.36]Ten Tones, thank you for the ten bucks.
[56:40.64]Hype for the Critical... Critical... How do you say his name?
[56:43.70]Critical Podcast PS2 B-movie game.
[56:46.04]When?
[56:47.46]I don't know.
[56:52.97]I would do like a podcast with somebody.
[56:55.11]I would be on a cast.
[56:58.58]I don't really know.
[56:59.28]I don't know critical.
[57:02.26]I need to get warm and soon.
[57:06.55]Whatever.
[57:11.27]Fuck.
[57:13.37]Got it.
[57:13.59]I don't even know what these do.
[57:15.99]Why am I setting these?
[57:17.00]The bear just comes after you.
[57:20.00]There's no reason to do any of this.
[57:21.00]The bear just attacks you.
[57:22.12]So let's like look up.
[57:22.96]Let's find where I need to go to get to the river.
[57:27.00]Is it this way?
[57:31.12]It's not this way.
[57:33.54]Which pitch black corner of the map is it?
[57:36.60]Do I have to run to the beehive?
[57:40.10]I need to get warm and soon.
[57:41.58]Oh, please.
[57:42.67]How do I get out of here?
[57:45.23]That beehive will have honey.
[57:47.03]And if there's one thing we bears love, it's honey.
[57:50.07]Can you guys see anything?
[57:52.91]I'll need to find a way to smoke out.
[57:54.65]I can't even find my way back.
[57:55.87]Okay, let's go over here.
[58:00.32]Holy shit.
[58:01.76]Okay, how much, what do I need?
[58:02.62]Alright, let's get warm.
[58:07.46]Yeah, that's fine.
[58:08.31]I just, I think I have to go that way.
[58:10.67]I have no idea, man.
[58:11.97]It's just gonna be a wild guess.
[58:13.13]I just have to pray that I get it alright.
[58:30.92]Get the honey for the grizzly bear.
[58:33.30]Just give it to him.
[58:33.96]Get it.
[58:35.36]Got it.
[58:35.54]Did I get it?
[58:36.36]One large log and then some more moss.
[58:39.52]There's a large log.
[58:40.50]Okay, here we go.
[59:00.56]No, we're not nexting this.
[59:01.68]I'm not nexting this yet.
[59:02.73]There's too much potential to see interesting things in this dumb game.
[59:07.73]I'm going to get through this part.
[59:10.35]And then we're going to move on to the next area.
[59:12.99]Because this is going to be it.
[59:13.83]Remember the last time we prematurely nexted?
[59:24.42]You bet.
[59:24.88]Let me just smoke out the bees.
[59:32.86]Okay, here we go.
[59:33.52]I need to run somewhere, and I don't know where that is.
[59:38.96]Oh, come on.
[59:40.04]No!
[59:51.85]I'm Bear Grylls.
[59:53.02]I serve with the British Special Forces.
[59:55.00]Climb.
[60:01.20]Fuck that place.
[60:02.30]That place was black.
[60:03.56]I'm done with it.
[60:20.27]My challenge is to survive the alligator-infested swamps of the Everglades.
[60:24.52]Alligator.
[60:24.90]I'm going to show you the skills needed to survive here.
[60:28.14]Okay, can you please give me an area that's not, like, just pitch black?
[60:33.50]Find civilization.
[60:35.99]Explore encamp in the swamp, explore the sawgrass in the forest, and find civilization.
[60:39.63]You got it.
[60:42.17]Am I going to skip myself like a rock?
[60:45.37]You're dead.
[60:45.89]Bear Grylls is dead.
[60:47.10]That's it.
[60:47.56]He's gone.
[60:48.12]Like, the end of the game.
[60:48.90]Game over.
[60:53.11]What is going on?
[60:58.17]Why would I jump out here?
[61:01.57]Why would I do this?
[61:02.63]Why would I do that?
[61:03.59]Why wouldn't I just wait?
[61:04.43]Why would I wait till the plane was done?
[61:06.01]Go to the beach.
[61:12.98]Okay, well, hold on.
[61:14.50]Here's your alligator.
[61:16.62]Does this instantly kill you?
[61:24.12]Yes, it does.
[61:26.38]I'm just sitting there like, just sitting in the water.
[61:28.28]Okay, it instantly kills you.
[61:33.19]There's no dodging, there's no backflips.
[61:36.17]Okay, we have to go this way.
[61:42.07]Let's go.
[61:42.71]Now I'm wet.
[61:44.17]I'm all wet.
[61:46.04]And that really stinks.
[61:47.26]I actually have to swim by them.
[61:50.71]At least I can see.
[61:51.45]Alright, I gotta go that way.
[61:52.45]So let's go.
[61:52.93]Is there a swim faster button?
[61:59.48]I don't think so.
[62:00.08]Rubbish.
[62:00.38]There's too much rubbish in here apparently.
[62:02.26]Alright, let's go.
[62:03.04]Just sneak by the alligators.
[62:18.00]Buy the gator.
[62:19.52]Play as one of these alligators.
[62:21.46]Alright, we're good.
[62:25.00]And here we go.
[62:26.18]Made it.
[62:27.42]Pick up this skunk.
[62:33.43]Why did that need a cutscene?
[62:35.15]Okay, can't drink this water.
[62:38.03]This water's poisonous, right?
[62:41.67]Don't drink the poison water.
[62:45.39]Here's the speedrun strat.
[62:46.29]I don't have to do the swimming animation.
[62:51.34]Climb up here.
[62:51.90]I think I can jump into the water from here.
[62:56.00]Yep, okay.
[62:56.36]I guess I can.
[62:57.76]Into the swamp.
[62:58.34]I need a stick.
[62:58.80]Get a cat.
[63:00.16]Alright, let's get a stick from the ground.
[63:15.53]I need a stick.
[63:16.23]I don't have any sticks.
[63:19.05]Wait, can I just use this?
[63:20.39]No.
[63:25.31]Go fishing.
[63:26.13]With what?
[63:28.22]Just grab them with my hands?
[63:33.96]Now I'll need to get a fire going if I want to cook this catfish.
[63:37.00]Some saltwater fish are poisonous, but freshwater fish are all edible.
[63:41.27]They're a good source of protein, vitamins, and fats.
[63:44.83]Oh, shit.
[63:45.33]That's okay.
[63:45.69]I can fill it.
[63:46.09]Can I fill it again?
[63:50.87]Fill it again.
[63:54.23]God damn it.
[63:55.13]Oh, well.
[63:55.39]Alright, uh, Scarlet Kingsnake.
[63:58.77]Uh-oh.
[63:59.23]So which one is that?
[64:00.51]That's yellow.
[64:00.87]Stomp on him.
[64:12.78]No, okay, well I found the stick I was gonna use.
[64:15.75]So this is poisonous.
[64:17.39]So I just stab him in the head, finish him, and then eat the poisonous snake.
[64:25.79]Alright, we got our Dr. Seuss snake.
[64:28.78]Good.
[64:32.36]Anything else I need to do there?
[64:33.98]No.
[64:37.45]This way.
[64:41.32]Red and yellow is a friendly fellow.
[64:45.54]Red on black.
[64:47.74]You don't know Jack.
[64:50.60]Green on blue.
[64:51.28]You'll be dead soon.
[64:54.98]Oh, goddammit.
[64:58.18]Is this an instant kill?
[65:04.81]Hopefully this will do it.
[65:06.11]I'm up in the water, so he's on my territory.
[65:07.99]Oh!
[65:08.19]Climb.
[65:08.33]What?
[65:08.45]Nobody can do this.
[65:09.17]Not even a cat can do this.
[65:34.32]Okay.
[65:35.38]I'm gonna go that... No, which way?
[65:36.48]That way?
[65:38.90]Over there.
[65:39.69]Alright, you got it.
[65:40.21]Are you serious?
[65:53.48]Kill it.
[65:54.86]Kill it!
[65:57.00]Right in the eye!
[65:58.82]Oh, dear.
[65:59.60]What?
[66:00.76]What happened?
[66:01.96]Did he eat my...
[66:04.68]Oh.
[66:06.44]Well, I have enough meat, apparently.
[66:07.94]Okay, well, that was fun.
[66:14.36]This place is really funny.
[66:16.54]There could be alligators anywhere.
[66:18.52]And the last thing you want to do is surprise one.
[66:22.26]Okay, they're like fucking they're like they're like fucking scary animals inside the trees Yeah, I'll just reach my hand up there and just put it in like a fucking game show A box tortoise
[66:49.80]Okay, interact.
[66:52.04]Get some poison.
[66:53.94]Eat some millipedes.
[66:55.26]Not the red ones.
[67:00.65]How do you dry yourself off in this game?
[67:02.39]Do I have to roll around in the dirt?
[67:03.89]Or how does that work?
[67:09.78]Alright, we're good.
[67:13.72]It's about to get dark.
[67:17.69]Now I got like turned around.
[67:18.59]I'll investigate again.
[67:19.81]I wonder what's gonna be in here.
[67:23.29]Yeah!
[67:24.58]No, what?
[67:27.30]Attack what?
[67:30.00]What was that?
[67:31.18]What the fuck was that?
[67:34.44]What was I attacking?
[67:35.36]I just like threw it behind me.
[67:40.72]What was in that tree?
[67:45.64]What?
[67:49.14]I just, like, pulled out a shoe and threw it behind me.
[67:56.71]Any more, like, trees I can reach my hand into?
[68:02.25]That was a... Okay, hold on.
[68:03.95]Let's get this right here.
[68:04.71]Investigate.
[68:07.29]Jump.
[68:08.99]What is this?
[68:09.91]Why are there bees here?
[68:10.89]That doesn't make any sense.
[68:14.09]Alright, let's break my, uh...
[68:19.54]Fill this up again.
[68:20.32]I'm still surrounded by bees.
[68:26.68]I'm just getting stung.
[68:27.54]Where's my life?
[68:28.66]Oh, it's okay.
[68:29.16]I'm alright.
[68:30.30]There's a fucking alligator now.
[68:31.52]I'm surrounded by bees and alligators.
[68:33.88]The bees are, like, attacking me.
[68:36.12]Okay, stung.
[68:38.56]I actually am getting stung.
[68:40.84]What was that?
[68:45.18]This is fucking stupid.
[68:46.99]Get away from me.
[68:54.38]They won't leave me alone I don't have to go in the water or something.
[69:01.95]No, then there's never gonna leave Thank God I need more
[69:20.36]Those are mosquitoes?
[69:22.44]Those aren't bees.
[69:24.80]Alright, so I don't remember mosquitoes swarming like this.
[69:31.44]Oh my god.
[69:32.44]Seriously.
[69:33.88]I got... Let's go.
[69:35.18]Go.
[69:38.96]You have all the items for... Did I just capture a fucking mosquito?
[69:46.31]They're making this very difficult for me.
[69:52.65]Start the fire.
[69:57.55]Get the fuck away from me.
[70:00.07]Will they burn from this?
[70:09.26]Okay, it's lit.
[70:11.06]Now they're gone.
[70:12.70]Alright, level up.
[70:14.88]Unlock to do fire technique.
[70:16.31]More health and more energy.
[70:17.73]Hydration is fucking useless.
[70:19.09]Doesn't even do anything.
[70:20.97]Let's cook some meat.
[70:24.66]Cook.
[70:26.10]Alright, let's get this piece of bologna, like, nice and medium.
[70:30.62]Medium.
[70:32.74]That was what I... That's what I consider, like, fucking real medium.
[70:35.95]And by the way, I don't even eat medium.
[70:38.23]No shit, I shouldn't have eaten this.
[70:42.33]I do like a medium well.
[70:44.69]Don't judge me.
[70:45.33]Alright, that's good.
[70:47.11]I don't need to eat anymore.
[70:49.89]I got plenty of bugs.
[70:54.46]I don't like, like, rare, like, hamburgers or steak.
[70:57.38]I don't even like steak.
[70:59.26]Oh, shit.
[70:59.66]Did I just say that?
[71:00.26]I shouldn't have said that out loud.
[71:02.40]Somebody's gonna be really mad about that.
[71:04.84]I don't eat a whole lot of red meat.
[71:07.90]I don't.
[71:11.14]Medium, like, medium.
[71:12.36]No, I don't like red meat.
[71:13.42]I don't eat red meat.
[71:14.82]I do.
[71:15.26]I eat, like, hamburgers.
[71:16.11]I eat hamburgers, meatballs, and, like, corned beef.
[71:22.07]I don't really like anything else.
[71:26.81]Alright, that was weird.
[71:30.65]Um... Now what?
[71:34.23]Now where do I go?
[71:37.89]So I eat the shitty bits.
[71:38.91]No, I don't like steak.
[71:43.81]I'm a big poultry fan.
[71:46.29]I like chicken, turkey.
[71:49.32]I like fish.
[71:51.22]You know, bugs.
[71:53.62]Like crickets, cockroaches.
[71:57.18]Um, ants?
[72:01.33]Snake?
[72:02.43]Alright, like, I'm just, like, talking now.
[72:06.39]I'm just walking in circles.
[72:11.27]Here it is, the way to go.
[72:12.21]Okay.
[72:14.10]Tell you, I do not like this stuff at all.
[72:16.50]I just cannot see what's in the water.
[72:19.86]That means I'm gonna get, like, I'm gonna get attacked.
[72:22.16]It's late, and I've gotta get out of the water before nightfall.
[72:28.92]Locate a proper cluster.
[72:30.34]Alright, well let's go.
[72:32.74]Build a shelter.
[72:33.37]Let's do this.
[72:34.85]Moss, large branch, and palmetto leaves.
[72:37.53]Palmetto!
[72:38.29]Like saw palmetto.
[72:40.57]Cool.
[72:41.53]Look, there's a saw palmetto.
[72:44.99]I take saw palmetto.
[72:47.35]Nice.
[72:50.82]This game now connects with me.
[72:56.14]Watch another bear come out of here.
[72:57.70]I would laugh.
[73:00.29]The bear in the swamp.
[73:04.25]Cool.
[73:04.87]Somebody just wrote... Oh my god.
[73:08.88]What?
[73:10.10]That water's not even deep enough to do that.
[73:15.80]That water's not deep enough for that to fucking happen.
[73:19.56]Oh my god.
[73:19.82]Give me a break.
[73:20.31]Okay, we gotta do this fast then.
[73:30.26]Let's go.
[73:30.66]Start the Gator Challenge.
[73:31.74]Start the Building Challenge.
[73:37.58]Saw Palmetto is best known for its use in decreasing symptoms of an enlarged prostate.
[73:41.80]No.
[73:42.10]Yes.
[73:43.22]No.
[73:45.20]Saw Palmetto is really good.
[73:46.58]It's a potential... Listen.
[73:47.79]Listen to me.
[73:49.07]As long as you don't take too much of it.
[73:50.51]You don't take a lot of it.
[73:52.27]Saw Palmetto has potential to block DHT.
[73:55.73]Which is known in a lot of circles and a lot of medical research to be a component of hair loss.
[74:01.61]Not losing my hair yet.
[74:02.94]I don't want to.
[74:03.44]I'm getting old.
[74:05.46]I just take a little bit.
[74:06.64]You know?
[74:09.70]No, no!
[74:13.94]Just to make sure I don't fucking lose my hair!
[74:19.60]I'm not bald yet.
[74:20.60]I'm not even close.
[74:21.89]Don't even step on him!
[74:23.69]Don't even!
[74:30.27]See what's in the water.
[74:31.17]Keep a lookout now for alligators.
[74:35.21]I can't even see.
[74:36.06]Oh my lord.
[74:36.62]Am I going to be able to finish this?
[74:38.16]Did I get here too late?
[74:42.68]Okay.
[74:43.08]Well, let's try to not have... Okay, there's an alligator right there.
[74:47.52]Oh my god.
[74:49.31]What the fuck do they expect you to do?
[74:54.83]And plus it helps with like, you know... So I'll put him at...
[75:02.94]Where even is this guy?
[75:08.58]I don't see them.
[75:09.56]They don't exist.
[75:10.68]They just pretend to exist.
[75:11.63]They're just here somewhere.
[75:18.77]Spanish moss.
[75:19.51]I need one more branch.
[75:23.00]Where is he?
[75:26.22]They're the same texture as the ground, apparently.
[75:33.39]Alright, one more and then moss.
[75:34.91]Where's the last moss?
[75:36.34]And then I can finally get the fuck out of this.
[75:38.06]Is there an alligator right there?
[75:43.26]I don't know.
[75:44.52]I'm just rolling the dice.
[75:47.36]Okay, go.
[75:49.62]Build a swamp bed.
[75:56.77]Actually, this looks kind of cool.
[75:58.05]I would sleep on this.
[75:58.85]I actually probably would sleep on this and be okay with it.
[76:03.87]be kind of relaxing.
[76:04.64]Let's build a fire.
[76:07.80]I'm going to burn this?
[76:12.48]Carve five notches in the same spot.
[76:22.09]What?
[76:23.09]Alternate L and R up and down.
[76:29.55]Why am I burning my shelter?
[76:35.31]Aren't I sleeping on this?
[76:38.79]I'm just making like a big cartoon Looney Tunes barbecue.
[76:41.53]I actually am sleeping on this.
[76:50.08]Why would I sleep in this?
[76:52.74]Isn't that gonna fucking like kill me?
[76:58.48]I guess not.
[76:58.88]Okay.
[77:00.84]Okay.
[77:05.24]Don't roll out of bed.
[77:09.91]Keeps your bum warm.
[77:10.97]Yeah, well, wouldn't it burn the leaves down?
[77:12.75]It would catch on fire and I would wake up engulfed in flames.
[77:17.33]First night in the swamp was not a good one.
[77:20.40]That storm came in and really shook things up.
[77:23.40]But luckily the shelter held up.
[77:26.22]Alright, good.
[77:26.92]Time to get a move on.
[77:27.78]But first, I need water.
[77:30.52]No, I don't.
[77:32.18]My hydration is perfect.
[77:33.82]I don't need any water.
[77:36.58]I don't need any water.
[77:40.82]Alright, what's next?
[77:44.89]Fire's not gonna spread in the swamp?
[77:47.45]You don't know that?
[77:48.07]What?
[77:59.99]Sawgrass holds in the humidity, so it can feel up to 20 degrees hotter than it actually is.
[78:05.77]So I'm just walking through like razor blades?
[78:10.40]Alright, that's interesting.
[78:12.88]Animal sighted, nutria.
[78:15.20]What is a nutria?
[78:21.42]So why wouldn't, why would I put my hands on it then?
[78:24.68]Watch out for the fucking flying turkey sausages.
[78:34.40]Turkey sauce just grow in the fucking Everglades.
[78:37.06]I can't even.
[78:37.83]You know what?
[78:38.25]I was going to do a thing there.
[78:40.45]What?
[78:42.03]Stop the ball in the green bar.
[78:43.37]What are you talking about?
[78:44.07]Oh, this is quicksand.
[78:50.53]I get it.
[78:50.85]Okay.
[78:59.50]I'm not sure there's actually a rhyme or reason to this.
[79:07.94]I guess I'm gaining time?
[79:09.04]I'm not gonna make a dumb joke here, because this actually could be very bad.
[79:13.92]I don't want to do this again.
[79:15.78]Now, how am I swimming in quicksand?
[79:22.39]It doesn't make any sense.
[79:28.23]Oh, boy, this sucks.
[79:33.84]You also don't pull yourself out of quicksand like that, I don't think.
[79:37.14]Isn't quicksand like if you get in, you die?
[79:38.64]Of course.
[79:47.84]Of course this is gonna happen.
[79:53.62]Yep.
[79:55.00]And stab him in the face.
[79:59.60]Alright, like what am I gonna do?
[80:00.50]Break his neck?
[80:07.18]It's not that easy to kill an alligator.
[80:09.10]Do not put forth this notion that that killing an alligator is like just as simple as sticking a knife in his head.
[80:15.74]Do not- don't do that, bear.
[80:16.88]Come on.
[80:20.06]It's not that easy.
[80:23.72]Yeah, that's the- yeah, the gator's dead now.
[80:28.96]Oh, come on.
[80:29.66]I should have just jumped.
[80:30.50]No, I'm just going to jump over it.
[80:35.73]Just jump over it.
[80:37.61]If you knew there was quicksand here, why wouldn't you just jump it?
[80:40.31]Look at how quick, look at how easy this is to jump.
[80:41.97]You know what I mean?
[80:48.33]Come on.
[80:48.83]Oh, it is a rodent.
[80:52.33]Cool.
[80:59.95]Nice, I found a rodent.
[81:02.85]Which one of those is fighting me?
[81:05.29]So I have to fight the giant rodent.
[81:11.02]What the fuck?
[81:14.78]Wait.
[81:17.72]Why would I do?
[81:18.68]Wait, why?
[81:21.18]Why would I do that?
[81:23.04]That was like a fun animal and I just broke his fucking neck.
[81:27.69]I should have let him go!
[81:28.54]I didn't- I thought I was gonna make him beat him!
[81:34.10]Oh my god, get out of here.
[81:38.00]That looked personal.
[81:39.32]Oh, look at these majestic animals.
[81:45.99]I'm gonna pick- I'm gonna grab him and like snuggle him and then break his neck.
[81:52.31]How long am I gonna play this piece of shit game?
[81:54.41]Uh, I don't know.
[81:58.93]I don't know.
[81:59.49]No, not this again.
[82:01.25]Oh, man.
[82:02.59]No, I gotta jump.
[82:09.77]Did you guys see the stack of fucking PS3 games behind me?
[82:14.90]There's a lot to get through.
[82:17.12]But I feel like we gotta give some of these games some time.
[82:21.82]There might be something in them.
[82:23.02]Who knows?
[82:23.48]I might get a gun soon.
[82:33.27]Okay, that doesn't help.
[82:35.41]Rapidly pressing L2 and R2 does not make it better.
[82:41.99]PS3 Marathon?
[82:42.99]No, not necessarily.
[82:43.77]I mean, we're not going to be able to, because I want to play Absolver.
[82:49.63]I at least want to try Absolver for a stream or so.
[82:53.54]See if it's any fun.
[82:56.14]Stalker?
[82:56.58]I want to get back to Stalker too, eventually.
[83:02.19]Alright, so I found a campsite.
[83:10.23]I'm gonna craft a gun.
[83:11.15]Yeah, I'm gonna make like a rubber band gun.
[83:16.03]Pretty sick moon gravity.
[83:23.82]Alright, we gotta see at least one... We gotta see one more area.
[83:30.34]What the f...
[83:36.14]I can't even talk.
[83:37.64]What was the point?
[83:39.40]I broke my legs and now a bear is attacking.
[83:42.36]Can I hide in that?
[83:43.10]If I can hide in that, you're talking about... What the fuck was that?
[83:46.76]Don't kill me, please.
[83:50.10]Just punched the bear in the face.
[83:52.91]Alright, so remember, punch the bear in the mouth to get away from him.
[83:59.51]Got it.
[83:59.75]Did I break the bear's neck?
[84:05.75]That's how you beat a bear.
[84:18.69]You walk over and punch something angrily and he gets scared and runs away.
[84:35.32]Ay-yi-yi.
[84:37.10]Ay-yi-yi.
[84:39.89]There's nothing else to that.
[84:44.31]Yeah, the bear just watched me do that and thought I was crazy.
[84:48.61]Whoa, that guy's weird.
[84:50.41]I'm not gonna mess around with a guy that's weird, you know what I mean?
[84:52.59]I'm not eating him.
[84:54.84]He's strange.
[85:02.95]Uh, am I taking water from the ground here?
[85:04.97]I thought he said, don't drink this.
[85:08.63]Hey, does a bear shit in the woods?
[85:09.74]You know what I mean?
[85:12.66]Isn't that not a good idea?
[85:13.92]Like, that's a bad idea.
[85:15.76]Like, does a bear shit in the woods?
[85:17.38]Of course he does.
[85:17.94]It's a bad idea.
[85:23.38]I need to... I don't know why there's this weird anti-gravity thing going on right now.
[85:29.63]The game feels like it's in slow motion.
[85:33.95]What the hell am I doing?
[85:38.67]We must have seen everything now.
[85:40.13]Not true.
[85:44.91]I don't think that's true.
[85:46.11]I think there's more to it.
[85:47.87]There's at least one more.
[85:48.69]There's probably like a snow level.
[85:50.29]We gotta just check it out.
[85:51.87]Look, I didn't... Look, I didn't buy... You wanna know how much money I spent on these?
[85:57.54]I'm gonna tell you.
[85:58.20]I'm gonna tell you how much money I spent on all these PlayStation 3 games.
[86:07.97]I spent like over $400 on all these games.
[86:11.89]So we're gonna try them We're gonna make we're gonna go do our due diligence and test them and make sure they're fucking good Make sure they're worth playing, you know, cuz we might miss something I bought like 32 games.
[86:24.69]Okay, I want to make sure we had some fucking interesting thing.
[86:27.42]What is that?
[86:29.22]That's bigger than the bear
[86:33.97]Is it?
[86:35.17]That thing is fucking huge.
[86:36.59]Are deer this big?
[86:42.33]Come here.
[86:46.53]Can I like tackle it or do something?
[86:47.99]I don't think I can do anything with this.
[86:50.05]Alright, whatever.
[86:57.55]Excellent.
[86:58.25]We've got everything we need to start a fire.
[87:00.11]Let's go back to where we started and build it there.
[87:03.24]Is there a sneak button?
[87:07.26]I've never seen a deer.
[87:08.32]No, it's not that I've never seen a deer, but man, that one is well fed.
[87:11.42]That deer is well fed, guys.
[87:14.63]You know what I mean?
[87:19.67]Well fed.
[87:20.45]Okay.
[87:25.48]Somebody said that the Sahara level is fun.
[87:28.06]Okay, well, we have to see it.
[87:30.44]I didn't spend $400 on this game to not see the Sahara.
[87:33.26]You know what I mean?
[87:41.28]There's a couple of these in particular that I can't wait to play.
[87:44.86]And I'd love to tell you what they are.
[87:46.32]Apparently it didn't do so well.
[88:01.73]What's going on?
[88:05.79]Do it, man.
[88:06.21]Alright.
[88:08.91]Put your face in it.
[88:09.49]350 degrees.
[88:12.83]That says the law.
[88:14.25]And then you're going to put the salmon in there for 12 minutes.
[88:17.85]Make sure now.
[88:18.29]425 degrees for 7 minutes.
[88:18.89]And turn it down to 375 for like another 6 minutes.
[88:20.73]Perfect.
[88:20.91]Let's cook some of the meat we got.
[88:30.17]Okay.
[88:31.29]Go.
[88:34.05]And just like that, a consistent golden brown.
[88:37.31]Absolutely delicious.
[88:38.13]Let's drink our canteen a little bit here.
[88:44.01]Alright.
[88:48.55]Now we can go.
[88:51.61]Shelter.
[88:52.89]Yeah, let's build the shelter.
[88:54.57]We gotta get some vines, some sticks.
[88:58.26]Easy enough.
[89:00.68]I didn't want more dirty water, okay?
[89:05.14]Yeah, some of these games are... I mean, I'll tell you one, because, I mean, why not?
[89:09.90]Should I?
[89:10.50]No, fuck that.
[89:11.52]I want it to be a surprise.
[89:17.75]What the fuck?
[89:18.53]Like, no.
[89:19.61]Can I jump out?
[89:21.03]God damn it.
[89:23.75]I need to do this right, because this is going to take forever.
[89:28.69]Oh, this sucks.
[89:38.15]And by the way, some of these games... First, I'll tell you one.
[89:41.38]Demon's Souls.
[89:43.60]Demon's Souls is a game that I want to play.
[89:45.58]On stream.
[89:46.82]Played Dark Souls 3.
[89:48.20]I beat the whole thing.
[89:49.64]Beat all of Dark Souls 3 and the DLC on stream.
[89:53.38]I've played all the way through Dark Souls 2.
[89:55.36]I beat Dark Souls 2, not on stream.
[89:57.73]I got past Blighttown in Dark Souls 1 and then gave up because I'm a fucking wuss.
[90:02.41]And of course, I've beaten Bloodborne like seven different times.
[90:07.40]So, Demon's Souls is a game that I've just never fucking played, right?
[90:13.03]And I figured that would be, like, actually interesting because it's PlayStation 3 only.
[90:17.65]You can't get it on PS4.
[90:18.63]You have to have it on PlayStation 3.
[90:22.15]So, like, why not, right?
[90:23.90]That would be an interesting stream.
[90:24.84]I might even try to beat it.
[90:26.04]I don't know.
[90:27.10]We'll see how far I get.
[90:27.82]I need a large log.
[90:33.84]There it is.
[90:35.14]And then get back.
[90:37.22]Why am I interested in this game right now?
[90:38.66]This game is so bad.
[90:40.82]Why do I care about this?
[90:41.70]I'm like, oh, just get a large log?
[90:42.78]Okay, cool.
[90:43.62]Got it.
[90:43.86]Alright, swing.
[90:54.73]I've also heard, and you guys can tell me how much of, like, how true this is.
[90:58.83]I heard, is Demon's Souls more like Bloodborne?
[91:03.90]I've heard that that's kind of the case.
[91:07.57]And I think Bloodborne is my favorite out of all of them.
[91:12.97]So, is Demon's Souls more like Bloodborne?
[91:19.03]That was weird.
[91:20.68]Not at all.
[91:21.30]It's like Dark Souls 1.
[91:27.72]It would be a better game if the graphics were better.
[91:35.91]It's very slow and calculated.
[91:37.29]I don't know.
[91:38.94]I feel like it would be fun to try, though.
[91:41.80]I mean, if I'm going to play a bunch of PS3 games, I might as well play the PS3 game that everybody, you know, argues is the reason to own a PS3, right?
[91:53.77]Finite Healing and a Hub World are the only similarities.
[91:56.93]I thought that was going to come the other way.
[92:06.53]Demon's Souls has not aged well?
[92:11.16]Flush this game down the toilet and play Demon's Souls.
[92:18.94]Then we have to get to the next area and then I promise we'll delete it.
[92:25.40]Go on, go over it.
[92:29.59]But I do- it's not all awful fucking PlayStation 3 games.
[92:34.43]There are plenty- I got plenty of classics.
[92:38.14]What is this?
[92:39.00]Attack what?
[92:39.76]What am I attacking?
[92:40.84]The dirt?
[92:42.86]I just stepped on a leaf.
[92:44.46]What am I doing?
[92:47.34]What's going on?
[92:53.11]I was looking at chat and I turned back around.
[92:55.81]What was that?
[93:02.11]Apparently I got angry at some twigs.
[93:05.23]I'm...
[93:09.19]Oh my god, this is a PS3.
[93:10.07]Yeah, this is a PS3.
[93:10.85]Oh, it's a Scorpion.
[93:11.93]Okay.
[93:17.00]Yeah, this is PS3.
[93:19.64]Sitting on my PlayStation 3.
[93:22.12]Can we never speak of this game again?
[93:23.54]Yes.
[93:25.08]We don't have to ever... That's the thing, right?
[93:26.40]We don't ever have to talk about these games ever again.
[93:29.38]I made a pile of the 30 games that I purchased for PlayStation 3.
[93:34.94]Here's the thing.
[93:35.37]Here's the criteria.
[93:36.69]We'll go over the criteria.
[93:38.64]Uh, you cannot play these games anywhere else.
[93:42.04]That's criteria one.
[93:42.90]Like, I can't get these games on Steam, or, like, on the computer, or on PS4, or Xbox.
[93:47.53]Like, I have to play these on a PlayStation 3.
[93:50.81]Because that's the only place they exist.
[93:53.43]That's criteria one.
[93:54.07]Uh... Criteria two is... Will this potentially be an interesting stream?
[93:57.43]Okay, that's criteria two.
[94:11.06]Eh, shit.
[94:12.90]Can I jump out?
[94:14.20]Oh, fuck.
[94:15.86]No, no, where's this other one?
[94:18.06]Is it a boat?
[94:19.62]Can I get in the boat?
[94:22.72]Um... Yeah, so will this be, like, potentially an interesting stream, good or bad?
[94:28.47]Investigate.
[94:29.97]Found a... found boat four.
[94:31.45]Okay.
[94:31.97]Well, good.
[94:32.61]Thanks for nothing.
[94:35.29]And the other criteria was split into, like, stupid game, like Man vs. fucking, uh, Wild.
[94:43.14]Or old classic that I can only play on... Hold on a second.
[94:47.86]Get the fuck out of the way.
[94:48.92]Where am I going?
[94:55.14]Like, was I supposed to go up that way to the boat?
[95:00.74]God fucking dammit, man.
[95:02.20]I wasn't even paying attention.
[95:04.24]I looked the other way.
[95:08.78]I'm dead.
[95:09.54]No, I'm not.
[95:10.70]Just barely.
[95:11.16]Come on.
[95:12.59]Holy shit.
[95:13.29]I don't know what's happening, but I'm winning somehow.
[95:16.13]Okay.
[95:22.53]Up here.
[95:24.01]Apparently not.
[95:24.55]Are you serious?
[95:27.11]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[95:31.22]It was like the dumb glowy thing.
[95:34.75]Okay, well that was interesting.
[95:37.57]This is not even the right way.
[95:39.13]This is.
[95:44.32]Sony, point it in the clutch.
[95:46.60]So I would say out of like the 30 games, like probably like 14 of them are stupid fucking games, right?
[95:56.23]Like, for instance, one of the other games that we have is... I'll give you a sneak peek, okay?
[95:59.57]One of the other games we have is The Bourne Conspiracy.
[96:03.65]That's another one.
[96:04.19]That game's gonna be fucking dumb.
[96:05.43]It might be fun, though.
[96:06.12]I don't know.
[96:12.26]What?
[96:13.02]Where do I go now?
[96:16.28]This is the tip of the iceberg.
[96:17.61]I actually have to get on this.
[96:22.82]One of the good games that we have is Condemned 2, right?
[96:30.64]This is going a lot faster than I thought it was.
[96:48.32]I'm gonna run out of gas.
[96:50.68]Oh, damn.
[96:56.78]Did it explode?
[96:57.64]I think it exploded.
[97:02.03]This is really awkward to drive.
[97:07.78]Turning this just turns the back.
[97:09.32]It doesn't turn the front.
[97:10.36]Oh, goodness.
[97:10.92]Get the gas.
[97:23.94]What did this turn into?
[97:25.94]I have full gas.
[97:26.64]I don't even need to get this gas.
[97:32.67]That's how boats work?
[97:35.91]What is it?
[97:37.91]When you press right on the D-pad when you're driving a real boat, it turns to the right.
[97:43.77]He's holding a PlayStation 3 controller in his hand.
[97:52.74]I'm gonna get this gap.
[97:56.82]Didn't get it.
[97:57.40]It's okay.
[97:57.72]It's fine.
[98:02.56]Oh, we're going up a jump.
[98:03.63]We're gonna get a cutscene.
[98:04.27]We're gonna get a jump cutscene here.
[98:09.01]That was fucking terrible.
[98:10.19]Does it say I've been here before?
[98:24.21]Am I going in circles or something?
[98:25.45]I don't get it.
[98:28.73]There's plenty of, like, little experience blobs here, though.
[98:34.39]What the fuck?
[98:36.53]No one's driving the boat!
[98:37.47]Who's driving this boat?
[98:45.87]I'm so glad that I could... Time remaining.
[98:52.45]Oh, hold on.
[98:54.56]Oh, you can't say time remaining and then drop me.
[98:57.49]I had like a good 15 to 20 seconds there left.
[99:01.73]Time remaining.
[99:05.71]You just dropped me.
[99:06.77]Time remaining was bullshit.
[99:09.94]Would you like to take a quiz for the bonus survival points?
[99:13.90]Yes.
[99:14.96]What is the largest reptile in North America?
[99:18.72]The American alligator, the pangoo turtle, or the North American marmalock?
[99:24.62]Okay, well, this is a made-up animal.
[99:27.65]Marmulok?
[99:30.05]That sounds like a fucking shitty, like, Battlestar Galactica animal.
[99:33.43]No, it's an American alligator.
[99:36.54]Alright.
[99:37.64]What Native American tribe lived in the Everglades?
[99:42.16]Oh, God.
[99:45.25]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[99:47.29]My mother said to go to this one.
[99:50.97]Wrong.
[99:52.58]When was the alligator removed from the endangered species list?
[99:55.46]I don't know.
[99:56.80]Probably like in the 80s.
[99:58.36]Yeah, 87.
[99:59.26]How many claws do alligators have?
[100:00.80]What's with the alligators?
[100:02.06]Why is it all about alligators?
[100:03.42]How many claws?
[100:04.32]How many hands?
[100:04.90]Alligators don't have 20 hands.
[100:08.12]How could any of these be right?
[100:10.18]How many hands do an alligator, what are they, a fucking centipede?
[100:13.48]18 fucking hands?
[100:18.69]They're all wrong.
[100:20.91]Feeling lucky?
[100:21.45]Would you like to answer one more question for double or nothing?
[100:23.83]Yeah, double it up.
[100:25.27]How do catfish dig in the ground?
[100:27.97]They use their heads, they use their tails, they use their fins, they use their heads, they burrow.
[100:32.04]Got it.
[100:32.48]Fucking double or nothing.
[100:35.72]Mission complete.
[100:38.78]Claws of the nails.
[100:42.08]Three fires started.
[100:43.27]One fish caught.
[100:43.99]Two shelters.
[100:45.55]6,000 feet.
[100:46.57]Wow.
[100:46.93]That's a long way to go.
[100:48.11]Furthest distance from swam.
[100:50.81]Zero bugs eaten.
[100:51.73]That's good.
[100:52.19]89 feet altitude.
[100:54.20]We engaged.
[100:55.00]We endangered eight different animals.
[100:57.74]Alright.
[100:58.22]Let's go.
[101:01.82]Here we are.
[101:02.22]The Sahara.
[101:02.54]This is what we've been playing this the whole time for, guys.
[101:05.10]Hahaha.
[101:24.48]Why would you do that?
[101:25.42]What is he doing?
[101:26.58]He did this shit.
[101:28.30]That was just showing off.
[101:29.70]He's just showing off.
[101:30.71]He looks like he's dead floating there.
[101:34.25]That was just showing off.
[101:38.99]You don't have to go out of an airplane like that.
[101:40.73]You don't have to show off.
[101:41.83]Locate the Oasis, spend the night in the Sahara, survive a sandstorm, and get to the extraction point.
[101:51.59]PUBG.
[101:52.47]Oh, here we go.
[101:54.27]Remember our tricks.
[101:57.43]Ready, go.
[101:59.60]Double backflip.
[102:00.80]Okay, ready, go.
[102:05.74]Missed it.
[102:06.38]It's alright.
[102:07.80]Ready, go.
[102:15.29]Alright, deploy the parachute, quick.
[102:20.87]What the fuck is this?
[102:24.85]You're gonna give me like a pilot wings thing?
[102:27.02]This is cool.
[102:30.44]This is the coolest part of the whole game.
[102:32.32]You should have just made Bear Grylls jumps out of an airplane the video game.
[102:36.95]This is fucking relaxing.
[102:38.97]Look at the music.
[102:52.57]Oh, come on.
[102:53.29]You guys know what I was trying to do there and it just didn't work.
[102:58.71]I was trying to just plant into the fucking wall.
[103:00.19]Alright.
[103:00.41]Are you sure this isn't a PS2 game?
[103:01.47]It might be.
[103:02.29]They might have ported it to PS3.
[103:03.52]I don't know.
[103:03.92]I just bought the disk.
[103:27.26]At least this one will be bright.
[103:33.77]Why do I feel like there's gonna be a giant dinosaur or something that shows up, or a big animal?
[103:41.47]We don't get any guide anymore, I don't think.
[103:43.12]What happened to the HUD?
[103:43.80]There we go.
[103:47.82]Camel spider.
[103:51.12]Where?
[103:56.57]Where is this?
[103:57.21]Oh, there it is.
[104:06.02]Get it.
[104:07.26]Get it!
[104:08.54]Get it!
[104:10.32]Get it!
[104:10.68]There we go.
[104:14.58]Level up.
[104:15.20]Okay, let's improve our nutrition and our elemental resistance.
[104:19.24]This is a camel spider.
[104:20.82]They're like a cross between a scorpion and a spider.
[104:23.63]They can drive about six inches long.
[104:25.99]They're pretty aggressive.
[104:28.29]They can move fast, about 10 miles an hour, and I'm not particularly looking forward to eating this one, but it's going to be good protein and good energy.
[104:36.17]Can they actually run?
[104:37.15]I thought that was like a myth.
[104:38.61]I thought the whole camel spider can sprint faster than a human.
[104:44.93]It was like a myth or a joke or something.
[104:47.37]That's real?
[104:50.26]I need to climb this.
[104:51.28]Come on, give me something to climb.
[104:52.20]There we go.
[105:00.36]Camel spiders aren't even dangerous.
[105:03.78]300 IQ per hour.
[105:08.16]People can go faster than 10 miles per hour?
[105:10.15]Uh, what kind of people do you know?
[105:13.85]I know plenty of people that in a full sprint, they probably go, like, 4 miles per hour.
[105:18.33]Okay, so, like, I wanted to know one time, like, how fast I could run.
[105:23.15]So I told my buddy, like, this was back in, like, high school.
[105:25.86]We were in, like, the parking lot.
[105:27.30]And I was like, hey, go, like, 20 miles per hour, like, next to me.
[105:30.60]And I was, like, sprinting next to him.
[105:33.19]So first he was going, like, 5 miles per hour, and you don't even realize it.
[105:36.03]When you're outside of a car, and you see, like, when a car goes 5 miles per hour, and you're in the car, it's like, this is fucking slow, dude, holy shit, speed it up.
[105:45.12]But when you're outside of a car, and you're standing next to it, and it's going 5 miles per hour, damn, that shit, yeah, that's fucking real fast.
[105:56.24]What am I even attached to here?
[105:58.54]So I sprinted, like, 10, 20, like, miles per hour.
[106:01.82]I was in a full sprint next to the car, and it's like, holy shit, this is horrible.
[106:05.33]He got up to, like, 30, and, like, I started to, like, he started to lose me a little bit.
[106:08.89]I still, like, kept up with it, though.
[106:10.51]Once he started going, like, 40 to, like, 45 miles per hour, I was just like, fuck, man, like, I can't even... What the fuck was that?
[106:21.14]Wait, once it got to be about, like, 30 to 40 miles per hour, like, I actually started to lose me a little bit.
[106:28.38]But, you know, that's just the way it is, though.
[106:31.00]Is that a cobra?
[106:37.00]Yes, I don't know.
[106:46.23]Kilometers?
[106:46.71]No, we're talking miles per hour.
[106:47.91]Like, 40 miles per hour.
[106:52.71]Uh, which way do I go?
[106:53.35]This way?
[106:53.91]I need a drink.
[106:54.51]Holy shit, I'm losing fucking resistance.
[106:59.79]The record was 47 miles per hour seen during the final 100 meters of the World Championships in Berlin by Usain Bolt.
[107:05.89]Bolt's average speed was 20... No, my friend was going 40.
[107:11.88]And I was just like... Like, smashing into the ground.
[107:17.44]And, like, he was going, like, 42.
[107:18.40]I think that's what, like, I got clocked at.
[107:22.77]I didn't, like, there was no, like, record people around.
[107:24.45]Like, why would I, like... I didn't know, like, that was a thing people did.
[107:31.37]Where the fuck am I going, by the way?
[107:32.83]Like, get me up there.
[107:38.47]Can I climb this?
[107:39.11]Go.
[107:45.03]I started to sweat a little bit, and I started to slow down.
[107:47.45]Because there wasn't a whole lot of room left for him to... God damn it.
[107:57.44]Really?
[107:59.27]They just throw that at you.
[108:00.23]I didn't know that was going to happen.
[108:06.41]I should have raced Usain Bolt on livestream.
[108:10.05]What was his fastest time?
[108:10.99]27 miles per hour?
[108:13.89]I was going like 40.
[108:14.45]I mean, I would blow by him.
[108:15.25]You know the treadmill at the gym?
[108:29.42]Yep.
[108:30.32]You know the guy at the gym that's on the treadmill, and he's going way too fast, and it's really annoying, and it's kind of pissing everybody off at the gym?
[108:38.69]The guy that is seriously flatfoot smashing into the ground, and you can hear the treadmill.
[108:44.49]It's like that... And it's like... That's me.
[108:46.45]And how fast does the treadmill go?
[108:59.18]I put it at max and sprint.
[109:01.99]Maximum.
[109:06.31]And I just hammer.
[109:07.65]And those things go like 60 miles per hour.
[109:15.94]Somebody look up what the maximum treadmill speed is.
[109:21.40]And I think it's somewhere around like 60 to 70 miles per hour.
[109:23.69]And that's what I do.
[109:29.71]I'm actually going to die.
[109:32.11]Oh shit, I am gonna die.
[109:34.43]Is there like a stream somewhere?
[109:35.49]I really am dying.
[109:41.81]What is following me?
[109:42.75]Something's behind me.
[109:43.81]No.
[109:43.95]Alright, here we go.
[109:44.61]Look at the oasis.
[109:49.93]Fatal scorpion.
[109:50.67]Alright, drink the water.
[109:54.48]There we go.
[109:57.50]20 miles per hour.
[109:58.34]He has like 20... What are you talking about?
[110:10.80]On a scooter.
[110:13.34]No, it's...
[110:16.17]I could probably run in a full sprint.
[110:19.65]I'm not joking.
[110:21.55]Maybe, like, 80 to 90 miles per hour.
[110:28.13]Can you fucking imagine how terrifying that would be?
[110:30.18]Imagine a guy that could run 90.
[110:32.76]Okay, I wouldn't even have to take a car.
[110:37.61]I could just fucking run somewhere, like on the highway, and go faster than the cars.
[110:46.52]That would be terrifying.
[110:47.34]It would be like a bug.
[110:49.34]You know when you see one of those spiders?
[110:51.58]The hard to kill spiders, the ones that you look at them the right way, and they sprint like 10,000 miles per hour, and it's terrifying?
[110:58.38]Imagine a person being like that.
[111:07.88]Oh no, another scorpion.
[111:15.52]Killing this animal would be a mistake.
[111:18.59]Even though he'll return, I'm just gonna scare him.
[111:25.11]Alright, let's go down.
[111:28.73]Imagine going that fast and accidentally losing your balance.
[111:32.82]If you could run 80 miles per hour and you lost your balance for a second,
[111:38.13]You know in GTA when you're inside of a plane and you like do the thing where you fly and you match the... What's this thing?
[111:46.80]Survive a sandstorm.
[111:47.90]Okay.
[111:50.14]When you match like the speed of every car and then you fly yourself out.
[111:53.35]Telephone poles?
[111:53.97]Get out of the storm.
[112:06.84]Okay, I lost my train of thought because this is I don't know I don't know what the hell is going on here But apparently I have like another like two minutes to survive this What is this?

[112:41.03]Why would I take this out?
[112:43.75]Oh, he's actually gonna do it.
[112:48.51]I can't believe this.
[112:49.72]Oh my god, this is fucking disgusting.

[113:28.80]Survival isn't a joke.
[113:30.68]What is this?
[113:31.92]Another fucking dumb scorpion.
[113:33.58]No, this is just like a salamander.
[113:36.18]No, like, let him go.
[113:37.00]I'm not gonna kill him.
[113:39.60]Let the salamander go.
[113:40.60]I'm not gonna kill the salamander.
[113:44.60]Why would I kill an amphibian?
[113:47.42]You're gonna think I'm gonna, like, destroy my own, like, my own people, like frogs and salamanders and shit?
[113:56.73]The heart is the lizard.
[114:02.59]I killed an alligator?
[114:04.27]Alligator's not an amphibian.
[114:05.33]It's a reptile.
[114:06.41]Excuse me.
[114:08.45]Like, excuse me.
[114:12.35]Crocodile, alligator, reptile.
[114:15.99]Salamander, frog, amphibian.
[114:19.87]Sorry, guys.
[114:21.17]Not gonna tell anybody, but I don't know my own amphibians.
[114:27.28]What the fuck are you doing?
[114:29.84]Just go.
[114:30.52]This is easier than the other one.
[114:42.09]Play as the gator.
[114:45.17]You're excused.
[114:46.05]Alright, give this a little spin.
[114:56.43]And good.
[114:57.58]Delicious.
[115:00.82]Now I need a shelter.

[115:04.28]I need palm fronds.
[115:05.80]Okie dokie.
[115:06.18]Just six of these.
[115:07.08]Is this real?
[115:07.68]So in the Sahara...
[115:25.62]You... It's unbearably hot in the day.
[115:29.08]Like, it's like 500 degrees Fahrenheit during the day.
[115:32.04]And it's like negative 8 degrees... Like, negative 10 degrees Celsius.
[115:37.32]Like, during the night.
[115:40.65]That sucks.
[115:42.21]Is that real?
[115:43.75]That's real?
[115:45.03]It's a real thing?
[115:49.29]I didn't even cover myself.
[115:50.57]How would this be... I don't understand.
[115:56.02]Sand does a really bad job of keeping heat.
[115:57.70]Alright, well, I get it.
[115:58.84]Yeah, I guess.
[116:02.27]Scorpion's gonna, like, stab me right in the neck.
[116:04.87]I'm gonna, like, dodge.

[117:24.02]No.
[117:25.46]No, I refuse.
[117:28.22]Why Kickin' Ketchup?
[117:30.38]Right now, Scarlo, thanks for the bits.
[117:32.54]Do you play games on your own, not on stream?

[118:05.03]Like, if you took me and said, like, oh, like, I like killing animals.
[118:07.57]Like, and you took that clip and you used it, like, with me, like, killing animals or something.
[118:11.37]I don't want to do that.
[118:14.83]Like, why would I do that?
[118:15.97]I'm not going to give you, like, an opportunity to, like, do something like that.
[118:20.52]Anyway.
[118:27.24]No, no, no.
[118:27.96]Like, that's, I'm giving you an example.

[118:33.20]Oh, my God.
[118:35.67]Unbelievable!
[118:42.26]Alex James, thanks for the two bucks.
[118:43.71]Just a warning, Jerma.
[118:44.91]If you so much as harm a single crab in this game, then the crab police are going to be notified.
[118:49.82]That's fine.
[118:52.31]Alright, I think that catches me up.
[118:56.23]It does.
[118:57.50]Captain Dark, thank you for the two bucks.
[119:00.00]Yeah, that was you that said that.
[119:02.64]Bobo Charity, thanks for the bits.
[119:03.98]Muse and, of course, Scarwell.
[119:06.00]Thank you.
[119:06.80]You guys are great.
[119:07.40]Out here, the temperature can hit 125 degrees.
[119:10.99]But that's my point.
[119:11.77]See, exactly my point.
[119:12.86]Somebody's going to prove my point, and there'll be a clip somewhere of me being like, oh, a Jerma kills, like, fucking snakes and, like, burns people and, like, kills people and eats animals.
[119:24.68]And then it'll show up, and I'll be upset about it.
[119:29.45]What am I investigating?
[119:32.51]Investigate what?
[119:36.37]Found a tank gun.
[119:37.75]What?
[119:42.98]Termite eats animals.
[119:44.08]Alright, well, let me, like, refill my drink.
[119:47.34]Is my canteen full?
[119:55.69]Get out of this.
[119:58.63]Fill up the canteen.
[120:00.67]And then, like, here we go.
[120:02.04]Please.
[120:06.10]Oh, like, you know, another one.
[120:06.98]I could say, like, for instance, like...
[120:11.37]You find the secret clip that you can use to make me look bad.
[120:14.94]I enjoy going to the mall.
[120:24.10]Poo is not the most clean substance in the world.
[120:31.25]My life is pretty interesting right now.
[120:35.15]It's pretty fun.
[120:37.63]I'm really a big fan of pants.
[120:40.75]Go for it.
[120:41.49]You guys know.
[120:42.57]Somebody will take that and make me look bad.
[120:49.51]And there's nothing I can do about it.
[120:56.52]It's happened to me before.
[120:58.36]So don't think you're going to shock me by making me say something.
[121:06.75]It's not going to shock me.
[121:12.90]Now let's go... Where are we going?
[121:13.86]Down here?
[121:14.48]Slide?
[121:15.75]Yep.
[121:20.74]I can't jump this.
[121:21.50]God damn it.
[121:23.56]And I'm gonna make Jerma say he poos his pants and his career will be over.
[121:27.75]What?
[121:27.95]I thought he was stopping the game.
[121:29.35]Landmines!
[121:29.59]What the fuck?
[121:29.91]Hold on.
[121:30.21]You tell me there's landmines in this game.
[121:32.01]No way.
[121:55.89]What?
[121:56.97]Hold it.
[121:58.07]Alright, no, hold on a minute.
[122:03.00]I want to step on one.
[122:06.20]You're not going to let me step on one of these?
[122:08.48]For fun?
[122:12.92]There's more.
[122:13.32]There's another one.
[122:13.80]Okay, the other one's like over there.
[122:24.40]You'd think you'd want to be a little bit further away.
[122:26.32]Okay, well... I guess that's just a, like, scripted event.
[122:33.58]It's just fake danger.
[122:34.68]Oh, it's just some more fake danger.
[122:39.35]Oh no.
[122:40.53]Look out.
[122:41.53]That's very close, by the way.
[122:48.83]There's, like, bouncy balls.
[122:50.37]There's not even fucking rocks.
[122:54.64]What the fuck, man?
[122:55.74]Come on.
[122:56.66]This is really close.
[122:59.11]That actually scared me.
[123:02.99]This is a bouncy ball from, like, the supermarket kiosk thing.
[123:08.83]Now, you know those things that take, like, 50 cents and give you a bouncy ball?
[123:12.76]I wish I could step on one.
[123:14.64]That'd be great.
[123:24.79]You know what I'm talking about?
[123:25.67]The thing with the sticky hands?
[123:28.09]Those were really, really cool when I was younger.
[123:31.11]Sticky hands.
[123:34.21]With the long arm, and you could swing them around and slap them onto a car windshield.
[123:44.60]I want to step on these.
[123:45.80]This is dumb.
[123:47.42]Where's the danger bear?
[123:48.50]Come on.
[123:53.65]Let's try to get them at the same time.
[123:59.83]Nope.
[124:00.75]Apparently I didn't get this one.
[124:01.65]I'm going to have two explosions back to back.
[124:08.66]This is really awkward.
[124:16.40]There's got to be a better way to do this.
[124:21.21]You had a Spider-Man sticky hand?
[124:22.95]Yeah.
[124:25.19]It's cool.
[124:26.69]You would try to spin him around and hit your friend in the face, and it would stick to their face.
[124:31.91]One time, my brother told me this story, and it's actually a pretty funny story.
[124:34.56]I don't know why it made me think of this.
[124:36.88]So, my brother's friend... This is dangerous.
[124:41.18]This is back like 10, this is probably 20 years ago.
[124:45.27]My brother's friend was left, like, alone.
[124:48.39]Like, his parents went somewhere when he was, like, I don't know, like, he was home alone for, like, he was probably, like, 16 or something.
[124:56.74]I just, that was pretty sick, by the way.
[124:58.00]I did, like, two of those.
[124:59.98]And his mother bought the kid just a shit, because he knew the kid couldn't, like, cook, and they were going to be gone for, like, four or five days.
[125:08.48]So the mother got, like, three pounds of deli turkey, right?
[125:14.25]So, like, you know, three pounds of deli turkey, maybe, like, two pounds of, like, American cheese and, like, a bunch of bread.
[125:20.07]Because they were like, yeah, you're a fucking idiot.
[125:21.63]You don't know how to cook.
[125:22.28]Here's a bunch of, like, fucking cheese and deli meat and bread.
[125:26.00]Well, he didn't, like, eat any of it.
[125:27.82]He ate maybe, like, two sandwiches worth.
[125:30.18]And my brother went over to the guy's house.
[125:33.02]This was, like, a day before the parents come back.
[125:35.00]And he wasn't going to eat this, like, three pounds of turkey.
[125:38.81]So he, like, walked in the front door.
[125:41.49]And this kid took the whole stack of like the three fucking pounds of deli turkey and slapped my brother right in the mouth.
[125:48.66]Like, like, like, like fished him.
[125:50.30]Like, and it went everywhere.
[125:52.50]And it was like, and they stopped talking after that.
[125:55.00]And they're no longer friends.
[125:56.54]That animal's dead.
[126:00.13]Okay.
[126:01.69]That changed it.
[126:08.62]Lethal quicksand.
[126:09.93]Lethal quicksand.
[126:10.57]Okay, he got hit in the face with like three pounds of deli turkey.
[126:12.87]And then they got in a fight.
[126:13.81]And I don't think he ever talked to the kid again after that.
[126:29.35]Holy shit, this is gonna be extremely tedious.
[126:37.97]Didn't we just see an animal get sucked into this?
[126:45.91]Isn't that much bigger than me?
[126:46.80]Can I drink?
[126:49.18]I mean, not necessarily, like, an interesting story, but I don't know.
[126:51.24]I was thinking, like, getting slapped in the face with something, like, big.
[126:54.58]First thing I've got to do is get these bloody clothes off.
[126:57.44]Try walking far like this, you're just going to get massive rubbing all the way under your armpits and inside your legs.
[127:03.24]You'll be rubbed red raw in half an hour.
[127:05.49]I want to get as much of the grit off me as I can.
[127:07.73]You know what I'm saying.
[127:08.35]If I don't, the grit in my armpits and groin will make my skin erupt in horrible infections and boils.
[127:13.37]What is he saying?
[127:14.39]Is he grinding his armpits?
[127:15.87]You could end up with painful, prickly heat rash.
[127:19.19]I don't want this in my armpits.
[127:22.59]Get the shit out of my armpit.
[127:32.14]That's fucking raw.
[127:35.44]Tell us more about getting slapped in the face with me.
[127:37.26]That's the whole story.
[127:37.94]It's not really like a story as much as it's just like a retelling of an event that happened.
[127:45.09]See, that's the thing.
[127:45.91]When I tell something like that, people say, like, hey, hey, tell the Oreo story.
[127:50.50]What the fuck, dude?
[127:51.12]Finish the Oreo story.
[127:53.22]There's no story.
[127:54.06]Like, I'm just retelling an event.
[127:56.74]Just as it happened.
[127:58.10]Right?
[128:00.12]People think that there's, like, more to that story.
[128:02.46]There isn't.
[128:03.96]I threw up in my mother's bed after eating a sleeve of Oreos when I was sick one time.
[128:10.98]That's the whole story.
[128:15.02]There's nothing else.
[128:19.40]I ate a bunch of Oreos when I didn't feel good, and I fucking hurled into my mother's bed.
[128:24.96]Because I was, like, I didn't feel good.
[128:26.73]And I went up and I was, like, trying to talk to her.
[128:28.05]And she was like, I don't feel good, Mom.
[128:31.75]Why?
[128:31.95]Because, like, I walked upstairs because I, like, I really didn't feel well.
[128:34.29]And I wanted her to know that I wasn't feeling well.
[128:38.81]And I got, like, lightheaded and was like, fuck, I need to, like, I need to lie down.
[128:42.49]Otherwise I would have, like, passed out.
[128:45.15]And then, like, like, fucking into the bed.
[128:49.76]And she still has that bed.
[128:51.22]She didn't get rid of that bed.
[128:52.30]She still sleeps on that bed still.
[128:54.98]Still there?
[128:58.15]That's a helicopter.
[128:59.48]If I can get its attention, I'm out of the desert and back to safety.
[129:06.90]Oh yeah, she like turned the mattress over.
[129:08.62]It's fine, don't worry about it.
[129:13.91]Oh no, look out for the final boss fight.
[129:16.41]Scorpion, before you get extracted.
[129:18.47]Oh, let him go.
[129:25.90]He's gone.
[129:26.72]You did it.
[129:27.16]Congratulations.
[129:28.94]Go to the extraction point.
[129:36.93]Cross the quicksand, get grabbed by the helicopter, and then end the game.
[129:42.95]Get to the end.
[129:50.60]I'm surprised I've actually done this much of this game.
[129:56.58]I've almost completed the game.
[130:07.61]The Pomeranian game was better.
[130:09.09]Oh, I'm well aware of that.
[130:14.99]I don't know why I can't stop playing this.
[130:17.65]It's got me.
[130:18.15]I don't know why.
[130:23.37]Burn this game on stream?
[130:26.26]This game was actually expensive.
[130:27.82]You guys wanna know how much this game was?
[130:29.11]Let me look at the box.
[130:35.51]Okay, this is kind of embarrassing.
[130:40.49]You wanna see how fucking much this game was?
[130:42.35]Okay.
[130:45.88]Here you go.
[130:46.40]You wanna see?

[130:55.04]Okay.
[130:55.18]Okay.

[131:34.51]It was funny.
[131:35.43]It was fun to play was interesting Yeah, come on What am I doing with the knife?
[131:43.54]I thought I was going to stab myself.
[131:48.26]What is this, Excalibur?
[131:49.24]What the fuck are you doing?
[131:53.42]I thought I was going to get to the top and jam it in my neck.
[131:57.08]There's no quick time event to jump on the helicopter this time.
[132:05.10]Would you like a quiz?
[132:06.10]Alright, I'm going to do my quiz.
[132:13.85]How large can camel spiders grow to be?
[132:15.86]Oh, this is 10 inches.
[132:17.34]That's wrong.
[132:18.62]In the Sahara, how much water can you lose an hour?
[132:20.58]A gallon.
[132:21.46]That's wrong.
[132:22.62]How long would it take for the sting of a fat-tailed scorpion to kill a full-grown man?
[132:26.64]Two hours.
[132:27.58]Wrong.
[132:28.74]How long can the temperature in the Sahara get at night?
[132:31.98]Way below freezing.
[132:32.98]Correct.
[132:34.33]Feeling lucky?
[132:34.89]Double or nothing.
[132:36.23]How deep will a sandfish burrow?
[132:38.13]Three feet.
[132:38.99]Got it.
[132:39.55]And we get fucking 10 points.
[132:41.55]Not even a big deal.
[132:46.86]No bugs eaten, we're good.
[132:49.00]Hunger is meaningless, by the way.
[132:51.50]We've come to realize in this game, hunger is fucking meaningless.
[132:54.43]Deserted island?
[132:56.25]Hurricane, see?
[132:56.71]The guy that was having a hurricane problem, like, watch this one.
[133:13.62]Well, I'll be getting too close to comfort with the locals, fighting my way onto storm-battered islands and struggling to stay afloat on a small raft as I paddle through Big Surf.
[133:24.00]This island Paradise will be no walk in the park.
[133:27.15]Oh, there's so many games here.
[133:28.69]Alright, hold on.
[133:31.19]Navigate through, look, we're done.
[133:32.95]We're done with this game, I promise.
[133:37.89]We've actually been playing this game for two and a half hours.
[133:39.81]That's actually kind of remarkable.
[133:45.30]Boy, there are sharks in here.
[133:48.60]Keep the black dot and the green circle.
[133:50.17]Hit the water at a safe angle.
[133:52.77]What do you mean, safe angle?
[133:57.65]What?
[133:58.45]Wait, what are you doing?
[134:06.56]It just puts you right back.
[134:09.86]Alright, let's do it at a safe angle.
[134:12.36]Alright, safe.
[134:13.72]We're gonna be safe about this.
[134:15.04]You just gotta do the pencil and you'll be fine.
[134:18.46]Swim to safety.
[134:20.03]Look out for the sharks.
[134:21.87]Is this an instant kill?
[134:22.73]It probably is.
[134:23.41]We need to see it.
[134:24.01]Yeah, it's just the same exact thing as the alligator.
[134:29.41]Doesn't even matter.
[134:33.45]It's just the alligator.
[134:35.86]That was a frog splash.
[134:37.88]Weird.
[134:39.96]What would actually happen if you did that?
[134:42.00]If you landed out of an airplane on your back in the water, like belly flop style, what would actually happen to you?
[134:52.56]Would all your insides explode?
[134:59.79]So this is just a deserted... Wait, hold on.
[135:02.17]We need to see.
[135:04.43]We need to see what this is.
[135:05.67]And then I'm going to turn it off.
[135:06.59]Well, I'm going to put a different game in.
[135:14.16]It would be like hitting concrete, so you would just explode.
[135:19.84]I'm addicted.
[135:20.56]I don't know why I can't stop playing this game.
[135:22.54]This game is not fun.
[135:25.61]This is not a fun game.
[135:26.35]What do I have to do?
[135:28.01]What am I doing here?
[135:28.63]Grab a hermit crab?
[135:29.73]Oh my god, okay.
[135:30.37]Alright, I'm done.
[135:31.11]Tiger shark?
[135:53.31]We're on a deserted island.
[135:54.67]Give me one second.
[135:56.05]I need to see.
[135:56.55]I have to know.
[135:58.73]This is more hermit crabs.
[135:59.79]I don't care about hermit crabs.
[136:02.03]Just eat them raw.
[136:09.83]Alright.
[136:10.13]We're done.
[136:11.15]We've seen everything there is to see in this game.
[136:15.20]We're done.
[136:15.74]I promise we're done.
[136:23.60]What?
[136:24.43]Oh, God.
[136:26.05]Wait a minute.
[136:28.95]Hold on a second.
[136:29.61]Guys, there's a fucking active volcano on this island.
[136:35.35]You know what I mean?
[136:36.73]There's a volcano that's going to erupt.
[136:44.78]Fucking volcano, man.
[136:46.26]Really?
[136:46.54]You're going to make me quit the game with the active volcano?
[136:50.24]No.
[136:53.16]Alright, alright.
[136:53.74]We're done.
[136:54.20]We're out.
[136:55.18]We're out.
[136:55.72]I'm done.
[136:57.94]We're done.
[136:58.84]We're not gonna play.
[136:59.48]We've been playing this like two and a half hours.
[137:01.04]I know.
[137:01.40]Alright.
[137:02.64]So.
[137:04.78]Uh.
[137:05.94]Let's see.
[137:06.88]Let's see what we can do.
[137:10.14]These two need the PlayStation camera, so I can't play those yet.
[137:13.36]Hold on.
[137:14.82]You know, I could play the, um.
[137:18.30]Go back to Tokyo Jungle.
[137:20.53]and play the alligator, I promised I'd do a round of that.
[137:22.77]That'd probably take like half an hour or so.
[137:25.51]Hmm.
[137:26.89]I mean, this one might not be very long.
[137:29.71]Yeah, okay.
[137:30.17]We're gonna punch in another one.
[137:32.85]We got another one here on tap that could be fucking awful.
[137:37.14]And there's a lot of these.
[137:38.26]So, like, we're gonna keep the same theme, alright?
[137:41.94]We're gonna keep the theme of, like, surviving.
[137:45.40]Surviving in the wild.
[137:46.48]We're gonna keep the theme.
[137:47.68]Punch it in.
[137:52.21]I'm going to do this on camera.
[137:54.85]Because it could be fucking dangerous.
[137:57.87]See this stack of games over here?
[138:00.77]This is the one right here that we need.
[138:03.99]We're going to be careful about this.
[138:05.48]Like Jenga.
[138:21.48]Get the fuck out of here.
[138:23.04]Didn't think that was going to happen, did you?
[138:24.55]Alright, give me one minute.
