[01:03.81]Okay.
[01:04.47]What do you mean?
[01:05.83]What is that?
[01:06.59]What is that?
[01:07.41]Didn't get me anything.
[01:13.02]Huh.
[01:18.42]Not gonna, uh... I mean, I looked out the window and I noticed, uh... Lawn still ain't cut.
[01:26.40]Am I gonna go do that?
[01:27.58]Or...
[01:33.63]It's getting kind of tall.
[01:36.49]Look how long it is.
[01:38.33]It's getting a little tall.
[01:43.15]And last night, I just want to... Your mother was coming in with the groceries, and you were playing that cartoon game with the walls, like the Minecraft shooter, whatever it is.
[01:55.00]Fortnite.
[01:56.12]You didn't get up and help your mother with the groceries.
[01:57.80]I had to...
[02:02.75]Thank you, though, kids.
[02:06.47]Is this shit that your dad said?
[02:13.83]Maybe at another time.
[02:15.73]Not this current time, though.
[02:18.54]Anyways, hello.
[02:19.30]Yes.
[02:20.18]Happy Father's Day, though.
[02:21.76]What we're going to do... I'm going to block out a plan for you.
[02:25.94]Are you ready for this plan?
[02:28.10]At the end of this week, I am not going to be here.
[02:32.57]I mean like physically not gonna be here I have some things going on I am visiting some family and during that same time period about five days or so I'm gonna be doing a lot of work on a big stream so I'm gonna be spending a lot of time putting it together getting it ready and that's what I'm gonna be doing 50-50 family and like working on a stream
[03:02.81]So, I will not be here for about five days.
[03:06.64]That was disgusting.
[03:08.92]I'm really sorry.
[03:11.84]I've got another colonoscopy.
[03:13.56]No, no, no, no.
[03:16.06]That's the fucking most disgusting sound ever.
[03:18.38]This is why I can't be live.
[03:22.82]See, if this was a recording, I would have been like, alright, whatever, that's here.
[03:25.94]And then I would have gone in and I would have cut that out.
[03:27.96]I would have just taken the razor tool and right where it went...
[03:32.11]cut that part of the audio cut that part of the audio at the end delete and then put like background noise there and you wouldn't even know I did it a million times you know how many times I fucking sneezed on a video and just it was gone and I manipulated the video to a point where you didn't know I sneezed on it anywho today we're gonna do the movies we're gonna go back to the movies
[03:58.33]Talked about it yesterday.
[03:59.19]It's been a long enough time where I think it will be fun to go back in.
[04:02.42]And also, not just about that.
[04:06.90]Just about that.
[04:07.58]But more importantly here, five community subs just came in from Dermalight about the clown car.
[04:12.22]Thank you for the five community subs.
[04:16.19]Appreciate the five subs.
[04:18.61]Dermalight about the clown car.
[04:22.05]But,
[04:23.49]I'm going to give you the, let's break it down.
[04:24.93]So today, we're going to play the movies.
[04:27.46]I'm going to re-familiarize myself with the game.
[04:30.50]Because it's been like two or three years.
[04:32.10]I don't really remember all the tools.
[04:34.28]We're just going to go through the beginning of the game.
[04:36.48]Maybe start a new studio, make a few things, whatever.
[04:38.54]And relax and play and learn the game again, kind of.
[04:41.37]Now, I also have like a hundred fucking mods.
[04:44.77]Like 40 characters, like 50 new sets, like hundreds of props.
[04:49.85]I have tons of fucking mods.
[04:51.65]We're not going to use those today.
[04:54.27]Because I want to make sure I know what I'm doing and where we're going.
[04:58.76]So there's going to be two movie streams.
[05:01.00]This one's going to be the re-familiarize and make some movies.
[05:04.46]And the one after is going to be the fuck you table of movie streams.
[05:11.74]I don't want to give any spoilers as to some of these characters that are in it.
[05:15.20]But I hope they all work.
[05:18.61]Also, Star and I are going to be playing Deep Rock Galactic at some point this week as well.
[05:25.94]So that's what's going to be happening for the remainder of this week.
[05:28.76]We're going to play that Dwarf game, whatever the hell it is.
[05:32.48]So now that we've gone over that, you can understand what you can expect this week.
[05:39.31]Like, fucking sick.
[05:40.69]Okay, let's open up the movies.
[05:43.55]If you don't know the movies...
[05:47.18]You're not a true Gemma fan.
[05:51.52]This is some of the best, most fun I think we've ever had on camera.
[05:56.68]I think, I would say.
[06:04.66]Gatekeeping your own channel.
[06:09.44]Yeah, I was just like, yeah, that's what it is.
[06:11.78]Gatekeeping my own channel.
[06:13.94]Why am I doing that?
[06:17.74]Let's go.
[06:23.09]Uh, you cannot hear anything, but you will be able to see... Well, actually, never mind.
[06:25.81]You can see things now.
[06:28.13]You remember this screen?
[06:30.93]It's been a while.
[06:33.03]So, I remember a little bit... I remember a little bit about the game.
[06:36.82]I remember, like, a few things that are very important to know.
[06:39.88]But I don't think I need to do, like... I know how to, like, move the camera and shit.
[06:43.76]If I need help, I can go do it, right?
[06:46.56]We're gonna do a new game?
[06:50.25]uh studio poor productions what's this is important I need to make an actor you're gonna make directors and like and cameramen and stuff oh yeah pop out your eyes productions no no no no no we got this is a different studio that studio was liquidated

[07:20.84]Back up.
[07:22.28]Yes, I know.
[07:22.98]Hi.

[07:49.64]Leo Incorporated.
[07:51.12]Leo P-Pants Productions.
[07:52.70]No, it's not going to be Leo P-Pants.
[07:54.62]I don't know.
[08:02.92]Prime Chuck Productions?
[08:07.11]The name of your studio doesn't matter.
[08:09.03]It shows nobody...
[08:20.53]P-Pants Limited?
[08:26.69]Bursting with laughter.
[08:29.55]Big chin productions.
[08:36.38]P-Pants Limited LLC.
[08:39.14]P-Pants Limited Limited Liability Company.
[08:42.38]No, that sucks.
[08:44.32]That's like too easy of a joke.
[08:54.70]P-Pants liability.
[08:56.45]How do you... Should it be P-Pants liability?
[09:00.29]P-Pants limited Leo liability.
[09:02.77]Limited Leo company.
[09:19.72]How about just P-Pants liability?
[09:25.49]two no I'm not naming my company machinima it'll get liquidated in like less than five years got it pee pants liquidated company sounds pretty good to me name
[09:57.83]No, that's my name.
[10:00.17]Okay, P-Pants Liquidated is the name of the company.
[10:01.90]I don't have any actors, though.
[10:09.39]Welcome to the dawn of the movie industry.
[10:11.87]The same fucking thing happened last time I played this.
[10:13.75]The year is 1920, and your new studio's success lies in your hands.
[10:19.25]You must guide it to greatness.
[10:21.67]You must create the biggest movie industry and employ the most famous stars as you strive to reach the summit of the studio charts and reap the rewards of victory.
[10:33.18]First, build a thriving studio.
[10:35.82]We gotta have actors?
[10:38.12]Here comes the old content.
[10:40.08]We're stuck.
[10:53.45]Soon, stars from rival companies will flock to your studio, and you'll unlock new technology, scenes, and sets to make your movies better than ever.
[11:03.95]But once you unlock those mods, there's no going back.
[11:07.58]That's why you have to wait till the next stream.
[11:10.54]Because once fucking Batman shows up and dropkicks R2-D2 through a glass pane, we ain't doing the regular game again.
[11:20.82]Turn this shit up.
[11:23.66]Okay.
[11:25.66]Let me get a audio.
[11:27.74]Let's turn it up.
[11:32.70]That sounds a little bit better, don't you think?
[11:34.58]Alright, here's our lot.
[11:39.17]We need to make some stuff.
[11:40.05]I remember some of this.
[11:46.06]We need the, uh, the box office, right?
[11:48.46]Stage school, right?
[11:49.50]Yep.
[11:49.58]You can place the stage school anywhere by left-clicking at the desired location.
[11:53.64]Let's go, like, here.
[11:54.60]Go ahead.
[11:55.40]Give it a try.
[11:56.84]We've already done the regular game.
[11:58.10]I'm only doing this because I... I just need to re-familiarize myself with the tools and the controls.
[12:02.67]I can't just jump into sandbox mode?
[12:04.59]Because, like, I'll just have no idea what I'm doing.
[12:06.69]It's been three years since I did the same video in the same stream.
[12:11.25]Center it?
[12:11.73]What do you mean, center it?
[12:14.73]It's off-center.
[12:17.22]It's always going to be off-center.
[12:18.10]Alright, right there.
[12:19.93]Yeah, get the... There's a staff, right?
[12:21.73]Oh, that's right.
[12:22.21]You gotta go to the studio gate.
[12:24.25]Okay, here we go.
[12:25.11]Yeah, you... They're actually, like, janitors, right?
[12:27.47]And stuff?
[12:27.69]You have to actually create people.
[12:29.33]We need builders, we need janitors.
[12:30.33]Okay.
[12:44.78]great here we have builders perform any building and maintenance duties automatically so you can leave them to it fantastic while the stage school is being built you can use this time to sort out the rest of the buildings which we need uh active studio right
[12:59.80]You need one janitor?
[13:01.16]No, if you're playing a game like this, you need like 30 janitors, and you need to put them in patrols in tiny little locations.
[13:08.65]Okay, let's keep going.
[13:09.33]Casting office, right.
[13:10.27]Let's go over here.
[13:10.93]Casting office would be down here.
[13:12.23]Pee pants liability company is, you know, we gotta make it clean.
[13:31.26]I'm thinking, like, right here.
[13:35.15]Yep.
[13:35.51]Crew facility.
[13:36.69]Crew.
[13:36.87]Yep.
[13:37.13]Yep.
[13:37.27]Yep.
[13:37.41]We'll have this up here.
[13:38.63]Yep.
[13:38.73]You need to jam it.
[13:39.59]Let's get a few builders, actually.
[13:53.37]Okay, you'll also need a set to shoot your movie on.
[13:57.33]The stage set will be perfect for you.
[13:58.97]You're making a porn studio.
[14:00.72]I am not making a porn studio.
[14:01.86]Let's select the stage set.
[14:05.36]Stage, right, stage.
[14:07.98]This is our first little baby set.
[14:09.32]Remember, this is like 1920.
[14:09.98]Let's go, let's go like over here.
[14:16.22]Back here.
[14:16.80]Finally, build a production office.
[14:19.00]You'll need this to release your movie.
[14:21.79]Oh, you edit it right.
[14:22.81]I forgot about this.
[14:23.69]There's so much.
[14:24.29]I forgot.
[14:24.65]We're gonna be here for a while.
[14:27.50]Production office is gonna be over here.
[14:33.28]Uh, where do I want this?
[14:33.98]Maybe I should put it over here.
[14:39.31]Like, right here.
[14:43.07]Alright, we got everything we need.
[14:46.61]It's the perfect time to get the jump on the porn industry.
[14:48.97]Imagine how rich you could get if you invented porn.
[14:54.98]one of the keys to running a successful studio is making sure your staff can easily find their way around okay placing down some paths click on the landscaping button then select the sparkling path icon lay a path by left clicking and dragging out the shape on the ground connect everything flashing connection points on your buildings let's go this way did I it up already
[15:22.50]Yeah, I did.
[15:23.92]Don't worry about it, though.
[15:25.18]This is just for us to learn.
[15:26.42]Nothing else matters.
[15:28.72]I can go like this.
[15:36.95]Alright, that's connected.
[15:39.03]This one also needs to be connected.
[15:41.25]There it is.
[15:44.84]And we need to do our set as well.
[15:47.22]This is one little baby line.
[15:50.73]Alright.
[15:52.03]Excellent.
[15:54.01]I'm starting to remember.
[15:55.37]It's all coming back to me.
[15:56.49]Mhm.
[15:57.25]Put some nice stuff.
[16:06.06]Trees, bushes, they're gonna make up some nice stuff here.
[16:07.83]Okay, now place some ornaments around the studio.
[16:10.49]Left click to place an ornament, and right click to get rid of the one you're holding.
[16:14.91]How about one of these plates?
[16:17.03]Am I out of money?
[16:17.41]Try to use a range of different ornaments, as variety is the best way to keep the studio lot looking attractive.
[16:28.01]Okay, time to move on.
[16:30.07]Remember to place down more ornaments as the studio expands.
[16:33.58]Oh, here we go.
[16:37.36]This is better.
[16:38.50]Look at that.
[16:38.98]There we go.
[16:40.22]Looks good.
[16:41.18]Looks good.
[16:43.26]Excellent.
[16:44.06]The studio is now ready.
[16:46.39]Carry on improving things if you wish.
[16:48.47]And when you're ready, you can open the studio.
[16:50.73]I think we're ready to open.
[16:55.02]This is the casting office.
[16:56.10]This is the stage school.
[16:57.90]This is the... You hire crew.
[16:59.86]You get a director here.
[17:00.70]You create crew.
[17:02.48]I know what I'm... I think I figured it out.
[17:05.47]Let's go.
[17:06.07]I am ready to open the studio!
[17:07.53]Thank you!
[17:17.98]Oh, I need a director, and we have to make an actor, too.
[17:20.18]Okay, I need... Uh, director, lead role, crew, extras.
[17:21.74]Okay, let's do... So I need a couple actors.
[17:23.38]Who's this?
[17:23.68]Jeff Grant.
[17:23.98]I need to make my own, don't I?
[17:25.70]Can I make my own?
[17:26.50]Isn't there a way I can do that, right?
[17:28.02]Wow!
[17:47.91]Should we just put Jeff Grant in here?
[17:49.87]Alright, Jeff Grant is now an actor.
[17:55.42]There he is.
[17:55.76]Director Leo.
[17:56.50]Appropriate wannabes.
[17:57.62]How about... Jen Bolton.
[18:14.07]You can direct.
[18:17.45]Alright, so we've got Jen Bolton and we've got Jeff Grant.
[18:24.25]So we have... We're ready for... The world is ready for a comedy.
[18:29.54]The Bag Boy.
[18:30.32]I remember this shit.
[18:33.87]Bag Boy script complete.
[18:36.13]Follow the stream to the casting office where you can get your new stars to rehearse the script.
[18:40.51]Okay, your movie now needs a cast and a director.
[18:42.13]I remember this, we're gonna bring in actors.
[18:44.29]Let's start by assigning your new director.
[18:48.06]Okay, let's go.
[18:51.00]You are here.
[18:51.66]Now cast your new actor.
[18:53.74]Bag, Baggage Boy is here.
[18:55.36]Your stars have now started rehearsing the script.
[18:57.88]This will help boost the final quality of the movie.
[19:02.62]So now we need some crew, right?
[19:06.00]We need some crew.
[19:06.66]You guys can be fine.
[19:08.84]And there's no extras.
[19:09.54]Rehearsal's doing pretty well.
[19:11.32]We can speed it up.
[19:12.36]You make a script and then you put it into casting and then... Okay.
[19:15.72]Yep, I remember.
[19:33.93]I'm learning how to ride the bike again.
[19:35.33]And then you bring this over to shoot it.
[19:37.13]Now, can't we do it on our own?
[19:38.23]Oops.
[19:38.33]Oh, they're currently shooting.
[19:39.73]They're already shooting.
[20:03.17]Oh, wait, don't they tell you, like, don't you have to, like, unlock that?
[20:05.47]I'm pretty sure I have to unlock that.
[20:08.04]They're running all the way over there.
[20:13.66]Yeah, don't... The first movie always sucks.
[20:15.64]It's always just like a, hey, this is how you learn how to play the game.
[20:17.64]So they're heading for the set.
[20:20.32]There's only two people.
[20:21.19]Then he, like, lifts up barbells or something.
[20:26.51]Get in there.
[20:26.89]Here they come.
[20:41.43]The first scene is now being shot.
[20:43.95]You can see the overall movie progress in the movie's information bubbles.
[20:49.07]Yeah, you try to lift the barbell.
[20:50.97]This is the first movie ever made.
[20:57.48]Scenes that are still to be shot are displayed in the movie's shooting schedule bubble.
[21:02.50]Each scene shows which set it will be shot on.
[21:09.43]Yeah, so we're currently in, this is just three scenes, shooting the first one.
[21:13.60]Okay, now you can continue to follow the movie's progress.
[21:16.96]I didn't even do anything.
[21:19.82]In preparation for your next movie, build the new set that has become available.
[21:24.46]This will help to keep the public interested in your movies.
[21:28.45]Wild West Saloon.
[21:30.99]Put the sets back here.
[21:31.95]Okay, while the movie is shooting, it's worth looking after the rest of the studio.
[21:37.46]Look around the studio for information icons and the corresponding tips.
[21:42.02]Mm-hmm.
[21:46.36]Look for the other things in the studio.
[21:47.82]I said we've already got... This is... What is this?
[21:52.46]If you can find any job seekers, or if you have any spare staff members, try turning someone into a janitor.
[21:57.08]Yeah, here we go.
[21:58.84]Here's the janitor.
[22:00.99]Um... Casey, you're a janitor.
[22:05.31]Take care of the place.
[22:08.98]Okay, anything else that I need to remember besides the... Right, this is a game.
[22:12.92]Movie player, archive, reviews, finance.
[22:14.94]Right, remember this part.
[22:15.98]You put the movie over here.
[22:21.00]This is the crew.
[22:22.56]Here's the actors and directors.
[22:24.72]I need to make some characters.
[22:28.12]When we get out of here, we do sandbox.
[22:30.26]Then we start to actually make movies.
[22:32.65]I gotta make a few people.
[22:33.71]Alright, this one's done.
[22:42.19]Oh no, it's not.
[22:42.93]You're still shooting the same... Why am I looking at the wall?
[22:45.73]That's not me!
[22:46.90]This is done.
[22:57.56]Landscape and ornaments.
[23:03.90]Disconnect it over here.
[23:06.18]Nope, straight ahead.
[23:08.08]Alright, good.
[23:10.79]So, how- how does the first movie go?
[23:19.37]It's a damn shame this game is so hard to come by nowadays.
[23:21.63]This is- this is one of the best games ever made.
[23:23.11]Um, that is true.
[23:26.46]Unfortunately, it is hard to come by.
[23:29.36]I wish they would just re-release it somewhere, put it somewhere.
[23:32.87]I don't know why they don't do that.
[23:36.19]Who even owns the rights to this now?
[23:37.79]Microsoft?
[23:43.17]Yeah, Microsoft... Yeah, this could use a GOG release.
[23:50.15]Alright.
[23:50.67]Double left-click on an empty set for a fly-through that will show off its key features.
[23:55.65]Alright, shooting's done.
[23:58.12]But I want to take a look at it, though.
[24:02.54]Well, we are just going to watch it.
[24:03.84]Okay.
[24:04.30]Release the movie.
[24:04.94]You don't need to... Whatever.
[24:06.44]Alright.
[24:08.80]Baggage Boy is released.
[24:09.94]Script quality is awful.
[24:12.38]The movie's terrible.
[24:14.77]We get to watch it.
[24:19.51]Here we go.
[24:20.73]It's time to watch the Baggage Boy.
[24:22.41]I guarantee you he just picks up the... The dumbbell and he can't lift it and he hurts his back.
[24:28.97]Here we go.
[24:29.39]Let's take a look at that movie.
[24:40.66]Thank you.
[25:29.85]Yep, that's it.
[25:32.77]That's the whole thing.
[25:35.87]What is this part?
[25:37.07]I don't remember this part.
[25:40.21]Why am I getting, like, yelled at?
[25:41.29]It took 11 months to make this shit.
[25:50.10]Oh, wow, I didn't remember that.
[25:56.76]All events and characters in this movie are fictional.
[25:58.76]Anything similar to real people, living or dead, is a coincidence.
[26:04.83]Right, there we go.
[26:10.99]No, we're not watching that again.
[26:12.33]Okay, that was the baggage boy.
[26:16.09]Pretty good.
[26:17.63]The effect of your movie on your staff and studio.
[26:21.02]They're not that stressed out, but they made some money.
[26:24.12]It cost, uh, $10.
[26:25.98]Was that, is that 10 bucks?
[26:27.22]11 bucks.
[26:30.80]That's not 11,000.
[26:34.17]Six months to make.
[26:37.53]It's blatantly obvious that Jeff Grant doesn't have a great deal of comedy experience.
[26:42.55]Directed with a blatant disregard for quality.
[26:44.36]Grant, I didn't make it.
[26:45.86]If I made it, we would have people fucking screaming.
[26:53.16]So the movie makes money over the course of a couple years.
[26:57.75]Right.
[26:59.61]This game is so fucking good.
[27:04.69]I miss it.
[27:05.45]I'm so glad.
[27:06.01]You know what?
[27:06.37]Okay, here's the thing.
[27:07.35]You know when you don't do something for so long that you come back and it's like brand new again?
[27:11.27]That's how I feel right now.
[27:15.43]I feel like I'm glad I don't remember much from a couple years ago, whatever, two, three years ago.
[27:21.33]Oh, this is fantastic.
[27:22.27]I'm so glad that I don't remember any of this.
[27:24.84]Your studio's chart rating is based on the movies you release, the stars you employ, and the overall status of your studio.
[27:33.50]The bigger your stars, the higher your studio rating.
[27:36.48]All right, time for me to make one.
[27:38.75]I'm gonna make a little one.
[27:40.67]The better your movies, the higher your studio rating.
[27:45.66]It's not quite time to go into the sandbox mode yet.
[27:57.26]Old Rope Cinema, Pee Pants Liquid.
[27:59.36]These are the rival studios.
[28:00.82]Okay.
[28:04.54]Movie charts.
[28:07.62]Okay.
[28:09.02]Star charts.
[28:11.16]And then studios.
[28:11.82]Yeah, it just shows you how you're doing.
[28:17.51]Now that you have a movie out and some money in the bank, it's time to take a closer look at your stars and staff.
[28:25.27]Your employees need good sanitation, so place down some restrooms to improve your studio rating.
[28:31.73]Your employees need good catering provisions, too.
[28:34.25]A snack van will do for now.
[28:36.29]Great.
[28:38.89]This will raise not only your catering rating, but your overall studio rating, too.
[28:45.44]Okay.
[28:47.24]That's too convenient of a bathroom location?
[28:49.02]What do you mean?
[28:50.22]It's bad.
[28:50.60]So who the hell am I gonna make?
[29:15.56]I have to make, like, a couple of directors.
[29:17.00]I gotta make some actors.
[29:17.90]I made, like, Glue Man last time.
[29:21.31]When the mood bar goes below the lower threshold line, it will glow red.
[29:25.57]This means a star is very unhappy.
[29:27.55]Make Chuck Schnauz.
[29:28.73]You can't.
[29:29.43]You can only make, like, default characters.
[29:31.71]You can't make, like, huge noses.
[29:33.66]I could do Jax.
[29:35.28]One aspect of a star's mood is how they feel about their image.
[29:39.85]Try hovering over your stars to see how they feel.
[29:42.97]You have to work on, like, clothes and stuff.
[29:49.07]Yeah, okay.
[29:50.71]One way to improve a star's image is to give them a makeover.
[29:54.10]Give them a makeover.
[29:54.92]To do this, remember, you can rotate.
[29:56.84]You can drop builders around the sides of the building to speed up construction if you want.
[30:05.19]Use the arrows above the star icons to view your other staff types.
[30:10.08]Staff icons can be used in the same way as star icons.
[30:14.20]You can drop builders around the edges, like orcs.
[30:19.85]Okay, let's... Speaking of builders... And where are they?
[30:25.94]Make Super Jex a director.
[30:27.58]I can't.
[30:27.76]I can't make Super Jex.
[30:28.54]How am I supposed to do that?
[30:51.44]Somebody has spotted a lovely, shiny motor car on Glyth Avenue.
[30:55.56]Yeah, I can do Adam Sandler.
[30:56.84]That's easy.
[30:57.44]Okay, the makeover department is built.
[31:07.55]Pick up a star whose image you want to improve.
[31:09.88]Okay, let's go with Jeff Grant.
[31:14.79]Okay, give this star a makeover.
[31:16.71]Go to the bathroom.
[31:17.65]Follow the guiding stream to your new makeover.
[31:19.97]Go to the bathroom.
[31:20.93]The makeover department is built.
[31:23.23]No, no, no, no.
[31:24.75]Okay, give this star a makeover.
[31:26.85]Drop a star in the makeover.
[31:28.09]Is he knocking?
[31:28.77]Enter the makeover screen.
[31:32.55]Okay, I can re- Alright, I can rename.
[31:54.41]This is the 1920s.
[31:55.65]How do I take the hat off?
[32:09.07]Oh, I forgot.
[32:09.55]This is the 1920s.
[32:11.09]Nobody ever didn't have a hat on.
[32:16.04]People slept in their hats, didn't they?
[32:36.11]Okay, not bad.
[32:53.96]Just long, long-ass sideburns.
[33:08.21]No, that's fine.
[33:13.96]That's fine.
[33:14.48]This is just temporary.
[33:15.36]This is temporary, temporary, temporary.
[33:27.43]Or use the auto room if you don't mind.
[33:29.69]Using the makeover screen is a lot... No, I hate it!
[33:33.37]And gives you more control.
[33:35.00]But be careful not to choose something a star is unhappy with.
[33:37.90]Holy shit, he's about to lose his mind.
[33:44.86]Well, I guess I did just take his hair.
[33:47.18]Imagine if somebody said, hey, I'm gonna do a makeover for you.
[33:51.38]Oh, are you?
[33:52.78]Yeah, I'm actually just gonna, like, cut your hair off and fuck your whole head up and make you bald.
[33:57.31]And then put you in underwear and make you leave.
[34:00.55]Okay.
[34:06.09]Alright, I think... I think I remember mostly everything now.
[34:13.30]Until we get to the more intricate stuff with the timeline editor.
[34:17.90]But I think it'll just start to come back to me as I play.
[34:20.00]Alright, let's see if I can make another move.
[34:23.44]Play with mods?
[34:23.90]I am going to play with mods.
[34:36.15]Just not tonight.
[34:36.83]I'm going to be doing another movie stream where I literally throw up a bunch of dog shit into the boulders.
[34:42.91]I have hundreds of files that have to be installed.
[34:48.05]I have probably 125 different props and characters and costumes and shit.
[34:56.30]It's going to be out of control.
[34:59.10]Hover over one of your stars to see how they feel about their salary.
[35:03.16]If you want to give a star a raise, take them to the production office.
[35:09.10]Yeah, there's a blue screen.
[35:11.06]Yes, I'm going to be giving you guys some footage to use if you want to.
[35:15.06]All right, so let's hover into the production office.
[35:20.67]To review star salaries, place a star in the finance room in the production office.
[35:24.91]Finance room, here we go.
[35:31.80]Here, have a little bit more money.
[35:34.60]Okay, I guess I'm alright with you cutting my hair off.
[35:46.82]all right at some point your stars will begin to get bored and will need something new to do have a look at your stars information bubbles to see how bored they are if the boredom bar falls below the threshold board they are a star will become very bored which will affect their mood the bar will gradually go down when a star has no work boredom bar
[36:15.71]You're fine, you're fine, still making money, 61,000 bucks.
[36:18.16]All right.
[36:18.44]Here's our new script.
[36:19.08]Okay.
[36:37.91]Let's get you in the leading role.
[36:39.49]This movie has some minor roles that you can fill with extras.
[36:43.17]You can hire extras at the stage school.
[36:45.99]Okay.
[36:49.25]I think that's it.
[36:51.31]I think I know what I'm doing.
[36:54.08]I think it's time to actually start, like, the real game.
[36:58.00]This movie has some minor roles that you can fill with extras.
[37:01.68]You can hire extras at the stage school.
[37:05.70]So we have to go back into sandbox.
[37:10.01]This movie has some minor roles that you can fill with extras.
[37:13.23]Yeah, I just need to remember what to do.
[37:17.67]I think I'm pretty sure I got the right idea now.
[37:19.59]I just needed to do that initial tutorial to get back into the swing of things here.
[37:24.30]I'm going to save it just in case there's something I don't remember that I have to come back and remember and re-familiarize.
[37:31.20]I think that's good.
[37:37.77]Alright, let's go and do the real one.
[37:40.35]And that's, let's make, I gotta make characters first.
[37:44.57]I turned it down because it's very loud.
[37:48.57]I have to go back to the main menu.
[37:50.07]Okay, so, game.
[38:01.35]There's sandbox, but I don't, I need, it's a different window, isn't it, to make a new character?
[38:09.06]I think I have to open a separate thing.
[38:15.33]Yeah, it's a different EXE.
[38:17.91]Alright.
[38:19.29]Give me a sec.
[38:19.87]Let's get that open.
[38:21.79]Let's make the characters.
[38:24.37]So who the fuck did... This is really important, because whoever is in here... This is like who we use for the whole game.
[38:35.11]It's gonna be people we'd like to have.
[38:45.47]Okay.
[38:46.93]Let's get it open.
[38:48.15]I think you guys can see it, right?
[38:51.25]We should be able to.
[38:51.99]Okay.
[38:55.55]Star maker.
[38:56.41]Here it is.
[38:59.20]Might have to run this in a different window.
[39:03.08]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[39:08.34]Is it running?
[39:08.76]It is running in a separate window, isn't it?
[39:11.80]Alright.
[39:12.44]Here we go.
[39:17.66]Hey, look.
[39:20.60]Hey, look at that.
[39:22.72]Can you not see it?
[39:23.68]Why not?
[39:28.59]Come on, show it.
[39:29.53]Why can you not see it?
[39:36.29]Why can you not see this?
[39:40.21]Star Maker.
[39:40.89]It's showing up here.
[39:41.55]Well, this is dumb.
[39:48.92]I mean, it's clearly here.
[39:52.44]Let me try this.
[40:00.01]It's not technically a game, though.
[40:06.95]Can you see it now?
[40:12.31]That's irritating.
[40:12.99]There's one more way I can get this to work, and I just have to pull.
[40:16.87]I have to just capture the whole...
[40:20.18]Hold on.
[40:22.14]Hold on.
[40:22.64]Bear with me here.
[40:23.16]I don't know why it's not capturing.
[40:25.08]This is kind of annoying, but what the fuck just happened?
[40:28.94]Why did I lose every window?
[40:32.55]Why are computers so dumb?
[40:37.05]All right, well, hold on.
[40:38.05]This is important.
[40:43.25]Monitor capture is the only way this is going to work.
[40:45.39]There we go.
[40:52.08]Hey, look.
[40:54.02]It's a tiny little window, but you can see it at least.
[41:05.56]Boomer wallpaper?
[41:06.48]This has been the wallpaper for like a year.
[41:09.06]Yeah, so window capture didn't work, game capture didn't work, only display capture.
[41:12.26]Let's go.
[41:12.62]Actor.
[41:18.77]Let's go like this as well.
[41:25.67]Just to make it a little bit better for you.
[41:30.21]Alright, so this is Jex.
[41:35.73]Basic settings, let's do... We've got to get a good base here.
[41:46.90]That's not a bad base.
[41:52.94]Jex is not that old.
[41:59.00]It's definitely not this guy.
[42:03.34]This one's not bad.
[42:04.14]Hold on.
[42:04.66]No.
[42:05.80]Why can I not go down here?
[42:10.08]Looks?
[42:10.64]Oh, here we go.
[42:11.12]This is important.
[42:17.19]Really good action.
[42:18.85]Not that great at comedy.
[42:24.69]Eh.
[42:28.07]Stress threshold.
[42:29.53]Boredom.
[42:32.05]Food.
[42:32.67]Definitely have actions full.
[42:34.79]Trimness.
[42:37.18]Alright, we can't have him be that good looking.
[42:40.46]He's gotta be kind of... More sci-fi?
[42:44.68]No, yeah, no comedy at all.
[42:47.60]Action, horror, split this up evenly.
[42:51.12]Boredom, drink.
[42:51.92]He needs to drink all the time.
[42:53.46]Stars, drink.
[42:55.01]Addiction threshold.
[43:00.23]You don't have to be that trim.
[43:01.57]How about, uh, chest size?
[43:04.60]Actually, no, that is important.
[43:09.44]Alright, that's okay.
[43:10.38]Horror.
[43:12.60]He's, like, a little bit funny.
[43:16.20]And then mood.
[43:21.94]Hey, he's like... But Jax is not even handsome.
[43:28.55]He's not funny at all.
[43:29.97]I'm the funny one, okay?
[43:44.48]I think that's alright.
[43:48.18]Eyebrows.
[43:53.16]No eye makeup necessary.
[43:54.56]Facial hair, none.
[43:58.27]Change the hairstyle.
[44:00.23]See if we can find Jex's hairstyle.
[44:04.38]This doesn't look anything like him at all.
[44:10.42]This is Owen Wilson.
[44:30.00]Okay, this is it.
[44:31.76]I like this one.
[44:34.56]He-Man.
[44:40.00]He-Man.
[44:48.69]Lois Griffin.
[44:54.95]No, it's not Lois.
[44:55.65]Oh, it's a ponytail.
[44:56.95]I gotta change that.
[45:15.47]That's not Jex.
[45:24.18]No, it isn't.
[45:24.84]There we go, alright.
[45:33.84]He's got a different face.
[45:35.08]Okay, that's...
[45:47.60]I like it.
[45:48.12]It's staying.
[45:48.91]This is oblivion, Jex.
[46:21.80]Here we go.
[46:22.36]A little bit less.
[46:30.87]Oh, this is teeth in or teeth out?
[46:32.57]All right.
[46:41.37]Down here we got jaw.
[46:59.76]Not really that close, but I think close enough.
[47:23.09]It's the fucking hair.
[47:28.15]Can't even see the ears anyways.
[47:32.71]Looks good.
[47:46.11]Huge head?
[47:54.23]Turn on face cam.
[47:58.43]No, he's not a fucking cone head.
[48:02.79]Alright, hold on.
[48:03.21]Let me go back to the hair.
[48:04.79]The hair is just killing this.
[48:17.73]He looks like an emo singer.
[48:25.84]He's got a huge head.
[48:31.57]His head's not that huge, is it?
[48:39.31]This is John.
[48:40.25]Emo John.
[49:08.09]His head's too big.
[49:09.35]It looks ridiculous.
[49:25.78]Jesus.
[49:26.60]Alright, hold on.
[49:28.80]This is... I don't know...
[49:43.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, what just happened?
[49:45.52]Okay.
[49:46.88]No, what?
[49:51.90]Wait, how do I save this?
[49:56.37]Is he saved?
[50:04.91]Oh, save, okay.
[50:13.04]Okay, save.
[50:15.08]Load.
[50:16.84]Okay, so we can rename... We're gonna rename him.
[50:22.82]Oh, fuck.
[50:24.78]I can't rename him.
[50:28.02]Okay, it's alright.
[50:29.28]It's okay.
[50:31.39]I can rename him later.
[50:36.97]Wait, could I?
[50:41.51]Was there a rename?
[50:57.27]No, I can do it in the changed costume.
[51:05.25]Okay, create actor.
[51:18.84]Let's go, this is me.
[51:24.59]Let's get the hair right.
[51:26.98]I'm actually gonna, I'm not doing like the bald fucking head.
[51:30.94]This is, I'm gonna get my actual hair.
[51:33.69]That's pretty, that's pretty close.
[51:35.93]No, it's not, but whatever.
[51:44.44]Looks fine.
[51:57.44]That's a little extreme.
[51:58.93]Okay.
[52:17.17]My eyes are always wide open.
[52:32.94]My mouth is out a little.
[52:35.74]I'm usually pretty happy.
[52:40.48]This looks like Mark Zuckerberg.
[52:52.61]Whatever.
[52:52.99]That's like every image you've ever seen of Mark Zuckerberg's face.

[71:30.75]He's like 47.
[71:31.27]How old is Todd Howard?
[71:34.25]That's 47?
[71:36.67]That looks way older than 47.
[71:38.33]I'm close to the... Hold on.

[72:02.55]No, no I'm not.
[72:22.71]Okay, I think we're good.
[72:38.16]Like, this could be the person that you want it to be.
[72:42.92]But that's not who this is.
[72:55.40]It's not.
[73:08.37]Right in the middle is fine.
[73:30.96]That kind of looks like me.

[73:54.81]This is me.
[74:05.53]That's looking a little weird, isn't it?
[74:07.99]At least in my opinion.
[74:08.77]It's like Disney animated version of me.
[74:28.24]Let's go like this.
[74:38.25]Or, like, face scan me.
[74:43.09]What about the hair?
[74:43.98]Hopefully I can rename all these people, otherwise this is gonna be a joke.

[103:29.40]Okay.
[103:40.20]Why are there zombies in here already?
[103:41.62]Okay, so who's carrying who here?
[103:49.22]Wait, why are you carrying him?
[103:55.97]Oh, that's Jex.
[103:56.93]Okay.
[103:58.77]He looks different.
[104:00.51]Why are there people in here like this?
[104:03.94]You don't even need to be in this bathroom.
[104:07.64]Okay, so this is the...
[104:10.01]Let's go in here.
[104:10.69]Let me just see.
[104:11.93]Preparation.
[104:12.61]Into the bath.
[104:16.43]Let's just have you get in the bath.
[104:23.24]No, I'm not a porn director.
[104:24.58]Okay.
[104:25.32]Getting in the bath.
[104:26.56]I want to put the camera.
[104:29.18]Change the camera.
[104:30.60]Movie view.
[104:31.10]There we go.
[104:37.26]Alright, so that's Jax getting into the bath.
[104:41.95]Now down here we add scene, add a scene down here.
[104:46.98]Same thing, bathroom.
[104:49.26]Is there just like, just like taking a bath?
[104:53.42]Let's see, like bath, just like taking bath.
[104:55.78]Sad photo.
[105:02.54]Wait, what is bath horror?
[105:10.98]It's just already done?
[105:24.70]Who's in the mirror?
[105:25.52]There's nobody even in the mirror.
[105:30.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
[105:37.94]So why can't... There's got to be a better transitional piece here.
[105:46.00]No, let's go with... Enter hard.
[105:50.74]Let me see what we got here.
[105:57.05]No, no, no.
[105:57.53]You're already in the bath.
[105:58.57]This has to be somebody else.
[106:08.42]Why would you have somebody smoking a cigarette in here?
[106:13.25]Alright, so he gets in the bath.
[106:17.03]Does that have like a bunch of angles of him getting into the bath?
[106:19.43]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[106:22.77]Yeah, yeah.
[106:23.03]Okay, bath.
[106:29.74]Let's go bath.
[106:32.64]Bath.
[106:32.96]Enter bath.
[106:33.72]Massage.
[106:34.46]Bath.
[106:34.60]Drown.
[106:38.26]They sneak in and just drown them?
[106:40.92]Hold on, hold on.
[106:41.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[106:49.36]Wait, why would they be doing this?
[106:54.26]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[107:03.24]This has to be different people.
[107:07.12]You two come in.
[107:08.60]Why are you in different clothes?
[107:18.45]He's in different clothes!
[107:24.91]Why the fuck is his hair white?
[107:29.75]This is like the Joker.
[107:39.34]Why does his hair turn gray?
[107:42.28]Wait, who the fuck is this?
[107:43.94]No, this is Adam Sandler in here.
[107:45.56]Okay, well, that's what's going on.
[107:54.93]Okay, that makes sense, but then watch.
[107:56.79]Why does his hair change color?
[108:00.25]He comes in, and then all of a sudden now he has white hair.
[108:08.36]Why did he age, like, 30 years?
[108:13.94]Something- no, hold on.
[108:14.66]Something ain't right here.
[108:21.34]It's shampoo.
[108:22.08]Oh, I didn't- I didn't set their costumes at the start.
[108:30.83]Right, okay.
[108:32.19]Well, it's alright.
[108:34.37]We're learning again.
[108:42.64]All right.
[108:42.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[108:48.18]I need to add a couple of scenes here.
[108:49.60]Let's go static.
[108:50.38]There's nobody in the scene, but we're going to put this over here.
[109:00.55]Can I rearrange this?
[109:03.96]I can.
[109:04.34]Okay.
[109:05.48]Go static of the bathroom when he gets in.
[109:13.33]He needs to walk into the bathroom first.
[109:15.19]That's important.
[109:22.17]Here come the soldiers.
[109:23.66]Admire baby.
[109:26.10]Apply perfume.
[109:30.10]He's going to put perfume on before he goes in the bath, apparently.
[109:34.30]There's his hair again.
[109:35.12]Let's put this back this way.
[109:45.41]We need him coming in.
[109:48.51]Enter cold.
[109:56.65]I can't make this longer?
[109:59.87]I don't want you to be here.
[110:01.30]So we need to put a dummy here, right?
[110:03.56]Yeah.
[110:15.39]Okay, so this is Jax coming in.
[110:28.79]Flying perfume.
[110:35.78]Drag the actor to the hangar.
[110:38.18]Okay, right, there we go.
[110:52.35]Will he be in this the whole time, I think?
[110:53.59]Is he going to get in the bathtub with all of his clothes on?
[111:09.15]OK, hold on.
[111:16.55]Are they in the same space team?
[111:28.53]No, you don't even need to be here.
[111:30.47]No, this lady doesn't need to be here.
[111:32.97]On our trial run.
[111:33.85]Alright, now we need to... We need to have... You... There's got to be a reason why this happens.
[111:47.43]Bath horror.
[111:48.31]Bath shock.
[111:49.47]Someone is shocked by something nasty in the bath.
[112:00.41]Oh, he's shocked by him in the bath.
[112:02.65]Alright, I want to put this down.
[112:11.22]How do I move the camera down and up?
[112:12.56]I forget what the controls are for this.
[112:14.22]Because I want to put the camera in a different spot.
[112:29.29]What is it?
[112:29.73]Alt.
[112:31.15]Arrow keys.
[112:31.77]I think it's like shift and... Shift and arrow keys?
[112:35.71]Alt and the arrow keys?
[112:39.61]Shift and scroll.
[112:40.66]I know it's some combination.
[112:45.28]It's not middle mouse.
[112:47.00]W, A, S, D. No, it's... Come on, get down there.
[112:52.58]Control.
[112:55.42]Page up, page down.
[112:57.56]Damn it.
[112:59.39]Shit.
[113:00.95]Well, it's alright.
[113:01.41]I'll figure it out later.
[113:03.35]So this needs to be over here.
[113:07.54]And then have him get in the bath.
[113:10.52]Plus and minus.
[113:13.18]So he comes in.
[113:14.94]Cold.
[113:16.42]No, no, no, no, no.
[113:17.04]This is gonna be over here.
[113:23.47]It's all plus shift plus tab.
[113:26.01]Wait, what?
[113:28.64]And then he gets into the bath.
[113:34.62]So, into the bath.
[113:42.51]Bath massage.
[113:44.40]Bath horror.
[113:45.06]Bath enter.
[113:46.42]Now he's gonna get in.
[114:01.29]But I want the freeform cameras to show them like... Okay, hold on, like... I need to be able to fucking move this camera.
[114:09.48]Alright, what about here?
[114:23.70]Toggle empty parts on.
[114:28.84]And then he drowns... Then he drowns him.
[114:31.62]Alright.
[114:35.37]Let me... Let me... Give me... Okay.
[114:37.15]I think... Let's just see how this looks.
[114:44.01]Now we gotta add music and sounds and shit.
[114:48.38]Is it the number pad?
[114:49.80]No.
[114:50.54]Too bad.
[114:50.90]Alright.
[114:52.66]Alright.
[114:58.26]So now... Let me just make sure that there's nothing else I want to really do, just to test this movie.
[115:09.93]So now we have to have him, like, run away.
[115:17.36]Should we just carry him out?
[115:21.78]Walk with axe.
[115:23.40]Carry box.
[115:24.60]Jolt?
[115:26.45]Wait, an explosion!
[115:38.23]Intensity.
[115:40.21]Moderate.
[115:40.69]Duration.
[115:41.31]Short.
[115:49.30]No, I don't want that.
[115:50.70]I don't like it.
[115:52.00]We're gonna delete it.
[116:02.94]How about investigation?
[116:04.32]Prop.
[116:05.74]Bashing objects.
[116:10.80]Pick up weapon.
[116:11.66]Traveling.
[116:12.20]No.
[116:12.52]Just exit.
[116:15.60]Violence.
[116:16.18]No, no, no.
[116:24.59]Let's do... What do we have for violence?
[116:27.55]Fight.
[116:28.53]Brandish blade.
[116:29.69]Confrontation.
[116:30.41]Dead body.
[116:34.17]There's the scream spin.
[116:35.95]Death in arms.
[116:39.57]What, he drowns him and then he dies in his arm?
[116:42.71]Okay, what?
[117:01.86]When does he die?
[117:02.64]How long does it take for him to die?
[117:04.20]Someone's just brushing their teeth.
[117:07.08]Someone comes in and just starts brushing their teeth.
[117:09.71]Not kissing.
[117:11.85]Panic.
[117:12.21]Yeah.
[117:34.06]It's taking a very long time.
[117:35.70]Can I change the duration?
[117:37.56]And then he drowns him again.
[117:56.21]No, no, no.
[117:57.91]Not opposites.
[118:00.45]You need to pick him up and put him down in the bath and then drown him again.
[118:11.80]This time his hair is normal.
[118:16.42]I hate this.
[118:22.64]I need to have it cut here.
[118:33.02]You know what I'm saying?
[118:33.66]Not here.
[118:33.96]I need to have him pick him up, put him down, and have the edit bead right here.
[118:43.09]Okay.
[118:48.53]That looks good to me.
[118:50.75]Yeah, you do that in post.
[118:51.76]Yep.
[118:52.84]Alright, so then, so he needs to pick him up.
[119:00.58]Pick up weapon.
[119:01.38]No.
[119:01.64]Pick up or carry.
[119:06.04]Carry person.
[119:16.13]I don't know why there's so many random zombies.
[119:18.18]Location.
[119:18.72]We're going to go rescued, angry, dead.
[119:22.30]Okay.
[119:30.79]And then I need to put down, so this needs to be over here.
[119:35.11]He cries, then is there a pick up?
[119:40.78]Just have a zombie here?
[119:42.16]That's not going to make any sense.
[119:47.70]I need a, I need like a pick up.
[119:51.50]Is there a pick?
[119:52.20]I'm going to sneeze.
[119:59.15]Investigate.
[120:00.19]Close book.
[120:01.03]No.
[120:01.95]Someone is shocked by something.
[120:03.42]Oh.
[120:03.98]No.
[120:07.16]Read.
[120:07.64]Open book.
[120:08.20]Take photo.
[120:16.00]A group of people gather around a dead body.
[120:17.88]Find corpse.
[120:21.66]Prop focus.
[120:22.74]Gun sneak by.
[120:25.39]Murder scene.
[120:26.17]No.
[120:28.05]Is he reading on the toilet?
[120:29.27]Alright, pacing.
[120:32.59]We need pacing.
[120:33.89]Because he doesn't know what to do.
[120:35.37]So he's going to pick him up and drown him again.
[120:39.56]Duration, medium.
[120:44.16]He's a little too happy, though.
[120:48.66]I wonder, what's the solution here?
[120:59.17]Alright, put that here.
[121:00.11]Drown.
[121:06.00]Okay, then he's dead.
[121:07.86]Doesn't know what to do.
[121:09.06]Picks him up.
[121:09.72]Puts him back in the bathtub.
[121:10.94]I need a pick-up body.
[121:16.86]Enter.
[121:17.44]Horror.
[121:18.08]Exit.
[121:18.44]Carry.
[121:20.50]Enter.
[121:20.84]Carry.
[121:24.82]Mmm...
[121:30.06]Pick up weapon.
[121:36.75]Examine.
[121:37.53]Examine would probably be fine.
[121:38.81]That's right.
[121:40.01]Examine body.
[121:40.91]Let's just see what it looks like.
[121:49.49]Different wrong people, but... Look, you cut it right here.
[121:52.99]Oh, yeah.
[121:54.21]Okay, that sounds good.
[121:59.06]We could trim it so he ends up picking him up.
[122:01.38]You know, he goes down like this.
[122:04.37]And then we cut to him walking.
[122:08.91]Check out his pulse.
[122:15.39]Reaction to body.
[122:16.35]Angry.
[122:16.75]Sad.
[122:17.17]Laugh.
[122:31.75]Why is he going... No, no, no.
[122:51.44]I hate it.
[122:53.78]That's... no.
[122:56.48]We're gonna do sad.
[123:00.97]Sad works.
[123:03.19]So that is over here.
[123:06.59]So then he picks him up.
[123:10.07]All right.
[123:11.43]Drowns him again.
[123:12.13]And then runs out.
[123:18.26]I don't know why I just did warbombed street.
[123:27.74]Sniper search.
[123:35.07]Um... Sniper duel.
[123:39.03]We can do that later.
[123:41.60]No, this is good.
[123:42.34]This is good.
[123:42.74]This is good.
[123:43.12]This is done.
[123:45.50]I can edit it.
[123:46.30]I just wanna... I just... We're just doing a little one.
[123:48.22]Just to try.
[123:52.92]Get out of town.
[123:54.62]It's just a default name.
[123:58.30]Okay.
[123:58.98]Now... I bring this over to... Uh...
[124:07.06]Where do I bring this now?
[124:08.18]Over to casting?
[124:14.31]And they shoot it.
[124:17.15]But isn't it already cast?
[124:22.94]I thought I already did that.
[124:24.16]In the advanced section, no?
[124:28.80]Yeah, it is cast, so what's... I don't understand.
[124:33.30]You have to do that, I guess.
[124:34.42]Let me see.
[124:38.29]Alright, no, it is.
[124:39.19]So we just need some extras.
[124:40.65]What do you mean, extras?
[124:51.28]Who's an extra in this?
[124:55.58]Why would there be an extra?
[125:04.07]How do I get an extra in here?
[125:08.46]I don't know who this is.
[125:14.55]Writers needed.
[125:15.33]There's no one writing the script.
[125:20.57]Shoot it.
[125:24.05]Okay, this should be done.
[125:25.01]I have instant movie making, right?
[125:33.87]Where the hell did... Where is it at?
[125:38.52]Alright, so now... I take this... into, uh... what do I take this into?
[125:48.93]I take it into, like, the Advanced Movie Maker, right?
[125:54.01]I actually don't think I have it.
[125:57.80]Post-production, there it is.
[126:02.10]Do I not have one of these?
[126:02.96]I thought I did.
[126:14.98]Post-production, here we go.
[126:16.64]Welcome to post-production where you can edit and enhance your movies in a variety of ways.
[126:22.30]You can also export your movies as files that you can then send to your friends or post online.
[126:29.47]It's time, it's time to make the donuts.
[126:33.43]So, let's open up the Art of War is the song.
[126:45.28]No, it ain't gonna be the art of war.
[126:51.04]How do I remove that?
[126:51.88]Just delete it.
[126:53.50]Alright, let's get a song here.
[126:54.94]No, I'm not gonna do acid bass.
[127:02.97]How's this one?
[127:10.05]No.
[127:14.81]How about, uh, Armageddon Advancing Army?
[127:19.98]How's about that?
[127:21.90]It's essentially the same title as the movie.
[127:28.22]Alright, I don't, I like it.
[127:33.98]Let's put the volume down a little bit.
[127:36.26]Uh, I want something, I want a better title in here.
[127:38.22]I want to add a title.
[127:42.18]Because I don't like this one.
[127:45.21]Lion Head movies.
[127:46.25]No, no, no.
[127:48.27]How do we edit this title?
[127:49.49]I think we can add it later, maybe?
[127:57.15]ABC.
[127:57.75]Oh yeah, I can record voiceover on this too.
[128:00.74]Alright, let's see here.
[128:06.86]So this starts out like this.
[128:14.08]Static?
[128:14.66]Hold on, it's because he comes in with him.
[128:19.52]Didn't I... Is this the extra?
[128:25.71]It's so fast.
[128:28.53]Okay, so... Okay, all right, all right.
[128:36.44]Now I know where the extra is, and I can't remove him.
[128:38.36]It's already been filmed.
[128:41.38]Why does he put perfume on?
[128:46.17]Okay, so we need some sound here.
[128:48.69]We need like a... Okay, how about right here?
[128:55.69]Let's have... Bed squeak?
[129:01.03]Door open, metal bang, metal creak.
[129:04.41]Whistle police?
[129:05.50]What is whistle police?
[129:06.50]That's... no.
[129:23.60]human cells.
[129:24.16]It has to be like, mm-hmm.
[129:27.99]Oh, I have a cough.
[129:38.27]And then he gets in the bath.
[129:53.88]He comes in way too fast.
[129:55.20]Okay.
[129:55.58]Now we need like a... We need like a... Ow!
[130:05.43]Hey, it's hot.
[130:10.29]Scream.
[130:10.91]Is there a way you can hear them?
[130:15.11]I thought there was.
[130:16.59]Why don't I just make the noise?
[130:17.89]Ah!
[130:24.65]Okay, so... It's too hot!
[130:29.63]Alright, do we need to scream here?
[130:31.05]So, like, right here?
[130:48.73]That's good.
[130:50.31]And then we need, like, an...
[131:03.89]This is probably fine.
[131:11.99]That's not what I thought it was going to be.
[131:13.43]It's just one grunt.
[131:15.43]Wait.
[131:17.69]It's because the camera.
[131:25.19]I wanted to have the camera.
[131:34.06]Can I not?
[131:34.72]How do I make the camera stay?
[131:37.88]That's very important.
[131:44.46]He's going to scream a couple times too.
[131:50.90]It's not a porn game.
[131:52.20]Alright, hold on.
[132:04.85]No, no, no, no, no.
[132:05.77]It's going to be like a... Applause, no.
[132:10.20]Belch, no.
[132:10.98]Cough.
[132:12.18]He does kind of like cough a little.
[132:14.18]Like right here.
[132:15.32]He turns over.
[132:16.24]He turns his head over.
[132:17.14]And then we need... Ah!
[132:20.42]Ah!
[132:36.75]Scream one.
[132:40.34]Scream two.
[132:46.60]Sniff.
[133:06.42]Okay.
[133:10.35]Big slurp.
[133:12.07]This looks good.
[133:13.31]And then we need like... Breathe heavy.
[133:50.26]This goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
[134:35.50]I can't put a fart sound in here.
[134:37.72]That's so easy.
[134:38.90]We need to have like coughing.
[135:10.67]He's like... This is so awful.
[135:12.67]He's swallowing so much water that he's just like... He's not even burps.
[135:20.48]Ugh.
[135:42.94]This is fucking horrible.
[135:45.54]No, we need more coughs.
[135:49.44]This burp sucks.
[135:53.50]Ugh.
[136:15.15]I'm only going to put this in temporarily because people are demanding it.
[136:48.30]No.
[136:49.46]No, no.
[136:50.33]It's not.
[136:51.03]It's so stupid.
[136:53.45]I don't know if I can have it.
[137:09.16]You guys realize I have to do this again, right?
[137:11.91]This happens another time.
[137:29.13]Fuck this.
[137:30.37]The little shake.
[137:33.31]It's like right here.
[137:55.76]no but if he smells here then I uh no I this is this changes everything no it can't be like this
[138:57.82]Come on, don't start lagging on me now.
[139:19.95]Back here, back here, back here.
[139:32.14]It's got to be more frequent.
[139:37.34]It's supposed to be smelling the perfume and not the... Is it going to copy these?
[139:56.58]Is there a way I can just copy?
[140:08.48]I hate that This is fucked up
[140:41.62]This is like getting borderline not safe for work.
[140:44.53]Alright, then what happens is he picks up... Okay, right here.
[141:04.32]He dies!
[141:07.98]I don't even need this scene!
[141:09.62]This whole scene doesn't even need to exist!
[141:15.73]This whole scene doesn't need to exist.
[141:31.80]Because I want to cut this portion.
[141:33.92]How do I do that?
[141:36.06]Is there like a scissor?
[141:36.98]There it is.
[141:38.53]Audio options.
[141:39.29]Yeah, that's fine.
[141:41.37]Here it is.
[141:42.35]Split scene.
[141:48.30]Because I want him to pick them up, like, here.
[141:53.73]Right at the edge there.
[141:58.09]Like, right there.
[142:02.24]Like, right here.
[142:07.06]We can get rid of these.
[142:07.86]Oops, oops, oops, oops, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
[142:16.75]Okay, now I should be able just to drag this into here.
[142:21.75]Yes.
[142:23.32]Delete this.
[142:28.12]Yes.
[142:31.26]And that's him picked now.
[142:32.22]He lifts his head up.
[142:39.31]Let's put the C in here.
[142:57.48]And then he needs to put him back down.
[143:02.20]And then down.
[143:06.44]So right here.
[143:10.00]Right here.
[143:24.59]Why is he out of the tub though?
[143:30.64]This whole scene, I'm getting rid of this one.
[143:32.76]It doesn't even need to be here.
[143:40.66]We're changing the music, too.
[143:45.96]What?
[143:52.03]Oh, it's because... Oh, shit.
[143:55.35]The timeline changed.
[143:56.69]How do I... Can I put them all together?
[144:01.98]Why did that happen?
[144:04.26]I didn't move these.
[144:07.90]The timeline changed down here because I edited... Okay, you gotta edit that shit up top first.
[144:14.91]It's alright, I can just move it forward.
[144:17.01]This is the cough, right?
[144:19.67]Yeah, just move everything forward.
[144:31.99]That cough is right here.
[144:42.06]A little bit more, and then he gets in the bathtub.
[144:45.94]Ah!
[144:48.32]Ah!
[144:53.51]Ah!
[145:01.12]Right there.
[145:01.60]Alright, that's a good spot.
[145:04.18]What?
[145:04.60]Who's crying?
[145:07.68]Why is there somebody crying?
[145:10.92]Oh, he cries.
[145:11.30]He does.
[145:12.20]It's him.
[145:31.75]He cries, like, right here.
[145:34.83]This music's gonna drive me fucking crazy.
[145:45.12]Hey!
[146:30.89]It's not even funny.
[146:32.76]But I don't know why I laugh at it every time.
[146:34.80]It's not even funny.
[147:00.73]All right, we need a little bit more.
[147:03.61]We need the music to change right here.
[147:05.21]What was that?
[147:05.74]Did you hear that?
[147:06.54]What was that?
[147:07.00]There's like 20 people screaming.
[147:39.00]Right here.
[147:40.42]Music changes.
[148:04.34]And... Right on.
[148:08.08]Okay, here's...
[148:34.90]this one needs to be changed and then this one changes too like that right right here all right we gotta add a couple more screams I can't this is the only fart that's gonna be in the entire stream by the way
[149:12.04]There's not going to be any more farts.
[149:14.06]I can promise you that.
[149:26.13]Okay, I need a couple more coughs.
[149:34.17]Ah!
[149:34.63]Ah!
[150:00.67]I fucking want to remove it so bad!
[150:16.27]I need one more cough.
[150:31.84]What does slurp sound like?
[150:33.02]No, that's not gonna work.
[150:40.38]Getting rid of this.
[150:46.71]What?
[150:47.21]Bullet?
[150:51.15]It's like a Call of Duty hit sound.
[150:52.45]Okay.
[150:52.73]Alright, last.
[151:00.34]I need to cough.
[151:01.18]One more cough.
[151:08.24]Like right here.
[151:15.95]Do a bubble noise after the fart.
[151:19.08]Oh my god.
[151:20.00]What if we just dropped a fucking huge dump in here?
[151:50.02]Splash bath?
[151:58.80]Okay, we need to get... the song has to start playing again.
[152:14.15]I think actually... no, hold on.
[152:35.29]What?
[153:00.55]No, I'm sorry guys.
[153:01.57]This is not going to be like a dump.
[153:03.77]That's like TOS.
[153:05.22]I'm not going to get like dumped.
[153:55.49]I need to cut this track here.
[154:00.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[154:01.31]Undo, undo, undo.
[154:02.27]That's not what I wanted to do.
[154:04.97]Is there an undo button?
[154:09.57]I think there is.
[154:12.43]Where is it?
[154:15.53]Control Z, will it work?
[154:18.29]No, there is no undo.
[154:21.86]Gotta beware that there is no undo.
[154:29.98]So how do I make this smaller?
[154:33.05]How do I get rid of that?
[154:44.57]Toggle mumbly, that they can like be mumbling.
[154:47.36]Top left, that's exit.
[154:51.92]Do you want to click the exit button and waste the last like 45 minutes in this dumb movie?
[155:01.73]I think I can do no sound, right?
[155:03.75]Wasn't there a track that's like no, like kill the audio?
[155:05.85]I think there is one.
[155:11.96]Isn't there like a, how do I get rid of that?
[155:19.24]Because I can't.
[155:27.23]Yeah, I can't like drag, like click and drag.
[155:31.18]This has got to be something right.
[155:35.72]I don't think so.
[155:41.66]I can adjust the volume on the whole, on the master.
[155:47.24]Yeah, right click doesn't do anything.
[155:48.34]The scissor just cuts, but hold on.
[155:51.36]Do it.
[155:54.61]No, no, no, no.
[156:02.25]Just cut the clip and remove the end part.
[156:03.93]Yeah, that's what I was trying to do, but I can't... I can't cut the clip.
[156:12.36]For some reason, when I click here, it cuts the video track.
[156:19.34]That's what I thought, right?
[156:20.32]Split scene.
[156:21.43]It's just splitting the scene.
[156:22.69]Hmm.
[156:29.27]It's all right.
[156:33.75]There should be more than one audio channel.
[156:35.21]Yeah, it's not as advanced as you might think.
[156:40.38]Save the game, save the game.
[156:41.74]I will, I will.
[156:43.08]We're good.
[156:43.92]Hold on, hold on.
[156:49.93]No, this is fine.
[156:50.73]It doesn't matter.
[156:51.85]All right, we got it.
[156:57.53]It's all right.
[156:57.99]We can just have the music played over again.
[157:03.57]I'm not doing all that again.
[157:05.92]I'm just going to do some coughs.
[157:07.48]We've got to export this shit.
[157:09.62]Wait, what?
[157:18.17]Wait, what happened to the... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[157:19.75]What happened to the video files that were back here?
[157:23.02]What happened?
[157:39.81]What I do?
[157:40.75]Oh, I'm okay.
[157:41.39]Okay first.
[157:41.97]I'm all the way back here now All right, here we go I wish I could just copy all these and put them over here, but I can't so here's what we're gonna do Let's happen, let's see
[158:26.73]Now I'm yawning.
[158:27.71]Now I'm gonna yawn too.
[158:32.42]How is that a yawn?
[158:33.84]That's a yawn, apparently.
[158:35.38]Bleh!
[159:02.09]Nope, that don't fit.
[159:31.79]Here we go again.
[159:33.49]Here we go again.
[159:34.21]Okay.
[159:48.10]Where is it?
[159:50.19]Belch.
[160:32.96]Okay.
[160:34.61]Put comedy music in the browning.
[161:02.87]It's... Every movie I make in here has the same repeat the scene thing.
[161:37.13]He's like breaking his neck.
[161:42.85]Oh, God.
[162:17.23]Oh my god.
[162:18.33]Okay.
[162:22.26]Should I change my stream to like 18 and over?
[162:50.55]Well, now I need to.
[162:51.67]All right, let me get... Hold on.
[163:08.68]Beauty like no other leads into... Get this out of here.
[163:29.85]Alright, I'm actually going to remove this because we don't need it anymore.
[163:32.47]Nooooooooooo!
[163:36.97]The timeline does that thing!
[163:38.59]Ah, shit.
[163:44.08]Why does it do that?
[163:50.12]Oh, that sucks.
[163:51.06]That whole thing gets ruined down here.
[163:52.84]I don't remember that happening.
[163:56.14]There is no undo.
[164:02.48]That has to be an undo.
[164:08.76]Right?
[164:09.06]Like, that has to be.
[164:16.55]No, Control-Z doesn't do anything.
[164:25.47]Shit, really?
[164:26.82]That sucks that it does that.
[164:35.29]I'm not gonna click the exit button.
[164:37.53]Ah, I gotta like burn that into my brain.
[164:39.89]That if you change anything up here, it shrinks the whole, every single timeline.
[164:45.37]You can map and undo key.
[164:50.76]Delete.
[164:51.96]Thumbnail.
[164:53.06]Split.
[164:53.42]Like, why are these grayed out?
[164:55.82]What is this?
[164:57.24]Fade out.
[164:57.80]Oh, fade out and fade in.
[164:58.72]That sucks.
[165:01.62]That sucks.
[165:09.86]I haven't unlocked the undo.
[165:13.54]Well, hold on.
[165:16.08]And that's the end of the movie.
[165:20.47]Watch the undo tutorial.
[165:24.21]I wonder.
[165:27.17]Deleting scenes, cutting scenes, moving scenes.
[165:31.05]No, I don't think that's going to do it.
[165:35.65]Yeah, I have to, what I'm gonna have to burn into my memory is trim everything, get everything the way that I want it first, completely, and then do sound effects.
[165:42.96]So, just, I'm gonna have to go for it here.
[165:46.20]Just have to move everything, like, an inch forward.
[165:55.65]And then that's it.
[166:02.47]Ah!
[166:08.41]What a pain in the ass.
[166:13.09]I wish they would remake this game and put all the quality of life features that it deserves.
[166:21.18]Can I move the whole timeline?
[166:31.73]I don't think so, no.
[166:33.19]When you click in the timeline, you just add a sound.
[166:38.40]Yeah, save every- before you do everything.
[166:42.40]Yeah, it is a learning process.
[166:44.12]Yeah, the whole thing just has to go forward, again!
[166:49.01]Ugh!
[166:49.09]Goddammit.
[166:51.31]No!
[166:51.55]No!
[167:08.12]Checking I have control in the undo.
[167:09.70]I'm scared to hit escape.
[167:13.01]No, I can't go anywhere.
[167:14.51]I don't have any options or anything.
[167:29.58]Trying to lead the game.
[167:38.57]Oh, I had them in a perfect spot too!
[167:45.49]God, somebody buy the rights to this, so we can get a better version.
[167:48.61]Oh.
[168:10.97]Ask Bill Gates.
[168:18.65]I keep forgetting that's in here.
[168:25.55]Who's coughing?
[168:26.64]Oh, he is.
[168:39.58]Okay, so now let's see what this... That moves over here, that moves over here.
[168:47.34]Alright, almost done.
[169:04.06]Nah, and I cannot bunch them together either, unfortunately.
[169:07.46]I can't, like, hit shift and... or control or alt.
[169:11.77]You have to do it individually.
[169:13.41]Yeah, the music is overlapping, but I don't think I can do anything about it.
[169:24.57]How did I do this last time?
[169:37.43]Hey!
[170:23.59]This is nothing but fart and burp jokes.
[170:25.67]I know.
[170:26.59]Everybody pre-oppressed me in doing this.
[170:33.24]I'm sorry.
[170:35.18]And you wouldn't have to see it so many times if I didn't have to do this stupid shit with the no undo button.
[170:49.84]Get in closer.
[171:04.40]I'm done.
[171:15.67]I'm done.
[171:16.07]I'm done.
[171:16.77]I'm done.
[171:17.11]I'm out of this.
[171:17.73]We're gone.
[171:36.63]These have to be moved a little bit.
[171:47.29]Okay.
[171:54.90]This goes forward, this goes forward, this goes forward.
[171:57.34]We're ready!
[171:58.22]Export!
[172:04.24]What?
[172:33.86]Goodbye.
[172:35.40]Save the stupid movie.
[172:37.18]Save.
[172:38.06]It's saved.
[172:38.62]It's done.
[172:39.06]It's over.
[172:41.00]It's time to export this piece of shit.
[173:30.90]Oh, waste!
[173:32.06]He comes back to life again?
[173:33.12]Alright, that's it.
[173:47.59]I'm done.
[173:49.91]I had to export the movie.
[174:07.48]That looks good.
[174:12.86]Bottom right.
[174:15.28]Yeah, export movie.
[174:16.60]How do I get rid of all this?
[174:18.94]There's gotta be a way I can cut that.
[174:20.28]I just don't know.
[174:20.94]Alright, export movie.
[174:25.49]If you want to have audio in your exported movie, you must first update the soundtrack by playing the movie from start to finish.
[174:30.71]Do you want to do this now?
[175:08.32]Ah!
[175:09.30]Ah!
[175:11.18]Ah!
[175:43.25]All right.
[176:13.92]Ugh.
[176:44.58]Oh, God.
[177:24.49]Hey, I remember how to play the... I remember how to use the controls now.
[177:32.31]Can I export the fucking movie now, please?
[177:38.59]I already did that.
[177:39.45]What are you talking about?
[177:45.62]Wait, what?
[177:49.24]Output name, high, highest.
[177:51.38]Wait, what is this talking about?
[177:57.94]Is this gonna just save it to my computer?
[178:02.20]I'm so confused.
[178:04.82]Yeah, highest.
[178:09.39]Oh my god, my, like, fucking stomach hurts.
[178:13.29]It was like when he snaps his neck, like, twice.
[178:15.45]It's just, like, so awful.
[178:18.01]It's unnecessary.
[178:20.52]Alright, let's just get out of town.
[178:26.14]Ugh.
[178:30.28]It has like a vignette all over it too.
[178:39.06]I actually am physically exporting this.
[178:52.29]Alright, now we're going to make...
[178:54.59]I saw it in the chat earlier and it is the thing that I want to make.
[178:58.53]We're going to make constant conflict.
[179:01.13]That is what I thought to make.
[179:16.04]I do want to figure out a couple of things though.
[179:20.30]Mainly free camera stuff.
[179:24.03]Well, alright, it's been uploaded.
[179:27.13]Save it.
[179:29.09]And that's it, right?
[179:31.53]Is this now all edited together?
[179:34.69]I think it is.
[179:35.21]So I just release it now.
[179:40.15]Ready for release.
[179:42.44]Let's see what they say.
[179:52.32]Crypt quality is not very good.
[179:54.36]It's alright.
[179:58.00]I don't even want to watch it again.
[179:59.12]I'm not gonna... I don't want to watch it again.
[180:01.24]I don't want to watch it again.
[180:29.19]We've already seen it!
[180:30.13]Yeah, we've already seen it.
[180:33.23]We don't need to watch it a sixth time.
[180:35.17]The crew was clueless, inexperienced cretins.
[180:59.34]The overall quality of acting in this movie is appalling.
[181:02.64]Howard's poor direction didn't do this movie any favors.
[181:05.08]Leo was shockingly bad.
[181:15.32]Making money, though.
[181:15.96]That's all that matters.
[181:16.56]How do you can this?
[181:21.20]Because it's just kind of sitting here.
[181:24.76]How do I... How do I just like get rid of this?
[181:27.42]It's gotta be like a throw... Call it.
[181:29.68]Can it.
[181:30.06]There we go.
[181:33.80]Alright.
[181:34.60]Let's do... Let's do another one.
[181:39.24]This one's gonna be a little bit more... Elaborate.
[181:41.92]We need some more sets.
[181:44.44]Let's do... Cellar.
[181:51.15]War.
[181:51.53]Battle.
[181:51.79]It's gonna be a battlefield.
[181:54.97]Constant conflict.
[181:55.92]What is this?
[182:01.22]Let's do... Living room.
[182:11.79]Gonna need an office.
[182:17.19]Gonna need... Traveling vehicle.
[182:22.25]Automobile.
[182:31.53]Uh, Wild West Desert, Wild West Jail.
[182:33.96]I already have the war battlefield in the street.
[182:40.28]I already have the bathroom.
[182:45.23]And year, a couple years do, we have, time does have to pass.
[182:48.01]Let's get the desert in here too, probably gonna need it somehow.
[183:02.56]Alright, so... We need... We're going to start in the house.
[183:08.98]So, constant conflict is going to start opening in a... There's just a regular group of friends.
[183:15.08]Remember what happens in the middle... In the beginning of Cloverfield?
[183:19.16]Where it's just like, holy shit, something's going down.
[183:21.65]It's going to start here.
[183:24.13]There's going to be like an earthquake, and they're going to investigate the earthquake, and it's going to be like there's fucking aliens invading, and then they all have to have scars on their faces.
[183:34.54]Okay, what else do I need?
[183:35.36]Anything else?
[183:39.06]Uh, the bank?
[183:41.38]Maybe just like a... just have them all.
[183:49.09]And... jail... street.
[183:52.77]Sci-Fi Starbridge.
[183:54.61]Make an E3 conference.
[184:05.26]I mean, could.
[184:06.60]Seller, alright.
[184:07.68]I think we can work with this.
[184:10.18]Make an E3 conference.
[184:12.92]You... Do you want me to make a... Constant conflict is probably going to take, like, the next two and a half hours.
[184:22.42]I need, like, the blue screen.
[184:24.48]We need time to go by.
[184:25.50]Because you can't start any... Why couldn't I... I wish I could start in, like, 2000.
[184:38.32]Alright, I'll use my voice, too.
[184:41.19]We'll show some, like... No, no, no, no, no, the game is... Constant Conflict is the game that they're showing with E3.
[184:52.44]That makes sense, doesn't it?
[184:55.32]But I need... I know there's a blue screen, but... I don't think I have it yet.
[185:01.48]We're not in, like, the... We're in, like, the 50s.
[185:06.69]You can edit the INI file to start in, like, 2000.
[185:12.79]Okay.
[185:14.61]Yeah, I'll fast forward it.
[185:20.62]Uh, let me save it here, and then I'm gonna... Let me save game.
[185:25.56]Let's just call it... Pee Pants, because that's the name of the studio.
[185:29.71]Uh, I'm gonna edit the INI, so we can actually be in the year 2000.
[185:36.91]And then... Yeah, I'll bind Undo as well.
[185:39.78]I gotta pee.
[185:40.74]So, I spent three hours.
[185:42.28]I haven't gone to the bathroom.
[185:43.36]I'll be right back.
[185:45.78]And then when you come back... There will be... A, uh... The year 2000.
[185:54.80]Blue screen.
[185:55.52]Green screen.
[185:56.78]Constant conflict.
[185:58.36]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[190:08.43]Okay, give me just a sec.
[190:11.57]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[190:14.33]Easy, easy, easy.
[190:18.49]Okay, INI file.
[190:22.51]Let's get that open.
[190:24.76]I got some water, too.
[190:27.10]I'm thirsty.
[190:30.88]Okay, where do I do this?
[190:33.20]I remember it's in a weird spot, isn't it?
[190:45.25]Look for unlocking INI.
[190:49.15]Unlocking INI.
[190:56.46]Hmm.
[190:58.72]Where the hell is that?
[191:02.28]Let me see.
[191:03.12]I gotta like look it up.
[191:08.99]It's not here.
[191:15.37]Data, scenario, scenes, text.
[191:22.84]Where the hell is this?
[191:41.57]I think it's the registry.
[191:43.11]I think I can do it in the registry.
[191:56.45]Yeah, I could allow any decade and change the value to one.
[192:01.18]Let's hope this doesn't break.
[192:02.36]Or is it in my documents file?
[192:12.98]No, would that work?
[192:13.82]Let's see.
[192:15.92]I don't think, no, maybe it is right here.
[192:17.34]All right, hold on.
[192:19.61]I have get out of town here.
[192:30.40]It's not here.
[192:36.69]I can't really go searching for this right now.
[192:40.57]I definitely have enough to do what I want to do.
[192:43.09]At least for... Let me see.
[192:49.43]Anybody offhand have any idea where this is?
[192:54.44]Because I don't see it anywhere.
[192:56.46]Or do I have to make one?
[192:58.04]With a text document, you know what I'm saying?
[193:02.39]It's in the documents.
[193:03.47]I'm in my documents right now, the movies, and I don't see anything.
[193:07.11]I see save games, movie sounds, graphics.
[193:17.86]Maybe an app data?
[193:19.00]That's possible, hold on.
[193:28.97]There's Lionhead, the movies.
[193:31.91]There's an OS detect.
[193:35.20]This is not an INI.
[193:37.88]Shit.
[193:44.76]I'm in AppData right now and there's no Linehead Studios in AppData roaming.
[194:00.85]Yeah, it's not in here.
[194:02.10]Is it hidden?
[194:10.18]I've got an unlocking.ini there for me.
[194:14.29]Well, how come I don't have one?
[194:23.09]Hold on.
[194:23.54]Let me see if I can.
[194:26.68]Is it hidden?
[194:34.35]Maybe it's a hidden file.
[194:38.77]It's not a hidden file for me.
[194:41.39]Show hidden files in folders.
[194:43.05]Where the fuck is it then?
[194:47.50]Yeah, I have hidden files showing right now.
[194:59.56]I'm going to have to get this done off stream because it's not here.
[195:06.21]Once I unload all the mods on the next stream for this game.
[195:15.89]Either that or I have to edit the registry and I feel like I'll break the fucking whole game.
[195:25.82]It's a hidden file in AppData.
[195:27.54]That's where I am right now.
[195:29.40]I have... I'm in AppData.
[195:32.33]I'm in Lionhead Studios.
[195:34.17]And the only thing that's there with hidden files turned on is this file that says OS detect.
[195:42.07]That's it.
[195:45.03]Well, I'll try the registry thing, but I might have to remake the whole game.
[195:48.42]Let's see.
[195:51.58]I'll do the registry.
[195:53.82]If this doesn't work, then I'll have to get it done for when we put the mods in.
[196:01.09]Alright.
[196:01.87]It is in.
[196:03.05]I'm there in the movies.
[196:09.57]Allow any decade.
[196:11.35]It is about to be turned into one.
[196:13.77]The value is one.
[196:19.04]Let's see if that worked.
[196:22.02]If I have to start a new game, I might have to.
[196:27.10]Because I think I have to pick the decade.
[196:29.40]Unfortunately.
[196:31.80]Let's give it a try.
[196:46.45]Alright, here we go.
[196:49.03]Let's see if it works.
[196:57.67]Set it to 2.
[196:59.49]And break everything.
[197:05.67]Okay.
[197:14.82]Yeah, I'm going to have to... I think I'm going to have to do another one.
[197:18.06]Because, see, watch this.
[197:19.20]Ready?
[197:21.33]Yeah.
[197:22.75]I have to start another one.
[197:26.82]Unfortunately, we have to.
[197:27.98]It's alright, though.
[197:34.89]That's not any time at all.
[197:40.17]I have the same actors and everything, so don't worry.
[197:45.68]Um... They can misbehave.
[197:47.26]That's fine.
[198:01.75]A hundred million dollars, that's right.
[198:13.17]Alright, just gotta bring everybody back.
[198:17.05]Alright, let's go.
[198:17.75]I need a import.
[198:24.50]Bring them all back in.
[198:33.02]Sandler.
[198:35.97]Somebody has to be a director, right?
[198:40.43]And I need import star.
[198:42.55]I need another... Who else?
[198:45.89]Who's the director?
[198:47.62]For you.
[198:54.06]No sound?
[198:54.54]Sorry.
[198:55.04]I had to mute it.
[199:03.44]Alright, we got a director.
[199:04.38]We have our actors.
[199:06.82]Let's go.
[199:09.12]Dead Out of Town's on YouTube already.
[199:12.13]How the hell did you do it that fast?
[199:15.69]So now, look at this.
[199:17.43]There we are.
[199:20.87]Field.
[199:21.55]Graveyard.
[199:22.25]Must be sa- Alien world.
[199:25.56]Stage.
[199:28.22]Suburban bathroom.
[199:29.14]Suburban living room.
[199:31.64]Alright, so suburban living room.
[199:34.05]Suburban living room.
[199:41.97]My first movie was pirated instantly.
[199:50.65]Alien world.
[199:58.14]Let's get Stage for our E3 presentation.
[200:01.44]Stage, I believe you can put a green screen behind it.
[200:07.51]Suburban Street is another one.
[200:12.09]You have to have, like, the chaos.
[200:15.85]And then we need only a few more things.
[200:21.32]Tropical Beach, why not?
[200:32.99]Uh, alleyway, bar.
[200:34.60]Yeah, we want a bar.
[200:36.28]I want a lot of things.
[200:37.56]I want everything.
[200:41.92]Rooftop.
[200:44.76]For the inevitable chase scene.
[200:49.14]Uh, subway carriage, hotel room.
[200:53.48]Subway station.
[200:55.99]There's a lot of sets.
[200:58.09]We got unlimited money, though, so it doesn't matter.
[201:05.32]battlefield.
[201:06.22]We need this, too.
[201:07.80]When we fight the aliens.
[201:08.78]Yeah, I'm really going big here, but you know what's gonna happen.
[201:13.65]There's gonna be, like, a fucking neck snap and then a fart sound.
[201:17.25]And then somebody, like, falls down or something.
[201:18.99]You think this is gonna be a big, elaborate movie.
[201:24.10]I'm out of space.
[201:25.46]I have to, like, move shit around.
[201:27.44]Hold on.
[201:30.70]Move rehab out of the way.
[201:37.22]I think I need, like, a builder.
[201:38.74]No, this is good.
[201:39.58]This is good.
[201:40.02]This is good.
[201:41.14]There's plenty.
[201:42.58]I got, like, the alien world.
[201:44.07]I've got... I can't fit that right here.
[201:48.55]Okay.
[201:48.87]Okay, good.
[201:50.03]One more.
[202:03.46]Shit.
[202:04.76]This is alright.
[202:05.40]No, that's good.
[202:05.78]That's good.
[202:06.06]That's fine.
[202:06.38]That's fine.
[202:07.20]Just get rid of the rehab.
[202:15.01]No, this is alright.
[202:15.57]This is alright.
[202:18.43]Okay.
[202:19.45]Here we go.
[202:20.51]Custom script.
[202:22.88]I need the custom script office.
[202:24.26]I also need a post-production office.
[202:32.55]No, I already have one.
[202:33.60]Okay.
[202:36.66]Here we go.
[202:39.08]It's time.
[202:43.88]The name of this movie... This is an action movie?
[202:51.30]Well, actually, it's... I don't know.
[202:52.88]This is E3.
[202:59.51]It would be an action movie, right?
[203:10.09]OK, we need to have the person presenting.
[203:20.20]Let's have this be Adam Sandler.
[203:26.43]So we need to change this to a better outfit.
[203:38.81]No, that's not, this is better.
[203:41.77]It comes out in thin stripes.
[203:45.13]I like that a little better.
[203:46.11]No, no, no latex heads.
[204:08.75]This is fine.
[204:09.49]No, no, this is fine.
[204:14.14]This is just a suit.
[204:17.04]Eye makeup shape.
[204:19.62]Facial hair.
[204:20.62]All right, this is fine.
[204:29.07]And then this is...
[204:37.72]Commander, um... We gotta have a story here.
[204:42.68]We have... No, no, no.
[204:48.67]The studio head is the person that's presenting Ys III.
[204:51.25]We have to have a main character.
[204:52.57]Two games are shown.
[204:55.95]Leo as... Captain... Or, like, Grunge... What's a hard name?
[205:10.36]Like, Rick Grunge or something.
[205:16.60]No, no, no, no.
[205:17.52]Um... Rock, like... Rock Hard... Rock Hardman?

[206:23.40]Like, no.
[206:24.10]No, no, no.
[206:24.64]No Rock.
[206:50.45]How about... I'm not going to... No, not that one.
[207:00.79]Kurt... Kurt Freitner?
[207:04.61]Kurt Freitner.
[207:09.17]Commander Kurt Freitner.
[207:15.88]Yeah, that's going to be... That's going to be Jaxx.
[207:23.70]We also need an alien, but I think we can have some extras be aliens, right?
[207:34.87]So we've got Jex, and I'm saying that Leo can be here.
[207:41.70]Also, we need to change your costume, because that's not what you're going to be wearing.
[207:48.92]It's going to be in...
[207:51.23]One of these outfits that looks cool.
[207:53.82]Not a clown costume.
[207:56.08]Sorry guys.
[207:56.70]Is he just like a cop?
[208:04.73]No, is there- is it like a marine?
[208:06.31]Like a space marine?
[208:22.34]Invincible ghost?
[208:29.48]Here we go.
[208:30.22]This is not bad.
[208:33.30]No, but this is just like his day as the Space Marine Commander or something.
[208:41.09]Space suit.
[208:43.77]Okay, so that's alright.
[208:47.35]That's a good starting costume.
[208:50.62]Swedish.
[208:52.57]Swedish space marine.
[208:56.01]And then this has to be an alien of some sort.
[209:03.26]Okay, let's go with back here.
[209:05.60]I do like monsters, right?
[209:15.77]I mean, I kind of like it.
[209:18.79]This is like an enemy you would be shooting at in, like, Doom, right?
[209:27.96]Okay, this is the E3 presentation.
[209:30.82]Here is the studio head.
[209:31.78]We got Kurt Freitner.
[209:33.76]Kurt Vix, no.
[209:37.36]They always have something, like, outrageous, like...
[209:45.73]like Warlord Kleksis or something.
[209:48.26]They always have to have like two X's in their name.
[209:58.84]Warlord Kleks.
[210:03.98]Sounds good.
[210:07.99]All right, here we go.
[210:12.11]So, our presentation begins.
[210:15.31]We need a stage.
[210:22.03]Which, where is it?
[210:24.23]Stage.
[210:28.02]And this is just static.
[210:32.26]We got to get in here.
[210:36.46]I don't know what you all are doing here.
[210:38.88]I don't know why there are these people here.
[210:41.81]But we need to backdrop.
[210:42.67]We need to change the set.
[210:45.93]Not a household.
[210:46.73]We want it to be... I don't know.
[210:49.43]We've got to change the background.
[210:52.28]Where is it here?
[210:53.24]Change backdrop.
[210:53.94]There it is.
[210:59.76]Forest.
[211:00.32]Is it just like a... Road.
[211:07.01]Road.
[211:13.80]There isn't just like a computer screen or like a green screen?
[211:22.18]I thought they had that.
[211:25.74]I thought they did.
[211:26.66]I thought they had that.
[211:36.95]Alleyway.
[211:41.81]Could be this.
[211:43.76]Although, I don't know why this is all here.
[211:45.76]Can you all go away?
[211:51.24]None of you have to be here.
[211:55.62]E3 in the alleyway.
[211:57.34]Alright, we're gonna do a stat- Okay, first of all... I need to find out how to move this camera freeform.
[212:09.59]Let me see this.
[212:10.51]Viewing your scene, pause, sliders...
[212:14.76]Choosing scenes.
[212:25.12]Searching for a scene.
[212:26.00]No, no, no.
[212:26.28]I know how to do all this.
[212:27.10]I just want to keep the camera static somewhere.
[212:41.60]All right, so where was... This is an E3... Who is it?
[212:44.48]Jax?
[212:47.84]Yeah, I know if I don't put anybody here, they're not going to show up.
[212:50.84]Mannequins mean that they're just available.
[212:54.04]Do I have the DLC installed?
[212:55.48]I should, yeah.
[212:56.42]Let me, like, just find out.
[212:58.60]Let me make sure I have that.
[213:00.90]It's installed.
[213:02.86]I'm using the EXE for that.
[213:06.29]You know what I'm saying?
[213:06.99]Like, is that... What's going on here?
[213:08.77]What...
[213:15.42]Why do I not have any stunt scenes?
[213:24.99]Wait, why would this not be installed?
[213:28.13]Yeah, I have the expansion installed.
[213:31.99]How does it make any sense?
[213:41.76]Wait, what?
[213:47.68]No, I should be opening it.
[213:48.62]I should have the right game open.
[213:52.68]I mean, I literally have the disc literally in my hand.
[213:58.93]You have to enable stuns and effects on the campaign, but this is just sandbox mode.
[214:09.89]Hold on.
[214:10.83]Back out of here.
[214:15.56]This is very confusing to me.
[214:19.97]Do I have to have, like, a stunt section?
[214:25.09]Hold on a minute.
[214:26.63]This is weird.
[214:31.51]Like, do I have to hire a stuntman?
[214:35.18]I don't remember this happening.
[214:36.28]This is kind of fucked up.
[214:47.85]Maybe it's no stunts for this scene.
[214:50.05]But I don't think they were available in the other one either.
[214:51.91]Hold on.
[214:53.67]I know there's stunts for some of these.
[214:55.49]Like the bank, for instance.
[214:59.27]Hey, wouldn't it be here?
[215:01.23]I swear to God.
[215:02.07]They have like a different... They have a different thing on the thumbnail, don't they?
[215:10.27]Yeah, there's different scene thumbnails.
[215:19.86]Like, this definitely stunts here.
[215:21.14]I'm very, very, very confused.
[215:25.10]Back to the menu?
[215:31.99]Hold on.
[215:36.23]Back up for a second.
[215:37.27]What the fuck is going on here?
[215:47.26]This is fine.
[215:47.74]We can just do it again.
[216:00.07]No, that's it's but what what's what the fuck it hold on a second.
[216:03.24]It's not even here Why is it?
[216:05.38]Why do I not have the expansion?
[216:10.02]What I'm so confused What
[216:32.79]I don't think, let me try this.
[216:41.19]Yeah, there's a movies.
[216:46.00]Something broke here when I installed it.
[216:48.20]God damn it, no.
[216:49.10]Is this gonna work?
[217:04.14]No, I have the patch.
[217:07.44]Oh, come on.
[217:08.14]Don't do this to me now.
[217:09.06]Yeah, I was wondering, because some things were just missing.
[217:14.54]But I installed them both.
[217:17.67]I'm launching it from the expansion EXE, and it's telling me it's not installed properly somehow.
[217:24.27]Fuck me.
[217:24.85]Don't tell me this is going to happen.
[217:32.63]That makes no sense.
[217:40.69]Ugh.
[217:42.27]I thought this was ready to go, too.
[217:43.87]Fuck me.
[217:50.70]I was really looking forward to it, too, but apparently I don't know why this won't work.
[218:08.16]Um...
[218:12.79]I'm so confused.
[218:13.65]Is there a way that I could see inside of why this would be happening like this?
[218:17.57]Like inside the actual data?
[218:26.89]Like inside the actual folder for the game.
[218:30.24]Is there a way I can see if the stunt stuff is installed in there?
[218:38.28]Like a certain file or something?
[218:39.46]Hold on, let me put this up.
[218:49.02]This is so fucking frustrating.
[218:53.32]It actually is.
[219:08.19]It should... It looks like it should be in there.
[219:11.91]The stun should have his own folder.
[219:13.48]Yeah, that's what I was thinking too, but why...
[219:20.20]I have no fucking idea.
[219:21.36]Let me see what happens when I do this.
[219:26.78]Uh, I might have to reinstall it then.
[219:28.98]Fuck.
[219:37.87]I wonder what happened, because I went through the process of installing it normally, and it said it was done.
[219:56.39]What a way to take the fucking wind out of my sails game.
[220:08.03]Let me take a look at this.
[220:14.03]Yeah, I have no idea.
[220:16.51]I'm going to try something real quick and see what happens.
[220:18.76]I'm going to run like the... I'm going to reinstall the Dungeon Effect.
[220:30.29]Setup has detected that you already have the movie's stunts and effects installed.
[220:36.21]Well, what the fuck are you talking about?
[220:42.24]What the fuck is happening, man?
[220:48.32]I'm just gonna run it from the disk and see what happens.
[221:03.31]Like, will it open from here?
[221:04.49]Because maybe the EXE is fucked up.
[221:15.09]This is beyond anything that I could ever imagine would be wrong.
[221:19.55]Yeah, I'm running as administrator.
[221:20.87]I don't understand.
[221:31.86]Fuck me.
[221:36.57]I need a no CD.
[221:37.31]Yeah, I have the no CD.
[221:38.73]That's what's the weird part about this.
[221:42.50]I have the no CD already.
[221:54.53]And it's the right one.
[222:05.64]Let me just see something here.
[222:17.69]For the purposes of just, I just don't want to sit here and try to.
[222:22.41]Let me try one thing.
[222:47.35]I have stunts and effects.
[222:51.83]Yeah, I have the right one.
[222:53.15]I don't know why it's doing this.
[223:10.74]Alright, well.
[223:14.06]I'm gonna have to just either go... Kind of don't know what to do.
[223:18.67]Let's pray that this works.
[223:34.62]Pray that this works.
[223:42.56]Oh, oh, oh, oh, did it work, did it work, did it work, did it work?
[223:47.20]Did it work?
[223:56.90]Did it work?
[224:00.04]Work?
[224:01.59]Yes!
[224:08.59]It worked!
[224:11.83]Alright!
[224:12.51]Why the fuck was that so- that makes no sense!
[224:19.70]I wish I had even a percent of explanation as to why this has happened.
[224:26.12]Holy shit guys, that made no sense.
[224:31.03]Take a look.
[224:31.99]We're good.
[224:32.35]Although you guys can't see now though.
[224:42.34]Why can you not?
[224:42.94]Come on, capture this shit, man.
[224:44.19]Don't do this now.
[224:44.97]Come on, hurry up.
[224:46.03]Let's go.
[224:49.81]I got it on my screen.
[224:51.49]Capture!
[224:54.79]Capture, you piece of crap!
[224:58.73]Stop putting up hurdles!
[224:59.93]I want to make a movie!
[225:15.71]What are you doing now?
[225:16.77]Oh it won't pull it won't capture it now of course not Give me a fucking break.
[225:26.95]Oh my god computers suck Let me just try capturing the window
[225:50.06]Now it won't pull it.
[225:51.44]Now it won't capture it.
[225:53.12]It's playing, but I can't... I have to capture my desktop again.
[225:59.24]Let's hope this works.
[226:03.59]Oh my fucking god.
[226:05.01]I'm so pissed off right now.
[226:09.63]You have no idea how just pure angry I am.
[226:14.71]It's gonna work.
[226:15.31]It's working.
[226:15.99]It's gonna work.
[226:19.31]But like, holy shit, I am infuriated at the moment.
[226:23.11]This is so stupid.
[226:52.88]Alright.
[226:56.08]God damn it.
[226:57.69]Here we go.
[227:02.41]No stun injuries, otherwise I don't think people will be able to... Let's go ahead and make all this shit again.
[227:12.86]Well, sorry for that.
[227:14.06]That was a lot of bullshit.
[227:16.20]I'm as frustrated as you are.
[227:17.96]Way more frustrated than you probably are.
[227:22.63]But, here we go.
[227:24.07]Let's do it again.
[227:24.57]Alright.
[227:41.71]Ayayay.
[227:46.71]And we're back!
[227:48.51]We're here.
[227:49.81]We're finally about to start.
[227:53.61]It's a hospital, it's sure.
[227:54.93]Okay.
[228:07.70]So we need... I need those sets back.
[228:15.69]There are a shitload more sets.
[228:17.89]Because, see, the green screen, there we go, alright.
[228:22.36]I was wondering what the hell it was.
[228:25.18]Very confusing.
[228:33.04]I'm just gonna get all the sets out here.
[228:41.23]At least the ones that I know I want to use.
[228:49.81]Uh, green screen.
[229:01.50]Okay.
[229:05.69]Uh, what does it want me to do?
[229:08.47]Restaurant, hospital, right?
[229:10.45]Stunt school.
[229:13.37]Yeah, I need stuntmen.
[229:23.42]Uh, Starship Bridge 4 has stunts in it somehow.
[229:34.23]Let's go.
[229:34.77]I got my sci-fi corridor.
[229:43.08]Scrolling landscape.
[229:45.98]Stage.
[229:52.60]Although I'm not sure... I think I can do this and then build what I need, right?
[229:58.62]I think I can just make the movie and then shoot it.
[230:01.12]And I just need to build the things that I use.
[230:03.38]Yeah, I don't need to do this.
[230:04.16]Alright, so get me out of here.
[230:13.94]Let us go to the script.
[230:15.68]Well, I need to bring in the people, but hold on.
[230:17.66]Here's the worst thing about this.
[230:19.10]Are the actors going to be available or do I have to make them into separate... That shouldn't happen, right?
[230:25.58]It's kind of running like shit.
[230:32.96]Why is it running like this?
[230:35.36]No, I'm gonna do a full-on RE in a second here.
[230:50.83]Betty.
[230:51.61]Adam Sandler.
[231:01.31]And you.
[231:04.09]No, I need you.
[231:04.71]Somebody needs to be a director.
[231:05.71]Which I was gonna do... Can I do any more?
[231:08.71]Oh, shit.
[231:16.00]I just made this person a director.
[231:17.38]I just made Leo the director.
[231:19.40]No, no, no, no, no.
[231:21.58]You're an actor.
[231:22.10]Don't worry.
[231:28.22]Uh, who should be the director, then?
[231:30.08]You.
[231:32.21]Alright, we're good.
[231:34.71]Let's go to the script office.
[231:38.08]Which is down... Cult Stars?
[231:41.96]What the hell is that?
[231:44.44]Hospital.
[231:44.98]This is post-production.
[231:48.10]Where is the... Where the hell is it?
[231:54.24]Right here?
[231:56.50]No.
[231:56.86]Do I not have one?
[232:04.94]Custom script.
[232:05.82]I already own it.
[232:06.38]I have no idea what the hell it is, though.
[232:09.64]It's literally right next to me.
[232:11.74]Alright, here we go.
[232:13.46]We can finally create something.
[232:15.56]After a million years.
[232:20.85]Well, we already did the first one, but... It took like 20 fucking minutes, 30 minutes to get this going again.
[232:26.15]Let's try it again.
[232:35.11]This is Action.
[232:40.77]Jax.
[232:43.20]And Leo.
[232:47.00]And... Adam Sandler.
[232:51.80]You are the studio head.
[232:53.38]What was this guy's name?
[233:01.17]Kurt, uh...
[233:04.24]Kurt Rock?
[233:11.40]Brock Hardman?
[233:12.42]No, no, no, no.
[233:12.94]It was Kurt Frightener, yeah.
[233:20.13]Pogo Stick?
[233:25.11]Alright, good.
[233:28.38]Now it's you to boo, you to costumes.
[233:43.12]You over here He's on a firefighter outfit no it's like the space marine one where is it Did I pass it already
[234:09.83]Oh, here we go.
[234:12.29]This is better.
[234:14.32]I like that better than the other one.
[234:18.44]And then this had, that was like the lizard.
[234:30.42]Oh, should it be the lizard?
[234:34.13]Yeah.
[234:35.43]I think so.
[234:39.77]Alright.
[234:42.19]Welcome to E3.
[234:44.77]Finally.
[234:45.89]Let's go.
[234:50.33]We're starting on the stage.
[235:04.36]Stunts.
[235:04.96]Thank god.
[235:07.38]I was about to throw up all of my insides.
[235:12.75]So, we need to do, um, just get static here.
[235:20.71]There we go.
[235:21.37]Alright, see, free cam.
[235:23.71]Now, that's what I was, you see what's happening?
[235:26.35]You know what I mean?
[235:26.85]I was like, what the fuck was happening?
[235:28.25]Why can I not move the camera?
[235:29.61]I didn't have the, I didn't have the fucking EXE installed somehow.
[235:33.69]But I did.
[235:34.17]I had to, like, replace it twice.
[235:39.28]Alright, so, let's start here.
[235:41.27]We're going to have him walk on stage.
[235:45.05]So I think this is just start position.
[235:51.74]And position two, right?
[235:53.00]That's fine.
[235:57.58]Well, maybe I don't even need to do that.
[235:59.99]Let's look at it from the camera.
[236:03.99]Alright, now.
[236:06.71]Backdrop.
[236:12.78]Green screen.
[236:16.36]But the green screen implies that there's... We have to be somewhere else.
[236:22.40]I mean, this is pretty close.
[236:36.65]This is pretty good too.
[236:39.91]E3 on a rooftop.
[236:47.31]It's like a news station.
[236:50.23]This is pretty good.
[236:55.67]Oh my god, 24.
[236:56.78]Yeah, we're gonna do, oh my god, 24.
[237:08.51]Sounds good to me.
[237:09.29]Okay, stage.
[237:13.77]Let's see.
[237:16.20]We need to have preparation.
[237:19.28]Walk with a briefcase.
[237:25.30]It's gotta be the right scene, though.
[237:28.22]Oh my god, 24.
[237:28.62]Okay.
[237:41.62]let's slow that down a little by the way let me just I want to just rip sorry for that last like 30 40 minutes guys uh I I I was about to just throw in the towel so like I'm back to and we're good everything's fine I'm sorry that that happened but I just want to say that I I was trying to handle that I was trying
[238:08.07]What happened?
[238:08.55]The game didn't load in the expansion and I almost lost my mind.
[238:14.97]Alright, so I... This needs to be a little bit longer.
[238:20.35]Why would the case and the hand matter?
[238:21.86]Alright, I need to do free camera here.
[238:27.06]Alright, start position we're gonna do over here.
[238:29.10]The immersion is gonna be broken so badly.
[238:36.57]You're shooting this like a fucking restaurant.
[238:43.91]Let's do start here.
[238:45.65]And then we're going to end here.
[238:49.81]While he walks.
[238:59.56]Let's see what that looks like.
[239:06.68]why would he walk by the camera like stop I extend turn to the camera he's just gonna walk by okay can I have him with it still with that in his hand walk briefcase again yeah we need a little bit more than that
[239:38.99]So he goes this way, comes over here.
[239:41.35]All right.
[239:46.20]Where is he?
[239:47.96]Change the scene to... No, not the scene.
[239:50.32]Here.
[239:54.06]Okay, so he just walks by, but we need him to walk from the other direction.
[240:01.87]He's going to take a long time to get to this fucking stage.
[240:05.85]All right, hold on.
[240:07.99]So I need to do, go to start position is... I want to move out.
[240:23.27]How do I move the camera up?
[240:25.15]Whoa, what is this field of view?
[240:33.26]How do I move the camera up?
[240:35.32]Alt?
[240:36.26]There we go, alt.
[240:43.36]This movie is a joke compared to your magnum opus Get Out of Town.
[240:46.04]You'll never top that heart-wrenching scene when Benedict was brutally murdered and shitted himself.
[240:49.92]Okay.
[240:50.22]Is that gonna be enough?
[241:19.22]Let's see.
[241:27.50]This stage is way... It's not... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[241:34.83]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the head of Oh My God Studios.
[241:40.29]Studio head... Greg.
[241:43.33]Greg.
[241:54.82]Alright, should we do one more?
[241:56.06]Or is he here?
[241:58.41]Let's have him coming into the scene now.
[242:06.95]Walk with a scanner.
[242:07.89]Brandish blade.
[242:09.30]No, no, no, no, no.
[242:10.88]Is there any more briefcase?
[242:15.36]Enter briefcase.
[242:16.14]Here we go.
[242:16.74]Enter briefcase.
[242:20.02]What does it look like?
[242:24.84]That's the same one.
[242:25.90]Is it the same one?
[242:37.47]What are the... What?
[242:39.75]Walk briefcase.
[242:40.83]Enter briefcase.
[242:46.80]What about exit briefcase?
[242:52.78]They're all the same thing.
[242:57.13]Okay, we're going to change this.
[243:02.27]Now we're just going to have, like, talking.
[243:05.43]Talk left.
[243:06.53]All right, so here we go.
[243:07.19]Talk.
[243:11.30]No, there's no other person here.
[243:15.90]Don't worry.
[243:16.20]We're not going to even use them.
[243:18.92]Duration long.
[243:21.16]Left actor is happy.
[243:23.90]And the right actor doesn't matter because the right actor is not even in the scene.
[243:39.52]His mouth isn't even moving.
[243:47.53]No, no, no.
[243:48.09]Happy is not going to work.
[243:50.43]This needs to be something else.
[243:52.39]Angry, romantic, sad.
[243:54.33]Just neutral.
[244:10.06]That's better.
[244:10.42]Then we get in a crowd, cheer.
[244:11.34]There is a person on the right that he's talking to.
[244:13.00]Hold on.
[244:13.20]Is there a better one?
[244:14.15]Is it like just one person talk?
[244:38.14]It's two people.
[244:39.14]I can just remove the other person.
[244:40.20]Here we go.
[244:40.54]Talk right.
[244:40.98]It's always going to be... Talk turn.
[244:47.67]Talk to dog.
[244:50.55]Payphone talk.
[244:55.25]Let's see.
[244:57.34]Intro.
[244:58.96]Weight lifting.
[244:59.72]He comes up and just lifts up a bunch of fucking weights.
[245:07.61]Monologue.
[245:10.54]Perfect.
[245:13.24]Let's see what we got here.
[245:16.32]Mood.
[245:19.96]Happy.
[245:20.72]Perspective.
[245:22.16]Why?
[245:22.48]We can just change this.
[245:23.71]Duration.
[245:24.93]Medium.
[245:25.19]Let's see how this goes.
[245:37.66]Okay, let's get another cut here with a close-up.
[245:42.72]Same thing.
[245:50.53]I'll change the backdrops, don't worry.
[246:00.22]Put Minecraft in the background.
[246:11.37]Okay.
[246:13.75]Maybe like right here.
[246:18.33]This one he's going to be angry, mood, argumentative, duration abrupt.
[246:27.33]Let's try this one out.
[246:28.85]Apparently he didn't like the way the audience reacted to this.
[246:46.51]I'm going to go back here.
[246:48.71]Yeah, 24.
[246:51.61]Put that back here as well.
[246:56.97]I need an audience.
[247:03.62]Is there like a play?
[247:07.26]There's got to be a bar?
[247:10.98]No, no.
[247:11.76]Like a theater?
[247:17.13]Jail, saloon, bedroom, street.
[247:23.08]I wonder if there's like a crowd or something.
[247:31.62]Or at least a place where people could be like sitting.
[247:37.82]I don't think so.
[247:43.57]Why?
[247:43.77]Somebody's just watching from their living room?
[247:50.54]Someone's watching on their computer.
[247:51.64]It's like a live stream.
[247:52.40]I think we're just gonna have to do, um... Extras.
[247:59.09]And on stage.
[248:00.31]But with a different backdrop.
[248:06.21]Yeah, let's see, like, crowd.
[248:10.32]No, like, group.
[248:13.12]Group meeting, group move.
[248:18.82]Cheer.
[248:21.29]hmm conversation investigation I think we can just do we could probably do static sit and talk yeah I mean that you could do sit and talk sit and smoking yeah static with a bunch of extras I think is the best the audience is sitting on the ground uh let's do static
[248:54.81]And change the backdrop to... something that looks like they're in a theater?
[249:15.44]Burning City.
[249:18.26]Canvas background?
[249:19.83]No.
[249:30.39]Falling?
[249:31.37]Wait, everyone's falling.
[249:40.21]This looks alright.
[249:41.01]Alright, we need extras.
[249:49.46]Supporting role, first extra, extra, okay.
[250:04.18]This is gonna need a lot of extras.
[250:07.74]Okay, how do I take like the gun away from this person?
[250:19.51]How do I get this off?
[250:31.20]There's no way I can get rid of this!
[250:35.83]How do I delete this?
[250:45.78]What is going on over here?
[250:46.88]Yeah, I'm just going to delete this extra.
[250:53.70]Okay.
[250:58.12]And this one too.
[250:59.22]And this one.
[251:00.00]And you as well.
[251:02.12]You're not going to be in this movie.
[251:08.12]And they're making zombie noises.
[251:13.26]Wait.
[251:14.44]Change props.
[251:15.60]Oh, shit.
[251:16.24]Okay.
[251:16.52]Alright, let's see.
[251:29.36]Change props.
[251:33.33]Slot 1.
[251:33.99]Yeah, I cleared the props.
[251:40.45]So how do I, can I put something else in here?
[251:51.14]All these props are just guns.
[251:57.40]Different cell phones.
[251:58.46]What the hell is this, a seashell?
[251:59.80]Okay, no, you don't get, nobody gets a gun.
[252:10.05]Okay, this is a banana.
[252:11.85]You can have a banana in your hand, that's fine.
[252:17.15]Okay, that's fine.
[252:24.20]Good.
[252:30.30]So now we can edit this and put this in a different spot.
[252:32.94]So he talks here.
[252:37.02]Let's make sure we got that correct.
[252:40.49]We actually need to move the camera a little bit.
[252:42.39]Let's do free cam.
[252:53.56]Make it at least look like they're sitting down.
[252:57.54]Except how would they be?
[252:58.38]At least some of them are sitting down.
[253:04.08]Is somebody just staring off into the distance?
[253:06.09]Alright, that's fine.
[253:09.37]So we go from here.
[253:15.27]Talked about a few things here.
[253:16.43]We're going to have at least three or four different adjectives here.
[253:24.34]And that leads to showing the audience.
[253:31.26]And then we come back to his reaction.
[253:36.62]He's gonna announce a mobile game.
[253:38.49]And they're all gonna fucking boo.
[253:41.31]And then he's gonna say, well, let's show it.
[253:53.16]Uh, how about, let's go back to monologue.
[254:01.49]Somebody, like, from the audience comes up.
[254:04.63]He gets, like, a strangling match with them.
[254:16.32]Okay, so... Angry.
[254:23.50]And it's gonna be short.
[254:26.15]Let's see.
[254:34.24]This is gonna probably come up straight in my face.
[254:36.38]This is gonna make me a billion dollars.
[254:41.55]All right, motherfucker.
[254:42.41]And he like sprints up.
[254:58.97]This is an extra.
[255:07.56]Running.
[255:10.00]Angry.
[255:11.64]Direction, this way, yeah.
[255:20.39]Can we slow that down?
[255:31.95]Determined.
[255:39.26]Determined is so fast.
[255:51.01]Yeah, I think that's the one.
[256:09.31]Let's do, where is it?
[256:16.28]News logo five.
[256:27.61]All right, and then he's gonna get like one, he's gonna get knocked out.
[256:40.22]The only thing is, this could be a different person.
[256:47.93]It's just gonna be a random extra that's up here.
[256:59.34]Action, tame, mild, moderate, extreme.
[257:11.75]Shit.
[257:19.33]That is extreme, alright.
[257:39.04]I think I just like the first perspective.
[257:46.85]Okay.
[257:48.39]We've got to be on the right backdrop.
[257:50.38]I actually have to film this.
[257:56.94]We've got to get the start position over here.
[257:59.94]So it looks like he may have ran over here.
[258:07.53]I don't want him in the scene yet.
[258:12.21]And then we move forward.
[258:20.92]And let's see how that looks.
[258:24.70]Like he just queued it up.
[258:34.99]Wait a minute.
[258:47.60]Okay, hold on.
[258:48.48]Start position here.
[258:50.91]Mark position.
[258:52.45]Go to mark position.
[258:56.51]And then the second position is here.
[259:03.55]And then we mark this one too.
[259:06.73]Mark position.
[259:11.54]That's right, right?
[259:13.44]Should be.
[259:20.70]Why is it not doing it?
[259:25.51]Shouldn't that position be marked here?
[259:30.47]Because if this is position 1, here's your start position.
[259:37.00]It's marked here.
[259:44.73]And I want it to move... Yeah, it's a keyframe, so shouldn't it... Wouldn't this be... You know, like... I can't mark it here.
[260:04.29]Not quite keyframing.
[260:06.53]Start and end equals beginning and end of the clip.
[260:09.34]Oh, okay.
[260:14.44]So this is the beginning of the clip.
[260:20.30]Position 2 is at the end right now.
[260:22.40]So I would want it to be start position.
[260:27.41]But wouldn't I want it to be start position and then... What, like I have to move it forward a little?
[260:40.13]Because I think of this like it's not keyframes, but...
[260:46.85]Move the camera on the second timeline.
[260:51.45]Oh, I see here.
[260:55.35]So I can do this.
[260:58.13]If I mark it.
[261:01.20]How come I can't get... I'm not putting this together here in my head.
[261:21.03]Oh, Jesus Christ, what the hell is this doing over here?
[261:23.13]Alright.
[261:31.81]So, here we go.
[261:41.32]See if that fixes it.
[261:46.14]So then... Right... I want it to be like here.
[261:57.04]Let's see if that does it.
[262:04.26]Fuck.
[262:07.09]God damn it.
[262:08.69]What is happening here?
[262:09.65]I... Camera 2.
[262:21.80]What the hell?
[262:22.80]Why did I drag it over?
[262:23.84]What?
[262:24.54]Because...
[262:26.51]Marked position.
[262:27.37]This is camera one.
[262:30.15]Camera one is here.
[262:31.05]Camera two is... I want camera two to be here.
[262:37.93]What the fuck am I doing here?
[262:40.19]Ah!
[262:41.69]Position one.
[262:43.11]Position two.
[262:44.41]Position one.
[262:45.37]Position two.
[262:50.09]So I want it to be like... It's just like weird.
[262:54.07]Position one.
[262:55.19]Position two.
[263:06.78]Okay, so this is correct now, right?
[263:10.40]This shit's correct.
[263:22.29]Alright, there we go.
[263:23.09]That's kind of a weird system.
[263:26.99]Alright, here we go.
[263:48.99]I think, yeah, okay, so that's gonna be an edit.
[263:53.13]So I'll edit that out.
[263:55.49]I'm gonna have him fall down and then the trailer's gonna play.
[264:00.11]He like just fucking knocked himself out.
[264:12.84]Would that be under?
[264:13.60]Let's see.
[264:14.02]Uh, violence...
[264:22.99]Dead body.
[264:25.65]He drinks poison and then the clip plays?
[264:30.79]Just make him fight the kraut.
[264:36.06]Kraut shoot?
[264:38.32]Oh, I thought at first I thought it was kraut shoot.
[264:50.42]What about unconscious?
[264:57.01]Let's see.
[264:57.67]Pursuit.
[264:58.43]Resolution.
[265:02.85]Impact.
[265:05.82]Head.
[265:06.08]Oh, right.
[265:06.78]This one.
[265:14.54]He fucking headbutts the guy and then instantly gets knocked out and the trailer plays.
[265:37.49]No, this is better.
[265:38.11]He's just already out.
[265:39.15]Okay, let's change the camera here.
[265:59.50]Okay.
[266:02.46]So let's do... Let's go to camera 1.
[266:10.44]This camera too.
[266:17.24]Now I gotta mark it.
[266:37.47]Okay, let's see how that looks.
[266:55.27]I need the E3 backdrop here.
[267:06.14]Where's the far... This is not post-production yet.
[267:11.46]Yeah, we can edit that part, because when he starts shaking his head... Oh, he's at it.
[267:16.20]Fall forward.
[267:17.57]Like, right there.
[267:18.11]Fall forward.
[267:22.51]Okay, now let's go to the...
[267:26.21]Let's just go to stage again.
[267:28.29]We're gonna zoom in to the screen.
[267:37.30]These people aren't even gonna be here.
[267:40.97]The backdrop is going to be just normal.
[267:48.17]I guess I could change to something.
[267:59.51]It just zooms into this stupid spaceship.
[268:07.43]Yeah, I could do a fade too.
[268:09.27]Yeah, I don't need this.
[268:14.17]Alright, so we've got what we want.
[268:17.07]These are all ready.
[268:17.81]We're gonna fade into this Sci-Fi Corridor 5.
[268:32.71]Here we go.
[268:34.37]This is constant conflict.
[268:41.48]So, first of all, there needs to be, like, I don't know, something to grab you immediately.
[268:47.07]Somebody's got CPR performed on him.
[268:50.77]He's like, meh.
[269:08.39]All right, so who's it?
[269:10.61]He's in the game.
[269:12.39]It's his game.
[269:13.37]He's in it.
[269:14.23]He's like the motion capture.
[269:20.43]Okay, this is how we need.
[269:21.62]No, he can't be in his own fucking game.
[269:36.93]Alright, well, who is the alien?
[269:38.19]Does this make sense?
[269:48.95]He's giving CPR to the alien.
[269:57.58]Come on, don't you die on me!
[269:59.20]This is taking so long.
[270:11.89]That's so long.
[270:16.63]Why is he sitting here like this?
[270:21.64]This is way too long.
[270:30.34]Okay, we need, uh... Lighting.
[270:36.59]Weather.
[270:37.93]Weather.
[270:39.53]Yeah, fog, because everything's all fucked up.
[270:41.39]Like, this ship is going down.
[270:42.49]Okay, now we need... Let's get some extras in here.
[270:55.08]Or maybe a supporting character?
[270:56.78]No, we need... Can I do, like, aliens and shit?
[271:11.12]What about the extras?
[271:12.16]Can I like... How do I make everybody like a fucking alien?
[271:23.61]Find first supporting role.
[271:25.25]Because I have my actors, but then I have... Can I put some random person here?
[271:38.77]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[271:44.86]I can change the costumes, but I can't change the extras costumes.
[271:58.34]Hmm.
[272:01.02]You can?
[272:04.64]How come I got this grayed out?
[272:07.04]How do I do that?
[272:11.09]Drag an extra there, drag them to the hanger.
[272:15.42]All right, so there's an extra here, and then... Oh, fuck.
[272:19.58]Okay, that just kind of popped out.
[272:21.83]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[272:22.95]What's going on here?
[272:28.15]Why is the extra him?
[272:39.06]This is strange.
[272:50.68]You have to put a person as an extra.
[272:53.04]Oh.
[272:56.88]So we just need like a bunch of people.
[273:01.15]I don't have... I guess... Can I make... Can I make Jex an extra?
[273:21.23]Okay, so, I guess, I guess you're just gonna be a robot.
[273:29.60]But what are you defending?
[273:30.72]Alright, we also need to have, like, something going on while this is happening that has to be, like, a fucking explosion.
[273:43.87]Stunts.
[273:46.09]Fire group.
[273:46.87]A group of people run down a burning corridor.
[273:48.57]Explosion run.
[273:52.25]Fight zombies.
[273:54.37]Fire group.
[273:54.89]Fire choke.
[273:56.77]Fire staring.
[273:57.73]Fire trap.
[273:58.73]Throttle victim.
[274:06.67]Fire hero.
[274:16.90]No, this is just... That's all there is here.
[274:21.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[274:22.47]Redo this one.
[274:30.30]Fight ain't over yet.
[274:31.24]Ambush from above.
[274:32.08]What is he holding?
[274:53.23]What is that?
[274:55.20]What the hell is in his hand?
[274:56.32]Is that a can opener?
[275:07.16]Ambush from above.
[275:20.27]What?
[275:23.41]Oh, OK.
[275:23.97]I'm just, what the hell happened?
[275:41.21]OK, hold on.
[275:44.84]When does he land?
[275:57.15]Alright, so there's surprise, then there's also... Then there's ambush.
[276:02.36]He spends a shitload of time knocking on his... I don't even know what the hell he's holding, whatever it is.
[276:11.63]Okay, hold on.
[276:28.27]Spider-Man kiss.
[276:29.41]Okay, I don't hate this one.
[276:33.77]But I'm going to trim a huge amount of it off.
[276:41.00]Okay, we need... I might play from here.
[277:10.04]Change this prop to something else.
[277:12.16]To a banana?
[277:20.43]Is there a way I can actually put a prop in here without having to take from whatever they have?
[277:28.60]Because this is the slot one.
[277:29.88]Is there a way I can get a better list?
[277:42.39]Apparently not.
[277:43.79]Unless I can do something from another menu or something.
[277:51.15]Static prop should be there, I guess.
[277:53.24]I don't know why.
[277:56.24]Strange.
[278:01.44]Alright, I think this is good.
[278:02.72]I'm going to use this... We need to have just like a general soldier here, though.
[278:14.74]What is this haircut?
[278:21.99]Why is he dressed like this?
[278:30.65]Alright, it looks fine.
[278:32.19]We just need this, just a quick little like, got you moment where it's just like, bang!
[278:36.32]Like right, like here.
[278:50.55]OK, let's go right there.
[278:51.75]Maybe like there.
[279:29.88]Okay, so then like this.
[279:36.54]Move the camera here.
[279:42.91]That's like too much.
[279:44.83]How is he, hold on.
[280:00.40]All right, so then it should be there and then there.
[280:06.22]Right at this right moment, like this.
[280:12.01]Camera one, camera two.
[280:13.79]I think that should be correct, right?
[280:23.11]Yep.
[280:24.31]So we'll edit it.
[280:24.91]We'll have this.
[280:31.37]Grab his head!
[280:38.38]That second camera sucks, but it's fine.
[280:49.22]Because they're gonna be- Bang!
[280:50.21]Cut.
[280:56.33]Let's have, now, like a battlefield.
[281:04.88]Tropical jungle?
[281:08.83]No, we gotta have like a war scene now.
[281:13.05]On a bridge.
[281:14.21]Starship bridge.
[281:22.95]Kill zombie.
[281:25.43]No, that has to be like... Preparation here.
[281:28.27]Fire staring.
[281:29.15]Someone stares through the fire.
[281:35.20]No, we need... Let's take off stunts.
[281:39.29]Just do violence.
[281:44.97]Drink react?
[281:45.99]Drink poison?
[281:50.07]Explosion reaction.
[281:53.96]Firing blanks.
[282:01.06]Shooting dance?
[282:05.91]Wait, what do you mean shooting dance?
[282:07.57]How do you act professional here?
[282:34.03]Okay.
[282:41.32]He's doing the Carlton.
[282:43.30]What is that?
[282:43.70]Professional.
[283:39.36]Alright, this has to be somebody... Now, you're gonna be in a different costume than this.
[284:08.50]This is gonna be like an extra.
[284:09.94]This is what they do to humans.
[284:10.99]They fucking torture them.
[284:18.79]What is this guy doing over here?
[284:32.79]They torture by bullying people.
[284:39.46]Okay, that's fine.
[284:42.16]And then we need... Yeah, I'm gonna... Don't worry, I'll have a subtitle that says that.
[284:56.73]Not actual gameplay.
[285:18.50]I'm gonna have him run through, like, eight different corridors like this.
[285:22.64]Starship bridge one.
[285:25.33]Same thing.
[285:34.62]I just want explosion- explosion run.
[285:54.67]Okay, that's fine.
[285:56.63]What is this called?
[285:58.57]This is called Explosive Run.
[286:10.99]Come on.
[286:11.49]Give me some more Explosive Runs.
[286:17.83]Shit.
[286:19.07]I wanted to run through, like, five different corridors.
[286:22.42]I guess I could just have them do...
[286:24.61]the same one over and over again.
[286:26.19]Alright, what is it?
[286:37.87]Starship 4?
[286:39.74]Quarter 5, maybe?
[286:44.44]Bullet, run, explode, here we go.
[286:45.92]There we go, perfect.
[286:58.75]Okay, sci-fi corridor.
[287:04.22]Corridor one.
[287:06.76]He just goes... He's running around the whole entire fucking...
[287:29.71]Is it the same one?
[287:30.53]No.
[287:35.67]Yeah, make him run through somewhere else.
[287:38.31]Yeah, make him run through like a living room.
[287:41.36]Is there like a sprint through a living room?
[287:52.39]It's too short.
[287:54.13]Hold on.
[287:55.33]Location two.
[288:09.25]smiling.
[288:39.24]Alright, now we... Back to the explosions.
[288:54.98]Corridor 4.
[289:04.35]Corridor 4.
[289:05.39]No, no, no.
[289:06.07]Back to corridor...
[289:09.90]Should he just run by the stage with his own body on it?
[289:16.37]Alright, moving, what about car?
[289:22.57]He like runs, yeah, he's like just in the world.
[289:24.53]Alright, let's go see if I can do that.
[289:34.12]Let's go to stage.
[289:54.55]Why?
[289:54.77]This doesn't make any sense.
[290:01.26]Constant fucking conflict.
[290:08.90]Yeah, we're gonna have like an alien, like he, this is, the trailer is behind him here.
[290:17.17]You know what I mean?
[290:17.85]Like this is, the trailer's behind him.
[290:23.79]There's the spaceship!
[290:24.57]Alright, now we're gonna have... Okay, almost time for the trailer to be over.
[290:50.00]Why would it zoom in on this?
[290:56.55]Action, moderate, action, heavy.
[291:00.29]Oh my, he's kicking the shit out of him.
[291:07.82]What's after that?
[291:08.76]There's extreme.
[291:13.82]That reaction shot.
[291:23.03]I don't understand that one.
[291:27.99]He breaks his neck back again.
[291:32.77]I think I like Heavy, because Heavy does just more punches.
[291:39.27]Okay, this also needs to be... You're going to be in a different costume here.
[291:47.10]You're going to be one of the aliens.
[291:50.04]Am I fucking this whole thing up?
[291:52.48]I might be.
[292:01.16]It's Mysterio.
[292:18.16]Far from home.
[292:26.91]favorite part.
[292:28.12]When he just, like, drops him.
[292:31.08]You do realize, when he lands on this ground, I'm gonna make a loud, awful thud.
[292:35.69]Like, crashes and glass breaking because of the head.
[292:40.43]Just like...
[293:06.43]Alright, the first trailer is almost over.
[293:23.24]What is this?
[293:28.20]Picnic.
[293:30.06]Let's see what they got for stunts.
[293:32.84]Horse riders shot?
[293:35.67]What do you mean, horse ride or shot?
[293:44.86]Why would there be a horse here?
[293:52.97]What's location two?
[293:59.67]I like location one better.
[294:09.37]Okay, we got... That prop has to... No, no, no.
[294:12.17]Lighting.
[294:14.94]This is fine.
[294:15.72]Weather.
[294:19.36]Wind.
[294:20.66]Strong wind.
[294:27.53]A bunch of trash.
[294:36.33]That's so much trash.
[294:46.51]Well, this has to be he's got to be
[295:15.63]Oh my god.
[295:16.35]This is so dirty.
[295:40.20]Wait, why does he fall twice?
[295:47.24]Ugh.
[295:47.38]Okay.
[295:53.14]Looking good.
[296:00.97]Let me just make sure that this shit's still looking okay.
[296:12.47]There it is.
[296:18.70]What happened to the camera here?
[296:21.28]Didn't I make... didn't I change this?
[296:30.15]I thought I had this changed.
[296:33.91]Huh.
[296:36.49]That's weird.
[296:38.41]It should be there, right?
[296:42.43]Alright, that's it for the trailer.
[296:43.81]Now we're gonna... let's go back to the stage.
[296:52.27]And we're introducing our new game.
[296:59.07]There's two games to show at this E3.
[297:00.41]Is it like Medic or... Hold on, I need... We need Loving or Showing a Card.
[297:23.18]Resolution.
[297:26.24]Take off pursuit and loving.
[297:27.98]Resolution.
[297:34.23]Okay, here we go.
[297:52.01]And then we're going to go to the next trip.
[298:04.08]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[298:05.02]I'm going to like record a dialogue of maybe in like this.
[298:15.27]This conference sucks.
[298:17.87]Fuck your company.
[298:24.14]Alright, so, new game.
[298:26.54]We'll fade into this one.
[298:29.85]It's gonna be... Who am I gonna put in this?
[298:39.05]Should it just be another conflict game?
[298:40.97]It's the same one.
[298:52.19]Make a western.
[298:53.39]Saloon bedroom.
[298:56.93]Make a dating sim.
[299:01.81]Scrolling landscape.
[299:03.77]Just like a driving game.
[299:05.55]Yeah, a driving game.
[299:13.21]And don't worry, there'll be constant conflict in this game.
[299:17.40]Streets.
[299:22.40]okay um vehicle car um he's not gonna star in his own game again
[299:52.36]Mood?
[299:53.64]What?
[300:01.14]Why would you wait that long to detonate a car bomb?
[300:08.48]Wouldn't it explode way before?
[300:19.75]That's the conflict.
[300:21.89]why wouldn't it ex why all right wait hold on wait wait we're going
[300:50.78]There's just no clothes on.
[300:52.00]He's just like, naked.
[300:59.79]Uh, what do we want?
[301:04.11]No, this is a driving game.
[301:05.80]There can't be this much constant conflict.
[301:20.07]How do you sneak?
[301:34.90]What was with the ice cream?
[301:39.47]What was the ice cream?
[301:42.53]What was the ice cream?
[301:47.99]City Street!
[301:48.89]Alright, this is the drive- I need to do a driving game.
[301:52.83]I can't just let it go off the rails.
[302:06.18]Car burnout.
[302:16.01]Alright, that's a pretty good start.
[302:29.21]Not a taxi, though.
[302:30.69]If it's a driving game, it needs to be something cool.
[302:36.05]Alright, this is pretty nice.
[302:43.07]He's gotta be in different... not different clothes.
[302:52.67]What was he in?
[302:53.31]Yeah, no, this is fine.
[302:54.13]Right here.
[303:17.82]All right, that looks good.
[303:18.60]That's a good start.
[303:21.08]That's gonna go, okay, same thing, Urban City Street.
[303:27.50]It's more like peeling out and cool shit.
[303:29.44]Car squeeze, what's that, car squeeze?
[303:31.84]Lots of people comically squeeze into a car.
[303:36.93]Just get it out of the way immediately.
[303:44.51]Should I just get it out of the way?
[303:46.01]Should I get it out of the way?
[303:50.44]Should we fill the car with clowns and then just have them get in the car?
[303:55.20]No, it can't be like this already.
[303:57.06]They have different hair!
[304:34.45]Don't worry.
[304:34.99]I'll get it.
[304:35.91]We'll get the call back.
[304:37.25]Don't worry.
[304:37.73]Here's the call back.
[304:50.16]It's never not funny.
[304:54.64]It's not.
[304:55.96]It's never not funny.
[304:56.98]It's never not funny.
[304:59.43]Constant fucking conflict.
[305:03.69]I need to be able to edit this together, though.
[305:07.65]Hold on.
[305:10.15]Some driving... Where's the clown, like, comical clown one?
[305:16.90]Car squeeze.
[305:22.33]Car squeeze.
[305:43.40]It's a normal- okay.
[305:46.88]Oh, Jesus.
[306:23.36]Okay, close the door.
[306:27.30]But I think I need to put... Hold on.
[306:32.09]It's the same people that were in the last game.
[306:33.99]I need a fucking clown costume.
[306:45.14]Is it a monster?
[306:56.60]Premium?
[307:09.93]Where is it?
[307:27.33]There are so many costumes.
[307:29.05]Can I just type in clown?
[307:37.48]Where's the clown?
[307:38.34]Where's the clown?
[307:39.12]Where's the clown?
[307:39.86]Where's the clown?
[307:40.60]Okay, I found it.
[307:58.45]okay there we go so here comes the one clown everyone's gonna be in the same clown costume
[308:27.76]I gotta get like a good... Where is it?
[308:29.96]What would it actually be under?
[308:33.40]Not casual, right?
[308:43.29]Formal work.
[308:48.13]Only like a few people need to be in clown costumes.
[309:06.31]All of them.
[309:07.83]I... What does this have to do with the game?
[309:36.25]I don't think I can even make these other extras, because I don't have them set as anybody.
[310:03.33]okay one two three four wait is it gonna be this no it's not gonna work I don't have enough extras
[310:38.40]Is there no clown costume?
[310:41.23]What?
[310:55.36]Hold on, why?
[310:56.04]I can't have a woman in a clown costume?
[311:03.74]That seems to make no sense.
[311:13.23]I don't know.
[311:19.39]There has to be a clown.
[311:20.33]I guess.
[311:20.96]I don't...
[311:45.77]Wait.
[311:49.13]Hold on.
[311:50.89]One.
[311:55.63]Two.
[311:58.73]Three.
[312:01.43]Four.
[312:03.57]Five.
[312:18.10]What if some of them are just regular people?
[312:26.37]I can fix this later.
[312:28.97]Alright, first of all, this needs to be changed.
[312:54.96]It's a guy with a different hair.
[312:58.26]I'm gonna sneeze.
[313:04.10]Okay.
[313:06.15]I also, okay.
[313:07.79]Urban office.

[313:14.03]Here we go.
[313:15.29]Perfect.
[313:18.55]Oh, look at this.
[313:21.15]This is exactly what I wanted.
[313:44.66]Where's the car I was already using?
[313:49.98]E-M-T.
[313:51.10]Alright, that looks good.
[313:51.94]Okay.
[313:56.08]Same thing, let's do... Miniature City again.
[314:03.32]Car Skid.
[314:05.48]Cars Race.
[314:08.68]Car Traffic.
[314:12.10]City Explosion?
[314:18.66]Establish the city we do like a pull it back tracking show off to the city.
[314:23.14]That sounds pretty good Let's go forwards perspective to there we go.
[314:36.97]Nice.
[314:37.21]Oh
[314:46.18]the speed up and then let's do inside the car what stunts have we got car chase car chase rear gear change dashboard
[315:14.56]Radio, L, radio, answer.
[315:18.84]Car, sudden stop.
[315:20.97]Let's see what this looks like.
[315:30.24]Turning, braking.
[315:38.08]We've done that before.
[315:48.15]Alright, who the fuck was even in the car?
[315:56.64]Which one was it?
[315:57.32]It was this one.
[315:58.38]No, it wasn't.
[316:00.92]It was like a nice car, like this one.
[316:02.52]This one right here.
[316:05.12]And I have no idea who was in the car.
[316:06.44]Oh yeah, there was like a bunch of clowns.
[316:09.02]Alright, before this derails completely... I think it was...
[316:19.70]You.
[316:20.20]No, it was you.
[316:39.87]Like it hasn't already.
[316:40.87]Well, not completely.
[316:41.93]Okay.
[316:46.40]So there's a big break.
[316:53.24]This is gonna take a fucking ton of editing, but it's gonna be worth it.
[317:02.18]City block corridor?
[317:09.49]Miniature city again.
[317:10.35]Car.
[317:19.85]Car.
[317:21.15]Traffic.
[317:32.87]There's no other... This is the only one.
[317:35.02]I wonder whose car this is supposed to be.
[318:04.89]Let's go in to the camera.
[318:08.53]Oh, easy.
[318:26.76]I want a good view of this.
[318:38.23]Too much movement.
[318:42.79]All right, let's start here, and then I'm going to go in.
[319:01.30]Why are they not moving?
[319:08.20]Oh god, they're like little set pieces, that's why.
[319:10.50]Where is it?
[319:25.03]All the way down there?
[319:31.47]Cars are like little bugs.
[319:32.59]I actually just like the static right here.
[319:41.10]This is parked.
[319:42.12]Alright, and then finally, we're gonna have... Let's go back to the street.
[319:59.27]Car parking.
[320:02.45]Exit car collapse.
[320:18.18]Alright.
[320:19.86]Let's have it.
[320:28.48]I guess we'll keep the clown theme here.
[320:40.20]Needs to be the right car.
[320:42.84]Which, I mean, this is as close as I can get it, I think.
[320:46.56]I can get it.
[320:56.33]Okay.
[320:59.03]And then... Last.
[321:01.15]This is gonna be long.
[321:04.27]It'll be worth it.
[321:05.15]It'll be worth it.
[321:16.52]Last thing.
[321:23.14]Car jump?
[321:24.85]Car crashes around a corner and slides onto its roof?
[321:32.99]Under attack.
[321:43.14]He's going to drive through.
[321:44.76]He's going to be driving through.
[321:47.36]When it explodes.
[321:54.70]Can I make this look like a spaceship car?
[322:01.83]This is going in the other scene.
[322:12.19]This is in the other game.
[322:13.45]This is going back.
[322:22.17]Alright, and finally...
[322:30.79]We're not going to use all these clips.
[322:32.03]I just want to make sure I have them.
[322:41.16]Are you just like driving?
[322:42.28]Here we go.
[322:59.87]It's a very slow drive, but it'll work.
[323:02.27]It's just aliens.
[323:20.55]This is the intro.
[323:22.71]This is where it says, not gameplay footage.
[323:42.61]Okay.
[323:47.04]I don't know what that's about.
[323:49.22]Okay.
[323:51.42]We've got enough there.
[323:55.32]It's time to bring it back to the stage and wrap up the E3 presentation.
[324:26.84]Okay, and then... Let's go back here.
[324:32.35]That's fine.
[324:35.42]Now we need somebody else to come out and just say goodbye.
[325:10.95]Let's put the camera back over this way.
[325:12.57]That's fine right there.
[325:22.47]All right.
[325:29.76]And then... We need stage again.
[325:55.80]Hair... How do I... Okay, I gotta make it... I'm just gonna make this the person, I guess.
[326:15.98]Like...
[326:31.11]Does he come out and change on stage?
[326:41.87]What the hell is it called again?
[326:43.07]There it is.
[326:50.80]Alright, done.
[327:01.29]I'm not even going to dub over this.
[327:29.37]And let's like, hold on, I want to do, I want one more thing.
[327:35.99]Let me just see.
[327:36.67]I want somebody who's on the computer, like at the desk or a computer.
[327:54.68]There.
[328:13.47]computer hacking the gorilla hacking the gorilla watching E3
[328:28.31]Yeah, and writing a bunch of mean shit on, like, Reddit.
[328:31.75]He's, like, really pissed off about what he just saw.
[328:40.95]I can't fucking believe what they showed here.
[328:43.37]You know, I really was, like, I was hoping for Yoshi's Woolly World 2.
[328:48.36]Yeah, he's on Reddit.
[329:05.09]All right, so we need to have, should this be a lizard?
[329:17.30]Search bar, Reddit.
[329:18.92]Yeah, we'll put it in.
[329:52.05]They didn't announce his favorite game.
[329:57.97]There you go.
[329:58.47]This E3 sucked.
[330:09.41]Alright, now it's my job to put this all together.
[330:20.56]Yeah, I'll make sure there's a lot of extras.
[330:24.06]So, this should be good.
[330:25.94]I don't think there's anything else.
[330:28.16]I'm pretty sure I have every scene I need.
[330:33.93]I think.
[330:43.17]I believe it's time to go back.
[330:46.95]Confirm.
[330:50.45]Save it?
[330:50.81]I will.
[330:51.47]I will.
[330:51.75]Don't worry.
[330:52.37]Don't worry.
[330:54.93]Save.
[330:56.11]I have to confirm an exit before I can save.
[331:00.26]Did I miss a backdrop somewhere?
[331:02.54]Maybe I did, but whatever.
[331:07.04]Here we go.
[331:14.65]It is ready for casting.
[331:19.69]I'm going to save the game.
[331:24.45]Let's just call this one... Peapants 2.
[331:30.20]Alright.
[331:32.56]So let's get this in the... Let's get some extras.
[331:40.48]I need to go to where the hiring is.
[331:44.94]Create... I need crew, right?
[331:49.43]Uh, I need extras.
[331:57.11]Does that matter?
[331:59.37]Or will it fill it automatically?
[332:03.84]I guess we'll find out.
[332:07.22]Because I can't drag them over here.
[332:08.44]I need to cast to start getting extras.
[332:11.90]Okay.
[332:13.34]Alright, let's do it.
[332:17.24]Begin casting.
[332:21.35]Extras.
[332:21.73]I need 11 extras.
[332:29.16]Can I even have this many people?
[332:37.06]How do I get extras?
[332:47.78]I need more crew.
[332:54.33]Now I need extras, but I can't pull these guys into extras.
[332:58.27]Just birth them.
[333:09.29]I need... I need a director.
[333:11.54]Well, I have one here.
[333:12.30]And now I need the extras.
[333:20.42]Don't they usually hang out in front of here?
[333:33.34]Huh.
[333:35.84]Because there's somebody here, but I can't add them to extras.
[333:40.76]Why?
[333:41.28]Do I have to go to the stage school to create extras?
[333:46.62]Where the hell is that one?
[333:47.70]I have to hang out in front of one of the buildings.
[333:53.84]Stunt school?
[333:55.48]I think I'm going to need some stuntmen.
[333:56.82]I need stunt doubles.
[334:06.18]Your attention, please.
[334:07.66]The rehearsal phase of our latest movie is complete.

[335:25.80]I need one more extra.
[335:27.26]I need Sci-Fi Corridor.
[335:29.98]Actor does not... does own stunts.
[335:32.20]Actor does own stunts.
[335:34.04]Oh, okay, that's fine.
[335:38.68]Alright, I need Sci-Fi Corridor 1 and 2.
[335:45.05]Let me save this.
[335:51.81]I still need one more person.

[335:55.92]I'm just going to make one of the janitors an extra.
[335:58.46]Well, there's a lot of people here.
[335:59.68]Alright, that's it.
[336:03.40]Now we need the sets.

[336:23.71]I think it's ready to go.
[336:26.17]Suburban living room one and alien world.
[336:28.61]What happens in alien world?
[336:38.47]Living room one.
[336:41.94]There it is.
[336:46.12]Spartan Torture?
[336:49.72]What is that for?
[336:56.35]What else?
[336:59.21]Suburban Street.
[337:00.59]Oh, man.
[337:01.29]Am I gonna have enough room for this shit?
[337:03.45]I might not.
[337:11.30]These are huge.
[337:11.96]I'm gonna have to move some stuff around.
[337:15.98]Oh, I got it.
[337:18.74]And then... Is that it?
[337:22.12]Here we go!
[337:26.90]It's time... to shoot it!
[337:33.28]What's wrong?
[337:34.36]You don't feel good?
[337:36.04]Jax, you don't feel good, Jax?
[337:40.79]Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean, wait?

[338:05.04]That's what you're waiting, you want me to wait for, I see.
[338:09.47]I'm gonna save it.
[338:10.29]Let's shoot it.
[338:10.67]Here we go.
[338:36.10]And... it's one star.
[338:41.71]Is it done?
[338:42.85]I got instant filming here, man.
[338:45.20]I actually think it's loading it all together.
[338:48.46]Okay.
[338:48.70]Post-production.
[338:49.26]PR and all.
[339:12.05]Post-production!
[339:22.83]I need to make sure I can do this or I'm going to have to restart the game.
[339:25.06]So let me just see what happens when I do this.
[339:31.14]I need to be able to record dialogue.
[339:37.60]Can I not?
[339:39.65]Wasn't there something weird I had to do last time for this?
[339:48.02]Hello.
[339:49.48]Testing.
[339:56.28]Hello.
[339:57.74]Testing.
[339:59.16]It works.
[340:01.04]It's really low, though.
[340:12.01]How do I get rid of this?
[340:15.15]Oh, there we go.
[340:19.03]So, we are going to change the title here.
[340:21.27]This is the big movie, so... Why does it look like crap?
[340:27.64]Why does it look like this?
[340:51.58]Yeah, this looks like wicked crusty!
[340:58.69]Alright, first of all, it's not gonna be acid-base.
[341:04.75]The following motion picture, E3 presentation.
[341:12.34]E presents liquidated production, E3 presentation.
[341:18.90]Okay, we need, um, like, applause.
[341:23.32]Let's get the music track on here.
[341:24.82]We need... Orchestral, this might be good.
[341:55.13]All right, well I'm gonna turn off like the mumbling Uh, I don't like it alleyway groove
[342:22.99]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[342:23.61]Trim before adding the sound.
[342:24.65]Okay, so this is fine.
[342:30.12]I'll do the dialogue on this one.
[342:31.34]Because I have to figure out how long I want to talk here.
[342:48.79]Hello and welcome to Oh My God 24's 24th E3.
[342:56.49]As you know that our Oh My God starts with all of our initials.
[343:02.56]Oswald, Manny, and Greg started this company back, you know, in 19... Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[343:17.71]it's the same fucking lady kissing herself it's the same lady like four times
[343:48.63]Who runs on the stairs?
[343:58.06]Ow.
[344:01.06]What the fuck?
[344:13.24]Ow.
[344:16.43]This goes off of way too long, too.
[344:19.65]All right, let me edit this.
[344:27.22]So, the CPR goes off.
[344:29.50]I know the CPR is going off of way too long.
[344:34.02]It comes over.
[344:34.68]Wait, wait, wait.
[344:35.76]Get over here.
[344:40.32]The CPR, first of all, needs to be in a different place.
[344:47.75]This is definitely the opener.
[344:57.03]Okay.
[344:59.25]Let's say this is fine.
[345:00.81]I'll do a little bit of a voiceover on this.
[345:07.12]We'll cut it here.
[345:09.32]Delete this.
[345:13.60]My fucking head hurts.
[345:16.41]And then this part, this is the one here.
[345:18.12]I want to cut trim here.
[345:19.64]Wait, let's just make sure.
[345:20.40]Yeah, it looks good.
[345:35.71]Yeah.
[345:41.37]All right.
[345:47.75]We'll stop it there.
[345:49.75]Right, like right here.
[346:00.11]The person kissing themself.
[346:02.97]What the hell is this?
[346:06.29]Wait, wait, why is it?
[346:07.25]I thought it was a person.
[346:08.13]Is it another alien?
[346:09.03]They're just playing.
[346:30.06]Okay, hold on.
[346:37.67]That happens way too fast.
[346:44.23]Where are the... What's wrong with the tires?
[346:45.99]I need to go get...
[346:51.91]I need to go get this.
[346:52.83]I know that one of these clips.
[346:56.23]This one here.
[347:12.68]Hold on, move this.
[347:24.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[347:25.09]Back up over here.
[347:29.57]This dance... Shit.
[347:32.36]I don't even... Alright.
[347:44.15]Here.
[347:46.19]Trim that here.
[347:46.91]Because I just want the part where he's driving forward.
[347:58.08]Maybe even a little less.
[347:59.98]Like right here, one more notch, one more notch right here.
[348:06.58]And then right there.
[348:14.12]Forward.
[348:14.50]So this is the only one that I want to keep.
[348:25.20]Now the question is, should this appear before he runs across the stage?
[348:31.41]Let's take a look.
[348:53.08]We gotta add the explosion in.
[348:59.06]Let's try it over here.
[348:59.96]Yeah, I got to move the living room as well.
[349:15.43]Come on.
[349:19.01]Let's check this.
[349:33.33]Uh... I'm still gonna have an explosion there, too.
[349:46.48]I'm gonna put an explosion here, like two of them here.
[349:49.14]Sounds.
[350:00.42]Come on, pull it.
[350:01.91]How does this look?
[350:12.05]All right, that's good.
[350:37.56]OK, hold on.
[350:41.45]Pull this back.
[350:46.15]Boom, boom, boom.
[350:47.19]Boom, boom, boom.
[350:59.79]Yeah, the fucking part with the horse and the trash everywhere.
[351:02.55]Alright, that has to be an explosion, or it sounds like...
[351:08.79]That actually kind of works pretty well.
[351:10.71]That works pretty well.
[351:25.42]These are all out of order completely.
[351:27.57]I gotta fix these.
[351:48.89]Here's the end.
[351:49.63]So we're going to start with this.
[351:58.48]Put this over here, because this is like the intro to the second game.
[352:03.60]This is like the not-in-game.
[352:07.28]It's the same lady.
[352:08.20]She's everywhere.
[352:13.89]And then we gotta get the... Clones?
[352:22.74]Yeah, the car squeeze.
[352:26.96]I don't know what happens here because there's just extras.
[352:34.29]It's gonna be four or five clowns and then all extras.
[352:50.76]They all get in again in different clothes.
[352:56.54]It's the same.
[352:57.92]That person got in twice.
[353:05.02]Less clothes.
[353:08.65]You just keep removing clothes.
[353:25.28]oh god damn it all right come over here are they even in the right car no why is this this clip doesn't ma does not I have to delete this
[354:00.29]I don't think it goes anywhere.
[354:01.37]No, no, that's bad.
[354:12.42]No, no, no.
[354:12.82]This goes first.
[354:13.42]This goes first.
[354:19.77]Clearly, clearly only one old grandma in that car.
[354:31.96]right here it shows the constant conflict that you know you're right it does show that but I need where's that other one oh right this too this right here right here we start with this
[355:05.19]And then comes through here with some music.
[355:11.38]Maybe a little bit shorter than that.
[355:12.76]Doesn't need to be that long.
[355:14.38]No in-game footage.
[355:15.66]They both are going to say it.
[355:18.64]We'll go with like here.
[355:22.92]Ugh.
[355:28.89]Alright, that's fine.
[355:29.67]Everybody gets in the car.
[355:40.13]I hate how long this is.
[355:53.56]Well, they all get in.
[355:54.46]They peel out.
[355:55.62]Let's see how this transitions together.
[355:57.48]Go, bang.
[356:04.44]Intense music flying around through the city.
[356:08.58]I'm going to put, like, loud sounds.
[356:13.08]Here's that car traffic one where there's a couple of accidents.
[356:16.98]Him stepping on the brake.
[356:22.13]No, no, no, no, no.
[356:22.61]Get over here.
[356:34.07]Let's try this.
[356:36.93]Clown Car Battle Royale.
[356:51.52]Wrong one, wrong one, wrong one.
[356:52.84]It's gotta be this way.
[356:58.77]Okay.
[357:08.68]That's so delayed.
[357:09.66]But where does he stop?
[357:10.56]No, no, no, no, no.
[357:11.31]Wait.
[357:25.81]He should start peeling out here.
[357:40.85]But he's, no, he's still going.
[357:51.44]No, he's gotta smash the brain.
[357:54.14]We did this last time.
[357:56.98]This, like, same scenario played out.
[358:13.94]Hold on, let me cut this right here.
[358:18.92]I gotta get this right because I can't go back on this.
[358:25.72]Right there.
[358:27.02]Looks good.
[358:28.36]Okay.
[358:34.96]I'm not going to get rid of that yet because if it's wrong...
[358:51.69]It's gotta be faster than that.
[358:52.89]It's gotta be like SLAM!
[358:55.07]BANG!
[359:06.82]I'm gonna put clapping and audience applause and stuff for this.
[359:21.04]The car was red.
[359:22.06]Wait, what?
[359:28.56]This is good?
[359:31.30]I can add, I can, I'm gonna add sounds later, don't worry.
[359:40.04]Wait.
[359:57.73]This is one of the other clowns.
[359:58.91]This is not even the same clown.
[360:00.03]I don't want this in.
[360:11.69]I don't think that that deserves to be in.
[360:29.37]Alright, let's start.
[360:30.27]I think that's good for cutting.
[360:38.62]Yeah, this is post-credits.
[360:44.90]Can I not put it there?
[360:48.02]Come on, I can't put that in front of the credits?
[360:56.93]Alright, well, here we go.
[361:00.11]I think this is good.
[361:09.36]Let's see if I can start recording here.
[361:23.48]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Steve Strunz.
[361:34.97]I was going to see if it worked.
[361:45.95]Welcome to the stage, President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment,
[362:01.36]What mic is it pulling from is what I want to know.
[362:07.54]I gotta have more enthusiasm than that.
[362:18.11]It's not pulling from the webcam.
[362:19.29]No, I don't think so.

[369:08.60]Welcome, everybody, to E3.
[369:15.73]I'm here to present to you two of our upcoming releases that I think you'll love.
[369:21.49]And first of all, let me just be the first to say that A3, we're here.
[369:29.17]Okay, hold on.
[369:36.87]I'm going to write this out.
[369:39.79]I'm going to write this out because it's going to be elaborate.
[369:49.71]Okay, thank you.
[369:51.21]Hey, hey, you in the back.
[369:52.25]Hey, that's who I'm talking about.
[369:54.25]Welcome to E3, everybody.
[369:56.36]We're so happy to be here.
[369:57.78]We are beyond excited to show you two new releases upcoming in our catalog of, oh my god, entertainment games.
[370:05.01]That's Osman, that's Michael, and that's Gary.
[370:09.19]The three of us are...
[370:22.77]Thank you.
[370:23.61]Hey, hey, you in the back.
[370:24.59]Hey, that's who I'm talking about.
[370:26.63]Welcome to E3, everybody.
[370:28.71]We're so happy to be here.
[370:30.16]We are beyond excited to show you two new releases upcoming in our catalog of, oh my God, entertainment games.
[370:37.38]That's Osmo, that's Michael, and that's Larry.
[370:41.59]Yeah, why is it so quiet?
[370:43.23]I don't understand why it's so quiet.
[370:57.98]Hold on, let me see.
[370:59.96]I'm going to save this for a second.
[371:05.94]Maybe I have to go into the sound options?
[371:08.16]No, I don't think anything was there.
[371:11.02]It's probably a tech error.
[371:11.99]It happens at every E3.
[371:17.25]I really would love to find a way to cut this.
[371:28.47]Yeah, right-clicking doesn't do anything.
[371:29.85]Double-clicking doesn't do anything.
[371:40.12]Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise and welcome our president and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment,
[371:50.81]Raise the volume of the game in the Windows mixer and lower the music volume from the in-game slider.
[371:56.25]Yeah, let me see.
[371:58.13]That's not a bad idea.
[372:00.30]That's a really good idea, actually.
[372:02.94]Let me save it.
[372:03.48]Hold tight.
[372:05.72]So, hold on.
[372:10.92]Let me just get in here.
[372:12.58]Let me mute this for a second.
[372:18.86]I think what I actually have to do is go, like, actually into the game, like, the mixer of the game.
[372:22.78]Yeah, like you were saying.
[372:25.74]Let's see if that does anything.
[372:32.11]Did that fix?
[372:34.31]Can you see?
[372:34.69]I wonder if that does anything.
[372:39.19]Whoa, that's loud!
[372:44.81]It's really loud for me now.
[372:48.27]Hold on.
[372:57.35]This is gonna be really loud for me, but it should be okay for you guys.
[373:00.99]Let's see.
[373:06.49]Tell me if this changes anything.
[373:16.94]And welcome our president and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment.
[373:22.07]There we go.
[373:23.47]Greg Strauss.
[373:26.65]Oh, but that's fucking loud as hell.
[373:38.99]All right, so how the fuck do I edit audio?
[374:21.23]Yeah, I can't, like, drag and, like, resize anything.
[374:26.98]I wonder if... Hold on.
[374:27.90]Can I do this?
[374:28.70]Can I just, like, break it?
[374:29.52]Let's see if I do this.
[374:35.26]No.
[374:40.06]R. Who's got the fucking phone on?
[374:48.94]Yeah, I can't like drag the audio.
[374:51.46]It just drags the whole thing.
[374:55.02]Why?
[374:56.14]I don't remember that being a problem.
[375:00.48]No, the scissors cut the clip.
[375:07.78]Audio options is just toggling on and off sound effects.
[375:13.34]What the hell?
[375:14.84]I think there's a way...
[375:17.98]This guy, I think there's like a... I don't know.
[375:29.23]The game wiki says you cannot edit the length.
[375:33.89]No.
[375:34.12]I mean, I can just... You can cancel it out with something else.
[375:42.32]I wish then I could just move it back, but no.
[375:50.40]Oh well.
[375:51.72]Just find the shortest music clip to cancel it out.
[375:54.04]R. Because I have to record over this.

[390:42.46]What does 12 start?
[390:53.18]Sorry, I'm sorry.

[390:56.11]This is the one?
[390:58.09]Well, it's gotta be in the right spot.
[391:02.06]Can you turn the phone off?
[391:04.70]You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[391:09.83]Yeah, why don't you come up here then?
[391:13.47]Oh my fucking god.
[391:22.79]Oh my god.
[391:23.86]I'm just gonna have to like leave it.
[391:26.72]It's unworkable.
[391:31.24]It just truly is.
[391:34.98]You can't use this.
[391:36.84]I'm going to have to redo everything.
[391:41.30]I'm so excited and so ready to present to you.
[391:47.60]I'm just going to do them all.
[391:48.44]I'm going to do it twice.
[391:49.60]Here we go.
[391:57.15]It's got to be done correct the first time.
[391:59.42]Our new... Cat... Can you turn the phone off?
[392:06.26]You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[392:11.39]Yeah, why don't you come up here then?
[392:13.43]Yeah.
[392:14.89]Why don't you get up here and... Record it externally?
[392:17.69]I don't think I can bring it in, can I?
[392:21.55]I'd have to restart the game.
[392:25.54]I think I'm just going too ambitious.
[392:33.00]So what was 10?
[392:33.62]No, there's nothing even here.
[392:47.33]I gotta move on from the intro.
[392:53.60]Conference, you don't turn your cell phone off?
[392:55.10]This one's fine.
[392:57.16]Yeah, why don't you come up here then?
[392:59.22]Yeah.
[393:00.64]Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?
[393:04.61]Okay, here we go.
[393:10.00]Oh my god, hold on.
[393:11.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[393:16.78]I'm in close now.
[393:22.60]I think I can do it from here.
[393:29.16]Let's grab 12.
[393:35.01]We have to just super enhance.
[393:42.20]Yeah!
[393:44.62]Oh my god.
[393:45.71]I would literally do anything to be... It's on top of it!

[394:08.01]Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?
[394:12.53]Okay, I'm fucking leaving it like this.
[394:19.20]Turn the phone off.
[394:22.68]I can grab it from here.
[394:23.76]I guess you have to have a little tail out to even select it.
[394:26.30]You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?
[394:29.17]It didn't work.
[394:31.15]Fuck you.

[394:50.19]You come to an E3 conference and you don't try to... We're stuck here forever.
[394:54.89]We're stuck in this loop forever.
[394:56.59]E3 conference and you don't try to turn your cell phone off?
[395:00.93]Yeah, why don't you come up here then?

[397:51.03]I don't have borderless windows, so I have to, like, fucking rip down every single time I want to change.
[397:54.98]You know what I mean?
[397:57.52]I can't, like, have it open and recorded at the same time.

[463:06.66]Wait, hold on.
[463:26.76]Jesus Christ!
[463:53.09]Scared me again.
[463:55.09]Scared me again.
[464:03.33]Don't you touch me.
[464:09.46]I'm not going to be part of these experiments anymore.
[464:13.20]All right, now we need like a crazier song here.
[464:25.26]Armageddon Dr. Moore's evil lab.
[464:34.50]Let's see what this sounds like No, we're gonna have like more action than that Acid base
[464:53.42]I don't think Acid Base is not long enough for this.
[464:59.09]What is going on with this Fanfare one?
[465:05.83]It's going to be loud.
[465:19.28]What are you talking about?
[465:21.43]I'm not gonna be part of your experiments anymore!
[465:47.21]This is an absolute mess.
[465:51.25]I don't even know if I can salvage this last part.
[465:59.04]Fresh sneakers.
[466:16.40]Not bad.
[466:50.93]You need laughs.
[467:07.60]Hold on.
[467:08.48]I need a laugh track.
[467:13.08]Guys, this is you guys laughing at the E3 conference.
[467:17.99]I know exactly where I can get a laugh track.
[467:22.03]with my telephone.
[467:22.81]I think this one's probably better.
[467:53.55]Lower your volume.
[468:22.90]Let us do the laugh track in the Discord server.
[468:26.52]No.
[468:36.36]You can barely hear it.
[468:38.62]It's like you're outside of E3 and you can hear this.
[468:53.56]the door opens why is that so funny just loop them and just just stack them on top of each other and this is just stupid enough to work
[469:44.13]I can't tell if this is working or just a waste of time I think it's working
[470:27.64]There's only one.
[470:30.64]It's Doom Eternal.
[470:34.62]Uh-oh.
[470:39.51]Uh-oh.
[470:43.71]Uh-oh.
[470:47.75]I saved it, right?
[470:49.65]I saved it pretty good.
[470:50.81]I got it.
[470:51.35]I saved it.
[470:51.74]It's crashed.
[470:55.85]Too many looping eternals.
[470:59.27]I saved it, like, less than five, ten minutes ago.
[471:05.01]We didn't add very much.
[471:07.98]Shit.
[471:13.78]It's alright.
[471:20.92]When I deleted World Premiere...
[471:24.05]Yeah, what else?
[471:24.99]I didn't do anything else.
[471:26.11]It wasn't that long ago.
[471:31.61]Yeah, just the music.
[471:40.19]It's just Creepy Crawler, Acid Basin, and Fresh Sneakers.
[471:45.83]I think this is hard-locked.
[471:53.20]I can't close it.
[471:58.84]What the hell?
[472:01.60]Uh-oh.
[472:03.30]Um, hold on.
[472:04.67]I just have to get my Task Manager open.
[472:12.03]Shit.
[472:14.33]No!
[472:16.73]No, I can't even end the task!
[472:21.78]Come on, please!
[472:27.92]No, it's not over.
[472:28.82]We're so close to being able to be done and watch it.
[472:32.82]This is like four hours in the making.
[472:34.46]I ain't going.
[472:35.06]Let me see if I can pull it from here.
[472:48.41]I can't get it.
[472:49.37]I'm trying to alt tab and hit task manager with alt tab.
[472:53.61]But it's going to my... It's still behind.
[472:55.69]It's on my other window.
[472:57.41]Oh, shit.
[473:01.57]Come on.
[473:02.79]Delete.
[473:04.11]Come on.
[473:06.35]Don't be completely hard locked here.
[473:07.77]Please.
[473:09.24]Please.

[473:41.13]Windows tab and make a new window in the top left.
[473:46.07]Is there any way that I can open the task manager to my other monitors?
[473:49.58]You know what I'm saying?
[473:59.70]How do I do that?
[474:02.56]Windows key plus tab.
[474:03.94]Okay.
[474:16.24]Okay, I got the Task Manager open, but I just can't use it.
[474:25.29]Task Manager.
[474:26.53]It looked like it was going to do it for a second.
[474:39.48]I can't drag it.
[474:45.52]Always on top, task manager.
[474:46.64]I don't know why mine's not up there like that.
[474:50.22]Windows key and left arrow.
[474:56.22]New desktop.
[474:59.87]New desktop.
[475:04.15]Wait, desktop one.
[475:06.55]What the hell did I just do?

[475:58.65]The first task manager is currently closed.
[476:08.31]Right click on the bottom bar and new desktop.
[476:10.12]Click task manager.
[476:11.10]All right, I'm going to try it again.

[476:35.79]Got it.
[476:36.41]We're good.
[476:38.72]You guys are seriously fucking so smart.
[476:42.92]We're back.
[476:44.42]Alright, let's open it back up.
[476:49.15]What would I do without you guys?
[476:51.41]I don't know.
[476:53.29]What would I do without you?
[477:02.07]We're getting to the end of this.
[477:03.01]I'm finishing this tonight.
[477:04.75]Because I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[477:11.24]Let's go.
[477:11.62]Uh-oh.
[477:18.76]The movie's stunts and effects was not closed properly the last time you used it.
[477:22.80]If it fails to run, you can look for a solution in the readme file.
[477:31.09]Uh-oh.
[477:35.31]Okay.
[477:40.44]Please open.
[477:42.86]It opened.
[477:43.18]Can you see it?
[477:50.46]Back in action.
[477:50.94]It's gonna be really loud.
[477:52.14]Turn your volume down.
[477:53.50]There's nothing I can do about it.
[477:54.32]Turn your volume down now.
[477:55.30]The menu here is ten times louder than the game.
[478:03.74]Warning.
[478:04.92]Oh, this is not even that bad.
[478:05.75]Okay, game.
[478:06.57]Load game.
[478:12.00]We were here, right?
[478:13.54]21, 30, wait, but P-Pants 2.
[478:16.36]Yeah, it's this one here.
[478:25.28]My, yeah, I thought, I really thought it was gonna be really loud.
[478:28.00]Usually is.
[478:31.56]Auto save or P, no, P-Pants 2.
[478:35.99]You last saved this game in 2001.
[478:37.13]I know.
[478:44.39]Here we go.
[478:59.08]Um, wait.
[479:00.50]What?
[479:00.82]Wait a minute.
[479:07.77]No, no, no, no.
[479:08.63]I saved it.
[479:11.75]I saved, like, making the video, making the movie.
[479:16.20]I think I have to be in the post-production menu, probably?
[479:20.96]Yeah.
[479:25.30]Just go into the movie.
[479:26.30]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[479:27.20]We just gotta go into where?
[479:34.03]Can I get there from here?
[479:35.37]Post-production.
[479:39.13]Should I just drag it in there?
[479:47.61]Be free, cancel, put it at home.
[479:49.45]I just gotta get into post-production, right?
[479:51.97]I'm so scared to just hit shoot this.
[479:55.35]No.
[479:55.59]No, I was very clearly... Um...
[480:15.81]It has to be sa- yeah, I mean, why would they have a save feature there?
[480:22.23]Your attention, please.
[480:23.73]The rehearsal phase of our latest movie is complete.
[480:26.63]Well, I- it's- it's- Hold on a minute.
[480:30.56]Load game.
[480:36.50]No.
[480:41.23]The autosave?
[480:42.35]No, I mean, this is- this is like the save file.
[480:49.11]File should be in the game folder.
[480:50.57]Yeah.
[480:50.99]Let me just... Let me just... Let me just get into, like, the editor and try to open it.
[481:00.82]Let me, like, just shoot this and then get into the editor.
[481:08.04]That's very sad if that's the case.
[481:11.67]Just get it into post-production and then open up from there.
[481:15.23]It has to be there.
[481:28.73]Do not overwrite it.
[481:33.30]Yeah, now just bring it to post.
[481:35.18]Right?
[481:39.60]Before... Let me just... Hold on just a second.
[481:41.40]Let me do something here.
[481:43.34]I'm gonna go into the save files and just, like, copy the one that's there right now.
[481:52.65]Hold on a second.
[481:56.91]Where would that be?
[482:00.88]Like, just in case it overwrites it or something.
[482:04.33]Let's go to... It's in my documents, right?
[482:17.52]Movies.
[482:18.92]Movies.
[482:21.18]E3 presentation is in here.
[482:25.39]I see it.
[482:35.91]It was modified at 11.39 PM.
[482:43.29]It's a configuration file.
[482:48.42]I'm going to copy both of these.
[482:49.90]There's E3Presentation and E3Presentation.TRL.
[482:59.11]And I'm gonna just paste them over here.
[483:00.71]I'm just gonna have them.
[483:07.37]There's also a couple of these.
[483:08.45]I'm just gonna copy these as well, just in case something horrible happens.
[483:14.19]And then I get- I see get out of town here as well.
[483:16.17]All right.
[483:16.73]E3 presentation configuration movies.
[483:18.97]Let me just check the other ones.
[483:20.75]Movie sounds.
[483:22.03]They're still in there.
[483:24.91]Saved games.
[483:27.42]Okay.
[483:28.18]But these are saved games, they're not configuration files.
[483:32.38]I have my E3 presentation config file here.
[483:40.15]Cross your fingers.
[483:43.60]Because we're gonna just, I'm gonna put it into post-production, see what happens.
[483:48.74]I got the, everything's backed up.
[483:50.06]Let's try to, let's see what happens.
[484:05.21]Can you go into post-production from the main menu?
[484:06.85]I don't think you can.
[484:10.35]Here we go Here we go
[484:44.64]That's not, I can't... Wait, whoa, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's right, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, this is it!
[484:54.64]It's here, it's fine, everything's done.
[484:58.14]Oh, I almost just, I almost died.
[485:00.84]I, for a second, I was so depressed because I thought that was load.
[485:07.66]Okay, so where do we leave off?
[485:18.50]Something's not right.
[485:25.08]Something's not right, guys.
[485:29.12]These are off.
[485:30.41]Somehow.
[485:42.79]I think the cuts are all gone.
[485:54.18]Are they all gone?
[485:57.02]No, they're not.
[485:58.04]Are they?
[485:59.22]Yeah, they are.
[486:01.79]All the edits are gone.
[486:07.55]Because this was not over here.
[486:14.74]This is going to screw up everything because I have to edit it again.
[486:22.15]If it was saved though, why wouldn't I be able to pull it from here?
[486:31.56]I lost a half an hour of progress?
[486:33.46]Nah, but this, some of these clips, especially like this one here, like see look at this, this was, I put these over there, this is the first thing I did.
[486:48.55]Go to main menu and post-production.
[486:50.47]I'll try it.
[486:51.95]Main menu.
[486:57.47]Can I get that from the main menu?
[487:00.79]I can't load it from here, unfortunately.
[487:02.23]It's just pulling it.
[487:04.97]The audio is here, but I'm going to edit this and it's going to get screwed up.
[487:12.77]Is there a way...
[487:16.89]Let's just see.
[487:17.57]Hold on, just get out.
[487:20.12]Main menu.
[487:21.86]See if I can- No, don't save the current game.
[487:25.93]Movie player?
[487:47.94]No, the cuts aren't here.
[487:55.75]Maybe I can't reshoot it.
[487:58.97]Let's do this then.
[487:59.95]I'm going to reload my save.
[488:08.37]No, those are the only config files that are in there.
[488:15.82]Swap out the movie files?
[488:20.29]You're talking about the ones that I... Oh yeah, let's do this.
[488:25.47]Let's try this.
[488:27.39]So... It's because I've shot the movie.
[488:30.63]Maybe.
[488:32.50]So technically, let's just see... So I have these... The presentation and the TRL both saved here.
[488:39.48]I'm going to paste these back in.
[488:42.70]And I'm not going to reshoot it.
[488:43.94]I'm literally just going to paste these back and then go to the movie player.
[488:49.80]Damn it.
[488:50.94]I'm, like, annoyed by this, but, like, at the same time... I don't know.
[488:56.35]This, like, sucks, but whatever.
[488:58.53]But hopefully this works.
[489:02.59]Let's go... I wish we could have seen the whole thing.
[489:10.57]I still could do it.
[489:11.71]I still could do it.
[489:12.51]But let's just try this.
[489:15.57]Let's go back to my documents.
[489:19.89]Go to the movies.
[489:23.49]This would be a good indicator here.
[489:25.89]If E3 presentation is 30 kilobytes and 132 kilobytes for what's in there now, what is it over here?
[489:36.68]I just burped internally.
[489:41.87]I wonder if this will change all right guys guys we have a guys I think this is going to work because they're different file sizes they're different file sizes if this works oh I'm going to p with such joy come on they're different they're not the same size that has to mean something
[490:08.49]Okay, here we go.
[490:08.87]I'm going to paste them in here.
[490:11.46]I have the originals right here.
[490:14.46]Paste them in.
[490:15.54]Replace the files.
[490:18.24]Yeah, they're different files.
[490:19.28]They're fucking different file sizes.
[490:20.56]It has to mean something.
[490:21.37]Let's go.
[490:23.15]Here we go.
[490:31.01]Oh, wait.
[490:31.24]I have to...
[490:36.14]Compact file means there's less data, which means that makes sense because I was cutting things, right?
[490:42.14]Right?
[490:43.08]Please tell me that's right.
[490:51.84]Let's see what happens.
[490:52.66]Here we go.
[491:00.34]So just from here, we're gonna go to the movie player.
[491:05.91]I'm a CS student.
[491:06.99]That's 100% correct.
[491:07.81]Let's hope so.
[491:16.13]Movie player.
[491:42.19]What is this?
[491:42.99]Load.
[491:43.29]No, none of the cuts are here.
[492:04.77]Uh... Uh...
[492:09.48]Because there was so many cuts that I did just to clean everything up.
[492:13.64]Oh, no.
[492:16.50]Like, this is... Let's just see.
[492:18.30]Hold on.
[492:19.60]Yeah, see?
[492:22.39]I did a lot of... It's time to cut.
[492:27.63]If I remember where I cut everything, it should line up in the same place.
[492:37.36]I just don't remember everything.
[492:39.56]Why is there a ghost here?
[492:40.74]No.
[492:43.57]Speedrun the movie?
[492:44.77]I'm so disappointed right now.
[492:47.29]I still have the audio.
[492:48.11]I still have the... I can hear that.
[492:55.14]I don't remember where everything was.
[492:59.40]Yes!
[492:59.78]Hilarious!
[493:01.78]Wait, that, like, still fits.
[493:03.46]That still... Alright.
[493:05.14]This is still okay.
[493:06.74]What's not okay?
[493:10.64]Wait, what?
[493:14.60]Why is that back?
[493:16.26]I saved right after doing this.
[493:21.95]I think this whole thing is fucked up.
[493:26.31]It was right before, but why... Where are the cuts, then?
[493:30.29]Am I insane, or are they here?
[493:40.97]Don't die on me!
[493:45.08]Don't you die on me!
[493:46.40]Come on!
[493:49.74]My co-captain!
[493:51.82]You're my co-pilot!
[493:57.06]Okay, I think it's still salvageable.
[494:01.61]Oh!
[494:03.70]No!
[494:06.94]I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.
[494:09.04]No, the cuts are... That was the big kicker here.
[494:12.60]I cut it here, remember?
[494:16.63]Oh!
[494:18.69]No!
[494:21.07]I'm just gonna go for it.
[494:22.31]I'm going for it.
[494:27.75]No, because look.
[494:28.35]Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
[494:29.20]That's not the right place to cut.
[494:30.26]It's over here.
[494:33.63]This might actually save the whole thing.
[494:39.09]Where was it?
[494:41.31]It was like right here, right?
[494:46.92]I'm not going to get this exact, but... Because he crashes through.
[494:57.38]Let's just do this.
[494:58.91]I know it's like...
[495:06.77]Because then the whole thing shrinks down.
[495:24.12]This cuts here.
[495:24.94]I'm getting a reading of a strange creature.
[495:32.52]I don't know what it could be.
[495:34.54]Possibly an organic compound.
[495:41.87]It's close.
[495:47.12]It was right here, I think.
[495:50.58]Right before he puts his hand on his chin.
[495:57.72]It doesn't matter.
[496:01.44]It's okay.
[496:15.10]We can have some messed up parts.
[496:16.66]It's progress, but it's gonna take a lot of time.
[496:34.71]It's still off a little.
[496:35.73]I had it so... Stupid clown laugh thing.
[496:40.07]Shit.
[496:42.47]Let me see if this whole thing's screwed up now.
[496:51.48]It's just so... off.
[496:55.26]That it's... I'm like working backwards.
[497:02.93]I'm depressed.
[497:06.19]Because I was about to, like, get this done, and now it's like... The kind of steam has left the engine here.
[497:18.37]Unfortunately.
[497:26.45]It's definitely fixable.
[497:35.77]mmm I'm so that like salty is not like mad it's not even the right word it's like let me just go back and load it again I need to see it again damn it why why why why this never happened before I've played this game before too
[498:05.30]I'm getting a reading You need to rest That what I'm not I'm so unfulfilled.
[498:19.81]This has been like such a long time coming.
[498:21.93]I'm not fulfilled at all Don't stack ten laugh tracks.
[498:28.55]Yeah, but how would I have known that that wasn't gonna break everything?
[498:31.93]I've never I would never have known that I
[498:34.05]And I was saving it too, so it's not like I'd... I mean, if a game crashes, you would assume.
[498:44.27]I think it's... Where is it?
[498:45.23]Is it right before or right after?
[498:55.32]Where the audio starts with each clip, you know where to start.
[498:57.86]Yeah, but the problem is if I cut right here...
[499:01.68]It, this is just, I did all this before putting any of the audio.
[499:05.14]And when you, every time you trim something, it moves everything.
[499:10.14]Use the VODs to see the exact timing here.
[499:12.82]All right.
[499:13.32]Here's what's going to happen with this.
[499:15.62]Here's the deal.
[499:17.16]Okay.
[499:19.46]Uh, I'm going to, because I'm playing this again with mods, I am going to off stream.
[499:27.04]I am going to finish this off stream.
[499:31.43]I'm gonna sleep.
[499:32.39]I'll come back to it.
[499:33.14]I'm gonna finish this one off stream.
[499:34.70]Have it done to watch.
[499:39.20]Because it was done.
[499:41.02]It was like pretty much done.
[499:42.04]There's like a little bit left.
[499:43.52]Like this portion here.
[499:45.46]And it was this tiny little portion over here.
[499:48.42]So because it's just getting late, then I mean, I'm not gonna lie.
[499:51.80]I'm a little disappointed.
[499:55.13]But we will watch this one on the next movie stream.
[499:58.67]Because that means that I can get out of the default ones and we can get all the weird characters and all the new props and all the new stuff.
[500:08.00]We'll open with this one.
[500:08.96]And then that'll be good because maybe the people that weren't here for this stream could just enjoy the three to four or five hours that it took to make this one.
[500:17.48]You know what I'm saying?
[500:20.45]I think that's the best plan.
[500:22.03]Because we are going on eight and a half hours here.
[500:26.16]So the plan here is I am off tomorrow.
[500:32.63]I have to make a few phone calls tomorrow.
[500:34.89]They're going to be lengthy.
[500:36.53]I can't really stream tomorrow.
[500:38.83]Tuesday or Wednesday, depending, either depends on when Star is around.
[500:44.33]Star and I are going to play Deep Rock Galactic together on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
[500:52.66]And whatever day that we do that,
[500:56.21]the movies mod stream will be the other day.
[501:00.16]So Tuesday is probably the day we're going to do it.
[501:02.24]Wednesday will be the new movies one or flip it around.
[501:05.84]We'll see.
[501:06.82]But that's the plan for the next two streams.
[501:10.96]So that's where I have to call it.
[501:13.85]I'm sorry, everybody.
[501:16.61]Kind of an all over the place stream, but I've laughed harder than I fucking have in a long time.
[501:26.04]This game is fucking hilarious.
[501:27.66]It's kind of buggy and broken as some of the stuff could be.
[501:31.61]I got at least... I got at least like 45 minutes of straight laughing.
[501:35.59]So... I hope you enjoyed it too.
[501:41.47]We will come back.
[501:43.49]Batman is a character.
[501:44.79]We're going to do like a Batman one.
[501:46.99]I might... I'll be honest with you here.
[501:50.35]I might make a couple more.
[501:53.17]to show just so you can see them without knowing what they are just before we get started on the other ones to get I kind of want to get some more experience in it maybe I'll just hang out up here tomorrow and just like chill and make a couple we'll see but thanks for watching everybody if you're uh I mean I'm gonna save it it's all right I got the files I'm just gonna go through this on my own
[502:25.51]Though, it's already saved.
[502:31.67]Yeah, I'm gonna go back to the VOD and find, like, the little exact points to cut.
[502:36.21]But that's, like, painstaking.
[502:37.25]I gotta, like, all tab and go and move and get... You don't wanna be here for that.
[502:42.01]That's really boring.
[502:43.81]I don't think I wanna put everybody through that.
[502:45.93]Especially after putting you through what I would assume was, like, 40 straight minutes of trying to figure out how to get everything to work correctly.
[502:56.41]So I do apologize again for that.
[502:58.55]But... That's where the end of the stream is going to happen.
[503:02.81]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[503:08.06]Thanks again if you came from Joel's stream.
[503:12.44]Joel, thanks for the raid again.
[503:13.44]Yeah, I can watch it on like an iPad or a phone or something.
[503:17.50]I'll get it.
[503:17.95]I'll get it.
[503:18.83]I'll get it.
[503:23.67]I need to go like this.
[503:29.43]Hey, look at that.
[503:31.41]So pardon me while I'm going to pee.
[503:33.87]I'll come back.
[503:34.29]We'll do the bits.
[503:39.99]I think the bits on another desktop.
[503:45.49]I think the bits are on a different desktop than this.
[503:49.82]Are they?
[503:54.16]Oh, no, no, no.
[503:54.64]I got him.
[503:55.02]I got him.
[503:55.42]Okay.
[503:57.06]Alright, I'll be right back.
[504:00.22]I'm going to pee.
[504:01.94]And we will close this out.
[504:04.42]Thanks for watching, guys.
[504:05.38]Be right back.
[504:53.66]Thank you.
[505:28.56]you
[506:03.92]All right, I'm back.
[506:10.36]So let's go back to earlier.
[506:15.85]We had... This is eight hours ago.
[506:19.39]Long time ago.
[506:21.25]Curly snail.
[506:21.85]Thanks for five dollars.
[506:24.09]It's been a while.
[506:24.71]Take my money.
[506:26.45]I will gladly take anything that you give me.
[506:32.10]Thank you.
[506:32.42]I really appreciate it.
[506:34.67]Thank you.
[506:36.65]Also, we had $10 from Reaper's Reviews.
[506:39.70]Just no message.
[506:41.10]$10.
[506:41.90]Thank you, Reaper's Reviews.
[506:45.66]$10 coming in.
[506:46.72]Really appreciate it.
[506:48.48]Nile Orion, thanks for $3.
[506:49.91]Great value.
[506:50.73]Jex for next Germa Rumble.
[507:00.95]That would be pretty funny, actually.
[507:03.11]I want to start working on that, too.
[507:04.93]It's been long enough.
[507:09.45]There's a lot of things I want to just do.
[507:14.99]But thank you, Niall Aurea.
[507:18.55]Uh... Yes is online, thanks for the $5.
[507:21.01]Turns out I completely forgot I made this green screen video before I moved to LA.
[507:25.51]I also got that lump in my chest checked out.
[507:27.43]It turns out it is benign.
[507:29.53]Hope your Father's Day was good.
[507:32.01]Thank you so much for the $5.
[507:32.79]And... I'm not... I... I... I... My father, I, uh... I'm gonna be seeing my father really soon.
[507:42.85]So... But that's... I'm glad that you've got that checked out and everything is... Everything's good to go.
[507:50.57]Because that shit is, you know, it's gonna be fucking scary.
[507:58.59]I'm still waiting on some biopsies, which I was told everything seems to be okay, but you know, you always just keeps you up at night sometimes.
[508:10.70]Takes a couple weeks for them to come back, two or three weeks, I think.
[508:14.55]It is like a, you know, it's a scary fucking thing.
[508:17.47]Take care of yourself.
[508:20.99]Keep yourselves in check.
[508:25.25]But, uh, green screen video.
[508:26.61]We're gonna do a green screen encore night.
[508:29.69]On the 29th of June.
[508:32.73]I'm going to hold this off until then.
[508:39.46]Chat during stream.
[508:40.78]LOL, this guy is a fucking idiot.
[508:42.46]Wow.
[508:43.20]Chat at the end of stream.
[508:44.30]Hearts.
[508:44.92]Love you, Jerma.
[508:51.53]The duality of man.
[508:56.16]No, for the most part, people are just messing around.
[508:57.96]I mean, I do some pretty stupid fucking things, so... I am not completely absolved of all crime here.
[509:13.38]But thank you so much for the video.
[509:15.48]Hold on to it, though.
[509:17.96]Over the next week or so.
[509:21.04]Probably in a couple days.
[509:24.36]At least like a week before I'll get a good idea of kind of how we want to set that up.
[509:30.44]Because I don't want like 500 videos.
[509:32.31]I kind of just want the ones that we haven't seen that have trickled through.
[509:36.45]I don't want that to be like an eight hour, four, five hundred video stream like the first one was.
[509:42.31]I'd rather that just be like a chill, you know, not like a huge, huge, huge thing.
[509:54.24]Is there more green screen footage for the Encore or do we just use the original?
[509:58.62]It's just the stuff that's there and whatever other clips that you'd want to use.
[510:04.02]But I would really like to get that so it was stuff that we missed and stuff people have made since and maybe a few others here and there.
[510:12.16]It's not going to be... It'll be a little bit more condensed.
[510:17.13]It'll be condensed.
[510:24.35]But it should be fun.
[510:27.09]That also might just be on the end of a stream.
[510:30.23]For a couple hours.
[510:31.11]You know, an hour or two.
[510:35.15]And we'll have some more details in the next three or four days.
[510:40.42]I'm going to be talking to mods in the Discord.
[510:44.44]We'll get another, probably, channel going.
[510:51.47]Not going to be a big, big thing.
[510:55.68]But thank you to Tom Sup for the $2.50.
[510:58.49]Thanks for making my night like you always do.
[511:00.93]My chest hurts from laughing and I've only been watching for an hour.
[511:06.65]Thank you.
[511:08.65]I'm glad you think it was fun.
[511:11.97]I was so... It's weird.
[511:13.27]The stream was so all over the place.
[511:16.08]I was at my most upset and at my happiest on the same day.
[511:23.34]That's weird.
[511:25.25]I was so infuriated by like two or three things that happened tonight.
[511:30.09]And it was like yin and yang tonight.
[511:35.27]When I thought I wasn't going to be able to open the expansion pack.
[511:38.51]Oh, you're talking about that's the yang.
[511:43.52]When I slurped and spit into the person's mouth I was doing CPR with.
[511:48.12]That's the yin right there.
[511:58.57]You had four miracles tonight.
[512:00.45]Yeah, I... I guess I did.
[512:09.16]The high point was the spit and slurp.
[512:10.58]I also think the bathtub.
[512:13.32]And the E3 headbutt.
[512:15.28]There was... I wish I could get that done.
[512:17.54]I'm so sad.
[512:22.11]Oh well.
[512:22.63]I can't be crying over spilled E3.
[512:26.69]Just have to clean it up.
[512:28.89]Fortnite dance, yeah.
[512:31.99]Yeah, there's some good things.
[512:37.86]But thank you.
[512:39.30]Thank you, Pajagalo, for the 10 bucks.
[512:43.00]$10.
[512:43.02]Hey, Jeremy, just checking in from our parent corporation to inform you that, as per your contract, every film you make must end with a gorilla reading a book.
[512:51.30]We had a great gorilla punchline at the end of E3.
[512:54.53]The gorilla was on Reddit angry at the E3 conference that he just watched.
[513:00.93]There was a pretty good callback there.
[513:06.24]I was happy about that one.
[513:08.36]So that technically counts.
[513:14.49]But thank you for the $10.
[513:15.01]Thank you Swiggity Swanky for the $7.
[513:19.86]I know how much you love dreams.
[513:22.01]I dreamt that I went to Germicon, but when I arrived, it was empty.
[513:26.47]It was only you and me, no one else.
[513:28.65]When I asked where everyone was, you asked me to shake your hand.
[513:32.43]But before I could do anything, you lunged at my hand and grasped it, holding it firmly.
[513:38.57]I saw my arm was merging with yours, slowly absorbing me, like from the thing.
[513:44.92]I couldn't pull away and soon became you.
[513:48.38]Now I understand why no one was at Germacon.
[513:57.60]I'm just absorbing everybody.
[514:01.22]Chat was Germa all along.
[514:03.92]Oh my god.
[514:04.98]That's fucking insane.
[514:08.57]If I ever do a meetup here in Vegas, I will not be doing that.
[514:12.53]T2000.
[514:14.81]T2000.
[514:18.16]Very detailed dreams.
[514:26.36]Uh, thank you to... Thank you to Nickname Jack for the three dollars.
[514:30.42]Haven't shown any love in a while, so here it is.
[514:32.78]Much love, Mr. Pea Pants.
[514:35.36]Thank you.
[514:38.50]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[514:44.14]We had, uh... Never Trust a Purple!
[514:48.22]Thank you, Purple, for the $10.
[514:48.88]Yo, Jerma, any plan on a three-year sub badge?
[514:53.90]Yes.
[514:55.35]There's gonna be a lot of random things added and changed on the channel.
[515:00.19]There's gonna be lots of new sub badges.
[515:02.43]There's gonna be new screens, a bunch of new music.
[515:06.97]A bunch of changes into back end of the channel.
[515:11.02]There's gonna be a lot of... There's gonna be a lot of new things here.
[515:16.38]What about a no sub badge?
[515:18.97]Yeah, I mean that that's fine.
[515:22.99]You don't have to have a sub badge You don't have to have one German default dance, but thank you purple Also DC pro thank you for the two
[515:44.52]45, but I'm going to say... I'm going to round it up.
[515:48.66]I'm tired.
[515:49.10]I'm rounding it up.
[515:51.50]Thank you.
[515:53.34]Father's Day always sucks for me, but last night's stream and tonight's stream got me through the weekend.
[515:56.84]Thank you, Jeremiah.
[515:57.44]Hope all is well.
[516:04.66]I'm sorry to hear that.
[516:05.36]I'm sorry to hear that Father's Day is not a good day for you.
[516:09.51]But... We've got a community of fun little jokesters here.
[516:18.62]And I'm sitting here talking about this fun, great community of people.
[516:22.24]And they're so interesting and so helpful and so great.
[516:25.46]How about another streamer?
[516:26.62]Replace the streamer.
[516:28.16]What about a new streamer?
[516:29.14]This one is... How do we get rid of... Find a new host.
[516:33.78]Come on.
[516:40.24]Any plan on new emotes?
[516:41.74]Yeah.
[516:42.81]There'll be like five new emotes.
[516:46.83]Maybe more.
[516:49.58]I want to redo the tier 2 and tier 3 emotes.
[516:54.83]Because they're dog shit or they don't exist.
[516:58.21]Do I even have any tier 2?
[516:59.75]Are they gone?
[517:00.17]I think I have one.
[517:02.59]No, I don't have any tier 2 or tier 3.
[517:04.33]I was going to change them.
[517:12.24]Wait, is the golden BS still?
[517:15.24]Oh yeah, golden BS is still tier 2.
[517:19.45]Tier 3 is gonna be just something stupid.
[517:21.95]But there's gotta be something there, at least.
[517:23.45]There are, like... There are a handful of Tier 3 subs, so... I obviously don't want to, uh... Just not have anything.
[517:42.39]I don't know why I played that.
[517:43.51]The tab was open?
[517:46.12]And I'm closing tabs, getting ready to end the stream, and I just figured I would press the button.
[517:54.02]What is this?
[517:56.70]Oh, that's Audacity.
[518:01.49]Never mind.
[518:04.43]What a shitshow.
[518:06.29]What a fucking shitshow.
[518:07.31]That beginning, it took me so long.
[518:08.77]That's probably when Joel came in with the raid, too, and I'm just sitting there going...
[518:13.83]I can't do it!
[518:14.57]Like screaming and then headbutting some lady.
[518:20.69]So excited.
[518:21.95]So excited.
[518:34.76]Edit all the clips in Audacity.
[518:36.52]Yeah, I'll clean it up.
[518:37.92]I'll clean it up.
[518:42.26]But that's going to be it.
[518:43.57]I'm going to roll the credits.
[518:44.57]There's a couple more bits that came through, but I just want to make sure I get the credits rolling.
[518:47.27]A lot of subs tonight.
[518:51.85]That's pretty usual.
[518:53.11]I mean, there's a lot of subs every night.
[518:54.89]So thanks, guys.
[518:57.58]Yeah, Joel raided, like, a few hours ago?
[518:59.82]Two or three hours ago?
[519:06.44]There's a lot of people that are continuously subscribed to this channel.
[519:11.08]Month to month, day to day.
[519:12.50]Week to week.
[519:13.98]Year to year.
[519:16.65]Thanks.
[519:19.75]I will see you all on Tuesday.
[519:24.85]And Wednesday's stream is going to be the last one for a little while.
[519:30.20]Visiting family and getting some work done on a stream.
[519:36.58]So I will be working.
[519:38.80]I will be.
[519:40.34]Just won't be on camera.
[519:45.70]And let's get the last couple of bits that came in here.
[519:50.09]They are... No, I think I got them all.
[519:55.90]I got them all.
[520:01.14]Thanks for the laughs you've given us.
[520:02.24]Watching you broadcast E3 while at E3 was oddly one of the most hilarious things I've ever done.
[520:07.54]Thank you for everything and take care.
[520:08.69]I think that was a creamy sensation.
[520:09.95]Thank you.
[520:12.77]Watching you broadcast E3 while at E3?
[520:17.43]Hold on, wait a minute.
[520:22.55]You were watching me broadcast E3 while you were sitting at E3?
[520:29.35]That had to have been interesting.
[520:35.58]Yes, it is the dunk tank.
[520:37.24]And I'm going to give you... Because this is 1230, 1240.
[520:43.03]At the very least, it's the dunk tank.
[520:44.53]And if you don't know what I'm talking about, let's just talk about it for a second.
[520:48.51]Might as well.
[520:50.21]Because this is the last time I probably will talk about it until you see it or until we have to test some things.
[520:56.61]But the dunk tank stream, if you weren't here or don't know what I'm talking about, I'm going to get a dunk tank.
[521:04.94]And not just a dunk tank.
[521:06.96]Because at this point, I want to do more.
[521:10.64]But we are at the very least going to try.
[521:13.34]Very desperately.
[521:14.78]Because I do have somebody who is very knowledgeable now.
[521:17.36]I have like an actual robotics team that I'm emailing back and forth with.
[521:21.73]I have some calls with.
[521:23.91]And I'll be meeting with other people too.
[521:26.89]So the dunk tank is going to be potentially me up there.
[521:33.13]I've got a dunk tank expert.
[521:36.04]There's gonna be a pitching machine that is going to be attached to a robot, which you will be controlling.
[521:43.30]To try to dunk me.
[521:46.56]On top of that... On top of that... I'm going to probably try to do other games.
[521:57.86]Like a claw machine that you guys control.
[521:59.61]Like a little carnival.
[522:03.31]I'm going to try.
[522:05.23]This could be a catastrophic failure.
[522:08.98]But if I get the green light, if I do over these next five to ten days, because this is what I'm going to be working on.
[522:18.76]If I get the legit green light here, I'm going to focus on it almost completely.
[522:27.03]So that's the plan.
[522:30.21]If the plan works or not, we'll find out.
[522:35.29]That is what I'm going to be trying to do.
[522:37.63]And the reason why I'm talking about it now and alluding to it is because we're going to have to test some stuff.
[522:44.09]You're going to see in the chat room, randomly, probably like me and other people and mods and stuff, like pressing buttons and you're not going to have any idea what the hell is going on.
[522:55.72]So I want you to be aware of it.
[523:05.73]Because I cannot just turn it on and be like, let's see if it works.
[523:12.21]No, no, no.
[523:13.17]I'm going to make sure this works because I'll be putting probably some cash into this.
[523:25.86]We'll see.
[523:29.22]Hopefully it's not wasted time.
[523:33.43]Wish me luck.
[523:37.86]But thank you, everybody, for watching.
[523:40.29]I'll see you on Tuesday.
[523:45.63]And we'll play some more games.
[523:47.51]Star and I are going to do something and you'll see some modded... I almost said The Sims 4.
[523:52.37]May as well be.
[523:54.55]Have a great night.
[523:55.97]See you Tuesday.
[523:57.34]Take care, guys.
[523:58.38]Goodbye.
