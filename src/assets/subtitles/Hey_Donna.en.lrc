[02:28.14]Ludwig.
[02:28.80]Well, whatever, you know.
[02:30.34]It's a pronunciation.
[02:31.11]Potato, potato.

[02:52.69]Applause!
[02:56.63]You gotta whip him into shape.
[02:59.05]Hey, what did that Ludwig do to his hair?
[03:02.35]He looks like a baseball player from the Dominican Republic with that hairdo.
[03:06.64]I think it looks nice.
[03:08.06]It looks hot.
[03:08.72]I like it.
[03:09.70]Please, not this one.
[03:11.41]Oh, I mean, I mean, if he's interested, he's interested.
[03:14.81]He's not interested.
[03:15.49]He's very much so taken.
[03:16.53]Oh, I'll put the lewd back in the wig.
[03:18.47]You know what I mean?
[03:19.01]No, you don't need to do any of that.
[03:21.31]Oh, my God.
[03:21.77]It's so good to have you here.
[03:22.92]So good to have you here.

[03:58.80]Apparently there was already a 1-800-HEY-Donna.
[04:01.14]How that happens, I'll never know.
[04:02.91]What does that go to?
[04:04.07]There's some other bitch named Donna out there answering phone calls right now.
[04:07.77]And if I find her, I'm gonna put her in the bottom of the Hudson Bay.
[04:13.11]Alright, I'm sorry.

[04:35.18]That sounds amazing.
[04:37.12]Yeah.
[04:38.00]I learned what a gif is.
[04:39.14]You know what a gif is?
[04:40.62]I do.
[04:41.30]I know what a gif is.
[04:42.20]Yeah.
[04:42.64]I know a lot of things.
[04:43.76]Actually, it's pronounced jif.
[04:45.40]It's pronounced jif?
[04:46.34]Yeah, you should say that to people.
[04:47.66]Oh, yeah, it's going to have all kinds of jifs.
[04:49.98]Perfect.

[05:05.44]We have another amazing guest.
[05:06.49]He's not here yet, but we have the incredible, the amazing, the brilliant web creator, the Andy Kaufman of Twitch, Jerma.
[05:17.99]How do you know Jerma?
[05:19.25]How do I know?
[05:20.60]Listen, I'm a big fan of his work.
[05:22.74]Yeah?
[05:23.38]What's something he's done?
[05:25.10]He's a big doll guy, I hear.
[05:28.28]He plays with dolls, right?
[05:29.76]Did you bring any dolls for him?
[05:31.18]No, but he did something with dolls, right?
[05:33.34]A big doll?
[05:34.18]He does love dolls.
[05:35.07]Yeah, like the world's biggest dollhouse or something?
[05:37.77]Guys and dolls is the main character.
[05:39.95]Oh, he's in the show tunes.
[05:41.95]Yep.
[05:42.67]Oh.

[05:43.25]Yeah.
[05:43.81]Yeah, sing one.
[05:45.85]Oh, I have too many in my head.
[05:48.79]Guys and dolls, we're just a bunch of crazy guys and dolls.
[05:52.57]That's good.
[05:52.89]Save it for Jerma.
[05:53.43]Should I sing for him?
[05:54.41]Yeah.
[05:54.75]You like it?
[05:55.35]I like it.
[05:55.63]Alright, I'll sing for him.
[05:56.57]I'm excited.
[05:57.45]It's kind of hot, too.
[05:58.61]Well, you have got to relax.
[06:00.49]Well, I'm just pointing.
[06:02.26]I mean, come on.
[06:02.94]I'm pointing out the obvious here.
[06:08.44]Jerma's pissing right now.
[06:09.80]Oh.
[06:11.04]That's good.
[06:11.74]I didn't.
[06:12.44]Oh, sorry.
[06:12.94]I wasn't supposed to say that.
[06:14.14]OK.
[06:14.26]The producer just told me that.
[06:15.74]Sorry.
[06:16.94]Anyway, what's been going on in your life?
[06:19.12]Not much.
[06:20.02]Hey, you did a girl's trip, right?
[06:21.47]Uh-huh, I went on a girl's trip.
[06:24.03]Oh, that's interesting.
[06:27.03]Everybody was there, huh?
[06:30.03]You know, you wouldn't have liked it.
[06:32.67]It was a Christian girl's trip.
[06:35.69]Oh.
[06:36.29]Yeah, lots of praying.
[06:37.57]Yeah, I'm sure Minx was just praying when she jumped through that table, huh?
[06:43.24]She was overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit.
[06:44.66]She was praying not to hurt herself, I'll tell you what.
[06:48.20]I guess my invite just got lost in the mail.
[06:50.08]It was a little.
[06:51.46]Pray for it next year.
[06:53.48]I'll get right on that.
[06:54.60]Perfect.
[06:56.00]Maybe you can show me how to get on my knees.
[06:57.80]Hey, wait a minute.
[06:59.06]We got a guest here.
[07:00.66]We got the amazing Jeremiah.
[07:02.12]Everybody clap.
[07:03.14]Hello.
[07:04.28]Hello.
[07:05.28]Oh, my god.
[07:05.80]It's you.
[07:06.12]How are you?
[07:06.74]Oh, Donna.
[07:06.98]It's such a wonderful time to see you.
[07:08.94]Yes.
[07:09.72]Sit here?
[07:10.32]Yeah, you may sit there.
[07:11.64]OK, sit here.
[07:12.48]Now, I hear you put on the biggest production of Guys and Dolls Twitch has ever seen.
[07:17.38]Well, you know, a bit close.
[07:18.72]It's the Dollhouse.
[07:19.91]Alright.
[07:20.53]Now, why?
[07:21.33]It was just a big dollhouse?
[07:23.99]So it was a multi-level dollhouse structure.
[07:26.75]Alright.
[07:27.07]We brought a bunch of people over.
[07:28.59]We did a big show, and it was a lot of fun.
[07:31.31]It was probably the most fun I've ever had in my entire life.
[07:33.11]Okay, can you explain a little bit what that means, multi-level doll?
[07:36.52]So, picture a house cut in half.
[07:38.92]Alright, I'm picturing it.
[07:39.92]And you're walking around in it.
[07:41.20]Yeah.
[07:41.52]There's a bathroom.
[07:42.54]Alright.
[07:42.94]Only one bathroom.
[07:43.79]She's used cowboy houses.
[07:46.03]Oh.
[07:47.61]Okay.
[07:47.83]Alright, listen.
[07:49.63]You take one little trip to Betty Ford, everybody acts like it's the end of the road.
[07:53.87]She understands.
[07:54.43]She understands.
[07:55.01]Alright, keep going.
[07:55.61]Sorry.
[07:56.07]So it was a big house cut in half.
[07:58.43]Yeah.
[07:59.01]And in that house, we put people.
[08:00.76]And in those people, they had a lot of interactions, and they had a lot of fun.
[08:05.30]So it was a bear.
[08:06.14]There was a bear attack.
[08:06.78]How is this different than any other house?
[08:08.78]Well, do you get attacked by a bear in regular houses?
[08:11.38]No.
[08:12.38]I mean, outside of Siberia, I guess.
[08:14.20]Have clowns ever attacked you in your house?
[08:16.34]No.
[08:16.78]Have they ever eaten your peanut butter?
[08:18.81]With their bare hands?
[08:19.43]Actually, yes, one time.
[08:20.53]But that was, I was working as a carny at the time.
[08:23.53]Yeah, right, okay.
[08:24.21]Makes sense.
[08:24.91]I spread pixie dust on the filter bottle.
[08:28.43]Are these real?
[08:28.85]Are these real phones?
[08:30.78]No.
[08:30.92]Oh, okay.
[08:31.56]Alright, Jeremy, you know what we do here.
[08:33.22]Yeah, oh yeah.
[08:34.14]We take calls, we help people.
[08:35.94]Okay, I can do that.
[08:36.52]You're a pretty worldly guy, I hear.
[08:37.92]I'm excited for what advice you have to offer these people.
[08:41.64]I feel like I've got a lot.
[08:42.76]Yeah.
[08:44.18]Alright.
[08:45.25]Let's take our first call.
[08:46.79]Let's take a call.
[08:47.33]Oh, that was quick.
[08:49.69]That was immediate.
[08:52.37]You summoned it.
[08:53.08]Hello, this is Donna.
[08:54.48]Can I help you?
[08:56.74]Hey, Donna.
[08:57.22]This is John from New York on 26th.
[09:00.46]And I'm having this issue that has me really confused and concerned about what I should do.
[09:08.78]Alright.
[09:09.34]It sounds like you're talking into a walkie-talkie a little bit here, John.
[09:13.18]But what's your issue?
[09:16.11]So, yeah, I fell in love with my best friend, basically.
[09:19.87]We've been friends for years.
[09:22.28]It started because we were coworkers and we had common interests.
[09:27.46]She knows I had a little bit of like a friend crush on her.
[09:31.34]She was aware of that.
[09:32.90]but yeah we we have like all the same friends now and her family and everything and I just don't really know what to do or if I should do anything because I don't want to mess up the friendship wow so did you always have these feelings or do these feelings just sneak up on you like Dr. disrespect in the bathroom yeah pretty much yeah yeah when did they sneak up on you uh fairly recently honestly
[10:00.22]So yeah.
[10:00.90]So what was happening when you started experiencing feelings?
[10:03.87]They don't just come out.
[10:04.61]Something had to happen.
[10:07.07]Honestly, we watched movies, and a lot of the stuff that was happening in the movies kind of was very similar to our friendship.
[10:15.23]And it made me just think about it way more.
[10:19.09]So you went to a movie, and it inspired you to make a move on your best friend.
[10:23.09]What movie was this?
[10:24.09]Yeah, what was the movie?
[10:24.75]That's very important.
[10:25.47]That's very important.
[10:27.58]Uh, honestly, Thor love and thunder?
[10:30.88]No, I can't believe you've done this.
[10:32.92]I can't believe you've done this.
[10:34.64]Thor inspired you to make a move on your best friend of five years.
[10:39.29]Pretty much, yeah.
[10:40.83]There's a lot of movies that inspire things, like the movie Trainwreck in your life.
[10:45.13]OK.
[10:46.05]Alright.
[10:47.51]Thank you for that.
[10:48.23]Do you have any advice for him, or are you just going to rag on me all day?
[10:50.65]I have good advice.
[10:51.71]Alright, hit him.
[10:52.65]I am currently dating one of my coworkers.
[10:56.81]Yeah, we all know.
[10:58.31]Ludwig.
[11:00.37]Very 6'5", and chiseled, and very handsome.
[11:03.63]Just throwing that out there, not to make you jealous.
[11:07.59]Did you say Ludwig is 6'5"?
[11:10.76]Ludwig is 6'5".
[11:12.38]What, if he stands on his wallet?
[11:14.99]Exactly.
[11:15.65]That's a pretty big wallet.
[11:16.91]Yeah, it's a big wallet.
[11:18.73]And, you know, I think at first we were friends for a very, very long time.
[11:23.77]Right.
[11:25.33]And then one day he... Took you to Thor Love and Thunder.
[11:32.78]Took me to Thor Love and Thunder.
[11:33.96]Took you to the Thor movie.
[11:34.74]And then made a move.
[11:35.76]I actually, that's a great question.
[11:37.40]I don't know how we went from friends to more than that.
[11:42.57]I don't know where my advice is going.
[11:44.85]Oh, wow.
[11:45.27]I'm so glad to have you back.
[11:46.59]You're welcome.
[11:47.15]You really slam dunked that one.
[11:49.09]You literally went through the life experience he needs and you forgot it.
[11:53.20]I wanted to brag.
[11:54.12]Mid-answer.
[11:55.75]Alright.
[11:56.49]Jeremy, you got any advice for this young man?
[11:57.97]I do have some advice.
[11:58.71]OK.
[11:59.07]Sure.
[11:59.47]So how long have you been friends for, you said?
[12:02.22]Five years.
[12:02.76]Five years.
[12:03.30]OK.
[12:03.86]So you know each other very well.
[12:05.78]You know each other very well.
[12:07.80]I would honestly, you know, you just kind of have to gauge it, right?
[12:10.88]You bring it up very, you know, hey, I just want to let you know that we've been friends for a long time.
[12:16.89]I just want to know maybe if I have potential feelings for you.
[12:20.25]If you have feelings for me, that's great.
[12:21.51]If not, then that's no big deal.
[12:22.99]Like, then we can still be friends.
[12:24.25]I just want to kind of gauge how you feel.
[12:26.38]Yeah.
[12:26.54]You know, that's good advice, gauging it out.
[12:30.36]One thing I would say, don't mention that it was a Marvel movie that inspired you to make the movie.
[12:35.88]Absolutely not.
[12:36.82]I don't know how she would take that.
[12:38.58]It's not the most romantic thing I've ever heard.
[12:40.72]Maybe a myth.
[12:41.48]She loves Marvel.
[12:42.72]Yeah, she doesn't love it that much.
[12:45.67]Alright, maybe I'll admit that.
[12:47.91]So, you know, I think Jerma makes a good point.
[12:50.39]You gotta approach this honestly.
[12:52.15]You gotta have a conversation.
[12:53.39]You've known her for five years.
[12:54.53]You know her intimately.
[12:55.85]You know kind of how best to approach this situation.
[13:00.10]But obviously, the elephant in the room is that when you let out that you have a physical attraction to this person, that might make her feel uncomfortable in the future because, you know, there's no way to put those worms back in the can.
[13:13.99]It's hard to talk about, hey, did you see Game of Thrones?
[13:17.53]When in her mind, she's like, I wonder if he's thinking about my boobs right now.
[13:20.31]You know what I mean?
[13:20.81]So you gotta approach it from an emotional standpoint and you gotta say to her, listen, I can't help this, but I think I've developed some kind of feelings beyond our friendship.
[13:30.86]Would you be open to discuss that?
[13:32.70]If not,
[13:33.48]you know, I'm so sorry, I will take a step back.
[13:35.91]I don't wanna jeopardize our friendship at all.
[13:38.09]But I think you have to approach that from a very honest place, and you gotta approach it slow.
[13:43.51]You know what I mean?
[13:44.35]And maybe, if she reciprocates those feelings, you go right into She-Hulk and you just see where the next Marvel project takes this, you know what I mean?
[13:55.50]Anything else?
[13:57.00]Cutie, do you remember your real life experience of how 6'5 Ludwig swept you off your feet?
[14:02.18]He's just so handsome.
[14:03.40]Are you handsome, by chance?
[14:06.85]I like to think I am.
[14:08.23]He's handsome.
[14:08.67]You'll be fine.
[14:09.69]Yeah, you'll be fine.
[14:11.37]But don't make it weird.
[14:12.23]You know what I mean?
[14:13.41]Like, don't make it weird.
[14:14.87]Don't make it weird.
[14:16.12]Yeah, and I think you know what that means, right?
[14:18.14]If you want to give, yeah, if you want to just let them know, hey, yeah, I think I might have some feelings.
[14:24.36]I just want to see if it's reciprocated.
[14:26.44]And I don't want to be weird, right?
[14:28.23]I'm not trying to make this weird.
[14:29.85]You know what I think will help?
[14:32.15]Let's workshop this.
[14:33.43]Do you want to write the text?
[14:35.05]Why don't we do a text?
[14:35.61]Do you want to do a text write?
[14:36.63]No, no, no, no.
[14:37.09]Here's what we're going to do.
[14:40.01]Jerma, we've been friends with Cutie Cinderella for a long time.
[14:43.08]Yeah?
[14:44.20]You've just seen the most recent Marvel movie.
[14:46.56]Okay.
[14:47.26]And you've got to tell her you've got a burning desire to be with her.
[14:49.74]And scene.
[14:50.80]Go.
[14:53.58]Oh, that movie sucked.
[14:54.84]Okay.
[14:55.18]I hated every second of it.
[14:57.25]Spider-Man Homecoming was way better.
[14:58.93]What do you think?
[14:59.29]I...
[15:02.77]Marvel, Marvel.
[15:04.31]Yeah, so I think there could've been more of the Joker in the last one.
[15:08.39]That's DC.
[15:09.51]This is just not gonna work.
[15:10.53]DC what?
[15:10.93]This is not gonna work.
[15:12.11]I just don't think it's gonna work.
[15:13.43]Sorry, it's not gonna work out.
[15:15.36]It's DC.
[15:15.58]Doesn't even know the Marvel movies.
[15:18.32]Moving on.
[15:18.72]Doesn't even know the Marvel movies.
[15:19.82]I gotta educate my niece on who's in what cinematic universe.
[15:23.10]Goodbye.
[15:25.76]That was tough to watch.
[15:27.22]The Joker?
[15:29.58]He's Batman.
[15:31.50]Yeah, superheroes.
[15:33.12]Oh, my God.
[15:34.34]Don't worry.
[15:35.35]It'll take like another $6 or $7 billion for them to do that movie.
[15:39.35]Yeah.
[15:39.95]You date one of the world's most famous nerds, and you don't know what's Marvel and what's DC?
[15:45.29]We're connected to the Wi-Fi.
[15:46.51]I don't know why you're saying DC.
[15:48.19]Alright.
[15:48.73]OK.
[15:51.49]Listen, we got plenty more amazing advice coming up after the break.
[15:56.03]You put your butts right there.
[15:57.35]When we come back, we got even more calls with the amazing Jerma and my niece, Cutie Cinderella, here for the first time.
[16:02.41]She's amazing.
[16:04.04]That was good advice.
[16:05.36]That was good advice.
[17:58.02]Welcome back, everybody!
[18:00.00]You're watching Hey Donna!
[18:03.79]1-833-HEY-Donna because we couldn't get 1-800.
[18:07.33]Yeah, there it is.
[18:08.41]We couldn't get 1-800.
[18:09.81]Some other bitch named Donna really wanted that number.
[18:12.35]We're gonna find her.
[18:13.95]We're gonna find her.
[18:14.61]Anyway.
[18:16.37]Just call it.
[18:17.28]What?
[18:17.78]You just call it.
[18:18.44]You'll find her if you just call it.
[18:19.78]Call 1-800-Donna?
[18:20.98]1-800?
[18:21.60]No!
[18:22.04]You don't even know it's Hey, Donna.
[18:23.56]Listen!
[18:24.42]I'm doing my best.
[18:25.08]You're throwing things at me.
[18:28.50]You're supposed to help me out here.
[18:31.38]I'm old.
[18:33.57]Old?
[18:33.79]You're not how old?
[18:34.79]What do you mean, old?
[18:35.45]Not a day over 30.
[18:37.87]No, it doesn't.
[18:38.61]You don't look a day over at least 30, 40.
[18:40.59]Oh, thank you.
[18:42.13]My age is unknown, even to me.
[18:43.70]Alright, we're going to take another call.
[18:45.72]Let's bring it in.
[18:47.42]Oh, look at that.
[18:48.86]Hello?
[18:51.25]Hi, my name is Laura.
[18:52.94]I'm 27, and I live near Chicago.
[18:54.18]Hello, Laura, 27, from Chicago.
[18:55.20]Go, Cubs, go.
[18:56.18]Hey.
[19:02.45]So I am looking for some career advice today.
[19:05.39]Oh, well, you've come to the right place.
[19:07.85]I'm so glad.
[19:08.89]I need it desperately.
[19:10.14]So I am just now starting to apply for jobs again after leaving a really great position and career path during the pandemic so that I could help my family with some health challenges.
[19:21.07]Alright.
[19:21.81]So I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately just trying to decide what to do next.
[19:26.15]I know that you guys have all done a lot of different things professionally.
[19:30.11]Right.
[19:30.31]So I'm wondering what advice you might have for someone transitioning to a new career path and how to feel confident doing so.
[19:37.32]Wow.
[19:38.18]This is a good question.
[19:39.40]Can I ask a little bit more about the career?
[19:41.97]Absolutely.
[19:42.63]What's given you anxiety about it?
[19:44.13]Is it because it's a step up?
[19:45.53]Is it because it's demanding?
[19:47.81]What?
[19:48.69]So I think I'm going from something where I felt really confident in my path forward.
[19:53.66]I got my bachelor's and then my master's degree.
[19:56.66]Thought I was going to be doing one thing for a really long time.
[19:59.40]Sure.
[19:59.94]And it just would be too demanding given the personal challenges right now.
[20:04.11]Yeah.
[20:05.37]So I think I am feeling like
[20:07.31]It might not necessarily be a step down, but I'm making lateral moves where I might just have to transition to a different career.
[20:14.54]Got it.
[20:16.10]And it's just the first time I'm doing that, so kind of.
[20:18.50]So are you excited about this shabanon?
[20:22.42]Well, I don't know, because I have about, you know, 100 tabs open on my computer looking at different job applications that I could do.
[20:30.79]So it's more just trying to figure out what I want going forward.
[20:35.31]Whoa.
[20:35.59]Because it's the first time that I've kind of had all those options open.
[20:38.95]Alright.
[20:39.47]This is really real.
[20:41.21]Jeremy, you're a man who's worn many hats in your life.
[20:44.49]A few.
[20:45.59]I feel like you might have some good advice for this young lady.
[20:48.70]I mean, honestly, the best thing I could say is always have at least three things that you care about.
[20:53.96]So doing any one of those things is fulfilling.
[20:56.66]Yeah.
[20:57.20]So whether it's, oh, I'd like to be a writer, I'd like to be a veterinarian, or I always have three interests that you can always do, and you will always be fulfilled, even if the other two don't work out.
[21:08.24]There you go.
[21:09.26]Always try to have a few.
[21:10.14]Have some fallbacks.
[21:11.58]Thank you.
[21:14.33]If your job you were just at was too demanding, what kind of job do you want that's less, like what are you looking for work week wise?
[21:26.97]Well, ideally, right now I'm hoping for something that would either be remote or hybrid just to help with what's going on at home.
[21:35.15]But I think eventually I'm looking to move back forward in my career, move up again.
[21:40.23]And so I am hoping for something that has some upward momentum.
[21:45.13]Hmm, I see.
[21:47.21]I mean, I think it depends a lot on the career path you wanna go to.
[21:51.53]If you just wanna make a lot of money, if you wanna just quit and become a streamer and play video games all day.
[21:57.57]Oh yeah.
[21:58.11]That's what I did.
[21:59.19]If you wanna start a Fansly, it's a great option.
[22:02.33]If you just want easy work or hard work.
[22:05.69]Yeah.
[22:06.03]Gotcha.
[22:07.29]Don't quit your job and play video games.
[22:09.57]Don't do that.
[22:12.43]Listen, I can tell you got a lot going on in this question because it sounds like you're not just thinking about what job works for you.
[22:21.60]You're thinking about what job works for the people around you, too.
[22:25.44]Because it sounds like you're putting a lot on your plate.
[22:28.22]And I think what ultimately is going to fulfill you the most is what makes you happy.
[22:35.69]And I think you're considering a lot of other people's feelings.
[22:38.73]But I'm gonna tell you this, your family, they love you.
[22:42.01]And they're gonna wanna see you happy.
[22:43.88]And your family is more flexible than you think.
[22:46.44]They're gonna make things work, right?
[22:48.74]So whatever career is the one that makes you happy, is the one that's gonna make them happy too.
[22:53.94]And you might have to give and take and, you know, make some changes or make some things more flexible, but your family is going to support you through that because you've supported them.
[23:04.29]So that's the best thing I can say.
[23:06.13]Obviously, sometimes reality doesn't match up with what you want to do, but I'm telling you, find the one that fulfills you.
[23:12.31]Alright?
[23:13.79]And make sure there's a few of them.
[23:15.13]Make sure there's a few of them.
[23:15.91]And make sure there's a few of them.
[23:17.13]That's right.
[23:17.93]Always have the veterinarian in your back pocket.
[23:20.51]That's true.
[23:21.85]Hey, I still got that.
[23:23.15]I still got that.
[23:24.67]This whole streaming thing doesn't work out.
[23:26.51]I've got to be a veterinarian.
[23:28.07]He's going to be fixing giraffe ankles before you can blink.
[23:32.01]I would trust him with my pet.
[23:33.65]Quit my job to play video games.
[23:35.54]There you go.
[23:36.92]Well, anyway, you sound like an absolute angel.
[23:39.24]I hope I've helped you, and I wish you the best, my dear.
[23:42.56]Thank you, guys.
[23:43.22]This was so helpful.
[23:44.28]Really appreciate it.
[23:45.26]Thank you so much.
[23:47.44]Quit your job and play video games?
[23:48.74]That's what I do.
[23:49.34]That's what I do.
[23:50.50]What are you doing?
[23:51.91]What do you mean?
[23:53.27]Quit your job and play video games.
[23:56.29]You think that's bad advice?
[23:57.45]Yeah.
[23:58.17]Well, you keep the job.
[23:59.01]You play the video games.
[23:59.95]And if the video games turns out alright, then you quit the job.
[24:02.33]You're telling me that if I quit my job to play video games that maybe I won't be successful?
[24:10.17]Yeah.
[24:10.65]Well, uh.
[24:11.41]There's a chance of that?
[24:12.59]I've seen you play video games.
[24:17.15]What's your ELO in League of Legends again?
[24:20.53]How many hours have you put in that game?
[24:21.77]It's probably higher than mine.
[24:22.97]I'm dead serious.
[24:23.65]I don't think so.
[24:24.73]Oh, no, it absolutely is.
[24:25.69]No, I don't believe it is.
[24:27.09]I don't think it is either.
[24:28.79]Alright, let's go ahead.
[24:30.64]Is there a free rotation in League of Legends?
[24:32.74]Because I've opened it maybe one time.
[24:35.80]I've played for thousands of hours for the last seven years.
[24:38.96]Yeah, it's going well.
[24:42.05]Listen, let's move on from video games and get right into our celebrity horoscope.
[24:47.25]Here's a graphic.
[24:50.77]Ooh, that's a good graphic.
[24:58.45]Listen, this is your horoscope.
[24:59.85]Have you ever had your astrology?
[25:01.49]This is my horoscope.
[25:02.41]This is your horoscope.
[25:03.96]Okay.
[25:04.80]I'm ready to hear it.
[25:05.64]You're about to learn a lot about yourself, baby.
[25:08.06]I hope I don't get hit by a bus in like an hour.
[25:10.22]No.
[25:10.94]Okay.
[25:11.32]It's not on here.
[25:12.28]It's not on there?
[25:12.94]Not on there.
[25:13.42]You're safe.
[25:14.34]Good.
[25:14.46]You could just cross the road without looking.
[25:16.48]Alright.
[25:16.76]That sounds good to me.
[25:17.38]Alright.
[25:17.88]Your birthday is September 22nd.
[25:19.52]That's correct.
[25:20.88]It's coming up soon.
[25:22.12]It's also Hobbit Day.
[25:24.47]Hobbit Day.
[25:25.13]Yeah, I'm gonna get in front of that one.
[25:26.57]I'm gonna get in front of that one.
[25:27.39]What is that?
[25:28.34]Is that like Burger Day?
[25:29.60]Do people eat hobbits on that day?
[25:31.18]No, it's like the Lord of the Rings Hobbit Celebration Day.
[25:35.38]Ah, Mizkiff Day.
[25:37.22]Ah, there you go.
[25:38.10]Oh, yeah.
[25:38.86]Wow, shots fired.
[25:40.17]Mizkiff's catching strays, which means you are a Virgo on the cusp of a Libra.
[25:45.35]Okay.
[25:45.85]Yep, you have a Virgo sun and a Capricorn moon.
[25:49.25]Makes you very grounded.
[25:51.40]I don't know, that doesn't sound like you.
[25:52.64]That doesn't sound like me.
[25:53.32]You're a head up in the clouds type of guy.
[25:55.22]I sometimes walk around with both shoes untied for hours at a time.
[25:58.61]I don't even care.
[25:59.23]Maybe you're like grounded from electricity or something.
[26:01.59]You wear a lot of rubber?
[26:03.05]Yeah, I mean.
[26:04.11]Oh, look at the, yeah.
[26:04.99]These are pretty rubbery.
[26:06.11]Alright, this one sounds like you though.
[26:07.97]Your negotiating power is high today.
[26:11.16]Ooh.
[26:11.98]So it is time for you to make a great deal for yourself.
[26:17.44]Could I have $100 right now?
[26:19.38]Oh, yeah.
[26:20.70]Look at that.
[26:21.64]Do not ask me for $100.
[26:23.10]Give him $100.
[26:24.00]I'd like $100.
[26:24.36]It's a negotiation power.
[26:26.48]I just got negotiation power.
[26:27.74]Kitty, I need to borrow $100.
[26:29.44]I can't do this again.
[26:30.30]Kitty, give him $100.
[26:31.10]I can't do this again.
[26:32.02]Give him $100.
[26:32.40]I'll pay back.
[26:33.12]Can you write a check?
[26:33.68]Give him $100.
[26:35.98]I'll Venmo you.
[26:36.62]I'll Venmo you $100.
[26:37.06]Alright.
[26:37.98]Hey, look at that negotiator.
[26:39.18]I'm a negotiator.
[26:39.96]Alright.
[26:42.19]Be careful when you are dealing with big personalities right now, is what it says.
[26:45.66]Oh, should I leave this room?
[26:46.62]Are you dealing with anyone with a big personality?
[26:48.74]I feel like I shouldn't be in the studio.
[26:52.68]I should have not showed up today.
[26:54.24]Alright.
[26:55.51]Pay attention to the thoughts and dreams that pop into your head.
[26:57.91]Oh, this is interesting, because you told me earlier, after you have a large dream, you have a headache all day.
[27:03.58]That's right, yeah.
[27:04.60]And you, did you have a large dream last night, or was that Austin's show?
[27:08.32]We both had a bunch of big, weird dreams last night.
[27:10.55]Ooh, spooky.
[27:15.07]Yeah, because, no, two nights ago.
[27:16.93]So I woke up.
[27:18.35]I was walking around.
[27:19.22]And this actually, this is crazy.
[27:20.70]It says right here those dreams could cause you physical discomfort.
[27:23.18]They did.
[27:23.52]They actually did.
[27:24.06]They were like five, like, Slytherin employees that were all standing in my bedroom.
[27:29.70]The bed wasn't there.
[27:30.94]And they were all just standing, staring.
[27:32.50]They were all, like, Slytherin employees.
[27:33.98]And they were all just looking at the wall with, like, long white hair.
[27:37.47]And I was, like, creaking into the room, and it freaked me out.
[27:39.71]So my girlfriend, I was sitting there doing a dog dream, apparently.
[27:43.69]I was sitting there going, like,
[27:50.44]Yeah, it was fucking crazy.
[27:52.08]So and can I swear?
[27:54.28]You can swear.
[27:54.92]Oh, OK, good.
[27:55.48]I'm making sure I can swear on television.
[27:57.74]So she had to wake me up like four times.
[28:00.00]I kept going out and coming out and coming in and coming out and everything.
[28:03.26]I was terrifying.
[28:04.04]Whoa.
[28:04.52]Yeah, and then at one point, I was asleep again.
[28:07.94]And I was across the house.
[28:09.98]And she had woken me up three different times from these Slytherin employees.
[28:13.59]And I was- Now you keep saying employees.
[28:16.79]Yeah.
[28:17.15]Are they students in the house Slytherin?
[28:19.49]No.
[28:19.61]Or are they people who work as like a janitor and a cook within the Slytherin universe?
[28:24.81]These were 100% not students.
[28:25.89]Okay.
[28:26.11]So they graduated and they've become employees somewhere.
[28:30.45]Very possible.
[28:31.21]Alright.
[28:32.38]So they still identify as Slytherins.
[28:33.80]It's like frat boys.
[28:35.16]Yeah.
[28:35.84]Sigma, beta, theta all day long.
[28:37.38]They were all standing like this.
[28:39.44]Very rigid.
[28:40.18]Children of the corn.
[28:41.58]Exactly.
[28:42.18]Alright.
[28:42.76]So eventually, I was in the other room in my dream.
[28:45.92]Because my girlfriend had woke me up three or four times in a row.
[28:49.84]And I'm sitting there going, oh, I'm in the dream again.
[28:53.24]Oh, no, I'm not in the bedroom.
[28:54.32]I won't be able to hear her when she tries to wake me up again.
[28:57.53]Whoa.
[28:58.19]Yeah, it was wild.
[28:59.31]And I woke up with a headache.
[29:00.95]You know, Cutie Cinderella is very good at interpreting dreams.
[29:03.55]What do you think that dream means?
[29:04.49]What does that mean?
[29:05.85]Was there anything besides people?
[29:08.69]No, the bed was missing.
[29:09.95]The bed was missing.
[29:11.03]I have a bed in the bedroom.
[29:12.03]The bed was gone.
[29:12.76]What does it mean, Cutie?
[29:15.00]When you're missing a bed in a dream, it actually means that you feel like you are missing comfort in your life.
[29:21.78]Whoa!
[29:22.32]What's it say on that thing?
[29:23.20]Don't worry about that.
[29:23.94]We're on to this.
[29:25.70]Also, something very interesting.
[29:28.01]September 22nd, I know this, is actually Tom Felton's birthday.
[29:32.85]Who's Tom Felton?
[29:33.55]Tom Felton played Draco Malfoy.
[29:35.61]Whoa!
[29:37.19]in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter.
[29:41.28]It's getting too real in here.
[29:42.47]That's weird.
[29:43.47]Alright, that's weird.
[29:44.19]Why?
[29:44.47]It's getting too real.
[29:45.07]Why were there so many Slytherin employees in my dream?
[29:47.47]He was a Slytherin, and he shares your same birthday.
[29:50.29]And I'm just saying there could be something there.
[29:52.49]Me, Tom Felt.
[29:53.77]Everybody knows him, except for me.
[29:55.97]But missing a bed reveals that you're concerned of not being up to the task and not succeeding.
[30:02.22]Whoa.
[30:03.04]Oh, shoot.
[30:03.70]So maybe.
[30:04.38]Are you having a little imposter syndrome?
[30:06.52]Not, I don't know.
[30:07.78]Am I?
[30:08.36]Maybe you want to be a Slytherin.
[30:09.68]I don't know.
[30:10.02]I'm asking you.
[30:10.96]What does the sun say?
[30:15.24]Good morning.
[30:15.78]Can we ask?
[30:18.14]Good morning.
[30:18.56]We're going to take our next call.
[30:20.28]That was some spooky stuff.
[30:22.66]That was scary.
[30:23.53]Yeah.
[30:23.91]That's weird stuff.
[30:24.63]It's all true.
[30:25.01]Tom Felton.
[30:25.61]Tom Felton's birthday.
[30:26.59]Whoa.
[30:27.17]I was his number one fan.
[30:27.95]I had a poster.
[30:28.53]I would kiss it every day.
[30:29.99]Whoa.
[30:30.27]Should I tweet at him?
[30:31.93]Absolutely.
[30:32.35]I'd be like, hey, dude.
[30:33.19]He doesn't have anything going on anymore.
[30:34.95]Were you in my house last night?
[30:36.49]Were you in my house?
[30:38.71]With a bunch of employees?
[30:39.31]You know, my favorite pickup line I ever got on Tinder, because I had a bio that said something about liking Harry Potter.
[30:46.28]They said, hey, why don't I come slither in bed with you?
[30:49.70]Was this Ludwig?
[30:50.56]Was this how he closed the gap?
[30:51.78]Yeah, Ludwig.
[30:52.88]You can slither on in.
[30:53.88]Alright, we're going to take our next call.
[30:56.58]That got weird.
[30:58.12]This person's been sitting here going, like, can they take my call?
[31:00.48]Like, what are they talking about?
[31:02.26]Hello.
[31:02.54]You got Donna.
[31:03.36]And we're here to help.
[31:05.97]My name is John.
[31:07.93]Tyler, I'm from Missouri.
[31:11.23]Okay, Tyler from Missouri.
[31:14.70]I... For the past few months, I stopped dating because I was using all those dating apps.
[31:22.48]And...
[31:23.91]uh they kind of toxic for me I had a bad look on on dating so I stopped to refresh uh but now I think I'm ready to get back out there uh but I don't really know how to go out enter the dating scene uh without using dating apps because of the pandemic and everything like over the last few years it was just really hard so uh I don't want to use those dating apps
[31:48.65]but I don't really know how to get out there.
[31:51.37]It sounds like, Skylar, it sounds like you had a bad experience on those dating apps.
[31:55.09]Anything happen?
[31:57.98]I went on a lot of dates.
[32:00.04]They were not very good dates, never really amounted to anything, which isn't necessarily bad, but some of them were fairly negative experiences, and I think it just kind of made my outlook on dating
[32:14.77]Uh, not very good.
[32:16.37]Sure.
[32:16.57]So I want to kind of reset and assess my outlook on it.
[32:21.72]So you're asking how to get back into the dating world, huh?
[32:25.50]Yeah, without using, like, dating apps.
[32:28.08]Alright.
[32:28.70]Alright.
[32:29.34]OK.
[32:30.20]Yeah.
[32:30.60]Cutie.
[32:31.02]So what you're going to do is you're at a bar.
[32:35.12]OK.
[32:36.30]And you're going to go up to someone.
[32:37.45]Alright.
[32:38.01]And you're going to say, hey, I'm a seeker.
[32:41.83]Are you my golden snitch?
[32:47.55]What the hell does that mean?
[32:49.65]From Harry Potter.
[32:50.19]It's a callback to it.
[32:51.03]We were just talking about Harry Potter.
[32:53.07]Oh!
[32:53.33]Harry Potter, golden star.
[32:54.79]Oh, oh.
[32:56.68]I thought you were saying he was going to stab her because she's a snitch.
[32:59.30]No, no, no, no.
[32:59.78]He's like, you must be a bludger because you knock me out.
[33:02.16]What the hell is a bludger?
[33:03.14]Well, it's a guy.
[33:03.76]That sounds like a racial slur.
[33:06.41]I hope it's not.
[33:07.11]I hope so, too.
[33:08.29]We'd be off the air pretty fast.
[33:09.75]It would be bad.
[33:10.37]So bad.
[33:12.11]Do you read Harry Potter?
[33:13.03]I've never read this shit.
[33:14.20]You know, I've never read Harry Potter.
[33:16.66]Alright.
[33:17.12]I've only seen the movies.
[33:18.58]OK.
[33:19.04]But I will say, the dating apps are tricky.
[33:22.69]because a lot of times when you scroll through the dating apps I was there years ago and I I'm kind of a slug person and I remember just scrolling through like tinder and hinge and bumble and all these places and it was just everybody was outside like on rocks ah and it's just like I don't I don't want to I don't want to go out on rocks if I like swipe on you that means like oh wow that's cool I can't wait to go like walk around on rocks
[33:47.33]I just don't care.
[33:48.11]Now that you mention it, there are a lot of photos of people on rocks.
[33:50.84]Out on rocks.
[33:51.76]Standing on a rock.
[33:53.24]And with fish.
[33:54.23]Yeah, and holding a fish, too.
[33:56.44]Yeah, it's tricky.
[33:58.12]I wish there was better advice to give, but honestly, I mean, the way that I've met pretty much everybody that I've ever really ever had a relationship with was going out with friends and like friends of friends.
[34:12.19]People knowing that, oh, you're single.
[34:15.05]I'm single too.
[34:16.03]Oh, this person's single, right?
[34:18.15]It's tricky because...
[34:19.91]Those dating apps can just become such crazy places.
[34:23.83]I've seen people just sit there and go like, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe.
[34:27.78]You don't even know who you're doing it to.
[34:29.02]And it's just like, whoa, what's happening here?
[34:32.12]So it's just, I don't like the swipe culture.
[34:34.82]I'm not a big fan of the swipe culture.
[34:36.20]Not a big swiper.
[34:36.96]No, I'm not.
[34:37.42]I'm not a fan of it.
[34:38.88]OK.
[34:39.14]I think people swipe too much.
[34:40.59]Too much swiping.
[34:41.45]It's far too much.
[34:42.41]Far too much swiping.
[34:44.09]I agree.
[34:44.79]I agree with that, too.
[34:46.27]Listen, here's what I'm going to tell you about getting back into the dating world, alright?
[34:50.73]I think it's interesting, right?
[34:52.23]A lot of times people think the best place to go to meet people is a bar or somewhere where people are getting wasted or going out to meet singles.
[35:01.10]I would say for someone like yourself, who sounds like they're a little kind of insecure about getting back into the dating world, I would tell you to go do stuff you like.
[35:09.59]right and try and meet people there right because if you're doing something you're interested in you're going to be passionate about it you got to find someone with the same passion and you can immediately start up a conversation right because at a bar you got to kind of break that barrier of like hey I'm talking to you because I want a bone you know that's a weird place to start from
[35:30.63]It's hard to start up a conversation from, hey, let me give you some poison that will inebriate you, and maybe we can make a mistake later together.
[35:38.21]I think you've got to dial it back.
[35:40.05]Go do something you like.
[35:41.07]What's something you like?
[35:41.71]What's one of your passions, Skylar?
[35:44.91]Movies.
[35:46.19]Movies?
[35:47.57]It's hard to talk to someone in a fucking movie, Skylar.
[35:49.69]Give me another one here, alright?
[35:51.21]Don't be that asshole talking in a movie.
[35:53.57]What's another passion?
[35:54.49]Help me, Skylar.
[35:56.27]That's very, it was very violent.
[35:58.88]What?
[35:59.38]Because that was a loud scream.
[36:00.38]Yeah.
[36:00.74]What?
[36:03.46]Another passion.
[36:04.36]I like, I think like model making is another thing that I really like.
[36:08.86]Oh God, Skyler, you're killing me right now.
[36:11.58]Wait, hold on.
[36:12.09]It's not great.
[36:12.71]What about like volleyball?
[36:13.67]What kind of model making?
[36:16.85]Like ships in a bottle?
[36:21.21]Gun.
[36:21.95]Way worse.
[36:23.21]Way worse?
[36:24.05]It's Warhammer, isn't it?
[36:25.83]It's Warhammer.
[36:26.51]No, it's Gundam.
[36:27.53]Gundam?
[36:28.83]People are into Gundam.
[36:29.85]There's tons of people into Gundam.
[36:31.18]I like Gundam.
[36:31.78]That's a good answer.
[36:32.42]I have a good idea.
[36:32.92]I have a good idea.
[36:33.66]OK, she's got a good idea.
[36:34.84]There is this YouTuber that I know that, well, I don't know him.
[36:39.15]I'm just a fan.
[36:40.37]him and Tom Felton.
[36:41.87]It's called Stuts in Studio, and he makes little models on YouTube, and he has a Patreon.
[36:46.93]You join his Patreon, you join his Discord, you meet someone in the Discord, and you fall in love, and you get on calls, and you say, this is my Discord kitten.
[36:54.29]And every girl, they love being called a Discord kitten.
[36:57.43]That is a great idea.
[37:00.31]Don't use a dating app.
[37:02.24]Turn another app into a dating app.
[37:04.86]A secondary app.
[37:06.04]Yes!
[37:07.12]This is a great idea.
[37:08.16]Cutie Cinderella completely redeemed herself.
[37:09.36]And you would have a commonality of liking, maybe, I don't even know if Stetson Studio hasn't.
[37:14.66]Listen, there are also model stores.
[37:16.42]There are also some other places.
[37:17.72]I'm sure you have some other interests that don't involve you being silent in your own house.
[37:22.77]You know, maybe go explore some of those, but I wish you the best, my friend.
[37:26.83]Also, can we turn the music down?
[37:28.33]Yeah, the music is booming.
[37:29.77]I'm so sick of that.
[37:30.87]I'm sorry.
[37:31.47]It's too loud.
[37:32.89]It's just like, okay, here's this, we're gonna get, they do it in bars, they do it in restaurants, they do it everywhere.
[37:37.27]Yeah, we really Jack it up.
[37:39.27]You just can't even talk.
[37:40.31]You do the thing where you vacuum cleaner talk over people.
[37:43.41]Oh yeah, so blah, blah, blah, blah.
[37:44.91]In their ear, it's turn the music down.
[37:46.94]And at Buffalo Wild Wings, so loud.
[37:49.12]Just turn it down by like 50%.
[37:51.30]I'm also screaming.
[37:52.56]It's fine.
[37:53.76]I also scream a lot, I'm sorry.
[37:55.32]Oh, he said at bars.
[37:56.36]Oh no, I'm talking about like a bar.
[37:58.66]Oh, Skylar's still on the line.
[37:59.78]Sorry, Skylar, good luck, buddy.
[38:04.62]Are you mad at Skylar?
[38:05.80]No!
[38:06.98]He's gonna do fine.
[38:08.04]I mean, Gundam models, that's actually- He's gonna build a heavy arms Gundam at Love and Thunder, and some woman is just gonna rush into his arms.
[38:15.89]He could always just start streaming and fall in love with one of his mods.
[38:19.17]Oh, that's terrible advice.
[38:19.87]I bet you there's a ton of people out there that, like the Gundam scene, that's not, there's nothing wrong with that.
[38:25.10]That was an interesting movie.
[38:26.18]I would be willing to bet that it's overwhelmingly male.
[38:32.34]Maybe.
[38:33.60]Wild guess.
[38:34.78]Do we have time for one more call before break?
[38:37.71]Alright.
[38:38.27]No, we're not going to do that.
[38:38.99]We're going to go to break.
[38:39.83]But you got to stick around because we're giving out advice.
[38:42.63]We'll help you better than we did Skylar, we promise.
[38:45.13]And free t-shirts.
[38:46.39]What?
[38:47.27]We don't have the budget for that.
[38:48.31]Go there.
[38:48.73]Go there.
[38:49.12]Go there.
[38:49.72]Jack, can I get one?
[38:50.74]No.
[38:51.16]There's no t-shirts.
[38:52.54]Oh, okay.
[38:54.22]I feel like I would like one.
[41:23.51]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, you're back here with me, Donna.
[41:27.85]Hey, Donna is the name of this show.
[41:29.85]And man, oh man, have we been giving out some advice.
[41:33.49]We've been giving out advice.
[41:34.59]It's not great.
[41:35.89]It's not our best, but it's advice.
[41:37.80]Alright, it's there.
[41:38.72]Alright.
[41:39.54]Listen, first thing we're going to talk about, if you want to be a caller on the show, which I know you do, we got a new website.
[41:46.84]Here, let's pull that up.
[41:47.96]Let's show them.
[41:48.72]Oh, no, that's the number.
[41:50.46]Wait, that's the website.
[41:52.38]833heydonna.com.
[41:53.18]It's the same as the number.
[41:55.71]Why did we put an 833 in front of it again?
[41:57.91]Who is this other Donna?
[42:01.12]And why is she stealing all my stuff?
[42:03.94]Anyway, you've got to get on the website if you want to be a caller.
[42:07.94]You've got to use the website.
[42:09.56]The phone number is mostly for voicemails.
[42:12.06]We take those two.
[42:12.96]But if you want to be a live caller in the show, putting out your name, getting your problem solved, you've got to get on that website right there.
[42:20.68]It's in the chat.
[42:21.84]Click it.
[42:22.80]Do what it tells you to do.
[42:24.02]Alright.
[42:24.44]We're back on the show.
[42:25.24]How are you feeling, Jeremiah?
[42:26.10]How do you feel about the show?
[42:27.16]I feel great.
[42:28.44]Ready to dole some more advice.
[42:30.12]Now, you've done two shows today.
[42:31.90]Yeah.
[42:32.32]What's the better show?
[42:36.20]Don't think too much.
[42:38.09]Go ahead and just answer.
[42:39.15]Off the top of your head.
[42:40.33]Something like that.
[42:42.61]I think that answers the question pretty well.
[42:46.49]Alright, Cutie, how are you feeling about the show?
[42:51.38]I feel good.
[42:52.06]And what's your favorite show?
[42:55.41]I love Gossip Girl.
[42:56.22]You too, you bitch.
[42:58.02]Say, hey, Donna.
[42:58.96]Someone say, hey, Donna, is their favorite show.
[43:00.62]Hey, Donna is the program that you should be watching at this very moment right now.
[43:04.14]Thank you.
[43:04.89]There you go.
[43:05.39]There you go.
[43:06.99]And now your turn.
[43:07.55]Gossip Girl.
[43:08.19]Your favorite show is?
[43:09.75]Gossip Girl.
[43:12.61]Gossip Girl.
[43:13.48]Have you watched it?
[43:14.00]It be old people.
[43:15.52]Was it on?
[43:17.01]Uh, Netflix.
[43:18.39]It's old.
[43:19.03]It's old, old, like.
[43:20.61]Wait, like it's in a Netflix original series?
[43:22.83]No, no.
[43:24.15]It's like, it used to be on CBS when I was in high school.
[43:28.69]Yeah.
[43:29.67]Didn't the gossip girl turn out to be a man?
[43:31.81]Yep.
[43:32.19]There you go.
[43:32.61]I spoiled it for all of you.
[43:33.65]Watch my show, not that show.
[43:37.11]That's what you get.
[43:37.85]What's your favorite movie of all time, Donald?
[43:39.83]My favorite movie of all time?
[43:51.45]I'm a big fan of Titanic.
[43:53.71]Oh, okay.
[43:54.31]Makes sense.
[43:55.35]Yeah, I get mad at the end, though, because I'm more petite than she was, so I would've put Jack on the table with me.
[44:00.93]That's right.
[44:02.09]A slim girl like me, he would've lived.
[44:04.82]He wouldn't have wanted to.
[44:05.48]Don't say anything!
[44:07.18]Don't you say it!
[44:07.86]I see your eyes!
[44:09.58]He would've lived.
[44:12.06]Right?
[44:12.60]Plenty of room on that door.
[44:14.22]Plenty of room on that door.
[44:15.32]That's right.
[44:15.80]I've never even seen that movie.
[44:17.20]You've never even seen Titanic.
[44:18.26]No, because I know the whole movie.
[44:20.51]What do you mean you know the whole movie?
[44:21.69]I know the whole entire movie.
[44:23.13]You know a ship sank?
[44:24.49]What else do you know?
[44:25.35]I know everything.
[44:25.97]I don't need to see it.
[44:26.61]Tell me one thing that happened.
[44:27.75]Okay, they play music while the ship's coming down.
[44:29.57]Oh, they play music.
[44:30.83]And one goes, gentlemen, it's my pleasure to play music with you.
[44:33.24]No movie ever have they ever played music.
[44:35.22]Hold the phone.
[44:35.82]With a ship.
[44:37.86]But I, yeah.
[44:38.52]Don't help him.
[44:40.30]I feel like I've seen the movie a thousand times.
[44:41.84]Give me another thing that happened.
[44:43.36]Okay, this thing, the T-pose.
[44:46.37]Alright, that's one thing, you're right.
[44:47.73]Romantic.
[44:48.75]You're missing the magic.
[44:51.21]Do I really need to see it?
[44:54.27]What's your favorite movie?
[44:55.65]My favorite movie of all time?
[44:57.55]Gremlins 2.
[44:59.15]What a choice.
[44:59.93]Gremlins 2.
[45:00.61]Gremlins 2, the new batch.
[45:02.00]Favorite movie of all time.
[45:03.06]Gremlins always remind me of Donna when she doesn't shave.
[45:05.84]Oh, okay.
[45:07.06]Yeah, it reminds me too, because you're always getting fed after midnight.
[45:10.88]Listen.
[45:14.93]It's a great film.
[45:16.13]Is it?
[45:16.61]Yeah.
[45:17.19]The best part of that entire movie is, OK, not spoilers for everybody that's not seen Gremlins 2, which, by the way, go see it.
[45:23.03]Go watch it literally right now.
[45:24.27]Right.
[45:24.73]Well, after this show.
[45:25.61]After this show.
[45:26.59]It is one of the first movies to feature interspecies erotica.
[45:31.24]A man has sex with a gremlin.
[45:33.04]Oh, my god.
[45:33.66]Is that why you enjoy it?
[45:34.52]That's accurate.
[45:35.62]Well, that's not accurate why.
[45:36.74]I like it.
[45:37.50]Oh.
[45:37.66]There's a part in the movie where the movie stops.
[45:40.64]Yeah.
[45:41.10]And it goes to inside of a movie theater watching Gremlins 2.
[45:45.28]And the gremlins have ruined the movie in the projector room.
[45:48.54]Right.
[45:48.90]Yeah.
[45:49.26]Yup.
[45:49.86]And they get Hulk Hogan is in his wrestling outfit in the theater.
[45:54.65]Alright.
[45:55.11]And one of the ushers comes over to Hulk Hogan.
[45:57.37]He's like, Hulk Hogan, I'm sorry to bother you while you're watching Gremlins 2.
[46:00.41]But you've got to deal with these gremlins back here in the projector room.
[46:03.31]And he looks into the camera.
[46:04.03]He's like, let me tell you something.
[46:05.41]You gremlins are ruining this movie.
[46:06.76]He goes on a whole routine, like a wrestling promo.
[46:08.58]It's the best part of the whole movie.
[46:10.40]Wow.
[46:10.60]Hey, I don't know if you know this.
[46:12.20]This is not an ad.
[46:15.22]Gizmo's being added to multiverses today.
[46:19.05]That's a good one.
[46:20.55]I love me some Gremlins.
[46:22.31]Do you like Gremlins?
[46:24.41]Gremlins 2 is way better than Gremlins 1, and I will- Now you're talking shit.
[46:27.50]I will fight anyone that's- Now you're talking shit.
[46:30.26]Gremlins 1 was a kind of drama thriller.
[46:34.02]Gremlins 2 is a funny comedy.
[46:36.20]It's a comedy movie.
[46:37.88]We're gonna say an ex-caller, because I don't even know what to say to you.
[46:40.10]Ask him what they think about Gremlins 2.
[46:41.50]Hello, this is Donna.
[46:43.54]Gremlins 1 better than Gremlins 2, do you agree?
[46:46.29]Hey, Donna.
[46:52.13]Hey, how you doing?
[46:53.07]Who is this?
[46:54.75]I'm Jaden.
[46:55.51]I'm from Ventura County, California.
[46:58.46]Jaden, how you doing?
[46:59.80]Jaden Smith.
[47:00.90]I'm good.
[47:01.48]How about you?
[47:02.52]I'm doing really well.
[47:05.49]I have a question.
[47:06.98]You have a question?
[47:07.74]Well, you came to the right place.
[47:11.28]I am a professional artist who does content creation.
[47:15.26]I blend clips showing my personality with art clips such as time lapses.
[47:20.84]Alright.
[47:21.26]Something I found to be highly discouraging to deal with is the lack of return in relation to the amount of work I put in.
[47:27.70]So like on average, the center point is my art, which roughly takes about 46 plus hours to make the entire video.
[47:36.71]Sure.
[47:38.13]My question is, as a content creator, how have you found to be the best way to deal with a specific type of discouragement?
[47:46.75]So you're putting in more work than you feel like the art is getting recognition?
[47:54.07]Yeah.
[47:54.79]Alright.
[47:56.45]Cutie, you don't get enough recognition at all.
[47:59.40]You put in a ton of work.
[48:00.54]You never are where you should be.
[48:02.14]You haven't figured out how to break that glass ceiling.
[48:04.24]Tell them what you've done to deal with disappointment.
[48:08.72]I've just accepted that maybe I'll never break the glass ceiling, so I'll just clean it.
[48:14.80]I'll just sit on the cusp and just shine it for someone else.
[48:18.12]Sometimes not all of us are meant to live our dreams.
[48:25.23]That was, that got really real there for a second.
[48:28.39]Hey, Jerma, you're someone who's wildly successful.
[48:31.32]Could you put yourself in the mind of someone like Judy Cinderella and tell her?
[48:35.04]I'm gonna put a little bit more of a positive spin on this one.
[48:37.12]Yeah.
[48:38.22]So, whenever you make anything,
[48:40.77]You always want to make sure.
[48:41.83]Forget about trying to be recognized or relevant, whatever.
[48:46.27]Your goal should be to always try to make the best thing that you possibly can make.
[48:50.19]And then eventually, right?
[48:51.78]Eventually, if you ever do break that ceiling, if you ever do get out there and some of your work gets shown, and you have, oh, wait, I actually have some relevancy or some people or whatever around.
[49:00.62]And the effort and the time to what you get back is there.
[49:05.05]You have a portfolio of stuff.
[49:07.43]You have a bunch of stuff that's there too that you already did that people will go back and watch and consume and be like, wow, this is great.
[49:17.17]This is so awesome.
[49:17.61]There's a whole catalog of stuff here.
[49:19.73]You can't go into it with expecting to get any relevancy or anything back.
[49:23.81]Just always try to have a good portfolio.
[49:26.15]So if it ever does happen, everything is good and everything has your effort in it.
[49:31.72]Damn, that's good advice.
[49:33.54]Listen, let me first say, Cutie is an amazing creator.
[49:37.13]I'm busting her balls, but everything she does is incredible.
[49:41.18]And beyond that, let me just say, we live in a weird era.
[49:44.06]We live in a weird era where art is quantified and it's measured by how many people put eyes on it, not how good it is, right?
[49:55.01]Some of the best things I've ever seen only have a few views, but we immediately equate the number of eyes on something with how good it is, which is the farthest thing from the truth, right?
[50:05.45]You know how many people watched Morbius?
[50:07.90]That movie sucked, right?
[50:10.88]That doesn't mean it's good just because people were morbing out on a fucking meme.
[50:15.42]Alright.
[50:16.70]But that's that's the era we live in.
[50:18.73]Right.
[50:18.91]We live in the social media era where everyone equates.
[50:22.51]Oh, there's a lot of eyes on this.
[50:24.05]So it must be wonderful.
[50:25.31]It must be the new thing.
[50:27.27]It's gonna be hard to balance your art with exposure, right?
[50:31.99]Because the key to succeeding as a social media creator right now is volume.
[50:37.48]The spice must flow.
[50:39.14]You just make a bunch of crap and at least something's gonna hit, right?
[50:43.44]So as someone doing what you're doing where it takes an enormous amount of work to produce what you're producing, you don't get that same kind of return on it.
[50:53.94]What I would say is this though,
[50:55.83]You can repurpose your art, right?
[50:58.31]Take your art and put it everywhere.
[51:00.03]If you don't have your art on TikTok and on YouTube and on Instagram and hell, put it on Facebook, even though I think only, you know, people in homes are on Facebook anymore.
[51:09.95]Put it everywhere.
[51:10.83]Repurpose it as many times as you can.
[51:13.17]That way you can get the maximum volume out of your art.
[51:16.11]The spice must flow.
[51:17.12]But again, don't ever equate views with the quality of what you're making.
[51:23.47]Yeah, and also, when you're paying attention to what other people are doing, I know it's incredibly difficult.
[51:29.13]It really is.
[51:30.33]To look at other people's success and other people doing well, doing great in your same genre, your same field, it's so hard to block out that noise of, you're doing so well, and I want to do that too.
[51:42.80]I want to do it so bad.
[51:44.42]Use that as firepower.
[51:45.52]Use that for yourself.
[51:46.52]Yeah.
[51:46.80]To want to make stuff that's always good, that's always worth putting your name on.
[51:49.92]Right.
[51:50.74]It's so hard, though, to look at everything and be like,
[51:54.10]you have so many people watching you or so many people watching your art or consuming your art.
[51:57.47]Now I want it so bad.
[51:59.33]Use it.
[51:59.99]Use that as firepower for yourself.
[52:01.15]Yeah.
[52:02.23]I don't know, like, sorry.
[52:04.43]I don't want to cut off anybody.
[52:05.65]I just like, I'll look at TikTok and I'll see some of the dumbest things I've ever thought possible.
[52:16.56]Right.
[52:18.24]But there are a lot of different audiences.
[52:19.70]Right.
[52:21.69]But there are a lot of different audiences, right?
[52:22.99]The audience that you might, when you think about those TikTok videos that you're watching and thinking about, that's a completely different audience that might be even in the same genre of the content that you're making.
[52:32.14]Yeah.
[52:32.92]So it's different worlds that they might not even be connected at all.
[52:38.20]So that's the tricky part, is trying to not look at this other genre, this other group of people making content that may not ever care about your genre, what you're doing.
[52:48.41]Yeah.
[52:49.45]Yeah, I would just say this.
[52:51.81]TikTok is so base, right?
[52:53.93]It's hard to execute high art in like 10 seconds.
[52:57.44]It really is.
[52:58.64]So, you know, if your goal is a bunch of views, then dumb it down, right?
[53:04.02]Even Jay-Z had to bring down his lyrics before he really hit it.
[53:08.22]So, you know, if your goal is mass exposure, just hit yourself in the head a little bit.
[53:13.60]Make your shit a little dumber, right?
[53:15.31]Make it a little quicker, make it a little dumber.
[53:17.75]But if your goal is being a high artist and making great art, don't worry about the views.
[53:21.91]Anyway, you've had enough time.
[53:23.37]You got to go work on your art.
[53:24.49]Get out of here.
[53:24.99]Goodbye.
[53:28.95]We helped that person.
[53:30.57]I think, I believe so.
[53:31.73]I believe so.
[53:32.45]I think so.
[53:33.53]I did.
[53:33.85]I think so.
[53:34.67]We got time for one more call before ads?
[53:39.93]We got time for one more, though?
[53:42.66]Let's do one more.
[53:43.28]Let's get one more in here.
[53:44.94]Oh, there it is.
[53:46.10]Hello.
[53:47.04]You got, hey, Donna.
[53:48.07]I'm giving out some good advice.
[53:51.53]Hi, Donna.
[53:52.65]My name's Jennifer.
[53:54.03]I'm 26.
[53:54.57]Hi, Jennifer.
[53:56.64]Jennifer.
[53:57.46]Hey.
[53:58.56]From the ATL.
[54:02.09]My question is, my last relationships have ended kind of the same way and not of my own volition.
[54:09.97]It always feels like the guys just give up on me and start talking to someone else.
[54:14.88]Jesus Christ, Jennifer.
[54:17.95]Yeah, it's happened a few times now, and it's just getting to the point where I'm not sure if I'm going to open myself up for another relationship because if I'm putting all this emotional energy into these guys, they just don't even care.
[54:31.60]So you're telling me how long you've been dating these guys before they just start talking to someone else?
[54:37.41]The last one I dated for 10 months, and he had just met my mother.
[54:41.67]Oh, my.
[54:43.03]And then he just started talking to someone else?
[54:46.48]Yeah, I found out two months later when I called him out and he admitted he had started a relationship with someone else.
[54:51.39]No!
[54:51.89]How did you find out?
[54:54.49]They were flirting on Twitter.
[54:56.09]No!
[54:57.19]Right out there in the open?
[54:58.51]Hate when that happens.
[54:59.77]He was using the same lines on her that he was using on me.
[55:02.89]No!
[55:03.72]What?
[55:04.12]What lines?
[55:07.60]He was joking that his fitness app doesn't track sex.
[55:11.97]Oh my God, in heaven, Jennifer.
[55:13.69]So I knew that something was going on.
[55:16.39]Jennifer, can I ask a question?
[55:17.73]Do you have like a type in men?
[55:18.99]Do you like bad boys?
[55:20.08]Do you like assholes?
[55:21.08]Is that what's going on?
[55:21.92]Or is this like... I didn't think I liked douchebags, but it does seem that way.
[55:27.54]I mean, listen, let me just say, if he's using a fitness app lying on you, he's a douchebag, alright?
[55:34.95]I'm sorry.
[55:35.65]I'm sorry.
[55:37.01]When did he use that line on you?
[55:38.47]Did it work?
[55:41.04]I mean, yes, but it was the pandemic.
[55:43.06]It was a weird time to be gay.
[55:44.36]Oh, yeah, beggars couldn't be choosers during the pandemic.
[55:48.09]I was looking for any old scratching post when I was locked inside.
[55:51.61]Anybody who passed the PCR was good enough for me.
[55:55.97]Listen, how many times has this happened, Jennifer?
[56:00.77]Like three or four now.
[56:02.25]Three or four?
[56:02.73]Do you... Okay, here's what I'm going to say.
[56:06.45]This must be a type of guy that you're attracted to.
[56:10.94]I don't know what to say.
[56:14.14]I don't know.
[56:15.94]Where are you meeting these guys?
[56:17.05]Yeah, where are you meeting these guys?
[56:19.91]Through friends or like through work.
[56:22.27]They're not like direct coworkers, but they're like
[56:25.46]friends or co-workers or something.
[56:26.86]Was it a timeline too?
[56:28.10]Three, four in timeline?
[56:30.48]No, over many years.
[56:32.18]That's the thing.
[56:33.60]It happens and then I don't feel comfortable dating again.
[56:37.19]And so I take some time for myself and I try again and it just keeps happening.
[56:42.61]Have you thought of going to more Gundam conventions?
[56:45.71]Yeah.
[56:46.89]We got a guy building Gundam models who would be happy to meet you.
[56:49.73]What do you think about them?
[56:51.67]Yeah, are you single?
[56:53.27]Yeah.
[56:53.57]Big time, trust me.
[56:54.50]Yeah.
[56:54.90]Do you like movies?
[56:58.16]I mean, I like movies.
[56:59.44]I don't know what fandoms are, though.
[57:00.98]Well, that's perfect.
[57:02.48]How much time do you have?
[57:03.68]Jennifer, let me start with this, alright?
[57:08.73]It's okay that you don't feel comfortable putting yourself back out there because obviously when someone does this, it's such a violation of trust, right?
[57:18.15]To end the relationship like that, it's so slimy, right?
[57:22.51]If you're out of a relationship, just tell someone.
[57:24.59]The fact that they're prematurely moving on, this is awful.
[57:28.91]And I don't know if you've just had a horrible run of bad luck or if you are just attracted to the worst men on the planet, but
[57:39.29]it's not your fault and I think you know give yourself some time to heal because if you if you put yourself back out there before you are ready you might end up with another piece of shit who's using fitness tracking lines on Twitter these awful yeah you got to make sure that you have you are fully healed you fully recovered and the dating world is going to be there and
[58:04.02]But I think a lot of people put this pressure out on themselves.
[58:06.42]Oh, I got to get right back out there to win the breakup or to make sure that I'm still X, Y, and Z and that blah, blah, blah, blah.
[58:13.23]Give yourself time, my dear, because you're not going to find a quality partner until you are healed from this situation.
[58:21.04]the faster you put yourself out there and if you haven't healed, you might find yourself in a bad situation because you're forcing yourself to find love or to find passion or to find a relationship where there isn't that connection and that might lead to someone losing interest, right?
[58:39.17]If you base a relationship off of immediate passion or a hookup, it doesn't have the longevity to make it a long way.
[58:47.57]So what I think is the pattern that you've established
[58:50.71]is you're putting yourself back into the dating world before you should be, and that leads to dating inferior quality men, and you base this relationship on trysts, and so it doesn't have the staying power.
[59:04.66]I think that is the issue.
[59:06.14]Not you, but just the fact that you're not ready to be back in the dating world.
[59:09.80]Jerma, do you have anything to say?
[59:11.84]That was sage-level advice.
[59:13.84]Oh, thank you.
[59:14.36]That was fantastic.
[59:15.60]Say Donna.
[59:16.60]Yeah, that was some absolute sage-level advice.
[59:18.85]I don't even know if I could add to that.
[59:20.75]That was perfectly said.
[59:22.57]Jennifer, are you feeling a little better, my dear?
[59:25.63]I am.
[59:26.39]I think I needed to be told that it wasn't me.
[59:29.18]Good.
[59:29.76]So here's what you're going to do.
[59:30.86]You're not going to worry about your dating life.
[59:32.68]You're going to go out there and eat, pray, love it.
[59:34.56]Alright?
[59:35.46]You're going to spend some you time.
[59:37.48]And when you feel like you got your groove back, that's when you go look for some new dong.
[59:42.54]Alright?
[59:43.38]And they have to look for, they should use Harry Potter pickup lines.
[59:47.39]No, that's a red flag right there.
[59:49.95]Slytherin employees.
[59:50.99]No, not Slytherin employees either, alright?
[59:53.81]Just look for a good quality guy that can hold a goddamn conversation.
[59:59.31]No more workout app pickup lines.
[60:02.15]That's awful.
[60:02.77]That's the biggest red flag I've ever heard.
[60:04.40]Harry Potter ones.
[60:05.38]That's like cutting leather or herding animals when they were teens.
[60:09.10]That's bad stuff, alright?
[60:10.50]Alright, Jennifer.
[60:11.70]It's okay.
[60:12.60]Good luck.
[60:13.28]Talk to you later.
[60:16.38]Holy smokes.
[60:17.50]Alright, we're going to go to our next ad, but make sure you stick around.
[60:20.63]We're helping more people when we come back with Hey Donna.
[60:23.83]You get more me, you get more cutie, and you get more Gemma.
[60:26.31]Alright, stick around.
[62:45.30]Alright!
[62:46.38]We're back!
[62:49.54]Oh, it's so good to be back.
[62:51.21]Guys, what a wonderful show we've had already.
[62:53.17]But we are now going to play one of our new games with our guest, Jerma.
[62:58.33]Cutie Cinderella, what's the game?
[63:00.52]Hey, guys.
[63:01.42]Welcome over to what we like to call Cutie Time.
[63:04.62]Yay!
[63:05.42]Cutie Time!
[63:06.82]Otherwise known as QT.
[63:09.22]Get it?
[63:11.29]Cutie time.
[63:12.21]I don't get it.
[63:14.59]What do you mean?
[63:15.43]Cutie time.
[63:17.05]Cutie.
[63:19.04]Cutie time.
[63:21.06]Yes!
[63:22.86]I understood it.
[63:23.60]I understand it.
[63:24.22]What the hell is she talking about?
[63:25.80]You having a stroke?
[63:26.80]Letters.
[63:27.28]It's just letters.
[63:28.92]Like quality time?
[63:30.20]Cutie time.
[63:31.64]Yeah.
[63:32.49]Oh.
[63:34.19]Anyway, today we're playing a game that I put together called...
[63:39.36]Who's this tweet about?
[63:41.40]Oh!
[63:41.94]Who's this tweet about?
[63:42.96]Who's this tweet about?
[63:43.92]Is it a reply to Jerma985?
[63:48.31]Alright.
[63:48.95]Or is it a reply to supergalactic porn star Mia Malkova?
[63:54.01]Oh, so we have to guess whether this tweet was made at you or at the amazing porn star Mia Malkova.
[64:00.06]I feel like this is going to be hard.
[64:02.33]Oh, it's gonna be hot alright.
[64:04.13]Whoa, easy.
[64:06.45]Hey now.
[64:07.85]I'll bring up the first one for us to guess about.
[64:11.76]We will not use names, but this was someone, it was Donna.
[64:15.74]Donna said, on May 28th, 2020, that fat, juicy ass
[64:22.37]Now, Jerma, do you have a fat, juicy ass?
[64:25.37]I mean, it's, yeah.
[64:27.30]Because Mia has what we call, from a medical perspective, a very fat, juicy ass.
[64:34.26]And in Texas, we call it a badonkadonk.
[64:36.64]Yes, that's right.
[64:38.31]I ate a lot of McDonald's and hamburgers and shit when I was younger.
[64:41.87]And I think it just, it all went somewhere.
[64:43.65]It went somewhere very rare.
[64:44.45]It went to that ass.
[64:45.31]Yeah, it did.
[64:46.37]Alright.
[64:46.71]It's funny, because I have, like, this little chest.
[64:48.75]And I got my arms are OK.
[64:49.93]But I mean, it's, I have a fairly.
[64:52.61]You got a grown man's butt.
[64:53.81]It's very grown.
[64:55.03]And it's OK.
[64:56.21]It's alright.
[64:56.59]It's OK.
[64:56.75]I'm OK that I have a big, big butt.
[64:57.79]So is this tweet about you or me and Malkova?
[65:00.86]When was it, 2020?
[65:02.28]2020, that fat, juicy ass.
[65:04.34]Fat spelled with a PH.
[65:05.94]PH.
[65:08.44]Which is the good.
[65:09.92]Yeah.
[65:11.16]I'm going to say 2020.
[65:12.12]I'm going to say this is about me.
[65:15.95]Wow.
[65:16.89]Alright.
[65:17.34]What do you think, Donna?
[65:19.93]Am I missing something?
[65:21.57]I'm missing Mia Malkova.
[65:24.35]I mean, she's famous for that dumper.
[65:26.36]That's really rude to your guest that you're saying.
[65:28.90]I'm sorry.
[65:29.98]Well, I don't have a world famous dumper.
[65:32.96]No, you don't.
[65:35.81]It's a man's ass, whatever.
[65:37.29]Yeah, it's a man's ass.
[65:38.25]It's normal.
[65:41.67]I would like to say Jerma is a little full of himself.
[65:46.61]It is Mia Malkova.
[65:49.39]I mean, that's all.
[65:50.09]I wanted that tweet of me showing my ass in the mirror.
[65:54.91]What?
[65:55.85]That tweet of me with my ass in the mirror was what, 2020, right?
[65:57.87]You're showing ass?
[66:00.40]You're a man of many talents.
[66:02.20]You got a dollhouse?
[66:03.14]You showing ass?
[66:04.50]And he was in Guys and Dolls.
[66:05.60]He was in Guys and Dolls.
[66:06.62]Sing the song.
[66:08.44]Thanksgiving 2020.
[66:08.88]Thanksgiving 2020, I did a big turkey ass thing.
[66:11.16]I had a big turkey food ass thing.
[66:13.24]Can you pull it up somehow?
[66:15.70]No, we can't do that.
[66:16.86]I don't have that.
[66:18.60]I don't have that skill.
[66:19.72]I thought that was 2020.
[66:20.30]Whatever.
[66:20.78]Moving on.
[66:21.84]You'll be good.
[66:22.54]OK.
[66:23.28]Next.
[66:23.76]Next tweet from someone.
[66:27.78]Says, I wonder if someone has ever shaved their balls to your stream.
[66:33.58]Wow.
[66:33.98]August 29th.
[66:35.03]Shave their balls.
[66:36.73]I know I haven't done that myself, but.
[66:38.71]What a tweet.
[66:40.07]Is this a reply to Jemma or me?
[66:44.20]Do you do a lot of personal grooming on your stream?
[66:47.70]I have shaved on stream before.
[66:49.34]You shaved your balls?
[66:50.44]No, not my balls.
[66:51.90]Oh, OK.
[66:52.36]I've shaved my chin and my mustache.
[66:55.42]Alright.
[66:56.56]I don't know.
[66:57.28]I have no idea.
[66:58.54]Is there any reason that anybody would tweet this at you?
[67:00.76]Any rational reason?
[67:02.20]No.
[67:02.26]Do you encourage people to do this while you're streaming?
[67:04.70]No, I don't.
[67:05.38]Are you sponsored by Manscaped?
[67:07.46]I got sponsored by Fansly that time.
[67:09.54]Oh!
[67:09.96]So I mean, come on.
[67:11.28]I don't know if Fansly has a shaving balls category.
[67:13.94]No, they don't.
[67:15.44]I'm gonna, you know what, I said, I got it wrong last time, but I think I'm gonna get it right.
[67:18.40]I think this is, I think this is to me.
[67:20.55]This is to you?
[67:21.13]I think this is to me.
[67:22.99]I believe it's to me.
[67:24.67]I believe this is to you.
[67:26.37]I'm gonna be the contrarian.
[67:28.73]I'm gonna go Mia again.
[67:29.99]Wow, wow, okay.
[67:32.49]Alright, well, this one was in fact for Jerma.
[67:35.69]Whoa!
[67:37.82]Ball shaving icon.
[67:39.94]By the way, the answer is probably yes.
[67:42.78]Oh.
[67:43.92]Has anyone ever done this to my, probably.
[67:45.64]There are people that put my stream in their tabs to do homework and, you know, I don't know, whatever they're gonna do.
[67:52.79]Homework is a little bit different than shaving your wabos.
[67:56.61]Whatever they're doing.
[67:57.89]They might be doing something.
[67:59.09]I know that people put streams on in the background.
[68:01.91]Maybe you're doing some personal grooming.
[68:03.83]They could have your stream on while they're in the shower.
[68:06.61]Or while they're sitting at their desk shaving their balls.
[68:08.79]Alright, it's one-all.
[68:09.82]We're going into the next round.
[68:10.86]This is tiebreaker.
[68:11.66]Next one.
[68:13.44]OK.
[68:14.92]This is a reply from August 26.
[68:16.50]It says, how long until someone does what Ballfondler predicted?
[68:21.44]I mean, I already know.
[68:23.88]How is there someone in your community named Ballfondler?
[68:28.55]My stream looks fucking crazy.
[68:30.99]My stream looks insane from the outside.
[68:33.21]Who is this Ballfondler?
[68:34.59]This is 100% to me.
[68:36.52]Now you are confident.
[68:39.38]So you must know this Ballfondler, gentlemen.
[68:43.08]I would put $1,000 that this is to me.
[68:45.65]Who is the Ballfondler?
[68:46.83]He sounds like the Hamburglar.
[68:50.85]Alright.
[68:51.39]So do I need to explain this, Donna?
[68:52.99]Yeah, absolutely.
[68:54.45]OK.
[68:55.65]So I did this baseball stream where I had the circus versus magicians.
[68:59.47]And when I talked about what it was, there was somebody in the community who months before, somebody asked just a simple question.
[69:06.74]What is the baseball stream?
[69:08.16]What is that?
[69:09.30]Oh, you're doing a baseball stream.
[69:10.74]And this person in the community replied,
[69:13.54]and said, oh, he's, I mean, this is on television, right?
[69:16.82]Is it gonna be airing on television?
[69:17.70]Yeah, it's gonna be on television.
[69:18.56]You're gonna have to bleep literally the entire season.
[69:20.32]Alright, get ready.
[69:21.29]Okay, so here we go.
[69:22.33]Three, two, one.
[69:24.31]It's when he's gonna shove an entire baseball up his ass on camera.
[69:27.47]The whole thing.
[69:28.73]So that's what they said.
[69:29.59]Now, what did Twitch think about when you did that?
[69:32.42]They weren't happy about it.
[69:33.72]Oh, so this happened.
[69:35.66]It didn't happen on camera.
[69:37.30]It didn't happen at all.
[69:38.30]It didn't happen at all.
[69:38.94]Let's get that clear.
[69:39.58]Okay.
[69:40.23]So that man's name was Balfon.
[69:43.64]They got banned permanently because they kept harping on it.
[69:47.60]They kept saying it.
[69:48.48]So this wasn't a one-time prediction.
[69:51.14]No.
[69:51.42]He was really hitting that you were going to suppository a baseball.
[69:55.24]And we're talking suppository a baseball.
[69:57.26]Wow.
[69:58.31]The legend of the Ballfondler.
[69:59.71]Well, I don't even need to guess, Mia Malcoma.
[70:02.19]There's no way this is Tim Neumann.
[70:03.45]As long as Ballfondler isn't your uncle, none of us are concerned.
[70:07.05]I guess he wins this one.
[70:08.83]You win this one.
[70:09.70]This one's a true tweet.
[70:11.68]There's no way.
[70:12.28]That's like, yeah.
[70:13.52]And Ed Finsley!
[70:17.75]I mean.
[70:18.31]They added Fansly also.
[70:20.51]Yeah, because.
[70:21.23]As if they would get Fansly to further leverage you and put pressure on you to put a baseball in your ass.
[70:29.58]Yeah, yeah.
[70:30.64]You know what's, okay, let's go off on a little tangent here.
[70:33.46]Alright.
[70:34.62]A week ago, we talked about financing streams.
[70:38.05]It's like, oh, yeah, yeah, and just, I know you probably can't put this on television.
[70:41.41]So we were talking about, oh, trying to find sponsors and trying to find people that would pay for a show and, oh, it's so hard going back and forth trying to, and somebody said that they would pay $50,000 for a ball that I may have put on my ass.
[70:53.23]And I'm just sitting there going, go back and forth a thousand times with all these sponsors and production teams and,
[70:59.82]Or what, 10 baseballs?
[71:01.46]Yeah, that'd be- Oh, yeah!
[71:02.42]That's it?
[71:03.02]Oh, and you got money for however long?
[71:05.06]Oh my gosh!
[71:06.21]That's ridiculous to think about that.
[71:07.55]It's ridiculous to think about.
[71:08.49]So how many baseballs did you sell?
[71:09.83]Zero.
[71:10.37]No, okay, alright.
[71:11.95]It's mistake number one.
[71:13.61]Next tweet.
[71:15.01]Oh, we have more?
[71:15.89]Oh, shoot.
[71:16.37]Yep, this one says, I've never wanted to be a floorboard more in my life than right now.
[71:23.96]Now, do you have a history with floorboards?
[71:26.28]Have you ever sat on the floor?
[71:29.05]You done anything on the floor we should know about?
[71:30.81]I hope.
[71:31.69]I don't think so.
[71:34.04]On the floor?
[71:34.80]There's no way.
[71:37.04]I show, like, here on camera.
[71:40.20]I usually don't have.
[71:41.92]Couldn't have been anything in the dollhouse?
[71:44.49]Did you do push-ups or anything?
[71:46.19]You know, it actually could be.
[71:48.15]Were you doing push-ups on a floorboard?
[71:51.21]I still don't think so.
[71:51.85]I think this is me.
[71:53.32]Alright, I'm going to be a contrarian.
[71:54.86]I'm going to lock in Jerma.
[71:56.22]Alright.
[71:57.68]Is in fact, Mia Malkova.
[71:59.33]Mia Malkova.
[72:01.35]What was that in relation to?
[72:03.23]What was she doing on the floor?
[72:04.11]Sitting on the floor.
[72:04.99]Oh, wow.
[72:06.33]And who can blame him?
[72:07.57]Who can blame him?
[72:09.73]Alright.
[72:10.50]That's it.
[72:11.50]You won.
[72:12.22]Did I win?
[72:12.58]You win.
[72:13.28]You really know your Twitter.
[72:14.68]Do I get another big check?
[72:16.44]You get a free t-shirt.
[72:17.80]Yeah, you get a t-shirt.

[73:14.25]Go ahead.
[73:15.35]Okay.
[73:17.17]Okay, so my boyfriend likes to grunt like a gorilla during sex.
[73:23.49]Oh, God.
[73:25.85]You came in hot.
[73:27.14]You should have just kept playing telephone tag.
[73:29.14]Holy shit.
[73:30.68]Alright, Ash, so your boyfriend likes to grunt a lot.
[73:34.78]Yes, like, excuse me.
[73:39.78]no ash stop stop what you're doing please do it one more time though one more time alright I'm getting the visual now okay
[73:55.09]Yes, yes.
[73:56.89]Um, and this is not just during sex.
[73:59.33]Oh, no.
[73:59.57]But any chance he can.
[74:02.41]Huh?
[74:02.63]What do you mean, any chance?
[74:03.90]Does he do this when he drinks milk?
[74:05.00]Like, this is, is it, like, during fellatio?
[74:07.18]Or are we, like, talking about, like, when he's washing dishes?
[74:10.54]Yeah.
[74:13.68]No, to be fair, actually, he's washed enough dishes in his time.
[74:16.07]He, uh, had three siblings.
[74:17.87]Oh, okay.
[74:20.41]So, is the question how to get him to stop grunting?
[74:24.32]She just wants to brag.
[74:25.28]This is a flex.
[74:28.19]Ash called the brag.
[74:29.11]Ash, is the question how to get him to stop?
[74:32.45]No, honestly, we've been together for six years now.
[74:39.28]We have a little girl together.
[74:40.98]She's
[74:42.21]five years old okay I was just wanting to know how to like deal with this because some days I see how he grunts and groans and it's just so funny to do and it's so impressive how he does it I mean the way I do it it doesn't even compare honestly I oh god ash I gotta tell you right now
[75:02.22]you broke the number one rule you laugh if a man does something and you laugh it's fair game right if he farts and you laugh there's no way he's gonna stop right so the problem is you keep laughing as long as you laugh he's gonna keep grunting because no matter what you say he gets a laugh out of you it's over that's true when he does this during sex are you turned on or off
[75:31.87]No!
[75:32.17]Ash!
[75:32.87]There's no price!
[75:36.99]There's no advice!
[75:37.81]I just made an epiphany.
[75:39.19]It all makes sense.
[75:40.05]Ash is from Florida.
[75:40.74]What can I say?
[75:41.42]I would like to point that out.
[75:43.54]What's that?
[75:44.60]You are from Florida, Ash?
[75:45.60]Is that true?
[75:45.90]You are from Florida.
[75:47.00]That, yes.
[75:47.72]Yes, indeed.
[75:48.60]But is it, OK, is it the whole time?
[75:55.56]The entire time?
[75:57.24]Only during climax.
[75:59.56]Oh!
[76:04.38]And you very much enjoy this.
[76:06.28]On national TV right now.
[76:08.24]Oh, my God.
[76:09.63]Jesus Christ, Ash.
[76:13.43]I mean, I don't think there's no issue.
[76:16.12]I don't know why you called, Ash.
[76:17.62]I mean, if you enjoy it.
[76:20.38]I think you got a problem if the kid starts doing it, though.
[76:26.97]Oh, honestly, my daughter loves monkeys.
[76:29.55]No!
[76:31.51]Okay, listen, you gotta... She is a daddy's girl for sure.
[76:35.03]Oh, God.
[76:35.57]Alright, alright, so listen.
[76:38.39]Listen, if you wanted to stop, you gotta stop laughing.
[76:43.64]Because that's gonna open up the door, alright?
[76:46.46]That's definitely gonna open up the door.
[76:47.92]It's like, listen, if a man farts around you and you laugh, right, cutie?
[76:54.51]Do you laugh at Ludwig's farts?
[76:56.33]No, he doesn't fart around me.
[76:57.81]That's the boldest-faced lie.
[76:59.93]That's more of a lie than a 6'5".
[77:01.73]He always says, he says, boys don't fart.
[77:04.09]That's what he says.
[77:05.11]They don't poop either.
[77:06.38]He told me that.
[77:06.84]What is he, a fucking Kardashian?
[77:09.04]That's what he says.
[77:13.28]Does he have any habit that makes you laugh, though?
[77:17.42]Yes.
[77:18.04]Alright, what does he do?
[77:21.44]So he looks at me and smiles, and then I just laugh.
[77:26.46]So charming.
[77:27.02]You are the worst.
[77:29.46]Jeremy, do you do anything that?
[77:31.80]Alright, so me and my girlfriend, we don't say that we go to the bathroom.
[77:35.79]We don't.
[77:36.15]We say, oh, I have to disappear.
[77:38.53]Oh!
[77:39.35]No, we're not going to take a shit.
[77:41.25]We're not going to, oh, no, no, no.
[77:42.47]I'm not going to fart somewhere.
[77:44.09]I have to disappear.
[77:45.66]I'm gonna disappear, I'll be back.
[77:46.80]Disappear?
[77:47.80]Wait, why?
[77:50.02]I'll be back in like 20 minutes.
[77:51.64]I got two Kardashians here.
[77:53.59]What is going on?
[77:54.49]Okay, I lied.
[77:55.27]Ludwig shits with the door open.
[77:56.65]What in the world?
[77:58.49]God help me.
[78:00.49]I'm like a cat.
[78:01.35]I'm like a cat.
[78:02.09]I don't want anyone to know that I went to the bathroom.
[78:03.93]I don't want anyone in like a two mile radius to know I went to the bathroom.
[78:06.78]That is insane.
[78:09.24]listen Jerm is the weird one no I mean there's a lot going on right I think I need to give my co-hosts help listen I I don't this is one of the few times you've stumped Donna because I don't know if you even want to stop your current situation I don't know how to help you ash but maybe get him a little shock collar or something I don't know like one of those barking collars
[78:32.32]But hold on, wait, final question.
[78:34.14]But doing sex, it would shock you, too.
[78:36.10]That doesn't work, either.
[78:37.30]But is it, hold on.
[78:38.48]No, that would not.
[78:39.60]Is it just him doing it?
[78:41.87]Is it you, too?
[78:43.17]Do you reply?
[78:47.35]Once or twice.
[78:48.53]Ash, there's no way I can help you.
[78:50.15]I'm sorry.
[78:50.85]There's nothing to help you.
[78:51.87]There's nothing I can do.
[78:53.19]Get Ash out of here.
[78:54.61]You're all acting like animals.
[78:55.85]Alright.
[78:56.77]Thank you for your call.
[78:57.98]We'll talk later.
[79:03.70]She just called the brag!
[79:04.98]Yeah, that was a brag call.
[79:06.54]That was a brag!
[79:08.76]That was a great call.
[79:09.96]That was a wonderful call.
[79:11.08]She was wonderful.
[79:12.04]I like Ash.
[79:13.38]When we come back, I think we got one more round of calls.
[79:16.55]Thank you for your amazing calls thus far.
[79:18.57]If you want a call, go on the website.
[79:20.59]Use the website.
[79:21.59]I can't wait to talk to each and every one of you when we come back.
[79:24.37]More Hey Donna with Jerma and Cutie Cinderella.
[79:27.47]Oh, no.
[79:28.65]Start grunting.
[81:46.88]Alright, everybody.
[81:48.34]You're back with Hey Donna.
[81:49.88]And unfortunately, all good things must come to an end.
[81:53.20]We have one more block with the amazing Jerma and my incredible niece, Cutie Cinderella.
[82:00.69]So we got one more call and some voicemails coming up.
[82:03.87]Voicemails at the end of the show.
[82:05.65]Call coming in right now.
[82:08.85]Hello.
[82:09.61]You got Hey Donna.
[82:12.07]Hello.
[82:12.50]This is Donna.
[82:14.02]Yeah, this is Donna.
[82:16.05]Hi, this is Rachel from Texas.
[82:18.67]Rachel from Texas?
[82:19.75]Yeah.
[82:21.77]How you doing, Rachel from Texas?
[82:24.21]I'm alright.
[82:24.67]How are you?
[82:25.19]Well, I'm doing fantastic.
[82:27.11]I'm on my show.
[82:29.28]Nice, nice.
[82:30.48]Yeah.
[82:32.54]I had a question for you.
[82:35.12]Alright.
[82:35.50]So I...
[82:37.16]quit my job, but they are in desperate need of employment.
[82:42.54]And I don't know if I should help them or not, or if I should just call the health inspector.
[82:47.33]What?
[82:48.01]OK, that last bit was a little loaded.
[82:51.97]Why would you call the health inspector?
[82:56.34]Many reasons.
[82:58.14]The first being that there's bugs in the machines that we're, like, serving food from.
[83:01.79]Oh, my God!
[83:05.01]What restaurant is it?
[83:09.15]It's not a restaurant.
[83:10.29]It's, like, an arcade bar and, like, ice cream place.
[83:15.09]I can't even tell you.
[83:16.63]Oh, God in heaven!
[83:19.35]And they want you to come back and work there.
[83:21.51]Well, like, they need people, and...
[83:25.94]I don't wanna come back until they give me my money.
[83:29.04]But I don't know if they can do that last part without more employment or anything.
[83:35.92]Well, I mean, they can't even get rid of the bugs in their machines.
[83:40.97]So, listen, this is a loaded question.
[83:44.21]I feel more shook up than the grunting from the last call.
[83:48.59]What exactly do you need to know?
[83:50.62]Are you asking if you should extort your former employee?
[83:54.90]No.
[83:55.88]No, I feel bad, and I don't know if I should, like...
[83:59.74]help them find more employees because I feel like they could be a great place.
[84:04.90]Right?
[84:05.30]If they just, like, had more management or something.
[84:08.64]And if they got the possibly harmful pest infestation out of their food?
[84:16.61]Yeah, yeah, that too.
[84:18.49]Alright!
[84:20.41]Have you informed them of these insects or health problems?
[84:25.69]They have to know.
[84:26.67]Like,
[84:28.58]At this point, it's just the manager there, and she's got to know.
[84:32.46]What do you mean she's got to know?
[84:35.09]Is it that bad?
[84:36.05]Are they everywhere?
[84:38.75]They're in, like, the main, like, we sell at Frozen Rose, and they're in that.
[84:45.65]Oh!
[84:46.05]And, like, they're all in the kitchen area.
[84:48.93]It's pretty hard to miss.
[84:51.43]Oh.
[84:52.87]Cutie, you work a lot with food.
[84:55.05]Do you have any?
[84:56.81]I, my, you don't, do you owe these people anything?
[85:00.99]I'm confused why you wouldn't.
[85:02.17]Because if you're balancing, you have two options.
[85:04.93]You call the health code on them and it really sucks for the owners.
[85:08.60]Or you don't call the health code on them and it sucks for every single patron that goes there.
[85:12.94]So you're saving the world if you call the health code on them.
[85:18.00]That's a fair point.
[85:20.31]Listen, Rachel, you're a very young woman and you got stars in your eyes and you're trying to do right by your employer, right?
[85:29.83]You're trying to do right by them by apparently allowing bugs to exist in their food.
[85:36.16]But let me tell you, you're not helping anyone, right?
[85:38.74]If you think this can be a great place, what I would do is give them an ultimatum, right?
[85:43.00]You got to go to your employer and you got to go listen.
[85:45.62]This is fucking disgusting.
[85:47.64]You need to do something, and if you are proactive about fixing this situation, about remedying your noxious work environment, then I will come back and work here.
[85:59.63]If they do not,
[86:01.23]then you should definitely report them because they are poisoning people, right?
[86:05.80]Maybe you will feel better if you give them the option to do something, because it sounds like you've never directly mentioned it, right?
[86:15.52]You said they must know.
[86:17.50]So maybe they don't give them the benefit of the doubt, I guess, but Rachel, this is pretty heinous.
[86:23.85]I mean, bugs in the rosé.
[86:26.33]I mean, has anybody complained?
[86:30.54]No, it's just the employees that know.
[86:33.34]Nobody seems to notice.
[86:36.68]Yeah, that is a health hazard, Rachel.
[86:38.58]I feel like that problem needs to be addressed.
[86:41.31]I think that the bugs in the food is probably priority one.
[86:45.81]Yeah, we're out here in California where restaurants get shut down for having seed oil in them.
[86:50.59]You know what I mean?
[86:51.23]Like, I mean, we're not talking about a vegan cross-contamination issue.
[86:56.21]We're talking about fucking exoskeletons in our liquor.
[87:01.29]Yeah, I wanted to tell the owner.
[87:05.40]He just scares me a lot.
[87:07.94]He scares you?
[87:09.28]Yeah, you don't want to work there if he scares you.
[87:10.98]Why the hell are you working in this?
[87:12.82]Why do you feel like you owe them anything?
[87:16.44]I don't know.
[87:17.10]They owe me some money, and so I kind of want the rest of the money.
[87:22.11]How much?
[87:24.79]Maybe over $60,000.
[87:28.78]$1,000?
[87:28.80]No, just $60.
[87:30.60]Oh, $60.
[87:30.84]They owe me tips in my final paycheck.
[87:35.83]$60,000.
[87:35.85]$60 is not worth you feeling uncomfortable.
[87:38.91]That's not worth it.
[87:39.59]Yeah, when someone gets dengue fever from the cockroaches in your beverage, I guarantee their hospital bill is going to be more than $60.
[87:47.27]Yeah.
[87:49.69]Yeah.
[87:50.57]I just want that money, and I don't know.
[87:53.71]Yeah, I think you probably got to report them.
[87:57.73]Yeah.
[87:58.05]I'm going to tell you, if the bug problem is that bad, maybe tell them, I don't know.
[88:05.22]I don't know what to do.
[88:06.22]You know what, you're 18.
[88:08.30]Talk to my mods.
[88:09.68]Have them give them your Venmo or something.
[88:12.36]I'll pay you the 60 bucks.
[88:13.94]Report them to the health inspector, alright?
[88:17.03]Okay.
[88:17.69]Alright, Rachel, good luck and God bless, and for God's sakes, don't drink any of that rosé.
[88:22.17]Okay.
[88:23.37]I will not.
[88:23.98]Thank you.
[88:25.12]Alright.
[88:25.54]Oh, shit.
[88:28.08]Oh, fuck.
[88:30.39]That one scrambled my brains up.
[88:32.07]That...
[88:34.67]Rosé's supposed to be a classy drink.
[88:37.51]You've done much less for $60.
[88:39.03]Oh, that's, you're right.
[88:40.89]I'm just so glad I make my own egg salad.
[88:43.03]I make my own food.
[88:44.23]You make your own egg salad?
[88:45.35]Yeah, I just, I don't, you know.
[88:46.67]Any bugs in it?
[88:47.83]Absolutely not.
[88:49.19]Absolutely no bugs.
[88:50.57]Zero.
[88:51.09]There's gonna be bugs.
[88:52.67]And if you're scared of your boss, that's never a good sign.
[88:55.09]Well, she's, you know, she's 18.
[88:56.71]She's young.
[88:57.49]I was scared of my boss at 18.
[88:58.59]I was scared of my parents at 18.
[89:04.11]I remember it because it was only a few years ago.
[89:08.83]Alright, we got our voicemails.
[89:09.99]Let's bring them up.
[89:11.51]Hey, Donna.
[89:11.99]My name's Jamie, and I just wanted to find out how you fight imposter syndrome.
[89:17.29]I'm getting my master's in counseling, and I'm about to start counseling people in person.
[89:21.97]And I'm terrified, and I think I'm going to fail.
[89:23.99]So I just want to know about how you got so confident.
[89:27.11]Thanks, Donna.
[89:28.20]Imposter syndrome?
[89:29.62]Either you got any good information on imposter syndrome
[89:33.20]I would say the best thing you can do is you have to believe that you can do something, right?
[89:39.91]Yeah.
[89:40.57]If you cannot convince yourself, you've lost.
[89:45.29]You need to convince yourself first before you convince other people.
[89:48.33]Yeah.
[89:48.59]So you have to believe yourself first.
[89:52.27]And you should believe what you're doing.
[89:53.67]You should believe yourself first.
[89:55.33]It's so much easier to convince other people once you believe yourself.
[89:58.37]Yeah.
[90:00.54]I had to Google it.
[90:02.49]Oh, you don't know what imposter syndrome is?
[90:04.03]I think I might have it.
[90:04.99]Yeah.
[90:06.03]I'm dealing with a lot over here right now.
[90:10.52]I think you make a good point, actually, cutie.
[90:13.38]Ultimately, I think that most people experience imposter syndrome.
[90:18.55]matter how prepared you are no matter how many times you've done what you're doing I think professionally especially everybody experiences imposter syndrome because it's just something we go through right especially in the workplace it's like we build up our our profession so much and we can't believe that anybody would pay us to do what we do and it it becomes this self-defeating
[90:41.38]I personally haven't had imposter syndrome, and you know, even people like Mike Tyson used to get afraid before fights, one of the greatest fighters of all time.
[90:49.16]He used to talk about how he was scared out of his mind.
[90:51.18]I think it's something that just goes with the territory, and it's like Jerma says, you gotta convince yourself.
[90:57.09]You gotta look that dragon right in the face, and you gotta fight it, and you gotta deal with it, and just know, kind of like the imagining everybody naked in a room, just know everybody's going through the same thing.
[91:07.39]Even Cutie Cinderella.
[91:10.00]You got to talk yourself up too, right?
[91:11.88]You have to give yourself the confidence to be able to do anything.
[91:14.52]It doesn't matter if it's, you know, like, oh, screaming or like you mentioned with your work.
[91:20.23]You have to just be able to say, I'm going to do good today.
[91:23.97]I'm going to go for it.
[91:24.71]And I'm going to do it because obviously you're prepared.
[91:27.15]You know what you do.
[91:27.99]You know you're good at what you do.
[91:29.03]So do it.
[91:29.89]Yeah, there you go.
[91:31.07]And don't listen to other people that are, well, hold on, let's talk about this for a second.
[91:34.96]Like, do you know this?
[91:35.66]Do you know that?
[91:36.18]Do you know how to do this?
[91:38.00]You have to listen to yourself, and you have to believe yourself first.
[91:42.22]Then you'll lie to everybody else about how good you are.
[91:46.22]And if you stay the imposter and no one notices, you win the game.
[91:49.80]There you go.
[91:51.82]Just be a little sus.
[91:53.35]Convince yourself first.
[91:55.35]Alright, one more voicemail.
[91:56.49]Let's hear it.
[91:57.93]Hey, Donna, my name is Andrew.
[91:59.51]I'm 36 in Portland, Oregon, and I just got out of the military.
[92:02.97]This is the first time in my life that I've been on my own and someone is not telling me what to do.
[92:08.94]And I honestly don't know what to do.
[92:11.82]I can't find what I want to do in life.
[92:17.92]And to be honest, another reason is without the uniform, I'm missing a lot of confidence these days.
[92:23.95]I don't really know how to get past that.
[92:26.11]Thanks, Donna.
[92:28.49]Well, you need to find yourself someone like Cutie Cinderella.
[92:31.03]Get a girlfriend that just tells you everything to do.
[92:34.67]Donna, your favorite Broadway show tune is On My Own.
[92:39.93]Take it away.
[92:41.93]Oh, my favorite Broadway show.
[92:44.29]On my own.
[92:46.82]I can't wait to be on my own.
[92:49.72]From Les Miserables, yeah.
[92:51.72]Oh, I was doing a different one.
[92:54.24]Yeah, Les Miserables.
[92:56.78]Les Miserables.
[92:57.94]Play miserable.
[92:58.76]When she sings it, yeah.
[93:00.28]No, this is a good call.
[93:02.94]This is a good call.
[93:04.30]That's tough, right?
[93:05.30]When you got someone, it's scary to think for yourself.
[93:08.81]It is.
[93:09.15]It's a lot easier to have someone to tell you what to do.
[93:12.03]You know, I think there's a comfort to that because you just do what you're told to do.
[93:16.29]You don't have to second guess it.
[93:17.75]Okay, I'm blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[93:20.51]That's tough when you've fallen into that behavior for so long.
[93:24.64]What do you guys think?
[93:25.70]How does one get back to being an independent thinker?
[93:28.40]First of all, don't worry about the age thing.
[93:30.12]You mentioned 36, right?
[93:31.32]I'm 37.
[93:31.56]Right.
[93:33.18]And I really did not kind of know to listen to myself and to know what I was going to do, where I was going to be in life, until I was at least 28, 29, at least.
[93:42.82]Yeah.
[93:43.20]So don't let how old you are be able to be like, oh, wow, I'm...
[93:46.97]I'm 36, 37, 38.
[93:48.49]Oh, man, I'm so far behind.
[93:50.49]You're not.
[93:51.57]There's tons of cases of just being able to grow into yourself well into your 20s, well into your 30s.
[93:57.03]So don't worry about that, first of all.
[93:58.69]Yeah.
[94:00.93]The confidence thing without your costume.
[94:06.35]What's it called?
[94:06.93]Uniform.
[94:07.63]Thank you.
[94:08.61]Without your uniform.
[94:09.61]Your military costume, like he's a stripper.
[94:14.01]That's the last time I saw anybody wear a costume like that, so my apologies.
[94:18.91]Uniform, without your uniform, losing confidence.
[94:21.59]You know, that's a tough one.
[94:23.39]I will say, after I quit my corporate job, and I quit it to play video games every day,
[94:29.60]I I lost a lot of confidence because I felt like I was known for being the successful person that was arbitrarily society's definition of success and now I play video games for a living LOL and men want to see my feet uh like a lot and they would pay me a lot of money for it no big deal um but I uh you know I
[94:50.62]It takes a while.
[94:51.58]I've been doing this for a few years and I still don't think I've hit that same level of confidence that I used to have.
[94:56.83]So overall, my advice is to say, be patient with yourself and if you can sell your feet, maybe you should.
[95:02.98]Yeah.
[95:03.94]You know, it's interesting that you say that.
[95:05.94]Wait, what?
[95:06.44]Sell your feet?
[95:07.23]Hm?
[95:07.97]Oh.
[95:08.95]Well, the other part was interesting.
[95:10.27]Well, time limits are, a lot of people say like, oh, I better do this before I'm 40.
[95:14.99]I better be who I want to be before I'm 30.
[95:18.20]You can't put a time limit on what you're going to do with yourself.
[95:20.68]Yes.
[95:21.48]It's impossible.
[95:22.24]That is good advice.
[95:23.88]I would say as far as the outfit is concerned, obviously I think the military one has an immediate kind of a demonstration of import, right?
[95:34.43]People look at someone in military regalia and they go, oh, that person's military.
[95:40.49]And it advertises about you very quick and says that you're a serious person.
[95:44.54]I would say get yourself a really nice suit.
[95:47.64]There's something about a man in a really dignified suit that immediately indicates, oh, this is a person of importance.
[95:54.32]If you're looking for that feeling again, get a power suit.
[95:57.10]Dress well.
[95:57.80]Ooh, that's fun.
[95:59.15]Yeah.
[96:00.39]Power suit.
[96:01.63]As for being told what to do with your life, get a wife.
[96:06.85]Right?
[96:07.83]Get yourself a wife or a husband, whatever you're into.
[96:10.59]And just have them boss you around.
[96:13.39]Right, cutie?
[96:14.55]I don't do that.
[96:15.92]Meh.
[96:17.94]Alright, that's it.
[96:19.82]That's it?
[96:20.34]We helped so many people.
[96:22.82]Yeah, we did.
[96:23.78]We really helped them.
[96:24.56]We told the man fair shadow of the military to sell those feet.
[96:28.30]I'm sure there's a market for 10-year military veteran feet.
[96:32.37]Yeah, there is.
[96:33.35]Those are some tough feet, baby.
[96:37.10]Yeah.
[96:37.52]Do you like feet?
[96:38.94]I accidentally clicked on my tab with Harry Potter pickup lines, and I got a little hot and heavy over here.
[96:44.12]Oh, you got more than you bargained for.
[96:45.60]Got a good one?
[96:46.46]Oh, what's he doing with the Nimbus 2000 over there?
[96:48.98]Yeah, when I said ACO Hottie, I didn't expect it would work.
[96:52.53]Oh, yeah.
[96:52.83]That one really got me feeling all sorts of ways.
[96:55.73]Sorry about that.
[96:56.21]So, Hottie, did you two have fun?
[96:57.17]Yeah, this is awesome.
[96:58.89]Yeah.
[96:59.65]Jack, did you have fun?
[97:02.45]I don't know.
[97:03.93]What did they say?
[97:04.35]Did they say yes?
[97:05.41]I don't know.
[97:06.29]I saw a yes.
[97:07.03]I saw at least two.
[97:07.97]Well, anyway, first of all, let me say thank you to my co-host, Cutie Cinderella.
[97:12.21]She's wonderful.
[97:12.79]This is her first time on the show.
[97:13.95]We will have her back.
[97:15.23]I'm so excited to have her.
[97:17.28]She's wonderful.
[97:18.32]Cutie, you got anything coming up?
[97:20.34]I'm going camping next week with some friends.
[97:22.54]What the hell does that have to do with this?
[97:24.24]And it should be fun.
[97:26.06]I just am telling you about my life.
[97:27.12]I don't know.
[97:27.56]I'm going camping.
[97:28.58]Is that going to be like a show?
