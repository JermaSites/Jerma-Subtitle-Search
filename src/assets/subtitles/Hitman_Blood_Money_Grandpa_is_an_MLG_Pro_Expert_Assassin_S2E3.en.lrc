[00:12.93]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15.15]It's Grandpa here, and today I have some Hitman, the blood money.
[00:21.29]And today I want to play this game because Hitman Absolution, the sequel to this, is coming out pretty soon.
[00:27.49]So I want to get and just show you my special techniques and how I take out the bad guys.
[00:33.47]So this is the vineyard level.
[00:35.73]And this is the guy we're gonna kill right here.
[00:37.26]He's right by the door.
[00:38.72]So this is a good technique.
[00:39.96]What you wanna do is you pull out the mine.
[00:42.74]And who gives a shit about these people running around?
[00:45.60]You just wanna drop it in... Wait, where is he?
[00:47.80]I think he's right here.
[00:49.36]Drop the landmine, take a little stroll over here, pull out the detonator, and see you later, motherfuckers!
[00:56.68]What an explosion that was!
[00:59.20]This is the guy.
[01:00.67]Oh.
[01:01.81]Well, I killed him anyway, so if you don't kill him with the blast, then just... Jesus, that was rough.
[01:08.89]Also, this game is all about stealth.
[01:10.99]You want to be really quiet, and you want to use a syringe to make sure you put the people to sleep and not kill them.
[01:16.80]Hey!
[01:17.74]What are you doing?
[01:18.54]Don't shoot it!
[01:19.64]Don't shoot!
[01:22.08]Okay, let's try this again.
[01:23.90]Pull out the mine.
[01:24.76]Everybody runs scared.
[01:26.18]Yeah, yeah, get the fuck out of my way.
[01:27.84]I don't want to deal with whoever he is.
[01:29.12]Drop the mine.
[01:29.62]Come on, come on, come on.
[01:30.45]I've never done this before.
[01:31.61]Come on.
[01:32.49]Yes, I did it.
[01:33.77]I actually did it.
[01:34.65]Okay, now I have to... I don't know what to do now.
[01:37.69]That's the first time I've ever done that.
[01:40.02]Oh, okay, pull out the machine gun.
[01:42.52]I don't know what to do!
[01:44.18]I don't have any bullets left!
[01:45.68]This is stupid!
[01:47.34]Okay, I should, um, think here, Grandpa.
[01:49.48]Come on, think!
[01:50.36]I gotta just... Oh my god, grab a gun!
[01:52.68]Grab somebody's gun!
[01:55.02]Seriously, what the fuck is going on here?
[01:58.82]Okay, so, I've come to the realization that you're not supposed to use the mine.
[02:03.37]So I'm just gonna drop it at the beginning of the level, so nobody sees it, I don't get in any trouble, and then... What?
[02:11.09]What?
[02:11.69]What?! !
[02:13.14]What'd you... Why'd that guy just picked up the mine?
[02:16.30]Hold on a second, what is this guy doing?
[02:19.26]Excuse me, you just picked up a fucking mine!
[02:23.33]So this is hands down one of the weirdest things that's ever goddamn happened to me in a video game.
[02:29.37]So this guy has the mine, can I blow him up?
[02:32.16]Can I detonate this guy in this entire goddamn room, are you serious?
[02:38.71]You know, typically I would laugh at something like this.
[02:41.77]But that was just sad.
