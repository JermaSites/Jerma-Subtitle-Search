[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.39]Oh, I got here as soon as I could.
[00:06.67]I saw the time ticking down.
[00:07.85]I was like, wait a minute.
[00:08.81]3 to 4 p.m.
[00:09.39]I gotta go.
[00:13.52]I did the sprint where both your hands... You know, you do the... One hand up, flat.
[00:19.58]Right hand up, flat.
[00:22.40]Over and over again.
[00:23.00]Just straight up.
[00:24.15]Like an old lady on the sidewalk.
[00:27.41]That's what I did.
[00:29.47]Alright, let me tweet it.
[00:30.19]Give me one sec.
[01:30.53]Alrighty.
[01:32.25]So, today, my wonderful, wonderful, wonderful audience of mine, we got a bunch of PlayStation 2 stuff to do.
[01:43.18]Remember I mentioned a few weeks ago that there was still a ton of stuff that I didn't do, I didn't cover?
[01:50.92]Well, it's here.
[01:54.20]And I don't know the exact process we're going to do here, because some of these are probably really good.
[02:02.09]And I might have to throw away my 45 minute and then bust the way that I do things.
[02:12.68]So... We'll have to figure that out.
[02:22.58]Yes, I'm realizing how not good that just sounded.
[02:25.63]It's okay.
[02:25.85]I'm going to have to change the way that I do things maybe because, for instance, some of these are really highly requested.
[02:33.11]I got PsyOps, the Mindgate conspiracy.
[02:35.79]That's one of the most highly requested PlayStation 2 games from people in this community.
[02:44.96]And that, I don't know if I want to give that one like 30 minutes.
[02:50.58]Also, I got another Family Feud.
[02:55.48]This might even be the same game, just on PS2.
[02:58.60]No, I don't think it is.
[03:03.10]Uh... I got a bunch.
[03:07.08]So, I'm gonna go a few days in a row here.
[03:12.14]And we'll try to go through them.
[03:14.70]After this weekend here... I'm gonna go back to some newer games that have come out recently.
[03:25.72]So, we're talking about... Well, you did a bunch of VR shit!
[03:28.77]Here's the PlayStation 2!
[03:29.67]Here's the Dreamcast!
[03:31.34]We're gonna go back to some newer releases after this weekend.
[03:37.86]But I did want to get a lot of this out of the way.
[03:39.92]And Vive comes back too.
[03:42.67]I got too much stuff to do.
[03:45.13]Why can't humans just be awake for 48 hours?
[03:48.95]You know, I wish we had a 48 hour day.
[03:53.07]If humans could sleep for like four hours, be fully rested...
[03:59.22]You can try.
[04:00.22]Alright, so... I mean, the one we're gonna start with here is one that is closest to my heart, I think.
[04:14.37]The one that it just sears into my body.
[04:17.65]It's one of my favorite things I've ever seen in my life.
[04:20.59]And of course, I'm talking about... Hold on, let me make sure there's no naked person on the camera.
[04:26.20]Now, I'm talking about... Well, the whole bit kind of got ruined, but what I'm talking about here... Is Ed, Edd, and Eddie.
[04:33.98]The Misadventures of Ed, Edd, and Eddie.
[04:36.04]There it is.
[04:45.17]That could have gone smoother with the reveal there.
[04:53.71]What's up with your hair?
[04:54.99]What do you mean?
[05:00.94]What's wrong with it?
[05:06.60]What's wrong with my hair?
[05:09.64]Because I was in the shower.
[05:13.77]I'm in Vegas.
[05:14.77]It's hot here.
[05:18.27]Why are you in a tank top?
[05:19.25]I'm in Las Vegas.
[05:20.45]It's fucking like 150 degrees here every day.
[05:29.45]You look like a shitty backup actor for an MTV video.
[05:32.23]That's your opinion, okay?
[05:34.89]And you're allowed to have a wrong one, but that is yours.
[05:39.63]Let's get it started.
[05:41.27]Ed, Edd n Eddy, The Misadventures.
[05:43.51]The Mis-Edventures.
[05:44.99]I'm gonna piss a lot of people off, I think, with this one.
[05:50.78]Because I'm gonna play this for... Here's what's gonna happen, we'll break it down.
[05:53.22]Hold on, let me just get my controller.
[05:55.56]I'm gonna play this for 15 minutes.
[05:58.41]and I'm gonna be like okay uh so walk over here uh grab this box okay cool that's uh funny uh what do I do now nothing like really interesting is happening um how do I I'm streaming I'm streaming what do I say uh I'm gonna grab this thing oh I grabbed ed by like the shoulder I threw him nothing's funny nothing interesting is happening what do I do about this
[06:27.64]That's going to be going on internally in my head.
[06:30.26]And then I'm going to turn it off in like 30 minutes.
[06:31.70]Go, yeah, it's pretty cool.
[06:32.64]I mean, I remember it was like fun.
[06:33.82]If you liked it, that's cool.
[06:40.25]All right, let's see.
[06:40.97]Can I even hear anything?
[06:46.53]All right, here we go.
[06:49.09]Yeah, yeah.
[06:51.81]Before we start PlayStation 2 night, can we get some yeahs?
[07:04.15]Checking memory card.
[07:06.37]Had to end any of these adventures.
[07:08.11]Use an autosave feature.
[07:11.73]Cartoon Network.
[07:13.45]Interactive.
[07:17.79]Midway.
[07:18.23]Really?
[07:18.55]I didn't know they made this.
[07:22.47]Bink Video.
[07:24.63]They patented, like, one screen.
[07:28.83]40 years ago.
[07:30.01]And now they're in every single video game.
[07:43.48]A to win I'm not gonna criticize this game, you know think I'm aware of the the backlash I would receive
[08:04.52]I'm not gonna move yet.
[08:12.51]Holy shit, this brings back memories?
[08:13.85]Yeah, that's why I don't want to make fun of it.
[08:16.01]Not that I was going to.
[08:16.87]Uh, this needs to be moved, though.
[08:21.25]Is the color correct?
[08:22.03]It looks weird.
[08:25.12]Where's Ed?
[08:27.82]What happened to Ed?
[08:29.60]How come he didn't say his name?
[08:33.76]Wait, hold on a minute.
[08:37.18]Turn it up.
[08:37.82]Listen.
[08:38.06]Does he say his name?
[08:40.46]I heard Ed.
[08:42.46]Eddie!
[08:47.15]Oh god, fuck it.
[08:48.25]Whatever.
[08:48.51]Why is Turbo on?
[08:52.43]Why is Turbo on?
[08:54.21]I don't want Turbo.
[09:00.07]Okay, new game.
[09:04.22]Uh, there's no save file.
[09:05.42]Make one.
[09:09.50]If somebody wants to make, like, a video, I'm just going to give you an idea for a video.
[09:13.18]Whoever wants to make it, go for it.
[09:15.10]Uh, this is not my idea.
[09:16.66]This is an idea of somebody that would think this is a good idea.
[09:18.74]It's not my idea.
[09:21.50]Continue without... Wait, what?
[09:23.18]Eddie's game?
[09:23.82]Ed's game?
[09:24.48]Does it matter?
[09:26.46]Let's do Eddie.
[09:29.61]So remember, this is not my idea.
[09:31.05]If you want, you know Venom, how he calls him Eddie throughout the course of the movie?
[09:38.70]You could put like Venom in here as like, Ed, Ed, Eddie.
[09:42.86]That video would get like at least 12,000 views.
[09:51.22]So, Sockhead, where are we gonna get enough ice to make snow cones?
[09:54.90]I'm sure we could locate sufficient frost shavings in the backyard coolers of the neighborhood kids, Eddie.
[10:00.95]I love how much everybody hates this.
[10:02.51]Alright, I gotta slow down because I got like two or three everybody hates this things in the first like five minutes of this stream.
[10:13.59]Haven't I learned I gotta stop like intentionally hate this?
[10:16.28]Collect ice cubes to make snow cones.
[10:21.83]Select Ed by pressing R1.
[10:23.11]Okay.
[10:23.83]Select Ed so you can cycle through.
[10:27.19]When an object blows, it means that you can interact with it by pressing the triangle button.
[10:34.58]Alright, so there's a... Okay, I got the... I got the potato slicer.
[10:41.46]Let's get Ice Cube.
[10:45.67]Can you throw shit?
[10:47.19]Okay.
[10:47.73]Good work.
[10:48.13]Ed's special ability is to lift and throw objects.
[10:54.34]And what do we got for... What is his move?
[10:57.34]Press the square button to do basic attack.
[11:01.56]He has a punch?
[11:02.28]Okay.
[11:02.66]So the ice cubes are supposed to be... From my understanding here... They're like puzzle pieces from Banjo, or stars from Mario.
[11:16.35]Alright, so that's the... So... Don't be mad at me, I don't know who is who.
[11:22.93]I'm just gonna say, I'm gonna say, add one, two, and three.
[11:25.95]Oh, they all, he has an attack, too.
[11:32.82]Alright, let's go.
[11:34.88]Now, he has a slingshot.
[11:37.44]Does Eddie have a grenade?
[11:40.88]Launch a stink bomb.
[11:41.82]Most enemies are stunned by stink bombs.
[11:43.32]Okay.
[11:45.72]They all have their own version of the Naruto run.
[11:52.73]He looks like he's trying to do the Narrow to a Run, but he doesn't have any bones.
[11:58.54]Okay.
[12:00.02]Stink Bomb.
[12:05.22]Okay.
[12:05.80]So we can push... Launch a Stink Bomb.
[12:08.86]Okay, so... How do we launch him?
[12:11.16]Press L1 with Ed to perform the Batter Ed Formation.
[12:15.03]This move can be used to smash through objects.
[12:19.33]That's pretty awesome.
[12:24.84]Pretty cool game.
[12:25.54]Pretty fun.
[12:30.16]If you liked this game back in the day, that's cool, because it's good.
[12:33.23]It's pretty good.
[12:34.35]Alright, I got something.
[12:37.71]How do I get this off?
[12:40.11]What's on me?
[12:42.49]What is attached to me?
[12:44.99]Why do I have an animal on me?
[12:47.32]Find a cat to lift and throw at the dog to get him away from the cooler.
[12:51.00]So the cooler... How do I get this off me?
[12:54.29]Ed's gonna die!
[12:58.69]Okay.
[13:04.23]No, get off of me!
[13:10.64]Alright, he died.
[13:16.76]Watch out for the squirrels.
[13:17.46]Why are there so many squirrels?
[13:18.90]Alright, I gotta hit them.
[13:21.46]Alright, press with Ed to dig in the sand.
[13:25.33]Chickens are present in each level.
[13:26.95]Catch the chicken by stunning it.
[13:28.73]And then grab it with Ed.
[13:31.05]Watch out, watch out!
[13:34.35]God dammit, which one of these is Ed?
[13:36.83]Ed's the big one, right?
[13:42.57]Eddie is...
[13:52.42]Re-try.
[13:54.08]I gotta grab- Chicken's a present, and each little cat is stunning it, and then grab it.
[13:58.17]Why do I have, like, a fucking trash can?
[14:01.71]Where did I get a trash can?
[14:02.97]Alright, I think Chicken's done.
[14:11.03]This one's Eddie, right?
[14:12.25]The one with the sock on his head?
[14:21.01]No, that's Ed.
[14:25.78]Who's the one with the antenna?
[14:28.44]This is Ed with one D. This is Eddie, right?
[14:36.82]Also Ed.
[14:45.19]Ed's the big one.
[14:46.35]Eddie is the one... Okay, Eddie's the one with the antenna.
[14:51.07]Eddie's the one with the yellow shirt.
[14:59.63]Alright, let's go get that COOLER!
[15:04.77]Got that cube.
[15:07.12]Uh, there's a sandbox somewhere that I need to dig in.
[15:10.32]Alright, where's the sandbox?
[15:11.66]Switch to Eddie.
[15:24.07]No, I went all the way back to the part of the house.
[15:26.33]You're horrible at this.
[15:27.61]Well, come on, man.
[15:28.49]I haven't even seen the show.
[15:29.79]I've watched like five episodes.
[15:32.53]I don't know what's going on in this TV show.
[15:34.13]How can I be good at the game if I've never seen the show?
[15:35.95]Okay, I need a cat.
[15:38.69]Cat, cat, cat.
[15:50.48]Cat.
[15:51.08]I'm looking for a cat.
[15:52.96]Cat the tree?
[15:56.78]I'll find a cat.
[15:59.38]Alright, hold on.
[16:02.06]No cat here.
[16:02.68]But I can dig in the sand.
[16:04.50]Alright, that's Ed.
[16:09.25]Ed's the one with 1D.
[16:18.77]Costume piece.
[16:21.45]I really feel like that Eddie would do a great Smash Mouth impression.
[16:27.30]Is there something?
[16:27.74]Did he ever do that?
[16:28.46]Did he ever sing that song?
[16:30.24]Any Smash Mouth songs?
[16:31.32]I feel like he would be pretty good at it.
[16:33.74]Get that cat.
[16:42.41]They did that once?
[16:44.79]Yeah, I would assume.
[16:45.49]This is a cat, right?
[16:55.88]Alright, well, I got another, uh, puzzle piece.
[16:58.98]Why don't they all, like, jump in the air at the same time when you collect it?
[17:01.18]3 to 5.
[17:01.92]Alright, let's keep going.
[17:08.85]No Edds allowed.
[17:10.19]Well, that's alright.
[17:10.81]I'm Eddy.
[17:15.32]Cut scene.
[17:15.92]Look, another cooler.
[17:17.60]More ice for my scam.
[17:19.24]But first, we gotta get rid of that loudmouth sister of yours, Ed.
[17:24.34]Quick, Sockhead.
[17:25.26]Use your slingshot on Jimmy's dolls.
[17:27.46]Violence only begets violence, Eddie.
[17:30.15]Violence only begets violence, Eddie.
[17:32.47]Do it, man.
[17:33.19]Come on.
[17:34.11]Okay, let's go.
[17:47.89]R2 button.
[17:49.07]You can go to FPS mode?
[17:53.03]You kidding me?
[17:55.00]Now jump on the picnic table and use the slingshot on Jimmy's dolls!
[18:01.22]I can't go over there though, wait.
[18:05.69]Is this a picnic table?
[18:07.35]This looks like just a plank of wood.
[18:08.67]Alright, let's go.
[18:09.13]How do I shoot it?
[18:11.63]Circle?
[18:16.03]Well, there's bullet drop.
[18:30.95]I did it, right?
[18:34.35]How do I get out again?
[18:34.93]Let's go.
[18:36.29]This is actually kind of fun.
[18:38.23]I was talking a little shit at the beginning about how I was going to just skip it, but... It's not bad.
[18:42.56]Not a bad game.
[18:49.36]We got four to five?
[18:50.06]No, it's not bad.
[18:52.86]It's fun.
[18:55.92]I mean, it could use a little work in the graphical department, but... Throw squirrels into the window of the house?
[19:03.49]Why would I do that?
[19:04.15]Like this house, right here.
[19:19.14]Come here.
[19:21.15]No, yeah, I would have had it.
[19:25.15]You got a f***ing squirrel problem.
[19:28.83]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[19:31.59]Not the red squirrel!
[19:32.53]Get the red squirrel off me!
[19:35.99]Get away from me!
[19:36.74]No more red squirrel!
[19:41.58]Alright, come here.
[19:48.31]Dude, they used to have a... They made cartoons... Look at how good this cartoon was back in the day.
[19:54.19]They had a whole orchestra.
[19:57.27]They had a whole jazz orchestra playing these songs to each episode.
[20:00.29]They make these goddamn songs on a computer now.
[20:03.82]Oops.
[20:06.34]There's the jazz orchestra.
[20:14.13]There's a conductor, and the special features of the Ed, Edd n Eddy DVD.
[20:23.67]You can see the whole orchestra play.
[20:26.73]Uh, what?
[20:28.69]How do you... Lift and throw squirrels into the window of the house.
[20:34.28]Isn't that what it is?
[20:34.78]Is this the wrong house?
[20:37.58]What the fuck am I doing?
[20:40.20]Why are we doing a cheerleading?
[20:42.80]I think they'll do like a reunion episode.
[20:54.08]where the actors come back, and they're a little too old, and you can tell they're really trying, but they don't really... they sound different.
[21:04.01]For some reason, The Simpsons has... The Simpsons voice actors sound exactly the same as they did 30 years ago.
[21:09.61]It's insane.
[21:13.18]It's insane.
[21:17.92]person that does lisa still is this is the exact same voice but edited they were talented people it was really cool they did great jobs two of them died oh god that's terrible so what's that supposed to
[21:48.50]Where am I taking the squirrel?
[21:50.24]I forgot what to do already.
[21:52.28]Yeah, I missed that cutscene because we were talking.
[21:53.76]Well, I was talking.
[21:55.74]You were watching me forget where I was going while I was talking.
[22:00.14]That's not true.
[22:04.14]Wait, what?
[22:08.68]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[22:09.38]So, are they...
[22:14.28]We were talking.
[22:15.31]Lift and throw the fridge at the door.
[22:16.93]Alright, let's throw the fridge.
[22:21.47]Okay, use the battering head.
[22:24.03]Put the scroll down here.
[22:27.49]Okay, so let's do the battering head.
[22:28.99]How do I stop doing this?
[22:32.93]I got five.
[22:40.42]What is this thing?
[22:41.62]A coin?
[22:42.94]Ooh, I got two coins!
[22:44.12]Three coins, four coins!
[22:45.96]Three coins, four coins.
[22:47.61]Oh.
[22:50.43]We did it.
[22:50.95]That's it.
[22:52.83]Let's just... let's do the speedrun tactic, man.
[22:55.23]This is faster.
[22:59.95]Meatball machine.
[23:00.55]Hey!
[23:01.21]Check out those balls!
[23:02.55]They're just the right size for my scam!
[23:07.92]He didn't really translate the 3D very well.
[23:11.02]He's got a very strange mouth for 3D.
[23:12.84]It looks like Bart.
[23:13.82]That's like 55 year old Bart Simpson.
[23:34.86]Okay.
[23:41.83]He is ugly.
[23:44.03]Oh, pigs.
[23:44.61]Batter and the pig's gate.
[23:46.72]That should change Rolf's mind about the meatball.
[23:55.06]Do I get to ride a pig?
[23:56.36]Lift and throw the pigs back in the pen.
[23:57.74]Okay.
[23:57.90]Sounds easy enough.
[23:58.60]Aww, I can't throw it over?
[23:59.32]I do appreciate the default pig sound.
[24:24.97]Is it just mini-games?
[24:25.87]Probably.
[24:33.82]Oh, come on.
[24:34.46]Will he just walk in?
[24:37.90]There we go.
[24:39.74]Alright, and there's what?
[24:41.16]One more?
[24:41.48]Two more?
[24:47.44]This game is worse than I remember.
[24:50.30]I think it still holds up a little.
[24:51.88]I mean, I never played it.
[24:56.78]Alright, let's use the machine.
[24:57.74]Is there another pig?
[25:03.90]Can we use the machine?
[25:07.12]Is there another pig somewhere?
[25:10.59]Oh, the fucking red squirrel got me again!
[25:19.65]He said yes.
[25:20.61]Well, how do I get on it?
[25:23.41]Get the red squirrel away from me!
[25:27.20]Does the smart one have to use it?
[25:36.12]How do I get back in this house?
[25:40.66]No, there's no- there's no- there's no pig here!
[25:45.28]Look.
[25:49.15]Can one of you party members just turn and just fucking blast that squirrel?
[25:59.72]Okay, see?
[26:06.29]Stop running out!
[26:07.01]They just keep running out!
[26:12.64]I gotta go in like his fucking shed!
[26:14.46]Alright, let's activate the meatball machine.
[26:25.39]My, my.
[26:27.13]Intriguing.
[26:28.51]You just completed scam number one.
[26:30.77]Cool your ed.
[26:33.20]Ten percent game completion.
[26:39.24]Fully animated?
[26:42.84]Snow cones for suckers!
[26:45.97]We're gonna be rich, I tell ya!
[26:47.93]Kind of.
[26:58.72]Stop eating those!
[27:02.18]Why did you just turn into Skeeter from Doug?
[27:15.86]Col de Sac.
[27:17.16]Can we get a sewer?
[27:21.21]Is this open world?
[27:22.71]Leave the level and go- no, no, not yet, not yet.
[27:26.74]Let's really examine the suburbs of Ohio.
[27:34.29]I don't even know what the hell they are.
[27:36.95]What town were they in?
[27:39.13]Anything else I can do?
[27:50.16]I can imagine being a big fan of this show when it was really, really popular.
[27:55.24]And walking around and like going in Jimmy's pool.
[27:58.40]And being like, wow.
[28:02.20]Talking to Ralph.
[28:04.84]Picking up paint cans.
[28:05.86]They love painting, right?
[28:11.05]I never said where.
[28:11.67]Nah, let's just go to the next one.
[28:13.39]This one's in the sewer.
[28:17.52]The show fucking sucked.
[28:18.48]I'm glad it died.
[28:19.40]Wow.
[28:19.96]That's heavy, man.
[28:20.96]What?
[28:21.24]Wait a minute.
[28:22.14]We can't let a chump like Rolf keep us from this party.
[28:23.98]We gotta get in there.
[28:37.49]I like this.
[28:38.35]This is very fun.
[28:39.79]Pin the tail on the Ed.
[29:12.53]The animation doesn't give the TV show animation justice?
[29:16.61]Yeah, but, I mean, it is a PlayStation 2 game.
[29:19.79]Find a way into Jimmy's backyard.
[29:30.70]Can you watch Ed, Edd n Eddy, like, the whole thing anymore, or do you have to buy the DVDs or Blu-rays or something?
[29:37.40]Is it possible to play this?
[29:40.42]Not play this, but watch it?
[29:41.74]I don't know.
[29:42.94]It seems terribly risky and unsanitary, to say the least.
[29:47.52]Throw toxic waste?
[29:49.14]Shit, we're gonna talk about alligators.
[29:56.80]The whole show is on YouTube.
[29:58.90]Well, I'm talking like a legal way to watch it.
[30:04.30]Not like Edfan2044 that uploads every video.
[30:17.07]Oh my god, get the fucking alligator.
[30:18.98]How do you kill the alligator?
[30:21.72]Just dive through it.
[30:27.85]They're not gonna throw you in prison for watching a YouTube show.
[30:30.69]Great!
[30:31.43]What are we supposed to do now?
[30:33.02]It's elementary, Eddie.
[30:34.66]If we move down into the water on the other side, you two can lift me up to that crank.
[30:39.36]I'll lower the bridge, allowing us to cross together.
[30:42.21]V5 bullfarm, I smell cheese and onion buns.
[30:48.80]Alright, switch to add and press L1 to enter Trampolad.
[30:52.02]So we're gonna launch add up there to turn the dial.
[31:01.59]Can we go in this?
[31:03.17]Maybe we can.
[31:04.83]Is it poison or is it not?
[31:06.17]It's an alligator.
[31:06.75]Alright, do it.
[31:10.47]No, I'm gonna die!
[31:12.43]I'm gonna lose!
[31:26.21]You're killing him.
[31:32.34]I'm gonna take their souls.
[31:34.38]What are they doing?
[31:34.88]Oh.
[31:35.68]Their pathing is getting up there.
[31:38.30]Where's the most powerful technique?
[31:42.96]I can throw the... Okay, the stink bomb.
[31:50.88]Alright, watch out.
[31:52.60]Am I gonna collect a day of souls?
[31:55.60]No, no!
[31:56.18]It's okay.
[31:57.24]I don't think you can kill the alligators.
[32:07.71]Maybe you can.
[32:10.23]No, you definitely can't.
[32:15.03]Alright, alright, alright.
[32:16.63]Okay, okay.
[32:17.39]Easy, easy, easy.
[32:20.85]I'm gonna have to, like, Battering Ram that thing.
[32:22.35]Jesus Christ!
[32:23.51]This thing is relentless!
[32:28.51]Why is it still swimming on land?
[32:30.15]That doesn't make any sense.
[32:34.01]This is not fair.
[32:35.07]This is fucking unfair!
[32:41.16]Alright, Battering Ram this.
[32:46.40]Battering Ram.
[32:47.18]Now I need a key.
[32:52.07]Alright, I have to get a key.
[32:55.77]I'm just gonna throw the grenade.
[32:57.71]Fuck it.
[32:58.11]How do I throw the grenade?
[33:05.46]There it is.
[33:06.16]Okay.
[33:06.70]I need a key to open this door.
[33:09.18]I gotta go back.
[33:16.83]Find key.
[33:22.24]Key.
[33:23.58]What am I standing in?
[33:37.85]Kill the alligators.
[33:38.87]I don't think I can.
[33:42.23]I tried, I hit them like three or four times.
[33:46.94]They swim around like Aquaman, and then you can't hurt them.
[34:01.60]You can kill them.
[34:02.48]Alright, well it's good to know.
[34:05.20]I'm gonna find a key.
[34:07.82]Oh, that was a coin.
[34:15.11]Can I throw these as many times as I want?
[34:19.47]I can.
[34:19.73]Can I just get Infinity Moth?
[34:27.34]Well, he's the best character in the game.
[34:29.16]Alright.
[34:30.30]Key.
[34:33.70]No key.
[34:35.64]No key.
[34:36.04]And barrel.
[34:36.76]Boxes.
[34:37.98]Toxic waste.
[34:43.13]Where would I... If I was a key, where would I be hiding?
[34:49.17]Anybody have anything to say about this?
[34:57.76]That's the Dark Souls shortcut.
[35:08.56]Nothing in there?
[35:13.03]So they said switch to Ed.
[35:16.89]Wait, what?
[35:17.45]You can just open locked doors?
[35:19.91]When did you possess this skill?
[35:21.51]Yeah, Ed knows how to pick locks.
[35:31.17]I thought that was a key.
[35:32.35]What do you mean?
[35:32.95]I thought that was a joke.
[35:33.87]I thought there was a key involved.
[35:43.12]That's double D, you charlatan.
[35:47.67]Alright, well, what's that down there?
[35:54.17]Got it.
[35:57.46]This looks like a real ED level.
[36:00.10]Yeah, I wonder what would happen if you didn't have Double D. Would they just die?
[36:10.70]Double D?
[36:14.08]Why am I calling it Double D?
[36:15.48]It's ED.
[36:18.01]Edward.
[36:20.35]I love that they're just standing around.
[36:31.49]Watch the show.
[36:33.59]I've seen the show.
[36:34.60]I know the show.
[36:36.02]I know about Plank.
[36:38.56]Plank is his little friend, Jimmy.
[36:41.98]I know about the sisters, right?
[36:46.36]I've seen the show.
[36:51.22]I know that they put jawbreakers in their mouths and that's like all they care about is candy.
[37:02.61]He's a fake fan.
[37:06.35]Name a favorite episode.
[37:09.49]I can't do that.
[37:10.93]I got like a clam on me now.
[37:12.55]Okay, I need to do something.
[37:21.85]Who can touch these?
[37:26.41]Favorite episode?
[37:27.15]Favorite episode?
[37:27.79]Um... An episode of Ed, Edd n Eddy that I remember.
[37:40.65]They got a super jawbreaker one time, right?
[37:42.55]It was a huge one.
[37:48.14]I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[37:53.46]What is an episode of Ed, Edd n Eddy that I've ever seen?
[37:57.48]But I can't even do that with The Simpsons.
[38:00.85]Right?
[38:01.09]Okay, name a Simpsons episode that's not like Treehouse of Horror.
[38:10.93]I can't.
[38:19.03]There we go.
[38:19.45]We got some doors here.
[38:21.91]Mr. Plow?
[38:22.69]Yeah, but that's... I guess, like, you just said that.
[38:25.45]I didn't.
[38:30.84]I'm trying!
[38:31.72]What is an episode of Ed, Edd n Eddy that I've ever seen?
[38:34.48]I've seen a bunch of them a long time ago.
[38:37.64]Ugh.
[38:45.10]Did somebody steal a plank one time and replace it with another piece of wood?
[38:49.96]No.
[38:53.53]You sure?
[38:54.11]Alright, I need to do something with the clam.
[38:57.93]That didn't do anything.
[39:18.82]What the fuck?
[39:19.62]Alright, hold on.
[39:20.94]There's an Ed King back here.
[39:23.96]I don't want this thing to bite me.
[39:29.77]Come here, Ed.
[39:32.71]Just, who cares?
[39:33.97]Just let it bite you.
[39:36.17]I'm gonna bring you over here.
[39:37.77]Just drown the clam.
[39:43.22]Do it!
[39:43.76]Do it!
[39:44.62]Do it!
[39:44.94]What's this, like, Tomb Raider bullshit?
[39:46.30]Like, you gotta be right in front of it?
[39:47.32]Come on!
[39:50.74]Ugh.
[40:00.16]Alright, got it.
[40:01.38]Chicken!
[40:03.60]Chicken!
[40:04.38]Chicken!
[40:05.60]I got it!
[40:12.57]Bingo.
[40:14.92]Two out of six.
[40:15.40]Alright, nothing else over here?
[40:25.76]I can't name an episode!
[40:30.29]What is an episode?
[40:31.95]Even one plot device?
[40:34.85]I don't know.
[40:39.77]Get off of me, please!
[40:47.66]I'm just gonna farm HP.
[40:50.08]I need a better, like, attacker.
[40:53.26]There we go.
[40:57.80]Now, you guys are giving a lot of good answers here, but those are not my answers.
[41:02.82]I remember when Worf was involved in an episode...
[41:18.79]Let me look around here.
[41:24.69]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[41:28.81]No, you can't say next.
[41:29.93]You can't do that yet.
[41:30.61]It's only been four- fuck, it's been 41 minutes!
[41:37.29]I can't leave this game until I tell you a Ed, Edd n Eddy plot device from one episode that I've ever seen.
[41:43.55]I refuse.
[41:48.67]I would be upset at myself if I didn't do that.
[41:56.58]It's like a lever I have to pull?
[42:03.52]Come on, Double D. He says that.
[42:08.02]Is it one where... Is it one where, like, Ed... Is it one where Ed is not smart?
[42:13.11]He doesn't... Like, he gets, like, dumb or something?
[42:16.55]He's not that smart and they realize that they need his intelligence or something?
[42:20.87]He gets, like, dumb?
[42:27.71]Yes, yes.
[42:30.48]No, I'm talking about, like, Double D. Double D, like, loses his brain power or something, right?
[42:34.04]Like, gets his brain power somehow messed up?
[42:39.02]And they spend the whole episode trying to get him smart again?
[42:46.64]Or is that, was that, so Ed gets really, no, Eddie, no, Ed, this one, gets really smart in an episode.
[42:54.97]Right?
[42:59.39]No.
[43:00.37]Yes, I'm not stalling, I'm trying to figure it out.
[43:04.83]I was right the first time.
[43:05.74]Alright, so I can stop playing then.
[43:07.72]Thanks for watching.
[43:10.96]No, I'm kidding.
[43:12.86]I can't leave until I open this door.
[43:16.82]Alright, what about like the Edram?
[43:26.01]No, I eBayed.
[43:27.17]I eBayed this game.
[43:28.09]You think I'm just gonna stop playing it?
[43:29.31]I had to buy this on eBay.
[43:33.91]It took three weeks to get here.
[43:36.71]It was 78 bucks total.
[43:41.22]That's a lie.
[43:41.54]I'm kidding.
[43:41.88]That's a lie.
[43:43.70]How do I do this?
[43:52.06]Am I missing something here?
[43:54.28]Am I missing an episode?
[44:00.05]I have to switch to Ed.
[44:05.13]How do I get such bad deals?
[44:06.47]I'm just kidding.
[44:06.99]This was not 80 bucks.
[44:09.09]He's blind.
[44:09.73]Wait.
[44:12.05]Maybe I am.
[44:12.90]Maybe I am.
[44:14.00]What do I have to do with Ed?
[44:15.92]Touch this thing?
[44:16.88]The elephant trunk?
[44:18.26]Grab the elephant trunk and spin it.
[44:27.54]Hold on a minute.
[44:29.16]How many pizzas are there here?
[44:31.00]There's at least five pizza-shaped things here.
[44:33.56]Look, there's one here.
[44:34.38]There's the elephant trunk that I may have before mentioned.
[44:42.32]It's only glowing when you have Ed selected.
[44:45.24]And I had my favorite character, which is Eddie, selected.
[44:49.06]So it doesn't light up.
[44:51.47]You get it?
[44:54.74]It only lights up when you have the person that can do the reactions selected.
[44:57.22]My favorite part of Ed, Edd n Eddy is nothing to do with the show.
[45:11.49]It's when the guy goes... After that happens, I just turn the channel.
[45:16.98]I change the channel.
[45:27.27]I went in a fucking circle.
[45:31.79]I can't, like, talk!
[45:33.35]Stop talking!
[45:37.43]Frankly, I'm disgusted you don't know which Ed you are.
[45:39.45]I know exactly which Ed I am.
[45:44.71]Was there an episode where one of their cousins, Fred, showed up?
[45:51.57]Do I get bonus points for that one?
[45:56.86]Weren't there three other, like, Ed, Edd, and Eddy?
[45:59.35]Oh, fuck!
[46:00.83]No, I'm fine.
[46:01.79]There are three other Ed, Edd, and Eddys that show up in an episode, right?
[46:04.09]No, not the girls.
[46:12.96]Okay, easy.
[46:23.77]Wait, didn't I... I heard... I went...
[46:28.00]Hold on, did I?
[46:28.76]Where's my map?
[46:32.87]Where's my map?
[46:33.91]I need to press select and see, like, the coordinates of where I am.
[46:41.09]Where's my dungeon map?
[46:42.17]How come you don't have one of those, Ed?
[46:45.98]Okay, remember this?
[46:46.72]Yep, yep, yep, alright.
[46:51.58]I can't take this laugh anymore.
[46:54.54]Alright, then I had the rats here.
[46:55.66]And then that door.
[46:59.02]Is there... Okay, wait.
[46:59.80]Is there... Can I open this?
[47:02.79]Is there like another blind moment?
[47:04.65]See, what about this one?
[47:06.27]I can't use that one.
[47:08.85]What about... I'm just checking.
[47:10.19]I'm just checking to make sure I don't... Fuck it up.
[47:12.72]Look at that.
[47:20.73]Why does he keep laughing?
[47:24.61]Because things are funny!
[47:26.93]Some things are funny!
[47:34.78]Don't lose here.
[47:37.10]They're blocking the way.
[47:39.26]I feel like I'm really neglecting the single Ed, right?
[47:43.60]No, double Ed.
[47:44.76]No, the Eddy.
[47:46.49]Two-syllable Ed.
[47:48.05]I'm neglecting him.
[47:56.76]That's a tough pull here.
[48:02.30]Got it.
[48:02.66]Nice.
[48:04.78]I'm like a fucking lightning rod right now.
[48:06.82]That was fucking so hard.
[48:17.17]Next.
[48:17.59]Next.
[48:17.89]No!
[48:20.21]Not until I add battering ram.
[48:27.20]Alright, let's, uh, let's Ed Break that, right?
[48:34.12]Secret room?
[48:36.81]No, alligator.
[48:45.89]Connect the names with the right characters or fake fan.
[48:48.97]Sure.
[48:54.33]By the way, I never told you I was a fan of the show.
[48:56.67]I told you I've seen the show and that I thought it was okay.
[48:59.08]I thought it was great.
[49:01.18]Let's start from the beginning.
[49:02.50]This is Ed with two D's.
[49:03.68]This is double D. This is E-D-D-Y, Eddie.
[49:10.96]And this is E-D, Ed.
[49:14.84]They're corrected.
[49:19.02]Something else in here I can do.
[49:24.92]And then somebody... What's, um... Isn't somebody, uh...
[49:31.89]D.W.?
[49:34.99]Is it, like, one of these Eds, like... No, that's Arthur.
[49:47.34]Ed D.W.
[49:48.96]No, that's an intro in Arthur.
[49:50.32]Whatever happened to that show?
[49:56.02]You play for longer than you unlock the secret fourth ed.
[49:59.77]Yeah, nice fake fan by the way Like name the characters correctly or you're a fake fan, what about the guys just said there's a fourth ed What are we gonna say about that guy?
[50:27.29]Oh, nice.
[50:27.65]Jawbreaker.
[50:30.44]Is that a secret?
[50:32.24]There's forty of them.
[50:37.86]Judge Dredd.
[50:44.54]Ten years, punk.
[50:49.08]The Fourth Edd.
[50:50.19]Judge Dredd.
[50:54.05]Dredd, Edd, Edd, and Eddie.
[50:56.46]Ed, Dredd, Ed, Ed, Dredd, and Eddie.
[51:01.29]How intriguing.
[51:02.71]The valve to operate that door is missing.
[51:05.99]Well, find it.
[51:07.20]The longer we stand around, the less people will see my latest disco moves.
[51:11.04]How are you doing that?
[51:18.46]I can't do it.
[51:19.36]I can't say that.
[51:20.34]It's too dumb.
[51:21.20]Somebody already did it.
[51:23.08]I'm not doing it.
[51:23.70]Okay buddy.
[51:24.34]Flank says find a way to lower the water so he can get the clams.
[51:28.56]Then he'll give you the valve.
[51:46.77]Alright, turn the valves to lower the water level.
[51:54.83]Okay!
[51:57.47]I need that.
[52:02.65]New valves over here.
[52:04.57]Well, Ed's dead.
[52:06.60]Ed's dead.
[52:07.26]Sorry, Ed.
[52:09.54]Somebody said loser.
[52:13.28]No, no, no.
[52:13.62]Get off.
[52:15.74]He fell in the water.
[52:17.16]And he was never heard from again.
[52:26.97]Hee hee fart joke.
[52:33.07]You guys are acting like I made that joke.
[52:36.17]I didn't!
[52:36.99]What the hell was that?
[52:42.07]Was that Coraline?
[52:44.37]Coraline, open the door!
[52:46.63]Don't talk to mom in there!
[52:49.67]Get out of there!
[52:53.91]It's not what it seems!
[52:56.58]Okay, there's one.
[53:07.57]The water's going down.
[53:09.47]There's one over there.
[53:13.07]Okay.
[53:15.91]Easy.
[53:16.71]Ed!
[53:17.93]Eddie!
[53:20.08]Eddie.
[53:21.60]Did I throw somebody?
[53:22.36]I think, is that it?
[53:24.84]Was it, was it on the valve?
[53:28.68]We gotta get down there.
[53:35.64]I can't tell, it's kind of blurry.
[53:37.70]Can I throw him?
[53:41.25]Does that one... Please stop this game already.
[53:50.51]No, why?
[53:51.47]It's fun.
[53:56.71]I'm begging you, I'm starving.
[53:59.30]Let me at least get to the end of this.
[54:00.64]This is a fun game.
[54:02.60]Well, I obviously have to go down there.
[54:04.94]Is there one over there?
[54:08.46]Ow!
[54:11.99]I don't know who that was.
[54:12.72]That was just Carrot Top.
[54:15.60]I still have a clam on me.
[54:20.98]We're starved for good content.
[54:27.03]You don't like this?
[54:28.33]Alright, this is one of the most requested video games I've ever had on the channel.
[54:36.60]You asked me to make you scrambled eggs with, like, cheese in it.
[54:40.41]Pepper, onions, I sit there all day and I'm at the stove.
[54:42.95]And I'm cooking all these weird eggs you ordered.
[54:45.25]You want, like, hollandaise on it, too.
[54:46.99]And I'm like, really?
[54:47.53]You want, like, hollandaise sauce?
[54:49.71]Yeah!
[54:50.01]And then I put this fucking meal in front of you, and you're like, I don't like the way that smells.
[54:55.94]Get rid of it.
[54:56.82]And I'm like, I just, what?
[54:57.72]I thought you wanted this.
[54:58.68]You wanted eggs with hollandaise.
[55:02.36]And then, like, the rest of the family's at the table.
[55:05.89]Like, the 300 family members that I have.
[55:09.17]I wanted pancakes!
[55:11.03]And I'm just like, I don't have the materials for pancakes right now.
[55:13.93]Get them, Mom!
[55:15.63]Um, I can't.
[55:17.19]The store's closed.
[55:19.27]And then you back up and you walk out.
[55:23.32]You, like, go to your room.
[55:28.72]No, Mom made what Mom made, and if you don't like it...
[55:32.35]That's too bad.
[55:33.65]You gotta eat it.
[55:34.93]It's got broccoli.
[55:35.65]It's got spinach in it.
[55:36.65]If you don't like the spinach, it's gonna make you grow up big and strong.
[55:39.61]Ed, Edd, and Eddie will make you grow up big and strong as long as you don't... Hold on.
[55:46.78]I'm gonna die.
[55:50.22]I gotta get up there.
[55:50.76]I gotta do the Ed Spring.
[55:56.46]Come on.
[55:56.82]Get me up there.
[56:01.99]There's one fucking clam.
[56:06.51]No!
[56:08.83]How do I, like, close the clam's mouth?
[56:14.24]That's it.
[56:15.40]Alright, I beat it.
[56:19.28]Alright, Jimmy.
[56:21.16]Let's go.
[56:23.32]You don't get killed by a clam, but I do.
[56:32.40]Alright.
[56:34.80]Now what?
[56:38.00]Jawbreaker.
[56:44.67]I'm just kidding around, don't worry.
[56:47.57]Do what you want, ignore the chat.
[56:49.15]No, I'm just playing around.
[56:51.83]I know you guys are too, don't worry.
[56:53.17]I know you guys really do love Ed, Edd, and Edd.
[56:55.77]I know you do, that's why I'm gonna keep playing.
[56:59.55]Jimmy, what's wrong with you?
[57:00.96]Jimmy, walk down here.
[57:04.52]Oh, no.
[57:04.98]Please don't remind me to do it again.
[57:08.24]Okay, we're good.
[57:12.58]Jimmy, what do you want?
[57:17.85]Jimmy?
[57:19.27]Hello?
[57:23.95]Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
[57:38.42]Um, where do I go?
[57:40.70]Down here?
[57:48.39]Take the valve.
[57:51.01]Was it... Did he just leave it up there?
[57:59.56]Oh.
[57:59.70]Hey, Johnny.
[58:01.40]Looks like you forgot about your best pal.
[58:03.78]No, Plank.
[58:06.38]So, how about that valve, Johnny?
[58:08.84]These clams look kind of hungry.
[58:11.02]Plank says, bring it on, you sissies.
[58:15.14]Just give us the valve, and I'll give you Plank.
[58:17.62]Plank says you are tricky.
[58:19.40]All right, I'll give up the valve.
[58:21.20]Just don't hurt him.
[58:22.92]All right, Double D, let's install this.
[58:27.41]No, I made that valve.
[58:28.57]I installed that valve.
[58:29.59]I did that.
[58:30.03]Why are you guys running Gabe in?
[58:44.01]Where's the Gabe in coming from?
[58:53.77]Yeah, rats are bigger.
[58:54.63]They're getting thicker.
[58:58.71]Oh, it's because of the... actually, the valve thing, right.
[59:05.65]People still making that joke in, like, 2019?
[59:08.27]Like, the Gaben, Shaver, Steve Shaver.
[59:10.32]Are we still getting that reference and joke?
[59:11.96]In 2019?
[59:12.26]We are?
[59:13.12]No, we're not.
[59:13.98]Enemies here.
[59:27.28]Everybody hates Val.
[59:29.20]That's not true.
[59:29.76]They got three VR games coming up.
[59:32.04]That's what I heard.
[59:36.17]What'd you guys do if I just turned on the webcam right now and just fucking sprinted out of the room?
[59:43.69]And in the chair, like, I was just clicking around and I ran out of the room and Gabe Newell's in the chair.
[59:49.25]Here.
[59:50.09]And he starts talking about his favorite NBA episodes.
[59:56.91]What would that be worth?
[60:06.74]And, by the way, he's getting the names wrong.
[60:08.10]Would you guys still say that shit?
[60:10.00]To Gabe Newell?
[60:10.62]Everyone would be like, idiot!
[60:12.10]No, you wouldn't.
[60:27.93]Credit Diversion.
[60:34.94]Time to break the trampolines.
[60:39.76]I mean, break the piñatas.
[60:43.59]Where are the piñatas?
[60:44.57]Because we like Gabe Newell.
[60:47.61]Okay, you can chop, okay?
[61:04.04]Because we like gay renewal.
[61:06.16]I'm, like, mean, and I'm not going to stand for it.
[61:14.18]This runs like crap.
[61:18.26]I mean, this area does.
[61:19.27]This is a PlayStation 2 game.
[61:26.69]Come on.
[61:36.35]He's like the Pillsbury Doughboy.
[61:41.27]He's making me laugh.
[61:43.21]Alright, cutscene incoming.
[61:49.68]Vandals!
[61:50.40]Hooligans!
[61:51.22]Those are my piñatas!
[61:54.90]Give it a rest, squirt.
[61:56.22]We're professional piñata poppers.
[61:57.84]We're doing you a favor.
[62:05.27]What are they called?
[62:05.77]The Grunge Sisters?
[62:06.63]Fake fan.
[62:09.41]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[62:20.85]Wait, I didn't know I have to go... Beehives.
[62:24.47]Shoot the beehives.
[62:29.04]Did you drop a fridge on them?
[62:31.04]Alright, this is... This reminds me of those old Flash games.
[62:40.19]I'm dead.
[62:42.59]I gotta, like, time it when they run across the screen, because I can't hit them with this.
[62:45.32]Alright, stun, stun, stun, stun, stunning!
[62:54.34]Right there, right there, get it!
[62:57.03]Bingo.
[62:59.35]Right here.
[63:01.55]No, I can't... Oh, she was standing right there!
[63:06.48]Right here, right at this one, right?
[63:08.74]Drop a fridge on her head.
[63:09.70]Got it.
[63:09.98]Back into the sewer.
[63:12.42]Oh god.
[63:23.64]Did I get it?
[63:26.75]I don't think I got it.
[63:28.41]That laugh!
[63:29.05]That laugh is gonna drive me crazy.
[63:31.27]There's more!
[63:32.71]All the way down.
[63:52.33]Oh, get it!
[63:57.25]Damn it.
[64:01.71]Don't do the laugh.
[64:02.49]Please.
[64:04.27]And then right here.
[64:09.23]Shit.
[64:09.51]Drop it on her head!
[64:10.23]Got it.
[64:11.07]No, I didn't.
[64:15.60]Got it.
[64:15.96]You just completed Scam 2 Pin the Tail on the Ed.
[64:19.12]Current game, 19%.
[64:27.02]Animatic cutscene.
[64:28.16]Let's get 50 bucks on that.
[64:31.84]Gross.
[64:57.04]What was that face?
[64:57.64]That didn't even look like him.
[65:00.54]Mini Clips gave 50 bucks.
[65:02.54]Thank you for the $50, Mini Clips.
[65:05.83]Local streamer abused his children live on stream.

[65:15.54]I really appreciate it.
[65:23.95]Alright, so... For real, thank you.
[65:27.97]That's a lot of money.
[65:28.91]Alright, here's the deal.
[65:31.19]If I get this basket in the net first try, I will keep playing the game.
[65:38.93]If I don't get it first try, then I'm gonna keep playing.
[65:44.47]Alright, let's keep going.
[65:52.09]Seventy people are probably just like, no, please!
[65:55.63]Just... you're gonna have to wait.
[65:57.75]Okay.
[65:58.95]I gotta do... no, I don't.
[66:03.78]Let's just see what the next one is.
[66:04.74]We're gonna just see what the next one is!
[66:08.29]Let's at least see the animation.
[66:14.81]Jimmy have a birthday every day second birthday in a row that will advance
[66:39.54]This is Groundhog Day.
[66:42.03]I did something wrong.
[66:43.45]I have to correct it.
[66:44.17]The world is trying to teach me something.
[66:45.81]Oh, okay, it is.
[66:46.13]Let's... Jerma, I'm actually gonna leave.
[67:08.10]Well, I can't stop you.
[67:09.68]All right, exit of the cul-de-sac.
[67:21.95]Bye then.
[67:22.47]Come on, we got three days in a row to do... Just let me enjoy my video game.
[67:29.34]You guys, this is $150 for me to buy this.
[67:36.99]This shady guy, I had to go meet him in a fucking alleyway.
[67:41.94]You want Ed, Edd n Eddy?
[67:43.78]Yeah man, I heard from Craigslist you were selling Ed, Edd n Eddy?
[67:47.36]Yeah.
[67:48.56]You want anything else?
[67:50.97]No, just Ed, Edd n Eddy.
[67:53.07]Like five guys kind of appeared out of the shadows with huge leather jackets on and they had spiked clubs and stuff surrounding me.
[68:03.33]I just gave the guy a fucking wad of hundreds and walked away and he gave me the disc.
[68:15.23]What's over here?
[68:15.89]Okay, here we go.
[68:19.45]New place.
[68:24.77]Yeah, then I heard something behind me as I was walking to my car.
[68:27.93]The fucking Lamborghini, by the way.
[68:29.03]It's a beautiful car.
[68:30.71]So I'm walking towards my Lamborghini, and I'm just kind of swinging my keys around, just kind of a little nervous.
[68:36.72]I hear footsteps behind me.
[68:40.20]And they got close enough.
[68:42.08]where I was able to change my hair in like five minutes.
[68:47.93]My hair changed.
[68:49.09]It was weird because the guy was behind me, but I noticed that my hair changed completely.
[68:52.03]I heard the steps.
[68:54.81]Grab the guy and fucking stone cold stun a headlock and then flip him.
[68:59.27]All right, well, I just broke my head.
[69:01.17]Yeah, that's it.
[69:07.91]Where's the thing that was on it?
[69:11.15]I can't even use this.
[69:14.33]I ripped off the thing that was on it.
[69:15.59]There was like a piece of jelly that was attached to it, and now it's... No, I don't know where it is.
[69:28.22]I can't even use the headphones now.
[69:29.32]Okay, hold on.
[69:34.17]I got it.
[69:35.11]I got it.
[69:39.90]Everything's fine.
[69:41.66]I got it.
[69:42.88]See?
[69:43.92]Everything's just fine.
[69:45.80]There it is.
[69:48.74]Don't worry about it.
[69:49.42]Everything's fine.
[69:52.42]That may have already been like that.
[69:53.46]I don't know.
[69:57.05]Which ear is this for?
[69:58.09]There's ear wax on it.
[70:05.13]That's not ear wax.
[70:06.99]There's a hair on it.
[70:09.42]Why do you say earwax, buddy?
[70:13.86]There's hair all over this though.
[70:15.12]That's like dog hair, that's not my hair.
[70:17.34]Let's try to reattach this.
[70:20.00]So it's this one, right?
[70:31.01]Why is there hair all over me?
[70:39.72]earbuds in your dog's ears no what no this is the wrong one all right good as new see
[71:08.35]This is supposed to be attached, but whatever.
[71:10.33]And it goes in here, and the jelly, I can just stuff it in there.
[71:14.33]We're fine.
[71:14.67]Everything's good.
[71:16.15]Looks like a hearing aid.
[71:28.38]Leave the cam on?
[71:29.18]I don't want to.
[71:31.85]I'm laughing at that it's funny Must be something I had
[72:02.94]Wow, I didn't know what that was until it was revealed, the curtain came open.
[72:08.88]Get to the candy store fast for free Jawbreakers.

[72:29.93]Do I have to do the edge jump?
[72:34.48]No, no, no, no.
[72:37.58]The jump.
[72:38.36]Wasn't this an episode?
[72:41.02]Was it?
[72:49.78]No, I have to jump on this.
[72:54.48]Oops.
[72:55.02]How am I not annoyed by the game?
[72:57.66]I don't know.
[73:04.36]Why the hell are you still playing this?
[73:06.34]I don't know!
[73:06.76]I don't know!
[73:07.48]I don't know!

[73:40.37]The door doesn't open.
[73:45.63]Break the door.

[79:30.33]It'd be so funny.
[79:31.47]What a stupid chant that would be.
[79:35.30]Well, it looks like he missed a shot in lane.
[79:38.86]That's too bad.
[79:40.30]Where's fucking Ed?
[79:46.42]Yeah, it looks like his, his uh, who's a League of Legends fucking character?
[79:50.84]Where's Ed?
[79:51.44]Where's Ed?
[79:56.05]I fell through the earth.
[80:18.27]He was under the map.
[80:22.01]Okay, well, let's try to go- I'm gonna do this one more time.
[80:24.87]Like, imagine- Wait, let's go over that again.
[80:33.12]So, there's like a big eSports event.
[80:37.60]And one of the teams, you know, a counter-strike or whatever, and some guy misses a very important shot, and you can see him like, visibly like, pissed off.
[80:44.91]commentators are like man he really is not happy about that missing that last shot and the whole stadium is just like mad because bad mad because bad mad because bad I think that'd be like funny get up no don't that would be so rude
[81:11.13]I know.
[81:12.23]Oh, you don't... What's that again?
[81:13.87]Hold on, say that again?
[81:15.25]I'd like for you to say that in front of the whole class, please.
[81:18.40]Huh.
[81:18.96]Interesting.
[81:19.36]That would be what?
[81:20.82]What would that be?
[81:23.54]Rude.
[81:24.90]It'd be very rude, wouldn't it?
[81:27.14]Oh.
[81:28.16]Interesting.
[81:30.00]You just fell right for my fucking trap.
[81:46.86]All of a sudden, it's rude!
[81:49.98]Whoa!
[81:50.90]Alright, come on, come on, here goes!
[82:07.32]I tried to catch it!
[82:11.88]I can't take this anymore!
[82:22.28]Can I just, like, strategically give commands to say, like, hey, Ed, you stay over there and patrol.
[82:29.04]Next, next, just wait, I gotta do this one more time.
[82:31.92]Hey, Lou, how are you?
[82:34.81]Hey!
[82:35.91]Hey, Lou, how are you?
[82:39.01]Hey!
[82:49.72]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[82:51.18]Got it.
[82:51.82]Look, Sarah.
[82:54.22]Left the table.
[82:56.30]What?
[82:56.50]What was I supposed to do about that?
[82:59.23]What would that do for us?
[83:22.28]Push Sarah?
[83:24.30]You sure?
[83:27.90]I'm not sure that... I mean... Push Sarah or Ehe Luhala Hey?
[83:32.59]Which one do you think?
[83:34.23]Nah, that was good.
[83:44.17]That was a good idea to do.
[83:45.39]Ehe Luhala Hey.
[83:48.11]Thanks for the tip, guys.
[83:54.19]This game's driving me insane, man.
[84:02.89]Chat, insane.
[84:04.01]Why is everybody driving me driving insane?
[84:06.19]We're gonna go off the jump?
[84:11.90]Insane.
[84:24.96]There's a reason why I wouldn't be invited to an esports event as a caster or something.
[84:28.24]I would stand up and try to get them to do the Ed laugh.
[84:31.59]I'd be like, oh yeah, that's really interesting what's going on on screen.
[84:33.97]That was a full penta kill, I guess.
[84:36.45]But hey, can everybody in the audience do your best Eddie laugh?
[84:41.30]I would be removed.
[84:55.70]Now, what am I supposed to do?
[84:57.30]Switch to Ed?
[84:59.45]Can Ed do something about the door?
[85:01.93]Everyone complete.
[85:02.95]Fringe.
[85:07.63]Yeah?
[85:08.95]Is that what happened?
[85:15.30]Nothing else over here?
[85:16.16]Can I break that?
[85:24.86]I don't think so.
[85:29.00]Oh, there's a... over here.
[85:35.21]I'm begging you, everybody's so upset right now.
[85:38.39]Jump over it?
[85:39.45]Stand tall?
[85:49.75]The springboard move?
[85:52.27]No.
[85:52.53]I have to move something over there?
[85:57.57]The jump?
[85:58.03]Maybe the jump?
[86:03.80]Hmm.
[86:04.24]Oh, wait.
[86:18.81]Nice.
[86:19.17]Alright, now we have to go like this.
[86:20.39]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[86:52.17]This is torture.
[86:55.41]I'll give you torture.
[86:56.78]You want me to try to do no for five straight minutes?
[87:01.34]I'm gonna hit that.
[87:12.04]Nice.
[87:15.18]Of course we do.
[87:15.98]No you don't.
[87:16.38]You really don't want that.
[87:25.70]Look, I want to leave this game, but I can't.
[87:32.87]This is back when licensed video games existed and were fun.
[87:42.04]Do I have to do the planks still?
[87:43.10]Yeah.
[87:54.71]They don't make licensed video games anymore, and if they do, they're like accidental games.
[88:02.40]Somebody just accidentally made the whole thing.
[88:04.08]Alright, we're getting there.
[88:08.64]Let me just get to the candy store, and then I'll stop.
[88:14.84]Spider-Man?
[88:16.56]Yeah, but Spider- Hold on.
[88:18.02]There's a difference.
[88:18.64]Look.
[88:19.38]Batman, Arkham, the Arkham games are amazing.
[88:22.00]Spider-Man is amazing.
[88:23.72]But those... I'm talking about, like, cartoons or TV shows.
[88:29.60]Batman isn't solely a TV show.
[88:32.48]Batman is an entire franchise of media.
[88:36.29]He's everything.
[88:37.55]Ed, Edd n' Eddy is just Ed, Edd n' Eddy.
[88:44.26]Let's break this with Ed, right?
[88:51.88]Tease everything, yeah.
[88:56.57]Ooh!
[88:58.65]God, that kind of hurt my head.
[89:00.83]Ed and Eddie had movies?
[89:04.89]No, but they were cartoon network movies.
[89:15.19]They didn't get a proper theatrical movie.
[89:23.93]No, I know.
[89:25.32]They had like a made-for-TV movie.
[89:31.24]I'm hurting them.
[89:32.66]Alright, we're almost done.
[89:35.86]Okay.
[89:45.19]I saw it at opening night.
[89:47.39]This movie doesn't exist.
[89:56.16]Chicken!
[90:07.25]You aren't allowed to do a lame stream after a day off.
[90:13.27]What?
[90:17.25]Hey, it's for me to decide what stream I'm going to do and when I'm going to do it.
[90:21.43]I'm not allowed to do a stream of a game that I want to play?
[90:25.53]What, have you lost your mind?
[90:47.65]Report him to Twitch.
[90:49.51]He's playing Ed, Edd n Eddy for an hour and ten minutes.
[90:53.39]Report him!
[90:57.67]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[90:58.29]You just took a day off.
[91:00.33]You can't play Ed, Edd n Eddy!
[91:01.87]How dare you!
[91:07.82]Oh look, there's a water thing over there.
[91:11.30]Can I go in there?
[91:23.50]You're not allowed.
[91:29.59]I know you're just kidding, but like still.
[91:31.89]Come on.
[91:44.33]Okay, I'm just single Ed right now.
[91:46.79]Here we go.
[91:47.43]Wait!
[91:48.15]No!
[91:49.23]Thank you!
[91:51.87]Thank you!
[92:16.72]Forcing people to watch something literally counts as torture.
[92:19.83]Why am I forcing you to be here?
[92:26.77]That's like, okay, you're sitting in the torture chamber.
[92:30.01]Your arms aren't tied down.
[92:31.97]I got like a drill and I'm like, I'm ready to fucking torture you.
[92:35.44]Your arms aren't tied.
[92:36.76]There's an exit sign with the door open.
[92:38.98]And there's a sign that says, welcome to the torture chamber.
[92:42.26]By the way, at any moment during the procedure, you can get up and leave.
[92:46.36]You can just walk out.
[92:48.60]I can't believe he's torturing me.
[92:55.78]You can leave the torture room.
[92:58.63]It's just open.
[93:00.35]It's still torture.
[93:01.23]No, it's not.
[93:02.29]No, it's not!
[93:05.23]Why do you have a drill?
[93:06.71]It's a fucking metaphor.
[93:28.82]No, but that's the thing.
[93:30.06]I've... Okay.
[93:31.88]I have a room set up that says, this is a torture chamber.
[93:36.11]When you come in here, you're gonna get tortured.
[93:38.65]And you walk in.
[93:39.33]Whoa, this is interesting.
[93:40.45]On my, like, fucking Disney trip.
[93:41.97]Whoa, I didn't know they had one of these.
[93:43.93]There's a chair.
[93:44.53]It's an open chair.
[93:45.19]It says, by the way, sitting in this chair, you're gonna get tortured.
[93:48.41]Really?
[93:49.05]And it's like, for real.
[93:50.41]And you sit down on this thing.
[93:51.64]This thing's pretty comfortable.
[93:53.68]I come in.
[93:55.73]And I say, excuse me, sir, I just want to make sure I understand.
[93:57.65]Like, you're going to be tortured.
[94:00.13]No, I don't think I want that.
[94:02.06]Okay, but you can leave the exhibit.
[94:04.10]No.
[94:05.50]Do you want to get tortured?
[94:06.36]No.
[94:07.48]Do you want to leave the exhibit?
[94:08.56]No.
[94:08.64]Well, this is what we do here.
[94:11.01]No.
[94:18.99]He's admitting the game sucks.
[94:20.76]No, I'm not.
[94:21.46]This game's fun.
[94:23.08]I wouldn't be playing it for like an hour.
[94:24.44]Alright, you know what?
[94:26.82]Well, if it isn't dork, dork, and dork.
[94:29.71]Next torture game, please.
[94:31.31]Oh, great.
[94:32.83]Ladies and gentlemen, Shovel Chin.
[94:35.99]Can it, dork.
[94:37.19]Let's see how cool you really are.
[94:39.77]Oh, I stuck my tongue in a bathtub drain once.
[94:42.88]Yeah, Kevin has a really, like, big chin in this game.
[94:45.36]Pick it up and throw it at these trash cans behind me.
[94:48.42]Knock them down and I'll let you pass.
[94:50.66]If not, you losers won't be going anywhere.
[94:53.91]Ha ha!
[95:00.83]Alright, I gotta... I have a timer for this mission.
[95:05.41]In the trash can.
[95:08.79]Timer on the clock.
[95:12.44]Fuck.
[95:16.10]I gotta get knocked up down.
[95:18.32]What was I supposed to do?
[95:24.50]Yeah, this has physics in it.
[95:26.14]Oh, fuck.
[95:35.75]I didn't listen.
[95:36.63]I'm too busy torturing people!
[95:38.31]I have to throw them in?
[95:43.49]Or just knock them off?
[95:50.23]I think it's just knock them off.
[96:01.10]Alright, line it up.
[96:02.05]I still have time.
[96:08.79]Oh, fuck.
[96:10.23]I just put one back up there.
[96:11.41]Uh-oh.
[96:16.29]Uh-oh.
[96:23.64]Las Vegas.
[96:24.60]Shut up!
[96:26.14]Hey, shut up!
[96:38.31]Alright, once I get through this section, I'm gonna take a piss.
[96:46.14]And we'll change games.
[96:48.90]Yeah.
[96:49.22]Yeah, I did it.
[96:50.50]Las Vegas will never have an NBA team.
[96:52.36]How dare you say that to me?
[97:19.13]How dare you say that?
[97:25.52]I mean, there's like messing around, there's like joking around, and then they're saying something so reprehensible that I can't even believe it.
[97:39.55]We've got hockey, we've got baseball on the way, we've got football on the way, and they're not gonna be an NBA team?
[97:45.19]How dare you?
[97:47.90]Oh my god, no!
[97:48.26]Come on, get it!
[97:56.44]Fuck.
[98:00.08]No, this is harder than it looks.
[98:01.44]That was good.
[98:16.17]Throw the cans?
[98:16.95]He said basketballs.
[98:17.83]I have to play by the rules.
[98:18.79]He didn't say throw the cans.
[98:25.31]He said throw the basketball.
[98:30.68]That was almost a strike.
[98:32.26]I'll get it.
[98:36.28]Come on!
[98:37.00]Ooh!
[98:38.98]Do it legit.
[98:41.62]Legit!
[98:42.02]Legit!
[98:42.36]Legit!
[98:42.66]Legit!
[98:42.92]Legit!
[98:43.20]Legit!
[98:43.40]Give me this basketball!
[98:44.12]Turn and throw it!
[98:49.40]Oh, yeah, baby.
[98:51.22]Legit.
[98:57.04]That's it.
[99:04.36]Bees!
[99:05.40]What do we do?
[99:07.14]We could probably... Bees?
[99:08.64]Oh, my God.
[99:09.12]Mel got ass.
[99:10.96]Hey, Melonhead!
[99:12.06]Hand over the honey!
[99:13.40]No way.
[99:14.48]It's Blank's turn right now.
[99:22.50]Get the beehives.
[99:23.14]No, no, no, no, no.
[99:30.24]Is that gonna... Okay, that doesn't count.
[99:31.34]We're good.
[99:31.58]That was really, like, mean and rude and bad.
[99:43.28]What?
[99:43.48]Did I pick a plank?
[99:45.26]Did I just kill Jimmy?
[99:46.74]Uh...
[100:02.74]He's allergic to bees.
[100:06.17]Is that shit?
[100:14.95]There's shit right here.
[100:24.93]Oh my God.
[100:29.70]Why is Jimmy not waking up?
[100:37.30]Oh my God.
[100:37.88]Just switch to a different character for the love of God.
[100:40.11]Get off me.
[100:45.01]No, he's still dead.
[100:50.38]This is kind of bad, I don't know what to do.
[100:54.73]He's getting swarmed by bees.
[101:08.85]Fuck.
[101:09.25]No, no, alright.
[101:16.87]I gotta pee bad.
[101:17.93]I can't believe you played two hours of Ed and Eddie the Misadventures.
[101:24.22]I don't believe it.
[101:31.58]Cat?
[101:31.88]No peeing allowed.
[101:35.23]No peeing allowed.
[101:47.67]Alright, one log at the bottom, one log at the top.
[101:50.12]Let me just, uh, Resident Evil slash Tank Controls Tomb Raider, get this selected.
[101:54.34]Oh, you fucking dummy.
[101:59.46]Here we go.
[102:01.26]Can I do it now?
[102:01.98]Oh, it goes this way.
[102:07.95]Bingo.
[102:18.45]I did another level.
[102:19.05]Gun.
[102:19.41]Gun.
[102:20.57]Done.
[102:20.89]Done.
[102:22.27]Done.
[102:23.67]He's allergic to jawbreakers?
[102:25.95]They're filled with powder.
[102:48.99]Got it.
[102:52.69]Alright, that's the third.
[102:53.53]That's strike three.
[102:57.64]That was fun.
[102:58.14]Look at that.
[103:12.33]Hide!
[103:13.05]Avoid being seen by the other kids.
[103:15.33]Hide in certain objects with Eddie, or hide behind poles in the Tower of Eddie.
[103:20.93]Let's see what happens when you get seen.
[103:24.60]Get by dog.
[103:26.20]That was... violent.
[103:27.62]It's a stealth mission.
[103:31.26]Yes.
[103:31.74]Wait, get in here.
[103:36.92]Really?
[103:38.60]Okay, these stupid fucking red squirrels.
[103:44.06]He's still gone.
[103:44.78]No, I'm almost done.
[103:46.14]Did this come up before Metal Gear?
[103:49.44]Or is this a Metal Gear reference?
[103:50.88]Really?
[103:51.28]How do I sneak by the dog, then?
[103:56.62]It's an actual stealth mission past the dog.
[104:14.03]Sick.
[104:15.24]Sick.
[104:15.92]Oh, it's Jenny.
[104:43.51]Can I de-use this on him?
[104:48.57]Go!
[104:52.95]Nice!
[104:56.91]Surrounded by squirrels, just go by.
[105:09.48]Nice!
[105:12.08]Why is that camera doing this?
[105:14.94]Almost there.
[105:15.75]Painting.
[105:17.33]Go buy the painting.
[105:19.09]Who saw me?
[105:20.43]What?
[105:41.52]I didn't even get a chance.
[105:42.32]What?
[105:42.52]How am I supposed to even do that?
[105:45.02]How am I supposed to go over there?
[105:46.80]There.
[105:47.42]How am I supposed to go over there?
[105:53.29]There.
[105:53.47]There.
[105:53.61]There.
[106:08.72]That's a perfect hit.
[106:10.28]What?
[106:10.90]I think I'm gonna be sick.
[106:15.14]Will he come over and investigate the noise?
[106:18.48]You know what I'm saying?
[106:20.48]Like... Is he like, oh, what was that noise?
[106:29.37]Oh.
[106:40.12]Okay.
[106:42.58]Yeah, that was just a briefcase from Hitman.
[106:45.92]Easy.
[106:47.85]Alright, we got one more, uh, what's... I don't know what they're doing over there.
[107:02.14]That's weird.
[107:02.66]Okay, so I gotta sneak by.
[107:04.40]Throw a trash can, maybe?
[107:06.92]Hide in the bush?
[107:12.21]Or Ed jump up here?
[107:13.21]No.
[107:14.99]No.
[107:15.49]Come on.
[107:16.35]Ed jump.
[107:16.85]No.
[107:16.95]The tower?
[107:17.53]Can I do anything about that?
[107:19.47]No.
[107:41.67]Well, let's just... Done.
[107:53.14]And a Jawbreaker.
[107:55.56]I'm glad Jerma's having fun, because I'm not.
[108:00.02]We're almost done.
[108:01.00]I just have to move around.
[108:01.96]It's the puke.
[108:02.64]The fake puke that you get in the comedy thing.
[108:06.72]That's it, right?
[108:21.06]What?
[108:25.53]Oh.
[108:26.67]Come on!
[108:27.99]Oops.
[108:37.87]Perfect shot.
[108:41.02]Oh, you dumb game.
[108:42.52]I get it.
[108:48.63]Gotta hit him again.
[108:54.89]Bingo.
[108:55.37]No?
[108:56.19]Come on, what in the name of God?
[108:57.71]What in the name of God?
[109:01.50]He's gonna pee his pants?
[109:03.06]You're right.
[109:03.42]I gotta be careful.
[109:15.01]How did that not connect?
[109:16.69]Can I like move this?
[109:21.43]Yes, I can.
[109:24.18]Just hide behind it, right?
[109:30.90]Stay with me.
[109:41.53]Oh!
[109:42.29]I did it.
[109:43.89]Scan number three must be something I ate.
[109:47.51]You didn't think I was going to do three missions out of this game.
[109:53.65]We made it!
[109:54.88]Man, that was a close one.
[110:00.96]Hey, dork!
[110:02.06]Say cheese!
[110:06.38]Halfway done with the campaign.
[110:17.43]Finish this game because I never did.
[110:20.69]No, that was fun.
[110:24.13]Oh, by the way, everyone that's, uh, I forgot, that's my lie.
[110:29.04]My lie did not work out so well.
[110:31.62]Would I tell you this was like a $40 game?
[110:35.08]Somebody would have zoomed in on that.
[110:36.10]I said it was $79 or something, right?
[110:45.91]All right, let me pass up here back.
[110:47.39]We're going to move on to another one.
[110:50.88]I'll see you in a minute.
[110:53.52]We'll keep the Ed, Edd n Eddy music on.
[111:20.41]so so
[111:52.01]Yeah.
[111:52.75]Yeah.
[112:21.57]Thank you.
[112:48.96]All right.
[112:50.66]So next up on the list, I don't know if I want to do that one yet.
[113:17.21]I'm gonna have to save that one for tomorrow.
[113:20.09]Oh, this is gonna be tough.
[113:21.65]How are any of these gonna live up to Ed, Edd n Eddy the Misadventures?
[113:26.58]This one looks like it could be kinda fun.
[113:33.32]This is called Motocross Mania 3.
[113:37.02]Crazed riders have turned motocross racing into an intense bloodsport where survival in the name of the game.
[113:42.85]Unleash the mania in ferocious high-speed hand-to-hand combat.
[113:48.59]So you drive around, you get like bats, and you can throw people off their bikes.
[113:54.24]Who knows?
[113:57.16]Never heard of it.
[113:59.44]That sounds too cool to be true.
[114:02.48]You're going to have to believe it.
[114:04.40]Those of you that enjoyed that, I did too.
[114:12.04]Wasn't a stinker like some people would tell you.
[114:20.37]This is Motocross Mania 3.
[114:22.31]I'm looking forward to this one.
[114:31.22]And why don't we just bring you guys back?
[114:34.20]What do you say?
[114:38.76]I keep thinking of that bad biker game.
[114:42.72]Road?
[114:43.04]Was it Road Rash?
[114:47.01]It's probably a Road Rash clone.
[114:49.80]But I just saw the front cover and I had to get it.
[114:55.34]This used to be an Ed, Edd, and Eddy stream.
[114:59.38]Yes, it did.
[115:00.12]And now it's a Motocross Mania stream.
[115:02.82]Caution.
[115:03.89]There's an autosave.
[115:04.79]Good.
[115:09.85]2K Games.
[115:10.77]2K made this?
[115:20.95]I didn't hear the noise.
[115:21.63]Can you restart the console, please?
[115:25.60]This is a horrible thing to look at.
[115:29.34]Oh my god, this hurts.
[115:31.52]Stop, stop.
[115:32.64]Stop it.
[115:41.10]Was that- hold on, was that lady naked?
[115:44.09]What?
[115:44.35]Hold on a minute.
[115:45.09]Wait a minute.
[115:47.11]This is Ray T, right?
[115:49.84]This is tea.
[115:51.06]That was weird.
[115:51.98]This game is going to be... I can't... I don't want to see anymore.
[116:01.47]That was actually somebody naked, I think.
[116:08.35]Saving some data.
[116:14.84]Create profile.
[116:16.83]Enter your name.
[116:17.53]A, A, A. How about, I got one for you.
[116:20.35]E. Ed.

[116:45.10]Let's just do, um... Championship.
[116:49.40]New game.
[116:51.44]Difficulty, I'm a wimp.
[116:54.30]Finished in the top four to advance.
[116:59.10]Challenging.
[116:59.79]Finished in the top three to advance.
[117:04.59]We're gonna go with standard Mario Kart rules, guys, okay?
[117:11.75]Jesus.
[117:21.43]All leg.
[117:27.38]Aggression.
[117:29.96]We need the most aggressive.
[117:31.36]We need high aggression speed jumping?
[117:38.75]Pretty balanced.
[117:39.39]This one's locked.
[117:43.17]Locked.
[117:46.59]Locked.
[117:49.79]There's unlockable characters, somehow.
[117:51.85]Is that a robot?
[117:58.34]Is that... is that Bigfoot?
[118:06.42]Aggression... who... okay, the highest aggression.
[118:10.58]What about the highest fighting?
[118:12.98]Fighting is important.
[118:22.22]I think the balanced... I think Karen is probably the most balanced here.
[118:26.10]Fighting, speed, jumping... The thrill of riding a bike and reading a book.
[118:38.17]Yeah, Leticia does have full aggression.
[118:41.09]Alright, yeah, I mean...
[118:54.73]Let's kick the shit out of some people.
[119:05.51]How do I play?
[119:07.15]Do I get a tutorial?
[119:07.91]Alright, X is... It's X. Standings.
[119:16.86]Next race, Woodland Riot B. So, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
[119:24.15]You've been challenged.
[119:31.41]You accept the challenge.
[119:32.53]I don't know.
[119:32.97]What does that even mean?
[119:35.73]The sentence you just told me, I don't know what that means in the context of racing on a motorcycle.
[119:46.80]How do I do anything?
[119:54.03]You can spin around on the bike?
[119:59.19]Is there any of the moves I can do?
[120:08.77]Alright, there she goes.
[120:11.29]Who's the challenge for?
[120:12.83]Wait, okay, R1.
[120:13.39]R1 and L1.
[120:22.25]Everybody just did the same thing.
[120:24.03]I'm not stupid.
[120:24.89]Everybody did that.
[120:28.48]Why is there no music?
[120:29.46]I don't know.
[120:29.86]What about R2, L2?
[120:33.16]What?
[120:36.18]What happened there?
[120:39.65]How am I in fifth place?
[120:53.44]Mania?
[120:53.82]I gotta get up there.
[121:06.86]I tried to do it!
[121:07.58]Okay, circle is trick.
[121:09.90]So don't do tricks.
[121:12.38]Nobody else fell off.
[121:15.52]Good.
[121:16.00]Almost there.
[121:17.68]Holy shit, that guy just did like a blender move.
[121:22.30]I killed that guy good.
[121:24.28]First place.
[121:27.91]We're like triangle.
[121:31.05]Anything else?
[121:32.31]Why did this?
[121:33.03]What happened?
[121:33.61]I don't understand.
[121:34.51]Why did I come?
[121:35.31]This asshole just fucking blew up in front of me.
[122:06.42]You don't deserve to win this.
[122:14.21]Okay, I've made $500.
[122:17.81]1063.
[122:18.55]I unlocked parking at B. You take a day off and you play this shit.
[122:30.42]All right, so we have auto shop garage, next race.
[122:44.57]Quick game.
[122:48.18]What about, like, Auto Shop?
[122:52.00]Turn the sound down.
[122:56.30]Weapons.
[122:59.10]Bear paw.
[123:02.58]Cattle prod.
[123:04.88]What is a china staff?
[123:06.54]I don't understand what that means.
[123:08.54]Flower staff.
[123:09.90]Hockey stick.
[123:11.64]Ice pick.
[123:13.50]Scepter.
[123:17.36]Crowbar.
[123:18.40]Golf club.
[123:22.96]Ice club?
[123:26.16]Can you throw tomahawks?
[123:29.79]What's the difference?
[123:30.77]Used gold rose.
[123:32.03]Well, I don't know why, how do you, isn't a rose just a rose?
[123:39.51]Let's get the ice pick.
[123:44.00]Okay, that's it.
[123:44.64]I got it, apparently.
[123:48.29]Now how do you use a rose?
[123:58.32]That's an odd wording there.
[123:59.40]Alright, next race.
[124:11.75]You can go back.
[124:13.51]Ow.
[124:13.69]Alright, championship.
[124:17.84]New game.
[124:18.24]What do you mean, new game?
[124:19.02]Did I just do quit?
[124:22.25]I went to quit.
[124:26.59]Oh, god damn it.
[124:28.79]Whatever.
[124:29.29]Okay, here we are.
[124:34.04]Game manager.
[124:37.38]This one.
[124:45.60]I mean, it is a little blurry.
[124:46.76]Give me some credit.
[124:48.88]See, next race.
[124:49.64]There it is.
[124:50.02]Alright, let's get in first place.
[125:02.91]I got my new weapon, right?
[125:11.51]Stage two out of seven.
[125:12.69]I'm gonna beat this game.
[125:18.69]Ready?
[125:20.11]Go!
[125:20.45]Ice pick is pretty deadly.
[125:36.03]Oh no no no, don't get in front of me.
[125:44.28]Don't drop into a tree.
[125:53.25]Did I miss money?
[125:57.63]Final lap!
[126:00.11]Did I not go through it?
[126:01.11]Why is it doing that?
[126:01.95]What?
[126:02.33]Why is it pointing that way?
[126:03.25]What are you doing?
[126:04.15]What?
[126:04.68]Oh, it's sixth place!
[126:11.52]You have to drive through these.
[126:14.76]It's not just an indicator of the race, you have to actually go through them.
[126:31.51]I got it.
[126:35.20]I win.
[126:35.56]The volume, for the love of God.
[126:43.66]I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
[126:45.46]I hope you have Midnight Club 2 or 3.
[126:58.19]I do not.
[126:58.55]I do not.
[127:03.72]There are some secret ones here.
[127:16.16]Fuck you.
[127:18.12]What?
[127:19.46]There are so many PlayStation 2 games.
[127:20.98]I got all of them.
[127:23.44]Alright, no, no, no.
[127:24.03]What about armor?
[127:26.95]Armor.
[127:31.51]Okay.
[127:32.35]Bike parts.
[127:35.12]A new engine.
[127:36.06]How about new tires?
[127:37.14]Sure.
[127:38.38]How about some new brakes?
[127:41.13]OK.
[127:49.50]Don't do that.
[127:57.73]Alright, this is the last race I'm gonna do, and then this one's kind of... It really is just like... It's really one thing you do, and that's this.
[128:11.26]Dropped viewers after Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[128:14.47]Yeah, well, come on.
[128:19.03]Two hours to do what?
[128:26.89]Oh, you just kill each other.
[128:36.64]Got it.
[128:43.69]Is he kidding me with his feet?
[128:49.59]This game is fucking stupid.
[128:58.62]We both try to do the same thing.
[129:03.82]Alright, that's two takedowns.
[129:05.10]I got three.
[129:09.52]New weapon.
[129:11.32]One more minute.
[129:21.47]This is god-awful, somebody said.
[129:23.75]Let me just at least get to first place.
[129:31.48]Where is everybody?
[129:32.74]Oh, they're in the corner over here.
[129:40.61]I'm in first.
[129:41.25]I got to stay in first place, though.
[129:52.27]Come on.
[129:52.85]Don't lose this.
[129:53.67]I got one.
[129:59.03]Good.
[129:59.85]Medium.
[130:06.12]Fifteen seconds and then I'm done.
[130:15.85]Kill steal.
[130:19.67]How did this get the third game?
[130:21.97]Probably because all the games are probably the same game.
[130:25.08]And they probably just released it three times.
[130:37.60]that was motocross mania 3. oh you guys are going to like this one that was quick that was really quick all right let's see what my hand goes here I'm hovering over
[131:03.33]I'm hovering right now over Family Feud or Stuntman.
[131:10.05]It's gonna be, this is a tough call.
[131:26.18]I mean, we're gonna do them both.
[131:30.06]The return of the bumps.
[131:37.73]I'll throw Family Feud in here.
[131:41.35]Blue Feud first.
[131:48.19]That was Motocross, uh, I don't even know what it's called.
[131:50.13]Something about, something Motocross, oh god, I'm sorry about your face.
[132:00.07]Sorry, I just, I just, I got, I got blue in your face.
[132:03.45]Didn't mean to, like, blind you there.
[132:07.75]So there's a very real possibility that this is just a game that we've already played on P, just on the console.
[132:23.88]I don't think it is though.
[132:24.92]This looks like a different version.
[132:32.44]I can't tell because there's no host on the back.
[132:38.29]The last one was Louis Anderson, right?
[132:47.98]What the fuck was that?
[132:48.92]Alright, here we go.
[132:57.32]Global Star Software.
[133:05.15]Atomic Planet.
[133:07.98]Oh my god, Munkahash!
[133:16.62]No Family Feud save file has been detected.
[133:19.34]Make one.
[133:27.56]Eight megabytes.
[133:28.54]Yeah.
[133:35.33]Is it the same one?
[133:36.71]Who's the host?
[133:42.30]Is it Louie Anderson?
[133:43.26]It's Louie?
[133:48.50]No, it's not!
[133:52.95]Who the hell is this guy?
[133:57.79]This is Mitt Romney.
[134:02.63]Did Mitt Romney host Family Feud?
[134:08.83]Alright, family editor, we gotta make, uh, family.
[134:11.18]Create or edit family.
[134:13.66]New family.
[134:19.64]This used to be a Louie stream.
[134:22.02]It did.
[134:25.54]Okay, we got, uh, enter family name.
[134:28.46]I don't know if the bumps could make a return here, because this is a new generation.
[134:39.22]The Albertsons.
[134:43.70]Make Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[134:46.46]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[134:48.24]Sorry, guys.
[134:56.05]Don't.
[134:56.93]Don't tell me to do that.
[135:02.65]What's their last name?
[135:07.92]Is it just the Edds?
[135:20.51]Okay, family name.
[135:21.17]The Eds.
[135:21.75]Member A. What?
[135:29.96]What?
[135:33.12]Okay.
[135:35.78]So we need Ed?
[135:41.43]Uh, we need somebody that looks like... Which one's Ed?
[135:52.08]Build A. You can have, like, a big stomach.
[135:56.74]Ed's the tall one, right?
[135:57.72]Alright, no, uh... Okay, hair color.
[136:06.59]What color is his hair?
[136:13.33]No beard.
[136:22.11]He has a kind of a goofy body, right?
[136:31.00]That's fine, okay.
[136:31.88]Alright, that's good.
[136:41.08]Add clothing.
[136:41.92]What does he have, clothes?
[136:43.94]He has like, this kind of, this actually looks pretty correct.
[136:50.02]That's pretty close already.
[136:59.25]I need uh, what the fuck, let's see.
[137:06.11]Let me get like an image of him.
[137:09.27]Okay, so green.
[137:10.05]Let's get like a green jacket on.
[137:12.27]That's as close as I can get it.
[137:17.94]And then like blue, right?
[137:29.01]Belt color.
[137:29.53]He didn't have a belt, but whatever.
[137:32.55]No glasses.
[137:33.21]Okay.
[137:40.98]Let's make sure there's not another one.
[137:47.54]No, that's good.
[137:50.04]And then we got here, this is... Why am I even doing this?
[138:02.85]It's already close.
[138:04.27]Does Ed have glasses?
[138:11.47]Can I put a hat on him?
[138:23.74]Which one looks the most like his head?
[138:28.22]Probably the one that was already on, like this one.
[138:37.15]Does Ed have a soul patch?
[138:45.44]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[138:46.40]Back it up.
[138:51.04]No, what?
[138:52.00]Why?
[138:52.74]I didn't do that.
[138:54.18]When did this happen?
[138:55.88]When did this happen?
[138:59.20]What?
[138:59.52]I didn't select any of that.
[139:17.49]We need to get the glasses out of there.
[139:23.13]Which one was it?
[139:23.67]It was like this one, right?
[139:26.51]Edit clothing.
[139:28.80]Top style.
[139:29.84]It's an orange shirt.
[139:30.92]There we go.
[139:35.98]How does it look?
[139:39.79]Just need a straight up t-shirt.
[139:43.75]That's as good as it's gonna get.
[139:45.11]Bottom is purple shorts.
[139:52.94]There's no purple shorts.
[139:58.36]What do you mean red?
[139:59.92]Red?!

[147:25.65]Random.
[147:26.27]Let's create a random family.
[147:27.59]Choose opposing family skill level.
[147:29.58]Average.
[147:29.90]Alright.
[147:34.08]This is what you've been waiting for.
[147:43.66]Get ready for action.
[147:45.78]It's time for...
[147:49.05]The Mills vs. The Eds.
[147:57.65]My sons!
[147:59.08]Ed, Edd, and Eddy!
[148:04.42]Why are you addicted to Family Feud?
[148:05.48]I just am.
[148:05.68]Okay.
[148:05.78]This is the same person.
[148:16.53]It's all about speed here.
[148:18.31]Buzz in and give me an answer as fast as you can.
[148:21.35]But if it's not the top answer, then the other family will get a chance to answer as well.
[148:25.95]Are you guys Edds, too?
[148:27.67]Did you make Edds?
[148:28.59]All right.
[148:29.25]Good luck, you guys.
[148:30.61]We've surveyed 100 people.
[148:32.49]The top answers are on the board.
[148:34.66]Give me the most popular answer.
[148:36.40]I know how to play.
[148:37.42]Something you might need a ladder to clean.
[148:39.82]How do I buzz?
[148:40.88]What?
[148:41.28]That's something that any would do.
[148:43.26]Oh, come on.
[148:43.64]Impact.
[148:43.90]Might need a ladder to clean.
[149:06.41]What do I need to clean with a ladder?
[149:09.44]Thinking time.
[149:12.24]That's not enough time.
[149:13.92]The attic?
[149:19.92]The survey says... Why did it stop in five seconds?
[149:26.44]There are six answers left on the board.
[149:28.92]I can't believe we screwed it up.
[149:30.00]We wanted you to name...
[149:34.07]Something you might need a ladder to clean.
[149:36.08]What do you think, Eddie?
[149:37.58]Is that Eddie?
[149:40.02]You have gutters.
[149:48.15]Okay, so I understand.
[149:49.21]You have 10 seconds to start.
[149:52.49]Surely that's going to be the top answer.
[149:55.45]That's a good answer, but what does the survey say?
[149:58.91]Goddard is number one, number two.
[150:00.29]What do you need a ladder to clean?
[150:02.41]Your shelf?
[150:03.77]On top of your fridge?
[150:06.69]You roof?
[150:12.17]A window.
[150:12.81]Your windows.
[150:18.29]I'm going to go with window, Mitt.
[150:22.28]Okay, let's see what it says.
[150:25.08]Let me see a window.
[150:25.76]Is it up there?
[150:31.16]53%.
[150:31.26]There are four answers still up on the board.
[150:36.67]I asked you to name something you might need a ladder to clean.
[150:40.41]We need a ladder to clean.
[150:41.31]Yeah, like a shelf.
[150:47.67]A shelf.
[150:48.71]A shelf.
[150:50.55]A shelf.
[150:55.22]A shelf.
[150:56.96]Something really high up.
[150:58.08]But what does the survey say?
[151:00.81]Yeah, there we go.
[151:04.82]It's so funny how they go from family member to family member.
[151:12.58]It's just me playing.
[151:16.12]What would you need a ladder to clean?
[151:19.20]A... Uh, the roof of your house.
[151:23.65]The roof.
[151:25.13]Get up on the roof.
[151:25.65]A dog.
[151:27.89]What do you mean a dog?
[151:32.01]Shit, I'm never gonna get these other ones.
[151:33.29]One person said something.
[151:34.41]There's one or two responses that was something just dumb.
[151:36.61]We need a ladder to clean.
[151:37.73]One person said.
[151:38.37]Ugh.
[151:38.49]Ceiling.
[152:00.94]Who cleans their ceiling?
[152:02.28]Like, wipe your ceiling.
[152:06.74]What do you need to clean the ceiling for?
[152:08.01]What?
[152:09.41]What do you need to... What's the one response?
[152:13.63]Ladder to clean.
[152:14.29]Ladder.
[152:14.67]Um... Uh... Um...
[152:30.96]Your car?
[152:32.24]Why would you need a ladder?
[152:33.94]No, you spray it with a hose.
[152:37.16]Clean your car with a ladder.
[152:38.52]What does the survey say?
[152:39.84]Alright, two strikes.
[152:45.58]Fuck.
[152:46.24]There's one answer still up on the board.
[152:49.41]One more strike and you'll lose control of the question.
[152:51.67]Nobody cleans there.
[152:53.09]Alright, you were asked to name...
[152:56.28]Your chimney?
[152:57.28]You don't put a ladder inside your fireplace and climb up your chimney.
[153:06.10]That's too... No!
[153:12.53]Um... God damn it.
[153:18.11]It's wrong, but I have to try.
[153:19.33]They're not gonna get it either.
[153:27.08]Alright, what is a Mills family?
[153:28.08]What did they say?
[153:28.76]What's their answer?
[153:30.66]They didn't even give an answer!
[153:31.90]Is that the point?
[153:34.06]Chandelier.
[153:56.66]Yeah, like the three people with a chandelier hanging in their house.
[154:05.85]No guess.
[154:07.17]I still, I won.
[154:07.77]Alright, how did I fuck this up last time?

[155:41.52]I'll take the points.
[155:48.07]Put it up there, Mitt.
[155:57.59]Maybe we should make them smarter.
[155:59.34]Uh, pants.
[155:59.58]Is the other family even trying?
[156:02.54]They haven't answered one question.
[156:28.36]Baggy underwear?
[156:29.54]I'm gonna pass it.
[156:32.34]I'm gonna pass it.
[156:33.31]Good luck.
[156:33.53]What else can you wear baggy?
[156:35.31]Shirt?
[156:35.87]Shirt!
[156:36.97]Yeah, you'll get that one.
[156:38.01]That's it though.
[156:38.61]Shirt, pants.
[156:52.57]You can't wear shoes baggy.
[156:54.31]Wearing shoes baggy is just wearing shoes that are like four sizes too big for you.
[156:58.63]You'd look ridiculous.
[157:00.17]You were asked to name an article of clothing people like to wear baggy.
[157:06.78]You've decided to pass.
[157:08.60]You're allowed to do that if you want.
[157:10.44]Pass.
[157:10.70]See, that's stupid.
[157:11.48]A baggy watch.
[157:11.92]I asked you to name...
[157:20.59]It would just fall off.
[157:25.07]Sweater.
[157:26.71]A baggy sweater.
[157:27.41]Isn't that a shirt?
[157:28.61]Isn't that the same thing as a shirt?
[157:34.35]They're not gonna get it.
[157:35.04]Shorts.
[157:35.26]That's pants.
[157:47.04]This is a little too... No.
[157:51.26]Pants are shorts.
[157:53.73]How are they not?
[157:54.35]A baggy hat.
[157:54.81]No.
[157:54.87]There's nothing else.
[157:55.55]Baggy jeans.
[157:55.85]Those are pants!
[157:57.67]If it's up there, I'm going to be fucking furious.
[157:59.89]You have pants up there three times.
[158:17.55]Pants, jeans, shorts.
[158:19.04]They're all pants.
[158:22.66]Anybody can still win this.
[158:24.54]It's not over until one family gets 300 points.
[158:27.94]They're now in the lead.
[158:33.56]Who will take two?
[158:34.82]I'm taking them.

[170:56.24]Princess.
[170:57.40]If it's not on the board, then you will lose control of the question.

[171:02.59]It has to be up there.
[171:03.09]It has to be number two.
[171:03.65]That was so good.
[171:06.83]Are the points safe or will some light fingers lift them?
[171:11.25]One correct answer and you get the points.
[171:15.24]Princesses get hired to come barney.

[192:56.58]Heart and Soul.
[192:57.22]Yep.
[193:25.83]You know how I know this?
[193:27.87]Because this is the song that I learned how to play when I was 11.
[193:34.31]That's a good answer, but what does the survey say?
[193:38.56]I can't even imagine how that's not on there.
[193:42.32]That's the song that, yeah, that's the song everyone learns to play.
[193:45.84]Everyone.
[193:47.80]The first song a kid learns how to play on the piano.

[195:06.03]Hot cross buns is the only one I can think of.
[195:08.31]There are four answers still up on the board.
[195:11.33]You've got two strikes.

[195:15.19]You were asked to name the first song a kid learns how to play on the piano.
[195:26.38]I'm never gonna beat this game.
[195:32.76]Hot cross buns.
[195:45.32]If it's not on the board, then you will lose control of the question.
[195:48.34]Hot cross buns.

[201:31.68]I don't know how it's possible to type all that in.
[201:34.02]Yes.
[201:34.18]Hey, thanks for the time.
[202:02.79]Shoulders.
[202:03.30]I would have said shoulders.
[202:05.72]A tuna.
[202:06.02]A salmon.
[202:06.42]Haddock.
[202:06.82]It doesn't matter what it is.
[202:08.04]I'll get it.
[202:30.09]Clear the board, please.
[202:31.35]How am I gonna do this?
[202:32.41]You need 107 points to win the big money.
[202:37.97]All right.
[202:38.23]Robin Hood.
[202:38.89]Yes, Peter Pan.
[202:39.49]Shakespeare.
[202:39.93]Okay, here we go.
[202:40.27]Superman?
[202:40.53]Superman?
[203:08.24]Peter Pan.
[203:08.92]A crime you think is easy to get away with.
[203:12.94]Loitering.
[203:22.51]Littering.
[203:37.47]Speedo.
[203:38.05]Shoulders.
[203:38.99]And tuna.
[203:39.31]Tuna or halibut.
[203:40.15]Haddock.
[203:47.47]Cod.
[203:47.61]Haddock.
[203:48.31]Halibut.
[204:12.55]You were asked to name a famous male who wears tights, real or fictional.
[204:17.69]One guy wrote halibut in the chat, and I don't know why I fucking listened to him.
[204:20.12]I was going to write tuna.
[204:28.80]We asked you to name a crime you think is easy to get away with.
[204:34.06]You chose... I mean, come on, littering is pretty easy to get away with.
[204:39.71]Survey says...
[204:42.75]Two L's.
[204:43.13]I mean, two T's.
[204:44.07]Oops.
[204:44.25]Speedo.
[204:44.57]That's pretty high.
[204:46.15]That's it?
[204:46.53]Shoulders.
[204:46.83]How's it gonna be?
[204:47.60]It's 60.
[204:47.84]Has to be number one answer.
[205:16.15]A fish a restaurant might feature as catch of the day.
[205:22.14]You said... It's not a halibut.
[205:29.80]It's like tuna, salmon.
[205:33.41]But we do give you $5 for every point you score.
[205:57.98]I don't wanna play that one anymore.
[205:58.98]That was Family Feud.
[206:09.91]Okay.
[206:13.11]Now, we're gonna move on.
[206:19.88]To Jaws.
[206:22.10]Jaws Unleashed.
[206:35.23]This game's crazy.
[206:38.07]But before we do that, I gotta pee again.
[206:41.03]I don't know what it is.
[206:43.50]Some nights, I'll have to pee once in nine hours.
[206:48.48]And then some nights, like tonight, I gotta pee every, like, 45 minutes.
[206:51.80]It's not like I'm doing anything different.
[207:01.45]I don't know why.
[207:01.87]It doesn't make any sense.
[207:08.99]Caffeine makes you pee?
[207:09.77]Yeah, I drink coffee pretty much every day, though.
[207:13.69]So there's a game that I don't know if I want to do today.
[207:16.74]We might just do- I might just do this whole thing tomorrow.
[207:20.12]And force myself to beat this game.
[207:23.10]This is a game that is timed, not this one.
[207:26.24]But tomorrow, I think I'm just gonna hate myself.
[207:30.12]And play this one.
[207:32.10]This is a PlayStation 2 game that you have 12 hours to beat the game.
[207:38.72]And I think it's going to be one of those Simpsons hit-and-run torture scenarios.
[207:45.79]There's a countdown.
[207:51.82]Dead Rising?
[207:52.60]No, not Dead Rising.
[207:54.08]It's called Without Warning.
[207:57.60]And apparently there is a clock that is 12 hours in the game or something.
[208:04.77]So, I'm going to leave that for tomorrow.
[208:07.63]Well, I don't know, maybe I'll... I've got a couple other great things to play, too.
[208:12.51]Yeah, see, look, ready?
[208:15.71]I'll just show it to you, just for fun.
[208:18.26]So this is it.
[208:18.90]It's an old Capcom game.
[208:23.08]See here?
[208:24.98]Without warning.
[208:27.48]Right?
[208:27.68]And if you look at the back, you have...
[208:40.47]See, no time for second chances.
[208:45.73]You have 12 hours to beat the game.
[208:52.88]What's fucking happening?
[208:54.02]I'm getting like killed.
[208:55.44]Did you just take down a whole building?
[209:14.31]Um, this is gonna be great.
[209:15.23]All right, be right back.
[209:16.74]I gotta pee.
[210:22.16]Ooh.
[210:26.17]Ooh.

[216:28.95]Welcome to Amity Island.
[216:30.77]This year promises to be better than ever.
[216:33.69]Seal Island continues to be a great attraction.
[216:35.91]That ball is hovering.
[216:36.41]Especially with a recent increase in its population.
[216:41.66]Oh, Jesus.
[216:42.96]And new partnerships with corporations such as Environ Plus will allow us to open our doors to even more visitors.
[216:51.00]Are they dropping, like, a bomb down here?
[216:52.88]What?
[217:00.01]How can you be that hungry?
[217:01.67]I don't understand sharks.
[217:04.57]They're always shown eating and devouring dozens and dozens of things.
[217:09.19]No one's that hungry.
[217:14.04]Steven Spielberg played the clarinet once on a beach.
[217:16.96]What information is that giving me?
[217:26.03]Steven Spielberg played first clarinet for one of the beach scenes.
[217:33.85]Oh.
[217:36.59]Okay.
[217:39.05]Press and hold X to swim.
[217:43.15]Discover all nine tutorial messages for a bonus.
[217:50.03]Can I attack?
[217:50.51]Like, the current is too strong.
[217:52.96]Okay.
[217:57.48]Press R1 to bite prey.
[217:59.38]Prey will appear on the sonar as yellow dots.
[218:03.28]When eating prey, your health... The red bar on the HUD will increase.
[218:08.10]So R1 is bite.
[218:09.92]Prey is red.
[218:11.72]And it increases health.
[218:14.42]That was... Poisonous?
[218:16.82]What was wrong with that?
[218:17.72]Okay.
[218:17.84]Can I eat a little goldfish?
[218:23.98]Yep.
[218:25.18]Now we gotta find more tutorial messages.
[218:31.09]Just keep swimming this way.
[218:32.05]I don't really need, uh... Is that a tutorial right here?
[218:38.15]What the hell is that?
[218:41.37]A license plate?
[218:44.01]Is this like a secret or something?
[218:54.34]Uh, okay.
[218:56.10]Eat it?
[218:56.36]I just... I was trying to.
[219:03.08]Alright, you've collected a license plate.
[219:04.94]There are a total of 45.
[219:07.69]Collect them all for a secret.
[219:09.29]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[219:10.07]These are seals?
[219:25.50]Press and hold R1 to bite and hold a victim in your mouth.
[219:31.16]Jesus.
[219:32.71]When holding a victim in your mouth, rapidly move the left stick and... left and right to tear them apart.
[219:49.64]Let's see what happens.
[219:57.74]This is terrible.
[220:08.21]I'm going to move on.
[220:08.94]I don't like that.
[220:09.82]I don't like ripping up otters.
[220:14.72]Hold down L1 to fill your charge attack meter.
[220:16.98]Release L1 in order to perform this move.
[220:18.96]You headbutt objects using this technique.
[220:22.45]Try it on the boat.
[220:23.45]You will earn points from destroying property.
[220:25.95]There's a person in this boat.
[220:36.89]And eat the guy, right?
[220:38.16]Oh, absolutely.
[220:38.88]Come here.
[220:51.40]Is he in my mouth still?
[220:57.25]That was fucking ridiculous.
[220:58.49]Okay.
[221:00.53]L2 is to charge your tail whip.
[221:02.43]Use it on this diver cage.
[221:09.31]He's still alive in there?
[221:13.70]Get him out!
[221:15.96]There he is.
[221:22.58]The sea seeker on the ocean floor is making you hungry.
[221:25.80]Destroy it to stop your hunger from being drained.
[221:29.30]If your hunger meter, which is the green bar, is completely drained, you will begin to lose health.
[221:34.37]So you have to eat.
[221:36.21]And that thing down there needs to be destroyed.
[221:41.00]There are other sharks fighting me right now.
[221:44.81]Come here, you little shit.
[221:48.53]Okay, eat the guy, eat the scuba diver.
[221:56.53]He ripped his leg off.
[221:57.75]Oh my god, that's terrible.
[222:00.96]Somehow he's still... Alright, I didn't do that.
[222:08.27]My other shark colleagues did that.
[222:10.07]I didn't.
[222:21.62]I'm gonna tail whip this guy.
[222:22.60]Can I tail whip his head off?
[222:25.46]Kind of.
[222:32.12]Did I catch him in midair?
[222:33.11]Alright, let's keep going.
[222:41.04]Points of interest such as the sunken ship appear as green squares on your sonar.
[222:48.64]Eat the diver in the cage.
[222:50.08]Main objectives appear as a red circle on your sonar.
[222:52.70]That wasn't a... I still got him.
[223:00.48]Alright, we gotta kill the diver.
[223:13.87]Oh, shit.
[223:14.83]Come here.
[223:20.21]Oh, you're in trouble.
[223:21.38]You're in trouble.
[223:25.84]It's a little wonky, but, you know, it's just the way it is.
[223:38.64]That was a lot of blood for one person.
[223:46.87]That was like 30 people worth of blood.
[223:54.78]Destroy that thing.
[223:55.80]Where the hell am I?
[224:08.04]Manually moving a camera is kind of annoying.
[224:10.56]And it's inverted.
[224:15.95]Is that not killing it?
[224:18.97]Oh, I got it.
[224:25.95]Should be it, right?
[224:29.55]So what's the red thing here?
[224:30.56]Oh, I gotta eat something.
[224:42.58]Come here, food.
[224:45.56]Let's go down, maybe?
[224:49.30]Is there somebody... like a diver in here?
[224:57.93]Or did I not eat the scuba diver?
[225:00.21]I heard a scream.
[225:06.83]This is the boat.
[225:07.81]Let's draw the boat.
[225:17.20]I'm gonna go over here.
[225:18.06]Let's just crash the boat.
[225:28.83]It's sinking, right?
[225:34.23]Gotta destroy the underwater robot thing.
[225:36.03]Oh, I thought I already did that.
[225:42.08]Apparently not.
[225:45.83]I thought I crossed it already.
[225:57.96]Author Peter Benchley was thrown off the set after objecting to the climax.
[226:08.09]Okay.
[226:14.79]Cool little tidbit.
[226:22.50]I was shown the objective in the cutscene.
[226:24.08]What do I do?
[226:24.78]Well, I've sat there for like two straight minutes trying to break the thing, and I thought I broke it.
[226:31.60]Swim by the beach to attack swimmers.
[226:33.62]To turn smart camera off, press R3.
[226:35.88]To enter first person, press R3 button once more.
[226:40.80]Okay.
[226:43.65]It's a first person mode.
[226:49.93]So, when a victim is on the surface, tap R2 to drag them under without being spotted.
[227:02.30]Oh my god, this is horrible.
[227:08.44]He's like puking up blood.
[227:11.99]Look what I got!
[227:18.95]Alright, now eat him!
[227:31.27]That's fucking terrible.
[227:36.52]You think you're safe?
[227:37.18]You think you're safe on the beach?
[227:45.90]Oh shit, I gotta get back in.
[227:53.04]The shark is gone.
[227:53.76]You can come back in.
[228:04.67]I'm trying.
[228:06.13]I gotta time it.
[228:11.69]That guy just fell down.
[228:23.53]No, I gotta go hide.
[228:24.11]I gotta go hide.
[228:24.57]Hide, hide.
[228:24.99]Just go hide.
[228:25.51]They'll come back.
[228:34.04]Use the laser beams on your head.
[228:36.58]She works.
[228:36.94]This way.
[228:58.97]Uh, how do I kill these people?
[229:00.67]Alright, let's reset.
[229:05.81]Back here.
[229:11.67]Do they still see me?
[229:12.31]Go in the water.
[229:14.35]I'm now stealthed.
[229:17.04]That scream.
[229:30.57]Just eat the turtle.
[229:31.81]Come here!
[229:37.54]Alright, well let's just keep going.
[229:52.17]There's a boat right here.
[229:54.87]Can I crush the boat?
[229:59.43]I can.
[230:02.00]Any people on this boat?
[230:02.90]No.
[230:06.02]Get the seals.
[230:14.43]Wait, what's this?
[230:15.25]License plate?
[230:16.09]I got a thousand points for that.
[230:27.08]Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat!
[230:33.25]Ugh, itchy face.
[230:37.27]You actually level up in this game?
[230:38.65]Can I even just jump up there?
[230:51.68]I kind of can.
[230:52.42]I feel like I already blew this, though.
[231:00.34]Let me go this way.
[231:08.89]No, maybe not.
[231:10.67]I'm on an invisible wall.
[231:15.72]Well, I'm not certain what I need to do.
[231:17.98]Maybe I have to just restart.
[231:35.22]Holy shit.
[231:36.84]Okay, that's cool.
[231:39.32]Restore checkpoint, maybe?
[231:44.21]What is the latest checkpoint?
[231:50.05]This is not the beginning of the game, is it?
[231:51.97]What the hell?
[232:06.06]Destroy the piers?
[232:08.50]Okay.
[232:17.90]This lady?
[232:21.56]Holy shit.
[232:27.69]She's still alive?
[232:31.51]This is definitely one of those games that had a... is this not a mature rating?
[232:37.46]I let that guy on fire.
[232:41.86]This is raided.
[233:00.23]It's raided, holy shit.
[233:05.19]Why'd you just come in here?
[233:15.54]I actually don't really- I don't like this game.
[233:18.00]It's too much.
[233:18.78]It's scary.
[233:19.82]The underwater scream sounds so horrible.
[233:29.55]No, now you're fucked.
[233:42.97]It's just not nice.
[233:50.89]Nah, I need a better camera angle.
[233:55.45]That was the first person.
[233:56.99]Looks easier.
[234:02.98]So now what's left?
[234:07.64]Just destroy more of the pier?
[234:29.37]Fuck this restaurant.
[234:30.21]Apparently, yeah.
[234:31.77]Can I destroy the whole building?
[234:41.69]Wait, there's a person here.
[234:53.40]Is he dead?
[234:54.42]I think so.
[235:06.08]See, there's the glowing red objects, but... Is there something I need to do to destroy them specifically?
[235:13.92]Just take out the supports?
[235:26.00]There it goes.
[235:26.56]Destroy the inflatable rafts.
[235:37.98]Like, walking towards the shark is probably not the best idea.
[235:39.99]I hate to tell you this.
[235:45.01]Oh, they're trying to get away?
[235:45.97]This is very sad.
[235:48.13]There's a fucking assault rifle.
[235:54.53]Where the hell are we going?
[236:13.35]I'll get over.
[236:15.75]Ugh, this camera's gonna make me puke.
[236:26.20]Alright, so how many more are there?
[236:38.77]One more raft right here, right?
[236:48.70]Do I get to do this?
[236:49.60]I just exploded.
[236:50.30]I just cross-checked that guy.
[236:51.32]What a snipe.
[237:18.72]This is a bad ending.
[237:28.11]Now you can upgrade your abilities.
[237:32.41]Okay.
[237:34.71]Accuracy is Jaw's ability to successfully hit a target near and far.
[237:38.63]Power is Jaw's ability to inflict damage.
[237:45.27]Speed, hunger...
[237:48.07]I'm gonna probably say power.
[237:53.62]I would do power first.
[237:58.38]I thought I just tried to... I mean, sure.
[238:06.39]I tried to press right or left with...
[238:18.44]lock yourself I don't think so the breakout where are they bringing me I just killed like 15 people are you gonna tie me up and bring me to an attraction
[238:50.74]Why would you ever bring Jaws here?
[239:07.25]See, down here, this is where they make the sharks.
[239:08.63]The family has its own great white shark on display for the tourists.
[239:12.16]This is going to fill crowds in record numbers.
[239:14.62]Mayor, our research tank can hold the shark, but we are not prepared to display him in the showroom tank.
[239:19.32]Nonsense.
[239:20.28]The word has already spread.
[239:21.54]Give the people what they want, Brody.
[239:23.26]Mr. Mayor, I understand you captured the shark by the code.
[239:26.31]Is that him?
[239:28.41]My son was killed by a shark there.
[239:30.79]A damn thing ripped right through the cage.
[239:33.09]I demand you kill that creature immediately.
[239:37.19]Alright, fine.
[239:41.79]We'll kill him.
[239:43.16]Let me just scan my fucking poison-electrify-the-water keycard.
[239:49.34]Find an ID card to open the gate.
[239:51.48]I found one.
[239:58.17]Let me in there!
[240:03.87]Wouldn't you be shitting your pants if you saw this?
[240:08.05]This guy's just walking back and forth like nothing.
[240:10.29]That's so loud and obscene.
[240:19.43]Why are there people in here?
[240:24.80]Are these people cleaning the tank?
[240:26.36]Are these fish?
[240:27.32]I don't- I can't even tell what these are.
[240:32.48]Well, we're gonna go this way.
[240:40.97]That scientist definitely has an ID card.
[240:42.69]Why would you ever do this?
[240:45.77]This is the worst scary thing ever.
[240:47.49]Is he just running from me?
[240:53.16]You have like a chain link fence.
[240:59.30]What?
[240:59.76]Oh shit.
[241:10.08]Come here.
[241:10.44]Get in the water.
[241:14.36]Where are we?
[241:19.90]Can I have your key card, please?
[241:22.42]Get in the water.
[241:22.97]Get in the water.
[241:24.73]Get in the water.
[241:27.89]Fuck.
[241:36.01]For the first time ever.
[241:38.15]OK.
[241:40.18]Get the guy with the keycard.
[241:41.30]Come here.
[241:48.55]Is this a stingray?
[241:56.92]I'm trying to eat food.
[242:02.20]Alright, scientist.
[242:05.00]Come with me.
[242:10.86]Drag him into the water.
[242:13.26]Uh... Get in here.
[242:18.78]Okay, now you're fucked.
[242:20.88]You have a keycard?
[242:26.34]That's fucking disgusting.
[242:32.12]Somebody just shot me.
[242:36.47]No, it's this guy right here.
[242:43.07]Keycard!
[242:47.49]No keycard?
[242:53.60]Where's- where am I gonna shop from?
[243:04.29]Why would you still be walking around?
[243:18.68]I mean, yeah, the map is showing me this door, but I need a keycard to go in this door.
[243:21.88]And one of those scientists has a keycard.
[243:40.73]I guess I can't really do anything about that.
[243:42.69]I have to just, yeah, I have to drag a scientist to the door.
[243:46.25]I can't take a keycard and put it in my pocket.
[243:52.87]Come with me.
[243:55.58]I'm about to go in a cage.
[243:57.20]Come with me.
[243:57.54]Come on.
[243:59.78]No, don't go in the cage.
[244:01.38]How am I not in the water?
[244:08.53]Get in the water.
[244:09.73]Go!
[244:11.45]Oh my god, why are you doing this?
[244:14.72]Get in the water.
[244:30.60]Let me get it for a strike.
[244:33.66]I got stuck on top of the cage.
[244:40.34]Alright, where are you?
[244:43.62]Any scientists?
[244:44.14]Just come here.
[244:55.24]Alright, back it up.
[245:00.39]To the door.
[245:03.14]Where's the little... There's a little thing I have to... Where's that little thing?
[245:09.38]It's a device, right?
[245:14.14]Isn't there like a little... Where the hell is it, right?
[245:16.17]It's over there.
[245:26.11]Is he... He's dead.
[245:34.95]Is that guy in here somewhere?
[245:38.67]Is he alive?
[245:44.97]Oh, the puke controls, my god.
[245:57.97]Where the hell's another scientist?
[246:01.59]Come here.
[246:04.50]Open the door.
[246:05.44]Alright, now eat this motherfucker.
[246:10.10]Alright, we're good.
[246:16.27]That's not an entryway.
[246:39.98]No, no, no.
[246:40.40]Get back in the water.
[246:41.64]Don't stay in the water.
[246:42.80]Don't stay out of the water.
[246:55.61]Oh, God.
[246:56.17]I have to stay in first person.
[246:57.23]No, I don't.
[246:57.55]That's even worse.
[247:08.17]What do I need to do here?
[247:15.93]Is there another scientist I have to grab?
[247:25.00]Just jump over the fence?
[247:29.70]Is this a bad idea?
[247:31.38]Is there water over here?
[247:32.22]I don't think there's water over there.
[247:33.42]It's just an elevator.
[247:38.03]Oh, it's over this way.
[247:58.79]Can I please?
[248:00.75]Why would you make a game with a scale this large?
[248:04.02]And, ugh.
[248:04.50]Alright, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[248:24.91]I can break through the glass.
[248:40.40]Any more things I can break?
[248:44.49]I've got a stellar view right now.
[248:56.17]That was actually pretty awesome.
[249:01.78]Now I have to destroy the whole park?
[249:03.38]Can I get out of that fucking rock?
[249:24.07]Well, we got him.
[249:24.71]He's dead.
[249:30.80]We just had to make him run his head into the wall.
[249:33.66]Oh, come on.
[249:37.62]Come on!
[249:39.30]Where's the checkpoint gonna be?
[249:47.46]Alright, we're good.
[249:51.92]Next.
[249:52.24]Not yet, not yet.
[249:56.14]Almost.
[249:56.54]Not yet, though.
[249:59.66]I got his leg.
[250:01.12]Can you smash this?
[250:03.14]Can you break that?
[250:24.75]The thrill of murder is too much for him.
[250:26.87]I'm stuck again.
[250:34.54]Okay.
[250:36.30]So what do you want me to do?
[250:38.86]Is it up top?
[250:43.54]No, it's gonna be something down here.
[250:55.84]Relax.
[251:00.44]I mean, I'm trying to do it.
[251:02.66]It's not quite doing anything.
[251:07.22]Fight all the sharks.
[251:23.56]Alright, my health is good.
[251:26.70]Uh... Come on now.
[251:29.85]That was...
[251:59.90]I thought that guy was gonna get away.
[252:08.38]They should have had that guy jump.
[252:10.66]Let me catch him in my mouth.
[252:19.29]Uh, Rob Schneider... Dude, what happened?
[252:25.68]Rob Schneider was the one that was in the shark costume?
[252:29.52]That makes sense, I guess.
[252:36.88]Oh, I missed that guy.
[252:40.87]Alright, now where?
[252:45.43]Your health is low.
[252:46.49]Wow!
[252:54.04]Break this thing?
[252:56.44]Let me through!
[252:58.68]I've died.
[253:19.19]Brake.
[253:20.81]Brake.
[253:22.45]Brake.
[253:23.89]Do it!
[253:25.35]Do it!
[253:28.73]Brake!
[253:31.55]Let me in!
[253:40.02]It's the underground lab.
[253:40.98]Wanna break out of here?
[253:49.04]Yeah, I can.
[253:52.19]What door is that?
[253:53.13]Oh, hey everybody!
[253:55.73]Welcome to the show!
[253:56.63]Dammit.
[253:57.31]Let's go through the grate.
[254:14.10]You can fit through that.
[254:26.74]Come on.
[254:27.18]Come here.
[254:32.20]I got full health.
[254:34.58]Now it wants me to go through here?
[254:46.28]What is that?
[254:48.13]Oh, shit.
[254:48.99]Here comes an actual fight.
[254:52.11]Who wins?
[254:52.65]Jaws or the killer whale?
[254:54.53]What is that?
[254:57.05]I found a Nautilus?
[254:59.31]You've received 3,000 points.
[255:04.60]Ready to go?
[255:06.68]Holy fuck, he's got my leg.
[255:07.84]Alright, let's go.
[255:09.48]In for the dive.
[255:16.71]Grab his tail.
[255:19.35]Why is he faster than me?
[255:23.85]Got it.
[255:24.47]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[255:34.82]You've unlocked an adventure move.
[255:37.12]Body Bomb.
[255:37.78]Charge attack out of the water and quickly push up to perform this move.
[255:41.28]Nice.
[255:43.76]Speed.
[255:48.08]There we go.
[255:51.99]Now I know Body Bomb?
[255:53.11]I thought he was dead.
[255:57.31]This thing's kicking my ass.
[256:19.97]Did I get him?
[256:20.77]Right in the stomach!
[256:26.51]In his belly!
[256:26.93]His belly!
[256:27.21]I flipped it!
[256:30.93]Got him.
[256:33.53]This is... This is more nausea-inducing than the VR games.
[256:39.75]I'm tearing him apart, though.
[256:42.43]Uh-oh.
[256:46.27]I need food.
[256:51.24]No shit.
[256:52.04]Get out of the way.
[256:52.68]Out of the way.
[256:53.10]Out, out, out, out, out.
[256:53.74]Right here.
[256:54.04]Come here.
[256:55.66]Let that food go.
[256:58.49]No shit.
[257:00.27]God damn it.
[257:24.30]I died to Orca.
[257:31.78]The good thing with the webcam is this is going to be a puke on stream.
[257:39.04]All right, let's try this again.
[257:54.74]I... I gotta flip him.
[258:07.73]The game has first person mode, and it's... yeah, I can't play in this mode.
[258:12.15]Fuck, am I actually gonna throw up to Jaws?
[258:16.68]What is going on?
[258:23.26]Am I in his mouth?
[258:34.55]It's like the frame rate too.
[258:38.12]I can feel it.
[258:38.56]My skin is heating up.
[258:39.58]You know that feeling when your skin's heating up and you're gonna throw up?
[258:48.60]I gotta beat Shamu though.
[258:58.94]I can't throw up.
[259:01.54]Hold on.
[259:09.64]Your mouth is watery.
[259:10.68]My mouth is getting a little- it is getting a little watery.
[259:12.84]My skin's heating up.
[259:15.52]I have that like metallic taste in my mouth.
[259:18.38]I don't know why this game is doing it.
[259:20.80]It's just like the frame rate and the colors.
[259:28.83]If I fucking throw up, I would never ever hear the end of that.
[259:33.79]I can't.
[259:34.49]Okay, here we go.
[259:49.16]Slow.
[259:52.26]I'm leaning back in my chair, far back in my chair.
[259:59.06]Alright, where's the wheel?
[260:02.36]Do I get a trash can?
[260:07.15]No, it's alright.
[260:11.45]I have a cup here.
[260:15.37]Where is it?
[260:17.10]Where is it?
[260:20.76]I have like at least a two and a half serving coffee cup here.
[260:27.40]He's hurt.
[260:40.58]No, it's the one that just stopped going above water!
[260:55.27]How do I look?
[260:57.05]Do I look a little green?
[261:07.14]What?
[261:52.36]Stop going above the water!
[261:57.43]That's half the motion sickness for me is when the game just makes it go above water when I move the... Give me a fish.
[262:11.62]Anybody.
[262:16.24]Where'd he even come from?
[262:33.85]I'm sorry.
[263:18.54]After this boss fight, it's really rewarding.
[263:20.20]This game is fun.
[263:22.36]But I feel like I need to be playing on a TV across the room.
[263:27.49]I'm gonna go across the room.
[264:24.39]What?
[264:25.43]I got it.
[264:34.73]That's not in the game, right?
[264:42.99]That's the dog.
[264:43.61]That doesn't make any sense.
[265:07.18]It's just orange juice.
[265:56.46]There's no food.
[266:32.29]I need audio.
[266:33.19]I can't do this without audio.
[267:48.92]This, this, this, the first person doesn't work.
[267:52.66]How did he even get behind me?
[267:56.93]Where was he?
[268:28.66]He catches me in his mouth every... I don't have any food left.
[269:11.52]This dolphin kills me.
[269:12.73]I'm smashing the PlayStation 2 with my fists.
[269:34.46]Come on!
[270:16.69]Go ahead!
[270:44.90]I can't to see where I am!
[270:46.80]I gotta eat.
[271:20.23]Where is it?
[271:20.75]It's cheering me on.
[271:26.16]Somebody just went in the water.
[271:30.28]Why would you come in the water here?
[271:40.62]All right, can I go in this gullet?
[271:54.04]Maybe when it does that, that, that, like the, it's like a flash.
[272:33.01]How do I beat this, like, fast?
[273:03.89]You can cut him off from the side.
[273:05.09]That's what I was thinking.
[273:06.05]I'm just going to... The tail whip, he kind of pushes you away, though.
[273:14.06]So far, so good.
[273:15.52]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[274:28.42]I can't talk I'm sorry.
[275:08.39]Now he's chasing me!
[275:11.49]That's better.
[275:49.34]I'm not going above the water.
[275:51.42]The game just makes me do that.
[275:57.48]If I had a choice, I wouldn't be doing it.
[276:09.12]Oh my fucking god.
[276:17.48]I swear to fucking god.
[276:23.08]I need to go eat another fucking animal in the other den.
[276:43.52]I have to beat this whale.
[276:44.98]I refuse.
[276:45.92]I'll throw up on stream.
[277:07.08]That's against terms of cer-
[277:42.56]What was that turn around there?
[277:44.74]Give me another seal.
[278:14.65]Alright, this is it.
[278:15.73]Just fucking kill him.
[278:17.33]It shouldn't be taking this long.
[278:31.84]I don't know what happened there.
[278:33.44]Oh, let's go above water and have it splash and flash you.
[279:12.54]Where did he go?
[280:01.01]There is no real threat to the safety of our vacationers or the citizens of Amity.
[280:06.03]I assure you that we are doing everything within our power to deal with this issue.
[280:10.85]The mayor is absolutely correct.
[280:12.83]The threat is minimal, and we'll soon have the shark tracked and captured with the use of our Aurora 2 research vessel.
[280:19.61]Say what you want, but Mr. Mayor, we have too much invested to be careless.
[280:23.90]Until the beast is captured, or better yet, killed, my employees will be on alert.
[280:28.06]And Brody, you better get to him before I do, if you want him alive.
[280:35.20]Sure, I'd like to save my progress.
[280:37.12]4%.
[280:37.14]This is a long game.
[280:53.77]Open ocean.
[280:58.00]I want some spaghetti.
[281:12.71]Please select.
[281:14.15]Press select in order to access the map of Amity Island.
[281:17.07]Okay.
[281:23.21]The column of light indicates a side challenge.
[281:25.33]I'm so slow now.
[281:27.19]Side challenges appear as white triangles on both the map and the radar.
[281:30.55]You can activate side challenges by swimming into the buoy.
[281:34.89]Each side challenge consists of three difficulty levels.
[281:36.99]Completing each level will earn you points for Jaws abilities.
[281:41.32]After you complete the level of a side challenge, a checkpoint will be saved.
[281:44.56]My voice has changed.
[281:48.77]This is a save anchor.
[281:49.97]There are three save anchors located around Amity Island.
[281:53.75]Swimming into these anchors will allow you to save your progress.
[282:02.79]Okay.
[282:04.53]Re-enter completed missions.
[282:05.73]So red is a mission.
[282:07.37]It's an open world now.
[282:10.52]That's really cool.
[282:16.70]Can I grab that out of the air?
[282:17.78]You're doing jet skis?
[282:25.54]I need the health.
[282:39.03]I can jump out of the water and grab the helicopter out of the air.
[282:42.85]That's outrageous.
[282:46.37]Do you want to enter this stage dead of night?
[282:49.81]Uh, no, not yet.
[282:50.45]I'll take a look around.
[283:09.71]Where is it?
[283:10.97]It's underneath me!
[283:15.93]Let's go.
[283:23.56]Is he dead?
[283:38.29]Not quite.
[283:39.69]Now you are.
[283:47.63]He was trying to get away.
[283:48.66]I love that I'm still driving half a second they do on the jet ski.
[283:58.48]Oh, let's do the mission.
[284:00.68]I'll try it.
[284:04.11]Yeah, let's do this.
[284:12.95]What's next?
[284:13.63]Let's see.
[284:19.45]There's so many.
[284:21.01]I got such a list.
[284:23.28]There's so many PlayStation 2 games that still are here.
[284:29.64]What is this one?
[284:34.07]Can you hear how many clicks?
[284:39.40]Mayor, our research clearly indicates the subsonic frequencies used by Shaw's underwater sea-seeker machines are having a dramatic effect on the local shark population.
[284:48.71]It's causing them to approach human settlements and to become increasingly more violent.
[284:52.07]Listen, Brody, I don't know what they- Play Spyro?
[284:54.22]Institutions where you studied, but you're beginning to sound like your dad, your crying wolf.
[284:58.26]Environment Plus is bringing in millions to our community.
[285:00.92]The machines stay.
[285:02.36]The Amity Shark Tournament begins tomorrow, and odds are they will catch the shark before anything else happens.
[285:09.20]That's what you think.
[285:11.76]Find a way through the netting.
[285:17.06]Destroy the little robots.
[285:23.44]One drone down.
[285:25.71]Get the other one.
[285:31.19]Two drones down.
[285:32.99]Destroy this.
[285:36.45]There's a giant plug.
[285:41.53]Okay, that's good.
[285:42.29]Other side, maybe?
[285:45.97]Here!
[285:46.25]Did I bring it down?
[285:48.19]Now it's not electrified, I can go through it.
[285:58.04]Cool.
[286:15.24]Sneak up on the swimmers.
[286:17.56]Stealth kill some of them.
[286:21.64]Right here.
[286:22.66]Oh, it's like a beach party.
[286:41.89]Alright, eat.
[286:43.43]Consume.
[286:43.87]So you don't want him to alert all the others, right?
[286:57.43]From my understanding.
[286:59.55]How did you not hear that scream?
[287:12.35]Tear him apart.
[287:18.31]Oh, Jesus.
[287:19.11]He doesn't have a leg.
[287:23.42]He's sinking to the bottom.
[287:27.04]Destroy the partygoers' boats.
[287:34.48]Who brings, like, a shotgun to a party?
[287:42.11]I just have my shotgun.
[287:43.67]What the fuck are you doing?
[287:50.13]They have, like, sniper rifles?
[287:58.16]That is a huge machine gun.
[288:10.28]Shoot me from under the...
[288:16.00]Ooh, jawbreaker.
[288:19.93]Tin can?
[288:23.23]You unlock a scene, okay.
[288:24.47]That's not a party boat, that's a police boat.
[288:49.09]We're never gonna make it.
[288:51.05]I have to stop.
[288:51.66]I gotta stop playing this game.
[288:56.52]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[288:57.64]We gotta move on to the next one.
[289:00.30]I can't.
[289:00.70]I can't do it.
[289:06.77]Fuck.
[289:07.05]This game's fun.
[289:10.77]I gotta get up.
[289:11.47]I gotta stop.
[289:11.87]I'm just gonna get some water.
[289:25.29]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[289:26.41]I just, like, gotta get out of here.
[289:27.73]I gotta get some water.
[289:32.34]I'm not puking, I'm fine.
[289:35.02]I mean, you maybe can tell from my voice that something might be wrong.
[289:39.14]But everything is completely fine.
[289:40.48]I have absolutely no problem at all.
[289:42.59]I just have to get up and get some water, and I'll be good to go to stream for, like, another hour or two.
[289:47.91]That's a joke voice, by the way, everybody.
[289:49.39]That's a joke.
[293:01.87]Hey, guys, what's going on?
[293:07.20]Oh, he totally just hurled.
[293:09.46]No, I just went down to grab some water.
[293:14.98]To Alex and Cameron, both downstairs.
[293:20.88]I just kind of stumbled in.
[293:21.82]I just walked in like this.
[293:22.88]I was like... I walked in just like...
[293:33.21]Hey.
[293:33.39]I just went over to the fridge and, like, opened it, like, yeah, there's water in here.
[293:39.33]I was just like, you all right?
[293:43.26]Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
[293:44.80]I just, like, almost puked.
[293:54.55]Alright, we're gonna put in another one.
[293:56.49]I'm sorry.
[293:57.75]I can't play this one anymore.
[293:59.79]That's so unfortunate, but it's true.
[294:03.41]Let's move on.
[294:08.31]What was the closest I got to puking?
[294:09.71]Right here.
[294:12.10]I don't know what this one is, but I'm gonna play it.
[294:23.77]This one is called Headhunter.
[294:29.51]Headhunter.
[294:34.57]Why is everybody doing that face?
[294:42.60]What's with the face?
[294:46.62]Oh, this is the P. OK, the startup noise.
[294:48.10]I got you.
[294:55.56]I understand.
[294:58.54]Motion sickness puke or limb ripping puke?
[295:00.88]Motion, what happened?
[295:02.74]What the fuck is going on here?
[295:04.46]Hold on.
[295:04.82]That was odd.
[295:21.80]No, it was definitely a motion sync, this thing.
[295:36.43]I don't know what this game is.
[295:37.99]Headhunters?
[295:38.67]I may have accidentally purchased this.
[296:05.10]Do I have to do initialize?
[296:06.28]I do.
[296:07.80]No.
[296:08.74]No.
[296:09.06]Oh, whatever.
[296:15.22]I got stuck at five minutes into this game.
[296:17.20]Well, that's good.
[296:20.78]Rich guy buys game on accident.
[296:34.76]Normal mode and the action button.
[296:40.61]Press the X button to interact.
[296:49.62]Open door.
[296:51.72]Gun mode and shooting.
[296:52.86]Press and hold the R1 button to raise your weapon.
[296:54.74]Press X to shoot.
[296:56.98]Okay.
[296:57.12]Okay.
[297:03.97]This one has potential.
[297:12.83]While in gun mode, tap the square button to cycle between available targets.
[297:17.91]Hold the square button and push the left or right button on the left analog stick to manually adjust the aim.
[297:22.83]All the green enemies take damage from your gun.
[297:27.74]What's wrong with me right now?
[297:28.96]I feel like I've been sapped.
[297:35.64]While in gun mode, tap... Alright.
[297:39.15]Let's wake up.
[297:42.29]Take it easy, buddy.
[297:43.85]It was the puke.
[297:46.51]Alright, so while in gun mode, tap the square button to cycle to an available target.
[297:50.83]So you hold square to manually adjust the aim.
[297:57.10]Sure.
[298:00.60]Ah, I see.
[298:22.60]Shoot that guy in the back.
[298:24.28]Guy in the back.
[298:25.16]Guy in the back.
[298:30.28]Guy in the back.
[298:36.02]Excellent.
[298:41.41]What?
[298:44.11]Dumb.
[298:44.39]There we go.
[298:53.97]The guy's name is Jack Wade?
[298:55.35]Uh, enter gun mode.
[298:59.89]Tap the circle button to change target to an object.
[299:05.26]Gray enemies will only take damage from explosions.
[299:15.16]Right, well, um...
[299:23.54]Apparently these are my enemies.
[299:27.78]Watch out!
[299:28.83]Alright, I think I understand the game.
[299:35.91]Wall mode in shootouts.
[299:38.33]Triangle when standing close to a wall.
[299:42.18]To move along the wall.
[299:44.62]So you hold R1 while you're on a wall.
[299:48.38]Well, you press and hold R1 when standing by a corner to quickly turn around and press the triangle button again to let go of the wall.
[299:53.84]Okay.
[300:00.87]Wall running?
[300:01.97]I'm not sure that's what this is, but still pretty cool.
[300:07.59]Still pretty cool.
[300:13.89]Yeah, but that's just taking cover.
[300:17.87]Press and hold L1.
[300:18.87]Did I miss a bunch of community subs?
[300:20.13]I did.
[300:24.03]Uh, Herbert gave 10 community subs.
[300:26.01]Thank you.
[300:28.67]For the 10 community subs.
[300:31.78]Appreciate it.
[300:35.86]So, this is how you take cover.
[300:37.66]And this is a dodge roll.
[300:48.15]He died in the simulation.
[300:49.87]This game over, you lose.
[300:53.20]It's fine, it's fine, it's fine!
[301:35.03]Can't you miss every shot?
[302:11.70]Dude, this sucks.
[302:12.76]No, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[302:14.16]No, don't.
[302:16.83]You must have just gotten to the channel.
[302:17.85]You probably think I'm a fucking idiot.
[302:19.51]No, no, no.
[302:20.11]I almost just threw up like five minutes ago.
[302:21.99]I almost puked and it just sapped all my mental energy and now I'm just trying to survive now.
[302:32.44]Who the hell donate organs on location?
[302:39.66]Neural resonance 120 and rising.
[302:42.74]We have core activity.
[302:44.42]Increase to 500 megahertz.
[302:46.92]Subject is conscious.
[302:49.70]Security, it's the alarm.
[302:51.69]We have a situation.
[302:53.77]Make sure you dodge roll first.
[302:55.01]That guy didn't even have a gun.
[302:57.31]Why would you dodge roll?
[302:58.21]Close all exits.
[303:04.95]Rip the oxygen thing out of the back of his head.
[303:17.66]Oh my god.
[303:18.78]Alright, automatic pistol.
[303:19.89]Let's go.
[303:30.77]Shoot him!
[303:34.41]Okay, I got him.
[303:50.90]How do I reload?
[303:51.58]Manual reload is what?
[303:52.64]Triangle?
[303:53.06]I don't think there is a manual reload.
[304:02.22]Reload the gun.
[304:09.45]Just terrible time crisis.
[304:12.09]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[304:13.11]What did I learn, right?
[304:13.91]There's nobody here.
[304:35.94]Nothing.
[304:36.46]Nope.
[304:37.80]No!
[304:38.06]Take that!
[304:45.66]Reload the gun.
[304:52.07]I shot every bullet above that guy's head.
[304:54.41]Every one.
[305:03.82]I'm gonna die.
[305:05.59]Just wait till he gets closer.
[305:29.42]Why did I die?
[305:30.19]I have no idea what killed me.
[305:36.55]I don't have any idea.
[305:38.09]I'm starting to get a little unhinged though.
[305:44.10]Was I bleeding?
[305:44.92]Maybe I was bleeding.
[305:59.01]Got it.
[305:59.45]Nice.
[305:59.71]Keep going.
[306:08.75]Stupid.
[306:09.09]I did the same thing.
[306:22.32]Reload.
[306:23.20]Good.
[306:23.62]Okay.
[306:24.20]So far so good.
[306:25.98]Here it comes.
[306:28.45]Come on up.
[306:37.90]One down.
[306:47.68]I don't even... There's no time limit or anything.
[306:58.51]Got it.
[307:02.90]Doing a lot of checking.
[307:07.94]Am I hearing voices?
[307:14.70]I thought I did kind of shoot myself in the fucking head.
[307:21.34]What the hell was that?
[307:24.00]What?
[307:25.54]Okay, that just freaked me the fuck out.
[307:38.76]This is probably from one decade earlier.
[307:51.90]I freaked out.
[307:58.05]Am I the old lady?
[307:58.75]Am I waking up?
[308:18.44]Where am I?
[308:20.30]Who are you?
[308:22.75]Please, I can't remember.
[308:25.76]Patient's name is Jack Wade.
[308:28.08]Found unconscious in the parking lot of an industrial park a week ago.
[308:31.23]You could say my name, your name.
[308:33.01]In and out of metabolic coma the past three days.
[308:36.63]Gunshot trauma to the leg.
[308:38.67]Evidence of some advanced surgery.
[308:40.79]Surgery?
[308:42.05]What surgery?
[308:43.07]And apparent retrograde amnesia.
[308:45.85]Suggestive therapy controlled neural... Am I in the same room with you?
[308:49.10]You can't just talk to me?
[308:50.42]Mental stimulation.
[308:54.58]A daughter and a nation.
[308:55.92]That's fucking weird that they just did that.
[308:58.82]Christopher Stern, founder and father figure of the ACN, was buried today in Arlington National Cemetery.
[309:05.62]Among the mourners, distraught Angela Stern was comforted by Alan Sharp, recently elected ACN vice president.
[309:12.77]Yeah, you can't throw in... Why is he a computer-generated person?
[309:20.27]And I'm honored to build on the foundations he laid.
[309:23.58]You could save a lot of money by doing full motion cutscenes.
[309:26.52]Like live cutscenes.
[309:43.96]Meanwhile, debate still rages over who was responsible for Stern's assassination.
[309:49.19]Many pointing the finger at self-styled Don Emilio Fulci.
[309:52.77]ABCBS.
[309:53.63]Thought to have links with a criminal syndicate.
[309:55.33]Let's get twice as soon.
[309:56.19]Little is known about Fulci.
[309:57.72]Never seen in public.
[309:58.94]His appearance remains shrouded in mystery.
[310:01.66]An ACN raid on offices of one of Fulci's business interests revealed no trace of the elusive criminal magnate.
[310:09.09]Kate?
[310:09.77]Thanks, Bill.
[310:10.83]In other news, psychotic gangster Esteban Ramirez rose three points on the criminal exchange, hitting a career-high seven.
[310:17.50]Why is this on the news?
[310:18.20]I love this.
[310:18.54]I'm gonna be in this one for a while.
[310:45.83]Smith and Easton Stimulator, ENP automatic.
[310:49.75]Clip size?
[310:50.97]He has a tiny head.
[310:53.41]Combined neurostimulants and motor cortex scrambler, producing incapacity and eventual brain death.
[311:00.94]Like riding a bike.
[311:02.84]I'm Chief Frank Hawk, and you, Wade, were my number one headhunter.
[311:07.82]Eight years, top of the league for six.
[311:10.82]More captures than the rest of them put together.
[311:13.48]I'm a regular hero.
[311:15.32]And now you're fired.
[311:16.90]For life.
[311:18.54]Sorry, Wade, but it's orders.
[311:21.04]They don't even tell me why.
[311:23.18]Times are changing.
[311:25.09]Maybe if we knew what happened to you... You're asking the wrong guy.
[311:29.53]That's too bad.
[311:31.59]You could go independent.
[311:33.51]You'd have to pass the Layla test, but you'd get a weapon and a BM.
[311:38.31]Wouldn't give access to classified files, but it'd be a start.
[311:42.39]Back to school, huh?
[311:43.95]With an EMP gun in your hand, or it could be worse.
[311:47.74]Contact me when you got your Layla license out.
[311:50.26]What are those x-rays over here?
[311:53.22]Word of warning.
[311:55.28]You've woken up with quite a few enemies.
[311:59.06]I wouldn't trust anyone you don't know.
[312:02.27]And right now, you don't know anyone.
[312:06.97]Alright, so I'm erased from all of humanity?
[312:10.39]I don't exist?
[312:17.49]So what's the goal here?
[312:18.90]Get back to number one?
[312:21.62]Isn't this just a plot of No More Heroes?
[312:26.92]Jack...
[312:35.55]I would have loved if she was an actual actress in the virtual world.
[312:39.46]Why didn't they do that?
[312:44.20]I watch TV.
[312:45.90]Christopher Stern's daughter.
[312:47.90]I saw your father's funeral.
[312:50.16]I'm sorry.
[312:51.60]So am I. I want you to help me, Mr. Wade.
[312:55.34]I want you to find the man who killed my father.
[312:57.82]I want Don Fulci to be sorry, too.
[313:01.37]How do you know it was done, Fulci?
[313:03.51]He hated my father and everything he stood for.
[313:06.81]Call it a hunch.
[313:08.17]Why don't you tell it to the ACM?
[313:10.59]They want to see him behind bars.
[313:12.93]I want to see him dead.
[313:14.59]I'm not an executioner.
[313:16.21]Oh, come on.
[313:16.69]Executioner.
[313:17.05]Fuck you again.
[313:17.51]Remember?
[313:21.82]Outside of the killer, you were the last person to see my father alive.
[313:25.98]His diary shows you had a meeting with him.
[313:28.60]You were working together on some kind of secret project.
[313:32.52]Find my father's killer, and maybe you'll find out what happened to you.
[313:37.00]I'll think about it.
[313:39.14]Don't think too long.
[313:40.98]I'd say medical expenses are running at a kidney donation already.
[313:45.35]You can spend the rest of your life hunting lowlifes, or crack the case of the decade for a handsome fee.
[313:53.25]Two million?
[313:53.87]Back in 2001, that was like 50 million.
[313:55.43]Okay.
[314:21.74]So is it break out of hospital scenario here?
[314:26.28]Some place you have here.
[314:28.30]I grew up in this house.
[314:30.43]It seemed real big and exciting then.
[314:33.17]But now, I'll get us an X-Must.
[314:37.07]Take a look around.
[314:37.85]X-Must?
[314:38.59]Maybe some of Daddy's ACN stuff could help jog your memory.
[314:43.47]The different branch of the X-Men?
[314:48.04]Is she really telling everything about her past?
[314:49.58]Contact us for a complete PPFD exam.
[314:55.90]What?
[314:56.10]Okay, I have control again.
[315:02.23]Sorry, I gotta examine the house?
[315:16.15]Swybrook's pretty much our top scientist, a refugee from communist times.
[315:21.25]He developed the criminal control system.
[315:22.71]From communist times?
[315:23.69]Without it, the ACN might have lost its war against crime.
[315:27.11]Okay.
[315:27.88]Daddy was worried about some of the big brother stuff biotech is developing, but Alan's gung-ho.
[315:35.26]This is my gamer diploma.
[315:37.04]Get a license before a license to kill?
[315:39.66]I'll give it a try.
[315:40.38]Someone said there's something wrong with his ass.
[316:04.32]It kind of does look like he has just one butt cheek.
[316:06.65]Just one giant circle butt cheek.
[316:09.51]Is that what you're talking about?
[316:10.27]I'm just somebody... somebody brought it up!
[316:20.42]An agent's handbook.
[316:22.36]The ACN Bible.
[316:24.06]Its history, philosophy, codes of practice.
[316:27.48]My father wrote every word.
[316:30.17]There's background on the standard weapon types, too.
[316:33.29]May want to refresh your memory next time you lay hands on an EMP gun.
[316:38.24]Alright.
[316:39.28]I have to examine every single item in this room.
[316:41.22]Okay.
[316:41.52]Anything else you'd like me to look at?
[316:42.86]The jukebox?
[317:09.94]Can I get a closer look at this painting?
[317:17.35]Is there like a first per- Okay, there is.
[317:20.25]That is- Okay, that does not- That looks very different.
[317:26.02]This is a haunted photo.
[317:40.89]Demon baby.
[317:41.81]Alright.
[317:43.40]I think we can get out of here, maybe?
[317:52.60]Alright, get the keycard.
[317:54.72]From Angela.
[317:55.38]I can explore the mansion still.
[317:58.40]Hang on, the pool?
[318:00.24]I don't think I can go in the pool.
[318:02.12]Unfortunately.
[318:03.68]Training?
[318:03.98]I have a health bar in here.
[318:16.27]Keycard.
[318:17.14]Yeah, even look at the... the mini-map is Metal Gear.
[318:25.02]There's a giant safe.
[318:30.17]Alright, give me the keycard.
[318:35.05]I want to get out of here, dumbhouse.
[318:38.79]Why would I?
[318:39.15]I don't want to do that.
[318:40.23]Oh, God.
[318:40.85]Fine.
[318:41.07]I'll look at your leg.
[318:41.89]Father's diploma.
[318:43.03]Your father's certificate.
[318:44.03]Your father's medical license.
[318:45.38]Tell me all about it.
[318:46.12]All right.
[318:46.36]Can I leave?
[318:46.70]Give me your key card.
[319:06.36]Oh, fuck you.
[319:08.86]Okay, fine.
[319:10.32]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[319:11.96]Down here.
[319:12.38]Uh, inside of a dash of a car.
[319:20.39]Doesn't do anything for me.
[319:22.75]Speed Racer.
[319:24.43]The real life movie.
[319:26.77]Didn't they make one of those?
[319:27.53]Are they making one of those?
[319:28.35]They're making one soon.
[319:34.64]No, none of this shit matters.
[319:37.30]Kitchen?
[319:40.17]What is this?
[319:46.17]Your father was a full motion video game actor?
[319:52.30]That's cool, I guess.
[320:00.62]Oh look, there it is!
[320:02.11]My father used to take these.
[320:04.81]Yeah, my father used to take adrenaline and scream at a wall.
[320:12.07]He used to take adrenaline and see how long he could hold his breath underwater.
[320:15.04]He did it for nine and a half minutes one time.
[320:17.08]Oh my god, what else do you want me to do?
[320:35.09]I have no... I missed a painting in here?
[320:47.82]This one?
[320:48.68]Okay, there it is.
[320:52.32]I mean, I just had an indicator on it.
[320:56.58]How did you know that?
[320:57.24]Dad.
[321:21.62]Hey, there's the key card.
[321:24.48]Good.
[321:24.90]All right, there are drinks.
[321:28.51]I thought there were three cheeseburgers on there.
[321:30.11]I don't know why.
[321:32.59]I thought they were just burgers.
[321:33.63]Really?
[321:50.31]Plus one letter grade, possibly.
[321:51.63]I hope so.
[321:52.23]That'd be amazing.
[321:52.95]She's a synth.
[321:53.42]He's not ready for this.
[322:26.38]Come on let me drive the motorcycle X must oh Yes, yes, yes Is this open world
[322:48.85]You can't turn.
[323:04.37]Skill points?
[323:06.49]You have to understand this is impossible to draw.
[323:09.63]It's almost like I'm lagging.
[323:12.25]And I'm pressing the... I need to prove this to everybody because people are gonna think I'm doing this on purpose.
[323:19.67]You guys need to know this is not on purpose.
[323:21.51]Watch this, ready?
[323:32.72]Did you see that?
[323:37.19]Let's try it again, ready?
[323:43.55]So far so good.
[323:46.01]What happened there?
[323:52.68]Good turn, good turn.
[323:59.10]Why does the road end?
[324:03.50]Did you see that?
[324:14.83]I don't need to prove it.
[324:16.83]I already did.
[324:28.66]Alright, ID check.
[324:31.80]What was the ID check for?
[324:48.50]I went the wrong way.
[324:49.82]I'm getting skill points though, that's good.
[325:01.67]ID check.
[325:05.53]Access level none, access granted.
[325:07.04]Wouldn't that mean access denied?
[325:22.10]Alright, where are we going from here?
[325:31.90]There are other cards.
[325:32.81]Do I have an indicator on the map?
[325:43.61]I don't think you can get an active.
[325:46.27]You can't.
[325:50.53]No, there is no such thing as a car accident.
[325:59.24]No one gets hurt.
[326:06.18]Anybody remember where we were supposed to go?
[326:11.15]Is it select?
[326:13.75]No.
[326:16.26]Earn 250 skill points, then go to Leela and obtain a license.
[326:22.15]That's it.
[326:23.03]Just getting points.
[326:27.31]Okay, I'll try.
[326:27.93]Can I do tricks?
[326:44.99]This is where I got stuck as a dumb kid.
[326:47.71]Alright, go to Leela.
[326:58.54]You got it.
[326:59.36]We should hit the supermarket?
[327:16.32]This feels like a mobile game.
[327:17.66]This feels worse than a mobile game.
[327:23.00]The games in the newspapers are more fun.
[327:34.21]Alright, where are the dishes?
[327:41.49]Right here?
[327:43.11]Oh, come on, really?
[327:46.01]How do I get... I gotta turn into this corner here.
[327:57.20]Right in here.
[328:00.48]Alright.
[328:16.60]How about through here?
[328:17.31]Is there another entrance?
[328:25.85]I can't just go over that.
[328:27.15]Alright.
[328:30.60]Please make this worth my while.
[328:32.06]I've had such patience.
[328:33.74]Okay.
[328:51.25]So far so good.
[329:05.15]Wait, this is like number one hero, right?
[329:07.73]Jack, wait, as I live in grief.
[329:10.37]Sorry, hi.
[329:11.21]What, you don't remember me?
[329:13.19]Boy, that hurts.
[329:14.43]Hank Redwood, professional headhunter.
[329:17.58]You and me, we were real close.
[329:19.72]I was number one, you were right up there at second best.
[329:23.25]I'm only a C-license hero?
[329:24.13]I guess that's okay.
[329:24.97]Being a C-license hero is better than nothing, I guess.
[329:53.21]Found he had a nose for sniffing out lowlife.
[329:55.80]Never had a girlfriend.
[329:57.24]Dog walked out on him.
[329:58.44]Wait a minute.
[329:59.08]How did you know?
[329:59.74]Call it a lucky guess.
[330:02.16]Okay, smartass.
[330:04.14]Go get your C. We'll see who's laughing.
[330:07.87]Oh, and hey, my dog never walked out on me.
[330:12.71]Your dog?
[330:13.27]Here for a license?
[330:17.35]Okay.
[330:19.27]To obtain a law enforcement license, you must pass the entry grade proficiency test using the VR terminal located in the VR room.
[330:26.71]Passing further tests will allow you to upgrade your license if merited by your performance in the field.
[330:32.83]In the unlikely event that you're successful, the VR terminal can also be used to access information from the Layla database.
[330:40.62]Once licensed, you can withdraw equipment from the equipment dispatcher.
[330:47.74]approach the vr terminal that's the easy part are you smelling your fingers all right all right go to the vr terminal sit down have two jacks get shoved in your eyeballs
[331:21.94]Oh for the love of god really Take the test can't wait let's start at one Motorcycle control test reach all checkpoints within the time limit.
[331:36.36]I need to do it within 32 seconds
[331:40.99]So this is not... Is Headhunter a video game?
[331:43.81]I have to beat this guy's number one score on the Donkey Kong cabinet?
[331:46.79]Is that what's going on?
[331:49.67]I thought it was they were assassins.
[331:56.47]How would you do this in 32 seconds?
[332:14.40]Okay, I seriously need to keep the webcam on so you can see this.
[332:19.33]I'm gonna... That's unbelievable.
[332:22.53]I wouldn't just do that.
[332:23.39]I wouldn't just drive into the wall.
[332:32.32]I did it.
[332:49.14]Get a real controller?
[332:50.23]This is a real controller.
[332:54.41]What's wrong with this?
[332:55.85]This is not a real controller.
[333:00.41]I can't physically turn turbo off.
[333:03.40]I don't know how.
[333:03.84]I can't do it.
[333:04.48]It's not possible.
[333:08.56]What's wrong with this?
[333:09.26]I don't understand the problem.
[333:17.27]It's a budget PS2 controller?
[333:26.94]This is the one I got.
[333:27.70]Uh, reach the goal without getting detected.
[333:30.46]If any enemy is alerted, the test has failed.
[333:33.64]Great.
[333:38.97]Uh, oh, alright, the axe.
[333:50.75]How do I do a stealth takedown?
[334:01.76]I just exited.
[334:02.91]Shit.
[334:11.25]Well, I didn't even ta- Nobody ever taught me anything.
[334:23.28]They said I could do a stealth takedown.
[334:28.81]This shit sucks.
[334:29.75]Turn it off.
[334:30.27]Not yet.
[334:40.90]He's gonna turn around, isn't he?
[334:49.64]Okay, let's go.
[334:51.13]I'm not even holding a gun, and I'm pretending to.
[334:52.99]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, come on.
[335:19.25]I gotta wait til- I gotta do a whole new cycle here.
[335:21.09]Oh, there he goes.
[335:27.53]Thank you!
[335:34.36]Bring back your face game so we can mock you.
[335:40.82]Kill off four enemy guards on the other side of the abyss.
[335:43.26]Use the environment for protection.
[335:51.28]Haha, we're laughing at you.
[335:52.74]Fine.
[336:08.97]I'll take it.
[336:09.43]Come on.
[336:09.83]One more.
[336:11.29]Beat Hank's record.
[336:13.73]Where is he?
[336:15.95]Where are you?
[336:20.56]Alright, now the game starts.
[336:33.71]I get my gamer license now.
[336:41.12]Oh, Jesus.
[336:52.89]I don't have to do them all, do I?
[337:02.64]This is worse than Ed, Edd, and Eddy?
[337:06.86]It's alright.
[337:07.56]Just get to the end.
[337:08.20]I thought I was supposed to just get to the end.
[337:24.67]By any means necessary.
[337:27.35]Oh, you're getting tortured again.
[337:28.63]He's torturing us!
[337:35.32]Did somebody just sing to me?
[337:47.08]How about you shoot the guy right next to you?
[337:58.89]Right ahead, good.
[338:03.81]Let me out, please!
[338:05.67]Just wait a minute!
[338:12.13]Just let me get my license.
[338:12.97]And then we can talk about it.
[338:42.03]Alright, license gap.
[338:43.09]Got it.
[338:46.43]See license granted.
[338:48.09]I'm ready.
[338:58.29]We are here for you.
[338:59.99]Don't go to that website.
[339:00.79]It doesn't work.
[339:09.69]Your ID card and VM, Agent Wade.
[339:12.74]Model VM52X standard issue.
[339:15.34]Bio recognition chip identifies the user assessing his digital career resume.
[339:19.84]Access to some information may be restricted.
[339:23.66]You can't tell me what to do, Dad?
[339:25.04]Yes, I can.
[339:25.30]You're my son.
[339:25.76]When you live in this house under my roof... You mow the lawn once every two weeks.
[339:45.39]To collect your other equipment, approach the correct dispenser for your license type and insert your ID card.
[339:53.68]Note, the VM also functions as a cellular phone.
[339:56.92]Do it anyways.
[340:00.00]Get out there on the concrete.
[340:04.44]Hi, Jack.
[340:05.40]How's it feel to be licensed again?
[340:07.34]Like I just graduated kindergarten.
[340:09.71]You have anything on Fulcher yet?
[340:11.39]You'll be the first to know.
[340:13.14]Call me when you do.
[340:14.84]Find him, Jack.
[340:17.68]Wade, good to see you back in the game.
[340:20.76]Yeah, but shooting blind.
[340:22.48]Casio.
[340:23.24]How can I use this thing to get information on past assignments?
[340:26.80]Sorry, Wade, that stuff's classified.
[340:29.66]You don't have clearance.
[340:30.88]Now you're finished with the ACM.
[340:33.17]All right, I'll give this one another minute.
[340:35.47]One more minute.
[340:36.51]60 seconds, starting now.
[340:37.17]What I was working on for Christopher Stern.
[340:39.51]You said you'd help.
[340:41.66]Well, best I can do is to give you level one clearance.
[340:46.39]It'll give access to some of your old files, low security stuff.
[340:51.57]I'm stepping way out of line here.
[340:55.27]That lady keeps cutting herself off.
[340:57.05]All right, database, large files.
[341:00.65]What do you got?
[341:01.75]Licenses, VR terminals, weapons.
[341:06.63]All right, cool.
[341:08.30]Objective.
[341:10.18]Good, let's go.
[341:14.81]You have anything for me?
[341:15.43]I only have like 60 more seconds.
[341:18.81]Oh, fuck you.
[341:19.45]Access denied.
[341:20.13]Oh, I have to go to C. Is there a banana?
[341:21.03]Decoy shells.
[341:21.53]Okay, cool.
[341:48.22]Hello?
[341:49.52]Can we go?
[341:49.96]The disk not being read?
[341:58.41]Damn it.
[342:02.67]Come on.
[342:10.64]I mean, I can't really do this one.
[342:14.79]I have the 50 cent game here.
[342:17.43]50 cent bulletproof.
[342:20.95]We can't do that one now.
[342:21.99]We'll do that one tomorrow.
[342:24.99]Oh, that one's a good one too.
[342:30.25]25 to life.
[342:30.73]I also have... Oh, I can't.
[342:36.02]Come on.
[342:36.34]I actually had to crash.
[342:46.65]I do actually own Blood in the Sand as well for PS3.
[342:53.98]What is this one?
[342:56.52]Oh, right.
[342:57.12]Hey, look.
[342:58.87]Hey, look what I got.
[342:59.49]Remember when I bought this?
[343:06.13]Remember purchasing this one?
[343:20.29]Don't need to play that one anymore.
[343:23.81]Never finished it.
[343:24.41]What are you talking about?
[343:25.21]I did it in one stream.
[343:26.11]Oh, I see I have Freedom Fighters.
[343:33.80]Clock Tower 3.
[343:41.06]What can I do now?
[343:43.52]I actually do have the Alias video game.
[343:46.09]Did we play this one?
[343:49.17]Alias.
[343:50.08]The TV show.
[343:50.68]All right, I'm going to try this one.
[344:09.27]Freedom Fighters is good.
[344:12.48]I'm going to turn this off so I don't flash you guys.
[344:24.25]Play Clock Tower?
[344:25.21]Don't worry, we'll do that tomorrow.
[344:28.75]But you gotta get through the terrible ones first.
[344:32.05]We started off with Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[344:34.33]That was a good one.
[344:35.67]You gotta get through the ones that I... Some of these games that I thought were good.
[344:40.15]I got Urban Chaos.
[344:44.73]I got both the Stuntmans.
[344:47.09]I got PsyOps.
[344:48.11]We got a lot of good ones.
[344:55.57]Let's bring this one back.
[345:05.94]2004 Touchstone Television.
[345:07.42]Claim Entertainment.
[345:12.96]Don't type out the list.
[345:14.58]Why is this shaking?
[345:16.18]I know I still got more that I haven't said.
[345:24.12]Something's wrong with my computer.
[345:25.69]Why is my computer doing that?
[345:28.15]A fan on my computer is like freaking out.
[345:30.01]My motherboard's burning!
[345:45.10]The cock, the cocking of the gun.
[345:51.99]We've got Bristow cornered.
[345:53.78]You want us to bring her in yet?
[345:56.22]Terminate.
[345:57.14]This is funny.
[345:58.84]I was I was.
[346:07.72]Please don't embarrass yourself.
[346:21.26]I'm giving you guys a quick little shave.
[346:51.18]It's still good.
[346:51.76]I'm still doing it.
[346:53.12]Did I scramble my camera's brain?
[346:55.30]There we go.
[347:02.04]That feels better.
[347:12.00]I have like a kind of stiff neck.
[347:15.24]Do it on the mic.
[347:34.50]I don't want to do this.
[347:35.20]It sounds bad.
[347:55.84]Muted?
[348:06.87]I'm gonna break my microphone.
[348:08.45]That's a fucking stupid idea.
[348:15.09]Don't put it down there.
[348:16.33]What the fuck?
[348:17.27]Darn it!
[348:17.72]Stop doing this!
[348:20.56]What the fuck?
[348:25.72]It won't stop!
[348:50.19]Hey, do you just want vibration on the whole fucking time?
[348:54.12]That's what that means.
[348:55.16]They code it in just on or off.
[348:57.84]Off, off, on.
[349:30.69]What am I doing?
[349:31.71]Why would I do that on my teeth?
[349:35.18]That's like chewing tinfoil.
[349:38.42]All right, get on out of here.
[349:41.14]Let's see how bad, oh, this game, oh, the game's bad.
[349:47.37]Um, excuse me.
[350:09.72]Okay.
[350:11.00]I'm ready.
[350:13.99]God, why did I do that to the mic?
[350:15.55]Why did that person tell me to do that?
[350:16.81]It wasn't even fun.
[350:20.10]Do I sound... Does the microphone sound okay?
[350:22.32]We lost contact with a well-placed source who went undercover... How do I sound?
[350:26.36]Do I sound good?
[350:27.20]Do I sound clear?
[350:28.50]...infiltrate a cell run by Anna Espinoza.
[350:30.98]Anna?
[350:31.90]Our source, Agent Jacobs, informed us that Anna has been working on something referred to only as the Machine.
[350:38.19]Before being compromised, he made a successful dead drop inside Anna's current location.
[350:43.35]Monte Carlo Casino operated... It turned on again!
[350:45.63]...from one of his mansions.
[350:46.95]You're saying Sark and Anna are working together?
[350:49.50]That's what you need to find out.
[350:51.26]You and Dixon will be infiltrating the casino.
[350:53.51]We've already established your alias as a new waitress.
[350:56.57]And I'll be posing as a player on the casino floor.
[350:59.29]Casino?
[350:59.91]Ooh.
[351:01.57]Blackjack poker?
[351:03.46]Back of rat?
[351:05.04]After you make contact with me, we can stay in audiovisual contact via your PDA.
[351:09.88]There's two things you have to do in the casino.
[351:12.10]If you get too close to Sark, he'll... Only max bet?
[351:15.26]Go in with $5,000 and put $5,000 on one hand.
[351:20.71]If you win, then you can keep playing with the $5,000 and put the other $5,000 in the bank.
[351:26.89]And then if you lose, just go home.
[351:29.29]That's what he's going to say.
[351:30.23]It probably is what he said, but I talked over it.
[351:32.48]...as well as what Sark and Anna are up to.
[351:35.06]When you find the disc, bring it back to CIA for analysis.
[351:38.62]I don't need to remind you, Sark and Ana are two of your deadliest enemies.
[351:42.56]So watch your back, Cid.
[351:43.74]Hey, um, Cid, so your dad was like, make sure my daughter has the absolute best, and I would- Is that Quentin Tarantino?
[351:48.90]Yes, sir.
[351:49.20]Nope, anything for you.
[351:50.70]Sir, anyway, here's your op-tech for this mission.
[351:53.28]First of all, we have the Tracer Serum to tag Sark's driver.
[351:56.25]Now, whatever you do, don't drink any of this yourself, please, or you're probably gonna have a barium hangover, and trust me, those are the worst.
[352:02.25]This is a Razor Prism.
[352:04.01]Like a 14th failed product line.
[352:04.73]It's a wristwatch that has like a Nintendo DS-esque video game console built into it.
[352:09.05]Connected to Synapse.
[352:09.61]It's $299. $299.
[352:31.53]That was mean.
[352:33.43]That was actually uncalled for, so sorry about that.
[352:35.51]Is this open mic?
[352:36.27]Let me tell you something else.
[352:59.88]I know everyone's gonna say T-pose.
[353:02.02]I already know.
[353:02.38]I can see it already.
[353:03.06]I'm in.
[353:06.53]Find Dixon.
[353:08.17]You got it.
[353:08.43]Drug the chauffeur with the tracer serum.
[353:10.01]Locate Dixon and retrieve your gadgets.
[353:32.62]You new here?
[353:33.84]Don't forget checking all the corners.
[353:35.22]It's a little... Okay.
[353:41.90]This is a duck, and then there's a super duck.
[353:43.62]Okay, find the chauffeur.
[353:50.54]Chauffeur up here?
[353:51.22]Alright, found you.
[353:55.18]Locate Dixon.
[353:56.98]Right on time.
[353:58.22]I just tapped into Casino Security's comm channel.
[354:00.70]Should be able to make this run smoother.
[354:03.32]Here's Marshall's technical support, including the tracer serum.
[354:07.48]Sark's driver is the one in the corner.
[354:09.80]He's been knocking back Bloody Marys for an hour now.
[354:12.18]Good.
[354:16.03]Go check in with the head waitress at the bar and get the drink.
[354:23.81]She kinda runs like an asshole.
[354:30.22]Alright, check in with the waitress.
[354:31.28]Hey, I'd like a drink.
[354:32.52]Another Bloody Mary for the guy in the corner.
[354:35.44]Fine, fine.
[354:36.96]Get your feet- Does he have bare feet on the table?
[354:40.62]Okay, Sid.
[354:41.38]Wait for her to turn her back and then add the serum.
[354:44.40]And now he's legit bare feet on the table.
[354:48.55]Alright.
[354:49.33]Open the inventory.
[354:52.75]Now add the serum to the drink and take the tray to the driver.
[354:55.83]No problem.
[354:59.98]Okay.
[355:01.88]It was quick.
[355:14.59]Changing device.
[355:15.47]Super secret.
[355:16.31]New game.
[355:17.13]No.
[355:17.75]No save data.
[355:25.46]God damn it.
[355:26.16]I can skip all this, right?
[355:29.22]I changed into my spy outfit.
[355:36.71]Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.
[355:39.19]This guy fucking sucks.
[355:40.83]LOL.
[355:45.79]How to lose in a single button press.
[355:48.67]I don't... I guess.
[355:50.49]I know what I'm doing.
[355:51.37]Yes.
[355:51.87]Find, find, find, find, find.
[355:53.91]Locate the agent.
[356:02.62]All right, here we go.
[356:03.06]Ready?
[356:04.70]I, yeah, you, I, I'm gonna, yeah.
[356:09.70]Damn it.
[356:10.20]I thought.
[356:10.48]Good.
[356:12.82]No.
[356:13.84]I thought it was gonna be like that.
[356:14.68]Never mind.
[356:23.89]Waitress.
[356:24.69]I'd like another drink added to the guy that has his dirty fucking feet on the table.
[356:28.89]Fine, fine.
[356:30.45]As long as Mr. Sark's picking up the bill.
[356:32.23]Might as well.
[356:33.16]Okay, Sid.
[356:37.65]Now add the serum to the drinks and take the tray to the driver.
[356:40.73]No problem.
[356:45.21]Good going, Sid.
[356:45.87]Did I just eat it?
[356:48.77]Okay, take the tray.
[356:55.90]You don't think it's suspicious that the waitress is not taking this?
[356:58.12]Why wouldn't the waitress just be like, um, excuse me.
[357:07.02]Oh, he doesn't have... Okay.
[357:07.98]He has shoes on.
[357:18.61]Okay.
[357:22.67]Now what?
[357:25.43]Okay, fine.
[357:25.99]Uh, is he gonna fall down?
[357:35.66]Do I have to drug another one?
[357:47.59]Sir, would you like another drugged drink?
[357:52.03]We're picking up a clear signal from the driver now.
[357:54.09]Before Jacobs was compromised, he indicated that he would be dead dropping the disc in the freezer room beyond the kitchens.
[357:59.86]It's in the back of the casino.
[358:02.24]Great.
[358:02.74]I'm glad I'm dressed for the freezer room.
[358:05.27]Retrieve the disc from the freezer.
[358:09.79]Can I just walk back there?
[358:12.69]Oh no, I don't have to do the... And in heels, too.
[358:26.16]That's probably pretty hard to do.
[358:28.02]Freezer.
[358:37.40]How do I get back there?
[358:38.60]Who saw me do that?
[358:40.10]Wait, wait, wait.
[358:46.91]Who's this guy?
[359:09.86]Cheap security cameras.
[359:17.62]Not allowed to go in the free... Why wouldn't I be allowed to go in the freezer?
[359:21.10]How do I just haymaker?
[359:22.28]Can I talk to this person?
[359:25.12]Hey, let's talk.
[359:30.06]Alright, I just want to talk to you.
[359:36.22]That's not the freezer, but the freezer's back there.
[359:40.24]Talk to me.
[359:41.07]Please.
[359:49.29]Talk to me.
[359:49.81]Just speak to me.
[359:52.15]I need to talk to you for one second.
[359:58.81]She's gone.
[360:12.31]Safe point.
[360:12.79]Got it.
[360:23.88]I'm gonna die of dehydration.
[360:26.86]I'm gonna be fine.
[360:28.88]Don't worry about me.
[360:34.74]You worked there and had to sneak in the back.
[360:38.11]For some strange reason.
[360:45.49]still doing it all right let's go they have to go in the freezer and what are we doing back here sneak past the guards to avoid raising a security alert all right great can't wait to play this frying pan throw into the guy's head maybe

[361:24.88]Right there?
[361:25.33]Fuck.
[361:26.39]Oh no, what am I doing back here?
[361:53.08]Get in there.
[361:57.69]Alright, sneak.
[361:58.29]I'm just gonna go behind this guy.
[362:14.50]Oh, hey!
[362:16.68]I got a cleaver now.
[362:18.19]It's game over for these motherfuckers, I swear to God.

[363:00.11]That's so stupid.
[363:01.53]I found the disk.
[363:02.35]I just had to practice gymnastics.
[363:08.12]I can't break this open?
[363:09.20]All right, give me the disk.
[363:18.39]Found data disk.
[363:22.61]Local area networks just intercepted a cell phone call from Sark.
[363:27.81]Meeting in the Gersh Room.
[363:28.75]Apparently it's an executive suite somewhere inside the mansion.
[363:32.35]Marshall's downloading blueprints of the mansion to your PDA.
[363:35.24]To help you access the location and eavesdrop from it, infiltrate the Gersh Room executive suite and search for information on the machine.
[363:45.34]Alright.
[363:45.66]What?
[363:45.96]What?
[364:01.80]What, is this a meat tenderizer?
[364:07.59]Where are they?
[364:13.09]Hostile target spotted.
[364:19.97]What's wrong with me?
[364:20.99]Open the door.
[364:30.97]Can I step on him?
[364:35.41]That guy went down the whole staircase.
[364:38.65]What else do you have?
[364:42.93]Was the guy attacking me with half of a golf club?
[364:47.01]It's a soup spoon.
[364:48.97]Why don't you have a gun if you're a security guard?
[364:51.61]Why?
[364:54.13]Standard issue soup spoon.
[364:55.63]Okay, I got it.
[364:56.89]Wait, save the game.
[365:01.98]Oh, come on!
[365:03.26]No!
[365:26.77]I got compromised after I- oh, is it because I walked in?
[365:30.98]I walked out there with a spoon?
[365:36.64]Alright, I'm fucking going as fast as I can.
[365:41.88]God damn it.
[365:45.16]Play the next game?
[365:45.90]No, I, I, I, this one's fun.
[366:07.64]Oh shit, is that guy gonna see me?
[366:10.70]God damn it!
[366:14.04]I had it, it was done!
[366:15.10]I had it, I had it done already, and we're all the way back here!
[366:19.40]Oh come on, I was done, it was ready, I beat it, I just... I'm just trying to rush through it, because I don't want to do it again.
[366:36.61]I hit the guy with the soup spoon in the head and then apparently I... I... I was compromised.
[366:49.09]Save at the save point.
[366:50.33]Don't run.
[366:50.79]What are you talking about?
[366:56.71]Can I get control of the game?
[367:09.63]Just do it the way that you're supposed to do it.
[367:11.01]Just wait.
[367:13.11]This guy turns around.
[367:14.29]Okay, give me the disc.
[367:31.42]Do you have a... Change clothes.
[367:36.21]How do I change clothes?
[367:47.03]Is that... I'm still cold?
[367:47.97]Alright, give me the disc.
[367:59.86]Okay, here they come.
[368:00.74]Blueprint.
[368:06.38]Infiltrate the Gersh mansion.
[368:09.06]They heard something.
[368:11.35]The guards heard...
[368:18.50]If they come through this way and they go... Which way do they go?
[368:20.55]Left or right?
[368:20.93]They go that way?
[368:21.43]Okay.
[368:24.67]Save point.
[368:25.31]Right here.
[368:25.89]Fuck.
[368:26.07]Fuck.
[368:26.45]Fuck.
[368:27.01]I thought there was going to be a save point.
[368:38.88]Right there.
[368:40.80]Fuck.
[368:53.19]Thank god.
[369:01.22]Yes, I am absolutely sure.
[369:08.72]Should I take these clothes off?
[369:09.78]Okay, avoid the camera.
[369:20.11]That's gonna be easier said than done.
[369:25.92]Does that guy sleep?
[369:32.26]What's the arc on the camera?
[369:33.75]How far does it go?
[369:34.39]What am I looking at here?
[369:35.19]Am I... 180 degrees?
[369:38.01]60 degrees?
[369:38.89]What's the... What's the arc?
[369:52.68]Third floor.
[369:53.38]I didn't do that.
[369:54.40]What the hell's going on?
[369:56.19]I didn't do what?
[369:56.71]Dialogue options?
[370:25.05]Nice, alright.
[370:27.27]Use a weapon?
[370:33.24]What do you have for a weapon?
[370:38.90]Alright, what do you have?
[370:40.18]Give me a weapon.
[370:40.82]It said use weapon.
[370:42.01]Look for clues.
[370:52.63]I would laugh my ass off if he had a soup ladle.
[370:54.51]Alright, look for clues.
[370:56.35]Let's sneak.
[370:57.51]Save point, good.
[371:03.02]No, don't open this door yet!
[371:04.12]Wait, hold on!
[371:06.94]Save the game.
[371:20.53]She's going 60 FPS on his ass.
[371:28.47]That's quite the way to put it.
[371:29.41]All right, let's get in here.
[371:31.11]Sneak.
[371:36.88]What did I just grab?
[371:48.96]Can you grab?
[371:49.40]Can you pick up people?
[372:00.92]They always go for the headbutts.
[372:10.30]Oops.
[372:11.45]We'll take the... Okay, vodka.
[372:12.77]I get the vodka bottle.
[372:13.47]That's good.
[372:14.93]Probably laptop?
[372:16.39]I would assume?
[372:17.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[372:19.23]What?
[372:31.13]Connecting, downloading, processing.
[372:36.54]Enter access code.
[372:45.07]In the name of God.
[373:04.98]What?
[373:12.67]L1... Okay.
[373:13.51]What color does L1 move?
[373:15.45]L1 moves purple.
[373:20.77]L2... R1...
[373:45.11]Almost.
[373:45.51]R1?
[373:46.99]Or L2?
[373:47.51]Fuck.
[373:52.35]Reset it.
[374:17.52]Yeah, it's definitely... It's A?
[374:26.28]No, no, no.
[374:27.06]Go back.
[374:39.25]A, D, what?
[374:40.89]A, D, B. I don't... A, B, C?
[374:47.34]Why would it be that easy?
[374:48.52]A, B, C. Your password is 123.
[375:02.75]Hot off the press.
[375:04.05]What is it?
[375:04.61]Is it about Jacobs?
[375:06.05]No, it's a dossier on the machine.
[375:08.09]Something Anna prepared for Sark.
[375:09.63]Nothing on Jacobs, but it seems that the followers of Rimbaldi are working on a prototype for it.
[375:16.21]Well, it did keep me out, that's true.
[375:18.67]Where's the plant?
[375:20.30]According to this.
[375:21.92]Oh my God, it's underneath the casino.
[375:24.65]I hate this show and I haven't even seen one episode of it.
[375:27.09]Okay, investigate the weapons facility in the basement of the casino.
[375:57.94]When do I get my first gun?
[376:14.59]Calm down, Germo.
[376:15.73]What?
[376:20.97]No guns?
[376:21.67]Was Alias a show with no guns?
[376:23.46]Or...
[376:24.91]Oh, she had the two sighs, right?
[376:31.27]Right, okay.
[376:37.73]You need to relax?
[376:50.12]Why is everybody telling me to relax?
[376:51.64]What are you talking about?
[377:00.12]Select a button.
[377:00.76]Yeah.
[377:01.00]Um.
[377:03.11]Can you relax?
[377:11.13]I am relaxed!
[377:16.56]Settle down?
[377:19.34]I'm gonna start breaking shit if people don't shut up about this.
[377:23.74]I'm gonna start breaking stuff.
[377:24.86]I have to go down even...
[377:43.37]I have to go down again.
[377:44.37]Can I go down more?
[377:45.51]I feel like I need to keep going down.
[377:49.01]Can this do anything for me?
[378:07.82]No.
[378:19.77]There's a vent right there.
[378:20.68]It's a really awkward face you're making here.
[378:33.14]Climb up on it?
[378:33.84]How do I climb?
[378:55.94]So that's not what I need to do.
[378:57.08]All right.
[378:57.56]So just go in the door?
[378:59.14]I had the right idea.
[379:07.71]It's just the wrong place.
[379:19.83]Get up there.
[379:21.46]Go on.
[379:28.63]Remember when this used to be a VR stream?
[379:32.41]Yeah, I did VR for like three straight streams and I needed to take a break.
[379:35.20]We'll go back to it, don't worry.
[380:06.80]How long ago was that?
[380:09.68]I... Yeah, I know I died.
[380:12.80]Like, I did it.
[380:13.87]I just... I've... I don't even know why I did that.
[380:20.81]Why would I do that?
[380:21.69]I don't know why.
[380:24.59]I don't know.
[380:25.41]It's in my blood.
[380:28.45]Like, I have to make... I guess I have to do, like, the streamer joke.
[380:31.62]I have to.
[380:34.12]It's, like, part of my DNA.
[380:38.30]I didn't even want to do that.
[380:44.68]I thought I could jump.
[381:09.85]Alright, we're good.
[381:11.85]I'm right here.
[381:12.27]It's not that far away.
[381:25.36]Being a streamer isn't a phase, Mom.
[381:26.96]It's in my DNA.
[381:28.76]What?
[381:31.92]I am a goddamn streamer!
[381:33.10]Alright, watch.
[381:35.24]I'm gonna do it again.
[381:46.94]Where's my prompt to go down the ladder?
[381:54.60]Why wouldn't I just use the ladder?
[381:57.54]Just use the ladder.
[381:59.22]Use the ladder.
[381:59.84]It's a very clear ladder.
[382:07.07]I fell very fast, but I still made it.
[382:35.29]So now I gotta go... Something about a weapons?
[382:38.07]Something about weapons?
[382:46.48]Now there are guns.
[382:49.06]Just been introduced.
[382:55.96]Play Freedom Fighters?
[382:56.70]I'm gonna play that tomorrow.
[383:00.50]I'm gonna start with Clock Tower 3 tomorrow.
[383:06.75]Sydney, there's a lot of guards on patrol down here.
[383:09.31]You'll need to take this guy out with your stealth attack.
[383:11.81]Otherwise, you'll alert the whole crowd.
[383:16.68]Use Enhanced Vision.
[383:17.80]Oh, I hate this.
[383:22.94]Enhanced... this is... this is awful vision.
[383:33.21]How do you stealth attack?
[383:54.96]Why did you throw it down?
[383:59.24]Give me the gun!
[384:06.90]Shoot him!
[384:25.97]She's never used a gun before.
[384:32.30]I need to take off the vision thing.
[384:47.29]Who's left?
[384:48.21]One more?
[384:48.49]I think we're good, right?
[385:00.84]Is this a Charlie's Angels video game?
[385:02.72]Not quite.
[385:09.86]You ate a Pop-Tart today and it was gross?
[385:15.34]What kind of Pop-Tart did you eat?
[385:16.92]If it wasn't a s'mores Pop-Tart, then you made the wrong decision.
[385:23.43]Is there another game after this, or is this probably the last one?
[385:25.03]This is probably the last one.
[385:26.77]It's getting late.
[385:28.49]Been going for about six and a half hours.
[385:33.27]We'll pick it up tomorrow.
[385:33.87]Just shoot him.
[385:34.21]You're eating a s'mores Pop-Tart right now?
[385:35.99]That's a great idea.
[385:36.51]Okay, a safe place to use the Razor Prism.
[385:37.83]Looks pretty safe.
[386:04.81]You don't want to vape in public?
[386:06.23]You want to hide?
[386:07.14]Hello?
[387:01.50]Got it!
[387:04.38]Nice backflip, stuntman!
[387:07.04]Okay, now what?
[387:11.42]Safe place?
[387:11.86]Is that person still alive?
[387:20.41]Fingerprint replicator?
[387:32.80]Just run.
[387:33.08]I don't... Do I just have to keep going?
[387:53.84]Holy shit!
[387:56.80]I can't save it.
[388:07.04]We're in a cutscene.
[388:07.52]I will.
[388:07.86]I'll try.
[388:08.08]I got full health for that.
[388:08.82]I got full health.
[388:09.18]I just cheesed it into getting full health.
[388:11.46]That's amazing.
[388:12.30]I need something.
[388:13.90]I need a gun or something right now.
[388:45.22]Give me the gun!
[388:50.02]Why do I only get one shot?
[388:54.86]Oh, this is gonna be the end of the stream!
[388:56.02]It's the end of the stream.
[388:57.77]Oh, god damn it.
[388:58.45]That was an adventure.
[389:19.89]Let's see if I can sprint through this.
[389:31.28]Let me try, let me try.
[389:32.48]Here we go.
[389:39.68]I just have to get downstairs and that's it.
[389:48.47]Goddamn shark game.
[389:50.79]Made me fucking almost throw up and it makes my gamer skills depleted.
[389:58.03]Let's go.
[390:15.83]I'm a good secret agent.
[390:17.57]I got a good shot.
[390:18.53]Alright, let's go.
[390:19.61]Run.
[390:27.80]We'll have to destroy something down here.
[390:31.62]In through there.
[390:37.10]I can get it.
[390:44.36]Faster, faster, faster.
[390:47.84]Do you read me?
[390:49.18]Do you read me?
[390:55.79]Why are you shooting the gun like that?
[391:03.50]Where is it?
[391:03.80]Where's the thing?
[391:04.84]Where's the thing?
[391:05.30]Where's the door?
[391:13.78]OK, laser print this guy.
[391:16.62]I can't even do it.
[391:17.84]I got no more fuel.
[391:37.68]I'm low on gamer fuel, I really am.
[391:42.90]Made it.
[391:44.73]Who cares about saving?
[391:51.55]Press special attack.
[391:55.00]What's special attack?
[392:07.69]That wasn't very special.
[392:10.61]No, no, no, I gotta go.
[392:26.06]Fuck.
[392:28.82]Alright, that's it, I'm gone.
[392:34.06]Ugh.
[392:35.02]I can't.
[392:35.38]I can't.
[392:40.58]I somehow got, I got brighter.
[392:42.02]Oh, it's because of this.
[392:42.64]Alright, thanks everybody for watching.
[392:45.63]I'll see you tomorrow.
[392:47.45]We're gonna start with Clock Tower 3 tomorrow, which is, that's a good one.
[392:51.07]That's a very good one.
[392:52.05]We might even complete that one.
[392:54.43]Don't take my word for it, though.
[393:00.71]I'm gonna shave tonight.
[393:02.73]No, I'm not.
[393:03.89]But didn't I promise I was never gonna shave ever again?
[393:08.51]This, like, there's a bunch left to do still.
[393:12.30]Alright, you blame Ed, Edd, and Eddy for taking two hours.
[393:15.68]But that was fun.
[393:16.58]I liked that game.
[393:17.24]That was a fun game.
[393:18.64]There's nothing wrong with that one.
[393:21.88]Favorite kind of cookie?
[393:23.12]Uh, cookie dough.
[393:25.56]What about that one?
[393:27.82]Alright, that's gonna be it.
[393:31.36]We got through some of the, uh, the worst ones.
[393:36.24]Favorite kind of battery?
[393:36.95]Duracell.
[393:44.32]You know what?
[393:44.78]Let's not even put the outro on.
[393:49.84]I'm getting a new screen.
[393:51.56]That's... That's... Hold on a second.
[393:56.50]Let's go like this.
[394:00.75]I'm gonna get a new screen.
[394:02.59]I can't even go in this world today.
[394:16.17]I actually almost puked.
[394:17.55]That's the first time that's ever happened on stream.
[394:20.71]Alright, let's just go like that.
[394:23.71]I'm going to get a new screen anyways.
[394:28.65]Move this.
[394:30.93]Skipped what?
[394:34.88]End of the stream?
[394:35.38]Yeah, it's getting late.
[394:36.66]We'll pick it up tomorrow.
[394:41.16]What was the cool story?
[394:42.00]Did I just cut myself off?
[394:46.65]I don't know.
[394:48.37]Uh, we got bits to do.
[394:49.53]Let's go down to about seven hours ago now.
[394:55.88]You don't skip the Fruity Loops default track number seven.
[395:02.51]I'm glad you didn't puke because I would have puked too.
[395:04.01]No, I would have muted and fucking ran away.
[395:06.57]I would not have done that on camera or on stream.
[395:13.04]It was pretty close, though.
[395:15.16]I felt fucking terrible.
[395:17.22]I still kind of do.
[395:18.28]That stuck with me after that.
[395:21.02]Anyways, we had, uh... Seven hours ago from Fitty, we had five dolls from Fitty.
[395:27.71]They say, PogChamp, PogChamp, PogChamp.
[395:29.35]Did you see that?
[395:29.97]Elon Musk actually hosted meme review with Justin Roiland.
[395:35.11]It's up on PewDiePie's channel right now.
[395:36.85]This is truly the weirdest timeline.
[395:40.80]It is a weird timeline.
[395:45.79]I did not know that existed.
[395:46.75]That's very strange.
[395:48.31]But... Thank you for the $5.
[395:51.29]Also, thank you to Alec for the $1.
[395:54.84]You like Pop-Tarts?
[395:55.64]What flavor?
[395:56.38]I like s'mores.
[395:59.70]Default strawberry.
[396:01.74]And that's it.
[396:02.76]If you eat cinnamon Pop-Tarts, unfriend me.
[396:16.00]Somebody said die.
[396:18.44]Oh!
[396:22.89]No, no.
[396:24.43]No, no.
[396:27.08]You think I could outact anybody on this platform?
[396:31.66]Come on.
[396:41.18]Hey, Smellyboy, thanks for the $1, Smellyboy.
[396:43.00]Will we ever get the Pokemon stream?
[396:44.50]It would be fun to let chat name a Pokemon you catch.
[396:47.98]No.
[396:50.45]Pokemon's just too... What's going on with my neck there?
[396:52.99]Did you see that?
[396:53.49]It was like... It was like my head was on the wrong angle.
[396:57.65]Look at that.
[396:58.29]What's going on there?
[397:00.61]I like... My face looks photoshopped right now.
[397:08.24]This is...
[397:11.81]Okay, that's better.
[397:14.55]Now I look normal.
[397:15.33]Why was I going like this?
[397:16.21]That's because I'm reading the bits.
[397:18.92]I fucking hate cameras.
[397:29.10]But Pokemon is interesting, but I don't think it's a good stream experience for me.
[397:36.41]I would probably get bored, and it's not because Pokemon's a boring game.
[397:38.95]It's because I get bored easily with games that are slow burns like that.
[397:44.23]Walking around in the dirt and leaves and picking up new animals.
[397:47.82]I don't know if I'd be able to do it.
[397:51.57]But thank you for the suggestion, though.
[397:53.99]Hey, trust no one.
[397:55.09]Thanks for the three bucks.
[397:55.91]Hello, Jeremy.
[397:56.39]It's been a week since you know what happened.
[397:58.65]A little tip.
[397:59.55]It's about your YouTube autoplay issue.
[398:01.82]Let the circle continue.
[398:07.42]Didn't wait.
[398:07.90]What?
[398:09.26]Please let me ask you not to forget the link in the video.
[398:11.74]You forgot to do it last two times.
[398:13.67]Wait, what are you talking about?
[398:15.21]Isn't this the news blooper one?
[398:18.23]Yeah, we watched this.
[398:25.70]No, but this is different?
[398:30.11]This is a different one.
[398:33.83]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[398:35.95]Two of these exist.
[398:38.77]This is a new one.
[398:41.82]I'm having trouble keeping track of all these.
[398:44.22]Alright, let's watch it.
[398:49.34]What am I talking about?
[398:49.84]We watched the news bloopers one two days ago.
[398:58.39]Remember?
[399:03.27]Don't... People are acting like I'm crazy here.
[399:12.92]No, yeah, we did.
[399:15.08]I know.
[399:27.59]Hey, look, I wonder what's going to happen.
[399:31.81]Hmm.
[399:35.99]Wait, this happened again.
[399:37.11]It is a new one.
[399:38.87]Looks like we don't have a choice.
[399:43.93]It is a new one.
[399:48.71]Is this what you want?
[399:53.15]Is this what you want?
[399:54.82]You want this ship?
[400:00.46]I crimped a little bit.
[400:05.42]What is happening?
[400:08.98]We're gonna play this.
[400:10.78]It doesn't fucking work.
[400:14.64]If it works.
[400:20.68]What the fuck?
[400:21.78]Okay, this is the easiest thing you've had to do.
[400:25.65]Here we go, we're almost there.

[401:00.34]Who the fuck is this guy?
[401:01.76]If you don't know what Dean Dingus even stands for, Dean Dingus might have strangled somebody.
[401:06.31]Do you know that?
[401:08.49]I'm all for the middle class.
[401:10.51]Anthony Banthony.
[401:12.77]Anthony Banthony.
[401:13.45]He's for the middle.
[401:13.95]He said it.
[401:14.35]He said he was for the middle class.
[401:15.47]He said it.
[401:16.35]The guy owns like fucking $45 billion and hides it and shit.
[401:19.48]He's like, get the fuck away from my money.
[401:20.96]I'm Anthony fucking Banthony, motherfucker.
[401:27.79]Oh, boy.
[401:29.03]This is fucking cool.
[401:31.69]He's criticizing himself.
[401:33.82]Jesus!
[401:34.30]I feel like I'm in fucking Star Wars.
[401:37.86]No, I ain't slowing down for nothing.
[401:45.38]Fuck me.
[401:46.08]Like, really?
[401:49.40]How did you even get to pull me out of this?

[405:30.81]And I've seen, unfortunately, some of the current stuff going on with YouTube.
[405:35.96]It's kind of a fucked up place now.
[405:38.38]And it's... I'm very glad they don't have to deal with any of that anymore.
[405:42.97]Because that site is... Whoa.
[405:47.95]Whoa, what is going on with that website right now?
[405:57.38]Unfortunately, that's the unfortunate truth.

[412:17.08]I understand.
[412:18.14]Hey, WePhone, thanks for the $2.50.
[412:20.26]Going back to Pete and Pete, I didn't get to experience that show as a kid since I was born the year it ended.
[412:25.00]But I came across it in high school when I had tons of problems with anxiety and depression.
[412:28.64]It's such a cute and wholesome show that helped me escape for a while and put a smile on my face.
[412:33.52]Kind of how your streams help me now.
[412:35.63]Also, the soundtrack is so good.
[412:37.11]What the fuck?
[412:37.63]Yeah, it is.
[412:40.81]It's a great show.
[412:45.05]There's a lot of great characters in that show.
[412:47.21]They go over a lot of great themes.
[412:48.93]They tackle a lot of great stuff in that show.
[412:53.70]Pete and Pete.
[413:00.97]But yeah, thanks for hanging out here.
[413:03.25]I'm glad that something like that can be put in the same sentence.
[413:07.18]Like this stream with a show like that.
[413:10.32]So that's... I don't even know what to say.
[413:13.14]Thank you.
[413:13.76]That means a lot.
[413:16.74]And now let's go to...

[413:43.96]I knew you'd do this and chat.
[413:45.75]I'm that one guy.
[413:47.37]Yeah.
[413:48.11]Sometimes you're going to be the guy.
[413:49.11]You're going to be the one guy.
[413:52.61]I figured out what it is.
[413:54.13]It's because it's like facial hair here and it's nothing here.
[413:58.59]So that's why it looks like my face is floating on top of my neck.
[414:15.68]Now I can't unsee it, right?
[414:22.54]I feel like I could go and pop it off.
[414:25.98]And there's a whole display case of different faces in here.
[414:31.26]Get out of VR.
[414:31.92]You're still in VR.
[414:40.22]Just pull the rubber mask off.
[414:44.71]Hey, Great Canadian Fuck Club, thanks for five community subs.

[414:57.24]Please play Thimbleweed Park.
[414:58.88]It's free on the Unreal Game Store right now.
[415:03.39]I don't know what it is.
[415:05.27]It's because your face is a different color.
[415:06.53]It's because I'm like, I'm puke flushed.
[415:10.49]I get like, I get flushed.
[415:13.43]All the blood.
[415:14.75]This is how, this is why I'm so intelligent.
[415:16.41]You understand?
[415:17.31]All the blood in my body is in three places.
[415:21.32]Up here in the face and head.
[415:23.36]So that this math problem is constantly swirling.
[415:25.70]You know what I mean?
[415:28.44]Collagen in the face.
[415:32.18]And then
[415:34.39]No, it's not in my hands really.
[415:36.49]Maybe in like my, like my thighs.
[415:43.59]In the third place.
[415:54.15]Then the liver.
[415:55.11]Yeah.

[416:06.80]Thank you, Mini Clips, for the $50 you had earlier.
[416:12.64]We touched upon it, but thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[416:15.85]Silver Flame, thanks for the $250.
[416:17.27]First of all, thanks to everyone in chat for the kind message from my late Duck Oswald.
[416:21.05]Anyways, this Ed, Ed, and Ed, and Eddie game makes me think of my favorite TV to video game.
[416:28.01]Honestly, if you enjoy South Park at all, I recommend playing The Stick of Truth.
[416:33.37]I think I own The Stick of Truth.
[416:36.15]Do I?
[416:38.18]I bought it on... That's one of those games that's on sale for like $3 every single six months.
[416:43.90]Like four or five times a year, that game is three bucks.
[416:46.72]I think I just was like, you know what?
[416:49.18]Add the thing to cart.
[416:50.15]Who cares?
[416:55.35]But I've never really played it.
[416:58.05]It looked interesting, though.
[417:00.13]It's really good.
[417:00.77]Yeah.
[417:03.03]They made another one, too.
[417:04.43]The butthole, whatever it was.
[417:05.55]The fractured butthole.
[417:09.03]But, uh, you pretend to be wizards.
[417:12.19]It's just dumb, but fun.
[417:14.53]This is the last of my ad bits, so until another survey comes up, see ya.
[417:18.71]Love ya.
[417:20.45]Thank you, Silverflame, for the suggestion as well.
[417:26.49]South Park.
[417:27.69]I was a big fan of South Park.
[417:29.91]South Park was one of my favorite shows.
[417:31.69]I don't really watch it that much anymore, but I used to watch it all the time.
[417:34.37]I loved it.
[417:36.21]Uh, Pigeon, thanks for the $3, Pigeon.
[417:38.43]Hey, finished my community profile and have determined that you're all freaks.
[417:43.28]Kidding, here it is.
[417:44.10]Uh, love you, German, now and forever and always.
[417:48.28]And if I ever have an opportunity to do a project on you again, I will spring for the opportunity.
[417:51.64]Also, I wrote your shirt... I wore your shirt yesterday and nobody recognized it.
[417:55.83]German Pluto.
[418:00.43]Uh... Do you want me to share this?
[418:03.41]Does this have any, like...
[418:12.82]Yes.
[418:13.46]Are you sure?
[418:13.86]There's no, like, personal info on here?
[418:17.62]Hold on a second.
[418:25.21]Holy shit, this is an entire fucking project.
[418:29.30]What the fuck?
[418:31.16]What?
[418:37.01]Discounting, discretion, and discovering discernible, disclosable discussion of discourse in the discourse of the discourse community.
[418:48.88]A profile of Jerma985's fan community.
[418:52.91]This is real.
[418:53.97]You actually did this.
[418:58.61]I'm... I'm gonna read this whole thing right now.
[419:03.88]Strappin'.
[419:17.57]All right, here we go.
[419:26.31]So this starts, here we go.
[419:29.37]Inside the sleek gray interface of the communication app Discord, you click on that little circle button that's your favorite comedian content creator, Jerma985's community.
[419:38.21]You've always loved Jerma's gameplay commentaries on YouTube, and now that he's streaming live on Twitch, more on that later, you can't get enough of him, so of course you joined his Discord.
[419:47.19]Navigating through the channels you may go straight into the we should do text-to-speech on this Right How do I get like Microsoft Sam to just read this
[420:21.94]Microsoft, Microsoft David.
[420:24.46]You have selected Microsoft David as the default voice.
[420:27.41]Okay.
[420:31.67]So how do I do this?
[420:39.28]How do I do this?
[420:41.82]David sounds really handsome.
[420:46.46]Go get the meme one.
[420:53.03]Is there a way to do that?
[420:54.03]How do I... What's the button?
[420:54.93]I know there's a button.
[421:03.02]Use... Hold on.
[421:04.96]What about Mark?
[421:08.18]Mark is pretty good.
[421:13.08]Select the text.
[421:15.56]I can't right-click on here.
[421:16.70]No.
[421:19.64]No.
[421:21.30]I can't right-click on the article.
[421:27.42]Shit.
[421:34.29]Just download the article?
[421:35.43]I don't think I can even do that.
[421:39.07]Okay, download.
[421:42.35]Okay, this should work now.
[421:45.35]So I own the article.
[421:46.70]I own it.
[421:50.05]Now, select the text.
[421:58.74]No, don't ask Bing.
[422:05.06]Ask Bing.
[422:13.52]I forgot I would have been able to read the whole thing.
[422:16.28]I'm just gonna read it.
[422:19.50]Thanks a lot, Microsoft.
[422:21.26]What if I wanted to hear this play?
[422:27.63]What?
[422:30.23]Always loved Jerma's gameplay commentaries on YouTube.
[422:33.57]And now that he's streaming live on Twitch, more on that later.
[422:37.47]You can't get enough of him, so you of course joined his Discord.
[422:41.97]Navigating through the channels, you may go straight to the reason you joined recommendations.
[422:47.24]where you can suggest that Jerma play your favorite game or do something in person for a stream however, it's more likely that you'll be enticed by the channel referred to as general.
[422:57.53]You click on it, and are greeted with an ongoing discussion about why or why not weebos, people who watch anime, essentially, are degenerates one, and in an instant, they're talking about snow.
[423:10.67]Although you may not agree with some or perhaps even most of the users,
[423:14.59]There is one thing that everyone in that community has in common.
[423:18.23]As community moderator Noah Effectator states, that's the thing.
[423:22.91]Jerma's discourse community is populated not necessarily by like-minded individuals, but by people who all have one thing in common.
[423:31.05]They have a desire to watch this one man entertain thousands of people by doing whatever he feels like doing.
[423:36.67]Don't look at my armpit hair!
[423:38.43]To one Discord user, Laser2Noah,
[423:41.39]Wait, what is this?
[423:44.71]Why are we getting... Oh, this is... God damn it.
[423:51.28]This is like... It's important to recognize what a moderator does exactly.
[423:57.74]A moderator makes sure that the people participating in live streams can behave themselves and follow rules the live streamer wishes them to follow.
[424:06.62]Moderators can mute people, ban them, and do several other things.
[424:11.47]3.
[424:11.67]So it goes without saying that an expert of the community, which linguist John Swales attests to being vital to a discourse community, that it has changing memberships for would definitely be a moderator, as moderator Grump Klump of three years confirms, moderators are chosen if they are rational and highly involved members of the community that prove themselves to be upstanding people that can enforce rules and keep a level head.
[424:37.49]5.
[424:37.53]This expertise is proven to be beneficial to the community.
[424:41.16]As on Jerma's Twitch.tv, Twitch is a platform where people can stream themselves playing video games, card games, skits, drawing, whatever you can imagine, and includes with that stream, the live chat in which any user can say something to the streamer or other users in the chat, channel, what is known as live chat goes by incredibly fast, and it can be incomprehensibly difficult to moderate chat when the messages scroll by so quickly.
[425:11.09]What helps this is Discord, which the discourse community utilizes alongside Twitch Force Wales .
[425:18.45]The Concept of Discourse Community Genre Analysis, English in Academic and Research Settings Boston, Cambridge UP, 1995 Grump Klump, interviewed by Joey Provost on Discord, on February 15, 2019 What is Discord, anyway?
[425:39.01]Discord is an application that people can use in order to communicate, whether that be through images, videos, voice, or text chat.
[425:47.67]Jerma's Discord community is one that boasts 16,608 members.
[425:51.75]And while you may think that it is a disaster to communicate in a server that large, only 30 to 50 people will be talking at the same time, even less in the same channel.
[426:03.65]So why even bother with the Discord when Twitch has its own chat already?
[426:08.31]Noah.
[426:09.06]A moderator of both Jerma's Discord and Twitch channel for about a year and a half.
[426:13.75]Found from simply messaging him on the Discord.
[426:16.61]That's not true.
[426:18.69]Answers this question.
[426:20.23]Twitch is all live.
[426:21.75]The chat goes by extremely fast.
[426:24.67]Due to the fast nature of live streams and the fact that thousands of people are watching at any given point.
[426:30.65]Mob.
[426:32.68]Mentality can come through sometimes.
[426:34.54]In comparison to the Discord which is basically just a slower chat room.
[426:40.12]6.
[426:40.16]So it seems that the Discord is there for a more reliable method of communication than live chat which disappears after a set time.
[426:47.93]GrumpClump clarifies this observation, I don't really consider this community to have a set goal, other than to have a place to enjoy yourself.
[426:56.13]7.
[426:56.57]So then the Discord is used in different ways by everybody, and nobody really seems to have a concise answer to the question of what the purpose of the community is.
[427:05.80]But as Swale states, the goals of the discourse may not be explicitly stated.
[427:12.61]Note that other terminology.
[427:14.03]9 Grump Klump, interviewed by Joey.
[427:18.31]6 Noah, interviewed by Joey Provost.
[427:21.38]Wait, why is he doing this?
[427:23.98]In comparison to the Discord, which is basically just a slower chat room.
[427:28.96]6.
[427:29.00]So it seems that the Discord is there for a more reliable method of communication than live chat which disappears after a set time.
[427:36.73]GrumpClump clarifies this observation, I don't really consider this community to have a set goal, other than to have a place to enjoy yourself.
[427:44.97]7.
[427:45.41]So then the Discord is used in different ways by everybody, and nobody really seems to have a concise answer to the question of what the purpose of the community is, but as Swales states,
[427:56.27]The goals of a discourse may not be explicitly stated.
[427:59.66]However, it still is a discourse community if it adheres to the other five characteristics.
[428:04.30]Eight, but again, the common factor in all of this is the adoration of Jerma, which unites the discourse community.
[428:11.72]Six, Noah.
[428:12.78]Interviewed by Joey Provost on Discord on February 15th, 2000.
[428:18.20]Mentality.
[428:19.89]Why mentality?
[428:21.75]Twelve, Grump Klump.
[428:24.05]The Discord.
[428:25.17]members of the community also create genre by participating in the live chat and also by influencing germa as he frequently will read the chat the live chat grump clump says is the majority of the community they are the loudest and have the strongest herd mentality nine further because of the common trait that they all like watching germa chat also seems to focus a lot on trying to send a message to germa in the form of chat in order for germa to read it
[428:54.84]which appears to be easily overwhelming for the moderators to be able to moderate that flow of text.
[429:00.99]However, new member of three months, Dr. HunkaliciousKritiKrat equals three tells us how Jerma doesn't use the Discord often enough and rarely posts on Twitter.
[429:10.58]Chat is where a lot of content comes from Jerma also.
[429:14.42]Chat has a powerful influence on the community and it's where a lot of terms and culture of the community is formed.
[429:21.31]So it seems then that both the Discord and Twitch chat are essential to the community.
[429:26.50]It also appears that in this community, the characteristics of intercommunication, participation, and genre which are vital to a discourse community 11 are all interconnected, as participation cause genre, genre causes participation as well as intercommunication, and intercommunication causes participation.
[429:47.07]The method and the way in which go about communicating is unique,
[429:50.69]to say the least.
[429:52.54]Nine Grump Klump, interviewed by Joey- Nine Grump Klump, interview, interview, interview.
[429:59.42]12 I can, however, list two of the most essential.
[430:02.19]Note that other terminology can always be asked on the Discord for a hasty, thorough response.
[430:07.51]No, no, no, no, what about this part?
[430:10.01]You skipped this part.
[430:10.81]You skipped this part.
[430:11.73]One.
[430:12.07]No, one.
[430:12.49]No, don't!
[430:14.11]Okay.
[430:14.41]Easy there, text-to-speech man reading out stuff.
[430:46.26]Why did I just fall down?
[430:47.48]Oh.
[430:48.44]Okay.
[430:52.60]Well, that was fucking wild.
[430:55.10]I thought that was just an elaborate joke that you were pulling.
[431:01.03]That's it.
[431:01.33]There's no more pages.
[431:03.27]I'll read the last page.
[431:04.33]The last page is one.
[431:05.65]It's given terminology.
[431:07.25]Talking about one guy.
[431:08.65]People doing minus two, plus two.
[431:10.47]You know, community terms.
[431:13.42]And it ends with
[431:19.04]That's how it ends.
[431:22.84]Dr. Hunkalicious equals three kritikrat.
[431:29.49]I zoned all of that out.
[431:31.29]I didn't pay attention to a word of that.
[431:33.65]All I heard was 12 grump clump and then interviewed by Hunkalicious.
[431:46.49]Boston.
[431:47.91]No, I'm kidding.
[431:48.39]That's hilarious.
[431:51.49]Where's my quote?
[431:52.09]You didn't use my quote.
[431:55.43]I specifically gave you a quote you were supposed to use.
[431:57.75]It was about lifting and eating vegetables and fruits and carrots and shit, and it's not in here.
[432:03.63]Rewrite it.
[432:09.15]It wasn't relevant.
[432:10.37]Of course it's always... That's always relevant.
[432:13.49]Was it relevant?
[432:15.32]Eating carrots is irrelevant.
[432:17.76]I'd like you to tell your professor that and see what he says.
[432:21.78]I'm like frozen in time for some reason.
[432:23.32]Why am I doing that?
[432:24.31]I'm completely frozen in time.
[432:27.01]But no, seriously, thank you.
[432:27.93]That was fucking hilarious.
[432:29.01]Thank you, Pigeon.

[436:29.52]They're going to take up too many slots.
[436:32.58]They won't be there.

[436:42.35]But thank you.

[437:19.16]Yeah, I mean, they are now.

[437:33.69]What is it?
[437:45.08]Let's see.
[437:46.84]From Yanwen Len.
[437:50.81]This says, hey, read out loud.
[437:54.49]Don't read out loud.
[437:59.13]What?
[438:02.58]So don't, wait, don't, you don't want me to, don't read it?
[438:04.24]Oh, all right.
[438:12.86]Okay, I'm probably not going to read it.
[438:16.58]I'm going to read this personally because it does say don't read out loud.
[438:21.95]So I'm going to read this personally.
[438:26.45]Don't not read it.
[438:30.71]Let me just make sure that it doesn't say anything else.
[438:33.83]I want to make sure.
[438:37.41]There is some artwork.
[438:44.05]Let me see what it is.
[438:47.74]Uh, this is for saving 70,000 seagulls.
[438:52.22]Let's take a look.
[438:56.58]This is called Germagull.
[439:00.34]Let's take a look.
[439:02.64]You can show the art.
[439:03.30]Alright, I'll show the art.
[439:14.57]Oh my god.
[439:18.50]That's insane.
[439:25.96]That's unbelievable.
[439:27.02]I'm not going to put this on stream.
[439:32.23]Take a look at this.
[439:34.89]Take a look at this.
[439:38.91]The talent is just not even measurable.
[439:47.88]Where did I just save that to?
[439:48.76]It's right there.
[439:59.03]Is it too big for me to put it on stream?
[440:01.33]No, there it is.
[440:02.87]Holy shit, this is insanely detailed.
[440:09.19]Where'd it go?
[440:12.05]Where'd it go?
[440:12.45]I just lost it.
[440:18.80]Here we go.
[440:27.52]Look at this thing.
[440:35.40]That is so beautiful.
[440:38.70]Look at that gull.
[440:42.83]Thank you so much for this, Yanwen.
[440:44.91]Yanwen Lin.
[440:46.75]This is like the third or fourth incredibly well-done, detailed piece of artwork that you have given us the joy of seeing.
[440:56.02]So, thank you.
[441:03.90]That's unbelievable.
[441:08.62]Save the gold from the greasy boomer hands.
[441:11.86]Like, like that's just, that's just my face.
[441:18.00]That's amazing.
[441:18.58]I will read your message in private, but thank you so much for your incredible amount of contributions to this stream.
[441:25.78]Thank you.
[441:29.04]Thank you.
[441:29.36]Thank you.
[441:29.64]Thank you.
[441:32.54]And let's move on from there.
[441:34.62]We had $2 and 50 cents were mostly lost.
[441:38.44]It never snows in Nevada, the state with the fourth largest ski area in the country.
[441:49.30]You gonna throw that at me right now?
[441:55.02]Last time it snowed in Las Vegas was 10 years ago.
[441:59.57]Sorry, I don't know every single place in Nevada that has snow.
[442:04.79]I moved to the driest, one of the driest places in the country.
[442:07.83]And this place didn't have snow for 10 years.
[442:10.15]So am I automatically supposed to assume that there's like snow over there?
[442:16.09]Baby's hungry!
[442:16.93]Baby's hungry!
[442:17.71]Baby's hungry!
[442:18.85]That's probably really loud.
[442:19.65]I'm sorry.
[442:25.99]Time to move to Phoenix.
[442:33.07]Hey, FrodeonWeapon, thanks for the $2.50.
[442:34.77]I caught Cheeto stealing cookies from the cookie jar.
[442:38.11]When he saw me, he threatened to attack me with his giant stuffed rat.
[442:41.72]You really need to have a talk with that kid.
[442:43.92]He's going to spoil his appetite.
[442:55.49]This reminds me of Calvin and Hobbes.
[443:08.14]That's a really great Calvin and Cheeto.
[443:11.32]Cheeto and Hobbes.
[443:16.58]Who's my favorite Bionicle character?
[443:18.92]The green one.
[443:23.02]But thank you for that.
[443:25.69]Thank you for that image, Feroidian Weapon.
[443:31.41]It's his rebellious adolescent phase, right?
[443:35.88]Uh, thank you Nate for the four dollars.
[443:37.22]Ed, Edd n Eddy was more fun than this shit.
[443:39.44]You talking about the game where I almost puked?
[443:44.75]I liked Edd n Eddy, I thought it was fun.
[443:47.91]I put up like two hours into it.
[443:49.69]I almost beat the whole game on stream.
[443:53.39]Flex my biceps?
[443:54.51]Alright, fine.
[444:00.70]That one was for free.
[444:09.15]Thank you, Nate, though.
[444:09.89]Listen, Jeremy, you at least have to try Half-Life 2 Grunt.
[444:17.18]It's real.
[444:36.94]Turn the music off.
[444:39.30]I just want to let you know.
[444:44.56]No, turn the music off.
[444:49.39]I'm probably not going to play any Half-Life game on the stream.
[444:53.85]I want to say very quietly so everybody can lean in and hear me.
[445:01.89]Half-Life is not going to be played on stream.
[445:05.06]Just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[445:07.02]Everybody.
[445:14.68]Thank you.
[445:18.39]For the three dollars.
[445:25.53]Hey!
[445:25.87]Mostly lost.
[445:26.47]Thanks for the two dollars and fifty cents.
[445:29.11]Jaws has my favorite movie quote of all time.
[445:31.69]We're gonna need a bigger streamer.
[445:56.18]You see me laughing at that?
[446:07.31]Not fucking funny.
[446:13.33]Hey, Nate, thanks for the free bucks.
[446:14.60]Streamer kills innocent swimmers and civilians because he's a shark.
[446:19.98]Take my teeth in.
[446:20.90]Thank you.
[446:21.74]Herbert, thanks for the community subs.
[446:23.62]Cricky Ricky, thanks for the one dollar.
[446:25.66]This game was great.
[446:26.42]I remember a level where you have to go really deep and it scared me as a kid.
[446:29.16]I hope it didn't make you puke as a kid.
[446:32.73]For some reason, it almost made me.
[446:36.65]Do you classic Sonic impressions?
[446:37.95]Sure.
[446:41.41]Uh... Hey!
[446:46.99]Hey!
[446:49.13]You don't know how to do a sonic impression?
[446:54.29]I'm never coming back again.
[446:58.43]You're not coming back?
[446:59.25]Why?
[446:59.93]Whatever.
[447:03.03]I'm never coming back again.
[447:06.32]I'm sorry that you didn't like it.
[447:09.20]Fuck.
[447:14.38]I hope you find a streamer that you like.
[447:18.53]Damn it, I lost another one.
[447:22.31]So here's how you do a Sonic the Hedgehog impression.
[447:25.13]Open up your favorite YouTuber and just study the way that they talk and then just talk like them into a microphone.
[447:31.79]Okay, everybody, welcome to the next Sonic the Hedgehog video game.
[447:35.09]As you see here, I'm playing Happy Wheels and just barely almost fell over there.
[447:40.48]Almost got it.
[447:41.76]I gotta go really fast to try to get over that, though.
[447:45.58]That's how you do it.
[447:52.04]Just open up your favorite YouTuber.
[447:54.44]Just do the Tuber voice.
[447:58.21]Just do the Germacraft voice.
[448:03.09]But thank you, Nate, for the two bucks.
[448:04.15]You're losing to Free Willy.
[448:06.09]Free Willy.
[448:10.19]Free Willy.
[448:11.85]There's a series of movies where the whale, and yes, I'm not going to put my hands up that high, when a whale jumps over the kid.
[448:19.47]I've seen him before.
[448:21.72]And thank you, Nate, again, for the $4.
[448:23.16]Nice job.
[448:23.54]You canceled Free Willy 5, the fifth part of the movie's canceled franchise.
[448:27.76]You're the real reason Free Willy 5 isn't here.
[448:32.84]Why would there be a fifth Free Willy?
[448:36.71]They probably ran out of ideas after the first one.
[448:40.63]How many times can you free Willy from being at the zoo?
[448:51.51]They have to free Willy again.
[448:54.12]Five times.
[448:57.48]I fucking lied, I'm back already.
[449:08.94]Why am I falling?
[449:10.10]This is weird.
[449:14.13]Sweat check?
[449:14.91]Nope.
[449:17.35]But thank you, Nate.
[449:17.93]Thank you, Niall Arian, for the three bucks.
[449:19.35]Hey, Germ.
[449:20.23]I played my first live show last night.
[449:22.25]I felt like letting you know because you're like my second dad, twice removed, so you kind of mean a lot to me.
[449:26.78]I hope the show is fantastic.
[449:29.64]You know, I hope you were like... What, you played the violin, right?
[449:36.78]I don't know.
[449:37.08]I'm not sure what you do, but... I didn't actually know.
[449:39.56]Yeah, I do.
[449:44.63]Sour, please.
[449:47.87]I'm too drunk to do emotes.
[449:51.55]No.
[449:52.15]That's great.
[449:52.99]Keep doing it.
[449:53.89]Keep doing shows.
[449:57.53]Come on, Dad.
[450:01.52]You didn't have BTTV.
[450:02.82]Yes, I do.
[450:03.32]I see the guy going like this.
[450:08.74]You didn't think I installed it.
[450:13.35]But, no, thank you, Niall Arion, for the three bucks.
[450:15.33]Yes.
[450:16.96]I'm happy you had a good show.
[450:21.45]He knows.
[450:21.93]I know.
[450:22.43]I'm not an idiot.
[450:25.85]I'm not an imbecile.
[450:31.16]Hey, peaceful Haley.
[450:34.26]Thanks for the $2.50.

[450:50.03]You as well.
[450:53.01]Launch meat.
[450:53.55]That was actually pretty good.
[450:55.61]I'm gonna use that one.
[450:56.41]I'm gonna go downstairs.
[450:57.19]I'm gonna say that to Kim.
[450:59.55]And she's gonna fucking... Get a peepo dance or I'm firing you.
[451:07.06]Get peepo dance.
[451:07.98]Oh, I know what that one is.
[451:09.64]It's like the... Like the bird, right?
[451:12.72]I know what these all are.
[451:21.86]No.
[451:22.70]What's the bird?
[451:25.67]What's the bird that goes like this?
[451:33.59]That's peepo bird.
[451:39.37]That's rare par- that's rare parrot.
[451:43.61]No it isn't.
[451:44.73]That's peepo.
[451:46.19]That's a peepo to me.
[452:25.94]Cool dance.
[452:27.74]Thank you.
[452:28.04]Yes is online for the $2.50.

[452:34.30]I'm ready.
[452:34.64]Let's hear it.
[452:39.02]What's the best Kanye West album?
[452:41.50]By the way, this is the most divisive question scientifically known to man.
[452:46.86]What's the best Kanye album?
[452:58.17]What a dumb question.
[453:04.09]That's a true chat fucking answer.
[453:14.22]Oh, sorry.
[453:20.53]Look at how much fucking cooler I look like that.
[453:27.18]I've never listened to Kanye?
[453:29.06]Um... Hold on.
[453:32.58]Uh... Uh... No, no, no, it's... No, I was just a Chad!
[453:40.37]I've actually never really listened to a Kanye album before.
[453:44.91]Sorry.
[453:48.72]I'm sorry.
[453:49.98]I'm sorry.
[454:01.99]Wow, you suck.
[454:03.07]I've heard Kanye.
[454:04.27]What's the one that I, uh... What a versatile actor.
[454:14.42]You find me somebody on Twitch or on YouTube that thinks that they can out-act me and I will have already ran ten circles around them before they even get into the workshop.
[454:39.49]Somebody actually had a really funny idea.
[454:40.99]And I kind of want to do it, but it might take a little while.
[454:44.65]I don't know where this came from.
[454:46.77]It came from right now.
[454:49.81]Uh... It'd be funny.
[454:51.45]You know Family Feud?
[454:52.21]We play it all the time.
[454:54.24]It's a staple on the channel.
[454:55.50]We play it like once every few months.
[454:58.78]Actually do a Family Feud.
[455:00.82]Where the community is asked questions.
[455:04.26]And people are surveyed.
[455:06.47]and do a full like couple hour long family feud based on me needing to figure out what people in the community had to say like a real life family feud get in the studio get like two families hire a bunch of like actors like two people that don't even know who the fuck I am
[455:42.17]And I have to get the quick... If I fall down one more time... I'll put my foot through the ceiling.
[455:48.09]That would take so much sorting, but yeah, but I've... I could assemble a team.
[455:56.69]I could assemble a team.
[455:59.11]Don't get sued?
[455:59.79]It's not gonna be called family-fueled.
[456:01.17]It'd be called like... Bring out the family or something.
[456:05.03]Doesn't matter.
[456:06.69]Bring on the family!
[456:09.09]Change the colors.

[457:19.94]How are you supposed to get rid of it?

[457:35.45]You're projecting.
[457:39.78]Into your sink, see?
[457:45.52]Just blow your nose.
[457:46.40]That's what you do.
[457:47.06]I know, that's what I'm saying.
[457:48.07]Like you blow your nose, but that doesn't work.
[457:51.61]I'm sorry, guys.
[457:52.61]It doesn't fucking work.
[457:54.09]No, if you go like this, if you have like boogers in your nose and you go, they're going to get all over your mouth and like all up here and shit.
[458:01.42]It doesn't work.
[458:02.16]That doesn't do anything.
[458:04.36]It just like blows them all over your face.
[458:06.10]Like you got hit in the face with a bug riding a motorcycle.
[458:10.99]Dried boogers you can't give, okay.
[458:14.23]I'm telling you, you can call me crazy if you want, but you all know it's true.
[458:21.95]Do you not use a tissue when you blow your nose?
[458:23.45]You can use a tissue, but if you have, okay, mucus, like I'm sick.
[458:28.24]Oh, I'm sick.
[458:29.14]Oh, I can't, like I'm sick.
[458:30.56]Yeah, of course you're gonna blow your nose and you're gonna get the mucus out of your membranes and sinus membranes and shit.
[458:35.58]But man, if you have boogers in your nose, they're not gonna come out with just blowing your nose.
[458:38.32]You have to get in there.
[458:45.34]Yeah, oh, he's crazy.
[458:46.48]One of you guys is doing this right now like he's insane You're like wiping it on your like fucking cup that's in front of you.
[458:52.34]What's wrong with you?
[458:55.42]Like if you lifted up the cup that was in front of you right now on your desk the coffee cup that's sitting on your desk There would be at least seven or eight boogers on the side of it.
[459:03.81]That's revolting of you I'm glad you're not gonna lift that cup up into frame so people could see that unbelievable
[459:19.62]Hey, thank you, Biker, for the $1.
[459:22.86]I've been having a rough past few months with my senior engineering design class, and your stream has been helping me keep me sane.
[459:29.73]Keeping me sane.
[459:35.85]Senior engineering design class.
[459:39.00]That sounds pretty difficult.
[459:40.86]But thank you for sticking around.
[459:43.48]We're all happy to help here.
[459:45.06]We're all happy to be a fun community.
[459:47.34]So thank you for being here.
[459:51.28]Do you wipe sitting or standing?
[459:55.22]That's like, why do we have to answer these questions?
[459:57.82]You know what I mean?
[459:58.98]I don't.
[460:00.04]At all.
[460:08.42]Uh, thank you to EXEXEFUR for the three dollars.
[460:12.86]Jeremy, you're the most jacked, unfit dude I've ever seen.
[460:15.56]Keep it up.
[460:19.56]He dips, he dips down into the toilet.
[460:26.14]Oh my fucking God, that is awful.
[460:29.12]He dips down.
[460:31.32]He goes, he just like fucking dunkaroos his ass into the bowl.
[460:36.86]Oh, that's fucking horrible.
[460:46.55]I can't keep, I can't go on after that one.
[460:57.43]Aye aye aye.
[460:59.53]Alright, my phone's going to the fucking ceiling.
[461:05.31]You gotta end the stream.
[461:06.29]Now, the reverse bidet.
[461:07.39]And then you got, like, water all over you.
[461:08.97]What are you gonna do?
[461:10.69]Oy.
[461:12.97]That's a poo-poo joke streamer.
[461:14.43]I didn't make one reference to those words.
[461:18.23]I didn't make a single reference to what kind of bathroom behavior I was doing.
[461:24.16]When did I say that?
[461:26.66]Somebody asked me if I stand or sit when I wipe, and that could mean anything.
[461:30.58]That could mean... Like fucking, you know, like the mirror.
[461:36.46]Or the window, when you clean your windows.
[461:41.63]Popular toilet humor comedian, Jeremy... How dare you?
[461:47.23]Toilet comedian.
[461:48.67]Toilet.
[461:49.51]Toilet comedian?
[461:51.12]Toilet comedian?
[461:53.66]Un-fucking-believable.
[462:06.62]Whatever.
[462:09.12]Uh, thank you for the comment about me being jacked.
[462:11.70]No, I appreciate that, expert.
[462:16.32]You spent ten minutes ranting about boogers, so it's spot on.
[462:18.64]That's not toilet.
[462:19.68]That's nasal.
[462:21.38]There's nothing to do with a toilet.
[462:26.00]What does cleaning out your nostrils have to do with a toilet?
[462:32.74]Just look at how fucking big I am and just forget about it.
[462:37.96]The Siphon, thanks for the $1.
[462:39.56]I never watch the streams live due to time zones, but there's always the VOD.
[462:44.66]Anyways, finally able to give you some bits.
[462:48.83]Thank you, Siphon, for the dollar.
[462:50.37]I appreciate it.
[462:52.11]And yeah, time zones are tricky, especially now that I'm on Pacific time.
[462:56.89]Changing to PST has made me like 8 to 10 hours behind a ton of people that are in Europe.
[463:03.68]And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
[463:08.72]The nose is the ass of the face.
[463:15.23]Oh, no, I'd say your mouth is.
[463:18.79]No, your mouth is.
[463:20.03]How many times have you, like, coughed up phlegm or, like, puked?
[463:24.51]You don't puke out your nose.
[463:25.49]It's your mouth.
[463:34.60]Sneeze?
[463:35.10]Yeah, that, like...
[463:37.80]You don't shit out of your mouth.
[463:39.14]You don't shit out of your nose either.
[463:42.66]You don't shit... Alright.
[463:45.28]Thank you.
[463:46.31]Thank you for that conversation.
[463:49.61]Uh, thank you nut...
[463:53.54]on whatever the rest of your name is thanks for the one dollar I tried to write a 17 page essay on the life of jeremy albertson but it only came out to be it's a short joke if they're making a reference of how I'm five foot four but that's not true I am five foot eight and it is just absolutely untrue so I hate to say anything about this but you're just wrong uh they said it came out to be five foot four inches
[464:24.80]I was going to scream in the mic.
[464:26.24]Did you fucking see how good I look?
[464:31.86]Dork Cube, thanks for the $2.50, Dork Cube.
[464:34.28]Well, I missed most of the stream, but that's okay.
[464:35.94]I've got to play Smash Brothers with my brother instead.
[464:38.50]Always great to play games with people you haven't seen in a while.
[464:41.24]That's true.
[464:43.44]That is very true.
[464:45.87]When you get to hang out and play with people you haven't seen or played stuff with in a long time, it's a great experience and it kind of brings you back to all the other times you did before.
[464:54.47]So, that's much more important than this stream.
[464:57.08]So, thank you for the $2.50.
[464:59.64]And I hope you enjoyed Smash Brothers with your brother.
[465:03.42]Smash Brothers with your brother.
[465:09.28]Hey, Garfield, the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.

[465:17.27]Anyways, top 12 Garfield TV specials video was released recently.
[465:20.45]Garfield Babes and Bullets won first place if you were curious.
[465:23.85]It was the film noir genre piece I did where I got to work with a wonderful actress in my love interest.
[465:28.68]Very good special.
[465:29.28]Look it up.
[465:29.60]Check it out.
[465:30.00]Give it a Garfish.

[465:32.90]even though I already did so congratulations Garfield and thanks for the one dollar and thank you for the hope your production went well German is interesting he has a massive ego but it's physically compact like a Mini Cooper and how many miles to the gallon does a Mini Cooper get
[466:02.40]What's that one of the best miles to the gallon that you can possibly get in a car?
[466:08.49]Are you shitting me?
[466:11.13]Who cares?
[466:15.41]You know, you're right.
[466:16.69]Mod that guy.
[466:21.92]Hey, Ragnoy, thanks for the $2.
[466:25.60]Jesus Christ, I went to bed more than seven hours ago.
[466:27.66]How are you still on?
[466:28.48]We're just hanging out, having a good time.
[466:32.08]I don't have a timeframe for streams.
[466:34.90]Some streams go for four and a half hours, some streams go for eight to ten.
[466:39.60]You know, it just depends on what's going on.
[466:43.46]Don't talk about mileage.
[466:44.36]We saw you get tired from 30 minutes in Beat Saber.
[466:49.40]I've been doing... I played VR for six straight hours.
[466:56.78]Okay?
[466:57.80]I was standing up there moving my fucking arms around like an asshole for six hours.
[467:03.80]Now what?
[467:04.14]I'm not allowed to get winded?
[467:06.96]With lasers shooting into both eyes and swinging and having to be incredibly focused and moving around.
[467:13.76]Come on.
[467:16.69]What do we know?
[467:19.87]Just wait till I do the next VR stream.
[467:22.21]I'm getting it.
[467:24.13]Most people play VR for 12 hours at a time.
[467:26.05]That's not true.
[467:26.61]No way.
[467:27.63]They play VR for 12 hours at a time.
[467:30.40]12 hours straight of VR.
[467:33.36]And you guys have done that.
[467:34.76]You guys have decided that that was something you were going to do?
[467:44.80]I play for... Somebody just said... Kaiju Guts.
[467:47.90]I play for like 30 minutes.
[467:51.02]Hey, did you get like winded?
[467:55.91]How dare you get winded?
[468:04.29]Fuck.
[468:17.45]Okay.
[468:22.15]I saw something going on in the camera and I fucking immediately corrected myself.
[468:32.12]No, I didn't drool or nothing.
[468:33.88]Welcome to the stream.
[468:37.29]Have a good day.
[468:38.79]Okay.
[468:40.55]Kaiju Guts, speaking of intelligent, incredibly intelligent, fantastic people with fucking brainpower the size of a goddamn skyscraper.
[468:48.92]Thank you for the $2.
[468:52.06]And they say, chat may not like it, but this is what peak gamer performance looks like.
[468:57.72]This is the idle gamer body.
[469:10.47]No, no, no, no, no.
[469:12.02]Is this real?
[469:13.32]I think this is real.
[469:14.00]This is real.
[469:21.60]Take a look at this.
[469:32.87]So...
[469:34.24]Here we are.
[469:35.96]750 people at recording of this video.
[469:38.28]Subscribe to the channel.
[469:41.95]I have nothing to say besides thank you so much.
[469:44.05]I was supposed to do this at 500, but as you can see, it's a little too late for that.
[469:48.07]I can't really do that now.
[469:50.19]So here it is for 500 subscribers.
[469:54.01]Even though it's way past that now.
[469:56.02]Here you go.
[469:57.80]It's time to get fucking huge.
[470:01.16]These are bicep curls, baby.
[470:04.92]Whoa I'm wearing the same exact outfit
[470:34.60]Leave me alone.
[470:36.46]Hey, what's going on guys?
[470:39.90]Why is this playing?
[470:41.90]Okay.
[470:50.00]How's the shirt still- I- I- That's proof that I have never changed.
[470:55.68]Oh, Jeremy, maybe you- Maybe Jeremy's changed.
[470:58.96]Oh, really?
[470:59.44]Because in 2012, I made that video.
[471:02.04]I'm wearing the same fucking shirt.
[471:04.93]This is the same shirt.
[471:09.29]And it stinks.
[471:10.51]I haven't washed it.
[471:15.65]I never changed clothes.
[471:17.33]What is he, naked?
[471:18.61]I've never taken this off.
[471:28.66]What's the oldest piece of clothing I have?
[471:29.88]I don't know.
[471:32.06]Probably this, because I just saw it on me again six years ago.
[471:38.48]Anyways, let's, uh, when we're done with the bits, let's keep going.
[471:41.94]Thank you, Kaiju Guts, for the two bucks and that video.
[471:47.19]Uh, Adam Trap, that was actually with 35 pound dumbbells.
[471:49.69]I was a fucking monster.
[471:52.13]Back in my prime.
[471:56.87]But thank you.
[471:57.53]Thank you Adam Trapp for the $1.
[471:59.51]I love you, Jerma.
[472:00.37]Thank you for the $1.
[472:01.38]And thank you for the kind words.
[472:06.74]Yaddington, thanks for the $1.
[472:08.08]Jerma, there's a burger place in my town that serves burgers with bananas on them.
[472:13.40]I mean... I'm not sure that's completely un... I almost just threw up.
[472:18.83]Completely unusual for, you know, hamburgers.
[472:22.21]That's fine.
[472:23.41]Got salty, got sweet.
[472:24.97]That works.
[472:26.93]Hey, Pigeon, thanks for the $2.20.
[472:29.67]Didn't expect you to read it on stream, much less devote so much time to Lilo me.
[472:35.56]There's something to say about the way I feel when you read a comment, but I could write another paper on how it feels when you read an entire seven-page paper.
[472:44.40]Though I probably couldn't because the feeling is nothing more than pure ecstasy and euphoria.

[475:16.25]There ain't nothing on there.
[475:19.92]Uhhhhhhh... Full Metal Alchemist is a great show.
[475:22.48]Regardless if it's an anime, which people would be if you say that word and all of a sudden they put up like a whole like a fucking cross.
[475:29.84]Oh yeah, it's uh, well the thing is it's an anime.
[475:32.70]Get back, back it up, back up!

[475:52.34]It's your boy, Max B. What's going on?
[475:55.00]Just checking on you.
[475:55.72]Appreciate the love and support.
[475:57.30]The wave is here.

[476:00.36]So you already know.
[476:01.10]Ain't no problem, man.
[476:02.26]The game, you already know how the game does.
[476:04.60]Do your wave, Shido.
[476:05.68]You got the official wave, man.
[476:07.06]Just... What am I reading?
[476:12.15]Just doing you, doing you, doing your wave and keep it loopy.
[476:14.51]I know you're gonna keep it loopy.
[476:18.15]Was that just a Rick and Morty piece?
[476:19.56]I feel like Justin Roiland says that out loud in an episode.
[476:25.34]Does he?
[476:35.95]Niall Orion, thanks for the three.
[476:37.85]Well, that would be six.
[476:38.81]Three dollars.
[476:41.47]I had my first Germo laugh where it felt like I was dying the other day.
[476:44.17]It was a great feeling to just accept your death and not be able to stop.
[476:51.14]The last time that happened, I really almost- I almost blacked out during that Sims stream.
[476:55.02]That's the last time it really happened.
[476:57.68]The world was closing in, I was blacking out.
[477:01.36]God, don't you wish you could just fucking delete that.
[477:03.51]Just eternal sunshine that from my memory and just go do that again.
[477:07.85]God, that was the funniest thing I've fucking ever seen.
[477:12.33]Uh, but thank you.
[477:13.89]Thank you so much.
[477:14.97]Thank you something or other for the $2.50.
[477:16.09]$2.50.
[477:16.41]Yo, Germs, thanks for being such a funny streamer guy while also working on assets.
[477:21.20]Oh, I thought you meant, like, I had assets.
[477:23.04]No.
[477:23.82]Yo, Germs, thanks for being such a funny streamer guy while I'm working on assets.
[477:28.78]It's a good backdrop.
[477:30.38]On a different note, what's your favorite PlayStation 2 title?
[477:39.13]Monster... No, that was PlayStation 1.
[477:45.71]Hmm.
[477:49.03]I don't know.
[477:50.19]There's too many.
[477:53.85]The Logan Brothers was Dreamcast, so... What's the best PlayStation 2 game?
[478:03.18]Resident Evil 4?
[478:04.04]But that was an original GameCube game, wasn't it?
[478:06.44]Wasn't it GameCube?
[478:18.00]I got a long neck now.
[478:20.53]And a small head.
[478:21.29]I'm like the guy... whatever.
[478:24.65]Uh, probably, uh, Lifeline.
[478:28.17]Thank you, Rag.
[478:29.17]Our annoy for the two bucks really went downhill, huh?
[478:35.37]No, I didn't.
[478:40.71]I got news for you guys.
[478:44.35]That was from 2012.
[478:45.17]13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[478:45.61]That was seven fucking years ago.
[478:48.12]Seven years ago.
[478:58.30]What kind of miracle ointment have I been swallowing?
[479:00.50]You know what I mean?
[479:01.14]To still look a little worse.
[479:03.86]Like a lot worse.
[479:06.53]I don't like my tooth right there.
[479:07.89]I got like my eyes look a little darker.
[479:10.53]My hair is kind of thinning.
[479:14.89]No, I'm looking like a little worse.
[479:16.11]It was 2011.
[479:21.04]Yeah.
[479:21.16]Yeah.
[479:24.95]Counting with his fingers.
[479:25.91]I just thought I was doing that for dramatic effect.
[479:33.17]Why can't I do that?
[479:35.80]Now the bones in my hand don't even work.
[479:39.84]Get a short haircut again?
[479:40.82]I will not.
[479:42.44]I like this.
[479:43.80]I like the way it sits.
[479:47.23]Hey, we're almost done here.
[479:48.09]Thank you to Ragnor... Ragnor... Ragnorose.
[479:51.98]Ragnor... For the two bucks.
[479:55.32]Ragnorose.
[479:55.94]That's not your name.
[479:57.90]Nut.
[479:59.80]Thank you for the one dollar, Nut.
[480:00.72]The most physically demanding thing you've done in two years was cut and fold cardboard into toys.
[480:06.76]That's not true.
[480:08.86]I've ran.
[480:09.28]A few times.
[480:11.22]This is what I was talking about at the beginning of the stream.
[480:16.87]Uh, thank you, AbortionShark, for the $1.29.
[480:19.93]I remember a while ago you were talking about raising the bit minimum to the price of a McChicken.
[480:23.65]Is that true?
[480:25.13]It happened.
[480:27.06]And at any moment during one of these streams, I'm going to stop doing it.
[480:33.24]Why do I have such a problem saying nut on... What about, like, newton?
[480:37.92]Alright, that's good.
[480:41.78]I get a solution to this.
[480:43.58]Uh, newton...
[480:46.01]Newton... Me Lipes.
[480:49.67]Thank you.
[480:50.07]Newton Me Lipes.
[480:51.24]Thanks for the $1.
[480:51.72]Really appreciate it.
[481:01.21]Yes, the $2.50 is the new reading minimum.
[481:04.95]But I've not started to enforce it yet.
[481:07.91]Because I want people to know it's happening.
[481:10.77]And it's going to happen... It's probably tomorrow.
[481:15.02]If I'm honest.
[481:16.38]Tomorrow I'm probably going to stop reading $1 bit messages.
[481:19.86]So just be aware.
[481:22.71]Good morning from England.
[481:23.71]Good morning.
[481:24.53]What time is it?
[481:26.51]Oh shit, it's fucking late.
[481:27.59]I gotta get out of here.
[481:29.59]Thank you, Flugboy, for the $1.
[481:30.75]I hate to be this guy, but I'm in love with the game.
[481:33.51]But have you ever tried or do you like Apex Legends?
[481:37.44]I have not played it once.
[481:39.86]I don't really play VRs.
[481:45.57]Really at all.
[481:47.61]It seems fun.
[481:51.71]Cool.
[481:53.85]Shooter.
[481:58.27]I don't have very much interest.
[482:02.49]Come to BR and be a BR streamer?
[482:09.59]Everyone else is playing it.
[482:10.49]You don't have to.
[482:11.01]Yeah, but... No, I just don't... No.
[482:18.38]No.
[482:19.16]No Apex.
[482:21.94]I'd rather just do other stuff.
[482:25.16]But, thank you, though.
[482:26.32]Appreciate it.
[482:28.56]Oh, thank you two two two two two Abortion shark again for the dollar 29 also love your streams keep up the good work Also, why doesn't the keyboard on stream over screen have arrow keys?
[482:39.19]What are you talking about?
[483:12.29]How'd you see that?
[483:14.69]It's not a regular keyboard.
[483:16.57]That's a, that's a, it's a magical keyboard.
[483:19.46]What, you should be at, they're all J. You can't, how do you, we can't even see that.
[483:25.38]I'm covering it.
[483:30.70]But, I don't know, because it's a magical, uh, germa keyboard.
[483:34.68]That's why.
[483:37.38]What an eagle vision viewer.
[483:40.49]But thank you, Mr. Shark.
[483:43.09]Xfer, thanks for the three bucks.
[483:44.29]What dealer do you and Tom Brady go to to get your miracle ointment from?
[483:49.71]I don't know if that's a Tom Brady is a cheater joke and you also live in New England or you did and you moved.
[483:56.46]Is that like some kind of also some kind of cheater or something?
[483:59.20]I don't know what that is supposed to mean.
[484:00.26]Not even funny.
[484:00.90]Tom Brady, but a legendary fucking quarterback.
[484:07.61]Like he slathers the ointment and no, that's actually like Tom Brady's young and like handsome looking.
[484:18.42]Oh, right.
[484:19.56]Probably shouldn't have jumped to a conclusion like that, that quickly.
[484:28.08]Hey, Noby, thanks for the $3.33.
[484:29.18]Don't know if you saw this yet.
[484:31.68]I don't know.
[484:32.30]Let's find out if I've seen this yet.
[484:38.37]Am I on it?
[484:40.21]Am I standing on it?
[484:42.29]Am I starting?
[484:44.27]Let's put it on screen.
[484:56.70]Am I on it?
[484:59.38]Am I standing on it?
[485:00.88]Why doesn't it just go to the dentist?
[485:03.82]The hoverboard is frictionless.
[485:07.30]I don't like this.
[485:11.20]Steer with the jets on your hands.
[485:15.32]Am I on it?
[485:20.65]Am I standing on it?
[485:22.15]It's a Halloween sound effect.
[485:25.09]The hoverboard is frictionless.
[485:26.19]Should I watch him live?
[485:28.59]I don't like this.
[485:32.49]Steer with the jets on your hands.
[485:40.60]I should go to that stream?
[485:44.94]Nah, the stream's ending.
[485:45.88]Don't click on it.
[485:50.54]I did a lot of screaming with the VR stuff.
[485:52.44]That's why you gotta get out of that and take some breaks.
[485:58.27]I gotta watch those VR vods.
[485:59.67]That was so much fun.
[486:01.63]It is such a blast.
[486:02.87]What a joy that device really is.
[486:07.06]But thank you, Novi, for the $3.33.
[486:08.24]Dorkcube, thanks for $1.
[486:10.03]Imagine you met somebody named Greg.
[486:11.75]Something cracked over here.
[486:17.05]Why did I just run over?
[486:17.77]It's about... No, never mind.
[486:26.70]I thought there was like a... Something on me.
[486:30.40]I looked at the monitor.
[486:31.22]I thought there was something on my body.
[486:34.78]Germa Raid.
[486:35.68]Oh, whoa, look out.
[486:36.60]Here comes the Germa Raid.
[486:39.30]What the heck?
[486:41.06]What the heck?
[486:44.34]What were you streaming earlier?
[486:46.68]Oh, PlayStation 2?
[486:48.91]Me too.
[486:49.33]It's almost as if we're in the same person.
[486:53.43]Thank you, Dorkcube, for the $1.
[486:54.79]Imagine you met somebody named Greg and you said, nah, I think I'm going to call you Steve.
[486:58.13]That's the name I'm going to give you.
[486:59.17]That's what you're doing to Newton Me Lipes.
[487:05.35]No.
[487:06.35]That would be like somebody introducing themselves as... Hey, my name is Nut on... You know what I mean?
[487:17.65]That's not like Dave.
[487:29.83]I think the Dreamcast broke him?
[487:31.33]What are you talking about?
[487:33.25]I'm better than ever.
[487:34.79]I'm more locked in than ever.
[487:36.65]Hey, thank you, AbortionShark, right at the end here for $1.29.
[487:45.38]Sorry for bashing it on the stream over screen, but it's zoomed in.
[487:49.82]Ooh, it is.
[487:56.66]Thank you.
[487:59.81]What's going on?
[488:00.79]Fix.
[488:03.45]Fix.
[488:09.52]There we go.
[488:11.52]And thank you, Newton, for the $1 stream.
[488:13.54]It gives a viewer a government name on Twitch.
[488:15.86]What do you mean, government name?
[488:20.56]Yes, it's online.
[488:21.20]Thanks for the $1.
[488:21.88]God damn it.
[488:22.50]Why do you think, God damn it?

[488:31.27]Did you wait?
[488:31.61]You didn't give any money.
[488:35.98]That was a fucking joke.
[488:37.62]Don't hold that to me.
[488:39.08]That was a joke.
[488:42.73]I was making a joke.
[488:46.39]You clearly didn't pay for that.
[488:54.95]500 subs, man.
[488:55.23]This video has 48,000 views.

[491:46.61]Please give me some tips.
[491:53.98]Uh... Is that a poke to me?
[492:07.04]Is that some kind of gesture to me?
[492:11.39]You're making that comment to me?
[492:15.89]I'll have you know when I had my profile on HotOrNot.com, 14 years ago, that was a 7.6.
[492:23.21]So, that second part, I'm not sure I agree with you.
[492:40.31]Please don't cry.
[492:45.80]Out of what?
[492:49.48]I'm going to have so much cheese.
[492:52.36]I'm going to have chicken.
[492:53.24]I got a chicken and cheese shepherd's pie waiting downstairs.
[492:58.38]I can't wait.
[493:06.01]Hey, thank you.
[493:07.11]I almost said that one.
[493:09.85]Not going to say it.
[493:12.18]That sounds good.
[493:12.68]Cheese and chicken, shepherd's pie.
[493:14.50]Some carrots.
[493:15.46]Some celery.
[493:18.13]What's it like being microscopic?
[493:19.31]I say that because you are short.
[493:21.59]It's actually pretty great.
[493:22.77]I don't have to duck to go through doorways.
[493:24.81]I can fit in any car.
[493:25.83]I can fit in any seat.
[493:29.47]What would be an uncomfortable train ride for somebody?
[493:32.25]On the subway, I fit anywhere.
[493:34.05]I can stick myself in a corner and just be completely comfortable.
[493:39.06]It's really easy to sleep.
[493:40.26]I can sleep anywhere.
[493:43.46]You know, if you've got a couch, I can curl up on that couch and I can sleep in any position.
[493:48.50]Sorry, some of you guys have to sleep in like a full bed.
[493:50.39]I live longer.
[494:00.45]I got smaller organs.
[494:03.22]Less work that my body has to do.
[494:04.76]I'm going to live longer.
[494:11.11]Does being short make your dong look bigger and make ladies like you more?
[494:14.88]It doesn't have to look bigger.
