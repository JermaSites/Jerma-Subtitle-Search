[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.71]I'm gonna open Viscera.
[00:05.43]Viscera got a new level.
[00:07.07]Did it really?
[00:15.08]Okay, so... AMID EVIL.
[00:19.16]We are probably gonna... We're gonna stop here from AMID EVIL.
[00:22.65]We're gonna move on to Viscera Cleanup.
[00:23.89]But I like this game.
[00:26.37]You will probably end up seeing this game again.
[00:30.28]No, Viscera... Viscera was pretty fun, but I don't think... I fucked it up.
[00:33.96]I said the wrong game.
[00:34.90]I was trying to do like... Never mind.
[00:36.34]Fuck it.
[00:36.62]I just said the wrong thing.
[00:39.98]I was going to say like... Pretend it's been like two weeks and I'm never playing this game again.
[00:44.37]I said the wrong game.
[00:45.59]Just pretend like I made something funny happen.
[00:58.35]I was trying to get the music queued up, too.
[01:00.77]Oh well.
[01:03.83]Alright, we're gonna play Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[01:05.65]Merry Christmas, everybody.
[01:10.97]What's the new level called?
[01:11.91]I already did the Christmas level.
[01:21.84]Do I even have this game installed?
[01:22.94]I do.
[01:25.10]Is it just on the base, Viscera Cleanup Detail?
[01:40.24]Or do I have to buy it?
[01:41.54]Do I actually have to buy it?
[01:42.90]What's it called?
[01:43.42]Here, let's put the BRB on for you.
[01:48.59]It's like DLC.
[01:56.61]Oh, okay.
[02:02.75]Would it be on a DLC?
[02:03.93]House of Horror, The Vulcan Affair.
[02:08.19]I've already... I've done this.
[02:15.66]Is it a separate video game, not DLC?
[02:22.60]It's not called Visceral Cubes.
[02:26.42]Have you done The Vulcan Affair?
[02:27.62]I don't even remember.
[02:30.98]Have I?
[02:32.46]What is The Vulcan Affair?
[02:41.52]They're just debating you.
[02:44.62]Alright, well fuck it.
[02:45.24]We'll just open up one of them.
[02:51.40]I'm so excited for the stream.
[02:55.20]I don't think I've done the Vulcan Affair.
[02:57.86]How big is this one?
[03:07.29]It's spy themed?
[03:12.43]This is the newest one.
[03:16.41]Alright, fucking whatever, I'll try it.
[03:21.89]Your account already owns this game.
[03:24.10]Oh.
[03:26.28]How?
[03:28.54]What?
[03:33.30]I don't have it listed here.
[03:38.40]I don't own this.
[03:44.19]You already own this game.
[03:48.53]What?
[03:52.87]It's not in my library.
[03:57.72]Viscera Cleanup Details, Santa's Rampage, and then Shadow Warrior.
[04:00.48]I don't have this.
[04:11.04]It's just DLC on the base game.
[04:15.35]Oh.
[04:16.57]Let's just open it.
[04:20.48]Should I launch 64-bit or just play it normally?
[04:23.12]I haven't played this in a long time.
[04:27.98]I don't remember.
[04:28.42]Alright, let's go.
[04:42.71]Hey, and the title doesn't even need to change.
[04:44.59]That still makes sense.
[05:00.24]Alright, hold on.

[05:57.94]Okay.
[05:59.00]Oh, I think it crashed.
[06:03.82]Did it?
[06:06.53]Yeah.
[06:11.29]Too many expensive particles.

[07:05.36]No.
[07:06.20]Why would I be in the YouTube Rewind?
[07:11.16]Okay.
[07:12.14]Company bids you welcome to this dump or whatever.
[07:15.88]Alright.
[07:16.18]Wait, wait, wait.
[07:18.32]You mission, should you choose to accept it - well you have no choice but to accept it or face severe disciplinary measures.
[07:23.00]Understood.
[07:24.00]Now then, this sprawling facility in various accessible areas are to be rendered clean and re-habitable.
[07:30.00]As always, once decontaminated and cleared you are to ignore and forget any details regarding the incident.
[07:35.00]The multitude of nations that may not be connected with the events uh... would you just clean up?
[07:40.00]Finally considering the nature of the operations and work, it's advisable to proceed with caution.
[07:45.00]Certain devices and systems remain operable.
[07:48.15]Well, that's a 10 million DPI.
[07:50.72]Okay.
[07:58.86]Alright.
[08:02.32]So, those of you who don't know how to play Viscera Cleanup Detail, it goes like this.

[17:40.64]Two?
[17:42.16]Probably two or three.
[17:50.49]Three, yeah.
[17:52.35]Go in the water.

[17:54.11]That's death.

[18:02.31]Yeah, no, this chair is junk.

[18:39.58]No.
[18:40.26]Trash.
[18:46.50]What's the dirtiest level in this whole game?
[18:49.16]Anybody know?
[18:53.78]What's like the bloodiest dirtiest level?
[19:02.13]How did I knock that over?
[19:03.05]I wasn't even near it.
[19:04.17]Like, honestly, next level spill joke.
[19:07.05]I wasn't even there.
[19:09.98]It fell behind me.

[19:17.90]R?
[19:18.48]E?
[19:19.00]T?
[19:21.58]How do you do it?

[20:03.63]There's no reason for face cam.
[20:07.30]No, you're not.
[20:07.84]I'm not doing it.
[20:08.58]No, I refuse.
[20:09.30]No, no, no.
[20:13.05]Alright, hold on.
[20:21.69]Eat that guy.
[20:23.41]Bring my trash receptacle over here, please.
[20:36.43]One by one.
[20:37.59]I wish that... Can I just sweep these into the... Can I do that?
[20:41.71]Can I do that?
[20:42.19]Yes, I can.
[20:51.94]That's a... I'm just painting.
[20:55.28]No, that's... Just do it.
[20:56.66]Just do it.
[21:14.88]What do we got?
[21:15.90]This thing is filthy.
[21:19.22]Is it time to dump?
[21:21.46]Very soon here it will be.
[21:39.07]Time to dump, yeah.
[21:40.19]Yeah, it's time to jump.
[21:58.62]Good!
[22:04.57]Uhhh... Dump it.
[22:13.37]I know, I'm gonna mop it all up later.
[22:15.01]I should've done this first.
[22:22.30]Facecam fortress.
[22:24.72]That's an old one.
[22:28.78]Are these even open?
[22:35.77]I don't think they are.
[22:52.01]Did you just tear your teeth?
[22:55.71]No.
[22:56.67]No, I don't like my teeth lately.
[22:58.59]Not lately.
[23:07.35]I mean, they're clean.
[23:09.45]But they're not... They're not sparkling clean, and I don't like that.
[23:12.83]I have to go back.
[23:14.59]I gotta get a cleaning or something.
[23:18.20]They're green.
[23:19.06]They're like dark green.
[23:22.40]They're a clean green, but they're not... They're not, like, sparkling white, you know?
[23:33.42]Look at this air.
[23:37.60]How long has it been since what?
[23:40.44]How long since what been?
[23:41.30]Alright, now let's get the mop in here, so everything's cleared out, right?
[23:44.89]Nothing else on the ground, right?
[23:54.96]I don't care about this.
[23:58.88]Dr. Moreau.
[24:00.25]Oh, I can't.
[24:00.71]Somebody screenshot that and read it later.
[24:04.05]These are both locked.
[24:06.75]Can I just pick up the whole thing?
[24:08.31]Here, watch.
[24:08.83]Ready?
[24:13.07]That didn't work the way that I wanted it to.
[24:15.21]But what if we're throwing this away anyways?
[24:24.23]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[24:26.15]Almost there.
[24:29.85]Looks alright.
[24:31.69]Bring a couple buckets.
[24:40.28]Can I dunk my feet in there if I step in anything?
[24:52.73]I didn't fuck this up last time, so... Baldi's Basics?
[24:56.25]I've never even played that game, and I know what that is.
[25:25.68]Why do I know that?
[25:31.12]Why do I know that?
[25:32.41]I've never even seen anybody play that game.
[25:42.05]Why do I know that?
[25:49.24]It's only because of the... In this song.
[25:54.34]That's why I'm thinking about that.
[26:05.10]Alright, we're almost done.
[26:06.08]This fucking level was easy.
[26:21.86]Fuck.
[26:27.35]No, it's the FOV.
[26:28.35]It's not small enough.
[26:30.15]Whatever.
[26:38.53]Yeah, there's- there's some- uh... Gotta sweep sweep sweep!
[26:39.77]Why do I know this?!
[26:40.17]I shouldn't know this!
[26:40.65]I've never fucking played this and I've never seen it- I've seen the intro screen!
[26:42.48]Gotta sweep sweep sweep!

[26:54.56]I- Did I play this in my sleep?
[27:01.72]And there's another character that goes... like...
[27:05.98]Heyyyyy, I... Did I?
[27:10.40]No, I didn't.
[27:18.90]I did not stream this game.
[27:20.14]No, I did not.
[27:20.68]Give me a clip.
[27:21.28]I don't believe you.
[27:26.93]No fucking way.
[27:32.71]You did.
[27:35.58]No, I didn't.
[27:36.94]No, I did not.
[27:37.74]Okay, I need another... Just rig him.
[27:55.02]Wake up.
[27:57.94]I don't want to wake up.
[28:00.65]I want to stay here.
[28:06.67]So this is just part one of, like, ten, right?
[28:09.01]In this level.
[28:18.24]Look at the clip.
[28:19.56]Nobody linked anything?
[28:23.00]I'm getting gaslit by my own community.
[28:31.77]I know I didn't play it.
[28:37.42]Why'd you leave the keys on the table?
[28:41.28]Well, you made the video.
[28:45.46]What the fuck are you talking about?
[28:46.90]Hold on.
[28:48.97]Wait, I need to save this, because what if it breaks?
[28:53.53]Oh, shit!
[28:54.21]Lookit, I have stuff!
[28:57.65]Five and a half hours?
[29:07.79]What is this?
[29:09.82]I made this video.
[29:13.93]I'm gonna play the whole song.
[29:32.55]No, I'm not.
[29:34.03]I don't want to listen to that.
[29:36.19]I mean, it's a great song.
[29:37.19]It just is.
[29:42.34]But I don't want to play the whole thing.
[29:47.59]And that just messed up my frame rate.
[29:50.69]Sing the lyrics.
[30:01.46]You know the rules at Q-I-N.
[30:08.07]I need water.
[30:30.92]That stream was fucking ridiculous.
[30:39.35]I wake up screaming sometimes because of that stream.
[30:44.99]No, no, it's not real!
[30:46.79]Oh, it was.
[31:10.31]That string killed me.
[31:14.11]Me too!
[31:14.57]Alright, only a couple more pieces of fresh, and that's it!
[31:24.53]And I beat it.
[31:25.70]It was pretty cool.
[31:27.18]It was a pretty good level.
[31:30.74]Nice and clean.
[31:32.04]Here, have some cigarettes.
[31:38.20]Looks good.
[31:39.40]Looks good.
[31:40.20]This room looks good.
[31:41.08]Good!
[31:42.22]Good.
[31:43.79]Good.
[31:45.35]Good.
[31:46.95]Good.
[31:47.53]Alright, there's a dirty monitor.
[32:02.84]Get in there.
[32:09.24]This is the longest YouTube video?
[32:10.92]What do you mean?
[32:11.26]What are you talking about?
[32:11.98]A YouTube video?
[32:21.28]A monitor lizard?
[32:23.80]Cool.
[32:28.68]I didn't know you guys were talking about an S-tier animal.
[32:36.26]Ah.
[32:42.71]S tier, yeah.
[32:44.61]Mon or was it an S tier animal?
[32:45.95]We already know that.
[32:46.57]I've already done the tier list.
[32:49.03]Alright.
[32:53.44]Is this clean?
[32:59.86]It sure is.
[33:01.94]Wait.
[33:05.78]What's wrong?
[33:18.95]Where is it?
[33:21.36]Found it.
[33:40.94]What's today's date?
[33:42.74]Uh, December... 3rd.
[33:47.56]See?
[33:48.84]I do know some things.
[33:56.42]Cheating you, the scanner.
[33:57.78]It's part of the game.
[34:06.20]This looks pretty good.
[34:07.92]I would call this clean.
[34:10.48]Would you?
[34:10.78]I didn't have to put a cheat code in to get this into the game.
[34:16.78]Wait, there's something else here.
[34:21.70]Where is it?
[34:22.70]Under the bucket?
[34:39.21]Maybe it is the bucket.
[34:48.01]Is it?
[34:48.39]Is it?
[34:48.89]No, it's not the bucket.
[34:49.67]Look.
[34:51.01]It's right here.
[34:59.56]Oh well, you can't clean them all.
[35:03.60]So that room's done.
[35:04.36]Is it above?
[35:13.29]I don't see anything above.
[35:14.21]Alright, the bucket's out of here.
[35:18.58]It was the bucket.
[35:19.48]Yeah.
[35:24.47]We're good.
[35:24.85]Room clean.
[35:27.87]Don't spill.
[35:30.79]Okay.
[35:32.53]Now, let's just get rid of this.
[35:35.77]How are we looking over here?
[35:38.23]This room is pretty normal.
[35:41.16]There's an elevator to go down.
[35:42.47]There's an elevator to go down.
[35:44.91]There's an elevator to go down.
[35:46.57]That runs off the tongue really fun.
[35:56.40]Should I go down?
[35:57.04]Let me check these other floors.
[36:01.96]Alright, current floor.
[36:04.04]One.
[36:05.60]Two.
[36:06.44]Three.
[36:11.02]Let's go take a look.
[36:14.68]Let's go to 2.
[36:17.31]Am I on 2?
[36:17.71]Let's go to 1.
[36:28.01]Oh dear.
[36:38.46]This isn't even that messy though.
[36:42.91]That's not that messy Who is this?
[37:09.70]Is this massage chairs?
[37:11.28]Am I activating their massage chairs?
[37:26.54]Okay, it's dropping.
[37:39.56]Oh, yeah.
[37:40.72]Alright.
[37:47.63]Cool.
[37:48.55]So just put all trash here.
[37:51.86]Jump in.
[37:52.62]Nope.
[37:59.84]I'm testing the theory.
[38:04.82]See where it goes?
[38:06.44]It's going into the, um, the shark pit.
[38:11.31]I know where it's going.
[38:12.53]Alright, I can put them in there.
[38:22.98]I have one of those squares, too.
[38:27.13]Yeah, I don't even... Just get all trash ready.
[38:30.93]They have to be in the grey squares.
[38:32.29]Oh.
[38:33.70]Whatever, it's okay.
[38:34.22]I'll do it in a minute.
[38:37.16]Looks good.
[38:43.86]Just get it on a square.
[38:44.96]Uh, a coffee cup.
[38:47.81]Just get it on a square.
[38:51.37]Hats and shit.
[38:52.15]Just throw it away.
[39:04.14]Good.
[39:05.20]Good.
[39:07.06]Good.
[39:07.74]Wait.
[39:07.90]No, you go here.
[39:11.24]Is the chair of music playing out here?
[39:23.38]It's that easy.
[39:26.12]I'm gonna push-broom this stuff.
[39:29.28]It's dirty, I know, but I'm gonna mop later, so who cares.
[39:39.35]Into the hole.
[39:40.29]Nope.
[39:41.83]What?
[39:46.01]That's not far enough?
[39:48.51]Oh.
[40:06.65]This is a big brain, big brain place.
[40:08.61]Thank you.
[40:14.89]I want to go big brain school.
[40:29.94]Nice.
[40:35.13]Now, these are gonna have to be picked up individually, which is fine.
[40:37.92]Uh, drop this guy down.
[40:41.40]See ya.
[40:43.85]I wanna watch, though.
[41:04.26]Alright, this is starting to look alright.
[41:05.72]Just need to mop eventually.
[41:07.40]Can I get a broom?
[41:09.10]Wait, hold on.
[41:10.32]This one doesn't drop.
[41:16.00]This one does.
[41:17.64]Jump, please.
[41:18.34]I am...
[41:33.21]Oh, hello!
[41:34.69]It's me, Brawling!
[41:36.81]I have a story to tell ya!
[41:44.92]I don't f- I didn't play it.
[41:47.18]I don't fuckin' know why.
[42:15.43]I'm not gonna stream fucking Baldi's Basics.
[42:22.21]I started with Hand Simulator and you guys told me, I can't believe you're playing the YouTuber game, but for some reason you'd like me to play Baldi's Basics.
[42:33.91]I want you to say that into the mirror.
[42:51.00]Looking pretty cleansed.
[43:02.69]I like how the trash receptacles are just really bright areas, right?
[43:05.03]What else we got?
[43:11.26]Alright, now I need to get some water up here.
[43:13.50]Where's this music coming from?
[43:16.64]Seriously.
[43:44.41]I would put this up there with like ocarina of time
[44:18.52]And you have to say Ocarina of Time, otherwise your list is invalid.
[44:22.36]The best games ever made.
[44:38.37]Am I ever going to play that monkey game again?
[44:40.31]No.
[44:42.07]No, I'm not.
[44:44.08]Don't... Ancient... What's it called?
[44:46.30]Ancient Ancestors?
[44:49.29]No, you will not see that game again.
[44:53.21]I do not think so.
[45:01.28]Come here.
[45:01.72]A lot of these random sh- I get that with a broom.
[45:11.84]Droppable.
[45:24.09]Where the fuck does he live?
[45:25.01]It's 4 o'clock in the morning for me.
[45:27.19]I live in the center of the Pacific Ocean.
[45:31.66]I'm currently on a submarine.
[45:47.53]Good.
[45:49.39]Where's the water?
[45:55.92]Water bucket, there it is.
[45:58.56]Alright, we're gonna work out.
[46:03.79]Bring the bucket in here, what are you, dumb?
[46:07.79]Put on the sub-cam.
[46:12.51]You guys do realize that's the next step for IRL streaming, right?
[46:19.41]Alright, we've been... I've been to every location on Earth.
[46:26.54]Now I'm going to stream myself getting into a space shuttle and going to the moon.
[46:40.44]Or Mars.
[46:41.28]I don't want to go to Mars.
[46:42.48]I'm going to stream the whole journey.
[46:55.89]They did that in the 60s already.
[47:01.73]Yeah, but... But it wasn't... But it wasn't my favorite streamer.
[47:06.67]So, whatever.
[47:08.01]I gotta get more buckets.
[47:19.59]Floor 1.
[47:20.33]I am on floor 1.
[47:32.08]I know you're gonna hate me for this, but I'm gonna bring, like, three up there.
[47:38.51]Somebody's gonna, in the chat, I can already read their comment, is gonna say, in all capitals, JUST FUCKING DO IT NORMALLY.
[47:45.46]GOD.
[47:52.40]I know, I've already read it.
[47:53.78]I can see it already.
[48:09.70]Okay, see?
[48:11.30]Not a problem.
[48:17.78]A little bounce there.
[48:21.58]God, do it fucking normally.
[48:29.29]We're gonna have to put our own OST on again.
[48:39.70]How about Baldi's Basics?
[48:43.88]Where am I?
[48:46.15]This one?
[49:07.63]That's the whole song?
[49:41.05]I thought it was longer than this.
[49:50.98]Home Depot theme?
[49:53.02]The Home Depot theme song.
[49:56.16]You guys, this is real?
[50:00.80]Oh, it's this thing.
[50:04.76]Less saving, more doing.
[50:07.06]That's the power of Home Depot.
[50:08.36]Now I know what you mean.
[50:22.45]This is all this song is, too.
[50:24.09]It's like eight seconds.
[50:27.86]This song is six... Not even.
[50:31.28]One.
[50:32.14]Two.
[50:33.12]Three.
[50:33.44]It's three seconds long.
[50:40.23]It's not even a song.
[50:43.19]It's just the end of the commercial after the guy says it.
[50:52.41]It's so stupid.
[50:53.61]It's growing on you?
[50:54.89]You can't be copywritten if it's only three seconds long.
[50:59.67]Oh, it's because I'm hearing this music too.
[51:27.50]I can't, I can't fucking do this anymore.
[51:31.30]This is actually terrible.
[51:32.60]I mean, it's fine for a 15 second ad for the Super Bowl, but not right now.
[51:46.45]I have to stop this.
[52:01.91]Lowe's doesn't have one.
[52:05.61]Huh.
[52:07.34]That's unfortunate.
[52:12.56]How about, um... Allstate?
[52:19.31]How it's made.
[52:19.89]We've done that already.
[52:23.45]How about... We need cleaning music.
[52:26.09]Music to clean to.
[52:28.95]This doesn't have to be like a playlist.
[52:30.93]Catchy songs to clean your room.
[52:33.68]One hour of cleaning music.
[52:35.62]Okay.
[53:04.91]So some teenager made that.
[53:09.88]Some teenager made that.
[53:11.90]And that's fine.
[53:13.80]It's cool.
[53:14.42]Let's see what they have on their playlist.
[53:18.78]Cool.
[53:19.98]What's next?
[53:21.04]Okay.
[53:21.44]What's the next one?
[53:31.24]We should start now.
[53:35.37]Wait, is this Coldplay?
[53:37.75]Okay, what's the next one?
[53:39.97]I think this is... I don't know.
[53:47.84]This one doesn't have a list.
[53:54.36]What's the next one?
[54:04.48]Because the search didn't have a song.
[54:07.92]And not a bad playlist.
[54:11.63]Some of those, I don't know what any of these are, actually.
[54:26.60]Why would I type this?
[54:28.94]Like I said before, this stream was an extra stream for the week, and you can tell that I just typed in... I typed in piano key mashing.
[54:39.26]Like I was gonna put that on?
[54:50.85]Nobody's made a video?
[54:52.73]I'm trying to find one.
[54:55.67]Okay, if you type in piano key mashing, nobody has like a... Why?
[55:08.41]Are you kidding me?
[55:10.08]How has nobody done this?
[55:13.30]There's like 600 trillion videos on YouTube, not one person made one?
[55:17.36]That's unbelievable to me.
[55:21.02]Hitting every key on piano.
[55:29.56]What is this?
[55:30.38]Fast piano key hitting?
[55:43.30]I could do that faster.
[55:44.20]I know I can.
[55:45.25]This is the fastest in the world?
[55:46.39]I can do faster than this.
[55:48.95]You guys know I can do that faster than this.
[55:53.57]Guinness World Record fastest hitting the piano keys in a minute.
[55:56.07]I can beat this.
[56:05.27]No, I can't believe nobody has a video where they just hit a bunch of keys and it's like a 15 minute long video.
[56:10.19]How?
[56:18.09]You guys got one?
[56:18.79]I found one.
[56:22.71]Did you actually find one?
[56:24.16]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[56:30.65]It's funny!
[56:35.57]Alright, who gives a shit?
[57:09.62]No, that's not it that's not whatever I'm done Just give me something normal to play This took five seconds to find what did you type in?
[57:30.89]Oh, yeah.
[57:31.95]Oh the stinky video.
[57:32.95]I'm not gonna trust you guys ever again What is this I can't put on like this music
[58:06.81]This is the cartoon music.
[58:18.00]Okay, I'm done.
[58:18.88]I'm actually done.
[58:24.42]I'm going for this one.
[58:25.82]I just need background music.
[58:27.24]That's all I need.
[58:34.16]This is just stress relief music.
[58:35.54]Sounds good to me.
[58:36.12]I gotta, like, continue playing the video game, guys.
[58:57.01]That's not even trash.
[59:11.31]Wait, you're a video game streamer now?
[59:14.75]Yes.
[59:19.28]I don't know what happened there.
[59:20.26]I know it's a push-pull, but still.
[59:21.48]Like, what happened?
[59:33.97]Drop it.
[59:35.87]The best thing is I can drop these too, right?
[59:38.33]Yes, I can.
[59:43.40]Drop.
[59:45.81]Drop.
[59:49.51]Get rid of him.
[59:58.13]Fuck.
[60:04.33]Just press every button, for God's sakes.
[60:20.87]Am I walking this around?
[60:22.13]No.
[60:23.67]Still have one bucket that's clean.
[60:25.69]Is this the same music that you played when you died?
[60:36.94]Is it?
[60:44.66]It is.
[60:50.61]Dude, I scrolled a long way.
[60:55.49]I scrolled pretty fucking far.
[60:57.42]That's so stupid.
[61:03.92]This is the music I played when I died.
[61:25.52]God damn it.
[61:30.16]Okay, I can do a little bit more cleanup.
[62:01.91]I have to use that device to... the shooter.
[62:05.81]This one's unlocked.
[62:12.66]Well, this is a mess.
[62:15.44]This is a mess.
[62:25.46]Just break a world record on stream.
[62:26.98]Do you know how hard that is to do?
[62:32.08]People train for months doing the same thing every day.
[62:36.32]And you want me to break a world record that I don't even know what record I'm going to break on stream.
[62:41.82]Just now.
[62:53.41]God, do it already.
[63:04.02]I better commit to what I'm built for You know you can't get this from any other guy
[63:51.40]5G noises.
[63:53.32]You don't want to play 5G noises?
[63:56.30]Fine.
[63:58.60]You guys are in trouble.
[63:59.58]You guys are on restriction right now.
[64:43.49]Okay, this thing is actually called chilling and relaxing to 60 cycle hump 12 hours of power line power line noise This is what I feel like I feel like it feels like Come on cell tower
[65:14.30]Sounds.
[65:15.02]Do they actually make sounds?
[65:23.55]No, I don't think they do.
[65:32.68]Alright, let's keep going.
[65:35.00]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let it go.
[65:36.28]Okay, bring this one over here.
[65:58.43]No, I'm not playing it.
[65:59.31]I'm not playing it.
[66:00.99]You're making that up in your head.
[66:04.33]There's no... I don't have any video on right now.
[66:07.43]You're making it up.
[66:11.70]You think you hear it, but it's not there.
[66:20.74]That's just the air conditioner in this room.
[66:28.38]Okay, let me... Dr. Phil.
[66:33.82]I'm not gonna put on Dr. Phil.
[66:36.60]Sorry.
[66:39.17]Maybe some other day.
[66:46.05]Let's get this over here.
[66:59.23]Play background crowd noises, like at a bar.
[67:04.92]How about crowd noises?
[67:19.31]Yeah, that's fine.
[67:30.05]Internet cafe, that's right.
[67:33.54]This is not the same one Do a Twitch con panel You wouldn't mean like right now
[68:04.16]Yes.
[68:10.93]It's not TwitchCon anymore.
[68:12.75]It hasn't been for a long time.
[68:22.21]I need to dunk this in the water without knocking anything over.
[68:24.45]Oh fuck.
[68:28.28]Okay.
[68:32.86]Do a headstart on next year's TwitchCon panel you're gonna do.
[68:41.57]I'm not gonna do a TwitchCon panel.
[68:51.96]What the hell would I even tell you guys?
[68:53.78]Or anybody?
[69:03.24]Dance?
[69:07.06]So if I was on a TwitchCon panel, what do TwitchCon panels talk about?
[69:18.43]I've never been to one.
[69:31.91]Weren't you there?
[69:32.73]I mean, I was at TwitchCon.
[69:33.71]I've never been to a TwitchCon panel.
[69:35.39]Imagine I had a TwitchCon panel.
[69:48.34]And... I just had, like, a dummy on the stage.
[69:53.11]And I was in a doctor's outfit.
[69:56.17]And I was just doing open-heart surgery to the dummy.
[70:08.48]And the name of the panel would be, I made a mistake, but I have to do this anyways.
[70:17.57]I made a scheduling mistake, but this guy needs a new heart, you know what I mean?
[70:25.48]So that's what I'm doing.
[70:34.11]Just have, like, ten people all in scrubs.
[70:39.31]Just, like, openly operating.
[70:43.77]And then randomly answer Q&A questions about Twitch.
[70:51.09]But just, you know, like, people come up with a microphone.
[70:57.48]So how did you get your start, uh, on Twitch?
[71:01.37]Well, uh... Hold on just a second.
[71:04.01]Yeah, I need a... Can we close that one, please?
[71:07.87]Save that up.
[71:08.27]Yep.
[71:08.95]Thank you.
[71:10.01]Well, I... Funny thing.
[71:12.33]I played Team Fortress 2.
[71:13.97]I made comedy videos.
[71:25.23]You have to do that now.
[71:26.83]Do you think that I would ever be allowed to do something like that?
[71:33.98]That's the type of scenario where you tell somebody that idea, and then they go, oh!
[71:40.70]Whoa, super cool, interesting idea.
[71:44.91]Let me throw some lines up.
[71:47.27]And yeah, cool though.
[71:49.55]Cool idea.
[71:50.41]And then they never talk to you again.
[71:55.25]That's how that works.
[72:12.27]Those aren't Twitch panels reserved for... Don't you have to actually talk about something?
[72:17.92]I feel like they wouldn't want me just to make a mockery of Twitch panels, right?
[72:23.15]I don't think they would want me to do that.
[72:37.64]Or do just... Just copy... Just copy Penn and Teller... And have a panel where it's... What's the name of their show?
[72:46.31]Like, fool us!
[72:48.69]And I get up there and I'm like, welcome to... Magician... I just bring like magicians on to like fool me?
[72:58.27]I have to try to figure out what they did?
[72:59.97]Yeah, they filmed that show in Vegas.
[73:17.25]And bring in, just bring in a bunch of really expensive looking fake cameras.
[73:23.35]And hire ten people to be fake production staff.
[73:26.65]Like, this is a real show that's on television, but all the cameras aren't even real.
[73:31.96]Like, nothing about it is real at all.
[73:39.20]People are going to come into the panel, into the hall, and they're going to look around and be like, holy shit, there's like fucking 10 cameras.
[73:44.14]There's like a guy on a crane.
[73:45.22]He's sitting, like Steven Spielberg style, sitting in the crane camera seat.
[73:50.75]The camera's made out of plastic.
[73:51.55]It's not real.
[74:05.56]Crane is also plastic.
[74:07.32]Well, I think that would be kind of dangerous.
[74:09.48]So, that would not be the case.
[74:17.38]And have 250 actors be the audience, and have one person actually in there that signed up for the panel.
[74:24.97]And people are treating it like it's a real thing.
[74:37.32]You know what actually would be kind of funny?
[74:40.66]Is to have a panel, but to actually do that.
[74:45.04]Have a bunch of people that are hired to be there.
[74:47.46]To just talk you up and say how awesome you are and ask a bunch of questions.
[74:52.90]And then never really talk about it, but like somehow it comes out that those were all fake paid people to be there.
[75:00.05]I would just look so bad and so fucked up.
[75:12.29]It would just look really awful.
[75:21.99]That's impractical jokers type shit.
[75:26.88]Yeah.
[75:29.90]Do a Reddit AMA?
[75:31.06]Yeah, do a Reddit AMA, but it's not even me doing the AMA.
[75:33.70]It's not even me.
[75:37.46]And like halfway, or like 75% of the way through that AMA, my channel goes live and I'm sleeping in my bed.
[75:47.95]And then the stream turns off after like two to three minutes.
[75:55.56]Nope, that ain't me talking.
[76:07.00]Two to three hours?
[76:08.36]Oh, I don't think I can do that.
[76:16.02]Or have an AMA, but have like ten accounts pretending to be me, and one of them is the real one, and we're all answering questions.
[76:22.78]One of those accounts is real.
[76:25.12]But you don't know which one.
[76:36.64]Alright, everything looks good.
[76:40.00]Except for this window that needs to be broken.
[76:43.90]Never mind.
[76:47.54]That's the accused stream, but in reverse.
[77:01.13]I would call this room clean, except for this one.
[77:07.88]There might be a couple of, uh... Oh, wait.
[77:11.00]Nope, never mind.
[77:11.68]I gotta get rid of all these bullet holes.
[77:23.98]Oh, here comes Spade Tornade.
[77:40.67]Oh, progress is being made on the Minecraft stream, by the way.
[77:46.33]That still should be good to go for the 15th.
[77:51.27]Depending on how long it takes the devs to put it all together.
[77:58.36]I will have a better answer soon.
[78:00.64]But it's looking like it's going to happen.
[78:03.38]This will probably happen at least in December.
[78:05.90]But we're still shooting for the 15th.
[78:12.16]So that should be fun.
[78:15.91]No, no, no.
[78:16.37]Not like the actual devs of Minecraft.
[78:18.29]Like the people that are making the server for all this to go down.
[78:24.07]And all the plugins and everything.
[78:25.20]Get them all in one go.
[78:30.10]Get them all in one go.
[78:30.68]Get them all in one go.
[78:56.60]I left one behind.
[78:57.43]Leaving one behind is fine.
[78:58.79]Leaving twelve behind is not.
[79:18.98]Hey, that's me!
[79:20.08]Who?
[79:21.00]Me!
[79:32.27]Alright, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[79:33.87]This would be the worst world in real life.
[79:43.19]Yeah, it's made out of strands of hair.
[79:45.71]Alright, that's good enough for now.
[79:55.82]Make a joke.
[79:59.68]What are you talking about?
[80:00.90]Make a joke.
[80:13.38]I'm not a Woody doll.
[80:16.74]You pull the back of- you pull my string and I just say something.
[80:37.90]There's buttons under here.
[80:39.64]I want to press them.
[80:40.52]How do I press these buttons?
[80:44.91]How do you crouch?
[80:45.47]What does that do?
[80:52.51]What the hell does that do?
[81:03.13]Oh, shit.
[81:03.61]5G, dude.
[81:04.19]5G.
[81:14.76]Dude, are you ready for 5G?
[81:23.43]I'm not.
[81:27.73]Which one is this?
[81:29.53]Is it this one?
[81:31.49]Okay, it's that one.
[81:47.20]What's that fucking noise?
[82:01.49]Press it!
[82:08.49]Press this button!
[82:14.73]I can't press this now?
[82:20.56]This only works one time.
[82:21.90]Are you kidding me?
[82:29.46]Crouch?
[82:30.63]Control.
[82:31.51]C. Space.
[82:33.73]Caps lock.
[82:34.31]Ship.
[82:34.55]What is crouch?
[82:35.87]Control.
[82:37.11]C. V. F. C. Control.
[82:49.62]There is no crouch.
[83:01.60]In the event of my escape, I am able to bring Puddlesworth with me.
[83:04.88]I expect all of you to attend to his requirements.
[83:15.03]You left your ring.
[83:28.45]That's a big ass ring.
[83:31.53]Caution.
[83:33.57]Caution.
[83:34.45]Submarine.
[83:35.41]See?
[83:35.67]I told you I live here.
[83:45.60]Did he get out?
[83:46.20]It's clean.
[84:00.70]Re-chat.
[84:01.60]Re-chat.
[84:02.52]Re-chat.
[84:04.08]It's a collar.
[84:04.90]Yeah, I know.
[84:05.78]Look.
[84:06.50]Here's the cat right here.
[84:18.95]There.
[84:19.81]See?
[84:27.08]Ah!
[84:37.04]No!
[84:37.92]No, I don't want to do that!
[84:41.02]I think they go.
[84:41.86]I did it again.
[84:54.04]Get on there.
[84:58.49]Fucking Ignotic, fucking Morgan, fucking stupid, fucking dumb, fucking dumb, fucking stupid fucking thing.
[85:12.14]This room is clean.
[85:14.44]Take a look.
[85:15.04]It's like nothing ever happened in here except for these two bloodstains.
[85:19.85]Pick them up.
[85:24.83]Fine.
[85:27.61]The bullet holes.
[85:29.31]I know.
[86:00.38]New viewer here.
[86:00.94]This guy's pretty cool.
[86:03.02]Hey, thanks.
[86:03.56]Welcome.
[86:09.86]Welcome to the channel.
[86:12.50]How come there's no Twitch preview for when somebody's new?
[86:16.26]Instead of a pre-roll ad, if you've never clicked on this channel before, instead of a 30-second pre-roll ad, why don't you get like a, Hey, my name's Jerma985.
[86:25.47]Welcome to the channel.
[86:26.93]And like a cut-up of a highlight of stuff.
[86:41.20]Crazy things happen here all the time.
[86:43.62]5G!
[86:44.76]5G, it hurts!
[86:47.62]But I also do real talks.
[86:49.64]And then it cuts to another one.
[86:51.17]And I'm talking about, like, real shit.
[87:12.95]I also- I also have a hernia.
[87:15.33]Why would I put that in my trailer?
[87:17.92]Just in case you didn't know, I have a hernia.
[87:20.90]Okay.
[87:22.76]Alright, what?
[87:23.56]Why do I have to know that?
[87:27.77]Oh, my ribcage is all fucked up.
[87:46.70]Just let him vent chat.
[87:50.99]That is the lore.
[87:58.19]I can't wait to... I don't even care if you guys don't want to see it.
[88:00.73]I'm gonna make it in front of the green screen channel trailer.
[88:07.49]Fuck.
[88:14.64]And who remembers this one?
[88:21.23]Hi, Jerma985 here.
[88:23.23]You might know me as the shpee guy.
[88:26.75]Cut to like, shpee, shpee, like me saying it like five times, but I'm so much more than that.
[88:40.59]Just last week, I broke the world record.
[88:43.06]I'm the current world record holder for clicking a single mouse button more times than anyone in five seconds.
[88:52.61]And then I'll whip my hand up over my mouth to kind of lean in, whisper, and be like, try to beat that one.
[89:11.04]I'm also the only person that's slapped themselves in the face very hard.
[89:16.31]Not on purpose.
[89:23.08]In fact, I'm probably more known for that than the carnival I did.
[89:30.79]And I'm gonna look right into the camera and be real fucking sad.
[89:33.57]Alright, it's clean.
[89:48.29]We're good.
[89:56.82]And then it's going to... The best part about... If you could actually have that... I have to fucking... Don't make me do this.
[90:10.22]Let's just make people think they're getting an ad on the stream.
[90:16.18]Is that against term service?
[90:19.01]It's just in the middle of my stream, just fucking... Boom!
[90:21.15]Play... Just have a pretend ad banner on it and have it play over the video.
[90:35.03]So it's like you're actually getting an ad on my stream, but it's just, it's pumped in.
[90:50.30]Imagine having an ad play on your stream.
[90:54.92]It's your own stream and it's talking about, hey, you should like stick around.
[91:00.46]And it's like, it's like six minutes.
[91:03.24]And then it cuts back, and I don't fucking say anything.
[91:05.20]I'm just, I'm, I, I, as if I continued playing where I left off, where I, you know, six minutes in the game has gone by.
[91:10.73]Oh, you guys got an ad.
[91:11.57]Oh, alright.
[91:15.55]Hold on to that one.
[91:16.25]You might see it.
[91:16.75]Alright, I'm done up here.
[91:25.59]Everything's clean, except for this rocket ship.
[91:34.60]That's just a YouTube.
[91:35.76]Yeah, I know.
[91:38.40]Press the button.
[91:45.16]This button?
[91:50.16]Press the button?
[92:01.17]Alright, next.
[92:02.33]Next room.
[92:06.68]Wait, Twitch staff is in here?
[92:07.86]Who on Twitch staff is in here?
[92:09.58]I should just make a bunch of fucking fake commercials and shit.
[92:17.26]What was that?
[92:27.35]Hey, commercials for like grills and shit that I apparently am endorsing that aren't real?
[92:38.32]Staff is here because you said you were gonna take a dump on your desk.
[92:49.01]Ah, fuck.
[92:51.03]Ow.
[93:03.13]being at Twitch headquarters, you get a lead.
[93:09.55]It says, hey, just made somebody stick around there for a while.
[93:13.00]This guy said he was going to take a dump on his desk.
[93:31.12]You're just sitting there with the stream open, just with your hand over your mouth, just like, okay, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[93:40.17]Your hand is just hovering over the, like, turn off stream.
[93:48.95]Okay, what else do I have to do?
[93:50.23]Let's go, I gotta go up a floor.
[93:51.51]His ribs are breaking.
[94:11.17]Streamer.
[94:11.95]Streamer removed from Twitch for threatening to take dump on desk.
[94:19.26]That's fucking so stupid.
[94:25.62]Career over.
[94:28.74]Please jump in the shark pit.
[94:29.92]Alright, I'll do it for you!
[94:31.34]I'm gonna do it for you!
[94:32.30]They're friendly.
[94:51.90]It's me!
[94:52.40]I'm back!
[94:53.72]Ooh, that didn't look good.
[94:59.93]I gotta go up a floor.
[95:07.09]I'm gonna get calls from the principal's office.
[95:08.83]I'm gonna get, like, a DM on, like, Twitter or something.
[95:16.04]Dude, who on Twitch staff?
[95:17.72]Andrew or something!
[95:18.74]Hey!
[95:19.32]You got time to chat!
[95:24.54]Uh... What's up?
[95:30.23]Hey, so, uh... We're going down.
[95:36.43]Wait, we're gonna go three.
[95:49.08]Where is this?
[95:56.13]Alright, this is not bad.
[95:58.07]Door control?
[96:00.99]Enter code.
[96:03.63]Oh no, I have to enter code.
[96:12.51]No, here's the really fun thing.
[96:14.47]Not even fun.
[96:15.33]Alright, so... Oh, ding ding!
[96:17.57]DM from Twitch staff.
[96:20.07]Oh no, no, oh boy.
[96:23.09]Hey, what's up?
[96:23.97]I'm sorry.
[96:24.85]I'm sorry about talking about shitting on my desk.
[96:27.41]It'll never happen again, I promise.
[96:28.67]That was really fucked up.
[96:31.21]Hey, dude.
[96:31.75]Just wanted to say congratulations on your four-year partner.
[96:38.49]Right.
[96:41.05]Right.
[96:41.61]I got you.
[96:45.39]Thanks.
[96:59.35]But now that you say... What are you talking about?
[97:03.17]Nothing.
[97:03.51]I didn't... Don't worry.
[97:04.49]I just... I'm, you know, Mr. Comedy Man.
[97:08.29]That's what I do.
[97:09.67]Hold on.
[97:09.93]Somebody's linked me a clip.
[97:12.00]Oh, don't click that.
[97:13.44]It's probably a virus.
[97:20.50]You know, there's not even a point.
[97:21.46]Just get... Just get him on the elevator.
[97:23.48]Who cares?
[97:25.03]Who cares how they're on the elevator?
[97:26.29]Just get him in.
[97:33.75]I got another message back.
[97:34.93]Yeah, I've reviewed this clip.
[97:38.81]I don't know what to say about this.
[97:44.41]Bring it all.
[98:02.82]All of it.
[98:03.32]All of it.
[98:03.80]All of it.
[98:05.58]Shit.
[98:06.76]What's in here?
[98:23.79]Uh...
[98:27.43]Okay.
[98:28.73]Do I open these?
[98:30.51]Say it.
[98:31.39]Say what?
[98:32.99]What would you say if you were really, really sort of tense and scared and there's a fucked up moment that's maybe about to happen?
[98:43.20]I don't know.
[98:45.33]Be like something.
[98:46.67]A tyrant.
[98:49.15]A tyrant.
[99:03.56]What would that thing be?
[99:06.14]What would you say?
[99:18.23]What am I doing?
[99:20.17]I'm just picking stuff up and moving it.
[99:21.37]Launch aborted.
[99:24.27]One second remaining.
[99:29.93]Alright, I can't do this yet.
[99:33.57]I need the code.
[99:34.13]What's the code?
[99:34.57]Just give it to me.
[99:34.95]I just want it.
[99:35.33]Just tell me what it is.
[100:01.94]I'll sit here all day.
[100:04.30]I don't care how long this takes.
[100:05.71]I'm waiting for someone to put the real one in.
[100:44.44]Why would I ever think that would be real?
[100:49.65]I mean, it's been in the chat so many times that I... How am I supposed to know that that's not... How am I supposed to know that?
[101:07.30]They are random.
[101:11.06]What?
[101:18.94]Makes a different sound?
[101:22.36]It was on the cat's collar.
[101:24.28]Thank you.
[101:24.60]Appreciate it.
[101:27.48]Thank you!
[101:27.88]Where's the elevator?
[101:43.49]Where's the elevator?
[101:44.11]How do I get out of here?
[101:51.83]Am I stuck in here?
[101:59.62]No, there it is.
[102:02.46]Oh, right!
[102:03.32]I fucking barricaded myself.
[102:07.26]Where is it?
[102:07.76]Two... Cat's collar.
[102:20.69]This is not even right.
[102:35.78]Blink screen when you do a right number.
[102:37.68]Oh, I'm already here.
[102:40.11]I don't want to see this.
[102:46.85]I don't want the cat's collar.
[102:55.90]Mr. Cuddlesworth.
[103:06.21]Wait!
[103:06.43]Is it on the back?
[103:23.69]No.
[103:24.31]Ow.
[103:24.59]How is this not spilled?
[103:26.11]These two have not spilled.
[103:28.45]That's almost impossible at this point.
[103:31.13]I sneeze next to one of these and they break.
[103:33.38]And they fall over.
[103:42.73]It does a green?
[103:43.57]It links green?
[103:45.32]Wait, alright, hold on.
[104:00.72]The second number's three.
[104:04.20]Second number and fifth number are three.
[104:20.13]Third number is seven.
[104:21.71]Fourth number is seven.
[104:24.51]Um, something... Wait, what?
[104:29.92]First number is eight.
[104:34.08]First number is eight?
[104:36.92]Three?
[104:37.40]No.
[104:40.19]Eight?
[104:41.63]Three?
[104:43.93]Eight, three, seven?
[104:46.28]eight three seven three nope eight three eight seven three three eight seven no it's eight three seven seven eight three seven seven eight no eight three
[105:17.20]8, 3, 7, 7, 3.
[105:20.03]Now what?
[105:21.99]7.
[105:26.81]What's unlocked?
[105:27.68]What did I do?
[105:29.34]Oh, shit.
[105:47.51]Can I launch this?
[105:59.74]Death ray is ready.
[106:00.86]Fire the weapon at Yellowstone.
[106:02.52]Um, okay.
[106:04.24]Where's the button to go?
[106:05.94]Fire the missile.
[106:10.58]How do you fire the missile?
[106:18.11]Do I have to, like, throw a match in here?
[106:29.32]Launch the... What?
[106:30.28]I'm... I'm... Launch the missile.
[106:31.64]What do you think I'm trying to look for?
[106:32.66]A way to launch it.
[106:34.96]Man.
[106:41.67]All the way from the ground floor?
[106:43.01]Okay, well, I want to launch this shit.
[106:47.33]Let's go.
[107:03.95]Alright.
[107:11.15]Blocked.
[107:13.05]Where the hell am I?
[107:15.46]What is all out here?
[107:16.70]This map is huge.
[107:19.88]There it is.
[107:20.24]Alright, here's the way to... How do I get this open?
[107:27.42]Jerma.
[107:28.26]I dot dot dot.
[107:40.89]Oh no.
[107:42.99]Alright, two?
[107:46.45]Two is the first number.
[107:48.44]This is- holy shit, do you see how long this code is?
[107:54.70]I have to write this down.
[108:00.69]Oh my fucking god.
[108:02.61]I gotta write it down.
[108:03.95]Two is the first number.
[108:12.49]two four no there's four in here there's a backspace yeah two one two four two three two five two six two seven two eight two one

[109:49.32]I wasn't paying attention, I wasn't paying attention, I wasn't paying attention, it's not the right one, I wasn't paying attention.
[109:53.74]What was that number?
[109:55.06]Two what?
[109:56.16]Two eight?
[109:59.41]Two eight three three.
[110:04.81]Five, three... Guys, I don't... I... Two, eight, three, three, five, three, seven... Nine... What's the last number?
[110:23.54]Six, seven... Eight?
[110:29.42]What's that?
[110:29.78]What's the last number?
[110:32.02]What's the last number?
[110:44.04]Nice.
[110:47.52]Am I going to miss the explosion?
[110:50.98]Wait.
[111:06.84]This map is so big.
[111:10.12]This is a huge map.
[111:13.68]This is so big.
[111:14.52]I'm not going to be doing this whole thing on stream.
[111:18.00]No, no.
[111:19.20]That's not going to happen.
[111:27.41]You're not meant to do it in one day.
[111:28.69]Yeah, I know.
[111:37.20]Frogman?
[111:38.94]Well, I'm interested.
[111:47.94]What's this?
[112:04.86]I would get so lost in here.
[112:07.88]I already am.
[112:08.64]It's a... giant... laser?
[112:26.39]Holy shit.
[112:28.05]Okay, so there's two...
[112:36.69]Target acquired.
[113:10.73]Alright, whatever.
[113:13.33]That's cool.
[113:19.79]Recharging, wait.
[113:24.69]Can I move it around?
[113:40.44]I lived on the moon.
[113:42.68]I'm sorry.
[113:45.96]Uh, I think I did it.
[113:51.24]You have 24 hours until it hits the Earth?
[113:54.10]I think I'll be fine.
[114:13.30]I'm supposed to be cleaning.
[114:16.24]This is too expansive.
[114:17.97]It's too expansive.
[114:26.09]I wanna launch this, though.
[114:30.17]How do I open this thing?
[114:48.16]That's the wrong one.
[114:51.00]So it's this one.
[114:54.04]How do I get you open?
[114:54.96]There's gotta be a way to get this open, right?
[115:03.67]This way?
[115:07.35]Baldi's waiting room.
[115:17.98]You're never going to see Baldi's basics on this stream, and I need to explain to you why.
[115:27.02]Can I just, like... No.
[115:33.75]Wait a minute, what are the tools?
[115:35.83]A beacon.
[115:51.06]Well, I don't think we can launch the thing, because I don't know how to open the door.
[116:05.07]You either play Doki Doki Literature Club, or you play Baldi.
[116:07.50]There are no alternatives.
[116:09.50]No.
[116:18.89]Alright, let's just pretend this is the room that I cleaned, and this is the one that matters right now.
[116:31.03]Wow, look at how clean it is, right?
[116:32.22]I know.
[116:33.72]Hold on.
[116:33.96]I don't have the broom anymore?
[116:40.56]I have to take care of this.
[116:41.92]This is a lot of bullshit.
[116:43.34]I need to go back down to...
[116:53.59]Alright.
[116:55.43]I need a, uh... Where were they?
[116:56.93]What still needs to be cleaned up here?
[116:58.25]There's a whole spot over here.
[117:05.77]What is going on?
[117:09.10]Yeah.
[117:09.90]This spot here.
[117:18.74]God dammit, I need buckets.
[117:29.96]Okay.
[117:31.12]Fuck it.
[117:35.30]And bring three.
[117:37.34]I need to ascend.
[117:39.34]To where?
[117:39.76]I don't need to ascend.
[117:46.85]Jump in and out of the pool real quick.
[117:48.93]I already did that.
[117:50.47]You missed it.
[117:52.62]Jerma, I'm bored.
[117:53.50]Dual voice.
[118:16.86]Just give me a minute.
[118:21.54]I'm done.
[118:22.28]Stream's over.
[118:23.31]I'll see you tomorrow.
[118:27.35]See you tomorrow.
[118:34.71]Uh, so tomorrow, tomorrow, uh, what is planned is, uh, Joel and I are gonna be potentially, we're gonna be starting Halo Reach.
[118:50.53]We're gonna do Halo Reach today, but we, uh, we rescheduled for tomorrow.
[118:58.50]And then I played Hand Simulator, and everybody lo- If you weren't here earlier, rewind to that part of the VOD.
[119:05.60]Everybody thought it was so fucking funny.
[119:07.66]So good.
[119:09.50]There's not water in these!
[119:10.50]I thought this was a razor.
[119:25.41]Joel's gonna ignore you and just play Baldi's Basics.
[119:31.62]Don't even kid.
[119:41.09]But yeah, so I decided, instead of just postponing streaming till tomorrow, we decided to play a triple game today.
[119:51.14]Stream is just an extra one.
[119:54.08]I'm gonna go three days in a row from here on out after this.
[119:58.42]I'm assuming Halo Reach will be maybe a full stream or two.
[120:01.61]I don't know what the plans are.
[120:03.05]We'll see.
[120:05.63]And then we're gonna play Tools Up.
[120:07.69]We're gonna see if we can get that to work for the second, third, fourth day.
[120:13.48]Play Hand Simulator tomorrow.
[120:14.72]I already got what I wanted out of it.
[120:17.62]No more Hand Simulator!
[120:21.69]I already said it was the worst game of the decade and that I like kind of regret saying that Because that's definitely not true I know it's not true, but I said it and I need to like retract that statement because that's definitely not true Of the decade
[120:52.99]Alright, yeah, I'll call- No, not yet.
[120:55.63]I wanna clean this house.
[121:10.30]Just- I wanna do this part.
[121:12.54]I'm almost done.
[121:18.15]Well, okay, it's a base, not a house.
[121:25.24]Why does this shit not work?
[121:31.28]Five more minutes, mom.
[121:32.06]Five more minutes.
[121:32.56]Five more minutes.
[121:35.46]Uh, let's just bring him up there.
[121:41.24]Baldi, Baldi, Baldi.
[121:45.34]One day I will just turn on Baldi's basics, and I'm not gonna tell you when.
[121:49.95]It'll just happen one day.
[121:54.29]You'll just see it one day.
[122:03.78]That's a lie.
[122:04.68]That's a lie.
[122:05.48]That's a lie.
[122:08.46]Can't be a lie if it hasn't happened yet.
[122:14.12]Alright, so if I told you that I was going to play Baldi's Basics, and then six years went by and I played it, is that a lie?
[122:20.55]No?
[122:29.53]I played it.
[122:29.95]I didn't say I was gonna play it tomorrow.
[122:34.35]Can I clean this in here?
[122:35.45]You actually can.
[122:36.45]Wow.
[122:48.10]Technically.
[122:49.88]Yeah.
[122:51.50]Halo Reach should be fun.
[122:52.80]By the way, for those of you that don't know, I have never played one solitary minute of Halo.
[123:01.47]I told you Halo 2 is the only one I've ever played.
[123:04.63]And I played the multiplayer across like four TVs once or twice in college.
[123:11.51]I've never played one second of any of the campaigns.
[123:16.72]So we'll find out.
[123:20.72]That's not a lie.
[123:22.16]That is not a lie.
[123:22.92]I've never played Halo.
[123:25.32]I mean, so I've lied.
[123:29.22]No, I never had an Xbox.
[123:32.06]I didn't have a regular Xbox.
[123:35.02]And I got an Xbox 360 late into the game and just didn't play them.
[123:40.55]I played Halo 2.
[123:41.31]The multiplayer.
[123:44.91]Maybe for 45 seconds in two or three lives when I drove a car into a wall.
[123:51.84]And, like, threw a grenade at someone.
[124:02.21]Okay, what constitutes playing the game?
[124:03.99]Okay, is... Oh, I played Halo 2.
[124:09.46]But I really didn't, though.
[124:10.62]I can't even aim with one gun.
[124:12.82]I guess I physically pressed the button on it once.
[124:19.34]And then I watched somebody play for 15 minutes.
[124:24.69]So you played it.
[124:29.96]Physically, I have sat in front of the screen and played Halo 2 multiplayer for a minute or two minutes tops.
[124:42.59]So you played it.
[124:48.19]Okay, yes, I guess I've played it.
[125:01.10]Literally competitive Halo.
[125:02.52]A little reddit Jerma here.
[125:08.12]Yeah, alright.
[125:12.57]I love how somebody's doing that joke for me right now, and I didn't even plan it.
[125:37.72]Uh, alright.
[125:39.22]Alright!
[125:41.10]I'll see you guys later.
[125:43.04]Now I'm gonna call it here.
[125:43.87]This was a real wild one.
[125:47.69]And Medivh was actually pretty fun.
[125:50.15]So, you may actually see me complete that game.
[125:53.83]You actually might, because it was pretty fun.
[125:56.68]I did enjoy it.
[125:58.84]Thanks for watching the secret... Not even secret, I tweeted about it and I told everybody I was streaming today.
[126:04.08]Thanks for coming to the extra stream this week.
[126:07.70]See you tomorrow for Halo Reach cooperative multiplayer campaign.
[126:15.74]With Joel.
[126:19.12]Thanks for watching, guys.
[126:21.76]You made a video on Halo.
[126:23.39]I'm not going to click another Rickroll.
[126:29.21]Jump in.
[126:55.67]My computer crashed.
[126:57.99]I just have a bloody screen.
[127:09.11]Yeah, there's just blood on the screen.
[127:18.20]Alright.
[127:19.36]Actually, goodnight, guys.
[127:20.42]I'll see you tomorrow.
[127:23.73]I'm looking forward to Halo.
[127:24.99]I've heard a lot of things about Halo.
[127:26.49]I've heard, dude, Halo is... is just... it's like the best.
[127:31.33]You have to play it.
[127:32.21]You're gonna love it.
[127:33.87]Hope so.
[127:43.33]And when they all release, I'm gonna be playing all of them.
[127:46.01]I mean, I can't necessarily guarantee I'm gonna co-op every single one of them, but... we'll see.
[127:53.02]Hey, Bobboy!
[127:54.34]What's going on, Bobboy?
[127:55.20]Thanks for the five subs.
[128:03.58]Uh, Richard Nixon still, uh, top subgifter.
[128:05.91]Thank you.
[128:09.61]But, let's go back and listen to the bits.
[128:11.73]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[128:13.01]Thanks for hanging out.
[128:16.55]Earlier, earlier.

[128:32.52]Appreciate it.
[128:32.92]Thank you.
[128:34.67]I'll be okay, though.
[128:36.73]I'll be good to go.
[128:41.97]We'll continue to work on it and see what happens.
[128:47.78]Appreciate it, though.

[129:18.98]This is two years ago.
[129:20.50]This is me describing what I wanted the doctor to do.
[129:22.48]I wanted him to do exploratory surgery on me.
[129:26.56]Yeah, that was two years ago.
[129:33.49]Jesus.
[129:37.11]Time flies when you have a hernia.
[129:42.08]Thank you, Zake, for the $2.50.
[129:43.46]Your streams have been a soundtrack to many long, lonely nights of studying.
[129:47.62]Cheers for that.
[129:48.68]Still waiting for the cooking stream.
[129:52.65]Hopefully it's worth the wait when you see it eventually.
[129:56.53]We'll see.
[129:58.23]Hey Jason, thanks for the 500 bits.
[129:59.33]Hey Jerma, today marks the one year since I first started watching you.
[130:03.64]Today's also the same day since the green screen movie night.
[130:06.76]Ever since then, I was hooked on your content and never missed a stream.
[130:09.30]Not only have you helped me through so many tough times, but most importantly, you've helped us.
[130:14.14]Whether it's being called short or saying, look at me, you never cease to make us laugh.
[130:19.38]I'm so grateful to have discovered such a great guy.
[130:21.46]Keep on keeping on.
[130:24.82]Thank you.
[130:28.35]Really appreciate it, Jason.
[130:33.16]I'm glad you stuck around.
[130:36.62]Hope you continue to do so.
[130:42.52]Thanks again.
[130:43.88]Not sure if you saw that.
[130:44.89]It was quite wholesome.
[130:45.43]Yeah, we'll see.
[130:45.93]The one thing I'm concerned about is ping tomorrow.
[131:00.81]We're gonna have to see how the connection is.
[131:03.95]From, uh... You know, across the world.
[131:08.35]Might be interesting.
[131:12.48]But yeah, that's... Joel's a funny guy.
[131:18.72]We'll see how the stream is tomorrow.
[131:23.37]If it's not, it won't be too bad.
[131:25.94]Let's hope so.
[131:26.90]Because remember, I'm Pacific.
[131:28.58]So, west coast to... I wonder how far the travel time is.
[131:36.58]But, thank you, Marvash Magali.
[131:38.24]Appreciate it.
[131:38.60]Thank you, Gnarly, for the $2.50.
[131:41.80]My friend got me to play Hand Simulator.
[131:43.40]I've never raged more at a game in my entire life.
[131:46.12]I've beaten every Soulsborne, and I actively play League of Legends, and yet fucking Hand meme game is what breaks me.
[131:52.55]Fuck this game.
[131:53.47]Fun stream.
[131:58.27]You know the thing about that game?
[132:00.26]I would have sat there until I got it.
[132:05.28]Until I got it, I would have done it.
[132:09.70]But I had to stop.
[132:11.40]I had to just pull the plug.
[132:15.40]Even if I wasn't streaming, I would have sat there for like six hours.
[132:18.18]Trying to put the clip into the handgun.
[132:20.06]I know I would have.
[132:28.04]You didn't, though.
[132:29.40]I put the clip into the gun, and I fired the gun.
[132:33.94]I didn't shoot at anything.
[132:36.00]I didn't hit any targets.
[132:37.95]But it's okay.
[132:44.29]Thank you, Final Fantasy, for the 300 bits.
[132:46.63]They say, nice.
[132:47.79]Thank you.
[132:52.30]Uh, Martin had a meme.
[132:53.22]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[132:54.88]Ten bucks, appreciate that.
[132:56.45]Now you're gonna have to make up excuses like, I swear this doesn't usually happen.
[132:59.17]I guess I'm just nervous.
[133:15.01]Thank you, Snarbosis, for the 10 community subs earlier.
[133:18.31]Don't think we saw it.
[133:19.17]I think I was in the middle of doing a chill stream where I get very angry at a game that I then call the worst game of the decade.
[133:27.32]Chilling out, just hanging out.
[133:28.32]Chill stream today.
[133:30.10]Extra chill stream.
[133:33.14]Thank you, though, for the 10 community subs.
[133:34.52]Appreciate it.
[133:38.51]And thank you, MartinHadAMeme, again, for the thousand bits.
[133:42.80]C.A.D.
[133:43.86]B.T.V.
[133:44.78]What's going on, C.A.D.?
[133:45.64]A thousand bits here from C.A.D.
[133:50.64]What a game.
[133:51.20]It gives you a gun, makes you want to shoot yourself, and then doesn't let you.
[134:04.42]Alright, no.
[134:05.94]Hey, Jerma985 AMA.
[134:10.15]Hey, how's it going?
[134:10.73]I could get a large number 10 with fries, please.
[134:12.79]No.
[134:13.69]Did you ever play Halo?
[134:15.31]When's the next Kenshi stream?
[134:19.65]Kenshi was an incredible experience, and I'd love to stream it again.
[134:22.01]However, when you do multiple streams in a row like that, it can get pretty tiring.
[134:25.95]A lot of people in chat were tired of it, too.
[134:27.85]But seeing how warm of a response the videos on the second channel got, I'll probably play it again at some point.
[134:32.38]It's supposed to be fun to return to it at some point.
[134:35.04]Just like I return every Tuesday to get a $5 waffle meal at Burger King.
[134:42.34]What was that sketch you had 100% confidence in that didn't execute as expected?
[134:47.74]The infamous slap myself in the face joke was supposed to end with me turning around and leaving the room, with my arm whipping around, with my body turning to follow, but I timed it wrong while looking at my second monitor.
[134:58.72]I suppose that went better than expected, much like the $12.99 family bundle deal they have at Burger King.
[135:04.69]That's three cheeseburgers, three small fries, and three wafers for under $13.00.
[135:12.13]Thoughts on the new crispy pretzel chicken fries?
[135:14.11]Is Burger King crispy crunchy pretzel outside, tender juicy white meat chicken inside?
[135:18.96]New crispy pretzel chicken fries.
[135:23.48]That stream was a mess.
[135:24.76]I don't condone the things I said while I was live.
[135:28.58]It was really out of character.
[135:29.66]I don't think you'll be seeing me streaming with him again.
[135:32.78]Sorry, what?
[135:38.60]Have you ever tried coffee marinated chicken stuffed with Cheetos before?
[135:42.96]Look at you.
[135:43.48]It's the same fucking coffee Cheetos chicken joke again.
[135:46.21]Well played look everyone.
[135:47.65]We have a fucking comedy genius over here Jesus Christ you subhuman.
[135:52.37]Okay, can't think of anything.
[135:54.19]This is not me.
[135:55.61]This is not me This is me this is somebody this is me pretending that this is somebody pretending to be me Why are you a massive compulsive liar?
[136:09.70]If you're looking to throw hands, I'd be willing to meet you at next year's... When to buy the other a $3 10-piece nugget.
[136:17.28]Okay, I can't... Okay.
[136:18.68]Oh my fucking god.
[136:20.56]Damn it!
[136:38.51]Alright, that's it.
[136:39.29]That's it.
[136:41.69]That's it.
[136:42.29]Alright.
[136:43.12]Abort!
[136:43.66]Abort!
[136:44.12]Abort!
[136:44.54]Abort!
[136:44.96]Abort!
[136:45.54]Abort!
[136:46.62]There's no AMAs going on.
[136:50.48]There's no AMAs going on.
[136:53.59]There's no AMAs.
[137:13.42]It's not my AMA.
[137:20.54]Why?
[137:29.71]This is a PR nightmare for me.
[137:32.85]Yes.
[137:40.20]This is gonna pop up like ten times, and I have no control over this.
[137:44.48]No, no, what, what?
[137:45.66]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[137:49.30]A real AMA, you have to prove it's a real AMA.
[137:53.26]Don't, I have to tweet out a picture of me holding up a sign that's pointing to it, going like, Reddit AMA!
[137:58.08]Uh, January 10th, 2020, right?
[138:02.53]That's how you know it's real, so it doesn't matter.
[138:18.67]God fucking damn it.
[138:19.81]Okay, let's keep going.
[138:22.00]Let's keep going.
[138:24.64]PR nightmare.
[138:41.11]Anyways, thank you.
[138:43.07]Really appreciate it.
[138:44.11]Large27, thanks for the 500 bits.
[138:47.66]Dermal, please, for the love of all that is holy, stop for your health and mine.
[138:50.78]I can't take it anymore.
[138:51.58]I'm about to die and combust into a million pieces of dirt.
[138:54.84]Please stop.
[138:55.58]Oh my god, stop.
[138:56.60]I was playing Hand Simulator and, like, nobody liked it.
[139:01.09]Thanks.
[139:05.37]Hey, uh, HipMoose, we didn't see this.
[139:07.59]Five community subs from HipMoose.
[139:13.99]Oh, man.
[139:15.73]Thank you, Hypmoos.
[139:18.51]Yeah, what's probably going to end up happening here...
[139:40.01]Is I'm going to do... I'm going to do some... Maybe try to do some supplements and stuff.
[139:45.31]But I'm probably going to start to go see a physical therapist.
[139:50.14]Because I know that there are some things to help kind of unlock your joints a little bit.
[139:56.38]Different stretches, different physical therapy you can do to help with this issue.
[140:06.14]Because like I said before, it really does feel like I almost just need somebody to like press down and twist and then pull up and then twist and it'll be like and I'll go back to normal.
[140:20.95]But I know that, I mean, that's just kind of how it feels.
[140:27.73]But even sometimes, if I lean back, and I pull back a little, I can feel inside of my chest, around to my back, like... It's like... So, I don't know.
[140:50.42]That's what I get for shoplifting?
[140:53.05]That's what you get for stopping lifting.
[140:54.93]Oh.
[141:03.36]This is not lifting anymore.
[141:05.10]Well, it's actually probably a good thing I don't, like, lift any weights anymore.
[141:11.49]So I'll probably do some physical therapy.
[141:13.05]See if we can move some shit around.
[141:16.89]See if I can do some stretches.
[141:19.41]Try to loosen up these apparently inflamed joints.
[141:23.21]And yeah, I know that I've been told, the doctor told me you might get like a shot of cortisone, cortisol, whatever, steroid into the bone, into your... That's not good for you though.
[141:34.71]I've heard that that's really not good for you.
[141:44.32]We'll see what they say.
[141:46.64]I'd like to try physical therapy first.
[141:56.25]I've had that in my back and it's the second worst pain I've ever felt.
[142:00.85]Damn it.
[142:01.83]I will.
[142:04.95]Is the pain in your back or is it on your stomach?
[142:07.61]It's my whole entire core.
[142:09.99]So it starts right in the middle of my sternum, right in my breastbone, and then goes out inside that area around my ribs, and then it's all around the back of my ribs too, my whole back.
[142:22.25]Mostly, most pain is on the right side of my back into the center of my chest.
[142:30.25]This has been about a year and a half of dealing with it.
[142:34.07]And something that I didn't really talk that much about, because it was just like, what is there even to talk about?
[142:40.99]So, it's just like a constant, just there, always.
[142:50.35]But this last six months or so, I've been really pushing hard, hard, hard, hammering hard to really try to figure out what the fuck is even going on with my body.
[143:04.88]And I've, over the last, yeah, like six, seven, eight months straight, I've been trying to figure out what the fuck it is.
[143:13.55]And maybe one piece of that puzzle is the hernia, which is what I have, that's what I have.
[143:18.69]But the doctor also says it's probably both.
[143:22.83]Fuck.
[143:25.20]Oh well.
[143:29.28]His skeleton is hatching.
[143:40.09]But, hey, we get it.
[143:42.41]When's the Baldi stream?
[143:43.75]Oh my god.
[143:47.83]There's still blood all over my screen, by the way.
[143:52.53]We get it.
[144:01.44]Oh my god.
[144:02.14]You guys are ruthless.
[144:08.62]I...
[144:13.00]Yeah, I've got this, like, fucking medical problem that's, like, really been bothering me for, like, two years.
[144:17.39]Where's Baldi?
[144:22.65]Something about it's, like, funny, though.
[144:24.37]It kind of is to me.
[144:28.25]It's all good.
[144:31.92]Hey, thanks a lot, Frodeon.
[144:33.04]Weapon for the 256.
[144:33.44]Sorry to hear about the hernia and ribs.
[144:36.90]I'm sure you don't need to hear it from me, but take it easy if you need to.
[144:39.08]I'm sure you'll overcome it.
[144:42.19]Yeah, from all the things I've heard about, if it is costochondritis, is that for some people it's around for like a few years and then it just disappears.
[144:59.22]Oh yeah, it's inflammation in your ribs, joint pain and joint problems inside your ribs.
[145:04.16]Oh, by the way, it's gone now.
[145:05.64]It's been four years and now it's just not there anymore.
[145:08.28]What?
[145:10.56]What the hell?
[145:10.96]What are you talking about?
[145:11.78]What?
[145:19.29]Your body just moths it out.
[145:29.01]Check and make sure it's not a heart thing.
[145:30.77]No, we've eliminated every major organ in my body.
[145:38.91]At this point, I've had enough blood tests and scopes, and it's not anything going... I don't... It would be shocking to me if this was an organ problem.
[145:58.11]You need those.
[145:59.69]I know.
[146:02.91]Did you have an x-ray?
[146:03.67]Yes.
[146:04.17]I've had an MRI.
[146:06.27]And an x-ray.
[146:07.66]Of two different places.
[146:13.88]And they confirmed a few things.
[146:15.48]And there we go.
[146:19.18]You want to look at your x-rays on stream.
[146:24.95]Now that would probably be the strangest thing that you would ever see on Twitch.
[146:27.61]Because no one's ever done that.
[146:31.09]Like, you want x-ray of my spine?
[146:34.31]What, you want me to pretend to know what I'm looking at?
[146:47.73]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[146:49.86]That's super naked.
[146:53.30]That is naked 3.0.
[146:54.48]Put it up on your Reddit.
[147:03.70]Yeah, just make like a post.
[147:05.36]Hey guys, here's the result.
[147:06.35]Here's all my MRIs.
[147:07.83]What's wrong with me?
[147:16.01]Oh, no, dude, that is strange.
[147:18.34]That's strange.
[147:20.32]That's really strange.
[147:21.86]I can't do that.
[147:22.94]I can't do that.
[147:23.48]That's too fucked up for me.
[147:24.50]It's like, oh, hey, it's like your x-rays of your back and spine and shit.
[147:28.47]It's like, I don't know.
[147:29.89]No, no, no.
[147:31.95]I don't want you guys to see me naked.
[147:33.79]I don't want you guys to see me times three naked.
[147:38.70]Then my dream would just come true.
[147:43.26]But, yeah, I've got turmeric tea.
[147:45.50]I'm gonna be doing that.
[147:49.12]Drinking turmeric tea.
[147:51.20]Probably taking some turmeric.
[147:53.86]Try to eat more of an anti-inflammatory diet.
[147:56.65]That's hard to fucking do, though.
[147:58.29]Like, no dairy, no processed meats, no nothing fried, no gluten, no wheat.
[148:05.49]That's so... No hydrogenated oils.
[148:08.67]If you live in 2019, it's actually really hard to avoid all those things.
[148:19.75]Because half of the shit that you ever eat is just cooked in some kind of pressed oil.
[148:23.78]Unless it's olive oil, which is... That's not inflammatory.
[148:29.30]Or whatever.
[148:35.06]Just go vegan?
[148:35.72]I could never do it.
[148:36.96]I could never go vegetarian or vegan.
[148:39.69]I just... I could not do it.
[148:40.79]I couldn't do it.
[148:43.35]I'd go crazy after like a month.
[148:45.71]I'd lose my mind.
[148:46.47]I'd turn into like Gollum.
[148:50.34]I love certain foods and certain meats so much.
[148:53.77]I could not, I just would not be able to do it.
[149:03.71]What the fuck is this?
[149:06.21]Hey, Reddit, here's your memory.
[149:07.18]Here are my MRI scans.
[149:08.22]What the fuck?
[149:21.80]If you're a brand new viewer and you're brand new to that subreddit, and you think that's me or something, you're going to be just like, this person is like freaking me out.
[149:38.96]But, anyways.
[149:41.36]Uh, thank you, SadVegan, for the 300 bits.
[149:42.82]Thank you, FreudingWeapon, for the 256.
[149:45.32]And thank you, Gnarly, for the 250.
[149:46.38]I had a hernia removed from my stomach when I was like 6 or 7.
[149:49.16]I don't remember anything, but the dream I had when I went under, I was on a steel bed in an empty room and a metal claw dug into my stomach and pulled my hernia out.
[149:57.85]It was a scary and painful dream, but I got a dual popsicle afterwards, so easy 10 out of 10.
[150:03.91]Oh my god.
[150:11.26]Thank you, please go out with my grandpa for the 500 bits.
[150:13.92]Hey, Jerma, just want to thank you for saving my relationship.
[150:17.20]Me and my girlfriend have had some hard times together, and I didn't think our relationship would last till we discovered... Erotic... It's hard to not... It's hard to say this.
[150:36.63]Erotic... No.
[150:37.99]Nope.
[150:44.99]No.
[150:49.17]Rat movie RP, and since then our relationship is going strong.
[150:53.43]Thank you.
[150:54.47]She's a giant rat.
[151:02.05]Okay.
[151:05.95]Okay.
[151:11.96]Shitty viewbot, thanks for the 400 bits.
[151:15.56]seems good hey Jerma since this is the week of co-op and you might need some game recommendations minus like just payday one and two uh you decide whether you want to play or not and I hope your hernia gets better me too um well I know for the next day or two it's gonna be halo reach after the stream tomorrow I think we'll probably just come to a consensus if we're just gonna do it the next stream
[151:41.85]Maybe, uh, Joel and I will be like, oh, that was fun, that was cool, but... Maybe we don't want to finish it together.
[151:48.67]Maybe I would just, if he wasn't into it, doing it again, I would just do the rest.
[151:52.77]Something like that.
[151:53.71]We'll find out.
[151:56.12]And then there's another co-op game that's already lined up.
[151:57.86]If that doesn't work, though, then we'll probably look for something else.
[152:05.50]Thank you.
[152:09.26]For the 400 bits.
[152:13.21]You say this every time!
[152:14.41]This is like two or three of you that have the same end to your messages.

[154:10.14]I didn't mean I was going to say happy birthday to you on your 25th birthday.
[154:14.80]I was talking about happy birthday on your 28th birthday.

[154:22.23]Siri, make a note here.
[154:24.61]Remind me on December 6th to say happy birthday to the coldest fridge.

[154:39.65]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[154:40.49]Appreciate it.
[154:41.07]Why is everything 6%?
[154:43.70]Why do I have to take 6% of your money?
[154:44.78]Is that the number that we agreed upon somehow?
[154:47.22]6% tax?
[155:09.03]I said that?
[155:09.55]Oh.
[155:09.89]Not a bad number.
[155:16.61]Hey, uh.
[155:18.73]Fyro Sweet.
[155:20.66]Thanks for the 400 bits.
[155:21.70]Dude, Jerma.
[155:23.04]Thank you for streaming on my birthday.
[155:25.28]Happy birthday.
[155:26.52]We got one right now.
[155:31.01]It's Fyro's birthday.
[155:32.87]Happy birthday, Fyro.
[155:34.87]Hope you had a good one.
[155:40.36]Happy birthday.
[155:43.86]Midna says, thanks for the 500 bits.
[155:46.88]Hey Jerma, I don't usually watch full streams due to my work schedule and only heard about your medical procedure through Sus last week.
[155:53.77]Hope everything went well and you're feeling better.
[155:55.27]Thanks for streaming.
[155:58.33]Yeah.
[155:59.87]I'm doing alright.
[156:01.95]I'm at the stage right now where I'm... The light at the end of the tunnel is starting to open and I'm going, I can see through that.
[156:10.87]I can see it.
[156:11.50]The beams kind of just hit me right in the eye and it's like, oh, oh, oh, oh, it's so bright.
[156:16.54]And I'm going, I'm walking towards it.
[156:18.34]No, that's not a good, that's a bad analogy.
[156:20.62]That means, that means I'm dead.
[156:23.69]That's a terrible, no, no, the light at the end, don't go into the light, Jeremy.
[156:28.05]Don't go into the light.
[156:29.97]Go the other way.
[156:31.27]Open the door that you came through.
[156:34.60]Go away from the light, right.
[156:37.61]Uh, I'm getting to the end of the road here.
[156:40.20]That also is not a great analogy.
[156:43.48]Okay.
[156:44.40]I know what might be wrong with me.
[156:46.98]There, done.
[156:50.30]So, therefore... Hopefully the next couple of months, solutions start to be put in place as to this fucking dumb mystery illness.
[157:00.93]So I kind of have some answers now.
[157:03.03]There you go.
[157:03.47]That's better than don't walk towards the light.
[157:10.07]But, yeah, I'm fine.
[157:11.17]Don't worry.
[157:11.81]I'm fine.
[157:16.25]It's not a significant enough problem to really affect my day-to-day life.
[157:22.20]It's just kind of there.
[157:24.66]And I always know it's there, and it's just irritating.
[157:27.90]But it's not... It doesn't necessarily affect too much of my actual day-to-day-to-day life.
[157:36.44]It just kind of hurts sometimes.
[157:40.58]It just hurts a little.
[157:43.26]Not enough to really, you know, it just hurts a little.
[157:45.25]That's it.
[157:45.53]Am I colorblind?
[157:50.73]I don't think so.
[157:54.59]But I appreciate it, Midna.
[157:55.74]Thank you.
[157:58.01]Alright, but here's the thing.
[157:59.09]You have to hand that to the cashier.
[158:28.77]The cashier doesn't know who I am.
[158:31.55]So I am almost taken completely out of that equation.
[158:35.61]That's a thing between you and that cashier.
[158:38.85]They don't know me.
[158:44.15]And if they do, that's the surprise of the century.
[159:08.25]Somebody just linked it.
[159:09.21]Okay.
[159:21.50]What the fuck, man?
[159:28.38]That's so fucking ridiculous.
[159:31.87]Dunkin' Donuts.
[159:32.57]How does it look?
[159:33.78]Here's some Dunkin' Donuts because you have good news.
[159:35.78]You can upload custom photos on Dunkin' Donuts gift cards.
[159:39.24]It's here.
[159:53.93]You guys are fucking... You guys are fucking hilarious.
[159:58.49]But...
[160:00.77]What's that person that you give it to?
[160:08.30]Because you're epic.
[160:09.78]That's how I read that.
[160:12.28]Here's some junkie donuts.
[160:14.40]Because you're epic.
[160:16.10]That's how I see it.
[160:26.18]No, no, no.
[160:26.82]Put it in a greeting card now.
[160:27.76]You know those cards that you open and they just talk?
[160:30.97]Put that... Get that soundbite into a greeting card.
[160:34.51]Put the Dunkin' Donuts card in there.
[160:35.95]And when it's opened, it plays that really shitty, low bitrate quality audio.
[160:42.72]I mean, you have my permission.
[160:48.88]Anyways.
[160:51.43]We are almost at the end.
[160:53.87]Let's get the credits rolling.
[160:55.61]As they do.
[160:56.55]Let's move the scene over to here.
[161:02.26]That's for all the credits.
[161:04.08]Thanks for watching.
[161:04.68]Thanks for the subs.
[161:06.58]Holy shit, that's a lot of subs.
[161:10.75]I was gone for about four days, so... Look at all these racked up subs.
[161:16.21]You guys are fucking awesome.
[161:17.01]Thank you.
[161:17.83]Thanks for the support.
[161:18.53]Thanks for streaming.
[161:20.76]Thank you for streaming, guys.
[161:23.40]I really loved that hand simulator stream.
[161:25.96]It was great.
[161:28.54]No, thank you for real.
[161:30.58]All of you.
[161:33.72]Let's head back to the bits.
[161:34.56]Let's finish him up.
[161:40.38]Uh, Flugboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[161:42.08]You know how long I've been in this community.
[161:44.83]I've seen everything.
[161:45.65]I'm sure you've seen it by now, but somebody put the fucking picture of you crying on their credit card.
[161:49.91]I love this community with all my heart, and they never cease to amaze me.
[161:52.45]What?
[161:53.57]Somebody put it on the... What?
[161:54.75]Somebody put that image on a... What do you mean, that image?
[161:59.50]Do you have a link?
[162:00.00]Link?
[162:06.52]Hey, Mad, thanks for the 1500 bits, Mad.
[162:09.20]No, I'm not, I'm kidding.
[162:11.26]Thank you, Mad, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[162:13.46]So, it was my birthday on Thanksgiving, which had a good meal.
[162:17.16]So, here's your obligatory 10%.
[162:18.46]It was 6%.
[162:20.36]Must have gotten that incorrect.
[162:21.94]Please let me out of your basement, Mr. Comedy Man.
[162:23.72]It's getting dark in here.
[162:24.62]Uh, MonkaS.
[162:25.74]Okay.
[162:27.76]Oh, he spelled it.
[162:29.38]M-O-N-K-U-H.
[162:32.18]MonkaS, with two S's.
[162:42.35]Uh, Phylactery, I missed 5,000 bits from Phylactery.
[162:47.06]Thanks for the $50, Phylactery.
[162:48.86]Again.
[162:49.98]Again, again, again, again.
[162:51.22]50, 50, 50, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100.
[162:57.96]Thank you.
[162:58.74]And you save $50 for playing Spill Joke, the game.
[163:01.37]Love you, Jeremy.
[163:02.89]That level was huge.
[163:03.69]I didn't think it was going to be that big.
[163:08.77]It was 500 last time.
[163:09.31]Yeah.
[163:12.24]yeah it was and who could forget Bob boy Bob boy 61 I mean out of out of the the potentially just thousands and thousands and thousands of community members Bob boy 61 has got to be up there at least in like the top in the top like fucking two to three hundred thousand people
[163:43.58]Thank you, Bobboy, for the five subs.
[163:44.92]Appreciate it.
[163:48.10]You rank us.
[163:57.46]He's picking favorites now.
[164:00.99]Yeah, he's in the top two.
[164:02.49]How many people actually watch this channel?
[164:04.33]I have no idea.
[164:06.57]How many people follow this channel?
[164:07.61]Two what?
[164:10.25]250 something?
[164:10.91]270?
[164:11.27]How many followers are on this channel?
[164:17.66]I'm too lazy to click over here, apparently.
[164:20.02]How many followers do I have?
[164:23.84]265,000 followers, okay?
[164:25.26]So, yeah.
[164:27.24]Bobboy's definitely in somewhere in the top, like, 300,000.
[164:29.48]That's a flex.
[164:29.88]How is that a... What do you mean, how is that a flex?
[164:46.26]Do a tier list of all your viewers.
[164:48.46]Everyone that's followed.
[164:57.77]That would take probably five years to do that.
[165:00.75]If I did it every single stream.
[165:03.05]And it would never be finished because people would know that stream was happening and they would continue to make new accounts and follow.
[165:11.34]In the first week of doing that stream, I would probably get 10,000 new followers.
[165:16.98]It would never end.
[165:20.16]You guys are all up at... Hold on, I don't want... Wait a minute.
[165:24.06]I don't want you to think.
[165:26.50]You know, I don't want you... Oh, you... Everyone's S-tiered.
[165:32.01]I don't know if I can say that.
[165:32.69]What about the person that came in here and they maybe followed the channel and they called me like a fucking idiot like two days ago?
[165:39.67]Is that person on S-tiered?
[165:48.33]This is not you making the tier list.
[165:49.66]This is me making the tier list.
[165:58.96]Everyone except him.
[166:02.54]Yeah, everybody except that person.
[166:05.55]Who is it, though?
[166:06.27]I don't know.
[166:07.69]M-O-N-K-U-H space B-S-S.
[166:10.53]I don't know.
[166:13.45]Who is it?
[166:15.47]Thank you, Backen, for the 300 bits.
[166:17.59]Hi, Jerma.
[166:18.05]Thanks for streaming, as always.
[166:18.91]I'm losing... I'm losing cognition more and more, but hopefully my upcoming appointment should help, maybe.
[166:25.98]Anyways, I hope you and Chad have a wonderful day.
[166:31.98]Thanks for the 300 bits, Backen.
[166:38.46]Let's send some love and energy over to Backen.
[166:45.58]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[166:53.91]Hope you have a wonderful day.
[166:59.25]Take care.
[166:59.65]Thank you so much for the 300 bits.
[167:06.32]Send some jermaHearts over to back and place it.
[167:17.42]There we go.
[167:17.82]That's what I like to see.
[167:20.18]That's what I like to see.
[167:29.64]Also, thank you to Snooze and Copter for the $2.50.
[167:31.18]Hey, Jeremy, I missed the beginning of the stream, so I haven't heard the medical updates yet.
[167:37.32]Hope you're alright.
[167:38.00]However, I wanted to say something else.
[167:40.05]You ever been robbed?
[167:42.35]What?
[167:45.29]Oh, no.
[167:45.51]There's more.
[167:45.85]There's more.
[167:46.17]There's more.
[167:46.45]There's more.
[167:50.12]Any stories that you could share?
[167:51.32]No, I've never been robbed before.
[167:58.60]They said, my girlfriend recently got her phone snatched out of her hands.
[168:03.43]Holy shit, that's horrible.
[168:06.09]Currently seeing if they can access the cameras, but it was a real shock.
[168:09.73]Some people are unbelievable.
[168:11.05]Also, play Disco Elysium.
[168:12.45]Do it.
[168:12.79]I just started it and I swear to God this game is made for you.
[168:20.04]um no well I've never been I've never been robbed like somebody comes up to you and says hey give me your money or something that's never happened but disco elsium I I maybe
[168:48.52]That's been kind of just sitting there.
[168:50.06]I feel like Disco Elysium is going to be Dusk.
[168:52.38]I'm not going to play it for like a year.
[168:54.32]And then I'll play it and it'll be one of my favorite games I've played the whole year.
[168:56.90]That's kind of what happened with Dusk.
[168:58.64]So just count on it.
[169:01.63]Count on it.
[169:09.21]Hey Bobo Drago, thanks for the 500 bits.
[169:12.21]They say, sup Jerma, playing Apex Legends right now.
[169:14.99]I absolutely love the game.
[169:15.91]Have you ever played it?
[169:17.02]I have not.
[169:19.24]Also, nice stream, and also my username is pronounced Bobo Durango.
[169:22.96]Please say it.
[169:25.34]There's no N. It's Bobo Durago.
[169:36.54]What have I done?
[169:36.96]What do you mean, what have I done?
[169:37.78]What did I do?
[169:38.51]What did I do?
[169:47.57]Okay, everyone's like, oh my god, he said... Okay, do you understand?
[169:51.33]Saying names out loud that I... I have many panic attacks when it's like, wait, he said it.
[169:58.78]He said the thing.
[170:00.30]What did I say?
[170:00.72]What happened?
[170:01.26]Where?
[170:01.86]What did I do?
[170:06.82]It's like, every, like, seven names, or every, like, ten names, there's that one, like, panic attack moment where it's like, did somebody just phonetically make me say something horrible?
[170:16.32]No, no, not right, no, no, no, okay, no.
[170:25.27]But no, I've never played Apex.
[170:26.79]I'm not really into the BR thing.
[170:30.32]Was never my cup of tea.
[170:35.91]I heard that it was fun, if you liked BRs.
[170:40.05]But then I heard that it was not fun anymore.
[170:47.79]You won PUBG Mobile on stream.
[170:51.17]Yeah, but I only played PUBG Mobile for like two weeks, and then I just deleted it and never played it again.
[171:02.04]But... Hey, KXZ, thanks for the $20.
[171:04.92]2,000 bits from KXZ.
[171:06.40]No message.
[171:06.83]Thank you.
[171:10.45]Thanks for the 2,000 bits.
[171:13.85]Uh, Squimpist, thanks for the $2.50.
[171:15.55]Hey, Jermbo, just wanted to say I know chronic illnesses, pains, they're no joke.
[171:19.75]And I'm sorry about the bozos in chat who are mean about it.
[171:22.29]Living with these things can be tough, but you're tougher.
[171:24.80]Godspeed.
[171:30.18]Yeah, but...
[171:32.30]Here's the thing.
[171:32.90]It's not... I've had an annoying chronic illness for like more than 10 years.
[171:42.75]I kind of know what to expect.
[171:44.21]I've had irritable bowel disease just for... I don't know how long.
[171:54.68]I was a junior in college when I first started having the problems.
[172:01.81]that's that's what 10 12 12 plus years ago something like that so you know I it's it's it is what it is it is what it is I'm just gonna keep just uh picking at it you know what I mean
[172:30.14]Till I start to get some answers and some real solutions, right?
[172:34.68]Which those should be starting very soon.
[172:38.20]Hey, Saranwraps!
[172:40.66]Thank you for the 300 bits.
[172:42.24]Hey, Jerma, thanks for streaming despite your health problems.
[172:44.90]Is the game Rain World on your radar?
[172:47.70]Rain World?
[172:53.66]Uh, what is Rain World?
[172:59.81]Not Rim World, right?
[173:02.32]No, Rain World.
[173:04.88]What is this game?
[173:05.52]This looks pretty cool.
[173:12.44]Are you like a little fox or something?
[173:19.53]Wayne's World?
[173:20.49]No.
[173:20.73]I'll punch that into Steam after the stream, see what it looks like.
[173:25.93]It's very cute, very hard.
[173:30.80]But I mean, I... On stream.
[173:35.81]I completed... After only... On hard.
[173:42.83]So I think I'll be alright.
[173:47.78]Make a good what do I do stream game.
[173:49.36]That's cool.
[173:54.69]Hey, Gondolin, thanks for the 250.
[173:56.11]Hey, Choomer, Chad plus Boomer.
[173:58.65]Will you do a video game award stream with your villain hair?
[174:02.61]Nah, I'll probably have a haircut by then.
[174:05.01]I'll have a haircut by then.
[174:11.09]Thank you, Gondolin.
[174:11.77]Appreciate it.
[174:12.19]Thank you, Saturn, for the 500 bits.
[174:14.14]Hey, Jerma, it's inspiring that you have these health issues like IBS, hernias, and back problems, but you still get up and entertain us where others may not even get out of bed.
[174:22.70]Much love.
[174:27.70]Here's the thing, though.
[174:30.64]This is one of the... This is probably in the top one, two, or three things that I care about in the whole world.
[174:36.51]I have to.
[174:44.15]I care so much about doing this.
[174:46.35]I have so much fun.
[174:48.09]This is so interesting to me.
[174:49.87]That I... I would rather be doing this than anything else.
[174:57.14]You know what I mean?
[175:03.54]And it's not, don't get me wrong, it's not a scenario where I'm getting up and forcing myself to turn a stream on and I'm not healthy or happy or anything.
[175:15.88]No, that's not the case at all.
[175:21.58]If that was the case, I just wouldn't do it.
[175:24.35]I just wouldn't turn the stream on.
[175:28.62]Which I've done many times.
[175:29.76]Many, many, many times.
[175:30.68]I've pushed a stream.
[175:31.74]Delayed a stream.
[175:32.80]Said, you know what?
[175:33.40]No.
[175:33.64]We're going to do like three days.
[175:35.98]Like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[175:37.16]Instead of what I said.
[175:37.98]I'm not feeling it today.
[175:39.56]I do it all the time.
[175:45.52]So do not worry about that at all.
[175:54.07]I'm not in a position right now where it's a major, major, major issue or anything.
[175:59.63]It's just a minor problem.
[176:03.17]That's going to take... Here's the thing.
[176:06.09]It's a minor problem that's going to take some potential major changes for me to fix.
[176:13.26]Right?
[176:15.58]Then that's what you do.
[176:20.06]But I do appreciate it.
[176:20.80]Appreciate the concern.
[176:21.92]Do not worry.
[176:26.24]Thank you, Producers!
[176:28.30]Thank you, Producers-san.
[176:31.41]For the 500 bits.
[176:32.29]I want to thank you for making me laugh so much.
[176:36.37]This time when I have- There's times when I haven't laughed so hard.
[176:39.36]Oh, sorry about that.
[176:41.08]I got like a bubble in my throat.
[176:46.84]There's time where I haven't laughed so hard in my life, thanks to you.
[176:49.91]It's been really making my days that much better, considering where I am now.
[176:53.73]Kind of lost and drifting at the moment, trying to find my place, but these laughs are well worth making me know the world is still turning, and also that Burger King has the Whopper Jr., which has the same great taste as the regular Whopper, for $1.50.
[177:07.00]Except it's fucking tiny.
[177:09.31]It's a small sandwich.
[177:11.45]Okay.
[177:12.51]It's, uh, it's, uh, Whopper Jr.
[177:14.73]is, um, just, uh, Wendy's bacon, uh, Wendy's Jr.
[177:19.99]Bacon.
[177:20.74]What the fuck?
[177:21.10]What's the, what's the thing called with the huge bunch of lettuce on it and they've got rid of the lettuce?
[177:25.90]They changed it recently.
[177:26.74]It's just a tomato now.
[177:27.98]What's it called?
[177:28.32]The Jr.
[177:28.72]Bacon Cheeseburger.
[177:29.40]Okay.
[177:37.39]From Wendy's.
[177:40.15]I like.
[177:43.53]Did they change the recipe or something?
[177:44.77]Because I remember it had lettuce on it, and I didn't get lettuce last time.
[177:49.82]Wendy's is not kosher.
[177:53.10]Is McDonald's and Burger King kosher?
[178:06.29]I don't think it is.
[178:09.29]No, McDonald's is not kosher.
[178:10.73]What do you mean kosher?
[178:12.53]McDonald's and Burger King?
[178:23.39]There are rats.
[178:24.33]I can't even say that out loud because I don't want to get sued.
[178:27.63]There are rats in Rat Movie 2.
[178:29.55]It's a fun movie.
[178:35.53]But...
[178:37.44]Only two or three more to do.
[178:38.64]We've got ShadesFen for 250.
[178:43.48]Hey, Jerma, watching your VR stream videos lately and didn't remember just how funny they were.
[178:47.09]You're going to do more VR before Half-Life Alyx.
[178:50.28]Yes.
[178:51.72]Yes, yes, yes.
[178:54.00]Also, ever since the I'm Jammer Lammy and Parappa streams have been massively hooked on the OST, especially the Jammer Lammy one.
[179:00.92]Can never thank you enough for all the laughs and introducing me to such an awesome music.
[179:04.70]Can't wait to see what you have in store for us during December.
[179:06.88]Now put these kids to sleep, will ya?
[179:12.36]Yes, there will be another VR stream before Half-Life Alyx.
[179:18.08]And I'll probably just do...
[179:22.03]It'll be one of those scenarios where... Is this even playing?
[179:25.70]Why is the music stopped?
[179:28.78]Okay, that was weird.
[179:30.56]It'll be a scenario where... We'll do like another five, ten games over the course of a week.
[179:39.20]So yeah, I... Absolutely.
[179:41.70]And I will be... And I will be one of... The every single streamer on the website... That's doing Half-Life Alyx at launch.
[179:52.73]Yes.
[179:53.85]They will.
[179:59.20]But thank you.
[180:00.88]Also, this is, uh, from, uh, Flugboy.
[180:06.18]It's a Twitter link, and it's... It's the Dunkin' Donuts gift card.
[180:12.72]This has 17,000 likes, and has been retweeted 5 fucking thousand times.
[180:19.27]I thought this was just, like, a few dozen of you thought this was funny.
[180:26.31]What?
[180:35.75]What the fuck?
[180:39.33]Link the tweet.
[180:39.99]This 5,000, I can't even get like 5,000 retweets on anything.
[180:57.21]Oh my god.
[180:58.07]It's because you don't tweet.
[181:07.60]Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[181:09.26]But when I do.
[181:10.62]When I do.
[181:11.14]That's so funny.
[181:17.34]And then the other tweet is the debit card, the credit card.
[181:22.74]I think somebody linked the picture already, but... God.
[181:34.01]Am I gonna do Boneworks?
[181:36.07]Yeah, if I'm gonna do Boneworks, I need the new controllers, though.
[181:38.71]I have to get those index controllers.
[181:40.93]The game was made for it.
[181:47.67]When you do go viral, it's the mom baking cookies of the drawstring tweets.
[181:53.26]Going viral.
[181:54.04]I'm going... Hey, mom, I'm going viral!
[182:00.05]If you get the Index Controls before Christmas, you get Alex for free.
[182:02.77]Is this... Really?
[182:03.87]That's a pretty good deal.
[182:07.86]Alright, guys.
[182:08.40]We'll see you tomorrow.
[182:11.78]Joel and I are going to try to attempt to play Halo Reach co-op.
[182:16.97]What did I just do?
[182:17.57]That's the wrong thing.
[182:18.77]It's this one.
[182:23.05]So, we'll see you tomorrow.
[182:24.19]If something comes up for some reason, then we'll probably figure something else out.
[182:33.15]Flugboy, thanks for the 250 right at the end here.
[182:36.03]I know I didn't add a caption that last one, but I'm sure that you know what those links are by now.
[182:41.16]Hope you have a good rest of your night.
[182:43.00]Wish me luck on my finals.
[182:44.18]Please, I really need it.
[182:45.04]Good luck on your finals.
[182:45.82]Hopefully you studied.
[182:47.28]Hopefully you get that information walked in.
[182:52.42]Thanks for the 250.
[182:52.90]Good luck on your finals, Flugboy.
[182:54.44]Thank you.
[183:02.77]Oh, Jerma, real quick before you go.
[183:03.87]Be ready for Reach not to work because it has peer-to-peer connections.
[183:06.75]Oh, that's bad.
[183:08.57]We're gonna test it to make sure it does work.
[183:11.43]And if it doesn't, then we'll figure something out.
[183:16.76]It is... You know what?
[183:18.34]You are right.
[183:19.02]It is day one launch day of a brand new video game in 2019.
[183:26.02]It's guaranteed to not fucking work as intended for at least six or seven days.
[183:34.61]Technically day two, you're right.
[183:42.15]Halo, brand new video game.
[183:43.91]Well, you know what I mean, like a brand new launch.
[183:47.33]It's a launch of a game that has a lot of multiplayer connections.
[183:53.09]We'll see.
[183:53.33]See you tomorrow.
[183:54.97]Take care of yourselves.
[183:56.17]Thanks for joining me on the Hand Simulator.
[183:59.03]A medieval and visceral clean of detail.
[184:01.51]Triple stream.
[184:02.93]That's right, you got three streams in one today.
[184:07.03]Stream.
[184:07.73]Three separate streams in one stream.
[184:14.37]Now I know granted...
[184:17.07]It was the first hour and 40 minutes.
[184:21.66]For a lot of you, it was like having your teeth pulled without Novocaine.
[184:26.56]But it was fun.
[184:30.44]This stream's not even canon, that's right.
[184:31.96]This stream's not canon.
[184:34.18]This is an expanded universe stream, because I wasn't even gonna stream today.
[184:38.36]But I was like, you know what?
[184:40.04]Fuck it.
[184:40.48]Let's go.
[184:41.64]Let's play Hand Simulator and piss off an entire community.
[184:44.70]That sounds like a good idea.
[184:48.07]Good night, guys.
[184:48.57]See you tomorrow.
[184:50.43]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[184:52.43]Take care.
[185:01.38]Somebody said, didn't even try hand-simulated multiplayer.
[185:04.40]They were burning my house down.
[185:07.76]I had to leave.
[185:11.69]Maybe I'll play it again in multiplayer.
[185:14.43]Maybe you'll see it again.
[185:15.25]Fuck it.
[185:15.55]We'll do it.
[185:20.93]Halo Reach.
[185:23.19]Let's go.
[185:25.03]Play with Joel.
[185:25.85]Yeah, that's what's happening.
[185:28.92]Do you remember when me and Joel did the Gamer Challenge?
[185:32.06]We made the Gamer Challenge like a year ago.
[185:35.14]Let's go.
[185:36.34]Gamer Challenge activated.
[185:37.74]It's gonna be a co-op game.
[185:39.50]Let's go.
[185:40.52]What time?
[185:42.56]Somewhere... Oh.
[185:43.06]Let me see.
[185:44.26]I actually have it.
[185:47.28]This sauce will be correct.
[185:49.88]But just for you to know, to be the first to know.
[185:54.62]It's a year in the works.
[185:58.00]It'll be... So because we're working around both of our, like, streaming schedule, streaming times, it's gonna be somewhere around 4 PST.
[186:14.95]Alright.
[186:16.01]Joel doesn't have a schedule.
[186:16.87]Well, neither do I. So when you have two non-schedules run into each other, you've got to pick a time here.
[186:23.60]4 p.m.
[186:23.88]Pacific.
[186:24.24]See you tomorrow.
[186:25.18]Good night.
[186:25.84]Take care.
[186:26.86]Bye-bye.
