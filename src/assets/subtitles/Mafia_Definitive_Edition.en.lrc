[00:01.58]Why did that just change back to Saw?
[00:06.05]Oh, it's because my Streamlabs thing.
[00:07.75]It just took the stream from yesterday and said, this is the stream that's today.
[00:11.25]No, I got it.
[00:13.29]I got it.
[00:13.53]I updated it.
[00:14.07]I got it.
[00:14.39]Alright, I'm not supposed to be here.
[00:16.15]Hold on.
[00:17.11]Here I be.
[01:04.53]Okay, cool.
[01:07.53]Does saw again?
[01:08.45]It really shouldn't say saw.
[01:09.45]It should say city.
[01:15.47]Does it really matter?
[01:18.65]Does it actually matter?
[01:19.99]Okay, when you think about a title.
[01:23.27]Who am I trying to grab right now?
[01:25.47]Am I trying to grab you?
[01:26.59]Am I trying to have a cool title for you to come to the stream and be like, whoa, that's a crazy title.
[01:31.77]No, it's just a city.
[01:32.77]We're in a city.
[01:34.48]You know what you're going to get here.
[01:36.34]I'm going to crash the car five times in the first ten minutes.
[01:39.42]I'm going to run somebody over.
[01:40.28]I'm going to punch somebody in the face and get out of the car.
[01:43.10]And then the car's going to explode.
[01:45.07]And then I'm going to have to restart the game four times.
[01:47.35]Like, do I really need a title for that?
[01:50.19]I mean, if I could do that for the title, I would do that.
[01:53.95]No, you know what?
[01:54.47]No.
[01:55.13]Fuck that.
[01:55.91]I ain't going to do that today.
[01:57.95]I'm going to... In the first ten minutes, we're going to do the first mission.
[02:00.95]I'm not going to do anything weird.
[02:05.32]I'm sorry.
[02:05.68]All right, let's go.
[02:06.24]I don't know why.
[02:09.99]I'm sorry.
[02:10.47]I don't know why I did that.
[02:12.19]It was so awful.
[02:12.99]That was evil.
[02:15.81]Hey, is this a controller game, by the way?
[02:18.97]He's amped up.
[02:24.55]Evil clown.
[02:28.30]I am actually a little amped up.
[02:31.81]I'm looking forward to this.
[02:32.93]Guys, we get excited on this channel for third-person punching driving games.
[02:41.37]This is like my favorite thing in the world.
[02:47.64]But answer my question, if I can get an answer to that question.
[02:52.38]Is this a controller game?
[02:54.12]Or keyboard and mouse?
[02:54.92]I'm assuming it's probably controller, right?
[02:56.78]Third-person?
[02:57.38]Yeah, it's definitely a third-person game, so I'm going to use the controller.
[03:03.86]Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely controller.
[03:05.38]Okay.
[03:08.66]Are you guys ready for Mafia?
[03:13.09]How's that sound?
[03:13.61]Does that sound too low?
[03:19.89]It's rainy out today.
[03:20.73]You know, actually, I kind of missed this.
[03:25.99]It hasn't rained in Vegas in probably...
[03:29.84]I don't know.
[03:30.58]Can my computer not run this game?
[03:32.42]I think it just got a warning.
[03:37.42]I think OBS just gave me a warning saying that the encoding was too high.
[03:41.08]Can I not run this?
[03:41.86]Uh-oh.
[03:45.10]Find out.
[03:49.12]How much CPU is too much CPU to use for a game?
[03:53.54]I got to turn something down here.
[03:54.40]All right, options.
[03:55.66]Yeah, we got to turn this down.
[03:57.85]Dream is experiencing issues.
[04:00.31]Fuck.
[04:02.67]Okay, hold on.
[04:04.31]Hold on.
[04:04.83]I think I can fix this.
[04:05.51]Uh, how bad does it look right now?
[04:11.44]Is it alright now?
[04:12.52]Alright, display.
[04:17.22]Depth of field is off.
[04:18.32]Should I turn?
[04:19.76]Which one of these is taking up a ton of CPU power?
[04:24.24]It's a budget PC.
[04:26.93]Yeah, guys, I have a 1080 in here.
[04:28.39]I haven't upgraded my computer in six years.
[04:31.53]Is that bad?
[04:32.07]A 1080 is still fine.
[04:34.84]Shadow quality, low.
[04:37.92]Yeah, that's probably what was hogging all the CPU.
[04:42.46]It's not a pre-built, please.
[04:44.35]At least give me a little bit of credit.
[04:46.43]Somebody else built it for me.
[04:50.65]Which one else should I turn off?
[04:57.54]Everything else should be fine.
[04:59.40]What about volumetric effects?
[05:03.02]I think it should be fine.
[05:03.66]Alright, let's go.
[05:05.99]Back it up.
[05:10.29]Carcyclopedia.
[05:12.71]Motion blur?
[05:13.41]I turned it off, didn't I?
[05:14.23]Yeah, motion blur's off.
[05:17.21]Who the hell wants motion blur in their game?
[05:18.61]Alright, you ready?
[05:19.81]I'm not gonna go back and do Ratatouille again.
[05:23.14]I ate the disc.
[05:23.88]I ground it up and do a fucking spaghetti grinder and I put it into pasta.
[05:28.13]Put vegetation on high.
[05:29.36]Let's just see if this Walmart PC can handle it.
[05:31.52]Story mode.
[05:32.06]Here we go.
[05:32.44]Medium, classic, hard mode.
[05:38.04]Uh, no.
[05:38.96]Enemies are more dangerous.
[05:43.44]Police will respond to more crimes.
[05:44.68]Fewer UI indicators.
[05:46.08]Classic.
[05:48.08]Enemies are lethal.
[05:49.56]Police respond to more crimes.
[05:50.77]Fewer UI.
[05:52.23]Ammunition left in the clip is lost when reloading.
[05:54.85]No thanks.
[05:59.93]No, thanks.
[06:00.31]Play classic.
[06:04.12]No, I'm not doing classic.
[06:05.34]I'm terrible.
[06:06.54]I'm not going to get past the first boss.
[06:13.88]Can I change it in the game?
[06:14.86]Can I change it in mid-game?
[06:17.28]Enemies are lethal.
[06:22.23]Am I playing stalker?
[06:24.41]Why is this even in here?
[06:30.09]Auto, no manual transmission.
[06:32.09]Tutorials, that's fine.
[06:33.13]You can show them.
[06:34.39]Here we go.
[06:37.81]No, no, don't, no.
[06:41.14]Game is piss easy on anything below classic.
[06:44.36]Yeah, but I don't care about how hard the game is.
[06:46.58]I just want to drive around.
[06:48.44]Hey, this is not a, look.
[06:50.64]Maybe five, ten years ago I would have cared about that.
[06:53.84]Now I just want to hear the rain hit the side of my window.
[06:56.84]And the thunder.
[06:57.22]Thunder.
[06:59.10]Guys, I want to be able to just... You know what?
[07:00.38]I'm just going to turn this on at night.
[07:02.24]Later tonight and just sleep to this.
[07:04.44]This shit, I don't have to pay any more extra money.
[07:05.96]I already paid $40 for that.
[07:13.27]Here comes 2K Presents.
[07:16.43]Fucking 2K.
[07:17.77]WWE Battlegrounds.
[07:18.75]Get the fuck out of here.
[07:19.39]That game's stupid.
[07:20.07]I'm already angry.
[07:22.03]Alright, I'm going to be quiet.
[07:50.04]I'm just waiting for one of these birds to just crash into the camera that is our view.
[07:54.78]And it's Borderlands 4.
[07:56.47]And then No Rest for the Wicked starts playing again.
[08:16.21]This looks pretty good.
[08:18.85]This looks good.
[08:19.61]This looks really good.
[08:23.17]Well, my computer sucks and can't handle it, but it's still like, it's a little choppy for me, but it should be alright.
[08:40.08]It's pre-rendered.
[08:41.06]Oh.
[08:41.22]Now you get my hopes up.
[08:48.84]I'm just an annoying fucking drone.
[08:53.94]Ah, that's the neighborhood kid with his fucking drone.
[08:57.28]Watch out.
[09:02.73]He goes by somebody's head.
[09:05.33]Turns around, the guy's got a huge bald spot on the top of his head.
[09:10.97]You little bastard!
[09:23.36]This is really fucking loud.
[09:25.18]It's a cutscene loud.
[09:26.22]Don't worry.
[09:26.64]It'll be alright in a minute.
[09:29.80]Oh shit.
[09:30.83]Lost another drone.
[09:32.73]Lost another one.
[09:33.35]Oh shit.
[09:49.17]You know what's the saddest part about this video that we're watching right now that was filmed on one of those drones?
[09:55.48]It's unbelievable.
[09:56.38]Wow, what cinematography.
[09:57.58]How beautiful.
[09:58.08]You're gonna scroll down.
[09:58.88]840 views.
[10:00.28]840 views.
[10:13.09]Somebody said, you are so funny.
[10:15.17]Ban that person.
[10:15.91]I don't want to see them again.
[10:16.67]For at least a minute.
[10:26.15]I didn't think I was going to catch you say that.
[10:28.59]I only pick up the negative comments.
[10:30.24]I'm a streamer.
[10:33.04]I don't see any positive comments.
[10:34.82]I see four messages an hour.
[10:38.40]Hey, Tommy.
[10:40.22]Thomas Angelo.
[10:41.14]Detective Narman.
[10:47.21]You alone?
[10:48.55]No self-respecting.
[10:49.89]Just coming in here and that's the health inspector.
[10:52.87]What can I get you?
[10:53.89]Ah, just a coffee.
[10:55.17]Thanks.
[11:00.36]Dip your beak.
[11:01.37]Alright, I can't talk.
[11:02.47]No more talking.
[11:03.57]I had something to say there, but be quiet.
[11:06.61]So, you said on the phone you might have a proposition for me.
[11:13.23]That's right.
[11:14.99]Well, if you're looking to set up a gravy train, you called the wrong cop.
[11:18.40]I'm not looking for any associates.
[11:21.60]It's a fucking huge hands.
[11:22.84]Because I'm on the nut.
[11:26.04]Can't even pay for the coffee.
[11:29.36]But I got plenty to trade in.
[11:34.99]I just want them to keep lighting cigarettes.
[11:46.67]Just have like 12 cigarettes lit on the table.
[11:50.63]They just keep picking up different ones and smoking them.
[11:53.12]Case must be getting pretty cold by now.
[11:56.43]Or you got something might warm it up.
[11:59.03]Yeah, I might have something.
[12:01.59]And what's my end of the deal?
[12:03.39]You want money?
[12:04.61]Some sort of immunity?
[12:06.27]They don't even care who is with who is.
[12:08.41]I got people I need to protect.
[12:10.91]Ah, families.
[12:12.81]Always the Achilles heel, ain't it?
[12:14.19]All right, I'm all right.
[12:15.05]A sick ma or a wife and a letter of kids.
[12:18.03]Wife and daughter.
[12:20.15]No one else to watch your back, I'm guessing.
[12:21.97]Wouldn't be here otherwise.
[12:23.75]Pity that.
[12:25.69]We said a man needs friends if he's going to survive in this world Yeah well in my world the other way around I Have no idea what's happening all I know is cigarettes and I'm telling for a few days from cigarettes family not until I hear what you're trading so Are you talking or are you just killing time before they come for you?
[12:51.81]I?
[12:53.23]You think I'm on the run?
[12:54.80]Oh, I know it, Tommy.
[12:56.90]Look at you.
[12:58.38]Surely gassed.
[12:59.24]You haven't slept for days.
[13:01.50]Your neck's got to be aching from all that looking over your shoulder you're doing.
[13:05.80]No, the way I figure it is you got someone powerful mean on your tail and they ain't giving up.
[13:10.50]The annoying friend at the movie theater?
[13:14.03]You walk out that door without me, we both know you're not making it five steps.
[13:21.14]I know exactly what you're talking about dude.
[13:47.34]Your friend is talking during the previews and you're like, I hope he shuts the fuck up when the movie starts.
[13:51.62]And the movie starts, the first one minute goes by, he's still talking to you.
[13:54.60]It's like, god damn it, man.
[13:56.52]We're both here for the same reason.
[13:57.92]Please don't.
[14:01.04]That's me right now.
[14:05.15]What a hypocrite.
[14:06.47]This isn't even a fucking movie.
[14:08.51]Alright, I gotta rebuttal to that.
[14:09.75]I'm the twelfth streamer you've seen play this game.
[14:12.41]I'm like five days late.
[14:13.47]It was at the end of one of those shifts.
[14:16.00]That was loud.
[14:24.89]I don't watch anyone else.
[14:25.91]Oh, shit.
[14:26.65]I'll be quiet.
[14:29.03]We've waited for you.
[14:30.23]It's loud.
[14:34.66]It's too loud.
[14:39.00]Imagine being in a movie theater.
[14:41.66]It's too loud!
[14:42.44]It's too loud!
[14:43.36]It's supposed to be loud, you fucking assholes!
[14:45.34]Shut up!
[14:46.00]It's THX!
[14:49.44]Oh.
[14:51.58]Okay.
[15:06.80]Let me break your immersion for a second.
[15:08.94]Sorry, this doesn't happen in movies, but it's happening here.
[15:14.27]Is this how Infinity War starts?
[15:17.23]I know what it's like to loop.
[15:30.92]Ooze.
[15:31.86]What are you doing?
[15:32.60]I know so desperately that you'll ride.
[15:34.98]How do I drive?
[15:35.77]They catch up, we're dead.
[15:37.89]Alright, where we going?
[15:38.97]Find ways to lose your tail.
[15:40.49]I don't have any tutorials.
[15:41.90]Oh, there we go.
[15:42.30]Why is this guy- I feel like I'm driving a toy car.
[15:45.64]Is that us?
[15:46.78]Hold LT to slow down.
[15:47.98]Yeah, brake.
[16:09.57]Route to Destination is showing up.
[16:10.57]Wait, we have GPS in, like, the 1930s?
[16:11.99]That's kind of... Alright, I'm glad that that would remake.
[16:14.83]The graphics are too good.
[16:16.52]It's hard to drive.
[16:17.32]The graphics are too good.
[16:40.17]I'm turning the graphics on low.
[16:41.29]It actually is hard to do this.
[16:47.38]Drive to Central Island.
[16:50.56]Can I change the camera angle?
[16:51.52]Turn limiter off.
[16:53.89]What?
[16:54.55]How do I change the camera angle?
[16:55.51]I don't like this view.
[16:56.21]I want it to be a little closer.
[17:06.07]What?
[17:06.95]What did he come up?
[17:08.41]I know some shortcuts that'll slow him down.
[17:10.59]I don't care how you do it.
[17:11.92]What happened?
[17:12.40]Shake him off.
[17:13.64]Lose your tail.
[17:14.38]Is this encoding lag?
[17:15.70]No, it's my computer, actually.
[17:17.18]We're going to have to turn the graphics down.
[17:18.66]That was your shortcut.
[17:23.88]I lost him, didn't I?
[17:27.08]These guys really don't like you, do they?
[17:29.84]No, I said I wasn't going to hit anybody.
[17:30.99]Good.
[17:31.35]It happens.
[17:33.49]Master Shake?
[17:33.99]We've been yapping, Polly.
[17:37.58]Alright, find ways to lose your tail.
[17:39.18]Hold on.
[17:39.52]It's still way... We gotta figure this out right now.
[17:41.73]Hold on.
[17:43.87]It's still fucking too loud.
[17:45.65]And we gotta put it on a little bit lower than this.
[17:48.07]Geometry detail, we can put it on medium.
[17:50.07]Decals, low.
[17:51.61]Medium.
[17:54.74]Look, you don't order a rare steak.
[17:56.46]You don't order a well-done steak.
[17:57.72]You order a fucking medium steak.
[17:59.86]That's my reasoning for this.
[18:05.42]Better?
[18:07.62]I don't know.
[18:08.14]What do you mean you don't order a medium steak?
[18:15.11]That's what everybody does.
[18:30.68]Okay, that was pretty funny.
[18:32.84]I have to do that again?
[18:33.62]What happens if I back through it?
[18:35.16]It is Master Shake.
[18:35.84]Is it the same actor?
[18:36.74]It is.
[18:36.90]What's his name?
[18:37.82]Dana Carvey?
[18:38.28]No, not Dana Carvey.
[18:39.88]What's his name?
[19:00.08]All right, hold on.
[19:00.52]I have to try something.
[19:10.03]Come on, do it.
[19:17.25]Yes.
[19:21.78]They must have sent word out.
[19:23.54]There's more and more of them.
[19:26.24]Video games.
[19:27.38]Aren't they great?
[19:28.86]Back to the neighborhood.
[19:32.85]Oh, shit.
[19:36.05]Didn't kill anybody.
[19:37.49]Don't shoot that lady.
[19:38.30]What are you doing?
[19:44.10]Custom character creator, is there?
[19:46.20]All right.
[19:46.84]I don't want to do it yet because we're right at the end of the mission.
[19:53.69]But if I hit triangle or Y, will I just fall out of the car?
[19:58.33]The bridge is up, ain't it?
[20:00.99]Yeah, we can make it.
[20:03.80]That's Carl.
[20:04.68]That was Carl from Aqua Teen.
[20:06.54]It's Aqua Teen Mafia Force.
[20:13.86]Never done that before.
[20:15.75]Me neither.
[20:16.95]Okay, so little Italy.
[20:18.75]Did it.
[20:19.47]Now, your night's not over.
[20:23.77]I hope somebody just chimes in and just say, yeah, let's get over there, man.
[20:27.92]It's me, Beatron.
[20:31.26]That'd be so awesome if there's a guy that talks like that that's in my friend group.
[20:37.62]Hold on.
[20:38.57]I don't like this.
[20:40.31]Did I change this?
[20:42.23]Hold on a second.
[20:43.73]Vehicle.
[20:44.27]There we are.
[20:44.99]Okay.
[20:45.27]Vehicle camera pitch.
[20:46.27]Does that make it better?
[20:46.95]That didn't do anything.
[20:49.22]I made it worse.
[20:49.76]Eh.
[20:58.06]And 1080 TI.
[20:59.90]Should I put this at like 720p?
[21:02.66]Okay, we're close.
[21:04.80]Shit, my... Wait, should I... I don't have a... What about a graphics card update?
[21:07.64]I haven't updated my drivers in probably three years.
[21:09.74]Should I do that?
[21:10.12]It's in the area's place.
[21:12.35]Yeah, that's the one.
[21:19.71]Lock the frame rate to 30.
[21:21.65]What for?
[21:22.07]Let's see.
[21:24.01]You want a little something from the Don or not?
[21:34.31]Is it CPU or GPU?
[21:35.35]I don't know.
[21:37.29]It seems like during cutscenes, it's fine.
[21:39.19]But just driving really fast is when my computer starts to hang a little.
[21:53.87]Do a driver update.
[21:55.23]But if I do a driver update, the screen turns off.
[21:59.25]CPU is the problem?
[22:00.69]Yeah, probably.
[22:22.20]Don't do a smash brothers thing for you service did already any damage to your car this makes us square I'm sure it's more than enough Good
[22:37.02]I've refreshed the page and I got a Travis Scott burger advertisement.
[22:47.83]Yes.
[22:49.13]That's one of four ads on Twitch right now.
[22:52.83]Hey, you want to go to McDonald's and get a hamburger with bacon on it?
[22:56.61]We'll get it.
[22:57.21]This matter stays between us.
[23:01.45]Anyone ask where you got that money?
[23:03.39]You want it at poker.
[23:06.82]Scratches on your car.
[23:10.04]You swerved.
[23:12.16]To keep from hitting a little old lady.
[23:13.86]You got it?
[23:15.05]That actually did happen.
[23:15.89]I just barely missed her.
[23:18.89]So many bullet holes.
[23:31.93]Wait, that's a different franchise.
[23:34.45]When I opened the envelope, I thought I had a heart attack.
[23:38.41]Enough to fix the cap.
[23:40.85]Nearly enough to buy a new one.
[23:43.53]I thought about what Sam said about work.
[23:46.35]I wasn't interested.
[23:48.25]The money was good, sure, but I didn't want to get in with criminals.
[23:52.36]I just wanted to open the fridge and there's like a hundred packs of cigarettes in the fridge.
[23:57.02]And the freezer.
[23:57.66]So, right there.
[23:59.26]Back then, I was out.
[24:07.41]Hey, Chris Weed Piano, thanks for $50.
[24:10.45]5,000 bits from Chris Weed Piano.
[24:12.37]Jerma, could you tell me when you're doing Weed Week?
[24:15.75]There's no such thing.
[24:17.41]But that's a lot of money.
[24:19.43]Thanks for the 50 bucks, dude.
[24:20.69]That's a fucking extreme amount of money.
[24:27.13]Alright, 1930.
[24:30.55]After that night with Salieri's guys, I was back working as soon as I could.
[24:35.75]I think it's the lighting.
[24:37.87]I gotta turn the lights down.
[24:38.91]I need to get a fucking 3080.
[24:41.51]Alright, here we go.
[24:42.18]First time on foot.
[24:47.78]What's the punch button?
[25:01.64]Wait a minute, wait.
[25:03.40]Hold on, lady.
[25:05.26]I'm currently trying to get my graphics to look okay.
[25:07.12]I'm going to turn on V-Sync.
[25:11.90]I'm going to drop the FOV to like 85.
[25:13.72]I'm going to put the vegetation direct lighting to low.
[25:22.16]Alright, there we go.
[25:22.78]There we go.
[25:27.06]That's pretty smooth.
[25:29.10]That's pretty smooth.
[25:30.68]I'm ready.
[25:34.03]All right.
[25:34.35]St.
[25:34.55]Michael's Church.
[25:35.03]Turn the speed limiter on.
[25:38.95]Why would I want to put the speed limiter... Motorcycle!
[25:42.43]Motorcycle!
[25:43.56]Motorcycle!
[25:44.00]Motorcycle!
[25:46.80]Oh, wait.
[25:47.10]I was doing a mission right.
[26:06.35]I can't do that with a lady in the car.
[26:09.81]A cab driver is like, oh yeah, take me to 42nd Street, please.
[26:13.86]Sure thing.
[26:15.30]Motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle!
[26:16.70]And they run the guy over.
[26:19.04]What a fucking psycho.
[26:19.94]You have to obey the rules.
[26:33.70]Run on the speed limiter.
[26:34.98]Oh, I see.
[26:35.50]I don't want that on.
[26:40.91]Get.
[26:41.13]I don't honk the horn.
[26:43.79]No.
[27:01.89]My milkshake brings all the... It's in every fucking game, I think.
[27:05.58]I can't get away from it.
[27:14.33]I can't get away from it.
[27:15.33]What do you want me to say?
[27:16.05]A goose laugh?
[27:35.96]Whoa!
[27:37.14]Drive carefully.
[27:37.82]Respect the law.
[27:43.69]I am.
[27:44.03]I'm doing a good job.
[27:50.21]Game's too good looking.
[27:51.27]I like games that have like 2008 graphics, not like 2020.
[27:53.94]I should just play the original one.
[28:04.23]I'm complaining about how it's good it looks and how much it's bad it runs on my computer.
[28:09.27]I could just play the original Mafia.
[28:10.83]I ain't gonna do that though.
[28:15.11]I thought everybody smoked in like 1930.
[28:39.86]There is no punch person button.
[28:43.56]Run her over.
[28:51.93]I can't.
[28:52.47]I'm not going to run her over.
[28:54.99]Search the streets for fares.
[28:56.55]Okay.
[28:57.33]This is just crazy taxi.
[29:11.51]Is there a person here?
[29:12.41]You need a fare?
[29:18.28]You?
[29:22.66]Anybody need a ride?
[29:23.62]I'm looking for Dave.
[29:28.27]Lift for Dave.
[29:29.07]Fucking goddamn.
[29:32.73]Hey, looking for Dave.
[29:38.77]Your ride has canceled.
[29:47.43]Oh, wait.
[29:47.81]They can't stay.
[29:49.39]It looks like I did that on purpose.
[30:06.62]Oh, here you are.
[30:07.24]Come on in.
[30:10.37]Where are you going, sir?
[30:16.97]Where can I take you?
[30:17.55]Art Gallery.
[30:18.31]Get there quick.
[30:19.01]Do they have handbrakes back in the 30s?
[30:23.54]Didn't turn off the graphics.
[30:24.38]Oh, right.
[30:24.66]Hold on.
[30:24.92]Let me try that.
[30:49.50]It didn't change anything.
[30:50.14]I think it's just the game.
[30:51.16]Yeah, that didn't change anything.
[30:51.98]Turn off the visuals.
[30:52.74]It's the driver.
[30:53.84]Actually, to be honest, it looks fine.
[31:17.83]Yeah, it does.
[31:21.05]CPU can't handle the game and stream.
[31:23.03]What the hell?
[31:25.94]See, I got a six core CPU.
[31:27.58]The thing was expensive back in like 2014.
[31:29.10]I gotta hurry up.
[31:45.87]I'm upgrading my CPU and GPU and motherboard.
[31:48.27]I'm just going to get a new computer, whatever.
[32:01.24]I'm going to get a 64-core computer.
[32:08.89]That just spawned.
[32:09.83]That taxi just spawned.
[32:14.33]Pull up in front of the gallery.
[32:19.97]Alright, get out.
[32:20.41]Get the fuck out.
[32:22.81]There's 50 cents.
[32:23.79]Don't spend it all at once.
[32:26.11]I'll try not to.
[32:31.43]When are you going to do 1080p streams?
[32:32.75]I don't know.
[32:33.23]That's a good question.
[32:34.27]Every fair today has been a son of a bitch.
[32:38.78]On to the next.
[32:44.80]GTA 5 runs good on this computer, and this, like, looks the same.
[32:49.32]This is running fine, but, you know, you get the idea.
[32:53.30]I'm not gonna do 1080p.
[32:54.28]No, there's no reason to.
[32:58.00]GTA 5 was in 2012.
[32:59.50]Yeah, but... Fuck, that's right.
[33:04.00]Alright, I'm getting a new computer tomorrow.
[33:07.36]I'm getting a new computer tomorrow.
[33:09.28]Where are we going?
[33:10.60]Little Italy, 21st Street.
[33:18.28]That's impossible.
[33:23.06]Great deal.
[33:28.45]Okay.
[33:29.11]You can do that.
[33:30.81]Wait.
[33:31.33]Wait.
[33:31.53]Run, run, run, run, run.
[33:32.43]How do you run?
[33:32.83]How do you sprint?
[33:37.31]Oh, shit.
[33:41.57]I'm back.
[33:41.91]I'm back.
[33:42.26]I'm back.
[33:42.54]I'm back.
[33:42.82]I'm back.
[33:43.38]Where were we?
[33:45.69]Holy shit, dude!
[33:51.98]He actually waited, yeah.
[33:53.08]It's the handbrake button.
[33:54.54]Stop and pay the fine?
[33:55.72]What fine?
[33:56.20]Alright.
[33:56.40]I'll pay the fine.
[33:56.98]Wait, under arrest?
[34:21.28]How much is a fine?
[34:27.68]Like, how much is it?
[34:28.50]Ten cents?
[34:29.53]How much is a fine?
[34:36.67]That's a whole dollar!
[34:38.65]Wait, how much money do I have?
[34:50.18]How do I get in the car?
[34:52.66]Wait.
[34:54.27]Oh.
[34:54.95]Alright, you go first.
[34:58.05]I don't want you seeing me do anything illegal.
[34:59.27]What's the speed limit?
[35:00.15]30?
[35:00.25]Oh, shit.
[35:01.83]You have to do the speed limit.
[35:03.91]Sure is.
[35:16.98]That's kind of funny that you can do that.
[35:18.40]You can put a speed limiter on your car.
[35:20.40]You know what it is?
[35:28.32]It's rendering the buildings.
[35:29.12]You don't even need to render these buildings.
[35:31.16]Just make them, like, bitmap cardboard cutouts and the game will be fine.
[35:35.65]I don't give a shit about the fire exits over there.
[35:37.29]You can just remove them.
[35:39.25]This is unnecessary, uh... Oh!
[35:43.83]I beeped at somebody!
[35:44.85]What?! !
[35:48.11]What, you ca- Beeping is illegal?
[35:49.75]No, fuck that.
[35:51.97]I'm outta here.
[35:55.97]Oh, shit!
[35:57.15]Foiled again!
[36:04.19]I beeped at a pedestrian.
[36:05.55]Alright, hold on.
[36:06.89]I gotta- Are you kidding me?
[36:10.37]Right at the fucking end.
[36:13.11]That's disturbing the peace?
[36:16.11]So don't ever use your horn.
[36:19.58]Wait, so you're telling me.
[36:21.16]Doing this.
[36:21.44]Is it going to get me arrested?
[36:23.10]I hear a siren already.
[36:23.88]Don't loud noises in 1930.
[36:25.12]But never enough of them.
[36:50.58]This isn't GTA.
[36:51.30]That's true.
[36:52.02]That's true.
[37:07.19]Yeah, I'm gonna stream at 900p.
[37:09.65]It's gonna look crystal clear at 60 FPS.
[37:13.33]I'm gonna get a 3090.
[37:13.89]I'm gonna be a psycho and get a 3090.
[37:17.08]And the 64 fucking core, like, 8 gigahertz processor.
[37:20.26]I'm gonna be able to... NASA's gonna be calling me to fucking CPU usage.
[37:29.27]I'm gonna be routing, like, air traffic control to this computer.
[37:35.73]It's gonna be so powerful.
[37:40.74]Put the limiter on.
[37:41.24]I don't want to get arrested.
[37:45.07]It's illegal to drive in this lane, right?
[37:46.87]Or is it?
[37:47.19]Yeah.
[37:52.34]Monkey ball in 4K.
[37:53.40]Alright, we're almost there.
[38:10.09]Get a sponsor so you get a free PC.
[38:12.13]Alright.
[38:13.19]Excuse me.
[38:13.83]Can I have a free computer?
[38:16.11]I'm a streamer.
[38:17.64]That means I get a free computer, right?
[38:19.30]That's the email I sent.
[38:32.05]Hey, uh, I just was hitting you up because I'm a streamer and deserve a $5,000 PC for free.
[38:38.31]Thank you for your time.
[38:40.59]Respectfully yours, Jeremy Elbertson.
[38:48.11]I don't remember this person.
[38:58.14]Do I get a bat though?
[38:59.02]I'm so excited for the bat.
[39:01.77]Let's get him?
[39:02.29]Oh!
[39:02.37]Why to vault?
[39:34.06]Nice, okay, go, go, go, go, go.
[39:38.38]I'm on classic mode, this is not a joke.
[39:46.53]We've got YouTube tutorial music in the background.
[39:53.77]Run!
[39:59.43]By the way, all videos with this song behind it are less than three minutes long.
[40:05.56]They're like two and a half, one and a half minutes long.
[40:07.64]It's a quick DIY.
[40:20.58]It's scripted.
[40:21.92]You were supposed to do that.
[40:23.66]Look at this.
[40:29.64]That triple jump.
[40:31.06]How you doing, kid?
[40:37.72]Dino, Lou.
[40:39.91]You got business with the Don?
[40:42.31]Nah, we're just trying to talk to that cabbie over there, that's all.
[40:47.14]Is that right?
[40:48.24]Yeah.
[40:49.28]Well, this here is the Don's favorite driver.
[40:51.72]So anything you got to say to him, you can say to me.
[40:55.33]Is that right, pal?
[40:57.03]I'll tell you something, pal.
[40:57.81]We ain't leaving empty-handed, that's for sure.
[40:59.79]Well, then maybe you ain't leaving at all.
[41:03.59]Okay.
[41:07.09]Bad graphics.
[41:09.05]Leave me alone.
[41:09.63]See you boys around.
[41:14.28]Let's go, Lou.
[41:15.94]The lighting is way too hard.
[41:17.38]The face animations are bad.
[41:20.70]Stop laughing at me!
[41:21.72]I'm gonna update my graphics card.
[41:27.31]I'll be back in like 10 minutes.
[41:28.35]Why does it look like Toy Story 1?
[41:30.55]It doesn't.
[41:31.53]It looks like Toy Story 2.
[41:45.52]My computer is going to be a monster.
[41:49.17]It's going to be insane.
[41:50.45]I've waited long enough.
[41:51.29]It's been six years.
[41:52.03]It's been five years and five and a half years.
[41:53.85]I've got to get a new computer or something.
[41:55.11]I have to get a new graphics card.
[41:56.53]I can't just have a... 1080 is not going to take me forever.
[42:01.05]As much as I want it to.
[42:07.23]I can't believe that a 1080 is worthy of Toy Story 1 graphics.
[42:10.89]That's fucking crazy.
[42:12.74]What do they call you, son?
[42:14.20]Thomas.
[42:15.76]Thomas Angelo, sir.
[42:18.28]Frank told me you ran into some trouble?
[42:20.52]Yes, sir.
[42:21.92]My cab got smashed up pretty good.
[42:23.95]Morello's thugs went after him by the kind of time he helped us.
[42:28.35]This, uh, taxi, that your livelihood?
[42:32.61]Yes, sir.
[42:33.87]I feel a sense of responsibility here.
[42:37.81]So I'm going to set you up with a small loan.
[42:39.53]Enough to get that cabin yours fixed up.
[42:41.29]No, no, no, thanks.
[42:41.79]No, thanks.
[42:42.07]I want a loan from a mafia guy.
[42:43.61]No, thank you.
[42:43.93]I'm not looking for a handout.
[42:46.60]This is when you just rip the fuck out of the seat and run out as fast as you can and run.
[42:49.36]I just want a shot at the bastards who wrecked my cab.
[42:55.36]You hear that, Frank?
[42:57.12]The kid wants my permission to get into a fight.
[42:59.75]Yes, I heard.
[43:03.75]Okay, Tommy Angelo.
[43:06.16]All of Morello's girls hang out at a bar he owns.
[43:08.58]Paul, you know the place.
[43:10.18]Sure do, boss.
[43:11.22]It's not just you.
[43:13.22]This game is really stressful on the 1080.
[43:16.50]Damn.
[43:18.56]Go smash up a few tin cans.
[43:20.81]Send Morello a message.
[43:22.47]He can't rough up hard-working Joes in my neighborhood without getting a black eye.
[43:26.77]Thank you, Mr. Salieri.
[43:28.77]I won't let you down.
[43:34.53]People with better computers than you have frame rate problems.
[43:36.73]Oh.
[43:38.06]Oh, so the game sucks.
[43:40.92]Okay, let's just check it.
[43:47.50]I should turn the graphics back up.
[43:48.54]It's not just a me problem.
[43:50.34]Okay, so there is just frame rate problems in the game.
[43:59.06]Okay, I got you.
[44:00.96]Well, let's go to at least Toy Story 2.
[44:05.18]Everything's on low.
[44:06.10]Fuck.
[44:09.04]Okay, let's do medium.
[44:10.46]I'll do medium.
[44:11.90]But keep lighting.
[44:12.64]Fuck lighting.
[44:13.24]We're on max?
[44:20.01]What are you trying to do to me?
[44:23.99]Optimal?
[44:26.93]Oh, that looks kind of good.
[44:31.48]Okay.
[44:35.70]Look around the bar.
[44:37.54]Can I talk to people?
[44:39.02]Oh, what's this?
[44:40.30]Prohibition here to stay.
[44:41.64]If they left.
[44:42.14]Update your drivers.
[45:05.04]But then I have to turn the stream off.
[45:06.34]And that's going to be a pain in the ass.
[45:09.31]Ooh, what's this?
[45:16.61]We can wait.
[45:17.93]Let me just check and see if I have... Hold on.
[45:21.36]Just do it when you have to pee.
[45:22.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:23.00]That's what I'll do.
[45:23.58]When I have to pee, I'm going to update my drivers.
[45:27.50]I wonder if it'll turn the stream off.
[45:28.92]It might not.
[45:31.50]It takes like 10 minutes.
[45:32.28]Yeah.
[45:32.51]Well, on a break, I'll do it.
[45:33.77]Not right now.
[45:39.02]pretty cool though what am I doing it said I was looking around the bar anyways I got places to be okay come through this way I'll take it if any first he's allowed gonna be a restart anyways all right what's he do we go see him whenever we need to do any uh
[46:05.23]How did the frame rate get better when I put the graphics on as high as they can go?
[46:08.59]Does that make any sense?
[46:18.28]Optimal.
[46:20.80]Oh.
[46:24.34]Turn up the game audio?
[46:27.50]I will.
[46:32.87]Who are you?
[46:33.75]What are you doing here?
[46:35.67]Yes.
[46:35.79]Finally.
[46:36.27]Yes.
[47:00.70]Hey, no thanks.
[47:05.74]I don't drink.
[47:06.32]And you look back and forth.
[47:09.71]And everybody does that exact same fake weird laugh.
[47:12.37]Alright, I got molotovs.
[47:13.59]Wait, there's a thing on the table.
[47:28.00]Can I have your card?
[47:28.76]This is pornography.
[47:34.08]Was it?
[47:34.92]I don't know.
[47:40.85]I couldn't tell.
[47:43.59]Guys.
[47:44.65]Did I ever play the original Mafia?
[47:46.43]Like a long time ago, yeah.
[47:51.15]Not really, though.
[47:51.91]I feel like I played it on this stream.
[47:56.94]I played one of them on this stream, didn't I?
[47:58.40]Mafia 2?
[48:03.79]Mafia 3?
[48:04.07]Oh, Mafia 3, yeah.
[48:04.77]Hey, genius!
[48:11.11]Get your head out of your ass!
[48:12.87]What the fuck, dear P-P-Polly?
[48:15.66]You can't just sneak up on a guy like that.
[48:19.76]I'm sorry, Ralphie.
[48:20.86]I'm just busting your balls.
[48:25.61]See, you're still a limping.
[48:27.07]Guess we got two cripples working here.
[48:29.51]That kind of looks like me.
[48:31.61]We ain't nothing alike.
[48:33.95]You got that, Ralph?
[48:35.47]Show up, Polly.
[48:37.95]Tommy.
[48:39.85]Tommy Angelo.
[48:41.25]Good to meet you.
[48:42.67]Like I said, Ralphie here's a crack tank.
[48:46.43]Well, you bring him a stolen car, he'll make it yours.
[48:48.89]There's only one voice actor?
[48:50.55]We got a job to do.
[48:52.03]We need some wheels.
[48:54.51]That would be pretty funny actually if it was one person caught that You got you catch that with one hand you do a two-handed clap catch that's not cool looking that you don't look cool doing that Holy shit Trying to pull giving us this motor
[49:21.67]I want to show you something about the good life and you're driving something my mom could have bought 20 years ago.
[49:26.05]If I know Ralph, he probably got it taken out of our yard.
[49:30.18]Yeah, the car's fine.
[49:31.66]It's good to get a change from the cab.
[49:33.80]Don't drive fast.
[49:35.06]This thing's a tin can.
[49:38.02]Mega lol Disney game.
[49:39.89]Is that whiskey back there in the truck?
[49:41.41]Put it on the frame limiter.
[49:45.11]You guys deal in broad daylight.
[49:47.44]Normally, nah.
[49:49.10]There's no such thing as traffic lights.
[49:51.66]How the fuck do people drive?
[49:54.73]Morello, the guy whose cars you gotta drive?
[49:57.45]Oh, shit.
[49:57.95]I'm in the wrong lane.
[49:58.75]Arrest this guy.
[50:00.49]He's beeping at me.
[50:01.35]We're okay.
[50:02.81]As long as we're careful.
[50:04.97]An eye over our shoulder.
[50:07.07]Some of the Canadian whiskey that comes through.
[50:09.62]You want a bottle?
[50:10.74]Dude, the game actually, like, improved.
[50:14.02]I turned on the graphics.
[50:15.26]I'm no big drinker.
[50:16.82]I used to tip back bathtub.
[50:18.28]I didn't just stuffed up a bunch of crumpled pieces of paper into my CPU bottleneck.
[50:22.36]That stuff's no good for you.
[50:24.30]You don't have to go blind now, though.
[50:27.25]You got a line in the good stuff.
[50:29.75]That's good of you.
[50:30.79]Thanks.
[50:32.44]No, the 1080's fine.
[50:33.54]We're good.
[50:34.04]Silky smooth.
[50:35.04]Alright, take the limiter off.
[50:36.88]No cops.
[50:37.50]Let's go.
[50:37.86]Ha ha ha!
[51:01.03]What?
[51:03.33]But you don't understand!
[51:04.99]He's gonna do that at some point.
[51:06.25]He's gonna do the High Master's Shag Voice!
[51:08.15]And we're gonna all laugh.
[51:09.01]I laughed.
[51:10.15]Yeah, I did too.
[51:23.48]We all did.
[51:24.80]If you didn't... You must be immune to fun.
[51:30.71]I'm going to just lean back in the chair and went, ugh.
[51:35.83]And they tried to click the X, but they misclicked twice and opened up a new tab, and that pissed them off even more.
[51:42.89]And they're not coming back to the stream.
[51:44.13]Like, they clicked wrong.
[51:46.76]They, like, minimized the window or something in a fit of rage, and they're just like, fuck, I'm not coming back.
[51:53.56]Hey, they'll be back.
[51:54.54]Don't worry.
[51:59.01]Oh, that was illegal.
[51:59.77]No, no, no.
[52:00.21]Right on red.
[52:00.83]That's okay.
[52:01.13]There's a guy there.
[52:16.52]You can't turn right on red in New York City?
[52:19.06]You can't?
[52:19.68]Oh.
[52:19.82]Well, alright.
[52:20.34]This is not New York City.
[52:21.12]Oh, okay.
[52:21.74]This is Chicago.
[52:45.94]Right.
[52:46.50]Okay, not New York City.
[52:48.54]Every game where a guy is in the mafia does not take place in New York City.
[52:53.07]As much as, apparently, I think that it is.
[52:56.13]It's not Chicago either.
[53:00.83]What is it then?
[53:01.39]Where the hell are we?
[53:09.11]This is not Boston.
[53:12.85]I know what Boston looks like, guys.
[53:14.11]It doesn't look like this.
[53:16.27]And you might say, what are you doing?
[53:17.81]Boston's looked the same since 1930.
[53:20.06]Why are you coming with?
[53:21.88]To see if you get shot.
[53:24.70]Nothing has changed.
[53:25.38]It's a fictional city.
[53:32.34]Alright, follow up.
[53:36.78]Okay, there's like a gravity hole over here that I just got pulled into.
[53:41.82]Alright, press right stick to sneak.
[53:44.78]Yeah, like that.
[53:52.35]When do I get to use the bat?
[54:02.19]Austin's a fake city.
[54:05.42]Okay.
[54:07.68]Over the gate, onto the roof.
[54:08.56]You got it.
[54:08.88]Holy shit, Polly!
[54:12.18]That was fucking crazy!
[54:16.79]We gotta get you in the Olympics!
[54:28.36]Oh, I'm Tommy.
[54:29.33]Right.
[54:29.69]Okay, whatever.
[54:31.15]Alright, I'm up here.
[54:33.79]Hey!
[54:34.87]What the hell you doing?
[54:35.87]What do you mean, what am I doing?
[54:37.93]I mean what I say.
[54:39.67]What the hell you doing back there?
[54:43.43]How do I jump down?
[54:45.69]Keep distracting him.
[54:55.46]Christ, Tom.
[54:57.22]You got seen.
[55:01.25]What does that matter?
[55:02.25]I hate doing it quiet, too.
[55:06.81]Why does that even matter?
[55:07.53]What do you mean?
[55:08.25]Who cares?
[55:08.73]Oh, no, Polly.
[55:10.97]I cut his legs off.
[55:14.01]Now, let's get to these cars.
[55:16.13]Take it back and start swinging.
[55:19.13]Oh shit, there's a weapon wheel.
[55:20.59]Oh my god, there's a hitman feature.
[55:22.03]This game is cool.
[55:23.12]Hold on.
[55:23.86]What do I do with them?
[55:26.36]Use the bat, Tom.
[55:32.42]Okay, use the bat.
[55:33.12]There's a weapon wheel?
[55:36.10]Oh shit.
[55:37.28]It just got fucking real.
[55:40.38]Oh my god, the game just got real.
[55:41.86]This might be one of my favorite games of the year.
[55:44.79]Just because I just watched.
[55:45.81]That animation is all I care about.
[55:51.70]This is a crow hop swing.
[55:53.20]Oh, this is going to be great.
[55:54.96]Okay, let's go.
[55:56.18]No, no, no, no, no.
[55:58.92]Is there a Batman?
[55:59.98]In the head.
[56:25.14]Molotov?
[56:26.40]Oh shit.
[56:27.32]It's right bumper and then you... Oh man, this game's fun!
[56:31.06]This game's fun!
[56:36.14]Holy shit!
[56:40.96]Okay, you cannot do that to a friend of yours and have your friend trust you ever again.
[56:50.70]Oh, man, I was just messing around.
[56:51.82]Uh, no, you weren't, man.
[56:54.84]Like, I don't think we can hang out anymore.
[56:56.21]It's right near Morello's place.
[56:59.25]Don't bring in the wrong people.
[57:01.25]Old ways are the best ways.
[57:03.43]It was intent behind that swing.
[57:05.41]Straight through the gate.
[57:06.55]We gotta get out of here before the bulls show.
[57:09.63]Gotta reload!
[57:11.43]Go!
[57:12.55]Don't let him get away!
[57:14.93]Come back, you bastards!
[57:20.39]Watch out, lady.
[57:20.77]He is in the ignition.
[57:22.21]Oh, wow.
[57:22.51]This game is really cool.
[57:25.43]Oh, sick jump.
[57:26.85]Yeah.
[57:27.21]Are they going to do it?
[57:28.11]No.
[57:46.17]What's a bicycle for?
[57:46.93]Oh, no, no, no, no, that's handcuffs.
[57:52.01]On the right.
[57:55.71]What's the handbrake, dude?
[57:57.00]I don't know what the handbrake is.
[57:58.36]Fuck, what's the handbrake?
[58:02.80]Does anybody know?
[58:03.32]Is it B?
[58:04.96]It's B, okay.
[58:15.25]Didn't expect me to hit the brakes.
[58:18.67]It's not Y. Y falls out of car.
[58:23.89]They're right behind us, dude.
[58:26.88]Hey!
[58:40.98]I feel like I'm playing Mario Kart and someone's trying to make me stay in second place.
[58:45.22]Get away from me.
[58:46.13]Bingo.
[58:46.85]That's pretty clean.
[58:53.09]Did he do it clean?
[58:53.81]Nope.
[58:56.95]Press X real quick.
[58:58.01]No, I know that does.
[58:58.99]Alright, are we good?
[59:10.50]There's a car behind us.
[59:13.45]What a joke of a streamer.
[59:14.67]Hey.
[59:14.81]Is that a cop right there?
[59:19.27]What's the blue thing right there?
[59:20.39]Is that a cop?
[59:22.59]Blip on the minimap.
[59:23.27]Blue blip.
[59:23.73]What is that?
[59:24.03]Yes.
[59:27.56]Yeah.
[59:27.78]Okay.
[59:27.92]Okay.
[59:28.04]Okay.
[59:28.24]All right.
[59:28.56]We're almost out.
[59:39.41]I wanna run this guy over so bad.
[59:40.47]Okay, I'm good.
[59:41.55]Blue Blip is a Dunkin Donuts location.
[59:58.64]You know what's funny?
[60:00.24]I know for a fact that what you're saying is a joke, but there definitely is a Find the Dunkin' Nearest You app.
[60:09.47]Why would you ever want that app?
[60:10.78]What's it for?
[60:11.58]Why would you ever need to know that?
[60:13.66]Drive one mile in any direction in New England.
[60:17.38]Why do you need an app to tell you where to go?
[60:19.97]That's like being like, hmm, can I find a McDonald's anywhere at some point in the next 20 minutes?
[60:28.30]Yes, you can.
[60:29.46]Just drive straight.
[60:31.62]On any road in the world, you will find one.
[60:36.49]You never got to beat up Dino's pals and take his motor?
[60:39.31]If you ever feel like going to McDonald's, don't even put it in your GPS.
[60:41.47]There's no reason to.
[60:43.01]Pick a road.
[60:43.55]When I got squeezed by the cops?
[60:44.94]You'll find it.
[60:45.92]Knew never to squeal.
[60:48.14]And one day I found myself in a yard behind a bar drawing with Vincenzo.
[60:52.68]Is he brainless?
[60:53.26]10 years go by and I'm still there.
[60:56.51]Brain limiter.
[60:57.03]We need to hold back.
[60:58.51]Be careful.
[60:59.53]We don't need the attention.
[61:02.86]And one day I found myself in a yard behind a bar adjoined with Vincenzo.
[61:07.33]Ten years go by and I'm still there.
[61:09.39]That says a lot about society.
[61:11.46]I got a soup now, and Vinny's an old bastard.
[61:14.99]Fucking society.
[61:15.67]Autumn Tech.
[61:16.35]Tip him.
[61:16.61]What's the green eye?
[61:44.09]There's a green eye right here.
[61:45.19]What's that for?
[61:46.09]Green eye.
[61:46.77]Can you do, like, peel-outs in 1930?
[61:48.13]No, the engine ran on, like, fucking humidity.
[61:52.55]You can't.
[61:52.97]We did it.
[62:17.17]Yes.
[62:18.12]Is the tire fire?
[62:19.62]Wait, one of the tires is on fire?
[62:21.58]Baseball bat him.
[62:22.52]You can't.
[62:22.84]You can't baseball bat your friends.
[62:24.68]That's not going to work in this game.
[62:49.84]Hey, fellas.
[62:50.24]Do you get to play pool?
[62:52.42]Because I'll never play it because I hate pool.
[62:53.92]I think it sucks.
[62:54.46]It's a dumb sport.
[62:57.63]That was really vicious for no reason.
[63:02.95]I'm just kidding.
[63:03.67]I like pool.
[63:05.49]I play it.
[63:06.19]I played it like two weeks ago.
[63:07.53]Come on, guys.
[63:07.93]That's the difference between me and Morello.
[63:19.32]I'm a businessman.
[63:20.65]I do everything with this.
[63:22.65]Everything I make, it's what's good for the business and my boys.
[63:29.05]But Mirella is a hothead.
[63:31.59]And all that anger burns out the brain.
[63:35.21]And when he gets mad, he gets stupid.
[63:38.47]You got nothing like that to worry about with Tommy here.
[63:40.93]He was aces the whole way, boss.
[63:43.34]I'm glad to hear it.
[63:45.46]I got a growing business here.
[63:47.81]We could use a guy like you to help out around the bar.
[63:50.01]I'm scared of you.
[63:50.65]Maybe run some errands.
[63:52.23]Make sure the bills get paid on time.
[63:54.13]You up for that?
[63:56.11]It'd be an honor, sir.
[63:58.23]Good.
[64:00.33]Good.
[64:00.55]What do you think the room would do?
[64:03.25]I've already vouched for you.
[64:05.02]But you need to understand we have a few rules around here, so you listen and listen good.
[64:08.96]First, no cursing on the premises.
[64:11.60]There's a million words out there.
[64:13.50]The man who needs to resort to fuck this and fuck that is just ignorant or lazy.
[64:18.87]Second, we don't deal in the hard stuff.
[64:21.29]I don't want any dope fiends in this neighborhood.
[64:23.59]We'll let Morella poison his own people.
[64:25.21]What would happen if I said, yeah, that's great.
[64:26.99]Can you lean forward a little bit and say that into my chest?
[64:29.65]A little more clear and loud this time.
[64:32.86]And if you cross the line, the rest will come after you.
[64:36.82]You understand?
[64:38.36]Yes, Mr. Salieri.
[64:42.48]Then I'm going to only ask you for one more thing, Tommy.
[64:46.15]I didn't even have a wire on.
[64:48.47]It's a bad prank to pull on the Don.
[64:51.09]A lot of guys out there are bigger and tougher than these two.
[64:54.43]And I don't keep Frank on apparel because he's smart.
[64:57.99]Though he is an artist with the numbers.
[65:01.29]All these guys in this room, they're here because they have the only thing that matters to me.
[65:09.82]The only thing that should matter to any of us.
[65:13.11]Uh, your dog.
[65:14.05]You know what that is, Tommy?
[65:15.29]My dog.
[65:17.43]Your dog.
[65:18.57]His dog.
[65:19.45]Somebody's dog in this room.
[65:22.95]Money.
[65:25.55]That's right.
[65:27.36]Now you stay straight with me, you're going to be living the high life, Tom.
[65:31.74]But you abused my trust.
[65:35.32]Don Celieri, you won't ever need to worry about me.
[65:41.37]Until halfway through the game.
[65:44.31]When you double cross me and then I get angry and we fight and I end up shooting you third person mode.
[65:52.13]Or a grenade.
[65:53.23]Eating one of those is going to work probably in the next two or three hours.
[65:55.47]Is that guy going to ask me for the everlasting gobstopper recipe?
[66:09.98]What was that guy's name in Willy Wonka?
[66:18.00]Squidward or something?
[66:18.92]It was something like that.
[66:20.61]Oh, that's my associate, Squidward.
[66:22.61]What is it?
[66:22.97]What was his name?
[66:25.58]something like slugworth yeah that's slugworth I moved crates and delivered messages the guys busted balls and told stories from the old country mostly we just waited I got to thinking maybe life and ciliary's crew wasn't gonna get me clipped what did I know fight practice oh that was a good move yeah boss is waiting for you thanks
[66:56.95]Can I play too?
[66:57.63]Alright guys, that's enough.
[67:00.16]Settle down.
[67:03.08]Wow, they actually listened.
[67:06.74]Holy shit, the whole place cleared out.
[67:10.24]I have power here.
[67:11.02]Holy shit, alright.
[67:13.25]Anybody in here?
[67:18.81]Alright, I'm going to go back into the room.
[67:27.50]It's a fun game.
[67:29.84]I like that game.
[67:33.63]Aren't we just in here?
[67:34.33]That's collection day, boys.
[67:36.59]So Tommy, you'll drive.
[67:37.85]Paulie and Sam can handle the rest.
[67:39.29]It'll be routine.
[67:41.19]Just a handful of stops today.
[67:43.21]Bill at the motel was a little short last month.
[67:45.87]We'll make sure he pays us the interest he owes.
[67:47.80]No problem, boss.
[67:49.06]Don't lay hands on anyone unless there's no other choice.
[67:52.60]Our clients need to understand that we provide a valuable service.
[67:56.62]They need to look at you and see Santa Michael.
[68:00.02]They need to believe you'll protect them.
[68:02.42]Need to believe.
[68:03.08]Wait, this is illegal?
[68:03.64]Um.
[68:03.72]Yeah.
[68:03.90]Yes, very.
[68:04.72]For a second, I thought he was smoking the cigar backwards.
[68:08.28]Like, holy shit.
[68:09.62]What a Chad move.
[68:27.01]I'd like to tell you some bullshit story about some guy he whacked 20 years ago.
[68:37.77]I kind of like this outfit.
[68:38.61]I feel like I would wear this.
[68:39.63]Nah, I'll lose the tie.
[68:41.01]Lose the tie, lose the hat.
[68:42.37]Zip it down a little bit more.
[68:43.56]Like another four inches.
[68:44.26]Ah, we're losing some motors to him.
[68:57.37]Alright.
[69:00.75]Hey.
[69:01.51]What'd you see?
[69:02.21]Something new?
[69:02.71]Wait, what do you mean?
[69:07.72]You see like this little shitty gun you thought of me?
[69:10.26]You didn't see like a rifle or a bazooka and think of me?
[69:12.88]What's that supposed to mean?
[69:13.50]You think that's funny?
[69:14.52]What, am I funny to you?
[69:16.46]You think that's a joke?
[69:17.68]Fucking little gun?
[69:19.14]You ever carry a rat?
[69:23.20]Shot him at the fair a couple of times.
[69:25.78]Right.
[69:27.15]Funny like a clown?
[69:28.12]Funny?
[69:28.34]Funny how?
[69:29.52]What an incredible scene.
[69:36.48]Oh, shit.
[69:36.78]I just tried to shoot him.
[69:37.52]Do you think he would hear that?
[69:38.56]There's no bullets in here, dude.
[69:41.60]Oh, okay.
[69:42.18]He can see it.
[69:42.80]He can see it.
[69:58.42]How do you reload?
[69:59.14]I open the chamber and away you go.
[70:00.74]Alright, X is reload.
[70:02.22]Alright, last thing.
[70:05.89]Needs to be hidden.
[70:07.45]Stick it in your belt.
[70:11.05]Oh.
[70:11.33]Good to go.
[70:12.49]And when shooting starts, get behind something.
[70:15.53]And don't shoot yourself.
[70:16.81]Thanks, Vincenzo.
[70:17.53]Don't shoot yourself.
[70:18.47]I got it.
[70:18.93]Hey, the Frank and the boss, Vincenzo.
[70:22.58]To you.
[70:24.00]It's Finney.
[70:27.73]Thanks.
[70:28.57]Alright, Ralph.
[70:29.09]I'm ready.
[70:29.81]I got my gun.
[70:31.27]I know how to reload.
[70:32.11]You guys are in the way.
[70:36.27]No, you're not.
[70:38.47]Do a diaper check.
[70:39.25]Alright, Ralph.
[70:44.82]Do we all have guns?
[70:50.02]One year since the crash.
[70:52.36]The worst, yeah, Wall Street crash.
[70:54.20]Right.
[70:58.29]Beyond meat.
[70:58.77]It was really easy.
[70:59.37]Oh shit, that's right.
[71:00.09]These are when the doors were made out of like clay.
[71:02.79]I forgot.
[71:28.46]Opening a car door was as simple as just pulling it a little harder than normal.
[71:31.78]This thing don't even turn on, man!
[71:38.82]This is a lemon!
[71:51.07]First we got Al.
[71:52.27]He runs a bakery on Longman Street.
[71:54.48]You know it?
[71:55.14]Yeah, I know it.
[71:56.06]Al's late again?
[71:57.52]Seems so.
[71:58.86]That's too bad.
[72:01.42]What happened to him?
[72:03.42]What happened to him?
[72:04.88]Is he okay?
[72:05.84]Holy shit.
[72:08.95]Drive safe, Tom.
[72:10.75]Polly's real delicate.
[72:14.85]He's alive still.
[72:18.81]Stop it.
[72:19.42]He's alright.
[72:20.08]He's fine.
[72:23.72]Drive to the collection.
[72:26.02]Oh, now that's what we're talking about.
[72:30.64]I can't snap my fingers and drive the car.
[72:36.31]By the way, can I tell you about my favorite game, Billiards?
[72:40.23]It's one of the best.
[72:41.87]I like to go to the bar and play a round or two with the friends.
[72:57.01]Is he drunk?
[72:59.23]At what?
[73:00.01]Are you asking if I'm drunk at 1.15 in the afternoon on a Tuesday?
[73:06.47]Yes.
[73:07.83]Yes.
[73:19.42]Turn up the volume.
[73:22.20]Set a reasonable volume.
[73:25.32]Alright, we have to collect money.
[73:26.26]So don't hurt them, right?
[73:27.28]Just... Just drive up here and be like, give me the money.
[73:35.02]And aim the gun at them and don't shoot.
[73:37.77]Got it.
[73:37.99]Easy.
[73:38.87]Okay, this is it.
[73:44.43]Watch what we do today, Tom.
[73:46.35]When it goes smooth, it's a breeze.
[73:48.37]When they put up a fight, sometimes you gotta think on your feet.
[73:52.02]Sure.
[73:52.38]Just follow my lead.
[73:57.39]Did you guys hear Otto sneeze?
[74:01.83]He just went... Okay.
[74:05.89]Done.
[74:06.01]We're good.
[74:10.20]How's the money?
[74:11.10]I mean, how's the restaurant?
[74:20.68]This letter is a notification that you are in default of your obligation to make payments on your agreed loan.
[74:25.48]This amount has been overdue since July 15, 1930.
[74:28.12]You've ignored requests to pay this debt.
[74:30.42]Unless the full amount is received, within two weeks I will have no choice but to instruct this bank to begin the foreclosure process of your home and business.
[74:37.05]That's us.
[74:37.45]Just like her grandma.
[74:38.83]That's good to hear, Al.
[74:43.25]Then we have to do, like, protection.
[74:47.77]We have to rough the place up.
[74:49.19]Should I just eat a bunch of bread?
[74:50.07]Stop picking up loaves and taking bites.
[74:51.51]Alright, let's give him another month.
[75:10.08]I think he deserves another month.
[75:16.03]Double or nothing.
[75:17.55]If he doesn't have the money in three months, then we come back and we, I don't know, we like take his sneakers and we sell them.
[75:30.40]Uh-oh.
[75:30.86]There's drugs back here.
[75:35.08]I don't feel bad anymore.
[75:39.96]Dude, he's got a Sam Trapini card?
[75:41.48]This is worth like five grand.
[75:45.50]What's she saying?
[75:49.20]Table, brown envelope.
[75:57.26]That's not... I probably wouldn't be doing that if I were you.
[76:05.38]Lady, you're lucky that this is a fucking World of Warcraft sanctuary.
[76:10.27]Otherwise, that chair is flying across the room.
[76:12.60]Daily WoW reference, yeah, that's the one.
[76:18.82]That old lady has more power than the dawn.
[76:21.90]Somebody's gonna fight back.
[76:39.84]And then I'm gonna have to take out the bat.
[76:41.93]And start swinging, right?
[76:43.05]That's how this is gonna work.
[76:48.79]No, don't.
[76:49.49]What's the point of that?
[76:50.40]That doesn't do anything for me.
[77:00.38]That was just gonna be violence.
[77:02.43]Just for violence.
[77:03.25]Like, no.
[77:03.77]I'm not doing that.
[77:04.45]We're just gonna drive.
[77:05.23]Pop.
[77:05.37]Can I go?
[77:28.15]I don't know the rules of the road.
[77:29.34]I don't know the right-of-way tiers.
[77:32.60]Slow down.
[77:33.30]I'm going over the speed limit.
[77:43.81]People just go.
[77:44.73]It's not even four-way stop signs.
[77:47.73]It's just drive across four lanes.
[77:50.89]This is bad.
[77:59.73]Welcome to the 1920s, yeah.
[78:07.35]I'm not going over the speed limit, right?
[78:11.71]Don't break any laws.
[78:12.31]There's a cop right here.
[78:14.11]That guy's a cop.
[78:17.83]No.
[78:18.69]That car is a cop.
[78:20.78]Something over there is a cop.
[78:28.53]Go ahead.
[78:28.89]Go, go, go.
[78:29.43]Go ahead.
[78:29.67]Go.
[78:29.95]Get ahead.
[78:30.19]Head.
[78:31.67]Move.
[78:36.07]There's a guy in the way.
[78:37.01]If there's a pedestrian in a crosswalk and you're waiting for the pedestrian and you get beeped at, that person deserves a middle finger.
[78:57.07]I was backing out of a spot.
[78:59.31]Okay, so this is a story that I think about sometimes.
[79:03.66]I was backing out of a spot in a parking lot one time.
[79:08.10]And this lady was parked perpendicular, like right behind me.
[79:12.26]She was stopped.
[79:13.08]She wasn't parked, but she was pulled up in the parking lot.
[79:14.92]I think she was waiting for somebody or something.
[79:16.66]But she was right in the way of where I was trying to back up.
[79:19.33]She was right just blocking me.
[79:21.63]And she didn't move.
[79:23.52]This lady did not move.
[79:24.66]It was like I had to finagle so much around her car.
[79:28.11]And she kept on like closing her door and she's like, no, back up, back up.
[79:31.15]Yeah, you're good, you're good.
[79:32.29]And I'm just like, okay, what the fuck?
[79:33.57]Am I good?
[79:34.31]I'm out.
[79:35.15]And right at the very end, I didn't say anything.
[79:36.77]Right at the very end when I finally, after like a full minute of like doing an eight point turn to get around this lady, I put my thumb out the window and gave up like a thumbs up real quick.
[79:46.39]And I think she thought I gave her the finger.
[79:47.71]I was like, yup, yup, I'm good.
[79:50.13]But I think she saw the finger and was just like, fuck you.
[79:58.40]But it was a thumbs up.
[79:59.86]It was like, I'm good, yeah.
[80:00.55]Did we get out of the car?
[80:02.49]That was a sign... That happened in Seinfeld.
[80:04.41]Wait, that happened in Seinfeld?
[80:18.06]I'm not lying.
[80:19.14]I didn't watch an episode of Seinfeld and then pulled it out of my memory.
[80:22.72]I gave the thumbs up to somebody.
[80:26.24]That's not a fake story.
[80:27.58]I swear to God, that happened.
[80:34.59]Try before the cop show, Tom.
[80:36.15]It happened in Seinfeld.
[80:39.23]Dude, this dude just watched an episode of Seinfeld and then, like, somehow made it a part of his life.
[80:46.26]No, this happened, like, three weeks ago.
[80:48.82]It was not that long ago.
[80:50.00]Once he's back on his feet.
[80:56.24]Holy shit, that guy just monster trucked that dude.
[80:58.50]Whoa.
[80:58.78]I don't know.
[81:10.83]Stealing jokes.
[81:11.19]Is it stealing jokes if it happened to you in real life?
[81:13.35]I swear to God.
[81:14.01]Why did I think that was a good idea?
[81:15.43]No working after.
[81:37.53]Are we okay?
[81:39.41]I thought it was grass.
[81:43.84]I thought it was grass.
[81:44.66]I just got like loony tuned.
[81:47.60]You hid.
[81:49.48]You knew I was going to try to cut through the grass.
[81:51.88]And you put a bunch of rocks in them.
[81:53.92]Sorry, huh?
[81:54.97]Well, I'd say sorry if I couldn't see the bullshit smile you're trying to hide.
[81:59.39]This is beautiful.
[82:00.73]This is a beautiful countryside.
[82:02.95]Where are we supposed to be?
[82:04.99]I want to visit this place.
[82:25.37]New York.
[82:26.15]New York City!
[82:26.90]Hey.
[82:27.08]Card games.
[82:45.39]Alright, I gotta ask you guys a really important question.
[82:47.86]This is the definitive moment of the stream.
[82:50.02]Is it Mafia or Mafia?
[82:50.98]I hear a lot of people say Mafia.
[82:52.76]I'm gonna be playing Mafia.
[82:53.98]I wanna play Mafia.
[82:55.24]Oh, shit.
[82:55.58]What am I talking about?
[82:56.32]People say Mafia.
[82:57.08]Mafia.
[83:12.51]Not Mafia.
[83:13.03]No one does that.
[83:13.75]Yes, they do.
[83:14.05]Yes, they do.
[83:14.63]Yes, they do.
[83:32.90]I wouldn't be saying it if it wasn't true.
[83:34.38]Ahhhh!
[83:34.64]Oh!
[83:34.72]Seinfeld.
[83:34.92]Making up fake pronunciations.
[84:02.98]I've heard people say Mafia.
[84:06.16]Mafia.
[84:06.84]Mafia.
[84:07.78]People say Mario.
[84:09.66]Super Mario.
[84:10.58]So it's not above... What?
[84:12.14]This is not even right.
[84:22.21]People say Super Mario.
[84:24.31]Mostly they're over the age of 50.
[84:26.65]Don't tell me that your parents did not call him Super Mario.
[84:31.57]Yes, they did.
[84:37.78]Those people are wrong.
[84:39.14]That doesn't mean they don't happen!
[84:40.32]Cool, man.
[84:57.70]The name Mario existed before that game.
[85:02.50]So?
[85:05.30]Wait, I'm not arguing the origins of the name Mario.
[85:09.58]I just said some people pronounce it Mario.
[85:20.97]Remember, you're like five years younger than my dad.
[85:22.83]Omega low.
[85:24.07]No, I'm not.
[85:25.71]Dad's like 39?
[85:26.27]How old are you?
[85:34.47]Are you eight?
[85:38.36]What are you doing here?
[85:39.28]This is an illegal stream for you to be on.
[85:41.00]Look, it's... Where's the rock?
[85:42.58]There's no rock in there.
[85:44.14]I was hoping for an explosion.
[85:45.92]I'll be honest.
[85:46.68]Okay, let me be... I'll come clean here.
[86:05.88]I was hoping it was a gas tank.
[86:07.61]Alright, I was going for it.
[86:30.38]Tommy, I took one.
[86:31.64]Jesus Christ, Polly.
[86:33.30]Tell Salieri from here on out this place is ours.
[86:36.06]Capisce?
[86:37.06]And don't come back, or you'll end up in worse shape than your friends.
[86:41.91]Polly, go do your thing.
[86:43.37]Trying to get information out of him?
[86:45.31]I gotta get you to a doctor.
[86:47.97]I can wait.

[87:17.00]Okay.
[87:17.88]There would be no suspicion here.
[87:19.04]You would think there was an animal outside.
[87:21.32]Like a raccoon.
[87:33.25]Let my friend go!
[87:46.96]What's in here?
[87:48.14]A bed.

[96:50.74]What?
[97:02.65]Open door.
[97:03.33]They're all in there.
[97:04.63]They're all just a clown cart into the room.

[100:16.09]Somebody shot me.
[100:16.99]What happened?

[102:41.51]What'd they do?
[102:44.50]Somebody leaning out of the car trying to shoot at me?
[102:48.32]This person's just in the fucking way.

[104:13.33]I'm just, I can't even aim this.
[104:15.31]It's just, I guess I'm shooting at the back of their car.
[104:23.32]Why for a speed boost?
[104:28.57]Spam it.

[105:55.95]I may as well just put my head underwater and scream.
[106:06.55]Okay, this is the one right here.
[106:07.83]This is the one.
[106:15.76]Oh, fucking.
[106:16.50]I can't.
[106:16.92]I hope you guys forget about the chubby bunny thing.
[106:18.46]I really do.
[106:36.00]Am I even hitting him?
[106:45.58]I'm hitting him, I guess.
[107:02.10]No one hit a fucking tree.
[107:03.08]For the love of God.
[107:17.19]Alright, I got it.
[107:17.79]I got it.
[107:17.97]This is the one.

[107:18.63]This is the run.
[107:28.40]Watch out for the rocks.
[107:47.36]Come on, dude.
[107:47.92]Really?
[107:51.44]Out.
[107:52.26]Do not turn into me.
[107:59.15]Is he dead?
[108:01.95]Search the car.
[108:02.65]Get out.
[108:07.27]That was what I saw at a cost.
[108:09.35]What it meant to be on the inside.
[108:12.53]I should have took off there and then.
[108:17.40]30 years in this chair, that's how you show up, everybody, how you do it.
[108:20.78]That was a really bad victory fucking exclamation.
[108:23.12]I don't know what the hell I was trying to say.
[108:28.86]Chapter complete.
[108:30.70]Intermezzo.
[108:33.60]So that's how a regular palooka goes from cabbie to mob enforcer overnight, is it?
[108:38.28]Just dumb luck?
[108:40.61]Didn't feel that way at the time.
[108:43.11]Me parking on that particular street.
[108:45.13]30 years just to do a chubby bunny stream.
[108:47.98]That's gonna be so embarrassing.
[108:51.10]I don't know, like someone was watching out for us.
[108:55.46]Whatever helps you sleep at night, pal, but it's a lucky break all the same.
[108:59.42]I mean, one day you're busting your back doing an honest day's work in a city that's been trying to scrape you off its heels.
[109:04.66]Thanks, you boy, for the 10 community subs.
[109:07.22]Raglan, thank you.
[109:11.03]10 subs dropped right now?
[109:12.19]Yeah, it wasn't like that.
[109:13.87]Back then, Salieri didn't have the run of the city.
[109:16.51]Remember that can actually kill you.
[109:17.83]What?
[109:18.03]I can die from Chubby Bunny?
[109:45.05]Kids have died doing Chubby Bunny before.
[109:49.03]Wait, I hear it.
[109:50.21]Joey was just driving to the gym one morning.
[109:53.79]Wait, I'll be very careful.
[109:55.91]I'll dunk him in water first.
[109:58.71]God damn it.
[110:01.88]Moron.
[110:03.02]The gym with your goddamn eyes closed.
[110:06.14]Look at this.
[110:09.28]No, I'm not going to eat them.
[110:10.32]Jesus, Barry.
[110:11.38]Joseph Tommarolo.
[110:13.70]I didn't know it was you.
[110:16.21]I'm going to turn the cam off and I'm going to do a big smear puke out of my mouth.
[110:21.59]Yeah.
[110:22.63]Into like a trash can.
[110:23.63]I'm sorry.
[110:24.13]I was driving real slow.
[110:28.15]You're saying this is my fault?
[110:29.65]No, no, no, no, no, sir.
[110:31.39]I just, I just, I ain't never been in no accident.
[110:35.71]Well, repairs are going to be expensive.
[110:41.70]What?
[110:42.16]And that's how you went to jail for the rest of your life.
[110:44.89]Hey.
[111:11.61]There's a Pizza Hut warm-up box thing when they deliver the pizza.
[111:15.21]I wasn't paying attention.
[111:16.05]I could have been funnier.
[111:17.07]Yeah.
[111:39.59]I love when people get so pissed off.
[111:42.09]It's just like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[111:45.59]It gives me energy!
[111:46.43]What is a chubby bunny?
[111:47.93]I ain't gonna lie.
[112:06.55]You get marshmallows and you put them in your cheeks.
[112:08.99]You say chubby bunny after you put one in.
[112:13.37]I'm not going to do that many.
[112:14.43]I'm not going to do a dangerous amount of marshmallows.
[112:16.41]Guys, I'm not going to put enough marshmallows to kill me in my mouth.
[112:18.88]I'm just going to do enough for it to be accurate.
[112:28.64]Tommy.
[112:30.03]Thanks for getting down here so quickly.
[112:31.57]Yeah, sure thing, boss.
[112:32.91]What do you need?
[112:33.77]You know, there's a race coming up.
[112:35.39]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[112:36.12]Paulie and Sam have some money on the local.
[112:38.80]Mikey Dunn.
[112:39.88]That's the guy.
[112:40.70]He's a good kid, but a bit of a scrapper.
[112:42.60]Not too smart with his money.
[112:43.66]A few years ago, Mikey comes to me asking for a loan.
[112:46.71]He wants to get new tires so he can keep racing junkers out at the quarry.
[112:51.36]I like fast cars.
[112:52.28]I figure it'll be a bit of a hobby.
[112:54.18]Turns out, Mikey's a great investment.
[112:57.42]The kid can't lose a race if he walks the track.
[113:00.65]He graduates from the junkers to gal jobs, and I start placing a few bets on him here and there.
[113:05.23]Next thing I know, I've made all my money back and more.
[113:08.53]Hey, Sam says he's the guy to beat.
[113:10.45]He was.
[113:11.92]We ran all the competition out of town.
[113:14.08]Here it comes.
[113:14.94]Here it comes.
[113:15.52]Oh fuck.
[113:15.78]Five hour mission.
[113:16.52]Okay.
[113:16.76]Fodd friends skip ten hours.
[113:42.92]You want something to happen to the driver?
[113:44.60]Can't find him.
[113:45.24]Well, you're giving me a lot of power here to want to beat this really, really quickly and really skillful.
[113:50.06]None of our wagers will stand.
[113:52.66]Everyone will cry foul, say the race is fixed.
[113:56.61]What about his car?
[113:58.29]That's the ticket, Tommy.
[114:00.73]Ralph knows a guard at the track.
[114:02.57]You go down there tonight, you boost the European's car, bring it to one of our mechanics, I'll make a few adjustments, you bring the car back.
[114:09.23]Should be no problem, boss.
[114:15.27]Okay.
[114:16.27]Talk to Ralph.
[114:16.87]Odd viewers, skip to 2 hours and 36 minutes and 14 seconds for the next mission.
[114:24.61]That's very specific.
[114:42.63]So that's a five, a six.
[114:46.13]Hey, T-T-Tommy.
[114:47.53]Big day coming up, right?
[114:49.65]Hey, no.
[114:50.39]Time traveler.
[114:51.21]Kind of hard to miss.
[114:52.39]I'm still here.
[114:52.89]He isn't going to let Morello break his winning streak, huh?
[114:55.25]No, no, sir.
[114:56.33]Got to send him a message.
[114:58.15]So, tonight, we will borrow his guy's motor from the track.
[115:02.27]My friend Bobby is a guard.
[115:03.95]For a little dough, he'll show you where it is.
[115:06.14]Then look someplace else while you t-t-t-turn your key.
[115:08.98]I like Bobby already.
[115:11.18]Why are you saying the Travis Scott burger?
[115:13.44]This mission made me cry growing up.
[115:41.95]Oh, because you just saw the ad.
[115:44.95]Oh, right, right, right.
[115:46.71]Everyone saying that just saw the ad.
[115:51.43]Right, right.
[115:51.89]I forgot.
[115:55.86]Oh, shit.
[115:57.12]Alright.
[115:58.36]What do I got?
[115:58.94]Taxi 6, the V8.
[116:02.28]I want the V8, man.
[116:03.00]Are you kidding me?
[116:03.62]This thing's sick.
[116:08.11]And add vehicles to the garage by driving them.
[116:11.18]Eat with the guard at the racetrack.
[116:12.18]Alright, this is a fast car.
[116:12.94]This is the last mission everybody plays before dropping the game.
[116:24.80]Okay.
[116:25.46]This is the second mission in the whole game.
[116:33.08]Realistically speaking.
[116:35.28]You pass on the left in the 30s.
[116:47.85]I want a motorcycle so bad.
[116:49.17]I want I'm gonna do no I'm gonna do motorcycle.
[116:50.97]No, I'm not it's gone already nevermind You guys are really talking up this mission
[117:09.69]Dude, I gotta prepare for this then.
[117:28.47]A long way away, isn't it?
[117:29.49]Alright, here we go.
[117:43.11]What, I have to soup this thing up?
[117:45.97]30 years of gaming about to come to an end.
[117:47.65]Oh man.
[117:47.91]Big brain cigarettes?
[118:19.80]All right.
[118:20.12]Here we are.
[118:20.46]Okay.
[118:22.83]This is it.
[118:23.43]This is it.
[118:23.87]All right.
[118:30.43]I'm just stretching.
[118:38.13]Ooh.
[118:39.83]There she is.
[118:42.29]Best in class.
[118:43.85]It's a shame you got a record.
[118:45.83]Try to keep it in one piece and... It's time.
[118:48.03]Is that what it is?
[118:48.67]It's time.
[118:49.98]Okay, let's go.
[119:20.85]We're good?
[119:22.01]Just keep the car in one piece, get back in two minutes.
[119:23.89]Holy shit, this thing is fast!
[119:42.51]It's alright, I got one guy looking at me.
[119:48.97]We're good.
[119:49.39]So far, so good.
[119:50.43]I'm at 50% damage.
[119:51.13]Oh!
[119:51.19]Get this thing out of the way.
[119:52.71]What the fuck are you doing?
[120:18.72]I got a full minute.
[120:20.28]We're going to take a shortcut.
[120:22.77]Shit.
[120:30.55]Shortcut to the checkpoint is what I meant.
[120:39.32]Restart.
[120:39.72]Already don't like it.
[120:41.80]Bad start.
[120:42.30]Bad start.
[120:43.14]Really bad start.
[120:43.74]Just restart.
[120:47.52]Or not.
[120:47.78]Let's see.
[120:51.29]Alright, the handling is insane, so just slow down.
[120:53.51]How do I re- just restart from checkpoint.
[121:21.30]Just punch yourself in the face?
[121:23.21]Alright, easy.
[121:26.83]Don't go crazy.
[121:27.53]You probably don't have to go that fast.
[121:30.57]It's just addicting to go fast in this game.
[121:33.37]Okay, slow down.
[121:34.03]Big turn.
[121:41.12]That was stupid.
[121:48.26]I touched the bumper.
[121:49.34]Okay, so it bounced me across the whole game.
[121:58.38]I just gotta get good car spawns and I'll be fine.
[122:00.28]Pass this guy on the right and then lean to the left a little.
[122:08.31]The right, I mean.
[122:11.61]Sidewalk drive if you can.
[122:15.21]Okay, we're fine.
[122:27.88]Right down the middle.
[122:31.52]Right down the middle.
[122:33.96]Right.
[122:34.94]Low down.
[122:39.11]Who's in control?
[122:51.83]Okay.
[122:52.07]I got one minute.
[123:14.91]It's right there.
[123:15.43]It's right there.
[123:15.95]I got 39 seconds hardest mission in the game.
[123:18.11]You kidding me?
[123:18.63]I'm done.
[123:29.87]It's so hard.
[123:30.71]Yeah, I mean, it was tricky.
[123:39.42]Oh, that's not a garage door that opens.
[123:41.24]Oh, shit.
[123:46.30]I'm good.
[123:49.28]Hey, hey, you want a health stick?
[123:50.96]Yeah, sure, I'll take a health stick.
[124:22.00]Okay, now what?
[124:22.78]Thanks, Lucas.
[124:24.58]I gotta get back before anyone catches on.
[124:26.56]If this turns on with ten seconds left, I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[124:30.47]Hey, tell Mr. Salieri I'm always available for this kind of work.
[124:36.77]I do stuff for a lot of people, but I always know where I stand with you guys.
[124:42.39]Our cars, getaways, anything for the right price.
[124:47.14]Let's just hope Salieri's guy wins tomorrow.
[124:51.79]It's gonna misbehave.
[125:03.12]Two minutes.
[125:05.80]Okay, I got two minutes.
[125:09.16]It's gonna misbehave.
[125:11.03]Is that what the engine indicator thing on top is supposed to mean?
[125:14.51]Okay, so it can't get that hot.
[125:16.77]Don't hold the minigun down for that long.
[125:29.16]This is an easy straightaway.
[125:32.74]Oh, and shit just knocks you around too.
[125:35.16]It bounces you around.
[125:36.26]It's alright.
[125:36.83]This is not as bad as I thought it was gonna be.
[125:40.07]Pull it down.
[125:41.07]Punch it.
[125:51.06]The right and then a right.
[125:51.74]Move!
[126:01.80]Alright.
[126:02.74]Wrong side of the road.
[126:03.55]That's where I shine the most.
[126:24.67]I'm almost there.
[126:25.11]I'm almost there.
[126:25.51]Just get out of the way.
[126:40.16]32 seconds.
[126:40.60]I got it.
[126:40.92]Oof.
[126:44.58]Out of the way.
[126:46.68]Right here.
[126:47.20]25 seconds.
[126:49.34]Shortcut?
[126:49.94]Should I do a shortcut?
[126:50.70]Or just do it?
[126:51.12]12 seconds.
[126:59.72]10 seconds.
[127:01.86]8 seconds.
[127:02.18]5. 4.
[127:16.70]Okay.
[127:19.00]I thought I could go through the fence somehow.
[127:25.68]Alright, here we go.
[127:31.15]Don't let up.
[127:31.77]I'm gonna get there.
[127:32.51]Here we go.
[127:32.99]You know, I should go the other way.
[127:37.77]You idiot.
[127:39.38]Fucking idiot.
[127:40.02]That's not even my fault.
[127:40.90]Alright, what happens if the thing goes all the way up?
[127:51.93]Does it explode?
[127:53.31]As long as I keep it under that bar, I'm fine.
[128:08.87]Damage doesn't make it go higher.
[128:10.67]I'm okay.
[128:15.77]That was a pretty clean transition out of that spot.
[128:17.35]That's a hard spot.
[128:18.05]That's a hard turn.
[128:24.45]Wrong side of the road.
[128:29.16]Good.
[128:29.76]Oh my god!
[128:30.56]I almost just hit the side!
[128:32.06]It's alright.
[128:32.88]Shh.
[128:48.66]Alright, watch out, watch out.
[128:49.48]That Rice-A-Roni truck.
[128:51.80]You dick!
[128:52.58]I kno- Okay, that's the part that's gonna be a problem.
[129:08.71]I think I still got it.
[129:09.35]Come on, eat a second.
[129:24.20]That was close.
[129:25.86]I filled it all the way up.
[129:27.43]That was really close.
[129:28.69]That would have been a 500-yard shot if a golf game was in this.
[129:39.21]Oh, dude.
[129:39.75]This is impossible.
[129:40.61]This mission is not even completable.
[129:44.94]Did I win?
[130:02.28]Oh, wow.
[130:03.84]You just get... Alright.
[130:05.00]That's not bad.
[130:11.97]Alright.
[130:12.99]That wasn't that bad.
[130:16.61]Oh, wow.
[130:16.85]We just got a monster raid from Kit Boga.
[130:28.49]What's going on, guys?
[130:29.75]Welcome to the stream.
[130:30.85]Thank you, Kitpoga, for the raid.
[130:32.25]That's a monster raid.
[130:36.48]Hope you had a good stream, dude.
[130:37.82]We're playing Mafia Remastered.
[130:41.52]Gonna be fun.
[130:42.60]Some of the most fun I've had in a long time was on Kit's stream.
[130:45.66]It's a pleasure to have you here.
[130:47.06]Welcome.
[130:59.44]This crazy bastard, he wants us out of the bathroom to start pissing all over the joint.
[131:04.14]Really?
[131:04.64]Is the actual hard part?
[131:07.12]Sometimes you just gotta make them think you're crazy.
[131:09.12]Yeah, pizza buddy raid, that's right.
[131:10.84]You got the moments.
[131:12.56]Sure, Frank.
[131:14.40]Actual hard part?
[131:17.29]You guys, you can't... Boy, you cried wolf.
[131:19.87]First, it was the first part.
[131:22.27]Ah, he's not gonna do it.
[131:23.01]Second part, ah, it's impossible.
[131:24.07]Third part, it's impossible.
[131:25.25]Send him to the hospital.
[131:27.94]Stream chat that cried wolf, I think.
[131:30.36]And you are our best wheelman.
[131:32.02]Otherwise, I'd be talking to someone else.
[131:50.01]Doesn't know.
[131:51.26]Sing the raid song.
[131:52.38]I don't have a raid song.
[131:55.00]I have a follower song.
[131:55.84]You know how it goes.
[131:56.80]Fill the lyrics in.
[131:57.84]You know how they go.
[132:23.44]Alright, so I have to just win the race.
[132:25.16]Do I have to kill somebody in the race or what?
[132:39.43]Just win.
[132:40.25]Okay.
[132:41.91]Alright, if I hold it on the buzzer, do I get a boost like in Mario Kart?
[132:49.06]Something's wrong with the car.
[132:54.09]Just win the race.
[133:03.01]I took that guy out.
[133:04.46]That guy's not gonna race anymore.
[133:05.76]That was crazy.
[133:10.50]Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[133:13.82]I got three laps to get to first place.
[133:20.29]Holy shit.
[133:23.91]Oh, it's too fast.
[133:25.43]Don't go that fast.
[133:34.15]It's funny now, but yeah, I'm probably going to be very, very agitated in about 10 minutes.
[133:40.58]We're laughing now.
[133:41.40]Oh, he hit the guy.
[133:42.54]That funny moment is going to be a rage inducing moment in about 15 minutes.
[133:51.12]Just restart.
[133:52.06]I've got this three laps.
[133:55.50]Look, I'm closing in.
[133:56.20]I'm closing in.
[133:56.60]I'm closing in.
[134:10.64]Right?
[134:11.02]That's, yeah, on my neck.
[134:12.56]That would be very painful.
[134:13.58]That would be horrible.
[134:21.34]Nothing matters until the last 10 seconds of the race, guys.
[134:24.08]Don't you know?
[134:26.37]I could be two miles away in last place.
[134:30.11]As long as I just come in first, who cares?
[134:32.43]I mean, I'm very far away right now.
[134:44.21]I'm going to get lapped.
[134:47.08]Are the other drivers still on the course?
[134:48.50]Garcia, Lewis, and Jackson are pushing ahead toward the front of the field.
[135:02.10]Guys, all I have to do is get a blue shell.
[135:04.52]They give all the fucking losers back in 10th place blue shells.
[135:08.54]I'll be fine.
[135:16.80]Just restart?
[135:17.70]Fine.
[135:26.33]I need to get the cannon.
[135:27.25]Yeah, the bullet bill where you just teleport through everybody.
[135:40.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah, skip.
[135:47.50]One, two, three.
[135:49.88]All right, just do it like every other racing game like this.
[135:57.94]Just stay behind everybody and wait till there's a major crash and then just slowly go 10 miles per hour by everybody.
[136:14.37]Hey, we're fine.
[136:14.87]I'm still here.
[136:16.99]Always pass on the inside.
[136:18.03]Hey, I want to stay in like 5th to 10th place until the last 10 seconds.
[136:30.10]I already have the strategy.
[136:31.20]I already know what to do.
[136:31.80]That guy's dead.
[136:34.50]Alright, we gotta crash.
[136:35.40]We gotta crash.
[136:37.76]You see?
[136:38.26]Tenth place.
[136:41.46]This is exactly where I want to be.
[136:50.31]Good.
[136:55.13]I don't want to be in first place.
[136:58.37]Son of a bitch!
[137:08.24]That turn sucks.
[137:16.25]It's not about going fast.
[137:18.09]At all.
[137:18.35]He's throwing?
[137:21.33]Wow, I'm in ninth place.
[137:22.63]I'm like halfway there.
[137:23.51]Alright, now punch it.
[137:31.99]And then there's a huge, that big turn here.
[137:33.75]Okay, here we go.
[137:34.17]We're going to lose two more people in front of us.
[137:38.54]Oh my god, what do I do?
[137:40.75]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[137:42.53]What?!
[137:48.63]My fucking god, this is horrible.
[137:59.05]Restart?
[137:59.59]Not yet.
[138:04.19]Once I can't see the car in front of me, I'll restart.
[138:13.58]Does the fucking wheel even work?
[138:16.03]I'm turning the car and I'm just going straight.
[138:43.39]Yeah, it's a restart.
[138:44.11]It has to be.
[138:46.71]Holy shit, this is ridiculous.
[138:48.01]Okay, here we go.
[138:52.54]New plan.
[138:53.86]New plan is to cause a horrible, awful accident.
[138:57.94]Just stuff myself into first place and just try to blow up like 10 of these cars.
[139:03.14]Stay right here.
[139:03.78]I'm going to just drive into the crowd.
[139:06.42]Like this group here.
[139:13.33]Okay, well it all did was take me out All right, I'm gonna slow down That's unethical well, I'm just trying to win I
[139:38.83]Okay, I'm going to try.
[139:39.73]I'm going to do very, very slow.
[139:40.95]I have to drift and shit.
[139:49.94]Why do I have to start all the way back here?
[139:51.34]That's so unfair.
[139:52.06]I'm going to try some drifting.
[140:06.77]Come on, stay with it.
[140:08.85]These people are stopping in front of me.
[140:10.80]They're actually holding their brakes down.
[140:28.15]Dicks!
[140:33.39]Okay.
[140:33.85]Alright.
[140:34.15]I'm going to be in 12th.
[140:37.55]Holy shit.
[140:38.07]We dodged that one.
[140:51.02]Oh, most lost control.
[141:03.82]Just go with the crash.
[141:04.66]Go with the crash.
[141:05.10]Go with the crash.
[141:24.37]I'm not in last place, I'm in 14th.
[141:36.49]Two people are dead.
[141:37.25]So?
[141:53.47]How the fuck do you take this turn with... Use the brakes.
[142:11.04]You can't use the gun.
[142:12.48]I don't have a gun.
[142:13.42]What are you talking about?
[142:15.56]I'm going to go left side.
[142:24.86]We're gonna go left side.
[142:26.21]We're gonna try to pass everybody on the left.
[142:32.99]I'm gonna try to stay somewhere around 80.
[142:40.47]Why is my car covered in fucking cooking oil?
[142:42.43]Like, I don't... Why can I... I don't understand.
[142:44.59]What the fuck?
[142:48.79]I was going slow.
[142:49.71]The thing just spun out.
[143:06.59]Bad traction.
[143:07.67]Well, they have bad traction too.
[143:08.89]It's not fair.
[143:09.35]Alright.
[143:16.94]Let's try this again.
[143:17.52]I was in like 9th or 8th place.
[143:19.12]We're going to improve here.
[143:21.20]This big turn is stupid.
[143:22.46]And it gets rid of all the newbie players.
[143:39.28]Oh my god.
[143:49.09]Slow down, Omega Lull.
[143:51.23]How fast do you think I was going right there?
[143:52.93]I was going like 25 miles per hour.
[143:54.51]We warned you.
[144:08.02]So is this one of those scenarios where this game, when it was returned to Blockbuster, was... You know when you would buy a game or rent a game at Blockbuster, it would have like a save file on it?
[144:16.94]Was it just always on this save file?
[144:19.85]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[144:20.79]It's alright, it's alright, it's alright!
[144:21.63]I got it, I got it, I got it!
[144:34.32]See ya, son of a bitch!
[144:47.94]Lightning McQueen?
[144:48.76]What?
[144:57.74]We're gonna do the same thing as that guy!
[145:05.86]Okay, hold on.
[145:06.72]Let me see the mini-map.
[145:07.62]Can I see anybody yet?
[145:16.39]Holy shit, this is horrible.
[145:20.21]So this is what you guys were talking about.
[145:31.54]Now he gets it.
[145:35.02]Three laps, too?
[145:36.28]What were they?
[145:37.08]Why?
[145:37.52]Why not just one?
[145:39.56]Why do we have to do three of these?
[145:40.72]Don't hold the gas down.
[145:44.14]I'm not.
[145:44.70]I'm being gentle.
[146:05.12]Okay, we're good, kind of.
[146:06.51]I guess, kind of.
[146:09.73]That was very gentle, but I'm in last place.
[146:20.97]Look, as long as I can see everybody, I don't even care.
[146:27.97]Alright, this guy is erratically driving.
[146:29.57]I'm going a little too fast, but sorry.
[146:37.40]I'm just going to gain some ground.
[146:38.22]I'm going to slow down right here.
[146:39.22]Just coast.
[146:39.70]Coast, coast, coast, coast, coast.
[146:45.24]Come on.
[146:45.62]You guys are filling up the road.
[146:46.70]Pass on the left.
[146:49.69]Okay, slow.
[146:50.11]Good?
[146:50.23]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[146:54.59]Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
[146:55.35]Get out of my way.
[146:57.24]He's connected to me.
[146:58.08]He's connected to me.
[146:58.88]You fucking connected to me.
[146:59.88]That guy latched tires onto me and told me... He hooked my tire with his tire.
[147:22.66]That was better than the last attempt though.
[147:24.00]That was better than the last time.
[147:29.13]Got stream sniped.
[147:31.67]Alright.
[147:40.50]Here comes the famous difficult turn where every single AI can do it except for the one guy in the back who's the computer, non-computer player.
[147:51.19]Nobody else has any trouble with that at all, except for the one guy actually playing the fucking video game.
[147:57.07]Famous!
[147:57.48]Alright.
[148:13.43]Stay on the left side here.
[148:14.91]Don't hook onto somebody.
[148:19.31]We're okay.
[148:20.33]Alright.
[148:21.21]I'm doing way better than I was the last few times.
[148:24.80]That's certain.
[148:26.66]Lowdown.
[148:28.34]Get off of me.
[148:33.06]Same guy.
[148:33.49]Okay.
[148:43.89]That's always been the wall.
[148:50.11]Still not in a bad spot.
[148:51.07]Let's do this turn good.
[149:07.56]Really?
[149:13.02]Why are you guys all going so fast?
[149:18.93]I got into the famous turn again.
[149:20.15]Alright, this is lap two.
[149:20.89]I didn't crash yet, so that's good.
[149:25.15]Dude, what the fuck is this mission?
[149:34.51]What the hell?
[149:43.17]Lower the difficulty?
[149:44.27]How would that change the driving?
[149:55.26]It's worse AI?
[149:57.88]It actually is worse AI?
[150:00.40]Classic is hard driving?
[150:06.44]I'm going burger boy technique.
[150:08.09]No, fuck all these tech- no, no.
[150:09.31]Screw every one of these.
[150:11.17]These things you guys tell me.
[150:12.11]Full on burger boy technique.
[150:13.17]Let's go.
[150:20.25]What?
[150:20.91]Shit!
[150:25.73]The Burger Boy technique is you just don't give a shit.
[150:47.68]Shit!
[150:53.94]Here we go.
[150:55.06]Right through.
[150:55.50]12th.
[150:56.52]11th.
[150:57.76]Son of a bitch!
[151:05.87]Okay, we're fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[151:06.89]Yeah.
[151:06.99]Full, full throttle.
[151:07.61]Throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle.
[151:10.91]Watch out for this jump.
[151:17.59]Jesus!
[151:21.21]Yes!
[151:31.67]Alright, we're still on fire.
[151:32.67]This is alright.
[151:34.29]Could be worse.
[151:34.75]Let's follow the other drivers.
[151:52.50]Too fast.
[151:53.08]Way too fast.
[151:53.94]Follow back.
[151:57.58]Look at how fast that guy's going.
[151:59.20]No matter to him.
[152:03.38]Nice.
[152:03.68]Dude.
[152:13.34]How many people uninstalled the game at this point?
[152:15.34]You remade the game.
[152:19.95]Hey, let's remake the game and make sure we get to a point where everybody fucking uninstalls it.
[152:23.49]You don't see the next 14 hours of the story.
[152:28.29]They're lined up on the grid.
[152:31.43]They're ready to start.
[152:36.43]being filtered.
[152:37.55]Yeah, well what the fuck?
[152:40.61]I'm not lowering the difficulty yet.
[152:41.97]Not yet.
[152:49.81]That was an anchor bump.
[152:53.69]Yeah, get the fuck out of my way.
[152:57.85]Get out of my way.
[153:01.65]Put this hay here.
[153:19.45]14.
[153:19.51]I'm never going to get to fifth place.
[153:23.45]I need like a TAS to be able to complete this mission.
[153:26.38]Okay.
[154:03.13]Tried driving on the road.
[154:04.47]Yeah I have.
[154:16.82]Dude, what the fuck?
[154:18.98]Why?
[154:20.04]Look at the acceleration.
[154:22.32]That guy went 5,000 miles.
[154:24.31]Look at him.
[154:24.87]I'm holding R. I'm holding down right trigger.
[154:28.03]That guy has... He's going 10 times faster than me.
[154:41.18]Ride the bank.
[154:53.35]Have you tried going as fast as you can?
[154:54.85]Yeah, your car spins around in a circle and every other AI driver drives 500 miles per hour.
[155:06.50]I'm the only one that has to drive the car.
[155:22.86]at least one idiot I get to pass wait a minute wait a minute wait we got a full idiot pile up here
[155:49.22]Easy.
[155:49.50]Don't rip the wheel.
[155:50.25]There he goes.
[155:55.23]Ride the wall.
[156:38.92]I don't care.
[156:39.32]I'm not going to sit here for five hours.
[156:43.76]I don't give a shit.
[156:46.56]I don't care.
[156:46.86]I'm just going to beat it.
[156:47.38]I'm just going to play the game.
[156:48.22]What?
[156:48.44]I have to do the driving mission for four hours?
[156:56.57]If you can beat Simpsons Hit and Run.
[156:57.99]Simpsons Run at least had a car that made sense when you drove it.
[157:04.05]And I know it's an old car.
[157:05.53]Yeah, whatever.
[157:09.31]I'm gonna blow by these fucking assholes on easy.
[157:11.71]This is grandma difficulty.
[157:23.70]Get out of the way.
[157:53.22]I don't care.
[157:54.28]I don't care.
[157:54.90]You can call me terrible.
[157:56.37]You can call me shitty all you want.
[157:58.81]I'm gonna get in first place on easy.
[158:01.37]Hand the controller to your mother game.
[158:05.05]Even this is still hard.
[158:06.15]Oh, shit.
[158:10.31]I can't lose on easy.
[158:11.07]I gotta first try it on easy.
[158:12.09]Otherwise, I have to delete my Twitch account.
[158:25.04]Get off me!
[158:29.00]Get off me!
[158:50.55]Bank, bank, bank, bank.
[158:51.55]I don't need to bank anything.
[158:54.33]This is to win.
[159:02.75]I know.
[159:03.79]I'm trying to kill that guy.
[159:05.77]That's the threat.
[159:06.29]That's the guy in second place.
[159:16.74]I don't care.
[159:17.64]I don't care.
[159:18.34]I know people are going to be making fun of me for years over this.
[159:21.50]Who cares?
[159:30.45]Use the bank?
[159:31.85]I don't even know what that means.
[159:32.89]When I hear you say that, all I think about is withdrawing money from an ATM.
[159:36.46]I don't know about use the bank.
[159:37.74]I don't even know what that means.
[159:38.48]I'm going to win.
[159:39.52]I'm in first place.
[159:39.98]I'm doing fine.
[159:58.62]Oh, tip over.
[159:59.24]Okay, I'm fine.
[160:04.99]I'm embarrassed for him.
[160:06.67]No, you're not.
[160:07.55]It's fine.
[160:08.11]Whatever.
[160:08.59]What does it matter?
[160:12.59]What?
[160:13.17]You know, you're resident sleep.
[160:14.35]Fine, I'll put it on classic mode again.
[160:16.47]Can't lose my Twitch account.
[160:17.29]It's going to get fucking deleted if I don't win.
[160:32.42]That's not for a bank.
[160:41.82]come on this guy's smoking okay I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
[161:07.46]How embarrassing.
[161:09.00]Get those resident sleepers out of here.
[161:10.80]Get those resident sleepers out of here.
[161:12.24]I don't want to see them.
[161:18.53]Get the resident sleepers out of here.
[161:21.51]Fine.
[161:21.71]You want me to turn it on classic?
[161:24.53]Where's the end of the match?
[161:29.91]Alright, fine.
[161:30.33]Let me just get to this next turn and I'll put it on classic mode.
[161:35.48]Where's the finish line?
[161:57.47]Do it now.
[161:58.09]Not yet.
[161:59.59]After I ride the bank, I will.
[162:00.89]Look at this.
[162:01.90]It's all these sleepers.
[162:04.22]Fuck, man.
[162:07.68]What do you want?
[162:08.36]Come on.
[162:08.92]I don't want to... It's alright.
[162:10.36]Look, I'll beat it on classic.
[162:14.82]How does that sound?
[162:28.56]Alright, we did it!
[162:29.56]Hey, I'm getting booed, but I won.
[162:38.85]I'll take the booze.
[162:47.72]Hey, Tommy!
[162:49.98]There's our winner!
[162:53.20]I think you underestimate how much patience I have for that.
[162:56.78]Relapse on classic mode?
[162:57.43]No fucking way.
[162:57.89]Stream would turn off.
[162:59.33]Thanks.
[163:19.34]This is the most spam I've ever seen on my channel.
[163:23.19]Holy shit.
[163:23.79]It's every single person's doing this.
[163:26.87]Every single one of you is doing this.
[163:29.95]Holy shit.
[163:30.37]That must mean it's true.
[163:34.19]Thanks, boss.
[163:36.63]You got a girl, right?
[163:38.01]I don't want you blowing all that on booze and whores.
[163:43.31]Maybe I'll buy my mom a new coat.
[163:45.55]Good boy.
[163:46.63]Go get yourself a drink.
[163:49.28]No, no, no.
[163:50.76]Take off emote only mode.
[163:51.80]I don't want everyone to spam that.
[163:53.12]I want you to break my chat.
[163:54.85]Come on.
[163:55.51]There's almost 10,000 people here.
[163:56.55]I deserve it.
[163:57.01]Thanks.
[164:11.32]Hey, remember when we said that what it would look like if you had bots in your channel?
[164:20.45]This is it right here.
[164:28.27]Now I can just play the game.
[164:29.29]I just want to play the game.
[164:30.79]I just want to experience the story. ...
[164:40.44]Wait, did you say you just put it on easy, Tommy?
[164:42.38]I wasn't paying that much attention.
[164:45.98]Alright, alright, alright.
[164:47.78]No more.
[164:48.14]No more.
[164:48.38]I'm done.
[164:48.60]I don't want to see it anymore.
[164:49.50]No more.
[164:49.94]Okay, no more.
[165:10.05]Put it into cool guy mode.
[165:13.22]Put it in.
[165:13.68]All right.
[165:14.14]No more of that.
[165:16.08]Making me feel self-conscious.
[165:22.30]I'm feeling a little self-conscious right now.
[165:23.93]Where's Polly?
[165:36.92]Here's the funny part.
[165:37.58]The people that come into the stream that see that I've only been streaming for a few hours are going to be like, holy shit, he beat that mission in like an hour or so.
[165:42.99]Pretty good.
[165:43.33]Top tier.
[165:43.75]What?
[165:44.07]Pauly.
[165:44.57]Looking for Pauly.
[165:45.47]Yeah, I'm realizing right now I just did the unforgivable sin.
[165:48.87]I made I put the game on easy.
[166:08.00]On stream.
[166:09.03]On Twitch.
[166:10.11]That was... That was very bad.
[166:12.59]I never should have done that.
[166:14.83]Yep.
[166:15.03]Polly, where the fuck are you?
[166:26.20]I could have put it on normal.
[166:28.08]And got away with it, probably.
[166:29.40]With enough explaining and enough gaslighting.
[166:32.42]Easy, though.
[166:33.78]No.
[166:34.00]It's going to be about a year before you guys get over that one.
[166:40.96]Polly!
[166:44.43]Polly!
[166:44.81]I don't know what Polly looks like.
[166:49.09]I felt like I was holding a microwave.
[167:09.26]All right.
[167:09.54]All right.
[167:10.32]All right.
[167:10.82]Let's continue our playthrough of Mafia.
[167:16.73]There's Pauly.
[167:17.33]Hey, Pauly.
[167:18.11]You're a natural will, man, Tom.
[167:20.03]You seen Pauly anywhere, Vin?
[167:21.63]You said he was gonna go eat the soap.
[167:23.53]Eat.
[167:23.77]Okay, he was gonna eat.
[167:25.59]There's the cafeteria over here.
[167:29.28]I'd ask again that people please leave when requested and refrain from imbibing illicit substances.
[167:35.64]Let's not make it like last year, folks.
[167:39.65]Probably right here.
[167:44.92]Polly?
[167:46.30]Eating?
[167:47.08]Somewhere?
[167:47.40]I think I might have to put it on easy to find him.
[167:55.03]Yeah, it'll probably show me an indicator on the map where he is.
[167:57.53]Not a bad idea.
[168:06.40]Polly?
[168:07.00]Where the hell is he?
[168:09.76]There he is.
[168:11.66]Pauly.
[168:14.66]God damn it, man.
[168:17.94]Why aren't you Pauly?
[168:18.96]For the love of God.
[168:19.80]It says he was eating.
[168:23.31]He's the guy that looks like Jimmy Fallon.
[168:31.03]They all look like Jimmy Fallon.
[168:44.28]Yeah, it's just Jimmy Fallon everywhere.
[168:46.76]These things get faster every- Pauly?
[169:05.89]Faster, yes.
[169:06.79]Entertaining.
[169:07.75]No.
[169:08.31]Some years, it feels like a parade.
[169:10.53]You calling that race a parade?
[169:12.41]Ha ha, well-
[169:14.52]You look like Jimmy Fallon.
[169:16.06]Everybody looks like Jimmy Fallon.
[169:17.32]Of course, he's the guy all the way at the edge of the map lying down.
[169:29.68]The cow says moo and the chicken says quack.
[169:34.00]What does the bird say?
[169:35.54]I don't know, but the security guy back there says you gotta go home.
[169:39.04]That's an asshole.
[169:40.27]You should show some respect.
[169:41.77]Jimmy Fallon?
[169:42.81]That's true, but I'm saying you gotta go home too.
[169:45.63]He does look like Jimmy Fallon.
[169:49.11]Well, okay then.
[169:50.94]I guess.
[169:55.88]Let's go, Jim.
[170:02.44]He's about as funny as Jimmy Fallon.
[170:09.72]You know, I haven't seen Jimmy Fallon do anything in, I don't know, probably seven or eight years.
[170:24.72]He says he hosts the Tonight Show or something, right?
[170:28.18]Oh, no, no, no, that's not true.
[170:30.84]I ate his Ben and Jerry's ice cream.
[170:32.95]Yeah, that was like probably a year ago.
[170:38.71]So I have consumed Jimmy Fallon content.
[170:40.71]And by the way, it sucks.
[170:41.95]It's really not that good.
[171:03.18]Half-baked best Ben and Jerry's ice cream.
[171:05.00]You don't even need a celebrity on that one.
[171:06.32]Or Chunky Monkey.
[171:06.85]Get out of here.
[171:09.49]What do you mean?
[171:10.11]I love Chunky Monkey.
[171:11.13]Chunky Monkey's the best.
[171:25.87]Chunky Monkey without the walnuts would be the best ice cream ever made.
[171:36.08]Well, nah, I don't like nuts in ice cream, really.
[171:41.72]I love pistachio ice cream, but I don't like the pistachios in the ice cream.
[171:45.74]I just like the pistachio-flavored green ice cream.
[171:50.49]Kind of get in the way, I just go around them.
[171:52.79]You're gonna have to clam up for your own sakes.
[171:57.21]What happened?
[171:59.49]What am I doing?
[172:00.19]Oh, shit.
[172:00.81]I just snapped.
[172:01.35]You're right.
[172:01.85]You're right.
[172:02.45]Tom, I want to go with the lady.
[172:20.70]I'm not helping you with that today.
[172:22.94]Fish food.
[172:23.34]Yeah, fish food's pretty good.
[172:25.14]Take me to the blue tropics.
[172:27.87]I don't know.
[172:28.51]I ought to take you home.
[172:30.23]The bridge.
[172:31.87]Take the bridge over to the island.
[172:33.81]Take me to the ladies.

[172:38.41]Go lie down for a few hours.

[173:43.14]Thank you, Zombie Eater.
[173:45.59]Huge money.
[173:47.81]You owe us a chubby bunny, but seeing as that you committed the cardinal sin of changing the game's difficulty to easy on stream, don't you think we deserve something else?
[173:58.42]Maybe.
[173:59.12]I'll think about that.
[174:00.12]I gotta piss.
[174:01.18]Watch the cutscene and relax.
[174:03.98]I'll be right back.
[174:04.60]Sata, the time has been closed.

[176:46.22]Let's open it.
[176:48.62]Alright, now let's run.
[176:58.57]Hello?
[177:00.27]Sarah!
[177:01.77]That for me?
[177:03.17]Yeah, though it's not as much as last time.
[177:06.33]It's enough.
[177:07.49]Nona thinks you're an angel.
[177:09.45]The dawn hates seeing food go to waste.
[177:12.46]And this?
[177:13.68]This has got to be Tommy.
[177:15.76]This is Tommy.
[177:19.87]You're a famous race driver, Tom.
[177:22.03]Everyone talks about you.
[177:24.17]Yeah, she's right.
[177:25.91]They talk about anything in particular besides that I just won the race?
[177:29.47]Nothing about how hard it was?
[177:31.49]Well, anyways... No, not yet.
[177:33.43]Not that I've heard.
[177:34.19]I'll see you at church.
[177:35.75]All right.
[177:36.57]Have a great evening.
[177:38.23]Night.
[177:39.25]Buena notte, Tommy.
[177:46.91]All right, Sarah.
[177:48.65]We had a wonderful date.
[177:50.51]It's been really fun.
[177:51.72]The Trump voice is the lowest form of comedy that you have.
[178:10.48]Donald Trump?
[178:11.16]What are you talking about?
[178:14.30]This is this guy.
[178:15.91]What are you talking about?
[178:17.57]Just because you go like this doesn't mean it's automatically Donald.
[178:21.31]I was doing his voice.
[178:23.21]I wasn't doing Trump.
[178:24.31]No.
[178:24.53]No.
[178:24.91]No.
[178:37.66]When you let me take you on a real date and not some walk home for Luigi, then you get the flowers.
[178:45.16]Eh, that could happen.
[178:47.28]If Pop's not going to stop me seeing one of yous, I think he knows anyway.
[178:51.76]Is there going to be a fight or something here?
[178:53.80]Nah.
[178:54.74]These guys have been creeps to me for weeks, but I didn't tell you as I know what you like.
[179:00.86]I mentioned it to Dad this one time, and all of a sudden he gets you to be my knight in
[179:05.89]No, no, Sarah, don't worry.
[179:06.69]These are all actors.
[179:08.53]All of them.
[179:09.99]Every single fucking one.
[179:10.97]Francis, watch this.
[179:11.83]These guys over here playing dice, they're gonna do the exact same movements over and over again.
[179:19.04]They gotta make sure they stay in the camera.
[179:24.26]They did blocking earlier.
[179:25.58]Pick that up.
[179:40.61]There are cameras in every fucking direction.
[179:45.99]Oh, hey there, darling.
[179:48.80]You stepping out on us?
[179:50.34]Piss off.
[179:52.38]Don't kiss the kitten doll face.
[179:54.88]We'll let your boyfriend watch.
[179:56.30]What do you say?
[179:57.36]We going to have trouble here.
[179:58.95]Trouble started back when you tried to steal our girl, chief.
[180:03.29]You saps aren't careful.
[180:05.19]You'll end up in wooden overcoats.
[180:09.44]Last chance to walk away.
[180:11.48]We ain't frails.
[180:13.36]We know who you work for.
[180:16.10]Salieri might have been the big six when he was younger, but he's all washed up now.
[180:21.36]It's only a matter of time.
[180:22.20]Zoomer hair.
[180:23.14]I don't need Salieri or anyone else.
[180:29.15]Not for this.
[180:33.29]Then let's see what you got, cake eater.
[180:35.83]So I just kicked their asses.
[180:36.83]This is where we led off to.
[180:39.58]Uh, I just pulled a grenade.
[180:41.42]Weapon.
[180:42.60]You still want to fight me?
[180:45.98]Okay.
[181:10.02]Okay, at what point would you run?
[181:11.10]Okay, I run now.
[181:16.30]Oh, no.
[181:17.26]He's changing difficulty to easy.
[181:19.96]This is supposed to be a fist fight.
[181:21.18]Let's get out of here.
[181:23.10]Oof.
[181:40.76]Am I gonna get in trouble for that?
[181:46.80]He pushed me?
[181:52.94]Stab him!
[182:03.71]Holy shit.
[182:08.73]Uh oh, boss.
[182:12.14]Fuck it.
[182:21.85]Oof.
[182:24.03]Fuck.
[182:40.62]This guy would be out in a second, dude.
[182:53.12]Oh, damn it, man.
[182:53.86]How many running hits do I... Do I kill him?
[183:02.88]All right.
[183:05.67]Get to Sarah.
[183:06.21]Give me the bat.
[183:17.74]Alright, they're all actors.
[183:18.66]You got a good right hook.
[183:19.60]I'll give you that.
[183:22.58]You're bleeding.
[183:24.44]Come up to my place.
[183:25.72]I'll take a look.
[183:28.02]Am I though?
[183:28.59]Was I supposed to be bleeding?
[183:38.69]Well, you gonna come in and take a load off or what?
[183:44.31]Their blood is all over my arms.
[183:49.24]The bank's closed, Slugger.
[183:50.66]I'm just gonna patch you up is all.
[183:52.54]Now go sit down on the couch, roll up your sleeve.
[183:55.36]I'm getting my sewing kit.
[184:04.31]Doesn't look too bad.
[184:05.91]Where?
[184:07.33]You need something for the pain?
[184:08.87]Oh, it's on the arm.
[184:10.93]You don't have to do that.
[184:12.59]What?
[184:13.67]I can see it fucking hurts, Tom.
[184:15.75]You want to pretend and don't go ask Polly to staple you up.
[184:19.87]What do you get?
[184:23.77]Compliments of the Dan.
[184:24.93]Nice.
[184:36.36]Take another.

[186:43.25]She started working here before she could see over the bar.
[186:47.16]I don't have a daughter of my own, Tom.
[186:50.12]I'd do anything for Luigi's little girl.
[186:52.89]So would I.
[186:55.80]We all would.
[186:56.34]That's right, boss.
[186:58.96]Anything for Luigi and Sarah.
[187:00.32]Do those bastards think this is fucking Luna Park or something?
[187:02.82]I'd just say Jimmy Fallon.
[187:04.13]I'll rip him apart with my own hands.
[187:06.23]I'm waiting for him to start laughing and look into the camera and giggle and shit.

[187:50.23]You got it, boss.
[187:50.89]Go.
[187:50.95]I'm gonna take a selfie with an anime character filter.
[188:07.94]I don't know what that means.
[188:10.82]Like a Snapchat thing?
[188:11.90]I don't have Snapchat.
[188:12.72]Alright, talk to Vincenzo.
[188:21.43]Can I get in the car?
[188:22.11]Talk to Vincenzo.
[188:22.81]Alright, talk to Vincenzo.
[188:29.90]You got a new weapon for me?
[188:31.24]Give me like a grenade or something.
[188:35.71]Why is this guy the- 1930's Q from James Bond.
[189:05.00]It's just baseball bats.
[189:08.63]This is not something old.
[189:12.25]Yeah, what an elaborate thing.
[189:13.79]You could just go buy these at Walmart.
[189:15.93]Why do we need a guy for this?
[189:17.82]Just go get some baseball bats.
[189:19.50]Anywhere.
[189:20.08]In the fucking whole world.
[189:23.06]We really need a guy for that?
[189:41.61]1930s.
[189:42.29]Mafia James Bond.
[189:44.53]Hey, here's a bat.
[189:46.63]Oh, cool.
[189:47.07]This is a normal bat.
[189:47.91]Just the top open and a little gun comes out.
[189:49.79]Just a little knife that shoots out and stabs somebody with a dart.
[189:52.47]Nah.
[189:53.48]You just hit him in the fucking skull.
[189:55.56]And they die.
[189:57.50]Oh.
[189:58.94]Okay.
[189:59.84]It's corked.
[190:16.07]I can't drive past this.
[190:17.89]I like the rain, though.
[190:19.89]Nice touch.
[190:20.55]Why even shape them into bats?
[190:29.76]Just buy wood.
[190:32.52]Just go to Home Depot and buy a bunch of 2x4s, cut them in half, and use those instead.
[190:37.70]It's probably cheaper.
[190:40.52]Why does it have to be a bat?
[190:46.99]It does the same thing.
[190:47.79]It's a piece of wood that's heavy.
[190:49.95]You hit somebody with it.
[190:51.67]Did it break?
[190:52.15]Well, a bat would break too, wouldn't it?
[190:53.53]Alright, Polly.
[190:54.11]What are we doing?
[191:05.79]I want to get my bat.
[191:07.63]Follow Bally to Biff's pawn shop.
[191:35.98]I gotta keep following Polly.

[192:27.45]You'll find him there.
[192:28.77]Thanks.
[192:29.93]See you around.
[192:31.04]Hey, Paulie.
[192:32.74]About that dough?
[192:34.02]Relax.
[192:34.70]Just waiting for my guy to come through.
[192:36.34]Okay.
[192:40.15]I feel like I'm having deja vu.
[192:42.39]I really am.
[192:43.47]This is like mission four in a row besides the racing one where Q gives you a baseball bat and you walked into a store with it.
[192:50.80]But I don't even use it.
[193:01.48]Can we go back to the car racing?
[193:05.12]No, I'm not doing that.
[193:06.06]I already beat it.
[193:07.13]It was really hard.
[193:08.57]But I did it though.
[193:09.65]There's what?
[193:31.70]S station?
[193:35.50]It's sub one hour, yeah.
[193:36.50]It's true.
[193:36.86]Can we at least run?
[194:00.62]This game's really fun and it's really cool, but they really do like to slow down to L.A.
[194:04.32]Noire levels in some of these missions.
[194:10.25]Kick the door.
[194:12.09]I'm telling you, nicest ass I've ever seen in my life.
[194:15.81]Oh, Billy, it's the guy from the other night.
[194:18.91]We gotta go.
[194:25.43]Synchronize cigarettes.
[194:27.67]Synchronize cigarettes is what I was going to say.
[194:40.09]It's a Marvel movie?
[194:45.57]This guy's gonna bat too.
[194:56.68]Captain America?
[194:58.62]They are doing the Marvel movie 1, 2, 3 sequence.
[195:03.22]Punch.
[195:03.66]Block.
[195:04.08]Punch.
[195:04.48]Punch.
[195:06.32]Block with one arm.
[195:07.00]Punch with left arm.
[195:07.88]Block.
[195:08.26]Punch.
[195:10.34]Into the stomach.
[195:10.84]Into the chest.
[195:11.34]Into the head.
[195:13.55]One at a time.
[195:14.23]Yeah.
[195:22.99]It always makes this really crazy sound.
[195:24.55]Like this like... When they punch.
[195:28.71]It's like...
[195:33.51]Oh wait, I have to run around.
[195:41.80]Let's go this way.
[195:52.34]Jump over it!
[195:55.74]What?
[195:56.22]Oh shit!
[195:58.50]Oh, that guy's on fire!
[196:02.02]I didn't even do this.
[196:02.90]I feel like I didn't do anything.
[196:19.35]I keep shooting this guy in the ass.
[196:20.76]Is he dead?
[196:35.06]What?
[196:35.28]That was right in the fucking head.
[196:36.36]We're good.
[196:44.21]I have two bullets left.
[196:45.19]Uh-oh.
[196:50.37]It's not on easy.
[196:51.11]This is on classic mode.
[196:58.38]The health?
[196:58.74]Chair?
[197:02.38]Chair?
[197:10.00]Wait, who's who?
[197:13.52]Who's who?
[197:15.16]Was that guy a friend?
[197:16.22]I don't know.
[197:16.62]Is this a bad guy?
[197:19.48]I think we did it.
[197:26.40]Is this hot?
[197:31.31]Can I go in here?
[197:49.62]He's not good either.
[197:50.64]It's okay.
[197:52.20]We both got surprised.
[197:53.32]He's the one that opened the door.
[197:58.64]How is he so surprised to see me?
[197:59.96]Hands up!
[198:07.25]Catch up to Billy.
[198:08.11]Oh shit, catch up to Billy.
[198:16.89]Fucking whack-a-mole.
[198:20.31]He dropped it.
[198:21.61]Nice throw.
[198:22.91]Nice throw.
[198:23.39]Watch out.
[198:30.33]Watch out.
[198:30.65]Watch out.
[198:30.95]Watch out.
[198:34.93]I get him.
[198:44.80]One more guy.
[198:46.10]Where is he?
[198:49.34]Who's shooting?
[198:49.78]He's aiming the gun at me.
[199:03.10]Tommy, look out.
[199:03.58]What?
[199:06.72]Stupid idea.
[199:08.16]Very stupid.
[199:09.70]Completely out of your element there, man.
[199:11.75]You can run straight at me with a gun.
[199:19.73]Random crit?
[199:20.33]Oh, not this shit.
[199:21.83]Don't let the punks escape.
[199:23.71]Sure, I'll get it.
[199:43.28]Alright, I have 21 shots.
[199:44.98]That's not a whole lot of ammo.
[199:48.30]It's raining, too.
[199:49.06]I gotta be careful.
[199:49.56]Oh, boy.
[199:51.08]Oh, we're good.
[200:17.36]Shit.
[200:20.80]Road is so slippery.
[200:28.08]Don't.
[200:28.36]I'm gonna lose him.
[200:48.51]Fuck.
[201:03.00]We could've just chased him on foot and it would've been better.
[201:05.25]At least we could've snuck down alleyways.
[201:15.32]How did he pass the racing mission?
[201:16.82]That was pretty tough.
[201:17.96]Took me a while.
[201:20.31]Really zeroed in, though.
[201:23.13]On the menu.
[201:24.35]When I made it easy.
[201:27.17]Oh, come on, dude.
[201:28.57]Seriously.
[201:29.03]Jesus.
[201:30.74]Oh.
[201:31.02]I'm sorry.
[201:31.80]We got Luigi'd.
[201:45.43]This is a bit.
[201:46.49]They're going to wake up with guns.
[201:47.93]Go on a poppy, Tom.
[201:59.21]No.
[201:59.81]Through the game.
[202:00.45]Please.
[202:03.27]Please, I don't want to fucking die, man.
[202:10.60]Christ, Tom.
[202:12.73]You can't feel sorry for these animals.
[202:14.55]A guy like this would plug you if you give him the chance.
[202:17.87]Gotta pull the trigger without thinking.
[202:20.23]That car is mangled.
[202:23.69]What did they crash into?
[202:27.61]This one's finished, too.
[202:30.23]They weren't going that fast.
[202:32.63]Ugh.
[202:45.55]Oh, Christ, Tom.
[202:47.25]Ah, shit, he disconnected.
[202:48.37]Snap out of it.
[202:50.72]I'll wait.
[202:51.62]He might come back.
[202:52.16]You know what those guys wanted to do to Sarah?
[202:54.48]James' fucking multiplayer sucks, dummy.
[202:56.20]I swear to God.
[202:58.88]Just, uh... Hey.
[203:01.44]Let's get out of here before the wolves show up, huh?
[203:14.11]Where'd he get used to it?
[203:19.21]He was in the pause menu setting it to easy.
[203:21.25]That's pretty good.
[203:24.58]That's really good.
[203:31.56]Simple straight.
[203:35.26]Nice.
[203:36.12]Very nice.
[203:39.54]I can't afford this life no more.
[203:41.73]Just getting lucky.
[203:43.17]I'll give you a chance to win your money back.
[203:45.69]You want in, boss?
[203:48.58]We have business to discuss, Paulie.
[203:51.16]We're in it now, boys.
[203:52.82]One of our associates at the corner in this office sent this over.
[203:56.48]Corpse's name is Giootti.
[203:59.78]You recognize him?
[204:01.38]Sure.
[204:02.28]That's one of the punks we ran out of the neighborhood.
[204:04.91]Now he got the bullet in the back of his head?
[204:06.53]He did it.
[204:07.19]He did it.
[204:07.67]Jimmy Fallon did it.
[204:08.97]Well, the cops ought to thank us.
[204:10.15]We did him a favor.
[204:11.45]The guy was a rapist, boss.
[204:12.87]Yeah?
[204:14.11]Well, he was also a city counselor's son.
[204:16.74]You want to drive a politician into Morello's arms?
[204:19.04]There's no better way than killing off his family.
[204:21.38]Christ.
[204:21.98]It gets worse.
[204:23.36]You left another guy in the wreck?
[204:25.00]In any piece of media, is there ever a senator's son that's not a bad guy?
[204:31.41]If you're going to do a job, do it right.
[204:33.45]He made it?
[204:34.53]Yes.
[204:35.51]He spent the weekend at Mary's, but... You killed that guy.
[204:38.09]He was a senator's son.
[204:39.47]Can he point a finger at either of you?
[204:41.05]He was a murderer, rapist, killer, drug addict.
[204:44.74]And he, like, beat up dogs for fun.
[204:49.66]Senator's son, by the way.
[204:51.76]How will I recognize him?
[205:01.64]He'll be the one who just crawled away from a car wreck.
[205:04.68]His arm is broken.
[205:05.92]Look for a sling.
[205:07.78]Sam's gonna need a little distraction if he's gonna clean up your mess.
[205:11.67]Are you sending Tommy to dip his wick?
[205:14.47]It's a brothel?
[205:15.33]A gentleman's club, just down the street from St.
[205:17.65]Michael's.
[205:18.79]Madonna's invested a lot of money in it over the years.
[205:21.83]So have me and Sam.
[205:24.14]Regardless, the owner has suddenly decided to do business with Morello instead of us.
[205:29.88]You want me to go remind him of his obligations?
[205:32.32]Yes.
[205:33.76]Then blow the place up.
[205:35.80]What?
[205:36.86]Morello wants to take businesses away from us?
[205:39.50]He'll inherit craters.
[205:41.04]Look, Tom, we can't send Paulie and Sam since all the ladies know them already.
[205:45.20]Are we trying to not have so much heat put on us?
[205:48.01]But you can walk right in.
[205:52.09]Okay.
[205:54.52]What about the manager?
[205:55.42]Like I could syringe somebody.
[205:56.94]If any of the whores see it, well, it'll be a warning.
[206:00.92]Once he's out of the way, head to his office on the top floor.
[206:04.34]Grab any documents and money you find there and place the explosives.
[206:07.97]Vincenza will see that you have what you need.
[206:10.73]And you think the blast will be big enough to give me cover?
[206:13.23]Yeah, but be smart.
[206:15.57]Only take a shot if you know you won't get me.
[206:19.09]Tommy, one more thing.
[206:21.41]one of the girls is passing morello information about our operations before you blow the place you'll need to take care of her too you want tommy to kill a twist come on frank it's just bad luck this falls to tom but we got to protect the family her name is michelle wait we'll have to she's usually working one of the upper rooms gonna kill some lady her photo is in the folder you boys clear on everything
[206:54.48]What a reaction to have of a thing that you're watching.
[206:59.45]Do I have to kill some lady?
[207:11.14]Yeah, man.
[207:11.92]You probably should already know why and who that is.
[207:14.40]And it sounds like some lady you're killing.
[207:16.98]What are you talking about, dude?
[207:18.00]Are you even watching?
[207:21.21]Am I playing Candy Crush on my phone during every cutscene?
[207:25.19]Sometimes it feels like that.
[207:35.39]But I'm not, though.
[207:36.05]I'm just staring blankly into the colors.
[207:39.46]Okay, what do you got for me, Q?
[207:44.01]Thank you.
[207:46.28]Nothing special, just electrical tape and dynamite.
[207:49.40]Thanks, Q. Not today, Vinny.
[207:50.96]We have to get in.
[208:07.52]Don't go anyplace yet.
[208:09.64]Gotta hear me out on this.
[208:10.56]Uh-oh, we're gonna get some exposition.
[208:12.22]Michelle?
[208:12.96]Right.
[208:14.49]You don't have to rub her out.
[208:16.71]Just make her disappear.
[208:18.69]You know her?
[208:19.63]Yeah.
[208:21.39]I've been with her a few times.
[208:23.73]She's a good egg, Tom.
[208:25.37]Just maybe not so bright.
[208:28.18]And don't kill her.
[208:28.92]100 bucks.
[208:29.16]100 dollars in 1930 was like 10 grand.
[208:30.50]That's a lot of money.
[208:49.36]Uh, hey, uh, Pauly, was that her?
[208:50.68]Hope not.
[208:51.34]Oops.
[209:23.12]Okay, we're fine.
[209:24.10]Keep your head when you get into the hotel.
[209:26.35]Find your mark and don't act suspicious.
[209:28.97]The manager thinks he's untouchable.
[209:30.51]You can probably walk right up to him.
[209:33.41]Is that for the gunshot?
[209:35.33]Just don't take all that.
[209:36.29]100 was about 1.2k.
[209:37.17]That's a lot of money.
[209:39.79]If the bomb goes off, I'll do my thing.
[209:43.90]Got it.
[209:48.28]What's with you today, Tom?
[209:52.01]What kind of world is it?
[209:53.71]I want to ride a motorcycle.
[209:55.11]You get sent to a cat house.
[209:57.22]Well, I have to clean up.
[209:59.36]Shit, wrong button.
[210:04.94]Isn't that a cop right there?
[210:10.87]Anyway, we won't tell the God about that one.
[210:16.17]Unhinged.
[210:16.37]Oh, I was just trying to get the fuck out of the way!
[210:38.38]Come on.
[210:39.28]Are we going to get everybody standing up on the high ground here?
[210:42.20]What, in GTA you never ran over a pedestrian before?
[210:47.74]Of course not.
[210:48.78]I stopped at every red light and I used my turn signal.
[210:52.81]It's the funerals, Tom.
[210:54.71]That's all it ever is.
[210:56.49]Not me.
[210:57.29]Of course not.
[210:57.95]All that anyone ever wants to do is point guns at the family and shoot.
[211:01.69]Game point, there were so many funerals.
[211:03.55]I actually do.
[211:04.47]Stop going to most of them.
[211:06.36]That's how you make GTA, like, a 500-hour game.
[211:08.54]Say that in court, Germa.
[211:09.32]Here's your stuff.
[211:26.44]I'd stand up and be like, what, you're never in GTA?
[211:28.56]Yeah, I would be my own defense.
[211:34.14]Your Honor, in Grand Theft Auto, you run over people.
[211:39.81]You never done that before, Judge?
[211:42.83]You never ran over an old lady in the crosswalk in GTA?
[211:54.04]They would get flustered.
[211:54.84]Wow.
[211:56.98]Case dismissed.
[212:10.94]Please.
[212:11.60]Okay.
[212:17.86]I didn't say I didn't do it.
[212:19.52]See, it was not necessary.
[212:21.08]I didn't have to do it.
[212:21.72]There's no reason to do that.
[212:24.19]Just trying to get out of the way.
[212:28.89]Enter the hotel.
[212:39.09]I have a bomb, don't I?
[212:47.45]Oh shit, do I have to get searched?
[212:49.35]Send a message from Don Salieri.
[212:52.24]Find Michelle, find the manager.
[212:54.01]Know where I can find the manager?
[212:55.71]I just watch the door, pal.
[212:59.19]Nobody cares.
[213:09.34]Okay.
[213:10.14]Find Michelle.
[213:13.20]Hey, handsome.
[213:13.86]You know where I can find Michelle?
[213:16.42]You here for a girl, drinks, or a mix of the two?
[213:20.64]A girl.
[213:22.07]And I got some business with your manager, too.
[213:24.46]A girl?
[213:25.26]I can help you with.
[213:26.40]Come through.
[213:27.50]Wait, hold on.
[213:28.12]The guy had a gun.
[213:28.80]Put that away.
[213:29.14]Oh, shit.
[213:29.38]Okay, he's hidden.
[213:30.14]Find Michelle.
[213:49.69]Why don't you find me a drink?
[213:51.13]Michelle.
[213:51.37]Because you're not the dame I'm after.
[213:53.57]No, Michelle.
[213:54.55]I'm new here, baby.
[213:55.25]I don't know a thing.
[213:55.81]Why don't you just walk up to everybody and say, Michelle.
[213:59.14]No, Michelle.
[214:00.36]No, Michelle.
[214:01.12]Yes?
[214:02.36]Or just yell.
[214:03.42]Michelle!
[214:04.90]Somebody's head's gonna turn.
[214:05.70]Yeah, what?
[214:06.42]Hey, I need you.
[214:08.00]I need to speak to Michelle.
[214:09.50]The only girls available are the girls you can see.
[214:12.57]Find one you like and don't make a fuss.
[214:16.53]We can just talk if you don't want anything else.
[214:20.55]What's a handsome man like you doing in a place like this?
[214:24.67]Looking for a girl named Michelle.
[214:26.83]She's busy upstairs, but... That's all I needed to know.
[214:30.21]Can I get a drink?
[214:34.22]Look at that droid.
[214:36.42]Yeah, I'll take a large espresso from the golden R2-D2, please.
[214:49.11]All right, we just go upstairs and find Michelle.
[214:50.69]Michelle?
[214:50.93]Uh... Okay.
[214:51.09]Okay, kill the manager in the lounge?
[214:52.39]Why did this become Hitman?
[215:25.32]What?
[215:25.72]Whose room is this?
[215:26.80]It was that easy.
[215:27.77]Okay.
[215:27.91]208.
[215:27.93]I don't even need you anymore.
[215:28.73]Where's 208?
[215:48.15]This is 101.
[215:48.65]I don't even need to be in here.
[215:50.03]What am I?
[215:50.43]No.
[215:50.73]This lady's going to poison me.
[215:51.81]I'm going to say it's going to poison me.
[215:53.67]I know it.
[215:54.73]I guarantee this lady poisons me.
[215:56.07]You're going to poison me.
[216:06.58]I know I'm going to get poisoned.
[216:07.68]I swear to God.
[216:08.14]Is this 208?
[216:27.76]What's in here?
[216:34.00]Everybody is a threat right now.
[216:36.80]It doesn't matter.
[216:37.30]People are going to kill you.
[216:39.40]They have guns.
[216:39.86]They have knives.
[216:40.50]I'm protecting myself.
[216:51.87]Psycho.
[216:54.35]You treat women like this?
[216:56.39]You treat your mother like
[216:59.04]See?
[216:59.34]Everyone's a fucking threat.
[217:00.26]Look at these threats.
[217:01.10]I'm telling you.
[217:07.75]Wait, who's who?
[217:10.45]Wait, is this a bad guy?
[217:11.63]Who's the bad guy?
[217:15.88]I don't know.
[217:16.22]I don't know which one was the bad guy.
[217:17.08]I have no idea.
[217:18.60]Okay, easy.
[217:20.40]Do you know where Michelle is?
[217:22.88]You're the bad guy.
[217:38.94]Alright, I need to go up.
[217:39.74]Where's the staircase?
[217:42.36]Why is nobody getting me in trouble for doing these crazy things?
[217:45.97]2-0, where is it?
[218:11.07]Bible?
[218:11.61]No.
[218:12.43]Shoes?
[218:12.87]No.
[218:13.81]Car down there.
[218:14.37]Can I change?
[218:21.67]Oh, 202.
[218:21.85]Wait, wait, wait.
[218:22.75]What's this?
[218:25.01]Yeah, 208.
[218:25.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[218:26.23]Find Michelle in 208.
[218:26.85]210.
[218:26.87]Where's 208?
[218:27.21]201.
[218:27.23]209.
[218:28.07]Okay.
[218:41.54]208.
[218:41.80]Oh, it's just on the... Okay.
[218:43.39]This is where I have to be.
[218:45.62]Should I knock on the door?
[218:58.68]Excuse me, do you know where Michelle is?
[219:01.12]Hey
[219:38.87]I didn't kill everybody.
[219:39.77]The first lady I thought the door was gonna close and she was gonna stab me or poison me or something.
[219:49.38]Second room.
[219:49.96]There's two guys in there.
[219:51.74]One of them was beating one up.
[219:52.62]I choked one of them, then I punched the other guy.
[219:54.23]What about the security guard?
[219:55.35]Yeah, that's true.
[219:55.95]I can't... I have no excuse for the security guard.
[219:57.49]I just kind of did it.
[220:22.56]Alright, we're good.
[220:36.83]Kill the manager in the lounge.
[220:40.83]Killing everybody besides the manager in the lounge.
[220:43.07]Don't I have a bomb?
[220:57.66]Back downstairs.
[221:07.11]Oh, it's okay.
[221:07.53]Someone's just jumping on the bed.
[221:22.78]Psycho.
[221:30.56]Alright, don't hurt anybody.
[221:34.92]There he is.
[221:35.94]Alright, how do I kill this guy?
[221:38.07]I guess I could just go walk up and put my hands on his neck.
[221:44.09]But I don't think that's going to work.
[221:52.28]Can I talk to him?
[221:56.35]No, there's got to be some weird hitman thing to do with this.
[222:05.68]I'm going to drop a chandelier on him or something, right?
[222:16.56]Poison?
[222:18.22]Why do I think there's poison in this game?
[222:20.28]It's not showing up at all.
[222:22.72]Why did I think I was going to get poisoned?
[222:26.21]Like, here, have a drink.
[222:27.07]And I was going to die.
[222:27.85]Why did I think that was going to happen?
[222:30.61]I actually just have to kill this guy.
[222:36.61]I guess.
[222:48.39]Oh, he'll go to the bathroom.
[222:49.83]He's going to go to the bathroom eventually.
[222:51.43]And we'll just choke him out of the bathroom.
[222:56.95]If you want a girl, head back to the bar.
[222:59.70]They'll come over and keep you entertained.
[223:03.86]Shoot him.
[223:05.70]No, I don't want to shoot him.
[223:07.20]Why is there blood all over the place?
[223:08.96]Are you with the Morello party, sir?
[223:11.79]Oh, it's me.
[223:16.19]Are you with the Morello party, sir?
[223:21.19]He's not going to move.
[223:22.01]Just shoot him.
[223:22.81]But everyone called me a psycho when I punched that lady and when I choked that guy to death.
[223:27.32]I don't want to be the psycho anymore.
[223:28.64]I want to do the correct way.
[223:39.03]Run, run, run, run, run!
[223:44.13]Run!
[223:45.25]I don't know if that's a bad guy or not.
[223:49.79]REACH THE MANAGER'S OFFICE?!
[223:51.23]WHAT?!
[223:54.48]Oh, fuck!
[224:04.38]What's the go- I- I- I don't want to be the psycho.
[224:12.29]I wasn't!
[224:12.69]I was running away!
[224:13.71]I did what I had to do and I ran away!
[224:18.57]What is happening?
[224:19.21]Oh.
[224:21.26]I don't want to... Um... Don't listen to chat.
[224:31.94]Just go and reach the manager's office.
[224:34.49]This guy... Okay, like the concierge just ran in with a shotgun.
[224:38.33]And you're telling me that not everybody here was a threat?
[224:40.01]That was the bellhop.
[225:12.93]Alright, reach the manager's office.
[225:13.85]Let's go.
[225:17.71]I'll take the shotgun.
[225:19.29]Oh, hell yeah.
[225:19.95]Alright, let's go reload this.
[225:32.76]Oh, shit.
[225:33.26]Where is he?
[225:45.35]Show yourself.
[225:53.52]Neither one of us knows who we're aiming at right now.
[226:03.82]Is there a heal?
[226:09.14]There's no heal box, is there?
[226:25.27]Oh, back in the kitchen?
[226:27.61]Oh, where?
[226:38.40]Sick.
[226:38.82]Thank you.
[226:43.58]There we go.
[226:44.20]Now I got tons of ammo for the shotgun.
[226:46.12]We're good.
[227:07.45]Yeah, I just like skimmed him.
[227:18.19]Oh.
[227:21.63]Nobody left, right?
[227:28.64]I have no idea.
[227:30.46]Oh my goodness.
[227:40.19]Everybody's a threat.
[227:41.61]Everybody's a threat.
[227:43.61]Even the naked guy.
[227:44.65]Whoa.
[228:18.48]Where is he?
[228:26.94]Any health in here?
[228:30.68]Oh shit.
[228:39.71]Oh!
[228:49.57]Remember, this is not a kill everyone scenario.
[228:51.09]This is a get out scenario.
[228:54.12]Alright, that's cool.
[228:59.59]Just run.
[229:03.89]Your game reward is causing lag.
[229:30.95]Where's his office?
[229:36.11]I was right there.
[229:37.01]Shit.
[229:42.55]Oh, god damn it.
[229:43.63]That was so close.
[229:47.66]It actually worked for a minute.
[229:51.40]Why are you playing with a controller?
[229:52.78]Because my game reward is going to get in the way and it's going to hurt if I press W. Because when I press W, it's going to scrape against the E key.
[230:00.37]I mean, the mouse, the mouse, no, it's not even, that's the wrong hand.
[230:20.59]Somebody else shot him in the head, not me.
[230:27.77]Oh shit!
[230:50.87]End of the hallway, that's it.
[230:51.59]I just gotta get to the end of the hallway.
[230:52.59]I was doing, like, covering fire.
[231:12.29]There's another guy right there.
[231:31.24]Did I shoot myself in the side of the head?
[231:38.26]Did I lean forward to peek and then shoot myself?
[232:05.80]Dude, give me a fucking break.
[232:07.08]Where is this guy shooting at me from?
[232:08.68]Holy shit, that was a loud yell.
[232:31.27]He did not fucking hit me.
[232:47.75]Same bullshit.
[232:48.57]Explosive right here.
[232:49.35]Ready?
[232:55.82]Fucking come on.
[233:07.42]Slow the difficulty to regular.
[233:08.76]Don't be on classic mode.
[233:10.01]I'm not going to put it.
[233:12.29]No, I can't do that more than once.
[233:20.90]You know why I hate video games so much?
[233:24.92]Because you have to put your mouse sensitivity down to like 0.5 in every fucking video game.
[233:29.37]Do you guys realize?
[233:29.85]Do you guys notice that?
[233:30.57]Who the fuck play- Why would they ever have a like 5.0 sensitivity?
[233:35.67]What's the point of having that even be an option?
[233:43.11]It's a little too low.
[234:03.23]Why does this feel so laggy?
[234:07.72]I think it's because it is.
[234:08.72]Alright, this same stupid... Get up!
[234:38.48]It's gonna explode.
[234:39.34]Just get rid of it first.
[234:41.64]Someone's gonna shoot that.
[234:42.34]It's gonna kill me.
[234:51.75]That's just ducking in plain sight.
[234:53.47]The controller was sitting on my lap.
[234:54.61]I put it on the desk.
[235:04.09]Turn on aim assist.
[235:06.03]Wouldn't I want to turn it off?
[235:12.49]Is it like pulling me over to other enemies?
[235:15.03]No.
[235:30.79]Fucking die!
[235:41.03]It's bugged.
[235:41.59]Turn on VSync.
[235:43.01]Is that real?
[235:43.61]I don't think that's real.
[235:50.92]You're alive?
[235:51.60]You gotta turn vegetation on.
[235:59.18]Same fucking doorway.
[236:05.35]There he is.
[236:09.04]You can't be serious.
[236:10.56]The same guy shoots me in the head every time.
[236:16.81]Why is this guy so impossible for me to kill?
[236:18.81]I shot him right in the neck.
[236:37.99]What was that?
[236:44.15]Oh my fucking god.
[236:45.59]Why is it like this?
[236:46.59]Use the gamer instinct.
[237:18.26]Oh my fucking god.
[237:19.72]Are you kidding me?
[237:22.02]Because I replaced my gun in the beginning of the level when I choked out the fucking bellhop.
[237:26.72]And I took the shitty gun.
[237:35.29]Really?
[237:36.61]Really?
[237:37.01]No.
[237:37.07]Alright, I gotta replace this gun.
[237:44.64]This thing sucks.
[237:45.48]I'm like shooting BBs at these guys.
[237:50.50]Give me your gun.
[237:52.47]What do you have?
[237:53.19]Thank you.
[237:53.63]Oh my god.
[237:54.41]What the hell was I thinking?
[237:59.42]What was I doing?
[238:00.22]What was wrong with me?
[238:20.15]What are you doing?
[238:26.93]Guy in the hat.
[238:32.69]This guy's in my head.
[238:34.32]This dude is in my head so bad.
[238:35.52]He really is.
[238:36.42]Yeah.
[238:41.28]I shot that guy.
[238:42.66]Okay.
[238:42.78]I don't even know what happened.
[238:44.02]That guy exploded.
[238:56.83]Don't!
[238:57.14]Don't!
[239:01.97]Use your grenades?
[239:02.68]I don't have any grenades.
[239:27.70]Oh, shit.
[239:28.20]Give me the controller.
[239:28.66]I don't know what to do.
[239:29.20]Do I have anything else?
[239:36.05]Give me another gun.
[239:38.70]Give me a gun.
[240:06.63]There's one more guy.
[240:07.77]There's no bullets in any of these guns.
[240:27.25]What are you doing?
[240:28.47]I don't even know where he is.
[240:38.49]Where is he?
[240:47.62]Holy shit, what an idiot.
[240:53.30]Hit the safe.
[241:02.25]I'll take this one for sure.
[241:03.17]This is a sawed-off shotgun?
[241:15.16]What?
[241:15.30]Why does the guy have a spotlight all over him?
[241:26.93]Can I get him out?
[241:29.39]Clown?
[241:33.47]No, I'm not going to kill this guy, okay?
[241:37.26]I am not going to do that.
[241:38.76]I've done enough.
[241:39.86]I've done enough like punching and fighting and shooting and stuff.
[241:43.14]I'm not going to do it.
[241:44.38]Not going to happen.
[241:45.10]Not right now.
[241:48.66]Shoot the chair.
[241:49.44]Alright, I might shoot the chair.
[241:52.04]Can I shoot the chair without killing him?
[241:53.38]You're going to blow up the... What?
[242:05.42]Oh, wait, this guy's... Yeah, how do I... I'm going to blow up the whole building?
[242:08.57]Take money and documents, okay?
[242:16.85]Get that document.
[242:23.32]Money.
[242:24.76]Documents.
[242:29.04]Alright.
[242:30.08]Land the bomb.
[242:30.68]Doesn't matter where.
[242:36.96]That clown guy really is just kind of still in there.
[243:00.82]He's just tied up.
[243:16.75]Okay, I blew out an office.
[243:18.53]I didn't blow up the building.
[243:20.37]Oh, we're good.
[243:26.20]Get to the roof?
[243:28.46]Are those police shooting at me?
[243:53.22]Why did it look like my body was on backwards?
[244:06.53]I find a way up to the roof.
[244:08.38]Alright, but where are they actually...
[244:25.73]I don't think I can get rid of these guys.
[244:32.90]I have a shotgun that I'm going to shoot into windows that are like 500 feet away from me.
[244:58.46]Restart chapter.
[245:01.08]Oh my goodness.
[245:05.84]I am gonna have to just run.
[245:06.85]Slow down.
[245:11.35]Go go go go go.
[245:27.93]What difficulty is this?
[245:28.85]Classic.
[245:29.33]Hide and just heal.
[245:45.11]Do I have any other guns?
[245:51.21]I don't.
[245:52.05]I just have a stupid shotgun, man.
[246:13.85]I can get him.
[246:16.24]Oh, shit.
[246:20.76]I get him?
[246:22.12]I got him.
[246:24.20]Go, go.
[246:24.38]While they're distracted.
[246:25.16]While they're shot.
[246:40.65]I'm in trouble now.
[246:44.35]Why did I switch to the dumb shotgun?
[246:46.27]Because it was on the ground and I thought it might be fun to use.
[246:53.70]Alright.
[246:54.30]What am I going to do?
[246:55.78]I think I have to kill these guys.
[247:14.19]Are they gone?
[247:19.35]I saw the guy in the eye.
[247:20.39]That guy doesn't have an eye.
[247:21.19]Alright, one's dead.
[247:23.72]One of them's dead.
[247:29.98]This is my actual opportunity here.
[247:31.96]I'm going to wait until he reloads and I'm going to run.
[247:35.42]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[247:36.54]Okay, ready?
[247:36.96]Let's count.
[247:38.29]1, 2, 3.
[247:39.07]5, 6.
[247:47.12]One, two, three, four.
[247:48.16]One, two, three, four, five, six, five, six.
[247:50.28]And... One, two, come on.
[247:53.69]Not gonna fire?
[248:23.10]Okay, I'm alright.
[248:25.40]Nobody right here.
[248:26.05]I don't have a gun.
[248:35.01]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[248:36.21]There's a guy.
[248:36.63]Okay, there's a guy with a gun, but there's a health pack right here.
[248:42.29]I want everyone we've got on this guy.
[248:44.34]Get up there and bring him down.
[248:45.98]Look at these boxes.
[248:48.02]Get out of my way, please.
[248:48.76]Can I zipline?
[248:52.77]There's a dude right here with a gun.
[248:54.07]I didn't- Holy shit, I'm okay.
[249:22.06]I got one more bullet.
[249:32.44]Push guns.
[249:32.84]I need that gun.
[249:41.11]Where is it?
[250:00.40]Alright, well I'm headshotting his hand.
[250:08.67]Up.
[250:14.39]You're headshotting the fence.
[250:17.59]Kind of, but not really.
[250:29.21]Don't do it.
[250:29.59]It's not worth it.
[250:30.13]It's not worth it.
[250:30.59]It's not worth it.
[250:31.05]It's not worth it.
[250:31.53]Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.
[250:32.19]It's not worth it.
[250:32.63]Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[250:33.99]It's not worth it.
[250:34.55]It's not worth it.
[250:34.95]It's not worth it.
[251:09.81]Give me your gun.
[251:10.26]Give me your gun.
[251:10.62]I want ammo.
[251:23.25]Shit.
[251:23.61]Guy right here.
[251:26.65]Oh, okay.
[251:27.21]We're safe.
[251:33.32]Spikes on there.
[251:33.90]I can't jump over that.
[251:34.56]I thought it was a jump.
[251:57.67]Break.
[252:04.48]Cool.
[252:04.60]All right.
[252:04.98]So far so good.
[252:10.41]No contact with the fellas on the roof.
[252:12.11]Feels like we lost him.
[252:14.91]All joke, no.
[252:15.63]I don't think you can fall off, even if you tried.
[252:34.38]Try, try, try.
[252:35.30]I can't.
[252:35.76]I can't even fall down.
[252:44.38]No matter how far we've fallen, we can find redemption in death.
[252:48.40]This is just going on now.
[252:49.34]Okay.
[252:49.70]Now, William, he was a sinner, yes.
[252:53.30]But he was also a loving son.
[252:56.84]A protective brother.
[252:58.42]And a loyal friend.
[253:00.10]And for those virtues...
[253:02.81]We pray that his soul will find salvation.
[253:07.39]And now I believe one of Billy's closest and dearest friends would like to say a few words.
[253:13.42]Oilers from Mafia.
[253:17.16]You're here right now.
[253:20.12]In real time.
[253:21.60]Watching it.
[253:23.64]Billy, I never said this, but I consider you my brother.
[253:32.51]I can't even count all the times you saved my ass from a bee.
[253:35.47]So, I don't know how I'm gonna- Wait!
[253:41.35]That's the guy!
[253:42.55]That's the guy who killed Billy!
[253:43.65]No, uh- A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-
[254:08.04]Johnny, that's Johnny over there.
[254:18.40]Alright, got him.
[254:26.59]Give me that.
[254:27.37]Wait, pocket revolver.
[254:28.61]That sounds cool.
[254:30.21]No, that thing sucks.
[254:30.97]I think I threw a molotov in a church.
[254:37.05]Yeah.
[254:39.45]Yeah, he did.
[254:40.05]I'm sorry.
[254:54.08]I'm sorry.
[254:54.58]Everybody was doing it.
[254:55.70]So I thought I would do it too.
[254:57.78]Everyone was doing it.
[254:59.80]I'm just such a creature of being able to be easily visually manipulated.
[255:25.61]Playing a game with a controller without any aim assist on.
[255:29.07]That's another issue, I think.
[255:30.45]Damn, I'm just realizing that right now.
[255:49.43]Take care of this guy first.
[255:52.45]That was sick.
[255:53.80]Warming him up?
[255:55.58]Who?
[256:00.54]Oh, he's right there.
[256:10.07]Why did the game just slow-mo for that guy?
[256:14.04]See, I told you he's doing it.
[256:15.28]Look it.
[256:15.56]I have enough bullets.
[256:19.79]What's going on?
[256:23.21]Is my computer overheating?
[256:49.77]The shotgun was on the ground!
[257:01.60]He punched me over the thing twice and I got stunlocked.
[257:04.50]Get over here now!
[257:29.27]Who's next?
[257:45.70]Come on.
[257:47.40]Yeah, cool.
[257:47.98]Did I just Fortnite that guy?
[257:59.91]I think I got him.
[258:00.77]Is that him?
[258:12.74]What's with the gun, man?
[258:25.99]You could have stopped all this days ago.
[258:32.15]Over here, right?
[258:38.11]There he is.
[258:38.41]Okay, let's go.
[258:40.31]The vault on keyboard.
[258:45.01]Hand grenade.
[258:52.66]Holy hand grenade.
[258:53.44]What?
[258:57.82]Not yet.
[258:58.12]Not yet.
[258:58.42]Not yet.
[258:58.66]Give me this.
[258:58.96]This is the way this city works.
[259:06.22]It's out of ammo?
[259:06.72]I don't know how to punch!
[259:14.93]I don't know how to punch!
[259:15.51]How do you punch?
[259:17.35]I don't- I don't know how to punch on the fucking keyboard!
[259:19.51]I'm swapping between the two.
[259:22.29]Is left alt?
[259:35.50]Stop reloading, you're wasting your ammo.
[260:12.23]oh my god that guy got shot like seven times you could have stopped all this days ago you did not get that off you I can't believe you got it
[260:49.36]happen I'm sorry it is this is the way this city works
[261:18.61]Oh, there's a machine gun right here.
[261:20.53]Give me that thing.
[261:28.80]Where is he?
[261:49.69]You think I'm enjoying this?
[261:58.76]What have you done?
[262:01.00]Murder in the house of God?
[262:04.24]These men were criminals, father.
[262:07.84]Thieves.
[262:09.84]Rapists.
[262:11.56]Killers.
[262:13.28]And God would have embraced them if they'd asked for forgiveness.
[262:16.46]That's hard.
[262:17.26]Now, which one of these men might have sought redemption by working with the poor?
[262:21.90]Which one might have saved just one life?
[262:24.46]None of us, Father.
[262:28.06]You bastard.
[262:29.39]Wait, didn't... If you have any confessions to make, you better do it quick.
[262:33.75]No more bloodshed, please!
[262:35.35]I'm gonna just fill him with, like, eight rounds of... I shot him with a shin gun, didn't I?
[262:40.19]Consider this an act of...
[262:42.36]divine retribution.
[262:51.82]That make us even?
[262:55.01]Sure.
[262:56.97]For now.
[263:03.27]For your trouble, father.
[263:04.27]Still alive?
[263:05.98]I don't want your blood money.
[263:08.96]You took theirs.
[263:11.94]Not a lot of difference from where I'm standing.
[263:16.64]That should be enough dough to patch up the bullet holes and keep you quiet.
[263:23.33]When the cops come, you tell them the gunman who did this had East Coast accents.
[263:30.77]Are we really doing this to a priest?
[263:34.85]Right?
[263:36.92]I won't lie.
[263:40.44]But I won't say anything at all.
[263:42.37]Good.
[263:44.65]Be a shame if we had to come back here.
[263:46.47]Wait, you got an ammo gun and a priest?
[263:49.61]Where the hell were you?
[263:50.77]As soon as I walked in the church, the crew recognized me.
[263:54.05]Followed me straight back out.
[263:55.61]Holy shit, man.
[263:56.85]Same place as all these guys.
[263:59.16]Come on.
[264:00.06]We gotta go.
[264:06.78]Ammo.
[264:08.42]Oh.
[264:16.07]my spot I'm not sure I'm just where's the car where's the car
[264:41.38]I gotta get in the car.
[264:42.32]Oh, shit.
[264:42.94]Okay, it's alright.
[264:51.95]Stay here.
[264:53.01]Get over here and don't move.
[265:26.17]NONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONON
[265:59.90]No, that's illegal.
[266:09.40]Get in.
[266:13.59]Oh, there's a million police right there.
[266:15.05]We did that real close.
[266:23.87]Returning to the scene of the crime.
[266:30.31]Yes, there was a stolen car.
[266:31.93]You're right.
[266:32.33]Well, today didn't turn out like I expected.
[266:35.41]Oh.
[266:35.97]Do they know it's me?
[266:41.65]I don't think they know it's me.
[266:51.57]Whatever you did at the cat house got the cops plenty pissed.
[266:54.66]Yeah, it was messy, but I got everything done.
[266:58.12]Everything?
[266:59.04]Yeah.
[267:00.91]Right into the car.
[267:05.68]Right into the train.
[267:09.08]Shit.
[267:10.50]I want a bike so bad.
[267:11.42]Can we both ride the bike at the same time?
[267:13.48]Move.
[267:31.52]I'm doing it!
[267:35.10]Alright, get out of the car up here.
[267:40.61]Into the park.
[267:44.11]Get out, get out.
[267:44.57]Run, run.
[267:45.07]Quick, quick, quick.
[267:45.67]Get this way.
[267:46.07]Over here.
[268:10.97]He's behind the newspaper!
[268:12.71]No, I can't- I can't just punch people!
[268:24.73]I already punched my quota of ladies in the face today, okay?
[268:30.33]I'm not adding to it.
[268:32.13]I want a motorcycle though.
[268:44.78]He has a quota.
[268:45.58]No, I'm just saying, I just don't want to go, all right, let's punch this person.
[268:48.02]Let's punch this lady.
[268:48.94]Let's punch this guy.
[269:01.24]Is he a bike?
[269:08.46]I've never seen anyone do the mission like this.
[269:10.70]Did he shoot someone?
[269:11.54]Alright, come here.
[269:29.95]It can't be reported stolen if nobody knows it was stolen.
[269:32.15]Alright.
[269:44.26]We're in the clear.
[269:55.56]Bike, bike, bike.
[269:56.66]It's alright.
[269:57.13]It's okay.
[269:59.82]If you see another one, let me know though.
[270:11.97]Out.
[270:12.09]Can you get on?
[270:33.48]Oh, he can't.
[270:37.93]Oh my god, Sam.
[270:39.25]Please hurry up.
[270:42.03]That's annoying.
[270:42.95]Really?
[270:47.19]You can't get on the bike.
[270:48.17]Pain in the ass.
[270:56.70]You think we're cute?
[270:59.02]Uh, yeah, sure.
[271:17.35]We got no police on us.
[271:18.21]We're good to go.
[271:20.15]Let's go straight on.
[271:27.82]It's time for a pee break, by the way.
[271:30.20]I'm going to get some water too.
[271:32.38]And think about all the crimes I've committed in this game.
[271:36.83]Thanks again, Sam, for helping me out back there.
[271:39.57]I thought my time was up.
[271:41.11]It's not anything you wouldn't do for me.
[271:43.39]I know.
[271:43.85]Update the driver?
[271:44.49]I don't think it's even necessary anymore.
[271:46.05]It's something.
[271:47.99]Don't need to tell me about that.
[271:49.87]Just don't think about it.
[271:51.49]Best lesson I could ever teach you.
[271:54.18]Don't think about anything.
[271:57.26]Ever since I turned up the graphics, it's been fine.
[271:58.82]Alright, let me get some water.
[272:03.84]I'll be back.
[272:06.91]After this cutscene.
[272:07.63]In a fit of paranoid rage, I thought this lady was going to poison me.
[272:09.83]She just wanted to show me where her friend Michelle was, and I punched her in the face eight times.
[272:14.71]You know what?
[272:15.25]Let's bring the whole pot.
[272:39.34]All right, we've come this far together.
[272:41.12]What kind of heat did you get from the church?
[272:44.38]It's a strange thing.
[272:45.69]Nothing really came of it all.
[272:47.41]I always figured Celeri paid off someone somewhere because it wasn't even in her papers.
[272:54.33]Which store can you find this game?
[272:56.59]Thanks.
[272:56.91]Uh, Walmart.
[272:57.33]Target.
[272:57.91]Amazon.
[273:09.93]Did anybody in the 30s eat food?
[273:11.43]We haven't seen anybody eat any food.
[273:13.11]We've seen them drink a shitload of coffee and cigarettes.
[273:34.68]No one's eating.
[273:35.10]They literally just ordered their food.
[273:36.96]They're not gonna eat it on camera though.
[274:01.49]Coletti, Don's consigliere.
[274:03.97]Yeah, that's right.
[274:05.73]He set me straight.
[274:08.71]He set us all straight.
[274:12.03]There's a lot of buzz around town about you guys.
[274:14.75]Yeah, we got into a little scrap last night.
[274:16.60]It's no big deal.
[274:18.26]I don't care about the bar fight, Tom.
[274:20.84]I care how it looks when you walk into a club and buy everyone a round.
[274:24.84]We got to do something with our dough.
[274:27.00]Then blow it at the track on Sunday.
[274:28.68]All right, food recommendation time.
[274:30.94]Or invest it for Christ's sake.
[274:33.54]You want me to become one of those Wall Street boys?
[274:35.26]Don't sass me, Tommy.
[274:38.09]I'm trying to teach you the ropes so you don't get strangled by them.
[274:43.75]You have a dog, Tom.
[274:45.24]stonks sure a little mud when I was a kid I don't think I can eat those when I was eight or nine before I came over from the cecily I had this beautiful skinny cherneco de letna like a little greyhound fastest dog you've ever seen that's how I met the dawn he started setting up races together betting on her with coins and rifle shells
[275:10.77]there wasn't another dog that could catch her.
[275:13.97]She never lost.
[275:17.35]Until the day she did.
[275:20.97]We were only out of pocketknife, but I never saw the dawn so angry.
[275:26.52]She got old on you?
[275:27.94]No.
[275:29.22]Pregnant.
[275:30.78]She went into heat, got out of the yard, and every dog in town had a turn.
[275:38.34]You're like that dog, Tommy.
[275:41.34]Every time you flash your money around, you're a bitch in heat.
[275:44.50]And everyone in that club is now looking to fuck you.
[275:47.00]I think there's a different way you could describe this to me.
[275:52.35]You're no good to us.
[275:53.43]What the hell are you doing?
[275:56.97]Do you understand?
[276:00.69]You made your point.
[276:02.44]Good.
[276:04.14]Because you need to think about your career here.
[276:08.19]Look, Paulie's hit his ceiling.
[276:10.21]It's a germateer analogy.
[276:11.81]He's not smart enough to run anything.
[276:14.26]Sam is loyal, but he has no vision.
[276:17.22]But you, Tommy.
[276:20.28]You could run this town someday.
[276:21.86]Uh.
[276:23.16]Well, I appreciate that.
[276:26.78]Considerably more hateful than mine.
[276:29.65]So, uh.
[276:33.00]So tell me, you're like Saturn.
[276:35.40]Out in the atmosphere.
[276:36.84]And me, I'm like Jupiter.
[276:38.32]And the dawn, the dawn is like the galaxy.
[276:43.15]You've got to be careful you don't go too many revolutions around that sun.
[276:46.09]That would be kind of, yeah, I could see that.
[276:49.41]That's kind of what I would do.
[276:53.45]Jeremy, you just missed the moral of the whole story.
[277:04.01]um don't show don't flash around your money and don't act like an I think that's pretty much the whole story right back then everything went through frank the plans the orders the money you could get the call day or night ah tom frank says to wait for him in the garage out in the back
[277:32.20]You got the job, I think.
[277:33.90]Thanks, Luigi.
[277:35.92]Sarah's cooking.
[277:36.80]She's bringing something over.
[277:37.76]Don't put the game on easy.
[277:40.18]She's a good girl.
[277:42.02]Pretty good moral of the story, I think.
[277:43.58]Alright, where's Frank?
[277:52.27]Sure.
[277:53.75]Back in the day, when the boss was still with that phone, we got called out for a hit.
[278:04.01]Got to pee?
[278:04.67]Oh, right.
[278:05.21]It's alright.
[278:07.09]Oh, this has been kind of one big, long cutscene.
[278:15.50]Thanks for waiting, Tom.
[278:17.06]But Don and I had to go over last month's numbers again.
[278:19.88]Sure.
[278:20.66]So what's the job?
[278:22.02]I want you to help Sam and Paulie with the shipment we've got coming in tonight.
[278:26.11]Good stuff.
[278:26.87]Straight from Canada.
[278:28.93]Where do you need me?
[278:30.03]Sam's gone to meet our friends from the north at the farm outside of town.
[278:33.88]Paulie will oversee the trucks bringing the shipment into the city.
[278:36.82]But I want you to go with him.
[278:39.84]Oh, shit.
[278:40.14]This isn't an open world game.
[278:41.50]Make sure it all goes smoothly.
[278:43.50]Okay.
[278:44.69]Get the car from Ralphie.
[278:46.09]Meet Paulie at the warehouse.
[278:47.83]How does it feel like it is?
[278:48.79]Sure, Frank.
[278:49.37]No problem.
[278:49.91]Good.
[278:53.64]Now bring the Canadian home safe, Tommy.
[278:57.06]There is already a case you remarked for the done.
[278:59.48]You can do free roaming?
[279:10.59]All right, let's go.
[279:11.81]All right, it's not, let's pee.
[279:12.57]We'll be back in like two minutes.
[279:14.71]Beer pee?
[281:36.30]OK, hello.
[281:45.69]Motor's yours if you want it, Tommy.
[281:48.55]Thanks.
[281:48.87]I want it.
[281:50.95]Welcome back.
[281:55.34]Sorry, I was looking at chat.
[281:59.16]Drive to Salieri's warehouse.
[282:01.35]Alright, let's move on.
[282:02.65]Drivers?
[282:02.95]I don't need them.
[282:04.39]I'm good.
[282:04.75]I need to make a turn here.
[282:31.39]Holy shit, I am intact.
[282:33.25]Cool!
[282:50.83]I'm not gonna lead the cops to the job.
[282:52.17]There's a guy on foot chasing me.
[282:55.75]That's it.
[282:56.03]I'm gonna be fine.
[283:01.99]Through here.
[283:04.22]Let's drive.
[283:08.18]Yeah, I'm going.
[283:13.48]Shit, that's a lot of noise.
[283:14.55]Okay.
[283:24.47]Just hang out for a sec.
[283:27.46]Drive slowly to the next checkpoint.
[283:29.26]We're good to go.
[283:34.66]Hop right in front of me.
[283:42.32]Alright, we're good.
[283:43.96]I want to drive a motorcycle around.
[283:58.70]Ask and you shall receive.
[284:09.58]He hates the game.
[284:10.60]Where are you getting that idea?
[284:13.48]Alright, now this is very slippery, but it's pretty cool.
[284:22.63]Can I do wheelie?
[284:26.11]I can ride like Batman.
[284:27.13]That's cool.
[284:32.33]And three, two, one.
[284:35.29]Fly over the handlebars.
[284:48.41]Oh no, it's the concussion sound again.
[284:50.21]Fuck you!
[284:58.65]Can't jump over that.
[285:23.14]Can you see me?
[285:26.56]Okay, now what?
[285:33.03]Are you going to arrest me?
[285:38.14]He's looking for me.
[285:55.43]Wait, he... Why was that sound?
[286:15.86]I heard a vooga, and then it shot- it exploded.
[286:24.97]Okay, which way do I need to go?
[286:26.48]Back to the bike.
[286:27.22]The bike is right here.
[286:45.46]Why did I do that?
[286:51.47]I don't- because I was driving too fast on the motorcycle and I crashed into somebody and the guy chased me into the bush and then I got shot by five cops.
[287:10.88]Actually, okay, I'm not fucking around.
[287:13.40]Get me, get me the fuck out of this.
[287:15.44]Who cares about the bike?
[287:16.14]The bike is stupid.
[287:16.86]You just crash and die.
[287:18.15]The motorcycle doesn't go faster or anything.
[287:26.43]It's just more vulnerable.
[287:28.89]Okay.
[287:41.50]But it looks cool.
[287:42.32]It does.
[287:42.62]You're right.
[287:42.90]Okay.
[287:43.08]And back to fast.
[287:43.64]Okay.
[288:33.75]We're good.
[288:46.00]Somebody said, look at that link.
[288:47.30]Hold on.
[288:47.62]Is that the water doing that or is it me being an idiot?
[288:58.51]Pops.
[289:03.07]What's... Why is everybody standing over here?
[289:08.69]Dangerous driving on Central Island.
[289:11.09]Oh, what?
[289:11.51]Because I looked back at the car accident?
[289:14.33]What?
[289:14.63]Pursue an arrest.
[289:17.19]Bring him in.
[289:22.09]You nearly hit a guy.
[289:23.27]I did not.
[289:23.93]Officer's on Central Island.
[289:28.93]Suspect has been lost.
[289:30.16]Keep patrolling.
[289:33.42]We're safe down here.
[289:33.88]Okay, we're good.
[289:54.67]Uh... He's coming back this way.
[290:07.17]Oh shit, it's this dock.
[290:09.17]I gotta go over the bridge.
[290:19.15]No!
[290:19.49]Did I just get the cops called on me again?
[290:21.77]Because I fucking beeped at her.
[290:40.18]Just take the ticket or no.
[290:42.26]Yeah, I mean, there's no in-game currency.
[290:44.34]That doesn't really do anything.
[290:46.74]It's not a problem.
[290:47.54]It's not like it takes money out of your account in the game.
[290:50.67]Alright, I'll just go turn myself in right here, right?
[290:54.49]There's like three cops here.
[290:55.37]Here.
[290:55.95]I will pay.
[290:56.47]I will pay.
[290:58.99]I will pay.
[291:09.22]I'm paying my Skyrim debt.
[291:13.06]What just happened?
[291:13.64]Mm-hmm.
[291:14.08]Okay.
[291:15.88]We're good.
[291:43.17]Don't tell me I could get you in trouble for that.
[291:51.27]Oh, and, uh, officers, excuse me.
[291:53.01]Were you just beeping at a pedestrian in the crosswalk?
[291:56.84]I was crossing the road and you beeped at me.
[291:59.74]I thought you... Both, arrest yourselves.
[292:07.70]Was I a pedestrian in the road and did you beep at me and scare me?
[292:14.93]Why are they speed matching me?
[292:16.05]I don't like this.
[292:57.85]Oh, I can't play these games.
[292:59.61]Like, I just can't.
[293:00.64]My attention is so bad.
[293:02.60]Like, I look at chat and just read what you guys are saying.
[293:05.62]Come on, straight away.
[293:06.52]It's just like, I'm just, I'm looking over and just, oh, hey, hi guys.
[293:09.52]Oh, fucking God.
[293:12.52]Just get there for the love of God.
[293:23.40]Holy shit, man.
[293:28.83]Okay.
[293:29.45]It's not Grand Theft Auto.
[293:35.13]It's not GTA.
[293:37.03]Stop playing the game like it's GTA.
[293:41.26]You can't just like smash into stuff and just drive over people and drive into things.
[293:46.70]There are rules.
[293:47.34]There are laws in this game.
[293:48.64]Lighting is pretty good.
[293:54.44]Yeah, it is.
[293:56.15]I mean, the game looks great.
[293:57.19]It really does.
[293:57.83]It really does.
[294:17.09]Ride the bank.
[294:17.99]Okay, here we are.
[294:18.87]Same exact spot.
[294:41.46]Graphics are pretty good for the 1930s.
[294:44.00]Yeah, they are.
[295:08.44]This game is ridiculous.
[295:10.52]Illegal speeder?
[295:43.31]Sharing the road with this thing would be so hard.
[295:48.86]I'm glad I don't live in a city that has one of those.
[295:50.42]That would freak me out.
[295:51.66]Normal driving RP or Riot, fine.
[296:08.03]Rainy out today.
[296:10.07]Thought it was gonna break.
[296:34.83]I thought I was gonna crash through it.
[296:37.38]Joke ruined.
[296:38.02]Oh well.
[296:57.08]How far away is this place?
[296:58.12]This place is across the whole game.
[297:11.85]Alright, take off the limiter.
[297:14.43]Overclock the car, please.
[297:15.95]Alright, now it's back on.
[297:32.31]When you get a straightaway like that,
[297:35.37]You gotta go for it.
[297:36.31]If there's no cops around, you're fine.
[297:42.43]In front of that car, it looked like it was made out of tin foil.
[297:44.17]Come on, Tom!
[297:50.00]Hey, hey!
[297:51.48]Watch it, pal.
[297:52.62]Just try it out.
[297:54.70]Sorry.
[297:56.82]You know this place?
[297:57.92]Ah, yeah.
[297:59.30]We've done a few pickups at the farm before.
[298:01.19]Don't worry.
[298:03.23]There ain't nothing but cow shit and shine out here.
[298:07.21]It's gonna be an easy few clams.
[298:08.69]Boys will load up the trucks, and we'll come straight back.
[298:13.47]Yeah, let's make it quick.
[298:14.75]I got someplace to be.
[298:16.56]The skin is really good in this game.
[298:19.50]You can see like all the random little splotchies.
[298:24.39]How do you even do that?
[298:29.65]How do you do next day after a shave look?
[298:32.37]It's crazy.
[298:33.37]I'm just kidding.
[298:35.17]She's a good girl.
[298:37.21]You settle down, she'll straighten you right out.
[298:43.98]You're going home to a couch.
[298:45.83]Yeah, the bumps.
[298:46.41]The bumps look really good.
[298:48.43]I wonder what kind of story she could tell about her old man, though.
[298:51.29]Luigi was a stone cold killer back in the day.
[298:54.89]Where are we driving?
[298:56.00]Are we driving off the road?
[298:57.82]Where are we?
[298:58.34]Look outside.
[299:00.16]You know she's been helping out behind the bar since she was a kid.
[299:03.12]We're driving underwater?
[299:04.42]I bet she's seen and heard a few things.
[299:08.58]Probably knows more about our business than we do.
[299:11.52]She knows enough.
[299:12.34]Where's this car?
[299:12.84]I don't have any questions.
[299:15.53]Watching a movie would be hell with you.
[299:18.67]No, no, I put tape over my mouth.
[299:23.80]The only thing you hear is...
[299:50.28]So if you turn the volume up loud enough to like maybe 7 or 8 on your TV, you won't even hear that.
[299:55.54]He ain't coming.
[299:57.00]Okay.
[299:59.36]Let's go find him.
[300:03.96]That bastard is just three sheets and I'm wrecking a new suit for nothing.
[300:10.32]I swear I'm gonna kill him.
[300:13.31]Here.
[300:15.01]Just in case Frank was right.
[300:18.40]I'm gonna go grab them boys.
[300:20.00]Get them sorted out.
[300:21.56]You go ahead and see what's what.
[300:22.84]We'll catch up with you.
[300:24.46]Shotgun.
[300:33.35]Search for clues.
[300:39.65]So the last mission was Hitman.
[300:40.95]Now this is like a detective game.
[300:42.96]This game is everything, huh?
[300:46.38]One quarter out of work.
[300:50.60]Find Sam.
[300:55.86]I'd be sneaking around.
[300:56.84]Somebody here.
[300:57.58]What is this?
[300:58.10]A little target.
[300:58.78]Oh.
[300:59.48]Arlo Falcone.
[301:19.83]Oh, it's a collectible card.
[301:20.67]Okay, cool.
[301:26.51]Investigate the truck.
[301:27.75]What are they in there?
[301:33.76]Are they sleeping?
[301:42.96]He's dead.
[301:49.20]Alright, well he got one for me.
[301:52.86]I didn't even have to aim.
[301:54.36]I'm glad.
[301:55.06]Okay.
[302:27.57]I shot the two glass bottles more than I could shoot the guy.
[302:31.84]I'm getting collapsed on.
[302:46.35]Oh, come on.
[302:47.07]I shot him three times.
[302:48.09]Right in the chest.
[302:49.05]Time to put up the keyboard.
[302:56.14]Alright, keyboard time.
[303:21.74]Keyboard mode, yep.
[303:24.24]Doesn't really help, no does it?
[303:43.80]Crap.
[303:49.87]Is there ammo in here?
[303:51.37]Yes, there is.
[303:52.19]Uh, meet at the usual place, whatever that means.
[304:03.38]It's a Wiimote?
[304:04.86]Use a Wiimote.
[304:06.10]You know, I wish I could.
[304:07.20]When I play games, sometimes I go, damn, this would be so much better with a Wiimote.
[304:18.54]Use a VR headset?
[304:21.19]Hey, glad you brought that up.
[304:22.89]Tomorrow, going back to VR.
[304:24.41]Gonna play multiplayer VR with some friends.
[304:30.91]Oh, Christ.
[304:50.35]Yeah, I leaked it already, but I'm not going to leak it anymore.
[304:55.67]That's not going to happen until late tomorrow night.
[305:01.35]Very late.
[305:02.07]8 p.m.
[305:05.82]Pacific is when that stream is.
[305:06.82]It's going to be a late one tomorrow.
[305:08.56]Okay.
[305:33.03]Alright, let's go find Sam.
[305:34.09]How much ammo?
[305:36.11]Nah, I'll keep the shotgun.
[305:37.73]Any more ammo though?
[305:38.51]I want a bunch of ammo for the shotgun.
[305:43.43]Here we go.
[305:44.08]Okay, now I feel confident.
[306:02.62]East Coast?
[306:03.00]Yeah, that's going to be 11pm start East Coast.
[306:05.02]It's late.
[306:07.80]The latest stream I've done in probably a year or two.
[306:13.04]Could be a lot of fun though.
[306:16.39]And that starts the beginning of a lot of VR.
[306:21.57]FTK obviously is going to be this weekend.
[306:24.25]And tomorrow, I'm going to start the stream a little early tomorrow.
[306:29.10]Just so I can get VR set up and we're going to talk about FTK.
[306:34.50]Yes, a little bit.
[306:35.22]Maybe like before maybe 20 minutes before everyone kind of shows up.
[306:38.10]Where the hell are you?
[306:39.39]You want to quiet down, Polly?
[306:40.57]Because that's happening this weekend.
[306:48.85]All the tobs over here for what?
[306:50.15]Tommy, you don't want to see this.
[306:53.07]Jesus.
[306:55.15]Oh, shit.
[306:55.61]What the hell is this?
[306:56.17]Looks like we found the Canadians.
[306:58.00]You see salmon there?
[307:00.40]No.
[307:02.12]That's something.
[307:05.63]End of the stream voice?
[307:06.71]Yeah, probably.
[307:11.48]Yeah, probably.
[307:12.48]It's gonna be that point.
[307:17.62]I'll be back tomorrow, though.
[307:19.71]Tomorrow's gonna be high energy.
[307:21.63]It's gonna be in VR.
[307:22.41]Is that a bad guy?
[307:25.11]Oh, no.
[307:29.62]Today was pretty high energy too.
[307:30.84]The last few streams have been pretty high energy.
[307:32.60]High energy?
[307:34.60]Why can I not say that together?
[307:42.32]Pretty much always high energy.
[307:43.50]The only time I'm not high energy... I think we found him.
[307:52.37]Alright, we got him.
[307:53.61]We found the bad guys.
[308:00.88]Throw a Molotov in here?
[308:02.04]Alright, I'm going to throw a Molotov in there.
[308:04.00]There's nobody in here.
[308:10.44]Alright, I got the back.
[308:16.61]Ooh.
[308:27.73]He's never gonna finish this game?
[308:29.11]Um, I don't know.
[308:31.61]I might.
[308:33.25]Once VR is set up, it's not being teared down for a while.
[308:36.49]I've got like a dozen VR games I have to play while that's set up.

[325:33.95]That guy dead?
[325:34.57]Is this car driving itself?
[326:04.68]Uh, here comes the armored truck.
[326:09.72]I think that was just a guy on a motorcycle.
[326:10.94]I don't think that was even a cop.
[326:14.37]Tesla?
[326:20.35]Tesla car?

[326:37.16]I don't know why I just read this.
[326:43.32]I thought somebody just said centrist truck.
[326:48.77]Like, what?
[326:49.43]What does that even mean?
[327:10.93]Get the driver.
[327:20.08]Driver, driver, get the driver.
[327:23.80]What?
[327:51.92]Okay, it's already- the truck's already dead!
[327:53.61]You died to centrist wheel.
[328:15.83]Um, where are they?
[328:25.63]One down.
[328:26.41]There's one down.
[328:28.21]The truck is about to explode.
[328:31.65]Nope, we're good.
[328:42.19]Going in the clear?
[328:55.73]More.
[328:57.87]That guy thinks he's He-Man right now.
[329:11.68]That cop couldn't even believe it himself.
[329:20.15]Am I softlocked?
[329:22.23]No.
[329:42.28]Come on.
[329:44.27]Did I not kill the guy behind there?
[329:50.38]He's still there.
[329:50.94]I think we're good.
[330:15.35]No.
[330:18.05]Apparently not.
[330:18.76]There's another one.
[330:24.98]Okay, armor truck versus bread van.
[330:32.83]I wonder which one's gonna win.
[330:34.03]Dude, it's tires.
[330:54.09]Shoot the gun.
[330:57.75]It wants me to shoot the gun.
[330:59.15]I kind of sound like Barry from American Dad.
[331:12.98]Steve's friend.
[331:25.35]Holy shit.
[331:31.80]Okay.
[331:34.12]Just duck.
[331:34.96]When they reload, shoot it a little bit.
[331:36.18]Duck, shoot it a little bit.
[331:37.46]Duck, shoot it a little bit.
[331:38.42]In the gun.
[331:39.16]I know, I know.
[331:39.76]Did I get it?
[331:59.98]Shoot the gun.
[332:01.12]I know!
[332:31.52]God.
[332:31.96]Take out the what?
[332:33.80]The windshield?
[332:42.36]Oh my god, this is gonna be so hard to shoot the lights out.
[332:44.72]Did I get it?
[332:50.94]Yes.
[332:51.82]Tommy, take out the trash.
[332:58.38]The trash?
[332:59.68]Why are you saying it like that?
[333:10.03]I just dropped him.
[333:11.27]I'm playing like Plinko on The Price is Right.
[333:14.33]I'm not even aiming.
[333:19.19]We did it.
[333:20.73]We did it.
[333:28.69]This mission is really long.
[333:30.17]Holy shit.
[333:35.36]Okay, we're here, Tom.
[333:36.40]You get Sam out, I'm gonna go wake up the Doc.
[333:43.48]I feel like this guy would be dead by now.
[334:06.19]Pauly?
[334:07.19]What the hell are you doing here so late?
[334:10.41]Evening, Doc.
[334:11.73]Sorry to wake you, but we have a little accident.
[334:15.32]Oilipol Gaming, five community subs.

[334:18.98]Okay, thank you.
[334:21.90]Okay.
[334:23.38]Stay with Sam.
[334:24.16]That's a pretty cool name.
[334:25.63]You can take the truck back.
[334:27.29]Call it a night.
[334:27.93]No, I'll wait.
[334:28.55]All right.
[334:35.14]I like that name.
[334:36.02]I really do.
[334:37.67]You didn't.
[334:38.41]I did everything.
[335:08.89]I want like five grand.
[335:12.79]Or I'm walking.
[335:16.91]That was a five grand kind of play there.
[335:22.53]All right.
[335:25.41]That is where I'm going to end the stream tonight.
[335:27.67]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[335:30.92]I will see you tomorrow for VR.
[335:32.10]I think that's a good stopping point.
[335:38.24]Sorry I put it on easy.
[335:39.06]Sorry I punched that lady.
[335:40.00]Sorry I shot that guy.
[335:41.22]Sorry I strangled that guy.
[335:42.32]Sorry I strangled the other guy.
[335:43.33]Sorry I shot that other guy.
[335:44.27]Sorry I ran that whole bunch of people over.
[335:47.47]Please forgive me.
[335:51.89]Actually kind of a big map.
[335:55.75]No, not forgiven.
[335:58.39]I also blew up the clown too.
[335:59.89]Oh, I didn't actually do that.
[336:01.13]I think he was still alive.
[336:06.76]Thank you, everybody.
[336:07.36]We'll see you soon.

[336:11.64]I'm going to be playing VR.
[336:13.64]I'm going to be setting it up and doing that all over again.
[336:16.92]Half-Life Alyx will be shortly after that.
[336:21.07]Probably next week.
[336:31.55]And after that...
[336:33.85]Maybe I will come back.
[336:34.63]There's probably another six to seven hours left in the game.
[336:37.41]Maybe one more full stream of this game.
[336:39.21]Maybe.
[336:40.59]It depends.
[336:44.35]I'm looking forward to Half-Life, Alex.
[336:47.28]It'll be a lot of fun.
[336:48.34]But thank you, everybody.
[336:48.96]Thanks to all the subs.
[336:49.56]There was a lot of gifted subs today.
[336:50.86]A couple of huge raids, too.

[337:43.30]Yeah, critical is online, right?
[337:45.14]What's critical doing?
[337:56.18]Raid the debate?
[337:57.46]I'm not gonna raid the debate.
[337:58.78]That's... That's a mistake.
[338:06.56]What's, uh, what's Critical doing right now?
[338:10.75]Oh, shit.
