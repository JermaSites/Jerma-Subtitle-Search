[01:18.08]Yeah, I just, like, ran my head under the fucking sink.
[01:27.35]Alright.
[01:28.27]There's this one piece of fucking hair right here that I need, like, gel.
[01:31.19]Otherwise, I can't... Nothing... It doesn't do... I can't get it to work.
[01:34.01]It doesn't work with me, you know?
[01:36.49]I can never get it to work.
[01:39.19]But, anyways.
[01:39.96]Okay.
[01:40.32]Let me move this.
[01:49.56]Fucking comb stream.
[01:50.90]You want me to shave too?
[02:00.43]How can I get your red flushed complexion?
[02:02.37]Play Resident Evil 7 for like two hours.
[02:09.50]Alright, let's see.
[02:10.54]Let's get some Q&A questions.
[02:11.84]How about that?
[02:13.84]That sounds like fun.
[02:15.50]Even though this is not even in the right fucking spot.
[02:21.75]I have to turn that off.
[02:25.09]Actually, hold on.
[02:32.08]Because this ain't going to be right.
[02:39.94]Okay.
[02:41.04]I guess it is right.
[02:48.26]Okay.
[02:49.75]Alright, let's just chill and fucking let's... Hey, let me take your fucking questions.
[02:54.29]Let me take your fucking questions.
[02:59.79]Did I always squeeze my butt cheeks together after taking a shower or what?
[03:03.19]Wait, what the fuck are you talking about?
[03:08.72]No.
[03:09.82]I don't squeeze my butt cheek.
[03:11.46]I don't squeeze my butt cheeks together for any reason.
[03:15.88]So my definition of fun?
[03:18.08]This.
[03:20.03]This is pretty fucking fun.
[03:22.55]I have fun doing this.
[03:24.35]This is my definition of what I have for me to be a good time.
[03:30.26]Do I like... Why is Resident Evil still in the background?
[03:32.32]Is it?
[03:33.18]Shouldn't be.
[03:36.20]It should have been gone by now.
[03:43.32]It's not on.
[03:45.20]I don't know.
[03:45.60]Let's try a different hairstyle.
[03:48.69]What do you say?
[03:51.29]Should I go like this way with it?
[03:53.59]I don't know how you guys are, but every time I like wet my hair, it takes, it looks like fucking garbage for like an hour before it looks like okay again.
[04:00.84]Wait, what?
[04:03.44]What the fuck am I doing?
[04:05.62]Why am I doing this?
[04:08.96]Have I run out of shit to do?
[04:11.40]I've run out of shit to do completely.
[04:13.05]I'm sitting here coloring my fucking hair on a live stream.
[04:20.78]I'm sitting here combing my fucking hair on a live stream.
[04:25.92]Are you fucking kidding me?
[04:33.99]Because I have a special boy.
[04:35.43]That's right.
[04:38.25]What was my dream job when I was younger?
[04:39.89]I wanted to be an actor.
[04:42.99]I wanted to be in movies and shit.
[04:48.55]The dawning realization.
[04:56.53]Sounds like a fun stream.
[05:00.77]Clickbait streamer?
[05:01.93]What?
[05:02.37]It just says Q&A fucking comb stream.
[05:04.67]That's not a lie.
[05:06.57]I didn't make it up.
[05:07.77]I'm doing it.
[05:08.31]What would your advice be to be content creators in general?
[05:13.85]Do something you like to do.
[05:16.09]Make something you want to make, not something that you think you have to make.
[05:20.25]Do something you want to do.
[05:24.25]Have you ever had any interest in history?
[05:28.45]Not particularly.
[05:30.25]I mean, I think, yeah, I think it's interesting.
[05:31.61]I think history is, like, important to, you know, for you to learn, but I don't think it's anything that I'm, like, super ultra into.
[05:42.97]There are teeth on combs.
[05:44.23]What size teeth are on your comb?
[05:46.04]I have... You tell me.
[05:49.88]I have no idea.
[05:50.54]It's just like a shitty, like, copper-infused comb from, like, CVS.
[05:55.62]So, I have no fucking idea.
[05:58.28]It could be anything at this point.
[06:04.50]Let's go, like, across like this.
[06:08.12]No, it's just gonna be like a chia pet until it dries.
[06:10.98]It's gonna look like fucking garbage until it, like, dries up.
[06:19.43]Check out War of the Monsters.
[06:20.69]It's an old PS2 game.
[06:21.77]War of the Monsters, huh?
[06:24.19]Maybe I will.
[06:28.61]Have you got thick or thin hair?
[06:29.79]I have very thin hair.
[06:32.16]My hair is like baby hair.
[06:35.80]So, I don't have the thickest hair in the world.
[06:39.42]It's very, very thin.
[06:42.25]Not like bald thin, but thin as in like if you run your hands through it, it's, you know, you don't get like caught.
[06:54.06]John Kerry streamer.
[06:55.24]Yeah, all I need is like white hair and I'm good.
[06:59.04]I'm golden.
[07:02.17]What are my thoughts on Star?
[07:05.79]He's fucking, he's cool.
[07:10.81]How am I reading chat right now?
[07:12.51]It's right in front of me.
[07:13.37]It's right there.
[07:14.31]It's literally right fucking there.
[07:15.91]It's right in front of me.
[07:20.37]Do I want to have kids someday?
[07:22.47]I don't know.
[07:24.59]I don't know.
[07:26.95]I mean, the correct answer is probably, but the real answer is I don't think so.
[07:33.65]I don't know.
[07:34.17]I'm not sure.
[07:38.09]I'll have to find the right lady that I would like to have children with.
[07:42.36]Wait, what?
[07:44.18]And obviously, like, be married, probably.
[07:52.22]What's my favorite food?
[07:52.96]Alright!
[07:57.66]Hold on.
[08:00.46]Somebody just gave big money.
[08:02.60]Somebody just gave big fucking money and I need to find my thing.
[08:05.48]Uh-oh.
[08:10.68]What happened to my notifications tab?
[08:17.77]One second.
[08:18.83]Somebody just gave fucking like a hundred bucks.
[08:29.45]Who the fuck was that?
[08:31.49]Who the fuck just gave that money?
[08:37.35]Okay, alright, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[08:40.76]Frisky Moose, thank you for the hundred bucks.
[08:44.62]Thank you so much, Frisky Moose.
[08:46.16]And they say, since we've devolved to a sit-down and hangout stream, thought I'd let you know how rad of a dude you are, Jerma.
[08:52.61]Keep being amazing, though I think you needn't try to be.
[08:57.76]Well, thank you, Frisky Moose.
[08:59.74]That's fucking incredibly kind of you.
[09:01.99]And that's a lot of money to drop on some random shithead that's just combing his hair on a stream.
[09:11.45]Thank you.
[09:12.05]Thank you so much.
[09:13.93]That's very kind of you, dude.
[09:15.92]And also, Crockettman gave five bucks.
[09:18.92]When was the last time you played Smite with MLC_St3alth or played anything with him in general?
[09:24.21]I mean, we talk from time to time.
[09:26.45]Stealth is obviously busy with all his smite shit.
[09:30.21]That's kind of the way it is with everybody that I talk to online, really.
[09:34.97]Star has his own shit going on with Overwatch.
[09:38.84]Even guys like Boo have their shit going on.
[09:40.54]Etalyx has a bunch of shit going on.
[09:43.26]Stealth has obviously all that shit going on.
[09:46.48]It's just... Yeah, we still talk.
[09:48.86]We still do Twitter DMs and shit like that.
[09:50.88]He's a good dude.
[09:53.48]But thank you, Crockett man.
[09:54.72]Thank you so much for the, uh, what was this?
[09:57.10]I thank you.
[09:57.48]Thank you.
[09:57.70]Thank you so much.
[09:59.60]It's like, I need to show that I have a comb in my hand.
[10:02.58]I think that's like what's going on because I don't want people to come to the stream and be like, the fuck is this guy talking about?
[10:10.29]What the fuck is this guy talking about?
[10:11.59]Alright.
[10:14.33]So, and you comb your hair on stream, but just today,

[28:09.48]Bethesda makes pretty decent games, I guess.
[28:16.18]Are you serious?
[28:17.31]Why?
[28:17.49]Because I don't know who the fucking game designer of the year is?
[28:19.99]I have to pay attention to... I know who fucking John Romero is.
[28:29.25]He's the guy that made Doom.
[28:33.39]I know who John Romero is.
[28:37.15]GUY MADE FUCKING DOOM Just waiting for fucking people to be so fucking mad about that Who's John Romero?

[29:49.24]How does it feel to... Jerma, how does it feel to be the creator of Doom?
[29:54.27]Feels pretty fucking awesome, actually.
[29:57.13]Let me tell you, when we were sitting around that boardroom meeting, talking about what game to create, and I, you know, I just thought of this fucking idea.
[30:03.67]I was like, you know, what if they were just monsters?
[30:06.45]What if there were these big, scary monsters inside of this bunch of rooms?
[30:11.81]And everyone clapped, and I created Doom.
[30:15.09]That's right.
[30:16.06]Y'all thought it was that guy fucking John Carpenter.
[30:18.90]Nope.
[30:19.10]It was me.
[30:21.06]I created Doom.
[30:26.72]I thought the book was supposed to be last summer.
[30:28.00]The book was supposed to come out like fucking three years ago.
[30:31.71]And then I realized how hard it is to write books.
[30:34.37]And fucking gave up for two years.
[30:39.71]Squeaky chair?
[30:40.39]Yeah, this just sucks.

[32:04.94]I'm gonna look like a fucking dickhead.
[32:07.70]No, I can't, it won't go down.
[32:10.12]I'm just making it look, like, stupid.
[32:17.98]Why am I so short?
[32:19.38]Because God doesn't fucking love me.
[32:25.73]I don't know.
[32:27.29]Why?
[32:27.81]Why am I not, like, tall, huh?
[32:29.91]Why, God?
[32:30.91]Why am I not tall?
[32:31.97]You want to see how tall I am?
[32:37.68]Fucking, like... I'm so, like... Let me tell you.
[32:40.04]I'm scared of, like, full-body stream shit.
[32:43.26]Because, honest to God, like, this could get ugly.
[32:45.28]You know what I mean?
[32:46.10]This could get ugly.
[32:47.85]I don't want it to get ugly.

[33:03.51]We ain't doing that.
[33:05.87]No, that's a fucking stupid idea.
[33:07.47]We ain't doing that.
[33:13.73]Somebody just came in and said ugly.
[33:16.87]Somebody came in and said ugly.
[33:20.94]That means I'm doing this wrong.
[33:23.04]This has got to be better looking.
[33:26.68]Somebody came in and said I'm fucking ugly.
[33:28.02]What do I do?
[33:33.92]Five, six?
[33:34.54]I'm not fucking five, six.

[34:04.11]I got done playing Resident Evil 7 and I had no other plans.
[34:07.13]So... I will agree.
[34:09.17]It is fucking stupid.

[42:46.10]You rubbed the fucking lamp.
[42:47.44]You rubbed the lamp and that's what you want to ask the genie?
[42:51.62]Oh great, oh powerful genie, please come out.
[42:53.64]Yes, I'm here.
[42:56.34]What is your wish?
[42:58.08]Beer.
[42:58.68]Do you eat ass?
[43:03.36]course I do and he's sucked back in come some more it's a simple yes or no question no we ain't doing like sexual shit no we're not doing that clip it no I was pretending to be the genie
[43:31.65]I was fucking acting.
[43:33.57]I was acting as the fucking genie.
[43:38.02]It was an act.
[43:38.74]I'm an actor.
[43:39.34]You know what I mean?
[43:39.96]I'm a fucking actor.
[43:42.94]I've honed my craft.
[43:43.90]Fucking somebody already clipped it.
[43:46.78]Somebody already clipped it.
[43:51.91]I was pretending to be the genie.
[43:55.41]The genie eats ass.
[44:02.06]You guys are fucking crazy.
[44:13.16]Why is there foam on my walls?
[44:14.38]Because it's sound paneling.
[44:17.00]So it doesn't have like a huge echo when I talk or say anything at all.
[44:25.69]What is this person saying?
[44:26.67]Hey, thank you 26758 for the sub.
[44:35.03]Has that children's book coming?
[44:36.39]I'm not writing a children's book.
[44:39.62]No soup for you.
[44:40.40]Read your damn bit donations.
[44:41.56]You've missed some.
[44:42.86]I fucking have.
[44:44.46]You're right.
[44:48.62]MooMeansMoo with five bucks says, Hello again, Jerma.
[44:51.32]Question time.
[44:51.84]I was wondering how you stay creative.
[44:53.26]I used to really enjoy drawing and making music, but I've been feeling really rutted lately.
[44:57.44]Any advice for getting out of a creative rut?
[45:00.20]Yes.
[45:01.48]Yes.
[45:02.60]Do something that you've never done before.
[45:08.74]If you draw or you make music, make, do a genre that you've never done before or do something that you just have never done creatively before.
[45:19.68]And that should help a lot.
[45:21.54]Because if you keep doing the same thing over and over again, you'll end up staying in that rut because you have no, you have like nothing else to try besides the one thing that you're like focusing on that you're in the rut for.
[45:33.85]So do something completely fucking different that you've never done before.
[45:39.76]Eat ass.
[45:40.62]No!
[45:41.44]That's not what I'm fucking saying!
[45:44.78]That's not what I'm saying.
[45:46.41]You guys are putting words in here.
[45:50.27]In here.
[45:53.91]Skydive with a painting.
[45:55.09]Wait, what?
[45:57.19]Well, thank you, Moomins.
[45:58.15]That's very nice of you.
[45:59.29]Thanks for the five bucks.
[46:03.85]Uh, what did I miss?
[46:06.99]Thank you Garrosh Hexscreen for the 200 bits.
[46:09.05]They say, when are we getting a video on Digg's Nightcrawler?
[46:12.87]The last Wonderbook game.
[46:14.45]I already recorded it like a year ago.
[46:16.98]Just over a year ago.
[46:18.58]And... It sucked.
[46:23.54]It was not funny.
[46:24.30]It was not entertaining.
[46:25.22]It was just like a shitty kid's book.
[46:28.46]That's it.
[46:28.98]It was fucking stupid.
[46:30.28]I don't want to make a video on that when nothing's interesting at all.
[46:33.14]It was bad.
[46:36.65]uh sprig just gave 500 what did he say they say what kind of game would you make if you could get a team together uh wrestling game a create a character wrestling game where you can make any fucking character you want and I've been doing this a lot too uh create a character wrestling game because the WWE games are fucking trash now
[47:00.64]They're terrible.
[47:01.70]They're made very poorly.
[47:03.70]Since 2015, 2K15, they've been fucking dog shit trash video games.
[47:08.77]So I would want it to be something like just like you could make anything you wanted.
[47:16.83]You can do anything you wanted.
[47:17.73]You can make custom rings, custom characters and not have any limitations.
[47:25.38]Hair combing game.
[47:27.64]Is there a hair combing game?
[47:35.39]Do I know how to play any instruments?
[47:36.55]The drums.
[47:38.41]I know how to play the drums.
[47:41.57]Maybe I could prove it to you someday.
[47:43.91]But I do know how to play the drums.
[47:49.21]I just have a drum set.
[47:50.89]And then I get rid of it.
[47:52.85]Like, that was like fucking 10 years ago.
[47:58.29]VR wrestling.
[48:03.45]What if you had to join... Wait, what?
[48:07.26]Do I need to play any real instruments?
[48:10.25]The drums aren't a real instrument?
[48:12.45]Yes, they are.
[48:14.17]What are you talking about?
[48:15.11]When am I going to announce my campaign for presidency?
[48:23.66]Right now.
[48:24.86]I'm running for president in 2060.
[48:29.32]I'm going to run for president in 2075.
[48:30.78]Although I'll probably be dead.
[48:37.21]Because right now, hold on.
[48:38.27]What am I?
[48:38.73]What am I?
[48:39.37]22?
[48:39.87]I'm 22 right now.
[48:40.79]So, you know, I'm a 22-year-old man right now.
[48:42.92]So, what, 60 years from now?
[48:46.10]70 years from now, I'll be dead.
[48:48.74]You know, because, man, when you're 22, you're a 22-year-old like me.
[48:52.82]You, uh, you know, you don't get much, you don't get much gas after, like, another 15 years, 20 years or so.
[48:58.95]But, you know, you know, no big deal.
[49:04.98]I'm too sure I'm not too short to run for president I am not too short to run for president there is no height requirement for running for president that's not an election year give me the next what's the next election year after 20 42 I don't know 22 left my ass off I'm not 47 I'm not 47 I didn't claim to be young
[49:32.90]even though I just did I just did claim to be young I claim to be very young too short for the debate podium under six feet well you look if you can be under six feet tall it's the shortest president was like excuse me hold on a second I just saw in the chat somebody's been spouting some extreme fucking bullshit
[49:59.98]The shortest president was James Madison.
[50:03.46]Go look up how tall James Madison was.
[50:06.02]He was like 5'1".
[50:08.52]He was fucking tiny.
[50:09.56]I missed bits.
[50:13.07]Oh, fuck.
[50:13.75]What an idiot.
[50:15.69]What did they say?
[50:19.67]Chicken tenders or chicken popcorn?
[50:24.41]Chicken strips, buddy.
[50:26.19]But thank you, Metal Socks, for the 420.
[50:28.79]No, I just said your fucking name.
[50:30.13]No, you gave 500.
[50:30.71]I'm getting texted.
[50:38.04]No.
[50:38.98]That's cute.
[50:42.24]Thank you.
[50:43.62]Thank you, person that just texted me.
[50:45.12]That was so sweet of you.
[50:50.73]5'1 is average like me?
[50:51.79]No.
[50:51.91]No.
[50:56.06]But no, chicken strips, man.
[50:57.56]Chicken tenders, chicken strips.
[51:04.72]Elak for the five bucks says, Hey, Jerma, two things.
[51:08.68]Can you say Alec Marsh?
[51:11.61]How do I deal with depression?
[51:14.45]Well, thank you, Elak, for the five dollars.
[51:19.17]I said Alec Marsh already, so I'll go to your next question.
[51:22.51]How do I deal with depression?
[51:25.10]Um...
[51:28.25]It's hard to talk about that only because everybody kind of has their own way to do it.
[51:35.52]You know what I mean?
[51:35.98]Like for me, how I deal with how I like when I start to feel bad or sad about something isn't necessarily exactly the case for you.
[51:43.87]And I don't want to be like, oh yeah, when I get depressed, I like to go buy a fucking tub of Ben and Jerry's ice cream and eat it on the couch while I cry.
[51:51.81]You know what I mean?
[51:52.31]Like me telling you what I do is not necessarily good for what you might want to do.
[51:56.47]But if I can say this, every single time I've ever been depressed, every single fucking time, every time,
[52:04.27]I've always thought like the world sucks.
[52:07.17]Nothing's going to fucking change.
[52:08.44]Everything's going to be awful.
[52:09.68]It's never going to get fucking better.
[52:11.50]But I guarantee you.
[52:15.01]It does.
[52:16.03]It fucking does.
[52:17.35]You might not think it's going to be, but trust me, wait like, just like stick it out.
[52:22.10]Try to make yourself feel better.
[52:23.20]Try to get back in track.
[52:25.42]In like a few weeks and like a few months, like a couple, a year after trying to, you'll get a new job.
[52:31.24]You'll find something else you're fucking interested in.
[52:33.62]It gets better.
[52:34.48]You will fucking feel better.
[52:38.16]I was depressed till I got a job.
[52:39.32]If you have a purpose, you don't have time to be depressed.
[52:41.60]That's exactly right.
[52:43.20]Like, so how you feel right now, you might not think is ever going to change, but life changes all the fucking time.
[52:49.36]We go through so many changes as people.
[52:51.90]You're going, stuff will, you will get better.
[52:55.28]It will happen.
[52:57.33]I, dude, like five or six years ago, when I, here, when I got diagnosed with like the colcolitis Crohn's bullshit,
[53:07.64]That was the worst time in my entire life.
[53:11.62]I was certain at that point.
[53:13.96]For a year straight, I was like, my fucking life sucks.
[53:19.22]Everything sucks.
[53:20.60]Life sucks.
[53:22.22]And I never thought it was going to get any fucking better.
[53:25.06]I was certain it wasn't going to get better.
[53:27.98]And then I went to more doctors and I started to eat a little bit healthier.
[53:32.88]I started living a much more healthier lifestyle.
[53:36.26]And...
[53:38.77]I, it got better.
[53:39.95]I got better.
[53:41.07]I started to feel better.
[53:42.23]I started not like fucking hate every day.
[53:44.85]You know what I mean?
[53:45.43]Like it's, it's, you will get fucking better.
[53:48.32]And now I'm on this new medication that is like, I may as well not even have it.
[53:55.54]And I feel great.
[53:58.24]This stream is getting too real.
[53:59.80]Well, I just like to, you know, you know what I mean?
[54:02.36]Like it's shit.
[54:04.95]You're going to be alright.
[54:07.37]Take it from me.
[54:08.69]You're going to be better.
[54:09.55]You'll be okay.
[54:10.25]You just got to give it some time and you got to work on it.
[54:14.05]Eating healthy sucks, but it's true.
[54:17.71]It can suck.
[54:19.82]But sometimes it's good.
[54:21.84]Sometimes it makes you feel better.
[54:25.40]Do I watch Vinesauce?
[54:28.28]Not particularly, but I mean, he seems like a pretty swell guy.
[54:31.18]Well, isn't it too?
[54:31.90]It's two guys, right?
[54:33.70]It's Joel and Vinny, right?
[54:37.25]Seem like pretty stand-up guys.
[54:39.35]I don't have anything negative to say about them.
[54:41.63]I've seen a couple of their streams once or twice.
[54:47.10]Killer Crocomire with the five bucks says, Streamer sucks.
[54:49.44]Didn't even comb.
[54:50.26]Missed my bits twice.
[54:51.92]One out of five stars on Yelp.
[54:54.12]Would not recommend.
[54:57.08]Hold on.
[54:59.40]Crocomire, I'm sorry.
[55:00.44]I'm just like fucking... My brain is just all over the place.
[55:11.24]There are multiple ones?
[55:14.60]No, I thought it was like... I don't know.
[55:15.56]I thought it was like a handful.
[55:16.48]It was more than two, whatever.
[55:18.14]I thought it was like... Who knows?
[55:21.86]But they're cool.
[55:23.38]But Crocodile, sorry.
[55:24.38]I suck.
[55:25.14]You're right.
[55:25.82]I should be paying more attention.
[55:32.74]I should play Paladins?
[55:37.11]I should.
[55:39.03]But I'm not.
[55:42.26]I would rate this a two out of five.
[55:46.04]Why?
[55:46.42]What have I done wrong?
[55:48.34]I didn't, I told you we got to the end of that DLC area and like I didn't, I just, I don't know.
[55:53.98]We thought this would be a funny idea.
[55:55.18]It kind of, it kind of has been funny.
[55:59.18]It's been fun.
[56:02.96]Where's the last installment of the Wonder Book series?
[56:04.94]I answered that.
[56:05.85]I answered that already.
[56:06.65]It just like ripped my fucking hair out.
[56:11.57]Play old school RuneScape.
[56:14.97]I'm not, that's not, not into that really at all.
[56:19.45]RuneScape is like an, I don't hate it, but can't necessarily say I'm like excited to play RuneScape anytime soon.
[56:28.99]Do I plan on watching the Super Bowl?
[56:32.41]Yeah.
[56:35.35]The Patriots are in it.
[56:36.13]That's kind of cool, I guess.
[56:37.83]If you're like a football fan, that's cool, I guess.
[56:43.45]Me being from New England and growing up in New England, that's kind of like heresy to say something like that.
[56:48.65]But I'm not like a big, I'm not like a big football guy.
[56:59.14]Look, I just wanted to do that so I could like lean back.
[57:01.10]I didn't want to break my shit.
[57:04.67]Play Spy Party again?
[57:05.67]I would.
[57:12.87]Oh, now you can see, like, the fucking trash that's all over the place in this room.
[57:19.08]Are you going to finish Club Penguin?
[57:20.70]I never fucking even opened Club Penguin.
[57:25.04]I've never even opened that fucking program.
[57:30.78]The Dutch angle?
[57:34.86]Jeans?
[57:35.36]I wear jeans.
[57:37.08]I don't know why that's so hard for people to understand that.
[57:41.10]I wear jeans.
[57:41.84]I wear t-shirts.
[57:42.66]I wear like fucking V-necks.
[57:47.74]Hoarder?
[57:48.30]No.
[57:48.72]This room is just a fucking mess.
[57:51.05]Because it's like every time I clean it up, I do something else stupid.
[57:55.31]And it gets worse.
[58:00.75]Do a cleaning stream program?
[58:02.71]Yeah, the fucking Club Penguin program.
[58:05.94]It's a pro.
[58:06.42]You open it.
[58:07.10]It's a program.
[58:08.12]Is that not correct?
[58:09.29]I believe that's fucking correct.
[58:11.83]Am I missing bits here?
[58:16.63]Hold on.
[58:23.78]I feel like I need like a fire behind me.
[58:26.46]You know what I mean?
[58:27.78]Wouldn't that be better if there was like a fucking fire right here?
[58:32.35]Wait, hold on a second.
[58:33.43]Wait, what?
[58:34.87]That would be fucking terrible.
[58:37.71]If there was a fire behind me?
[58:40.18]Why do I want a fire?
[58:42.80]No, no, that would be bad because then my fucking house would burn down.
[58:49.02]Yeah, wouldn't it be great if there was just a fucking fire behind me?
[58:53.83]Ow.
[58:58.39]is the stream by the way are there still more than 2 000 people we've gained viewers we have gained people since I started doing this hi well hi guys welcome what a wuss
[59:23.16]Like a contained fire?
[59:24.62]No, just a fire.
[59:26.38]Just like a nice fucking fire.
[59:33.08]I can't fucking do it.
[59:35.12]I'm sorry.
[59:37.03]I'm just like... I'm looking at the fucking viewer numbers and it's just like, what the fuck?
[59:45.13]Is this what you want?
[59:47.07]Is this what you want?
[59:48.73]You want this shit?
[59:56.41]Dude, did I like Resident Evil 7?
[59:57.75]Did it scare you a lot?
[59:58.53]Or was it just cheesy?
[59:59.35]It was fucking great.
[60:01.95]Well, let's rephrase that.
[60:04.03]Let's rephrase that.
[60:05.51]The first... The first six hours of Resident Evil 7 was fucking incredible.
[60:15.20]It was fantastic.
[60:17.00]After that... It slowed down to a point where I was getting really annoyed.
[60:23.68]A lot of you guys will remember being in the boat area.
[60:29.59]Like in the fucking underground ship when you were playing as the girl.
[60:33.63]That just sucked the total ass.
[60:36.19]It was just not fun.
[60:37.07]It was fucking awful.
[60:39.84]The game was like a 9.5 out of 10 for the first 6 hours.
[60:43.42]And then you get into that boat.
[60:45.34]And game sucks.
[60:46.86]Game sucks real bad.
[60:48.18]It was like a fucking 3 out of 10.
[60:50.22]So you take a 9.5 and then take a 3.5.
[60:54.10]Mix them together.
[60:54.90]Add a little bit of fucking vodka, you know, just to sweeten it up a little bit.
[60:58.56]Just to sweeten it up.
[60:59.70]And you got yourself like a fucking seven.
[61:03.13]No, it's not a seven.
[61:05.21]It's not a seven.
[61:11.51]I don't want to say eight.
[61:12.19]I ain't gonna say eight.
[61:17.32]Fuck, I can't give it a score.
[61:19.51]It's a fucking... It's a nine and a half, and then it's a three.
[61:25.69]And then it goes back up to like a seven.
[61:28.77]Okay?
[61:29.83]There you go.
[61:31.09]You know what?
[61:31.57]More people don't do that.
[61:33.45]More fucking game reviewers don't do that shit.
[61:36.05]I'm coining it.
[61:36.70]It's mine now, okay?
[61:38.34]You're here.
[61:38.72]The fucking like 2,300 people that are here right now, that's my shit now, right?
[61:42.10]That's my thing.
[61:44.16]Fuck giving the game a review, like a score, an end of the game score.
[61:48.55]Oh yeah, here's what it's an eight or it's a nine.
[61:50.31]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[61:52.39]We talk about how it is through the whole game.
[61:55.31]Think about that.
[61:57.31]Right?
[62:01.17]That's my thing.
[62:03.25]You know, you got the first portion, nine and a half.
[62:05.19]Okay.
[62:05.71]I know that it's going to be good for the first like six hours.
[62:08.31]Then you got like a three for the set, like the next like two hours.
[62:11.83]And then the final part of the game, seven.
[62:15.11]9.537.
[62:15.19]That's my fucking score for Resident Evil 7.
[62:20.67]And that's trademarked, by the way.
[62:21.87]You use that, you're going to get sued.
[62:32.29]Ratings crisis.
[62:37.22]And he will never review another fucking game ever again.
[62:43.82]How does that work for games that don't end?
[62:45.12]I don't know, man.
[62:54.11]I just spit my drink.
[62:55.77]I'm sorry, dude.
[62:56.63]I haven't combed my hair in a while either.
[63:04.03]What do I think of the new season if it's always sunny?
[63:07.00]Well, I think Always Sunny is a great show.

[74:00.12]So it's not going to be one of those situations where you can expect it like all the fucking time, you know.

[74:52.70]The subreddit.
[74:54.86]I look at that.
[74:55.54]I just want to make sure.

[75:16.01]I started like three or four minutes early today.
[75:18.09]At least that.
[75:21.15]Wait, hold on.

[75:37.28]It's got potatoes.
[75:39.94]It's got cheese.
[75:41.67]You mix it all up.
[75:42.93]It all goes to the same place.
[75:44.03]Who cares?
[75:45.11]Yeah, I like it.
[75:45.77]It's good.
[75:47.43]I enjoy it.
[75:50.92]uh step step mcdrab gave five bucks and they say sorry for asking repeatedly but do you have any advice for becoming a semi-respectable online voice actor I'm struggling to get past the voicing bad anime fan dubs phase um you I've been so far out of the game when it comes to like online voices and online cartoons and stuff the only like the only thing I could say
[76:23.34]It's hard because when I was doing it, this is back during a time when Newgrounds was huge and everybody was on Newgrounds and there were so many cartoons and games and shit that people were making on Newgrounds.
[76:36.93]So it's kind of a different world now where you need to almost make your own
[76:42.63]shit like you need to make your own way it is not like a ton of cartoons being made on Newgrounds anymore at least Newgrounds isn't like the hopping place that it used to be like 10 years ago so it's hard to to give advice on that because I just don't know what like the the state of the online voice and cartoon industry is like right now
[77:12.59]What comb is that?
[77:13.37]It's a shitty CVS comb.
[77:16.83]That's it.
[77:20.41]But hopefully that helps at all.
[77:22.42]I mean, there are still online communities.
[77:23.84]There's like the voice acting boards.
[77:26.26]There's... I mean, just make your demo.
[77:30.98]If you don't have a demo, you should have one.
[77:35.05]And send it around.
[77:36.27]That's really all you can do.
[77:37.35]Send it to people that you know have... are working on animated projects.
[77:41.53]Send it to different casting agencies.
[77:43.77]You just have to get your name out there.
[77:45.70]There's really no other way to say it.
[77:51.68]Try to get a YouTube Red cartoon.
[77:54.80]No, they wouldn't let me have one.
[77:56.62]I would want to do too much fucking weird shit.
[77:58.21]They wouldn't let me do it.
[78:00.17]I would want to do just shit that they would not want on YouTube Red.
[78:09.32]Uh, leather jacket, five bucks.
[78:10.74]Leather jacket, what's going on, dude?
[78:12.79]One of them mods.
[78:13.41]I just got back from the Philly Auto Show as a car guy.
[78:15.93]I must ask, what kind of car do you drive?
[78:18.21]And what kind of cars do you like?
[78:19.89]I don't think I asked you this.
[78:21.21]Uh, I'm not like a big car guy.
[78:23.73]I'll tell you the car I do want.
[78:25.68]The car that I actually want bad is a Tesla.
[78:30.22]I want a Tesla fucking bad.
[78:33.42]But they're like 75 billion dollars.
[78:36.83]So...
[78:38.50]I want a Tesla.
[78:40.24]Because they look fucking cool as hell.
[78:42.30]And they're like super technological.
[78:45.04]You know what I'm saying?
[78:49.06]Yeah, Tesla.
[78:50.77]The car I drive right now is... It's a Chevy Malibu.
[78:58.95]It's cute.
[79:00.59]It's a little cute car.
[79:05.99]Start donating.
[79:06.69]We have to hit the 75 billion mark.
[79:11.37]Oh, somebody donated.
[79:14.69]Be careful, Jeremy.
[79:15.33]The more you comb your hair, the faster you'll go bald.
[79:17.38]Also, I love how you come up with an idea like I wish there was a fire behind me.
[79:22.58]And realize how awful of a situation that would be after saying it.
[79:25.58]Because I'm fucking... My brain is a fried egg.
[79:30.49]I'm just imagining there being a flame behind me.
[79:34.62]You drive the same car?
[79:35.68]It's not a bad car.
[79:36.68]It's a good car.
[79:37.94]The Chevy Malibu is like a cool car.
[79:40.88]It gets the job done.
[79:41.84]It fucking drives.
[79:42.68]It's a four-cylinder.
[79:45.56]Is it a four-cylinder?
[79:49.38]Is Chevy Malibu a four-cylinder car?
[79:51.98]Or do I have that completely fucking wrong?
[79:55.99]It's not a six-cylinder, is it?
[80:00.81]It's four.
[80:02.17]Okay.
[80:03.19]It's four.

[80:17.67]I don't do drugs.
[80:23.97]Oh, I can make this sound.
[80:24.83]You hear that?
[80:29.24]They have both minds at four.
[80:30.34]Okay.
[80:32.26]It's a two-cylinder?
[80:33.10]It's not a two-cylinder car.
[80:34.14]They don't even fucking make those.
[80:38.67]How do you improve at entertaining?
[80:42.53]I don't know.

[85:14.11]Stylo was their lead single.
[85:19.02]Melancholy Hill was another single.
[85:20.86]Those are great fucking songs.
[85:24.92]It's not on the album.
[85:25.90]Okay.
[85:29.97]It's confirmed to not be part of the album.
[85:31.51]That's good to hear, though.
[85:32.29]That's good to hear.
[85:32.79]That's very good to hear.
[85:37.05]Dunk-O-Matic was fucking cool, too.
[85:38.35]A lot of people didn't like that song.
[85:39.55]I thought that song was great.
[85:42.83]Dunk-O-Matic, he just kind of was like, you know, here's more music.
[85:46.83]Take this.
[85:47.23]I thought it was alright.
[85:48.47]I thought it was good.
[85:52.04]Hold on, I gotta open my Twitch alerts back up.
[85:54.54]I fucking can't see it.
[85:59.71]Melanie Collie Hill is amazing.
[86:01.05]I think that's one of their best songs.
[86:04.93]Rhinestone Eyes was also a great song.
[86:06.37]That album is full of fucking great songs.
[86:09.49]Plastic Beach is like just as good as Demon Days.
[86:14.15]Come at me.
[86:17.34]It had a much different feel than Demon Days did.
[86:22.70]But I think it was like there was enough great songs to rival Demon Days.
[86:28.50]uh dead deado says Jerma do you know people are using your birthday song from one of the rap movies and remixes I'm aware I'm aware of all those fucking remixes I've I've seen them I've I've clicked on them and it's whatever people can do whatever they want they have fun they're very versatile yeah they are
[86:56.12]But thank you, Dedo, for the five bucks.
[86:59.32]Mr. Champ, for the 11 months, thanks a lot.
[87:01.20]Watch old videos on stream.
[87:05.01]Not right now.
[87:06.23]I'm too busy combing my hair with fucking a comb that I dropped in alcohol like two hours ago.
[87:10.89]I'm going to have to fucking take a shower.
[87:15.11]How large is my meme collection?
[87:25.40]Pretty big.
[87:28.68]Pretty big.
[87:32.76]Keep going.
[87:35.95]What would I consider a clown car?
[87:38.13]A tiny little fucking car that can be driven into a wall.
[87:43.82]Hey, thank you, Liduda.
[87:46.10]Liduda, thanks a lot.
[87:47.18]Welcome.
[87:51.54]And that's it for bits right now.
[87:55.79]My chair is really squeaky.
[87:56.63]I need to put like WD-40 on it.
[87:57.95]I know.
[87:58.67]It's fucking horrible.
[88:03.53]Can I have the shirts be in bigger sizes like 6XL?
[88:07.41]Well, it's on Teespring.
[88:09.39]Because I don't know how Teespring does their sizes.
[88:13.15]I think they have their own sizes.
[88:14.37]I can't like determine what they are.
[88:16.25]All I can do is like give the design and tell them these are the shirts that I want.
[88:19.75]So I'll see if I can do that option.
[88:21.88]I'm not sure if I can.
[88:23.56]But we'll see.
[88:28.94]Somebody made a sound mod of me in Payday 2.
[88:30.90]That's cool.
[88:34.44]Hopefully people enjoy it.
[88:36.83]Hopefully you use it and you think it's fun and funny.
[88:43.49]What's my Harry Potter house?
[88:44.49]Slytherin.
[88:47.01]Slytherin.

[89:13.73]Was I popular in high school?
[89:17.01]No, that depends on what you mean by that.
[89:20.21]I had a lot of friends in high school.
[89:22.11]I had a lot of like people that I was in contact with.
[89:24.41]I had a lot of
[89:26.91]You know, a lot of people thought I was fucking funny.
[89:30.48]I was one of those guys that was like, oh, that's the funny guy.
[89:32.62]He's okay.
[89:35.20]I won't beat him up.
[89:37.30]Even though that's not true, because I did, like, I got, like, I got bullied in, like, not high school, but in, like, middle school, going into high school.
[89:44.89]So.
[89:46.29]Which sucks.
[89:47.97]But I think, um, wait, Jeremy, yes or no?
[89:58.65]Yeah, because, well, it's a short, we'll go back to the height thing.
[90:01.53]I got bullied because I was small.
[90:04.13]Because I was a small kid.
[90:06.86]So what happened was when I was like a little kid, I got bullied because I was like five feet tall going into like ninth grade or like eighth grade.
[90:15.24]So I was like, alright, I better be fucking funny.
[90:19.25]If I'm going to be like tiny boy, I better be fucking real funny.
[90:23.59]I would tell jokes, you know?
[90:24.57]I would tell all kinds of jokes.
[90:25.61]I would do this thing when I had a handkerchief and I'd put a knife in it and I'd blow my nose and I'd go like this and it looked like the... We'll show you.
[90:32.29]I'll show you.
[90:32.63]I'll show you my fucking oldest trick in the book.
[90:34.97]I'll show you.
[90:37.29]I used to... At the lunch table, you know what I mean?
[90:39.59]I used to go like this.
[90:40.21]I used to put this up like this and pretend I was blowing my nose and go... And holy shit, was that fucking funny.
[90:52.89]Wasn't fucking funny, and then I didn't do that.
[90:55.09]I promise you I did not do that a knife Yeah, I used to take a fucking knife, but I used to go like this Joke sucks
[91:25.05]You've said too much.
[91:27.56]Well, not a knife, like a, like a, we're talking like a plastic fucking like butter knife.
[91:38.62]I've seen a lot of like the fucking, oh god.
[91:46.91]No, I'm talking about like, the like little white plastic like forks and knives.
[91:55.44]Look, I'm telling you right now, if you came at me with a white plastic knife and you stabbed the shit out of me, like right now, you come in this fucking door right over here and you stab the absolute shit out of me with one of those things, I'm going to be like, oh, dude, whoa, excuse me.
[92:12.55]Whoa, easy, easy, man, easy.
[92:13.85]What's wrong?
[92:14.15]Are you okay?
[92:14.67]I'm going to be fine.
[92:28.63]It was a spoon.
[92:29.81]We'll just say it was a fucking spoon.
[92:33.55]Incoming comedy.
[92:37.59]Incoming comedy.
[92:40.36]Right.
[92:40.60]I'm not gonna see him anymore.
[92:45.98]Alright, any more questions?
[92:48.26]What else we got?
[92:55.49]Ster behind the curtain?

[93:10.08]As... As much as I can say, uh, uh, comb your hair down's not up.
[93:14.62]No, I'd comb... I... I can't comb my hair down.
[93:18.38]It doesn't do anything.
[93:19.06]It just looks fucking stupid.
[93:28.69]That was a long exhale.
[93:29.65]Can we have a live house tour?
[93:37.17]no no not now slick your hair back I actually I probably could do that couldn't I I probably could do that can I go hide behind the curtain you want me to go hide behind the curtain
[93:57.24]We could do a thing where, okay, what about this?
[93:59.70]What if I got behind that curtain, right?
[94:04.20]And we waited like fucking 10 minutes of me just not being here at all.
[94:08.32]I'm fucking behind that curtain.
[94:10.65]And like new people that are coming into the IRL stream right now, after 10 minutes, I fucking rip the thing open and just scream.
[94:20.07]I fucking just like tear it open and scream.
[94:23.69]You think we'd get anybody?
[94:24.41]You think we'd like prank somebody doing that?
[94:26.90]Would that be a good prank?
[94:29.89]Would I get prank points with you guys?
[94:35.47]Please do that.
[94:43.14]God fucking damn it.
[94:44.16]Am I really about to do this?
[94:47.10]We're gonna lose a shitload of people.
[94:51.56]Can I even get back there?
[94:52.54]I don't think I can even get fucking back there.
[94:57.90]Hold on.
[94:59.50]Make sure my leg flies up.
[95:02.42]Test plus 10 prank points?

[95:43.60]I ain't fucking doing this.
[95:51.02]No, this is stupid.
[95:51.86]This is fucking really stupid.
[95:53.88]I'm not doing that.
[95:55.56]I'm not sitting behind that fucking curtain for 10 minutes.
[95:59.16]That's not gonna fucking happen.
[96:01.34]I've got spider webs all over me.

[96:26.49]Ruin the joke?
[96:27.21]Yeah, well, I got somebody.
[96:28.35]Somebody just clicked the stream two seconds ago.
[96:31.11]Right?

[96:33.39]And they just see that, like, there's a fucking... Wait, a guy just came out of there.
[96:36.41]Holy shit.
[96:40.83]No, you guys are the ones that got pranked.
[96:51.69]I... I can't...

[97:12.78]Wait, wait, hold on a second.
[97:15.06]Wait a second.
[97:20.98]Resident Evil.
[97:23.76]Resident Evil is like still here.
[97:25.57]Hold on, hold on.
[97:33.43]Hold on a second.
[97:35.09]Hey, you guys ready?
[97:35.69]Ready?
[97:43.08]Oh fuck, my stream is crashing.
[97:47.06]Stream crashed.
[97:49.00]Hey, remember this?
[97:49.62]Holy shit, this is on a delay.
[97:53.54]Hold on.
[97:55.28]Oh my god, this is gonna be fucking impossible to do.
[97:58.66]Check this out, guys.
[97:59.40]Ready?
[98:01.72]I am not looking at the game.
[98:05.38]I am looking at the OBS window.
[98:09.73]So...
[98:13.59]It's like a full second delayed.
[98:15.61]You think I can do this?
[98:18.49]Oh my god, this is gonna be fucking impossible.
[98:24.04]It's a full second behind.
[98:28.42]Why was this still here?
[98:32.06]Do I have a timer?
[98:33.50]Please tell me there's a timer.
[98:35.81]Am I gonna break the fucking Resident Evil 7 record?
[98:42.78]Alright, we gotta get in the building.
[98:47.34]This way, right?
[98:47.88]Yep.
[98:53.62]Let's see what happens when I get in here.
[99:04.23]It's not like I could play before.
[99:05.59]Hey, easy.
[99:06.09]Easy.
[99:06.35]Easy.
[99:14.04]Where's the fucking door?
[99:15.40]There it is.
[99:15.76]Okay.
[99:17.00]Let's go.
[99:17.36]This is not possible to walk around like this.
[99:31.91]What is that?
[99:36.33]I died there?
[99:37.09]That's one of my deaths?
[99:39.50]I can't...
[99:49.16]Who gives a shit?
[99:50.44]We're going back to combing our hair.
[99:51.56]There's a serious lack of comb on this stream.
[99:59.79]I know.
[100:00.09]I'm sorry, guys.
[100:02.95]I can still hear it.
[100:03.63]I can still fucking hear it blasting.
[100:12.34]Okay.
[100:16.02]Ethan lies here.
[100:16.94]Well, at least I knew I died there, yeah.
[100:22.20]This game actually sucks.
[100:23.32]No, it doesn't.
[100:25.52]Alright.
[100:27.48]I think I'm going to go like rethink my whole life because I just did like a two and a half hour comb stream.
[100:40.59]Let me check.
[100:41.49]Let's see if this is going to be bigger.
[100:49.21]A little bit bigger, come on.
[100:51.87]Come on, come on.
[100:54.81]Okay.
[101:03.94]There we go.
[101:05.18]Okay, so.
[101:08.88]Why am I still holding this?
[101:13.14]Get the fuck out of here.
[101:14.88]Get out of here, get the fuck away from me.
[101:16.90]Like I just dropped like three things, okay.
[101:20.05]It was a great comb stream.
[101:20.93]Well, thank you.
[101:22.87]Let me get some more people here.
[101:24.55]Would you ever consider doing an art stream?
[101:26.37]Painting Roadhog was one of the most inspiring things I've ever seen.
[101:29.44]Yeah, I mean, I do pretty much fucking whatever I want.
[101:36.04]And if that means I'm going to do something fucking stupid, that means I do something stupid.
[101:38.46]And that means I do something, playing a game, then playing a game.
[101:44.41]But yeah, I'm down to do whatever, man.
[101:46.85]I would do another painting stream just to be like a fuck face, you know, whatever.
[101:52.03]I got prank points.
[101:52.85]Thank you, Bat, for the prank points.
[101:58.44]Can you confirm or are you not a shit?
[102:01.04]What?
[102:01.30]What are you talking about?
[102:07.20]This has been better than the Karazhan stream?
[102:10.37]Anything is better than the fucking Karazhan stream.
[102:12.01]That stream was fucking terrible.
[102:15.67]Have I been working out?
[102:16.85]I have.
[102:18.23]Not as much as I should, but yes, I have.
[102:19.71]What?
[102:20.15]What?
[102:22.97]After having this Jerm in my system for five months, how far has it spread?
[102:26.49]I don't know, a flat, but thanks for the five months.
[102:29.39]It's at least in your face.
[102:34.26]Whatever that means.
[102:38.08]Plus eight prank points?
[102:39.06]Nice.
[102:39.28]Thanks, man.
[102:41.52]I'll take those prank points.
[102:42.80]I'll spend them on something good.
[102:44.20]Frog stream was the best stream?
[102:49.20]I agree.
[102:55.79]But, yeah, I think that's gonna be it, guys.
[102:58.33]Uh... I guess I wasn't anticipating the DLC to be, like, less than... Potentially, like, an hour or two long.
[103:05.29]And, you know, whatever.
[103:05.97]Fuck it.
[103:06.25]Just decided to do this, too.
[103:07.91]Because let's have some fun, right?
[103:13.74]But I still hear Resident Evil.
[103:17.48]Uh, can I please confirm the date of the diaper stream?
[103:19.58]There is not going to be a diaper stream.
[103:23.07]That's not gonna fucking happen.
[103:25.89]I don't know where you guys are getting this idea that there's going to be a diaper stream.
[103:31.55]No, who told you that?
[103:33.73]It wasn't me.
[103:37.91]But thanks, everybody, for hanging out.
[103:44.06]I just had this free subscription laying around and you are definitely my favorite entertainer.
[103:46.92]Have a great night.
[103:47.42]Well, thank you, munificence.
[103:52.50]I'll call you muni.
[103:53.22]Thanks for the free bucks.
[103:55.96]No shirtless, no shirtless.
[103:57.62]This shirt is staying on.
[103:59.72]It's not coming off.
[104:03.30]Oh, and Black Mage right here at the end.
[104:04.98]Five bucks.
[104:05.54]Hey, Jerma, just want to say thank you for all the laughs you've given us over the years from the TF2 YouTube videos all the way to now.
[104:09.55]Thank you.
[104:11.05]Thank you, Black Mage.
[104:12.47]That's very kind of you.
[104:14.13]You are fucking awesome.
[104:16.41]And so aren't the rest of you.
[104:21.59]Dipe hype.
[104:25.25]No, no, no, no.
[104:27.59]No.
