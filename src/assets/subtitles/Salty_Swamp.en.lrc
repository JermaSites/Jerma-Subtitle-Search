[00:19.06]God!
[00:22.18]I'm never gonna be able to find it!
[00:27.67]Hey, uh, you lost something?
[00:30.55]No, no, no, no, no.
[00:31.87]I'm just fishing for the super, ultra rare, sacred fish of Salting Swamp!
[00:38.98]Sorry.
[00:39.86]Legend has it,
[00:41.89]If it gets on your line, it takes you to a secret treasure.
[00:47.09]Okay.
[00:49.97]You must be new around here, huh?
[00:52.25]Am I right?
[00:54.15]Yeah, I'm drawn.
[00:56.83]My name's Loki.
[00:58.35]I'm the so-called village idiot around here.
[01:01.80]Why is that?
[01:03.18]Well, I've been coming back to the same spot for three years now.
[01:06.78]Trying to catch this mysterious fish.
[01:11.26]I am the sacred fish of Salty Swamp.
[01:14.51]Thank you for finding me, because my true power can only be... Excuse me, my friend.
[01:20.87]I'm over here.
[01:21.69]If you would look at me while I'm trying to talk to you.
[01:24.57]Excuse me, my friend.
[01:25.72]I am over here.
[01:27.64]You found me.
[01:28.72]Hello, you found me.
[01:31.50]I'm right here.
[01:33.02]You want to look at me for a second?
[01:34.32]I'm trying to talk to you.
[01:38.74]Hey, idiot!
[01:40.18]Throw your goddamn fishing pole over here!
[01:44.38]Oh, what the fuck?
[01:46.70]Look at me!
[01:48.82]I'll blow this fucking old lady's fucking head off if you don't look at me!
[01:54.15]Now look at me!
[02:00.67]Put the gun down, crazy Samaritan, or I will shoot you!
[02:04.65]You can eat my shit, copper!
[02:07.44]Take him out boys!
[02:08.46]Fire at will!
[02:21.02]Hey, did you, uh, did you hear something?
[02:27.90]No.
[02:30.43]I guess it was all just my imagination.
[02:32.72]Well, I mean, I have been out here for a really long time, man.
[02:36.94]And sometimes I just want to go CRAZY!
[02:41.32]Holy man juice!
[02:43.26]Huh.
[02:45.27]What the hell is wrong with your eyes, man?
[02:47.27]That was wicked freaky deaky if you ask me.
[02:49.93]Sorry.
[02:51.13]Nah, man, that's cool.
[02:53.33]Hey, you should come to the village professor with me.
[02:56.51]What do you say?
[02:57.49]Hey, did you hear that?
[02:58.92]We should tell the boss about this magical fish.
[03:02.21]I'm hungry.
[03:04.21]Yes, this is good news.
[03:06.30]The boss will be much obliged.
[03:21.59]Well, here we are.
[03:29.75]Maybe he is Gnome?
[03:32.87]Are you kidding me?
[03:34.97]This guy hasn't left his house in 10 years.
[03:36.92]Ugh!
[03:40.18]Alligators!
[03:41.44]Professor, it's me, you know, Loki.
[03:44.28]Wacky.
[03:45.10]Loki.
[03:46.08]Wackja.
[03:46.90]Loki.
[03:48.26]Laxative?
[03:49.66]Loki!
[03:51.04]Loki!
[03:52.32]How are you?
[03:52.98]Please come in.
[03:54.54]Who's your little friend?
[03:56.02]Dron.
[03:56.80]He's pretty new around here and I figured maybe you'd want to meet him.
[04:02.59]Wow!
[04:03.29]I've never seen anything like this!
[04:05.51]This is amazing!
[04:06.75]Thank you very much.
[04:10.51]What's that?
[04:12.39]That little guy over there was the result of a three-year alchemy and life research project.
[04:17.61]I created him from a blade of grass.
[04:20.07]Don't even listen to that.
[04:20.85]He bought the damn thing.
[04:22.51]From Petco.
[04:24.57]Let's get down to business, Loki.
[04:27.06]Did you find it?
[04:28.66]Nope.
[04:29.82]Still can't seem to track him down.
[04:32.52]Yo!
[04:34.30]But hey, Professor, you should take a look at Dron's eyes.
[04:37.36]They have this really, really strange ability.
[04:41.02]Oh, of course, Loki.
[04:42.34]Come over here, my friend.
[04:43.41]Let me see.
[04:47.15]I don't see anything too out of the ordinary.
[04:48.77]Just a little bit of... Oh, my...
[04:55.33]Oh my god, are you okay?
[04:56.65]Professor, are you okay?
[04:58.13]Oh no.
[04:59.37]This is terrible.
[05:00.83]Do you want us to get a doctor?
[05:02.49]Something we should call a doctor.
[05:03.99]Just awful.
[05:05.71]This is one of the worst days of my life.
[05:08.15]I think his leg might be fractured.
[05:10.89]I can't believe this happened to me.
[05:15.25]I broke my penis enlarging potion.
[05:18.79]This is terrible.
[05:28.35]of fish in the water, inside the water.
[05:34.10]We overheard these two crocs, right?
[05:36.88]They were talking about some secret fish or something.
[05:40.44]Oh really?
[05:42.26]Yeah, I mean, I don't exactly know what it does, but it could probably get us... Power, you say?
[05:48.76]Well, not exactly, but if we look into it, we could probably get some... Intelligence, you say?
[05:55.04]When I trace my hand on a piece of paper, it looks like a turkey.
[05:59.58]Bring me this.
