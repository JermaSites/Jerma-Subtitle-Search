[00:02.34]What's uh, what's with all the hearts?
[00:05.88]You guys are getting the voice, yes you are.
[00:14.18]Gotta open up the fucking package first.
[00:18.90]This is, this is a sealed game.
[00:29.21]I can't wait to crash OBS.
[00:30.31]It's going to be fucking fantastic because I'm plugging in the webcam again.
[00:33.48]Because if I... No, hold on.
[00:36.10]Let me just make sure I can do this.
[00:40.18]Lord.
[00:42.44]To an unboxing?
[00:43.56]No.
[00:47.37]If this is a 30 minute install, I'm going to laugh my ass off.
[00:56.29]Hey, this game came out in 2014.
[01:00.04]Are you fucking kidding me?
[01:03.15]No way.
[01:06.89]No way this game fucking... 2014.
[01:11.37]Surprising.
[01:16.14]Ow.
[01:16.56]Fuck.
[01:17.36]Ow.
[01:19.20]Okay.
[01:20.00]Let's see.
[01:24.56]Having trouble scoring.
[01:25.97]Hold on.
[01:26.29]Let me make sure.
[01:34.40]This is gonna break the fucking stream, I can already tell you.
[01:36.76]Is it even plugged in?
[01:44.85]Probably not.
[01:46.63]Alright, hashtag pray.
[01:47.69]I fucking hate technology.
[01:56.29]Like, all computers suck.
[01:59.14]Can we be fucking honest with ourselves here?
[02:02.32]Every computer sucks.
[02:06.02]All of them do.
[02:07.41]Every device.
[02:08.63]Every PC.
[02:09.39]Every computer.
[02:14.31]Here we go.
[02:18.19]It's gonna fucking happen.
[02:19.13]I already know it.
[02:19.86]You don't have to tell me twice.
[02:23.80]My room's a fucking mess.
[02:25.84]I blame technology for that one too.
[02:33.15]Let me see here.
[02:33.77]Hold on.
[02:37.38]Here we go.
[02:38.65]Good luck.
[02:40.29]Otherwise, I have to restart the stream.
[02:42.01]Let's see what happens.
[02:50.30]Oh, look.
[02:50.62]It didn't work.
[02:56.55]I'll be right back.
[03:17.48]Why am I doing this shit right now?
[03:24.00]One second.
[03:32.30]I gotta get the right color here.
[03:44.89]This shit, this is all incorrect.
[03:47.55]Whatever.
[03:47.81]Who gives a fuck?
[03:50.19]You know what I mean?
[03:53.96]Who honestly gives a fuck?
[03:55.84]Look at my fucking clown.
[03:56.80]I got plenty of good clown hair, though.
[03:58.78]Plenty of clown hair.
[04:11.98]Refresh.
[04:13.86]I'm going to fix the sink, too.
[04:15.06]Hold on.
[04:15.52]Hold on.
[04:16.04]I'll get it.
[04:17.68]I will fix the sync.
[04:23.12]Gonna figure that shit out.
[04:26.12]Filters, here it is.
[04:29.73]Video delay.
[04:36.21]Bye, here it is.
[04:37.63]Watch this.
[04:38.85]Bingo.
[04:41.41]Bingo.
[04:43.21]There we go.
[04:44.03]It works.
[04:44.73]We're ready to play the fucking voice.
[04:50.45]Right?
[04:54.11]No more desync.
[04:55.49]We're all good.
[04:57.83]Bingo.
[05:11.66]Calibrating lag for your TV.
[05:12.70]You see the top left?
[05:15.68]You see that?
[05:19.34]Gotta change this shit.
[05:22.29]I just clicked on like Vinny's stream.
[05:24.91]Whoops.
[05:26.99]Go back.
[05:28.50]I'm getting like an ad.
[05:33.10]I'm going to wait for people to come back because obviously this is important.
[05:42.61]The voice.
[05:43.65]I don't know if that's the right name of the game, but whatever.
[05:45.37]I don't care.
[05:51.82]Okay, here we go.
[05:55.27]I gotta press this button to start the game.
[05:59.89]Microphone's plugged in.
[06:01.31]Please make sure that you set the TV volume to your normal playing level.
[06:04.21]Try to reduce background noises.
[06:05.41]Hold the microphone close to your fucking TV speaker.
[06:11.31]Why?
[06:11.51]Huh?
[06:15.64]What are you doing?
[06:23.36]What is this doing?
[06:53.45]Skip, fucking skip it.
[07:04.95]Jesus Christ.
[07:06.51]Alright, vocal coach.
[07:12.03]New artist.
[07:16.18]Me.
[07:19.04]That works, me.
[07:23.13]Me.
[07:23.81]Okay, let's do some warm-up exercises.
[07:34.36]Warm up your face and get ready to sing.
[07:36.38]Okay, face stretches.
[07:39.59]For this vocal warm-up, we're going to concentrate on warming up your face.
[07:44.32]So, use your hands to massage your cheeks.
[07:47.26]You're not fucking serious.
[07:48.32]Use your tongue to sweep around your mouth and touch your teeth from one side to the other and top to bottom.
[07:54.63]This should help to wake up the muscles and exercise your tongue as well as your jaw.
[07:59.49]Scrunch up your face.
[08:01.13]Close your eyes.
[08:01.79]Get, get, what are you talking about?
[08:03.61]Here we go.
[08:12.31]like this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[08:36.75]I'm sorry.
[08:37.17]I'm sorry.
[08:37.63]Big fucking teeth you have.
[09:07.30]Feeling warmed up yet?
[09:08.32]90 seconds, we're going, we're going.
[09:16.21]Wait, wait, wait, I forgot, I gotta mention this, very important.
[09:19.59]Look at my t-shirt.
[09:20.09]I'm wearing a fucking gigantic t-shirt.
[09:26.63]Breathing, let's get this right.
[09:28.63]Like all physical activity, singing works best.
[09:32.04]Breathing, this is a breathing exercise.
[09:36.96]I got this shirt for free like four years ago.
[09:38.90]This game is awful, by the way.
[09:40.90]Okay.
[09:41.08]So let's just relax real quick.
[09:47.37]I'm going to take it.
[09:54.79]Nailed it.
[10:02.99]Fucking easiest game I've ever played.
[10:15.39]I'm good.
[10:23.06]I'm ready to play.
[10:27.36]I'm ready to go.
[10:28.09]I think so.

[12:14.64]You guys can hear it.
[12:16.22]And they said, what?
[12:43.54]Better you remember, party up.

[13:25.36]Now December found the love that we shared in September.
[13:32.22]Only blue talking love would remember the true love that we shared today.
[13:40.17]Fucking killing it!
[13:57.76]Easy fucking game.
[13:59.14]Easy fucking game.
[14:03.42]Easiest game you ever seen me play.
[14:06.06]Do you remember that cloudy day that was in fucking September?
[14:09.43]I do.
[14:11.31]And we are singing
[14:29.03]This song is louder than I thought it was.
[14:30.51]This song is longer than I thought it was.
[14:46.31]It's a fucking seven minute song.
[15:14.43]I already fucking won the game.
[15:16.51]I already beat the game.
[15:21.25]Pop, R&B, rock, country, which one?
[15:25.39]Rock, baby.
[15:30.64]Oh, cheers, Marvin.
[15:31.40]72%, that's a C-.
[15:33.30]Okay, crap.

[15:53.43]By the way, that's all you're going to get.
[15:58.47]Easy.
[16:05.34]A plus.
[16:06.02]At least it's an A plus.
[16:07.00]Alright, next round.
[16:07.68]Let's go.
[16:33.62]You guys want me on the front page of, like, our cringe?
[16:36.32]Is that what you guys are trying to get me on?
[16:38.40]You want me on the front page of, like, our fuckface?
[16:41.40]Our, like, tools on the internet?
[16:43.16]Alright, I'm battling somebody?
[16:54.29]That is the plan.
[16:54.87]Of course it is.
[16:57.14]Why can't you not hear me?
[16:57.90]This should be mic feedback.
[17:08.67]I'm not drunk enough.
[17:16.87]I haven't had enough to drink for this one.
[17:19.56]Fuck, I have to do it.
[17:20.42]There's no escaping it.
[17:24.79]Not even close Not even close Not even fucking close I don't even know what this song is, but I'm gonna do it
[18:03.67]I don't want to be on camera anymore!
[18:04.93]I don't want to be on camera anymore!
[18:12.47]Look at this guy in the background.
[18:19.65]This guy's fucking killing it in the background.
[18:21.41]Look at this guy in the background.
[18:24.01]Be careful what they make their wishes in the dark.
[18:26.79]Dark, dark, can't be sure.
[18:27.99]I don't know the song.
[18:28.77]This is like bad karaoke.
[18:31.29]Man, you mean time.
[18:32.72]I'm just dreaming.
[18:33.88]I've been tearing you apart.
[18:37.65]That's me.
[18:39.61]Just pretend.
[18:40.44]Here we go.
[18:40.92]This song is fucking terrible.
[18:43.18]What a bad song.
[18:43.96]That's a bad song.
[19:06.71]That's a bad song.
[19:07.59]That's not a good song.
[19:08.95]Sorry.
[19:09.22]I'm sorry.
[19:10.14]I had to quit.
[19:12.48]I don't know those songs.
[19:19.64]I'm not going to pretend I don't know how to play them.
[19:31.73]I don't know how to sing them.
[19:41.66]Where are the good songs?
[19:42.92]How many songs do I have?
[19:45.52]There's like fucking 15 songs in this whole game.
[19:51.58]Add a song?
[19:51.95]No.
[20:13.35]No, no, no way.
[20:15.66]I sang the one song I would like to sing.
[20:19.48]Here we go.
[20:19.94]Here's my girl.
[20:22.71]This one goes out to all the females and the males.
[20:24.25]All of you.
[20:36.89]I've got sunshine on a cloudy day And when it's cold outside I guess you'd say What can make me feel this way?
[21:05.99]It's my girl.
[21:08.62]My girl.
[21:10.40]My girl.
[21:11.32]Talking about my girl.
[21:16.54]We're done with this one.
[21:18.50]Get this fucking microphone out of here.
[21:20.28]I ain't doing this anymore.
[21:21.16]I ain't gonna be one of these fucking streamers.
[21:29.83]Think you're gonna get one of these out of me?
[21:38.99]You got enough.
[21:39.73]You got a little bit from me.
[21:48.93]You got about five minutes.
[21:54.19]There you are.
[22:13.28]That better be heard from again.
[22:29.95]I was gonna start singing it again.
[22:31.05]God damn it.
[22:31.85]That's unfortunate.
[22:33.15]I was gonna sing it again.
[22:40.85]Okay.
[22:42.83]Who was next?
[22:49.98]Now I'm gonna be on the front page of our fuckface.
[22:52.10]What have I done with my life?
[23:20.30]It's not God Hand.
[23:21.18]It's even worse.
[23:27.03]Eat the disk.
[23:33.23]Open Confidence is a flimsy shield.
[23:35.86]Don't worry.
[23:36.52]It's way fucking worse.
[23:39.28]No, don't turn the web... Get the webcam off.
[23:49.86]This is even fucking worse.
[23:53.34]This is what we're ending the stream on, by the way.
[24:13.41]Fucking naughty bear.
[24:19.13]This is the end of the stream.
[24:22.95]Why am I doing this rather than the quality singing?
[24:25.17]Because it's embarrassing.
[24:28.58]Like, singing on camera is embarrassing.
[24:30.58]It just is.
[24:31.06]It doesn't matter.
[24:32.02]I did one song that I was confident and that I knew I could do.
[24:36.06]And then I got a curveball thrown at me and it was embarrassing for me, so I stopped.
[24:49.77]Every day we stray further away from God's light.
[24:59.91]It looks cute, but it's violent.
[25:01.05]Don't you all get how subversive this is?
[25:04.46]Don't listen to the haters.
[25:06.50]I'm one of them.
[25:07.26]I'm one of the haters.
[25:08.16]Don't you?
[25:08.46]That's what you understand.
[25:11.30]Just so you understand, I'm one of the haters.
[25:15.36]I heard myself hit one of those notes and voice crack and I was like, get this off my screen.
[25:25.11]R Fuckface.
[25:26.33]Oh god.
[25:30.40]God Hand is good, is it really?
[25:31.60]You're on top of R Fuckface, congrats.
[25:37.20]Oh, that's great!
[25:39.34]Ready for Conker's Bad Fur Day?
[25:41.77]But not Conker's Bad Fur Day?
[25:43.07]Who's this?
[25:43.75]Oh look, it's Naughty Bear!
[25:46.67]Hello, Naughty Bear.
[25:49.93]What's this, Naughty Bear?
[25:51.66]What are they doing?
[25:54.00]Is this what we're going out on?
[25:55.18]Tools on the internet.
[25:56.22]That's why I didn't want to do it.
[26:15.19]I'm so self-aware that it like hurts me.
[26:17.89]Don't put me on the internet.
[26:18.89]Don't do it.
[26:19.29]Don't put me on the internet.
[26:20.65]You can make fun of me here, but don't put me on the internet.
[26:23.36]It's different.
[26:23.78]It's a lot different.
[26:24.48]It's different places.
[26:25.50]Did you make that for Daddles?
[26:44.67]Again, this is another achievement in video games.
[26:48.89]This is a video game achievement.
[26:55.81]What the fuck is this?
[26:58.70]How do I hurt someone?
[27:09.58]How do you hurt somebody?
[27:10.89]Isn't that what this game is?
[27:12.81]Oh, hurt someone.
[27:25.50]Destroy a gift.
[27:26.74]How do you destroy the gift?
[27:30.34]What?
[27:32.76]Please don't air this episode.
[27:34.02]It doesn't represent me.
[27:37.06]That's true.
[27:44.13]Did I just pull the cord out of the toilet?
[27:50.03]Apparently I did.
[27:56.67]Dude, when I make my video game, it's not going to be anything like this, I promise.
[28:07.45]Somebody's suspicious.
[28:08.31]I don't understand.
[28:11.78]It's naughty time!
[28:35.31]This is bad.
[28:36.86]This is really bad.
[28:37.74]That guy has a weapon.
[28:45.90]That guy has a knife.
[28:49.18]Why wouldn't you fight me back?
[28:54.37]I'm just getting into the boat.
[28:56.89]I just had a kill icon there.
[28:58.15]Hold on.
[28:58.61]Wait, give me that.
[29:00.47]There we go.
[29:00.89]Now I can kill someone.
[29:05.30]There's a guy getting in a boat.
[29:07.78]This guy over here is in a boat.
[29:09.00]How do I get down there?
[29:13.52]Not on my watch.
[29:14.54]Not on my watch!
[29:22.55]Okay, what's more like cringe inducing?
[29:30.63]Me singing on the voice or the naughty bear game?
[29:36.94]I'm not sure.
[29:38.24]That's pretty close.
[29:40.00]That is a close call.
[29:44.06]Annihilation!
[29:49.97]One person said singing on the voice, so... I'm gonna trust that person.
[30:01.72]This game, seriously.
[30:04.26]I've said this before, but man, like, you could've built a school.
[30:09.36]You could've, like, renovated a school.
[30:14.25]Instead, you made Naughty Bear Gold Edition.
[30:21.11]Donating like four million dollars to give like a fucking high school a new planetarium No, we're gonna make naughty bear Okay, we got
[30:57.01]That's going to be it for tonight.
[31:01.39]That's it.
[31:01.75]That's it for tonight.
[31:02.53]I will see you guys this weekend.
[31:09.18]Not on Tuesday.
[31:10.08]I'm going to stream this weekend.
[31:12.56]Oh, there are plenty of games left, but we don't want to blow all of it immediately.
[31:21.95]Thank you for watching.
[31:23.51]Appreciate it.
[31:26.28]We've got some Darkest Dungeon to play this weekend.
[31:29.90]I want to try to... I want to try on, like, Sunday.
[31:34.07]I'm not sure if off-stream, if I'm gonna try to, um... To level some people up, maybe?
[31:39.23]I don't know.
[31:39.99]But I do want to try to attempt, like, at least some of the high-end content in Darkest Dungeon.
[31:46.89]Just for fun.
[31:47.74]Just to try.
[31:48.16]You know what I mean?
[31:49.74]Oh, no, you broke the grill.
[31:52.00]Coulda fuckin' gave a school a planetarium.
[31:55.26]With the money that made this grill.
[31:56.72]At least I think so.
[32:01.26]Post a book or you have to read it next stream.
[32:04.62]No.
[32:08.30]You stayed up too far.
[32:09.06]I'm not going to put the rat movie on.
[32:13.34]I love that movie.
[32:14.20]I love the second one.
[32:14.96]And I love the third one.
[32:16.50]I love the third one.
[32:17.74]That you'll see at some point here.
[32:21.43]Doesn't mean we should watch it right now.
[32:26.85]I'm going to assume somewhere around Sunday.
[32:28.89]Sunday, like, afternoon, evening.
[32:31.07]We'll do some more Darkest Dungeon.
[32:34.72]But that's going to wrap it up for tonight.
[32:37.00]I'm kind of tired.
[32:37.94]I'm ready for bed.
[32:40.14]It's about like a four-hour stream.
[32:41.36]Alright, hold on a second.
[32:50.83]Ready?
[32:51.01]Watch this.
[33:02.38]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[33:11.81]Alright, goodnight everybody.
[33:12.73]Thanks for watching.
[33:15.41]I will see you guys on Sunday, probably, for Darkest Dungeon.
[33:20.25]30 minutes stream?
[33:20.91]No, it was like 4 hours.
[33:27.17]Have a good night.
[33:28.35]Much love, everybody.
[33:29.41]I do want to get through some bits, though.
[33:30.57]There were some bits.
[33:33.08]Why is it over already?
[33:33.96]We've been going for like four and a half hours.
[33:35.28]Four hours or so, right?
[33:36.20]Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
[33:37.22]Like four hours and twenty minutes.
[33:41.09]I'm hungry and I'm tired.
[33:43.11]But very, very special thanks to... Obviously to... Obviously.
[33:48.79]Zero thanks for the bits.
[33:49.87]About half a year ago you said there were shirts coming.
[33:52.79]Did that go anywhere?
[33:54.27]Kind of.
[33:55.65]Kind of.
[33:57.13]Kind of.
[34:00.69]Kind of.
[34:02.03]So...
[34:05.59]Shirts.
[34:07.47]Shirts and merchandise.
[34:09.67]There is merchandise coming.
[34:13.13]I'm hoping that somewhere around Christmas time, there'll be merchandise.
[34:17.98]Because I want to sell a toothbrush.
[34:20.68]That's the next thing I want to sell.
[34:23.15]But trying to, like, sell custom fucking electric toothbrushes is excruciating.
[34:29.13]It's very difficult to, like, get a company to do this.
[34:32.48]So, I'm trying.
[34:34.44]I have a couple of people that are, like, working on it.
[34:36.90]But there'll be custom electric toothbrushes.
[34:40.04]That's, like, the next piece of merchandise.
[34:41.50]I mentioned it before, but that's the next thing coming.
[34:44.12]Yeah.
[34:44.84]The fucking toothbrush.
[34:48.44]But yes.
[34:49.59]Thank you, Spotty, for the bits.

[34:57.15]Referencing the singing stream.
[35:00.81]Well, my day job is... I don't have a day job.
[35:06.37]My day job is like going to the bathroom.
[35:08.54]Takes me a long time.
[35:09.68]Anybody else take a long time in the bathroom?
[35:12.28]You know how it is.
[35:14.23]Like, I could probably get paid for the amount of time it takes me to use the bathroom.
[35:19.55]I probably could.
[35:20.91]But thank you, Purple.
[35:22.41]Thank you, Green Luther, for the bits.

[35:42.17]Is that somebody I look like?
[35:43.19]I don't know.
[35:43.89]But thank you for the bits, by the way.
[35:46.55]Uh, Vanta, thank you, Vanta, for the 10 bucks.
[35:49.49]I've waited weeks for this, and we only got to do two songs because I got too embarrassed.
[35:54.98]I was too embarrassed.
[36:00.22]He hopes he doesn't die happy.
[36:01.32]He wants him to die sad.
[36:03.00]I hope you don't die happy.
[36:04.24]No, no, no.
[36:05.56]Like, I hope you don't die.
[36:07.08]I hope you don't die.
[36:10.50]Come on, don't construe my words.
[36:13.39]I dropped my phone on the ground.
[36:19.35]But thank you, Vanta.

[36:33.50]I am thou, thou art I. Thou hast acquired a new vow that shall become the wings of rebellion.
[36:38.68]I'm not reading any more song lyrics.
[36:42.28]No, don't.
[36:43.42]Like, hashtag charity, good.
[36:44.76]Thank you for the hashtag charity.
[36:46.98]Muse for the 15 dollars.
[36:50.58]With the birth of a compact streamer persona, I have obtained the winds of... No.
[36:55.94]No.
[36:58.15]Persona 5 lyrics?
[37:00.71]What does that mean?
[37:02.01]It's not song lyrics?
[37:06.38]That's from Persona 5.
[37:12.60]Whatever.
[37:13.27]Thank you.
[37:15.03]CL Hammer, thank you for the $7.
[37:17.68]Is that Robin Akin-Downs?
[37:18.80]He really is everything.
[37:20.12]He was in everything between the years of like 2006 to like 2011.
[37:26.53]Robin Akin-Downs was in every single video game.
[37:30.03]It's crazy.
[37:30.86]He's a talented, very fucking talented guy.
[37:34.86]But thank you for the seven bucks.
[37:36.00]Completely original meme.
[37:38.44]Thank you for the $15.
[37:40.70]Thanks for always keeping me entertained.
[37:42.02]This really helps my mind.
[37:44.44]Keeps my mind off the hurricane.
[37:45.88]Thanks, Jeremy.
[37:46.48]Well, stay safe.
[37:48.42]I know that, like, Florida right now is now seeing, what, Irma?
[37:52.08]That's fucking terrifying.
[37:54.44]Hopefully you're safe.
[37:55.77]Or if you were part of Harvey, hopefully that you and your family and your friends are okay.
[38:00.45]But please be safe.
[38:03.25]Thank you for the 15 bucks.
[38:10.85]Thank you, everybody.
[38:15.17]I'll see you on Tuesday for a scheduled stream.
[38:18.65]If you don't want to watch Darkest Dungeon, I'm going to play quite a bit of it probably on Sunday.
[38:23.62]And we'll hang out.
[38:24.12]We'll chill.
[38:25.52]Got plenty of PS3 games to play left.
[38:27.16]And Cuphead comes out in like a couple weeks.
[38:29.80]Etalyx and I are going to absolutely grind the fuck out of that game.
[38:33.49]Should be a lot of fun.
[38:36.73]Good night.
[38:37.35]Good luck.
[38:38.47]Take care, everybody.
[38:39.51]See you soon.
