[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.50]Did it fucking work?
[00:19.88]What the hell was that?
[00:20.99]I don't know why it reverted back to 720p for no reason.
[00:36.30]Output, scaled resolution.
[00:38.60]1536 by 864 selected.
[00:41.12]Done.
[00:42.82]No, I had to click on use custom resolution, put in a custom one, hit apply, and then hit done.
[00:51.45]But there's a drop-down menu where I can select it.
[00:55.17]I hate this fucking program with a passion.
[00:57.27]It's like one of three programs that exist to stream on.
[01:00.01]You have three choices.
[01:02.11]Curly, Moe, and Larry.
[01:07.73]Alright, anyways, hi guys.
[01:13.53]How's everybody doing?
[01:18.48]Which one is this?
[01:19.30]I don't know.
[01:19.66]Now you're gonna ask me to go extreme on like the Nvidia fucking Shadowplay.
[01:29.99]I'm not gonna do that.
[01:31.15]That's not gonna happen.
[01:37.02]I was doing fine until I had to restart my stream, fucking, and give notifications to people that it just dumped on a bunch of people and they all saw no stream.
[01:44.86]Fucking real happy about that.
[01:55.77]YouTube streaming's made.
[01:57.55]No, no YouTube streaming.
[02:05.91]I bet Jerm's playing this on easy baby mode.
[02:08.10]I'm playing it on sti- Listen to my voice.
[02:10.04]I'm cured.
[02:14.18]Not 900p.
[02:15.16]You know, actually, you're not supposed to stream at 900p.
[02:17.56]I did some research.
[02:22.67]It's actually kind of- It's actually a little worse.
[02:25.37]Something to do with how, like, the pixels get broadcasted or something.
[02:28.31]I don't know.
[02:29.89]Anyways, why does everything have to start with so- Like, I swear to God.
[02:33.71]Like, everything just starts so negatively.
[02:37.13]Why doesn't shit just work?
[02:39.15]It's 964, not 864.
[02:40.19]Yeah, well, whatever.
[02:55.91]Did you remember to get the FOV mod?
[02:57.41]I didn't get the FOV mod because I've been playing the game at 81 FOV the whole time.
[03:02.36]And I've gotten used to it already.
[03:04.74]So... I'm just going to play the way the developers intended.
[03:09.06]The 20... Never mind.
[03:11.12]I don't want to get into this.
[03:12.46]No, we're not starting every stream with, like, I'm angry.
[03:15.88]That can't happen.
[03:16.98]But just it somehow happens that every time I start a stream, something annoying happens.
[03:21.22]Every time!
[03:27.72]We're gonna continue.
[03:28.52]No, don't blame me.
[03:33.85]Blame our annoying world we live in.
[03:35.87]It's not me.
[03:36.55]It's our annoying world.
[03:47.77]It's our society.
[03:51.20]Angry.
[03:52.04]Angsty.
[03:52.64]I'm not angsty.
[03:53.78]I'm fine.
[03:59.66]I'm like a can of soda.
[04:03.08]You understand?
[04:07.04]Like, when you open up a can of soda, like, a bunch of fucking, like, rage air comes out of it.
[04:12.91]And it tastes really, really good for, like, 20 minutes.
[04:17.17]After, like, an hour or two of the soda sitting there, it's gross.
[04:22.85]Don't shake me up, either.
[04:23.99]Don't shake me up!
[04:31.50]Wait, doesn't that imply to stop watching the stream after like 30 minutes?
[04:43.28]Don't do that.
[04:44.84]Stay.
[04:57.47]Next game?
[04:58.07]What?
[04:58.39]No.
[04:59.79]I'm playing Resident Evil Village.
[05:05.93]Yeah, after 30 minutes.
[05:06.85]Alright, so what did we leave off?
[05:16.37]How did I get a beard in one day?
[05:17.57]I think this was here yesterday.
[05:18.67]It was just dark.
[05:23.40]Planned your whole day around this stream?
[05:25.28]I didn't even tweet this stream was live.
[05:29.98]Did I?
[05:30.70]No, I didn't.
[05:32.38]Did I?
[05:34.24]Did I?
[05:34.82]No, there's no tweet.
[05:42.27]I hope everyone's doing well.
[05:43.01]I hope you're having a good day.
[05:43.77]I know we went for... No, I can't do that transition.
[05:46.96]It doesn't work like that.
[05:54.68]Hey, how is everybody doing?
[05:55.42]Hope you're having a great day.
[05:57.32]Yeah, good to see you.
[06:00.11]You can't start that angry and be like, oh, hey, by the way, how's your day?
[06:11.17]Finishing RE Village.
[06:13.01]Somebody said I have really boring tweets.
[06:16.86]I mean, I don't even use Twitter.
[06:19.46]Okay, here we go.
[06:32.39]Boring tweets.
[06:35.45]What else do I have to tell you?
[06:38.84]So if I'm, okay, if I'm playing Resident Evil Village today, like, I'm playing Resident Evil Village right now, come on over if you want to, right?
[06:48.30]Why do I have to have, like, a bunch of, like, fucking, like, emojis and shit?
[06:53.01]And, like, I don't know, like, dancing gifs.
[06:54.75]Like, I don't, I'm just, I'm live right now.
[06:57.41]Come watch or don't.
[07:00.67]Should I, you know what, I'm, here, how about this, ready?
[07:04.39]Let's do an experiment.
[07:05.01]Let's see how many more engagements I get.
[07:06.35]I want someone to clip this and gif it.
[07:09.81]I mean like I gotta have like a cool like I'm going live tweet right like And then like loop that and I'll use it tomorrow I'm not tomorrow next week Going live you're gonna show up that was terrible doesn't have to be good.
[07:32.46]Oh
[07:44.27]He said the exit's underwater.
[07:47.67]Lazy comedy?
[07:49.87]No, it's just like I just tell you that I'm alive.
[07:52.53]I don't have to do anything else.
[07:57.72]That's visible regret.
[08:00.55]Not really.
[08:00.93]Alright, so where are we going?
[08:04.09]Underwater.
[08:04.55]Those of you that didn't see the stream yesterday, we got to a point.
[08:08.39]We got to three out of the four pieces of a thing.
[08:13.45]And if you haven't seen any of the game, this is a spoiler.
[08:16.54]So if you don't want to get spoiled in Resident Evil Village, then I suggest you close your ears.
[08:23.91]This is like my daughter's body.
[08:27.17]Okay.
[08:27.83]I'm on the third piece right now.
[08:29.47]We got it, but it's not the end.
[08:30.79]We have to go through this weird puke guy that falls in the river.
[08:33.73]Double audio.
[08:36.85]Are you lying?
[08:42.86]Might have an audio problem.
[08:45.02]What happened?
[08:48.34]I don't have any drop frames.
[08:49.70]Looks good on my end.
[08:50.98]Did something happen?
[08:53.21]I have zero drop frames for now.
[08:54.37]Alright, so, uh, we... This is, like, the swamp level.
[09:03.43]And I got a... I have a code here.
[09:06.67]This is the code.
[09:07.61]It's three red, one, two, three, tic-tac-toe.
[09:11.53]And then two blue.
[09:13.43]And then solid blue top right.
[09:15.27]So, I'll... Somebody will screenshot that and just give it to me later.
[09:17.67]That's good.
[09:19.21]You can hear the audio twice?
[09:20.23]It's echoing.
[09:26.17]The game is echoing.
[09:31.37]Game audio is weird, is it?
[09:35.81]Game audio.
[09:38.75]How would that be happening?
[09:45.02]Oh, am I getting trolled?
[09:46.46]Why are you doing this to me?
[09:48.76]It's fine.
[09:49.28]Hold on, let me do a test.
[09:55.32]We good?
[09:56.56]It's not one guy?
[09:57.32]It's fine.
[10:00.73]Okay.
[10:00.95]Alright.
[10:01.23]Maude just said it's fine.
[10:02.05]I'm going.
[10:11.69]Perfectly fine.
[10:12.31]It's fine.
[10:12.75]Okay.
[10:13.01]Alright.
[10:13.25]Alright.
[10:13.55]Alright.
[10:13.81]Why is White Wolf doing this?
[10:20.21]Alright, so I gotta go down.
[10:21.93]Exit's underwater.
[10:22.58]I gotta drain the water.
[10:24.38]So the question is now go... Oh, that way.
[10:26.66]Because of the chicken.
[10:27.52]Yep.
[10:27.80]Okay.
[10:28.12]Alright, alright.
[10:28.44]I know where I'm going.
[10:29.00]I know what I'm doing.
[10:31.64]We like to do a little bit of trolling here in this community.
[10:38.33]It's literally not fine.
[10:40.47]I cannot think of a reason why this would be happening though.
[10:44.55]It's actually definitely echoing.
[10:53.37]It's doubled?
[11:03.92]Done.
[11:10.08]It's not like playing my stream in the background, right?
[11:12.82]No.
[11:20.17]Is your stream muted in the other window?
[11:21.57]Yeah, yeah, it should be fine.
[11:22.97]I don't know why, that's really weird.
[11:25.47]It's the game audio doing it.
[11:26.85]Let me see.
[11:30.55]It's not actually a troll.
[11:31.79]It sounds like the audio is going through a fan.
[11:36.03]It's got a weird echo effect.
[11:37.65]It only sounds fine because it's a sound effect not spoken.
[11:40.82]When Ethan spoke right at the beginning, it was noticeably weird.
[11:51.72]I'm so confused.
[11:52.46]Nothing changed from yesterday besides... Talk to Duke to confirm it.
[11:58.85]Alright, yeah.
[11:59.63]That's really strange.
[12:00.55]I don't know why this would be happening.
[12:04.47]Um... Let me go... Hold on.
[12:20.11]How's that?
[12:20.75]It's there.
[12:24.69]It's kind of weird.
[12:25.35]What the fuck is it doing?
[12:54.26]Let me restart the game and see what happens.
[12:59.78]It's like metallic?
[13:02.01]Yeah, let me just restart it.
[13:02.91]Because I don't hear that, though.
[13:05.73]It sounds normal to me.
[13:06.55]It sounds like he's talking inside of a pipe.
[13:14.05]Oh, let me see.
[13:16.15]We deleted links.
[13:19.03]Yeah, that sounds perfectly normal to me.
[13:21.38]Let me restart the game.
[13:22.76]Hold on, give me one sec.
[13:24.87]Give me one second.
[13:43.46]Sounds cool.
[13:44.14]You should leave it.
[13:44.88]This is very strange.
[13:48.97]sounds like it's being piped into obs twice like we're getting desktop and also a separate input for the game like a capture card let me listen to it hold on that's really weird as you wish what the is going on what that's so weird why is that happening
[14:15.61]Yeah, it's playing twice.
[14:17.39]The audio is playing twice.
[14:20.60]Right next to each other, but nothing is doing that.
[14:22.56]Hold on, let me see.
[14:27.76]The only thing pulling audio is the GoXLR, and the routing on the GoXLR is... Okay, so now I'm pulling myself in here, okay?
[14:37.60]So that shouldn't be happening.
[14:41.59]This is so weird.
[14:45.33]Okay, I'm gonna try to pull it through one more time and see if it fixes it.
[14:50.69]I cannot think of a solution as to why this would be happening.
[14:52.75]Let's try it again, hold on.
[14:57.95]The only thing that changed is I changed it to... I moved my OBS settings to make it so it would stream at 864 and I made my CPU preset slower so it would look better.
[15:10.01]That's the only thing I did.
[15:15.20]Let me, hold on, let me just confirm something with you guys right now.
[15:17.24]I'm gonna, like, play a sound effect.
[15:19.99]Tell me if it sounds weird.
[15:21.53]Ready?
[15:24.09]Like, did that sound weird?
[15:31.89]Was that echoed at all or anything?
[15:33.37]That one sounds fine.
[15:36.93]So why would, so when, hold on, maybe it was just a Resident Evil problem.
[15:40.92]Let's try this again.
[15:42.52]Oh, sorry, the technical fucking problem's Andy.
[15:47.48]Use a different sound effect.
[15:56.91]Okay.
[15:57.13]I'll try a different sound effect.
[16:05.43]Well, that one has reverb on it.
[16:08.09]That doesn't help us.
[16:09.36]That one has reverb.
[16:10.72]That one has echo.
[16:16.31]How about just like, I don't know, like man talking?
[16:28.00]Okay, how about or just like punch sound?
[16:32.61]This would do it, right?
[16:40.59]How's that?
[16:56.57]It auto-played.
[16:57.51]Hold on.
[17:00.93]Oh shit!
[17:01.87]Alright, I got the problem.
[17:03.23]I know what the problem is.
[17:04.42]I got it.
[17:04.88]Problem is done.
[17:05.82]Problem has been solved.
[17:06.64]I figured it out.
[17:07.40]We're okay.
[17:08.20]Everybody's fine.
[17:09.14]We're gonna play Resident Evil Village now.
[17:11.18]Problem has been figured out.
[17:12.66]I got it.
[17:14.44]I should got it.
[17:15.54]Let's see.
[17:16.04]There it is.
[17:19.74]Okay, we're good.
[17:31.09]The problem was, for some reason, it was pulling my audio twice.
[17:33.90]I don't know why this shit happens.
[17:38.46]I'm as confused as you guys are.
[17:39.96]Trust me.
[17:45.00]That absolutely fixed it.
[17:46.90]No way.
[17:47.42]No chance that it didn't.
[17:55.91]Okay, let's come back.
[17:58.29]Hello.
[17:59.79]Hi.
[18:00.73]We should be good to go.
[18:01.47]I don't think I've ever- I don't- Have I ever- Have I ever had a normal fucking stream?
[18:07.37]Like, has a stream ever started normally?
[18:10.69]Ever.
[18:11.69]Every stream, it's always like something weird happens, or like I'm fucking mad at everything.
[18:17.03]There's never been a normal start to a stream.
[18:19.07]I have to get- I have to get normal.
[18:22.33]I have to have a normal start to a stream.
[18:23.79]Like, hi guys, how's everybody doing?
[18:25.59]Mm-hmm.
[18:27.69]Resident Evil Village Part 2 incoming here.
[18:33.25]Here we are.
[18:33.65]We were at the gatehouse last time.
[18:37.08]Because you're not normal.
[18:42.86]Yes, I am.
[18:46.14]I am.
[18:49.33]How dare you say that?
[19:01.62]Did it fix it?
[19:02.56]We're good, I think, yeah.
[19:07.24]Get to the game already.
[19:10.50]I'm trying, man!
[19:12.14]I'm sorry!
[19:12.84]Alright, let's go.
[19:15.44]It's been 20 fucking minutes!
[19:17.71]I hate my streamer ability!
[19:19.47]Alright, let's go.
[19:24.59]No, wrong way.
[19:25.35]Don't be normal.
[19:31.93]Well, sometimes I have to be.
[19:33.65]Like, for instance, I got a job interview.
[19:36.57]I just wish that one stream would start where I don't, like, curse out a company.
[19:43.76]You know what's wicked funny?
[19:45.52]Last night I was lying in bed.
[19:47.63]And I said to myself, I said, you know what?
[19:50.19]I'm not going to like curse any more companies anymore.
[19:52.77]I'm just going to like just, you know, if I'm annoyed, I'll just be annoyed.
[19:55.58]Cursed out a company the first fucking five seconds of the stream.
[19:57.68]I actually cursed a company out and then turned the stream off and came back.
[20:04.18]I already have the crank.
[20:04.92]I think I do, right?
[20:07.02]Yeah.
[20:10.31]Oh, no, no, no.
[20:10.97]I did not.
[20:11.69]I did this part after.
[20:12.81]So, I got the crank.
[20:16.23]I broke the crank off.
[20:17.11]I said, well, that's annoying, right?
[20:21.36]So, I said, get to the second windmill.
[20:22.86]So, we're going to try to get to the second windmill.
[20:25.50]We're normal.
[20:26.12]I'm normal today.
[20:27.08]Somebody just gave 10 community.
[20:27.94]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[20:28.98]Appreciate it.
[20:29.42]That was from Void.
[20:31.66]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[20:33.14]10 of them.
[20:35.66]That's a lot of money.
[20:36.18]Thank you.
[20:37.54]Well, part of my own, this is, uh... I'm just gonna say, I'm gonna say Igor.
[20:42.50]And then maybe you'll know what that means.
[20:44.80]I got that.
[20:46.46]And I had to find a way to the second windmill.
[20:49.49]I'm gonna be normal today.
[20:50.45]No, like, fucking weird movements.
[20:52.45]No, like, screaming and shit.
[20:54.55]No cursing out Fortune 500 companies.
[20:58.85]Take me off the guest list of every fucking exclusive party I could ever be invited to.
[21:02.95]No more of that.
[21:03.91]I'm normal today.
[21:14.31]I'm going to try to go inside, right?
[21:16.37]Go in and then down?
[21:17.05]Alright, here we go.
[21:19.09]I'm normal today.
[21:22.28]Don't listen to them.
[21:23.18]Don't listen to all... Thank you, Cat Sum, for the five community subs.
[21:31.14]Here comes a joke.
[21:31.90]No, I'm going to be normal.
[21:37.93]I wanted to so badly do a beat to that, but that would not be normal, now would it?
[21:47.33]Alright, let's make a little friendly bet here.
[21:49.55]Let's see how long I can be normal.
[21:51.33]Like, just normal.
[21:54.07]I'm gonna try to go for 10 minutes of just normal.
[21:57.29]No, nothing.
[21:57.87]Just be a fucking normal person.
[21:59.75]Just sit here and play a game.
[22:00.89]10 minutes, starting now.
[22:08.72]Ooh, cool.
[22:10.74]Oh, does it look better?
[22:11.72]That's another question I have.
[22:14.96]How much better does the stream look?
[22:18.59]Does it look good?
[22:19.65]Better than yesterday?
[22:21.69]Looks about the same.
[22:26.64]Looks a little bit better.
[22:27.98]A bit better.
[22:28.76]Same.
[22:29.64]Not as good as you.
[22:30.72]Thanks.
[22:34.76]Okay, let me keep walking.
[22:38.88]Ooh, we can break that.
[22:42.18]Normal's boring.
[22:43.36]Let me just see if I can... I lost!
[22:52.19]Holy shit!
[22:56.88]Ah!
[23:04.34]Wait, I died?
[23:05.26]Wait, that was it?
[23:14.77]I got really scared and I looked in the camera and I realized that was being weird so I just made it- I- okay.
[23:19.50]I made it extra weird.
[23:22.03]I was like, I looked over, I turned, I saw like in the preview over here how weird I looked.
[23:27.13]And then I was like, I'll add some weirdness to it because I already lost.
[23:38.23]Lost to normal wheel.
[23:39.83]Alright, so just don't get eaten.
[23:42.04]That's easier said than done.
[23:43.04]Hurry up and run!
[23:47.58]Alright, is there a place I can hide?
[23:51.31]I don't know where to go.
[23:52.41]This way?
[23:57.67]Where the?
[23:58.25]Where am I?
[23:59.86]Where do I go?
[24:05.58]Ah!

[24:11.68]What does that do?
[24:12.56]Oh my god.
[24:13.05]He's gonna jump and kill me.
[24:18.33]Ah!
[24:18.55]Ah!
[24:28.22]Can I go?
[24:28.66]Oh my god.
[24:32.78]Where's the ladder?
[24:37.34]What's hap- I don't understand what's going on.
[24:39.94]Where's the ladder?
[24:40.50]Do I have to knock it down?
[24:47.92]Why is this not going down?
[24:55.32]On the other side.
[24:59.21]Go to the other side.
[25:03.45]Oh, fuck you, game.
[25:06.22]There's 50 subs?
[25:07.42]I missed 50 subs.
[25:08.52]Well, thank you.
[25:29.07]Tuber voice.
[25:29.75]No, that was a tuber face.
[25:31.22]Alright, come on.
[25:32.20]Let's go.
[25:32.72]Oh, I changed to E, right.
[25:40.38]Alright, get out of the way.
[25:47.23]Shit!
[25:55.60]I had to go the other way.
[26:01.14]Just restart.
[26:02.32]I thought I could get there fast.
[26:03.40]I thought I could get there before he did it.
[26:06.02]Who gave the 50 subs?
[26:08.33]I only gave 50 community subs.
[26:09.51]I need to know who it was.
[26:10.17]Don't go on the planks.
[26:47.15]Okay, wait, he's going to do a big jump.
[26:52.46]Okay, now he's going to come this way and then run around.
[26:57.60]What the fuck?
[26:59.12]Wait, I didn't know.
[27:03.60]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[27:06.64]Excuse me.
[27:07.28]Excuse me.

[27:11.56]I'm good.
[27:25.12]Okay.
[27:25.80]I keep pressing F because I changed it to E. Oh, God.
[27:34.47]Just hide.
[27:35.87]You can't get me through here.
[27:36.67]Okay.
[27:52.62]How many more?
[27:53.12]I have to do more of those?
[27:54.64]Oh my god, what do I do?
[28:03.27]Down there, and then... What the hell is all that?
[28:16.51]Oh my god, I hate this.
[28:18.33]Are you kidding me?
[28:28.42]Okay, hold on.
[28:29.44]I'm gonna see if I can get to a safe place.
[28:30.66]Okay, he's gonna- he jumps there.
[28:35.06]And then, so if I go that way, how am I gonna walk anywhere?
[28:40.66]Is there a- can I go in?

[28:49.31]Cl- Do it!
[28:56.35]This is so stressful.
[29:10.25]Where is he?
[29:12.83]Hey, don't turn.
[29:13.41]No, no.
[29:13.63]Turn it back on.
[29:14.23]Turn it back on.
[29:21.50]Normal.
[29:24.40]In that hut?
[29:28.86]Alright, we get out of the way.
[29:29.94]Okay.
[29:38.24]There's another box I have to pull?
[29:41.07]Oh my god, I hate this part.
[29:47.11]I hate this.
[29:51.59]Thank god I get to start here, though.
[29:52.95]Alright, pull this, wait, and then... I think I have to bait out a jump, right?
[30:00.98]Bait a jump out?
[30:09.95]Alright, go!
[30:27.56]I'm so- I don't know where he is!
[30:28.62]What happened?
[30:41.45]I can fall in the water?
[30:46.78]Platforms will- Yeah, I know the platforms drop, but I didn't- Wait, why-
[31:13.78]Okay, so it's turn on blue one, run back to house.
[31:19.28]Turn on blue one, run back to house.
[31:22.62]Turn on orange one, run back to house.
[31:30.19]Wait, go.
[31:32.35]Turn on blue one again, run.
[31:37.01]Where's this fucking white one?
[31:39.37]What?
[31:39.89]Oh god.
[31:49.61]I'm dead.
[31:49.87]Oh my god, how am I still alive?
[31:58.63]It was... Why did I fall through?
[32:04.45]This is... It's not hard.
[32:10.13]It's not hard.
[32:11.27]It's... Don't say it.
[32:13.67]I'm not mad today.
[32:14.86]I'm a normal guy.
[32:35.73]Do it!
[32:59.56]Don't have to go back?
[33:00.56]The last time I tried just to go forward, he killed me instantly.
[33:10.97]Here we go.
[33:33.25]Ah!
[33:46.54]No one's ever died this much at this part.
[33:50.84]Are you sure?
[33:53.22]Just go.
[33:53.52]So you're telling me just go.
[33:55.80]Okay, go.
[33:56.20]So you're telling me he's not going to kill me right here.
[34:00.96]I'm going to stay alive right here.
[34:04.10]I can't believe that just happened.
[34:05.16]I can't believe it.
[34:05.62]I don't believe you.
[34:06.42]I don't fucking believe you.
[34:07.58]He jumps up and eats you and shit.
[34:09.92]He jumps up and eats your body and he eats your brains and shit and he kills you.
[34:21.83]Oh my god, I have to press them when they go.
[34:23.20]Oh my god, I can't do this part.
[34:24.34]I'm fucking so stupid, I can't do it.
[34:26.90]I can't, I have to, I get it.
[34:27.86]I have to keep pressing them.
[34:28.66]I have to keep pressing them as they, I have to keep pressing them as they happen.
[34:33.22]I have to keep pressing them as they happen.
[34:34.54]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[34:36.46]What's Resident Evil about this, by the way? ...

[36:30.87]What just happened?
[36:32.73]Did I win?
[36:33.13]Did I win?
[36:36.53]Did I do it?
[36:41.74]Just pretending for content.
[36:44.68]You haven't been to this channel for very long if you think that's real.
[37:07.48]Those are some big burps.
[37:32.24]This guy, this is the guy that beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[37:36.64]Guys, I can play Dark Souls.
[37:39.26]Because Dark Souls is just three buttons.
[37:42.04]Attack and dodge.
[37:45.74]And, like, run.
[37:47.12]I can do those very well.
[37:57.79]Hey!
[37:58.07]Hey!
[38:08.09]What?
[38:09.47]Oh, Jonat!
[38:13.63]This game has three buttons too.

[38:15.27]It's W. It's shift.
[38:16.21]It's A. It's space.
[38:17.29]It's right click.
[38:17.93]It's left click.

[38:20.49]It's right.
[38:20.85]It's up and down.
[38:21.51]There's a mouse.
[38:22.11]There's a view.
[38:22.89]There's aiming.
[38:23.51]No, you're wrong.

[38:46.48]What?
[38:47.16]What happened?
[38:51.34]What's going on?
[38:54.59]What do I do?
[38:54.93]Do I have to crank?
[38:57.77]Let's crank it!
[39:01.51]Well, why did I take the crank out?
[39:05.66]Why would you remove the crank?

[40:22.15]No, crank.
[40:30.15]Okay.
[40:32.86]Alright, I did it.
[40:38.93]I turned all the windmills on.
[40:46.16]So now the gate's open.
[40:47.76]He's still alive, though.
[40:48.80]I still have to kill that guy.
[40:49.76]Alright, there's nothing else I can do here.
[40:55.02]No other items, nothing.
[40:57.39]Is this just to leave the area?
[40:58.53]I believe it is.
[40:59.27]Let's go.
[40:59.59]I already did everything over there.
[41:10.20]It's gonna be some motherfucker right here, I swear to God.
[41:12.46]Hi.
[41:15.36]What do we got here?
[41:25.79]I have 36,000 bucks.
[41:31.11]Should I upgrade something?
[41:33.72]Or just save it?
[41:41.47]I don't think I need it.
[41:42.95]I have four pipe bombs.
[41:43.73]I don't think I need any more.
[41:45.45]I'm good.
[41:45.79]Okay, so here we go.
[42:07.37]Red.
[42:10.07]Red.
[42:10.37]Okay, wait, what's 50 community subs?
[42:13.65]Void just gave 50.
[42:14.71]Void?
[42:15.03]80.
[42:16.48]Just gave 50 community subs.
[42:17.76]Is that who gave 50 before?
[42:20.84]Is that 100 community subs from Void?
[42:23.54]Or is it two different people?
[42:26.46]Void, what are you doing?
[42:31.42]50 more community subs from Void.
[42:33.48]That's too much money.
[42:35.66]Don't give me that kind of money.
[42:37.30]Thank you, though.
[42:38.71]No more.
[42:39.85]Don't give me any more of your money.
[42:47.75]That's an insane amount of money to give somebody.
[42:50.14]Thank you.
[42:53.04]Alright, so what's going on here?
[42:54.60]Am I missing a tile?
[43:15.73]Does the colors change depending on what's... Okay, hold on.
[43:18.39]I get it.
[43:18.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[43:19.33]Okay, so... How do I change this one in the middle?
[43:23.18]I can't select the one over here.
[43:29.66]So how do I make... Is it just blank?
[43:45.71]So easy.
[43:46.84]The paper is the wrong way.
[44:53.26]Blue, blue.
[44:54.08]Where's the other blue?
[45:03.42]Wait, that was another 50 subs?
[45:06.42]Don't give me any more of your money.
[45:07.92]Don't give me... I am demanding... I'm commanding you don't give me any more of your money.
[45:12.85]That's ridiculous.
[45:14.97]That's an absurd amount of money.
[45:17.89]This is like 150 community subs.
[45:19.87]I command you to stop.
[45:25.61]Thank you, though.
[45:26.07]That's fucking insane.
[45:27.31]I don't deserve that kind of money.
[45:29.05]Thank you.
[45:34.80]No, Void, thank you, though.
[45:36.02]Seriously.
[45:43.10]Looking at R2-D2 NPC?
[45:47.02]Oh, Red Dead Redemption 2.
[45:48.60]Wait, it is R2-D2, isn't it?
[45:50.24]Red Dead Redemption 2?
[45:57.41]Alright, now what?
[46:01.15]So that drains the water.
[46:03.15]Now I can head back out there and see what it does.
[46:06.75]Take a look.
[46:13.32]Where you going?
[46:29.49]God damn it.
[46:35.85]Ooh, what's this?
[46:37.53]On a sunny day... That's 200 community subs.
[46:45.35]Alright, Void.
[46:49.23]That's, this... We're gonna, we're gonna have to shut him down.
[46:53.45]We're gonna have to shut him down.
[46:56.22]That's 200 community subs you've given in the last 10 minutes.
[47:03.56]Thank you.
[47:04.22]That's crazy.
[47:06.64]Mother Miranda brought me five peoples from the village, just like I asked.
[47:12.12]I made them sleep with some liquid, and then I put kudu in their tummies.
[47:16.58]Looking forward to the kudu to grow in their tummies.
[47:20.93]Four of the people from the village are dead this morning.
[47:22.77]One is almost a lichen.
[47:24.89]I sent it to my lab on the mountain.
[47:26.57]I failed again.
[47:27.21]Mother wants strong vessels, but I cannot get any.
[47:29.35]I will need more people from the village.
[47:36.26]Ooh.
[47:37.38]Ooh!
[47:37.66]Stop stalling?
[47:45.61]I'm playing the game.
[47:46.47]What are you talking about?
[47:49.83]This game is fucking awesome, too, by the way.
[47:51.95]Let's be honest here.
[47:56.57]I'm actually very much enjoying this game.
[47:59.20]Contrary to all the things I've said negatively about it over and over again.
[48:06.56]Want more stuff though, no?
[48:07.86]Okay.
[48:09.70]Something blinked at me.
[48:13.98]Oh, I thought it was like a diamond or something.
[48:15.54]Alright, well this is where we actually fight this guy.
[48:23.43]Let's kick his ass.
[48:33.51]No!
[48:35.53]Mother!

[53:08.85]You're not gonna die, it's baby mode.
[53:11.33]It was acid rain.
[53:32.17]I thought it was gas.
[53:33.03]I thought it was, like, filling the area with, like, gas.
[53:35.49]I didn't know it was coming from above.
[53:36.53]I thought it was, like, permeating every surface like a gas.
[53:44.96]Alright, let's make sure I didn't miss anything.
[53:46.44]I burned through a lot of health there.
[53:48.40]So, not good, but, you know, whatever.
[53:50.38]Oh my fucking god.
[53:57.44]Alright, I don't even know what to do.
[53:59.59]This person keeps giving, like, fucking hundreds of dollars.
[54:05.15]Void, that's so much money.
[54:06.87]You gotta stop.
[54:07.77]Alright, let me look for items.
[54:21.24]Void.

[54:26.68]Thank you.
[54:27.04]That's crazy.
[54:29.45]You have given me more money than I would ever expect anyone to give a single solitary person that's an e-clown on the internet.
[54:36.03]So... You don't have to do that.
[54:51.50]I have to, like, get out of this.

[55:39.73]Hey, I know, I, I, hey, I, I know people, okay?
[55:44.51]Look, just because they're far more talented than I'll ever be doesn't mean I can't know them.

[56:27.39]I used to be on Newgrounds all the time.
[56:32.87]You'd be surprised at how many people have turned into like wild successes from like this old Newgrounds like board and section and a couple of like voice acting boards and stuff.
[56:45.78]It's...
[56:47.29]It's actually incredible.

[57:23.35]I know the famous people.
[57:24.65]You know what I mean?
[57:25.15]I'm like the guy in the entourage that, like, just knew the guys.

[57:43.62]I'm not famous.
[57:44.22]I'm not.
[57:46.58]You're more famous than most people.
[57:52.62]I don't think I'm famous.
[57:53.40]You're the sus guy.
[57:59.89]Yeah, the sus guy is not even me, though.
[58:01.39]The sus guy is just like a face of mine that's not even me.
[58:09.05]Top 100 streamer.
[58:15.37]Oh.
[58:16.50]No, don't tell me that.
[58:17.64]Top 100 streamer.
[58:18.50]No, don't say that.
[58:19.92]Oh.
[58:20.80]It's getting hot in here.
[58:21.62]Wow.
[58:23.12]No, you guys think I'm like the top 50, top 100?
[58:27.72]Don't think, am I?
[58:29.04]Alright, no, I don't care about how many people are here or not.
[58:35.97]I don't care how many fucking brand deals I don't have or do have.
[58:39.69]I don't care about anything, okay?
[58:43.29]All I give a shit about right now is getting angry at Capcom for you to laugh at me about my eyes turning red.
[58:53.49]That's all I care about right now.
[58:54.35]I don't care about anything else.
[59:01.68]Famous, not famous, known, unknown.
[59:04.28]I don't care, okay?
[59:06.51]I've just, I've been doing this for fucking 10 years.
[59:11.57]He loves the attention.
[59:18.04]I just, this is fun for me.
[59:19.44]Okay?
[59:21.16]And I told you guys when it's not fun anymore, I'll be done.
[59:24.78]But that hasn't happened yet.
[59:26.00]And whatever.
[59:26.86]I don't know.
[59:27.42]Why are we even talking about this?
[59:28.92]I'm not like accepting a fucking award.
[59:30.52]I just told you that I know like some voice actors.
[59:34.05]Stop making this about me.
[59:35.21]It has nothing to do with me.
[59:36.15]It has absolutely nothing to do with me.
[59:40.09]Congratulations.
[59:41.05]Thank you.
[59:42.53]Thanks.
[59:43.89]You mean that?
[59:44.39]Thank you.
[59:49.11]god damn it all this stemmed from you know what let this be a lesson for you all of you log into an invisible offline mode on Steam when you broadcast roughly a good idea mother miranda gave me a rose jar no one likes me which is why I thought they would leave me out again
[60:12.04]But Heisenberg said that was why we each get a rose.
[60:15.64]The ceremony cannot happen without us all there.
[60:17.92]Mother didn't seem to care, though.
[60:21.33]We all need a rose.
[60:22.49]We each get a rose.
[60:23.57]Mother said rose is a vessel.
[60:24.79]With a vessel, Mother can get her real child back.
[60:28.93]Even though she has been dead for a very long time.
[60:31.03]This is going to be a scenario where, like, I'm... Like, this is... Mother is just Mia.
[60:37.75]And this is, like, some weird twisted thing.
[60:39.59]Like...
[60:44.07]Even though she's been dead for a very long time.
[60:46.43]But if Mother does, then what will happen to me?
[60:49.39]I'm not her real child.
[60:50.49]Would she abandon me?
[60:51.33]No, I don't want that.
[60:53.15]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[60:58.92]Wrong.
[61:00.62]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[61:06.94]Mother...
[61:18.99]Anything on the TV?
[61:22.11]So, can I like take this key?
[61:26.25]Combined with the four-winged unborn key, you now have a six-winged unborn key.
[61:31.78]That was just like the highest level upgrade in an iPad game.
[61:36.24]Who's that?
[61:37.70]Oh, come on.
[61:39.04]We just met a while back.
[61:40.36]Nothing really matters.
[61:42.46]You're the last asshole in my way, aren't you?
[61:45.46]You've got fight.
[61:46.93]I'll give you that, Ethan.
[61:48.95]But what's the plan when you have all four flasks?
[61:53.10]What are you trying to get at?
[61:55.08]I could lend you a hand.
[61:57.22]Not trying to get on my good side?
[61:58.62]Don't get cocky.
[62:01.24]I'd kill you if you weren't worth the trouble.
[62:06.09]There's a stronghold not too far outside the village.
[62:09.69]Go there and get my flask.
[62:12.39]Do that, and you pass.
[62:15.61]First, head back to the graveyard.
[62:20.74]self-centered prick that sounds like me no he doesn't sounds like I sound like me chest over here somewhere alright where's this chest though out this way and around
[62:51.48]Sounds exactly like you.
[62:52.90]No, it doesn't.
[62:53.48]It doesn't sound anything like me.
[62:54.48]How do you think that sounds like me?
[62:57.42]And I need... Is there a typewriter in there that I didn't get?
[63:00.71]No.
[63:10.30]Treasure.
[63:12.44]I want the treasure chest that's over there.
[63:16.58]And I'm going to give it to him.
[63:28.55]You missed it.
[63:35.17]I do have an extended mag.
[63:35.99]You're right.
[63:36.35]Nice.
[64:08.01]I look at chat like every five seconds, and it's why I get killed every day.
[64:12.39]Every stream.
[64:13.03]Alright, cool.
[64:19.13]Back to where we were.
[64:19.99]Now... Did I miss out on that?
[64:23.92]Let's find out.
[64:31.14]She's killed every day.
[64:32.32]Okay.
[64:49.12]Can I get this chest from here?
[64:50.53]Uh... This dude's all the way up here.
[64:58.47]What was that?
[65:16.28]A mermaid ball!
[65:17.42]Ooh!
[65:17.88]This is a spherical ball!
[65:22.00]Oh, it's one of these.
[65:27.32]Where do I put that ball?
[65:28.24]I want the money.
[65:32.62]Dead?
[65:43.29]These guys drop really, really expensive shit.
[65:50.31]Like that.
[65:50.87]Crystal wing.
[65:51.47]I'll take it.
[65:51.89]What's down here?
[65:59.33]Wait, did I?
[65:59.79]Oh, no, no.
[66:00.11]This is where I just was.
[66:00.71]Okay.
[66:01.99]Wake up.
[66:02.53]Wake up, Jeremy.
[66:03.21]Wake up.
[66:06.69]I wake up and I'm in a coma, right?
[66:08.49]Wake up, you're in a coma, right?
[66:20.08]You're alive?
[66:20.88]What?
[66:22.61]No, don't die up there.
[66:23.61]I don't think I can reach it.
[66:24.35]Okay.
[66:35.63]Wake up, Jerma.
[66:36.27]Wake up.
[66:37.08]You've been in a coma for 20 years.
[66:38.68]Wake up.
[66:59.30]Wake up.
[67:09.24]Blink.
[67:09.88]Blink.
[67:10.52]Blink.
[67:10.82]Blink.
[67:11.06]Blink.
[67:12.36]Oh, I need to make health.
[67:13.08]Because I don't have any.
[67:14.44]I have one health pack.
[67:18.86]Make shotgun.
[67:21.76]And... Can I make mines?
[67:24.90]No.
[67:26.74]No, I should not.
[67:36.72]Ooh, there's a chest over here.
[67:37.92]Is this it?
[67:39.35]It's locked from the other side.
[67:40.95]This is it, right?
[67:48.47]Yes!
[67:48.71]You guys were saying I missed this.
[67:53.70]What are you talking about?
[68:09.48]I hear something.
[68:11.27]Mother Miranda gave me a mountain.
[68:13.15]Now I can do lots of Kadoo experiments.
[68:17.37]This is my secret special laboratory.
[68:19.01]I did three Kadoo experiments today, but they all went pop and made a mess.
[68:24.14]I put in the Kadoo and then tried putting wolf blood from a needle into the spine.
[68:27.98]The person wriggled a lot and then killed my assistant.
[68:31.38]I could not hold down, so I put it in a cage.
[68:33.26]Now I have to feed it.
[68:39.74]That's my favorite gun from Fistful of Frags.
[68:46.30]I love this thing.
[68:46.92]Let me rearrange.
[68:58.33]Hmm.
[69:01.71]I have too much shit in here.
[69:02.59]How much magnum ammo?
[69:05.47]I got five.
[69:11.77]Sniper rifle ammo.
[69:16.83]Handgun ammo.
[69:17.63]Alright, we gotta move this shit out of the way.
[69:19.11]Handgun ammo.
[69:24.40]Shotgun.
[69:25.52]Sniper rifle.
[69:26.76]Grenade launcher.
[69:27.74]Magnum.
[69:34.12]I'm gonna keep it down here because it's a rare usage.
[69:44.26]Anything that's only used sporadically.
[69:47.45]Goes down here.
[69:47.97]Okay.
[69:54.09]Better.
[69:55.05]I like it.
[69:56.45]Good.
[70:01.36]I can make shotgun ammo.
[70:02.72]No.
[70:02.98]I'm going to save it.
[70:07.82]Five shots.
[70:11.42]This is awesome.
[70:12.04]Alright.
[70:12.34]I love magnums in this game.
[70:18.34]The doll head that you sold was a combinable?
[70:20.30]I still have it.
[70:22.40]I didn't sell it.
[70:24.64]I got it.
[70:27.70]Magnum always sucks.
[70:28.62]What?
[70:29.92]Magnum's the most fun thing in Resident Evil, because you save it, you get like ten bullets for it, and you wait till the final boss, and you shoot the final boss like seven or eight times with the magnum and win.
[70:41.03]That's the whole point.
[70:46.47]Okay, let's go.
[70:49.69]Now I can get out of here.
[70:53.62]Can I kill down, what's down here?
[70:57.98]What's like further down this way?
[71:11.77]Wait, is that a giant monster guy?
[71:28.02]It is.
[71:28.36]Holy shit, it is.
[71:31.60]It's one of the huge things.
[71:37.31]They gave you that weapon for- I'm not using that weapon.
[71:57.72]Where'd he go?
[71:58.04]Is he on the roof?
[72:11.19]Where did he go?
[72:11.73]There he is.
[72:32.10]Oh my god!
[72:33.18]Wait, what am I doing?
[72:33.92]Ah!
[72:46.80]What did I do that for?
[72:47.60]I walked into him.
[73:14.06]My god stop what am I why is he up here again?
[73:17.07]What he ran that way?
[73:19.19]What kind of cartoon is this?
[73:24.52]He ran down there
[73:45.22]Nice.
[73:45.50]That's like $50,000.
[73:46.62]Use the magnum?
[73:48.34]No.
[73:49.08]I'm going to save the magnum.
[73:53.39]The magnum is only to be used.
[73:56.09]Only.
[73:56.41]It's back there.
[74:02.57]At the final boss.
[74:07.83]Oh, cool.
[74:11.15]Zipline.
[74:12.21]Cool, but hold on.
[74:13.00]What else is over here?
[74:15.45]Is there anything else cool I can do?
[74:16.51]A well.
[74:21.66]Aha.
[74:23.50]I have the webcam on.
[74:24.48]Don't be weird.
[74:35.19]Flashbangs.
[74:35.87]Cool.
[74:35.99]Alright.
[74:44.35]Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
[75:12.47]Cool.
[75:12.89]Alright.
[75:13.79]Now we leave this area completely.
[75:15.73]Go back to... I'm going to go back to the merchant.
[75:31.65]What was the point of... Going on the zipline?
[75:43.98]Was there a point of going to the zipline?
[75:49.02]You unlocked it.
[75:49.70]Now this goes just back.
[75:52.80]We have to go.
[75:53.48]I'm assuming we have to go this way.
[75:56.26]Like this way.
[75:59.82]It was for fun.
[76:00.41]Yeah, I guess it was kind of fun.
[76:03.95]Use ball.
[76:04.59]Use ball.
[76:05.21]Right.
[76:05.41]Ball.
[76:06.09]Ball.
[76:08.22]Where do I put the mermaid ball?
[76:10.36]There was like a mermaid thing.
[76:14.30]Is it in here?
[76:14.94]Where was it?
[76:17.16]Ball.
[76:17.58]Ball.
[76:18.00]Yeah.
[76:18.30]But where is it?
[76:19.06]Where is it?
[76:19.38]In here?
[76:19.64]I remember there was one in here.
[76:24.34]It was in there.
[76:27.52]Down?
[76:29.90]Where do I put the ball?
[76:32.75]On the map.
[76:33.71]Is it?
[76:37.46]Not in the windmill behind it.
[76:42.66]I remember looking at it and going, what the hell is this for?
[76:50.51]Oh, yes, I know what that is now.
[76:51.69]Yeah, it's back here.
[76:53.41]Okay, so this is the mermaid ball.
[77:01.10]And that goes down here.
[77:03.38]Like a puzzle.
[77:15.03]This is kind of cool.
[77:27.85]What do I get at the end?
[77:42.80]It's fun.
[77:44.74]It is kind of fun.
[77:55.15]Hooray!
[77:58.14]Chartreuse skull.
[78:02.00]Holy shit, that's probably worth a lot of money.
[78:09.18]Crystallized human remains found in the labyrinth by the windmills.
[78:11.96]Very valuable.
[78:13.46]Not combinable either.
[78:20.20]Very, very cool.
[78:21.04]Alright.
[78:21.62]Nice.
[78:21.88]I got stuff.
[78:33.06]Arteries?
[78:33.76]I don't know.
[78:34.10]This way.
[78:34.40]What the fuck?
[78:39.40]I kind of don't want to go this way.
[78:48.44]This way.
[78:49.14]Wait.
[78:49.66]Are they helping me?
[78:50.70]They're actually telling me where to go.
[78:51.83]This way, Papa.
[79:00.67]Is it a trap?
[79:18.60]I want to go back to the merchant.
[79:22.06]Rose is waiting for you.
[79:23.82]Yeah, but hold on.
[79:24.52]I want to go talk to the merchant.
[79:26.16]Oh.
[79:32.64]That's rare meat.
[79:34.40]This is rare meat, right?
[79:39.26]Oh.
[79:42.99]I just saw the huge...
[79:49.38]We offer these goats of warding to protect the village and its people.
[79:52.48]Any who break them shall feel Mother Miranda's wrath.
[79:56.76]Would I not be shooting those?
[79:57.68]Go must go on.
[80:05.39]Yes, it will.
[80:07.17]But I want to go back.
[80:13.81]Hold on, what's here?
[80:22.08]I need fish.
[80:24.06]I'll be able to get a permanent upgrade with this.
[80:32.39]Alright, I should be able to get some upgrades.
[80:38.89]You deserve everything coming to you.
[80:41.53]I have to kill the- I told you yesterday, I don't want to kill the animals, but I have to.
[80:46.34]Because if you don't kill the animals, you don't get the permanent upgrades.
[80:51.91]Alright, I gotta go back this way.
[80:52.93]Back to the hub.
[81:02.13]Up here, right?
[81:02.74]Yep.
[81:02.94]Don't forget about that blue bird.
[81:06.76]Yeah, that's right.
[81:07.18]There was like a blue bird in that graveyard area.
[81:12.82]Aye.
[81:12.98]Alright.
[81:21.67]Did I tell you guys that I'm... I'm talking.
[81:25.17]Did I tell you guys that I'm growing sunflowers?
[81:30.31]They were planted like two weeks ago.
[81:31.58]They look really cool.
[81:37.72]We don't care.
[81:38.28]Okay.
[81:56.11]Holy shit, 40,000.
[81:56.55]40,000.
[81:56.63]Only 20,000?
[81:56.81]That's it?
[81:57.17]I care.
[82:00.59]Yeah, I know.
[82:01.19]I do too.
[82:21.03]I got, I got four.
[82:23.09]So this is, this is, hey, you want to think of a fun gift?
[82:25.81]Here's a gift.
[82:27.47]Make sure the person that you're giving this gift to, like, actually wants a sunflower.
[82:31.72]So you grow, like, got four sunflowers growing in a big pot.
[82:36.08]Huge pot.
[82:37.02]It's big enough.
[82:37.66]You space them out.
[82:38.32]They got to be, I believe, somewhere around eight inches apart to be able to have a sunflower little, like, kind of pot garden.
[82:44.90]And make sure it's deep, too.
[82:46.04]It's got, this has got to be, like, a couple feet deep.
[82:47.92]It's got to be, like, a two to three foot deep pot.
[82:52.00]But then, as they get to be little babies, they grow up to be like this tall.
[82:56.94]They get like a couple leaves.
[82:58.93]What you could do... Hey!
[83:00.63]I got a sunflower!
[83:03.97]You want a sunflower?
[83:04.97]Here's a gift.
[83:05.51]It's a sunflower.
[83:06.05]It's about to be an adult.
[83:08.05]In like two or three more weeks, it grows into a beautiful head.
[83:10.90]It's got the seeds and everything.
[83:12.06]And it's a great gift.
[83:14.06]Because you did all the hard work.
[83:15.02]They just have to put it in the ground.
[83:16.06]Or put it in a pot.
[83:18.58]It's very hard.
[83:20.58]Gardening stream.
[83:25.60]I wanted... I wanted, like, those mammoth monster, like, 15-foot sunflowers.
[83:32.36]I just wanted to have, like, one just gigantic god sunflower just sitting.
[83:38.35]But it was just too big.
[83:43.97]The seeds are tasty.
[83:44.85]Sunflower seeds are incredible, yeah.
[83:48.83]They call them mammoth sunflowers.
[83:50.43]They're ridiculous.
[83:51.09]Their heads are bigger than ours.
[83:53.17]Like, a mammoth sunflower's head is probably, like, as big or a little bit bigger than my fucking head.
[83:59.62]They're enormous.
[84:01.56]They're really cool, though.
[84:03.56]Sunflowers are, like, my favorite plant.
[84:05.36]Those of you that didn't know.
[84:06.50]There's more things you can know about me.
[84:08.34]Hmm.
[84:24.71]Alright, this is for the shotgun.
[84:28.95]This is for the... I should just get the upgrades, right?
[84:32.71]Because I have... Yeah, get the upgrades.
[84:40.41]Upgrade the shit.
[84:41.33]And then I'm going to buy... I want this to be a two or three shot kill for the boss.
[84:57.54]This simple modification can be done in just a moment.
[85:00.29]Ammo.
[85:00.87]I love that.
[85:01.25]A shotgun is my favorite weapon.
[85:12.57]What?
[85:13.75]Ah, it's fine.
[85:14.61]All finished.

[85:24.56]Thank you for your purchase.
[85:27.64]And... Give me a bunch of these too.
[85:35.42]Alright, we're good.
[85:41.23]I also... Can I store shit?
[85:45.75]Is there a way for me to put something in the storage?
[85:47.47]So I don't have to... Because I don't really want the grenade launcher on me.
[85:49.75]Is there like a storage...
[85:58.26]Alright, this is it.
[85:59.10]So, this is meat.
[86:00.44]It's this one.
[86:01.78]Health increases permanently.
[86:03.70]Oh, I need another fish.
[86:04.56]Damn it.
[86:09.16]Damage taken when guarding greatly decreases.
[86:11.22]I don't guard.
[86:15.10]I gotta get more fish.
[86:15.95]Damn it.
[86:30.35]Carry on.
[86:32.09]Wait.
[86:32.25]Is this going to waste it?
[86:36.63]Oh, wait.
[86:36.99]He can just take it.
[86:37.92]And then he keeps it.
[86:38.80]Okay.
[86:40.02]I'm working on that one.
[86:41.76]Oh, no.
[86:42.26]Never mind.
[86:42.74]Oh, yeah.
[86:42.94]That worked.
[86:44.36]Health greatly increases permanently.
[86:46.26]I want that one.
[86:49.02]Movement speed increases.
[86:51.22]Yeah.
[86:51.38]Let's do the health.
[86:52.48]Okay.
[87:02.40]What else do I need from meat?
[87:15.33]Meat is good.
[87:15.91]Meat is good.
[87:16.49]Fish.
[87:18.69]Alright.
[87:18.99]I'll just... Whatever.
[87:22.41]Anything else use quality meat?
[87:27.75]No.
[87:28.25]This is the only thing that uses it.
[87:29.23]I'll just take it.
[87:31.74]carry on okay now all the meat's out of my inventory it's sure to be a good meal sure so now where how do I store items please come again oh should I just sell the grenade launcher oh good I was just thinking of ways to pass the time
[88:06.24]Can't store things.
[88:08.76]Maybe I will want it later.
[88:09.76]Okay.
[88:10.20]Alright, well that freed up some space.
[88:16.43]Do I have anything that I can use?
[88:17.99]Let's see.
[88:18.59]I have two.
[88:20.85]Hold on, I have three.
[88:21.67]How do I change the type of ammo I'm using?
[88:26.85]F?
[88:28.53]How do I change that to the other ones?
[88:30.03]Press F. That's weird.
[88:34.99]Why is it...
[88:38.70]Oh, you have to just be aiming.
[88:39.92]Okay, so this is explosive.
[88:42.58]Cool.
[88:50.69]I still have mines, too.
[89:02.37]Alright, it needs to be cleaner than that, right?
[89:03.97]I have to have a nice inventory.
[89:07.65]Can't live like that.
[89:10.24]12 shotgun.
[89:10.82]I've got plenty of health.
[89:12.02]Alright, I'm ready to keep going.
[89:12.90]Everything's loaded up.
[89:18.31]Let's move.
[89:21.41]It's the Duke.
[89:22.51]No!
[89:23.15]Alright.
[89:27.82]So, we're going back down.
[89:29.48]We're going to go, he says, this way, this way, this way.
[89:31.82]I'm going to see if I can get that treasure too.
[89:33.06]Let's do it.
[89:33.72]This game is fucking good.
[89:34.76]It went up to an 8.7.
[89:38.15]In case anybody was curious.
[89:40.39]It was an 8-6 yesterday.
[89:41.45]Okay, now I want to go down here.
[89:52.01]This is where I got in trouble last time.
[89:56.44]Trying to figure out how to get around.
[90:10.98]Here we go again.
[90:12.54]RTX is not on, and the only reason why it's not on is because one of my fans stopped working in the front of the case.
[90:20.27]And I'm, I don't know, I'm, it's, the 3090s run real hot.
[90:25.06]I don't want it to run at like 110 Celsius, like for six hours.
[90:31.45]This way?
[90:31.95]How do I get over here?
[90:32.99]Right?
[90:33.41]Like, remember this?
[90:34.23]Remember this nonsense?
[90:36.45]If I go straight from here, then I'll be able to go this way, and then... In here?
[90:48.77]RTX would get you more viewers.
[90:50.09]Get the chicken.
[90:58.83]Through the chicken pen.
[91:03.49]than ice no so what's going to happen is I will stream whatever game comes out they can utilize it I will play games with rtx on and everything where's this chicken I want to get a substantial cooling system for this thing because this thing seriously runs
[91:31.68]Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[91:34.11]Like super hot.
[91:35.59]Like holy shit hot.
[91:40.55]I can't get that through here.
[91:42.51]The same problem that I had last time is trying to find the one specific route to go around like three different circles to find your way around to like down here.
[91:49.60]I have to go this way.
[91:55.04]I have to get over here.
[91:57.81]So if I go through here, then I can go straight and then wrap around this way.
[92:02.05]So I need to get over here.
[92:07.70]Go through this shortcut window.
[92:09.16]Super, super overthinking Andy.
[92:16.19]What do you mean?
[92:28.20]Oh, there it is.
[92:28.64]Okay.
[92:34.20]Overthinking Andy.
[92:36.77]Locked due to missing homeowner.
[92:38.01]Alright.
[92:40.49]Let's get the whatever this is in here.
[92:48.48]Yeah, I also think I might want a solution for my CPU, too, because I have a Ryzen 5700 or something.
[92:55.50]It's one of those 8-core, like, 10-core or something.
[92:58.12]And I don't want, like, a stock fan on it.
[93:00.37]I want, like, something... Right now, there's, like, one of those H100, whatever they are, coolers.
[93:07.83]I don't know.
[93:08.63]Maybe I'll... Oh, shit.
[93:14.83]I don't have... No, I don't have a stock fan on it.
[93:17.21]I say I don't... That's my point.
[93:19.87]The 3090 just has a stock fan system.
[93:23.83]And that's like... I don't... For a 3090... I don't know.
[93:27.29]It's like there's a car in my room.
[93:30.44]I don't... I kind of want something better than that.
[93:31.92]Doll.
[93:37.80]Complete antique doll of a young witch based on a local legend.
[93:43.42]Can I put this...
[93:47.01]Can I put this down at the doll boss's grave?
[93:53.43]Will I get the treasure?
[93:57.34]No.
[93:57.80]Damn it.
[93:58.20]Okay, whatever.
[93:59.90]Well, there's that.
[94:00.74]Got it.
[94:02.44]Now we have to go get the actual treasure, which is over here.
[94:09.12]The treasure only.
[94:09.96]It would be a key item.
[94:11.14]Okay.
[94:11.32]Okay.
[94:12.88]To whom may concern, due to the Luthier's long absence, I am keeping hold of his house key.
[94:17.34]Please find me if you need it.
[94:20.07]Well, I found it.
[94:25.17]What do you got in here?
[94:30.61]Is it a enemy machine gun?
[94:34.32]see they played metal slug anytime when you pick up a machine gun they say heavy machine gun but when I was younger I thought they said enemy machine gun that's an enemy machine gun there's a little bit lower of my 14 year old brain alright what do you got in here enemy and it was like enemy machine gun
[95:07.51]I don't know why I thought those spelled out like the numbers.
[95:10.97]Oh, shit.
[95:11.39]I need a code?
[95:17.07]Thanks for that.
[95:20.52]This code's probably written somewhere on like a... One of these loots.
[95:27.88]I'll never forget her fifth birthday.
[95:29.88]7639... 763934.
[96:01.34]What the fuck was that?
[96:05.44]It's her birthday.
[96:06.35]Whose birthday?
[96:11.33]I'll never forget her fifth birthday.
[96:19.71]Yeah, that's what- that's October 8th.
[96:22.51]So that is...
[96:26.06]October 8th, 1625.
[96:26.60]That's October 8th.
[96:27.37]So that would be... 10.
[96:27.83]So 1008.
[96:28.01]1008.
[96:28.05]What year?
[96:29.09]Turn around.
[96:58.85]Did he actually see the happy birthday banner?
[97:04.88]Oh shit, what is this?
[97:06.20]Fucking leg day?
[97:07.56]Why is this circled?
[97:08.58]1625?
[97:08.60]270917 270917
[97:30.75]270917.
[97:30.79]Steel.
[97:43.95]Whatever.
[97:44.23]I don't know what that is.
[97:45.74]Ooh!
[97:48.38]F2 rifle?
[97:51.26]F2 rifle.
[97:55.12]Do I even have an F2 rifle?
[98:05.77]High capacity mag.
[98:07.43]Let's go!
[98:08.11]Don't say that.
[98:12.88]Nice, okay.
[98:13.38]So that gave me... That thing's probably worth a shitload of money.
[98:17.22]Got the treasure chest in here.
[98:22.38]Take those chemical fluids.
[98:30.29]Oh, my arm.
[98:31.27]Okay, let's go.
[98:35.22]Yeah, I don't want to just, like, do the story.
[98:37.12]I want to, like, get all the cool stuff.
[98:38.98]At least some of it.
[98:46.04]That completes that.
[98:47.41]And then... I'm just going to go across.
[98:50.07]And there's something to explore.
[98:56.97]This house.
[98:57.87]No.
[99:01.35]Get in this house.
[99:06.47]I can't even get in that house.
[99:07.41]Alright, now let's head back to the guy, sell that shit, upgrade one more time, and then get out of here.
[99:17.56]Some secret treasure chest.
[99:18.86]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[99:20.70]Alright, let's go.
[99:21.62]Get me out.
[99:26.08]Uh, let's get a head out.
[99:27.58]Up.
[99:27.82]I'm gonna go up.
[99:28.50]Whatever.
[99:36.92]Wait, hold on.
[99:37.42]Can I?
[99:37.66]Can I get there?
[99:41.91]No, I can't.
[99:45.17]Just head back out.
[99:49.91]He's mispronouncing it on purpose.
[99:54.61]Mispronouncing treasure chest on purpose.
[99:57.28]Yes.
[99:59.82]I think it's fun to say it the other way.
[100:07.03]I think saying treasure chest is a fun word to say.
[100:11.77]Alright, where's this... I got the permanent health upgrade.
[100:20.88]Hell yeah.
[100:36.53]What happened to the normal stream?
[100:37.75]I already lost after the fish came out of the water and scared me.
[100:40.83]Alright, juicy game.
[100:46.54]Health greatly increases permanently.
[100:52.98]Let's go.
[100:53.46]This reminds me of Monster Hunter.
[101:08.57]Cat puke.
[101:09.17]Somebody nominate it.
[101:10.15]Yes, I'm drinking a coconut water.
[101:16.13]Relax.
[101:16.25]It's not a big deal.
[101:40.81]It's hydrating.
[101:41.45]Look, people are going to be like, oh, I want a Reddit drink.
[101:44.16]Whatever.
[101:49.72]What else can I do?
[101:54.60]Poultry.
[101:55.12]I need one more fish.
[101:58.73]I need a lot more fish, actually.
[102:04.27]Whatever.
[102:04.59]I don't need poultry anymore, so just dump it.
[102:11.46]We're going to water Doobie fresh though.
[102:13.54]People.
[102:13.84]Very valuable.
[102:14.44]Nice.
[102:14.72]Very valuable.
[102:15.22]Nice.
[102:15.42]Okay.
[102:15.58]Doobie fresh.
[102:16.64]What?
[102:16.78]This is all an investment, Ethan.
[102:42.26]A good deal, if I say so myself.
[102:44.74]Did somebody say, do I drink LaCroix?
[102:54.87]No.
[102:57.25]Didn't I already tell you that, like, LaCroix... Did I make this reference?
[103:00.81]LaCroix tastes like air in an airplane, right?
[103:03.61]Like, it's like airplane air.
[103:04.85]Or was that a different drink?
[103:07.95]I don't remember what drink that was.
[103:14.91]Alright, so we're going to go back and... Oh, you know what?
[103:20.99]You know, I'm doing it.
[103:21.79]I'm here.
[103:22.33]No, there's no more left in there.
[103:23.29]Alright, I'm just going to go follow the signs.
[103:24.33]Whatever, let's go.
[103:30.33]Rose is waiting for you.
[103:40.19]This way.
[103:40.89]The show must go on.
[103:47.19]Skip all the optional content.
[103:50.47]I mean, I just did optional content for like the last 30 minutes.
[104:01.56]Good luck.
[104:07.52]Good luck?
[104:08.70]I was wrong.
[104:10.99]I had to do reverb, not echo.
[104:14.77]Wait, what?
[104:26.06]Whoa.
[104:36.70]I just woke him up.
[104:40.29]Holy shit.
[104:49.26]There's a treasure in here.
[104:50.04]Shit.
[104:58.65]Can I get across?
[105:01.28]There's no boat!
[105:05.35]I guess I don't need a boat.
[105:06.15]Is this where I'm supposed to go?
[105:20.47]There's like two tre- there's two- I can't even say the word right.
[105:23.43]I've been saying it wrong for so many years.
[105:25.07]That- that sounds backwards to my brain.
[105:29.25]I have to say, Chesser's Rest.
[105:33.17]Why would I use a shotgun for this?
[105:43.86]What does that sound?
[105:44.96]That's weird.
[105:51.87]Well.
[105:57.30]You're giving me them for a reason.
[106:00.82]I might as well put it on the bar.
[106:20.96]Fresh.
[106:22.85]Oh, this shit is fresh.
[106:23.85]This is fresh.
[106:25.69]Otto?
[106:55.87]Come on.
[107:00.19]Why are you still runs?
[107:12.38]Oh!
[107:25.62]What's he doing?
[107:30.09]Oh god, he summoned the flying objects.
[107:37.65]What?!
[107:38.31]Get away from me, bats!
[107:53.24]Get away from me, bats!
[107:56.60]Don't trigger that.
[108:08.25]Oh my god, he's fast.
[108:13.53]Oh my god, he's fast!
[108:37.79]Do I have any mines?
[108:38.41]Do I have any more mines?
[108:49.87]I didn't mean to fall!
[109:04.67]Feed Otto.
[109:12.51]Oh my god, this guy has invi- Why does this guy take so many shots?
[109:16.99]He's invincible!
[109:29.82]Holy shit, he's invincible.
[109:40.11]Is this guy supposed to be this ridiculous?
[109:59.69]Why is he have so much health?
[110:00.85]Oh
[110:10.89]I have to start sniping them.
[110:12.09]Pipe bombs.
[110:21.58]Fuck!
[110:31.44]I finally killed the motherfucker.
[110:32.85]Oh my god, are you kidding me?
[110:34.13]That took every- all my- oh, I-
[110:41.81]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[110:42.71]Settle down.
[110:43.37]I did it.
[110:43.69]Just relax.
[110:53.14]Get the fuck out of here.
[110:55.14]Stop it.
[111:01.26]Jeez.
[111:02.64]Okay, that... Okay.
[111:07.49]That was ridiculous.
[111:08.43]That was ridiculous.
[111:09.99]Giant crystal axe.
[111:13.74]I mean, if that's not 50k, then I don't know what is.
[111:15.64]Good job using all your ammo.
[111:20.80]Yeah, but I mean, come on.
[111:21.68]It's probably worth it.
[111:24.00]I can always craft my stuff.
[111:26.48]Look, if I'm not going to use... Don't fret.
[111:30.81]Remember, I have the magnum.
[111:34.03]The whole point of the magnum is to never use it one time until the last few bosses that are very difficult, and then I can kill them.
[111:41.87]Very quickly.
[111:43.23]Okay, there's still a chest in here.
[111:56.34]Oh, whoa.
[112:06.44]Anything else that I'd missed in here?
[112:07.54]No.
[112:12.39]Alright.
[112:13.31]Barbecue.
[112:15.85]I don't want to eat this.
[112:20.13]Fish.
[112:20.41]Alright.
[112:20.63]There we go.
[112:21.41]I can complete that if I want to.
[112:23.65]Speaking of doing things.
[112:25.05]Alright.
[112:25.65]Yeah.
[112:46.58]Let me reload this.
[112:47.80]If I panic use it in the next few chapters, I'll be able to use it.
[112:53.00]Okay, what got taken?
[112:58.29]Oh, right, this.
[113:05.55]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[113:06.19]Let's go.
[113:19.69]Father Nicola's angel.
[113:28.23]That's the chest.
[113:33.29]Father Cola?
[113:37.51]Father Cola.
[113:39.73]Father Coca-Cola.
[113:46.21]Oh So that was optional
[114:16.25]See?
[114:16.55]He does optional Andy.
[114:18.61]He doesn't do the optional stuff.
[114:20.01]Yes, he does.
[114:20.57]What was that for?
[114:38.60]Oven.
[114:43.69]Just checking to see if there's any fish or anything.
[114:47.33]Is your name actually Andy?
[114:48.45]Yes, it's Andy Anderson.
[114:59.20]Well, now I have to go back and sell this stuff.
[115:07.69]You look like an Andy.
[115:24.01]You gotta f- I thought the, uh, filter was still on.
[115:27.83]So.
[115:27.89]Hooray!
[115:30.74]Health increases permanently.
[115:35.52]Make it.
[115:59.79]Health increased permanently.
[116:00.75]And then we have... Juicy game.
[116:06.19]Yum, yum, yum.
[116:06.87]Okay, what else is here?
[116:12.40]All that's left to do is... I mean... There's no more poultry, right?
[116:16.22]Okay, it's just... I need one more... Poultry.
[116:23.46]Okay.
[116:26.00]I don't really care about this one.
[116:27.43]I never do it.
[116:28.65]So I just need fish and finest fish.
[116:32.45]All the other stuff that I have... So can I... Should I just delete the meat?
[116:35.13]What do I even need it for?
[116:36.97]You have an eye for quality.
[116:39.54]Should I just, like, throw this away?
[116:41.16]Just discard it, right?
[116:45.62]There's no point in doing this.
[116:46.94]Oh, I can sell it.
[116:47.54]Okay.
[116:48.51]Well, then, feel free to peruse.
[116:51.13]I can sell it, you're right.
[116:54.28]Giant Crystal Axe?
[116:55.80]I wish it was more than that.
[116:57.06]I feel like that fight took $50,000 of supplies, and I got $30,000 in return.
[116:59.84]Thanks.
[116:59.98]I still don't know what to do with this.
[117:27.99]Alright, I got 100,000 bucks.
[117:28.99]What should I do?
[117:38.10]Yeah, put that on.
[117:38.88]Okay.
[117:49.53]What a waste.
[117:57.73]Why is it a waste?
[117:58.55]Good.
[117:58.71]I like this gun.
[118:07.65]Reload the magnum.
[118:30.22]I don't know.
[118:30.50]It's got five in it.
[118:33.34]Get the pipe bomb blueprint.
[118:37.38]Get all the blueprints.
[118:38.30]What's the point of not having them?
[118:40.57]They're cheap.
[118:47.13]Yeah.
[118:48.13]Why would I not get them?
[118:50.65]Or healing.
[118:53.21]Alright.
[118:53.61]Let's see.
[118:53.99]I can make pipe bomb.
[118:59.86]Let me go with five health kits.
[119:01.60]I feel like I'm terrible at this game and terrible at video games in general.
[119:08.59]More shotgun ammo.
[119:10.37]And I'll make another pipe bomb.
[119:13.79]Alright, there you go.
[119:14.41]I got my shit.
[119:15.39]Let's rearrange it.
[119:40.66]better looking good okay perfect looks good inventory looks so nice thank you I tried
[119:59.35]Moving on.
[120:01.85]Now it's time to go through the main storyline.
[120:13.00]Rose is waiting for you.
[120:14.57]The show must go on.
[120:26.17]Take a break?
[120:26.95]Um, not yet.
[120:28.77]I think we'll get a break in soon, though.
[120:49.67]Is he up on there?
[120:50.35]Where is he?
[120:50.77]That sounded like he was right next to me.
[120:58.59]Oh, that's where all the... Wait, those are not bad.
[121:00.27]I thought those were the big, um, like, flying bat people things.
[121:13.32]Ooh, a nerb.
[121:32.04]Gimme the money.
[121:43.53]Crap, scrap, scrap.
[121:44.33]Alright, anybody else?
[121:47.35]Hey!
[121:57.46]Stay back!
[122:05.18]Okay.
[122:07.10]Go!
[122:14.37]Don't even... You're annoying!
[122:35.26]I changed my zoom button.
[122:36.26]What I... Okay, control.
[122:40.38]I shot the arrow and his head.
[122:41.59]That should be a clip.
[123:01.94]God.
[123:03.95]Why are you giving me this stuff?
[123:06.97]Why are you giving me this?
[123:08.09]You give me this for a reason.
[123:12.46]Anytime you see like a highly explosive device in one of these games, something horrible happens.
[123:50.51]Oh, you're climbing.
[123:51.71]I almost had a handgun bullet.
[124:08.78]I need handgun ammo.
[124:09.58]I should probably craft some.
[124:13.45]I told you, I'm a big handgun guy.
[124:16.27]I love using handguns in games.
[124:17.41]It's what I use the most.
[124:19.09]How do I get this door open?
[124:24.20]The reason why I'm not good at Counter-Strike, or any of those games that require you to be, like, good at a video game, is because I can't do, like, the crouch, and hit people in the head.
[124:32.82]No.
[124:34.31]Like, you give me the deagle, and I'll go, I can win.
[124:37.97]But, like, I always get outplayed by the person that can, like, crouch, shoot, crouch, crouch, crouch, shoot.
[124:41.73]Alright, let's get this door open.
[124:48.82]How do we do it?
[124:51.14]What is back here?
[124:58.05]There's a treasure over here somewhere.
[125:00.41]Like, right here.
[125:01.09]Doesn't hurt you, right?
[125:15.15]Standing on top of it?
[125:23.86]Is that it right there?
[125:24.94]No.
[125:25.30]Wait, what?
[125:28.28]I think it's up.
[125:30.32]Read the name of the treasure.
[125:32.06]Treasure under the stronghold.
[125:33.76]It's not above me then.
[125:39.65]Alright, a way up.
[125:51.32]A way up.
[125:56.04]Away is shot.
[125:58.04]It was made for those who are dead.
[125:59.92]This is Peter Jackson's least favorite part of the movie.
[126:05.15]He wanted to delete this part.
[126:08.25]He was so desperate to remove this part from the movie because he's despised and he thought it was too long.
[126:13.73]It's true.
[126:17.10]Okay, there it is.
[126:20.52]Worth a shot.
[126:40.60]Why am I streaming at 864p?
[126:54.08]I don't know.
[126:55.28]If I pressed a couple of random... I fucked it up.
[126:57.84]It's supposed to be 720.
[126:58.46]I don't know what I did.
[127:10.05]Am I missing something here?
[127:21.46]Yeah, the stairs.
[127:23.02]Cute.
[127:38.16]not a 1080 because my computer will blow up I don't I mean right now let's see I have to you know this is a I want a my hw monitor has been running for a while I want to ask you guys this right now my gpu is at 70 degrees the gpu memory is at 86 degrees celsius is that okay for 3090.
[128:05.55]The peak temperature of the GPU was 75 degrees.
[128:08.34]Peak temperature of the memory on the GPU was 90 degrees Celsius.
[128:12.44]That seems kind of high.
[128:13.20]My CPU is 77 right now.
[128:22.03]The maximum that it was during this stream was 84 degrees Celsius.
[128:25.49]That's kind of high for a CPU, isn't it?
[128:29.59]VRAM always runs hot on new cards, you know.
[128:32.88]Up to 90 is fine, I guess, yeah.
[128:35.58]3090 is, like, boiling, yeah.
[128:39.48]100 Celsius is boiling.
[128:40.82]That's almost 200 degrees, Jeremiah.
[128:42.24]Yeah, I know, that's ridiculous.
[128:43.48]84 is hot.
[128:46.87]Yeah.
[128:48.03]I gotta just get, like, a better... Like, cooling unit in here.
[128:52.75]Okay.
[128:59.76]You missed the stairs, so let me not miss the stairs...
[129:04.47]Stairs that way.
[129:05.41]Wait.
[129:07.30]Oh my god, there's a fucking camouflaged ladder.
[129:12.85]Really, Capecom?
[129:37.45]Here comes the horde.
[129:42.60]Oh, you don't think so.
[129:51.70]I thought the lamppost was a bad guy.
[129:53.24]I'm fine.
[130:18.34]Is this timed or something?
[130:19.28]Alright, I gotta go.
[130:26.18]What did I just do?
[130:27.31]Whee!
[130:27.95]Don't blow it up right now.
[130:39.83]Oh, fuck.
[130:54.64]I just made the Angry Birds sound?
[130:57.98]What's the Angry Birds sound?
[131:09.89]Angry Birds?
[131:10.53]What Angry Birds?
[131:17.63]The Wii.
[131:20.37]Oh.
[131:32.35]Alright, I gotta... Let's go.
[131:44.70]Have you played Angry Birds?
[131:46.38]Not really.
[131:46.88]I played Crush the Castle, the actual game that came before it.
[132:02.45]Fake gamer?
[132:03.05]Are you sure about the real gamer?
[132:04.03]Because I played Crush the Castle.
[132:05.56]I missed.
[132:20.41]What else can I make?
[132:21.01]I got plenty of health.
[132:23.57]More shotguns.
[132:24.35]Yes.
[132:25.31]Thank you very much.
[132:26.11]Let's go.
[132:28.85]Only real gamers played Crush the Castle.
[132:34.86]That's what I just said.
[132:36.30]I want you to time that person up for three days.
[132:39.66]Don't actually do that.
[132:40.32]I'm kidding.
[132:48.20]Oh, I can't make it.
[132:50.17]Don't.
[132:50.41]I'm kidding.
[132:50.79]Don't do that.
[132:51.15]Alright, here we go.
[132:56.79]We are in the stronghold now.
[132:59.55]I feel like I'm invading Mordor right now.
[133:06.38]Or I'm playing Might and Magic.
[133:29.28]I'm trying to line them up and kill too many people at the same time.
[133:36.00]Are you serious?
[133:36.64]How did you get me?
[133:46.35]Who the fuck?
[133:53.67]What the?
[133:54.13]Why is there so many people?
[134:29.47]Wait, time out, come on.
[134:30.83]No, I said.
[135:06.17]Do they just, do they not stop?
[135:10.21]This is quite the horde I'm fighting.
[135:11.67]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[135:17.40]Do they never stop?
[135:19.32]Maybe they don't stop.
[135:25.71]Alright, just go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[135:30.55]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[135:34.83]I gotta start throwing bombs.
[135:36.71]I have like 10 pipe bombs.
[135:48.21]I got locked into it!
[135:50.23]Give me all the stuff!
[136:05.46]Is he dead?
[136:05.92]Hey!
[136:10.04]Oh god, did I drop it?
[136:13.14]I'm just like farming for items.
[136:15.72]Oh my god!
[136:16.50]Fuck!
[136:24.75]Did I get in?
[136:39.60]I just want items and shit.
[136:41.38]Alright.
[136:41.62]Stop!
[136:41.84]Stop!
[136:42.52]I have enough.
[136:42.90]I have enough.
[136:43.24]I already have enough.
[136:43.72]I have enough.
[136:53.33]Just run?
[136:54.21]Where am I supposed to go?
[137:07.01]Come on!
[137:07.33]Come on!
[137:07.63]Come on!
[137:07.93]Whoa!
[137:08.37]Whoa!
[137:08.51]Whoa!
[137:08.67]Whoa!
[137:12.08]He's going to drop an item and I want it!
[137:15.14]Big guy?
[137:27.79]Oh!
[137:55.90]He's still alive!
[138:08.44]What the fuck?
[138:14.69]There's so much stuff on the ground, just get it all.
[138:16.05]Come on, come on, come on, are you happy?
[138:20.09]Are you happy?
[138:21.59]Are you happy you had the onions?
[138:23.29]Are you glad you're happy you had the onions?
[138:25.73]Crispy onions!
[138:26.82]They have to be crispy!
[138:33.08]Is everything dead?
[138:33.60]Okay.
[138:48.97]I'm gonna walk around and collect everything.
[138:50.79]Holy shit, that was so long!
[138:53.93]There's so much shit all over the ground, and I'm going to craft all my weapons again.
[139:13.16]Minecraft Andy.
[139:14.24]I mean, come on.
[139:15.02]I just used so much shit.
[139:18.22]I need to at least see if anything's still here.
[139:24.16]Didn't all disappear, right?
[139:31.66]There's no fall damage in the whole game, don't worry.
[139:34.73]Maybe I got everything.
[139:39.61]The fucking AI director got angry!
[139:42.37]Oh no, did I just redo it?
[139:46.13]I didn't just like reactivate the whole encounter by going downstairs, did I?
[139:53.65]No, I gotta get out of here!
[139:57.01]What am I doing?
[139:57.91]No, I gotta get out!
[140:00.03]How do I leave?
[140:00.73]It's- Where is it?
[140:01.64]Oh my god, what did I do?
[140:07.06]What did I activate?
[140:09.02]Oh shit, this is the ghost from Bubble Bobble!
[140:20.46]I took too much time.
[140:22.49]Why did I do that?
[140:23.23]I have 15 rounds left.
[140:24.17]What are you, stupid?
[140:24.89]Okay.
[140:27.27]Give me a second.
[140:32.31]I need to make ammo for the gun.
[140:43.48]Alright.
[140:44.50]There we go.
[140:47.06]It was just one guy.
[140:48.74]Don't you know how powerful one guy can be in this world, especially this one?
[140:55.31]One guy could be potentially the most powerful entity.
[140:58.53]It can change the course of all history.
[141:01.13]You know that, if you've been in this community for long enough.
[141:03.13]What do you mean, one guy?
[141:04.87]Who is the typewriter?
[141:08.71]Jesus.
[141:22.39]Not more of that shit, is there?
[141:23.51]Is this the... What is in the water?
[141:35.23]There was something in the water.
[141:49.47]I'm gonna break through the wall?
[141:50.57]This is way too close for there not to be something smashed through this.
[141:54.03]This is like Bloodborne.
[142:17.38]My eyes are so watery.
[142:18.54]I don't think I've blinked.
[142:31.49]The king's orders... Stop Israel Free Palestine just gave 10 community subs.
[142:39.32]Thanks for the community subs.
[142:44.80]Thank you for those subs.
[142:48.80]Oh, well.
[142:51.12]The King's orders finally arrived.
[142:55.52]Withdraw.
[142:57.38]It is most vexing that we must abandon the border stronghold to those heretics.
[143:02.22]If I had but a little more time, I know I might be able to turn the tides of this battle.
[143:07.26]Nay, I should not put on airs.
[143:08.76]It is my curiosity that ties me to this place.
[143:11.13]Nice accent.
[143:17.01]How about putting on an accent?
[143:21.23]Or you just got political.
[143:22.19]I... You know what?
[143:29.83]Gotta play Resident Evil.
[143:35.18]So what?
[143:40.90]Rule number two.
[143:42.32]That's... It's just a lot of crazy shit going on in the world right now.
[143:47.92]A lot of crazy shit going on in the world right now.
[143:54.31]I don't know about you guys, but I use this, this place here, as I can escape from myself.
[144:05.36]The world is fucking crazy right now.
[144:10.51]This is my place to have fun.
[144:13.21]And kind of forget about it.
[144:15.53]If I'm completely honest.
[144:19.13]It's a way to just kind of enjoy what's going on here right now.
[144:27.40]And we don't really talk about very many things on this stream.
[144:30.92]And that's because I don't want to.
[144:34.09]Because what I want to do here is take myself away from that kind of stuff.
[144:40.87]I want to take myself away from it and enjoy this.
[144:43.63]This.
[144:47.92]We make little jokes.
[144:50.20]You've heard me do, like, fucking Trump impressions, and we talked about, like, Joe Biden is gonna watch Bionicle with you.
[144:56.70]But, like, I think that's just, like, little dumb shit that we do sometimes.
[145:01.56]But this place is for me just to come fuck around and forget about the wild fucking crazy world we actually live in.
[145:07.08]So... If you want opinions of mine on things, you're probably not gonna get them here.
[145:20.12]81 FOV was way more contentious than to you.
[145:25.48]Because that's this place here right now.
[145:28.06]81 FOV.
[145:36.67]I use streaming and just fucking around with you guys as a way to just kind of forget about shit and escape from the goddamn crazy world we're in.
[145:46.10]And I kind of want to keep it that way.
[145:48.58]So, there you go.
[145:52.32]70 FOV is too much.
[145:56.12]With that, we're going to continue.
[146:01.85]And play Resident Evil.
[146:04.65]You don't got to explain yourself.
[146:06.41]No, but I mean... I mean, sometimes I do.
[146:12.01]Because the world is so crazy that...
[146:16.45]You know, it's stuff, it's shit.
[146:18.76]Look at the last year.
[146:21.10]It's hard to ignore the last year of crazy shit.
[146:25.72]We had, like, a COVID-19 coronavirus that, like, shut the whole world down.
[146:31.08]It's hard to, like, escape from that.
[146:33.58]But, you know, I try.
[146:37.61]You still owe us a Left 4 Dead stream.
[146:43.78]You lost one K of viewers while saying, saying what?
[146:48.68]Oh, what did I say?
[146:49.44]You can be emotionally taxing.
[146:55.55]It can.
[147:00.39]And I don't, don't get me wrong.
[147:03.15]Do not twist the statements I'm going to, that I've been making here.
[147:06.87]I put a lot of private thought and a lot of personal thought into tons of stuff going on in the world.
[147:13.09]This is, this is like my place to come escape and have fun.
[147:17.95]That's all I'm gonna say.
[147:25.41]Let's continue.
[147:28.83]Anyways, here we go.
[147:34.15]Save the game.
[147:34.83]Did I get the fourth one?
[147:36.57]No.
[147:37.97]You should try taking LSD.
[147:39.60]Why would I take LSD?
[147:43.14]I don't want to take drugs.
[147:47.76]The way that I see the world and the way that my brain works up here, I think I would literally, I would probably start to fly.
[147:55.62]Maybe I would.
[147:56.31]I don't know.
[147:57.25]I'd go crazy.
[147:59.59]I would freak out if I took hard drugs.
[148:02.41]You want a TL;DR lore statement here?
[148:04.09]I've never taken hard drugs in my life.
[148:05.87]Ever.
[148:06.07]Not one time.
[148:07.11]Ever.
[148:07.25]Ever.
[148:08.82]I've drank alcohol and I've smoked weed and consumed marijuana products, right?
[148:12.88]Okay, right.
[148:14.08]Like, your grandmother does that shit, too.
[148:16.29]I've never had hard drugs before in my whole life.
[148:18.53]And they terrify me because I don't know what would happen if I took them.
[148:22.35]Like, if I ever, like, experimented with, like, a hard drug, I swear to God, I would, like, I would, like, end up somewhere.
[148:29.57]Like, I would end up, like, on another planet or something.
[148:32.31]And it would freak me out.
[148:35.24]No way.
[148:36.44]I can't do it.
[148:39.87]Alright.
[148:41.23]Engage!
[148:44.59]That's not good.
[148:52.46]Oh, it's this guy from the very beginning of the game!
[149:06.27]Alright, let's get some- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[149:07.59]Ready?
[149:07.75]Do you have any mines?
[149:13.33]Alright, pipe bomb.
[149:14.48]Let's go.
[149:15.30]Holy shit, he missed.
[149:20.86]I have no more crutches!
[149:37.23]I have no more crutch weapons!
[149:41.41]Why did I reload after taking one shot?
[149:43.11]Oh boy!
[149:48.85]Oh shit!
[150:00.05]Stop it!
[150:00.47]Don't pick shit up yet!
[150:01.69]Run!
[150:06.16]He's blind?
[150:07.06]Why?
[150:07.30]What?
[150:09.84]He hit the wall!
[150:35.31]Take his picture No, don't quit the game, why would you put photo mode right above quit game?
[150:48.01]This is like a photo of Sasquatch
[151:18.41]That focus area does not change, I swear to God.
[151:32.58]I want the focus area to be up here.
[151:34.34]Wouldn't you think that this would be like far away?
[151:50.65]And this is, like, coming... Like, how come I can't... I'm trying to... The other way.
[151:55.69]Make it... Turn it down.
[151:56.76]I'm trying to make the background blurry in his face.
[152:00.58]It's not even, like, a real camera.
[152:20.52]Oh, Bloom is turned off, like, in the settings.
[152:22.12]Never mind.
[152:39.39]Turn him off?
[152:49.34]I want a different frame.
[152:56.06]This fucking Sasquatch.
[153:17.97]Holy shit, he ran fast.
[153:32.43]Well, out of bullets.
[153:55.32]What does he do with that?
[153:56.30]What do you do with that?
[153:56.94]What is he doing with that?
[154:01.82]Got him.
[154:07.56]Or shoot him in the head.
[154:08.44]I did like a thousand times.
[154:10.92]Crystal hammer demon.
[154:19.16]This is a Dark Souls game.
[154:20.60]That's what his name would be.
[154:25.15]Put everything in here.
[154:25.79]Wait, let me make sure.
[154:34.83]Uh, there's a problem.
[154:36.59]I don't have any more shotgun shells, so we're gonna have to just use the... Sniper rifle's gonna have to turn into a makeshift shotgun.
[154:47.68]Ooh, this is pretty.
[154:50.48]Ray tracing would look really cool here.
[154:51.90]Too bad I don't have it enabled.
[154:53.08]I'm sorry.
[154:56.46]Wait.
[154:59.37]Holy shit, it's a ton of crystals.
[155:01.91]Like, actual crystals everywhere.
[155:08.61]Is there any more of those?
[155:12.48]This is free, the free money room.
[155:26.86]Wow.
[155:27.10]I think that's it, right?
[155:46.77]I don't want to miss any.
[155:47.49]It's free money.
[155:52.44]RTX on?
[155:55.40]Alright, what the hell?
[155:56.02]Let's try it.
[156:37.16]Didn't really do anything.
[156:46.87]Not really.
[156:47.23]Alright, ray tracing off.
[156:50.69]That's unfortunate.
[156:58.57]Oh, but let me turn off the... I hate volumetric lighting.
[157:00.83]I think it looks awful.
[157:03.83]Volumetric lighting to me is, it feels like I just got out of a pool.
[157:07.93]Like a chlorinated pool.
[157:12.17]You know what I mean?
[157:12.75]It's just like everything has like god rays on it.
[157:14.77]I like, I hate it.
[157:22.85]I still don't know what you're talking about when you say that.
[157:29.29]It's just exactly how it sounds.
[157:32.50]Florinated pool.
[157:34.62]Oh, I got it.
[157:35.00]The torso.
[157:45.43]It's Mia.
[157:48.13]You're the real deal, Ethan.
[157:50.27]Well done.
[157:51.91]Quit hiding, asshole.
[157:53.47]I'm not letting you get out of this.
[157:56.38]Cool your jets.
[157:58.32]Just a little bit more and you're all wrapped up.
[158:01.57]I'll lend you a hand.
[158:03.59]So in exchange... In exchange what?
[158:06.56]With an exchange.
[158:07.64]First of all, come to me.
[158:09.92]Put all the flasks in the altar, and I'm sure you'll figure the rest out.
[158:14.86]See you, Ethan.
[158:18.93]God damn it.
[158:32.28]Can somebody please edit me?
[158:34.18]Like, and just, I don't know, just... Send a clip.
[158:37.45]No, don't do that.
[158:38.19]That fucking million of you are gonna do what I ask in a second.
[158:43.31]So, no.
[158:44.51]None of you do what I'm about to say.
[158:45.83]What do you mean too late?
[158:53.74]I didn't even tell you what I wanted.
[158:54.90]I said, can you edit me?
[158:56.62]And then I stopped.
[158:57.58]You have no idea what I'm talking about.
[158:58.60]You have no idea what I want to be edited into.
[159:05.10]Is there no typewriter?
[159:06.22]Ooh, there's a treasure.
[159:08.62]Ooh.
[159:16.04]Google... Google-Emo's... Google-Emo's plate.
[159:22.16]Google-Emo's plate.
[159:24.16]Cool.
[159:24.30]Is that the treasure?
[159:39.20]I'm going to come out of the water and be very scary.
[159:42.94]I'm just going to jump out of the water and it's going to be scary.
[159:46.30]I know it's going to be scary.
[160:03.89]Yeah, please.
[160:05.45]Those of you that wonder how I make do that sound, just watch my cheeks.
[160:09.26]Bubbies.
[160:11.06]I would like some.
[160:11.70]Bubbies, bubbies, bubbies, bubbies, bubbies.
[160:14.24]It's just filling my cheeks with air and then expelling it quickly.
[160:18.36]Bubbies, bubbies.
[160:29.69]I believe this is a shortcut of some sort.
[160:33.58]So, it's cool that there is a shortcut system in this game.
[160:37.38]But what the hell?
[160:38.28]For what?
[160:41.70]Like... What is this for?
[160:44.85]Like, for what?
[160:48.17]This doesn't really do anything.
[160:49.57]Just... Because?
[160:53.79]I mean, I guess I could go sell and craft again before continuing.
[161:05.32]But do I really care to do that?
[161:07.66]I guess.
[161:15.49]They're going to give it to me, might as well.
[161:22.11]From here, I need to go straight down.
[161:25.66]I can't.
[161:28.68]I missed a shiny.
[161:31.20]Where?
[161:35.25]You have about three hours left.
[161:37.81]It's exactly what I thought too.
[161:39.79]Where's the shiny?
[161:48.84]It's precisely what I thought too.
[161:50.26]Alright, what's the fastest way for me to get... I probably need to go this way.
[162:00.03]Yeah, just go around that way.
[162:04.07]I'll sell...
[162:08.03]the hell was that?
[162:17.86]What was the big T-Rex growl for?
[162:23.54]You know, I probably could do a T-Rex growl.
[162:25.75]Let me try.
[162:26.09]Let me see.
[162:31.91]Let me see if I can do a T-Rex growl.
[162:33.09]Let me see.
[162:35.96]me see if I can get it to work okay so this is kind of up that's not what it's supposed to sound like hello hello hello hello hello hello hello I can't do it why is it doing that though that doesn't sound right that sounds
[163:03.40]Yesterday, I did this and I did the same knob.
[163:06.87]I did this same knob yesterday.
[163:11.03]And now it's a different sound coming out of it.
[163:12.73]I don't know why.
[163:16.34]Don't ask me why.
[163:18.32]But the idea was I was going to go... That's close.
[163:24.62]That's kind of close.
[163:33.01]That's Chewie?
[163:34.09]That was not Chewie.
[163:34.85]That was the T-Rex from Jurassic Park 1.
[163:42.06]Stop, you're hurting him.
[163:47.56]That was not Chewie.
[163:48.44]Chewie is like a... That's Chewie.

[164:58.33]I'm skilled at all sorts of weapons modifications and will do them for a small fee.
[165:03.48]I feel like I should buy some ammo.
[165:04.86]I know that probably sounds crazy to a lot of you, but seriously.
[165:07.52]Look at how low I am.
[165:08.30]We're going to take the first break of the night and potentially the only break of the night, depending on how much longer this goes.
[165:21.19]I'll be right back.
[165:23.07]And we will go from here.
[165:32.51]Oh, he got up.

[172:52.16]Photo of a dazzling golden fish.
[172:53.70]Where was it taken?
[173:04.39]Where is that?
[173:05.87]It's like a river coming down with a boat.
[173:07.91]It's a little dock.
[173:15.56]Wrong way?
[173:18.90]You need to use the crank to get that boat.
[173:21.00]Oh.
[173:28.85]Oh yeah, this is empty.
[173:29.95]I forgot about that.
[173:35.43]Not anymore.
[173:40.91]Snowy.
[173:41.39]Yeah, it's a snowy place.
[173:47.03]How do implantation notes?

[175:52.31]No, I have to go this way.
[176:06.60]What was the point of coming all the way back here?
[176:17.35]Thank you, Joras, for the five.
[176:19.03]You know what we say.
[176:20.63]Alright.
[176:22.76]Community subs.
[176:23.32]Thank you.
[176:27.80]You're going back.
[176:28.66]Aren't I going towards his domain?
[176:31.04]No?
[176:47.73]Wait.
[176:50.73]Wait, what?
[176:54.53]Did I kill that guy?
[177:09.06]Oh, yeah, I have all the... Okay, so the thing that was... I'm confused because I got the four parts.
[177:14.66]But every time I've picked up one of the parts...
[177:18.29]It's like, oh, you thought you could leave?
[177:20.17]I don't think so.
[177:24.41]And I get laughed, oh, I'm trapped, and I have to do, I don't know, that's happened three times.
[177:34.74]He just told you that you could, alright, alright, yeah, he did, but I thought it was like a big trick or something, and I was gonna like walk down to the hallway, and it's gonna be like, oh, no, look out.
[177:47.42]Throw that face when you make that noise.
[177:49.14]No.
[177:49.80]Nope.
[177:52.93]I hate face cam because it lets you see the weird shit that I do.
[177:56.25]I don't want you to see that.
[177:58.95]Why would I ever have that on?
[178:00.11]There's no reason why I would ever want you to see that.
[178:27.65]What is it?
[178:27.95]Go back to Louise's house for treasure.
[178:31.98]I don't know how to get the Beneviento.
[178:33.96]Everbank treasure house.
[178:44.52]Oh, I'm going to just get out of here.
[178:46.18]Go to the cemetery.
[178:49.50]No, no.
[178:57.64]Crystal skull.
[178:58.28]Well.
[178:58.48]Well, let's do it.
[179:02.36]Okay, here we go.
[179:02.96]We have one, two, three.
[179:07.99]Examine.
[179:08.19]The six-winged unborn key.
[179:08.95]Flask of the torso.
[179:09.65]Oh.
[179:36.31]What was that?
[179:39.49]The flask of the arm.
[179:40.75]No content?
[179:52.46]The flask of the leg.
[180:00.44]And of course, the flask of the head.
[180:04.90]All that combined.
[180:11.91]Captain Planet.
[180:16.11]What?
[180:23.66]Let's go!
[180:24.28]I don't get it.
[180:29.90]There's nothing to get.
[180:31.88]A lone road.
[180:43.63]What does he have to say about it?
[180:45.83]I can choose something for you.
[180:49.87]A bigger shirt.
[180:55.97]At this point, you might as well just wrap a bunch of blankets around you.
[181:02.63]Okay, I have the flask.
[181:05.15]The completed crystal flask.
[181:09.09]Is there something here that I could do that I didn't do at the very beginning of the game?
[181:14.93]Resident Evil does this weird shit where, oh yeah, you remember this thing that you walked by like nine and a half hours ago?
[181:21.70]You can open it now.
[181:22.44]Told you.
[181:30.94]But what, which key goes in here?
[181:32.50]Really?
[181:38.89]Really?
[181:50.38]Louisa house.
[181:51.72]Go back to the field for Louisa house.
[181:54.38]I need the Louisa house key.
[182:04.17]Inspect the Louisa necklace.
[182:19.60]What's going on here?
[182:23.55]Under key items.
[182:34.38]Oh, say sorry to Duke.
[182:35.98]He doesn't have the necklace because he didn't go back to the house.
[182:40.39]Where is the Louisa house?
[182:44.93]Which one of these is the Louisa house?
[182:53.94]So... Alright, I... Hold on.
[182:58.66]Let me ask a question.
[183:01.18]All of you that have played this game before.
[183:07.16]How much is left of, like, the actual game?
[183:09.87]I've got the body thing.
[183:10.99]I've got the chalice.
[183:12.29]I'm about to go, like, open the door to, like, probably one of the last areas?
[183:18.17]Maybe, like, two hours?
[183:19.05]Three hours?
[183:19.43]Okay.
[183:21.53]Okay.
[183:23.62]Alright, so, well... It's like there's one, like, major chunk left.
[183:29.00]Okay.
[183:32.89]I'll go back and get this.
[183:34.31]Why not?
[183:34.87]I'll go back to the Louisa house and go get all this stuff.
[183:38.23]Scroll down in key items.
[183:51.04]Necklace stone.
[183:59.36]Inspect it again.
[184:00.20]Did I not put this in there?
[184:12.35]Precious stone that fell from Louise's necklace.
[184:18.25]Necklace with two holes.
[184:20.05]I can't put anything in here.
[184:23.61]Necklace with key.
[184:38.92]Okay, like, you can blame me all you want, but is anybody else getting a little irritated with the fucking janitor key ring that these games have turned into?
[184:51.15]I've got, I've had, I've had access to like 12 different keys.
[185:10.12]Caesar's Goblin.
[185:16.13]Yeah, fuck Capcom.
[185:19.35]No, that's not what I said.
[185:21.19]I'm just saying... That... I... Give me a keyring.
[185:26.58]Like a... With like 40 things on it.
[185:31.86]And when I get near an item that can be unlocked with a certain key...
[185:35.39]Have it glow green.
[185:37.51]Is that so hard to ask?
[185:38.55]I walk by a thing and it goes... Turn.
[185:43.10]Where is it?
[185:43.70]Where it's bright green.
[185:44.72]Like bright fucking green.
[185:46.44]Right?
[185:46.70]It'd be so much better.
[185:47.40]Oh, yes.
[186:03.43]Let's go open the house.
[186:04.72]That would be so shitty, I know.
[186:13.43]I want everything to be lit up.
[186:15.61]I want this to be like an Ubisoft game where I hit M and it shows every single thing on the map, every single little location, every like mailbox, everything.
[186:26.50]I want to look around and have to be like a blue line going that way, a red line going that way, a yellow line going that way, a green line going that way.
[186:33.36]And they all lead like to something else, to like an object.
[186:39.49]I just want to stare at the blue line while I go like this.
[186:42.21]I just don't even look at the video game.
[187:01.79]Okay.
[187:02.37]So, Louise's house is over here.
[187:04.81]We need to go... I can't go straight through because...
[187:10.08]Of that thing in the way, so I gotta go around here, and then out here.
[187:19.89]I want a game that plays for me.
[187:23.39]Thank you.
[187:24.83]Some people fucking get it.
[187:25.83]A lot of you don't.
[187:46.11]What is that?
[187:52.57]What is in here?
[187:53.07]Oh my god, where is it?
[187:58.68]What is this?
[187:59.02]Is it?
[188:10.91]I'm like frozen in fear.
[188:12.23]Hold on.
[188:12.53]I need to just go that way.
[188:17.42]Oh my god, it's a big guy!
[188:18.66]It's a big guy!
[188:19.28]Holy shit!
[188:53.94]I'm putting mine let's go show yourself I don't I can't even see him I feel like there's a bug in the room you know there's a bug in one of your rooms like in your house or your apartment or whatever
[189:21.02]Alright, we got to go in there.
[189:22.32]And I'm going to go in there with, like, pillows all strapped to my body and, like, a fucking ski mask on.
[189:27.39]And we'll see if he's in here.
[189:30.63]I don't know.
[189:31.03]I heard him.
[189:31.45]I heard him hit a wall.
[189:32.31]I don't know what wall he hit, though.
[189:42.74]There he is.
[190:01.74]Alright, let's go.
[190:02.58]I'm gonna trap him right here.
[190:05.38]Perfect thing I'm gonna do.
[190:06.24]Check this out.
[190:06.70]Ready?
[190:06.88]Now I'm gonna bait him into that.
[190:11.71]I hope I don't Wile E. Coyote myself.
[190:13.89]If I do, I'm gonna be very sad.
[190:32.62]Get in the house!
[190:33.14]Get in the house!
[190:33.64]Get in the house!
[190:34.13]No!
[192:02.28]Oh my god!
[192:02.90]I gotta f- You little dick!
[192:21.55]Where is he?
[192:26.73]Hey, come over here you big stupid alien!
[192:31.90]What a miss!
[192:33.84]I fucking missed!
[192:50.21]I hate this!
[192:56.51]Am I hitting him?
[193:14.71]Am I actually hitting him?
[193:32.22]Just use the magnum.
[193:33.14]No!
[193:51.46]It's called Wolfsbane.
[193:53.04]He regenerates all of his HP if you hide?
[193:56.88]No, he doesn't.
[193:59.11]Don't say that.
[194:21.26]I'm such a wuss, but I don't care.
[194:22.65]I'll win.
[194:23.39]Eventually.
[194:23.85]Remember, he resets if you hide.
[194:29.79]No, he doesn't.
[194:31.30]Stop saying that.
[194:32.14]Oh, a Wily Coyote!
[194:49.23]Stop!
[194:49.75]It's just a game!
[194:50.63]It's not even fucking real!
[194:54.86]It's not real!
[195:35.64]Wait crystal ancient beast Wait was that the that was the big one We're still ancient beast I thought that was just one of the way this visit there's different kinds I
[196:02.17]Alright, I've got the key.
[196:11.05]Can I do anything else?
[196:16.83]I can't go in the house.
[196:17.49]Can I wrap around?
[196:22.96]That was an exploit.
[196:24.04]How is that an exploit?
[196:24.74]I was hiding in the house.
[196:32.11]That was the treasure.
[196:33.55]Oh.
[196:33.67]Alright, well, I'm good.
[196:41.32]What difficulty am I on?
[196:43.14]Um, the one after Hardcore.
[196:45.68]I think it's called Satan.
[196:46.76]Alright, well, I guess I can't.
[196:53.54]I've already explored in here.
[196:54.44]I want to see what this thing's worth.
[197:03.76]Back to the church.
[197:04.84]We go around.
[197:06.54]Go around, go around, go around.
[197:09.78]It's worth 20k.
[197:11.16]I would be surprised if it wasn't at least 30 or 40.
[197:14.44]You don't get the crystal ancient beast.
[197:25.22]It's worth 80 grand.
[197:26.94]Is it actually?
[197:36.46]Hmm.
[197:37.26]Wow.
[197:42.67]Well.
[197:45.47]I mean, that's... I'll take $80,000.
[198:03.56]I need ammo.
[198:04.63]I have so much money.
[198:05.97]I'm gonna buy ammo.
[198:09.89]I need ammo.
[198:10.33]I have to buy it.
[198:12.05]Save money.
[198:14.71]Save money.
[198:15.39]I'm buying ammo.
[198:19.16]I'm gonna buy... 15 shotgun shots.
[198:30.39]I see.
[198:31.07]Anything else?
[198:35.75]I'm gonna buy... 15 sniper rifle ammo.
[198:41.89]I'm gonna buy... 15... Okay, I'm gonna buy two more.
[198:48.29]Without my shotgun, I'm nothing.
[199:04.28]I'm not walking into like the final act of the game with like 40 handgun bullets.
[199:08.82]No thank you.
[199:13.33]I got a lot of money.
[199:13.97]Alright, let's go.
[199:26.62]If you're nothing without your shotgun, you shouldn't have it to begin with.
[199:30.06]What is that a quote from?
[199:32.86]What is that?
[199:33.61]That's from, what are the rings?
[199:37.05]Oh, Frodo, if you're nothing without your chainmail, then you shouldn't have it to begin with.
[199:41.53]What is it from?
[199:43.91]Gandalf says that to Frodo or something.
[199:45.51]Gandalf says it to, like, Pippin.
[199:47.18]I'm nothing without my, uh, my wand, or whatever, Harry Potter.
[199:51.44]Gumbledore says it to Harry Potter.
[199:53.86]Right?
[199:54.46]Well, if the wizard cannot be without his wand, then he shouldn't be a wizard to begin with.
[199:59.68]And he just forced lightning at him.
[200:03.90]Spider-Man.
[200:05.74]What's going on?
[200:10.47]Oh, yeah, it was.
[200:10.93]If you don't think... If you don't think without... Hold on.
[200:13.33]If you don't think without... I can't do fucking Robert Downey Jr.
[200:15.99]Whatever.
[200:16.61]That was awful.
[200:17.31]That was so bad.
[200:28.76]I was trying to do, like, the... Look around.
[200:30.64]Eyebrows.
[200:31.00]Look around.
[200:31.64]Nothing without eyebrows, you know?
[200:34.27]You should look around and be cool and have sunglasses and have your eyebrows.
[200:37.03]Go like that.
[200:38.27]I couldn't do it though.
[200:38.85]It's too much to do.
[200:51.52]If you're good at something, never do it for free.
[200:55.79]If you're nothing without your eyebrows, then don't ever do it for free.
[201:07.82]Hey, wait!
[201:08.58]I wanted to... Doll grave?
[201:17.89]Uh, it's alright.
[201:19.27]You can't get every treasure on the first playthrough.
[201:21.87]Photoshop his eyebrows.
[201:25.19]Yeah, Photoshop my eyebrows off.
[201:26.79]Let's see what I look like.
[201:30.16]And it will give you more, like... Hold on.
[201:55.95]Is that a good spot?
[201:57.09]Yeah.
[201:57.49]I'm coming.
[201:57.89]Wait, did I miss any secrets?
[201:59.05]Thank you for being funny.
[202:01.75]Well, thanks.
[202:03.09]Ooh, this looks good.
[202:25.27]It's running flawlessly on my GTX.
[202:29.55]Oh, no, it's RTX.
[202:30.94]I keep saying GTX.
[202:32.52]Oh, come on, then.
[202:36.84]Don't worry.
[202:37.32]It's not a trap.
[202:57.06]What are you planning?
[203:04.74]Blood's just splattered there.
[203:06.52]He falls into the window.
[203:07.56]Got him.
[203:22.91]Is there anything I can grab out here?
[203:24.29]Probably not.
[203:45.64]Okay.
[203:54.06]Ooh, gunpowder.
[203:55.18]Don't go down there yet.
[204:00.74]It's possible there's more shit.
[204:09.19]I didn't even touch... This is a weird, like, invisible wall.
[204:15.15]I don't know.
[204:27.78]I dislike this part of the game entirely, but I'll watch you play it.
[204:30.69]Uh-oh.
[204:31.21]Does that mean you're gonna get a shitload of complaining?
[204:36.09]Am I about to just, like, talk a ton of shit and be really mad that I'm playing this?
[204:42.46]Links are disappearing.
[204:43.68]Yeah, they are.
[204:47.93]Yeah, links are just... Okay, there we go.
[204:50.23]Get a mod here.
[204:55.14]Jesus.
[205:04.81]Yeah, that's horrifying.
[205:06.41]Why does my... My eyes look so weird.
[205:09.71]Why do my eyes look weird?
[205:10.59]I don't know why my eyes look so weird.
[205:18.93]I mean, that's fucking clearly gray.
[205:22.06]That's absolutely gray.
[205:23.24]There's gray in there.
[205:47.81]Who do I look like?
[205:51.89]This is one of those really easy spot the difference from Highlights Magazine.
[205:56.41]What do I look like?
[206:25.88]Who do I look like?
[206:28.60]Wallace and Gromit?
[206:31.08]Why do I get that?
[206:32.10]Why do I understand what you mean?
[206:39.81]Who looks like this in Wallace and Gromit?
[206:44.79]You look like the Joker.
[206:45.69]It's because of clay.
[206:51.43]It's Wallace.
[206:53.15]Does Wallace... No, Wallace doesn't look like that.
[206:57.81]Like Deadpool?
[207:15.66]Deadpool?
[207:16.32]You just need a damaged tattoo on your forehead?
[207:24.04]Yeah, somebody put like the hands going like this.
[207:29.37]And add, and add, like, the, the, like, smile.
[207:40.10]That really adds the Joker.
[207:41.80]Alright, well.
[207:43.52]See you in 20 minutes when somebody does that.
[207:56.89]Okay.
[207:58.48]Are we in a good spot?
[207:59.48]No, I need to be moved a little bit down.
[208:03.06]Better.
[208:04.68]Better.
[208:06.94]Good.
[208:07.98]Eyes.
[208:11.74]Okay.
[208:16.25]You look like Gary Oldman.
[208:19.39]I don't know.
[208:20.19]When you take eyebrows off somebody, they look crazed.
[208:25.41]Eyebrows is one of the things that just kind of shapes your face.
[208:28.70]And I have big eyebrow bones.
[208:30.70]So I have these huge, big, like, caveman eyebrow chunks.
[208:35.40]Without eyebrows, they're just there.
[208:38.08]Okay, let's go.
[208:53.15]Big reveal.
[208:53.87]What the hell?
[208:56.45]Mia?
[208:59.26]Truth hurts, don't it?
[209:03.89]Let me guess.
[209:05.51]You're thinking, take me out like the others, and then he gets going, save Rose, right?
[209:11.63]I'm healing my daughter.
[209:14.05]Look, you got this all wrong.
[209:23.28]Shut your fucking hole!
[209:26.58]I'm sorry about that.
[209:29.08]Why are these all so weird?
[209:30.10]I don't want to take a seat, but you can push me into the dungeon thing.
[209:34.60]You're going to kick me and spar to me into the hole.
[209:38.14]What are you talking about?
[209:39.76]You think this is a game?
[209:40.60]I said sit!
[209:49.69]Lady.
[209:50.57]Supersize bitch.
[209:53.19]Ugly as a psycho doll.
[209:55.49]An anemonic freak.
[209:58.77]Don't you get it?
[210:01.07]It's a test.
[210:02.53]To see if you're strong enough to be a part of Miranda's family.
[210:05.09]I don't want to be a part of Miranda's family.
[210:07.15]Neither did I, but here we are.
[210:09.49]And I'm next in line, right?
[210:11.66]Kill me, move up the chain, we'll fuck them!
[210:15.84]I don't give a damn about your personal issues.
[210:19.04]I just want to fix my daughter.
[210:21.90]So do I. Do you have any idea how powerful a kid is?
[210:26.54]Even Miranda's scared of her.
[210:30.25]Glasses off!
[210:30.93]We can conquer the galaxy, you and I.
[211:00.58]Last chance.
[211:03.34]I saw that.
[211:05.58]I'll take my chances.
[211:09.81]Your funeral.
[211:19.77]Why didn't you take the deal?
[211:20.65]What the hell is this guy?
[211:31.45]God.
[211:37.21]Okay.
[211:37.63]Here we go.
[211:45.70]Whoa.
[211:46.00]He can get through.
[211:50.88]Crouch.
[211:51.14]What are you doing?
[211:52.00]Crouch.
[211:58.54]Good.
[211:58.78]Trash chute.
[211:59.32]Go.
[212:11.82]And then both of his hands get cut off.
[212:15.09]We have no hands again.
[212:16.13]It's like a junkyard.
[212:21.25]Alright, cool.
[212:28.19]Gunpowder.
[212:34.45]Oh, I thought that was him peeking his head over.
[212:43.64]It was sus.
[212:47.96]What's this?
[212:55.61]Oh, more scrap.
[212:56.21]Good.
[212:56.91]Okay.
[212:58.75]You would figure there'd be a shitload of scrap in the scrapyard, right?
[213:05.76]Something just brushed my leg.
[213:06.68]There's something alive in here.
[213:08.93]Chewie!
[213:09.63]Chewie!
[213:10.03]Something alive in here, Chewie!
[213:11.13]Wait, were they even in that part of the movie?
[213:14.97]I've mixed up that entire movie.
[213:19.65]Like, all three of those movies are just the same kind of 13 seconds in my brain.
[213:24.08]Now we're gonna have to go in there.
[213:34.01]I got a VR- I think I have VR helmets on?
[213:47.36]I blocked for the first time in the whole game!
[213:49.09]Wow, that's useful.
[214:05.29]I need ammo.
[214:11.53]Oh yeah.
[214:21.21]They were playing Fortnite VR.
[214:24.60]I hope they had a good Victory Royale.
[214:36.38]Ethan.
[214:49.26]What is this?
[214:52.68]Escape the factory.
[214:56.12]This looks... Are they producing these people?
[215:05.77]These people are being just produced.
[215:08.63]That's kind of crazy.
[215:09.99]Cool.
[215:10.37]Alright.
[215:10.71]Whatever.
[215:10.95]Let's go.
[215:12.49]We got a huge area right here.
[215:17.61]Oh, thank goodness.
[215:18.56]I'm glad to see you.
[215:22.36]Welcome, Ethan.
[215:24.38]I'm very glad to see you.
[215:27.86]Oh, valuable.
[215:29.24]Alright.
[215:30.32]I got a lot of money.
[215:31.45]Little and often fills the purse, as they say.
[215:36.17]Oh, shit.
[215:36.67]Inventory increase.
[215:37.47]Nice.
[215:38.47]I'll take one of these.
[215:39.15]Oh, this is like the... This is it.
[215:45.69]This is it.
[215:46.23]This is the final upgrade.
[215:51.30]New gun?
[215:53.98]What do you mean new gun?
[215:56.24]Whoa.
[216:02.61]G61 Custom.
[216:04.93]SYG-12 Shotgun?
[216:07.39]Sell this.
[216:16.53]And then I'll go buy the new one.
[216:36.65]Just upgraded it.
[216:37.49]Yeah, well, I'm going to get the money back.
[216:40.17]Go.
[216:41.63]A semi-automatic shotgun.
[216:52.23]Hell yeah.
[216:56.96]Oh, look at this thing.
[216:58.96]Already at 1160.
[216:59.50]Alright, I definitely want... More capacity.
[217:05.46]Leave this to me.
[217:16.93]I like the handgun.
[217:19.97]I actually like the handgun better.
[217:24.30]I don't want this thing.
[217:34.44]Buy the new handgun.
[217:35.36]Not yet.
[217:35.66]200 damage?
[217:38.71]Yeah, I know.
[217:39.19]I got 180.
[217:39.81]I'm good.
[217:40.49]I like this one.
[217:42.33]It's more powerful.
[217:43.63]But I like that one.
[217:49.39]Can I even buy it?
[217:49.95]I think it's overpowered.
[217:54.52]But I don't want it.
[217:55.82]I'll get it later.
[217:57.66]It's full auto.
[217:58.44]Yeah, I don't like full auto.
[217:59.34]I like to line up magnum, shotgun, and pistol like my favorite weapons.
[218:04.77]Because you just get to go boop, boop, boop, boop.
[218:08.73]I don't like boop.
[218:09.93]It's too hard to control.
[218:16.61]An interesting selection.
[218:26.51]Look at this thing.
[218:28.17]This thing's sick.
[218:33.58]If I come across some more money, I'll come back and I'll do it.
[218:36.18]I promise.
[218:38.58]But for now, I want to upgrade that shotgun.
[218:40.30]Okay.
[218:44.61]So, is this an elevator?
[218:46.29]I guess I can use the elevator, but what's over here?
[219:08.09]Something in here?
[219:09.55]They're like keeping something closed in here.
[219:18.31]Some kind of locking mechanism.
[219:19.47]Looks easy to break.
[219:20.45]Let's test it out on this guy.
[219:39.24]Pretty damn good, if you ask me.
[219:40.66]Alright, what do we got?
[219:57.63]A lot of places to go.
[220:00.53]Can't be opened from here.
[220:01.49]There's not enough power, okay.
[220:12.66]Let's go get power.
[220:18.84]Ethan.
[220:20.88]Double tap.
[220:27.65]Gimme.
[220:41.77]Ethan.
[220:42.37]Goku.
[220:44.81]Goku.
[220:45.57]Well, that was 3,000 bucks.
[220:46.59]That was good.
[220:52.13]Alright.
[220:57.15]I'm probably gonna make some more ammo for the handgun, because I really do like it a lot.
[221:05.50]His brain?
[221:11.36]Pause the game, I have to pee.
[221:12.56]Sure.
[221:12.74]You have a few minutes?
[221:17.89]I would say you have a minute.
[221:18.65]Maybe one, maybe two.
[221:20.49]Okay, so something goes here.
[221:26.72]Some, like, square metal object?
[221:31.02]Or some mold?
[221:47.42]Did I just miss three times?
[221:48.36]So, what's the... Are they making, like, weird, like, soldiers or something?
[221:59.65]I don't understand.
[222:04.45]I've played almost every single Resident Evil game.
[222:09.23]And I still... I don't understand what the whole point is.
[222:14.91]All I remember is like, oh, yes, we have this virus.
[222:17.31]It's a virus.
[222:18.60]And it's, we need it to have, we need, okay, we have a virus.
[222:24.18]I don't remember, like, why there was ever a virus.
[222:25.88]It's just like, oh, we made this virus to make, uh, because.
[222:31.57]A bioweapon.
[222:34.83]Right.
[222:35.49]But, I mean, over, like, like, 30 straight years, the bioweapon shit never worked.
[222:44.94]Like, we've got 8, 9, 10 video games of them failing to make a bioweapon.
[222:53.06]Like, can't we just go back to fucking swords and shit?
[222:56.14]Like, I don't... Like, we're still looking for a bioweapon.
[223:00.44]Oh, wait, see, this is the 5G virus.
[223:03.07]The T virus.
[223:03.95]The B virus.
[223:04.99]The A virus.
[223:06.05]The tyrant virus.
[223:06.93]Like... Wesker, it didn't fucking work.
[223:10.23]It's not working.
[223:11.55]It doesn't work.
[223:15.69]How many times do we have to do the make a parasite virus thing?
[223:23.72]Oh god.
[223:25.22]What the fuck is that thing?
[223:26.58]Looks like there's not enough power.
[223:39.66]Oh, I hated the chainsaw guys in 4.
[223:45.17]Oh, they brought the chainsaw guys back.
[223:47.13]I hate these fucking guys.
[223:48.79]Except it's not a chainsaw guy, it's a drill guy.
[224:09.61]Release the mold.
[224:28.38]He's blocking.
[224:28.94]He's blocking.
[224:29.44]He blocks.
[224:40.83]Wait for him to swing and then do it.
[224:42.36]Holy shit!
[224:42.92]Does he lunge?
[224:43.44]Did that hurt?
[224:57.44]Crystal Mechanic Heart.
[225:01.95]That was not that bad.
[225:03.39]It was just a little startling.
[225:13.74]What is this?
[225:14.18]I could fit in the depression.
[225:16.50]Oh, it's this thing.
[225:24.60]I get back from my pee break and you're already playing?
[225:26.54]No, this is just, we're just doing hypothetical stuff.
[225:28.27]I'll reload.
[225:30.13]I was just testing new weapons.
[225:31.83]Dude, just, we were testing new weapons.
[225:42.52]Relief of a horse.
[225:45.42]I wonder if that goes here.
[225:51.59]It does.
[225:51.95]Open the secret passageway.
[225:58.11]But don't go yet.
[225:59.39]Because there could be other things here, right?
[226:02.87]No, nothing.
[226:03.49]I can't do anything yet.
[226:04.11]Alright, let's go.
[226:10.78]Testing speedrun strats, yeah.
[226:15.15]Scary.
[226:24.07]Just... Oh my god.
[226:26.65]Fucking blow his head off.
[226:42.40]I need ammo bad.
[226:52.29]What is 864P?
[226:54.21]Don't click it, dude.
[226:54.89]Don't click it.
[226:56.04]Don't touch it, man.
[226:58.60]I don't know.
[226:59.56]It was there.
[227:00.92]To me, that seems like fucking really... I'm skeptical of that.
[227:04.22]Don't touch that.
[227:05.84]It just showed up today.
[227:07.03]I feel like it might be the fuck of your computer.
[227:12.56]Like a horse key.
[227:15.72]Yeah, we need a horse key.
[227:23.09]What's in there?
[227:25.71]Oh, there's a weapon cache in there.
[227:27.75]The final weapon of the game.
[227:28.68]It's going to be the lightning gun.
[227:29.88]I need ammo.
[227:38.86]Good.
[227:41.62]I should have just bought a shitload of ammo from that guy.
[227:43.50]You got it?
[227:55.79]Somebody got it?
[228:31.44]this looks like like a little kid got into like the red velvet birthday cake early and is now trying to figure out he's he googled like how to bake a cake he's so nervous concerned about it I don't know why he doesn't have eyebrows like mom's coming home in 15 minutes how do I bake a cake
[229:04.32]Raid?
[229:04.76]Who came in with a raid?
[229:06.25]There's a double raid?
[229:07.23]What just happened?
[229:10.83]Raid?
[229:11.11]I'm like, get that off the fucking screen right now.
[229:14.79]Get that off the screen.
[229:16.51]Turn that off.
[229:19.79]Fundy just came in with a 13,000 viewer raid.
[229:25.07]Holy shit.

[229:27.29]Welcome, everybody.

[229:41.78]So, I hope you had a good stream, Fundy.
[229:43.47]Thanks for the raid.
[229:48.23]Sing the raid song.
[229:50.90]No.
[229:52.02]No, that's too many people to embarrass myself in front of.
[229:54.18]But, hey, what's going on?

[232:22.60]No, it doesn't.
[232:24.14]It's fun.
[232:26.06]What is that?
[232:26.50]I don't know what I did, but I turned something off.
[232:40.57]You're doing good.
[232:41.47]Hey, thanks.
[232:51.54]open he spent 20 well I I brought I spent like about maybe 12 hours at the first village part yeah this is about what 29 27 hours of game time
[233:05.84]I'm a completionist.
[233:07.58]I do like 100% of every game, essentially.
[233:11.20]I'm kind of like, people have called me the wizard from Vegas, you know, because I get in, I figure out everything, and I figure out all the completion routes, and I try to get everything as fast as I can, 100%.
[233:24.50]They call me the game wizard from Las Vegas, is what I've been called before.
[233:30.07]All the new people here.
[233:36.46]Oh, God.
[233:41.56]Like, if there's something to figure out in the game, you know I'll find it.
[233:44.66]Alright, well, that's a shortcut back to there.
[234:04.20]Oh.
[234:16.24]Can we jot that down for the VOD?
[234:19.20]The timestamp here?
[234:20.14]Because I want to make sure I put that in the video, like the thing that I found for the completion of stuff.
[234:25.54]So this is how you get to the mechanical part cylinder.
[234:27.34]Somebody just said, shut up.
[235:04.88]It's taking a good mental picture of exactly the layout of this map.
[235:12.20]So I can remember it.
[235:12.86]100% of it.
[235:23.69]I really don't want to... Okay, here's this part.
[235:36.55]Remember, this is so obscure, everyone's going to think you're a fucking weirdo.
[235:39.03]What are you talking about?
[235:47.01]Why would you say something so weird?
[235:48.59]You're, like, scaring people off.
[235:50.70]Fully grown male corpse used to remove heart in an implanted kadoo.
[235:54.52]Muscle stimulation via electric shock was successful.
[235:56.76]Brain dead, so no high cognitive ability.
[236:00.30]Only moves by destructive instinct, then stops.
[236:02.18]Okay.
[236:06.08]Attached headgear to the cranium.
[236:07.52]Electrodes confirm stable brain waves.
[236:10.79]Experiment 1.
[236:11.21]Lichen fight.
[236:11.97]Was dismantled and eaten within 3 minutes.
[236:16.47]Mechanical soldier.
[236:17.35]Soldat.
[236:19.35]Replace lower part of the arm with drill.
[236:21.21]Not enough output for effective movement.
[236:23.25]Need live bodies perhaps.
[236:27.81]Implanted Kadoo reactor into the chest.
[236:29.97]Output greatly increased.
[236:31.89]Lichen fight.
[236:32.37]Destroy 3 lichens in 1 minute.
[236:35.69]Results with issues with reactor durability.
[236:37.63]May stop functioning when reactor is destroyed.
[236:39.17]Okay.
[236:44.37]Cog mold.
[236:50.30]We have to make it back to the co- Alright, we have to go back to the cog room.
[236:54.28]Which that might be really, really- How am I hurt?
[236:58.78]I'm like very injured right now.
[237:04.97]Fog mold?
[237:10.68]Alright, where... Where was that?
[237:14.64]Is there a mold somewhere?
[237:18.46]Casting?
[237:18.98]Okay, there's the casting machine.
[237:20.28]And then here's the switch.
[237:21.33]Casting machine.
[237:24.65]I just gotta go straight through.
[237:26.63]Here comes a... They're gonna all wake up.
[237:28.21]One, two, three, go.
[237:30.01]It's gonna go... Oh, I told you.
[237:59.81]Ah!
[238:01.95]What?
[238:02.13]That didn't hit?
[238:05.81]Why are they getting this close to him?
[238:22.23]Nice!
[238:24.15]I just Mortal Kombat default beat that guy.
[238:35.32]a cog now where was there a cog is there some other door that I didn't see it's a cog door somewhere I have no idea where
[239:11.63]Hog door.
[239:17.09]I'm kind of lost.
[239:39.09]Did you unlock the sugma dick door?
[239:41.67]No, not yet.
[239:59.50]Is it this thing?
[240:00.14]No.
[240:17.51]Objective, terminate Jeremy.
[240:19.57]Who's that?
[240:20.01]I'm kind of lost.
[240:31.62]I might as well just turn these off so I don't have to worry about it.
[240:41.77]Let's go, the gaining wizard.
[240:43.51]Yeah.
[241:03.44]Uh, yeah, I'm kind of lost.
[241:04.22]Those are gaming wizard strats, yeah.
[241:16.10]Turning off those things for no reason.
[241:39.38]Use the map?
[241:42.67]There's nothing on... The only two things on the map... This is a switch right here.
[241:45.69]And then there's the... The mold.
[241:55.11]Is it this way?
[241:56.53]No, I don't... No.
[241:59.85]Use the mold.
[242:00.95]What?
[242:04.42]No, I already... I got the large cog.
[242:14.10]Can we get a wizard diaper check, please?
[242:17.84]Sure, yeah.
[242:18.48]I think it should be okay.
[242:25.67]I don't have to take a break yet.
[242:26.85]Is it up here?
[242:36.07]I forget.
[242:45.93]Not in here, is it?
[242:49.34]Where is this place?
[242:50.34]I really don't know.
[242:54.82]It's not this, right?
[242:55.58]This is a switch, but should I just go and see if I can flick a switch?
[243:00.92]That's a reused bad joke.
[243:02.18]That's a reused really bad joke.
[243:13.31]Is T on the map?
[243:19.57]Lift controls.
[243:21.43]It says B3, MB3, MB4.
[243:33.18]I just don't know where to go.
[243:35.02]I don't remember.
[243:36.90]Backup generator.
[243:37.90]Honestly, that could have been like three or four years ago.
[243:43.71]Generator level.
[243:44.49]Okay, I need to go B4?
[243:48.47]So where am I right now?
[243:52.44]I'm on MB4.
[243:54.02]I need to go to B4.
[243:55.66]It's in the dark room the drill guy came from?
[244:01.87]I was just in there, wasn't I?
[244:02.93]Not enough power, okay.
[244:22.07]Is it just, like, here somewhere?
[244:23.27]Dude, just play Among Us.
[244:32.69]Down the stairs in the second drill room.
[244:40.36]Is the backup generator next to the drill guys?
[244:50.10]Like, the time where they're all on the wall.
[245:00.70]Use your brain, check the map.
[245:02.74]Is this why the person said this place sucked?
[245:04.20]They said I really hated this place, but, like, I'll watch you play it?
[245:07.75]Is this why?
[245:17.33]Where are those?
[245:17.97]You said the guys that are on the wall?
[245:19.37]I don't even care if you backseat for this part.
[245:21.99]I really don't.
[245:23.28]I don't care if you backseat a lot of the time, actually.
[245:26.30]It's right there.
[245:27.06]Yes, probably.
[245:27.84]Near where that secret door you blow up with the pipe bomb.
[245:31.74]I don't... I don't even... I have no idea.
[245:34.50]Adjacent to the mold room.
[245:36.00]I don't even know what that is.
[245:38.72]Generator.
[245:39.36]Susky.
[245:39.90]Lost in another concrete building.
[245:44.52]Back in the mold room through the door behind the table behind the tape behind the table behind the table Engine room This is why like I hate when there's like three four five levels like up and down.
[246:09.77]Oh
[246:12.57]It just confuses the absolute hell out of me.
[246:14.24]I don't even, like, underst... Like, I did what... Where I need to go, I did, like, so long ago in my brain, I don't even remember being there.
[246:24.48]Blue hallway, top of foundry.
[246:27.82]Like, here.
[246:41.91]Blue hallway.
[246:42.67]They don't have this key.
[246:50.14]I just ran past it?
[246:59.41]What?
[247:02.51]The hall with the hang drill guys take a right to the generator and use the cog.
[247:12.67]Okay, take a right and use the cog.
[247:15.63]Here's the guys with the fucking wall.
[247:25.86]Here, like through here.
[247:29.16]Cog, Jeremy, the cog, the vent.
[247:31.12]Left, no, left.
[247:33.66]I can't go left.
[247:35.62]I can't go left.
[247:41.09]Stop moving for a second.
[247:42.15]Okay.
[247:44.23]Left at the clown.
[247:50.02]This is your brain on drugs.
[247:51.04]No, this is your brain on... Let's keep backtracking in all of our games because people remember how much they hated this shit.
[247:58.08]So let's do it a different way this time.
[248:10.48]No.
[248:10.76]No.
[248:15.24]In here?
[248:15.68]In here?
[248:22.18]Down here?
[248:25.60]Cog is an admin.
[248:26.52]I walked by it.
[248:27.42]I'm getting... I am getting fucked with.
[248:29.68]Give me this goddamn factory map.
[248:40.23]Stop at the mold door.
[248:46.35]Okay, here's the room where you guys are telling me to go to.
[248:48.63]Stop at the mold door.
[248:53.57]Just before the stairs in the guy divot drill guy.
[249:05.46]Down here.
[249:28.04]This place sucks.
[249:29.30]I don't like this place.
[249:31.90]You move back to, like, the big swamp where, like, I can see everything.
[249:34.66]Concrete rant.
[249:45.89]Yes!
[249:46.27]It is disappointing.
[249:52.17]Like, every wall looks like I'm inside of a goddamn motherboard.
[249:55.23]I can't even pay attention.
[249:58.87]She locked us away in the village.
[250:02.29]Decades of being forced to serve her.
[250:06.68]Can you even understand that?

[250:57.78]That- that's the- that's the- I'm half paying attention to our conversation.
[251:02.30]I don't even know what you just said, but I'm gonna give some kind of reply to make it seem like you think I was listening.
[251:10.41]Wow!
[251:10.77]Holy shit!
[251:14.81]Crazy!
[251:17.93]That's crazy!

[251:31.11]What the fuck?
[251:31.93]Alright, alright.
[251:40.69]I gotta pay attention.
[251:47.32]I don't want to get attacked.
[251:55.12]Wow.
[251:56.08]Holy shit, dude.
[251:57.88]Wow, really?
[252:00.44]Oh my god.
[252:01.38]That's a good one.
[252:02.48]Oh my god.
[252:06.11]Here, I'll give you a good example.
[252:08.27]So, if somebody goes... You go, oh my fucking... Oh my god, dude.
[252:17.37]What the fuck?
[252:18.57]Oh my god is useful when you hear a little bit of inflection at the end.
[252:22.34]If the voice raises a little bit.
[252:26.25]You say, oh my god.
[252:27.12]What's that?
[252:44.19]What else is in here?
[252:45.09]Uh-oh.
[252:46.09]I found you.
[252:55.49]He's gonna go through the ground.
[253:03.53]OH MY GOD I GOT DRIPPED!
[253:05.33]No, they got me in a pickle!
[253:07.54]Shit, I just got caught in second base!
[253:13.74]I'm still alive, right?
[253:14.80]Fight each other!
[253:45.23]Get out of the way!
[253:45.75]I'm trying to shoot him!
[253:57.10]Mines don't hurt you.
[253:59.11]Oh, that's... That would have been really nice to know that.
[254:03.13]Stupid Jeremy idiot brain.
[254:20.24]Cool.
[254:20.58]Wow, that's a lot of money in there.
[254:31.52]Actors.
[254:55.61]I'm almost completely out of ammo.
[255:03.63]I'm gonna have to start hitting people with a knife.
[255:05.19]Alright, I need to make... I need shotgun ammo.
[255:27.77]Yep, and you're not even halfway through the level.
[255:29.45]Oh, that's not good.
[255:32.25]That sucks.
[255:40.51]What's this?
[255:44.95]Why is this in here?
[255:52.54]That guy's gonna wake up.
[255:57.08]Wait, can I just shoot him in the heart right now?
[255:58.58]I don't know why I didn't think he could get through that.
[256:26.96]There was no way he could get through that in my brain.
[256:28.76]I don't know why.
[256:29.16]It was like, I thought it was safe.
[256:31.82]Okay.
[256:45.15]So, now... Get no ammo.
[256:53.39]I gotta pee again, too.
[256:54.41]That's not good.
[257:00.21]Anything... What's my actual goal right now?
[257:10.93]You know what I mean?
[257:11.79]Like, what's my goal?
[257:15.42]Escape the factory, I guess.
[257:16.86]But... I guess... What does that mean?
[257:20.44]I guess vibe.
[257:22.72]Okay.
[257:34.04]What's that?
[257:34.38]Can I go that way?
[257:42.71]No.
[257:42.81]You getting lost again?
[257:55.06]Yeah, probably.
[257:56.04]I'm back in this room.
[258:03.42]Um...
[258:06.02]I have to open this door by pressing some kind of button.
[258:10.53]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, please fart.
[258:15.37]No.
[258:19.70]I mean, there's definitely something I have to activate over here.
[258:31.99]I'll take it.
[258:35.64]Why did I go backwards?
[258:38.86]This is a really confusing area.
[258:40.81]I'm not trying to go backwards.
[258:48.13]Backwards is forwards in my brain.
[258:51.07]Everything looks exactly the same.
[258:52.57]It's more like the concrete metal fucking walls and shit.
[258:59.01]A bunch of machinery in the middle.
[259:00.35]Every room is machinery in the middle with concrete and steel.
[259:15.44]Alright, I remember this.
[259:26.10]Did I go this way?
[259:26.88]I mean, I killed everything here.
[259:30.79]Up...
[259:45.96]I'm gonna go back up the stairs And you notice it's like the spatial shit too it's like everything's just this this I can't see anything It's just every this somebody said it everything looks just looks exactly the same Like put some fucking balloons and shit like what I put some fucking statues or something I
[260:15.30]So I can know, oh, I remember the balloon room.
[260:17.44]That guy's got two.
[260:24.67]Wait, his heart's not showing.
[260:26.39]Why?
[260:26.61]It's in his head.
[260:39.18]Is it in this?
[260:39.58]No, it's on his back!
[261:08.76]Rock on shells.
[261:10.02]Oh thank goodness.
[261:11.54]Thank you.
[261:11.98]Thank you.
[261:12.36]Thank you
[261:18.72]Thank goodness.
[261:20.88]A trusty shotgun.
[261:33.67]Power!
[261:40.23]Use the map if you're getting lost.
[261:41.46]My problem with the map is just it...
[261:44.89]These just look like Tetris pieces.
[261:47.37]You know what I mean?
[261:48.11]It's just like, oh, this is just... I guess that's just a hallway.
[261:51.25]It doesn't show all the machinery.
[261:52.71]There's no balloons.
[262:02.52]He hates Tetris and Capcom.
[262:04.42]Yeah.
[262:08.47]I'm only playing this game out of spite.
[262:11.54]Every time we turn the corner, we're gonna make fun of it.
[262:13.20]Like, oh, whoa, scary.
[262:14.82]This is what we do in this channel.
[262:17.74]We pick, like, the fucking games and companies we think is stupid.
[262:21.20]And, like, oh, yeah, we, like, pretend, like, oh, look at me.
[262:23.48]I'm playing through this shitty game, right?
[262:25.71]It's wicked funny.
[262:27.61]Oh, look out.
[262:28.67]A guy with a drill?
[262:29.75]Oh, wow.
[262:32.07]Right, guys?
[262:47.74]I was just pretending to be scared like Capcom sucks.
[263:07.42]Somebody said, what do I mean?
[263:08.08]Wow, yeah, Capcom, what are we, back in the 30s?
[263:09.96]What do you mean the 30s?
[263:11.18]Like, technology?
[263:14.72]What?
[263:16.38]The 30s?
[263:23.52]Play Tetris and hate Capcom.
[263:27.03]No, I don't hate Capcom.
[263:29.05]Resident Evil 2 is one of my favorite games.
[263:32.17]Probably, probably the last five years.
[263:39.18]The remake.
[263:40.32]The remake.
[263:53.34]Open it, dude.
[264:01.04]Okay.
[264:01.48]Okay.
[264:02.14]Okay.
[264:03.43]Okay.
[264:09.93]What's wrong with you?
[264:10.63]What?
[264:15.98]Hey!
[264:28.47]I'm fine.
[264:29.23]Alright.
[264:29.73]This is really important.
[264:30.91]I have to buy a bunch of ammo.
[264:38.08]Apologize for killing Igor.
[264:42.04]I killed Igor.
[264:43.80]I would do it again.
[264:46.30]If you resurrected Igor right now and put him in front of me, I would shoot him.
[264:51.83]And then I would have you bring him back again and I'd shoot him again.
[264:55.35]Ooh.
[265:12.33]Okay.
[265:13.41]Important.
[265:16.69]I can only buy sniper rifle ammo from you.
[265:23.20]Alright.
[265:23.62]I'm gonna... Give me the new gun.
[265:27.70]Give me the new gun.
[265:29.64]I can afford it now.
[265:32.22]This is my favorite gun.
[265:34.00]I'm about to delete it.
[265:34.77]Okay, give me the new one.
[265:44.66]I suppose you'd call this a farewell to arms.
[265:52.92]Okay.
[265:55.54]It's got 200 ammo capacity.
[265:57.12]That's going to get better than that.
[266:00.18]Reload speed.
[266:01.24]Reload speed.
[266:01.98]Okay.
[266:15.36]Buy ammo?
[266:16.20]He doesn't have any.
[266:20.86]Oh, he has his sniper ammo.
[266:22.20]I can't afford it.
[266:22.90]I'm in trouble.
[266:29.53]Is this thing not good?
[266:36.91]Shit.
[266:42.08]Wrong gun?
[266:42.54]No, it's not.
[266:47.32]I need rusted scrap.
[266:49.09]I need more handgun ammo.
[266:50.05]I need more everything.
[266:52.59]Rotate your saves.
[266:55.29]Actually, I'm in trouble.
[267:06.28]Oh, I have 15 magnum shots.
[267:08.08]I am perfectly fine.
[267:13.81]I am going to be 100% fine.
[267:15.35]I'm going to have 20 magnum shots eventually here.
[267:19.63]Nothing will kill me.
[267:20.85]I will be invincible.
[267:40.91]Look at explosive rounds.
[267:42.67]Yeah, look at this.
[267:50.47]Alright, that looks good.
[267:53.01]Very good.
[267:53.31]Okay.
[267:55.75]Tetris inventory?
[267:56.45]Yes.
[268:02.80]Alright.
[268:03.30]Do I have reloaded every gun?
[268:04.28]As much as I can, I guess.
[268:07.22]Alright, let's go.
[268:09.86]Craft ammo.
[268:10.46]Stop telling me to craft ammo.
[268:11.37]I can't.
[268:16.41]Could've upgraded the 1911 into the killer.
[268:19.15]Whatever.
[268:21.69]Okay.
[268:23.09]My next goal is to... I guess we go down.
[268:27.31]So I'm going to go to another floor.
[268:29.05]We're going to go to... Wait.
[268:31.17]Should I go... Where are we?
[268:35.30]Can I press this button?
[268:37.38]Isn't I already on B4?
[268:38.12]Can I open this door?
[268:52.39]Hey, Red Panda, thanks for the 11 community subs!
[268:59.09]So I want to be on B3.
[268:59.91]Okay.
[269:15.92]He's going to regret selling that gun in 10 minutes, am I?
[269:18.20]This thing just does more damage, doesn't it?
[269:23.24]Yes.
[269:33.78]It's just better.
[269:34.30]I thought it was just better gun.
[269:41.79]So, well, you twerk.
[269:44.21]It's not the song.
[269:55.99]I think at the end of this tunnel... Oh, you don't even put like a gem or something here?
[269:58.97]Like a jewel?
[270:02.49]Then why aren't we... We should be on the same team.
[270:32.28]Why would I hate this gun?
[270:33.10]This thing's awesome.
[270:44.51]This thing's beautiful.
[270:55.46]You haven't made a sound since the stream turned on.
[270:58.28]Do you know that you're muted?
[271:03.68]That would be so stupid.
[271:07.56]There's no way that Twitch chat would let that go for more than five minutes.
[271:21.47]We can't hear you, man.
[271:22.76]We can't hear you.
[271:31.89]You can hear me just fine.
[271:43.63]There's two over here.
[271:50.45]You know what I meant.
[272:07.42]Lockpit.
[272:11.07]That was pretending to be scared.
[272:12.53]You know, it's funny when you watch somebody play a game like this.
[272:19.34]Even like a friend of yours.
[272:23.26]There's something about watching somebody playing a scary game and startling things versus actually doing it yourself.
[272:29.57]Because I've watched friends of mine play scary games and they go, they scream and I'm just like, I'm sitting here watching you.
[272:37.03]Why are you so scared?
[272:38.45]That wasn't that scary.
[272:41.15]Really?
[272:41.61]That was your reaction?
[272:43.09]But when you're actually locked into the matrix, it's a lot different when it's you being attacked.
[272:49.75]Because this is an extension of me.
[272:51.43]Someone just attacked me.
[272:53.25]I, sitting on the couch, am watching somebody just get attacked.
[272:55.54]It's not even... It's not me.
[272:57.58]Like, you are... You might have the first-person perspective, but you are watching me get attacked.
[273:02.52]You're, like, from a distance, pretty much.
[273:04.58]You're, like, 50 feet away.
[273:06.80]That's why.
[273:16.06]Let's go.
[273:20.78]Is that true, dude?
[273:21.86]You get really immersed when you play it yourself?
[273:29.24]Yes.
[273:29.86]And this is a circle.
[273:31.30]This is a square.
[273:32.14]This is a rectangle.
[273:35.44]Look, it's basic.
[273:36.56]Alright, whatever.
[273:37.14]Alright, that was pretty basic, but you know what I mean?
[273:42.67]That's true, though.
[273:56.68]Hyperbomb.
[274:05.59]Yellow quartz.
[274:06.25]Large crystal.
[274:07.93]Large crystal.
[274:09.39]Oh, finally.
[274:10.77]Some money.
[274:11.29]So low on ammo.
[274:20.48]It's crazy.
[274:21.48]More explosive rounds.
[274:22.32]More.
[274:22.54]More.
[274:27.18]I don't know if you're like, nope.
[274:31.56]More!
[274:31.72]More!
[274:32.99]More!
[274:33.67]My favorite part of all the movies.
[274:39.73]Everybody thinks, no, just when Darth Vader and Luke like me.
[274:42.21]No, mine's more!
[274:43.83]That's my favorite part of every single Star Wars movie.
[274:47.51]And he goes, more!
[274:49.79]More!
[274:50.61]And he does like a, more!
[275:02.39]Cap gun, this is a cap gun ammo I'm not gonna shoot that last one yet that this is a this is like a fight This is a big fight get everything first
[275:34.30]Look at this.
[275:34.60]Are you kidding me?
[275:35.28]Are you telling me this is not a fight?
[275:36.70]A big one?
[275:37.08]I'm going to collect everything first.
[275:49.40]Fuck.
[275:58.21]Fuck.
[275:58.89]Oh, fuck.
[275:59.51]Oh, my God.
[275:59.83]What do I do?
[276:02.45]Oh, my God.
[276:02.85]What have I done?
[276:03.65]I'm in trouble.
[276:05.92]Oh my god, I'm in deep shit.
[276:06.96]I'm in deep shit now.
[276:07.80]I'm in deep shit.

[276:31.92]Oh, fuck you!

[277:23.23]Oh gosh.
[277:43.98]Fuck!
[277:45.64]Oh my god, what the hell?
[277:49.79]He's jumping!
[278:08.16]Oh, lucky break!
[278:09.48]That's what we call a lucky break!
[278:28.59]Whew!
[278:39.70]There's items down here.
[278:40.45]I think I got it.
[278:55.36]Very necessary.
[279:01.24]A gaming wizard from Las Vegas.
[279:04.42]Yeah, people are calling him the gaming wizard from Las Vegas.
[279:07.39]This Twitch streamer.
[279:09.88]made quite a name for himself.
[279:13.98]You see, he shit his pants in a diaper on stream and didn't get up to clean it.
[279:19.95]He was subsequently banned from the platform.
[279:22.59]Sorry, the teleprompter was a little slow, sorry.
[279:40.46]Didn't that actually happen to Ster?
[279:41.58]Yes.
[279:44.50]Ster and I were playing.
[279:45.42]I believe one of us was streaming.
[279:47.10]And he shit his pants.
[279:51.66]We were playing a game of Overwatch.
[279:53.36]Ster shit his pants.
[279:57.02]Sitting there, like, on stream.
[279:58.27]Like, we were streaming it.
[280:00.49]And didn't get up.
[280:01.53]And he waited till the end of the round because it was very important.
[280:03.81]Because it was a very important game.
[280:07.53]So he was just, I, he, yeah, that happened.
[280:10.61]And he sat there for like, I think like 30 minutes.
[280:15.82]And I'm like, oh, funny, like you made that up, right?
[280:18.34]You guys like make shit up like that.
[280:19.76]No, no, no, we're not.
[280:21.06]No, that really happened.
[280:22.62]That really happened.
[280:30.58]Was it a whole shit or just a wet one?
[280:32.32]I don't, I'm not going to answer that because I don't know.
[280:37.03]And that's a gross thing to answer.
[280:38.29]I don't know.
[280:38.79]It was a long time ago, too.
[280:39.93]Ugh, he is such a funny motherfucker.
[280:45.37]I swear to God, he really is.
[280:51.77]Hey, look!
[280:52.59]Attached to jetpack and head stabilizers to a Soldat.
[280:55.68]Greatly improves mobility.
[280:58.54]Experiments prove limited flight capabilities.
[281:06.02]Attached aluminum alloy shielding to assault that to protect chest reactor and exposed flesh.
[281:12.70]Experimentation, whatever.
[281:14.48]We experiment.
[281:19.14]Don't change the subject.
[281:20.33]There is no more subject.
[281:22.41]Ster shit his pants live on stream on I don't remember what stream didn't get up and sat in it for like 25 to 30 minutes I think he actually left the stream too I think he was like I gotta go it was like alright I think he turned his stream off that's it that's the whole story there's nothing else for you to know there's nothing else you need to know for that story it's over the story has ended
[281:50.59]Stop pretending like we haven't sat in shit before.
[281:53.05]I don't think that's ever happened before to me.
[281:55.74]Is there a link for it?
[282:01.10]Where is it?
[282:01.42]Can a mod link me?
[282:08.82]Is it actually archived?
[282:14.25]Why are you exposing him?
[282:15.83]He told this story on stream!
[282:19.63]This is not like, I'm not exposing Ster, he like shit his pants.
[282:23.69]Ooh.
[282:25.06]You really stepped in it, mate.

[293:24.61]While you work.
[293:26.01]Alright, let's go down.
[293:26.87]Let's make the mold.

[301:43.55]How is that not hitting him?
[301:53.52]How much does it take to...
[301:57.76]No, no magnum.
[302:04.51]See, what a waste of a magnum that would have been.
[302:07.99]Perfect crystal mechanical heart.
[302:18.86]Get me the hell out of here.
[302:33.63]Am I going the right way?
[302:34.23]Am I going the right way?
[302:48.72]No, of course not.
[302:49.72]Oh.
[302:56.30]Gotta use the magnum on this guy.
[303:01.78]Oh.
[303:04.09]I tried to fucking run.
[303:06.21]Just run?
[303:06.89]No, I want the money.
[303:20.58]Whoa!
[303:21.52]What the fuck?
[303:22.40]Stupid mechanical bullshit everywhere.
[303:24.94]Put a fucking generator in the middle.
[303:26.33]Put a generator on the left side.
[303:27.67]Put a, stick fucking mechanical generators in, generator, put a generator there.
[303:34.98]Die motherfucker Generator mechanical machine generator stick him in here give him this much space to walk.
[304:00.85]Oh
[304:31.31]Leave.
[304:34.43]Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
[304:41.19]This gamer grease on your forehead?
[304:42.59]No, it's not.
[304:45.73]That's just the lighting.
[304:53.48]Alright, that's 50 grand.
[305:00.92]That was worth it.
[305:01.96]That was actually worth it.
[305:02.84]I'm glad I did it.
[305:04.32]Heisenberg's hammer.
[305:05.68]45,000.
[305:06.37]I'll take it.
[305:11.60]Alright.
[305:15.06]Here we go.
[305:16.90]This is all an investment, Ethan.
[305:19.34]So... If I increase this capacity, I will get 14 shots.
[305:25.85]Worth doing.
[305:28.51]What?
[305:29.81]Ah, it's fine.
[305:30.57]All finished.
[305:35.21]Power?
[305:35.45]Yeah.
[305:37.47]Leave this to me.
[305:40.95]I'm gonna do power.
[305:41.79]I'm gonna do power on this too.
[305:47.60]Or ammo capacity.
[305:54.22]This simple modification can be done in just a moment.
[306:02.79]Good day then.
[306:10.09]14.
[306:10.11]Alright.
[306:21.22]I'm going to switch this to flashbangs and use them.
[306:24.29]Because why not?
[306:28.37]Our saves ammo is better than capacity.
[306:30.01]You know, that is actually probably true.
[306:35.98]Alright.
[306:37.24]Now we have to go up.
[306:39.36]Open that other door.
[306:40.18]And I'm assuming this is probably one of the major fights of the whole game.
[306:44.68]More damage you do, less ammo you use.
[306:49.42]That's right.
[306:59.24]As long as I hit my shots.
[307:03.94]Well, I've got about 13 or 14 magnum shots to make.
[307:09.22]Let's hope I make them.
[307:10.00]Two heals.
[307:15.43]I wonder if I'm gonna be able to do this.
[307:16.83]Let's find out.
[307:21.73]Jump over the railing.
[307:38.87]Holy shit.
[307:46.92]Well, that helped a lot.
[307:49.82]Thank you, one guy.
[307:53.84]Thanks a lot.
[307:59.77]That actually really helped a lot.
[308:07.87]How do I get it back up?
[308:10.93]Oh, this is a zipline.
[308:21.35]Anything up here?
[308:21.83]Oh, shit.
[308:28.10]Nice.
[308:28.70]Okay.
[308:34.96]The one guy giveth and the one guy taketh.
[308:40.99]One guy giveth, and one guy taketh.
[308:43.11]Might as well just do this now.
[308:45.97]I want it.
[309:17.53]Oh.
[309:18.73]It's time.
[309:19.29]Mm-hmm.
[309:20.87]Final fight with Heisenberg.
[309:38.06]Sniper, rifle, ammo.
[309:39.06]What are they giving me?
[309:39.70]Alright, first aid.
[309:40.92]Ammo, ammo, ammo.
[309:46.79]Honey.

[310:15.95]Just avoid him.
[310:16.77]He's invincible from the front.
[310:18.61]Let him run out of gas.
[310:20.27]And then shoot him with a shotgun into his spinal cord.
[310:25.23]Got it.
[310:31.40]Okay.
[310:35.22]Make sure everything's loaded.
[310:43.80]I have the Magnum if I need it.
[310:44.86]I have rockets if I need it.
[310:45.98]I have a bunch of mines and shit.
[310:47.51]I'm actually going to put mines.
[310:51.53]Isn't he invincible from the front?
[310:53.01]Wouldn't mines be kind of a waste of time here?
[310:58.47]I know.
[311:07.84]What?
[311:08.22]Wait, what?
[311:18.44]What the fuck is happening?

[312:34.39]Okay.
[312:34.59]Let's go.
[312:40.62]Oh, we'll have to do this shit again.
[312:44.08]Come on.
[312:45.34]Come on.
[312:59.81]Okay, so he breaks the wall.
[313:01.97]And then it's just a case of just let him run out of gas and shoot him in the back.
[313:05.09]Let's go.
[313:06.57]One, two, three.
[313:08.05]Power.
[313:08.55]Power.
[313:10.75]Power.
[313:11.13]Power.
[313:11.42]Power.
[313:12.14]Power.
[313:12.44]Power.
[313:31.82]Okay, why is it... Okay, well, whatever.
[313:33.88]Why is it not broken?
[313:35.32]Holy shit, he can turn!
[313:43.25]Oh my god!
[313:44.31]I'm in trouble.
[313:44.79]I'm in trouble.
[313:45.15]I'm in a lot of trouble.
[313:45.75]I'm good.
[313:54.71]You alright?
[313:55.13]What's that mean?
[314:03.55]Oh, he's like in super mode.
[314:11.23]Oh my god, what's happening?!
[314:15.32]Oh fuck!
[314:26.72]Oh fuck, oh fuck!
[314:35.00]Oh my God.
[314:35.94]Just run out of the way.
[314:39.84]He's burning me.
[314:40.44]He's burning my skin.
[314:48.42]What am I doing?
[314:55.64]What the fuck?
[315:03.13]Oh, he's pissed again.
[315:23.93]Mines?
[315:24.43]Use mines?
[315:41.66]Where's the mine?
[315:42.16]Did he break the mine?
[315:53.63]Did he break the mine?
[315:55.35]Is the mine still there?
[315:58.27]It's not there anymore!
[315:59.09]He broke it!
[316:41.39]Stop destroying my mines, you fucking asshole!
[316:50.45]He's not dead?!
[317:01.12]Take a photo.
[318:02.16]Oh, you killed my little toy.
[318:04.43]You're next.
[318:06.47]Snake.
[318:06.89]That's what he sounds like.
[318:08.31]He sounds like the snake guy.
[318:17.89]I didn't have to even use a revolver.
[318:19.57]That's good.
[318:25.19]Cigar.
[318:28.05]Miranda is abominable.
[318:30.11]Her deceit knows no bounds.
[318:31.99]We're merely a bunch of failed Kadoo experiments to her.
[318:36.09]I was just lucky I had more affinity to the stuff than the other poor schmucks in the village.
[318:41.18]So she still calls me her son.
[318:42.98]What a joke.
[318:43.44]I'll never forgive her for what she did to me.
[318:45.42]That crazy bitch has never been right in the head.
[318:48.24]She can't see a difference between experiment and family.
[318:51.24]Miranda didn't just change my body, she took my dignity.
[318:55.80]If I don't kill her, then my life will never be my own.
[318:59.32]Still, she may be crazy, but she's also powerful.
[319:01.58]She can turn into anyone using the Mega Me Sight.
[319:06.72]The trick is that brat Rose.
[319:09.54]If I could access her power, then maybe.
[319:12.12]Speaking of the kid's dad, Ethan has a pretty interesting body himself.
[319:14.98]Maybe I could get him to help me out.
[319:16.76]Okay.
[319:24.74]What else you got in here?
[319:29.32]in this room.
[319:30.38]What's in this very room?
[319:32.00]Okay, chem fluid.
[319:43.85]Let's see what I can do here.
[319:46.83]I can't do anything.
[319:48.57]Great.
[319:57.11]It continues.
[320:03.05]This looks like another bo- Wait, is this like a back-to-back boss fight or something?
[320:12.13]It's not a back-to-back fight, is it?
[320:16.69]The boss rush?
[320:18.26]Oh, that sucks.
[320:33.01]Anything else over here?
[320:33.67]Um, not really.
[320:40.20]Okay.
[320:52.99]In one of these things, right?
[320:53.97]One of these little... Let's go.
[321:10.86]Alright.
[321:12.76]What do we got?
[321:28.31]Yeah?
[321:31.55]Lightning outside?
[321:32.23]There's nothing in here either.
[321:45.74]Oh yeah, he can like bend metal and stuff, right?
[321:50.80]He's got like magneto powers.
[321:51.90]I feel like I did that.
[322:14.27]What the hell?
[322:25.21]That's a dog from Half-Life.
[322:37.59]That was cool.
[322:47.05]He used all the junk metal.
[322:48.74]Why wouldn't he just kill me?
[322:57.38]Like, why not just kill me?
[323:07.45]Shoot me.
[323:07.83]Stop, like, getting rid of me.
[323:17.81]He wants me to join.
[323:18.65]Yeah, he wants me to join his little group or whatever.
[323:22.27]I don't know what it is.
[323:32.99]I told you to leave it alone, Ethan!
[323:40.42]You are in the way.
[323:42.02]What do you care, Chris?
[323:43.84]You killed my wife, you son of a bitch.
[323:45.64]You think I killed Mia?
[323:46.54]You didn't take the grenade launcher, Chris.
[323:48.18]It wasn't her.
[323:50.73]It was Miranda.
[323:51.93]What?
[323:54.41]She's a bioweapon.
[323:56.85]She changed her appearance and pretended to be Mia.
[324:00.13]Seems she also survived a few shots and now I'm here to finish the job.
[324:04.35]Bullshit.
[324:04.69]Why don't you fucking tell me right away?
[324:07.57]Because I knew you would want to be involved.
[324:10.76]This job is hard enough without civilians getting in the way.
[324:15.76]Can't wait till we get the Chris files where you play like his side of the story.
[324:19.65]What the hell is going on?
[324:20.91]DLC.
[324:24.73]Alright, Ethan.
[324:26.84]Alright.
[324:28.68]I guess I owe you an explanation.
[324:32.84]Hand me that wrench.
[324:48.65]Long story short, Miranda's fucking insane.
[324:51.89]In this village, all these monsters and freaks, this is their life's work.
[324:57.37]Some sort of crazy experiment with the mold.
[325:01.71]The mold.
[325:03.05]Like Louisiana.
[325:04.82]God damn it.
[325:06.44]All this time, I thought I could save my family.
[325:09.56]I can't escape from here.
[325:12.40]I can't do anything.
[325:13.30]That might not be true.
[325:20.04]Take a look at this.
[325:22.92]My men sent those pictures a few minutes ago.
[325:24.95]Miranda.
[325:26.17]Keep looking.
[325:29.77]Don't go too far, though.
[325:30.75]Don't go too far.
[325:31.91]Holy shit.
[325:32.45]We gotta go.
[325:33.09]Relax.
[325:33.65]My men are monitoring the situation.
[325:35.55]But they have my daughter.
[325:37.57]You don't get it.
[325:38.35]You don't stand a chance against Miranda by yourself.
[325:47.02]That's the most nerve-wracking thing ever when somebody has your phone.
[325:48.94]I will stay down here and finish planting explosives.
[325:51.38]You take that elevator.
[325:52.46]I'll meet you topside.
[325:53.45]When you say, hey, look at this picture.
[325:54.59]I promise you, we will get you.
[325:55.57]And they go, oh, cool.
[325:57.17]Together.
[325:57.65]And they swipe.
[325:58.33]And they swipe.
[325:58.71]Damn straight, Neil.
[326:00.05]And when I find Miranda.
[326:01.31]Don't do that.
[326:03.01]She's a dead woman.
[326:04.45]That's all I wanted to show you.
[326:05.21]Just that one photo.
[326:06.51]I don't want to show you anything else.
[326:07.99]Alright, Ethan.
[326:09.93]Then you take this and do me a favor.
[326:13.73]Try to stay under the radar.
[326:21.07]Why does he have like a Wesker lookalike costume on?
[326:35.53]Found Wolf Squad.
[326:36.51]The sweep of the factory is complete.
[326:37.75]No proof of any connection with the organization.
[326:39.73]Guess this just wasn't our day.
[326:43.27]I did manage to get my hands on a number of documents disclosing some of Miranda's experiments, which support our previous theories.
[326:48.80]She seems to have infected herself with the Mutami site, which grants her a number of abilities, including mimicry.
[326:56.49]She can control her cells and transform herself to look like anyone or anything.
[326:59.83]So that could have just been her.
[327:03.46]She disguised herself as Mia and infiltrated the Winter's home.
[327:07.53]Her objective was to kidnap Rose.
[327:09.33]Maybe she thought she could control Rose easier if she looked like her mom.
[327:12.55]When we attacked, it put a little damper on her plan, so she mimicked a corpse.
[327:19.56]But is she the guy that's been lying around?
[327:21.14]You remember the guy that I keep saying, like, hey, this guy's, like, in every scene.
[327:25.70]Why is he lying down on the ground?
[327:28.96]Is that her?
[327:32.14]She then revived herself from the transport truck, killed everyone on board, and took off with Rose.
[327:36.99]Things didn't go the way she had originally planned, but in the end, she still got what she wanted.
[327:40.47]Until now.
[327:42.69]It's time to rendezvous and blow this place sky high.
[327:46.01]This might turn into a fight with Heisenberg, but I think I found something useful.
[327:50.49]He left one of his little toys laying around, and it's even made from a metal polymer composite.
[327:57.56]You can't control.
[327:58.30]Time to turn the tables.
[328:01.65]Tank fight?
[328:03.37]Got ourselves a tank fight.
[328:06.90]There's shit in here.
[328:07.62]I don't want to leave without it.
[328:08.66]Maybe this will save me some ammo.
[328:21.37]Okay, let's go.
[328:23.07]Save the game.
[328:31.14]Why do I have to hold this for this long?
[328:35.34]That was a really long hold.
[328:36.78]Oh my god.
[328:40.06]Old ready cannon.
[328:40.56]Fire cannon.
[328:41.06]Guard?
[329:12.33]Do I have ammo?
[329:12.83]I have infinite ammo.
[329:20.40]Oops.
[329:21.18]Can I die?
[329:30.91]Reloading?
[329:31.57]Hurry up!
[329:39.17]Come on, come on, come on, come on!
[329:49.34]Alright, wait for it to reload.
[329:50.28]I don't want to go... Let's go.
[329:54.77]Oh, battle box!
[329:57.65]Start!
[329:58.37]Nice.
[330:01.39]Run away!
[330:21.81]Alright, right there.
[330:22.41]I see a weak point.
[330:25.71]Mom, I see a weak point.
[330:31.66]Oh, shit.
[330:32.20]That hurt.
[330:37.18]Ooh.
[330:38.24]Got it.
[330:38.60]Other arm.
[330:39.50]Oh, don't give up.
[330:54.29]Oh god!
[330:58.41]Watch out!
[331:36.06]I'm a goddamn superhero.
[331:38.20]Why do I have to shoot him?
[331:42.20]Why do you have to shoot him?
[331:45.73]Why do I have to shoot him in the head?
[331:54.25]Oh, is he up there?
[331:55.29]I can't even tell.
[332:00.58]What's wrong with the pace?
[332:14.87]What happened?
[332:16.87]Did I beat him?
[332:22.61]Chris has one too!
[332:23.93]What?
[332:24.25]Where should I shoot him?
[332:27.91]Where's his weak point?
[332:30.15]The head?
[332:53.74]And the eyes?
[332:56.98]Only fans?
[332:59.74]What do you mean only fans?
[333:05.12]What are you saying only fans for?
[333:08.82]Where is his body?
[333:10.32]Where do I have to shoot him?
[333:13.48]This is so anime.
[333:15.40]Am I shooting him in the head?
[333:26.01]Oh my god!
[333:26.83]Come on!
[333:38.44]Interest?
[333:43.89]I need more!
[333:48.37]Why?
[333:52.43]Shoot the flux capacitor.
[333:54.86]Here we go!
[333:59.57]Run away!
[333:59.93]Run away!
[334:00.23]Get behind that thing!
[334:00.93]Get behind that thing!
[334:01.57]Get behind it!
[334:02.01]Get behind it!
[334:02.37]Get behind it!
[334:02.73]Get behind it!
[334:03.45]Behind!
[334:03.67]Behind!
[334:10.27]Behind!
[334:10.61]Jesus!
[334:12.36]Oh my fucking god!
[334:17.62]Carry him.
[334:18.64]I get him?
[334:29.68]What am I supposed to do?
[334:30.51]I don't know, shoot him!
[334:39.83]Oh, fuck.
[334:42.35]So long, mutant waiters!
[334:48.76]You really should have taken my deal.
[334:55.90]You'll be frozen in the afterlife.
[334:59.86]What the fuck?
[335:02.48]Wait, what?
[335:04.69]What the hell?
[335:05.71]How would I have done that?
[335:14.67]This can't be the end for me!
[335:20.04]I must...
[335:35.23]Crystal Heisenberg.
[335:37.40]My phone is ringing.
[335:40.18]It's Mom.
[335:41.40]Mom?
[335:43.50]You did it, son.
[335:44.10]I saw you beat Heisenberg.
[335:45.46]That was very tricky.
[335:46.40]Rose?
[336:05.58]Mia?
[336:06.92]What?
[336:08.40]Our child.
[336:10.20]She's so important, isn't she?
[336:12.68]She's everything to me.
[336:16.20]And mine to me.
[336:18.71]With Heisenberg gone, you've lost your lead.
[336:23.47]What are you going to do?
[336:26.17]I don't know, but I'm saving Rose.
[336:28.73]You'd never know, do you?
[336:32.07]Even when I took Mia's place in your home.
[336:35.40]Poor Ethan.
[336:37.40]Who are you?
[336:38.24]Where's Rose?
[336:44.44]Granta.
[336:47.26]Enough.
[336:51.00]Remember Evelyn and her power over the mole?
[336:54.96]Rose is her successor.
[336:57.81]No.
[336:59.01]Rose is Evelyn's true, complete form.
[337:02.15]Oh, that happened.
[337:02.95]She will grow to fully control the masses.
[337:06.57]And I must have her.
[337:08.49]Fuck you, you crazy bitch!
[337:15.05]If that were a Magnum, I would be scared.
[337:17.30]But you don't have 15 bullets in that gun, do you?
[337:20.34]The Megami seat catalogs all of us.
[337:25.36]However, she will be reborn as my daughter.
[337:29.77]She's my child, not yours.
[337:34.39]Where are you?
[337:35.67]Show yourself!
[337:36.95]Why did Rose come to be here?
[337:39.57]Was it because of her parents?
[337:42.49]And you are truly a special case.
[337:45.81]But I've learned all I can from you.
[337:48.96]Your worth as a lab rat has run out.
[337:53.15]Miranda you coward come on and face me I Already have don't Your death will come quick you will join the Megamycetes records We'll turn that you would join the turbo lights.
[338:12.29]I Will make sure to sample your blood for nature.
[338:15.28]I
[338:17.01]Once dawn breaks, the ceremony will be complete, and I will become her true mother, bound for eternity in blood.
[338:38.25]I've waited so long.
[338:41.15]But dreams really can come true.
[338:47.04]I just took a picture of her.
[338:53.17]Whose perspective is this?
[338:56.55]The camera has sent it to us now?
[339:05.29]Oh shit, I'm just a camera.
[339:06.63]What am I gonna do?
[339:07.38]Take pictures.
[339:15.27]captain I've confirmed the death of Ethan winters I wasn't able to retrieve the body but I've recorded evidence is that it share your screen no and I'll go over this play as Chris and you probably fight my team and I were careless yesterday we took down the transformed miranda but we didn't kill her who knew she could fake being a corpse since miranda could have infected Ethan
[339:45.33]I forcefully took him and Rose with us.
[339:50.33]But the vehicle they were riding in was attacked.
[339:54.91]When I got to the wreck, Ethan and Rose were gone.
[339:58.21]Oh, that's not an ending.
[340:01.73]The last time I was able to contact Ethan.
[340:04.71]That's not the end of the game.
[340:05.43]I heard Miranda's voice.
[340:08.81]She murdered him.
[340:10.72]Is he driving?
[340:12.16]Chris!
[340:12.74]Why is he on the fucking road?
[340:18.67]god damn it when does it end what's that sir the mission all of it three years trying to put this thing in the ground three years too long I didn't use the magnum sir you're pretending to drive a car again like an action movie sequence
[340:51.84]Yeah, you play as Chris and you... I didn't use the magnum.
[340:55.06]I used it once.
[340:58.30]Oh my god.
[340:59.14]Mission adjustment?
[341:00.39]Can Chris at least take his stuff?
[341:03.23]Roger.
[341:20.92]K-9, I want to know what the hell BSAA is doing here.
[341:24.02]Find out what you can.
[341:25.18]Roger that.
[341:25.78]I'm on it.
[341:28.86]Been a while since we fought together, Captain.
[341:35.41]Fuck.
[341:36.83]When was it last?
[341:38.19]The desert?
[341:39.75]We're not actually gonna do, like, a, like... Ending.
[341:42.73]You know... Oh, no.
[341:43.63]No, I mean... They did this in the other fucking game.
[341:46.27]It's the part that I hated the most.
[342:07.00]And they, like, change your character and they take your whole inventory away and they make you do, like... I had 15 magnum shots to shoot and I don't get to shoot them now.
[342:16.92]The SAA.
[342:24.09]They've gone too far.
[342:28.89]Christ.
[342:30.29]Looks pretty rough down there.
[342:32.65]How are you planning on reaching the objective?
[342:35.02]I feel like that person could have corrected that.
[342:36.38]We're gonna have to take that thing out.
[342:38.28]You got your back, boss.
[342:39.00]Let's get to work.
[342:42.40]Everyone watch for hostile bioweapons.
[342:44.98]Roger.
[342:47.55]Hey.
[342:48.59]This is what I'm gonna do to this motherfucker down there.
[342:51.85]What about you, man?
[342:52.83]Let's see it.
[342:58.05]Made contact with a group of hostile bioweapons.
[343:01.75]It's good God Oh
[343:27.27]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[343:30.49]Just take fucking a million rounds.
[343:32.51]It doesn't matter.
[343:32.97]Go.
[343:42.79]Oh, shit.
[343:43.81]Let's move out.
[344:00.66]Oh, wait.
[344:00.98]We got a big guy.
[344:03.66]Big guy coming in.
[344:07.86]Don't worry.
[344:08.54]I got this.
[344:09.60]Watch your six.
[344:13.28]Watch out.
[344:14.18]We got a bogey here.
[344:37.12]Hey, boss, it's me.
[344:38.44]I'm at the location preparing for support fire.
[344:41.14]Might be a minute.
[344:42.14]Roger.
[344:43.30]Tundra here.
[344:44.10]Leaving some supplies in one of the houses.
[344:45.74]I have to... One of my supplies.
[344:47.82]I have to make sure... Alright, fishing on.
[345:00.93]It's clear.
[345:14.76]Keep going.
[345:18.46]Uh, boss, I got a well down here.
[345:30.39]No, I really, I really don't.
[345:37.84]I need backup.
[345:45.12]Oh wait, I'm kinda gonna look crazy here.
[345:46.94]This is .
[346:05.63]This 8.7 is falling.
[346:11.01]What is- What am I doing?
[346:12.19]What the fuck is this thing?
[346:14.03]Am I, like, trimming my nose hairs?
[346:16.15]What is that?
[346:20.35]Oh, nice, dude!
[346:32.84]Dude, what a killstreak.
[346:36.08]Anyway, UAV is online.
[346:37.92]Our UAV is airborne.
[346:52.45]What grabbed me?
[346:53.43]What?
[346:55.89]Whatever.
[346:57.55]What about this guy?
[347:01.56]Alright, Lobo.
[347:02.84]Marking the target.
[347:04.39]Roger that, boss.
[347:07.75]Where did that guy go?
[347:10.57]Okay, that guy's gone.
[347:11.49]Target acquired.
[347:19.74]I heard this game has low supplies.
[347:37.42]Shut up!
[347:38.90]I'm getting- I'm doing my terrible ending the way that I want.
[347:51.03]This dude is fucked.
[348:01.54]I go in here?
[348:05.20]Just point the laser at the target and leave the rest to me.
[348:07.76]What the hell?
[348:08.14]What do you want me to do?
[348:08.80]Point the laser?
[348:11.71]Oh, it's the nose hair trimmer.
[348:19.59]Bingo!
[348:19.91]Alright!
[348:20.89]You good?
[348:24.19]Reloading now.
[348:25.27]Just a minute.
[348:27.17]There's a swarm headed that way.
[348:31.10]There sure is.
[348:31.78]Say goodnight.
[348:40.92]What happened?
[348:42.94]Did I beat him?
[348:49.39]Hold on!
[348:49.73]Shit, no.
[348:50.31]Craig can't die.
[348:50.81]That's plot armor.
[349:17.72]Shoot the fucking gun.
[349:19.16]What the hell?
[349:20.77]Reload the weapon.
[349:21.77]Reload the gun, Christopher.
[349:26.15]Reload the weapon.
[349:48.47]Eat shit!
[349:50.15]Oh my, whatever.
[349:50.93]Did I get him?
[349:54.36]Why am I the only person that has the thing to do this with?
[350:00.07]Oh, come on!
[350:02.34]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[350:05.40]Got it!
[350:10.72]What the fuck happened?
[350:12.68]What did they... Oh, God!
[350:21.00]No, no, no, no!
[350:21.92]Run, run, run!
[350:22.54]This way, this way, this way, this way!
[350:23.82]No, no, that way!
[350:24.82]That way!
[350:25.12]Wrong way, wrong way!
[350:25.86]This way, that way, this way, that way!
[350:30.67]Where's the... There it is.
[350:34.79]Oh, come on!
[350:35.93]Fucking die!
[351:10.83]What the fuck even right here, okay?
[351:14.59]Do it here.
[351:15.53]Do it right here.
[351:16.62]Do it here.
[351:17.24]Do it on me do it on me Right there What?
[351:54.21]Just win?
[351:55.73]Shoot the tentacle.
[351:56.93]Reloaded, Captain.
[351:58.23]Ready for war!
[351:59.33]Wait, what?
[352:04.00]This is... Kill the fucking... No, don't shoot that!
[352:14.10]Which one?
[352:14.80]Which one?
[352:15.34]Where?
[352:15.82]Which one?
[352:16.28]What do I shoot?
[352:19.98]Take that!
[352:21.00]Good.
[352:21.62]The megamycete must be below.
[352:26.08]Alright, let's go!
[352:27.06]Let me through.
[352:36.26]Jesus Christ, that was terrible.
[352:45.54]No, it wasn't.
[352:46.06]It was fucking fun.
[352:49.00]I found a way down.
[352:50.38]I'm going in.
[352:50.96]The rest of you stay back.
[352:55.21]You did everything you weren't supposed to do.
[353:05.76]No, that's not even accurate.
[353:06.88]I did what I was supposed to do.
[353:08.08]It's fine.
[353:11.80]Okay, let's go.
[353:13.50]Got everything?
[353:16.32]Going down.
[353:18.59]You have enough ammo?
[353:20.27]I guarantee you I do.
[353:35.32]I have to fight this?
[353:36.64]Shoot to the roof!
[353:38.84]Ow!
[353:38.94]Bruce's legs!
[354:16.09]In the back.
[354:20.39]Blow it up!
[354:26.49]Get behind him!
[354:27.33]Get behind him!
[354:28.11]Get behind him!
[354:32.81]I'm overhead, boss.
[354:34.02]Good.
[354:35.10]I'll signal with the locator.
[354:36.70]Give a guy a break.
[354:42.70]Nice!
[354:43.32]I thought so!
[354:51.97]Get him.
[354:56.57]Oh, he hit me right in the head.
[355:05.34]Watch out.
[355:13.62]Right here.
[355:15.64]Right here.
[355:15.94]Right here.
[355:16.24]Right here.
[355:16.46]Get him.
[355:16.66]Get him.
[355:16.86]Get him.
[355:17.08]Get him.
[355:17.34]Get him.
[355:17.58]Get him.
[355:17.78]Right there.
[355:18.03]Right there.
[355:18.33]Right there.
[355:18.57]Right there.
[355:18.83]Right there.
[355:19.07]Right there.
[355:19.31]Right there.
[355:19.75]Right there.
[355:19.99]Go.
[355:25.69]What if I keep pointing down so he can... Flash damage.
[355:34.33]Blame Team Fortress 2.
[355:38.23]Okay.
[356:03.62]So if Miranda was the fake Mia, where's the real one?
[356:06.60]I doubt she saw any further use for her.
[356:09.72]I don't get any of this.
[356:11.10]How did Miranda even know Rose exists?
[356:13.72]A moldy little bird told her, maybe?
[356:15.94]We can figure that out later.
[356:17.98]Focus on the plan.
[356:23.34]I found it.
[356:24.82]It's the Megamycete.
[356:28.03]Crang from Ninja Turtles.
[356:32.79]Did I kill this?
[356:39.74]The best, uh, Tigger impression.
[356:41.82]Woohoohoohoo!
[356:43.22]I've located the Megamycete.
[356:45.42]So now we can end this mess after all.
[356:49.22]About damn time.
[356:58.85]N2 explosives armed.
[357:00.91]There's enough there to blow the whole village sky high.
[357:03.11]Let's get out of here and blow the damn place.
[357:05.09]Not before I end Miranda.
[357:06.29]I'm not taking any more chances.
[357:09.83]I'm going in.
[357:10.35]Roger that.
[357:11.85]Standing by.
[357:14.15]Captain, I have eyes on Miranda at the ceremony site.
[357:17.35]Keep your distance.
[357:18.69]Do not move until I give the order.
[357:21.51]I know it's too late now, but we really should have told Ethan the plan.
[357:26.11]There wasn't time.
[357:27.93]We didn't expect Miranda to act so soon.
[357:30.96]Even so, you should have told him.
[357:41.59]N2 explosives?
[357:44.18]I guess.
[357:44.92]There was no time.
[357:48.36]Yeah, I think there was time when we were sitting in the garage working as buddies on a father-son tractor project.
[357:54.74]I feel like you had a little bit of time to tell me.
[358:13.95]Oh, here we go.
[358:15.09]The final save point before the final boss.
[358:18.12]I know it.
[358:18.74]You know it.
[358:19.92]We all know it.
[358:28.09]Books.
[358:30.51]Mermaid.
[358:30.89]Got it.
[358:35.71]Subject.
[358:37.01]Salvatore Moreau.
[358:40.32]Kdo has caused drastic changes to internal organs, transforming them into organs similar to fish-like gills in a swim bladder.
[358:48.02]Another subject with irregular cell division caused him to transform into a giant fish.
[358:51.90]The subject is unable to control this transformation.
[358:53.60]Too many defects.
[358:54.54]An unfit vessel for Eva.
[359:03.79]Alcenia Dimitrescu.
[359:06.69]Dimitrescu.
[359:07.21]There it is.
[359:08.70]Okay, well that's Lady Dimitrescu.
[359:38.44]And then we've got, of course, Carl Heisenberg.
[359:42.30]Has electric organs similar to that of an electric ray.
[359:47.13]Eponica.
[359:50.99]These electric organs are connected to the subject's nervous system.
[359:54.85]Cool.
[359:55.67]Unfit, though.
[359:58.83]Try to put the book down.
[360:01.69]And then...
[360:05.38]Donna Beneviento.
[360:07.73]Physically, she's no different from a regular human.
[360:09.55]However, she can secrete a signal-producing substance which controls plants infected by the mutant parasite.
[360:16.79]When humans absorb the pollen from a particular flower, she can cause them to have hallucinations.
[360:21.61]However, she is mentally underdeveloped and has divided her kudu among her dolls.
[360:26.94]Hmm.
[360:33.95]There we go.
[360:34.29]That's an explanation for all the people.
[360:35.67]This is a Cadou.
[360:39.21]Cadou.
[360:39.83]Cadou.
[360:40.58]Hmm.
[360:40.80]Oh.
[360:40.86]Who's that?
[360:41.36]That's Miranda.
[360:52.26]That's Miranda.
[361:00.08]That's Miranda talking to somebody.
[361:04.45]That's Heisenberg.
[361:08.27]Heisenberg and friends.
[361:10.05]Dear Miranda, my deepest apologies for not meeting you in person.
[361:13.97]I would love nothing more than to visit your quaint village once more.
[361:16.46]However, I'm incredibly busy.
[361:18.36]Then again, I suppose for an immortal woman such as yourself, you no longer remember this poor half-dead medical student in the snow.
[361:25.15]I've always cherished the revelations I came to 15 years ago when I stayed in your village.
[361:31.25]I was inspired by your research to think one could transform a human by infecting them with an organism.
[361:36.91]Positively visionary.
[361:38.89]I know that with that knowledge I could achieve my own vision for the next step in human evolution.
[361:42.86]Even after the two world wars and humanity on the cusp of another that my conviction never wa- I stopped putting this on.
[361:48.88]I'm like just locked in like a train of thought.
[361:51.36]Too much on.
[361:53.80]I realize, however, through the many nights of intellectual talks you and I shared, that your conviction differed from mine.
[361:59.59]You hoped to bring back a single dead person, while I aimed to change the world.
[362:04.47]Your experiments on the mold would not have aided me in my endeavor to achieve an exponential infection.
[362:10.29]I thought a virus would be more effective.
[362:12.46]This is why, my dear, I had to leave you.
[362:14.58]I still regret never telling you goodbye.
[362:16.42]My apologies for reminiscing.
[362:19.06]I actually have the news that I thought might please you.
[362:22.82]I have found the key to evolution, the progenitor of virus found in Africa.
[362:28.48]I plan to start a company with friends and colleagues dedicated to the virus research.
[362:32.47]I would call it Umbrella.
[362:34.59]Just like the symbol in the cave that we spoke about.
[362:37.57]I'm one step closer to making my vision a reality.
[362:39.55]I hope you will be able to achieve your goal someday too.
[362:41.75]It taught me so much and for that I will be forever in debt.
[362:45.97]Sincerely, your lifelong student, Oswell E. Spencer Wesker.
[362:54.93]So wait, this takes place before... This takes place before, like, Resident Evil 4?
[363:01.65]Resident Evil 5?
[363:04.18]It's not Wesker.
[363:05.50]Yeah, it's his pen name.
[363:07.56]It's like R.L.
[363:08.24]Stine.
[363:13.44]Okay.
[363:35.98]Because the head's kind of distorted.
[363:58.53]What is this?
[364:00.25]The real Mia.
[364:01.51]The real Mia.
[364:03.41]Show me your hands!
[364:05.92]Umbrise, this is Alpha.
[364:06.92]Where is Miranda right now?
[364:10.58]Still at the ceremony site.
[364:11.74]Whatever she's doing, she's staying put.
[364:15.48]Goddamn.
[364:17.12]It really is you.
[364:20.12]I'm glad you're safe, Mia.
[364:22.18]Why are you here?
[364:25.70]I was caught.
[364:28.08]In Houston experiments.
[364:30.59]Wait, did you say Mia?
[364:31.99]Mia Winters?
[364:33.29]In the flesh.
[364:34.49]What's the situation up there?
[364:38.46]Don't get distracted.
[364:40.10]Stick to the mission.
[364:40.96]I'm headed to the ceremony site.
[364:42.94]Wait.
[364:44.62]You can't leave me here.
[364:46.10]You promised, damn it.
[364:49.44]You said that you would keep us safe.
[364:52.70]We did everything that you asked.
[364:54.46]We moved over here.
[364:55.48]Everything.
[364:57.76]And I didn't care.
[365:00.02]So long as we were together.
[365:03.01]So you tell me... ...WHERE... ...IS MY HUSBAND?
[365:07.01]WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER?!
[365:08.30]Ethan is... ...he's gone.
[365:15.79]I couldn't save him... ...but I CAN save Rose.
[365:21.25]Even though Rose is currently in four separate bottles.
[365:26.18]I have faith in my ability to be able to do that.
[365:28.60]I'm not a scientist, but I feel like I'm going to maybe put it back together.
[365:32.62]I tried to keep this a secret, but...
[365:53.12]I'm pregnant you don't understand how special he is oh I thought there was like another like baby or something that like I'm pregnant with another baby and this baby has like powers too wait I'm alive
[366:18.09]I mean, I guess we could have figured he was special considering his arms have been chopped off like five times.
[366:22.09]What's going on?
[366:28.01]Someone's there?
[366:28.73]It's cold.
[366:33.33]Is this supposed to be the afterlife or something if I get my body back?
[366:37.28]How did I get here?
[366:53.08]He's special.
[366:58.95]Was it me all along that had, like, the superpowers or something?
[367:01.91]Plot armor.
[367:14.38]You can even have your heart removed and you don't get to die.
[367:18.39]How are you here?
[367:19.63]You're dead.
[367:25.84]Nevermind, I can't take pictures.
[367:35.58]Dead?
[367:35.76]Dead!
[367:36.12]I mean, Miranda.
[367:39.73]See?
[367:41.91]No.
[367:43.43]I still have to save Rose.
[367:47.02]Wrong!
[367:48.24]It wasn't Miranda.
[367:50.42]You were always dead.
[367:53.82]What are you saying?
[367:54.70]I can still... Dead the whole time?
[368:02.83]See?
[368:04.13]Miranda didn't kill you.
[368:09.28]You mean you didn't think it was weird?
[368:13.12]Remember?
[368:30.94]He punched me in the face wicked hard and I died?
[368:34.88]That's when I died.
[368:36.36]Are you fucking kidding me?
[368:40.53]That's so funny.
[368:43.66]That's really actually fucking cool.
[368:45.92]That's funny He punched me in the face and killed me That's fucking funny
[369:00.68]You shouldn't be walking.
[369:04.34]Screw you!
[369:06.22]He stomped on your head.
[369:10.45]And that was it.
[369:11.49]I'm just dead.
[369:12.65]I... I... I did all that.
[369:19.91]Rose... Mia... I...
[369:33.59]I don't understand.
[369:47.22]Now do you get it?
[369:49.04]Your whole body is nothing but mold.
[369:55.05]You can't ever see your family again.
[370:04.85]What happens during the game over screen?
[370:08.51]No.
[370:10.63]Rose.
[370:12.67]I have to save my daughter.
[370:19.27]You're already dead.
[370:26.77]Dead.
[370:28.15]Where are you?
[370:28.63]Where are we?
[370:29.86]Where are you?
[370:31.16]Why are you here?
[370:32.10]I will...
[370:36.07]Save Rose!
[370:46.29]You're not paying attention to the story as a jo- I mean, I played Resident Evil 7 fuckin' three years ago.
[370:51.09]I didn't- I- I barely even remember this guy was a character.
[371:03.87]At last, he awakes.
[371:09.36]carriage Ethan you were having a nightmare Duke your battle with Heisenberg was a sight to see but to think Miranda would show herself how long have I been out not long till dawn Duke I need a favor yeah take me to Miranda
[371:37.30]I assumed as much and am already on the way.
[371:41.22]We should arrive shortly.
[371:43.86]Thank you.
[371:45.46]Is this the end of Duke?
[371:46.14]Are we going to see Duke get, like, killed?
[371:48.02]Are you sure of this?
[371:49.52]Your body is, well, falling apart.
[371:56.15]Yes.
[371:58.29]Foolish of me to ask.
[372:01.93]Speaking of foolish questions, who or what are you?
[372:07.31]Even I can't quite answer that.
[372:14.83]We're here.
[372:15.35]Can I buy anything from him?
[372:17.17]I owe you one.
[372:19.77]Mr. Winters, I'm afraid you can't return to your old world any longer.
[372:26.32]Are you ready?
[372:32.70]Wait, so what do you mean, my old world?
[372:34.88]I have to be.
[372:43.69]I actually really do have to go.
[372:44.89]So we're going to take a final pee break before I do this.
[372:47.85]I really have to go to the bathroom.
[372:51.33]Be right back.
[375:21.16]Alright.
[375:25.60]Let's finish this.
[375:28.36]Let's get to the end.
[375:28.96]I feel like I'm right there.
[375:33.21]Hello?
[375:35.73]Let's go.
[375:36.65]After I take a sip.
[375:48.70]Okay.
[375:48.80]Okay.
[375:51.17]Oh, yes.
[375:52.05]I've got it.
[375:55.15]Here it is.
[375:56.53]The Magnum.
[375:59.61]Let's get it on the bar.
[376:00.32]How many shotgun bullets do I have?
[376:08.92]Alright.
[376:13.51]Two is a rocket launcher.
[376:14.61]Let's actually... Why would I do flashbangs?
[376:16.73]I have 17 shots.
[376:20.41]I don't need a knife either.
[376:21.61]Okay, so let's go with... Sniper rifle on knife.
[376:29.14]Okay.
[376:29.36]Let me change this around.
[376:32.26]I want Magnum to be one.
[376:38.04]I want Rocket Launcher to be two.
[376:43.82]It is two.
[376:44.80]I want Shotgun to be three.
[376:45.93]It is.
[376:47.85]I want Sniper Rifle to be four.
[376:53.30]Let's do it.
[376:57.05]Duke, Duke.
[376:57.73]Oh, shit.
[376:58.43]Wait, I can actually buy stuff from him?
[377:02.23]One more time?
[377:04.61]Jesus.
[377:17.52]Just sell everything.
[377:18.24]I didn't get it.
[377:18.82]Yeah.
[377:19.26]Sell necklace with two holes.
[377:20.68]I didn't get it.
[377:21.64]Sell the cigar.
[377:23.61]Sell everything, right?
[377:25.19]Just buy a bunch of ammo.
[377:29.87]Sell everything.
[377:30.45]Yeah.
[377:31.83]Oh, the assemblage of life and machine.
[377:35.14]I can feel Lord Heisenberg's essence through it.
[377:40.62]Yeah.
[377:41.16]Okay.
[377:41.54]What are you thinking?
[377:44.16]Are you thinking magnum power?
[377:56.49]If I had 100,000, I would do it again.
[378:00.81]Oh, give me shotgun ammo.
[378:03.23]That was reckless spending?
[378:04.73]Kind of.
[378:07.07]Alright.
[378:08.21]Can I sell anything else?
[378:25.50]Okay, wait.
[378:25.90]What about... Oh, shit.
[378:30.62]Sell the handgun.
[378:31.48]Let's go.
[378:32.00]Sell the fucking handgun.
[378:35.04]I got $100,000.
[378:36.04]I can... Yeah, let's go.
[378:37.32]Sell the handgun.
[378:39.06]This is the handgun, right?
[378:42.27]I'm gonna do more power.
[378:45.19]I'm gonna sell the handgun.
[378:47.37]I'm gonna sell the handgun.
[378:48.35]I'm gonna... What do you mean?
[378:50.17]No, no, no.
[378:51.69]Why not?
[378:52.01]I'm not gonna use it.
[378:59.16]I'm not going to use this.
[378:59.96]Okay.
[379:05.07]I'm going to sell the handgun and I'm going to sell the fucking sniper rifle.
[379:07.75]What would I need it for?
[379:08.47]I want full power with the magnum.
[379:15.09]Here we go.
[379:15.33]Alright, this thing is insane now.
[379:31.00]Shotgun ammo power on the shotgun.
[379:36.56]Alright, let's go.
[379:48.06]Sell all ammo.
[379:50.57]That's right.
[379:55.03]Sell all the handgun ammo, all the sniper rifle ammo.
[380:10.77]Okay.
[380:10.91]Why are there all these categories for this?
[380:13.77]Sniper rifle ammo, get rid of it.
[380:21.84]Okay.
[380:24.52]I'm ready.
[380:29.04]And I'm going to replace it with... Let's get, like, a bunch of pipe bombs.
[380:40.05]Yeah, I'm just going to get a bunch of fucking pipe bombs.
[380:47.31]This is a troll?
[380:48.39]This is not a troll.
[380:51.82]Mine's too.
[380:52.38]Just in case this is a total fuck up, this is going here.
[381:06.80]So I've got 13 shots of like 2500 damage each.
[381:14.63]I've got 17 fucking grenades.
[381:18.25]And then I have a massively powered shotgun.
[381:24.20]I also have 7 mines.
[381:29.79]I've got five pipe bombs.
[381:32.30]I'm ready.
[381:32.96]I'm gonna kick the shit out of this lady, okay?
[381:36.48]Let's do it.
[381:36.92]Let's go.
[381:40.36]Shotgun first.
[381:43.54]Go.
[381:43.76]I'm ready.
[381:58.99]If you were right on this first try, I will drink a gallon of milk.
[382:02.23]Don't drink a gallon of milk for any reason.
[382:04.05]Just run.
[382:08.03]Why would I even shoot anything?
[382:09.02]Wait, do you have anything on you?
[382:10.34]Why do I care?
[382:10.84]It's the end of the game.
[382:11.40]Just run.
[382:11.68]Let's go.
[382:27.77]Little Ava, my beautiful daughter.
[382:33.66]Come to me.
[382:39.18]Ava, is that you?
[382:42.30]Oh, how I've missed you.
[382:54.33]wrong it's rose when you weren't looking I put rose's body parts into the machine rose
[383:11.36]I don't even have that gun anymore.
[383:14.90]Interesting.
[383:16.78]Your body certainly is normal.
[383:20.53]You've had a heck of a suck.
[383:22.63]Now!
[383:24.17]You will see.
[383:25.65]Once I kill you properly, everything... Get her, now!
[383:33.10]Chris, catch!
[383:37.04]I've spent a lifetime creating this moment.
[383:41.39]And you tried to take it away from me.
[383:43.27]I will take what is due.
[383:50.47]My desires will be fulfilled.
[383:53.26]Magnum.
[383:54.46]Rose is mine!
[383:59.10]What the fuck?
[384:05.89]Okay Magnum Magnum You disposed of my false children and awakened the glorious Now please do not worry for little Rose.
[384:21.52]I assure you I'll provide her with truth So now you can die peacefully
[384:29.70]And you can die.
[384:31.20]I'm skipping phases.
[384:33.33]We're missing dialog, I think.
[385:05.12]I gotta use spider sense.
[385:11.22]Now, Mr. Winters, I think it's time you left things in my house.
[385:18.56]The hell I will.
[385:20.36]I will take back my daughter!
[385:23.66]If I combine Rose with a Megamycet, my daughter will be manifested last!
[385:30.14]I've waited a century, a century, all for this day.
[385:38.65]Why do you exist in this place?
[385:44.53]I've never seen a human live without his heart.
[385:46.94]Are you sure of it?
[385:51.22]Ow!
[385:51.34]Die already!
[385:51.87]What happened?
[385:52.57]Did I step on something?
[386:26.45]Yeah, I'm saying the same thing.
[386:29.39]This is like a standstill.
[386:30.43]This sucks.
[386:33.11]I don't even have a knife.
[386:35.18]Freeloader gun!
[386:58.38]I'm killing myself.
[387:02.76]I did it with only the- whatever.
[387:05.32]I did it.
[387:27.69]Exact amount of ammo.
[387:29.01]I told you I had it That guy's don't drink a gallon of milk that's actually fucking terrible for you.
[387:39.85]I swear to God don't do that Like you can have two sips of milk.
[387:44.27]That's what we're gonna compromise here.
[387:46.06]Don't do that.
[387:46.80]I'm serious.
[387:47.28]That's actually really bad for you Didn't miss one shot with the Magnum
[387:58.76]It's alright, Rose.
[388:00.25]It's alright.
[388:01.51]That's why you save every fucking shot from the magnum and the grenade launcher to the final boss.
[388:10.99]Don't drink a gallon of anything.
[388:12.09]Yeah, don't drink a gallon of anything.
[388:21.98]Ethan!
[388:24.34]Ethan!
[388:26.49]Come on, Ethan.
[388:28.09]Come on, Ethan.
[388:28.87]Wake up.
[388:31.89]He's sitting there, like, putting slugs into the grenade launcher while he's like, she's about to kill you.
[388:37.43]He did it.
[388:38.41]It's finished.
[388:39.29]I think we've finished each other.
[388:43.87]Ethan, we gotta move.
[388:46.31]I thought she was dead.
[389:08.84]Keep moving, Ethan.
[389:10.00]There's a bomb in that thing that'll blow this whole village sky high.
[389:12.84]Hey, look at me.
[389:15.82]When I hit this trigger, we can't be anywhere near it.
[389:19.72]Ah, damn it.
[389:21.00]Mia's waiting for you.
[389:22.80]She's alive, you hear me?
[389:25.10]Alive.
[389:26.84]Mia... I'm so sorry.
[389:30.84]I love you.
[389:32.20]Keep Rose safe.
[389:33.20]Hey, hey.
[389:34.40]Hey.
[389:37.39]Wait, I'm part of Miranda.
[389:41.45]You tell yourself.
[389:43.53]Now come on, it's not that much further.
[389:50.46]Watch over her.
[389:52.78]Teach her to be strong.
[389:57.90]God damn it.
[390:05.83]If only we had another magnum round, right Chris?
[390:33.70]Alright, let's go.
[390:42.28]Time for you to say goodbye, giant evil plant baby fetus monster.
[390:55.01]Damn it.
[390:55.37]I didn't get to... I didn't take a picture.
[390:58.59]Tried.
[391:03.02]Rose?
[391:09.67]Go.
[391:10.79]Go, take us up now.
[391:11.75]I didn't have to all that, Chris.
[391:12.85]Just like drop the baby.
[391:14.08]Oh, fuck, no.
[391:17.66]Oh, fuck.
[391:19.62]Oh, my God.
[391:20.78]Is she alright?
[391:26.44]Get moving.
[391:27.44]We have to get clear.
[391:28.60]No, we can't go.
[391:30.08]Not without my husband.
[391:31.38]Mia, sit down and strap in.
[391:33.82]Not before you tell me where Ethan is.
[391:37.73]I know he wouldn't abandon us.
[391:39.28]The dude had antlers back there.
[391:40.58]What were those?
[391:41.08]Those things were crazy.
[391:41.88]What are those?
[391:42.22]Tell me what's going on.
[391:43.82]Where?
[391:56.11]What was that?
[391:57.25]I told you to sit down.
[392:02.33]Night vision?
[392:03.01]Oh, that's cool.
[392:06.49]Chris?
[392:08.61]What have you done?
[392:09.91]He's gone.
[392:11.05]I thought he just elbowed her in the face.
[392:12.73]I tried.
[392:13.97]Like backwards.
[392:16.09]He stayed so we could all escape.
[392:17.75]I was like, why does it make a metal sound?
[392:20.73]I'm sorry.
[392:23.99]Captain.
[392:26.27]You need to see this.
[392:30.62]BSAA didn't send soldiers.
[392:35.08]This is a bioweapon.
[392:36.80]What the hell were they thinking?
[392:41.94]Orders, Captain.
[392:43.68]Pick up the rest of the squad.
[392:45.98]Plot a course for BSAA Europe HQ.
[392:55.01]Someone's gotta pay.
[393:18.29]What about Duke?
[393:20.47]Maybe he'll narrate the ending credits.
[393:28.15]Did we ever find out what Duke is?
[393:30.77]After the credits.
[393:50.27]I'll get off cam for this.
[393:51.09]This is like a very cinematic experience.
[393:53.15]Don't eat that.
[394:10.32]Don't eat that.
[394:10.70]Don't eat that.
[394:11.10]Don't eat that.
[394:11.52]No.
[394:16.34]No.
[394:39.61]I showed this in the beginning.
[394:41.21]I still kind of don't get it.
[394:42.97]I do, but I don't.
[395:01.68]Why is she eating all these things?
[395:02.93]It's the buffet.
[395:31.14]Which one of these is Lady Dimitrisou?
[395:37.18]Gifts we gave, but more you took, she snarled.
[395:40.26]So more in turn is due.
[395:42.28]In a blink, the girl was trapped inside a mirror.
[395:46.14]Her parents, though, had searched all day and at last arrived.
[395:50.30]With rampant rage, father fought the witch, while mother's loving touch shattered the dark enchantment.
[395:57.47]But the witch was strong and father yelled, save our daughter.
[396:01.15]So mother bore their child to safety as the forest was consumed.
[396:06.24]It didn't happen.
[396:08.10]Even now, the burnt forest is a grim reminder of father's sacrifice.
[396:13.47]To this day, any child who stares too long into the charred wasteland will be haunted by nightmares of getting lost while picking berries.
[396:23.38]Is Chris the mother?
[396:27.12]No, Chris is not the mother.
[396:34.40]Alright, okay, let's turn it down.
[396:38.00]I'll give you my assessment I gave my assessment Okay, I'm gonna have to say That was that was a start of today's an 8.6 The ending brought it down to an 8.2
[396:58.33]Like that just like COD Zombies level brought it to like an 8.2 for me.
[397:02.93]I don't think that's cool.
[397:04.25]I never do.
[397:06.03]And then when I got to actually use my Magnum the way that I wanted to, I brought it up to an 8.4.
[397:13.20]And then this really cool cinematic in the end kept it at an 8.4.
[397:26.52]That was great.
[397:28.25]That was a great game.
[397:31.93]You stay at an 8.7.
[397:32.71]Or an 8.6 for me.
[397:36.95]If there's a FOV slider.
[397:40.05]Like, what the hell is that?
[397:42.92]It's fucking 2021.
[397:43.86]And it's a PC game releasing in 2021.
[397:47.56]I understand, like, no, but you'll ruin the cinematic experience.
[397:51.74]I don't care about that.
[397:53.62]You know what I mean?
[397:56.24]Like, if the zombie that's gonna be, like, three or four pixels forward or something, but I'm not gonna throw up playing the game, I don't, like, I don't, I, it's, I just wanna play the fucking game and not wanna throw up.
[398:10.81]It was an 8.7.
[398:11.21]It turned into an 8.4.
[398:22.42]They do that because they design the game around, oh, we don't want you to see shit you're not supposed to see, and it has the best experience, all the scares, all the jump scares.
[398:32.41]I know, but it was in the last fucking game.
[398:37.61]In Resident Evil 7, you could make 90 FOV in Resident Evil 7.
[398:41.55]What happened?
[398:42.29]What's the difference?
[398:44.27]It's the same, it's literally the sequel to the last game.
[398:47.73]Where?
[398:48.27]Where?
[398:49.09]Where?
[398:51.36]Anyways.
[398:57.83]No, it was really good.
[398:58.75]It was really, really fun.
[399:01.08]I like the kind of treasures that they put on the map.
[399:03.10]I thought that was huge.
[399:04.36]I thought that was a nice touch.
[399:07.58]It's cool.
[399:07.94]They're like, oh, wait, what's over there?
[399:09.48]I gotta go over there.
[399:10.00]I gotta get that treasure.
[399:11.56]I missed a bunch of shit.
[399:15.37]Was it scary?
[399:16.01]That was very scary.
[399:17.05]I think this was scarier than 7.
[399:18.21]I buy a lot.
[399:22.40]The first, like, two hours of 7 was really scary.
[399:25.74]Really kind of intense.
[399:27.88]But I thought this one was, like... The weird baby chapter freaked me the fuck out.
[399:32.78]It really did.
[399:34.98]I would say the first two to three hours of Resident Evil 7 was scarier than a majority of the shit in this game.
[399:41.87]But I kind of just liked how it played out in this one a little better.
[399:50.84]Resident Evil 7 was, like, actually, like, a more creepy, scary video game.
[399:55.76]Resident Evil 8 is, like... Just, like, jumpy.
[399:59.96]Very jumpy.
[400:03.18]And I guess, depending on how you decide what you like more as a scary game, I guess.
[400:09.09]This was more of, like, a fairy tale.
[400:10.59]Yeah, if I were to choose which game I liked more...
[400:16.15]I don't know, man.
[400:16.87]Like, Resident Evil 7's last, like, four or five hours, I just, it was a slog to me.
[400:23.19]That boat sequence in Resident Evil 7 was the ultimate slog and it brought the whole fucking game down.
[400:30.68]The whole game came down.
[400:36.80]I did not have... I was a little irritated in some points in the game, but no point in this game did I feel like that boat level where you're just like shooting machine guns into enemies.
[400:47.10]I mean, except for that Chris ending.
[400:50.98]I think as a whole, I think 8's a better game.
[400:53.30]I think 7, the first few hours, is scarier and more interesting.
[400:57.30]But I think 8's probably a better game.
[401:09.81]Yeah, Seven's definitely... Seven's setting was probably a little more interesting.
[401:13.61]I don't know, just something about, like, a weird, scary family chasing you around a house and shit.
[401:16.99]It's, like, weird and terrifying.
[401:19.36]But then they got rid of that, and then they moved on to, like, the boat shit.
[401:25.70]Bone in or boneless wings?
[401:27.28]Well, boneless.
[401:28.66]Because I like to just dunk them in sauce and just drain them.
[401:36.69]What about the Heisenberg parking garage segment?
[401:40.87]Yeah, but once I started to feel kind of annoyed and frustrated in that area, and how much of that is my, like, ADHD and ability to pay attention to, like, certain environments, I still don't think I was, I really just thought the boat sequence was just terrible, so.
[402:01.22]They're both really good games.
[402:02.10]They're both, like, great.
[402:08.78]Okay, let's see what happens here.
[402:10.08]Do we have an ending sequence?
[402:20.43]We do.
[402:35.20]Do you think the little boy will be able to touch the moon?
[402:38.26]Nobody can touch the moon.
[402:39.80]It's too far away.
[402:40.90]Wait, what if he has a rocket ship?
[402:43.82]Uh, okay.
[402:44.38]Then he can touch it, but it'd be very, very cold.
[402:49.80]He's going to Xavier's gifted school for mutants.
[403:22.47]Hey, Dad.
[403:25.40]Happy birthday.
[403:26.20]In my opinion, a grenade launcher is etched into this headstone.
[403:33.66]I have a lot of tests coming up.
[403:35.60]You know how it is.
[403:43.33]The goddamn devil.
[403:46.73]Duty calls.
[403:50.53]I love you.
[403:58.93]Yeah, I found her.
[404:01.36]Where else?
[404:02.70]The day of all days.
[404:05.80]We have a situation.
[404:07.48]You're needed, Evelyn.
[404:11.18]Don't you ever call me that again.
[404:13.04]It's just a joke, Rose.
[404:16.04]What kind of joke is that?
[404:17.98]Even Chris doesn't know I can do.
[404:22.92]It's like a horrific part of this person's life.
[404:25.66]Stand down.
[404:26.20]That's not a funny thing to joke about.
[404:29.78]She's just a kid.
[404:33.57]Way to keep it together, Rose.
[404:40.25]You're a lot like him, you know?
[404:47.68]I know.
[404:54.54]I just thought of... Like an ice cream video where the girl's like, I don't know why, I'm sorry.
[405:12.96]Who's in the road?
[405:18.77]The car is going to get stolen or something.

[409:40.41]What's going on?
[409:41.17]Why do they have health bars?
[409:51.85]Why is it playing iPad roll the marble music?
[409:57.61]You guys know what I'm talking about?

[411:55.91]Next area.
[411:56.41]I mean, I guess I'm going to go until I can't go anymore.
[411:57.97]How much money do I have?
[412:02.63]This is cool.
[412:03.67]Yeah, this is pretty cool.
[412:26.96]Oh god.
[412:36.28]Come on, somebody die!
[412:50.31]Come on!
[412:51.97]You're not gonna die, are you?

[414:07.60]Is this a slow Doom?
[414:08.88]Yeah, there'll be probably a million videos on YouTube of people beating this shit.
[414:19.29]With like 5,000 enemies killed, right?
[414:21.49]Just keep it going.
[414:22.43]Okay.
[414:40.76]You're throwing.
[414:41.34]I mean I'm...
[415:15.04]You're throwing.
[415:16.26]I don't even care.
[415:17.66]I'm just trying to play.
[415:19.94]There's one more guy with an arrow.
[415:24.02]What?
[415:26.44]Alright, goal.
[415:36.16]Where's the goal?
[415:40.34]Oh, fuck.
[415:41.34]How do I get up there?
[415:42.52]I don't remember this.
[415:47.07]There's a ladder, where's the ladder?
[416:19.23]I'll kill these guys.
