[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.67]Yeah, I know I said I'd be here at around noon, but I'm here now.
[00:09.63]I'm here.
[00:10.01]It's possible Jeremy's gonna quit streaming one day.
[00:18.38]What do you mean possible?
[00:20.66]It's absolute.
[00:24.34]You know, it's very possible that one day Jeremy's not gonna stream anymore.
[00:28.54]What do you mean?
[00:29.32]That's absolutely going to happen one day.
[00:33.76]I can't live forever.
[00:48.81]It's possible that one day he won't stream again.
[00:53.17]Possible.
[00:58.29]We found all the Horcruxes.
[00:59.83]Yeah, okay.
[01:01.09]You think so.
[01:04.10]You see that Voldemort what a dummy Why would you make it all those fucking objects?
[01:14.50]Why would you make it stuff like that?
[01:17.72]You you made it the most like popular things, you know, why would you do that?
[01:25.71]No if I had ten horcruxes I
[01:30.10]five of them are gonna be surgically attached to my body oh no one of them not five of them because then if you like shoot out of this stuff that it's gone I'm sewing one of my horcruxes into my bed why would you just put it in a vault no it's got to be with you around you at all times
[01:57.25]Why would you keep them on you?
[01:58.33]That defeats the purpose.
[01:59.25]No, because then you gotta come through me.
[02:02.97]I want one on me.
[02:04.05]I want one to be my baseball hat.
[02:10.78]You know what a great Horcrux would be, guys?
[02:12.68]Shit that you wouldn't even give a shit about.
[02:15.22]Why wouldn't he have made one of his Horcruxes his showerhead?
[02:18.74]Who the fuck is going to do that?
[02:20.56]Who would ever go into Voldemort's shower and say, this is definitely one of them?
[02:25.01]No?
[02:25.17]No?
[02:27.80]The handle, the little flapper of your toilet.
[02:30.96]I'm not going to make it some elaborate mystical device or being.
[02:41.07]No.
[02:41.19]It's going to be an old book that I didn't care about reading.
[02:51.87]Or a toilet seat.
[02:54.60]Or one mug.
[03:00.33]Anyways, hi.
[03:03.55]What was the joke?
[03:04.21]Oh yeah, people are just kind of coming in.
[03:05.75]They're just catching it halfway.
[03:07.49]Just go watch the beginning of the stream.
[03:08.97]It's only been like three minutes.
[03:10.07]You can catch up.
[03:19.30]What if it accidentally gets destroyed?
[03:23.08]Um, I don't think I'm going to be taking a shower and cast the Eviticus spell into the wall near the showerhead.
[03:35.29]Then what?
[03:36.01]Magical spells would be banned in my bathroom.
[03:41.90]It just wouldn't be allowed.
[03:44.92]Like, no, fuck that.
[03:45.64]You wouldn't be allowed to cast spells in my house.
[03:48.20]You know how people have the rule of take your shoes off before you enter the house?
[03:51.15]Put you wand over.
[03:52.17]No spells in this house.
[03:54.01]None.
[03:54.19]We're gonna do the Olympics today.
[03:58.47]2012 London Olympics.
[04:05.72]Not Mario and Sonic at the London Olympic Games.
[04:08.62]No, we're just doing... This apparently is the one that has the most games to play.
[04:13.22]I think it has 35 events.
[04:17.68]I also have the Beijing one, 2008.
[04:19.32]For some reason.
[04:22.24]I don't know why.
[04:26.66]I own it.
[04:28.45]It was not that expensive.
[04:29.69]Don't worry.
[04:34.03]This sucks.
[04:34.51]Just go play God Hand.
[04:35.59]I mean, that's an option if I don't like it.
[04:38.25]I don't think that's going to be possible, though.
[04:40.71]I saw a little bit of the preview of what this... I'm going to try to get gold medals.
[04:46.85]Silver medals, at least.
[04:53.79]You ready?
[04:55.07]I am.
[04:57.53]Here it is.
[05:01.65]I've had to hear this in my ears since the stream started, by the way, for six straight, seven straight minutes.
[05:08.06]This doesn't change.
[05:08.76]Alright, Olympic Games.
[05:14.08]Take on the world at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
[05:20.45]This is almost 10 years ago, yes.
[05:25.65]I'm gonna, I'm doing it.
[05:26.71]I'm gonna try to win as many as I can.
[05:30.61]How do streamers even read chat?
[05:32.69]Because we have... We don't.
[05:35.85]We don't.
[05:36.29]We just pick out one thing that somebody said every 10 minutes and hope that it's fucking relevant to the conversation.
[05:44.66]I'm just kidding.
[05:45.68]Facecam or Riot?
[05:46.54]See?
[05:46.84]No, I can read that one.
[05:47.80]Select how challenging the CPU will be.
[05:53.28]Well, we can't even do hard, so don't even tell me to select it.
[05:55.73]I can't do it.
[06:02.63]Hold on.
[06:04.10]Play 12 events.
[06:06.04]Play 20 events.
[06:07.02]Is this like Mario Party?
[06:10.50]Am I only selecting just the amount of turns we're going to have?
[06:12.78]How funny would that be if this just opened up on a game board with the dice and shit?
[06:18.73]Oh, a six.
[06:19.35]That'd be awesome.
[06:19.79]I kind of wish it was like that.
[06:30.98]It was kind of funny, I guess.
[06:32.87]That was just what it sounds like when you play Mario Party with the dice.
[06:36.01]That was a fact, not a joke.
[06:38.85]Alright, who am I playing as?
[06:39.65]Okay, we have Australia.
[06:47.27]Hmm.
[06:48.07]I have to be the United States, right?
[06:49.63]Like, I'm from the United States.
[06:51.21]Is this locked?
[06:53.49]What?
[06:57.34]Why is the United States locked?
[06:59.30]What's...
[07:02.68]No, it's definitely not luck.
[07:06.54]Oh, shit.
[07:07.38]Okay, I'm American.
[07:08.22]Do I get to pick who I am?
[07:09.18]Somebody made this joke, but I'm going to make it two.
[07:24.64]I had a plan to make this as well.
[07:26.12]I hope it's like an hour and 40 minute long cutscene.
[07:50.14]Alright, so do I have to be part of the opening ceremony?
[07:56.28]Somebody tell George not to spin the camera so much.
[07:58.86]I'm gonna fucking puke, mate.

[22:47.96]The song is playing over the other song.
[22:52.03]There are three songs playing.
[22:55.56]This is the Olympic Stadium in London's East End.
[22:58.64]Some terrific views over the city.
[23:00.36]But now it's time for the next event to take place.
[23:03.86]80,000 here and there are all watching.
[23:06.84]I don't know how to do this.
[23:08.68]Four of the eight go through to the final.
[23:10.98]Alright, Mr. Dan.
[23:14.24]Yeah, the four of the eight go through the final.
[23:16.27]By the way, this is the first time that Mr. Dan has ever stepped foot on track and field.
[23:20.25]The first time he's ever done a long jump.
[23:22.55]Welcome to the Olympics, mate.
[23:24.95]Okay.
[23:26.82]Don't s- Whoa!
[23:33.41]Press X to begin running.
[23:34.81]Tap X to fill the bar.
[23:38.39]Fill the bar above the white line without overflowing it.
[23:43.62]That's me touching it once.
[23:49.56]Speed lock.
[23:50.54]What the fuck?
[23:52.44]Click L as the athlete approaches the white line.
[23:59.72]Terrible.
[24:04.26]I get one practice run.
[24:06.97]Alright, let's go.
[24:09.01]I'm ready.
[24:09.43]Alright, Mr. Dan, let's go.
[24:11.11]Team USA.
[24:11.53]Ever.
[24:11.77]Okay, speed has been locked in.
[24:34.64]Looks like he snapped his ankle.
[24:38.04]He really twisted his ankle.
[24:39.96]I went so early.
[24:40.97]That's embarrassing.
[24:43.37]That's in front of 200 million people.
[24:49.43]Four?
[25:02.22]I could probably beat that right now.
[25:04.06]Yeah, I could probably do that right now.
[25:06.94]Last place by a huge amount, by the way.
[25:10.35]Not a little.
[25:12.79]Alright, come on.
[25:13.73]Redemption, Mr. Dan.
[25:16.11]Prove it?
[25:16.51]I could.
[25:20.21]That was super fast.
[25:20.93]Alright, here we go.
[25:32.79]What do you mean too low?
[25:39.97]Is it pressure sensitive?
[25:41.55]I think it is.
[25:42.37]I'm trying not to do it so hard.
[25:46.57]That was 5.4.
[25:46.85]That was okay.
[25:47.61]Come on.
[26:00.86]I think it's pressure sensitive.
[26:07.36]I got no idea.
[26:08.52]Okay, so hold on.
[26:09.22]That was pretty good.
[26:13.25]Did I step over the line?
[26:17.13]What?
[26:17.37]Next.
[26:30.33]God damn it.
[26:33.05]Alright.
[26:42.60]That was good.
[26:44.30]What's that one?
[26:45.12]Right on the line.
[26:45.74]You better not disqualify.
[26:47.18]You're gonna disqualify that bullshit?
[26:53.44]What?
[26:53.98]Somebody's gotta adjust that dude's glasses, okay?
[26:56.80]That was right on the line.
[26:58.48]I got disqualified.
[27:02.96]The world record's eight points.
[27:04.39]I still don't understand.
[27:05.77]So, okay, I pressed it.
[27:07.59]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, one, two, three, four, two, five, one, two, it's two.
[27:13.31]It's hard.
[27:14.11]Okay, here we go.
[27:19.77]That better not be a foul.
[27:20.77]That was before the... Foul.
[27:24.03]Well, that attempt's going to count for nothing, I'm afraid to say.
[27:26.67]It's a foul.
[27:30.56]How many times do I have to do this?
[27:31.96]I'm just embarrassing myself.
[27:34.45]That was so bad.
[27:37.29]It's hard to... Wow, that's awful.
[27:56.69]A new personal best is not even as good as like a 15 year old in high school.
[28:00.37]8th place.
[28:00.73]8.1?!
[28:00.75]Well this is a massive shock.
[28:02.03]One of the favourites has gone out.
[28:06.97]Team USA miss out on qualification.
[28:23.36]That was qualification.
[28:24.48]Alright, I got men's 200.
[28:25.60]Are you kidding me?
[28:26.44]I'm going to fucking destroy this.
[28:31.92]Sorry, Mr. Dan.
[28:32.80]Here comes the redemption, yeah.
[28:41.91]Because this one absolutely is going to be tap X as fast as you can, and I'm going to destroy all those.
[28:47.29]...of the Olympic Park.
[28:49.71]This is a terrific venue.
[28:52.23]Okay, what's the shove button?
[28:54.27]Oh, I was looking for the R. I was looking for who us.
[28:55.93]Okay, there's Doping Dan.
[28:57.13]Tutorial.
[28:57.71]Press X to launch.
[29:21.83]Tap repeatedly to fill the bar.
[29:23.35]Fill the bar above the white line without overflowing the speed.
[29:39.38]It's actually very hard to keep it here, I'll tell you.
[29:41.45]It's even running like that.
[29:48.23]Lunge.
[29:52.58]Okay.
[29:52.98]Keep barring the green.
[29:54.06]It's so hard to do that.
[29:55.34]You have no idea.
[29:57.52]It's so pressure sensitive and so fucked up.
[29:59.76]Alright.
[30:00.06]Let's do it.
[30:00.62]I'm ready.
[30:00.98]Top four.
[30:01.26]Doping Dan.
[30:01.70]Get in there.
[30:02.36]When do I go?
[30:03.60]Hold on.
[30:04.04]Oh!
[30:04.22]Oh!
[30:17.48]really needs to stop moving quicker midway around the bend and still the staggered start having an influence into the second half of the race come on trucks you you'll never beat me I'm gonna catch up to this little brick
[30:39.09]Home run goes through in second.
[30:41.69]And third, the USA.
[30:42.99]A top four finish is exactly what this athlete was looking for.
[30:45.65]Second place.
[30:46.83]Third place?
[30:47.49]What?
[30:47.67]They move on to the Olympic finals.
[30:51.31]A decent start in this one.
[30:53.01]And now, the replay just shows into the strain.
[30:57.12]That was so late.
[30:59.62]When it came down to the finish on the line, good strength to go through the take.
[31:04.50]Another good performance.
[31:08.64]He was gonna fall over.
[31:12.43]He was about to, oh shit.
[31:14.39]I just like, I just like breathed in like a fucking full dose.
[31:18.89]Oh.
[31:19.03]I'm gonna fall down.
[31:20.53]I'm gonna be easy.
[31:23.03]God damn it.
[31:28.35]Okay, this is it.
[31:29.08]This is the real one.
[31:36.45]This is for the Olympic gold medal.
[31:49.81]I got to get a gold with a doping Dan.
[31:51.92]Come on.
[31:59.06]Well, here we go then.
[32:00.20]Everybody's psyched up for this.
[32:02.26]Here we go.
[32:03.90]Okay, I'm ready.
[32:04.54]I'll be ready.
[32:43.96]That's the gold medal.
[32:51.47]I want to see that.
[32:52.25]See how small that bar got at the very end?
[33:02.08]That's the gold medal.
[33:02.78]That's one.
[33:03.18]Don't worry, I'll get a shitload more.
[33:11.06]Wait, do we have a medal ceremony?
[33:20.35]Is this a Wii game?
[33:20.87]No.
[33:20.93]Looks like one.
[33:21.25]Look at me, here I come.
[33:37.65]I think I lost.
[33:38.39]Holy shit.
[33:38.87]21-7-1.
[33:38.93]21-7-2. 0.1.
[34:01.30]I did it!
[34:02.00]Wait, that's not the whole thing.
[34:32.67]A condensed national anthem?
[34:37.59]Did it take a commercial break?
[34:39.13]Oh, say can you see?
[34:42.00]By the dawn's early light.
[34:43.44]Oh, we'll be back.
[34:44.32]I actually forgot the national anthem.
[34:47.78]I had to stop.
[34:48.80]I had to just get out of that.
[34:59.68]I forgot it.
[35:00.20]I had to get out.
[35:02.10]Alright, I got a gold medal!
[35:09.20]Yeah!
[35:11.82]Too bad, uh, Mr. Dan couldn't jump.
[35:23.74]I got a retry token?
[35:25.64]Oh, you get currency if you do well?
[35:29.95]I got three medal points.
[35:31.53]Ooh.
[35:32.35]Alright.
[35:32.73]Day one.
[35:36.59]Campaign summary.
[35:37.53]See the results of the events.
[35:40.79]But did not qualify.
[35:41.81]Okay.
[35:43.01]Medal tally.
[35:43.75]Let's take a look.
[35:44.29]Ah, yeah.
[35:47.69]United States.
[35:48.97]One gold medal.
[35:50.58]Poland's right underneath.
[35:54.90]Important link, is it?
[35:57.74]Find out.
[36:00.08]Yeah, that's pretty important.
[36:01.39]What's with that mouth?
[36:15.32]Why does it have such a scary mouth?
[36:29.68]Okay, we got women's archery, under breaststroke, trampoline, rapid fire pistol.
[36:36.37]Oh, how many can I do?
[36:37.43]Two, that's it?
[36:38.17]I need to do, alright, I want to do rapid fire pistol.
[36:43.76]And then I want to do archery too, though.
[36:46.62]Trampoline.
[36:51.70]I wish you could do more than two.
[36:52.84]Okay, men's trampoline.
[36:57.33]Here we go.
[37:07.29]Trampol- How do you do- How is- What are you doing on a trampoline?
[37:11.87]Lips and shit?
[37:14.03]Alright, let's do some backflip.
[37:17.71]Is this me?
[37:18.45]This is me, I gotta do well.
[37:20.42]Alright, select the routine.
[37:25.62]Select the tutorial routine and proceed to the next phase.
[37:27.50]When selecting routine, look at the difficulty and tariff before making a decision.
[37:31.08]What do you mean tariff?
[37:31.94]Are they taxes on my routine?
[37:35.85]The athlete will automatically build momentum.
[37:37.69]The routine moves are shown in the upper left area of the screen.
[37:41.75]Okay.
[37:42.11]So it's like circle, square.
[37:46.50]Press circle to start a tucked somersault.
[37:53.90]Press square to form a pike shape at the start of the second somersault.
[37:59.28]New button prompts appear when you must perform each element.
[38:04.31]down as the somersault completes to exit you only have 70 seconds to complete all eight skills any missed skills will award zero difficulty points and occur a heavy execution penalty time try to time your inputs okay here we go I'm gonna do like fucking five backflips
[38:33.60]Do people like shut up in the stands?
[38:35.26]Like golf?
[38:35.66]I feel like you would need that.
[38:36.54]They do, right?
[38:37.08]Beginner.
[38:37.40]Oh.
[38:37.54]Jerma.
[38:37.72]Jerma.
[38:37.86]Jerma.
[38:38.08]What?
[38:38.20]What?
[38:38.32]Expert 2.
[38:38.52]No.
[39:07.29]Well, they only get one chance on the trampoline and they've gone for a big routine now.
[39:12.39]This will be their chance to shine.
[39:32.78]Bouncing up and down just not good enough.
[39:34.76]It's the tricks that'll get in the points.
[39:37.38]I'm doing them.
[39:38.06]How do I do other skills?
[39:39.46]I know one move.
[39:40.92]How do I do other moves?
[39:41.82]Oh shit.
[39:42.00]There it is.
[39:42.66]Oh shit.
[40:02.13]That was a triple.
[40:02.91]I just did a triple.
[40:03.57]Come on!
[40:03.79]I'm doing it!
[40:36.69]Well, let's get a recap on that one now.
[40:38.45]Here's the replay.
[40:44.16]Oh, that was sick.
[40:45.40]These are incredible moves.
[40:46.90]Oh, I get it.
[40:50.72]I was doing the same move over and over again.
[40:53.18]This is the same one.
[41:15.24]Finally there's the other move.
[41:19.80]It's that same spin.
[41:29.32]okay alright alright what did I get six I'm intrigued to know what the judges think well that's all the action we have for you now from this event time now to hand back over to seth bennett that's your commentator allison kirbishley
[41:59.10]I looked over the chat.
[41:59.86]Somebody just said, fucking loser.
[42:07.29]How does this work?
[42:08.07]The artillery barracks?
[42:10.35]Do I have to throw grenades?
[42:12.07]Rapid fire pistol.
[42:30.01]What is this?
[42:35.08]That is a grenade.
[42:36.10]I'm holding a grenade.
[42:37.56]It's a grenade in my hand.
[42:39.72]Oh, no, it's not.
[42:41.16]Oh, dear.
[42:43.78]R2 to shoot.
[42:45.98]Oh, kind of good.
[42:57.22]Time limit per round reduces across the event.
[42:59.34]The final two rounds last for only four seconds.
[43:04.74]For the best results, aim the pistol in one continuous motion to shoot all the targets as quickly as possible.
[43:15.29]Let's go.
[43:15.91]I came right from the trampoline.
[43:25.87]Okay, here we go.
[43:26.91]You got to be quick.
[43:30.45]Can I just shoot the same target in five different places?
[43:33.03]Eight seconds.
[43:33.99]Here we go.
[43:36.89]Three, two, one.
[43:39.23]I got it.
[43:48.15]Okay.
[43:48.73]Alright.
[43:49.63]I got six out of there.
[43:50.75]I got a six.
[43:51.25]It's okay.
[43:52.31]Always good to get on the leaderboard in the first round.
[43:57.90]Round two.
[44:02.44]I only have four seconds to do this at the end.
[44:05.34]Okay.
[44:06.00]Six seconds.
[44:07.59]Okay.
[44:08.01]Okay.
[44:25.47]The results on the scoreboard aren't good.
[44:28.55]And some way behind the leaders.
[44:32.67]It's nerve wracking.
[44:33.76]Okay.
[44:35.86]I'll get it this time.
[44:38.82]Next up round three.
[44:40.42]Let's go.
[44:40.78]Six seconds.
[44:50.98]Okay.
[44:51.88]I brought it back.
[44:56.16]Let's go.
[44:56.94]I'll pull this back.
[44:57.84]Okay, do I have a red dot?
[44:59.91]Four seconds.
[45:00.65]Shit.
[45:00.95]Oh!
[45:01.75]That's hard as hell.
[45:28.41]I gotta get into fourth place.
[45:30.98]Fourth place is placing, right?
[45:34.18]No wait, this isn't Mario Kart.
[45:35.94]This is not like Bronze 2.
[45:39.10]I need to get third.
[45:39.76]Shit!
[46:01.03]I gotta pull the other four.
[46:01.91]Alright, let's go.
[46:04.38]One more round.
[46:05.12]I gotta nail this one.
[46:16.04]Get the fuck out of here.
[46:26.12]I'll take second place right now.
[46:27.32]Let's pull it back up to a silver medal.
[46:31.81]Fourth place?
[46:32.45]Oh, at least I Mario Kart placed.
[46:34.62]Damn it.
[46:35.68]I'm using a retry token.
[47:00.60]Let's go.
[47:00.94]Wait, that wasn't... Wait, what?
[47:01.84]Hold on a second.
[47:02.46]That was... Wait, hold on.
[47:03.48]That was just for the qualifying.
[47:05.34]That was not for the medal.
[47:06.32]I just retried a qualifier with a retry token.
[47:32.45]Oh.
[47:32.91]Well, he looked so upset.
[47:34.07]Did you see him?
[47:34.61]He was holding his head.
[47:35.41]He's like, I lost.
[47:36.51]I didn't do it.
[47:37.43]He'd be qualified.
[47:38.41]What?
[47:40.32]If you qualified, you'd be happy.
[47:42.32]Why would he be so upset on the screen?
[47:43.64]It's alright.
[47:47.32]It gives me practice.
[47:48.06]That'll keep him in the mix in the final round.
[47:56.08]Round three then.
[47:56.62]As before, six seconds to hit five targets.
[47:59.36]Pressure's on.
[48:05.03]I got it.
[48:06.53]I'm going to take second place in qualifying.
[48:10.84]This is good practice.
[48:11.90]I'm going to nail it now.
[48:18.56]I've got the rhythm.
[48:22.50]Things going well after that round.
[48:24.22]Let's have a look at the scoreboard.
[48:26.06]Second place.
[48:27.56]Here's round five then.
[48:28.88]Five targets, four seconds to hit them.
[48:35.32]Yeah.
[48:36.24]I'll take first place at the real, actual medal event.
[48:40.24]And he did.
[48:53.98]First place.
[48:56.22]Now he's happy.
[48:57.00]I needed to be happy.
[48:57.66]Why do they need a replay for this?
[48:58.64]Alright.
[48:59.28]Men's 20.
[48:59.54]It's rapid fire pistol.
[49:00.44]This is the one that counts.
[49:01.58]I have one return token.
[49:30.91]Welcome to the Royal Artillery Barracks.
[49:33.33]This venue is just about perfect.
[49:36.51]Alright, come on me.
[49:39.29]It's gotta be clean.
[49:41.97]Round one, let's do it.
[49:44.95]Eight seconds to hit the five targets.
[49:48.21]Plenty of time.
[49:48.97]It's alright.
[49:52.66]It's okay.
[49:53.28]It's alright.
[49:53.66]That's alright.
[49:54.12]That's a second.
[49:57.63]First shot was fucked up.
[49:58.23]Yeah, it was.
[49:58.76]That's alright.
[49:59.22]That's good.
[49:59.86]Good.
[50:00.00]Keep it locked in first place.
[50:23.02]He's in second place.
[50:23.68]94-94 tied.
[50:24.02]What happens if there's a tie?
[50:25.04]There was like a loud sound outside and it fucked me up.
[50:52.12]First place.
[50:54.90]Alright, I can lose it really quickly here.
[51:00.88]Don't get overconfident.
[51:03.69]This is the four seconds.
[51:11.27]Oh, what happened?
[51:13.69]What happened?
[51:14.37]Why did it fire twice?
[51:20.97]Oh my fucking god, why did it go pop pop?
[51:25.61]The pressure sensitive bullshit of the- Oh, come the fuck on.
[51:39.69]You gotta be kidding me, dude.
[51:41.46]Are you serious?
[51:42.28]I don't think I could even do that double tap again if I wanted to.
[51:49.70]I'm thinking about if somebody did that.
[51:52.92]They missed twice and they went like, oh my god.
[51:59.67]What happened?
[52:00.25]What did I win?
[52:00.73]I got a bronze medal.
[52:18.85]Retried?
[52:19.21]No, I can't.
[52:19.55]I need to save it.
[52:20.36]Have fun with your bronze medal.
[52:49.46]The bronze is fine.
[52:50.58]No, I'm not going to retry it.
[52:54.76]One bronze, one gold.
[53:25.85]Why is it so sad to look at that screen?
[53:27.51]Okay.
[53:33.67]I want to do the archery.
[53:34.61]I want to do archery.
[53:35.85]What's K-ring?
[53:39.30]Oh, this discus throw.
[53:40.74]I want to do K-ring.
[53:42.52]I don't know what that means.
[53:44.48]I don't want to do it.
[53:52.94]Wait, is this going to... Do we get gold medal Gwen here?
[53:57.60]There's plenty of crowd support here.
[53:59.64]They're all ready to get this event underway.
[54:01.32]The next event is the women's archery.
[54:06.72]Okay, here we go.
[54:07.24]This is archery.
[54:11.48]Come on, Gwen.
[54:14.58]Where's the bow?
[54:18.49]Is this going to run around and stab stuff?
[54:20.01]Archery was so important in the 14th century.
[54:22.81]It was compulsory.
[54:24.27]Oh, okay.
[54:26.02]Hold R to draw the bow.
[54:32.31]Use L to aim.
[54:33.51]Release R quickly to fire the arrow.
[54:39.25]Alright.
[54:40.91]Flight's affected by the wind.
[54:42.21]Be sure to compensate for wind strength.
[54:45.39]This drop.
[54:48.54]Okay.
[54:48.70]20 seconds before the shot's forfeited.
[54:50.10]You got it.
[54:54.21]Alright, come on, Kristen Reed.
[54:55.51]Kristen Reed's going for the gold.
[54:57.25]Two megabits per second up to the top left.
[54:59.08]Draw.
[54:59.20]In.
[54:59.36]Oh, shit.
[55:23.87]That's not a bullseye?
[55:37.86]Two miles per hour that way?
[55:39.66]That's... I didn't think two miles per hour was going to be that big of a deal.
[55:47.47]That's a qualifying.
[55:55.08]That's pretty sick.
[55:56.18]Yeah, I did great.
[55:59.48]It's meters per second.
[56:03.28]So that's actually like six, seven miles per hour.
[56:08.64]Why are we doing... I'm from the United States.
[56:11.06]How come they don't do... How come they don't convert every single thing for the one country on Earth that doesn't care to do the metric system?
[56:18.09]Why don't you do that for me?
[56:22.07]I expect you to do everything twice so I understand it.
[56:29.96]This is it.
[56:33.15]This is heavy wind.
[56:34.19]Thank you.
[56:38.53]Thank you.
[56:39.09]Thank you.
[57:01.24]This is actually fun.
[57:03.32]I like this.
[57:09.09]There's a flat Earth competition at the Olympics.
[57:13.89]I don't know what that means.
[57:16.63]Is that like just drink a bunch of beer and yell at each other?
[57:19.09]And argue about it?
[57:21.11]I don't know what that means.
[57:22.27]They have a competition.
[57:35.27]I think you're looking for debate.
[57:36.37]You compare the planets to see what one is the flattest.
[57:39.83]I need a bullseye right here.
[57:41.96]You got to do it quick.
[57:42.96]She really needs to lock in on the center here.
[58:04.58]Almost hit the other one.
[58:08.70]That's a qualification right there.
[58:15.03]Yeah, if I just play like that, I'll be fine.
[58:18.03]I was trying to hit the other target.
[58:33.15]It's only two hours to go?
[58:35.86]What do you mean two hours to go?
[58:39.54]That seems like a long time.
[58:43.12]Damn it.
[58:52.55]I can't get in that middle.
[58:53.53]It's magnetized.
[58:57.50]Two arrows.
[58:59.08]Oh.
[59:03.19]Two hours.
[59:03.67]I thought he said hours.
[59:06.97]Here it comes.
[59:08.83]Can I finally qualify for two events?
[59:10.65]Men's Pirates.
[59:12.47]Cycling.
[59:12.81]Oh boy, this is going to be interesting.
[59:41.49]Is Doug Dopamine here?
[59:42.51]What is his name?
[59:43.19]Dan Dope?
[59:43.53]What is his name?
[59:44.03]Dope?
[59:44.21]Doping?
[59:44.51]Doping?
[59:44.81]Yeah.
[59:45.03]How does this work?
[59:46.05]Oh, I can't go that way.
[59:47.17]Repeatedly tap.
[60:10.68]Oh yeah, you're gonna see.
[60:17.16]Hold down X to cruise.
[60:20.69]Oh, I see you use the stamina.
[60:23.79]Push and hold to move.
[60:34.34]How many people are on the track when we do this?
[60:40.03]Okay, I know how to steer.
[60:51.18]Sprinting uses stamina.
[60:52.58]Cruising regains stamina.
[60:53.88]Slipstream behind opponents to quickly regain stamina.
[60:59.18]Alright.
[60:59.80]Let's go.
[61:00.22]Why am I all the way at the end?
[61:10.44]Three laps to go in the men's Kirin then.
[61:12.81]And this steady build up.
[61:14.79]China looking good so far.
[61:16.67]They're leading the way.
[61:18.31]Bullying everybody.
[61:19.17]This is a good performance from Russia in second place.
[61:22.94]Have to be careful not to use all their stamina up straight away.
[61:27.78]You ain't fucking passing me.
[61:28.90]The power of the pedal for the metal.
[61:32.95]This is why it sucks to be code versus Koopa.
[61:35.15]He ain't getting by me.
[61:35.91]He ain't getting by me.
[61:36.81]Good luck.
[61:37.47]I thought he was putting his hand up to throw a punch.
[62:03.14]Isn't what I'm doing illegal?
[62:04.46]You can't do that.
[62:05.56]Alright, like I can get this.
[62:06.26]Alright, this is where it counts.
[62:08.06]It's called blocking.
[62:08.64]It's illegal.
[62:34.99]Can I get two golds back to back?
[62:36.26]They don't care.
[62:40.04]Alright, Kristen, let's go.
[62:42.14]I'm ready.
[62:43.10]Wait, what?
[62:44.64]I can pump the crowd up?
[62:45.76]She's acknowledging the crowd and they're very much responding.
[63:04.69]alright now I can't just whiff it having seen the first arrow what adjustments will this athlete make a good shot required to finish end one on a high
[63:33.77]Yep.
[63:34.51]Wait, that was the exact same spot.
[63:37.59]That was the same arrow.
[63:43.80]It replaced the other one.
[63:46.82]Holy shit.
[63:47.50]Okay, I gotta be better.
[63:49.08]25, 26.
[63:49.14]I gotta get that gold medal.
[63:50.12]I'm gonna pump the crowd up again.
[63:51.80]How do I do that?
[63:52.20]Square?
[63:52.40]Square?
[64:02.86]There it is.
[64:03.54]Ooh.
[64:03.66]No wind.
[64:33.81]Hold back the points from the seven.
[64:47.56]Not bad.
[64:47.92]Let's see if we get first place.
[64:50.22]Two more chances.
[64:53.45]I can overtake it.
[64:54.21]I know I can.
[64:56.09]And three.
[64:56.99]Arrow number one.
[65:05.01]That's a 10.
[65:10.59]That cream.
[65:11.31]That top note.
[65:19.42]Oh, yeah.
[65:21.08]Let's get 30.
[65:22.51]I'll fall into first place.
[65:24.23]I'll get that gold medal.
[65:25.21]I can smell it.
[65:31.65]Let's take a look at that replay.
[65:41.93]29.
[65:41.95]That's good.
[65:45.17]That's a good score.
[65:46.33]First place performance so far from Team USA.
[65:49.83]Three points ahead.
[65:50.71]United States of America.
[66:00.61]Do it again.
[66:01.09]Heavy wind here.
[66:12.84]That could have been... That wind changed on me right when I was about to let go.
[66:15.90]Did you see that?
[66:28.88]It was seven.
[66:29.62]Did it change to seven?
[66:34.12]Oh, man.
[66:34.78]That was a huge amount of fucking wind.
[66:37.43]Britain's going to fuck it up.
[66:46.19]No, they're going to have just as much trouble.
[66:47.71]I'm going to be in first place.
[66:49.03]First place.
[66:49.57]I told you.
[66:50.11]Gold medal.
[66:52.57]Those double tens back-to-back last round really saved it.
[66:59.05]Told you we were coming.
[67:01.23]Close.
[67:01.69]Close.
[67:02.09]Here we go.
[67:02.96]Here it comes.
[67:03.96]Nice work, Kristen.
[67:04.78]Second gold medal.
[67:05.56]Now you see.
[67:28.42]I wonder, my love, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
[67:50.85]I completely forgot about the happy birthday from the green screen day
[68:33.83]Can you get a -2 permanently?
[68:36.23]No.
[68:36.65]You can't do that.
[68:37.67]Alright, remember.
[68:38.29]The tactic here is bullying.
[68:39.25]The goal here is square in the circle peg hole thing.
[68:42.28]Just get it in there.
[68:43.48]Like a baby toy.
[68:44.52]Just get the square.
[68:45.34]It's not supposed to fit, but you're gonna get the square into the circle.
[69:03.67]This athlete's in the shape of their lives, and there's no reason why they can't go on to win a medal here.
[69:12.89]Just over 700 meters to go.
[69:15.57]The pacer leaves, and now it's down to the athletes to create their own speed, gradually winding things up as this event goes on.
[69:23.86]First place to Team USA at this stage.
[69:27.34]Russia going well.
[69:28.44]They're in second place.
[69:30.34]Rubbing shoulders hard here.
[69:32.40]Am I getting booed?
[69:35.10]You're going to hear the bell in a moment.
[69:39.84]The bell tolls.
[69:40.68]It's the final lap.
[69:43.77]In first place, USA.
[69:46.37]Just don't let him go by you.
[69:49.71]Wait, why is he taller?
[69:50.81]Why is he flying?
[69:51.61]Do you see he's flying?
[69:52.77]What a performance.
[69:55.93]What an athlete.
[70:00.00]It's a gold medal for Team USA.
[70:02.58]Did you see that?
[70:03.56]He like grew two times in size and was floating.
[70:06.35]It's another gold medal.
[70:28.68]He almost came in sideways.
[70:29.74]Here we go.
[70:30.66]Here it comes.
[70:31.90]Three golds, one bronze.
[70:51.99]Well, that concludes things for the day.
[70:53.79]No more events remaining in this session, so from Seth Bennett and all the team, we'll bid you a fond farewell.
[71:00.00]Skip, skip, skip.
[71:01.52]He skipped.
[71:04.06]No, that's just... That's abbreviated.
[71:08.18]Look, they abbreviated it already, so I'm just like... I pressed X. I didn't know I was going to skip it completely.
[71:17.24]I unlocked Spain's outfit.
[71:21.81]Cool, I guess.
[71:28.65]Alright, what's next?
[71:32.88]Two events.
[71:35.38]Press stroke, disc throw, and weightlifting.
[71:37.92]Yeah.
[71:42.47]We need to do disc throw.
[71:50.75]Is there wrestling?
[71:51.59]I don't know.
[71:51.99]There's a lot.
[71:54.49]There is... 45 different events.
[72:00.78]And I think some of those are 25 meter, 50 meter, 100 meter, right?
[72:04.96]There's supposed to be 40 events.
[72:07.58]Disc throw.
[72:11.07]I'm ready.
[72:13.52]Put it in 3D.
[72:14.70]I will.
[72:14.98]How does this work?
[72:19.63]Push and hold R. Don't release the stick.
[72:23.81]When the ring appears, push and hold R this way.
[72:26.93]Don't release R until all three... What?
[72:36.11]When the ring appears, push.
[72:37.71]Don't release... What the fuck are you trying to get me to do?
[72:41.49]Okay.
[72:42.05]Let's try that again.
[72:43.75]Push this way.
[72:44.39]Okay.
[72:46.50]When the ring appears, push the other way.
[72:53.44]Don't release it now.
[72:54.22]Okay.
[72:54.44]Push this way.
[72:56.38]Push this way.
[72:58.40]Push that way again.
[73:00.85]Push... When the ring appears, release R.
[73:08.87]the best throw flick when the yellow line is in the middle of the blue zone.
[73:16.60]Okay.
[73:24.36]Here we go.
[73:37.39]That's alright.
[73:37.81]That's pretty good power.
[73:38.95]And then... This is qualifying.
[73:43.13]I'll get it.
[73:43.61]Power lock.
[73:49.37]Lick it.
[74:09.09]I'm not going to qualify.
[74:10.55]I'm not going to qualify.
[74:12.97]I'm not going to qualify.
[74:14.38]That's good.
[74:16.06]Oh, angle, huh?
[74:37.57]I tried to do it up.
[74:41.09]I have to really clean this up right now.
[74:43.00]I'm going to do a high angle.
[74:54.04]That's what we call it's going out of the stadium.
[74:55.86]I just broke a record.
[75:00.98]That'll bring me back to fourth place.
[75:05.24]That put me in first place.
[75:15.38]That apparently was so good that I went from eighth to first.
[75:17.38]I can't laugh.
[75:17.88]Don't laugh.
[75:31.25]I think he's quite happy with that performance.
[75:36.71]Alright.
[75:36.97]I qualify.
[75:37.27]I qualify.
[75:37.63]Full power.
[76:02.66]new when I broke the olympic record in the qualifying round why can't I do that during the actual competition does it well look at the joy quite rightly the best performance this athlete has ever done here at the olympic games a new personal best
[76:34.88]Hey, but I gotta make it count.
[76:37.48]You could hit 500 home runs in the exhibition games, but in the playoffs, if you go 0 for 10, that's what people remember.
[76:45.98]It's true.
[76:52.98]Alright, here comes weightlifting.
[77:04.68]Over 155 kilograms.
[77:05.20]Here we go.
[77:05.66]Mike Frest.
[77:06.18]How does weightlifting work?
[77:07.32]Tap X. You must build power above the indicator.
[77:35.21]Hold L and R down simultaneously.
[77:38.23]Push L and R up simultaneously.
[77:39.87]Not pushing straight loses power.
[77:46.35]Alright.
[77:48.17]Tap X until the judges turn white.
[77:50.29]Turn white?
[77:51.29]What?
[77:56.78]Oh, the light.
[77:57.36]Right.
[77:57.52]Okay.
[78:07.13]You can only attempt three lifts, so make each one count.
[78:09.75]Try to lift as straight as possible for maximum power.
[78:14.37]The athlete will start to tremble when he's about to drop the bar.
[78:19.38]Okay, let's do it.
[78:20.22]Let's have a look who's going to be competing in qualifying in the weightlifting.
[78:26.38]It's the first round, and this athlete has to choose what weight they want to come in on.
[78:31.62]Wrecked the whole thing.
[78:34.00]Well, if he doesn't get this right, he'll be very disappointed.
[78:40.97]What?
[78:41.15]I was tapping X. What happened?
[78:42.30]Tap X, right?
[78:43.38]What?
[79:04.94]What?
[79:06.56]Do I have a timer of like two seconds?
[79:15.72]I want to lower the weight down.
[79:18.36]I don't... Okay, I'm trying to adjust the weight.
[79:20.56]It won't let me.
[79:28.58]Well, this is the final attempt for this athlete.
[79:32.63]You make it all the way to the Olympics.
[79:34.37]And you say, put on like 500 pounds, dude.
[79:38.67]Take it off an inch off the ground.
[79:41.01]Holy shit, that's so embarrassing.
[79:42.16]I want to, should I redo it?
[79:44.78]I couldn't even take any off.
[80:04.74]Retry token?
[80:06.06]No, no, no.
[80:08.63]It's alright.
[80:09.03]I got the disc throw.
[80:11.53]I was just tapping X. Why couldn't I...
[80:16.05]I wasn't doing anything else.
[80:16.89]It was like, tap X till you get to the power, and then you press down with both and up with both.
[80:21.63]I didn't even get a chance to press down.
[80:22.79]Welcome to this beautiful Olympic stadium, but specifically for these games, this really is the jewel of the game.
[80:31.14]Alright, here comes the guy with the world records.
[80:33.90]What a venue this is.
[80:34.82]Are you ready for this world record?
[80:37.06]Let's pump them up.
[80:39.18]This athlete needs a world record to win this event.
[80:44.63]The athlete will spin around as fast as possible before releasing the discus.
[80:49.36]All two kilograms of it.
[80:54.47]Get that out of here.
[80:55.21]That's a perfect throw.
[80:56.83]Full power.
[80:59.95]I just broke.
[81:00.47]I broke the world.
[81:01.09]That's a world record.
[81:02.11]I win.
[81:02.35]I don't have to do anything else.
[81:03.97]Game over.
[81:13.37]Can I just leave?
[81:14.05]Okay.
[81:15.29]Can we just stop the event?
[81:16.25]Just give me the gold medal.
[81:17.07]I can watch the rest of the event.
[81:20.37]Alright.
[81:24.33]Now I have to beat the world record that I just made.
[81:26.21]Okay.
[81:38.56]this guy's a maniac oh damn it that world record that's the end of the round and it's going to be really nobody can do anything to catch this athlete now I need 75.
[82:02.47]Can you imagine being in the Olympics?
[82:04.27]You train for 10 years to get here.
[82:06.55]And the first guy that gets up for the first heat breaks the world record.
[82:22.08]You want to talk about just completely demoralizing.
[82:24.54]The crowd appreciates it, but I think he knows he can throw further.
[82:36.81]I don't think I'll ever get past Stephanie46.
[82:48.03]Full power.
[82:53.19]Break the record.
[82:53.73]Oops!
[82:56.74]It's alright, still in play.
[83:05.44]Doesn't matter.
[83:05.92]I just, I'm not going to be able to do it.
[83:07.76]I might as well just throw it into the ground.
[83:09.56]Should I BM?
[83:11.22]I'm trying to let it go.
[83:11.74]I'm just trying to drop it.
[83:40.43]Alright, I'm going for it again.
[83:41.69]Oh, fuck off.
[83:42.84]Whatever, I got the record.
[83:46.90]Who cares?
[84:01.57]Well, let's see what they measure this one out, but that's a decent throw.
[84:14.38]We just did Olympic record.
[84:17.06]He's not even human.
[84:29.32]The approach, brilliant.
[84:30.94]The release point, great.
[84:33.44]And then it just came down to the distance.
[84:35.86]Fantastic.
[84:36.80]Holy shit, that cameraman really is messing up.
[84:39.24]That guy took pictures two or three seconds after it landed.
[84:42.68]It's horrible.
[84:43.10]A really strong performance from Poland.
[84:44.90]Second place, a silver medal.
[84:53.70]That's like 2,000 or 3,000 milliseconds lag.
[84:57.26]What a great ring that has to it.
[85:16.84]Next song?
[85:17.18]It plays if you win.
[85:18.40]Okay, we got four gold medals.
[85:19.18]I want to take a look at the standing medal tally.
[85:21.64]Let's see.
[85:22.26]I'm just killing.
[85:22.72]Four?
[85:23.54]Four golds?
[85:50.54]Javelin throw, you got it.
[85:52.30]Absolutely.
[85:56.62]Freestyle of swimming.
[86:00.53]Kayaking?
[86:03.51]Okay.
[86:04.39]Kayaking.
[86:04.89]Kayaking and javelin throw.
[86:10.43]Wait, do we get to use the record holder?
[86:14.86]I feel like if he can throw a disc that well, just give him a javelin.
[86:20.06]Teach him that too.
[86:21.37]Yeah, any object that you just have to throw hard really far.
[86:28.87]Just teach him everything.
[86:29.71]Oh, strong Dan.
[86:34.05]Okay.
[86:34.31]Oh boy.
[86:34.69]Have to begin running.
[86:35.73]Have to fill the bar.
[86:47.84]Pull.
[86:48.14]Push.
[86:54.38]Perfect angle is 35 degrees.
[86:58.99]I didn't have very much time to process that.
[87:00.89]You don't get that much time to do this.
[87:09.83]Starts the run now.
[87:18.43]What?
[87:22.61]Where's the foul line?
[87:23.81]What, because I stepped over it after throwing?
[87:25.83]There's no point measuring it.
[87:28.57]That throw won't count because it's a foul.
[87:35.29]Off he goes in round number two.
[87:41.36]Get out of here.
[87:41.88]Come on.
[87:45.60]Good performance there.
[87:49.44]68.
[87:49.52]I want to beat another world record.
[87:53.16]I can never reach that high again, and it sucks.
[87:56.56]I want to do it.
[88:00.01]Beat the Olympic record?
[88:01.79]Oh, just personal best.
[88:13.13]Well, the reactions of this athlete tells you everything.
[88:15.75]A new personal best.
[88:17.45]And quite rightly, they're delighted.
[88:18.83]The athlete from the United States of America.
[88:24.45]Should be no nerves now in round number four.
[88:26.59]I fucked it up.
[88:34.69]Well, I'm sure he'll feel he let himself down a little bit there.
[88:38.51]Sorry, I'm still, I'm in first place.
[88:40.23]And it just wasn't quite on it.
[88:45.45]I get it alright it's gonna get more speed okay if you had to stand out there and just stand with your arms to your sides and stand straight up and not move at all and this dude got three attempts to throw the javelin at you would you do that for 100 grand
[89:14.14]You think he would be that accurate to get you?
[89:18.59]I don't know.
[89:19.17]I feel like it would be hard to be that accurate.
[89:26.39]It's a lot of money.
[89:27.21]Yeah?
[89:36.60]Yo, you have to stand still.
[89:37.72]Yeah.
[89:42.03]There's like an operation-style device that's on your body that if you move, it goes... And then the 100 grand is removed.
[89:49.63]It's disqualified.
[89:50.45]It's all going to come down to this, the delivery.
[89:53.23]36 degrees.
[89:53.57]Really good throw.
[89:58.64]United States of America with a distance of 73.3...
[90:17.55]Don't throw so early.
[90:18.37]It's freaking me out because I stepped over the line once.
[90:20.54]I just gotta get one or two good ones.
[90:24.40]That'll be good.
[90:28.58]Alright, here comes kayaking.
[90:29.26]This one's gonna be interesting.
[90:40.13]If he gets too close, I'll just move.
[90:43.41]Yeah, you can just be like, alright, whatever.
[90:44.93]I'm going to take... This looks pretty cool.
[90:49.13]Wait, did more than one person do this event at the same time?
[90:57.20]Isn't that kind of dangerous?
[91:07.94]Why is this like a Mario Kart level?
[91:09.64]Is it like this?
[91:13.14]I didn't even do the tutorial.
[91:19.92]Oh yeah, I did.
[91:20.65]Okay, L is used to propel and turn.
[91:26.33]Hold while turning.
[91:28.53]Hold X to boost forward.
[91:32.79]Paddle downstream through the green and white poles to successfully complete.
[91:41.48]Hold R2 to paddle past the red and white poles.
[91:44.18]Upstream gates must be completed while moving back to the course.
[91:49.59]Hold R2 to plant the paddle and quickly turn right towards the gate.
[91:57.63]Turn and paddle upstream between the red and white poles.
[92:08.44]Struggling a little here.
[92:12.36]Lee the athlete.
[92:17.67]Ugh.
[92:24.01]There's eight people here.
[92:27.08]This is going to be a mess.
[92:33.28]Wait, am I cheating?
[92:34.70]What happened?
[92:35.14]Why do I have a 10 second head start?
[92:37.04]What?
[92:38.32]What?
[92:41.82]Hold on, am I gonna get a penalty for that?
[92:44.07]But it's just me.
[93:03.59]What are you talking about?
[93:05.39]Did I duck under it?
[93:07.34]I'm sorry, it doesn't matter what game it is.
[93:30.86]It's just all I think of is Kinect whenever I see a kayak.
[93:34.26]Or any water sport for that matter.
[93:35.96]It's just Kinect.
[93:36.72]It's just Microsoft Kinect presents minigame.
[93:39.18]That's all I think of.
[93:39.92]It's just minigame, Microsoft Kinect.
[93:41.20]That's it.
[93:43.51]And it sucks because this is a really difficult thing to do.
[93:45.63]This is really hard.
[93:46.43]This is like a really just grueling sport.
[93:51.21]And it has been dropped in my brain to funny Kinect games.
[93:54.55]That was a hard one to get through, but he managed it.
[93:58.19]He likes that.
[93:59.09]It's been a good performance.
[94:03.82]That's alright.
[94:04.38]I did alright.
[94:09.42]This does not look brilliant.
[94:16.42]This does not look like a guy that knows what he's doing.
[94:18.00]This looks like you just took a guy from the audience and put him in here.
[94:24.00]Oh, pretty good time for somebody that we just pulled from the subway.
[94:29.13]We gave him $50.
[94:29.53]We said, go for it.
[94:37.01]this athlete's happy no doubts about that that was a good performance well this is the final scoreboard holy that did really really well qualifying rounds well team USA this is the important one here am I is this olympic little league am I in competition with like 13 year olds four years of corporations
[95:10.66]Everybody literally sucks at kayaking.
[95:12.68]It doesn't matter how good you actually are, does it?
[95:15.10]I gotta get a good one.
[95:16.10]This is for the medal.
[95:17.06]Good speed.
[95:17.94]Good angle.
[95:18.46]And that's a snapshot moment.
[95:40.01]right underneath the Olympic record.
[95:47.57]Damn.
[95:47.93]A little too early.
[95:49.71]Why is that so slow?
[95:50.53]This looks very good.
[96:12.37]That's going to be a foul.
[96:13.73]Needs to stop before the line.
[96:16.90]Why did I fall down?
[96:18.72]A wonderful performance so far, and the results on the scoreboard are just as electrifying.
[96:24.80]It is a terrific, terrific lead that this athlete takes from here.
[96:31.97]Third round of the javelin now.
[96:36.41]I fell down.
[96:37.28]Is it a foul if you fall?
[96:39.57]But he just looks stupid.
[96:40.45]Throw it straight.
[96:41.01]I'm trying.
[96:41.35]Oh, this is bad.
[96:41.87]Just throw it.
[96:42.37]Whatever.
[96:42.59]That was a horrible one, but...
[97:07.44]We have 50 community subs from Suck McJones.
[97:15.90]Thanks for the 50 subs.
[97:18.77]That's insane.
[97:19.69]That's 50 community subs.
[97:23.89]This one's for you.
[97:24.89]You ready?
[97:26.09]This one's for the 50 subs.
[97:27.55]I'm going to break the fucking world record right here.
[97:29.35]Next one.
[97:35.74]We only need one to win.
[97:37.04]Okay, this is it.
[97:38.44]I'm going to break at least their Olympic record later.
[97:42.94]Nope.
[97:43.06]Wasn't going fast enough.
[97:44.18]Shit.
[97:44.50]Sorry.
[98:01.36]That one lands, but how long is it?
[98:04.02]It's a 50 substrate.
[98:06.14]That's so much.
[98:08.76]That's still gold medal.
[98:09.76]I still win.
[98:11.03]A new Olympic champion.
[98:14.95]Here is the replay.
[98:17.15]Let's take a look at that big one again.
[98:21.81]Yeah.
[98:22.67]Right below the Olympic record.
[98:26.23]That line right there, damn it.
[98:27.39]Nice work, strong Dan.
[98:28.65]Nice work.
[98:29.25]I just, I didn't mean to skip it.
[98:30.83]I pressed X way too early and I skipped it accidentally.
[98:57.38]Time for the gold medal in kayaking.
[98:58.58]Don't worry, we're going to hear it right here because I'm going to get the goddamn gold medal.
[99:09.27]Alright, come on, Kevin.
[99:14.96]Come on, Kevin, let's go.
[99:15.72]Come on.
[99:21.41]Trying to use the most direct route and leaning very hard to make that happen.
[99:25.67]Can't allow the boat's momentum to stop through this upstream gate.
[99:33.96]Well, that shows the control of the kayak, the way this athlete's leaning.
[99:38.70]Leaning very hard to one side here.
[99:41.39]Moving nicely through the first time check.
[99:44.81]Well, the next gate is against the current.
[99:46.77]It's upstream.
[99:55.99]Well made hard work of that gate.
[100:01.07]Completely and utterly missed that gate.
[100:03.91]Alright, we're good.
[100:05.59]Through two sections.
[100:07.63]Cleaned through that last gate.
[100:09.60]Well, this is all about timing through the oval.
[100:12.30]Come on!
[100:16.02]Needs to keep on top of the white water through the sub stream gate.
[100:21.90]Did well to get through that gate.
[100:30.66]Well, there will be some disappointment because this athlete has picked up a few penalties here.
[100:35.03]Maybe this athlete can take some consolation out of a good final section.
[100:40.71]Needs to improve on the performance so far.
[100:43.73]This is the last big drop of the course.
[100:45.84]It's a big bet.
[100:47.34]Well, it took an awful lot of hard work and effort, but eventually got through that.
[100:50.86]Yeah, that's a finish!
[100:54.16]That's gotta be decent.
[100:55.34]91-99.
[101:03.63]Not at all.
[101:04.21]Not even close.
[101:04.81]This is good.
[101:06.27]What's bad?
[101:34.13]The smoothness is just absolutely smooth.
[101:36.49]A bronze medal.
[101:48.64]A bronze medal.
[101:58.45]What was the score?
[102:03.08]What was the score?
[102:03.70]I didn't see.
[102:05.26]What was the score?
[102:09.71]What was the score?
[102:13.71]I want to see the score.
[102:14.53]I want to see the actual score.
[102:15.57]God damn it.
[102:15.85]I wanted to see how much time he had against me.
[102:41.67]Let's take a look here.
[102:42.59]We got United States China's got two gold medals now Two bronze medals bronze are gonna mat up in the end 100 women's ski And I'm gonna do the breaststroke
[103:12.05]This is definitely just tap as fast as possible.
[103:14.69]No way it's not.
[103:15.37]That's all you need to know.
[103:33.25]I don't know why I was like looking at the other monitor over here for a second.
[103:35.57]I thought they were all naked, like actual, just completely butt naked.
[103:38.41]I was like, what the hell?
[103:40.07]And then on the right, yeah, they're with a little underwear.
[103:49.77]How does this work?
[103:51.28]Go.
[103:52.24]Die.
[103:54.84]Tap X repeatedly while underwater.
[103:59.81]Hold down to swim.
[104:22.92]Where?
[104:23.36]Press the correct button.
[104:29.26]For a final boost, press X at the end of the race to lunge for the wall.
[104:33.70]Climb each stroke to when both arms are fully extended to build the most speed.
[104:40.82]Alright.
[104:41.84]Go Lance.
[104:49.31]Press X. No.
[104:52.41]What if you lunge hard and slam into the wall?
[104:54.96]What?
[104:57.04]Oh.
[104:57.90]Approaching 25 meters and already some early moves into their stroke pattern at 25 meters.
[105:12.62]Some way off the pace here.
[105:18.72]I hope as soon as the L and R appear.
[105:24.18]The kick's weak.
[105:26.02]It's Germany who lead the way.
[105:27.16]France in second and Sweden fourth.
[105:30.96]Now into the final 25 metres.
[105:32.82]Who's going to come out on top?
[105:43.06]It's Sweden who qualify in first place.
[105:47.75]Oh, did I make it to fourth?
[105:53.90]What the fuck happened?
[105:55.74]This just reminds me of those old shows where, you know, we talk about the, you get the hot dog eating contest, the guy with the bear.
[106:08.92]This is like the man versus the otter.
[106:13.46]And we make sure we give the otter.
[106:16.89]Five seconds before, I got five second head start on the otter.
[106:20.80]I was the otter.
[106:21.54]Bears shouldn't eat hot dogs.
[106:23.10]No, they really shouldn't.
[106:24.18]Tell that to like late 90s television.
[106:42.70]They sure thought it was real funny.
[106:44.30]I'm going to do this well.
[106:45.72]Oh, shit.
[106:46.34]I'm going to do so well here.
[107:06.67]The reticule will shrink when the target can be hit.
[107:09.05]Track the target's move before shooting for the best result.
[107:11.15]Always shoot the yellow target first.
[107:16.17]Okay.
[107:18.05]There will be plenty of competition.
[107:22.44]These athletes equally match.
[107:24.28]Not much between them.
[107:25.38]Well, here we are on station one.
[107:30.64]First up, the single.
[107:33.06]Pull!
[107:36.67]Yep.
[107:37.51]Almost blew that one.
[107:38.53]Here comes a double.
[107:39.93]Whatever.
[107:40.21]Come on.
[107:40.53]I got to do this well.
[107:41.07]Only one?
[107:43.55]Fuck.
[108:07.28]That's tricky.
[108:07.66]Just a single right?
[108:32.95]What happened?
[108:33.53]Got to be right on that.
[108:36.83]She didn't react fast enough to that first target.
[108:39.13]I think it's the R2 is messed up.
[108:40.80]I really mean that.
[108:47.46]Two more to Metallic.
[108:51.84]Well, that's a good round.
[108:53.06]And there's no doubt now that this competitor can have the confidence that they can keep up with the leaders here.
[109:00.85]I feel like that's a weird way to hold a gun.
[109:02.83]It's like let it rest on your shoulder.
[109:05.03]Ah.
[109:05.95]Open like that?
[109:11.83]Really heavy.
[109:12.45]That's how you hold a rifle?
[109:13.57]You have it like open like that over your shoulder?
[109:17.49]I've never seen it.
[109:32.93]Yeah, I can't say I've ever held a rifle before in my life.
[109:38.13]And what the hell would I know?
[109:42.72]This is the double.
[109:43.62]Picks them both off.
[109:51.24]That's a brace.
[109:55.10]I think I got the hang of it.
[109:56.70]Every single station.
[109:58.62]Heavy scoring.
[110:04.88]Just got to wait, stay in the middle and see where it goes.
[110:11.34]Two more targets still to hit.
[110:15.91]Came out fast.
[110:16.85]Very fast.
[110:18.41]Well, that's the end of the round.
[110:21.87]He's saying hug.
[110:22.51]Hug.
[110:22.75]There's another one.
[110:38.81]It's close.
[110:39.89]I'll give it to you.
[110:44.95]If you close your eyes, block your ears, and yell really loud, I guess it's pretty close.
[111:15.03]The person in last place only hit one target.
[111:20.96]Did they?
[111:22.34]Yeah, they did.
[111:29.72]What's the excuse there, do you think?
[111:34.36]I think the next day you fake an illness, right?
[111:36.32]The next day after the Olympics you go, like, turns out, yeah, I had, like, fucking wicked bad diarrhea.
[111:42.61]yeah I was like I had like I was like wicked sick with diarrhea and like this that's that's what I would do like I tried my best right I mean I was feeling terrible
[112:12.49]If you say wicked again, I will sub for real.
[112:15.41]That would be wicked cool if you did.
[112:16.45]Nope.
[112:17.51]Blew it.
[112:18.33]Still good.
[112:19.03]Alright, now let's make it really happen.
[112:40.12]If you have a solution to any social issue, you're just saying he has diarrhea.
[112:43.08]Because that's an incredibly easy to understand thing.
[112:46.84]There's no nuance there.
[112:48.16]It's just, I have diarrhea.
[112:53.08]You don't have to explain that.
[112:54.23]You don't have to tell anybody anything.
[112:55.63]There's no beginning, there's no middle, there's no end.
[112:57.79]There's only diarrhea.
[113:00.87]Everybody understands it.
[113:04.43]And it's a thing that nobody wants to question either.
[113:06.41]Although, be careful using it that often.
[113:15.98]Oh, I thought I missed it.
[113:16.96]That's good.
[113:21.94]I like it.
[113:50.21]or if you hit one you know I mean if back in the day when there wasn't really any cameras here I would just say I tried to do it with my eyes closed oh alright damn holy shit yeah I tried I got one that's impressive now for the double
[114:15.23]Put him on the screen.
[114:16.23]Fantastic.
[114:17.19]Technique.
[114:19.11]Absolutely perfect.
[114:20.60]Three hits.
[114:23.06]Team USA then putting the pressure on at the top of the scoreboard.
[114:26.90]But there are two or three others that are very close by.
[114:29.64]Yeah, this is Anna.
[114:33.94]Anna's really close.
[114:35.18]Paul.
[114:44.11]Oh, I dropped it.
[114:45.27]I dropped it.
[114:46.37]Alright, we're good.
[114:47.95]You can miss one, it's okay.
[114:51.27]3-3-3.
[114:51.89]She's been perfect.
[114:55.47]Alright, I gotta be perfect here.
[114:57.56]I want that gold medal.
[115:19.13]Mega low losing.
[115:21.05]Mega low losing.
[115:22.01]You're losing to Norway.
[115:25.47]I'm going to delete those channel points.
[115:28.63]If you keep fusing them.
[115:50.08]Don't, don't do it.
[115:58.69]Have you guys even seen the new emotes yet?
[116:02.33]Can we see the new emotes please?
[116:04.59]I want to do the diving competition.
[116:19.54]Like I would be really good at that one.
[116:20.88]That was good.
[116:21.74]That was clean.
[116:24.82]I ran away with it here.
[116:25.68]17 to 13.
[116:27.78]I can relax.
[116:29.68]Yeah, it's alright.
[116:31.10]I can miss.
[116:46.83]Jerm of punching why are you doing the punching this looks like a lot of fun but is it weird that I don't want a rifle I want a plate shooter
[117:13.33]I want to shoot the clay plates with clay plates.
[117:20.81]Like tribes, yeah.
[117:29.91]I want a tribes clay disc shooter gun.
[117:33.32]Try to hit the other... That'd be awesome.
[117:36.16]That'd be so hard.
[117:37.28]This is a shotgun.
[117:38.42]Yeah, but I don't... I want a plate gun.
[117:53.30]somebody that knows explain it to me I thought shotguns were really low range there are two targets here on offer that can be hit will it be enough though to win a medal this is station number eight well no mistakes here it's just big spread don't they just the pellets all spread out like all over the place I guess that's kind of the point
[118:15.69]That's just video game logic.
[118:19.25]Really?
[118:20.67]I thought that you shot, like, this, like, bird shot.
[118:28.30]Buckshot.
[118:29.12]Slug, right?
[118:31.28]It blows up out of the gun and it just goes... Oh, that's called bird shot because they shoot birds in the air?
[118:39.22]How can I live in America and not know anything about guns?
[118:49.18]I don't know.
[118:49.80]I don't like to use them.
[118:59.08]Just because you're in America doesn't mean that... I have like four shotguns.
[119:01.76]I got six golds.
[119:02.48]I've kicked a gun before.
[119:20.83]That seems like a bad idea.
[119:22.85]I'm not sure that's smart.
[119:28.21]We got high jump.
[119:32.04]Table tennis?
[119:32.90]Oh yeah.
[119:34.06]This is gonna be great.
[119:35.26]I can't wait.
[119:36.84]And then we do high jump.
[119:46.22]How does high jump work?
[119:47.18]You just jump as high as you can and somebody measures it?
[119:50.64]I don't think I've ever seen this.
[119:52.66]Wait, is this thing where they jump, they arch their back, and they, like, slime their legs around the bar?
[119:57.44]This thing's insane, if this is what I think it is.
[120:01.97]Yep, this is it.
[120:05.15]Fill the bar.
[120:11.87]These ones are so hard to do.
[120:14.01]Flick when the athlete reaches the white marker.
[120:18.27]Press X to kick your legs and avoid the bar.
[120:24.58]60 degrees is perfect jump.
[120:27.20]Drive.
[120:34.12]Having to get the bar.
[120:35.02]Use L and R to adjust the bar height.
[120:36.08]Nobody can jump over that.
[120:36.88]Nobody can jump over this.
[120:37.96]This is like 15 feet high.
[120:38.84]How big is this?
[120:56.79]Here she is, ready for a world record.
[121:09.47]The aim is to go over, not under the bar.
[121:14.30]The replay doesn't lie.
[121:15.72]She must be delighted with that.
[121:20.72]Attempt number two.
[121:22.42]This is a world record.
[121:24.32]Who the fuck was able to do that?
[121:35.75]Diving under the bar only gets you onto the outtakes of this Olympic Games.
[121:42.95]Here's the replay.
[121:45.03]Well, here we go.
[121:45.57]Attempt number three.
[121:46.37]Looking for better things.
[121:48.11]I can't lower it.
[121:58.86]What the fuck?
[122:00.32]Diving under the bar gets you nothing other than a round of applause from some.
[122:07.97]Huge disappointment for Team USA.
[122:13.26]This is the Olympic Stadium.
[122:14.58]Welcome.
[122:15.14]One of the most sustainable ever built.
[122:17.58]The lower bowl is set into the existing landscape.
[122:21.16]Well, wait, the world record is 209.
[122:24.98]Why did I think I could jump over 2.6 if the world record is 209?
[122:36.60]Why are you even allowed to put it this high?
[122:46.87]You gotta be kidding me.
[122:48.11]Alright, I'm coming down... to... 170... 180.
[122:57.97]This is gonna be relatively testing, but there's no doubt this athlete should go clear.
[123:08.21]There it is.
[123:09.47]That was close.
[123:09.97]I could have gone a little higher.
[123:11.25]190.
[123:11.29]Let's go.
[123:13.43]This is the poker event in the Olympics.
[123:18.33]Let's go.
[123:38.74]Ooh, I got it.
[123:39.44]I'm going for 210.
[123:49.07]I'm going for 210.
[123:51.45]Great stuff so far.
[123:52.53]Let's take a check on the scoreboard.
[123:55.23]First place, a stunning start to this competition.
[123:58.64]Really laying down the benchmark for everyone else to follow.
[124:08.15]Oh, shit!
[124:09.73]That's a foul.
[124:16.09]The replay doesn't lie.
[124:17.50]She must be delighted with that.
[124:19.70]What happened?
[124:20.04]I didn't even see a replay.
[124:28.85]Contact with the bar and it will fall.
[124:42.00]Why can I not lower it?
[124:54.36]It's a fucking world record!
[125:05.09]Oh shit!
[125:08.26]They're not going to give me any fanfare for that?
[125:10.52]I just did the world record.
[125:11.62]I can't lower it.
[125:12.34]Wait, once I beat the world record, everyone's like, no, no, no, no, you got to go higher.
[125:20.13]No one's going to be able to do this.
[125:31.62]This athlete is looking to jump higher than anybody else has in the history of this sport until five minutes ago.
[125:39.44]It's the bar and it falls off.
[125:49.77]He's a good take.
[125:50.51]We've got to go higher than that.
[125:51.71]Come on, man.
[126:01.26]You head up the side of the bar.
[126:27.34]Again, this is world record in the qualifiers, right?
[126:32.67]I didn't win anything.
[126:34.17]As long as I continuously clear two, I'm going to start 1-8.
[126:40.87]Table tennis time.
[126:58.72]I'm intrigued by this one.
[126:59.76]I love ping pong.
[127:00.64]I love it.
[127:04.68]I'm terrible at it.
[127:06.46]I consider going back and forth three times a victory.
[127:21.27]Before somebody goes, oh, too hard, goes into the ceiling.
[127:23.37]Whoops, just get it again, man.
[127:24.70]We'll do it again.
[127:26.16]Going one, two, three.
[127:27.44]Oh, that was fun.
[127:27.94]I don't know how people do it that hard.
[127:30.04]I don't know.
[127:30.66]Star does this shit.
[127:32.46]Just like the... I can't even see that fast.
[127:38.16]I can't even see that fast.
[127:39.30]It's impossible.
[127:42.60]Push it for a straight topspin.
[127:48.88]Aim to the left so it's just timing.
[127:52.67]Aim to the right.
[127:54.71]It's for backspin.
[128:00.81]Oh, you can move.
[128:06.99]Press R and quickly rotate towards R to add right spin.
[128:16.66]Okay.
[128:16.78]You need to reach seven points with a two-point leap.
[128:25.11]up next the USA USA versus France Peter ko oh Peter ko okay well the next event's ready to go and in the commentary box for us I made this name for a second thank you for that seth well excel London is packed to the rafters and it's a great reception here for our two competitors
[128:55.04]Slows the rally down with a side spin.
[128:58.16]Keeps them all alive with a backhand.
[129:01.76]Oh, what happened?
[129:02.70]Simply just not good enough there.
[129:04.90]And he's going to lose the point on that one.
[129:09.62]Try to save it.
[129:10.48]0-1.
[129:12.88]Come on.
[129:18.79]Oh, that mistake could cost him.
[129:19.95]This is awkward.
[129:20.89]It could cost him big.
[129:22.05]To serve.
[129:22.49]2-0.
[129:30.68]I get it?
[129:31.22]They hit the corner of the table.
[129:34.14]They hit the corner of the table.
[129:36.16]I got the corner.
[129:36.66]This is the Resident Evil tank controls.
[129:49.61]They like killing me.
[130:04.99]It's right across the table with a forehand.
[130:13.47]Just don't get yourself into trouble.
[130:15.59]You've got to win by two.
[130:16.37]Remember, that's important to remember.
[130:20.68]Well, it's another point lost for him, and he really does need to get back into this.
[130:24.58]5-1.
[130:34.06]So the rally's starting to take shape.
[130:35.98]Fantastic rally kept alive with the backhand.
[130:37.83]Why are we both treating this like it's a bug flying around the room?
[130:41.03]Get it away from me.
[130:41.69]Keep to the point with that forehand.
[130:43.13]Shit, it's by my face.
[130:43.93]Great technique on show with the backhand.
[130:59.68]5, 2, 1.
[130:59.74]Yeah, we're paying attention.
[131:00.44]Got him.
[131:00.90]Now what can they do from here?
[131:05.44]Does anybody else feel like the table should be raised like a full foot?
[131:09.58]We're really hunching down here.
[131:21.73]Struck that beautifully on the backhand side.
[131:25.11]Just places the ball with the backhand.
[131:28.39]Oh, did you see that curve?
[131:30.81]Wait, how did I get that correct?
[131:32.77]Oh, yes.
[131:32.97]Oh, fuck.
[131:54.61]Ooh, did he get it on the edge?
[131:55.78]You motherfucker.
[131:58.02]No, he did not.
[132:04.82]Can he take advantage of game point now with this serve?
[132:08.67]Nope, he cannot.
[132:09.37]He gotta win by two points.
[132:10.49]Oh shit, the camera thing.
[132:11.65]Fuck, I'm sorry.
[132:25.63]So the rally really starting to take shape.
[132:28.93]What?
[132:43.96]He really needs to focus now.
[132:45.70]Here we go with the first serve of the second game.
[132:50.28]This is what I'm talking about.
[132:51.78]Look at how high the guy on the right's chair is.
[132:54.47]Why don't they just put a couple of books underneath the table to make it be like four or five inches higher?
[132:59.17]We're all like leaning down here.
[133:00.67]Why does it have to be this low?
[133:13.31]Backhand across the net.
[133:14.47]Went for power with a smash.
[133:20.85]What the fuck?
[133:21.53]That was not even good.
[133:22.72]I can't even... Yeah, I know.
[133:23.82]I said it first.
[133:24.74]That means I can say it.
[133:25.44]It's fine.
[133:25.68]I can say it first.
[133:26.24]Why am I acting like this?
[133:47.11]Look at the way that I'm volleying this back and forth.
[133:53.25]I don't get it.
[133:54.83]I'm trying.
[133:58.09]It's too weird.
[133:58.97]It's too weird.
[133:59.67]It's fucking weird.
[134:00.55]It's weird, alright?
[134:01.65]It's weird.
[134:02.15]Yeah, let me explain this.
[134:08.10]Okay, imagine this is a GTA 5 minigame that you can pull up to.
[134:13.08]Right?
[134:13.34]That's how this feels like to play.
[134:14.64]It feels like this is a GTA 5 game.
[134:17.47]Let's put golf in.
[134:18.37]Let's put, like, this in.
[134:19.55]Yeah.
[134:19.91]That's what it feels like.
[134:20.84]Yep.
[134:21.16]Yep.
[134:21.40]Yep.
[134:22.88]Take all blame away from me.
[134:23.72]Got it.
[134:28.64]This is where we come back.
[134:50.05]What a shame.
[134:50.79]He's trailing here.
[134:52.33]And the difference between the two players is getting bigger.
[134:55.29]How did he miss that?
[135:01.51]Why are you just like swatting at it?
[135:07.31]Why?
[135:07.59]That was so just violent and just incorrect.
[135:10.70]The serve is crucial.
[135:13.50]Piling the pressure on.
[135:14.52]They take the point.
[135:15.74]Where can they go from here?
[135:19.35]Match point now.
[135:20.37]Can they get that place in the final?
[135:21.59]Move back?
[135:22.13]United States of America to serve.
[135:23.93]What a good, solid performance from here today.
[135:28.76]He wins it for France.
[135:31.26]Two games to nil.
[135:37.68]Well, that's all the Olympic action from here for the moment.
[135:40.69]Seth Bennett will now wrap up the results.
[135:44.29]You only get so many world records in a day, okay?
[135:56.40]Okay.
[135:59.25]I currently have the world record.
[136:04.27]My world is 210.
[136:06.39]Why does nobody care that the record is 210?
[136:07.69]We're starting at 2.
[136:19.82]No one's ever going to do that.
[136:21.22]I'm the only one on Earth that can do that.
[136:28.30]Now I have at least four or five attempts to break my world record.
[136:35.70]This is the current record.
[136:51.26]You stupid asshole.
[136:57.25]I have the world record.
[136:58.39]What do you mean, get the world record?
[136:59.73]I currently have it.
[137:00.73]Yeah!
[137:00.93]Yeah!
[137:18.78]The heel.
[137:19.94]Just fucking hit your head on it.
[137:25.81]Who cares?
[137:26.23]She's delighted with that.
[137:42.20]Kicking point at the world record.
[137:43.56]I got the world record last time.
[137:44.88]Why nobody care about this?
[137:58.97]One to enjoy.
[138:00.60]Even those in the plane above the stadium may notice what's going on here.
[138:05.24]The medal ceremony after a brilliant performance.
[138:30.88]Let's have a quick look at the medal standings.
[138:33.08]I got seven medals.
[138:34.32]I'm doing very good.
[138:35.46]Men's table tennis?
[138:36.44]Why am I in the finals for the men's table tennis?
[138:40.71]I just got beat absolutely horribly.
[138:45.41]Why am I in the finals?
[138:47.25]I still qualified?
[138:48.35]Table tennis taking center stage then as we look forward to this.
[138:53.74]As do a capacity crowd.
[138:55.38]This should be a great matchup.
[138:59.04]I'm done.
[139:02.86]Why did I qualify?
[139:04.66]Well, take advantage of it.
[139:05.58]Take advantage of the fucked up rules.
[139:07.41]Just try to win.
[139:10.57]I hate that.
[139:11.29]It shouldn't be illegal.
[139:12.31]The white shouldn't even be painted white.
[139:15.37]I don't know.
[139:29.65]Backhand to keep the rally going.
[139:34.03]Wow, that backhand.
[139:35.13]What a joy to watch.
[139:38.18]Makes a real mess of that backhand.
[139:39.70]Alright, that was like a wiffle ball.
[139:42.40]Forehand back across the net.
[139:44.66]That backhand will test his opponent.
[139:48.89]Oh, he's going to be disappointed with that forehand.
[139:52.71]He seemed a long way out of position there.
[139:54.75]There was just no way he was going to return it.
[139:59.28]Little shimmy Rally starting to build it's the forehand back over the net Yeah
[140:27.49]Damn it.
[140:27.99]There we go.
[140:28.51]Alright.
[140:28.79]I can beat this.
[140:30.05]Nope.
[140:30.29]Nope.
[140:30.51]Nope.
[140:30.69]It's tie game.
[140:31.65]First X for a special.
[140:32.51]I don't think I have... What?
[140:36.29]That's not real.
[141:03.14]Crowd's starting to get into the game as the rally starts building.
[141:06.26]There is definitely no argument there at all.
[141:08.86]He wins the point with that fantastic play.
[141:13.38]I don't know why I keep going for it, but you have to.
[141:22.44]This rally really starting to take shape now.
[141:25.38]Using his backhand shot.
[141:27.36]A fantastic forehand there.
[141:31.79]Oh, the stupid plastic ball landed on the other idiot's side.
[141:38.33]Good job.
[141:39.59]What are you saying?
[141:40.25]Wait, was this just like a complete just tearing ping pong apart?
[141:45.11]Yeah, spike it.
[141:59.79]Plays the forehand there.
[142:01.75]Forehand keeps the game in play.
[142:04.57]Oh, you'll be disappointed with that forehand.
[142:07.66]Alright, spike it.
[142:08.12]Wow, this is a really long rally now.
[142:10.72]Playing on the backhand.
[142:14.58]Smashes it over the net.
[142:19.12]Good.
[142:19.30]I need one more point and I win.
[142:21.26]It's another point one for him.
[142:23.27]Can he start to really build a significant lead now?
[142:26.51]Got it.
[142:27.65]Yes.
[142:27.91]Yeah.
[142:30.67]Wait, is this just for... How many games do I have to play?
[142:34.31]How many games of table tennis do I have to play?
[142:45.09]Best of three, but who... Is this... Are we the two best in the world?
[142:48.52]Or is this just for, like, seventh place?
[142:50.82]How does this work?
[142:56.70]Is this for bronze?

[143:31.22]Can I take the bronze medal and then just say I'm done?
[143:34.25]I don't even want the gold one.
[143:35.19]I don't even want to attempt.
[143:37.23]It's going to go in the stands.
[143:41.49]What an incredible rally.
[143:44.84]The crowd are really loving this.
[143:48.00]Great to see.
[143:48.76]He wins the point there with some fantastic approach play.
[143:55.55]That was awesome.
[143:56.61]How did I do that with my backhand?
[143:58.67]I did it with the other side of the paddle.
[144:07.28]I really am starting to play to the crowd now.
[144:10.20]And they are responding.
[144:11.90]What a fantastic .1.
[144:13.10]I thought it was going out of bounds.
[144:20.17]He just couldn't return it successfully.
[144:31.41]No speed lost on the ball there with the backhand.
[144:34.87]What a fantastic point.
[144:36.41]Here we go then.
[144:37.15]Serving for the match now.
[144:37.97]Alright, this is it.
[144:38.74]Can he take it?
[144:40.06]I will take it.
[144:40.84]Didn't get to the edge.
[144:44.40]Straight down the line.
[144:45.88]Then he'll lose that point.
[144:49.38]Was it waving to somebody in the crowd?
[144:50.70]What was that?
[144:56.11]So the rally really starting to take shape.
[145:00.29]Really can't afford to lose any focus now with this rally.
[145:04.41]Where on Earth is the point going to come from in this rally?
[145:07.78]What on Earth is the point of all of this?
[145:11.48]Great pressure from the other side of the table.
[145:14.08]He just wasn't up to scratch that point.
[145:15.84]Come on.
[145:17.91]Five, six.
[145:23.68]Crowd starting to get into the game as the rally starts building.
[145:27.29]Both players really matching each other now with this rally.
[145:32.03]Give me that bronze.
[145:33.05]Give me the bronze.
[145:34.01]Give me the bronze.
[145:34.85]This match ends and what a victory.
[145:43.96]He takes it.
[145:44.84]Two games to nil.
[145:50.72]Is it?
[145:51.22]Wait, I came in first?
[145:52.06]I came in third place?
[145:53.16]I was supposed to qualify?
[145:55.29]Bronze medal!
[145:55.99]I'm just realizing the name of the stream is called Silver Metals and I don't have any.
[146:19.63]I have three bronze medals and like six gold medals.
[146:23.39]Oh well.
[146:29.38]Well, this place is rocking and quite rightly so.
[146:34.20]The sheer joy and ecstasy on his face tells you everything you need to know about how much winning...
[146:43.64]Alright, let's go.
[146:44.50]Let's take a look at the tallies here.
[146:46.64]China.
[146:48.44]18.
[146:49.48]They're getting a lot of silvers.
[147:01.61]I gotta start to be ready here.
[147:02.71]Women's springboard?
[147:07.02]Men's 100, men's 400.
[147:13.00]No.
[147:14.73]Butterfly?
[147:15.23]100 sprint.
[147:17.05]Yeah, we'll do the 100 sprint.
[147:18.21]And this is the diving.
[147:19.25]I can't wait.
[147:30.90]You own two of the 23 possible world records.
[147:33.94]I'm ready.
[147:43.02]I want to do the high dive.
[147:43.80]This is not the high dive though, is it?
[147:45.18]No.
[147:46.68]Here comes gold medal Gwen.
[147:49.52]We got to get the gold medal.
[147:50.42]Press X to begin the dive.
[147:55.38]Press circle to enter a tuck somersault.
[148:07.98]And then hit it again.
[148:10.34]Then hit down.
[148:12.38]Push Eleanor to rotate the athlete.
[148:17.02]To get the perfect splash.
[148:20.30]Okay.
[148:26.59]Yeah, it's all about the splash.
[148:28.49]Square, square, down.
[148:38.84]Well, this is quite hard, not the most difficult.
[148:45.90]You can't help but wonder whether this diver has been affected by nerves.
[148:50.38]It is always a big thing to compete in an Olympic Games.
[148:55.83]Almost a full-on belly flop.
[148:57.25]We can take a look at the replay, but I'm sure the diver won't want to.
[149:00.79]They know just how badly wrong they got it.
[149:05.95]Alright, we're gonna do... Why are they abbreviated?
[149:09.29]Oh, shit.
[149:09.55]Okay, square.
[149:13.81]Is it square immediately?
[149:14.56]What the fuck is going on?
[149:36.75]I know, it hurts so bad!
[149:37.71]Japan!
[150:01.00]You would be feeling that for months.
[150:03.80]Okay, let me try this one more time.
[150:05.92]We're just going to do the easy one.
[150:08.22]I have to qualify.
[150:11.22]Circle down.
[150:17.51]Okay.

[150:59.90]Stop screaming.
[151:00.60]Relax.
[151:00.84]No splash?
[151:01.30]That's going to be tense.
[151:01.98]Alright.
[151:02.48]Do another really difficult one.
[151:05.10]Here we go.
[151:05.92]This thing is impossible.
[151:07.64]Has to pull this off.
[151:36.19]It's so funny.
[151:42.29]It's not even that funny, but it just is for some reason.
[151:44.65]I'm trying.
[151:45.19]Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[151:51.78]That was fucking awesome.
[151:55.26]That was incredible.
[152:01.01]I don't get extra points for doing something a human can't do?
[152:03.93]Okay.
[152:04.49]Oh, well.
[152:05.25]No, I can't retry.
[152:06.47]I can't.
[152:07.31]I got to swallow the loss.
[152:28.99]Those retries are for Olympic-level competition.
[152:36.78]The gold medal, Gwen, doesn't qualify.
[152:38.56]Oh, you're going to have to go get that name changed.
[152:42.02]100.
[152:42.04]So this is just run as fast as you can.
[152:45.88]Yeah, I think I did this already.
[153:15.62]What do you think?
[153:16.14]Should I do a two, three second head start?
[153:17.56]Five second head start?
[153:18.48]What do you think?
[153:19.72]Be a total asshole?
[153:20.50]Run backwards.
[153:21.86]I see you later, you fucking toads.
[153:52.88]Wait, doesn't Doping Dan already have the gold medal in the 100?
[153:57.25]Why are we doing this again?
[153:59.73]I'm gonna go what's the world record I'm going for it
[154:33.79]9.26.
[154:33.91]9.5.
[154:33.93]9.58.
[154:34.09]Let's get it right now.
[154:36.99]I'm ready.
[154:39.29]9.58.
[154:39.31]Yep, you are.
[154:39.80]Who still wants it with 50 meters to go?
[155:09.38]Welcome to the Olympic Stadium 80,000 people on hand here for the next event on this really has been brought to life the jewel of the Olympic crown and
[155:48.17]no lunging just run just forrest gump style running forward just don't even stop just keep going
[156:00.22]High schoolers have better personal bests?
[156:01.90]And 9.94?
[156:02.56]The world record is 9.58.
[156:03.30]You're telling me high school track and field?
[156:05.36]Computers are the world record?
[156:30.51]I just based this on myself.
[156:32.41]I did the mile in 16 minutes.
[156:38.58]And I just kind of walked.
[156:42.78]Back in high school when they timed it.
[156:45.88]I think I actually one year I really did try.
[156:49.20]I really got ready for it.
[156:52.64]Oh, I got put like in a wheelchair and like threw up behind a tree.
[156:55.30]I remember this.
[156:56.16]Have I told this story?
[157:01.37]I did the... You remember when your high school used to kind of track?
[157:06.60]You know, they did like the... Everybody's school had the different track and field.
[157:10.00]It was like a presidential and there were two different tiers of your health.
[157:15.55]And it was how far can you reach?
[157:16.67]How many times can you do a pull-up?
[157:18.33]How many push-ups can you do?
[157:19.53]You guys know this?
[157:23.92]Right, so it was during that.
[157:24.74]It was anything under, I believe, eight minutes, the mile.
[157:29.50]Anything under eight or nine minutes, I believe it was eight, was considered really good.
[157:34.88]One year, I really, truly wanted to do it well.
[157:38.20]And I got ready every day.
[157:40.32]I was trying to eat better, and I wanted to try to stay loose.
[157:44.54]And finally, the day came that we were going to do it, and I really gave it my all.
[157:49.89]I was running the whole time.
[157:51.17]I tried to get it under seven minutes.
[157:53.37]I believe I got somewhere around seven minutes of the mile.
[157:58.46]And then after I was so winded and so fucked up that I... Everyone was going back.
[158:02.58]It was gym class.
[158:03.18]Everyone was leaving.
[158:03.84]And I was... The world started closing in.
[158:08.08]I just kind of sat down for a second.
[158:09.44]There was the bleachers there at the time where my high school was.
[158:11.88]I just kind of sat and hung out there, and the physical education teacher came over, and she said, are you alright?
[158:18.72]Are you doing okay?
[158:19.38]Are you doing alright?
[158:20.02]I'm just like, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[158:22.00]And I ended up getting up a little bit, and I ended up puking behind a tree.
[158:24.59]I was like, hold on a second.
[158:25.63]I put my hand on a tree, and I just went behind it, and I puked behind it.
[158:29.09]And she saw it, and she was like, oh shit.
[158:30.75]She didn't say shit, but you know, I'm just paraphrasing.
[158:33.47]And she said, can you move, or can you walk?
[158:36.95]And I had to sit down, maybe four or five feet away from where I just threw up, with my back against another tree.
[158:44.35]And I was just like, I gotta, I can't.
[158:46.39]I gotta sit here for a few minutes.
[158:48.51]So they went and got a wheelchair and put me in the wheelchair, and she wheeled me through the high school.
[158:55.65]And I'm just like, I'm fine, I'm fine, everybody, I'm alright, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
[159:00.82]And then finally, like, I got some water, but just going down the hallway, like, with her pushing me in a wheelchair, it must have been just so strange to see me doing that.
[159:09.88]And then, I got some water, and I went to math class with a little note that just said, hey, this dude, I don't know what it said, probably two teachers talking to each other, probably just like, dude, this dude just fucking puked behind a tree.
[159:22.31]It's okay that he's, like, eight minutes late.
[159:24.64]Like, Dash, like, holy shit, talked to you at lunch.
[159:27.04]And they probably talked a lot, they probably talked shit about me and stuff, I bet they did.
[159:32.19]It's got a golden what?
[159:43.02]China.
[159:47.38]I got, um, it's getting close.
[159:52.48]Alright, we're going to do the 400 meter.
[159:53.60]We're going to do the 100 meter butterfly.
[160:11.22]wait was that last time you said you did it because that last time you had to run a mile you couldn't because your nutsack was all fucked up yeah that's true that's actually true I had I had I mean it's true I did I told you that when did I tell you that I told you guys about like my like I told you about that
[160:35.94]I went to the doctor and, like, I was... I was... I thought I had... I had something called, like, a testic appendix.
[160:43.40]And, like, my balls hurt all the time.
[160:47.58]When did I tell you that?
[160:48.86]Did I actually tell... I've been around for way too long.
[161:07.62]Alright, I got this.
[161:11.82]It's your doctor.
[161:12.44]He screams now.
[161:13.28]He told us.
[161:13.72]Well, that'd be really weird if my doctor, when I was like 15, was screaming right now.
[161:24.93]Alright, I got to really do well.
[161:27.51]I got to do well.
[161:33.43]tried finding other words right onto the line really as now the athletes take to their blocks as they emerge from the water we see the early leaders all eight athletes very very close through 25 meters and now can they lead from gum to the final touch
[162:02.50]I gotta be doing really well here.
[162:26.92]Record?
[162:27.66]Record?
[162:28.00]Olympic record.
[162:33.58]I can do better than that.
[162:35.60]Who cares?
[162:56.71]Guys, I have to have something to brag about for the next three months.
[162:59.43]Remember when I played the game and they got like 10 gold medals and they did like three or four world records and everyone was like, I need this.
[163:08.79]This is the Olympic Stadium, one of the most ecologically sound structures in the whole of world athletics.
[163:16.14]This stadium really is state of the art.
[163:19.32]80,000 in capacity and beautiful on the eye.
[163:25.29]This is not even... I'm not even winded.
[163:29.64]I just had a bad day.
[163:30.40]I'm thinking about something really sad.
[163:54.01]Do I have to finish?
[163:59.11]Am I going to get passed?
[164:09.12]Do they have to wait for me to finish?
[164:11.76]I hope so.
[164:17.83]France will qualify in first place.
[164:20.59]Austria will qualify for the final in second.
[164:23.97]And China take third that season qualified.
[164:35.82]I have to go puke behind a tree.
[164:42.07]Is the ground really hot?
[164:47.50]Am I walking around in bare feet?
[164:51.60]Quick, quick, somebody get the wheelchair for him!
[164:54.79]He went way too hard in the first ten seconds!
[165:05.41]The stadium is silent!
[165:29.65]Yes!
[165:36.56]Watch the replay?
[165:37.56]I don't know if I want to watch the whole replay.
[165:45.70]Why are they playing?
[165:46.50]What's this music?
[165:59.86]Did I break the game?
[166:00.68]Not the best performance by any stretch of the imagination.
[166:16.94]Just really struggled to keep it together.
[166:19.57]And I just wonder how much of an impact pressure and nerves had on this performance.
[166:24.79]They won't even show me.
[166:27.37]This is confirmation of the final standings.
[166:31.16]Who is loading the replay?
[166:36.94]Oh, geez.
[166:41.68]I almost want to do that whole thing and not even come off the pad.
[166:45.03]Just don't even start.
[166:46.27]And just see how long the timer will count.
[166:54.01]Do you think the game was ever programmed to be like, oh, is somebody going to sit here for 10 minutes?
[166:59.37]We'll have to try it.
[167:01.13]Alright, let's go for the world record.
[167:05.31]56.
[167:06.39]Two lengths and about 50 seconds separates this athlete from Olympic glory.
[167:16.39]At the quarter point, they emerge from the water and the early leaders show their heads.
[167:21.42]Still some distance to go, but at 25 meters, the early leader's in control.
[167:29.46]Stroke for stroke, she's striving for glory.
[167:36.10]Strong kick.
[167:37.74]In front, USA.
[167:40.30]In second is China.
[167:42.80]In third place, Canada.
[167:46.60]Three quarters of the race gone as we enter the closing stages.
[167:58.72]world record 56 56 what is it oh well let's take a look at the replay and there are no doubts in this one who was gonna win utter domination from start to finish damn it the power of an olympic champion and that's why they took gold
[168:27.27]It's one second ahead of that.
[168:38.98]I got the Olympic record already in the qualifier.
[169:00.93]Nine gold medals.
[169:04.03]I think this is the last day.
[169:05.17]Did we even see all the events?
[169:08.57]I don't think we even saw the events.
[169:11.41]This is not good.
[169:15.23]This last day, I've got to get two medals or I'm going to lose first place.
[169:21.46]Women's Freestyle and Women's 100 Freestyle.
[169:24.26]Oh, shit.
[169:25.12]I've got to make these good.
[169:37.00]China's in second place.
[169:37.88]I've got to keep it that way.
[169:39.32]Well, there's so much at stake here and only a tiny amount of time for these athletes to show exactly what they can do.
[169:47.15]Wait, this is just... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[169:48.37]Alright, alright, alright.
[169:50.37]Let's go.
[169:50.63]Let's get a qualify.
[169:51.77]Look to the middle lanes for the fastest swimmers.
[169:55.07]Set.
[169:56.72]Great start.
[169:59.72]Really good stroking.
[170:09.78]I get it.
[170:10.06]I get it.
[170:10.36]I get it.
[170:10.62]I get it.
[170:10.88]I get it.
[170:11.14]I get it.
[170:11.42]I get it.
[170:11.74]Sorry, I was just doing the thing where you play any game with anybody under the age of five.
[170:27.49]You let them win and then you kind of catch up and then you... Wait, I lost.
[170:32.01]This is bad.
[170:32.47]No, China didn't win.
[170:33.15]Not yet.
[170:33.47]Here it comes.
[170:34.51]Let's go.
[170:34.87]Old medal right now.
[170:59.93]Here we go then.
[171:00.81]The athletes are ready.
[171:01.73]Set.
[171:04.37]They're awake.
[171:09.89]Race starting to take shape as we reach the quarter point.
[171:13.79]Now starting to stroke well at the quarter point.
[171:19.58]Not strong enough here.
[171:25.44]What are you doing?
[171:27.93]The woman from the United States seems to be drowning!
[171:49.85]The Netherlands qualify in first place.
[171:53.52]Second place, Canada.
[171:55.16]Third place for Turkey, who qualify for the final.
[172:01.50]Eighth place for Team USA.
[172:06.27]Everything that could go wrong pretty much did go wrong.
[172:08.89]Technique just falling apart.
[172:11.07]Breathing patterns nowhere near.
[172:13.67]Didn't quite come up to the performance level we expected.
[172:23.68]Yes!
[172:23.98]We still in first place!
[172:26.12]Yes!
[172:52.98]We still get- Why do we get first if we're tied with the same amount of points?
[173:04.38]For the moment, the flame continues to burn here at the Olympic Stadium in London, but it has been a quite terrific Games.
[173:12.23]The performances have been every bit what you'd expect from the biggest show in the world of sports.
[173:20.63]So many iconic landmarks that have just become part and parcel of these games.
[173:25.68]And that's what London has really brought to the table.
[173:29.86]The flags wave in celebration after so many good performances.
[173:34.60]Old takes priority.
[173:36.56]On the track side, the nation's coming together as one for the last time at the 2012 Games.
[173:45.27]The city has hosted this magnificently, and this closing ceremony really does signify how the whole of the world has come together here.
[173:56.95]This was on Medium.
[173:59.02]Art has been unlocked.
[173:59.98]What is that structure?
[174:00.70]I've seen it in the background a bunch of times.
[174:02.98]What is that structure?
[174:03.72]The red one.
[174:24.25]That thing right there.
[174:31.35]We kept on showing that from different angles.
[174:35.26]I thought that was a roller coaster.
[174:40.60]I was in the distance.
[174:41.96]I was like, wait, what is that?
[174:43.08]I thought it was a roller coaster.
[174:44.76]I was like, oh, there's a park over here.
[174:46.08]It's like wherever the stadium in London is.
[174:47.83]It's not Big Ben.
[174:55.68]Hold on.
[174:55.92]Let's say events play.
[174:58.02]Here we go.
[174:59.52]Diving.
[175:02.47]Men's 3 meter.
[175:03.31]Men's 10 meter.
[175:05.97]Men's synchronized.
[175:08.15]What does that mean?
[175:08.73]Synchronized.
[175:11.55]Field.
[175:12.61]Long jump.
[175:13.41]We didn't do shot put.
[175:16.20]Track.
[175:16.78]We didn't do hurdles either.
[175:17.88]I want to do hurdles.
[175:20.88]Hurdles.
[175:23.62]Hurdles.
[175:27.50]Uh, triple jump and shot foot, yeah.
[175:29.64]Let's see, what else to... Back, backstroke.
[175:37.49]I think I'm pretty good at that.
[175:39.99]What else is there in here?
[175:40.63]Okay, I want three meter, ten meter.
[175:48.60]Three meter, ten meter.
[175:52.54]And then we'll, okay, that's, okay, let's go.
[175:53.92]I'm hard.
[175:58.66]Pair as individuals or pair up into national teams?
[176:02.95]What?
[176:11.54]Either two or four players must join.
[176:14.92]Why can't I do individual?
[176:18.90]Oh, because it's... Okay, okay.
[176:20.86]Right, because it's a synchronized... This synchronized shit can't be in here.
[176:30.68]Right.
[176:31.06]Okay.
[176:36.08]Take them off.
[176:41.41]Okay.
[176:41.73]No synchronized.
[176:45.47]Now what?
[176:45.95]Diving.
[176:46.29]That's diving.
[176:46.91]Shooting.
[176:47.55]Rapid fire.
[176:48.25]Ski.
[176:49.27]Already did those.
[176:50.09]Archery.
[176:52.53]No, already did gymnastics.
[176:53.69]Men's trampoline.
[176:54.59]Men's vault.
[176:56.85]Other sports.
[176:59.17]Skulls?
[177:01.84]I have no idea what skulls is.
[177:03.11]Do weightlifting again?
[177:17.30]I will.
[177:17.74]Let's do these ones first.
[177:25.58]I already beat the game.
[177:26.30]I don't have to do it again.
[177:27.68]We're doing just the extra stuff.
[177:29.92]Hurdles.
[177:30.34]I actually want to do some of my theories.
[177:34.40]Okay, so how... A doping Dan, obviously.
[177:38.00]He's got two or three gold medals.
[177:39.04]So how does this work?
[177:40.84]Okay, press X. You tap.
[177:49.27]Same way you do all the other ones.
[177:52.39]As you approach the hurdle...
[178:05.69]Why don't you bounce off of it?
[178:08.30]I get it.
[178:09.60]See if I can beat them all.
[178:10.32]Somebody said, you're going to play Fall Guys?
[178:13.36]Yes.
[178:13.58]Just not today.
[178:16.82]We'll do that probably next... We'll do that probably on Monday.
[178:19.62]Playing on Monday afternoon.
[178:21.66]Fall Guys.
[178:22.14]Well, here we go then.
[178:34.95]A great ovation for all eight athletes, but now silence.
[178:39.32]A good start to this, and that's vital in a field of this standard.
[178:42.32]50 meters to go.
[178:43.04]The leader is Jamaica.
[178:44.92]What a race this is.
[178:47.62]Jamaica finish with gold.
[178:54.05]It's much harder than it looks.
[178:55.99]In fourth place is France.
[178:58.17]Fifth place for Team USA.
[179:02.13]Look how far his legs are just spreading there.
[179:04.19]What the hell?
[179:04.59]Alright, whatever.
[179:05.39]Next event.
[179:06.21]Usually three steps, then jump.
[179:08.91]The timing is half the battle.
[179:10.81]Yeah, I probably feel like it'd be very difficult.
[179:33.32]What's his next one?
[179:36.04]I don't remember.
[179:38.24]Triple jump, right.
[179:39.28]How the hell does this work?
[179:41.17]Mm-hmm.
[179:42.07]So then you go... Run...
[180:02.15]Oh, this is the Mario thing.
[180:04.01]You get to go like... Right?
[180:07.65]I get it.
[180:08.81]That wasn't bad.
[180:09.53]Gonna call me on fault?
[180:10.65]Well, let's have another look at that.
[180:32.68]Not terrible.
[180:36.41]Well, not awful.
[180:37.79]Yeah.
[180:41.41]Thanks for saying everything I say.
[180:42.41]He's too hard.
[180:54.22]Well, that didn't go to plan, and he knows it.
[181:00.34]Great speed on the runway.
[181:01.54]Can he follow it up with good technique?
[181:03.22]Dude, this meter makes no sense.
[181:06.86]Well, that was a tough third round.
[181:14.41]We're now midway through this competition, and this competitor still has plenty to do.
[181:22.37]It's alright.
[181:23.31]I did alright.
[181:25.01]That was like something.
[181:27.35]This is not even... It's impossible.
[181:51.69]Early.
[181:51.81]That's got to be at least worthy of anything.
[181:53.05]That's worthy of something.
[182:19.32]not doing so well to start that was dumb I don't want to do that one anymore
[182:46.20]Now this is what I'm talking about.
[182:47.62]I'm ready for this.
[182:50.95]This is where I make my money.
[182:58.59]Rapidly tap X. Push.
[183:03.73]Not throwing straight loses power.
[183:05.41]Push up.
[183:09.93]Perfect throwing angle is 35 degrees.
[183:13.93]This athlete can't be the story of this games Not quite meeting the power No
[183:38.32]What happened there?
[183:39.40]Trying to get it to straight.
[183:40.50]I got four more chances.
[183:41.32]Come on.
[184:07.13]Don't make me fucking laugh!
[184:15.20]Look at him cheering.
[184:19.64]It's like a person.
[184:21.48]Oh, alright.
[184:22.50]I can't look at chat.
[184:23.29]Accordion!
[184:37.91]It's not funny, stop.
[184:41.39]Yes, it is.
[185:12.72]Wait for the angle I'm I'm trying to I'm I know I'm waiting Wait it comes down
[185:35.25]The scoreboard doesn't tell lies on this occasion, and this athlete is outperforming any... No complaints from the athletes about the facilities here.
[185:45.69]This really is a state-of-the-art stadium.
[185:55.78]Oh, this looks good.
[186:03.76]35, right?
[186:05.58]I'll get it.
[186:05.96]35 is the perfect angle.
[186:07.46]Oh, that was... It comes down fast.
[186:08.88]That's another good throw for Team USA.
[186:31.02]Let's take a check on the scoreboard.
[186:32.56]And it's Team USA in first place.
[186:34.90]Who ever said that?
[186:35.70]Jesus.
[186:42.68]How is that worse than the last one?
[186:46.85]And the technique at the end was very good.
[186:50.37]And that makes it a decent shot here.
[186:54.34]It looks like he's on the phone
[187:24.77]Last chance to get world record I already got the Olympic record.
[187:34.80]I gotta get the world Gold
[188:00.28]New Olympic record.
[188:03.18]See it quick across the circle and then explosive as the shot went flying high into the air.
[188:15.24]Great so much of those little shot put balls away.
[188:20.04]One final check on the standings then.
[188:22.14]What an event this has been.
[188:23.38]They have to be really heavy.
[188:26.32]They're 16 pounds.
[188:31.04]Wow.
[188:32.92]That's dense.
[188:37.08]That's insane.
[188:40.18]Alright, 100 meter backstroke.
[188:43.48]Not a seat to be had for the final of the men's 100 meters backstroke.
[188:51.14]Well, here we go.
[188:51.68]This athlete's one of the favorites in this competition.
[188:55.30]You start in the water.
[189:02.80]Into their stroke now as they emerge from the water.
[189:06.06]Pulling hard through the water at 25 meters.
[189:11.83]So nearly halfway, and it could be better for this athlete.
[189:22.75]And that's a strong push as the athletes come towards the surface.
[189:26.75]It's very close at the front.
[189:28.92]In first place, Australia.
[189:30.56]Come on.
[189:31.52]Germany in second place.
[189:33.84]In third place, USA.
[189:36.54]As we enter the final 25, less than a quarter of the race to go.
[189:44.15]Final stages now.
[189:45.03]First place, gold medal, Germany wins.
[189:49.98]second place and a silver medal for Australia I didn't choke it was I got to the end I realized I was in third fourth place and I just gave up the next event here we go is the final of the men's three-meter springboard finally we get to see me for real me
[190:18.41]There's so many options here for this diver.
[190:21.01]Is it a case of going for maximum difficulty?
[190:23.95]And it is risk and reward.
[190:25.71]The hardest dives bring you the most points.
[190:30.38]I was wrong?
[190:31.00]Will the big splash on entry have cost him dearly?
[190:34.44]The entry was poor.
[190:35.80]Let's take a look at the replay.
[190:37.08]He's dead?
[190:38.73]Good elevation, nice tuck.
[190:41.89]But when it came to stretching out...
[190:44.55]I got it.
[190:45.21]This is backwards.
[190:45.85]Not bad.
[191:11.95]I keep thinking of the accordion.
[191:13.17]It's fucking messing me up.
[191:14.37]I could just see the tiny little errors.
[191:17.61]No doubt there are a few nerves as the scores start to come in.
[191:20.77]God damn it.
[191:22.01]Alright, come on.
[191:24.20]Team USA needs to pick this one up.
[191:25.92]They've not been very good so far.
[191:27.84]They're back in seventh.
[191:31.18]Well, he's pulled out of that dive.
[191:35.16]Didn't feel comfortable on the ball.
[191:36.92]Excuse me?
[191:38.24]There will be another opportunity.
[191:39.54]Neese to compose himself here.
[191:48.04]Well, not bad.
[191:51.52]Let's take a look at the replay.
[191:53.86]Good degree of difficulty and well executed.
[191:56.46]That was not bad.
[192:00.02]7-7-7-8-8.
[192:00.48]Yeah, that was good.
[192:04.55]So after that round, six places.
[192:06.37]What this athlete's looking at is not ideal, but at least it's two places above the bottom.
[192:14.41]This is a big moment.
[192:15.87]A really...
[192:17.15]Dave, wait.
[192:17.87]Arcadum?
[192:18.41]Five community subs?
[192:19.29]What's going on, Arcadum?
[192:22.41]Thanks for the five subs.
[192:23.27]If you guys don't know Arcadum, how could you not know Arcadum?
[192:31.22]Best fucking goddamn dungeon master I've ever seen in my life.
[192:35.92]Go check him out.
[192:37.60]Thanks for the five subs, dude.
[192:40.13]You're doing well.
[192:42.41]And now it is over to the judges to get their view on this.
[192:48.54]The D&D god himself.
[192:50.45]That's true.
[192:51.11]Let's have a look at the leaderboard.
[192:52.33]Team USA are in fourth place.
[192:55.35]Does it get 10?
[192:58.47]Wait, I got a 10?
[192:59.71]No way.
[193:00.19]Wait, wait.
[193:01.01]Can I... Somebody clip that.
[193:01.87]I want to watch it.
[193:02.27]I didn't even see it.
[193:03.66]What happened?
[193:05.16]I got 10s across the board?
[193:08.72]Holy shit.
[193:10.85]Full tens.
[193:16.77]Oh, seriously.
[193:21.17]Thanks, Arcadum.
[193:23.39]We're playing, uh... We're playing Olympic Games.
[193:28.00]And I beat everything.
[193:29.04]I don't know what just happened, but that was fucking ten.
[193:32.92]That was ten.
[193:33.74]Had to be.
[193:34.46]That was unbelievable.
[193:35.72]That was the best thing I've ever done.
[193:38.91]Check this shit out.
[193:41.03]I have to adjust.
[193:41.43]I'm trying.
[193:41.71]It's left and right on the d-pad, right?
[194:07.93]Well, it's just a shame the end didn't quite match the start with that dive.
[194:14.52]Whatever.
[194:15.24]Let's have a look how the judges rated it.
[194:20.42]That's fine.
[194:21.40]Who gives a shit about three meter?
[194:22.58]I went with a 10 meter.
[194:29.71]He's a PC gamer.
[194:30.65]He doesn't know what a stick is.
[194:31.97]I know what it is.
[194:32.95]This is the one I wanted to do.
[194:33.95]Here's the huge one.
[194:34.81]This is the high dive.
[194:35.63]Wait.
[194:35.77]How do you do this?
[194:36.29]Oh, head in his hands.
[194:37.11]Utter frustration, I think, in the end.
[194:38.47]A shake of the head.
[195:00.51]Why does that look like a party in college?
[195:02.67]Hey, check this shit out!
[195:04.49]No, no, no!
[195:04.73]Bob, don't do it!
[195:05.23]I'm gonna do a big one!
[195:06.42]I'm going off the roof!
[195:07.60]Get him off the fucking roof.
[195:11.54]I don't want him on my fucking roof.
[195:12.92]That was a 10 difficulty?
[195:29.55]Dive number two.
[195:30.53]Still need to be careful what to choose here.
[195:33.10]Only this athlete knows.
[195:34.70]I'm going to give you a few minutes.
[195:36.34]It's going to take you a long time to get over this image, I think.
[195:39.26]Didn't like it.
[195:50.22]Didn't like that at all and pulled out just in time.
[195:58.87]I'd like to say that was nowhere near the best from the diver from the USA.
[196:04.52]God damn it.
[196:06.30]Well, let's have a look at the replay.
[196:08.12]Not enough elevation, not enough strength.
[196:11.18]Also seemed a little bit out of sync.
[196:12.88]The entry into the water will cost some valuable points.
[196:17.88]I'm trying to down... Seem to miss the timing of that dive.
[196:20.16]A shake of the head in frustration, and understandably so.
[196:25.13]this dude I'm hurting him didn't achieve what he set out to there I'm just doing the easy one fourth dive must select a good one here well did well to cram all of that into the routine but not quite why is this guy in the olympics
[196:47.37]I don't know.
[196:48.00]It's like the commissioner's son.
[196:49.08]Here's the replay.
[196:50.48]This one of the more simple dives.
[196:52.76]And this athlete really had to execute on this.
[196:57.36]Let's take another look at the scoreboard.
[196:59.55]I want to try something.
[197:04.31]Not massively difficult this dive.
[197:09.14]Forgettable.
[197:10.32]That was a forgettable performance.
[197:15.63]was wrong with that here's the replay and this diver may want to look away now that was just like dropping an action figure that will cost dearly off your treehouse it is the pool here's the scoreboard and team USA are in last place
[197:40.78]What the hell?
[197:41.58]Alright, that was fun.
[197:42.62]I'm doing the next one.
[198:08.64]I'm not done until we do the actual scientific hypothetical theory thing.
[198:17.66]Ooh, this is the vault.
[198:20.61]Okay, I'm looking forward to this.
[198:24.69]Stuck with it.
[198:25.49]Wait.
[198:26.75]Oh, this is not a pole vault.
[198:29.36]I thought this was the pole vault.
[198:36.19]Press into your somersault.
[198:39.21]From a 0.5 twist.
[198:41.98]And then hit down.
[198:42.70]It looks like it hurt.
[198:50.14]Alright, we're just going to do tuck.
[199:04.09]Why did gravity turn up times five when I got halfway there?
[199:29.14]so here come the judges scores well let's have a quick look at the scores at the end of that round and as you'll see I have a backpack with magnets on me and there's a negatively charged ion plate underneath me here it's great how could this one be hard well this is really interesting stuff now a medium difficulty selection could really turn out to be a good choice for this gymnast
[199:56.01]He gets up and goes, yep, I'm okay.
[199:59.93]Dead.
[200:01.13]You don't die.
[200:01.73]That shit's made out of taffy.
[200:03.13]I'm going to be fine.
[200:06.76]Alright, what am I doing wrong here?
[200:07.84]I'm trying to stick it with the left on the analog.
[200:26.05]That's too late.
[200:32.18]I won't do that one again.
[200:32.86]Skulls.
[200:36.44]What is Skulls?
[200:36.96]Wait, wait, it's a rowboat competition?
[200:39.00]Toriel.
[201:03.45]Press and hold the triggers to begin rowing.
[201:05.45]Release L2 to return the ores and do it again.
[201:21.27]Double tap to boost.
[201:29.66]Hey, you want me to show you everybody at the gym that uses this fucking thing?
[201:39.76]Did you know that rowing is the only sports where competitors cross the finish line backwards?
[201:51.60]I think you want to correct him.
[201:53.29]But like when you see somebody at the gym going like this.
[201:55.45]It's like, oh, no, he's just kind of going to do his thing.
[202:00.41]Okay.
[202:04.89]You got to go all the way.
[202:13.12]Save's gone.
[202:13.50]What?
[202:13.74]Why am I getting destroyed?
[202:36.77]Why is there so many people on bikes over there?
[202:40.85]Are there two events going on at the same time?
[202:52.14]Just losing to the bikes.
[202:53.26]I'm not racing the bikes.
[203:24.92]With its beautiful sights and situated not far away from Windsor Castle, this is one of the more picturesque venues.
[203:32.95]Set.
[203:34.07]Go.
[203:36.49]All six rowers pull away from the blocks then here.
[203:44.48]Well, this has been a decent performance so far, but needs to up the stroke rate here.
[203:50.50]Breathless day.
[203:53.16]Terrific conditions to Rowan.
[204:01.75]Great Britain, the front runner.
[204:02.97]This is an impressive performance.
[204:05.71]Good pace, this from China.
[204:07.37]Have a real chance of winning.
[204:09.35]Belgium are doing well here in third place.
[204:12.99]Just a bit off the pace, Team USA.
[204:14.95]They're back in sixth.
[204:28.05]Through 500 meters, that's the halfway point.
[204:34.18]Go faster?
[204:35.26]I can't.
[204:36.58]He needs to improve his stroke rate, otherwise there's no chance of a medal here.
[204:50.55]What's wrong with me?
[204:53.27]What's wrong with my guy?
[204:56.11]Why is he quitting?
[204:57.63]What's wrong with my guy?
[204:59.31]Great Britain take gold!
[205:16.45]Alright, if there were 10 people on this, I'm the one guy pretending to row and not doing any work.
[205:33.59]What's wrong with him?
[205:42.13]This hurts my arms and I'm not even doing it.
[205:56.63]Just pulling in and leaning back.
[205:59.44]Just chilling.
[206:04.78]Well, this is one that he won't want to see again.
[206:07.04]Not a particularly good performance.
[206:09.32]The stroke rate early on was down, and then when he needed to pull through, it didn't quite happen.
[206:14.02]The middle section just letting him down, and then coming down the home straight.
[206:18.26]We're really expecting more from this athlete, but on this occasion, he just couldn't quite put in the performance we were hoping for.
[206:26.44]Alright, I want to do some stuff.
[206:27.32]I want to do some things.
[206:36.98]Alright.
[206:37.58]Beach volleyball.
[206:39.63]Weightlifting.
[206:43.53]Karen.
[206:44.65]I did that, right?
[206:45.81]Kayak single with Karen.
[206:48.55]Isn't Karen the same thing?
[206:55.76]Did I do both?
[207:05.45]whatever alright I want to do so what's the last thing I don't think I really yeah let's just do these I want to do I want my theory to play out oh Karen's the bike right okay I want to say something
[207:32.11]He wanted to do the vault again?
[207:33.25]Oh, right.
[207:35.33]I'll do that before I go.
[207:37.47]Am I too late for flop jokes?
[207:39.13]No.
[207:39.33]Oh, I'm going to do 3D mode too.
[207:41.26]Yeah, there's still more to do.
[207:43.22]Hold on.
[207:43.60]Alright, here we go.
[207:44.24]Men's 100 meter.
[207:44.56]Here we go.
[207:44.88]Ready?
[208:02.11]Oh, it does it automatically.
[208:05.29]It does it.
[208:05.67]I can't do it.
[208:09.51]Walk?
[208:17.95]I wish I could.
[208:18.65]Walk?
[208:28.36]Okay.
[208:28.48]Let's check out the other one.
[208:29.44]I didn't do this one coming up.
[208:30.18]Yeah, I didn't do volleyball.
[208:58.00]I feel like I want to put in the Beijing one and play the other events that aren't in this game.
[209:02.15]We're going to do that.
[209:04.47]I'm putting in Beijing one.
[209:09.25]There's other events, I think, on this game that aren't out here.
[209:11.74]I'm going to just play them.
[209:16.22]Alright, serve bar.
[209:18.42]Wait, this is an actual game of volleyball.
[209:35.27]There's X before the target begins flashing.
[209:40.19]Use L. Old L. I get it.
[209:54.24]I know how to play volleyball.
[209:57.64]Alright, let's go.
[210:11.32]I'll put it in Beijing.
[210:13.54]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[210:15.20]I want to do... I'll put it in Beijing.
[210:17.85]I'm going to take a piss and go and put it in Beijing.
[210:23.83]Oh, yeah, 3D mode.
[210:24.65]Yeah, right, right, right, right, right.
[210:25.65]It's probably going to fuck up the TV.
[210:35.29]Is this going to fuck up the TV?
[210:41.56]How is this 3D?
[210:44.25]You just see it twice.
[210:45.13]You have to cross your eyes.
[210:58.87]Oh, you need the glasses.
[210:59.91]Okay, but hold on a minute.
[211:01.82]What the hell would 3D glasses do for this?
[211:09.50]What would it do?
[211:12.31]Do I need my individual eyes?
[211:16.33]You need to be a 3D monitor.
[211:17.99]Oh.
[211:18.71]Oh, okay.
[211:21.77]Alright, be right back.
[211:26.46]I'm going to put in Beijing and I'm going to go take a quick break.
[211:28.72]I'll be right back.
[215:18.88]Okay, hi.
[215:19.76]Um, why is this taking so long to make a save profile?
[215:26.70]Saving please not switch the power off.
[215:28.96]And just take one second.
[215:33.13]Wow, is it saving 10 gigs of space?
[215:35.05]I don't understand.
[215:41.51]Why is it taking so long?
[215:50.52]What do you want us to tell you?
[215:51.78]Make me, I don't know, make me feel better.
[215:53.15]Say, I don't know, did your PS3 is just working hard?
[216:03.91]I can hear it.
[216:04.89]Can you guys hear the weird little like... Switch it off, switch it off, switch it off.
[216:10.18]What do you mean?
[216:11.76]It's fine.
[216:13.20]It's just an old PS3.
[216:20.36]Yeah, so this is 2008, so we're probably going to lose some physics and some graphics on the way back.
[216:36.18]The whirring of the hard drive?
[216:37.32]Yeah.
[216:37.70]Okay, I think we're good, aren't we?
[216:42.39]I think we're good.
[216:44.03]I probably need to change the title, huh?
[216:50.76]Powered by GameSpy.
[216:52.20]That's very old.
[216:53.20]2008.
[216:57.49]The official Olympic Games.
[217:05.75]2008.
[217:08.49]Already looks a little crusty.
[217:09.70]Didn't you already do this?
[217:29.43]Some features of the competition are only available with sound.
[217:31.20]I don't care.
[217:33.70]Play on this system.
[217:40.12]Track.
[217:42.64]Okay.
[217:45.48]Field.
[217:46.46]Okay, hold on a minute.
[217:47.98]There's hammer throw.
[217:52.47]Let's do 100 meter.
[217:53.13]100 meter.
[218:01.38]This does look like a racing game.
[218:02.68]You're right.
[218:03.02]It does.
[218:05.64]Diving.
[218:06.20]Let's do diving.
[218:12.96]Parallel bars.
[218:14.24]Rings.
[218:14.74]Floor exercise.
[218:16.00]Beam uneven bars.
[218:17.40]Yeah.
[218:20.43]Shotgun.
[218:21.25]Air pistol.
[218:22.03]We did these.
[218:23.85]Let's do air pistol.
[218:26.99]Archery weightlifting.
[218:29.85]judo combined events decathlon okay I'm ready let's do it I'm looking forward to judo
[219:01.16]Hey, I'm back from the PlayStation stream.
[219:02.88]It sucked.
[219:04.46]Wait, like an official PS PlayStation stream?
[219:07.23]What are they doing?
[219:07.75]What are they talking about?
[219:10.23]Anything interesting?
[219:17.89]This feels like an old SEGA game.
[219:20.38]I hold L2 and R2 to build power.
[219:25.40]Once the power bar hits the red zone, you'll launch from the blocks...
[219:32.05]Press X and O alternately or toggle L and R to build up speed.
[219:38.05]This is way more complicated than 2012.
[219:40.51]Press R2 to showboat.
[219:46.49]Alright, let's go.
[219:51.33]Where am I?
[219:57.67]Just showboat the whole time.
[220:03.77]Lane 4, Australia.
[220:08.83]Lane 5, the United States of America.
[220:11.53]Well, that's me.
[220:13.81]Lane 6, Spain.
[220:17.97]Alright, hold L2 and R2.
[220:24.46]Okay, here we go.
[220:28.64]What?! !
[220:53.21]Who the fuck is that guy?
[220:54.65]What's that guy doing?
[220:55.77]Why is there a waiter here?
[220:59.29]Oh no, that's an official.
[221:00.43]Okay.
[221:00.71]Alright, I lost.
[221:08.70]That one's way more complicated than the first.
[221:13.40]I said first game, but it's the second game.
[221:15.04]First game of the night.
[221:19.88]I can't wait to do hammer throw.
[221:21.90]If I knew that hammer throw was an Olympic sport, I probably would have tried to do it.
[221:25.67]That sounds like fun, just whipping a hammer as hard as you can.
[221:27.97]I get why people do this shit.
[221:32.13]That's fun.
[221:44.78]Throw a hammer as hard as you can.
[221:46.02]You got it.
[221:51.95]Oh, it's this.
[221:56.35]It's the back the fuck away from me.
[221:59.91]Or I cannot control if you die or not.
[222:03.90]Event.
[222:04.40]Holy shit, this is going to be impossible.
[222:11.40]I don't... Hold on.
[222:12.30]Can we do that again?
[222:12.94]Okay.
[222:22.10]So you start spinning.
[222:24.58]Rotate L to match the marker.
[222:30.18]Press L2 or R2 to release the hammer.
[222:35.81]What direction should I throw the damn thing? ...
[222:55.48]He's going to wreck somebody in the crowd.
[222:59.04]Now that's what the fence is for.
[223:03.10]Long shot.
[223:04.36]It's a very long close-up of this guy's face.
[223:12.09]I mean, is it skip or is it continue?
[223:15.63]At this point.
[223:16.11]What would you say?
[223:17.25]Did I skip it?
[223:30.52]No.
[223:40.14]Do not skip.
[223:40.94]You're skipping.
[223:41.70]Don't skip.
[223:42.26]No skip.
[223:42.72]Don't skip.
[223:43.77]Yes.
[223:47.57]Alright, let's go.
[223:51.27]Okay, just gonna match the... Match it with the meter surrounding him.
[224:02.92]Wait, I'm not the ball.
[224:07.60]I thought I was the ball.
[224:08.74]I thought I was the ball.
[224:09.84]I thought the ball was my movement and not the... Okay, I get it.
[224:19.60]Why wouldn't I be him turning and not... I'm the meter turning?
[224:23.57]Come on.
[224:42.94]Okay, I'll get it this time.
[224:44.22]We go!
[225:04.66]Not bad!
[225:14.36]That's alright.
[225:14.86]64 meters.
[225:15.20]At least two AIs talking to each other.
[225:16.60]That's what it sounds like.
[225:50.02]Yeah, it is.
[225:50.48]Yeah, it is.
[225:51.45]But I'm... You know what I mean though.
[226:11.69]Foul?
[226:13.51]You can take that long to tell me it was a foul?
[226:22.71]You could have done it immediately.
[226:26.83]That's pretty good!
[226:39.48]Ooh!
[226:55.91]Damn it.
[227:01.13]I can do it again.
[227:01.81]I can be better with the ball.
[227:05.59]That's hard to do.
[227:06.27]I'll get it.
[227:18.53]That's gonna be a fucking world record right there.
[227:23.43]Right?
[227:25.32]measure that shit that's above the world record yep did it that's he's doing the hulk hogan that's what I would do that's a great celebration
[227:59.57]Three fouls and world record.
[228:02.65]All it takes is one, man.
[228:04.29]Nice.
[228:30.16]Alright, let's hear it.
[228:31.20]It's time for the music.
[228:35.77]Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the National Anthem of the United States of America.
[228:41.83]Copyright?
[229:05.63]I don't think you can get DMCA'd with a national anthem.
[229:21.17]You're going to get sued.
[229:25.73]What was next?
[229:26.25]There was a lot of shit on this list.
[229:28.25]I'm looking forward.
[229:29.11]Some of them were crazy.
[229:37.11]Disney owns it?
[229:37.93]I think the day that happens, that's the turning point for society just to collapse.
[229:44.22]Like, absolutely collapse.
[229:52.40]Like, if Disney copyrights the National Anthem, you're going to be eating your food out of an old can that's in your basement.
[229:58.34]Like, there's no way.
[230:00.98]Oh, here we go.
[230:01.34]This is a big one.
[230:05.83]Like, dive power.
[230:18.31]Anybody understand this?
[230:19.39]Rotate L to match the green marker and R to match the red marker.
[230:24.38]Oh.
[230:29.76]Do I get to pick my dive?
[230:37.87]Oh, here we go.
[231:06.28]Wait, where are the balls?
[231:12.50]Oh, I get it.
[231:13.10]Okay, I get it.
[231:13.68]You have to... I thought I was the balls again.
[231:21.33]This is fucking horrible.
[231:39.09]I get it.
[231:39.45]Yeah, that's hard to do.
[231:51.32]It's like scratching your belly and patting your head at the same time.
[232:05.56]Why does it have to be in slow motion?
[232:34.98]That was pretty damn good.
[232:36.66]That would have been at least an 8 or a 9.
[232:40.20]This one's not as flashy as the other one.
[232:45.60]Let's see what happens if you just completely fuck the whole thing up.
[233:01.99]I'm going to try to not get any points.
[233:19.03]Harry Potter whispering thing.
[233:24.39]Actively pretending.
[233:25.33]Yeah, I guess you just do the move, but... Depending on how long they were in the... I better get a zero, right?
[233:39.10]Okay.
[233:39.48]I don't want to do that again.
[233:49.23]How do I speed time up?
[234:04.10]This game is way worse.
[234:06.22]Yeah, it is way worse.
[234:09.38]Well, we haven't gotten to judo yet, so hold on.
[234:11.54]Hold that thought.
[234:32.34]Alright, that's it, right?
[234:34.53]That's it.
[234:34.79]You have to dive ten times?
[234:49.17]What?
[234:53.87]No, I don't.
[235:11.15]I don't know how you make the high dive not fun in a video game.
[235:18.20]Is that even possible?
[235:19.14]Alright, cool, good.
[235:33.95]Saw a waiting room?
[235:34.75]I don't even know where that disc is.
[235:37.11]It might even be gone.
[235:39.66]I have no idea where the sawdisk is.
[235:50.56]This is giving me so much anxiety.
[235:52.16]Holy shit.
[235:53.02]Wait, why?
[235:59.56]Skip to saw 2.
[236:00.78]I have to buy saw 2.
[236:02.20]I don't own it.
[236:03.74]I'm gonna play it though.
[236:06.02]Here we go.
[236:06.76]Now it's time to fucking hog it.
[236:18.25]Alright, parallel bars.
[236:19.29]I'm gonna do all kinds of crazy shit up here.
[236:24.18]There's L2 and R2 until vertical to achieve a good lift.
[236:29.98]So you go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[236:31.74]Okay, then how do you trick?
[236:32.68]Move L and R left or right to position the arrows beneath the hands.
[236:38.91]Okay.
[236:44.62]Press the displayed buttons in order for the perfect dismount.
[236:47.99]Okay, let's go.
[236:54.39]Sounds like WarioWare.
[237:04.52]Jump up or no?
[237:09.54]How do you approach this?
[237:11.24]Oh, like that.
[237:25.67]Here we go.
[237:30.78]I'm doing that, I guess.
[237:39.68]Pretty good.
[237:40.20]Wait, what's this?
[237:49.74]This is just like lining up minigame line thing.
[237:52.94]I'm not even doing anything.
[237:54.40]It's just placed weird circle underneath where he is.
[237:57.50]I'll tell you, if you ever have a- wait.
[238:10.07]What?
[238:15.55]Oh.
[238:19.16]Game's quiet?
[238:20.37]Oh shit.
[238:31.45]I lost.
[238:34.17]Game sucks.
[238:34.81]The London one's better.
[238:35.85]I know, I know.
[238:37.09]But we gotta see the events that I didn't play in London.
[238:40.13]Turn it back down?
[238:45.26]There was one guy?
[238:45.96]Okay.
[238:51.29]Play the 2016 one.
[238:51.69]What is it for?
[238:53.99]Is there a PS4 and Xbox One?
[239:06.84]I was under the impression that after 2012 the games would really just awful.
[239:12.34]Keep the fucking arrows.
[239:13.89]I'm not- I want to keep the arrows.
[239:15.17]How do I skip this?
[239:36.34]These little mini games.
[239:38.40]I'm not even controlling anybody.
[239:42.45]Just fall off.
[239:44.53]Just fall off.
[239:47.11]Don't hold it.
[239:47.55]Just fall down.
[239:50.27]Fall down.
[239:52.57]Fall.
[239:55.88]It's just gonna play the animation no matter what.
[240:01.92]It's just based on how many... That's sad.
[240:05.22]Sad.
[240:14.53]Yeah, 2012 was way better.
[240:22.62]Thank god we're out of that.
[240:23.60]I need to get to judo first.
[240:24.86]And there's a shooting one.
[240:31.96]Ooh, discus throw, but throw the disc in real life.
[240:42.75]I wonder how far I could throw a disc.
[240:46.50]frisbee style what do you think I could probably get it doesn't weigh that much I'm gonna say 25 feet 30 feet is that really undershooting it there 40 feet I could do more than 40 feet
[241:07.24]I could probably get... Please don't have... Please let me walk around.
[241:11.56]Please.
[241:12.42]Please let me walk around.
[241:14.38]Please don't have it be a minigame.
[241:15.36]Let me walk around and do moves.
[241:16.95]Please.
[241:17.99]That's it?
[241:27.99]That's it?
[241:32.09]That's it?
[241:35.41]I can't walk around with the analog and jump and stuff.
[241:37.97]Come on.
[241:38.65]None of this matters.
[241:42.83]I'm going to hit every button randomly.
[241:46.85]David Cage game.
[242:03.33]The only difference is the story there.
[242:05.71]No story here.
[242:06.69]Look at me!
[242:14.07]What do you think my floor exercise would be?
[242:24.70]Dude, what if I did like a Jerma Olympics?
[242:30.91]I just got a bunch of like my drunk friends to come and do like random things.
[242:35.41]Like floor exercises and stuff.
[242:40.97]And then you guys would have to vote on who wins.
[242:45.44]I kind of like this idea.
[242:53.00]I need that.
[242:53.72]I wonder how, I wonder what that would actually take.
[243:03.87]Last time you did a floor exercise, you left for two months.
[243:06.12]Well, I wouldn't participate in that.
[243:07.82]Well, I could do a floor exercise.
[243:11.34]I didn't have to move around that much.
[243:12.44]I could just fucking pantomime and move my hands and do, like, magic tricks and stuff.
[243:18.44]That was awful.
[243:27.21]This game is awful.
[243:27.93]It's truly awful.
[243:35.41]One of these has to pop out and make us happy, right?
[243:39.92]Something's got to pop out here.
[243:41.00]Did you do Mario and Sonic?
[243:52.07]There is a new one, isn't there?
[243:57.51]No, I don't even want to do it.
[243:58.51]I know what it's going to be.
[243:59.47]I already know what it's going to be.
[244:01.11]I don't want to even see it.
[244:03.29]I already know what's gonna happen.
[244:04.45]It's gonna be just stand still while I just press X once.
[244:12.18]What?
[244:14.28]That doesn't matter.
[244:23.14]It's Tony Hawk grinding.
[244:31.41]You can actually fall.
[244:35.82]By the way, I always saw this as the most difficult thing that a human being could do.
[244:42.64]In any, doesn't matter what, no matter what it is.
[244:45.86]This, Pete, doing a backflip and landing on this, and not shattering every bone in your body is insane that you can do a backflip and land on here.
[244:54.75]Do like a backflip and spin four times in the air.
[244:58.41]It's a cartoon.
[244:59.31]It's not even possible.
[245:06.94]Name something harder than this.
[245:07.98]What is harder than this?
[245:16.06]Doing surgery on somebody.
[245:20.16]Uh... I mean, that's hard, but is it as hard as doing a backflip on a one-inch beam?
[245:28.58]And staying up and doing all kinds of, like, look at me!
[245:30.81]And all that.
[245:41.93]Shattering your bones.
[245:42.79]Do you know what they're made out of?
[245:43.77]Wood?
[245:46.54]This is like a block of hard foam wood shit.
[245:49.70]I don't know what it is.
[245:51.60]No, not wooden bones.
[245:58.93]The actual banister thing.
[246:00.41]What is it made out of?
[246:15.84]Guys, if your body was made out of wood, opening and closing your car door would just hurt you every day.
[246:28.07]Walking up the stairs would be hell.
[246:30.95]Oh my god, I thought this was gonna be so much fun.
[246:33.95]I thought this was gonna be so fun with all these different gymnastics events, and they got rid of them in 2012 because they realized that they couldn't figure out a way to make it fun.
[246:42.26]That's why none of them are here!
[246:58.72]They could, they just didn't.
[247:00.22]That's true.
[247:02.20]Thank God it was quick.
[247:04.56]Judo better not be like this.
[247:05.64]I better be able to hit circle to punch and X to kick or I'm going to be really mad.
[247:12.84]If judo is a rhythm game, I'm going to pull the disc out.
[247:21.44]You heard it.
[247:21.90]If judo is a rhythm game, I'm pressing the release disc button.
[247:36.36]I'm not going to snap the disc.
[247:37.32]It's dangerous.
[247:38.22]I don't do dangerous things on stream anymore.
[247:50.88]You don't kick in judo.
[247:52.12]You don't?
[247:56.04]There we are, finally.
[247:57.24]Now we can actually get some goddamn action.
[248:03.55]I didn't do the tutorial.
[248:10.72]You gonna shoot?
[248:14.40]What?
[248:17.52]Why am I setting up a math problem?
[248:29.09]What's the point of the first one?
[248:33.23]What's the point of using graph paper?
[248:47.28]It's pulling me down.
[249:02.66]The hand getting tired.
[249:03.78]Why can I not set that every time?
[249:13.73]By the way, do they shoot bullets?
[249:18.71]Or is this like pellets or something?
[249:19.99]By the way, what's going on here?
[249:26.31]It's just, hold on.
[249:28.12]Okay, I thought I was going to keep shooting the same spot where 8 was.
[249:39.91]Yeah, what is going on with these glasses?
[249:49.26]What are those?
[249:51.00]Is one of them a magnifier and the other one... Is this a jeweler?
[249:54.42]Is he working on diamonds?
[249:55.51]I don't know.
[249:55.93]What is this for?
[250:00.27]Looks like a Warcraft gnome.
[250:01.79]This is crazy.
[250:08.17]What is it for?
[250:13.46]I kind of want to try these on.
[250:19.92]Just close one eye and just look through kind of the magnified one.
[250:22.38]I think I would like these in real life.
[250:27.30]If I was able to switch those down.
[250:28.74]+2 perception.
[250:43.61]Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[250:55.15]nine I'm not even trying I'm just kind of hitting things nine look at me hey look at you I'm not trying but at least I get to play 10.7 10.7 is not just 10.0 there's higher than 10.
[251:33.34]You can get extra in the middle.
[251:34.68]You can get in the middle of the middle.
[251:52.01]Yeah, I guess I lost.
[251:53.17]Didn't even place.
[251:56.73]Archery.
[251:57.59]Okay.
[251:58.29]Welcome to Archery.
[252:00.14]This one should be fun.
[252:02.28]I thought the controller was on her head.
[252:05.24]I thought it was like, what's with all these weird apparatuses?
[252:07.48]I thought that was something on her head.
[252:11.29]Okay, wait.
[252:14.33]Whatever.
[252:25.24]Let's go.
[252:32.60]Do you think they're ever gonna make a game that uses the Huntsman style bow and arrow mechanics in an actual video game?
[252:45.69]I want it so bad.
[252:46.61]TF2 has that.
[252:57.31]Yeah, it's been like 12 years.
[253:02.17]I'm not ta- I- I- Hey, I'm not saying... Hey.
[253:06.33]Gimme a game that was- Gimme a game eight years ago that came up with this.
[253:09.53]I want one now.
[253:12.13]And I want it to be like a single-player game.
[253:13.77]I don't want it to be online, because people are way better than me online, and they'll just shoot me with a bow and arrow in the head first before I can shoot them.
[253:18.47]So I want to do it at my own pace, with my own single-player time.
[253:22.97]Not in Minecraft.
[253:23.69]I'm talking where the whole game's based around, like, awesome, perfect, incredible archery mechanics.
[253:31.34]Just bow and arrow.
[253:32.30]Just perfect.
[253:33.52]Like they spend three years making it perfect.
[253:45.81]Horizon?
[253:48.29]No, it's not.
[253:48.98]No, it's got to be first person.
[253:50.44]It's got to be first person.
[253:59.32]I thought it was actually going to hit still.
[254:02.88]Just make it yourself.
[254:05.80]I don't... I don't know shit about making video games.
[254:13.54]Four.
[254:15.96]Forehead.
[254:16.44]Crisis 3?
[254:16.82]Is it good?
[254:17.28]Nine.
[254:33.44]Crysis is a weird game.
[254:34.46]I feel like I've never played Crysis before, but I know I've played it.
[254:37.67]But it sits in this weird place in my memory where I may as well have never even opened it once.
[254:43.39]I don't remember anything.
[254:51.57]To me, Crysis and Far Cry just blend together into the same video game in my head.
[255:01.94]Ten.
[255:02.26]Ten.
[255:10.61]They're very different.
[255:11.31]Yeah, I don't know why.
[255:12.61]It's just that's the case.
[255:16.77]You know what I think it probably is?
[255:17.67]There's like seven bar cries and like four crises.
[255:23.10]I just feel like they're all... There's a lot of them.
[255:27.38]How many crises are there?
[255:33.04]Three?
[255:33.42]It's four, right?
[255:46.76]it's 2020 bro every day there's a new one is that guy wearing flowers as a watch I skipped it way too quickly it looked like it hey come alright judo here comes the judo dream no it's weightlifting
[256:14.17]Rotate Eleanor in opposite directions to increase power.
[256:22.17]Slowly rotate Eleanor outwards from the bottom.
[256:24.79]This sucks.
[256:25.73]472 pounds.
[257:18.22]I can't even.
[257:19.22]Alright, let's rotate different directions.
[257:23.32]That's so hard to do.
[257:24.44]I'm going to try with two hands.
[257:27.10]My fingers bump into each other because it's a fucking PlayStation!
[257:35.80]Why would you do that?
[257:38.58]If you put both your thumbs on the analogs and you rotate opposite directions, your thumbs hit each other in the middle.
[257:46.79]That's the most bogus fucking thing in the world Pick up a PlayStation 3 controller right now Rotate it in opposite directions and come in and meet in the middle and you tell me that your thumbs don't touch Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope
[258:15.99]You fat dumbass.
[258:16.91]No I don't.
[258:17.45]I'm not even gonna look.
[258:48.86]I feel like we could have a company meeting.
[258:52.41]Everybody, okay, let's talk about this.
[258:54.47]Alright, yes, let's go over the day here.
[258:57.85]So, it's done.
[259:01.09]Alright, the game's done.
[259:02.27]It's ready to ship.
[259:03.83]It's not fun at all.
[259:05.23]It's like the opposite of fun.
[259:08.52]I don't know what may have... I don't know.
[259:09.64]Wait, hold on.
[259:10.20]I'm lifting.
[259:10.64]I'm lifting.
[259:14.76]Turn your arms out!
[259:17.74]What?!
[259:17.98]Ten, two...
[259:45.62]Do it, turn it up, man!
[259:47.62]You alright?
[260:00.35]Do it!
[260:04.21]I lifted it.
[260:04.95]What do you mean no lift?
[260:05.89]He put it over his head.
[260:08.82]He put it over his head.
[260:19.86]Let's see if he lifts it.
[260:22.56]Nope.
[260:25.30]I don't think he lifted it.
[260:28.27]I don't think he did it.
[260:33.83]What was I saying?
[260:35.33]It doesn't matter.
[260:53.22]Come on, you can do it.
[260:53.78]Come on, you can do it.
[261:06.25]Balance.
[261:13.55]That's personal best.
[261:14.59]That's the world record.
[261:15.47]230 kilograms?
[261:15.91]Wait.
[261:26.07]What's 474?
[261:30.65]I couldn't make it that high.
[261:38.35]Wait, that's the lowest, the minimum weight.
[261:46.92]That's so funny.
[261:50.20]That's the minimum.
[262:07.96]This is it.
[262:08.76]This is the only reason why I stuck around for this long in this game is for judo only.
[262:15.04]You understand?
[262:15.64]I'm going to get punch, kick, throw, jump.
[262:21.59]It's not good.
[262:22.53]Yep.
[262:22.95]Okay.
[262:24.89]Match the arrows to gain an advantage.
[262:29.64]Once you have the advantage, press a combination of this.
[262:32.44]Just punch, punch, punch, punch, kick, punch, fight.
[262:35.50]Throw and reduce.
[262:36.30]Okay.
[262:42.18]When performing a hold or a pin, press R2L2.
[262:45.03]I don't, I kind of don't, I didn't, I don't get any of that, but it's alright.
[262:48.29]Let's go.
[262:48.73]Here we go.
[262:49.13]81 to 90 kilograms.
[263:11.67]This isn't a rhythm game.
[263:28.68]Nah, you didn't get me.
[263:31.64]Oh shit!
[263:34.00]What happened?
[263:37.62]Is this judo or are we trying to take the tags off of each other's shirts?
[263:41.90]Escape?
[263:50.39]Wait.
[263:54.00]Who won?
[264:16.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[264:32.94]Doesn't read the rules.
[264:34.46]I didn't read the rules.
[264:35.32]It said move, move, move.
[264:38.08]L2, R2, R2, R2, R2, R2, R2.
[264:40.68]And then mash the face buttons.
[264:54.50]Okay, I'm ready.
[264:55.24]Let's go.
[265:01.38]Throw him.
[265:09.84]Nope.
[265:12.14]What is this?
[265:13.76]E-pawn?
[265:15.18]What's wrong with me?
[265:16.96]What is it?
[265:17.88]Was he doing the mandible claw?
[265:19.41]What just happened?
[265:30.66]Why did I just fall down?
[265:48.04]Alright.
[265:48.72]Okay.
[265:49.14]Okay.
[265:49.74]Alright.
[265:50.12]I'm done.
[265:51.22]I'm done.
[266:01.15]Why would you play the judo one if you don't know what judo is?
[266:03.39]I know judo is an event.
[266:05.29]It's a martial art.
[266:06.07]We throw people in.
[266:08.97]If you get pinned, you lose.
[266:17.67]Is that end of the stream voice?
[266:22.22]Yeah, it probably is.
[266:25.24]It probably is.
[266:31.45]It probably is.
[266:37.83]That is accurate.
[266:39.35]Actually, I didn't do disc throw.
[266:41.53]Which is, I want to do that.
[266:46.33]Not like it's going to be any fun.
[266:50.45]But I plan on playing Fall Guys is what we're doing next.
[266:54.18]We'll play that.
[266:59.84]Throw the disc out the window.
[267:01.82]No.
[267:03.02]Guys, I'm going to put this back on eBay for $1.05.
[267:05.06]I think that's what it was.
[267:06.76]It was like $1.
[267:07.48]It was $1.10.
[267:08.24]It was not more than $1.
[267:10.75]I know it wasn't.
[267:11.25]It wasn't more than $2.
[267:11.93]If it was, then that's sad.
[267:16.83]When is Movie Night for real?
[267:18.13]I'll give you that.
[267:18.59]I would give that to you right now.
[267:21.25]So, the DLC... That came up on me out of nowhere.
[267:26.47]DLC Movie Night...
[267:29.14]At least like part one is going to be on Saturday.
[267:36.75]Saturday the 29th.
[267:37.99]I think that gives me and some of the mods a lot of time to really get a good playlist.
[267:50.05]I don't want to do it just like in the next week because I feel like there's a lot.
[267:53.09]There's hundreds of them.
[267:55.98]I really want to be able to go through those.
[267:58.45]So, Saturday the 29th.
[267:59.71]Mark it on your calendar.
[268:01.69]That's DLC movie night.
[268:06.85]So long from now.
[268:08.40]It's going to go by real quick.
[268:09.84]I promise.
[268:11.96]Attempt one.
[268:26.98]I don't get it.
[268:27.40]I don't know how it works.
[268:29.82]But I will see you guys again.
[268:30.90]This is the first time I've done two streams in a row since coming back.
[268:37.04]I have some stuff to do over this weekend.
[268:39.63]I'm gonna go do it.
[268:43.93]I'm gonna take care of it.
[268:45.55]And I'll see you guys on Monday.
[268:48.19]Still continuing to ease back into live streaming.
[268:53.29]And I feel okay.
[268:54.03]I actually feel okay.
[268:54.89]I feel pretty good.
[268:57.62]But I don't want to push it.
[269:01.16]I don't really want to do three days in a row.
[269:04.42]I really want to get up and move around.
[269:07.20]But I will see you guys on Monday.
[269:12.17]I think that's a good place to start.
[269:13.61]We'll probably do Monday, Tuesday.
[269:19.19]Probably Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.
[269:22.61]If I would say next week.
[269:23.73]I think that makes a lot of sense.
[269:28.20]For those of you that might be out of the loop, I know I say this at the end of every stream, the last three or four streams since I've come back, but I'm going backwards to streaming less.
[269:41.05]Sort of how long I streamed and times I streamed before moving to Vegas.
[269:46.27]I streamed probably three days a week back when I was in Massachusetts for about four to six hours.
[269:52.11]So we're going back to that.
[269:56.20]This medical stuff is still ongoing, so I'm going to keep it that way.
[269:59.56]I'm going to keep it like it was a few years ago.
[270:04.80]So, I've had a lot of fun, though.
[270:06.97]Spongebob was a lot of fun.
[270:08.33]These games, well, this one, not so much.
[270:10.37]But 2012 was actually great.
[270:11.89]I had a lot of fun.
[270:13.73]Hope you enjoyed it.
[270:14.31]We'll see you maybe again on Monday.
[270:15.77]Have a great weekend, everybody.
[270:18.65]Let's see if I fixed the credits.
[270:20.07]I tried again today.
[270:22.29]I really did.
[270:24.39]Let's see if it worked.
[270:25.98]Here come all the subs.
[270:26.95]Maybe.
[270:27.35]Hey, I finally got it to work.
[270:30.97]This is not in the right spot.
[270:32.77]And the font is weird.
[270:33.71]Why is the font so weird?
[270:36.25]I'll fix that.
[270:46.88]But thanks everybody for subbing.
[270:49.59]We had some community subs.
[270:50.63]We had a lot.
[270:51.99]50 community subs today from Suck McJones.
[270:55.82]Thank you.
[270:56.12]That's a huge amount of money.
[270:59.34]Do a different font every stream.
[271:08.82]Do I need to teach you how to use OBS?
[271:10.28]No, I'm telling you, I've done this correct every time.
[271:13.70]I didn't change anything.
[271:14.50]Why did it change two months after me streaming?
[271:16.70]It doesn't make any sense.
[271:17.32]I didn't change anything.
[271:18.40]I don't like when things change around me.
[271:23.25]There's no music.
[271:23.81]What the hell am I doing?
[271:27.21]There's still no music.
[271:28.23]Wait, what was that?
[271:29.43]Why was that so loud?
[271:30.67]What was that?
[271:45.47]Um, this is bizarre.
[271:49.21]Why is this right now on my browser's source?
[271:59.02]Wait a minute, this needs to be explored.
[272:00.76]Blog Overwatch?
[272:09.45]Wait, is this a Muzelk video?
[272:16.26]Why is this here?
[272:17.32]I didn't do this.
[272:22.03]I didn't do this.
[272:22.61]I didn't put this here.
[272:23.67]I swear to God, I don't know why this is here.
[272:25.13]Was this like part of a playlist of a video that we watched yesterday?
[272:27.17]It has to be, right?
[272:27.91]I have no idea.
[272:28.59]Well, there's Muselk.
[272:29.39]I don't know why this is here.
[272:58.46]I have no explanation for that.
[272:59.49]I can't even tell you why that may have happened.
[273:02.03]Is this a setup for a joke?
[273:02.95]No.
[273:03.31]I have no idea why that happened.
[273:04.45]I went over to my ending scene and turned my audio on.
[273:08.89]And it was in the middle of a video.
[273:11.71]Probably a second or third or fourth video.
[273:14.55]Or maybe even like a 100th video that just was playing Recommended over and over again all stream.
[273:20.06]I don't know.
[273:20.90]That could have been happening.
[273:25.60]It's very possible that this browser source was just playing videos in the background.
[273:31.87]Whatever.
[273:32.71]Alright, I will see you guys on Monday.
[273:35.17]Who should we raid?
[273:35.75]Let's raid somebody.
[273:37.41]Who's available right now?
[273:39.41]Who's available and what are they doing?
[273:40.81]It's very important.
[273:46.48]Star's playing Hearthstone.
[273:53.33]Yeah, let's go say hi to Star.
[273:54.53]We actually were just talking the other day.
[273:58.43]Great, Star.
[274:02.25]It's very rare that I actually catch him streaming.
[274:04.39]He's probably going to be like mad.
[274:07.28]And I just can't.
[274:09.12]Alright, be nice.
[274:11.80]We're done.
[274:12.52]We're due.
[274:15.76]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[274:16.52]Have a great weekend.
[274:20.55]You were talking about streaming together.
[274:21.72]Yeah, we were talking about these games to play.
[274:27.34]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[274:31.76]Please criticize every move he does in Hearthstone.
[274:37.32]Good night.
[274:38.96]And... Goodbye.
[274:51.99]Thank you.
