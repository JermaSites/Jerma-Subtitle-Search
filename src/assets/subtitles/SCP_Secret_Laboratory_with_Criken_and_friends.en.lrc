[03:36.43]What kind of boy are you?
[03:39.29]Uh, one that uses the bathroom.
[03:42.86]Okay, I'm a T-po- T-pose boy.

[03:48.58]Yeah.
[03:48.94]Are you Peanut?
[03:52.04]I think I'm just a really... I'm the guy that walks through walls.
[03:55.85]Oh, I'm the guy that hugs people.
[03:57.43]I don't know what Peanut does, but I'm just going to sit in the bathroom and scare the shit out of somebody that walks in here.
[04:01.61]Look, they're going to do a bathroom joke, right?
[04:04.75]Yeah.
[04:05.23]I mean, absolutely.
[04:05.73]They're going to come in here and do like a bathroom joke, and I'm going to jump out and scream.
[04:09.81]Absolutely.
[04:11.83]You know, they can't resist a prime bit as a bathroom bit.
[04:15.50]I mean, how could you as like an internet comedian?
[04:18.02]How could you mess up the bathroom joke?
[04:19.74]Oh, let's go in the bathroom.
[04:20.52]I'm going to poop my pants, right?
[04:21.64]And I'll be here.
[04:24.12]Yeah, poop your pants in the bathroom.
[04:28.57]Now, do we get maps as monsters?
[04:30.93]Because let me tell you, I'm fucking lost.
[04:33.63]Every corridor looks the same.
[04:35.03]I have no idea.
[04:39.82]If I wanted... Oh, I found the lifts.
[04:42.46]Okay, but you can't go through those doors.
[04:44.96]Yeah, I think I like my strategy.
[04:46.60]What's your strategy?
[04:47.52]You want to come in the bathroom too?
[04:49.67]Yeah, I'll go in the bathroom.
[04:50.75]You know what would be funny?
[04:51.35]What if we're doing a bathroom bit when they get here, so we're already preemptively doing the joke?
[04:56.86]Oh, they'd be so jealous that we're doing a bit that they thought they had the, you know, first call on, but we already had it.
[05:04.40]Like, we could do, like, a poop your pants joke, you know what I mean?
[05:06.18]Like, while they're gonna come in and do the poop your pants joke, we did it already.
[05:10.35]Yeah.
[05:11.47]Then they're stuck with, like, a pee joke.
[05:12.95]No one fucking likes pee jokes.
[05:14.39]It's so stupid.
[05:14.93]Yeah.
[05:15.03]I mean, you're gonna pee your pants?
[05:17.27]Not funny.
[05:20.77]now if only I could find the bathroom is it like a screen button I can press uh I don't think so it's my bit now so no no yeah so I'm gonna claim it I'm gonna do a little thing here you can come in and do it too but uh I'll make sure to get it locked and loaded you know what I'm saying yep yep lock up your poop oh man I got oh I had a burrito earlier let me go in the bathroom
[05:47.05]I made sure to lock it in for us, so we're good.
[05:49.19]I'm going to be here all game.
[05:50.81]This is the bit, because then now...
[06:15.13]Oh shit, I hear him.

[06:16.38]Okay.
[06:17.40]Physicians.

[06:27.46]No, I'm not.
[06:27.88]Am I?
[06:33.75]Shit.
[06:34.71]No, they're gonna go in the women's bathroom.
[06:35.87]Are you serious?
[06:36.25]That's part of the joke.
[06:46.31]They're all in the corridor.
[06:47.90]Are they coming down here?
[06:49.82]Yeah, they are.
[06:50.42]Okay, you got it.
[06:51.98]I sent a couple of them to timeout zone.

[07:21.24]Can we hear them talking?
[07:22.60]Yeah.
[07:23.18]Yeah, you can hear them talking.
[07:26.06]I'm on the bottom floor.
[07:27.78]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[07:35.45]I'm going to laugh so hard if I actually come down here one day and they're doing a bathroom joke.
[07:39.33]One day.

[29:32.90]Fuck!
[29:33.28]Where'd he go?
[29:34.78]Shit.
[29:35.86]I lost him.
[29:36.34]How did I lose him?
[29:37.08]I got, like, spun around.
[29:38.17]Alright, I gotta get out.
[29:44.63]Where's the exit?
[29:49.52]Found it.
[29:51.40]Exit!
[29:56.87]Like, when it like teleports you and spins you around, I just don't know where the fuck I'm even going.
[30:06.06]Ahhhh.
[30:06.18]I got lost.
[30:09.84]I teleported and got lost.
[30:20.62]The boys are back in town.
[30:23.34]Hey guys.
[30:29.64]I would play with you guys, but you already know I got my RV set up.
[30:33.44]Alright.
[30:36.36]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[30:43.52]What is going on?
[30:44.22]How do you use a gun?
[30:45.55]Where are they getting this gun?
[30:50.78]Where's my gun?
[30:51.84]How do I shoot the gun?
[30:54.04]Oh my god, did I forget to drop the ammo box?
[30:59.83]Oh.
[31:03.17]Oh.
[31:05.97]Well, that's how you can have a gun.
[31:10.69]Come on, this is literally my first time ever playing this fucking game.
[31:14.88]I wouldn't go in one with a body.
[31:17.22]Go in.
[31:17.76]Oh, there's only two.
[31:18.92]It's either this one or that one.
[31:20.20]What's happening?
[31:21.18]I don't understand this.
[31:22.96]Oh, shit.
[31:23.70]Okay.
[31:24.12]You gotta pick one without a body.
[31:27.26]There's only two.
[31:28.06]Five percent!
[31:28.54]Five percent!
[31:29.12]This one!
[31:29.78]It's this one!
[31:30.68]Go!
[31:30.92]It's so not true!
[31:31.98]I fucking hate that character!
[31:35.60]I don't even know what the fuck is going on.
[31:38.41]Oh, my God.
[31:47.11]Hold on, did I just kill everybody because I went that way?
[31:53.35]I have no idea how to even play the game.
[31:56.49]We just loaded in and it was like, go!
[31:58.07]How was that not the exit?
[31:59.59]That was fun.
[32:00.05]That was a fucking great run.
[32:01.17]Every way had a dead body in it.
[32:02.91]Yeah.
[32:06.16]So I let everyone just walk.
[32:10.80]You led like five people to that door.
[32:12.76]I know.
[32:14.34]Death behind me.
[32:15.79]That was honestly one of the most bizarre bottom floors I've ever seen on this map.
[32:19.81]The amount of straight lines.
[32:22.31]It was so weird.
[32:23.93]And the heavy container.
[32:27.01]I'm D-Boy.
[32:28.65]What does that mean?
[32:33.45]I'm D-Boy.
[32:34.53]What's the deal, everybody?
[32:37.45]Alright, so what are we doing here?
[32:39.21]Make sure to check every room for Luke.
[32:41.41]You know what they call me, son?
[32:42.89]You tell them what they call you.
[32:45.78]They call me Capital D. Capital D. That's right, I'm Capital D.
[33:01.59]Where are the guns in this prison?
[33:03.59]Someone singing out there?
[33:05.97]I think so.
[33:06.25]Let's see.
[33:07.13]Watch out for the monsters.
[33:30.03]So are we gonna like lock arms and walk around here?
[33:39.28]Don't you guys know how this works?
[33:45.66]We all have to be facing backwards into each other, so we always have somebody looking out in every direction.
[33:50.29]You know what I mean?
[33:52.55]Like everybody back to back to back, like a giant back to back circle.
[33:57.21]That's not how we do it, Danny.
[33:59.39]So you mean like a bitch then?
[34:02.37]Yeah, that's right.
[34:03.27]Yeah, we want to stay alive.
[34:04.20]You got a bit of a tongue there.
[34:06.36]I'm trying to be alive.
[34:07.28]I'm one of those alive guys.
[34:09.94]Come on.
[34:11.18]I'm going to show you guys where we go when we start a D-block.
[34:15.42]We're going to find a gun, Jax.
[34:17.10]What the fuck is your problem?
[34:20.09]We've got to go.
[34:22.82]If you like to watch, take a seat on the bed, baby.
[34:24.98]Ass to ass.
[34:25.70]You ready to go?
[34:26.56]I'm ready.
[34:27.20]I'm trying... Yeah.
[34:28.46]D4.
[34:28.54]Hang on.
[34:28.98]I'll be right back out, boys.
[34:30.92]Now hold on.
[34:31.44]Hold on.
[34:31.76]Hold on.
[34:32.10]These are all NPCs.
[34:46.41]We're not allowed to see
[35:14.85]I think I'm in voice.
[35:16.51]I'm holding- I'm hitting the right button.
[35:19.25]What happened?
[35:20.23]Is that the mo- How did he die?
[35:21.93]Oh.
[35:42.04]Oh, don't worry.
[35:42.34]It's just the Assassin's Creed guy is here.
[35:44.42]Maybe he'll jump out of a fucking... out of a ledge and lend it to me.
[35:47.86]Hey!
[35:54.40]Um... What happened to my... Guys?
[36:06.55]Guys!
[36:07.79]Guys, there are monsters!
[36:09.49]There's Frankenstein out here!
[36:12.52]Don't be scared.
[36:13.74]It's a private room.
[36:14.96]Hey!
[36:16.04]Yeah, it's not private anymore.
[36:18.46]Come on in.
[36:20.42]Wait.
[36:20.96]Come on.
[36:22.28]Wait.
[36:22.88]Alright, we're good.
[36:25.34]Everyone use... Everyone here is... Everyone's in the cell block because they have super abilities.
[36:32.04]If we use them together, we can defeat them.
[36:34.54]We have super abilities?
[36:35.64]We do.
[36:36.10]Yeah, that's why we're here.
[36:37.38]I can limit things with my mind.
[36:39.04]It's all coming back to me now.
[36:41.24]What power do you have?
[36:42.22]All I have to do is look at my target and say... I don't think his power worked.
[36:50.35]Oh, my God, it didn't work!
[36:51.67]Look, no, he lifted that one's arms a bit higher, a few feet higher.
[36:55.01]Okay, okay, someone else use your power, use your power.
[36:59.00]Alright, I can make my fingertips about 10 degrees hotter than normal.
[37:02.12]Ready?
[37:03.38]Maybe that'll work.
[37:06.60]I think it actually hurt him.
[37:08.61]I think he actually did have power.
[37:09.67]I think that may have worked.
[37:12.19]I can't be beaten in a staring contest.
[37:13.75]I'm winning.
[37:19.13]You're doing a good job.
[37:19.63]Keep it up.
[37:19.91]Keep it up.
[37:20.67]Come on.
[37:23.53]He's losing you.
[37:24.02]He's losing you.
[37:24.42]Good.
[37:24.94]He's backing down.
[37:26.00]Oh, what a power.
[37:26.64]What a power that was.
[37:27.44]Nice work.
[37:32.96]I thought he was going to send the other fella in here.
[37:35.20]Oh, wait.
[37:37.28]Oh, no.
[37:38.56]Oh, no.
[37:39.10]Round two.
[37:39.98]Oh, shit.
[37:40.46]He's better looking than he is.
[37:42.20]God damn it.
[37:44.82]Do you get a power?
[37:46.98]I don't know what it is yet.
[37:48.04]I haven't found it.
[37:49.02]Me either.
[37:51.06]I thought I was going to be able to find my quirk at some point through high school, but it never happened.
[37:56.51]We're both useless.
[37:58.85]I could punch.
[37:59.59]I could throw a punch.
[38:01.01]That's not a power, but it might work.
[38:04.30]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[38:06.24]I feel something.
[38:07.78]I feel something.
[38:08.24]Wait, wait, wait.
[38:08.94]You feel something?
[38:14.48]Here we go.
[38:14.84]I got it.
[38:15.26]I got it.
[38:15.66]I'm going to try.
[38:16.44]The only thing I know how to do.
[38:18.54]This is the only thing I know how to do.
[38:19.84]What do you got?
[38:21.22]I don't know if anybody else can do this, but if I think real hard about a very attractive woman, I can make my penis enlarge a little bit.
[38:27.55]And I'm not sure if anybody else can do that.
[38:28.63]I'm going to try it.
[38:31.87]How does that affect them?
[38:35.42]Oh, uh, I can hurt them.
[38:37.78]If they'll get too close, then it'll scare them.
[38:41.56]Alright, yeah, Courtney Cox.
[38:44.82]She's beautiful.
[38:45.65]Sick.
[38:51.71]I could do a Kermit the Frog impression.
[39:00.75]Kermit, Kermit the Frog.
[39:06.33]Bad joke.
[39:07.25]Like Miss Piggy?
[39:08.35]I have an airplane now.
[39:13.17]Kermit, Kermit the Frog here.
[39:16.30]I don't know, man.
[39:16.92]Really good impression of Kermit the Frog.
[39:20.56]That was a pretty good impression.
[39:21.74]I liked it.
[39:22.64]You get to live.
[39:24.64]He can't hear you.
[39:25.60]He can't hear you.
[39:26.54]Oh.
[39:27.25]Am I okay?
[39:29.19]Oh!
[39:30.87]Miss Piggy?
[39:33.41]I'm just gonna kill him, alright?
[39:35.85]I'm just gonna... I think I'm able to res everyone, but I fucked them up the first couple times.
[39:46.46]Alright.
[39:47.34]There.
[39:47.66]Oh, come!
[39:50.70]Woo!
[39:52.43]How long until the police walk?
[39:54.87]I've been waiting in the elevator for like five minutes.
[39:59.55]I fucked up the res the first like three times because people kept on walking in front of me.
[40:05.88]Put him out of his misery.
[40:11.28]Now we just go upstairs and kill everyone else.
[40:14.20]Oh, get him.
[40:14.76]I just really, really want them to spawn.
[40:18.73]Chip, are you a zombie as well?
[40:20.78]Nah, I'm a fucking sad boy.
[40:22.32]As soon as they open this elevator.
[40:23.34]Have you killed anyone yet?
[40:25.56]Uh, I killed... Who did I kill?
[40:27.96]I killed Chief.
[40:28.88]Chief's dead.
[40:29.24]These T-poses are ruining my immersion.
[40:31.08]And then I freaked bad bananas and someone else out while they were running.
[40:35.23]You guys made that way too easy for me.
[40:36.43]I guess Buck died somehow.
[40:39.83]Okay.
[40:40.59]Well, this round should be over in like 10 seconds once we find them.
[40:43.93]Wherever the fuck they are.
[40:45.77]Don't they spawn again?
[40:47.34]I haven't seen any scientists, so they might still be on this floor, actually.
[40:51.24]So I don't want to leave yet.
[40:52.36]We should, like, split up a little bit.
[40:55.72]See what we can find.
[40:56.58]Yeah, this is the April Fool's version of the game, so.
[41:00.19]Probably some weird shit in here.
[41:02.19]I'll take the way we've been and look for the door.
[41:05.47]Good, good, good.
[41:13.52]How does this be flying around?
[41:20.73]Oh, guys, I found it.
[41:22.07]I found the way up.
[41:24.01]I got him.
[41:24.97]Ah, the rest are that way.
[41:26.25]Try not to kill them at the rest of them.
[41:28.49]Oh, actually, they're coming to the elevator.
[41:32.49]Ooh.
[41:33.01]I'm just running after them.
[41:33.91]I don't even know.
[41:34.51]I'm just scared.
[41:35.27]Delicious.
[41:35.79]Where you come from, brother?
[41:37.93]You jumped right into my house.
[41:41.06]I ran into my room.
[41:44.14]Don't look back.
[41:45.40]Don't look back.
[41:47.05]Open!
[41:47.27]It's flying all over my board right now.
[41:49.68]I hear the gunshots.
[41:51.06]Oh no!
[41:53.46]Lift him!
[41:54.46]He's a nerd?
[41:56.88]Nerd.
[41:58.10]Wait, where are you guys?
[41:59.14]Upstairs?
[42:00.46]I'm at lift B. I'm going up now.
[42:03.19]Okay, James, are you fighting someone?
[42:05.55]Yeah, there's someone down here.
[42:07.41]Yeah, we're just chasing people around.
[42:10.43]If it's both of you just chasing him, just get him.
[42:13.38]I feel so bad.
[42:14.12]I just only killed Asher on accident.
[42:16.33]He duped us.
[42:17.37]He did.
[42:18.13]He just totally played us.
[42:20.29]Come out!
[42:23.77]T-Pose Tuesday.
[42:26.94]Oh well.
[42:27.38]Come in.
[42:27.64]Alright, I'm at the lift.
[42:31.34]Lift A.
[42:37.24]Sweet.
[42:37.70]I found the way out, out, uh, upstairs.
[42:41.78]If you come up the lift, I might be able to come get you.
[42:44.90]Okay.
[42:45.82]Maybe make sure to check for the bathroom joke.
[42:48.02]No?
[42:48.56]Anybody in there?
[42:49.77]No?
[42:53.33]Uh, ooh, someone's been through this way.
[42:55.73]Tomato!
[42:58.67]Dave, I took a different lift than you, so we're probably not that close.
[43:03.21]Oh, you're right.
[43:05.27]Anybody?
[43:05.61]I'm just going in circles now.
[43:07.57]I wonder if I can deactivate the warheads.
[43:13.18]Do you need the keycard for that one?
[43:15.34]I don't think so.
[43:16.40]I'm turning it on.
[43:17.48]I'm just deactivating it.
[43:18.72]I might not.
[43:19.22]I was the only one with a level 5 keycard.
[43:22.88]You killed me, so I don't know.
[43:26.50]Ben, I wouldn't have killed you if you didn't jump actually into my character.
[43:30.89]Can I press the button?
[43:32.99]Alright, I guess I'm going up.
[43:36.82]There's people coming down.
[43:37.98]Oh.
[43:38.70]There's only one, actually.
[43:41.58]He's alone.
[43:42.18]And he's running.
[43:42.74]Oh, what the fuck?
[43:44.91]I... Alright.
[43:45.51]What happened to me?
[44:03.77]I got shocked.
[44:05.69]Do we have a shock trap?
[44:09.69]It's here.
[44:10.21]It's here.
[44:10.83]What happened?
[44:11.81]Keep going.
[44:12.45]I don't understand what I did.
[44:22.68]I've ran into the electric wall.
[44:23.36]I'll make it out for you, Boone.
[44:25.66]I'll go, Boone.
[44:26.34]I'm sorry.
[44:26.62]Is this Ren and Stimpy?
[44:29.74]Tesla gates.
[44:30.48]Oh, whatever.
[44:39.90]This is what I just did.
[44:40.74]See?
[44:41.30]He did the same- Oh, yeah.
[44:45.08]I thought he was gonna do the same thing.
[44:47.66]I didn't even know that was a possibility.
[44:50.08]I didn't know that that was happening.
[44:53.40]It's the first time I've been up here.
[44:56.67]What's he doing?
[45:02.59]Does he get a gun now?
[45:05.99]Ooh.
[45:10.62]What the fuck is that thing?
[45:12.46]That was a giant pelican person.
[45:16.90]That was a bald pelican.
[45:21.15]Good thing he was contained.
[45:41.50]Good try.
[45:42.70]He says you gotta get past the electrical and then I walk right into it and die.
[45:46.28]I did the same thing.
[45:47.86]I literally just did the same thing.
[45:52.86]See?
[45:54.13]We're all walking to electricity and shit.
[46:00.87]That's the SCP that hunts you down if you see a photo of it.
[46:03.25]That's insane.
[46:03.77]SCP.
[46:08.24]SCP.
[46:21.77]So, have you guys seen A Quiet Place?
[46:29.02]You liked it?
[46:30.26]A lot of SCP is insane, creepy, but yeah.
[46:33.06]It's four or five years ago when I played some of those games on stream.
[46:38.02]Not on stream, on video.
[46:41.69]It's a very dedicated user base.
[46:46.01]What happened to him?
[46:46.69]Oh.
[46:48.29]His head exploded.
[46:55.20]Yeah, this is April Fool's mode.
[46:56.48]This is like a jokey mode.
[46:57.52]This ain't the real thing.
[47:00.36]This is probably going to be my last one.
[47:08.61]I'm probably going to take off after this.
[47:10.39]I'm going to get some sleep tonight.
[47:13.67]I'm a bird.
[47:15.17]I will explain.
[47:16.89]What?
[47:20.79]I've got a Wheatley pop.
[47:22.49]This is a rare one.
[47:23.37]You can only get this at Hot Topic for two weeks.
[47:49.31]Space, right?
[47:50.17]Haha, space.
[47:51.11]Remember that?
[47:52.15]This is Cockdog 69 to Thunder 6.
[47:54.89]Do you read?
[47:55.63]Over.
[47:55.83]They don't have any spare batteries.
[48:00.20]This is Cockdog.
[48:02.68]Welcome to the elevator.
[48:04.70]What the fuck?
[48:05.56]I'm gonna throw up.
[48:07.58]Get out of there.
[48:08.04]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[48:09.90]Welcome to the elevator.
[48:11.36]Which way would you like to go?
[48:16.04]Hey, get out.
[48:19.14]Let's Wheatley these motherfuckers.
[48:21.07]Oh, it bounced off the wall.
[48:26.98]Shit!
[48:27.76]Did we get him?
[48:28.54]We got one!
[48:29.46]How do we get out of here?
[48:34.01]Did you just close this out?
[48:35.67]Let's try that again.
[48:37.29]He's still alive.
[48:38.17]He's still fine.
[48:38.77]You guys all in the same hotel room?
[48:40.85]Damn!
[48:53.20]Sorry.
[48:53.60]Please enter or exit the elevator.
[48:57.84]Okay.
[48:59.12]Where would you like to go?
[49:00.60]Floor five, please.
[49:02.20]I got a presidential suite, you know.
[49:05.86]What?
[49:06.96]What the hell's going on?
[49:11.13]Have a good day.
[49:15.79]What?
[49:26.13]They turn the music on and then you die and you come out why am I not Why are we getting oh god there's so few of you with this guy I
[49:58.48]I can't tell what music is in the game and what music is being played through a mic.
[50:09.43]The elevator SCP.
[50:12.21]No, no!
[50:14.15]No!
[50:14.51]No!
[50:15.39]Stop!
[50:17.63]Stop!
[50:18.47]I might have been able to-
[50:24.72]Dude!
[50:26.48]Dude!
[50:30.78]Dude!
[50:33.44]Yeah, fat chance, fat chance.
[50:36.00]Only four people, five people alive.
[50:44.01]Watch out for the airplanes.
[50:45.09]Watch out for the airplanes.
[50:47.07]What happened?
[50:48.27]He walked into an electrical wall.
[50:51.61]Yeah, and then, I mean, then I got killed.
[50:54.07]We can buy them together.
[50:58.27]Hey, gang.
[50:59.09]How's it going?
[51:00.33]Nerf that.
[51:00.71]Hey, gang.
[51:05.44]It's just a classic 2v2 deathmatch right now.
[51:08.60]This is esports now.
[51:09.98]Yeah, he's got a rifle.
[51:10.88]He's got a club.
[51:11.58]Classic, yeah.
[51:13.24]Yeah, they have the advantage.
[51:17.33]Die!
[51:17.47]Good, good.
[51:17.95]One more, one more.
[51:18.75]Can he clutch it?
[51:20.79]He has 8 HP clutch.
[51:22.41]Nice.
[51:24.93]That was a close one.
[51:27.25]Wait, they won?
[51:28.39]Blue team pulls it off again.
[51:29.71]Never seen that win.
[51:31.60]And starting another round here as the blue team takes a victory.
[51:35.18]Close battle.
[51:40.28]Alright.
[51:41.41]I'm going to head out.
[51:45.00]Let me do this.
[51:46.50]That was an excellent play by the blue team against red team Alpha 4 Drama.
[51:57.23]And I've got to run.
[51:59.47]It was real.
[52:00.17]It was fun.
[52:01.17]Thanks for the invite, guys.
[52:03.65]Thanks for hanging out.
[52:05.17]Thanks for coming by.
[52:08.05]I will catch you guys probably soon.
[52:09.53]Hit me up.
[52:12.27]See you, Jeremy.
[52:12.91]They always do.
[52:15.22]Made it.
[52:16.54]Bye-bye.
[52:17.08]Bye.
[52:17.84]Disconnect.
[52:18.32]Hey, yes, okay.
[52:24.59]So I'm gonna head out for the night.
[52:29.77]I have to be... No stream tomorrow or Friday.
[52:32.93]We're gonna pick up on the weekend a couple of times.
[52:36.08]So the next stream you'll probably see will be Sunday.
[52:39.72]Probably Sunday night.
[52:41.99]If you don't know, just want to make sure you guys understand why there's no streams tomorrow.
[52:45.81]The next day, if you weren't here when we talked about it, I was in the chat briefly.
[52:50.37]I have a wake and a funeral to go to over the next couple of days.
[52:54.04]So I won't be around.
[52:58.64]I will see you guys on Sunday, probably.
[53:02.34]Sorry for the erratic kind of stream again.
[53:05.51]Dropped a bunch of frames halfway through.

[53:48.29]And with that, let me go to the credits.
[53:55.55]Let's roll them, what do you say?
[54:01.12]Yeah.
[54:02.68]Yeah, I know.
[54:08.30]You always come back right at the end.
[54:10.85]Yeah, it's like three and a half hours or so.
[54:12.98]I wanted to try to go for about four, but I thought we were going to get a little bit more material out of Sub Rosa, but I feel like that game is kind of... It's... If you've done it two or three times, you've done it all.
[54:26.33]It has some good RP capabilities, but you know, it's still fun nonetheless.
[54:36.21]And let's roll the credits!
[54:37.63]So thank you everybody for subbing and resubbing
[54:41.24]Much appreciated.

[57:12.45]The bits.
[57:13.17]Here they come.
[57:17.87]Turn this down a little bit.
[57:20.93]And let's take a look.
[57:23.21]So we have recent events.
[57:27.11]Here we are.
[57:29.65]Why is that so hard?
[57:31.61]It's not.
[57:32.39]Sometimes I just get caught up, you know?
[57:33.83]Sometimes I get caught up.
[57:36.13]Let's start back here with Bitslave.
[57:38.65]Thanks for the $1.
[57:41.09]Hey, my lead.
[57:41.81]Sorry about yesterday.
[57:42.63]I had to use your bandwidth to pirate some bits.
[57:45.10]Hope it didn't cause too much trouble.
[57:46.82]Well, you did.
[57:48.10]You killed the stream.
[57:50.38]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[57:51.58]Hello, handsome boy.
[57:52.54]Are you going to play Far Cry 1 someday?
[57:54.22]Yes.
[57:55.30]Absolutely.
[57:57.56]It is on the radar for sure.
[58:00.22]BitSlave, again, thanks for the $0.25.
[58:01.96]Also, I jumped in front of a moving car on a dark intersection to sue the guy.
[58:06.31]Settlement brought in big bits.
[58:09.35]Good.
[58:10.81]Good.
[58:13.91]Quicker do the bits before your internet cuts out.
[58:16.85]Oh, fuck.
[58:17.41]It really is happening, isn't it?
[58:21.14]God damn it.
[58:22.70]Oh, well.
[58:24.64]Yeah, I gotta get to the bottom of this.
[58:25.91]I gotta... I have to prioritize moving, I think, faster than I thought I was gonna have to.
[58:35.77]But, thank you.
[58:37.47]Thank you for your patience.
[58:38.51]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer, for the 25 cents.
[58:41.01]Welcome back, Jerma.
[58:42.41]Garfield and friends missed you in your absence.
[58:44.63]Hope you enjoyed your vacation away from Garfield the Paragraph Writer.
[58:48.12]Would you believe me if I told you that it takes me over an hour to write every bit donation?
[58:51.56]Believe it or not, that isn't a joke.
[58:53.90]I have a writing room of writers who help me out, despite working in the funny papers for three decades.
[58:58.36]I still haven't grasped the concept of writing yet.
[59:00.68]Then again, I'm a cat.
[59:01.44]A cat with a creepy human hand.
[59:05.03]Thank you.
[59:05.87]Thank you, Akarama, for the 34 bits.
[59:08.11]Don't fuck with the Goldmans.
[59:11.28]You really shouldn't.
[59:12.64]It's bad news written all over it.
[59:16.28]Fred Flintstone thanks for the $1.
[59:18.06]Meat at Sneeds.
[59:20.55]Feed and Seed.
[59:23.25]Whatever that is.
[59:26.24]Uh, Bayden, Baydenintromy, thanks for the 25 cents.
[59:30.16]Hey, Jeremy, I love your streams, but sadly, I'm a VOD boy.
[59:32.52]I give you enough bits to buy a gumball.
[59:34.12]Do you like gumballs?
[59:35.02]By the way, you are funny.
[59:37.60]I do?
[59:39.52]Actually, I'm gonna use your 25 cents.
[59:43.29]Thanks, let me see the gumball machine.
[59:45.25]Quarters going in it.
[59:46.85]I'm gonna turn my mouth blue.
[59:50.21]Garfield the Monday Killer, again here, thank you for the 25 cents.
[59:53.25]My first video game console was the PlayStation 2.
[59:56.20]I was overjoyed when you said you'd be playing it, especially Monster Rancher.
[59:59.68]Have you ever heard of Ape Escape 3?
[60:02.42]Other than the camera being a little wonky, I think it makes it for humor, aesthetic, and combo controls.
[60:08.64]It's about chasing around Muppet-looking monkeys, all of them with different costume abilities.
[60:13.19]And every level is based on a movie or genre.
[60:15.65]Also, people in chat are shipping us.
[60:17.09]Huh, why did I rate that?
[60:19.43]Thanks.
[60:20.31]Sunflower Galaxy, thanks for the 50 cents.
[60:21.95]What kind of Uber is this?
[60:23.91]A dangerous one that you would rate one star.
[60:27.64]Damscaster, thanks for the $15.
[60:29.70]Appreciate it.
[60:31.82]Jerma, we love you so much.
[60:33.42]And thanks for being such an awesome streamer.
[60:34.88]Personally, I've been watching a long time.
[60:37.65]And your content has been so helpful to me in my life.
[60:39.55]I aspire to be as great and funny as you are one day.
[60:46.97]That's... Thank you for saying that.
[60:49.15]I am humbled into oblivion to hear somebody say that.
[60:55.81]I wish you luck.
[60:58.45]on your aspirations, whatever they are.
[61:02.89]Thank you so much for the $15, dude.
[61:06.40]Smellyboy11, thanks for the $1.
[61:07.86]Say PP, just did.
[61:11.14]Uh, Silverflame, thank you for the 30 bits.
[61:13.78]Hey, Jerma, I discovered your videos during a really bad time in my life and they helped me smile when I needed to.
[61:22.14]Recently, life has been really rough, but I can always turn to you when I need to smile.
[61:26.32]Thanks, bro.
[61:26.83]Keep up the good work.
[61:28.69]Thank you, Silverflame.
[61:31.19]Appreciate it, dude.
[61:34.33]Um, happy to be somebody you can look up to.
[61:37.77]He just, what do you mean he just told me?
[61:46.53]No, he didn't tell me.
[61:49.63]They didn't tell me.
[61:52.49]Yeah, it says... But that could be anything.
[61:54.15]You could be great and funny anywhere.
[61:55.13]It doesn't have to be, you know... It doesn't have to be in a particular career.
[62:20.31]Thank you.
[62:22.15]Thank you, Silverflame, though.
[62:23.29]Much love to you.
[62:24.75]The coldest fridge, thanks for the $1.
[62:26.11]Well, Jerma, I made it despite your direction.
[62:28.92]Superintendent Fridge, welcome.
[62:31.18]Hope you prepared for an unforgettable luncheon.
[62:33.38]Yeah, oh, gasp.
[62:34.46]Oh, you gads, my roast is ruined by rats.
[62:37.08]But what if I were to purchase cheeseburgers and disguise them as my own cooking?
[62:40.75]Oh, ho, ho, ho, delightfully devilish.
[62:45.97]Okay, alright.
[62:47.23]Thanks, dude.
[62:47.69]Thanks, Coldest Fridge.
[62:48.45]Again, for the $1.
[62:49.27]Fridge walks in.
[62:50.09]Superintendent, I was just stretching my calves on the windowsill.
[62:53.33]Isometric supersize.
[62:54.45]Care to join me?
[62:55.65]Why is there smoke?
[62:56.77]This is the principal Simpson joke.
[63:01.19]Thanks, Coldest Fridge.
[63:02.11]There's $5 here that has the whole thing.
[63:07.20]That's what I call cheeseburgers.
[63:08.16]You call cheeseburgers steamed hams.
[63:09.40]That's a regional dialect.
[63:10.78]What region?
[63:11.50]Upstate Massachusetts.
[63:12.58]Really?
[63:12.90]Well, I'm from Boston.
[63:15.26]Thank you, Coldest Fridge, for the entire video.
[63:20.42]And your $5.
[63:23.17]$6, actually.
[63:23.69]Like, $7 here.
[63:26.97]Thank you.
[63:29.93]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $1.
[63:31.07]Haha, vacuum joke.

[64:06.12]Uh, Kairotobi, uh, did $250.
[64:12.76]Quarter of a thousand dollars from Kairotobi right now.
[64:17.60]That was, um, that's, that's fucking insane.
[64:23.56]Hey Jerma, tonight's stream was an absurd Tarantino fever dream, which was great.
[64:27.08]Also, it's time to move.
[64:28.72]Yes, I agree.
[64:32.05]Thank you for your 250 fucking dollars.
[64:38.75]Holy shit, man.
[64:41.71]Um, yeah.

[68:22.95]SCP-985 is currently considered contained and of no real threat.

[70:54.51]The detective stream has to happen here.
[70:56.52]I want that to be on a weekend or on Friday.
[70:59.04]Because that's, I feel like, the most amount of fun we can have on a Friday night.
[71:03.48]But... I don't know.
[71:06.26]Maybe Tuesday?
[71:08.32]I don't think I want to do it on Tuesday, though.

[71:12.27]We'll see.
[71:12.77]It'll be soon, though.

[71:43.92]But that means a lot.

[72:05.30]Thanks for not banning me.
[72:07.26]Yeah, thanks for not banning me when I played like a full three minutes of Gremlins 2 last night.
[72:16.08]You'll go to TwitchCon?
[72:16.82]Let's do it.
[72:17.22]Yeah, do it.

[72:45.86]Firstly, my condolences.
[72:46.96]Secondly, thank you for the quality streams.
[72:48.98]They've got me through these past couple of months.
[72:51.07]Your Monster Rancher 2 streams actually got me into playing it again.
[72:55.15]It's a good wave of nostalgia.
[72:57.21]Thank you, Booty.
[72:58.97]Appreciate that.
[73:00.81]And yeah, Monster Rancher 2 is a fantastic game.
[73:04.73]It's... It's one of those overlooked gems, I think.
[73:11.17]That nobody, I mean, I really wish they would do another one, but it's kind of hard at this point.
[73:16.83]Maybe.
[73:17.06]But thanks, man.
[73:19.38]Thank you to Clueless Sniper for the five dollars.
[73:21.20]Hey, dude, it was great meeting you at PAX last Thursday.
[73:24.52]You're so much taller and handsome in person.
[73:26.88]I just wanted to say thanks for signing my Christmas card.
[73:29.80]I have it framed on my wall now.
[73:31.94]Going to PAX turned me into a nervous wreck, but I'm glad I made the trip to see you.
[73:39.38]I'm more than happy to sign your Christmas card.
[73:42.46]Thanks for coming out to the meetup, man.
[73:46.34]There were a lot of people over those couple days.
[73:48.29]I was surprised.

[74:10.14]Hey Jerma, I just beat Dark Souls.
[74:11.52]I went to play the DLC and I'm stuck on the first boss.
[74:13.98]It's hard but awesome.
[74:15.66]I didn't expect there to be a cutscene.
[74:19.30]And then I was one shot.
[74:20.42]Anyways, I love the game so far.
[74:24.32]How much DLC is in Dark Souls 1?
[74:26.76]Accuse whoever that was.
[74:31.83]Remember that guy's name.
[74:36.62]Yeah, jot down that username.
[74:38.68]It could be me.
[74:40.38]Any of these people could be me.
[74:42.50]I could be faking half of these donations, and you don't even know.
[74:47.86]I could be, I literally, I could be typing one DLC right now.
[74:53.91]Can you prove that?
[74:56.07]Good luck.
[74:59.22]one tall DLC yeah I'll be I'm gonna be playing when once it comes out on the remastered version whatever console or if it's pc I'll try and play through it see I could even be Twitch staff but thanks a lot man thank you fred flintstone for the one dollar for the Vegas fun thank you that's going right into the Betty white machine uh bit slave thanks for the 25 cents contrary to garfield the Monday killer it takes me less than a minute to write my bits but it's a nine to five job to steal them
[75:32.17]That was good.
[75:33.07]Lightning Rider, thanks for the $1.
[75:34.57]I meant Bloodborne, not Dark Souls.
[75:36.39]Oh, well, that's even... Bloodborne's, like, one of my favorite games ever.
[75:40.03]First... Oh, yeah, that first DLC boss?
[75:43.11]Sayonara.
[75:45.83]The first DLC boss is the best boss they've ever done in any Souls game, so... He is awesome.
[75:53.10]No spoilers, not gonna say who it is, but... Thank you, Lightning Rider.
[75:58.86]Appreciate it.
[76:02.02]Uh Saturns, thank you Saturn Z for the $15.
[76:05.50]Appreciate you Jerma.
[76:06.44]Hope things work out for you soon Thank you Um, I'm really looking forward to trying to live on the west coast Something about being out there interests me especially considering that uh, okay real talk time to be real Pull it back real
[76:28.02]Trying to do video production stuff out here is nearly impossible.
[76:34.95]Being in New England is like just absolutely terrible for finding places to film, spaces to lease out, people to get involved.
[76:45.64]It's terrible.
[76:47.74]Being able to be like 30 to 40 minutes from Los Angeles and even in Vegas too.
[76:54.46]Vegas has a lot going on there.
[76:58.96]I just need to change the scenery.
[77:01.29]I have to try.
[77:01.79]I've only had a few really, really good thumbs up experiences trying to find places to film around Boston.
[77:12.65]It's not that easy.
[77:14.69]It's not the place to do it.
[77:18.82]But being out on the West Coast, it's obviously a huge part of the culture out there, especially in the Los Angeles area.
[77:25.52]And living in a place like Vegas, it's, like I said, it's a 40-minute plane ride to Los Angeles.
[77:36.23]East is the best, East Coast, best coast.
[77:37.97]I love the East Coast.
[77:39.05]I love Massachusetts.
[77:44.34]I grew up here.
[77:45.80]I've lived here my whole life.
[77:48.72]Of course I love the East Coast.
[77:51.84]But for the sake of continuing to do the things that I want to do, I can't be here anymore.
[77:57.41]I have to try going the other side of the country.
[78:00.67]But that's it.
[78:01.23]That's pretty much the real talk.
[78:05.59]He thinks it'll take 40 minutes to get to LA from Las Vegas?
[78:08.45]Yeah, that's like a 45 minute plane ride.
[78:14.49]But, yeah, that's pretty much it.
[78:18.34]The coldest fridge thanks for the 95 cents Jerma, please read the whole thing.
[78:22.34]It took me so long to type out Look I'll do you a solid here.
[78:31.54]Okay.

[83:15.71]Garfield, the Monday Killer, uh, thank you.
[83:17.43]It's funny, there's an audible sigh of irritation whenever Jerma runs through my bits slightly faster as he goes through them in the most monotone voice possible.
[83:25.78]Then when he hears a compliment, his voice brightens up at least 15%.
[83:29.28]Just joking.
[83:30.76]It's a funny relationship, J and Garf has.
[83:33.66]Love you regardless of you hating me in my comics.
[83:36.15]Garfield, wink.
[83:37.07]Thank you, Garfield.

[83:49.90]I'm still struggling a bit, but with stress, trying to finish this god-awful semester, but at least I have you to lighten my mood and make my day.
[83:57.70]Thank you.
[83:59.54]No problem at all, Nightfang.

[84:24.02]Spencer isn't going to ban me for murdering people for bits, is he?
[84:26.74]That's not on me.
[84:27.48]That's on you.
[84:29.37]UpwardFern, thanks for the $2.45.
[84:32.33]Hey, can you play more games like Harvester 2?
[84:34.73]That was so entertaining to watch.
[84:36.43]And I want you to know you help me when I'm down.
[84:39.29]And I love the streams.
[84:39.97]I'm sorry for your loss.
[84:40.91]Thanks.
[84:44.04]Thank you.
[84:45.02]Appreciate that.
[84:48.09]It was a very close friend's family member.
[84:50.97]So somebody that I've known for a very long time.
[84:54.45]So it sucks, but, you know, there's not much to say, you know, it's just, it's, it just sucks.
[85:08.97]But thank you.
[85:09.43]Appreciate it.
[85:10.23]Thank you, MooMeansMoo, for the $1.
[85:12.22]I promise this is the only bits I'll be giving for a while.
[85:14.44]I'm cutting myself off.
[85:15.60]Alright, good.
[85:16.78]But I just wanted to say thank you for this amazing stream.
[85:18.86]Even though I didn't get any of the work I needed to get done, done.
[85:23.04]But thank you for making me laugh until it hurts.
[85:25.75]When my coursework makes me want to be Ted.
[85:29.95]Take it slow.
[85:30.85]Take it easy.
[85:32.89]Can be a pain in the ass, but thank you for the $1.
[85:35.63]And I won't be seeing you giving money for a long time.
[85:39.04]Good.
[85:40.88]Thank you, dude.
[85:42.22]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[85:43.72]I'm Jerma.
[85:44.62]Make sure to accuse that person first, because it ain't me.
[85:47.83]Broluck, again, thanks for the $1.
[85:49.17]Me, Jerma, is actually Garfield and BitSlave.
[85:51.33]I think the joke is running a bit far here, so to make it fair, I'll give that away now.
[85:55.89]Good luck.
[85:57.91]And then a few more.
[85:58.81]BitSlave, thanks for the $1.50.
[86:00.46]Holy shit, I almost died to get these.
[86:03.48]Fuck, don't rob a gun store.
[86:06.04]Don't rob any stores!
[86:08.93]Don't do any robbery.
[86:11.67]Only work that you get paid for that is completely legal.
[86:16.89]Thank you.
[86:18.53]Sprite37, thanks for the $5.
[86:20.01]Here's more to add to your Vegas fund, Jerma.
[86:21.71]As someone who used to live in Vegas, it's a bit harsh with the community there, but I hope it's kinder to you than it was to me.
[86:28.87]All the luck and good vibes.
[86:29.89]Thank you.
[86:31.73]Yeah, well, here's the thing.
[86:34.01]I'm not necessarily going out to Vegas to...
[86:39.45]Jump into any particular scene in Vegas.
[86:43.00]I mean, gambling in the Strip is cool, but that's not really why I'm going out there.
[86:48.50]I'm going out there because Nevada is really, really cheap.
[86:52.82]And it's really, really stable in regards to expenses.
[87:00.10]So I'm going out to the West Coast more so not to go, you know, like yuck it up in Vegas, you know what I mean?
[87:06.65]Although I probably will a few times.
[87:08.73]Only a few times a year.
[87:10.39]Maybe like three times a year.
[87:13.90]With a zero added.
[87:15.74]One month a year is what I'll give myself to go yuck it up in Vegas.
[87:18.46]You know, two months a year.
[87:19.92]60 days.
[87:20.56]That's it.
[87:22.58]But thank you.
[87:24.06]Thank you, Sprite.
[87:24.60]Thank you also to Bitslave again for the 25 cents.
[87:26.30]Come to Saint.
[87:29.52]Um...
[87:32.98]I'm not going to say that name.
[87:34.72]I'm going to be a saint.
[87:38.12]I don't want to say the name of a town and a state.
[87:43.41]I am a saint.
[87:45.67]That's how I am.
[87:46.83]I can set you up with a house to squad and then we can have ice cream and pizza while sitting by the fort.
[87:53.41]I don't know what you mean, but I don't want to say places and things.
[88:00.79]Mostly lost thanks for the 10 bucks here.
[88:02.51]Here's some extra bits for accidentally putting my B-movie script through the text-to-speech.
[88:06.49]Like, that's what it costs?
[88:07.53]10 bucks?
[88:09.43]Thanks, dude.
[88:10.57]Appreciate it, man.
[88:13.24]Jose, thank you, Jose, last name for the $1.
[88:15.56]Hey, Jerma, today was a bit shit.
[88:17.82]Just broke up from a year and a half relationship, but the stream gave me something to distract myself.
[88:22.22]Thank you so much, Jerma.
[88:23.28]Love you.
[88:24.72]Really sorry to hear that.
[88:26.90]Once you cross the year plus relationship status, that can be hard to do.
[88:34.15]So I'm really sorry to hear that, man.
[88:37.35]I wish you the best of luck in the future.
[88:40.13]But thank you for sticking around.
[88:43.42]It was a lot of fun.
[88:44.90]And thanks for the $1 as well.
[88:47.62]Last few here.
[88:48.20]Thank you to Floytron for the $1.
[88:49.66]I've been watching your old TF2 videos lately.
[88:51.62]You make me happy when I feel down for that.
[88:53.21]I thank you.
[88:54.74]Well, thank you for giving me money while you're watching my stream.
[88:59.46]Thanks, man.
[89:03.30]I love all those old videos.
[89:04.42]Those old videos are a part of me, you know what I mean?
[89:07.86]You know when you go and you play Zelda and you get the eight heart pieces and it gives you another heart slot?
[89:13.46]Those old TF2 videos are at least like one or two of those pieces.
[89:17.47]You gotta go around and find those in different temples in my body.
[89:22.66]Thank you.
[89:23.98]Also, Maisie Kit, thanks for the $1.
[89:25.74]I didn't find your YouTube channel until way after one of the hardest points in my life, but you're helping nonetheless.
[89:31.82]I look forward to seeing you at some future TwitchCon.
[89:33.92]I will be at this year's TwitchCon probably, so hopefully I see you there.
[89:39.61]I'm sure I'll do a meetup or a meet and greet or something, and we will exchange words.
[89:44.97]Thank you, Maisie.
[89:47.11]Toasty Yoshi, thanks for the 26 cents.
[89:48.71]Hello, Germany, your biggest 14-year-old fan here.
[89:51.54]I love your streams.
[89:55.00]Well, make sure you stay in school.
[89:59.20]Make sure you study.
[90:01.28]Make sure you eat right.
[90:03.44]Remember, yogurt a couple times a week is alright.
[90:07.70]Get an A on that math test.
[90:09.44]I know you're studying for.
[90:13.36]Thank you, though.
[90:13.78]Thank you, Toasty.
[90:14.36]Thank you, Dedo.
[90:15.56]Dedo.
[90:17.86]That's how I'm always going to call you, man.
[90:20.20]Thank you, Detto, for the $5.
[90:23.28]Kim wants to know if you want shrimp ravioli.
[90:26.38]Yeah, that sounds fucking pretty good.
[90:29.07]BitSlave, thanks for the 25 cents.
[90:30.41]It's hard to get a job as a convicted felon, Jeremiah.
[90:32.25]How am I supposed to get you bits?
[90:35.09]You could just not.
[90:36.85]You could just not give bits to this channel.
[90:39.77]You know?
[90:40.93]I could just say, you are relieved from your work of getting me bits.
[90:46.31]You don't have to do it.
[90:50.77]And with that, I will see you guys probably Sunday.
[90:56.61]And now we're going to have...
[91:00.97]uh this next week is going to be open so had some busy stuff going on the last like couple of weeks two three weeks in a row now pax is done um obviously have a few things going on this week that I have to um be a part of and then next week here is the detective stream will probably happen on Friday we'll go back to maybe Monster Rancher there's a lot of shit that's going on this coming week here so

[91:29.93]Thanks for sticking around.
[91:31.55]Also, that was Kryken and friends and UberHacksOnova that we were playing with tonight.
[91:37.63]Go give them a follow or whatever you do.
[91:40.07]You know, whatever you guys do.
[91:42.71]And I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[91:45.07]And mostly lost right at the buzzer.
[91:46.35]You thought the stream was ending?
[91:47.63]Ooh, yeah, it is.
[91:50.48]Take care, guys.
[91:54.21]Well, that was really abruptly loud.
[91:55.93]Sorry.
