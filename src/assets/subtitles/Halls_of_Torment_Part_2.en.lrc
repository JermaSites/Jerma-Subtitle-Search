[00:21.93]Hey, what's up?
[00:23.48]Yeah, I know I'm late.
[00:24.44]Yeah, it's not really.
[00:25.66]Not really.
[00:33.88]Well, I was going to stream yesterday, but moved it to today.
[00:37.08]It was going to be 6 o'clock at night, but reverse delayed after a delay to noon.
[00:45.33]So you got both a delay and a reverse delay.
[00:49.81]You're my favorite E-clown.
[00:52.67]I appreciate that.
[00:56.67]We should all play Valorant so I play it.
[01:03.79]A lot of people already play Valorant and I don't play it.
[01:10.66]I'm definitely not going to play Valorant.
[01:13.22]I'm telling you right now.
[01:17.21]Any shooter game that requires a ton of brain power to learn.
[01:24.81]Is Valorant a high brain power game?
[01:27.13]Or no?
[01:27.71]People are going to laugh at me for saying that, aren't they?
[01:32.14]Am I going to get laughed at for saying that?
[01:37.06]No?
[01:38.02]I mean, it feels like a kind of a high brain power game.
[01:41.45]He played TF2.
[01:45.14]I just told you a story a few days ago about how I AFK'd and spawned with the flog and ate chocolate until I fell asleep.
[01:54.71]I don't think you can do that in Valorant.
[01:58.69]So... I'm not so sure if some of these shooter games are for me.
[02:05.72]But anyways, hello.
[02:09.50]We're going to play more Halls of Torment today.
[02:11.40]It's going to be a very short stream.
[02:14.90]I have to prepare.
[02:15.64]A Ster is coming to Vegas.
[02:21.34]So I'm going to spend some time.
[02:23.81]It'll be really interesting.
[02:24.87]It's been a while since me and Ster have spent some time hanging out.
[02:32.76]How short?
[02:33.22]Probably like two or three hours.
[02:34.18]That's very short, but hey, let's hang out.
[02:39.05]I also plan on opening some crates in Team Fortress today.
[02:43.35]I have a whole backpack full of keys and shit.
[02:45.23]I'm just like, do I?
[02:46.11]How do I?
[02:46.41]What do I even do about this?
[02:48.91]So you're going to get a Halls of Torment, one or two Halls of Torment runs, and then a TF2 box opening stream.
[02:58.90]Welcome.
[02:59.64]Welcome to the new Jerma.
[03:02.39]Oh, boy, he's going to just open crates for an hour and leave.
[03:06.13]Oh, oh, oh.
[03:07.92]Oh, this is this is the end.
[03:10.48]This is the we're at the end.
[03:16.92]No, no, it's I just I have a lot of cases that are old.
[03:20.34]I've got like winter, like 2000, like 20, like 2019, I think crates.
[03:27.92]I don't even know what's in them.
[03:31.45]I've got... I don't know.
[03:33.03]I got 25 keys.
[03:34.15]When are you going to play Viewfinder?
[03:37.33]Yeah.
[03:39.85]Winter Cases!
[03:40.71]Oh, mega lull.
[03:41.57]Don't open?
[03:42.07]Are they bad?
[03:45.07]Should I not have gotten the Winter Cases?
[03:47.87]Well, I didn't get any.
[03:48.86]I just have had them for like half a decade.
[03:51.94]The Winter Cases are dog shit?
[03:53.36]What?
[03:55.46]That's like half the inventory, I think.
[03:59.20]Is that how... I think that might be... Oh, well, you could... Okay, well, you're not even going to want to watch that part.
[04:04.60]The most expensive item you can get is five cents.
[04:08.71]What, on the marketplace?
[04:12.07]Oh, whatever.
[04:13.93]I got 25 keys.
[04:15.03]Okay, Tony Montana.
[04:21.22]I... I have... Guys, I haven't opened a TF2 box...
[04:28.60]As of like the last seven days, it's been almost, it's been like seven or eight years.
[04:35.42]It's been a very long time.
[04:41.37]It's just, I have a lot of these boxes in my inventory.
[04:43.79]I did a full inventory cleanup.
[04:47.59]And you know what happens when you do an inventory cleanup in Team Fortress?
[04:51.81]You, well, this is what I do.
[04:55.21]Each backpack slot is another class slot.
[04:59.48]So one is scout, two is soldier, backpack slot three is pyro, right?
[05:05.50]I like to keep it very organized.
[05:06.78]And when I did that, I realized I had like 80 crates.
[05:11.06]I'm just like, what do I do with all these?
[05:12.60]And then I was told don't open all these ones because they're terrible.
[05:15.86]But I got war paint cases.
[05:17.49]I've got cosmetic cases from the last five years.
[05:20.39]I don't know.
[05:20.65]I'll just open them.
[05:22.81]Sort by type.
[05:23.57]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[05:24.61]I'm terrified to click that button because there's no undo.
[05:28.47]Alright.
[05:28.85]Okay.
[05:29.07]Stop stalling.
[05:29.51]I'm going to be here for like two, three hours.
[05:31.21]So no stalling.
[05:31.95]No stalling.
[05:33.79]Yeah.
[05:34.05]No stalling.
[05:34.41]Let's go.
[05:34.61]I'm going to play Halls of Torment for a little bit and then we'll play some TF2.
[05:39.17]Opening up some cases and crates.
[05:42.31]Play the game.
[05:42.71]I know, I know.
[05:43.13]I got to go.
[05:43.71]I know I have to do it.
[05:48.87]I like this game.
[05:50.79]Alright, so we left off Halls of Torment a few days ago.
[05:54.76]Give me all the loot for safekeeping.
[05:56.82]Wink, wink.
[05:59.50]It's kind of funny because I've... I know.
[06:01.86]Go, go, dude, go.
[06:02.90]You only got two hours.
[06:03.84]Go.
[06:05.76]But let me tell you a story.
[06:09.64]Hold on, let me just get... I've got 3,000 gold.
[06:11.23]Damn.
[06:11.63]Alright, I want to refund all because I'm playing the burn character.
[06:21.24]So we're gonna do some crazy shit with the burn character.
[06:24.72]Start talking about Diablo 4.
[06:30.69]I should give you guys my takes more often because I saw a few comments of people saying like, oh man, like this is like one of the only things he's ever said that I like agree with.
[06:38.51]Should I give you my takes more often instead of just, okay.
[06:42.74]The only takes you guys get from me are like,
[06:47.52]Dog food flavors.
[06:49.92]And I'm just, like, fucking around, right?
[06:52.00]But, like, you never get, like, a real take from me, so you can never get my real opinions on anything.
[06:55.56]So the only opinions you get from me are dog food.
[06:58.80]So that's why all of you think I'm... I'm, like, a psycho.
[07:02.81]Because I never give you a real take.
[07:05.07]And the comedy takes I give are about eating dog food, so I get it.
[07:08.79]I completely understand that now.
[07:13.33]Alright, so this is the fire character.
[07:16.81]He's so fake.
[07:22.03]I'm maxing this out.
[07:22.95]What do you think?
[07:31.91]Projectile size and attack speed.
[07:36.07]I think that's fine.
[07:38.98]Dog food takes.
[07:44.76]Revives are pretty big too.
[07:51.85]Say something controversial, please.
[07:55.11]Um... No, I don't... What should I put the last one in?
[08:01.67]Damage?
[08:03.12]Damage and defense?
[08:05.20]What are your thoughts on the new Airbus?
[08:06.84]Like the new airplane?
[08:07.70]I don't know.
[08:17.97]Uh, I'm actually going to take away regen and get movement speed with this character.
[08:23.31]Alright, cool.
[08:24.70]What do we got for items?
[08:27.02]Oh my god, he hates the air bus.
[08:30.80]What's so new about it?
[08:31.76]What does it do?
[08:36.09]You need to go on a rant.
[08:39.21]Dude, hey, go on a rant.
[08:44.72]No, you don't want a rant.
[08:46.21]Like, you don't want a bunch of takes from me.
[08:48.71]Trust me.
[08:51.73]But back when Diablo II came out... What's a good item I should take?
[08:57.83]You don't.
[08:58.21]No, you don't.
[08:58.83]You really don't.
[08:59.43]I'm telling you.
[09:04.03]Three of you are going to go, paste.
[09:08.06]And 10,000 of you are going to go, what is it?
[09:09.84]Shut up.
[09:17.06]That's a good one.
[09:22.62]That's huge too.
[09:23.52]So this is 40% crit damage and 10% base crit chance.
[09:26.94]That's cool.
[09:28.00]I remember getting those.
[09:28.82]Uh, we're going with this.
[09:33.41]I'm ready to play one of my new favorites from 2023.
[09:41.03]I think I'm strong enough to try.
[09:42.21]Should I try to actually beat the boss?
[09:45.15]You have an NA education.
[09:46.21]Yes, I do.
[09:46.59]What do you want me to say?
[09:50.21]Yes.
[09:51.67]You want me to deny that?
[09:52.61]No, I don't.
[09:53.90]Shut up, idiot.
[09:54.66]No, I don't.
[09:55.48]Yeah, I do.
[09:55.92]Yeah, I have a North American education.
[09:58.28]Does that make you angry with me?
[10:06.64]Alright, so I have auto attack on, which, holy shit, I am way stronger than I used to be.
[10:15.26]Okay, this is going great.
[10:17.16]We're going to do attack speed.
[10:25.46]What was this doing before?
[10:26.28]Like 20?
[10:30.34]Already leveled up twice.
[10:31.24]It's always damaged.
[10:35.66]WM1 gameplay.
[10:36.46]Yeah, but this is my favorite.
[10:37.54]It's probably my favorite character so far.
[10:46.11]Is it always movement speed or should I finally do pick up range and have the people that were very mad at me last time that I didn't pick it up pick it up?
[10:54.88]Time is moving too fast.
[10:57.40]It's so fucked up that it's August of 2023.
[10:59.04]Why is it?
[11:00.62]What happened to 2020?
[11:02.44]Well, I think I can explain what you're feeling.
[11:07.32]COVID deleted two years.
[11:10.17]Yeah, COVID essentially just absolutely liquidated two full years.
[11:14.53]That's why it feels like 2021, because 2020 and 2021 and some of 2022 barely even happened.
[11:21.26]So, yeah.
[11:22.86]We time-traveled from 2020 to 2023 in a lot of ways.
[11:29.54]Um... I don't know what to do here.
[11:34.60]I'm doing pickup range.
[11:36.32]I know that was not great, but somebody put their hand through their monitor, but it's alright.
[11:49.37]We should make a petition to petition to revert back to 2021.
[11:57.09]That's kind of interesting.
[11:58.35]That's weird.
[12:00.77]Ladies and gentlemen, we have decided in Congress we are going to be introducing the Rewind Time Act.
[12:09.12]Myself and Senator Stevenson over there thought it was a good idea to rewind time back to 2021 because COVID fucked up everything for two years.
[12:31.64]You've already used two rewinds.
[12:37.04]We made up time anyways.
[12:40.20]Isn't there like a wild theory that we're in the wrong year?
[12:43.14]I heard that somewhere.
[12:45.96]That it's actually like... It's not like 2000.
[12:49.29]We're living in like the 1400s or something.
[12:53.77]Right?
[12:53.95]Isn't that what I heard?
[12:54.87]Isn't that what you heard?
[12:56.25]I heard that.
[12:57.07]Did you hear that?
[12:57.55]Bro, you talked about this already.
[12:59.79]No, I didn't.
[13:08.99]I heard that we could be like way further in the future or way earlier.
[13:13.02]You heard that theory?
[13:15.14]I probably heard this theory on a fucking YouTube short that I scrolled by.
[13:26.59]Dude, every time I open up YouTube Shorts, I just gotta tell you, I think I'm getting older.
[13:33.55]I'm getting a lot older.
[13:34.56]I can definitely feel myself growing up, but I scroll through YouTube Shorts and I just go, what is going on?
[13:40.62]What is happening?
[13:46.45]I'm like, am I older?
[13:47.67]I'm too old now.
[13:49.03]I'm too old for this.
[13:50.77]What's happening?
[13:55.88]That's a cool theory.
[13:56.92]I'm 22 and I feel that way.
[14:08.41]Go to the blood trail.
[14:10.00]I want to get strong first.
[14:11.56]Dude, you're crazy.
[14:14.92]I don't, I don't know.
[14:15.54]I don't think so.
[14:19.90]I will scroll through YouTube shorts.
[14:23.22]And I just kind of, after like 10, I just stop.
[14:29.00]And then I go back up three because I go, there's no fucking way that's what I just watched like a minute and a half ago, is it?
[14:34.84]And I give that person like five more views in a row.
[14:38.17]You know what I mean?
[14:45.09]It's just like, no, there's no way that what I just watched was what I just watched.
[14:48.07]Oh, it was, was it?
[14:56.93]If you don't understand Skibidi Toilet, you're fine.
[15:00.51]I've seen it.
[15:02.59]I've seen it.
[15:03.69]I watched it.
[15:05.03]I don't think I saw the whole thing.
[15:05.99]These are all good.
[15:13.80]That's the one where the people with the cameras for faces are like punching the people with the toilets, right?
[15:18.78]They're like in a gigantic, there's like a big fight.
[15:25.36]Who told him?
[15:28.95]What do you mean, who told him?
[15:30.05]I saw it.
[15:32.78]And I was just like, oh, what the fuck is happening in this?
[15:39.52]Okay, let me pay attention.
[15:42.58]He's becoming too advanced.
[15:46.02]I want the burn chance.
[15:48.34]And no, I'm not going to be playing this optimally, I know.
[15:51.95]This is a good game for me to hang out and just talk and chill.
[15:54.39]Which is, I like doing that, it's fun.
[15:56.81]So if I pick the wrong thing, I'm just hanging out.
[16:00.27]We're just chilling.
[16:00.85]Don't worry.
[16:05.71]Zoomer humor enjoyer Andy.
[16:08.07]I've made this statement before and it's very, very real.
[16:12.29]Oh yeah.
[16:14.83]Zoomer humor is over very quickly.
[16:23.04]I brought up this very important point.
[16:25.88]When you talk about Zoomer humor, I can decide if I liked something in literally eight seconds.
[16:31.45]Boomer humor, I might have to sit there for 30 minutes while they explain like a whole thing and then tell it to me, like at the end of that.
[16:38.13]So it's like the one good thing for me about Zoomer humor is it's either good or it's not very quickly.
[16:45.59]So, but I do love that Boomer humor style where you kind of have to tell a whole elaborate story, but one thing that might be kind of funny in the middle.
[16:58.66]I very much enjoy the boomer humor style.
[17:02.90]But.
[17:04.27]Zoomer humor is quick.
[17:06.19]It's to the point and it gets going very quickly.
[17:10.49]I want health.
[17:13.91]Defense or let's do regen.
[17:19.26]There's no setup.
[17:19.90]Yeah, I like a big setup.
[17:21.10]I think that's pretty obvious.
[17:22.72]If any of you have been here for long enough.
[17:28.30]Honestly, the setup to me is a lot of times more fun than actually telling the joke.
[17:33.48]It's sometimes way more fun.
[17:43.85]You don't like to do Airbus.
[17:44.73]Do you prefer the 787?
[17:45.67]I don't prefer any... I don't... I don't... Sure.
[18:02.71]I don't have like an airplane preference.
[18:06.86]Although I guess maybe the newer ones are just, they're outfitted better with more amenities.
[18:11.80]I guess, I don't know.
[18:19.57]What do you mean what?
[18:20.75]I said the newer ones are outfitted with more amenities.
[18:22.51]Is that, wait, is it?
[18:26.05]You literally flew a plane.
[18:29.66]Definitely this.
[18:30.50]Wait.
[18:35.59]Probably the Dragon's Breath carried that entire time I got close.
[18:44.24]You did.
[18:44.64]No, I did.
[18:46.56]Me and Austin show.
[18:47.74]I was on his flight show.
[18:51.82]That was really cool.
[18:53.72]That was a great time.
[18:57.85]How come you hate the Council of Sorcery so much?
[19:00.69]I don't.
[19:05.83]Do you have a private jet?
[19:09.35]I feel like if I flew in a private jet one time, it would be over.
[19:16.00]I would probably wipe out my entire bank account.
[19:18.10]Everything.
[19:19.38]I don't think that's a good idea.
[19:23.43]That's probably a really bad idea.
[19:35.01]I don't even know how much even is... Okay, if I were to take a private jet, a private plane, how much does it even cost?
[19:42.77]I don't even know.
[19:53.89]It's $10,000 minimum.
[19:54.37]Yeah, I...
[20:02.25]No, no, no, no, no, I don't think so.
[20:05.75]I don't think so.
[20:17.56]Not worth it.
[20:18.94]No, it I don't.
[20:22.76]For me.
[20:24.72]I mean, I hate flying.
[20:25.84]I don't like airplanes.
[20:27.38]I'm not afraid of flying.
[20:28.81]It's just the whole travel experience to me.
[20:32.99]It's like the having to go through into the terminal and go through the security area and wait for everybody to get on the plane and get on the plane and then sit there and then it takes it takes like three hours to get on an airplane sometimes.
[20:47.53]I hate it.
[20:49.03]I don't hate being in the air.
[20:50.53]I just, I just don't like the whole prospect of the amount of time and how annoying it is to actually get into the plane in the first place.
[20:57.50]Ooh.
[21:09.42]But is that worth, like, 9,000 extra dollars?
[21:14.20]Because even a first-class ticket on some of these airlines, that's already a huge premium on that seat.
[21:23.04]I don't think I would want to pay, like, a thousand percent premium to get on, like, a pri- I don't know.
[21:28.25]No.
[21:29.55]No.
[21:32.95]You could afford it.
[21:36.64]I think a lot of you guys may be overestimating my finances a little.
[21:42.54]Dude, bro, you could do it, dude.
[21:44.32]Just take a private plane everywhere you fucking go.
[21:46.58]It's only like 20 grand a flight.
[21:48.21]You got the money.
[21:49.49]You'll be fine.
[21:52.61]I think you guys may be overestimating my financial ability to fly on a private plane all the time.
[22:08.10]What is it?
[22:11.08]I already own all of these.
[22:18.53]You rented a baseball field.
[22:22.81]Yeah, that was for a stream that a lot of time and a lot of energy went into.
[22:29.57]Me renting a baseball field out versus getting on a private plane?
[22:34.96]That's... Those are two very different things.
[22:37.70]Those are not even close.
[22:44.68]I guess I'm just gonna take it.
[22:45.52]Because I can deposit it because I don't have it yet, right?
[22:49.91]This is physical attacks, though.
[22:51.27]Meh.
[22:55.01]Do a private jet stream.
[22:56.64]No.
[22:56.84]No, I don't want to do that.
[22:59.86]No, thank you.
[23:11.51]That whole stream is what?
[23:12.39]Just me flying on an airplane and reading a newspaper.
[23:19.24]And grabbing the sprite out of the flight attendant's hand, just being like, thank you.
[23:26.72]Thank you.
[23:29.50]That's it.
[23:30.20]That's all the content.
[23:33.58]Thank you.
[23:34.06]Thank you.
[23:38.18]And then maybe like an hour goes by and I'm like, excuse me.
[23:41.14]Do you guys have headphones?
[23:47.62]Thank you.
[23:52.59]Regen.
[23:53.11]No!
[23:54.12]Multi-hit.
[24:10.20]Didn't bring your own headphones.
[24:13.65]Headphones is always... I just... I don't really do... Okay.
[24:17.63]A lot of you here, headphones might be a very important accessory you take everywhere.
[24:24.62]I do not.
[24:26.20]Headphones to me are something that has to be packed.
[24:29.56]I never carry them.
[24:30.56]They're never on me.
[24:32.00]I don't really... Oh, I've got my earbuds in or whatever.
[24:39.39]Not really.
[24:42.17]So headphones to me are not an object I carry on me frequently.
[24:53.47]You need to go down.
[24:55.97]Yep.
[24:57.74]We're just talking.
[24:58.26]Alright, I'm going up.
[25:05.50]I don't want to deposit this to the well yet because I might get a better item.
[25:22.11]Do you just sit and stare at a wall during a plane ride?
[25:25.41]I mean, no.
[25:28.25]I'll do stuff on like tablets and stuff.
[25:35.80]Or sometimes, you know, you get TV in front of you.
[25:39.72]Sometimes that's that's fun.
[25:46.29]I'll load up.
[25:47.47]You know, it's great on an airplane.
[25:50.13]It doesn't matter how many times you've seen it.
[25:54.17]Here's the strat.
[25:54.97]Are you ready for the strategy?
[25:57.19]If your plane ride is more than three hours long, or about two to three hours long, go play the Curb Your Enthusiasm roulette.
[26:05.50]You go pick four random Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes.
[26:10.02]It doesn't matter what they are.
[26:11.66]Just pick them out randomly.
[26:12.73]Because even if you've seen it already, it's still going to be good.
[26:18.39]That's the strategy for every airplane.
[26:22.19]From any season, doesn't matter what it is.
[26:30.04]That's a boomer show?
[26:31.68]I want that person actually timed out.
[26:34.18]That was... What you just said was offensive to me.
[26:37.48]Time them out.
[26:46.50]Two minutes?
[26:47.42]At least a minute.
[26:51.21]I'm going pick up range Andy right now.
[26:58.08]While I'm still doing pretty good damage.
[27:03.02]They got timed out.
[27:03.74]Stop saying Andy.
[27:08.79]We don't even say it here.
[27:12.69]I do.
[27:14.35]What do you mean?
[27:15.33]I'm saying it right now.
[27:16.29]I say it all.
[27:16.93]What do you mean we don't say it here?
[27:18.29]I say it every stream, like a hundred times a stream.
[27:25.79]Maybe you don't, but I do.
[27:31.85]Did you?
[27:32.21]I read that wrong.
[27:37.03]Oh, did I read that wrong?
[27:38.73]What did you say?
[27:41.31]You're overusing.
[27:42.13]You're overusing it.
[27:47.10]We love Andy here.
[27:48.52]We love saying Andy.
[27:53.90]It's just such a quick way to get a point across about anything.
[27:57.66]It just really is.
[27:58.36]Like I told you, Zoomer.
[28:03.31]Well, that's... I don't think Andy is Zoomer.
[28:05.53]That's more Millennial.
[28:06.75]But like Millennial versus Boomer.
[28:10.49]Like me sitting here and explaining this.
[28:13.39]What you're seeing on the screen.
[28:14.57]This character.
[28:17.90]Well, this character, I'll tell you.
[28:20.67]At some point throughout the last hundred years or so, fire became a device that was able to be used coming out of a propulsion machine that has oil and a propulsion mechanism with an emulsifier in it.
[28:34.79]And what that does is that allows the fire to go forward and be able to do what you're doing, wiping out all those monsters that I see, and it's a pretty wonderful invention.
[28:45.18]Versus
[28:47.12]Flamethrower Andy.
[28:50.02]I can get my point across very quickly.
[29:03.97]Oh yes.
[29:08.80]You just lost 100 viewers.
[29:13.68]It's alright.
[29:14.02]They're either going to be back or they're not.
[29:17.46]Don't worry about how many people are here or not.
[29:20.13]They're going to come back or they're not.
[29:23.51]Don't worry.
[29:31.03]Don't worry.
[29:31.73]I'm at work.
[29:39.13]Say hi.
[29:41.47]Am I on a work TV?
[30:00.25]Man, I'll tell you.
[30:02.19]The finance department is doing such an unbelievable job.
[30:08.34]If you can hear this right now,
[30:10.85]A lot of the departments that are working for this company are doing fantastic.
[30:14.10]It's a great experience I've had working with them.
[30:16.84]I have never worked with them, by the way, just for complete transparency's sake.
[30:19.54]I've never worked with anybody here.
[30:20.42]I don't know what this job is, and I don't condone or support anything that anybody's doing unless it's proven to what that could be otherwise.
[30:26.46]So that was a joke, and I have no idea what you do, and I have no idea what's going on in this business.
[30:42.13]It's too late.
[30:54.25]Centrist Andy.
[30:57.31]I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
[30:59.83]That person could have just made that up just like I did.
[31:08.38]Verify your information, everybody, before you make any... Make sure you verify info.
[31:23.42]Make sure you... I love how that turned... I love how that dumb joke just turned into... Verify info.
[31:30.08]Okay.
[31:33.86]You turned it into a PSA.
[31:35.30]Yeah, I did.
[31:52.45]Can you please do your Adam Sandler bee sting on tongue impression?
[32:02.36]Is that close?
[32:06.77]I think that's what you meant.
[32:12.19]Is that what you meant?
[32:17.63]I feel like that's what you meant.
[32:22.06]What happened to nighttime streams?
[32:24.62]Uh, well, the reason why I'm streaming so early... is because... Ster is coming into Vegas.
[32:31.82]So... I wanna get prepared for Ster.
[32:39.62]I'll be hanging out with Ster.
[32:40.58]Are you gonna do an IRL stream?
[32:45.52]No.
[32:47.60]No.
[32:52.35]Something new.
[32:55.43]Oh, shit.
[32:56.57]One of these is good.
[33:03.85]What do you mean prepare?
[33:04.77]I don't know.
[33:07.67]When you have a friend coming into town, you want to make sure that like... Things look a little cleaner.
[33:15.17]Things look better.
[33:16.01]It's not like a... I don't know.
[33:18.94]I want to make sure I get an itinerary for fun stuff to do.
[33:22.10]What are you talking about?
[33:24.87]You don't prepare for an arrival for someone if they're coming in that week?
[33:30.29]What are you talking about?
[33:36.97]I think it's these.
[33:37.43]Are you guys going to watch Barbie?
[33:46.62]I don't think so.
[33:53.51]What are the specs of your PC?
[33:55.01]I don't even know.
[33:56.41]It's been a long time.
[33:57.29]I think I have a command.
[34:02.17]Isn't there a command to tell you guys what's in my computer?
[34:09.87]Did I used to have one of those?
[34:14.88]Oh, there it is.
[34:15.36]Okay, let me tell you.
[34:16.12]I have 864p.
[34:17.88]That's not right.
[34:20.12]Did it pop up?
[34:26.40]I'm so, I'm still pissed off that you called me Ball Fondler instead of Bomb Fondler during the Day of the Diver.
[34:31.96]Oh, that's your, okay.
[34:33.27]Well, but you're still in the Ball Fondler category though, because there's three X's before your name.
[34:37.65]And you have Ball after the three X's.
[34:39.35]Come on, you got to give me a little bit of credit.
[34:41.05]The chat goes by fast a lot sometimes.
[34:44.78]Yeah, I've got a 3090 and a... I don't even know.
[34:50.62]Is it AMD or Intel in here?
[34:53.12]AMD 5600X.
[34:55.24]I got 64 gigabytes of RAM.
[35:03.50]I know that these ones are probably better, but I'm going to take these.
[35:05.98]And I'm going to deposit this because I think it's fun.
[35:08.18]That's what I'm playing this game for.
[35:11.86]Now I'm going to deposit that when I come back up.
[35:16.88]Should I wear it?
[35:17.38]10 crit for... I don't think you can compete with 10% base crit, but is crit damage better than having skeletons run around?
[35:29.41]Probably not.
[35:43.40]Are you going to shave before stirs here?
[35:44.96]Oh.
[35:54.29]Ster prefer Boeing or Airbus.
[35:58.47]I don't know.
[36:16.51]Please choose range for the love of God.
[36:20.21]This is just a warmup round.
[36:24.78]And plus we're just talking, I'm just hanging out.
[36:27.84]I'm not trying to optimally play the video game.
[36:31.24]I'm trying to survive long enough to talk over it.
[36:37.70]That's kind of funny.
[36:43.81]But look, look how much better this is than range.
[36:52.62]I'm getting a lot of items.
[36:57.54]Okay.
[36:59.72]I feel like phantom needles is good here.
[37:02.01]This is just... No.
[37:03.19]Transfection is amazing.
[37:05.95]Just does so much damage.
[37:18.13]What is Ster's astrological sign?
[37:19.94]Um...
[37:23.80]I don't know.
[37:24.18]He's a night elf.
[37:24.74]I don't know.
[37:44.55]Hmm.
[37:45.91]Range.
[37:46.33]Take the range.
[37:46.93]Alright.
[37:49.89]Now I got to go up here.
[37:55.71]I gotta start doing some survivability here.
[38:06.08]I'm going to deposit the skeleton ring.
[38:09.96]That's a good idea.
[38:14.64]What is this 10% fragile chance?
[38:17.66]What is fragile?
[38:18.54]Let's see.
[38:25.97]For each stack, affliction increases the damage taken from damage over time.
[38:29.57]Well, that's amazing.
[38:32.21]Modifies the chance to apply effects on enemies.
[38:34.03]For every 100% chance, one stack is guaranteed.
[38:36.55]Huh.
[38:50.99]Hey, Jerma, let's go!
[38:52.03]Where are we going?
[38:56.53]What are we going?
[39:05.86]This one.
[39:09.74]I want to be.
[39:10.56]This is an opportunity to beat the actual boss here.
[39:30.04]Alright, I gotta stop going down.
[39:31.26]Gotta go up.
[39:38.04]Great chance.
[39:52.08]All the bloodstains, bro.
[39:54.76]Am I ready for the bloodstain yet?
[39:58.33]Should I get a little bit stronger?
[39:59.41]Am I ready to do it?
[40:00.83]Because I'm imagining it's going to summon like a hard boss or something.
[40:03.07]I don't think I'm ready for it.
[40:11.91]Watching you play this makes me want to eat my own hands.
[40:18.22]I could probably think of a few other things you could be doing if you really wanted to not do that.
[40:29.43]This one.
[40:42.76]Yeah, I'm not.
[40:43.56]I'm not very locked in right now.
[40:44.88]I'm looking over the chat reading.
[40:46.53]This is this is more like a podcast stream.
[40:50.67]Ooh.
[40:51.05]It's a lot of area.
[41:08.90]What am I getting hit by?
[41:13.41]Lightning.
[41:17.67]Let me at least deposit this.
[41:24.52]I can't take anything else.
[41:35.13]Alright, last pass.
[41:36.12]I'll get the last pass here.
[41:37.88]Alright, now I'm going up.
[41:49.36]I'm going to go get the magnet too.
[41:52.35]Will we ever return to The Sims?
[41:54.45]Yeah, definitely.
[41:56.61]Sims is a great game just to open up and just play it whenever.
[41:59.37]Even if there's no mods on it, it's just fun to start a new person.
[42:03.51]So, yeah.
[42:07.55]It's kind of a staple, isn't it?
[42:14.30]The Sims is always fun, no matter what.
[42:21.65]But I never want to overdo it, though.
[42:22.77]I feel like The Sims is one of those things where it's really fun for like a week, and then you kind of let it go for six months, come back, and it's a whole new fresh fun experience again.
[42:33.57]You can kind of do that over and over again.
[42:44.83]You'd like Project Zomboid?
[42:46.05]I thought about playing Project Zomboid.
[42:47.67]I want to.
[42:48.07]There's a lot of games to play.
[43:00.65]And I have lots of potential streaming stuff to do.
[43:11.88]And it works out a lot, especially for somebody.
[43:14.04]I mean, as you know.
[43:16.84]The stream reduction that a lot of you guys have been used to this.
[43:19.86]Well, not even reduction, but.
[43:23.07]Hold on, I don't want to die.
[43:32.45]You can play Borderlands 2.
[43:34.67]Probably not.
[43:39.93]Tomboy is boring and overrated.
[43:44.85]I think I just never played it because it reminded me almost of looking at Path of Exile the first time.
[43:50.68]Where it's just like, this is, look, this seems very, this seems like a lot going on here that I don't know if I want to give the time to learn about it.
[44:00.56]Is that correct?
[44:09.45]Kind of.
[44:10.01]No, actually, yeah.
[44:15.93]Alright.
[44:17.63]That one guy saying pick range, I hope they're happy because I've picked it like eight times in a row.
[44:31.56]Definitely this.
[44:44.85]Let's deposit this.
[44:47.15]So I can do skeleton friends.
[44:51.15]Eventually.
[44:54.83]It's a hard learning curve, but it's really fun.
[44:59.40]It does look very fun.
[45:02.58]I will say.
[45:07.28]Max out dragon breath as fast as possible.
[45:10.19]Because it's the best ability in the game.
[45:12.61]From what I've seen.
[45:19.18]Ouch.
[45:24.71]Jeez.
[45:26.33]What is hitting me?
[45:38.40]Hurry up.
[45:38.84]Die.
[45:39.32]Okay.
[45:42.42]Firewalker boots or I can't really take these anyways.
[45:45.18]Do I remember missing anything?
[45:46.72]No.
[45:50.60]This is cool for this character, but these really don't seem like they're that good.
[46:02.00]I mean, I'm the fire character, but the fire doesn't seem that great.
[46:07.82]15% movement speed seems just good.
[46:10.50]No matter what.
[46:12.36]The boots are amazing for bosses, though.
[46:19.59]You use them, they suck.
[46:21.57]I use them with the not fire character.
[46:24.61]And I feel like I have a lot of burn and a lot of bonuses to fire right now.
[46:31.76]You should try Baldur's Gate.
[46:33.00]I've heard a lot about Baldur's Gate and I'm kind of afraid to put any time into it because I feel like it's one of those games where you need to know an entire encyclopedia before you start playing it.
[46:41.91]Is that true?
[46:50.05]Not true.
[46:54.13]I think any, because Baldur's Gate is a D&D kind of, based on D&D, right?
[46:59.96]All I remember was hearing about, oh, this game is like kind of built on top of D&D.
[47:05.00]It's like a D&D game.
[47:06.81]Oh, cool.
[47:07.01]It was never winter.
[47:09.18]And I remember being like, whoa, I mean, I can play this as a ton of like characters and classes.
[47:13.92]And I remember playing this character that just, I was so disappointed in the game because I was playing it wrong.
[47:23.76]And I remember just like playing it.
[47:25.19]And the character I made, the only move that the character had was they went like, they did like a whistle or like a sing.
[47:32.73]And that was it.
[47:33.09]That's the only move I did.
[47:34.09]And I was like, this is not, I'm not having any fun.
[47:39.45]I had, like, one move.
[47:40.97]I was like, why do I... I don't... I'm playing this so wrong, aren't I?
[47:46.47]I think I was playing, like, a musical character.
[47:52.49]Like a bard or something.
[48:03.04]That was Pepino?
[48:04.12]Yeah!
[48:07.10]Yeah!
[48:09.22]god damn it it was I'll take him is it weird that sometimes I just go to youtube and type in um pepino scream and just listen to it like 10 times in a row and then go on with my day is that weird
[48:36.62]I do this not that often.
[48:39.33]Maybe once every couple months.
[48:57.25]What about Mortal Kombat 1?
[48:58.23]Yeah, I'll play it.
[49:04.91]I'll play Mortal Kombat 1.
[49:08.62]You guys can all queue up and just absolutely shit on me.
[49:12.48]We'll make a fun night out of it.
[49:23.98]More area, yes.
[49:27.88]Alright, I gotta start looking for health.
[49:32.72]Because I'm almost at the 30 minutes.
[49:39.39]I beat the boss last time, right?
[49:42.61]Yeah, I did.
[49:43.91]I got to the end.
[49:45.45]With the other character.
[49:47.93]Do the blood trail?
[49:49.16]Um, no.
[49:50.54]I'm afraid.
[49:52.10]I'm scared of it.
[49:59.86]Why did that person just write stimulus?
[50:04.39]Why did you do that?
[50:15.95]WM1 Andy, yeah.
[50:19.53]You know what else is really funny too about getting a little older?
[50:22.32]Kind of starting to feel myself grow up a lot.
[50:26.34]Back when I first played Team Fortress 2, I remember.
[50:29.32]I remember being like, oh, WM1, come on.
[50:32.79]You could do better than that.
[50:37.17]You suck at this game.
[50:38.79]What's with this?
[50:39.67]Oh, Pyro, of course.
[50:40.85]Pyro sucks.
[50:43.86]Now I'm just like, oh man, I like this class a lot.
[50:47.04]This vlog class, I just can walk forward for a second.
[50:49.97]It's so funny.
[51:01.60]Everybody talks shit about Pyro until they play Pyro and then they're quiet.
[51:06.92]Right?
[51:07.32]You ever notice that?
[51:09.60]Sit there, you get killed by a Pyro, and it's like, fucking idiot.
[51:12.54]What do you fucking even know about this game?
[51:14.10]What do you even know about aiming?
[51:16.34]And then you pick Pyro, and you just kind of silently play it, and you're like, wow, this is a lot of fun.
[51:24.18]I'm quiet.
[51:26.04]No, I'm not having any fun.
[51:26.90]No, don't say that.
[51:28.72]I'm not having fun.
[51:42.59]I've definitely come to appreciate pyro a lot more in like the.
[51:47.34]In the second.
[51:48.94]Kind of.
[51:50.24]Half of my.
[51:52.16]Kind of online life.
[51:56.08]It's like wow pyro is cool.
[51:58.11]I always like pyro though.
[51:59.15]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[52:12.48]I actually, I'm gonna be quiet for real.
[52:13.98]It's funny, I'll say that about Spy too.
[52:24.68]Right, you get absolutely dominated by a Spy that's just kicking everybody's ass in the server and you're like, oh, what the fuck?
[52:30.06]Like, fuck you.
[52:32.20]Fuck you.
[52:33.52]And then you play Spy and like bump into three walls and don't hit anybody.
[52:37.50]You face stab a person and die instantly and you're zero for your team.
[52:44.15]And it's just like, oh right, this is like kind of like takes like a lot of skill to really kind of do this reliably.
[52:53.66]Forgot.
[53:07.21]Yes.
[53:09.73]Alright, three minutes and then I'm going to pay attention.
[53:16.20]I'm actually kind of excited about opening those boxes.
[53:18.08]It's been a long time since I've done something like that, really.
[53:22.52]It's time for some loot get.
[53:34.57]That's right.
[53:41.82]Where's that magnet?
[53:47.94]There it is.
[53:48.34]This is the second one too.
[53:56.24]Burn chance or?
[53:57.42]Yeah.
[53:58.74]No, I think I'm taking.
[54:01.22]Crit because the boss is about to run in.
[54:04.19]I'd rather be able to do damage quickly.
[54:09.17]Yeah.
[54:14.59]Holy shit, that's so much.
[54:22.40]It's hard to even see because it's coming in so much.
[54:26.66]What is going on?
[54:27.58]Okay.
[54:28.18]More crit.
[54:36.03]Level 60.
[54:43.92]More crit.
[54:51.35]Alright, I'm ready for the boss.
[54:52.93]I'm only going to take health regen now if I see it.
[55:01.50]Health and health regen is the only thing I'm going to pick up.
[55:03.20]Uh oh.
[55:25.09]I gotta turn on auto attack.
[55:27.75]There it is.
[55:28.13]Because I want to auto attack the boss and just focus on moving around.
[55:38.16]Nice, it's got a health potion, I think.
[55:47.12]What about Viewfinder?
[55:50.91]That's what we will open with next week.
[55:55.54]That's the.
[55:56.30]Because I do really want to play that game.
[55:59.12]It looked really just like a nice experience.
[56:04.84]Alright, 40 seconds or so.
[56:13.06]I'm getting kind of collapsed on here.
[56:37.12]I think taking the 50 health is better because in the amount of time it would take me to get 50 health from this, it would be too late.
[56:54.88]Alright, let's do it.
[56:55.44]Yeah, I want to beat it with the second character.
[56:56.66]Come on.
[56:56.84]Alright, here we go.
[57:55.03]Fuckin' that pole just screwed everything up.
[57:57.15]I'm good.
[58:01.32]Get away from these poles, they're ruining everything.
[58:03.76]Actually just ruined the whole run.
[58:31.56]Shit, I didn't have enough movement speed and those poles ruined everything.
[58:40.55]When he does the three in a row, the like... If you don't have enough movement speed, you're going to get hit no matter what.
[58:47.01]It's alright.
[58:56.73]Let's do it again.
[59:03.20]What did I... Wow, shit, I didn't even look at the unlocks.
[59:14.65]Where... Is it Milestone?
[59:16.79]Story?
[59:17.37]Swift?
[59:17.79]There it is.
[59:20.20]Alright, I got 750 gold for this one.
[59:26.86]Already got that.
[59:35.79]Money.
[59:37.27]Stream of fire.
[59:40.41]Traits.
[59:41.47]What did I unlock?
[59:46.39]Are you going to abandon sorcery?
[59:49.99]No.
[59:51.77]At the very least, we will conclude sorcery.
[59:54.82]I'm telling you.
[60:01.74]Didn't I deposit the
[60:05.98]Oh shit, I have to buy it, that's right.
[60:14.31]I want that.
[60:17.31]Deal 4% additional damage for each burning enemy, up to 60%.
[60:35.26]I like the fire character.
[60:41.38]It's very good.
[60:46.56]I think I'm good with this.
[60:47.36]Attack.
[60:54.21]Maybe just more damage.
[60:55.09]Just straight up damage.
[61:01.53]Hmm.
[61:01.99]Hmm.
[61:09.88]This is becoming a problem.
[61:15.06]More health and regen from the beginning.
[61:19.21]What's a new game you're looking forward to the most?
[61:22.27]The Elden Ring DLC.
[61:23.03]I don't think anything even compares.
[61:24.59]Alright, I'm going again.
[61:37.47]That hasn't been announced.
[61:39.33]That was a great spawn.
[61:40.93]Radiant aura.
[61:43.85]Cast light that distributes its damage equally among all foes in its range.
[61:48.69]Automatically cast in intervals.
[61:50.11]Let's try it.
[61:55.39]Ah, I like this a lot.
[62:03.26]They announced the Elden Ring DLC.
[62:04.26]They didn't announce when it was coming out, but they announced it was being worked on.
[62:12.80]I actually just shit my pants.
[62:15.18]I feel bad for you.
[62:16.50]Because it sucks when that happens.
[62:19.29]Genuinely, it's really not fun.
[62:22.53]So, yeah.
[62:24.00]Sorry about that.
[62:28.70]You know what's funny about what you just said, though?
[62:30.20]Imagine shitting your pants and sitting there after shitting your pants.
[62:33.50]You just did it.
[62:35.26]And typing into a chat, Hey, I just shit my pants for real.
[62:41.77]While you're just sitting there?
[62:42.85]Like, okay.
[62:44.15]You should probably go take care of it first.
[62:46.59]Then talk about it.
[62:49.69]I think that that's probably a good order of operations there.
[62:59.12]Now it would have been even funnier if you wrote, oh my god, I just shit my pants, comma, space, what do I do?
[63:06.48]That would have added a little bit for me.
[63:10.13]Because that means you're just still sitting there and you're just like, I don't know what to do about this.
[63:15.11]Please stop, I'm eating.
[63:23.85]Sometimes I forget that, because I'm this way too.
[63:30.25]Anytime the TV is on or anytime.
[63:32.33]I'm watching any media Food is part of the picture at least 70 to 80 percent of the time It's that is a food activity sitting and watching something for me, so I forget that sometimes that If I was just sitting there oh My god, I got my delicious spread.
[63:56.79]I've got my lunch and my dinner.
[63:58.38]It's right here.
[63:59.00]Oh
[64:00.52]And the person I was watching was just like, talking about, yeah, I get it.
[64:07.87]But then again, I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about.
[64:12.71]And that's it.
[64:13.99]That's all I'm going to say.
[64:16.81]I can't, I'm not going to change it.
[64:20.72]I'm stacking health regen first.
[64:23.33]OPEN CRATES!
[64:26.27]I probably shouldn't have told you guys I was going to do that.
[64:28.57]We're getting all caps OPEN CRATES now.
[64:33.61]I probably shouldn't have even said I was doing that.
[64:39.08]OPEN THOSE CRATES!
[64:40.30]HURRY!
[64:46.54]I will, I will.
[64:47.42]Just chill.
[64:56.53]crates now stop playing this game and gamble already hey by the way when each crate opens we all have to like rub our hands together like this
[65:22.53]Hey, buddy, the blood... Hold on.
[65:25.87]Hey, buddy, the blood trail alters give you buffs.
[65:29.88]I thought it was, okay.
[65:31.06]Well, thank, I appreciate the spoiler.
[65:33.26]Um, I actually kind of do.
[65:36.62]I mean, I like to kind of figure these games out sometimes, but sometimes you really just, this is no way to know what the hell's even going on in these games.
[65:43.45]I thought when I picked up both of those pieces and went to the altar or whatever, that it was going to spawn a hard boss, but it's going to give me an item to help with the boss.
[65:51.69]So I, I guess I'll do it.
[66:09.51]One of these two.
[66:10.01]Can you please put Family Guy clips in the corner?
[66:16.28]No.
[66:21.00]Blue ones are special.
[66:22.07]Wait, which ones?
[66:30.67]Needles is probably better for this exact build right now.
[66:36.23]Wait, I'm playing the new version of the game.
[66:37.89]I forgot the beta is out, right?
[66:39.78]So there is new stuff here.
[66:41.00]Ooh, cool.
[66:42.00]Alright, yeah.
[66:43.04]The beta's out.
[66:43.98]It's in beta.
[66:46.10]There's a bunch of new stuff.
[66:46.76]How can you be so mean to us?
[66:49.92]I'm not.
[66:50.58]You're interpreting me, my... Sorry, I lost something.
[66:58.63]There we go.
[67:03.54]Is this the beta version?
[67:06.33]I imagine so, because I didn't have this light radius thing before.
[67:10.89]You have to subscribe to the beta to access it.
[67:14.91]Oh.
[67:17.29]Well, shit.
[67:17.87]You have to put the game... Oh, you have to go and do the beta change on Steam.
[67:24.88]Well, I'll be playing this again, so it doesn't matter.
[67:27.04]This is a fun game just to kind of play for like a few hours.
[67:29.58]You got caught lying.
[67:32.44]I didn't get caught lying.
[67:33.96]I didn't have correct info.
[67:38.99]I thought that there was a patch to the game that was because it was like, hey, the game's going into beta.
[67:42.79]So I'm like, oh, maybe it's I guess it's in beta.
[67:44.45]Steam auto updates everything.
[67:49.06]Steam is auto updating, right?
[68:05.42]That's not how betas work?
[68:09.38]Alright, the game is an early access game.
[68:11.20]I thought it was just going to be... Hey, we're considered to be in beta now.
[68:16.01]We did an update.
[68:16.61]Takes like five seconds to do it.
[68:24.57]Is it going to mess with my save file?
[68:26.91]Does it make a different save file or can I just do it after this run?
[68:44.72]You'll be fine.
[68:46.44]Yeah, I'll turn it on.
[68:52.73]What pizza topping should you get?
[68:53.85]Pepperoni's easy.
[68:56.45]Doesn't weigh it down.
[68:57.13]I don't like when pizza gets weighed down.
[69:00.41]You pick the thing up and the thing flops over like a fucking, like it's a t-shirt.
[69:03.98]Like coming out of the fucking dryer.
[69:05.44]Like, no.
[69:06.86]No thanks.
[69:13.66]To me, toppings on a pizza should always be... always... ...small enough to be able to not cause a flop problem.
[69:25.57]For instance, Meat Lover's Pizza, I find to be... Just, I... I don't find... I don't want to order it.
[69:32.57]Because it's not a... It's a lasagna.
[69:35.11]Because you're gonna get it out of the bar, you're gonna take the piece out, you're gonna put it on a plate, and it's gonna just be falling apart like a fucking lasagna.
[69:40.61]It's a lasagna.
[69:41.19]Just eat it.
[69:41.75]Just eat a lasagna.
[69:47.33]He's a meat hater.
[69:50.75]No, it's just, it's about weight.
[69:53.17]I love sausage on pizza.
[69:54.69]I love, you know, like hamburger on pizza.
[69:56.33]I like pepperoni on pizza.
[69:57.61]I like bacon on pizza.
[69:58.71]I just don't want all of them on, piled on at the same time.
[70:04.04]It's all about just, you know, distribution.
[70:09.90]Meat haters pizza.
[70:11.32]There's just a bunch of lettuce on it.
[70:20.61]This build sucks.
[70:22.51]It's been five minutes.
[70:26.05]I think I'm doing okay.
[70:31.07]Veggie pizza does go hard.
[70:33.65]I like vegetables on pizza, but again, the same rule applies.
[70:37.77]Peppers and onions.
[70:39.38]Okay.
[70:41.24]Nice.
[70:42.24]Peppers and onions.
[70:44.02]Peppers and onions and olives though.
[70:47.64]No, that's one too many.
[70:51.13]No.
[70:53.99]Peppers and onions.
[70:57.00]Please don't say, go hard.
[70:58.42]He's trying to fit in.
[71:09.00]Does he know that there's tomato sauce on pizza?
[71:14.30]No, I had no idea.
[71:15.38]I thought it was, um...
[71:22.52]That's a Boomer Andy take?
[71:24.53]I don't think so.
[71:25.31]I don't think that's a Boomer take.
[71:35.56]I'm going for defense this time.
[71:46.65]What about flavored crust?
[71:48.75]I think stuffed crust pizza is amazing.
[71:50.97]Something about the way that it bakes inside the dough.
[71:54.07]I don't know why, but it doesn't taste like any other cheese I've ever eaten.
[71:59.55]And I can't, you cannot, it's impossible to replicate.
[72:01.87]It's impossible.
[72:04.71]However stuffed crust pizza gets made, I don't know how.
[72:12.84]But it just tastes so much better than if... I don't know.
[72:17.18]It's like a weird, unique flavor.
[72:19.55]It's really good.
[72:23.59]What's the worst pizza topping?
[72:30.53]Probably ham.
[72:31.85]I don't get... Ham to me is just...
[72:43.99]What do you mean, what, what, what, wrong, wrong?
[72:45.81]I know, but it's just not... A lot of times you get ham on pizza, it's like that cubed ham.
[72:53.29]The cubes.
[72:57.41]I don't really want cubed ham on pizza.
[73:01.45]He does actually hate meat.
[73:03.50]I don't know if you were here three days ago, but I talked about eating corned beef hash out of the can.
[73:12.82]Not in the way that you think.
[73:15.72]I don't... That's not accurate.
[73:17.14]What should I take?
[73:24.07]I'm going to take these and deposit them because this is, like, a tank.
[73:28.05]So... Maybe eventually I can make, like, a tank run.
[73:31.33]I don't know.
[73:37.86]They sell corn befashed in a can?
[73:44.80]I...
[73:46.44]Yeah, that's how you get it.
[73:48.58]Unless you go to a breakfast place and they make it kind of fresh to order.
[73:54.74]The egg hash corned beef hot sauce concoction sounds fucking awesome.
[73:59.04]It's wonderful.
[74:03.11]For those of you that weren't here, I'll tell you again.
[74:06.35]Serving of cornmeal, corned beef hash out of the can.
[74:11.39]You heat it up on the stove.
[74:14.54]Get it nice to exactly where you want it.
[74:17.16]Do one, one like over medium egg or over easy, over however you like it.
[74:21.00]That goes on top.
[74:24.06]You're going to with Tabasco right on top of the egg.
[74:27.68]You're going to have one slice of toast.
[74:31.20]And you're going to have three heirloom tomatoes that have been cooked potentially in the oven.
[74:37.15]You're going to make more than three probably because, you know, you're making this.
[74:44.90]Just nice and slow.
[74:45.86]Low.
[74:47.64]Those tomatoes, you know, you're not trying to cook them.
[74:49.38]You're just trying to kind of heat them up a little.
[74:52.12]That's stoner food?
[74:53.08]No, it is not.
[74:53.64]That is... That is a great breakfast.
[74:56.17]If you go to a breakfast place, they definitely have a corned beef hash meal.
[74:59.21]And it is what I just described to you.
[75:02.23]It is the exact thing I just told you.
[75:19.77]Some of you are going to do it.
[75:21.45]Even if you don't do the tomato part.
[75:23.05]I would say you should probably put something on there that's not just eggs and meat.
[75:32.22]Something to give you a little bit of your vegetable count for the day.
[75:35.70]I'm going to go down.
[75:49.78]Did you add rice to that?
[75:50.68]However you want to make it yours, right?
[75:54.64]Go for it.
[75:56.36]That's just how I do it.
[76:10.39]Bigfoot or Sasquatch?
[76:11.91]Do you confirm or deny?
[76:17.28]Is it Bigfoot or Sasquatch?
[76:18.90]Or is it Bigfoot and Sasquatch?
[76:21.32]What's your question?
[76:23.74]Are you asking if it's Bigfoot or Sasquatch?
[76:26.28]Or are you asking if I think they both exist?
[76:29.40]Like it's two different people.
[76:44.72]Are there any cryptids that you believe in strongly?
[76:52.51]Not necessarily.
[76:53.37]I mean, I do think there's probably stuff in the deep sea that we haven't seen that could be to the level of what you're describing.
[77:01.30]Look at the weird fucking animals that are down there.
[77:03.76]There are animals that have lights on their heads.
[77:07.99]There are some really wacky deep sea creatures.
[77:12.05]We have not really seen it all, so.
[77:17.01]I'm one of those people where if it's kind of possible, then it's possible.
[77:23.02]But I'm not going to sit.
[77:24.52]I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the Loch Ness monster is.
[77:28.44]You know, 10,000 feet deep in the ocean.
[77:30.85]I know it.
[77:31.55]I don't know.
[77:31.93]Maybe possible.
[77:35.09]I don't know.
[77:47.30]Do I think there's a big naked guy walking around in the woods behind your backyard?
[77:53.98]No.
[77:55.51]Not necessarily.
[77:56.79]I don't know.
[78:01.83]Like, do I think there's like a 15-foot hairy naked guy that's walking around just kind of hanging out in the woods?
[78:10.72]I don't think so.
[78:12.00]I could... I don't know.
[78:14.34]I don't know what the answer is.
[78:35.29]If you ever do see Bigfoot... I feel like... I don't know.
[78:41.16]Would Bigfoot just run?
[78:43.26]Oh shit!
[78:44.04]Oh shit, another person saw me!
[78:45.82]Oh, I'm naked and I'm running around!
[78:48.12]Or would Bigfoot be like, listen, I know this is fucked up looking, and I know you know you found me, but let me tell you something.
[78:55.32]I've got a secret bank account.
[78:57.40]In that secret bank account, I've got fucking six million dollars.
[79:01.29]Don't say shit, and I will fucking zelly you the money.
[79:05.35]I'll zelly you fucking ten thousand dollars a day.
[79:07.25]I don't know.
[79:18.66]Is piercing work with the fire?
[79:24.45]He can speak?
[79:26.95]I don't know.
[79:30.05]Scammer Bigfoot.
[79:34.65]You just... Listen.
[79:36.23]Let me tell you something.
[79:37.43]I've got a bank account with 10 million dollars in it.
[79:40.21]All you need to do is you need to send me 50.
[79:43.25]And then I'll send you 10,000 next week.
[79:53.17]Bigfoot's a scammer?
[79:55.60]That's not... That's not what I meant.
[79:59.56]But that's funny.
[80:07.50]You're my favorite popsicle streamer.
[80:14.92]Can we do the email that has not been put in the chat in like six years?
[80:19.48]I think that's what they're referring to.
[80:34.25]Yep, always take that.
[80:35.49]Every time.
[80:35.85]If you're the fire character, it's a quick tip for you.
[80:51.85]Hmm...
[80:56.66]The movement speed is what absolutely killed me last time.
[80:58.70]So I got to focus on it for a little bit.
[81:01.20]I'm never going to play this game.
[81:02.16]Don't give me any tips.
[81:03.54]So let me, I have to tell you, don't say that you're never going to do something.
[81:09.60]Trust me, I'm experienced here.
[81:12.04]Saying you're never going to do something in the one small off chance that you do, that you end up doing that, you're going to think back and go, I should never have said I'm never, ever doing this.
[81:35.16]I'm not though.
[81:39.38]But what if like in like a fucking year you come back and it's like your favorite fucking game dude?
[81:43.18]You never know.
[81:55.38]I want that parchment.
[82:02.16]I will never trust Bigfoot.
[82:06.41]You're calling me Bigfoot.
[82:07.61]Like, oh, Jerma is Bigfoot.
[82:09.64]Jerma is a cryptid.
[82:10.66]He's Bigfoot.
[82:11.92]Don't you guys make fun of how small I am all the time?
[82:16.12]What's going on there?
[82:17.78]There's a lack of consistency.
[82:23.08]Lack of consistency.
[82:25.82]Smallfoot.
[82:36.12]That's not even... That's not even funny.
[82:40.32]That's not... That is so easy.
[82:42.60]Come on.
[82:46.05]You're not Bigfoot.
[82:46.89]You're Smallfoot.
[82:49.65]That's easy.
[82:51.03]That's way too easy.
[83:09.40]Oh, boss.
[83:19.16]That thing is doing a lot of work.
[83:21.99]I'll take this again.
[83:23.49]The boss.
[83:23.81]Alright, back up.
[83:27.91]Did I pick anything?
[83:28.51]Yeah, I did.
[83:28.95]I'm going to deposit the boots.
[83:44.39]There's no way you can be Bigfoot.
[83:45.73]You smell like ranch and there's no ranch in the woods?
[83:54.36]Why can't I just take a bottle of ranch into the woods and drink it in the woods?
[83:58.60]Well, I don't understand the logic behind that.
[84:00.74]There's no ranch in the woods.
[84:02.62]Why can't I just have it in my backpack while I'm walking around?
[84:22.12]Kind of shredded that guy.
[84:32.58]Um.
[84:38.68]I'm not going to use this, but I'd rather deposit these because I want to be able to make a tanky character.
[84:46.48]Why are you not denying that you smell like ranch?
[84:48.42]I don't smell like ranch dressing.
[84:50.72]I don't even like ranch dressing.
[85:03.98]Ranch dressing to me, and you're going to think I'm gross.
[85:10.76]This is the take that a lot of people determine if they like you as a person or not, which is like, relax.
[85:19.77]I think that ranch is just a, it's just to me, I like blue cheese better.
[85:27.93]Anywhere I would be putting ranch, blue cheese is used in that scenario.
[85:38.19]What should I take here?
[85:44.29]Ranch to me is just not quite there.
[85:46.83]And I would prefer blue cheese to be the thing instead of ranch.
[85:52.79]I get that opinion because I'm a huge Buffalo chicken fan.
[85:56.45]Buffalo chicken is probably my favorite food.
[85:59.77]One of the top three favorite foods ever.
[86:02.60]And that combination has just been burned in my brain forever.
[86:16.99]This dude eats crayons.
[86:17.99]He's lying.
[86:19.79]If they're dipped in blue cheese, um... No, don't give him any more.
[86:25.00]Don't give him anything else.
[86:26.40]Don't give him anything else.
[86:28.02]That'll be on, like, Twitter.
[86:31.71]He eats crayons.
[86:33.53]He eats crayons.
[86:35.01]He eats crayons.
[86:36.25]Hey, did you hear?
[86:36.71]He eats fucking crayons today.
[86:40.63]Don't give him anything else.

[87:52.74]Is for like talking to colleagues.
[87:58.21]How come you didn't DM me?
[87:59.21]Because I'm not going to, bro.
[88:13.02]I actually think I had a pretty good one.
[88:14.56]Let me see.
[88:15.96]Let me see.
[88:16.30]Let me look at my notes.
[88:22.71]Let's see.
[88:23.17]Did I have a good one?
[88:28.65]I feel like I'd had one recently.
[88:40.04]Maybe not.
[88:41.92]Really?
[88:44.97]I thought I did.
[88:52.97]Damn.
[88:58.82]I still have the whole Adam Sandler movie notes.
[89:07.45]No, shit.
[89:08.85]I fell off big time, yeah.
[89:12.36]I fell off.
[89:13.62]Absolutely.
[89:14.44]I completely fell off.
[89:17.10]I thought I had a couple of draft tweets for you guys.
[89:21.37]Yeah, I fell off.
[89:23.53]That's alright.
[89:36.94]He's washed up now.
[89:37.88]He's all washed up.
[89:43.08]Hey, I'd rather be all washed up than dirty.
[89:45.00]Hmm?
[89:50.66]Hmm?
[90:04.93]Okay, Dad.
[90:10.17]-2, -2.
[90:11.47]No, no, no.
[90:12.55]Stop that.
[90:13.43]-2, dad.
[90:26.04]Come on.
[90:26.58]That's something that I would be.
[90:30.42]Cry me a river, smallfoot.
[90:35.14]Ban that person for life.
[90:53.45]Execute order number 666.
[91:19.38]Too many.
[91:20.10]Too many Duntas.
[91:21.10]Too many Duntas.
[91:21.88]Too many.
[91:23.50]Too much.
[91:29.93]Somebody's on stage doing that and the whole crowd's like, Too many!
[91:34.23]These are too many of these!
[91:35.19]Stop it!
[91:35.65]Boo!
[91:36.13]Stop!
[91:36.99]Too many!
[91:38.25]Too many!
[91:41.47]This dude's just got the microphone going.
[91:43.25]People get up and leave.
[91:50.76]I know he really he really is just fucking washed up now.
[91:55.30]Yeah, like that was I was awful.
[91:58.70]How many times you do the Star Wars like interlude thing like he fucking fell off.
[92:19.08]Alright, I'm going to the well.
[92:22.92]I can take a lot more hits.
[92:23.70]This is great.
[92:24.74]I'm actually happy about this.
[92:25.54]Alright, well, then magnet.
[92:38.09]I went to Hash House at GoGo recently.
[92:39.77]It was pretty nice.
[92:40.51]This place is great.
[92:45.07]At the lake.
[92:54.91]Alright, I'm depositing the tank boots.
[92:56.81]I think those are going to be better.
[92:58.39]Alright, and then I'm going to do well.
[93:07.50]Then let's do bloodstain first.
[93:10.62]Bloodstain first.
[93:11.26]Because I want to see what that does.
[93:18.38]I need movement speed and damage going forward.
[93:22.88]Really, really, really important.
[93:31.14]Because I'm way too slow right now.
[93:48.41]Whoa, really?
[93:49.67]Double flamethrower?
[93:56.17]Is it a double flamethrower?
[94:00.90]Oh, that's actually kind of insane.
[94:03.98]Alright.
[94:05.30]Attack speed or let's just max this out.
[94:15.63]It's so much worse now.
[94:16.57]That's going to be a boss killer though, I think.
[94:20.87]It should be really good against boss.
[94:28.39]Alright, let's get the first one.
[94:46.69]10, 9, 8.
[94:47.01]Okay.
[94:54.21]Burn chance.
[94:54.73]Alright.
[95:00.65]Now we go to the other side.
[95:01.89]Or should I get the... I'm going to go... While there's still 10 minutes, I'm going to get this first.
[95:07.86]And then we're going to go to the well and then get the second piece.
[95:24.22]Alright, so when I have the full pieces, where do I take it?
[95:27.43]Back to that, say, altar?
[95:34.83]You don't.
[95:35.61]You just hold it.
[95:36.41]Oh, what does it do?
[95:37.25]Alright, I need movement speed now.
[95:42.26]Stop.
[95:43.28]I gotta stop picking stuff that's not movement speed.
[95:45.82]This is becoming a problem.
[96:03.07]You married into it.
[96:03.71]I could go back then.
[96:10.81]Why would you come back then?
[96:11.78]We'd be closed.
[96:24.34]Movement speed.
[96:25.20]Take it.
[96:26.64]Yes, just do it.
[96:27.62]I know the other one's good, but I'm going to get a bunch of levels right now.
[96:30.52]Again, do it again.
[96:34.77]Attack speed.
[96:39.76]Again, moving speed.
[96:49.03]More health.
[97:00.33]more piercing.
[97:04.43]Alright, I don't have to get the magnet anymore because I just got two of them.
[97:16.30]You've been putting it up your whole life, you just don't know it.
[97:20.08]You need to call it.
[97:22.12]I need to know what I stand to win.
[97:24.70]Stand to win everything, call it.
[97:28.32]Well done.
[97:30.58]That is my favorite scene of any movie ever.
[97:33.58]I think it is.
[97:46.26]Look at that.
[97:48.42]Melting.
[97:49.82]And this is an ACT boss.
[97:52.34]Right?
[97:52.60]This is like ACT 2.
[97:55.82]Gone.
[97:56.66]Dead.
[98:07.21]You think Bigfoot would enjoy your screams?
[98:09.20]No, Bigfoot's probably one of the people in here just like talking shit every day.
[98:12.12]I wouldn't be surprised.
[98:26.02]Imagine, like... Okay, you know, like, a lot of, like, the boxing's, like, really kind of coming back?
[98:31.19]Like, a lot of people getting involved in boxing, there's, like, chess boxing, and there's, like, you know, Creator Clash, and, like, there's a lot of, like, boxing events.
[98:40.00]What if somebody boxed Bigfoot, and Bigfoot just beat the ever-living fucking shit out of this person?
[98:50.87]It's like, oh, like, uh, Jerma versus Bigfoot.
[98:53.90]And this- and we- we find somebody that's like, literally fucking eight feet tall, that's like three- four hundred pounds.
[98:59.10]Jacked.
[99:00.14]Unbelievable in unbelievable condition, and I think I can win.
[99:03.70]And I just get the absolute fucking shit beat out of me.
[99:07.44]Like, it's ridiculous.
[99:08.66]It is ridiculous.
[99:12.68]And it shows me, before the fight, signing a bunch of documents saying, DO NOT STOP THIS FIGHT.
[99:18.80]I WILL WIN.
[99:28.98]And he just like picks me up overhead and like throws me into the fucking crowd.
[99:33.98]After like six straight minutes.
[99:38.20]Of like.
[99:42.58]Like tip to my face.
[99:55.08]And then just zoom in on some people in the front row that are holding stacks of money.
[100:00.36]With cigars in their mouths, cheering.
[100:02.32]Because it's like, oh my god, this was free money!
[100:04.68]This was so much fucking- I- I- This was so free.
[100:19.07]No, I'm-
[100:28.33]Why would you lose?
[100:29.39]Because that's funny.
[100:32.69]I don't even want to throw one punch.
[100:36.76]I want to taunt in the ring when the bell rings and then it's just me being hit in the head over and over again.
[100:51.21]I go out to the other side of the ring and I'm picking up like objects to hit him with.
[100:55.01]Like this is illegal, like.
[100:57.43]Like, it's over.
[100:57.87]The fight's over.
[100:58.61]I've been disqualified.
[101:00.17]I'm picking up, like, mic stands and trying to hit him in the fucking head with it and stuff.
[101:03.41]Like, I've already lost.
[101:04.75]I've been disqualified.
[101:21.06]It's personal at this point.
[101:25.65]This is a Yakuza sub story.
[101:37.40]No, I'll never truly step into the ring.
[101:41.63]I couldn't.
[101:44.31]All the medical problems I still have, no.
[101:46.17]It's a fun little thing to think about, but no.
[102:04.25]I really want to just stand still right here.
[102:07.65]Oh, I can't.
[102:08.15]Fuck.
[102:11.05]Shit.
[102:11.35]Alright, alright.
[102:11.99]I've got four minutes.
[102:12.71]Don't lose it now.
[102:13.29]Where's my movement speed?
[102:18.53]Pause at the tank boots and we gotta go.
[102:19.69]Oh, wait.
[102:20.11]The other bloodstain.
[102:21.26]I'll do that right now.
[102:23.04]Am I going the right way?
[102:26.94]It's not here.
[102:39.72]There's so much shit here.
[102:40.68]I can't get it all.
[102:43.80]How do I feel?
[102:44.40]I still feel like I'm so slow.
[102:45.83]Alright, get in the ring with Bigfoot and it's like a big deal.
[103:07.36]We do weigh-ins.
[103:11.59]Yeah, let's take a look.
[103:14.45]Bigfoot has about 40 inches of reach on Jerma985, which is not surprising.
[103:37.94]Only 40?
[103:38.56]I don't know.
[103:40.73]I don't know much about how that works.
[103:46.51]Alright, there's the other piece.
[103:47.29]Come into my eye.
[103:51.64]Come on, get out of my eye.
[104:01.77]Alright, I got the whole thing now.
[104:03.43]So now what?
[104:04.87]What does this do for me now?
[104:05.63]Do I have to do anything special or just fight the boss with it on?
[104:12.27]Looking for health and movement speed.
[104:16.47]Just fight the boss, okay.
[104:28.02]You're never going to open crates.
[104:29.82]We're going to do it after this?
[104:31.91]Whatever happens in this run.
[104:41.56]Base damage.
[104:43.00]Yeah.
[104:44.34]So short.
[104:44.80]There's money down here.
[105:01.80]Okay, I think, like I said, I'm one of the tank boots.
[105:03.88]I think that's an interesting thing to build.
[105:08.70]Oh, health?
[105:09.06]Holy shit.
[105:09.50]Alright, alright, alright.
[105:10.34]There's no excuse now.
[105:11.12]If I see movement speed, I have to get it.
[105:13.86]Doesn't matter what else is up there.
[105:23.84]I still feel like I'm a little too slow, but I'll concentrate.
[105:26.34]I'll try.
[105:38.64]Oh, geez.
[105:43.95]This is the boss killer build right now.
[105:45.77]It's not the clear waves build.
[105:47.47]Ooh.
[105:48.95]Head this way quick.
[105:51.89]Oh, get it all.
[105:52.59]Attack speed, damage.
[105:57.58]Yes.
[105:59.68]Movement speed.
[106:07.46]Uh, crit chance or attack speed?
[106:16.59]Alright, that's going to be it.
[106:25.84]Hope this is enough.
[106:39.08]Shit.
[106:39.52]No!
[106:39.86]It's hard to see.
[106:43.79]Put the fire in front of me.
[106:50.31]Healing potion.
[107:00.82]Oh my god.
[107:07.18]Moving speed or health?
[107:08.77]Health.
[107:15.15]What the fuck?
[107:15.89]He's dead.
[107:16.43]I killed him.
[107:18.39]He's already dead.
[107:21.69]What did so much damage?
[107:36.58]Something hurt a lot.
[107:46.48]Whoa.
[107:46.96]Trying to keep him close.
[108:00.83]Not that close though.
[108:17.03]Oh, the item.
[108:17.83]That's right.
[108:18.55]Ooh.
[108:20.51]You survived and I got the item.
[108:21.99]It's the item.
[108:22.59]Holy shit.
[108:23.11]That thing is incredible.
[108:28.58]Thanks for telling me that.
[108:36.52]Unlock trait type.
[108:38.01]Spin and puncture.
[108:40.13]Money.
[108:40.39]And then the rat ring.
[108:43.87]Cool.
[108:46.65]Very nice.
[108:51.37]Is it available to buy?
[108:52.31]Or is it just now in the item pool?
[109:00.02]Cool.
[109:01.70]I think I'm getting ready to be able to do the second level.
[109:04.84]What is this one?
[109:06.14]Level 100.
[109:06.32]Kill 50,000 enemies with effects.
[109:12.93]Alright, so this character is... All the upgrades are available.
[109:17.09]Everything is available.
[109:17.73]It's just money now.
[109:22.84]Cool.
[109:25.12]Alright, let's open some crates in TF2.
[109:28.98]Probably only going to be live for another 30-40 minutes.
[109:31.88]I know this is a short one, but... Yeah, I'm just streaming when I can.
[109:35.92]And when I think I feel like it.
[109:37.68]And when I think I'm having a good time.
[109:39.77]So... Here we are.
[109:44.25]It's time to gamble.
[109:46.19]Gamble!
[109:51.91]I'm not going to buy these yet because I don't know which one I want.
[109:54.69]Alright, I'm going to just take a quick pee break.
[109:57.58]When I come back, we'll open some crates.
[109:59.16]We can examine them.
[110:00.28]See if they're any good.
[110:01.68]I've only got like 20 keys.
[110:03.56]I know that's a lot, but I don't want to overdo it.
[110:07.22]I'm just trying to clear out some of the old cases that I have.
[110:10.71]We'll see.
[110:12.29]I'll be right back.
