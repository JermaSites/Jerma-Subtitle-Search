[00:03.77]Fenrir, do you have an ult?
[00:04.99]Yes, you do.
[00:05.79]Please use it.
[00:06.55]But Marder's here.
[00:07.03]Marder's behind me.
[00:11.85]You brought him to me!
[00:12.69]What are you doing, Fenrir?
[00:14.31]What are you doing?
[00:14.97]You put him on me!
[00:17.39]Did he?
[00:21.11]Yeah, he, like, brought the baby on me!
[00:26.42]And then he just, like, dashed out of there.
[00:27.94]Bad doggy.
[00:29.02]Fuck.
[00:31.64]Bad doggy.
[00:33.53]He put him on me!
[00:35.21]One shot!
[00:35.97]I'm dead!
[00:37.79]Here you go!
[00:39.73]Look what I brought you!
[00:40.83]You told him to ult!
[00:43.17]Yeah, not on me!
[00:49.32]Fuck!
[00:49.52]We got speedball.
[00:50.48]Oh, you found him?
[00:51.12]It really takes that long.
[00:53.08]It takes a looong time.
[00:55.52]Is Vamana dead?
[00:56.22]He's big baby.
[00:57.58]It looks like he's probably gonna die.
[00:59.42]Yeah.
[01:03.84]What the fuck?
[01:07.18]It's like you get stuck on your wall.
[01:11.60]I wasn't quick enough.
[01:16.05]That guy murders me.
[01:17.37]Alright, GG.
[01:19.27]Nope.
[01:23.72]Missed.
[01:25.16]Well, you fucked yourself.
[01:27.52]You may as come around that way.
[01:33.14]Oh, he doesn't know where you are.
[01:34.52]He's looking like behind him.
[01:36.42]He doesn't know where you like went.
[01:38.30]He's looking around.
[01:41.56]Wow.
[01:46.21]What the fuck?
[01:46.93]You're dead.
[01:47.89]What the fuck?
[01:48.79]How are you alive?
[01:52.61]How are you alive?
[01:55.83]Oh, my God.
[01:56.65]This bitch.
[01:58.73]Maybe I didn't know where I went.
[02:03.50]Was he confused?
[02:04.46]Seriously, your melee was like looking around like, what the, what, what?
[02:07.38]Your melee can teleport, what?
[02:09.96]I didn't know.
[02:12.58]This is the first time I've played this game in nine months.
[02:14.82]I knew this didn't hit you with one tick of anything.
[02:18.62]No, he ulted me.
[02:20.40]He might have scratched you with one hit of the beam.
[02:22.48]Like, that was it.
[02:24.78]Come on, is that?
[02:31.07]Oh, the joke's on you, Anubis.
[02:33.07]I think.
[02:34.57]Ouchie.
[02:34.97]Do you have a stun?
[02:42.89]Thanks.
[02:47.90]Ow!
[02:48.20]No shot!
[02:48.70]Oh no!
[02:49.38]This guy's a man.
[02:51.06]Oh no!
[02:52.44]I couldn't shot in time.
[02:53.94]I was knocked up.
[02:56.76]How'd you kill this fucker?
[02:57.93]You don't die!
[03:01.75]This is ridiculous!
[03:06.55]He's not dying!
[03:08.11]Fucking hell!
[03:10.05]What?!
[03:12.09]He had 10% health for fucking 30 seconds!
[03:17.96]Oh my god!
[03:21.02]That was ridiculous!
[03:23.10]Fred.
[03:23.72]Yeah.
[03:24.92]You weren't supposed to buy that yet.
[03:26.80]Shit.
[03:27.26]Yeah, you weren't supposed to buy that after it was a funny joke.
[03:32.27]They're both missing.
[03:34.87]I don't know, I have no idea.
[03:35.87]Nooo, I suck!
[03:39.27]Why?
[03:40.09]Because I wasted my ult on nothing.
[03:43.09]Why?
[03:43.73]Because Kronos was there, and he saw me coming, so I wasted my ult.
[03:47.04]Oh, you're far up, huh?
[03:48.66]Woah!
[03:49.46]Jeeva's behind me!
[03:51.00]Help me!
[03:52.40]Look where you are!
[03:54.42]I have speed buff, I stole it.
[03:55.76]I'm so fast, they can't catch me.
[03:58.96]Come, Oranboo!
[04:01.53]Oh, the archers are gonna murder me now.
[04:03.09]Are they still chasing you?
[04:04.19]Alright, press B. Right now.
[04:08.28]Whoa!
[04:12.86]Thorn landed on my head.
[04:13.76]Oh, I missed.
[04:15.48]What froze me?
[04:16.18]Okay, press 1, Jerma.
[04:17.81]Use your dashie.
[04:18.69]No, I used this!
[04:21.69]Kill Bill Kennen any second.
[04:28.33]Yes.
[04:30.07]No, I used this.
[04:31.74]...cool down didn't have any, but they just fit with each other so well.
[04:41.32]Whee.
[04:52.96]No, we rebound.
[04:54.06]Asshole.
[04:54.68]I don't know where Zebulonk is.
[04:56.30]He's the only one over here.
[05:00.83]I'm getting death done.
[05:02.89]Oh, I'm DPS'd!
[05:06.29]Help me!
[05:13.85]Oh, baby!
[05:14.97]Oh, I killed you.
[05:16.29]No!
[05:17.53]Oh, it's dark.
[05:19.84]Sorry I, like, sacrificed you there, Brett.
[05:29.56]Yikes.
[05:31.04]No, Freya, we're best guard in the game, easily.
[05:36.18]She's up there, she does a ton of damage.
[05:39.33]She killed me, so she's best in the game.
[05:41.25]Oh, boom.
[05:44.76]Well, are you, like, surprised I actually killed something?
[05:48.50]No.
[05:49.54]I'm surprised how much damage that did.
[05:50.90]Where'd you pull that one out from, Boo?
[05:52.10]Good.
[05:52.70]You've been practicing.
[05:54.92]I can tell you're playing a lot with Anubis shit.
[05:58.00]Jesus.
[05:58.32]That just did a lot of damage to him.
[06:02.48]Ooh, Boo, you did it.
[06:03.32]Good for you.
[06:03.78]Good job.
