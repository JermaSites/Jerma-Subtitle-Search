[ve:61.1.100]

[00:00.03]Thank you.
[00:45.54]what is up how are you welcome to hell what did you do welcome back we are back again this nice bright sunny Sunday we're going to continue bioforge remember from last night I uh soft locked myself out of continuing
[01:15.48]I have, off stream, gotten back to where we were supposed to be.
[01:21.65]And we're going to continue.
[01:31.72]I'm going to get my iced tea ready.
[01:34.50]Having an iced tea.
[01:38.14]A little lemon, you know.
[01:41.06]A little.
[01:45.15]So let's get rid of the pre-rolls.
[01:47.35]Run some advertisements.
[01:51.03]Like we typically do.
[01:54.14]And we'll get started.
[02:04.89]Sweet or unsweet tea?
[02:06.19]It is sweetened.
[02:08.07]I don't really like sweet tea.
[02:10.06]I think it's too much.
[02:20.26]Yeah, yeah.
[02:25.77]I think sweet tea is just kind of going, I'd say 20 to 30% over what I like.
[02:33.32]It's 30% too sweet.
[02:42.64]Honestly, you know what?
[02:43.40]I love brisk iced tea.
[02:46.57]And you would think that a brisk iced tea... I'm talking about the little blue cans.
[02:49.33]The blue and yellow cans.
[02:51.22]Those you think, oh my god, it's probably a million grams of sugar in it.
[02:54.74]It's less than Coke.
[02:55.98]Less than Sprite.
[02:56.82]I think it's only like what?
[02:57.68]20?
[02:57.96]18?
[02:59.53]Which is a lot.
[03:03.01]But... Oh yeah, it's 18.
[03:06.42]Let's see.
[03:06.72]No, no, no.
[03:07.34]I think it's lower than that.
[03:09.14]Let's see.
[03:09.50]Brisk iced tea nutrition.
[03:15.35]Can.
[03:19.00]17 grams of sugar in a 12 ounce can of brisk iced tea, which considering there's like 37 or 34 in a Coke or a Pepsi, right?
[03:33.37]That's like half of what's in sodas.
[03:35.19]20 is not a lot.
[03:41.42]I, eh, no, I mean, guys, you know that you want to hear something crazy?
[03:48.25]The, the USDA or some other agency.
[03:52.91]I don't know.
[03:54.47]One of those government food things has stated that for an adult man in the United States, I believe it's 38 grams of sugar a day is what you are supposed to take in.
[04:09.33]That's like one and a half cans of Coke.
[04:12.45]Think about that.
[04:15.05]The FDA.
[04:15.68]Yeah.
[04:17.80]Even one can of Coke is like you're getting close to your entire day.
[04:27.60]No, it's like 50, dude.
[04:29.18]It is not 50.
[04:31.81]Why would I say that if I... What is the FDA recommended sugar a day?
[04:47.77]50 gram, what?
[04:48.55]This has changed.
[04:49.53]They made it higher.
[04:56.46]They changed it.
[04:58.26]38 grams.
[05:03.32]Ah, hold on a second.
[05:04.30]The American Heart Association.
[05:06.89]The American Heart Association recommends that men limit their daily intake of sugar to no more than 36 grams a day.
[05:15.53]The American Heart Association, I trust.
[05:28.57]This is a Berenstain Bears moment.
[05:33.64]No, I just read it from the American Heart Association web query thing.
[05:55.69]Ben Franklin believed in 50 grams a day.
[05:57.81]I believe him.
[05:59.94]I don't... Okay, Ben Franklin would probably tell you... First of all, sit down.
[06:07.03]That's what he'd say first.
[06:10.56]Ben Franklin would probably say... That... Don't eat a whole pint of ice cream.
[06:18.53]But you could do it sometimes.
[06:22.11]You know what I mean?
[06:25.76]That's my philosophy.
[06:27.64]Here's my philosophy.
[06:30.37]Don't eat a whole pint of ice cream.
[06:33.05]But you can do it sometimes.
[06:35.80]You know?
[06:38.61]Don't drink a whole two liter of coke.
[06:41.67]What are you doing?
[06:44.20]But if you want a big ass coke sometimes, let's go.
[06:56.81]Just don't drink a big ass coke every single day of your whole life.
[07:05.59]Ben Franklin did not know what ice cream was.
[07:08.51]He was too busy inventing it.
[07:15.35]Hold on, this is a Ben Franklin quote.
[07:18.37]I'm gonna read this in Ben Franklin's voice.
[07:23.20]Can sweetening our tea, and with sugar, be a circumstance of such absolute necessity?
[07:29.23]Can the petty pleasure thence arising to the taste compensate for so much misery produced among our fellow creatures?
[07:35.92]And such a constant butchery of the human species by this pestilential detestable traffic in the bodies and souls of men?
[07:46.47]Yeah!
[07:49.44]I would have been in the back screaming, yeah!
[07:59.48]Get the hairpiece and do it.
[08:08.24]Dude, I... It would be... If we could... Okay.
[08:15.27]I kind of wish that, like, normal clothes was back with, like, oh, we had the canes and big hair and big white wigs and... And we had pouted faces and... Excuse me, sir!
[08:38.82]If you go to the bank like that, people are going to be like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
[08:44.51]I would like to make a small deposit, please, of 27 pennies, one nickel, and a handful of quarters.
[08:55.44]Oh, good sir, I do say the weather is fantastic today.
[09:00.01]Oh, yeah, tip the hat to you for that one, sir.
[09:02.65]Oh, have you had biscuits?
[09:04.98]I love those.
[09:06.53]I think.
[09:07.59]This is a different country, but I don't care.
[09:09.93]I'm American and I'm new.
[09:13.31]I'm a new American man.
[09:27.15]Anyways.
[09:32.85]Hey, dude, you're too loud.
[09:35.76]Is that better?
[09:41.09]Is that better?
[09:47.86]Hey dude, stop adding dude to the messages.
[09:51.04]That person said dude.
[09:56.11]Anyways, welcome back.
[09:57.89]Look where we are.
[09:58.69]We're good to go.
[09:59.49]I have the gun again.
[10:03.34]I'm ready.
[10:07.28]I'm going to have multiple save slots.
[10:08.72]We're doing Bio Forge.
[10:11.58]Let's get this out of the way.
[10:23.05]Pretty sick.
[10:25.37]Don't stop adding dude.
[10:30.12]Alright, cool.
[10:31.72]Alright, so I have to.
[10:33.06]I have to, and I, by the way, I would like a round of applause from me.
[10:40.54]Because if you look at the screen, I did a little cleanup and it looks a lot better, doesn't it?
[10:48.35]I made the screen better.
[10:50.08]I made it so it wasn't off to the center.
[10:52.14]I deserve a round of applause.
[11:03.83]I'm in a weird mood today.
[11:05.03]Alright.
[11:05.67]I'm sorry.
[11:07.17]I don't, I don't know.
[11:07.97]I just am.
[11:09.09]Alright.
[11:09.33]So here we go.
[11:09.77]I need to, here's what I did.
[11:11.18]This is what happened last time.
[11:12.96]Let's teleport back to, oh fuck.
[11:19.30]He didn't even see me.
[11:19.93]We're good.
[11:21.13]Alright.
[11:21.43]So what I did last time that was wrong is I went here.
[11:25.61]I need to go apparently so I don't soft lock myself out of the game.
[11:32.40]I need to go up here.
[11:34.57]to floor one.
[11:36.71]Please secure all sidearms.
[11:40.02]Energy discharges in this chamber are extremely hazardous.
[11:43.96]He looked up a guide.
[11:44.72]I mean, I'm Guide Gary.
[11:47.26]That's fine.
[11:49.73]Alright, and I didn't go out here last time because I thought this was dangerous, and it is.
[11:53.55]So what we're going to do is we're going to use the environment to our advantage.
[12:00.92]I hope that doesn't kill me.
[12:01.62]Okay, hold on.
[12:06.08]That's getting closer.
[12:08.38]I gotta get the angle right.
[12:11.29]Dude!
[12:15.39]Let's give it up for Guide Gary.
[12:18.08]Alright, now how do I get that one?
[12:20.28]Off this wall?
[12:27.92]Oh.
[12:28.40]Oh.
[12:33.77]Oh shit!
[12:34.53]Okay, be careful.
[12:35.41]That hurt.
[12:35.87]That did a lot of damage.
[12:36.75]That did way too much damage.
[12:37.58]Um... What if I... I have to bounce it.
[12:45.45]I'm gonna go to the other side?
[12:47.99]I'm gonna bounce it.
[12:48.49]Yeah, we'll do it like this.
[12:59.93]One of these is gonna come back and hit me in the face.
[13:04.08]That almost went all the way.
[13:05.12]There it is.
[13:12.57]OK alright alright.
[13:14.79]But now this is new content.
[13:18.32]I should heal.
[13:18.82]I'm gonna heal.
[13:22.44]Save it.
[13:24.33]And just in case.
[13:26.79]Just in case.
[13:29.81]Something goes... terribly wrong.
[13:32.50]I'm making a new save file at 3.
[13:34.18]And we're gonna name it... Elevator.
[13:44.53]Okay.
[13:46.09]I'm ready, let's go.
[13:49.16]What the fuck?
[13:49.70]There's more?
[13:51.08]What is going on?
[13:51.64]There's more?
[13:54.36]Dude, what?
[13:56.69]That's fuckin' horseshit!
[13:59.53]I did all that to get shot eight times.
[14:01.61]Um, okay.
[14:03.69]I... Can they see me from... Can they see me?
[14:17.51]Oh, fuck!
[14:18.27]That's in the elevator!
[14:25.02]Good.
[14:31.79]Come on.
[14:33.48]Ooh, one of those hit.
[14:43.12]Ow!
[14:44.45]Fuck.
[14:51.15]There was an... I didn't even see the other one.
[14:59.04]I'm gonna end up killing myself.
[15:00.26]It's not gonna be good.
[15:06.37]Ow!
[15:07.23]Okay.
[15:09.06]Okay, there's only one more.
[15:14.83]I am so messed up right now.
[15:16.37]I'm so hurt.
[15:21.06]That's not... What the fuck?
[15:23.08]How is he not right there?
[15:31.53]Should I restart?
[15:35.34]I should probably restart.
[15:36.76]Right?
[15:37.06]Because look at how I'm so injured and I have no heals.
[15:41.22]That's going to take all my energy.
[15:42.68]I'm going to restart.
[15:46.05]Restart.
[15:46.41]Restart.
[15:46.73]Restart.
[15:47.49]Reload.
[15:49.03]I'm not... I don't want to get... The whole point of this is not to get soft locked again.
[16:00.02]Tower to control room.
[16:00.48]The main gun is offline.
[16:02.65]Here we go.
[16:09.32]Dude, I planned that.
[16:21.38]Stop saying dude.
[16:23.44]Whatever.
[16:25.76]How?
[16:26.94]How?
[16:33.97]Better than last time.
[16:41.10]Holy.
[16:41.74]Look at that.
[16:42.48]It went all the way over there.
[16:49.07]Where is this guy in space?
[16:52.36]Right?
[16:53.02]Because... Where is he?
[16:56.08]I don't get what's going on here.
[16:58.75]How can it...
[17:06.55]Alright.
[17:08.14]Better than last time.
[17:08.88]I'm a little messed up.
[17:10.08]I kind of have half HP.
[17:20.27]Boom.
[17:20.75]Alright.
[17:21.27]How much health do I have?
[17:24.55]That's fine.
[17:25.33]That's alright.
[17:25.87]That's not going to softlock me.
[17:30.86]Full health.
[17:32.40]I'm going to save this at four because I don't trust that I did that well enough.
[17:45.30]I don't know.
[17:50.87]What do I do?
[18:01.28]Who's this?
[18:06.11]Do I kill this guy?
[18:08.25]I mean, no.
[18:14.73]I'm using this thing.
[18:17.11]Can I shoot him with this?
[18:21.86]How do I use this thing?
[18:25.27]What do you mean offline?
[18:31.86]Turn it on.
[18:36.85]Turn it on.
[18:39.77]Turn this on.
[18:45.24]Turn it on.
[18:47.66]See?
[18:51.83]You guys thought I was crazy.
[18:56.47]What?
[19:01.72]Turn it on.
[19:09.09]What's that?
[19:29.32]They're shooting their own base.
[19:33.16]What?
[19:35.62]You're gonna destroy your own base?
[19:39.79]What's wrong with you?
[19:48.54]Give me a break.
[19:55.87]Turn that gun on.
[19:56.77]Hurry up.
[20:02.31]No, I... It's gonna hit me.
[20:07.60]Turn the gun on.
[20:09.88]You listen here.
[20:10.46]You get that gun turned on.
[20:11.96]Ow!
[20:16.65]Turn it on!
[20:23.30]Hurry up.
[20:31.99]Now get out of the way after you do this.
[20:41.40]Alright, now watch out.
[20:46.40]This guy could literally kill me right now.
[20:47.97]Okay, how do I shoot the gun?
[20:50.83]How do you shoot it?
[20:53.87]Oh.
[20:56.78]Come on.
[21:09.72]I missed?
[21:20.38]Oh my... That's got to hit, right?
[21:28.01]Got it.
[21:31.27]See you later, dude.
[21:41.28]Oh shit!
[21:43.28]Get on, get on it, get on it!
[21:56.66]Am I not hitting it?
[22:06.67]Yeah!
[22:17.44]I'm sorry I had to kill you, but I must admit, I'm enjoying the silence.
[22:24.65]GG.
[22:24.81]Oh!
[22:27.28]I'm sorry.
[22:33.09]Do you have any jewels on you?
[22:35.19]No, don't put the gun down, you idiot.
[22:38.53]I don't think he had anything.
[22:41.28]Alright, so, because I did that...
[22:44.36]The problem that happened last night will not happen.
[22:50.11]So let's save it.
[22:51.73]I'm gonna save it at 5, just in case.
[22:54.83]I don't know what I'm doing here.
[22:55.65]So now I shouldn't be soft-locked anymore.
[23:13.13]Oh.
[23:13.37]Well, I better get over there, right?
[23:39.62]Okay, so now if I go here, I should be good to go now.
[23:46.51]Next episode, yeah.
[23:51.43]Okay, so every major thing that happens I'm going to run the credits and you can just put like an anime intro at the end of it and an anime intro in the beginning.
[24:01.06]Oh!
[24:07.07]Wait, we need an intro.
[24:18.23]Oh, shit.
[24:18.97]Hold on.
[24:19.46]Just don't start the music yet.
[24:25.10]There it is.
[24:25.68]Start the music now.
[24:30.53]I've got to get down into the elevator.
[24:35.28]Third floor.
[24:36.54]Where would I have to go next?
[24:43.29]That doctor was calling.
[24:47.29]welcome to bioforge episode three the doctor is in oh turn that off turn that off turn it off I don't want to do that no no no turn that I this is going to make everybody die turn it off turn it off turn it off turn it off I'm just running
[25:18.87]There we go.
[25:19.69]There you are.
[25:25.45]Come in.
[25:28.84]You have no choice in the matter, I assure you.
[25:34.53]Am I good?
[25:37.15]This is where he says, you.
[25:38.27]What did I say?
[25:44.68]You do not recognize me, but we have already met.
[26:00.58]I'm still thinking about that Warcraft 3 custom game cutscene comment.
[26:30.77]What system is this on?
[26:31.75]This is on... I think it's on a couple things.
[26:36.48]But this is on DOS.
[26:38.79]Or it's on DOSBox.
[26:41.19]I got the game on GOG.
[26:42.54]The GOG version of the game.
[26:53.33]my background changed to something like bing wallpaper made my background something else right now and it was it's weird because it matches the game it's freaking me out this prisoner is under my control
[27:18.75]I get the battery, though.
[27:23.75]That's good.
[27:27.74]Sorry.
[27:31.20]I'm sorry!
[27:39.45]You made me do it.
[27:40.89]I have no control over my own actions right now.
[27:44.75]I'll see you in heaven.
[27:46.80]We'll talk about it.
[27:50.49]for an instrument of unimaginable power.
[27:55.81]Free of all responsibility for your actions.
[28:00.94]I would have killed her with free will too.
[28:02.74]I don't know, maybe.
[28:05.83]You are the first of the line.
[28:13.31]Here is the second.
[28:15.88]Soon he will join you.
[28:18.54]He will be as you are now.
[28:20.90]Okay, so this is where we left off last time.
[28:39.32]I was softlocked, not anymore.
[28:41.04]I lost my gun, but it's okay.
[28:51.34]The last... Okay, so I can open up this guy and get the battery.
[28:56.41]What's my battery at right now?
[28:58.49]Okay, I'm going to use all of my battery and I'm going to swap it with his.
[29:02.50]So I'm at full health.
[29:04.20]Give me your battery.
[29:10.79]I hope that doesn't have any repercussions because I just killed him.
[29:24.35]Okay.
[29:25.13]So now, take a look at that.
[29:27.99]I got a full mana bar, full health bar.
[29:30.63]This old shit battery, we, whatever.
[29:33.20]Don't need it.
[29:34.82]I don't think, can I store it?
[29:39.40]I don't think I can.
[29:44.11]So that's all I can do in here.
[29:46.01]Now, I don't think those soldiers outside are going to be there anymore.
[29:52.38]Because I blew up the ship.
[29:54.74]Health pack.
[29:56.18]Cool.
[29:58.89]Store it.
[30:02.03]Let's take the flute out just in case I need it.
[30:06.30]Save the game right here.
[30:08.34]And I'm going to save it at... I don't know what any of these mean.
[30:11.83]How about at... How about two?
[30:16.11]Two is the original save that I had softlocked.
[30:18.88]I'm going to save over two.
[30:28.57]We are ready.
[30:33.72]So, I am gonna leave... Wait, what's this?
[30:43.33]Some lore bullshit in here?
[30:45.69]Somebody can read this?
[30:55.74]If you're watching the VOD, you can just kind of pause and read.
[31:06.95]I usually like.
[31:07.79]OK, here's the thing.
[31:08.51]I know I'm like the lore skip guy and I just I don't want to read those six pages is too long for me.
[31:14.80]I will actually read lore.
[31:16.48]I will sit there and read it.
[31:19.48]Just not right now.
[31:27.81]OK.
[31:27.95]So now I need to go.
[31:31.04]Where do I go from here?
[31:32.84]I'm going to go this way I guess.
[31:45.44]Uh, Polly just told me.
[31:48.14]She just said, be prepared.
[31:49.00]There's 12 log books you have to read in this next room.
[31:57.85]I'm gonna beat this guy with a fluke.
[32:12.09]Don't let- I'm on the stairs.
[32:13.33]Get off the stairs.
[32:13.97]This is a shit place to be.
[32:22.65]Go ahead and try that.
[32:25.39]Still want to fight me after seeing that?
[32:29.27]Off the stairs, man.
[32:30.58]And I landed it.
[32:33.18]You can't do stuff like that.
[32:45.39]There we go.
[32:46.81]What is he holding?
[32:47.65]Is he holding a camera?
[33:05.04]As you go down.
[33:16.15]Die!
[33:16.63]I've kicked this guy so many times.
[33:37.67]He's so bloody.
[33:40.56]What?
[33:47.17]Okay.
[33:50.77]Is he implying that that death was not... Holy shit, do you guys think I'm the fucking crazy guy saying... Look at this.
[34:00.28]Logbook.
[34:01.16]Okay, apparently I gotta read this.
[34:09.67]So what is it?
[34:10.55]A security breach of the airlock has occurred to reestablish base integrity.
[34:14.37]The airlock has been resealed.
[34:16.35]The new locking pattern is in the positive O-ring configuration.
[34:20.50]The grid is in XY emulation mode.
[34:23.90]Somebody screenshot that, please.
[34:32.65]Okay, anything else?
[34:34.31]A logbook.
[34:35.43]Maybe I should take it with me.
[34:36.25]Alright, so there's a lot of screens in here I gotta read.
[34:38.29]I'm gonna take it slow.
[34:41.21]This screen right here.
[34:43.03]Reactor.
[34:44.48]Monitor.
[34:56.62]Cell Z. I don't know.
[34:59.91]17.8 meters.
[35:08.01]Reactor access code 135.
[35:09.67]Write that down.
[35:18.96]17 minutes.
[35:20.52]Write that down.
[35:22.57]Okay.
[35:31.84]Data log.
[35:35.44]Order to main airlock.
[35:36.65]Ventilation system problem.
[35:37.85]Temperature rising above normal environment range.
[35:39.77]Air circulator... Okay, should we repair it?
[35:58.76]I don't know.
[36:07.54]He's so fucked he can't read.
[36:09.62]Stop swearing in my chat.
[36:18.86]Mission calendar.
[36:22.42]Okay, I don't think I have to do this.
[36:30.73]Oh!
[36:32.64]Satellite view.
[36:38.47]Do I have to do anything with this?
[36:39.23]Nope.
[36:52.11]Easy.
[36:59.46]What about this one?
[37:04.30]Nope.
[37:07.28]Go back to the 12 computer room.
[37:10.96]Is this the 12 computer room?
[37:14.17]I didn't look down here yet.
[37:17.61]This cabinet's over here?
[37:18.51]Hold on.
[37:21.18]Oh, put this book down.
[37:28.29]Any of these do anything?
[37:34.50]Hey, VOD watchers, skip two episodes.
[37:37.50]That's how you can tell you're not a real anime fan.
[37:40.92]You suffer through the filler four episodes to get to the giant battle.
[37:45.43]Fake fan.
[37:48.41]Icarus data.
[37:54.34]Particular craft is also outfitted with a completely airtight, pressurized wind and heat-resistant canopy.
[38:03.30]Oh!
[38:04.34]Access.
[38:06.65]I thought I just fell down to my death.
[38:07.75]Oh god.
[38:12.55]Is there a gun?
[38:31.77]No, let him near me, come on.
[38:33.03]I need full health for this next part.
[38:40.70]He won't come in here!
[38:45.43]Get over here!
[38:51.00]What is he holding?
[38:54.64]Shit!
[39:02.91]He's got a stapler, man.
[39:04.41]He's got a stapler.
[39:08.85]Tell me.
[39:12.96]Shit!
[39:16.86]No!
[39:31.48]He's got me in the Mortal Kombat sweep.
[39:34.24]That's the worst thing to be in.
[39:38.75]This guy did so way too much damage to me.
[39:40.53]This is unbelievable.
[39:45.78]This guy's kicking my ass.
[39:54.95]Go down!
[40:00.75]Oh, come on, man.
[40:01.87]Am I dead?
[40:03.50]Oh, don't say that like a... Alright, where am I?
[40:16.63]We are ready.
[40:19.63]No, wait, did I save it?
[40:26.40]It's two, right?
[40:38.15]Oh, shit.
[40:39.05]I'm all the way back here.
[40:40.09]Okay.
[40:41.05]Alright, alright.
[40:41.67]I'll... Damn it!
[40:42.53]Okay.
[40:53.49]Restart the episode.
[40:55.27]Alright.
[41:02.94]Kicks only.
[41:08.86]I'm not even in combat mode!
[41:10.38]What the fuck?
[41:32.04]Good start.
[41:35.44]Good start.
[41:37.26]Clean.
[41:39.22]Clean.
[41:43.61]Clean.
[41:45.09]Clean.
[41:49.40]Clean.
[41:50.94]Good.
[41:52.80]Slow down, slow down.
[41:54.89]Good.
[41:56.11]Good.
[41:57.37]Good.
[41:59.86]Good.
[42:01.24]Good.
[42:04.44]Good.
[42:07.10]Good.
[42:11.68]Got him.
[42:12.24]Okay, the gun is on the body of this guard?
[42:19.92]Is it actually?
[42:23.98]I got the log.
[42:24.62]Maybe I should put the logbook over here.
[42:25.75]I...
[42:37.10]Put that over there.
[42:37.78]I don't think he has the gun.
[42:48.00]Okay, so let me save it.
[42:49.40]I'm gonna save it in slot... six.
[42:53.49]Slot two is the oh shit, we need to go back because I got soft locked somewhere bad.
[43:09.25]Um... What is this?
[43:15.68]What did I just turn into?
[43:18.38]Am I a diff- I'm a different guy!
[43:19.72]I'm like Rockman!
[43:25.53]Oh yeah!
[43:26.35]Do I do more damage or something?
[43:27.63]Is this advised?
[43:35.38]I got power- I'm saving it.
[43:57.53]He's got a gun.
[43:58.15]He has a gun.
[44:00.05]Okay.
[44:01.63]We'll do.
[44:02.79]Good.
[44:03.05]Frank, just, like, think about some really nice things.
[44:21.07]What beach is your favorite beach again, by the way?
[44:24.76]Oh, that'd be the Pacific Beach.
[44:27.97]Oh, I love that beach too.
[44:28.99]Think about that.
[44:29.51]What's your favorite drink on the beach?
[44:32.66]Oh, it's got to be a Long Island iced tea on the beach.
[44:36.17]Yeah, think about that.
[44:38.03]Is it sunny where you are right now?
[44:40.68]Oh, it's beautiful.
[44:41.30]It's so sunny.
[44:50.78]It didn't kill him instantly.
[44:57.61]Now he has a horrible memory.
[44:58.93]He can punch me in the stomach, dude!
[45:09.20]No!
[45:09.48]How could you punch me in the stomach?
[45:16.15]I have armor on.
[45:16.89]That's so thick.
[45:23.17]I guess we Mondites aren't one big happy family after all.
[45:28.68]Is it going to take the armor off?
[45:39.13]I love how he hasn't shot me with the gun yet.
[45:40.84]That's the best part.
[45:45.44]What a disaster this is.
[45:47.11]I can't believe he's still alive.
[45:49.10]I thought his tooth just came out.
[46:09.77]Finally!
[46:10.38]Exactly.
[46:18.25]Blaster.
[46:18.95]Gun.
[46:19.73]Okay, anything else on this guy?
[46:22.95]A blaster.
[46:24.08]Now I look cool and I've got the blaster weapon.
[46:28.18]Well, that didn't look that cool.
[46:29.26]Whatever.
[46:30.18]Just delete that part of the video.
[46:37.07]Uh... What?
[46:41.36]Why am I so...
[46:47.36]I'm really injured.
[46:51.38]Oh, come on, man.
[47:06.31]Save it, I guess.
[47:08.63]That's seven.
[47:22.66]Did I just crash this by doing- having it too long of a sentence?
[47:27.46]Oh, no.
[47:39.36]Okay.
[47:39.72]Uh, now I can go back in here?
[47:45.43]I'm glad I have the gun back.
[47:48.25]Alright, is this the 12 monitor room?
[47:55.09]I don't think this is the 12 monitor room.
[48:02.79]Wait, what is that?
[48:03.41]I want to see what that is.
[48:09.70]What is this?
[48:11.12]Like a pod.
[48:12.18]Can I get in the pod?
[48:15.85]Guys, can't get in the pod.
[48:18.63]Sorry.
[48:32.59]Is it on a different floor?
[48:39.92]This is 1, 2, 3... What floor would it be on?
[48:53.96]12 monitor room.
[48:55.38]Where was there a 12 monitor room?
[49:02.58]The beginning of the game?
[49:11.57]You were in the 12 monitor room.
[49:13.47]That looked like a 12... It looked like a console room.
[49:17.64]Was that actually the place I needed to be?
[49:29.52]Danger.
[49:30.06]React to approaching critical.
[49:32.56]I like how I'm running to the music though, that's great.
[49:41.02]Apparently I can get on one of these computers, I guess?
[49:43.07]I don't know.
[49:43.41]12 monitor room.
[49:48.06]Third PC?
[49:51.38]I don't think it's that.
[50:05.75]Is this Torgo music?
[50:20.30]Oh, we got to the runtime of one of the episodes.
[50:22.63]I mean, I've been looking around for the whole episode, but it's alright.
[50:34.14]At the bottom of these little stairs... These?
[50:49.95]...
[50:52.18]Oh shit, I'm going down again.
[50:54.68]Well, I'll just kill this guy.
[50:57.16]He doesn't even- Okay, I'm gonna light this guy up.
[51:01.37]Doesn't even have a gun.
[51:02.69]What a fool.
[51:04.41]Hey, fool!
[51:26.84]That guy had so much health.
[51:28.54]I'm so glad I had the gun.
[51:35.13]Okay, so what can I do in here?
[51:43.32]Uh, do I say anything back to him?
[51:55.87]Why didn't I do the thing where you go like, all clear here.
[52:01.53]Good to go.
[52:09.16]What?
[52:16.67]Who, where are you talking from?
[52:22.67]Did I butt dial this lady?
[52:29.46]Oh, well, sorry.
[52:32.25]What's this?
[52:33.21]Magic cube.
[52:34.27]Okay, alien artifact.
[52:36.27]I'll keep it.
[52:42.07]Oh, my God!
[52:42.64]Oh, my God!
[52:48.76]Oh, wait.
[52:52.38]Okay, hold on.
[52:52.84]Right here.
[52:54.91]This is definitely it.
[52:55.61]Yep.
[52:56.09]This is it.
[52:58.63]This is it, right?
[53:03.38]Bingo!
[53:10.16]What do I do with this guy?
[53:14.85]Do I power him on?
[53:34.16]Where do I take him?
[53:37.67]Do I leave the... I just... I'm gonna leave the room?
[53:41.31]Oh shit, I broke the wall.
[54:00.48]This thing is so cute!
[54:02.83]Are you cooked, baked, or raw tonight?
[54:05.42]I'm raw tonight.
[54:07.34]Raw.
[54:21.14]Yeah, this way.
[54:25.88]Because I couldn't... Remember, I couldn't go in this last time.
[54:29.06]It's not like I have a group of moderators that are feeding me every bit of fucking information that you could possibly need to complete this entire experience.
[54:36.87]Do you think that's happening right now?
[54:39.27]I mean, no, absolutely not.
[54:51.74]See, I'm not even human, so I won't get hurt by this.
[54:57.85]I would have figured that out.
[55:08.80]Music change.
[55:13.88]Okay, to be, let me, I'm going to give myself a little credit.
[55:17.11]I have not used the mod guides or girlfriend guide the whole time.
[55:25.22]Only, oh my god, what did I just do to that person?
[55:29.28]Was that bad?
[55:31.58]Was that bad?
[55:33.73]Can I get a confirmation from, uh...
[55:38.33]Did I get a confirmation?
[55:40.11]Was that bad?
[55:41.90]Should I reset or do I softlock the game?
[55:44.40]Is that not good?
[55:49.11]Because I didn't even press either of these buttons and I feel like I probably should have had to.
[55:58.08]Is it, should I save?
[56:07.13]I think I'm okay.
[56:08.39]I think it's alright.
[56:09.26]We're gonna go to save slot 8.
[56:19.31]Let's go!
[56:19.71]So now I can go over there, because the scary monster's not there anymore.
[56:26.16]And we can continue this let's play.
[56:34.54]Can I actually- wait, can I go in here?
[56:35.95]Or am I gonna die from the gas?
[56:43.53]Will this thing protect me?
[56:50.42]We're good.
[56:59.59]Okay, so what can I do in here?
[57:07.84]Dude, who's that?
[57:09.38]I'm gonna press this button.
[57:14.77]Laser bridge.
[57:17.99]Is that the doctor?
[57:19.48]Let's go kick his ass.
[57:23.52]I want answers on my origins!
[57:28.95]What?
[57:29.25]Who are you?
[57:29.73]Friend or foe?
[57:33.42]Foe!
[58:13.95]He might be immune to damage.
[58:15.25]He might be immune.
[58:16.27]He's immune.
[58:16.79]He's immune.
[58:17.23]He's immune.
[58:18.14]He's immune.
[58:21.00]Oh, shit.
[58:21.44]Do I have to Final Destination fight this guy like Smash Bros.
[58:24.00]style?
[58:27.39]He can't get that close.
[58:28.19]I don't want to take damage.
[58:32.23]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[58:39.23]No, look at how these guys made out of fucking corned beef right now.
[58:43.09]I was killing him.
[58:44.21]It's fine.
[58:55.67]What?
[58:56.85]What does that mean?
[58:58.33]What do I do?
[58:59.11]What do I do?
[58:59.69]There's 10 seconds left.
[59:07.36]Is the reactor gonna explode?
[59:14.09]I didn't even think I was even doing damage to him, man!
[59:16.58]I... I... Whatever.
[59:17.58]Uh... I'm gonna take a break.
[59:21.91]I'll be right back.
[59:24.57]I didn't... I think I was even hurting him.
[59:26.28]I didn't think... I thought he was invincible or something.
[59:31.83]Uh... I'll be back.
[59:32.79]Few minutes.
[59:34.07]See you guys really soon.
[59:44.08]Again, I thought that was me on camera again.
[59:49.06]Be right back.
[65:00.60]back.
[65:01.97]I'm ready.
[65:05.71]Good to go.
[65:13.61]Okay.
[65:15.11]So where was I?
[65:15.94]I was... I hope it's okay.
[65:17.38]Right, right here.
[65:36.09]Go back here.
[65:36.89]New episode?
[65:44.48]Nah, that BRB was part of the episode.
[65:47.47]They got really lazy.
[65:57.44]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[65:58.28]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[66:00.61]What do you mean wait?
[66:01.61]Go back, go back, go back.
[66:02.53]Wait, what do you mean?
[66:03.35]What happened?
[66:04.68]go back go back go back go back oh wait I gotta go back you need the code need code it's great I love how everybody is collectively playing this I'm just I'm just the guy driving the I don't know where we're going right like 10 000 people are in a car with me and I'm just the driver I've got a hat on I'm like alright
[66:34.56]Where are we going?
[66:36.47]And 10,000 people are just kind of screaming directions.
[66:41.23]And I look back sometimes and I'm like, Oh, you take a left up at this light up here?
[66:46.52]Yes!
[66:47.60]Yeah!
[66:48.88]Okay, I'll take a left at this light.
[66:51.61]Wow, this sure is a swell time.
[66:59.30]Okay.
[67:03.44]Datalog.
[67:07.99]Not this one?
[67:16.81]Rea- okay, reactor.
[67:19.05]A class 3 reactor alert is in effect.
[67:21.23]All non-essential personnel are to be evacuated immediately.
[67:29.83]Wha- I got it!
[67:30.37]135, right?
[67:31.21]Didn't we already- we already got this.
[67:32.80]One, three, five.
[67:33.72]I already did it.
[67:34.40]I do- Hey.
[67:35.78]I don't- I was almost just burping.
[67:37.52]I would have thrown up if I burped with my head turned like that.
[67:40.81]Uh, I don't need any more help.
[67:44.07]When I need help, I'll ask for it.
[67:49.31]And then the bus driver just goes on random streets, takes a left, drives for five minutes, takes a right, stops at a stop sign, turns around and just goes, I- I- I need- I need someone to tell me where we're going.
[68:04.07]That's what's happening right now.
[68:11.20]Let's do it.
[68:12.66]Save.
[68:28.78]Bingo.
[68:33.67]This is it.
[68:40.36]This is it.
[68:42.86]Start episode 16.
[68:47.29]Still on season one.
[68:52.67]Into the gas vault.
[68:55.30]Whatever this fucking thing is.
[69:03.40]Come and get me.
[69:05.90]Alright, 135.
[69:12.63]That computer's right there.
[69:19.04]Turn it off.
[69:20.54]Dude, what are you doing?
[69:26.49]I got it?
[69:27.07]The alien lets forth a bone-chilling wail.
[69:34.42]Wait, there's one... Get away from me!
[69:40.66]What, I did 134?
[69:42.17]Oh my god.
[69:44.57]He's... He's... Mom, he's guarding... He's guarding the... He's guarding the fridge!
[69:48.83]I want a Snickers ice cream bar!
[69:58.89]Power it down!
[70:12.62]Why won't it turn off?
[70:17.43]Why is the game slowing down?
[70:29.46]The game... Do I go in that?
[70:30.60]They need to all be lit up?
[70:35.78]I thought they had to be depressed!
[70:38.73]I thought they had to be depressed, okay?
[70:40.41]It's a button.
[70:42.64]Oh, dear.
[70:44.00]I look like a crumpled piece of fucking tinfoil.
[70:47.89]I'm just jumping in.
[70:48.89]I'm jumping in.
[70:49.53]I'm gonna save myself the fucking misery.
[71:04.85]Alright, well, let's try it again.
[71:08.67]I thought they had to be pushed down.
[71:18.65]I'll put it up.
[71:19.75]I'm ready.
[71:27.14]I can kill the alien.
[71:28.32]Okay, hold on.
[71:28.84]I've got some intel on how to kill the alien.
[71:34.87]I've got intel.
[71:37.81]Episode 16B.
[71:43.10]Season 1.
[71:43.92]This is episode 16B.
[71:47.50]Yes.
[71:49.06]I'm a visionary director.
[71:50.45]We left in all the bullshit.
[71:52.11]We left in all the stuff that didn't work.
[71:56.18]My vision was there's seven or eight different versions of each episode with all the fucking mistakes left in.
[72:01.37]Okay.
[72:02.47]Find me a, find me a cartoon that did that.
[72:04.83]Okay.
[72:05.07]Find me a cartoon that did that.
[72:21.38]Check this out.
[72:24.60]Check out the Intel here.
[72:39.58]Get the over here.
[72:40.74]What is he doing?
[72:46.15]You get follow me over here.
[72:47.91]Follow me right now.
[72:59.43]Why won't he follow me?
[73:09.89]He won't follow me!
[73:10.91]It doesn't work!
[73:11.77]He just tried to duck the gun.
[73:20.68]Follow me won't do it!
[73:31.54]Oh my goodness.
[73:37.53]Did it work?
[73:49.87]1, 3, 5.
[73:57.06]God damn it, man.
[74:01.08]I don't know why he won't follow me okay I pressed down one three five
[74:18.42]And it didn't work.
[74:19.23]I left 135 lit up.
[74:21.23]I don't know if it worked, because the alien punched me in the back of the head.
[74:24.72]Before I could press the button, I think.
[74:26.56]I have to kill the alien.
[74:28.24]And I have intel on how to kill the alien.
[74:30.19]But he didn't do what the intel has suggested.
[74:40.70]Hi there.
[74:41.38]Jerma985 here.
[74:42.98]Fake pretend director.
[74:45.83]I didn't make this.
[74:46.51]I have nothing to do with this.
[74:48.27]This is episode 16C.
[74:50.69]Season 1.
[74:55.38]I did not make this.
[74:57.82]I'm merely a participant and a consumer.
[75:01.39]But it's fun to pretend.
[75:07.58]Okay, here we go.
[75:13.22]I'm gonna try to aggro from all the way over here.
[75:54.83]Am I insane or did he chase me across this last time?
[76:01.14]What's his problem now?
[76:12.40]Anybody need me?
[76:12.74]Help me, please.
[76:14.96]Somebody.
[76:15.16]Well, he said that they're really cool.
[76:18.06]Oh, here we go.
[76:18.69]Here we go.
[76:19.15]I got it.
[76:19.35]I got it.
[76:19.65]I got it.
[76:23.64]Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back over here.
[76:25.64]Look, I'm over here.
[76:27.56]Oh my... Okay, so it kind of worked.
[76:47.38]It's gonna work, you'll see.
[76:56.81]It's going to work.
[76:57.61]Just have faith.
[77:05.38]time until reactor critical indeterminate why would I do that this is it this is the one everybody get your predictions in this is the one I can't believe I'm actually really happy that like 85 percent everybody are believers this time that just shows that your confidence that you have in me I appreciate it guys like I do and I probably don't say it enough but like it means like a lot like thank you you guys are like super supportive and stuff
[77:36.10]What's support?
[77:38.48]Thank you.
[77:38.86]You little fucking assholes.
[77:48.91]He's not- Ooh!
[77:50.56]Dude!
[77:53.54]What is this bullshit?
[77:54.64]He did it!
[77:55.24]He fucking did it, guys!
[77:57.95]He actually did it, but then he didn't care to do it again!
[78:00.85]Follow me, please!
[78:11.15]Oh my God.
[78:12.63]Wait, can I turn it off?
[78:15.27]Come on, it's 1.35.
[78:16.41]I can do it in three seconds.
[78:17.70]He still is hitting me.
[78:30.93]Okay.
[78:33.90]Alright.
[78:36.93]You have to build aggro on him.
[78:39.36]Alright, so I need to shoot him like 10 times.
[78:44.54]Because I shot him 50 times and it did not kill him.
[78:48.27]So I don't know, man.
[78:58.75]And action.
[79:05.55]I want a little bit more emotion from you this time, Jeremy.
[79:09.40]That last one, it sounded like you were kind of enthusiastic about him being on the bridge, but we'll get it in episode 16D.
[79:37.12]This guy doesn't care at all.
[79:45.28]Oh, he's running.
[79:46.24]He's running.
[79:46.66]He's running.
[79:47.10]Alright.
[79:47.49]I got him.
[79:47.75]I got him.
[79:47.99]He's running.
[79:48.27]He's running.
[79:48.55]He's running.
[79:49.07]He's running.
[79:49.61]He's running.
[79:50.77]He's running.
[79:53.10]Drop his ass.
[79:54.74]Drop him.
[79:57.39]Oh, let's go.
[80:05.91]Okay, 1-3-5.
[80:06.96]1- What is going on?
[80:19.65]Help me!
[80:20.98]What's happening?
[80:21.90]Help!
[80:22.94]1-3-5.
[80:23.28]1-3-5 is lit up right now.
[80:29.37]What do I do?
[80:30.01]What do I do?
[80:30.39]What do I do?
[80:30.85]What do I do?
[80:35.60]Lose this fucking number, lady.
[80:38.42]I don't know what's going on!
[80:39.26]What happened?
[80:41.01]What am I doing?
[80:41.97]What do I do?
[80:43.37]What do I do?
[80:46.08]What's this?
[80:55.25]Okay, do I have to turn those both to green and then do it?
[81:06.88]So I have to go to each one of those and do the Acme Wile E. Coyote plunger shit and then do it.
[81:14.85]Oh my God.
[81:15.79]Okay.
[81:16.31]Well, at least I've... I got it.
[81:18.05]This is the one.
[81:18.80]Episode 16E.
[81:19.58]In this episode, I wanted to give the actor a little time before the camera started.
[81:32.29]See if we caught anything before I said action.
[81:36.15]And...
[81:38.03]Weirdly enough, no.
[81:39.68]We didn't get anything.
[81:41.38]The actors usually are pretty quiet on set.
[81:44.26]You hear a lot of crazy stories about how actors are crazy and they do all this stuff, but no.
[81:49.55]Tim was actually pretty quiet in the suit.
[81:53.32]He didn't really need much.
[81:56.34]He wanted one blueberry muffin every morning, which is...
[82:01.25]That's understandable.
[82:02.38]I mean, that's not like a huge crazy request.
[82:05.12]Oh, remember when somebody who needed wanted only green M&Ms, but you don't know about that story.
[82:09.89]It's because she wanted to make sure that they actually read the contract for safety and stuff.
[82:15.69]Make sure they did everything else in the contract, which you don't really hear about it too much.
[82:21.98]Anyways, we'll let the episode play out.
[82:24.01]He didn't really say much.
[82:24.69]This is episode 16E.
[82:29.96]Oh my goodness, here we go!
[82:35.30]That's me!
[82:36.84]Hey, stupid alien out there!
[82:41.28]Whoa-ho-ho!
[82:44.93]I decided to have two episodes in one here because.
[82:49.11]That actor got fired after this.
[82:51.21]Tim got fired after that episode is episode 16 G. What we didn't know is that he was taking items from the set.
[83:00.84]And he was bringing him home.
[83:02.16]He's stealing a lot of stuff, so he was actually like a nice guy, but pretty quiet.
[83:05.89]Like I said, blueberry muffin.
[83:08.33]I don't know that actress is going to start talking, sorry.
[83:36.45]Come on, do it.
[83:38.43]Is he following me?
[83:50.08]Well, I'm gonna hit the plungers, whatever.
[83:52.07]I'm gonna hit the plungers.
[83:54.79]Taking a really long ass time doing that.
[84:10.48]Is he going across the bridge?
[84:15.38]Dude, what?
[84:31.02]Hey, can I ask a question from the guide Andes that are helping me here?
[84:35.78]Does 135 need to be lit or does 135 need to be depressed?
[84:41.15]Because I'm getting a 50-50 response from everybody.
[84:45.23]Is it depressed or lit?
[84:46.95]Because I feel like each one of them did nothing.
[85:00.00]Warning.
[85:06.91]This is episode 16.
[85:07.99]16R, I think.
[85:12.92]The director, Jerma985, was fired from the project.
[85:17.45]He was doing this thing where he numbered out the episodes.
[85:20.31]I think I may have missed a few of these.
[85:23.30]But he was fired.
[85:24.92]He was stealing from the set.
[85:26.61]He would take things home a lot of times.
[85:29.17]We would pocket food, and he would take different electrical equipment that wasn't his.
[85:34.32]In fact, we had a problem with a few people doing this.
[85:36.34]I'm the new director, by the way.
[85:37.48]My name is Dylan, with an interesting last name.
[85:43.09]I'll tell you, I just fucking tell you.
[85:45.26]But yeah, we'll let episode 16R play out.
[85:49.06]I think this is the one that we actually kept.
[85:52.36]I guess.
[85:53.02]I mean, I got brought onto this project when I'm halfway through, so I just did what I could.
[85:57.05]The suit is really cool, though.
[85:58.13]I added some adjustments to it.
[86:25.97]Forget about the alien, honestly.
[86:27.83]Look, I'll take a point of damage.
[86:30.66]Who cares?
[86:34.54]I'm so glad that I buttoned that lady.
[86:37.19]There he goes.
[86:37.63]Alright, there he goes.
[86:41.19]Should I try to kill him?
[86:42.23]Hold on, I'm going to get him.
[86:42.97]I'm going to kill him.
[86:44.15]No, it's bait.
[86:47.22]Dude, what if he presses the button?
[86:48.66]What if he does it to me, reverse Looney Tunes style?
[86:52.08]I'm not falling for it.
[86:56.60]Let's go.
[87:02.01]Bingo.
[87:02.39]Alright, where is he?
[87:13.33]He's going to Looney Tunes me, isn't he?
[87:15.99]I think he's going to Looney Tunes me.
[87:18.23]Please don't.
[87:30.47]can't believe it I can't believe it but you know it does make sense he learned a lot so the alien has to die
[87:53.59]The alien needs to die.
[87:55.99]We have to get him to aggro across the bridge, drop him, then go across.
[87:59.76]It has to be in that order.
[88:01.76]Because he is not bailing.
[88:03.74]People are like, oh wow, look, he's bailing.
[88:05.43]He's smart.
[88:06.01]No.
[88:06.69]He's setting up position to drop me.
[88:09.01]He's going to his queue.
[88:11.74]Because I didn't kill him.
[88:25.03]time until reactor critical indeterminate oh is it recording oh okay this is a 16 uh
[88:49.48]I think you, I think is what it is.
[88:52.88]We skipped a few.
[88:54.48]This project has lost the studio $700 million.
[88:59.27]We keep having to re-record the same episode.
[89:01.29]What we didn't know about that is we got to this point where the actors just wouldn't work together well.
[89:07.80]We ended up shooting this four or five hundred different times.
[89:11.55]The studio stepped in and cut the project down after this.
[89:16.10]It's unfortunate that this is how it has to be.
[89:21.84]I didn't tell you my name.
[89:23.77]Why didn't I tell you my name?
[89:24.95]I told you my name was Dean Arthur.
[89:32.94]And I'll be working on some other projects in the future.
[89:37.78]If you need a director, I'll be available.
[89:42.83]I have quite a few episodes of this particular piece of shit under my belt.
[89:47.63]Yeah, you'll probably never see him, though.
[89:50.89]But yeah, it hit me up.
[89:52.29]I do commercials.
[89:53.43]I do television.
[89:54.25]I do music videos.
[89:56.29]I do all kinds of shit.
[89:58.51]There's episode 16, You, and this is the one where we got kicked off the set and we lost all the money and the studio got rid of all of us.
[90:05.74]So we just couldn't get past this one fucking episode.
[90:10.52]People are calling it the curse of episode 16.
[90:13.51]I'm telling you, it's fucking real.
[90:15.41]It's real.
[90:15.75]The curse of episode 16 is real, man.
[90:18.29]Don't let anybody tell you it wasn't.
[90:42.62]I'll beat him across the bridge.
[90:50.86]I'll beat him across the bridge.
[90:52.54]We both are going to be running for it and I'll beat him across the bridge.
[91:05.52]No.
[91:15.01]Okay, come on, come on, come on.
[91:15.93]No, no, no.
[91:16.21]Let me do it.
[91:16.57]He's stuck, he's stuck, he's stuck, he's stuck, he's stuck.
[91:18.07]Perfect.
[91:19.97]Don't let him get to before me.
[91:25.08]No, you piece of shit.
[91:26.80]That's scripted.
[91:31.16]There's no way he got across that bridge as fast as that.
[91:33.26]No way.
[91:43.95]Okay.
[91:53.25]Time until reactor critical.
[91:55.23]Indeterminate.
[91:56.91]This is, uh, insurance salesman, uh, ID code 565, uh, 5.
[92:01.50]I've, uh, just printed out the files here, found a few of these.
[92:06.44]And, uh, we're just kind of clearing stuff out.
[92:08.99]Um, and I feel it may have been fun to do my own podcast over these.
[92:15.12]I mean, maybe some people will get this far, but, you know, I'm just clearing it up and, uh, you know, who cares if this fucking joke is over?
[92:19.66]Goodbye.
[92:20.00]Goodbye.
[92:55.68]Follow your nose!
[93:09.09]This is the one.
[93:27.17]Hey, it's me Dean.
[93:50.68]I might sound a little chipper.
[93:52.45]We finally got to episode 17.
[93:54.77]We actually got some Kickstarter money.
[93:57.30]I kickstarted the project.
[93:59.28]It was me and a few others that were on the set.
[94:01.92]And we got more money than ever.
[94:03.78]Apparently people thought we went viral.
[94:06.68]We went viral with that last episode 16 thing.
[94:10.69]So that's pretty cool.
[94:11.53]That's pretty cool.
[94:11.95]But now we got a few bones to work with.
[94:15.59]So episode 17 will be out.
[94:17.81]I look forward to that.
[94:19.30]I look forward to this project.
[94:22.08]And yeah, let's go.
[94:24.12]Bioforge the series.
[94:26.81]I'm so happy to hear that.
[94:29.75]We'll see you in episode 18.
[94:42.73]Should I not save on the bridge?
[94:43.69]Is that a bad idea?
[94:51.72]Is that a fake?
[94:54.90]Does that sound like a fake Dean?
[94:57.80]Did somebody see the success of what happened with that and then just kind of just took it over and did a Kickstarter?
[95:06.59]And is putting on the voice to try to make people think that it's the original cast.
[95:16.09]And crew.
[95:20.10]Alright, so what does it even do for us?
[95:22.54]I don't even know what I even did there.
[95:25.85]Why does the DVD commentary only happen during the credits?
[95:28.99]I don't know.
[95:29.93]Because they're introducing it.
[95:31.75]Some people do that.
[95:32.64]I've seen plenty of DVDs where they just did an opening credits thing.
[95:43.65]Name one.
[95:50.27]I don't know.
[95:51.51]I can't even tell you the last DVD commentary I even listened to.
[96:00.59]Name 100 DVDs.
[96:06.96]Click.
[96:08.76]Big Mama's House.
[96:09.66]Big Mama's House 2.
[96:11.72]Shrek.
[96:18.67]Shrek.
[96:26.81]I can't do it.
[96:31.19]I can't do it.
[96:31.99]I can't.
[96:37.00]That's four, right?
[96:45.68]OK, so now what can I do up here now?
[96:48.44]Can I press another button?
[96:49.22]Wait, can I fly out of here?
[97:01.21]I have to go to the fourth floor now?
[97:03.66]Four.
[97:05.84]I named just as many DVDs as the floor I need to go to.
[97:08.01]I'm seeing that I should take off the suit.
[97:13.03]I'm sorry.
[97:13.66]I'm keeping the suit on.
[97:14.48]And I know if you're not good enough with the suit on, then off.
[97:17.50]It should be off.
[97:18.08]If it's off, then you don't deserve it anyways.
[97:21.45]But you know what?
[97:23.63]Earthworm Jim didn't give a fuck about that.
[97:25.16]So why do I?
[97:41.12]Okay, we need to go to four.
[97:45.45]Please secure all sidearms.
[97:48.56]Energy discharges in this chamber are extremely hazardous.
[97:52.64]Hey, are you legit Team Edward?
[97:55.71]I'm legit hit the eject button on the DVD player, okay?
[98:03.14]What's going on?
[98:07.57]Boss fight.
[98:12.61]Boss fight, I told you.
[98:19.44]It's like a standoff?
[98:26.31]Holy shit!
[98:33.38]Okay, so we sneak by that, I guess.
[98:57.91]Gotta save it in the elevator.
[99:11.62]I skipped the commentary on these.
[99:27.00]I listened to it.
[99:33.46]So, the funny... I just wish that wouldn't happen so often.
[99:44.43]Please secure all sidearms.
[99:47.72]Energy discharges in this chamber are extremely hazardous.
[99:51.74]I probably shouldn't save it here.
[99:52.98]It's gonna bug it out.
[99:56.07]Save it right here.
[99:57.13]I'm gonna land.
[100:01.27]Yeah, see?
[100:01.77]See what I mean?
[100:04.22]Uh, we're gonna keep it on original cast.
[100:07.23]I think that's a fine place for it.
[100:12.58]Skip.
[100:13.66]Alright.
[100:15.88]My strategy is to run back in the elevator and ricochet bolt.
[100:38.21]God.
[100:58.53]No!
[101:27.22]He shot fucking five times in a row.
[101:31.34]Since when did he increase his difficulty in shooting?
[101:45.28]This music in this game sucks so bad.
[101:47.15]No, it doesn't.
[101:48.97]This is awesome fighting music.
[101:52.03]Let me listen.
[101:59.36]I wasn't paying attention.
[102:00.16]Let me see.
[102:08.25]There's no music.
[102:10.73]I'm gonna run behind him.
[102:11.82]It'll take him longer to turn around.
[102:25.87]Uh-huh.
[102:36.67]Does he do a three-shot spray?
[103:06.52]How low is your health?
[103:11.29]Um... It is 100%.
[103:14.95]100.
[103:15.68]Not even 95 or 96.
[103:18.46]100.
[103:18.82]100.
[103:36.68]Good shot.
[103:50.02]I'm dead.
[103:50.38]He shot me right in the fucking dick.
[103:58.07]Good god.
[103:58.79]No.
[104:05.35]Is this possible?
[104:06.67]Is this actually even possible?
[104:22.87]Can you ignore him?
[104:24.13]I don't think I can go by.
[104:25.32]Last time I ran by him, he insta-teleported behind me.
[104:29.08]Well, he teleported and shot me.
[104:31.32]I'll get it right now.
[104:32.38]No more excuses.
[104:32.99]This is it.
[105:10.47]Yeah, excuse for security robot.
[105:19.26]Good music.
[105:23.73]Did I even take damage?
[105:34.87]He's doing the rock.
[105:35.53]He's rocking out.
[105:37.35]Did I check the rubble?
[105:45.64]Okay, I just put my gun in the fire.
[105:47.64]That would have been bad.
[105:50.25]Save the game?
[105:51.15]I will.
[105:51.39]I gotta get in a good spot.
[106:09.74]Um...
[106:12.61]So I just, I want to read you.
[106:15.01]Holly just posted this.
[106:15.83]She said, I just, just, I want you to see this.
[106:18.87]In the guide, in the written part of this walkthrough, this is what is written.
[106:25.92]Sadly, I cannot give you a solution for this as the beginning patterns appear random.
[106:30.79]So all I did was push buttons randomly like an idiot, hoping I'd get lucky.
[106:35.87]After two minutes of jerking off on it, I got it to unlock.
[106:40.10]Stupid puzzle if you ask me.
[106:43.64]That is in the walkthrough.
[106:47.75]So I will, I will see.
[107:26.13]I'm following the guide.
[107:27.15]I'm following the guide, okay?
[107:29.62]I'm following the guide.
[107:30.74]Close.
[108:27.57]Yeah!
[108:34.74]That was even less than two minutes.
[108:55.73]Yep.
[109:03.45]Oh.
[109:16.70]The creator.
[109:20.01]Wait.
[109:22.55]I want to explore.
[109:23.53]This is a point-and-click, beat-em-up shooting adventure action game.
[109:28.42]Make sure I don't...
[109:30.94]We're gonna go this way first.
[109:52.52]Upgrading the suit?
[109:54.22]Oh, hold on.
[109:55.82]Don't move.
[109:56.64]I can kill this from... right?
[110:03.96]Oh, who cares?
[110:04.78]Just run.
[110:05.76]You don't even get experience points for anything.
[110:07.69]Just run.
[110:12.39]Oh, shit.
[110:15.61]Oh.
[110:19.50]Oh.
[110:30.23]There's more of these?
[110:31.37]Okay, I'm not...
[110:38.25]What is that?
[110:38.63]A Snorlax or whatever they're called?
[110:40.29]Okay.
[110:45.80]Did I save it?
[110:52.35]Did I take any hits?
[110:55.32]I still have 100% HP.
[110:56.58]I'm saving it right here.
[111:00.51]At, uh, 8.
[111:25.84]I want to see what it is.
[111:27.20]I want to see.
[111:29.42]It's going to be a huge monster and it's going to be crazy.
[111:32.55]Oh, for the love of goodness.
[111:34.01]What is this?
[111:37.44]Do I have to jump this stuff?
[111:48.59]I don't think there's a jump button.
[111:50.88]Wait.
[111:51.44]Yes, there is.
[112:05.53]That doesn't work.
[112:11.34]I don't think I can do this.
[112:25.36]No.
[112:29.21]This is just death.
[112:45.47]Check in here.
[112:46.47]No, I took a hit.
[112:47.52]No, I didn't.
[112:48.64]Check this out.
[112:49.90]We're loading that because that's exactly where I am.
[112:53.30]Get out of the suit maybe to jump?
[112:56.51]Hmm, let's see what's in here first.
[113:05.10]This doesn't open?
[113:09.13]Hmm.
[113:14.29]Okay.
[113:14.41]This is a flute moment?
[113:45.34]Got that person for a fucking hour.
[113:46.67]Oh, come on, man.
[113:58.24]Alright, I'm gonna go back.
[114:11.26]No!
[114:13.50]Nooooo!
[114:17.42]Oh, wait a minute.
[114:19.19]What about over here?
[114:21.23]This looks safe.
[114:24.74]Uh.
[114:28.42]That.
[114:35.04]OK.
[114:39.90]So no, apparently.
[114:50.55]Play the flute there.
[114:57.36]You went into the Snorlax pit?
[114:59.14]It's alright.
[115:06.63]Nope.
[115:07.21]I'm not taking damage.
[115:08.24]No way.
[115:25.60]See that play?
[115:27.88]You can see that in any of your cartoons.
[115:56.31]Shit.
[115:59.48]Too many damage, too many hits.
[116:01.66]Way too many hits.
[116:02.76]If this is correct, I gotta redo it.
[116:05.79]Way too much damage done.
[116:07.53]Too much.
[116:08.17]This is an unbelievable amount of damage I've taken.
[116:20.03]That goes back to the helipad or whatever it is.
[116:25.07]Maybe I can do something here.
[116:26.73]This got... I went all the way back here.
[116:28.61]There's gotta be something I can do, right?
[116:40.40]It hit me.
[116:41.96]Let me just explore.
[116:46.21]Because he's talking to me in here.
[116:48.25]He has dialog in this tunnel.
[116:50.51]So I definitely have to be in this tunnel.
[116:56.91]There's got to be somewhere I can drop down, right?
[117:00.68]Am I scared of this for no reason?
[117:05.78]Maybe I can actually, maybe I can just drop down here.
[117:12.37]Yes, you can.
[117:13.29]Yes, you can.
[117:15.46]Okay.
[117:16.62]That is a, that, that distance is way, way smaller.
[117:39.16]Whatever this thing is, it's loud.
[117:45.37]Okay.
[117:47.17]Let's make a new save point.
[117:49.44]I'm gonna refill my iced tea.
[117:51.48]I'm coming back.
[117:53.16]Take a break.
[117:54.08]I'm gonna put this in slot 7.
[118:05.52]I will.
[118:08.27]Be right back.
[118:09.58]See you in a few minutes.
[123:42.53]You know what annoys me?
[123:45.42]When he takes so long.
[123:48.22]He says, I'll be back in a few minutes.
[123:49.60]It's like five minutes.
[123:51.14]That just really, that gets me, you know what I mean?
[123:54.18]It's a certain way I feel about it.
[124:02.83]And the fact that he doesn't care, he doesn't care is what really gets me.
[124:11.48]Okay.
[124:14.02]Did I save it?
[124:19.59]Let's try this.
[124:21.73]I can actually land on here.
[124:23.79]I'm not afraid of that anymore.
[124:25.95]And nobody can even see anything.
[124:27.23]You know what really just pisses me off about him?
[124:30.14]He just doesn't... He doesn't get it.
[124:34.94]How could he not know that?
[124:37.28]How long has he been streaming for?
[124:38.54]Do you think he would know that?
[124:41.79]God.
[124:44.89]Um.
[124:47.15]I don't think I can jump this.
[124:53.11]Why the hell does it wait?
[124:54.35]Wait, is that corner work?
[124:56.29]No way.
[124:59.82]Backflip over it, hold on.
[125:03.41]Why would it want me to be here?
[125:23.87]No, I don't.
[125:24.87]The jump doesn't go over a ledge.
[125:29.47]Play the flute.
[125:31.70]Don't leave that blaster.
[125:34.98]You can definitely make this jump.
[125:36.28]I definitely cannot make this jump.
[125:37.76]I go straight down.
[125:38.54]I sink like a rock.
[125:42.17]No way.
[125:52.16]Hmm.
[126:02.95]That didn't do anything.
[126:06.23]It doesn't matter anyway, you're the mascot for the Boston Save Scummers.
[126:17.81]Oh, stepping up to the plate now.
[126:20.79]Number eight, the Boston Save Scummers.
[126:23.86]You guys understand that like 50 to 100 years from now?
[126:27.98]Will team names be stuff like that to be able to relate to you guys?
[126:37.49]Build a bridge?
[126:38.27]I think I'm stuck here.
[126:46.23]Oh, stepping up to the plate for the California Riz.
[126:55.02]You laugh.
[126:56.72]Wait 50 to 100 years.
[127:03.80]Yeah, I'm... I can't go anywhere.
[127:05.82]I'm screwed.
[127:07.41]I have to... I'm just gonna fall.
[127:08.91]Watch this.
[127:11.25]Unless... Unless that weird thing sticking out on the left.
[127:20.14]The chicken jockeys.
[127:21.62]No, that's not... That's a... That's... I mean, maybe... It would be like the... The Freddy's or something.
[127:29.97]What's the pizza place's name?
[127:34.30]What's it called?
[127:36.02]The Fazbear's, yes.
[127:50.61]And Freddy would be the mascot, jumping around, dancing around and stuff.
[127:55.96]Oh, I weep.
[127:58.02]Oh, I weep for the future.
[128:11.59]I can't open this, but I'm going to try it again.
[128:23.12]That's a fake as fuck FNAF fan.
[128:25.96]When have you heard me say that I was a fan of FNAF?
[128:29.89]I think they're fine.
[128:33.63]They're fine.
[128:38.86]I think the first one is okay.
[128:41.70]We're cooking.
[128:42.32]This is cooking a little.
[128:43.54]What is going on here?
[128:44.86]What weird art style and... Wait.
[128:50.27]Hold on.
[128:52.47]I'm gonna give you the flute.
[129:03.72]What did I just pick up?
[129:05.65]Did I just pick something up off the ground?
[129:10.58]Wait, what about... Use the alien cube!
[129:16.47]Holy shit!
[129:17.11]I have to use the alien... I used the alien cube!
[129:23.16]The alien cube, dude, and tele... Wow!
[129:26.60]I did not look over at the guide.
[129:28.56]I actually figured that out.
[129:29.62]I clicked on the alien cube and it worked.
[129:33.99]How am I supposed to... Wait, what?
[129:40.28]I said that with like a YouTuber accent too.
[129:42.13]I gotta hold on.
[129:44.81]Let me chill out for a second.
[129:46.57]What are we supposed to do about this?
[129:53.48]What?
[130:03.03]Why would this ever work?
[130:06.35]Dude, bro's pulling out the alien cube now.
[130:09.14]He knows what he's doing.
[130:15.11]Okay.
[130:19.08]What direction am I facing?
[130:22.26]I... Let's put the alien cube away.
[130:41.61]Save it.
[130:43.57]Uh, we're gonna put this on 6.
[131:01.41]Whatever.
[131:10.74]Oh, we know what to do with the other section now, alright?
[131:26.31]Hey, you were offended when I called you a FNAF fan.
[131:28.77]I'm sorry about that.
[131:31.86]No, I was angry when you called me a fake FNAF fan.
[131:34.94]Because this implies that I'm a real FNAF fan.
[131:38.97]And I don't know why you even got that information.
[131:42.81]What is this?
[131:47.34]What is he doing?
[131:49.44]Um... Am I...
[131:55.84]What?
[131:56.18]Unscrew... A bomb!
[132:02.55]A bomb!
[132:04.05]Oh!
[132:04.53]Though surprised.
[132:06.17]Um... I don't know what to do with it!
[132:11.98]Feed it to the monster!
[132:14.26]Throw it in the monster's mouth?
[132:17.81]I don't... How do I throw it?
[132:22.25]I don't know, dude.
[132:22.75]I'm getting behind something.
[132:24.20]I'm getting behind something.
[132:26.28]I'm getting by.
[132:26.78]I put it down and put right... Oh my fucking god.
[132:41.68]I was trying to... A bomb!
[132:55.51]I want to do that again.
[132:56.47]This game, I love this game.
[133:02.10]This game is so fun.
[133:06.86]It's got that exact amount of toasted edges that I like.
[133:12.29]Do you know what I mean?
[133:14.17]The edges are almost burnt.
[133:15.57]They're not quite though.
[133:17.53]The middle is still soft.
[133:18.62]The bread's still soft.
[133:29.97]I'm putting this down right in the... Come on.
[133:44.06]Right here.
[133:51.91]Don't fall, man.
[134:07.01]Oh, that is... Uh oh.
[134:15.68]Crouch behind this.
[134:16.58]How do you crouch?
[134:26.51]This thing has a million seconds.
[134:28.29]Wait, what?
[134:32.18]Where is it?
[134:32.58]Is it in my hand?
[134:45.91]Do I still have the bomb?
[134:53.12]Okay.
[134:57.52]So that monster eats you.
[134:59.12]Bomb, you have to make the... Okay.
[135:02.19]I know what you have to do.
[135:03.91]You get the bomb.
[135:05.61]You put the bomb down in front of where the monster spawns.
[135:08.44]The monster is going to look at it and go, he's going to eat it.
[135:12.74]And then he explodes because for some reason a monster will just eat anything even if it's a ticking bomb.
[135:37.64]The solution is probably the alien cube, man.
[135:39.64]I don't know if it's the alien cube.
[135:43.03]Let me look around first.
[135:44.51]Okay, wait, he's already up.
[135:49.40]Monster's already there.
[135:50.80]Okay.
[135:52.78]So, hold on.
[135:59.71]Can't do that.
[136:02.20]Is there anything else over here on the left?
[136:03.52]There's not.
[136:03.94]Alright, so, can I shoot him?
[136:05.78]What if I shoot him?
[136:12.04]He might be immune to the laser.
[136:24.58]Somebody's in here.
[136:25.62]Save it.
[136:37.12]Okay, monster outside.
[136:46.48]Can I open this?
[136:51.72]Nope.
[136:54.15]Oh wait, I can get in that maybe.
[136:55.53]Energy refill?
[137:07.38]What on Earth am I doing?
[137:08.48]You must be the escaped prisoner from the base.
[137:13.15]All I want is to survive.
[137:15.94]Friend?
[137:17.34]No, we ain't doing that.
[137:24.19]I'm just killing you with a gun.
[137:32.30]I don't care.
[137:32.74]This is survival time, man.
[137:39.22]You want me to throw my weapons down and fight?
[137:41.83]No.
[137:43.33]What, are you crazy?
[137:46.74]He's got a stronger gun.
[138:00.02]Wait, wait, wait, follow me.
[138:01.42]I'm going to make the monster eat him.
[138:07.77]Wait, I'm going to give him the bomb.
[138:11.67]I'm going to give him the bomb.
[138:16.84]What the hell are you doing?
[138:17.79]Don't take a bomb out of here.
[138:19.17]What are you crazy?
[138:27.80]That's an active warhead.
[138:29.36]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[138:41.08]I'm crazy.
[138:42.00]I'm crazy.
[138:42.66]I'm crazy.
[138:43.36]I'm crazy.
[138:45.50]I'm crazy.
[138:47.39]I'm crazy.
[138:49.45]I'm crazy.
[138:51.15]I shall attempt to make your death as slow and painful as possible.
[138:59.81]Yeah!
[139:00.23]Oops.
[139:07.38]Okay.
[139:08.79]Uh... I think we have to get the guy to get eaten.
[139:24.83]He definitely gets eaten by the guy.
[139:38.82]Come find me.
[139:50.13]Come find me.
[139:55.22]His guns overheating.
[140:15.24]Bet you you want to find me out here.
[140:19.80]This is one-on-one only.
[140:23.22]You and me.
[140:23.86]No guns.
[140:24.90]You know what?
[140:25.50]No guns.
[140:26.38]Put the guns down, man.
[140:28.87]What a dick.
[140:29.63]Come on, dude.
[140:33.39]Ooh!
[140:37.50]Should I just beat the shit out of him?
[140:46.65]He's not really following me.
[140:50.85]Oh
[141:30.72]I thought he was dead.
[141:37.31]Oh, good thing I ducked.
[141:38.99]Ooh, big ducks here.
[141:40.98]Huge avoiding.
[141:42.16]Huge dodge rolls.
[142:00.25]Does he follow me out here?
[142:01.13]I don't think he's gonna follow me out.
[142:16.51]No.
[142:35.20]Oh my fucking god.
[142:52.30]Oh my god.
[142:54.66]I didn't want to heal because I didn't- I feel like I've- I gotta figure out what to do with this guy.
[143:03.14]Can I like push him into this pod?
[143:06.42]You know what?
[143:06.94]Maybe I can just push him into the pod.
[143:08.80]I'm going to kick him in.
[143:09.40]The thing is going to close on him.
[143:10.98]He's going to go and it's going to vacuum seal him.
[143:14.25]That's what I'm going to try.
[143:34.23]Stand up fight.
[143:39.56]It's annoying that he says that and then he shoots the gun.
[144:00.91]You can't.
[144:02.21]You can't.
[144:14.54]Maybe I should just bring the bomb in here.
[144:23.87]No, I'm telling you my strategy of kick him into the the human vacuum sealer is what I'm doing.
[144:33.73]All I want is to survive.
[144:36.67]If we don't work together right now, we're both dead.
[144:39.37]Get a grind levels and come back.
[144:44.90]I gotta be moving immediately when the cutscene ends.
[144:49.27]Dude, what the fuck?
[144:58.36]Wait till the gun overheats.
[145:02.47]How did he pre-fire me?
[145:04.45]I- He... It's like... How did you even do that?
[145:11.82]He was leading the target.
[145:14.80]What is massive?
[145:15.73]Oh.
[145:18.53]Where are we?
[145:19.93]Eight?
[145:22.56]Nine?
[145:26.10]What number were we on?
[145:29.49]Oh, there we go.
[145:33.60]Get the healing spray.
[145:35.37]When he shoots me, I go through a two to five second full unskippable animation where I dive full motion video onto the ground and I have no control over my character.
[145:56.55]You must be the escaped prisoner from the base.
[145:59.65]Wait, maybe I'll try to backflip.
[146:01.36]That actually might work.
[146:04.19]If we don't work together right now, we're both dead.
[146:07.68]My death means nothing.
[146:10.27]Let's see how you take to a stand-up fight.
[146:24.26]Get in that thing!
[146:52.85]Your ships were coming to kill me.
[146:54.55]You gave me no choice.
[146:58.12]You killed everyone in my unit.
[147:00.25]They died still in the freezer.
[147:34.19]I did get dialog with this.
[147:41.06]He's bloody.
[147:41.62]He is bleeding right now.
[147:43.54]Bad.
[147:55.41]No!
[147:55.87]No!
[147:59.57]What a fucking move that was!
[148:01.62]No!
[148:14.17]Dude, go down!
[148:15.19]I did it!
[148:25.24]He's dead.
[148:25.90]He's dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead.
[148:36.04]Yeah!
[148:38.18]What has he got, some cool shit?
[148:41.76]A device with a button.
[148:43.94]OK.
[148:45.34]Can I take his gun?
[148:47.17]He looks like he had a better gun than I did.
[148:49.17]Can I have it?
[148:52.05]I can get that gun.
[148:54.23]A big gun.
[149:01.14]Can I take them both?
[149:06.75]Got an upgrade.
[149:09.41]Anything else on him?
[149:20.10]I'm going to take that heal.
[149:22.94]If that killed me, I would have been very mad.
[149:36.98]I think I have a heal already, don't I?
[149:40.64]I do.
[149:41.18]Okay, I'm going to use this.
[149:46.39]And then I'll refill it.
[149:52.60]What is that heal?
[149:53.62]How many points does that heal?
[149:56.63]Not a whole lot, but I'll use the whole thing.
[150:12.13]Yeah, use the whole entire canister.
[150:22.52]So maybe this blaster can kill the monster now.
[150:41.79]Should be close to full.
[150:44.03]Okay.
[150:45.09]Now, I'm going to replace it with this one.
[150:55.63]This one's full.
[151:00.46]And I got... I feel that gun's been so trusty.
[151:03.19]It's been so good to me.
[151:05.72]Whatever, we've got a big gun now.
[151:07.98]We're good.
[151:09.41]I'm going to put this on 1.
[151:28.48]How did he open this?
[151:31.65]Didn't he have like a device or something, right?
[151:39.38]Over three billion possible settings.
[151:44.52]With an M, million.
[151:52.57]Oh, would you look at that?
[151:59.25]What's this?
[152:01.01]Hold on a second.
[152:12.27]Which port?
[152:15.34]Starboard or port?
[152:21.41]Okay, I gotta get it in the right spot and then shoot him.
[152:29.25]Hey, just to let you know, the guide says this upcoming part is the most annoying part of the whole game.
[152:33.80]Okay?
[152:38.20]Good to know.
[152:43.37]And you click and aim it.
[152:53.18]I want it to go right there.
[152:53.94]I want this to go right there.
[152:59.88]I want that to go there.
[153:04.95]What happens if I shoot it?
[153:13.52]Whoa!
[153:13.70]That was insane!
[153:21.13]It's over his head!
[153:34.79]Is he just going to walk over to them?
[153:38.02]He's distracted.
[153:39.04]Oh, I thought I was going to get him right in the head.
[153:53.78]Did I get him?
[153:57.70]I feel like that was a you hit me with a missile sound.
[154:15.26]Is he dead?
[154:15.92]Cube.
[154:18.71]Alien cube, right here.
[154:32.90]He's de- I got him!
[154:35.89]I actually got his ass!
[154:38.49]No way!
[154:42.14]That's re- Oh, that's remarkable, I-
[154:46.09]I didn't even name this anything.
[154:48.43]Well, whatever it doesn't even name.
[154:50.01]OK, so just walk over his body.
[154:56.70]Still don't have a use for the bomb.
[155:08.49]Um?
[155:09.40]Well, we're going over here.
[155:15.90]Uh.
[155:21.19]Okay.
[155:25.70]Whoa, easy.
[155:27.16]There's my cube.
[155:29.11]I have nothing without my cube.
[155:36.26]Wait.
[155:38.54]This is back at the... Oh, okay.
[155:42.71]Okay.
[155:58.65]Can I not go over there?
[156:05.91]Is this a scenario where I have to bring the bomb all the way back here?
[156:10.47]Let me check over here first.
[156:14.12]The bomb is just still over there.
[156:15.72]I definitely have to bring the bomb all the way over here.
[156:18.37]And what is going on with this video game?
[156:31.15]I'm gonna get the bomb.
[156:32.36]I think that's the play.
[156:36.16]If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
[156:37.38]But it's fine.
[156:40.68]I'm picking up bomb and I'm gonna very promptly get over here.
[156:54.68]Okay.
[157:02.27]come on easy around the corner okay grab bomb and make a run for it make sure the cube is out make sure I gotta make sure the cube is ready
[157:33.24]Kind of funny that I have this fork in my inventory that I picked up in the first screen of the game and I still have no use for it.
[157:39.11]Four hours into this playthrough.
[157:56.03]Okay, don't leave the gun.
[158:02.20]I want to... I want to pick the gun back up.
[158:07.39]Do I have to leave the gun?
[158:08.71]That bomb is three seconds.
[158:22.04]I want the blaster.
[158:33.94]Can I not take the bomb and the blaster?
[158:40.05]Wait, what if I leave?
[158:41.05]Can I leave?
[158:41.57]I'm going to leave the gun.
[158:43.11]Okay, this is an experiment.
[158:44.49]We're going to do a little bit of some research here.
[158:50.74]What if I put the gun in front of the door that I'm trying to, you know what I mean?
[158:56.43]Put the gun in front of the place where I'm trying to go.
[159:05.02]Will it remember it was there?
[159:14.88]Worth a shot.
[159:25.73]Come on dude.
[159:37.62]I feel like that's going to be legitimate.
[159:42.91]I'll put it up here.
[159:49.77]Cube not work here.
[159:54.84]Oh no.
[159:56.52]Cube doesn't work.
[159:59.64]I guess I could get anybody there.
[160:01.40]Shut up, help me please.
[160:06.09]Somebody.
[160:06.29]So how do I?
[160:15.17]Can I climb that?
[160:19.80]He said this game sucks.
[160:21.86]No, it's not.
[160:22.98]You may have just showed up.
[160:25.04]If you had maybe maybe haven't just shown up, but if you have.
[160:29.11]No, it does not.
[160:31.89]We are locked in this game is.
[160:34.42]In the top 20 games I've ever played.
[160:38.92]Probably top 200.
[160:41.61]OK, let's see if that works.
[160:45.73]I'm gonna put the gun right here.
[160:54.24]I think I put down the cube.
[160:55.28]Alright, gun is going right here.
[161:00.14]Oh, you little assholes.
[161:02.61]Just ruining everything.
[161:05.05]Actually just ruined everything.
[161:08.27]But... I could shoot them with the blaster!
[161:20.34]I'm sorry, I have to.
[161:22.28]I'm sorry guys, there's just no way I'm gonna deal with that.
[161:28.52]There's just no way.
[161:44.06]I'll save it up here.
[161:52.57]He's... Okay.
[162:03.85]I'm... I'm getting... I'm getting a little angry at this.
[162:10.65]It'll all be worth it when I don't have to freak out running past this.
[162:15.14]It'll all be worth it in the end.
[162:16.00]You'll see.
[162:17.42]Trust me.
[162:20.08]Look at the shading effect going on over there.
[162:25.18]You need to chill out.
[162:25.98]You are about to get banned.
[162:31.32]I decide when I chill or not.
[162:35.01]Yesterday, this stream was called Chilling Out in the Freezing Chill Zone.
[162:39.67]I decide when that is.
[162:42.85]Don't tell me that.
[162:50.22]I'm gonna put it right here.
[162:52.23]Don't let me forget this.
[162:53.69]I will.
[162:54.59]Don't let me forget this is here.
[163:03.24]Oh, I thought I was going to fall.
[163:08.45]Alright, let's go.
[163:11.56]Take out my alien cube.
[163:16.01]I'm not going to save it here.
[163:16.95]I want to save it in a good spot.
[163:36.35]Sometimes you just gotta make sure that it works.
[163:50.33]So in theory... I... get... bomb... Put bomb in pocket... You have got to be kidding me.
[164:05.92]I should have saved it.
[164:10.02]I'm about to just leave the gun and just go because I was so confident that I could make that.
[164:17.41]I'm going to go in less than 30 seconds.
[164:27.68]I've got to practice this for the bomb run anyways, so it's fine.
[164:38.37]You can't be running to climb, you have to just walk normally.
[164:41.67]Remember that.
[164:45.24]Hey dude, a thousand people just left.
[164:49.98]Good.
[165:02.74]Alright, here we go.
[165:05.20]Now don't be an idiot.
[165:06.38]Save the game.
[165:35.74]This is like an Ambien dream.
[165:40.22]What?
[165:43.09]I just looked over at the view count.
[165:44.99]We gained a thousand viewers.
[165:46.18]That person was a liar.
[166:04.97]OK, here we go.
[166:09.78]I'm working on it.
[166:18.52]Alright.
[166:20.09]Can I hold the bomb and the cube at the same time?
[166:31.16]I'm saving it right here.
[166:33.12]Yeah, it's a good.
[166:33.60]This is a place to do it right here.
[166:42.82]See if this works.
[166:56.58]A bomb.
[167:02.81]Go.
[167:09.00]Okay, I get it.
[167:09.88]It's counting down.
[167:30.07]Clean dino run.
[167:31.84]Absolutely stellar dino run.
[167:34.39]That could have, we could have lost two or three seconds there, we're good.
[167:57.70]Okay, come on, come on, come on!
[167:58.74]I get it, I get it!
[167:59.70]I get it!
[167:59.92]Stop!
[168:01.60]I get it!
[168:02.32]I know it's gonna explode!
[168:03.64]Get off the screen!
[168:04.85]Get off the screen!
[168:06.13]Get off the screen!
[168:08.29]What the fuck?!
[168:10.87]I... I get it!
[168:16.88]No!
[168:18.52]It was a clean!
[168:19.52]This is the longest 13 seconds I've ever seen!
[168:24.89]Get off!
[168:34.89]I'm not looking at it.
[168:39.15]It's going to it on its own to show me.
[168:44.54]How's my mic, by the way?
[168:45.44]Is my mic doing that thing?
[168:46.80]I have the fan on today, so I made the mic have the noise thing on.
[168:50.96]Are we good?
[168:56.21]Okay.
[168:57.29]I got it.
[168:58.57]I could have saved a second or two after I got caught on the edge.
[169:06.18]That's so stupid.
[169:07.48]It keeps showing me the time that's left and sometimes it just, it stayed on it for like seven straight seconds.
[169:18.45]That's so stupid.
[169:20.65]Imagine having 20 seconds left and knowing where you need to run and just staring at it going, oh my God.
[169:26.42]Whoa, this time was counting so quickly.
[169:29.32]Alright, shut up.
[169:32.94]Everybody lock in.
[169:34.54]Yep, I get it.
[169:36.08]Good.
[169:36.32]81 seconds.
[169:40.25]I'm totally locked.
[169:42.59]This is a complete lockout right here.
[169:44.13]Boom.
[169:51.00]Need a good tail run here.
[169:54.79]Perfect.
[169:56.07]That's the worst part of the whole run.
[170:13.47]Good.
[170:20.47]Good.
[170:24.38]Yep, I get it.
[170:25.14]Okay, you have to escape.
[170:42.92]Okay, put it down.
[170:48.65]Oh shit!
[170:49.95]It's gonna explode!
[170:52.98]Get off the screen!
[171:01.35]Why would you sit there?
[171:06.95]Why?
[171:08.61]Why?
[171:09.29]Why would you do that?
[171:13.96]You can't be serious.
[171:17.88]You've got to hit... Okay, so just want to go over the controls real quick.
[171:22.27]The controls of the game are arrow keys, right?
[171:27.43]Turn left and right.
[171:29.13]Up and down to move.
[171:31.12]Holding shift runs, okay?
[171:34.26]We are all aware of this.
[171:37.68]To hit escape, I need to let go of shift and press escape.
[171:46.63]When you do that, you're not running anymore.
[172:01.30]Alright, I know how to make this work.
[172:03.63]Yeah, I know how to make it work this time.
[172:06.41]What am I thinking?
[172:08.07]I saw this pop up in the chat.
[172:09.64]Somebody said press R?
[172:12.42]I think this is the end of the episode.
[172:15.53]This is the credits.
[172:19.27]Let's go.
[172:23.60]This is definitely the end of the episode scenario here.
[172:41.84]Go.
[172:43.68]Roll it.
[172:59.01]Whatever.
[172:59.85]It was a fake episode.
[173:04.90]It was a fake episode.
[173:05.96]It wasn't a real one.
[173:07.36]This is the real end of the episode.
[173:23.98]It'll give me the strength I need.
[173:41.78]Open up your fucking inventory, dude!
[173:44.40]What am I doing?
[173:45.28]What menu is this?
[174:25.50]I'm lost.
[174:26.19]Bad.
[174:27.19]Okay.
[175:07.01]You dropped the... That was the cube!
[175:14.62]Was it?
[175:15.00]No, it wasn't?
[175:15.78]It was the cube?
[175:16.54]Wait, I am dropping the cube.
[175:22.57]Do I have to unequip the cube?
[175:24.65]Wait, hold on.
[175:25.15]Let me look over at the mod chat and see.
[175:30.26]Get cube ready.
[175:32.18]Grab bomb.
[175:33.95]Alien cube across.
[175:35.91]Climb.
[175:36.91]Before you climb the last block, unequip the alien cube.
[175:52.02]Okay.
[175:54.34]Alien cube, get ready.
[176:03.09]This is the one.
[176:11.22]So stupid.
[176:13.29]That's like when the guy's out fishing and he throws his phone instead of the fish when he catches the fish, you know what I mean?
[176:26.14]I got stuck.
[176:33.51]Get off my fucking screen!
[176:35.33]I don't have the cube out.
[176:37.21]Disaster.
[176:39.57]I thought I took it out!
[176:41.99]What the fuck?
[176:42.95]Stop doing that.
[176:43.97]Why is it... I have no idea what just happened.
[176:47.27]I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
[176:50.22]Can I salvage this?
[176:59.07]No way.
[176:59.53]Definitely not.
[177:04.31]Restarted.
[177:04.87]It's cooked.
[177:05.27]It's cooked.
[177:06.00]Yeah, alright.
[177:06.44]It's
[177:32.48]Here we go.
[177:35.32]Walk in.
[177:36.70]This is the one.
[177:38.48]Guaranteed.
[177:57.08]What the fuck is happening?
[178:00.25]Um, hello?
[178:04.03]Is my cube not out?
[178:06.98]Oh my.
[178:09.02]Guys, what's going on here?
[178:18.72]Alien cube, ready.
[178:38.27]We'll get it eventually.
[178:45.54]This is it.
[178:56.54]Lock in.
[178:57.66]Let's go.
[178:59.26]Lock in.
[178:59.91]Let's go.
[179:00.41]Lock it in.
[179:11.63]Get off the screen!
[179:20.60]Click it, you fucking fat finger!
[179:59.04]Cube.
[179:59.56]Away.
[180:00.92]Put the cube away.
[180:01.68]Is the cube away?
[180:03.21]I don't know if I... I pressed I. I don't know if the cube is away, guys.
[180:08.24]I have no idea.
[180:09.98]Can you see it in my hand?
[180:30.95]That's my gun!
[180:32.53]That's the gun!
[180:35.19]That's not... Why do I have to... Wait, was that my gun?
[180:40.76]Oh, no, no.
[180:41.44]I'm good.
[180:41.86]I'm good.
[180:42.26]I'm good.
[180:42.64]I'm good.
[180:43.86]I'm good.
[180:44.06]I'm good.
[180:44.34]Give me the gun.
[180:45.18]Give me the gun.
[180:46.19]Oh, my God.
[180:46.63]I need to save the game.
[180:48.07]Let's be fucking cool here, guys.
[180:50.51]Let's relax.
[180:53.23]Let's... Locked and loaded.
[181:01.27]Hey.
[181:04.89]Save the game.
[181:10.86]Let's go.
[181:22.11]Alright.
[181:23.53]Hey.
[181:24.61]I'll be right back.
[181:25.03]Perfect time.
[181:27.59]I'll see you guys in a few minutes.
[181:30.48]Yeah, I feel like time is just melting right now.
[181:32.99]Am I having that much fun in this game?
[181:34.60]It's been three hours already.
[181:36.53]Crazy.
[181:38.86]See you in a few minutes.
[185:37.80]What's happening?
[185:52.23]Welcome back.
[185:56.79]Let's keep going.
[185:59.70]I wonder how much that background really does complement the game.
[186:07.69]Okay.
[186:08.77]So.
[186:09.71]Recap.
[186:11.01]Bomb run was a success.
[186:12.85]I got my big gun.
[186:15.20]Blew that hole in that thing.
[186:18.60]And now... Let me go back.
[186:23.64]I should have full health.
[186:25.73]I have... Heals.
[186:33.05]Okay.
[186:34.16]Hold on a second.
[186:34.94]Let's take a look.
[186:38.15]I have a heal.
[186:39.77]I've got the flute still, which I haven't used.
[186:43.81]What do I have for damage?
[186:45.97]Full health?
[186:47.44]Like 55% energy.
[186:49.04]I'm good.
[186:52.14]Save it right here.
[187:04.89]What's in here?
[187:10.23]I look kind of messed up.
[187:11.37]Is this suit all beat up or am I crazy?
[187:29.29]Oh, it took the suit off.
[187:31.97]I'm back to being just regular guy.
[187:33.83]Well... Uh oh.
[187:43.42]You good?
[187:48.63]Oh my!
[187:49.03]I thought you were like a heal-bot!
[187:53.87]I thought he was a medical robot!
[187:56.36]Eat lead.
[188:11.64]And the gun is overheating.
[188:13.86]The gun is overheated.
[188:18.63]Oh, get away from me.
[188:25.74]I'll help you in a minute.
[188:26.90]I know, this might look odd to you.
[188:38.09]This is a long cooldown period for this to reload.
[188:44.79]Alright, it's back.
[188:46.00]You can tell by the blue.
[188:49.36]Alright, don't miss every shot, please.
[189:06.68]Big gun doesn't seem to do anything to these.
[189:14.83]Maybe I should just punch it.
[189:30.97]Really?
[189:41.79]Maybe they're indestructible?
[189:50.10]Maybe they're invulnerable when they're like this.
[190:08.84]That was an explosion.
[190:13.91]That was highly corrosive.
[190:17.35]Reactive.
[190:20.27]Who's this?
[190:25.40]Don't kill me.
[190:28.48]Mustafa shot me, the traitor bastard.
[190:31.83]He's already beaten you to it.
[190:33.27]To what?
[190:35.79]And he sealed me in.
[190:36.91]This place is now my tomb, too.
[190:45.04]What are you doing here?
[190:46.21]Are you still human?
[190:49.06]Or are you a machine?
[190:52.65]Are you their machine?
[191:03.58]I don't know.
[191:12.43]I need a doctor.
[191:14.32]I guess.
[191:14.88]Hold on.
[191:19.45]Hold on.
[191:20.85]I got Axe Body Spray.
[191:26.80]Here.
[191:35.87]This is wor- This is gonna work!
[191:44.28]Thank you.
[191:45.82]Let me rest now.
[191:48.80]You didn't take it all, did you?
[191:51.44]Here.
[191:52.62]Take my translator.
[191:54.28]Translator.
[191:56.21]Go to the alien temple.
[191:59.07]You will need to know what it says there.
[192:01.15]Oh, shit.
[192:01.63]We got an alien translation device.
[192:04.02]A part of what you are now came from that place.
[192:11.46]Did you use all my heals?
[192:14.79]I'm sorry about what they did to you.
[192:18.48]You took all five charges.
[192:20.38]You took all five huffs of the fucking healing thing.
[192:27.92]That's kind of annoying.
[192:30.10]Okay, well, I have the alien language thing.
[192:34.09]So is that it?
[192:37.09]Okay, well, let's go.
[192:41.58]Play the flute.
[192:42.66]Oh, actually, not a bad idea.
[193:00.55]I can't wait to see what this thing is actually for.
[193:02.89]Okay.
[193:15.83]So I got the translator now.
[193:20.32]Can I go in this tube?
[193:21.26]Whatever this is.
[193:28.29]Nope.
[193:31.33]I kind of want to shoot this to charge... I want to charge this back up.
[193:37.74]You know what I'm saying?
[193:38.78]I want this at full... Wait.
[193:39.82]Was it already at full charge?
[193:42.18]I don't know.
[193:42.48]Who knows?
[193:53.68]We're getting into kind of a laboratory.
[193:58.14]Holy shit!
[193:58.77]Something... Who's coming out of there?
[194:07.21]Alright, do I drop him down another well or do I just fight him?
[194:11.71]I do have a big gun this time.
[194:34.62]Everybody dance now!
[194:37.24]That was the same song.
[194:48.20]Don't let him creep up on me.
[194:52.49]He's a big alien too.
[194:53.93]He's a big guy.
[194:56.41]Alright, we're fully charged.
[194:58.70]Get out of here.
[195:02.30]3D movie.
[195:04.30]Want to make sure to get the audience involved.
[195:15.74]What?
[195:35.16]Dude, I'm sorry that I lose the Wi-Fi connection on the big gun sometimes, okay?
[195:41.98]It's just gonna be- it's a live service gun.
[195:43.81]It has to be connected to the fucking internet.
[195:47.14]Oh my god, I'm going down.
[195:54.05]Okay, well I know that happens now.
[196:04.25]Use the translator.
[196:07.19]Talk to him with the tran- wait, I can talk to him with the translator?
[196:15.49]Oh, I didn't heal.
[196:16.85]Wait, what?
[196:20.16]Didn't I?
[196:26.55]I'm confused.
[196:27.11]Um... Wait, where's my translator?
[196:53.95]You mean to tell me that the game bugged out and gave me my heal back?
[197:02.93]Um... Hog champion?
[197:09.40]Alright, I got the alien translator.
[197:14.13]Let's try it.
[197:22.97]There is no way to get out of the crater before the reactor goes critical.
[197:28.84]Unless you surrender, you are dead.
[197:31.93]Alright, let's translate it.
[197:33.21]Power.
[197:41.72]Alright, let's communicate.
[197:46.70]Does this hurt?
[197:59.86]that was not gonna work okay and it was a decent idea but we had we yeah we had diplomacy in our right hand and we had the war in our left hand and I aimed the diplomacy weapon and it didn't work so we went with the the left hand of war
[198:38.19]I gotta get some distance here.
[198:46.33]Where'd he go?
[198:53.56]Alright, run!
[199:23.58]Is he ringing a bell?
[199:41.91]Okay, now I can fight him?
[199:52.79]That was just banging on a snare drum.
[200:18.64]Oh shit!
[200:24.63]Already?
[200:33.03]Where's he going?
[200:34.03]Hey!
[200:34.97]Get back here!
[200:38.67]Where's he going?
[200:48.61]Where did he go?
[201:07.75]You're not getting away.
[201:15.42]What?
[201:17.20]Dude is literally running away.
[201:21.14]He's going into the portal.
[201:32.12]Okay.
[201:38.66]What's in this room?
[201:39.48]Can I get something in here?
[201:44.21]Maybe like an item in here, maybe.
[201:47.69]Maybe that's scripted.
[201:52.64]Yeah, there's something on the ground right here.
[202:01.77]What is that?
[202:06.31]No, not that.
[202:09.97]Put this down.
[202:11.35]What is this?
[202:15.64]Is this something I can pick up?
[202:22.71]Okay, it is not.
[202:36.55]Oh, hold on.
[202:44.68]Whoa.
[202:52.55]What should I do?
[202:55.67]There's an alien in here.
[202:59.18]Oh shit.
[203:00.40]Uh.
[203:10.29]What am I supposed to be doing here?
[203:28.52]I don't actually have to do this, do I?
[203:33.41]I've never been able to do a ripple shoot in my entire life.
[203:36.51]Ever.
[203:37.91]Not in my whole entire life.
[203:46.43]I need help with this.
[203:47.71]I don't care if I sit and wait for chat to tell me every single move.
[203:56.88]...
[203:58.81]This is absolutely fried.
[204:00.24]I can't do... I cannot do Rubik's Cubes.
[204:03.49]How do I move this section up here?
[204:07.44]These drums are... Okay.
[204:09.95]Can I turn... I'm going to turn the volume down?
[204:13.53]The basic idea is you have four Rubik's cubes patterns.
[204:16.73]The only ones that matter are the top and bottom ones.
[204:19.69]The two on the side serve no purpose.
[204:22.98]What you have to do is match the patterns of the top and the bottom so they're identical.
[204:28.81]Oh, yeah.
[204:35.06]That's going to take me all day.
[204:37.42]I just did it without... I did it.
[204:39.02]I did it.
[204:39.50]I did it.
[204:39.78]I did it.
[204:40.48]I did it.
[204:40.79]I did it.
[204:41.87]I did it.
[204:47.19]I got the alien artifact!
[205:03.04]I don't know how I did that, but I did it.
[205:05.60]What is the alien artifact?
[205:07.86]I have the alien translation device, and now I have an alien artifact.
[205:15.17]Highly conductive selenium.
[205:18.33]An unknown substance.
[205:19.54]Ornately shaped with rounded edges.
[205:22.02]Weight, nine.
[205:25.00]Ergs.
[205:26.53]Stop with the drum.
[205:27.61]Exhibits mild radiation.
[205:31.43]Alright, give me my gun back.
[205:38.00]A big gun.
[205:47.28]Okay, now we chase the alien to the alien world.
[205:50.17]I have the translator.
[205:51.67]I have the... necklace.
[205:55.89]I'm ready.
[205:56.70]What's my health at?
[205:59.96]It's... it's good.
[206:01.66]It's perfect.
[206:02.28]It's pristine.
[206:02.96]We're ready.
[206:06.27]You got anything else to say?
[206:16.38]No.
[206:16.60]OK.
[206:18.64]Good luck.
[206:22.38]I'm leaving.
[206:46.04]Alright, we're saving before I go in here.
[206:53.90]Do it.
[206:56.58]I'm so ready.
[207:00.63]Dude, how come the alien could do it?
[207:02.05]Do I need to use the alien artifact?
[207:09.02]Bet your ass I do.
[207:17.11]Take the alien tube slide.
[207:25.08]Dude, that's ballsy going face first.
[207:29.38]If you go face first on the water slide, wow.
[207:32.02]Everyone goes, holy shit, that guy's... That's ballsy.
[207:42.83]Alright.
[207:43.99]Are these things alive?
[207:56.26]OK, well.
[208:02.64]I hope that was correct.
[208:38.04]uh I I don't think I can move them I can't rotate them can I go down the other alien slides I don't know what I'm doing over here oh wait a minute look there's symbols above each one of these
[209:19.72]Okay, so how about that one's the top right, and then... Do I have to make that?
[209:23.85]See the symbols on the left?
[209:27.89]Yeah, okay, I get it, I get it.
[209:29.44]Let me see.
[209:30.44]So I need... Diagonal... Across... Diagonal, diagonal, down.
[209:37.69]I think that's correct.
[209:42.02]Diagonal... Across...
[209:48.88]Uh... I don't know.
[209:58.36]I think I'm close.
[209:59.14]I think that's actually what I gotta do.
[210:01.96]Look at the one on the left there.
[210:02.86]It's right to left diagonal, right across, horizontal.
[210:08.53]The one underneath it is top left to bottom right diagonal, top right to bottom left diagonal, and then one that goes straight down.
[210:22.85]But wait.
[210:30.94]Hold on, let me look at that again.
[210:33.04]Because that one has an empty space.
[210:39.35]Maybe this is right.
[210:42.94]Like would that be that one in the top left?
[210:50.50]I think that makes the one in the top left, right?
[211:02.02]I think so.
[211:03.08]And then the one underneath it.
[211:06.46]I'm talking about right here.
[211:07.21]That's like an eh eh.
[211:10.19]And then we need an eh eh eh.
[211:28.44]Would this be it?
[211:36.65]Use the alien cube.
[211:37.85]I have to do this part.
[211:43.42]I have to do it.
[211:44.56]I have nowhere else to go.
[211:45.50]I need to make a Y. Maybe it's this.
[212:00.26]No.
[212:08.81]Hey, please don't go bald.
[212:10.61]I'm probably going to go bald.
[212:12.03]Why do you... Oh, let me ask you a question.
[212:14.22]Why do you care if I go bald?
[212:17.10]It ain't your hair.
[212:18.04]Why do you care if I go bald?
[212:26.71]I don't care.
[212:27.17]Okay, I need some solution friends here.
[212:36.72]I thought I had it.
[212:39.64]Is... Er?
[212:41.17]Er?
[212:41.76]Er?
[212:42.87]Er?
[212:43.45]Is this a diagonal?
[213:14.08]wait a minute is it counting that it has to be the whole square so that would be correct am I stupid or is that no right no no no no because they have their edges are open let me look at the other ones too I want to see I don't think any of them have closed edges
[213:41.39]Oh my god, good luck with that one.
[213:43.27]No, none of them have- they don't have any closed edges at all.
[213:50.72]Hey dude, are you 40?
[213:51.50]I don't know, maybe.
[214:05.53]Whoa!
[214:09.84]How does that... How does that make this... This is like... Okay.
[214:16.01]You hear an alien shriek.
[214:19.57]I just spawned an enemy.
[214:28.26]Oh, shit.
[214:29.06]It's gonna be a gauntlet.
[214:31.01]I have to do every single one of these.
[214:32.17]This is definitely the end of the game.
[214:40.53]Games back in like the mid 90s, early 90s had a gauntlet.
[214:46.84]Where you fight every single thing in the game and deal with it.
[215:00.88]Come on man, stop.
[215:03.58]No, he spawned in a bad spot!
[215:09.74]Oh my god.
[215:11.23]I can't move.
[215:14.45]I'm stuck in an animation loop.
[215:15.59]I can't do anything.
[215:20.18]You dickhead.
[215:21.12]No!
[215:35.95]I just leaned my face in for him to stab me in the mouth.
[215:39.92]I'm gonna die.
[215:41.77]I'm gonna die.
[216:10.85]This is such cheese, but I don't care.
[216:17.54]Save?
[216:17.94]I ain't saving right here.
[216:18.90]This would softlock me.
[216:31.09]Good.
[216:31.93]Alright.
[216:32.43]I should be able to get this now.
[216:36.32]Run?
[216:36.84]I can't run.
[216:37.54]If I run, I trip.
[216:39.59]And if I heal, he'll stab me.
[216:41.03]It takes like 10 seconds.
[216:50.74]These things have so much health.
[216:52.00]It's ridiculous.
[217:04.57]You are such a piece of shit.
[217:05.91]I have to hit this.
[217:15.51]Wow, I had to do it.
[217:18.04]Had to do it.
[217:29.51]Dude, heal yourself.
[217:38.04]What are you doing?
[217:38.85]Use it!
[217:39.75]Do I not have any more?
[217:41.45]Why is another one spawning?
[217:46.45]Is this guy going to be up my ass the whole time now?
[218:00.29]Oh my goodness.
[218:03.79]Do I have invincibility frames while I play with it?
[218:14.58]It's not possible.
[218:15.88]I need to... Let me restart this because this is fucked now.
[218:20.18]This is fucked.
[218:22.53]Let me go back in the tube.
[218:23.57]That person, by the way, that told me... Hey, dude, try this.
[218:27.03]Yeah, I know who you are.
[218:29.82]I know who you are.
[218:30.68]I've read your comment and I did the thing you said to do.
[218:34.08]You're the south-east-south-west guy.
[218:38.35]You knew it spawned the monster, and you knew it was going to keep spawning the monster, because you wanted to have your little fun little time, where you could watch me have a little crash out, and I was told not to say that word anymore.
[218:49.03]But... That's why you can't sprint!
[218:56.96]Because if you sprint, you just go down!
[219:10.43]Let's try this again.
[219:18.26]Alright, well let's not do that one again.
[219:19.55]If you were a Dr. Seuss character, I feel like you'd be one of the butter on toast guys.
[219:34.89]Toast toast!
[219:38.93]I love it the most!
[219:40.77]Okay.
[219:41.55]Don't do the one I just did.
[220:01.23]Save it right here in case somebody tricks you.
[220:05.61]Wait.
[220:09.60]Put it somewhere else.
[220:31.16]Which one are we doing?
[220:33.49]I thought I had to do both of them.
[220:35.97]But I don't.
[220:36.45]I just gotta get one.
[220:37.31]Alright, so then let's try this one.
[220:38.71]Nope.
[220:44.60]Let me take a look.
[220:45.34]I gotta look.
[220:46.93]Alright, uh, I wanna do... That one down there.
[220:52.75]So it's... Yoink.
[220:55.76]I need to yoink, yoink, yoink.
[220:58.34]Got it.
[221:07.90]There it is.
[221:10.60]Yoink.
[221:33.64]This looks fun, I'm not gonna lie.
[221:41.82]This is a no gravity room.
[221:51.35]Am I shooting this?
[221:52.07]I think I'm going to try to shoot this.
[221:57.88]This is not the whole core of the place, right?
[222:15.62]This is impossible to aim.
[222:25.94]No, I want to... Get back in there.
[222:49.30]Hey bro, what's up?
[222:58.37]What's Virgo Libra mean?
[222:59.51]I mean, I'm meeting a chimichanga.
[223:03.19]Don't worry about it.
[223:15.33]I... that didn't work.
[223:17.70]Okay, that's not what you do.
[223:19.13]I gotta probably disable this thing.
[223:23.86]I can't influence where I go.
[223:25.20]I just float around.
[223:26.53]I'm gonna end up going out.
[223:29.17]You can't shoot it.
[223:30.06]You can't do anything.
[223:30.82]It's the wrong tube.
[223:49.27]Holy shit!
[224:06.45]Oh.
[224:08.44]Huh!
[224:10.10]The alien.
[224:10.66]The guy that ran away last time.
[224:14.99]Uh, I don't know what it means when he turns blue, but... He's gonna shoot this way.
[224:25.97]No!
[224:26.11]I didn't save it!
[224:27.33]I haven't saved it in a long ti- Is he even here?
[224:29.83]Dude, are you even in the room?
[224:43.15]Oh, he's impervious.
[224:46.87]Oh shit.
[224:47.75]Well, come with me into the low gravity room.
[224:50.51]See if you can handle the gravity.
[225:07.94]What the fuck?
[225:12.42]What?
[225:15.81]What are they making these grounds out of?
[225:26.60]Okay, well, fine, whatever.
[225:27.96]It telegraphed that the panel was loose?
[225:33.27]Yeah, but then it did a whole thing with, look at this alien that now has a super armor on.
[225:39.55]Alright, I get it now.
[225:40.37]I can get over there.
[225:41.36]Give me two seconds.
[225:53.95]Alright, the fun gravity room.
[226:09.40]Just do this, we can fly in.
[226:16.37]I need to use the propulsion.
[226:21.72]god damn it did you stop pretending now that's a Twitch meme from like 2016 alright you can we gotta you got a different one perfect going in
[226:49.69]I forgot this overheating.
[227:18.26]I forgot this overheating.
[227:22.51]Get a different gun.
[227:28.20]There are.
[227:30.26]Have you been watching the game?
[227:37.71]I think I'm going to get Luigi into the hole.
[227:40.13]No.
[227:45.78]Don't go in there.
[227:48.52]Here we go.
[227:54.49]Alright, bullets don't work.
[227:55.93]I ended up hitting myself in the face with it last time.
[228:00.81]Yep, that's fine.
[228:03.89]Drink your Fortnite chug jug, whatever the hell it is, and give yourself the shield.
[228:13.24]That's gonna fall.
[228:13.72]That falls.
[228:14.12]It falls.
[228:14.42]It falls.
[228:14.74]It falls.
[228:15.16]It falls.
[228:15.72]Get away from that.
[228:19.41]I must admit, your persistent will to live is admirable.
[228:27.48]He's blending in with the game.
[228:57.68]Make him fall?
[228:58.84]I'm trying... Hold on.
[229:07.23]Which one is it?
[229:23.37]I ain't fucking around here.
[229:42.91]Is that soft-locked?
[229:45.19]It's not soft-locked, right?
[229:47.26]I didn't take a step forward?
[229:51.90]No, we're good.
[229:52.69]He won't do it.
[229:53.39]He's not gonna do it.
[229:59.96]I think, are they all doing this?
[230:03.89]It's more than one panel, guys.
[230:05.65]Okay.
[230:12.15]Push him onto it?
[230:12.91]I can't... I can't move.
[230:32.95]No.
[230:33.75]How did I do this?
[230:34.57]I got out of this last time.
[230:38.80]Fuck this.
[230:40.54]Whatever.
[230:42.15]OK, now.
[230:45.27]The squid game.
[230:51.33]OK, get over here.
[231:07.50]Is there a reason why I cannot punch Cookie Monster in the face right now?
[231:11.45]What is going on?
[231:13.97]I've hit him every... I've hit him so many times!
[231:16.48]When will you die, damn you?
[231:26.23]I must admit, your persistent will to live is admirable.
[231:30.04]Yeah, I lost your shield.
[231:32.08]You were an admirable opponent.
[231:34.04]I almost regret your death.
[231:37.02]What's this?
[231:39.92]Key card.
[231:43.64]A shimmering cube.
[231:45.70]Another alien cube.
[231:48.45]What is it?
[231:50.91]Reflective cube.
[231:53.51]Cannot be evaluated due to reflective fields surrounding cube.
[231:59.98]Does he have anything else?
[232:03.92]I might need to heal.
[232:09.40]I know.
[232:10.14]Oh, for the love of God.
[232:21.78]Okay, we'll save it.
[232:22.96]Wait, I want to heal first.
[232:24.26]Do I got any more heals?
[232:47.49]How am I doing?
[232:50.03]I'm fine.
[232:50.55]I'm good.
[232:50.83]I got plenty.
[232:51.23]I got energy.
[232:51.69]I'm good.
[232:56.04]Let's go to one.
[233:00.24]Yeah.
[233:01.71]This is far enough away where I'm not.
[233:09.96]Okay.
[233:10.24]So let's check.
[233:10.70]Can I just walk through this?
[233:13.02]No.
[233:13.58]Can I use the alien cube to get through this?
[233:28.36]Yep.
[233:33.22]What's in the fire?
[233:38.45]Oh.
[233:38.65]Uh...
[233:57.53]Huh?
[234:12.47]Huh?
[234:25.06]Oh, okay.
[234:26.80]Green, red.
[234:30.33]Am I trying to make a color?
[234:40.14]Green, red, blue, green.
[234:42.53]Green, red, green, red, blue, green, purple.
[234:46.07]Yep.

[235:27.40]OK, now I forgot the whole thing.
[235:30.02]Oh, blue.
[235:32.37]Green, red, blue.
[235:34.61]Green, purple, red, blue.
[235:39.60]Green, red, blue, green, purple, red, yellow.

[237:33.16]Red.
[237:33.88]Blue.
[237:36.36]Green.
[237:36.50]Purple.
[237:36.98]Red.
[237:38.29]Purple.
[237:40.47]What's next?
[237:40.97]What comes after this?
[237:46.76]Orange.
[237:48.16]Green.
[237:48.90]Orange.
[237:49.68]Blue.
[237:50.24]Orange.
[237:50.60]Blue.
[237:50.96]Green.
[237:52.57]Orange.
[237:52.97]Blue.
[237:53.59]Green.
[237:57.65]Green, red, blue, green, purple, red, purple, orange, blue, yellow, green, purple, red, purple, orange, blue.
[238:24.07]What's after blue?
[238:30.71]Purple.
[238:31.57]What's after purple?
[238:32.87]Yellow.
[238:34.11]What's after yellow?
[238:37.54]Green.
[238:39.02]No!
[238:43.07]Green.
[238:43.21]Red.
[238:44.63]Blue.
[238:46.96]Green.
[238:47.68]Purple.
[238:48.24]Red.
[238:48.80]Purple.
[238:50.74]Green, red, blue, green, purple, red, purple, orange, blue, purple, yellow.
[239:04.86]What happened to yellow?
[239:14.99]Red.
[239:17.24]Where's red?
[239:25.84]Purple.
[239:42.29]Why did one guy say blue?
[239:43.66]You suck!
[239:45.62]I'll be back.
[239:49.48]You fucked it all up.
[239:55.93]I'll be back.
[239:57.02]See you in a few minutes.
[243:16.67]Green, red, purple, green, red, blue, green, purple, green.
[243:23.46]I lost it.
[243:33.85]Okay.
[243:39.27]Red, blue, green, purple, red,
[243:47.18]Purple.
[243:48.38]Orange.
[243:50.36]Blue.
[243:55.25]Yellow.
[243:55.41]Help!
[243:57.99]Blue.
[243:59.47]The next person that says, I want blue with Nightbot, delete it from the chat.
[244:05.24]I want blue to be a, you cannot say it.
[244:08.98]I want to make sure that nobody can say it.
[244:11.46]Delete it from the chat.
[244:13.50]It's directional, they alternate between the mirror.
[244:16.25]Delete blue.
[244:24.19]green red purple green red what's going on green red purple green what's happening I lost it green red purple red green purple wait I went I went a different way oh hell yeah
[244:50.29]Wait, I fucking, I had the whole thing almost done.
[244:53.62]Green, red, green.
[244:57.70]I'll get it.
[244:58.11]Green.
[244:59.79]I did the song.
[245:00.47]Green, red, purple, green, green.
[245:05.36]I lost the song.
[245:06.74]Green, red, blue, green, red.
[245:12.77]I lost the song.
[245:19.52]Hold on.
[245:37.26]Let me actually do this for real.
[245:38.96]So if they mirror when you use them... So why does blue go that way then?
[245:44.90]I didn't use it.
[245:46.06]The puzzle reset.
[245:48.78]It's every other use.
[245:55.79]Well, that didn't happen.
[246:06.66]Okay, so now... Blue should go down... Green should be correct, right?
[246:14.48]Okay, so now red should be correct, right?
[246:18.73]So now orange should be correct.
[246:21.59]Excuse me!
[246:22.45]What the fuck?
[246:35.34]That's every other!
[246:37.85]Look at this.
[246:38.69]Red is going opposite.
[246:40.59]Blue is going eh.
[246:45.11]Now... Green.
[246:52.42]Red.
[246:54.71]Blue.
[246:56.65]I got it.
[246:57.51]Everybody shut up.
[247:00.05]Shut up.
[247:10.53]I need total silence.
[247:16.55]Fuck!
[247:32.29]I can see the chat in the corner of my eye and it's pissing me off.
[247:35.46]I can already see what they're saying.
[247:37.06]I know how it works, it's just I'm getting crossed up because of the colors.
[247:41.97]Stop!
[247:42.35]Just leave me alone!
[248:13.21]But no!
[248:14.10]No, I thought it was going to turn that way.
[248:15.74]I thought it was going to turn.
[248:17.04]Oh!
[248:18.02]I... I don't know why I was like... If the cam was on.
[248:27.91]This is one opportunity where I wish the cam was on because my head was tilted to the left like 180 degrees.
[248:35.82]I don't know why.
[248:37.02]So in my eyes, I'm pressing top right there because my head is cocked.
[248:43.34]The one time that the cam would have made that way funnier.
[248:48.96]Damn it.
[248:53.93]Okay.
[248:57.25]Just, I need to reset it.
[249:04.82]Alright, everybody shut up.
[249:37.02]It's quiet.
[249:47.43]Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[250:01.23]It's crazy I was doing that like Simon at the very beginning.
[250:04.36]I actually would have just memorized it like an absolute weirdo.
[250:11.17]You can say whatever you want about me.
[250:13.55]I got almost halfway done with the whole fucking... Hold on.
[250:17.27]Okay.
[250:18.24]I got almost halfway done with the whole puzzle memorizing the color pattern.
[250:21.76]That's like 19 squares that I did.
[250:35.99]Um, what is that?
[250:38.16]I can't move.
[250:51.37]This is ET looking guy coming over here now.
[250:54.25]What do you want ET?
[250:55.55]It took you a long time to get over here.
[251:01.82]I hello.
[251:05.44]I don't know if what that means.
[251:09.26]But I can't shoot.
[251:36.58]Did we have to turn the reflective thing off?
[251:40.46]Hold on.
[251:41.88]Give me that cube.
[251:48.79]Now I can probably shoot him.
[251:53.98]I don't want... I don't want him to grab me.
[251:56.72]I feel like that's bad.
[252:07.10]Maybe he actually wasn't bad.
[252:12.17]I don't know.
[252:14.65]Maybe he was not bad.
[252:21.88]An alien battery.
[252:36.70]Good to know.
[252:37.70]OK.
[252:45.85]Where is it?
[252:53.12]No, it's in my hand.
[252:54.74]Try install it.
[253:03.66]Oh damn.
[253:10.21]make a new save here just in case do not use or soft lock oops wait hold on don't save I want to load
[253:41.89]Peace upon you, brother.
[253:43.63]Oh, he literally just said... I am speaking to you now with my mind.
[253:48.72]I shot him.
[253:50.12]I am Master Learner Jinn of the Fix.
[253:54.84]I am not your enemy.
[253:57.57]Your camp's failing reactor will soon destroy this entire world.
[254:03.99]I killed him on sight.
[254:06.68]What would you do?
[254:08.16]Everybody's been hostile.
[254:09.46]You must go to the gravity ring.
[254:12.53]It will be safe for you to enter there.
[254:16.12]The gravity ring must be cleared of debris and opened.
[254:21.37]After you have done this, get to the surface portal.
[254:25.77]Use whatever conveyance you can and save yourself.
[254:30.56]I see that you have learned how to operate the energy stasis field generator.
[254:37.03]It will protect you from most forms of energy damage and is airtight.
[254:44.02]allowing you to survive for short periods of time on the surface.
[254:49.89]Be warned, the generator draws its energy from the closest power source.
[254:57.33]In this case, you.
[255:00.39]As you may have already noticed,
[255:03.72]Your external weapons energy system is also affected by the field.
[255:08.52]This doesn't look comfortable to my guy.
[255:10.18]Here, take this portable energy source.
[255:13.07]Oh, I was going to say, I was going to shoot him for the battery, but he's going to give it to me.
[255:15.51]You will find it to be vastly superior to the one currently contained with you.
[255:20.20]I mean, I was going to get this no matter what.
[255:22.44]The fix must live on.
[255:25.70]Part of us lives on in you.
[255:29.61]I hope for your survival as well.
[255:33.30]Give me the battery.
[256:05.97]Okay.
[256:08.57]He's off camera.
[256:23.51]Dude, he gave me the battery and I didn't even have to use this.
[256:28.96]Cool.
[256:29.26]Okay.
[256:30.82]So...
[256:33.71]How do I... I don't think I can store the... I think I have to use the battery.
[256:40.16]Wait, wait, to avoid a softlock, avoid a softlock.
[256:43.27]I'm seeing softlock potential here in the chat.
[256:48.70]You need to keep that battery at 75% or more.
[256:58.09]So, this battery, I cannot use it to heal.
[257:01.74]If it's above 75%, I won't get soft-locked out of the game.
[257:10.59]Hold on a second.
[257:21.95]Oh, okay.
[257:22.89]So...
[257:27.58]You cannot keep the big gun and the extra battery at the same time.
[257:34.42]But you need the gun.
[257:39.39]So I have to install this battery right now.
[257:43.47]Let me... Hold on.
[257:44.14]Let me heal with the one I have on first.
[257:47.04]To full.
[257:50.48]Bad current insufficient for... Oh, hold on.
[257:55.49]Okay, so I'm at full health.
[257:56.79]Let me replace it.
[258:03.27]I'm at full health.
[258:09.63]Just don't get hit.
[258:11.80]If I need to, I can heal a little.
[258:14.16]But not really.
[258:14.86]And I would... Where is this camera?
[258:17.98]Can I get a better view?
[258:18.72]Of where... There.
[258:22.11]Where is it?
[258:22.79]Give it to me.
[258:26.27]I'm trying to pick up this fucking battery!
[258:28.26]Alright, alien battery is... Oh boy.
[258:34.94]Alien battery is in.
[258:36.18]Let's check.
[258:38.58]Dude, this thing's got 500 energy.
[258:40.17]Keep it above 75%.
[258:41.37]Where's my gun?
[258:49.40]I can take the gun now.
[258:55.66]Alright, to make sure I don't get softlocked, let me read this again.
[258:59.19]A big gun!
[259:06.56]You finally have access now to your arm gun.
[259:14.40]Go to diagnostic mode and activate the PFD prototype.
[259:19.82]Will that use a battery charge?
[259:33.92]Okay.
[259:35.26]This PFD prototype weapon is charged, uses one bar.
[259:40.85]I'm okay with that.
[259:43.61]Alright, let's go.
[260:00.25]I didn't- Let me look- What is this thing over here?
[260:01.67]Is there something I can touch here?
[260:09.04]I don't think I can do anything else here.
[260:12.38]Alright, let's go.
[260:17.03]So he said I had to clear the gravity field of the debris.
[260:20.19]How do I do that?
[260:30.08]Can I touch this or something?
[260:39.31]I didn't even try to play with this.
[260:44.54]Is this something I can do?
[260:45.52]No.
[260:50.33]Alright.
[260:50.83]Clear this of debris.
[260:54.93]I don't know.
[260:59.76]Oh shit, I can't shoot this.
[261:02.91]Uh oh.
[261:05.81]Um, I think I'm softlocked.
[261:20.64]Come on man!
[261:53.71]Why is the gravity field so much stronger on the other side?
[262:22.14]Get me out of here!
[262:23.82]I'm just gonna sit here now.
[262:47.19]Good game ending.
[262:48.85]It's pretty good.
[262:51.33]I think we are very close.
[262:55.25]We are... very close.
[262:58.74]Get in there.
[263:00.33]Get in the tube!
[263:11.06]Get in the tube!
[263:33.98]Alright.
[263:35.14]There are other things to open.
[263:36.81]What's this one?
[263:37.31]This one is a down?
[263:40.31]I'm talking about the one right in front of me, right here.
[263:43.05]I want to go in this one.
[263:44.88]So it's like a down horizontal diagonal?
[263:51.01]Down horizontal diagonal.
[264:07.85]Let me look at it again.
[264:08.69]Can you make that?
[264:14.76]That's weird.
[264:15.94]That's a weird one.
[264:19.67]Is that horizontal line part of it?
[264:26.18]Whatever, I'll try it.
[264:37.16]How do I even make that one?
[264:51.14]Can you make that one?
[265:06.00]What's the one right behind me?
[265:09.77]I can't see it.
[265:10.35]This one is horizontal and then one vertical down the middle.
[265:23.21]Dude, what are you doing?
[265:34.60]Use the pink circle on the wall.
[265:38.25]Help in an upcoming room?
[265:46.90]Yeah, that one's not working.
[266:04.37]I don't think that's it.
[266:11.72]Yeah, that's the top one.
[266:15.30]Pink circle on the wall.
[266:16.51]Hold on.
[266:27.64]Doesn't seem to do anything.
[266:34.83]Is this game any good?
[266:36.37]Should I buy it?
[266:37.12]This game is very, very, very fun.
[266:41.94]Alright, help me out with this one here.
[266:43.29]The one, this, I, I feel like I can't even make this.
[266:49.10]It's like a slash horizontal down.
[266:54.67]I don't understand.
[267:05.65]Slash horizontal.
[267:17.66]Which one?
[267:18.14]This one goes straight up and down.
[267:19.31]And then like this one.
[267:32.88]There we go.
[267:41.02]Why is this one blinking?
[267:45.21]I'm going to five.
[268:02.31]um hello just get in front of it it doesn't work okay well there's only one I haven't been able to go down but this one is horizontal and then of slash on the bottom
[268:41.95]Like that?
[268:50.87]Alright, let's do it.
[268:51.79]I guess I can do this one.
[269:14.08]Whoa.
[269:17.05]Asteroid failed.
[269:25.94]Go.
[269:34.55]That's not a place to walk?
[269:38.56]Um, excuse you.
[269:41.32]How is that not a place to walk?
[269:43.34]It looks like, oh, go down there and go to the giant wheel of fortune.
[269:49.21]That's just a fall.
[269:50.09]Okay.
[269:50.77]So, very cool.
[269:52.01]So, what do I do?
[269:54.88]I think I'm spinning this.
[269:56.14]Hold on.
[270:03.41]What the f- You can get hit by the asteroids.
[270:06.23]Oh, this is gonna be- This is gonna be miserable.
[270:10.92]What am I doing?
[270:12.46]I am trying to make... I think I'm trying to line the bottom one up with... Does it have to be all the same symbol?
[270:31.42]Or line up the blue lines?
[270:40.45]I'm going to line the blue lines up.
[270:46.01]Okay, so then let's go to the third one.
[270:49.06]Maybe I don't touch it?
[270:50.52]Okay.
[270:50.64]I don't think I'll activate it if I touch these.
[270:55.90]That's coming right for me!
[270:58.09]Quiet.
[270:58.99]I'm fine.
[271:02.43]Then it's this one.
[271:08.94]Okay.
[271:11.90]Wait, what?
[271:14.47]I gotta go so far?
[271:20.51]Hurry up!
[271:32.73]What's moving other ones?
[271:44.57]so what alright some of these move multiple at a time and good luck trying to figure that out while this asteroid's coming let me just do what I did before I'm saving it after every single one by the way
[272:36.61]Right when it hits the camera.
[272:48.09]Okay, now we gotta go to... I don't... Wait.
[272:51.78]Number three.
[272:52.76]Don't fall off the edge.
[272:59.95]Which... Hopefully that one doesn't move any of the others.
[273:02.06]It probably does, though.
[273:10.47]I walked into a shit.
[273:18.50]I'm so glad I'm saving it after like everyone.
[273:28.71]No.
[273:32.27]No, why is this moving this one?
[273:38.48]What is happening?
[273:42.61]Reload this.
[273:43.53]What the hell is going on here?
[273:46.16]Isn't that slot one?
[274:00.29]Honestly, fighting the game's con- playing tank controls while you- like this is so annoying.
[274:06.74]It's unbelievably annoying.
[274:09.65]It takes, like, five straight seconds to turn left and right, like, ten degrees.
[274:14.32]And then you have to press, like, four and it's- oh my god, it's so awful.
[274:40.68]Hurry up before a rock is gonna hook.
[274:46.01]It's coming any second now.
[274:47.65]I'm gonna get hit by a rock.
[274:48.97]Now wait!
[274:50.82]Will this move the two of them?
[274:55.12]Oh, that's not good.
[274:59.39]Oh, that's not good.
[275:02.07]No, you fucking idiot.
[275:09.28]Don't hit that one!
[275:37.70]This is like ripping teeth out of your head.
[275:56.58]So, which slot is that one in now?
[275:59.12]The third or the fifth?
[276:02.60]If I go to fifth, I think it's good, right?
[276:04.36]This one in front of me?
[276:09.10]Oh, shit in my fucking pants.
[276:12.09]Which one is it?
[276:15.41]Don't... No, I didn't want to touch this!
[276:22.94]I'm actually glad that happened, honestly.
[276:30.77]I'm trying to... Okay, so it's three... It's hard to even...
[276:35.51]One, two, three, four.
[276:37.82]One, two, three, it's this one.
[276:43.50]You asshole, don't do that.
[276:49.01]Yeah, I got it.
[276:49.77]It's pretty much done.
[276:53.90]I can move one on its own.
[276:56.20]Bingo.
[276:57.86]Now we move one, and we finish this damn puzzle.
[277:09.58]If I get hit with a rock, my fist is going through the computer screen.
[277:23.88]Nice.
[277:26.84]Put this on seven.
[277:34.29]Okay, should I fly out?
[277:38.03]I cleared the debris.
[277:41.16]Debris should be clear now.
[277:46.80]Game is saved.
[277:48.41]Holy shit!
[277:49.33]Imagine not saving and getting hit by that rock.
[278:01.84]Okay.
[278:03.47]There's one more tunnel I haven't gone in.
[278:07.09]And is it active?
[278:10.18]This one's blinking still.
[278:13.83]Do I have to activate the other tunnels?
[278:16.97]What on Earth am I looking at?
[278:18.13]I have a paragon!
[278:29.50]Unit 3 reporting!
[278:29.86]A section of the floor is just lifted away!
[278:31.15]Is that covered some kind of opening?
[278:34.21]Plane's advised!
[278:36.55]This doesn't look a problem.
[278:38.03]I'm gonna crush him.
[279:05.77]Can I not slice him up with the laser?
[279:33.63]What am I supposed to be doing here?
[279:35.75]He's leaving.
[279:36.79]I did do that.
[279:52.21]Wait, are you gonna go check it out?
[279:54.01]I hope he looks too.
[280:00.20]Unit 9 is dead.
[280:02.26]The hole was refilled, crushing him.
[280:04.92]It must be our target!
[280:09.50]It's reopened!
[280:11.86]I'm taking him out!
[280:12.26]Fire in the hole!
[280:14.44]What?
[280:20.23]Are you delivering a grenade?
[280:21.83]Oh shit!
[280:27.90]Wait, throw it back!
[280:28.62]Throw it back!
[280:29.10]Throw it back!
[280:29.48]Throw it back!
[280:30.20]I can throw it back in!
[280:32.10]Fuck you!
[280:33.08]Pick it up!
[280:42.17]Fuck you!
[280:43.15]Eat shit!
[280:49.30]Wait.
[280:56.51]Eat shit!
[281:02.00]Why did I think I could put it into the camera?
[281:11.60]I don't know.
[281:12.16]That was a long time.
[281:15.97]Are we in the right spot here?
[281:17.33]Okay.
[281:25.54]That is the longest fused grenade I think I've ever seen in my life.
[281:40.18]The problem, honestly, was that I'm holding all this stuff.
[281:45.88]Let's do it again.
[281:46.78]And this time, maybe it'll actually brush him in the first try.
[281:50.61]I have a paragon.
[282:02.64]Unit 3 reporting.
[282:03.00]A section of the floor has just lifted away.
[282:05.88]It's uncovered some kind of opening.
[282:06.81]Please advise.
[282:10.20]Check out the hole, but proceed with caution.
[282:28.99]Yeah, yeah.
[282:35.28]What's going on out there?
[282:37.02]Unit three, please respond.
[282:41.77]Alright, here we go.
[282:52.71]I got nothing in my hands.
[282:59.74]This should be easy.
[283:12.65]Take it back.
[283:28.27]Don't throw it back.
[283:35.34]I was hoping he was going to throw it back and we'd have to do it one more time.
[283:39.54]Alright, so this room is now safe.
[283:42.00]Maybe I should put the orb down.
[283:43.08]To examine?
[283:46.58]Okay, orb.
[283:47.41]Oh, no.
[283:47.95]Orb has to be up.
[283:50.13]Oh, that blocks the hole.
[283:51.13]I get it.
[283:52.00]I don't know.
[283:54.36]I'm thinking maybe I could go look at it from inside the tunnel.
[283:57.21]I don't know.
[284:02.92]Let's go with three.
[284:13.25]My weapons.
[284:18.54]I didn't put that cube down, did I?
[284:21.05]I think I just put it in my inventory.
[284:22.07]Yeah, okay, I got it.
[284:23.45]Alright, let's do it.
[284:25.00]Final tunnel.
[284:26.62]What do we do now?
[284:52.97]Nice.
[284:53.53]Am I dead?
[284:56.40]What?
[285:02.42]What?
[285:03.32]What killed me?
[285:09.83]I went too fast?
[285:14.80]No, I did not.
[285:19.00]A big gun!
[285:22.79]I'm so shocked by this.
[285:25.59]I need to see it again?
[285:26.85]Was that supposed to happen?
[285:31.82]Oh, do I need to put the shield thing on?
[285:36.28]The reflective thing.
[285:48.90]Yeah, you need to put... Okay, I gotta be in the blue outfit.
[286:04.79]Alright, put it on.
[286:05.55]Put it on!
[286:17.45]Okay.
[286:24.48]Put this away, get the gun, and I'm ready.
[286:31.98]It's still in Undead Burg.
[286:33.86]I'm about to leave Undead Burg and this is... We're at the end of the game.
[286:39.97]We're absolutely at the end of the game.
[286:48.24]I'm very excited for the climax.
[286:52.41]However long it takes, we will finish this game.
[286:58.42]Hey, I'm fine.
[286:59.48]I'm up.
[287:00.58]Alright, so let me check that they drop anything.
[287:08.03]Nothing on this guy.
[287:10.96]What about this guy?
[287:17.75]No, like, communication device?
[287:18.99]No, nothing.
[287:19.39]Alright.
[287:25.86]A big gun!
[287:27.83]Gonna put it at number one because that's where we started.
[287:31.08]Look at how far we've come.
[287:37.17]Do you remember when I rolled the credits for the first time yesterday?
[287:39.45]Man, what a great TV show this was, huh?
[287:43.38]Episode 1, episode 16.
[287:44.48]Remember episode 16?
[287:45.42]It was so crazy.
[287:47.04]I can't believe they had so many episodes.
[287:52.09]Okay, I'm just looking around.
[287:52.99]Make sure I don't miss anything.
[288:00.89]Alright, let's go.
[288:11.95]Can you translate this?
[288:16.03]That's a good question.
[288:16.79]Maybe I can.
[288:26.56]I don't think so.
[288:34.74]Whoa.
[288:43.98]Anybody know what happened?
[288:45.04]Because I don't.
[288:53.07]I thought there was a door over there or something.
[288:59.75]Yeah, the seafoam green is gone.
[289:01.69]Bing wallpaper took it over.
[289:03.02]I actually thought it matched a lot of the game.
[289:05.30]See it matches.
[289:06.78]It's been pretty aesthetically pleasing over there.
[289:16.47]So we're going to appear.
[289:18.57]Back on this.
[289:20.61]Oh look where it's going to take us.
[289:23.38]Interesting OK.
[289:34.26]Should I teleport over there?
[289:37.67]I think I'm going to have to teleport.
[289:42.04]So then from here, where's the... Back to the elevator?
[289:45.22]The first elevator?
[289:46.20]I need my cube.
[289:53.86]Turn off the... Yeah, turn this off.
[289:55.16]I don't need this anymore, right?
[290:07.13]Oh, okay.
[290:07.99]No.
[290:08.98]It's just toxic here forever now?
[290:16.15]You know what will be fun is counting every death.
[290:19.85]How and why it happened.
[290:24.96]I feel like I've died more times in this game than I have when I did my first playthrough of Dark Souls 3.
[290:49.49]Alright, say goodbye to the cube.
[290:51.47]This is probably the last time you're going to see our best friend.
[290:53.50]The alien cube.
[290:58.04]So cool.
[290:58.52]What a great character too.
[291:00.98]The storyline that the cube had.
[291:03.83]Probably the best character in the series.
[291:06.25]It's such a gorgeous, so well written.
[291:11.70]That not work?
[291:16.44]No?
[291:18.79]Uh...
[291:23.80]This way?
[291:30.44]Can I not do it because I'm in the suit?
[291:43.90]Uh, I don't know what to do.
[291:51.86]Can I climb this one?
[292:03.61]That's the right cube, right?
[292:06.67]Alien cube, right?
[292:19.85]That's weird.
[292:25.41]Was not in the right pixel to fly across.
[292:44.66]Can I go down?
[292:45.70]Okay, I was afraid to go down there.
[293:02.42]Cube?
[293:07.24]I can't make that.
[293:12.03]Am I stuck here forever?
[293:36.62]Cube!
[293:39.04]That is a not intuitive place to use the cube.
[293:44.49]Why wouldn't cube be from here to there?
[293:49.18]This is... It's from here to here.
[294:01.07]Let's get this saved.
[294:02.95]Go to nine.
[294:16.21]I'm so glad I saved it.
[294:17.33]I thought that was a ledge.
[294:34.07]Final episode with the cube.
[294:41.64]Alright.
[294:42.94]Here we go.
[294:46.96]Where am I going?
[294:57.01]Oh shit, I can fight you.
[295:08.71]Can I fight him?
[295:13.84]What are you doing?
[295:14.60]That doesn't count.
[295:29.38]I thought I was trying to go into combat mode.
[295:30.84]I pressed C and he just kind of stood there.
[295:40.60]Should I just drop the gun?
[295:41.66]Can I even use the gun ever again?
[295:45.18]Anybody, any guide Andes?
[295:52.47]Don't say Andy.
[295:54.24]Alright, I won't.
[295:55.22]Any guide...
[296:00.53]Any helpers?
[296:09.06]Get out of here.
[296:22.09]I blended with the environment.
[296:33.52]I don't even know where these kicks are coming from.
[296:57.52]He's trying to shoot me again.
[297:03.20]Alright, he's down.
[297:05.77]If you only knew what happened here, you would turn your guns on them instead.
[297:15.46]You have any items?
[297:19.70]A blaster.
[297:22.39]Ooh.
[297:22.49]Oh, who cares?
[297:25.85]A blaster.
[297:32.31]Alright, so is this... Do I go back in here?
[297:34.12]Should I go back in there?
[297:36.88]Is that where I'm... Is this where I'm going?
[297:48.82]I thought he was naked.
[297:59.67]Either way.
[298:09.39]Unit 12 reporting.
[298:10.85]I've got a bead on our primary target.
[298:12.91]Oh, Unit 12.
[298:14.05]He's hard to track in that reflective gear.
[298:15.99]What you gonna do?
[298:16.61]Nothing.
[298:17.05]Watch it, boys.
[298:18.32]Our friend seems imperfect.
[298:20.92]Couldn't stay away, could you?
[298:23.98]I'm gonna do some custom body work on you.
[298:29.97]No!
[298:31.55]No!
[298:34.33]Hold on.
[298:34.99]Let me... Give me 15 minutes to turn my body to fight you.
[298:40.51]a little present for you.
[299:14.58]Yeah, one more.
[299:23.59]Two more.
[299:29.57]One more.
[299:30.01]One more.
[299:33.28]Nice.
[299:34.68]Alright, he's dead.
[299:40.10]I said that line really well.
[299:47.38]I'll be right back.
[299:49.03]This will be the last break of the night.
[299:51.05]And we'll get to the end of the game at some point here.
[299:53.24]Probably the next 20 minutes or so.
[299:57.43]I'll be right back.
[299:57.91]Give me 2-3 minutes.
[300:10.53]Let me check my energy before I go.
[300:13.34]Okay, I'm... I've got definitely 75%.
[300:16.35]I'm low on health, though.

[300:20.92]Alright, here we go.
[302:25.92]I'm still here.
[302:27.30]Well, I just got some food.

[304:50.14]What a disappointment you are.
[304:53.64]One more failed experiment.
[304:56.72]When the reactor goes critical, you and this entire base will be disposed of.
[305:02.89]And soon, I shall begin my work again on my next test subject.
[305:09.08]Your friend, Dr. Escher.
[305:11.46]No, not Dr. Escher.
[305:13.70]Farewell.

[305:48.06]Right behind you, Unit 11.
[305:49.89]Lock and load.
[305:51.59]Establishing that they're good friends.
[305:53.85]They can die together.
[306:04.09]Hold on.
[306:33.55]Who wants some of this?
[306:35.57]The mud man.
[306:40.64]Man, man, sorry.
[306:44.71]Lots of trouble monkey shine.
[307:07.84]Gotta be frame perfect.
[307:24.36]Can you use the gun arm?
[307:28.08]Sure, how do I use it?
[307:32.81]That was just a fluke.
[307:39.17]I'm gonna shoot with my gun arm.
[307:48.75]Uh, I'm dead.
[307:52.82]Mission accomplished, everyone.
[307:54.44]The threat has been nullified.
[308:09.24]Come on.
[308:12.19]Am I held that low?
[308:15.95]Alright, I'm gonna use the gun.
[308:16.92]He's gonna... As he walks over here, I'm gonna shoot him with the super gun.
[308:31.92]Yeah, this is easy combat.
[308:34.48]Can you imagine if this was on anything besides easy?
[308:41.83]I can't use it that was just the first lesson from here on they get tougher yeah this one hard it would probably take half an hour to kill one enemy
[309:29.92]Be sure and send my regards to your friends when you get there.
[309:38.35]That's a spoiler for a Breaking Bad.
[309:49.67]My health is bad.
[309:50.61]I'm going to use the healing spray.
[309:59.76]What the hell was that?
[310:03.08]What's my HP?
[310:04.38]Oh, that's not good.
[310:06.03]Is there nothing left in this?
[310:11.25]Okay, I can heal a little bit, right?
[310:19.09]How much should I heal?
[310:20.31]I need to be at 70.
[310:21.03]What is 75%?
[310:21.61]How many bars?
[310:22.37]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[310:31.52]There are 30 bars.
[310:33.48]What is 75% of 30?
[310:35.02]10% of 30 would be 3.
[310:37.31]6 would be 20.
[310:44.74]So if I take this down to like 2 or 3 bars, I should be fine, right?
[311:00.90]That's still 75%, right?
[311:01.90]25 bars?
[311:10.88]I think I can go down to like 23.
[311:11.96]Or like 20, what?
[311:17.23]22?
[311:17.41]22 and a half?
[311:19.96]Okay, let me save it.
[311:33.94]You bastard!
[311:35.02]Come back here!
[311:35.90]Give me a ship.
[311:55.05]I don't even need a crew.
[312:03.25]Uh... Huh?
[312:06.67]They have a card on them?
[312:13.97]You got something on you?
[312:26.37]A log book.
[312:28.34]What's it say?
[312:29.44]The airlock is currently sealed.
[312:30.66]Locking pattern is in a two horizontal bar configuration.
[312:33.95]The grid is in a linear inversion mode.
[312:38.35]Okay.
[312:40.77]What does that do for me?
[312:46.40]Gonna be a weird puzzle?
[312:47.54]Where's my gun?
[312:58.11]Where'd my gun go?
[313:03.02]I got it.
[313:13.19]Oh, okay.
[313:14.21]Here we go.
[313:22.84]Horizontal and... what was it?
[313:30.16]So from the guide.
[313:31.74]So access the panel next to the airlock and the final annoying stupid no sense puzzle of the game will be revealed.
[313:38.78]You have to make two horizontal lines.
[313:40.71]This person writing this guide hates this game.
[313:45.19]You have to make two horizontal lines on top and on the bottom appear.
[313:50.22]So press a bunch of random buttons until you finally get lucky and unlock the door.
[313:54.36]Okay.
[314:06.08]Hold on, this is getting close.
[314:10.37]There's a bunch of random buttons.
[314:30.55]Oh, hold on.
[314:32.63]No shit!
[314:39.41]Wait, this doesn't actually, this doesn't make sense.
[314:41.56]This is weird.
[315:09.89]Yeah!
[315:17.92]Stupid final.
[315:19.48]Stupid piece of shit puzzle.
[315:21.51]Nonsense piece of crap fucking game.
[315:27.66]That makes it so... I love that.
[315:29.26]That's so awesome.
[315:39.97]Alright dude, where you at?
[315:42.28]I got an energy bullet with your head named on it.
[315:50.67]Remember me?
[315:52.93]The cyborg you created?
[315:55.59]I'm back with a vengeance.
[315:57.37]And I want blood!
[316:05.10]What floor are we going to?
[316:06.06]Floor three, right?
[316:10.16]Which floor?
[316:12.95]We're going to two.
[316:20.29]Where are you piece of shit?
[316:37.57]I'm here.
[316:40.17]And I got Larry's arm.
[316:49.55]Remember this guy?
[316:50.61]Wait, I left it here.
[316:53.53]That was the reason why I left it here.
[316:54.72]Because I would have got saw-lofted it.
[317:11.64]Let's go.
[317:15.73]Well, you need to go to the third floor.
[317:26.09]You got one guide.
[317:29.65]No, why am I... I need... I need the gun.
[317:43.67]What the fuck is going on?
[317:50.64]I don't need the gun.
[317:52.38]I got Larry's arm.
[317:53.34]I'm using the Larry.
[317:54.04]I don't care.
[317:54.42]I don't need the gun.
[318:03.97]Where's the elevator?
[318:08.76]I ran by it.
[318:17.28]Third floor.
[318:19.11]Here we go.
[318:25.84]Alright, let's send it.
[318:43.54]I'm getting off this damn world and nothing is going to stay in
[318:50.59]Nice shooting.
[318:53.07]Did you get your shooting license out of a Stormtrooper cereal box?
[319:04.87]Now you're messing with the elite special space forces!
[319:36.55]Kinda looks like I have a bouquet of roses.
[319:46.57]Now this is the last soldier of the game.
[320:10.95]He's gonna be hard.
[320:13.10]I can take his gun.
[320:17.48]I got a gun.
[320:28.12]Let's go, buddy.
[320:37.01]Hey, what's up, buddy?
[320:45.23]I can get my mech suit.
[321:01.50]I want the soundtrack on vinyl.
[321:03.35]That'd be kind of cool, actually.
[321:06.49]Okay, hangar data.
[321:10.31]Oh!
[321:13.42]Alright, I'm flying out.
[321:16.70]Is this it?
[321:17.56]Did I do it?
[321:24.75]Did I beat the game?
[321:26.11]Do I actually just leave?
[321:26.81]Can I leave?
[321:27.19]Do I need to hang our key or something?
[321:33.48]How do I get in here?
[321:35.29]Is there a door?
[321:40.81]How do I open this?
[321:41.34]Save the game?
[321:53.96]Are we going to actually see the actual end credits?
[322:06.29]Yeah, I tried to go on this.
[322:07.36]It didn't work.
[322:18.41]Need to put the battery in the ship.
[322:20.35]Ooh!
[322:23.88]Let's go.
[322:33.93]Is it the alien cube?
[322:43.66]You gotta take it out of yourself?
[322:47.54]How do I take the battery out of myself?
[323:06.17]I don't know.
[323:06.73]Yeah, what was the point of the flute?
[323:10.95]Oh.
[323:22.71]Wait.
[323:24.89]Hold on.
[323:25.83]The guy's walking like he's got a filled diaper.
[323:27.57]Hold on.
[323:29.70]Ah.
[323:35.32]There we go.
[323:40.15]Put this shit in.
[323:41.35]Let's get out of here.
[323:48.39]Oh yeah.
[323:49.47]Oh yeah.
[324:05.33]Cool.
[324:10.06]Do I actually have to fly the ship or no?
[324:13.02]I'll just go.
[324:26.31]Well, I obviously don't know how to fly.
[324:28.07]Maybe I do.
[324:54.37]They're going too fast!
[325:14.01]And they're red, which means they're angry.
[325:20.17]We've seen the credits roll a dozen times, two dozen times this whole playthrough.
[325:23.86]They were green.
[325:24.48]These are pissed off credits.
[325:25.68]That was wonderful.
[325:37.22]I loved it.
[325:39.26]I don't know...
[325:41.37]Kind of a weird ending.
[325:43.29]We don't get the closure on killing the bad guy or getting the ultimate bad guy.
[325:48.80]I wonder if they were setting up for some kind of a sequel.
[325:52.34]There might be.
[325:52.80]I don't know.
[325:53.52]Possible there is.
[325:54.11]Okay, well.
[326:04.86]Cool.
[326:07.55]And this is where we made it to.
[326:13.80]There was, but it got Bioforged Plus.
[326:18.89]Was projected by Origin as an extension of the original game, which would directly continue the plot, but it was canceled.
[326:25.36]Oh, man.
[326:30.08]Well, that was great.
[326:33.13]The game is right now.
[326:36.21]The game is $1.50, somebody said on GOG right now.
[326:39.75]Is that true?
[326:43.26]That's got to be the most dollar for dollar per hour of fun that I had.
[326:52.28]That was like 25 cents an hour to play that game.
[327:00.38]Less, like 16 cents an hour of fun time.
[327:10.40]What was the fun per dollar on Dracula 3?
[327:14.43]Well, Dracula 3 was not fun.
[327:17.07]So that was negative territory.
[327:22.34]The game lost an award in 1995 to Beavis and Butthead Virtual Stupidity.
[327:33.91]I mean, what you have to remember, Beavis and Butthead in 1995 was one of the most established, respected, beloved franchises on television.
[327:47.02]It was the Breaking Bad of cartoons back then.
[327:52.79]Beavis and Butthead walked, sprawled, ran, and won all of your adult animations that you like could have ever been made.
[328:04.77]So, I mean, it is what it is.
[328:13.44]I've even seen some of the newer Beavis and Bunnets stuff, and I was kind of scared that, oh, the new, and we are like 40 years, like 30 years later, and some of those episodes have been very funny.
[328:26.82]But they were great.
[328:36.39]Silicon Valley is amazing too, if you haven't seen it, Mike Judge.
[328:44.89]Gavin Belson is like one of my favorite television characters, I think, ever.
[328:50.44]Without a doubt.
[328:57.65]But, um, yeah.
[328:58.77]Yeah.
[329:02.23]Common Side Effects was Mike Judge 2.
[329:04.58]It's very good.
[329:05.82]Ooh.
[329:13.03]That's kind of cool.
[329:18.94]But yeah, that's going to be it.
[329:21.04]I didn't think I was going to play this for that long, but you know, I say that all the time.
[329:26.10]The whole point of doing the kind of old grab bag nights is to make sure that we get caught by one and we play it for like 10 hours.
[329:37.14]It happened with that Curse of the Eye of Isis game, the Mummy game, whatever it was.
[329:40.84]It's happened many, many times.
[329:42.87]That's the point.
[329:44.45]The point is to go until you get grabbed and then stick with it.
[329:50.27]And I'm glad we did.
[329:56.70]So yeah, I will be live again at some point, probably mid to late next week.
[330:00.95]Well, I mean, it's next week tomorrow.
[330:04.17]I think we're going to do some co-op stuff.
[330:08.58]I think we've got some horsemen maybe that are going to be doing something maybe on Thursday.
[330:14.99]So at the very least, I'll see you on Thursday.
[330:24.21]Have a great rest of your night.
[330:27.59]It is pretty late for a lot of you, I know that.
[330:31.40]Because when it gets to be more than 10, 11 o'clock Pacific, then whoa.
[330:40.03]You know.
[330:46.02]Thanks for hanging out.
[330:46.70]Thanks for chilling.
[330:47.44]Thanks for sticking around.
[330:50.86]And you know, whatever.
[330:53.77]I got so many of these to play.
[330:58.52]For every Bioforge, there are a thousand, thousands of others that I have access to.
[331:09.13]So, we'll just do them whenever I feel like it, right?
[331:25.62]You crashed my internet three hours into the stream.
[331:30.80]Sorry, dude.
[331:32.86]Do you research the games beforehand?
[331:35.20]Um, sometimes I have to.
[331:37.33]Because sometimes they require you to install certain things or to do certain tweaks.
[331:44.89]So a lot of these games actually take a little bit more than just installing them to run.
[331:52.52]Same thing with the old console stuff.
[331:55.87]Where sometimes some of those discs were weird.
[331:57.69]I don't like emulation.
[331:59.22]There's tons of emulation that I can do.
[332:01.48]And I've done it before.
[332:02.40]I have done emulation before.
[332:04.64]But my philosophy always was if a game is readily available somewhere and it works, I was always going to do that first.
[332:20.11]DOSBox has changed everything.
[332:23.33]It's changed the game completely.
[332:28.04]So a game, for instance, like this, this game is very old, but it's still available.
[332:35.92]And it's only a few dollars, right?
[332:37.22]It's not emulating a game like Bioforge, I think.
[332:40.61]It's like, I mean, dude, it's $1.50.
[332:42.67]It's $2.00.
[332:44.88]I'll just get that and just play the GOG one, right?
[332:48.34]But in cases where you can't get it anywhere, it's impossible, the copies don't exist, or there's like 10 in existence, or it's very difficult to sort, then of course, then you go down that road, right?
[333:00.22]But I've always kind of had that philosophy.
[333:14.83]He's a philosopher!
[333:27.66]You gonna play Deltarune?
[333:30.21]Hey.
[333:31.65]Let me tell you.
[333:33.05]I don't think I'm gonna play Deltarune on stream.
[333:35.61]Sorry.
[333:36.64]I'm gonna have to tell you.
[333:38.94]Probably not gonna happen.
[333:48.61]I don't even... Honestly, I haven't even played through the first two chapters again.
[333:53.89]And I said I wanted to do that first.
[333:55.27]I hadn't even started.
[333:57.43]I haven't even begun to do that.
[333:59.56]So I have to do that first, even thinking about playing the other chapters.
[334:03.61]I haven't even played them.
[334:04.21]I don't even know what they are.
[334:06.52]But I don't think I'll spare them.
[334:20.07]Why are you such a hater?
[334:22.87]Delta Run is awesome.
[334:24.05]I just don't know if I want to stream it.
[334:26.38]I might just play it.
[334:28.78]You sure you're not a hater?
[334:31.82]Hey.
[334:33.42]Internalize that.
[334:40.69]Alright, see you later.
[334:41.47]Take care of yourselves.
[334:43.32]Have a great one.
[334:44.10]Goodbye.
[334:44.62]Goodnight.
[334:45.32]See you later.
[334:48.24]Goodbye.
