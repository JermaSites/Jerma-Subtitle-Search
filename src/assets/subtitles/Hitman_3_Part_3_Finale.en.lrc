[00:01.08]Pretty cool.
[00:02.80]What's up?
[00:08.49]Clap, clap.
[00:09.35]One time on time Andy.
[00:15.27]One time on time Andy.

[00:19.53]How you guys doing?
[00:26.31]Hope you're doing well.

[00:31.09]Give me one sec.
[01:00.56]Okay.
[01:02.74]Neander's is playing the PowerWash Simulator.
[01:08.08]I saw that.
[01:08.64]Yeah.
[01:09.86]Does it suck?
[01:14.24]Is it a shitty game?
[01:18.30]Or is it good?
[01:20.61]I'm going to have to get a little review here.
[01:22.11]Are you going to try the Don't Starve mod?
[01:28.03]Wait, what?
[01:32.69]Why did you have sub only mode on you fucking what?
[01:35.39]What are you talking about?
[01:37.92]Yesterday?
[01:38.40]What I can't turn on sub only so I already explained it.
[01:44.64]Did that person wait of 24 hours to say that?
[01:51.85]That must have been in your text box.
[01:55.91]You ever text somebody and you just kind of give up halfway through?
[01:59.78]like three or four days go by and you like open up your that person's message and you go oh I was gonna write this enter you must have just done that yes I did did you that's so funny if that no no way do you have like a tab open
[02:27.16]Jeremy, please.
[02:27.98]Jeremy, please.
[02:29.24]Sing me a song, please.
[02:32.02]No, not everybody gets a song.
[02:38.35]On time Andy.
[02:39.97]A billion off the debt.
[02:43.53]That would be pretty cool, actually.
[02:45.57]I should have done it.
[02:47.37]God damn it.
[02:49.39]Yesterday, I should have said...
[02:52.24]Hey, today, by the way, if I get exactly 359 live, it's a billion off the debt.
[02:58.98]Oh, well.
[03:01.26]Missed my opportunity.
[03:07.50]No deal?
[03:07.90]Well, that's alright.
[03:09.94]We're going to finish Hitman 3 today.
[03:12.35]I have, I think, two more missions, but one more real mission and then like a finale or something from my understanding.
[03:22.34]You're late.
[03:26.68]Shitman 3.
[03:30.01]Sing the Hitman 3 song.
[03:39.48]It's all about songs with you guys, isn't it?
[03:42.36]It's all about songs.
[03:45.24]Everything has a song now.
[03:47.96]You're going to sing the toothbrushing song.
[03:49.50]Well, that's a very important one because you need to brush your teeth for two minutes.
[03:55.01]So, I mean, I would do that one for you.
[03:57.21]Let me get to the lyrics for it.
[04:05.53]So use this for when you're brushing your teeth.
[04:07.15]Okay.
[04:14.67]Here we go.
[04:21.66]Start it now.
[04:22.45]It has to last two minutes.
[04:26.20]Very important that you listen to this while you brush.
[04:30.66]Brush, brushy brush, brushy brush, brush.
[04:33.88]Brush, brushy brush, brushy brush, brush.
[04:36.31]Brushy brush them up and down.
[04:38.31]Brushy brush brush them round and round.
[04:40.95]To keep teeth healthy, here's the truth.
[04:43.45]You gotta brush each and every single tooth.
[04:46.43]The teeth in the back get a lot of wear, so don't forget to wash back there.
[04:51.37]Brush, brushy brush, brushy brush, brush, brush your teeth.
[04:54.73]Keep them looking clean and neat.
[04:56.71]Brush, brushy, brush, brush, brush, brush.
[04:58.89]Brush your teeth every day and night.
[05:01.52]Now your toothpaste may taste good when you've got it in your mouth.
[05:06.32]Elmo, that's not right.
[05:07.84]Toothpaste sucks.
[05:09.56]But you should never swallow it.
[05:10.92]You gotta spit it out.
[05:12.39]Go on and spit.
[05:13.43]We'll wait it out.
[05:15.15]Brush your teeth.
[05:15.95]Keep them looking clean and bright.
[05:17.49]Brush, brushy, brush, brush.
[05:18.93]That's alright.
[05:20.05]Brush, brush, brush every day and night.
[05:22.77]Now, if your parents heard, here's what you've got to do.
[05:25.84]Let them get your toothbrush so they can brushy brush your teeth.
[05:28.76]Great job.
[05:29.50]Looks like you're almost done.
[05:31.00]What?
[05:32.30]Five, four, three, two, one.
[05:35.16]Now spit.
[05:39.42]That song's terrible.
[05:42.94]That's like Elmo's teeth brushing song.
[05:44.36]That song sucks.
[05:50.68]Anyways.
[05:53.89]Wait, if your parents hear you, get them to brush your teeth for you?
[05:57.83]That's the end of the song, Elmo.
[06:00.25]That's at the third... That's at the final third of the song.
[06:05.70]Two minutes.
[06:06.72]Elmo, you have the parent line be the first two lines.
[06:09.74]You just plagiarized Sesame Street.
[06:18.78]Let's go.
[06:24.16]plagiarize I didn't plagiarize Sesame Street I just told you I was reading you something from Sesame Street I mean so that I was giving you the source that's the source plagiarizing means I pretended that I just made that song up and I didn't take it from Elmo

[07:26.58]That's perfect.
[07:28.15]And let's go.
[07:31.73]Give us a recap.
[07:32.73]We're meeting Diana.
[07:34.09]You know, 47, this is Diana.
[07:35.78]We're meeting her at a ledge.
[07:39.34]Because there's a bad guy that's trying to kill us both.
[07:43.14]So now we're meeting in an undisclosed location.
[07:46.53]So we can try to kill that guy.
[07:49.07]And get him.
[07:50.37]Because he's trying to get us.
[07:52.11]And I just explained.
[07:53.63]Power is a thing.
[07:54.52]There you go.
[07:55.92]Power is a thing, and some people grab it, some people miss their opportunity to grab it, and some people reach for it their whole life, but it's a thing that you can get.
[08:02.86]There you go.
[08:10.43]And for those of you that weren't here yesterday, I'm going to go ahead and do the exact same job I did last night.
[08:15.89]I just killed Diana with one shot.
[08:17.69]I killed her.
[08:19.39]She's still alive.
[08:20.57]Well, that person's dead instead.
[08:22.49]I think I can still do it.
[08:30.46]Alright, if you weren't here yesterday, we're gonna start with that one.
[08:32.71]Alright, so it doesn't matter.
[08:37.15]No, wait.
[08:37.47]No, you want to see the beginning.
[08:39.64]No, don't re-plan the mission.
[08:44.30]He took so many.
[08:45.96]Oh, fuck.
[08:46.60]This dude's out of material.
[08:48.21]No, I just started.
[08:49.35]Give me a second.
[08:58.11]Hold on.
[08:58.75]What's going on here?
[08:59.56]We've got a link.
[09:01.04]Is this a link spam day today?
[09:05.24]What the fuck?
[09:08.16]This is a fucking paragraph, dude.
[09:10.00]This is like an essay.
[09:14.61]Hold on.
[09:19.01]I'm gonna read this.
[09:33.93]Um, what the hell?
[09:39.63]Okay.
[09:41.44]So, um, okay.
[09:46.16]Jeremy, this is your principal from Clown High speaking, Principal Bubbles.
[09:50.66]Hi, Principal Bubbles.
[09:51.96]I've been watching your Hitman 3 streams and I've been very underwhelmed, okay?
[09:55.97]I know you can do better than zero stars every mission, so I want to cut you a deal.
[10:00.29]For this next mission, the score you get at the end in the detailed score tab is how much I would like to remove from your debt times 100.
[10:08.58]However, you kill one innocent man and get even one point of a negative score, the money you receive is null and instead we will add to your debt the amount that was penalized, also times 100.
[10:20.97]Loading a save if you have to is fine, but no blatant saves coming.
[10:27.08]We trust that you'll be a good person, Mr. Elbertson.
[10:29.58]You always were the best in the clown class.
[10:32.14]If you accept, you can also choose to double or triple the rewards and penalties from the bet.
[10:37.96]We believe in you.
[10:39.29]Valedictorian of the Clown Class of 2004.
[10:40.75]Thank you, Principal Bubbles.
[10:45.97]And I really wish I didn't get suspended that time that I squirted the water in your face with the flour on my blouse.
[10:54.14]And everyone laughed at that but you.
[10:56.96]And I got suspended.
[10:58.06]So, I mean, you're going to cut me a deal here.
[10:59.80]That's fine.
[11:00.18]Is that a deal?
[11:05.16]I have to be very, very honest with everybody here.
[11:07.43]This is the truth.
[11:10.53]The absolute truth.
[11:13.00]I've played every single Hitman, all of them.
[11:16.36]Contracts, Blood Money, Hitman 1, Hitman 2.
[11:19.46]The Hitman Absolution.
[11:21.64]The new reimagining of this last trilogy here.
[11:24.57]Hitman, Hitman 2, Hitman 3 here.
[11:27.83]I have, I don't think ever, not one time, ever, in two decades, gotten more than zero stars on a mission.
[11:41.57]I've never gotten more than zero in two decades of playing this game.
[11:46.03]This franchise.
[11:49.01]I don't even know how to properly play this game.
[11:51.62]I don't even understand it.
[11:53.80]So, that's a very bad deal for me to take.
[11:56.48]Very bad.
[11:57.76]Very bad.
[12:03.63]I don't know if I can do it.
[12:05.43]You're talking about a one in a million chance that I will get this right.
[12:08.51]I've played every single one of these and I end up having to, like, throw a guy over a balcony.
[12:13.93]Or, like, shoot some lady because she was in the way.
[12:16.61]It's gonna happen.
[12:18.19]It's not easy for me.
[12:19.58]Should I do it?
[12:20.60]Okay.
[12:22.36]Times a hundred?
[12:23.04]Ugh.
[12:27.26]Alright.
[12:27.86]Let me ask you a question.
[12:29.32]Can I do... Can I get...
[12:32.96]A save file.
[12:35.22]Where I save and I can go to that save and just like fucking throw a grenade.
[12:38.96]Like can I do that?
[12:39.60]Like can I get it out of my system?
[12:45.00]Or just do I have to just do it from now on and do good on the mission?
[12:50.12]Like can I have like a comedy save file and then like the regular save file?
[12:58.17]No, it's from now on.
[13:00.30]You get a comedy save.
[13:01.44]Okay.
[13:02.90]So I get one comedy save.
[13:07.50]All jokes are allowed.
[13:08.54]This seems very elaborate.
[13:10.22]We need to have a consensus here.
[13:14.00]You have to say it's a comedy save.
[13:18.21]So like if I say this is a comedy save I'm making right now, I can throw a grenade at somebody.
[13:23.31]Do we have a...
[13:25.49]I'm allowed one comedy save for this whole mission.
[13:30.05]Okay.
[13:32.33]Yes.
[13:38.08]Yes, one comedy save.
[13:39.78]Unfunny stream.
[13:40.84]Wait, I just started.
[13:41.92]Come on, dude.
[13:45.04]What the fuck?
[13:47.22]I haven't even started.
[13:48.52]I'm like blocking out a deal.
[13:55.04]Wait, because now, here's the thing, now a lot of you guys are concerned now, because now I'm not going to just throw grenades at people, I'm not going to throw people to balconies, and I'm not going to, like, trap somebody, like, in, like, the kitchen and throw plates at them.
[14:05.75]Now you're like, oh, shit, this is the gaming, he's going to be, like, gaming on this stream?
[14:10.11]Only 13% of the people from the census even wanted this in the first place.
[14:14.21]I'm going for it, let's go.
[14:16.77]I accept the agreement.
[14:18.63]I get one comedy save.
[14:21.58]I get one comedy save, and the rest is I have to play Hitman.
[14:25.84]I'm going to do the best I possibly fucking can.
[14:30.76]And that's times 100 at the end?
[14:32.89]It's the hardest I'm ever going to try in a video game.
[14:37.35]Does it go?
[14:38.21]Let me get something out of my... It's not starting now?
[14:42.85]Is it starting now?
[14:43.47]It's starting right now, but wait.
[14:48.87]This doesn't count as a comedy save, right?
[14:50.29]Put that away!
[14:51.71]Not right now.
[14:52.65]Can I start it right now?
[14:56.81]Not yet.
[14:57.13]Doesn't start yet.
[14:57.71]When does it start?
[14:58.57]When does it actually start?
[15:01.20]Starts right now.
[15:01.78]Okay, right now.
[15:02.30]Alright, alright, alright.
[15:02.96]Let's go.
[15:06.44]I want to throw off so bad.
[15:07.60]I want to push her over the edge so bad.
[15:10.95]I have one comedy save.
[15:12.31]I have to make it count.
[15:13.65]You'd never get caught on camera.
[15:15.71]Not unless you wanted to be seen.
[15:18.15]So what's the play?
[15:19.03]Put the facecam on or no deal?
[15:20.77]I'm not the only one who's been busy, 47.
[15:24.40]I'm this... Okay.
[15:27.42]We already saw that.
[15:29.36]It has to be a facecam for this.
[15:30.50]Why?
[15:30.66]I don't have to prove I'm looking at the screen.
[15:32.64]Why do I have to prove that I'm looking at the screen for?
[15:43.70]Or it's pre-recorded.
[15:46.52]Oh, get out of here.
[15:48.77]Okay, fine.
[15:58.19]You could be doing a walkthrough.
[15:59.25]Okay.
[16:02.81]It's times a hundred, right?
[16:10.99]Come find me when it's done.
[16:12.99]Good luck 47.
[16:13.39]Alright, I'm gonna try really fucking hard.
[16:18.28]Eliminate Tamara.
[16:20.42]Eliminate Dawn Archibald.
[16:22.08]Do not eliminate Diana Burnwood.
[16:24.48]Unless you make a comedy save file right now.
[16:29.38]Too early.
[16:30.60]Let's go.
[16:35.08]But the guy with the camera!
[16:38.62]But the guy with the camera!
[16:45.99]This is not a comedy save.
[16:47.15]Alright.
[16:47.87]Slot one is regular save.
[16:50.05]Slot two... Can I have three comedy saves?
[16:52.95]Please.
[16:53.21]Can I please have three comedy save files?
[16:58.85]Three... One is not enough.
[17:07.46]Three.
[17:10.06]Okay.

[17:47.80]I want to just.
[17:48.56]I don't know what to do.
[17:58.18]The person's smoking a cigarette.
[17:59.46]I'm going to throw a cigarette at them.

[18:03.09]Smack cell phone out of his hand.

[18:23.88]I'm going to start to pay attention because I need to get a good score.
[18:27.60]Okay.
[18:28.16]You know.
[18:32.73]Can I disguise as one of those guys?
[18:44.65]Eliminate them both.
[18:45.49]Where are they?
[18:46.81]Inside there, up there.
[18:47.83]Oh, I want to get in front of them.
[18:50.63]I want to pretend like I'm the singer of the band.
[18:53.92]This is not going to deduct points.
[18:55.00]I can still do things like that.
[19:01.20]I don't understand.
[19:02.14]I did not understand any of that.
[19:03.80]I'm sorry.
[19:26.36]What about in here?
[19:28.18]Do not eliminate Diana Burnwood.
[19:30.26]Well, that's so easy.
[19:31.35]She's... Oh, she's coming to the party.
[19:36.67]She's gonna stand.
[19:40.15]She's... Can I dance with her?
[19:47.64]May I have this dance?
[19:56.00]Oh, okay.
[19:56.78]Are we going to work together?
[19:58.15]Do I know him?
[20:03.05]Excuse me.
[20:03.73]May I... May I... Excuse me.
[20:12.76]May I... Not going to... No, I'm going to queue.
[20:19.98]Ah, Miss Birdwood.
[20:22.03]Mr. Yates said you'd be dropping by.
[20:23.86]Are you ready for the grand tour?
[20:25.28]Who else will be attending?
[20:26.42]Good today, sir.
[20:28.66]Just yourself, Miss Vidal, and a Mr. Cornwall Black.
[20:33.09]Is that me?
[20:33.63]An employee of Mr. Gates from the New York office.
[20:36.41]He hasn't checked in with us yet.
[20:38.31]Would you like us to call him for you?
[20:39.87]That won't be necessary.
[20:41.29]Mmm, I'm gonna disguise as that guy.
[20:48.04]I would laugh so hard if she just turned to me when I pressed F1.
[20:50.38]Like her head just turns and she's like, 47, we have a new lead.
[20:53.12]Oh.
[21:00.36]Okay.
[21:00.46]Well, cool.
[21:00.82]Okay.
[21:20.38]Okay.
[21:20.56]Oh, if I push her over the edge, it won't kill her, but it'll be funny.
[21:24.00]Imagine just like a somersault over the railing.
[21:27.14]This is a gamer save, by the way.
[21:29.29]I want to make that really clear.
[21:49.38]They're playing music really loudly.
[21:53.27]Alright, what do we got?
[21:54.27]Let's see.
[21:54.69]Mission stories.
[21:56.27]Eyes on the target.
[21:57.53]Over the top.
[21:58.57]Or the tour.
[21:59.47]I want to do the tour.
[22:01.91]The guy they were talking about is over here.
[22:08.95]Turn down the music.
[22:19.86]Turn it up.
[22:26.97]Wait, wine bottle.
[22:28.27]Let me get the wine bottle.
[22:32.23]It's not illegal, right?
[22:33.75]Oh my god, I can bottle somebody.
[22:39.48]...from the boss.
[22:40.91]Duty calls.
[22:41.83]Let me guess, the Burnwood woman.
[22:43.53]That's right.
[22:44.63]Gates has arranged for the chief winemaker to take Burnwood and Tamara Vidal on a grand tour of the estate.
[22:49.96]Me?
[22:50.02]That's like me but British.
[22:50.72]Alright, go sign in.
[22:52.53]AKA get bottled in the bathroom and then get your costume taken.
[23:11.32]A private tour of the estate.
[23:13.71]Diana, Vidal, and this fixer, Corvo Black.
[23:17.99]Black is a threat, but also an opportunity.
[23:22.11]Yates' own machinations are inconsequential.
[23:25.84]Joining the tour will give access to Vidal.
[23:28.60]The whole time I'm staring at them.
[23:32.72]Oh, we can't get him to say that again.
[23:34.26]We can't get him to say that again.
[23:37.41]Too bad.
[23:42.76]Disguise yourself as Corvo Black.
[23:56.09]Here we go.
[23:57.37]Remember, this is a gamer save.
[24:03.43]You aren't telling me what I'm...
[24:08.73]Don't kill anybody.
[24:09.47]That's important.
[24:10.01]Kill them all.
[24:10.75]Kill them.
[24:11.03]No.
[24:11.21]Why does this chat suck so much?
[24:34.27]Didn't say it, you did.
[24:35.29]I didn't say that.
[24:36.11]Oh, QR code.
[24:36.38]Scan it with my camera.
[24:37.14]What is that?
[24:37.96]Cool.
[24:57.56]Nieto Yates features a spectacular dining patio on top of their winemaking facility.
[25:02.76]Cool.
[25:06.71]We hate one guy.
[25:07.65]This is rude.
[25:17.84]What's rude?
[25:19.64]This is a terrible link.
[25:20.68]I keep seeing terrible link.
[25:29.93]I need to get, okay, this guy's about to be alone.
[25:32.47]Okay, this is important.
[25:33.59]I don't want to fuck this up.
[25:35.83]He's coming over here.
[25:37.63]He is alone.
[25:39.05]He's alone.
[25:41.66]Diana, Diana, just like scream really loud right now.
[25:46.24]And when everyone runs over, be like, oh, I'm sorry.
[25:48.62]There was a bug on my face.
[25:50.69]Give me a hand here.
[26:04.53]I couldn't do it.
[26:05.01]I couldn't do it.
[26:05.60]I couldn't do it.
[26:06.22]I couldn't do it.
[26:06.80]I couldn't do it.
[26:07.28]I couldn't do it.
[26:07.76]I didn't save scum.
[26:09.02]That's not a save scum.
[26:10.26]That was me predicting that I couldn't do it.
[26:11.80]I couldn't do it.
[26:20.14]Fuck!
[26:20.52]Why is he mad at me?
[26:35.38]Fuck, I can't do it.
[26:36.40]There's another opportunity right here.
[26:38.36]If he turns around, I have to kill him.
[26:39.98]Fuck!
[26:40.16]I can't kill that guy.
[27:09.99]What?
[27:10.95]Ah!
[27:31.11]I can't do it.
[27:31.59]I can't do it.
[27:31.95]It's impossible.
[27:32.59]I can't play Hitman like this.
[27:34.17]It's impossible.
[27:35.07]It's literally impossible.
[27:36.47]It's literally impossible.
[27:38.11]It's impossible to play a game like this.
[27:39.33]It's impossible.
[27:39.91]I lose.
[27:40.37]Cancel the deal.
[27:46.45]Cancel it.
[27:48.89]Cancel the deal.
[27:49.59]Cancel the deal.
[27:50.15]I can't do it.
[27:51.59]Cancel the deal.
[27:52.43]Cancel it.
[27:54.39]Cancel the deal right now.
[27:55.43]It's not going to happen.
[27:56.41]I guarantee it won't happen.
[27:59.13]The deal is off.
[28:06.70]This is not going to fucking happen.
[28:10.40]Load the save.
[28:11.44]I can't save scum.
[28:12.46]And right there I would have had to kill like four people.
[28:18.02]Add a dollar to the debt.
[28:21.19]He's dead.
[28:23.73]Okay.
[28:24.01]Well, you know what?
[28:24.75]That's fine.
[28:25.09]That's minus 50,000 points.
[28:25.91]I don't even care.
[28:32.93]The deal is off.
[28:35.15]You know what?
[28:35.53]How about this?
[28:37.51]You can add $50,000 for every minute that we had that deal going before I canceled it.
[29:01.73]Why?
[29:01.97]That's not that much.
[29:03.57]That's like $2,000,000.
[29:05.67]How much is that?
[29:10.64]It's 1.5 million.
[29:21.84]I said 50,000 for every minute.
[29:23.26]It's been like two minutes, 12 minutes.
[29:27.16]What's this guy?
[29:27.62]What happened to this guy?
[29:28.48]Why are you puking?
[29:32.20]Why did I do that?
[29:44.07]Who's searching?
[29:48.57]Okay, we're gonna go up.
[29:54.70]It's good.
[29:54.92]Let's take the tour.
[29:56.28]That guy tripped.
[30:01.56]Actual maniac.
[30:12.15]Again, I will say it again for all the people that were not here a few days ago.
[30:19.01]Playing GTA 5, but following all the rules and the traffic signals is how Hitman is supposed to be played.
[30:26.12]I can't do that.
[30:28.74]Corvo Black.
[30:30.26]I'm on the tour.
[30:31.41]Right.
[30:32.11]Mr. Black.
[30:34.05]Welcome.
[30:35.19]Miss Burnwood and Miss Vidal will meet you down by the wine fields.
[30:39.43]I trust you know the way.
[30:40.63]If I'm driving the car in GTA, and there's just like... I'm just going to get out of the car and I'm going to punch someone.
[30:45.89]And then I'm going to get back in the car and go back to normal and do the mission.
[30:54.32]Body... He's naked.
[30:56.64]Yeah.
[30:57.10]Hey.
[31:01.77]Let's go start the tour.
[31:02.63]Stream is actually not ironically fucked.
[31:09.37]Ooh, this is beautiful.
[31:09.89]How was my day?
[31:10.51]It was pretty good.
[31:11.75]How was yours?
[31:32.86]Your 1080 is dying.
[31:33.28]Don't worry.
[31:33.71]I'm getting a new computer.
[31:34.73]It's just this shit's hard to get right now.
[31:36.65]Sorry, that like fucked with me in real life.
[31:39.27]Alright, here we go.
[31:40.45]Let's join the other guests.
[31:41.05]Here comes the tour.
[32:05.71]Here.
[32:06.29]You two must be Burnward and Vidal.
[32:09.16]And you must be Yates' garbage man.
[32:11.66]Sorry, but I didn't catch your name.
[32:16.96]This is Corvo Black, Tamara.
[32:19.02]He's a... I see a regular.
[32:21.55]I only work with the best.
[32:23.23]Well,
[32:23.90]Where is he?
[32:24.34]Infiltrate the grape fields?
[32:25.92]Infiltrate the grape fields.
[32:27.02]Why not just say go get the guy?
[32:28.64]Infiltrate the grape fields.
[32:29.44]Okay.
[32:56.70]We're supposed to be on the tour.
[33:00.74]What the fuck is this?
[33:07.66]Oh dear, okay.
[33:15.62]Oh my god!
[33:16.50]Alright, I'm fine.
[33:20.69]I got a coin here.
[33:26.21]No, don't look over here.
[33:27.09]Look over there.
[33:36.69]Into the barrel?
[33:38.05]Okay.
[33:38.57]Hang out right here.
[33:40.95]Puncture.
[33:41.83]Doi, doi, doi.
[33:42.91]Doi, doi, doi, doi, doi, doi, doi.
[33:52.70]Remember?
[33:53.40]If I don't have more important things to do than babysit Yates, socialize friends.
[33:57.36]I'm like a bird.
[33:58.50]You just do certain calls, I'll call back.
[34:00.27]Better do what he says, Patron.
[34:01.85]Big shot do your lawyer like that.
[34:03.89]Don't want to get on his bad side.
[34:05.79]Well, I'm not going anywhere until I have decided if the coffee is right for picking.
[34:09.35]Bring me the three Malbec grapes.
[34:11.48]Three Malbec.
[34:12.92]I love Malbec.
[34:15.16]Three grapes.
[34:15.56]Excuse me?
[34:48.97]Excuse me?
[34:51.05]Dave's come.
[34:51.67]The deal's off.
[34:52.24]That doesn't matter.
[34:52.80]There's no way I was going to do that.
[34:53.88]You knew that was not going to happen.
[34:56.46]It just wasn't.
[34:57.34]That was not possibly going to happen.
[35:09.74]Wait, what?
[35:13.79]Why is he not investigating?
[35:16.87]Richard, Ramon, just break.
[35:19.37]That knife is coming out of your salary.
[35:21.92]Ah, Jesus Christ.
[35:44.88]Is it a wood chipper?
[35:46.64]What is that?
[35:47.50]I'm not going to grind this guy's body up, right?
[35:50.04]What?
[35:50.20]You what?
[35:50.88]What?
[35:51.14]Why?
[35:51.50]You can what?
[36:01.73]It's disguised!
[36:43.57]I'm just going to do the same exact thing I did last time.
[36:49.39]You guys, walk by.
[36:55.78]Ready?
[36:56.00]Check this out.
[36:57.24]Two guards walk by.
[36:58.26]I can't believe I ground that guy up.
[37:01.44]Where are the two guards?
[37:03.50]There they are.
[37:03.90]Oh.
[37:31.13]I thought if I went the other way it'd be safer.
[37:48.72]Read the objective.
[37:49.46]Discard yourself as a winery worker.
[37:53.83]Not the winery worker.
[37:56.79]A winery worker.
[37:58.63]A winery worker.
[38:05.58]Not this winery worker.
[38:07.94]Not that winery worker.
[38:10.02]A winery... Well, it doesn't matter.
[38:12.59]He's the one with the fucking blue thing on it.
[38:13.97]I'm taking him.
[38:37.81]Acquire a grape picking knife.
[38:39.37]Shred him.
[38:41.73]No!
[38:45.99]I'm not gonna shred this guy.
[38:47.56]That's so much money.
[38:50.84]That's so much money from Freddy Dredd.
[38:55.70]Freddy Dredd giving just millions of community subs at this point.
[39:00.89]Or thousands.
[39:02.29]Thanks, Freddy.
[39:02.65]That's 69 community subs.
[39:03.95]Holy
[39:08.70]Alright, I need a knife.
[39:09.62]Thank you.
[39:10.65]People have given a shitload of money.
[39:11.99]I... Thanks, guys.
[39:15.69]I don't even know what to do.
[39:16.77]I don't even know what to say.
[39:17.63]This is so much money.
[39:18.63]Does he give somebody?
[39:20.64]You guys... A bunch of you.
[39:25.10]Our benefactors.. Alright, I need a grape-picking knife.
[39:35.80]Oh, this guy.
[39:36.16]These guys can see through my disguise.
[39:38.38]Holy shit.
[39:38.84]I just accidentally did this correctly.
[39:47.29]Harvest three ripe Malbec grapevines.
[39:54.41]Oh my god.
[39:54.67]Is he crying?
[39:55.71]What?
[40:05.08]Yes.
[40:07.36]Orders confirmed.
[40:08.04]I will.
[40:17.10]Just like the blue.
[40:18.34]Okay, harvest three Malbec Grapes.
[40:34.23]Are these Malbec Grapes?
[40:40.38]No?
[40:41.14]Oh, they are.
[40:41.52]Okay.
[40:43.18]These are big.
[40:46.48]Harvest two ripe Malbec grapes.
[40:53.34]Why would I have to sneak around doing this?
[40:54.60]I think I have to distract this guy.
[41:08.56]Here's the mission, Agent 985.
[41:10.11]No?
[41:10.63]Yeah, Soto.
[41:23.01]Why don't you just open this thing up and pick some grapes out of here?
[41:25.53]I need... There.
[41:32.22]Is that one right there?
[41:33.40]Alright, this one.
[41:34.20]They look like beehives.
[41:35.80]Alright, here we go.
[41:36.28]Ready?
[41:36.44]Ready?
[41:38.27]What was that over there?
[41:38.87]Excuse me?
[41:42.81]Hey, you break it, you buy it.
[41:49.15]Oh, easy, easy, easy.
[41:49.91]I don't know what to turn that on.
[41:52.00]There's one this way.
[41:59.48]Investigating distraction.
[42:00.48]Good.
[42:00.70]There's one right here.
[42:03.82]Wait, is anybody looking this way?
[42:05.12]Nope.
[42:05.44]Okay.
[42:05.70]What about this way?
[42:07.06]Nope.
[42:07.36]Go.
[42:09.61]Last one.
[42:10.05]Thank you.
[42:15.17]Deliver the grapes to the chef.
[42:17.37]Sure thing.
[42:23.18]It hurt.
[42:23.48]I don't know why.
[42:27.36]The grape chef.
[42:28.84]We're going to give it to the grape chef.
[42:39.15]This is why I don't do facecam.
[42:41.01]Because I end up going like this.
[43:03.92]You know what they need to make?
[43:05.12]They need to make a device that you put around your neck so you can't move your neck forward.
[43:13.37]Would you guys get one of those?
[43:14.19]If it was, like, a posture neck thing that, like, it was, like, a thing around your neck and there was, like, a thing here that, like, went... I know you saw my fucking armpit hair and it's too long.
[43:22.24]Oh, hey, his armpit hair is way too long.
[43:24.78]Does he do any manscaping?
[43:26.58]All the time, but not recently because I've been busy.
[43:29.56]So, anyways.
[43:30.94]I've got a thing around the neck that connects to the back of the chair, so it's like... Because I always go like this and I'm always like...
[43:44.61]That's just, alright, that's... That's just a chain.
[43:50.27]No, I don't want that.
[43:53.89]The gamer posture.
[43:56.68]The gamer posture corrector is just like a fucking like neck brace that holds like a chain.
[44:13.06]If you would get so excited or like a big kill or something.
[44:15.80]If you're sitting there like playing like fucking Fortnite, just like.
[44:18.25]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[44:20.83]One more.
[44:21.27]Build, build, build, build, build.
[44:22.17]Come on, come on.
[44:23.91]Yeah.
[44:25.47]Oh, right, right.
[44:26.53]Okay.
[44:27.89]Oh, victory royale.
[44:29.81]I did it.
[44:36.26]Wait, so I gotta save it.
[44:41.82]Game leash.
[44:43.05]I have the three grapes you requested.
[44:44.97]I have to hand it to him?
[44:45.95]Fine.
[44:46.53]Are we gonna try it?
[44:48.67]Is he just gonna squish it in his hands like into this cup and I'm gonna try it?
[44:57.31]That's a 10.
[45:13.42]That's a tent.
[45:15.30]What if you had to go to the bathroom?
[45:22.08]Do you have like the key right here?
[45:27.34]Disguise yourself as Corvo Black.
[45:36.57]I have the keys and there's just the key to this thing sitting here.
[45:39.33]What if I drop it on the ground?
[45:41.64]if it's just like okay that was awesome I got two victory royals in a row let me just get that key oh oh no let me just get my phone my phone really oh boy that's the phone on the ground
[46:19.86]I don't want to start screaming in that.
[46:26.42]Well, why don't I have access to my hands?
[46:29.26]Why am I, like, strapped to the chair?
[46:33.32]So not only do I have, like, the gamer, uh, like, nerd neck preventer, I also apparently have my arms taped to the chair.
[46:42.60]I don't know why that's, why can't, why am I, like, reaching like this to try to get the phone?
[46:54.77]Are you going to see me do this?
[46:58.46]Just in case somebody does, I'm saving it right here.
[47:06.85]Okay, good.
[47:08.07]I'm now trespassing?
[47:09.09]Oh, right, because I'm a different person.
[47:10.15]Top the fence.
[47:21.60]Oh my god, Jerma.
[47:22.20]Look what Nieners is playing.
[47:23.40]Oh yeah, I saw.
[47:24.62]PowerWash Simulator.
[47:27.12]I wonder if it's the game of the year.
[47:28.34]I'm just kicking this thing all over the place.
[47:40.35]Alright, let's save it here.
[47:40.99]I feel like I'm going to have a lot of opportunity just being stupid.
[47:44.33]This is not even a guy I have to kill.
[47:47.90]This is not even the target.
[47:48.58]Every time I hear Diana talk, I just think she's not here.
[47:51.96]I just hear like she's in that fear piece.
[48:06.78]So, how do you like Argentina?
[48:08.97]Like everywhere else.
[48:10.45]Full of Americans.
[48:12.50]The production floor.
[48:13.68]Is this how, is this how it actually works?
[48:16.07]They, did they bring the, I thought, I thought they just like froze them.
[48:39.20]I can't pretend with that one.
[48:44.25]I know how wine is made.
[48:46.27]I can't make a fucking stupid bit how I don't know what they do.
[48:49.67]I know what they do.
[48:50.20]They crush them.
[48:50.84]And they squish them.
[48:53.56]I can't pretend like, oh, they freeze them and then they put them in like the squisher.
[48:58.44]I'm not going to even go down that road today.
[49:00.70]Farming like a question mark.
[49:01.68]Oh, cool.
[49:02.10]The McDonald's play place part.
[49:04.02]I love this.
[49:04.72]Hold on.
[49:21.68]Ask questions, okay.
[49:23.23]Yes, um...
[49:47.96]Are we allowed to taste the grapes during the production process?
[49:52.68]Wait.
[50:08.19]What can you tell me about this device?
[50:11.47]Great presser, was it?
[50:13.39]Wait, is it a squisher?
[50:15.31]Primary fermentation, the mass is pressed through a fine filter, leaving only the flesh and skins behind.
[50:21.16]I should add, the grape stomping, the iconic practice of crushing grapes with your bare feet, is historically read and mostly a tourist gimmick.
[50:29.12]You are most welcome to try.
[50:32.55]Imagine you're a grape.
[50:34.11]Ha ha ha ha.
[50:36.56]Press it.
[50:37.76]Press the button right now.
[50:39.52]Let's see if I can Indiana Jones get out of this in time.
[50:42.21]Okay, cool.
[50:49.19]Wait, what do you... Unlock?
[50:51.64]Safety mechanism.
[50:57.18]Wait, I can squish them?
[51:03.14]Who has a key?
[51:03.54]Save, save, save.
[51:04.44]Oh, I think he's just... I need a key.
[51:05.70]Okay.
[51:33.26]No!
[51:33.42]Somebody pressed the button and squished her!
[51:49.93]You have a lockpick.
[51:56.47]It's grayed out.
[52:01.04]Who has the key?
[52:02.94]Does one of these guys have a key?
[52:09.52]I can't believe you would stand in this for more than one second.
[52:11.72]I would never even stand in it.
[52:13.60]Oh, take a picture?
[52:15.26]The thing that is designed to only fucking squish and crush things?
[52:20.49]You're gonna stand underneath that for a fucking tourist photo?
[52:25.81]What are you talking about?
[52:33.00]Wait, hold on.
[52:33.50]We gotta go up here.
[52:39.92]Put the lockpick in your hand.
[52:44.74]Wait, I have a keyhacker.
[52:46.70]Does that do anything?
[52:50.53]Somebody said Willy Wonka joke incoming.
[52:52.95]Did you just spoil a potential joke that I was gonna make?
[52:55.97]And I didn't even know I was gonna make it until right now?
[53:01.55]What the fuck, man?
[53:03.26]Oh, come on.
[53:03.76]Unbelievable.
[53:04.32]Unbelievable.
[53:04.72]Augustus, you're getting too close.
[53:08.34]I love chocolate.
[53:08.94]I was going to do that.
[53:09.94]That was a wrong person.
[53:34.95]That was Diana.
[53:45.69]Why did you ruin that for me?
[53:47.91]You ruined that for me.
[53:51.27]I didn't know that's what this was.
[53:52.65]And I was about to... I could have done like an Augustus bit.
[53:55.59]Where I dumped Augustus in there.
[53:57.77]Well, not dumped.
[53:58.45]I don't.
[53:58.87]But like pretend... Like Augustus gets stuck in the pipe.
[54:02.97]The cooling system allows us to fine-tune the entire process.
[54:07.29]Temperature, temperature levels, etc.
[54:10.23]Our goal here at Pineda Yates is quite simple.
[54:13.15]Don't do it, Diana.
[54:14.76]Diana, don't do it.
[54:18.66]Handpicked with loving care by local experts, we have only one purpose.
[54:23.48]To make the best Venus in Argentina and beyond.
[54:27.60]Well...
[54:28.80]Almost.
[54:29.10]That was very close.
[54:29.96]Standing on it with high heels.
[54:31.52]Yeah.
[55:03.75]I can't dump her in here?
[55:07.57]Okay, but wait.
[55:17.02]What happens when she doesn't come back to the door?
[55:23.04]Kathy had diarrhea.
[55:24.17]She had to leave.
[55:31.33]There's a third option.
[56:16.17]I'm just gonna say it.
[56:16.73]That's what all of us are thinking.
[56:19.65]If this was on Steam, this wouldn't happen.
[56:25.47]Because it didn't.
[56:43.39]It did happen.
[56:45.54]This is on the fucking Nintendo store, this wouldn't happen.
[57:02.29]I didn't just pick my nose, I went like this.
[57:08.01]That's the worst one.
[57:11.55]Okay, error.
[57:12.89]Unable to load requested menu.
[57:18.70]Okay, I'm going to... Here's another thing all of us are thinking.
[57:22.13]Unable to load the request menu.
[57:23.31]Please retry the request or contact Hitman support if this is a problem.
[57:27.49]How many people are looking at those emails coming in?
[57:32.27]Contact Hitman support about how I lost connection.
[57:38.43]There's an inbox somewhere with like 40,000 unread emails saying, hey, I servered it and it didn't work.
[58:05.77]Call them.
[58:06.69]It's not a number, it's like a support email.
[58:17.65]Can I not even load the game now?
[58:18.73]What the heck?
[58:25.32]What the heck?
[58:29.70]That bar is loading.
[58:31.20]You can't see it, but it's going very slow.
[58:38.25]Somebody said, the game stinks.
[58:42.67]I'm just gonna hard reset.
[58:43.53]I hope I don't lose save.
[58:46.67]Do a hard, a hard destroy.
[58:48.68]Okay.
[59:03.16]Good thing it cloud synced the game files.
[59:18.58]What mod should you get for Oblivion?
[59:24.20]Are you... nevermind.
[59:41.71]I am required to play online, but you are not required to make sure it works.
[59:51.55]Yes.
[59:59.00]Let's go.
[60:15.37]Don't do it again.
[60:17.49]Don't do it again.
[60:18.09]I'm going to be very upset if it does it again.
[60:20.45]Thank God.
[60:21.17]Alright.
[60:21.69]So... There's another... There's a third option.
[60:24.94]I want to see it.
[60:26.08]When is the comedy part of the stream?
[60:27.88]Well... Stay tuned.
[60:42.63]Stay tuned when we do the next, like, mouse trap.
[60:46.33]I'm going to push him in.
[60:47.43]I have this.
[60:48.23]Alright.
[60:48.85]I want to see the last one.
[61:11.96]It was the third one.
[61:20.08]Where's this last one?
[61:26.43]How would he hear me from all the way over here?
[61:29.77]We've never heard 47 raise his voice.
[61:37.21]Has he ever screamed?
[61:41.49]I mean, alright.
[61:42.29]Come on.
[61:42.59]Like, give me a break.
[61:43.41]Really?
[61:45.07]What can you tell me about this grape crusher?
[61:47.75]Like... What can you tell me about the grape crusher?
[61:55.42]Well... It crushes things.
[61:57.68]Hold on.
[61:58.02]Does it kind of crush anything?
[62:01.00]Okay.
[62:18.39]Well as the name implies it crushes the steam grapes wrench in You're gonna see me do this though Have you had any workplace accidents?
[62:32.50]For into the back and get crushed to a pile it had to be a bonafide a idiot Waste of space
[62:40.57]yes well fortunately we have had none of that so if there's no further questions he's gonna put on some music what about that guy oh my god oh that's disgusting
[63:10.13]What happened?
[63:16.03]Hey, what happened to the calling?
[63:20.24]Looks like a little deep red, a little deeper than usual.
[63:26.68]You know what's the funniest part about that?
[63:28.36]I throw in a wrench, everybody screams.
[63:30.38]I throw a person in there who screams.
[63:33.03]And makes way more noise.
[63:34.33]Nobody gives a shit.
[63:35.99]You might say we run in the same circles.
[63:38.47]Show an order.
[63:39.85]Must be very exciting.
[63:41.95]Have to be a bonafide idiot.
[63:46.67]That was fucking awesome.
[63:50.90]Remember, this is fucked up.
[63:52.54]It's a hitman.
[63:53.58]You kill people and you grind them up and you throw them off the ocean and shit.
[63:57.50]Are you enjoying yourself, mister?
[64:00.78]This is not Yoshi's Wooly World.
[64:02.90]This is Hitman.
[64:03.82]You grind people up into like a meat grinder.
[64:06.42]Oh, I just tried to close the door on him.
[64:25.74]Well, this motherfucker's right here.
[64:28.14]Can I, like, throw that guy in the meat grinder?
[64:30.24]Is he in the barrel?
[64:31.76]To make sure the wine is good, he stays in there?
[64:34.90]He is what makes it so delicious?
[64:56.80]The secure wine fridge next to the barrel room contains the vineyard's most precious wines.
[65:01.25]But the access doors, which are made from ballistic glass, can only be unlocked from a terminal in the upstairs security room.
[65:08.69]Ah, here comes Senor Yates.
[65:10.53]Oh, it's not a real barrel.
[65:11.55]I shall leave you in his capable hands.
[65:13.75]How reassuring.
[65:15.33]Ah, Miss Burnwood, is it not?
[65:17.60]Don Yates.
[65:18.60]Pleased to meet you.
[65:19.88]You come very highly recommended.
[65:22.34]As chief of the heralds, let me be the first to say welcome aboard.
[65:26.03]Thank you.
[65:26.37]We are.
[65:26.53]I believe.
[65:26.73]Take the black.
[65:52.62]I wouldn't miss it for the world.
[65:54.04]Capital.
[65:54.75]Right this way.
[65:56.15]Into the lion's den.
[65:59.28]Why don't you take a break, Corvo?
[66:01.34]We're done here for now, I think.
[66:03.93]Oh, but don't go too far.
[66:05.61]I may still need your services later.
[66:07.45]I'll be closer than you think.
[66:09.51]Oh, almost forgot.
[66:11.43]What is it?
[66:12.13]Please nip down to the wine cellar and tell Mr. Flowers, the sommelier, to prep the 1945 Grand Paladin and bring it up to the house.
[66:20.38]That's code.
[66:22.48]1945 Grand Paladin.
[66:23.48]That's like a bazooka.
[66:25.66]Make sure to get the bazooka ready to fire it when they start to come into the front door.
[66:36.83]What's going on Intel?
[66:45.41]There it is.
[66:45.91]Okay.
[66:47.16]Intel.
[67:03.64]Oh.
[67:14.05]Have the ghosts of Jesus, John Lennon, and Eva Peron unexpectedly come for dinner?
[67:21.04]Out here, what could possibly be so special?
[67:24.94]Above your clearance, Flowers.
[67:26.63]Just fetch it already.
[67:27.89]Fine.
[67:29.15]What's the passcode again?
[67:31.05]Last year of World War II.
[67:32.41]If you have to look it up, shame on you.
[67:39.64]Last year of 1945?
[67:41.54]1946?
[67:42.92]Yates has invited the Heralds to a small gathering in his wine cellar.
[67:52.59]A celebration of his upcoming inauguration as the new Constant.
[67:55.85]Likely, Yates wants to make a good impression with his future team.
[67:59.41]But he hadn't expected the team to include Diana Burnwood.
[68:02.43]That's me.
[68:15.92]Disguise yourself as a sommelier.
[68:26.10]How do I get in there?
[68:30.48]Wait, security camera.
[68:31.54]Can I take a photo of it?
[68:36.20]Can I open this somehow?
[68:41.28]Shoot the glass.
[68:42.09]I'm not gonna shoot the fucking glass.
[68:55.46]Punch the glass.
[69:00.80]Can I go in here?
[69:03.82]Turn the tap.
[69:11.67]Tap on the glass.
[69:12.63]No, that's not going to work.
[69:20.76]Can I do something with this?
[69:21.94]Can I open it like this?
[69:23.58]No.
[69:26.45]Nothing I can do about this.
[69:27.69]Is there a place I can go?
[69:30.29]Maybe I should just like... Hold on.
[69:31.75]Maybe I should just tap on the glass.
[69:36.47]What's the worst that could happen?
[69:37.39]I like drop a bottle and they come and say what's wrong?
[69:40.91]I'm gonna tap on the glass.
[69:46.12]That's a... That's a bomb!
[69:52.05]I thought that was a coin I thought it was a coin Oops Let me take a piss, I'll be right back
[73:03.95]Goku?
[73:05.41]Well, let me ask you a question, Goku.
[73:08.07]I can't do it.
[73:08.45]I just ate food.
[73:09.01]I can't.
[73:09.79]Hold on.
[73:11.93]Well, I can't believe it, Goku.
[73:15.74]No, I just had a piece of beef jerky, so it's kind of still going down.
[73:19.66]I can't do it.
[73:20.08]I need full, empty throat to be able to do that.
[73:27.38]I kind of sound like a little different.
[73:29.02]It's because I had two beef jerky sticks and they're still going down.
[73:33.94]I need full, complete, empty pathway.
[73:38.44]Why am I crying?
[73:43.11]Reality.
[73:43.65]Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry.
[73:58.24]Cry, cry, cry.
[73:59.14]Should I just, like, cry on stream with, like, a full cam and just wait for somebody to be like, what's going on?
[74:13.94]Just get, like, water droplets, like, to wet my fingers and, like, make sure, like, tears are coming down and just sit there and be going... Sure.
[74:29.17]That's kind of fucked up.
[74:30.05]I don't want to do that.
[74:31.77]What happened?
[74:38.58]Oh, okay.
[74:39.10]17.09.
[74:46.07]Shave your head.
[74:47.37]No, I have it for now and it's staying here until it's gone.
[74:51.55]Alright, I don't want to be on camera.
[74:53.67]Hold on, let me do the thing where I sit down at a computer and I go like this.
[75:00.87]Okay, I have really, like, watery eyes.
[75:02.95]Just in general.
[75:04.65]So, if you notice, I go like this a lot.
[75:07.03]And, like, so if I get, like, shot from this direction, and I'm, like, kind of doing hard blinks with my eyes because they're watery, like, that's why I didn't see that guy.
[75:14.67]A lot of people, when you go like, oh, how did you not see that?
[75:17.20]I probably went like this.
[75:17.94]I was probably looking this way, and I went... And somebody shot up right there.
[75:21.18]Right there.
[75:21.94]And I didn't see them.
[75:22.62]And they disappeared.
[75:24.48]I have really watery eyes.
[75:28.62]I just have very...
[75:31.37]I need to go upstairs.
[75:39.82]What's this?
[75:44.34]I'm not trespassing.
[75:45.14]I'm allowed to be here.
[75:48.36]Anything in this room I can... Oh, wait.
[75:49.32]There's poison.
[75:55.60]Winery workers key.
[75:56.78]Oh shit, nice.
[75:57.54]And a tier one access dongle?
[76:00.88]They're just sitting out here.
[76:02.24]A key to unlock doors and machinery on the winery production floor.
[76:04.59]Cool.
[76:04.73]BLT sandwich.
[76:05.23]Thanks.
[76:20.62]What did he just do?
[76:23.58]Poison that?
[76:24.58]I guess I could disguise as one of these guys.
[76:27.82]Hmm.
[76:31.56]Use cell.
[76:38.10]Hmm.
[76:38.96]Should I disguise as one of them?
[76:44.60]Maybe I'll need the outfit.
[76:56.73]I don't like your face, pendejo.
[76:59.55]I just added some sugar.
[77:00.35]Now listen to me.
[77:03.49]I'm warning you.
[77:10.58]I gotta distract him.
[77:16.70]I could go for some mate right now.
[77:23.39]When he said that.
[77:26.21]Heh.
[77:31.05]Ate?
[77:34.29]Ate.
[77:39.63]Okay.
[77:41.41]Uh, let's distract.
[77:43.07]Let's distract them both.
[77:49.62]What?
[77:49.98]I'm just looking back here.
[77:51.22]I'm alright.
[77:53.76]I appreciate your concern.
[77:59.30]You mess up your spine?
[78:07.38]Gamer neck.
[78:16.23]I'm alright.
[78:20.73]I'm not sure I know who you are.
[78:22.79]Oh, you don't like that either.
[78:44.78]I mean, I'm trying to pause it at the... I'm trying to... I'm doing that every time.
[78:47.98]And I thought it might get old at this point.
[78:52.00]But it hasn't.
[78:52.92]I don't... You know what I mean?
[78:53.66]It still is, like, funny to me.
[78:55.00]I mean, I could do... This is just... This is tried and true.
[79:07.51]Here's the tried... Wait, I have grapes.
[79:12.27]Yeah, this is tried and true.
[79:13.47]I'm gonna go with tried and true.
[79:16.02]This is how I play.
[79:17.66]I throw something to cause a distraction.
[79:21.90]And then they both turn around.
[79:22.78]They both go over there.
[79:23.50]And then I'm going to poison.
[79:24.26]Thank you.
[79:53.52]It's a pretty cool, like, Halloween drink.
[79:56.84]In fact, I'm 95% certain that that was in the Doctor Dreadful commercial.
[80:05.81]Have bubbling, disgusting brews.
[80:10.01]Yeah.
[80:12.37]And I drank it.
[80:15.66]You can even eat brains in my Doctor Dreadful kid science kit.
[80:24.62]You know, I wanted to do Dr. Dreadful on stream.
[80:27.22]But holy shit, it's rare as absolute fuck.
[80:30.92]They don't make that shit really anymore and it's hard to find.
[80:37.15]Wait, get him now.
[80:37.95]Get him right now.
[80:38.45]Get him now.
[80:39.37]No, I wanted to choke him.
[80:40.63]I wanted to choke him.
[80:42.00]I wanted to choke him.
[80:42.54]Did anybody hear that?
[80:45.14]No, good.
[80:59.63]Where can I put him when no one's gonna see him?
[81:04.82]Oh, shit.
[81:05.26]Nice.
[81:05.46]Okay.
[81:05.68]Alright, where can I put him that no one will see him?
[81:09.24]There's a guy right here.
[81:10.06]Oh, come on.
[81:11.72]Just... Grind this guy.
[81:17.62]You tell me, you want me to drag this guy all the way to the grape crusher and crush him?
[81:30.16]It's gonna be on camera
[82:11.04]Who is shooting?
[82:41.29]I need to be quiet.
[82:42.25]I need to do it tactically.
[82:43.65]God damn it.
[82:44.65]Fine.
[82:45.27]I'll do it fucking tactically.
[82:46.95]Just kill a guy near the grinder.
[82:56.86]Let me try this one more time.
[83:01.84]Isn't the grinder really far away?
[83:03.24]The grinder is not close.
[83:09.36]It's very far away.
[83:15.58]It's over there.
[83:18.20]Hold on.
[83:19.76]You still... It's the fucking video camera.
[83:22.92]Oh, it's this guy.
[83:23.84]Whatever.
[83:27.36]Who is looking at this?
[83:42.45]You're ignoring the link.
[83:43.85]Yeah.
[83:44.97]I am.
[83:53.54]I am ignoring the link.
[83:55.58]You're right.
[83:57.55]And I'm going to continue to do so.
[84:04.13]Third time's the charm.
[84:06.23]If I don't get it this time, I'm just going to move on.
[84:10.04]I have to distract everybody somehow.
[84:14.48]Come on out here.
[84:21.22]Okay.
[84:22.54]I have my special save point right here.
[84:24.02]Put him down.
[84:29.18]Give me a coin.
[84:29.78]Alright, that's like a fuse cell.
[84:32.68]Let me like throw it or something.
[84:33.86]I have like a bottle.
[84:34.72]Let's throw the bottle over here.
[84:35.88]He's dead.
[84:43.73]I got him.
[84:53.53]I got him!
[84:57.51]Just pretend I ground him up in the grape grinder.
[85:03.50]Does Jerma look down at his keys?
[85:04.86]It's killing me.
[85:09.67]Yes!
[85:26.23]Just grind up everybody.
[85:27.27]I think I want to do like a crazy guy run.
[85:29.45]Where everybody gets put in the meat grinder.
[85:32.67]I have a save over there, right?
[85:33.97]Alright, I do.
[85:36.59]Not right now.
[85:38.47]But eventually.
[85:40.41]When I finish this mission, I want to go back to that save file.
[85:43.34]And I want to just put like 50 people into the grinder.
[85:46.80]I want to put the entire mission into the grinder.
[85:49.32]I want to put every enemy into the meat grinder.
[85:52.64]Well, that's going to take a long time.
[85:58.18]Alright, I need to go down this way to disguise as the sommelier.
[86:16.87]And links.
[86:19.35]Hmm.
[86:21.81]Maybe.
[86:23.23]Disable the security.
[86:24.96]Enable alarm.
[86:25.60]Temperature controls.
[86:26.42]Ventilate.
[86:27.04]Alright, disable security doors.
[86:37.69]Go down, down, down, down, down.
[86:38.69]Go down, down, down, down.
[86:39.45]Hurry.
[86:39.65]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[86:56.56]I'm trespassing.
[86:58.77]I'm a security guard.
[87:02.95]You look pretty good for 53.
[87:03.81]That's how old my dad is.
[87:05.37]Thanks.
[87:06.87]I'm gonna need these.
[87:07.57]Why do I feel like these are paints?
[87:38.96]Viendo Yates Pinot Noir, inspired by wines from the Ar Valley, medium-bodied and fruit-forward with an aroma of cherries and raspberry.
[87:47.04]Not their most popular.
[87:49.19]This one's not good.
[87:49.93]I don't... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[87:55.47]You don't throw the mouth back.
[87:59.97]Throw the Pinot out of here.
[88:07.39]Hold on to the Malbec.
[88:08.19]Go!
[88:37.32]Now disable the lasers.
[88:38.68]Can I hide this guy somewhere?
[88:45.05]Oh, shit.
[88:45.45]They're coming back.
[88:56.99]I thought this disguise has water.
[89:03.90]Alright.
[89:04.60]With 1945? 1946?
[89:13.51]1945.
[89:13.55]I can't even read this.
[89:16.78]Here it is.
[89:20.64]Yep.
[89:23.98]Wait, this is like the... This is the super bottle.
[89:32.93]Alright, put them both in here.
[89:34.37]Right?
[89:36.39]Where can I hide these guys?
[89:37.33]I don't think anybody comes in here.
[89:56.19]I need that.
[89:56.67]I need that.
[90:03.78]Drop the shotgun.
[90:04.98]The sommelier has a shotgun.
[90:06.44]Does it matter if the sommelier has a shotgun?
[90:14.49]Does it?
[90:14.87]Fine.
[90:21.75]What else is illegal?
[90:22.81]Fine.
[90:24.30]What else is illegal?
[90:26.45]I mean, this is illegal, but whatever.
[90:28.33]Alright, let's go.
[90:46.99]Hey, Flowers.
[90:48.05]Over here.
[90:48.57]Come on.
[90:49.03]While we're young.
[90:53.20]1945 Grand Paladin.
[90:55.84]Chat, shut the fuck up about the pistol.
[90:57.50]What?
[90:58.36]I think I'm going to get searched.
[91:06.45]Oh, I can't wait till we pour the deli- Wait, he's going to know.
[91:09.45]Doesn't he know his own sommelier?
[91:14.30]You're a lot the bald balder than you were five to ten minutes ago, and you have a different voice and you're jacked I Told you that was gonna happen come on Right I told you this shit was gonna happen Go get the pistol.
[91:32.53]I'm about to get patted down
[91:49.36]What?
[91:50.64]Why did I not kill this guy?
[91:51.70]They both just did like a dance routine.
[91:59.35]Alright, I guess I'll hide it in the trash.
[92:01.41]I guess I'll hide it in a trash can.
[92:08.57]Like I passed a reflex save.
[92:13.34]Passed a reflex save.
[92:21.48]Oh well, the good thing is there's a trash can here.
[92:26.33]Won't this explode?
[92:28.27]I can't place that!
[92:47.19]I can't put this down!
[92:48.49]I can't put this down!
[92:50.75]I have to put- I have to throw it somewhere where no one's gonna touch it.
[92:56.12]I have to put it somewhere where no one is going to walk by it.
[93:03.24]It's proximity.
[93:04.08]I know, but I can't have it on me.
[93:17.51]Gently place an item down.
[93:18.87]You can.
[93:19.43]Yeah, but somebody's going to walk by here.
[93:28.07]It's fucking armed.
[93:29.27]Okay.
[93:37.41]Just pat me down, for the love of God.
[93:41.43]Whatever.
[93:41.75]Let's go.
[93:42.07]I'm going to need to pat you down.
[93:47.69]You seem nervous.
[93:49.56]What does the word proximity mean?
[93:51.62]It means near.
[93:52.88]When you go near it.
[93:54.96]Around.
[93:55.64]In an area.
[93:56.66]I know.
[93:57.38]But what am I supposed to do with it?
[93:59.13]If it arms if I put it on the ground.
[94:00.81]No matter what I do.
[94:01.83]And it's illegal.
[94:05.55]So here's the deal, Flowers.
[94:07.33]Here's the deal.
[94:07.77]The boss is having a powwow with some employees.
[94:09.98]And discretion is the name of the game.
[94:12.49]I'm sure you figured that out already, you being a scholar and all.
[94:15.97]Don't discuss, disclose, or hell, even contemplate what goes down.
[94:20.98]Just set your mind to wool-gathering mode.
[94:24.14]You think you can do that for me, Flowers?
[94:26.72]Worry not, Mr. Cortazar.
[94:29.02]I'm the very soul of discretion.
[94:31.66]Good man.
[94:33.96]Just waiting for someone to walk over there.
[94:35.24]1080 is struggling, MonkaS.
[94:38.37]It is.
[94:40.20]I don't know why we're in an enclosed building.
[94:42.42]Why is my eye twitching?
[94:44.49]I need to poison this.
[94:47.19]I have to poison the wine.
[94:48.81]I need to poison the wine.
[95:09.00]I need to poison the wine.
[95:10.88]Wait a minute.
[95:11.56]Oh, shit.
[95:15.80]Hello, sir.
[95:17.26]Here's your wine.
[95:18.40]No, no.
[95:18.54]Put the shitty one on the table.
[95:20.08]Put the shitty one on the table.
[95:21.67]I'm going to put the really shitty one on the table.
[95:24.17]Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[95:41.99]I'm gonna put the terrible one on the table.
[95:43.51]That everybody hates.
[95:54.46]Which one was it?
[95:56.24]It was their, uh... It was the Pinot, right?
[96:00.72]Was the Pinot the one that they don't like?
[96:02.60]It's the blue one, yep.
[96:03.36]Nobody likes the Pinot.
[96:08.32]Whatever, just...
[96:11.75]Don't go over there and look.
[96:14.25]Good.
[96:14.47]Frisk me.
[96:14.85]Don't go over there and look at anything.
[96:16.01]Please.
[96:16.39]Go.
[96:16.49]Now don't walk over there.
[96:21.02]I want that axe so bad.
[96:22.84]You have no idea.
[96:41.27]It's illegal, I can't.
[96:41.89]Okay, where's the penal?
[97:04.19]This is the shitty one.
[97:05.13]They're all going to be like... And then smash the other one on the table.
[97:08.69]Spill it.
[97:26.94]We're going to do like the Mr. Bean routine where he like breaks the expensive bottle of alcohol or something.
[97:31.48]Everyone like is staring at him.
[97:33.00]Go on.
[97:33.30]Place the wine on the table.
[97:36.99]Alright.
[97:37.23]I have to do the Mr. Bean routine.
[97:38.41]I do.
[97:39.41]Do not save over that one, stupid idiot.
[97:41.83]Here we go.
[97:44.93]I'll pour it.
[97:45.55]He can't.
[97:46.42]Pardon me, Your Majesty.
[97:47.90]I have always considered the Heralds the...
[97:51.32]Wait a minute, I need... Is this to play a few times?
[98:17.69]It was so fucking loud it hurt.
[98:20.17]I need to play this.
[98:21.09]I need to get this recorded.
[98:22.89]Will this pick up through here?
[98:35.88]I need to get this saved.
[98:41.34]I can't alt-tab and click it.
[98:43.86]How do I pull that through?
[98:45.84]Can I pull that through?
[98:48.92]Make your own laugh track.
[98:52.62]I mean, I could.
[99:17.30]That's just a room full of crazy people!
[99:20.42]That's just a room full of weird people!
[99:24.18]That's a room full of stu- That's a- No, that's a room full of- No, no, that doesn't work.
[99:30.19]That doesn't work.
[99:30.65]That doesn't work.
[99:31.73]That doesn't work.
[99:32.17]That's a room full of weird people.
[99:34.91]I have to- I gotta give this 30 more seconds to figure this out.
[99:36.85]I'm gonna do this.
[99:40.88]Fuck, I need a soundboard.
[99:41.80]I need a laugh track soundboard that I can put on this fucking thing.
[99:51.76]Wait, I think I got it.
[99:53.46]Where's my XLR?
[99:57.29]Sampler!
[99:59.71]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[100:00.43]I think I got it.
[100:06.93]It's not gonna work.
[100:11.10]Sampler enabled.
[100:11.92]Nah, I can't alt-tab.
[100:18.88]I have to, like, load it in there.
[100:20.72]It had to have already been prepared, which it wasn't.
[100:24.24]Scary fucking eyes.
[100:29.12]Just do the laughs already.
[100:30.58]You'll need some boos, too.
[100:38.37]If I do this, you let me know if it pulls through here.
[100:40.73]Let me just do it.
[100:41.33]Let me try something really quick.
[100:42.35]I'm going to give this a minute.
[100:43.15]I think it's worth it.
[100:46.61]Routing.
[100:47.07]Here we go.
[100:53.88]I did this.
[100:58.82]Broadcast mix needs to be this.
[101:03.52]Got it.
[101:03.78]Here we go.
[101:04.94]It was too long wait.
[101:27.11]Really?
[101:27.37]No, what the fuck?
[101:34.91]Why?
[101:35.15]Hello?
[101:37.36]Hello?
[101:38.04]What the fuck?
[101:38.46]Why wouldn't it save it?
[101:40.02]Hold on.
[101:40.36]I have an idea.
[101:41.80]I think I have to make a noise.
[101:52.58]It won't do it.
[101:53.38]Never mind.
[101:53.62]Let's go.
[102:08.61]I'm so, I'm so upset.
[102:14.70]I'm upset.
[102:15.24]I had to like have that prepared like two hours ago.
[102:26.72]Alright, what's the shitty one?
[102:27.62]This one.
[102:28.14]Present as the sommelier.

[103:28.25]And when the vineyard was bombed during the closing days of World War II, only a single crate survived.
[103:36.04]It is said to have amazingly complex aromas with long, stable...
[103:57.78]God damn it, man.
[104:00.44]I was trying to break them on the table.
[104:03.58]Well, now I know I can do that.
[104:05.57]Okay.
[104:06.49]Everybody relax.
[104:07.39]Everybody relax.

[104:16.93]the body and limbs of our great organization.
[104:20.73]Ah, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Flowers, our resident sommelier.
[104:25.27]I believe he has brought us something quite special.
[104:29.55]Perhaps you will educate us, Mr. Flowers.
[104:38.35]This is the 1945 Grand Palette.
[104:44.32]one of only five bottles in existence.
[104:47.76]The vintage is legendary, a proverbial unicorn wine.
[104:53.42]The year was hot, the wines super concentrated, and thanks to hail and frost, the production was small.
[105:02.49]Only 300 bottles were ever produced.
[105:05.25]When the vineyard was bombed in the early days of World War II,

[105:53.06]I put it down on the table already.
[106:02.49]This is the 1945 Grand Paladin.
[106:07.87]One of only five bottles in existence.
[106:11.63]He just burped?
[106:12.85]He just drank out of that and burped?
[106:16.10]He just drank out of that and burped?
[106:17.40]The air was hot, the wines super concentrated, and thanks to hail and frost, the production was small.
[106:25.22]Only 300 bottles were ever produced.
[106:28.81]When the vineyard was bombed during the closing days of World War II,
[106:33.73]Only a single crate survives.
[106:36.99]It is said to have amazingly complex flavors with long, savory layers of fruit and spice flavors and a silky texture.
[106:47.61]Enjoy.
[106:49.53]Thank you, Mr. Flowers.
[106:50.93]Feel free to stick around in case our guests have questions.
[106:55.32]This wine was gifted to me by the Ark Society in acknowledgment of my first...
[107:03.11]And by the way, this is where they come from, these grapes.
[107:07.01]We are but a few and yet together we are unstoppable because we stand united.
[107:10.31]My friends, loyalty is everything.
[107:22.74]Which is why we cannot allow traitors into our ranks.
[107:27.26]Ah, yes.
[107:28.27]Here it comes.
[107:29.47]This woman has waged bloody war on us.
[107:32.43]Diana.
[107:32.75]More than a dozen heralds and operatives dead.
[107:35.61]Your colleagues and clients.
[107:37.73]My friend, Ken Morgan.
[107:39.87]Not to mention the partners themselves.
[107:41.79]Is he going to press a Dr. Evil button and someone's going to fly back?
[107:44.03]Our benefactors.
[107:46.28]Make no mistake.
[107:48.00]This woman's hands are soaked in blood.
[107:50.42]Our blood.
[107:51.70]And Arthur...
[107:52.88]The new supreme head of Providence is handing her the keys to the kingdom.
[108:00.07]Now, does that seem right to you, my friends?
[108:02.41]Does that sound like loyalty?
[108:04.73]Oh, I agree.
[108:05.85]Yes.
[108:06.17]What's up, you fucking weirdo?
[108:09.47]Oh, you want to see a magic drink?
[108:13.18]Come on over here.
[108:14.16]I'm going to make this pencil disappear.
[108:17.30]I dare say I am in the lead.
[108:19.70]Don, what the hell?
[108:21.38]You're lying, of course, which only proves my point.
[108:24.77]You cannot be trusted, Miss Burnwood.
[108:27.67]This woman will be our downfall.
[108:30.61]That is, unless we take matters into our own hands.
[108:33.73]You are heralds sworn to protect Providence against all threats, including inside ones.
[108:41.41]I have devised a plan.
[108:44.07]Together we can make it work, but you have to decide now, my friends.
[108:51.45]I think you jumped the gun a little.
[108:54.22]You didn't wait for the cheese to come out.
[108:58.34]That's when you should have.
[109:01.80]Diana?
[109:02.52]Hey!
[109:02.96]That's my friend!
[109:07.81]You fucking asshole!
[109:11.15]Don't fuck with me!
[109:12.45]Or my friend!
[109:14.37]Ever!
[109:17.38]We'll have to watch the whole thing again.
[109:21.45]Sorry, I just flew off the handle there.
[109:27.98]Oh shit, we have to watch the whole thing.
[109:31.50]Sorry.
[109:33.52]Wait, it saved it?
[109:34.00]Did it actually just save right there?
[109:54.93]Auto-saved.
[109:56.15]They knew you would do it.
[110:13.65]I can't help it.
[110:15.77]I can't fucking do it.
[110:17.15]This is like you give...
[110:27.69]I can't play Hitman normally.
[110:29.68]I never would be able to.
[110:30.46]It's like if a pigeon could play video games.
[110:35.12]This will not go your way.
[111:13.55]Why him?
[111:14.11]Because he was the closest.
[111:22.71]I scored Miss Burnwood to my office.
[111:25.26]I'll join you shortly.
[111:30.72]Right.
[111:31.64]Move it.
[111:31.96]Let's go.
[111:35.74]I'm warning you, Yates.
[111:37.27]This will not go your way.
[111:39.51]It's not going to go the way that you think.
[111:47.05]We need to get our story straight.
[111:50.29]Diana Byrne was died today by a band of heroic Agent 47.
[112:02.30]Revenge for her changing sides.
[112:05.46]This is what you will all attest to.
[112:10.54]Yes.
[112:11.22]Yes.
[112:11.92]Yes.
[112:12.30]Yes.
[112:12.94]I agree.
[112:14.16]Yes.
[112:17.26]Uh.
[112:17.34]That sounds like a house of cards.
[112:19.86]That's usually not the way things should be run.
[112:21.54]Kill him.
[112:42.37]Time limit.
[112:42.75]That's a good one.
[112:43.21]Holy shit, nice.
[112:43.93]Alright.
[112:44.17]Let me in.
[112:44.55]Does he even care that I'm going to unlock this door?
[113:17.04]They don't even care that I'm doing this.
[113:18.24]Alright, where's Diana?
[113:19.34]You're supposed to poison them all.
[113:25.54]He's your target.
[113:26.17]Kill him.
[113:26.69]Glass him.
[113:29.63]Glass him.
[113:32.55]Throw him.
[113:33.15]Jerm of the target.
[113:33.91]I have to get to Diana.
[113:37.29]Do I have ten minutes to kill him?
[113:50.52]What are they searching for?
[113:54.80]No, save Diana.
[113:55.84]Get to Diana.
[113:58.31]Oh, you shit.
[114:05.23]New costume.
[114:05.93]Let's go.
[114:06.59]Come here.
[114:08.51]Come here.
[114:08.89]Come here.
[114:09.23]Come here.
[114:09.69]Come here.
[114:10.13]Come here.
[114:11.73]Come here.
[114:12.03]You know what?
[114:13.89]It's okay.
[114:14.13]That's what you have the saves coming for.
[114:15.99]That's why you do what you do.
[114:21.54]Blast light him.
[114:30.67]Please, Jeremy, you have to focus.
[114:31.73]You can't focus for more than five minutes.
[114:33.03]You're a muppet.
[114:33.69]I can't take it anymore.
[114:44.27]Only half of what you said was true.
[114:58.89]Can I be... I'm hidden in here, right?
[115:09.16]What is over... What is that?
[115:11.62]Cheers?
[115:20.45]I gotta get rid of this guy.
[115:24.69]Bring on the Jerma Muppet.
[115:33.86]If you're looking for top 10 Hitman gameplay, this is the channel to watch.
[115:39.74]Don't leave.
[115:40.30]Stay here.
[115:40.93]Don't leave my channel.
[115:41.97]I'm gonna do very well.
[115:44.25]Don't click the X. Stay.
[115:45.15]Stay.
[116:00.70]And name another channel, you'll see that.
[116:02.88]Name another channel where you'll see that.
[116:06.48]You're not going to.
[116:12.89]I just have to be honest.
[116:13.81]You're not going to find a channel that can do that.
[116:15.97]Not one channel will be able to do what I just did.
[116:28.74]Alright, we gotta go up.
[116:30.56]How much time do I have?
[116:31.20]Six minutes?
[116:41.72]Alright, I can go in here now.
[116:43.36]Let's go up to Diana.
[116:44.45]I need a staircase over here.
[116:49.25]Alright, I've got plenty of time to get to Diana.
[116:56.40]And again, I have to reference the census here.
[117:00.10]Literally 13% of people that were censor-sized don't want to see me play the game the normal way.
[117:07.29]We have a censor-sizer.
[117:08.21]Wow.
[117:17.23]What was that?
[117:21.94]Command.
[117:23.00]I just heard a weird noise.
[117:24.04]I'm moving in to investigate.
[117:32.50]uncensored well come down and look at it already
[118:04.95]That guy's not going to look behind, right?
[118:06.79]Don't look behind you.
[118:07.95]Don't look behind you.
[118:08.63]He's looking behind him.
[118:10.39]Stay there.
[118:15.54]Come.
[118:23.68]Kill him.
[118:23.94]He's seeing your face.
[118:26.30]I don't care.
[118:26.66]He's not getting up.
[118:28.86]As long as he doesn't get up in five minutes, I'll be fine.
[118:33.68]What about the umbrella?
[118:35.02]That's a good call.
[118:52.57]Hi, I made it.
[118:53.13]Take out the top floor guards.
[118:57.75]Okay.
[119:20.76]One more guy over here.
[119:29.27]Holy shit, that was close.
[119:39.89]Kills.
[119:40.71]Lethal poison.
[119:46.86]Oh, you're outside.
[119:47.52]Okay.
[119:49.91]The house is haunted.
[120:07.98]Wait!
[120:10.72]Poison the glass of red wine.
[120:12.39]With a lethal po- with a lethal poison.
[120:15.09]He's gonna sit there and he's gonna drink out of it probably.
[120:19.65]Alright, I'm here, Diana.
[120:21.21]Good.
[120:22.03]I was beginning to worry.
[120:23.34]Were you?
[120:24.12]No.
[120:25.38]Listen up, 47.
[120:26.78]Yates will be here shortly.
[120:28.76]He'll have his thug, Cortazar, do his dirty work, but he won't pass up on the chance for a good gloat and a monolog.
[120:35.20]So, private space?
[120:38.50]Kill room decor?
[120:40.22]Exactly.
[120:41.42]We won't get another shot at this.
[120:43.56]Now sit down and blend in.
[120:45.84]When I provide a distraction, you just be ready to move.
[121:05.61]Distract him.
[121:06.31]Go distract him.
[121:06.97]Distract him.
[121:07.39]You have to distract him.
[121:10.44]Distract him.
[121:12.36]Distract this guy.
[121:13.20]Distract him.
[121:16.06]Oh, fuck.
[121:21.83]Dump him over the fucking railing.
[121:25.41]Dump him over the railing.
[121:33.64]Don't roll off.
[121:34.76]Stay there.
[121:35.50]Fuck.
[121:38.74]Hold on.
[121:39.10]Where?
[121:39.30]How?
[121:39.64]Hold on.
[121:40.16]I got so distracted.
[121:41.28]It's right here, right?
[121:43.48]1758.
[121:43.54]Right here.
[122:05.67]Why don't you just stand there?
[122:06.60]Because I knew I was going to reload and just do it again.
[122:10.10]You didn't need to do that.
[122:12.76]You thought you were slick, buddy.
[122:15.64]What a surprise.
[122:16.20]Did you fuck it all up?
[122:46.94]Alright, poison.
[122:48.88]What am I gonna poison?
[122:49.62]There's only one guy to kill, then they come up.
[122:55.53]Let me deal with this first.
[123:00.21]Should I poison the glass?
[123:04.29]Kill him with the chandelier.
[123:06.55]I could kill... I could.
[123:07.45]Here's the poison.
[123:10.86]Release the ladder?
[123:11.92]What?
[123:12.68]Why does this guy have like a booby-trapped house?
[123:19.04]Poisoned glass.
[123:20.12]There's a battle axe on the wall.
[123:30.65]Hold on, let me... Wait a minute.
[123:34.59]Calendar?
[123:39.63]On the 2021 calendar in the Yates house, a date has been circled with the board's crystal anniversary scribbled alongside.
[123:44.07]Hmm.
[123:50.73]Kill him with the calendar.
[123:57.03]Alright, now I got a minute here.
[123:58.99]I'm just going to drop the chandelier on him.
[124:00.89]Like hit me in one.
[124:01.79]Did I poison the glass?
[124:12.28]I'm just going to poison the wine here.
[124:13.76]This is definitely, you poison this.
[124:15.70]Battleaxe, battleaxe, use the battleaxe.
[124:18.93]Get the fucking battleaxe.
[124:20.67]No.
[124:21.07]Get the battleaxe.
[124:30.62]Go into the attic.
[124:32.52]Into the attic.
[124:33.24]Attic.
[124:33.62]Attic.
[124:33.98]Attic.
[124:41.06]What's up here?
[124:47.55]Oh my god, there's a sniper rifle here.
[124:55.54]Cannonballs?
[124:57.66]Wait, can I shoot a cannon at him?
[125:05.51]Bag of gunpowder.
[125:10.57]Broadsword?
[125:14.43]Where's the cannon I can shoot at him?
[125:19.93]Just no-scope him with the rifle.
[125:21.47]We're gonna have to kill this guy a few different ways.
[125:23.71]Where's the cannon?
[125:37.02]Out in front of the house, there's a cannon.
[125:44.38]Holy shit, there's a cannon right there.
[125:53.55]Alright, I'm going to go arm the cannon and I'm going to shoot him with a cannon when he comes over here.
[126:12.51]Is this going to work?
[126:14.79]Nice thinking, dude.
[126:15.63]Yeah.
[126:19.36]Let me see.
[126:19.74]Can I even do this?
[126:25.86]I drop down?
[126:35.40]Not loaded.
[126:49.95]Not loaded.
[126:50.51]Yes, it is.
[126:54.43]Load gunpowder.
[127:01.51]Um, so I... Are they gonna know it's me?
[127:11.36]I'm gonna be sitting here holding a string ready to pull the cannon when he walks up.
[127:15.82]Are they gonna know I did it?
[127:19.58]Okay, well, let's... Let's go.
[127:21.81]I'm gonna talk to Diana.
[127:26.87]Diana.
[127:31.43]And I'm going to run back out there and I'm going to shoot him with a fucking cannon.
[127:35.74]Good.
[127:36.56]I was beginning to worry.
[127:37.88]Were you?
[127:38.62]No.
[127:39.88]Listen up, Roy.
[127:41.32]Yates will be here shortly.
[127:43.34]He'll have his son's books after his dirty work.
[127:49.73]So, private space?
[127:53.05]Kill room decor?
[128:24.20]Corva, what?
[128:24.60]Pick up your damn phone.
[129:04.96]Go on a roll!
[129:05.78]Oh.
[129:48.01]I blew it with the cannon, so I'm going to just do whatever.
[129:50.15]I'm going to do this.
[129:51.53]Wait, does he?
[129:52.17]Maybe he tries to escape in his car.
[129:55.51]Wait.
[129:57.03]What if he tries to run away in his car?
[130:03.41]Good.
[130:04.23]I was beginning to worry.
[130:05.29]Hide the body.
[130:06.11]No.
[130:07.56]Listen up, 47.
[130:07.96]Yate will be here shortly.
[130:10.98]He'll have his thug, Cortazar, do his dirty work, but he won't pass up on the chance for a good blow and a monolog.
[130:17.31]Is that everybody?
[130:19.25]Okay, here he comes.
[130:23.64]I'm going to save it right here.
[130:24.84]Sit down and blend in.
[130:49.55]I'm holding, I'm just like holding a gun.
[131:05.68]Make a little hand shot first.
[131:07.56]Oh, fuck.
[131:07.88]I'm blowing it.
[131:09.16]I saved it.
[131:32.64]Come on, just connect to the internet for the love of God.
[131:39.95]Miss Burnwood.
[131:41.39]You rolled out the red carpet just for me.
[131:44.43]Don, you shouldn't have.
[131:46.61]So confident, even in defeat.
[131:49.41]I suppose you're not used to danger always safe behind your screens.
[131:54.03]Just tell me one thing before we part ways.
[131:57.22]Why me?
[131:58.14]Why me?
[132:00.35]Why would Edwards trust you?
[132:03.79]Wait, is Diana dead?
[132:18.87]Oh, she is now.
[132:21.13]Oh.
[132:21.31]Well done, 47.
[132:22.97]Better get rid of the body.
[132:24.35]Won't be long before they come looking.
[132:29.47]When you're done...
[132:34.84]Why are you alive?
[132:35.52]That's impossible, it's literally impossible shot her right in the fucking head around What happened?
[133:03.68]No way!
[133:04.56]That's impossible!
[133:07.19]This is not possible.
[133:17.95]God damn it!
[133:18.77]Fucking get it!
[133:19.35]Right there.
[133:24.55]You dead?
[133:42.88]How did I get it the last time?

[134:18.37]I shot her directly in the fucking head this mouse pad is seven feet long miss burnwood you rolled out the red carpet just for me okay what does she do you shouldn't have so confident even in defeat
[134:39.25]What should I do?
[134:40.19]Turn off your DPI.
[134:42.81]Don't tell me what to do.
[134:43.79]Just tell me one thing before we part ways.
[134:47.03]Why me?
[134:47.95]Why you?
[134:50.16]Why would Edwards trust you?
[134:53.56]Please.
[134:54.56]It will keep me awake at night.
[134:55.94]Enter full?
[134:57.24]I get up four times to piss as it is.
[134:59.52]Oh, it's simple, really.
[135:01.24]Edwards is proud.
[135:02.94]He considers himself the cleverest man alive, and yet we tricked him on Isle of Scale, and it's eating him up.
[135:09.57]He needs to win.
[135:11.17]Full, unequivocal victory.
[135:14.26]My recruitment was just the feather in his cap.
[135:17.04]By the way, you were right about one thing.
[135:19.92]It was me.
[135:21.02]Stab in the stomach.
[135:23.00]Stab in the stomach.
[135:23.68]Right in the stomach.
[135:24.52]Got him.
[135:26.37]What are you going to say now?
[135:28.99]What are you going to say now?
[135:30.27]What are you doing, you asshole?
[135:43.92]I will be constant.
[135:45.82]And I will make it my mission to tear down Providence brick by brick.
[135:52.95]Finish it.
[135:59.67]Well done, 47.
[136:01.35]Better get rid of the body.
[136:02.73]Won't be long before they come looking.
[136:05.32]Brick by brick.
[136:05.96]When you're done, meet me on the dance floor.
[136:08.60]Oh, and dress appropriately.
[136:10.94]I will dress appropriately.
[136:31.85]I'm gonna shoot her with the cannon.
[136:33.13]I have to.
[136:54.89]She's already down there!
[136:55.81]How'd she get down there that fast?
[137:00.15]Disguise yourself appropriately.
[137:01.47]I think I already... I am already, aren't I?
[137:04.57]Sniper.
[137:09.73]Am I not disguised appropriately?
[137:10.77]Oh, I need his suit.
[137:13.43]Got it.
[137:53.63]And that's another sniper!
[137:57.05]He was fucking waiting for me on the roof!
[138:05.12]That shit's not happening.
[138:11.18]How do I get down?
[138:26.00]How am I supposed to get out of here?
[138:26.80]Not the front door?
[138:32.94]I can't like drop.
[138:38.36]Why can I not drop down?
[138:41.44]Leave.
[138:42.10]I can't drop down.
[138:42.84]Was somebody down there on the computer?
[139:13.60]You have to drop the sniper rifle.
[139:14.96]Drop the sniper rifle.
[139:16.56]Oh, fuck.
[139:17.10]Okay.
[139:17.46]Is that what's going on?
[139:18.19]Did I kill him?
[139:27.36]That's the same lawyer from the other level.
[139:45.84]Alright, I'm out.
[139:48.54]Getting out, getting out.
[139:54.60]Oh, no, it's okay.
[140:20.23]What?
[140:20.39]Alright, that was... Okay.
[140:23.63]I just think Moon walked off the roof.
[140:47.94]Oh, I got the shortcut to a back door.
[140:50.42]Okay, I'm not trespassing anymore.
[140:51.50]I'm done.
[140:52.34]Can you let me in?
[140:52.90]Of course.
[141:08.59]I believe.
[141:10.89]Good, Anakin.
[141:11.53]Good.
[141:16.00]I can't believe... I wanted to use the cannon.
[141:19.43]Oh, this is where we dance.
[141:22.63]This is where we dance!
[141:26.92]Local boomer can't find exit.
[141:28.12]I'm right here!
[141:37.18]Diana, look what I swiped.
[141:40.85]Fucking don't.
[141:41.69]I hate this.
[141:43.29]You're just taking me out of the game.
[141:44.45]You're taking me out of my immersion.
[141:46.83]I want to break my own immersion, okay?
[141:50.86]I want to be playing Hitman, put a chef costume on, and, like, throw the wine bottle at the guy's head while I play a laugh track.
[141:58.22]Let me do my own immersion breaking.
[141:59.56]I don't want you to do it for me.
[142:00.48]Alright, let's go.
[142:19.09]Resist the temptation, I know.
[142:25.59]It's done.
[142:26.91]Now what?
[142:28.99]Now, strike at the heart.
[142:32.95]Edwards.
[142:34.19]That's cold, 47.
[142:34.73]What the fuck are you?
[142:36.84]Why Edwards finds you, 47.
[142:39.70]He is untraceable, and he never lets you forget it.
[142:42.96]He is cocky, and that will be his downfall.
[142:46.90]What's the plan?
[142:48.16]Too many eyes.
[142:49.44]Meet me at the Olive Grove at sunset.
[142:51.96]One last tango, 47.
[142:53.10]Meet me at the Olive Garden, 47.
[143:26.55]32,000 XP.
[143:27.53]Doesn't matter.
[143:27.95]I got a zero.
[143:31.73]At least I'm leveling up.
[143:53.51]Let me ask you a question, though.
[143:54.49]Okay.
[143:56.02]Without the non-target kill penalty of being 50,000, what is a decent mission score for a hitman level?
[144:09.65]What is it?
[144:09.99]150k is good.
[144:14.97]100k is good.
[144:15.35]100k.
[144:15.49]60k plus.
[144:15.69]100k.
[144:15.75]Okay.
[144:15.95]So what did I get? 34,000?
[144:29.02]50k is decent, 100k is great.
[144:30.30]Okay.
[144:34.00]50k minimum is alright.
[144:38.70]Ooh, I got like a hot heat gun.
[144:46.18]Started the vineyard, started the parking lot, the boathouse, the bathroom.
[144:50.66]Okay, cool.
[144:54.37]Alright, I'm gonna turn Cam off.
[144:55.29]This is like one of the final cutscenes, right?
[144:56.97]This is the last level.
[144:59.17]This is it.
[144:59.51]This is the final level of the game.
[145:01.01]Do I play as Diana?
[145:07.40]That'd be kind of cool.
[145:14.27]What?
[145:16.09]How did you know?
[145:18.23]Your deal.
[145:20.03]That kind of power always comes with a price.
[145:23.37]What's yours?
[145:25.87]I think you know.
[145:29.59]Oh, yeah, it was a setup.
[145:33.35]I am sorry.
[145:35.17]This is a necessary evil.
[145:39.25]What have you done?
[145:40.97]The heat gun.
[145:42.70]The brand neurotoxin transfers by touch.
[145:46.86]See, Edwards learns by his mistakes, 47.
[145:50.24]And as you've clearly demonstrated, brute force is futile.
[145:55.50]It had to be me.
[145:57.71]It was the only way.
[145:59.40]To get this class.
[146:02.36]My family.
[146:04.56]I know what you did.
[146:06.64]After all these years, I finally know.
[146:11.49]I am sorry.
[146:14.15]You didn't have a choice.
[146:16.27]I did.
[146:17.47]Providence used you, but I'm no better.
[146:21.12]All I saw was a blank slate.
[146:23.06]A weapon to wield.
[146:24.62]This is when I put my hand up and start shaking my fist.
[146:29.48]And the crowd starts screaming.
[146:30.54]Hulk Hogan starts to get on one knee.
[146:32.14]The Ultimate Warriors just towering over him.
[146:34.50]The power.
[146:35.02]He gains it.
[146:35.98]Shaking his fist back and forth.
[146:37.32]Goodbye, Agent.
[146:48.48]Are you guys telling me to shut up?
[146:49.90]You care about the storyline here?
[146:58.03]We just saw it.
[147:01.07]This is important.
[147:03.03]We care about feet.
[147:09.12]What?
[147:12.46]You guys are fucking crazy.
[147:21.31]This is untouchable.
[147:22.48]Briefing for untouchable.
[147:28.74]Wait, is this going to be like a weird I'm in a dream sequence?
[147:34.95]Don't forget about the wine crusher save file.

[149:06.09]I remember that one.
[149:07.41]I remember that guy.
[149:08.33]I remember that DJ.
[149:09.91]I remember that lady.
[149:12.29]How could you possibly function on your own?
[149:16.19]You never even had a name.
[149:19.51]Until I gave you one.
[149:23.97]That's him.
[149:26.03]Burnwood never ceases to surprise me.
[149:29.86]You really are a most singular individual.
[149:33.90]And to think she wanted me to put you down.
[149:38.00]Lucky for you, I never throw away anything useful.
[149:44.07]Prepare the serum.
[149:47.97]Forgetting's not so bad.
[149:49.39]You've done it before.

[150:32.30]Gotta get your head straight.
[150:50.50]She wants me dead.
[150:52.42]She has every right to after what we did.
[150:55.50]But that's not what is really going on.
[150:59.94]She chose power.
[151:02.25]In the end, she was just like them.
[151:04.35]No.
[151:05.69]She found a way to turn Edward's own cleverness against him.
[151:10.31]The rest is up to you.
[151:13.29]I don't know how.
[151:15.57]You do know.
[151:17.51]Diana!
[151:22.28]I'm Diana's son.
[151:22.96]No, I'm not.
[151:23.92]I killed everybody.
[151:24.66]And her whole family.
[151:25.42]Okay.
[151:25.62]Okay.
[151:59.19]How did you come to that conclusion?
[152:06.60]Eliminate Arthur Edwards.
[152:08.30]Providence members may be eliminated.
[152:10.86]Really?
[152:12.90]Well... I want him to come in here.
[152:25.31]Did I cough?
[152:34.52]But we have tools.
[152:35.24]I'm going to really freak this guy out.
[152:37.88]Watch this.
[152:38.24]Ready?
[152:50.34]This is impossible, right?
[153:11.34]Why is the guy so slow?
[153:12.56]Yeah.
[153:16.52]He's cleaning it?
[153:17.26]They actually clean it?
[153:18.14]I'm awake, by the way.
[153:23.57]Look at that keycard.
[153:30.23]Oh, by the way, all Providence members can be eliminated.
[153:33.73]Would you look at that?
[153:47.47]Facecam, facecam.
[154:00.65]Where is Arthur?
[154:03.49]Oh, open.
[154:11.40]Arthur?
[154:13.62]No, blend in as a doctor.
[154:15.10]Okay.
[154:39.72]Pluck out childhood traumas.
[154:41.96]Ugly breakups.
[154:43.69]Combat trauma.
[154:44.67]Jim Carrey movie about this.
[154:46.23]I should be over the moon.
[154:47.73]What are you talking about?
[154:48.91]I love waking up in a cold sweat with a scream stuck in my throat.
[154:55.95]So, what would you call it then?
[154:58.34]You're catchy off the couch.
[155:00.30]I don't know.
[155:01.68]Blank Slaterzine?
[155:03.20]You are.
[155:04.74]The Ether Serum, a technical report on Ether's new memory-repressing neural inhibitor serum.
[155:10.34]The formula is reverse-engineered and enhanced by a much older prototype created at the Institute for Human Betterment in Romania in the 1980s.
[155:18.24]An antidote produced at Ether's R&D site in Johannesburg was stolen by Lucas Gray during his assault on the facility.
[155:24.87]I don't care.
[155:27.03]Come on, Jim, was it?
[155:30.02]It always starts like this.
[155:32.12]GPS, microwaves, duct tape.
[155:34.84]This serum will eventually improve lives.
[155:37.85]I've got to believe that.
[155:39.19]These are Providence members.
[155:42.15]Those are Providence members in there.
[155:45.15]They need to die, right?
[155:45.73]Right?
[155:55.64]Oh, fuck.
[155:55.98]They're coming this way.
[155:57.22]Oh, my God.

[156:32.79]Oh my god.
[156:39.43]Hey, I just want to let everybody in here know.
[156:41.27]This kid just picked up a crowbar.
[156:48.86]You're a fucking Providence member.
[156:56.12]Where'd the crowbar go?
[156:56.76]Did it break on his head?
[156:57.90]Wait, what?
[157:08.32]It broke on his head.
[157:09.56]Well, whatever.
[157:37.44]I can't leave.
[157:37.96]I need that crowbar.
[157:50.19]Well, shit.
[157:55.47]I didn't know it was gonna break.
[158:04.07]Mind wiped.
[158:04.31]1979.
[158:04.33]Beep beep.
[158:04.59]Do a fart sound, sure.
[158:48.21]Or a train.
[158:48.83]I mean, I have to get rid of... I have to throw them out.
[159:03.34]Very important.
[159:04.06]Huh?
[159:16.82]Where are you gonna go?
[159:18.16]Run that way.
[159:18.82]No, the other way.
[159:20.86]Run the other way.
[159:21.64]Run the other way.
[159:22.26]Run the other way.
[159:22.84]Run...
[159:54.98]I wish I could see.
[159:57.52]Wait, I want that, uh... Should I disguise as a doctor or disguise as him?
[160:01.72]Probably him, right?
[160:02.38]That's a security guard.
[160:10.27]Where the hell are we going?
[160:16.72]Mall cop.
[160:22.14]Okay.
[160:25.02]I gotta hang on the ledge.
[160:26.96]This seems dangerous.
[160:27.82]Is this dangerous?
[160:42.79]What the fuck just happened?
[160:44.63]What's going on?
[160:45.85]What is going on right now?
[160:48.91]I'm walking on the... This is a little bizarre.
[161:01.52]I guess I'm... Gonna keep going?
[161:04.90]No, what if this... Can I climb that?
[161:13.34]Can I get like... Am I gonna get hit in the head by like a fucking highway sign?
[161:41.24]Gotta keep.
[161:47.59]RT dude.
[161:48.51]Oh, that just blew by my head.
[161:51.47]That was very close.
[161:54.91]What is going on in there?
[161:55.69]Place valve.
[162:04.94]Valve.
[162:09.84]Is there a valve I can get?
[162:27.51]Where's this valve?
[162:39.92]Valve in here, right?
[162:41.38]Unlock cabinet.
[162:42.12]What the fuck?
[162:48.94]Oh, I... Okay.
[162:58.40]Turn it on.
[163:05.30]I haven't saved it in like five seconds.
[163:07.22]Big mistake.
[163:11.80]There's a shitload of people in here.
[163:12.84]Can I just drop a grenade?
[163:15.02]Can't get hit by it.
[163:16.66]You cannot get hit by those.
[163:18.50]That should have hit me right in the fucking groin.
[163:21.41]You cannot get hit by these.
[163:30.43]I took that right in the stomach.
[163:33.67]Will it kill me?
[163:41.08]I don't think you can die by this.
[163:50.06]You're freezing?
[163:51.98]I'm freezing to death?
[163:53.59]That's what's killing me?
[163:55.41]That's what kills me?
[164:04.93]Where the hell am I?
[164:13.70]You would have been split in half.
[164:15.34]I know.
[164:16.86]I would be in the stratosphere right now.
[164:29.74]Just skip it.
[164:30.16]I don't even need to fight those guys.
[164:31.21]Why would I fight them?
[164:43.97]Alright, wait a minute.
[164:47.17]Got a can of soda?
[164:48.83]We've got... That's it.
[164:51.02]Just a can of soda.
[165:14.98]Can't... Don't go over this?
[165:21.17]He's freezing.
[165:22.01]Fuck!
[165:30.02]Get in!
[165:34.86]The Ether Corporation bought this train for sample backup storage.
[165:39.04]But since the bombing of their R&D site in Johannesburg, they're refitting the cars as a mobile field lab.
[165:47.10]So what did the Russians use it for back in the day?
[165:49.46]The way I hear it, this used to be some kind of cagey black site.
[165:52.66]Shoot them.
[165:53.46]You have a gun.
[165:54.10]Shoot them.
[165:54.48]That's not getting me in bad rating.
[165:56.82]But at one point,
[166:01.12]No, it won't.
[166:01.50]It won't?
[166:01.74]No.
[166:01.80]It's not going to give me a bad rating?
[166:03.96]How did this guy not hear that?
[166:32.87]I've got a body on the ground.
[166:35.13]I'm moving in.
[166:46.60]Holy crap!
[166:48.92]Holy crap!
[167:02.54]Alright, let me investigate a little.
[167:03.84]Hold on.

[167:16.39]Oh, man.
[167:18.84]Tactical shotgun.

[167:54.67]Pick up the soap.
[167:55.37]Pick up the soap.
[167:56.05]Go back and kill the other guys.
[167:58.07]Oh, it's too late.
[167:59.94]They're so far back.
[168:08.88]Nothing.
[168:12.12]Nothing.
[168:15.26]Wait, this is a secret door.
[168:17.44]Locked from the other side.

[168:55.48]Oh, it's been auto-saving, isn't it?
[169:00.96]I don't have... I can't unlock the door.
[169:03.93]Who had keys?
[169:06.27]Which one of you guys had keys on them?
[169:09.55]Somebody had a key.
[169:12.15]Not you.
[169:13.97]Not you.

[181:41.08]I don't suppose there's any point calling for help?
[181:45.18]No.
[181:46.66]Seems I brought this on myself.
[181:49.48]Well played, Miss Burnwood.
[181:53.31]Do you really think she'll be able to resist all that power?
[181:57.91]This is not how people work.
[182:01.37]She rejects the power, not the responsibility.
[182:07.11]A noble idea.
[182:10.05]I thought there was another 47 over there trying to kill me.
[182:14.25]I trust you already know what this is.
[182:17.54]Why not simply take it?
[182:20.50]Embrace who you were always meant to be.
[182:24.94]Then?
[182:26.34]No.
[182:27.28]Never again.
[182:30.67]Well, I had to try.
[182:33.71]Go on, then.
[182:35.73]Do your thing.
[182:37.97]At least I died knowing who I am.
[182:40.03]Should I give him the super serum?
[183:01.77]Yeah, sure.
[183:04.45]What are you doing?
[183:06.75]no no this is what it means to lose everything you're making a mistake it's mine to make what does that what does that thing do oh forgive me I seem to have uh what were we talking about don't worry we were done
[183:46.34]Did I just get the good ending?
[184:01.52]I can't wait till he goes like... Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yes!
[184:07.65]credits roll nightmare fuel completed new deal I don't want to see a new deal it looks like new deal reload the last save file and kill one person only and one billion is wiped from the debt
[184:40.18]New deal, finished the game twice.
[184:55.93]Oh, get me off the screen.
[184:58.01]It's been a long time, Agent 47.
[185:03.09]That's not who I am anymore.
[185:07.05]The name's Greg.
[185:08.83]It's Greg 47.
[185:17.89]V-O-R-T-I-E-Z-E-V-E-N.
[185:33.09]I choose this path because I can.
[185:37.21]There will always be people like them.
[185:40.35]So there will always be people like us.
[185:45.43]It's good to be back.
[185:53.09]Cool.
[185:58.34]Alright.
[186:04.56]Smile.
[186:05.14]Hitman 3.
[186:09.88]Cool.
[186:11.35]Very cool.
[186:18.66]Button masher.
[186:34.35]I got 94,000 points.
[186:37.35]That's the best I've ever had.
[186:38.79]That's 100k.
[186:40.01]Somebody's 100k was good.
[186:41.03]That's the first time I've ever had more than zero points.
[186:48.18]Holy shit.
[186:51.14]Whoa.
[186:51.82]I got three stars.
[187:02.66]No recordings.
[187:03.56]No bodies found.
[187:05.78]And the objective complete.
[187:10.52]Nice.
[187:15.25]Out of the lab.
[187:16.25]Cool.
[187:16.61]Okay.
[187:17.53]Cool.
[187:19.99]That was cool.
[187:52.04]What happens now?
[188:03.99]It's the same thing?
[188:04.89]It's the same thing.
[188:14.71]Is it?
[188:25.12]New Deal.
[188:25.60]Same thing.
[188:29.47]Inject yourself with the serum.
[189:00.96]Just take the serum.
[189:04.41]Grind XP.
[189:12.43]Take the serum myself.
[189:15.85]Ow.
[189:22.80]Wait, hold on, can I... Can I stop the train?
[189:38.77]Just wait.
[189:45.63]Hold it and wait.
[189:48.31]Hold the serum and wait.
[189:48.97]I have to wait 47 seconds?
[190:06.95]Lucas Gray was haunted by his humanity... ...but freedom from choice is also freedom.
[190:13.87]Everything is so much simpler in black and white.
[190:25.30]Thank you, my friend.
[190:26.38]I will take care of you now.
[190:30.67]All will be well.
[190:35.85]Wake up!
[190:37.47]wake up my friend it's the dawn of a new day and you have things to do how does that change how does that change the ending
[191:02.01]That's it.
[191:02.88]You just wake up on a weird bed.
[191:05.56]That was the start of Hitman 1.
[191:14.46]What?
[191:19.53]That's the start of Hitman 1?
[191:20.89]So wait, is that the true ending?
[191:30.58]Yeah, I have played all of them.
[191:31.86]I haven't played Hitman 1 since I was probably like 17.
[191:37.18]Like 18 or something.
[191:38.20]It's been a long time.
[191:44.60]I can prove that I played the original Hitman 1.
[191:46.32]Because remember the mansion level with the lady ran up the stairs.
[191:51.69]It was a mansion and it would be a... They were speaking... They weren't speaking English.
[191:55.55]What were they saying?
[191:57.99]They ran up the stairs and like you have to shoot the lady going up the stairs.
[192:05.29]That's Absolution.
[192:05.93]No, it's not.
[192:06.31]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[192:10.07]That's all the games.
[192:14.83]That's most Hitman games.
[192:16.95]Well, a lady running up the stairs, not speaking English, and you push her down the stairs.
[192:20.37]I mean, I guess you could do that in all of them.
[192:22.93]But I mean, this is... Whatever.
[192:29.26]Alright.
[192:29.72]I'm just going to grind up a bunch of people now.
[192:45.39]Never touch this fucking franchise again.
[192:48.73]Well, guess what?
[192:51.33]It's over.
[192:52.55]They ain't making any more Hitman games.
[192:55.71]The trilogy of assassination is over.
[192:59.19]You're never gonna see me play this again.
[193:02.15]Until Hitman... How do I get her to move?
[193:06.65]She's like freaking out.
[193:19.05]Walk in.
[193:20.05]Walk in.
[193:21.30]Walk in.
[193:29.04]Walk in, Diana.
[193:32.40]Diana, walk in.
[193:42.47]Shoot her in.
[193:45.01]Push her in.
[193:45.35]I couldn't push her.
[193:51.25]A shooter.
[193:55.45]Interesting.
[193:56.80]Are those cooling sockets?
[193:58.28]They are indeed, senor.
[193:59.98]The cooling system allows us to fine-tune the entire process.
[194:04.46]Temperature, humidity levels, etc.
[194:07.43]Our goal here at Pineda Yates is quite simple.
[194:10.65]From a state-of-the-art winemaking facility...
[194:20.13]How did I get her to go up?
[194:24.28]Go behind her when you shoot.
[194:25.18]She'll back away from you.
[194:27.98]Just stand still.
[194:28.96]Don't move.
[194:33.57]I kind of blocked her, right?
[194:34.61]Was I blocking her?
[194:35.35]So stand still.
[194:35.97]Okay.
[194:41.16]No.
[194:42.22]Push button?
[194:49.11]Yeah, I couldn't push her when she was standing up there.
[194:53.37]Let me try and stand over there.
[194:55.94]We're just fucking around now.
[194:57.14]The stream's pretty much over.
[194:58.04]We're just hanging out.
[195:01.10]I'm never going to get it.
[195:01.70]How did I get it again?
[195:04.49]I think if I move like over here, maybe I'll block her and she'll move up there.
[195:13.07]Save it like right here so I can reload it like a thousand times.
[195:14.95]No, it doesn't work.
[195:16.31]Got lucky and I blew it.
[195:36.50]You ruined it?
[195:37.04]I didn't move the last time I tried it.
[195:38.40]It didn't work the last time when I stood still.
[195:40.90]I didn't move the last time I reloaded it.
[195:43.76]What are you talking about?
[195:44.76]Ron's dead.
[196:09.88]They are indeed, senora.
[196:11.35]The cooling system allows us to fine-tune the entire process.
[196:15.83]Temperature, humidity levels, etc.
[196:18.51]Oh, well.
[196:18.79]Our goal here at Pineda Yates is quite simple.
[196:22.01]From the state-of-the-art winemaking facility to our carefully nurtured gravestock, hand-picked with loving care by local... What?
[196:29.92]Huh?
[196:30.30]I'm gonna add some special ingredients.
[196:33.58]Okay.
[196:33.90]I'll add some extra wine.
[196:35.92]What was that?
[196:36.47]Is that a... Hmm...
[196:40.00]A little bit of that, a little bit of, uh, a little bit of metal.
[196:45.80]Ah, yes.
[196:46.84]Our last fermentation tanks are constructed from solid French oak, and each contain up to 500 gallons of gray must.
[196:54.55]Interesting.
[196:55.87]Are those cooling sockets?
[196:58.31]They are indeed, senora.
[197:02.01]Yes, you threw that.
[197:03.69]Good for you.
[197:06.49]I think this is gonna use a little bit of spice.
[197:08.90]I'm gonna go stand up here.
[197:41.62]Okay, here we go.
[197:42.64]It's time to do the thing I wanted to do the whole time.
[197:46.34]You threw that.
[197:46.96]Good for you.
[197:47.46]Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[197:51.86]Just to let everybody know, the stream is over.
[197:55.29]I'm going to kill everybody in the room and we're going to grind everybody in the room.
[198:00.76]Just to let everybody know that's what's happening now.
[198:02.90]That's what's going on.
[198:03.60]Might as well start at the top here.
[198:06.57]Just broke her neck.
[198:07.77]I'm trying to... He shooted out of my fucking head.
[198:37.97]Alright, I've... Scratchy ass beard.
[198:42.23]That just threw me off.
[198:54.58]Get the keys under the squisher.
[198:56.82]Let me- I wanna do this- This is what I wanna do.
[198:58.92]I'm just gonna go for it.
[198:59.88]Like, fuck it.
[199:06.24]You can't kill Diana.
[199:15.61]I can knock her out.
[199:20.94]Watch Bionicle with Joe Biden.
[199:22.52]I can't.
[199:23.26]That's not possible.
[199:57.39]Get everybody in here!
[199:58.33]It just blew up the bottle?! !
[200:20.10]Okay, I'm gonna grind up everybody.
[200:21.58]I'm sorry, but... Fucking stupid game!
[200:34.02]Okay.
[200:51.04]Relax.
[200:52.70]Very cool.
[200:53.82]Hey, I love it.
[200:55.65]Come down here.
[200:58.17]Stupid, dumb, fucking, dumb, fucking idiot.
[201:00.07]Stupid, fucking, goddamn, fucking game.
[201:04.64]New strategy.
[201:10.76]Stupid, fucking, goddamn, fucking, stupid, fucking game.
[201:12.92]Fucking, goddamn, fucking idiot.
[201:20.12]Bro, it's okay to put the Catboy costume on.
[201:21.82]Here we go.
[201:35.96]This is it.
[201:36.50]This is the one.
[201:51.95]Help me.
[201:55.74]Please, help me.
[202:23.79]Okay.
[202:24.49]I can't save it.
[202:33.65]Alright.
[202:33.95]They're not in a bad spot.
[202:37.27]Ketchup factory behind the scenes?
[202:58.07]Do I have to do everybody in the whole... That was really loud.
[203:00.61]Do I have to do everybody in the level?
[203:05.05]I mean, this is... I don't know.
[203:06.53]I don't know if I should do... Everybody?
[203:08.31]Does it have to be everyone?
[203:11.08]Yes, of course.
[203:13.38]But what if I can't get every single person over?
[203:15.16]What if they start to despawn?
[203:16.14]Stop right there!
[203:24.03]Let the body go!
[203:26.19]Hey, psycho!
[203:27.90]You'll die if you don't give up the shotgun!
[203:32.38]Oh my god!
[203:35.36]Someone is firing a weapon!
[203:38.62]Move it!
[204:06.85]I'm over here.
[204:13.65]I'm over here.
[204:14.25]I thought it was a bad guy.
[204:21.36]Don't go, don't go, don't go.
[204:41.50]Put them on the ground and then activate the smasher.
[204:44.10]Holy shit, that's a way better idea.
[204:46.67]Just wait.
[204:47.01]I'm going to save it.
[204:49.21]We'll crush like 100 people in the crusher.
[204:54.35]Holy shit, what a good idea.
[204:56.71]Yeah.
[204:58.23]Yeah, that's an incredible idea.
[204:59.53]Yeah, let's go.
[205:00.87]Can I do this first?
[205:02.07]Alright, we're going to do this first.
[205:04.30]They're all already up here.
[205:07.00]Hey.
[205:10.06]Hey.
[205:19.55]Please play Pikmin.
[205:24.35]Not right now.
[205:24.97]Maybe at the time of the day.
[205:38.32]Right now.
[205:38.78]I'm not going to play it right now.
[205:39.78]I'm in the middle of doing something.
[205:42.12]How many bodies can you have on screen at once?
[205:56.91]Yeah, the 1080 is really going to start struggle here.
[206:11.24]He's got no reaction right now.
[206:12.74]I'm just trying to get this going.
[206:25.77]You need a 3080.
[206:31.26]Start doing it already.
[206:32.18]Um, hold on.
[206:33.28]We need to have patience for this.
[206:41.25]Trust me, the payoff will probably be worth it.
[206:43.19]Especially when we squish him.
[206:53.80]Telling us to have patience.
[206:55.92]Yeah.
[207:00.22]hydraulic press them okay I'm gonna save it uh I'm gonna save it here I can't even I can't save it till I'm not let me oh you okay I'm not am I still compromised searching I can't save it hold on not yet
[207:34.77]We want Pikmin.
[207:38.54]Here we go.
[207:44.06]Alright.
[207:44.56]We're going to do a small... We're going to do a small batch first and see.
[207:47.90]I just... I'm curious as to... Why does that guy have flows on?
[208:26.03]I don't think I want to do this anymore.
[208:27.33]This is like, this is just like fucked up.
[208:36.95]I don't think I want to do it.
[208:38.37]Somebody said, honey, I had a long day of grinding people up at work today.
[209:02.17]Now smush him.
[209:05.49]Okay, we're going to move over to the other thing now.
[209:14.37]Sorry, honey.
[209:14.85]The grind can be really tiresome.
[209:18.53]Crush him at once.
[209:19.49]I'm going to try that and we'll see.
[209:20.77]But we need to put at least...
[209:38.83]This is gonna take so long to get everybody into this musher.
[210:10.15]It'll be worth it.
[210:10.79]I don't... Where's the key?
[210:13.59]Forklift, please.
[210:16.74]Forklift, please.
[210:21.20]You need the key.
[210:22.00]Is it on the table?
[210:29.28]Put a laugh track on.
[210:30.46]When I smush everybody?
[210:31.70]That guy just get up?
[210:37.97]Oh, no.
[210:38.37]You...
[210:47.25]People in the other room.
[210:56.17]Is that the key?
[211:03.12]Oh, hob- no, where's it?
[211:04.24]We're on the laugh track.
[211:12.95]I... I don't know if I want to put... I don't know.
[211:15.25]It's like... This is like fucked up.
[211:17.21]I think this is too fucked up.
[211:19.63]I think this is too fucked up.
[211:22.36]This might be like too fucked up.
[211:24.58]This is fucked up.
[211:33.02]Do it.
[211:33.38]Put a laugh track on and do it.
[211:44.90]It was your idea.
[211:45.84]Yeah, it was.
[211:47.74]This was my idea.
[211:53.10]Pretend this is a Mr. Bean bit.
[211:58.62]This is Charlie Chaplin level humor.
[212:00.32]Charlie Chaplin didn't crush like 50 people in a smusher.
[212:03.44]What are you talking about?
[212:17.71]The Ritz Brothers did it.
[212:19.07]They did not smush a bunch of people.
[212:20.65]Alright, will this guy stay down?
[212:30.30]Do the Seinfeld theme.
[212:35.92]Jerry, I pressed the smusher button.
[212:39.92]What do we do?
[212:41.18]And then it just crushes them all and it's like... With like the freeze freeze.
[212:53.35]George, what are you doing, George?
[212:55.13]What are you thinking?
[212:57.45]I just, I bumped into it.
[212:59.53]I got a smoke on my cell phone.
[213:26.76]Do you want to see... And I'm the fucking... I'm the fucked up guy that's like smushing the people.
[213:31.26]But somebody wrote, leave a head outside the area so it smushes their head off.
[213:37.57]But I'm the... It's me?
[213:39.37]I'm the guy that's the crazy one?
[213:57.14]Alright.
[213:57.76]Only the people that are left in this room are going in there.
[214:03.63]That's a great idea.
[214:04.95]I'm not... No.
[214:06.45]I just... I was just curious to see if the game's engine could handle this.
[214:11.49]I'm just testing the game's engine right now.
[214:13.54]I'm not... I don't think this is cool.
[214:15.48]I'm testing the video game engine.
[214:16.70]I want to see how much particle spawns can happen.
[214:19.62]I don't... I'm serious.
[214:29.27]Isn't this a tour guide?
[214:30.17]He can go.
[215:02.08]Put him in!
[215:06.78]Smush him.
[215:10.95]I can't even look.
[215:13.47]I can't look anymore.
[215:14.55]Smush him.
[215:19.57]Oh my god.
[215:22.41]There's no mercy here.
[215:23.67]What do you mean?
[215:28.58]Put him in the juicer.
[215:29.68]I'm...
[215:43.14]Oh my God.
[215:44.68]I'm just don't look.
[215:46.60]Just don't look.
[215:47.36]Alright, I'm done.
[215:50.76]Remember, they're pixels.
[215:58.04]Smush, smush, smush, smush.
[216:01.38]And then needs to be a laugh track.
[216:02.68]Okay, I'm going to smush him.
[216:40.89]oops looks like I I accidentally pushed the button oh this is a bit of really fun why did it not do anything
[217:14.62]Why Skelet... Skeletor?
[217:15.78]Why did that autoplay?
[217:46.43]I can't... I can't alt tab and play... Just loop it.
[218:23.80]How do I loop it?
[218:26.59]How do you loop a YouTube video?
[218:32.82]Head out.
[218:34.62]Right click it.
[218:35.90]Loop.
[219:01.97]I can't... I can't turn it on when there's something in the way.
[219:04.38]It can't be an object.
[219:33.62]Wait, hold on.
[219:34.28]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[219:47.63]No, run this way.
[219:49.35]Run the other way.
[219:50.09]Run this way.
[220:00.58]I'm done with this.
[220:01.72]It's over.
[220:02.16]I'm done with this.
[220:02.98]Jerry.
[220:09.90]No.
[220:13.90]No, we squished the people.
[220:15.22]We squished the people in the wine factory.
[220:17.31]We're done.
[220:30.75]I'm not, no, no forklift.
[220:33.01]It's over.
[220:39.51]You're insane.
[220:45.07]That shit's done.
[220:47.61]That's wicked fucked up.
[220:49.43]No, we're not going to chase people around and push them into the squisher and squish their bodies with a laugh track.
[221:04.01]I want to go in by myself.
[221:15.80]Dude, no.
[221:19.54]The sooner you lose your morals, the sooner it'll be easy.
[221:22.00]No, there's... Okay.
[221:24.68]My line is... Was that Skeletor?
[221:30.20]What?
[221:30.38]Is that Skeletor?
[221:33.62]My line is smushing people.
[221:37.48]Like, look, there's being smushed.
[221:39.72]I'm not walking around and, like, forcing people into the thing, smushing them.
[221:43.09]That's, that's, no.
[221:55.18]Help them make red wine.
[221:56.88]Nice day.
[222:03.55]It's just a game, Jerma.
[222:04.93]Do it.
[222:06.49]No.
[222:07.59]No, I can't do it.
[222:08.57]No.
[222:09.19]That's too much.
[222:17.64]Absolutely smushed on red wine.
[222:22.74]Play the Seinfeld theme on loop.
[222:25.82]Go kill the Torghain.
[222:27.26]No, you monsters!
[222:32.18]These people are still filming.
[222:37.38]Put him in a smusher!
[222:40.06]Is this a rerun, though?
[222:49.79]Snap the...
[223:03.57]Hey, come look at this cool crusher that I found.
[223:05.71]Pikmin waiting room.
[223:13.77]Pikmin wa- You're still going on about that.
[223:22.56]Alright, that's it.
[223:23.40]I'm done.
[223:25.16]We- we- we did our- we did our, like, insane grind up the people, stuff as many people in the smusher as possible.
[223:34.38]And there's probably more you could do.
[223:37.01]But I, I, no.
[223:38.71]No, this is not just going to be like a mutilate bodies stream.
[223:44.47]It's fun to do for a second.
[223:47.01]But, no.
[223:49.66]No, I'm not just going to sit there and find other ways to smush more bodies.
[223:57.66]But why not?
[224:00.71]That's exactly what it's been the whole time I've played.
[224:05.06]Now there's a difference between like putting somebody in the smusher to smush them and then like grabbing as many humans as possible and smushing everybody on the level.
[224:43.03]I keep seeing forklift.
[224:46.31]Oh.
[224:53.75]Hey, that's been a lot of fun.
[224:56.94]No, I'm not forklifting anybody.
[224:58.58]No, I need to put... I can't be this corruptible.
[225:02.82]I can't be uncorruptible.
[225:04.98]I have to be uncorruptible.
[225:18.17]You have to take a stand somewhere.
[225:23.44]No, that's it.
[225:25.10]I'll see you guys.
[225:26.48]What are we doing next?
[225:27.38]I feel like there's not much... Okay, what else can I do now after I've smushed all the people?
[225:35.80]Right?
[225:44.21]In Hitman, at least.
[225:51.16]You know, how about this one?
[225:56.68]I was looking for an opportunity to play.
[225:59.86]People are going to freak out over this.
[226:03.24]Paper Mario.
[226:03.84]What do you think?
[226:05.22]Now, should I do Super Paper Mario?
[226:17.40]Thousand year door.
[226:19.52]Or regular Paper Mario.
[226:31.57]Hmm.
[226:33.37]Thousand year door.
[226:36.87]Maybe I should do a poll.
[226:38.07]What do you think?
[226:39.26]Maybe I'll poll it.
[226:48.00]Let's get a poll going.
[226:54.35]Paper Mario, which one?
[226:56.51]We'll start that in a couple days, in like two or three days.
[227:00.67]I've never played any of them, by the way.
[227:03.18]I played regular Nintendo 64 Paper Mario for like three or four hours.
[227:17.00]Or is it more than three?
[227:19.29]No, okay, well here we go.
[227:34.89]What do you think?
[227:38.71]I'm not forklifting like a hundred people, no.
[227:44.54]We've reached right at the peak of psycho stream.
[227:48.28]I don't want to cross the line into like horrible stream.
[227:53.07]We were already dancing on that line.
[227:55.01]Stop using straw poll, you fucking boomer.
[228:10.70]Why not?
[228:12.20]What's wrong with straw poll?
[228:25.26]It looks like Thousand-Year Door is winning by a very large margin.
[228:28.46]A huge margin.
[228:41.69]Is Thousand-Year Door really that much more better of a game than the first two?
[228:48.04]I know that they're kind of... You can play any one of them, right?
[229:12.30]They're all good.
[229:12.94]Okay.
[229:16.22]Alright.
[229:18.08]Emulator Earl, Omega Low.
[229:19.56]Well, I have a Wii.
[229:22.70]What was Thousand Year Door on?
[229:23.90]Was it on GameCube?
[229:24.68]It was on the GameCube.
[229:33.52]Alright.
[229:33.74]Cool.
[229:36.50]Alright.
[229:39.33]We'll do Thousand Year.
[229:40.35]We'll start Thousand Year Door.
[229:43.40]Um, on, what's today's date?
[229:48.28]We will start Thousand Year Door on Friday.
[229:53.19]That's what we're going to do.
[229:59.95]I will get a copy of it.
[230:03.13]And I'll make it work.
[230:09.23]I've been looking for an opportunity to play it too, so that's a good opportunity.
[230:21.51]When are you going to do Yakuza?
[230:22.41]That's a really good question.
[230:25.47]Soon.
[230:25.75]Take it, champ.
[230:30.46]It's all yours.
[230:31.08]You earned it.
[230:32.16]To Jerma, best streamer ever.
[230:33.66]Well, that's debatable, but thank you.
[230:40.22]Yeah, that's going to be it.
[230:40.90]I'm going to call it here.
[230:41.66]I just wanted to finish Hitman.
[230:43.69]I'll see you guys in a few days.
[230:45.11]We'll play Paper Mario Thousand Year Door.
[230:54.43]Thanks for watching, as always.
[230:56.91]Have a good rest of your night, as always.
[231:01.06]Take care of yourselves.
[231:01.78]Go relax a little, you know.
[231:04.98]You may have already been relaxing.
[231:06.10]Well, who knows?
[231:16.67]There's music.
[231:17.15]Oh.
[231:22.49]Do a raid?
[231:22.89]Yeah, we will raid today.
[231:25.19]We will raid.
[231:25.69]Let's see.
[231:34.99]Who is live at the moment?
[231:40.35]Who is currently live?
[231:41.67]Whoa.
[232:15.76]Raid yourself.
[232:18.28]No.
[232:26.78]I'll dump you guys on Joel tonight.
[232:31.62]Sure, why not?
[232:37.62]Playing madness.
[232:41.05]Madness.
[232:41.63]I'm not going to take a dump on a... I'm not going to dump pasta sauce on a pasta.
[232:51.09]That would be too much.
[232:53.01]Too much pasta sauce.
[232:58.03]You don't need that much.
[232:58.77]You just need a little bit.
[233:07.92]Center the credits.
[233:08.70]Oh, shit.
[233:09.88]Did I move it?
[233:10.36]I think I moved it.
[233:11.56]I did.
[233:15.35]Yeah, I moved it.
[233:16.35]You're right.
[233:16.87]Holy shit.
[233:17.23]How did you even pick that up?
[233:18.89]How did you pick that up?
[233:22.51]Thanks for the support, everybody.
[233:23.33]Thanks for the subs.
[233:26.47]This channel sees a lot of them.
[233:28.13]I just can't fucking believe it.
[233:29.34]Thank you.
[233:31.82]And I'll see you again in a few days.
[233:41.74]Take care of yourselves.
[233:44.06]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[233:45.94]I'll see you guys soon.
[233:46.52]See you in a few days.
[233:50.12]Good night.
[233:50.80]Goodbye.
[233:52.36]Take care.
[234:04.91]Thank you.
