[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.41]Thank you for your patience.
[00:03.53]I have returned.
[00:06.01]And it looks like, wow, there is pretty unanimous.
[00:11.44]The secret PlayStation 2 game is actually, apparently, I've never played it, but it's a really, really, really great game from what I've been told.
[00:29.09]The secret PlayStation 2 video game that we're going to play right now for a little bit is Shadow of Rome.
[00:50.55]Question marks.
[00:53.17]I didn't even know what it was.
[00:53.97]We blew it.
[01:00.98]Shadow of Rome.
[01:02.72]It's a game.
[01:08.38]Good job.
[01:09.10]Alright, hold on.
[01:10.58]Wait, wait, wait.
[01:13.99]Now that you've opened the box, do you want to re-vote with Shadow of Rome?
[01:20.59]Because I didn't know what this was until I went into the closet and looked at it.
[01:32.80]No, I'm playing it.
[01:33.80]I'm playing it.
[01:34.16]You guys picked the mystery box.
[01:35.90]You can't... 70% of you opened up the fucking crate.
[01:40.66]And, sorry.
[01:43.39]Sorry, you didn't get a knife this time.
[01:46.47]Or whatever it is people look for now.
[01:53.29]That was Guitaro, man.
[01:57.18]That was very, very fun.
[01:58.42]A little, like, two plus hour, little fun game.
[02:02.05]I'm gonna try Shadow of Rome now.
[02:03.69]Apparently, people are already talking shit that I don't know if you should be.
[02:12.39]We're gonna play Um, Jammer Lambie.
[02:14.73]Regardless.
[02:16.73]We're gonna play Um, Jammer Lambie regardless of if that shows up now.
[02:21.16]We're also gonna play both the Parappa games.
[02:26.34]But who knows?
[02:27.54]This could be a very, very, very big deal game.
[02:31.61]I feel like a lot of people might actually really like this.
[02:34.89]I don't know.
[02:40.10]This is not the original Guitar-O-Man anymore.
[02:42.20]This is... Create a save file.
[02:48.36]Okay, we'll see.
[02:49.50]If in the first... We'll give it 30 minutes.
[02:51.90]If in 30 minutes we can reliably say, this game sucks, okay?
[02:58.65]Then this game contains scenes of violence, okay?
[03:06.75]This is a strategy game.
[03:09.94]It's a top-down RTS game.
[03:10.72]You guys still interested?
[03:33.11]It's not, okay?
[03:33.91]I don't want people to just take off because I just said that.
[03:40.77]No, this game's gonna be fucking good.
[03:44.88]Pretty good graphics for the PlayStation 2.
[03:59.38]Uh, Shadow of Rome.
[04:00.48]Getting the Colosseum.
[04:03.76]Oh!
[04:03.98]Oh!
[04:04.10]Oh!
[04:04.22]Oh!
[04:24.90]I spelled Colosseum so incorrectly here that it can't even... There's no autocorrect to help me.
[04:52.56]Colosseum.
[04:53.98]Colosseum.
[04:54.42]But it was not to last.
[04:56.68]Despite her citizens' wishes, Rome was once again sucked into the vortex of violence and destruction.
[05:03.75]Yeah, it's Colosseum.
[05:14.56]Colosseum War.
[05:16.66]What a shitty title.
[05:20.71]Coliseum War.
[05:21.51]That's a great iPad, like, iPhone game.
[05:25.76]Alright, I'm keeping it.
[05:26.60]Okay.
[05:44.65]Imagine you have to keep the analog in a thing and it's a rhythm game.
[05:48.40]Did I get killed?
[05:50.54]No, wait a minute!
[05:51.98]Oh, spoilers, by the way.
[05:53.46]If you don't know about, uh, this is a huge spoiler.
[05:56.04]I just, I know if you're looking at this in history class, Caesar gets stabbed.
[06:02.21]Uh, it's a huge part of, like, the, the, the last, uh, season.
[06:07.11]He's, that's the line, yo.
[06:11.25]I'm sorry if you, I just spoiled, like, history 101 for you.
[06:16.00]Now you're going to be pissed because now you know how it ends.
[06:20.07]What do we get for options?
[06:22.89]Violence.
[06:24.23]Violence on.
[06:25.07]What do you mean?
[06:25.81]Violence off.
[06:28.86]Player cannot cut enemies into pieces.
[06:32.78]Green blood?
[06:36.14]Why green blood?
[06:38.55]Like, I don't want to keep green blood on.
[06:40.37]They're all, like, aliens?
[06:46.36]Okay, I want to keep that on.
[06:49.96]Uh, subtitles on.
[06:51.48]That's fine.
[06:53.98]Screen.
[06:55.45]That's fine.
[07:11.76]I thought about it.
[07:18.22]But this is like 2001 hard.
[07:21.76]It's different.
[07:22.38]It's not like 2020 hard.
[07:23.96]This game is insanely hard.
[07:30.38]What was I thinking?
[07:48.99]Do I get to choose my weapon?
[07:49.95]Which one of these guys is me?
[07:53.22]Opening, opening, opening.
[07:58.46]This is a really long intro.
[08:21.68]What's this guy's name?
[08:24.33]Kratos?
[08:27.19]Something like that, right?
[08:37.82]I'll explain today's event.
[08:40.36]First mess.
[08:40.92]Three potentially lethal rooms await you.
[08:44.20]The first room is set up Battle Royale style.
[08:48.18]You must defeat all your opponents to proceed to the next room.
[08:50.68]There are few weapons fighted out for them.
[08:54.19]In the second room is a guard.
[08:55.49]He's carrying a weapon, so don't let your guard down.
[08:58.91]In the last room, you'll just have to find out what awaits you there.
[09:06.35]Okay.
[09:08.49]So you move with left analog, move camera right analog.
[09:10.79]Press R3 to center the camera.
[09:12.31]Good to know.
[09:13.22]Press circle button when the talk icon is displayed.
[09:15.56]You can also listen to the conversations of others this way.
[09:17.52]So circle is talk and listen.
[09:20.40]Did I just, was there a down?
[09:26.37]Three rooms, eh?
[09:27.13]This won't be easy.
[09:34.48]What is salvo list?
[09:38.16]Memo.
[09:39.50]Defeat the enemies.
[09:40.28]Alright, well, let's just go.
[09:43.79]Go to the first room.
[09:46.83]How do I leave?
[09:47.37]Can I leave?
[09:50.89]Did you catch all that?
[09:52.83]No, explain it again.
[09:55.78]Yep, three rooms.
[09:57.20]Yes, yes.
[10:04.18]I wanted to see if I could go down.
[10:05.44]I understand.
[10:05.98]Let's let me out.
[10:08.21]Talk to the masked man by the gate.
[10:09.69]Can you buy stuff?
[10:13.69]New recruits enter the arena unarmed.
[10:15.13]Pick up weapons to defend yourself.
[10:16.71]If you want to enter with weapons, prove your worth by finishing by winning a few times, okay?
[10:23.94]Are you ready to enter the arena?
[10:25.14]Yes.
[10:27.04]Give the audience a match to remember.
[10:33.14]Please upgrade the resolution.
[10:35.60]I can't do that.
[10:36.84]That doesn't exist.
[10:37.78]This is 20 years ago.
[10:41.42]Press the circle button near the desired weapon to pick it up.
[10:46.47]Okay, why is that guy so huge?
[10:49.25]Hold R1 to lock onto an enemy.
[10:52.89]And main attack is X, sub attack is square.
[11:03.43]Get the big guy first!
[11:10.31]He's got green blood!
[11:13.89]He's a fucking science experiment!
[11:19.78]No, work together!
[11:20.58]Your weapon will break once its durability reaches zero.
[11:23.42]Be sure to watch your durability gauge to make sure you aren't left fighting without a weapon.
[11:28.14]Okay.
[11:30.10]Where's the durability gauge?
[11:31.06]Oh, there it is.
[11:33.57]Ow.
[11:34.11]Is there a dodge?
[11:34.71]Is there like a dodge roll?
[11:41.42]Shoulder ram.
[11:43.06]When unarmed, press the X button while stepping forward to ram the enemy.
[11:47.82]If you're lucky, he may just lose his grip on his weapon.
[11:50.60]Shoulder ram.
[11:52.89]Okay, that's a shoulder ram.
[12:03.09]No, give me that weapon.
[12:06.11]Get the f- Why would you bounce off of somebody?
[12:26.06]Step on his head!
[12:27.76]Threat from above.
[12:31.08]What?
[12:32.14]What do you mean, threat from above?
[12:34.06]I want the weapon.
[12:34.60]Give me the guy with the weapon.
[12:40.20]Give me the... Give me the weapon!
[12:44.58]Oh, that guy has it.
[12:49.92]Steal the enemy's weapon.
[12:51.08]Sometimes you will end up grabbing hold of the enemy's weapon after you shoulder ram.
[12:55.35]At that time, repeatedly press X or square to pry the weapon from their hands.
[13:01.46]I'll get it every time.
[13:02.24]Alright, that guy's dead.
[13:08.90]Okay.
[13:10.08]Got him.
[13:11.12]Now... Is there any other weapons?
[13:13.21]Ooh.
[13:19.25]Domino effect.
[13:19.95]Is this thing already broken?
[13:23.85]Kill him.
[13:25.65]Get attention from the audience.
[13:28.19]Appeal to the spectators by pressing square and X buttons at the same time.
[13:32.10]Time it right, and you may just get your hands on a weapon.
[13:35.74]The more pleased the audience is with your performance, the better your chance of having them throw out a powerful weapon.
[13:44.16]Give me something.
[13:45.22]Holy shit, that's big.
[13:46.52]Anything else?
[13:48.38]I'll take the Grand Halberd.
[13:56.18]What did I do?
[13:58.24]You can see he's using his arm.
[14:03.54]He picked up the guy's arm.
[14:07.57]Holy shit.
[14:10.05]Give me another weapon!
[14:13.13]Cheese!
[14:16.77]While holding meat, cheese, bread, etc.
[14:20.27]Press the square button to eat and restore some health.
[14:23.61]Tap square to eat faster.
[14:28.65]It's like fucking Minecraft.
[14:29.96]Alright, let's go.
[14:30.76]Who's left?
[14:33.28]Alright, next room.
[14:44.43]How long do I get to keep the halberd for?
[14:49.15]Oh, there's a garden here, right?
[14:51.15]It's not a landmine, is it?
[14:54.25]Called L1 to Guard.
[14:56.61]No, are you serious?
[14:58.33]No.
[14:59.81]I'm gonna cut this guy in half.
[15:13.19]End him!
[15:17.91]We're just way throughout.
[15:20.09]Bow?
[15:20.77]Give me the bow.
[15:21.86]Oh, fuck, there's people here.
[15:26.78]How do you fire the bow?
[15:40.85]Um... What else dropped?
[15:46.13]Can I pick this guy up and, like, throw him?
[15:49.81]I need a dodge roll.
[15:50.55]Bad.
[15:52.37]I got a ram.
[15:52.83]Alright, come here.
[15:54.99]Come here.
[16:01.62]No, no, no, no, no.
[16:02.55]Where's dodge?
[16:03.11]What's dodge roll?
[16:04.27]I know it exists.
[16:08.91]Kill him.
[16:09.37]Stab him.
[16:10.27]You have a knife in your hand.
[16:11.55]Stab him.
[16:26.86]Fuck.
[16:33.05]Can you throw?
[16:36.29]Give me something.
[16:42.33]What'd he break?
[16:43.49]Oh shit, I have no weapon, no.
[16:48.98]This guy back here.
[16:49.76]He's like having trouble.
[16:50.48]What do I do?
[16:52.60]Give me that.
[16:57.72]No, this guy over here.
[17:00.83]Are you serious?
[17:02.25]I'm gonna get fucking embarrassed by this tired guy with the shield.
[17:05.09]Really?
[17:17.72]Don't even think about it.
[17:23.67]No, no, no, no!
[17:24.93]Pick up the... I need that shield.
[17:31.52]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[17:32.68]How did that not hit you?
[17:34.66]Pick it up!
[17:48.48]Oh my god.
[17:58.24]Kill him.
[17:59.25]What's wrong with my head?
[18:07.19]Kill him!
[18:07.97]Why?
[18:09.51]Kill him!
[18:20.64]He's dead.
[18:22.18]Jeez.
[18:22.36]Give me the new mace.
[18:28.18]I have to crawl through a hole?
[18:33.65]Where's the last door?
[18:38.23]What happens if I lose here?
[18:41.02]The common criminal is cowards who haven't resolved to fight.
[18:45.52]I hereby order the execution of these dogs.
[18:47.68]Let the crowds be pleased by their grisly demise.
[18:52.20]Hold the X button down for a short while and you'll perform a powerful attack.
[19:11.40]It's her cheese.
[19:45.68]No, I don't want to kill these guys.
[19:52.15]Where's my choice?
[20:06.08]He's dodged.
[20:08.54]And actually, it's just, where are you guys getting these from?
[20:13.15]How do you throw that from there?
[20:16.81]How do you, this thing has to be like 200 pounds.
[20:19.05]Oh, you have another maul.
[20:53.89]That's not... Alright, give me something faster than this.
[21:01.38]Hold on.
[21:01.60]Give me this thing.
[21:02.08]No!
[21:02.24]Please don't kill me!
[21:19.96]Urine trouble?
[21:22.26]Hold on, I cut that guy's head off and he peed out of his head?
[21:25.12]Uh-oh.
[21:32.45]Jeez, give me it.
[21:38.51]I want more cheese.
[21:48.09]Watch out!
[21:51.23]Okay.
[21:51.97]Just little hits.
[21:53.74]Small ones.
[21:57.26]Oh, fuck!
[22:03.18]Stab him!
[22:04.34]Stab him through the face!
[22:05.40]Stab him!
[22:06.76]Really?
[22:15.69]Stab him!
[22:17.27]Wait, what did it break?
[22:21.31]Anybody got another one of those?
[22:26.84]Uh oh.
[22:35.20]Get him down.
[22:37.10]Oh shit.
[22:41.50]Oh fuck, he almost...
[22:44.86]Why does this keep breaking?
[22:46.41]Everybody loves me.
[23:01.46]The crowd loves me.
[23:08.81]Wait, don't I have to, like, execute the... Doesn't Caesar... Oh.
[23:13.21]Yeah.
[23:13.81]I was gonna say, doesn't Caesar put his hand up or hand... Thumbs down, thumbs up?
[23:28.98]Please.
[23:36.45]I refuse to end my days in this place.
[23:39.59]Not like that.
[23:49.67]Not like this.
[23:50.19]Is it Chris Redfield?
[23:59.85]No.
[24:00.81]It's... I don't know.
[24:07.30]Chapter 1, The Wickedness of Men.
[24:10.09]Marvelous madness has invaded not only the wicked, but even those who are held to be good.
[24:17.34]Change blood.
[24:19.24]Red blood.
[24:19.80]Why would I do that?
[24:35.29]We want violence.
[24:36.43]You're getting violence.
[24:41.32]I thought this was a coliseum game.
[25:00.27]This better not be a sneak around game.
[25:03.46]Don't do the few days earlier thing and have me sneak around.
[25:21.78]They have been here as well.
[25:24.44]Centurion Agrippa.
[25:31.55]There is no doubt of it.
[25:34.15]It is certain that it belonged to a Roman messenger, sir.
[25:36.76]The guitar man was fine, wasn't he?
[25:40.28]They have been captured.
[25:41.44]It has not been long since they left.
[25:52.21]We shall separate and look for them.
[25:55.34]Yes, sir!
[26:06.78]Do I play as the wolf?
[26:17.85]Rome has embarked on a campaign to the Germanic territories in the north, endeavoring to fully secure its realm.
[26:24.16]During the battle, a group of Roman messengers disappeared suddenly while in enemy territory.
[26:29.09]In order to prevent the spread of confidential information, reconnaissance troops have been dispatched to the forest of Germania.
[26:46.91]Wait, this is... Press select button to bring up the map screen.
[26:56.42]Player, enemy, ally.
[26:58.42]Target, item, weapon.
[27:01.58]Okay, well, I'm... No, there's no friendly fire.
[27:09.41]I've been to many land and weathered my share of harsh climes, but I must say that this place may well be the worst.
[27:17.55]Alright, well, I'm gonna go over here, in this tent.
[27:20.10]Because there's a weapon in here.
[27:28.99]I don't know what was in there.
[27:30.41]But it's not there anymore.
[27:36.43]He's having a tantrum.
[27:39.84]Okay, well, what's this item, then?
[27:43.35]Change blood, change blood.
[27:45.31]I'm not gonna change the blood.
[27:47.59]No.
[27:48.75]This is a PG-13 stream.
[27:56.71]Something in there?
[27:59.36]Alright, let's just- I'm just gonna go this way.
[28:05.02]No, I don't want to get in- I don't want to get in trouble.
[28:15.65]If my mom comes in in this red blood, she's going to be very concerned.
[28:20.31]And I'm going to have to explain.
[28:29.24]Please call me if you need anything.
[28:30.34]What is it?
[28:31.40]Tell the men it's time to mobilize.
[28:32.80]Should I have done that?
[28:40.85]That is enough.
[28:42.15]Let us move forth.
[28:47.98]Alright, here we go.
[28:52.43]Alright, what happens if I turn into red and then turn into green after one hit?
[29:03.94]Supra attack.
[29:04.72]Press the X button while holding R1 and pressing the left analog stick forward.
[29:09.02]Press X while holding R1 and pressing the left analog backwards.
[29:24.46]My mom's gonna fucking kill me.
[29:36.14]How did I do that dodge roll?
[29:44.61]Supra!
[29:47.19]Give me that.
[29:55.17]Kick?
[29:55.75]Does kick get rid of the shield?
[29:58.54]Oh fuck, that guy just got destroyed.
[29:59.84]That guy moved pretty high.
[30:03.94]Red blood is uninspired.
[30:04.58]I want to go back to the arena.
[30:31.41]Thank you.
[30:31.75]I was going to say, that would have been terrible.
[30:39.63]We must hurry.
[30:43.26]The cremation of the assassinated Julius Caesar took place in the Foro Romano.
[30:49.95]As the raging flames reduced Rome's former ruler to ashes, all who looked on were struck by the poignancy of his own too early demise.
[30:59.76]Is this the Powerpuff Girls guy?
[31:03.00]Sugar!
[31:03.74]Spice!
[31:04.60]Hear me, my fellow Romans!
[31:08.60]And here comes Cicero, champion of the Senate.
[31:13.31]We, the members of the Senate, have found the man responsible... Does he have a baby bottle?
[31:18.27]Why is he drinking out of a baby bottle?
[31:20.73]Furious Caesar.
[31:29.41]It is the traitor of Rome.
[31:31.23]I mean, he kind of looks like a baby, I guess.
[31:32.61]Lipsonius.
[31:33.75]Lipsonius?
[31:35.57]That is Agrippa's father.
[31:37.36]It cannot be.
[31:39.70]It is not true.
[31:42.79]It's going to be me this does the Maggie I
[32:12.74]Oh.
[32:12.82]Is that him?
[32:13.34]Yeah, how much money does that- how much money does that skin cost?
[32:25.98]Fucking 600 gems?
[32:41.74]Look at that fucking, look at that like fucking... I just, I don't get the cape.
[32:48.88]It's bullshit.
[32:50.08]It's not fair.
[32:57.92]That was a really, that really divided chat.
[33:02.30]Constant fucking conflict.
[33:04.84]I didn't, somebody read it, I didn't.
[33:10.70]Phipsanius, a murderer, there's got to be more to this story.
[33:18.28]Rome will never know a hero like Caesar.
[33:27.52]What's that?
[33:27.90]You're concerned about that wretched criminal.
[33:29.68]Are you a friend of that traitor?
[33:30.78]Here comes lore.
[33:39.47]Caesar may have charmed with his elegance, but no one can ignore Antonius' youthful grace.
[33:51.44]Antonius was the most capable of Caesar's advisors.
[33:53.50]Surely no one will find... Alright, well... What do we want to do?
[34:03.75]He loved Caesar.
[34:04.59]He held him in the highest regard.
[34:07.11]Could he have faked his admiration and loyalty?
[34:13.02]The Senate House is but a stone's throw away.
[34:16.14]It's only a moment's journey by foot.
[34:17.52]That said, I fear the real challenge will be found in gaining entry.
[34:23.65]The Senate House.
[34:25.99]Yes, leave.
[34:35.77]This game is not what I thought it was going to be.
[34:37.61]This actually is like a strategy game.
[34:45.17]I don't even know who the fuck I am.
[34:46.03]Man, this is bullshit.
[34:50.25]I get to play the first... 22 minutes as Snake, and now I get to be riding for the rest of the game?
[34:56.13]Don't do this shit.
[35:01.73]Apparently, Caesar hated having security guards think it would end like this.
[35:08.04]It's been successful in the- Alright, we'll just- I mean, pretty cool, interesting lore here, but... I mean, I gotta get in the Senate House.
[35:17.89]Yes, hi.
[35:24.36]Here we go.
[35:30.58]What?
[35:34.16]That's not... That's a quick way to die.
[35:43.27]This is not a child's playground.
[35:48.17]He's got a Rolex?
[35:49.09]What is on his arm?
[35:49.99]He's got like a fucking nice watch.
[35:51.51]Oh, that's her.
[35:52.29]Octavianus.
[36:15.22]Vipsanius had Caesar's blood on his hands.
[36:19.82]We shall know more tomorrow, after the Senate meeting.
[36:23.26]Go home now.
[36:30.05]Please watch Rome on HBO.
[36:31.89]It's very good.
[36:32.59]Alright.
[36:34.61]Ad.
[36:34.73]What do you mean, ad?
[36:40.73]I just read that.
[36:43.07]Why would Agrippa's father slay Caesar?
[36:46.83]I must speak to the Senate.
[36:48.68]This must be a misunderstanding.
[36:51.74]What troubled you, young man?
[36:53.10]No, just give me like a spear.
[36:54.46]It's Obi-Wan.
[36:59.66]Who are you?
[37:05.86]Have you forgotten Old Panza, good Octavianus?
[37:17.71]People still name, like, Octavianus and, like... Aspiranius or whatever?
[37:23.11]No?
[37:30.68]How did we get from there to, like... Dan.
[37:38.28]Oh, Octavianus.
[37:40.00]Steve.
[37:50.46]Hold L2 and- oh it is- what is this?
[37:56.12]L2 is sneak.
[37:58.80]Oh fuck sneaking.
[38:06.30]I missed the stab.
[38:11.25]Holy shit he just did the backstab to me.
[38:14.25]He got behind me.
[38:22.63]Listen to that.
[38:25.66]Right there.
[38:31.14]Got it.
[38:31.84]Give me that.
[38:35.32]Can't fall off.
[38:35.86]There's no joke there.
[38:36.58]Sorry, guys.
[38:39.40]Steve is short for Stevious.
[38:43.34]No, it is not.
[38:50.23]We've got a long way to go.
[39:00.44]I think we just started taking off the Eos off of our names.
[39:04.94]Like, you know, like Jeremiah Eos.
[39:08.33]And then it went to Jeremiah.
[39:09.85]And then it went to Jeremy.
[39:14.79]That is true.
[39:22.06]You can throw in this game.
[39:23.20]One full letter grade.
[39:24.14]Press triangle while holding weapon to throw it straight ahead.
[39:32.06]Did I get him?
[39:33.40]I didn't even see what happened.
[39:34.54]Did I... Where'd I hit him?
[39:43.53]Cut this tree down.
[39:45.91]You actually do cut the tree down.
[39:47.05]That's pretty cool, actually.
[39:54.58]That doesn't go... Did he just...
[39:58.82]Guys, there's a guy here, you know?
[40:01.70]Nice work.
[40:02.82]Give me... I want that.
[40:09.25]I want his torch.
[40:14.65]What just happened?
[40:15.89]He just spit in our face?
[40:18.98]There we go.
[40:19.36]Give me the torch.
[40:30.38]Get sand.
[40:36.46]Alright, we're reaching about the 30 minute mark.
[40:43.63]It's almost there.
[40:44.51]Ow!
[40:57.32]It's fun.
[40:58.91]It's fun.
[40:59.97]But it's just... I don't think it's 2019 fun.
[41:15.55]Like, back like 20 years ago, this was probably the best game that ever came out.
[41:18.47]Like, for the year.
[41:37.93]What's my favorite game of all time?
[41:43.45]That's too much of a loaded question.
[41:53.74]I looked at chat, I looked over here, and I thought there was an arrow in my head.
[41:59.48]How is it loaded?
[42:00.04]Because I can't answer it.
[42:03.27]First person view.
[42:04.29]Look at this.
[42:04.64]It's got first person mode.
[42:06.80]Press R to FPV mode.
[42:09.52]FPV.
[42:11.90]Just look at how old this is.
[42:12.94]They couldn't even do... FPS?
[42:14.80]First person?
[42:16.98]FPV?
[42:27.88]You can zoom in and zoom out.
[42:30.14]Alright, so throw.
[42:39.97]Can you see me?
[42:43.13]Is he shooting arrows?
[42:44.01]I don't think so.
[42:51.67]Hello?
[42:52.99]What was that?
[42:57.05]Throw it back.
[42:57.77]Quick, do something funny.
[43:00.33]I'm just kind of...
[43:10.30]I was trying to throw a rock at this guy.
[43:12.16]Was that, like, funny?
[43:17.46]The rocks are all broken now.
[43:22.00]Just... Get out of the... Why are you standing in the way?
[43:24.73]These guys... These NPCs don't do anything.
[43:27.99]They just get in the way.
[43:35.43]No, this way.
[43:39.27]There you go, fuck off.
[43:44.24]Alright, now burn him!
[43:48.16]I can't- I can't even see.
[43:56.99]The sequel to this game became Dead Rising halfway through development.
[44:03.47]Are you serious?
[44:10.87]That's kind of awesome.
[44:11.99]That's ridiculous.
[44:19.95]Yeah, the way you throw shit too.
[44:21.32]Let's just play Dead Rising.
[44:31.14]Because this game did so poorly, they changed the game mid-development.
[44:35.42]Are you kidding me?
[44:37.11]No way.
[44:43.75]Okay, I... Maybe I will play Dead Rising.
[44:49.37]I played Dead Rising, like, three.
[44:51.75]Um, there's, like, fifteen people here.
[44:55.76]I was supposed to sneak, I think.
[44:56.90]Just go in the door.
[45:01.80]The door's locked.
[45:05.75]Well, that's fucking horrible.
[45:07.35]I'm dead.
[45:12.31]Didn't I have two friends?
[45:13.39]Are they dead?
[45:23.28]This is it!
[45:35.61]Don't lock on, just hit.
[45:43.04]Oh, fuck.
[45:43.40]He's going around me.
[45:46.51]Give me that.
[45:49.75]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[45:50.81]Don't die.
[45:51.17]Alright.
[45:58.13]I was trying to... Wait.
[46:00.55]Can... Is someone going to throw me cheese?
[46:02.84]From where?
[46:03.38]All the way back?
[46:04.34]Like, in three years?
[46:07.66]Hold on.
[46:07.92]So someone's in three years in the future is going to throw me cheese from behind the rock.
[46:23.69]Die.
[46:26.85]Die.
[46:28.42]Die before I play Unjammer Lammy.
[46:33.68]Secret PlayStation 2 game that I forgot I had.
[46:37.46]It's pretty good.
[46:40.89]It's pretty good.
[46:54.90]Nice Resident Evil death stream.
[46:58.31]Time to bring in Lambie.
[47:00.23]I think it's time to bring in Lambie.
[47:01.57]I think so.
[47:04.53]And, well, here's the... Hold on a minute here.
[47:06.19]This is important.
[47:07.66]Oh, this, like, sucked.
[47:09.02]No, no, no.
[47:09.92]Because this confirmed that I was going to play Dead Rising 1.
[47:13.60]If I didn't do this, we would not have come to the conclusion that I was going to play Dead Rising 1 on stream.
[47:20.83]You understand?
[47:21.29]Like, how things... This, like, cause and effect...
[47:24.88]It was worth doing this.
[47:31.71]Imagine, yeah, imagine the timeline that would have, I would have never, would have probably played Dead Rising 1 on stream.
[47:37.37]It was worth doing.
[47:38.27]Absolutely.
[47:42.44]Now let's play I'm Jamer Lamey.
[47:44.58]Pretty good secret stream.
[47:45.90]I don't even know, where is I'm Jamer Lamey?
[47:59.32]Oh, fuck, that's right.
[48:01.27]Um, it's not here yet.
[48:02.61]It's being delivered, like, tomorrow.
[48:04.95]Just kidding.
[48:05.59]Relax.
[48:08.41]So, hold on.
[48:08.91]So, are you telling me the PlayStation 2 can do this?
[48:14.24]Are you sure?
[48:14.64]I have, like, the PlayStation 2 baby.
[48:18.26]I don't have, like, the big one.
[48:21.85]Can the little baby PlayStation 2 do it?
