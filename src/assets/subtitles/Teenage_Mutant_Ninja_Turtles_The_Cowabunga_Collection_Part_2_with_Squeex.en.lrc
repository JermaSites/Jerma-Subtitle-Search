[01:06.63]Hello, everybody.
[01:07.70]Hi, now they can hear us.
[01:10.02]I've been told to call you Big J. Is this something that you're changing?
[01:14.95]You're rebranding a little bit?
[01:17.51]Not necessarily.
[01:18.42]You can call me.
[01:18.96]I mean, that's fine.
[01:21.80]You know what?
[01:22.16]I'm going to own it.
[01:23.39]I'm owning it.
[01:24.11]I am Big J. I got really angry.
[01:27.92]well that that's gonna sound like you're like the Joker I feel like that I'm like Harley Quinn no no don't ever call you don't ever call yourself the Joker ever I I called you the Joker wait what's wrong with being the Joker okay people that say they're the Joker they're actually the penguin people that say they're the Riddler are actually the Joker if somebody says they're the penguin believe them
[01:52.22]Wait, okay.
[01:53.34]But I feel like I identify as the Riddler.
[01:56.44]So you're saying I'm Joker, really?
[01:57.68]You're the Joker, yeah.
[01:58.95]That's what people say.
[01:59.73]No, I'm the Riddler.
[02:00.31]You're actually the Joker.
[02:02.35]No, I'm not.
[02:04.17]Yeah.
[02:04.29]Wait, then what do you identify as?
[02:08.16]Robin.
[02:10.54]Okay, then if you identify as Robin, are you really Batman or something?
[02:15.83]Maybe.
[02:16.03]Maybe.
[02:16.84]Also, I've never heard anyone call themselves Robin.
[02:19.50]Usually Robin is like a huge insult.
[02:22.88]I can't believe self-proclaimed Robin.
[02:24.93]Hey, Robin becomes Nightwing.
[02:27.57]Don't forget that.
[02:29.33]Yeah, but he's Robin.
[02:30.45]I don't know.
[02:31.53]I mean, he's just, I just feel like he's like, you know, little bro.
[02:37.78]You don't want to be a, you want to be your Batman.
[02:40.88]So little bro grows up to be big bro.
[02:43.85]Yeah, but it takes so long.
[02:45.41]Like, in popular media, little bro is always little bro.
[02:48.36]It takes a perfectly normal amount of human years.
[02:51.44]Can I actually diagnose you as someone?
[02:54.40]I think you're Alfred.
[02:55.92]Go ahead.
[02:56.20]No way.
[02:56.44]I'm not Alfred.
[02:57.07]Come on.
[02:58.07]No, Alfred's too reliable.
[03:00.33]You're saying you're not reliable?
[03:01.55]We both showed up on time.
[03:02.99]Incredibly unreliable.
[03:05.95]That's such an Alfred thing to say, to identify yourself as unreliable.
[03:09.78]Unreliable, Mr. Wayne.
[03:11.96]You just said that.
[03:13.10]Alright, but...
[03:14.33]I'm wicked unreliable but when I do show up I show a huge you know what I mean yeah that's alfred you got the freaking you're gonna take Batman down to the bat cave and show him off some new technology I'm sorry that's alfred yeah but okay what if it took okay what if Batman was like alfred we're scheduled for you to show me the new tech and uh oh 600 hours
[03:38.06]And he's like, oh, absolutely, Mr. White.
[03:40.22]I will be there at exactly $600, Mr. White.
[03:43.14]And then he just doesn't show up.
[03:43.98]He shows up like three days later.
[03:45.91]Batman's going to be pissed.
[03:47.85]You're right.
[03:48.13]And this is when Batman was played by the lead singer of Green Day, right?
[03:51.85]That's that voice.
[03:55.00]I forgot.
[03:55.56]I must have missed that one.
[03:57.38]How the heck are you?
[03:59.12]I'm doing so great, Jeremy.
[04:00.68]I went on my walk this morning.
[04:02.20]I checked out a new coffee spot and I had an avocado toast.
[04:05.61]New coffee?
[04:07.17]new coffee are you still on caffeine free uh slightly I I do one small cup of coffee in the morning though oh but it is caffeine it is caffeine I was doing I was yeah I was doing fold complete all decaf no caffeine for like two or three weeks almost like a month it was good that's brutal but then why'd you go back
[04:28.85]Um, I had a lot of shit to get kind of done.
[04:31.85]And I was just like, I got, I, I have to get some shit done.
[04:34.92]So I went back to content with life when you're caffeine free.
[04:39.16]You're like, alright, come on.
[04:39.92]I need some drive here.
[04:40.84]I got to get some shit done.
[04:41.93]Yeah.
[04:43.51]That's how I feel.
[04:44.31]I used to, when I, uh, when I worked, I used to have like five cups of coffee a day.
[04:49.38]I was like shaking every day.
[04:51.48]Uh, and that's like when I got a cut back on most streams, dude, coffee was just flowing here.
[04:58.80]It was just so easy to be like, oh, I'll be right back.
[05:00.91]I'm going to get another coffee.
[05:02.61]You know, you're talking, you're, you're trying to play a game.
[05:05.83]And after like the third or fourth BRB.
[05:09.68]You take a break every hour.
[05:11.38]So like the coffee is right there.
[05:12.98]You're just tempting yourself.
[05:14.32]I know.
[05:14.58]I get it.
[05:14.92]You're stretching your legs.
[05:15.82]You're like, you know what?
[05:16.50]Maybe I'll have coffee.
[05:17.90]Maybe I'll have a cigarette.
[05:18.99]I mean, I don't know what you do.
[05:20.79]Coffee and cigarette that night.
[05:22.85]I don't know.
[05:25.07]Oh, it's too long.
[05:25.71]You only have time for coffee.
[05:27.46]I don't think I could... Okay, I don't smoke cigarettes.
[05:30.58]But if I were to smoke cigarettes, I don't think I'd be able to do it.
[05:35.23]What do you mean?
[05:35.89]Have you ever played Minecraft?
[05:38.05]Oh, yeah.
[05:38.53]I see you've played Minecraft.
[05:40.30]Yeah, I mean, listen, when you play Minecraft, you all of a sudden realize why people smoke cigarettes.
[05:44.44]It just makes sense in your brain.
[05:46.34]Coffee and a cigarette.
[05:47.47]Trust me.
[05:48.03]Trust me on this.
[05:48.65]Yeah, but doesn't it take like five to ten minutes to smoke a cigarette?
[05:52.97]I mean, no.
[05:53.93]I think you can... It just depends on how long you inhale.
[05:58.41]what you're saying you're gonna do a one drag I'm a speed runner uh I mean you never know like I think we can start a really new a good new category alright don't smoke smoke it's not good for you smoke it's bad for you okay no don't smoke for sure I mean that's terrible I don't smoke do you smoke
[06:18.23]no no I mean no no I've smoked a cigarette before what I'm sorry do we have to cancel this I'm sorry no you have you've smoked a cigarette before in your whole life one cigarette yes in college oh my god it was I'm sorry I know I you know what I I I fucked up
[06:43.41]Alright, so Squeaks, today we're going to be playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for Turtles in Time for the Super Nintendo.
[06:50.22]Very, very cool today because if we lose, if we don't beat the game today, then Squeaks is going to eat a ghost pepper.
[06:57.52]So that is a crazy thing that he put up there a couple days ago.
[07:03.58]that's oh yeah wait no you're right I have a ghost pepper and then you do the uh what is it the um hot ones atomic bomb pepper challenge right the hot wait what so what's it called the bomb the hot ones the bomb oh is it hot drink I mean it's called the bomb Jerma it's not like yeah but it could be it could be mild and they're just trying to like feel like look at how crazy we are but it's like jalapeño mild
[07:31.99]Yeah, but no, no, no.
[07:33.32]It looks hot, but I'm not sure.
[07:34.70]You're right.
[07:35.36]Maybe they're playing it up for the cameras.
[07:37.84]Okay, so you're going to try it.
[07:38.88]You're going to see if it's true or not, if we can't beat the game.
[07:41.83]I have a very sad confession to make to everybody, and it's very sad.
[07:47.56]I don't think I can eat anything hotter than mild jalapeños for the rest of my entire life.
[07:57.14]Yeah, not with that attitude, Jerma.
[07:58.76]Yeah, dude, I used to love hot sauce.
[08:01.25]I used to love anything.
[08:02.39]Oh, yeah, I'll take a spice level three.
[08:04.55]Are you kidding me?
[08:05.77]What the fuck are you talking about?
[08:07.20]Oh, you know, I'll take a spice level one out of ten.
[08:09.80]Oh, my God, just do zero, zero.
[08:11.50]I'll take a three.
[08:13.27]Boom.
[08:15.61]Yeah, but do you ever feel like there's pressure to not take...
[08:19.75]Imagine you're having Indian food and you're at a restaurant.
[08:23.30]Don't you feel pressure because the person who's taking your order is going to be like, oh, do you want the baby little silly version of chicken?
[08:32.76]Or do you want the real?
[08:35.18]They'll point to you and be like, I know you want the spicy thing.
[08:38.37]You
[08:38.45]You can't be like, no, ma'am.
[08:40.13]You know, it's embarrassing.
[08:41.41]I would say, give me the zero and you can make fun of me as much as you want.
[08:45.16]I'll even do it.
[08:45.74]You can just videotape me, you making fun of me and I'll just smile at the camera.
[08:49.05]That's how much, how serious I am about this.
[08:51.88]I wouldn't even care.
[08:52.40]You are actually an Alfred.
[08:53.26]I wouldn't even care.
[08:53.82]You're such an Alfred.
[08:54.78]If somebody was like, oh, zero baby.
[08:56.93]You had a zero baby food.
[08:58.73]I'd go, of course I did.
[09:00.73]It's a zero.
[09:01.43]I got a zero.
[09:02.39]Oh, absolutely.
[09:02.84]I wouldn't even care.
[09:03.80]I would be like, please.
[09:04.92]I would cry and say, please just destroy my mouth.
[09:07.70]Absolutely.
[09:08.30]Just shoot a gun in my mouth.
[09:10.07]Let me ask you a question.
[09:12.09]What the fuck?
[09:12.53]Alright.
[09:12.77]Let me ask you a question.
[09:14.21]It's very important.
[09:15.65]Have you ever had the Trader Joe's Pika Masala?
[09:20.92]Oh my God, Jerma.
[09:23.39]I have that in my freezer.
[09:25.85]And I knew it.
[09:26.65]I'm telling you.
[09:27.79]Everyone's like, you've got to ask him about it.
[09:30.26]He probably hates it.
[09:32.28]I knew it.
[09:33.18]Do you want me to be honest?
[09:34.06]Do you want me to be honest?
[09:36.15]Okay.
[09:37.01]I just said I'm getting a zero.
[09:38.41]Be incredibly honest.
[09:40.21]Okay.
[09:40.51]Pull out the video camera.
[09:41.37]Pull out the iPhone and start.
[09:43.30]Go ahead.
[09:43.84]I'm ready.
[09:45.16]Okay.
[09:45.68]Let me be honest.
[09:47.10]Trader Joe's has like a ton of Indian food, right?
[09:50.52]And for my whole life, you know, when I was working in an office, the, you know, the people around me would buy Trader Joe's and they'd be like, hey, Squeaks, I got coconut curry.
[10:01.88]And I got, ooh, I got tikka masala.
[10:04.34]And they would look in my face as if for approval.
[10:07.19]Do you know what I mean?
[10:09.69]Pretty cool, huh?
[10:11.65]See?
[10:11.77]Look what I did.
[10:13.07]But I don't want to ruin this experience for them.
[10:16.16]So I'm like, yeah, that's awesome.
[10:17.38]That's really good.
[10:18.52]But I don't want your sole experience to be Trader Joe's chicken tikka masala.
[10:23.12]Go out there and experiment and get the real thing, not the frozen version, because it can be even better than that.
[10:29.53]Am I against it?
[10:30.73]No.
[10:31.87]Here's my fear.
[10:33.99]Here's the thing.
[10:34.37]I can probably explain that, of why some people would be like, oh, yeah, look, I got the Trader Joe's tikka masala.
[10:39.00]Isn't that great?
[10:39.68]I think a lot of people are just afraid of going to a restaurant, an unfamiliar restaurant, right?
[10:47.15]Like, I don't know this.
[10:48.45]I have never had it before.
[10:50.71]I feel like the restaurant environment there, it's almost like you need a recommendation.
[10:54.80]You need like a really good recommendation because sometimes you just don't know.
[10:58.95]Yeah, it's true.
[10:59.43]And then especially if the waiter's like a bully and asks you about your spice tolerance.
[11:03.17]Yeah, if somebody bullies me about my spice tolerance, I'm going to go to the Trader Joe's frozen aisle.
[11:08.50]No, I completely get it.
[11:10.16]Yeah, I mean, it's a real hit or miss.
[11:12.00]It's a hit or miss.
[11:12.69]But I would say generally, if you go to any Indian store, it's going to be better than Trader Joe's frozen food.
[11:18.19]Okay.
[11:18.45]I hope so.
[11:20.77]I mean, but some of it is really good.
[11:22.48]You know, they have pumpkin spice samosas.
[11:25.02]I bought that too.
[11:26.46]You know, in my fridge, I have every single Trader Joe's item because I was going to do on stream a taste test.
[11:32.19]Dude, that's all.
[11:32.95]Okay.
[11:33.51]Are you going to do a tier list?
[11:34.37]Because literally all of them are S. They're all S.
[11:37.07]Well, I'll be the judge.
[11:38.27]I haven't tried anything.
[11:39.86]Tell me when you're going to do that.
[11:40.76]I want to watch that.
[11:41.48]Because, dude, I am an expert on every item.
[11:43.84]I want to just watch it and see what you do.
[11:45.29]Every single one.
[11:46.69]Oh, okay.
[11:47.09]Great.
[11:47.83]I mean, I can't imagine their naan isn't good.
[11:51.35]Probably amazing.
[11:52.07]I don't think we've ever had it.
[11:53.51]Alright, let me get you in the game.
[11:54.75]We're going to play Turtles in Time SNES.
[11:57.28]We're not going to play the arcade one because the arcade one is the worst version to me.
[12:01.50]And I'm sorry if people don't like that.
[12:03.01]I think the sound is better than the SNES.
[12:04.77]I think the hits hit a little bit harder.
[12:06.07]I only played the arcade one.
[12:07.75]Well, you're about to play the better version.
[12:09.72]Okay, well, I'll be the judge of this.
[12:10.92]This is going to be the start of my tier list.
[12:12.78]Also, Squeaks, this is probably my top five, top ten favorite games of all time.
[12:16.23]So you're on watch right now.
[12:19.80]How do I make a lobby?
[12:21.06]What's the song?
[12:21.82]What's the song that you really love?
[12:24.24]Kiss from a Rose.
[12:25.57]Yeah.
[12:25.95]Oh, that one too.
[12:28.05]You forgot?
[12:30.99]Alright.
[12:31.27]Private lobby.
[12:33.88]Create lobby.
[12:35.70]Oh, is this a hide screen situation?
[12:37.48]This might be a hide screen situation.
[12:39.33]I might have.
[12:39.95]Oh, no, I don't think so.
[12:42.59]Oh, my God.
[12:42.95]Have you seen the intro?
[12:43.57]Does that work?
[12:47.49]Yeah, the intro's great.
[12:48.89]It's awesome.
[12:49.25]Dude, this collection's awesome.
[12:50.37]I played it once already.
[12:52.28]Oh, I'm so excited.
[12:54.28]Wait, so when's the last time you beat in this game?
[12:56.46]Uh, I actually haven't played it in a very long time.
[13:00.05]Okay, I'm in, I think.
[13:02.33]Yeah, you are in.
[13:03.09]Alright, are we ready?
[13:04.72]I'm ready.
[13:04.98]Are you playing with the controller?
[13:06.44]Oh, you have to play with the controller.
[13:07.52]Do you not have a controller?
[13:08.36]Oh, oh, oh.
[13:09.08]I do, I do.
[13:11.61]Alright, it's plugged in.
[13:13.43]Alright, I want everyone to sing along when we get to the first, uh, first level.
[13:17.61]Right.
[13:19.15]I know all the lyrics.
[13:21.84]Alright.
[13:22.06]Who are you going to play as?
[13:23.10]I'm going to play as Michelangelo.
[13:27.60]Okay.
[13:27.72]Good.
[13:29.24]I'll play as Leonardo.
[13:32.03]Okay.
[13:33.03]You're at the cutscene?
[13:35.29]Yeah, I'm at the cutscene.
[13:37.39]Wait, but it didn't let me choose a character.
[13:39.21]Wait, you didn't choose a character?
[13:40.24]No, it didn't let me.
[13:42.46]Wait, you might have to get it for a start.
[13:46.54]Oh, start.
[13:47.80]It says wait a moment.
[13:53.69]There you go.
[13:55.05]Oh, I'm Mike!
[13:57.07]Alright, you ready?
[13:58.49]I'm ready, let's go.
[13:59.35]Let's hope you don't have to eat a fucking ghost pepper!
[14:03.14]Or you have the atomic bomb.
[14:06.78]I already got two kills.
[14:09.05]Oh, so it's competitive?
[14:10.84]I don't know why that's supposed to be like crazy.
[14:12.78]Is this going to be like one of those situations where you're playing dodgeball and you're like, I've played this game 100 times and I get to show off.
[14:19.66]I mean, this is one of my favorite games ever made.
[14:22.15]OK, well, hopefully at the end there's no like score summary.
[14:27.27]Oh, I I have six kills.
[14:31.27]Oh, by the way, do you know the strats you can you can if somebody is leaning forward like that, you can throw them into the screen if you just go close to them and press X. I've been spamming X.
[14:42.61]Oh, so the kills are on the top, so it is keeping track.
[14:46.94]It is, but it doesn't matter.
[14:48.14]Oh, by the way, do you want to put some rules on here?
[14:51.54]Yes.
[14:52.62]Okay, the rules will be as follows.
[14:55.03]Should we be able to rewind?
[14:56.33]No, of course not.
[14:58.81]That's for cheaters, okay.
[15:00.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:00.92]We have to have a raw playthrough.
[15:02.78]It can't be, you know, none of this modern, easy mode.
[15:07.10]And we can't end stream until we beat it.
[15:08.96]Yeah, we cannot end the stream until this game is completed.
[15:11.98]We cannot rewind.
[15:13.51]That's right.
[15:14.73]And unless we get really sleepy.
[15:16.83]I mean, I've got somewhere to be.
[15:20.92]And if you're good, my chat, I'll put on a facecam.
[15:25.39]Now they're going to stay.
[15:26.71]Now they'll stay.
[15:28.45]Oh, yeah.
[15:29.11]And if you're good, chat, my chat, I'll turn off my facecam.
[15:32.96]This will get them to stay for sure.
[15:34.99]They're going to be excited about that.
[15:36.29]I'm not even kidding, by the way.
[15:37.19]It'll turn on if you're good.
[15:40.40]That be good.
[15:41.56]I got a haircut today, Jerma.
[15:45.50]Did you?
[15:46.60]Yeah.
[15:47.82]Two on the sides and a scissor cut up top.
[15:51.13]That's my go-to.
[15:51.85]It's my classic.
[15:52.83]I haven't had a haircut in so long, I forget the haircut.
[15:55.43]I forget what number it is.
[15:57.98]You get that pizza.
[15:58.44]Oh yeah, I don't know how the numbers work either.
[16:00.36]I just say two.
[16:02.50]I think it's like two inches off.
[16:05.11]Any cosmetologist can confirm?
[16:07.84]Watch your HP.
[16:09.12]I don't want to have to have you... I don't want to have to watch you eat a ghost pepper, dude.
[16:12.10]It's gonna be so awful to... It's gonna be so stressful to watch.
[16:16.58]Right.
[16:17.23]And to be clear, I did not... This is a self-inflicted... This is you making that up, right?
[16:23.49]Tell the people that I did not agree.
[16:25.39]He did... He did... Yeah, this is the boss.
[16:30.20]Baxter.
[16:32.59]Wait, okay, wait.
[16:34.13]I feel like I haven't hit him a single time.
[16:35.67]Oh, there we go.
[16:36.01]Yeah, get him.
[16:36.41]Bounce him, bounce him, bounce him.
[16:38.17]Nice job, dude.
[16:39.82]Thank you, thank you.
[16:42.36]Oh, you have 60 kills.
[16:43.66]What is that?
[16:45.63]He's got a little arm that comes out.
[16:48.19]Like Inspector Gadget.
[16:49.33]When he lands, you gotta go get on either side of him and we'll bounce him back and forth.
[16:53.44]Bounce him, bounce him, bounce him.
[16:54.40]Oh, I'm running low on HP.
[16:57.89]How do I bounce him?
[16:59.87]Uh, he's blinking.
[17:02.02]Hey, do you think that it's annoying that for some reason in like the year 2000, every boss before 2000 blinked before they were going to die?
[17:12.41]And now they just don't ever again.
[17:14.29]It was literally in every single video game and it just turned off.
[17:17.39]It was gone forever.
[17:19.09]Yes, but to be fair, everything blinked in old video games.
[17:22.41]Items, like look at the text is blinking.
[17:24.68]Like it's not very epilepsy friendly.
[17:27.64]No.
[17:28.12]But literally the screen would blink like...
[17:31.82]I'm actually glad they turned it off.
[17:34.58]Oh, Cowabunga!
[17:35.74]It was kind of a good indicator of how things were going.
[17:41.11]Yeah, the blinking?
[17:44.13]Oh, Jerm, I hate to be the bad guy here, but it's just that in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, we have to say Cowabunga after every completed level.
[17:54.75]It's kind of good luck.
[17:55.75]I didn't hear that I said Cowabunga, and I just feel like you left me hanging.
[18:02.41]Well, I didn't think it was in the contract for you and I to play.
[18:06.75]Oh, yeah, but here's the thing.
[18:07.74]You know how you signed me up for a ghost pepper?
[18:09.74]Yep.
[18:12.18]It's just kind of like good manners.
[18:14.68]But no, no, you can make your own decision whether you want a cowabunga or not.
[18:21.27]It's just that, just know I will be cowabunga-ing.
[18:23.95]Okay, I will do it if you do it.
[18:27.59]Okay, so cowabunga!
[18:29.89]Well, you can't do it like that.
[18:31.17]Oh, I just fell in a hole, Jerma.
[18:33.19]You gotta do it way more enthusiastically than that.
[18:34.91]You can't just go cowabunga.
[18:37.55]Oh, like enthusiasm?
[18:39.58]Gotcha.
[18:40.56]I'll just do it at a natural point then.
[18:42.76]Let's just forget about this whole conversation.
[18:49.49]Dude, sometimes my game's audio starts slowing down.
[18:53.85]Is it lag?
[18:55.23]Maybe it is lag.
[18:56.53]My game is running so well.
[18:58.37]It hasn't slowed down a single time.
[19:01.48]Is this a host debuff?
[19:03.68]But you're the host.
[19:04.36]Yeah, I don't know.
[19:05.53]Maybe it's like matching my... Because I'm East Coast.
[19:09.33]Cowabunga!
[19:13.94]It's because it's P2P?
[19:16.05]Oh, yeah.
[19:16.35]Sorry.
[19:17.81]Okay.
[19:23.78]You've got a 3080.
[19:25.04]No, actually, I've got a 5080.
[19:26.43]I have a 1070 TI.
[19:28.91]It came with a free month of Microsoft Game Studios, the Game Pass.
[19:35.34]It runs all the games really well.
[19:37.52]No!
[19:37.60]Sorry, I was listening to you, and I picked this up accidentally.
[19:39.16]Wait, how do you do that?
[19:40.44]You've got to pick up the pizza, special pizza.
[19:44.05]Wait, so pizza heals you, and it also gives you, like, an ult?
[19:47.99]Well, the special pizza does.
[19:50.80]What would be a special pizza?
[19:53.50]Uh, if it has a bomb on it?
[19:55.40]That's a health pizza.
[19:56.66]Is that?
[19:57.06]Okay, that's a health.
[19:57.76]I need that.
[19:58.50]I just want everyone to realize that you have picked up every single health pizza, and if we lose, it's because it's not my fault.
[20:05.27]Well, no, here's the thing.
[20:06.23]Like, listen.
[20:06.90]This isn't, we're not playing, like, Minecraft anymore, Jerma.
[20:09.52]This is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[20:11.12]It's every turtle for themselves, alright?
[20:13.22]Alright, this guy's actually hard.
[20:14.14]We gotta be careful.
[20:15.45]Oh, okay.
[20:18.05]Oh!
[20:19.57]Can he fall into that hole?
[20:21.26]Uh, I think he- no, I think only we can.
[20:24.16]We gotta jump that.
[20:25.34]Oh, sh- okay.
[20:30.29]I have depth problems, I- oh.
[20:33.14]You gotta jump that.
[20:34.08]That's it, I think you're gonna be eating a ghost pepper real soon.
[20:38.08]Maybe I should turn off the frame buffer thing.
[20:39.68]Hold on.
[20:40.61]After we fight this boss, I'll do it.
[20:42.81]Oh, dude, I was wondering what that was.
[20:44.81]It must be the frame buffer.
[20:46.51]Alright, we got him.
[20:47.30]He's blinking.
[20:49.10]Got him.
[20:50.06]Cowabunga!
[20:55.84]You ever feel lonely?
[20:57.20]Cowabunga!
[20:58.88]Oh, there we go!
[21:01.43]Mine was... What did I tell you?
[21:03.09]I showed up later, but I did good.
[21:06.16]I mean, I don't know.
[21:06.80]I feel like you don't want to cowabunga compare.
[21:08.99]Every cowabunga stands on its own...
[21:10.58]You know, I will say, though, it is getting kind of irritating.
[21:14.17]Stop pressuring me to open up my fucking Minions Labooboo blind box.
[21:19.46]Stop it.
[21:20.56]I'll do it when I'm ready.
[21:22.14]Listen, I'm not forcing you to do anything.
[21:24.56]You can do whatever you want.
[21:26.09]Like, no one's talking about that right now.
[21:28.95]Alright, I'm going to pause it for a second.
[21:31.22]Wait, I can't pause it.
[21:32.82]You can't.
[21:33.72]How do I pause the game?
[21:35.44]Oh, R.
[21:37.77]No, I don't want to quit.
[21:39.07]It's not pause for me.
[21:40.87]Okay, it's quit game for me.
[21:42.09]Maybe I should turn off that, like, there's like a frame delay thing.
[21:44.30]Maybe I should keep it on or off.
[21:46.24]It seems like it's fine now.
[21:47.52]It's good, it's good.
[21:48.84]Also, this level is awesome.
[21:50.22]Yeah, I love this one.
[21:51.84]Pizza, gonna show up at the bottom.
[21:52.84]Oh!
[21:54.53]I got it.
[21:55.57]I got it, I got it.
[21:57.07]Watch out!
[21:57.51]Oh!
[21:57.61]Pizza up top!
[21:59.19]Stay ahead, stay ahead, stay ahead.
[22:00.93]This is the hard part.
[22:04.40]Oh!
[22:06.24]I stubbed my toe.
[22:08.30]Oh my god.
[22:10.12]I'm hitting every single one!
[22:12.24]You did, I almost hit every single one.
[22:14.76]How am I still alive?
[22:17.25]Ugly creature.
[22:21.15]So Jerma, what's on your ideal pizza?
[22:24.32]Just straight up pepperoni, nothing else.
[22:27.26]No sausage?
[22:28.36]No peppers?
[22:29.94]Nope.
[22:30.62]Pepperoni.
[22:32.63]I think it's more like pizza.
[22:35.27]How do you know it's up there?
[22:39.38]Hey, good job!
[22:43.08]You clearly can't stop thinking about this Minion Labubu thing.
[22:46.27]I mean, I hate to call you out like this, but like... It's clearly on your mind.
[22:53.19]Alright, stay up front.
[22:54.76]Okay.
[22:59.80]The game is not lagging for you?
[23:01.44]No, it's running perfectly!
[23:03.85]It's because I'm hosting and I have to be on.
[23:06.73]Okay.
[23:08.13]Do you want me to host?
[23:09.72]Uh, I- we might have to- Don't lose, otherwise I'm not showing my Labooboo.
[23:15.91]Okay, like, it's fine.
[23:17.23]I mean, you're really- Do you even have- I don't think you even have a Labooboo.
[23:21.03]I think you're just making it up.
[23:22.25]I have one.
[23:24.92]Alright, well, you clearly can't stop thinking about this Labooboo.
[23:27.12]Like, I don't understand.
[23:27.88]Like, is this whole thing just an excuse for you to show off your, what, minion Labooboo?
[23:34.17]Maybe one day.
[23:36.18]Okay, I mean, I hope you get enough confidence to show it.
[23:38.62]I just feel like there's some friction between us because clearly you got Labubu brain.
[23:43.07]Okay.
[23:46.35]Um, I think I'll do it.
[23:48.76]I'll do it.
[23:49.04]You'll do it?
[23:49.46]Yeah, hold on.
[23:51.18]Let's quit the game.
[23:52.54]Okay.
[23:53.92]I hope it saves it, but it took 10 minutes to get here.
[23:59.31]I'm excited.
[23:59.79]I'm going to live react to your Labubu.
[24:02.22]Okay.
[24:03.70]Give me one second.
[24:05.09]Oh yeah, no rush.
[24:06.15]It's just people have been asking me to do this for weeks and I just, I wasn't ready.
[24:10.43]You got Labubu brain right now, I can tell.
[24:13.88]Hold on.
[24:23.89]Is this like a plushie replacement?
[24:25.35]I remember a few times ago you had like a insecure... Hold on, I gotta put these back on.
[24:32.24]Right.
[24:34.42]Is this, like, a new thing?
[24:36.72]I've had this for weeks.
[24:38.72]Oh, you've just been waiting for, like, the opportune moment.
[24:41.69]I've been waiting for the opportune moment.
[24:42.65]Well, here it is, Jeremiah.
[24:43.21]I give you the excuse.
[24:44.31]I'm excited to see it.
[24:46.35]Hold on, I gotta put my headphones back in.
[24:52.06]Okay.
[24:54.39]So what minion are you hoping for?
[24:56.47]I don't know.
[24:57.55]I don't even want to look at it.
[24:58.51]I don't even want to know.
[25:00.50]You clearly do.
[25:03.31]I'll put the cam on, just hold on.
[25:05.73]Alright.
[25:08.96]This thing's fucked up.
[25:09.90]Hold on.
[25:15.25]Okay.
[25:17.31]Here's the first one.
[25:20.37]Can you see me?
[25:21.61]There's a little bit of a delay.
[25:25.78]Okay, hold on a second.
[25:29.95]Okay, so I've been waiting to open this for at least a few weeks.
[25:33.56]I'm so excited.
[25:34.46]I'm honored you're doing it right now.
[25:35.91]I'm super pumped.
[25:37.03]Okay, here we go.
[25:37.95]This is the Despicable Me 4 box.
[25:44.84]Should I show it up here?
[25:48.40]Please show it.
[25:49.36]You have to open it on camera.
[25:51.13]Wait, is it just bad what I'm doing?
[25:52.31]Ripping it up like this?
[25:53.05]No, you're doing it bad because it could be cheated.
[25:54.91]In the Labooboo space, you can't open it off the camera because you can switch in it for a rare one or something.
[25:59.60]Well, I didn't.
[26:00.52]Alright, here we go.
[26:01.36]Here's the big reveal.
[26:05.47]I got a stereo!
[26:06.84]What?
[26:09.52]It's not even a video!
[26:11.10]No, that's not it.
[26:12.02]That's not the whole thing.
[26:13.08]That's not the whole thing.
[26:14.68]Oh, okay.
[26:14.88]Oh, great.
[26:18.53]Oh, they put it in this other plastic thing?
[26:21.85]Remember, it has to be on camera, Jerm.
[26:23.01]I hate to be the chef.
[26:23.53]Alright!
[26:23.71]I'm doing it on camera.
[26:24.63]Here we go!
[26:25.16]Are you ready?
[26:31.32]Here we go.
[26:31.78]Oh, is this one rare?
[26:33.88]Is that rare?
[26:36.10]Oh my god, wait, you got this?
[26:37.79]No way, you got the star sunglasses.
[26:39.87]Dude, that's not rare.
[26:41.21]This is a regular one.
[26:42.43]That's good, I think, right?
[26:45.32]Wait, it even has things to peel off the sunglasses.
[26:54.03]What the fuck is all this plastic on it?
[26:57.43]To preserve the color.
[27:00.02]Well, there it is.
[27:00.58]People have been asking about that for weeks.
[27:03.50]It's not a Labubu.
[27:05.00]It's a Labubu-like, okay?
[27:07.62]Oh, it's not a Labubu?
[27:08.97]Oh, and he can hold the stereo.
[27:16.70]Okay.
[27:17.00]Wow.
[27:17.80]And now I'm going to open my...
[27:21.68]Saw socks.
[27:22.66]What the fuck is this?
[27:23.79]Saw socks.
[27:24.73]Holy shit.
[27:25.57]Wait, there's a part two.
[27:26.73]There could be a rare in here.
[27:28.31]There could be a rare saw socks.
[27:31.05]Okay, let's see it.
[27:31.98]I'm excited.
[27:34.40]What is it?
[27:35.10]Is one of them going to be like saw socks that are like the socks in blood?
[27:38.34]Oh, what the fuck?
[27:45.05]What is that?
[27:47.20]It can be one of these.
[27:49.12]It can be one of these.
[27:50.48]That's what it could be.
[27:52.98]They're just gray socks?
[27:54.35]These are just gray socks.
[27:57.51]They just repackaged Hanes socks.
[28:02.33]With puzzle pieces?
[28:04.40]These are alright, though.
[28:06.78]Well, you know I gotta do it again.
[28:09.10]You know I got 50 of these.
[28:10.86]We'll open them all.
[28:12.17]I'm excited to see.

[28:51.48]Oh, and he's gone.
[28:52.94]Like, uh, I don't know.
[28:53.76]I just feel like, you know, I was there.
[28:55.32]I mean, I don't mind having the Jigsaw sock.
[28:58.41]Dude, I think those glow-in-the-dark, that's actually kind of awesome.

[29:21.55]It glows in the dark.
[29:24.32]Oh, hell yeah.

[29:28.16]I think the whole thing does.
[29:30.36]Wait, I'm actually jealous.
[29:31.78]That's so cool.
[29:33.99]Do you have any minion boxes to open?
[29:37.37]You know what's really sad, Jerma?
[29:39.46]I went to the store, and I said, excuse me, ma'am, do you have any blind boxes?
[29:45.79]And she said, what's that?
[29:47.31]I had to open up Google to tell her that it was, like, you know, Pokémon cards for action figures and stuff.
[29:52.33]And she said, oh, that sounds cute, but no.
[29:56.46]That sounds cute, but no.
[29:58.40]That's what she said to me.
[29:59.50]She's like, that's a cute idea.
[30:02.63]But that's all.
[30:04.55]I don't know what to do.
[30:06.11]Oh, man.
[30:06.70]I know that's sad I was gonna like I looked even on uh on the internet like Amazon but they didn't have like any good ones they just had like random you know pooching cat ones or something like I wanted saw socks dude I'm actually excited about those that was like I was just fucking around but actually I can't wait to make those glow in the dark I'm gonna dance around the house alright um jigsaw here's the here's a question I have right yeah
[30:32.00]frame delay.
[30:33.78]I can do automatic 0, 1, 2, 3.
[30:36.76]How do we make it so his game is running fine and my game is running fine?
[30:40.83]I don't care about a little bit of delay.
[30:42.81]Do you want me to try hosting?
[30:44.61]3 frame delay?
[30:45.49]2 frame delay?
[30:47.25]I think it should be fine as long as we have a delay on it.
[30:49.78]Okay.
[30:49.92]Yeah, let's give it another shot.
[30:53.98]Because it was on automatic before and my game was like, there was points where it was like...
[30:59.83]Oh, wow.
[31:00.45]Oh, that's bad.
[31:01.25]I mean, I know we didn't play it on the Switch because we were scared of that.
[31:04.15]That's like why we did it on here.
[31:06.23]Yeah, dude.
[31:07.19]That's why I re-bought it.
[31:09.77]Somebody said I should put them on my hands and play.
[31:13.98]Socks on hands?
[31:14.98]You don't want to do that.
[31:17.22]Trust me on this.
[31:18.74]No, I hate that.
[31:19.48]I don't like that.
[31:19.90]Don't do it.
[31:20.53]Don't do it.
[31:22.03]Once you do it, there's no going back.
[31:23.83]I already did it, dude.
[31:24.55]It's over.
[31:26.05]This is your expectation for every stream now.
[31:29.83]For the rest of your life.
[31:31.09]Let's try two frame delay.
[31:33.19]Okay.
[31:34.39]Jeremiah, I played Socks on Hands with a Fortnite match, Socks on Hands, and people have gotten absolutely fixated.
[31:40.58]They're like, show your hands.
[31:41.54]Do you got socks on them?
[31:42.62]Socks on Hands.
[31:43.94]It's completely ruined.
[31:45.93]Like, it's ruined my life.
[31:48.35]It's ruined your life?
[31:50.03]They're going to call you Sock Hands.
[31:53.33]I guess that's true.
[31:54.22]I guess it could just ruin your life.
[31:56.52]What a thing to ruin your life.
[31:58.53]yeah socks you wouldn't think about it sock boy sock hands like I sent you an invite alright we got to get back to where we just were fast yeah we can speed run it I just realized it doesn't save great do you see this I did not know that's what that said before I got these what does it say
[32:25.74]It says... It's like a coffee thing that's like, not yet.
[32:29.46]Almost there, depending on the level of how much drink is left.
[32:33.33]It's still doing it.
[32:39.04]It's still doing it, right?
[32:40.12]Am I crazy?
[32:40.90]Maybe I should do like four.
[32:41.72]Uh... It doesn't look delayed for me, but I don't know what you're seeing.
[32:48.59]How about I try hosting?
[32:49.75]Let's see what happens if you host, yeah.
[32:51.47]Yeah.
[32:52.14]So let's just select and I'll quit.
[32:53.94]Okay.
[32:58.98]Yeah, because for me, it's like, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
[33:01.14]It's like, you can, maybe it's, I don't know, it's weird.
[33:07.85]Uh, okay.
[33:08.12]Oh man, that's like even worse now.
[33:10.14]R1 to quit.
[33:12.16]Uh, okay.
[33:13.50]Turtle, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on time.
[33:16.69]Okay, create lobby.
[33:18.55]Let's see.
[33:20.26]Maybe the game is nervous.
[33:23.06]Could be.
[33:23.82]Hey, so it actually doesn't, you said it doesn't save our progress, so we actually have to beat this in one setting, which is fine.
[33:29.01]Yeah.
[33:30.57]It's not long, is it?
[33:31.71]These arcade games are short.
[33:33.12]No, it's like an hour or two max.
[33:35.26]Yeah, that's not bad.
[33:36.58]Okay, did you get my invite?
[33:41.63]And you just did automatic.
[33:43.69]I put it to automatic just to see what it's like for you.
[33:46.54]When you hosted automatic, I had no lag.
[33:48.78]Weird.
[33:49.99]Okay, well, this is the arcade game.
[33:52.38]This is not the SNES one.
[33:55.90]Oh.
[33:57.92]It's the wrong game.
[34:00.51]Wait, but maybe this one runs better.
[34:01.89]No, it's one of the sounds that I like.
[34:04.63]Winners don't use drugs.
[34:07.21]I mean, this one looks pretty good.
[34:08.31]You don't like this one with the song?
[34:12.86]This one's good.
[34:13.58]It's good, but it's... It's fine.
[34:20.96]It's good.
[34:21.52]No, now I feel bad.
[34:22.62]Now you clearly have your heart set on the SNES one.
[34:25.06]Well, there's less stages.
[34:27.84]In this one?
[34:28.65]In this one, yes.
[34:29.93]Okay, let's... Then we'll go back.
[34:31.29]Let's quit game.
[34:32.25]Go back.
[34:33.79]Okay.
[34:34.21]Key of Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[34:35.85]It's the one on the left?
[34:37.83]It's the two-player one.
[34:39.72]Turtles in Time, two players, SNES.
[34:41.20]Okay, okay.
[34:42.08]I see it.
[34:42.46]I see it.
[34:44.76]Okay, perfect.
[34:47.94]Create lobby.
[34:48.80]I'll re-invite you.
[34:49.83]Okay.
[34:51.41]Excellent.
[35:00.81]Okay.
[35:01.87]Okay, now it'll work, I guarantee it.
[35:03.79]Alright, let's make sure.
[35:04.55]Hey, can you wish Ryan a happy birthday?
[35:10.00]Hey, Ryan!
[35:20.04]Happy birthday.
[35:24.02]Give Ryan those jigsaw socks.
[35:26.26]Come on.
[35:26.84]No, those are mine.
[35:27.57]No one's getting those.
[35:28.27]It's his birthday.
[35:29.19]It's light up.
[35:29.85]Come on.
[35:32.09]Alright.
[35:32.31]Here we go.
[35:33.13]I'm in.
[35:34.25]Okay.
[35:34.45]Is it laggy?
[35:36.01]It is not.
[35:38.02]Mine's not laggy either.
[35:39.06]Oh, let's go.
[35:40.04]Let's freaking go.
[35:41.60]Alright.
[35:42.60]Alright.
[35:44.42]So now we're going to...
[35:46.16]Go back to where we were in record time.
[35:48.60]Exactly.
[35:49.00]We'll get there very quickly.
[35:51.19]You ever see the speedrun for this game?
[35:53.15]I have not.
[35:53.55]Is it crazy?
[35:54.89]No, I'm wondering.
[35:56.23]Because I'm sure this has a time.
[35:58.21]I'm curious as to how quick people can beat it.
[36:04.36]Oh, I changed my character, by the way.
[36:06.12]I'm Donatello.
[36:08.00]I've noticed.
[36:08.70]This one's way better.
[36:10.83]Donatello's got better reach, I think.
[36:15.32]Yeah.
[36:16.62]You always choose Leo, huh?
[36:19.07]Well, I identify with Leo the most, I think.
[36:23.52]And why is that?
[36:24.66]Because he's strong.
[36:26.11]He's a leader.
[36:27.29]He shows up on time.
[36:28.51]He's reliable.
[36:30.66]Just like Alfred.
[36:31.98]You're literally, you just said you're not reliable.
[36:34.29]You just said you're not reliable when it came to Alfred.
[36:36.93]Here's what I'm going to say.
[36:37.57]I think you're picking and choosing.
[36:38.71]Jerem, I think you're choosing your favorite characters and you're just making up the characteristics as a matter of fact.
[36:43.88]No, nobody.
[36:44.75]Okay.
[36:44.95]Nobody wants to be the leader.
[36:47.03]Yeah, but except for you.
[36:49.27]No, no, no, but like, all jokes aside, you like this too?
[36:52.44]If you have a group of friends, like, oh man, which one are you?
[36:55.42]What SpongeBob character are you?
[36:57.06]I think everybody wants to be a side, like, ancillary character.
[37:01.11]I don't think anybody wants to be the main character.
[37:02.93]No.
[37:04.51]But this is what I'm saying, is like, someone else has to say, no, you're SpongeBob.
[37:09.16]Like, and then you are SpongeBob, you know what I mean?
[37:11.60]Because you're not going to be like, I'm the lead.
[37:15.88]My game is lagging again.
[37:18.67]Oh, weird.
[37:19.53]What's going on with my game?
[37:22.82]Everything looks fine.
[37:25.98]Yeah, strange.
[37:26.55]My game is not... So you're playing perfectly.
[37:29.85]Perfect.
[37:32.00]Why is my internet being so weird?
[37:34.18]Wait, how come so many more kills than me?
[37:39.00]You think it's the internet or the game?
[37:40.33]I bet you it's the game.
[37:41.87]I don't know.
[37:43.49]Maybe my OBS doesn't like capturing this or something?
[37:46.03]Maybe I'll try a different way to capture it.
[37:47.21]Are you capturing window or game capture?
[37:49.68]Game capture.
[37:52.74]Oh, so it's lagging on OBS but not your own game?
[37:56.89]I think it's doing both.
[37:58.63]Oh, that's really bad.
[38:02.41]Yeah, weird.
[38:04.25]Can we have this issue on playing that dodgeball game on Nintendo?
[38:08.38]Yeah, maybe it's my internet.
[38:11.70]Maybe.
[38:15.43]We're so much better now, by the way.
[38:18.47]You gotta get in here.
[38:19.12]Remember how embarrassing?
[38:20.74]Oh.
[38:21.30]Wait, I should... If you hit him, he goes down?
[38:23.92]Or does he go down?
[38:24.51]I think it's timing.
[38:26.63]Ah, okay, okay.
[38:27.86]You're playing through OBS?
[38:29.08]Oh, I'm not playing the game through OBS.
[38:30.60]No, I'm just saying I think OBS might be lagging the game because it's capturing it, which would be weird.
[38:37.13]Playing the game through OBS is wild.
[38:40.49]Some people do that with consoles.
[38:42.46]Yeah.
[38:44.64]Hold on a second.
[38:45.00]Oh, he's going to die.
[38:47.02]Alright.
[38:47.38]No deaths this time.
[38:53.45]Cowabunga.
[38:53.69]I have a theory.
[38:54.25]Cowabunga.
[38:56.68]Alley cat blues.
[38:58.38]Let me test my theory.
[39:00.07]OK.
[39:07.90]Theory obliterated.
[39:10.48]It's still lagging.
[39:12.36]Oh, I just started lagging a little bit, but it's back.
[39:17.83]That's a shame.
[39:23.85]What other games are even on here?
[39:26.65]I'm scared to play the other ones.
[39:28.29]They have a fighting game, I saw, which I've never even heard of.
[39:32.98]Which is like Tekken, but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[39:37.07]I'd be down to try that out, too, at some point.
[39:39.43]Once we beat this, though, I mean, that's our main goal.
[39:41.98]If we can, I mean, with the lag.
[39:43.62]I mean, it's not horrible, it's just more of an audio problem than it is a video problem.
[39:49.40]Oh, the audio cuts?
[39:50.92]Yeah, that's tough.
[39:52.00]It's trying to catch up with everything that just happened, so it's like... Oh, that's so annoying.
[40:00.13]Yeah, I don't know.
[40:01.25]Let me actually turn up my game.
[40:02.76]Maybe I'm just not noticing that.
[40:06.14]No.
[40:06.84]It sounds good, right?
[40:08.57]Chatters?
[40:09.53]Oh, it actually does sound crap.
[40:13.63]Oh, is it actually happening to you too?
[40:16.38]a little bit it's you'll notice some yeah you'll notice it sometimes oh I didn't even know now that I pointed it out I'm gonna ruin the rest of your time planet wait it's so it's so annoying oh no why did you do this I'm sorry I was so content with it the game so like the game was running fine for me though
[40:39.79]Yeah, the game is running.
[40:40.83]It's just the audio is just like... And the audio is like the best part of this whole game.
[40:45.81]Oh, yeah, it is.
[40:47.12]It's crunchy.
[40:50.14]Oh, don't... Jerma, you're gonna need a pizza soon.
[40:53.50]I'll be careful.
[40:56.43]Just lower the volume so you don't hear the lag.
[40:59.47]What's the condition, Jerma, for you to have a hot pepper?
[41:02.78]Um... I'm ordering this at a zero at the restaurant.
[41:06.30]Ever.
[41:06.42]Ever.
[41:07.75]No, you can't order a hot pepper with zero spice.
[41:10.95]I don't think that's a possibility.
[41:12.87]No, there's a... Oh, I wasted this.
[41:16.40]Or not.
[41:17.68]Yeah, I'd like to have a hot pepper, but could you make that a zero?
[41:21.69]I guess you could take out all the seeds.
[41:22.71]Dude, they're going to hand you a pickle.
[41:24.69]Like, what do you mean?
[41:27.47]You could take out all the seeds, though, couldn't you?
[41:31.04]Are the seeds the spicy part?
[41:32.76]I feel like you'd still get...
[41:35.81]You still would just taste the spice without the seeds.
[41:40.00]Really?
[41:40.56]I don't know if seeds are the spice.
[41:42.42]Wait, I didn't know that.
[41:43.38]Yeah, the seeds is what makes it crazy.
[41:45.94]Wait, even like on a jalapeño?
[41:47.89]Yeah.
[41:49.05]I didn't know.
[41:49.67]Wow, I'm so... I'm so dumb.
[41:54.48]It was every pepper, but what about jalapeño on pizza?
[41:57.56]I don't have seeds there, but it's still spicy.
[42:00.65]If you're talking about sliced jalapeño, usually it'll be sliced with the little middle part with the membrane.
[42:05.49]There's usually some seeds on it.
[42:07.68]Oh, I had no clue.
[42:09.20]Oh, I'm about to die.
[42:10.10]Oh, no.
[42:15.74]This is doubly bad because I didn't even get a labubu.
[42:20.51]Like now, no matter what, you're fine because at least you got those jigsaw socks.
[42:25.89]I'm going to put them under the light and I'm actually curious how much they glow.
[42:31.38]I'm excited.
[42:32.04]I mean, I know once I got a t-shirt of Ghostbusters, where it'd have a ghost with an X on it, and then it would, at night, the X would disappear.
[42:40.60]So it was just the ghost.
[42:42.26]How sick is that?
[42:45.02]I got it at my local Target.
[42:46.71]I know, I got it at my Target.
[42:47.75]I love glow-in-the-dark stuff.
[42:50.33]Except it makes movie theaters awkward.
[42:54.20]Oh, I gotta get my camera back on.
[43:00.17]Only if the chat's good, I thought.
[43:03.13]Oh yeah, you guys have to be good.
[43:04.12]And I'll turn it back on.
[43:10.23]Okay, we're doing better now.
[43:11.59]Except you have twice as many kills.
[43:15.04]How do I have... Oh my god, I do have 200.
[43:16.66]Yeah, I don't know, like... I guess you're really not lagging.
[43:23.19]I'm such an audio weirdo though, dude.
[43:24.83]Like the second if anything sounds like that, it's just like, I gotta fix it.
[43:28.95]Oh, I'm with you.
[43:29.75]I'm with you.
[43:31.47]Especially in these old games where it's 8-bit.
[43:34.98]You're right.
[43:35.36]90% of the charm is just hearing the music and stuff.
[43:40.66]So I totally get it.
[43:43.39]Okay, I'm going to get some kills here, Jerma.
[43:45.39]Okay, because you need to level up.
[43:47.41]Yeah, I need to actually... I don't want to fall behind.
[43:56.73]We are killing it.
[43:58.90]Holy!
[43:59.58]I didn't even get my toe stubbed once.
[44:08.57]Okay, we're going to beat this whole game.
[44:10.13]And in the title of your video, make sure you say, even with an audio glitch.
[44:15.96]You think that would do well?
[44:18.50]We beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with an audio glitch.
[44:21.76]Surprise face.
[44:24.75]I think that'd be a really good vid, actually.
[44:28.99]Alright, good job.
[44:30.25]I like that level a lot.
[44:31.35]I hope there's more.
[44:35.92]I'll fix it in a minute.
[44:38.36]Everything's breaking.
[44:39.50]Alright, first the sewers, then the world.
[44:41.12]Stay up front.
[44:42.48]Okay.
[44:49.35]Ow.
[44:51.07]Oh my god, I thought I was you.
[44:54.48]Ooh, I'm not supposed to get hit by that.
[44:59.01]Should we restart from the beginning?
[45:01.11]We might have to.
[45:02.13]No hit run, no hit run.
[45:04.09]I think we only get a couple of continues.
[45:05.78]We actually have to lock in big time.
[45:07.34]Oh, I died!
[45:08.24]We have to lock in big time.
[45:09.30]Actually lock in.
[45:10.20]Okay, we got this, we got this.
[45:18.65]Alright, we're good.
[45:20.92]Nice!
[45:21.84]Okay, good.
[45:23.74]Right, because in this game, if you lose, you've got to start over.
[45:26.32]And we're not rewinding.
[45:28.15]No rewinds, yeah.
[45:30.31]Unless we, like, really need to.
[45:33.91]Why is my camera so dark now?
[45:39.46]What the fuck did I do?
[45:44.05]I'll fix it at a fucking break.
[45:49.22]This one is one of my favorite levels.
[45:51.48]Okay.
[45:51.74]Okay.
[45:52.97]Let me take a sip of my Nod Coffee.
[45:55.03]This looks so menacing!
[45:57.75]Fight!
[46:02.66]Okay, ready?
[46:04.78]Wait, so what's the story so far?
[46:06.14]I've not been paying attention to the lore.
[46:08.56]We are in the Technodrome, and we're here to stop the Shredder from his diabolical plan to take over the world.
[46:16.99]Okay, and we're here to stop him, gotcha.
[46:18.59]We're here to stop him from doing that.
[46:20.85]Right, and his henchmen are like these silent assassins.
[46:29.52]Yeah, there's a lot of them.
[46:30.68]Do you know the putties from Power Rangers?
[46:34.38]Yes.
[46:35.88]They're like the putties.
[46:37.73]Except they don't go... Do I know the putties from Power Rangers?
[46:41.63]You have to know the putties.
[46:43.05]I don't think I know the putties.
[46:44.29]Yes, you do.
[46:45.75]I swear I don't think I do.
[46:47.22]I don't think I remember.
[46:49.36]Like the bad guys were called putties?
[46:51.20]Let me help you remember.
[46:52.02]Okay.
[46:57.05]Yep, okay, now I remember.
[46:58.37]That helped a lot.
[47:01.94]Right, the putties.
[47:03.36]Of course.
[47:06.05]Those of you that don't know what that is, you're showing how old I am.
[47:10.95]The Power Rangers is not an old man's thing.
[47:12.87]People, young people watch Power Rangers, surely.
[47:15.21]Yeah, but I don't think, do the putties go, I don't think the putties do that.
[47:18.94]They haven't done that since like 1993.
[47:20.34]Oh, now the putties are probably 3D.
[47:23.04]Don't get that, don't touch that.
[47:24.70]Oh, I touched it.
[47:26.09]How you doing?
[47:27.63]Because you, well, I don't know, I got nervous.
[47:31.49]I just, I got excited.
[47:33.18]I also need those kills.
[47:37.22]You get those kills.
[47:41.63]Okay.
[47:43.45]Good.
[47:44.13]Okay, and then just to recap some of the moves, X is to hit and AX is to jump dive.
[47:54.06]I've seen you not do jump dives.
[47:55.79]Is that on purpose?
[47:56.19]You can also do this.
[47:56.95]It costs health to do that, but it's a huge omega panic button.
[48:01.38]What button is that?
[48:02.04]We have to decide who's going to... Pause it for a second.
[48:05.60]We can't pause.
[48:07.38]We're good right here.
[48:09.49]Okay.
[48:10.48]Okay, we have to decide who's going to fight who.
[48:15.71]Okay, what are the two options?
[48:17.23]Hold on.
[48:17.43]Do you want the turtle or do you want the wolf?
[48:23.92]I'll do the wolf.
[48:24.78]Is the wolf easier?
[48:25.60]They're both difficult.
[48:28.28]Okay, I'll do the wolf.
[48:29.28]Okay, I'll go turtle.
[48:30.95]Okay.
[48:32.21]I'm ready.
[48:33.39]Is that the turtle?
[48:34.09]Okay, here's the wolf.
[48:34.89]The one on the left is the turtle.
[48:37.33]Oh, well, I mean, he's also wolf-like.
[48:39.85]He just has a shell.
[48:41.66]The wolf is actually harder, by the way.
[48:43.16]I forgot to tell you.
[48:44.58]Oh, so do you want to switch?
[48:48.10]They're together.
[48:48.74]I just got splatted on the wall.
[48:52.49]I'm on fire.
[48:54.43]Be careful.
[48:54.83]Once you hit do enough attacks, they're going to do an immediate counterattack.
[48:59.05]Oh, my God.
[48:59.87]I just got hit.
[49:04.48]Okay, I'm just going to try to stay alive.
[49:06.69]I'm getting smashed here.
[49:09.36]No.
[49:14.85]I'm 1 HP.
[49:16.33]And I have no more lives.
[49:17.59]I need you to clutch.
[49:18.69]Just get out of the way.
[49:19.45]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[49:22.02]That's it.
[49:22.60]Protect me.
[49:25.08]We're good.
[49:26.74]Nice.
[49:27.78]Oh, wait.
[49:28.22]That's a dog.
[49:29.15]Yeah, yeah.
[49:29.85]We did it.
[49:32.07]Wait, that was a dog and we hurt them.
[49:36.92]Get that pizza.
[49:38.70]I need it.
[49:39.06]We actually have to pick a side.
[49:41.12]Left or right?
[49:42.64]I'll go to the right.
[49:43.48]Good.
[49:43.76]Alright.
[49:44.00]Let's go.
[49:45.02]Stuff's going to come out from the doorways.
[49:48.63]I'm spamming X. You got it.
[49:51.09]You got it.
[49:54.67]You alright over there?
[49:55.34]I know.
[49:56.34]I'm chill.
[49:56.78]I'm having fun.
[49:58.24]Don't kill my guys.
[50:01.82]I'm just launching them towards you.
[50:04.81]Good luck.
[50:06.94]Oh.
[50:09.16]I got shot through the door.
[50:10.78]I like how they tap their feet.
[50:18.30]Oh, my.
[50:18.62]Dude, when I was younger, we used to be able to get rid of that in one swing.
[50:23.42]Yeah, I mean, we can just keep playing this game until we get really good at it.
[50:26.35]I'm down.
[50:28.79]I'm down to commit like a month to this.
[50:31.62]I mean, this is one of the best games ever made.
[50:34.54]Okay, top five games of all time.
[50:36.57]Go ahead.
[50:37.17]Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, Team Fortress 2, Diablo II, and The Neverhood.
[50:43.94]Done.
[50:45.60]Oh, yeah.
[50:46.62]That's a good list.
[50:47.50]Chrono Trigger is so good.
[50:49.59]The music of Chrono Trigger, best game soundtrack of all time.
[50:52.95]It's not even a hot take.
[50:54.05]I said that like I dropped some like... Dude, that was crazy what you just said.
[50:58.56]Alright, here we go.
[50:59.88]What is this?
[51:00.40]What are we doing?
[51:02.44]You'll see.
[51:03.18]Do you want me to tell you or do you want to figure it out?
[51:06.45]I'll figure it out.
[51:07.75]I'm a smart guy.
[51:08.47]No, no, no.
[51:09.21]We have to restart this if we lose.
[51:11.07]You want to throw it?
[51:11.85]Okay, tell me, tell me, tell me.
[51:14.25]I can't tell you what's wrong with me.
[51:16.09]My mouth is fucked up.
[51:17.70]Okay.
[51:19.28]Throw people into them.
[51:22.62]Throw people into the screen.
[51:24.38]This was huge back in 1995.
[51:26.72]Gotcha.
[51:28.04]Dude, you're dead.
[51:29.62]I'm not dead.
[51:30.50]I'm not dead.
[51:32.76]Jerm, I need you to clutch here.
[51:36.91]There you go.
[51:37.27]There you go.
[51:45.28]Oh, my God.
[51:46.02]Oh.
[51:46.80]One more.
[51:47.04]One more.
[51:47.28]One more.
[51:49.20]Oh, come on.
[51:49.62]One more.
[51:50.40]He's aiming at me.
[51:51.02]He's aiming at me.
[51:51.46]There we go.
[51:51.98]That's a big deal.
[51:53.22]Nah.
[51:54.12]One HP.
[51:54.91]Look at our HP up there.
[51:58.73]Holy... Alright, we beat it.
[52:00.04]We beat the game.
[52:01.60]My patience is wearing thin.
[52:03.36]I'm banishing you to a time warp from which you will never return.
[52:07.52]Oh, he's evil.
[52:15.32]Okay, I think we're almost beating this.
[52:17.80]Like, this has got to be, like, the last few levels here, right?
[52:20.44]Uh, we just beat the tutorial.
[52:23.19]Ah.
[52:26.09]So, like, if this is on arcade, you are hogging the arcade machine for, like, two hours?
[52:34.40]Um... You got four slots.
[52:38.07]It's imagining that somebody's gonna run out of coins, and then some rando's gonna take over Michelangelo's slot halfway through the game.
[52:47.20]Yeah, but, like, what if there's, like, eight people waiting?
[52:49.22]You just have to have the four... You're gonna ruin some kid's birthday party?
[52:53.59]You're like, no, sorry, we have to beat this in one go, or Squeaks has a ghost pepper.
[52:59.72]Imagine turning around to a group of kids.
[53:02.34]No, sorry, kids.
[53:03.75]Sorry, you're going to have to come here another day.
[53:05.79]Is this birthday today?
[53:07.21]Let's do it tomorrow.
[53:08.23]Do the birthday tomorrow.
[53:09.43]He's going to eat a ghost pepper if we don't beat this.
[53:11.82]Yeah, it's content, alright.
[53:14.82]This is kind of a job here, Buggo.
[53:16.50]Yes, we're doing content here, excuse me.
[53:19.20]Oh, please, you're in frame.
[53:21.83]You just got a one-up.
[53:23.85]Hey, have you ever been in someone's like random, like someone's recording something in public and you're just walking in the background?
[53:30.84]uh like uh in New York city there's like a bunch of people who are like filming tick tocks up against a building and I realized I'm just walking in the background of so many of them dude I gotta take for you I gotta take for you okay if I ever see that I avoid it I like find a path to make it so I'm not even in that view of that camera if somebody has a camera out like video and talking I'm like going around way out of my way to get away from that video
[53:58.33]Yeah, but sometimes you can't.
[54:00.41]Yes, you can.
[54:01.13]You'll find a way.
[54:01.97]You'd go in the middle of the road?
[54:04.41]No, you'd just like duck into a fucking CVS or something.
[54:08.20]Jerma, I have an idea for you where it won't inconvenience you and you won't be on anyone's video.
[54:12.52]Okay.
[54:12.78]Blast Disney music on your phone as you're walking by.
[54:15.51]These guys are... They can't upload it.
[54:21.43]Everyone just hates you.
[54:23.80]I mean, I didn't say you're going to make friends this way, but it's a surefire way to, you know...
[54:28.80]Take up the space.
[54:29.84]Dude, if I hear... If I hear... What's going on, everybody?
[54:33.93]Anywhere.
[54:34.43]Out in public.
[54:35.17]I am fucking going... I'm just, like, dipping into the bathroom.
[54:39.11]Yeah, me too.
[54:40.17]It's embarrassing.
[54:41.31]You ever record something in public?
[54:43.46]No.
[54:45.30]I don't even like taking pictures in public.
[54:46.96]Neither do I. I feel like everyone's judging me.
[54:48.46]I know, I'm with you.
[54:50.04]Oh, and I'm almost dead, by the way.
[54:51.68]Alright, watch out for stalactites.
[54:53.18]They're called that because they hang.
[54:55.69]And stalagmites are the ones on the floor?
[54:57.81]They grow out of the ground.
[54:59.79]I actually remember that from class.
[55:05.65]Uh... Zero lives, by the way, so play like your life is on the line.
[55:11.36]Don't worry.
[55:11.80]I think we have a couple continues, but we shouldn't even need to use them.
[55:16.02]Nice.
[55:16.43]I got one up.
[55:18.05]Oh, no continues allowed, by the way.
[55:20.03]No, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
[55:20.95]We can get... We'll be here all day, Squeaks.
[55:23.89]What is that?
[55:24.68]This will be the only thing we do.
[55:26.88]Yeah, it's fine.
[55:27.30]For like a week.
[55:27.96]I just got crushed.
[55:28.74]I'm dead, so...
[55:30.26]Alright, you're gonna have to use one of those continues.
[55:32.28]I didn't use a continue.
[55:33.35]Alright, come on.
[55:34.43]I was just joking around.
[55:35.59]I think we only have one or two more of those.
[55:38.41]Don't quit screwing around.
[55:39.55]Reel it in.
[55:40.03]Right, right, right.
[55:40.67]Sorry.
[55:41.05]Right, right.
[55:42.84]I mean, you're the one who brought up stalagmites and stalag- I need help.
[55:48.84]I love how you're calling that out like it's like we're in a Counter-Strike game.
[55:52.85]I need help.
[55:53.45]I'm on B. I'm pushing.
[55:56.89]I have the Counter-Strike accent, I guess.
[56:01.21]been playing a lot oh these guys are big I'm playing like right now no I'm the one who used to continue if we don't win it's my fault I deserve a ghost pepper I'd be very careful here uh slash is difficult you'll see why he parries everything from the front oh Jesus so one of us has to hit him in the back okay I'll distract them
[56:28.41]No, if we go on opposite sides, we have one free hit no matter what.
[56:33.68]Get on his left side.
[56:34.80]I'm going to be on the right side.
[56:36.61]Oh my god.
[56:37.63]He turned around.
[56:38.19]It's not looking good for me.
[56:42.64]Alright, get over here.
[56:50.23]Oh.
[56:51.31]No, no, no.
[56:52.19]Stay.
[56:52.37]Stay.
[56:53.19]Hit him back.
[56:53.71]Hit him back.
[56:54.25]Bounce him back.
[56:54.72]Bounce him back.
[56:55.92]I'm dead.
[56:57.30]Hit him right now.
[56:57.90]I'm hitting him.
[56:59.52]Don't stop spamming.
[57:00.69]Oh, fuck.
[57:02.29]This is actually a disaster.
[57:03.03]We're going to lose her.
[57:04.49]No, no, no, no, no.
[57:05.69]Not with that attitude.
[57:09.36]There we go.
[57:11.52]He's just so good.
[57:14.43]Just keep him in the middle here.
[57:16.57]He hit me.
[57:27.66]No, no, no, no, no.
[57:31.53]I had so much saliva in my mouth when I just said that.
[57:35.81]This is coffee.
[57:37.77]One more hit.
[57:38.32]OK.
[57:39.84]Oh, I think we got it.
[57:40.62]I need your help.
[57:45.26]I'm going as Michelangelo.
[57:50.47]Alright, there we go.
[57:51.15]OK, nice.
[57:53.53]OK, we managed to do it.
[57:55.24]That's an insane boss.
[57:59.44]So how many tickets is that worth?
[58:02.88]Three.
[58:04.72]Oh man, that's not even enough to get a keychain.
[58:07.77]That should be at least a stuffed animal.
[58:16.14]This is a great level.
[58:18.56]Wait, so the lore, we got sucked out of that level and we're going into the pirate level?
[58:24.05]Yep.
[58:25.17]Okay.
[58:27.73]I'm just trying to follow.
[58:32.97]Okay.
[58:33.97]Does this one end with a tough boss as well?
[58:36.71]It does.
[58:37.09]This one actually is one of the harder ones.
[58:38.74]It's Bebop and Rocksteady.
[58:45.13]Cowabunga, by the way.
[58:46.69]Oh, I forgot.
[58:47.49]I completely forgot.
[58:49.25]I like the music to this one.
[58:55.75]The soundtrack is one of the best SNES soundtracks, for sure.
[59:00.63]I don't even know if I've ever played the SNES version.
[59:03.35]When I hear Turtles in Time, I think of my local pizza place for having the arcade cabinet.
[59:08.05]I had no idea that it was different than the SNES one.
[59:13.44]Dude, the regular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game, not Turtles in Time, is amazing.
[59:18.91]I think I played Turtles in Time, though.
[59:22.07]It wasn't the original.
[59:23.31]Turtles in Time was also a cabinet.
[59:26.47]Oh, God.
[59:26.83]Do we have enough continues?
[59:28.00]Oh, no.
[59:28.44]Is there infinite continues?
[59:30.17]They might be infinite continues.
[59:32.10]Wait, then we're chilling.
[59:33.14]Then we're good.
[59:33.96]Okay.
[59:35.18]Like, you ever play the game Crazy Taxi at the arcade?
[59:38.25]Yes.
[59:39.33]Like, when that came out on the GameCube or the, you know... It came out on the Dreamcast, too.
[59:44.50]It was just exactly the same thing.
[59:46.94]Like, I don't think they changed a single thing.
[59:48.88]I think Dreamcast got such a bad rap.
[59:50.85]It got such the... What a short end of the stick.
[59:53.63]They were so early in being the best console and, like, nobody wanted it.
[59:57.93]Yeah, true.
[59:58.68]I mean, the Sonic games were so good on the Dreamcast.
[60:02.50]Oh, my God.
[60:03.61]Oh, boy.
[60:04.47]Yeah, that little memory card innovation, I cannot believe that we didn't get more of that.
[60:12.67]With the memory card with the little screen, the little, what is it, the VMU?
[60:15.39]Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, of course.
[60:17.65]It was so cool.
[60:18.29]I thought everyone was going to start doing that.
[60:20.73]I guess you could say like the DS or the, you know, I guess the handheld started to do it a little better.
[60:24.58]Even the Wii U, the Wii U looked, I like the Wii U, but I know that console flopped.
[60:30.84]But people also forget the GameCube flopped because it was, GameCube didn't sell that well.
[60:38.05]Was the GameCube really a flop?
[60:39.57]I guess maybe it was, yeah.
[60:41.22]Yeah, but, I mean, people just love it because of the, in retrospect, like, it had Melee and stuff, but it wasn't, it didn't do as well.
[60:47.55]It wasn't as bad as the Wii U. I know.
[60:50.03]Think about it.
[60:50.51]All these people that are making these consoles, Nintendo, SEGA, Sony, whatever, it doesn't sound, it doesn't feel like, oh, yeah, we had that last console.
[61:00.23]It was a total fucking commercial failure.
[61:02.49]Oh, it was?
[61:03.57]Oh, yeah, actually, the last four of our consoles.
[61:05.01]Yeah, but it has so many good games.
[61:06.32]Yeah.
[61:06.63]Yeah, it was like, oh, the last four of our consoles were complete and total fucking commercial failures.
[61:11.00]But we're going to make another one.
[61:13.56]It's like, oh, okay.
[61:15.53]We'll give it a shot.
[61:16.63]And especially when they call it a commercial failure, you just have good memories of playing it with your friends, getting pizza.
[61:23.60]That was fucking horrible.
[61:24.82]What a waste of investment.
[61:26.70]I love Power Stone.
[61:27.69]I had so much fun playing Power Stone on the Dreamcast.
[61:31.29]and oh I think I I think I know power stone to learn that it was one of the probably the best fighting game ever I think it was an arcade how do I know oh yes it must have been uh but to learn that oh yeah not only was the Dreamcast a failure
[61:49.48]I mean, that hole in everything was a failure.
[61:51.54]You having fun was... There was some guy in a boardroom sweating his ass off, being like, this is a fucking nightmare.
[61:57.11]What a fucking nightmare.
[61:58.42]This is so bad.
[61:59.12]This is not good.
[61:59.66]Everything about this is bad.
[62:00.82]What do we do?
[62:01.18]How do we salvage how terrible this is?
[62:02.49]And I'm just like, like you said, eating pizza, laughing with my friends.
[62:05.73]Yeah, yeah.
[62:06.93]Yeah, now they'll just make it live service or something.
[62:12.05]They'll fix it.
[62:13.15]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you could buy skins.
[62:16.02]There you go.
[62:16.80]And now we're turned to profit.
[62:18.68]I bet you there's a version of this game on mobile.
[62:22.01]I think they've remade it, but it was alright.
[62:24.95]I think it was like Xbox Live.
[62:27.88]Wait, I'm doing so much damage in this corner.
[62:31.44]Yeah, we get infinite continues.
[62:32.58]We're fine.
[62:33.62]Oh, then we're totally chilling.
[62:35.25]Then I guess I'm not having a ghost pepper.
[62:38.16]Can you pretend to eat one?
[62:40.40]Oh, I would do such a good job, I think.
[62:42.75]Okay, who do you think could do a better job pretending to eat a ghost pepper?
[62:46.64]Me or you?
[62:47.66]I think both you and I are gonna have the most cartoonish I don't think so I think I think I could probably do it better wait actually you know I'm so down and the people who are watching this right now we should do like a ghost pepper challenge where only the people watching now know it's fake that's funny actually and we're just it's just gonna be like pickles pickle assortment yeah we both have a bite to sell it and like get up oh I'm not gonna tell you my strategy
[63:14.54]No, no, no.
[63:15.36]I'm gonna have a glass of milk.
[63:17.05]I'm gonna start crying.
[63:18.25]Yeah.
[63:19.89]Were you a theater kid?
[63:21.27]Yes.
[63:22.41]Okay, me too.
[63:23.53]Perfect.
[63:23.85]So then we'll really oversell it.
[63:34.39]Oh, wow.
[63:34.85]This one's on a moving train.
[63:36.73]What am I gonna do with these?
[63:37.85]I don't want these.
[63:40.13]Are you... These meaning your socks and stuff?
[63:44.16]Mm-hmm.
[63:45.24]You better not be talking about that, because I would have killed for those glow-in-the-dark jigsaw socks.
[63:51.65]I opened another minion box silently without you knowing.
[63:57.20]Sorry I didn't include you.
[63:59.59]That's... so fucked up.
[64:05.00]You're addicted.
[64:08.53]speaking of that'd be the worst addiction ever is opening how would anyone take you seriously like I'm addicted to opening minion labubu boxes I'll tell you I already am a half okay what's the right side and left side of your brains one's like the logical one one's the like funny one I think left is logic well one's like the fun one one's the serious one right
[64:29.89]The right brain, the logical one, is right now screaming at the left side, saying, you fucking idiot, I already see the clipped thumbnails of people being like, oh, look, the Jerma opens his minion.
[64:46.71]Right.
[64:47.59]And like airbrushed with something real YouTuber-y.
[64:55.68]Yeah, but just wait until we do the hot pepper challenge.
[64:57.72]That thumbnail is going to go crazy.
[65:02.20]With, like, our tongues out and there's going to be red hot peppers coming out.
[65:05.75]It's going to look so freaking cartoonish.
[65:09.01]Okay, we have to make a time limit on this, right?
[65:11.18]So here's the deal.
[65:12.58]You and I, in the near future, are going to have a fake hot pepper challenge, right?
[65:17.69]That's what we're establishing.
[65:19.47]Yes.
[65:20.47]This needs to be a 30-minute performance.
[65:23.36]Okay.
[65:24.25]Okay.
[65:25.37]You have to be on camera for 30 minutes going over your journey after eating the ghost pepper.
[65:33.17]I'm down.
[65:34.02]No, I'm 100% down.
[65:35.64]Okay.
[65:35.76]And are we doing it at the same time on the same day?
[65:38.72]Same time, same day.
[65:39.94]And then we pretend like we're going to play Among Us after, but we never do.
[65:43.58]And then we ban the term Among Us from our chat.
[65:46.47]It's already banned from my chat.
[65:47.55]So I'm already super ahead of you.
[65:50.09]Okay, great.
[65:51.68]Then we play more Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[65:54.29]If you laugh, by the way, if you laugh, you're out.
[65:56.39]If you laugh, you automatically lose.
[65:57.61]No, 100%.
[65:58.15]No, no.
[65:58.39]We have to play it earnestly.
[65:59.61]Yes.
[65:59.81]Like the hot pepper challenge.
[66:00.99]I'm super down.
[66:02.19]Alright.
[66:02.69]If you laugh, you can't break at all.
[66:04.50]It's over.
[66:05.34]The challenge is over.
[66:07.24]We'll set it up.
[66:08.52]We'll set it up.
[66:09.02]And only the people here know it's fake.
[66:10.50]Yeah.
[66:11.52]Maybe this is controversial, though.
[66:13.38]What if we're casted as some evil villain?
[66:18.19]We're faking a challenge.
[66:19.47]Okay.
[66:19.59]Not if we put in our titles.
[66:21.82]Performance art.
[66:23.00]Eating a- Right, or like, parody.
[66:27.65]Yeah, eating a ghost pepper parody, in parentheses, yeah.
[66:31.94]That's perfect.
[66:32.56]Okay.
[66:33.18]Alright, we'll make it happen.
[66:34.70]Maybe, uh, can we have like a- Why would you scream that?
[66:37.20]Why would you scream that?
[66:38.69]That's like such a stupid- that's so funny.
[66:41.23]Like, why would you make a video of that?
[66:43.37]Like, I really want to show my performing skills.
[66:46.92]Acting class type of thing where it's some actor that's like, you know, trying to get their name out there.
[66:52.48]And, you know, I'm going to I'm going to I ate a ghost pepper.
[66:54.37]Look at my fucking acting skills.
[66:57.29]I mean, who knows?
[66:58.01]We can maybe land a gig with this, Jeremiah.
[66:59.84]You never know.
[67:00.94]It's true innovation like no one's done it before.
[67:03.98]We are 100 percent doing this.
[67:06.51]Yeah, I actually don't.
[67:07.97]We have to make a day for this because I'm going to make a whole day out of it.
[67:11.69]Yeah, I'll make a whole day out of it, too.
[67:13.75]Dude, I'm gonna run to the bathroom in the middle of mine and play, like, fucking diarrhea noises and stuff.
[67:19.52]Yeah, but you have to really sell it, Trevor.
[67:21.26]You can't, like, go... It's just... It's too fake.
[67:24.12]It's way too fake.
[67:26.64]You have to, like, really pretend like you're gonna be brave.
[67:28.82]You can't just go, like... You can't just put smoke effects out of your ears.
[67:33.07]Why not?
[67:33.83]That's funny.
[67:34.41]No, because you have to sell it.
[67:36.03]Don't you want the big job here?
[67:37.71]Like, an acting job?
[67:39.99]Dude, you know what we're both going to do on that first bite.
[67:43.75]We're going to sit there and we're going to do like the... I feel it a little bit.
[67:47.82]I feel it a little.
[67:48.62]It's starting to climb up a little.
[67:49.92]My tongue's a little tingly.
[67:51.56]It's going to be so hard to not laugh at this.
[67:53.66]Wait, I have a great idea.
[67:55.68]You know hot ones?
[67:58.11]We fake do hot ones.
[68:01.53]Where all of the spices are just mild sauces.
[68:07.17]But am I interviewing you during this?
[68:09.72]Or are we in separate shows?
[68:11.50]No, we'll do separate shows.
[68:14.89]Squeaks, are you going to TwitchCon?
[68:17.05]No.
[68:19.11]Oh, man.
[68:19.97]Wait, when is TwitchCon?
[68:22.76]October 19th?
[68:26.87]No, yeah, I don't think I am.
[68:29.11]Are you?
[68:29.45]I might be.
[68:31.49]It's in San Diego, right?
[68:33.51]Okay, that's because I'm going to be honest.
[68:34.83]I don't want to go to a convention.
[68:36.56]I'd rather just hang out outside of it.
[68:39.22]That's why I'm going to be at TwitchCon for like an hour and 25 minutes.
[68:43.39]Okay.
[68:44.73]It's weird that you added 25 minutes, by the way.
[68:47.65]Did you just think of something?
[68:48.81]That's to account for traffic.
[68:51.42]Okay, so hold on.
[68:52.76]You're counting your commute as part of you being at TwitchCon?
[68:56.70]Yeah.
[69:00.15]Okay.
[69:01.00]Okay, so then why not count your flight as well?
[69:05.83]Okay.
[69:06.39]You'll be at TwitchCon for hours.
[69:08.59]I'll be at TwitchCon for like three or four hours.
[69:12.38]Okay, so then you're going to go all the way there and then you're just going to leave?
[69:16.42]Like, are you going to do something else?
[69:18.18]Just going to hang out?
[69:18.94]I want to just hang out.
[69:20.68]I mean, hey, I just came back from San Diego.
[69:22.95]It's beautiful.
[69:23.57]So I get it.
[69:27.65]It's actually probably one of the best places in the world.
[69:31.80]San Diego?
[69:33.10]Yeah, for sure.
[69:34.12]I've only been to San Diego, I think, once, and it was for an old TwitchCon.
[69:39.49]It's nice.
[69:42.12]Dude, did I tell you my idea for TwitchCon?
[69:43.72]It's never happening.
[69:44.92]This will never happen.
[69:47.38]No, let's hear it.
[69:49.71]I was thinking about going one year.
[69:50.93]This is like a few years ago.
[69:53.97]Well, there's two different ideas.
[69:54.92]They're both kind of similar concepts.
[69:58.01]I tried to avoid that.
[69:59.91]One of them was I was going to dress up in a fursuit and not tell anybody.
[70:05.56]Okay.
[70:05.98]And just go to the convention in a full fursuit.
[70:10.09]Okay, and that's it?
[70:11.35]That was it.
[70:11.97]And see if people would be like, oh, did you see that guy that was in the fucking dog costume?
[70:17.04]Yeah, that guy had a crazy cosplay.
[70:18.60]It was me the whole time, and I just don't even talk about it.
[70:20.50]I never even bring it up.
[70:22.21]Okay, that sounds interesting.
[70:24.77]What would be the point of it?
[70:26.11]To me.
[70:26.38]It's funny to me.
[70:27.26]For you.
[70:27.74]Okay, okay.
[70:28.18]I get it.
[70:28.62]I also wanted to go in full prosthetic old person makeup, like spend like thousands and thousands of dollars to make myself look like I'm like a hundred.
[70:36.93]And see if I could put like a little cap on and have a cane and walk around and see if anybody knew it was me.
[70:43.82]Okay, but that idea would be really good because then you can like meet everybody and you can say, you can do a tier list of what streamers were the nicest and the meanest to you as an old person.
[70:55.38]You know what I mean?
[70:56.80]This TwitchCon, if I do go, there is something that I probably am doing that is going to be fun, I think.
[71:03.35]Oh, and you're not leaking?
[71:04.84]No, there's no leaks at all.
[71:06.36]No, no, no, no.
[71:07.97]I don't think so, but, like, uh, if there's an ad or something at TwitchCon, then I might be, then I might go.
[71:14.96]Oh, you're gonna take, like, a sponsor?
[71:16.41]Yeah!
[71:18.53]Really?
[71:18.79]They do TwitchCon sponsors?
[71:20.47]Like, you go to TwitchCon with a, what do you wear, like, a NASCAR fucking thing all over you?
[71:24.97]How does that work?
[71:25.57]There was one TwitchCon a while back where they wanted me to play Genshin Impact on stage.
[71:31.57]And I said, yes, but the more I thought about it, the more I was like, that's horrible because then chatters are going to be like watching live and they're going to yell stuff at me and there's no mods.
[71:41.69]So I had to back out of it because I don't want a live chatter experience.
[71:46.27]That sounds terrible.
[71:47.13]I feel like a zoo animal.
[71:48.43]Well, that's when you get up and you just start screaming for everybody to like shut the fuck up and stuff like that.
[71:52.76]get up like take the headset off well they actually can't do that because it's sponsored right no I can't I mean they're probably cool with that like pick somebody out in the audience like have a plant in the audience that you like get in their face and like scream at them yeah and then the joke is wow squeaks was really rude at Twitch like they're heckling and you grab them by the shirt you pull them in and say stop with my money stop with me my money stop with my money yeah I think I could pull that off
[72:21.16]Or I could say, let's go band for band.
[72:23.96]That's the new thing.
[72:26.61]I can even say it menacingly.
[72:27.97]Oh, wait, I actually did a bit like that, actually, with S-Fan.
[72:33.57]You did?
[72:34.70]Yeah, I was like, we both had an ad at DreamHack, and I was IRL streaming, and then S-Fan came up to me and was like, hey, man, I'm a big fan.
[72:43.17]I said, hey, listen, man, let personal things be personal.
[72:46.23]I'm not interested in interacting right now.
[72:47.85]I'm doing my show.
[72:49.76]Oh, wow.
[72:52.46]And nobody knew it.
[72:54.35]That was the bit.
[72:56.59]I don't know why.
[72:57.43]It was just an impromptu thing.
[72:58.79]We're getting close.
[73:00.75]To the end?
[73:01.56]We're getting close.
[73:02.42]I think there's one more level.
[73:05.16]Oh, no.
[73:06.20]Okay, can we do a prediction in the chat?
[73:08.29]Will we need to continue more than five times collectively to beat Shredder?
[73:14.28]And when I say beat Shredder, I mean beat Shredder.
[73:17.46]Oh, my God.
[73:17.98]It's that hard?
[73:18.98]We haven't had five continues in anything.
[73:22.55]Oh, so if you did this at the arcade, you'd be the coolest kid.
[73:25.23]I get it.
[73:25.59]You'd be pretty cool.
[73:27.36]Yeah, everything.
[73:27.94]So it's worth it to ruin that guy's birthday party.
[73:31.32]Yeah, we're making content.
[73:31.92]The kids aren't going to be excited.
[73:33.14]Yeah, no, I get it.
[73:38.41]Okay, so are we on the moon or something?
[73:39.83]Like, what's this planet?
[73:40.49]We're on Mars?
[73:43.57]Uh, we're on the... whatever planet it is.
[73:46.83]It looks like Mars.
[73:48.64]I'm just trying to keep up with the story.
[73:58.11]Was that in the game?
[74:00.85]I don't know if I've gotten used to the audio glitches or if it actually is fine.
[74:06.18]It still is glitching.
[74:07.20]I'm sorry to be that guy.
[74:08.26]At least I hear it.
[74:09.92]Yeah, I can still hear it.
[74:11.52]Or maybe it took time for it to synchronize.
[74:17.27]Oh, there's a spawner.
[74:20.47]Dude, you have 111 kills?
[74:22.60]I'm 19.
[74:22.92]I'm popping off.
[74:24.38]Oh my God, I haven't barely been playing.
[74:26.48]One of my most prized possessions is I own this cartridge of the box and everything.
[74:34.61]You know, I I want to start game collecting.
[74:37.47]This would be a good game collecting thing because back then the boxes were so special, especially if they're like marble boxes and they would open or like even the manuals.
[74:46.62]Like I was looking online for Sim City 3000 boxes recently because I just remember that box being so beautiful.
[74:53.59]But you'd open it up and you'd just see like this miniature, you know, 2D city.
[74:58.74]It'd be so cool.
[74:59.72]Or even The Sims 1.
[75:01.16]I don't know.
[75:01.64]I just missed that.
[75:02.44]They don't make them like they used to.
[75:03.50]I'm going to be Boomer here and it's fine.
[75:05.69]They don't make them like they used to.
[75:07.01]It was so cool.
[75:08.01]No, they don't.
[75:09.29]The boxes, the box art, all the manuals, all the cool things, the little special things they'd put inside the box.
[75:16.74]I could go get I have pac-man the new adventures too you know that goofy one where you tell pac-man to go go that way go that way and he's like blah I have not dude I'm not familiar with this one you have to play that game you're like middle manager to pac-man what's it called need to play this game and you need to scream it it's like the one of the funnest most ridiculous games ever made what's it wait don't you always tell pac-man where to go or are you just like some guy on the side this is pac-man 2 the new adventures for super Nintendo
[75:46.98]Okay, I'll check it out.
[75:48.75]They went a wildly different direction.
[75:51.77]So it's one of my favorites.
[75:53.47]It's probably in the top 20, top 30 games of all time.
[75:57.69]Oh, wow.
[75:58.45]I know Pac-Man has a genre, or Pac-Man has a character, but it's some random games.
[76:03.88]Have you ever played the Pac-Man 3D Adventure?
[76:07.32]Yeah, this one.
[76:07.86]On Xbox?
[76:08.62]This is kind of like that, but it is the weirdest game I think I've ever played.
[76:12.99]Oh, I'll check it out.
[76:14.23]I've never even heard about it.
[76:15.60]The whole game consists around you watching Pac-Man do, it's like, go, go get some milk at the store.
[76:22.33]That's the goal of the game.
[76:23.53]You don't control Pac-Man.
[76:25.25]You just yell at him.
[76:28.32]What?
[76:28.44]I swear to God.
[76:31.28]And he's stupid.
[76:32.44]You give him orders?
[76:33.80]You go, look, and there's a finger, you can do left, right, A, you can like throw shit at him, because if he's doing something stupid, he'll just be like, huh?
[76:45.07]I might play it again on stream at some point soon.
[76:47.73]You got to check it out though.
[76:48.81]It is a great game.
[76:49.35]I'll check it out.
[76:50.32]That sounds awesome.
[76:51.56]But the reason why I brought it up is because I have that box too.
[76:56.41]And it's so cool.
[76:57.15]It's got like a big hologram on the front.
[76:59.11]It's got a bunch of cute little things in it.
[77:01.07]It's like, oh, bring this.
[77:02.38]You can get like $5 in tokens from a Namco arcade or something.
[77:07.02]Yeah.
[77:08.18]And they're all so much cool artwork.
[77:09.55]They don't make them like they used to.
[77:11.01]Yeah, and when you weren't playing the game, you could just have the manual open and just read it and be obsessed with it.
[77:15.34]Yeah.
[77:15.50]I don't think that's a thing anymore.
[77:17.10]I mean, people don't even buy physical games, Jerma.
[77:20.33]Like, it's not even that.
[77:21.51]It's like, they don't even come with... It's all on Steam now.
[77:24.26]It's so impersonal.
[77:26.51]I got into, like, a collecting kick recently just to... And I'm not talking about, like, oh, I want the graded 9.5 plus, like, $6,000 cartridge.
[77:38.51]I just kind of want the cartridge.
[77:39.81]You know, I'll spend $50, $20, $10, right?
[77:44.64]Mm-hmm.
[77:44.80]Is that what I really, really want?
[77:45.96]Yeah, that's how I feel.
[77:47.42]Really badly?
[77:48.44]Yeah.
[77:49.75]Maybe I would spend a little bit of money on it, but I just kind of want them.
[77:54.17]Yeah.
[77:54.77]No, I get it.
[77:55.33]I know.
[77:56.33]I've entered that phase too.
[77:57.47]That's why I'm looking at these old disk covers.
[77:59.38]I'm like, damn, those are so fun.
[78:01.60]Should this count for the continues?
[78:04.42]Yes.
[78:04.72]Oh.
[78:05.86]Yeah, yeah.
[78:06.33]This should count as for continues.
[78:08.43]But yeah.
[78:10.47]I saw actually recently you have like an N64 box that you were playing recently.
[78:15.87]Uh... I forget.
[78:18.25]Like, an N64 collection?
[78:20.04]Yeah, I saw you had, like, some... Oh, yes!
[78:22.94]Oh, yeah, I played my, uh, childhood N64 collection, like, all of them, to review.
[78:28.25]And everyone's making fun of me because I only had, like, six games, but back then they were so expensive.
[78:33.40]Dude, having six games when you were, like, 12 is... Yeah, I know.
[78:38.66]I got it from my cousin.
[78:40.26]We gotta log in.
[78:42.79]And everyone's like, only six games?
[78:45.47]I remember 00 Goldeneye 007 was 80 bucks.
[78:48.53]It was $80 at launch.
[78:50.44]Oh my god.
[78:51.00]I know and it was so good though.
[78:53.14]It was just so revolutionary.
[78:53.88]And that's back in 1997.
[78:55.08]Uh oh.
[78:56.55]Yeah, so now it's like 120 bucks.
[78:58.35]Dude, you can't lose.
[78:59.19]You got game over?
[79:00.07]I got game over.
[79:00.79]Dude.
[79:01.27]Oh my god.
[79:01.83]Wait.
[79:02.39]Why?
[79:02.75]I think we used all of our continuous fucking run.
[79:05.76]Oh no.
[79:11.26]Are we going to have to play the whole game again?
[79:13.56]No, no, no, no.
[79:15.26]Alright, okay.
[79:18.27]Oh, I'll clutch, don't worry.
[79:19.91]Can I not press start?
[79:21.99]I actually have a game over.
[79:23.29]Oh, no.
[79:29.00]Dude, this run is so hard.
[79:36.11]What?
[79:39.02]Oh, good luck, dude.
[79:43.87]Okay, so we both get game over.
[79:45.08]Do we start at this level, I wonder?
[79:46.56]Or do we start the whole game over?
[79:47.80]Oh, please.
[79:48.54]I mean, we're about to find out.
[79:49.86]There's no way.
[79:53.32]I'm 1 HP.
[79:54.71]Oh, fuck.
[79:55.09]We're going to get game over.
[79:55.75]Hold on.
[79:59.93]It's over.
[80:00.93]Oh, God.
[80:02.27]Oh, no.
[80:08.78]Oh, my God.
[80:09.52]That actually is... We lost at the last enemy.
[80:12.32]No!
[80:15.11]hot we're just joking about the ghost pepper obviously oh wait why did that happen oh why did that happen because we ran out of continues I thought we had infinite that's why I was playing like an idiot I didn't even care that's so sad
[80:45.33]Well, we're both eating ghost peppers anyways.
[80:47.92]Right, right.
[80:48.38]We'll do it together.
[80:49.97]Go to versus.
[80:54.30]Are we still on the same screen?
[80:55.92]Or did it kick us?
[80:57.68]Oh no, we're on the same screen.
[81:00.85]Are we doing the whole game again?
[81:06.85]Alright, actually lock in for real.
[81:08.83]Okay, okay.
[81:09.63]Wait, is this a bad time to have to go to the bathroom?
[81:11.33]Because I can just hold it in the whole time and play more urgently.
[81:13.91]No, no, no, no, no.
[81:14.92]Definitely, we need to at peak.
[81:16.84]Urgently.
[81:17.62]No, no, no, I got you.
[81:18.30]I'll just play absolutely urgently.
[81:20.00]I think this is the way we should play.
[81:23.24]I can't believe we fucking lost.
[81:25.37]And we've talked all that shit.
[81:28.11]Yeah, we're like chit-chatting.
[81:29.35]I thought we were going to win for sure.
[81:31.11]Alright, we have to be very, very serious now.
[81:33.85]Okay, I'm going to bring back my Counter-Strike comms.
[81:35.61]I got the guy on the right.
[81:40.77]It's 45 minutes to get there.
[81:42.01]We'll be fine.
[81:43.31]Yeah, we're gonna... And now we're smart.
[81:45.33]I was opening up minion boxes.
[81:47.22]There was at least two or three deaths.
[81:48.90]Two or three continues that I did not care about.
[81:51.10]You did that during the last run?
[81:54.39]It didn't even pause?
[81:55.69]Yes.
[81:59.66]Are you sure that's it?
[82:00.50]That we ran out of continues?
[82:01.52]Or is it because I had zero...
[82:03.80]Like, have we been borrowing each other's lives or something?
[82:06.57]It's very possible that we've been stealing each other's stuff.
[82:09.15]Alright.
[82:09.45]I see you got crushed by that thing.
[82:11.57]You got to make sure you got to get... We got to do it.
[82:13.89]You got crushed again.
[82:15.05]This is a reset opportunity.
[82:16.80]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[82:18.68]I just did it as a joke.
[82:21.96]It crushes them as well.
[82:23.54]Are you going to fight?
[82:24.92]I'm just taking the corner.
[82:26.45]I don't want to be crushed by it.
[82:27.55]I got the health.
[82:29.59]Alright.
[82:29.81]We're good.
[82:30.05]We're good.
[82:30.35]We're good.
[82:30.59]We're fine.
[82:31.65]Okay.
[82:32.51]Oh man, he hits it already.
[82:34.93]He's just not logging in completely.
[82:37.37]I didn't even know that was going to explode.
[82:41.50]I got these guys.
[82:42.16]I got the pink guys right here.
[82:45.22]Okay, perfect.
[82:47.39]So why is a power attack, right?
[82:49.75]Yeah, but it uses health.
[82:51.63]Oh shit, I've been spamming why.
[82:53.79]If you hit somebody with it, it uses health.
[82:55.76]Okay, good to know.
[83:01.65]oh shit okay you take point here you take point alright be careful for those lasers oh my god you're almost dead again no I'm I uh but I killed so many people yeah there's another pizza coming up okay I don't like michelangelo's too slow but then you but you picked them I mean I changed my character too
[83:31.05]Is Raphael a good character?
[83:33.31]He's so fast, I like him.
[83:35.01]Oh shit, I just realized, we were betting that we were going to win in five continues there.
[83:38.53]But did that count?
[83:39.13]Because we weren't really, we didn't really... We thought we had infinite continues.
[83:43.50]I think that's a refund.
[83:44.50]Because, yeah, we had no idea.
[83:46.74]Yeah, it's a refund.
[83:47.62]We got it.
[83:48.73]Okay, we got it refunded.
[83:50.91]There's a new, will they beat the game?
[83:52.61]Okay.
[83:54.67]We got a new bet in here.
[83:56.90]Oh, now Baxter doesn't scare me after seeing that final boss.
[84:00.93]Oh, he hit me.
[84:04.15]Why is he?
[84:04.63]He's solo aiming me.
[84:06.60]You got to catch him on the after the shoot up.
[84:10.34]Oh, what a bad cycle that was.
[84:14.70]That was good.
[84:22.99]I don't know what to do with that hand thing.
[84:25.11]They just have to stay under him, right?
[84:26.52]I think you just get away from it, like go under him.
[84:29.38]Yeah.
[84:30.09]He's going to land.
[84:33.24]Oh, God, he hit us both.
[84:34.20]How did he do that?
[84:36.64]He's laughing.
[84:37.30]He's mocking us.
[84:39.87]I can't believe I'm playing.
[84:40.99]He hates us.
[84:44.27]He'll land again here.
[84:55.75]Alright, we got it.
[84:56.99]nice alright we didn't even lose a single life by the way that was so good yeah we got to keep it up because we especially at the prehistoric level it's really easy for us to get killed right and um uh there's no pausing for bathrooms right we just have to go all out
[85:15.49]Yeah, no bathroom pause.
[85:16.91]Yeah, okay, right, right.
[85:18.01]Just making sure.
[85:18.65]I don't have to... Well, I mean... Do you have to go?
[85:20.79]Because we could do an emergency bathroom pause.
[85:23.05]No, no, no, no.
[85:23.75]No, no, no.
[85:24.03]I'm totally fine.
[85:24.73]You don't have to worry about me.
[85:25.69]I'm not the liability.
[85:28.26]So, what's your favorite food?
[85:30.68]Oh, chicken tikka masala from Trader Joe's.
[85:34.16]What's my favorite food?
[85:35.68]I don't know.
[85:36.08]I'm going to have a boring answer, like pizza and a hot dog.
[85:39.53]That's good.
[85:41.03]That's what everyone says, though.
[85:42.29]I wish I had a more impressive one.
[85:46.28]When you were younger, did you ever do the yearbook thing?
[85:49.07]Where it was like, what's your favorite show?
[85:50.53]What's your favorite food?
[85:51.57]When you were younger.
[85:53.02]Oh, of course.
[85:54.98]And every single entry was pizza.
[85:57.60]It was like pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza.
[86:00.17]Every single person.
[86:00.95]Do you know what mine was?
[86:01.79]It was cool.
[86:02.63]What?
[86:04.78]Chicken and rice.
[86:10.45]That's such a kid pick-me answer.
[86:14.25]But you're telling me if you had a pizza and a chicken and rice, would you choose the chicken and rice over pizza?
[86:21.46]I mean, probably not, but I think I was just sitting there thinking about it.
[86:24.20]What do I like?
[86:25.22]Oh, I like chicken and rice.
[86:27.90]That's sweet, actually.
[86:29.87]That's good.
[86:30.33]That's good macros.
[86:33.33]I mean, I used to eat weird stuff.
[86:34.53]Like, I used to eat prunes.
[86:37.80]I still like prunes and V8.
[86:41.77]Like V8 tomato juice.
[86:43.21]V8's good.
[86:43.71]I'm there with you.
[86:45.17]Yeah, but people are going to be disgusted by that in your chat.
[86:48.55]People think V8 is the most disgusting thing ever.
[86:52.44]V8 is delicious.
[86:53.18]V8 is gross.
[86:54.14]V8 is delicious.
[86:55.26]My monitor's going to turn off.
[86:56.48]What?
[86:57.98]What?
[86:58.84]I just got a warning that was like, your monitor needs to turn off for maintenance.
[87:02.79]What the fuck was that?
[87:03.55]For maintenance.
[87:05.47]Now that's why I just got hit.
[87:07.91]Yeah, work.
[87:10.51]Don't touch that.
[87:11.03]Don't touch it.
[87:12.07]I touched it, Grandma.
[87:13.33]I'm a rebel.
[87:14.07]I'm a rebel.
[87:14.73]No, we have to beat this.
[87:16.67]Otherwise, we have to pretend to eat ghost peppers as a parody on stream in like a week.
[87:21.44]As a performance art.
[87:22.84]Alright, I need pizza.
[87:24.02]It's this one right here.
[87:24.88]Make sure I don't get hit.
[87:26.86]Yes, sir.
[87:27.95]Pizza up there.
[87:28.81]Excellent work.
[87:32.47]You know, I really respond well to positive reinforcement.
[87:38.13]Go ahead.
[87:40.91]You... It's so awesome when you pick up the pizzas that give you the superpowers way earlier than you're supposed to.
[87:51.03]Okay, that feels more like an insult, I would say, than positive... Like, okay, like... Alright, he does this... Oh, no, I hit Y. He does the shoot thing.
[88:00.06]I'm dead.
[88:01.20]He does the thing.
[88:01.76]You gotta be careful.
[88:02.29]He's gonna start shooting.
[88:03.03]Okay, okay, yeah, he's got the thing.
[88:05.55]Here he goes.
[88:05.91]Ready?
[88:06.13]Jump over it.
[88:08.42]Watch out he does the kicks.
[88:10.32]Oh, right, right, right And he finishes that up and then that cycles over he'll do it again after he takes another point of damage Who's this Malenia?
[88:16.53]Like how is she how is this person moving so well?
[88:19.53]I don't remember him doing the kick Kicks fuck I get hit by a kick.
[88:24.78]Oh he hit me he hit me hit me Yeah, I think metalhead might be your hardest boss in Elden Ring
[88:35.17]Who's metalhead?
[88:36.71]The guy we're fighting right now.
[88:39.93]Oh, him.
[88:43.98]Right.

[89:09.79]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[89:12.03]Oh, yeah, it's yellow.
[89:12.89]It makes me have to go to the bathroom even more.

[91:21.38]We took way too much damage with the Rat King.
[91:23.00]That was bad.
[91:23.54]No, it was fine.
[91:25.49]We didn't use a continue in our health resets.
[91:31.19]We took too much damage with the Rat King.
[91:33.11]Yeah, we did.
[91:33.80]And there's no pausing.
[91:34.62]I just want to reiterate for the bathroom breaks.
[91:37.44]You can go to the bathroom right now.
[91:40.79]No, there's no way I can go to the bathroom right now.
[91:42.52]You definitely can.
[91:43.14]Because as long as we don't move to the right, then you're fine.
[91:45.64]Oh, okay.
[91:45.94]Then I'll be right back literally two seconds.
[91:47.93]You're fine.
[91:48.45]As long as we don't move to the right, you're good.
[91:50.63]I won't move.
[91:51.20]I won't move.
[92:07.49]Dude, I can't wait to play, um, to do the ghost pepper thing with him.
[92:10.89]It's gonna be so fun.
[92:15.98]I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so prepared for that.
[92:20.53]There's gonna be the little ray in front of me with like two or three pickles or something.
[92:24.43]Or actually, I'm gonna get peppers.
[92:26.59]Hey, don't tell him.
[92:27.94]Literally don't tell him.
[92:29.16]But what if I actually... Don't fucking tell him.
[92:33.84]What if I actually just eat a real ghost pepper and it's not acting?
[92:37.59]And it's like, he's acting and I'm not.
[92:39.34]That's fucking hilarious.
[92:42.75]I eat a really hot pepper for real.
[92:46.38]That's next level.
[92:47.80]And then he can watch my clips back and be like, holy shit, he's even like sweating.
[92:51.19]This guy's an incredible actor.
[92:53.33]Oh, that's actually perfect.
[92:55.08]Don't tell him.
[93:02.94]But what if he does the same thing?
[93:04.46]Then we just both are doing this.
[93:06.02]He's not going to do that.
[93:07.59]He wants to act.
[93:22.46]Okay.
[93:23.92]Everybody clear comms.
[93:25.31]Clear comms in the chat.
[93:27.05]I'll eat him.
[93:28.99]Actually, he might come back.
[93:30.63]I don't want him to hear this.
[93:33.82]I'm back.
[93:34.86]Hey!
[93:37.15]We didn't move at all.
[93:40.07]Oh wait, did you just move?
[93:41.67]Oh, I thought you said you were ready.
[93:44.00]Oh yeah, I'm ready now.
[93:47.46]I'm ready, I'm ready.
[93:48.64]Alright, I'm going to turn the game up because I think it's fine.
[93:52.79]Hey, can you say ABCs for a second?
[93:54.83]A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P. Now go like Q, R, like a little louder.
[94:03.25]You just sang and said la- Q-R-S- Oh, okay.
[94:06.81]Sound good.
[94:09.12]Alright.
[94:09.78]There we go.
[94:10.18]Alright, let's go.
[94:12.44]I also, you know, every time I stream, I have a blanket on, so I need to- I just replaced my blanket with a more comfortable one, just FYI, I just don't wanna- Obviously, it's gonna be obvious, my vibe is gonna change.
[94:21.67]Playing with a blanket?
[94:23.35]No, I always have a blanket.
[94:25.01]Always.
[94:25.61]Is it chilly?
[94:27.60]I'm a little weird.
[94:29.18]I put the AC on and then I put a blanket on.
[94:32.13]I don't know how to explain this.
[94:33.17]Oh, you're one of these weirdos.
[94:34.65]You make your house old to then make yourself hot.
[94:40.78]Yes, yes, exactly.
[94:41.88]What is going on?
[94:43.06]And I'll have a warm cup of tea, a blanket, and a sweatshirt on, and it's summer.
[94:49.57]But my house is freezing.
[94:52.25]Okay, what temperature do you make your house?
[94:54.23]What's your ideal temperature range?
[94:57.07]Okay, well, I don't have, like, a temperature, like, a thermometer in my apartment.
[95:02.01]I have, like, a general AC unit.
[95:04.05]So it just has a cold button.
[95:06.20]So, but if I was to guess, it would be, like... Wait, this is a cold button?
[95:10.28]Yeah, like, it's a button you click that says cold.
[95:12.91]I swear to God.
[95:13.79]It doesn't have, like, the temperature.
[95:15.21]Are you in a hotel?
[95:17.03]No, no.
[95:18.05]A hotel has a thermometer.
[95:19.45]I live in New York City.
[95:21.29]Oh, but wait.
[95:22.08]It just says cold?
[95:22.96]You don't know how cold it is?
[95:24.36]It says cold.
[95:25.76]It says cold on.
[95:27.36]And it just spews cold air.
[95:31.99]Actually, that's kind of... That's kind of cool.
[95:35.51]Well, it makes it really cold, and then when you want it to be less cold, you turn it off.
[95:40.02]It's just that simple.
[95:41.32]You've got to bump into these guys.
[95:42.14]You've got to do the running thing into them.
[95:44.71]Oh.
[95:46.69]Here, you take them in one direction.
[95:49.44]Squeaks, pick up that.
[95:51.38]It's a thing.
[95:52.66]You should pick it up.
[95:53.24]Wait, pick it up?
[95:53.78]No!
[95:54.62]I was doing the thing that you said when you tell me to do something.
[95:56.71]I'm just listening.
[95:57.53]Okay, clear comms.
[95:59.63]You need to get all these kills, by the way.
[96:02.39]Easy.
[96:03.47]See?
[96:03.77]I am not fighting until you get a level up.
[96:06.20]Because you need it.
[96:07.58]I can handle it.
[96:10.16]You're fighting.
[96:11.22]Well, otherwise you're going to get overwhelmed.
[96:13.52]You're right.
[96:13.92]I'm just trying to act tough.
[96:16.72]We do it like League of Legends.
[96:18.56]You're the ADC.
[96:19.30]I'll let you get the last hit.
[96:22.22]Oops.
[96:25.03]Wait, this really is like League of Legends.
[96:26.27]Very important.
[96:26.95]This is hard.
[96:27.57]We gotta be careful here.
[96:28.55]This could be bad.
[96:30.54]They will bump into each other.
[96:32.48]I've got zero lives and I'm lit.
[96:36.07]I go turtle this time.
[96:39.23]Let them hit each other.
[96:40.99]Don't ever be next to them, perpendicular, whatever the fucking term is, for more than like a second.
[96:45.99]Hit and get out.
[96:46.80]Hit and get out.
[96:47.84]Because they will do that.
[96:48.64]See?
[96:49.10]They jump forward.
[96:49.86]Oh, I see, I see.
[96:51.02]Interesting.
[96:51.86]Okay.
[96:53.60]Especially if you see them do like a hop back, they're going to slash forward very quickly.
[96:57.27]Oh!
[97:00.73]Oh, and they run into each other.
[97:04.82]That's good.
[97:06.06]Oh!
[97:06.50]It's electricity!
[97:10.23]He's hurt.
[97:10.69]He's hurt.
[97:17.13]We killed him.
[97:19.94]We didn't die.
[97:20.58]That was awesome.
[97:21.64]I'm not afraid to say it.
[97:22.98]W. Yeah, you're right.
[97:28.35]We did good.
[97:31.91]Oh, my God.
[97:32.35]I took a sip of coffee at the worst time.
[97:34.85]Alright, so you need to get some more kills.
[97:36.51]We need to get you with a level up.
[97:38.37]You need to get a life up.
[97:39.33]Okay, okay.
[97:40.03]Roger that.
[97:40.41]I got the guys on the right.
[97:41.68]You should get the guys on the left as well.
[97:43.12]Okay, I got the... Oh, shoot.
[97:45.46]I've never seen that animation.
[97:48.24]That's so pathetic looking.
[97:51.01]I was swatted out of the air like a freaking insect.
[97:55.53]I think... Is it 150 or 200 you get a life up?
[97:58.52]I actually get one right now.
[98:03.69]I hate these things.
[98:04.99]They're bad.
[98:05.63]I'm dead, Jerma!
[98:06.77]I'm dead before I get 150!
[98:09.82]Oh, I'm using a continue.
[98:11.14]Alright, pick a character you're good with.
[98:14.55]Okay.
[98:19.76]I picked the same character, but I just feel like I got unlucky last time.
[98:24.08]I think you're doing fine.
[98:24.80]I think you'll be fine.
[98:26.25]Okay, thank you.
[98:34.90]Alright, we're in not bad shape.
[98:36.61]I think we've used like four or five continues at this point.
[98:39.87]Yeah, and now we've only used one.
[98:41.95]This is way better.
[98:42.81]And no minion labubu openings.
[98:46.18]Oh yeah, I forgot I had those.
[98:49.82]Yeah, I mean, you got labubu brain.
[98:52.62]What character is this?
[98:55.60]Is this like a different... I've never heard of that one.
[98:57.19]Alright, remember, throw in to the... We can get this one really quickly.
[99:00.91]Throw it into the screen.
[99:02.35]Okay.
[99:02.55]Okay.
[99:06.70]Oh, careful.
[99:08.18]He's moving the screen around way too much.
[99:09.52]He's getting a bad pull here.
[99:11.10]I'm getting nausea.
[99:11.80]I'm getting nausea.
[99:14.33]Oh.
[99:14.41]Here we go.
[99:17.89]Wait, how do you pick them up?
[99:19.13]I'm close to him and I'm hitting X. You got to be right up on them.
[99:22.67]Okay, I see.
[99:23.29]Like intersecting hitboxes, I guess.
[99:26.02]Yeah, you have to be like in their hitbox.
[99:28.10]Okay.
[99:29.42]I got shot.
[99:35.03]Alright, I'm doing... Did you stay left?
[99:37.22]I got him.
[99:38.12]Oh, I got one!
[99:39.67]Hooray!
[99:40.23]And that'll do it.
[99:48.56]There you go.
[99:48.86]Alright, we're good.
[99:50.42]I got one.
[99:50.76]Only one continuum.
[99:51.40]We're going to time travel.
[99:53.11]Alright, nice work.
[99:57.87]My patience is wearing thin.
[99:59.98]I'm banishing you to a time warp from which you will never return.
[100:05.22]Oh, it was Cactus Cooler, by the way, is the drink that I'm drinking.
[100:10.00]I've never heard of Cactus Cooler before.
[100:13.27]It's pretty damn good.
[100:14.81]I would have never guessed that.
[100:17.17]Wait, is it like a soda?
[100:18.69]A soda.
[100:19.32]I don't drink that much soda anymore.
[100:20.62]I probably have like one or two sodas a month at this point.
[100:25.96]That's pretty good.
[100:26.72]And in terms of tier list of sodas, Cactus Cooler is your favorite?
[100:30.03]It's climbing because it's like an orange pineapple.
[100:33.17]It's pretty great.
[100:33.73]Oh, that sounds awesome.
[100:35.71]What's the other soda that you have?
[100:38.26]Like in terms of Cheerless, what's your faves?
[100:41.60]I think Cherry Coke is probably number one.
[100:45.92]Vanilla Coke.
[100:47.93]Vanilla Coke from like 20 years ago would be number one, but it's different now.
[100:53.15]Oh, really?
[100:53.51]They changed the recipe?
[100:54.87]It just doesn't taste the same to me.
[101:00.32]That's true.
[101:00.62]The older I get, the more I am sensitive to sweets.
[101:06.88]What about Dr. Pepper?
[101:07.96]You don't like Dr. Pepper?
[101:09.56]Dude, Dr. Pepper used to be a piece of my identity on my channel 15 years ago.
[101:18.88]But then what happened?
[101:19.62]You had a falling out with the doctor?
[101:21.46]I don't know why it was in the first place.
[101:25.15]Wait, what?
[101:25.73]You faked a Dr. Pepper?
[101:28.31]No, I loved it.
[101:29.77]But I would drink it on camera and be like, oh, Dr. Pepper time!
[101:32.70]I don't know.
[101:33.82]I was weird about it.
[101:37.12]Yeah, but then something changed.
[101:38.38]Clearly you had some, you know, probably like a weird interaction or something.
[101:48.20]God, I feel like I'm doing so well and I get like 32 kills.
[101:52.07]You gotta get the last hits.
[101:55.23]I'll let you get some more kills.
[101:56.09]You need the health.
[101:56.92]Okay.
[101:57.30]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[101:57.94]Big guys, big guys.
[101:58.70]These guys are worth a lot.
[102:04.41]Oh, I need, you, you last did that.
[102:06.71]You ran away.
[102:08.17]Watch out, he's gonna charge.
[102:08.85]I need, no, there we go.
[102:12.92]Oh.
[102:17.28]Oh no, they hit so hard.
[102:19.54]Alright, get this guy, this guy's ready.
[102:24.11]There we go.
[102:30.29]But I've been collecting Atari games too, and like colloquial vision games.
[102:35.10]Do you have an Atari?
[102:37.81]I do.
[102:39.67]Do you know they remade the original Atari to go into HDMI?
[102:43.91]That's the one that I have.
[102:45.80]Oh, me too.
[102:46.46]I actually played Pong on it recently with the classic controller.
[102:52.14]Hold off on that.
[102:53.47]Don't touch it.
[102:55.25]I'm going to get so many kills all at once.
[102:58.07]You're going to use that against the big guys.
[103:00.15]There's a bunch of big guys come out soon and you're going to use it and kill them very quickly.
[103:04.04]Not yet.
[103:05.02]Hold.
[103:06.06]Oh, I can't wait.
[103:06.82]Okay, hold.
[103:09.24]Holding.
[103:09.93]And touch it.
[103:11.51]Don't let it go.
[103:12.15]Touch it now.
[103:14.11]What the fuck just happened?
[103:16.33]What happened?
[103:18.10]I thought you touched it.
[103:19.70]No, you moved a little too quick there.
[103:22.76]I thought your character touched it.
[103:26.61]I was so excited.
[103:28.43]That's so sad.
[103:30.05]We don't need it.
[103:31.21]I'm glad you didn't get a rare minion, Labubu.
[103:34.76]I got the rare... Oh my god, you're dying.
[103:38.40]I got the rare socks from the saw thing.
[103:41.35]I'm way happier about that.
[103:42.33]Listen, everybody watching knew you wanted the rare minion.
[103:46.27]I did.
[103:47.22]I don't even know what it was called.
[103:50.64]Oh my god.
[103:51.74]Okay, no more minion talk.

[105:17.32]Okay, we're good.
[105:19.26]yes good job okay wait that went pretty well that went better than last time we did not lose a life that's perfect let's freaking go cowabunga hey can you say can you give the right to butt chugging too I don't own the rights to butt chugging what a weird comment I thought you held a patent
[105:46.69]Yeah, what, the patent on butt chugging a certain way?
[105:49.39]What does that even mean?
[105:50.11]Isn't it called boofing?
[105:53.52]I don't, I don't know.
[105:54.80]Oh, okay.
[105:55.94]Me neither.
[106:00.13]Why did you read that one?
[106:01.23]Because I was right there.
[106:02.39]It was staring at me.
[106:05.49]I had to read it.
[106:05.97]You don't filter it in your head before you read it out loud?
[106:08.26]I mean, I filter it.
[106:10.52]Like, when you're reading a chat message, Jeremiah, do you, like, just, like, you just read it before thinking?
[106:15.71]Mm-hmm.
[106:17.08]Sometimes.
[106:19.20]Yeah, me too.
[106:19.90]Oh, careful on the things on the floor.
[106:21.32]They hurt you.
[106:24.15]Watch out for those arches.
[106:29.90]Dude, I'm so excited for this parody ghost pepper stream.
[106:33.66]Me too, me too, actually.
[106:35.70]Me too.
[106:36.14]I'm going to wear my best t-shirt.
[106:38.49]It's going to be really exciting.
[106:40.31]Oh, careful.
[106:41.07]There's one in the middle.
[106:42.13]Yeah, and you're probably going to do the same thing I'm doing, right?
[106:44.70]What's your setup going to be?
[106:46.98]I'm gonna sit there on like a full cam on a desk, a table, and I'm gonna have like, I was thinking like a marker or something where I could write every pepper that I'm gonna try and put it on like a tier list.
[106:58.94]And then we start from lowest and go to highest.
[107:01.56]Oh, wait, so you wanted, I thought, okay, so you're doing multiple peppers parody.
[107:06.41]Yeah, and then it goes increasingly hot.
[107:08.63]So, like, because I want whoever the casting agent to be to know that I can fake, like, light spice and heavy spice.
[107:15.90]Like, I want to show the full range of react.
[107:18.74]I was going to do this, like, the ghost pepper.
[107:20.44]I'm just going ghost pepper, and that's it.
[107:22.89]And I'm just going crazy.
[107:24.09]Oh, my God.
[107:24.83]Don't you think that performance is a little one-dimensional?
[107:27.47]We did the same thing last time when we lost, like, three continues.
[107:31.06]You're right, you're right.
[107:31.76]I already... We already did two continues.
[107:34.14]Alright, leave that.
[107:36.48]Oh, it's... Okay.
[107:38.23]And hold.
[107:39.79]Holding?
[107:40.91]We'll use it in a minute.
[107:46.67]In a second.
[107:47.10]Oh, these arrow guys are noobs.
[107:48.46]And... Oh, you're gonna take it this time.
[107:50.68]Okay.
[107:52.46]There we go.
[107:52.92]I just cleared the whole screen.
[107:56.35]Maybe there's, like, lag.
[107:57.13]I didn't see that many people on the screen, but nice.
[107:59.99]Maybe...
[108:02.24]Must be that frame thing you were talking about.
[108:03.38]So you're going to do the whole tier list thing.
[108:04.67]That's actually a pretty good idea.
[108:06.89]Yeah, just so that I could, you know, it's a range of acting.
[108:10.86]You can steal it.
[108:11.32]You're going to be in 30 minutes?
[108:13.48]No, I'm going to probably take hours for this.
[108:16.57]I don't want to do a shoddy job.
[108:19.91]I was thinking we just both take a bite and we have to do a react to the bite.
[108:25.50]okay deal at the same time yeah that's like the very same time it's like okay here we are like I've got my setup squeaks has got his setup wait should we even acknowledge each other or just like a coincidence that we did this together at the same time we ban each other's names as terms from the chat like we're like insecurely doing a ghost pepper this is a good idea actually we just don't bring it up
[108:50.76]Wait, wait, we need to discuss what you're going to look like.
[108:53.86]Like, what is the ghost pepper going to look like?
[108:56.43]You just go to the grocery store and get like a red looking pepper.
[109:01.13]Just any red pepper?
[109:02.54]I'm going to get like a bell pepper.
[109:04.26]Get a bell pepper and cut it up so it looks weird and then just say that's what it is.
[109:08.39]Okay.
[109:09.13]Well, I think you have to go all out.
[109:10.77]So like, let's make sure we like package it correctly, too.
[109:14.69]Like, we can get some artists to commission packaging or something so it looks legit.
[109:19.37]And call it, like, some, like, streamer challenge, like, on the packet itself.
[109:24.94]The streamer challenge.
[109:27.22]Yes, like nuclear red.
[109:30.57]We did really good.
[109:31.53]No, we're doing fine.
[109:32.41]I think we're going to beat the game this time for sure.
[109:34.41]We're going to use all of our continues at Shredder.
[109:36.15]He's really hard.
[109:37.65]Yeah.
[109:37.77]Oh, by the way, when we do this ghost pepper challenge, you have to put drops in your title, too.
[109:42.99]it has to be a fake sponsor like you can get ghost pepper drops I think that would go really hard uh yeah spot like we I sponsored you and you sponsored me sponsored by Jerma985 in the corner I already did that to Ster by the way oh you did I sent him a PlayStation 5 and like the terms of this he just said it was like he calls himself a Jerma partner now
[110:10.98]I made him play Demon's Souls.
[110:13.98]Oh, dude, the remake or whatever?
[110:16.61]Yeah.
[110:16.95]Dude, I need to play that.
[110:18.21]I have it.
[110:19.01]I just have never beaten that.
[110:21.37]It's so good.
[110:23.36]You're either going to love it or you're going to hate it.
[110:25.92]I mean, I love all Souls games like that from SoftMakes.
[110:30.84]Demon's Souls is one of the best looking games I think I've ever seen.
[110:34.67]Like, at least on PlayStation.
[110:35.83]It is the prettiest game I've ever played.
[110:38.45]The remake or just the original?
[110:40.13]The remake.
[110:41.69]Oh, I'm excited.
[110:42.75]I know all my friends who've played it love it.
[110:45.92]The remake looks so bad.
[110:47.08]I don't, I don't even, okay.
[110:49.06]Everybody that talks about how they hate the remake, they always start with, hey, I will say the remake, I don't like the art style, but it's very pretty.
[110:57.45]I hate that.
[111:01.50]You can say the gameplay is bad if you want, but that game is, it is beautiful.
[111:08.02]People were complaining about the new Oblivion remake.
[111:11.19]The look of it.
[111:12.68]But it looks so good to me.
[111:14.05]As someone who loved the original.
[111:15.41]I don't know.
[111:17.60]Do you prefer the original or the remake?
[111:19.61]To me, they're in different categories.
[111:21.87]Totally different categories.
[111:23.09]A good comparison is if you look at Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 versus modern coaster games, it's like those are going for totally different things, but they both have their charm.
[111:34.85]I prefer the old-looking Roller Coaster Tycoon, but they've never released something like that now.
[111:39.90]They're trying to make it 3D and make it on Unreal Engine or something.
[111:44.32]Leave that pizza until we need it.
[111:46.63]Roger.
[111:47.05]Oh, shoot.
[111:49.13]I agree, though.
[111:49.90]I think that you need it.
[111:50.80]You should get it.
[111:53.08]That did so much damage.
[111:54.37]It did so much damage.
[111:55.11]That's crazy.
[111:56.09]Just the barrel?
[111:57.41]Jesus.
[112:02.15]But yeah, I think they both...
[112:05.55]they they like kind of split right it's like Demon's Souls the original is there as Demon's Souls and then there's like an arrow that moves down and it's like the remake is down there too like underneath it the original will always be the original it's in a completely different place in my brain the remake is just kind of under there as like another thing yeah yeah like it's not even competing no it's not it's like grayed out sometimes you'll crave the original sometimes you'll crave the remake I get that
[112:36.44]I just took damage.
[112:38.39]Okay, I need to stay smart.
[112:42.81]Actually, let's do this now.
[112:47.92]Oh, you can interrupt their charge?
[112:49.54]I think if you charge them.
[112:50.42]I don't know what the frame priority is, but... Oh, my God.
[112:53.26]Dude, the barrel.
[112:54.98]Oh, boy, Squeaks.
[112:55.93]It does so much damage.
[112:57.49]That's continue number three.
[113:01.15]Yeah, but we've got to have like 10 continues, right?
[113:04.39]And I was spitting the anoint at you, and I just got hurt.
[113:07.92]Come on.
[113:10.02]Alright, leave that piece.
[113:10.80]Wait, let's take that.
[113:13.95]Wait, you actually get it because you need the points.
[113:15.79]It's one point.
[113:17.23]No, we should have left it.
[113:19.10]Oh, I see.
[113:22.02]Oh, goody.
[113:22.68]Fresh turtle.
[113:25.12]Oh, careful.
[113:28.19]How is he so fast?
[113:33.57]Dude, the turtles rogues gallery is actually pretty great.
[113:38.13]No, he hit me twice.
[113:49.21]That was really good.
[113:50.57]Alright, do you think that who would win in a fight?
[113:53.59]All the turtles rogues gallery or all Spider-Man rogues gallery?
[113:59.28]The rogues gallery?
[114:00.56]What's a rogues gallery?
[114:02.14]All the villains.
[114:03.43]Oh, oh, oh.
[114:04.38]Let me think.
[114:08.20]I think Shredder kills half of the Spider-Man villains.
[114:11.40]Well, if it's Shredder from this game, if it's Shredder from the game... Okay, I think Spider-Man wins.
[114:18.87]I think Spider-Man would win, but Shredder would... It would be like... Oh, one versus... Could you think of 100 ducks or one horse-sized duck?
[114:27.38]I think Shredder would be... It would be easy for at least 50 people.
[114:32.71]Okay, who do you think wins?
[114:33.87]Shredder versus Venom?
[114:36.30]Oh, fuck.
[114:38.28]Yeah, checkmate.
[114:41.17]Probably Venom.
[114:43.17]There you go.
[114:44.99]But, I mean, who... Yeah, it would be easily Venom.
[114:49.12]I don't know, man.
[114:49.80]Shredder is, in canon, he's, like, stronger than... He's pretty strong.
[114:56.91]Yeah, that's true.
[114:57.63]I mean, he would absolutely destroy the Green Goblin, that's for sure.
[115:00.32]Shredder got killed by a garbage truck?
[115:02.58]That was... But, okay.
[115:05.76]Wait, true.
[115:10.21]Wait, true.
[115:10.91]He did get killed by a garbage truck.
[115:12.43]Yeah, he did.
[115:13.47]Wait a second.
[115:14.80]Where's the thing of Shredder in the game?
[115:16.50]We're no garbage truck, Jerma.
[115:18.22]We can't do it.
[115:22.80]Oh my god, that whole argument's out the window then.
[115:25.62]Yeah, now it's over.
[115:26.46]Alright, just jump, jump, just be aware.
[115:29.20]Right.
[115:30.14]There's a lot of pizzas that show up here soon.
[115:34.87]Oh, Jeremy, you gotta jump.
[115:38.67]Oh, are you kidding me?
[115:39.81]I landed, I... Nice, dude.
[115:42.00]So unlucky.
[115:42.50]We're good.
[115:49.04]Nice.
[115:50.62]Wait, we're good.
[115:51.93]We're such a good team now.
[115:53.21]We're almost... This is the last level coming up here.
[115:55.53]Yeah, we caught up so quick.
[115:59.39]And we're three continues down because... Somebody... No, say it.
[116:05.10]Somebody got hit a few times.
[116:07.62]Krang might be able to take on people.
[116:10.96]Yeah, but you know, like, you're as strong as your weakest player.
[116:14.51]So... We, as a collective team, there's no you and me, it's us.
[116:19.95]That's true, but I don't know.
[116:20.81]Krang versus Venom.
[116:23.88]I feel like Krang might actually... Oh, Krang.
[116:29.95]Oh, shoot.
[116:30.61]Dude, somebody queue him up in Mugen.
[116:31.91]We'll see.
[116:38.16]Krang is a freak.
[116:42.96]Oh, I'm missing.
[116:44.58]Watch those bombs.
[116:48.25]Bombs incoming.
[116:50.90]We haven't seen him do the woop woop woop woop thing yet.
[116:55.01]Good RNG.
[116:55.73]I feel like if you just stay on the bottom frame, you're just invincible to him.
[117:00.56]Like, what is he gonna do?
[117:01.32]He never goes low.
[117:03.88]Shit.
[117:04.68]Oh, shoot.
[117:10.29]There he goes.
[117:10.91]Oh, you're... Oh my god, we dodged it perfectly.
[117:20.38]There we go.
[117:20.96]Alright, we're good.
[117:22.53]Wait, we crushed that.
[117:23.53]Didn't we do, like, no hit?
[117:25.87]That was really good.
[117:28.51]You are gonna be... Alright.
[117:35.00]I don't know how many continues we have, but we have at least a few.
[117:39.13]Okay, and we're gonna use none of them.
[117:41.13]First, we're gonna do it in one life.
[117:43.15]just be crying is annoying when you fight like little blob crying just be aware of the bombs and then we gotta fight shredder uh mods put up a pretty cowabunga where no turtle has gone before I always do this I always put my face I'm I'm such an idiot dude what'd you do no nothing did you pee
[118:07.14]What?
[118:07.64]Oh, I peed.
[118:08.24]Oh, yeah, I peed.
[118:09.65]I definitely peed.
[118:10.43]I don't know why that was so weird.
[118:14.35]I'm like being interrogated.
[118:16.39]No, officer, I definitely peed.
[118:18.12]You don't have to worry about me.
[118:20.32]Are you sure about that?
[118:21.76]No, I... Well, yeah.
[118:30.07]Remember, it's good to do the X and Y together.
[118:33.90]If you know you... Losing one point...
[118:37.72]Losing one point of damage is better than losing, like, seven.
[118:41.19]Okay, true.
[118:41.85]Like, it's a bailout button.
[118:43.25]Oh.
[118:47.96]Dude, these guys are so tanky.
[118:50.16]Alright, who would win?
[118:50.70]Tell me when to get this.
[118:52.83]Uh, not yet.
[118:54.73]After this group?
[118:55.87]No.
[118:57.40]Oh my god.
[118:59.44]I didn't trust that you would do it right.
[119:02.26]sorry I didn't I was mean that's something to work on I didn't think I was trustworthy uh I hate when they're off screen okay if we're unable to beat the final boss are you right now willing to play this a third time no I mean well uh I this is what I love this game I can play this game in my sleep for 100 hours
[119:28.80]But there are other games we could play.
[119:31.13]So, we have to do it now.
[119:33.09]Oh, true, true, true.
[119:34.35]It's do or die.
[119:35.47]We've got the Tournament Fighters game to play.
[119:36.99]We've got the NES one.
[119:39.20]I want to play the NES game with you.
[119:40.88]That's a huge one.
[119:44.61]This is the only game I'm familiar with.
[119:46.25]And that was just on arcade.
[119:47.61]Where I would just hit random buttons.
[119:49.93]Alright, here we go.
[119:50.64]Careful.
[119:52.50]I'm already lit.
[119:53.80]I need this, I need this.
[119:56.04]Watch the floor.
[119:58.46]Watch the floor.
[119:59.08]Watch the floor.
[120:11.47]Oh my god.
[120:12.21]Knock it back.
[120:16.04]Alright, hoping for a pizza.
[120:24.97]Nice.
[120:28.66]Get that shit out of here.
[120:31.80]Oh my gosh.
[120:33.74]He just ran from off screen.
[120:35.18]I had no time to react.
[120:36.74]Oh no.
[120:42.39]That was bad.
[120:43.59]This is kind of bad.
[120:44.81]I'm kind of getting owned.
[120:45.89]I'm getting owned.
[120:47.03]Okay.
[120:47.39]We're alright.
[120:50.42]There's a pizza probably coming up.
[120:51.48]You need to get it.
[120:52.70]Clutch time.
[120:53.28]Clutch time.
[120:58.14]Okay.
[120:58.71]Oh no, Jerma.
[121:00.19]I have to use a continue.
[121:04.98]Let the record show I haven't used one continue.
[121:08.34]Good job.
[121:09.48]Wow.
[121:13.53]Let the record show Jerma is also up by a minion and saw socks versus zero from Squeaks because I was unable to buy it because the person working there said it was cute.
[121:25.96]Okay, wait.
[121:27.43]Tell me when to get it.
[121:33.49]Watch out for the lasers.
[121:35.98]Those guys are bait.
[121:37.32]Those guys are usually bait because, yeah, you can kill them, but you'll get hurt.
[121:41.38]Oh, the bomb hurts each other.
[121:43.62]Interesting.
[121:45.23]Oh, it was not in the hitbox.
[121:48.53]How did that hit me?
[121:50.70]That must be game lag, I swear.
[121:52.21]So help me God.
[121:53.19]I wasn't even close.
[121:54.45]Alright, hold on.
[121:55.49]We need to save that.
[121:57.49]Okay.
[122:01.39]Because one of us is going to desperately need that and it's going to be at Krang here.
[122:05.36]Alright, you ready?
[122:06.96]Or it might even be now because depending on how bad this goes.
[122:13.71]Nice.
[122:15.15]Oh boy.
[122:19.59]Oh, good dodge.
[122:21.18]Alright.
[122:22.58]You need that, Jerma?
[122:23.58]I think you need that.
[122:24.36]Yeah, I'll take it.
[122:25.34]Alright.
[122:25.68]Here we go.
[122:27.37]This is big.
[122:27.73]Big deal.
[122:28.57]This is the run.
[122:31.69]You can only hit him a few times and then he does this shit.
[122:34.01]I'm not gonna get greedy.
[122:37.10]Don't know how that didn't hit me.
[122:39.14]Honestly, it's easier to jump and hit him.
[122:41.64]He does the thing where he drops the shit on the ground.
[122:45.07]Oh, if you're above him?
[122:45.93]That's probably smart.
[122:55.94]Nice.
[122:56.56]Here comes the... He's gonna do the dropping the little robot soon.
[123:01.21]Big mistake.
[123:04.31]He laughed at you.
[123:05.94]He's a dick.
[123:07.92]Oh, shit.
[123:10.26]I think you can actually stop him from doing it by hurting him.
[123:14.03]Oh, there's an interrupt.
[123:16.27]Because after three hits, he disappears.
[123:22.18]Oh...
[123:31.08]Okay, we're alright.
[123:37.22]Oh, he Slammo's the ground!
[123:39.35]Okay, this is new.
[123:42.99]Alright, last cycle here, and we got it.
[123:47.44]Okay.
[123:48.34]We did it!
[123:49.84]Lock in.
[123:53.27]Wait, what do you mean, lock in?
[123:54.79]Zip.
[124:01.45]It's time.
[124:04.61]It's time.
[124:05.72]I'm ready.
[124:11.48]Cowabunga!
[124:14.25]Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[124:16.41]Okay.
[124:17.55]I'm going to blast the music for this.
[124:20.30]Let's turn it up a little bit here.
[124:23.12]Okay, I'm ready.
[124:26.03]Play with all of your might.
[124:28.81]I'm fully focused.
[124:29.69]I'm leaning in.
[124:42.07]He's targeting me.
[124:44.01]Alright, back up.
[124:51.44]Oh, no.
[124:54.40]Got to catch him in one.
[124:58.33]Got it.
[125:07.78]Oh, he shoots up.
[125:13.93]let him come at us a little bit oh shoot I jumped into his fire
[125:44.78]Alright.
[125:45.96]Here we go.
[125:46.44]Okay.
[125:49.52]Alright.
[125:49.90]Hold on.
[125:50.34]Hold on.
[125:52.13]What do you mean?
[125:52.83]The stack... Oh, we did it!
[125:56.23]Is that it?
[125:58.38]Cowabunga!
[126:02.10]Excuse me.
[126:08.63]We did it?
[126:09.93]Wait, isn't... Super Shredder.
[126:13.63]Oh, it has to be on hard mode.
[126:15.52]Oh, so we have to restart?
[126:25.23]He's laughing at us.
[126:27.42]I forgot that there's a hard mode.
[126:31.34]Let's go one more time.
[126:32.22]I'm just kidding.
[126:34.10]Listen, we did so well on this.
[126:36.57]Don't you think we could beat Super Shredder?
[126:39.03]That was not hard at all.
[126:40.03]I think we could beat Super Shredder, but hard is going to be hard.
[126:42.83]I think we only had one or two continues left.
[126:48.18]I mean, I felt very confident.
[126:49.84]That last battle, I played out of my mind.
[126:51.97]I don't think I could do much better than that.
[126:53.63]I didn't die a single time.
[126:55.11]Okay.
[126:56.37]I want to do one more thing here.
[126:58.02]Go to Versus.
[127:02.18]Versus.
[127:06.20]Yeah, old-school hard mode is actually hard hard, yeah.
[127:09.50]Wait, are you gonna, like, try to beat me up?
[127:12.01]I sure am.
[127:14.73]You wish.
[127:22.12]Oh!
[127:23.04]Oh!
[127:23.40]Oh!
[127:24.10]You gotta be fast!
[127:25.18]Oh!
[127:25.62]You gotta be fast!
[127:29.17]Okay, you're spamming.
[127:43.83]How do you grab so quick?
[127:45.55]Oh.
[127:50.36]Okay, let's do one more.
[127:51.36]Let's do one more try.
[127:52.58]One more try.
[127:57.70]Alright, you want to go ahead again?
[127:59.52]Yeah, yeah, 100%.
[128:00.27]I got so unlucky there.
[128:11.54]How are you doing that?
[128:13.61]Oh, wait!
[128:14.45]Oh, right, you can block!
[128:26.03]Oh, shoot.
[128:27.25]Okay, okay, one more time, one more time.
[128:29.08]Alright, one more.
[128:36.91]Okay, here we go.
[128:40.47]Teenage Mutant Ninja Tekken.
[128:45.37]Wait, isn't there a fighting game of this game as well, or am I just making that up?
[128:49.24]Um, there is and we're gonna play it.
[128:52.52]Oh man, I'm getting owned.
[129:02.62]Okay.
[129:10.93]What?!
[129:11.41]How do you throw?!
[129:12.13]!
[129:15.98]How do you throw?
[129:16.86]I swear I'm trying to... Okay, this one for sure.
[129:19.27]This one for sure.
[129:29.04]Oh my god, I'm the purple guy.
[129:30.88]I haven't hit you a single time.
[129:33.56]There we go.
[129:38.92]How did he not hear that?
[129:40.67]Why did you not hear that?
[129:42.73]I don't hear any... What do you mean?
[129:44.07]Did anybody hear that?
[129:44.61]I didn't hear anything.
[129:48.45]No?
[129:49.35]I don't think so.
[129:50.09]I burped into the microphone like a weirdo.
[129:53.20]I didn't hear it.
[129:53.74]Oh, that was so close.
[129:57.67]The compressor turned it off?
[129:59.85]Oh, okay.
[130:00.05]Oh, on Discord there's a compressor.
[130:01.75]Oh, did you want me to react to your burp?
[130:04.44]Were you disappointed that I didn't go, Jerma.
[130:07.04]Oh, Jerma.
[130:08.48]That's disgusting.
[130:09.65]Usually people go, ew.
[130:12.23]Ew, ew.
[130:13.01]I didn't react.
[130:13.63]I didn't hear it.
[130:14.21]I swear I would have reacted.
[130:16.13]Alright, so do you want to do the NES Ninja Turtles game, or Tournament Fighters, which is a fighting game?
[130:28.68]Let's do the NES one, because now I'm excited about it.
[130:34.42]It's awesome.
[130:35.87]That's one of my favorite games of all time.
[130:37.75]I'm excited.
[130:38.37]How do we go back?
[130:40.63]I think we just quit this.
[130:41.53]I hit one player.
[130:44.29]So if you quit that and then go to... Where is it?
[130:49.94]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[130:54.48]Okay, wait.
[130:54.94]Jerma, now that we've beaten this, and you haven't beaten this in a long time, you have to give it a review.
[131:04.54]It looks like they only have the third game.
[131:07.78]They don't have the... Which is fine.
[131:09.68]We can still play it.
[131:11.22]Okay, perfect.
[131:12.55]It's called The Manhattan Project.
[131:18.67]Because my review would be Cowabunga.
[131:21.97]Yeah, what would you rate what we just played out of 10?
[131:25.29]Sorry, say that again.
[131:26.75]I just completely ignored you.
[131:29.76]I'm sorry.
[131:30.26]It's the music turned on and I was like, where's the game?
[131:32.56]No, I get it.
[131:33.26]I understand.
[131:34.30]Ask me a question again.
[131:36.95]It's fine.
[131:37.71]It was... No, I want to answer it.
[131:39.61]What was it?
[131:40.15]No, I shouldn't have asked.
[131:41.39]I always... I'm just overstepping.
[131:43.35]No, I want to know.
[131:44.21]It's a perfect game for you.
[131:45.43]It's a perfect game for you.
[131:47.28]Message received.
[131:48.94]Basically, what I was asking was if you had to review it now, now that you've beaten it, what would you give it?
[131:53.14]A 10.
[131:53.78]Always.
[131:57.45]Okay, now ask me.
[131:59.29]What would you give it?
[132:00.51]Cowabunga out of 10.
[132:02.73]Oh, I get it.
[132:08.74]Oh, look, the turtles are enjoying the vacation on a beach.
[132:11.62]By the way, I've already made this joke, but I want to tell you it too.
[132:14.96]Watch what happens right now.
[132:20.80]Come on, April, write April's report.
[132:23.90]Right?
[132:25.88]Just wait.
[132:33.51]Oh, that's an awful sound.
[132:37.62]Treader took over every television.
[132:41.82]Oh, my God.
[132:42.70]By the way, he does this every single time he ever does anything bad.
[132:48.31]That TV?
[132:49.51]Yeah, that TV was not connected to anything.
[132:52.79]Holy shit.
[132:54.78]No, and he's taking April.
[133:02.25]Okay, I thought that was going to be way worse.
[133:06.61]Okay, that's fine.
[133:07.89]Alright, scene one.
[133:09.46]Let's go, Turtles.
[133:10.36]The start of a long... Can't read that fast.
[133:13.52]Alright, I'm going to be... I'll be Michelangelo.
[133:18.55]Okay, so this is just the old game, but with worse graphics?
[133:23.03]Effectively, this is not the one that I wanted to play.
[133:25.47]The other one, it's on the collection, but I wanted to play the second one.
[133:29.94]But this one's still good.
[133:30.90]Ah, okay.
[133:32.36]I like the sounds of this one already.
[133:34.23]It's not lagging for me.
[133:35.97]It's probably because it has a lot less to need to render.
[133:39.79]Yeah, true.
[133:41.15]Also, I like the look of our turtles.
[133:42.50]We look so grumpy.
[133:44.70]We look like we do not want to be here.
[133:46.34]We have like a perpetual frown.
[133:49.24]It's just like our 9 to 5.
[133:51.46]I love that classic Nintendo.
[133:54.43]Everything starts to tear in the middle.
[133:59.89]Because I think it's supposed to be played on a CRT.
[134:03.46]I think you can turn on a filter.
[134:05.74]Oh, really?
[134:06.18]Do you want to get rid of the tearing?
[134:09.09]It looks like my graphics card is failing.
[134:13.25]It looks crazy.
[134:15.66]I do not remember games looking like this.
[134:26.74]In this game, when my X button picks up the enemy and throws them behind me, instead of just attacking.
[134:37.19]That's pretty sick.
[134:38.25]It's so weird.
[134:39.81]Like, it's not a stab.
[134:41.77]It's like I'm putting them on a kebab.
[134:43.51]It's so strange.
[134:44.09]Yeah, you're like skewering them.
[134:45.86]Yeah.
[134:47.76]Oh, and there we go.
[134:48.60]Finally, it hit.
[134:52.02]Skewered.
[134:55.10]The music's actually pretty good in this one, too.
[134:58.39]I like the sound effects.
[135:02.56]Is this one that we can beat in one sitting, too?
[135:05.06]It's gonna be like a really short game, right?
[135:06.98]Hey, come here.
[135:07.52]Yeah.
[135:08.36]We should beat this pretty quickly.
[135:09.35]Come here for a second.
[135:10.85]You can hit me?
[135:11.55]We can hurt each other.
[135:13.21]I was wondering why I was seeing you... Wait, let me try.
[135:15.64]You've already done it.
[135:16.78]This is... Okay, well, knowing that, now we gotta spread out.
[135:23.17]Stop!
[135:24.35]Stop!
[135:26.75]Do you want to eat a ghost pepper, or are you trying to eat a real ghost pepper?
[135:31.38]Oh, no, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[135:33.00]God, that would be the worst thing for us to have a ghost pepper stream.
[135:36.22]Dude, but you know the rules, right?
[135:38.31]If we don't beat every Ninja Turtles game in this whole collection in the next hour, we both have to eat a ghost pepper on camera.
[135:48.80]No.
[135:49.74]Really?
[135:50.08]Okay, fine.
[135:50.68]I mean, fine, fine.
[135:53.02]And it's not looking good.
[135:54.08]I'm actually nervous for that.
[135:59.25]I'm going to make sure I have milk ready.
[136:02.79]I'm going to have vanilla soft serve.
[136:05.90]How would you... Wait a second.
[136:08.50]You have soft serve at the ready, then you have to eat the ghost pepper really quick.
[136:12.17]Unless you store it in your refrigerator.
[136:13.69]Well, if you have a Ninja Creamy, you do.
[136:16.65]And you have one?
[136:17.93]Because you ruined that kid's birthday party and got a bunch of tickets.
[136:24.64]Yeah, I gotcha.
[136:25.72]Alright, message received.
[136:27.81]Dude, I remember this level.
[136:30.09]This part where they come out of the wood.
[136:33.97]I don't.
[136:37.33]I didn't know the posters do damage.
[136:41.98]What happens if you die?
[136:42.82]I wonder what happens if you die.
[136:47.00]We can find out.
[136:48.57]Here, Paul.
[136:50.05]Oh.
[136:51.85]Oh.
[136:53.28]Oh my god.
[136:54.52]What is that lag?
[136:55.68]Did you feel that lag?
[136:56.78]Yeah, that is Nintendo.
[136:58.35]That is not... That's on original hardware, by the way.
[137:01.59]That is original hardware.
[137:02.83]Dude, every time they jump, my PC lags.
[137:06.40]Yep.
[137:07.76]You can't jump either.
[137:09.16]Nope.
[137:10.28]That is legit.
[137:11.86]Oh my god, a jump completely crashes the game.
[137:14.41]I could load this game up.
[137:15.51]I got an NES.
[137:16.69]I could load it up and that same thing would happen.
[137:20.30]Oh yeah, this remake is really...
[137:22.88]It's really true.
[137:24.70]Oh, he does damage.
[137:30.01]Ah, okay.
[137:30.45]When I die, it just takes a life.
[137:34.38]Surely the game won't reset.
[137:35.48]Why is he gray?
[137:36.60]Looks like he's on the Game Boy version of him.
[137:40.09]Ah, this is total game over, by the way.
[137:42.77]No, not for me.
[137:43.55]You have to beat this, I think.
[137:45.04]Ah, I'll beat him.
[137:49.20]Nope.
[137:55.65]Come on, you can do it.
[137:57.05]He's not even blinking yet.
[137:58.93]Dude.
[138:01.80]Oh, he read me.
[138:05.94]There you go.
[138:06.48]Blinking.
[138:09.29]He's spamming.
[138:10.83]Mods?
[138:12.07]Venom?
[138:16.56]Oh my god.
[138:17.54]Oh, come on.
[138:19.68]You trust me.
[138:20.76]I'll clutch.
[138:22.04]I'm just getting it down to the wire for the cameras.
[138:24.47]See?
[138:24.67]Now, here we go.
[138:25.35]Watch.
[138:27.03]Why do you get to come back?
[138:32.22]I guess I died less than you.
[138:34.82]I didn't die once.
[138:36.16]There we go.
[138:37.50]Let's freaking go.
[138:40.33]You're welcome for the carry, I guess.
[138:43.17]Hey, as long as it means I get to come back.
[138:45.39]Sure, as long as we get to stay away from the ghost pepper.
[138:50.09]Cowabunga, dude.
[138:50.87]Let's ride the wave back to Madness.
[138:52.63]Cowabunga?
[138:53.15]Oh, I'm sorry.
[138:53.77]I totally misread that situation.
[138:56.72]Alright, well, it's all you.
[138:58.12]Right.
[138:58.50]Okay.
[138:59.52]Remember we played this level, but it was different?
[139:08.08]There we go!
[139:08.76]Pretty good!
[139:09.60]You're actually doing well.
[139:10.92]What do you mean, actually?
[139:16.53]Well, I can't... You actually are doing good.
[139:18.63]Like, I'm making a matter of fact statement.
[139:20.70]You sound so surprised.
[139:21.56]No, you said, wow, Squeaks.
[139:23.14]You usually dog shit.
[139:24.74]That's basically what I heard implicitly.
[139:26.22]I... Hold on, dude.
[139:32.21]I just got some community subs.
[139:33.47]I'll be back in like an hour.
[139:35.31]Oh, yeah.
[139:35.59]Go for it.
[139:40.45]Why would it be taking me an hour?
[139:41.53]I don't know.
[139:43.40]Maybe you have like a subscriber song or dance.
[139:46.47]That Freddy, that Freddy Dredd.
[139:48.69]Thanks, Freddy.
[139:49.09]What's up?
[139:49.39]Go ahead.
[139:51.25]How you doing, Freddy?
[139:52.02]It's been a while.
[139:56.70]That's our boy, Freddy Dredd.
[139:57.89]Oh, God.
[140:03.99]You got it.
[140:04.90]You've only gotten hit like once.
[140:06.44]Whoa, that was a move.
[140:08.42]Thank you.
[140:14.09]This slow-mo helps me, like, slow down the screen so I can dodge things.
[140:18.38]See?
[140:19.22]And I'm hitting every single one now.
[140:22.74]And we... Like, there's no way a human being can react to this.
[140:30.55]Watch that.
[140:31.43]You got an extra life!
[140:32.96]Oh, I'm back.
[140:33.68]I stole it from you.
[140:35.28]Oh, that's how it works.
[140:36.20]We're sharing lives, that's why.
[140:37.58]Alright, I'm Dantello.
[140:47.76]It's like we're playing Max Payne.
[140:51.50]Dude, am I killing you with this?
[140:53.83]Yes, you are.
[140:54.61]Wait, can we attack each other on here?
[140:56.77]No, no, no, don't.
[140:57.33]You have like one health.
[140:58.35]Oh, shit.
[140:58.91]Sorry.
[140:59.29]Yeah, we can.
[141:05.98]You... We have to... I'm focusing on the game.
[141:09.31]We have to be careful.
[141:11.75]I'm dead.
[141:12.37]It's all up to you.
[141:18.47]How much health do these things have?
[141:32.67]Nice, dude!
[141:33.27]Oh, that's a boss, isn't it?
[141:34.31]No?
[141:41.38]Alright, I'll try to get you back.
[141:43.10]No, no, no.
[141:44.52]You get me back by just doing a bunch of damage.
[141:48.37]That was such a troll.
[141:55.38]Oh, no.
[141:56.84]You're getting melted.
[141:59.04]You're getting melted here, man.
[142:01.53]Okay.
[142:07.03]Whoa.
[142:07.21]Oh, man.
[142:11.60]Do I have to kill that thing, too?
[142:13.04]No.
[142:14.14]I think I do.
[142:14.88]I don't think you can.
[142:17.02]How do I get the screen to move, though?
[142:18.49]I think you just move to the right.
[142:19.56]Now where is even a safe place to be right now?
[142:29.47]I don't know.
[142:29.75]The whole screen is taken off.
[142:31.25]This looks so difficult and if I was alive we'd be hitting each other.
[142:34.27]That's true.
[142:35.72]The zoning is crazy.
[142:36.82]Like is this like you just spam X?
[142:45.03]Oh.
[142:45.85]It is a regular Nintendo game.
[142:49.11]developers of regular Nintendo games did not expect you to beat them no game over okay have you ever played the original Toy Story game we could continue from there let's see let's see oh yeah let's try it oh if we have infinite continues that'd be sick I think we have two can we start right there oh yeah we're good wait that's amazing and we got three lives each wait this is alright so one of us has to focus on
[143:18.11]Watch out for the thing that pops up here, yeah.
[143:22.92]Okay.
[143:23.16]Okay, if you stay in the top left corner, you can't get hit by that.
[143:26.70]So, like, you kind of want to... I feel like you want to camp it a little bit.
[143:30.29]I'm trying to see if we can kill it.
[143:32.99]I don't think so.
[143:33.67]It looks like... Oh, you can.
[143:34.83]Yeah, you're right.
[143:35.65]It takes a lot, though.
[143:36.51]I'm not even sure it's worth it.
[143:40.14]Okay, let's go.
[143:46.06]Oh.
[143:47.21]Oh, perfect spot.
[143:50.21]How did you get hit?
[143:50.75]That was weird.
[143:51.43]I don't know.
[143:51.99]I think my animation, like, I'm sorry.
[143:56.12]I think you stay on that side.
[143:58.68]Toto, power!
[144:06.97]Nice.
[144:08.49]Oh.
[144:12.04]Oh my god, come on.
[144:14.22]Careful.
[144:14.98]Don't hit me.
[144:16.43]I'm trying to jump.
[144:17.37]Alright.
[144:18.97]We're good.
[144:19.21]Alright.
[144:19.43]There we go.
[144:20.41]Oh.
[144:22.03]Saved.
[144:26.98]Oh, man.
[144:29.08]We're good.
[144:29.50]Okay.
[144:29.72]Good.
[144:33.84]Oh, no.
[144:35.30]I'll focus on this thing.
[144:36.01]Just kill the guy.
[144:37.23]Yep.
[144:37.87]Killed.
[144:39.19]Nice.
[144:40.73]That's clean.
[144:41.15]Okay.
[144:41.31]I really like this game.
[144:43.13]It's challenging though.
[144:44.35]I like it a lot.
[144:47.24]The other one, the one before this, the Turtles 2, is the NES version of the arcade game.
[144:53.87]We should play the arcade game too, honestly, but that's four people.
[144:58.35]Oh my god, I can't imagine four Ninja Turtles on one of these screens.
[145:02.28]It's always so awesome.
[145:04.18]See your character.
[145:05.53]Amazing.
[145:09.05]Alright, next time we get four player Ninja Turtles.
[145:16.09]This is the best turtle game?
[145:19.15]Dude, I would play it.
[145:20.13]Oh my god, I kicked you.
[145:23.00]I'm sorry.
[145:23.22]That's only for the horsemen collab.
[145:24.88]Sad.
[145:26.80]Yeah, you gotta click here.
[145:29.13]Now I've been seeing horsemen all the time when she told me what the horsemen are.
[145:32.83]Does it come up a lot?
[145:34.71]It's like your group.
[145:37.02]Holy shit.
[145:42.18]Oh no.
[145:44.27]Oh no.
[145:45.64]Uh, we are taking applications for more horsemen, though.
[145:51.08]Um... We've got Pestilence, Famine, uh, Conquest, and, uh, War.
[145:55.75]Or, what, our Death.
[145:57.89]And, um, we were thinking about adding, uh, we need a, we need a Puke.
[146:02.95]We need a Greed.
[146:04.29]We need a Gluttony.
[146:06.86]Puke is just calling my name.
[146:09.62]We need an Anger.
[146:10.56]Dammit!
[146:15.81]What are you, the dwarves?
[146:17.09]What do you mean?
[146:17.91]What is over my earring?
[146:21.48]We need an insincere.
[146:24.10]Oh, that could be me.
[146:25.90]I have insincere guy voice.
[146:27.82]Can you hear it?
[146:28.90]Okay, he just destroyed me.
[146:30.81]He's so strong.
[146:33.35]Oh, no.
[146:35.23]He's now faster.
[146:36.09]Phase two.
[146:38.46]Jesus.
[146:41.04]Okay, he doesn't have the pole anymore.
[146:43.97]Seven deadly smurfs.
[146:48.30]Yeah, we need anything that you could be.
[146:53.70]We need an influencer smurf.
[146:56.18]I want to apply.
[146:57.73]I'm ready for the interview.
[146:58.57]I interview very well.
[146:59.99]Alright.
[147:00.77]What position would you like to apply for?
[147:02.27]Puke, but whatever you think is best.
[147:07.26]I mean, you know, what do you think?
[147:10.52]I just fell.
[147:12.73]Insincere.
[147:14.27]Okay.
[147:18.42]You could be one of the... You could be one of the people that blows the horn.
[147:25.76]What?
[147:27.27]Wait, do you mean like blows a horn to start the race of the horsemen?
[147:30.03]Like, what are we talking about?
[147:31.69]Yeah, during the apocalypse.
[147:33.07]The apocalypse starts.
[147:34.54]There's seven trumpet men that blow the trumpets to make the four horsemen show up.
[147:40.71]Right, right, right, right, right.
[147:42.05]So like the alert, the alert guy.
[147:44.03]It's like... Yes.
[147:48.26]And that's like the... Okay, so exactly like that.
[147:50.66]The apocalypse is really weird.
[147:51.86]I don't know if you're familiar with it.
[147:54.47]Not familiar with the apocalypse.
[147:57.23]It's like in phases.
[147:58.13]But that sounds weird.
[147:59.75]Okay, what are the phases?
[148:01.09]Okay, memory's going to serve me bad here, but there are phases of the apocalypse.
[148:05.36]It's like a Dark Souls boss.
[148:07.30]It's like it starts with seven horns, and then they dump acid on everybody, and then the seven bells ring after that happens, and then the boils start.
[148:17.85]The horsemen don't show up until, like, phase three.
[148:21.66]Wait, are the horsemen bad guys, or are they, like, the ones to save the world from the apocalypse?
[148:25.92]They're here just to destroy us.
[148:27.21]Just destroy everything.
[148:28.91]Oh, okay, so you're a villain.
[148:31.71]So you got, like, a villain group.
[148:33.43]Don't be an asshole.
[148:35.72]Try to be a good fucking person.
[148:37.94]Try.
[148:38.56]I mean, I get it.
[148:39.36]It's hard.
[148:40.01]It can be.
[148:42.55]Right.
[148:43.79]Hey, remember these guys from the last game?
[148:46.17]Yeah, I do.
[148:46.98]They're, uh... They're heavy.
[148:51.92]Imagine throwing that many grenades.
[148:54.67]These guys take so many hits.
[148:56.17]Oh my god, this guy is cheating.
[148:59.22]Okay, I gotta stay close to him.
[149:01.98]Okay, so I'll be the horseman jester.
[149:03.82]Or the, sorry, the trumpet guy.
[149:05.90]What's the name?
[149:07.42]I don't know if they even have names.
[149:10.97]The nameless jester.
[149:11.95]Why is he, he can walk on that?
[149:13.77]Wait, you can walk on this?
[149:14.77]I thought this was just falling.
[149:16.23]I thought we were gonna fall.
[149:18.00]Damn, okay, well.
[149:23.46]They should remake this game.
[149:24.54]3D.
[149:26.47]I think they did.
[149:27.05]And it was bad?
[149:29.97]There's one for SEGA Genesis.
[149:31.43]I think it's the same title.
[149:33.50]Ah, okay.
[149:34.30]Or a similar title.
[149:35.96]Didn't they make a new one of these recently on the Switch?
[149:39.44]Or am I just making that up?
[149:40.45]They did, and it's actually very good.
[149:43.01]I've heard.
[149:48.44]You know what?
[149:48.78]I'll tell you.
[149:51.00]The Ninja Turtles have done something that I don't think any franchise has done in human history.
[149:57.13]We're talking since people were pushing wheelbarrows around.
[150:00.16]Okay, and what's that?
[150:02.94]Every generation, there seems to be, like the Ninja Turtles game, there's always a good one.
[150:08.31]Every generation, it feels like.
[150:10.66]It's actually shocking.
[150:12.78]The games are like, have over surpassed the show.
[150:16.53]Honestly, I don't even know if the show is that popular anymore.
[150:19.19]I agree, yeah.
[150:21.15]That's kind of crazy.
[150:22.07]Yeah, you're right.
[150:22.65]I can't think of another instance.
[150:24.62]I guess Pokémon?
[150:25.54]No, the games aren't as good.
[150:30.54]You ever watch the show Captain Planet?
[150:32.46]Yeah.
[150:33.68]I don't know why that doesn't have a good game.
[150:36.56]Right?
[150:37.74]That feels like a perfect arcade game.
[150:42.11]Although what would heart do?
[150:45.17]I like, I don't know, like shoot like hearts at people and then like their ult could be like, yeah, like love and heal a healer.
[150:54.86]Okay.
[150:56.22]Can you name the powers of Captain Planet without looking?
[151:02.26]Isn't it like Earth, Wind, Fire, and Love?
[151:09.19]With these four elements, Captain Pla- Did I just make that up?
[151:13.72]You're close.
[151:15.20]With those four elements combined forms Captain Planet.
[151:19.62]Earth, Wind, Fire, Heart.
[151:22.93]Earth, Wind, Water, Fire, Heart.
[151:28.59]And what did I say?
[151:30.36]You said the same thing.
[151:31.94]Yeah, so I did it.
[151:33.37]Oh, water, water.
[151:35.79]You didn't say water?
[151:37.69]No, I guess not.
[151:38.45]I thought you said water.
[151:43.40]No, someone in chat said, what are you doing?
[151:45.94]I think that's not... I knew I fucked up.
[151:49.97]Who is this enemy, by the way?
[151:51.25]What's his name?
[151:52.33]Slash.
[151:53.31]He's the guy that was really horrible in the Turtles in Time.
[151:56.19]Ah, okay, okay.
[151:58.71]Dude, I love Slash because he turns into like an anti-hero at some point halfway through the series.
[152:05.98]Okay.
[152:08.68]I'm not familiar with the lore, please.
[152:10.36]He's bad, but he then becomes good and he helps the turtles sometimes.
[152:13.60]Oh, wow.
[152:14.94]In which, uh, in the show or in the books or?
[152:18.45]Everything.
[152:20.21]Okay, cool.
[152:22.07]Hey, do you take two slices of pizza before somebody gets one?
[152:26.86]I'm an asshole.
[152:28.81]I'm the opposite of the enemy.
[152:31.42]I'm good, but I'm going to turn bad.
[152:33.40]And we have to fight as the final battle.
[152:36.40]Because there is team damage.
[152:38.85]And did you know Metalhead actually is good too?
[152:40.97]Because Donatello ends up reprogramming him to not be evil.
[152:46.08]You're not going to like what I'm about to say, Jerma.
[152:48.40]I'm warning you.
[152:49.94]But don't you think that is a little bit of a predictable trope?
[153:01.33]Yeah, but it became predictable because Donatello did it.
[153:04.69]He was the first ever?
[153:06.14]Yeah, Donatello reprograms Metalhead, and then Luka reprograms Robo, and all of a sudden everybody, that's a trope now.
[153:15.06]Oh, okay.
[153:15.90]Right, so they could just call it the Donatello.
[153:17.97]Also, I think I have it wrong.
[153:20.13]I think Donatello made Metalhead.
[153:23.89]Ah.
[153:24.01]No, that's the Avengers.
[153:24.97]That's Ultron.
[153:27.05]What is his lore?
[153:28.14]It's something like that, right?
[153:29.98]I don't remember Ultron's lore.
[153:31.97]I feel like whenever I watch those movies, I go out enjoying it, but can't recall a single thing that I saw.
[153:37.89]But I like the experience of it.
[153:39.75]So I think it's just like the popcorn and Dr. Pepper.
[153:43.52]That's true.
[153:44.86]Right.
[153:45.12]Okay.
[153:45.38]So let me get this straight.
[153:46.16]So Darth Vader, Donatello'd to the light side.
[153:50.12]Is that a fair use of it?
[153:51.17]No, no, no.
[153:51.49]Since he was the first?
[153:52.47]Donatello'd.
[153:54.37]Metalhead was Darth Vader'd.
[153:59.01]But he, no, Metalhead, Donatello... Who is Donatello in this scenario?
[154:06.98]Donatello would be... No, no, no, Donatello is Anakin, and he fixes C-3PO, which is Metalhead.
[154:16.75]And then R2-D2.
[154:17.51]Okay, but so then, but Metalhead's bad.
[154:20.69]C-3PO's never bad.
[154:21.76]You know how evil R2-D2 was before he got his fucking wires crossed up again?
[154:26.67]No, I don't.
[154:27.81]R2-D2... You don't know that?
[154:30.41]I've read the books.
[154:31.79]R2-D2 was fucking evil.
[154:33.93]He was like an evil ship captain.
[154:37.20]Oh, R2-D2 was a captain.
[154:38.32]Is this like your own lore?
[154:41.04]He was in the evil ship captain.
[154:45.56]Are you calling me captain?
[154:48.83]Captain.
[154:49.81]Listen, captain.
[154:51.15]The way you articulated that sentence was he was in the evil ship captain.
[154:56.33]There was a weird pause there, you're right.
[154:58.74]There was.
[155:01.62]Right, okay, he was in the Empire ship, that's correct.
[155:04.43]You're right.
[155:04.93]I see what you mean.
[155:05.73]In the New Hope.
[155:07.41]Like, how'd he get there?
[155:08.83]Hey, you know that there's a theory that R2-D2 did fucking everything and Luke just merely sat there while his, like, fucking self-driving car did all the work for him?
[155:19.29]Okay, I actually, I agree with that theory.
[155:23.45]I see it.
[155:25.21]Have I told you my, um... Like, this is just something I barely think about, but have I told you this, uh... What I would have done for the Obi-Wan show?
[155:34.40]Oh, I've never seen the Obi-Wan show, so you're gonna... You're gonna give me a lot of, um, info here.
[155:39.12]No, no, it's not... It's not gonna reference anything that happens in the Obi-Wan show.
[155:42.87]But it's just something that I... If I was to write the story, I have a really good idea.
[155:47.19]Dude, he's kicking the shit out of me.
[155:51.67]Oh, I'm getting free hits, by the way.
[155:53.66]He's, like, targeting you.
[155:54.54]Look.
[155:55.94]Yo, just spam him.
[155:56.82]Wait, what's happening?
[155:59.16]He's completely glitched.
[156:02.74]Okay, we're good.
[156:06.89]Wait, this is like... Oh, he got me.
[156:09.37]That hitbox is gigantic.
[156:12.91]Oh, he hit me.
[156:14.54]How much health does he have?
[156:15.84]I'm going to die again.
[156:19.74]There we go.
[156:21.44]There we go.
[156:23.92]Basically, the premise is Obi-Wan meets his clone, and it's Obi-2.
[156:27.14]So, I don't know.
[156:27.96]Just something I've been thinking about.
[156:30.87]Stupid, isn't it?
[156:32.17]And you think that's shit?
[156:33.43]Oh, I think that's amazing.
[156:35.47]That's the way it should be.
[156:36.61]Like, think about it.
[156:38.24]Kamino can clone not only Stormtroopers, but also Force users.
[156:41.64]I don't know.
[156:42.04]Just... Join me.
[156:46.35]And together we can destroy it.
[156:47.65]Oh my god.
[156:51.06]Yeah, you can... That's Obi-2.
[156:52.32]You sound exactly like Obi-2.
[157:01.41]I have 71,300 points.
[157:02.55]I have... I have more than you.
[157:08.06]72,000.
[157:09.17]Why is my face so itchy?
[157:15.06]Oh, is it because of your AC?
[157:17.80]Actually, it might be.
[157:19.03]It dries, like I get all super dry from this.
[157:21.57]Well, I don't have AC.
[157:22.31]I have that cold thing, but it makes the air super dry.
[157:24.94]My room is like, I'm so particular.
[157:27.74]It's crazy.
[157:28.34]How is New York right now?
[157:30.23]I have a humidifier going.
[157:31.29]I've got blankets on.
[157:32.73]It's so cozy in here, let me tell you.
[157:34.99]And I got a cup of coffee.
[157:36.57]That sounds awesome, actually.
[157:38.10]I can't do that here.
[157:38.94]I'm telling you.
[157:39.94]Why not?
[157:41.08]Because it's Las Vegas and it's 110 degrees.
[157:44.78]Yeah, but your weather is good.
[157:46.58]I am so bad at dealing with winters.
[157:51.19]Like, I get all sad and stuff if I don't see the sun.
[157:53.85]I actually love the winter.
[157:55.22]One thing I actually miss from the East Coast.
[157:57.58]Really?
[157:57.74]But the winter is just so brutal.
[157:59.44]Like, the cold, you can't even leave your house.
[158:01.26]I love that, dude.
[158:01.93]I don't know.
[158:02.61]There's nothing that I love more than when you go to your car and your whole car is a frosted glass.
[158:10.21]It's horrible.
[158:11.09]I love it.
[158:12.53]You're saying it in like a Hallmark movie voice, but it's just like when I'd wake up at 5 a.m.
[158:17.81]or whatever to go to work and it's freezing outside and then I have to chisel the snow from my window.
[158:24.28]It's absolute pain.
[158:25.48]Yeah, but it's something about it.
[158:27.02]I feel like it like builds like character, like getting out there and scraping.
[158:30.95]And like, I gotta get out of those fucking wheels.
[158:33.07]You know what I mean?
[158:33.52]Like, get under there and like, dig and shovel.
[158:35.90]Scrape!
[158:36.52]Scrape!
[158:37.16]Yeah, the windshield wipers are gone.
[158:38.32]The heat is blaring.
[158:39.27]You can start to barely see through the windshield.
[158:41.05]I feel like it's... And you're listening to morning radio.
[158:44.44]Like, just with your door open.
[158:46.84]Yeah, I mean, that's why East Coast people have a very specific type of energy, I think.
[158:50.09]It's because of experiences like that.
[158:55.03]Yeah, when finally you get there and you got enough room to see and you got enough room to go... There's nothing nicer and toastier than being in that car.
[159:02.74]Yeah, but like also if it doesn't fully thaw but you're late to work and you have to drive out of a small little sliver in your window and you realize how dangerous that is so you pull over and you have to do it again, it's horrible.
[159:14.23]That's also horrible.
[159:16.16]Oh, sorry.
[159:17.32]Yeah, trust me when I say that there were times when it was so cold that I remember even when it was good, sometimes it would start to not be good.
[159:27.38]What do you mean?
[159:28.12]What do you mean?
[159:28.72]Like, the windows would fog up.
[159:30.45]Ah, yes, yes.
[159:31.11]It was, like, frosting while you were driving it.
[159:33.57]Yes, I've had this.
[159:35.01]Yeah, that's so dangerous.
[159:36.61]It's just like, fuck, am I about to do, like, the Ace Ventura, like, put my head out the window and drive that way?
[159:42.00]Yeah, like the Joker.
[159:43.79]You're like the Joker there.
[159:45.21]Yeah, very dangerous.
[159:51.42]That's right.
[159:52.82]Yeah, remember that scene where he has his, uh...
[159:55.80]head out the window of course I feel like that everybody at some point has had that moment where they go I gotta put my head out the window yeah like a dog it feels good but if you ever do that it's like holy like you don't realize like even if you're going like five miles per hour yeah you have to eat a lot of air yeah but I'm such a coward now like if I'm in a car I have to have the window open or I get sick wait what say that again
[160:25.01]Like, if I'm in a car, for some reason, like a taxi or something, I have to roll down the window or I get nauseous.
[160:30.92]Oh, that sucks.
[160:33.42]It's brutal.
[160:34.20]I don't know why.
[160:34.90]And I used to drive all the time and not have to do that.
[160:37.07]Dude, did I... For some reason, that happens to me only in a Tesla.
[160:46.19]Yeah, me too.
[160:46.93]Wait, that's so funny you say that.
[160:48.31]I just had a conversation with my friend.
[160:50.17]Are you serious?
[160:50.95]My friend, yes.
[160:52.32]Something about the Tesla, and you know what I think it is?
[160:54.66]This is what I told my friend.
[160:56.06]I said it's because Teslas are so, like, their acceleration is so strong.
[160:59.89]And when people drive it, they go super fast and then brake suddenly a ton.
[161:04.12]So when you're doing, like, city driving, it's just a lot of stop and go.
[161:07.36]So it makes people super sick.
[161:09.36]Because I have the same experience.
[161:11.13]it was it's weird because it's horrible for me yeah I because I I can't remember the last time I was in a Tesla but the I I was in one one time and this is it would like the third this would be the third or fourth time I'd been in a Tesla and it was me and my girlfriend were out we were like kind of out you know having dinner and just kind of hanging out we went out for like a date whatever and on the way back it was a Tesla that drove us back
[161:37.42]And I was like, oh my God.
[161:39.69]And we got into the house and I fucking puked instantly.
[161:42.44]Jesus, yeah.
[161:43.16]I puked instantly.
[161:43.98]I ran to the toilet and I puked.
[161:46.26]Now... Yeah, that's brutal.
[161:47.86]I was like four drinks... I was like three or four drinks deep.
[161:52.33]So it had to be... So you don't know if it's the drinks or the Tesla?
[161:55.87]No, no, no.
[161:56.56]Because I confirmed it.
[161:57.82]Because before that, I was in a Tesla and I got motion sick.
[162:01.16]And then after the puke night, I got in one again and I got motion sick again.
[162:05.89]So it definitely was... It had something to do with it.
[162:08.55]Sure.
[162:08.89]But the drinks probably did not help.
[162:10.57]Motion sickness plus alcohol is probably a deadly combo.
[162:14.80]I have one health.
[162:17.11]I'm chilling.
[162:17.69]I'm doing well.
[162:18.83]Oh, 96,800.
[162:20.39]And dude, you ever puke so much that you can't even believe that you were holding that much liquid inside of you?
[162:28.06]Oh yeah, it's insane.
[162:28.90]I have some bad news.
[162:30.74]I have a peanut allergy, and every time I have a peanut, I have to puke.
[162:34.63]So I'm a pro.
[162:35.55]I'm pro.
[162:36.31]Oh, that's horrible.
[162:38.03]Yeah, it's terrible.
[162:39.61]But yeah, it's disgusting.
[162:41.15]It's insane.
[162:43.23]But it's so weird how much fluid is in us.
[162:46.45]For sure.
[162:47.18]And that's not even all of it.
[162:48.68]Careful.
[162:50.66]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[162:51.86]Take one of my lives.
[162:53.72]Oh.
[162:55.63]Oh, now you... Oh, shit.
[162:57.21]Okay.
[162:58.25]Oh, I can't take it anymore.
[162:59.69]I'm going to say it's the regenerative breaking is what does it for some people.
[163:02.64]I think we talked about it before.
[163:07.06]Regenerative breaking, apparently.
[163:09.38]I don't even know what that means.
[163:11.19]The brake mana regenerates?
[163:14.16]That's what I'm thinking.
[163:15.02]It's like a game of League of Legends again.
[163:16.68]Do you know a lot about cars?
[163:25.11]Oh, the battery!
[163:26.73]I completely get it now.
[163:29.52]Hey, we need to let people know when the nausea talk is over, people are eating.
[163:34.30]Okay, it's over.
[163:34.82]I don't know!
[163:38.77]I will not bring up puke again.
[163:41.69]I feel like a third of my stream is talking about puking or shitting.
[163:45.59]I don't- Me too.
[163:48.29]Or like, picking noses and stuff.
[163:50.08]Yeah, I get it.
[163:50.62]Same.
[163:53.24]Oh!
[163:54.88]Like, if you're sitting- Jerma, when you were in school, and you had to blow your nose, would you like, be the guy who gets up, grabs a tissue, and like, blows it during class?
[164:05.97]Like, that's- I don't know.
[164:08.30]I've just never been that guy.
[164:09.56]Yeah, me neither.
[164:10.12]I would go to the bathroom.
[164:11.64]And I would do it in the bathroom.
[164:14.48]Just to make sure.
[164:16.00]Look, if you do that in class or in public or whatever, just out, you don't know if you got them all out.
[164:22.79]Because you could blow your nose and be like, okay, that was good.
[164:24.92]And you just got shit hanging out of your nose or, like, crusty shit in your nostrils.
[164:28.68]And you're continuously checking.
[164:31.10]Like, I would continuously check.
[164:32.12]I was like, oh, shoot, I have a booger on my face.
[164:33.75]If you do it in the bathroom, exactly.
[164:35.05]If you do it in the bathroom, you have an opportunity to, you know, clean up, look in the mirror, okay, I look fine, or...
[164:43.09]I'm with you.
[164:43.74]Or, yeah, I mean, and then if I really can't go to the bathroom and I'm, like, on a time crunch, it's gonna be a little nasty.
[164:49.36]Sorry if you're eating, you can mute for a second.
[164:51.44]Booger sleeve.
[164:54.19]Right?
[164:54.71]We can be real.
[164:56.95]Did you eat your boogers?
[164:58.57]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[164:59.41]Booger sleeve.
[165:00.62]You know, like a long hoodie.
[165:02.48]Just a little, you know, you know what I mean.
[165:04.20]Is that disgusting?
[165:06.45]I feel like you really left me hanging here.
[165:07.81]Okay, I have an embarrassing story to tell you.
[165:11.64]It's a great segue.
[165:13.42]Alright, alright.
[165:14.33]It's a great segue to something else.
[165:17.17]So you know DugDug, right?
[165:18.86]Of course I love DugDug.
[165:20.04]DugDug, awesome guy.
[165:22.04]So, I found a paper...
[165:25.35]That was, oh, this is some notes from Doug Doug's Shufflemania.
[165:30.18]This is like a hard copy of this.
[165:32.22]Like he had done a ton of run of show stuff.
[165:35.04]We were in a call talking about different bits and different ideas for his Shufflemania show.
[165:40.33]And I'm like, oh, this is actually kind of cool.
[165:41.55]I want to like preserve this.
[165:42.41]This is like a fun little thing of like notes that we took and like his run of show things that he had.
[165:47.52]Yeah.
[165:48.00]I turn this over and I'm not kidding, dude.
[165:50.98]There's like three boogers on it.
[165:53.70]I couldn't fucking believe it.
[165:55.14]I was like, what?
[165:56.02]I was like, when did I do that?
[165:57.96]Like, no way!
[165:59.04]And what I think happened was there was a stack of papers on my desk.
[166:06.25]And at one point, I must have, like, had a problem, and I think this is what happened.
[166:11.02]I was like, oh, I have to blow my nose, and I blew my nose, and too much came out, and I was like, oh, fuck, I don't have a napkin.
[166:15.30]And I think I put it on the back of, oh, there's a random paper on my desk.
[166:20.49]I was so mad about it, dude, you have no idea.
[166:23.87]I forgot about it when you retroactively were mad.
[166:27.34]That's way worse than a booger sleeve, man.
[166:32.97]No, it was bad.
[166:33.81]On a piece of paper?
[166:35.38]I was so pissed about it because I don't do that shit.
[166:38.43]I don't do that.
[166:39.87]I mean, you clearly do.
[166:40.85]I mean, it's alright.
[166:41.57]Well, I did it once.
[166:42.31]Just this one.
[166:42.99]I thought, oh, there's like a turned over paper here.
[166:44.98]I'll clean it up.
[166:47.58]And then it lasted for two years.
[166:51.73]Oh, my God.
[166:52.19]A two-year-old booger.
[166:53.61]So it's like dry.
[166:57.72]Oh, God.
[166:58.84]By the way, it might be game over for us here.
[167:00.86]It actually could be game over.
[167:02.88]But it's a good segue to talk about Doug Doug because Doug Doug's doing a charity event.
[167:09.70]yes um are you watching anything I am I am are you I I can't think of any ideas and it's a game over uh what are you auctioning so because it's for the the what the monterey bay aquarium is the uh benefiting the moderate moderate bay aquarium he's doing like a few days worth of stuff
[167:31.68]So he hit me up.
[167:32.32]He's like, hey, dude, if you want to do something, you know, like marine themed or nautical themed.
[167:38.16]And I was like, oh, shit.
[167:41.55]Yeah, I got something.
[167:44.35]Part of the auction or raffle, I'm not sure what he's going to use it with, but part of it, I have an item.
[167:49.96]It is the Seaman microphone.
[167:52.62]The one that I played Seaman with four or five years ago.
[167:57.01]I signed it, and it's the original microphone.
[167:59.49]It's the one that I actually used.
[168:00.87]So that's going up for auction or raffle or something, so.
[168:04.72]I was like, that's perfect.
[168:05.66]That's a great idea.
[168:06.66]That's so cool.
[168:08.74]So, is it the dirty one?
[168:10.46]I mean, it's the one I used on stream.
[168:13.77]It's like your spit is probably on it so that someone can clone you.
[168:17.57]So then you're going to be at the airport one day, and you're going to see someone that looks exactly like you.
[168:21.90]You're going to be like, duh, seaman.
[168:25.25]Yeah, maybe like 30 years.
[168:26.39]They would have to age 30 or 40 years.
[168:28.18]Yeah, I mean, can you imagine?
[168:30.86]That's so scary.
[168:32.82]It'll be your OB2 moment.
[168:36.29]I've cleaned that since.
[168:39.75]I take care of my equipment.
[168:42.76]Ah, well, whoever wins the auction, we'll see.
[168:45.88]Yeah, I've cleaned that very extensively over the years.
[168:50.25]I've had it displayed.
[168:51.29]I have it displayed on my... I had it displayed on my Reddit shelf.
[168:56.10]Wait, that's a great idea.
[168:57.60]I have to think of something.
[168:59.73]I don't know what, though.
[169:03.47]You know, DougDoug, on a charity auction, bought a one-hour Stardew Valley date with me, and he never redeemed it.
[169:13.10]Really?
[169:14.30]Yeah!
[169:14.93]He spent a lot of money, and he just was like, nah, it's fine.
[169:19.23]DougDoug, anytime you want to play!
[169:23.51]He never redeemed it.
[169:24.99]That's so funny because you can't be mad about that, right?
[169:29.49]Because he has to redeem it.
[169:32.58]Yeah.
[169:33.04]He could do it at any moment.
[169:36.42]And he just never does.
[169:37.62]Well, we talked about it.
[169:38.66]He's like, no, I got a great idea coming up.
[169:41.05]And then that's it.
[169:45.83]He's like, no, we're going to do it.
[169:47.11]It's going to be a really fun time.
[169:48.83]And then nope.
[169:50.29]How do you even play Stardew Valley?
[169:52.45]You get through the tutorial in an hour.
[169:53.95]Yeah.
[169:56.94]I mean, honestly, Stardew Valley is like... You gotta dedicate months and months to a farm.
[170:03.82]Unless you're really good.
[170:05.81]That's a great game, though.
[170:06.85]That's one of the best games ever.
[170:08.07]That actually is one of the best games ever.
[170:10.37]For sure.
[170:12.07]I went to their Concerned Ape.
[170:14.76]The creator has these concerts that are really good.
[170:17.28]I went to the one recently, and he was there.
[170:20.32]That was so awesome.
[170:21.21]I mean, yeah, he just goes to these concerts, I guess.
[170:24.11]That's cool.
[170:24.67]But it was so sick.
[170:25.53]It was so sick.
[170:28.63]Like, he was like, they were like playing their music and then they're like, oh, and as a huge surprise, Concerned Ape, please take a stand and say hi to everybody.
[170:37.16]And he's sitting like two rows ahead of me.
[170:39.45]Yeah.
[170:40.03]That's so cool.
[170:41.43]I know.
[170:41.67]I was like, oh my God.
[170:42.53]I've seen some of the interviews with him.
[170:46.59]He seems like a really just chill guy.
[170:49.97]Yeah, he seems super down to Earth.
[170:52.40]He's just kind of like, yeah, I don't know, maybe there'll be another update.
[170:54.70]Yeah, whatever.
[170:55.24]Yeah.
[170:57.09]Like, if I made Stardew Valley, I'd walk with my chest out, you know, marching around like I own the place.
[171:01.90]I don't understand how he stays so humble.
[171:03.90]It's so crazy that he continues to...
[171:07.14]How many patches has he done to the game?
[171:09.02]How many years has it been?
[171:10.44]It's been a decade.
[171:11.42]It's been like 1.7.
[171:12.84]Yeah, and he's making another game at the same time.
[171:15.88]It's insane.
[171:16.74]Dude, if I ever made a game, I've told everybody that's watching on my side this, maybe you heard about this, but if I ever make a game, there's going to be a splash screen at the very beginning that comes up before you even get to the title screen.
[171:27.59]And it's going to say, warning, alert.
[171:30.20]There will never be a patch to this game.
[171:32.58]I don't take feedback.
[171:34.34]Shove it up your ass.
[171:36.40]That would be the splat.
[171:37.50]You have to confirm that.
[171:38.78]That would be the... That's a Reddit thread, Jerma.
[171:41.01]That's a hate thread, for sure.
[171:43.33]No, that's just in my agreement.
[171:45.67]It's just like, there's never going to be a patch.
[171:47.34]I don't take any feedback.
[171:48.30]The game sucks.
[171:49.10]And I would say the game sucks.
[171:51.42]This game sucks, and I don't care.
[171:53.63]Shove it up your ass.
[171:54.25]I don't care.
[171:54.87]I'm not patching this ever.
[171:57.66]That's actually, I actually respect that a lot.
[172:00.52]Yeah, but then if like- And what type of game would it be?
[172:02.42]Well, but if somebody's like, um, dude, uh, in Act 3, like, what the fuck is going on with Act 3?
[172:08.03]Act 3 sucks.
[172:09.41]I can just paste that.
[172:10.61]And people go, oh, right, that did say that in the beginning.
[172:13.48]Right, you have to shove it up my ass.
[172:15.22]That's what it said.
[172:15.94]Like, I'm gonna fucking never send an email.
[172:18.04]It's just, you pressed accept on, hey, this game sucks and I'll never patch it and I don't listen to feedback.
[172:23.24]Wait, can I give you some feedback on your feedback?
[172:26.39]Like, what if you hid the intro?
[172:28.37]Like, what if you hid that stuff after, like, please do not pirate this, like, the regular, don't do drugs, and then don't complain.
[172:35.28]So that, you know, maybe you won't have, like, as much backlash because it's surrounded by, you know, some good advice.
[172:41.76]Like, yeah, you hit A, and then it says you also accept to don't do drugs.
[172:46.83]Exactly.
[172:47.35]Like, everyone's gonna spam A because they're gonna say Konami, Bandai Namco, Ubisoft.
[172:51.20]Like, it's gonna have, like, those character splashes.
[172:53.16]And then the very last one is gonna be, you know, I don't give a shit about you.
[172:59.15]No, but I don't want you to skip that.
[173:01.19]It needs to be unskippable.
[173:02.17]It has to be five seconds unskippable, and it has to go... Okay, so it's gonna be... You want it to be intrusive.
[173:12.62]I want people to see it.
[173:14.08]I don't want it to be skippable.
[173:15.18]Right.
[173:15.81]Okay, and it makes what sound?
[173:17.63]It goes... It makes an alarm alert sound.
[173:21.52]But soft.
[173:21.72]Oh, you should make it the iPhone alert.
[173:23.65]No, no, no, no.
[173:26.56]The iPhone alarm clock.
[173:29.53]I fucking hate that thing.
[173:31.60]Me too.
[173:32.68]The one time I got a really mean message was the one time I played it when I was like doing like a seven hour stream.
[173:39.45]I thought it'd be, I know it's so evil.
[173:41.94]I started playing the iPhone alert and I got a, people were not happy.
[173:45.30]No.
[173:45.74]Yeah.
[173:46.07]I would, I would say the same thing about any alarm that is in a TV commercial or a movie or that should just be banned forever.
[173:53.62]That should be illegal.
[173:55.18]100% agree.
[173:55.92]And same thing with, like, police sirens on the radio.
[173:58.96]Yes.
[173:59.46]Or car honking sounds.
[174:00.58]That's insane.
[174:01.35]Oh my god, it's so insane that that's still allowed.
[174:03.67]I completely agree with that.
[174:07.85]Okay, put all that in the beginning of your game.
[174:09.84]Like a little petition that they can sign, too.
[174:12.78]Like a change.org thing that they have to click Aeon to sign.
[174:16.83]We can change the world with this game, Jerma.
[174:18.67]we can change no we can't it's gonna it's gonna be like a 3D platformer that you can see the edges of the screen tearing and it's gonna break yeah it's gonna be a terrible game just remake jetpack joyride I feel like that game is good and it didn't get enough love there's so many retro classic kind of games that I want to play
[174:40.22]No, dude, they're so... It's crazy because you play them and they're actually so good.
[174:44.68]Like, even in San Aquarium.
[174:46.56]Like, I was like, oh, this is like a really... I don't remember much of this game.
[174:49.36]You play it and it still stands the test of time.
[174:51.77]It's so good.
[174:53.01]It's so good.
[174:53.79]I cannot hit these guys.
[174:55.93]They saved my life.
[174:58.31]Nice.
[174:58.73]We did it.
[175:00.15]Even Plants vs. Zombies.
[175:02.58]So good.
[175:03.34]I did a playthrough of that and just really enjoyed it.
[175:06.52]There's a remake coming out, right?
[175:08.02]Or a rehashing of it?
[175:10.46]I mean, I don't think they changed much in it.
[175:12.76]That's the problem.
[175:13.96]I think it's like the exact same thing, except the textures look a little better, maybe?
[175:18.92]Like HD graphics or something?
[175:20.07]Yeah.
[175:21.27]But I don't think you need HD glasses.
[175:23.41]HD graphics.
[175:25.25]That would be crazy.
[175:27.77]Dude, I would.
[175:28.67]HD glasses, Plants vs. Zombies.
[175:32.70]That's an idea.
[175:35.22]It looks good on its own.
[175:36.56]The second one, Plants vs. Zombies 2, was so bad.
[175:39.45]it was but have you played garden warfare no a shooter I have not they made like a shooter game that's like Overwatch that's like exceptionally good I've actually heard people liked it a lot it's really good like it shouldn't have been that good I feel like but it's really fun alright here we go we got lives this time alright let's freaking go
[176:08.64]We're way better now.
[176:10.56]We are so much better.
[176:11.28]Hey, I've been stuck on the challenge ribbon Silksong for five hours.
[176:14.09]Are you a Silksong fan?
[176:16.77]No, I've never played.
[176:19.85]I've never finished Hollow Knight.
[176:21.75]Same here.
[176:23.43]I mean, I know I'd like it.
[176:24.30]I love Metroidvanias.
[176:26.48]But for some reason, I just never beat it.
[176:29.26]Oh my god, he's targeting me.
[176:33.94]I thought it was great.
[176:35.17]I thought it was great.
[176:40.11]Yeah, no.
[176:40.72]But why didn't you beat it then?
[176:42.86]It's like the hard question.
[176:44.43]I know.
[176:45.39]I get it.
[176:46.83]Yeah.
[176:47.52]I think it's because with a... What, a Metroidvania?
[176:52.85]Mm-hmm.
[176:53.19]I love those games, but I feel like if you stop playing those games for an extended period in the middle of your playthrough, needing to remember, like, okay, I'm gonna pick it up like a week, two weeks later.
[177:03.47]Okay, where the fuck am I?
[177:06.09]And I need to get the bubble to float up to the platform on that corner of the map, and I have to remember that.
[177:10.46]I just feel like you kind of, you can't really drop that and come back like a month later.
[177:14.74]It's hard to do that.
[177:15.58]Yeah, even just like your map memory and stuff is crazy.
[177:19.33]You kind of need to get that done in a row.
[177:22.97]I think dropping those... It's a bingeable game.
[177:25.44]That's why you kind of have to do it in like one... You can't game hop.
[177:29.42]That's why I fell off of playing Metroid Dread 2.
[177:31.52]I loved it so much, but then I came back to it.
[177:33.97]I was like, where do I go?
[177:35.13]What do I have to do?
[177:36.05]There's no yellow paint.
[177:38.53]I just have to drop it.
[177:40.31]but you know what game I have been playing which is new is the new Metal Gear the Metal Gear Solid oh the free remake it's good it's my first Metal Gear game it's really I've instantly I just love it so much I can't believe I've never played a Metal Gear before it you should play the the first one at least play the first one the first one's oh for sure for sure I will I I actually bought it recently I was like I've got to play this at some point I think the first one's a little more digestible too than some of the other ones
[178:11.02]I like the story well just like everything it's a little more I mean it was the first well you know you count the nes ones nice we did it yeah no I got it I got it I want to play them all now I'm enjoying this one so much I'm like I just like the tone of it it's so goofy yeah three is great three I love three yeah you should play the remake maybe I will play any deadlock
[178:39.59]Oh, yeah.
[178:40.89]I've been playing.
[178:41.61]Do you play Deadlock?
[178:42.57]No, not at all.
[178:44.37]No.
[178:45.38]I know Poke plays a lot of Deadlock.
[178:47.66]Poke messaged me about Deadlock.
[178:49.58]But he just said, he said, and I quote, Squeaks, you play Deadlock?
[178:53.55]And I said, yeah, I do, but I'm so bad.
[178:56.33]And that was the end of the conversation.
[178:59.64]You're too bad.
[179:00.88]He's like, okay, never mind.
[179:03.72]Which I understand.
[179:04.54]It's a competitive game.
[179:07.42]Wait, why won't you play Deadlock?
[179:09.52]It's fun!
[179:10.24]Because Deadlock's a crash-out game.
[179:12.28]I don't want to play it.
[179:13.34]I can't.
[179:15.46]Oh, I've been called so many mean names in Deadlock.
[179:18.43]I'm not even saying other people.
[179:19.63]It's one of those games... I heard it's really hard to do well if you play against good players.
[179:29.02]Look, if they come out with a shithead queue, maybe.
[179:32.31]yeah yeah as of right now everyone who's playing it is just way better than me so I'm waiting for that shithead q2 I am not good enough but that's why people hate me hate playing with me on my team because they're like wow what the you're terrible it's fine if you aren't I still like it though it's still fun
[179:57.75]Yeah, somebody said, it's fun if you aren't fragile.
[179:59.30]I feel like you saying that already is me... I've already been made fun of in the lobby, and we're playing Ninja Turtles.
[180:08.96]Right.
[180:09.26]You're saying you're fragile?
[180:11.62]Somebody in chat said that it's not bad if you're not fragile.
[180:16.23]Oh, oh.
[180:17.05]Yeah, that chatter is really cool.
[180:19.59]That's going to be the toughest chatter ever.
[180:21.27]But I feel like you were in the game with me right now, and I, like, fucked up capturing the point, and you just said that I'm fragile.
[180:31.62]Yeah.
[180:31.74]It's like, what the fuck?
[180:35.49]Oh, no.
[180:36.13]I don't know how to kill these things, Jerma.
[180:37.55]These little bugs.
[180:38.91]Jump.
[180:39.45]Jump here.
[180:41.26]Okay Wait, can we damage each other?
[180:45.22]I feel I thought we could oh, yeah Gotta test your theory Okay, perfect
[181:04.43]Sewer level, huh?
[181:05.75]It's like a Miyazaki game.
[181:07.45]This one goes on forever.
[181:08.51]I feel like it's for looping or something.
[181:11.68]We have done the same hallway like three times.
[181:14.12]Yeah, that's new.
[181:17.56]We got to be getting close.
[181:18.46]I think there's probably another one more level after this.
[181:22.13]Oh, for sure.
[181:23.25]And this was no, I mean, NES games can be long.
[181:27.47]Wait, did you ever play Toy Story 1, Jerma?
[181:31.42]The game?
[181:31.90]No.
[181:32.46]Yeah.
[181:33.30]Oh, man.
[181:34.06]That is the hardest game.
[181:35.32]I think it came out on the NES.
[181:37.26]But, like, you should try playing it.
[181:39.09]It's like that and Aladdin.
[181:41.03]It was so difficult.
[181:43.29]Or maybe I was just terrible.
[181:44.77]But I remember playing that and just, like, it would make me cry.
[181:48.26]It was so ridiculously hard.
[181:51.46]It's like a Deadlock experience, but single player.
[181:53.87]Is that the Genesis?
[181:56.23]Someone remind me.
[181:57.25]I forget what I played it on.
[181:59.57]Yeah, I'm on a huge old games kick, because last time we talked about it, actually I was talking to you, it was like a month or so ago, whenever we talked about it last time, just about how the age of what is considered retro or old is going to start to change.
[182:17.24]Yeah, yeah, I remember.
[182:20.14]And I just want to make sure that the things that I know I want, like, you know what, I want a Super Nintendo, I want to make sure I own one.
[182:25.92]I just want one now because I don't know in another 10 years how many people are going to be selling Super Nintendos anymore.
[182:33.76]It's going to be like the Atari.
[182:35.68]Yeah, it's going to be like extremely rare.
[182:38.39]Like it doesn't even feel real.
[182:39.81]Like even like when I talk about Super Nintendo, everyone's like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[182:45.71]People are like, remember GameCube or Wii?
[182:47.97]It's so retro.
[182:48.98]It freaks me out.
[182:50.96]Dude, this guy sucks.
[182:53.56]No, we're so good.
[182:54.38]Look at us.
[182:56.71]Oh, he heard us.
[183:02.90]Wait, we must be missing something.
[183:04.18]We must be missing something.
[183:06.08]No, wait, that was the best boss ever.
[183:07.90]I think we speed ran it.
[183:09.75]Somebody at my work never heard of a DS before.
[183:11.51]It happened on this stream like a few, four or five months ago.
[183:16.81]So I have a 3DO and it's one of my favorite consoles because I had just how dumb it was and all the FMV games and how like weird it is.
[183:22.94]Um, there were people that didn't know what a 3DO was.
[183:25.98]I was just like, wait, what is, what's a 3DO?
[183:27.47]And I'm like, wait, what?
[183:28.13]Oh god.
[183:28.71]I was like, you don't know what the 3DO?
[183:30.23]I was like, wait, didn't we, I played it on stream like five years ago.
[183:33.32]Didn't we all play it?
[183:34.65]Yeah, yeah.
[183:34.89]And it's like, who the fuck knows about a 3DO, dude?
[183:36.77]Like, nobody cares.
[183:37.49]And I'm like, whoa.
[183:38.56]That's crazy.
[183:38.96]Oh shit.
[183:40.89]Yeah, it's weird that people don't remember.
[183:42.65]Like, I even remember going into, uh, EB Games and playing the N-Gage, like, you know, the phone console.
[183:49.90]I feel like that was so recent.
[183:51.08]People are like, what the fuck is the N-Gage?
[183:52.93]That's right, yeah.
[183:55.11]I remember playing, like, Tomb Raider on it or something.
[183:57.33]It was awesome.
[183:58.19]Dude, do you think it's... Okay, do you think... Is it gonna be weird?
[184:02.38]If it's going to be, why am I saying is it gonna be?
[184:04.76]Think about this.
[184:06.12]We're at the PS5 right now, the Sony PlayStation 5.
[184:09.76]That is the current iteration of the console.
[184:12.97]Are they going to just do the Jason movies?
[184:16.69]And will they be a PlayStation 14?
[184:21.24]And imagine... No, surely not.
[184:23.20]Imagine when the PlayStation 14 comes out.
[184:27.45]Is growing up with a PlayStation 14 odd?
[184:31.48]Because you're, it's like, wait, it's the 14th one?
[184:35.32]Because growing up with PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, it's like, okay, that's 1, 2.
[184:40.55]Is it going to be weird to... It's going to be like Final Fantasy fans.
[184:44.54]They're going to be like, oh, we're on 14 Part 2.
[184:47.38]I'm sure it'll be strange.
[184:48.58]iPhone 16, right?
[184:49.95]Is it going to be iPhone, like, 30?
[184:52.21]Is it going to keep going?
[184:54.46]When do we do something?
[184:55.56]Like, Switch 2, right?
[184:56.55]Okay, that's Switch 2.
[184:58.51]Is it always going to be the PlayStation?
[185:01.49]They're gonna rebrand at some point.
[185:03.77]Xbox, they just were like, nah, this one is one.
[185:07.07]Right.
[185:07.35]But sure, this is the 19th console.
[185:10.07]Nah, it's one.
[185:11.06]That's true.
[185:11.62]And think of how weird, for anybody that's growing up 10 years from now, think of how weird it is looking back at the old consoles and being like, wait, there was this thing called the Microsoft Xbox.
[185:21.39]And here's the one.
[185:22.55]So that's the first one?
[185:23.67]No, wait a minute.
[185:24.73]This was 40 years ago.
[185:26.27]No, Xbox One was different.
[185:28.13]But why do they call it one?
[185:29.37]Try to explain to the next generation, quote unquote, new Super Mario Brothers, when it's a 30-year-old game.
[185:35.83]How are you going to explain that?
[185:37.51]Well, you see, there was a game that came out.
[185:39.63]It was called the New Super Mario Bros.
[185:41.89]It's like, what?
[185:43.18]There's no, it's a, you know, what's going to happen to the next one?
[185:46.94]New Super Mario Brothers Wii U.
[185:53.65]What about the 360?
[185:54.25]Yeah, I'm just saying, like, eventually, if we keep making digestible, interactive media, which I don't think we're going to, I don't know if it's going to stop.
[186:02.80]Yeah.
[186:03.58]In 50 years, there's going to be, like, 70 versions of these consoles, and it's going to, growing up with that's a little strange.
[186:11.39]I have a prediction, Jeremy.
[186:14.14]I predict that they're going to call one of their consoles in the next, like, 20 years the PlayStation or the Xbox.
[186:21.68]And you think they'll just keep it that way forever?
[186:23.76]Yeah.
[186:24.20]It will just be the PlayStation now.
[186:26.26]Yeah.
[186:26.82]And then they'll restart and they'll be like, this is the new PlayStation 2.
[186:29.69]Would it be new PlayStation 2 or would they just say PlayStation 2 again?
[186:32.87]I think they would just say PlayStation 2 because people are going to forget.
[186:35.79]Oh, sorry.
[186:37.21]I paused.
[186:38.55]Fuck, that's true.
[186:39.42]That's weird.
[186:40.78]Isn't that weird?
[186:41.40]Like even Xbox One is crazy to name a console because I'm thinking about, you know, the Xbox like with the old Xbox with Halo 1 on it.
[186:51.48]like whenever I hear that but people forgot I guess so they can just re-release it it's interesting because having those having the milestones of of product and and technology and dude Game Boy I remember when I was like 12. like it was like walk and jump and it was gray and the screen was green
[187:16.01]I feel like when I was a little kid, that, like, made sense to me.
[187:18.54]Because as a little kid, it's, I only know how to, like, walk, jump, and green screen.
[187:23.85]I don't know, I don't, I don't know fucking anything else.
[187:25.50]I know how to eat and, like, jump and, like, laugh.
[187:29.27]Yeah.
[187:29.58]I wonder, digesting, like, HD graphics when I was, like, 10?
[187:36.35]I don't know.
[187:37.77]No, you would have.
[187:38.49]I mean, I'm playing Minecraft right now, and kids play Minecraft.
[187:41.88]It's so complicated.
[187:43.56]I don't understand.
[187:45.14]But is that going to make kids smarter?
[187:46.76]Like, is that going to make kids smarter?
[187:49.20]Like, oh, hey, what do you mean?
[187:51.93]Of course I made an entire world in Redstone.
[187:53.73]I invented electricity in my game.
[187:56.31]You did?
[187:56.77]You're like 11.
[187:57.55]Yeah, I invented electricity.
[187:59.78]It's like, what the fuck?
[188:01.62]Even like, I know people cringe on these Minecraft movies or whatever that people put on YouTube.
[188:06.60]A lot of work goes into that.
[188:08.21]Like, that's impressive for someone young to make.
[188:11.49]Or is it making everybody way stupider?
[188:15.32]And there's arguments to be made.
[188:19.84]You know, I think it makes people smarter.
[188:22.76]Like, I think the kids now are smarter than when we were kids.
[188:27.53]But there's a cost to it.
[188:29.07]Like, they're a little aware that maybe that's not good for their brain, but they're definitely, they're definitely no more in general stuff.
[188:38.53]Well, yeah, I feel like having, like, all the, because I think, just think of the technology that, just that you grew up with.
[188:45.54]It barely, it's sometimes you have to blow in it to make it work.
[188:48.98]You know what I mean?
[188:49.50]Like, oh, hold on.
[188:51.02]Yeah.
[188:51.73]No, that didn't work.
[188:52.73]You have to try it again.
[188:53.41]Hold on, son.
[188:54.03]What you have to do is you have to put two fucking cartridges into the console at the same time.
[188:58.18]You have to wedge it in.
[188:59.40]You have to wedge the console in.
[189:01.46]And it might break, but, like, oh, look, it turned on.
[189:05.11]I feel like that's all I knew.
[189:07.27]Even, like, memory cards were, like, blocks that you had to put into your console.
[189:10.94]Like, it wasn't, like, there was no theoretical, like, cloud saves or anything.
[189:15.09]I don't know.
[189:15.89]Do you think everything will just go to the cloud?
[189:18.60]Will there not be a PlayStation 12?
[189:20.75]It'll just be PlayStation and you have a screen that can just do whatever you want on it that's not a console.
[189:27.03]Yeah, for sure.
[189:28.13]I mean, it just, the internet, you know, technology has to get better for data to go over.
[189:33.94]And yeah, why not?
[189:35.47]I think that's just what's going to happen.
[189:37.13]But the problem is that you won't own anything.
[189:39.62]Like, remember, we're talking about physical disks and how amazing they are.
[189:42.34]That's just like not, right now it's a pipe dream, but even in the future, it's just going to be like,
[189:48.83]completely uh antiquated idea yeah physical media is it it is going to be antiquated it's it's it's really interesting to think about it even like dvds like there's no DVD rack that people go to it's so weird to me yeah holy this is like a firing what are we supposed to do here slowly oh the game could not handle this part
[190:14.72]But it's interesting, it's cool, and it's weird to think about that there will be like a 30th version of the PlayStation potentially, and somebody is going to grow up with that.
[190:24.15]And it's like, it's just something about that is just strange in a way.
[190:29.20]It's like we've progressed so far technologically that it ain't just like the Ninja Turtles in 2D fucking with, you have to blow in the cartridge and fucking use toothpaste on your scratch discs.
[190:43.58]Oh my God, I forgot about that.
[190:46.26]Dude, scratch disks ruining games is... I haven't thought about that in years.
[190:51.55]Yeah, somebody said that in chat.
[190:52.61]They just reminded me of it.
[190:55.75]Yeah, but also at the same time when we were lucky because when we were young, each console was so vastly different.
[191:03.13]Like 3D graphics is so huge.
[191:05.23]I mean, look at the iPhone now.
[191:06.51]It's like the new ones are incrementally better.
[191:09.70]I feel like we've hit an upper limit.
[191:11.86]But when we were young, every console was like, holy, holy shit.
[191:15.97]There's motion controls.
[191:17.71]Like, that's insane.
[191:18.97]You can't even fathom that.
[191:20.48]The Resident Evil 4 on the Wii was, it changed everything.
[191:25.45]I was like, this changes everything.
[191:27.57]This is the greatest thing ever.
[191:28.43]It was awesome.
[191:29.59]It was awesome.
[191:30.52]It was so cool.
[191:31.04]It was so cool.
[191:32.48]But I remember in the Wii commercials, they would show like young people like hiding behind their sofa and jumping out playing Metroid Prime.
[191:40.77]And then you buy the Wii and people are just sitting on their couches, flicking their wrists, basically playing tennis.
[191:48.04]It was so upsell, you know, like, you know.
[191:52.27]Yeah.
[191:52.45]And maybe like, oh, maybe it would be VR.
[191:54.39]I don't think it is.
[191:55.11]I don't think it is.
[191:56.11]It's all around us.
[191:59.21]No.
[192:00.00]Have you ever tried like a VR thing?
[192:02.16]Oh yeah, I played a ton of VR.
[192:04.89]Yeah, it just makes me... It's just so active.
[192:07.98]It gets me tired.
[192:09.87]Yeah, it takes a while.
[192:10.63]My brain can't handle it.
[192:13.32]Yeah, Half- Alyx was amazing though.
[192:15.82]I think that was probably one of the only experiences.
[192:19.16]What's the sword game where you fight with a sword and it's crazy?
[192:24.51]Oh, oh, oh.
[192:26.07]Not super hot.
[192:27.20]No, no, no.
[192:28.60]Blade and... What's it called?
[192:30.36]Blade and swords?
[192:32.20]Blade and sorcery.
[192:33.15]Blade and swords.
[192:33.99]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[192:34.65]Is that in VR?
[192:35.47]I didn't know that.
[192:36.07]Yeah, it's awesome in VR.
[192:37.29]It's amazing.
[192:38.14]Oh, shit.
[192:38.42]I have to try that.
[192:43.84]Hey, look at us.
[192:44.97]Look at all this philosophical gamer talk.
[192:47.15]I know.
[192:49.03]I guess we're old now.
[192:50.68]But I remember I was, like, dreaming in VR.
[192:52.58]Is that weird to say?
[192:53.60]What do you mean?
[192:55.41]Like, when I was playing VR, I was playing Half-Life Alyx.
[192:58.81]My dreams would be, like, I would dream about, like, when I'm asleep.
[193:04.73]Like, VR dreams.
[193:06.59]stuff I saw in VR was like indistinguishable from real life it was so strange oh that's weird I like I know I looked it up and apparently it's like a really common phenomenon for some people whoa that's weird that's crazy it's very weird like I experienced things in that game that in my subconscious felt real that's what yeah I would that would freak me out I'm if I stopped playing I just beat half my box I never did VR again
[193:32.29]Yeah, that would be awful.
[193:34.73]Yeah, it was very strange, but apparently common.
[193:42.74]But yeah, TL;DR, if you just like skip through that whole conversation, you just got to right here.
[193:48.67]I'd like, if I see an Atari game that's like fucking five bucks, I was gonna get it.
[193:56.72]I was gonna get it.
[194:00.44]Same with Rollercoaster Tycoon.
[194:02.74]True, yeah.
[194:03.50]Get the box.
[194:05.38]Yeah, the box.
[194:06.32]I remember the boxes that, you know, I would just always look at.
[194:14.81]Dreaming in third person.
[194:17.65]How do we dodge these, by the way?
[194:19.31]I think some of them you have to jump over and some of them are higher, so you have to just stay down.
[194:22.03]Oh, I can't tell.
[194:25.09]Like, this is high?
[194:25.73]And that's low?
[194:26.80]I think that one was low.
[194:27.50]This one's high.
[194:28.06]This one's low.
[194:29.50]Medium?
[194:31.56]It alternates.
[194:33.63]I see.
[194:36.22]Alright, are we... Do we have to walk forward?
[194:39.44]No, we're just on a... We're on a... Nah, there we go.
[194:44.50]Look at the background.
[194:45.52]When you're moving, the background's like... Like buffering on the right.
[194:48.81]It's so cool.
[194:54.83]This game's awesome.
[194:56.13]This one's great.
[194:57.49]This one's really good.
[194:59.10]This one feels really good to play.
[195:00.82]Even with the lag.
[195:03.64]I think we're pretty close.
[195:04.32]I think this is the last level.
[195:07.26]God, let's freaking do it.
[195:08.30]It only took two tries.
[195:10.99]Oh, here they come.
[195:12.53]Just one.
[195:18.96]Oh my god.
[195:19.38]He's kind of crazy.
[195:22.70]The audio is glitching for me now.
[195:25.46]Yeah, I can hear it too.
[195:31.53]Where's his hitbox?
[195:33.86]Oh, that's huge.
[195:35.66]That's actually huge.
[195:40.99]Jump diving in this game is insanely good, by the way, I feel like.
[195:45.67]Like, even spamming it.
[195:46.60]Oh.
[195:53.86]Damn.
[195:56.09]Gotta get him in the corner.
[195:58.21]Yeah, I don't know how to, like, push him.
[196:01.61]Oh, here.
[196:02.05]Here's a perfect.
[196:03.20]Nope.
[196:05.97]In this game, you have to dodge more.
[196:07.75]Like, you can't, like, interrupt.
[196:09.86]Like, the last game, if you hit X and they were doing a combo, they would stop fighting.
[196:14.40]He's not even blinking.
[196:18.38]No.
[196:18.54]Dude, I'm doing so much damage.
[196:20.49]I would go over there and I'd hurt you if I went over there.
[196:24.67]Oh.
[196:28.83]Oh my god, he's a million health.
[196:31.59]No lies, by the way, from both of us.
[196:34.04]I feel like we've hit him so many times.
[196:37.12]Oh no!
[196:43.27]There we go, alright.
[196:44.11]He's almost dead.
[196:48.48]We're both pretty one HP here.
[196:55.08]Oh, die!
[196:56.21]Oh no!
[196:57.11]He's tori- I'm one hit!
[197:03.91]It's over for me.
[197:05.82]Oh no.
[197:09.73]Was he attacking?
[197:11.01]He's freaking me out!
[197:11.53]What's he doing?
[197:12.11]Oh my god!
[197:12.53]Wait, he's attacking my dead body!
[197:14.03]I think he's glitched!
[197:17.82]Oh shit, that's so awesome that that happened!
[197:19.86]That was insane!
[197:21.26]Let's freaking go!
[197:25.04]Okay.
[197:25.42]That was a hard boss.
[197:27.57]You can come back.
[197:30.17]And we're going to need to come back because we're at Shredder.
[197:32.41]Oh, here we go.
[197:36.81]I love that they can only target one person, but they can still turn around and attack for the second.
[197:42.38]There's going to be all you.
[197:44.82]Oh, no.
[197:46.32]What was that?
[197:53.11]Oh, no.
[197:57.53]OK, we we should exchange attacks, so like you attack now when he's aiming for me and run away.
[198:01.83]Yep.
[198:01.93]And then now I attack.
[198:03.28]Oh, I'm dead.
[198:05.04]OK.
[198:06.83]He's okay now he's confused.
[198:08.39]He's fucked up.
[198:08.92]He's fucked up.
[198:09.62]Okay.
[198:10.44]Ah You got this No, how do I There you go, but flame like a Dark Souls enemy Oh
[198:34.42]That animation tracking is such bullshit.
[198:36.29]He's literally going back when you walk forward.
[198:38.19]Yeah, he's copying my inputs.
[198:51.45]Oh no.
[198:51.59]Oh god.
[198:51.75]Yeah, that's bullshit.
[198:53.37]He's just out of range.
[198:58.84]Even for Donatello, that's crazy.
[199:00.20]He has the biggest breach in the game.
[199:05.54]Oh no.
[199:07.36]There's no way.
[199:08.00]Dude, if the last guy had that much HP, like the one before him, he's going to be... He's going to have so much.
[199:17.42]We have one more continue.
[199:18.74]I wonder if it puts us right there.
[199:22.30]Otherwise, it's ghost pepper time.
[199:24.69]Alright, I'm going to be Michelangelo.
[199:27.17]Okay, I'll be Raph.
[199:29.31]Raphael.
[199:31.84]Okay, so it's the last scene we just did.
[199:35.22]Oh, don't tell me.
[199:36.37]Oh, so this is just the boss.
[199:38.05]Is it just the boss?
[199:39.61]I hope so.
[199:40.25]Otherwise, we have to fight that other guy again.
[199:41.95]I think we have to fight the other guy again.
[199:44.04]Oh, damn.
[199:45.36]Well, this is our last opportunity.
[199:48.59]We can do it.
[199:50.83]Oh, whoa.
[199:51.05]We got three lives each.
[199:51.97]Look at this move.
[199:53.71]That's using health.
[199:54.43]That's using health.
[199:55.62]Oh, shit.
[199:59.88]Dude, I'm spamming it.
[200:00.72]I'm showing off.
[200:02.27]Oh no.
[200:02.87]You need to keep that HP high.
[200:04.92]Right, right, right, right, right.
[200:12.41]Oh no.
[200:17.13]Oh!
[200:19.44]We're good.
[200:23.82]And let's stay on opposite sides of the screen too, just so we don't hurt each other.
[200:27.02]Yeah, true.
[200:28.43]Yeah, go on the left.
[200:35.40]I've got the best side of the screen.
[200:36.90]This is awesome.
[200:41.21]Alright, let's knock that one back that way so we both have one.
[200:44.85]Well, I got two.
[200:45.65]Well, you got... No, we're good.
[200:46.63]What?
[200:46.83]I got... Oh, oh.
[200:50.80]Oh, shit.
[200:51.04]I thought they were helpers.
[200:52.26]Ow.
[200:54.24]Okay.
[200:55.99]Come on, Shredder.
[200:59.53]That's such a great name.
[201:00.27]I'm Shredder.
[201:01.17]Shredder sounds so menacing.
[201:04.27]Okay, what would be your villain name?
[201:07.28]Like, what would be your Star Wars villain name?
[201:09.34]Like, Darth... Smoke.
[201:14.81]Holy shit.
[201:16.19]Is that Darth Smoke?
[201:18.74]And he can just disappear.
[201:20.02]That's pretty legit.
[201:23.40]Darth Smoke.
[201:24.80]Darth Smoke.
[201:26.33]Yeah, that actually sounds way cool.
[201:27.81]That sounds really awesome.
[201:29.95]But people think of, like, cigarettes.
[201:32.15]Then you have to have, like, a do not do drugs warning whenever Darth Smoke comes up.
[201:36.94]No, that is... He's hotboxing his helmet.
[201:39.33]It's Darth Smoke.
[201:41.87]Dude, this is probably... This is probably, like, a DJ that, like, fucking smokes weed on stage and, like, he's Darth Smoke.
[201:49.04]That'd be sick.
[201:50.46]Now, ladies and gentlemen, introducing the entertainment for the evening.
[201:53.29]Get ready to get fucking pumped up.
[201:55.69]Darth Smoke.
[201:57.25]And he's got like a... Oh, man.
[201:59.81]He has like a helmet with RGB lighting in it.
[202:03.52]Yeah.
[202:04.72]And like marijuana smoke comes out of the bottom of it every so often.
[202:09.30]That'd be sick.
[202:10.08]Dude, you're just describing a marshmallow.
[202:12.89]That already exists, dude.
[202:16.43]Okay, this is bad.
[202:17.47]I'm stuck here.
[202:18.96]Oh, you can't go to the bottom of the screen?
[202:20.82]Yeah, I'll try to interrupt.
[202:23.31]Don't get both pizzas.
[202:25.31]I'm saving one.
[202:26.15]It looked like you were going for both pizzas.
[202:27.87]I freaked out.
[202:28.45]No, no, no.
[202:30.17]We're a team.
[202:30.55]Look, we have full health, full lives.
[202:33.64]This is going good.
[202:37.38]Okay, these ones you just dodge?
[202:39.40]I don't know what.
[202:40.35]I don't even know how you're supposed to hit those guys.
[202:42.91]Yeah, just don't even.
[202:43.73]Don't even get yourself hurt.
[202:49.57]I hate these little floating things.
[202:51.64]Come up here because you can actually hit them from up here.
[202:53.68]Ah, okay.
[202:54.06]That makes sense.
[202:55.16]That's why.
[202:55.62]I was like, I can't figure it out.
[202:59.41]What did you call these things?
[203:00.35]Boats?
[203:01.51]Floaty, floaty, you know, floaty objects.
[203:05.60]They're like bugs?
[203:06.52]What are they?
[203:07.16]They're kind of like bugs.
[203:07.90]Laser bugs.
[203:10.18]Machine robot bugs.
[203:12.32]They look like they would be in the Sonic game.
[203:15.45]Yeah, they do.
[203:16.91]You a Sonic fan?
[203:18.31]Oh, yeah.
[203:20.23]I love the original Sonic.
[203:21.68]I mean, I don't like the new ones, to be honest.
[203:24.52]But wait, can I have a theory why you never were?
[203:27.70]Because when I was a kid, you were either a Genesis kid or a Nintendo kid.
[203:32.47]Never both.
[203:33.77]That's true.
[203:35.34]So you probably like the Nintendo more.
[203:37.53]I was.
[203:37.89]I was a Super Nintendo.
[203:39.76]NES and Super Nintendo were my main consoles.
[203:42.06]Yes.
[203:42.84]I never had a Genesis, but I'd go to my friend's house to play Sonic, and I'd hog the controller.
[203:48.95]Actually, it was kind of awesome.
[203:50.60]If you were of one of the other console affiliations, and you went to somebody's house that had a Genesis, it was like a special treat.
[203:59.47]It was like, whoa, it was an alien.
[204:00.81]It was another world.
[204:02.05]Yeah.
[204:03.05]Yeah, because no one would have one, really.
[204:07.26]They'd be like, whoa, you spent your money on this?
[204:14.45]Oh, no.
[204:16.31]Yeah, we got to... This same problem happened last time to us.
[204:19.31]They're so strong.
[204:21.24]They turn around in just like one hit.
[204:23.48]Those are crazy.
[204:30.60]I'm gonna guess they're coming out of this next?
[204:32.97]I would hope so.
[204:33.65]Nope.
[204:36.00]Oh!
[204:36.68]As soon as I walk away, of course.
[204:40.51]How did you punch me that far?
[204:41.73]You're just a regular guy.
[204:42.73]There we go.
[204:50.26]You knew anybody with a weird console, like a TurboGrafx or a 3DO?
[204:53.95]Back then, no.
[204:54.93]No.
[204:55.15]Yeah, no.
[204:55.93]You either?
[204:56.27]No.
[204:56.35]I don't think so.
[204:57.60]No.
[204:58.52]I really don't.
[204:59.28]I only play these things at, like, EB Games, I swear.
[205:01.70]Yeah.
[205:02.84]Otherwise they wouldn't exist, because they were so expensive.
[205:05.85]Yeah.
[205:06.01]Like, it's a huge investment.
[205:07.69]And, like, the TurboGrafx to me was just the one weird console that was in the glass down there that I never even cared to even look at.
[205:14.69]Yeah.
[205:15.41]no for sure even that Nintendo um it's so embarrassing I don't remember what it's called what's the Nintendo VR what's it called again uh virtual boy yeah virtual boy it was like it felt like not real to me I remember playing that when I was younger and thinking it was the coolest thing ever yeah the future is here
[205:37.41]But then, after playing the only Mario game on there that I got to play was the Mario Tennis one.
[205:43.66]I didn't even get to play a regular Mario game on it.
[205:46.27]Dude, that sounds sickening.
[205:47.63]Mario Tennis on the virtual.
[205:49.69]It was.
[205:49.85]That sounds absolutely nauseating.
[205:52.07]It was horrible.
[205:52.70]That's like Tesla levels.
[205:56.90]Yeah, apparently it was garbage, that console.
[205:59.33]It was not good.
[206:01.56]Yeah, but it was cool.
[206:03.48]The one opportunity I really had to play it was the only opportunity and the only time I ever did play it hardware-wise, like in person.
[206:11.69]Yeah, I've never even put it on.
[206:13.90]I've never seen it since.
[206:14.72]I've seen gameplay of it.
[206:16.68]I've seen people playing it just, you know, on YouTube videos and stuff, but... Alright, here we go.
[206:21.03]Have you ever played the Wii U?
[206:22.89]I have a Wii U. I do too.
[206:24.85]I love the Wii U. I...
[206:28.10]I wouldn't go that far.
[206:28.96]I don't think I love the Wii U. Well, that's when I played Mario Maker, though.
[206:33.27]Oh, I'm getting owned.
[206:34.69]Mario Maker was the reason to own that.
[206:37.47]It's perfect on the Wii U. And then I have this game collection where... I forget what it's called.
[206:45.08]Not Wii Play, but it was so fun.
[206:48.23]I don't know.
[206:48.71]I love the Wii.
[206:50.45]That's how I play Breath of the Wild, too, so maybe I'm just biased.
[206:53.87]I played Breath of the Wild recently, like a couple, two or three years ago.
[206:59.54]Oh, I remember.
[207:00.04]You streamed it.
[207:01.28]Yeah.
[207:02.27]Yes, yes.
[207:04.75]You ever played Tears in the Kingdom?
[207:06.61]No, I have not.
[207:08.21]Me neither.
[207:10.12]I, like, don't want to for some weird reason.
[207:12.58]I don't really want to either.
[207:13.66]It's not that I have anything against it.
[207:15.45]I just don't want to.
[207:17.61]No, that's how I feel.
[207:18.67]I kind of wish they did, like, a traditional Zelda game.
[207:21.45]I don't know why.
[207:23.34]Oh shoot.
[207:24.96]Alright, we gotta be careful here.
[207:27.90]This is so cruel that they put a boss right before this boss.
[207:30.80]Yeah, and it's like a tanky boss too.
[207:34.77]Ah.
[207:41.89]Come on, I can't get the hitbox right there.
[207:44.44]It's tough also because I don't want to hit you.
[207:46.14]So I'm like, you're up and I'm going to be playing it a little safe.
[207:54.18]Alright, we're good.
[207:55.73]Getting there.
[207:58.39]Oh, man.
[208:04.86]He does two swings?
[208:09.06]How is he not dead?
[208:11.75]There we go.
[208:13.23]Let's fight Shredder.
[208:20.78]We can do this.
[208:21.42]Last time we had zero lives, right?
[208:22.92]We got this.
[208:25.74]Alright, just play safe.
[208:30.61]Same strategy like you said before, whoever he's looking at.
[208:32.49]And don't go greedy.
[208:34.52]Only get like one or two hits.
[208:38.20]Oh my god.
[208:43.99]Oh, he's targeting me?
[208:45.80]Ugh.
[208:59.78]His tracking is unbelievably good.
[209:01.42]He does have insane tracking.
[209:02.70]It's insane.
[209:08.47]Okay, he's on me.
[209:25.97]That was a mistake.
[209:26.53]I shouldn't have jumped in.
[209:30.61]That move is so hard to avoid.
[209:32.53]I don't even know what to do there.
[209:33.61]I guess jump away?
[209:35.69]Maybe go up, yeah.
[209:40.88]He's targeting me.
[209:43.40]Targeting you.
[209:53.00]You can take my life.
[209:54.72]I got two.
[209:57.68]Wait, I'm the one with one?
[210:00.05]I think I got next to life.
[210:02.24]Oh, I was going to say, I thought I was doing you a favor.
[210:04.46]I was like, go ahead, Jeremiah.
[210:05.62]Take mine.
[210:06.38]You can now take my life.
[210:08.89]He's still not blinking, so we've got to be careful.
[210:12.03]Yeah, yeah.
[210:12.87]We're hitting him so much.
[210:17.12]Yeah, definitely move up.
[210:17.90]Nice, good dodge.
[210:22.14]Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
[210:23.37]Out.
[210:25.69]Okay, I thought April was just going like, wow, that was awful.
[210:28.43]Like shaking her head at us.
[210:30.47]She seems not impressed by our fighting.
[210:34.22]I mean, it is a 1v2 and we're kind of getting our ass handed to us.
[210:38.21]Dude, how much health does he have?
[210:39.41]He's not even blinking.
[210:41.31]I feel like we've been hitting him for like 30 minutes.
[210:48.86]That's good.
[210:49.34]Wait, I feel like we're close.
[210:51.28]I do too.
[210:54.27]Maybe he doesn't blink.
[210:56.48]He just doesn't blink?
[210:57.34]Of all the bosses ever, you think he doesn't blink?
[210:59.99]Yeah, like, because it's the final boss, and it's like, you know, you just have to... He's blinking!
[211:03.81]Alright, get him.
[211:04.25]Just throw all care out the window.
[211:06.44]Just get in there.
[211:07.28]Go, go, go, go, go!
[211:08.56]We have health.
[211:08.96]We can do it.
[211:15.95]Dude, he's just... He's pre-aiming me.
[211:18.25]Just get him.
[211:18.71]Kill him.
[211:20.22]Nice!
[211:20.64]Let's freaking go!
[211:22.54]We did it.
[211:24.04]We actually did do it.
[211:25.44]And we didn't even have to start over.
[211:27.43]Oh, and no reruns.
[211:32.49]We did it.
[211:33.69]Thank you.
[211:34.96]Look.
[211:37.14]Isn't that Krang Spaceship in the sky above Manhattan Island?
[211:40.84]Uh-oh.
[211:42.13]Oh, secret boss.
[211:43.97]Super Shredder.
[211:46.37]Shredder's getting away.
[211:48.17]What?
[211:50.44]Or it's to set up the next game.
[211:53.24]Oh.
[211:54.43]Oh no.
[212:00.40]There's still more game.
[212:05.77]Let's freaking go.
[212:07.47]We're right at the top of Manhattan.
[212:09.77]What the fuck?
[212:12.97]This is sick.
[212:17.00]We both have a decent amount of lives.
[212:21.20]This console is chugging.
[212:23.00]I feel like I could hear it just in my head going, hmm.
[212:28.16]Like, look at how slow it is.
[212:31.17]I think it's because the memory fills up, right?
[212:34.09]For the actual cartridge itself.
[212:39.96]Holy shit, they flattened you.
[212:41.32]Don't be underneath them.
[212:42.66]Oh, shoot.
[212:43.74]Oh, you hit me.
[212:44.58]You killed me.
[212:45.50]Oh, my God.
[212:45.90]I'm so sorry.
[212:46.54]You murdered me.
[212:47.58]I didn't mean to do that.
[212:48.31]I'm sorry.
[212:49.61]Okay, so you have to wait for them to... Oh, you have to hit their saucer.
[212:56.76]There we go.
[212:59.15]Oh, no.
[213:01.45]It's alright.
[213:01.75]We're good.
[213:02.21]We're good.
[213:02.89]We're good.
[213:05.10]I'm gonna stay right.
[213:05.76]You stay left.
[213:06.86]Okay.
[213:10.44]It'd be great to get a life up right now.
[213:13.89]Holy shit.
[213:14.49]It was transparent on the screen.
[213:15.89]What?
[213:21.09]It's like a Mario Party minigame now.
[213:25.19]Oh no.
[213:30.00]Sometimes the shadows didn't show up.
[213:32.76]Yeah, it gets blended in.
[213:37.51]Oh, I'll stay on the left.
[213:38.47]Sorry.
[213:39.55]Oh shit.
[213:45.10]Dude, come on.
[213:46.18]Why can't I get him?
[213:48.25]Oh, you're on my side.
[213:50.42]Sorry.
[213:52.36]No!
[213:52.52]There we go.
[213:53.18]If we can get through this, we should be good.
[213:57.92]Oh, my God.
[213:59.19]I got to set up.
[214:00.95]We don't have any more continues.
[214:01.89]We're losing lives.
[214:04.35]Yeah, so if we lose, we have to start over.
[214:05.83]Yeah, in tournament fighters.
[214:09.96]Right.
[214:10.94]No, we have to start over in this game, of course.
[214:14.66]We did it.
[214:15.32]Surely there's no super boss battle.
[214:18.41]Blink a few times if you need to.
[214:35.32]There we go.
[214:37.30]Careful, these are the ice guys.
[214:38.29]What is this?
[214:42.47]I think they're just the same as the super ones down below, but they're just blue.
[214:47.62]They are, yeah.
[214:49.36]Literally, I hate these guys.
[214:52.04]Perfect.
[214:54.82]Now I'm interested in playing the new one of these.
[214:56.49]The old one's so good, and people love the new one.
[214:59.39]It's great.
[215:00.39]If you like this, if you like the two games we've played so far, then you should definitely play it.
[215:03.59]It's great.
[215:05.09]Yeah, I will.
[215:08.42]Did they make it longer?
[215:10.25]It's pretty long.
[215:11.71]It's got a lot of levels.
[215:15.50]Oh my god.
[215:16.12]They just teleported on the screen.
[215:19.42]That's why you just can't be on the right hand side.
[215:22.26]There's no way to react.
[215:26.19]Oh, now they're on the left side.
[215:30.15]This is wherever I'm not.
[215:31.67]Alright, I'm in the middle.
[215:34.31]We're good.
[215:35.90]Okay, clear.
[215:41.89]I feel an extra life coming here.
[215:43.57]Oh my god.
[215:44.91]You've been hit by everyone.
[215:47.16]So unlucky.
[215:48.72]We need at least one extra life.
[215:53.09]We do.
[215:54.95]Like, I don't even know.
[215:56.03]Because this is going to end in a boss battle, obviously.
[215:57.87]Oh shit.
[216:04.98]Those guys are so annoying.
[216:10.13]Come on, give us an extra life.
[216:13.92]Sometimes when you're in the air and you do a jump thing, they hit you, but other times they don't.
[216:22.83]I don't understand why that is.
[216:25.36]They just track you.
[216:27.08]Yeah, but I don't understand.
[216:28.42]I got one.
[216:29.38]You're about to get one at 10,000.
[216:32.17]Oh, perfect.
[216:34.11]Honestly, you should get all the kills now.
[216:36.99]Yeah.
[216:43.38]Okay.
[216:44.87]I don't know what these are.
[216:45.63]You're almost there.
[216:55.30]Definitely want you to have that before the boss.
[216:57.40]Yes.
[216:59.19]One more kill.
[216:59.61]Let's reboot.
[217:00.37]Two more.
[217:00.85]Last one.
[217:02.07]There we go.
[217:02.89]Let's freaking go.
[217:05.72]What's the next?
[217:07.10]Another one is 300,000?
[217:08.00]It might be 200,000.
[217:11.00]Oh, sorry.
[217:11.26]200,000 makes sense.
[217:12.73]That's actually kind of crazy.
[217:14.01]I don't even know if that's possible.
[217:18.26]I don't think it is possible right now.
[217:19.94]I think we just hit the last one.
[217:23.52]I would love... It's got to give us a cup.
[217:25.63]Give us a pizza.
[217:27.87]Oh, no.
[217:31.15]We need pizzas.
[217:36.54]This is a brutal stage, I feel like.
[217:40.83]oh no there's gonna be two pieces back on one oh are you serious yeah this level sucks this level is ridiculous okay are we good alright here's the boss
[218:02.24]actually probably is going to be krang and then super shredder again it might be crying again wait did we fight crank already yeah I think we did that was the last game though wasn't it no no no that was this game no what was this game right was it yeah yeah yeah he had a bunch of help wasn't it I was making that up
[218:30.66]What turtle game had the electric underwater seaweed?
[218:33.14]Uh, the first one, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the NES game.
[218:38.25]Just the first one they ever made.
[218:42.12]It's so laggy.
[218:45.62]You can whack those, uh, whatever shurikens back.
[218:49.93]Oh, okay.
[218:50.85]I didn't know that.
[218:51.25]I was just trying to dodge.
[218:54.40]Okay, now it's the boss battle.
[218:56.32]Nope.
[218:57.20]Hahaha.
[218:58.99]Hey, I'm happy we just got this far.
[219:01.17]Me too.
[219:03.72]Foot.
[219:04.56]Foot.
[219:05.54]Well, don't touch it!
[219:07.30]Does it look like it was gonna do damage?
[219:12.06]It does, it just looks like a fun screen, oh my god!
[219:14.39]Yeah, it looks like I get a power-up or something, like some sort of buff.
[219:22.24]Nice.
[219:23.04]Watch out.
[219:24.38]What is this?
[219:24.94]I don't know what they're holding, but I don't like it.
[219:31.75]I was going to say foot.
[219:33.87]Because they're the foot clan.
[219:36.35]Oh.
[219:37.09]Oh, yes.
[219:37.77]Wait, you're right.
[219:39.82]You just thought there was this random, like, feet sign up here?
[219:42.34]I forgot.
[219:42.88]I forgot.
[219:43.76]I forgot about that.
[219:46.08]Yeah, I just thought it was, like, I don't know.
[219:47.44]What is it called?
[219:48.29]Foot.
[219:49.59]I just forgot.
[219:51.59]Oh, my God.
[219:52.37]The hitbox is huge.
[219:53.41]Just stay away from it.
[219:57.90]Oh, the shurikens.
[219:59.90]Spamming axe.
[220:01.73]They are not messing around.
[220:02.91]This is crazy.
[220:04.86]Yeah, this is like... We're both one or two lives, I guess, technically.
[220:14.31]Yeah, we have one more full bar each.
[220:16.71]Just imagine that this is the mob.
[220:18.81]Oh, come on.
[220:20.46]You're going to throw this guy at us?
[220:22.06]This is the turtle.
[220:25.70]Wait, the turtle wasn't the last guy.
[220:27.15]Oh, God.
[220:28.29]Oh boy, this is bad.
[220:29.92]This is very bad.
[220:30.76]Not looking good.
[220:31.52]Alright, I'm gonna walk in.
[220:38.49]Oh shit.
[220:44.91]He just punched me into the feet sign!
[220:48.64]Nope!
[220:53.80]There we go.
[220:54.26]Wait, there's some damage.
[220:55.07]It's not even blinking.
[220:59.48]Dude, he's insane!
[221:04.11]He's like late to a meeting or something.
[221:06.83]Look at the way he runs.
[221:09.18]It's actually honestly pretty cute.
[221:12.30]Okay, do not jump kick him.
[221:15.87]Okay, okay.
[221:16.87]He's spamming me in the corner.
[221:17.87]Let's do the same strategy we've done for the final boss.
[221:20.07]Okay, I'm going to stay on this side.
[221:26.77]He makes so much travel time.
[221:28.53]Oh my god.
[221:29.67]No, that's actually a bad strategy.
[221:31.43]Look at that travel time.
[221:35.16]Oh my god, he's teabagging.
[221:36.48]What was that about?
[221:37.26]He's taunting us.
[221:43.19]Oh no.
[221:46.07]I just don't know how to dodge some of his moves.
[221:51.15]No.
[221:53.90]Just play crazy conservative.
[221:59.71]If you don't have a guaranteed hit, just dodge him.
[222:03.63]Oh, you ran into the foot sign.
[222:07.45]We're good, we're good.
[222:11.10]Oh, it's a lot of damage!
[222:16.22]Uh-oh.
[222:23.75]Oh!
[222:24.15]No!
[222:24.27]The foot killed me!
[222:26.37]The foot sign!
[222:30.87]Oh no!
[223:05.21]Nice job.
[223:06.40]Oh, no.
[223:20.97]Oh, no.
[223:22.20]That was such a good try.
[223:24.26]Oh, nice freaking try, though.
[223:29.67]Oh, man.
[223:31.39]I count that as a win.
[223:32.95]I tried.
[223:33.87]That was beyond the freaking finish of the game.
[223:39.00]I thought he needed one more hit.
[223:42.22]Oh well.
[223:42.52]I bet you he was one hit away.
[223:44.18]Dude, some of those hits where you're jump attacking him while he was doing that move was so good.
[223:49.73]I was just trying to get it done.
[223:51.85]Yeah, it was so close.
[223:53.15]Too bad.
[223:56.11]I don't think we need to do it.
[223:57.08]There might be another level after that, honestly.
[223:59.91]yeah we'll do our ghost pepper challenge anyway yeah I mean we earned it we earned it wait now that's the prize for us we just switched the narrative alright you want to do uh you want to do tournament fighters yeah yeah let's do it I'm down this is the fighting one the fighting game this is the fighting game and then I I'm gonna take a quick break I'm gonna go pee and get a water okay I'm gonna get a snack too maybe like three four minutes

[229:25.82]Squidward.
[229:34.24]Do an impression of Jerma.
[229:35.54]Do you remember I think of an impression of Jerma?
[229:37.31]I just hear, I just go.
[229:40.35]That's what I think.
[229:42.53]I don't know why.
[229:43.13]It's not like a human impression.
[229:46.39]What the hell was that?
[229:47.19]I just sat down.
[229:48.22]Oh, hey, what's up?
[229:49.28]Sorry, I was just doing a halftime show.
[229:51.83]I heard you go... I can't do my mouth so dry.
[230:01.37]I just ate a pretzel.
[230:02.81]You can't make that sound if you eat a hard pretzel.
[230:05.58]No, no, you need... Yeah, it's... I've been eating... I just ate a whole egg.
[230:10.11]Oh, that sounds great.
[230:11.81]I have, like, a mug of boiled eggs.
[230:14.95]And, uh...
[230:16.27]Every time I'm hungry, I just, I put it, put an egg in a salad, eat the egg.
[230:20.53]It's just like a, it's a life changing thing.
[230:23.94]That sounds unironically amazing.
[230:26.16]It is hard boiled egg.
[230:27.92]Oh, hard boiled.
[230:29.04]And they're just like, as the week goes on, I make like a ton of eggs on Sunday and they're easy to store and they're healthy.
[230:34.73]I agree.
[230:35.77]I'm, I'm telling you the egg mug, it's, it's going to be the new thing.
[230:40.98]But egg mug.
[230:42.71]Yeah.
[230:42.89]Just a mug full of eggs.
[230:43.97]Like I have like a really huge mug every, every, uh, week.
[230:48.48]Every week.
[230:49.12]Yeah.
[230:50.18]Every week I make a, like a, I'm talking a dozen eggs.
[230:54.49]I love making egg salad.
[230:55.65]Egg salad's great.
[230:57.33]I'm eating one right now.
[230:58.67]Egg salad?
[231:00.63]Well, okay.
[231:01.51]You're thinking of an egg salad.
[231:02.64]I'm gonna have egg in my salad.
[231:05.90]No, that works too.
[231:07.36]Yeah.
[231:07.60]So it counts as an egg salad.
[231:09.44]I think that that's fair.
[231:10.45]That's a fair assessment.
[231:12.02]Okay, there you go.
[231:12.78]So that's my little snack.
[231:17.41]I almost ate a dog cookie.
[231:20.65]What do you mean?
[231:21.56]You were trying to get pretzels?
[231:22.80]I got a pretzel and then I got a dog cookie for Otto.
[231:26.58]And I did kind of, I switcherooed myself.
[231:29.73]So I was like, put that in one hand, swept it around, grabbed my water, put it.
[231:32.61]So I had the pretzel in my left hand, but then I moved it around a bunch and then I had the dog cookie in my left hand accidentally.
[231:40.12]And I raised it up and I said, wait, because texturally there were, it didn't throw anything off for me yet.
[231:45.67]Yes.
[231:46.01]Because I got a piece of a pretzel.
[231:46.99]I got like a big chunk of a pretzel.
[231:48.37]It kind of felt like it could have been a dog cookie.
[231:50.81]Sure.
[231:51.47]Can I ask you a question?
[231:53.12]Have you ever eaten a dog cookie before?
[231:54.80]No.
[231:58.04]I say, how about if we can't beat this next game?
[232:02.43]One of us eats a dog cookie?
[232:05.01]Well, there is, there's no, it would be a bet between you and me because it's a fighting game.
[232:10.80]Yeah, so how about if I beat you, you got to eat a dog cookie and a ghost pepper.
[232:16.30]Alright.
[232:17.53]If you beat me in this round, first round here, then I will eat a parody dog cookie.
[232:25.65]It's just an Oreo.
[232:26.69]You don't even try to get the texture right.
[232:29.92]You don't even try.
[232:30.78]I would actually respect that.
[232:32.68]Parody in title.
[232:36.08]Alright.
[232:36.64]Do you want me to make it or do you want to make it?
[232:38.62]Yes.
[232:39.12]I don't even know how to quit this.
[232:43.23]How do we get out of here?
[232:44.92]I think you can quit.
[232:48.32]I'll invite I'll see if I can pull you into this one.
[232:52.06]Okay.
[232:52.44]Oh, yeah, just send me an invite.
[232:53.43]There you go.
[233:01.30]You should see it now.
[233:04.20]It'll be a fondant dog cookie.
[233:10.72]The fondant dog cookie sounds awesome.
[233:13.18]I've eaten a fondant shoe.
[233:14.58]A chew?
[233:16.43]A fondant shoe.
[233:18.74]Oh, a shoe.
[233:20.88]You've got to explain to me what a fondant shoe is.
[233:23.68]I said, I told my chat that if the Three Stooges weren't in Fortnite within one year, then I would eat a shoe on camera because they were putting in Rick and Morty and the Terminator.
[233:32.94]And oh, look, it's fucking they put in everybody.
[233:36.92]And I was like, I still to this day believe the Three Stooges will be in Fortnite.
[233:40.55]I'm not going to give a timeline on it anymore.
[233:42.99]And it didn't happen, so I had to eat a shoe.
[233:47.68]And I ate a shoe on camera.
[233:49.67]And the shoe was made out of fondant.
[233:51.17]I gotcha.
[233:52.35]um but you remember when we were saying like retro things like people are gonna forget one day do you think the three stooges are gonna have the pull of rick and morty you know what I mean like what would the season be of the three stooges like are you gonna add a three stooges part of the map I mean honestly I think that'd be amazing but dude I don't think the three stooges have pull with anybody right now by the way who are you playing as oh I have my main armageddon
[234:19.71]I can't wait for the Leave it to Beaver update for Fortnite.
[234:22.99]I mean, they've been putting in so many people.
[234:26.81]They're going to run out of people to put in, so they're going to have to put in fucking Three Stooges.
[234:32.12]Dude, they're going to have to reach so far into the bag of ideas to get to the Three Stooges.
[234:38.11]Like, I think Mr. Bean could be in Fortnite.
[234:40.81]No, I'm telling you, the Three Stooges is not a weird thing.
[234:44.67]Oh, wait, hold on.
[234:46.16]To play.
[234:46.90]Am I playing?
[234:47.62]Oh, yeah, I am.
[234:49.58]Okay, A, I see.
[234:52.14]Okay, so you're a pro at this, obviously.
[234:54.68]This is like one of those games you're so good at.
[235:02.06]Okay.
[235:07.57]What, what's happening?
[235:08.51]What are you, what are you doing?
[235:12.07]What is happening?
[235:13.60]And enjoy the dog cookie.
[235:17.00]Oh, I don't even have a dog.
[235:19.18]That's so sad.
[235:24.27]Okay, how do you throw?
[235:30.40]Some people have moves.
[235:31.38]It's like, imagine like you're playing Street Fighter, but it's Ninja Turtles.
[235:35.77]Oh, okay, gotcha.
[235:36.63]I'm good now.
[235:40.54]Okay, so to block, you hold back?
[235:41.94]I see.
[235:42.44]Yep.
[235:46.92]Oh, I think that's my character's fault.
[235:48.80]There's no way I'm this bad.
[235:53.48]Headphone warning.
[235:54.08]I'm about to sneeze.
[235:54.74]I'm so sorry.
[235:58.01]There we go.
[235:58.53]That was not a headphone warning type sneeze.
[236:00.78]That was...
[236:02.07]A soft sneeze that was very gentle.
[236:06.70]You can make fun of me all you want, but the second you come after my sneeze, way too far, Buster.
[236:11.66]I didn't make fun of it.
[236:13.22]That was not a gentle sneeze.
[236:14.96]No, no, it was not.
[236:17.15]That was loud.
[236:18.17]It wasn't timid.
[236:21.17]I have a strong sneeze.
[236:23.35]All that came through the microphone was... We got the last part of that over here.
[236:30.98]okay maybe it was uh maybe it's like my my compressor because everyone knows it was a really loud sneeze on my end that was not the whole thing what is this what am I looking at here I don't know high scores okay I need to change my character yeah let's go with raf who I played the last ninja turtles game with maybe that'll transfer over and I'll be shredder
[236:55.73]No, no, please.
[236:58.24]Anybody but Treader.
[236:59.46]I can't fight that guy again.
[237:00.86]Now here he is.
[237:02.36]This one, hopefully this, you don't have as good as input matching.
[237:10.08]Okay, he's spamming.
[237:20.15]Was this game loved?
[237:21.97]Oh, people love this game.
[237:23.54]Yeah, I mean, I see... Look at the art.
[237:25.26]It looks amazing.
[237:28.54]Look at my freaking character.
[237:34.97]I'm trying to do one of his moves.
[237:38.78]How are you doing?
[237:39.28]I don't understand why I'm so bad.
[237:40.66]You have to do like Hadoukens.
[237:42.54]Like, you know, right, down, left.
[237:45.16]Right, down, left.
[237:45.92]Like that.
[237:48.35]Oh, there's like real combos.
[237:52.40]Oh, I see.
[237:53.24]Okay, okay.
[237:53.96]I didn't realize that.
[237:55.91]I think there is actually a move list.
[238:00.28]There must be, because I've just been doing basic inputs.
[238:03.78]Let's see.
[238:05.73]Like that.
[238:06.75]Whoa.
[238:13.62]Okay.
[238:22.51]There's no way, right?
[238:35.00]Yes!
[238:36.79]Let's go.
[238:40.89]Get moving.
[238:41.68]Do you have a CRT?
[238:42.42]Someone's asking about it.
[238:43.16]I used to have a CRT.
[238:44.24]It was just too big to move.
[238:45.86]What happened to it?
[238:47.09]I oh that's it was just when I moved to Vegas it was just so the thing was like 200 pounds there's no way I was taking it what's so funny people have like this romanticized view of crts but in reality there's such a pain in the ass like they were so annoying to like actually move with but man the refresh rates were high I mean there's now now see now regular monitors are just as good and and
[239:12.69]Way more portable.
[239:14.25]CRTs, I think eventually I want to get another one.
[239:17.50]But one I can actually travel with.
[239:24.97]A small one.
[239:27.15]How would you travel with a CRT?
[239:31.58]Something that fits in a suitcase?
[239:34.49]It would have to be one of those little 14 to 15 inch ones.
[239:38.80]Oh, so those are like really old.
[239:42.32]Yeah.
[239:42.56]Like one with an antenna on the top.
[239:44.97]And with a VCR on the bottom.
[239:47.71]Oh, hell yeah.
[239:48.37]I used to have that at the dentist.
[239:50.03]I would have a bunch of Disney movies.
[239:53.28]At the dentist?
[239:55.06]The dentist in the waiting room that have a CRT with like a stack of VCRs.
[240:00.17]Really?
[240:00.55]Or maybe I just had a really good dentist.
[240:02.89]That sounds awesome.
[240:04.00]Yeah.
[240:04.48]Oh, it was awesome.
[240:05.14]And then they had that toy where they would have a bunch of toys in the cars and stuff.
[240:10.74]It was such a fun time.
[240:12.32]I remember the toys.
[240:13.04]I remember after doing a good job at the dentist, they had this big chest and there was toys in it.
[240:19.70]And you got to pick a toy after you had your cleaning.
[240:22.49]Oh my god, wait, you're kidding.
[240:23.49]So after?
[240:24.23]So your parents would have to wait for you to play with toys before going home?
[240:29.00]That sounds terrible.
[240:30.08]Well, they were little McDonald's-style Happy Meal toys.
[240:33.92]Ah, I see, I see.
[240:35.33]It was all like a silly straw.
[240:37.99]Right.
[240:38.71]Or like those army men with parachutes.
[240:40.57]Exactly.
[240:41.69]Whoa, dude, those things were amazing.
[240:44.44]They would entertain me for hours.
[240:46.16]And honestly, it doesn't matter what it is.
[240:49.11]Like a silly straw.
[240:51.87]To a little kid, any object that you say is a toy is a piece of gold.
[240:57.16]It's an artifact to a little kid.
[240:59.62]I remember there was a... This is a little story about my nieces and nephews.
[241:05.33]I went to Disney one time.
[241:07.58]And Disney had the, oh, they make those little drinks.
[241:10.40]And it was like Star Wars land.
[241:11.83]And in there, there's like these cubes and the ice cubes and they light up.
[241:15.77]They were kind of like made to be put into the drink to make like, oh, look, it's a green drink and it's lit up green.
[241:21.38]But the ice cube was just like a refreezable thing, whatever the hell it was.
[241:25.31]So anyways, I was like, wow, look at that, isn't that kind of cool?
[241:30.00]And I took it out and it was glowing and it was like blue and then red.
[241:34.05]And all of the nieces and nephews wanted this.
[241:38.91]They were like, what is that magical cube?
[241:41.36]It's just elixir.
[241:43.50]It looks incredible.
[241:44.90]I see that.
[241:45.24]I had this little cube and they wanted it so bad and eventually it started a fight.
[241:52.03]It started a problem.
[241:54.22]Because I gave it to one, like, oh, you can play with the magical cube of light for a few minutes.
[241:59.65]And then another kid was like, I want to play with the magical cube of light.
[242:04.71]And I was like, well, hold on a second.
[242:06.53]And then all of a sudden you hear from the, I was facing the other direction.
[242:10.28]We were in a car.
[242:11.88]And I hear, I want the magical cube of light all to myself.
[242:17.59]Like a super villain.
[242:19.70]Right.
[242:20.78]Allegiances were made over this cube.
[242:22.44]It sounds like a plot to an Avengers movie or something.
[242:26.33]It was.
[242:26.57]It was like the Tesseract.
[242:28.33]Yeah, exactly.
[242:29.14]I get it.
[242:30.40]It's hard to learn sharing.
[242:33.30]I mean, I still struggle with that sometimes.
[242:35.85]And that was just a fake ice cube.
[242:38.73]It was a toy.
[242:41.84]Right.
[242:45.12]That is so funny.
[242:46.99]Yeah, I mean, if a toy is shiny enough and does enough things, people would straight up kill for these toys.
[242:52.62]I get it.
[242:53.06]Even Furbies.
[242:54.62]I wanted a Furby so bad.
[242:55.88]I would have just killed for one.
[243:00.01]How do I get out of this?
[243:01.01]I don't think you can.
[243:06.72]I'm going to fight you like a Dark Souls enemy, okay?
[243:09.20]Okay.
[243:13.55]Wait, I'm so good.
[243:16.71]Wait, holy shit.
[243:17.53]That was perfect.
[243:18.48]But I think it's because I gave it a name.
[243:20.96]I named it.
[243:22.22]So before it was an ice cube, but when I named it the magical cube of light.
[243:27.89]That was a mistake.
[243:30.17]Yeah, it's too tempting.
[243:32.23]I get it.
[243:33.03]It's not just some lame cube.
[243:35.90]Yeah, and I guess I did take it out a few times before we got to the car and I was like, oh, I'm just holding on to the magical cube of light.
[243:44.16]they have to be chill about it like give me a break they're gonna be oh okay it's just the magical cube of light I don't care I may have been part of the problem that's true there we go now I want one I want this magical cube yeah I should have endowed it somebody said
[244:04.63]Speaking of nephews, I had to talk to my nephew because when he would talk to an elder in our family, he'd be like, Nani, I'm chill, not going to lie.
[244:15.02]And I'd have to be like, listen, you can't talk to our elders like that.
[244:21.41]I'm chill.
[244:23.35]I'm just chilling out, not going to lie, for real.
[244:26.05]He talks like that.
[244:27.47]For real at the end?
[244:29.52]Well, I just like using like young TikTok slang.
[244:34.49]How old is he?
[244:36.57]Oh, he's really young.
[244:37.59]I think this was like a while.
[244:39.17]This is a while ago now.
[244:41.09]He must have been like 11.
[244:46.04]But that's how the kids talk.
[244:47.30]Like, what are you supposed to do?
[244:48.18]It's not his fault.
[244:48.99]But his parents are like, that's so disrespectful.
[244:53.41]Hey, look, even Bebop and Rocksteady are cheering us on.
[244:56.89]Wait, that's so sweet.
[244:57.99]Oh my god, and we're in Egypt.
[245:00.83]Wait, who's behind me?
[245:01.81]Who's this?
[245:03.10]I think that's just a random putty.
[245:06.28]Okay.
[245:07.62]This character seems kind of insane.
[245:08.60]Oh, like that's a default.
[245:09.94]Look at the reach I have on this.
[245:11.40]That's not fair.
[245:13.58]Yeah, it's actually crazy.
[245:16.11]But it's slow.
[245:22.35]Why did I just do that?
[245:25.29]What are you even saying?
[245:27.06]Get moving!
[245:27.92]Get moving!
[245:30.31]It sounds like he's going, Jamboree!
[245:32.17]Jamboree!
[245:33.87]I don't know how to do it consistently, though.
[245:39.90]Oh, my God.
[245:40.88]What?
[245:42.77]Oh, out of time.
[245:46.61]I feel like in that, oh, you knew.
[245:48.58]Somebody called me.
[245:49.94]I feel like you.
[245:51.16]Oh, oop.
[245:53.76]Somebody said Spider-Man back there.
[245:56.90]my god imagine off-brand Spider-Man dude do you think that uh Spider-Man could beat rafael in a 1v1 no no way absolutely I think I think I think Spider-Man wins yeah I don't think it was going to even be close they get this web sling the weapons out I I actually think rafael might beat him beat Spider-Man yeah okay explain how would the fight go
[246:24.67]Because Peter Parker would be like, well, I'm not sitting... And then he'd already have the skewer through.
[246:31.64]Right.
[246:32.55]You would have a bunch of Marvel comments.
[246:34.77]He'd be like, oh, Raphael's right behind me, isn't he?
[246:37.35]And then he just dies.
[246:39.02]I think he would talk for the first 10 to 20 seconds, and Raphael's kind of a hothead, and I think he would just fly at him and just be like... What about the spider sense?
[246:54.02]Oh, true.
[246:55.18]Wait, that's a good point.
[246:56.47]Mods, give that chatter a million dollars.
[246:59.11]That's such a good point.
[246:59.83]I think in hand-to-hand combat, I think Raphael wins every time.
[247:04.42]Oh, like, okay, wait, hold on.
[247:06.05]Of course.
[247:06.99]Like, can Spider-Man use, like, webs?
[247:10.44]he can use whatever he wants but we're talking about the gap is like this it is no longer he's on like flying around grabbing on a building and suction cupping onto a building they are right here this close to each other I think rafael gets the out of him I think you're wrong I don't know Spider-Man's good it's good like he's not he's not like a web one trick
[247:34.05]he's not he doesn't have like a gimmick like raphael's just a strong turtle you know what I mean Spider-Man he's got superpowers and he's like you know he's got insane strength yeah but that scene with toby mcguire where he fights that like uh that high school kid who's like bullying him and that kid was like way bigger I think that's how the fight goes
[248:00.36]Super strength.
[248:01.62]Yeah, but didn't the, what about the ooze?
[248:04.10]The ooze is, the turtles are super powered.
[248:06.16]They're not just like big turtles that are swimming around in the ocean.
[248:09.43]They're ooze, like alien ooze powered super humans.
[248:14.41]Yeah, but that's, that's, that's my specialty.
[248:17.36]Uncle Ben always says, like, do you not see it playing out in your head?
[248:21.08]Yeah, but.
[248:22.52]Oh, this stuff's radioactive.
[248:24.34]You could be just doing an impression of Leonardo right now.
[248:29.06]Replace everything you were going to say, but say like, let's go turtles at the end.
[248:33.79]You're right.
[248:34.61]Spiders are my specialty.
[248:37.03]Let's go turtles.
[248:38.24]Wait, you're right.
[248:38.88]That's Leonardo.
[248:41.06]Oh my God.
[248:41.84]Leonardo and Spider-Man are like the same character.
[248:46.45]I feel like all comic book superheroes or fighters are all the same character.
[248:52.56]And so is Sonic the Hedgehog.
[248:55.69]Sonic's the name.
[248:56.83]Speed's the game.
[248:57.77]I'm just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
[248:59.85]You're too slow.
[249:01.30]Raph, calm down.
[249:07.50]You're right.
[249:07.86]You just ruined so many series all at once during my thing.
[249:12.79]That's awesome.
[249:14.83]Oh, wow.
[249:16.73]The Ninja Turtles in this game are OP.
[249:19.52]They are actually really good.
[249:21.08]They're so good.
[249:24.55]Yeah, but how can you explain this?
[249:25.83]Ready?
[249:26.31]So you said that there's no superpowers involved.
[249:29.41]What about this?
[249:30.48]How do you explain Jamboree?
[249:37.11]Wait, wait, wait.
[249:38.99]The Raphael Jamboree move where he throws the fire.
[249:41.93]Yeah.
[249:42.90]I mean, I don't know if that's a superpower.
[249:44.76]Now we have to, what's the superpower definition to you?
[249:49.79]I think superpower is... I think that's just supernatural, right?
[249:52.57]Yeah, you're right.
[249:54.12]You are more powerful than a human.
[249:56.58]Well, than all animals would be.
[249:58.14]Hold on.
[250:00.37]I think a superpower has to be superhuman.
[250:02.69]Like, it has to be like... It has to be like a normal human being can't do it.
[250:07.17]So I guess, yeah, you're right.
[250:08.10]That is a superpower.
[250:09.56]So is a cheetah a superhero?
[250:16.20]You're taking a long time to answer this one.
[250:21.65]Yes, yes, a cheetah is a superhero.
[250:29.02]Like, is a great white shark a superhero?
[250:32.93]Yes, yes.
[250:34.93]A super villain.
[250:36.10]No, they're important for the ecosystem.
[250:37.58]I'll say a hero.
[250:40.70]I'm sorry, dude.
[250:41.78]If you were to put... Alright, who wins in a fight?
[250:45.41]A killer whale or Spider-Man?
[250:50.52]Spider-Man.
[250:51.16]I think the killer whale just fucking murders him.
[250:53.00]I think he just dies.
[250:54.68]Spider-Man's smarter than the killer whale.
[250:56.49]There's no way.
[251:00.95]Like, just take him out of the water.
[251:02.33]Hold on a second.
[251:03.06]He'll just rub him out of the water and just be, like, dangling in front of the frickin', you know, Brooklyn Bridge.
[251:09.06]Put a fuckin' cape on that killer whale and a letter on his chest.
[251:12.49]Do you still believe that?
[251:14.11]Oh, then the killer whale wins.
[251:17.28]No, you got me there.
[251:18.30]Then the killer whale for sure is gonna win that one, of course.
[251:22.78]Put, like, a big W on his chest and have a big, long, blue cape on him.
[251:26.75]Do you still think that he would be, that Spider-Man wins?
[251:29.83]no not even a little chance wait isn't there like a way there's a shark superhero I remember because he was in suicide squad what's that guy's name yeah who is that guy can I amend my superhero this guy right here yeah oh my god armageddon
[251:50.28]this guy would kick the shit out of Spider-Man.
[251:52.20]Spider-Man loses to this guy.
[251:54.24]Okay.
[251:54.78]Okay.
[251:55.64]Let me amend my definition.
[251:58.07]A superhero is someone who's like a human, but has sub has like superhuman ability, but it has to be a human.
[252:08.56]Okay.
[252:08.86]So it has to be a human being, a superhuman.
[252:11.56]Yes.
[252:12.58]Is Thanos a human?
[252:17.43]Yeah.
[252:18.37]Thanos is a human being.
[252:20.26]Is Thanos a homosapien?
[252:21.99]He has human traits.
[252:27.60]Thanos is an alien.
[252:28.54]Yeah, but is it a humanoid or is it a human being?
[252:32.58]A humanoid.
[252:33.54]Humanoid, okay.
[252:35.25]Yeah, that counts.
[252:35.77]I got bit by a fucking bug.
[252:36.87]What the hell happened to me?
[252:39.51]Oh my god.
[252:39.99]What?
[252:40.95]Ow.
[252:42.40]Dude, do you think that's what came into... Did that come into your laboo-boo box or something?
[252:45.96]A hidden bug?
[252:49.54]I'm so glad I got those socks.
[252:51.10]It's so crazy.
[252:52.79]Socks are cool.
[252:57.27]Oh, if you hit AX, it's a rare move.
[253:01.68]Is this a counter?
[253:03.68]Wait.
[253:03.80]How did I just do that move?
[253:07.91]Are you doing aura?
[253:10.85]Aura.
[253:12.91]I'm aura farming.
[253:13.67]I want to do that move again.
[253:15.17]What does it even do?
[253:23.11]Oh, careful.
[253:29.21]How did I take damage?
[253:31.32]Did you hear that, like, ring?
[253:32.38]I wonder what that's about.
[253:33.56]Yeah.
[253:34.46]What was that?
[253:34.96]Was it extra life?
[253:37.02]I have no clue.
[253:38.90]Oh, my God.
[253:42.11]My eyes.
[253:42.51]Don't forget to blink.
[253:44.39]Oh, shit.
[253:44.85]You're right.
[253:47.13]My monitor brightness is so low.
[253:49.99]that I'll be playing a game that's like really dark and everyone's just like question marking me.
[253:54.54]They're like, how do you not see the thing right in front of you?
[253:57.88]So I need games with the subtlety of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighters because I can't miss anything no matter how low my brightness is.
[254:06.53]Otherwise I'm crying on stream.
[254:08.64]My eyes are so sensitive.
[254:11.34]I can't deal with it.
[254:12.00]My eyes have gotten way more sensitive in recent years.
[254:14.96]Yeah, but do you think that's because of your computer use?
[254:16.77]That's what my eye doctor said, but I don't know.
[254:18.81]I imagine probably something to do with it.
[254:21.73]Yeah, like, it just, like, degrades your... the eye moisture.
[254:24.69]So I'm using, like... I'm, like, spamming eyedrops.
[254:29.32]I've actually been using eyedrops recently, too.
[254:31.98]Me, too.
[254:32.44]I've got, like, a little collection on my desk.
[254:35.53]One's with contact, one that's a little chilled.
[254:38.13]Yeah, I don't know.
[254:40.65]That's not a good news for my eyes.
[254:43.97]uh wingnut fine we'll do a mirror oh yeah let's do it whoever loses this has to send the other person jigsaw socks um okay I don't know what I don't know how to do that
[255:17.91]Here's a comeback.
[255:19.67]Oh, it's a best of three, by the way.
[255:21.57]Okay.
[255:23.62]Don't say okay.
[255:24.90]You're so confident you're going to win.
[255:27.12]I mean, I am.
[255:29.21]Yeah, I know.
[255:30.75]But still, you don't know.
[255:31.95]I may have a secret move.
[255:34.90]Let's see the secret move.
[255:36.76]Alright, here we go.
[255:38.28]What happened to the dog cookie?
[255:40.74]I ate it.
[255:42.69]Dude, I went... It was so fucking gross.
[255:46.71]It tasted like... It tasted like... Dude, that's definitely going to be a freaking YouTube short because that reaction was so freaking sweet.
[255:56.23]Let me tell you, you guys are going to want to go back in the VOD and see Jerma eating a dog cookie.
[256:00.94]It was actually... And then we're going to do a ghost pepper challenge.
[256:04.72]If you're just joining the stream, Jerma and I are going to do a ghost pepper challenge coming up soon.
[256:10.53]You're not going to want to miss it.
[256:12.72]Yeah, I would say you probably don't want to miss that one.
[256:14.94]No, that's definitely going to be a must watch.
[256:17.48]So instead of us playing the Switch for our Switch Sundays, it's going to be ghost pepper Sundays.
[256:24.57]We could think of another...
[256:26.94]Like, oh, this is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Tuesday.
[256:29.27]And now Ghost Pepper every Sunday.
[256:32.83]Yeah, imagine running out of content ideas that fast.
[256:35.42]We've played together, well, Switch or whatever, just playing a game.
[256:39.04]Like three times or four times.
[256:41.20]We're already completely out of things to play and ideas.
[256:43.65]So might as well just eat Ghost Peppers now.
[256:46.23]Ghost Pepper Among Us Challenge, episode one.
[256:50.76]That sounds pretty good.
[256:51.66]Oops.
[256:56.80]Wait, by the way, dog food or no, no jigsaw socks on the line.
[257:03.59]OK, never mind.
[257:12.24]Oh.
[257:22.70]Oh, dude, you're gonna get a pair of jigsaw socks.
[257:29.25]Let's freaking go.
[257:30.99]No way, you're gonna get these ones.
[257:33.59]Glow-in-the-dark jigsaw socks.
[257:36.06]What?
[257:38.12]That's crazy.
[257:39.30]You gotta send them over.
[257:43.53]What does this say?
[257:44.31]Has its pieces?
[257:47.33]What?
[257:48.37]On the sock?
[257:49.39]I gotta tell you that these socks are cool, right?
[257:51.76]This is great.
[257:54.98]Do you really have to put this here?
[257:56.48]Like, they're so concerned about their brand and their trademark.
[258:00.09]I can't- Jerma, I can't see the sock.
[258:02.35]Are you gesturing it into the camera?
[258:03.67]Like, it's like a gigantic copyright logo.
[258:06.42]I feel like you have to have that right there.
[258:08.16]Oh, on the bottom of it?
[258:10.40]Yeah, that's- that's crazy.
[258:11.99]In the- in one of the biggest fonts.
[258:13.89]Trademark at 2025 Lionsgate Entertainment Incorporated.
[258:16.45]All related companies.
[258:17.45]All rights reserved.
[258:18.88]Like, these are fun socks.
[258:19.84]You're gonna- don't get me with the copyright shit.
[258:22.47]Watch that part, glow-in-the-dark 2.
[258:24.25]Just the disclosures.
[258:28.06]Just for legal reasons.
[258:29.08]If something's gonna glow, it's gotta be us, you know, saving our ass.
[258:32.22]Put that on, put that on the, like, on the heel or something.
[258:34.79]Put that on, like, the box.
[258:37.69]No, no, it's gotta be prominently displayed.
[258:39.33]They don't want to get into legal trouble.
[258:41.49]You don't know how ruthless these sock lawsuits go.
[258:44.28]At least it's on the bottom.
[258:46.04]Yeah, but if it's a collector's item, I don't... Have it on a tag.
[258:50.69]Why can't it be on a tag?
[258:52.30]That's right, exactly.
[258:53.29]Yeah, no, I'm with you.
[258:59.86]We both ended up as Ninja Turtles.
[259:02.10]Yeah, just go fist to fist.
[259:05.10]Oh, shit.
[259:09.57]That does so much damage.
[259:11.23]Oh my god, it really does.
[259:12.14]For a ranged attack.
[259:24.79]It's so cringe.
[259:26.95]Alright, if I lose this I'm swallowing this the sock No freaking way Oh Wait, we never reviewed the last game you have to give it out of ten I
[259:52.30]Like, which one did you like more?
[259:54.38]The last game or the one before?
[259:55.70]It was great.
[259:56.44]I would say that.
[259:57.02]I'd say Turtles in Time is one of my favorite games ever.
[259:59.58]Yeah.
[260:01.89]Dude, that last game was so hard.
[260:04.77]Those last few levels were brutal.
[260:11.46]Yes.
[260:13.90]I'm kind of spamming.
[260:19.09]Alright, I'll take that.
[260:22.10]Are there any other, like, must plays on this collection?
[260:25.62]Did you swallow it, by the way?
[260:27.44]I'm good.
[260:35.09]I'm fine.
[260:36.39]Oh, hold on.
[260:40.66]I'm fine.
[260:42.90]Yeah, I believe you.
[260:49.53]Somebody called me Vet Trip Andy.
[260:54.83]Vet Trip Andy.
[261:01.14]I hate this light up here.
[261:04.57]Yo, you can't... Are you talking about in your room?
[261:06.73]You can't have top lighting, Jeremiah.
[261:08.81]I know.
[261:09.60]I fucking hate it.
[261:11.28]You gotta have cozy lighting.
[261:12.60]What else is on this?
[261:13.26]Okay, well, there's other things on this collection, but... Let's do one more of these and maybe we'll call it for... Yeah, we'll call it for today.
[261:20.97]Yeah, last one.
[261:21.85]Final one.
[261:22.66]On Sky Palace.
[261:24.21]And whoever loses this one has to swallow this.
[261:29.16]What?
[261:29.44]What are you gesturing at?
[261:37.35]Oh no, I wish I chose my main.
[261:42.32]Alright, Donatello's gonna fucking crack.
[261:51.84]I feel like you're just I haven't gotten a single opportunity to hit you you're gonna have to you're gonna just follow this oh no what is it I'm scared it is who is it what's their name spooky wives tales is that a name of a guy in despicable me I don't I I thought their names were like Kevin
[262:21.57]also I've never seen despicable me four I didn't know they made a fourth one must have been straight to DVD or something the guys who made despicable me also made the Mario movie did you know that uh illumination yeah did you like the Mario movie did you think it was good no no I wanted to so bad I mean it was about as good as I like it was fine I thought it was like I liked all the references like it was fun
[262:49.28]I wouldn't watch it again.
[262:50.80]Yeah, I would have appreciated less, like, licensed movie tracks and more Rainbow Road.
[262:56.17]That's exactly my complaint, too.
[262:58.89]Do we really need... Like, they played Highway to the Danger.
[263:03.18]We built this city on... No, I want... Why did they play that?
[263:10.57]Like, why... Do you think, like... I bet you, like, Nintendo's lawyers are probably like, nah, like, there's only a limit for our movie.
[263:16.28]We don't want to overload.
[263:17.68]I don't know.
[263:18.80]Yeah, I agree.
[263:19.45]I was like, so why are they playing these songs?
[263:21.69]They got all of the good freaking hits.
[263:28.34]Alright.
[263:28.76]I wish that had more Mario music.
[263:33.03]I agree.
[263:33.77]But what can you do?
[263:34.61]Apparently, they're making a Zelda movie soon.
[263:36.71]Isn't that live action?
[263:39.22]Yes.
[263:41.22]I wish it was cartoon, but they would never...
[263:43.60]I wonder how they're going to pull that off.
[263:45.06]I feel like every live action video game movie is doomed to be a like 12% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[263:52.21]Yeah.
[263:53.31]Has there ever been one that's been good?
[263:55.94]Scooby Doo.
[263:57.58]Video game.
[263:59.22]Scooby Doo live action.
[264:01.08]Well, Scooby Doo wasn't a video game first.
[264:04.07]Oh, you're right.
[264:06.77]That's why you just said video game.
[264:08.41]You don't have just a random outburst.
[264:12.36]he just said video game is it Borderlands time that person off for an hour uh sonic uh okay alright that's true that was pretty good it was good movies were amazing I loved the sonic movie the one with keanu reeves is crazy the first one was the best though okay yeah that's for fallout oh that's another one was followed uh people liked it you're right yeah oh you should watch fallout oh and uh Resident Evil I'm just like I'm just trying to think of everything
[264:41.89]All the Resident Evil movies are considered some of the worst movies of all time.
[264:45.61]I liked them.
[264:47.91]Do you really?
[264:49.00]I used to watch them.
[264:49.88]Yeah, I really liked the Resident Evil movies.
[264:51.66]Okay, the reason why I hated them, I always hated them, is because when I was younger, I wanted to see a movie version of the game, right?
[265:02.85]Oh, Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 2.
[265:04.83]Let's go to Raccoon City.
[265:05.87]We're going to go into the mansion.
[265:07.66]When I first saw it, I was so excited.
[265:09.56]It's like, oh, here we go.
[265:11.79]Who the fuck are all these people?
[265:14.27]Who are all these original characters they made up for this?
[265:17.20]What is this?
[265:17.82]Where is everybody?
[265:19.42]It's just a zombie movie.
[265:20.82]It's just like, how is this Resident Evil?
[265:22.99]And I was so flabbergasted by this.
[265:26.35]I hated every second of it.
[265:28.14]I couldn't get into it.
[265:28.74]To take devil's advocate here, I think one of the biggest mistakes is to recreate the video game.
[265:35.47]Like, because you'll never, it'll never reach, like there's not, it'll never be able to capture the essence of a video game.
[265:41.27]Like, I think you have to make original characters or like completely rewrite the video game characters.
[265:46.22]I think you can, I think you can just make it so over the top and cheesy on purpose.
[265:51.88]Like you could do it if you just keep it the same cheese ball.
[265:55.05]But I don't know, people are afraid to make cheese ball shit now.
[265:58.31]Everything has to have some fucking, like, it's gotta be very specific.
[266:03.36]It's gotta be a certain way.
[266:04.66]It has to be, everybody has a certain target audience for this.
[266:07.59]They're not gonna like that.
[266:08.41]If you do, like, the cheeseball shit, they're gonna hate it.
[266:10.81]What the fuck?
[266:11.47]Where's all the cheeseball?
[266:13.20]It feels like all these movies are made by a boardroom.
[266:15.80]Like, there's no, like...
[266:17.13]one person's voice being portrayed anymore and it's like also dark like even like I love Christopher nolan just Batman but man did that start just a series of like brooding superheroes right I want like a fun like a silly tonic tongue-in-cheek superman or something yeah we just haven't gotten that I we kind of like you said everything has to be
[266:39.86]We gotta have, like, a million marketers, like, tell us exactly how we're gonna do this.
[266:43.65]And we have to be, it's gotta be, it has to be, like, a crazy, we have to, in that movie, we need to know about Superman's past.
[266:50.17]And he has to cry in the movie.
[266:53.60]Yeah, exactly.
[266:53.90]And crying in three, in about, act three, at about one hour in, there has to be a sentimental moment.
[267:00.19]That'll play very well.
[267:02.05]Like, it's just so... Was the, okay, so, was the last Superman movie, I haven't seen it.
[267:06.48]Was it this?
[267:07.14]Was it good?
[267:08.38]I haven't seen it either.
[267:10.29]It just happened.
[267:12.35]Dude, let's go.
[267:13.73]You want to go see the Superman movie?
[267:15.46]Let's go.
[267:15.84]Let's go.
[267:17.62]Let's go.
[267:19.00]Like right now.
[267:21.73]Is it actually like that?
[267:22.77]It just happened.
[267:23.55]Oh yeah.
[267:24.37]Let's go.
[267:24.75]Thank God.
[267:26.88]Wait, perfect.
[267:28.64]Apparently the Superman movie, somebody said is like, is like arcadey and funny and weird.
[267:32.24]That's awesome.
[267:33.14]That's the way it should be.
[267:34.64]Like, I don't want... Like, even the Man of Steel or whatever was so serious.
[267:38.49]I was like, yeah, at the end of the day, like, you see a superhero walking around with a cape, and you see them, like, go into a place where there's regular civilians.
[267:46.18]They just look so silly.
[267:47.98]Like, I don't know.
[267:48.48]It's just so strange.
[267:49.50]I guess, like, the Marvel movies were very, like, telling jokes, and... Oh, I... What do you say about that?
[267:55.55]Oh, what do you say, Loki?
[267:57.23]Loki!
[267:58.21]Loki!
[267:58.90]Oh, I don't know about that, Loki.
[268:00.74]Okay, well...
[268:01.37]right but that's a really good question but I feel like I don't I it didn't like kind of gel with me very well I don't know why it felt like a little
[268:11.53]I just felt like it was like jokes not like a funny character there's like a stand comedian it was it's too ironic it's not playing it earnestly like there's a certain cynical like I watch a Marvel movie like I'm gonna like Deadpool and Deadpool seems so cynical to me because it's like the whole time I expect Deadpool to look into the camera and be like oh a movie huh
[268:35.84]Like, it's not playing earnest comedy.
[268:37.93]Like, it's not... It's, like, the whole thing is that it's a bit.
[268:41.37]But it's not, like... It's the... The joke isn't the character itself.
[268:45.02]The joke is the fact that they're making a joke.
[268:47.28]Yeah.
[268:47.64]I think Deadpool gets a small pass for me just because that Deadpool, the character, has always been like, Hey, you reading the comic right now?
[268:55.33]Hey!
[268:55.93]Like, I want you to turn to page seven!
[268:57.60]Like, he's always kind of been like that, but...
[269:00.19]No, I mean, I didn't hate the movie.
[269:01.99]I just thought that that's the vibe that I get from not just Deadpool, but from Marvel movies.
[269:07.88]It's like you make so many of them that you have to eventually go like, oh, this is the big battle part, right?
[269:13.61]I kind of felt that with the Star Wars movie, the new Star Wars movies, too.
[269:17.23]It just felt like everybody had to have a, I'm going to say something to you, and then I'm going to say something back.
[269:22.28]And then, well, I'm going to say something a little bit witty at the end of that.
[269:25.10]And then almost like you said, you're expecting Jim to look into the camera at the office.
[269:31.34]No, you're so right.
[269:32.46]And then they remade the Star Wars movies and they just couldn't, they didn't understand what made the original special.
[269:37.95]So it just became this mess of irony, in my opinion.
[269:41.69]Yeah, it's just like every, almost every scene had to have an ironic last sentence of the dialog.
[269:48.80]They fly now?
[269:49.60]Or like, they're like, oh, stormtroopers have bad aim.
[269:55.29]Right, guys?
[269:57.81]Eyebrow raised smirk.
[269:59.74]Yeah.
[270:00.81]Yeah.
[270:01.43]And it comes off to me as like very cynical for some reason.
[270:04.75]Yeah.
[270:05.01]Banter, like banter.
[270:06.45]Everything has to be banter.
[270:08.57]If George Lucas was around now pitching Star Wars to a studio and he's like, alright, there's going to be this like dog humanoid called Chewbacca.
[270:17.64]Like, does it speak English?
[270:18.56]He goes like, I would shoot him down.
[270:20.81]Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[270:22.17]That doesn't fit into the cinematic universe.
[270:25.29]You made like a little sound.
[270:27.25]Did you do that a little louder?
[270:28.21]I didn't hear it.
[270:31.89]That was kind of cowardly lion.
[270:37.24]That's still cowardly lion.
[270:38.52]Actually, how do you do Chewbacca without being a cowardly lion?
[270:49.11]Hold on.
[270:49.38]I'll try.
[270:49.72]Okay.
[270:53.92]Let me get it down here first.
[270:56.14]Okay.
[270:56.26]Better warm up.
[271:01.17]I can't do it.
[271:02.54]You sound like a lion like trapped in a cage.
[271:08.12]Someone help this lion.
[271:10.01]He's seriously injured.
[271:11.29]Seriously, call for help.
[271:25.43]He's now in water.
[271:26.35]He's drowning.
[271:27.13]He's drowning now.
[271:34.45]I gotta fucking get it together.
[271:35.57]My acting has to be better for this ghost pepper stream.
[271:39.43]What do you mean acting?
[271:40.19]We're gonna have a real ghost pepper.
[271:42.16]This sentence is a parody.
[271:43.68]Oh, yeah.
[271:44.34]Yeah, this is really gonna burn, I guess.
[271:47.62]Dude, that's right.
[271:48.18]When we both eat a real ghost pepper on camera, this is a parody sentence that I said.
[271:55.75]It'll be no acting.
[271:58.82]Now we're gonna have the disclosures on the bottom of our socks of the stream, basically.
[272:05.23]All statements made during the stream may or may not be legally binding.
[272:08.71]Copyrighted, Hasbro.
[272:12.62]Erm, this is gonna hurt.
[272:17.42]Oh god.
[272:17.58]That sucked so bad I had to mute my audio.
[272:18.88]Oh, I guess another stream challenge today.
[272:20.77]Hey, that person just subscribed for 40 months and they said that I sucked.
[272:29.06]That's a long time to sub to somebody that you think sucks.
[272:32.44]Yeah.
[272:35.18]40 months, too.
[272:39.18]Oh, no.
[272:42.03]Okay, your character with range is insane.
[272:46.03]Oh!
[272:46.99]I don't know.
[272:47.35]How am I supposed to hit you?
[272:48.59]Oh, I know.
[272:51.54]We have our own special moves here, don't we?
[273:00.43]Like, I don't know what to do there.
[273:05.91]Oh, that wasn't a kill.
[273:12.64]No!
[273:13.44]No fair.
[273:13.84]You put water on the end of your baton and it shorted me out.
[273:19.81]Why is there a dog here?
[273:22.47]Why not?
[273:22.89]It's a bar.
[273:23.55]It's like Austin, Texas bar.
[273:25.32]Dogs are everywhere.
[273:27.78]I'm going to say something perhaps the most controversial thing I've ever said on stream.
[273:32.93]Dogs should not be in grocery stores.
[273:35.17]I agree.
[273:36.13]That's not- dude, I would've just high-fived you.
[273:39.64]It's brave to say, because everyone's like, dogs should be everywhere.
[273:42.16]I don't like that.
[273:44.97]Yeah, and they, like, walk around, they just- And they- oh, oh, is that my cereal?
[273:49.49]They lift their leg up and they piss.
[273:51.17]Like, they pee onto the fuckin' Cheerios.
[273:54.94]No, hold on.
[273:56.48]Now you've lost me here.
[273:58.12]Okay, I don't know, what?
[273:59.49]Oh, am I gonna buy that?
[274:00.51]Am I gonna buy that ground beef?
[274:01.79]I just saw a dog walk over it and lift its leg up and piss into the ground beef.
[274:05.63]Now, I don't know what dogs you're going to, what grocery stores you got.
[274:09.70]Now, I'm completely off this.
[274:11.32]I'm on the dog side now because I feel like you're generalizing these dogs.
[274:15.36]The dogs are a little better behaved than that.
[274:17.35]Can you imagine seeing that?
[274:20.21]Can you imagine seeing like a dog?
[274:22.37]I would be like, what do I do?
[274:23.52]I have to like fucking tell somebody.
[274:25.86]Yeah, 100%.
[274:28.24]Dude, you know what I saw?
[274:29.36]This is really gross.
[274:30.39]I saw a dog pee in an apartment hallway.
[274:35.27]And the owner just let it happen and didn't think anyone was watching.
[274:38.54]I was watching.
[274:41.63]I was there.
[274:42.21]I saw it.
[274:42.59]What did you do?
[274:43.39]Did you go, oh, fuck, now it's on me to figure out what I'm going to do about this?
[274:48.20]No, I just thought, ugh, and then I just went on with my day.
[274:54.50]I'm not going to take initiative, of course.
[274:57.50]Oh, God.
[274:59.39]Jesus.
[275:01.09]And then I just went on.
[275:02.61]Oh, brother.
[275:04.27]Oh, boy.
[275:05.03]Oh, golly.
[275:07.31]Like, what are you supposed to do?
[275:09.00]Like, do I walk up to the owner and say, hey, I saw you.
[275:12.06]Oh, by the way, sorry, dog.
[275:13.80]Piss on my door.
[275:16.50]Yeah.
[275:16.62]What are you going to realistically do?
[275:18.11]I'm not a very confrontational guy.
[275:20.22]Yeah, you know what?
[275:21.32]Here's the thing that sucks about the humanity.
[275:23.94]This is the worst thing about, this is what's awful about everything, right?
[275:28.58]Okay.
[275:28.70]Like, if you, let's, okay, let's just say that that happened, right?
[275:32.13]And this is somebody that lives, I'm assuming, in the building.
[275:34.91]Yes.
[275:35.41]They live in the building, and do they live probably right near you?
[275:38.33]Yes.
[275:39.61]The worst part about confrontation, the worst part about, like, having to confront that, is if you go up to that person and go, hey, um, the fuck are you doing?
[275:47.62]Your dog just, like, pissed over there.
[275:48.86]What the fuck's wrong with you?
[275:51.10]That, you are now, you have an enemy now.
[275:53.06]That person's now, like, you now have to have that confrontation.
[275:56.43]You have a negative energy with that person now, forever.
[276:01.59]Yeah, yeah.
[276:01.83]I completely agree.
[276:02.59]And it's just like, ah, I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole, but now if I go up to you and tell you you're an asshole, I'm the guy that came up to you and called you an asshole.
[276:10.48]So now, you and I, when we interact ever again, I'm the guy that you knew that you had your dog piss all down the hall for me.
[276:19.16]Oh, time went out.
[276:19.74]Did I win?
[276:22.05]No.
[276:23.41]I think not.
[276:24.93]Close enough.
[276:26.55]No, I agree.
[276:27.37]But I have kind of an awkward situation happening with my neighbors.
[276:30.92]I have to make my voice low because they might be hearing me.
[276:33.84]I was going to say, be careful here.
[276:36.08]I had a next door neighbor who complained that they were hearing unsavory things from my apartment.
[276:44.59]That's what they said to me.
[276:45.95]Not a sound complaint.
[276:46.55]Because you're streaming?
[276:48.09]Yeah.
[276:49.59]And this is when, you know what time it was?
[276:51.01]5 p.m.
[276:53.35]unsavory they knocked they came they came to my door knocked on my door and said I hear unsavory conversations this is why I don't even this is why I don't want to watch horror movies either like dude anything
[277:08.03]unsavory to me is you must have been like screaming at something like in a game like oh no I was don't kill me I didn't even say anything unsavory you're playing city skylines I was playing city skylines I think I said like what the fuck
[277:26.14]Okay, so if you weren't screaming, but that's awkward because yeah now you have in your brain and they have in their brain That's the that is the group of people or person that now when you don't you come out Oh there.
[277:39.98]I'm coming down.
[277:40.42]We're going down my apartment.
[277:41.71]Oh, there's Larry.
[277:43.13]Oh, hey, Larry Oh, yeah, I like hate you.
[277:45.51]You hate me too.
[277:46.97]We both fucking hate each other Is that bad
[277:52.33]It's so awkward.
[277:53.49]But, like, we're on, like, okay terms.
[277:55.74]Like, I'll go into the, you know, I'll run into him.
[277:57.92]And I'm just like, hey, bud.
[277:58.92]Like, is everything alright?
[278:00.60]Like, I'm trying to keep it down.
[278:04.05]I don't know what to say.
[278:04.99]I bring it up.
[278:06.54]Yeah.
[278:07.38]It's awkward.
[278:07.80]It is.
[278:08.10]Because.
[278:09.52]Whenever you are the one that that starts the kind of conversation against something like that like if a dog shit in my lawn But shit in my lawn.
[278:18.07]It's like ah This the amount of energy that it takes to like deal with that is like But that person should have some repercussions of that right you should be called out for that but like I don't want to interact with you in a negative way because now with all things fucked forever and
[278:34.70]No, you're right.
[278:35.44]You're right.
[278:35.86]You just like the smart thing to do is to not do anything and just deal with it yourself.
[278:41.85]Yeah.
[278:41.97]That's the sad reality.
[278:43.42]On that same front, how do you feel about watching a scary movie now?
[278:46.48]I feel like I can't watch scary movies.
[278:48.14]I just don't want to.
[278:49.75]No, I can't.
[278:51.11]It affects me too much.
[278:52.51]Well, I'm just talking about other people.
[278:54.39]Exactly kind of what you were describing.
[278:55.49]I was like, oh, we heard stuff.
[278:56.89]I had a scary movie on like a few weeks, I want to say a couple months ago.
[279:01.98]And every time there would be like a, no, please don't kill me.
[279:08.71]I'm like, turn the volume down because people are going to imagine just walking around.
[279:12.53]You hear one of your neighbors and you hear in the like, no, it's killing me.
[279:17.86]It's like, I don't fucking want that to be blasted out to my neighbor.
[279:20.50]Like, what if you think I'm killing somebody?
[279:23.08]Do your neighbors think you kill people?
[279:25.22]I think that's so... No, but it's just like... You would think, no way, that's...
[279:28.90]All I'm saying is if there is, if you watch like some people have like surround sound with like triple bass and it's like horror movies of people screaming like being killed.
[279:41.46]And you hear let's play a game.
[279:42.69]You're not going to assume someone's being tortured in there, right?
[279:46.45]You're not going to hear that.
[279:48.07]What are the chances of a real saw happening in there or they're watching a movie?
[279:53.56]It would actually be so awesome.
[279:55.10]I would laugh my ass off if I heard, like, through, like, the wall, like, let's play a game before you leave the gas in the room.
[280:02.98]Actually, and the bass booming would be amazing.
[280:05.06]All I'm saying is that there was a couple of movies that I've seen where it is just a clear one human man or human woman.
[280:15.13]screaming loud as loud as they can and it's all that's on the scene so I don't know if you're walking your dog or something and you walk by the person's house that's just a there's just a lady screaming like loud through the fucking wall I don't know it's fucking weird to me so now I'm like I gotta turn the fucking volume down whenever I whenever I know the killer's gonna kill somebody I turn the volume down by like three notches
[280:38.33]No, I'm actually with you.
[280:39.27]I'd do the same thing.
[280:40.62]Just in case someone's hearing you.
[280:41.90]I actually totally agree.
[280:43.36]Because just in case.
[280:44.63]They don't want to think you're a murderer or something terrible is happening.
[280:48.72]I mean, I heard, this is my old apartment.
[280:51.37]I heard my neighbors fighting with each other, like in a fight, like just like, you know, raising their voices.
[280:58.18]So I texted them and I said, everything okay?
[281:00.67]And then they stopped it immediately.
[281:02.27]Oh my God, dude.
[281:03.09]The worst decision I've ever made.
[281:04.50]Whoa.
[281:06.50]It was so cringe.
[281:08.29]Oh my God.
[281:09.72]I know it's like the anxiety that's so awful it was horrible I just I just never acknowledged them again oh my god I know it was like I should have never texted anything I don't know why I don't know why I just was like hey everything everything good and then instantly I heard them like shush each other and I just well because but to your defense though right like
[281:30.40]if you hear something that's bad like right like what do you do what do you like oh maybe I should say do you say something do you do you approach somebody you call somebody I mean there's noise like there's noise complaints right for a reason it was cringe like I guess like they stopped they stopped uh fighting because they're like what the is the neighbor texting us somebody said you saved their marriage yeah there you go it worked
[281:55.40]people argue stay out of it yeah I mean I I agree I think that there's but it I think it's weird if you like it through the wall yeah it was loud like I was like oh is everything alright how loud like I could hear every word like it was like you could hear everything
[282:12.68]but I mean the apartment walls were so thin so I could hear like everything all the time anyway maybe wait till the next day then check I yeah it's we have such awkward interactions with each other as humans yeah like and then if you wait to the next day like god forbid something terrible you know like I don't know yeah I just feel weird about it does auto bark at my no auto auto doesn't bark like ever
[282:42.61]Well, okay, a follow-up question.
[282:44.56]You were on speaking terms, like, you seem pretty on speaking terms with these people.
[282:48.88]Okay.
[282:50.10]I mean, you have their number, right?
[282:51.99]Okay, but here's something that you might find insane that I do.
[282:54.81]Whenever I move, I make cookies, like, just like the ones from the package, and I introduce myself to the neighbors and exchange numbers.
[283:02.66]Okay.
[283:04.77]Because I'm like, hey, if you need anything or if you want whatever, like, feel free to call me or whatever.
[283:09.45]Just like a security thing.
[283:11.03]Okay.
[283:11.92]No, that's fine.
[283:15.49]Yeah, so that's why I have everyone's number.
[283:19.03]Okay, okay.
[283:19.27]Because I don't know if you were friends with them or you knew them, but you exchanged cookies.
[283:24.84]Yeah, I always do the Scooby-Doo cookies, funny enough.
[283:28.33]The Pillsbury ones, they're really good.
[283:32.17]Somebody said, I do everything in my power to not speak to my neighbors.
[283:35.67]Yeah, but then you're always gonna have an awkward moment, then someone has to break the ice, and nobody wants to be that guy, you just have to be like, hey, like, just one day.
[283:41.63]I know, I know, I know, but then, I'm gonna hit you with this, but then, it's like, okay, if somebody wants to level up from neighbor to, like, friend, it's like, what if you don't want to do that, right?
[283:56.31]It's like, oh, hey, man, why don't we fucking chill tomorrow?
[283:59.07]It's like, oh, I didn't want to level up from neighbor to friend.
[284:04.95]And how do you say that to somebody?
[284:07.09]Just say, I can't.
[284:08.07]I'm sorry, I can't.
[284:08.79]I'm busy.
[284:09.95]Okay, but what if you can't every time that they ask?
[284:13.92]Then they'll get the vibe.
[284:14.86]They'll understand.
[284:15.66]That's like, have you ever had a friend that you thought they were closer to you and they asked you to pick them up from the airport?
[284:22.69]And you're like, what?
[284:24.01]We are not there quite yet.
[284:27.12]What are you talking about?
[284:28.30]I'm not going to pick you up.
[284:30.76]Like, get real.
[284:33.23]You have to really feel like somebody out in a way to be like, okay, wait, are we leveling up from neighbor to friend?
[284:39.30]Are we leveling up from acquaintance to friend?
[284:41.48]Yeah.
[284:41.98]Squeaks, I could ask you this.
[284:43.20]Squeaks, have we leveled up from neighbor to friend?
[284:47.09]I would say so.
[284:48.19]You're going to message me on Discord saying, hey, I heard some unsavory things.
[284:54.32]With this ghost pepper thing, I'm going to be busy.
[284:57.31]I probably don't I'm not gonna have time maybe maybe sometime of the two people with in red with the negative next to it like you can even save some time just an emote would work but it is it is like a delicate dance to like make friends and keep friends and talk to people and get people under oh I'm cool with you you're cool with me it is like a little this is a little dance isn't it
[285:22.77]No, 100%.
[285:24.30]But like the, you know, also there's certain friends are like, you're not texting me every day.
[285:29.08]You hate me.
[285:30.72]It's like, no, come on.
[285:32.58]We're past this.
[285:34.29]I sometimes I just want to throw my fucking phone to the ocean.
[285:37.07]I swear.
[285:37.75]Yeah.
[285:38.45]No, I'm with you.
[285:42.75]Oh, my God.
[285:43.08]You're KO'd.
[285:44.28]I'm stunned.
[285:47.86]Oh, no.
[285:50.36]No.
[285:52.36]You hate having friends?
[285:53.64]No, I love my friends.
[285:55.90]I have a ton of great friends.
[285:58.28]It's just... Yeah, with all different expectations.
[286:02.03]Yeah, it's just... I get it.
[286:05.62]I get how it can get overwhelming, especially in the digital age where everybody just can text you and everybody wants to text you.
[286:11.84]We got like read receipts people have on that they want to keep on.
[286:15.71]Oh, God.
[286:16.91]See, but I don't do texting.
[286:18.19]I do phone calls.
[286:20.28]Yeah, I'm the same way.
[286:22.39]Like, I don't want to get into a text chain with someone.
[286:24.56]I'll just pick up, I'll just start calling them when they start texting me.
[286:28.40]Yeah, because context and stuff can be lost in text, because you might be like, wait, is he mad at me?
[286:33.73]Yeah.
[286:34.28]Although, no, that's just, he just said, cool, bro.
[286:36.42]He just doesn't use emojis.
[286:37.86]Like, that's it.
[286:38.66]He's not mad.
[286:39.45]Was that a mad cool bro, or was that like a sarcastic cool bro?
[286:43.71]Yeah.
[286:44.26]Because on the phone, he'd be like, cool, bro.
[286:45.99]And I'd be like, whoa, nice.
[286:48.33]And then texting metas change, too.
[286:50.50]Like, now it's like crying emoji.
[286:52.42]And it's like, oh, my God, everything okay?
[286:53.83]And they're like, no, I'm laughing.
[286:55.65]Like, what?
[286:57.13]I don't get it.
[286:58.94]I don't use it.
[287:00.45]The only emojis I've ever used... I'll type them into my chat right now.
[287:04.85]I've done this one.
[287:06.63]I've done this one, and people won't stop giving me shit.
[287:10.06]I did this like once 12 years ago.
[287:14.24]Sometimes this one can pop up, but I don't do this one anymore.
[287:16.65]Because it's like way too... Hold on.
[287:19.29]This one, and then...
[287:22.72]I don't do that one.
[287:23.54]These are the three that I've only ever used.
[287:25.80]And that middle one I've used literally twice in my whole life.
[287:28.63]And people were like, oh wow, why does he type like this?
[287:31.75]I wrote it once ever in my entire fucking 39 years on the planet.
[287:35.85]Colon three.
[287:37.54]I did a colon three one time in my entire fucking life.
[287:44.80]And it's part of my personality now.
[287:47.81]Colon three.
[287:49.51]Have you ever done up caret underscore up caret?
[287:52.51]No, I have not.
[287:54.45]I used to do that.
[287:56.23]I'd also XD.
[287:58.98]I never XD'd either.
[288:06.69]Okay, well you're missing out.
[288:08.07]There used to be an XD age.
[288:09.83]My Steam name used to be Squeaks XD.
[288:13.34]Oh, you should have kept it.
[288:14.92]That would have been so fun.
[288:16.08]I really should have.
[288:16.93]I should have.
[288:19.07]Now it's just fucking boring Squeaks.
[288:21.75]No, I'd never Roar XD.
[288:23.71]That's too much.
[288:26.07]That would be crazy.
[288:28.05]I have some class.
[288:29.00]I think Squeaks is a great name.
[288:30.18]Squeaks is an iconic name.
[288:31.80]It's easy to remember.
[288:34.52]You're the only person that really has that.
[288:36.44]I think it's a good name.
[288:38.76]Yeah, I mean, I've had it since I was like 11 years old.
[288:41.53]So I don't even think about it anymore.
[288:44.87]Squeaks.
[288:47.41]Squeaks.
[288:48.77]Alright.
[288:49.51]Well, that's the end of the stream.
[288:50.31]We ended the stream like 40 minutes ago, but kept talking.
[288:53.27]Kept talking.
[288:55.53]That was so fun, Jerma.
[288:57.14]I really enjoyed it as always.
[288:59.54]And yeah, we I'll hit you up in DMs.
[289:04.78]We'll get the we'll get the ghost pepper challenge done.
[289:09.19]Yes, we've got to do that.
[289:10.99]That'll be fun.
[289:12.59]I actually am really looking forward to that.
[289:13.71]We'll do that soon.
[289:15.24]Yes, for sure.
[289:16.69]The real ghost, and for those of you that just joined, we are having a ghost pepper challenge for real.
[289:21.73]You're not going to want to miss it.
[289:23.53]The previous statement made by Squeaks Incorporated was a parody statement that was meant for entertainment purposes only, and for no reason should you believe that it was anything otherwise.
[289:33.08]Likewise.
[289:34.44]Yes, that's going to be a big bottom of the sock.
[289:36.51]That's going to be a long, that's going to be a sentence.
[289:39.39]That's a full paragraph of disclosure, which is completely real.
[289:44.84]Alright, we'll make it happen.
[289:46.06]I'll talk to you soon, though.
[289:46.73]Alrighty.
[289:47.29]Talk to you soon.
[289:48.47]Later.
[289:49.05]Take care.
[289:51.93]Always good to hang out with Squeaks.
[289:53.27]I think that's a hilarious idea, so we're definitely doing it.
[289:59.24]You guys gotta keep it together, though.
[290:00.58]If you guys can't keep it together, then the whole thing falls apart.
[290:05.47]I have to keep it together.
[290:12.42]But yeah, I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[290:14.86]I might play some water park simulator and then we may do some horseman stuff.
[290:29.23]So that'll be fun.
[290:37.36]I don't have a time on Thursday yet, but just keep an eye on the sus.
[290:40.56]Like tomorrow night, Thursday morning.
[290:46.56]But yeah, I knew I wanted to play all these hurdle games.
[290:49.66]I did a little bit a few weeks ago, but this was definitely a fun one.
[290:54.59]I know Squeaks and I talked about it previously.
[290:57.79]I think we actually did pretty well.
[290:59.39]We beat Turtles in Time without rewinds or cheating or safe states.
[291:05.92]I think we got pretty damn far in that NES one.
[291:08.91]That was probably the last screen before the last boss, honestly.
[291:12.63]I think we did pretty good.
[291:23.89]Oh, the music is still going.
[291:25.17]Oops.
[291:29.91]It was two more levels after that?
[291:31.41]Oh my god.
[291:33.29]So hard.
[291:35.73]But yeah, I'll see you guys later.
[291:37.21]See you on Thursday.
[291:38.21]Take care.
[291:38.85]Call your mother.
[291:39.41]You know the deal.
[291:40.18]See you soon.
[291:42.36]And... By the way, that week stream of us eating the ghost peppers is just... We're just going to do it.
[291:50.04]It's just going to go on to the book at some point.
[291:51.95]I don't think we're going to be like a big plan on it.
[291:53.83]I think we're just going to pick a day.
[291:56.97]But... See you later.
[292:38.91]I just realized I don't have my outro screen here.
[292:41.68]Why?
[292:43.31]Well, just pretend you saw it.
[292:45.67]See you later.
