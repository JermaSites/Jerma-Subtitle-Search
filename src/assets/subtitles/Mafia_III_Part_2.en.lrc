[ve:60.16.100]

[01:13.30]alright hi so I want to talk about mods because I've been modding people a lot last like two or three days well two days well one day you know if you're wondering how that's working uh yesterday I couldn't figure out how to turn off sub mode
[01:35.84]And got to a point where I had to mod a bunch of people to have somebody do it.
[01:41.32]And I've had the same mods for like four years.
[01:46.51]I'm pretty sure I've had the same roster of like 15 to 20 mods.
[01:53.03]At least this current string for at least two years.
[01:56.37]And I had to, I got to start modding more people.
[02:00.01]So this is how it's going to work.
[02:02.56]If you are a mod right now, then you have much more access to the chat.
[02:07.84]Because, of course, I can look over.
[02:09.50]I'm playing the game.
[02:10.32]I'm doing whatever I'm doing on stream.
[02:11.46]But if I look over and pull out a comment or respond to what somebody said or see what's going on, what people are talking about, I can only really do that so often.
[02:19.74]I can't, like, focus 100% on the chat at all times.
[02:23.71]But mods can.
[02:25.47]So...
[02:27.18]Their job is to sort of see who's saying interesting things and who's around and who's like a good candidate.
[02:36.18]They're going to be the ones to determine who the new mods are.
[02:40.29]Because I trust at least the first wave.
[02:43.69]Guys like Sebix have been here for years.
[02:47.81]And originally, I think they came from Starz stream years ago.
[02:55.53]So that's how it's going to work now.
[02:56.87]If you're a mod right now, if you got randomly modded, then chances are I've recognized your name, I've seen you around, or I randomly modded you yesterday.
[03:10.72]But there you go.
[03:12.02]That's how it's going to work.
[03:14.84]You've got to feel my best behavior.
[03:18.97]And it doesn't matter.
[03:19.61]Also, I don't think I'm ever going to do one of those things where
[03:24.42]If you give 100 bucks or 200 bucks, then you get to be a mod.
[03:29.70]That's never... That's not the case.
[03:33.32]I think there's actually a couple mods right now that aren't even subscribed to the channel, so... It's... That's not part of the criteria if you're going to be a mod.
[03:43.97]But that's how it's going to work, and we're going to play Mafia tonight.
[03:47.43]Should be fun.
[03:50.62]Be a mod is so much power.
[03:54.48]Oh, the new starting?
[03:55.08]Yeah, I made a new starting screen.
[04:01.95]You like my little ant person?
[04:05.81]That's supposed to be me.
[04:08.06]I'm getting, like, ready.
[04:08.74]I'm doing a little tap dance.
[04:12.20]So first of all, we got starting soon.
[04:14.28]You know that as you're watching, it's going to be happening soon.
[04:17.38]You got a guy doing a little tap dance, which is me tap dancing.
[04:20.69]And then underneath is the game.
[04:22.73]By the way, I'm getting a real starting soon screen in like two or three weeks.
[04:27.71]Whenever Blordow gets done and we transfer some funds because he's doing a lot of work.
[04:37.64]So it's going to be good.
[04:39.94]Can't wait.
[04:42.95]I'm going to smack myself in the back of the head a few times.
[04:49.00]I'm going to grab a couple of things to get started.
[04:51.86]We're about 30 minutes early, so just hang tight.
[04:55.22]I'll be back in a minute or two.
[04:57.04]See you in a minute.
[07:06.86]He's in the bathroom.
[07:07.94]I can feel it.
[07:08.80]I'm not in the bathroom.
[07:09.82]I'm here now.
[07:11.96]Alright.
[07:12.32]I want to test something because yesterday there's a really weird audio delay.
[07:17.88]There was like a 60 to 70 millisecond audio delay on when I was doing anything in Dark Souls.
[07:23.51]I think it was just a Dark Souls 3 problem.
[07:26.77]But before I really get going, I want to make sure it's not something on my end or on OBS's end.
[07:32.84]So we're going to do this.
[07:33.88]I want you guys to tell me if there is an audio delay.
[07:40.28]If there is an audio delay, you got to let me know.
[07:44.04]Switch over to it.
[07:44.64]And when I mean audio delay, when I like shoot this gun or when I punch...
[07:57.12]Let me know what's going on.
[08:00.06]Is there a delay in the audio?
[08:02.50]Ready?
[08:04.34]Hold on.
[08:06.88]Do I have any ammo?
[08:10.02]Okay.
[08:10.70]I don't have any fucking ammo.
[08:12.46]Oh god, I pressed tab accidentally.
[08:15.43]Alright, I'm fine.
[08:18.31]I'll do it with the car.
[08:23.67]No, there isn't.
[08:24.89]Here we go.
[08:25.11]Ready?
[08:25.23]Ready?
[08:29.91]When I'm crashing, does the crash happen like a second later?
[08:33.20]I'll get out and punch too.
[08:44.82]I gotta go punch somebody in the face.
[08:51.25]No delay?
[08:52.71]It's all good?
[08:53.41]Okay.
[08:53.63]I don't even know how to... What even is the horn button?
[08:57.70]Alright, ready?
[08:58.06]So this is a good time to test it.
[08:59.40]Like, can you hear an audio delay?
[09:03.12]Okay, was there a delay?
[09:05.23]When I punched that person in the face?
[09:09.47]How about now?
[09:11.15]How about now?
[09:11.61]Is there a delay?
[09:12.87]Hey, excuse me, sir.
[09:16.28]I'm trying to test if there's an audio delay in my stream.
[09:18.98]Can you help me test it?
[09:25.70]No delay.
[09:26.36]Okay, good.
[09:27.62]We're ready to play.
[09:31.91]Thanks a lot, uh... Oh, shit, I do have a gun.
[09:34.87]Put it away.
[09:40.79]This guy's got no fear, huh?
[09:44.91]This is like, holy shit, this guy's got a gun!
[09:47.39]I'm gonna eat my... Oh, I thought it was cupcakes.
[09:50.83]He's got flowers.
[09:54.46]Is that this guy's head?
[10:03.48]You've dropped your flowers, man.
[10:09.40]That one is the best.
[10:14.65]It really is.
[10:18.43]Alright, so last time we played Mafia... He knows I don't have any ammo.
[10:23.75]Last time I played Mafia, we ended... I think we were doing this...
[10:29.54]We had to go clear out this place.
[10:31.10]Because I don't really have any missions.
[10:34.42]I guess I could go up here.
[10:35.80]Sammy's bar.
[10:36.42]Oh, I'm going to stash my money.
[10:39.98]That's a good idea.
[10:41.76]That's the nicest person.
[10:46.10]Hold on.
[10:46.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:47.40]Is it a witness?
[10:50.08]Okay.
[10:58.29]I dropped his drink Alright, no more witnesses apparently no more witnesses Just that guy sprinting drinking it like two o'clock in the afternoon.
[11:08.82]I just got a sandwich Oh Boys alright.
[11:14.76]See you later It was fun
[11:27.76]This guy's just drinking.
[11:28.82]This guy's like shit-faced at fucking 12.30.
[11:32.08]Oh shit, I better call the cops!
[11:36.30]I'm the only one that cares.
[11:40.59]Thanks a lot, Crazy Carl, for nine months.
[11:47.17]Where's our baby?
[11:47.93]I don't know.
[11:50.07]I didn't know I was... I didn't think I was pregnant.
[11:52.32]I guess I was.
[11:54.08]Notifications aren't working.
[11:54.98]They should be.
[11:55.40]Let me make sure that that's going on.
[11:58.06]Because I can hear them.
[12:00.70]They should be going on.
[12:01.36]They should be working.
[12:03.14]Resubs don't show up.
[12:04.79]What?
[12:07.71]Wait.
[12:09.95]There they are.
[12:10.51]I can see them.
[12:14.97]Are you guys just pulling my chain?
[12:17.67]Because I just saw a dead prisoner.
[12:21.09]Eight months right there.
[12:24.67]Crazy Carl.
[12:26.21]See, they're showing up.
[12:27.61]They're fine.
[12:28.81]And where did all my shit just go?
[12:30.01]I'm not scary like that, guys.
[12:40.98]Alright, let's get back in the game.
[12:45.22]Some were missing.
[12:45.92]I hope it has nothing to do with me being in Mafia.
[12:50.55]Just being, like, actually physically in Mafia.
[12:52.87]Hopefully that's not the case.
[12:57.54]Twitch Prime isn't showing up.
[12:58.99]There's always weird issues with Twitch alerts, isn't there?
[13:03.87]But nonetheless, thanks Cannibal Lobster for the sub.
[13:06.77]Thanks Dead Prisoner for eight months.
[13:09.52]Crazy Carl, thank you for nine months.
[13:12.08]Mr. Duck Plays for eight months.
[13:14.26]I think I missed one more person.
[13:15.34]Let me make sure I say hello to Chewy Rock for eight months.
[13:18.94]Also, The Hat-Wearing Goose, Masharoni, Mr. Banana Man, and Darkend12 from yesterday.
[13:25.51]So we're caught up.
[13:27.11]All the new subs.
[13:28.03]Thanks a lot, guys and dolls.
[13:32.77]Will I ever stream Bloodborne?
[13:34.43]No.
[13:37.01]Probably not.
[13:38.91]I've played it too many times where me streaming it would just be me running through the motions and killing bosses and doing stuff that I've already done a thousand times.
[13:47.24]So probably not.
[13:52.86]I need to stash my money.
[13:54.56]How do I get in?
[13:59.90]So this whole place is like burnt down.
[14:01.32]How do I get actually into the living room?
[14:14.04]What the hell?
[14:14.66]Where's the safe?
[14:17.10]What's further down do I gotta go?
[14:18.20]Nah, it's in here.
[14:24.10]There we go.
[14:27.47]I would love to stash my money.
[14:32.07]Thank you, compromise.
[14:33.09]Welcome.
[14:35.13]Alright.
[14:35.61]Stashed, right?
[14:36.45]Done.
[14:38.29]Where the hell am I gonna go?
[14:40.55]This prostitution thing that I've done before...
[14:44.25]I already took out this one.
[14:46.64]Turn to the voice.
[14:48.52]Alright.
[14:49.28]Turn to the voice.
[14:52.36]I wanted to stash my money in case I got in some trouble.
[14:56.86]My mommy says I can't play this game.
[15:01.06]Well, your mommy's probably right.
[15:03.23]Because it is an M-rated game and it's a very intense game, so...
[15:13.26]By the way, I like how I just stole this weird buggy.
[15:18.86]This thing's a shitbox.
[15:25.84]Remember, it's left, left, straight, right, right, straight, left.
[15:33.93]What are you talking about?
[15:35.27]Yeah, it's rated M for mommy only.
[15:40.69]Only mommies are allowed to play this game.
[15:43.97]What is this, Fifty Shades of Gray?
[15:46.61]Only mommies allowed.
[15:47.72]Oh, shut up.
[15:53.06]Get out of my way.
[15:54.76]Get out of my way, you fucking wanker.
[15:59.18]Get out of the car.
[16:00.06]Alright, on to the voice.
[16:06.89]Can't wait to do NBC's The Voice.
[16:08.27]I hope I got the talent to do it.
[16:15.95]What's next?
[16:21.56]Where's the guy?
[16:22.34]Talk to the voice continuing, causing remaining... Yeah, whatever.
[16:25.60]Mm-hmm.
[16:26.12]Oh, Jesus.
[16:26.34]Terma is a mommy?
[16:26.96]Oh, my goodness.
[16:50.69]Killer Crocomire.
[16:54.57]With the 50 fucking dollars.
[17:01.02]Thanks, Killer Crocomire.
[17:02.70]Please set up an actual donation thing so I can put this money directly into the Clown Car Fund.
[17:06.72]I don't want Twitch to take a percentage, bro.
[17:08.54]Many others would probably like this, too.
[17:11.68]Yeah, I have to set up a... I don't know.
[17:16.82]Let's get in the boat, and we'll talk about it.
[17:19.78]But thank you, dude.
[17:20.56]That's... That's very appreciated.
[17:23.40]Much love to you.
[17:25.55]But to respond to what you're saying... PayPal donations just scare the shit out of me.
[17:32.57]They do.
[17:34.93]Mostly because... If you give somebody a way to... I'm not gonna lie, I was not even looking at the game.
[17:42.52]I was staring at the chat.
[17:43.52]Wait, what?! !
[17:45.53]Alright, we made it under the tubes.
[17:46.73]That's good.
[17:49.75]I don't... I know it's stupid to say it.
[17:52.85]I know it's like a fucking dumb thing to say.
[17:55.97]But... What the fuck?
[17:58.55]Hold on.
[17:58.99]Go ahead, call him.
[18:04.52]Call him!
[18:05.40]Give him a call!
[18:08.22]Yeah?
[18:15.92]Where are we sending the officers?
[18:18.26]Send your officers now.
[18:22.38]Sir, we don't know where the fuck you are.
[18:24.97]Like when I see, when I hear about people like, yeah, there's been a guy that's, I can't even like, I can't even talk seriously while I play this game.
[18:38.28]Fucking, yeah, go, okay, bye, another one, see ya.
[18:50.08]She doesn't care.
[18:51.12]That's not a witness.
[18:55.08]Yeah, she thinks they're both drunk.
[18:56.62]Yeah, this city's really going to shit.
[18:58.44]You're right.
[18:59.58]These two drunk, drunk assholes.
[19:03.22]I know.
[19:04.13]By the way, thanks for the fucking car.
[19:10.63]Who's the witness?
[19:13.37]I just took her car.
[19:14.89]Didn't I?
[19:18.45]through the bowl alright as I was saying I can't even talk I can't even do this I have to take oh my god alright now that I have a second nobody else call the police I can call in associates I'm gonna take a second here so anytime I hear about somebody getting
[19:46.72]Like, oh yeah, open up just straight up donations because we want to give money.
[19:50.12]We want to give a bunch of money.
[19:52.76]It's, I don't know, man.
[19:55.72]Even if I take in, if somebody pays like 100 bucks, like 10 times over the course of a year or something like that, then yeah, they have given like $1,000 or $2,000 over the course of a certain, and that's awesome.
[20:08.43]That's like crazy and like awesome for me to even think that that would be possible that somebody would care about doing that, right?
[20:14.23]But just like I don't want to have it be a situation where somebody drops like fucking two, three thousand dollars, like five thousand dollars in PayPal.
[20:24.77]That scares the shit out of me.
[20:29.18]This terrifies me because it's like that's a huge amount of money in one.
[20:33.78]Like, I know I don't know your situation.
[20:35.28]I don't know like what you do, what your plans are, where you're going or if you have you're a fucking rich guy, if you're not.
[20:41.39]But bits at least keep it to a point where maybe people won't throw fucking like tens of thousands of dollars at this channel.
[20:51.48]You know what I mean?
[20:52.42]Like I don't want people to fucking spend their paychecks on me.
[21:00.98]If that makes any sense.
[21:01.94]And yeah, like I said, there's already been people that have given a lot of money.
[21:07.20]But spread out, I like I'm OK with it spread out.
[21:10.80]But with people, you give people complete freedom with PayPal.
[21:16.34]I don't even want to know.
[21:17.90]And I see some of these streamers that they pull in these like five thousand dollar donations and I'm just like, oh, that's that's crazy.
[21:25.41]That's so much fucking money in one second.
[21:36.64]It's like I don't want you to fucking think that you have to give this channel a bunch of money.
[21:45.41]I know a lot of you guys are in college and shit.
[21:47.45]I don't want to take your fucking savings.
[21:52.95]Go buy a fucking Xbox.
[22:01.16]Are you an arms dealer?
[22:03.02]They already told me how to do this.
[22:05.71]Although I probably should do this, considering I don't have any ammo.
[22:07.77]A million dollars.
[22:12.84]Jesus!
[22:12.98]That guy just sideswiped me.
[22:14.16]And look, it's not a question of... Really?
[22:34.90]Get the hell out of my way.
[22:37.36]It's not a question of I don't want... Of course I'm streaming right now.
[22:42.93]I do this a lot.
[22:44.73]I make YouTube videos and I stream.
[22:47.87]That's what I do.
[22:50.49]It's not that I don't... Oh yeah, I don't want to take your money.
[22:53.48]I just don't want to take a massive fucking amount of it in one sitting.
[23:00.80]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[23:01.34]This is a console game.
[23:05.66]Uh, I'm just gonna refill up my ammo.
[23:13.38]Bought an Xbox.
[23:14.04]What should I buy next?
[23:17.67]And the people that have given, like, that much money, like, you don't know, like, how much that actually means to know that somebody wants to pay you that kind of money.
[23:29.76]There's a witness calling the police.
[23:30.82]I don't know where they are.
[23:36.08]Mafia, the witness it is.
[23:37.34]There is no witness.
[23:39.62]There was no witness.
[23:40.52]They lied to me.
[23:43.62]I just broke this lady's hip.
[23:48.76]I'm just going to get out of here.
[23:55.84]Can't go in the front door?
[23:56.58]It was merely a joke.
[24:05.93]I'll have to hide for a second.
[24:07.21]I'm going to finish my train of thought.
[24:10.71]So we're going to hide behind this wall.
[24:13.83]Final train of thought here is... If you want to give this channel money, if you want to pay me money, I fucking love you.
[24:22.78]That's great.
[24:23.60]I'm glad.
[24:25.24]I'm happy to take your money.
[24:27.54]But opening up straight up donations, like PayPal donations that don't have a tier system or...
[24:35.31]You know, you go like, bitch, you can just drop like a hundred, like a buck, or like two bucks.
[24:38.93]I know you can do that in PayPal too, but opening up the floodgates like that for somebody just to throw as much money as they can, I'm very uncomfortable with it.
[24:50.98]Because at least with Twitch, you're getting kind of like a little bit of a service.
[24:54.93]You're getting...
[24:56.26]the badge, you're getting the, like, the notifications, and eventually there'll be more notifications, I'm doing custom ones.
[25:02.63]But there's, like, something that you're kind of feasibly purchasing than just straight up dumping money into a PayPal account.
[25:19.34]But thanks to, uh, thanks to you, I love you regardless, don't worry.
[25:25.93]If you don't take PayPal, can I just mail you a check?
[25:30.65]Plus, with donations, people can claim it back.
[25:32.44]That's another thing, too.
[25:33.28]I know that's, like, harder to do nowadays, but it's still a thing.
[25:36.90]And let's say somebody drops $1,000 in PayPal, right?
[25:40.02]Holy shit!
[25:41.80]And everyone goes crazy.
[25:42.80]What the fuck?
[25:43.64]Somebody just gave a fucking grand!
[25:46.02]Everyone freaks the fuck out.
[25:47.61]And, like, what if I go spend that money?
[25:49.51]Like, I go, oh, yeah, let me take that $1,000.
[25:51.21]I'm gonna go buy, like, a computer upgrade.
[25:54.55]And it gets charge-backed.
[25:56.87]Oh, my God, what the fuck am I going to do?
[26:00.69]So Twitch is like more the word I'm trying to look for here is legitimized, right?
[26:07.37]Patreon is also legitimized, but with Patreon.
[26:12.73]Like you need to be paying for something, in my opinion.
[26:19.13]And straight up PayPal donations, you're not necessarily paying for something, you're.
[26:25.46]Just money is disappearing.
[26:30.76]With that being said, like, go ahead and throw some fucking bits my way!
[26:34.56]No.
[26:37.72]I was just kidding.
[26:40.37]We think your content is worth that money?
[26:42.05]Yeah, but... It's... I know.
[26:46.93]I'm just a fucking weirdo.
[26:48.97]End of story, final thought.
[26:50.63]I'm fucking weird.
[26:52.61]And never expected that my life was going to get to a point where people were going to want to give me a thousand fucking dollars.
[26:59.05]It's like, you know, it's not like it's I've never fucking thought that I was going to be in a situation that I've been right this second right now.
[27:06.25]So I love you all.
[27:08.21]Don't worry.
[27:09.37]That's the final thought I'm going to say.
[27:10.47]We're going to move on.
[27:11.11]I feel like I'm beating a dead horse now.
[27:16.05]Yeah, we'll move on.
[27:17.44]Thank you, Googly Gareth, for the... Speaking of bits, speaking of... Googly Gareth with the 100 bits.
[27:22.60]Needs me with 100 bits.
[27:24.12]SuperJet000 subscribed.
[27:26.76]SirTeamAss subscribed.
[27:27.78]Look at these fucking bits rolling in.
[27:29.40]Guys, keep the bits going.
[27:31.00]The bit train.
[27:34.32]God, let me just fucking completely ruin the real talk I was just having.
[27:39.50]But thanks, NeedsMe.
[27:40.37]Thanks, Arrow to the face.
[27:42.62]Thank you, Uber Chemist, for your six months.
[27:45.22]Thanks, Ignatius, Professor Ignatius, for eight months.
[27:49.01]Obviously, we saw Crockemeyer come in with the fucking five grand.
[27:54.93]Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.
[27:58.11]I can't say shit like that, even as a joke.
[28:04.56]BitGet.
[28:05.90]Alright, abandoned search.
[28:09.90]The cops got, like, tired of me talking about bits.
[28:14.68]Yeah, I think I hear a guy over there, but all I hear is some shit about bits.
[28:19.99]No, no, I gotta be here.
[28:23.51]Thanks a lot, ProNation.
[28:26.41]And Mr. Wimpy.
[28:28.11]How do I get in here?
[28:30.07]I gotta go in here and kill somebody, right?
[28:31.33]Oh, okay, here we go.
[28:33.87]Hostile zone?
[28:38.85]If I go in here, I'm gonna have to be in a fight.
[28:44.37]I have guns.
[28:45.47]I have weapons.
[28:46.87]Alright, well, these guys are hostile.
[28:48.81]Why don't I just go across the street and just snipe them?
[28:57.62]What's the crouch button?
[29:00.04]Oh, there is one.
[29:00.56]Alright, well, let's do this.
[29:05.24]Just snipe the bad guys.
[29:06.42]These guys are going to shoot at me regardless, right?
[29:16.14]Alright, where's the next guy?
[29:18.12]Show your face.
[29:18.78]I'm not even zoomed in and I got a guy.
[29:25.91]I just no-scoped that guy.
[29:34.35]What?
[29:39.24]What a psycho.
[29:40.00]Alright.
[29:46.89]No big deal.
[29:47.45]Alright, front door is clear.
[29:53.28]We gotta clear front door.
[29:54.22]We gotta go kill Mr. Jackson.
[29:56.04]Merrill Jackson.
[29:58.88]Where's this guy?
[30:10.17]Where the fuck did that guy go?
[30:12.07]Oh, he's right next to me.
[30:15.06]I just jump scared that guy.
[30:28.61]this shit right now, man.
[30:33.62]That guy just lobbed it into the air.
[30:35.36]Above him.
[30:40.56]Did I shoot it out of his hand?
[30:43.02]I think I shot it out of his hand.
[30:44.28]Ooh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[30:52.47]Upstairs?
[30:55.75]Where are these guys?
[31:02.72]No, you're not in the kitchen.
[31:03.94]I can't believe that guy torched himself.
[31:14.79]Well, I mean, I can't hide, but... I can't just instantly kill you.
[31:31.54]Whatever, reed.
[31:33.70]If I had to eat 10 pounds of spaghetti, but you could only have one topping on the spaghetti, what would you choose?
[31:37.58]Uh, meatballs.
[31:41.26]Does that count as a topping?
[31:43.01]I don't think so.
[31:43.51]It should.
[31:46.57]That gives you your protein, that gives you your meat and cheese.
[31:49.03]This guy's alive.
[31:49.69]This guy was just talking.
[32:02.73]This guy is not asking if I'm around, is he?
[32:04.87]I think he might be.
[32:14.10]No, he's dead.
[32:15.78]He's very much dead.
[32:18.86]Oh, bits.
[32:21.90]I think that was the guy.
[32:23.98]I win, right?
[32:31.68]Oh, Jesus.
[32:33.48]Oh, no.
[32:36.66]Oh, here come the bits.
[32:38.40]Here come... Why do I have the sniper rifle out?
[32:42.96]Why don't I have the sniper rifle?
[32:44.18]I missed.
[32:44.86]Just shoot him.
[32:46.08]Hold on.
[32:46.84]I'll say... I'll get to those bits in a second.
[32:49.06]I just want to make sure I don't die in here.
[32:50.24]Excuse me.
[32:53.25]Excuse me.
[32:58.90]Ooh, popped him.
[33:02.60]I'm going to get the health that's down here.
[33:06.68]Give me that health.
[33:09.16]Do I have to rescue people?
[33:10.18]Do I not have to do that anymore?
[33:13.80]Apparently not.
[33:19.40]I completely forgot I had hitman absolution mode.
[33:23.82]I hate that so much that I don't even want to use it.
[33:29.26]Does it work in this message?
[33:30.64]Wow!
[33:32.40]Okay, that guy really was coming out.
[33:39.71]He was not kidding when he said, here I fucking come.
[33:42.85]That means I'm actually going to come out the door and get you.
[33:44.99]Alright, I think this is the last little area.
[33:58.27]I think he's in here.
[34:04.83]Killing racket bosses.
[34:05.77]Neutralize racket boss.
[34:06.55]Take over a racket.
[34:07.39]Then call an underboss to send over their people to help secure the racket.
[34:11.69]Kill Merrill to break up the prostitution racket.
[34:14.37]Here we go.
[34:17.54]Where's my wheel?
[34:20.68]I don't have any grenades or anything.
[34:24.36]Motherfucker took some of our best girls.
[34:26.60]Can you get around it?
[34:41.20]I shot the guy right in the head.
[34:42.18]Look at the guy on the left.
[34:46.21]He's like, oh, is he still there?
[34:48.73]I dare you to open this door.
[34:55.19]Open this door.
[34:57.62]I double, double dare you.
[34:59.36]He just did that to the door and he did it to himself.
[35:26.00]What a moron.
[35:27.38]Hey, what's going on?
[35:29.56]Shorty Merrill McGee, whatever your fucking name is.
[35:38.98]Okay.
[35:39.92]Apparently I have to do this.
[35:46.28]Please throw one.
[35:48.74]Throw it.
[35:50.90]You know you want to throw one of those in the air and just get yourself torched.
[35:53.84]Come on.
[35:56.26]Look at me.
[35:57.34]Can you see me peeking through the window?
[36:00.40]I bet you don't even have one of those.
[36:01.57]I bet you don't even have one of those torches.
[36:04.93]Here he goes.
[36:12.24]Damn it.
[36:15.78]Oh, well.
[36:17.28]Let's do the...
[36:27.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:32.05]I kinda wanted to push this guy out into traffic.
[36:36.87]Oh, fuck off.
[36:39.33]You're ruining my fun.
[36:42.97]Don't ruin my fun.
[36:50.48]Oh, fine.
[36:51.42]Just fucking stick the knife in his face.
[36:53.56]Okay, I'm tapping Q.
[36:59.35]Am I missing something here?
[37:01.33]What am I missing?
[37:11.36]Oh wow, get fucking destroyed, buddy.
[37:20.54]Get fucking destroyed.
[37:33.14]Alright, what do we... I got $30,000 for that?
[37:41.85]Sure, I'll give it to Cassandra.
[37:46.97]What if I'm using his phone?
[37:49.32]Hey, by the way, come over here.
[37:51.28]In the meantime, I want to say...
[38:02.55]Thanks, Baked Flakes, jermaPop Quiz, and you... Oh, no, no, I know how this ends.
[38:06.24]I know how this ends.
[38:08.02]I know how this ends, Baked.
[38:09.76]I know how this ends.
[38:11.96]This is strike... This is strike three for me.
[38:14.12]I'm gonna... I'm... Hold on.
[38:20.13]Well, a lot of people... God damn.
[38:23.19]Thanks to everybody that gave the bits.
[38:24.53]Thanks to Awesome Sauce.
[38:26.47]Thanks to Lolladucho.
[38:29.25]Pronation, thanks a lot, dude.
[38:30.58]Thanks to Zach the Slaw.
[38:31.78]Thanks to Purple Pancakes.
[38:36.38]I'll check it out after this train, Purple.
[38:38.93]Killer Croc again with 5,000.
[38:39.89]You heard it, Chowerman Bits.
[38:43.62]Thank you, man.
[38:45.12]ShadeCS, thanks for the sub.
[38:47.24]Gyoro, eight months in a row, damn.
[38:49.56]It does work.
[38:50.72]Eight months.
[38:52.66]Carpington wrote a fucking paragraph.
[38:56.06]But thanks, nonetheless.
[38:57.92]RobotSwagMonkey and Nairoamy.
[39:01.45]Nairoamy.
[39:02.51]Nairoamy.
[39:04.33]Eight months and five months, respectively.
[39:05.49]Thanks a lot.
[39:06.39]And then BakeFlace wants me to answer his question.
[39:08.03]jermaPop Quiz, in your first team to comedy, what class did you play?
[39:13.23]played.
[39:13.61]I'm gonna get I'm gonna get it wrong.
[39:16.99]I played the engineer.
[39:25.77]I played the I was the engineer.
[39:34.51]No backflips.
[39:35.43]What?
[39:42.46]I got it wrong.
[39:43.18]I got it wrong.
[39:44.44]Yeah, it was the spy, actually.
[39:47.71]First ever video.
[39:50.05]Spy on Gold Rush with the Dead Ringer.
[39:57.26]In 1966, the FBI recruited me out of college.
[40:01.07]What an old video.
[40:01.67]It's like five years old.
[40:02.47]New mods, that's correct.
[40:03.07]There are new mods here.
[40:03.81]Delete my first ever video?
[40:04.45]No way.
[40:04.69]My third ever video is Grandpa playing Insane Aquarium.
[40:23.81]As a girl, she was kidnapped.
[40:25.67]Alright.
[40:26.55]Back to life by a voodoo priest.
[40:29.21]Baked flakes.
[40:30.05]Baked.
[40:30.29]I got it wrong.
[40:31.03]I got it wrong.
[40:32.80]She shot her own father.
[40:33.66]I got a second chance, I guess.
[40:35.78]It's impossible to know what's true.
[40:37.96]Thanks, dude.
[40:40.68]Wait, what?
[40:42.20]Thanks for the 10,000.
[40:46.70]Mr. Flakes.
[40:50.38]Where am I?
[40:50.70]Oh, I'm back here.
[40:51.40]Okay.
[40:53.89]Why did I start early?
[40:54.59]Because I want to be able to stream... I want the streams really to get going around like 7, 7.15 rather than start.
[41:03.12]But yeah, I think that's... That's like the third time you've done that, man.
[41:07.18]I appreciate it.
[41:08.90]Thanks a lot, man.
[41:11.20]And the Nicktree with five months, thanks a lot.
[41:12.92]Screaming?
[41:14.43]What?
[41:19.31]Hold G to throw Scream?
[41:21.07]Okay.
[41:21.23]Okay.
[41:25.74]I'm holding G. Didn't it say give me them for free?
[41:41.06]T4 just free crumbs out, yeah.
[41:42.94]That is, I do remember saying that.
[41:44.52]So this is now my place, my club.
[41:45.42]Cool.
[41:45.52]Oh, this place is really pumping now.
[41:58.67]Alright.
[41:59.31]Wait for Donovan.
[42:02.23]I'm gonna see that new thing I got.
[42:03.31]Everyone was telling me to hold G before.
[42:06.79]Thanks a lot, Zach.
[42:08.11]Uh... Where?
[42:10.53]The heck?
[42:12.17]Get over here, man.
[42:20.18]It is active.
[42:21.70]Why did he park so far away?
[42:24.32]Fuck.
[42:24.68]I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to shoot the gun.
[42:36.12]Trespassing on enemy turf?
[42:37.48]Why do I have a timer on this guy?
[42:41.86]Why is he this far along?
[42:42.60]He just, what is he doing?
[42:46.04]He just shut the doors on me.
[43:06.05]Where are you going?
[43:06.89]I was gonna buy shit.
[43:07.93]Alright, dude, you need to seriously calm down.
[43:18.02]Stop.
[43:19.68]Stop!
[43:21.12]Where are you going?
[43:23.44]He's going so fast.
[43:24.64]Okay.
[43:27.42]Nice.
[43:29.93]Very nice.
[43:30.45]Alright, let's take a look.
[43:33.99]Z...
[43:37.06]I'm running low.
[43:37.80]Can you send supplies to Del Rey Hollow?
[43:39.50]Be out directly.
[43:44.98]Oh, fuck.
[43:46.68]Heck, I don't care.
[43:48.16]He's just humming away.
[43:51.59]See anything you need?
[43:57.53]So this is it right here?
[43:58.45]This guy's not affected by anything.
[44:08.27]This guy, why do you not care about anything?
[44:11.49]Please care about something.
[44:18.91]No, he doesn't care.
[44:19.47]I can't even like, I can't target him.
[44:29.06]All I can do is bump into him.
[44:30.48]I'm not even hurting him.
[44:35.96]This guy is not killable, I don't think.
[44:38.78]Nope, he's not.
[44:42.62]Alright.
[44:44.80]So, let's... I'm going to refill my ammo.
[44:51.02]Ammo refill.
[44:51.89]I have money.
[44:53.53]I don't want to lose.
[44:54.29]Where are you going now?
[44:58.67]Hmm?
[44:58.81]You're going to take off without me telling you to?
[45:02.37]He shoots somebody, we're going to have to pick somebody.
[45:09.64]I landed and punched that lady.
[45:10.64]Didn't even mean to.
[45:11.10]Alright, back to... Wait for Donovan.
[45:16.36]Just go back in there and wait for him?
[45:20.66]He's an important story character?
[45:22.07]Oh, that's what it is.
[45:28.87]Let's go.
[45:32.13]By let's go, I mean let's drive into a tree.
[45:37.02]It's raining out.
[45:37.68]Give me a little bit of slack.
[45:38.80]It's raining.
[45:49.11]Donovan, you sure are far away from me to have to wait for you.
[45:54.00]Donovan.
[45:55.48]Wait a minute.
[45:58.34]Situation.
[46:03.32]Don't do it.
[46:04.74]I don't want to fucking kill this person.
[46:07.53]Oh, how do I do this?
[46:08.19]How do I do this?
[46:08.91]Non-lethal, non-lethal, non-lethal.
[46:10.75]How do I do it?
[46:12.41]How do I do it?
[46:13.79]That's how you do it.
[46:14.31]Okay, she's fine.
[46:15.97]She's gonna be alright.
[46:18.29]She'll wake up in about an hour or two and forget what happened.
[46:31.02]Shoot her, my god.
[46:40.79]My key will be broken?
[46:42.21]What does that mean?
[46:48.50]Here we go.
[46:49.80]Hey, Donovan.
[46:51.86]Is that Donovan?
[46:54.54]I don't think so.
[46:55.00]A couple of these missions where you just kind of sit on a bench.
[46:59.99]Surprise to see you out here.
[47:02.75]Decided to get some fresh air.
[47:06.21]That heroin the Dixie Mafia's been selling?
[47:08.29]It's run out of there by a man named Charlie Kincaid.
[47:11.66]Meaning all the other dealers around here kick up to him.
[47:13.65]The game runs like shit.
[47:14.69]It kind of does.
[47:15.77]You're going to have to put the squeeze on him.
[47:17.87]I flagged a couple of his guys.
[47:19.51]You get them to talk, they'll tell you how to get to him.
[47:22.69]Now, from what I hear, Charlie's only in this for the money.
[47:25.94]He's not a true believer like those other Dixie Mafia assholes.
[47:28.90]Yeah, there's going to be occasional frame drops.
[47:32.54]It's just the way the game is.
[47:34.80]Unfortunately.
[47:36.00]I got something I can help you with, Dad.
[47:37.38]That's what I wanted to show you.
[47:39.49]You think this guy's the bad guy?
[47:42.93]They already pulled that on us before.
[47:44.67]In the very beginning, the guy that was a good guy with us turned out to be a bad guy.
[47:48.77]And, like, this guy being a good guy now is a bad guy.
[47:51.93]That would be the same shtick two times in a row.
[47:54.09]Alright.
[48:04.72]Teleports behind you with some bits.
[48:06.52]Wait, did somebody just say that there was a delay?
[48:08.06]An audio delay?
[48:08.72]Don't tell me it's happening again.
[48:09.89]That would be unfortunate.
[48:12.03]Wiretap the First Baptist Church.
[48:36.81]Break into junction boxes which can be found around the city.
[48:40.51]Wiretapping rackets helps Donovan mark targets of opportunity and collectibles on your map.
[48:45.53]Show enemies an intel view and it allows you to recruit racket bosses.
[48:50.18]Okay.
[48:53.02]Hey, this is a tutorial, dude.
[49:01.12]Don't worry.
[49:01.54]You don't see shit.
[49:02.52]I'm doing a tutorial.
[49:06.64]Wiretapping shows enemies on the mini-map as well as targets of opportunity and collectibles.
[49:10.89]Wiretapping also allows you to move, recruit... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:16.13]Okay, so you can... Wiretap a junction box, you need fuses.
[49:19.79]Alright.
[49:27.08]This guy... I told you, this is the tutorial.
[49:31.34]You don't have to worry.
[49:32.08]I'm gonna make you drop your umbrella.
[49:37.55]I'm not going to hurt you, I'm just going to make you drop the umbrella.
[49:42.50]Told you.
[49:42.92]Yeah, now you're going to walk home in the rain because your AI is too dumb to pick the object that was just in your hand.
[49:49.20]Pick it up.
[49:49.64]Nope, sorry.
[49:52.01]He's like, oh shit, it's raining out.
[49:55.11]If only I had some kind of device to protect my head and body from rain.
[50:00.95]What happened to it?
[50:01.75]Oh, it's so cold too.
[50:03.60]I think I lost my jacket back there as well.
[50:08.48]You know what?
[50:08.86]Fuck this guy.
[50:18.49]Please don't hit me!
[50:23.70]Camera's muted.
[50:25.28]Alright, is there an audio delay?
[50:26.62]Are you ready?
[50:28.88]Ladies and gentlemen, on the count of three, I'm gonna shoot this gun.
[50:31.26]Let me know if the sound comes out like a half second later.
[50:37.50]Anybody?
[50:39.00]Anyone?
[50:43.70]Alright, good.
[50:51.25]I just threw her into the wall.
[50:56.81]No.
[50:57.53]It is late.
[50:58.15]It's fine.
[51:01.50]You didn't count.
[51:02.42]It's alright.
[51:03.92]I don't need to count.
[51:05.00]Sometimes you just hold your breath and just go.
[51:07.88]Like, for instance, this guy's gonna have to hold his breath for a long time.
[51:10.45]Well, it's a lady.
[51:13.09]Well, it is a guy, too.
[51:22.33]No delay?
[51:22.79]Alright, good.
[51:23.59]I'm so paranoid about that now ever since last night.
[51:28.87]I killed that guy like six times.
[51:36.27]No, not this again.
[51:37.17]Not the endless chain of witnesses.
[51:39.67]I can't do this again.
[51:41.63]I'm gonna have to kill the guy in front of him, too.
[51:45.15]No, that guy wasn't a witness.
[51:46.25]The person across the street was.
[51:47.37]He's teleported in front of the car.
[51:51.47]She's no longer a witness.
[51:52.31]Good.
[51:53.37]I scared her.
[51:55.53]That's right.
[51:57.39]You tell your friends.
[52:00.29]Tell your friends that Johnny... Johnny Rocket doesn't take shit.
[52:07.05]Remind anybody.
[52:08.79]You gonna call the cops again?
[52:10.13]You gonna call the cops ever again?
[52:11.31]I didn't think so.
[52:17.08]Let's go.
[52:17.38]Let's actually do a fucking mission.
[52:27.43]I'm so fucking bad at driving.
[52:31.49]What?
[52:35.82]She actually did!
[52:37.00]She actually did call the police!
[52:40.18]Even when it turned out that I was intimidating the witness.
[52:43.10]It's still- Where is she?
[52:44.60]I'm breaking into her fucking house.
[52:47.48]Unbelievable.
[52:49.90]She went this way.
[52:51.66]There were no cell phones back then!
[52:54.48]That doesn't make any sense!
[52:56.61]Is that her?
[53:02.53]Fuck up her chair and shit!
[53:06.70]Yeah, take a look at these moves.
[53:07.58]You wish you had these kind of moves, lady.
[53:09.58]Maybe back when you were younger.
[53:10.58]Yeah, fuck you.
[53:16.14]And fuck you, too.
[53:19.64]What about you?
[53:23.87]That little jab is so fucking stupid.
[53:27.63]Oh, what?
[53:28.37]Oh, God.
[53:29.17]I just wanted to do the little jab.
[53:32.41]I just wanted to do the little jab.
[53:34.19]I punched that guy square in the face.
[53:37.89]Let's get the ice cream truck.
[53:40.17]I'm too distracted.
[53:46.12]I'm too distracted.
[53:46.88]I can't play these games.
[53:48.44]Why is there a cop just in the bush?
[53:52.94]What is he doing in the bush?
[53:56.52]Oh, shit.
[53:57.16]There he is.
[53:57.62]There's the dangerous criminal.
[53:58.80]Go, go, go, go, go.
[54:02.63]Give me out.
[54:02.97]Give me out.
[54:06.33]Cop just sitting in the bush.
[54:08.94]It was a sting.
[54:19.91]God.
[54:23.73]No, no, here they come.
[54:25.85]Yeah.
[54:27.59]Yeah.
[54:30.60]It's not my fault that one of your cop friends is a bush cop.
[54:34.70]Whose car exploded?
[54:38.86]What?
[54:40.74]Why is there a... I hit him.
[54:44.14]Thank you.
[54:44.74]Wager.
[54:45.74]Wager.
[54:46.26]Thank you.
[54:48.64]Informant is escaping.
[54:50.44]Hold on.
[54:52.26]This is an informant?
[54:55.52]I have to enter... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[55:00.69]No, no, no, no, no.
[55:01.35]You guys don't understand.
[55:02.15]This is the bad guy.
[55:03.81]This is the bad guy.
[55:07.19]This is the bad guy.
[55:08.23]No, you guys don't understand.
[55:10.89]Look at his pants.
[55:21.26]All units, search is called off.
[55:30.14]Repeat abandoned search.
[55:31.96]Return to patrol.
[55:48.05]That's fucking so funny.
[55:54.45]Ugh, my fucking stomach.
[55:57.37]Ugh.
[56:00.82]I don't even know what the fuck was happening right there.
[56:02.82]I just teleported into this person.
[56:11.84]He just gets out of the car.
[56:16.34]Ugh.
[56:18.78]Alright, where is he?
[56:20.64]Where is he?
[56:21.08]Interrogate him.
[56:25.92]Alright, interrogate the informant.
[56:28.90]I want to drive recklessly in a car.
[56:31.32]Okay, I'm going to use this device.
[56:38.12]Okay, this thing.
[56:39.70]How do I get into it?
[56:40.66]Z?
[56:42.22]This thing.
[56:42.68]Okay, here we go.
[56:45.04]No, I didn't want to call the guy.
[56:46.36]I wanted to throw the screaming Zemi.
[56:51.97]So they get scared at this?
[56:53.61]That didn't do anything.
[57:01.15]He just came out here and was looking.
[57:14.20]I just creeped a second in front of him.
[57:17.34]My stomach still hurts, by the way.
[57:18.61]Alright, get it.
[57:22.19]I want to do the thing with the car again.
[57:25.95]This guy's had like five opportunities to shoot the absolute shit out of me and he didn't.
[57:32.55]A witness calling the police.
[57:33.68]I'm interrogating him in the middle of the road.
[57:35.60]Recruit him?
[57:36.12]Hold on, I can recruit this guy for a thousand dollars?
[57:39.38]Oh no, I get a thousand dollars if I... I didn't do that.
[57:42.56]I just turned that guy's face into a fucking horror movie scarecrow.
[58:02.31]Ugh.
[58:04.51]How is this person dead?
[58:08.61]Okay, that guy was dead in the car before I got here.
[58:10.27]I can't.
[58:11.77]I can't.
[58:12.09]I seriously can't.
[58:13.37]I can't.
[58:13.75]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[58:31.86]All I have to do is just get over here.
[58:33.24]I can just get over here.
[58:35.96]I gotta get to the mission area.
[58:39.68]No!
[58:41.92]Covert approach?
[58:42.86]What the fuck are you talking about?
[58:46.86]Using a covert approach, you can quietly slip past enemies.
[58:50.42]Before going into combat, use intel to scope out enemies' points of interest.
[58:56.31]Okay.
[59:00.62]I'm doing it covertly.
[59:09.27]Covert.
[59:12.91]Covert operation.
[59:17.47]Why do they know where I am?
[59:33.72]Yeah, I need a second to, like, recuperate after that.
[59:35.76]That was fucking crazy.
[59:39.14]That whole scenario that played out right there just almost killed me.
[59:44.04]Anyways, thank you, Wager, for the 10,000, man, for the 100 bucks.
[59:51.48]That's very kind of you guys.
[59:53.14]Fucking thanks.
[59:54.24]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[59:55.64]Thank you, thank you, thank you!
[60:03.93]Okay, fine.
[60:05.70]What?
[60:07.28]No, no, I thought we... Holy shit, this guy is a maniac.
[60:13.36]I shot him right in the leg.
[60:16.66]I... I'm serious right now.
[60:22.08]Okay.
[60:24.09]That guy was so determined to not flinch.
[60:27.43]That guy was on a bunch of drugs.
[60:32.18]Oh my god.
[60:32.94]It starts all over again.
[60:33.88]I'm just going to hang over here.
[60:39.31]I'm just going in here.
[60:39.97]I don't even know where this is.
[60:45.29]Anyways.
[60:46.77]Thanks to Wager.
[60:47.63]Thanks to OQ Dom for the two months.
[60:50.94]Thanks Equinoxy.
[60:52.40]Hexbread.
[60:52.94]I think I missed another one or two.
[61:03.98]I think I actually have to be in here.
[61:08.58]Yeah, I do.
[61:10.14]I found the right place to go.
[61:16.28]You want money?
[61:16.74]I got most of it, right?
[61:21.52]Ooh, new weapon.
[61:21.96]What is this?
[61:24.34]It's an Alfred Center.
[61:25.44]Remember when Alfred in the Batman movies used this gun?
[61:29.69]I do.
[61:31.43]It's a great weapon of choice.
[61:36.43]I wasn't even a bird.
[61:42.95]You thought I was a bird.
[61:45.11]I watched a shitty airline commercial 70 times for this.
[61:59.00]I watched a shitty airline commercial three times.
[62:07.05]Oh, you are slaying me right now, dude.
[62:11.65]How did you even get in here?
[62:15.51]What is with these fucking magic police?
[62:20.43]Ugh.
[62:21.19]Could you make a 30 second ad?
[62:22.53]Oh, god damn it.
[62:23.55]Get out of here.
[62:24.23]I'm trying to talk to somebody in the chat.
[62:31.28]Could you make a 30-second ad for a seafood restaurant?
[62:33.30]Can you guess what I want it to be called?
[62:36.46]Everybody has fucking fire, too.
[62:43.79]Huh?
[62:50.01]Where?
[62:50.41]Oh, they think I'm dead.
[62:51.05]Okay.
[62:58.62]Yeah, they... Okay, so they think... Do you think I'm dead?
[63:00.92]Oh, I'll check on him.
[63:02.90]Let's see.
[63:03.70]I'm too stupid!
[63:05.72]Wow, that was such a fucking huge, massive failure.
[63:17.57]Fuck.
[63:24.88]What a catastrophic failure.
[63:28.64]Yeah, throw fire in the room.
[63:34.36]What are you guys talking about?
[63:37.49]This guy's in my face.
[63:39.73]I'm not even doing that.
[63:50.37]She's doing that.
[63:54.75]Damn it.
[63:55.23]I didn't even fucking want to do that.
[63:59.03]Now she's gonna puke.
[64:01.15]She's doing the thing my cat does when it's about to throw up.
[64:08.90]Here comes a hair fall.
[64:16.72]I don't know why that's so funny to me right now.
[64:21.09]Okay, you know when a cat... You know when a cat is like...
[64:33.44]That lady is about to do a cat puke.
[64:35.61]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[64:38.81]Come on, give me the ice cream truck.
[64:53.68]Oh, god damn it.
[64:54.82]I'm just going to get out of this area.
[64:56.92]I'm not going to fuck this up again.
[65:06.38]Get me out of this stupid area.
[65:07.56]The cats don't live here.
[65:14.21]When I used to live in my old place, there were two cats.
[65:18.39]Okay.
[65:23.69]I'm going to hang out right here for a minute.
[65:28.40]Female Jesus, thanks for the eight months.
[65:32.92]Welcome back.
[65:35.67]Are we good?
[65:36.45]I think we're good.
[65:47.06]No, this is an ice cream truck.
[65:52.68]Yeah, no cat cam.
[65:58.63]Fuck!
[65:59.29]I stopped at the red.
[66:00.05]I stopped at the red light.
[66:01.43]I'm here.
[66:01.71]I stopped.
[66:05.82]Gotta wait till it's green.
[66:11.34]I fixed it, see?
[66:12.76]Nothing to be mad about.
[66:16.44]Everything's fine.
[66:19.47]Imagine doing that in real life.
[66:22.39]You are getting that ticket.
[66:24.23]I just cut off a cop.
[66:27.65]Yeah, don't cut the cop off either, by the way.
[66:35.10]Holy shit, that's not only tickets, I'm like going, I'm getting my license taken away.
[66:47.41]Okay.
[66:48.97]Nice and easy.
[66:52.49]There's a bunch of shit over here.
[66:53.62]There's like body armor and... There's a guy right there.
[67:00.69]Get to the next of the box.
[67:02.73]Sneak over this way.
[67:04.99]Sneak over here.
[67:13.07]Shit.
[67:20.80]Moron.
[67:25.18]What a fucking moron.
[67:28.92]Need a health.
[67:33.89]The body armor.
[67:37.78]Ooh, nice.
[67:38.86]That is not only body armor, that's like an Iron Man chest.
[67:43.82]Definitely.
[67:44.24]Do I need to put it on, or is it already on?
[67:51.33]I got ammo for all my guns.
[67:54.53]Speaking of ammo, I'll just take this.
[67:59.01]I'll lose a sniper rifle, though.
[68:01.65]Get rid of the shitty pistol.
[68:04.71]Okay, it's a slot.
[68:05.61]Never mind.
[68:10.18]Give me that money.
[68:13.64]Ready to go.
[68:15.36]Let's go take this place over, right?
[68:16.96]I gotta go take it over.
[68:17.68]Destroy Charlie's heroin.
[68:19.72]Uh-oh.
[68:23.02]Charlie's got some friends over there.
[68:33.04]You know when a game's framerate is like dog shit and it's actually hard to aim?
[68:42.14]That's what's happening.
[68:43.16]I'm going to use that as an excuse.
[68:46.70]Thanks a lot, PeterG.
[68:47.48]Welcome.
[68:47.84]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[68:50.51]Thanks for subbing to the channel.
[68:51.51]Welcome, dude.
[68:52.03]Welcome to this fucking channel.
[69:04.24]This is like 22 frames a second.
[69:08.42]What is with the fire bombs?
[69:09.90]See, I can do that too.
[69:11.50]So the difference is I'm not an idiot.
[69:13.63]What was that?
[69:14.07]Oh, it was these guys.
[69:27.46]Guys, I got a little word of advice for you.
[69:29.30]If you're an evil henchman and you're coming from behind, don't beep a hundred times to let me know that you're right behind me.
[69:36.20]That's probably not the smartest thing you could do.
[69:37.76]Alright guys, we just showed up to reinforce our friends.
[69:44.02]Hold the horn down at the guy that's currently shooting.
[69:46.20]I need ammo.
[69:57.25]Six bullets.
[70:04.42]Who's throwing a Molotov?
[70:08.28]What a perfect throw.
[70:09.20]Yeah, right.
[70:09.80]No one can do that.
[70:14.36]They want it to be fair.
[70:15.42]Alright, I'm out of ammo.
[70:17.78]I think I got him.
[70:28.56]Pick up this shit.
[70:32.71]How do you not have any bolts either?
[70:33.83]Is this guy underground?
[70:39.01]What is this?
[70:39.61]Oh, I think that's... I'm not entirely sure if that was a bad guy or not, but he was in the way.
[70:49.45]He was not red, he was gray.
[70:51.63]Alright, we're in the...
[71:04.46]Do I have to tap his ley line?
[71:11.09]Full health.
[71:14.69]Did I miss the money?
[71:15.77]Always pick up the money.
[71:23.13]Don't worry about me.
[71:25.76]Just gonna rip open your front door.
[71:31.30]Oh my god.
[71:34.79]Oh my god.
[71:35.91]What the fuck is this room?
[71:41.31]You don't need to get that close.
[71:51.97]Pick up the bits.
[71:52.71]Yeah, everyone just get out of here.
[71:56.13]Go, go, go, go, go.
[71:57.11]You're free.
[71:57.55]You're all free.
[72:02.75]Targets?
[72:04.15]Look at the ground.
[72:04.93]Yeah, these are the opportunity targets.
[72:11.81]Alright, we gotta look at the air.
[72:14.53]We have to find the thing.
[72:17.43]I think this is the thing I need to get rid of.
[72:21.67]Yep.
[72:22.55]Okay, what other thing are we not looking at?
[72:28.79]You didn't see anything?
[72:30.79]Don't worry.
[72:33.92]There's a couple more.
[72:35.32]I think the room is empty at this point.
[72:37.96]I did a preemptive look at the ceiling.
[72:45.42]What the hell is this?
[72:52.75]Smash it.
[73:00.73]Interrogate somebody?
[73:05.30]Somebody's still here?
[73:13.19]I guess I did it.
[73:13.75]Does that just have to run around and get more money?
[73:22.43]Break open the safety.
[73:23.43]Oh, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns.
[73:26.59]Ammo.
[73:31.91]I want this.
[73:36.24]What the hell is that?
[73:38.28]I think that might be a naked lady.
[73:39.80]I don't think I want to do that.
[73:46.15]Remember, naked lady alarm?
[73:47.43]I have to, like, fucking blur the screen.
[73:49.59]I need a car.
[73:51.25]Next!
[74:05.01]Who's talking?
[74:06.03]I keep hearing somebody screaming.
[74:15.02]I can't... I'm so bad at driving these cars.
[74:17.20]I swear... Am I hearing things, guys?
[74:24.61]Or do I keep hearing people yelling and screaming?
[74:29.51]Oh my god.
[74:30.33]All those naked ladies are just out here.
[74:33.82]In random parts.
[74:34.64]Like, go to the hospital.
[74:36.47]Go to the police.
[74:39.93]Get out of here.
[74:42.49]She was waiting for the walk signal.
[74:44.77]No!
[74:51.00]What?
[74:52.34]She's waiting for the walk signal again.
[74:57.00]If I just escaped, I wouldn't wait for walk signals.
[75:01.21]She's crossing the street very legally here.
[75:06.64]I'm very curious now.
[75:10.36]Yep.
[75:11.00]Wait for the walk.
[75:11.75]We got a red light here.
[75:13.71]Okay.
[75:14.21]Pedestrians can now walk.
[75:16.59]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[75:22.55]This is like... This is not good.
[75:28.02]Now where are you going?
[75:32.60]Can I like pick her up and drive her to the hospital?
[75:39.29]She just waved.
[75:40.07]Lady just waved.
[75:40.63]That lady just waved at her.
[75:43.23]She waved at her.
[75:50.56]I am fascinated.
[75:59.36]Everything's normal, don't worry.
[76:08.42]My frame rate is so awful right now.
[76:11.96]Let's see, let's see.
[76:13.50]What's the interaction here?
[76:16.49]No, that guy didn't want to say hello.
[76:19.37]She waved.
[76:23.13]She was going... Oh, this is... Hold on.
[76:25.61]This is important.
[76:28.89]People are just waving at her.
[76:32.21]This is not right.
[76:34.61]Look at how fucked up this is.
[76:36.67]She's sprinting scared.
[76:38.43]Well, she didn't get waved to there.
[76:47.62]Half the people she goes by is happy to see her.
[76:51.14]You know, that lady wasn't happy.
[76:58.97]I want someone else to wave at her.
[77:02.52]Now she's looking at me.
[77:03.18]I'm trying to help you.
[77:12.37]Big crowd coming.
[77:13.01]Big crowd.
[77:13.37]Big crowd.
[77:13.73]Big crowd.
[77:18.53]Hi.
[77:18.91]What is her end goal?
[77:22.34]I wonder what the end goal is.
[77:31.05]There has to be some kind of conclusion to this story, right?
[77:36.45]God, I'm so far away.
[77:40.62]From where I need to be.
[77:45.16]I told you, I'm like Lakitu.
[77:46.46]I'm the guy with the camera in Mario.
[77:51.42]I'm a journalist.
[77:52.16]I just follow developments.
[77:54.42]And I also take this car.
[77:57.04]Because look at this thing.
[77:58.08]It's a cool Jeep.
[78:02.75]I think there's a fight.
[78:05.07]No.
[78:06.25]We almost saw a fight.
[78:12.37]We got two people running down the street.
[78:16.96]I don't know why I'm this fascinated.
[78:18.42]I gotta go.
[78:19.48]I have to get out of here.
[78:23.70]Get out of the way.
[78:24.46]Get on the fucking right side of the road.
[78:26.02]I'm on the wrong side of the road.
[78:28.15]I'm on the complete wrong side.
[78:29.37]Did somebody just scream, get some?
[78:35.77]I can't stop.
[78:36.69]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[78:39.01]And now I'm trespassing apparently.
[78:40.47]Alright, it's enough.
[78:42.21]She's not going anywhere.
[78:43.11]She's running in circles.
[78:48.50]How do I beep?
[78:50.88]What's the horn?
[79:01.56]Bye.
[79:02.14]It was nice knowing you.
[79:03.46]Take care of yourself.
[79:08.27]Sweet ride, though.
[79:09.16]Sweet Jeep.
[79:12.08]As I fucking destroy it.
[79:13.18]That lady had a huge ice cream cone.
[79:24.35]Almost there.
[79:25.07]And now I gotta get... Interrogate this guy.
[79:30.71]This whole place is gonna come down.
[79:34.42]Wait, hold on.
[79:34.96]I need... I need my arms dealer.
[79:38.04]I want some grenades and shit.
[79:39.04]Is that a roller coaster?
[79:41.06]Have to ride that.
[79:43.42]No!
[79:43.90]My conclusion!
[79:52.22]Hello.
[79:55.81]Uh, yes.
[79:56.33]I'd like to buy some stuff.
[80:01.48]Cocktail, screaming, zimmie, FRAG grenade, I don't have it unlocked.
[80:09.37]Spend my money, why not?
[80:14.19]Alright.
[80:15.31]See ya.
[80:16.73]You gotta be fucking kidding me, dude.
[80:22.33]Like, you don't see me just... How do you not see me going across the street?
[80:26.46]Did that do any damage?
[80:31.34]What is that drink?
[80:34.62]That is a crazy drink.
[80:35.72]I want to know what it is.
[80:36.48]It's blinking almost like I can drink it.
[80:40.50]It's a mellow yellow.
[80:42.28]Or it's a Mountain Dew.
[80:47.68]Excuse me?
[80:48.18]I'm going to shoot this motherfucker right now.
[80:50.28]If it doesn't drop that drink.
[80:51.18]No, I'm not going to.
[80:52.00]What do you guys think I am?
[80:52.84]A crazy person?
[80:56.56]Surge.
[80:57.08]Alright, so here we go.
[80:59.91]This is the bad guy zone.
[81:02.53]We're just torching this whole bar.
[81:03.81]Alright, so let me pull up my grenades.
[81:12.48]This whole place is going down.
[81:13.64]Alright, perfect spot.
[81:23.15]There they are.
[81:27.99]Right... Where are the most bad guys?
[81:32.81]This is like where they sell all the drugs and shit.
[81:34.89]Right here, right?
[81:37.02]Right on the drum set?
[81:37.76]Right on this sacred drum set?
[81:43.06]Right in there.
[81:46.22]I almost just threw up.
[81:50.55]Got him!
[81:59.43]Got him.
[82:03.42]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[82:05.34]There he is.
[82:05.70]I gotta interrogate him.
[82:09.36]Don't you go anywhere.
[82:14.16]Interrogate.
[82:14.66]There we go.
[82:15.52]This way I get to drive crazy.
[82:17.60]No, you're gonna tell me or I'm gonna kill your chef.
[82:28.39]I'm going to drive crazy.
[82:29.23]I'm going to turn up the crazy here, guys.
[82:33.99]What?
[82:35.05]Get back in here.
[82:36.51]Get in the car.
[82:38.50]Oh, you fuckface.
[82:41.04]Unbelievable.
[82:43.02]No.
[82:50.42]I wasn't going fast enough.
[82:53.22]I wasn't going fast enough.
[82:56.29]I'll get him this time.
[83:12.47]Thank you OmZNomZ for his subscription.
[83:16.26]Killacrock with 1500 bits.
[83:17.48]Thanks a lot, dude.
[83:18.10]And he says, it's fine to have naked boobs and such on screen as long as it isn't the focus according to the Twitch terms of service.
[83:25.85]Showed some Playboy magazines unless you're worried about YouTube or something.
[83:28.87]That actually is probably much more of a concern for me.
[83:32.43]These are when it gets cut up for stream highlights.
[83:39.36]But yeah, thanks a lot.
[83:40.82]That's 15 bucks, dude.
[83:41.82]Appreciate it.
[83:42.32]And Peter G. Did I get Peter G?
[83:44.21]Did I say hi to Peter G?
[83:45.25]Probably not.
[83:45.85]So hi, Peter G. Thanks for something.
[83:54.29]You get back here and continue with this interrogation, young man.
[83:59.29]I'm just gonna full-on barrel run directly into everybody.
[84:02.51]I don't even care anymore.
[84:03.79]Fuck your groceries.
[84:05.17]Fuck your bagel.
[84:05.88]What is that?
[84:06.92]They always have these, like, Subway sandwiches.
[84:12.25]That thing looks good.
[84:15.15]Can anybody see what's on it?
[84:16.07]Is that a tuna melt?
[84:18.77]A lot of condiments on that, man.
[84:21.25]I see one huge slab of tomato.
[84:24.41]Pickles.
[84:25.06]Is that like a condiment sandwich?
[84:28.14]All I see is lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and pickles.
[84:32.52]Your sandwich sucks.
[84:34.60]That's some fucking meat in there.
[84:42.07]You got two Jupiters in chat.
[84:50.37]There are so many people here.
[84:56.22]Can I sit in the... Oh, it's a barbecue.
[84:57.66]Can I have some food?
[85:02.74]Where's the next guy with a sandwich?
[85:08.99]They were vegetarian.
[85:09.97]Oh, shit.
[85:10.59]Yeah, that's true.
[85:11.59]Well...
[85:14.38]Why would you eat a lettuce sandwich?
[85:17.94]Don't vegetarians put mushrooms in their sandwiches?
[85:21.21]Or tofu or something?
[85:23.39]Come on.
[85:24.07]Who?
[85:27.39]It's always the one crazy guy.
[85:35.42]I seriously don't want to keep doing this.
[85:37.36]He's still going to go for the phone, isn't he?
[85:41.34]He's going for the phone still.
[85:46.16]I don't think he's gonna make it.
[85:50.67]How long do you think before he gives up on calling the police on me?
[85:56.05]Oh shit, I think the phone's around here somewhere.
[85:59.16]Where's that phone?
[86:02.06]Fuck.
[86:08.68]I wanna help him.
[86:17.15]He eventually pushed through the plywood.
[86:19.91]Can I, like, get him in his way so he can't answer the phone?
[86:25.98]He didn't make any phone call.
[86:26.98]That guy did not talk.
[86:28.04]He didn't say a goddamn word.
[86:30.98]He didn't say a goddamn word.
[86:44.90]Okay, somebody just wrote in the chat, you're a very sick person.
[86:50.95]No, I just pretend to be one on TV.
[86:55.11]I'm not a doctor, I just pretend to be one on TV.
[87:00.20]What is that from?
[87:04.50]That's gonna drive me crazy now.
[87:06.82]No, I'm not a doctor, but I pretend to be one on TV.
[87:13.19]You are a very sick person.
[87:22.53]And come on, call off the search.
[87:27.01]Hi, I'm on TV.
[87:30.03]Simpsons, maybe.
[87:33.09]They're still looking for me.
[87:37.16]Don't come down this road.
[87:38.30]Don't come down this road.
[87:39.26]Thank God.
[87:39.70]Alright, let's go.
[87:48.20]Don't pull me over.
[87:54.98]Something about running red lights in all these games.
[87:58.98]It's the sweet life of Zack and Cody.
[88:00.82]That's not true.
[88:05.76]In fact, that might be the farthest from the truth.
[88:10.58]Okay, let's do this again.
[88:11.44]Is this guy a bad guy?
[88:14.74]I mean, he's sitting out here.
[88:16.85]He has to be a bad guy, right?
[88:20.89]He's putting his fist up.
[88:23.70]No, I think he was just a drunk guy that was sitting down.
[88:25.60]That's okay.
[88:27.69]I'll leave him alone.
[88:38.87]Loitering.

[101:07.00]Okay.
[101:12.46]What happened?
[101:12.84]What did I miss?
[101:14.34]Recruit bosses.
[101:19.86]Oh, okay.
[101:20.32]That's the option I have between killing them or making them work for me.
[101:28.58]Just set me right in front of here, didn't it?
[101:30.06]Okay.
[101:38.19]Confront Charlie.
[101:45.01]My pee was louder than the AC in the building.
[101:47.17]What?
[101:47.65]What?
[101:54.00]Not true.
[101:55.32]I don't believe it for a second.
[102:02.76]Um... I'm just vandalizing the guy's house.
[102:28.39]I'm just being spooky outside of his window.
[102:33.13]Wait, he's coming out here.
[102:37.26]He's actually coming out here?
[102:38.18]Let me throw another one.
[102:46.42]Am I throwing birds at the window?
[102:51.77]Let me do you a favor.
[102:55.01]Let me throw a bird at the window.
[103:00.30]That makes it funnier for some reason.
[103:01.70]It's like a bird.
[103:02.52]That didn't do anything.
[103:04.69]I just wasted like 400 bucks.
[103:06.35]I wish I had a battle axe.
[103:13.29]Swing it in there.
[103:14.73]Or take the guy's fucking head off.
[103:16.80]Holy shit, he is right here.
[103:24.90]No trace of him.
[103:28.85]This is such a bad hiding spot.
[103:30.41]Why is this working?
[103:37.15]What?
[103:40.98]Give me a break.
[103:47.18]I'm so glad these guys don't understand trees.
[103:51.29]No, he does now.
[103:51.97]He does.
[104:04.03]Got him.
[104:10.89]So many people just showed up.
[104:12.55]My word.
[104:18.41]Nice dramatic TV show death.
[104:32.04]How many people?
[104:33.36]There's so many of them.
[104:37.81]Almost out of bullets.
[104:41.33]Oh, see you later.
[104:42.01]I'm dead.
[104:50.82]I didn't expect them all to freak the fuck out.
[104:54.04]I'm hiding in a bush and they moved my shoulder so they all screamed.
[105:01.45]Feed him my breast milk?
[105:02.91]What?
[105:07.05]Take it on on that guy.
[105:14.37]Have I ever played The Witness?
[105:16.43]I have not.
[105:23.84]Why am I not watching the Celtics?
[105:26.34]I don't know.
[105:26.72]I don't really watch basketball.
[105:29.18]I don't really care for it.

[108:13.11]Let's say you're riding your bike with a friend.
[108:15.19]Hold on, I gotta shoot this guy in the face.
[108:16.43]Or I'll just miss.
[108:18.82]Alright, you know when you're riding bikes with a friend, or you're trying to do something really dumb with your buddies?
[108:26.39]Oh, it's, uh, we're gonna roll down a cliff in a tire.

[108:31.17]That's a bad example.
[108:31.97]But, alright.
[108:33.01]So you roll down the tire.
[108:34.85]They had a big hill in the backyard.
[108:36.57]You go down the hill with your buddy and you're in the tire.

[108:40.47]You're both rolling and rolling and rolling.
[108:42.09]Boom!
[108:42.75]Tire lands on the ground.
[108:43.53]Both of you guys fall out.
[108:45.31]You are fucking fine.
[108:46.83]You feel fine.
[108:48.41]There's nothing wrong with you at all.
[108:50.39]But your friend is seriously fucking hurt.
[108:54.07]So, what you do is, while he's freaking out on the ground about like he has a broken leg, you sit there and you go, Oh, my neck!
[109:03.14]My neck!
[109:03.70]You're fine.
[109:04.06]You're completely fine.
[109:05.36]Oh, my neck is fucked up, dude.

[114:31.49]Alright, time to talk to Cassandra.
[114:41.09]Don't lose your umbrella.
[114:41.97]She still wants to call the police.
[114:49.94]Can I punch her face out the window?
[114:57.30]No, I can't.
[114:58.40]Someone else is going to call the cops now.
[115:05.45]See, I knew it.
[115:06.23]This is exactly what I was talking about.
[115:07.55]I knew this was going to happen.
[115:08.37]It's just a chain reaction.
[115:11.35]Just back the fuck up and outrun the cops.
[115:13.73]It's not even worth it.
[115:15.73]Just get out.
[115:17.57]Even if they do call the police, who cares?
[115:18.97]What are they gonna do?
[115:20.54]I'm gonna be out of the circle.
[115:25.24]Already out of the circle.
[115:27.58]No harm.
[115:29.24]I'm fine.
[115:32.76]Talk to Cassandra.
[115:33.82]There's no reason for me to dive out of that car.
[115:43.46]Cutscene.
[115:43.91]The hell's that?
[115:50.08]I thought that was me for a second.
[115:52.80]I was like, wait, that's not my character?
[115:55.87]This man's name is Jesse.
[115:58.50]We were just having ourselves a little conversation about Richie Ducey.
[116:03.42]Listen, I ain't done nothing, you hear?
[116:06.08]I don't know anything.
[116:07.68]I was just taking a walk and walking down the street and she grabbed me is all.
[116:11.84]You a Dixie Mafia?
[116:12.94]No.
[116:13.88]Yes.
[116:14.51]I mean, shit.
[116:17.11]I did it for the money, you hear?
[116:18.85]It's Jerma.
[116:19.39]That looks like me.
[116:20.29]Hold on a second.
[116:21.19]I don't even carry a gun.
[116:22.37]Where's Ducet?
[116:26.62]I can't do it.
[116:27.04]I can't.
[116:27.55]What the hell is he doing out there?
[116:30.97]From what I heard.
[116:31.61]It's me.
[116:32.61]That's my face.
[116:34.13]Georgie.
[116:34.83]Georgie's on a goddamn warpath.
[116:37.01]He wants Richie dead.
[116:38.77]So Richie, he grabbed what was left of the heroin and took off.
[116:42.56]Said he was gonna lay low until he could settle things with Georgie.
[116:45.92]How many men he got with him?
[116:47.18]Hell, I don't know.
[116:48.32]All of them.
[116:52.24]This game for proof
[117:17.67]I was going to do a side-by-side there, but I'm not fat enough.
[117:25.87]That guy had a pretty fat face.
[117:28.19]My face isn't that fat.
[117:29.87]I kind of look like that guy, but with a fatter face.
[117:36.22]Kill Richie Doucette.
[117:40.64]Okay.
[117:42.36]I guess I will.
[117:50.13]We're going there the whole way backwards.
[117:55.60]It's an open world game.
[117:56.58]Why not, right?
[117:58.34]You do whatever the fuck you want.
[117:59.94]Whatever the heck you want in an open world game.
[118:06.89]God, how many times have you wished you could do this in real life?
[118:08.81]Just go backwards to like we're driving down the street.
[118:12.89]You can do it here.
[118:14.25]It's video games.
[118:17.35]Video games.
[118:18.11]You can do whatever you want.
[118:20.29]You can do whatever you feel like.
[118:28.35]Made it.
[118:30.93]I wish I could just jump out of the car and ghost ride it down the sidewalk.
[118:33.87]Actually, I don't wish I could do that.
[118:38.51]What is going on over here?
[118:39.41]This is hurting my eyes.
[118:40.25]Ow.
[118:48.03]This is the roller coaster scene.
[118:54.05]Nice.
[118:55.23]I'm so glad we get to do this.
[118:59.87]He didn't even climb the ladder.
[119:01.05]He just jumped like Superman.
[119:05.04]That's not how you climb a ladder.
[119:06.02]You don't climb ladders like that.
[119:10.84]You got off that full ladder in less than one second.
[119:16.53]What the... Okay.
[119:20.64]I just want to do sneak.
[119:22.12]I just want to sneak up on these guys.
[119:24.48]Yeah, okay.

[120:34.51]Can they get burned by the fire?
[120:39.00]These knife kills are so brutal.
[120:42.78]They are so insane.
[120:47.98]Sorry, buddy.
[120:49.96]Maybe next time.
[121:06.61]Very long death sound.

[121:15.54]Quick, use this tiny little ashtray.
[121:19.75]Use the ashtray for cover.

[121:33.55]Blind.
[121:37.03]I'm wasting ammo.
[121:37.67]Don't do that.
[121:38.45]That's a terrible idea.
[121:41.05]I'm just gonna throw a Molotov.
[121:45.09]They always throw Molotovs.
[121:49.01]Switch out?
[121:53.28]Should I?

[133:03.17]I made him disappear.
[133:05.79]For my next trick.
[133:14.99]Alright, well, that was dumb.
[133:20.81]Same guy.
[133:21.49]You think you can come in here and steal my heroin without nobody noticing?
[133:27.73]I'm not here to steal your heroin, Richie.
[133:30.13]I'm here to make you pay for what you did to Sammy and Ellis Robinson.
[133:33.43]Content skipper.
[133:37.63]I watched you stab Ellis in the gut.
[133:40.91]I couldn't do nothing about it then, but I sure as hell can now.
[133:44.50]The hell am I gonna do to this guy?
[133:46.74]This guy... You can pray on the way up.
[134:19.35]Jeez.
[134:26.75]I'm gonna be real with you guys.
[134:28.73]I feel like I could get out of that.
[134:30.67]I feel like I could just reach up and pull myself up.
[134:32.89]That wasn't a very long rope.
[134:34.85]Nothing like this had ever happened before.
[134:37.25]I feel like I could have just kind of reached up and done it.
[134:39.89]Generally, a small contained event.
[134:43.17]Some greaseball is eating spaghetti and meatballs at his favorite restaurant gets popped in the head.
[134:49.53]but this was different.
[134:52.38]Even then, even before I knew who killed him, I knew that Richie had been put on display.
[134:58.48]Lincoln was trained in psychological warfare by the CIA.
[135:03.28]He wanted to terrify the mob, wanted them to know he was gonna kill every last one of them.
[135:08.94]And none of them would be able to stop him.
[135:24.61]You've got to do a single pull-up.
[135:27.75]When you can't do a single pull-up, that would be terrible.
[135:32.07]Let's do some boat action here.
[135:34.80]Let's get in the boat.
[135:35.54]Boat action.
[135:37.14]Fly away.
[135:45.67]Looks like this next mission needs a little help from Detective Church.
[135:55.76]What's the fastest way over there?
[135:57.22]I guess I could just get out of the boat and run, right?
[136:00.40]Oh, the roller coaster, the roller coaster, right.
[136:02.00]I can ride the roller coaster?
[136:05.25]Ah, shit, I'm too far.
[136:06.27]I'm too far away.
[136:06.93]I give up.
[136:11.65]I'm tight, I'm tight, give up.
[136:19.69]These boats suck.
[136:21.51]There's no reason to have boats in this game.
[136:26.53]What an utter disappointment.
[136:27.71]There's no water It's like 30,000 feet of water.
[136:31.55]That's a lot of water.
[136:32.49]There's like less than a mile of water How many feet is a mile?
[136:37.02]5,645?
[136:37.04]What are you doing?
[136:37.52]Also, by the way
[136:51.12]Thank you, Warvoid, for six months.
[136:53.44]It wasn't a very good hangout after all.
[136:54.85]Thank you, Pipsteer, for the new sub.
[136:57.17]StokedGamer for four months.
[136:58.35]TotalDrive.
[136:59.67]GamerTheGreat for subscriptions.
[137:04.41]Saltair777, thanks for two months.
[137:06.08]Ride the coaster.
[137:06.76]Maybe I will eventually.
[137:09.30]Maybe I will eventually.
[137:14.21]Thanks, Hitachi.
[137:16.81]And also to Kizubel for 100 bits.
[137:21.34]And a couple other guys gave some bits, too.
[137:22.68]Thank you, Sambo Haxor.
[137:25.68]And Kip the Argonian.
[137:29.26]And then BYZB, Bibsy, Busy.
[137:34.27]And who could forget Sir Temus?
[137:39.45]Who could forget?
[137:41.64]AKA right now.
[137:43.76]It's so far away and the dumb useless boats make no sense.
[137:46.64]I gotta go talk to Cassandra first.
[137:52.41]What is wrong with my guy?
[137:57.03]Can I not swim in this game?
[137:57.99]I guess I can.
[138:06.38]Up on the dock.
[138:07.10]Get up there!
[138:15.79]Rewind to the roller coaster.
[138:18.09]We gotta do our next mission.
[138:20.03]I need more money.
[138:20.63]If I'm gonna run the whole mafia.
[138:27.14]Alright, where is it?
[138:32.46]Over here somewhere?
[138:33.90]Who knows.
[138:39.72]Getting hit by cars in this game doesn't seem to do very much damage to you.
[138:55.65]Hi, Cassandra.
[138:56.87]Please give me a cutscene.
[138:57.87]Let me just break all your shit first.
[139:03.57]Not a big deal.
[139:12.23]Doucette's dead.
[139:13.89]The hollow's yours.
[139:15.87]They say you strung him up on the old Ferris wheel.
[139:19.60]I did.
[139:19.92]You killed Ellis.
[139:21.40]You shit all over the people in this neighborhood.
[139:23.20]Doucette got what he deserved.
[139:26.25]You know what the realest thing about all these people?
[139:29.28]The teeth.
[139:33.26]Look at their teeth.
[139:36.10]All these people.
[139:36.64]Look at their teeth.
[139:39.04]They're so real looking.
[139:42.05]They have the realest teeth of any cutscenes I've ever seen in a game.
[139:52.54]New emote and sub badges are coming within the next two weeks, I would assume.
[139:58.04]Maybe a few weeks.
[140:02.42]And if you would have helped my man, Emmanuel, that's a gesture that would go a long way in calming nerves.
[140:09.90]What's he need?
[140:12.26]Main character's teeth.
[140:13.30]I want him to do a big smile so you can see what I'm talking about.
[140:16.11]Help him, and I'll see to it you get a potion of the prophets.
[140:20.29]Just so we're clear, I'm expecting a cut of everything, not just what comes from selling weed.
[140:25.19]It's gonna cost a lot of money to take down Marconi.
[140:27.27]Don't worry.
[140:29.07]I'll make sure you get your money.
[140:42.32]They all go to the same dentist?
[140:43.56]Alright, you're about to sign this district to Cassandra.
[140:53.11]Okay.
[140:55.15]Did I just get $62,000?
[140:56.57]No, I didn't.
[141:03.62]Whose money is that then?
[141:06.40]Excuse me, I'll take the envelope.
[141:07.66]It was $360.
[141:08.14]We're running all these rackets and all I get is an envelope with $360 in it?
[141:24.11]You shitting me?
[141:26.01]I've killed like 60 people.
[141:30.89]Thanks for the mail.
[141:39.54]Oh no!
[141:39.90]A witness is calling the police!
[141:41.44]Stop them!
[141:44.48]What am I gonna fucking do?
[141:45.72]There's no bullets in this gun.
[141:50.38]I'm gonna drive away.
[141:57.76]You earned it, pal.
[141:59.78]You did it.
[142:05.39]Uh, adjust for inflation.
[142:06.59]Yeah, even with inflation.
[142:09.69]$360 with inflation.
[142:11.15]That's not even like a thousand.
[142:12.27]That's like... Actually, that might be like $3,000.
[142:14.20]Thanks a lot, Joe Gaza.
[142:26.58]For the nine months.
[142:27.28]Buy your mama a mob empire.
[142:28.88]Here's $300.
[142:29.54]I missed the turn.
[142:36.62]Get out of the way.
[142:46.58]It's not even that bad outside.
[142:48.65]Go cat puke somewhere else.
[142:55.56]Stay back, let him fight it out.
[143:01.22]Who said that?
[143:02.02]Did she say that?
[143:05.95]I think she said that.
[143:13.37]That's so funny.
[143:14.93]Stay back, let him fight it out.
[143:16.81]I'm talking about me.
[143:17.87]It's like 2500 bucks.
[143:25.68]Well, I'm actually glad that they didn't go off on a gigantic cutscene telling me about both ones.
[143:33.50]No, I spoke too soon.
[143:33.94]Never mind.
[143:54.13]At least his hair has actual texture.
[144:15.83]Let's go get Vito.
[144:16.37]I can't wait till I have white hair like that.
[144:17.73]Just full white ass hair.
[144:41.75]I'm gonna have like gray, white, a full head of gray hair.
[144:45.37]Can't wait.
[144:46.15]Why?
[144:46.35]What the fuck?
[144:47.87]No.
[144:48.75]I don't want that at all.
[144:49.89]Who said that?
[144:50.51]What fucking demon just like took over my body and said that out of my mouth?
[144:55.16]I don't want that.
[144:55.72]I don't want that.
[144:56.22]What?
[144:56.40]Fuck that.
[144:56.72]That would suck.
[144:57.24]I don't have like gray hair.
[145:08.32]You know, I would see who the other person is, but I don't want to even watch the cutscene.
[145:11.40]Let's go get Vito.
[145:11.99]Fuck, I have to... How's he doing since Danny?
[145:26.64]Nine weeks ago, Burke stumbles into Roman the Butcher Barbieri's deli, drunk off his ass, waving a gun around.
[145:33.57]Fires off ten rounds.
[145:35.11]The only thing he manages to hit is a fucking ham hock in the goddamn deli case.
[145:39.47]Butcher boys slap the shit out of him and toss him in a dumpster.
[145:43.33]Barbieri's the one who took over Point for Done, right?
[145:45.86]I'm closer to 35 than I am to, like, 25.
[145:49.36]How scary is that?
[145:50.18]He thought he'd make things clear with Sal, and he'd be able to get Point for Done.
[145:52.84]That is scary.
[145:54.04]He always struck me as an asshole.
[145:57.28]That is not a thought I want to be thinking about right now.
[146:02.63]Did somebody just give me a picture of a guy puking?
[146:08.81]Who took that picture?
[146:10.25]Why would you take... Whose photo is that?
[146:23.60]Okay, I kind of want to go fight the guy that pukes on camera.
[146:28.36]Hey, take a look.
[146:28.90]I got a picture of him here.
[146:29.88]He's throwing up.
[146:30.68]Alright, get me out of your shitty apartment.
[146:40.35]I don't even have an HDTV.
[146:44.61]What a scumbag.
[146:53.17]Alright, let's get some action.
[146:58.89]Do I have options here?
[147:01.93]This is cut and run.
[147:03.11]Talk to Burke.
[147:04.91]And this is River Row.
[147:06.41]Work the man who bleeds.
[147:07.49]Vito.
[147:07.97]We're doing this one.
[147:08.81]I want to go get Vito.
[147:12.08]Heading to Vito's.
[147:14.76]Heading to Danny DeVito's.
[147:25.18]I just got negative G's right there.
[147:30.24]Whatever I had for lunch just swished around in my stomach a hundred times.
[147:46.81]This is no...
[147:51.62]How fast was I going?
[147:52.46]100 miles per hour?
[147:54.16]And I just rolled out like that.
[147:57.64]That does not... That does not work like that.
[148:02.13]That doesn't work.
[148:04.89]You can't go 100 and jump out of the car and just be fine.
[148:10.25]It doesn't work like that.
[148:20.12]I can't even see.
[148:24.24]All I see is orange.
[148:28.20]And that guy's obituary.
[148:36.12]Should've drove on the road when I was on it.
[148:41.87]Find Vito.
[148:50.58]Make a grand entrance, that's what I say.
[148:53.68]What, these guys are fucking hostile?
[148:55.32]What?
[148:55.52]Why are these guys hostile?
[148:57.98]Didn't do anything.
[149:07.65]Oh, got him!
[149:08.45]That was such a fucking intense gun battle.
[149:14.09]Wait, how did he die?
[149:17.05]Yeah, now his friend came over and his friend knows how to aim.
[149:46.94]This gun doesn't have any fucking bullets.
[149:48.98]I keep trying to shoot it every time.
[149:51.79]Stop trying to shoot this gun.
[149:53.57]The fact that you get like 10 shots.
[150:07.43]Stupid assholes.
[150:12.35]Oh, I gotta call like Sneaky Snake Man.
[150:15.97]Whatever his name is.
[150:31.81]Ow, my fucking head.
[150:32.79]Ow.
[150:33.81]Ow.
[150:34.95]Okay, I'm giving myself a bad headache.
[150:45.30]Ow.
[150:45.48]He was going so fucking fast.
[150:52.96]He was going like at least 100.
[150:54.39]Ugh.
[151:02.83]That fucking hurts my head.
[151:10.25]This guy is a fucking idiot.
[151:12.25]He's driving on like the train tracks.
[151:23.31]Wait a second, where are you going?
[151:27.96]Where are you going?
[151:33.59]Man, I don't know why that fucking just got me so bad.
[151:37.49]He's speeding down the street and he was going... It was at least 60 miles per hour and he drove straight into me.
[151:48.17]It didn't even hurt me at all.
[151:51.15]I can't even... I can't... I can't play this fucking game.
[151:59.93]I seriously can't.
[152:03.04]I get into a mode like this and then I'm useless.
[152:11.66]Come again, come again.
[152:15.79]Okay, fine.
[152:16.11]I need some more ammo.
[152:17.09]I need some more ammo, come quick!
[152:23.31]Awww.
[152:24.69]Somebody got in the way.
[152:25.57]Oh, that's too bad.
[152:30.21]He didn't do it this time.
[152:33.36]I'm going to use this car as cover.
[152:40.28]Nice shot.
[152:41.54]Give me some health.
[152:49.69]Alright, now please drive around in a circle and ram into me.
[152:53.15]God damn.
[153:05.23]Show your head.
[153:13.82]These guys also have molotovs too.
[153:17.78]The mafia has molotovs.
[153:21.01]The hillbilly guys have molotovs.
[153:24.51]It's just the new grenade joke.
[153:27.35]From death to spies.
[153:28.57]They just always have them.
[153:37.42]I seriously have a headache right now.
[153:40.51]Damn it.
[153:40.85]This is an on-rails shooter at this point.
[154:02.54]Health.
[154:04.12]I will take one of those.
[154:11.39]Just shoot the fucking wall.
[154:12.65]Just shot the wall.
[154:16.53]Great.
[154:17.01]Great work.
[154:20.17]Throw some fire in there.
[154:21.59]This here's the last day of your miserable life.
[154:41.79]Brutal takedown.
[154:42.69]I should probably start to do that.
[154:50.00]Oh, brutal doom.
[154:52.10]Guys, remember brutal doom?
[154:53.00]Oh, wait, I gotta hack the interface.
[155:00.50]Nice, hacked it.
[155:06.33]Did I get it?
[155:08.63]Did I hack the mainframe?
[155:13.59]I did.
[155:13.95]Have you ever heard of this magic truck adrenaline?
[155:25.52]It fixes bullet holes.
[155:31.45]Wait, why am I freeing Vito?
[155:36.41]That was awful.
[155:38.33]Holy shit.
[155:42.85]I can't imagine how horrible... Like stomping directly into somebody's face.
[156:01.91]Wait, this isn't the guy.
[156:03.89]Okay, I thought this was the guy from before.
[156:06.24]Bullets don't deflect off the skulls, I don't think.
[156:08.48]It's kind of crazy.
[156:09.26]So this is the guy from Mafia 2?
[156:11.96]From my understanding, right?
[156:35.09]Said he wanted to wait for the heat to die down.
[156:38.77]You want me running around, buying expensive shit, getting noticed.
[156:42.41]Thanks a lot, Miracle Aligner.
[156:45.27]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[156:47.75]Look at this gray hair.
[156:52.52]Nice fucking gray hair, dude.
[156:53.90]Can't wait for that.
[156:54.50]The money I fronted for the robbery was pretty much everything I put away.
[156:56.98]Didn't have enough to run, so I stayed.
[157:04.29]They do?
[157:04.69]Bolts bounce off bone all the time?
[157:06.27]Really?
[157:06.61]Certain calibers?
[157:07.37]I guess, yeah.
[157:07.79]Bleh.
[157:35.95]I missed your bits.
[157:44.10]Did I wear them?
[157:44.86]Oh, I did.
[157:45.58]Fuck.
[157:45.94]Well, thanks, Premium.
[157:46.84]I looked over.
[157:48.84]I didn't.
[157:50.17]For some reason, sometimes it doesn't show.
[157:52.99]No, okay.
[157:56.19]Actually, I can see them clear as day right now.
[157:57.91]Yeah, thanks, Premium.
[158:00.55]Thanks for the bits, dude.
[158:01.91]And thanks to Leo for the sub.
[158:04.01]Even a .22 can penetrate a skull.
[158:04.73]It's very unlikely for a skull to ricochet a bullet.
[158:07.39]CSI Twitch chat in here.
[158:08.85]We got all kinds of detectives and forensic scientists.
[158:10.65]You bring me Greco.
[158:36.96]Yeah, why are we not killing this guy?
[158:40.91]Because... This guy got screwed over by the bad guy.
[158:46.95]Enhance that reflection.
[158:49.53]Alright.
[158:51.33]Where are we going next?
[159:08.10]What's next on the list of places to go all the way up here?
[159:12.04]This is really far away.
[159:15.63]Talk to Burke.
[159:22.27]Can I get a taxi or take a train or something?
[159:24.29]Do I have to really walk or drive all the way there?
[159:29.12]Has to be a fast travel, right?
[159:34.26]Hey, look at that.
[159:35.94]Oh, no.
[159:36.44]Never mind.
[159:39.11]The Consiglieri.
[159:42.53]I know how to say it.
[159:43.67]It's Consiglieri.
[159:45.08]It's Consiglieri.
[159:46.74]I know how to say it.
[159:47.62]I saw.
[159:48.54]Analyze that.
[159:53.98]The Consiglieri.
[159:55.40]This is the guy that I was just talking to?
[160:04.19]Nice shoes.
[160:08.80]That was a very dramatic overreaction.
[160:14.35]Vito says you can help me get this bread of mine to a safe place.
[160:17.51]Sure can, honey.
[160:18.45]Any friend of Vito's is a friend of mine.
[160:20.77]Be there like a display.
[160:25.19]This is a dead guy.
[160:26.01]Is there a place I can dump this guy in the water?
[160:41.86]I wish there was just a pick guy up button.
[160:45.04]I would love to do it.
[160:51.16]Nope, I can't.
[160:55.26]I would love nothing more than just to dump this guy in the water.
[161:00.58]There is this guy though.
[161:01.50]Is that Falco?
[161:09.66]food come get food alligators come get it it's insane alright let's go nobody cleaned this up yet I figured somebody would have
[161:32.99]Oh, you can.
[161:34.59]And you will.
[161:35.28]Did you do that?
[161:48.21]You definitely did that.
[161:50.75]You've ran a guy over getting over here.
[161:53.93]Oh no, not another psycho driver.
[162:03.96]That was a pretty sick dodge, I'm not gonna lie.
[162:15.83]No mercy.
[162:28.06]That was a pretty good dodge on my part, too.
[162:29.62]I'm not gonna lie.
[162:32.30]Look at that.
[162:32.82]That too.
[162:33.22]I'm not gonna lie.
[162:35.34]Getting better at driving in this game.
[162:47.36]Don't drop the sandwich!
[162:48.56]Don't drop the sandwich, whatever you do.
[163:03.10]Police witness to crime?
[163:05.29]No witnesses, hold on, no witnesses!
[163:12.29]Immediately resort to shooting, that's great.
[163:15.74]Nice frames.
[163:29.39]There's a nice bridge.
[163:30.19]We're going over the bridge.
[163:31.41]We're finally gonna go over the Golden Gate Bridge, wherever the hell we are.
[163:34.48]I wanna look behind me.
[163:47.82]I'm running on spokes right now.
[163:49.44]Are all four tires gone?
[163:54.88]Yeah.
[163:58.02]Thanks for the boost.
[164:05.83]You can see their faces in the rear view mirror right now.
[164:10.52]Take a look at the rear view.
[164:11.76]It's great.
[164:12.84]When they get close.
[164:16.70]By the way, that cop is the same guy.
[164:19.20]Twice.
[164:19.48]Look at the rear view.
[164:24.79]I want to get a good view of them.
[164:36.98]Grab that auto is better.
[164:47.70]These call themselves the real police.
[164:51.62]I promise we're the real police this time.
[164:53.69]Not those fake ones you keep hearing about.
[165:01.43]Could just get another car.
[165:03.29]But who wants to do that?
[165:04.33]What's the fun in that?
[165:11.47]This thing is gonna blow.
[165:22.97]He's out the window still.
[165:28.49]Look at this guy.
[165:29.45]Look at the cop in the car that's tipped over.
[165:31.19]He's still aiming out the window.
[165:40.29]Get out of the car, man.
[165:48.15]Yeah, those damn fake police.
[165:50.41]They lost me?
[165:51.90]Oh, shit.
[166:12.06]I said this before and I'll say it again.
[166:13.48]How do they keep knowing where I am?
[166:22.86]You'd be going faster in the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.
[166:25.46]I would be.
[166:30.40]What a funny car, by the way.
[166:35.46]Thanks a lot, Lucy.
[166:44.01]Actually not that far away, no.
[166:49.22]Did he spawn behind me?
[166:50.08]That's what happened.
[166:58.30]What is this?
[167:02.15]No, I don't want to talk to this guy.
[167:12.06]900 meters away.
[167:16.14]I'm gonna get there.
[167:20.83]Stop stream sniping me, cops.
[167:22.23]What the hell?
[167:39.12]I wanted to do that inside of his car.
[167:41.79]Look at this thing.
[167:43.05]This thing is nice.
[167:43.85]Have we ever been able to hit a V48 engine?
[167:56.81]Why does it run like a bag of shit?
[168:04.87]Alright.
[168:05.55]Do not screw this car up because this thing is... is great.
[168:10.57]Don't screw it up.
[168:15.48]Hello.
[168:18.30]Good afternoon, officer!
[168:19.78]Where's the beep?
[168:35.57]You got a problem?
[168:37.35]Is there a problem, officer?
[168:43.80]Yeah, you don't like when you see me do donuts in front of you?
[168:47.60]Yeah.
[168:56.77]Yeah, somebody's committing crimes around you.
[169:00.65]You're not paying much attention.
[169:04.43]I hit him with a car.
[169:06.13]We have a colored male driving erratically.
[169:08.11]Immediate response requested.
[169:17.11]Left alt.
[169:18.03]Just tell me to do left alt.
[169:20.71]Run.
[169:22.39]He's not even a real cop.
[169:24.27]If you got real police, real police, real police incoming.
[169:41.83]Oh, my frames.
[169:42.63]I just felt my frame rate just go down to two.
[169:52.17]They already fucked the car up.
[169:54.47]Excuse me.
[169:56.03]There's a jump.
[169:59.15]I'm sorry, cops, but there's something way more important.
[170:03.58]They shot the tires out.
[170:04.74]That's annoying.
[170:05.48]This guy in the Winnebago is beeping.
[170:10.78]That's so easy to shoot.
[170:26.01]These people... These people are beeping.
[170:32.53]Oh, it's his stomach.
[170:35.81]Oh, I'm just in like a fucking giggly ass mood right now, man.
[170:52.56]That's making me laugh.
[170:54.87]Good thing I got the car back.
[171:06.06]I'm so sorry.
[171:07.16]I'm like a fucking... Tickle me Elmo right now.
[171:10.32]I'm just like... At every single little thing.
[171:21.66]Did I just get like in a little car accident?
[171:28.37]Oh my god!
[171:29.11]Did somebody just get like in a crash in front of me?
[171:31.61]This is extremely fast.
[171:47.51]You are a scary person.
[171:50.81]Well, very good idea.
[171:51.81]I'll try not to
[172:07.47]I can't punch through.
[172:08.59]I can't hit these guys.
[172:10.81]Look how creepy these guys are.
[172:13.73]No, no, no, no, no.
[172:14.34]I need to show the world how creepy you are.
[172:16.72]Stop it.
[172:17.86]Stop driving.
[172:23.66]Come here.
[172:26.15]He was just slapping.
[172:36.48]Ah, fuck it.
[172:37.36]He had a huge smile when he got out of that car.
[172:41.14]What an actor.
[172:47.37]Alright, let's go.
[172:49.29]Mission time.
[172:49.91]Uh, it is the game.
[172:57.97]The game is... just runs like shit.
[173:05.29]So sometimes when I like turn corners, it's just like... Here's the drunk guy.
[173:19.54]What am I looking at?
[173:24.84]Where are we?
[173:25.10]Are we in like heaven right now?
[173:33.72]This is the hottest son on Earth.
[173:35.32]Okay.
[173:45.83]Is this a flashback or is this actually happening?
[173:48.55]I don't know.
[173:48.95]I think it's getting worse.
[173:50.07]I feel like it's getting worse.
[174:10.27]Oh my god, this is terrible.
[174:12.17]It's an old shitty Polaroid that somebody just took and it's not developed yet.
[174:15.40]I didn't do this.
[174:17.40]I swear to god, I promise I didn't do this.
[174:34.67]I can't even look at the screen.
[174:36.25]I'm not kidding.
[174:36.71]I have to look away.
[174:40.69]I saw green.
[174:44.59]Ah.
[174:45.61]Faking stuff.
[174:49.53]Thank God.
[174:52.70]Fucking keys.
[174:57.32]What?
[174:57.60]Burke needs convincing that your speed.
[174:59.48]Drive dangerously.
[175:00.42]Drive on the wrong side.
[175:01.22]Okay, I have to drive like an idiot.
[175:05.58]Why is he behind the wheel?
[175:12.75]Oh.
[175:13.09]Alright, I have to drive her radically.
[175:15.41]This guy's got a jackhammer!
[175:31.55]That guy was just jackhammering in the middle of the street.
[175:34.25]That's the shot.
[175:35.43]Maybe there's hope for you yet, you monkey.
[175:37.55]Get back here, you pig.
[175:41.74]Fast enough for you?
[175:47.60]Without Thomas Burke, Lincoln's war against Sal Marcano ended before it really had a chance to begin.
[175:53.64]Lincoln's bloated body was pulled out of the river a few days later.
[176:09.70]He wanted me to go.
[176:10.87]He wanted me to press him.
[176:13.99]It's a little too dangerous.
[176:17.33]That was the first time we got one of those in a long time.
[176:19.11]Okay, let's go.
[176:26.81]Fight me.
[176:27.27]Fight me, Burke.
[176:30.11]How about I drive?
[176:33.14]Like, look at this guy.
[176:34.64]This is fascinating to me.
[176:36.24]What is he doing with his hand?
[176:37.70]Look at this.
[176:38.20]Watch his hand.
[177:06.89]Is he turning the keys?
[177:09.71]He's turning invisible keys and he keeps doing it.
[177:15.36]Either that or he's really trying to show me how strong his wrists are.
[177:24.40]I will shove that gun up your ass.
[177:36.19]Sit your ass back down.
[177:37.39]We going for a ride.
[177:42.61]Okay, let's go.
[177:43.21]I'm gonna shove the gun up my ass.
[177:58.28]No, we're going.
[177:58.86]This is a jump.
[177:59.52]We're going up and jump.
[178:00.54]You can't flop on your jaw box now, are you?
[178:08.72]He's still just sitting in the car.
[178:12.52]He's not going to get out.
[178:13.46]He's still up there.
[178:15.30]He's still up there sitting in the passenger seat.
[178:17.16]Just like, oh, well, that was kind of fun.
[178:18.70]Are you going to come up here and help me out?
[178:24.52]You're telling me I can't get up this.
[178:28.12]It looks like the easiest thing to get up.
[178:34.85]I can't get up there.
[178:35.37]I'm going to fail the mission again.
[178:40.12]Can I yell to him Burke finally Jesus alright I got 40 seconds 40 seconds 35 seconds, why do I have two timers?
[178:57.07]What is this counting down it's counting down twice alright get the fuck out of the way This ain't your lucky day motherfucker
[179:10.53]Alright.
[179:15.17]Are you impressed yet?
[179:16.03]Because I think we're stuck here.
[179:18.27]No, we're not.
[179:18.81]We're not.
[179:20.93]Okay.
[179:33.33]Alright.
[179:36.80]That hurt.
[179:39.22]How long do I... I don't understand.
[179:41.02]How long do I have to keep this up for?
[179:48.50]I can't stop the car?
[179:53.75]Almost hit a car.
[179:54.69]Speeding.
[179:56.49]I just have to keep it up.
[179:58.75]Thread the needle.
[180:04.53]I can't get out.
[180:06.18]No.
[180:06.36]Come on.
[180:06.84]Put me on rails for that.
[180:08.56]Okay.
[180:08.82]Dick.
[180:09.02]I did it.
[180:11.12]I won.
[180:39.65]Sandwich.
[180:42.83]Newspaper.
[180:43.31]What else we got?
[180:46.01]What other pedestrians do we have?
[180:47.05]Is that a sandwich?
[180:51.48]Just took out that whole fence.
[181:01.12]Thanks a lot, Purple Pancakes, for the two months.
[181:05.03]And then thank you to Aramid.
[181:06.83]Or Airmid.
[181:07.89]For subscribing.
[181:08.55]Welcome, dude.
[181:10.55]Thanks Akivas for the bits, thanks DarkGD for the bits, and also NeverTrustAPurple with more bits.
[181:17.25]I'm so impressed he died.
[181:21.05]Out of the circle, I can go meat burp.
[181:26.29]I can go shit my hand and throw it at him.
[181:28.13]I can go piss on him.
[181:35.05]I'm gonna go spit on him.
[181:35.89]I'm gonna go, like, puke on him.
[181:37.62]I'm gonna bleed on him.
[181:39.02]What other, like, bodily functions can I do to this guy?
[181:45.76]I'm gonna piss in a cup and, like, throw it at him.
[181:48.06]Like it's a cup of coffee.
[181:55.86]Fucking dickhead almost ran me over.
[182:07.01]Sweat on him.
[182:07.65]Yeah, I'm going to go in for a workout and just stand over him.
[182:17.98]How do I get in here?
[182:22.58]No, that's out.
[182:23.72]Easy.
[182:23.86]You ran into a guy named Jerma985 in Overwatch?
[182:27.54]Yeah.
[182:34.97]It's not me.
[182:58.61]This guy just gets shit-faced.
[183:00.09]That's all this guy does.
[183:01.15]You can trust this purple, right?
[183:02.13]That is true.
[183:02.53]There are two purples here.
[183:03.55]Purple pancakes and never trust a purple.
[183:07.34]Which one can I trust?
[183:07.94]Purple.
[183:19.91]Thanks a lot, Science Cheese.
[183:21.65]Welcome.
[183:21.81]Squeaky Squawk.
[183:45.55]I'd rather be running this whole damn town or burning it to the ground.
[183:51.95]But honest, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference to me either way.
[184:00.33]Halloween Horror Stream?
[184:04.77]I want to do something, but it's getting closer and closer and closer every day.
[184:11.50]I haven't thought of something to do.
[184:13.10]I want to do something, though.
[184:19.66]Scottish beer?
[184:20.46]Yeah, it kind of is.
[184:24.10]Get a new ride brought to you.
[184:30.38]That's the only one I can use.
[184:34.34]You can call the vehicle delivery service to bring cars from your garage.
[184:37.95]Unlock new cars for your garage by dealing with Marcano's lieutenants.
[184:42.51]Okay.
[184:47.93]Here it comes.
[184:55.75]Free car.
[184:56.85]I'll take it.
[185:00.89]Wait, wait.
[185:03.59]Hold on.
[185:08.41]You guys playing Squindlestones?
[185:12.62]They are.
[185:17.37]We found the swindle stones.
[185:18.75]Where the hell am I going?
[185:42.93]Uh... Here?
[185:45.21]No, over here.
[185:48.29]Contraband.
[185:49.76]Union extortion.
[185:52.88]Or... I mean, I feel like I can talk to him.
[185:58.60]Should I talk to him again?
[185:59.31]Why would you walk in front of this car?
[186:07.61]This person's a madman.
[186:09.82]Just get out of the car.
[186:10.90]I can't be trusted with it.
[186:20.62]Obviously cannot be trusted with a car.
[186:28.49]He's over here.
[186:33.93]Why would I want to wiretap my own friends?
[186:39.95]Seems kind of counterintuitive, doesn't it?
[186:49.22]That's out of reach?
[186:50.08]What?
[186:57.75]Playboy.
[187:02.43]Guy can throw himself up a ladder, but he can't climb a foot in front of his face.
[187:10.09]Oh, whatever.
[187:10.61]Screw it.
[187:10.89]I'll do something else.
[187:15.16]Hey, Aeronaut.
[187:15.76]Hope your night's going well.
[187:20.40]I don't care if you call the police.
[187:24.44]Don't care.
[187:25.30]Let's go.
[187:34.19]Are there any units that can stop this madman?
[187:46.15]Made it.
[187:59.36]Nice ride.
[188:01.29]This thing is pretty sweet.
[188:09.28]Can these cops get off my back, please?
[188:13.02]I swear to God.
[188:26.52]Here's the mission, right?
[188:27.50]Yeah.
[188:29.79]Clown car video?
[188:55.23]Uh, you'll see it.
[188:58.33]Can't say it's coming soon, but you'll see one.
[188:59.77]That's what the clown car looks like, yeah.
[189:00.67]That would be pretty close, actually.
[189:02.41]Protection.
[189:21.36]Whole lot of walk to here or drive to here and talk to person.
[189:28.57]Where's the flaming car missions?
[189:30.19]Where's the boat missions?
[189:33.01]Where's the fight missions?
[189:39.24]Nothing down there?
[189:46.76]What is that?
[189:49.86]It's a note.
[189:52.08]Okay.
[189:54.12]Well, fuck it.
[189:54.54]We're just gonna go talk to Bear Donnelly.
[190:04.90]This sucks.
[190:07.84]I have to swim?
[190:13.14]When's the naked lady?
[190:13.98]You missed the naked lady's mission.
[190:15.16]It already happened.
[190:15.70]That was like a couple hours ago.
[190:24.44]Somebody just said I suck.
[190:25.28]This streamer sucks.
[190:30.72]Bailfish, this guy sucks.
[190:31.70]Who said I suck?
[190:32.34]This guy sucks.
[190:43.26]I want to just climb up the side.
[190:45.16]What are you doing, man?
[190:47.78]Get in the boat.
[190:53.72]Well, I was looking at chat.
[190:54.98]I swam by a ladder because I'm staring at chat.
[191:03.74]You're gonna think I'm crazy, but... Worked like a charm.
[191:25.58]Yeah, I know.
[191:26.18]I understand that the police come.
[191:28.28]I know.
[191:29.84]I heard they were sucking.
[191:42.25]I love how somebody just wrote, hey, Jerma, it's me, Jeff.
[191:45.17]That's it.
[191:45.99]They didn't write anything else.
[191:47.45]They didn't even finish the story.
[191:48.55]It's just, hey, it's me, Jeff.
[191:53.10]Jeff from where?
[191:55.14]Jeff from psychology?
[191:56.50]Jeff from the grocery store?
[191:57.86]I don't know where your Jeff is from.
[192:04.17]Greetings and salutations.
[192:06.52]Greetings and salutations.
[192:07.72]Please give me a cutscene.
[192:09.06]You see a lot of negative reviews in this game?
[192:12.02]What do I think?
[192:12.78]Well, it's not good.
[192:13.40]It's not very good.
[192:34.07]It's not bad either.
[192:37.72]I've been enjoying my time in it.
[192:38.90]I think it's fun.
[192:42.30]But I guess at the point I'm at right now, it gets very, very repetitive.
[192:47.02]You can't do the same types of missions over and over again.
[192:49.04]Cutscenes are cool.
[192:49.52]The graphics are good when they work.
[192:51.26]Dead guy on the couch at one o'clock.
[193:12.46]He's dead.
[193:17.56]Are his eyes open?
[193:25.65]Sir, are you awake?
[193:28.49]This guy is just a piece of the set.
[193:29.95]He's not even real.
[193:31.59]He's part of the couch.
[193:34.41]This guy isn't even breathing.
[193:41.18]Yeah, all the characters have nice teeth.
[193:43.34]That is true.
[193:56.57]He is the coach.
[193:58.83]Alright, let's go beat some people up for this mission.
[194:01.03]I think that's what we have to do.
[194:02.05]It's called beat down.
[194:04.74]I'll beat some people down, sure.
[194:06.70]Where is the door?
[194:09.99]geez louise that woke him up well I see you're awake now after being shot with a shotgun through a window
[194:43.69]So he's not bulletproof.
[194:44.57]I was just making sure.
[194:45.41]I wanted to check and see if he was bulletproof.
[194:50.97]I thought he was bulletproof.
[194:52.20]He's not.
[194:59.66]He's like eyes open.
[195:06.66]Okay, let's do this.
[195:09.15]Beat down, right?
[195:11.13]Protection.
[195:11.71]Alright, there's a guy right here.
[195:19.86]Well, yeah, he was asleep.
[195:20.94]That's fine.
[195:21.56]I shot him through the window with a gun.
[195:24.08]And he was like, time for the nap.
[195:25.76]Nap's over.
[195:26.20]Okay, so these guys have guns.
[195:32.88]Can I climb this?
[195:33.74]I'm obviously going to do a running spear on this guy.
[195:52.51]Like, you didn't think I was gonna do that?
[195:54.67]You're crazy.
[195:58.73]Oh shit, they're all spreading out.
[196:02.52]That was an innocent person, I think.
[196:08.32]What the fuck?
[196:13.29]What are these guys doing?
[196:17.05]Why are these guys holding their arms like that?
[196:18.87]This is freaking me out.
[196:25.93]Oh, he's sleeping for real.
[196:35.98]Wait, hold on.
[196:36.52]Wait, wait, wait.
[196:37.06]We got another sleeping guy.
[196:38.50]Another guy that's asleep.
[196:39.60]Alright, just to make sure.
[196:42.67]Yeah, he is, in fact, asleep.
[196:46.45]He moved a little bit.
[196:52.57]His arm moved.
[196:55.05]Oh, here he goes.
[196:55.62]He's moving.
[196:56.74]Did I wake him up?
[196:58.32]No.
[197:01.10]Okay.
[197:01.86]Attempt number two.
[197:04.06]Attempt number two is going to be a little different.
[197:12.09]Okay.
[197:13.65]So here's attempt number two.
[197:16.33]Is the guy sleeping on the couch invulnerable?
[197:28.39]Okay, uh, I don't know.
[197:29.83]I don't think so.
[197:32.23]Glass is broken.
[197:35.65]No, they're not!
[197:36.43]He's not, he's not, he's not.
[197:40.87]Why was the other guy?
[197:41.91]I'm doing this for scientific research.
[197:49.35]I just want to be sure of what's happening.
[197:56.75]Let's just go to the beatdown mission.
[198:01.70]The sword swing just came out for me.
[198:08.94]Oh, the sun.
[198:23.81]Just get out of it.
[198:32.17]Fucking guy four times in the chest and that's what kills him.
[198:46.69]Hey, nobody talks about piss or shit but me.
[198:49.43]Is this guy going to show his face?
[198:59.18]What?
[199:00.50]What a sneaky snake.
[199:19.12]Oh my god.
[199:22.06]Fuck off with these- What was that noise?
[199:27.85]Who is shooting?
[199:30.44]A sniper rifle through the wall.
[199:31.75]What are you, stupid?
[199:32.49]There he is.
[199:42.37]He's got a rifle.
[199:43.26]Ow.
[199:44.42]Am I using a controller?
[199:48.28]No, it's just the... The frame rate is kind of all over the place, so it's hard to aim.
[199:54.28]Even with a mouse.
[200:04.67]That was a lot of money.
[200:07.53]Plus we need to beat down... I'm right next to this one, might as well do it.
[200:23.78]You want some money, guy?
[200:24.68]I think the guy might be dead.
[200:37.88]Game sucks.
[200:44.53]I'm sorry, I'm going to have to commandeer your vehicle.
[200:50.09]Do not be alarmed.
[200:52.85]Just step away from the car.
[200:54.29]I'm confused what these guys are doing.
[201:08.39]No.
[201:09.07]Cops don't even know I'm over here.
[201:10.19]Okay.
[201:10.53]That's fine.
[201:14.56]Thanks, Aerolus.
[201:16.10]For the 100 bits.
[201:16.80]Thank you to Worm Wired.
[201:18.16]For the sub.
[201:20.52]Hentai Butts.
[201:22.06]Fishy RJ.
[201:23.53]Theezy Now.
[201:26.71]Thanks for subbing, guys.
[201:34.32]welcome to the channel welcome thanks for the youtube content take my Amazon sub well thanks worm Amazon primo I love it there's no consequence just dive out of a car so why not just ghost ride every single one when you get to a mission
[202:02.69]Doesn't seem to be really a big deal.
[202:15.78]Oh, I'm yawning.
[202:16.70]Why am I yawning?
[202:17.44]Am I already getting tired?
[202:18.60]Oh, there he comes.
[202:33.64]Time for some stealth kills here, guys.
[202:36.96]I just pulled the whole place.
[202:42.74]We do have a gunfight, you are correct.
[203:11.54]One left.
[203:13.24]The man himself.
[203:23.33]Scare him, and then get in there.
[203:29.30]Oh, fuck!
[203:30.14]Out of bullets!
[203:35.20]Holy shit.
[203:37.66]Okay, that guy got destroyed.
[203:45.51]Might as well open up and see what they got in here.
[203:49.93]They're hiding behind the door.
[204:05.60]Oh, wow.
[204:06.08]Look at all these ketchup bottles.
[204:09.69]Look at that ketchup.
[204:11.03]Barbecue sauce.
[204:19.43]Wait, he's calling the police in here?
[204:22.09]Why would... Why would you come in here to call the police?
[204:26.77]I'm in here.
[204:27.31]Who the fuck are you?
[204:35.56]Oh shit, I heard shots fired.
[204:37.12]I'm gonna run into the building that guy's in to call the cops.
[204:45.07]What are you thinking, man?
[204:47.45]Wait, is there anything... I got the register already.
[204:50.68]I don't think there's anything else of use in here.
[205:02.03]I've yet to find a reason to do that.
[205:04.91]Picking people up and hiding them seems to have no purpose in this game.
[205:11.39]You know what I mean?
[205:12.55]Who cares?
[205:13.09]This doesn't even matter.
[205:20.05]That feature doesn't seem to need to be here.
[205:21.89]Are these explosive?
[205:27.87]They are.
[205:33.88]I'll take extra money for blowing these up.
[205:35.48]Why not?
[205:45.29]I have to do this, you know.
[205:47.37]It's a very important thing to do.
[205:48.93]Look at this.
[205:50.90]Lay him on.
[205:51.40]Let's make a human barbecue.
[205:57.42]Didn't work at all.
[205:58.88]Let's just pretend we did.
[205:59.71]Alright, what's the last one to do?
[206:03.39]One more.
[206:05.11]Couple more.
[206:09.01]All these missions are kind of the same.
[206:10.07]I think I'm done with these.
[206:11.83]Let me go down here.
[206:23.63]Yeah, let's go back down here.
[206:25.71]What time is it?
[206:27.43]10 o'clock.
[206:29.79]Weekend at Bernie's 3.
[206:30.79]Alright, so I'm going to come down here and do one more mission.
[206:42.05]And then I'm probably going to call it a night.
[206:46.75]Whatever this next big story mission is, I'm going to do it.
[206:51.48]And then I'm going to call it
[206:54.64]And then we'll be live with sorcery for tomorrow.
[206:57.78]I'm not even going the right way.
[207:02.43]This one.
[207:05.39]Play some tunes.
[207:22.45]This is why the game got mediocre reviews.
[207:25.38]What, is the rest of the game just like this?
[207:28.48]That's too bad, because there seems to be a fun game here somewhere.
[207:35.38]How long have I been playing the game in total?
[207:39.31]Maybe eight hours?
[207:42.33]Seven and a half, eight hours so far?
[207:44.35]Somewhere around like that.
[207:46.75]It's been fun.
[207:47.77]Like, the actual world is fun.
[207:49.19]It's fun to walk around and
[207:52.06]Drive into stuff, obviously.
[207:53.34]It's fun to just cause mayhem in a GTA-type game.
[207:58.87]But I guess at the end of the day, GTA games like Grand Theft Auto have... Not only do they have a cool story and cool combat mechanics.
[208:08.92]Look, this game has an interesting story.
[208:11.74]And the combat is there.
[208:12.90]The gunplay is there.
[208:14.40]The melee fighting is fun.
[208:15.86]It's there.
[208:17.31]It has the same kind of crazy moments that GTA has.
[208:20.97]But damn, does Grand Theft Auto, especially GTA V, have some awesome, awesome missions to do.
[208:27.09]They're everywhere.
[208:30.26]I guess it's only so many times you can cover shoot a bunch of people.
[208:35.10]You know, this is what I'm talking about.
[208:36.22]Let's just fucking, let's change it up.
[208:39.24]I wanted to go over, but I didn't.
[208:46.74]There's only so many times you can hold right click around a corner and shoot like eight guys and then get like five grand.
[208:57.08]I don't know.
[208:57.91]Does it deserve like all the... Must have trucked that guy.
[209:09.67]Does it deserve like a three out of ten?
[209:11.89]I don't think so.
[209:14.37]I think the reviews are probably spot on.
[209:15.85]What is it?
[209:16.75]It's got like a 6 out of 10, right?
[209:20.65]6 out of 10, 6.5 out of 10.
[209:21.95]I would probably agree with that.
[209:34.40]But, I mean, a lot of games you can't do this.
[209:37.12]That guy's an eyepatch.
[209:39.36]But, like, for instance, this shit right here.
[209:42.64]That's my favorite move in the whole game.
[209:45.84]That move makes no sense.
[209:47.40]That's why it's the best move in the whole game.
[209:50.20]You get behind somebody and push them into the ground so their head smashes the ground.
[209:54.80]That's not gonna happen in real life.
[209:57.18]Yeah.
[210:00.03]He's shit-faced.
[210:06.51]Is he drunk?
[210:12.79]Hold on.
[210:16.64]6 out of 10 is basically unplayable garbage these days.
[210:21.47]I kind of disagree to an extent.
[210:23.81]Because... I'm trying to make you scared.
[210:34.54]No, but you are.
[210:35.32]You both are.
[210:36.66]I think... There's a place for 6 and 7 out of 10 games.
[210:46.82]I think like a 6 or 7 out of 10, as long as it's fun to play and as long as it has redeeming qualities.
[210:52.71]Although this game is expensive.
[210:58.31]But in the 10 hours I've been in this game so far, you've heard me laugh, you've heard me talk about, oh, wow, that was crazy, oh, that's cool.
[211:06.11]Like, what determines worth in a video game?
[211:12.18]$60 worth?
[211:12.68]I'm not so sure, but...
[211:15.73]I determine the worth of a game based around how much I enjoy the time I have inside the game.
[211:20.73]Not necessarily what other people have to say.
[211:23.03]That's why rating systems can be a little misleading.
[211:28.48]Another guy with a fucking sandwich.
[211:29.94]Let's put this guy to sleep.
[211:31.24]Next time go to Quiznos.
[211:33.62]6 out of 10 is still above average.
[211:37.82]That's true.
[211:40.85]But as long as I enjoy myself in a game, I would recommend other people play it if they like kind of dicking around.
[211:47.51]Like, I love... I have my most fun in video games when I can just kind of get a world where I can fuck around in.
[211:59.08]So I'm a little biased in the way that being able to do whatever I want in a sandbox, especially a game that's like GTA...
[212:08.28]And especially breaking up some guy's date.
[212:11.06]What is this there?
[212:11.98]What kind of date is this?
[212:16.94]This guy overalls on an eyepatch.
[212:20.67]I'm just going to ruin this date.
[212:24.75]See, in a lot of games you can't ruin a date like this.
[212:28.99]You can't punch the back of a couch and have people not know what happened and where it came from.
[212:32.22]Oh, she's talking shit.
[212:35.76]He doesn't even care.
[212:38.64]And you can't get people doing cat puking.
[212:42.03]Look at this game.
[212:43.01]This game has cat puking people.
[212:48.21]That money, you can't buy that.
[212:50.27]You can't write that.
[212:54.28]She's still going.
[212:57.80]She squatted.
[212:58.28]She did a little squat move.
[213:09.01]Here he is.
[213:09.45]Man, he totally broke up my date.
[213:24.25]And somehow, he's still getting his ass kicked.
[213:30.22]Even in the afterlife.
[213:33.08]Well, he's finally done.
[213:40.15]I'm going to bring him back to her.
[213:41.53]I hope she's still here about to throw a hairball up.
[213:49.89]Because I'm bringing her date back.
[213:55.49]First Tinder date ruined.
[213:57.90]She better still be here.
[214:03.68]She's not here.
[214:07.92]And what are you doing?
[214:11.24]This guy's trying to build up the courage to do something.
[214:13.18]I was about to leave.
[214:14.26]What am I doing?
[214:14.84]Couldn't come up with anything for that guy to say, by the way.
[214:17.56]I'm sitting there, like, thinking of something for him to say, and I just said, I gotta, like, nine times.
[214:26.78]That was great.
[214:43.26]Vito sent me.
[214:44.42]You're Connie, right?
[214:45.72]Yup.
[214:46.42]Connie DeMarco.
[214:47.58]Been keeping an eye on the smuggling business for Vito.
[214:50.42]Roy Thibodeau's in charge now and it's a damn shit show.
[214:53.72]Why hasn't Greco bounced him yet?
[214:55.42]Oh, he'd bounce Roy right into a hole if he got to say so.
[214:58.32]Arms too stiff.
[214:58.94]Greco didn't pick Roy and that puts a target on his back.
[215:02.01]Still, Roy's trying to sell the usual shit from out of Cuba.
[215:04.89]Cigars and... Improv master.
[215:08.09]I'm tired.
[215:08.71]Come on, I'm sleepy.
[215:10.35]Sounds like Greco's scrambling.
[215:13.53]I got a... You know, I've got a... I got a... I've got a... Alright.
[215:16.55]Sure.
[215:17.25]Oh, no.
[215:43.05]I think all these games that I'm doing in this game... All these little mini-games and mini-missions... What's up?
[216:15.44]Jesus, I did not expect that to happen.
[216:24.83]I did not expect that to happen.
[216:27.45]God damn, man.
[216:28.31]See what I'm talking about?
[216:30.70]That's what I'm talking about.
[216:33.64]That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[216:38.89]Please kick more people in the mouth.
[216:40.66]I... Dude, if I knew that that shit was possible, I would have been doing it from the very beginning of the damn game.
[216:48.52]I kicked him square in the face.
[216:52.75]Ayayay, man.
[216:54.53]Every time.
[216:55.05]It gets me every time.
[217:00.33]Please keep... Well, that guy was sitting... That's one of the only people I've ever seen sitting down like that.
[217:04.34]Where I can do...
[217:10.15]Wait, what?
[217:15.15]I'd be amused with a ball in a cup.
[217:16.39]I probably would.
[217:18.89]Block the gas station!
[217:22.57]What?
[217:24.23]Who's screaming?
[217:26.67]Alright, let's go.
[217:28.19]Come on over here.
[217:32.78]This is where it ends.
[217:34.20]You and me.
[217:36.54]You and me at the gas station.
[217:38.98]How's it coming?
[217:41.77]Don't do it.
[217:43.73]Don't do it.
[217:45.47]That's not smart.
[217:47.09]I'm telling you, I know from experience.
[218:05.56]Oh, he just tried to uppercut me.
[218:13.35]I gotta get this guy to do this.
[218:18.85]It's very important.
[218:27.84]No, over here!
[218:28.38]Over here!
[218:28.66]You fucking idiot!
[218:29.30]Right here!
[218:30.10]No!
[218:30.72]The gas!
[218:31.68]The gas can!
[218:33.34]Ah!
[218:35.70]Damn it.
[218:39.57]The hell was that?
[218:42.59]A lot of ammo in that shotgun.
[218:44.05]That would have been fucking hilarious.
[218:47.29]But... You know, game sucks.
[218:50.31]So I couldn't latch on to the right thing.
[218:54.15]Would have been a good joke.
[218:54.97]It would have been great.
[218:57.39]Alright, I'm going to do this last mission and then I'm going to bed.
[219:04.09]I've got to find another guy to kick in the face though.
[219:07.57]Because that was perfect.
[219:08.66]And he was over here.
[219:14.79]Can't... Hold on.
[219:16.19]Wait a minute.
[219:22.52]Can I get, like, an object over here?
[219:31.46]No, that didn't work.
[219:34.47]Get real close to me.
[219:39.91]I'm always hoping it would just boot him right in the face, like Big Boot Undertaker style.
[219:56.00]No.
[219:57.22]I guess you can only keep people that are sitting down.
[220:05.21]Why was that such a wind-up?
[220:07.53]I did a full wind-up to do that.
[220:09.05]Come on, guy sitting down.
[220:11.51]Guy sitting down.
[220:12.83]Anybody sitting down.
[220:13.81]Where are all the people sitting on their front steps?
[220:20.27]Come on.
[220:22.81]Where's the one random NPC that spawns there?
[220:30.35]Oh, well.
[220:35.87]Hold that thought.
[220:41.45]Sun's got to get out of the way.
[220:47.36]Why is it not working this time?
[220:49.02]That was so one in a million, apparently.
[220:58.78]I can't seem to do it to this guy.
[221:01.76]I kicked across that guy's face.
[221:08.73]No.
[221:11.53]I guess that was a one in a million chance for that to happen.
[221:18.41]Unless I have to be, like, behind him somehow?
[221:26.38]I don't know.
[221:27.72]Well, at least we got to see it once.
[221:32.64]I'm gonna go to the last mission.
[221:35.80]Kick the guy on the couch?
[221:37.69]You can't attack inside of a building like that.
[221:40.51]I would.
[221:45.65]Alright.
[221:46.77]Final mission of the evening.
[221:47.63]So we're right here.
[221:48.69]Bright sun.
[222:02.68]I have my eyes peeled so much.
[222:04.24]I care more about a guy sitting on the bench.
[222:07.15]Or a guy sitting on the stairs more than anything else.
[222:08.81]I don't care about the mission at all.
[222:12.96]Found him.
[222:14.98]Come on.
[222:15.28]Let me get up on this table.
[222:16.58]Hope you guys are enjoying your picnic.
[222:19.84]It's about to get ruined.
[222:28.05]No, it didn't do it.
[222:30.01]No, I just like slugged my arm around that guy's head.
[222:32.97]I think it's a lost cause.
[222:37.12]That was a fucking one in a million chance.
[222:50.29]Give me a gun.
[222:51.35]I want that shotgun.
[222:52.17]Give it to me.
[223:01.87]Whoa.
[223:02.93]I'm dead.
[223:05.59]Somebody clipped it.
[223:06.27]Somebody clipped it.
[223:06.85]I want to watch it.
[223:08.39]I'm watching this right now.
[223:12.47]I want to see this shit.
[223:16.34]That I'm doing in this game.
[223:17.38]All these little mini games and mini missions.
[223:19.60]Let me see this.
[223:29.10]Oh my fucking god.
[223:39.91]Oh, man.
[223:42.81]Alright, well.
[223:46.25]That's going to be it.
[223:47.45]I'm going to leave it there.
[223:50.11]Thanks.
[223:52.03]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[223:53.88]I'm heading to bed.
[223:55.70]The clip is linked in the chat.
[223:58.78]Gioro just put it out here.
[224:05.22]Upload that clip to YouTube without any explanation.
[224:07.18]I'm sure that'll make it into a highlight video for this game.
[224:11.34]So, yeah.
[224:12.40]Tomorrow night is Sorcery Part 4.
[224:13.44]We're going to start it.
[224:16.24]And it should be 7 o'clock again.
[224:19.24]Maybe 6.30.
[224:21.51]6.30, 7 o'clock, 7.30.
[224:22.03]Something like that.
[224:24.53]And I will see you guys tomorrow.
[224:28.43]Thank you for sticking around, everybody.
[224:35.51]Yeah, I guess we hit the point in Mafia where it became the part that everybody complained about.
[224:40.97]Which is run from building to building and kill like seven people.
[224:47.17]So, might have the book closed on Mafia for now unless I get the urge to play it again.
[224:52.83]But goodnight.
[224:53.55]Take care, everybody.
[224:54.07]Thanks for all the new subs, everybody.
[224:55.71]There was a
[224:57.38]There's actually a lot of new subscriptions today.
[224:59.12]Did Prime end?
[225:01.35]Did Twitch Prime have to be re-upped from a lot of people?
[225:04.27]Because I felt like there was a lot of new subscriptions.
[225:10.03]But regardless, thanks a lot.
[225:16.10]Sorcery, 7 o'clock tomorrow.
[225:17.58]Good night.
[225:18.68]Bye, bye, bye.
[225:21.82]Much love.
