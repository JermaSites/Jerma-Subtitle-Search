[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.52]I thought you were retiring.
[00:08.66]Yeah.
[00:10.06]Not right now.
[00:17.43]Late.
[00:19.01]Why?
[00:22.25]He's gonna delay his retirement.
[00:26.45]What are you... Why are you saying that?
[00:27.69]What's going on?
[00:32.62]Yeah, I am very early.
[00:33.86]I'm so early, in fact, that I am almost a full day early.
[00:41.22]I'm one day early.
[00:42.30]I've got some good news for all of you audio Andes that hate everything about my mic setup and my audio setup.
[00:53.32]I've got good news for you.
[00:56.36]My entire audio setup is changing.
[01:00.26]As of after this stream.
[01:06.18]I'm going to have hopefully a really, really crystal clean sound.
[01:13.16]As of next stream.
[01:14.92]Maybe.
[01:15.06]Depends on when I want to get some of this stuff.
[01:23.36]Speaking of mics, hold on.
[01:32.47]Somebody said, you already have a Neumann, what could you improve?
[01:35.35]Um, I like, okay, I like the GoXLR.
[01:42.02]But, I don't, I don't know, I don't like the way that it makes my mic sound.
[01:48.88]I've tried so many settings with this thing.
[01:51.64]The product is an all-encompassing product, right?
[01:56.44]You plug in an XLR mic.
[01:58.69]You have complete control.
[01:59.99]You can do funny sound effects.
[02:01.19]You can do voice changing.
[02:03.25]It's very easy to use software.
[02:06.97]But every time I change a setting on it, I feel like it makes it sound worse.
[02:13.43]I'm going to try a few things.
[02:15.35]I'm going to try this mic with a new compressor.
[02:20.06]See how that sounds?
[02:27.84]I'm going to try maybe a different mic setup, a different positioning of the mic, a different boom arm.
[02:36.19]I'm going to try a few things.
[02:41.00]But how are you going to do funny voice effects?
[02:42.60]Oh, don't worry.
[02:44.10]I might still use the GoXLR.
[02:45.40]I might actually still plug it in and use it.
[02:51.02]Please address this title.
[02:51.94]It sucks.
[02:53.21]I'm just being a bug.
[02:54.33]I'm just being a bug.
[02:54.97]I'm early.
[02:55.37]I'm being a bug.
[02:57.97]Spiders aren't bugs, you nerd.
[02:59.55]Yes, they are.
[02:59.93]A spider is a bug.
[03:03.03]It's a bug.
[03:04.61]What do you want me to say?
[03:05.65]It's not a bug.
[03:06.37]A spider is a bug.
[03:08.94]Yes, it is.
[03:11.57]A bug is a bug.
[03:14.35]I know.
[03:14.73]It's a crustacean.
[03:16.23]It's a crab.
[03:18.07]It's a small crab with extra legs.
[03:21.31]Whatever.
[03:21.75]It's a bug.
[03:22.59]It's the thing that crawls on your wall and it bites you and it has poison in it.
[03:27.66]It will poison you if it fucking touches you.
[03:31.64]Some of them.
[03:35.18]Spiders are bugs but they're not insects.
[03:36.68]Yeah.
[03:37.38]Thank you.
[03:38.22]Appreciate that.
[03:45.04]Jeremy, hurry up and play this stupid game.
[03:46.88]I can only watch for 15 minutes.
[03:48.66]Dude, the game is only four hours long.
[03:57.85]And you should know this by now.
[04:00.23]The first 15 minutes of every one of my streams are awful.
[04:05.02]It's me explaining to you a dream I had.
[04:07.46]Or how much Dunkin Donuts went downhill.
[04:10.75]Or how I forgot to drink water and I'll be right back again.
[04:13.15]The first 15 minutes is a warm-up, man.
[04:15.35]It's gonna be like that every time.
[04:19.19]You said Thursday.
[04:20.03]I know.
[04:22.00]Yeah, I'm full of surprises.
[04:24.86]I did say Thursday.
[04:26.26]Although the reason why I'm here now and starting very late is because I have to take Otto to the vet.
[04:33.16]He's, um... Some things I want to get checked out.
[04:41.09]He's okay.
[04:42.37]I think he's fine.
[04:46.62]Is he okay?
[04:47.70]I think he's going to be 100% fine.
[04:50.19]He just might... He's having the same kind of
[04:54.41]I don't know.
[04:55.51]He's peeing a lot.
[04:57.43]I think he's been prone to getting UTIs.
[05:01.05]He's had it a couple times.
[05:02.09]He's had a UTI a couple times over the last five to ten years.
[05:05.79]I feel like this is starting a new one.
[05:09.94]So I'm just going to go get it checked out.
[05:14.16]See if he's okay.
[05:14.58]Okay.
[05:19.91]He actually had blood work done a couple months ago.
[05:23.65]Less than a month.
[05:24.27]Like a month ago.
[05:24.85]And it was fine.
[05:25.41]It was all normal.
[05:27.17]So I wonder if this is something just brand new.
[05:29.72]But we'll see.
[05:31.06]He's fine.
[05:31.54]He's happy.
[05:31.96]He's just... It needs to be addressed.
[05:35.04]It needs to be looked into.
[05:36.42]So I decided, you know what?
[05:38.22]If I'm going to take him probably tomorrow, then I'm going to stream today.
[05:43.90]So I'm going to be taking him to the vet tomorrow.
[05:50.25]You're a good dog dad.
[05:51.47]He's like the best.
[05:59.01]Everybody... Everybody's a good dog dad, okay?
[06:04.31]There are personal... There are like personal best friends.
[06:08.05]That's how I see Otto.
[06:11.36]Otto's just like a... He's just a best friend.
[06:13.34]It's just... There you go.
[06:14.16]There he is.
[06:19.51]Yeah, everybody's dog is their best friend.
[06:22.53]And I don't believe anybody that says otherwise.
[06:23.85]Says it in the goddamn title.
[06:33.54]But you can have human best friends and dog best friends.
[06:39.89]Otto is my BFF.
[06:48.12]But yeah, there's two things for you to know.
[06:50.16]Next stream, I'm going to sound completely different.
[06:54.84]I'm going to be doing some audio testing for the next few streams.
[06:57.44]We'll find a good place where I sound good.
[07:01.31]I might even use the same setup.
[07:02.57]I'm just going to change a bunch of settings.
[07:04.51]But I'm getting some new equipment.
[07:10.07]Jeremy, you're fucked in the head.
[07:11.45]Not going to lie.
[07:12.21]Is that talking about my dog being my BFF?
[07:21.50]I don't think anything I said was too outrageous right there.
[07:25.70]I feel like everything I just said was very, very plain, normal, and very expected.
[07:33.35]That wasn't too crazy, right?
[07:35.51]I don't think so.
[07:36.19]Alright, so here's what we're doing.
[07:38.39]I was gonna play House Flipper Pets DLC, which, I mean, we're talking about dogs, and, you know, cats, and gerbils, and rabbits, and
[07:49.45]Bugs, if you have them.
[07:51.73]But that's not what we're doing today.
[07:53.49]Because I'm starting so late.
[07:55.21]This is an impromptu early reverse delay stream.
[07:58.85]We're going to play Webbed.
[08:00.49]Which, we were just talking about bugs, so.
[08:03.60]Webbed is a game where you play as a spider and spider around.
[08:07.84]And that's what we're going to do.
[08:10.34]So, nothing tomorrow.
[08:14.22]As I take Otto to the vet.
[08:15.32]Sorry for the impromptu schedule change, but here we are.
[08:20.57]We're just going to spider around.
[08:21.51]So the plan, the game plan, is as follows.
[08:29.94]Are you listening?
[08:31.80]Listen up.
[08:34.26]Listen up.
[08:34.68]Attention.
[08:39.24]House Flipper Pets DLC is going to be Saturday and Sunday.
[08:44.70]Because during that same period, we're going to play Blood Wash and Murder House.
[08:50.63]So this weekend, we're gonna do Pets DLC.
[08:53.99]Murder House and Blood Wash.
[08:54.91]Not sure which day they could flip back and forth.
[08:59.49]What's the plan going forward here?
[09:06.60]Oh, brother, this guy stinks.
[09:11.34]What was that?
[09:17.00]If you had a movie made about you, who would play you?
[09:20.08]Me.
[09:23.15]Is that really a question?
[09:24.23]Me.
[09:25.47]I would play me.
[09:33.46]But do you mean... Because I'm 36.
[09:39.28]What time period does this movie take place?
[09:41.89]When I'm older?
[09:43.19]When I'm still young?
[09:44.57]Younger?
[09:45.69]What is this movie about?
[09:48.59]Because everyone's saying, oh, it would be Willem Dafoe.
[09:51.53]But Willem Dafoe's a lot older than me.
[09:54.00]Five years from now in the future.
[09:55.48]Could be Steve Buscemi?
[10:02.02]I could see it.
[10:04.36]I am still young.
[10:07.46]I'm young.
[10:09.57]I'm still young.
[10:10.49]I'm still young.
[10:15.67]I think when I turn 38 is when I'm just going to be able to say, I'm not young anymore.
[10:23.26]Although I did fall out of the 18 to 34 bracket, drop-down bracket, for how old you are.
[10:32.75]That's true.
[10:34.53]Old is 46.
[10:35.33]I think old is 40.
[10:36.07]Old is definitely 40.
[10:39.11]It's 40.
[10:41.78]You can't say I'm young.
[10:43.58]Oh yeah, I'm just a young guy.
[10:45.84]When you're 40.
[10:47.18]No, you're 40.
[10:50.32]I think 30... I think 40 is the new 30, though.
[10:55.04]People are living a lot longer.
[10:56.00]People are living to be in their 90s.
[11:01.31]Aren't you 46 or 36? 36.
[11:14.16]Aren't you 40?
[11:15.08]Um, no.
[11:15.82]Well, I'm almost.
[11:16.76]40 is midlife.
[11:18.86]Crisis.
[11:19.38]Midlife.
[11:19.82]No, it's not.
[11:28.45]Is it?
[11:29.13]Yeah, it is.
[11:31.63]But, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:32.87]You guys can't tell me that I, if I, when I turn 40, you guys can't tell me I'm having a midlife crisis if I act like a weirdo.
[11:40.82]Or if I do something strange.
[11:43.84]I've been having, I've been doing that all kind of strange shit since I was fucking in my 20s, right?
[11:49.56]Thought, you guys can't say, oh dude, look at him, he's being so weird, he's having a, he's having a midlife crisis.
[11:57.47]I did that stuff like 10 years ago too, right?
[12:00.43]I'm just, that's just who I am at this point.
[12:02.87]But don't say that.
[12:03.45]It would make me feel incredibly poorly.
[12:05.25]36 plus 36 is 72.
[12:08.94]Yeah, and people are living to be 100.
[12:16.03]People are living to be 100!
[12:25.18]50 is midlife crisis.
[12:26.36]Alright, you guys ready to play?
[12:31.30]Let's play.
[12:32.46]This is Webbed.
[12:34.30]The game is called Webbed.
[12:38.47]It looks pretty cute.
[12:41.50]Is this a controller game, or should I play with my, um, hands?
[12:44.54]Is this a hands game, or is this a... Well, you don't even need a mouse.
[12:47.94]Should I play with my hand, or should I use my thumbs?
[12:50.32]That's what I'm trying to say.
[12:53.07]Hands, or thumbs?
[12:59.61]I think this is a hands game.
[13:00.57]Because you have to aim.
[13:02.07]That's a kind of scary sound.
[13:12.44]You know what reminds me of, okay, you know when a hummingbird flies next to your head and you feel like it's a gigantic, huge, scary insect?
[13:20.26]And you go, and you freak out, you scream, and you run, and you kind of move your hands around?
[13:24.42]And then afterwards you realize that you were blessed by a hummingbird and you go, oh no, come back, I'll stand still.
[13:33.73]Like, no, it's already gone, man.
[13:37.31]You fucked it up.
[13:43.20]Is this what you want?
[13:43.70]You want this?
[13:46.85]That doesn't happen.
[13:47.55]Yes, it does!
[13:48.43]Spacecam Andy?
[13:51.25]I want you to crank your compressor up as high as it will go and do one radio host joke next stream, please.
[14:02.47]Maybe.
[14:04.81]You've changed.
[14:06.52]Yeah, I'm sure I have.
[14:08.64]You guys have seen me go from a guy in his
[14:12.57]early to mid-20s to a guy in his mid to late 30s.
[14:16.91]You've seen it in real time.
[14:17.99]Some of you guys that have been here for 10 years, 12 years.
[14:20.63]Of course I've changed, probably.
[14:21.93]Hopefully for the better.
[14:23.47]I hope for the better.
[14:26.25]I've changed physically.
[14:27.83]I've changed probably a little bit mentally.
[14:31.35]What are you talking about?
[14:33.23]12 years have gone by.
[14:33.93]I feel young, man.
[14:39.12]You've changed.
[14:42.35]You look chiseled.
[14:43.45]No, I don't.
[14:44.49]No, I really don't, actually, today.
[14:46.15]I'm not even any... No, I do not.
[14:48.37]I do not look chiseled.
[14:52.20]You guys, no, I don't.
[14:54.40]I'm looking at it right now.
[14:57.72]I'm looking at the screen over here.
[15:00.84]No, I don't.
[15:02.28]I look kind of... I look like clay.
[15:05.18]Clay.
[15:07.11]Can you chisel clay?
[15:08.17]I don't think so.
[15:09.75]Yeah, you can after you cook it.
[15:11.93]That's not a zit.
[15:13.55]What is that?
[15:15.53]What is that?
[15:15.87]Is it like a clump of hairs?
[15:20.05]What is this?
[15:24.41]What is that?
[15:25.27]Did I not shave there somehow last time?
[15:29.54]What is that?
[15:29.92]I have no idea what that is.
[15:37.44]See what I'm talking about?
[15:40.48]You have dents.
[15:43.32]Yeah, I do have a couple of head dents.
[15:49.38]I do have a big dent in my head.
[15:52.82]Whatever, when you get to be 30, you don't give a shit about a head dent.
[15:55.22]Who cares?
[15:56.92]I don't care about a head dent.
[15:59.62]I'm too old.
[16:03.56]Guys, I used to...
[16:06.40]10 years ago, I'd be in the mirror, uh, and I'd, every, every, I would sit there for 10 straight minutes and just be like, I don't, I don't fucking care anymore.
[16:20.80]Like, I, I care, I care enough.
[16:24.06]I care enough to, I don't want to look like shit every day, right?
[16:26.42]But, I mean, I'm not sitting in the mirror farting individual strands of hair.
[16:34.58]I mean, this is just what I look like.
[16:36.58]And for 40, I look pretty damn good for 40.
[16:40.40]I'm sorry.
[16:41.02]You have to give yourself a little bit of credit sometimes.
[16:43.54]I look pretty fucking good for 40.
[16:45.94]I think I've been drinking a lot of green tea.
[16:49.02]I've been drinking a lot of, uh, excuse me, water.
[17:01.47]No tea today.
[17:03.58]Because I ran out.
[17:04.20]I drank it so much that there's no more.
[17:08.52]I didn't get any more.
[17:09.22]Play the game?
[17:17.27]I'm just... It's been 10 minutes, man.
[17:22.95]Stalling.
[17:23.49]I'm... Yeah, I'm just hanging out.
[17:26.47]You guys can chill.
[17:27.53]Just chill for a second.
[17:30.17]How did you run out of tea?
[17:31.23]Because I drink... I drink so much of it.
[17:33.65]I've been drinking... I've been trying a bunch of things.
[17:35.99]I've got a few that I really like.
[17:41.27]I have these, like, green tea, like, energy packets.
[17:44.44]I've got green tea powder.
[17:45.64]I've got... Dude, I'm going to have green tea souvenir merchandise and shit eventually.
[17:51.06]And then I take care of my skin, too.
[17:54.18]Uh, Moisturize?
[17:56.38]Developers like to acknowledge the Jagera, Turbul, and Gubi Gubi peoples as the traditional owners of the lands on which WEBS is based on?
[18:05.46]Holy shit, what the hell is that?
[18:14.37]That feels kind of good, to do that.
[18:15.77]Hold Q to dance.
[18:26.81]Okay, spaces jump?
[18:29.87]Hold that to grapple to a point.
[18:31.73]Oh shit, okay.
[18:38.89]That's kind of fun.
[18:39.45]Can I, um, descend down?
[18:51.58]Okay, let's keep going.
[18:53.45]Aim at a point and hold right click to go to two sparts spinning a web.
[19:00.77]Now aim at a second point and release to build a bridge.
[19:05.51]Wait, what?
[19:09.65]Whoa.
[19:11.60]Okay.
[19:18.16]Oh, you can connect them!
[19:20.39]I can spin a web.
[19:22.71]Alright.
[19:25.25]Why is Jared Leto playing webbed?
[19:28.11]I don't look anything like Jared Leto at all.
[19:31.24]It's zero.
[19:32.78]It is zero resemblance.
[19:34.68]Zero.
[19:36.56]If you put both of our faces in a scanning machine, we would have a fucking 12% compatibility.
[19:43.85]I don't know what you're talking about.
[19:45.19]What happened?
[19:48.64]Okay, so we gotta go like this.
[19:50.82]Oh, this is mud.
[19:51.44]Can I not grab mud?
[19:53.46]From here to here?
[20:00.36]Is this like Jump King?
[20:01.42]Am I gonna get mad at this game?
[20:06.50]I'm probably- I'm gonna be pissed at this game, right?
[20:10.26]Is this game that's gonna piss me off?
[20:24.67]12%.
[20:35.70]Holy shit.
[20:40.90]Shoot lasers?
[20:47.13]Uh, okay.
[20:47.81]This is weird.
[20:51.95]Oh no.
[20:54.43]Why do I have lasers?
[20:59.98]What?
[21:03.81]OK, well, that's kind of cool.
[21:05.29]Hey, buddy.
[21:09.50]I'm so sorry, I saw what happened to your boyfriend.
[21:11.70]That big mean bird has been menacing the land below its sky for years.
[21:19.31]It devoured many of my siblings, but I think it has something else in mind for your bow.
[21:25.04]The bird loves to collect blue gems, you see, and that love of yours is the shiniest blue I've ever seen.
[21:31.66]Come by my old nest, little buddy, I might have an idea.
[21:40.11]Okay, so this big ball of silk may not look like much, but it was my home for a time.
[21:44.87]The ants below have approached me with reckless plans to turn it into a heated airship as part of their defense effort.
[21:51.69]I've not let them try it so far, but perhaps a little recklessness is what we need right now.
[21:55.43]Did anybody else love ants because of the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids movie?
[22:03.31]People are like, oh, ants, gross.
[22:04.51]Actually, I like ants.
[22:06.85]In Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, an ant saves all the kids.
[22:10.95]It defends them against a giant scorpion.
[22:13.75]And it's ante.
[22:15.29]They're good friends, and it protects them.
[22:17.13]And I remember watching that and going, ants are good.
[22:19.27]I like ants.
[22:19.85]They're good friends.
[22:22.01]I like ants because of that.
[22:25.03]Okay.
[22:26.09]Don't need some fuel, too, of course.
[22:27.43]I'd look to the dung beetles on the hill for that.
[22:29.56]And naturally, a guide is important for any adventure.
[22:33.76]Perhaps a bee.
[22:34.60]Nobody knows these skies better than them.
[22:36.20]Alright.
[22:37.99]Yes, this is a good plan.
[22:39.71]Go on little buddy, there's no time to waste.
[22:41.43]Get out there, make some friends, and save your love.
[22:48.96]Movement's clean.
[22:55.59]Is that fall damage?
[22:56.23]What's that?
[23:00.15]Can I grab that?
[23:03.93]What is it?
[23:05.33]I found... I got a little spider friend!
[23:08.65]Okay, I gotta go to the ants.
[23:14.61]Oh!
[23:15.23]What happens if I get more?
[23:16.04]How many of these should I get?
[23:21.00]Oh shit.
[23:24.28]Is there fall damage?
[23:36.39]The ninja rope.
[23:42.78]Who's that?
[23:48.20]Oh, I'm giving up my... Oh, these are babies!
[23:51.36]You don't weigh enough for fall damage.
[23:53.22]New Spider-Man game looks pretty good.
[23:55.26]There's no fall damage, okay.
[23:58.33]Thank you so much.
[23:59.63]These little ones ballooned off when that big bird flew by.
[24:03.21]But they're far too young to be off on their own.
[24:04.81]If you find the others, please bring them back to me.
[24:07.35]I like birds.
[24:08.31]I like crows.
[24:11.00]With 40, I could bring all 40.
[24:13.14]I like crows.
[24:17.70]You know that... Did you guys know that crows are the most intelligent fucking animal?
[24:23.95]Did you guys know that?
[24:31.67]Okay, I need to find an ant.
[24:38.88]Can't get up there.
[24:39.52]Is this like a Metroidvania?
[24:43.08]Do I have to go get like boots or something?
[24:54.38]I really do like the movement a lot though, it's fun.
[25:03.01]Where are these ants?
[25:05.31]Who asked, nerd?
[25:06.27]Fuck.
[25:12.28]Who was that?
[25:12.80]Okay, I gotta get over there.
[25:13.92]There's a fly over there.
[25:16.44]I heckin' love small spiders.
[25:24.95]Stop.
[25:25.95]Whatever.
[25:34.41]Okay, I gotta get up here.
[25:38.73]So that fly is over there.
[25:39.79]Can I, like, go like this?
[25:47.30]Oh, shit, okay.
[25:51.78]Oh!
[25:56.22]Ah, alright, that's how you- that's what we're supposed to do.
[26:04.38]What are you doing?
[26:07.82]Fuck.
[26:22.43]Okay, get back up here.
[26:25.15]So if I go from here... He should be right here.
[26:29.68]Ooh, I got it!
[26:32.68]There we go.
[26:33.10]Alright, what do you want?
[26:34.82]Kill the predator.
[26:35.72]I am the fly lord.
[26:37.38]Your fangs are too small to devour me.
[26:40.60]If my kin don't sit well in your stomach, come pay me a visit.
[26:43.37]Let's see what we can do about that.
[26:48.23]You haven't eaten even a single fly?
[26:50.47]Perhaps I judged you too harshly.
[26:52.27]Be on your way, spider, and stay away from temptation.
[26:56.37]Platformer Andy?
[27:01.84]What's up here?
[27:12.55]Oh!
[27:13.87]This is back where I was.
[27:14.83]This is where the, uh... Alright, back over here.
[27:19.27]Tab for map?
[27:24.15]Where?
[27:26.23]What the fuck?
[27:27.01]Okay, I'm in... I'm at the... Okay, I gotta go down there to go to the ant world.
[27:31.59]How do I get... How do I go there?
[27:39.53]Where is it?
[27:42.47]Jumping spiders.
[27:43.37]I heckin' love jumping spiders.
[27:52.88]Oh, here we go!
[27:53.40]Alright, I got it.
[27:56.78]Ant kingdom.
[27:57.42]Greetings, comrade spider.
[27:58.69]I hear you've got some problems that could use an ant solution.
[28:02.69]We'd love to help out, but we're still recovering from the latest fire ant raid.
[28:07.88]The workers could really use some extra help down there if you've got time.
[28:10.83]Alright, speak with comrade Carl in the mech ant chamber.
[28:14.55]We'll be able to give you some work, okay?
[28:27.76]Turn that on?
[28:31.06]Who's burped?
[28:32.68]What's this?
[28:33.08]Can I dig?
[28:38.36]Hey, can spiders dig?
[28:39.22]Okay, what's the job?
[28:44.75]Help with the elevator?
[28:45.43]It's been broken down since the attack, but I can't reach the part we need to fix it.
[28:49.15]If you can get me the brass cog from the other side of this chamber, we should be able to get it running.
[28:54.12]Without that elevator, we're stuck up here.
[28:56.04]Alright, fix the elevator.
[28:57.64]Fucking easy.
[28:59.40]Alright, this is where you start to die.
[29:10.52]Easy.
[29:13.36]Okay, I didn't know you could die in the game.
[29:20.89]What was that?
[29:23.99]Grubs?
[29:24.43]I was supposed to do huge pog.
[29:33.76]Hold on.
[29:38.56]Cog is right there.
[29:46.70]Alright.
[29:47.22]Oh, I actually have to drag it across?
[29:51.18]Oh, that sucks.
[29:51.82]Alright, hold on.
[29:58.41]Should I go down the secret?
[29:59.15]Alright, stay down there for a minute.
[30:07.48]Should I go do the secret?
[30:09.40]What if I get stuck down here?
[30:13.28]Oh, this is a grub.
[30:13.86]Okay, cool.
[30:17.34]I like this game.
[30:20.18]This game's pretty cool.
[30:23.52]So far.
[30:24.64]So far.
[30:25.08]Hold on.
[30:26.50]Relax.
[30:26.85]So far.
[30:32.93]Can I go in the acid?
[30:34.53]Yeah, I just can't.
[30:35.45]Oh, shit.
[30:35.89]Hold on.
[30:49.94]There you go.
[30:51.22]Thanks, Crawford.
[30:51.66]I'll deliver the cog back to the main shaft.
[30:54.19]Just pop it into the gearbox, and we should be good.
[30:56.53]Okay.
[31:02.27]Do I have to do that?
[31:03.05]Do I have to do anything?
[31:11.62]I demand to know what your favorite soup is.
[31:13.34]Fucking cream of broccoli or something, man.
[31:15.88]Like everybody else.
[31:19.64]Hold on, I need to go like this.
[31:21.14]Fuck you!
[31:49.50]There we go.
[31:51.38]He's gonna rage.
[31:52.60]I'm not- I probably won't.
[31:54.18]This game's too cute to be mad at.
[31:56.94]It's way too cute.
[32:00.24]Although I say that now, I'm probably gonna- something's gonna happen.
[32:07.13]Alright, so who do I give those to?
[32:08.47]This is a cute game!
[32:11.81]Is that a door?
[32:17.35]What are you doing?
[32:18.35]I'm... I'm playing... I don't know what I was gonna say.
[32:22.36]Up.
[32:24.36]I'm playing Up.
[32:25.84]Like the movie Up.
[32:28.08]I've never seen Up.
[32:29.62]I just know that there's an old guy.
[32:30.90]And there's a dog.
[32:32.27]And there are balloons.
[32:33.05]I don't know anything about the movie.
[32:36.07]I've never seen it.
[32:40.53]But you know, I feel like I've seen the movie though, right?
[32:42.77]The problem with really popular movies...
[32:45.95]that you haven't seen, is it's almost like you feel like you've seen the entire movie because everybody's talked about every scene.
[32:52.67]So I feel like I've seen it already.
[32:53.92]Can I go down here?
[33:05.24]Watch it now.
[33:05.90]You would like it.
[33:06.56]I know I would.
[33:07.38]I just, I feel like I've already seen it.
[33:15.00]What is this for?
[33:15.58]Oh.
[33:22.94]Hold on.
[33:26.75]You should be arrested because you haven't seen it.
[33:31.29]I don't think not seeing up is as outrageous as not seeing Star Wars or something.
[33:36.67]Or Lord of the Rings.
[33:39.29]No, I've never seen the Lord of the Rings.
[33:40.63]Wait, is this a shortcut?
[33:43.79]That is.
[33:44.09]What else is there?
[33:47.03]Why is there a shortcut?
[33:52.29]You're gonna cry.
[33:52.93]You should watch it with Holly.
[33:53.83]You're gonna cry.
[34:00.38]Comrade Mark recruit you from the surface?
[34:04.54]Fantastic.
[34:05.30]There's tons of work to do.
[34:06.62]Finish the mech ant.
[34:08.42]Let's see.
[34:08.98]The mandibles need a final heat treatment up in the forage room.
[34:11.79]About to turn that back on.
[34:14.03]We need to patch up the pipeworks.
[34:15.53]Okay.
[34:17.59]We'll need that to supply the mech ant.
[34:19.73]Oh, and it still needs three more legs to be attached.
[34:22.36]Oh, God.
[34:23.64]I think we're waiting on... This thing's crushing me!
[34:27.93]That was bad.
[34:28.95]It seemed kind of dangerous.
[34:31.08]Uh, I think we're waiting on deliveries for two of them from engineering.
[34:33.90]What are you waiting for, comrade?
[34:37.04]Get to it.
[34:37.46]Okay, so I need to get parts for this.
[34:45.40]I need mech ant legs, water pipes, and propellant pipes.
[34:48.18]And mandibles.
[34:50.04]Where am I supposed to find this shit?
[34:55.34]What's this?
[34:56.48]Living quarters.
[34:57.22]Alright.
[34:57.62]I gotta find eggs?
[35:01.74]Why don't I shoot somebody with a laser?
[35:02.70]Oh, here we go.
[35:03.02]What does this do?
[35:06.34]Oh, alright.
[35:08.52]That brings it up there.
[35:17.13]MonkaW.
[35:17.71]Why?
[35:18.13]What do you mean MonkaW?
[35:19.07]What?
[35:21.89]Alright, attach this.
[35:25.87]How do I attach it?
[35:26.45]Is this with the mouth?
[35:30.57]How does this work?
[35:45.42]How do I do this?
[35:46.68]Looks like a leg.
[35:47.34]Yeah, it does, but how do I move it?
[35:49.88]Oh shit!
[35:50.28]Okay, I have to snap it in place.
[35:51.60]Okay.
[35:53.44]Bob, what?
[35:53.86]Alright, I need two more legs.
[35:57.88]What's your favorite bug?
[35:58.62]Um... What's that fate?
[36:03.67]My favorite bug is probably... I don't know.
[36:11.21]I love the ball so much, and I can't decide.
[36:13.45]Um, I can't... Is it stuck here?
[36:27.59]Probably a honeybee.
[36:29.57]Honeybees are probably just fucking distracting me.
[36:33.55]And it's pissing me off.
[36:34.41]I don't care.
[36:36.13]You know what?
[36:43.18]No, it's honeybee.
[36:44.90]Honeybees are, they make this delicious goo.
[36:47.78]How could you not like a honeybee?
[36:55.09]I'm supposed to wedge that out of there.
[36:57.39]He's so grumpy.
[36:58.41]No, I'm kidding.
[36:59.11]I swear to God.
[37:02.40]Earwigs?
[37:03.90]I don't mind earwigs.
[37:04.70]I think they're fine.
[37:08.88]How do I get this out?
[37:15.00]Out through there?
[37:19.83]Earwigs are the worst.
[37:21.75]They really aren't, though.
[37:23.97]What do they do that's so bad?
[37:26.71]What does an earwig do that's so bad?
[37:31.07]Nothing.
[37:31.41]They just kind of exist.
[37:32.71]What's wrong?
[37:37.24]Mosquitoes are probably the worst insect, without a doubt.
[37:40.02]And ticks.
[37:41.12]Mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas, probably, right?
[37:47.30]Let's go like this.
[37:53.87]All the biting insects.
[37:54.83]Fuck that.
[37:58.07]Can I not pull this guy out?
[38:01.93]Yeah, mosquitoes are the worst.
[38:02.77]There's no benefit at all for a mosquito.
[38:05.93]They just cause problems.
[38:07.32]They just cause problems only.
[38:08.96]Hmm.
[38:18.88]What about the leech?
[38:21.45]Yeah, but the leech had some medical... ...backing, right?
[38:28.14]Weren't leeches... didn't they have a purpose?
[38:31.02]What the fuck?
[38:32.93]A leech is not a bug though.
[38:33.95]Yeah, that's true.
[38:59.35]You stupid goddamn... Alright, I'm fine.
[39:06.83]I'm just trying to rush.
[39:07.51]I have to stop.
[39:08.02]Hold on.
[39:12.18]Oh, come on, man.
[39:29.02]So what the hell?
[39:29.56]How do I get... I have to be able to pull these guys out, right?
[39:32.35]Is there a device I get?
[39:43.30]Wait.
[39:45.30]Oh, I got one.
[40:03.37]Um... How do I get this back?
[40:10.71]Wait, will this connect in here?
[40:17.27]Oh shit!
[40:18.15]That's how you do it!
[40:18.71]Alright, so you have to connect them.
[40:20.95]How am I gonna get this back?
[40:25.98]He's so fucking high!
[40:31.76]How do I get it out?
[40:45.58]It's getting called out right now.
[40:46.94]I'm fine.
[40:53.80]Well, let's drag it out.
[40:57.82]Come on, pull it out.
[41:00.86]Yeah!
[41:04.52]Okay.
[41:08.28]Now I need to make a bridge here.
[41:20.93]Not good enough.
[41:22.57]That's better.
[41:24.64]So now I have to... Fuck!
[41:28.78]How am I supposed to do this?
[41:36.66]I gotta pull it up and then turn it?
[41:38.20]How am I gonna...?
[41:44.99]Like that?
[41:57.73]Here we go.
[41:58.11]Alright, now jump it.
[41:59.16]Up this way.
[42:03.92]You look confused.
[42:05.34]I kind of am confused.
[42:07.88]I kind of am confused, man.
[42:10.54]Eat bugs or riot.
[42:15.36]Relax.
[42:19.64]No, fuck you!
[42:50.88]No!
[42:53.30]Oh, it beat it for me.
[42:54.36]Good.
[42:57.44]Oh, there's one.
[42:57.82]Okay, he got it.
[43:03.32]Okay.
[43:04.76]So they transfer it.
[43:05.91]Oh, alright.
[43:07.13]Let me just get a sip of water.
[43:13.50]How many of you guys, with just room temp water, out of a glass, can just badlands chugs that, and it's not a problem?
[43:27.17]Room temp water, out of a, just a room temp glass?
[43:31.99]That's gone.
[43:32.91]It's gone instantly.
[43:33.93]Okay, I need, there's another piece over here.
[43:38.63]What was the other one?
[43:39.76]Is there more than one here?
[43:43.21]I don't think there's more than one, no.
[43:47.81]Yeah, it's easy.
[43:55.38]Ah!
[43:56.15]That's very helpful, actually.
[44:11.21]Okay, so now there's another leg here.
[44:12.97]I gotta connect to this one.
[44:17.00]So I get it.
[44:17.46]Everyone, that was Pepe laughing.
[44:19.86]You're really funny.
[44:20.86]Just for your information, webbed is 10 bucks.
[44:38.03]Wait, do I have to connect this one to that one?
[44:41.94]Is that how this works?
[44:42.58]Is it going to connect to this?
[44:53.75]Do I have to do that?
[44:59.46]No.
[45:01.36]Well, I have to bring it up there.
[45:11.37]I'll take it to the mech.
[45:12.47]Where's the mech from here?
[45:15.45]Up.
[45:16.01]Up right.
[45:16.43]Come here.
[45:23.59]Get over here.
[45:26.55]I screwed up.
[45:27.29]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[45:38.66]Get up!
[45:40.26]Get up!
[45:53.28]Okay, now come here.
[45:54.10]Do bugs have milk?
[46:26.90]GET THIS FUCKING THING UP!
[46:30.55]I don't know, man.
[46:32.17]I don't think- No, what are you talking about?
[46:34.05]Why are you saying such a weird thing?
[46:35.71]Nooo- Whatever, start over.
[46:43.78]Just start the whole fucking thing over.
[47:39.88]Use more than one web, stop being bad.
[47:41.62]Yeah, but I'm trying to pull it up.
[47:56.56]I want it to go up more.
[48:06.34]I want it to go up more.
[48:08.26]How do I get it to go up more?
[48:10.32]Connected at both ends.
[48:18.32]It is on both ends.
[48:27.33]How do I pull it up?
[48:28.61]You need more lines.
[48:33.39]No I don't.
[48:33.95]Look at how many fucking lines there are!
[48:35.82]Put them on the ceiling instead.
[48:46.71]Get up here!
[49:03.20]But go!
[49:07.67]This is for you.
[49:19.95]I think it made it.
[49:20.67]I think.
[49:21.97]Let's go find out.
[49:29.54]Eat bugs.
[49:30.06]Isn't this...
[49:32.74]Shut up!
[49:35.86]How does that sound?
[49:44.11]Alright, look it!
[49:44.55]We got another leg!
[49:46.45]Guys!
[49:48.43]We've got another leg!
[49:58.43]Connect it!
[50:14.16]Okay.
[50:15.90]It's one more leg.
[50:16.74]I have not been down to the lower right.
[50:18.40]Let's figure it out.
[50:30.10]Can't talk right now, sorry.
[50:31.06]Oh, a giant enemy.
[50:44.20]Can you please be a little bit more quiet?
[50:45.38]You almost woke up my dog.
[50:46.32]He needs rest.
[50:51.56]I was supposed to start barking.
[50:54.84]I was about to try to do a real dog bark.
[50:57.64]Realistic dog barking.
[50:58.77]You know what I mean?
[51:03.37]Kind of in the realm of
[51:13.93]really early.
[51:15.61]I caught that one very early.
[51:17.01]I like the song.
[51:19.76]Yeah, the soundtrack's cute.
[51:24.74]Good day, comrade.
[51:26.00]Everyone here is getting really thirsty.
[51:27.82]Ah, me too.
[51:38.63]Do you think you can turn the water back on so we can have a drink?
[51:41.39]Yeah.
[51:47.48]Just drop this somehow.
[51:53.19]No Bark Andy.
[51:56.21]How do I turn that on?
[51:56.83]I don't know, Jeremy, maybe if you played the game you just would figure it out eventually.
[52:03.49]Not have to ask a fake rhetorical question and go like this and wait till somebody says the answer.
[52:15.48]Uh, where am I?
[52:20.73]I need water.
[52:21.27]Oh, boss fight.
[52:26.53]This is a boss fight, I think.
[52:31.33]That's a Mega Man door.
[52:32.45]That's the Mega Man door before the boss, you know what I'm saying?
[52:35.43]This is a Mega Man boss fight door.
[52:38.14]I told you it was.
[52:44.90]I'm always doing a boneless.
[52:47.34]Get it?
[52:52.23]Hey, you skater girl.
[52:54.29]It's me, SkateBurb.
[52:56.86]I'm trying to teach all them ants to skate.
[53:00.10]They got the right attitude, but still working on technique.
[53:04.44]You want to show them how it's done?
[53:06.90]Yes.
[53:07.92]Heck yes.
[53:09.40]Clear to park ants.
[53:11.06]We about to see some sick moves.
[53:15.38]RIP board?
[53:17.71]Release board.
[53:19.23]Grip board.
[53:20.01]Release board.
[53:20.93]Grip board.
[53:21.69]Release board.
[53:22.55]Grip board.
[53:26.34]What?
[53:28.24]W. That was pretty sick.
[53:31.10]What am I supposed to be doing?
[53:43.50]Oh, I have to grip the board and jump?
[53:47.19]I don't know.
[53:47.63]I don't get it.
[54:00.19]What a cool trick.
[54:02.01]What a cool trick that was.
[54:04.17]Okay.
[54:05.63]Um... I can... Oh, I can grab...
[54:16.50]I need to be on the board.
[54:17.14]How do I... Okay, how do I turn... How do I restart?
[54:22.30]I don't know.
[54:24.10]I have no idea where the board is.
[54:30.22]Okay, grip the board.
[55:04.89]Hold on, hold on.
[55:05.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[55:10.35]Where's the B?
[55:10.85]Alright, I got the B. I got BB.
[55:11.81]B!
[55:39.47]Can I grab this and put it back up there?
[55:41.13]There we go.
[55:41.47]Alright.
[55:41.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[55:42.43]Get over there.
[55:54.83]I need another B. I need E.
[56:11.68]God damn it.
[56:12.54]Oh, this way.
[56:18.89]I see.
[56:19.19]Alright, I gotta go this way and then come down there.
[56:21.65]Alright, check it out.
[56:22.41]Here we go.
[56:28.65]Come on!
[56:29.42]What the fuck?
[56:31.54]Use webs?
[56:32.10]I can't use webs.
[56:32.72]It pulls me off the board.
[56:35.24]Does it?
[56:40.15]Yeah, I can't.
[56:40.73]If I use a weapon, it takes me off the board.
[56:44.90]Oh.
[57:09.43]I was pretty sick.
[57:11.15]Alright, I gotta go up.
[57:14.37]I need E. I need an E and a B and I'm done.
[57:27.22]My head just got caved in.
[57:30.82]Where's the last B?
[57:33.21]Right there.
[57:38.56]I wasn't supposed to do this in a certain time limit, was I?
[57:44.59]Hope not.
[57:54.63]Hey skater girl, you ready to skate?
[57:57.47]No no no no no no, I don't want to skate anymore.
[58:01.80]I already did it.
[58:13.14]I can just leave?
[58:14.20]Did I get a skateboard as a present?
[58:19.85]Where am I?
[58:20.83]All the way over here.
[58:23.87]I named my dog.
[58:25.45]Please bark back to my dog.
[58:31.42]No, I'm not going to bark at your dog.
[58:34.12]Because me barking at your dog is an embarrassment for me.
[58:40.74]I'm not barking.
[58:48.77]I'm way too far away.
[58:49.69]I gotta go back to the ant kingdom.
[58:50.67]Is the music too annoying?
[58:53.83]Or anything?
[58:55.27]Alright, I need to go... I can't get- I gotta go up to where the mech is, and then right, and then down.
[59:02.56]Right?
[59:05.56]I think so.
[59:12.62]Will you please just bark, please?
[59:14.00]Oh my god.
[59:14.64]Okay.
[59:20.85]Fine.
[59:23.91]Is that what you want to hear?
[59:24.71]You want me to... Let's wait.
[59:44.26]Woof. Woof. Woof. Woof. Woof. Woof. Woof. Woof. Woof.
[59:53.87]Is that good?
[60:08.76]The only thing I see is somebody very, very long, long-term viewer, mod, community member who's been around for a fucking decade.
[60:18.86]Just an all lowercase.
[60:22.57]Just wrote... Strange.
[60:37.60]What does it even sound like?
[60:39.04]That sounds weird.
[60:42.42]I actually didn't mean to have that on.
[60:45.67]I kinda wanna keep this on.
[60:48.33]Just like this for a little while.
[60:54.34]How much more different do I actually sound?
[60:55.90]Do I sound even that much more different?
[60:59.20]How absurdly different do I sound?
[61:00.80]Probably a lot, right?
[61:03.88]Probably a lot, if I were to take a quick question.
[61:08.10]I have to play with the audio setup one last time before I get rid of it forever.
[61:12.28]I can't believe I just fucking barked.
[61:14.78]I'm genuinely unhappy about that.
[61:16.28]Like, why did I do that?
[61:17.32]What was the point?
[61:18.08]Like, I don't know why I did that.
[61:20.10]There's like 15,000 people here.
[61:22.71]Four of you were telling me to bark.
[61:25.75]And you said it like 50 times.
[61:26.93]And then finally I was like, I thought that you five people were like a thousand people.
[61:32.45]Because I keep looking over and seeing, dude, you should buy dog likes when dogs bark.
[61:35.62]Bark at my dog.
[61:36.38]I'm like, fine, I'll do it, okay?
[61:45.62]It was not 20%.
[61:46.32]It was definitely not.
[61:52.20]Alright, I gotta go try to go right.
[61:53.08]I can't go right from... I need to go this way.
[62:02.15]Please, please say Aaron in the deep voice.
[62:04.03]Oh, man.
[62:12.35]Okay.
[62:13.09]Was there another leg over here that I didn't get?
[62:16.89]How do I get out of here?
[62:21.85]What about- Okay.
[62:33.25]Please do a pull- No!
[62:34.93]I- You just got like your fucked up weird fringe guy voice.
[62:39.11]I just did it.
[62:40.75]I just tried to realistically bark like a dog.
[62:45.33]No, you're not getting any more.
[62:46.47]That's what you're getting.
[62:48.17]That's what you're getting.
[62:49.15]That's what you're getting today.
[62:55.49]No more.
[62:56.01]Okay, wait.
[62:57.79]I need to get water, right?
[62:58.53]Okay, water pump is down.
[63:02.26]Pellet pump is over there.
[63:04.52]And the pump power station.
[63:07.06]Alright, let's go down.
[63:22.83]I need to make a bridge.
[64:26.22]No!
[64:56.82]Oh, a gear has to go there.
[65:02.15]What the hell happened?
[65:07.73]Oh, it's too slippery.
[65:08.59]That's really slippery.
[65:09.61]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[65:14.92]Ow, this mudslide's getting dangerous.
[65:16.68]I was trying to repair this power station to open up access to the pumps, but I slipped and fell.
[65:22.52]Would you lend me a mandible?
[65:26.04]Yeah, how do I get back?
[65:26.62]Can I help you get up there?
[65:31.70]Do I actually have to pull you up?
[65:37.23]No?
[65:43.39]Is that helping?
[65:50.04]Oh, just like the movie Up!
[65:54.89]seen it.
[65:55.55]It's a good movie.
[66:00.33]I'm gonna go up.
[66:00.80]Did that work?
[66:14.04]Thanks for helping me out.
[66:15.38]You're a true friend.
[66:16.20]Now I just need to find a way to fix this gearbox.
[66:19.28]Okay, so I helped.
[66:21.56]I think I have an idea.
[66:25.16]Alright, check this out.
[66:28.12]What if I go like this?
[66:28.83]Not what I wanted to do.
[66:34.23]Can I attach this to the ceiling over there?
[66:36.71]Or should I swing?
[66:37.55]I don't know what to do.
[66:54.40]You're killing him.
[66:55.10]I didn't kill him.
[66:57.02]Oh, I do.
[66:57.38]Maybe if you fall.
[67:05.93]What's with this, like, mouth skin?
[67:07.97]What's happening?
[67:22.34]It called lips.
[67:24.34]I'm telling you, no.
[67:25.22]I have this mouth skin.
[67:26.40]Alright, hold on.
[67:30.02]What if I... Okay, very obviously.
[67:35.11]Will it eventually pull it the other way?
[67:45.66]It will, okay.
[67:49.04]Kind of.
[67:58.09]I need to understand physics, hold on.
[68:05.24]Alright, it's going, it's going, it's going, it's going.
[68:29.62]Alright, got that.
[68:35.36]Got that.
[68:37.04]Okay, now... I gotta pull this.
[68:50.21]And then, alright, this is gonna get pulled over here too.
[68:52.65]So let me get on the other side.
[68:55.15]Like this.
[68:57.93]Oh, stupid.
[69:23.31]What the fuck?
[69:24.99]What?
[69:31.25]What are you talking about?
[69:48.71]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[69:49.73]Do a think.
[69:50.25]Do a think.
[69:57.91]You need to think.
[69:58.57]Hold on.
[70:08.49]Just give me a net so I can not keep falling down.
[70:17.26]I think that's it.
[70:20.08]Here we go, ready?
[70:23.16]See you later.
[70:27.35]Oh!
[70:32.53]Oh!
[70:33.69]I didn't get the grub.
[70:34.45]That's okay.
[70:52.41]I don't want the rock.
[70:53.33]Stop picking the rock up.
[70:54.17]Get out of my way.
[70:55.97]I'm working.
[71:04.06]Dude, seriously, dude, get out of the way.
[71:05.88]Just get out of the way.
[71:07.62]Just get out of the fucking way.
[71:08.74]Get out of the way.
[71:15.67]It's wedged into the middle of the rocks.
[71:23.83]Get out!
[71:24.63]Thank you.
[72:07.63]Hey, I'm doing a cellar spider pattern, okay?
[72:10.11]They're the most intelligent of all the spiders.
[72:13.03]You know why?
[72:13.61]Because they don't do this symmetrical web, they do this mess of a fucking web, because it catches more shit.
[72:20.74]The symmetrical, pretty design- no, cellar spiders understand what they're doing.
[72:26.14]They do an incredibly messy design, it catches way more shit.
[72:42.63]Get over here.
[72:48.41]Finally.
[72:48.85]Now extract it.
[72:53.00]We're good.
[72:56.04]Can somebody fact check that?
[72:57.06]No, no, no, you can.
[72:57.74]Absolutely.
[72:58.10]Please do.
[72:59.78]Cellar Spider has an incredibly erratic design because it catches more stuff.
[73:23.34]Now what?
[73:26.68]It's true.
[73:28.54]Cellar spiders construct loose, haphazard webs, often in corners, to catch insect prey.
[73:34.28]They hang upside down on the web until a food item gets tangled.
[73:37.00]Once prey is captured, a cellar spider vigorously shakes their webs to further entangle their meal.
[73:41.46]That's what I'm saying.
[73:45.04]Can everyone hear this telling me that I'm not a scientist?
[73:49.76]Go get the grub.
[73:50.92]I don't think I can.
[73:51.76]I'll try.
[74:07.92]Cellar spiders are really good for you.
[74:08.96]They're just terrifying looking.
[74:11.86]Cellar spiders are really strange looking.
[74:15.97]They're kind of like these white, yellowy, wispy looking... They have really long legs.
[74:22.81]They're really strange looking.
[74:23.95]And why...
[74:44.75]Oh, you piece of shit.
[74:53.10]It's not enough!
[75:18.39]Alright, I'm just trying to rush.
[75:19.53]Just stop rushing.
[75:20.33]That should do it.
[75:24.76]Take that.
[75:33.49]One, two.
[75:34.61]Okay, there's one.
[75:49.22]Alright, there it is.
[76:01.84]How am I supposed to do that?
[76:14.06]Everything's in place, it's fine.
[76:19.59]I have to grab into there.
[76:20.89]That's gonna be actually, that's pretty hard to get.
[76:22.69]I have to shoot into there and down.
[76:25.03]That's gonna be hard.
[76:52.40]Okay, so I powered the station up.
[76:58.39]Very cool.
[77:01.97]Now this is the gas station.
[77:03.37]Do I go this way?
[77:09.17]So I got power, and now I need fuel.
[77:15.64]What other dumb bullshit do I have to do here?
[77:20.88]Take another grub, that's for sure.
[77:34.65]That's gonna be a huge pain in the ass.
[77:37.06]I- my patience is so low.
[77:40.06]It's so low.
[77:41.18]I just- it takes so much for me to- I know what I have to do here, right?
[77:47.69]But the prospect of doing this is like... It's like I can hear fucking colors in my head.
[77:55.40]I just don't want to do it.
[77:56.72]Does anybody else feel that?
[78:00.10]I see the solution.
[78:01.68]Like... Click.
[78:06.97]But my brain is just like... Don't you want to just roll around on the ground?
[78:10.13]Don't you just want to roll around?
[78:10.89]Yeah.
[78:10.99]Yeah.
[78:13.34]I kind of just want to roll around on the ground.
[78:15.58]I don't want to do this.
[78:17.16]I don't want to do this.
[78:20.11]I know what I have to do.
[78:24.79]It's ADHD.
[78:26.05]I know, but still.
[78:27.05]I know what I have to do.
[78:32.81]I think my problem a lot of times... Hold on, I'm going to turn some music down.
[78:39.52]The music's cool, but I can't even hear myself think.
[78:45.68]I think it's because my brain has already seen the solution.
[78:50.49]Puzzle games, to me, get really weird.
[78:53.51]Because I get this puzzle, this big elaborate thing that I need to do, and in my head, I see the solution.
[79:00.91]I've seen it finished.
[79:02.52]And I sit there and I go, I know what that looks like finished.
[79:05.82]It's this process of getting to finishing that that I don't want to do.
[79:11.78]Because I'm a very visual person.
[79:13.85]These two are connected in my brain right now.
[79:15.55]I'm watching it.
[79:16.81]They're connected.
[79:17.95]I'm looking at it right now.
[79:19.21]It's literally a moving video in my head.
[79:21.21]I'm watching it.
[79:21.73]I just don't want to do it.
[79:24.01]He's too smart.
[79:38.62]I don't want to connect these two fucking dryer vents, okay?
[79:41.89]But I know I have to, so I have to do it.
[80:03.32]No!
[80:04.44]Connect to the other one.
[80:21.66]Excuse me?
[80:22.23]Okay, is that one?
[80:38.85]What a shit job.
[81:04.05]Is that wrong?
[81:11.54]Was that... Was that... Was it wrong?
[81:12.90]The one on the... I'm very confused.
[81:22.91]It was not wrong.
[81:24.15]So what the hell's wrong?
[81:50.69]Do it!
[81:51.15]Why would I want to do it?
[82:03.68]They're on.
[82:05.07]They're on, right?
[82:06.91]That definitely looks on.
[82:11.69]They're both connected.
[82:12.33]Okay, they're both on.
[82:17.53]I'll turn the machine on, right?
[82:20.07]Cool.
[82:26.59]Two grubs?
[82:28.07]That's a pretty good deal.
[82:40.85]Where does this go?
[82:44.49]Okay, two of these.
[82:50.85]Awesome down there.
[82:54.04]There's a third cog over there.
[83:02.64]I gotta get them all up there.
[83:03.96]If you're reading this, please sing the victory song.
[83:09.46]Spongebob?
[83:09.92]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[83:27.19]Oh no, I gotta bring it back down here.
[83:39.42]Stay up here!
[83:40.06]Okay.
[83:52.23]You actually have the behavioral patterns of a spider.
[83:58.65]I- You just confused me so much that now I- I didn't get the- Now I- Now I don't?
[84:06.78]How do I have the behavioral patterns of a spider?
[84:10.07]Doesn't make any sense.
[84:17.61]I don't- I'm not a spider?
[84:27.04]I think lizard is more accurate.
[84:33.09]Spiders are too delicate, and they're too calculated.
[84:37.35]Some of my happiest days have been just baking in the sun with my mouth open.
[84:44.51]Lying down on the ground.
[84:46.51]So, I think I'm more of a lizard.
[84:59.86]One.
[85:00.06]Two.
[85:03.49]Let's pull this out.
[85:19.07]Yeah, I would be a lizard.
[85:24.83]And not cool looking either.
[85:25.84]I'll just... Don't fall.
[85:44.96]I'm not going to be a cool looking lizard.
[85:48.99]I would be the lizard that just lie there and just lick their eyes.
[85:56.03]No, I'm not going to even say it.
[86:03.46]And when they run away, they do this thing where they go like this, like... They kind of shake their, like, arms like this.
[86:10.87]And they kind of slide from side to side and shake, shake, shake, shake, shake while they run.
[86:15.81]What is that?
[86:16.19]That's a crested gecko.
[86:24.26]Hmm.
[86:32.91]You're describing a spider.
[86:34.05]That's not a spider.
[86:35.53]No, the reason why you guys think I'm a spider is because of the erratic movements.
[86:44.76]Which I understand.
[86:45.44]I get that aspect of it.
[86:47.68]You know, sometimes you're just looking at a spider.
[86:49.10]They'll just be sitting there and all of a sudden they just go like this.
[86:52.12]They just rip another direction.
[86:55.17]And it's like, holy shit, the thing moves so weirdly and so fast.
[86:58.25]I don't like it.
[86:59.15]A squirrel does that too.
[87:03.93]A squirrel does do that.
[87:07.21]A spider sometimes will be like this, and then two or three seconds later, you'll blink, and it'll glitch, and it'll be turning this way.
[87:17.67]Like that.
[87:18.71]It'll be like this.
[87:20.19]It's really weird.
[87:20.79]Okay, so those are both in there.
[87:28.69]There's one more spot here.
[87:32.79]So that should do it.
[87:38.20]Irma knows about the glitched spiders.
[87:42.38]I mean, spiders are weird.
[87:54.15]Oh.
[88:01.57]My.
[88:03.71]Goodness.
[88:05.75]He's living in a video game.
[88:21.87]Just clear the board.
[88:22.75]Clear the board.
[88:23.33]Clear the board.
[88:23.91]Clear the board and I'll be fine.
[88:27.41]What is it?
[88:27.77]Is it stuck to the ground here?
[88:29.28]What the fuck is going on?
[88:36.08]Please.
[88:36.36]Can I pull this up?
[88:46.11]No, I can't.
[88:46.67]Okay.
[88:47.01]Well, at least I can do this.
[88:52.93]Alright, now dude, seriously.
[88:54.39]Got it!
[88:59.23]Alright, I filled it up.
[89:02.45]There's enough gas.
[89:03.63]I think that's good.
[89:05.75]So now what?
[89:06.19]Now I filled the gas.
[89:10.37]You'd be like a magpie.
[89:13.93]Yeah, I probably would be a bird.
[89:16.18]This is really annoying.
[89:19.28]Constantly yelling non-sequiturs.
[89:25.39]Birds kind of do that.
[89:26.15]I actually would be a bird.
[89:27.35]I'm trying to think of an animal that would randomly, for no reason, just say, they're great!
[89:34.19]Without any context.
[89:35.09]They just say it for no reason.
[89:43.60]Yeah?
[89:43.84]Have you walked into a house with somebody that has birds that talk?
[89:46.48]You're just sitting there, kind of on the couch, and it's just like, they're great!
[89:50.22]Womp womp womp!
[89:55.40]Stupid.
[89:56.82]Oh, you're a pretty bird.
[89:58.22]Oh.
[89:59.56]Who wants a treat?
[90:03.37]Who wants a treat?
[90:06.29]They all do that.
[90:06.87]Look at that.
[90:18.90]It's so creepy because it's always in their voice.
[90:21.82]The voice of the person who owns the bird.
[90:25.01]it's terrifying and it sounds almost a little bit robotic a little bit it's a weird tape recording version of that person saying it it's so strange it's like um it kind of hold on we're gonna take a second here I'm gonna I'm gonna be a weirdo for a minute just in case anyone was trying to chill today so this is work so this is work yeah it works
[90:56.38]Let's pretend I have a bird.
[90:57.44]Wanna just pretend I have a bird back here?
[91:00.88]I got a new bird.
[91:05.26]But weirdly enough, it always sounds... Let's say it's an old lady that has the bird.
[91:11.90]The bird will be doing this whole routine.
[91:17.44]Who's a pretty bird?
[91:19.07]It's like, holy shit, that was like... That was like grandma talking.
[91:25.43]Let's see if I can get this.
[91:30.80]Hold on.
[91:30.96]I'm just going to test it.
[91:32.64]It kind of sounds like this.
[91:35.32]But not this deep here.
[91:37.14]Hold on, let me fix it.
[91:39.88]That sounds kind of correct.
[91:43.68]It's a little better.
[91:44.99]Yeah, it's like this.
[91:46.17]Hold on.
[91:49.39]No, this was better.
[91:51.57]So let's give the bird a few things to say.
[91:52.97]Oh.
[91:55.03]Oh, that was a pretty bird.
[92:03.80]Who wants a kiss?
[92:05.67]Who wants a kiss?
[92:12.65]And it's weird.
[92:14.73]This shit sounds exactly like this.
[92:17.53]I've been in houses with people with birds before and it's just fucking terrifying in a way.
[92:25.08]So imagine that that's literally grandma's voice.
[92:28.78]And you hear shit like this.
[92:51.11]We're gonna be heroes!
[92:57.38]Anybody not gonna go see that fucking movie?
[92:59.56]Ever?
[92:59.76]Okay, here we go.
[93:02.66]There's a bird in the house.
[93:03.40]Oh, there's a pretty bird.
[93:10.99]Oh, there's a pretty bird.
[93:20.58]Who wants a kiss?
[93:22.46]Who wants a kiss?
[93:29.71]Oh, who's a pretty bird?
[93:35.59]Who wants a kiss?
[93:37.47]Who wants a kiss?
[93:40.70]This goes on for 10 to 12 hours straight every day.
[93:47.36]This is scary.
[93:49.16]It's like scary.
[93:58.74]That is scary.
[94:00.38]That is actually really scary.
[94:05.92]You guys know what I'm talking about though, right?
[94:07.42]You guys get it.
[94:08.50]You know what I mean.
[94:09.34]You know what I mean by this, don't you?
[94:12.28]I'm not crazy.
[94:13.99]That's actually what it's like.
[94:15.71]It sounds like a fucking old talkback tape recording version of the person speaking talking.
[94:21.49]It's fucking weird.
[94:23.61]What does it sound like?
[94:24.27]I don't know.
[94:25.05]I'm scared to press it again.
[94:26.01]Oh, I was a pretty bird.
[94:36.43]It's weird, man.
[94:37.67]It's actually fucking weird.
[94:41.07]You're fucked up.
[94:42.43]No, I'm telling you.
[94:47.05]I'm the smart one.
[94:58.28]Reconnect the propellant pipes.
[95:03.61]Okay, so that's done.
[95:05.59]It's impossible for me to get killed.
[95:09.09]I actually don't even know how that killed me.
[95:10.94]It's not even possible to die there.
[95:13.12]Alright, so now I need to put the mandible through the forge, reconnect the water pipes.
[95:26.01]Reconnect the water pipes.
[95:27.63]Where am I?
[95:28.15]I have to go down.
[95:30.59]Down to the lower right.
[95:33.13]Wasn't that where I was before?
[95:34.06]Isn't this the water area down here?
[95:38.06]There's this.
[95:39.66]I forget where to go.
[95:42.22]This looks like a water pipe to me, doesn't it?
[95:50.67]It would be less terrifying without the who wants a kiss muah muah muah.
[96:03.44]But that's what they all say.
[96:04.98]Alright, I gotta focus.
[96:08.28]Leave me alone.
[96:12.52]We need to go this way and then down.
[96:26.41]What do I do with the grubs again?
[96:27.53]I have a ton of them.
[96:36.00]Who is kissing birds?
[96:38.98]I don't know.
[96:40.19]People that have birds, they lean in and they... Right?
[96:44.19]I think so.
[96:47.93]What are you talking about?
[96:51.58]Oh, this is how I get down here.
[96:52.80]This thing's operational again.
[96:56.78]People don't do that.
[96:59.58]I'm telling you they do.
[97:13.18]Is this a sandwich?
[97:18.49]Alright, weigh that down.
[97:20.97]Yeah, they do.
[97:27.15]Perfect.
[97:27.47]Okay.
[97:30.07]Looks good.
[97:31.69]Oh, it just sounds like a Disney movie.
[97:37.77]Disney Pixar's Webbed!
[97:40.17]In theaters May 20th.
[97:46.03]That sounds like a Disney movie name.
[97:49.67]It kinda does.
[97:50.89]This game's cute though, I like it.
[97:59.04]Rock?
[98:07.09]Too heavy?
[98:08.91]Is it too heavy?
[98:12.75]Oh, I think that's heavy.
[98:13.95]I think it's a little too heavy.
[98:17.82]No, maybe not.
[98:24.98]I'm panicking right now.
[98:30.06]There it is.
[98:30.34]Okay.
[98:34.63]What does that get me?
[98:41.70]Have you heard of lyrebirds?
[98:42.74]They can perfectly emulate chainsaw sounds.
[98:45.42]Yeah.
[98:47.42]They're just tape recorders.
[98:48.48]They're strange tape recorders.
[98:49.80]I feel like I'm going to have to bring another one of these down here.
[98:53.98]Maybe not.
[99:19.51]Nice.
[99:23.15]Holy shit!
[99:24.23]I was supposed to die there.
[99:25.13]I went in for one second.
[99:30.38]Whee!
[99:31.00]Alright.
[99:31.96]What do I need to do down here?
[99:34.50]The wheel?
[99:46.00]Alright, first of all, do this so I don't fall in.
[100:03.29]Yikes!
[100:06.33]Is that?
[100:06.80]Okay, put it in.
[100:09.25]Oh, you fixed the drawbridge already.
[100:11.61]Outstanding work.
[100:12.83]Now that the rest of the colony can get through, we can start fixing this place up.
[100:16.21]I want you to turn it on.
[100:23.98]Oh, that's where the bridge is.
[100:25.02]Auto.
[100:26.26]Is there anything else up here?
[100:43.99]I don't think there's anything I can do up here.
[100:48.23]I'd have to connect- I have to do the water pump thing, don't I?
[100:50.41]Or did I already do that?
[100:51.53]That connects to here.
[100:59.20]It wants me to go this way.
[101:05.56]Can you bark again?
[101:17.95]What's the spider language?
[101:19.07]This.
[101:25.99]Okay, so I need... What do I need to do?
[101:28.93]I need another ant leg.
[101:30.95]Reconnect the water pipes.
[101:33.57]Why do I do that?
[101:38.89]It said down here.
[101:40.03]Water pipes.
[101:40.49]Remember?
[101:40.73]I'm just going back this way.
[101:44.57]I'm going this way.
[101:50.92]Can you make some bird sounds?
[101:53.36]Probably.
[101:53.72]I have a- I have a fiver page if you want to pay for it.
[102:00.66]Uh, the base is- it's one- for five dollars you get to do one bird impression.
[102:11.94]It's about ten seconds.
[102:13.86]Twenty dollars will get you two- will get you three birds of your choice.
[102:18.08]And then fifty dollars gets you ten birds of your choice.
[102:22.42]And I have a list of all the birds that I can do.
[102:25.34]They range from cockatoo to chickadee to hummingbird.
[102:34.16]You can pick from a list if you wanted just a little sample.
[102:38.88]I can give that to you just for a demo for anyone that was interested.
[102:41.26]$60, yeah.
[102:52.49]It's really good for background songs, background noise, sampling.
[102:57.73]I've had a lot of people contact me over the first 10 seconds of songs.
[103:03.48]Whether it be rock or rap music, whatever.
[103:05.74]Make a big intro.
[103:08.30]Doesn't matter.
[103:12.58]A lot of people use it for a sample.
[103:25.06]Can we get a preview?
[103:25.78]Yeah, I mean, you've probably heard me a few times.
[103:35.67]Actually, it was part of Hank Fuck's last album.
[103:41.79]It was featured a few times.
[103:42.87]Actually, he did the $50 tier.
[103:53.49]If you remember, it's a pretty popular song.
[103:54.67]It has, I think, six or seven hundred plays on Spotify.
[104:01.88]The opening is, uh, kind of like an inside, like, echo-y instead of a cavern.
[104:05.80]There's this big, like, explosion sound.
[104:11.67]I think he used it there.
[104:12.47]Because I can kind of hear my, my chickadee, I, it, chickadee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.
[104:18.33]And it, it kind of goes, BOOM!
[104:19.75]And he just goes into his, uh, into his song.
[104:26.12]This was a fun experience.
[104:29.32]Was that way too dank?
[104:30.99]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[104:33.51]I'm sorry.
[104:34.41]I am so sorry if that was that.
[104:35.59]That's why I need a new audio setup.
[104:37.57]I'm gonna get a new audio setup.
[104:39.07]I'm gonna get a brand new setup.
[104:40.86]No more loud sounds.
[104:42.12]I swear to God, I promise.
[104:43.68]My audio's gonna be perfectly, perfectly done.
[104:48.78]That's not gonna happen anymore.
[104:50.39]I promise.
[105:03.00]I'm gonna, the compressor's gonna be perfect, it's gonna be perfect highs, perfect lows.
[105:07.66]The next time I stream, I promise, keep it like this.
[105:09.88]No!
[105:10.86]No, you don't like loud sounds.
[105:12.55]You just say you like loud sounds because you want a loud sound to happen so you can go, oh shit, that probably fucked up somebody's ears.
[105:18.71]Because you think it's funny when somebody else's ears get fucked up.
[105:22.41]No, I don't want any more loud sounds.
[105:25.55]Okay?
[105:26.65]No more loud sounds.
[105:31.75]Here we go, pump is going in.
[105:35.50]You got this.
[105:36.46]Hey, thanks.
[105:36.98]It's gonna be hard to get up there.
[106:15.39]Pump!
[106:15.57]Do I have to weigh it down or is this gonna work?
[106:20.51]Fuck.
[106:22.07]Fucking piece of shit.
[106:24.41]Fucking.
[106:26.53]Oh, I need another one.
[106:27.51]Okay.
[106:27.73]Let's do more.
[106:35.34]What?
[106:40.14]What?
[106:40.38]Why was that rude?
[106:41.04]It was me expressing... Anger.
[106:49.43]Calm down.
[106:49.99]You're in the water?
[107:01.42]Stupid fucking goddamn fucking idiots.
[107:02.98]Fucking goddamn stupid fucking goddamn game.
[107:06.96]Oh, they are here, yeah.
[107:15.68]Oh, is there whoever's on the ghost team?
[107:17.20]He's shut the fuck up right now.
[107:28.56]This is going to be such a pain in the ass.
[107:33.51]Oh, yikes.
[107:34.13]This is going to be hell.
[107:36.41]How am I going to do this?
[107:37.15]I'm going to have to do it one at a time.
[107:38.15]One at a time.
[107:41.25]One at a time.
[107:51.19]Much weight on that one.
[108:01.86]Perfect!
[108:08.44]Isn't this guy supposed to be trying to find sponsors for his streams?
[108:14.59]What?
[108:14.83]Because I said stupid fucking goddamn fucking idiots.
[108:18.45]You can swear and get sponsors.
[108:21.61]Right?
[108:21.81]Should I stop doing that?
[108:30.48]Just not very good ones.
[108:31.80]Not good ones.
[108:41.60]I'll be fine.
[108:43.76]I'll be fine.
[108:52.41]There it is.
[108:53.15]Alright, water pipes reconnected.
[108:55.37]Pumping, going on.
[108:57.37]I hope you don't get any.
[109:02.68]Why not?
[109:03.48]Why?
[109:03.88]You want me to get... Why not?
[109:05.44]Hey, I want them.
[109:08.82]I'm going to get them.
[109:13.62]I'm going to cancel my sponsorship.
[109:21.79]Okay, so I... I think I've been down in the ant place for a long time.
[109:34.50]I need one more ant leg, and I need the ant mouth.
[109:39.81]So how do I, where do I go from here?
[109:48.59]Oh, it's filling the tank.
[109:50.00]Alright, what happens if it goes all the way up?
[109:54.08]Is the door gonna open?
[109:59.96]Oh, cool, alright.
[110:01.12]So now I can leap through here.
[110:04.80]Oh my goodness.
[110:12.40]He's not gonna kill me, right?
[110:15.94]Oh my fucking god!
[110:28.01]Still going?
[110:32.23]Still going?
[110:36.24]Where's the elevator?
[110:36.76]There it is.
[110:47.17]What is this?
[110:47.49]The no talk stream?
[110:48.47]I haven't shut the hell up in 15 straight minutes.
[110:54.53]Okay.
[110:58.19]I need one more leg.
[110:59.30]I did the power.
[111:02.74]I did the gas.
[111:03.66]I did all this.
[111:05.10]Water pipes, propellant pipes.
[111:08.54]Electricity?
[111:09.20]I need another ant leg.
[111:16.62]Down here, maybe?
[111:19.77]Where did I miss an ant leg?
[111:20.95]I need to go up.
[111:42.57]What's this Twitch stream?
[111:43.51]I don't know.
[111:50.90]Whatever.
[111:52.40]So where am I now?
[111:53.86]So this is back to the top of the anthill.
[111:56.44]I don't want to leave the anthill.
[111:59.50]I don't want to leave.
[112:00.14]There's much more to be done.
[112:07.66]Wrong way.
[112:08.20]Yeah.
[112:08.44]Hold on.
[112:09.21]Where do I...
[112:21.30]So going up from here takes me out.
[112:24.30]I need to go left.
[112:28.01]This is not going into the highlight.
[112:35.65]It is.
[112:35.87]Okay, so left from here, I think.
[112:43.18]I'm going to go left.
[112:48.47]Okay, so this is- I gotta hand it down here.
[112:50.17]Have I been over here?
[112:51.86]I don't remember.
[112:59.62]I don't- I have not been over there.
[113:04.64]This is fire.
[113:05.47]So I gotta put the fire out, probably?
[113:19.76]Sock up the water from here?
[113:25.23]Shit.
[113:27.21]You gotta forge the mandible.
[113:31.65]Oh, someone has to give it to me.
[113:33.95]Where do I get it?
[113:34.45]Do I have to bring it all the way over here?
[113:38.65]Can't go in there, like Mario.
[113:52.42]Are you ever going to play Yakuza 0 like you promised?
[113:54.62]I know I said it a while ago, but if somebody made a compilation of all the times I have lied on this stream or have not done the thing I said I was going to do, it would be a four and a half to five hour long video.
[114:13.94]So I have to throw a mandible in here to forge it.
[114:17.08]Where do I get it?
[114:24.81]And I imagine it would be done to the music of... what's that overture?
[114:39.81]You'd have to replay that song three or four times.
[114:41.49]Alright, there's one more leg and then the mouth.
[114:49.69]Where is it?
[114:52.52]Down here?
[114:54.45]I'm gonna go there.
[114:55.17]I don't think I've been down there.
[115:02.33]I've been here.
[115:04.14]Yeah, it's right here, but what the fuck?
[115:05.94]How do I get it?
[115:07.44]Where's this piece?
[115:08.82]There's a piece that I haven't found yet.
[115:10.36]No, I wanna go down.
[115:14.40]Okay, that's the 1812 Overture.
[115:20.02]Alright, here we go.
[115:27.21]Thought you were gonna get me.
[115:29.13]Nope.
[115:38.70]Oh my god!
[115:39.56]That just scared the hell out of me.
[115:52.55]You fucking idiot.
[116:06.41]So,
[116:51.65]This fucking rock needs to get out of the way.
[116:55.93]Thank you.
[117:09.79]Interact with us!
[117:10.83]I'm... Look at how much I'm concentrating.
[117:16.23]I'm sorry, if I'm defusing a bomb... What wire do I cut next?
[117:25.75]Dance for us.
[117:27.43]Dance for us.
[117:27.93]You should dance.
[117:30.89]Which why?
[117:31.55]It was a bomb.
[117:33.89]I need to fucking focus.
[117:39.39]We'll chat in just a minute.
[117:40.62]Hold on.
[117:43.30]You just keep failing over and over again.
[117:44.90]Just talk to us.
[117:50.96]Did I fail that time?
[117:51.84]I better still save.
[118:04.08]It's there.
[118:04.52]It's there.
[118:05.66]I'm fine.
[118:06.30]Okay.
[118:22.29]Looks good.
[118:23.15]Now I just need... There it is.
[118:33.90]What was I doing?
[118:41.41]What am I doing?
[118:43.73]Seriously.
[118:48.45]We gotta go up.
[119:09.55]Okay.
[119:12.33]No, don't slide.
[119:13.57]Go up.
[119:21.86]And then hand it to you.
[119:22.84]Check this out.
[119:53.40]Fire the gun!
[119:54.30]Oh my fucking god, just- I'm gonna scream.
[119:57.88]I'm so annoyed.
[120:01.56]I just- Oh, I can see the solution.
[120:05.26]I can see it.
[120:06.40]I can feel the solution.
[120:08.18]I just can't do the solution.
[120:23.41]Get the fuck over here!
[120:24.89]Oh my goodness, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[120:27.07]Slow down.
[120:27.53]I can't slow down!
[120:33.11]I see this illusion, it's already done, but my brain is like, do it already!
[120:40.98]He is standing, giving a peace sign, taking a picture with all the webs in the right place.
[120:45.42]And I'm just fucking pissed at him, because he's like, dude, I can see you done!
[120:49.08]I need to get to it!
[120:52.47]Like he said, you took a vacation photo.
[120:56.79]Okay.
[121:03.67]Take this down.
[121:05.83]Here it comes.
[121:06.53]Okay.
[121:08.91]Square one.
[121:10.41]Check it out.
[121:11.97]Slow down.
[121:12.67]Watch this.
[121:13.97]Bridge.
[121:15.11]It was that easy.
[121:16.07]It was seriously, it was that simple.
[121:17.29]I just had to slow down.
[121:22.56]Now that should go back up here.
[121:24.10]I feel like a bug just crawled over my hand.
[121:27.00]Okay, where is it?
[121:34.64]There it is.
[121:34.98]This has to go here.
[121:44.72]Which will drop it.
[121:57.26]And now this goes where?
[122:01.24]Nobody else has picked this up, right?
[122:06.86]Over here?
[122:09.06]Right there.
[122:09.64]So now this comes down.
[122:12.16]It's just a puzzle game with roguelike elements.
[122:35.71]You're moving from point A to point B. Yeah.
[122:37.35]That's accurate.
[122:55.20]Stop sliding.
[123:07.12]Slow down?
[123:07.60]I- I am!
[123:10.91]See?
[123:11.25]He just keeps- his forward momentum keeps going.
[123:14.35]I'm not touching it.
[123:14.93]No, just Burgah Boy technique.
[123:27.98]Done.
[123:30.82]Just fucking Burgah Boy technique.
[123:50.29]Uh, that last one is here, so now I got all the legs.
[124:10.87]Jeremy, you're spending so much fucking time with these ants.
[124:12.81]I mean, there's other shit to do.
[124:15.83]You're spending a lot of time with these fucking ants, dude.
[124:19.69]You've been outside a lot, you're just digging around looking for fucking ants.
[124:22.63]I don't know what is... I'm getting a little concerned about you.
[124:28.96]Get up there!
[124:41.53]Click!
[124:41.83]Alright, good.
[124:42.99]Done.
[124:48.89]Two hours with the ants.
[124:51.03]I think this game's only three hours long.
[124:53.81]I could be wrong, though.
[125:01.98]The mandible through the forge.
[125:03.58]Where is this mandible?
[125:11.17]Here?
[125:11.43]Is it only because I haven't gone?
[125:14.65]But, like, right...
[125:17.82]Right down right down right.
[125:21.50]Left.
[125:28.16]I connect these to connect the pipes to the ants.
[125:31.35]Connect this.
[125:37.69]What do I connected?
[125:39.53]On top.
[125:41.39]Oh look at it goes on top.
[125:43.90]You're right, yeah OK.
[126:01.48]Please attach.
[126:03.32]Please attach.
[126:12.93]Please attach.
[126:13.41]There it is.
[126:20.19]It was attached!
[126:20.91]What the fuck?
[126:25.00]Okay, it's attached.
[126:37.53]Attach why is it not attaching?
[127:07.53]I should have attached by now.
[127:11.75]Why?
[127:17.25]What is with this fucking elephant nose?
[127:19.05]Get over here!
[127:20.00]Attach!
[127:27.90]Attach!
[127:29.74]Attach to the thing!
[127:43.71]It's running?
[127:44.71]I have to attach the oil thing.
[127:46.66]Is it already done?
[127:48.88]It doesn't attach.
[127:50.18]Oh, wait, I had to fuel it.
[127:52.00]Okay, alright, whatever.
[127:53.08]Alright, so I gotta go right.
[127:55.78]I haven't been down here.
[127:58.93]I thought I had to stay on there.
[127:59.81]No, I gotta go up.
[128:13.81]Up and to the right.
[128:14.45]This dude doesn't know what's happening.
[128:18.75]No, not really.
[128:20.17]I'm just here for the ride.
[128:24.13]Okay.
[128:25.17]I have not gone down to the right.
[128:27.33]Where am I now?
[128:30.68]No.
[128:31.84]Down.
[128:37.64]It's left?
[128:38.88]I haven't explored over here.
[128:42.44]There's a question mark over here.
[128:45.22]Down here.
[128:45.54]Where have I not gone?
[128:50.22]Go back to the flame thing.
[128:51.57]Yeah, but I need a mandible.
[128:52.69]Where do I get the mandible?
[128:56.69]Look.
[128:58.13]The giant gas tank says left.
[129:05.58]Yeah, but I need the mandible though.
[129:15.69]The mandible is at the giant flame.
[129:17.10]Did I not pick it up or something?
[129:19.66]Chad is wrong.
[129:26.50]Are they?
[129:31.80]Where am I?
[129:32.28]Okay, I'm kind of going down to the furnace again here.
[129:34.87]Okay, so this is the gas.
[129:41.41]Do I have to go all the way back over here?
[129:44.50]over here?
[129:44.84]I have to go over here, don't I?
[129:46.26]Shit.
[129:49.66]I am lost, yeah.
[129:53.94]Yeah, I'm lost.
[129:54.60]Ugh, just respawn me.
[130:04.00]Just give me a checkpoint.
[130:11.04]I'm just fucking going so fast.
[130:12.42]I can see the solution in my head.
[130:40.31]Okay.
[130:41.67]Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back.
[130:50.52]Go on a home run.
[130:51.92]So now we go over here.
[131:00.92]So where's the mandible?
[131:02.10]How do I open this?
[131:08.13]I can't open this.
[131:11.50]And unless there's something I can do here, I... Can I pull this up or take this with me somehow?
[131:17.06]I can't scoop this up.
[131:22.75]Mm-mm.
[131:28.03]Because there's a big forge over here, but I don't have the mandible.
[131:30.70]If I touch this, I die.
[131:39.62]Jump in the forge?
[131:41.56]Is it below this room?
[131:44.94]I've been in all these rooms already.
[131:48.90]I feel like I need to go all the way left, but... I can't open that door.
[131:54.19]I mean, right here.
[132:00.03]I can't get in there.
[132:03.49]Something weird with this pipe, probably, right?
[132:08.73]Goes down.
[132:09.29]No.
[132:14.59]This is the only place I haven't been, so I kind of feel like it has to be there.
[132:29.81]What?
[132:32.33]Wait, I can just use this?
[132:41.79]That's pretty cool.
[132:43.75]I thought that was a one time thing.
[132:49.11]Alright, so where the hell am I going?
[132:51.84]Find the mandible.
[133:02.19]I must have just missed it somewhere.
[133:09.80]I think I just missed it.
[133:10.78]Just straight up missed it.
[133:12.22]Somehow.
[133:12.52]Because this thing's ready to go.
[133:15.87]I just need the front.
[133:17.09]This is the engineering room.
[133:26.49]This takes me down here.
[133:27.65]Maybe it is over here.
[133:39.38]You passed it?
[133:41.04]Up one.
[133:41.50]Medium left.
[133:42.22]Medium left.
[133:42.72]What do you mean?
[133:44.22]Go left.
[133:44.76]Medium left.
[133:45.30]I went past it.
[133:50.59]Medium left.
[133:53.67]Stop saying that.
[133:54.77]You're breaking the... Okay.
[133:56.17]Yeah.
[133:56.79]I see what you're doing.
[134:01.47]Forge.
[134:05.45]Oh, nice.
[134:05.77]Okay.
[134:06.41]I don't think I did this.
[134:07.75]No, I did.
[134:08.21]No, I didn't.
[134:18.44]There's gotta be grubs up here, right?
[134:24.53]Whoa.
[134:25.33]Do you trust chat with your life?
[134:29.88]No.
[134:33.47]Guys, if there were two doors, because I was doing an IRL stream, and one of the doors was safe.
[134:41.73]It's like a green door and a blue door, right?
[134:45.47]And behind the green door was a room full of fire and flames.
[134:50.33]And if I opened it, I would get engulfed in flames.
[134:53.14]And I would get fucking annihilated.
[134:55.76]And on the right door, the other door was an ice cream party.
[135:00.34]A ton of people in chat would be like, Left door if Pepe left.
[135:03.52]You should pick the left one.
[135:05.01]And it would be like, Oh, left door chat?
[135:06.79]Really?
[135:07.25]Yeah, pick the left one.
[135:10.13]You guys are trying to fucking get me incinerated.
[135:18.36]There'd be people in chat saying like, Guys, no, dude, like you're actually going to incinerate him.
[135:22.60]Like, stop trolling, please.
[135:24.86]And then they would get timed out because they use too many caps.
[135:39.61]I did it.
[135:41.71]I'll heat it up.
[135:45.61]No health.
[135:49.25]No health.
[135:52.25]I would take my hand, I'd put my hand on the door, and they'd be like, hey, this one?
[135:56.10]You guys think it's this one?
[135:58.10]Ah!
[135:59.48]Chat?
[136:01.66]That hurt.
[136:02.22]That kind of hurt my hand.
[136:03.36]It's all red.
[136:04.16]There's a huge red circle.
[136:07.16]And I would look over and it would just be, no, Elf.
[136:09.12]No, Elf.
[136:11.48]Okay, I guess I'm going in.
[136:12.54]Alright, send these mandibles through the forge.
[136:20.25]Novers.
[136:21.57]No, Elf.
[136:24.88]Yeah, and then I would open the door up.
[136:27.82]It would be... There'd be a bunch of, oh my god, D-Face, D-Face, D-Face.
[136:34.34]And then the next day, two or three days later, there'd be people in the chat that would be typing, where is he?
[136:42.04]How come he hasn't streamed in three days?
[136:44.56]Where the fuck is he?
[136:46.58]Excuse me?
[136:47.14]Where's the stream?
[136:49.86]He's late.
[136:51.34]He's supposed to be here.
[136:59.14]Oh, up there.
[137:07.87]Where is he?
[137:13.09]Yeah, people say, like, oh, that stream sucked, by the way.
[137:15.16]Like, that was, like, kind of a dumb stream.
[137:16.70]I wasn't a big fan.
[137:25.60]That was, like, really dangerous.
[137:29.55]He's gonna have some explaining to do when he comes back.
[137:38.94]That was extra.
[137:49.42]Let go!
[137:52.29]Worst stream of the year.
[137:56.89]Oh, I was almost there.
[137:57.71]Alright, stop being a panicking.
[138:30.02]Yes!
[138:31.48]Okay.
[138:33.90]Another hellfire door stream.
[138:35.74]Okay, so I have to send this through the forge.
[138:45.70]Spinning.
[138:52.85]That's spinning.
[138:55.61]Ah, I get it.
[139:12.01]What's wrong?
[139:17.43]Why is everybody freaking out?
[139:28.32]I told him to get new audio equipment.
[139:29.56]I think it might have been an audio problem.
[139:47.76]I'm so impatient.
[139:53.59]I am so impatient.
[139:55.15]I would like Uber Eats a glass of water from fucking down, like, in my downstairs.
[140:00.03]You know what I'm saying?
[140:01.57]I would Uber Eats a glass of fucking water.
[140:05.05]I'm so impatient.
[140:06.51]I'm just so lazy.
[140:07.49]Like, just do it right.
[140:09.21]Just do it right.
[140:09.97]Just do it.
[140:10.63]It's here.
[140:11.19]It's in front of you.
[140:11.67]Just do it.
[140:13.78]That would take longer.
[140:19.63]I know, that's what I'm saying.
[140:20.55]This has taken so much longer because I'm so impatient.
[140:30.13]Okay.
[140:32.93]This over here.
[140:33.58]Hold up.
[140:39.10]If it wasn't so heavy...
[140:49.57]There we go.
[140:50.31]Alright.
[140:50.81]Pull the lever.
[140:53.07]Okay.
[140:54.13]Go.
[140:58.09]Oh, yay.
[140:58.70]Oh, I gotta like this.
[141:27.14]Oh.
[141:34.15]Oh.
[141:36.49]Do it.
[141:38.15]We're so close.
[141:44.39]Just Burgah Boy it again.
[141:45.19]Not a bad idea.
[141:57.59]Did it work?
[141:58.63]Yep.
[142:00.55]Okay, so now this is gonna get grabbed.
[142:05.49]I'll wait for the next rotation.
[142:07.03]Make sure it's only good.
[142:13.72]Oh.
[142:15.34]Took you fucking forever.
[142:16.20]Okay, now let's pass it through the forge.
[142:25.13]Here we go!
[142:29.66]Cool.
[142:31.82]G'day.
[142:32.16]It's all heated up.
[142:33.84]Now we go through here.
[142:35.40]Punch that button.
[142:48.86]Ah, that's how we get over here.
[142:49.64]Cool.
[142:51.18]Now I should have the mandible.
[142:52.36]I think that's pretty much it.
[142:58.73]That looks hot.
[142:59.77]Can I even touch this?
[143:02.07]This probably kills me if I touch it.
[143:07.19]No, it's alright.
[143:08.39]No, it does not.
[143:09.21]It's not alright.
[143:09.79]Am I the only one that can barely hear the music?
[143:13.55]Yeah, it's kind of one single loop.
[143:28.61]But it's a good loop.
[143:29.53]Yeah, it's good.
[143:31.25]Do I have to cool this off?
[143:35.26]I definitely do, don't I?
[143:37.90]Yeah, there's no way I don't have to do that.
[143:48.84]Open the hellfire door.
[143:59.52]Why are you moving this?
[144:02.68]You duck!
[144:03.18]You know what a really great word is?
[144:04.36]Quench.
[144:07.40]Thirst quench.
[144:08.68]Quench is such a great word.
[144:09.64]Pull it.
[144:45.06]There we go.
[144:46.58]Nice and cool by going into the coolant.
[144:50.37]Let's go.
[145:01.47]Hooray!
[145:01.69]Got it.
[145:12.11]There it is.
[145:13.31]Final piece.
[145:13.85]Time to put it back on.
[145:15.31]And then that's it for the ants.
[145:23.22]Now we just gotta bring this down.
[145:24.66]How far down?
[145:29.50]Let me sculpt this out first.
[145:30.62]It's gotta go... here.
[145:35.17]I gotta attach it to this.
[145:36.13]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
[145:41.15]Come on, do it!
[145:44.52]Come on!
[145:47.32]Oh, please.
[145:59.20]Exactly what I wanted.
[146:00.08]Alright, let's get it.
[146:02.10]Mandible attached.
[146:21.23]Shit.
[146:21.91]What?
[146:30.13]Oh, that's not good.
[146:52.31]I'm so mad.
[146:53.63]Okay, let's just go around.
[147:08.78]What the fuck am I gonna do about this?
[147:13.60]Do I have to go all the way around the other side?
[147:28.44]Stop touching that!
[148:07.52]Move!
[148:10.31]He's so focused.
[148:11.29]I don't want to mess this up.
[148:24.12]Alright, attach it up here.
[148:40.80]Got it.
[148:42.72]Hey, looking good, comrade.
[148:44.56]Get over here and let's have a talk.
[148:48.02]It's ready.
[148:48.40]It's fueled up.
[148:52.94]Mission accomplished.
[148:55.76]Kind of sloppy, but I did it.
[148:58.04]It worked out.
[148:59.20]Hold up a second.
[149:00.16]The platoon is moving out.
[149:01.28]Not seen.
[149:12.59]You're in a great stream so far.
[149:13.59]I just joined and I happen to notice that the title says, Be in a Bug.
[149:16.23]I want to let you know that spiders are not bugs.
[149:18.69]They are arachnids.
[149:19.59]So maybe you can change the title to something more appropriate.
[149:21.97]Thanks.
[149:22.21]What a beautiful display.
[149:31.01]Arachnids.
[149:40.57]No, they're aliens.
[149:43.51]They're all aliens.
[149:44.75]Do you guys know that bugs have been around since 500 trillion years or so before the dinosaurs?
[149:49.01]They've been around... They're the most prehistoric creature and they still exist.
[149:58.43]They were mosquitoes back when the T-Rex was in law school.
[150:03.95]You know what I'm saying?
[150:05.55]They've been around for so long and they're still around.
[150:07.89]How did they stick around for so long?
[150:10.23]Alright, send a workforce ahead to help out with your mission on the surface.
[150:13.11]They'll have that balloon up and flying before you know it.
[150:15.84]Dismissed.
[150:17.22]I got it!
[150:19.76]Very cool.
[150:21.98]Okay.
[150:22.70]Find some fuel.
[150:23.76]So let's go to the surface.
[150:28.96]Aliens.
[150:29.30]I don't know.
[150:33.36]They have bugs.
[150:34.42]They have to be aliens.
[150:35.60]Look at them.
[150:36.86]They've been around for 500 trillion years or something.
[150:42.79]Look at the sounds they make.
[150:49.03]Unfrozen T-Rex lawyer.
[150:51.83]Why do I feel like that's a show that is on Adult Swim right now?
[151:02.38]Okay, so now what?
[151:07.26]I need one more grub.
[151:09.16]Oh man, I really do need one more grub.
[151:13.60]But... I don't... I kind of don't care.
[151:16.46]Is that where the fly... I should have handed it to the fly, right?
[151:18.94]Where's the fly?
[151:34.03]Harvey Birdman?
[151:36.76]Harvey Birdman, that's... What is it?
[151:39.12]That's...
[151:44.34]Stephen Colbert, right?
[151:46.50]Stephen Colbert.
[151:47.96]That's the only thing I know of the whole show.
[151:51.32]I remember it being a good show, though.
[151:59.45]Right?
[152:00.79]What, you can fly?
[152:01.57]No, not... I can't.
[152:18.08]You have to take all the air out.
[152:20.76]It's like... No, there was still air in there.
[152:30.39]Look at how cute that is.
[152:36.85]Aha, Stephen Colbert.
[152:39.15]Well, now... Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[152:41.28]We're pivoting.
[152:42.64]We're pivoting, we're pivoting, we're pivoting, we're pivoting, we're pivoting, we're pivoting.
[152:45.82]Pivot!
[152:46.80]It's time for a pivot!
[152:49.11]I'm fucking loud and annoying, I'm sorry.
[152:53.17]Your airship mechanic.
[152:54.89]We're almost ready for the trip of a lifetime.
[152:57.50]Take these blueprints, we've got lots to do.
[152:59.02]Fuel engine patches, moth nest, spider webs.
[153:06.46]Okay.
[153:11.07]Rest of our pre-flight checklist.
[153:12.93]Find a way to patch up the balloon.
[153:14.18]Bees to the east might be able to help with that.
[153:17.68]Find a fuel source.
[153:18.60]Some good concentrated dung would work.
[153:21.52]Find some of the west.
[153:23.58]Attach engine immediately below the mouth of the balloon.
[153:26.71]Cure pilot platform.
[153:27.85]Oh, and I forgot.
[153:28.33]If you run into any trouble, just shoot the work bell and we'll reset everything for you.
[153:31.91]Okay, well I need to get this stuff first.
[153:34.13]There's a lot of shit in this game.
[153:39.93]These ants showed up just ahead of you.
[153:41.89]A quick work of the tree.
[153:42.91]You've been badgering me with designs for ages, but I've not had the courage to let them try it.
[153:48.21]Glad you're helping each other, though.
[153:49.61]Their plans seem solid, even if they're too bold for me.
[153:52.13]Okay.
[153:58.30]So that's to float away?
[153:59.88]I need to find some fuel.
[154:02.38]Where should I go?
[154:05.26]Oh, cute!
[154:14.57]I guess I could go to the west?
[154:15.93]Go to the bees?
[154:17.27]I'm going to go east.
[154:25.30]East.
[154:26.52]Or should I turn in the fly stuff first?
[154:27.74]Which is somewhere over here.
[154:34.20]Where's the fly?
[154:38.06]Where is he?
[154:38.46]Where is he?
[154:39.48]Because I have a ton of those grubs, don't I?
[154:49.70]I don't know where the fly is.
[154:50.34]The fly is more to the left.
[154:51.46]Where you at?
[155:10.23]Here?
[155:13.97]Yeah, he's right up here.
[155:25.25]Right there!
[155:31.70]Greetings, Spider.
[155:32.42]I appreciate your visit and your continued virtue.
[155:35.76]That's not what those are for?
[155:40.02]Jeremy, you're the Doctor Who of Twitch.
[155:44.49]I don't get that reference because I've only seen one episode of Doctor Who ever.
[155:49.15]It's the one where they time travel around like five times and he sees himself five times.
[155:56.17]I don't know what you mean by that.
[155:57.45]Anytime I think of Doctor Who, I could be completely off with this.
[156:06.17]But I always think of Doctor Who to me is like Harry Potter for adults.
[156:10.85]Is that correct?
[156:15.77]Does that make any sense?
[156:20.87]I feel like it's like the Harry Potter type kind of sci-fi fantasy world.
[156:26.58]But it's for like a grown-up audience?
[156:30.44]Not that he's a wizard.
[156:31.54]No, I'm just saying it's like that fantasy kind of whimsical world of Doctor Who.
[156:39.25]Right?
[156:43.71]It's very whimsical.
[156:52.38]Harry Potter isn't sci-fi.
[156:55.97]What, you don't remember the part where they were shooting the blasters?
[156:58.09]Okay, I got a quest for you.
[157:07.22]The queen is making a new princess to make a brand new hive.
[157:13.32]To make a princess, she needs royal jelly.
[157:15.10]And to make the jelly, she needs pollen.
[157:17.58]Only the best pollen.
[157:18.51]Pink.
[157:19.35]Orchid pollen.
[157:20.17]20 grains should do it.
[157:21.51]Bring that up to Canopy's Peak.
[157:23.45]I bet she'd love you.
[157:24.55]Come on.
[157:24.85]Okay.
[157:28.98]Very cool.
[157:32.54]So, okay, give me a, I don't know anything about Doctor Who.
[157:37.23]I want a, just a small, quick paragraph, TL;DR, of, okay, Doctor Who, each season of Doctor Who, it's like Final Fantasy, right?
[157:48.49]They're not connected, they're independent universes or something, it's like Final Fantasy.
[157:59.87]How many seasons of... Yeah, Doctor Who... Explain it to me.
[158:03.03]What is it?
[158:06.55]They're all connected.
[158:07.45]Oh.
[158:07.55]Okay, silly person travels with friends.
[158:16.28]Wacky British alien who time travels and does fucked up stuff.
[158:23.30]And
[158:25.29]Immortal alien.
[158:26.05]Hold on, this person has it.
[158:28.81]The doctor is an immortal alien who travels through time sorting out his personal problems with mortals.
[158:39.09]He's an alien that changes... So he's Rick from Rick and Morty.
[158:44.50]Alien that changes form every so often and goes on big space and time adventures and has fun shit and does fun stuff and has funny catchphrases.
[158:52.22]And he figures out his problems.
[158:55.17]I may have just caused the whole internet to fucking hate my life.
[159:01.39]So he's Rick from Rick and Morty.
[159:03.76]A bunch of you guys just turned purple, I think.
[159:07.48]I think a bunch of you guys turned purple.
[159:14.81]I'm just fucking kidding.
[159:16.53]I don't know anything about the show.
[159:17.79]I've never seen it.
[159:18.47]I've heard really good things about it.
[159:30.22]Somebody in all capital said, it's NOT Rick and Morty.
[159:32.98]I know, I'm just fucking around.
[159:34.42]I'm fucking with you, I promise.
[159:45.69]Okay, it's not, it's not Rick and Morty.
[159:48.33]It's not, but let me just be very clear.
[159:50.57]Let me be very fair.
[159:54.42]I see the same amount of merchandise of Doctor Who as Spencer Gifts that I see from Rick and Morty.
[160:01.73]I mean... Actually fair.
[160:13.86]Okay.
[160:23.02]So who's everybody's favorite doctor then?
[160:24.70]There's a new doctor every season, right?
[160:33.55]How many seasons are there?
[160:35.29]And is it worth getting into?
[160:37.57]And tell me the truth.
[160:40.41]I remember when we talked about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure one time.
[160:42.97]We were like, dude, you would love JoJo.
[160:45.32]Oh my god, it would be like your favorite series ever.
[160:47.82]Just skip the first season.
[160:49.10]Go to episode 5 of season 3.
[160:51.38]Watch that one twice.
[160:53.14]And then after you watch that episode two times, go back and watch the first episode.
[160:58.24]After you finish the first episode, then you're free to watch the rest of the series.
[161:03.42]But start at season 6.
[161:05.22]You can actually skip.
[161:05.94]You know what?
[161:06.40]Never mind.
[161:07.12]Never mind.
[161:07.78]Skip the first five seasons of JoJo.
[161:10.36]And I'm just like... Can I just watch the show?
[161:14.02]I'll just watch the show, I guess.
[161:19.99]Skippers?
[161:20.35]Yeah.
[161:20.49]What the hell?
[161:29.53]Watch it.
[161:30.01]Don't skip anything.
[161:31.91]Just watch the whole thing.
[161:34.15]Yeah, I know, but that's what I mean.
[161:35.63]Just start at... Seasons 1 through 5 are pretty good.
[161:39.87]See, here we go.
[161:40.55]Here we go.
[161:42.25]I'm telling you, here we go.
[161:45.06]Well, man, you know, he's correct, though.
[161:47.36]Seasons 1 through 5 are... I'm not so sure about that.
[161:57.15]It looks crazy, though.
[161:57.99]I actually... I was gonna watch it at one point, but I just kind of didn't.
[162:11.95]News is spreading.
[162:13.11]People are seething.
[162:14.99]What?
[162:15.23]What news?
[162:15.79]What do you mean?
[162:18.17]What news?
[162:18.99]News is spreading.
[162:19.60]People are mad.
[162:20.22]What do you mean news is spreading?
[162:22.70]What did I do?
[162:23.28]I'm going to apologize.
[162:25.34]What do I need to apologize for?
[162:26.28]What is it?
[162:28.90]What the fuck?
[162:29.30]I'm so mad.
[162:31.72]Because I called Dr. Who Rick from Rick and Morty.
[162:34.97]Let me apologize.
[162:35.91]Let me just really quickly fix this.
[162:39.05]Let me fix this.
[162:40.69]I...
[162:43.07]Hold on.
[162:44.57]I was wrong.
[162:45.03]Somebody said, they gave me a really, really basic understanding of what the show is.
[162:52.81]They said it's a guy that travels through space and figures out his problems with mortals and time travels and has interesting lasers and stuff.
[163:01.22]So I was like, okay, so he's Rick Sanchez.
[163:03.32]And then now everyone wants to kill me.
[163:12.91]But I was very uninformed.
[163:14.97]I was very uninformed.
[163:15.97]I'm very uninformed.
[163:18.21]Fucking get him.
[163:19.71]Bring up the Spencer's argument again.
[163:21.13]No, it wasn't an argument.
[163:22.46]He keeps jumping on spikes.
[163:24.88]Everybody relax.
[163:25.64]What I meant to say was... Listen to me.
[163:29.28]I don't know anything about the show.
[163:30.22]I don't know anything about the show.
[163:34.12]I just thought it was like whatever.
[163:35.16]I didn't know anything about it.
[163:36.26]And I made a little joke that...
[163:39.84]Just didn't go over well, and people thought it was not funny.
[163:43.93]And how dare I compare those two shows?
[163:46.45]I, look, hey, look.
[163:47.87]The Legacy of Doctor Who?
[163:49.75]Oh, I mean, it's one of the most respected television shows, like, ever on British television, right?
[163:53.90]I mean, we all know that.
[163:55.56]Of course I respect it.
[163:57.32]I'm just, it was an off, just a comment.
[164:04.95]Everyone's booing him.
[164:06.27]Stop booing me.
[164:11.04]How many- I need uh, how many more?
[164:14.36]There's no turning back now.
[164:33.56]Your career is over.
[164:40.34]It's just an observation.
[164:41.86]It wasn't real.
[164:43.80]It wasn't real.
[164:44.76]It was an observation.
[164:45.62]I was observing.
[164:47.81]I was just observing.
[164:50.89]I want to go high.
[164:51.47]There we go.
[164:51.71]There it is.
[164:56.95]Oh, right here.
[164:59.13]20, right?
[165:02.53]Dig your heels in, dude.
[165:03.57]Dude, you have to start digging your heels in now.
[165:14.41]He lost a thousand viewers because of that.
[165:18.65]I'm sorry.
[165:21.74]I don't watch TV, guys.
[165:22.82]I really don't.
[165:26.86]Get a lawyer?
[165:27.60]Can you imagine?
[165:31.36]Yes, we're dealing with the state of Nevada versus Jeremy Elbertson.
[165:37.55]And he talked about how Rick Sanchez and the doctor were essentially the same person being sued.
[165:50.61]It's so funny how just so inaccurate that statement probably was.
[165:54.07]I probably had some people spit there to drink out.
[165:58.18]What's my 2022 yearly anime?
[165:59.74]That's a good question.
[166:04.38]What is my 2022 yearly anime?
[166:10.79]What do you guys think?
[166:15.34]Oh, you know what?
[166:15.70]No, I called it the Harry Potter for adults, too, didn't I?
[166:20.36]I made a lot of just, like, like, like, just statements, huh?
[166:26.12]I was just full of shit this whole time.
[166:29.94]I'll tell you, what I did see of Doctor Who, I actually really, I thought was actually really good.
[166:33.26]I thought the episode was really good.
[166:36.34]It was the one with, uh, David, yeah, David, um, what's his name?
[166:42.10]David Tennant.
[166:43.32]He was great.
[166:44.40]I've seen at least a few clips.
[166:46.14]I've seen at least two or three episodes.
[166:53.74]Oh, boys.
[166:54.24]People are going to be mad about this.
[166:58.22]But I'm going to show it.
[166:58.80]Because I have to.
[167:03.89]Because I just have to.
[167:27.49]I don't know.
[167:28.69]I honestly don't even know the context of that image.
[167:31.37]Some of you maybe get it, I don't get it.
[167:33.19]That's a line from the show?
[167:51.06]I thought- Oh, I thought you were combining two things!
[167:54.97]I thought the, I'm Doctor Who and the, IN THIS MOTHERFUCKER!
[167:58.35]I thought that was you, there was a Rick Sanchez, you were combining two of them.
[168:02.97]Like, I'm Doctor Who and this motherfucker!
[168:05.49]Yeah, that's right, me, Rick!
[168:07.38]Doctor Who!
[168:09.00]Yeah!
[168:10.14]I thought that's what you were doing, that's not what you were doing, okay?
[168:13.04]That's a line that Doctor Who says.
[168:18.54]I'm very confused, I'm incredibly confused right now.
[168:23.26]Who, who says that?
[168:26.63]That's a line from the show.
[168:27.59]Rick says that in one of the later seasons.
[168:31.25]Wait, he does?
[168:35.71]Wait, Rick says that in the show as a joke, like the joke of... Oh.
[168:42.40]Okay.
[168:47.56]I don't watch either one of these shows, guys.
[168:49.42]I don't.
[168:54.74]What?
[169:00.85]I don't know, should I show these?
[169:02.14]I feel like I'm gonna make everybody hate me.
[169:04.32]You fucked up so bad.
[169:08.50]I don't watch either of these shows.
[169:11.96]You could show me, you could gaslight me so bad on both these shows.
[169:15.24]In fact, I think that's what happened.
[169:16.50]I'm sorry.
[169:17.62]People have been just like gaslighting me this whole time, and they were telling me that Doctor Who was Rick and Morty.
[169:23.94]So I believed them, so that's why I made that comment about Spencer Gifts, and everybody got mad.
[169:34.29]Alright, alright, alright, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[169:39.47]I get it.
[169:42.21]I thought, I thought you made that up.
[169:43.87]Rick and Morty came out first.
[169:55.88]Oh my goodness, that person's... Dude, turn off your DMs.
[170:09.92]Okay.
[170:13.38]This was supposed to be a stream where I played a game as a bug and we relaxed.
[170:17.03]So that's what we're going to do.
[170:19.11]That's what we're going to do.
[170:21.39]I apologize to all the Doctor Who fans and all the Rick and Morty fans and all the Harry Potter fans.
[170:28.01]Sorry.
[170:29.41]I've been on a roll the last few weeks talking about everybody's favorite television shows and movies that I thought would... But I've never seen them.
[170:36.15]Never mind.
[170:39.86]You've ruined my life.
[170:43.22]Okay.
[170:44.18]I need to find little things.
[170:52.32]I apologize.
[170:55.88]Let me ask you a question, though.
[170:58.02]What... I know that... Okay.
[171:01.41]Is there a show that if I... I feel like Rick and Morty has a ton of people that like it, big fans, but a ton of people that hate it.
[171:11.85]What's a show that has a bunch of people that just hate it?
[171:14.39]It's just everybody doesn't like it.
[171:17.07]Is there one?
[171:24.82]Game of Thrones.
[171:25.40]Alright, Game of Thrones is pretty close.
[171:35.56]That's a tough question.
[171:36.26]Oh my god, I'm doing so terribly.
[171:40.01]Okay, I need... Dude.
[171:47.29]Big Mouth?
[171:49.23]Big Mouth.
[171:50.71]Big Bang Theory?
[171:51.57]No, I don't... Dude, Big Bang Theory has a ton of fans.
[171:55.63]That show lasted almost 10 years.
[171:58.53]It had 600 trillion dollars in revenue somehow.
[172:02.68]That show had a lot of fans.
[172:14.39]Okay.
[172:15.89]There's one here.
[172:23.29]Alright, seven more.
[172:25.55]Riverdale, Riverdale.
[172:27.23]People saying Riverdale.
[172:28.43]Young Sheldon.
[172:33.05]Oh, my sister was a real cool character.
[172:36.67]Me and my trains and my brother and my father.
[172:49.43]That's how I know.
[172:50.03]Yep.
[172:50.95]Bingo.
[172:52.35]Bingo.
[172:52.93]There it is.
[172:54.02]Bingo.
[172:56.10]I knew it.
[172:56.82]I knew I could unite you all.
[173:01.50]In your collective hatred of me.
[173:07.74]I knew I could unite everybody.
[173:21.65]Alright, six more.
[173:22.33]Me and Ollie were talking about shows that we wanted to catch up with or watch.
[173:32.18]I haven't seen any of Better Call Saul after season two.
[173:34.84]I want to watch a lot of that.
[173:37.64]The Boys season three is coming out, right?
[173:41.02]Which, I don't know if I'm excited for it, but it's okay.
[173:45.45]I thought it was alright.
[173:46.35]I kind of want to see what happens.
[173:54.28]Boy Season 2 was boring.
[173:55.80]Yeah, that's... I mean, it was alright.
[173:57.68]It was just... Season 1 was crazy.
[174:01.18]You want me to help you?
[174:03.82]I gotta help this guy.
[174:05.56]Can I not help you?
[174:12.45]Can't break it.
[174:18.01]Barry's pretty good.
[174:19.51]Barry was pretty good.
[174:27.86]Press E?
[174:29.64]Better Call Saul is the best.
[174:34.75]Did I just eat him?
[174:37.19]Oh, I just ate him.
[174:37.69]Have you watched any good documentaries lately?
[174:45.78]I fell asleep through Super Size Me 2.
[174:48.84]But that's not because the documentary wasn't bad or something.
[174:50.88]I just was really, really tired.
[175:05.37]I love, you know what it is?
[175:07.75]YouTube has free movies.
[175:09.05]They're just ads.
[175:11.73]Just ad supported movies.
[175:13.39]And it's just a bunch of weird old shit.
[175:18.49]I'll just pick one of those.
[175:20.29]And just watch it.
[175:26.51]You should watch The Expanse.
[175:33.33]Yeah, everyone's saying to watch The Expanse.
[175:37.54]Why isn't the expanse just Rick and Morty for adults?
[175:54.17]I think I got them all over here.
[176:03.02]Did I go this way?
[176:03.54]I did not.
[176:11.45]That's a great show.
[176:12.57]That's a great bait.
[176:18.81]What a troll.
[176:20.94]Yeah.
[176:22.22]Yeah, I know.
[176:28.84]The expanse is actually Harry Potter for kids.
[176:39.27]Go fly!
[176:39.89]How come I'm not flying?
[176:46.96]Just being completely uninformed.
[176:49.60]And just talking out my ass.
[176:53.92]There are people that... I know, like, we talk about this and we fuck around.
[176:58.12]But there are probably people that have come to this stream and have heard me say, like, dude, this guy just said Doctor Who was fucking Rick and Morty.
[177:03.04]Like, I fucking hate this guy.
[177:05.17]I mean, it kind of makes me sad in a way.
[177:08.21]Um, this is gonna be hard.
[177:18.94]I gotta hang.
[177:19.48]There we go, okay.
[177:33.30]If you care enough about Doctor Who to get mad at that.
[177:35.70]I'm so- I need to fucking focus.
[177:43.48]Let me focus.
[177:55.95]So where, where can, what's safe?
[177:57.11]Maybe I should just grab one of these.
[178:01.72]Oh, yup.
[178:16.52]Got it.
[178:20.59]Oh yeah.
[178:20.91]Alright.
[178:21.13]Only two more.
[178:27.44]spot over here.
[178:35.46]The peak is over here.
[178:36.86]Only one more after this.
[178:37.78]Hopefully I didn't miss any.
[178:39.83]I'd be very unhappy if I did.
[178:41.05]19.
[178:41.07]One more.
[178:52.58]Tooth stream?
[178:54.74]What is a tooth stream?
[179:09.96]Oh, you know what Holly brought up yesterday that I didn't even realize?
[179:13.25]The old Scooby-Doo had a laugh track.
[179:16.77]That's so weird.
[179:17.59]Cartoons had laugh tracks.
[179:26.76]Where's this last one?
[179:27.60]Right here.
[179:29.64]Yes!
[179:30.26]I didn't miss any.
[179:35.63]Yeah, I did.
[179:41.30]Stop!
[179:42.56]I didn't notice, no.
[179:43.95]Yeah, it had celebrity guests, too.
[179:53.07]Here comes my impatience.
[180:00.80]Alright, slow down.
[180:05.71]I'm a spider, for God's sake.
[180:06.87]Like, just do this.
[180:11.63]So much safer.
[180:12.21]Get at it, what are you doing?
[180:25.40]There we go.
[180:26.04]20!
[180:29.61]Go to the peak.
[180:41.08]I'm not, no!
[180:42.45]Why do you want me to say that?
[180:43.59]You want to clip it so you can make me look like an idiot.
[180:45.41]Do I need more than 20?
[180:59.81]I know it's not an old idea, but having a random laugh track just show up during the stream, I think it's kind of funny.
[181:17.95]You already did that?
[181:19.39]Yeah, I know.
[181:21.73]Come on.
[181:22.09]What do you mean I got- Why does that mean?
[181:47.32]Hey, dude, I got other people to say it.
[181:50.02]So?
[181:54.85]Aye, aye, aye.
[181:58.37]I'm just too fast.
[182:02.39]I do... What am I doing?
[182:04.90]Alright, I gotta go to the peak.
[182:11.68]I've got 20.
[182:20.95]Okay, I just wanted that last one.
[182:32.36]Alright.
[182:37.89]Spider's mates eat their heads.
[182:40.97]That's fucking weird.
[182:43.05]Alright, almost there.
[182:46.70]Come on, I was right there, dude.
[182:54.13]Come on, dude.
[182:55.67]Come on, bro.
[182:56.95]Praying Mantis?
[182:57.63]I think a lot of bugs eat each other.
[182:58.85]Tons of bugs eat each other.
[183:00.80]What's over here?
[183:13.32]Oh, hey again.
[183:13.96]Glad to see you took me up on the pollen quest.
[183:17.42]Envy's peak is just a bit further this way.
[183:19.12]Hope you don't... Hope you get the 20 we need.
[183:21.48]The queen is waiting.
[183:23.75]I got it, I'm on it.
[183:31.15]Ants eat other ants.
[183:31.89]Yeah, it's weird.
[183:34.67]God, ants are so weird.
[183:35.73]Bugs are so weird in general.
[183:41.41]Like I told you before, ants are just a math problem.
[183:44.93]Ants are math.
[183:48.58]The weird coordination, they're just a calculation.
[183:51.62]Ants are math.
[183:55.40]They're almost a simple AI.
[184:00.18]It's really interesting.
[184:08.12]Reused bit.
[184:10.00]Well, it's not reused.
[184:12.08]Because last time I did this bit, I think there were 4,000 or 5,000 people here.
[184:15.28]Now there's 50,000 in current viewers.
[184:18.93]My goodness.
[184:20.85]Thanks, guys.
[184:21.39]Welcome to the stream.
[184:24.19]Alright, we're almost there.
[184:35.85]Yeah, just wait, just wait for the course of this guide video.
[184:39.59]Where they're gonna talk about how bugs answer math.
[184:48.99]Just a basic math problem.
[184:57.60]Whoa, this is cool.
[185:05.17]Look, it's the little spider.
[185:06.03]Heard you've been helping out with the pollen quest.
[185:09.11]You got your 20 grains?
[185:10.15]Go on in.
[185:11.09]Queen awaits.
[185:15.16]What does this get me?
[185:22.84]A new hat?
[185:23.66]Okay, 13.5, Andy.
[185:24.50]Alright, heard so much about you.
[185:29.08]Have you brought the pollen for the princess royal jelly?
[185:32.85]Yes, this shall make a powerful jelly.
[185:35.61]The new princess will be magnificent.
[185:37.65]Wait here a moment while we prepare her.
[185:39.63]I'm sure she would love to meet you.
[185:43.46]What do I actually get for doing this?
[185:50.08]Behold.
[185:52.38]Your princess has arrived.
[185:54.78]She's so beautiful.
[185:56.36]Such powerful wings.
[185:58.41]Thank you all for your hard labor preparing my royal jelly.
[186:03.41]Dear spider, my mother told me of your predicament as I lay in my cell.
[186:08.06]You're planning a rescue mission to a magic island in the sky.
[186:10.72]I can think of no greater adventure with which to stretch my new wings.
[186:15.86]Come with me.
[186:16.20]I will take you home and help prepare our voyage.
[186:18.56]This is eating my head.
[186:42.01]Nice hat, thanks.
[186:42.59]We're going a long way.
[186:49.23]Okay, so what... What else do I need?
[187:01.13]Where the hell am I?
[187:06.82]Um... Oh, here we are.
[187:10.74]Alright, did I get anything new?
[187:13.60]Here's the rest of our pre-flight checklist.
[187:15.48]Talk to the princess about sealing up the balloon.
[187:17.46]Okay.
[187:18.20]I need fuel.
[187:19.68]Okay, so I need fuel.
[187:26.50]Is the princess fixing this?
[187:30.08]Oh, there you are.
[187:31.96]This is the balloon that's supposed to take us to the magic island in the sky?
[187:38.24]It'll never make it in this condition.
[187:39.96]Let me fix that up for you.
[187:45.97]This is your real hair.
[187:49.45]See?
[187:51.29]This is real hair.
[187:51.95]Ta-da.
[187:59.23]We shouldn't have any problems now.
[188:00.21]These wax patches are completely airtight.
[188:01.93]Alright, cool.
[188:06.46]So now I need fuel.
[188:07.20]For the west.
[188:09.40]So I need to go this way.
[188:11.78]Dung beetles, right?
[188:14.30]Cool.
[188:17.09]I saw the... I saw... What do you mean?
[188:26.27]I don't know what I was trying to do with that.
[188:27.77]Like, I was trying to make it look like I had a bald cap on or something.
[188:30.37]I don't know what... That was weird.
[188:31.47]Okay, I want to go up this way.
[188:43.62]Yeah, I was just moving my head back and forth.
[188:45.32]What the fuck was that?
[188:48.16]Alright, this way.
[188:50.92]This game's cute.
[188:51.67]This is a cute game.
[189:04.47]So, go get fuel from the dung beetles.
[189:27.26]Did I miss my... Why am I back at this tutorial?
[189:30.42]Can I wrap around?
[189:40.89]Does I need to go... Is there like a log to go through or something?
[189:43.83]How do I get over there?
[190:00.69]Is there a log here?
[190:01.53]How do I get over there?
[190:36.27]I can't go over there.
[190:41.89]Maybe down and to the left?
[190:50.64]There's a hole under the log.
[191:01.94]No help.
[191:07.18]Do you put chicken fat in your hair?
[191:08.54]No.
[191:16.02]Down here?
[191:16.40]This is definitely it.
[191:24.48]Oh yeah.
[191:28.72]Alright, looking for fuel for the hot air balloon.
[191:44.24]Oh, shit.
[191:44.64]The speedrun for this game is probably insane.
[191:50.54]It probably is.
[191:51.06]Well, hold on.
[192:02.27]I... I can't breathe under there.
[192:11.98]Okay, so what am I looking for?
[192:12.98]I can't grab onto any of this, so I gotta move the rocks.
[192:19.52]Follow me.
[192:21.18]There we go.
[192:21.66]Go!
[192:48.82]I kinda- I wonder how long- what's the speedrun?
[192:50.54]Anybody know?
[192:54.34]What's the actual speedrun?
[192:55.18]Fuck, I can't get up there.
[192:59.33]I can grab this.
[193:30.56]16 minutes?
[193:30.82]Jesus.
[193:36.20]16 minutes.
[193:37.66]That's so fast.
[193:42.87]I spent 16 minutes stalling the start of my stream.
[193:48.55]I can't imagine completing this whole game in 16 minutes.
[194:06.44]This level's cool because it's kind of just a lot of swinging.
[194:09.66]Swinging is fun.
[194:10.20]I feel like there's such crazy tech with that too.
[194:18.56]With just the boom boom boom boom mega thing to climb on.
[194:20.76]Like that, and he's still moving.
[194:27.26]That's so cool.
[194:40.64]Takes my brain five seconds to go.
[194:42.69]I can go there and there.
[194:43.67]There we go.
[194:49.50]There we go.
[194:56.78]Fluid.
[194:58.41]Fluid!
[195:13.51]I'm going in deep here.
[195:14.53]How far up do I have to go?
[195:16.13]Oops.
[195:23.12]Oh, I have to launch this.
[195:26.74]Yep.
[195:28.02]I think.
[195:28.28]Maybe eventually.
[195:30.62]Okay, let's try it.
[195:34.08]My eyes are so watery.
[195:37.39]Have I blinked in an hour?
[195:44.86]I think I'm in trouble here.
[195:46.98]Wait, what's down here?
[195:52.48]Can I pull this?
[196:18.70]I wonder what I'm supposed to do here.
[196:27.54]What do I do?
[196:43.06]Oh there we go.
[196:45.49]Kind of?
[196:47.09]Kind of.
[196:58.08]Yeah!
[197:08.48]Oh!
[197:17.52]Get a launch.
[197:19.40]Launch.
[197:20.12]Launch.
[197:21.72]Swing.
[197:22.11]Up.
[197:23.83]Swing.
[197:25.83]Launch.
[197:27.83]Launch.
[197:30.11]Swing.
[197:30.97]Launch.
[197:40.89]Swing and launch.
[197:41.51]There it is.
[197:46.67]Swing up, launch.
[197:56.04]OK.
[197:57.78]I'm getting there.
[197:58.26]Alright, don't mess this up.
[198:11.54]Warning landslides.
[198:15.74]Bunker.
[198:17.08]Bunker.
[198:23.62]Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me.
[198:25.58]Okay.
[198:29.14]What is that?
[198:29.60]Those are eggs?
[198:47.28]I don't know where I'm going.
[198:48.18]I'm just sliding around.
[198:50.62]Mr. Sark is here?
[198:51.32]Oh, Mr. Sark is here!
[198:52.42]What's up, Sark?
[198:58.09]Hope you're doing well.
[199:01.93]Mr. Sark is, uh, I would say one of the original funniest internet people.
[199:07.73]Been around a long time.
[199:08.58]Maybe a lot of you don't know who Mr. Sark is.
[199:12.20]Oh, I would fix that immediately.
[199:15.17]Whoa.
[199:16.81]Hey there, friend.
[199:20.09]Welcome to dung town.
[199:23.97]How do I get dung?
[199:28.59]Pushing a great big ball of dung is one of the best workouts.
[199:33.03]Where do I get it?
[199:35.23]Fresh dung is the best dung.
[199:41.28]Where do I get it?
[199:42.72]What kind of dung?
[199:43.50]Is it like cow shit?
[199:44.42]What do they use?
[199:52.97]You want some?
[199:53.81]You're in luck.
[199:54.25]We've got some friends with loads of dung to share.
[199:56.47]Just not here.
[199:58.19]It's up the hill a fair way, and there's one small problem with getting up there.
[200:03.41]To the point.
[200:05.01]Look, we need to get across these puddles, and I broke my wing a while back.
[200:08.36]No flying means we're in need of a walking-based solution.
[200:13.60]Think you could use your fancy web skills to string us a bridge out of them sticks?
[200:17.42]Help the beetles cross the puddles, okay.
[200:20.18]Done, easy.
[200:26.63]Go.
[200:26.79]I got it.
[200:35.49]What do you guys want?
[200:36.95]I don't understand what they want.
[200:44.89]They want a bridge?
[200:47.03]But how... I don't get it.
[201:02.98]I actually don't get it.
[201:04.46]They want me to make a bridge, but they can't walk a... ...thing like this?
[201:08.68]Like, just... ...basic little bridge?
[201:11.57]I don't understand.
[201:16.26]Or do you mean, pull these out of the water, make a bridge, and then... Hold on.
[201:24.18]Set these on top of the web?
[201:53.08]No, you move out of the fucking way.
[201:56.02]You're just crowding me.
[201:57.40]Get out of the way.
[201:58.08]Stop the other... What are you talking... Wait, wait.
[202:02.98]I'm putting... That, right?
[202:06.64]But then the log has to go on top of those.
[202:08.80]On top of that.
[202:09.52]That's how this works.
[202:12.04]That's the only way it can work, right?
[202:22.07]He's pretending.
[202:25.80]I can't make a bridge with two sticks!
[202:28.02]There's not enough- I need more sticks!
[202:31.55]I need, like, ten of these!
[202:32.89]How am I- what?
[202:37.57]Look, I- how am I gonna walk across this?
[202:41.75]Look!
[202:42.71]These guys are so huge!
[202:44.00]The third log, but how are they gonna get across this one?
[202:48.00]They're gonna be stranded!
[203:04.72]Now what?
[203:06.51]He's almost- Are you- They said, make us a nice bridge with your web.
[203:12.67]Alright, bros!
[203:13.37]Step on it!
[203:15.00]Go- Step on it, then!
[203:18.50]What do you want me to do?
[203:19.40]Hey, you fixed the bridge.
[203:22.63]Go!
[203:22.99]Yeah!
[203:23.45]Go ahead!
[203:24.11]You fucking idiots!
[203:39.25]That was fucked up.
[203:45.29]That was fucked up.
[203:50.14]That was fucked up.
[203:52.34]He just mushed over all that.
[204:01.29]I'm not softlocked.
[204:02.37]Why are you being so toxic?
[204:06.86]I'm not being toxic.
[204:07.78]I'm being realistic.
[204:09.44]This is not toxic to say, dude, what are you... Go up!
[204:24.47]I need to move this big one over there now, right?
[204:26.61]Because they're not going to go over there unless it's there.
[204:28.65]Is there one over on the other side?
[204:37.07]Stop yelling at them.
[204:37.83]Hold on, I can... Can I go under?
[204:39.09]Oh my fucking god.
[204:39.57]Really?
[204:39.71]Really?
[204:39.87]Really?
[205:38.48]I thought I was gonna have to do that iPad game where you make the whole bridge with the web.
[205:42.85]I thought I was gonna have to do shit like this.
[205:44.21]You know what I mean?
[205:46.11]Like connect the- make a bridge with the web.
[205:49.79]Okay.
[205:49.99]We're good.
[205:54.15]We can relax.
[205:55.54]We can just relax.
[206:00.42]Yes, bridge constructor.
[206:01.30]That's what I thought I was gonna have to do.
[206:02.92]Okay, go ahead and cross it.
[206:13.08]What kind of bullshit is this?
[206:16.26]Just float!
[206:18.16]Just float!
[206:19.76]You know what, dude?
[206:20.30]Just go.
[206:21.66]I promise you.
[206:24.36]Go!
[206:24.46]Why won't you go?
[206:25.18]Why won't he go?
[206:33.63]Give it a go.
[206:36.09]Yep, go!
[206:36.53]He's there!
[206:43.02]Right?
[206:43.24]Why wouldn't he go?
[206:43.88]Alright, go ahead.
[207:15.51]Wasn't even hard.
[207:17.01]Tell them Wendy and Michael sent you.
[207:26.62]Help the beetles?
[207:29.54]And I got some dung.
[207:32.80]Very nice.
[207:33.32]Alright, so now I've got dung.
[207:34.48]I have fuel.
[207:37.94]Am I ready to go?
[207:38.56]What else is left?
[207:44.50]You did that in the worst possible way.
[207:45.82]It's alright.
[207:48.92]This has to get done.
[207:52.19]Ask yourself a question.
[207:53.75]Did the dung beetle get across the lake unharmed?
[207:58.83]That was the goal?
[208:03.77]Yes.
[208:05.43]Does it matter how?
[208:06.11]Or does it matter that the goal happened?
[208:09.97]Dung beetle gets across the body of water completely unharmed.
[208:15.15]That's it.
[208:28.19]Was there like a dung beetle king or queen or something?
[208:32.77]Because I'm going all the way up.
[208:36.33]Look at this.
[208:55.25]It's kinda cool.
[208:55.65]I don't care.
[209:12.74]What if I scale the whole dung mountain?
[209:21.56]Is there a reliable fast way to get back, by the way?
[209:32.88]No secret?
[209:33.39]Come on.
[209:42.55]What is all the way over here?
[209:49.20]Oh, Jesus.
[209:50.00]Hold on.
[210:10.98]I don't actually... I'm not going to go to the whole thing, right?
[210:15.40]There's more to do?
[210:17.12]All the way up?
[210:20.20]Can you do a twerk stream?
[210:21.28]I don't think I would have to do a whole stream for that, man.
[210:23.94]I think I'd just do that in five seconds.
[210:25.18]I think I have to weigh this down.
[210:44.09]No, don't.
[210:45.25]Come here.
[210:45.49]I definitely have to put weight on this, right?
[211:09.27]What does this do?
[211:12.02]Okay.
[211:13.75]Oh, alright.
[211:16.75]All the way?
[211:22.55]All the way?
[211:23.05]I wonder... Whoa!
[211:26.76]Hold on now.
[211:31.30]Don't go anywhere.
[211:35.54]What's the point of that?
[211:45.12]I don't see anything here.
[211:54.99]What's the point of that?
[211:57.71]He probably could twerk if he tried.
[212:00.21]It's going to take 100 million dollars for me to twerk on stream.
[212:02.23]Alright, there you go.
[212:21.49]I'm almost at the peak!
[212:24.96]You already did.
[212:28.98]What the fuck is this?
[213:06.37]How come I can't kill this?
[213:14.79]I can't save that.
[213:15.79]Oh, here we go.
[213:20.82]Try this one.
[213:27.78]twerking though it is twerking what the fuck am I talking about but that was like why does it sound like this is what speed is this
[213:59.66]It is slowed down.
[214:13.31]That's fine.
[214:13.83]Whatever.
[214:15.11]I don't care.
[214:18.51]Eating a handful of beans.
[214:21.15]He admits it.
[214:22.09]He needs a glove.
[214:22.87]What the hell is he doing?
[214:36.17]Alright, I'm getting to the top of Dung Mountain.
[214:37.53]I know it's getting late.
[214:44.57]I feel like I'm pretty close to the end of the game, though.
[214:46.87]yeah impromptu uh like 7 p.m pacific stream and I do apologize for that if you don't know why I'm not streaming tomorrow and I decided to stream right now at 7 p.m four hours ago or so because I have to take auto to the vet tomorrow I need to get him checked out just a couple of things I want to make sure that he's good to go and I want to get him in so I'm gonna be doing that tomorrow
[215:12.50]We're doing House Flipper Pet DLC on Saturday, and then Sunday we're doing Blood Wash and the other horror game, Murder House.
[215:22.41]Or we might do that on Saturday and then do Pets on Sunday.
[215:25.27]Depends on how I feel.
[215:28.48]Keep us updated.
[215:29.08]Oh, I will.
[215:30.04]He's fine, don't worry.
[215:30.90]He's fine.
[215:32.60]I would tell you if I was actually concerned, but I am not, so he's completely fine.
[215:39.83]Yeah, sorry, we started late and are going late.
[215:47.12]Still going here.
[215:48.18]I hope there's a fast way to get back.
[215:50.40]Because I'm going across the whole damn game right now.
[215:59.11]God!
[216:12.21]Slow down, fuck.
[216:35.01]I just thought of this picture again and it's like making me laugh.
[216:37.73]I just thought of this picture.
[216:38.65]It just popped up.
[216:45.61]It just flashed in my brain and I had to look at it again.
[216:54.99]I need to get to the top of Dong Mountain, even if it's a stupid achievement or something.
[217:17.88]Alright, here we go!
[217:20.04]I made it!
[217:25.22]Howdy, spider!
[217:26.36]Wendy and Mike sent you, did they?
[217:28.25]You must be here for the bounty of dung.
[217:30.05]We got some for you right on over here.
[217:32.11]Only problem is this dung is a little too comforting.
[217:36.05]Our lazy son is simply refusing to leave the ball.
[217:40.06]It's so hot out there.
[217:40.74]Why would I want to leave?
[217:41.56]Little spider, it's all yours if you can convince him to get out and see a bit of the world.
[217:46.31]Give it a little push.
[218:06.33]Oh!
[218:16.99]So this is the fast way to get back.
[218:19.83]That makes sense.
[218:23.41]Hang on.
[218:23.79]Did I make it?
[218:28.62]Nice.
[218:33.16]I got the fuel.
[218:35.38]You're gonna kill him?
[218:35.94]He's fine, it's padding.
[218:45.63]Did I seriously just get kicked out of my home?
[218:47.99]I'll just have to live here now, I guess.
[218:50.17]Help yourself to some dung.
[218:51.37]It's my favorite.
[218:52.87]Very energy dense.
[218:55.43]Cool.
[218:56.83]Okay.
[218:57.56]How much do I need?
[218:58.14]How many balls of dung do I need?
[219:09.28]Can you come grab this?
[219:13.67]Oh, it's coming all the way down.
[219:14.67]Alright.
[219:15.49]How many balls should I do?
[219:16.69]One or two?
[219:19.77]I'll try to grab one.
[219:20.53]No.
[219:20.85]Alright, send it up.
[219:32.72]No.
[219:47.78]Okay, now you're just fucking with me.
[219:48.72]Get up there.
[220:01.11]Dung!
[220:03.25]Here we go.
[220:07.83]Where do I need to put it?
[220:09.83]Okay.
[220:18.12]Am I ready to go?
[220:18.78]Okay, now the dunks are going underneath there, right?
[220:49.36]Grab the dung.
[220:56.97]Dung in the cup.
[220:57.49]That's what I'm trying to do.
[221:08.77]Got it.
[221:11.00]Okay, here's the rest of the checklist.
[221:13.22]Patch engine immediately below the mouth of the balloon.
[221:15.66]Burn the secret pilot platform to balloon.
[221:18.50]Just follow the blueprints.
[221:22.13]Alright, let me see the blueprints.
[221:26.57]Fuel in the engine.
[221:28.33]Engine up into here.
[221:29.51]It's patched up.
[221:30.63]Spiderweb this all.
[221:31.86]I'm ready to go!
[221:32.38]Okay, now we stick this in here.
[221:46.88]Now I have to attach this.
[222:22.81]Click in there already.
[222:32.43]Click in there!
[222:33.11]Why is it not clicking in there?
[222:43.30]Come on, do like a...
[222:52.30]It doesn't click in?
[222:53.07]Oh, well it's in.
[222:56.99]Alright, it's in.
[223:00.15]Now I need webs?
[223:21.91]I'm ready to fly!
[223:25.79]Are you ready to head out?
[223:26.63]No.
[223:31.15]Okay.
[223:31.95]So, um, I got that done.
[223:33.07]I need to go turn in the bugs.
[223:38.84]Let's go.
[223:46.68]Why did it fall?
[223:49.81]This doesn't look safe.
[223:50.95]Reattach it.
[223:56.60]Turn up the music for the finale.
[223:57.74]Okay.
[224:05.13]We did it!
[224:06.19]Engine normal.
[224:07.39]Airspeed increasing.
[224:08.32]This is it.
[224:08.70]We're flying.
[224:22.22]Engine nominal.
[224:22.90]Airspeed increasing.
[224:24.06]This is it.
[224:24.42]We're flying.
[224:26.35]What if I cut the strings?
[224:27.17]You can't.
[224:51.13]Oh, dude, fuck it.
[224:51.85]Let's get the skateboard out.
[225:01.75]No, not the board, bro!
[225:05.13]The ship is holding on, barely.
[225:53.48]Mayday?
[226:07.01]What the fuck's that?
[226:07.57]I don't know, these look like asteroids.
[226:12.63]It's gems!
[226:13.37]How do I collect the gems?
[226:18.29]Well, this storm was not on the forecast.
[226:19.79]The ship is still holding out.
[226:21.85]The wind is really picking up now.
[226:22.93]I feel so alive.
[226:24.11]Uh-oh.
[226:32.50]Stay safe.
[226:32.90]We'll keep the engine running for you.
[226:44.89]It was all fucked up.
[226:45.57]I had to fix it.
[226:53.72]This is it.
[226:54.24]The sky... lower.
[226:56.38]The airship won't be able to make it any further in the storm.
[226:58.30]You'll have to continue without us.
[227:00.32]Go find your love.
[227:01.34]We'll meet you on the other side.
[227:02.36]This is the crow place.
[227:11.30]He says, uh-oh, like a toddler who shit his pants.
[227:18.54]Uh-oh.
[227:21.56]Oh, no.
[227:30.04]Up in the sky area.
[227:36.24]This is kind of loud.
[227:42.64]Do I have to take this with me or something?
[227:46.34]Where do I go?
[228:02.26]Does it break?
[228:11.11]Um, what?
[228:11.65]Ah, okay.
[228:34.07]Alright, I get it.
[228:34.75]Yeah, this is gonna be a pain in the ass, isn't it?
[228:36.35]It's a little, a little loud for me.
[228:49.38]Nothing down there.
[228:50.06]Alright, let's just...
[229:03.83]I'm here.
[229:09.22]I'm here.
[229:20.00]Where is it?
[229:20.70]Up there.
[229:21.22]Shit.
[229:21.66]Get over here.
[229:24.32]Whoa!
[229:40.77]Oh, shit.
[229:58.82]No!
[230:06.10]Will you please?
[230:07.42]Come on!
[230:10.80]Oh, my God.
[230:11.80]Oi!
[230:45.46]Okay.
[230:45.70]Alright.
[230:45.90]I made it.
[230:46.30]I got it.
[230:46.52]I got it.
[230:48.50]I need the ball.
[230:51.53]Where's the ball?
[230:56.51]Where's the ball?
[231:07.06]Where's the ball?
[231:09.36]I left the ball.
[231:11.60]Are you kidding me?
[231:23.29]Where?
[231:23.57]I didn't leave the ball?
[231:29.68]Where's the ball?
[231:30.22]Am I soft locked?
[231:55.17]Huh?
[232:05.20]Holy shit, that was 100 IQ.
[232:39.81]Yes!
[232:40.17]Okay, let me take a look.
[232:46.16]What's over here?
[232:47.66]A lot of bullshit.
[232:59.91]Where you going?
[233:11.60]Go in.
[233:13.98]Go in.
[233:15.98]Go in.
[233:16.30]I'm almost there.
[233:24.66]There's going to be two, isn't there?
[233:38.85]Oh, God.
[233:40.75]Whoa!
[233:47.57]Where is it?
[233:48.01]Okay, there's one here.
[233:49.12]Alright, just go underneath.
[233:54.46]Underneath should be fine.
[234:09.84]Come with me.
[234:14.12]There it is.
[234:14.58]Thank you.
[234:29.10]And open the door.
[234:32.66]Bad.
[234:34.04]Not bad.
[234:40.02]I made it.
[234:40.30]Do I have to fight the crow?
[234:43.38]I don't want to really fight it.
[234:44.12]I like crows.
[235:10.06]And?
[235:10.24]Oh shit.
[235:17.95]Escape the sky boar with your boyfriend.
[235:21.79]I found ya!
[235:35.54]Shouldn't we get out of here?
[235:39.33]Alright, come with me.
[235:40.71]We gotta go.
[235:44.23]We gotta go now.
[235:48.21]Come on, we gotta go now.
[235:50.92]We gotta go now!
[235:55.78]Dude, we gotta go now.
[236:01.02]Oh, okay.
[236:02.34]Uh, you got any of those, you got any of those gems anywhere?
[236:22.26]I need a gem.
[236:27.53]Is your head made out of gems?
[236:30.47]What?
[236:31.51]Oh.
[236:31.61]I think I just saw the crow.
[236:54.86]Can you get up here?
[236:57.88]No, I got you.
[236:58.46]I got you.
[236:58.76]Watch out.
[236:59.04]Okay, you're good.
[237:09.13]Can you make it?
[237:13.40]Come on.
[237:26.26]Holding Q is kind of hard in doing WASD.
[237:32.65]What's wrong?
[237:35.13]What's wrong?
[237:37.35]What's wrong?
[237:42.58]Get over here, you dummy!
[237:57.30]What the... You settle the fuck down.
[237:59.72]Like, honest to God, settle the fuck down.
[238:03.74]Really?
[238:04.04]That was so outrageous.
[238:08.96]That was so over the top.
[238:12.15]That was fucking horrible for me.
[238:13.75]I don't know why.
[238:14.51]Why is that so bad?
[238:15.45]That wasn't even a tuber reaction.
[238:18.31]That was like, I just... I really did not think that was going to happen for any reason.
[238:27.33]That was so bad!
[238:28.57]Why did I get scared so bad?
[238:30.67]It was the music, too.
[238:35.84]Yo, you scared my bird?
[238:42.68]Oh!
[238:43.18]Let's hear what they have to say!
[238:44.14]Oh, wow, a lot to say, that bird.
[238:49.98]Wow.
[239:06.98]One of my mods is saying, when you screamed, that made my Discord lag for some reason.
[239:15.28]I don't know, man.
[239:18.42]Will you get up here?
[239:20.16]We could have already been through the stupid jumpscare part.
[239:22.33]Follow me.
[239:31.15]Just get Burgah Boy technique.
[239:32.83]You know what?
[239:33.17]I'm done.
[240:02.38]I don't think this does anything.
[240:08.34]Whoa!
[240:09.83]Oh, shit!
[240:12.01]Wait, can you go through spider silk?
[240:16.05]Yeah.
[240:22.59]Get down here.
[240:27.03]Get down here, quick!
[240:45.95]Rush to space.
[240:48.46]Aha!
[240:52.08]We're good.
[241:20.25]Hurry before he sees us.
[241:21.79]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
[241:22.97]Before he sees us.
[241:24.99]Go!
[241:25.21]Oh my goddammit.
[241:27.86]That was... This thing's scary.
[241:35.03]Where'd he go?
[242:00.34]Oh my god, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back.
[242:03.08]I thought that was, I didn't think that was a wall.
[242:08.16]Oh, good thing I, I, I, I got his mouth, I got his mouth supped.
[242:13.49]Supped?
[242:14.35]Sewed?
[242:14.69]Shut?
[242:15.95]Whatever.
[242:38.14]Come on!
[242:38.72]I don't know what I need to attach it to.
[242:47.06]We go now?
[242:52.16]Are you fucking kidding me?
[243:31.34]Get over here out of sight out of sight out of sight out of sight.
[243:36.73]I don't know where he is.
[243:50.73]Yeah, I knew he's gonna be like right here.
[244:24.45]God!
[244:25.05]Just press the button, man!
[244:30.11]What the hell are you doing?
[244:35.88]Can you hold this?
[244:54.12]What do I do?
[245:02.07]I'm afraid to go up here
[245:24.28]See?
[245:24.54]That's terrifying.
[245:27.02]Oh, that was right there.
[245:58.28]Shit!
[246:18.18]Just clear everything.
[246:18.96]Clear the whole fucking thing.
[246:20.18]That's actually what I wanted.
[246:28.10]Alright, now pull that down.
[246:29.74]Don't kill me.
[246:34.03]What?
[246:35.53]Why did it not land on the web?
[247:01.37]Quick!
[247:18.88]Hurry up!
[247:20.20]Wait, don't go fast.
[247:21.42]He's going to be right here, isn't he?
[247:22.97]Oi, back up.
[247:37.32]Good.
[247:46.14]Little spider, you made it.
[247:47.46]And you've rescued your boyfriend.
[247:49.78]We're almost ready to go home.
[247:51.16]Vlad is just bringing the airship around now.
[247:53.20]Wait.
[247:54.87]He's coming.
[247:55.31]Watch out.
[248:08.30]What?
[248:09.67]Hold on, little spider.
[248:10.51]We're gonna catch this bird.
[248:12.35]Defeat the bird.
[248:40.60]Whoa!
[248:58.33]Whoa!
[249:01.25]I'm fucking dead!
[249:03.01]Sorry we're late, just picked up a little help on the way.
[249:06.71]Hey, neighbor.
[249:08.31]MechAnt1 reporting for duty.
[249:10.03]This beast doesn't stand a chance.
[249:11.39]We're coming in close now.
[249:12.71]You don't have to... I'm already dead.
[249:13.91]I hit the ground already.
[249:16.71]Let's do this.
[249:28.14]What do you want me to do?
[249:30.48]I didn't read that.
[249:31.79]I didn't read that.
[249:32.35]What do I have to do?
[249:32.89]I didn't read it.
[250:19.99]I'm in position, get clear!
[250:21.05]Detaching mech ant.
[250:25.31]I'm gonna bite his head off.
[250:42.50]Okay, we did it, now we can let go.
[250:45.04]We did it, the beast is grounded.
[250:46.70]What should we do with him now, comrade?
[250:50.00]We send him away.
[250:50.86]You hear me, bird?
[250:52.94]You've burnt all your bridges here.
[250:54.98]The bugs of this bush will not put up with you eating and kidnapping their friends.
[251:00.99]Now we have the means to defend ourselves.
[251:02.83]We need to find a new land to call home.
[251:05.49]Maybe somewhere far away from here with more birds like you.
[251:08.97]Maybe somewhere you can finally find a friend.
[251:13.52]But you leave now, before I change my mind.
[251:26.12]Oh my, that was scary.
[251:29.02]I wasn't sure I'd be able to talk to him, but I did it.
[251:31.78]Thank you, buddy.
[251:33.12]Thank you too, buddy's boyfriend.
[251:35.60]Your brave actions gave me the courage to finally stand up to that menace.
[251:38.30]My home is a little bit safer today, thanks to you.
[251:43.91]I did it!
[251:47.07]That was fun.
[251:49.73]Nice job.
[251:50.91]That was fun.
[251:57.38]Alright, but wait, there's the post-season credits.
[252:11.33]He doesn't know?
[252:11.91]I wish this game had music.
[252:23.42]I turned it down, man.
[252:39.28]Should watch the speedrun.
[252:41.61]What's the, uh... Can one of the mods link the world record?
[252:45.09]I'm curious.
[252:49.41]I'm the second place runner as of a few days ago.
[252:52.10]Rip.
[252:52.44]Oh, wow.
[252:53.08]That's still pretty... That's still awesome, though.
[252:54.50]I mean, that's still... It's ridiculous.
[253:01.96]World record, 1631.
[253:02.66]Is it any percent, or do you... Just any percent.
[253:06.59]Any percent.
[253:08.22]Well, hold on.
[253:08.92]This is cute.
[253:10.48]And you as Buddy the spider.
[253:21.05]How come that bird's so nice?
[253:27.01]Why was the crow so mean?
[253:28.11]Why was the marshmallow one so nice?
[253:35.62]Oh, hold on.
[253:41.54]Baby?
[253:44.57]Baby?
[253:44.83]Is that a baby spider?
[253:52.91]What is it?
[253:53.23]A baby?
[253:56.31]Oh, it's babies.
[253:57.19]A lot of babies.
[254:01.50]Where do we go now?
[254:08.96]Very cool.
[254:26.44]What's through here?
[254:26.90]Is it just free roam now?
[254:31.63]It's probably just free roam.
[254:38.13]Oh, hold on.
[254:49.32]So, do you get a... What do I get for this?
[255:01.92]Give me a hat.
[255:02.34]Whatever.
[255:06.18]Yeah, let me put the speedrun on.
[255:07.36]I'm very curious about this.
[255:12.59]I'm going to have to watch the whole thing.
[255:20.09]We do not have to watch the whole thing.
[255:21.49]It's only 16 minutes.
[255:42.85]Hold on, let's get a good view.
[255:53.86]Okay.
[255:57.76]So you use propulsion?
[256:13.35]What?
[256:23.73]You just throw yourself down and you use the laser for propulsion.
[256:28.86]I can't tell what's happening.
[256:38.78]Wow.
[256:43.66]This is really a pretty... I would say this is probably a pretty good speedrunning game, right?
[256:49.10]There's not a whole lot of... It's a lot of just go get that thing and put it over here.
[256:56.87]Do you even have to help anybody?
[256:58.21]Actually, I think you have to.
[257:00.09]To get the hot air balloon, right?
[257:08.17]Does the movement speed stack?
[257:09.41]Does it have a cap?
[257:10.73]Or can you just actually fly and throw yourself around?
[257:19.60]Look at that.
[257:22.76]It's about getting a good angle and the central mechanic.
[257:25.16]Yeah.
[257:28.12]This is definitely a speedrunning game.
[257:29.44]What the hell was that?
[257:37.08]What?
[257:40.66]This is an actual spider.
[257:41.98]Yeah, this really is an actual spider.
[257:52.38]I'm curious about the, that, wow, that was close.
[258:06.39]That's so cool.
[258:06.97]Alright.
[258:10.53]What about, I want to see up here.
[258:29.24]What, on break core?
[258:32.40]I want to see one of these.
[258:33.40]I want to see what happens at the end here.
[258:36.71]You just... You just... You just drag.
[258:40.25]Dude.
[258:55.56]What?
[258:56.16]How are you even supposed to do that?
[259:05.87]Alright, that was pretty cool.
[259:06.62]Alright, here comes the fight with the bird.
[259:17.20]How do you do this fast?
[259:29.94]Oh, you guys can even hear it.
[259:39.32]What?
[259:42.32]Wait, what just happened?
[259:48.38]Don't you have to web the bird?
[259:55.54]It's a skip.
[259:57.74]Wow.
[260:03.34]Well, there it is.
[260:04.20]Congratulations.
[260:04.98]This is your world record.
[260:09.00]That's really cool.
[260:10.62]That's so cool.
[260:14.49]This game's got some bugs in it.
[260:15.67]Time that person out for an hour.
[260:29.45]Yeah, link to the speedrun?
[260:31.61]Yeah, we'll link the speedrun.
[260:34.30]Here is a link to the world record, if you'd like to take a look.
[260:40.02]Video that was just on screen.
[260:41.34]That's really cool.
[260:43.87]Alright.
[260:44.87]I think that's it.
[260:51.55]Can we get a baseball update?
[260:53.09]July 14th.
[260:55.84]July 14th.
[260:56.18]Mark it on your calendar.
[260:57.22]Baseball is going to be July 14th.
[260:58.48]Yeah, I don't want to go too, too late.
[261:04.15]impromptu stream here.
[261:05.53]Supposed to be streaming tomorrow, but schedule getting changed.
[261:09.01]I got to take care of Otto.
[261:10.90]So we'll see you later.
[261:11.78]We'll see you again.
[261:12.28]I will see you guys on Saturday.
[261:17.06]We'll do Saturday, Sunday.
[261:19.90]And we'll go a little longer.
[261:21.48]The last two days in a row have been four hour, four and a half hour here.
[261:25.50]I like to stream for at least five to seven hours.
[261:31.25]So we will do some long ones this weekend.
[261:38.69]Four hour Andy.
[261:39.31]Andy.
[261:44.94]That was a cute game.
[261:45.60]I like that a lot.
[261:46.52]That was requested for a while, too.
[261:47.62]That was fun.
[261:49.73]Oh, right.
[261:50.21]Sorry.
[261:50.45]Sorry to every sci-fi fantasy fan of any show ever.
[261:54.77]I feel like you lost a little bit of respect for me tonight.
[261:58.37]Very sorry.
[261:58.91]I want to profusely apologize.
[262:06.75]Very sorry about that.
[262:11.63]We have a lot of fun here, don't we?
[262:15.52]Show the image again.
[262:17.74]This is the one that I still have queued up.
[262:21.04]I really thought that you mashed these two together.
[262:23.20]I don't know.
[262:25.06]I haven't seen, like, really much of either.
[262:27.56]I mean, I've seen Rick and Morty.
[262:28.58]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[262:37.41]Thanks for watching.
[262:38.47]See you soon.
[262:39.23]See you Saturday.
[262:41.51]I will give you an auto-update.
[262:43.89]He's gonna be fine.
[262:45.82]I just want to check him out for a couple of things.
[262:47.98]Things that are at least concerning enough for me to want him to go to the vet.
[262:51.82]So, but he's fine.
[262:54.58]I'll give you an update.
[263:04.38]Good luck, Otto.
[263:08.87]Yeah, good luck, Otto.
[263:12.33]Otto.
[263:18.31]Thanks for the subs.
[263:19.41]Thanks for the bits.
[263:21.97]A lot of subs were coming in today.
[263:23.93]A lot of community subs.
[263:30.03]That was a good... Yeah, it was just fun to... I really like these experiences.
[263:37.16]Games that are between three and five hours, they're almost perfect.
[263:47.41]I love these little bite-sized experiences.
[263:59.33]Hope you had fun.
[264:04.30]I did.
[264:13.84]Small experiences for a small man.
[264:19.31]I'm actually kind of nervous for Dextreme because it's going to be a brand new audio setup and I'm going to sound completely different.
[264:23.80]You guys are going to have to give me some feedback.
[264:29.98]I need to know how it sounds.
[264:32.40]Good or bad.
[264:34.77]What's the schedule?
[264:35.63]Saturday at 4pm Pacific is the next live stream on this channel.
[264:50.95]Get some sleep.
[264:57.01]Take care of yourselves.
[264:57.69]Call your mother.
[265:00.64]You know, usual.
[265:15.12]He said that like four streams in a row now.
[265:23.35]Yeah, Saturday 4 p.m.
[265:24.29]Pacific.
[265:28.39]Good night.
[265:28.75]Take care of yourselves.
[265:31.65]And goodbye.
