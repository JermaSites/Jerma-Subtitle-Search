[00:02.36]We know a little place in the American far west where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes... This is a lot of shit.
[00:13.28]Hey, how you doing, guys?
[00:15.06]Welcome to Monday.
[00:15.98]Hey, we're here.
[00:18.96]We got Monday here.
[00:23.20]Stop streaming.
[00:23.81]I'm catching up on your last one.
[00:26.42]Well, it's just like TV.
[00:28.20]I just called you to dinner.
[00:29.38]You're in the middle of your favorite episode of your television show, and I just said, time for dinner.
[00:34.40]This stream is what's for dinner tonight.
[00:36.54]You can eat your dinner from last night later.
[00:41.33]How long is a little bit?
[00:42.51]We'll probably only... I don't want to make anybody upset about this, but we're only going to be streaming for about, like, three hours tonight.
[00:50.67]I know.
[00:52.43]Get him.
[00:53.17]Get him.
[00:53.59]Bury him.
[00:57.02]I got a lot to do.
[00:58.24]Okay, let me just... Let's break this down.
[01:01.57]Over the next three weeks, I'm gonna have to actually juggle around streams.
[01:09.39]The schedule... Throw the schedule into the garbage can for the next three weeks.
[01:13.37]Because this is the time when I'm getting rid of my house, and I have to have realtor people, and it's gonna be a mess.
[01:23.28]This is the next few weeks here is where...
[01:27.01]I gotta... This is really happening.
[01:28.73]It's really starting to happen.
[01:31.73]Give me your house.
[01:34.39]It's not mine.
[01:38.02]And yeah, I'm gonna address something else too.
[01:39.58]We're gonna go over... Let's take this first, like, 20 minutes.
[01:43.58]Turn the music down.
[01:45.54]The stream is starting soon.
[01:46.70]We're gonna have a little bit in the background just so it's not just me here.
[01:51.71]Let's talk about a couple things.
[01:54.61]Hey, welcome.
[01:55.71]Let's talk.
[01:58.46]You got the overlay for clone drone in the danger zone?
[02:03.92]Wait, you shouldn't be getting that, actually.
[02:06.89]You still have?
[02:07.67]Is that still on screen?
[02:10.03]It's still enabled?
[02:12.11]How do I take it off?
[02:16.15]I already disconnected it.
[02:20.85]Spawn bots.
[02:23.93]I turned off enable access.
[02:26.67]Well...
[02:28.51]Looks like we're spawning swords.
[02:33.08]Yeah, I'll figure that out.
[02:34.24]I'll contact twitch.tv.
[02:36.22]I'll contact GaryTwitch.TV.
[02:38.88]That's the guy's actual name, by the way.
[02:41.50]Here's a little fact.
[02:42.71]Do you know the first person that made twitch.tv?
[02:45.63]His name was actually GaryTwitch.TV, and he wanted to run, so he walked it two times.
[02:50.15]I fucked it up.
[02:50.71]Just whatever.
[02:52.71]I could have done that much better.
[02:55.22]But anyways...
[02:57.49]I'm just going to wait a minute for people to come in here.
[03:02.75]You can minus me on that one.
[03:04.59]I botched that one terribly.
[03:08.58]Let's wait until we get a minute or two to go by.
[03:10.86]Because, yes.
[03:14.88]I want to make sure I reiterate that again.
[03:17.62]Starting today is...
[03:21.45]house cleaning uh throwing stuff in trash I have to donate stuff oh god somebody please come into my house am I can I get out of this who's who's gonna how do I sell buy new place where am I going where is it Nevada okay get there I need to buy it I need to play how much is that it's there's gonna be very hectic so yeah I've I just I just said it but I'm gonna say it one more time
[03:51.79]I'm going to try to stream when I can here from here going forward.
[03:56.64]We're still going to get the same, you know, it's not going to be like, yeah, see you guys in a month.
[04:01.11]No.
[04:01.85]I'll be streaming at least twice a week here.
[04:05.45]Sometimes three to four times, but it's just going to be whenever I can.
[04:09.32]For instance, like right now, it's Monday.
[04:11.50]It's currently seven o'clock on Monday.
[04:12.98]I have time right now.
[04:14.38]This is not a scheduled day.
[04:15.58]I just knew I was going to have time today.
[04:17.56]I know I'm going to have a little bit of time tomorrow, but after tomorrow, I'm going to have like two or three days where I can't do anything.
[04:24.99]I know the dumb extension is still on, but I can't turn it off.
[04:27.57]Hold on.
[04:27.93]I'm going to go into extensions.
[04:29.87]See if I can turn it off from here.
[04:33.12]My extensions.
[04:35.28]Oh, I got it, I got it.
[04:36.60]Okay, no, I had it still on.
[04:40.29]I actually still had it turned on.
[04:42.37]That was my bad.
[04:43.53]Just refresh the page.
[04:48.55]Oh no, all your coins.
[04:52.11]But, we got, okay, it's time to start talking about stuff.
[04:56.15]Thing number one.
[04:57.53]The emote contest is... The submissions are over.
[05:01.18]You can no longer give any submissions.
[05:03.52]Thank you, everybody that gave submissions.
[05:05.92]Me and a bunch of the mods.
[05:07.83]We did a first pass-through.
[05:09.29]So...
[05:11.47]If you give a submission and you don't see it tomorrow, that's not because, oh my god, he must not have seen it.
[05:17.00]No, it's because it either didn't work, it didn't show up well enough, or it just wasn't something that I wanted to have on the channel.
[05:26.01]There was a reason why it was either axed in the first pass here.
[05:28.95]So, very important couple of things to talk about with the emote contest.
[05:32.71]Tomorrow, that's the whole stream.
[05:36.28]It was bad.
[05:37.08]No, but look, it's not because it was bad.
[05:40.43]It just, quotation mark, it just didn't fit in with the current use case of the twitch.tv emote program on Jerma985.
[05:51.25]End quotation.
[05:52.09]There you go.
[05:52.45]There's your, you can use that wherever you want.
[05:59.40]But anyways, tomorrow, that's the whole stream.
[06:02.96]We're going to go one by one, piece by piece.
[06:06.24]There are, it's going to be like 30 or 40 things to pick from here.
[06:10.63]So we're going to go through, we're going to sip a little bit of fucking gin.
[06:15.01]And we're going to, don't drink gin, it's disgusting.
[06:18.13]I don't drink gin.
[06:19.42]We're going to go over, we're going to figure out which ones we're going to use.
[06:21.30]So that's what's going on tomorrow.
[06:22.38]That's the whole stream tomorrow.
[06:23.46]It's going to take like a couple hours to do that.
[06:26.04]The voting starts tomorrow.
[06:27.51]We're going to vote.
[06:28.11]You're going to be able to vote five times for your five favorite ones.
[06:32.67]And whichever ones the top five get the most votes over the course of a week, by the way, it's not happening tomorrow.
[06:40.71]So the poll is going to start tomorrow, but it's not going to close for like five days.
[06:47.15]That's to make sure that people that don't come to tomorrow's stream.
[06:50.37]Oh, wait, hold on.
[06:51.92]You did that whole thing.
[06:56.29]Can we only put one vote?
[06:57.59]You can vote for one or five.
[06:59.77]But I want to give people up to five because there's going to be five slots.
[07:02.60]Five emotes are being picked.
[07:09.68]Just joined.
[07:10.28]What vote?
[07:10.80]Alright.
[07:11.08]Hold on.
[07:11.36]Let's start it again.
[07:13.04]okay here we go tomorrow we're starting the voting process for the emotes it's going to last about a week so therefore people that don't see tomorrow's stream they still get to pick an emote that they like five emotes they're I know one guy that was the one guy it's gonna be you one day you know that so that's what we're doing tomorrow I will explain in more detail tomorrow that whole thing
[07:38.77]Thing number two to talk about before we start playing Wreckfest.
[07:41.21]Yes, Etalyx is moving to Vegas.
[07:45.19]He announced it last night.
[07:47.90]We've been talking about it.
[07:48.74]We've been working on it.
[07:49.88]Etalyx is moving to Vegas.
[07:53.38]We're going to live in the same place.
[07:55.56]Now, I've seen a couple of comments talking about this, and I'm going to address them right now.
[08:00.98]No, Etalyx and I are not moving into a place together to be a comedy team.
[08:07.26]This is not like a, okay guys, and now you're going to get a bunch of prank videos and, oh wait, he's streaming right now, we're going to throw an egg into his room.
[08:14.15]No.
[08:14.91]Like, we're not going to change our content simply because we're moving into the same place, right?
[08:22.41]A lot of people think that it's all of a sudden going to turn into, okay guys, welcome to the Jerma and Italic show on every fucking single stream.
[08:30.01]No.
[08:32.64]We're going to keep our separate channels...
[08:36.05]We do different things.
[08:37.63]Obviously, there'll be more opportunity to do co-op stuff.
[08:40.61]Make co-op things.
[08:42.75]But don't expect all of a sudden, just because we're living in the same place, that, hey, now it's... The comedy team!
[08:53.94]He comes by the curtain and starts fucking dancing and shit.
[08:56.06]No.
[09:02.86]But that's that.
[09:04.14]That is true.
[09:04.68]That's a real statement.
[09:08.88]And yes, Kim is coming as well.
[09:11.50]So there are three of us are going there.
[09:16.02]This is not like... You understand, right?
[09:19.74]I don't need to say anymore.
[09:24.86]But let me quell that whole idea.
[09:28.86]about how people think that all of a sudden now we're going to share channels.
[09:32.80]No, we're just going to happen.
[09:34.22]And look, I'm going to give you let's like break down the let's remove like let's get the comedy spirit out of here and let's talk for real.
[09:42.22]Moving across the country is obviously it's a big deal, right?
[09:46.48]It's like it's something I've never done before.
[09:48.85]And you're leaving everything behind.
[09:50.87]All my friends, all my family, like my nieces, my nephews.
[09:54.89]These are people that I'm not going to see anymore.
[09:56.55]And going to a completely foreign place
[09:59.26]It's obviously a lot easier when you go with a friend.
[10:02.63]And, you know, hey, I want to do something.
[10:05.09]What can we do?
[10:06.49]Oh, there's a person here.
[10:07.93]You know what I mean?
[10:08.77]That I know.
[10:10.53]It makes it a lot easier.
[10:11.71]Same thing with Kim.
[10:13.07]So going to a place that we're all so foreign to makes it a lot easier.
[10:21.41]What about Otto?
[10:22.01]Otto is coming too.
[10:23.37]Absolutely.
[10:24.83]I would never leave that dog behind.
[10:26.09]He's like literally my best friend.
[10:30.35]but it makes it a lot easier.
[10:33.27]That whole process is more comfortable, right?
[10:38.88]And this is just a short timeframe timeline here.
[10:43.30]When I first was talking about moving to the West Coast, I was only planning on going alone or maybe with like a girlfriend, right?
[10:51.14]If that was still the case.
[10:53.60]And then the more it became a reality, it was like, I'm gonna float it out to other people.
[10:57.24]Maybe other people would wanna go.
[10:59.68]Because remember back in the whole Warner Brothers thing when I was like went out to Warner Brothers in Machinima and that fell through completely.
[11:04.69]I still wanted to go out there.
[11:08.67]So it's nice to go with people you know.
[11:11.84]And cut the bills in half.
[11:14.42]Cut the bills in quarters, right?
[11:16.84]It works out for everybody.
[11:18.84]It's just a smart thing to do.
[11:20.92]Until two months into us living together and I start to hate his guts.
[11:25.09]And I rip our agreement in half and I move to somewhere else.
[11:29.83]Or, you know, he moves somewhere else.
[11:35.83]Alright, get the comedy spirit back in.
[11:38.53]Oh, he got it already.
[11:40.10]He got it already.
[11:44.97]So, that's that.
[11:47.99]Why don't we play a video game, right?
[11:49.31]Because that's what we're doing here on twitch.tv.
[11:52.97]Tomorrow, again, the emote voting is tomorrow.
[11:55.55]I'm going to have a bunch.
[11:56.31]It's going to take some work.
[11:57.03]I'm going to put some stuff in place to make it so it's fun and interesting.
[12:03.21]Or maybe it's just an absolute fucking disaster.
[12:05.33]And then, whatever.
[12:07.37]You know what I mean?
[12:08.09]Who cares?
[12:09.19]Oh, no!
[12:09.83]Shit!
[12:10.05]Wait a minute.
[12:10.64]Hold on.
[12:14.16]There are going to be prizes.
[12:15.40]Ah, sh- God damn it.
[12:16.50]Hold on.
[12:17.04]Fucking... Okay.
[12:22.76]So, there are going to be prizes on that emote contest.
[12:25.47]And here's what the prizes are going to be.
[12:27.97]The five people that get their emote chosen.
[12:31.63]The five people.
[12:33.75]They are going to choose...
[12:36.75]Between a... And remember that you're going to get a code for this.
[12:41.20]You can choose from your choice a Steam card or an Amazon card.
[12:46.56]$50.
[12:48.54]So every person that wins is going to get one $50 Amazon or Steam gift card.
[12:53.45]So that's like 50-50-50, right?
[12:55.59]Everyone's going to get it.
[12:56.21]That's what it is.
[12:58.39]Steam gift card, Amazon gift card, whatever you choose.
[13:00.58]I will just DM it to you on Discord when we get that settled.
[13:05.00]But that's prizes.
[13:06.72]We've got prizes here.
[13:12.36]They get to live in... No, I'm not going to say that out loud.
[13:16.58]What if they just donate it back?
[13:17.90]Well, that's up to them.
[13:20.04]I can't stop them from doing that.
[13:22.36]But how would you donate me a Steam gift card code?
[13:25.39]That doesn't make any sense.
[13:29.69]That's USD.
[13:30.47]Well, no, it wouldn't be USD.
[13:31.71]Yeah, well, actually, yeah, it would.
[13:33.23]That would be a $50 USD Amazon or Steam gift card.
[13:35.95]Your choice.
[13:39.91]They just gift a game.
[13:40.88]No, I told you.
[13:41.64]I'm not doing that.
[13:44.88]Yeah, this is the next card game.
[13:45.92]It's done.
[13:46.30]It's called Wreckfest now.
[13:50.16]For what?
[13:50.50]That was for emotes.
[13:51.32]Whoever wins the... Whoever the five people are that win the emote contest.
[13:58.37]You know, I was joking, we were like joking about shit in the, uh, when I was talking to the mods about this, like, last night, the night before.
[14:05.73]I was gonna do, like, if I was gonna give all the winners, like, $40 or $50 in Ethereum, like, have separate Ethereum addresses that, like, you have, like, hey, take it and you gotta figure it out.
[14:16.34]But then, like, they immediately corrected me and said that that would be very bad because people don't know how to fucking use those things and they might, like, lose the money, like,
[14:26.28]Like, I was gonna have, like, a little thing where it's like, oh, here's your, like, special code for your Ethereum.
[14:32.42]I just want the money, man.
[14:33.82]Like, I don't want to, like, go through to, like, send it to cash it out or whatever.
[14:41.86]Ether...
[14:46.54]A jar of dirt would be more valuable.
[14:48.26]What are you talking about?
[14:48.98]Did you see that rebound?
[14:50.38]It's rebounded like 25, 10%, 15% over the last two days.
[14:54.48]We're coming back in a bull market, baby.
[15:00.24]What's going on with my controller?
[15:01.20]Alright.
[15:01.79]So here we go.
[15:03.85]I want to at least attempt to see how to play this game.
[15:08.75]If that makes any sense.
[15:09.53]And now what happened to my controller?
[15:12.51]There we go.
[15:13.91]So, I just... We're gonna play multiplayer.
[15:16.57]Do I... I'm assuming... Okay, here we go.
[15:19.89]Uh, we got New York.
[15:21.37]We got... I'm assuming we should probably go on the... Last Man Standing, 0 out of 24, Boston Wreckfest.
[15:26.63]I'm going in.
[15:29.85]This is Wreckfest, if you have it.
[15:31.19]Then we're going to that one that I just clicked on.
[15:33.05]Oh, we're real prepared today.
[15:43.09]Did I lose my chat again?
[15:46.83]Please join us.
[15:49.02]Okay, did this already fill up?
[15:51.16]What the fuck?
[15:54.16]This already filled up.
[15:56.76]Why do I keep losing my chat room?
[15:58.14]Hold on.
[16:04.34]Why does my chat suck so much?
[16:06.74]No, no, no, not you guys.
[16:08.22]You guys don't suck.
[16:11.04]That was a very, very poor way to word that.
[16:13.92]I mean, like, why does my chat room, like, break?
[16:18.34]Hold on, I think, like, I think chat is just offline.
[16:22.15]Oh.
[16:25.01]Hello?
[16:31.41]Oh, there it is.
[16:31.91]Ah, that was weird.
[16:35.55]Alright, let's go.
[16:37.29]Last man standing.
[16:37.99]I haven't played Wreckfest, I haven't played Last Car Game in a long time.
[16:40.53]60 seconds to start the match.
[16:44.27]I heard it's done now and I heard it's fun.
[16:45.85]Can you hear me now?
[16:49.28]Yeah, I can.
[16:50.14]I can hear you guys now.
[16:56.00]Oh, wait a minute.
[16:56.42]I think these are bots.
[16:58.14]At least some of them are.
[16:59.38]How can you tell who's not a bot?
[17:02.11]Is there a way to see who's not a bot?
[17:05.21]Oh, okay, that's how.
[17:07.96]They don't have a ping of 1.
[17:09.02]Alright, it's me, Cheese81, and... Here we go!
[17:17.40]Race is... We're restarting!
[17:21.85]This is one of... This is the Boston, um... Boston Wreckfest Demolition Derby.
[17:28.09]This is loud.
[17:28.77]Fucking loud.
[17:33.21]Oh my god, this is loud.
[17:34.15]We'll fix it in a bit.
[17:45.62]I can't handle this.
[17:46.20]Is that better?
[17:54.51]I think that's better.
[17:58.13]What direction am I facing?
[18:06.46]Alright, we're gonna have to try... We're gonna have to try a thing where... Now it's not loud enough?
[18:18.21]Am I still alive?
[18:20.29]Health is bottom left, I see, okay.
[18:26.98]Look at this, I've... This game has so much car damage, I'm going for this one.
[18:29.42]And these could be louder?
[18:39.87]Master call even one percent.
[18:41.53]No one's going to come over here.
[18:44.14]I'll just hide here for a minute.
[18:45.26]There we go, right?
[18:57.97]I think I lost.
[18:58.67]Alright, I'm in position 14.
[19:10.43]Now it's too quiet.
[19:11.23]Well, we'll figure it out.
[19:13.87]Now let me go back.
[19:14.43]Hold on.
[19:14.75]Wait, wait, wait.
[19:15.07]Quit multiplayer for a second.
[19:20.59]Create a custom single player event.
[19:22.13]No, multiplayer event.
[19:23.49]I want to do a race.
[19:26.69]Okay, see?
[19:27.15]You guys see this one right here?
[19:28.99]This is the one you need to join.
[19:30.03]Boston Wreckfest, Rosenheim Raceway, Elimination Race, 3 cars, 0 out of 20.
[19:35.25]That's the one you need to go to if you're going to play this one right here.
[19:42.48]No one owns this game?
[19:44.30]They don't?
[19:44.66]Yeah, they do.
[19:48.11]Isn't this game like a popular game?
[19:52.87]Does nobody actually own this?
[19:54.41]Yes, you do.
[19:55.05]Somebody does.
[19:55.57]Alright, Mr. Fox.
[20:05.06]Yeah, we'll hang out here for a second.
[20:12.94]I don't, but I really want it.
[20:14.42]I own every copy.
[20:16.88]How much is it?
[20:17.36]I think it's like 15, 20 bucks maybe?
[20:19.20]Yeah, people are coming in.
[20:21.74]We're good.
[20:22.02]Yeah, there's people playing right now.
[20:26.66]That guy's ping.
[20:34.03]Yeah, I think everyone has terrible ping when you first come in.
[20:36.29]Alright, Rat Boys.
[20:37.49]That's definitely somebody watching the stream.
[20:41.26]We're alright.
[20:42.28]Where am I?
[20:42.72]39 ping.
[20:46.06]So this is a race, right?
[20:48.77]Let me select my car.
[20:52.67]I can't have this one?
[20:54.49]I can't get in the clown car?
[20:55.87]Come on.
[20:56.49]How much is it?
[20:59.05]It's just locked.
[20:59.77]I don't have anything.
[21:01.80]I need to make some money to get a new car.
[21:04.10]But I can have any car.
[21:13.77]Is that for real?
[21:18.11]It's selected.
[21:18.85]Tune.
[21:22.38]Suspension.
[21:23.48]Stiff.
[21:27.36]Gear ratio.
[21:28.38]I'm going to do... We're going to do short.
[21:30.89]Differential.
[21:32.03]I'm open to all kinds of ideas.
[21:33.83]Brake balance.
[21:35.15]We want rear wheel brakes.
[21:38.14]Difficulty.
[21:39.16]Shifting.
[21:39.58]Automatic.
[21:40.60]Nobody drives manuals anymore.
[21:43.78]Aim balance sights.
[21:46.65]On is fine.
[21:48.19]Traction control, that's fine.
[21:49.31]Stability control is full.
[21:50.21]I think we're good.
[21:50.99]Alright, let's see what we got here.
[21:53.49]Volume loud.
[21:54.63]Yeah, volume fucking loud.
[21:55.85]Alright, what we got?
[21:58.37]Not very many more people have to join.
[22:01.77]Just 1,200 ping.
[22:03.07]Not a big deal.
[22:06.58]No, I'm not going to turn it up louder.
[22:11.74]This game is 45 bucks?
[22:13.38]Oh man, is it really?
[22:16.34]That's a lot of money.
[22:18.24]Okay, I'm ready.
[22:18.84]Let's go.
[22:20.96]We got enough people here now.
[22:22.42]We got pretty much a full lobby.
[22:24.28]Game's gonna start in 60 seconds.
[22:29.48]Or no, it's not.
[22:33.90]How do I... Ready.
[22:35.17]Start.
[22:37.09]Start.
[22:40.51]Ready up!
[22:41.65]You guys have to R up.
[22:45.81]The game was cheaper before it released.
[22:47.79]I think I actually bought this game for $24.99.
[22:48.89]I'm going to press enter.
[23:01.74]Why?
[23:02.47]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[23:04.25]I think everyone has to R up here.
[23:08.93]You get kicked out if you don't ready up.
[23:11.27]I'm readied up.
[23:12.90]I don't own this server, so I can't just start it.
[23:18.10]Kick some people.
[23:20.90]There we go.
[23:21.72]Alright, enough people are it up.
[23:24.86]This is a race, so main circuit, laps, elimination race.
[23:29.46]20 players.
[23:32.36]Damage is normal.
[23:34.04]So just win the race.
[23:34.78]I'll try.
[23:37.28]Make your own server?
[23:39.24]Um, I don't think I can.
[23:41.60]Is that through Steam, or is that, like, I don't have... That would be impossible unless it was through Steam.
[23:50.84]I don't have, like, a dedicated server for the game.
[23:52.22]Is that on what place he comes in?
[23:56.08]Well, there's 20 people, so I'm gonna say... If I come... How about this?
[23:58.76]I win if I come between... If I come between, like, 12 and 17, then I win.
[24:10.91]Yeah, if I get to like 16 or 15, then I win.
[24:19.77]Yes.
[24:21.57]I win.
[24:22.07]I just win the race.
[24:25.93]You're being very generous.
[24:27.81]Alright, here we go.
[24:30.27]There's the turbo button.
[24:31.37]L1, L2.
[24:39.58]Alright, I had to do that.
[24:40.50]What's the break?
[24:45.04]Smell ya later!
[24:45.60]Am I in five?
[24:48.03]I'm doing well.
[24:56.03]Is it like a drift button?
[24:56.81]I didn't even do the tutorial!
[25:03.03]Is there a... We gotta slow way down.
[25:12.40]I was gonna say, why am I trying to press triangle?
[25:14.88]Or why?
[25:15.44]To dive out of the car.
[25:18.50]That seems pretty bad.
[25:19.48]That seems like a stupid idea.
[25:22.68]Oh, fuck, that did it.
[25:23.63]Okay, that's... Ah!
[25:25.49]No, that's the Yoshi's of Circuit shortcut.
[25:27.97]Goddammit.
[25:30.81]No, don't follow the herd.
[25:33.39]Oh, Ratboy's been eliminated.
[25:36.59]He's dead.
[25:37.81]What's my damage?
[25:38.57]I'm at 76% damage.
[25:46.51]This guy in the mustard car is just blocking me.
[25:49.45]I do have to turn it down again, don't I?
[25:54.16]Oh, fuck!
[25:54.64]I tried to... I tried to sideswipe him when I got to 66.
[25:59.08]Sounds good, man.
[26:12.17]Sounds good, man.
[26:15.04]Let's turn the car engines down.
[26:16.22]Alright, I'll turn the car engines down again.
[26:25.01]That guy's dead.
[26:27.88]I'm at 4 out of 12.
[26:28.76]That means I win.
[26:29.70]I guess car's gonna explode.
[26:33.48]Big money?
[26:34.54]Oh, sure, we got big money here.
[26:35.60]Hold on.
[26:35.84]I'm just getting first place score.
[26:42.01]Speed too high for car reset.
[26:43.49]Oh no, that's not what I'm trying to do.
[26:46.47]I gotta figure out, like, the drift button.
[26:50.72]Fucking goddammit.
[26:51.82]That's what I get.
[26:52.56]That's what I... That's what I deserve.
[26:59.36]What the fuck are those guys?
[27:05.16]Ugh.
[27:09.76]Now I turned into the brave little toaster.
[27:13.49]Cards.
[27:15.43]Remember the car graveyard?
[27:16.57]That really terrifying, fucked up part of that movie?
[27:33.84]What the fuck am I doing?
[27:39.06]How am I going the wrong way?
[27:42.61]How is this the wrong way?
[27:43.59]Why am I going the wrong way?
[27:44.65]This is not the wrong way.
[27:49.07]How is this incorrect?
[27:57.16]Resetting?
[28:11.75]Okay.
[28:13.05]Hey, I came in 11th place.
[28:14.03]I win the race.
[28:14.55]Let's go.
[28:15.01]Let's keep... Can I move to a different person?
[28:20.77]What can I do?
[28:21.23]Is this the only person left?
[28:39.39]No, there's still people in the race.
[28:41.21]Spectate.
[28:42.15]I want to spectate somebody else.
[28:44.05]That's me.
[28:54.32]This is past me.
[28:58.26]Oh, follow car.
[28:58.98]Here we go.
[28:59.34]Follow car.
[29:00.04]Let's follow this guy.
[29:03.55]Alright.
[29:03.83]Alright.
[29:04.15]Drag.
[29:04.77]Drag.
[29:07.27]Did he paint, like, Ray's Hell on the side of his... Yeah, Ray's Hell.
[29:15.22]Bad driver.
[29:17.14]No, I'm a good driver.
[29:18.82]What place is this guy in?
[29:19.64]Three?
[29:24.61]Alright, let's, like, hide everything.
[29:28.91]This guy's just doing a good job driving.
[29:39.83]Yeah, he's got that Austin 3, 16, raise hell.
[29:42.75]Alright, this guy's just doing well.
[29:47.53]Can we find somebody else?
[29:48.43]There we go.
[29:56.62]This guy's currently in fifth out of seven.
[29:58.94]People don't even make it through.
[30:06.26]This is just people driving.
[30:08.16]What does his say?
[30:12.70]He's got 68.
[30:13.30]68, uh, haha.
[30:14.50]What does it say on the right?
[30:17.20]68, haha.
[30:20.76]Fresh cabbage.
[30:24.18]I couldn't read it.
[30:24.78]I don't know what it says.
[30:32.81]I thought this guy was trying to hit people.
[30:36.67]How long is this race?
[30:39.19]This race is too long.
[30:46.75]That's the crusher.
[30:49.41]Austin fucking 415, say, I just crushed your ass.
[30:51.97]Uh-oh, Ray's hell.
[30:56.62]Ray's hell's in trouble here.
[30:58.98]Both the Steve Austin cars just ramming into each other.
[31:01.26]Red just passed Blue here.
[31:04.48]Come on, you gotta raise some hell, man.
[31:13.18]Oh, he didn't.
[31:13.72]Oh, he's going fast.
[31:17.43]I don't know why this car is reminding me of Goofy from Disney.
[31:20.27]I don't know why.
[31:21.09]Why is that?
[31:24.13]Anybody else getting Goofy vibes from this guy's car?
[31:30.43]Let's go back to race hell.
[31:38.54]This is still going.
[31:41.36]It's still going.
[31:42.12]This race is still happening.
[31:46.39]Uh-oh, Ray's Hell just passed Goofy.
[31:48.79]Goofy coming up the rear here.
[31:51.15]No, that's not Goofy, that's 68 Cabbage.
[31:53.01]68 Cabbage coming up on Ray's Hell.
[31:57.29]Right behind him, tailing right on his ass here.
[31:59.58]He's going to go right to the left side here.
[32:00.82]No, he's going to go to the side.
[32:03.14]Oh!
[32:04.42]Smashed right into the buckets of water.
[32:07.32]And he gets out on top.
[32:09.28]Ray's Hell just cannot.
[32:10.47]No, he's going to go around the left side.
[32:12.25]Same thing.
[32:14.16]No, no, no!
[32:17.99]That's a good Mighty Man.
[32:24.69]Mighty Number... No, that's Mighty Number 9.
[32:27.79]He accidentally brought it upside down.
[32:31.99]And we got Mighty Number 9, who's in second place.
[32:35.85]Uh... 58 Cabbage.
[32:39.41]This is very long.
[32:40.89]Like, I don't know what to do here.
[32:42.77]We have to just watch this whole thing.
[32:48.00]Who is this?
[32:49.52]Why is this guy in first place?
[32:52.50]Why are you still in first place?
[32:56.22]That is goofy.
[32:59.63]It's an elimination by meters.
[33:02.25]It's elimination, not a race.
[33:03.91]What, is this gonna just go on forever?
[33:07.48]What if... What if this never ends?
[33:13.06]Alright, Mighty No.
[33:13.94]9 currently in second place here.
[33:15.92]Just driving in a circle.
[33:17.18]It's a survivor race.
[33:20.31]Elimination in... Uh-oh.
[33:22.39]Wait a minute.
[33:24.53]1,000 meters here.
[33:26.47]Goofy's in trouble.
[33:27.13]Goofy, you gotta make something happen here, man.
[33:28.56]Otherwise, you're gone.
[33:36.54]Yeah, he's screwed.
[33:37.44]He can't do anything.
[33:37.94]He might as well just drive straight into this car.
[33:41.02]Sorry, Goofy.
[33:43.41]Two.
[33:45.47]One.
[33:46.85]Zero.
[33:47.41]Here he comes.
[33:48.35]One second remaining.
[33:51.13]One meter of seconds remaining.
[33:52.97]Can he do anything about it?
[33:54.07]I don't think he can.
[33:54.89]Goodbye.
[33:55.39]Here are the last two.
[33:57.73]No, that's it.
[33:58.65]There's only two people left.
[34:02.04]He's gone in 1,200 meters.
[34:06.26]Line number nine is currently too far away, I think, to do anything significant here.
[34:12.44]So let's remind ourselves to not do the elimination race.
[34:17.32]You probably shouldn't be playing with your wheel.
[34:19.44]You have one of those whole setups.
[34:25.58]We're just watching somebody drive in a circle.
[34:30.62]Seriously.
[34:32.09]We're not going to do elimination again.
[34:34.09]We're going to make sure we don't do this one.
[34:40.00]Two seconds.
[34:40.96]Three, two, one, boom.
[34:42.40]Okay, that's the end.
[34:44.22]Back to lobby.
[34:48.66]Back to lobby in 14 seconds.
[34:50.05]I don't think I can change it.
[34:54.13]Figure eight.
[34:54.77]We'll find, like, an interesting one.
[34:58.09]That was a 10-minute fucking race.
[35:01.62]That's more exciting than NASCAR.
[35:03.44]Yeah, I got 540 CR, whatever that means.
[35:08.29]Alright, so I don't think we can change this.
[35:11.75]Yeah, I'm going back.
[35:15.63]Let's go back to the main menu.
[35:16.67]Let's find an interesting thing to do.
[35:20.00]Multiplayer.
[35:21.98]Alright, we got elimination race.
[35:23.66]I ain't doing that again.
[35:24.46]This is last man standing.
[35:29.26]This is also... This is a banger race.
[35:33.01]Deathmatch.
[35:35.15]Banger race.
[35:35.51]Deathmatch.
[35:37.61]This is three laps, banger race, 0 out of 18.
[35:40.67]Official US server 2.
[35:41.83]All vehicles.
[35:42.33]Let's try this one.
[35:49.18]These are all in Boston, apparently.
[35:51.90]Is this online?
[35:52.46]Yes, it is.
[35:52.80]Alright, so let's select a car.
[36:00.40]I can select anything.
[36:01.74]All cars are unlocked.
[36:04.88]Let's go with...
[36:07.62]This is American midsize RWD.
[36:12.18]Can I get a truck or something?
[36:17.34]I mean, why wouldn't I do that?
[36:21.88]Why wouldn't I be in the lawnmower?
[36:26.12]Okay.
[36:30.70]Do you get a school bus?
[36:31.74]Yeah, that one's coming up next.
[36:37.17]School bus.
[36:38.51]US official East 2.
[36:41.00]Ready up.
[36:41.98]Let me tune it up a little bit though.
[36:43.42]Tuning is disabled.
[36:45.62]Shifting automatic.
[36:47.16]Full traction control.
[36:48.28]No, I want like full control.
[36:51.14]Maybe not.
[36:53.08]Alright, I'm readied up.
[36:56.31]I'm ready.
[36:57.99]R up.
[37:00.33]This is just a regular race.
[37:05.03]Maximum power.
[37:07.62]I already have max power.
[37:12.76]Full.
[37:13.56]Full control.
[37:14.32]Full control.
[37:15.60]Shifting.
[37:16.20]Full control.
[37:17.00]Manual clutch.
[37:17.80]There's no clutch on a lawnmower.
[37:22.85]Yeah, I really like to take out around my manual lawnmower.
[37:26.27]How obnoxious would that be?
[37:34.35]Not on your lawnmower.
[37:35.57]No, not on anybody's lawnmower.
[37:39.11]Don't you guys understand?
[37:39.89]A lawnmower only has two speeds.
[37:42.51]Turtle and rabbit.
[37:45.28]And if you're right in the middle, you're about as fast as halfway between turtle and rabbit.
[37:50.46]That's it.
[37:55.27]Don't talk to me about manual control on a lawnmower.
[38:07.58]It's really easy for you to die on the lawnmower.
[38:12.46]Maybe for you, but I mean, I'm pretty good.
[38:16.03]I'm pretty great at video games.
[38:26.64]It has a clutch but no gears.
[38:28.08]Yeah, but you're not going like 40 on a lawnmower.
[38:34.72]The turtle always wins.
[38:36.89]Yes.
[38:37.85]The rabbit is too busy doing coke and sprinting while the turtle is just sipping on whiskey slowly and enjoying his evening.
[38:49.40]Alright.
[38:52.74]Watch this.
[38:55.73]You don't think I'm far?
[39:01.09]You think I'm stupid?
[39:04.77]What?
[39:26.68]Everybody has one.
[39:28.24]I was trying to avoid the... No, don't go back to the game.
[39:31.96]I'm losing my mind here.
[39:34.86]Close the hut.
[39:41.90]I was trying to avoid the herd and get out of the way.
[39:46.71]Somebody's in a school bus.
[39:48.15]How are you guys in first place?
[39:50.19]That doesn't make any fucking sense.
[39:52.12]You guys are three animals being chased by a giant monster.
[39:55.62]That is the school bus.
[39:57.14]Look at that monster that's gonna kill everybody.
[40:06.33]I wish I had the camera view better on me.
[40:08.87]Look at this monster!
[40:10.89]You better get out of the way.
[40:19.26]Dude, where's the mods to have the monster have loud, screaming, angry noises?
[40:32.91]This is just... We're watching Planet Earth right now.
[40:38.62]That guy with the deep British accent is talking about...
[40:48.80]Anybody else?
[40:51.92]David Axelrod.
[40:54.69]What's his name?
[40:56.35]Don Axelrod?
[40:57.79]What's that guy's name?
[40:59.29]David Attenrod?
[41:06.68]Attenborough.
[41:08.42]David Attenborough.
[41:19.03]I can't... Okay, that was fucking funny.
[41:24.59]Alright, guys.
[41:25.27]You want to play?
[41:25.85]Somebody just got run over.
[41:26.63]That was a body that got run over.
[41:33.98]Alright, let me... I love how it cut right to that guy's face, too.
[41:39.90]That was perfect.
[41:42.36]Yeah, lawnmower only.
[41:43.90]And we will vault kick you if you do not do it.
[41:59.47]David Axelrod was the chief strategist for the Obama administration.
[42:06.99]That's completely incorrect.
[42:12.83]All Wanmo and one bus.
[42:14.27]That's actually a great idea.
[42:21.11]I'll get to be the boss.
[42:23.89]No, no, no.
[42:24.69]I don't want to be the boss.
[42:25.43]I want to be part of the herd that's running away from the giant wolf.
[42:32.71]That was fucking fun.
[42:33.40]Alright, same deal, guys.
[42:35.82]You know what to do.
[42:39.14]Why is it already destroyed?
[42:40.06]Okay, it had to be repaired.
[42:45.98]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[42:47.80]What's going on here?
[42:55.34]Did it already start?
[42:58.00]Oh, a new map.
[42:58.70]Okay.
[43:00.84]This one's just a giant circle.
[43:02.20]Okay, this is actually perfect.
[43:03.98]Alright, so I'm going to christen somebody to be the... Alright, who do we want?
[43:11.25]Alright.
[43:12.41]Everyone has to have... Everybody has to be in a lawnmower.
[43:16.35]What's the name of the... What's the name of the bus?
[43:22.24]No, I'm not the bus.
[43:26.21]I'm a lawn mower.
[43:29.23]It's just called school bus.
[43:30.27]Alright.
[43:31.49]Alright, E.T.
[43:32.15]is the school bus.
[43:33.69]E.T.
[43:33.93]is the school bus.
[43:34.59]Everybody else, you gotta switch to lawn mower.
[43:36.84]Oh, we're gonna... That's the case, man.
[43:41.66]E.T., you are the school bus.
[43:45.04]Lawn mower.
[43:45.64]I wanna see lawn mowers.
[43:46.72]No speed demons.
[43:47.54]Wait, this guy might not be from, like, the stream.
[43:50.62]This guy's like an A ranking.
[43:55.69]You better switch to Lawnmower.
[43:58.14]Only ET can be the school bus here.
[44:06.34]Oh, he's got an A rank.
[44:07.33]He's gonna be good.
[44:09.27]Well, somebody needs to win the race.
[44:10.39]Maybe he'll just win the race.
[44:13.55]Yeah, Lawnmower's only one school bus.
[44:16.31]Yeah, that guy's definitely not, like, watching the stream.
[44:17.84]And I'm sorry for, like, ruining your game.
[44:24.44]I apologize for, like, ruining your game.
[44:29.58]No, we're not going to... Sorry, we don't have to kick this guy.
[44:31.34]This guy's going to win the race.
[44:38.01]That guy will just go and win the race.
[44:47.67]Kill?
[44:48.13]No, what?
[44:50.04]Wait, it's starting in one second.
[44:53.46]You were not... What happened?
[44:54.90]What?
[44:57.62]What?
[44:57.94]I... No.
[44:58.92]What the fuck?
[44:59.78]Oh, come on, dude.
[45:00.77]I wasn't ready when the match started.
[45:03.71]I pressed enter.
[45:06.19]I pressed enter.
[45:07.15]I pressed it fucking like... I pressed enter.
[45:10.15]I really did.
[45:11.33]Come on.
[45:12.82]What the fuck was that?
[45:16.10]Oh my fucking god.
[45:21.06]You're too busy worrying about the other people.
[45:23.12]But I actually pressed enter.
[45:28.16]What a dumb fucking thing in the game, by the way.
[45:31.76]Like, if I join a lobby and I don't ready up, just put me in the game.
[45:35.06]Why does it, like, kick you out of the game?
[45:37.96]Because I wasn't ready.
[45:39.40]I guess I'm not ready.
[45:40.86]God damn it.
[45:41.65]What the fuck?
[45:43.99]And once you ready up, you shouldn't be able to take it off.
[45:46.90]Like if you press that button, it's it.
[45:48.96]You're locked in.
[45:49.92]Not like, no, not ready, ready, not ready, not ready.
[45:52.62]I must have pressed it twice somehow.
[45:56.12]Alright, let's just go back.
[45:57.02]Bang erase, four laps.
[46:00.11]We're going in here.
[46:05.43]Literally, you can ready and unready like a hundred times.
[46:09.64]I must have pressed it twice.
[46:17.45]Alright, we're in this U.S.
[46:18.45]New York.
[46:19.99]We're going in this one.
[46:21.94]Host my own game?
[46:22.82]I don't think I can.
[46:24.02]Unless, is it through Steam?
[46:25.58]Or is it, like, my server?
[46:27.56]Like, on myself?
[46:30.56]Same deal.
[46:35.26]I should just spectate it?
[46:39.89]You want me to just spectate?
[46:40.99]Yeah, I'll just spectate it.
[46:41.77]That's actually a good idea.
[46:42.65]Alright, all lawnmowers.
[46:43.55]All lawnmowers.
[46:47.20]Press C. Oh.
[46:53.68]Press C to host.
[46:56.52]I can create my own server.
[46:57.66]Alright.
[46:58.62]Custom game is LAN only.
[47:01.95]No, I can't make a server.
[47:04.67]I have to have a dedicated server to do that.
[47:06.45]I think I already looked that up.
[47:19.88]Look, we're already in here.
[47:20.60]We're gonna do it here first.
[47:24.46]I am 99% sure that I have to have like an actual server to do this.
[47:29.42]What the fuck?
[47:32.50]Oh boy, that's bad.
[47:34.44]Oh, this is bad.
[47:35.08]This is really bad.
[47:35.62]I have to end the stream.
[47:37.50]My ceiling is leaking right now.
[47:39.58]I'm not even kidding.
[47:40.16]I'm not fucking around.
[47:41.80]I'm not even fucking kidding.
[47:45.91]I wish I was fucking kidding right now, guys.
[47:48.03]This is bad.
[47:50.57]Not kidding.
[47:51.21]I gotta go.
[47:53.33]Oh my fucking lord.
[47:57.29]Oh no, this is bad fucking news.
[47:59.21]No!
[47:59.75]I gotta go.
[48:00.83]I'm so sorry guys.
[48:02.65]I gotta go.
[48:07.21]Bye.
[48:08.61]I'll be back if I can fix this.
[48:10.33]See you later.
[48:15.32]Hi guys.
[48:18.78]I'm back.
[48:20.82]Oh, that was fun.
[48:23.47]It still is fun.
[48:24.23]I'm having a great time.
[48:27.29]Achoo!
[48:28.63]Funny joke.
[48:32.27]So that was interesting.
[48:35.49]If you're curious, if you have no idea what's going on.
[48:37.14]Oh, let me wait.
[48:39.12]I'm like so paranoid.
[48:42.72]Is it a webcam?
[48:43.88]Unplugs?
[48:44.40]No.
[48:45.20]Whatever.
[48:45.50]We'll just sit here for a second.
[48:47.12]I'm going to just tweet again.
[48:51.17]We'll start again.
[48:51.97]Be right back.
[49:01.13]Okay.
[49:02.53]So, upstairs, I'll explain kind of how my current house is shaped.
[49:10.43]I have, it's like a, essentially it's three levels.
[49:14.21]I have a basement, I have the mid-level, and I have an upstairs.
[49:16.61]It's a townhouse, right?
[49:19.04]The problem is, all the way upstairs, in the bathroom, upstairs, we're talking two levels up, my toilet had like a... the toilet's not broken.
[49:33.21]But there's like some fucked up situation with the water.
[49:36.55]So I don't know if there's like something going on with a pipe going down.
[49:40.54]But something happened.
[49:41.68]I killed the water.
[49:43.36]I literally walked upstairs and there was maybe like a centimeter, maybe like two centimeters of like water on the ground in the bathroom.
[49:51.61]And the toilet was full of water.
[49:54.76]Like, you know, um... You know, like the cartoon joke where somebody stuffs the toilet or stuffs the sink with a rag and then turns the water on?
[50:03.74]It was like that.
[50:08.33]And that trickled all the way down.
[50:09.41]That went through the ceiling upstairs, all the way through the ceiling of my living room.
[50:13.47]And then from there, down here and started dripping on my face.
[50:17.23]Like, on the desk here.
[50:19.10]Three levels.
[50:20.06]Two levels, whatever.
[50:22.06]uh it has since stopped I killed the water upstairs and I cleaned up everything there was a lot of water across all my bedrooms it was it was a joke it was an absolute fucking joke and of course like right when I talk about this shit about how I'm moving there's like a disaster in my house I don't know what it is I don't know why I I live like I live such a weird fucking life where I consider myself an incredibly lucky unlucky person
[50:48.90]Think about that, right?
[50:49.58]Like, shit just seems to happen to me that's just fucking stupid.
[50:53.10]But on the other hand, I have, like, a really lucky fucking life.
[50:56.17]It's weird.
[50:58.31]I should get a tattoo on my body that is, like, upside down sevens.
[51:03.23]It's still fucking pretty lucky, but holy shit, man, you're also pretty unlucky, too.
[51:06.73]You're, like, an unlucky, lucky person.
[51:12.86]Edgy.
[51:15.77]But I do want to say one thing in particular, very specifically.
[51:19.85]While I was away, some of you guys gave like hundreds of fucking dollars.
[51:27.11]Literally like $500 or $600 came in as I was cleaning and coming back and checking every so often.
[51:35.20]That's un-fucking-believable.
[51:37.82]I say this a lot, and I really wanted to take a step back here and just say that
[51:44.72]I really do appreciate that.
[51:46.08]Like, as much as, like, oh, no, what do I have to have?
[51:49.32]Fuck up the ceiling.
[51:50.00]I gotta chip out the ceiling.
[51:50.94]Maybe replace something.
[51:53.32]Um... Knowing that you guys care that much to be able to help me out there, even if it's not even necessary, you know what I mean?
[52:01.67]Like, that's next fucking level.
[52:03.35]I can't even believe it.
[52:05.69]Um... Thank you so much, guys.
[52:11.65]Uh...
[52:15.71]The words can't even describe how we expect interest.
[52:20.90]Give us comedy.
[52:22.00]I told you I was going to come back.
[52:23.64]I told you I was going to try.
[52:24.48]But that's next level, man.
[52:28.94]It really is.
[52:31.89]I'm coming up and downstairs and I'm seeing that and it's just like, god damn it, man.
[52:38.83]I don't deserve you guys.
[52:40.51]Seriously.
[52:41.51]Some of you...
[52:47.11]All of you, thank you from the bottom of my fucking heart.
[52:49.15]You make it a lot easier.
[52:50.23]Let's just put it that way.
[52:55.23]But, anyways, let's get back to what we were doing.
[52:58.24]I can't do anything about it right now.
[53:00.72]I just have to let it dry.
[53:01.54]The ceiling has to dry.
[53:03.60]I called some people, and it was essentially the same song and dance.
[53:08.84]You need to wait until it's dry, essentially, to find out what happened.
[53:12.37]And the water's off.
[53:13.35]It's not leaking anymore.
[53:14.47]We're good.
[53:16.77]So, it just sucks that that was just starting to get fun there.
[53:20.87]That was actually just starting to become a really fun time.
[53:24.11]And then that happened, so I think we probably lost half of the people that were here.
[53:28.61]More than that, probably.
[53:32.65]But whatever.
[53:33.11]The show must go on, as they say.
[53:38.41]And I'm not using that toilet again until I get it replaced.
[53:42.65]I'm not touching that thing.
[53:43.75]I ain't even gonna pee in there.
[53:46.15]Water's off in that toilet.
[53:47.37]I'm using the other one.
[53:50.61]So, let's move back here.
[53:54.43]We're the best half, though.
[53:57.83]Oh, man.
[53:58.39]Another hundred fucking dollars.
[54:03.92]Thank you.
[54:04.42]Kyra, Toby, thank you.
[54:05.40]I will go over these, actually.
[54:08.62]I'm just a little shaken by my house having water all over it.
[54:12.48]But Kyra Toby, thank you for the $100.
[54:15.30]Just some bits so you can buy flex tape to fix the ceiling.
[54:17.46]Thanks so much, dude.
[54:19.18]Kyra Toby, Cad BTV, thank you so much.
[54:21.88]$100 from you too.
[54:22.76]I know it's not going to help much, but man, that sucks.
[54:25.59]I really hope that the bucks cheer you up.
[54:31.15]Now, that's way more than enough, man.
[54:32.75]Really, like...
[54:35.49]Don't worry about me.
[54:36.07]I'll be just fine.
[54:36.89]Like, I can't even fucking imagine that people would like to give me that amount of money.
[54:42.93]Like, seriously.
[54:43.59]Okay, I gave me $200 fucking dollars here.
[54:47.54]Hope it helps.
[54:47.98]Thank you.
[54:49.56]Laura, I gave $250 fucking dollars.
[54:54.56]Thank you.
[54:56.48]Hope this helps with the repairs, dude.
[54:57.66]That sucks.
[55:00.99]Thank you so much, man.
[55:02.57]Like, for real.
[55:03.99]Do you understand, like, how fucking... How... I can't even explain it.
[55:11.60]You guys are too fucking kind.
[55:14.78]I hope it's worth it.
[55:15.70]Because I just... That's all I can say.
[55:19.16]It's unbelievable.
[55:21.67]Un-fucking-believable to me that this is, like, a reality.
[55:24.85]Thank you.
[55:28.36]Vertiquad, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[55:32.24]Never donated to any streamer before, but after witnessing this along with hearing about the situation, I want to let you know we're here for you and we believe in you.
[55:43.27]Please take care.
[55:43.85]Best wishes, man.
[55:44.47]You've helped me more than I can ever repay.
[55:50.09]Thank you.
[55:52.47]That means a lot.
[55:53.31]But please, also, let me, like, just put this out there really, really quickly before we move on and play the game here.
[55:59.52]Don't, do not, you don't have to give me money.
[56:01.18]Like, you don't, this, the repairs, it's, you don't, don't, like, just think that you have to start dumping money into the stream here.
[56:11.47]As much as I love and appreciate all of that, guys.
[56:14.71]I don't want this to turn into like, oh, like, water leaked through my ceiling.
[56:18.78]Therefore, now, here's $5,000.
[56:21.72]You know, that's not necessary.
[56:25.26]Thank you so much, everybody.
[56:26.98]Take it, take it, take it.
[56:29.02]Don't tell us what to do.
[56:31.97]$50 from Cookie.
[56:33.29]Here's my measly $50.
[56:34.23]It's not measly.
[56:35.65]It's not.
[56:38.13]Oh, my God.
[56:41.23]Just take it.
[56:42.15]Making you feel guilty is part of the entertainment.
[56:52.59]Unbelievable.
[57:03.91]Cookie, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[57:05.03]Eve's, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[57:13.73]I hope you guys realize that when I see shit like this, this is why I want to do the shit that I want to do.
[57:17.99]You know that, right?
[57:28.84]That's a lot of fucking money.
[57:30.34]This is like a monumental amount of money.
[57:40.87]Making the first billionaire?
[57:42.85]No.
[57:48.30]ungrateful no no no no no like it's hard to put into words I can't even fucking believe this this is reiterating the shit we've talked about before the move to Vegas the wanting to make more content do more things reach out spend money on these things like the money that you guys are giving me right now is going right back in
[58:16.18]You allow me to do these fucking things.
[58:18.32]You understand?
[58:24.30]But real quick, thank you, Cookie, for the 50 bucks.
[58:27.28]Here's my measly 50 bucks because I love you and you're wonderful as much as we make fun of you.
[58:33.45]If it wasn't for you, me and my friends back in 2014, we would have had much worse times.
[58:38.71]Thanks so much for everything you've done, Jerma.
[58:39.95]We love you.
[58:42.51]Thank you.
[58:44.66]And then Eve's with the $50 too.
[58:46.02]Also, I just got back at the end of the first stream and despite you not asking for money, I'm going to give you money.
[58:51.76]I love you.
[58:52.74]You're one of the only content creators I follow.
[58:55.51]I will follow to the end of the Earth.
[58:59.81]Thank you for the huge amount of money, guys.
[59:01.57]This is... I'm going to have to stream the repairs.
[59:08.79]Alright.
[59:09.53]We'll get to the other ones after the stream is over.
[59:13.02]But DreamSickle also gave 50 fucking dollars earlier.
[59:17.90]He just says, for you, let's play some Wreckfest.
[59:29.39]Before you guys make me fucking cry.
[59:34.30]Same deal we're going to do last time.
[59:35.44]We're going to just get into a game.
[59:44.62]We're going to get into a banger race.
[59:47.64]This one's two laps.
[59:50.28]Is there one that's three cars?
[59:54.34]Twelve laps.
[59:55.16]Let's do the one that's two laps, right?
[59:56.86]Dirty racing.
[59:58.20]Oh, wait.
[59:58.40]This is like somebody's stream.
[60:01.04]Is that somebody's live stream?
[60:04.56]Okay.
[60:04.78]Let's just go into... This one's fine.
[60:06.30]Six laps.
[60:06.82]Not like it's going to matter.
[60:08.94]Oh, all the sounds.
[60:09.88]Okay.
[60:10.14]Yeah.
[60:10.84]Sorry about that.
[60:12.57]Alright, let's go into this one.
[60:14.73]I guess no rules.
[60:17.87]C, wait, C, C, C, C, C, C. Okay, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[60:21.64]C. Do I need anything?
[60:24.94]Oh, whoops.
[60:28.26]Last man standing.
[60:28.90]Okay, so I can just... Do I need to do anything else?
[60:34.81]Or is it just select all these things?
[60:36.35]Do I need to have like a port forwarding or something?
[60:39.45]Server name.
[60:43.06]$50 again coming in from Brobo Turbo.
[60:48.06]Thank you, dude.
[60:48.56]Never donated before.
[60:49.42]Figured I'm long overdue for all the hours of free entertainment.
[60:52.95]Don't ever feel overdue.
[60:55.67]I really appreciate that, though, dude.
[60:56.83]Thank you so much.
[60:57.45]$0 or $1,000.
[61:01.39]Thank you for being here in the first place.
[61:04.81]Alright.
[61:05.33]I guess the name of the server is going to be
[61:10.74]Uh, moto.
[61:12.06]Motobikes.
[61:15.20]Alright, password... Recommended upstream.
[61:20.25]But, uh, is this gonna even work?
[61:24.27]This ain't gonna, this ain't gonna, like, leak my IP, is it?
[61:28.17]That's not gonna be an issue, is it?
[61:31.76]That's something I'm actually kind of concerned about right now, no.
[61:37.54]Because, like, that would be bad.

[62:56.90]We are gonna go to... Is this a baseball field?
[63:00.46]No, alright.
[63:00.98]We need to do one where we can run away from the bus.
[63:05.48]Needs to be like kind of a town.
[63:08.01]This is kind of a town.
[63:10.15]Filling road course...
[63:12.82]Oh, this one.
[63:14.18]High-speed road course in beautiful Nordic setting that's technically not too demanding and offers plenty of opportunities for overtaking.
[63:22.47]And we'll go to the main circuit course.
[63:26.13]Alright.
[63:27.33]Looks good, right?

[63:51.71]How's the leaky ceiling?
[63:52.51]Not leaking anymore, but still an issue.
[63:59.19]Okay, here we are.
[64:03.85]I am not ready.
[64:04.67]Let's see if anybody's going to come in here.
[64:16.61]A Jerma was wondering when you were going to apply to be contested on Destroy Bill Destroy.
[64:21.75]I don't know what that is.
[64:24.11]What is Destroy Bill Destroy?
[64:25.25]Are the subs from earlier going to show up in the credits?
[64:28.60]No, they're not.
[64:29.64]Unfortunately.
[64:30.56]That's not cool.
[64:35.60]Nobody's going to join me.
[64:41.62]Ready up.
[64:42.98]Well, I can't ready up until there's a player in here.
[64:50.07]It's turkey2 is the password.

[65:20.28]Oh, no.
[65:20.74]I thought... Hold on.
[65:21.54]Right click?
[65:22.58]I thought that was somebody's name.
[65:23.82]I thought the name was right click.
[65:28.03]I can't find the server.
[65:31.25]Uh... Not on the server list.
[65:38.51]Well... Right click.
[65:41.90]Joined your server.
[65:43.28]Cookie, thank you for $50 again.
[65:44.22]Again.
[65:46.58]Thank you for the 50 fucking dollars.
[65:48.46]More than- You've given fucking a ton of money, man.
[65:50.90]Do you remember the lesson is break your fucking toilets for free money.
[65:54.78]No, that's- Alright, I gotta go back.
[65:56.76]Forward your IP.
[65:58.98]Thank you so much, Cookie.
[66:00.42]Honest to God.
[66:00.96]Uh... Okay, we're gonna have to go in a different server.
[66:10.19]This is not working.
[66:11.21]I have to start the server first.
[66:14.97]What do you mean start the server first?
[66:18.08]I already did.
[66:19.80]God damn it.
[66:21.68]No, this is just me in here.
[66:25.77]I don't have to start the server.
[66:27.13]There is no server to start.
[66:28.77]Let's just fucking crash into these people.
[66:31.57]I'll start the server.
[66:35.03]No, you can't.
[66:40.89]I can't, like, take this down?
[66:45.83]There's nobody here!
[66:47.07]Alright, we gotta pick a server.
[66:48.83]We're just gonna do what we did last time.
[66:54.85]You probably need to port forward.
[66:59.80]No, we're just gonna go into this.
[67:03.74]We need an elimination race.
[67:05.10]This is ten laps.
[67:09.42]We need a last man standing banger race.
[67:12.00]Two laps.
[67:16.18]else is there banger race no rules no rules here it is this one's fine box four no rules so remember when you come into this one
[67:36.16]Everybody has to be a lawnmower, except for one guy in a school bus, I will deem who that person is.
[67:41.43]And by the way, make sure you check out these guys, twitch.tv/phantomfox4 and jkx.
[67:46.59]Check out those guys on their Twitch stream.
[67:52.16]Alright, so, change your car.
[67:54.86]Everybody has to be a lawnmower.
[68:02.13]No fucking rules.
[68:04.51]Alright, so we got lawnmower, lawnmower.
[68:05.65]Everyone's gonna be a lawnmower.
[68:06.77]And I will tell you right now, the one person that's going to be... The one person that's gonna be a non-lawnmower... Didn't you already do this two hours ago?
[68:17.86]Uh, no.
[68:18.42]What happened was... See, I'm not sure if you... We might have been inside of this lobby...
[68:24.45]And you may have, like, just kind of clicked off the stream.
[68:26.94]What happened was my ceiling started to have water drop down onto my head.
[68:31.44]We were in this exact menu.
[68:34.78]My whole house has been destroyed by water damage.
[68:37.96]That's pretty much what happened since you left there.
[68:45.73]Don't fucking scare me here.
[68:47.33]Happening again.
[68:48.03]No, it's not.
[68:48.65]Lawnmower, lawnmower.

[69:01.18]Why not?
[69:07.37]Lawnmower.
[69:08.05]And, by the way, I also want to tell Ratboy is going to be the school bus.
[69:16.62]Ratboy, please change to the school bus.
[69:20.28]I can't use this server.
[69:21.50]Why not?
[69:23.50]What's wrong?
[69:25.18]These bots need to get out of here.
[69:26.26]Can we kick the bots?
[69:31.50]The biblical floods.
[69:33.34]We can't use car restrictions?
[69:34.94]I thought there were no rules!
[69:37.19]This says special vehicles enabled, doesn't it?
[69:38.95]Well, you can't have a server that says no rules!
[69:54.36]No rules yet, cars, but... Oh, well... Alright, okay, well, let's go somewhere else.
[70:07.55]Car restriction.
[70:08.59]Go back to fucking... Damn it.
[70:13.52]Okay, well, no rules except that one.
[70:19.46]Yeah, we got Banger Race.

[70:42.02]Event type car restrict.
[70:43.11]Max Class B. Is this one alright?
[70:49.28]Are there any car restrictions on this one?
[70:58.63]Because I'm in Max Class B. I'm not sure what that means.
[71:04.81]Sorry for the wonky start here, guys.

[71:23.06]Those of you that just tuned back in.
[71:24.98]The leak is not leaking anymore, but I have a lot of random damage upstairs.
[71:30.36]It's like just still going.
[71:31.54]No, it's not.
[71:31.94]I'm kidding.
[71:34.98]Pop this chat out.
[71:40.67]What if I just turn the stream back on and like this water's still leaking downstairs?
[71:45.39]Alright, got the lawnmower selected.
[71:47.49]So, uh, again, where is Ratboy?
[71:49.90]Ratboy, the school bus, everybody else, please change to the lawnmower.
[71:56.80]I'm ready, right?
[71:57.90]We're gonna end up with, like, a... Okay, we got... There's, like, still two or three dumb bots in here.
[72:06.79]If you gave warning, I could have a server set up ready.
[72:10.77]Uh...
[72:14.44]Can you?
[72:15.14]Well, I think we're alright.
[72:19.28]Thought the stream was over?
[72:20.18]It was.
[72:20.92]And I came back.
[72:24.40]I'm readied up, though.
[72:26.40]Like, even if there's a couple of, like, dumb asshole bots in here, it's fine.
[72:31.24]We got our one school bus.
[72:34.88]4,000 ping.
[72:38.61]People are joining still, so it's gonna be fine.
[72:43.67]Uh, Todd, you need to get a lawn mower.

[72:54.11]We're good.
[72:54.41]This is enough.
[72:55.05]This is enough.
[72:55.66]Forget about the dumb bots.
[72:57.18]Alright, I'm ready.
[72:57.82]Ready?
[72:58.94]Avoid the school bus.
[72:59.84]That's the whole point of the game.
[73:02.44]Where are the sheep getting away from the one wolf?
[73:08.06]Oh my- No!
[73:11.64]Oh god.
[73:16.11]I'm gonna get hit by the random other gazelles.
[73:20.55]Jesus.
[73:20.95]I'm already dead.
[73:29.11]I got fucking killed, not by the school bus, but by the... God damn it.
[73:38.63]Where's the school bus?
[73:39.47]There it is.

[75:28.47]Where are we?
[75:36.46]Gork, you are really doing a good job here.
[75:39.16]I got hit from behind for a second and the guy flew off.
[75:46.00]Alright, the bus has changed, just pray.
[75:51.60]I love how these two stupid fucking bots are just still in here.
[76:09.97]That looks like it's coming across the screen.
[76:13.31]Ugh, I'm having a tough time.
[76:19.97]You gonna catch anybody else?
[76:22.21]Come on, Vol.
[76:24.69]Can I take control of a bot?
[76:25.85]I don't think so.
[76:26.53]Alright, he got... Did he... Yeah, he got that guy.
[76:31.31]He ate that person.
[76:34.27]Do we need two buses?
[76:35.21]I got a better idea.
[76:35.83]How about everyone's a bus except for me?
[76:42.66]Gork.
[76:43.66]Gork has been doing a great job here.
[76:52.82]Hold on, where did that other car go?
[76:54.31]Where did the red car just go?
[76:57.55]Watch out, he's on your tail.
[76:59.31]He's right behind you.
[77:01.45]Make a move.
[77:02.07]Nice move.
[77:04.69]Good idea.
[77:06.91]Nice work, man.
[77:11.53]Now that's just taunting.
[77:21.26]No, not quite.
[77:25.49]Alright, that guy's fine.
[77:29.63]I mean, who's even left?
[77:35.36]Alright, let's just keep the perspective here.
[77:41.80]I like this perspective.
[77:45.48]I'm going to free cam.
[77:50.93]We're on like lens effects.
[78:07.01]Free cam.
[78:07.95]Here we go.
[78:12.27]Whoops.
[78:21.01]Oh my god, I'm gonna make everybody sick.
[78:36.43]No, go back to the... God damn it!
[78:41.09]No, where's the lens effect?
[78:50.78]Okay, that's good.
[78:51.32]Where's the bus?
[78:59.98]Looking for bus.
[79:00.63]Where are you?
[79:02.15]There you are.
[79:05.73]Dude, if I was the boss, I would just turn around.
[79:07.35]I would just spin around.
[79:10.75]He's almost exploded, too.
[79:11.69]Look at how much health he has.
[79:12.54]I love how he's listening to that.
[79:15.54]He's like, oh yeah, that's a pretty good idea.
[79:17.56]Thanks for the tip, dude.
[79:33.03]Well, that's it.
[79:36.38]I'm just waiting for another person to come around the corner here.
[79:41.00]Here come the last two ants.
[79:44.94]He made it.
[79:47.11]He killed the bus.
[79:48.19]Well, that was a decent tip.
[79:49.31]You don't think so?
[79:49.89]I love how these people... You guys are still racing?
[80:03.21]Isn't it over?
[80:06.13]It's not over.
[80:09.85]Why is it not over yet?
[80:16.26]I thought he... Oh, no, that's right.
[80:20.46]I completely forgot.
[80:22.72]The game doesn't know we're playing that game.
[80:28.61]Okay, there we go.
[80:29.37]Back to lobby.
[80:33.35]10 laps.
[80:34.69]Alright, so here's the deal.
[80:35.67]I'm staying lawnmower.
[80:36.56]Everybody else has to be a school bus.
[80:40.26]And you can't... Remember, here's the goal.
[80:43.18]When I... Everyone is a school bus except for me.
[80:46.48]No one is allowed to pass me.
[80:49.53]If you pass me, then you get electrocuted.
[80:54.51]So you have to just follow me and try... Follow me and no passing me.
[81:07.30]No, I actually, no, I got a better idea.
[81:08.72]So, nobody gets to leave yet.
[81:11.75]So, when I'm, hold on, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[81:15.41]Everybody get a school bus.
[81:16.61]I'm going to be a lawnmower.
[81:18.39]And I get like a 10 second head start.
[81:24.93]I want to see some more school buses here.
[81:30.35]No, yeah, right when the clock starts, I go.
[81:33.11]After 10 seconds, you guys go.
[81:37.57]Ten seconds, you'll get two feet away from them.
[81:39.58]No, we'll be fine.
[81:42.20]Alright, we see plenty of school buses here.
[81:43.66]I'm ready up.
[81:44.60]Ready up.
[81:47.28]Sixty seconds.
[81:47.90]Make sure you are a... Gork, make sure you are a school bus.
[81:51.90]Thank you.
[81:52.82]Mr. Fox, make sure you are a school bus.
[81:56.00]That's not a school bus.
[81:57.22]That's a harvester.
[82:00.62]Anybody else in here that's about to get in big trouble?
[82:04.35]Not a school bus.
[82:07.09]Thank you.
[82:08.31]Not a school bus.
[82:11.90]Thank you.
[82:14.68]Alright, we're good.
[82:15.94]Let's start.
[82:18.70]Ready up.
[82:20.40]So remember, when the clock gets zero, don't leave.
[82:23.47]I get a 10 second head start.
[82:35.36]No, this is great.
[82:36.10]There's a lot of school buses.
[82:37.06]I get a 10 second head start.
[82:39.21]Nobody move.
[82:40.19]Nobody move.
[82:41.23]You understand?
[82:41.85]I don't want to see any movement.
[82:43.37]Nobody move.
[82:44.51]Let me get in front first.
[82:46.93]Don't move.
[82:47.41]Don't move.
[82:47.99]Don't move.
[82:49.69]Hey, easy.
[82:53.06]Don't you dare.
[82:54.22]Okay, you ruined it.
[82:55.58]You ruined it.
[82:56.12]Congratulations.
[83:14.24]What happened to you?
[83:25.67]No, no, no.
[83:38.71]No.
[83:39.13]You fucked it up again.
[83:41.37]You fucked it all up.
[83:44.59]Bastard!
[83:46.55]Alright, how do I turn off the game?
[83:47.87]Like, how do I, like, make it so we have to... We're not doing ten laps here.
[83:54.79]God, fucking one guy just, like... Alright, just do me a favor, everybody.
[83:59.56]Crash into each other.
[84:02.18]Crash.
[84:03.04]Just ruin everything.
[84:04.12]Smash into everything.
[84:07.96]Just... Everyone just blow yourselves up.
[84:21.14]Cause as much damage as you... Good.
[84:23.91]I want to see explosions.
[84:24.81]I want to see everybody... I want to see everybody die here.
[84:29.07]We're doing this again.
[84:30.03]And we got to get it right.
[84:33.39]This has to be done correctly.
[84:37.97]This is why I should have hosted.
[84:38.99]Well, I tried to host and it didn't work.
[84:41.57]We couldn't get it to work.
[84:42.41]There we go.
[84:49.56]How did you miss everything?
[84:50.92]That's almost impossible.
[84:52.70]It's like there's no way you can avoid this.
[85:04.89]I would just put myself perpendicular.
[85:10.41]One touch and he's dead.
[85:11.13]Yeah, you go like that.
[85:12.09]You get it.
[85:13.09]Perpendicular.
[85:14.01]Make it impossible.
[85:14.81]Make a roadblock.
[85:20.54]He still got through.
[85:24.52]Okay.
[85:28.50]He's still alive.
[85:29.54]He's not dead yet.
[85:31.64]He is just barely still alive.
[85:35.36]Nice work, man.
[85:36.62]At least he's still alive.
[85:41.37]There it is.
[85:42.13]See you later.
[85:42.89]And that killed him, and that's gonna kill him.
[85:44.35]Alright, who's left?
[85:45.03]Mr. Fox?
[85:51.91]He's in agony.
[85:52.93]Put him out.
[85:57.49]Who else is in control of these buses?
[86:03.39]That's it, right?
[86:04.02]Yeah, alright.
[86:04.76]Good, good, good.
[86:06.16]If you're still alive, make sure you just drive into a wall.
[86:08.24]Alright, you win.
[86:10.28]Alex, congratulations.
[86:11.30]You won.
[86:14.94]Wait, does that... Can he just finish the race if he really wanted to?
[86:23.02]I guess he could just do it.
[86:30.55]No, you gotta drive, drive into some walls.
[86:34.05]You gotta take that HP down.
[86:35.50]You gotta crash.
[86:56.91]Ugh, he's smokin'.
[87:01.25]Almost, one more.
[87:06.04]Oh, goddammit, come on.
[87:09.44]Last bit.
[87:09.90]Hey, you won the game, though.
[87:11.12]Congratulations.
[87:11.72]Alright, let's go back to lobby.
[87:12.94]Do it again.
[87:13.52]Nobody change.
[87:14.68]This time, depending on where I'm standing, I got a better idea.
[87:17.92]Alright, nobody change.
[87:20.96]Everybody just ready up.
[87:28.36]Just make sure your school bus is ready up.
[87:31.96]You just don't... You can't move.
[87:38.00]We're gonna get this right.
[87:40.59]Alright.
[87:41.07]R up.
[87:44.81]Depending on where I'm seated... If I'm in, like, the back of the area, I'm gonna turn around and go the other way.
[87:50.93]If I'm in the front, I'm just gonna drive.
[87:52.45]Nobody else move.
[87:54.34]If somebody does like the L-U-L funny moment where they smash into me as I'm trying to weave my way through, I will delete my Twitch channel.
[88:02.21]No, don't say that.
[88:02.69]That means somebody's gonna do it as a joke, and like, oh, well, she has to delete his Twitch channel.
[88:07.99]Alright, we're good.
[88:10.33]No, no, no.
[88:10.65]I will delete your Twitch channel.
[88:12.94]How does that sound?
[88:14.64]Right?
[88:14.96]Like, if that happens, I know who you are, and I'll correlate... I got all the data, right?
[88:18.50]I'll correlate you into the chat room.
[88:20.20]And I will delete your Twitch channel.
[88:24.27]Alright, ready up.
[88:26.17]Let's do it.
[88:27.93]Just a baby.
[88:28.43]You gotta press that A button before you're gonna get kicked out.
[88:31.11]This happened to me.
[88:32.17]You gotta press A before you get kicked out.
[88:33.48]I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.
[88:35.40]Press A. Alright, I'm right in the front.
[88:38.00]Nobody move.
[88:39.88]One person moves, I delete your Twitch channel.
[88:41.68]Don't move.
[88:43.54]Alright, we don't even have time to react.
[88:45.06]Stay there.
[88:45.42]Don't move.
[88:49.29]Hey, hey!
[88:50.65]Hey, you!
[88:51.47]Alright, new...
[88:54.27]I said don't move!
[88:58.95]No, fucking come on, no!
[89:08.66]And you still can't even beat me.
[89:10.46]And you still can't even beat me.
[89:13.90]And you still can't even beat me!
[89:16.90]I'm unstoppable.
[89:19.56]You know, many have tried, but they've all failed.
[89:24.90]No, no, no, no, no.
[89:31.88]Look at this guy freaking out.
[89:42.57]They're just all fucking animals.
[89:45.79]They're all animals.
[89:49.85]Thank God I have a barrier now.
[89:51.05]I'm blocked in.
[90:11.63]Congratulations.
[90:12.91]The guy in the yellow school bus, you're getting deleted.
[90:19.83]Who was in the yellow school bus?
[90:21.21]They fucked the whole thing up.
[90:34.18]Now it doesn't even fucking matter anymore.
[90:36.36]None of this even matters.
[90:38.04]That person looks like a loaf of bread.
[90:44.07]Hold on, I want to follow the loaf of bread.
[90:45.97]Where's the loaf of bread?
[90:47.57]Where is he?
[90:48.47]There he is.
[90:51.79]He looks so innocent.
[90:54.12]No, give me the loaf of bread.
[90:55.06]That's all I care about right now.
[90:57.02]This guy.
[90:57.48]You're deleted.
[91:00.48]Where are you?
[91:01.04]Please still be alive.
[91:02.10]Is that him?
[91:11.26]I don't know where he is.
[91:19.21]Where's the loaf?
[91:22.13]I think he might have exploded.
[91:26.82]There he is.
[91:27.16]There he is.
[91:27.48]He's still alive.
[91:28.32]No, that's not the loaf of bread.
[91:29.38]Fuck.
[91:31.04]Neither is that.
[91:31.62]No, I don't care about anybody else.
[91:38.03]No, he's gone.
[91:43.75]That's so sad.
[91:51.53]Is that the loaf of bread?
[91:52.53]No.
[91:55.81]He's there.
[91:56.45]Where is he?
[91:59.21]There he is.
[92:00.13]I think that's him.
[92:01.17]I think that's the loaf of bread.
[92:03.01]I feel like it was a little more extreme.
[92:14.49]Alright.
[92:16.11]Let's just do a different game mode.
[92:21.30]Yeah, he's going to be gone in a second.
[92:24.00]Oh, there's the loaf of bread.
[92:25.04]But he got, like, squished in even more.
[92:31.33]Alright.
[92:33.61]The last thing we're going to do is we're going to do all harvesters.
[92:35.81]I have mods to turn on, too.
[92:36.99]I couldn't get the server to work.
[92:48.90]All harvesters?
[92:59.88]Do the demolition derp?
[93:00.60]Yeah, we will.
[93:05.02]School bus.
[93:05.56]That's the guy.
[93:07.18]Deleted.
[93:09.90]This is still racing.
[93:17.40]Alright.
[93:18.10]I'm backing out.
[93:20.44]I'm backing out.
[93:21.40]We're quitting the multiplayer.
[93:22.24]We're going to a different server.
[93:28.69]Multiplayer.
[93:30.88]This one is Deathmatch in Madman Stadium.
[93:35.79]Let's try that one.
[93:42.23]Would I recommend this game?
[93:43.35]If you like destroying cars, then yeah.
[93:47.39]This is Deathmatch in Madman Stadium.
[93:50.68]We have some more big money coming in.
[93:54.02]Oh man, we did.
[93:55.20]Snormychoo right now.
[93:56.06]Thanks for the $50, Snormychoo.
[93:59.08]Had some good laughs, but sadly can't stick around.
[94:00.82]Heard about your house issues, and I hope it gets resolved.
[94:03.14]Good night to you and everybody in chat.
[94:06.18]Thanks for hanging out, Stormy Choo.
[94:07.33]Thank you for the monumental donation.
[94:11.89]Wait, what's going on?
[94:12.45]Why can't I connect?
[94:13.25]I think I broke the server.
[94:16.29]Thank you so much, man.
[94:17.87]Have a good rest of your night.
[94:21.58]I can't believe it rained in my house.
[94:22.84]Neither can I. Something's going on here, though.
[94:27.54]Yeah and I'm kind of- the reason why I would not have come back if I actually didn't need to take my mind off it-
[94:33.00]Because I was just sitting there in my living room upstairs just like with my hands in my fucking face.
[94:38.00]Just like this is a- this is a joke.
[94:40.00]So I had to come back down after everything was cleaned up and just take my mind off it.
[94:43.00]It's just- I have to deal with it tomorrow.
[94:47.00]So let's just get this- let me just talk about this now.
[94:50.00]Um... I- there was going to be this big thing where we did the emote contest thing tomorrow.
[94:58.50]I may have to move that after this.
[95:00.50]I might not, but if it does happen to move, I'll let you know for sure on Twitter.
[95:04.71]But what's going on with this game?
[95:11.79]I think I'm locked out here.
[95:15.43]I'll restart the game.
[95:18.81]Let's restart it.
[95:22.88]End Wreckfest.
[95:26.08]Well, that was weird.
[95:27.92]Bring it back.
[95:28.40]Get it on Steam.
[95:40.25]Maybe I just kind of got locked out because we were all jumping in there at the same time, maybe?
[95:45.05]Something like that.
[95:48.18]That's okay.
[95:49.46]Yeah, it just sucks because the streams are going to get really erratic and I don't want to just do the thing where it's
[95:56.91]Oh, yeah.
[95:57.63]I'll see you an hour by.
[95:59.43]I can't stream.
[96:01.26]I don't want to just not stream.
[96:03.66]Because, obviously, it's something I'd like to do.
[96:10.12]Alright.
[96:12.49]This is where we were before.
[96:13.73]Last Man Standing.
[96:14.75]This is another banger race.
[96:17.39]What about this one?
[96:18.11]Last Man Standing again.
[96:19.13]Let's do Last Man Standing.
[96:24.46]In the mud pit.
[96:27.59]Either... Yeah, the last man standing over here.
[96:29.96]This is Big Valley Speedway.
[96:32.44]Let's go to the mud pit.
[96:36.04]Add some filters?
[96:36.82]Okay, let's see.
[96:39.02]Status.
[96:42.66]Max D class cars, right?
[96:44.30]I guess we could do last man standing deathmatch team deathmatch.
[96:50.16]Server's not full.
[96:51.02]And the server is open.
[96:53.68]Right?
[96:55.15]That makes some sense.
[96:57.81]I'm not going to find anything with those.
[96:59.07]Lawnmower versus lawnmower.
[97:03.20]In Madman Stadium.
[97:06.02]I guess this is what we got.
[97:13.47]Where is this?
[97:14.13]This is servers in Australia.
[97:17.15]Let's do it.
[97:17.45]I'm just doing this once.
[97:31.65]That's my ping.
[97:32.97]250.
[97:35.69]No swearing.
[97:36.25]I'm not going to swear for the rest of the time we're on this map.
[97:40.39]So how is this going to work?
[97:41.07]It's only lawnmower.
[97:46.86]Alright, well... Select car doesn't matter.
[97:49.54]It's only lawnmower.
[97:55.00]No point in doing deathmatch with... Yeah, I mean, we're just doing this for fun.
[98:01.18]I think we're good.
[98:02.20]Just ready up.
[98:07.96]This filled up quick.
[98:11.80]Alright.
[98:12.86]Hit that ready button.
[98:15.16]What about the double decker?
[98:16.06]Yeah, we will.
[98:20.39]We'll try all the cards.
[98:21.17]60 seconds.
[98:23.51]Come on.
[98:27.41]There are swears in the name.
[98:30.13]How do you unlock the class in Lawnmowers?
[98:32.86]I don't think... I think you just do.
[98:34.28]I think it's just there in some of the servers.
[98:37.82]This actually is... This might be really, really funny.
[98:42.55]Is there one... Who's the person that has the player advantage here?
[98:45.05]Who's like from Australia that's watching?
[98:47.67]None of these people.
[98:50.07]Except... I don't know.
[98:50.83]You're the closest.
[98:52.08]Cody, you seem... Or... Nikki...
[98:57.91]Nikki is closest.
[98:59.45]I think you have host ping advantage here.
[99:06.79]You are very far away.
[99:08.09]I don't even have 300 ping.
[99:14.13]You have west coast though.
[99:16.27]I guess that's true.
[99:19.19]Here we go.
[99:24.13]I come from a land out under.
[99:25.53]Are we going?
[99:36.14]I was waiting.
[99:36.68]Look at this.
[99:37.10]People just floating around.
[99:38.26]Wait, you can go up the bath pipe?
[99:43.22]What?
[99:43.64]What?
[99:45.06]What happened?
[99:48.07]Oh, wait.
[99:48.49]You get to respawn.
[99:57.91]I had an ejector seat.
[100:05.55]Look at that guy flying around.
[100:08.43]300 ping.
[100:10.67]I don't understand, how many people did you kill?
[100:19.62]You just respawned.
[100:20.88]This is ten minutes of this?
[100:23.66]I don't want to do this for ten more seconds.
[100:26.50]Let alone ten more minutes.
[100:30.76]Alright, what if I just don't move?
[100:38.66]I want to get a good view.
[100:42.16]This sucks.
[100:50.32]This sucks.
[100:54.15]I'm still fine.
[100:57.71]Get up!
[100:58.67]Oh my god, really?
[100:59.69]Alright, well that was fun.
[101:08.19]Let's get out of here.
[101:10.81]This is an interesting, interesting fun game.
[101:30.73]What happened to that guy?
[101:32.89]Why are these people all flying off?
[101:37.02]They didn't do anything.
[101:40.82]Ugh.
[101:43.06]That person.
[101:44.08]Oh, someone just bumped into me.
[101:45.28]Some phantom lag just bumped into me.
[101:47.38]Alright, what next time I fall, I'll probably do.
[101:51.80]I'm going to make it real easy for them.
[102:03.15]Alright, goodbye.
[102:05.77]Let's go back.
[102:06.33]Alright, we need to change the rules.
[102:12.03]If my filter is... Take that off.
[102:14.69]Here we go.
[102:15.21]Okay.
[102:17.81]Alright, we got Madman Stadium.
[102:19.89]This is Deathmatch.
[102:20.75]Last Man Standing.
[102:21.51]Deathmatch.
[102:23.64]This is Crash Test Dummy Derby.
[102:27.70]What's this one?
[102:29.95]In Fairfield County.
[102:42.38]Crash test dummy.
[102:48.32]So, no car restriction.
[102:51.03]Sunset.
[102:52.49]Is this just a regular derby?
[102:56.61]Fuck, this is ten minutes.
[103:00.42]God damn it.
[103:02.55]Alright, well, let's make this quick then.
[103:05.79]One boss versus 20 lawnmowers?
[103:09.53]Special vehicles are just... Back out.
[103:13.23]Back out.
[103:13.61]Just back out.
[103:20.92]We could just do a normal race.
[103:22.10]You're right.
[103:23.22]I do want to do like a team situation here though.
[103:25.58]A team deathmatch.
[103:28.06]No rules, all maps.
[103:29.52]This is in Germany.
[103:34.00]Mud pit.
[103:37.06]Deathmatch.
[103:38.77]Maybe we can go up a little higher here.
[103:41.55]This is Last Man Standing.
[103:42.65]This is on a big valley speedway.
[103:47.79]Really, these are the only few here that could be done.
[103:50.65]Last Man Standing again.
[103:51.57]This one's three minutes.
[103:52.68]Deathmatch, three minutes.
[103:59.28]Let's do this one here.
[104:00.40]This is just Madman Stadium Deathmatch.
[104:05.84]Just see how it is.
[104:15.18]Special vehicles are enabled, no car restrictions.
[104:17.06]Alright.
[104:18.20]So let's take a look at the special cards over here.
[104:22.96]We got the Harvester, the Double Decker, School Buses.
[104:27.97]Let's do Harvesters.
[104:31.43]So what the fuck?
[104:32.03]This is just actually a... A meat grinder?
[104:37.59]Got a host advantage?
[104:38.41]Yeah, that's alright.
[104:42.47]I guess you pick between harvester, lawnmower... Or... Yeah, harvester or lawnmower.
[104:49.45]That would ask me why you would pick lawnmower.
[104:53.05]There's actually no reason why, considering you'll lose every time.
[105:03.40]Looks like everyone wants to do the harvester.
[105:06.22]One guy here.
[105:06.80]Gork wants to be a lawnmower.
[105:09.14]You guys are going to get torn to shreds.
[105:16.09]One guy.
[105:17.15]No, it's two.
[105:17.83]It's like four people now.
[105:19.03]Alright.
[105:26.35]Ready up.
[105:26.99]Let's do it.
[105:29.91]15 second car reset.
[105:30.93]Deathmatch.
[105:32.78]20 minutes.
[105:34.04]I thought this was 3 minutes.
[105:39.16]After this, we're gonna just do an actual race.
[105:45.03]This thing said 3 minutes.
[105:50.97]Make sure you press the R button.
[105:53.59]Todd, ready up.
[105:55.43]Kodos, ready up.
[105:59.30]Hit the A button.
[106:00.06]Hit the A button.
[106:01.44]Or enter whichever one you have.
[106:03.22]There we go.
[106:03.84]Alright.
[106:04.44]Trash.
[106:08.73]Do we have to turn on the device?
[106:11.51]How does it work?
[106:17.57]Is there a way I can spin the wheel here?
[106:32.00]Okay.
[106:32.96]Is that better?
[106:36.20]That should be better.
[106:41.29]Speed is too high.
[106:44.59]Can we see if he can be broken?
[106:46.59]Can we see if he can be destroyed?
[106:53.42]Zero take that.
[106:59.61]This is a lot lamer than I thought.
[107:03.28]We're all just lobsters in a tank.
[107:08.30]Because this is just inside of the grocery store lobster cake.
[107:10.46]That's exactly what you see.
[107:17.77]They do this too, they're like, I rolled over and you walk on me.
[107:21.55]I rolled over and now I'm gonna walk on this guy.
[107:36.79]And by the way, 20 fucking minutes.
[107:41.85]20 minutes!
[107:43.35]This is free.
[107:46.20]It's still so loud.
[107:49.64]Don't you know there's a video game in 2018?
[107:52.72]It's louder than everything you've ever heard in your life.
[108:00.47]What is this doing?
[108:01.97]Free kills?
[108:02.53]I'll take them.
[108:08.60]That even counts as a takedown?
[108:14.98]This still is going to get loud.
[108:16.08]Alright, well I don't want to do this for 20 more minutes.
[108:28.99]Alright.
[108:30.03]Who's going to get picked to be putting the pot here?
[108:32.35]O-W-O.
[108:35.23]Why is he doing that?

[111:23.14]Rainbow Road N64 Music.
[111:28.44]This is kind of asking for a Nintendo DMCA.
[111:30.44]What have we got here?
[111:35.18]I think this is an ad.
[111:39.84]Yes, it is.
[111:42.57]You can already hear it in your head.
[111:45.66]Let's see.
[111:46.00]How does this go?
[111:47.94]Yeah, now I remember.
[111:57.45]Oh, wow.
[111:58.03]I remember now.
[111:58.53]Alright.
[112:01.45]Let's start it over.
[112:02.85]I'm not sure I even can.
[112:03.93]Okay.
[112:06.12]I'm not going to get banned.
[112:07.23]Don't worry.
[112:08.75]Let's start it.
[112:09.57]Select.
[112:10.71]And select track.
[112:11.65]We already got that selected.
[112:12.71]Remastered.
[112:13.49]And let's go.
[112:16.47]Summary.
[112:17.00]That sounds good.
[112:17.90]There are 20 how many people here?
[112:21.96]Grid size.
[112:22.66]Damage normal.
[112:24.80]Custom, custom, custom.
[112:27.87]Let's go.

[112:48.11]Wait.
[112:54.96]Here we go!
[113:00.76]Yes, I can Mario Kart!
[113:02.10]There's 24 other players!
[113:18.06]I thought about the low gravity.
[113:23.71]Just like in Mario Kart.
[113:25.75]I gotta do the skip.
[113:26.93]I can't do the skip like this.
[113:32.25]I remember that part.
[113:36.61]Alright, there's still 24 people.
[113:42.75]What?
[113:42.91]I thought there was no sides in Rainbow Road.
[113:49.49]Why do I have, like, the kids bowling bumpers?
[113:54.59]Everyone's flying off the edge.
[113:55.85]Why?
[113:56.39]Oh, wait!
[113:56.91]That's why!
[113:57.37]I always thought there were no sides.
[114:06.31]Oh, that's the remastered one.
[114:09.21]Well, how am I supposed to know?
[114:16.13]I can get to first place.
[114:21.76]Wouldn't be better with power-ups.
[114:22.91]I agree.
[114:23.41]Although I could... I actually might be able to get higher here.
[114:35.15]Really is so good.
[114:35.83]It does the old music back in the day.
[114:38.92]So classic.
[114:42.38]Get out of my way.
[114:45.74]If I get in between... If I get 10th place or higher, I win.
[114:51.68]What's going on?
[114:53.70]What the fuck is going on?
[114:56.84]What?
[114:57.34]What?
[115:05.96]I'm, like, spectating.
[115:14.99]Press 1 to hide.
[115:19.49]Well, that was fun.
[115:22.10]Oh, I got wrecked.
[115:28.84]Okay, well that was fun.
[115:34.05]I opened up the console somehow.
[115:36.67]Alright, what was the other thing I got?
[115:38.79]I got moon gravity and shit on.
[115:41.19]Okay, I gotta... Hold on, let me turn that off.
[115:47.65]Moon gravity rainbow road.
[115:51.26]I mean, what is it?
[115:52.22]The mod was not meant to be taken seriously.
[115:53.66]This is me learning the files and having some fun.
[115:56.84]This is the total carnage mod.
[116:05.59]Let's try it.
[116:07.21]Do I have to do anything here?
[116:12.95]More mods?
[116:13.43]There really aren't that many.
[116:14.85]There's a lot of nice trackpacks.
[116:17.42]But besides that...
[116:19.14]There's not a whole lot of other things.
[116:22.06]There's a lot of car reskins and all that stuff.
[116:24.98]Alright, custom event.
[116:26.70]You have active game modifications.
[116:29.41]That's fine.
[116:31.93]Let's just go into the grass.
[116:34.79]Demolition arena.
[116:35.59]Event option, 23 people.
[116:38.19]We got a mod on.
[116:41.10]Sunrise, that's fine.
[116:42.36]AI is set to super vans.
[116:45.00]Doesn't matter.
[116:47.13]Difficulty is fine.
[116:48.37]Driving difficulty is summary.
[116:49.65]Let's just try it.
[116:53.81]This is just with carnage on.
[116:55.68]Here we go.
[117:04.56]Three, two, one.
[117:05.62]Let's go.
[117:16.45]Alright, what's the big carnage here?
[117:18.09]Is there supposed to be carnage?
[117:33.32]What, is this extra damage?
[117:37.90]Well, they did say they were just testing it.
[117:46.87]Was Carnage just a damage setting?
[117:48.99]It might have been.
[117:53.43]I guess so.
[117:53.83]Alright, let's do a race.
[118:01.84]Did I just say DTF?
[118:05.44]Down to... Wait, what?
[118:06.44]No, okay, no.
[118:07.42]Never mind.
[118:10.74]Did not finish.
[118:12.04]Whatever, I get it.
[118:12.62]Alright, let's turn that off.
[118:14.38]Let's get back into multiplayer here.
[118:20.29]Restart the game.
[118:24.21]Why?
[118:25.47]Why not?
[118:29.17]Let's do a race.
[118:34.26]And yeah, again, I'm sorry that the stream was very erratic tonight.
[118:39.42]But I did want to come back and at least play for like an hour or two.
[118:43.88]This is kind of cool, though.
[118:45.75]I have some money, don't I?
[118:48.60]Can I get a different car?
[118:51.12]Choose your car.
[118:56.74]I guess maybe not.
[118:57.53]I think I have to do the career mode.
[118:59.47]Multiplayer.
[118:59.95]Alright, looking for a race.
[119:03.95]Just a banger race.
[119:08.17]Big Valley Speedway.
[119:10.30]Is there anything besides banger race?
[119:11.60]Is that just a race?
[119:15.98]Very track pack.
[119:18.44]Oh, wait, this is... If you have the mod, you can put this on.
[119:21.21]Okay.
[119:24.37]Play as Bowser.
[119:25.33]Alright, let's just get into one here.
[119:28.07]This one is... U.S.
[119:29.81]Dirty Eights and Demo Derby.
[119:31.58]Bang a race.
[119:33.00]It's eight laps now.
[119:36.38]Twelve laps.

[119:47.93]Uh, let's just get into... Two laps left.
[119:51.51]This one's already going.
[119:54.35]Four laps.
[119:55.11]Bang a race.
[119:56.59]Uh, this one people already have people in there.
[119:58.41]We don't want to, like, just fuck up their game.
[120:01.93]How much did I pay for this?
[120:02.77]I've owned this game for about three years.
[120:04.69]I bought this game in early access and made a video on it a long time ago when it was just a playground.
[120:11.04]Uh... Let's go back to the filters here.
[120:13.78]Open...
[120:15.96]um race not in progress banger race team race see if we can get anything here I mean this one motor motor city circuit banger race two laps this one here this is the silly party car video game yep that was this game
[120:45.52]So this is just a race.
[120:47.88]Try to win.
[120:51.19]Not going to last the two maps.
[120:52.59]Probably not.
[120:54.21]I'm going to try.
[120:54.67]I'm going to try to win the game.
[120:56.51]I will do my best.
[121:01.07]Fire.
[121:01.41]We're going to get in the Firefly.
[121:03.41]No, not that one.
[121:04.17]This one.
[121:04.45]This is a more muscle card.
[121:10.54]This one's kind of interesting.
[121:12.92]It's very narrow.
[121:16.68]Make sure you get in, learn to ready up.
[121:20.48]Ready your cars up.
[121:22.78]Wrong car class, oh shit.
[121:24.94]Max class C. C, C, the Firefly is a C. Well, it looks like we're gonna pick it.
[121:36.34]Alright, I'm ready.
[121:41.49]Rocket, rocket, what is a rocket?
[121:43.43]Is a rocket a good car?
[121:49.53]Oh, fuck.
[121:49.77]I must drop this.
[121:52.03]Rat boys.
[121:54.37]Rocket is just the first car.
[121:55.85]Oh, okay.
[121:58.40]The bus is C class?
[122:01.04]Just get in the bus.
[122:09.13]Firefly is really bad.
[122:13.57]It'll be fine.
[122:15.61]Alright, make sure you're ready up.
[122:17.17]If you're not ready, 60 seconds, hit A. If you don't, if you've got a controller in your hand, hit A. If you have a keyboard in front of you, press the enter button.
[122:24.77]Get that car picked and let's get it going.
[122:28.57]Two laps.
[122:34.21]This is the watered down streamer.
[122:37.39]Yeah, quite literally, actually.
[122:40.31]That sucked so bad, dude.
[122:41.86]Were you here when that happened?
[122:45.64]My house is an absolute fucking disaster right now.
[122:48.06]It's an absolute wreck.
[122:53.24]Dude, I'm not even kidding, Etalyx.
[122:55.28]My upstairs bathroom was like plop, plop, plop, plop water all over the whole thing.
[123:01.19]The whole thing.
[123:03.03]It came all the way down into the basement.
[123:06.63]I'm not ready?
[123:07.25]Yes, I am.
[123:10.57]I'm ready.
[123:11.73]Ready, see?
[123:13.89]Alright, let's do it.
[123:15.53]Just a race.
[123:17.79]And not only that, it was toilet water.
[123:19.15]It was like shit water.
[123:21.01]And I don't want to think about that, but it was.
[123:23.27]It was water.
[123:26.86]Leave that bad voodoo in Massachusetts, I know, really.
[123:29.40]Alright, let's try to win.
[123:36.00]It all takes one guy to drive into a sign and fucks it all up.
[123:44.83]Watch out, just don't get caught up in the disaster, and you'll be fine.
[123:47.59]Yep, see?
[123:51.73]Just avoid... No, no, it's pulling to the right.
[123:59.52]No!
[124:01.08]My precious car.
[124:03.84]Just don't die here.
[124:05.08]My whole right side is destroyed.
[124:07.46]Anytime there's a... I don't know what it is, man, but every time there's a right or left-handed turn, seven people die.
[124:18.11]No, not like this.
[124:18.85]Not like this.
[124:19.27]Not like this.
[124:19.69]Not like this.
[124:20.09]Don't do this.
[124:20.59]Not like this.
[124:21.97]Just wait till the carnage is over.
[124:26.64]Alright.
[124:28.08]Okay.
[124:30.50]You will not believe how hard this is.
[124:31.94]What are you doing?
[124:36.48]Suspension damage.
[124:37.43]What's wrong with me?
[124:40.01]No.
[124:40.49]Just get out of this.
[124:41.71]There's like a bunch of fucking morons at the back driving into each other.
[124:48.42]This car is going to explode.
[124:54.43]It's a bunch of fucking dummies.
[124:59.03]All the back there.
[124:59.95]Why?
[125:00.17]What's with the lag?
[125:06.46]You're one of the morons.
[125:07.56]I know.
[125:08.32]That's what I'm saying.
[125:09.04]We're all back here.
[125:10.14]I'm part of the morons.
[125:11.44]Look, that guy's just driving the other direction.
[125:15.47]Look at the guy on the top left here.
[125:16.85]Why is he just, like, sliding?
[125:19.95]What the fuck happened?
[125:21.01]I'm still good.
[125:26.49]I have my Model T. Critical damage.
[125:37.16]I'm alright.
[125:37.50]I'm still 13 out of 23.
[125:39.14]Second lap coming up here.
[125:43.64]Hold on, I'm gonna be careful, careful, careful, careful!
[125:45.48]Don't do it!
[125:47.42]Alright, I just gotta watch out.
[125:49.52]I just have to finish the goddamn race.
[125:50.84]I have seven health.
[126:02.64]The car is on fire.
[126:07.04]Just go?
[126:07.56]What do you mean just go?
[126:08.46]I need to stay alive.
[126:10.74]The slightest bump is going to destroy the car.
[126:18.22]Look at all these people I'm about to pass.
[126:21.14]Slow and steady wins the race.
[126:22.68]14.
[126:25.98]You're stuck outside the track?
[126:31.88]Don't go too fast.
[126:37.35]Look at how cautious everybody is.
[126:41.91]What is this person doing?
[126:45.03]Somebody won.
[126:50.66]Yeah, I told you there was a couple of dickies over there.
[126:54.97]Driving backwards.
[126:56.41]Lookit, he's just driving backwards.
[127:02.51]No, no, don't do it, please!
[127:04.79]I'm almost ready.
[127:06.73]I'm almost ready.
[127:08.35]Look at the litter that's all over the place.
[127:17.30]I need to finish a race.
[127:22.76]I got an assist there, yep.
[127:26.00]Almost to the end.
[127:30.39]You didn't think I'd say a lot?
[127:31.33]Come in one health.
[127:33.35]I knew what his plan was.
[127:34.31]I don't care if I come in 13th.
[127:36.19]Nobody behind me, right?
[127:36.81]I have one health.
[127:38.91]Don't you fucking dare.
[127:41.15]No, what?
[127:41.87]The finish line's right there.
[127:42.61]Come on, get across.
[127:44.79]The finish line.
[127:57.60]Okay.
[128:01.11]What's my need another class C?
[128:02.61]Let's do the mud car.
[128:05.83]Go into a new map.
[128:10.75]Have four buses protect me.
[128:13.53]You saw what happened when I tried to make buses listen to my words coming out of my mouth as audio.
[128:19.74]Didn't work.
[128:22.10]This is a figure eight.
[128:24.52]Max class is C.
[128:29.82]A, B, C, D. Let's do the double decker.
[128:33.52]We haven't seen it yet, so... I'm ready.
[128:46.65]Bosses are very disobedient.
[128:48.19]Yeah, they are.
[128:50.81]We tried to have...
[128:54.37]Not ready?
[128:54.73]What do you mean not ready?
[128:56.17]Wrong car model.
[128:57.05]What?
[128:57.26]It's Class C!
[128:58.38]Oh, no special cars.
[129:01.60]Damn it.
[129:05.78]I'll go back to the mud car.
[129:06.80]This one can take a lot of beating.
[129:07.94]Alright, let's go.
[129:15.49]That's an upper decker?
[129:17.15]Yeah, I don't know who upper deckered my toilet, but it destroyed my house.
[129:22.36]And speaking of which, after, like, another one or two of these races, I gotta go back.
[129:27.68]I gotta leave.
[129:28.92]I did just want to make sure I came back to, like, tell everybody that I'm alright.
[129:32.32]And that, like, I have to fix the problem, but... Sorry, that was a very erratic, fucked up day today.
[129:43.53]And although we didn't get to do... I mean, we get to do a few things, but... Sorry for my kind of scatterbrain here.
[129:54.81]then hopefully it's not a too big of a problem where I can still stream tomorrow and we can do the emote contest but that like fucks it all up because I think I gotta spend the next I think I'm just gonna say it now let's just do it now let's say it now um the emote contest is not gonna be tomorrow it'll be we'll do it on Wednesday because I there's a lot of cleanup that I still have to do and I gotta get somebody over here like I just can't do it
[130:20.74]I don't want to have to have a problem where... We'll do it on Wednesday.
[130:24.28]So, move it to one day, Wednesday.
[130:28.04]Did I just get through a secret?
[130:30.03]No, wait.
[130:30.69]Hold on.
[130:31.37]This is a figure eight.
[130:33.45]Wait, how did I go the wrong...
[130:44.55]Fucked everything up.
[130:46.07]Okay.
[130:47.35]I'm one of the dickies.
[130:50.49]I'm one of the fucking idiots.
[130:52.77]I'm the idiot.
[130:54.87]What direction is the correct direction?
[131:00.80]No, I didn't get in the right... Reset.
[131:03.36]Car reset disabled for this event.
[131:05.18]I just need to figure out how to go.
[131:07.20]Which is the correct way?
[131:19.20]There's no correct direction.
[131:22.20]I have to go back here.
[131:23.18]How am I in 21st place?
[131:33.64]I'm not in the last place.
[131:34.78]Doesn't that seem odd?
[131:36.67]There we go.
[131:36.99]Going the right way.
[131:44.62]Yeah, I'm fine.
[131:46.28]Hey, I think the engine light just came on.
[131:50.50]You're probably right.
[131:54.62]Yeah, I'm moving to 19.
[131:55.68]I'm just going to slowly complete this 10 fucking laps.
[132:03.61]I guess it's the short laps, huh?
[132:09.37]Ooh, ow.
[132:12.51]Is there a nitro boost or something?
[132:17.85]I'm doing alright.
[132:18.83]I'm slowly starting to climb back here.
[132:24.43]People are doing the same thing I'm doing.
[132:26.13]There's at least five people doing what I just did.
[132:30.62]The people I'm passing, I'm not even sure what... I'm going to explode.
[132:42.92]The lag is real on this one.
[132:46.00]All the debris still in 18th place.
[133:01.79]You know what's really hard about Wreckfest?
[133:04.37]Finishing a race.
[133:06.73]Is you just explode.
[133:09.59]One guy just has to get to first place and just make sure he drives correctly.
[133:13.74]Everybody else just mashes into each other.
[133:27.57]What did they rip off?
[133:30.11]Oh, it's one of the bits that just came in.
[133:38.40]Wow.
[133:38.64]17.
[133:38.66]16.
[133:38.92]6 out of 10 here.
[133:44.94]15.
[133:44.96]14.
[133:51.40]Keep climbing.
[133:52.56]Keep climbing, man.
[133:54.98]I'm going to get hit by that.
[134:04.23]God damn it.
[134:04.81]No, don't.
[134:05.47]No, god damn it.
[134:06.85]It's fucking 12.
[134:07.90]I'm already one already.
[134:10.56]That person was three laps ahead of us.
[134:14.82]Car's gonna explode.
[134:21.26]13th, though.
[134:24.61]I want you guys to remember something.
[134:28.25]I came in at least the top... I'm in the top 50% of people that started this race.
[134:35.73]That's not bad.
[134:37.11]That's not bad.
[134:42.23]I mean, I'm probably not going to finish the race, but that's a top 50% streamer right there.
[134:48.22]That's true.
[134:48.56]12 out of 22.
[134:49.22]We made it to the top 50 percentile.
[134:50.36]10 out of 22.
[134:50.88]Come on, give me the fourth place or something.
[135:01.64]People are just exploding left and right.
[135:08.79]Damn it.
[135:09.15]Alright, well, it's alright.
[135:09.75]I finished number 10.
[135:10.35]Alright, let's do one more, and then I gotta get going.
[135:16.03]I'm just super paranoid about, you know, going upstairs and seeing... Oh, wow!
[135:19.87]It started again!
[135:20.90]If I turn the water off, there's no way it will, but... You know, I need to be, like, on top of that.
[135:26.22]I can't just not go back and do it.
[135:30.90]Uh, going to new map.
[135:36.15]You have a house disaster and you come back to play Wreckfest.
[135:45.25]Yeah, whatever.
[135:50.15]Honestly, the purpose of coming back was because I wanted to do the school bus thing.
[135:54.74]And also to make sure people know, don't worry.
[135:56.60]Because I did just abruptly, like, I gotta go, bye!
[135:58.60]And turned off the stream, so... I did want to come back and make sure people are aware that... Like, I'm fine.
[136:03.80]The house is okay.
[136:05.24]It's just gonna be a pain in the ass.
[136:07.67]Which is why we have to move tomorrow's stream to Wednesday.
[136:12.59]And I need to take my... I had to take my brain off of it.
[136:14.85]It's just... I can't... I told you, when I was up there, I couldn't even... I was just seriously...
[136:23.43]It was like I had to take my mind off it.
[136:24.85]It was just pissing me off.
[136:28.43]I don't want people to worry, you know?
[136:30.63]Alright, this is just standard race.
[136:31.67]Let's try it again.
[136:32.95]I'm... I gotta try.
[136:38.56]Last race of the night.
[136:39.44]I gotta try to finish it.
[136:40.74]That's right.
[136:43.86]Where's my phone?
[136:44.68]Oh, it's upstairs.
[136:52.20]Yeah, really erratic night tonight.
[136:55.52]Starting and stopping streaming for like an hour, starting and stopping streaming for like an hour and a half.
[137:00.27]And I am going to miss a bunch of subs too.
[137:02.21]I'm sorry.
[137:09.45]I didn't even see the clip, by the way.
[137:11.73]I'm going to watch this.
[137:12.86]Like, how fucking weird does this look?
[137:15.30]Oh boy, that's bad.
[137:17.24]Oh, this is bad.
[137:17.86]This is really bad.
[137:18.42]I have to end the stream.
[137:20.30]My ceiling is leaking right now.
[137:22.37]I'm not even kidding.
[137:22.93]I'm not fucking around.
[137:24.59]I'm not even fucking kidding.
[137:26.13]I want to see it.
[137:28.67]I wish I was fucking kidding right now, guys.
[137:30.34]Oh, damn.
[137:30.84]This is bad.
[137:33.36]Not kidding.
[137:34.00]I gotta go.
[137:35.64]Not kidding.
[137:36.90]I wonder if you're kidding.
[137:40.06]Oh, no.
[137:40.44]This is bad fucking news.
[137:41.98]No!
[137:42.54]I gotta go.
[137:45.01]Oh, that sucks.
[137:46.91]Alright, let's go.
[137:50.05]Just don't get a ton of damage done.
[137:53.85]Guys, I'm not kidding.
[137:55.39]I'm not kidding.
[137:57.25]He's not kidding.
[138:00.47]Good job on getting the camera so quick.
[138:01.83]Well... I mean, it was kind of an insane happening.
[138:05.96]I had to at least get it recorded, right?
[138:10.68]That's nothing.
[138:11.58]Remember, that came through two floors.
[138:14.78]If I had been able to show you guys upstairs, you would be a lot more concerned than you probably are.
[138:25.81]What?
[138:26.01]Where are you kidding?
[138:27.09]Yeah, I went through two floors.
[138:36.37]Remember, I'm all the way down in the basement.
[138:39.53]That water came from my upstairs fucking bathroom.
[138:45.70]My wheels are all jacked up here.
[138:49.76]It's something that has to be dealt with.
[138:51.12]And it sucks because this is... Right before moving.
[138:55.27]Like, in... It's almost like somebody's playing a prank on me.
[139:00.49]Oh, hey, you were gonna move and you got... No, hold on a second.
[139:02.81]You have, like, a bunch of water damage to your house now.
[139:05.09]It's like, give me a break.
[139:08.88]Whatever.
[139:09.20]This one's tight.
[139:14.48]No!
[139:18.59]Is it going to affect me selling my place?
[139:24.86]Probably.
[139:26.46]Yeah.
[139:28.06]Because I have to make sure there's no... It has to pass an inspection and shit, you know what I'm saying?
[139:33.63]I have to make sure it's not going to be a problem.
[139:40.42]From my understanding, it's... I'm in eighth place.
[139:44.21]From my understanding, it's not going to be that big of a deal.
[139:46.31]I just need to wait for it to dry, and then I might need to chip out the upstairs ceiling and replace some of the ceiling there.
[139:54.47]Which shouldn't be that big of a deal.
[139:56.51]But I hope that's all that needs to be done.
[139:58.71]The whole thing needs to dry first.
[140:06.60]I bet I took a huge shit and clogged the toilet.
[140:10.57]I don't think so, because there was nothing wrong with it earlier.
[140:13.49]I used it earlier.
[140:17.11]I didn't take a dump in it.
[140:18.15]I just peed in it, and it flushed fine.
[140:19.75]There was nothing wrong.
[140:21.91]It's like, I think something happened with the way the water is in.
[140:24.04]Hold on.
[140:25.42]I don't want to die here.
[140:30.54]I had a thick molasses piss that clogged up the toilet apparently.
[140:35.54]That guy tried.
[140:37.26]Speaking of somebody trying, this person is still fucking up my day.
[140:40.48]He just ruined everything.
[140:43.01]I can't believe he just did that.
[140:44.53]He was connected to me.
[140:51.53]Almost there.
[140:51.99]Come on.
[141:03.85]All those years of thick, loud piss.
[141:07.83]Can I drive through this?
[141:20.88]I almost did.
[141:22.30]I almost got through it.
[141:25.37]This dude is just going all over the place.
[141:27.01]You see this guy?
[141:28.03]Skidding the fuck around.
[141:32.34]It was covered with a bunch of debris.
[141:33.48]I couldn't tell.
[141:43.88]Finish the race.
[141:44.56]Come on.
[141:46.40]Do not... No.
[141:51.46]Thought about it.
[141:52.40]Didn't get it.
[141:52.90]I need to get... I fucking finished.
[141:54.48]Just finished the race.
[141:55.93]It's right there.
[141:56.61]We're so close.
[141:58.27]Give me the speed boost.
[141:59.05]Thanks, man.
[141:59.83]Eighth place.
[142:00.91]I'll take it.
[142:05.29]This netcode is awful.
[142:06.23]I think it's just because a lot of people are connecting from kind of all over the world at the moment.
[142:11.17]But I finished a race.
[142:17.28]But thanks everybody for playing.
[142:19.16]And thanks everybody for watching.
[142:22.22]Again, I need to apologize again for having sort of an insane stream tonight.
[142:28.91]Much love to you.
[142:30.32]We'll start fresh with the emote contest on Wednesday.
[142:33.66]So nothing tomorrow.
[142:34.64]I gotta deal with this.
[142:36.84]So have a good rest of your night.
[142:39.78]We're gonna do the credits.
[142:41.04]It's gonna miss like half the people that were here.
[142:43.97]I'm sorry about that.
[142:50.27]Have a great rest of your night, guys.
[142:51.67]Take care.
[142:52.05]See you guys on Wednesday for the emote contest.
[142:55.08]We should have a lot of fun.
[142:56.18]That stream's going to be a lot of fun.
[142:57.24]It just is.
[142:58.14]I'm looking forward to it.
[142:59.80]It's going to have voting.
[143:02.68]It's going to show up on screen.
[143:05.12]Trust me, it'll be a fun stream.
[143:08.33]Now I have to go fix the water damage in my house.
[143:11.75]Have a great rest of your night.
[143:13.05]Let's do the credits.
[143:15.77]And here they come.
[143:20.54]He's going to scroll really slowly because there's probably not very many because of the time period here.
[143:25.85]That means I won't be able to mess up any of them.
[143:29.33]Hey, Spencer455446, thanks for the sub.

[146:18.77]I'm really sorry.
[146:22.93]But let's get to it.
[146:27.05]Uh, where did they go?
[146:31.39]So we have...
[146:34.77]Oh boy, yeah, this is all fucked up.
[146:40.19]No, actually, I can see the... No, I got it here.
[146:42.55]I'm good.
[146:42.81]Alright, let's go back a few hours ago.
[146:50.88]Thank you so much, everybody.
[146:51.88]Thank you to Sir Jaden for the $1.
[146:54.18]Is Jerma going to have a rematch with the giant enemy spider?
[146:58.72]He's gone.
[146:59.12]I don't know where he is.
[146:59.92]He's probably in some corner somewhere.
[147:02.44]He might have gotten flooded out because the water came through the light up here.
[147:06.62]I'm assuming there's all kinds of bugs up there in the light.
[147:09.50]They're attracted to it.
[147:10.46]He's probably dead.
[147:11.80]I didn't do it, though.
[147:14.16]Thank you, Jayden.
[147:14.70]Thank you, Dreamsicle, again, for the $50.
[147:15.92]Thank you so much.
[147:17.46]Darkstar for the $1.
[147:19.90]Question about the emote contest.
[147:21.30]Are bribes allowed?
[147:22.24]Because if not, I totally get it.
[147:23.46]But if they are, let's just say I got a whole four more dollars in my wallet.
[147:28.51]Nope, no bribes are allowed.
[147:29.65]And I'm not going to tell you anything about the ones that I think are cool.
[147:33.29]There's going to be a bunch that you're going to see on screen and we're going to vote for them.
[147:36.91]That's it.
[147:37.87]I'm going to stay incredibly neutral.
[147:39.27]I'm going to have the facecam on the whole time so you'll be able to see my neutral face.
[147:44.14]I've taken a bunch of courses on how to act neutral.
[147:47.24]It'll be good.
[147:51.80]Thank you.
[147:53.25]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the $1.
[147:54.57]Hey, Jeremiah, I remember you talked about it a while back, but has there been any update on your... Almost got me to say it.
[147:59.79]You almost... You had a... That was a good shot, but thank you, MostlyLost, for the $1.
[148:03.43]Thank you to Lorag for the $250.
[148:07.96]We touched upon these huge amounts of money in a row here.
[148:11.36]Lorag, thank you so much.
[148:12.76]Thank you, Vertiquad, for the $50.
[148:15.98]CodBTV for the $100.

[148:51.36]You have talked about it.
[148:54.44]I know, I'm fucking around.
[148:56.56]Yeah, Otto's fine.
[148:57.97]He was actually just hanging out upstairs in my bedroom, and my bedroom is connected... So I have a bedroom connected to this bathroom, and the water seeped over into the carpets on the other side of the wall, and he was in that room, but he was in his dog bed, which is across the other side, so he had no... He didn't even know what the hell was going on.
[149:17.46]He was lying down.
[149:20.03]Yeah, it sucks.
[149:20.59]This is like... I'm like laughing through this right now and hanging out with you guys, but this is actually like a huge fucking awful pain in the ass.
[149:28.84]But, whatever.
[149:30.06]You can't cry over spilt water in your house.
[149:33.79]You just gotta do it.
[149:34.77]I gotta deal with it.
[149:35.37]I have to deal with it.
[149:36.31]That's it.
[149:39.76]Uh, Kali Brady, thanks for the three bucks.
[149:41.34]Hey, Jerma, take these bits and get yourself some flex tape.
[149:43.66]Much love.
[149:44.00]Hope the water issue doesn't get you any worse.
[149:46.86]I don't think it will, but you have to wait.
[149:48.54]I have to wait till it dries.
[149:50.20]And then that's how you can determine what actually is wrong and how much damage there is, actually.
[149:56.75]But thank you.
[149:57.41]I appreciate that.
[149:59.81]Uh, thank you, uh, Kaiju Guts for the five bucks.
[150:02.29]Can't believe your luck, dude.
[150:03.29]Hope everything gets better.
[150:04.71]Sending good vibes your way.
[150:07.93]Thank you so much.
[150:09.77]Appreciate that.
[150:11.01]Thank you for the support.
[150:15.97]Scripps3, thanks for the $1.50.
[150:17.41]Cheer150, thank you.
[150:20.77]Kyra Toby, give $100 too.
[150:22.43]Thank you so much, man.
[150:25.58]Use these bits to flex tape the ceiling.
[150:29.02]I'm just going to flex tape the whole room.
[150:32.14]But thank you, Kyra.
[150:35.27]It's a lot of money.
[150:35.91]You guys have showered me.
[150:38.69]I've been showered in more than water tonight.
[150:40.77]So... Thank you guys.
[150:45.53]Tingy, thanks for the one dollar.
[150:46.69]Well, since you haven't dealt with that, I guess we could call you the real-life equivalent of Mario.
[150:52.41]You're short, a plumber.
[150:53.65]The only thing you're missing is the Italian part.
[150:56.17]I'm not a plumber.
[150:58.99]I'm not a plumber and I'm not Italian.
[151:02.15]And I'm taller than Mario.
[151:03.97]Mario's like three feet tall.
[151:06.25]So, I'm sorry, but that's incorrect.
[151:09.59]Uh, Derange, thanks for the $12.
[151:11.15]Donating to the fund to turn your house into a water park.
[151:17.87]Thank you for the $12, Derange.
[151:21.31]Jamie2803, thanks for the $15.
[151:23.73]He says, love you mate with hearts.
[151:25.25]Thank you.
[151:25.53]It means a lot.
[151:29.64]Thank you guys.
[151:32.36]I am Monk.
[151:33.00]Thanks for the $1.
[151:33.48]Here's the last of my bits.
[151:35.60]We love you, Jerbo.
[151:36.43]Keep your head up.
[151:37.19]Also, boner soup, as always.
[151:42.37]That's a fast leak.
[151:43.09]You need to get that fixed as soon as possible.
[151:44.89]Well, what happened... It's not happening anymore.
[151:49.49]I killed the water to the house, essentially.
[151:52.91]So the water that's going to that toilet is off.
[151:56.91]It's not even flowing there anymore.
[151:59.11]So I have to figure out what the fuck is going on.
[152:01.62]I killed the water.
[152:04.75]Thank you to Carton22 for the $10.
[152:08.25]No message, just $10.
[152:09.95]Thank you.

[152:54.23]Thank you, Etalyx.
[152:54.83]Here's the small loan you texted me for earlier to fix the house.
[152:57.99]Make sure you give this back after you sell it.
[152:59.77]I'm on a tight budget, so I think 5,000% interest is fair.
[153:02.67]Thanks, Etalyx.
[153:03.33]Appreciate that, dude.
[153:06.52]Thank you, Badyata, for the 10 bucks.
[153:08.42]Donate to the Jerma charity, folks.

[153:18.94]I appreciate it, though.
[153:19.68]Thank you, dude.
[153:21.57]Fae Toru, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[153:22.87]This is entirely necessary.

[153:26.11]You can't tell me what to do.
[153:29.09]That's correct.
[153:29.67]I cannot tell you what to do.
[153:32.27]Thank you.
[153:33.41]Fae Toru.
[153:34.30]Fae Toru.
[153:38.06]Resident Dark Souls bodyguard.
[153:39.68]Thank you, Fae.
[153:42.13]Darkstar, thank you for the $1, Darkstar.
[153:44.77]I thought I'd kick in a few bucks to fix your ceiling unless, again, you take bribes.
[153:49.30]Unless, in which case, consider this a bribe.
[153:50.92]I don't take bribes.
[153:52.70]I don't, but thank you.
[153:54.98]Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.33.

[154:07.39]It will be taken care of.
[154:10.63]Clueless sniper, thanks for the $1.
[154:11.95]Waterman strikes again on the bright side.
[154:14.25]Look who came in the mail today.
[154:17.59]Oh, is it?
[154:18.49]It's your Fireman shirt.
[154:19.65]Nice.
[154:22.50]Oh, I got my Fireman shirt too.
[154:23.90]I forgot.
[154:24.46]It's in the back of my car.
[154:26.68]I literally just got it.
[154:28.40]I was so excited.
[154:32.88]I got my Fireman shirt.
[154:35.92]Thanks, dude.
[154:37.08]Looks good.
[154:40.43]It's so funny because like there's the fireman shirt and then like coincidentally enough I I'm go here's let me tell you what's gonna happen here.
[154:48.92]Here's another little bit of information so I'm going to Uh bring back the Glue Man shirt and have a new shirt on sale This is gonna happen probably in like a maybe like a month or two So I got a lot of people who have wanted that shirt back
[155:07.10]I'm doing a new shirt.
[155:09.14]It's actually been like in the process of being made for like nine months, but never got around to actually having it finished.
[155:18.03]It's going to be, I can't wait to wear it.
[155:19.63]It's going to be awesome.
[155:20.71]So new shirt and I'm going to bring the Glue Man shirt back for the same period.
[155:27.05]Maybe in like a month or two.
[155:27.93]We'll see.
[155:31.04]Please make it ship to your country.
[155:32.28]It will, but it's going to be Teespring.
[155:35.12]So it's going to cost a bunch of money to ship it internationally just because that's how Teespring works.
[155:40.22]I'm sorry about that, but that's like the easiest place to sell a t-shirt is on Teespring.
[155:47.43]But thank you, Clue the Sniper.
[155:48.51]Thank you, Sturdy Bread for the $3.65 ad revenue.

[158:06.88]I feel like that, like, people that were here on the stream, I'm not going to talk about it again.
[158:11.56]Unless I have to.
[158:12.96]So, I'll, like, take a picture of it and, like, tomorrow or something, I'll put it in the chat.
[158:17.96]Because I don't want to, like, tweet that out.
[158:20.04]That'll, like, people will... I don't want to make people nervous or anything.
[158:24.56]Maybe before the stream on Wednesday, I'll put it in the chat to see if it keeps you curious.

[161:26.33]This is not me.
[161:33.14]Printed in the USA.
[161:34.86]Really now?
[161:37.68]Interesting.
[161:39.90]That means we got jurisdiction!
[161:52.87]No, that's weird.
[161:54.81]What the hell is this website?
[161:55.97]I don't even want to say it out loud.
[162:01.74]Alright, thanks for bringing that to my attention.
[162:03.50]That's a little odd.
[162:09.44]Oh, lawyer up.
[162:10.54]That's time to lawyer up.
[162:15.89]Thanks for telling me that.
[162:16.69]That's strange.
[162:20.87]There's like a bunch of places where they're being sold.
[162:23.69]God.
[162:27.65]Just the thie- the thievery.
[162:30.36]They have an accredited business sign at the bottom of their site.

[168:00.31]It's just timing-wise, this is just... Couldn't be worse for timing.
[168:05.75]Thank you.
[168:08.59]Thank you.
[168:09.07]I am mostly moistened for the $1.
[168:10.71]I have watched dozens of Wreckfest streams.
[168:13.63]Never before have I seen someone go an entire stream without finishing a single race.
[168:18.17]You do not finish every single time.
[168:21.76]Until the end.
[168:23.16]Which we did.
[168:24.52]But hold on, though.
[168:25.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[168:25.94]Before everybody starts calling me a dummy and a fucking dicky.
[168:30.29]We only did, like, a few races.
[168:32.89]We did mostly, like, Destruction Derby, like, setting up school bus bits.
[168:38.27]Like, we didn't really do very many races.
[168:40.64]We did, like, three.
[168:45.01]I was a DTF dickie.
[168:46.59]It doesn't matter.
[168:47.25]Like, I had fun.
[168:48.99]But I'm sorry that I was not a player up to the standards of the Wreckfest, the current Wreckfest pre-pre-preval.
[168:57.25]Thank you.
[168:59.31]Hey, Prime Vino, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[169:00.83]After your speech on Soylent a few streams ago, I had a revelation.
[169:05.19]It's as if someone ripped off.
[169:08.59]I think we might get the second part of that here.
[169:10.79]Thank you, Prime Vino, for the 10 bucks.
[169:12.21]Thank you to Garfield, the Monday Killer.
[169:14.96]Sorry about the leaky roof, Jerma.
[169:16.32]I've had a similar problem in my second house not too long ago.
[169:19.43]It was one of the most disgusting things I've had to deal with.
[169:21.95]I had to pierce holes into my roof with a knife in order to drain my ceiling.
[169:26.05]The entire toilet had to be replaced.
[169:28.23]To make matters worse, it's on a Monday on top of that.
[169:30.41]I swear Monday streams are cursed.
[169:33.37]And we get a comic book here.
[169:37.52]Let's see what the comic book is.
[169:41.50]Panel 1.
[169:42.24]Garfield, Goofy, and Bugs Bunny.
[169:43.80]Okay, they're walking along.
[169:46.46]Look, Garfield, it's the giant rat.
[169:47.80]And he says, yuck.
[169:49.38]Truly the deadest of Jerma memes.
[169:50.96]It'll let us move on, Garfield.
[169:52.08]Our humor is far too refined for such juvenile garbage.
[169:56.30]And then... Okay, that... Oh, this one's pretty good.
[170:00.14]This one's... You know what?
[170:01.10]This one's good.
[170:01.62]This one's actually very good.
[170:04.20]This is a great comic panel here.
[170:09.01]Thank you, Garfield.
[170:10.19]Appreciate the concern as well.
[170:11.49]Thank you, DubskiDude, for the $1.
[170:12.49]Dude, I really hate to be a buzzkill, but all the loud P's you've taken probably offended your toilet to the point where it's actively trying to drown you.
[170:20.10]Try being quieter next time.
[170:24.40]Maybe.
[170:25.24]Maybe next time.
[170:26.56]Hey, PrimeVino, here it is.
[170:27.52]Thanks, PrimeVino, for the five dollars.
[170:29.21]Doing this again since I fucked up.
[170:30.77]Alright, well, let's see what he says.
[170:32.59]After your speech on Soylent a few streams ago, I had a revelation as if somebody ripped off my eyelids and shoved my face into a searchlight, forever burning its message into my eyes.
[170:40.99]Okay.
[170:41.87]Me.
[170:42.17]There you go.
[170:43.27]I went to my bank and took out all my savings and a second mortgage on my house to buy 3,000 pounds of Soylent.
[170:50.91]Well...
[170:52.08]I didn't tell you to do that.
[170:53.50]That was on you.
[170:54.22]If it were me, I would have told you not to buy it.
[170:55.84]But that was on you.
[170:57.52]I had nothing to do with that.
[170:58.28]And just to make sure people that weren't here before, that this is not him.
[171:02.63]My speech on Soylent was not, hey, go buy a bunch of Soylent.
[171:05.13]It was don't buy Soylent.
[171:06.15]No, it wasn't don't buy it.
[171:07.63]It was just like don't buy it.
[171:09.33]It was like don't purchase it.
[171:11.21]If somebody gave one to you at like a barbecue, you could drink it.
[171:18.44]Thank you.
[171:18.78]It's time for slime for the 10 bucks.
[171:20.10]Hey, Jeremy, your stream has inspired me to animate this.
[171:25.81]This is... It's very nice.
[171:32.03]Very well made.
[171:32.69]Thank you.
[171:33.23]It's time for slime for the 10 bucks.
[171:38.20]Appreciate it, man.
[171:38.84]Thank you, Coolest Dakota, for the $1.
[171:40.34]I have to leave for work at like 4.30 p.m.
[171:41.86]Eastern on Wednesday, so I won't get to watch my Jerma BB.
[171:47.21]I won't be able to watch my Jerma BB do a stream on Wednesday.
[171:52.15]I won't be able to see my Jerma BB, you know, me, do a stream on Wednesday.
[171:58.25]That's right.
[171:58.99]Maybe not.
[171:59.37]You won't be there.
[172:02.93]Thank you, though.
[172:03.97]Coolest Dakota.
[172:04.67]Thank you, Ratuna, for the $1.
[172:07.29]This was my all-time favorite streams you've done, Jerma.
[172:10.80]I was in tears laughing the whole time.
[172:12.08]This isn't much, but I hope it can go towards something useful, like fixing the water problem or Vegas.
[172:15.90]jermaRat.
[172:18.58]Thank you, Ratuna.
[172:19.36]I... I... I... Thank you.
[172:25.95]I'm glad you thought it was fun.
[172:27.17]I'm glad you did.
[172:28.15]It was a little... A little more to be desired from my end.
[172:32.45]Just because of, you know, all the bullshit.
[172:34.97]But thank you.
[172:35.51]I appreciate that.
[172:37.89]Thank you, Ratuno.
[172:39.41]Glad you had fun.
[172:41.35]Thank you, NightfangX for this $1 here.
[172:43.57]Hey, Jerma.
[172:44.09]I just learned an important lesson yesterday.
[172:46.41]I learned to never apply Icy Hot on your private area to relieve pain.
[172:55.41]And I would say that that's probably not a good idea either.
[172:58.31]Make sure you wash your hands after you apply.
[173:02.57]Thank you, Cloudy, for the $1.
[173:03.89]Hey, Jermbo, give me my 100 pennies to help you buy some towels for your future water park.
[173:09.16]It's funny you say that.
[173:09.82]I have to get rid of every towel I own.
[173:14.72]I had brand fresh new towels.
[173:18.74]Like 12 of them.
[173:20.58]All of them have to go in the garbage.
[173:22.68]I used every single towel up there.
[173:26.10]And it still took more than that.
[173:30.18]See what I'm doing tomorrow?
[173:31.06]I'm going to Target tomorrow to buy a bunch of cheap towels.
[173:35.61]Just wash them.
[173:36.73]I don't know, man.
[173:38.35]Those towels are sopped up in shit water.
[173:40.55]I don't think I want to do that.
[173:42.23]I don't care.
[173:43.55]I'll buy one towel.
[173:49.91]I don't know if I'd want to use them.
[173:50.86]That's like toilet water.
[173:51.72]That's like poo-poo water.
[173:55.96]I'm gonna buy the cheapest towels I can find.
[173:58.52]I'm moving anyways, it's not a big deal.
[174:05.35]You know there's a shit inside of you right now.
[174:11.07]I mean, yes, I'm aware.
[174:13.74]I am aware of that.
[174:16.92]But thank you, dude.
[174:17.56]Thank you to... Etalyx.
[174:21.00]We already mentioned.
[174:21.65]Thank you, Etalyx.
[174:23.31]We talked about it already.
[174:25.17]Luke Newcomb.
[174:25.85]Thanks for the $1.
[174:27.65]Mostly lost.
[174:28.21]Thanks for the $20.
[174:28.61]Here's a little more.
[174:30.31]Hopefully it can help fix your ceiling so it stops.
[174:34.19]Dabbling in vinegar.
[174:35.20]Thank you.
[174:36.26]Thanks for the $20, man.
[174:40.71]Absolutely, whatever it was, you guys have already paid for it.
[174:42.89]So, whatever damage needs to be repaired, I don't think would be more than like $1,000 or $2,000.
[174:47.84]I hope not.
[174:49.54]But I don't think it's going to be more than that.
[174:55.44]Watch it like V. I don't even want to think about that.
[175:00.19]I don't even want to think.
[175:02.23]We'll talk about that when we have to.
[175:04.01]Okay?
[175:06.23]Don't thank me.
[175:06.87]It wasn't a gift.
[175:07.95]You're not getting that money back ever again, Italicus.
[175:11.31]In fact, next time I see you, I'm going to pull a dollar out in front of you.
[175:15.92]And I'm going to take the dollar and I'm going to buy... Oh, man.
[175:20.72]Lorag again.
[175:26.95]Lorag, thanks for the $350.
[175:27.65]Seriously.
[175:27.97]That's...
[175:39.37]You just gave me like a fucking week's worth of money.
[175:43.72]Seriously, thank you so much, dude.
[175:46.28]I just realized that I accidentally bought a hundred more dollars of bits on accident, so here you go.
[175:54.12]Holy shit, man.
[175:54.76]Thank you, dude.
[175:57.02]I really do appreciate it.
[176:00.31]And I probably, like I said, I'm probably not going to talk too much about this again.
[176:05.66]So regardless of, you know, obviously on Wednesday before the stream, I'll tell everybody like what's going on, but I don't want to keep talking about it because I obviously don't want people to get, you know, nervous or upset about anything.
[176:19.74]So I appreciate it though.
[176:21.88]Thank you guys.
[176:24.36]Probably would.
[176:25.02]They make that shit out of rubber.
[176:26.64]They make gum out of rubber now.
[176:27.40]I got a funny story for you.
[176:28.04]So this one time, I was sitting at my desk.
[176:50.70]just minding my own business, and I was streaming.
[176:54.44]And after about maybe 30 or 40 minutes of streaming, I noticed, well, what's... I said, water is kind of falling from somewhere.
[177:01.39]I looked up, like, to my surprise.
[177:03.80]I looked up and holy shit, man.
[177:05.52]Like, water is coming down from my ceiling.
[177:08.11]I was like, what the fuck?
[177:09.71]I had to turn the stream up.
[177:10.63]I'm not sure if any of you guys have heard this story.
[177:12.24]You guys might have been there.
[177:13.38]I had to panic.
[177:14.38]Water pouring down on my computer, my lap.
[177:16.98]I had to turn the stream off and run upstairs.
[177:18.56]And what do I see?
[177:19.28]My God, the fucking floor is covered in water.
[177:22.95]What the fuck?
[177:26.29]It turns out, thanks to the incredibly generous people in chat, though, I was able to fix that problem.
[177:35.03]Lots of damage was done.
[177:37.41]It was $75,000.
[177:38.63]Thankfully, chat was able to pay for that in full.
[177:42.97]It was really great.
[177:44.01]It turned out alright.
[177:47.35]That's a lot of damage.
[177:50.19]Where's the punchline?
[177:51.03]The punchline is I just said it was $75,000 and you already paid for it.
[177:55.32]There's your punchline.
[178:00.18]You know I need $70,000.
[178:01.30]Thank you, dude.
[178:13.25]Thank you, Eddie.
[178:14.01]Thank you, TechnoToast, for the two bucks.
[178:15.69]Have some more money to fight your cursed toilet.
[178:17.93]Also, I'm happy you're bringing the Glue Man shirt back.
[178:20.59]I always regretted missing out on it when it first came out.
[178:23.47]But I won't miss it this time.
[178:25.71]Yeah, you'll have three weeks.
[178:27.74]I don't have a date for it yet.
[178:28.66]Probably like another month or two.
[178:29.94]Depends on when the other shirt is completely finished.
[178:32.94]Kyra Toby, thanks for the 15 more dollars here.
[178:36.10]Thanks to you, Jerma985, for the years of laughs.
[178:39.52]And he says, thanks to you, Jerma985, for the laughs.
[178:42.44]He says, why am I saying my name so weird?
[178:45.90]Jerma985.
[178:49.60]Thank you, Kyra Toby, for your monumental amount of money.
[178:55.07]Ape808, thanks for the five bucks.
[178:56.40]You've been one of my favorite entertainers for about five years.
[178:59.02]I love your content and I'm excited for you and your big move.
[179:01.50]Hope the rest can go smoothly.
[179:02.66]Thank you.
[179:04.10]Me too.
[179:06.46]With the kind of support that you guys give me on a daily basis.
[179:10.99]Seriously.
[179:11.39]It means a lot.
[179:18.48]Thank you to Spencer455446 for the $1.
[179:21.94]I listen to your sorcery streams every night before I fall asleep to help me sleep.
[179:25.75]You've no idea how much it has helped.
[179:27.67]And one day you will be compensated.
[179:29.33]I already have.
[179:33.95]This message has compensated me.
[179:36.87]What you wrote here already.
[179:39.09]So don't worry about that.
[179:40.13]Thank you, Spencer.
[179:42.96]uh baby got front thanks for the 10 bucks long time viewer first time donator thank you thanks for the ten dollars there thank you casey for the one dollar good night good night to you as well Lorag with a hundred bucks again thank you mostly lost thanks for the six dollars well I'm this close to the next bit badge so I might as well thank you mostly lost
[180:06.65]For the $7, actually.
[180:08.05]I just realized how little self-control I have with finances.
[180:10.55]So, that's... Just be careful.
[180:13.20]Don't give more than you can afford to... You know, don't give me more money than you can afford.
[180:17.76]I would much rather use it on you than me.
[180:21.24]You first.
[180:23.52]And then Soviet Winter for $50.
[180:26.50]This came in.
[180:30.00]You're my favorite streamer.
[180:31.16]Really love all the videos and streams.
[180:32.82]Ceiling's on me, kid.
[180:37.36]For sure.
[180:37.86]Thank you, SovietWinner, for your $50.
[180:41.98]Again, I want to say thank you to everybody here.
[180:49.91]It was actually pretty unbelievable support here.
[180:55.69]Something I think about all the time.
[181:00.56]All I can say is thank you.
[181:04.71]The amount of positive shit that you guys say to me on a daily basis, the amount of money you guys give me is just, is absolutely fucking mind-blowing.
[181:11.63]And... I, like I've said before, I just, I hope that you can continue to enjoy yourself here.
[181:21.58]If not, let me know.
[181:25.64]If you're not still having fun at some point, let me know, for real.
[181:29.64]Because I, that would be, I wouldn't, I don't want that.
[181:31.98]So...
[181:33.63]Have a great night, everybody.
[181:35.03]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[181:36.47]Again, we're moving the stream that was supposed to be tomorrow to Wednesday.
[181:44.86]I think you could be doing better.
[181:47.38]I will.
[181:47.94]I will.
[181:49.96]Oh my god.
[181:55.02]Jesus Christ.
[181:59.42]First of all, thank you to Tara Alacrita for the $1 streamer fakes disaster on stream and makes billions of dollars pending move Dr. Screwball Jones Just came in with $250 right at the end here 250 fucking dollars somebody gave right here right now biggest exit scam ever Oh God
[182:29.15]Just got to the stream, but I heard what happened after all the years you've made me laugh.
[182:32.49]I hope these bits help.
[182:35.99]Thank you.
[182:43.39]Thank you, Dr. Screwball Jones.
[182:56.18]I'm sitting here trying to think of, like,
[182:59.54]how to think of another way to say thank you.
[183:06.30]But stick around.
[183:10.21]Stick around.
[183:15.03]Thank you so much, everybody.
[183:20.48]Cry for us, you lovely boy.
[183:22.02]No, I, like, no joking around, you know what I mean?
[183:25.90]Like, seriously.
[183:26.68]I mean, obviously, you're joking around, and we joke around here, but no jokes for right now, for here, for me, right this second?
[183:35.75]I... You guys, I'm floored right now.
[183:39.89]I have a fucking water damage in my ceiling that leaks down through my whole house, and all of a sudden, it's like people are gonna give a thousand fucking dollars?
[183:49.18]You guys are so unbelievable.
[183:50.86]Like, I couldn't ask for something more than that.
[183:58.05]That's un-fucking-believable.
[184:03.11]So take care of yourselves, everybody.
[184:04.35]I'll see you on Wednesday.
[184:05.69]Stick around.
[184:08.50]For the future here, though, like I said before I turned the stream off, just don't need...
[184:16.42]I don't want to talk about this anymore.
[184:17.76]I don't want to talk about, like, the damage in this pub, just because I don't... Obviously, the people that aren't here, that might be here in a couple days, I don't want to talk about it, really.
[184:27.47]So, don't worry about any more money.
[184:30.51]Like, I'll be fine.
[184:32.96]What you've given is fucking insanely supportive, and way more than I could ever possibly ask for in the first place.
[184:38.94]So, thank you.
[184:41.64]Much love to you guys.
[184:42.54]I'll see you on Wednesday.
[184:44.10]And I have to take care of this problem, so... Have a good one, guys.
[184:51.32]Take care.
[184:53.18]Much love.
