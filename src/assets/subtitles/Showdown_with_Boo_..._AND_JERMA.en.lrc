[01:29.23]Every time I go too fast, I always get hurt.
[01:31.43]Every time.
[01:31.85]Oh wow, that didn't work.
[01:34.97]I'm fine.
[01:35.97]Oh my god!

[02:13.30]I have places to be.
[02:17.02]No, man.
[02:18.16]Oh, you hit me.
[02:18.74]Oh my god, that did like half my health.
[02:21.28]That took off half my health.
[02:24.78]How is that guy still on his bike?
[02:26.22]We killed each other!
[02:34.09]What happened?
[02:35.95]What just happened?
[02:37.03]I shot a rocket and he headshotted me and then we both killed each other at the same time.
