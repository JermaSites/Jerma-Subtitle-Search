[00:00.09]split well um I mean yeah I could have done that you're right you are you are correct I could have absolutely could have done that
[00:43.95]I can't tell if this is the beginning of the game.
[00:47.69]Or if this is the... I don't know.
[00:49.43]Is this the beginning of the game?
[00:50.39]Does anybody know?
[01:00.90]Where's the... Oh, there it is.
[01:04.70]This is where I left off.
[01:05.82]Alright, good.
[01:08.33]We did a little pivot to Hitman and threw some grenades at people.
[01:12.68]And I went back to the Quiet Man!
[01:18.65]I just backed up into that guy and I heard him.
[01:25.17]Is the audio?
[01:25.67]Yeah, we have to explain to everybody again that the audio is like all fucked up.
[01:33.48]Yeah, see we had two hours of Quiet Man and then two hours of Hitman and then like now two hours of Quiet Man.
[01:48.54]This this sucks you should play hitman again YouTube auto No, no, let's just get through this game.
[02:04.41]I Can't believe I'm still watching this don't you want to see how it ends we need to see how this ends I
[02:17.80]I feel like I was just in like a time warp.
[02:20.52]I just had like a hitman dream for an hour and forty minutes.
[02:30.44]Still says I'm playing hitman.
[02:31.70]Fuck, I get a chance.
[02:32.66]This guy's not even functioning.
[02:40.33]I should get the quiet man's haircut.
[02:44.35]I already had it, it was great.
[02:50.22]God damn it.
[02:51.58]Don't do this to me now.
[02:54.75]Not now.
[02:55.31]Don't do this to me now.
[02:56.45]Don't do this to me now.
[02:59.91]Okay, I fixed him.
[03:06.97]They can't be more than like 30 minutes in this game, right?
[03:09.36]They can't be.
[03:19.38]Golden?
[03:19.84]This did not win a golden joystick award.
[03:21.97]No way.
[03:23.17]It did not.
[03:28.79]It did not.
[03:30.98]It did not.
[03:38.41]What do I have to do?
[03:47.55]Please consider using YouTube autoplay.
[03:54.58]No, I can't.
[03:56.66]Get up!
[04:22.87]18 liked this game alright here's the question do you think the viewer is going to go up or down what do you think your viewers are going to triple well it's been going down
[04:50.56]Hey, well, by the way, Jermania is this weekend, if anyone was curious.
[04:54.08]Hope you have a happy Thanksgiving.
[05:04.46]It still says Hitman 2.
[05:05.58]Oh, hold on.
[05:07.00]Let me change that real quick to the quiet man.
[05:19.59]And then I changed the title.
[05:21.63]Title makes more sense now, too.
[05:32.86]What is this pause screen?
[05:33.78]It's absolute dog shit.
[05:35.86]I have no idea why it's like that.
[05:39.02]And we went back?
[05:39.76]Yeah, we did the... I need to see how this ends.
[05:42.82]We have to be close to the end.
[05:49.11]Blow up this stuff?
[05:49.75]What the fuck is this shit?
[06:06.57]We're almost there.
[06:09.83]There's quite a bit left.
[06:11.07]No, there can't be.
[06:15.29]Don't worry.
[06:34.72]The fact that... Here's the crazy part about this.
[06:36.76]The fact that there's no... Not even any audio besides these muffled punches.
[06:43.51]And they keep doing this overlay.
[06:46.81]Covering the whole screen.
[06:48.25]Superimposing images we've seen a thousand times already.
[06:54.03]Why do you keep showing us this?
[06:56.61]Why do you keep doing that?
[07:11.42]Uh-oh, it's going to explode.
[07:15.92]It's deep.
[07:16.52]You just wouldn't understand.
[07:23.49]Play vacuum cleaner noises.
[07:25.07]Am I about to turn on va- No.
[07:34.37]I already did this.
[07:49.08]How about we just, like, learn how to speak a different language?
[07:51.95]How does that sound?
[07:53.53]Let's get, like, Rosetta Stone.
[08:00.19]Rosetta Stone.
[08:01.47]What language do I want to learn?
[08:02.75]How about... How to speak... How to speak French.
[08:11.74]French.
[08:18.90]A language poll.
[08:19.86]Okay, yeah, you know, that's a great idea.
[08:23.98]Let's see what language you guys want me to learn while we, for the next hour.
[08:35.13]French.
[08:36.87]Latin.
[08:39.43]We've got Chinese.
[08:43.24]Japanese.
[08:44.10]Spanish.
[08:49.68]Um... English... English... Italian... Korean... French... Klingon...
[09:24.86]No, we can't put like... What's the one from Lord of the Rings?
[09:35.53]What's the one from Lord of the Rings?
[09:47.18]This is making me laugh so hard.
[09:57.02]Okay.
[10:00.46]That's good, that's good, that's good.
[10:03.50]No, I'm not putting Dothraki on here.
[10:06.80]Ugh.
[10:07.94]Ugh.
[10:46.89]guys it's coming down to English or elvish 121 to 132.
[11:10.32]People are going to get so confused.
[11:12.40]They're going to come to the stream and they're going to be like, why is he doing this?
[11:16.74]Is there any reason why he's learning a language and playing this shitty game?
[11:23.46]Alright, we got... Alright, you got 60 seconds here.
[11:36.23]I think it's getting closed.
[11:47.65]oh man alright I think that's it yeah it looks like it looks like I'm gonna learn elvish uh we can learn both let's learn elvish and then English
[12:15.04]okay thank you for voting polls close we're going to do elvish in English how to speak elvish oh my god okay basic vowels learn to speak basic elvish alright this one is this video is basic these are vowels
[12:49.14]let's see okay let's give it a try I'm willing to learn okay here we go I thought that in my channel you know I've been using some elvish words and
[13:13.34]Perhaps it's time that I actually tell you what they mean and teach you a little bit so that you understand what I am saying when I do my videos.
[13:22.33]I guess I jumped right in thinking that most people who would find my channel would already know, but if you haven't discovered Elvish language, then I will teach you a little bit.
[13:33.65]Just a short video on the very basics.
[13:37.23]So let's start at the very beginning.
[13:40.87]So what you have to know is that the vowel sounds, sound of a particular word, and that will allow you to be able to pronounce words.
[13:51.14]So for A's, it's always a long A, so it has the sound of ah, ah, ah, ah.
[14:01.06]So it's always ah.
[14:02.42]So whenever you see a word that has A in it, you can sound it out by using ah, ah.
[14:08.16]So A is ah.
[14:10.12]Next vowel we have is E, and it's always a short E. And the word that you can think of to get that sound is L, elephant, or L, L, L. So it's that L, L. And if you don't know what a long and short vowel is, the long makes that long face, ah.
[14:31.53]Short is eh, and you can tell the difference in the way that you position your mouth.
[14:36.76]So eh, eh, so everything is eh and ah so far.
[14:41.96]And then the next vowel is I, and that is a short I. So it has that, so it has ing, ee, ing, ring, ring.
[14:52.39]So I is ing, E is L. Okay, so you're always going to have the I sound like that.
[14:57.43]So if you find a word...
[15:00.22]Like mean, mean.
[15:01.88]Lots of different words actually have I's in them.
[15:05.74]And so you're always going to have that short I sound.
[15:10.50]Then the next vowel is O. And it's a short O. So it's A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A. And then we have U. I'm not the birds.
[15:25.89]I don't have a bird here.
[15:31.51]So it's always like a kind of sound.
[15:44.16]So hopefully that will help in pronouncing some of the Elvish words and names.
[15:52.16]Okay, so let's start out with the very first thing that I always say in my videos, which is
[16:04.47]which means well met my friend sometimes I just say well met friend but if you put that wait I missed the reveal this is the big reveal hold on wait wait wait wait wait I missed it my my
[16:18.80]It's that ah sound, so you always want to end that word with an ah.
[16:23.20]So it's my, my.
[16:25.18]M-E-L.
[16:27.32]But it's that E, so together it's my, my.
[16:31.14]My.
[16:32.50]My.
[16:37.03]So just let it flow from your mouth.
[16:39.56]Okay.
[16:39.88]Very, very simply.
[16:41.10]So that's well met.
[16:41.84]Michaelvonan.
[16:42.20]Remember that the O is that octopus sound and the NIN is that ring.
[16:45.86]So, you know, try it with me.
[16:47.94]Michaelvonan melanin.
[16:50.02]Michaelvonan melanin.
[16:51.72]Very fast.
[16:53.00]Why is the game teaching us Elvish?
[16:54.89]And this is all third age.
[16:58.76]Elvish language.
[16:59.86]This is Sindarin.
[17:01.56]So this is all of the type of pronunciations that you would listen to in the Lord of the Rings.
[17:10.45]So this is all Last Age, Lord of the Rings, all of the trilogy.
[17:14.47]This is the language that they use.
[17:17.30]Because there's a lot of different types of languages.
[17:19.46]Quenya, and there's the Sindarin.
[17:22.70]Can you believe that there's entire languages based on this game?
[17:27.15]Not this game!
[17:28.69]It's easier to research the ones that you find in the movie.
[17:33.23]But it's just really beautiful when you speak it.
[17:35.71]It's really fun when you start to do it.
[17:37.72]So just let that flow really easily.
[17:42.94]The next one, one that I use a lot when I'm just saying hello or hi, just quick reading, is vendu.
[17:50.70]So that's do, do, do, do, do.
[17:53.85]Uniform, that's do, vendu, vendu.
[17:59.29]Very simple.
[18:00.87]The eh, eh is that short E, so vet, do, vendu, vendu.
[18:07.17]And that just means hello.
[18:08.43]The next one that I use sometimes is...
[18:12.84]greetings and this is like that you pronounce the unicorn so so that's that open a like that's greetings
[18:34.78]And then this one is another way that you can greet someone.
[18:39.38]So I greet you.
[18:40.20]So this is another way to greet.
[18:41.36]Oh, my fucking God.
[18:42.30]So the same thing as melon.
[18:45.60]I greet you.
[18:49.69]Okay, so those are very basic ones that you can say when you meet somebody.
[18:53.57]Then I will use these as goodbye.
[18:57.87]So let's start out with the one that she...
[19:11.16]If you write anything on your computer, you need to get Grammarly.
[19:15.25]No, don't get Grammarly.
[19:19.73]Did he actually miss?

[19:49.02]The dog is eating.

[25:13.89]We should give him a tutor.
[25:19.91]Oh, my fucking God.
[25:26.59]I just murdered myself.
[25:33.12]Ugh.
[25:36.16]I didn't learn any English there at all.
[25:38.12]I learned none.
[25:43.38]I did not learn a single thing.
[25:57.93]Oh my lord.

[26:21.76]He's a lazy boy.
[26:26.03]They're talking about me.

[27:14.79]Like... I've been having a lot of fun.
[27:28.54]I need to learn English.
[27:39.57]That's English conversation practice.
[27:43.11]You should open up the phone book.
[27:51.20]I have no idea what this game is about.

[30:22.38]Do you like snow?
[30:23.24]No, I hate it.
[30:24.38]Why?
[30:24.92]Snow is so pretty.
[30:25.86]Yes, but I don't like to drive in it.
[30:27.50]Well, it's beginning to snow.
[30:28.86]And I have to drive to work.
[30:30.42]How far is it to work?
[30:31.48]Six miles.
[30:32.18]Are we going to get much snow?
[30:33.40]About 12 inches, they say.
[30:34.47]Oh, no.
[30:35.27]Driving will be dangerous.
[30:36.29]Please be careful.
[30:37.15]I will.

[30:44.53]We're renting a house on the shore.
[30:45.83]That's wonderful.
[30:46.63]Yes, we love the ocean.
[30:47.83]Do you swim a lot?
[30:48.69]Not very much.
[30:49.51]Then why are you going to the shore?
[30:50.69]Because we all bought new swimsuits.
[30:53.59]They're still talking.
[30:55.37]When is your vacation?
[30:56.25]It starts next week.

[31:00.02]Yes, we love the ocean.
[31:01.32]Do you swim a lot?
[31:02.86]Not very much.
[31:03.64]Then why are you going to the shore?
[31:04.86]This is the way the game is meant to be played.
[31:09.24]Flash the Nvidia logo.
[31:12.50]It's snowing.
[31:13.18]But it's snowing.
[31:13.74]But what?

[31:16.98]How do you get there?
[31:17.58]I drive.
[31:17.96]Can I borrow your car?
[31:26.14]What a strange way the two robots talk to each other.
[31:36.73]Looks like it was dead.

[34:36.65]Afraid of flying.
[34:41.33]Where is your meeting?
[34:45.56]In Dallas, Texas.
[34:47.38]How are you going?
[34:48.74]By plane.
[34:49.90]Do you like to fly?
[34:51.56]Sure.
[34:52.32]It's fast and comfortable.
[34:55.40]I'm afraid of flying.
[35:00.93]Silly.
[35:01.67]Flying is very safe.
[35:05.67]Maybe, but I don't feel safe in a plane.
[35:08.69]I understand.
[35:12.59]A lot of people feel that way.
[35:19.14]Afraid of flying.
[35:22.68]Where is your meeting?
[35:24.86]In Dallas, Texas.
[35:27.09]How are you going?
[35:28.05]He's lost his fucking mind.
[35:30.93]Do you like to fly?
[35:34.65]Sure.
[35:35.43]It's fast and comfortable.
[35:40.52]I'm afraid of flying.
[35:43.24]That's silly.
[35:44.92]Flying is very safe.
[35:49.18]Maybe, but I don't feel safe in a plane.
[35:52.20]I understand.
[35:54.32]A lot of people feel that way.
[35:58.73]I can't control it anymore.
[35:59.57]A plane reservation.
[36:02.13]Okay.
[36:03.45]We gotta get off the plane.
[36:04.65]No.
[36:09.25]No.
[36:40.13]Secret sponsor.
[36:41.23]He's sponsored, not me.
[36:45.15]How long is this cutscene?
[36:46.28]I have no idea.
[36:49.96]I know.
[36:50.76]That's why I need a loan.
[36:56.63]A car loan So dad just gonna watch me fight is that what's gonna happen A car loan is a boot to the head

[38:00.87]Hold on, I gotta, hold on a second.
[38:20.88]This is important.
[38:45.37]I'm ready.
[38:58.02]I'm ready for the next cutscene.
[39:09.63]Is that it?
[39:10.31]It's like the chef is the only guy left.
[39:17.37]Oh, come on.
[39:17.97]Why are you like the hardest guy in the game?
[39:19.45]Alright, knock him out.

[39:34.45]No, we're not.
[39:36.51]It's still going.
[39:46.64]I'm so ready for the next cutscene.
[39:48.10]I hope there's like three people involved.
[39:49.58]Please tell me there's five people in this cutscene.
[40:35.90]Yeah.
[40:36.60]Yeah.
[41:05.32]Why is there a video of 12 hours of baby sounds?
[41:42.06]Come on!
[41:51.45]Washing machine noises?
[41:52.73]Into the dryer?
[42:40.55]That was it.
[42:44.72]Leave it on?
[42:46.20]That's gonna hurt my brain.
[43:03.77]That guy's got a bat.
[43:19.10]This needs to be very... I'm not turning these up very loud.
[43:23.04]No way.
[43:40.95]I feel like I'm stuck somewhere.
[43:42.33]Like, I'm stuck right now.
[43:43.93]Not in the game, just in life.
[43:46.45]I'm in this washing machine, and I don't like it.
[43:48.89]I don't want to be in the washing machine anymore.
[43:50.09]Get me out of here.
[43:59.24]Put in Nickelodeon sound effects?
[44:00.70]Okay.
[44:01.48]I like that better.
[44:11.94]Alright, Nickelodeon sound effects.
[44:24.42]Okay, let's see.
[44:26.92]No, that's not it.
[44:50.02]Nice lag.

[44:58.75]Oh my god.
[45:11.01]Ed, Ed and Eddie.
[45:12.39]Ed, Ed and Eddie.
[45:18.24]The Ed, Ed and Eddie theme song?
[45:22.56]Ask your parents
[46:10.73]What's happening?
[46:11.21]What's playing next?
[46:15.23]No, I don't want to play full episodes of Courage the Cowardly Dog.
[46:18.36]I'm sorry, that's not going to happen.
[46:21.26]I'm not going to play an episode of Ed, Edd, and Eddy in the background, guys.
[46:35.80]He's getting away!
[46:36.72]I'm not doing that shit.
[46:40.69]Do it, Kyle!
[46:41.39]No!
[46:41.61]What, you want me to play copyrighted material?
[46:45.63]Alright, I...
[47:10.72]Ren and Stimpy?
[47:12.82]Oh my god.
[47:15.16]Somebody said this.
[47:15.95]This would fit pretty well.
[47:49.18]Is this 2011?
[47:49.72]I'm gonna lose again.
[48:28.55]No, the stream is not getting that derailed.
[48:31.38]We're derailing.
[48:36.75]I mean, I'll do that.
[48:37.91]That's funny.
[49:04.99]That's it this does not That was it it was one alright, I'll get up this is the last part of the game Yeah, we are very closely Walking the line of this is this stream is a shitpost We're getting there very quickly It's happening
[49:37.68]This is getting real close.
[49:40.12]It already is.
[49:40.82]I... I know, that's why I got... I gotta put the foot down somewhere.
[49:56.59]Get away from me!
[49:59.43]These guys, the way that they swing...
[50:05.62]Ugh!
[50:06.78]That guy just flew across the whole entire map.
[50:11.82]We'll play Batman.
[50:12.62]No we won't.
[50:13.18]We're not gonna play Batman.
[50:14.64]We're almost out of this.

[50:46.30]Not yet.
[50:46.70]Just play audio from another stream I did.
[51:03.88]Uh...
[51:05.53]This is painful without memes.
[51:08.83]Well, let me just get through this place.
[51:13.97]Oh my god, there's another one.
[51:30.64]I'm not playing somebody's latest video.
[51:36.85]Let me just get out of this.
[51:39.81]Okay.
[51:40.72]Play my latest video in the background.
[51:44.36]My latest video is a Spider-Man update video from two years ago.
[51:53.08]Oh, I'm overstimulated right now.
[51:56.33]Anybody else overstimulated?
[52:13.24]I feel like I'm gonna have to take a bath after this stream.
[52:18.82]I'm gonna put, like, Epsom salt.
[52:21.70]And coconut oil.
[52:22.62]And I'm just gonna soak.
[52:27.92]I need recovery after tonight.
[52:30.24]I have been every emotion.
[52:33.89]You know what I mean?
[52:34.31]This has been a wild fucking stream.
[52:36.57]I've been every single emotion.
[52:40.58]I was sad.
[52:42.24]I was scared.
[52:43.51]I was angry.
[52:44.71]It was joy.
[52:46.65]Every emotion has been touched.
[52:55.09]Stream the bath.
[53:08.66]Stream the bath.
[53:11.83]I'm gonna get banned if I stream me in a bathtub.
[53:23.53]Just wear clothes.
[53:24.93]Wear a swimsuit.
[53:34.84]Just keep all of my clothes on.
[53:37.28]I can't.
[53:37.74]I can't do it.
[53:39.36]I can't risk it.
[53:46.81]That one random scenario.
[53:53.57]You did it already.
[53:54.44]Yeah, but that was like a video.
[54:09.37]I talked to Mr. Twitch.
[54:10.55]He said it was fine.
[54:17.43]I regret wanting this game to come back.
[54:20.39]Well... Oh, just in case you're curious, I cannot refund this game.
[54:40.83]It's been like three hours.
[54:52.29]Is he supposed to do something, or... Alright, give it to me straight here.
[55:04.71]Give it to me real.
[55:06.17]What, um... How much is left in the game?
[55:10.11]For real, and no jokey answers.
[55:12.17]How much is actually left in this game?
[55:20.49]I wanna know for real.
[55:26.04]30 minutes.
[55:27.88]30 to 45 minutes?
[55:28.60]Alright, we can do it.
[55:31.40]We can do it.
[55:36.09]What the hell are you doing down here, Dad?
[55:38.57]Maybe 20, 30?
[55:39.77]We can do it.
[55:42.47]Here's the second to last boss.
[55:50.04]One guy.
[55:50.46]No, there's no way.
[55:51.86]There was a huge reveal that these people that I didn't care about in the beginning are people that I still don't care about in the end.
[55:58.23]And they double-crossed me for somehow through the beginning of the game.
[56:01.35]I don't remember what they double-crossed me on until they did it, though.
[56:04.49]Somebody was talking like baby talk.
[56:07.77]It was an English tutorial.
[56:09.69]That's all I remember.
[56:15.49]Because this is one of the main characters here.
[56:24.03]Alright, come on.
[56:24.63]You can... It's just two drunk guys fighting.
[56:46.15]Why did I go through him?
[56:50.75]Am I even connecting shots on this guy?
[56:53.84]I don't think I am.
[56:58.08]I'm punching him and it's hurting me.
[57:03.33]And there actually is no sound.
[57:05.27]Okay, there we go.
[57:09.88]I mean, that's a great idea.
[57:24.76]Hey, Google, show me how to phone.
[57:28.09]Can be dangerous, buddy.
[57:29.97]Nothing.
[57:38.88]His brother, Kane.
[57:40.44]I mean, you can throw all the history out the window.
[57:43.54]This is gonna be different.
[57:45.80]This is gonna be unique.
[57:47.65]This is gonna be scary.
[57:49.41]Kane, try it.
[57:55.37]Here he is!
[57:57.01]It worked.
[57:58.12]I don't think this match is officially underway.
[58:01.38]I never heard the bell ring.
[58:02.78]They never got the door locked in Kane.
[58:25.01]Why did I just lose that quickly?
[58:31.82]This is like playing a game on a school night and having the sound muted so your parents don't know you're still up.
[58:35.91]Yes.
[58:37.55]Okay, now the door is locked.
[58:43.93]Finally back into the cell.
[58:50.13]And it's Kane who goes on the offense early.
[58:52.89]And perhaps this is no accident.
[58:56.49]Understanding what the Undertaker's capable of with maneuvers like that.
[58:59.93]20 years of destruction for the Undertaker.
[59:06.79]Looking to continue it tonight.
[59:08.43]They are locking in.
[59:11.49]Oh, the door is locked.
[59:12.57]The match just started.
[59:13.93]Oh, come on.
[59:14.59]No.
[59:14.71]20 years of destruction.
[59:43.43]Vintage Undertaker
[60:05.67]Again, a cover, shoulders down, and a kick out.
[60:08.96]Quick backstory, Paul Bearer had an affair with a woman in the bowels of the funeral home.
[60:12.42]Wait, what?
[60:15.52]Oh, right, Kane.
[60:19.06]Undertaker knocked down to his knees after that punch.
[60:23.66]It was 1991.
[60:24.25]Oh, and look at Kane now with the chair.
[60:27.99]Chair I don't have a chair don't lose here Humanity was revealed to be alive
[60:48.90]A demon, a monster, admittedly so.
[60:52.02]Kane has lived in his bigger, more celebrated brother's shadow for years.
[60:55.33]That's what this is all about.
[60:56.95]Paul Bearer, the father of destruction, looking on.
[61:03.03]Please!
[61:05.91]Got together with the Undertaker in 1991, and they've had their issues over the years, but it seems the Undertaker always gravitates back to Paul Bearer.
[61:18.73]Where the fuck am I?
[61:20.41]The world heavyweight champion came in the early going
[61:42.09]Which one is the Undertaker?
[62:06.34]You can hear that cage rattling.
[62:08.54]He is now 20 feet high and 5 tons.
[62:11.02]And to put this in perspective, this is the 11th time Undertaker has participated in this matchup.
[62:18.33]The closest individual to him, Triple H, has been involved in big LMS cell matches.
[62:25.29]He broke into the cell.
[62:26.23]He wins.
[62:26.63]Wait, hold on.
[62:30.58]Hey, does anyone have a charger?
[62:32.44]We're dying.
[62:33.20]There's some down here.
[62:36.11]I can't take it anymore.
[62:42.38]Hey, does anyone have a charger?
[63:12.14]Oh my god.
[63:43.10]No, no.
[63:43.78]No, no.
[63:44.26]No, no.
[64:15.42]What?
[64:55.82]Fucking come on.
[65:00.52]Come on.
[65:27.97]Hey.
[65:29.03]Hey.
[65:52.37]No, we're going to wait for...
[66:21.67]What is even going on?
[66:30.57]Keep it going?
[66:31.41]No, no, this is what happened!
[67:27.27]This whole stream is a shitpost.
[67:29.31]It just, it is.
[67:30.86]I've come to terms with that.
[67:37.40]It just has been the whole time.
[67:39.20]It has not stopped for about five hours.
[68:01.43]Embracing it.
[68:02.23]You have to embrace it.
[68:04.27]Hey, can we get some English lessons?
[68:14.51]I'm not sure.
[68:15.23]Okay.
[68:32.22]Hi, this is Gabe Newell.
[68:39.18]Hi, this is Gabe Newell.
[68:48.47]Damn it.
[68:56.10]That's Gabe.
[68:58.42]Hi, this is Gabe Newell.

[69:24.29]I'm done.
[69:25.43]I'm done with this one.
[69:26.93]I'm done with this one.
[69:29.84]Get out.
[69:35.85]Mother of God.
[70:10.85]The following improved on perfection.
[70:13.06]I think we've made it even more perfect.
[70:14.74]Come on.
[70:16.66]Joe, this is the express ready, set, go.
[70:20.88]Well, Kathy, this... This is beautiful.
[70:32.65]And it is ready.
[70:40.98]Look what we've done.
[70:42.86]Look what we've done.
[70:52.13]So, I am the bad guy.
[70:54.53]Or not.
[70:55.27]No, I'm not.
[70:57.27]He's the Birdman, so I have to beat the whole game.
[71:06.65]That was a huge boot.
[71:08.15]Where was that the whole game?
[71:10.56]I'm trapped here.
[71:20.37]Only five more hours.
[71:21.85]No, this game is over in ten minutes, probably.
[71:34.75]I'm in slow motion.
[71:36.67]Get out of that slow motion, man.
[71:37.87]Come on.
[71:44.24]Really?
[71:46.22]Oh, I'm... Remember to punch the guy in the balls.
[71:57.99]You can't do that.
[72:08.25]Did I make this?
[72:11.40]You know what I mean?
[72:17.39]No, you did.
[72:18.11]Yeah, I did.
[72:18.99]Okay, you did.
[72:20.15]I just was checking.
[72:28.06]I forgot.
[72:28.68]I didn't know if I did or not.
[72:38.69]I want like a countdown timer for when the game is over.
[72:47.97]So, I don't... What the fuck am I doing?
[72:50.33]That was a nice double kick.
[73:01.32]No, here comes another five people.
[73:15.14]I just asked chat to count.
[73:16.76]Oh god, that was a mistake.
[73:17.84]I'm so sorry.
[73:23.56]I can't lose here, though.
[73:24.62]I don't want to do this again.
[73:25.38]They're still coming in here.
[73:34.36]I mean, why... Why make... It's just the same... It's the same combo every time, too.
[73:45.99]every single time.
[73:52.15]Nobody looked at it and said, hey, maybe we shouldn't just have the same room and the same combo.
[74:00.94]You took out that center divider, so now you have 25% more cooking area.
[74:08.94]So you can cook a lot of different things in here.
[74:10.41]Exactly right.
[74:11.03]Like, how about pizza?
[74:16.62]It makes the best pizza I've ever had.
[74:18.50]Now this is my almost instant pizza dough.
[74:27.92]And the...
[74:29.19]Greasy.
[74:58.11]Here's the last boss fight.
[75:05.93]I need something perfect.
[75:06.67]I need something for this.
[75:13.43]I need something perfect for this.
[75:31.41]Think they think of Gwen's theme.
[75:38.25]Lord of Cinder.
[76:03.65]Come on, Gwen!
[76:05.49]Parry him!
[76:06.45]I gotta parry him, you're right.
[76:12.04]Good parry.
[76:23.56]That was a parry!
[76:24.35]I parried him!
[76:25.31]Oh my god.
[76:26.51]I'm gonna lose to Gwyn.
[76:27.25]Why would you, like, taunt me there?
[76:37.01]I lost.
[76:53.07]What you're about to hear is encouragement and praise with cheering applause just for you.
[77:01.64]Acknowledging you for a variety of reasons.
[77:06.94]If there's a situation that does not apply to you, just listen and see how you feel.
[77:16.85]So sit back, get ready.
[77:21.35]Here it comes.
[77:28.96]We want to thank you for all your hard work.
[77:37.20]You're the one who steps up and gets things done around here.
[77:43.90]You keep your word, you deliver what you promise, and then you go the extra mile.
[77:53.89]You're doing a great job!
[77:56.27]A great job!
[78:02.05]If anyone asks, we'll tell them.
[78:05.01]A great job!
[78:06.18]Come on, Quinn.
[78:37.50]Doing a great job, I am!
[78:38.84]I need more, I need more!
[78:46.27]I'm gonna lose it if I don't get cheered, come on!
[78:50.25]Got it!
[79:08.12]You're probably wondering why we have asked you here today.
[79:13.96]We want to tell you that we have faith in you.
[79:17.08]And we know you can do it.
[79:22.65]We know you've got everything it takes to accomplish whatever your heart desires.
[79:30.80]That dream you're going for.
[79:32.74]That career you want.
[79:34.66]That recognition you're seeking.
[79:37.72]It is yours.
[79:43.04]Just listen.
[79:44.36]Everyone agrees.
[79:48.95]A great job.
[79:51.53]Here it comes.
[79:53.33]We're on your side.
[79:55.55]We're here for you.
[79:57.55]We believe in you.
[80:01.15]We believe in you.
[80:02.67]We believe in you.
[80:13.97]That seriously is one of the most unbelievably funny DVD, CDs that was sold on an infomercial.
[80:24.62]Cheers to you is real.
[80:26.86]This is not a joke.
[80:28.48]That's not just some YouTuber making a joke.
[80:31.62]That was an infomercial.
[80:32.40]You bought that and plugged it in and put it in and listened to it.
[80:40.92]I can't believe it.
[80:43.62]I wish I had bought it a long time ago.
[80:48.37]And you had one?
[80:49.35]No, no, I just remember watching the infomercial.
[80:54.27]People used to be unironically encouraged by it.
[80:56.63]Well, good, because I hope they were doing a great job.
[81:09.97]We believe in you.
[81:13.73]What the hell?
[81:17.28]Why am I like a supernatural now?
[81:24.52]Are you kidding me?
[81:29.78]What?
[81:56.91]Now get 20% off clothing and outerwear at L.L.Bean.
[82:00.14]Find gifts with hundreds of five-star reviews, like our sweater fleece or our 850 down jackets.
[82:05.08]Both are customer favorites.
[82:06.02]Don't listen to this.
[82:07.88]Make it an L.L.Bean holiday and get 20% off clothing and outerwear.
[82:11.38]Okay!
[82:20.09]Oh, wait.
[82:22.31]Oh, wait.
[82:24.21]Start it over.
[82:24.79]Start it over.
[82:25.33]Start it over.
[82:25.83]Wait, wait.
[82:49.26]Bring it on.
[83:39.66]Nobody can beat Sans, he's the hardest boss in the game.
[84:00.60]What the fuck was that?
[84:26.37]The timing... I need a space!
[84:54.58]Throw up!
[85:25.52]Why is this the coolest part of the whole game?
[85:57.94]There's so much we're doing.
[86:05.81]Jeremy confirmed for 10-year-old little cousin.
[86:13.83]This was a request.
[86:15.31]This was a special request.
[86:20.73]Alright, let's see how...
[86:59.70]The Undertaker!
[87:02.91]He will destroy you!
[87:07.93]No man can match his speed!
[87:13.32]Oh, yes!
[87:29.88]Destroy him!
[87:31.32]Give him the tombstone!
[88:12.37]How many guys are there?
[88:13.59]When does this end?
[88:15.71]How do you get this to stop?
[88:23.43]Does this never end?
[88:44.57]Alright, hold on.
[88:45.05]Wait, wait, wait.
[88:46.65]I have to get the girl?
[88:55.46]Okay, uh... What?
[89:03.25]What the fuck is going on?
[89:11.03]Did the time just rewind?
[89:17.07]I don't have... I don't... Why did that happen?
[89:25.43]Didn't I just... I just did this?
[89:34.86]Okay.
[89:36.61]He wants to rematch the Undertaker.
[89:44.31]Why would you want to fight me like this?
[89:51.81]I don't think I'd want to fight this guy.
[89:59.10]He's gonna break the streak.
[90:09.22]Need music, need music.
[90:12.33]Alright, sorry.
[90:12.69]Hold on.
[90:13.01]Let me schedule in my shitpost stream.
[90:15.09]Let me just get it scheduled for you guys.
[90:16.83]Yeah, so today's the Wednesday night.
[90:22.10]You know, once every two or three months.
[90:39.57]Is this in my imagination?
[90:40.79]Do I just think I'm like a superhero or am I?
[90:43.22]Am I holding him over the edge?
[91:05.71]Give us the reveal
[91:43.55]Oh no, what happened to dad?
[91:51.86]Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[92:09.67]Uh...
[92:37.21]Yo, come on!
[92:40.07]No, you don't want to reveal Jigsaw!
[92:42.41]That's not his face.
[92:43.81]You're kissing a mask.
[93:19.97]I've lost control of the stream.
[93:23.67]I actually lost it probably three hours ago, but you know who's counting?
[93:30.12]He's nice, but he's lazy.
[93:33.58]Did I ever have control?
[93:34.58]I'm not sure.
[93:35.04]I don't think I did.
[93:45.57]We already saw him without the mask.
[93:46.93]This reveal doesn't make any sense.
[93:49.26]Is it like a twin?
[93:51.02]It's a twin situation, right?
[93:53.52]It's twin brothers.
[93:57.12]One of them was evil.
[93:58.82]And wore a mask.
[93:59.52]And the other one was putting the mask on to try to... It's twin brothers.
[94:05.68]See, watch.
[94:06.06]Here comes the twin.
[94:07.16]I called it.
[94:08.30]I fucking win.
[94:09.70]I win.
[94:10.84]I win.
[94:12.88]Here comes the twin brother.
[94:28.40]No, it's a dad.
[94:30.78]Why does everybody have this mask?
[94:36.32]I don't... Is this like The Mask with Jim Carrey?
[94:40.83]This thing just makes you go crazy?
[94:42.73]It brings out the worst or the most mischievous of people?
[94:45.85]I don't understand.
[94:48.12]Why wear it?
[95:03.78]Do I have to play as... Did you really just do?
[95:17.37]Like the rock?
[95:29.98]What the rock?
[95:57.90]Give him the people's elbow, I'll try.
[96:01.24]He's the rock, I'm not the rock.
[96:12.76]Alright, I got it.
[96:13.28]I got the people's elbow.
[96:19.13]Oh, dad, you suck.
[96:25.05]Ooh, that was a nice slide.
[96:42.45]Does anyone want to watch all the dialog of the game at like x20 speed?
[96:50.46]So we can just figure out what happened?
[97:00.13]Just like... I'm sure we can figure out what happened.
[97:01.95]I don't think it's even possible.
[97:10.23]Got it with a dropkick, yeah.
[97:11.99]That was pretty good.
[97:13.89]Ooh, we're in the Hell in a Cell right here.
[97:21.84]Oh, right up against the cage!
[97:28.88]New Game Plus has dialog.
[97:32.08]Yeah, but why would you want to play through this whole thing again?
[97:36.89]Like, the video game itself is just awful, right?
[97:42.00]If the story was good, you don't want to play through this again.
[97:49.50]If the game was a little bit more fun, maybe.
[97:52.19]But, okay, you could have a really interesting story.
[97:54.41]Well, you have to play through the whole game and then play through it again to be able to hear everything.
[97:58.03]But, like, the fighting has just been the same two combos.
[98:07.67]Why are we doing, like, the Dragon Ball Z we both fought for five minutes?
[98:10.92]Now we're gonna have a dialog sequence.
[98:13.34]They really are doing that.
[98:19.22]That's like a Smash Bros.
[98:20.34]trailer.
[98:20.74]What the hell was that?
[98:21.60]Ooh, the double knockout.
[98:35.17]The double knockout.
[98:47.15]Who is this?
[98:48.47]They're not, she's not going to come over and put the mask on, right?
[98:53.25]Is that like a, who is this?
[98:54.63]Is that the girl that was just standing there?
[99:02.63]If she puts the mask on and I have to fight this girl.
[99:19.40]She's gonna be naked?
[99:23.13]Don't be naked.
[99:23.77]Don't go all the way here and be naked or something.
[99:26.33]Don't do that.
[99:53.87]I'm going to do my best.
[99:54.43]I'm going to do my best to lip sync it.
[99:57.03]To the lip match.
[100:00.63]When the right words fail to find the light of day.
[100:31.64]No, you're ruining my immersion.
[100:33.55]I don't want to hear it.
[100:34.27]I've been so used to not hearing it.
[100:35.37]I don't want to hear it.
[100:52.83]We're here for the ending credits.
[100:54.37]We have to see it.
[100:55.13]Sing it.
[101:22.84]Stargazer, storm chaser Bought for dust, sold for gold
[101:45.56]This is one of those movies that you go see with a group of people.
[101:50.46]And you spend the money on it.
[101:52.56]And then the car ride, you walk out, you know, the movie ends.
[101:56.83]Okay, everyone gets up.
[101:59.01]Silent on the way out.
[102:01.37]You get in the car, doors close, close, close, close.
[102:03.07]There's like four of you.
[102:05.60]Nobody talks.
[102:06.76]It's dead silent.
[102:09.06]And finally somebody's just like, So what's the...
[102:13.97]Was the son the bad guy?
[102:15.53]Or was the mom... And everyone's just like, I don't know, man.
[102:19.53]That was... Whatever.
[102:23.24]Like, nobody has any fucking idea.
[102:28.92]It's quiet for like 15 to 20 minutes.
[102:30.78]Until somebody decides to bring it up.
[102:32.88]Because you all paid for it.
[102:37.24]And you spent time there, you know what I mean?
[102:39.48]It was like a two or three hour movie.
[102:41.72]Nobody wants to admit that that was a bad idea.
[102:45.38]But wow, we all just wasted our evening.
[102:48.72]No, nobody... So, let me get this straight.
[102:52.26]Lisa...
[103:11.17]Dude, make- get rid of the whole beginning part, and give me the- give me like the Electric Birdman stuff.
[103:20.01]With all those cool moves.
[103:36.30]Of us two, two twins.
[103:37.90]It's about twins.
[103:39.24]It takes to make the break.
[103:43.23]To show the twins on screen.
[104:03.51]Don't even give me this bullshit this this over 3,000 people here 40 of you at least Are like actually kind of like this you're gonna add this to your playlist you when you're working on it
[104:41.04]Yes, he will.
[104:45.37]Not a bad song, see?
[104:48.01]What's it called in the time that it takes to show the twins on screen?
[104:51.06]Is that what it's called?
[105:13.32]You always stay for the after Infinity War credits.
[105:19.86]Push her off and this would be of two letter grades higher.
[105:23.91]Oh, well here comes another person to put on the bird mask.
[105:30.05]Is it Dad again?
[105:30.85]It's Dad again.
[105:31.47]Dad's back.
[105:34.67]Dad got up and... You've been family for years!
[105:43.58]nothing's ever come between us until tonight until her I want the main character to have a really really absurd voice is also what's happening to me like shut up idiot you're blinded by grief me
[106:10.94]By ambition.
[106:11.98]Why does it sound like compressed audio?
[106:20.46]Yeah.
[106:21.32]Woo!
[106:22.06]Homeroom 201!
[106:38.85]It is the greatest performance of my career.
[106:43.41]The night I was kidnapped.
[106:48.27]In the time that it takes You put songs of the world In the time that it takes
[107:21.67]1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[107:23.35]10, 20, 23, 24.
[107:24.59]Uh, 50, 49 cents.
[107:25.79]40, nope, 40, yeah, 49 cents, got it.
[107:31.15]Don't you just fucking hate the rumble feature on controllers?
[107:38.46]I wish they would just not do it anymore.
[107:47.95]What the hell?
[107:48.29]Am I supposed to press a button?
[107:55.66]Most people would have hung up by then.
[108:02.52]Lala.
[108:08.68]Let the machine go.
[108:09.54]I can't sing anymore.
[108:11.39]No one hears me.
[108:14.53]Quiet man answer Hey, what's going everybody?
[108:19.30]It's uh
[108:42.86]It's Bob from the dev team.
[108:44.28]I'm gonna answer your questions here as the game plays again.
[108:49.10]I'm going to kidnap you.
[108:50.31]So we decided to put the game in reverse.
[108:52.49]Have you seen Memento?
[108:54.27]That goes in reverse too.
[108:55.49]Spoiler, I mean, it's a great movie.
[109:17.92]How do I turn it on?
[109:27.86]Didn't say it was in the options?
[109:49.61]Yeah, that really is a 2006 DVD menu.
[109:56.10]In the time!
[110:01.76]I just wanna see, I'm curious.
[110:21.76]Gotta change the stream name.
[110:24.24]Instead of the quiet man.
[110:26.96]The I can hear you now man.
[110:28.68]The audible man.
[110:36.25]Loud man.
[110:46.30]The man.
[110:47.24]Just the man.
[110:49.22]A man.
[110:52.28]A man in the world.
[110:59.59]Let's see what I say here.
[111:02.35]Didn't we hear this guy?
[111:03.35]This game makes no sense.
[111:05.93]This guy, we heard him in the beginning.
[111:07.99]We heard this shit before.
[111:10.35]He talks.
[111:15.16]Why did halfway through the game we couldn't hear anymore?
[111:23.67]See Why were we able to hear him do that but then 30 40 minutes later, it's just muffled sounds Alright, where's the scene that we need context, you know, I mean I
[111:52.39]Oh, I can't.
[111:53.19]I can't just skip.
[111:58.90]All of them.
[112:00.08]This is no sound, though.
[112:05.58]Alright.
[112:06.28]Let's just press.
[112:06.90]Let's get it over with.
[112:11.94]Done.
[112:16.06]Yeah, I couldn't use the top one.
[112:21.60]Separate progress, yeah.
[112:25.28]Okay, hold on.
[112:29.53]Too late for a refund?
[112:30.97]Yeah, that's alright.
[112:32.07]I had a good time.
[112:33.59]Listening to music and putting fucking weird sound effects over my stream.
[112:40.47]We were all just sitting in a room and I was just pressing buttons and loud sounds and music was coming up.
[112:49.76]I may as well just had a black screen.
[112:55.17]You know, it gets to a point when you start to play the Ed, Edd n Eddy theme song and then a portion of an entire episode.
[113:04.75]Yeah, you've lost control completely and the stream's off the rails.
[113:11.96]Might as well just keep the screen here.
[113:21.91]That was a weird stream.
[113:24.09]We started on this and then it got voted off the island.
[113:27.63]I got angry at my computer.
[113:31.94]I blew up a guy in Hitman and then we went back and finished.
[113:36.54]That was very odd.
[113:45.26]But I am not streaming tomorrow.
[113:48.40]It's Thanksgiving tomorrow.
[113:49.30]Happy Thanksgiving to all of you.
[113:52.13]The next time you see me will be either Friday or Saturday.
[113:57.00]Jermania 2018 is scheduled for hopefully Sunday.
[114:01.38]So I obviously want to give myself a little bit more time to work on it.
[114:05.41]So nothing tomorrow and maybe nothing on Friday because I really want to put time into the wrestling thing.
[114:15.34]But we'll see.
[114:16.16]You might see me again before Saturday.
[114:18.58]But if not, we're going to go Saturday and Sunday.
[114:20.78]Sunday being hopefully the, you know, that game.
[114:24.88]Am I going to stream more Red Dead?
[114:30.67]Maybe.
[114:31.09]Maybe that's what we'll do on Friday or Saturday.
[114:34.75]Because I really am getting kind of an itch to play it again.
[114:39.45]But there you go.
[114:39.93]Thanks for sticking around.
[114:42.35]I know people were coming and going during this nightmare stream.
[114:47.45]That's the best way I can put it.
[114:48.51]It was kind of just like a bunch of dreams mashed together.
[114:55.17]But let's get to the bits and then the credits.
[115:00.06]Take care.
[115:01.06]Hope you had fun.
[115:02.24]I mean, weirdly enough, I had fun pretty much the entire stream.
[115:05.82]I thought that was going to be like a disaster.
[115:08.91]No, that was a... I had a lot of fun.
[115:11.59]That was great.
[115:20.65]Quiet man in Jermania.
[115:25.21]Yeah, probably.
[115:28.77]I don't see why not.
[115:29.35]I'm going to have to mute the stream when he comes out.
[115:39.66]But anyways, let's go back a few hours here to just about four hours ago.
[115:52.09]Let's go, let's see what I got.
[115:53.45]There we go.
[115:57.53]Where is it?
[115:58.17]That's my dashboard.
[116:02.56]Okay.
[116:04.96]So thank you to ExtraCheesy for the $1.45 donation.
[116:09.30]Hey Jermbo, you finally managed to stream some dead space without it sucking completely.
[116:14.36]Oh damn, man.
[116:17.48]I only just recently figured out how to keep it from being all stuttery.
[116:20.28]I'm going to celebrate by giving you money.
[116:22.03]Thank you, ExtraCheesy.
[116:24.11]It's a process, as you saw during this stream.
[116:27.93]Sometimes computer problems and graphics and drivers and CPU.
[116:32.81]I have no idea what was going on with Hitman.
[116:36.24]But it just happens.
[116:37.86]And you just kind of have to try to figure it out on the fly, or... It's part of the gig.
[116:47.45]So, I wish you luck.
[116:49.65]And thanks for the $1.45, dude.
[116:53.63]Also, thank you to Timmy Tim.
[116:56.07]Timmy Tim Tam for the $1.
[116:57.31]Are you going to go through... Are you going through a Garfield phase again?
[117:00.61]It's okay if you are.
[117:01.33]We support you.
[117:03.23]A Garfield phase.
[117:06.99]What do you mean?
[117:12.75]How do you... Garfield phase?
[117:14.87]Oh, Lasagna.
[117:15.51]That's right.
[117:16.08]The stream title was Lasagna.
[117:20.16]No, there was a whole thing about... This was like three different streams.
[117:24.90]I feel like I streamed that.
[117:26.50]I feel like that was a conversation we had yesterday.
[117:29.47]This was really three different streams.
[117:32.87]Just mashed together in about five and a half hours.
[117:49.24]Sorry for confusing people, but it's all good.
[117:54.04]Thank you, by the way, speaking of lasagna and Garfield.
[117:56.16]Thank you, Garfield, the Monday Killer, for the $1.
[117:59.96]Jerma, I'm stuck in Feline Penitentiary.
[118:02.22]They got me.
[118:02.76]Now I'm in prison with you as well.
[118:04.51]I'm not in prison.
[118:05.27]What are we talking about?
[118:07.40]Well, not you physically.
[118:08.88]They just threw my phone in it as well, and they thought it was you, since that's what I used to show them on the stream.
[118:15.24]These guys hated my Garfagraphs enough to keep me in prison.
[118:18.42]So, Jerma, what's the game plan?
[118:19.28]How are you going to break me out of here?
[118:21.84]Cyborg, friend, helicopter?
[118:24.10]How is Garfield going to get out of this one?
[118:25.70]Stay tuned for the next exciting episode.
[118:30.01]I ain't posting you, Bailman.
[118:35.47]I would encourage no one else to as well.
[118:43.30]asshole what no I I'm talking about like the joke comedy cartoon land not like real life we're talking about joke comedy cartoon universe betrayal is that a joke
[119:10.38]Nothing is funny about putting cats in prison.
[119:13.52]Yeah, but it's a comedy prison.
[119:15.12]It's a cartoon prison.
[119:19.56]If Garfield was actually in there, all he would have to do is plug his ears and blow out as hard as he could and steam would come out of his nose and melt the bars and he would walk out.
[119:27.80]It's the cartoon comedy land.
[119:29.18]You can do whatever you want.
[119:30.57]He'll find a way out.
[119:36.73]Well, thank you, Garfield.
[119:38.61]Appreciate it.
[119:40.14]Dr. Clay, thanks for the one dollar.
[119:41.34]Jeremiah, I'm ready for phase one of busting out Garfield.
[119:45.32]I'm reporting to you that we have two guards at the entrance and four at the desk.
[119:48.80]If we want to get Garfield, we've got to go quick.
[119:50.52]Awaiting orders.
[119:52.50]Go to lunch.
[119:55.14]And then go home.
[119:59.72]Thank you, Violet Guy, for the five dollars.
[120:06.17]Save me some lasagna.
[120:07.21]I will.
[120:08.41]I'll save you lasagna.
[120:09.35]Don't worry.
[120:09.75]You can get some.
[120:16.11]But thank you, Pilot Guy.
[120:17.05]Thank you, Darkstar.
[120:18.09]700,000 games for the $1.
[120:18.87]Oh, he gave up on that shitty FMV, but not really FMV game.
[120:22.13]Thank God.
[120:24.02]Well, I hate to cause you distress here, but you know, you did say that four hours ago.
[120:33.77]Thank you, the long egg for the one dollar.
[120:35.39]The quiet man made my knee even more swollen.
[120:42.31]I'm sorry.
[120:44.53]But at least we did it.
[120:45.79]You can't say I didn't complete that on stream.
[120:48.80]I did.
[120:52.36]Put me on the list of people who I might, who knows.
[120:58.32]You find me another broadcaster that's done the Nintendo Labo, all of them.
[121:03.16]Sorry, all of them.
[121:05.00]On stream.
[121:06.72]And the Quiet Men.
[121:13.98]I mean, I got my hand up up here looking over the ocean here.
[121:16.15]I don't see anybody.
[121:22.47]You literally said you did one with Kim off stream.
[121:25.93]All of them.
[121:29.36]Except for that one.
[121:35.75]Except for that one, but that was just a little joystick one.
[121:41.50]Sorry, so I did 95% of them on stream.
[121:44.82]I did all of them except for the plain joystick.
[121:54.61]Fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.
[121:56.81]It's not right.
[121:59.10]Didn't I just tell you that 80% of the things I say are not true?
[122:06.65]Thank you, uh, Djack for the one dollar.
[122:08.89]Hitman would be a much better game if the guy was deaf and there was no sound.
[122:15.74]I gotta figure out what the hell is going on with my CPU.
[122:19.16]I might, like, flash my BIOS or something.
[122:21.40]Because that made no sense.
[122:22.88]Because it wasn't just the fact that the game was slowing down.
[122:24.68]I was getting encoding errors on OBS, and I haven't had one of those in at least two, three years.
[122:34.48]Am I reading chat?
[122:35.30]Yeah.
[122:36.38]I read chat all the time.
[122:38.23]In fact, probably too much.
[122:43.43]To my own detriment sometimes.
[122:48.79]Thank you, bro.
[122:49.23]Look for the $1.
[122:49.69]Jeremiah, I just realized your country has guns.
[122:59.44]And like Hitman?
[123:00.42]Or you mean like the United States?
[123:08.87]Yeah, I mean, that's accurate, yeah.
[123:19.18]Make sure it's not just the game before you go.
[123:20.98]Yeah, that's true.
[123:21.64]I don't know, I'll do some tests.
[123:25.14]Because that was really weird.
[123:26.58]My CPU went up to 90% when I installed that new driver.
[123:32.38]That was very concerning.
[123:33.32]That's why I had to get out of there.
[123:34.48]And I had to go.
[123:35.28]I had to get out of there right now.
[123:36.20]You know what I mean?
[123:36.88]I had to go.
[123:41.16]I'll do a bench and just make sure everything's fine.
[123:45.87]I wasn't even kidding.
[123:48.05]It's true.
[123:51.57]Thank you, Djack, again for the $1.
[123:53.85]Hitman is too loud.
[123:54.97]Please play a quieter game.
[123:57.49]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.50.
[123:59.22]Cheering these bits to get my new badge.
[124:01.66]$50 is only the beginning.
[124:03.06]Expect much more from me.
[124:05.61]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.50.
[124:09.89]$50 is way more than I could ever ask anyone to give this stream, so.
[124:15.77]Do not ever feel expected or obligated to do that, but thank you.
[124:20.86]We also had some gifted subs.
[124:22.08]Bet3, we talked about it already, but Bet3, nice.
[124:26.00]Five community subs, thank you.
[124:31.62]You guys have been incredibly generous with those, especially lately.
[124:39.71]Broluck, thanks for the $2 here.
[124:41.83]I thought I heard the delivery guy knocking at my door, so I got up excitedly.
[124:45.25]Checked to see if someone was there.
[124:46.33]It was a sound effect in your laggy stream.
[124:52.76]My delivery is here now.
[124:53.78]You're forgiven.
[124:54.66]Well, that's good.
[124:58.66]Do you have to say laggy stream?
[125:00.30]That's like saying... That's like saying shitty stream.
[125:04.82]You know what I mean?
[125:06.69]Like, hearts.
[125:15.97]That's like telling somebody.
[125:18.33]That, okay, you go over, you go over to that house.
[125:21.11]And you sit down, and you, it's like a friend, you know, you're over a friend's house.
[125:25.41]It's not like your mother's cooking.
[125:27.74]It's not your, you know, sister or brother cooking.
[125:30.86]It's me, and you're not used to it, and you don't like it.
[125:33.76]And I give you something that I worked hard on, and I put a lot of time into.
[125:38.10]It was like macaroni and cheese, and you take a bite, and you're like, oh, no, this is disgusting.
[125:41.89]This is gross mac and cheese, gross.
[125:44.31]And I'm like, I...
[125:47.21]That's like saying I've had shitty mac and cheese tonight.
[125:59.24]In quotes, this is a shitpost stream.
[126:03.10]Well, but here's the difference though.
[126:04.22]You came over and you watched me put like random shit in the mac and cheese.
[126:09.34]I didn't just make it.
[126:10.16]I didn't make mac and cheese tonight.
[126:12.27]I took a box of mac and cheese and I said, hey, hold on a second.
[126:15.31]Laughing the whole time.
[126:16.51]I was putting cinnamon and like paprika and a random action figure into it and put it in the oven.
[126:21.65]We were laughing at it.
[126:23.42]That's not my signature recipe.
[126:24.76]That was my just, hey, we're fucking around making gross food.
[126:31.16]That was not my signature mac and cheese recipe.
[126:39.30]Then what's the problem?
[126:40.98]Yeah, there is no problem then, huh?
[126:47.75]If you told me it was gross, then it would be like, oh yeah, it is gross.
[126:50.73]We made it gross on purpose.
[126:52.81]Hey, how dare you?
[126:54.13]Did you just say that was gross?
[126:56.43]There's cinnamon in there.
[126:58.01]There's dog pee in there.
[126:59.23]It's gross.
[127:00.95]Get out of here.
[127:11.86]You guys are fucking awesome.
[127:15.60]There is no problem.
[127:20.48]Thank you cheesy hot pizza for the one dollar.
[127:22.96]How could you hate muffins?
[127:24.08]You're a horrible person.
[127:25.20]What?
[127:26.34]I told you my favorite muffins were cornbread muffin and chocolate chip muffin.
[127:30.60]When did I say hate muffins?
[127:33.99]I talked about my love for chocolate chip muffins.
[127:43.01]Unless you put like an action figure in pizza sauce in there.
[127:46.04]And you did it on purpose.
[127:52.72]Uh, but thank you, Son of Jenova, for the one dollar.
[127:54.66]What?
[128:34.78]How do I listen to it?
[128:40.08]I have to like, download.

[129:06.69]Upload that to like YouTube and then give me a link next time.
[129:16.38]That's a potential security threat.
[129:21.85]Son of Jenova with the sad face.
[129:24.93]Just play it through your headphones.
[129:29.41]Oh.
[129:30.69]Oh man.
[129:38.39]No virus, please.
[129:44.39]39 gigabytes of quiet malware.
[129:53.87]Play it through voice chat in the Discord.
[129:56.27]I just said it.
[129:57.59]Don't do that.
[129:58.33]Don't do that.
[129:58.93]Don't do that.
[130:00.03]Just hang out here.
[130:01.09]Nobody go anywhere.
[130:01.83]Don't leave.
[130:02.29]I'll know you left.
[130:03.05]Oh, why did I say it?
[130:07.90]What have I done?
[130:14.50]That's how you repay him?
[130:15.64]No, just put it on YouTube and we'll watch it on YouTube.
[130:19.93]I want to click a YouTube video.
[130:23.37]I'm scared of links.
[130:24.41]They scare me.
[130:25.15]200 people just wanted to go do that.
[130:31.38]Well, uh, don't do it.
[130:41.48]How do I even open this?
[130:50.75]Did I download it?
[130:52.62]Did I get it?
[131:21.11]Oh, that was, that was terrifying.
[131:26.75]Thank you, though.
[131:29.35]Thank you, Hawkeye of Mine, for $15.
[131:32.17]15 bucks from Hawkeye.
[131:35.72]Oh, man, I'm going to Texas for my 21st to remember the Alamo, so I'll be missing the Jermania streams.
[131:40.80]Darn it.
[131:41.78]Well, it'll be a great welcome home to see it as a VOD.
[131:44.62]Squad boy.
[131:46.59]I had wrong inflection there, but yeah.
[131:50.73]That'll be 21st, down in Texas.
[131:53.00]Hope you have a good time.
[131:59.68]Don't worry, it'll be put on VOD, it'll be put on YouTube eventually as well, so don't worry.
[132:04.89]You'll be able to see it.
[132:07.39]But thank you for $15.
[132:08.81]Really appreciate it.
[132:09.41]Thank you.
[132:10.63]And then right after that, Bet3 gave $25...
[132:16.58]25 bucks from bet three saying thank you jerma thank you I need I thank you for dropping 25 bucks on the stream thank you bet three and you had community subs as well very generous
[132:40.05]Uh, Thor Facts, thanks for the $1.
[132:42.99]Dear video game streamer known as Jerma985 on the popular streaming website Twitch, the audio of your game appears to be a little on the low side.
[132:49.49]Can you, for the sake of your viewers, raise the volume level?
[132:57.68]I went a little crazy tonight.
[133:01.32]Errorless, thanks for the $1.
[133:02.50]Thanks for the English lesson.
[133:03.78]I feel learned very.
[133:06.86]Have luck.
[133:09.70]Thank you, Ereliz.
[133:11.81]It's Weenie, thanks for the $5.
[133:13.99]Thank you, It's Weenie.
[133:15.45]Hey, Jeremy, glad to see you're trying to expand your horizons by finally learning English.
[133:18.83]Here's hoping you can learn Spanish next since a lot of fun music is in Spanish.
[133:24.87]You should try... You haven't embarrassed yourself enough, so I should try... He said Weenie.
[133:48.27]Thank you.
[133:49.89]Thank you, smelly boy, for the $1.
[133:51.13]Finished my essay, turned it in like 20 minutes late, and I returned to the quiet game.
[133:55.50]What the fuck?
[133:57.86]Well, we finished it.
[133:59.02]And you can all say that you finished it, too.
[134:02.62]It was a giant, terrible pizza.
[134:07.03]That I forced myself to eat.
[134:11.29]But good luck.
[134:12.01]Congratulations, and good luck.
[134:16.49]Congrats on getting your essay done.
[134:19.72]Bet3, again, Bet3, another $15 from Bet3.
[134:24.74]Multiple large donations, thank you, Bet3.
[134:27.96]Just to turn my heart on this one.
[134:30.98]Thank you.
[134:34.14]Big money.
[134:37.88]Bet3 with the current number one spot, yep.
[134:40.92]Thank you.
[134:43.68]Uh, thank you, TimmyTimTam, for the $1.
[134:45.96]Better lose some weight.
[134:49.66]Better lose some weight.
[134:55.04]Uh, what is this?
[134:55.54]We eat a lot.
[135:08.80]That's so rude.
[135:39.21]Did you see my car keys?
[135:40.61]They're on top of the TV.
[135:42.17]You're right.
[135:43.13]Thanks.
[135:43.73]Where are you going?
[135:44.79]To the supermarket.
[135:45.79]Again?
[135:46.33]Again?
[135:47.77]Eat a lot.
[135:48.61]Do you want me to go with you?
[135:50.01]Sure, if you can.
[135:51.17]Good.
[135:51.67]The packages will be heavy.
[135:53.17]There's a new health store right up the road.
[135:55.13]Maybe since you guys eat a lot, you should try and eat more healthily.
[135:58.64]Maybe you're right.
[135:59.84]We have all put on a little weight.
[136:03.16]But what?
[136:03.66]The packages will be heavy?
[136:05.86]How much food do you buy?
[136:06.70]Why are you buying 200 pounds of food?
[136:10.77]Thank you, Timmy.
[136:12.97]We eat a lot.
[136:14.87]Maybe you should go there because you eat a lot.
[136:19.21]Thank you, Smacklesmore.
[136:21.19]Smacklesmore for the one dollar.
[136:24.27]So I joined the stream a little late.
[136:26.13]Game looks pretty interesting, but it made my brain shit itself.
[136:28.81]I'll have to ask my tutor to give me a double lobotomy and suck a fart out of my ass to feel normal again.
[136:40.34]Thank you, ExtraCheesy, for the $2.
[136:42.54]You should have played this song during the fight scene in the bar.
[136:49.64]No, I'm not playing the fucking YouTube hilarious funny moments song.
[137:00.51]Thank you, ExtraCheesy.
[137:01.55]Thank you, WhyDoWitchesBurn, for the $4.
[137:06.87]Thanks a lot.
[137:08.43]This is literally all my bits.
[137:09.67]Just wanted you to know this stream was so awful.
[137:12.53]My bones hurt.
[137:13.49]Keep up the good work.
[137:14.73]Thank you.
[137:21.84]Thank you for the $4.
[137:24.78]Spackle Smore.
[137:25.56]Again, thanks for $1.
[137:26.42]Okay, what I said earlier turned out to be not... Turned out to not do any justice to the rest of the stream.
[137:31.12]Go Sans Undertale.
[137:32.70]And thanks, Jerma, for the laughs.
[137:35.52]Hey, thanks.
[137:38.84]Captain Worgen, thanks for the $1, finally figured out what OWO means.
[137:48.94]And it's translated to business.
[137:52.45]Business.
[137:54.91]Okay.
[137:56.45]Interesting.
[137:59.19]Weird.
[138:01.53]I think it's just they want you to play the whole game again.
[138:04.62]But yes, I don't understand either.
[138:26.23]Valuki, thanks for the $1.
[138:27.33]You should have used acid base for that final fight.
[138:29.99]But acid base didn't make it through the 2017 end of the year, beginning of 2018 meme murder spree.
[138:40.14]Sorry.
[138:41.38]Extra, thanks for the $1.
[138:42.70]Extra cheesy.
[138:43.34]Also, this would have been a good fight song as well.
[138:45.66]... ... ...
[138:59.64]Thank you.
[139:00.78]Would have been, maybe.
[139:01.66]I don't know.
[139:02.82]Uh... Mostly lost thanks to the $1.
[139:15.91]So I actually did end up... So I actually did end up Lyft driving this evening.
[139:20.19]And somehow you haven't given up on the game yet when I come back.
[139:22.57]I'm kind of impressed.
[139:24.79]No, we had to... That's a cinnamon.
[139:27.97]But thank you.
[139:28.77]Welcome back.
[139:30.88]E half note, thanks for the one dollar.
[139:32.26]Hey Jerma, I think my previous bits got lost in the computer crash.
[139:35.55]Just want to tell you that thinking about you in the raptor suit brought a smile to my face on a shitty day.
[139:40.93]So thank you for that.
[139:43.69]Thank you.
[139:45.41]Glad you thought it was funny and it is the most embarrassing thing I've ever done in my life.
[139:50.92]Without a doubt.
[139:56.12]But, um... Yep.
[140:00.53]Can't wait to see what you guys make.
[140:05.59]Uh, The Rog.
[140:07.17]Thank you, The Rogster, or The Roadster.
[140:10.43]Thanks for $4.
[140:11.37]No message, just $4.
[140:12.47]Thank you.
[140:15.11]Thanks for the $4.
[140:17.25]Thank you, MooMeansMoo for the $1.
[140:18.55]Your dog-pissed cinnamon streams are better than 90% of the content on this website.
[140:23.71]That's very encouraging.
[140:24.69]Thank you.
[140:28.62]Dog piss cinnamon stream.
[140:31.68]Is that what we're gonna call them now?
[140:36.30]I guess.
[140:37.56]That makes- I mean, yeah, I guess so.
[140:43.75]So anytime we're starting to go off the rails, just- Just bring up that it's turning into a dog piss cinnamon stream.
[140:49.31]And I'll know exactly what you're talking about.
[140:50.73]And I'll be like, whoa, I gotta pull the rails.
[140:53.61]I gotta hit the brakes.
[140:57.79]What?
[140:57.99]Oh my god.
[141:31.38]Only 18, only 18,000 views.
[141:34.24]I'm just picking up on this.
[141:35.32]7.5 million, a million, 1.1 million, 18K.
[141:40.20]Come on, I can vote at least 40, okay?
[141:42.02]I can vote at least like 43,000.
[142:02.38]I could probably bring 150.
[142:02.96]More like 20.
[142:14.80]Aw, thank you, Errorless.
[142:15.68]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $5.
[142:16.58]Hey man, this was a great stream.
[142:19.24]The Quiet Man was a really bad game, in my opinion.
[142:21.55]Well, you'd probably be sharing the opinion of a lot of people.
[142:24.59]Honestly, I have no idea what the story was or anything.
[142:26.39]I feel like I saw the last episode of some anime without watching any of the previous episodes.
[142:31.00]But with all the funny bits, you really kept the ball rolling.
[142:33.92]I'm honestly glad this game exists, because if it didn't, then this stream wouldn't have happened.
[142:38.08]Have a wonderful Thanksgiving.
[142:39.06]Take care.
[142:39.58]Thank you.
[142:42.61]Thank you so much, you as well.
[142:44.77]I'm glad we could turn a cinnamon dog shit stream into something that was a lot of fun.
[142:51.93]So, thanks a lot.
[142:54.64]Happy Thanksgiving to you as well.
[142:55.78]Celebrate it.
[142:57.36]Thank you, Dr. Clay.
[143:01.32]Thank you to Al Bob.
[143:03.66]Thank you, Albo, or Al Bob, for the one dollar.
[143:07.20]Hey, Jerma, I know a lot of people say these kind of things, but I've been watching you for at least six years now, and you're easily my favorite content creator on the internet.
[143:14.17]I love everything you've done, and you never cease to amaze me with the things that you come up with.
[143:17.75]You've done so much for me mentally, I can't even begin on it.
[143:20.95]I often think you're too good to be true because of how many idiots are out there, so I hope you don't accidentally say something very bad one day or something.
[143:31.59]Um...
[143:33.58]No.
[143:37.20]No, I... I'm a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of person.
[143:41.73]And... I mean, I... I'm just... I'm just me.
[143:58.78]Bass is the worst instrument.
[144:00.24]But that was just an 85% Cinnamon Dog piss joke.
[144:12.29]No, I'm... I just do this... I don't have any ulterior motives or anything.
[144:22.57]I don't want to, you know, sell you guys something or try to do something that I'm not capable of or put on some kind of persona that's not real.
[144:34.39]I mean, I'm like this in fucking real life.
[144:39.35]Ask anybody that I know.
[144:43.99]It's exhausting to put on a personality or pretend to be somebody.
[144:48.66]It is.
[144:51.46]It is absolutely exhausting.
[144:53.40]And I do not envy people that do that.
[144:56.02]Because you end up having to put on a face and pretend so often and so long that you have to... It's step one to everything you do and say.
[145:12.10]He randomly uses his tuber voice.
[145:13.86]It's kind of, ah, but like... Also, remember, I mean, I am speaking into a microphone, right?
[145:19.44]So I wanted to... So I guess it's impossible to 100% be the exact same person that you are in reality because I have a microphone here and I want to make sure you can hear it and I have audio set up and I'm being recorded and, you know, obviously I'm trying to be as real as I can.
[145:48.38]But... No, I don't... I don't think you have to worry about me... Trying to, like... Put on a face or... Act... In a different way.
[146:04.37]I just hope that you still think it's fun to be here.
[146:06.41]I mean, that's the... You know, think about... As a viewer, right?
[146:10.87]Some of you guys have been here for a very long time, and... I mean, yeah, sometimes we kind of...
[146:18.67]I could see how some people after a while could be like, oh, it's Jerma again, it's Jerma again, it's Jerma again.
[146:24.45]And I don't know, I feel like I'm trying to keep things as interesting to have you guys not get sick of me, you know?
[146:40.18]Because people have been around for a long time.
[146:43.80]I want to try to keep things interesting for all of us.
[146:50.35]But thank you.
[146:52.38]Thank you to Chubby Funster for the $1.
[146:53.76]Hey, Jerm Boy, I recently lost my job.
[146:55.82]I'm sorry, dude.
[146:57.70]And I've been feeling pretty crappy about the whole thing, but tonight's stream really helped me take my mind off it.
[147:02.10]Not the game, though.
[147:02.96]That was fucking awful.
[147:04.15]But you just shitposting made my face hurt multiple times.
[147:07.73]And I love you for it.
[147:08.53]Well, I'm really sorry to hear about you losing your job.
[147:13.13]Hopefully you can get back into a new job.
[147:17.31]If you're able to take a little bit of time off, figure out what you want to do and where you want to try... I wish you the best of luck.
[147:27.91]And... I'm sorry to hear that, because... You know... I never want to hear about... You know, people not feeling good, people doing bad.
[147:38.52]And we talked about this on the Labo stream a little bit, but... I'm rooting for you all.
[147:44.96]Hopefully you all...
[147:47.01]can take care of yourselves, you know?
[147:55.42]But thank you, Chubby Funster.
[147:57.62]Good luck.
[148:01.51]Flank Tank, thanks for the $4, Flank Tank.
[148:03.43]Hey, did you ever hear some bits?
[148:04.97]I got a crisp, clean $50 I gotta save till you play Nier Automata.
[148:11.09]Like you said you would, maybe after Red Dead 2.
[148:14.00]Oh yeah, I was gonna play that.
[148:18.97]That's true.
[148:21.66]Yeah, get it on the list of video games that I'm gonna play.
[148:27.86]You're gonna give me $50 if I play?
[148:34.28]Damn.
[148:38.27]Yes.
[148:41.47]He's gonna look into it.
[148:42.93]Yeah.
[148:44.77]But, uh...
[148:47.81]We'll see.
[148:48.19]If it's something that I feel like doing, most of the time, besides some of the big plan streams, the day-to-day on the stream is kind of like, oh, what do I feel like doing today?
[148:59.78]What do I want to do next week?
[149:00.82]Or what do I want to plan to do next week?
[149:02.31]And sometimes things just appear.
[149:05.21]Oh, that.
[149:05.57]Yeah, I'll do that.
[149:09.69]So we'll see.
[149:13.02]Thank you, Valuki, for the one dollar.
[149:14.12]I gave you a dollar.
[149:15.18]You do what I say.
[149:16.74]Play the game again and play acid base.
[149:21.69]What?
[149:22.17]No, I'm not gonna play the game again.
[149:23.77]Why would I play that game again?
[149:34.17]Play the fan-made bullet hell game.
[149:38.12]Oh, man.
[149:40.55]Oh, I'm gonna have to look into that one.
[149:42.97]And... Play that.
[149:47.11]Is that for real?
[149:47.77]Because, like, I'm gonna look into that.
[149:50.30]In monster quotes, you know what I mean?
[149:54.52]I'd rather play that when more people are around.
[149:56.18]When it's, like, on, like, actual stream stream.
[149:58.10]Not, like, just hanging out at the end.
[150:03.43]Yeah.
[150:06.02]It's for real.
[150:07.00]Oh, you bet your ass I'm going to definitely... Monster, massive monster quotes.
[150:11.64]I'm going to look into that.
[150:16.41]So... Maybe I'll start with that next stream.
[150:25.01]Because that's really cool.
[150:30.67]Chill out, man.
[150:31.53]I'm chill.
[150:32.11]I'm fine.
[150:32.47]I'm happy.
[150:33.73]Things are great.
[150:35.29]Besides the Hitman technical problems that made me a little sad, I didn't get angry.
[150:39.04]I was just sad.
[150:39.74]I've had a great day today.
[150:42.84]You know what I mean?
[150:48.51]But, thank you to Captain Worgen again.
[150:53.07]Here's what OWO means.
[150:55.87]I know, it says business.
[150:59.07]I don't know, I don't know what this is, I'm not, I don't know.
[151:01.27]No, it's not what it means.
[151:03.13]It's the thing, it's the owl dick thing.
[151:05.67]I know what it is.
[151:06.91]I don't need to, it's fine.
[151:15.97]Yeah, it's an owl dick, and I get it.
[151:18.85]It's two dicks.
[151:21.63]Richard and Richard, they're brothers, okay?
[151:25.13]I'm not gonna get myself in trouble.
[151:27.22]Um...
[151:43.18]I mean, it would just be every single direction.
[151:45.84]Like my side B, my up B, down B. Would just be the power of the sun in a 600 foot long beam.
[151:54.07]In every direction.
[151:54.77]You just press side B and it would do like 40% damage per tick.
[152:01.05]You can just fill the whole screen.
[152:03.29]And no one would ever touch me and I'd win every time.
[152:13.14]That's OP?
[152:15.70]Yeah, it is.
[152:16.22]You think they're gonna patch it?
[152:19.10]Nope.
[152:21.28]So guys, Bayonetta was... was impossible to play against.
[152:27.97]Bayonetta for the Wii U version just beat everybody.
[152:30.75]And she was like an S++++ tier.
[152:36.51]You don't think I read the papers?
[152:38.49]You don't think I pay attention to the papers?
[152:49.86]I wonder what they are going to do, though, because Nintendo does not really at all like to patch games and fighting games in general.
[152:55.45]They kind of require balance updates, don't they?
[152:59.09]I wonder if they're going to do that.
[153:05.23]Did they actually patch Smash Wii U and do balance updates and everything?
[153:15.07]They did have a patch cycle.
[153:17.93]No.
[153:19.79]They patched it twice.
[153:24.80]Well, ah, there's almost 100 characters this time.
[153:28.04]I'm sure there'll be... I'm sure there'll be, like, 5 to 10 characters.
[153:32.68]Because when you make that many characters, it's like a MOBA.
[153:36.24]You know?
[153:36.66]Hey, welcome to League of Legends!
[153:38.84]There are 180 characters in this game.
[153:42.44]But only play 4 of them, 5 of them.
[153:45.53]That are really worth your time.
[153:47.21]Maybe 7 of them.
[153:52.55]Out of the almost 200 characters in League, how many of them are actually worth going into lane with?
[153:58.64]Am I wrong saying that it's like probably 20 characters out of like 100,000?
[154:02.10]About 50?
[154:02.40]About 30?
[154:02.84]How many are in the game?
[154:27.44]15 unless you can one trick certain ones there's like 200 characters in league most of them are actually played now really I remember hearing about people talk about uh there was there was I mean maybe it's the game has changed for the better I don't know
[154:55.43]If you're bad at it like me, you can play whatever you want.
[155:00.57]Yeah, even games like Overwatch.
[155:03.27]And that game had far less characters.
[155:04.89]A while ago, wasn't there... Was it the same two teams facing each other?
[155:18.47]Overwatch meta.
[155:21.20]L-U-L.
[155:23.01]I haven't played it in a long time, so I'm obviously speaking from total ignorance, but... Just play tanks.
[155:38.66]I've seen a lot of people upset at that game.
[155:51.67]But it's all good.
[155:55.37]As long as you're having fun playing the game, then I'm glad you're having fun.
[155:58.99]I'm not going to be one of those people that say, well, you know, the thing is about League and Dota, and the thing about Smite and Overwatch, let me tell you what.
[156:06.04]Whatever.
[156:06.30]If you're having fun, then give us a fuck.
[156:07.82]Just play and have fun.
[156:13.30]But anyways, thank you CluelessSniper for the $5.
[156:16.43]Hey Jerma, thanks for the great stream tonight.
[156:17.97]I started watching your channel in 2012.
[156:19.75]I got hooked watching your GTA 4 videos and you've been a huge part of my life ever since.
[156:24.77]Your content's helped me in more ways than I can fit into a bit message, but being able to rely on you for a laugh has helped me through some rough patches.
[156:32.02]You're one of the most creative, wonderful people on the website and I can't wait to see what the future holds.
[156:35.40]Thanks for everything.
[156:58.41]Yeah.
[157:01.63]I hope you stick around.
[157:08.06]Uh, I process these messages all the time, and... Stick around.
[157:12.28]It should be a lot of fun shit.
[157:14.84]More so than ever before, so... I told you this before, uh... Starting with the green screen stream...
[157:23.08]Every, like, 30 to 45 days, once every month or so, once every other month, I want something that we can all look forward to.
[157:32.20]Something that's not just anything that you're used to.
[157:37.91]Especially being out here, it's going to be far easier, so I hope you stick around.
[157:45.07]But thank you so much, CluelessSniper, for the five bucks.
[157:47.64]And that amazing message, thank you.
[157:52.92]Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the $1.
[157:54.16]These English conversations are fucking gold.
[157:56.30]I can't stop.
[157:57.85]Thank you, Mr. Streamer.
[158:01.83]Thank the... Thank the company that made those, because they're absolute gold.
[158:09.75]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim, again for the $1.
[158:11.59]I never drink coffee at night.
[158:15.72]I never drink coffee at night.
[158:17.12]Oh, God.
[158:22.66]Why are these so good?
[158:26.12]A cup of coffee.
[158:28.62]Can I get you something to drink?
[158:30.18]A cup of coffee, please.
[158:31.44]With milk and sugar?
[158:32.52]A little milk, but no sugar.
[158:34.50]I never drink coffee at night.
[158:36.24]Why not?
[158:36.94]It keeps me awake.
[158:38.64]What do you drink with supper?
[158:40.06]Tea.
[158:40.87]It helps me relax.
[158:42.35]I don't like tea.
[158:43.41]There are so many kinds of tea.
[158:45.53]Maybe you should shop around and try to find one you like because coffee is bad for you.
[158:52.96]Okay, do you guys remember those streams that had the two robots talking to each other?
[158:59.59]That bounced back and forth off each other.
[159:01.37]It was a popular stream for a long time.
[159:05.39]That's just, this is what this reminds me of.
[159:06.86]The two Alexas having a conversation.
[159:12.36]That's a good idea.
[159:15.12]A cup of coffee.
[159:17.60]Can I get you something to drink?
[159:19.14]A cup of coffee, please.
[159:20.41]With milk and sugar?
[159:21.47]A little milk, but no sugar.
[159:23.47]I never drink coffee at night.
[159:25.21]Why not?
[159:25.91]It keeps me awake.
[159:27.61]What do you drink with supper?
[159:29.03]Tea.
[159:29.85]It helps me relax.
[159:31.34]I don't like tea.
[159:32.38]There are so many kinds of tea.
[159:34.50]Maybe you should shop around and try to find one you like, because coffee is bad for you.
[159:40.37]That's a good idea.
[159:43.68]Because coffee is bad for you.
[159:46.88]Coffee is bad for you.
[159:49.86]Is bad for you.

[161:32.31]Still a great song.
[161:35.04]Hey Laund2, thanks for the $1 here.
[161:37.96]Hey Jerma, as someone that thrives in front of a camera, do you have any advice for someone who has never been on camera?
[161:43.02]I'll be attending a big Dota 2 tournament, and I'm nervous that I'll make a fool of myself on camera.
[161:47.39]I have loved the stream, keep it up.
[161:48.73]Yeah, I mean, here's the best advice I could give you about being in front of a camera.
[161:58.74]You treat the camera like it's somebody you want to talk to.
[162:03.86]Because you do.
[162:06.18]You know?
[162:07.77]The camera is an extension of people's eyes.
[162:12.51]And I've always just kind of treated the camera like a friend, you know?
[162:17.09]Somebody that I want to talk to.
[162:17.99]Because I do want to talk.
[162:18.97]And I do want to talk to it.
[162:20.85]So you can kind of imagine that the camera is actually a person.
[162:24.56]That you're hanging out with.
[162:25.70]And it's not that far from the truth.
[162:35.71]Give it a try.
[162:38.11]Camera's a friend.
[162:42.25]Except cameras don't want to talk to you.
[162:46.23]Yeah, but the camera doesn't have a mouth, it has eyes.
[162:54.86]But hopefully that helps you out.
[162:57.08]Good luck in the tournament.
[163:01.49]Hopefully you do well.
[163:04.47]Don't know much about Dota 2, but hope you, uh, hope you knock it out of the park.
[163:10.01]Uh, thank you, Son of Jenova, for the one dollar.
[163:11.83]Not a virus.
[163:13.53]Okay.
[163:15.19]It's a YouTube link, so it can't be a virus.
[163:22.10]Here's the chatbot thing.
[163:24.18]To talk to a woman for a change.
[163:26.12]So you don't talk with women often?
[163:28.96]That's right, but there should be limits.
[163:31.04]I don't know, but it's the Twitter people who won't talk to me.
[163:35.05]Whispers.
[163:36.33]Why?
[163:37.21]Whispers.
[163:38.77]I don't know.
