[00:00.60]Hello?
[00:03.66]Good afternoon.
[00:08.35]My name, if I may present myself, is... Mixie!
[00:12.29]Nice to finally meet you face to face!
[00:14.27]Ho ho ho ho!
[00:27.67]Really?
[00:29.45]Hold on.
[00:30.05]Did I... You make a 3D Movie Maker reference and you see -2?
[00:36.30]Really guys?
[00:37.00]That's interesting.
[00:40.12]I wonder if... That's odd.
[00:42.52]I really thought that was gonna hit.
[00:47.46]Well anyways, hi, welcome.
[00:53.58]We are at the point of the stream when we do Sam & Max.
[00:59.49]This will be the final Salmon Max themed streams.
[01:06.59]After Season 3, I have no plans on doing the rest of Salmon Max, all the other games that they have.
[01:12.18]There's no plan to do that.
[01:13.76]But if I start at Season 1, I want to do Season 2 and Season 3.
[01:18.26]And that's what we're gonna do.
[01:19.62]After this, you might not see it again.
[01:22.93]Because I know that there is at least one or two other games in this franchise.
[01:30.90]But there are a couple other things to talk about before we get started.
[01:35.72]First thing to talk about is we have some things to watch.
[01:42.39]We have two videos from yesterday that I want to show.
[01:53.33]And we'll get them on the screen.
[01:54.37]We'll just wait.
[01:54.83]Just give me a minute.
[01:55.97]Let people trickle in.
[01:57.59]And I'll be with you very shortly.
[02:00.07]Two minutes.
[02:21.60]Okay So this first one we're gonna watch
[02:51.20]is from It's Time for Slime.
[02:55.28]This is called JermaDOS.
[02:59.82]Let's go ahead and get it on the screen for you.

[07:41.23]I can't believe it.
[07:45.25]Nintendo is not in the chat.
[07:47.21]You can give a community sub to anybody.
[07:48.56]Are they here?
[07:52.30]Nintendo.
[07:53.98]Liars.
[07:55.16]Sometimes you have to check.
[07:56.26]What if they were, like, scouting me out to do, like, a... I don't know, like a Super Mario sponsorship or something.
[08:04.87]It could happen.
[08:06.15]Alright, here we go.
[08:08.55]That was from back in.
[08:09.31]Let's go.
[08:09.71]Let's watch this video.
[08:10.43]This is called Germados.
[08:12.63]Are you ready?
[08:14.13]One.
[08:17.52]Two, three, no porn games.
[08:54.63]to the other side of the table.
[09:27.48]Wait, what did that say?
[09:39.33]Of course it has to end on that.
[09:41.85]It has to end on-
[09:50.27]I clocked you rooming at 32 over the limit.
[09:52.90]I hate to do it, but I'm gonna have to write you up a ticket.
[09:55.36]Okay, here we go Look at that face Speaking of movies that is what it looks like in the dark When you are talking
[10:12.53]And somebody in front of you looks behind to try to essentially tell you to... That's like a shut the fuck up face.
[10:18.21]That's like a what are you really doing this face?
[10:21.01]That's what it looks like in the dark.
[10:38.72]Oh, yeah, it's like this.
[10:40.89]Here comes, like, the climax of the movie.
[10:44.85]Oh my god, here he comes!
[10:46.21]I can't say any, I can't make a pretend climax, because somebody will say it's a spoiler for some movie.
[10:54.23]Like, right now, the person is describing their love for the other character.
[10:59.44]And they're about to, like, have a big kiss moment.
[11:02.96]They're about to kiss on screen.
[11:25.91]And then they just go.
[11:26.91]And they turn back around.
[11:30.27]Nobody talks like shit anymore.
[11:32.15]Have you noticed that?
[11:32.73]I don't know what it... It used to be.
[11:37.13]You'd be sitting in a movie theater and somebody would be like, Shit!
[11:39.45]Shut up!
[11:41.31]No.
[11:41.51]When was the last time you heard somebody scream at a movie theater before?
[11:47.97]I've been to a bunch of movies in the last few years and I have not heard it.
[11:52.90]I mean, I've done it a few times, but that's me doing that.
[11:59.40]Am I the guy now?
[12:01.58]I don't hear other people do it, it's just me.
[12:05.00]Right, okay.
[12:10.91]Oh shit, I got too old.
[12:11.87]Alright, here comes the next one.
[12:14.75]The next one is another.
[12:15.47]It's an animation from Googly Gareth.
[12:20.12]They passed the theater yelling torch to you.
[12:26.61]Maybe they did.
[12:28.71]No, I don't want to yell.
[12:29.59]I don't yell in movie theaters.
[12:34.64]Who do you think I am?
[12:38.74]I yell after the movie's over.
[12:41.44]I clap at the credits.

[13:16.94]Well, it doesn't matter.
[13:18.26]That's not my style.
[13:20.62]That's not my style.

[13:38.05]Brush your teeth if you want.
[13:39.31]Not go to fucking jail, kids.
[13:41.43]Nobody can beat me in this.
[13:43.59]I'm so much more popular than all these people.

[13:48.77]Have you seen my Jerm commercial?
[13:50.79]It's ten times better.

[14:16.80]25,000.

[14:50.96]You already got the cheeky answer in there.
[14:52.98]Who's the one person that wrote love?
[14:54.98]And like, you know, you know, when they asked him, they said love and they winked.
[14:58.28]It's going to be love.

[15:17.15]Love.
[15:18.39]And then they, like, tripped and dropped their fucking coffee and the rest of their day sucked.
[15:21.71]They, like, stepped in a fucking huge puddle after they said that.
[15:24.09]They were like, oh, yeah, love, wink.

[15:32.49]And it fucking goes all over their fucking pants and shit.
[15:34.71]And their coffee goes everywhere.
[15:35.83]And the rest of their day was terrible.

[16:14.76]Fuck it, we're doing Hugh Grant.
[16:16.04]Wait, what?
[16:18.10]I gotta look this up right now.
[16:20.64]How do I look?
[16:21.38]I'm just gonna type it into Google right now.

[17:12.35]Donald fucking Duck!
[17:18.98]Wow, very impressive, Player One.
[17:38.78]What a shitty ending!
[17:41.98]Ah, that was, those were fucking great.
[17:45.63]That was called, uh, Streaming Superstar.
[17:48.47]By Googly Gareth, a very talented animator.
[17:56.21]I'm not, I'm not like that, you know?
[17:58.84]This is, this is specific clips that I've taken of, of moments where I, you know, have a little bit of trouble.
[18:04.76]But it's not like that all the time.
[18:06.12]If you're new to the channel,
[18:08.40]It's not really, it's not like that all the time.
[18:11.22]It's only like that like sometimes.
[18:15.50]If a stream is like seven or eight hours, I feel like four hours is that.
[18:19.41]That's not even 40%.
[18:19.91]That's like, that's a half.
[18:27.83]It's only when he's talking.
[18:33.70]It's funnily enough.
[18:35.59]40-50% of the stream probably is me talking.
[18:40.03]The other 50-60% is like game stuff and stuff on the screen.
[18:44.48]So, you know, you're probably right.
[18:48.82]Anyways, those are two very, very, very, very funny, very interesting videos back to back.
[18:56.11]We're going to move on from that.
[18:56.95]We're going to do, we're going to start Sam & Max Season 3.
[19:06.46]You have to have a high enough percentage to be a C plus streamer.
[19:09.54]I'll take a C plus.
[19:10.64]No, it's B minus.
[19:12.66]I was downgraded.
[19:14.52]What's it on social blade right now?
[19:17.41]I haven't checked this in a long time, actually.
[19:19.95]What is it?
[19:24.85]What's my Twitch social blade right now?
[19:31.19]What do I have for a grade?
[19:36.41]Oh, come on, man.
[19:37.33]That's a B+.
[19:39.45]It used to be B-.
[19:46.50]Oh, I'm happy about that.
[19:50.92]Oh, this is not an intro anymore.
[19:53.94]Hey, look at that.
[19:55.14]Sam and Max.
[19:57.80]So, again, we're going to play this for... That's what we're going to do today.
[20:02.66]Tomorrow, by the way, Star and I are going to play something.
[20:06.56]We don't know what it is.
[20:07.32]It's going to be a mystery game.
[20:09.15]We both actually don't know what the game is.
[20:11.13]We haven't talked.
[20:12.49]All I know is that we're going to play something together.
[20:16.59]I'm sure we'll probably figure that out in like an hour before the stream.
[20:19.63]So, I'll see you tomorrow.
[20:20.71]No, no, no.
[20:21.13]I'm not leaving yet.
[20:26.91]We'll do that tomorrow.
[20:31.05]But for today, we're going to do Sam and Max.
[20:34.63]Let's watch two videos and end the stream after 20 minutes.
[20:39.71]Speaking of stuff happening on the stream.
[20:44.45]KXZ gave $50.
[20:47.59]Thank you, KXZ, for your 50 bucks.

[21:09.07]Was there a third video?
[21:24.20]This looks like a meme video.
[21:26.50]Is this a meme video?

[21:49.74]Okay.

[25:18.51]Alright.
[25:20.55]Welcome to Sam and Max.
[25:23.99]Enjoy your stay here.
[25:26.73]What?
[25:29.03]New game.
[25:29.37]I don't know how loud this is going to be.
[25:31.60]Prepare yourself.
[25:36.29]How is it?
[25:36.61]Is it alright?
[25:38.81]Is it good?
[25:41.19]Or is it too loud?
[25:42.45]Too loud.
[25:43.97]Is it too loud?
[25:44.56]I can't see it over here.
[25:46.16]I need a mod to ex... It's loud?
[25:51.66]In all the universe, the only power beyond the mind's comprehension is the power to comprehend the power of the mind.
[26:04.52]If any one of us could unlock this terrible power, would we use it to explore the mysteries of the infinite?
[26:12.61]Or would we use it to destroy?
[26:15.11]Yes.
[26:18.27]Yes.
[26:19.97]Tremble, earthlings.
[26:22.92]Tremble before the might of General Scutari.
[26:32.30]You know, Sam, Skunk Ape may be a tool, but he brings a refreshingly childlike glee to his work.
[26:38.86]I'm here, Max.
[26:41.60]It's hard to stay mad at this guy.
[26:54.69]Witness, Simon Max.
[26:58.11]I didn't know if I was going to skip it accidentally or not.
[27:02.68]I didn't know.
[27:30.40]Okay.
[27:32.06]I think we're good.
[27:33.78]Which one of us is the fuzzy one?
[27:35.78]Better?
[27:36.42]It's a familiar tale.
[27:38.56]A power-mad space gorilla pitted against a canine detective and a sociopathic bunny with psychic powers.
[27:47.51]But, my friends, this story is different.
[27:51.12]In this story, you are in control.
[27:54.44]Only you can release our heroes from General Skunkape's bizarre space suit.
[28:00.72]Only you can guide them in their quest to bring the villain to space justice.
[28:06.55]Are you ready?
[28:08.29]Let's begin by finding the proper tool.
[28:13.67]I knew somebody was going to say it.
[28:14.69]One person said it at least.
[28:15.51]Gotta get a cell phone.
[28:16.23]Whoa, whoa, whoa, 3D!
[28:16.83]Alright, you can switch...
[28:39.47]Try switching to Max to use his psychic powers.
[28:41.23]Okay.
[28:57.17]Why does Max have psychic powers in this one?
[28:59.89]Okay.
[29:00.17]Okay.
[29:25.33]The toy phone has a button for each of the phone numbers Max has memorized.
[29:31.21]Click on the button with Stinky's picture to teleport to her cell phone.
[29:53.45]This is a jokey thing, right?
[29:54.61]We have to do that every time?
[29:55.99]Oh, baby, I've missed you.
[30:14.98]Now what?
[30:16.32]Listen to the brain!
[30:19.65]Hey, Sam.
[30:20.31]It's our new pal, the disembodied alien brain.
[30:22.81]The same.
[30:23.97]I am speaking to you telepathically.
[30:27.01]No one else can hear me, Sam and Max.
[30:30.62]Hi, Dan.
[30:32.28]Shut up.
[30:33.20]Your Earth weapons will never be enough to defeat General Skunkavne.
[30:38.00]Don't you still have that homing beacon?
[30:43.40]Okay, to see what Sam is carrying in his inventory, click on the cardboard box in the corner.
[30:47.07]Alright, so there's a cardboard box still here.
[30:49.13]These are all the items.
[30:51.77]Find the homing beacon and left-click on it to make Sam pull it out.
[30:54.71]This is the remote control.
[30:59.02]This is the homing beacon.
[31:01.44]Do I have to just click it?
[31:03.28]Okay.
[31:06.11]Perfect.
[31:07.05]Now, you must place the homing beacon on General Scuncape's back to trap him in the Penal Zone.
[31:19.46]Easy.
[31:19.74]Throw it.
[31:20.78]As hard as you can.
[31:23.46]Click on a target, make Sam use it on that, yeah, put it on the, yeah.
[31:26.00]Just throw it as hard as you can.
[31:27.82]Just don't miss.
[31:29.44]Hm?
[31:31.37]What's that?
[31:35.25]Did you really believe it would be that easy?
[31:37.94]Kinda.
[31:38.26]Kinda, yeah.
[31:39.38]We're gonna need some kind of cover to get up close and personal with Skunking.
[31:43.12]Max, remember that you have been blessed with the gift.
[31:46.72]You must unlock your abilities with the remaining toys of power.
[31:51.00]Behold!
[31:53.29]Meat?
[31:53.91]Hang on.
[31:54.31]There we go.
[31:57.93]Is that a nose?
[31:59.39]That's a nose.
[32:02.73]Okay.
[32:02.85]Okay.
[32:04.29]You can make Sam use objects in the world by just... Can I just click it?
[32:07.65]Okay, so I got the nose.
[32:26.46]This is a dream sequence or something.
[32:29.28]They do that in these games.
[32:31.30]Max, now how's the power of rhinoplasty?
[32:33.66]Remember, stop doing that.
[32:35.72]Remember that you can left-click on one of the psychic toys to activate it.
[32:52.32]When the rhinoplasty is selected, Max first has to choose a picture of the thing he wants to turn into.
[32:58.04]You can make Max look around by clicking and dragging W-A-S-D.
[33:03.78]And then left-click on a picture to make Max pick it up.
[33:11.49]A plant?
[33:16.31]You can turn into that object.
[33:17.74]You can click on the lump of rhinoplasty to activate it.
[33:25.81]I think I can do it.
[33:26.63]You can make Sam walk by clicking and dragging.
[33:29.42]You can do... They added WASD.
[33:30.76]Finally, okay.
[33:58.31]It's just a plant.
[34:03.35]Oh, a plant.
[34:06.71]I love what you've done with the place, my queen.
[34:13.20]He is talking really well for those teeth where they are.
[34:20.74]Alright, remote control.
[34:23.76]Some of the objects in the same inventory can be activated on their own.
[34:36.59]Highlight the Penal Zone remote control and then left-click the activate icon.
[34:39.71]Alright, well, hold on.
[34:42.35]That's activate, right?
[34:53.54]Well done, Sam and Max.
[34:57.18]But I'm far too strong to be captured again.
[35:01.40]Soon this gateway will close and there will be nothing to stop me.
[35:06.70]This should be blood all over his mouth.
[35:08.96]You would cut your mouth off every time you talk.
[35:13.57]I'm talking about, like, a big, like, Kool-Aid stain of blood all over your whole mouth.
[35:17.75]Can I do WASD?
[35:18.33]Oh, you can.
[35:19.13]Is there a run?
[35:20.17]Is there a double tap and a run?
[35:44.28]Space?
[35:45.00]Shift?
[35:46.24]Oh, Shift is run.
[35:47.40]Just like a regular video game.
[35:48.68]Alright, Harry Moleman, how you doing?
[35:50.42]Do you know how we can beat Skunkade?
[35:57.18]Poor Harry.
[35:58.22]General Skunkade put him in this penny-conscious terrarium.
[36:00.98]I gotta turn some shit down.
[36:02.00]I can't even hear them talking.
[36:02.98]Even if he could hear you through the glass, Sam, the sun lamp has made him even more worthless than usual.
[36:11.15]Max, you'll have to use another one of the Toys of Power.
[36:14.77]Another one?
[36:17.41]Hold on.
[36:18.35]First of all, excuse me.
[36:26.46]Look at where it is!
[36:27.20]I did my due diligence here.
[36:28.24]Look at this.
[36:29.06]I tried.
[36:40.03]Do I have full cell phone coverage or like going through a tunnel for hint level?
[36:43.93]What do you think?
[36:45.64]I'm gonna keep it default.
[36:47.28]Disable hints.
[36:50.38]Tunnel?
[36:52.54]No, but what if I gotta make a call?
[36:55.04]No, I can't.
[36:58.37]What do you mean disable?
[37:00.45]This is the default.
[37:02.67]You have us.
[37:07.19]I'm doing... I'm staying default.
[37:11.04]I'm not changing it.
[37:15.57]One bar is fair.
[37:18.65]That's the default.
[37:20.03]Look, if it's too easy, then I'll... I didn't use any hints in the last one.
[37:25.66]I just pretended to know what I was doing and would read chat and some one person would say the solution.
[37:31.94]And then I would walk around for like a couple minutes pretending I was solving the puzzle.
[37:37.61]When in reality, I knew the answer like 10 minutes before and was just piecing it all together to make it look like I knew what was going on.
[37:55.29]That, I'm kidding.
[37:56.77]You guys are taking this too literal.
[38:00.13]How much lower do I have to make everything?
[38:01.65]How's that?
[38:06.40]Is that alright?
[38:08.30]That sounds a little better.
[38:12.58]Now the music's too quiet.
[38:13.58]Well, there's nothing I can do about it.
[38:14.92]Alright, how do I...
[38:21.69]I'm trying to- oh, it's not- it's shift.
[38:24.04]I'm- I'm double tapping.
[38:28.50]Okay.
[38:30.64]It's an ordinary deck of playing cards.
[38:33.52]Or is it?
[38:37.91]Max, the playing cards have granted you the power to thrust your consciousness into the fleshy minds of others and pluck out their most intimate thoughts.
[38:48.60]Eww.
[38:49.74]Only you can take something as beautiful and natural as telepathy and make it sound wrong.
[38:56.54]Look.
[38:58.88]Look.
[39:00.15]Look.
[39:01.51]Okay, voice up, music up.
[39:04.27]Are you ready?
[39:04.65]Alright, we can use the... Let's telepathically... Let's see what Stinky's thinking.
[39:18.21]Don't let them break you, Harry.
[39:18.99]Your name is Harry Mooney.
[39:19.65]Your serial number is 2483562.
[39:47.22]Your cell number is 2-1-2-5-5-5-4-8-6-5.
[39:50.30]Your favorite color is taupe.
[39:54.40]You have an infection of the lower... Okay, that's enough of that.
[39:58.48]Hey, Sam, I got Harry Mole Man's phone number.
[40:00.91]Nice work, little buddy.
[40:02.31]Make sure you wait three days to call, or he'll think you're desperate.
[40:05.47]Excellent, Max.
[40:06.69]That phone number might be enough, because General Skunkape locked the Mole Man's cell phone and other belongings inside this container.
[40:17.76]So you can adjust the volume on the game, but can you backflip off of the trampoline?
[40:27.41]Um... Maybe.
[40:30.69]Let's all go for a ride in my magical balloon.
[40:34.48]I think I missed the last instruction because I was laughing at chat.
[40:41.40]What does it want me to do?
[40:43.44]Call Moorman.
[40:52.42]Can I sum up the story?
[40:53.82]Um... There really isn't that much of a story.
[40:56.42]My... They're pretty self-contained.
[41:08.88]Max is president.
[41:09.78]Okay, so Max is president.
[41:11.24]Somehow we won the election.
[41:12.58]That's pretty much the only real major thing that happened.
[41:16.14]Oh, and like aliens came in and captured Bosco and...
[41:38.35]And then we went to the center of the universe and, like, put a chick in there, and then an egg came out.
[41:44.11]And... That's pretty much it.
[41:46.59]Alright, let's do the... Turn Max into a... Bazooka.
[41:48.49]See, now the music's too loud!
[41:49.53]I told you!
[41:50.05]I told you guys!
[42:10.28]Alright, let's turn into a bazooka.
[42:16.62]Good work, Max.
[42:17.89]Now, let's... I'm a bazooka, Sam!
[42:19.59]A bazooka!
[42:20.83]Oh, just give me a moment to savor this.
[42:23.81]Oh, yes!
[42:24.97]Turn into a boffet.
[42:26.13]Uh-oh.
[42:30.51]Uh-oh.
[42:31.79]Lock and load, Max.
[42:35.10]Be careful with that trigger finger, Sam!
[42:37.72]Hey, skunky!
[42:39.26]Say hello to my little body!
[42:54.08]Friends, you have just participated in a troubling vision of the future.
[43:00.01]The first of many such disturbing revelations.
[43:04.37]Over the next five chapters, you will witness things that baffle you, horrify you, even disgust you.
[43:12.75]But you must not look away.
[43:14.83]Pay close attention to everything that you see and hear.
[43:18.86]Because when our story reaches its bowel-tingling climax, only you, my friends, will possess the ability to save the entire universe.
[43:36.07]Easy!
[43:36.87]That car!
[43:40.67]We actually get an intro this time.
[43:42.21]It's not just the silhouette.
[44:03.82]Silhouettes were cooler.
[44:07.67]I do like the silhouettes.
[44:08.55]Although this is cool, too.
[44:17.63]I don't know why my brain is wired so strangely, but I thought that that just said, like, written by... Like, directed, executive produced by Sam and Max.
[44:28.59]Like, they made this.
[44:29.63]I don't know.
[44:32.09]Hey, Sam!
[44:32.97]This haunted toy I found just gave me an uncanny vision of our violent future!
[44:37.38]I know, I saw it too, somehow.
[44:40.00]Did your version have credits?
[44:42.16]It had a spaceship, a friendly alien brain in a jar... This looks different.
[44:45.34]...and an evil space gorilla trying to destroy the city.
[44:48.19]What could it all mean?
[44:54.03]The mouth animations almost look like that TF2 meme video we just watched.
[44:59.49]Like they made it a putty with players on it.
[45:27.70]Is there a vignette on the game?
[45:31.44]I almost think there's a filter on it or something.
[45:37.61]Creatures of Earth, I am General Skunkape.
[45:42.79]Hear my words.
[45:52.32]I have come to you with a message of peace and love.
[46:00.85]Sorry about that building.
[46:08.45]Do the Thanos voice?
[46:09.95]Nah, no.
[46:10.23]More time travel, more going back.
[46:32.71]Our story begins 25 minutes ago.
[46:36.09]What?
[46:36.59]On a street very much like this one.
[46:41.72]You've got a phone call.
[46:44.50]This is Sam and Max, Freelance Police.
[46:46.70]Is that a corndog?
[46:54.30]Hello, Commissioner.
[46:59.58]No, we're not in the office.
[47:00.90]We're locked out of our building.
[47:02.90]It wasn't my fault this time.
[47:08.95]Here you go.
[47:09.69]People were asking about the TL;DR.
[47:11.43]Here it is.
[47:11.71]So this is season three.
[47:12.47]I feel like we're getting a lot of did you forget who these people were exposition here.
[47:28.50]More than we did last time.
[47:37.45]There aren't any crimes for us to solve?
[47:40.17]Okay then, we'll be on the lookout for anything suspicious.
[47:43.37]There's a big time difference, now that makes sense, okay.
[47:45.42]The brain is dying.
[47:48.38]I'll have to call you back, Commissioner.
[47:55.42]Max has psychic powers now, apparently.
[47:58.37]What the fuck is happening?
[47:59.09]Alright.
[47:59.31]Oh, I have to remember this guy.
[48:01.51]What's this guy's name?
[48:02.41]Homerun?
[48:02.93]Something like that?
[48:03.82]What's his name?
[48:04.64]Sup- Yeah, Superball.
[48:08.20]Okay.
[48:31.36]Alright, let's take a look.
[48:32.34]Let's take a look around first.
[48:33.96]We've got, let me see.
[48:35.30]Worst news.
[48:37.41]City Dirtification Project, a resounding success.
[48:40.33]Mayor credits New Jersey's rich supplies of rust, grime, crud, and skank.
[48:46.03]I just saw Jimmy Two Teeth up here.
[48:53.93]What about, can we go down?
[48:54.97]Into the subway?
[48:56.09]Alright, let's start fresh.
[48:58.13]Sneaky's done.
[49:04.16]How about you go slay some creepers in Minecraft?
[49:10.98]I mean, the only way I'm gonna turn Minecraft on is if I lose a bet.
[49:14.18]That's pretty much the only way how that works now.
[49:17.02]Ah, Stinky's Diner.
[49:18.52]The perfect place to catch up with old friends.
[49:21.51]And meet new ones, like emergency medical technicians and the friendly folks at Poison Control.
[49:32.81]Good thing you lose every bet.
[49:37.10]Oh, really?
[49:37.54]Never mind.
[49:40.04]There's no coins in here.
[49:42.68]Strawberry?
[49:44.32]I don't lose every bet.
[49:50.53]Beet juice and ham.
[49:51.49]I just realized that's fucking gross.
[49:55.55]Oh, there he is.
[49:56.21]Can I talk to him?
[50:05.44]This does control.
[50:06.20]This plays a lot different than the other ones.
[50:12.88]Oh, hi, Barney and Jugjug.
[50:21.31]Barney and Jugjug?
[50:22.65]You're not even trying with the names anymore, are you?
[50:25.53]Barney.
[50:26.09]Look, I've got a lot going on.
[50:28.02]Can I just give you your key or your crystal shard or whatever it is you're looking for so you guys can go off and do whatever it is you do?
[50:35.24]Sorry, Stinky.
[50:36.08]We gotta go through all the questions.
[50:37.76]Oh, by the way, yeah.
[50:39.05]Whatever.
[50:39.77]She is, like, a cake, right?
[50:44.19]Oh, we get, like, a Mass Effect-style radio menu here.
[50:47.83]Alright, how about... The aliens have landed.
[50:54.00]Oh, really?
[50:55.54]I haven't heard anything about that at all.
[50:58.20]Keep your guard up.
[50:59.12]We're about 99.8% sure he's evil.
[51:00.22]He's not even human!
[51:06.62]Tingy just gave five community subs.
[51:07.92]Thanks a lot, Tingy.
[51:11.59]Tingy continuing the quest of 100 million community subs.
[51:17.25]Thank you so much, Tingy.
[51:19.21]Things must be easier now that Grandpa Tinky's back.
[51:22.05]Oh, yes.
[51:22.97]It's heaven.
[51:23.59]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[51:24.61]Look at what he's doing to the place.
[51:26.41]He's totally destroying the ambiance.
[51:29.15]Yeah, this place used to be an aggravated assault on all five senses.
[51:33.12]Now it's just a misdemeanor battery.
[51:35.28]Six senses, Sam.
[51:36.62]You always have the uncanny premonition of severe stomach upset in your future.
[51:42.22]How's the food?
[51:42.58]Okay, let's see.
[51:43.50]I'll take a double bacon cheddar butter deluxe, heavy on the wacky sauce.
[51:47.26]That sounds good.
[51:47.70]Two orders of jalapeño cheesy poofters, Rhode Island style.
[51:51.08]No, three!
[51:52.42]Okay, three.
[51:53.31]And let's throw in one of the eight bean casseroles with extra onion rings and finish it off with a jumbo-sized frosty banana mint pickle cyclone chugger with extra jimmies.
[52:02.57]Get the pickle out of there.
[52:04.55]Oh, and some bangers and mash.
[52:06.31]Hold the mash.
[52:08.05]I'm on break.
[52:13.03]you again soon stinky yeah take your time okay what does grandpa have to say I guess having just a jukebox wasn't loud and annoying enough wait there were more options were there are you still here oh what happened to your fry cook
[52:38.65]Yeah, what was his name?
[52:39.81]Sal or Pablo or Muhammad or something?
[52:42.92]You boys must be mistaken.
[52:44.68]It's always been just me here, working the kitchen.
[52:47.60]No one else.
[52:49.40]That's why I'm so grateful Grandpa Stinky's back.
[52:52.42]Okay.
[52:54.22]But hold on.
[52:56.07]You and Grandpa Stinky should patch things up.
[52:58.29]Can't you see what it's doing to Max?
[53:00.59]I hate it when they fight!
[53:03.48]Pretty good Jerma voice right there.
[53:04.68]Pretty good Jerma voice.
[53:08.60]Intriguing!
[53:10.42]I signed us up for relationship counseling and a business management seminar.
[53:13.70]No.
[53:14.40]Alright, let's see you again soon, Stinky.
[53:18.75]Yeah.
[53:19.37]Take your time.
[53:20.05]Whoa, what's going on?
[53:23.91]What about the pie?
[53:24.75]Ever since girl Stinky took over the kitchen, Stinky's signature pies have gotten marginally more edible.
[53:29.95]The insect bits give the dough that extra bit of crunch.
[53:32.88]Gonna be eating insects in, like, 2050.
[53:34.86]Hope you guys like the taste of crickets, because that's what you're gonna be getting at, like, Taco Bell.
[53:47.17]Demon broth?
[53:49.85]What?
[53:51.35]I mean, explain myself.
[53:53.27]What are you talking about?
[54:03.29]Don't you guys- haven't you guys read the studies that, like, the only real sustainable food source of humanity is gonna be bugs in the next, like, hundred years?
[54:11.75]Already did this joke.
[54:12.65]This is not a joke.
[54:13.63]This is me telling you what's gonna happen in a hundred years.
[54:16.74]This is not a joke.
[54:22.50]This is just what's gonna happen.
[54:24.96]Oh, good.
[54:26.18]You two are back to barrage me with your inane questions.
[54:34.93]We missed you too, Grandpa Stinky.
[54:37.03]Did the health inspectors ever make you wear a beard net?
[54:39.26]I'll tell you, type in bugs food source in the future.
[54:47.56]People way smarter than me have talked about this.
[54:51.45]What's cooking?
[54:52.75]Oh, you'd like me to tell you about me demon broth, wouldn't you?
[54:56.83]So you can steal another patent.
[54:59.81]Come on, you're not still angry about that, are you?
[55:02.73]That was like 30 years ago.
[55:04.07]And that's 30 years I could have been living off the riches from a gooey molasses tar cake.
[55:10.86]I heard this on the Joe Rogan podcast.
[55:12.76]If you're so curious about it, pick up a can after I've made a fortune selling it to every grocery store from here to Madagascar.
[55:27.23]Ugh.
[55:34.39]Oh my god.
[55:35.29]Okay, I need to like, let's get off of this.
[55:41.02]Just know that by 2150 there's gonna be ant soft-serve machines.
[55:48.42]And that's what you're gonna take for your protein source.
[55:52.98]It must be great getting back to work with your partner again.
[55:55.98]I don't know.
[55:56.40]He's kind of cramping my style.
[55:58.12]Oh, you were talking to him.
[55:59.64]Yeah, never mind.
[56:00.94]Oh, it's great.
[56:02.46]She has me working the register and making deliveries.
[56:05.66]A master chef like myself.
[56:08.50]That already is there.
[56:10.02]You already explained, Grandpa.
[56:13.29]I just have to make it nicer so that it's worthy of your skills.
[56:23.60]That's fucking funny.
[56:25.44]Alright, okay.
[56:26.58]Alright, let's like... Alright, let's go.
[56:41.57]You do anything where you talk to chat and walk around in circles?
[56:44.10]Yeah, that's fine.
[56:44.80]I... I mean, it is a point-and-click adventure game.
[57:03.27]I just want to look around for a little bit.
[57:04.39]OK, let's go over here.
[57:09.73]Oh, no.
[57:33.00]Let's take a look.
[57:33.54]This broken gumball machine always makes me wistfully nostalgic for earlier times.
[57:38.14]Like that time we smashed this gumball machine!
[57:40.43]That was great!
[57:41.99]Did I smash the gumball machine last season?
[57:45.17]I don't really remember doing that.
[57:48.09]Oh, there's Abe Lincoln!
[57:52.22]One of Bosco's discarded Giga Guzzler soda cups.
[57:55.36]The only drink affected by the position of the moon.
[58:00.35]Four square and seven brides ago.
[58:02.31]It's a sculpture of Abe Lincoln's head.
[58:04.11]Sheesh, what will it take to get rid of that guy?
[58:07.68]He's not a real guy, Max.
[58:09.38]I can't be positive, but it seems to be made out of pudding?
[58:13.24]Is it the annual citywide pudding festival already?
[58:15.60]I feel unprepared.
[58:22.42]Mole man construction worker.
[58:23.98]Either you guys seen Charlie?
[58:25.88]He was supposed to be back by now.
[58:28.74]Charlie?
[58:30.95]I can't say I've seen Charlie.
[58:32.37]Anything else?
[58:34.27]No, I already did that.
[58:40.43]There are the cartridges.
[58:41.17]Okay.
[58:59.86]Uh, let's... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[59:00.90]The carriage.
[59:05.40]Rosemary keeps wandering off and leaving this thing behind.
[59:07.96]I want some more coffee.
[59:13.35]I could, like, brew some coffee.
[59:23.27]Just regular coffee.
[59:29.38]Alright, um... So he's got that, like, demon water.
[59:34.51]Let me go back in here and not laugh at chat making references to ants.
[59:45.00]Let's go back and talk to you.
[59:46.42]Alright, so you got demon broth.
[59:50.01]Let me listen to this again.
[59:50.79]What's so great about that demon broth anyway?
[59:53.45]What's great is that it's nutrient rich.
[59:56.66]That it's mine and that I'm not letting you two parasites anywhere near it.
[60:00.32]Nutrient rich.
[60:01.08]Once I've perfected this recipe, I'll never need to worry about money again.
[60:05.98]We're going to make another person out of this broth.
[60:09.28]Isn't it kind of overkill to have a radio and a jukebox?
[60:12.74]Anything to drown out the noise my granddaughter calls music.
[60:17.34]It ruins the digestion.
[60:19.84]Okay.
[60:19.96]You got more.
[60:20.44]WSNT.
[60:43.93]Okay.
[60:44.73]Remember that station.
[60:46.17]W-S-N-T.
[60:47.37]Probably gonna need it.
[60:48.17]Aw, you and girl Stinky will be working like a mullman oiled machine in no time.
[60:52.72]Mark my words, boyo.
[60:54.96]Boyo?
[60:56.28]Do people really say that, Sam?
[60:58.28]That woman will be the death of me.
[61:01.23]That's the idea.
[61:05.08]Can't you and girl Stinky just get along?
[61:07.20]All this negative energy is bad for my psychic balance.
[61:09.69]She's the one locking a master chef like me out of his own kitchen.
[61:16.18]It won't be a problem after I perfect me recipe and make me fortune.
[61:25.48]I figured it out.
[61:25.94]He's got a whipped cream beard on.
[61:27.00]Boy, Grandpa Stinky, I sure am glad to see you back working in this diner again after returning from a long time away to work with your granddaughter, who's also coincidentally named Stinky.
[61:36.97]Was all that really necessary?
[61:39.47]Sorry, Max is all short-term memory.
[61:41.70]I have to bring him back up to speed every once in a while.
[61:43.96]Ah!
[61:45.12]Giant talking dog!
[61:49.13]So can I use the psychic powers?
[61:51.05]It's been all I can do just to turn this back into a place that lures decent people in to eat.
[61:57.58]The carefully placed rack droppings are one of those flourishes you don't notice until they're missing.
[62:02.02]Did you see all the decoration she scattered about?
[62:05.58]Rubbish!
[62:06.68]At least then we had some customers.
[62:09.91]Aye, you really appeal to the lucrative insect and talking statue demographic, I'll give you that.
[62:18.89]Alright, do you know anything about Skunk Ape?
[62:20.67]As part of the freelance neighborhood watch, we're warning everybody about an alien gorilla on the street.
[62:25.91]General Skunk Ape?
[62:27.83]We'd do well to have more of his kind in this neighborhood instead of these shiftless layabouts loitering around until somebody comes to ask them questions.
[62:38.06]No, are we gonna... Are we gonna have to do another election thing?
[62:41.24]Do we have to defend our presidential championship belt?
[62:57.90]just be careful around skunk ape ah you just don't trust him because he's no human uh what he's welcome here any time my granddaughter could do a lot worse than to court a magnificent specimen like general skunk copy ew gross okay so alright sam pull out some of the uh what was that
[63:27.79]Activate future vision.
[63:32.35]On the demon broth, right?
[63:37.32]Does he do it?
[63:41.98]What does he do?
[63:44.36]Hit the lottery or something?
[63:57.08]We interrupt this program for a breaking news bulletin.
[64:00.04]Officials for the city's $700 million lottery jackpot drawing have announced that there is one winning ticket sold to unemployed and somewhat pathetic Molopolis resident, Harry Molman.
[64:10.55]Okay, so Harry Molman, we gotta get the ticket from Harry Molman and get to here and then take the broth.
[64:23.71]Alright, so, first of all, we've got Harry Moleman wins the lottery in the future.
[64:27.69]He gets the money, somehow, or doesn't care about this anymore.
[64:55.26]So now, is there anything else I can do?
[64:59.32]What's that?
[65:00.60]Alright, what about you, Sam?
[65:02.64]Wow!
[65:03.46]Would you look at that, Max?
[65:04.96]Amazing!
[65:06.94]What button?
[65:07.30]Did you just press a button?
[65:08.82]There's a button underneath?
[65:09.90]I didn't know there was a secret button.
[65:20.59]Alright, so... Okay.
[65:22.47]Okay.
[65:25.03]Let's get out of here.
[65:32.40]I think I have to... Alright, let's go find Harry Moment.
[65:41.24]Whoa, a button.
[65:43.14]I know, right?
[65:46.19]This phone only accepts Dutch Gilder coins.
[65:48.95]Sorry, Sam.
[65:49.83]All I've got are some yuan, a few euros, and six bucks in Italian lira.
[65:54.28]Alright.
[65:54.54]Appreciate aquarium.
[65:55.32]I need to do that first.
[65:56.82]Okay.
[66:20.46]So, I have one piece of the puzzle there.
[66:22.16]We need a lottery ticket.
[66:23.32]A winning lottery ticket.
[66:30.85]I didn't skip that.
[66:33.13]So, Harry's not down there.
[66:34.97]Let's just... Okay, we need to talk to this guy first.
[66:39.18]He's... Okay, he's interviewing him.
[66:40.96]There's like an interview going on.
[66:42.26]Oh, never mind.
[66:43.00]Hello, sir.
[66:43.74]Mr. President.
[66:50.87]President?
[66:52.47]You are the ruler of this planet?
[66:55.19]Oh no, I'm just President of the United States.
[66:57.75]We're only one of many United Nations working together to achieve... We're alone here, sir.
[67:01.91]You can speak freely.
[67:02.75]Oh, okay.
[67:04.17]Yeah, I'm in charge, pretty much.
[67:06.21]Perfect.
[67:07.55]Just the one I wanted to see.
[67:10.97]Keep the hands where we can see them, pal.
[67:14.36]What's the catch?
[67:15.04]Artifact?
[67:16.10]Demon broth?
[67:50.95]What's this about an artifact?
[67:53.25]It is the eyes of Yog-Sogoth.
[67:56.45]One of hundreds of magical toys scattered throughout the galaxy by the great comet.
[68:02.65]It's believed to give the holder the power to see the future.
[68:05.07]What a coincidence!
[68:06.15]I was just- He was just saying how he wished he could see the future, so he and I would stop showing up to work wearing the same thing.
[68:12.63]It gets pretty awkward.
[68:16.11]Okay, so we have it.
[68:18.08]You're looking for the thing that we have.
[68:21.64]So, about this artifact.
[68:23.54]Yes.
[68:24.50]You have found it?
[68:25.90]Not as far as you know, but just for fun.
[68:28.01]Why is it so important to you?
[68:30.11]It's a legendary treasure, said to give the wielder the power to predict his enemy's every movement, manipulate the economies and governments of weaker worlds, avoid death, find complex solutions to puzzles using unconventional combinations of everyday items, and crush anyone who stands in his way!
[68:52.42]But that's all just a myth.
[68:56.46]I would simply give it away to my nephew in Canada.
[69:06.03]Alright.
[69:07.67]Just wondering, how much do you pay for security on a ship like that?
[69:11.55]Security?
[69:13.11]You know, laser grids, explosive time locks, that kind of thing.
[69:16.47]We can go in the spaceship?
[69:19.73]Need anything?
[69:34.45]So we can just walk right on your spaceship whenever we want?
[69:38.45]Of course.
[69:39.75]The miracles of my technology are welcome to everyone, especially to your planet's mole people.
[69:48.88]Really?
[69:49.20]Hmm.
[69:52.28]Harry, we're going to take a vacation.
[69:54.98]What's the story behind your whole mole man fixation?
[70:00.12]It's no fixation.
[70:02.72]General Skunkape is a friend to all creatures of the galaxy, from the greatest ape to the tiniest, most insignificant and pitiable mole-man.
[70:15.86]Hey, we know the most insignificant and pitiable mole-man!
[70:20.07]On every planet I visit, all of the local mole people are invited to ride my fantastic gamma beam to a wonderful off-world vacation they'll never forget.
[70:32.60]I don't kill them.
[70:35.50]Okay, I was just gonna say, what is that even... what's that supposed to mean?
[70:39.96]Where are these fabulous off-world vacations exactly?
[70:43.31]Why, any planet you can imagine.
[70:47.70]Pluto?
[70:48.84]That's not a planet, Max.
[70:50.40]It is.
[70:50.54]Yes, it is.
[70:50.80]A planet of nubile Amazon priestesses bathing in rivers of chocolate and toffee?
[70:54.76]They made it a planet again.
[70:55.80]Sure.
[70:56.68]Why not?
[70:59.70]Didn't they go back on that?
[71:03.43]No, it's not.
[71:03.81]I thought they went back on that.
[71:13.17]Does the General want a banana?
[71:15.45]I see.
[71:16.65]Because I resemble your Earth gorillas, you assume I want a banana.
[71:21.40]I'm glad to see that Earthlings are still so charmingly racist.
[71:26.22]Relax, buddy.
[71:26.98]We're just making sure you're getting enough potassium.
[71:32.20]You're not from around here, are you?
[71:34.20]Guilty.
[71:35.10]You could tell by the accent, right?
[71:38.21]No, I have traveled from a planet hundreds of light years away from your own.
[71:45.33]It was once a beautiful, swampy and muggy world, the air dancing with swarms of mosquitoes, the stillness of the nights punctuated only by the mewling of infants and the drunken revelries of toothless secessionists.
[72:04.40]Its name would be impossible for your Earth tongues to pronounce, but my people know it as Pensacola.
[72:14.98]Pensacola.
[72:18.49]What are you doing here, Agent Superball?
[72:21.05]As you know, sirs, when you appointed me Secretary of the Posterior, that placed me in command of the Department of Homeworld Security.
[72:27.35]I didn't know we had one of those.
[72:28.89]Did you, Max?
[72:29.95]Heck if I know.
[72:30.95]As soon as they gave me a button that shoots ballistic missiles and a hotline to Mila Jovovich, I lost interest in everything else.
[72:36.33]Well, I investigate visitations from aliens, abductions, violations of the time stream, lost continents, myth and legends, that kind of thing.
[72:45.95]Superball!
[72:50.00]What's the homeworld security threat level, Superball?
[72:54.48]Area 51.
[72:59.78]So you're planning to just find your magic toy and leave the planet peacefully, right?
[73:04.10]The Earth's Chamber of Commerce has a selection of coupons for discounted dining and entertainment during your stay.
[73:09.76]Find my toy and leave?
[73:12.38]Of course not!
[73:13.96]Don't let him snap.
[73:38.01]Yeah, because you don't want to be listening to music.
[73:41.87]And I know what you mean by that.
[73:44.99]We don't talk about movies.
[73:46.71]Alright, we'll let you know if we find that artifact.
[73:50.12]After clearing it through the Department of Homeworld Security first.
[73:53.16]Just a formality.
[73:54.48]Go in peace.
[73:58.54]Alright, let's go on the ship.
[74:03.95]It's General Skunk Ape's horrible spaceship.
[74:06.45]Good likeness.
[74:07.63]Oh, by the way, Pluto is currently being discussed to become a planet again.
[74:12.04]It's like new from like January 2019.
[74:14.08]Look it up.
[74:16.32]This place looks eerily familiar.
[74:18.64]Check it out, Max.
[74:19.81]The control center for invaders from distant stars.
[74:22.93]Yeah, yeah.
[74:23.61]Alien spaceship.
[74:24.55]Seen it.
[74:25.35]I just want to get to the part where I have those sweet psychic powers.
[74:28.35]Pfft.
[74:33.08]He's dead.
[74:33.44]Yeah, I live in Vegas, so I'm gonna go down to the, like, casino and be like, hey, can I put, like, a bet down if Pluto's gonna be a planet again in, like, a year or two?
[74:41.01]I'm gonna win, like, a hundred million dollars.
[75:03.46]Hmm, I wonder, what was that, a dolphin?
[75:30.37]Skip the whole game.
[75:31.31]Where are you?
[75:55.79]You did it, Sam and Max.
[75:57.59]You awakened me from the sleep of 100 deaths.
[76:02.13]How did you do it?
[76:03.41]Easy peasy.
[76:04.55]All it took was Stinky's demon broth and Mama Bosco's futuristic power core.
[76:09.78]Okay.
[76:10.04]Well, you heard the mean little buddy.
[76:11.02]We got the materials.
[76:11.68]We've got to find some demon broth and Mama Bosco's futuristic power core.
[76:18.06]Okay, need.
[76:18.82]What else do I need?
[76:24.95]So we just have to bring those two things in here?
[76:27.01]What about that?
[76:29.47]Hey, it's all my stuff.
[76:33.58]It's all my stuff.
[76:38.06]Okay, what else is there to look at?
[76:40.72]Anything else?
[76:44.46]We need Mama Bosco's power core.
[76:48.52]And the demon broth.
[76:50.80]And we know how to get the demon broth.
[76:55.48]congratulations this is him going on vacation does he win the hundred million dollars and then okay congratulations you're gonna get like sucked through a tube and be put on it's definitely like they definitely kill him or something has to be okay
[77:25.19]Uh, let's get back out of here.
[77:30.54]Let me look at this door.
[77:31.36]I'm gonna be a big winner.
[77:40.62]Congratulations!
[77:42.82]Hey pal, we want to ask you... I've been listening to suits like you for too long already.
[77:46.94]You can dig your own tunnels now, while I enjoy an all-expenses-paid off-world vacation.
[77:52.86]So long, suckers!
[77:56.00]Yeah, alright, so they definitely like a... Yeah, they like grind them up into like power or something.
[78:04.08]They get power from the moment.
[78:06.24]And that is why we're doing a staycation this year.
[78:14.06]What do we have?
[78:16.04]Oh, there's a mining helmet.
[78:19.64]Weird.
[78:20.34]There's a hard hat and some kind of vacation ticket.
[78:23.99]All the personal effects confiscated from our fuel resources are collected and donated to various intergalactic Mole Man charities.
[78:32.63]What a nice gesture.
[78:34.09]We should leave it for when that Mole Man gets back, Sam.
[78:36.95]I think he, uh, went to live on a farm to play with other Mole Men.
[78:46.36]No such luck.
[78:49.86]So did I get anything?
[78:50.68]Okay.
[78:51.28]So I got the hard hat.
[78:54.02]I got the off-world vacation ticket.
[78:57.89]Alright.
[78:59.29]So I'm gonna have to give that to Harry.
[79:00.89]Are we actually gonna kill Harry?
[79:04.67]That seems kind of mean.
[79:10.53]I need to save the game.
[79:11.83]Is it already... Okay, there's an auto-save.
[79:13.49]I was making sure there was an auto-save, and there is.
[79:15.91]What about this?
[79:18.97]It's empty.
[79:21.05]Nothing in it.
[79:23.51]Let's go back down.
[79:33.13]Any other things in the spaceship?
[79:36.39]Should I put on the future glasses?
[79:38.65]I was going to say goggles, but there are goggles.
[79:43.87]Uh, no, hold on.
[79:46.95]Put them on.
[79:49.19]Anything in here?
[79:57.14]With the cell, the... Alright, no, no, no.
[80:00.72]What about down here?
[80:01.44]Easy.
[80:12.81]I sure hope that alien brain appreciates all the trouble we're going through to bring him back to life.
[80:20.58]You know how those intellectuals are.
[80:21.88]They'll probably start bragging that he doesn't own a TV.
[80:28.02]You ever worry that your future vision was just a big misunderstanding and Skunk Ape turns out to be a good guy after all?
[80:34.37]Worrying is for lesser creatures, Sam.
[80:36.87]I'm a highly advanced psychic being, the next stage in our evolution.
[80:41.35]Well, when you put it like that, I can't help but be even more terrified.
[80:44.83]Alright, let's keep going.
[80:47.29]See you, Max.
[80:48.33]Keep in touch!
[80:49.25]Out the door.
[80:56.96]So, I need Demon Broth.
[80:57.90]I need Mama Bosco's Core.
[81:04.57]Alright, well, there's a new development.
[81:10.29]Let me see.
[81:11.09]Can I go into Bosco's?
[81:12.75]Bosco Tech Labs.
[81:14.29]Visit our new location.
[81:16.46]Oh, so Mama Bosco's too good to haunt our street anymore?
[81:20.06]Well, this is kind of a bad neighborhood to be a ghost.
[81:22.66]All the best cemeteries are on the other side of town.
[81:26.20]So let me... Let me future this up.
[81:35.79]Anything out here?
[81:36.37]I feel like I should use it here.
[81:38.33]Yeah, alright.
[81:38.91]Well, we got Sybil's boxes.
[81:46.09]Oh, okay.
[81:46.97]I get it.
[81:47.97]Nothing changes.
[81:48.77]They just are still here.
[81:50.05]Okay.
[81:58.89]Yes, I am using this in front of him.
[82:04.76]The thing eventually takes off, but hold on.
[82:06.82]What's this?
[82:07.32]Sam and Max save Earth from alien invader.
[82:09.78]Aw, I gave away the ending.
[82:17.48]Anything else to look at?
[82:18.54]I just want to see it all.
[82:21.38]Yep.
[82:22.56]Gee, little buddy.
[82:23.58]Here in 2109, our street looks pretty much the same as it did a hundred years ago.
[82:27.99]Keep moving, Earthling.
[82:30.09]Emperor Skankape II has demanded tribute.
[82:33.05]You used to be so much cooler, Max.
[82:35.35]Here, you're not you when you're hungry.
[82:37.31]Have an ant Snickers.
[82:42.82]See you wherever that is, then, my love.
[82:48.90]What the fuck?
[82:49.72]Alright, nothing else to see here.
[83:03.62]Pull it out.
[83:08.16]So, this is the new address.
[83:09.22]Visit us at our new location, 5th and 43rd D. Alright.
[83:16.06]Can I drive there?
[83:16.91]Well, there's still more to do.
[83:18.19]Hold on.
[83:19.71]Did you remember to feed the parking meter, Max?
[83:22.05]Can't do anything with the rats?
[83:36.37]Hello and welcome to a bold new reimagining of the Computer Obsolescence Prevention Society.
[83:43.25]Are they all just stuffed in here?
[83:49.88]What are you doing in our car?
[83:51.52]I said you guys could hang out in our car until you found your own place, but it's been months now.
[83:55.92]You have been randomly selected to enjoy a free trial of the Crime-Tron XL at no cost to you.
[84:05.03]Okay.
[84:06.13]Do you guys know where to find... Where's a power core?
[84:13.04]What's his problem?
[84:14.06]We were forced to witness Mama Bosco tearing apart circuit boards to construct her power core.
[84:19.24]We prefer not to talk about it.
[84:21.58]It was horrible.
[84:27.28]How are you guys supposed to help us fight crime?
[84:29.62]Yeah, you're not even as powerful as a cell phone.
[84:32.59]that was completely uncalled for.
[84:34.47]With my 16MHZ of raw power, I am able to analyze data at speeds rivaling the most advanced pocket calculators.
[84:45.17]Ow.
[84:45.27]What do you do?
[84:46.43]I'm a functional telephone, and that's about it.
[84:52.93]What happened to that Bluster Blaster machine you used to hang out with?
[84:56.39]He has traveled with user Vasco to Las Vegas, Nevada.
[85:00.75]What's an outdated arcade machine supposed to do in Vegas?
[85:03.43]He doesn't even have any money.
[85:04.70]Bluster Blaster received a generous workers' compensation settlement upon his termination from Pimplica.
[85:11.34]We cannot comment while litigation is pending.
[85:16.36]He's here.
[85:17.16]He's here now.
[85:21.86]You guys should keep an eye on General Skunk.
[85:23.76]He's right behind you.
[85:25.34]He's evil.
[85:26.00]That guy is a total heat sink.
[85:30.94]A real motherboard.
[85:32.54]We thought everybody else liked him except for us.
[85:34.53]His so-called advanced technology is going to make thousands of hard-working computers and robots lose their jobs.
[85:42.17]When buying technology, look for the made-on-Earth label.
[85:49.98]Okay, what's this business about a free trial?
[85:52.82]You have selected to hear more about the Crimetron XL.
[85:56.70]In a world where thugs and supervillains rule the streets, only the most technologically advanced Crimestoppers will emerge victorious.
[86:06.05]Submit clues gathered from your investigations and we will analyze the living hell out of them.
[86:13.86]Okay.
[86:14.86]Let's try out the Crimetron right now.
[86:16.93]We're sorry, the Crimetron XL may not yet be available in some areas.
[86:22.71]We are still recruiting members for the COPS.
[86:28.94]For the last time, we are not letting your Japanese robot dog into this group.
[86:34.26]We talked about this.
[86:35.80]That dog is straight up creepy.
[86:40.30]Can I drive the car?
[86:40.78]If talking to you guys is great and all, but could we have our car back?
[86:43.64]If you'd like to drive somewhere, use the handy city map contained in the glove box.
[86:47.62]Thank you.
[86:48.68]Hey, Sam, isn't our car still possessed by demons?
[86:51.81]It is not so bad as long as you do not try to run the air conditioner.
[86:56.39]Okay.
[86:59.77]So give me the map.
[87:01.31]If talking to you guys is great... If you'd like to drive somewhere, use the handy city map contained...
[87:08.83]Don't have to, like, be out of the... Can I pull it out?
[87:14.54]Make a phone call.
[87:16.38]Drop... Okay.
[87:17.92]Drive somewhere.
[87:21.00]Alright, Bosco Tech Lab.
[87:23.50]Let's go get that power cord.
[87:32.46]So Bosco's mom is here.
[87:40.06]What else is out here?
[87:42.80]What's in the banner?
[87:45.48]Okay.
[87:45.72]Might as well take a look.
[87:56.90]Ooh, there's a lot.
[88:02.52]Nothing over there.
[88:03.04]What about the banner?
[88:04.22]Two in one blow.
[88:11.89]I'm being strangled.
[88:18.36]Well, that knocked him out cold.
[88:20.20]Do it again!
[88:20.82]Do it again!
[88:21.92]I'm getting pieces of the story here in random order.
[88:28.84]Okay.
[88:34.69]Nothing else.
[88:35.11]Who's just floating around here?
[88:42.37]Okay.
[88:44.85]No, I already took care of that before we left.
[88:46.93]I'll go this way.
[88:56.86]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[88:57.50]Hello, lamppost.
[88:58.37]Whatcha knowin'?
[88:59.03]Does he talk now?
[89:02.33]Sheesh, what a jerk.
[89:07.57]There's stuff over here.
[89:09.79]Can I go up?
[89:10.41]Okay, I can go up the ladder.
[89:12.31]Wait.
[89:19.64]Didn't I put it on over here?
[89:25.44]Yeah, I was just going to climb that.
[89:27.08]That's what I was just going to do.
[89:27.96]I don't need you to tell me that, future.
[89:30.90]Just climb it.
[89:33.00]Look, I'm going to get strangled in front of it.
[89:36.23]No, I'm not.
[89:43.13]I saw the future and I wanted to play out differently.
[89:48.29]Mama Bosco?
[89:52.14]Get out.
[89:54.02]What the fuck?
[89:58.52]Get out of here.
[89:59.98]It's Sam and Max.
[90:08.24]Uh, hiya, Harry.
[90:10.02]We were looking for Mama Bosco.
[90:11.72]Do not be afraid.
[90:13.74]Mama Bosco has passed on to the other realms.
[90:17.12]But I shall attempt to establish a link to... Oh, there she is.
[90:21.27]Hey, good-looking.
[90:23.61]Give him the pass.
[90:24.53]So he gets liquidated or whatever they do to him.
[90:34.04]Mama Bosco sends greetings from the Ethereal Plains.
[90:39.02]Welcome to the labs.
[90:40.28]You're my first visitor.
[90:42.24]Wait.
[90:43.34]I was your first visitor.
[90:45.24]Right.
[90:48.99]Oh, no, no.
[90:51.29]He needs to win the lottery.
[90:52.11]Alright.
[90:58.11]We've got telephone.
[90:59.03]Game has been saved.
[91:00.33]We've got a lot of random things here to do.
[91:02.45]No outgoing calls, alright.
[91:27.95]A skeleton painting.
[91:32.61]What the fuck?
[91:33.73]Okay.
[91:34.31]Anything else?
[91:40.40]Should I turn on the future glasses?
[91:44.72]Not yet.
[91:51.28]Thankfully, I do have the item that he needs.
[91:53.94]Ectoplasm.
[91:54.58]What's that?
[91:55.54]Hey, neat.
[91:56.48]The eerie oozing remains of Mama Bosco's ghostly visitations.
[92:00.78]Oh, that must be ectoplasmic jelly, because ectoplasmic jam don't shake like that.
[92:06.39]Hold on.
[92:08.05]Did... Did Max just say that there was a difference between jelly and jam?
[92:14.35]That jelly is not jam?
[92:20.47]Interesting.
[92:21.21]Wow.
[92:22.33]I didn't even have to say that.
[92:28.15]Can I take it?
[92:28.53]Can I pick it up?
[92:31.71]You get two of them, I guess.
[92:59.47]Alright.
[93:01.16]Look at weird... I love that description.
[93:03.04]Look at weird ball thing.
[93:04.40]I can't tell if that's something Mama Bosco invented or an award Mama Bosco got for inventing something.
[93:09.36]Either way, it's pretty impressive.
[93:17.49]If these findings are true, then that would mean it's scientifically impossible for Max and me to exist.
[93:27.30]Oh, no, wait.
[93:28.34]I was reading it wrong.
[93:32.55]Okay, let's take out the future thing.
[93:35.59]Ectoplasm?
[93:41.09]No.
[93:44.05]Well, Harry...
[93:45.45]Thanks, Sam and Max.
[93:46.73]This is exactly what I need to turn my life around.
[93:49.76]Harry's got a great, big, wonderful surprise waiting for him.
[93:54.26]And to think all it took was this.
[93:56.88]Are you sure you can't make those future visions last a little longer, Max?
[94:00.44]That's the card.
[94:00.96]I would take all the fun out of it.
[94:02.98]So the future visions seem to be almost like the hint system.
[94:10.00]Kind of.
[94:10.34]Because I know I'm going to give him the vacation card.
[94:14.34]Or lottery, whatever.
[94:15.38]Okay, so Flint finds the power core.
[94:16.58]Yeah.
[94:16.68]Alright.
[94:16.90]So that's that.
[94:17.64]What about on Mama Bosco?
[94:19.40]No, so it's all the same.
[94:46.47]Alright, so we need to find a way to get... Let's just go talk to Harry.
[94:50.05]Wait.
[94:50.75]So long, suckers!
[94:52.71]Prepare yourselves, mole women of outer space!
[94:55.26]The Love Digger is on his way!
[94:57.54]Yeah, it's the card.
[95:01.08]Harry, come here.
[95:07.23]Hi, Harry.
[95:08.57]Let's talk.
[95:09.81]I'm sensing that you want to ask me some questions.
[95:16.32]Wait, lottery or vacation ticket?
[95:21.18]Because... I need to get the demon broth.
[95:24.52]So... If I just kill him right now, he's just dead.
[95:29.91]If money's tight, maybe you should try the lottery.
[95:32.79]I've got a really good feeling about your chances this time.
[95:35.53]And then he's gonna have a winning ticket on him.
[95:37.59]Unemployed losers who don't understand how numbers work.
[95:40.71]And then we liquidate him.
[95:41.35]So how many tickets have you bought?
[95:42.39]Twelve.
[95:44.09]No, eight.
[95:45.45]One.
[95:47.77]Okay.
[95:50.23]The winning ticket's gonna be in his personal belongings, so... How do we do the lottery drawing, though?
[95:56.19]That's the question.
[95:57.13]Are you sure that you're compatible with Mama Bosco?
[96:01.06]Of course!
[96:02.16]I've been blessed with the unique ability to communicate with the recently deceased!
[96:07.38]Only you can see me, huh?
[96:09.56]How many fingers am I holding up?
[96:11.76]Only one!
[96:12.22]Ha!
[96:12.44]See?
[96:12.54]I...
[96:18.58]Okay, well... You know, Harry, we can all see and hear Mama Bosco.
[96:23.13]That's just a manifestation of the unconscious... Oh, who am I kidding?
[96:28.55]You're right.
[96:29.63]I'm just useless.
[96:31.73]Come on, Harry.
[96:32.75]You're not just useless.
[96:34.13]I'll get that lottery ticket.
[96:35.37]You're totally useless.
[96:39.59]What are you doing here, Harry?
[96:41.05]I'm working as Mama Bosco's lab assistant.
[96:44.09]I never hired him.
[96:45.33]And she says I'm perfect for the job.
[96:47.81]But you don't know anything about science.
[96:49.93]Or hygiene!
[96:51.13]Which means I'll never go mad and take over the lab for my own twisted experiments.
[96:55.46]I'm perfect!
[96:58.96]That's not a... You're not wrong.
[97:02.64]I thought you already had a job.
[97:04.70]Apparently, there was some kind of power shakeup.
[97:07.20]I got laid off.
[97:08.78]You guys aren't looking for another partner, are you?
[97:12.39]We'll keep your resume on file in case there's an opening.
[97:15.33]Let's liquidate him.
[97:15.99]Money's tight.
[97:18.63]I've got a... The lottery's just for unemployed losers who don't... So how many tickets have you bought?
[97:24.19]Twelve.
[97:25.91]No, wait.
[97:26.74]One.
[97:27.28]Yeah, see you later.
[97:28.50]Here, you just want a vacation.
[97:29.70]Did you hear about General Skunk Ape's fabulous off-world vacations?
[97:33.44]What Mole Man hasn't heard about it.
[97:35.50]It's the talk of the five boroughs.
[97:37.36]Why don't you go try it out?
[97:39.46]I was at a job interview and they gave out the tickets.
[97:42.11]By the time I got back, it was already too late.
[97:45.93]Well, I've got some news for you.
[97:49.39]If you can talk to the dead, maybe you know about psychic powers?
[97:53.13]Sam's worried about my brain because I can see the future now.
[97:56.29]Psychic powers?
[97:57.62]There's no such thing.
[97:58.96]They just made that up to sell documentary TV series back in the 70s.
[98:03.24]See, Sam?
[98:04.02]There's nothing to worry about.
[98:06.78]Unless they're caused by a giant deadly tumor.
[98:09.12]Okay.
[98:11.95]See you around, Harry.
[98:12.97]And cheer up.
[98:14.17]You'll get what's coming to you.
[98:15.95]That's what I'm afraid of.
[98:17.73]And ghosts.
[98:18.33]I kind of feel bad about this, but here.
[98:21.87]Here you go, Harry.
[98:26.71]I'll take that lottery ticket, please.
[98:27.71]I know what would cheer you up, Harry.
[98:28.97]An all-expenses-paid vacation.
[98:31.23]You actually have one of Skunkopi's golden tickets?
[98:35.51]Well, that's a nice gesture, but I don't take charity.
[98:38.32]What?
[98:38.54]I'd have to give you something in return.
[98:40.88]Uh, you wouldn't happen to have a lottery ticket, would you?
[98:44.34]Well, sure, I buy one every week, but it's worthless.
[98:47.00]I never win anything.
[98:48.46]I mean, uh, it's incredibly valuable to me.
[98:52.34]I don't know if I could part with it.
[98:55.00]Okay, then.
[98:55.66]See you, Harry.
[98:56.74]Wait, I can part with it.
[98:58.04]Just give me that vacation ticket.
[99:02.39]Alright, we got the ticket.
[99:14.90]Let's make this happen.
[99:17.94]Use Mole Man Tunnel?
[99:19.14]Harry must have dug his way in here.
[99:21.12]They say they don't like to be in bright sunlight, but I say it's just an excuse to do more property damage.
[99:26.37]A brilliant excuse!
[99:27.51]Hey, Max.
[99:28.53]Why don't you hop in there and see where it leads?
[99:31.42]So you don't want to go in there.
[99:39.69]Alright, let's go back to... Let's give the ticket to Stinky.
[99:46.43]And then watch the fireworks.
[99:49.63]Because I can't... I need to talk to Flint.
[99:52.94]Alright, that's the guy that was here.
[99:55.80]Let's get out of here.
[100:00.95]actually hold on I can what just did I just go up twice it's gonna take some real detective work to track down that missing power core let me yeah I'll talk to her crawl into the mole man's hole what can I do for you boys
[100:23.11]Alright, power core.
[100:24.47]Do you happen to know anything about a power core?
[100:26.59]Where did we get it?
[100:27.17]Where did you hear about that?
[100:29.81]From magazines?
[100:32.89]About pamphlets?
[100:36.73]Where's Bosco?
[100:37.47]I had a power core stolen from my lab.
[100:41.78]You did?
[100:42.54]Who do you think stole your power core?
[100:44.88]No idea.
[100:46.10]I've got a real detective on the case, though.
[100:49.85]It's a good thing we're trying to steal it, too, or we'd be offended by that remark.
[100:53.77]Couldn't have come at a worse time, either.
[100:55.93]I've almost got my dimensional destabilizer working, but the dimensional rift generator is useless without power.
[101:02.84]Man, if I had a nickel for every time I didn't understand what you just said.
[101:06.36]Okay.
[101:09.02]What did this power core thing look like?
[101:11.16]It looks like a car battery.
[101:11.96]What a question.
[101:12.98]It looks like a power core.
[101:14.94]You know, that's like asking what a Vanderpump particle emulator looks like.
[101:19.79]What is a bander?
[101:21.57]What is a bandicoot?
[101:22.91]Power.
[101:24.07]I don't remember even what she just said.
[101:27.97]The new lab is nice.
[101:30.39]Thanks for saying so, but it needs work.
[101:32.57]Do you have any idea how hard it is to find abandoned real estate in Manhattan that's not already haunted?
[101:38.34]It is a dyer's market.
[101:40.42]I had to start reading the exorcism listings in the paper just to find a lead on this place.
[101:47.49]Okay, where's Bosco?
[101:52.15]I wonder where he is.
[101:58.13]I want to know what his favorite casino is.
[102:02.16]Because I'm just going to go there every day.
[102:05.98]And like sit in the same spot and wait for him.
[102:09.10]And then when he finally shows up, I'm going to be like, I'm going to bump into him.
[102:11.52]Hey, whoa.
[102:12.90]What the fuck?
[102:14.52]Bos- Bosco?
[102:15.82]This is great.
[102:16.44]I'm on vacation right now.
[102:19.06]Have you heard from Bosco?
[102:20.60]He sent a few postcards.
[102:21.94]He and that bluster blaster machine finally made it to Las Vegas.
[102:26.49]I didn't know Bosco liked gambling.
[102:28.43]He said he's got a system.
[102:30.45]Plus 15 billion dollars left over from the money that some idiots gave him for his inventions.
[102:37.10]I'm sure those idiots had very good reasons.
[102:43.73]Did you hear about the alien gorilla that landed on our street?
[102:47.55]Yeah, it came through on the news alert.
[102:49.66]Something about sharing alien technology and ending all poverty and disease on Earth, right?
[102:54.98]Well, yeah, but that's just one part of why he's evil.
[102:59.26]I'm sure he's fine.
[103:00.50]I'm even going to ask him if he can help me finish my dimensional destabilizer.
[103:14.44]I'd be careful around that general skunk ape.
[103:17.26]You two don't trust anybody, do you?
[103:19.68]What do you mean by that?
[103:20.76]Yeah, what are you trying to pull?
[103:23.09]Just wait till he helps me with my inventions.
[103:25.21]Then you'll see he's not such a bad guy.
[103:30.57]Why didn't you just set up your lab in the inconvenience store?
[103:33.64]Not everything happens on your street, Sam.
[103:36.12]Besides, that place isn't zoned for mixed-use haunting.
[103:39.55]They've got guys from the city coming by every day to evict me from this place.
[103:43.59]Only way to get rid of them is by making the walls bleed.
[103:48.56]How's the afterlife treating you, Mrs. Mama Bosco?
[103:51.38]That's Doctor Mama Bosco.
[103:53.46]I spent the summer getting my PhD online.
[103:56.54]Yeah, I started to do that, but I kept getting distracted by all the funny cat pictures.
[104:01.07]You don't know how to use computers, Max.
[104:03.45]What's your doctorate in, Mama Bosco?
[104:05.63]Bridging the trans-dimensional gap to return spirits to their corporeal form.
[104:09.92]My master's was in funny cat pictures.
[104:13.90]Sounds like you're tired of being a ghost.
[104:16.28]Oh, it's not all bad.
[104:17.88]I'm getting better at apparating.
[104:19.51]And now I don't leave a trail of ectoplasmic slime behind every time I leave the room.
[104:24.21]That's better than Sam can say.
[104:26.13]But I'll be glad when I finish my dimensional destabilizer and get my body back.
[104:30.15]Are you guys minus-tuning things that I'm not saying?
[104:32.40]Yeah, touching is my third favorite thing to do to things.
[104:36.44]Uh... In case anyone was curious, second is licking.
[104:41.26]Alright.
[104:47.25]Can we have a separate meter?
[104:51.25]For the other guys here?
[104:52.77]You're a doctor.
[104:53.75]Can you tell us anything about late-onset male psychic dysfunction?
[104:57.86]Psychic powers?
[104:59.20]It's probably a melon-sized deadly tumor.
[105:01.96]Probably?
[105:02.94]Well, it could be mind worms, of course.
[105:05.42]But I don't want to be alarmist.
[105:06.90]Most likely, it's the deadly tumor.
[105:10.48]Couldn't Max just have the perfectly safe kind of non-lethal psychic powers?
[105:15.06]Oh, it's Max.
[105:16.93]I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, then.
[105:19.57]I'm treating it like Reddit gold.
[105:21.43]A little farther away from my machines, though.
[105:25.37]Oh, thanks for the gold.
[105:28.17]Are these psychic powers dangerous for Max at all?
[105:31.16]Well, probably not.
[105:33.17]If he's careful and only uses them responsibly.
[105:35.77]Everything on this stream is my responsibility.
[105:37.79]He'll overwork his brain so much that it catches fire and explodes.
[105:41.83]Oh, I have got to see that.
[105:43.75]You can't see that, Max.
[105:45.17]Your brain will catch fire and explode.
[105:47.45]That's why you'll have to record it for me, Sam.
[105:49.95]Duh.
[105:52.17]It is your stream after all.
[105:53.21]See you on the other side, Dr. Mama Bosco.
[105:55.41]Not if I can get this destabilizer working.
[106:02.95]Alright, so we're good.
[106:04.65]Let's get out of here.
[106:07.53]Just mute the game every time they say a bad joke.
[106:10.06]Well, the subtitle's on.
[106:11.14]You'll read it.
[106:15.48]Every time they say something not funny, I have to say something really funny.
[106:20.68]And every time they say something really funny, I have to say something terrible.
[106:24.61]So the score will even out completely.
[106:28.01]I'll work on it.
[106:32.05]Anything else in here?
[106:38.44]You guys ready to help us fight crime?
[106:40.70]We're still on the search for new recruits.
[106:43.66]If you spot any unused office equipment, be sure to hook a brother up.
[106:49.95]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[106:50.43]What about the... Give me the jump cable.
[106:51.95]...jumper cables?
[106:52.97]Neither of us knows how to use them.
[106:54.75]It's simple, Sam.
[106:56.19]The red cable goes on the right nipple, and the black cable clamps to the... Neither of us knows how to use them legally, Max.
[107:14.34]I'm seeing too many plus twos for that.
[107:20.54]Nah, I'm sorry, guys.
[107:21.56]I gotta bring this down.
[107:22.70]That's not me.
[107:23.24]I didn't do that.
[107:25.50]No, no, no, no.
[107:26.40]I'm sorry.
[107:26.84]Alright.
[107:31.44]Uh... I didn't even do anything yet!
[107:41.27]Alright.
[107:46.91]The name Bosco and science go together like church and state.
[107:50.19]He cares too much about this.
[107:51.81]Alright, so two birds.
[107:56.53]We got two birds with one stone.
[107:57.99]Hold on.
[108:00.73]Pretty cool.
[108:01.71]Not useful, though.
[108:02.45]Let's put on the 3D glasses.
[108:13.12]Well, that knocked him out cold.
[108:14.48]That knocked him out cold.
[108:15.22]Do it again.
[108:15.58]Do it again.
[108:22.05]Somebody just said, I hope his stream goes to minus a thousand one day.
[108:29.73]What?
[108:30.11]You want me to have a really bad stream?
[108:37.93]What?
[108:42.59]Oh, you know what would be great?
[108:44.65]If his stream was fucking terrible.
[108:49.46]I can't wait till it's awful.
[108:53.42]What, so I can take a bath later and, like, sit there crying?
[108:58.55]You want me to have, like, stress over, like, how bad my stream was?
[109:02.03]Why?
[109:15.53]No, I'm not gonna sell.
[109:17.07]Oh my god.
[109:18.17]Why?
[109:27.67]Uh, uh, Jeremy lied about the clown car.
[109:29.49]Gave five community subs.
[109:30.49]Thank you for the five subs.
[109:34.39]Whee!
[109:34.59]This antenna is way too flimsy to support my weight.
[109:37.96]This is pure manipulation.
[109:39.60]I don't even, the score, this is, this is an absolutely nullified score today.
[109:43.72]Absolute manipulation.
[109:47.30]Can I do anything with this?
[109:51.56]No, don't think so.
[109:56.79]You guys have found out how to manipulate the market.
[109:59.00]Let's get it to minus a thousand.
[110:11.73]I can manipulate it too.
[110:13.13]I don't want to say that one.
[110:15.11]I don't want to say that word.
[110:26.11]Okay, I got the jumper cables.
[110:28.94]Let's go back and do Harry Mole Man.
[110:34.12]Aww.
[110:59.50]Turn off the chat!
[111:00.10]Turn off the chat!
[111:00.68]They're trying to do it on purpose.
[111:02.14]How do I turn off chat?
[111:03.50]How do I do streamer only mode?
[111:05.64]Streamer only.
[111:07.24]I don't want mods talking.
[111:09.33]Streamer only mode.
[111:11.47]Streamer only.
[111:14.71]Is there a way to do that?
[111:28.47]How do I, like, is there a way I can turn off the chat?
[111:34.23]There has to be a way, right?
[111:44.70]No, there's no way.
[111:46.98]See, they can't, no, like, you know, they'll keep it in emote only.
[111:48.94]They can't -2 or closer right now.
[111:51.70]But guess what?
[111:53.62]I can.
[111:59.92]Hey mods, you want to do me a favor here?
[112:06.06]Just get it back up to like fucking 200 and where it belongs, please.
[112:12.31]Thank you.
[112:12.65]Oh, when it manipulates the other way, I'm upset about this.
[112:24.90]Oh yeah?
[112:29.86]No, I'm only allowed to manipulate the score!
[112:37.02]Oh fuck, I'm going to jail!
[112:39.44]I'm going to jail for this!
[112:48.37]Alright, alright.
[112:49.41]That's fine, that's fine.
[112:50.51]That's good.
[112:51.53]We can never take it off emote only mode, apparently.
[112:55.59]There's gonna be... There's no way.
[113:02.47]Do you understand what's gonna fucking happen?
[113:05.07]If you take that off?
[113:12.58]It's gonna be an absolute tsunami of -2.
[113:15.30]Yeah.
[113:16.22]This is bad.
[113:19.64]What do I do?
[113:23.55]Um...
[113:27.38]Fuck, I don't know what to do.
[113:28.70]I didn't think that all the way through.
[113:29.98]I got like 35% of the way through that one.
[113:37.28]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[113:38.45]Hey, people can go through the filter!
[113:41.23]People... They have to pay!
[113:43.03]They have to pay money!
[113:52.21]No, that's so stupid.
[113:56.63]25 cents.
[114:05.56]People are subscribing and paying and doing +2 as well.
[114:09.78]Your manipulation tactics won't work.
[114:13.86]You're gonna break, Twitch.
[114:15.90]Settle down.
[114:18.67]It's locked.
[114:19.88]Is this like the biggest long con you've ever seen on stream?
[114:24.91]It could be.
[114:27.85]This could be the biggest like money con.
[114:45.43]It's locked.
[114:46.87]This is gonna fuck up the bit reading at the end so bad I'm gonna have to scroll through all this.
[114:55.44]Nothing.
[114:56.12]Hey, hey!
[114:59.91]What's going on?
[115:00.37]Hey, hey, hey!
[115:01.29]How do I delete that?
[115:03.31]A mod just did -2.
[115:04.49]That's not cool.
[115:08.98]Hold on.
[115:09.96]For, like, the Federal, like, Trade Commission, I need to make sure, like, I do it, too.
[115:13.20]Because, like, then they can look through the records and be like, oh, wait, he sold and blah.
[115:21.48]Oh, my fucking God.
[115:25.87]Alright.
[115:26.13]Alright.
[115:26.47]Alright.
[115:26.83]Turn it off.
[115:27.27]Turn it off.
[115:27.63]Turn it off.
[115:28.05]Turn it off.
[115:28.63]Turn it off.
[115:30.15]I'm willing to accept any responsibility here.
[115:32.15]Turn it off.
[115:46.25]Okay, alright.
[115:46.85]I gotta... What do I have to do?
[115:48.01]Okay, lottery ticket.
[115:51.91]I gotta give this to Stinky.
[116:04.52]I really messed up.
[116:05.66]Yeah, I messed up.
[116:09.95]Today really might be the put-it-on-like-six-hour-slow-mo thing.
[116:13.27]I'm thinking about it.
[116:15.22]That's the only way I can put a piece of gum in the hole of this boat.
[116:26.60]You get to say one chat message.
[116:34.54]Why do I have to pee so bad?
[116:44.05]Stinky's award-winning spaghetti.
[116:45.97]Mentioned in the past five issues of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Journal of Workplace Asset.
[116:50.95]Six-hour slow-mo mystery night.
[116:52.83]You get one chat message.
[116:54.45]Alright.
[116:57.97]Yeah, okay.
[116:58.57]I'm going to go pee.
[117:00.23]And then we're going to come back.
[117:03.05]And everyone's going to be settled down by then.
[117:05.67]And we'll keep going.
[117:07.21]Alright?
[117:08.69]Just everybody chill.
[117:09.97]I got to hold on.
[117:17.25]I know how to fix this.
[117:29.56]Hold on.
[117:29.88]Wait, wait.
[117:30.18]I can fix it.
[117:45.70]Is there no clown videos on YouTube that aren't, like, evil and scary and, like, have blood in them?
[117:50.53]What the fuck?
[117:57.31]A clown on YouTube, it's like, oh, scary clown, like, comes with a chainsaw at me.
[118:04.08]Whatever, I'll be back.
[119:18.77]You know how I know you suck?
[119:19.91]Because your username is isuck247.

[124:31.64]Keep doing it.
[124:32.60]I don't care.
[124:33.18]Oh, this is where he loses it.
[124:52.57]This is where he loses his grip.
[124:55.68]He had, he had chat.

[125:28.76]6,000 times.
[125:30.22]You saw it in video format like five times.
[125:34.22]This is a big difference.
[125:42.71]So, welcome back to Sam and Max, everybody.
[125:46.27]People are really writing emotes.
[125:47.51]Oh, it's emote only mode.
[125:48.57]Right.
[125:48.87]Alright.
[125:53.01]I thought it was over.

[126:08.46]Anytime, fellas.
[126:09.88]Except now.
[126:11.12]Would you look at that?
[126:12.22]Stinky's prize-winning spaghetti.
[126:14.44]A private dick's gotta eat, you know.
[126:21.21]That's it?
[126:21.71]Do you know anything about a missing power core, Flint?
[126:24.45]Give me a break, Sam.
[126:25.99]I haven't eaten a thing since that yak's blood on my Himalayan caper.
[126:28.74]It's being instantly banned.
[126:29.90]And some gummy worms.
[126:31.34]Come back when I'm done eating, would ya?
[126:33.06]Oh, shit.
[126:34.12]People are getting fucking crushed right now.
[126:36.40]Alright, well, easy, easy, easy.
[126:37.79]Hold on.
[126:38.57]Hold on.
[126:39.65]As the king, I demand everyone stop.
[126:43.91]People are getting like banned.
[126:45.62]No, no.
[126:46.74]No more talking.
[126:47.96]No, don't ban anybody.
[126:49.58]No, don't do copy pastes.
[126:52.42]I demand this as the king of this kingdom.
[126:55.84]Oh, fuck.
[126:56.38]The doors are breaking open.
[126:59.42]I'm standing up right now.
[127:01.27]I'm the fucking king, okay?
[127:05.57]This is what happens.
[127:08.13]They're at the front door like...
[127:13.96]Silence!
[127:14.38]I command it!
[127:17.85]Silence!
[127:19.55]I'm holding up like a fucking knife, Flake.
[127:22.61]Quiet!
[127:23.03]This is how you overthrow the king.
[127:35.32]The king is just a guy.
[127:36.82]You understand?
[127:37.92]Oh my god, people are getting, like, banned.
[127:40.46]I have, like, a few, like, knights that have big shields.
[127:44.24]And people are just sprinting.
[127:46.17]Just sprinting into the castle.
[127:48.55]I'm talking, like, full fucking sprint and just, like, body hitting into the shield.
[127:53.13]And, like, go!
[127:54.59]And it's gonna, like, another three or four thousand of you and the shields are gonna go down.
[127:59.07]Area 50.
[128:02.37]Does that imply that I'm the alien?
[128:05.81]In Area 51, why am I the alien?
[128:13.36]Why am I the alien?
[128:16.18]Well, you'll never get me.
[128:17.32]Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[128:26.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[128:33.45]Every time, Salmon Max is supposed to be like, oh, I have an idea.
[128:37.47]How about I chill and play Salmon Max?
[128:42.41]That's like a chill game.
[128:45.01]And people are banging down my fucking kingdom door.
[128:47.29]This always happens when I play Salmon Max.
[128:55.41]That's like the outlier.
[128:56.67]That's the catalyst.
[128:58.22]How many people have been banned in the last 20 minutes?
[129:04.39]I'm so glad I got that.
[129:05.59]I caught it.
[129:06.11]Thank God you didn't see that.
[129:07.77]That was embarrassing.
[129:08.85]It was horrible.
[129:11.23]Anyways.
[129:18.07]Let's go back.
[129:21.17]I need to get the power core.
[129:23.41]Okay.
[129:24.27]Here's what's going to happen.
[129:26.86]Here comes the treaty.
[129:27.72]I'm going to put forth the terms.
[129:29.30]Here's the terms.
[129:30.08]I'm going to make sure I'm on camera for this.
[129:36.19]It's gonna be good.
[129:38.17]These are gonna be good terms, okay?
[129:43.29]Do what I fucking say when I say it.
[129:51.16]What I meant to say was... When... Do... Do what you feel like doing, but under certain rules.
[130:01.25]Okay.
[130:02.01]Okay.
[130:06.11]Don't make me fucking use this.
[130:09.27]Some of the Tudors give subs.
[130:10.87]What do you mean no?
[130:11.59]No, no, you don't agree to those terms?
[130:17.54]They're not agreeing to the terms.
[130:20.62]You have to agree to these terms.
[130:22.14]Otherwise, we can't move on.
[130:23.88]We can't move on with the stream.
[130:25.54]I need to see at least 90% yeas.
[130:31.57]I don't give a shit.
[130:32.41]I'll stick around.
[130:34.05]So...
[130:37.83]I'm gonna turn it on 6 hour slow mode.
[130:42.32]It's gonna happen.
[130:43.96]Get your one chat message ready.
[130:58.03]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if I do this.
[131:01.75]And then it's still that copypasta.
[131:05.27]And then what happens after that is there's nothing after that.
[131:18.82]Can we get some good conversation in here on the one chat message that you get to have?
[131:26.68]Alright, do it.
[131:29.53]Do it!
[131:30.97]Do it!
[131:31.65]Put it on six hour slow mode right now, do it!
[131:42.61]What's wrong with me?
[131:43.35]Don't do that.
[131:45.69]Hope you got your chat messages ready, because we're going to have a civil chat in here.
[131:54.81]And then when that's done, open it up.
[131:57.83]I want to... There you go.
[132:00.51]1800 second slow-mo.
[132:04.01]Hopefully you... Holy shit.
[132:06.45]The power of some of you guys...
[132:10.34]30 minutes is the max.
[132:11.54]Really?
[132:12.22]What the?
[132:12.78]It's alright.
[132:16.94]You're wasting your messages.
[132:18.89]Alright, let it out.
[132:19.87]Let it out.
[132:20.19]Let's see what they have to say.
[132:21.19]Let it out.
[132:21.61]Open it up.
[132:21.99]Let's see what they have to say.
[132:24.67]Let's see.
[132:25.75]Let's see.
[132:26.03]You have 30 minutes.
[132:59.80]one's gonna be able to talk no one's gonna be able to talk then it's gonna be hilarious because what's gonna happen is all this big flood oh like LOL look at the copy pasta and then this is gonna be a 3 300 person stream with like three messages in the chat see some people are really smart about this this is your opportunity
[133:26.44]People, you're holding on to this.
[133:28.10]I'm not going to say shit.
[133:29.30]I'm not going to say shit for like 15 straight minutes.
[133:31.76]And then I'll be the only person in the chat.
[133:33.68]That's a really good.
[133:34.28]Somebody just said spaghetti.
[133:35.66]What a waste.
[133:37.50]You wasted it.
[133:40.95]Poo poo pee pee.
[133:41.57]That's another great one to throw in the trash.
[133:47.85]I want to see what happens in 30 minutes.
[133:50.65]30 minutes from right now, what happens?
[133:53.99]What happened?
[133:54.55]What?
[133:55.13]Oh.
[133:55.99]I just got, like, caught.
[133:56.75]I was like a fish on a hook.
[134:02.01]Okay, fuck that one.
[134:03.87]I'm not reading that one.
[134:09.19]Okay.
[134:13.37]Alright.
[134:13.77]Look, it's slowing down a little.
[134:15.75]We're starting to see the wall come in.
[134:22.08]Oh.
[134:23.22]It's...
[134:24.57]Coming up.
[134:31.35]Oh, look.
[134:33.71]Wait.
[134:37.73]It's normal.
[134:39.73]I can see.
[134:44.90]Let's play Sam & Max.
[134:52.66]Want me to keep the webcam on?
[134:55.84]I'll do it for, like, 15 seconds.
[135:03.30]Yeah, see, those... Here's the thing.
[135:05.80]There are people right now that are typing up their perfect chat message.
[135:10.06]And there's five... Germany lied about the clown car, gave, like, 10, 20 community subs here, didn't they?
[135:14.52]Like, over the last, like, 15 minutes.
[135:18.22]Apologize to chat.
[135:20.54]Apologize for what?
[135:22.32]Having my castle stormed?
[135:33.75]This message was a waste.
[135:35.07]I can't think of a good message.
[135:36.43]It's alright, we'll see you in 30 minutes.
[135:52.32]Somebody just wrote quinoa.
[135:54.52]Alright, what was I doing?
[135:55.28]Do we have a timer?
[135:57.98]When 30 minutes is up?
[135:58.84]I'll know.
[135:59.42]I'll know when 30 minutes is up.
[136:00.66]Because it's going to be a wave of the same coffee pasta.
[136:03.98]That's how I know it's been 30 minutes.
[136:07.82]I'm surprised that there's still this many people able to talk.
[136:11.15]Alright, here's a lottery ticket.
[136:12.77]What is it now?
[136:18.09]Stay cheerful, Grandpa Stinky.
[136:20.73]It's gonna take some real detective work to track down that missing power core.
[136:26.90]Why am I not buff anymore?
[136:30.64]Because I stopped really going to the gym.
[136:32.72]We're all torn up about stealing your patent 30 years ago, Grandpa Stinky.
[136:36.36]Maybe this will make up for it.
[136:38.18]A lottery ticket.
[136:40.66]Don't you know that nobody ever wins these stupid... We interrupt this program for a breaking news bulletin.
[136:46.82]Officials for the city's $700 million lottery jackpot drawing have announced that there is one winning ticket sold to unemployed and somewhat pathetic Molopolis resident Harry Molman.
[136:58.00]This just in, in a surprising upset, we're told that the winning ticket was transferred to local diner owner, Grandpa Stinky.
[137:04.97]Yay, we transferred it over.
[137:05.99]Sorry, Harry Moleman.
[137:07.29]Better luck next time.
[137:09.01]Did you hear that?
[137:10.21]I told you I would win.
[137:13.57]So long, suckers.
[137:15.53]We've been hearing that an awful lot lately.
[137:17.67]What about your super secret demon broth?
[137:20.69]You don't really like a... The worst thing I think ever, ever, ever, and I mean ever,
[137:27.20]like pineapple on pizza is fucking disgusting and like I don't know how do you guys feel about this but like it's it should never be on pizza ever ever ever ever it's fucking horrible it's disgusting and like you should like feel like like you should never order that shit
[137:53.99]Okay.
[137:54.31]Well, that's the quickest way I was able to make people use their chat message.
[137:57.13]That's good.
[138:00.82]Okay.
[138:01.72]Let's keep going.
[138:02.18]So now we get the demon broth, right?
[138:07.48]Oh, sure.
[138:07.68]Blame the demon broth.
[138:25.85]I got the demon broth.
[138:33.69]I'm trying to think of some other opinions that I might have on things.
[138:38.82]The Witcher 3 is not a good game at all.
[138:42.28]I think it should never have received even one award.
[138:46.16]Half-Life, by the way, is like a 4 out of 10, I think, at best.
[138:51.59]Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2.
[138:52.93]Like, I mean, really, that whole company in general just made nothing but, like, 4 to 10 games.
[138:57.72]So, I don't know how you guys feel about that, but... Okay.
[139:09.67]You can tell we're running low!
[139:10.95]You can tell we're running low!
[139:22.29]Any idea when you'll be done eating, Flint?
[139:24.23]Somebody right now heard that.
[139:25.91]Sometime in the future, alright?
[139:27.85]And they're like, I can't believe you fucking said that.
[139:31.84]I wish I could say fuck you, but I can't.
[139:33.84]That's the point.
[139:34.82]No, we're down to less than probably 20 people.
[139:46.36]Okay, so I got the demon broth.
[139:49.82]Now I have to get the power core from you.
[139:53.22]But how do we get this from you?
[139:54.41]Big bits?
[139:56.55]$50 came in from Colonel Zero.
[139:57.83]Haha, Jeremy, I found a loophole.
[139:59.65]Haha.
[140:07.98]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[140:09.02]Somebody says, Hey, Jeremy, I just found your channel.
[140:11.56]You have a very nice community, and as an aspiring Twitch streamer, I'd like to know how you have such a calm chat.
[140:19.40]Well, I mean, hi, welcome.
[140:20.66]Welcome to the channel.
[140:23.02]Thanks for joining us.
[140:24.75]We have, like, our community, we all agree on the same things, and everyone kind of gets it here to just, like, relax and take it easy.
[140:33.03]We usually have, like, a pretty laid-back environment, so that's why it's a little slower.
[140:37.82]People are more respectful, so that's why you're seeing that.
[140:43.86]Except, I mean, some of the person that just wrote, uh, Penis Man.
[140:46.49]That's... You know, sometimes you get a troll or two.
[140:49.15]You know, sometimes you get, like, a troll hater.
[140:50.95]You know, it's just a troll or a hater.
[140:53.05]And, um... That's, like, how it works, though.
[140:57.04]Uh, thank you.
[140:57.54]Jerma is using a walkthrough for five community subs.
[141:02.89]Thank you for the subs, though.
[141:04.11]Appreciate it.
[141:12.27]Any idea when we'll be done eating, Flint?
[141:14.35]Heck, I don't know, Sam.
[141:15.90]Sometime in the future, alright?
[141:27.16]This is like the... I love this.
[141:30.11]Cab Badger just gave $50.
[141:31.49]Thanks for $50.
[141:33.43]And they say, Jerma, dumb, stupid idiot.
[141:36.75]But, like, it's the first time that came.
[141:37.87]Sometimes you get, like, a hater or two.
[141:41.93]Or like 50 or like 100.
[141:43.09]You know, it's a, you know, whatever.
[141:45.79]Troll, it's a troll.
[141:46.60]That's a troll.
[141:47.42]Troll doing that.
[141:53.43]Alright, I have to fucking, let's go.
[141:55.05]I'm too focused on like people here.
[142:07.02]I can't... I'm too involved in you right now.
[142:10.78]I need to be involved in this.
[142:15.39]Stop!
[142:17.19]They can't even talk anyways.
[142:18.59]Just... Who cares?
[142:20.39]They can't even talk anyways.
[142:21.75]What does he say?
[142:22.13]Any idea when you'll be done eating, Flint?
[142:23.99]Heck, I don't know, Sam.
[142:25.53]Sometime in the future, alright?
[142:26.99]Okay, so we've gotta... Dump the demon broth into the spaghetti.
[142:32.74]No, this broth is too important to waste.
[142:40.16]Uh-oh.
[142:43.28]Um... I can't look over a chat and see the answer.
[142:57.08]Because nobody can say it.
[143:00.57]It's, uh...
[143:11.02]If I can do it on my fucking... I don't need any chat members to yell at me.
[143:14.58]Wait!
[143:14.86]Future!
[143:21.98]What happens to the spaghetti?
[143:23.08]What's with his head?
[143:26.38]Somebody hits him in the head with an axe?
[143:40.76]What's this button?
[143:41.66]I can't believe chat is still moving this fast.
[143:50.43]I just got here and saw how dead chat is right now, which is odd.
[143:53.61]And they say anyways, hope you enjoy your stream.
[144:10.03]Alright, let me figure this out.
[144:19.28]I gotta get him... I gotta hit him in the head with an axe.
[144:31.07]Alright, let me... Hold on.
[144:37.28]I can't... It's hard.
[144:38.00]I'm having trouble paying attention to this.
[144:43.39]This is all your fault if you think about it.
[144:45.23]I miss Grandpa Stinky and his blasphemous recipes.
[144:50.12]Does anybody have a timer of how long it's been?
[144:55.26]Hello and welcome to the Televoice Communitron Extreme 5000, with over 800 messaging features available.
[145:03.55]Oh boy, now I can finally set up my 24-hour adults-only naked bunny chat line.
[145:08.15]We're sorry, we've lost my manual for that feature.
[145:12.24]Alright, let's give the call to... Stinky's Diner.
[145:24.62]Let's just get some- let's call someone.
[145:26.12]It's been 17 minutes.
[145:26.94]Okay.
[145:27.28]What happened to Sybil?
[145:28.68]Is she just gone?
[145:49.93]Now the phone's ringing in the boxes.
[145:51.35]Sybil's still on her honeymoon.
[145:52.91]Kind of pointless to try and call her in retrospect.
[145:57.66]Mr. Pizza, I want an extra large thick crust with one half peanut butter and passion fruit, the other half with watermelon only.
[146:04.91]You want cheesy dingles, Max?
[146:06.65]You have to ask.
[146:07.91]Why was that?
[146:09.07]No, three orders of cheesy dingles.
[146:10.49]Why was that?
[146:11.17]Gouda.
[146:11.75]No, three.
[146:13.05]Right.
[146:13.75]An extra fudge sauce.
[146:15.17]Okay, thanks.
[146:16.29]How long till it gets here?
[146:17.77]Probably never, Max.
[146:19.28]Nobody answered.
[146:22.85]You've reached Bosco Tech Labs, the city's leading research facility for scientific breakthroughs with a woman's touch.
[146:30.54]Science and woman's touch are two things you hardly ever hear together.
[146:34.36]I'm dead right now, but feel free to call again later.
[146:39.62]It's too empty.
[146:40.40]It's too empty.
[146:40.84]No, that's fine.
[146:41.88]I have to keep it up.
[146:42.66]Harry's phone has been disconnected.
[146:51.05]I feel like I have 2,000 of you in a jar.
[146:56.41]Keep it on, keep it on.
[146:57.23]Don't take it off.
[146:57.89]This is the, I need this.
[146:59.35]I need this.
[147:00.11]Alright.
[147:16.47]Jumper cables.
[147:17.43]Hard hat.
[147:18.39]Demon broth.
[147:19.05]I need to get him.
[147:20.21]I need to like kill him.
[147:23.61]Who has an axe?
[147:24.59]I haven't been down here.
[147:28.16]Let me go back down here.
[147:42.54]How does it feel to live life as a dwarf?
[147:44.08]It's fucking awesome.
[147:45.44]I'm, like, really, really strong.
[147:47.76]I'm really fun to be around, and I have a ton of gold.
[147:51.17]It's actually kind of great, so thanks for the question.
[148:04.49]Hold on, what about you?
[148:05.59]You're not supposed to bother the construction workers when they're on break, which is always...
[148:16.81]Am I gonna shave my armpits?
[148:18.83]No.
[148:19.47]No, I'm not going to shave my armpits.
[148:23.53]I managed my armpits.
[148:25.61]Why the f- This is what happens when it's too slow.
[148:29.30]We start talking about this.
[148:37.50]It's too far away to see if there's anything interesting and or useful in there.
[148:45.82]Alright.
[148:46.06]I don't know what to do.
[148:48.30]I don't know what to do.
[148:49.06]I know I need to have an accident with the head.
[148:59.27]Timer!
[149:00.61]Time!
[149:02.57]I miss Grandpa Stinky and his blasphemous recipes.
[149:12.52]Book a check?
[149:13.36]Nope.
[149:16.49]impending collapse in five minutes I'm I'm kind of nervous I actually really am I'm like scared of what's gonna happen now I can't pay attention I have to I'm like I know I'm like staring
[149:39.37]At the volcano erupting.
[149:41.05]You know, I can hear it.
[149:42.11]And I'm just sitting there going... I'm close enough where that volcano is gonna fucking... Is gonna land on me.
[149:47.77]It's gonna erupt and it's gonna hit me.
[149:50.26]If I start running right now... As fast as I can... It's still gonna erupt.
[149:55.60]And it's still gonna happen.
[149:58.38]What am I supposed to do?
[150:02.84]Alright, let me talk to... Let me talk to you.
[150:05.93]Important phone call.
[150:06.85]Well, wait a minute!
[150:07.69]Gotta call her!
[150:08.31]So somebody comes in and kills Flint.
[150:10.79]Oh, interesting.
[150:11.21]Okay, so somebody calls... We gotta call you.
[150:37.30]button.
[150:39.14]I gotta get you to leave so I can press the button.
[150:43.84]See you again soon, Stinky.
[150:45.40]Yeah.
[150:46.02]Take your time.
[150:46.72]I got- should I call- but I- didn't I just try to call?
[150:53.40]Okay.
[150:59.11]There's probably an axe that drops down.
[151:02.39]That, like, hits him in the head from that button.
[151:06.57]Okay.
[151:09.44]So, let me try calling again?
[151:11.54]Who calls her?
[151:20.72]This stream has been rad as fuck and I've been twerking.
[151:23.77]I'm glad you're having a fun time doing whatever dance you're doing.
[151:30.59]Let me talk to you.
[151:32.84]No, but my best minions' research assistants are on the case.
[151:38.82]Have you seen it?
[151:41.23]Er, no, but I've got my best Max on the case.
[151:49.09]Not to point fingers or anything, but we couldn't help noticing that disembodied alien brain floating in a jar on board your ship.
[151:55.76]How much do you want for it?
[151:57.04]Joke sucks.
[151:57.66]Fuck you.
[151:58.14]That person just came out.
[151:59.91]That person just came out.
[152:00.75]They were mad for 30 minutes.
[152:02.45]That means it's almost up.
[152:03.79]That means it has to be up.
[152:04.49]That dream is all that remains of my colleague.
[152:07.91]Gordon.
[152:09.23]Joe.
[152:10.37]Hanson.
[152:11.15]Son.
[152:12.17]He fought by my side for many years and gave his life to find the great artifacts.
[152:21.16]He was a great warrior.
[152:23.22]He really had an eye for toys and he was a good friend.
[152:30.82]It's ten minutes?
[152:31.70]Alright, I'm gonna play the game.
[152:36.45]No, there's no hope for him, I'm afraid.
[152:39.25]Remind me in 10 minutes.
[152:40.29]I have to find a replacement.
[152:46.07]Is this making me uncomfortable?
[152:48.49]OK, what if I... What would I do?
[152:50.65]We're done talking now.
[152:55.42]Nothing else I can do over here.
[152:56.58]What about this crack?
[153:02.30]It's been months and they still haven't sealed up this crack.
[153:05.15]Somebody should do something about it.
[153:07.21]I say we all wear gray ribbons to raise crack awareness.
[153:11.13]Uh, mods, give me a two-minute warning.
[153:15.15]I'll be looking for it.
[153:27.24]Okay, just let me know.
[153:30.64]What the fuck do I do here?
[153:33.35]Examine this.
[153:36.11]Nutrient-rich demon broth.
[153:38.63]Will he eat it?
[153:39.31]Does somebody want to eat this?
[153:47.75]Maybe I could give this to somebody here.
[153:51.50]What about the hard hat?
[153:52.92]Nutrient-rich.
[153:53.36]The brain?
[154:06.12]I wonder if I just pour it on the brain and bring it back to life it's gonna take some real detective work to track down that missing power core I'm gonna try doing it to the brain eight minutes
[154:34.93]Alright, let's see what happens.
[154:35.91]Nutrient-rich broth on the brain.
[154:41.37]Right?
[154:42.29]Alright.
[154:43.01]Alright.
[154:43.71]Didn't even need you.

[157:24.58]Cheer up, pal.
[157:25.48]Just think of all the destruction you can cause.
[157:28.08]Go back in the diner.
[157:31.32]Keep watching the skies, Max.
[157:33.00]I'll shoot if they try anything funny.
[157:34.84]Give him more different food.
[157:37.42]I'm going to talk to Stinky now.
[157:45.56]Because seriously, there's got to be something in here I can do.
[157:49.24]Stinky's award-winning spaghetti.
[157:51.14]Mentioned in the past five issues of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
[157:55.08]Okay, yeah.
[157:56.39]Is there anything else?
[157:57.21]Like the pie?
[157:57.95]Ever since Girl Stinky took over the kitchen, Stinky's signature pies have gotten marginally more edible.
[158:03.13]The insect bits give the dough that extra... Yeah, we already saw that.
[158:05.99]Do you guys mind?
[158:07.40]I'm waiting for an important phone call.
[158:09.12]How do we get you to get called?
[158:13.60]How do we call you?
[158:15.82]I need your phone number.
[158:18.22]How do I get this phone number?
[158:23.44]Shit.
[158:30.87]The payphone.
[158:31.35]What about the payphone?
[158:32.45]The payphone, probably.
[158:33.25]Let me go to the payphone.
[158:47.79]No, it's the coins one.
[158:56.93]How do I get that fucking phone?
[158:59.23]I can't go in the kitchen, right?
[159:02.63]Wait, I can just go in the kitchen?
[159:03.81]Oh.

[159:17.92]I'm stuck I really don't know what to do I don't know what to do
[159:41.68]I would have thought it was the phone.
[159:43.12]Call her phone.
[159:44.04]But I need to maybe go back to Mama Bosco's?
[159:46.20]Maybe Bosco's mom calls?
[160:00.41]Two minute warning?
[160:01.11]There's a two minute warning.
[160:02.13]I'm sorry.
[160:08.37]I can't stream with this.

[161:09.89]I just like boogered out of my nose and it thought it was on camera.
[161:13.39]But whatever.
[161:14.02]I just typed in volcano erupt.
[161:16.76]And it was like, what if Yellowstone erupts?
[161:22.21]Is it happening?
[161:22.77]No, it's not.
[161:24.11]You guys are freaking me out right now.
[161:25.60]Alright.
[161:57.90]Bust in a minute.
[162:01.62]Oh, fuck.
[162:37.34]Is it time?
[162:37.90]Here they come!
[162:58.12]Here they come!
[163:11.05]Oh boy.
[163:40.58]Alright, that was fun.
[164:08.06]I turned off the eruption before the eruption.
[164:10.42]Alright, turn it off.
[164:13.52]Turn it off.
[164:14.00]Turn it off.
[164:14.90]Turn it off.
[164:15.92]Turn off slow mode.
[164:17.26]Well, no, turn it off.
[164:17.88]Put it on like fucking something normal.
[164:19.30]Alright.
[164:24.23]Are you guys relaxed now?
[164:30.79]Can we stop this nonsense now?
[164:35.81]Good.
[164:36.41]I'm glad.
[164:36.97]I'm glad that we all agree.
[164:45.51]Let's go back to Sam and Max.
[164:47.15]Like we should have done.
[164:49.89]And I hear some noise over here, but it's alright.
[164:54.89]Everything is fine.
[164:56.03]We're back to normal.
[165:00.92]I'm going to play the game.
[165:04.61]Worst joke of 2019.
[165:05.29]Well, that was not a joke.
[165:07.86]That was keeping chat inside of a glass jar for half an hour so they calm down.
[165:15.02]Okay.
[165:18.46]What happened?
[165:22.01]What happened?
[165:22.41]Why am I out?
[165:23.33]What happened?
[165:33.29]When did I exit the game?
[165:38.62]No, alright.
[165:39.18]Alright, let's go.
[165:39.82]Alright, fellas.
[165:40.32]I've just been thinking of myself all this time.
[165:48.93]Hand it over.
[166:15.79]I looked over and... What do you mean it's loud?
[166:18.41]That's not loud.
[166:39.48]Alright, where's the power core?
[166:40.48]Welcome back everybody.
[166:41.30]We were just testing you.
[166:42.54]Ooh, big case.
[167:03.38]Get ready to have your furry minds blown, pals, because this one goes way back.
[167:08.50]Think about it.
[167:09.60]What do we really know about this Stinky doll?
[167:12.68]Well, the story is that Grandpa Stinky actually created her using some kind of demonic spell, and she's been running the diner ever since.
[167:19.77]Right.
[167:20.17]Some crazy story it'd have to be an idiot to believe.
[167:23.57]Right.
[167:25.01]Idiot.
[167:26.11]So I started digging around, and I found this out back.
[167:30.28]What is it?
[167:31.18]Stinky my queen, I cannot wait any longer.
[167:33.78]I will be making my grand appearance this afternoon.
[167:37.17]You say they won't trust me because I'm not human, but damn the consequences.
[167:41.99]We must start phase two of the operation now.
[167:44.89]I will call your private number with the details.
[167:47.35]Love, S.
[167:48.75]an inhuman monster in bed with stinky planning something big this afternoon name starts with s you know what that means skunk ape oh well yeah I was thinking it was you sam you think you know a guy I'm not angry sam just very disappointed come on max if stinky's in cahoots with general skunk ape it may have something to do with that missing power core
[168:14.40]Good luck, fellas.
[168:15.34]I'll let you know if I find anything else.
[168:17.16]Stinky.
[168:17.64]Sam, I may be psychic now, but I've got no idea how we're going to find out Stinky's private phone number.
[168:24.84]P.S.
[168:25.58]Just to make sure, your private number is still 212-555-8942, isn't it?
[168:29.38]We got it.
[168:36.77]What do you know about this creep, General Skunk Ape?
[168:39.42]Just that he tried to hire me to find some missing toys for him.
[168:42.52]I'm too busy with my other case, so I said, nothing doing.
[168:45.96]You wouldn't know anything about these toys, would you?
[168:48.58]I can't lie to Flint Paper, Sam.
[168:50.82]I can, little buddy.
[168:52.08]Nope, not a thing.
[168:52.88]Alright, we got the number.
[168:54.99]Don't be too hard on Stinky for almost poisoning him.
[168:57.05]I'm going to call it.
[168:57.71]I'm sure it was an honest mistake.
[168:58.97]I just want to see the dialog.
[168:59.75]There's so many different kinds of toxins here.
[169:01.41]They've got their own menu.
[169:02.85]Nice try, fellas, but she's on to me.
[169:04.73]I know it.
[169:05.63]I'm getting too close on this big case of mine, and she's trying to rub me out.
[169:10.72]I'm not going to call that.
[169:11.46]That's a fake number.
[169:12.50]Here we go.
[169:13.14]Alright.
[169:13.48]Let's go call the number.
[169:16.20]I'm so glad to have you guys back.
[169:18.24]Do I play any instruments?
[169:19.56]I can play the drums.
[169:44.61]I actually can.
[169:49.99]I actually can.
[169:50.67]I know I can.
[169:51.43]I can.
[169:51.63]If you gave me a drum set, I'd be able to do it.
[169:54.07]Alright, let's call the number.
[169:59.17]You look like a drummer.
[170:04.08]What?
[170:06.90]Can I still lift 35 pounds?
[170:07.76]No, I can't.
[170:12.96]I was hoping you'd call.
[170:14.22]No, no, no, don't speak.
[170:15.62]Those detectives are finally gone, but someone might be listening in.
[170:19.90]We should meet in person.
[170:24.76]Alright, that's a food order.
[170:26.84]Check the baby.
[170:27.62]Have you checked the baby?
[170:29.74]See, Max, he's fine.
[170:31.04]I told you to stop worrying.
[170:32.70]What kind of pretend mother would I be if I didn't worry about our imaginary baby?
[170:36.26]Please say the name of the...
[170:40.59]I was hoping you'd come.
[170:41.63]Okay, uh, food order.
[170:43.53]You must have me confused with someone else.
[170:45.27]Oh, fuck.
[170:45.67]I wanted one of your lobster-fed piglet buffet platters to go, please.
[170:49.69]She hung up on me.
[170:50.63]How rude.
[170:53.32]Please say the name.
[170:55.56]I was hoping... Alright, let's meet.
[170:57.70]Yes.
[170:59.68]We should go to that place with the things that you like.
[171:04.15]perfect I'll leave right away that is the exact voice that I know oh my love when I'm doing anything one more thing are you a corn dog yeah let me just tell you about this that's perfect what of course not and sam and max don't suspect a thing well that's a relief ever since the dairy freeze shut down stinky's corn dogs have been my only source of nutritious pig sphincters
[171:35.22]So now we can go press the button.
[171:39.30]Hurry up, quickly.
[171:53.53]Let's take the DeSoto for a spin, Sam.
[171:55.63]I want to see what evil the cops have wrought.
[171:59.86]We can in a minute.
[172:01.18]I need to press the button.
[172:03.79]Take the money out of the register.
[172:06.07]Oh, alright.
[172:06.41]Alright.
[172:06.69]Okay.
[172:06.91]Secret.
[172:07.79]Anything else back here?
[172:09.41]No.
[172:33.15]Go down the secret passage.
[172:36.01]Get the power core, hook it up, attach it to the brain.
[172:38.97]Episode over.
[172:49.47]There it is.
[172:49.71]There's a big pile of low-tech audio-video equipment tossed out like pianos from a falling zeppelin.
[172:55.26]And it's still warm.
[172:56.94]Documentary filmmakers must be lurking nearby.
[172:59.99]Some secret passage.
[173:01.55]It's just a bunch of junk, like this old scanner.
[173:04.17]That's it.
[173:04.49]Attach that to the battery.
[173:05.57]Alright, I got the power core, I've got the jumper cables, let's go back to the ship.
[173:50.38]And fill it in!
[173:51.14]Move that.
[173:57.98]Don't hurt the seagulls, what are you talking about?
[174:00.80]No, no, no, no!
[174:02.18]What?
[174:02.40]Just go in the ship and go up the stairs!
[174:20.85]Alright, connect this to that.
[174:25.07]Is this thing evil?
[174:26.15]This is probably the evil thing, right?
[174:27.63]This should give that brain the jolt he needs to face the morning.
[174:30.83]Now we just need some way to hook it up.
[174:32.96]Jumping cables.
[174:40.40]Turn it on.
[174:43.26]You did it, Sam and Max.
[174:45.08]You awakened me from the sleep of 100 deaths.
[174:49.23]How did you do it?
[174:50.49]Easy peasy.
[174:51.65]All it took was Stinky's demon broth and Mama Bosco's futuristic power core.
[174:56.35]Don't forget the jumper cables, Sam.
[174:58.03]They were very important.
[174:59.81]Whatever the case, listen carefully.
[175:02.32]Do not trust General Scuncafe.
[175:05.30]He is... He is... Something's happening.
[175:09.32]Toys detected.
[175:09.66]Toys detected.
[175:11.22]Toys detected.
[175:12.34]What are you doing, brain?
[175:14.07]Cut it out.
[175:15.17]I can't help it.
[175:16.29]I'm...
[175:18.82]I mean, what a pleasant surprise.
[175:20.70]Tell me, friend brain, where is the toy?
[175:22.83]Two toys.
[175:23.13]Why is it alive?
[175:23.95]The weak can't trace.
[175:25.63]Brian, what's it?
[175:27.97]Curses.
[175:28.23]Very well.
[175:49.12]I'll find them myself.
[175:54.96]Is he gone?
[175:56.44]Yeah, the coast is clear.
[175:58.34]What just happened?
[175:59.10]I don't know.
[176:00.40]I've never felt anything like that.
[176:02.50]The toys of this planet must have astonishing power.
[176:07.53]Where is Skunk Ape's collection of magic toys?
[176:10.25]He keeps them on display as a show of power.
[176:13.10]I'm regaining control over the ship's functions so I can reveal them to you.
[176:17.38]Behold!
[176:19.08]That's it?
[176:20.70]That's it.
[176:21.76]It's a toy that lets you teleport across vast distances in the blink of an eye using only the power of your mind.
[176:28.91]That's not cool enough for you?
[176:31.21]It's just, we saw more toys in Max's vision.
[176:34.91]Alright, I need the other toys.
[176:37.10]I got this, the rocket launcher.
[176:39.18]I need the... I gotta get the telephone.
[176:40.86]Give me the phone.
[176:41.44]Wait, is that it?
[176:41.96]Can I talk to you anymore?
[177:02.82]You have any more dialog?
[177:03.60]Sam and Max, do not trust Scuncape.
[177:07.31]His benevolent facade belies a heart of pure evil.
[177:11.85]Uh, yeah, we kind of already figured that out.
[177:14.27]The giant fanged spaceship with disintegrator eyes was our first clue.
[177:20.10]Are you calling me gullible?
[177:22.04]What?
[177:22.81]Look, I don't know what planet you're from.
[177:25.29]This one, actually.
[177:26.39]But on my world, if an alien invites you onto his spaceship, you don't just assume that he's going to cut out your brain and keep it in a jar.
[177:34.61]I guess we're just not that cynical.
[177:37.03]To be fair, Max, your future vision goggles did tip us off.
[177:40.44]You mean you wield the eyes of Yogg-Sagoth?
[177:44.92]But that must mean you also have the gift.
[177:49.62]Is Max is going to end up being Yogg-Sagoth, right?
[177:56.57]Something like that.
[177:57.59]I could see that happening.
[178:00.11]In the future, you seem to know all about Max's psychic powers.
[178:03.65]Yes, Max is one with the gift.
[178:06.07]The toys have great power, but only to those of us with a special brain.
[178:10.83]Well, Max does have a special brain.
[178:13.31]That's what all the teachers said.
[178:14.87]Well, that and... Back!
[178:16.08]Back!
[178:16.58]I cast thee out, demon!
[178:18.36]You must use the gift wisely, Max, and keep it secret from General Skunkappe.
[178:23.69]The power is every bit as dangerous as it is wicked awesome.
[178:29.70]Okay.
[178:30.82]So where are the mole men going?
[178:31.86]What's that mole processing going all about?
[178:33.96]Isn't it obvious?
[178:35.14]General Skunkape is illegally harvesting mole juice.
[178:39.50]Mole juice?
[178:40.62]It's blood.
[178:43.32]They're mammals.
[178:44.16]There's blood.
[178:44.80]This is just... That's okay.
[178:48.82]What is Skunk Ape's evil scheme, anyhow?
[178:51.26]No less than domination of the entire universe.
[178:57.27]Did he ever mention anything more specific?
[178:59.57]He's traveling from planet to planet, searching for all the toys of power.
[179:04.21]If he ever manages to collect all of them, he'll be completely unstoppable!
[179:09.08]Mammals aren't the only thing with blood.
[179:13.68]Yeah, but I mean, like, a mole is a mammal and they just have red blood.
[179:17.34]They have, like, human blood.
[179:20.39]Moles, cows, dogs, humans, they all have human blood.
[179:27.23]We all have the same blood.
[179:29.69]Why did Skunk Ape come here, to our street?
[179:32.37]He's been using my strange psychic connection to the Toys of Power to track them throughout the galaxy.
[179:39.20]Something very powerful pulled me to this spot.
[179:43.02]I can only guess it was Max's discovery of the eyes of Yogg-Sagoth and the future vision.
[179:51.98]What's your story, Brain?
[179:53.16]Can we get you anything?
[179:54.61]Like a spine?
[179:56.43]No, it's too late for me, I'm afraid.
[179:58.95]I can only help you put a stop to General Scuncape's evil schemes by controlling the doors and the higher functions of this spaceship.
[180:07.04]We must work quickly before... What is in this broth?
[180:11.22]Is that oregano?
[180:12.24]It's delightful.
[180:13.74]Stay focused, pal.
[180:15.28]It's demon broth.
[180:16.44]Okay.
[180:17.18]I think I got it.
[180:18.04]How did you get here?
[180:19.37]I have found a mysterious toy and was using my strange power over it to amaze and delight the ladies of my village.
[180:27.77]It was then that Skunkape's ship landed.
[180:30.78]He was intrigued with my power and invited me on board his spaceship.
[180:35.20]So you just went with him?
[180:36.74]He said he had candy.
[180:38.58]How was I supposed to know he'd imprison me here, forcing me to use my psychic powers against my will?
[180:44.58]Okay.
[180:47.42]Where's your body?
[180:48.72]What did you look like back when you had a body?
[180:51.18]Oh, nothing exceptional.
[180:52.69]About 6'3", raven hair.
[180:54.75]I had what you earthlings call a runner's build.
[180:57.71]I can read minds in the future, you know.
[181:00.67]Alright, fine.
[181:01.85]I believe the closest creature you have on your planet is called a platypus.
[181:07.58]okay why are we supposed to stop skunk ape any weaknesses like he's powerless against the color yellow or he can't cross running water or he's powerless against yellow water I know what you're thinking max and stop it well of course the toys of power are useless to him without a gifted brain to control them so he doesn't have a different graph he always says he has a weakness for potato chips and he has to eat the whole bag yeah that doesn't really help us much
[181:34.63]Sometimes when he's in the shower, I could swear I hear him crying.
[181:38.41]Okay.
[181:41.57]Why do you think Max's powers are dangerous?
[181:43.89]Apart from the obvious, of course.
[181:45.80]General Scuncape can't use the toys of power himself, so he needs the brain of someone who has the gift.
[181:53.30]He forced me to use my power so much that I would have died had you not rescued me.
[181:58.82]If he ever found out you have the gift, Max, he wouldn't hesitate to do the same to you.
[182:07.94]Okay, that's all the evidence we need.
[182:10.16]Let's go out and deliver some interplanetary justice, Max.
[182:13.86]If you end up cutting out his brain, I call dibs on Skunkape's body.
[182:20.11]Yeah, this is the bad guy, probably.
[182:21.81]Okay, so now we gotta go.
[182:23.25]Oh, we have a scanner.
[182:26.51]And I somehow just clicked out of the window.
[182:29.17]I don't know how that happened.
[182:33.92]Play Just Dance.
[182:43.80]Spaceship is secure.
[182:45.40]If I could have a moment, sirs.
[182:47.08]Hello, Sam, Mr. President.
[182:48.84]If you have a moment, you need to be debriefed.
[182:51.17]Too late!
[182:52.31]This may come as a shock, but our intel indicates that General Skunk Cop A is actually quite evil.
[182:57.41]No!
[183:02.87]I'm pretty sure I never heard of a Department of Homeworld Security, Agent Superball.
[183:07.48]Established in 1901 by Theodore Roosevelt after President McKinley's assassination by one of the insect doors of the Nebulon Empire.
[183:14.00]I'm president of the United States!
[183:16.24]Why didn't I hear anything about it?
[183:18.08]It's explained in books, sir.
[183:20.06]It can fight the other fucking 30 viruses I have.
[183:25.31]They'll all eat each other until there's one that remains, and then I'll just remove that with a fucking sea cleaner.
[183:31.01]Is that why you were hanging out in our office so much last season?
[183:33.94]I mean, a few months ago?
[183:35.14]To protect Max?
[183:36.84]Uh, sure.
[183:38.26]Wow.
[183:38.94]I feel really close to you right now, Agent Superball.
[183:43.91]Likewise, sir.
[183:44.85]A bit too close.
[183:54.11]Okay, what's the real story behind Skunk Ape?
[183:57.55]General Skunk Hop A is an intergalactic criminal warlord.
[184:00.37]There's been a galaxy-wide gorilla-hunted effect ever since he escaped from the Penal Zone.
[184:04.93]Oh, I didn't even talk about the thing that I want to do.
[184:06.79]It's an interdimensional prison for the most dangerous villains in the universe.
[184:09.70]How are we supposed to get Skunk Ape back into the Penal Zone?
[184:13.10]The United Planets have simple and easily reproducible fail-safe measures in place to handle escaped convicts.
[184:18.54]Well, that's a relief.
[184:20.10]All we need to do is open an unstable trans-dimensional gateway to the penal zone, and his prisoner's badge will take care of the rest.
[184:26.21]Didn't they do this schtick before?
[184:27.85]A couple times where you... You do the end of the game, and then they go back and do everything before the end of the game?
[184:36.19]Like they, hey, this is the very end!
[184:38.54]But now do the whole thing.
[184:39.96]They've done it like two or three times.
[184:42.24]But anyways, I was in the Recommended channel a few days ago.
[184:46.58]And I saw an idea that looked really, really funny.
[184:50.76]I believe it was VRJosh that had this idea, so, you know, whoever else contributed to it, like, props to you.
[184:58.92]Do you remember when last week I showed that video?
[185:03.74]And in the video, the person, it was somebody's music video, and they had hidden me in, like, a part of the tree.
[185:12.59]you weren't there but if you were there you'll know so they hid me in a part like in one frame of a video and they were saying oh look you're in this video and I couldn't find it so what the recommendation said wouldn't it be fun potentially if I did a whole stream where it was just where's waldo people would submit images that I would get to have a magnifying glass and try to find where they've put me in the image
[185:44.75]I feel like it would be pretty fun.
[185:48.34]I get to have... The only criteria is obviously it has to be... It's going to be completely vetted.
[185:54.29]Um...
[185:57.38]So I get to have that little Microsoft magnifying glass.
[186:00.94]That's the only thing I get.
[186:02.18]And I have to stay a certain amount of feet from the screen.
[186:05.08]So I can't, like, lean the fuck in like this.
[186:07.02]No.
[186:07.60]I have to be sitting back here.
[186:09.52]We'll have something to make it so, like, I'll bump into it if I lean forward.
[186:12.48]And I just get the Microsoft magnifying glass.
[186:17.76]And people can submit it and put me, obviously, in places wherever they want.
[186:27.50]There'll be a lot of hidden memes.
[186:29.10]That's where I have to be careful, though, because they gotta be really, like, cleanly vetted.
[186:39.55]And if you put something fucked up in there, you're out.
[186:46.61]Like a, yeah, like a hidden object game.
[186:59.18]When am I gonna do it?
[187:00.00]I mean, this was just a random idea, and I thought it was interesting, so... I would assume if it's something that I'll talk to the mods about it, and maybe we'll get a plan.
[187:10.45]And then we'll open up, obviously, potential, like, submissions for it.
[187:13.17]I didn't notice Skunk Ape wearing any kind of badge or homing beacon.
[187:16.53]That's because he wasn't wearing one, sir.
[187:18.61]I find it extraordinarily alarming.
[187:20.79]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down.
[187:22.21]We can't think with all your hysterics.
[187:24.38]Forgive me, Mr. President, but unless you can find General Skunkape's homing beacon and place it on him, we're powerless to stop him.
[187:32.07]There'd have to be rules where I would have to be a certain amount of pixels.
[187:36.39]You can't just make me one pixel and put me there.
[187:39.28]No, no, no.
[187:40.50]It has to be solvable.
[187:41.60]It can't be impossible.
[187:46.62]What did this homing beacon look like?
[187:48.75]It's a standard-issue intergalactic correctional facility inmate's badge.
[187:52.56]It can't be destroyed, so the only way he could have gotten rid of it is by giving it to someone else.
[187:58.22]Oh, what would be a decent idea is to have a channel for this, right?
[188:02.69]Alright, I just figured it out.
[188:05.31]So to avoid, like, hey, look, I put a, like...
[188:10.00]little dick on the screen that you're going to scroll over with the magnifying glass and it's going to be hard to, like, you know, go through it and screen it all.
[188:17.03]And, oh, look, you've scrolled over the dick on screen.
[188:19.53]Oh, that's funny.
[188:21.27]To make sure that doesn't happen, maybe have a chat in the Discord open to have, like, ideas and, like, designated people actually put it in the image.
[188:30.45]You know what I'm saying?
[188:33.99]That's probably better.
[188:38.02]A group effort where, like, only a dozen people have the key.
[188:41.86]I think that's pretty good.
[188:45.86]Yeah.
[188:46.04]We have to open an unstable trans-dimensional gateway?
[188:50.35]You must have lost your senses, man!
[188:52.11]The odds against that are astronomical!
[188:54.33]Even if we did know what that was.
[188:56.33]The gateway is the easy part, sirs.
[188:58.35]Dr. Mamabosco's reckless and blasphemous work tearing down the fabric of reality could be useful.
[189:03.26]That'd be fun.
[189:06.58]Give me the key, give me the key.
[189:12.55]A school group project where one guy does all the work.
[189:15.49]That's the idea.
[189:16.29]Okay, so we need the homing beacon.
[189:29.35]We gotta throw it on a skunk ape's back.
[189:31.35]We can't track him without his homing beacon, sir.
[189:33.83]This will require some traditional detective work.
[189:36.03]Alright, let's go.
[189:36.69]Will reckless and irrational detective work do?
[189:39.09]Cause that's all we know.
[189:40.50]I'd recommend starting with some of his known contacts.
[189:44.80]Mama Bosco.
[189:46.68]What do we need from Mama Bosco?
[189:48.64]Her dimensional destabilizer can open a gateway to the penal zone.
[189:52.41]Anyone wearing a prisoner's homing beacon will be returned to justice automatically and scientifically.
[189:57.11]Alright, let's go.
[190:01.59]Yes, I get it, sir.
[190:02.37]Okay, wait.
[190:03.17]Nothing else with you?
[190:04.13]Okay.
[190:04.43]Well, give me the other item.
[190:06.27]Can I get this, or do I have to open it or something later?
[190:27.10]Max, this unassuming telephone unlocks the gift of teleportation.
[190:36.56]Using the power of your mind, you can teleport yourself to any phone number you have memorized.
[190:43.44]Oh boy, I want to try it right now!
[190:46.02]Alright, let's teleport.
[190:46.78]I don't like the thought of you teleporting off without me, Max.
[190:49.72]You can go too, Sam.
[190:51.18]Max will teleport anyone he's touching.
[190:53.93]Watch the hands!
[190:58.94]okay teleportation where do I want to go stinky's cell bosco tech sybil's let's go let's go into stinky's cell
[191:25.49]Enjoying the ride, son?
[191:28.17]I don't know what's so scary.
[191:31.11]He's made her a bread.
[191:35.29]Note to self, when traveling through Max's brain, keep your eyes shut.
[191:40.81]Uh-oh.
[191:49.11]My phone just started.
[191:50.07]Somebody actually just texted me right now.
[191:52.82]What happened?
[191:53.40]That was weird.
[191:57.44]It's Stinky's cell phone, but why would she have left it behind?
[192:00.90]Especially since she's got 18 months left on her contract.
[192:04.28]Either there was some kind of struggle, or it was left here for us to find and we're walking right into a trap.
[192:09.74]I got it!
[192:10.84]She waived her early cancellation fees with a recommended device upgrade!
[192:14.16]That just happened!
[192:15.00]So now we know two things.
[192:16.76]You're an idiot, and this phone is going to lead us directly to General Skunking, somehow.
[192:23.35]What the fuck?
[192:25.17]I can't win!
[192:31.82]Well, now I have the phone.
[192:34.00]I've got the phone, the scanner, the warrant.
[192:37.97]What else do I need to find Carmen Sandiego?
[192:46.95]Let's teleport somewhere else.
[192:52.07]Is that a cow?
[192:57.03]Sibyl.
[193:05.90]Where's her phone?
[193:13.18]Shouldn't I have appeared in the box?
[193:14.80]Alright, we got to go.
[193:19.33]I got a scanner.
[193:20.53]What's this?
[193:21.15]It's one of those obsolete all-in-one scanner fax copier juice maker machines.
[193:24.99]OK.
[193:28.47]Can't interact with the rats.
[193:29.41]I've already tried.
[193:32.32]Nothing in the boxes?
[193:33.13]I can't believe it says boxes.
[193:34.01]Nothing back there.
[193:34.51]Phone's lighting up again.
[193:35.07]Uh, hold on.
[193:35.59]What about the phone in here?
[194:05.33]Are you guys still looking for a fourth member?
[194:07.61]Well, hello there, beautiful.
[194:09.64]Were your moving parts properly secured when you fell from heaven?
[194:15.33]Do not forget our seminar on workplace harassment.
[194:19.55]Plus, I call dibs.
[194:21.47]When, exactly, did this get really creepy?
[194:24.05]Thank you for joining us in a brand new style of 20th century crime fighting.
[194:28.31]You can begin submitting clues to the Crime Tron whenever you find them.
[194:31.96]I do have clues.
[194:32.54]Any ideas on the case, cops?
[194:34.16]We're sorry, we haven't been paying attention.
[194:37.12]I got a phone.
[194:37.84]Man evidence with the crime hype in Tron, and we will track down the villains without mercy.
[194:44.22]Am I angry?
[194:47.42]what angry what no it's because I'm in like a blue room and it I probably look menacing I don't want to toss this thing around I might break it I'm inside of like the hold on I better keep this note there could be valuable information on it that's not evidence wait the phone and this this is not evidence I better keep this note there could be valuable information on it
[195:15.71]It looks like you're using the Crimetron.
[195:18.35]Would you like help?
[195:20.89]Uh, sure.
[195:21.83]I'd keep it short.
[195:22.77]Place any two pieces of evidence into the Crimetron XL Multiscanner.
[195:27.84]If a piece of evidence is found on our database, you'll hear this noise.
[195:33.34]If we cannot recognize a piece, you'll hear this.
[195:37.11]After two items are inserted, our exclusive ClueMatch technology will scan for possible connections.
[195:43.44]Advanced data analysis algorithms will compare the evidence against our 64KB database at up to 1-2 calculations per second.
[195:53.70]You're not helping.
[195:55.04]It's really not all that complicated.
[195:57.64]I can also help organize your compact disk collection.
[196:01.64]If the CrimeTron can find a connection between the two pieces of evidence...
[196:07.78]then you get yourself a warrant.
[196:08.84]Yeah, well let's go.
[196:09.34]Really?
[196:09.54]That don't work?
[196:35.44]If Stinky went somewhere to meet Skunky, she's probably got the number of a place on speed dial.
[196:42.25]So this is not it.
[196:43.25]Item not recognized.
[196:44.99]Come on.
[196:52.25]No.
[196:52.93]I need another piece of evidence.
[196:53.74]I need the phone.
[196:54.24]But the phone number's on there.
[196:55.74]Do we need two phones?
[197:00.70]Alright, those don't work.
[197:02.56]So I need something else.
[197:05.79]What do you mean?
[197:06.13]Wait, wait, what are you talking about?
[197:07.32]This is my gun.
[197:09.34]If Stinky went somewhere to meet Skunk Ape, she's probably got the number of the place on screen.
[197:13.68]No, this is my gun.
[197:20.06]So that's not it.
[197:20.50]I need something else.
[197:21.96]General, Skunk Ape could be anywhere in the city.
[197:23.90]He could have at least left a forwarding address or a phone number.
[197:29.27]I don't, I, really?
[197:31.81]It's the note Flint Paper found from the mysterious Mr. S to Stinky.
[197:35.55]Number and then the phone.
[197:37.99]I don't want to use up Stinky's minutes.
[197:43.10]Admit it, Sam.
[197:44.14]You don't know how to turn it on.
[197:45.60]If God wanted us to use cell phones, he wouldn't have invented the torch.
[197:48.84]There's another piece of evidence that I need to find.
[197:52.89]I can't reuse it.
[197:55.23]It's Stinky's newfangled cellular telephone.
[197:57.33]Yeah, that's it.
[198:02.29]Alright.
[198:04.75]Shoot the phone.
[198:05.55]Put the stream on my other monitor.
[198:07.81]No, I don't need to do that.
[198:09.09]Let me go back up here.
[198:09.91]Because I just ran the hell out of here right after I, um...
[198:32.35]Right after I got done with you talking to you.
[198:34.62]Alright, what's this?
[198:36.80]Water?
[198:39.09]I didn't look at anything down here.
[198:40.25]Not even water, okay.
[198:57.57]I need something to connect the cell phone to something else.
[199:01.68]But I don't have that something else.
[199:02.88]General Skunk Ape could be anywhere in the city.
[199:05.16]He could have at least left a forwarding address or a phone number.
[199:13.40]Can I go in the mole processing center?
[199:15.10]No, open it.
[199:15.48]There we go.
[199:42.52]Reflection of screen in my eyes.
[199:45.54]Really?
[199:46.46]You can see that?
[199:47.52]Congratulations.
[199:48.80]Prepare yourself for a fabulous off-world vacation courtesy of General Skunkope.
[199:54.26]Very exciting.
[199:56.02]Why aren't there any doors?
[199:57.51]We'll feel a slight tingle as we take your personal items for safekeeping.
[200:02.57]Slight tingle?
[200:04.13]Whoa, hey now.
[200:07.74]That means I got a pretty good HD screen base.
[200:09.20]Sam, why is the floor so slippery?
[200:27.20]For the comfort of guests waiting outside, please refrain from screaming or crying out.
[200:32.88]Please don't scream.
[200:33.68]Do you smell something burning?
[200:35.93]Sam, why haven't we ever seen any mole people come out of here?
[200:40.35]Enjoy the rest of your experience, and remember that your sacrifice is for the glory of General Skunkabe.
[200:47.38]Sacrifice?
[200:48.40]Are we going to die, Sam?
[200:50.18]Depends on whether we can think of a way out of this death trap, little buddy.
[200:53.32]Alright, think of a way out of the incinerator.
[200:58.02]Through the drain.
[201:03.86]Get my items.
[201:04.90]Max, pull the whatever you have stuffed wherever it is now.
[201:11.05]I don't know where to get it.
[201:12.71]Wait.
[201:13.45]Teleport out with the teleportation goggles.
[201:16.27]Wait, I want to see the future.
[201:30.78]Where do I want to go?
[201:33.99]Cops.
[201:34.95]Bosco Tech.
[201:38.39]I think I'm just going to... I'm going to be a banana.
[201:42.61]I don't think I can do anything with a banana.
[201:50.00]Can I turn and walk the other way?
[201:53.68]No.
[201:53.86]I'm just going to teleport out.
[201:58.07]Let's go to... You're just saying banana, okay.
[202:02.31]Let's go to Boskotech.
[202:09.55]I need evidence.
[202:14.18]Oh, that part.
[202:17.68]I remember that part.
[202:18.54]The strangle part.
[202:23.07]Hey, you guys can't do that to me.
[202:24.99]Looks to me like we just did.
[202:27.67]At least give me back my sidekick.
[202:29.69]You'll get the rabbit once Jerome's done working him over.
[202:34.88]Max's teleportation power is pretty cool.
[202:37.34]I just wish there weren't so much inappropriate touching involved.
[202:39.92]I don't have any stuff.
[202:50.30]Put on the goggles.
[202:55.95]So he's knocked out.
[202:58.46]Up the fire escape.
[203:00.68]Ugh, I just wanted to see how I died.
[203:02.10]Alright, bye.
[203:07.04]I'm gonna drop the AC on his head.
[203:13.43]Just wait.
[203:27.84]Pretty cool.
[203:28.82]Not useful, though.
[203:30.56]Can't do anything with this?
[203:31.30]What about the banner?
[203:33.20]It's kind of tacky, the way Mama Bosco hung that banner right over the sidewalk.
[203:36.94]There's a glowing... There's a glowing bird on this.
[203:40.53]Look at... What was that?
[203:43.27]It's kind of tacky, the way Mama Bosco hung that banner right over the sidewalk.
[203:51.95]Alright, pigeon.
[203:53.01]Hand over the shiny thing and nobody has to get hurt.
[203:55.23]That's not the sun.
[203:59.71]Hey, careful where you drop that thing.
[204:05.03]Can I jump down?
[204:09.51]It's just a ring, okay.
[204:20.22]Do a plunging kill.
[204:21.34]A falling R1.
[204:30.59]Alright, shiny thing.
[204:32.13]It's an engagement ring.
[204:34.17]Engagement ring?
[204:35.23]I've got a feeling Skunk Ape picked it up while he was out looking for toys.
[204:39.02]Oh, there's an engraving.
[204:40.50]Hard luck.
[204:42.06]Classy.
[204:43.74]Evidence?
[204:44.12]Is that evidence?
[204:47.80]Hey, Space Gorilla, you're kind of blocking the door there.
[204:50.72]Mind if we scooch on by?
[204:52.24]We're closed.
[204:55.84]Top rope kill.
[204:58.38]Here, what about this?
[205:03.98]Well, let's teleport out of here.
[205:11.02]Oh, my.
[205:14.44]That was fucking terrible.
[205:15.60]Alright.
[205:18.76]Where do I go?
[205:20.92]Bosco Tech.
[205:22.46]Stinky's Cell.
[205:25.55]Stinky's Cell.
[205:27.53]Wait, no.
[205:28.37]It's inside the...
[205:30.89]Where is it right now?
[205:35.21]Oh, no, no, no.
[205:35.69]Back up.
[205:37.75]Oh, he's in here.
[205:38.75]He's inside.
[205:39.53]I just did it.
[205:41.78]No, no, no.
[205:42.14]Close the door.
[205:42.64]Alright, we did it.
[205:59.84]Alright, so I have the engagement ring.
[206:03.65]Now, should I just go see if I can put that into evidence?
[206:12.77]Give the ring to Max.
[206:19.44]Okay.
[206:25.18]I'm not ready to commit.
[206:29.22]It doesn't do anything.
[206:49.82]I can't look like I'm having too much fun.
[206:51.97]Alright?
[206:52.21]Don't look like you're having too much fun, Jeremy.
[206:58.46]Uh, so.
[206:59.94]Let's go to the, uh, scanner.
[207:10.07]Oh, fuck, I need a cell phone.
[207:14.07]No, no, no.
[207:15.53]I need my, my stuff.
[207:16.73]How do I get my stuff back?
[207:22.13]I have to, like, bring... Okay.
[207:23.31]Okay.
[207:26.01]Wait, just go in and collect the units.
[207:28.39]Just go collect them.
[207:30.77]Just go open up the personal item bin.
[207:36.59]I didn't use the ring on Max.
[207:38.01]What are you talking about?
[207:39.09]Yes, I did.
[207:41.14]Use ring on Max.
[207:42.56]I'm not ready to commit.
[207:43.66]What are you guys talking about?
[207:46.46]What about the agent?
[207:50.40]I'm not ready to commit.
[207:52.72]I got one guide, right.
[207:54.42]Oh, well.
[208:05.13]Now, don't make me put it on 30-minute slow-mode again.
[208:08.01]I'll do it.
[208:09.53]That was the look of... He won't do it.
[208:19.97]Hey, it's all my stuff.
[208:26.81]Okay.
[208:27.37]I got my cell phone.
[208:29.45]Alright.
[208:30.05]Hold on a minute here.
[208:31.11]That's why I don't do facecam.
[208:33.09]That... The last...
[208:35.69]four seconds is the reason why I never have it on I'm not ready to commit he's not ready to commit stop pressuring him into marrying somebody
[209:04.36]Okay.
[209:04.98]Let's try the cell phone in the ring.
[209:06.92]Or the ring in the note.
[209:09.50]Let's see if we can get one.
[209:13.16]Otherwise, I'm going to have to go back to... Let's just leave this one.
[209:18.79]We have to use it on Max outside.
[209:30.54]I'm, not ready to commit mama bosco would be really helpful right about now if we could just get into her lab I just got Luigi Now let's do note no no note is nothing about the ring and the cell phone skunk ape got this ring from somewhere, but Yeah
[210:00.98]Yeah?
[210:03.26]No?
[210:03.80]That's enough.
[210:09.42]SkullCape got this ring from somewhere.
[210:12.20]It's in it.
[210:13.02]What is it, another ring?
[210:18.04]Alright, where'd he get the ring?
[210:22.28]From Sybil's belongings.
[210:24.66]Right?
[210:24.90]Wee-hee-hee!
[210:30.58]That's what I would think.
[210:31.92]Mama Bosco would be really helpful right now.
[210:34.28]I know, I know, I know.
[210:35.76]I don't really want to get into Mama Bosco's lab.
[210:40.08]Let's get out there.
[210:53.39]Strangle again?
[210:54.93]No visitors.
[210:59.98]So let me teleport you somewhere else.
[211:01.88]I'm surprised that didn't work last time.
[211:03.90]So teleport.
[211:06.38]Where's he going to... We're going to get, like, stuck.
[211:12.79]Diner.
[211:14.49]I feel like being in a... Symbols?
[211:28.25]Let's just see what happens if we go to the diner.
[211:32.57]Either that or the... No.
[211:35.86]Hey, next time you go to Stinky's, bring me back one of those salted banana nut logs, would you?
[211:41.04]Shut up.
[211:44.58]Um, alright.
[211:45.40]Well, hold on.
[211:46.08]Let me look at this.
[211:48.64]Because they get... He gets knocked out by the... What?
[211:53.86]The pole?
[211:55.66]They both get knocked out out here.
[211:56.85]Do it again!
[211:57.13]Do it again!
[211:58.90]What knocks him out over here?
[212:01.02]Well, that knocked him out cold.
[212:02.30]Well, that knocked him out cold.
[212:03.30]Do it again!
[212:03.64]Do it again!
[212:05.96]Drop the pole?
[212:06.70]Unscrew the pole?
[212:18.09]Can we just teleport to here?
[212:23.21]I wonder what happens if... Well, I just teleport and, like, telefrag him.
[212:28.74]No, we'd be telepracking ourselves.
[212:37.72]Turn your lights on?
[212:38.54]The lights are on.
[212:43.29]Do I have to drop, like, a bowling ball off this or something?
[212:49.63]Whee!
[213:07.09]I almost feel like I need a new location.
[213:09.97]He gets grabbed.
[213:13.31]Yeah.
[213:16.65]And then I can walk around out here.
[213:23.36]Teleport him.
[213:26.84]Can I put... Alright.
[213:28.52]Can I put the phone down?
[213:33.26]Okay.
[213:34.60]I gotta...
[213:54.59]Come on, no, really?
[213:55.88]Come on.
[213:57.10]I thought this was gonna be it.
[213:59.00]Put the phone on the pole.
[214:01.80]And then teleport to the phone.
[214:07.14]Shit.
[214:11.68]That's, I have to put this somewhere.
[214:13.21]Can I put this, like, in... Where do I put the phone?
[214:19.15]Under him?
[214:19.93]Can I, like, slide it under him like a ghost trap?
[214:28.23]Stinky's phone.
[214:32.34]But if I don't put the phone down, they're gonna teleport to me and hit me.
[214:39.98]Let's try it.
[214:44.18]Are we all gonna fall down?
[215:01.94]Alright, now let's go in to the lab.
[215:04.05]That's a Jerma voice.
[215:30.19]Yeah, see, that's what I... Somebody said the same thing.
[215:32.37]I thought it was, like, prison cell.
[215:34.19]Like, go to Stinky's cell.
[215:37.24]Like, oh, she's in prison.
[215:39.72]Because she got arrested for... I don't know why.
[215:41.24]I didn't think about... I didn't think that now.
[215:42.88]Alright, we got a receipt.
[215:43.46]Receipt in the ring.
[215:44.00]Alright, let me see it.
[215:58.04]One of Skunk Ape's minions left behind this torn receipt from a... What does it say on it?
[216:03.79]Paddle... Paddle ball?
[216:08.23]What else is in here?
[216:11.16]Can I use this phone?
[216:12.88]Hello, operator?
[216:15.42]Oops, sorry.
[216:16.90]You know how those spirits are once they get talking about the good old days when they were alive.
[216:20.78]I guess we can't make outgoing calls.
[216:23.39]Let's go talk to Mama Bosco.
[216:25.17]Yeah, Mama Bosco.
[216:27.09]What's going on here?
[216:33.61]Mama Bosco, help.
[216:34.85]Thanks for getting rid of those gorillas, Sam and Max.
[216:38.91]Alright.
[216:40.03]What does that dimensional destabilizer do exactly?
[216:43.73]It opens a temporary gateway between one dimension and the next, which can pull someone from the spirit world into the real world.
[216:51.08]Or from the real world to an interdimensional prison.
[216:54.04]I suppose so.
[216:55.12]Do you think that's what Konkape was trying to keep people from finding?
[216:59.25]I don't know.
[217:00.39]My money's still in the big screen thing.
[217:02.49]That's just cool.
[217:03.93]Well, it's worth a try.
[217:05.37]I built a remote control so you can open the gateway anywhere.
[217:09.35]It'll only stay open a few minutes, so you've got to make sure you do it right.
[217:13.45]Anybody holding something tuned to the alternate dimension will get sucked right in.
[217:17.76]Okay.
[217:21.37]Max is confused about how that dimensional destabilizer works.
[217:25.01]You just have to find Skunkape and open up the gateway.
[217:28.55]If he's holding anything tuned to that dimension, he'll get sucked in.
[217:32.49]The remote control for it is right over there.
[217:34.67]Get the remote.
[217:36.59]He needs to have something that is tuned to the second dimension.
[217:40.05]They came in and took over the place right after I told him about my dimensional destabilizer.
[217:45.63]Well, that was uncalled for.
[217:47.73]Yeah, I mean, sure, she's really boring about it, but that's no excuse for violence.
[217:53.28]I'm pretty sure he was trying to keep anybody from using my inventions against him.
[218:04.22]Don't make me do it.
[218:08.66]Did Skunk Ape give you any idea what he's got planned?
[218:11.81]Nope.
[218:12.39]He just told his guards to make sure nobody found out about my inventions.
[218:19.31]Let's get the remote.
[218:19.89]I'm not gonna do it again, don't worry.
[218:31.52]I'm just kidding.
[218:32.20]Eh, that's what I want you to think.
[218:36.10]Okay, so, let me get the remote.
[218:37.94]Thank you.
[218:40.20]I have the remote.
[218:41.56]Is this the remote control for your destabilizer thing, Mama Bosco?
[218:45.17]That's the one.
[218:46.15]Make sure you don't press it before you really need to, because you only get one chance.
[218:52.36]I'll fix the light, don't worry.
[218:55.90]Too bright.
[219:04.54]Um... To Xbox.
[219:09.49]I feel like I've had an Xbox booth at fucking, like, PAX.
[219:13.23]Uh, no, that's fine.
[219:16.14]No, that's like, I look like I'm, like, I look sick.
[219:18.19]Now it's too bright.
[219:33.03]That's better.
[219:34.11]Okay, that's better.
[219:37.59]Do Twitch purple?
[219:38.67]No, I'm not going to Twitch purple.
[219:40.81]I can't even do purple.
[219:42.89]It's a color that somehow doesn't really work that well.
[219:48.12]Alright, so I got the remote.
[219:50.54]I now need to put this on him.
[219:51.60]We need to get a thing.
[219:53.12]We need to do the receipt and the ring.
[220:00.84]I'm rolling now.
[220:06.86]Why am I from Boston?
[220:08.24]Because my two parents decided that they were going to live there, and then they had me as a child.
[220:20.30]What else do you want?
[220:20.92]Alright.
[220:27.79]Nothing?
[220:28.11]How is that nothing?
[220:37.51]That's a receipt in a ring.
[220:38.75]It's not the receipt for the ring?
[220:41.09]Is it a cell phone bill?
[220:53.38]If Stinky went somewhere to meet Skunk,
[221:27.85]General Skunkave could be anywhere in the city.
[221:30.13]He could have at least left a forwarding address or a phone number.
[221:38.52]Damn it, I thought that was going to be it.
[221:43.50]Give me a hint, Max.
[221:45.07]I think you could use a good stomach workout, Sam.
[221:47.65]Lose weight the stinky way.
[221:49.67]Purging does tighten up those abs, I'll give you that.
[221:55.25]Sybil sent us a postcard.
[221:56.87]She and the giant stone head of Abraham Lincoln are still on their extended honeymoon.
[222:01.19]And you said their marriage wouldn't last.
[222:03.77]Actually, I said it was a violation of the laws of nature and most major religions.
[222:06.95]I think it does it automatically.
[222:10.94]see you max keep in touch where would I find so this is one of skunk ape's minions left behind this torn receipt for a toy store this is the note this is the phone this is the ring this is the just turn it off what happens when you don't want to use that until skunk ape is nearby you can't hear me
[222:47.25]Is there anywhere else I can go?
[222:48.91]My mic is not muted, I can see it right here.
[222:52.12]Literally, I'm not going to sniff the webcam either, so get that out of your vocabulary.
[223:18.50]What else am I missing?
[223:19.44]I feel like it's something to do with the liquidation machine.
[223:30.56]Can I shut down the liquidation machine?
[223:46.40]Let Otto sniff the camera.
[223:48.24]No, Otto's in bed.
[223:52.66]Put the cam on your head like a GoPro.
[223:58.97]How am I gonna hold it there?
[223:59.99]Am I missing something in here?
[224:06.13]Anything at all?
[224:10.02]Should I, like, turn this on?
[224:13.00]So you're suggesting we trap Skunk Ape in our own building?
[224:16.22]Well, kind of.
[224:17.40]You'd actually be turning your building into an alternate dimension.
[224:20.98]So it won't really exist anymore.
[224:22.66]So how do we get into our building?
[224:27.15]Gotta get... Okay, we gotta get into our building.
[224:29.47]Hold on.
[224:41.79]Stick it to the grease on your forehead.
[224:43.84]Just ban that person for life, please.
[224:57.66]I hope they finish the repair work on our building soon.
[225:00.18]I miss taking showers.
[225:01.86]We could just give ourselves tongue baths like cats and flight attendants do.
[225:06.18]Well, okay, I guess.
[225:08.10]Just be careful around the back of my neck.
[225:09.85]That's where I'm most prone to thyroid.
[225:11.35]I have moist, healthy skin.
[225:12.83]That means I'm healthy.
[225:13.85]That means I'm very moist.
[225:15.56]I have lots of collagen, I've got lots of elasticity.
[225:18.80]I'm very moisturized.
[225:20.38]I think.
[225:25.11]No, no, no, no, no!
[225:44.59]Max, no!
[225:45.59]Not the Chrysler building!
[225:46.88]That sounds fun!
[225:48.96]I can hardly wait!
[225:49.78]What?
[225:51.50]What the... the fuck are you talking about?
[225:58.68]You're biting my lip again.
[226:01.24]Thinking too hard.
[226:02.32]Alright.
[226:09.21]I'm very obviously missing something important.
[226:13.56]What am I missing?
[226:16.32]Where have I not been?
[226:21.27]I haven't been down here in a little while.
[226:29.09]I haven't been down here in a while.
[226:30.22]Yeah, let's just see.
[226:40.43]You could be anywhere in the city.
[226:42.73]Rosemary keeps wandering off and leaving this thing behind.
[226:54.62]We've already seen this.
[226:59.96]Anything at all.
[227:00.56]Any... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[227:03.57]There's nobody there anymore.
[227:09.48]Oh, fuck.
[227:11.15]Can I go in the hole and then walk down this way?
[227:18.47]No, I can't cross the game cartridges, I don't think.
[227:23.77]I can come down here, but I can't go this way.
[227:27.82]Don't know where Charlie is.
[227:29.76]Let me look at the future.
[227:43.22]Oh, that's unpleasant.
[227:51.81]Well, how do I get in there?
[227:52.65]Probably.
[227:52.89]You're not going to give me anything else?
[227:53.77]That's all I'm going to get?
[228:13.12]that we eventually just come out?
[228:15.76]Wouldn't you like to know?
[228:17.42]Next train, wouldn't you like to know?
[228:25.29]So I obviously have to... Alright, there's only two holes.
[228:34.59]General Skunkit could be anywhere in the city.
[228:36.88]He could have at least left a forwarding address or a phone number.
[228:39.60]Let's go teleport to... But he didn't want to go in that hole.
[228:45.13]The hole in Mama Bosco is... He's like, I'm not going in there.
[228:48.91]That sounds... I don't want to be down there.
[228:51.59]Right?
[228:51.81]He said something like that.
[228:57.96]No, fuck.
[228:58.52]Don't do that.
[229:00.84]No, no, no.
[229:01.30]What happened?
[229:09.20]I have yellow lights on right now.
[229:12.70]I thought these were, like, green.
[229:23.20]Okay.
[229:23.94]Will you go in here now?
[229:27.56]Harry must have dug his way in here.
[229:29.62]They say they don't like to be in bright sunlight, but I say it's just an excuse to do more property damage.
[229:34.99]Brilliant excuse.
[229:35.75]Throw the phone down there?
[229:38.19]Harry must have... Throw the phone in there.
[229:43.61]I don't want to toss this thing around.
[229:44.99]I might break it.
[229:46.27]General Skunk Ape could be anywhere in the city.
[229:48.55]He could have at least left a forwarding address or a phone number.
[229:52.39]fuck it's gotta be something with this thing is too complicated I thought that was it I thought I could throw it down there and teleport to it it's mama bosco's dimensional destabilizer thing
[230:34.54]Teleportation.
[230:48.36]I can't collect the ectoplasm.
[230:49.72]I don't know.
[230:52.78]Wee-hoo-hoo!
[231:00.51]Nothing out here?
[231:01.13]Nothing in an alleyway or something?
[231:04.78]Did I look everywhere?
[231:14.70]It's not these two.
[231:16.77]It's not the phone.
[231:24.13]Give the phone to somebody?
[231:27.03]Should I give the phone to Mama Bosco?
[231:31.93]I don't know.
[231:32.37]I have no idea what he wants me to do.
[231:37.52]I'm missing, apparently I'm missing evidence of some sort.
[231:43.06]This is obviously the ring that he's going to hold onto this.
[231:45.16]Let's see.
[231:51.27]If he's just sitting in the diner, I'm going to be so angry.
[232:01.95]He's just ordering food at the diner.
[232:10.38]And I've been looking around for the clues and shit trying to find him.
[232:13.62]He's gonna be eating food at the diner.
[232:16.40]I really thought that was gonna be the thing.
[232:25.24]Not even the freelance police can put me in a bad mood today.
[232:29.20]Do your worst.
[232:32.01]Oh, you thing!
[232:33.75]Hehe, it is pretty cool, isn't it?
[232:36.81]But don't touch!
[232:37.73]And no animals on the counter!
[232:39.55]I need that.
[232:41.21]That's the homing beacon.
[232:42.35]Alright, thank you.
[232:44.05]Isn't that brooch a little fancy pants for you, God of Stinky?
[232:47.29]It ain't a brooch, you cretin!
[232:49.65]It's a badge of honor!
[232:51.59]General Skunkoppy was so grateful for my donation that he made me his second-in-command!
[233:01.02]That badge looks dangerous, Grandpa Stinky.
[233:03.84]You'd better let us have it.
[233:05.44]Let you have it?
[233:07.50]This badge gives me command over General Skunkapi's entire Fifth Legion and Outer Dominions.
[233:14.40]I'm not gonna give it to the likes of you.
[233:16.62]Where are his Outer Dominions exactly?
[233:19.29]I don't know.
[233:20.41]He told me to command them from inside the diner.
[233:23.77]I think it stretches from Alpha Centauri to the Andromeda Galaxy.
[233:29.73]And Brooklyn, of course.
[233:30.91]Oh no, I'm gonna yawn.
[233:32.33]No, why am I yawning?
[233:39.74]That's not because of the game.
[233:44.71]I promise.
[233:49.20]I just want a badge.
[233:50.04]That's not because of not having a fun time.
[233:52.30]Can't we just borrow your badge?
[233:53.91]That's not because of not having a fun time.
[233:55.05]Even if you want a couple of shiftless ape traitors, my captain ordered me never to take it off.
[234:02.13]And to keep at least 50 feet away from him at all times.
[234:06.02]So if I press this thing, will he get sucked up?
[234:11.68]How's life as a multi-millionaire, Grandpa Stinky?
[234:14.38]So, you're starting to regret handing over that ticket, are you?
[234:19.21]I almost feel bad taking it from you, but consider it a life lesson.
[234:24.95]You're gonna be a lot more clever to outsmart an old salt like Stinky.
[234:29.80]What are you gonna do with all the money?
[234:31.94]Oh, I already gave it away.
[234:33.66]you what gave it away generals couldn't copy haven't you heard him talk about the big plans he has for the planet and since he made me his second in command I never have to worry about money again alright you just gave away hundreds of millions of dollars to an alien gorilla
[234:55.50]Make it sound like I didn't get anything in return.
[234:58.50]I got this badge and command of an entire alien fleet.
[235:03.26]That is pretty cool, Sam.
[235:04.94]That was a JoJo pose.
[235:06.25]Especially if you threw in the badge.
[235:13.29]We've had a sudden change of heart.
[235:14.69]We think Skunk Ape is awesome.
[235:16.85]Where do we sign up to join the Skunk Ape army?
[235:19.33]You two?
[235:20.63]In the Skunk Ape army?
[235:22.90]Don't make me laugh.
[235:24.96]Heh heh heh heh heh.
[235:56.20]Not making a whole lot of noise.
[235:57.26]He got the badge and the command.
[236:00.88]Yeah.
[236:15.62]Alright, we already had that.
[236:16.36]Alright, so we love Skunk Ape.
[236:18.56]You really want to join the Skunk Ape army, Grandpa Stinky?
[236:21.73]Max needs to pay for college.
[236:23.77]Why don't you ladies run back to your knitting and scrapbooking and leave the army work to the real men and gorillas?
[236:33.35]That does it!
[236:39.67]Where is he?
[236:42.29]Where is he?
[237:07.21]We have to play the back and forth here.
[237:08.39]Come on, Grandpa Stinky.
[237:09.41]Let us in the Skunk Ape army.
[237:11.15]As soon as we drop the weight, height, and competency requirements, I'll get back to you.
[237:17.90]Take it back!
[237:19.56]He's going after him again.
[237:20.40]Okay, he's... Settle down, Max.
[237:26.19]General Skunk Ape's got you brainwashed, Grandpa Stinky.
[237:29.31]Yeah, and he hung you out to dry to avoid further shrinkage.
[237:33.85]Ha!
[237:34.67]You gentle, free-loving, hippie peacenik types just can't appreciate a real leader who's not afraid to use his weapons.
[237:44.53]He really doesn't know us at all, does he?
[237:48.94]This is your last warning, Grandpa.
[237:51.04]We're taking down the whole skunk ape army.
[237:53.38]Don't forget who you're talking to, traitors.
[237:56.82]As long as I wear this badge, my loyalty is with the general.
[238:01.52]Hold on.
[238:04.39]okay this is your last warning for real we're taking down the whole skunk ape army don't forget who you're talking to traitors as long as I wear this bodge my loyalty is with the general I don't think I can okay this is come on grip take it back here we go can I teleport
[238:36.82]no I can't when he's yeah he's like touching me settle down max can't we just borrow your badge all hail skunk ape peace through destruction I don't want to use that until skunk ape is nearby what are you talking what are you talking about use the thing what do you mean
[239:04.85]Hold on, I can back out while they're talking?
[239:08.19]I thought this was part of a dialog sequence.
[239:12.70]Why can't I just use it here?
[239:23.12]I'd better get out of here before things get violent.
[239:26.58]Yeah, but I thought this was, like, part of the... I thought this is all, like, enclosed in a dialog sequence.
[239:32.71]I didn't know that... I thought backing out would just pull them out, too.
[239:35.17]Teleportation.
[239:43.17]I thought that was just part of... Like, this is... You're in the dialog sequence now.
[239:46.51]Backing out means just walking away.
[239:48.69]Like, with everybody.
[239:52.61]Alright, now let's, um...
[239:56.37]Where should I bring him?
[240:02.20]Bring him to the tech room?
[240:05.26]Bring him to Stinky?
[240:06.14]Put him in my pocket?
[240:11.30]What happens if I do this?
[240:18.01]I mean, you probably would want to just get him in the... The cell phone has to be in the...
[240:25.30]Let's just see what happens.
[240:26.02]Let's go to Boss Coast.
[240:26.78]I feel like... Do I have to put him in the machine, maybe?
[240:37.37]Jerks.
[240:46.71]Alright, well... We gotta go... I think I have to bring him into the incinerator.
[240:53.94]And then be like, give us the badge or you're not getting out.
[241:00.06]That's what I'm going to try to do.
[241:05.93]He's just mildly inconvenienced.
[241:18.10]But we have to go in there first.
[241:20.06]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[241:20.76]I've got to do this in the right order.
[241:24.47]Right?
[241:25.23]I need to go put the cell phone in the thing.
[241:31.16]So we have to go back to... Because the phone has to be in the thing.
[241:35.86]I feel like that's not going to work, though.
[241:40.14]I don't think that's going to work.
[241:48.20]But, I mean, whatever.
[241:48.94]I'm just going to try it.
[241:52.27]I'm just going to try it.
[241:58.70]Let's go put the phone in the thing.
[242:04.78]Bring him in there and see what happens.
[242:13.49]Back upstairs.
[242:22.20]Can you open this door again, please?
[242:28.05]Welcome back.
[242:30.29]You'll feel a slight tingle as we take your personal items for safekeeping.
[242:35.02]Please do.
[242:35.52]Take it.
[242:37.10]Mm-hmm.
[242:41.76]Make a joke about how, uh, where is it?
[242:46.98]Alright, out.
[242:47.62]Teleportation.
[242:51.71]And in.
[242:58.67]Because the last time I tried to do this, the gorilla ran out.
[243:05.47]I wonder if that happens here, too.
[243:07.29]We'll find out.
[243:08.59]Whee!
[243:09.41]Alright, grab me.
[243:15.06]Let's best make this quick.
[243:23.09]Come on, Grandpa Stinky.
[243:25.79]Take it.
[243:27.65]Here we go.
[243:30.29]I'd better get out.
[243:33.57]Let's see if it works.
[243:34.77]Three, two, one, action.
[243:46.77]Your hands off me!
[243:49.57]What have ye done?
[243:51.45]Welcome back.
[243:52.69]Thank you for bringing friends along to celebrate the benevolence of General Skunkope.
[243:58.32]You'll feel a slight tingle as we take your personal items for safekeeping.
[244:02.66]No one's taking my personal gold and griddles!
[244:08.00]For the comfort of guests waiting outside, please refrain from screaming or crying out.
[244:15.78]So he's not going to remember that it's in there.
[244:18.42]Don't go in that case.
[244:20.48]Good.
[244:21.04]I now have all the things I need.
[244:24.25]We can end this.
[244:47.03]Take it all.
[244:52.49]Looks like Grandpa Stinky's stuff got mixed in with all of mine.
[244:55.81]What's he got in his pockets?
[244:58.49]His victory badge from Skunk Ape and... Jackpot!
[245:02.29]A collectible shot glass from Mista Pizza!
[245:08.91]Cool.
[245:12.95]Wait, I actually need to use this?
[245:16.97]shot glass and I wonder what.
[245:22.71]Well now that I have this stuff, let's go back.
[245:25.54]What do I need the shot glass for?
[245:32.82]Can I s- hold on.
[245:35.84]This is important.
[245:51.47]I've got the items.
[245:53.13]I just need... Let me see.
[245:55.57]Hold on.
[245:55.89]Wait, wait, wait.
[245:56.69]Let's see if I can do it.
[245:59.73]Worth a shot.
[246:05.47]I'd better keep this.
[246:06.71]It could be an important clue in our case.
[246:09.71]No?
[246:10.73]Damn it.
[246:13.15]Where's the, like, liquid?
[246:14.49]Is there liquid I can grab or scrape or drink or eat?
[246:22.24]I got the thing!
[246:23.12]Alright.
[246:23.52]I have so many of these items, but none of them are together.
[246:29.76]Shot glass, receipt, ring, note.
[246:58.60]Liquid.
[247:33.66]propose to Max.
[247:34.70]I've tried it like 10 times, it doesn't do anything.
[247:40.02]General Skunk Ape could be anywhere in the city.
[247:42.29]He could have at least left a forwarding address or a phone number.
[247:49.69]Skunk Ape must have been at a Mista Pizza, but how can we know which one?
[247:53.87]Is this a pizza receipt?
[248:05.89]No, that's not a pizza.
[248:08.73]Shot glass and... Skunk Ape must have been at a Mista Pizza.
[248:14.56]But how can we know which one?
[248:19.46]Shot glass, pizza, phone number from the pizza place?
[248:23.19]There's a pizza place in here?
[248:24.89]Stinky went somewhere to meet Skunk Ape.
[248:28.03]You've discovered a new location.
[248:42.68]Alright, let's go.
[248:52.83]Mista pizza.
[248:53.39]Skunk Ape was here 20, no, 28 minutes ago.
[248:59.37]He should really get more fiber in his diet.
[249:02.32]So, where at?
[249:03.80]Mista Pizza.
[249:07.52]Let's put the 3D glasses on.
[249:13.20]And let's see what this looks like.
[249:20.45]Okay, here we are.
[249:21.69]Good work, Max.
[249:22.97]Now, let's see if we can... Aha!
[249:25.41]A clue!
[249:27.23]Get on the roof.
[249:29.12]Step one.
[249:32.43]Step two.
[249:34.71]Leave the restaurant.
[249:35.47]Were we supposed to be looking for clues or something?
[249:40.25]Step three.
[249:40.87]Good work, Max.
[249:42.17]Now let's see if we can... Aha!
[249:44.58]A clue!
[249:45.12]Get on the roof.
[249:47.76]And... Swallowed whole.
[249:52.96]I've never seen anything like that before.
[249:55.88]Bird... The bird eats something.
[249:58.19]Bird eats pizza?
[250:00.09]Out of the box?
[250:02.45]So I gotta throw pizza off the roof.
[250:09.44]Let's go in.
[250:24.82]Oh, come on.
[250:25.62]You can't get taste like that from real cheese.
[250:27.88]Uh, were we supposed to be looking for clues or something?
[250:30.86]Uh, you want to know something disgusting that I've been doing lately?
[250:33.61]It's not even disgusting, it's alright.
[250:37.43]I don't do this every day.
[250:39.29]But I take, you know that easy cheese from the can?
[250:41.99]So what you do is you get the just standard regular just orange easy cheese.
[250:48.08]Don't get the other ones.
[250:50.38]Get a bag of pretzels.
[250:52.24]Just the little ones.
[250:53.12]The little like twisty pretzel things for like the hard ones that you get at the grocery store.
[250:58.45]And then trace with the easy cheese the pretzel
[251:04.07]So it's coated.
[251:05.27]Eat it.
[251:06.43]It's really, really good.
[251:08.53]It's very good.
[251:09.31]Maybe later.
[251:10.09]Alright, let me see the pizza box.
[251:11.25]We've talked about this before with pretzels.
[251:30.95]Okay, same scenario.
[251:32.04]Just listen to me.
[251:33.42]People are gonna think I'm crazy and people think I'm gross.
[251:37.64]But just listen.
[251:39.76]Make tuna fish with like a tuna salad almost.
[251:42.92]Like a mayonnaise with the tuna.
[251:45.40]Take pretzels and dunk them into the tuna fish and eat them.
[251:49.36]Just do it.
[251:51.35]One day you're gonna wake up and be like, you know what?
[251:53.05]Fuck this guy.
[251:54.11]He's an idiot.
[251:54.81]I'm gonna just do it so I can be mad at him in the next stream.
[251:57.53]Do it.
[251:57.75]I want you to do it and then tell me how it was.
[252:02.58]It's locked, broken, and doesn't go anywhere we want to go.
[252:05.82]Just like our socialite.
[252:08.10]It's not, I know, you might think it's crazy, but it's not crazy.
[252:11.04]There's something with the combination of the enzymes in the tuna and the pretzel dough that makes it... Why am I even telling you this?
[252:19.76]I should just make a fucking flavor out of it.
[252:21.74]Alright, can I get up there?
[252:23.49]Mr. Pizza, for the unforgettable taste of old nipples.
[252:26.77]Uh, isn't that supposed to be Old Naples?
[252:29.33]They had to change it on account of truth in advertising laws.
[252:34.36]Alright, so, uh, what about in the... Can't go in there.
[252:38.62]Gonna go around the other side of the building.
[252:47.34]Gotta get on the roof.
[252:55.24]Is there a fire escape room?
[253:00.00]Spend time with pigeons.
[253:04.24]Looks like this little fella's had his fill of Mista Pizza's rotting remnants for one day.
[253:08.09]Can I poke his belly with a pencil and make him explode in a horrific shower of dough and anchovies?
[253:13.49]Maybe later.
[253:13.95]Alright, what about nothing else I can do with the pizza boxes?
[253:25.07]These boxes have been picked clean.
[253:26.57]The pigeons carry the wood-like crusts away to build nests and primitive temples to their pigeon god.
[253:40.86]Also, no, you know what?
[253:45.15]I'm not going to give you my culinary secrets anymore.
[253:54.40]Why would I tell you that when you take a hard pretzel and you put it in your mouth and you like suck on it for a second and then you smell it, it's like one of the greatest smells you'll ever smell in your whole life.
[254:05.17]Why would I tell you that?
[254:06.21]Because that's a fucking culinary secret.
[254:09.38]Looks like this little fella's had his fill of Mr. Pizza's rotting remnants for one day.
[254:13.26]Just do it.
[254:13.92]Just do it.
[254:14.50]You're gonna do it one day.
[254:15.72]You're gonna do it one day.
[254:17.88]And you're gonna... I don't care.
[254:18.84]You don't have to say anything.
[254:19.99]You don't have to come to the stream and be like, you were right and that was fucking really ridiculous.
[254:24.01]One day you're just gonna be sitting on the fucking couch.
[254:25.87]You're gonna be eating a pretzel and you're gonna go, fuck that boomer.
[254:28.49]And you're gonna go, holy fuck.
[254:32.65]I don't even need to know.
[254:33.57]I don't need to be there.
[254:34.51]I'm fine with that.
[254:45.60]I just need to... I just... As long as I know that somebody's going to do that, I'll be happy.
[254:53.91]Can I do this?
[254:56.41]Can I put this in here?
[255:01.88]That's so... And then the bird picks it.
[255:05.10]That's like... This is all so specific.
[255:06.30]Are you calling somebody?
[255:09.65]Swallowed whole.
[255:10.95]I've never seen anything like that before.
[255:12.15]The bird's not going to eat.
[255:12.75]Alright.
[255:13.05]Not since we accidentally wandered into that theater on Times Square.
[255:31.59]That's reaching.
[255:33.21]That is like reaching.
[255:38.89]You believe in time travel, but you don't believe in a pigeon eating a phone.
[255:44.16]No, I don't.
[255:46.26]I don't believe in that at all.
[255:48.58]If the pigeon was, like, fucking two to three feet tall, maybe.
[255:59.44]Good work, Max.
[256:00.72]Now, let's see if we can... Aha!
[256:03.18]A clue.
[256:03.82]Oh, that's one way to eat up data.
[256:06.18]I didn't say that.
[256:06.86]Somebody who collects old, rare toys.
[256:09.38]What's the address?
[256:10.14]I don't know, Max.
[256:11.56]The name and most of the address are smudged out.
[256:14.34]This looks like a job for the Climetron.
[256:18.36]And pick up that phone, Max.
[256:19.60]I'm not touching it.
[256:21.00]I've got the toy receipt.
[256:22.18]I've got the toy address.
[256:23.44]Look at that.
[256:30.71]It's a vintage postcard from a collector of rare toys, but the address has been smudged out.
[256:35.29]And I've got a receipt.
[256:37.09]Let's go.
[256:48.75]Receipt and this.
[256:50.59]This postcard is from somebody who collects...
[257:03.43]Scan complete.
[257:04.59]New location unlocked.
[257:06.53]Pawn shop.
[257:13.97]I live on tuna and egg salad.
[257:18.70]Those things are both very, very good.
[257:20.04]Intergalactic warlord business must be in a real slump if Skunk Ape is having to hit the pawn shops.
[257:25.06]He's tracking down magic toys, Max, and he must have found something inside if he left Gruesome there to guard the door.
[257:31.86]Intrigue!
[257:33.84]Okay.
[257:37.44]Everybody also says that mayo is gross, too.
[257:39.82]What?
[257:40.50]It's... I could go off on a long one here.
[257:45.43]Mayo is just fat.
[257:47.83]As humans, we desire the taste of a few different things.
[257:53.43]Salt, fat, and sweet.
[257:55.37]That's what you, when you bite into like a hamburger, or when you bite into a piece of pizza, you want that salt or that fat or sweet.
[258:03.21]You have like three desires in your entire life.
[258:06.75]So mayo is just one third of all of your food desires in a jar.
[258:14.99]But somehow it's disgusting, somehow.
[258:18.47]What?
[258:21.29]How does that make any sense?
[258:26.23]You don't have to, like, eat it out of the jar.
[258:34.72]What are we doing here?
[258:35.46]Oh yeah, the collector of small goods or whatever it is.
[258:38.18]Pawn shop.
[258:39.20]Would you like to know what magical surprises are in your future?
[258:42.39]My friend here is a trained psychic.
[258:44.47]Hey, call me now for your free reading!
[258:49.69]Thanks for the biology refresher Can I just like stick this in him?
[258:58.37]Let's take a look with the goggles Oldest trick in the book There's a lot of old tricks in lots of different books
[259:16.10]Skunk Ape must have tossed it out when he realized it wasn't magical.
[259:19.18]We've got to find what store he got it from.
[259:20.96]Okay, so he's got to get thrown into the sewer, right?
[259:27.61]Uh-huh.
[259:28.41]A banana peel.
[259:28.97]Put him in the trash can.
[259:29.77]Alright, get the banana peel from there.
[259:32.39]Put it over here.
[259:32.87]He slips down into the little... I could have totally carried that heavy thing a lot farther.
[259:36.83]I just didn't feel like it.
[259:39.39]Alright, I got it.
[259:39.99]It's already done.
[259:41.37]Bingo.
[259:41.63]Out.
[259:42.42]Out.
[259:47.43]Guys, trust me.
[259:48.27]This looks entirely too safe.
[259:49.53]Suck on some mayo and scoop it out.
[259:50.71]I'm not, whatever.
[259:51.57]Couldn't smell it.
[259:52.25]That's, no.
[259:54.09]It's fine.
[259:54.55]It's okay.
[259:55.55]You're going to do it at some point.
[259:59.23]I could have totally carried that heavy thing a lot farther.
[260:01.83]I just didn't feel like it.
[260:05.09]I just tried it with a pretzel cracker.
[260:06.77]It just smelled.
[260:07.27]No, no, no.
[260:07.57]You got to do it with a hard pretzel, not a cracker.
[260:10.03]Uh-huh.
[260:14.44]A banana peel.
[260:20.17]You know how good... I can't talk about food.
[260:24.13]I'll end the stream.
[260:32.55]Down with Skunk Ape.
[260:33.97]Aliens go home.
[260:35.89]Hey.
[260:38.39]You guys really shouldn't be littering.
[260:42.40]Surprise!
[260:45.62]Oldest trick in the book.
[260:50.37]Your ears would be ringing.
[260:53.67]Yeah, don't litter.
[260:55.37]Littering is actually bad.
[260:56.37]Don't do it.
[261:02.45]This goes deep into the fiery bowels of America's filthiest city.
[261:06.40]You've been listening to my inner bathroom narration again.
[261:08.80]Alright, so we can go in now.
[261:14.22]Nothing else over here.
[261:15.16]Let's look at the pawn shop.
[261:16.88]I think one of us should try to smash through that window with his rock-hard, melon-sized head.
[261:21.34]And I think one of us should try the door, unless he wants to spend the rest of the day picking plate glass out of his partner's fluffy white nether regions.
[261:28.40]You've had an aioli before?
[261:30.67]That's mayonnaise.
[261:33.65]Somebody's eating, like, an aioli on their sandwich, and they just spit it out because they couldn't believe it.
[261:41.25]A paddle ball toy?
[261:42.72]Skunk Ape must have tossed it out when he realized it wasn't magical.
[261:45.80]We've got to find what store he got it from.
[261:49.78]Now the receipt.
[261:50.74]Receipt and the paddle ball.
[261:59.44]What's my opinion on chili powder and lime juice?
[262:02.30]I haven't done it.
[262:08.25]Chili and lime goes together really well.
[262:10.21]I'm sure it's just not personally done.
[262:11.75]This receipt's only got part of an address, but not the name of the... Success!
[262:17.40]A new destination has been revealed on your platform.
[262:19.50]How much more is in this?
[262:24.58]These episodes feel longer.
[262:25.70]Are they longer?
[262:32.63]Yes, they are.
[262:34.74]How are we ever going to find Skunk Ape, Sam?
[262:37.18]All these streets look the same.
[262:39.14]Shut up, Max.
[262:40.15]They're completely different streets.
[262:42.27]It's Mole Men.
[262:43.87]Generals can copy a sweating Mole Men.
[262:47.99]Spoiler warning, Harry.
[262:50.17]Sheesh.
[262:52.09]Smash your cell phones.
[262:53.45]That's how he controls you.
[262:56.38]It's Mole Men.
[262:57.98]Generals can copy a sweating Mole Men.
[263:02.27]All clues lead here, but no sign of Skunk Ape.
[263:05.11]Where is Skunk Ape?
[263:06.68]Aha!
[263:07.62]New York's lackadaisical business hours win again.
[263:10.92]But Skunk Ape will be back any second, little buddy.
[263:13.48]We'd better be ready for him.
[263:14.76]Taco Bell.
[263:15.24]What are we gonna do once he shows up?
[263:16.76]Wendy's.
[263:17.54]I don't know yet.
[263:18.98]McDonald's.
[263:21.02]Taco Bell, Wendy's, McDonald's, and then... Dairy Queen, Baskin Robbins, Burger King.
[263:31.55]No.
[263:31.93]Shake Shack.
[263:34.69]Shake Shack.
[263:35.31]Taco Bell Shake Shack.
[263:38.51]Five Guys.
[263:42.64]McDonald's.
[263:44.36]Burger King.
[263:45.10]Baskin Robbins.
[263:45.90]Dairy Queen.
[263:48.24]Wendy's is up here.
[263:49.70]Do a tier list.
[263:50.70]There's a website where I can... Really?
[263:55.16]Oh, that's right.
[263:56.00]There is that tier list website.
[264:02.26]Alright.
[264:07.06]He's never going to finish this game.
[264:16.51]How late to the bandwagon am I on doing tier lists on stream?
[264:24.93]Am I like six months late?
[264:27.93]That's so funny.
[264:30.46]Always do things way after anybody cares about them anymore.
[264:33.56]That's my motto, right?
[264:43.34]It's the paddle thing.
[264:45.02]In the future, all these toys are still here, unbought and unloved.
[264:48.85]That's kind of sad.
[264:50.35]It's their own fault for not being more fun.
[264:52.77]It's not a welfare state, Sam.
[264:54.73]Everybody, mute if you don't want to hear a spoiler.
[264:56.53]Mute.
[264:56.99]Mute right now if you don't want to hear a spoiler.
[264:59.67]Don't mute.
[265:01.01]No, no, no.
[265:01.74]Stay unmuted.
[265:03.20]When I go like this, that means it's okay.
[265:05.80]Okay?
[265:07.20]So I'm going to give a huge spoiler.
[265:08.80]If you don't want to hear a spoiler, then... No, that's movie's tune, dude.
[265:12.70]Never mind.
[265:15.49]I'll put it in another chat.
[265:16.51]No, that's... No, I don't want to do that.
[265:19.79]Ha, ha, ha.
[265:21.05]So you have found me at last, freelance police.
[265:24.67]That will make everything so much easier.
[265:28.80]And you have brought the elusive toy right to me, yes.
[265:33.67]No, that wasn't a joke.
[265:35.49]I was actually going to say, like, a bunch of spoilers.
[265:40.07]Uh-oh.
[265:41.57]So you have found me at last, freelance police.
[265:45.21]That will make everything so much easier.
[265:48.12]Wait, what?
[265:48.80]Hold on.
[265:49.58]And you have brought the elusive toy right to me, yes.
[265:54.72]That was just happening.
[265:56.64]Okay.
[265:58.59]Oh no, they did the double bop!
[266:07.24]Engines to full power!
[266:09.76]Yes!
[266:11.48]Destroy the city!
[266:14.52]Oh, come back!
[266:15.32]Come back, you're fine.
[266:16.94]Look familiar?
[266:18.58]I certainly hope that you are paying attention, my friends.
[266:21.83]Because our story seems to have hurtled to its inevitable conclusion.
[266:26.88]No longer can you blindly mash buttons to unleash a torrent of irreverent banter and comic mischief.
[266:34.05]Now you are all that stands in the way of the total annihilation of the planet Earth.
[266:40.19]The villain has made his move.
[266:42.17]The players are yours to command.
[266:44.64]Only you can return General Scuncape to the Penal Zone.
[266:54.14]Take that!
[267:04.96]I better keep this.
[267:06.16]Throw it over to Sybil.
[267:16.55]That won't do any good.
[267:17.63]Stinky's right here with us.
[267:22.24]We can't leave the spaceship now.
[267:23.73]There's still so much egg-swarding to do.
[267:26.23]We can't leave the spaceship now.
[267:28.53]We can't leave.
[267:29.49]We can't leave.
[267:30.81]That won't do any good.
[267:34.83]Full power to right mandible.
[267:37.47]Yes.
[267:40.73]That won't work.
[267:42.03]Drink the water.
[267:47.05]Sam and Max, don't tell me Skunkope wants you guys to be his love slaves too.
[267:52.81]You'd be surprised just how many fetishes there are that involve Sam and me.
[267:56.87]What are you doing locked in here, Stinky?
[267:59.03]I've got no idea.
[268:00.23]I assumed it was Grandpa Stinky's fault.
[268:07.79]Did you lose your cell phone?
[268:09.80]No signal.
[268:10.14]But throw that phone...
[268:40.10]Throw that phone out there so we can teleport out of the cell.
[268:42.22]Yeah, isn't Skunk Ape your boyfriend?
[268:43.98]Ew.
[268:45.60]He wishes.
[268:46.48]He is so not my type.
[268:48.48]You only have to date an evil gorilla once to learn never to make that mistake again.
[268:53.05]Just slide up there and we'll teleport out.
[268:59.51]What are we doing here?
[269:01.37]How is this Grandpa Stinky's fault?
[269:03.36]He's been going on and on about Skunk Ape ever since he landed.
[269:07.36]That's the kind of gentleman you should get involved with.
[269:09.61]He's got a future.
[269:10.65]Skunk Ape's a jerk.
[269:14.79]You gotta stay away from Skunk Ape.
[269:16.57]The guy's a total butthorn.
[269:18.39]You're telling me?
[269:19.19]I was just going to meet my... to meet a friend at the top of the Empire State Building.
[269:23.19]Then all of a sudden this giant gorilla shows up and carries me off to be his queen or something.
[269:27.66]Gee, I think a hyper-intelligent alien could have come up with something more original.
[269:32.11]I'm not buying this super advanced technology business if they haven't even mastered the technique of margaritas and unexpected car trouble.
[269:38.79]You know, I don't think I've ever had a margarita before in my whole life.
[269:42.97]I think you're being too hard on Skunk Ape.
[269:44.87]He's just misunderstood.
[269:46.92]Oh, yeah?
[269:47.82]Uh, did I misunderstand this picture he sent me?
[269:50.74]Good heavens!
[269:52.14]I think I should put on some clothes now.
[269:54.52]Well, Skunk Ape's got a lot of good points, too.
[269:57.14]Name one.
[269:59.54]He's got a couple of good qualities.
[270:01.36]He's got a... He's got his own spaceship.
[270:03.62]I noticed.
[270:04.44]That may impress you boys, but... I have the keys to your cage, so he could let you out.
[270:08.24]But then she wouldn't be able to talk to us anymore.
[270:11.01]Yoo-hoo!
[270:16.29]General Skunkape!
[270:24.19]We're all set, Max.
[270:25.37]Now we've just got to get out of this cage so we can wrap this case up once and for all.
[270:29.23]Take that!
[270:37.54]Die, earthlings.
[270:39.44]Die!
[270:44.59]Ding.
[270:44.95]Let's go.
[270:51.66]Turn to the plant.
[270:52.80]Well done, freelance police.
[270:55.06]Now you must place the homing beacon on Skunkape's back to trap him in the beetle zone.
[271:02.08]We're on it.
[271:03.04]Now light up those toys.
[271:07.07]The hell?
[271:08.37]Looking for these.
[271:10.41]Oh, he looked through his 3D glasses and saw the picture.
[271:13.03]Your future viewer has proven to be most enlightened.
[271:19.36]Here, use it to witness how I'm going to destroy you.
[271:24.68]So, what was our plan B again?
[271:27.44]I believe you planned to turn on the dimensional destabilizer, yes?
[271:33.58]Luckily, I have my own.
[271:36.56]But I've still got the homing beacon.
[271:38.72]Exactly.
[271:39.80]Uh oh.
[271:50.90]Can you believe that guy?
[271:52.58]Skunk Ape knew what we were going to do the whole time.
[271:56.18]He just wanted to rub our noses in the penal zone.
[271:58.58]It's a FromSoftware Endgame level.
[272:00.98]What do we do?
[272:02.32]You're not supposed to, Max.
[272:03.76]It's a horrible plane of nonexistence forever trapped between reality and unreality.
[272:08.48]Yeah, that and also that beeping noise is really getting on my nerves.
[272:13.43]Turn around, Max.
[272:15.75]Skunk Ape strapped an anti-matter bomb on your back while we were out cold.
[272:19.49]Get rid of it.
[272:26.22]What does it say?
[272:27.64]Jeez, what a jerk.
[272:29.41]We gotta get out of here, Max.
[272:30.67]Pronto.
[272:37.57]If I know my high-tech futuristic explosive devices, this is an anti-matter bomb that will destroy the entire penal zone and anyone inside it.
[272:45.06]And it's gonna go off at any second.
[272:47.14]Really, Sam?
[272:48.34]Any second?
[272:49.66]Well, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit, but still best not to dawdle.
[272:57.63]How did you land?
[272:58.45]How are you up there?
[272:59.05]Alright, what do I do?
[273:00.95]I have whatever items.
[273:01.73]I got the paddle.
[273:02.31]I got the homing beacon.
[273:04.63]I got the shot glass.
[273:05.61]You know, might as well.
[273:08.75]What else is even over here?
[273:10.18]Anything?
[273:10.46]Alright, let's put the homing beacon onto the explosive.
[273:20.48]Nah.
[273:22.86]Let's not put the homing beacon on the explosive.
[273:25.05]Alright, that's not the right thing to do.
[273:26.71]Shot glass.
[273:27.33]I'd better keep this.
[273:28.57]It could be an important clue in our case.
[273:30.71]How about... Can I... Do I still teleport her?
[273:37.89]Oh, shit.
[273:38.25]He didn't take... Wait, hold on.
[273:40.23]What about the future button?
[273:44.62]I thought he would have... I guess he didn't take it.
[274:11.90]I just come back gotcha
[274:28.89]Welcome back, sirs.
[274:29.49]Did she freeze us?
[274:30.97]What just happened?
[274:32.23]I detected a spike in antimatter radiation, so I locked onto the signal from your homing beacon and reversed the polarity of the dimensional stabilization field to intercept... Yeah, yeah.
[274:42.09]Just tell us how we can get back at Skunk Ape for crimes against the Freelance Police and humanity.
[274:47.23]I say let's cover him in candy bar wrappers and feed him to starving raccoons!
[274:51.63]You failed to trap him in the penal zone?
[274:54.11]I wouldn't say failed, exactly.
[274:56.38]Maybe underperformed.
[274:58.12]And we blew up the penal zone with an anti-matter bomb!
[275:01.16]Oh, dear.
[275:03.08]How can I help, Sam and Max?
[275:05.02]Dr. Mamabosco has been granted the fullest security clearance possible for a dead citizen, Mr. President.
[275:12.07]Can't we just use that destabilizer thing to open up another gateway?
[275:16.35]Not now that the penal zone has been destroyed.
[275:20.39]How are we going to stop Skunk Ape now?
[275:22.93]With the penal zone destroyed, we have no way to return him to prison.
[275:26.77]Unless you could make another penal zone somewhere else.
[275:31.90]I smell a convoluted plan coming on.
[275:34.53]with a side order of hand-waving technical nonsense.
[275:37.74]Extra crispy.
[275:38.90]Before I made the destabilizer, I was working on a dimensional rift generator.
[275:43.44]It doesn't open a gateway to another dimension.
[275:45.40]It actually creates another dimension.
[275:48.02]Only problem is, you'll have to find a nexus of ley lines somewhere for it to work.
[275:52.23]A place where the border between reality and nonsense has broken down.
[275:55.77]There happens to be one of those in the city, ma'am.
[275:58.31]It's at 1313 Straight Street.
[276:00.51]That address sounds familiar.
[276:02.83]That's our building.
[276:05.10]What if I put my Minecraft bed?
[276:06.62]Oh, okay.
[276:06.92]Plug it in, press the pedal.
[276:09.92]Alright.
[276:10.31]I'm fine.
[276:10.67]Enough power.
[276:27.32]No, I never did get that back.
[276:29.28]But even so, it would have taken a hundred of those things to give enough power to a dimensional rift generator.
[276:34.59]It's over there, with the other inventions that are a deadly radiation hazard.
[276:40.17]So you're suggesting we trap Skunk Ape in our own building?
[276:43.37]Well, kind of.
[276:44.55]You'd actually be turning your building into an alternate dimension, so it won't really exist anymore.
[276:50.33]I'm afraid it's the only way, sirs.
[276:52.61]On the plus side, if it doesn't exist, think of how much money we'll save on rent.
[276:56.85]We don't pay rent, Max.
[276:59.97]Can't we just use that destabilizer thing to open up another gateway?
[277:03.74]Not now that the penal zone has been destroyed.
[277:05.94]You'll have to use Mama Bosco's Rift Generator to create a new penal zone.
[277:12.48]See you on the other side, Dr. Mama Bosco.
[277:14.46]We're doing a whole lot of this today.
[277:17.85]Put your fucking hands... You know what?
[277:19.37]It's because there's a lot of breaks in between using your hands in the game, so I just... I, like, move them around like a fucking magician.
[277:27.60]I only need one hand to play this, right?
[277:30.66]We'll be careful with your Rift Generator, Mama Bosco.
[277:33.20]Just make sure you don't turn it on until you've got that homing beacon on General Skunkape.
[277:48.08]What the fuck happened here?
[277:57.36]It's like... This is like... I don't want... No, I don't want... I don't want... I don't want you to see what's under here.
[278:06.27]Guys, my mother's that person that puts our name and address as a fucking tag on everything that we own.
[278:12.66]I can't help it.
[278:13.94]On all of my Nintendo games, on all of my fucking electronics.
[278:23.14]I don't, just look what happened.
[278:32.74]It's Mama Bosco's dimensional destabilizer thing.
[278:37.80]Alright, so I gotta do this thing.
[278:41.62]Gotta plug it in, turn it on.
[278:48.30]Bye, guys.
[278:49.55]I'll see you when I fix the fucking universe.
[279:03.92]Eat the rubber.
[279:11.82]I think so.
[279:13.32]I just want to scan some data.
[279:19.04]I want to scan some data.
[279:20.83]Alright, well, so I need to plug this into a power source, and we've got to go to the interdimensional rift that's right outside the... Just go to Sybil's, and there's the rift there.
[279:36.58]I'll just plug it into there.
[279:40.87]I know where to go.
[279:57.08]I'm doing a lot of mouth moving and biting and smacking.
[280:04.65]Can I move?
[280:20.87]I actually have to dodge this stuff?
[280:26.01]Get him to blow something.
[280:26.79]Get him to explode something.
[280:29.05]Blow this up.
[280:30.17]Take this out too.
[280:32.29]And take this out too.
[280:48.65]Alright.
[280:50.81]Take this out.
[280:56.73]Bingo.
[281:02.82]Get in.
[281:05.08]Whoa!
[281:05.26]Alright, now the eyes...
[281:17.18]There's going to be a power source down here that he's going to be able to shoot through the crack down to the power source.
[281:22.56]Plug it in.
[281:34.45]Now we go over here.
[281:36.58]I can teleport to the phone now.
[281:39.56]Just in case everybody was curious about what to do next.
[281:57.29]alright then I was hoping we teleport under an immovable pile of rubble and debris trapped for weeks we'd be forced to resort to cannibalism just to survive you keep coming up with creepy disaster scenarios that always end up with you eating me max it's getting annoying if you don't like it then stop looking so damn tasty can you link me to the watcher you're reading yeah it's uh PC gaming strategy
[282:21.78]It's a good thing Sybil packed all her junk into these boxes for safekeeping.
[282:25.04]Upstairs.
[282:25.48]In here.
[282:32.29]Dot com.
[282:34.83]Can I go?
[282:35.29]Let's go in the mysterious tunnel.
[282:59.13]These episodes are long.
[283:00.15]You guys keep it down.
[283:01.17]We're trying to save the planet here.
[283:02.75]Damn.
[283:03.97]Intruders!
[283:04.80]They've come to defile the toy box!
[283:07.36]Kill them!
[283:08.48]No, wait, brother.
[283:10.10]Look!
[283:11.20]It is the dog and rabbit!
[283:14.16]Justice prophesied on Tablet 8, verse 32.
[283:17.54]Uh, excuse me.
[283:19.69]I'm pretty sure you mean Tablet 6, verse 24.
[283:22.23]Parrot!
[283:25.03]Looks like another in a long line of wacky cults, Max.
[283:28.69]We're in so many prophecies, we should start charging royalties.
[283:31.91]You try and entertain the other wingnuts while I find a way to power this thing up.
[283:35.54]Power this thing up.
[283:39.26]So, the moles are an ancient group of old beings whom...
[283:54.82]That's the most evil-looking toy chest I've ever seen.
[283:57.65]Big gorilla.
[283:58.03]No doubt it'd unleash all kinds of horrors if we ever opened it.
[284:01.47]I'll get a crowbar!
[284:03.03]And I'll scrounge up some blasting calves.
[284:05.09]No!
[284:05.59]You mustn't open it!
[284:07.25]That would give General Skunkope unimaginable power to destroy us all.
[284:13.13]They're right, pal.
[284:14.33]We'd better get rid of Skunk Ape first.
[284:18.25]Alright, we'll plug it in.
[284:19.67]Cable.
[284:20.71]The workers left some of the cable exposed when they were busy not fixing the power in this dump.
[284:24.56]Stick it right in here, right?
[284:27.02]Yeah, let's go.
[284:30.90]Wait, what?
[284:35.70]Plug the power cable into the boiler?
[284:44.08]There's no place on the toy box to plug this in.
[284:51.52]I can't plug a rift generator into that.
[284:53.60]Why?
[284:57.83]Is that just like a jokey outlet over here?
[285:01.39]Does it go in the outlet?
[285:06.81]Well, it's plugged in, but there's not enough power to turn it on.
[285:11.99]Okay.
[285:14.19]Boiler controls.
[285:16.63]Ah!
[285:16.91]Turn that off!
[285:18.85]You're killing us here!
[285:21.52]At least the boiler still works.
[285:24.88]Uh... Alright.
[285:27.86]So, should I melt them?
[285:32.72]What's with the creepy toy box?
[285:34.90]It is everything and nothing.
[285:37.32]The power infinite.
[285:39.72]Oh, well that makes sense.
[285:41.45]We have guarded and worshipped it from behind the shadowy veil of faith for generations.
[285:47.01]We love the box so much, we've prepared a song about it.
[285:51.15]We love the toy box, cause it's really great.
[286:00.73]Man, the musical numbers have really gone downhill since we've been on break.
[286:04.39]Some of us had grown to believe it was just an allegory.
[286:07.92]I'm looking at you, Jebediah.
[286:11.22]But the veil has been lifted.
[286:13.08]There it is, before us, just as the tablets foretold.
[286:19.41]What's inside that toy box anyway?
[286:21.71]No one knows.
[286:22.85]No one has seen it for thousands of years.
[286:25.67]There are those who believe it contains toys.
[286:30.96]Oh right, like the creator of all things is really some fanciful box in the sky filled with magical toys!
[286:37.21]You'll have to excuse Obadiah, he's a fundamentalist.
[286:42.29]Before it sounded like you were expecting to see Max and me.
[286:45.33]Yes, you're coming with Foretold in the sacred tablets and scrolls.
[286:49.69]And yay, the devil bunny, knowing not his true purpose, would unlock the mysteries of the toy box.
[286:57.39]Hey, Sam, it likes me.
[287:00.15]You know what that means, Obadiah.
[287:02.39]It's time for the apocalypse!
[287:08.25]What's that toy box got to do with Max?
[287:10.78]Yeah Suck on that pretzel, chat
[287:33.92]It's nice to be proven right.
[287:35.92]Who are you guys?
[287:37.23]We are the Boxists, the last keepers of the true way.
[287:41.65]While our brothers have succumbed to the siren song of secular America with its basalt-rich tunnels and specialty coffees, only we remain to act as guardians of the Box.
[287:55.19]Is there anything in your scriptures about how we can defeat Skunk Ape?
[287:58.93]Just that the box will show you the way.
[288:02.21]And then the devil bunny and his chubby sidekick broke down the wall and slew the betrayer of mole men.
[288:13.81]You guys stay crazy.
[288:15.29]There's like an antimatter explosive, right?
[288:20.22]Should we like take down the wall?
[288:24.97]Of some sort?
[288:36.99]Let's see what this does.
[288:42.69]Give up, skunk ape.
[288:43.73]You're under arrest.
[288:45.07]So he's arrested under here.
[288:47.87]Well, it's worth a shot.
[288:49.25]Hey, Max, want to come here and ground me?
[288:57.95]Yes, okay.
[289:04.17]Can I get them to be teleported into the... the... the incineration room thing?
[289:13.46]Do I just have to keep doing that until they get annoyed and leave?
[289:17.30]Let's see what happens if I do it, like, three or four more times.
[289:25.25]What is wrong with you?
[289:27.27]Oops, sorry.
[289:37.61]I'd better keep this.
[289:38.86]It could be an important clue in our case.
[289:40.18]I can't, like, catch that in, like, the sweat or something?
[289:50.66]I'd better keep this.
[289:58.73]Well, at least the boiler still works.
[290:04.41]What about the plug?
[290:05.59]Can I put the plug down?
[290:06.79]Is this gonna short out everything?
[290:09.53]I can't just put it on the ground.
[290:21.38]I can't really move around.
[290:24.22]Try to plug this power into that power.
[290:28.74]I would try to just lay it on the ground.
[290:31.28]Well, it's worth a shot.
[290:32.72]Hey, Max, want to come here and ground me?
[290:35.24]You're pushing 40 in dog years, you're not a very good detective, and it looks like you've put on weight.
[290:39.55]Thanks, that should do it.
[290:40.29]How does it go?
[290:40.67]That did not look like an answer.
[290:43.65]Oh, I should be able to turn on that Rift Transmogrifier, or whatever.
[290:47.99]There's got to be something in this city with the unholy power we need to power up this invention.
[290:53.10]What's the point of having him be like... What's it for?
[290:58.49]So, let's teleport.
[291:00.13]Back to the ship.
[291:28.74]Get it on him.
[291:32.64]He doesn't have the goggles anymore, so how would he know?
[291:35.46]Did you see that, my queen?
[291:38.00]Not only did I defeat Sam and Max, but I took care of the penal zone in one stroke.
[291:46.32]Unfortunate word choice.
[291:52.27]Sam and Max, you survived!
[291:54.33]Have you returned with a... How do I put this tactfully?
[291:57.61]Better thought-out plan to stop Skunkafe?
[292:00.80]Our last plan would've worked fine if he hadn't changed the future.
[292:04.40]Yeah!
[292:04.60]How do I put this tactfully?
[292:07.28]Hmm, bite me.
[292:09.00]You'll need to get your personal belongings.
[292:11.20]Let me see if I can... Oh, that hurts!
[292:15.36]Does everyone else taste butterscotch?
[292:19.05]Thanks, Brain.
[292:20.03]Now we just need a way to get this homing beacon on Skunk Ape's back without his noticing.
[292:23.72]I can't remember the name of my elementary school.
[292:25.98]Are you okay, Brain?
[292:30.12]You're looking a little green.
[292:31.62]Even for you.
[292:32.74]The stress of powering the higher functions of this ship is proving most detergent.
[292:38.02]Plus, I think this broth is starting to go bad.
[292:42.71]Broth doesn't go bad.
[292:43.95]How are we supposed to stop Skunk Ape now?
[292:45.83]I don't know.
[292:47.37]Something about a homing beacon, wasn't it?
[292:49.37]Like thyme and oregano and stuff.
[292:51.70]Keep it together, brain.
[292:58.86]Okay, bye now, Grandma.
[293:13.87]What?
[293:16.39]There's got to be something in this city with the unholy power we need to power up this invention.
[293:20.79]Can you do that again?
[293:22.17]Please do that again.
[293:26.11]Pull power to right mandible.
[293:28.75]Yes.
[293:30.24]I want to hear that again, because that was the same exact noise as Colossus from the X-Men Arcade Cabinet Camp.
[293:37.09]When you do Colossus' super move.
[293:41.09]He does that.
[293:41.71]He goes like... It sounds insane.
[293:48.62]You know when you just hear something and you just... It sticks in your brain forever?
[293:55.36]die earthlings die no no no no where's the silly putty I need the the transformer to any object putty
[294:10.14]You'll live to regret betraying us, Queen Stinky!
[294:13.80]Soon you'll be serving time instead of serving bad food!
[294:17.88]In the penal zone!
[294:20.08]You're no match for General Skunkope, Sam and Max.
[294:23.32]When he's done, the world will never have to listen to your idiotic nonsense ever again.
[294:28.50]Nice performance, Stinky.
[294:30.32]I think Skunk Ape believed it.
[294:32.87]Oh, right.
[294:33.35]Performance.
[294:35.13]There's got to be something in this city with the unholy power we need to power up this invention.
[294:40.29]What?
[294:43.25]No, no, no, put this away.
[294:48.93]What?
[294:49.77]Don't you have planets to blow up or something?
[294:52.01]Thanks, Stinky.
[294:56.66]Hey Brain, can you give us a hand here?
[294:59.37]Maybe cause a subtle yet stylish distraction?
[295:02.73]I grow weak jammin' tracks.
[295:04.71]Oh fuck, I'm gonna crash the game if I do that.
[295:06.41]And I fear my time in this wharf is drawn to a clone.
[295:10.50]But if I can prevent but one villain from massaging another appointment book, my sacrifice is but a small, small bacon melt to pay.
[295:23.24]Great.
[295:23.62]Could you hurry it up?
[295:24.82]Max, show some respect for this noble creature's sacrifice.
[295:27.98]Could you hurry it up, please?
[295:29.59]Donut button, Sam and Max.
[295:31.71]Donut button till we meet again in the plaid.
[295:36.89]Emergency.
[295:38.00]Engine failure.
[295:39.40]Emergency.
[295:42.12]No!
[295:43.10]Not in my moment of triumph!
[295:45.90]Sam and Max must somehow be responsible for this.
[295:49.20]I must find them and destroy them!
[295:54.75]Fill it up, bud.
[295:57.09]Alright, I'll... That's it, little buddy.
[295:58.39]Let's go.
[295:59.59]Take that!
[296:01.58]Wee-hee-hee!
[296:02.42]Go, go, go!
[296:23.01]Step on the button.
[296:28.56]Suck him out.
[296:30.04]Let's win.
[296:37.06]New rift.
[296:45.73]There it is.
[296:49.13]Now...
[296:53.05]Press on the button.
[297:00.28]Well played, Sam and Max.
[297:03.06]But once again, I am too strong, and you have only seconds before... Wait, it can't be...
[297:12.34]The Devil's Toy Box?
[297:15.32]Devil's Toy Box?
[297:17.59]That's right, Jack.
[297:18.61]And it's ours.
[297:19.35]Yeah, go find your own toys.
[297:23.51]Perfect.
[297:24.67]You have led me right to the greatest prize of all.
[297:28.60]Soon your bothersome dimensional rift will close.
[297:33.55]Okay.
[297:34.89]End of that episode.
[297:36.31]Then the next episode, they replay this scene, and you see what happens.
[297:40.18]So I can... Hold on.
[297:42.34]Click this link.
[297:55.39]There it is.
[297:55.85]How did you find this?
[298:05.89]why is there a Twitter there's a Twitter called colossus roar and was it just he just roars at people no this move was so awesome but you could run out of it so quickly when I was like
[298:32.18]When I was like 13, I remember mashing, mashing the special button over and over again, even with default enemies.
[298:38.98]And I spent like $20 in one session, I think at one point.
[298:44.35]I used all of my allowance money.
[298:46.11]I saved up.
[298:47.51]And I didn't even get to like the third boss or something.
[298:55.07]That's burned in my brain from childhood.
[298:58.65]Just... Then you'd be completely out of mana.
[299:05.01]Change your sub sound to that.
[299:10.76]No.
[299:11.18]That would be so annoying.
[299:13.42]Okay, so next episode.
[299:14.94]We're back.
[299:17.65]I will take the toy box and the one who can control it.
[299:23.05]Yes.
[299:25.61]Okay.
[299:25.71]Um... Let's keep up.
[299:41.06]Under arrest by an Earth dog and his pitiful inventions?
[299:48.30]I have more strength in one hand than in all the inventions of your planet's greatest scientists.
[300:04.20]As soon as this case is over, I'm getting a gun with more gorilla stopping power.
[300:09.44]It can't be that easy.
[300:13.10]Uh, turn up the heat.
[300:14.38]Turn up the heat.
[300:17.36]It's going to be too hot in here.
[300:19.26]Turn it off.
[300:20.70]I mean, ouch.
[300:21.84]We live in cool, dark places.
[300:29.31]Whee!
[300:31.53]Can you take, like, one step to your, to your?
[300:36.19]I'd better keep this.
[300:36.99]Do it again.
[300:40.05]It's hard to believe that good old Steamy has been sporadically keeping our building warm for almost a century.
[300:45.25]It's even harder to... Oh, it's there.
[300:46.37]Okay, that's good.
[300:48.03]How do I get him to move?
[300:49.53]He's gonna slip on this, right?
[300:52.04]Just stop fighting so we can hurry this thing up already.
[300:54.86]I got places to be.
[300:56.48]Give up now?
[300:58.16]When I'm so close to having all of the toys?
[301:02.24]Nonsense.
[301:14.51]I'd better keep this.
[301:21.17]Pretty sloppy on you to miss this toy, Skunk Ape.
[301:23.89]It's the best one yet.
[301:25.44]Nonsense.
[301:26.46]It's worthless.
[301:28.16]Are you kidding me?
[301:29.24]It's just dripping with psychic power.
[301:31.56]Right, Max?
[301:32.02]Huh?
[301:34.80]Oh, right.
[301:35.42]That one gives me the power to automatically calculate the proper tip at restaurants.
[301:41.73]Nice one, bonehead.
[301:43.07]It's a very practical power, Sam.
[301:45.33]They can't all be showstoppers.
[301:47.20]Give it to me.
[301:48.62]Now!
[301:49.86]Keep away from the big monkey.
[301:51.24]No fair!
[301:53.66]Give it!
[301:59.85]Save the cards!
[302:08.15]And so our heroes save the world once again.
[302:11.65]Our villain, undone by his own greed.
[302:15.41]It would seem a fitting conclusion.
[302:18.42]But this is not the end.
[302:20.24]Oh no, but merely a beginning.
[302:22.72]The overture, if you will, of a five-part symphony of mayhem that will blow your ever-loving mind.
[302:31.41]What is this mysterious toy box with its bizarre connection to Max?
[302:36.88]Is General Skunkarpe truly defeated?
[302:39.84]Will Sam ever find true love?
[302:42.81]Will Max be able to control his emerging powers?
[302:46.51]Or are his ominous visions of the future a sign of tragedy to come?
[302:52.46]I'll see you in the coming chapters to answer all of these questions, and more.
[302:57.73]But for now, I leave you with this chilling conclusion.
[303:04.57]Ouch!
[303:05.27]Sucked right through three floors in a septic tank!
[303:08.49]There goes our security deposit!
[303:10.60]I wonder if our building is zoned to act as an interdimensional prison.
[303:14.68]Sam?
[303:15.44]What are they looking at?
[303:21.88]Holy heaping helpings of Herodotus on base with martial stacks and a wah-wah pedal.
[303:27.88]Is that us?
[303:38.30]Oh, shit.
[303:40.20]Imagine if that's the only thing I've said this whole entire time.
[303:59.81]There's up to one There we go nice that's nice that's tuned down a little Pretty cool
[304:27.63]What a jump in quality!
[304:29.71]Yeah, I mean, well, graphics.
[304:32.89]And, uh, length-wise, definitely.
[304:35.97]I need to do my fast food tier?
[304:45.78]Oh, right.
[304:46.30]Um... Hold on, give me a minute.
[304:48.44]Do tier lists.
[304:59.24]That was fun.
[305:01.18]That was, um, a little different than the other ones.
[305:12.33]They tugged my graphics up.
[305:17.37]Do a US States tier list.
[305:20.57]What?
[305:23.89]Like places that I've been?
[305:35.20]Season 3 followed a more cohesive story than the last two.
[305:38.20]No, I've never played it.
[305:42.40]This is my first time ever playing these games.
[305:48.45]After credits scene, let's see.
[305:55.69]Wow, come on.
[305:59.85]I waited.
[306:00.23]I waited.
[306:02.35]I waited.
[306:05.17]Well, there was episode one.
[306:06.39]Episode two will be on a different day.
[306:09.81]Because if the episodes are, I mean, obviously like 40 minutes of that was from the bullshit we did with chat and all the weird stuff we were doing earlier.
[306:20.97]If they're like three to four hours each or four hours, four and a half hours, something like that, then I probably do this on a different day.
[306:33.90]Because I know we're going to be in there for another four to five plus hours.
[306:39.22]I'm not end of the stream voicing.
[306:41.18]What are you talking about?
[306:43.99]Why does stopping after episode one mean the stream turns off?
[306:48.97]What?
[306:51.69]I'm going to go pee.
[306:53.09]I'm going to grab a water.
[306:53.97]I'm going to come back and hang out and do tier lists.
[306:57.07]And something else.
[307:00.52]I'm not leaving.
[307:00.94]What are you talking about?
[307:03.26]I'll be right back.
[307:07.08]That didn't even cover anything.
[307:12.50]Oh, yes it did.
[307:20.13]I'll be right back.
[307:21.85]Don't go nowhere.
[307:22.83]Unless you have to go somewhere.
[307:24.01]Then, hope we have a good time wherever you go.
