[00:01.33]You laugh, you lose.
[00:02.69]You laugh, you fucking lose.
[00:04.03]You laugh, you lose.
[00:05.45]You laugh, you fucking lose.
[00:07.62]You laugh, you lose.
[00:09.04]You laugh, you fucking lose.
[00:10.14]Hey, what's up?
[00:14.12]You're really late?
[00:14.72]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16.48]I'll talk about it.
[00:17.10]I'll explain what's going on here.
[00:26.27]Let me make a tweet.
[00:27.01]Give me one sec.
[00:51.67]Okay.
[00:52.31]You laugh, you lose.
[00:53.68]You laugh, you fucking lose.
[00:55.14]You laugh, you lose.
[00:56.54]You laugh, you fucking lose.
[00:59.06]Sorry, there's something wrong with me.
[01:00.58]Hi!
[01:03.79]So you're probably looking for Monster Rancher 2.
[01:06.77]Sorry that that's not here today.
[01:09.46]I saw that House Flipper had a major update.
[01:13.10]They added a bunch of stuff.
[01:14.02]It's been a while.
[01:15.84]It's been a year, I think, since I played it.
[01:18.94]And as you all know, if you've been a watcher of the stream for a long time, a House Flipper DLC automatically turns the stream on.
[01:27.55]So that's just what's going to happen.
[01:32.78]But we can play it.
[01:34.44]It's called Luxury DLC.
[01:37.06]I guess it's huge houses.
[01:38.38]I don't know how long this is going to take me, but it's advertised to be some of the biggest houses they've ever put in the game.
[01:47.16]I don't know.
[01:49.38]He hates Monster Rancher.
[01:50.52]What's your opinion on Alaska's beautiful landscape?
[01:53.64]Oh.
[01:54.64]Mwah.
[01:58.58]VOD watchers, skip.
[01:59.84]Don't skip any of my content.
[02:02.08]Ever.
[02:05.25]Unless you're busy and you got something to do.
[02:09.85]Let me turn my fan on back here.
[02:13.00]By the way, I went through the VOD.
[02:14.26]Some of the clips and timestamps.
[02:18.44]When I saw people randomly writing about my sweaty armpits.
[02:23.72]I was like, why are they saying that?
[02:26.34]That was some of the worst I've ever seen.
[02:28.12]Somebody threw water at me.
[02:36.75]What did you say?
[02:37.67]You laugh, you lose.
[02:39.01]Chat was toxic.
[02:42.37]Humor is so subjective.
[02:43.91]I'm surprised that even five of you are here.
[02:48.76]It's one of those things where people just don't think certain things are funny.
[02:52.12]They think certain things are annoying or stupid.
[02:54.66]Some people think things are dumb.
[02:57.92]Some people think those dumb things are funny.
[02:59.60]Some people think the funny thing is childish.
[03:05.67]VOD watchers, skip everything.
[03:08.11]You wouldn't open up a VOD if you were going to skip everything.
[03:12.25]What you should say is, VOD watchers... I'm not going to say that because people will do it as a joke.
[03:18.40]Alright, let's talk about... We're going to do a content update here.
[03:21.66]It's content update part of the stream.
[03:24.76]First of all, can you even say hi?
[03:29.81]I invited you over for dinner.
[03:31.53]And you... You pushed the door open.
[03:33.69]You did a little light knock.
[03:35.06]I opened the door.
[03:35.66]The door pushes with your hand.
[03:37.76]Where's Monster Rancher?
[03:40.60]How about, like, how are my two kids?
[03:45.64]Yeah, you know.
[03:47.96]Jason and Darcy.
[03:48.64]You're not gonna talk about my twins?
[03:53.08]You know, they're... They're six.
[03:55.14]So... Whatever.
[04:00.10]Fuck Monster Rancher.
[04:01.08]How could you say something like that?
[04:02.14]It's one of the best games ever made.
[04:09.10]You have two kids?
[04:10.56]I thought that that was common knowledge.
[04:11.76]This is surprising to a lot of you somehow.
[04:19.06]Interesting.
[04:20.26]Okay, so let's do a content update.
[04:22.00]You haven't been paying attention?
[04:27.08]How do you... You don't think... What?
[04:30.38]How do you not know this?
[04:34.28]Alright, so.
[04:35.70]Content update.
[04:37.44]I got some stuff to talk to you about.
[04:39.28]Today, we're going to play House Flipper DLC, Luxury DLC.
[04:42.01]I'm in a weird mood today.
[04:44.97]It's a full moon.
[04:45.53]It's one of those big orange moons.
[04:47.63]So we're going to play that.
[04:51.65]In a couple of days, I'm going to do a Christmas Eve stream.
[04:56.47]That's right.
[04:58.16]The first time in a long time, I will be live on Christmas Eve.
[05:02.86]And that stream is going to be a compilation of Itch.io games.
[05:08.99]Gonna get a bunch of them.
[05:10.57]If you have any of your favorites, stuff that you've never played, because I've never done that before.
[05:15.15]We're talking the weird, creepy, scary ones to the funny ones, the weird ones.
[05:20.76]I'm gonna put together a little compilation and play them.
[05:24.20]So if you have recommendations, put them in the recommended channel because I'm going to go through that and I'm going to just get a bunch of them.
[05:31.94]But make sure the same rules apply to that recommended channel.
[05:34.70]Don't just go in there and just put bullshit in it.
[05:39.42]That's Christmas Eve.
[05:42.06]A few days later, after the holidays, on the 27th, I hope you're writing these down.
[05:48.46]We're going to play Oregon Trader Space
[05:53.36]Stocks game.
[05:55.44]It's got a long title.
[05:56.96]I'm gonna play the or- That's been recommended so many times, people just want me to play it so bad.
[06:00.92]It's a game where you trade alien organs.
[06:04.54]And it's like a stock market simulator.
[06:07.96]People said, I- I've got like 30 recommendations about it.
[06:13.06]And they're like, you need to fucking play this game, Jeremy, please.
[06:16.44]So we're gonna do that on the 27th.
[06:21.02]And then, on the 31st, I'm still hopeful-
[06:24.36]There will be the New Year's Eve stream with the awards.
[06:27.44]And the Rumble.
[06:30.60]Pretty cool.
[06:31.38]Sounds fun.
[06:32.74]You will have that poll to be able to start voting.
[06:35.66]The nominees this year, there were so many.
[06:38.88]It's a process to narrow this all down.
[06:43.57]So once we do that, and that's done with, on Christmas Eve, I am hoping that after my stream...
[06:51.61]I will be able to tweet out or talk about on Christmas Eve.
[06:55.35]Go vote, because the poll is ready.
[06:57.49]And then obviously on New Year's we'll do the Rumble.
[07:01.11]And then... We're going back to VR.
[07:08.19]The first couple weeks of January.
[07:10.97]Maybe the second or third week of January.
[07:12.70]Somewhere in there.
[07:13.28]I'm going to set the whole VR setup again.
[07:16.04]And we're going to do a couple weeks of VR.
[07:17.98]Missed a lot of stuff.
[07:19.58]I know, don't get concerned.
[07:20.72]I know a lot of people just went, oh, but what about... I'm going to be fine.
[07:24.98]I'm going to do some seated VR.
[07:27.37]Some standing VR sprinkled in.
[07:31.71]I promise I won't puke.
[07:35.45]And then... I don't have a hard date for you, but I want you all to be aware of it.
[07:41.30]There's a big stream coming at the end of January.
[07:45.48]That last week of January, keep your eyes peeled for me to announce a hard date.
[07:52.14]It is not baseball, by the way.
[07:55.02]And then, baseball is going to be probably somewhere in March.
[08:01.21]But there is a big stream that I've not talked about that's at that same level.
[08:07.41]It's going to be the end of January.
[08:12.21]I can't wait.
[08:13.57]Getting any hints.
[08:14.73]I can't fucking wait for that stream.
[08:18.04]So there's your content plan for the next month or two.
[08:29.72]And sprinkled in there, sprinkled in there will be a few more announcements.
[08:33.76]Sprinkled in there.
[08:42.86]Still owe us a Catboy stream.
[08:44.70]Are you more concerned about the Catboy costume not being put on or more concerned about like the 1.7 billion dollars I still owe you?
[08:57.94]You gotta pick priorities here.
[08:59.09]Alright, let's play House Flipper.
[09:03.34]Yeah, I just wanted to give a kind of an update on how things are going to go.
[09:05.42]I'm very excited, especially for this stream in January.
[09:08.93]I think it's going to be fucking hilarious.
[09:10.47]I hope it is.
[09:11.57]It sounds like it could be fun.
[09:16.69]I think it's going to be funny.
[09:19.21]We'll see, though, because it's not for me to decide.
[09:21.69]Yeah, I might think that, but that's for you to decide.
[09:25.45]So, well, I hope that ends up being the case.
[09:28.37]Alright, let's go.
[09:29.37]House Flipper, the DLC is here.
[09:34.72]Make a debt payment program.
[09:36.31]There you go.
[09:42.67]So, if you have never played House Flipper, go get it right now.
[09:48.01]I had to kind of redo some stuff.
[09:49.81]You notice I have half a million dollars.
[09:52.51]That's because I cheated.
[09:53.33]Because I haven't opened this game in a year.
[09:57.76]And to do a lot of the luxury stuff, I think you need a lot of money.
[10:00.00]And I'm also missing a tool.
[10:02.28]I don't know what it is.
[10:04.74]So I know you'd like to make this DLC fun.
[10:07.52]I believe you need to have some money.
[10:11.96]We did this one, but I don't have this saved.
[10:17.87]You can't even hear anything.
[10:18.97]There we go.
[10:23.23]You sound weird today.
[10:24.21]Okay.
[10:29.29]Okay.
[10:30.02]Alright, luxury flipper.
[10:31.18]Here we go.
[10:31.68]So apparently how this works is we have to do like jobs for luxury clients.
[10:35.70]Kind of looks like The Sims.
[10:41.37]And then I think, I don't know, I think we can buy real estate out here.
[10:45.47]You sound fucked up.
[10:48.27]I was... Listen.
[10:50.51]Listen.
[10:53.08]Wiggle your treble and your bass on your computer.
[10:55.83]When's the last time you did that?
[10:57.29]Why does everybody blame me for me sounding weird?
[11:00.35]Have you ever changed the dial and the bass on your equalizer?
[11:05.71]You might be like negative 8 bass right now and be like, everything sounds like shit.
[11:10.13]How come the whole world sounds like shit?
[11:11.47]Alright, so this is the first client.
[11:17.98]You sound the same.
[11:18.64]I know, I'm just giving that person shit.
[11:24.78]Change the bass on your vocal cords?
[11:26.30]Okay.
[11:29.64]Let me... You know what I've never tried?
[11:31.50]Let me see how low I can actually get without making like a funny joke voice.
[11:36.32]Hey.
[11:38.28]Hey.
[11:38.84]Hey.
[11:39.80]Hey.
[11:41.30]Hey.
[11:43.14]Hey.
[11:44.68]Hey, everybody.
[11:46.36]How are you?
[11:46.86]Hey, everybody.
[11:47.34]How are you doing?
[11:48.48]I'm doing really good.
[11:49.34]How are you?
[11:52.88]That's not... I mean, that's kind of weird sounding.
[11:55.96]It kind of got jokey there at the end, yeah.
[12:00.50]How do you do a low voice without being jokey?
[12:07.06]It's impossible.
[12:08.58]Okay, I'm on a boat.
[12:09.70]Jimmy took advantage of his father's absence and threw a huge party on the family's yacht.
[12:14.88]He had a great time with his friends, which can be proved by the equally great mess they left behind.
[12:20.10]Now the young social butterfly needs someone willing to clean it up before his father's return.
[12:24.33]Fortunately, a world tour he's currently on will go for another week or so.
[12:28.97]What, if they clean somebody's boat? ...
[12:38.59]Okay.
[12:40.49]These freak me out, by the way.
[12:41.73]I would never want to live on something like this.
[12:44.83]See the windows down there?
[12:45.77]Don't you feel like if your PC was down there and you're just playing Fortnite and all of a sudden... What if water got in?
[12:51.25]Behold!
[12:52.74]My yacht!
[12:53.72]It's voice acting.
[12:54.54]Technically my father's, but let's be honest.
[12:57.80]It's almost mine at this point.
[13:00.72]Last night I invited some friends over.
[13:03.26]I feel like you would open up the fucking window and a big wave would crash.
[13:07.22]And hit the window, go in the window and like fry your computer.
[13:10.42]And like electrocute you.
[13:11.48]Why is this voice acting?
[13:14.60]Have I timed?
[13:28.19]How much time do I have?
[13:29.61]Oh, Pete's on the bed.
[13:31.17]Oh, you must be 20.
[13:32.77]Pete's on the bed.
[13:33.49]Why would anyone ever do that?
[13:34.85]I have kind of a messy desk, and even back when I was like 18, 19, 20, 21...
[13:56.45]I had a kind of a messy room, but I would never put a cooked pizza out of the box in my bed.
[14:06.42]Who would do something like that?
[14:10.97]Alright, dude, you got to do this.
[14:12.79]I have a thousand dollars.
[14:13.81]It's like a new area.
[14:20.44]Oh, I thought I could drive around.
[14:21.70]Okay.
[14:24.44]I have to clean this boat.
[14:26.82]By the way, I have, like, the Santa pack.
[14:29.55]It was free.
[14:30.65]I think.
[14:31.39]I don't know if that's accurate.
[14:32.53]Alright, I have to clean the boat?
[14:35.97]What's the damage?
[14:36.51]Okay, a bunch of takeout containers.
[14:42.44]A bunch of baby trays, like, to separate baby food.
[14:49.36]These are all fine.
[14:52.15]bed between two pizzas is a calzone nobody does this and if you do no no nobody has a party like this if I went to a party and it looked like wait you can now change the stairs in some houses what do you mean wrong would you sit at this fucking table
[15:19.86]There's bird shit all over here somehow.
[15:22.16]I don't even know how.
[15:23.98]I'm not going to sit at this table.
[15:25.36]Okay, maybe I would come to this party, but I would be standing.
[15:33.08]And I'm going to wear those little booties that the Comcast guy puts on his shoes before he comes in your house.
[15:39.52]I'm literally going to wear those.
[15:40.50]Alright, let's clean it up.
[15:52.28]this down I love how it's Santa too calm cast guy alright looks fine can I get the stain alright I got the stain this is probably gonna take like 10 minutes not even I love this game
[16:21.92]I want to talk to, like, a psychologist.
[16:25.76]Because there has to be a reason.
[16:29.31]There has to be.
[16:30.59]I don't like doing this shit in real life.
[16:32.83]I hate it.
[16:35.59]Why do I think this is cool doing this in this pretend world that doesn't matter?
[16:38.85]Thousand dollar budget.
[16:51.01]Is anybody in chat kind of a psychologist?
[16:56.04]Let's get, okay, all trash first.
[17:01.78]Is this closed?
[17:05.30]It's a good stream idea.
[17:09.83]No, I... I don't know.
[17:12.91]Ooh.
[17:15.71]Ooh.
[17:19.88]Psychologist here.
[17:20.80]It's because I've missed it.
[17:22.08]The chat went too fast.
[17:24.02]You could have just, like, maybe internalized a lot of things, but oh well.
[17:32.78]It would just be real life.
[17:37.28]Those cans.
[17:39.36]I love it.
[17:39.70]It's so relaxing.
[17:41.68]Is this broken?
[17:42.35]Alright, this shit's broken.
[17:43.99]Alright, sell the electric cooker.
[17:50.28]Oh, I have to sell this too?
[17:51.38]Oh, they want a glass mini fridge.
[17:55.93]Oh, okay.
[17:57.97]What about the plates?
[17:58.55]Get these out of here.
[18:05.11]Sell the boat.
[18:12.28]How did- Okay.
[18:15.12]Can you do an open house on a boat?
[18:19.91]Do they do that?
[18:20.51]I feel like that would be so interesting.
[18:32.92]Oh, it's a boat.
[18:33.76]But, you know what I mean, though.
[18:40.00]I would just go to the boat open house because I've never really been on a boat before.
[18:45.17]Well, hold on.
[18:45.79]That's not true.
[18:46.61]I've been on a boat before.
[18:47.61]I've been on... Okay.
[18:49.79]Does, like, the Boston Harbor Cruise thing count?
[18:58.32]Does that count?
[19:01.44]Like, the tourist thing where you go do the harbor cruise?
[19:04.92]I guess it's like a 30-40 minute thing.
[19:08.37]That thing's huge, though.
[19:09.17]It's not like this.
[19:09.87]Can I die?
[19:18.87]Alright, this is almost done.
[19:21.93]Alex, wait.
[19:22.53]Get that dirt off that seat.
[19:27.50]Did you partake in the Boston Tea Party?
[19:31.28]I don't know.
[19:32.50]Dude, no, but, like, our collective, like, probably fucking... How many people here?
[19:38.29]13,000 people right now?
[19:42.24]I bet you, like, if we mushed up, like, 5,000 of our DNA, it probably was, like, our great-great-great-uncle or something.
[19:57.37]Can I sleep on this?
[19:58.15]Wait, use?
[20:03.04]Oh, this is kind of nice.
[20:08.12]You don't need a psychologist to realize that you are zonked.
[20:17.15]I'm not going to go to a psychologist and ask the psychologist if I'm high.
[20:21.57]What a waste of time.
[20:22.43]Alright, that looks good.
[20:29.46]There's some piece of dirt right here, whatever it is.
[20:30.90]Whoa, you can open this?
[20:35.80]See, I don't want windows.
[20:37.03]No, I don't like this.
[20:39.33]If there's a high wave or something, it's gonna just crash in and ruin your fucking Mario Party session you're having.
[20:47.75]I don't think I'd want to do that.
[20:51.13]Is it weird that I would want my whole boat to have no windows?
[20:54.93]Just whatever, like wood or concrete or something.
[20:58.47]I wouldn't want any windows.
[21:05.45]Do you want a submarine?
[21:06.53]I think a submarine would be better.
[21:10.31]I want the whole thing enclosed.
[21:12.59]I want an enclosed space.
[21:18.59]Look at all this shit.
[21:19.23]Did they eat up here for like three months?
[21:23.86]I feel like they were shitting in these bags.
[21:34.58]Submarine Andy.
[21:37.63]Okay, I will... This is cool.
[21:40.27]Right?
[21:40.63]This is cool.
[21:43.17]But it's like the only cool thing I think about when I think about a boat.
[21:48.47]I like the water.
[21:49.41]They're not paying me to redecorate.
[21:56.23]Alright.
[21:59.51]That's good.
[22:02.37]You're a fucking landlubber.
[22:06.35]Wait.
[22:11.07]What did you say?
[22:15.99]Say that again.
[22:18.05]You're a land lover.
[22:23.34]Somebody said land lover.
[22:26.14]Why is it called land lover?
[22:35.97]Is that because it's land lover?
[22:40.68]Is it actually what that is?
[22:41.78]Because sailors... Wait, what?
[22:49.63]What did I think it was?
[22:50.49]I don't... Land lover.
[22:55.31]What was it?
[22:56.09]I don't know.
[22:56.55]I didn't think it was land lover.
[23:00.47]I thought it meant like dweller.
[23:02.33]Like land dweller.
[23:03.51]Like lubber.
[23:04.31]Oh no.
[23:05.59]What have they done to my father's anchor?
[23:10.21]My friends must have played with it at the party, and now it's ruined.
[23:13.69]Is this me?
[23:14.37]Wait, I have to renovate this thing?
[23:20.23]You have some tools for that, right?
[23:23.05]No, you gotta bring this, like, a clogsmith.
[23:25.15]I can't do this.
[23:27.19]What?
[23:28.39]Choose a segment of the furniture to work on.
[23:30.43]The first step of renovation is always cleaning the surface of the furniture.
[23:35.99]Every material requires a specific tool.
[23:38.66]Is this wood?
[23:40.58]Oh, shit.
[23:47.92]Oh, cool.
[23:48.52]I like this.
[23:49.08]Why don't you do it?
[23:49.68]Is dad gonna notice that I have sanded this down to all the way where the stain is gone?
[24:07.22]I'm sure he's going to notice like the four or five centimeters thinner that this just got.
[24:12.42]Hold right mouse button to move the camera.
[24:28.13]I thought these things were made out of steel, not wood.
[24:30.43]Wouldn't this thing just float?
[24:33.51]What good is a wooden anchor?
[24:36.81]Am I crazy?
[24:40.19]What is this made of?
[24:40.91]Is this not made out of wood?
[24:41.87]Oh, this is a decoration.
[24:43.95]Okay.
[24:45.23]I thought this was the anchor.
[24:47.96]I was like, what the fuck are you doing with this?
[24:49.70]It's not going to stop like a 40,000 pound boat.
[24:52.56]Is that it?
[24:58.93]No, here it is.
[25:07.35]Okay, press Q. Ooh.
[25:13.13]Got it.
[25:13.71]What happened to the color?
[25:15.91]Can you fix it?
[25:16.67]Does it imply that he's standing right behind me?
[25:18.99]Make it look, you know, finished?
[25:24.30]Alright.
[25:25.14]What color should I do?
[25:27.98]How about blue?
[25:31.56]Wait.
[25:34.11]Ocean deep.
[25:36.15]No.
[25:37.75]No.
[25:39.65]Ooh.
[25:39.95]One of these.
[25:42.35]Iroko.
[25:44.19]No.
[25:46.01]Titan white.
[25:47.76]No.
[25:51.70]This one.
[26:00.52]This kind of looks like Poseidon's scepter now.
[26:05.82]It's not even an anchor.
[26:06.72]Uh, alright, let's spin it.
[26:16.26]It still works, though.
[26:17.00]It could be whatever.
[26:17.84]It's a baby toy.
[26:25.72]It is a baby toy.
[26:26.87]That looks good.
[26:30.71]Flip it.
[26:33.94]This feels nice, though.
[26:34.92]I can smell this paint.
[26:35.90]You shouldn't be doing that, but you know what I mean?
[26:39.94]That, like, fresh, it just was painted smell.
[26:43.66]Did I miss anything?
[26:45.46]This part.
[26:45.86]What is this?
[26:46.20]Alright, this is, like, the part of the flute, like, the wood piece you put in your mouth.
[26:55.27]Like, it's wicked saliva and, like, soggy and dirty.
[26:57.31]It's one of the reasons why I never played an instrument.
[26:59.51]Especially one of a wood instrument.
[27:00.81]No fucking way.
[27:04.26]These things are grosser than retainers.
[27:06.93]Yuck.
[27:11.21]Okay, so that part's blue.
[27:14.35]What about this kind of blue?
[27:15.51]No.
[27:15.73]I don't know.
[27:17.63]Just ocean blue.
[27:28.76]Blue and brown.
[27:38.70]It's your own saliva.
[27:44.22]Okay.
[27:47.02]Alright, put the renovated furniture wherever it will present itself the best.
[27:56.47]Just put it like right here.
[27:57.25]I mean, is this Satanic if I do it like this?
[28:07.15]Is that bad to do?
[28:08.13]This, like, freaked me out.
[28:18.64]It's just anti-Poseidonic.
[28:26.50]I kind of want it like this.
[28:30.37]No, it sucks over there.
[28:31.55]I have to put it here.
[28:32.21]I want to put it somewhere else.
[28:37.88]Like, on the bar.
[28:38.40]Right in front of the bar.
[28:39.16]Can I go here?
[28:45.80]Stupid.
[28:46.16]Remember, please comment on the bug you swallowed.
[28:49.12]Does it taste better?
[28:54.72]I said that eight years ago!
[28:57.42]I said it eight... I didn't just... It didn't just happen last weekend!
[29:03.53]I don't even remember what you're talking about.
[29:06.35]Stop going back and ratioing old tweets of mine.
[29:09.09]I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.
[29:11.09]You're talking about a tweet from like 2012.
[29:12.33]That looks good there.
[29:26.12]But you remembered.
[29:27.62]No, I didn't.
[29:28.72]The reason why I remembered is because I got ratioed last week from a tweet I made in 2012.
[29:38.07]Okay, now what?
[29:38.63]Oh, we gotta buy the mini fridge.
[29:42.79]Okay, glass mini fridge.
[29:45.40]Let's do this one a, uh... Let's say, uh, black is good.
[29:50.32]Where's the mini fridge go, bro?
[29:51.32]Right here?
[29:52.18]Right, so the captain's quarters?
[29:58.03]Is it weird that every time I just see a mini fridge, all I can think of is Red Bull?
[30:02.67]It's the only thing I can think of.
[30:11.49]Alright, here's an oven.
[30:13.00]Look, I don't care.
[30:13.50]It's not my house.
[30:14.16]Who gives a shit?
[30:18.64]Okay.
[30:19.22]Remove trash.
[30:20.02]Where's the trash?
[30:20.76]Oh.
[30:27.98]This job has to be 100%.
[30:28.64]Alright, when do I get to have my mansion?
[30:38.53]Just try to get like, I just want like seagulls to come in here and shit all over their house.
[30:41.51]Okay.
[30:49.22]Uh, is it up?
[30:49.86]Where is this?
[30:50.56]I can't reach it.
[30:51.06]Okay, got it.
[31:02.27]Oh, it's in your, probably in your dirty bedroom.
[31:06.08]Yeah, bro.
[31:06.86]Come on, man.
[31:07.88]Bro.
[31:09.10]Really?
[31:09.34]Bro.
[31:12.84]What do you got under the bed?
[31:17.38]Come on.
[31:29.46]What's on the bed?
[31:29.96]Do I have to make the bed?
[31:31.70]No.
[31:31.86]Alright, that looks fine.
[31:35.13]Close this up.
[31:40.49]I don't think I've ever met anyone with more plastic bags than you.
[31:47.61]Get a canvas bag.
[31:49.15]It's way easier.
[31:49.97]You can put way more shit in it.
[31:54.03]You get one of those canvas bags that has like the kind of flat bottom.
[31:58.53]Here you go, you guys.
[31:59.11]Here's the tactic.
[31:59.79]Ready for a tip?
[32:02.95]When you go to the grocery store and you get like 12 plastic bags that you have to do like a fucking Olympic sport to take into your house, if you're strong enough to get, you know what I'm saying, like one bag on pinky, one bag on ring finger, one bag on middle finger, one bag on index finger, if you can do that,
[32:23.29]Just get a canvas bag with a flat bottom, you can put all four bags worth of shit in that one bag, and you can just carry that.
[32:32.00]I'm telling you, don't- you start doing that.
[32:33.86]You don't have to do that weird awkward trip anymore where some of the bags are heavier and one of them's too heavy on the pinky and everything.
[32:56.19]Nice painting.
[33:00.62]Wait, this doesn't look right to me.
[33:02.28]I'm rearranging this.
[33:03.00]That's better.
[33:21.65]Make the bed.
[33:22.25]That was easy.
[33:27.38]Watch, watch.
[33:27.72]There's gonna be a Bible in one of these.
[33:28.90]Is it a broken mirror?
[33:32.11]I'm stuck.
[33:37.41]Oh, fuck.
[33:37.93]I'm stuck.
[33:40.25]Alright, whatever.
[33:40.69]Who cares?
[33:41.43]Where's this broken mirror?
[33:43.19]In here?
[33:49.24]What's broken?
[33:50.22]Is this a mirror?
[33:56.34]What is this?
[33:58.83]That's weird.
[33:59.21]I don't like that.
[34:01.56]Where's this broken mirror?
[34:08.12]Sell?
[34:08.48]Oh, sell it, but it's not broken.
[34:15.12]You guys see a... I don't see a broken mirror.
[34:21.83]This is not even a mirror.
[34:22.95]This is like acoustic foam.
[34:24.93]What?
[34:27.81]That doesn't look like a mirror?
[34:32.50]Alright, that one.
[34:32.94]Is this one done?
[34:34.88]Yeah, this one's done.
[34:35.58]How about this one?
[34:37.30]This is done.
[34:37.80]Alright, close that up.
[34:45.00]This is done.
[34:46.28]Other side.
[34:46.68]Is there another staircase?
[34:52.55]There is.
[34:55.19]Do you give Otto forehead kisses?
[34:57.33]Yes.
[34:58.70]Of course I do.
[34:59.68]Whoa.
[34:59.92]What are you eating?
[35:04.22]What is that?
[35:04.66]What was that?
[35:10.12]Little fender.
[35:17.22]I was going to throw this trophy out the window.
[35:31.75]There's the pizza.
[35:34.03]Didn't even eat one slice.
[35:37.68]Not one single slice has been eaten.
[35:48.66]Alright, we gonna get some voice acting here?
[35:49.92]He's gonna be like, Thanks, man!
[35:56.71]I mean, if you got a home gym, you're an automatic asshole.
[35:59.29]I have to say it.
[35:59.91]I'm sorry.
[36:11.11]I'm kidding.
[36:11.81]I'm kidding.
[36:27.17]God.
[36:27.29]Jerma hates healthy people.
[36:43.73]Shits coming with me Do they care what I do with this?
[36:50.72]Let me put this out on the dock so people can watch me work out
[37:07.85]Wasn't that you 10 years ago?
[37:09.21]I didn't have a room in my house that was my exercise room.
[37:12.93]My exercise room was my bedroom, my bedroom was my office, my office was my gaming den, and my gaming den was where I hung out with my friends.
[37:22.98]And where I hung out with my friends, it was all the same room!
[37:34.17]It was very efficient.
[37:41.81]That room fucking stinks, by the way.
[37:44.01]It smells in that room.
[37:46.55]I had to clean it once a week.
[37:49.12]Alright, I need to- okay.
[37:50.00]I gotta stop, like, making stories up, right?
[37:53.28]It's so stupid.
[37:55.06]Why would I want you guys to think that?
[37:56.32]I'm, like, disgusting.
[37:57.34]I don't know.
[37:58.46]Is it some type of weird defense mechanism?
[38:00.56]Where if I tell you I'm gross and weird, then, like, you can't do it?
[38:03.88]You can't say it?
[38:04.56]It has to be.
[38:06.66]Alright, what am I missing?
[38:16.96]Is this dirty?
[38:17.72]Is that part of the art?
[38:19.68]Alright, this is clean.
[38:33.15]So what's left?
[38:33.83]There's nothing left.
[38:34.83]And if it's one bag of Fritos that I'm sorry, you can fuck right off.
[38:44.83]Oh, is this the end of the movie where there is the bag of Doritos on the ground?
[38:49.41]And the door opens, and it's the mom and dad, and it's the car is coming down the road, and they've almost got the whole house clean.
[38:55.72]And right when the door opens, foot slides bag under the couch.
[39:01.34]And they always make a comment of how really clean the house is.
[39:05.98]And they kind of see, they kind of see the kid or whatever slide the foot, and they go, huh.
[39:13.97]I was waiting for one of those movies.
[39:16.29]For them to walk in.
[39:17.63]Be like, huh, whoa, wow.
[39:23.01]What is that?
[39:24.83]Is that lilac?
[39:27.01]We don't have lilac in this house, you motherfucker.
[39:31.64]Where are all the kids?
[39:33.30]You're grounded.
[39:36.52]Wait, Rick and Morty did that?
[39:37.84]Oh, goddammit.
[39:39.40]Where's this last piece?
[39:46.65]Diary of a Wimpy Kid did that?
[39:48.29]Oh, I'm late.
[39:52.30]You're a psycho.
[39:56.22]Or I would... Yeah, no.
[39:57.64]If I knew that that was happening, I would play along.
[40:01.96]I'd walk up to shit, right?
[40:03.63]Yeah, let me turn the cam on for this.
[40:05.71]I would walk up to, like, the windowsill.
[40:10.63]Just kind of be like,
[40:15.37]Like, here's the windowsill.
[40:16.15]I'd be like... You know, I really have to clean this place.
[40:23.66]Ah.
[40:23.74]Where do I?
[40:25.96]Not really.
[40:26.82]I'm not naked.
[40:27.48]I'm right here.
[40:27.89]I would walk around and, like, smell.
[40:33.03]I'd, like... I'd go to, like, the door handle.
[40:35.65]And I'd be like...
[40:37.44]Oh yeah, that is clean!
[40:38.60]I did- I remember cleaning that when I- I remember cleaning that, son.
[40:41.66]Yeah, I did.
[40:42.84]With fresh lemon.
[40:43.58]And I wouldn't talk about it.
[40:45.60]Did I need to vacuum?
[40:51.62]Like, weeks later, I would bring up stuff that I- that I had cleaned in the house.
[40:54.96]Because in those- they do really weird shit in those movies.
[41:02.10]They'll, like, power wash the barrels.
[41:06.21]I haven't done that in a long time.
[41:11.13]Oh, you power washed the fucking barrels.
[41:15.27]Okay.
[41:16.40]I have no idea what this last piece of dirt is.
[41:20.42]Trash barrels?
[41:21.08]The barrels?
[41:21.64]What do you guys call them?
[41:23.20]The trash receptacles?
[41:24.34]What do you call them?
[41:32.96]Where is this piece of dirt?
[41:35.12]The bins, the cans, the barrels.
[41:40.82]I'm sorry, we're from different countries.
[41:42.68]Yes, there are different countries on Earth and we call things different things.
[41:45.73]There's a booger on my hand and I hope you didn't see it.
[41:47.49]I'm serious.
[41:50.43]There's a literal booger on my hand.
[41:54.10]I don't even know how it got there, but it's there, and I- I- it may have been on camera.
[41:57.22]That's why I- I have no idea why- what happened.
[42:00.59]Where?
[42:01.63]Somebody just tell me.
[42:02.33]So- Son?
[42:03.95]Where's that last piece of dirt that you're trying to hide from me?
[42:09.10]It's on the table.
[42:18.57]I'd be like, honey, you know what?
[42:20.63]The house is so clean.
[42:21.73]I remember cleaning this house before we left.
[42:23.57]Let's eat off the floor today.
[42:25.82]Yeah, everyone sit down on the floor.
[42:28.24]Let's eat off the floor, right?
[42:30.02]Right, son?
[42:33.60]Where is it?
[42:34.96]The mini-map will show it.
[42:35.84]Yeah, I'm looking.
[42:36.39]I can't see it.
[42:42.13]dad to like make his point ends up like getting like a fucking bacterial infection from like eating a sandwich off the ground it's the solo cups on the table no it's not dude bro why would you get rid of the solo cups dude change the stairs I'm not buying this for this person no alright let's go
[43:11.91]I did it.
[43:12.19]I got 2,900 bucks.
[43:19.78]Cool.
[43:23.84]I'm not watching the stream right now.
[43:25.58]You... Hold on.
[43:26.76]Do something funny so then somebody can clip it so I can see it.
[43:32.85]Nothing... Yeah, what changed?
[43:35.11]I stole his... The sun went higher during the day.
[43:40.55]That's all that changed.
[43:46.37]This is my house.
[43:50.71]Alright, to be fair, I had to load a new save.
[43:52.94]Morning, a mole has dug its way.
[43:59.92]I don't, whatever.
[44:02.77]Complete each job to unlock new houses for purchase.
[44:05.23]So I can buy the boat now.
[44:18.14]Let me see.
[44:18.80]How much is the boat?
[44:25.72]$563,000!
[44:30.05]What?
[44:32.81]Why would I ever want that?
[44:37.63]I could buy, like, a double cheeseburger at McDonald's for 563 years straight.
[44:43.76]Wait, that's wrong.
[44:46.40]I've said that wrong.
[44:47.79]I could buy a McDouble for McDonald's every single day for 563 hundred years.
[44:55.09]Or something like that.
[44:56.67]I don't know.
[44:57.65]Math is not my strong suit.
[44:58.83]Alright, what's the next one?
[45:00.89]I'm not buying that.
[45:01.55]I don't want that fucking dumb thing.
[45:04.48]Okay, doesn't everybody say that owns a boat?
[45:07.72]It's just a hole that you throw money into.
[45:10.00]Ha!
[45:13.06]If that's what people say about a boat, and then people say, oh, when you own a home, oh, be aware when you own a home, you got all kinds of maintenance you got to do.
[45:23.42]A boat and a home combined seems like a lot of money to just put in and throw away.
[45:36.19]At that point, this should be like just a mechanic that lives in the house with you.
[45:39.91]Okay, a new chapter.
[45:42.21]Moonrise Bay welcomes Hiroshi and Yuna with open arms.
[45:45.66]This young couple of computer engineers who both got jobs in town had been looking for a place to make their own.
[45:51.88]Help came from friends in the area who offered to sell them their unprofitable printing studio.
[45:56.79]Now the newcomers just need a little more help with changing it into a living space.
[45:59.99]Alright, let me help you.
[46:11.64]I'll never forget when you pushed me off that cruise ship in 98 as a joke.
[46:14.03]Hey, for...
[46:26.30]For $2,500, can you make a new house inside of the house that's here now?
[46:30.03]Great!
[46:30.15]They're big fans of this game.
[46:31.23]Wait, so I have to clean and then I have to do a new chapter.
[47:02.83]What button do I press?
[47:03.47]How do I get out of here?
[47:05.51]Oh, just walk.
[47:10.81]I'm at the wrong door.
[47:11.94]Oh, wait.
[47:13.34]Well, this person needs the... Does everybody need their whole house renovated?
[47:16.88]I'm at the wrong door.
[47:18.94]Well, I'm not cleaning their door.
[47:22.02]Oh, boy.
[47:25.55]Alright, I have to change the stairs.
[47:35.62]Okay.
[47:37.92]You got a pretty good view.
[47:38.87]Change that window out.
[47:41.75]How much do I get for this?
[47:42.63]Oh, wait.
[47:43.35]My budget's $26,000.
[47:45.47]Never mind.
[47:45.89]I said $3,000.
[47:51.39]They're paying.
[47:52.03]They're paying.
[47:52.45]Alright.
[47:53.05]I jumped the gun on that one.
[47:54.86]I apologize.
[48:00.89]I kind of want to dispose of this.
[48:01.91]Alright.
[48:02.21]Do I... Hold on a minute.
[48:03.73]Are they going to be mad that I'm going to wipe the paint off?
[48:08.78]Or is that like a don't touch that?
[48:10.08]That adds to like the aesthetic of the apartment.
[48:14.98]Right?
[48:15.30]I feel like that could be like a point of contention.
[48:20.93]Who wants paint?
[48:21.41]I don't know.
[48:21.77]Like it's... Well, look.
[48:22.51]Look at all the... It's like all the paint on the ground and stuff.
[48:26.97]No.
[48:27.13]I don't know.
[48:35.54]What is this stuff?
[48:36.52]Why are there just gigantic filters here, like water filters?
[48:41.06]These pool filters?
[48:42.00]What are these?
[48:42.48]Alright, let me get the shit out of the way.
[48:54.91]Drew, did you see the new Fortnite item shop?
[48:56.61]I have never opened a Fortnite.
[49:01.51]I've not got that far.
[49:06.21]Something always comes up that's more important.
[49:07.87]Isn't this all kind of trash?
[49:15.14]Liar.
[49:15.46]I mean, I've opened the EXE file.
[49:21.12]I've never actually gone into a game.
[49:22.46]I've never looked at the store.
[49:23.49]This is kind of a mess.
[49:29.63]This is a mess.
[49:38.09]This looks like when I close my eyes and put my hands on my eyes.
[49:45.60]Stream Fortnite for 500k off the debt.
[49:48.10]The only way I will ever stream Fortnite is if I do the Fortnite joke.
[49:52.93]And I'll tell it to you again.
[49:54.37]Because... I... Just in case it ever happened.
[49:59.23]I'm gonna be in like a backwards hat.
[50:02.05]With big sunglasses on.
[50:03.59]In like a... Like a tank top.
[50:08.00]I'm gonna be in like a lit up room.
[50:12.44]And in the room, I'm just gonna be sitting there with a vape pen.
[50:15.47]Or like a big vapor.
[50:16.31]And I'm just gonna vape and play Fortnite.
[50:20.77]And I'm gonna have, I don't know why I think this is kind of funny, but I'm gonna make my, like, I'm gonna put my voice changer on just like a tiny bit.
[50:26.52]And just like talk shit.
[50:29.42]To people.
[50:30.06]While I play.
[50:31.50]And slowly over time.
[50:32.58]The whole room is going to.
[50:33.94]Like in the face cam.
[50:34.78]There's going to be a face cam at the bottom.
[50:36.58]Slowly over time.
[50:38.18]You're going to notice that.
[50:39.46]It's just like.
[50:40.30]You can.
[50:40.64]It's starting to get way too foggy in there.
[50:43.69]And it's going to get to a point.
[50:44.55]Where you can't see me anymore.
[50:46.25]I'm covered in fucking fog.
[50:50.47]And then you're going to start to hear.
[50:51.41]Like the fire alarm.
[50:54.13]And the stream is going to end.
[50:55.89]When like a fireman.
[50:57.12]Breaks down the drywall behind me.
[51:03.33]I have talked about making that joke for like four years.
[51:07.28]And I've just never done it.
[51:10.56]You could probably go back to timestamps of me talking about this.
[51:14.70]From like 2015, 2016.
[51:15.26]Actually, this is kind of cool.
[51:22.49]Alright, let's go.
[51:28.91]Why is there a break room in the apartment?
[51:32.29]Well, because it's a...
[51:34.90]I'm selling all this stuff, right?
[51:40.22]Yeah.
[51:40.64]Because it used to be an art studio.
[51:45.34]It's a kitchen.
[51:46.78]Wait, what?
[51:50.13]Is there no kitchen downstairs?
[51:55.27]That's kind of weird.
[51:59.77]So there's no... The kitchen's up... It's a room next to the bedroom?
[52:05.79]Is this a bedroom?
[52:06.62]What is this?
[52:08.78]This is the closet.
[52:10.62]What's going on here?
[52:13.86]It was a printing press.
[52:16.28]Yeah.
[52:16.64]Alright, let me get rid of all the trash first.
[52:22.87]Is that all the tables too?
[52:25.39]Yeah, get rid of these fucking tables.
[52:27.67]Get rid of these old doors.
[52:33.13]These are all messed up.
[52:37.64]Change out this window.
[52:38.44]When are you going to play Among Us?
[52:41.96]I told you I'm going to play Among Us when the Among Us VR comes out.
[52:51.31]Did I just sell everything?
[52:52.01]I don't know if I'm supposed to be doing this, but I did it.
[52:59.18]Should I take this wall down too?
[53:02.50]Oh, I can't.
[53:05.73]It's already out.
[53:07.15]Well, I mean, I'm doing VR in January.
[53:10.93]Should I go over the content plans again because more people are here?
[53:20.46]This would be a nice room.
[53:25.22]Yeah, sure.
[53:25.64]Alright.
[53:26.86]House Flipper today.
[53:28.65]Christmas Eve.
[53:30.29]Hold on.
[53:35.13]I hate, okay.
[53:36.91]House Flipper today, Christmas Eve, Ichio Compilation Night.
[53:42.98]And then 27th, we're going to do Organ Trader Simulator or whatever it is, the game where you trade organs like a stock market.
[53:52.10]And after that, on New Year's Eve is going to be the Rumble.
[53:59.50]And the awards.
[54:01.90]On Christmas Eve, I'll make sure to let you know where the poll is so you can vote.
[54:04.64]This is actually another reason why I want to stream.
[54:08.38]Because I want to make sure people know where it is and when it's there.
[54:12.44]And then after that, we're going to do VR for a couple weeks.
[54:14.94]So that's where Among Us VR will be.
[54:18.95]I'm just going to go into a random lobby.
[54:20.45]I'm going to announce myself as the sus guy.
[54:22.09]I'm going to get roaring applause and then uninstall the game and never open it again.
[54:28.76]And after that, there's a big stream, which you will not have any information on because I'm not going to give you anything.
[54:35.80]Somewhere in like the third or fourth week of January.
[54:38.20]I'll give you a hard date on that when I get it.
[54:39.78]There's a lot going on.
[54:44.47]Should be a lot of fun.
[54:51.85]And what about Monster Rancher?
[54:53.25]No, Monster Rancher is not over.
[54:56.18]You might see that on the 27th, depending on how much fun I'm having in that organ trader simulator.
[55:04.81]I still have to beat that game.
[55:06.33]I love that game.
[55:10.45]I have to sell 41 objects in here?
[55:12.41]I have to sell the entire place.
[55:15.23]Oh, jeez.
[55:20.19]What about this?
[55:20.61]All this stuff could be repurposed, though.
[55:24.82]You could, like, spin this around, connect the two pieces, and make it a bed.
[55:38.13]It's called House Flipper.
[55:42.97]I know what it's called.
[55:47.17]Oh, you're condescending little comment.
[55:52.92]I could never be like that with you guys.
[55:54.38]I really don't think I... I don't think I could ever actually be like that.
[55:59.80]That kind of makes me feel bad and odd.
[56:02.10]I'm stuck in the window.
[56:03.95]Okay.
[56:21.61]More stuff to s- Oh.
[56:33.64]What'd I make last time?
[56:34.46]After like doing a little bit of tutorial stuff, I did the saw house, right?
[56:38.85]I have no idea what I'm gonna do now.
[56:43.47]at some point it's gonna be like just improv yell out a few words and a place and an actor huh uh snow uh sheldon from breaking bad and um a doctor's office okay
[57:13.68]Big bang theory.
[57:14.40]Alright, so new stairs.
[57:19.16]I don't know what they like.
[57:25.32]Whatever.
[57:25.60]Alright.
[57:40.34]Really quick question.
[57:41.99]Do you think Sheldon would be a meth user character in Breaking Mad?
[57:48.07]Or a meth creator?
[57:50.33]That's a tricky one.
[57:51.31]It could go either way.
[57:59.12]I have to actually clean this.
[58:01.80]User, easy.
[58:11.63]No, this would scare the shit out of me.
[58:13.31]Do you have an idea what this sounds like?
[58:16.86]It's like... That's like loud and scary at your door.
[58:23.82]Okay, now we need to do... Okay, it's time to get some decoration in here.
[58:42.75]Sell object.
[58:43.43]What else?
[58:46.53]Oh, but it's so cute.
[58:53.87]Hurt in the corner?
[58:54.66]Thank you.
[58:54.94]Appreciate it.
[59:02.72]Sell the toilet.
[59:03.38]Alright, we're not... This is not a custom job.
[59:12.52]What's the point of having a window?
[59:17.78]This window has one purpose.
[59:20.88]And that's to jump up here, open it like this, crouch, lift, and fart out of here because you don't want anyone in the house to know you did it.
[59:30.95]This serves no other purpose.
[59:39.24]It doesn't do anything else.
[59:48.78]That reminds me of the windows that... No.
[59:50.50]I don't... Why?
[59:51.77]I need to open the whole window.
[59:54.53]It's not enough.
[60:02.57]You can't run away and fart somewhere in this house.
[60:05.82]It's just a big open room.
[60:09.42]There's not even a bathroom.
[60:10.34]Oh, there is.
[60:10.82]Never mind.
[60:12.84]What?
[60:13.16]No.
[60:13.32]I don't know.
[60:14.28]I don't want to... Nope.
[60:15.28]Nope.
[60:18.72]Now, I'm going like this.
[60:19.58]I'm opening this, and I'm gonna stand up here, brace my legs here, push up, and I'm gonna, like, fart out this corner.
[60:27.71]And I'm gonna count to ten.
[60:29.17]Because don't ever count to three or four.
[60:31.11]It's not enough.
[60:33.31]And I'm gonna close it and be like, hey, so what's going on up here, man?
[60:37.84]Yeah, I'm just checking out downstairs.
[60:38.92]It's a pretty slick place you got here.
[60:48.55]Wait, why can't you do that with a regular window?
[60:57.41]Because... No, my point was it's... This is the only thing you can do with this window.
[61:03.90]It doesn't do anything.
[61:10.62]You just sounded 50 years old there for a second.
[61:12.60]Alright, stop distracting me.
[61:15.50]I've got things to do.
[61:20.72]Alright.
[61:22.42]Cell object.
[61:24.08]Alright, we need to modify the walls.
[61:25.20]We gotta paint the walls.
[61:25.92]They want the walls painted white?
[61:28.42]Easy.
[61:28.66]Done.
[61:40.81]That's it?
[61:43.85]Wait, that's all the paint you want on the walls?
[61:52.15]Um... That's very weird.
[61:55.71]Okay.
[61:59.81]Uh... Alright, what do they want?
[62:02.19]They want this covered.
[62:05.39]Where's this even gonna go?
[62:06.21]Alright, if we're gonna go with the... If they got wood, then... Let's just make it all wood.
[62:17.78]I'm so bad at this shit.
[62:24.45]Where should this even go?
[62:25.17]Okay.
[62:37.97]Standing set.
[62:38.67]Is this where I should put this?
[62:44.99]This is a weird house.
[62:49.17]Okay.
[62:54.04]Cupboard.
[62:57.36]I don't care about this.
[62:58.24]This is not my house.
[62:58.82]I don't care.
[63:07.47]Why can't I... It has to be against a wall.
[63:14.17]How about right here?
[63:14.77]A filing cabinet.
[63:17.12]I don't know.
[63:21.46]Oh, this is the oven.
[63:22.28]Alright.
[63:24.36]Isn't the kitchen supposed to be upstairs?
[63:34.43]The oven right next to the door like this.
[63:41.51]Somebody opening up the door, it's just bang, there you are.
[63:44.39]I'm in straight to cooking.
[63:55.39]I actually don't hate it.
[63:58.89]None of this matters.
[63:59.51]We're just trying to blow through this so I can get to the big house so I can actually make my dream house.
[64:04.11]It's going to be a long one today, guys.
[64:05.49]This is not going to be like a three-hour stream.
[64:07.10]This is going to be a long one.
[64:08.02]I hope you're ready.
[64:11.22]What a dumb fridge.
[64:17.40]It looks like a school locker.
[64:19.40]What is that?
[64:32.49]Yeah, I don't care about any of this person's shit.
[64:34.55]Who cares?
[64:40.04]They can decorate it their... They can do it their own way.
[64:42.36]I'm just putting the stuff they want in the house.
[64:45.42]This is tutorial Andy shit.
[64:46.70]I'm out of here.
[64:50.61]How many chairs do you want?
[64:52.57]They want two or three of these.
[64:53.37]Two.
[64:54.59]Two.
[65:02.11]I want a bench okay green wall module oh you want a nice moss wall dude um whatever alright I'll put it up here two of these right
[65:34.00]This house sucks.
[65:43.83]I don't care how bad this sucks.
[65:47.77]How many times do I have to make it clear?
[65:50.85]This is not my house.
[65:52.30]I care nothing about it.
[66:08.99]Why would you look at all this?
[66:10.05]I don't... Wooden sliding door?
[66:14.26]Okay.
[66:31.07]Another wooden sliding door.
[66:35.83]Explain it two more times.
[66:37.87]You get it.
[66:47.58]Alright.
[66:49.96]We need another one of these.
[66:55.66]The ambient piano music.
[66:57.08]Yeah.
[66:58.92]It's nice.
[66:59.38]It's quite nice.
[66:59.98]It's quite nice.
[67:01.10]Okay.
[67:04.70]Double bed teddy.
[67:05.82]Where should I put the bed?
[67:13.76]Right here.
[67:22.88]Oh, come on, I can't... It's just- there's just enough room for a bed.
[67:30.88]Where's the bed go?
[67:33.90]Up here?
[67:34.24]I feel like lying in this bed... That's fine.
[67:54.08]Lay floor tiles.
[67:55.50]Light oak mosaic.
[67:56.86]Isn't that what's already on the ground?
[67:58.00]This is uglier.
[68:05.67]These are kitchen tiles.
[68:21.22]I'm just going by what the customer wants me to do.
[68:25.12]I- I'm not- this is what the customer said to do.
[68:33.45]You and I might think this looks really weird.
[68:38.90]Somebody just said I have no confidence.
[68:43.75]This is not my house.
[68:45.07]I'm trying to speedrun this so we get to go by the big house so that I can actually do what I want to do.
[68:48.67]I want to take down walls.
[68:49.75]I want to have, like, a dining room.
[68:50.93]I want to have a showcase room.
[68:54.42]I want to have a room where, like, a game show room.
[68:58.24]Like, a showcase.
[68:59.00]Like, Price is Right.
[69:00.36]Alright, so that's done up there.
[69:09.71]Think of someone else for once in your life.
[69:12.11]People that are moving into this house are not real.
[69:15.23]They are imaginated people that the developers made to teach you some of the new things that are in the new update.
[69:21.67]I don't care about these imaginary people.
[69:23.35]All I care about is myself and my real imaginary world, which is my fake house that I'm about to build because it's me making it.
[69:36.25]Oof.
[69:37.89]Got a little heated there.
[69:42.12]Oh, TV.
[69:42.52]Can I put it up there?
[69:49.25]I can't put it... Oh, it has to be sitting on something.
[69:59.45]Oh, like this.
[70:00.53]Kind of reminds me of the first house everybody makes in The Sims.
[70:08.69]This big open square.
[70:11.87]And the TV is far away from everything else, and there's just a big table in the middle.
[70:18.12]And nobody knows shit about how to design cabinets, so everybody's house looks like this in The Sims.
[70:29.72]You guys can all sit there and criticize my choice of cabinets, but we all scroll over that.
[70:37.21]We just scroll by it.
[70:42.40]What is this?
[70:43.02]Oh, wardrobe.
[70:43.70]Okay.
[70:48.30]Two of these?
[70:48.62]Is this a fridge?
[70:57.29]No.
[71:00.35]This is the wrong spot.
[71:06.93]Why is it so dark in here?
[71:12.88]Ooh.
[71:16.20]This stuff is cool, but I really don't think I'll have enough clothes to fit in the first three.
[71:20.74]Then nothing else will ever be used.
[71:22.60]Go get the paint, bestie.
[71:26.95]Faded mirror?
[71:32.25]Oh, paint with white.
[71:32.97]Cool.
[71:35.13]It's dark in here.
[71:36.05]How do I...
[71:43.46]Bestie.
[71:46.58]Is there no light switch to turn these lights on?
[71:54.89]You're now manually breathing.
[71:56.35]You can't get me with that one.
[72:02.81]It's so dark.
[72:03.95]Ah, there we go.
[72:11.49]Shit was already white in here.
[72:13.79]What a waste of money.
[72:20.15]Waste of money.
[72:25.72]But it's whiter.
[72:30.90]Now you're going to tell me it's going to brighten up the room.
[72:33.40]Now I don't want to be in a room that's this bright white.
[72:40.47]People will see how yellow my teeth are.
[72:49.43]For all my friends that shave, when you get the shaving cream on your face, and you go, my teeth are fucking green.
[72:58.84]What is going on?
[73:03.04]Y'all know that.
[73:10.07]You look in the mirror, you smile, you go, why are my teeth like fucking green and gray and shit?
[73:28.18]I'm telling you, it's weird.
[73:35.52]I take good care of my teeth, please.
[73:37.08]Nobody shaves?
[73:56.04]What do you mean nobody shaves here?
[73:59.38]What are you implying?
[74:00.48]Are you implying something?
[74:04.80]What's that supposed to mean?
[74:05.40]I don't care.
[74:26.49]Oh wow!
[74:36.12]Yeah, what a makeover.
[74:50.57]What's the next?
[74:52.85]Can I buy it now?
[74:54.82]I can't buy it.
[74:55.94]Why can I only buy this houseboat?
[75:03.56]Alright, I think this is where we're gonna get a big house.
[75:05.65]There's one here.
[75:08.81]Lousy contractors.
[75:11.53]There's another one somewhere.
[75:14.53]Whoa, what's this one?
[75:16.13]Business as usual.
[75:17.85]A businessman with extraordinary taste wants to have an apartment close to his company headquarters.
[75:22.47]Therefore, he purchased this one, previously owned by a party-loving editor-in-chief of a famous angling magazine.
[75:29.94]Coincidentally, it turned out a very special girl also works nearby.
[75:33.48]Christopher already has a list of ideas when it comes to necessary changes.
[75:38.17]Alright, bare minimum.
[75:40.09]Where are we going?
[75:42.37]The Walker family trusted the wrong people when it came to working on their new home.
[75:46.23]Okay.
[75:46.87]Benjamin, a very gentle man, didn't manage to keep them in check and his wife Naomi had to step in.
[75:52.74]When she'd gotten back from a business trip, she was astonished by the state of the house.
[75:56.52]At this point, they need a true professional who'll be... I want to do this one.
[76:02.37]What happened?
[76:03.15]What?
[76:10.01]What'd you hire?
[76:10.91]The Tasmanian Devil?
[76:12.03]He couldn't stop them.
[76:19.07]You don't understand.
[76:21.39]He's this purple guy and he's got a big mouth.
[76:32.13]His mouth is the size of his whole body and he spins and he was holding a hammer.
[76:38.45]I hid in the bathroom for four hours.
[76:40.07]Purple.
[76:40.23]The Tasmanian Devil is purple.
[76:57.85]Yeah, what?
[77:03.55]What do you mean he's not purple?
[77:05.39]What are you talking about?
[77:07.78]Wait, did I do this?
[77:11.96]I think me and this guy work for the same company because I feel like I did that shit to people when I played this before.
[77:17.60]He's brown?
[77:22.17]No, the Tasmanian Devil is not.
[77:24.33]What are you talking about?
[77:27.06]Asmanian devil.
[77:35.92]Oh, I'm thinking about his little fucking son there.
[77:40.09]Dizzy.
[77:44.21]From Tiny Toons.
[77:45.65]I'm thinking about his son.
[77:47.73]Yeah.
[77:50.11]Whatever.
[77:50.41]Wrong animal.
[77:51.01]Who cares?
[77:52.95]He's lit- He's not- Alright, I'm gonna- I have to shut everybody up because I need to put Dizzy Devil on stream right now.
[78:02.34]Dizzy Devil is Tasmanian's- Tasmanian Devil's bastard son or something.
[78:06.06]I have no idea.
[78:06.70]What do you mean fake?
[78:12.34]It's not fake.
[78:15.72]I'll show you right now.
[78:19.18]This is Dizzy Devil.
[78:24.30]No, I didn't come up with this in a dream.
[78:25.92]This is a character in Tiny Toons.
[78:29.11]See, that's who came through the house.
[78:33.87]This means the Tasmanian Devil has had sex.
[78:37.55]Yes.
[78:44.68]So, if two Tasmanian Devil characters have sex, did they just scream at each other and run around the house and spin around?
[78:51.82]How does that happen?
[79:02.67]That's a question I've not thought of.
[79:11.60]New topic, please, please.
[79:13.22]Twitch, ban him.
[79:16.64]The worst thing we've talked about on this stream is how, in quotes, how does the Tasmanian devil have sex?
[79:23.38]That's where you draw the line.
[79:27.12]The last time I played this game, I put a sex swing upstairs.
[79:33.46]Give me a break.
[79:40.37]Alright, so they trashed the place.
[79:41.99]This place is kind of swanky.
[79:45.85]I like it.
[79:49.25]Imagine the sounds he would make.
[79:54.94]I don't think they would be very different.
[79:56.58]I don't think it would be different.
[80:06.14]Would it be?
[80:06.76]I'm curious.
[80:27.24]What does he sound like?
[80:28.00]No, we don't.
[80:34.17]Hold on He's always on the loose
[81:05.14]Okay, so that's what the Tasmanian Devil just sounds like.
[81:11.50]So I'm gonna assume it would be a little slower.
[81:16.02]If it was a little bit slower, it would sound something like this.
[81:39.22]Interesting He sounds like the drive-thru guy from yesterday
[82:17.79]Ugh.
[82:19.27]Somebody said, clear your history.
[82:22.58]It's just the Tasmanian devil screaming.
[82:24.58]Alright.
[82:33.72]For those folks at home, if you want, go ahead and do your own little fun, little project.
[82:39.59]What you do is you take what we just did
[82:43.97]and you have you make two of those tracks and then you make pitch one of them up or pitch one of them down doesn't matter there I'm not gonna do it here okay let's uh let's continue
[83:08.68]Do the tutorial.
[83:10.60]I was about to Tasmanian Devil.
[83:11.97]I was about to scream Tasmanian Devil on you.
[83:14.71]I was going to drop that on the stream.
[83:19.23]I was about to drop right on the stream a full-on Tasmanian Devil, but I've talked about it before and I'm not going to... No, we've done this routine before.
[83:29.58]Well, not that last one exactly, but this one.
[83:33.46]You cannot do a Tasmanian Devil impression unless you go 100% all-in as hard as you can.
[83:41.55]You can't half-ass a Tasmanian Devil.
[83:43.63]You go all-in or don't do it at all.
[83:48.90]I'm not doing it.
[83:50.12]No.
[83:55.70]Do it.
[83:55.92]You gotta go all-in.
[83:56.66]Do it.
[83:57.96]No.
[83:58.74]I don't have the confidence that I can go all-in right now.
[84:04.08]I really don't think I have the confidence to do it right this minute.
[84:07.20]Alright, let's modify it.
[84:10.06]Let's... Hold on.
[84:10.76]There's so much trash everywhere.
[84:20.32]This is really pretty.
[84:23.68]Do it.
[84:24.00]We need to sample it.
[84:25.62]You're not sampling shit.
[84:27.76]By the way.
[84:29.96]Buddy.
[84:33.95]Maybe I don't have to clean the windows anymore.
[84:35.13]Alright, we'll just do the bathroom first.
[84:41.33]We're here.
[84:42.65]It's clean.
[84:43.09]Alright, they want to remove trash.
[84:45.83]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[84:46.88]That's fine.
[84:47.22]Alright, they want to do wall tiles.
[84:50.28]Are these wall tiles?
[84:51.56]What are these?
[84:58.14]Ooh, I like this.
[84:59.20]This is smoky.
[85:01.80]I'm not your buddy.
[85:02.66]Alright, pal.
[85:09.35]Okay, pal.
[85:12.19]Settle down.
[85:22.47]Hey, friendo.
[85:32.08]Sans.
[85:34.14]No.
[85:35.80]Wait, did you actually have the clip?
[85:37.54]You already... Alright, so... How long ago was this?
[85:42.49]This clip that you're about to hear was from like a year or two ago.
[85:45.89]A lot of you guys might not have heard it.
[85:47.15]This is me trying to do the Tasmanian Devil going all in.
[85:57.69]You can't do it.
[85:58.66]And I laughed at the end.
[86:00.08]You can't do it.
[86:07.80]It's impossible.
[86:10.39]I did it again after that.
[86:11.45]I did?
[86:11.73]Do you have documented evidence of me doing it again?
[86:18.47]Why did I do it twice?
[86:22.85]What do I have to do?
[86:24.48]Alright.
[86:25.26]Snowy marble.
[86:26.66]And, oh, they want both.
[86:28.84]Oh, I see what you're trying to do here.
[86:31.88]That one wasn't good.
[86:32.58]That was not the real attempt.
[86:46.19]What was that?
[86:46.79]That was... It's inside the window.
[86:50.94]I thought... I don't know why.
[86:51.80]I just thought somebody shot me with a gun.
[86:52.80]I don't know why.
[86:54.16]That was weird.
[86:59.46]Big stream in January.
[87:01.24]Alright, there you go.
[87:01.84]There you go.
[87:02.12]You got it.
[87:02.72]It was two years ago.
[87:05.31]Wait, hold on.
[87:09.19]Are these different streams?
[87:10.73]You want me to go all in?
[87:11.47]I'll go all in.
[87:12.29]Wait, did I do this on two separate streams like more than like six months apart?
[87:29.76]I can't do it again.
[87:32.54]You need to slow this down.
[87:39.92]no I hold on should I try it again hold on I I have to let me hold on a minute if I cheat I could probably get it let me let me cheat I'll cheat I'll see if I can get it in the world of voice work they they do this stuff okay third time's a charm here we go
[88:16.18]I'm not doing it with a face cam, are you kidding me?
[88:18.16]No.
[88:23.24]Mute this.
[88:24.42]Mute this, because I want to be able to have this as a... I don't want you to have any sound in the background.
[88:34.34]Okay, I'm gonna pass out.
[88:44.55]Alright, I'm okay.
[88:45.75]I'm alright.
[88:46.19]I'm alright.
[88:47.71]I'm okay.
[88:48.67]How did that one sound?
[88:50.37]Did that one sound okay?
[88:57.08]Was that one better than the other ones?
[88:58.04]Can I hear it?
[89:04.56]What do you mean fecal funny?
[89:05.58]The Tasmanian devil sticks his tongue out at the end and goes with his tongue.
[89:11.53]Was that better than the last one?
[89:12.51]Was it unironically good?
[89:13.99]Find out.
[89:17.05]Are you kidding me?
[89:17.77]No.
[89:22.83]Mute this.
[89:24.01]Mute this because I want to be able to have this as a... I don't want you to have any sound in the background.
[89:29.54]Well, I have sound.
[89:38.83]No, I don't think that was really- I don't think that was good.
[89:41.13]I don't think that was good.
[89:41.83]That wasn't even close.
[89:45.78]That was just the guy from Star Wars.
[89:50.20]That was the frog guy from Star Wars.
[89:52.18]That was not the Tasmanian Devil.
[89:55.88]That was- I was just shaking my face.
[89:58.82]That was not even close.
[90:01.80]Not even close.
[90:02.98]That's not even fucking close.
[90:09.36]yeah from uh the phantom menace because listen to the other one the other one is so much better because the tasmanian devil has a very distinct he goes like right and it's all over the place see like the pitch changes and stuff this is just me shaking my face and screaming
[90:48.83]Play them together, it will be perfect.
[90:51.17]Oh my god, you're right.
[90:52.45]It actually would be.
[90:53.77]I gotta get this queued up.
[90:55.73]Okay, I'm done.
[91:03.22]We're not doing this anymore.
[91:04.08]You want me to go all in?
[91:04.84]I'll go all in.
[91:05.34]No, I'm not going- You want me to go all in?
[91:12.64]You're arguing with yourself.
[91:14.20]Okay.
[91:16.58]Do Dizzy this time?
[91:17.96]Wait, Dizzy is different!
[91:19.16]Hold on, I'm curious.
[91:20.62]Don't leave.
[91:21.22]Please don't leave.
[91:25.17]Maybe I could do Dizzy better.
[91:37.91]Nope.
[91:40.95]Dizzy devil.
[92:00.12]I can't go all the way.
[92:01.42]I can't.
[92:17.97]Dizzy devil sound.
[92:19.43]I need to find a good one.
[92:21.06]Oh.
[92:23.92]Why is there no audio of Dizzy Devil, but there's a million of Tasmanian Devil?
[92:33.91]Dizzy Devil Tornado?
[92:40.05]All there is is like a wiki page.
[92:43.88]It's like the guy that the all there is that I can find in like the video section is the Tasmanian devil dizzy devil tornado and then the guy that does this with the tornado behind him This thing that like You're not talking about that's the only thing I can find I

[93:52.52]Uh, let's put the bathroom in.
[93:53.60]Alright, we need to put a, uh, delicate bathtub.
[94:07.83]Ooh, no, don't do it.
[94:10.03]There's already too many of those.
[94:14.51]This thing's huge.
[94:15.39]What?
[94:18.45]This thing's weird.
[94:29.06]Very nice.
[94:30.50]Very nice.
[94:30.92]Finish the walls, you lunatic.
[94:33.68]No, I don't care.
[94:34.36]I'm just trying to unlock stuff.
[94:41.63]We're just getting only 60%.
[94:43.29]That's it.
[94:43.81]Come on, let's ban people.
[94:50.54]Well, you don't have to.
[94:51.16]Okay.
[94:53.78]Compact...
[94:56.68]What was it?
[94:57.02]Compact WC Inu?
[94:59.24]Oh, it's a toilet.
[95:03.08]Might as well have it match.
[95:16.87]Mountable shower.
[95:17.65]How about this one?
[95:25.63]How am I supposed to put this?
[95:26.83]How am I supposed to do this?
[95:28.83]Oh, okay.
[95:29.11]Let's get out of the way.
[95:29.79]Right in the corner?
[95:43.30]I would love to mount a shower here.
[95:44.52]Did I do this wrong?
[95:53.92]Oh.
[95:55.22]Okay.
[96:06.31]Put it together.
[96:07.41]Very nice.
[96:07.85]Never mind, do a teehee for us.
[96:19.12]I already did.
[96:25.68]Ah, I'm good.
[96:38.99]Actually, I like the sounds this makes.
[96:42.53]Sounds really nice.
[96:45.16]It'll, like, ring, ring, ring.
[96:51.12]This is on easy mode.
[96:51.88]You can actually put this on hard, and I think it takes a lot longer.
[96:54.12]Cool.
[97:03.67]Alright.
[97:04.71]Now they want to mirror a mirror in Lamont.
[97:12.99]Mirror... Mirror Lamont.
[97:18.03]I think a good beach finish.
[97:19.59]Sounds good.
[97:20.03]I want a TV.
[97:28.63]That's a pretty... That would be like... That would be awesome.
[97:30.73]Just add a TV right here.
[97:33.13]Two mirrors.
[97:33.59]Oh, there's mirrors, right.
[97:40.60]No, I wouldn't want...
[97:45.00]This is not where I want that.
[97:49.28]What would the purpose of a mirror right here be?
[97:54.14]Just to watch yourself?
[98:00.77]Where's the sink gonna go right here?
[98:09.55]Sink.
[98:11.45]Is that not a sink?
[98:14.77]We're not doing a double sink, are we?
[98:16.01]These are wrong.
[98:31.22]Off center.
[98:32.89]It's not my house.
[98:37.83]Okay.
[98:41.99]Can this fit?
[98:50.42]Good.
[98:56.16]Good.
[98:58.30]Good.
[98:59.18]Good.
[99:00.11]Good.
[99:03.21]This mirror is not big enough.
[99:06.55]Alright, now we need to lay floor tiles.
[99:10.81]These ones.
[99:11.23]Sounds good.
[99:13.88]This is actually looking really nice.
[99:27.69]What happened?
[99:29.09]Is this the same?
[99:29.73]This is a Minecraft bathroom.
[99:40.51]Did I do this wrong?
[99:41.91]Lay wall tiles.
[99:46.39]Do they not want these on the ground?
[99:49.21]These are floor tiles.
[99:52.59]Did I do the wrong thing or is it just this ugly?
[100:00.07]No, it is like this.
[100:08.24]I don't know.
[100:08.56]It looks exactly the same.
[100:19.53]Five Nights at Freddy's flashlight.
[100:25.23]It actually is.
[100:26.05]How do you come up with that?
[100:28.87]That's so clever.
[100:41.09]It's just the Unity Light.
[100:46.26]Isn't Five Nights at Freddy's made... in... like, out of stone or something?
[100:52.85]It's not even made in a regular game engine, I thought.
[101:07.69]The original Five Nights at Freddy's was made in some weird game maker, wasn't it?
[101:11.93]It's not made in Unity.
[101:15.69]It was made in Fusion.
[101:16.95]Yeah.
[101:21.79]This bathroom gives me anxiety.
[101:24.11]I don't like it.
[101:26.31]Hey, I'm bumping you.
[101:29.03]I don't got to live here.
[101:29.73]I don't want...
[101:39.11]Alright, bathroom's done.
[101:39.85]I don't care.
[101:41.42]Wait.
[101:42.86]Hanger.
[101:46.04]Ooh, a little towel rack.
[101:47.86]I want one of these.
[101:58.71]I don't want, like, three of them.
[102:07.30]Christmas is coming?
[102:08.00]That's right.
[102:31.36]Rewind!
[102:33.22]Rewind!
[102:33.64]Rewind!
[102:34.12]Uh, where do I go?
[102:51.61]You scared the shit out of me?
[102:53.27]Yep!
[102:53.51]Toilet paper?
[102:57.62]Okay.
[103:02.06]Wait, this is the... I was wondering what this... I thought this was like a coat rack.
[103:04.76]I thought this was like a fireplace thing.
[103:08.22]This is for toilet paper?
[103:09.84]I'm gonna knock this over.
[103:13.24]You are going to reach for this and knock this over and get pissed, because then the toilet paper hits the ground.
[103:21.07]Why?
[103:21.49]That takes up so much space.
[103:27.03]Is this a backpack?
[103:30.61]This looked like a backpack from here.
[103:43.18]The counter's not big enough.
[103:54.67]I just... I just had to blink a few times.
[103:59.51]Did that freak anybody else out too?
[104:03.57]That was weird.
[104:04.33]Like opening it with the door moving.
[104:06.41]Because I still had it selected.
[104:07.43]That was kind of odd looking, wasn't it?
[104:11.84]Alright, this room is done.
[104:13.62]I don't need to do anymore.
[104:16.43]Just got to get to the progress and that's it.
[104:18.15]Get this out of here.
[104:30.81]The door isn't lined up, idiot.
[104:34.07]Oh.
[104:36.69]The door's not lined up.
[104:37.73]Oh no.
[105:08.33]I don't get much more joy in life than watching a stadium full of 15,000 people think that something's wrong with me.
[105:24.87]Alright.
[105:28.83]This looks nice.
[105:29.99]Sure.
[105:35.37]Because I'm not like this.
[105:42.16]How about this one?
[105:46.70]Why is it... Um, hello?
[105:50.93]Is this supposed to be inspiration bubbles or what?
[105:56.39]I don't get it.
[106:07.64]I guess it looks alright.
[106:13.34]He's sitting on the stage.
[106:14.74]Wait, hold on.
[106:15.64]He's sitting on the stage with his PC set up with a spotlight on top of him while 15,000 people just watch and throw popcorn at him.
[106:24.45]I think the more accurate thing would be half of you are on your phones watching someone else.
[106:31.03]I don't know why sometimes I feel like you're like the begrudging husband that went to the show.
[106:44.20]You gotta catch the game.
[106:46.74]You just, like, have me open the tab and you're doing something else.
[106:52.45]You got, like, the Golden Knights game on.
[106:54.05]Like, on your lap while you're at the show.
[107:10.58]Really cool.
[107:11.02]Okay.
[107:13.41]It was a wall finish.
[107:14.51]Hmm.
[107:14.79]How about this one?
[107:18.36]Not my house.
[107:18.88]Who cares?
[107:24.85]Irma likes hockey.
[107:25.63]No, I just pretend to to Lyft and Uber drivers.
[107:44.58]I need more of these.
[107:51.88]Oh, a big leather chair.
[107:54.40]Right here.
[108:10.57]Who do you think is going to win the English Premier League?
[108:14.60]If you had me tied down to a chair, and you said, hey, Jeremy, name one team in the English Premier League.
[108:24.25]I wouldn't be able to tell you.
[108:27.17]And it doesn't matter how many teeth you pulled out, I wouldn't be able to tell you.
[108:30.21]I don't know.
[108:44.35]This looks nice.
[108:51.15]I'm in a happy mood right now.
[108:53.79]Hope you guys are doing good.
[108:55.09]It's like the holiday season.
[108:56.15]I'm in the Christmas spirit.
[109:04.19]How are you?
[109:04.90]How are you actually?
[109:05.60]You doing alright?
[109:16.69]Hopefully you're doing okay.
[109:28.31]This is scary.
[109:28.73]Alright.
[109:29.47]There's a room that you turn in and there's like the Resident Evil character that just sits there and watches you and has a few pieces of dialog for you.
[109:40.45]Okay, this room's pretty good.
[109:51.06]Just gotta get to 65%.
[109:57.26]Chat.
[109:57.66]And Jerma, I guess.
[109:58.48]I just got the new Xbox.
[110:00.64]POG.
[110:02.76]Nice.
[110:04.36]Alright, nice.
[110:06.40]New Xbox in the chat.
[110:07.42]We got somebody with a new Xbox.
[110:15.98]Alright, there's got to be something that's really awful to get a bunch of points here.
[110:20.24]Or the garage or something, right?
[110:21.49]Oh, yeah.
[110:22.03]This is what's bringing my score down.
[110:31.31]Oh, good.
[110:32.00]Congratulations.
[110:40.46]Broken glass.
[110:41.32]Get it.
[110:50.03]Guys, I got great news.
[110:50.91]My sandwich is toasted.
[110:58.15]And it's buttery.
[111:00.49]It's flakey.
[111:02.54]It's good.
[111:04.84]I melted the cheese perfectly.
[111:06.10]Dude, perfect cheese melt.
[111:07.06]That's Pogs.
[111:07.52]Let's see Pogs in chat, please, for perfect melted cheddar cheese on this turkey and cheese sandwich.
[111:21.07]Okay.
[111:23.33]Okay, alright.
[111:23.85]Change the stairs.
[111:24.61]Yeah, that's fine.
[111:34.41]Getting there.
[111:34.83]Upstairs, I haven't done anything.
[111:40.11]I've done a lot of things upstairs.
[111:41.48]It's down here that I haven't done anything.
[111:45.24]Rage under the stairs.
[111:46.14]Yeah, thank you.
[112:00.07]Okay, need to do stuff down here.
[112:01.27]It was my birthday yesterday.
[112:12.84]Can you sing happy birthday?
[112:15.90]Happy birthday to you.
[112:17.34]Happy birthday to you.
[112:18.62]Happy birthday, dear chatter.
[112:22.14]Happy birthday to you.
[112:29.72]What color do you want?
[112:34.75]White.
[112:36.27]It's already here.
[112:50.28]Should I buy this house?
[112:52.18]Or should I wait and try to get the huge one?
[112:54.86]I know there's a huge one.
[113:01.91]Go for the huge one.
[113:02.57]Alright, if I get the huge house, I'm just gonna make a gigantic comedy theater.
[113:16.89]It's gonna be a theater.
[113:18.23]Okay.
[113:31.95]Install panels.
[113:37.11]Okay.
[113:37.91]Wait.
[113:39.01]I put the wrong thing in here.
[113:45.56]Shit.
[113:45.96]Oh well.
[113:49.67]Uh, it's fine.
[114:02.72]These are the kind of tiles you see on the floor where when you're doing the tour or if you're looking around and you see, wow, these are beautiful.
[114:09.53]Wow, look, I love that tile.
[114:12.27]You're going to replace that the second you move in.
[114:14.19]It's actually going to be first on the list.
[114:16.61]Is that it?
[114:24.44]It should be.
[114:26.24]Install panel.
[114:27.46]I need to install new panels.
[114:35.52]Do the yoinky-splanky now.
[114:41.11]No thanks.
[114:53.10]Put on some other music.
[114:55.82]Do you have anything to recommend?
[114:56.78]I think this is pleasant.
[115:06.51]It's pleasant.
[115:13.19]What's your best Half-Life 2 impersonation?
[115:14.79]I thought my computer just crashed.
[115:30.73]Alright, this is not the impression hour.
[115:33.31]I'm going to play the game.
[115:39.63]I'm just the kid at lunch.
[115:41.01]I've talked about it.
[115:42.77]I'm the kid at lunch.
[115:46.27]Hey, Jeremy, can you do an owl?
[115:49.13]And everybody laughs.
[115:56.37]Now do a wolf.
[115:59.31]And then I get detention.
[116:01.07]I get in trouble.
[116:04.67]You don't get in trouble.
[116:05.82]I'm the one that has to take the blow there.
[116:08.00]I have to hold the burden.
[116:14.82]Because Mrs. Stevenson's going over the test results.
[116:20.35]I have to stay after.
[116:21.21]It kind of looks like burnt.
[116:35.28]That's good enough.
[116:53.51]How am I going to fit a fridge in here?
[117:09.78]I'm just doing it for the points.
[117:10.98]Trust me.
[117:11.44]I'm just trying to unlock.
[117:12.46]I'm going to get to the point where I unlock the house that I want to use and the stream is going to be over.
[117:31.63]Nice.
[117:35.27]How close am I?
[117:45.06]What's the next big game you're looking forward to?
[117:46.68]Probably Elden Ring.
[117:48.18]That's the easy answer.
[117:58.23]I'm scared though because that's every single person says that.
[118:02.84]And the more that people collectively in their brain internalize how excited they are about a thing that comes out, it usually increases the chance that it's going to be bad.
[118:15.42]The universe does this weird thing.
[118:18.28]The more that people care about something before it releases, the worse they decide to make it.
[118:22.02]So I'm not trying to get too excited about it.
[118:41.84]Cyberpunk?
[118:42.64]Yeah.
[118:46.67]Although, who knows?
[118:47.27]This might be a No Man's Sky scenario.
[118:50.81]And two years from now, Cyberpunk is an amazing game.
[118:55.37]It could be.
[119:06.31]Do you believe in ghosts?
[119:10.92]I believe in radiators.
[119:15.68]Faulty hot water heaters.
[119:19.68]Bad radio signals.
[119:24.61]And wind that's strong enough to make the windows move around.
[119:30.61]If that answers your question.
[119:47.26]Alright, you want a vile damn right side shower.
[119:52.19]Do that.
[120:05.78]I don't know about ghosts.
[120:12.08]No, I don't know about ghosts.
[120:13.67]Too many people have died.
[120:19.94]All you would hear was the noise you hear at a baseball game.
[120:29.10]If people, like, are ghosts, and they're just walking around, just, like, kind of floating around, there would be, like, 70 billion ghosts just all talking over each other.
[120:41.72]Can I get rid of these?
[121:05.27]Do you believe in the Power Rangers?
[121:07.09]Yes.
[121:09.13]I do.
[121:09.99]Because the Power Rangers are real.
[121:12.85]Even though they are a fictional group of characters, they're actually in the costumes and they're actually pretending to fight stuff.
[121:20.51]I've had an experience with a Power Ranger before.
[121:24.12]Right?
[121:26.36]I've seen a Power Ranger.
[121:29.26]I've never had an experience with a ghost.
[121:32.50]And...
[121:37.20]I'm just realizing what I'm doing here.
[121:38.42]Okay.
[121:40.12]Doesn't look bad.
[121:49.82]That's about your experience with a Power Ranger.
[121:55.89]I don't, like, I don't... Watching the show, buying the toys...
[122:09.74]Going to Power Ranger Con and buying tickets for every panel?
[122:12.64]See, if Ghosts had Comic Con panels, I would probably believe more.
[122:32.28]Your theory of Power Rangers aren't real, but Ghosts aren't either then or something?
[122:35.91]I don't know.
[122:49.33]Do you believe in aliens?
[122:53.67]That one's tougher.
[122:55.22]Because on one hand, yes, I do.
[123:02.00]Do I think that there is somewhere, a galaxy or something that has sentient life?
[123:07.16]Probably.
[123:07.58]I mean, if we exist, then other people could exist too.
[123:11.68]I follow by the we exist therefore theory.
[123:16.97]If it happened once, it can happen again.
[123:23.85]I don't know exactly how accurate that is, but you never know.
[123:47.43]I'm speedrunning, trust me.
[123:56.29]But you don't want these down here.
[123:57.54]Yeah, you do.
[123:57.94]Okay.
[124:05.74]I'm just trying to get to the big, big house as fast as I can.
[124:08.66]I want to do my own work.
[124:16.06]I don't want to work for someone else.
[124:18.80]No, I want to do my own work.
[124:22.93]Close.
[124:23.45]Alright.
[124:23.91]What room has not even been touched yet?
[124:26.63]Right here.
[124:28.55]Doesn't work!
[124:45.01]Is the universe where you work a 9 to 5 and you aren't insane?
[124:47.91]Why do you think I'm insane?
[125:07.77]You are.
[125:08.19]Yeah, say that to me in real life.
[125:18.97]And I'll run, bro.
[125:19.87]I'm running.
[125:20.31]It's almost there.
[125:45.99]No, you said to me, I'm the coward.
[125:47.93]I'm the guy in Beauty and the Beast that hides behind Gaston.
[125:50.51]I actually don't hate this room, even though it sucks.
[126:07.53]Oh my God, look at how depressing this is for me.
[126:11.19]Just hold on, whoa.
[126:13.53]Just think, one day Jerma won't be popular.
[126:17.11]He'll just be another old guy in the supermarket.
[126:20.32]We might not even recognize him in the future.
[126:24.06]Holy shit.
[126:26.22]Wow.
[126:27.72]Oh my God.
[126:30.51]Oh my God.
[126:40.19]That is so, that's so sad.
[126:41.91]I just got like a weird image of me pushing a super, like a cart.
[126:49.67]Look at, old.
[126:54.18]Just kind of looking at the sails and stuff and being like, oh, that's, that's all those grapes are on sale.
[127:07.79]And then I get to the counter and I'm just like, excuse me.
[127:11.24]And my teeth, like both my dentures fell out.
[127:15.08]Excuse me.
[127:15.58]We're almost there.
[127:29.45]I bet you the big house is next and I can't wait.
[127:35.28]Uh, what about in here?
[127:36.78]Alright, yeah.
[127:37.48]I'll do this.
[127:42.72]Just gotta paint.
[127:43.46]After painting these walls, it should be good.
[127:52.42]Don't.
[127:52.82]Stop.
[127:53.08]This is wicked sad.
[127:54.49]I know.
[127:55.25]This is sad.
[127:57.99]And sad music playing, too.
[127:59.45]Don't you see me holding the grapes?
[128:04.19]With stringy hair with this music.
[128:11.43]And on the front of the package, it's some motto.
[128:13.51]It's like, look at me.
[128:17.21]I guarantee these are freshest grapes you'll ever see.
[128:19.80]And it's me holding, and I smile a little bit, and I'm like, look at me.
[128:23.90]Yeah.
[128:24.66]Yeah.
[128:39.83]Alright, this is actually kind of sad.
[128:41.05]I'm not going to do this anymore.
[128:43.91]This is sad.
[128:45.45]No more of this.
[128:51.43]I'm crying.
[128:52.33]Don't cry.
[128:52.77]Don't cry.
[129:11.03]Almost at that threshold.
[129:12.29]Come on, Gwyn.
[129:13.52]Let's see it.
[129:14.00]Come on.
[129:19.78]We'll be that old in 25 years.
[129:22.02]Yeah, 24 years is a long time.
[129:26.79]That's a long time.
[129:31.34]Think about years of your life and how much of it you've lived, but how much of it have you actually lived?
[129:37.53]How much have you truly been a sentient person that had decision-making skills?
[129:45.94]I think under 10 years old, you don't even know, like you don't even really know you're a person under five, right?
[129:55.00]You don't really start making like actual kind of memories that you hold onto till you're over five to 10 years old.
[130:01.12]So your first 10 years, you barely even have lived it.
[130:07.83]So I think about going from like 10 to like 15, 10 to 20, 15 to 30, and then like 30 to like 80.
[130:18.10]You've got a very long time of being like a sentient person.
[130:33.31]I forget about all the time sleeping.
[130:39.97]Yeah, but you need that.
[130:41.15]You need that to live.
[130:45.66]At what point do you stop being sentient?
[130:47.28]I don't know.
[130:52.68]But... I mean, like, what is brain activity?
[130:55.88]Right?
[130:56.20]Continues?
[130:58.48]What's the theory there?
[130:59.26]It kind of freaks me out.
[131:03.52]It's like your brain still has electrical impulse, like activity, after you pass away, doesn't it?
[131:11.04]So what happens there?
[131:12.30]Because your brain slows down.
[131:13.76]Do you like live for like a hundred million years or something?
[131:18.39]Like in your slowed down, slow, low electrical impulse brain?
[131:31.37]So nobody knows.
[131:38.73]That only lasts a couple hours?
[131:40.25]Well, that only lasts a couple hours to you.
[131:42.55]But what does that feel like?
[131:45.58]Because think about it.
[131:46.30]When you dream, you only dream for like five seconds.
[131:52.00]Right?
[131:52.68]But sometimes those dreams feel like you're there for an hour or two.
[132:00.95]That stuff freaks me out to a point where I kind of...
[132:04.89]Like the second that I'm dead, smash my head with a cinder block.
[132:09.08]Crush my head with a cinder block.
[132:10.27]I don't want to like live for an eternity in my own weird like electrical impulse brain thing.
[132:18.41]Because, like, what if they're too close?
[132:20.59]Okay, in the 10 seconds that it takes for, like, Uncle Gary to come up with the cinder block and just crush my head, I may have lived for 100,000 years already in my slowed-down electrical impulse kind of passing brain.
[132:45.56]Not to mention, Uncle Gary, the people in there, I've only told, Uncle Gary, I told this to.
[132:51.60]Hey, Uncle Gary, make sure I die.
[132:53.68]Make sure I die the second that I have flatlined.
[132:55.60]You smashed my head with a cinder block, Gary.
[133:00.43]What if the doctor's like, what are you doing?
[133:01.81]Put that down.
[133:02.63]That's another 100,000 years.
[133:07.43]Hey, I gotta do this.
[133:17.15]What if Gary doesn't finish the job?
[133:27.15]I might live for 500 million years.
[133:28.89]And I'll be sitting there after year number a million.
[133:31.38]I'm going to be like, I don't... I don't know what happened, but Gary didn't fucking finish the job apparently.
[133:40.54]Or Gary picks up the cinder block and like throws it.
[133:43.69]And then it hits me like the groin.
[133:47.63]And it didn't even get the job done and they like, they throw him out.
[134:01.51]Just enjoy eternity.
[134:15.40]It's a weird thought though, it really is.
[134:24.94]Everywhere at the end of time.
[134:27.50]I'm so close to being completed here.
[134:31.10]What does House Flipper do this to you, dude?
[134:32.78]Just paint the walls.
[134:35.86]I don't know.
[134:37.38]Okay.
[134:38.70]I go off.
[134:39.54]I pop the fuck off when I play House Flipper.
[134:41.47]You know why?
[134:41.95]Because it's one of the only times when my brain gets to... This is just a background thing going on.
[134:48.91]And it is occupying...
[134:51.16]It's occupying the part of my brain.
[134:53.92]Right?
[134:54.28]It's almost like my, like, the crazy part of my brain now can come out.
[134:58.33]Because the part that's keeping crazy Gary in there is now being occupied painting walls.
[135:04.99]And that's usually the defense.
[135:18.09]Please.
[135:18.40]Oh, right, I did it.
[135:23.83]That's alright.
[135:35.88]Can you imagine?
[135:38.44]Okay, and there he goes, he's passed.
[135:41.80]And somebody picks up a cinder block from behind the table.
[135:44.83]And it's just like, holy shit, bro.
[135:51.69]That image is insane.
[135:56.63]No, you don't understand.
[135:57.63]He told me he didn't want to stay stuck in a DMT flooded brain chemical dream.
[136:03.13]I had to.
[136:04.75]Look, I have it in writing.
[136:09.13]I sign it with like a blue Crayola crayon.
[136:22.62]Alright, what do you got?
[136:27.03]Just opened up another job.
[136:28.47]Is it in Big House?
[136:32.43]Oh, come on.
[136:33.03]Where is it?
[136:36.83]What is this?
[136:41.85]Crayon DNR.
[136:43.89]There's supposed to be three jobs here.
[136:48.47]Why can't I move?
[136:49.03]I'm an idiot.
[137:03.70]Where are these other missions?
[137:24.89]The arrows?
[137:25.49]Yeah, but I... I see this one.
[137:28.54]I see this one.

[173:29.12]Why do you want so many of these?
[173:30.42]What the hell are you doing?
[173:33.85]Painting Blizzard of Sorrow.
[173:36.37]Where do you want this fucking thing?
[173:50.32]Let's go.
[173:59.40]Ludwig is off Twitch.
[174:00.18]Can you take his username?
[174:03.15]No.
[174:03.61]What?
[174:09.03]What?
[174:09.19]You're saying you want me to squat on Ludwig's Twitch username?
[174:15.76]What the hell are you talking about?
[174:31.34]You should just redo your username and get the numbers off.
[174:37.11]No.
[174:38.17]No, they're just staying on.
[174:44.49]It's too late.
[174:46.39]I'm going on 11 plus years of the same name.
[174:52.96]At this point, if you know who I am, you know who I am.
[174:55.80]If you don't, then you don't.
[175:03.22]Alright, I'm buying something.
[175:05.02]I'm not renovating other people's houses.
[175:11.89]What did I unlock?
[175:17.23]What the hell?
[175:18.33]Okay, here we go.
[175:20.13]So I can get the loft?
[175:21.39]Or I can get that... This swanky one.
[175:28.64]I'm thinking of probably the swanky one.
[175:31.08]Or...
[175:33.25]It's a castle?
[175:37.58]Did I get the castle?
[175:39.16]$535,000.
[175:39.46]Oh my god.
[175:49.00]This might have been a mistake.
[175:57.80]Make it into your fortress.
[176:00.28]Oh yeah, I can make the comedy fortress.
[176:01.70]That's a good idea.
[176:08.76]Alright, how do I get rid of these?
[176:18.75]Yeah, this looks, this is dreary and dark and no, no, no.
[176:22.21]This big courtyard?
[176:23.52]Oh, I don't, wait, this is the ticket office.
[176:27.02]Okay, ticket office and then here's the main theater over here.
[176:31.84]No, is there a big room somewhere?
[176:33.90]Where's the biggest room in the house?
[176:40.64]Make a white castle.
[176:46.25]No, I'm not gonna make a white castle.
[176:48.07]I'm not gonna make a fast food restaurant, man.
[176:50.93]Alright, this is the ticket office.
[176:55.35]Clean this place up.
[177:07.32]Oh, shit.
[177:22.14]You're playing Phasmophobia now?
[177:51.60]I'm making a cinnamon twist.
[177:52.69]Relax.
[177:54.03]You don't have my vision.
[177:55.70]You don't have my vision.
[178:39.07]Oh wait, I have a lawnmower.
[178:46.78]Let's clean this place up.
[178:49.32]Ocean ghost.
[179:08.16]Oh, I got a new Gardener skill.
[179:19.47]Oh, the game just kind of did not like that.
[179:25.79]It's okay.
[179:26.75]What did I get?
[179:27.15]I skilled up?
[179:30.37]I definitely want... Mowing speed.
[179:35.63]Regulated mowing speed...
[179:38.83]Oh, whoops.
[179:46.28]Oh, music?
[179:46.81]Yeah.
[179:47.89]Yep.
[179:48.13]I only have $40,000.
[179:51.59]How am I going to buy anything?
[180:08.48]Golden Sun theme.
[180:12.42]It's a big house.
[180:13.40]I don't need to mow the back.
[180:20.30]No one's going back here.
[180:30.01]Oh shit, I just ran over a bunch of moles.
[180:35.29]That's not good.
[180:40.27]Oops.
[180:42.71]How about, um... Hmm.
[180:43.65]How about the Mischief Makers OST?
[180:50.92]Okay, bring it up.
[181:11.55]Best part is when the song goes... I need to remake this game.
[181:20.11]They've remade such dog shit in the past.
[181:23.67]Like, why would you not remake Mischief Makers?
[181:27.86]Why?
[181:37.30]Because it sucks?
[181:39.38]No, it does not.
[181:40.10]Have you played it?
[181:42.57]You've probably never played it.
[181:47.83]It's already perfect.
[181:50.74]Well, re-release it.
[181:51.98]Give it some updated input commands and graphics and stuff.
[181:55.04]We'll just update it.
[181:55.70]I'm almost done with the front at least.
[182:17.65]Treasure is basically dead.
[182:21.24]That's sad.
[182:21.70]Have you ever been to another country?
[182:33.38]I have not.
[182:33.80]Does Canada count?
[182:37.11]I don't count Canada.
[182:37.91]I just don't.
[182:47.51]Here it comes.
[182:50.49]Here it comes.
[183:02.36]Come to New Zealand.
[183:03.22]I'm not just going to go to New Zealand just for no reason.
[183:10.56]New Zealand, I'm sure, is a beautiful place.
[183:12.34]But it's too far for me to go.
[183:14.75]Alright, front yard looks pretty good.
[183:28.21]I would say so.
[183:37.35]Get out of your hobbit hole.
[183:41.71]Oh, it's warm, and there's grape jam, Gandalf.
[183:45.85]I just want my books, and my grape jam, and my comfortable chair, Gandalf.
[183:54.48]It's true.
[184:09.61]Now it's a little loud.
[184:10.43]Let me fix that.
[184:12.20]I got you.
[184:12.86]You need to come to your senses.
[184:21.36]This tree can stay.
[184:29.42]Come to Rivendare?
[184:30.52]Isn't that like Jughead Jones?
[184:36.04]Alright, we're mode.
[184:37.92]Clean.
[184:38.28]No, we're not.
[184:40.92]Must be perfect.
[185:02.23]You missed an inch-wide strip.
[185:04.16]Who cares?
[185:05.08]I've got a lot of internal work inside the castle to do.
[185:10.72]The outside, I don't really care about.
[185:12.08]I just don't want it to look gross.
[185:15.34]You talking about right here?
[185:16.06]Eh.
[185:20.49]Alright.
[185:22.69]Get out the sledgehammer.
[185:23.47]Alright, I need to take down... So, what... Can you go upstairs and do a theater?
[185:33.36]Okay, was it Edgar Allan Poe or something?
[185:34.64]Alright, what's up here?
[185:37.27]If I take this wall down... How much outdoor space?
[185:45.63]Here to all this shit.
[185:53.10]Oh, Gandalf, my books!
[185:56.56]You don't need these anymore.
[186:00.98]Gandalf!
[186:04.11]For all I know, Bilbo, he'll be dead in a few years.
[186:23.66]Oh, cigarette stains.
[186:42.39]We're going to turn this around.
[186:44.01]Just you wait and see.
[186:50.05]If you come up the stairs here... What is all of the steps?
[187:01.92]We're selling.
[187:10.26]That's not inviting.
[187:15.90]We don't talk about how Gandalf was 80% sure that Bilbo was dead on that journey.
[187:32.90]Didn't Gandalf just like smoke a bunch of crack and think that it was a good idea to send a hobbit into Mount Doom?
[187:39.22]It just worked somehow.
[187:40.56]Like lightning strikes once in a million chance, right?
[187:43.29]I think Gandalf just got lucky.
[187:49.24]It's remarkable that that worked out.
[188:05.17]They even make a point to show Gandalf smoke a bunch of crack, like smoke a pipe on camera 50 times.
[188:11.17]And he sits back and his eyes roll forward and he's just like...
[188:26.78]That scared me.
[188:30.31]Yep.
[188:31.57]Everyone's like, oh, yawn, yawn.
[188:33.13]What's going on?
[188:33.57]This music sucks.
[188:34.89]Yawn.
[188:39.79]Here it comes.
[189:12.62]Alright, I think I'm gonna take this wall.
[189:14.58]Maybe not.
[189:22.04]I'm gonna play this game one day on stream.
[189:24.88]I will.
[189:25.22]I'm gonna.
[189:33.00]Paging everybody that works on the Switch N64 library.
[189:39.71]Put this on there.
[189:53.17]I don't have any more pogs left in my body to pretend to be excited about Paper Mario.
[189:58.40]I put something else on there.
[190:09.21]It's a great game.
[190:10.57]It's a great game.
[190:11.87]It is.
[190:12.17]It could be one of the greater games that was released on the console.
[190:22.18]I'm aware of that.
[190:26.36]You know what else I'm gonna wear up?
[190:27.66]Corporate greed.
[190:33.34]That's what I... Oh, I thought this was meat on here.
[190:37.43]Just... This is gonna be the concession hall.
[190:49.29]You gave into that greed.
[190:53.54]Shh, don't say that.
[191:11.08]Yeah, this is good shit.
[191:38.76]What soundtrack is this?
[191:39.52]This is Mischief Makers.
[191:43.92]Give it a listen.
[191:44.72]Go play the game if you can.
[191:48.08]Oh, this is ugly.
[191:50.59]No, get rid of that.
[191:51.43]What's down here?
[192:18.82]Why did that just make me feel so weird?
[192:21.18]Why is it in the... That was weird.
[192:24.27]I don't like that.
[192:24.97]Get rid of all this.
[192:27.07]Get this whole wall done.
[192:39.89]Get rid of the whole thing.
[193:03.59]Take this down too.
[193:04.09]Can I not?
[193:05.87]Can I go outside?
[193:07.63]Is there going to be somebody buried in the wall?
[193:21.80]Probably.
[193:22.20]I'll just peep the horror.
[193:26.56]It's here on the screen right now.
[193:42.13]All the characters in the game too, when you attack them, they go... Okay, looks good.
[193:57.32]Sell everything.
[194:10.78]Please help.
[194:11.54]What?
[194:13.68]What's wrong?
[194:14.58]Somebody said, please help.
[194:16.86]What am I helping?
[194:17.52]What happened?
[194:18.26]At least I'm making money doing this.
[194:33.07]You know, it's statistically possible that somebody may have died right now.
[194:41.02]Don't tell me that.
[194:59.51]Maybe this could be the theater.
[195:00.27]I need a big open space.
[195:13.37]This is the wall to the outside of the property.
[195:24.42]You have many viewers.
[195:27.11]Thanks.
[195:28.03]Is that a compliment or are you... What do you mean?
[195:41.86]I mean, if you want to talk about statistics, I would say if there's like a 0.0001% chance that somebody watching, you know, could fall into that category, how many people are actually going to the bathroom right now?
[196:00.03]Like they're on the toilet, and they're holding their phone in one hand.
[196:07.74]I gotta brighten this up a little bit.
[196:08.76]This is so ugly.
[196:14.92]Can't do anything with this space yet.
[196:17.56]Remind me... Oh, I could put a bathroom right here?
[196:20.70]Oh.
[196:21.56]Nope.
[196:25.12]I could.
[196:26.30]This could be the bathroom.
[196:29.14]Yeah.
[196:30.80]I think that's a good place for the restroom.
[196:38.29]It's also... I'm not going to read what you said.
[196:44.28]Because I can put them against the wall here.
[196:45.58]Alright, let's start the bathroom.
[196:51.64]I'm looking for floor.
[196:52.96]I want bathroom floor.
[196:57.74]Floor tiles.
[196:59.46]Oh.
[196:59.84]Uh, how about... Ooh, no, too much.
[197:04.74]How about these?
[197:11.36]I like it.
[197:14.01]Ooh, this is gonna be a nice bathroom.
[197:15.84]Should it be this all the way through though?
[197:37.39]What the hell is in a public bathroom?
[197:41.87]Stalls.
[197:43.87]Urinals.
[197:46.05]Sinks.
[197:53.69]Maybe I should change it out halfway through here.
[197:55.12]Okay.
[198:06.04]I need the walls to be different looking too.
[198:15.88]What should the bathroom walls look like?
[198:18.94]Let me finish this first.
[198:23.44]It's literally $50 to do this.
[198:24.72]Who cares?
[198:25.60]I can replace it if I want to.
[198:40.91]Do we have a consensus?
[198:41.65]How many are in the bathroom right now?
[198:52.82]Alright, the walls need to change.
[198:54.38]Alright, walls.
[198:58.54]I need bathroom walls.
[199:01.89]Wall tiles.
[199:05.37]Maybe some green?
[199:06.07]Some blue?
[199:09.85]Something that'll brighten up a little bit.
[199:12.27]This looks alright.
[199:18.88]Oh, what about the diamond tiles?
[199:22.07]Or these.
[199:23.49]Let me see.
[199:29.01]Let's see what they look like.
[199:29.79]I hate that.
[199:41.50]Yeah, that looks awful.
[199:43.61]Just paint it.
[199:44.03]I'm just going to paint it.
[199:58.36]Just paint.
[200:00.56]Just paint!
[200:00.92]Alright, I'm thinking we'll do crystal.
[200:05.12]See what this looks like?
[200:26.26]I need something more chill than this.
[200:27.26]This is too intense.
[200:29.06]What should I put on?
[200:32.08]There's 240 people shitting right now.
[200:40.40]That's so weird.
[200:41.84]Think about how many people 240 is.
[200:49.00]How many people can fit in a movie theater?
[200:52.70]How many seats are in like an IMAX theater?
[201:02.26]300?
[201:06.64]240.
[201:07.96]Imagine an entire IMAX theater full of people.
[201:10.74]And you know they're all going to the bathroom right now.
[201:21.87]I'm going to dress it up, don't worry.
[201:23.15]I'm just going to get this gaudy wallpaper off.
[201:29.59]I haven't peed all day either, so let's do that as well.
[201:45.53]This is not the main event.
[201:47.59]I'm just making the bathroom first so I don't forget it.
[201:49.41]Alright, I'll be right back.
[201:56.70]I'm gonna go pee.
[201:58.85]I'll be back in like 2-3 minutes.
[202:24.64]Thank you.
[203:46.30]Thank you.
[205:05.10]Thanks for watching!
[206:28.75]Thank you.
[207:03.85]Hello, I'm back.
[207:08.14]So I was just downstairs.
[207:12.22]And I was walking.
[207:15.82]And I heard a little ruffling.
[207:17.60]I heard like a little ch-ch-ch.
[207:20.27]I was like, what was that?
[207:21.97]So all of a sudden, I get this wave of baked dog cookies.
[207:29.81]Those, that savory like baked dog cookies.
[207:34.83]just filled the air I said where is he I have no idea I'm looking around I like I get I where it's like somebody lit a savory dog candle down here I don't know I can't find him I look over where he usually is I look over in the
[207:57.70]corner and on his bed no look at the couch there's nothing there there's just a really really spun up crumpled up blanket that was on the couch and I go over it and wait a minute that it's dog shaped I go over there and the way it's I'm sitting right in front of where the smell is he has wrapped himself up so much as in a blanket I can't even tell there's a dog on the couch
[208:30.32]I'm telling you, it hit me in the face when I was far away from him.
[208:38.93]He's a little dog, but he has a big dog smell.
[208:44.83]It's so cute.
[208:45.51]And then he let out this huge... Once he realized that I was in the room, he let out this just like... You know what I'm talking about, right?
[208:54.56]Yeah.
[208:59.19]He's so wonderful.
[209:01.37]Give him a bath?
[209:02.33]He gets a bath all the time.
[209:04.73]He is very thoroughly cleaned on a very regular basis.
[209:07.85]Alright, let's keep going.
[209:18.28]Can you read my disverse?
[209:22.42]What do you mean your disverse?
[209:26.58]You made a disverse?
[209:27.86]Disverse?

[209:54.79]Okay, there is.
[209:59.83]Wait, you posted it in chat.

[210:43.82]You're not a real competitor.
[210:45.24]Your flow is so slow, can't even keep tempo.
[210:47.64]But when it comes to delivering mediocre streams, you're so far on top, you're gonna get vertigo.
[210:52.65]I thought you left the React Annie stuff on YouTube.
[210:54.95]Your IQ is so high, can't solve a one-by-one Rubik's Cube.

[215:35.29]Jerma's got no rap game.
[215:36.29]His streams are lame.
[215:37.13]He smoked crack cocaine like he ain't no one to blame.
[215:39.43]Hey, I rap so fast I eat ass like groceries and Jerma985 can't even spit shit close to me.
[215:45.37]Alright.

[215:57.50]Alright, last one.
[216:06.79]Call me sanitizer because I'll wipe out the Jerma.
[216:09.99]More sterilizing than a dose of Moderna.
[216:36.47]What the fuck?
[216:51.33]The rhymes are on point here!
[216:58.02]You get to write them.
[217:00.26]I have to come up with it so much slower than you do.
[217:12.21]Do I have to do this?
[217:13.07]Hey.
[217:17.24]Listen to me.
[217:18.92]You got no job.
[217:19.96]Streaming ain't work.
[217:20.86]Your paycheck's like your hype, man.
[217:22.18]You're coming up short.
[217:23.30]Vomiting lines like they're sleaze of Oreos.
[217:25.50]Why you always single, man?
[217:26.60]Where are your hoes?
[217:27.85]You're psycho and smelly.
[217:29.01]I'll call you a rat.
[217:30.27]But never have I seen a rodent so fucking fat.
[217:47.41]That was good.
[218:02.46]Okay, one more.
[218:09.85]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, no soap, just cope.
[218:12.65]Be smelling like a fart cloud.
[218:13.95]Jerma talking with his mouth too loud.
[218:16.21]Two foot too tall and never getting higher.
[218:18.37]Vocal cords sound like a squirreling tire.
[218:33.31]When I play House Flipper, I think it gives me drugs.
[218:36.43]I don't know why.
[218:39.36]Okay, I was making a bathroom.
[218:50.13]That's the last thing I remember.
[218:59.89]Sliding in the cringe streams when vids of the year were voted on recently.
[219:05.35]I am invincible.
[219:08.72]I am unstoppable.
[219:11.04]Okay.
[219:18.46]Turn on auto-tune?
[219:19.82]Oh boy, you guys are fucking gonna derail this whole thing, aren't you?
[219:24.30]Hold on.
[219:27.36]Give me a second.
[219:35.59]Hello?
[219:36.91]Hello?
[219:37.31]Hello?
[219:40.51]Is it on?
[219:41.64]Oh, shit!
[219:42.18]It's not even on!
[219:43.32]Fuck!
[219:43.92]I didn't even turn it on!
[219:44.96]Fuck!
[219:54.92]That was really bad!
[219:56.32]I thought it was on.
[219:58.28]I thought I was safe.
[219:59.30]I thought I was so safe!
[220:01.83]Okay.
[220:03.03]Here we go.
[220:10.14]Oh, Opster has another one?
[220:11.16]Okay.
[220:15.55]This is it after this.
[220:16.77]Because I have to play the game before everybody leaves.
[220:23.07]There's like 14 of us that think this is funny.
[220:26.77]We'll stick around.
[220:27.53]Alright, here we go.
[220:29.61]Last one.
[220:40.70]It needs to be... This is going to sound so weird.
[220:44.08]Okay.
[220:53.79]How about this one?
[220:57.05]This is Opster's response.
[221:02.11]I got a new monitor, so my shit's... I can't really read it that well because everything is so small on the screen.
[221:09.72]So it's actually kind of hard for me to read it.
[221:11.20]I'm at like 144p.
[221:16.66]No, 114.40p.
[221:18.32]Oh, gee.
[221:19.70]Jerma the Wormer.
[221:20.84]Because he's slimy.
[221:22.70]He calls his crew the Boston Beatles.
[221:24.60]More like the Boston Ladybugs.
[221:26.96]My rhyme's so sweet and variable.
[221:28.92]I call it Ebola Coca-Cola.
[221:30.99]His flow's so bad, it's sleeve of Oreos.
[221:33.09]Get thrown up all over the bed.
[221:34.29]Most crude thing to come from Boston since the movie Dead.
[221:37.33]I would say worse, but I'm scared he's too hot.
[221:39.41]Would send him into his deathbed.
[221:40.79]Can't rap much longer.
[221:41.89]Ain't got the character count.
[221:43.03]But when it comes to rap battle victors, I don't think there's any doubt.
[221:50.42]oh oh oh oh oh don't do that I wonder how long would it take people to realize there was an auto tune on you think like these people coming into the stream
[222:13.54]Okay, I'm going to laugh and freak somebody out.
[222:16.68]Why does this sound so weird?
[222:18.16]Does this sound weird to you guys?
[222:28.59]Ooh, the Tasmanian.
[222:29.55]Auto-tune the Tasmanian.
[222:30.71]Oh my god.
[222:32.93]Okay, this is going to put me out.
[222:35.15]This is it.
[222:36.53]Oh, it's the Tasmanian devil time.
[222:39.22]With the fucking auto-tune on full blast.
[222:42.97]Full blast auto-tune, Tasmanian Devil.
[222:45.19]Turn your speakers down.
[222:46.28]I'm going to tell you right now.
[222:47.22]I'm going to give you a little bit of a warning here.
[222:56.98]Tasmanian Devil.
[222:58.46]I'm going for it.
[222:59.55]Here we go.
[223:01.67]Be ready.
[223:07.55]Should I do this?
[223:08.83]Okay, I'll do it.
[223:14.51]No, no, I just heard that in my head.
[223:16.66]That hurt.
[223:17.06]This is the Tasmanian devil in the electric chair, okay?
[223:31.47]This is not, doesn't sound right at all.
[223:35.71]This is like Tasmanian devil is, was tried, is on death row for like the times that he's killed like fucking 50 people with his tornado.
[223:53.15]Guilty.
[223:53.97]Flip the switch.
[224:08.48]Auto-tune.
[224:09.13]No, I have to get back to normal.
[224:12.57]I pressed it at a really bad time.
[224:23.15]It's the end of the year, man.
[224:24.05]You can't nominate this shit anymore.
[224:25.77]It's over.
[224:26.76]I can do whatever I want at this point.
[224:28.52]You understand?
[224:34.00]I'm safe.
[224:34.68]I'm free.
[224:36.00]I can do anything.
[224:40.35]It doesn't even sound any different.
[224:49.85]It actually doesn't... That doesn't sound any different.
[224:51.69]Why?
[224:54.61]Okay.
[224:57.83]That's enough.
[224:59.01]Everybody relax.
[225:01.72]We are... Holy... Wrong button.
[225:07.14]We are going back to normal here in a minute.
[225:11.30]I'm not sure if we're lost on a coin toss.
[225:14.48]I could come back then.
[225:16.66]You live in the house up back?
[225:21.05]Yes, we live in Temple, Texas.
[225:26.62]Are you married into it?
[225:27.26]Are you married into it?
[225:32.00]A little louder.
[225:34.34]Are you married into it?
[225:42.18]How much have you ever lost at a coin toss?
[225:44.12]Alright.
[225:45.06]People, I'm going to be known as the fucking guy that's on drugs every stream.
[225:48.50]And I don't even do them.
[225:49.66]So we're done after this.
[225:51.20]And how many times have I done this where I go, okay, you know, what do we do?
[225:53.86]Look at it.
[225:54.28]I can't.
[225:55.02]I have to move on.
[226:00.89]Am I just the crack guy?
[226:02.27]I mean, I might be.
[226:03.73]Should I just lean into it and just be like the crack guy?
[226:07.53]Whatever.
[226:19.00]Let me turn this off.
[226:26.78]I was doing No Country for Old Men.
[226:35.23]Remember so goofy, he looked like Ernest.
[226:37.21]Can't save Christmas by bars hot from the furnace.
[226:39.82]He really think his bar is all that, but it sounds worse than a shitting rat.
[226:43.24]His height dented, got hit with a bat.
[226:46.04]He thinks he's a lion.
[226:47.14]Nah, he's just a cat in the hat.
[226:48.88]That one, that one was, alright, I should have done that one.
[227:03.87]Do it as Saw?
[227:10.90]Alright, if you give me a good one, I need a good one to do as Jigsaw.
[227:17.28]And make it Jigsaw themed.

[231:57.35]It really does feel like that, doesn't it?
[232:02.66]Get Freddy to write something?
[232:08.88]If Freddy writes me a Saw rap, I will do it.
[232:14.08]I will do it in the Saw voice.
[232:19.38]No pressure on Freddy, by the way.
[232:21.06]Freddy, if you're like, no, I don't want to fucking do that.
[232:23.54]Freddy, you write like a saw rap, I'll do it.
[232:27.63]And I will release it on stream.
[232:34.11]You just ruined Freddy's DMs.
[232:37.38]No, turn off your DMs, Freddy.
[232:39.94]Freddy, go private for like a week, and then we'll talk.
[232:59.70]Post it to the main channel.
[233:01.03]No, nothing's going to the main channel ever again.
[233:13.20]It has to be a music video.
[233:16.10]No, I can't do a music video.
[233:19.46]January and February is going to be so busy.
[233:22.43]I can't.
[233:36.31]This is awful.
[233:43.03]Okay.
[233:45.31]I gotta turn the volume back up and we have to put on just some music.
[233:48.80]Just regular, just kind of hangout music.
[233:50.76]No more freestyles.
[233:58.08]Okay, I'm gonna put on like Animal Crossing...
[234:01.54]New Leaf OST.
[234:03.32]We've got to come down from that.
[234:04.60]That was too much.
[234:05.45]We've got to relax.
[234:16.21]Held for auto-mod for bullying.
[234:18.29]That's the... Oh yeah, send me your diss tracks.
[234:22.09]Excuse me, don't bully the streamer.
[234:24.77]That's so funny.
[234:28.14]Well, at least I know it works.
[234:49.91]I'm not gonna put the music on x2 speed.
[234:54.65]Just, okay, here's what you can do.
[234:57.09]Wait 20 minutes, go open up the VOD, and then watch this part in x2 speed.
[235:16.64]You need to talk in half speed to match.
[235:19.48]Oh come on, don't give me more stupid routines to do!
[235:23.96]Now I have to do this!
[235:32.38]So I was thinking of putting white up on the background here.
[235:39.01]And you guys tell me if you think it's a good enough color.
[235:49.11]I think it's gonna look really nice Maybe eventually we can put some paintings up on the walls I think that will come out good
[236:13.14]Upstairs, however, I think we have to do something a little more elaborate Maybe a couple of chairs here on either side
[236:37.22]But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here?
[236:44.42]Oh, this is not the chairs.
[236:56.53]It's the paint menu.
[237:09.63]I think it's over here somewhere Let me search for it C H A I R
[237:31.77]That's what I was saying to you earlier.
[237:35.91]This one with the green.
[237:41.48]That's gonna look so good here.
[237:50.24]Okay... I think I have enough chairs there.
[238:21.45]Hey, does anybody see the new Marvel movie?
[238:26.91]Is it any good?
[238:33.69]oh wait I think somebody's texting me feel a sneeze coming on
[239:07.36]Okay.
[239:08.52]Alright, alright.
[239:09.16]I need it clipped.
[239:09.82]Give it to me.
[239:11.44]Can somebody do that at, uh, get that at times two?
[239:13.72]And I need to watch that right now.
[239:16.09]I wanna see how close I was.
[239:17.05]I think I was pretty close.
[239:22.09]Can we get that section, that like two minute section there to see if it was like a full minute of me, of normal shit?
[239:33.94]You're a psycho.
[239:34.82]That's fine.
[239:36.44]You got the whole thing?
[239:38.40]Can I do this in times two?
[239:39.30]Oh, good.
[239:44.36]Okay, speed times two.
[239:48.04]Upstairs, however, I... Oh, my God.
[239:51.78]I think it works.
[239:53.28]I think it works.
[239:58.98]Hold on.
[239:59.58]We got to confirm that this works.
[240:09.75]Alright, it's time.
[240:11.57]I think I did a pretty good job.
[240:13.39]That will... Okay, let's see how I did.
[240:26.09]That will come out good.
[240:29.12]Upstairs, however, I think we have to do something a little more elaborate.
[240:35.36]Maybe a couple of chairs here on either side.
[240:41.13]But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here?
[240:48.04]This is not the chairs.
[240:50.80]It's the paint menu I think it needs to be a little faster.
[241:00.52]I think it needs to be like two and a half or three I need to see it at three It sounds like an AI generated voice
[241:12.06]I need to see this at 3.
[241:13.82]Upstairs, however I... Alright, somebody clip this.
[241:17.28]No, no, no.
[241:17.60]I need the whole thing.
[241:19.62]I need the whole thing.
[241:20.43]I need it at times 3.
[241:30.43]Wait, hold on.
[241:31.05]It's too long?
[241:38.61]Clip this one and just do... Alright, alright.
[241:40.81]Did you get that?
[241:41.71]Give it to me.
[241:43.38]Give me what just happened right there.
[241:44.68]And I'm going to do times one.
[241:52.18]Make this... Okay, here we go.
[241:54.52]Let me open this one.
[241:55.78]Because this would be times two.
[241:57.28]There's here on either side.
[241:59.58]Okay, so now let's do times two on this one.
[242:05.72]Chairs here on either side.
[242:06.94]Oh my god, this is fucked.
[242:09.02]Okay, this is perfect.
[242:11.44]I eventually want this whole thing.
[242:17.73]This is now times four.
[242:25.19]That will come out.
[242:30.42]Chairs here.
[242:32.92]Oh my god, dude, are you kidding me?
[242:34.62]Okay.
[242:35.24]Times two.
[242:37.74]Chairs here on either side.
[242:47.13]Chairs here on either side.
[242:49.23]But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here?
[242:51.69]Oh, this is not the chairs.
[242:54.06]It's the paint menu.
[242:55.06]Okay, that's a little too fast.
[242:58.94]A little bit.
[242:59.54]It needs to be 1.5.
[243:03.31]Chairs here on either side.
[243:06.01]But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here?
[243:09.31]Oh, this is not the chairs.
[243:12.47]It's the paint menu.
[243:16.17]That will come out good.
[243:18.03]I think it needs to be a little faster.
[243:18.97]What?
[243:19.29]I think it needs to be like two and a half or three.
[243:21.60]I'm too fast.
[243:22.00]I need to see the three.
[243:23.94]Wait, AI generated voice?
[243:29.60]I want to see the whole thing.
[243:31.48]It's alright.
[243:35.82]See it at 3?
[243:36.22]That's so stupid.
[243:43.51]Somebody, alright.
[243:44.85]Somebody download the f- I don't know.
[243:55.23]It's time to do it in the reverse.
[243:56.05]Here we go.
[243:56.41]What do you think?
[244:02.05]I think over here.
[244:03.44]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[244:04.38]Right here, right here, here, here, here.
[244:06.65]What should I do?
[244:08.05]Should I do blue?
[244:09.03]Should I do this blue?
[244:10.07]This blue right here.
[244:10.87]Good?
[244:11.13]Yep.
[244:13.25]That's not gonna work.
[244:14.29]It's too hard to go fast.
[244:29.30]Speed this one up?
[244:35.21]Chairs here on either side.
[244:36.43]Oh.
[244:38.47]This is not the chairs.
[244:41.27]That was so fucked up.
[244:45.41]Somebody said Vocaloid.
[244:46.55]Alright.
[244:52.07]No more derailing.
[244:53.17]It's time to play.
[244:59.47]Alright, somebody, I know somebody, on the subreddit, in like an hour, will have that whole section sped up to the exact preferences that need to be to make it sound normal.
[245:10.64]And then you'll see it there later in like an hour.
[245:15.27]I'm looking forward to it.
[245:22.35]Alright, I just- I was down doing the bathroom.
[245:24.29]I don't even know where the bathroom is.
[245:25.31]It was like underground somewhere.
[245:27.49]Oh, right, okay.
[245:29.07]These are not the chairs.
[245:39.53]So I'm thinking... What the hell do I even do with this place?
[245:48.15]I was gonna make a theater, but it's- the castle's like too big and weird.
[246:01.91]There's too... It's like there's too many outdoor areas.
[246:03.65]You know what I mean?
[246:15.15]Is this a queen?
[246:15.63]Oh, okay.
[246:20.91]Just make a counter-strike map.
[246:23.34]I made the FPS house already.
[246:38.79]I know, this dude's actually playing the game.
[246:40.23]I know what happened.
[246:46.16]It's a user-made sawdust.
[246:48.14]Alright, this is too much.
[246:59.61]I'll do this later.
[247:02.20]Go back to the funny stuff.
[247:03.58]No more playing games.
[247:04.96]No, we can't just all be cartoon world.
[247:26.45]Oh, music though.
[247:27.27]Yeah, let's put Animal Crossing back on.
[247:30.54]So now what I was thinking was singing you a little song.
[247:42.02]Happy birthday to you.
[247:48.11]I'm done.
[247:48.93]I'm kidding.
[247:50.17]I'm kidding.
[247:50.71]Relax.
[248:04.42]I don't like this place.
[248:05.22]Yeah, I don't like this house.
[248:10.30]I want another one.
[248:20.22]What?
[248:20.42]Here we go.
[248:29.20]Here we go.
[248:41.81]Okay, I got my money back.
[248:42.79]Yeah, I don't like that place.
[248:45.03]What do you mean, find?
[248:48.97]No, accept the offer.
[248:49.75]Okay, find.
[248:57.55]Ooh.
[249:01.19]Ah.
[249:04.69]Ooh.
[249:08.22]In this dream suit, my family's making Christmas cookies.
[249:10.16]We'll go for like another hour or two.
[249:14.40]I'll be laughing a day or two anyways.
[249:15.46]I'll be laughing on Christmas Eve.
[249:17.65]But no, I'm not done.
[249:18.63]I want a different house.
[249:25.03]I don't like that one.
[249:42.58]Should I just say fuck it and buy the dumb boat?
[249:45.70]What can I even do with it though?
[249:52.85]I feel like I... This might be just like the castle though.
[250:01.03]No, we already did the boat.
[250:08.84]This one was kind of cool.
[250:11.62]Yeah, I'm going to buy this one.
[250:12.58]I did the moon house last time.
[250:22.81]Just make a big bird house.
[250:27.89]I did the moon one last time.
[250:32.55]Alright, now I'm going to go for it.
[250:42.24]Actually going to play.
[250:51.13]I'm going to do a regular house with a theater in the middle.
[250:58.41]Or maybe I'll just mow the lawn and then do a rap battle with the chat.
[251:04.86]I don't know.
[251:05.96]We'll find out.
[251:18.31]This is a nice house though, I could decorate this.
[251:33.14]Recreate your own house.
[251:47.15]I have a verse I want you to rap.
[251:48.49]I'm not doing anymore raps.
[251:55.23]Destroy your own house with a sledgehammer.
[251:56.97]Alright, this is mowing speed, so I think this one's good.
[252:07.90]Am I going faster?
[252:30.80]Make a studio in the house and then just do rap battles in the house.
[252:42.30]What the hell are you doing?
[252:42.98]Alright, whatever.
[252:44.60]Let's clean up.
[252:49.16]I'm gonna go room by room.
[252:54.71]One by one.
[253:01.94]Just make a normal, nice house.
[253:04.37]Should I actually try to show you guys what I think is a nice house?
[253:07.91]What I think would be good instead of making malls, comedy theaters, ice cream shops, Best Buys, golf courses.
[253:15.95]Should I actually try to do a decent house for once in the three plus years I've been playing this fucking game?
[253:26.36]Let's see what I can do.
[253:39.59]That's on the ground.
[253:40.27]Where is this shit?
[253:46.75]Oh, it's glass, gosh.
[253:47.65]Alright, this is the garage.
[253:58.42]Alright, let's settle down.
[254:00.26]Let's relax.
[254:02.80]Time for the chill section of the stream here.
[254:05.15]Just relax with me.
[254:06.71]Take a deep breath.
[254:12.27]See?
[254:13.69]Don't you feel better?
[254:28.08]What's going on with the ground?
[254:36.97]What happened?
[254:47.40]You're in a really silly mood.
[254:48.68]I think that once every 6 to 12 months or so... I let the goblin out.
[254:59.31]And it just happens to coincide with House Flipper updates.
[255:17.22]Now, get rid of all this.
[255:19.64]Now.
[255:22.36]Okay.
[255:23.24]I like this kitchen.
[255:24.36]It could use a little bit of work.
[255:40.51]Change these windows out.
[255:45.57]Don't let the goblin out.
[255:51.25]I will if I want to.
[255:56.09]These are broken.
[255:57.01]I need to redo this.
[255:59.95]What the fuck?
[256:00.87]Oh, right.
[256:01.31]Okay, wait.
[256:01.93]Okay.
[256:02.55]What?
[256:07.31]Oh, TV is going there.
[256:08.39]So if this was my house.
[256:11.22]Alright.
[256:12.10]Open the door.
[256:12.68]I placed my keys right here.
[256:16.90]What are my favorite colors that I want for house?
[256:32.11]I got a spray.
[256:37.33]Still dirty?
[256:37.73]Get out of here.
[256:40.35]What are you talking about?
[256:43.49]What are you talking about?
[256:44.38]Oh, I got it.
[256:52.88]There we go.
[256:57.05]Where is this other dirt?
[256:58.27]I don't see it on the ground.
[257:09.65]Where is it?
[257:14.60]Oh, whatever.
[257:28.54]Fuse?
[257:32.08]Oh, broken fuse.
[257:33.20]Alright.
[257:35.14]It's kind of dirty.
[257:37.57]Can I clean this?
[257:45.86]Oh, it's the side entrance.
[257:46.82]Okay.

[258:44.44]I did not know they made a movie.
[258:54.39]The sink has got to go.
[258:55.79]A lot of this stuff has got to go.
[259:00.99]This bathroom needs work.
[259:05.31]Is there a second floor?
[259:19.36]A little bit of dirt left to get.
[259:24.44]Should be good though.
[259:27.98]Very cool.
[259:31.55]They take Santa to court.
[259:35.11]Sounds like a wild movie.
[259:37.97]Too scary for me.
[259:39.17]That's too scary for me.
[259:51.58]Alright, I like this upstairs.
[259:57.93]You gotta clean first.
[259:58.99]That's the most important thing.
[260:06.84]Then you just go one by one, room by room.
[260:10.67]And make your dream house.

[261:53.97]I uninstalled it.
[261:55.23]I got to S rank and I raged.
[261:58.61]I threw my controller through the window.
[262:01.32]It exploded.
[262:02.18]It was embarrassing and shitty.
[262:09.76]Well, I can't get back in the house.
[262:22.46]More dirt.
[262:23.34]There's something here.
[262:26.96]Come on, get that balcony.
[262:36.98]Really?
[262:47.50]Looks better.
[262:56.84]Where is it?
[262:59.51]It's not even on the map.
[263:11.63]This house is modernist trash.
[263:21.96]Modernist trash?
[263:29.52]Modernist fucking sucks.
[263:31.44]I did not know you guys were this into home design.
[263:49.78]good okay there's only one more room that I really need to clean this dirty one okay nice almost time to redecorate
[264:14.45]Chat sees the new Pringles logo and thinks all modernist art sucks.
[264:18.26]What's the new Pringles logo?
[264:19.70]What do you mean?
[264:20.10]What do they do?
[264:31.63]Looks like an iPad game.
[264:50.84]Um... I... I mean... Is this the new can?
[264:58.08]They took... They removed his hair.
[265:03.16]I didn't even know he had hair.
[265:08.16]Hold on.
[265:12.39]Wait, I didn't... He has hair?
[265:27.56]He does have hair.
[265:28.22]Alright.
[265:36.81]This looks like the episode of the Pringles TV show where he goes back to like the 30s and it's black and white.
[265:53.84]I mean, who cares?
[265:54.74]Does anybody care?
[265:58.88]You want my reaction?
[265:59.95]Who cares?
[266:02.49]When they change the recipe of Pringles, that's when you'll hear me scream.
[266:12.43]They could put clown makeup on him and give him a big chef's hat.
[266:15.44]Whatever.
[266:15.72]Do they taste the same?
[266:24.62]I'm just not looking forward to if they ever make the Pringles guy a real guy in the commercials.
[266:29.92]Be like interesting and funny and shit, and it's like a- it's just a guy.
[266:33.11]Okay, I think everything's clean.
[266:48.38]I'm gonna go to the living room.
[266:49.14]I'm gonna start living room.
[266:52.79]Let's change the stairs to something that is way more tolerable than this.
[266:56.04]Alright, I like a... I... I'm not a big wood guy.
[267:05.98]I would ruin it.
[267:06.66]I think it can be destroyed too easily.
[267:10.20]I'm like a vinyl, linoleum, tile... You can just... Wood is expensive and you can fuck it up really easily.
[267:31.18]I don't hate the mahogany I don't hate the mahogany I don't like Darkwood actually that's not true I like um
[267:53.82]I don't like that.
[267:55.20]Where's the- Where's- Where's just like the reg- Alright.
[267:57.76]That doesn't look bad.
[268:01.24]This doesn't look bad either.
[268:02.32]This doesn't look bad.
[268:03.00]I'm going with the mahogany.
[268:03.97]I think it looks good.
[268:11.33]Living room time.
[268:12.27]What do I want my- First of all, I gotta get these walls taken care of because oh my goodness.
[268:18.53]Guys.
[268:20.83]What the heck's going on here?
[268:23.16]Paint.
[268:24.72]I like very neutral colors in my living spaces.
[268:29.02]I'm talking grays.
[268:30.46]I'm talking kind of like olive.
[268:35.48]Off-white.
[268:36.46]Not ever cigarette yellow, though.
[268:39.92]I don't like a cream yellow.
[268:41.38]I think it looks like cigarettes.
[268:42.92]Like this.
[268:43.58]No.
[268:44.09]Cigarettes.
[268:47.39]Steel gray.
[268:48.75]I would like on the wall, probably.
[268:50.21]Let me see what it looks like.
[268:59.30]I like a neutral living room.
[269:03.47]Although, there could be an accent.
[269:04.75]I have an orange couch.
[269:15.78]No.
[269:16.10]No.
[269:17.76]No.
[269:18.06]This is too neutral.
[269:24.62]Let me just see what it looks like.
[269:36.69]And maybe like a blue?
[269:37.39]I love navy.
[269:38.49]I really like nautical colors.
[269:41.35]I like blue, white, navy.
[269:47.07]Is this too dark?
[269:54.05]Excuse me?
[270:02.82]Blue is a nice color.
[270:03.60]Yeah, I'm going to have... Look, I have a navy wall here.
[270:05.75]Let's try it.
[270:13.15]Nautical.
[270:13.79]No, nonsense.
[270:14.85]Do something else.
[270:26.77]Recommend dark green.
[270:28.53]That's not a bad one either.
[270:29.89]That's a good one.
[270:33.39]Let me check this first, though.
[270:36.81]Okay.
[270:40.69]No, red's too bold.
[270:43.06]Royal blue is, I think, too... I'm thinking, like, a navy blue.
[270:46.72]Ooh, gray fog.
[270:50.28]Moody cobalt.
[270:51.28]Yep.
[270:54.31]This might be the one.
[271:06.97]Live a little.
[271:18.63]I love blue.
[271:19.79]I really like blue a lot.
[271:25.05]Now the question is, should I just have that be blue?
[271:27.53]I think so.
[271:41.63]Okay.
[271:43.03]Yeah, what's wrong with this?
[271:44.19]Look at this.
[271:44.53]This is comfortable.
[271:48.67]You're making a restaurant.
[271:53.45]Try beige.
[271:54.17]I'll give it a tester.
[272:05.24]White wall.
[272:05.88]These are not white walls.
[272:07.50]These are... I don't remember.
[272:09.52]It's some kind of gray.
[272:10.32]Okay.
[272:13.25]I need to get my lighting in here.
[272:14.37]Does your dream house not chats do what you want?
[272:32.14]Yeah.
[272:37.76]You want... You want bright orange walls?
[272:42.39]Oh, just get the game.
[272:43.55]Why do you not have this game in the first place?
[272:46.07]This game is the most chill game ever that's ever existed.
[272:56.14]Oh, it's light.
[273:01.20]I think it's on.
[273:01.74]Wait, is it on sale?
[273:11.72]It doesn't run on your operating system.
[273:13.82]It doesn't?
[273:14.24]What?
[273:17.62]How much is it?
[273:18.08]I don't know.

[274:01.24]I don't know if I want to do white over here.
[274:07.11]It's too plain on the sides here.
[274:11.65]Maybe something else here.
[274:12.43]What do you think?
[274:20.18]Oh, maybe pistachio green?
[274:24.96]Hmm.

[278:54.59]I don't like stuff like this.
[278:56.01]Too old.
[278:56.51]I don't hate this, but I don't really like the wood.
[279:03.13]All this is too extra for me.
[279:05.37]Too extra.
[279:06.71]Way too extra.
[279:09.79]Okay.
[279:11.43]Not bad.
[279:13.49]Too artsy.
[279:16.35]I feel like I have something to prove if I have this.
[279:22.57]Too boring.
[279:25.15]Too generic.
[279:28.83]Too streamer.
[279:33.36]Maybe.
[279:33.98]No.
[279:36.88]No, too old.
[279:39.00]Ugly.
[279:41.52]No.
[279:43.36]Ugly.
[279:44.84]Okay.

[279:49.44]Armin!
[279:50.08]Armin!
[279:55.10]Um... Nah, I don't want it.
[280:01.11]Way too futuristic, extra weird shit.
[280:06.85]Too campy.
[280:09.93]Too fake sci-fi.
[280:13.49]Too fake old sci-fi.
[280:19.75]Wedding.
[280:20.33]No.
[280:25.36]There it is.
[280:26.32]There it is.
[280:31.18]Finally.
[280:32.06]The shit that I think actually looks alright.
[280:34.62]We made it.
[280:35.00]I like that.
[280:39.88]I don't like that.
[280:42.62]Ceiling fans.
[280:43.24]I don't hate that.
[280:54.99]Yeah.
[280:57.41]Just do candles.
[280:58.17]Alright.
[280:58.95]I'm going to let's go with this.
[281:12.36]Here.
[281:12.88]I like the gray.
[281:13.48]I like the gray.
[281:19.24]This is going to go right right there.
[281:27.55]Oh, look at that.
[281:31.63]Wow.
[281:34.61]I like that where it is.
[281:37.85]I might move it.
[281:38.97]Let's see.
[281:39.57]Ooh.
[281:40.39]I like this too.
[281:41.85]Gold?
[281:42.11]Nah.
[281:42.35]Light.
[281:43.13]Does this work?
[282:10.99]Alright, now we're talking.
[282:22.35]Now we need... I need to get a couple more lamps.
[282:31.15]Yuck.
[282:32.93]I hate, um, ceiling fans.
[282:35.95]You know why I hate ceiling fans?
[282:37.03]Because most people that have a ceiling fan...
[282:40.15]I mean, a lot of people have it fine.
[282:43.00]But when a ceiling fan is not mounted completely correctly, and it's not maybe screwed in all the way on one side, when they have that weird wobble, it just induces anxiety in my brain.
[282:56.76]I hate it.
[282:59.30]If it's not perfect, and I don't like when a ceiling fan spins a lot.
[283:05.75]Something about it freaks me out.
[283:07.74]Especially if you have a ceiling fan and you're like, oh yeah, turn the ceiling fan on.
[283:11.92]And this thing is a blender sitting above us on the couch.
[283:15.58]I don't know.
[283:15.96]I just feel like, dude, if that thing ever falls, we're just literally going to get chopped up like a fucking helicopter in GTA.
[283:24.34]Especially when they're on high.
[283:27.29]You look up and you just see this helicopter blade just spinning.
[283:38.62]I don't like it.
[283:40.18]Mounted on the wall like a normal person.
[283:50.07]And not sharp.
[283:53.19]It's something about how fast it moves.
[283:56.31]I don't like fast things.
[283:59.06]Let me name you some things that I don't like.
[284:01.18]I don't like when a car goes fast.
[284:05.01]Speeding and shit, I really don't like it.
[284:09.07]Anything that goes fast.
[284:17.31]Like, more than 70, 80 miles per hour is like, no, no, no, no, I don't like when cars go fast.
[284:26.34]I don't like when things spin really fast.
[284:36.06]You laugh at car accidents in video games.
[284:45.39]Scared of ovens, cars, and fans.
[284:50.39]I don't like snakes.
[284:52.79]I love snake theoretically on paper as an animal.
[284:56.37]But I don't like how fast they are.
[284:58.56]If they want to just be like... They can just go... I don't know, they move too fast.
[285:05.50]Spiders that can like sprint I just don't like when things move fast You have balloons they fill up boom real fast air shoots out bomb like bomb explodes.
[285:19.48]I don't like it.
[285:19.90]I hate it Okay, let me what was I doing?
[285:28.31]Yeah, I need the uh, I want the recessed lights
[285:46.91]Anything with a lot of tension or that moves really fast, I do not like.
[285:52.56]How's this one?
[285:56.62]Is that alright?
[286:00.70]I'm going to move these because I want to know what... I'm going to make sure I know where the couch is.
[286:04.04]You know what I'm saying?
[286:10.52]These things suck.
[286:15.14]Someone just, like, poked a hole in my ceiling.
[286:22.07]You are a prey animal.
[286:32.00]That's so funny.
[286:38.30]Uh...
[286:42.28]Oh, everybody's a lion, right?
[286:46.98]Oh, I'm a lion.
[286:48.10]I'm a tiger.
[286:48.98]I'm a wolf.
[286:50.06]No, you're not.
[287:05.99]You're a horse?
[287:06.43]No, you're not.
[287:11.25]70% of the people in this chat are frogs, bugs, small animals, like mice, rats, goldfish, fucking aardvarks, monkeys,
[287:43.00]You're a bunny.
[287:44.30]Yeah, bunnies.
[287:54.52]This stream is all over the place.
[288:00.82]Should we tell him?
[288:02.68]Bear?
[288:03.08]Nope.
[288:03.86]Actually, you know what?
[288:04.70]I actually feel like Lottie probably could be a bear.
[288:07.68]Like a grizzly bear.
[288:11.73]You're not, none of you are lions.
[288:14.59]Lion's the guy with the fucking ear pods on.
[288:17.11]Just blasting music in the gym.
[288:18.83]Like, you're not, none of, we're not lions here.
[288:39.99]Lizards, yup.
[288:40.69]Oh yeah, there's probably a lot of lizards here.
[288:42.09]Probably a lot of snakes.
[288:49.13]What's it looking up?
[288:49.65]Oh yeah, lights.
[288:53.31]I think some of you probably are lions.
[288:54.95]Some of you are probably tigers.
[288:55.87]I think it's way more hyenas here than anything else.
[289:07.17]Alright, why am I under doors?
[289:10.67]Lights.
[289:11.23]Okay, please.
[289:12.17]Ceiling.
[289:15.25]There we go.
[289:15.83]I just want it to be... I don't want anything fancy.
[289:19.33]Swanky!
[289:42.59]Ooh, look at that.
[289:45.64]Most of you are sheep.
[289:48.20]No, I don't believe that.
[289:54.00]I actually think there are probably more anteaters here than sheep.
[289:58.85]I really believe, I think so.
[290:03.19]Let's get some furniture.
[290:05.43]Ouch.
[290:08.99]No, no.
[290:11.42]No.
[290:12.30]No.
[290:14.00]Too, too brick.
[290:15.78]I just think of brick.
[290:16.30]This looks like it hurts to sit on.
[290:17.94]This looks like a coffin.
[290:20.56]This is a coffin.
[290:24.64]No.
[290:29.53]No.
[290:29.71]I like this one because it has like audio.
[290:39.62]Is that all the couches there are?
[290:40.46]No, there's a million.
[290:42.24]Furniture.
[290:44.27]Living room.
[290:46.39]Sofa.
[290:47.05]Okay.
[290:49.01]I like that one.
[290:52.17]I like this one.
[291:00.31]They're okay.
[291:01.44]This is okay too.
[291:03.98]I actually kind of like this.
[291:04.98]Even though it's kind of weird.
[291:12.12]This one looks like a musical instrument.
[291:17.44]Too elaborate.
[291:21.08]Too many holes.
[291:21.54]Too big.
[291:30.52]Too fancy.
[291:33.28]Weird.
[291:33.60]Daybed.
[291:35.42]What was that other one?
[291:41.72]Kind of liked it.
[291:44.04]I like this one.
[291:44.94]I like it.
[291:45.22]It's kind of weird.
[291:49.02]A big corner.
[291:49.66]Alright, what color do I want?
[291:53.91]Looks comfy.
[291:57.21]I like black couch.
[291:58.81]Or a darker couch.
[292:10.04]Ooh, now that's...
[292:11.57]Fancy.
[292:15.29]Ooh, that's good too.
[292:16.59]No, we're going with that one.
[292:21.99]Hmm.
[292:34.66]Hmm.
[292:37.86]Hmm.
[292:49.92]I want to move the window, but I don't think I can.
[292:51.86]I don't want the TV to be here.
[293:00.09]No, let's put... You know what?
[293:01.61]No, I like a TV on the wall.
[293:06.33]The couch kind of needs to be here, though.
[293:07.83]I don't like the setup.
[293:20.93]That's better.
[293:23.33]And then I'm sealing this and putting the TV here.
[293:25.95]And you can't fucking stop me.
[293:29.14]No one's gonna say anything to stop me from doing this.
[293:32.00]No, but you're... Oh, no, don't close that off.
[293:33.88]Nope.
[293:34.34]Nothing you can say that's gonna change my mind.
[293:36.94]But what do you think?
[293:37.62]Do you think it's okay?
[293:41.74]Do you think it would look okay?
[293:43.77]I value your opinion.
[293:44.77]Very much so.
[294:05.54]Alright.
[294:08.84]Where's the bathroom gonna go?
[294:11.70]Bathroom?
[294:12.06]Wait, what's over here?
[294:12.78]So this is the garage.
[294:16.01]No, what is this?
[294:16.75]I don't like that.
[294:20.69]I don't like that.
[294:24.25]Where's that?
[294:24.71]Where'd he put the car?
[294:26.43]Why is that there?
[294:27.03]Does it have a garage?
[294:33.23]Where's the front of the house?
[294:34.33]I can't even find the front of the house.
[294:43.06]Where am I?
[294:43.58]Okay.
[294:46.00]This is the garage.
[294:47.08]Alright, so it's not enclosed.
[294:49.86]You pull the car up here.
[294:51.98]And you can get out.
[294:54.04]This is the front door.
[294:55.53]Where you get out and here is where you go in through the garage.
[295:04.36]But I say... Okay.
[295:12.61]So this is the bathroom.
[295:16.77]Shit.
[295:21.73]I want this to be the bathroom.
[295:22.68]Does it have a huge bathroom?
[295:35.68]Yeah.
[295:42.22]What else?
[295:42.62]I don't want anything else down here.
[295:43.72]Oh, shit.

[295:57.73]Yeah, the kitchen will go... Okay.
[296:02.57]Okay.
[296:06.93]Oh shit, I'm supposed to watch TV on this wall.
[296:10.33]Oh well.
[296:31.68]This house sucks.
[296:33.70]For putting a TV anywhere.
[296:37.14]The couch almost does it this house sucks It's got a couch has got to go this way then TV's got to go on this wall couch.
[296:47.83]Yeah.
[296:48.49]Oh fine.
[296:49.75]I'll get rid of my dream couch Unless I want to do this cuz that's weird Is it weird though?
[297:14.41]I gotta open this up and see what this looks like.
[297:26.56]This has to be the bathroom.
[297:30.16]This could be the kitchen, and this could be the bathroom.
[297:34.22]You understand?
[297:34.64]Because the kitchen, I feel like, needs to be here.
[297:57.33]Because this will be the kitchen.
[297:59.17]So you'll walk in.
[298:00.09]And here's the little area where you put your keys or whatever.
[298:03.78]And then... Oh, the kitchen.
[298:05.28]Yeah, you can put the groceries in the garage.
[298:26.90]Combine the kitchen and the bathroom.
[298:28.32]There's no privacy.
[298:28.98]Okay, that looks good.
[298:39.11]Yeah, because then I'll close this.
[298:40.47]I'll close... No, I won't.
[299:01.20]How come there are no walls?
[299:03.02]I just need to open it up and see how much space I actually have.
[299:05.50]Yeah, where's the load-bearing wall?
[299:12.53]There isn't one, apparently.
[299:13.63]There's nothing keeping this house up.
[299:31.84]Okay.
[299:33.94]So if I walk in the front door, I got nice.
[299:36.76]Living room.
[299:37.92]Couch.

[301:12.16]Can I do black?
[301:31.76]This house sucks.
[301:33.74]What shitty wall placement?
[301:37.71]Because I feel like this needs to be like here.
[301:40.15]This couch is too big.
[301:42.81]It is too big.
[301:50.61]One of these will do.
[301:51.79]I'll just go with one of the ones I was going to get up here.
[301:55.03]This one here.
[301:59.36]I like that.
[301:59.78]This is where we go with a little bit of blue and orange maybe.

[302:08.90]And.
[302:23.77]Alright.
[302:24.27]Against the wall.

[302:46.12]I want something else.
[302:54.04]Everyone's got a pretty good view of the TV.

[303:38.74]It's working.
[303:39.50]I'm like falling asleep here.
[303:43.73]I actually just did a big yawn.
[303:51.22]I'll stick with it.
[303:51.72]It's fine.
[303:52.00]I don't like the color.
[303:53.26]Something darker.
[304:07.20]Not bad.
[304:07.50]Are you gonna fall asleep on stream?
[304:09.80]Alright, I need a... Ooh.

[306:09.73]You know, screw that.
[306:11.93]I'll put up a lamp and a plant and a decoration.
[306:14.21]You can't even use it.
[306:15.21]Not even worth it.
[306:16.07]I want like four sodas here.
[306:23.33]Those tables are too big.

[309:28.30]Forest animals?
[309:35.67]Like that?
[309:40.13]Yeah, I'll change the pillow.
[309:41.19]Ooh, yeah.
[309:42.29]Ooh, yeah.
[309:46.99]Aye, yep.
[309:57.15]Can I edit this?
[310:07.71]It does kind of look like a mouse pad, you're right.
[310:10.52]How do I edit this couch?
[310:31.52]Couch.
[310:37.93]I need that kind of teal white.
[310:42.58]Green, maybe.
[310:43.58]Green!
[310:46.10]Or is this up here?
[310:47.96]There it is.
[310:49.04]Alright, I want... It looks so cool.
[310:55.60]Is this one here?
[310:57.76]Secondary color.
[311:01.81]Green.
[311:08.12]How does that look?
[311:11.04]I wonder.
[311:26.99]It's too big.
[311:28.57]How can I put it here?
[311:38.59]What's going on?
[311:39.05]What's happening?
[311:47.62]The wrong couch?
[311:48.42]Oh.
[311:48.60]Is it this one?
[311:50.80]What couch was it?
[312:22.05]That's cute.
[312:25.65]Need to move it a little bit though.
[312:34.40]That's Tsune Miku!
[312:39.79]I'm a big fan.
[312:45.72]This thing is dog shit.
[312:47.98]It's gotta go.
[312:48.96]I gotta do something later.
[312:55.98]I got it.
[312:56.32]I got it.
[313:04.28]No, I thought this was gonna be bigger.
[313:13.05]Did they put Miku dolls all over the place?
[313:23.31]What the fuck?
[313:24.45]Why are they so small?
[313:41.83]Okay, I'm sorry.
[313:43.54]Should I keep it?
[313:55.52]That looks so bad.
[314:00.20]I'll fix it later.
[314:00.90]In the meantime, I just have to get something in here to have it not be look terrible.
[314:12.29]If this is gonna be the kitchen, then that means the bathroom has to move, so let's get rid of all this crap.
[314:26.28]I can sell the- wait, I thought the windows were permanent.
[314:31.30]Did they change that?
[314:32.70]That must have been an update.
[314:33.40]Oh.
[314:40.07]You could not touch the windows before.
[314:42.02]I guess you can now.
[314:46.74]Interesting, okay.
[314:54.91]Well, that changes a lot then.
[315:00.81]So I want this to be the kitchen.
[315:02.73]So you walk in.
[315:05.01]Bang, kitchen.
[315:07.90]Bridge is going to be... Get rid of these windows.
[315:13.64]Put them in later.
[315:15.96]I have to get my furniture in first before the window's gone.
[315:28.59]So... Kitchen here.
[315:31.05]That means I need... What do I need?
[315:33.56]I need to get the... Ground.
[315:35.58]Ground.
[315:37.70]Nice kitchen floor, I would say, would be linoleum.
[315:41.48]Vinyl.
[315:43.46]I'm big into vinyl in kitchens.
[315:49.25]You could dump a whole glass of wine on the ground in vinyl and just get it up easily.
[315:57.43]Alright.
[316:01.33]No.
[316:04.06]What do I get?
[316:05.98]Messeries?
[316:06.48]No.
[316:07.02]Furniture.
[316:08.84]What is it under?
[316:09.64]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[316:12.30]What do I want on the floor?
[316:14.80]Floor.
[316:22.21]Natural stone.
[316:23.11]That sounds kind of cool.
[316:23.89]What does it look like?
[316:48.60]Not very good.
[316:53.06]Okay, what about... Cream tiles?
[316:58.69]I don't hate cream tiles in a kitchen.
[317:16.12]Too bright?
[317:17.97]I think it looks okay.
[317:25.35]Ooh, what's this?
[317:38.74]Yeah, I think we're talking.
[317:41.98]I think we're talking.
[317:45.01]Now we need a... I need to put a wall up now.
[317:47.44]Because the bathroom is going to be here.
[317:50.62]I need to wall that off.
[318:07.95]Alright.
[318:13.13]Door's gonna go... Where should the door... Yeah, over here.
[318:15.42]TV's over there.
[318:21.88]Bathroom's right here.
[318:22.60]I'll leave this open so I can put a door.
[318:27.42]Bathroom.
[318:32.44]And now what about one of the kitchen walls?
[318:34.22]That's a great question.
[318:35.40]What would I put on the walls?
[318:41.53]How about like, uh...
[318:46.16]Paint?
[318:46.82]I don't know.
[318:47.08]I feel like I'm doing too much paint.
[318:48.02]Wall tiles?
[318:48.66]What does this look like?
[319:04.74]Nah, it's too weird.
[319:06.78]Carpet walls.
[319:11.63]What happened to the baby videos?
[319:13.25]Oh, you must have missed the 12 minutes on stream yesterday where we did that.
[319:32.41]Hmm.
[319:47.56]Eh.
[319:50.28]Not feeling it.
[319:50.82]Um... Maybe... Forest Mist?
[320:06.00]Forest Mist?
[320:26.90]I think it's a- I like it.
[320:28.50]I'm digging it.
[320:29.34]It's not a vomit wall.
[320:49.30]It's a kitchen.
[321:02.44]Baby vomit.
[321:14.08]Alright.
[321:15.24]So, now that we have that done... I'm gonna put the... Let's get a fridge.
[321:25.05]I want a cool fridge.
[321:33.59]Alright, here we go.
[321:34.25]Is it- would it be furniture?
[321:35.31]Electronic equipment?
[321:37.41]What is- what is the classified as?
[321:41.93]Kitchen.
[321:45.71]Well, these are kitchen accessories.
[321:46.93]Would it be kitchen furniture?
[321:50.73]It would.
[321:51.27]Okay, so I need... Oh, this green!
[321:56.13]I'm thinking the green would look kinda good.
[321:58.19]What do you think, chat?
[322:00.43]Hey, chat.
[322:01.13]What do you guys think?
[322:01.69]Hey, chat.
[322:02.17]What do you think, chat?
[322:14.15]This is a walk-in fridge.
[322:24.28]Steel?
[322:24.54]What do you think?
[322:27.38]Stainless... Stainless steel?
[322:29.28]I think stainless steel looks good.
[322:42.67]Um, put it down.
[322:48.19]What's going on?
[322:49.53]Put this shit down.
[322:58.00]No, that's in a bad spot.
[323:00.44]Can I not put these here because the lights?
[323:06.56]What the hell?
[323:06.96]What's going on?
[323:15.65]Dude.
[323:20.50]Why?
[323:22.98]Oh, it's this, like, thing on the ground.
[323:24.88]Alright, fridge.
[323:32.85]Counters.
[323:41.65]And then I'm thinking... I like that.
[323:48.55]I like that, but I don't know what color I should do.
[323:56.33]Is green too powerful?
[323:57.73]Is that too much?
[323:58.29]Should I go with like a... Ooh!
[324:12.28]What about details?
[324:19.68]I'll give that a look.
[324:31.93]Huh?
[324:33.85]Make it teal?
[324:36.48]Eh.
[324:37.22]It's gotta be darker.
[324:37.98]Either darker or just white.
[324:44.76]Let's go with white.
[325:01.86]That's good.
[325:07.20]There's no light in here now.
[325:17.59]Mouth down incoming?
[325:18.85]No.
[325:19.15]This house is too sterile.
[325:24.84]The fridge has to be white then.
[325:29.29]This looks like a cheap, flipped Zillow house.
[325:33.74]I'm not a graphic designer.
[325:34.78]I don't know how to do this.
[325:35.42]Oh, hanging.
[325:47.49]Hanging cabinets?
[326:11.38]I don't know.
[326:14.10]I don't know.
[326:14.78]I don't... That's not bad.
[326:29.87]We better.
[326:39.36]Okay, now I need... I got the oven.
[326:41.90]I've got the range.
[326:43.32]I need lights.
[326:48.12]Stove needs a hood.
[326:54.66]Yeah, otherwise all the gas is gonna go somewhere.
[326:56.34]I need a sink.
[327:00.60]Wait, let me get this stuff in here first.
[327:03.64]I need a functional... Yeah, let's get some sink shit in here.
[327:11.53]Thank you.
[327:54.02]What am I doing?
[327:54.46]Is it in the right place?
[327:55.22]What the fuck is this thing?
[327:56.06]Oh.
[327:56.20]Alright.
[328:23.96]Alright.
[328:25.22]Sink.
[328:30.09]There's the oven.
[328:32.25]All these can open.
[328:37.97]There's a rest stop bathroom.
[328:39.70]I think it goes over here, though.
[328:41.04]There's a little bar.
[328:46.06]Okay.
[328:53.92]Now tell me, what's wrong with that?
[328:55.06]That looks okay.
[328:57.46]I should get like a trash compactor or something.
[329:01.97]Functional cabinets.
[329:02.73]Here we go.
[329:08.71]Dishwasher.
[329:13.45]Dishwasher.
[329:29.01]Stove, dishwasher... Little table?
[329:32.11]No, I'll come back to it.
[329:36.07]I don't know.
[329:36.65]I'll come back to it.
[329:44.71]I need some life in here!
[329:56.30]Crashing?
[329:59.46]I want those recessed cans.
[330:00.92]That doesn't look bad.
[330:17.13]Just get a huge piece of artwork right here and I'm done.
[330:31.10]Napkins, knife, forks.
[330:35.66]Yeah, put like little gravy boats and shit everywhere.
[330:46.53]Look, a bread box.
[330:56.50]A bedpan.
[331:09.05]Okay, sure.
[331:09.93]Cutting board.
[331:15.14]This is cute.
[331:17.22]Look.
[331:18.40]It's coming together.
[331:19.12]I like it.
[331:42.81]How about... Yep.
[331:45.24]A big bowl of fruit.
[331:55.06]Guys, 90% of house decoration... It's all just bullshit that's on the counters.
[332:05.17]Who nobody cares about the cubes in the house.
[332:07.55]What they care about is what painting's on the wall.
[332:09.88]And how many fruits you have in the fruit basket.
[332:11.30]I don't give a shit about anything else.
[332:13.18]It's all about detail work.
[332:15.68]Nothing else matters.
[332:16.59]Only detail work.
[332:36.69]You are the ultimate white guy.
[332:39.29]Why?
[332:39.59]Why?
[332:42.07]What?
[332:42.67]Why?
[332:43.15]What do you mean?
[332:44.71]What are you talking about?
[332:47.37]What?
[333:01.46]What?
[333:01.64]Why?
[333:01.96]Why?
[333:03.71]Why is the corner empty?
[333:04.89]Because I'm going to put something over there.
[333:06.80]I just haven't figured out what.
[333:08.48]Rome wasn't built in a day.
[333:09.94]It took them however long the Bible took to write.
[333:36.38]Alright, what am I getting?
[333:38.38]Right, okay, I need a table.
[333:42.88]Rome wasn't written in the Bible.
[333:47.24]What?
[333:48.32]Okay, Rome wasn't built in a day.
[333:51.48]What did God do?
[333:52.81]Garden of Eden or something?
[333:55.23]Garden of Eden wasn't built in a day?
[333:56.59]There's another saying.
[333:58.55]There's two of these.
[334:00.29]The Garden of Eden was crafted after, what is it?
[334:07.30]God did a lot of things.
[334:08.66]God made the world in seven days.
[334:10.12]Alright, yeah, that's what I mean.
[334:11.40]Rome wasn't built in a day.
[334:12.41]God took seven days to make the Earth.
[334:14.23]So I've got some time.
[334:15.57]I can't, it's not gonna say, I've been here for an hour.
[334:18.35]God got seven days.
[334:19.91]Give me seven days.
[334:21.11]Rome wasn't built in a day.
[334:21.93]Alright.
[334:33.78]Uh, I need a table.
[334:35.46]Even a little one.
[334:46.54]Should it be a dining room table?
[334:47.59]Ooh, I like that.
[335:02.16]Is this weird?
[335:03.42]To, like, open the door and this is the dining table?
[335:05.32]I don't think so.
[335:14.03]Where's it supposed to go?
[335:22.67]Just wait till I finish this.
[335:30.76]Look at all the detail work that God has done, right?
[335:33.76]Think about the detail work.
[335:35.16]Look at Mount Fiji, okay?
[335:38.24]You think God was really concerned that much about the pavement, like the gravel on the ground?
[335:42.86]No, he was busy crafting Mount Fiji in detail work.
[335:56.71]Here's your gravel on the ground.
[335:58.87]Just wait till I get to my Mount Fuji.
[336:11.15]Mount Fuji.
[336:11.87]That's... Yes.
[336:13.25]That's the one I'm referring to.
[336:14.21]Fuji's the water.
[336:21.58]Whatever.
[336:22.18]You know what I'm trying to say.
[336:27.11]I promise, I like graduated college.
[336:29.63]Maybe it just seeped out of me.
[336:33.29]Did it just seep out?
[336:35.67]Maybe there's like a hole in the back of my head and just like info is just slowly pissing out.
[336:39.47]Like a gas leak.
[336:45.60]I think I'm fine.
[336:46.30]I think I'm alright.
[336:47.68]PG is an island.
[336:53.02]Exactly what I'm talking about.
[336:56.63]Think about how much craft work God had to go through to craft that island of Fiji.
[337:02.58]All the... all the foliage, all the fawns, and all the stuff that's there.
[337:26.02]Somebody says lead exposure.
[337:34.86]Mount Fiji Island.
[337:37.28]Alright.
[337:38.03]Alright.
[337:38.89]Alright.
[337:39.27]Alright.
[337:39.67]Alright.
[337:40.05]Alright.
[337:40.45]Alright.
[337:40.77]Let's have a doorbell though.
[337:50.48]Nice apartment.
[337:52.12]No bread in there.
[337:52.78]Alright.
[337:54.94]I need some paintings.
[337:58.02]I'm like done streaming in like 10 minutes.
[337:59.84]Who cares?
[338:00.16]I mean, I do.
[338:02.94]I'm having fun.
[338:12.87]Check this detail work out.
[338:56.94]Just put like flowers and nature shit and just colors all over the place.
[339:01.67]You're gonna be fine.
[339:25.36]It's too big.
[339:26.26]Alright.
[339:26.62]Okay, hold on.
[339:48.23]I'm gonna have something hanging on the wall.
[339:51.97]I've got a decoration.
[340:04.38]Why would you have Medusa?
[340:05.52]I'm gonna find an excuse to leave your house if you have this Like I forgot to brush my teeth I have to go home
[340:44.26]You know, y'all are giving me shit for this, but I guarantee you, you know somebody in your life that has this kind of shit everywhere.
[340:59.37]I betcha.
[341:03.25]You've walked into somebody's kitchen and gone, what the hell is going on in here?
[341:06.45]There's like a weird bronze greyhound statue in the corner in the kitchen.
[341:24.36]Alright.
[341:28.13]Alright, I'm done.
[341:28.95]Let's do the bathroom.
[341:37.47]Table bothers me.
[341:38.31]It needs to be smaller.
[341:39.27]I agree with you.
[341:40.57]That's it.
[341:42.91]Floor.
[341:43.25]How about... Stone white tiles?
[341:49.80]Let's see.
[341:50.18]How's this look?
[342:07.15]The table's not good.
[342:08.21]I know.
[342:08.54]It needs to be in a smaller and different spot.
[342:17.34]Why is the bathroom so big?
[342:18.34]I don't know.
[342:21.23]I guess I want room to shower and to bathe and to go in the tub and stuff, which reminds me.
[342:26.09]I think I'm doing a bath bomb tonight.
[342:29.35]I think so.
[342:36.38]Alright, ones in the chat if you want to do a bath bomb.
[342:43.83]Lush Andy.
[342:52.67]Did you ever get what?
[342:53.99]Did you ever get Popeye's?

[342:58.42]I have not.
[343:04.81]Alright, let me put... Alright, walls.
[343:09.79]Something interesting in the bathroom here.
[343:12.19]Ooh, this is kind of cool.
[343:15.35]How does this look?
[343:18.92]Awful?
[343:19.18]Let's find out.
[343:19.64]It's not what I thought I picked up.
[343:23.66]Pop ice fries?
[343:31.41]Yep.
[343:35.06]What does this actually look like?
[343:36.10]Okay.
[343:54.60]Pretty ocean.
[344:24.75]Uh, the ground could use a little bit of work.
[344:32.15]Get help.
[344:38.99]Why?
[344:39.27]Because you don't like my choices?
[344:50.97]This guy is on drugs.
[344:52.99]I am not on drugs.
[344:59.02]I'm on what God gave me.
[345:01.30]Oxygen.
[345:02.56]Life.
[345:06.35]Maybe pick up the Bible.
[345:07.85]Once in a while, okay?
[345:20.64]Why does it look so shitty?
[345:26.09]Is that the light?
[345:26.73]I think it's the light.
[345:29.21]Alright, so now I need a... I want a tub.
[345:39.26]Whoa.
[345:42.06]Are you shitting me?
[345:42.80]Yep.

[346:13.56]Ah, okay, we get fixtures.
[346:14.40]I need plumbing.
[346:22.86]Urinal?
[346:24.44]I actually want one of these.

[357:38.44]I should, on Christmas Eve, be able to give you guys a link to take the end of the New Year's Eve stream the awards.
[357:48.15]So you should be able to vote for what you want to vote for.
[357:50.65]Hopefully, as of New Year's Eve, if I can't get it ready by New Year's Eve, if I can't get the poll ready...
[357:56.76]then I'm probably going to have to delay the New Year's Eve stream.
[358:02.82]Should be more like a New Year's, first week of New Year's stream.
[358:07.58]But I'm very confident I can get it ready by the 24th.

[358:16.15]I think six hours is perfect here.
[358:21.14]Thanks for watching.
[358:22.72]It was fun.
[358:24.08]House Flipper is always an adventure.
[358:26.66]Didn't really get to build anything weird this time, but... It's just fun to hang out and fuck around with you guys, so... As always.
