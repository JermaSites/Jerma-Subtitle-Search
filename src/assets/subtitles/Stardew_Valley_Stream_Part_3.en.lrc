[00:22.76]Hey, sup?
[00:29.99]Where did we leave off?
[00:33.37]I don't remember.
[00:33.99]Hey, peaceful bacteria.
[00:39.51]Welcome back yourself.
[00:43.83]Is it a good bone?
[00:46.25]My dog is a little chewy.
[00:47.91]And he refuses to chew it.
[00:49.75]He's walking around with it in his mouth.
[00:52.89]It's been like that for, like, probably at least 20 minutes.
[00:59.41]Okay, it's been, like, a few days since I've played this game.
[01:03.97]Literally, I have done nothing.
[01:05.77]This is, like, this is my stream game, right?
[01:11.46]Let me see what I got here.
[01:14.24]Oh, hello.
[01:15.52]Hi.
[01:17.02]Welcome back.
[01:20.84]Let's see.
[01:21.34]Let me remember the controls.
[01:24.41]X Yeah, oops You've missed me.
[01:34.29]I've only been gone for a couple of days.

[01:46.98]Thanks, dude Welcome Thank you
[01:52.93]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[01:59.39]Hey, Ronnie, with the four months.
[02:03.33]That was back-to-back Orson Welles, man.
[02:05.07]Alright, I need to remember what I was doing.
[02:10.20]I know I have a cornfield down here, that's all I remember.
[02:12.50]Oh yeah, I was going to make... What the hell was I going to make?
[02:16.48]Those sprinklers.
[02:18.18]I need sprinklers here.
[02:21.43]Because this is a real pain in the ass.
[02:33.69]Yeah, the other sub sounds working again.
[02:35.37]I don't know why it wasn't working last time.
[02:37.43]It didn't really make any sense.
[02:45.21]But yeah, a new video is going up tomorrow.
[02:51.01]If you are inclined to watch a new video that I'm making.
[02:55.03]It's a real- it's a real odd one!
[02:58.33]But I'm, uh... I think it's funny, so... You know, whatever.
[03:02.50]That's the way it is.
[03:07.66]The sprinklers are awful.
[03:09.98]Yeah, but I don't wanna, like, do this.
[03:11.92]Should I just do the bucket?
[03:13.14]Uh, upgrade the bucket?
[03:18.59]I won't forget to water the dog.
[03:20.81]Don't worry.
[03:23.09]Speaking of dogs, my dog so badly wants to leave this room.
[03:27.87]He's staring at me.
[03:28.79]His Chewie is on the ground.
[03:30.87]And he is staring at me.
[03:32.57]He's like, please let me sprint upstairs with this in my mouth.
[03:36.61]No, chew it in here.
[03:37.61]Chew it right there.
[03:39.91]Why does he want to sprint around with it in his mouth?
[03:42.24]What a weirdo.
[03:45.08]Yeah, I'll upgrade the bucket.
[03:46.46]That's probably a better... Alright, these are done.
[03:48.13]These are done.
[03:50.85]Just side them up.
[03:52.91]Serve them.
[03:56.05]Do you hear him?
[03:56.79]Do you hear that, dog?
[03:59.65]He's going to do it again.
[04:00.95]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[04:07.56]Red Ranger.
[04:08.26]Is this the original Red Ranger account?
[04:10.54]I believe it is.

[04:41.93]MrChamp6190.
[04:42.69]Welcome to the family.
[04:46.73]Hey, can we get some family heirlooms in the chat, please?
[04:53.87]Alright, let me let him out.
[04:55.13]Because he so badly wants to just get out of here and sprint with a chewy in his mouth.
[05:00.01]He's not going to chew it.
[05:00.89]He just wants to run around my house with it in his mouth.
[05:03.82]Is that what you want to do?
[05:05.92]Okay, well, I'll see you in like 30 minutes when you still haven't chewed it.
[05:15.38]Okay.
[05:22.17]Watering seems kind of calming.
[05:23.69]I mean, it kind of is.
[05:25.75]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[05:30.33]Hey, look, it's Gungeldorf.
[05:33.16]That's an interesting name.
[05:34.98]Gungeldorf.
[05:36.04]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[05:39.30]Alright, where's my... Where's my side?
[05:40.98]There it is.
[05:43.02]I at least can get this.
[05:45.85]What is this?
[05:46.51]Freaking wheat?
[05:49.75]Okay, two wheat.
[05:51.91]This is just kind of like, I want to get rid of these.
[05:55.28]So once I get to harvest this, it's gone.
[05:58.16]I'm going to go over this whole thing with like a torch.
[06:00.84]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[06:04.82]Tompeil Soussi.
[06:08.41]That's an interesting, that's like a Mississippi with a T. Tompil's... Jesus.
[06:15.49]Hey, Tyler!
[06:16.69]Hey, Tompy!
[06:17.65]Thanks for subscribing!
[06:21.24]Welcome to the Cheeto-eatin' Cheeto shitheads!
[06:27.06]Let's get a, uh... How much is the bucket?
[06:30.38]No, I think I might have enough to get that new bucket.
[06:37.46]I actually think I do.
[06:38.62]It's 2000, right?
[06:47.05]Dangerously cheesy.
[06:49.25]I gotta go to this dude down here.
[06:53.05]The blacksmith.
[06:55.01]Oh, he's only up until 4 o'clock.
[06:57.07]Go, go, go, go, go.
[07:08.02]He's right underneath the trailer.
[07:11.04]Just bring copper with you.
[07:12.44]I actually don't think I have copper bars.
[07:15.26]So, I just want to see what it actually entails.
[07:18.54]Copper watering can.
[07:19.50]Five copper bars and 2,000 gold.
[07:23.58]Okay, I don't... I wasn't going to make it anyways because I don't even have smelted copper bars.
[07:29.36]Let's go do that.
[07:36.54]When was the last harvest moon?
[07:44.47]Nintendo DS?
[07:46.05]Was it that long ago?
[07:51.77]Or like 3DS or something?
[07:55.37]Am I going to play Overwatch this stream?
[07:57.01]Maybe.
[07:58.43]It depends on how things go.
[08:00.21]I'm kind of procrastinating.
[08:03.55]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[08:06.63]What's going on, Loroy?
[08:10.41]Welcome to the... What did I say?
[08:12.69]Like the Cheeto... Guys...
[08:15.49]Welcome to the family.
[08:16.31]Thanks for subbing.
[08:18.01]They're still making them several on 3DS.
[08:19.33]Just released it.
[08:20.01]Well, that's cool.
[08:21.17]Are they as fleshed out as they used to be?
[08:23.44]Because I actually do remember like the old Harvest Moon games were very oddly detailed, weren't they?
[08:28.18]Okay, do I have enough?
[08:32.78]I should have enough.
[08:37.14]I have to have the coal in the inventory.
[08:38.34]Need five.
[08:50.72]Harvest Moon was just a western published name.
[08:55.04]That's a cool name, though.
[08:56.20]Harvest Moon.
[09:02.30]They have gotten more complex.
[09:03.46]That's kind of cool.
[09:06.22]That's interesting, I guess.
[09:15.72]Yeah, something about this game, I don't know what it is.
[09:17.62]I don't really like these management, in quotes, games.
[09:21.50]I'm not like a big fan of them.
[09:22.88]I get real bored, extremely.
[09:24.54]I get bored so easily that it is actually sort of shocking to me that I still want to load this game up.
[09:34.46]Something about timers and needing to come back tomorrow, come back tomorrow.
[09:39.82]Time has to pass, time has to pass.
[09:42.73]You know, just give me a machine gun.
[09:47.19]So I can just, you know, like... Just do that to the plants and then make them grow.
[09:53.53]Give me a machine gun with fertilizer in it.
[10:03.08]Guessing you don't like the Civ games.
[10:04.40]No, not really.
[10:07.68]I have ADHD.
[10:08.70]I can't, like, stand it.
[10:09.88]See, even my character has to move around.
[10:19.44]You're gonna hit on the head at Pax like last time?
[10:22.34]Dude, that was fucking ridiculous.
[10:26.93]That was ridiculous.
[10:32.59]That was... Go down.
[10:33.55]That was one of the... Oh, okay, I got five.
[10:36.40]I forgot I had one in the inventory.
[10:38.74]I can't fucking believe that happened.
[10:41.08]That was outrageous.
[10:48.76]Yeah, even going into my, like, late 20s, early 30s, ADHD still, like, is a hamstring of my everyday life.
[10:59.61]Okay, well, I got seven.
[11:02.45]Do I actually need it in my inventory?
[11:03.71]Probably.
[11:04.45]Okay, let's do it.
[11:05.03]Oh, it's seven o'clock.
[11:07.79]Yeah, back to bed.
[11:13.24]Back to bed.
[11:20.43]What happened?
[11:21.17]Back in like 2012 or like 2013, I like smashed my face at PAX.
[11:31.45]Oh, we can harvest these.
[11:33.80]I need to get like four stitches in my forehead.
[11:37.40]It didn't happen like on the PAX floor, it happened in the hotel room.
[11:51.80]Make some money from these.
[11:55.96]I don't like how these are situated either.
[11:58.36]Oh, come on.
[11:58.92]You know what?
[11:59.64]Just because I might have to just cut this down.
[12:04.44]I think I'm gonna.
[12:10.12]Quiz time.
[12:14.85]Yeah, Zeno's DB.
[12:15.83]We like to omit that part.
[12:18.14]We omit that part.
[12:20.92]From the record.
[12:21.56]Okay, let's go get our... I'll come back and water these.
[12:28.87]I'm not going to do this.
[12:29.55]I'm going to water them later.
[12:30.73]Remember when I bought 100 corn seeds and people got pissed?
[12:40.04]Yeah, and take a look now.
[12:41.10]They're growing nicely.
[12:48.68]I don't want to sell these.
[12:50.88]Ugh.
[12:53.22]Monsters known as Slime are throwing the elemental balance into disarray.
[12:57.45]Kill Force, Slime... No, I don't even... That's chump change right now.
[13:07.17]Anything in the trash?
[13:08.77]Fuck!
[13:09.17]That guy had to open the door right when I... It's almost like he was watching me out the window and wanted to catch me in the act.
[13:21.82]Alright, let's go to the shopkeeper.
[13:33.89]Who are you going to marry?
[13:34.83]Absolutely nobody, because nobody likes me in this town.
[13:36.78]Everybody hates me.
[13:41.24]9 AM.
[13:41.62]We can sit here for a minute.
[13:49.63]Jerma, stop, please.
[13:56.91]I don't think you can break into the shop and steal stuff.
[13:59.39]It's not that open-ended.
[14:03.05]It's more so... You get a farm, and you get to kind of do whatever you want with the farm.
[14:08.62]You can grow pretty much whatever you want, if the season allows you to.
[14:13.26]And... You also have a bunch of townspeople.
[14:19.88]That can like you.
[14:20.69]You can marry them, I guess.
[14:22.75]I don't know.
[14:23.69]Nobody talks to me in the town, so...
[14:29.43]I hate how slow this guy works.
[14:33.57]A couple days.
[14:34.47]I hate that.
[14:36.61]He should just have them.
[14:38.80]You know, if there are people that are coming in here looking for... That's a service you have?
[14:42.56]Have a couple done already.
[14:43.48]You're going to do per order?
[14:49.30]Captain O'Leary.
[14:51.88]French champagne.
[14:54.63]It's always been celebrated for its excellence.
[14:57.35]Uh, Neutral Tyrant, thanks for resubbing.
[14:59.57]Three months.
[15:00.05]Thanks for interrupting my awful joke about, like, Shark Tank.
[15:09.84]What I was gonna say is Kevin O'Leary would never sign off on that guy's deal.
[15:15.86]You won't be able to water your door!
[15:20.66]What?
[15:21.28]What?
[15:21.64]What do you mean?
[15:22.18]What do you mean?! !
[15:24.40]He took it!
[15:25.60]He took it!
[15:31.94]Oh, no.
[15:32.58]I'm like, they're all gonna die.
[15:38.73]Please tell me it's gonna rain.
[15:45.57]What?
[15:46.65]Why?
[15:47.07]How would I... How would...
[15:52.51]I didn't know he, like, takes it.
[15:53.95]I thought he just said, oh, yeah, that one looks like shit.
[15:56.55]I'll give you a new one.
[15:59.25]I gotta figure something out quick.
[16:03.69]Sprinklers, I guess.
[16:04.41]I don't know, but how are you supposed to... Can I just, like, use my hands and cup it into the lake and then dump it on the water?
[16:14.32]They're not gonna die in two days?
[16:23.97]Back to bed.
[16:31.71]They won't die.
[16:32.47]Thank God.
[16:33.11]I almost had a heart attack.
[16:44.51]I'm so compulsory right now.
[16:46.75]They're going to die on my watch.
[16:56.55]Put it in.
[17:00.25]Put it in.
[17:00.61]What the hell are you doing?
[17:08.91]Yep, back to bed.
[17:18.57]Clean the farm.
[17:20.77]I still need to get animals.
[17:23.01]Wait, choose a profession.
[17:31.12]So I don't have any animals, so this seems like the better idea at the moment.
[17:36.02]So that's what I'm going to do.
[17:36.86]Ooh.
[17:44.77]Man, these peppers.
[17:47.01]Man, these peppers are worth a lot.
[18:00.24]I got plenty of money.
[18:02.60]What am I gonna do for two days?
[18:10.33]I guess I could go back to the... Yeah, I'll do that.
[18:13.17]I'll spend a day in the mine attacking things.
[18:15.84]Oh, hold on.
[18:22.72]Can you get the mail, please?
[18:27.50]Long story short, I need a fresh melon from your farm.
[18:29.92]If you brought me one, I'd be very grateful.
[18:32.68]Have you ever been here?
[18:35.18]Oh, hey, Greg.
[18:36.42]I know you don't grow these.
[18:38.00]You have a bunch of corn and peppers.
[18:40.42]But I need one of your melons.
[18:43.81]I don't have melons.
[18:46.99]I don't grow those.
[18:50.83]Are these melons?
[18:51.57]They're not even close to being ready.
[18:55.39]I don't even know what these are.
[18:56.39]I truly don't.
[18:57.95]I completely forget what these are.
[19:00.12]They might be melons.
[19:02.90]I don't know.
[19:04.06]Are those corns?
[19:05.42]They look the same as the corn.
[19:11.21]This is getting overrun.
[19:14.57]Yeah, this is an eyesore.
[19:26.51]It's just disgusting.
[19:29.11]It's just revolting me.
[19:34.63]Where's my weed killer?
[19:42.06]Now, last time you subscribed, I didn't know how to say your name.
[19:46.58]Megalomaniacal Halide.
[19:48.30]See, I got it right this time.
[19:49.22]Thanks for resubbing, dude.
[19:50.54]Uh-oh, now I can't water the dog for two days.
[19:58.22]Yeah, I'm going to go to the mine.
[19:59.12]I'm going to put all this stuff in there.
[20:06.15]Let's just go in there with plenty of energy.
[20:15.68]Don't need the fishing pole.
[20:18.70]This is good.
[20:22.56]I want to try to go down deeper into the mine if I can't do anything else.
[20:25.16]What's the point, right?
[20:30.03]Ah, the French champagne.
[20:32.93]It's always been celebrated for its excellence.
[20:39.88]I wish he was a relative of mine.
[20:43.60]Imagine going to family reunions.
[20:45.86]Or Thanksgiving with Orson Welles.
[20:50.28]Please pass the peas.
[20:52.86]Pass the mashed potatoes.
[20:57.65]These mashed potatoes are divine.
[21:01.32]He's wearing a big bib.
[21:02.14]Man, that'd be great.
[21:03.68]I'm going the wrong way.
[21:08.84]What's the dog for, by the way?
[21:10.24]I have no idea.
[21:13.17]Maybe if you have animals, he does something?
[21:24.55]You didn't know who Orson Welles was until I started using that sound?
[21:27.44]That's a shame, because he's an American classic.
[21:33.00]The dog is useless.
[21:35.38]Well, he's just kind of a dog, right?
[21:36.62]He's kind of just fun to be around.
[21:42.83]Alright, what the hell am I doing?
[21:48.71]I haven't played this game for like three or four days, so I forget where everything is.
[21:51.77]Mine's all the way at the top right.
[21:57.01]Oh, berries!
[21:57.51]I'll be eating those.
[22:04.33]Hey.
[22:05.47]Found it.
[22:08.32]25.
[22:08.42]Let's get down to 40.
[22:09.90]Let's get down to 40.
[22:10.50]Hey, look.
[22:16.54]Let's just go.
[22:16.94]I don't care.
[22:18.68]I want to get to 40.
[22:19.44]The faster I can do that, the better.
[22:25.21]But we will smash this rogue.
[22:32.96]Is there more than one of these guys?
[22:34.28]Oh, Geodude, nice.
[22:37.52]Nice.
[22:46.70]I got a lot of copper.
[22:47.54]Can you do anything else with copper?
[22:53.81]Or is copper mainly just to upgrade your pickaxes and stuff?
[22:57.37]Can you, like, build stuff with it?
[23:08.63]There is a very high chance that I make it to 40 here.
[23:13.25]As long as I don't dilly-dally.
[23:16.51]Ooh, iron.
[23:19.91]Wait, was that just a random iron ore?
[23:21.75]Why did that come out of a standard rock?
[23:25.00]That didn't make very much sense.
[23:28.44]Come on, give me the ladder.
[23:32.34]Give me the ladder.
[23:33.34]There we go.
[23:43.33]Jerma, quality sprinklers are worth it.
[23:45.07]You can unlock them at farming level 6.
[23:48.43]Well, let's see if I can get there.
[23:51.43]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[23:54.43]Christopher Walken.
[23:58.89]Not Christopher Walken, Christopher Walking.
[24:01.32]Like you're walking around.
[24:02.18]Thanks for serving.
[24:06.98]We are honored by your presence.
[24:11.50]Especially the presence of the moon.
[24:21.05]Oh, I could make a couple more emos too.
[24:22.63]That's another thing I was gonna do.
[24:23.47]I've been working on this video for like a few days though.
[24:25.85]What the hell?
[24:26.15]What's going on?
[24:29.10]Is this the real poison gas?
[24:32.78]I have mistook a lot of things in this game for poison gas, but this is po- that's poison gas.
[24:38.26]If that's not poison gas, I don't know what it could be.
[24:47.47]Do I- do I run or something?
[24:55.26]Am I gonna die?
[24:58.25]What the fuck was... What was that?
[24:59.91]What was that?
[25:00.83]That didn't make any sense.
[25:05.57]It really was gas.
[25:13.84]God, they started fucking gashing me.
[25:21.22]I'm gonna eat some stuff.
[25:29.10]The gas summons monsters?
[25:31.36]Whatever.
[25:31.66]I guess that makes sense, huh?
[25:36.12]What time is it?
[25:39.24]3 o'clock.
[25:39.58]Got plenty of time.
[25:40.42]Let's go.
[25:40.82]11 o'clock is my curfew is when I have to get out of here.
[25:47.02]Once 11pm rolls around, you gotta go.
[25:48.88]Otherwise you kind of just get stuck down here.
[25:54.96]And then some dude finds you and takes all the money out of your wallet.
[26:00.71]Can I reference that for just a second here?
[26:03.21]So every single time you pass out, you fall asleep with it.
[26:08.23]Oh, I got too tired.
[26:09.32]I fell asleep.
[26:10.12]Every time.
[26:11.72]Either somebody brings you to the hospital or somebody steals your wallet.
[26:17.78]Now, let's just take into consideration somebody stealing your wallet, right?
[26:23.25]It can't be the same person every time.
[26:24.77]If you pass out in the mine, somebody's going to find you.
[26:28.05]It's not going to be the same person that found you passed out in front of the lake.
[26:31.47]So let's just deduce that by saying everybody that finds me in this game takes money out of my wallet.
[26:41.04]Why?
[26:41.50]Why does everybody have to steal money from me?
[26:45.78]And honestly, the people that bring you to the hospital might be... I would rather them take your wallet because the hospital costs more money, doesn't it?
[26:59.26]I don't know.
[27:00.90]But no one has ever brought me back to my house.
[27:04.05]Hey, I found you.
[27:05.79]You were passed out.
[27:07.07]Don't worry.
[27:07.55]I, like, secured your wallet for you.
[27:09.37]You're gonna be fine.
[27:10.05]Here's your money.
[27:10.53]I got it.
[27:11.47]You're fine.
[27:16.43]It's probably the dog.
[27:18.06]Ooh!
[27:19.34]An Omnigeodude.
[27:20.64]That's the evolved version.
[27:24.46]What?
[27:26.58]These Geodudes contain a wide variety of minerals.
[27:30.38]Oh my god, it's like a piece of funfetti cake.
[27:33.68]This one's got sprinkles.
[27:35.44]I can't wait to open this one.
[27:36.54]It's got sprinkles!
[27:44.81]I'm excited to open that now.
[27:53.84]What level am I at?
[27:54.42]29?
[27:54.44]6 p.m.
[28:01.02]Hey, look, level up.
[28:02.20]Oh, here comes the poison gas.
[28:03.58]See ya.
[28:05.78]And there's level 30.
[28:06.52]I have maybe like another couple hours down here.
[28:10.18]That should last me down here.
[28:19.73]Ooh, getting dark.
[28:25.47]New enemies.
[28:28.01]Uh-oh.
[28:30.41]What is that?
[28:30.93]Is that a person?
[28:35.31]What is going on?
[28:36.34]I'm being surrounded by spiders and bats.
[28:40.50]Okay, this is a little scarier.
[28:47.28]These guys still barely even hurt me.
[28:58.04]Bat wings.
[29:00.14]Can I put that in a stew for the mayor?
[29:01.70]Just trying to see if there's any other ore down here.
[29:05.06]Is this where I get to the game where I have to have torches?
[29:12.14]Probably.
[29:16.58]Yeah.
[29:17.24]Uh-oh.
[29:18.42]Another zombie.
[29:24.40]Fuck outta here.
[29:30.64]Yeah, I was gonna play it safe.
[29:32.84]By play it safe, I mean drop a fucking bomb right here and collect all the ore.
[29:40.02]Nice.
[29:40.32]Yeah, it's probably a safe time to go back.
[29:53.07]Plenty of bat wings.
[29:53.83]Let's go one more.
[29:56.81]Ooh, I knew I should have gone one more.
[30:02.56]Topaz.
[30:08.42]8, 9.
[30:14.55]Lots of copper.
[30:15.39]So I'm going to have to make some torches.
[30:18.61]Because this is absolutely where the game begins.
[30:23.41]Telling you, hey, you can't see anything.
[30:25.43]Bring a torch.
[30:30.66]Ooh.
[30:30.76]Ooh.
[30:36.18]Yeah, it's time to go.
[30:39.40]Time to go.
[30:40.18]Last rock.
[30:41.34]Pick it up.
[30:41.98]Back to bed.
[30:47.14]Is there like a little shortcut over here?
[30:48.58]Yeah.
[30:50.26]Back to bed.
[30:50.82]I got to 30.
[30:53.20]Slowly making my way to 40.
[30:59.58]How would I feel if I saw people cosplaying my system as me?
[31:02.81]I don't understand what that means.
[31:04.85]Your system?
[31:13.61]Back to bed.
[31:20.62]I've got a lot of stuff.
[31:21.46]I wonder if I could sell the Batwings.
[31:22.62]I wonder if it's even worth it.
[31:31.15]Wait, wait a second.
[31:33.89]Can I show an interest in the stars?
[31:35.41]Maybe she'll be friends with me?
[31:37.71]It's hard to really grasp the scale of the universe.
[31:41.56]Yeah, it is.
[31:45.21]Fucking smasher thing.
[31:49.04]How dare you look at me.
[31:56.28]Oh, my solar system.
[31:59.61]I don't even know how you do that.
[32:03.99]How do you get in a big foam ball and paint it?
[32:13.97]You know, I could have taken this quest.
[32:20.07]Refined quartz.
[32:20.87]I don't have that.
[32:26.82]I'm not going to get taken to the hospital again.
[32:28.18]I'm going to be fine.
[32:30.82]I'm going to be fine.
[32:32.08]I have like two hours before that would happen anyways.
[32:41.82]Ah.
[32:43.11]It's getting late.
[32:45.23]Yeah, wait, hold on.
[32:48.99]Everything I can sell here?
[32:51.48]Yeah, we got bug meat.
[32:56.20]I'm just gonna see what they're worth.
[32:57.70]I can get them again.
[33:04.50]Chewing stick?
[33:06.94]I guess I can donate it.
[33:11.08]Chewing stick.
[33:13.03]Oh, hey, dog.
[33:13.59]Hey there, boy.
[33:25.85]That's not terrible.
[33:29.04]Not great, either.
[33:38.46]Please don't be dead, plants.
[33:41.64]I'm so scared that one of these days they're going to be all dried out.
[33:44.00]It's going to be all my fault.
[33:46.42]Okay.
[33:48.92]Let's go break down the Geodudes.
[33:55.33]I can go to the mine again.
[33:56.59]That's what I'm going to do.
[33:58.85]Break down the Geodudes.
[34:01.67]And then go to the mine.
[34:07.59]You're now addicted to this game.
[34:09.61]It's very addicting.
[34:11.40]It's very addicting.
[34:15.64]Oh, here we go.
[34:16.64]Kill eight slimes.
[34:18.62]Easy.
[34:20.32]I'm going there anyways.
[34:25.63]I'm just spilling it.
[34:26.77]That is my champagne.
[34:30.67]Come on, guys.
[34:31.17]Ceremonial champagne coffee.
[34:41.79]Let's check on the watering can.
[34:43.85]And... 9 a.m.
[34:49.43]That's a long time from now.
[34:54.91]What's wrong with my character?
[34:56.83]He's a duck.
[34:58.99]He's Butthead from Beavis and Butthead.
[35:00.77]Except he has a duck bill.
[35:04.71]He's Butthead Charlie Brown Duckman.
[35:12.19]Could fish but I don't have my fishing pole here No, I'm gonna pretend to fish Say mmm cupcakes mmm cupcakes What do I get where's my commission where's my commission for saying that I'm kidding.
[35:32.94]Don't worry.
[35:33.62]That's a joke.
[35:34.88]Come on guys.
[35:35.68]Oh
[35:40.77]Rip my duck bill off and donate it to the museum.
[35:46.15]That would be interesting.
[35:55.58]Come on, open...
[36:01.64]You're putting champagne in your iced coffee.
[36:05.42]No, this is just straight up iced coffee from Dunkin' Donuts.
[36:08.92]It's full of all the delicious iced coffee you could ever want.
[36:11.64]It's got hazelnut, it's got a little bit of French vanilla, it's got all kinds of cool flavorings in it.
[36:21.34]Yes!
[36:21.52]I got it.
[36:24.57]You received a copper watering can.
[36:29.93]Steel watering can.
[36:34.24]Sponsors stream on Dunkin Donuts sucks.
[36:37.40]There you go.
[36:41.89]I would say like at least 40 to 50% of every time I go to Dunkin Donuts, it is like one of the worst coffees I've ever drank.
[36:51.78]But it's that 50%, that other 50% that, you know, you might get one that does not taste like somebody peed into a cup of burnt coffee.
[37:06.84]How much is it to process this?
[37:16.57]Alright, here we go.
[37:17.87]Guys, you ready?
[37:24.55]Here we go.
[37:24.97]Are you serious?
[37:32.30]Oh my god, that was fucking terrible.
[37:42.86]Oh, what a rare stone.
[37:49.35]Unbelievable.
[37:54.59]Okay, let's see what happens from a regular one.
[37:56.78]Oh, wow.
[37:57.46]Hey, I just opened up a regular one and I got calcite.
[38:02.48]Cool.
[38:03.22]What's the next one?
[38:04.40]Ooh, an extremely rare artifact.
[38:07.08]Nikoyite?
[38:08.23]Oh, what about this one?
[38:09.87]Oh, there's three coal.
[38:10.85]An extremely useful piece of material.
[38:12.74]That was such a fucking... I must have rolled in the two percentile to get that.
[38:26.37]Like, don't get me wrong, right?
[38:27.53]I'm seeing some people in the chat really upset about my Dunkin' Donuts stance.
[38:31.55]I drink Dunkin' Donuts all the goddamn time.
[38:36.37]I drink more Dunkin' Donuts coffee than I probably drink water.
[38:42.80]It's just there's so many Dunkin' Donuts.
[38:45.06]There's so many of them.
[38:46.08]There's, like, there's a Dunkin' Donuts in every single town and county.
[38:51.69]So, like, one Dunkin' Donuts might be, like, kinda good, but the Dunkin' Donuts that's, like, right next to it, like, the drive-thru, somebody, like, it just sucks.
[38:59.54]Like, the workers, they don't do it right.
[39:04.02]That's what I'm talking about, like, 50 per, like, it's a gamble.
[39:07.72]It is a gamble.
[39:13.67]That does, that explains the piss, it does.
[39:21.72]We've got a chewing stick.
[39:24.76]Put this in the corner.
[39:32.59]You know, let's just do some donating, because I want more rewards.
[39:39.78]Alright, we've got lots of stuff in there now.
[39:41.00]Two more things.
[39:43.14]I drink coffee from a lot of places.
[39:47.54]I make my own coffee when I'm bored and I don't feel like, you know, going and spending money on coffee.
[39:56.38]But I drink a lot of coffee.
[40:01.86]The best coffee, the best iced coffee I've probably ever had was from one of those little, like, hoity-toity mom-and-pop stores.
[40:11.21]That was just like, yeah, we do iced coffee and donuts and we do bagels too!
[40:16.16]And you get an iced coffee and they make it there and they grind the beans.
[40:30.10]What the hell do I want to do now?
[40:32.41]It's kind of late.
[40:33.67]Back to the mine.
[40:41.49]Never really had it.
[40:42.91]If you don't drink coffee, don't start.
[40:45.55]Unless you need to.
[40:52.17]Pam?
[40:53.31]No, Penny.
[40:53.79]Sorry.
[40:54.58]Wrong name.
[41:03.92]Noon equals late.
[41:04.78]It is!
[41:05.12]Especially if you want to go to the mine.
[41:06.58]Because you can get lost in there.
[41:23.33]Give her a piece of copper.
[41:24.91]No, it's my money.
[41:26.13]It's my money.
[41:28.89]This is an easier time of year for me.
[41:30.98]I don't have to worry about staying warm.
[41:33.40]I should start to stab him.
[41:46.22]You've got a keen eye, old man.
[41:47.74]I'll give you that.
[41:49.74]I don't let anybody get behind me.
[42:01.23]Here we go.
[42:08.84]Come on, 40.
[42:11.12]Come on, 40.
[42:12.82]Just like my upcoming birthday.
[42:15.30]40, come on.
[42:18.97]I can celebrate this especially when I turn 40.
[42:20.91]This upcoming year, 40.
[42:22.57]Those eyes.
[42:27.77]What is this?
[42:28.91]Oh God, it's one of those people.
[42:35.11]I didn't know that's what that was.
[42:40.15]What are my plans?
[42:40.75]I'll do it tonight.
[42:42.59]This should be fine, right?
[42:44.17]I hope so.
[42:56.93]Yeah, I'll see you at 40.
[43:06.02]Jerma's 40?
[43:06.36]You didn't know that?
[43:08.26]You didn't know that I was 39 turning 40?
[43:10.58]In like one month?
[43:14.34]I don't know.
[43:18.79]I can't see anything.
[43:26.19]It could be over here somewhere.
[43:27.27]I just don't know.
[43:28.91]This probably wasn't a great idea.
[43:30.11]Maybe I can get to 35.
[43:40.09]Shit.
[43:41.05]It might be over there.
[43:41.89]I just can't see it.
[43:45.97]Oh, shoot.
[43:47.47]Oh, shoot.
[43:48.03]Fuck.
[43:57.12]I'm, like, wasting all my energy looking for the... Uh...
[44:09.71]42 to be exact.
[44:14.02]I'm 41, I'll be 42.
[44:15.34]What month are we in?
[44:21.16]I'm in April.
[44:23.38]April 28th.
[44:27.54]I can't, I have no idea.
[44:28.34]I'm going to have to leave.
[44:29.08]Because I can't, I have no idea what this fucking thing is.
[44:31.50]I'm leaving.
[44:36.93]I'm not dealing with that.
[44:37.97]I'm going to get torches.
[44:46.70]Even if I go down, that's going to happen again.
[44:49.32]I'd rather just go water my plants.
[44:58.12]Stop lying.
[44:59.66]I'm not lying.
[45:03.49]I'm 42.
[45:04.45]31.
[45:07.15]Whoa, that's not right.
[45:08.77]That's not even real.
[45:17.24]Back to bed.
[45:22.68]Oh, not back to bed yet.
[45:23.54]I want to see how good this is.
[45:26.10]Alright, let's do it.
[45:33.09]How is this better?
[45:35.71]Oh, that's how.
[45:52.41]See, you can do three at a time, but it takes as long to water two to water three with the old can.
[46:05.46]Isn't that special?
[46:19.19]Ugh.
[46:21.71]Ugh.
[46:26.99]I thought this was going to be quicker than this.
[46:36.15]It's a bit quicker, I guess.
[46:37.55]I don't know if it's $2,000 quicker.
[46:40.83]As my grandmother would probably say.
[46:46.02]I mean, sure, it's quicker, but is it $2,000 quicker?
[46:47.56]I don't think so.
[47:00.23]I guess it is quicker.
[47:01.12]Gonna go to your midterm?
[47:04.76]Well, good luck on your midterm.
[47:07.02]Hopefully you get a straight A-plus on every question.
[47:19.15]Saves energy.
[47:19.83]Does it save energy?
[47:20.55]I mean, wouldn't it take a little bit more force to throw that much water?
[47:36.34]This is a little less painful.
[47:40.34]We got, wait, no, not yet.
[47:44.18]Not yet.
[47:44.68]Holds more water too, so that is a good thing.
[48:06.55]I gotta spend all this time going back and forth between the different plants, you know what I'm saying?
[48:16.54]Dude, you should watch TV.
[48:18.90]Should I watch TV?
[48:20.18]TV rots your brain.
[48:31.04]I mean, my energy seems like it's... No, don't do that.
[48:37.46]It looks like it's kind of the same.
[48:39.54]Maybe like 10% better on the energy front.
[48:50.34]Maybe not even.
[48:51.02]Alright, we got it.
[48:56.56]We're all watered up.
[48:58.44]Hey, dog!
[49:02.20]Here.
[49:03.44]Look, I can go so far with this now.
[49:06.88]We get out of the way.
[49:08.82]Ready?
[49:09.16]Downtown.
[49:09.74]From downtown.
[49:10.36]Oh, look at that!
[49:16.59]Alright, uh, back to bed.
[49:19.85]Finished watering the plants.
[49:21.29]What is that noise?
[49:24.91]Is somebody, like, munching on my crops?
[49:27.87]You heard that, right?
[49:31.78]What the hell was that?
[49:34.22]Is that his tail?
[49:38.26]Why does your tail sound like a drill?
[49:39.76]Where's your good boy?
[49:43.34]Okay.
[49:51.33]Um, but is anything coming up?
[49:53.25]I got some Geodudes.
[49:58.11]New video when?
[49:58.77]Tomorrow?
[50:00.52]Tomorrow evening.
[50:04.20]Should be done by then.
[50:08.23]Oh, whoops, I forgot to do this.
[50:12.17]Guy wants a copper bar.
[50:14.61]I'll do it.
[50:15.25]I have another one.
[50:15.83]Do I have it in my inventory?
[50:18.09]No.
[50:19.45]I'll go get it.
[50:21.39]Okay, Gus.
[50:29.35]There are other ways of restoring energy.
[50:30.63]Yeah, you can go to the spa.
[50:34.36]I know that.
[50:38.35]You know what I mean?
[50:38.89]I know that.
[50:41.23]I know this.
[50:51.05]Someone told me to watch TV.
[50:53.15]Okay, uh, weather report.
[50:55.87]Your number one source for weather news and now the weather forecast for tomorrow.
[50:58.97]It's going to be clear and sunny.
[51:00.37]Oh, that's great.
[51:01.81]Living off the land.
[51:04.04]Welcome to living off the land.
[51:05.30]We're back again with another tip for y'all.
[51:06.76]Now listen up.
[51:08.31]Most towns have a seasonal calendar in front of the general store.
[51:11.60]It's a good idea to check on that now and then to get a feel for what's going on in the community.
[51:17.44]What an awful TV show.
[51:19.60]That's the whole TV show.
[51:25.62]Ah, yes, I can hear the spirits whispering.
[51:27.68]The spirits are mildly pertubed today.
[51:29.86]Lucky will it be on your side.
[51:31.42]Oh, no.
[51:32.12]These are tiny little short TV shows.
[51:34.20]Where's the GTA Grand Theft Auto style full TV networks?
[51:39.33]Come on, developers.
[51:45.39]You can get recipes from CV.
[51:46.39]That's cool.
[51:47.93]Okay.
[51:49.49]I'm going to eat this sack of shit.
[51:53.61]Mmm, spicy berry.
[52:01.05]Copper bar.
[52:02.48]Let's go.
[52:07.81]I do a lot of slouching when I play this game.
[52:11.35]Anybody else do that when they play this?
[52:12.65]Just slouch?
[52:18.89]Something about this one in particular.
[52:20.55]I don't know what it is.
[52:22.59]But man, do I roll my shoulders forward and lean forward and like tuck my chin into my neck.
[52:30.32]It's not healthy at all.
[52:33.60]I gotta sit up.
[52:35.76]Get better posture.
[52:37.46]No wonder my back hurts.
[52:41.04]Oh, a Gus.
[52:42.88]Is Gus the blacksmith, or is he... He's the blacksmith, right?
[52:52.76]Is Gus the blacksmith?
[52:53.60]Or is this Clint?
[52:58.68]All you guys have... Yeah, it's Clint.
[53:00.18]All you guys have dumbass names.
[53:06.40]Clint's a cool name.
[53:09.62]Gus is not the chef?
[53:15.63]Why can I not go in this door?
[53:16.85]What the fuck?
[53:21.82]Oh, he's the guy at the bar.
[53:22.86]Oh yeah, this guy's blocked off.
[53:24.98]Captain Crunch can't be talked to.
[53:26.34]Okay, to the bar.
[53:41.52]I just said Clint's a cool name.
[53:45.91]But I mean, like, take a look at this name.
[53:49.15]Uh, Evelyn's like... Evelyn's kind of a cool name.
[53:53.17]Evelyn's like not a bad name.
[53:54.67]That's kind of... That's a good name.
[53:56.81]That would just your way.
[53:57.51]Look at this guy's name.
[54:01.16]This guy.
[54:01.66]There you are.
[54:03.80]Hey, Gus!
[54:05.50]Where do I put it?
[54:11.79]How do I give this to you?
[54:14.33]Should I just hand it to him?
[54:16.25]I guess.
[54:18.87]Oh, you saw the bulletin I posted.
[54:20.59]I really appreciate it.
[54:21.73]I'm so happy.
[54:22.45]I'm just shaking everywhere.
[54:24.86]Look at him.
[54:29.04]He was shaking so much.
[54:31.62]Did he pay me?
[54:36.57]He didn't pay me.
[54:37.23]Oh, no.
[54:37.53]I have to click this.
[54:41.52]Okay, Gus, what do you feel?
[54:42.92]What are your feelings on me now?
[54:47.94]I would love to talk to you.
[54:57.49]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[55:00.93]We did it at the same exact time.
[55:04.89]I actually make that noise.
[55:07.96]Hey, Frozen Crazy Tuna, thanks for subbing.
[55:10.52]I can't believe we just did it at the same time.
[55:14.32]I was going, uh, what do I want here?
[55:16.50]Uh, thanks for subbing.
[55:23.16]That was perfect timing.
[55:24.38]I don't know how that happened, but it did.
[55:28.57]What if I buy one of these?
[55:29.33]Like, omelette recipe?
[55:30.33]Like, hash browns?
[55:31.17]Pancakes?
[55:33.17]Tortilla?
[55:34.69]They're not that expensive.
[55:42.67]I mean, just for the sake of it, I'm just gonna buy... Oh, coffee.
[55:47.08]Um... See, I'm gonna give somebody a cup of coffee.
[55:50.02]Pancakes.
[55:52.54]We're gonna get pancakes.
[55:54.46]Where'd it go?
[55:55.68]Do I just automatically learn it?
[55:56.66]Huh?
[56:04.53]Um... Huh?
[56:10.61]Huh?
[56:14.16]Do I need like a stove or something?
[56:18.14]Mayonnaise machine.
[56:18.96]I don't even have any eggs.
[56:23.64]God, this is a disaster.
[56:29.15]There's too many things to do in this game.
[56:38.91]I'm wasting money again.
[56:39.77]It was like 250 bucks.
[56:42.28]You see my cash flow?
[56:43.18]I got a huge cash flow.
[56:48.71]Good job, you... Yeah, I just like rubbed the recipe all over my face.
[56:56.37]I'm gonna do one of these.
[56:58.56]What do I need for one of those?
[57:06.28]Okay, um... Summer.
[57:09.96]Grape, sweet pea.
[57:11.34]I already had like two of these.
[57:16.83]Oh.
[57:17.17]Okay, well I have the grape.
[57:19.13]Spicy berries and tulips.
[57:20.71]Uh, sweet peas.
[57:21.91]I'm gonna go get those.
[57:23.73]Fuck you, buddy.
[57:25.05]See ya.
[57:30.91]Okay, who can I steal a sweet pea from?
[57:38.99]Let me take care of this for you.
[57:46.94]Draconi, Draconi.
[57:49.86]Welcome.
[57:50.36]Thanks for something.
[57:53.64]Hope you enjoy your stay.
[57:58.28]Uh, there's one.
[57:58.92]And then I just need a berry.
[58:02.31]And I deposit it at the community center.
[58:06.61]Let's get a spicy berry.
[58:08.84]What's this?
[58:10.34]Ice cream.
[58:11.06]Give me one.
[58:12.12]Give me two.
[58:13.28]Give me three.
[58:16.50]Where are they?
[58:17.69]Oh.
[58:20.23]Dude.
[58:21.61]I got three ice cream cones.
[58:25.35]It's hard to find someone that doesn't like this.
[58:29.42]Who do I want to be my friend?
[58:34.66]You know who I'm giving the ice cream cone to?
[58:41.52]You'll see.
[58:45.32]Obvious Ninja.
[58:47.54]Welcome aboard.
[58:50.61]Welcome aboard.
[58:53.17]Thanks for subbing.
[58:53.65]Appreciate it.
[58:56.87]Have fun on this coaster.
[59:00.87]You know who's getting this ice cream?
[59:06.96]Wouldn't you like to know?
[59:18.73]Wouldn't you like to know?
[59:22.13]Hey, buddy.
[59:24.67]I've got something for you.
[59:26.91]It's an ice cream cone.
[59:30.53]This is a great gift.
[59:31.69]Thank you.
[59:32.21]You're very lucky.
[59:32.87]Want another one?
[59:37.91]See?
[59:38.73]He loved it.
[59:39.33]Okay, how much does he like me?
[59:44.20]What?
[59:44.52]Zero out of ten?
[59:50.24]Look, I even made you fire for you.
[59:52.30]Let's chat.
[59:53.92]You know?
[59:55.00]Just two guys... shared an ice cream cone and having a quick chat.
[60:02.21]How are things?
[60:03.91]I'm giving him an ice cream cone every day.
[60:06.45]You are getting an ice cream cone for three days straight.
[60:08.75]If you don't like me after that, I'm going to throw you into the river.
[60:14.10]That was dark.
[60:23.69]Grapes.
[60:24.39]What do I need?
[60:24.75]The sweet berry?
[60:26.07]Spicy berry?
[60:26.67]There's another one of those.
[60:37.27]I need a berry.
[60:40.73]A sweet berry.
[60:48.68]I feel like I saw those over here.
[60:55.48]There's another one of these.
[60:57.44]That was a golden berry.
[61:04.15]Come on.
[61:08.19]Come on, where's my spicy berry?
[61:17.60]I like this comment.
[61:18.88]Are you mods good people or do you delete the loot get and we are the rats messages?
[61:26.45]That's a very important thing to know.
[61:28.57]I don't see any.
[61:43.18]Come on, I need a sweet berry.
[61:46.60]Where are my sweet berries?
[61:49.72]Look, look, look, I knew, I knew, I knew this one over here.
[61:53.22]Spicy berry.
[61:54.26]Nice.
[61:55.93]Let's go to the community center.
[61:57.13]Let's deposit it.
[62:09.26]I had a... Yeah, I know I ate that spicy berry.
[62:11.28]I had one before, but I didn't know I needed one.
[62:15.34]See, now if I go to the community center, I can deposit these three.
[62:19.70]Where the hell is it?
[62:20.90]I forget.
[62:23.10]Is it right here?
[62:23.58]Yeah, it's right here.
[62:28.91]Rats.
[62:29.67]We're rats.
[62:30.85]We're the rats.
[62:32.65]We pray at night.
[62:33.57]We stalk at night.
[62:34.69]We're the rats.
[62:37.11]I'm the giant rat.
[62:38.93]Where do you deposit these?
[62:41.87]Down here?
[62:44.39]Hello!
[62:46.35]I've got something special for you.
[62:48.17]Oh, that's a good one, too.
[62:51.63]What do I get?
[62:57.17]What do I get?
[62:57.61]What do I get?
[63:01.52]What is it?
[63:08.34]Holy shit.
[63:10.04]30?
[63:10.06]30 seeds?
[63:11.94]Oh my god.
[63:12.76]Oh, look at this.
[63:16.90]I have a carrot.
[63:25.06]Fuck.
[63:26.80]Whoa, whoa.
[63:29.09]There's another one?
[63:32.77]Oh, it's showing me all the unlockables!
[63:40.66]Oh!
[63:47.62]Oh, cool.
[63:50.10]Oh, cool.
[63:52.12]Blueberry, melon.
[63:56.13]How is there this much stuff to do in this game?
[64:01.87]Fish tank, lake fish bundle, crab pot bundle, night fish bundle.
[64:07.46]Oh, I want to do this.
[64:08.32]I want to complete the coal quest.
[64:12.82]Ocean fish.
[64:14.44]Sardine, tuna, red snapper, tilapia.
[64:20.52]Oh, man.
[64:22.10]Let's do this one.
[64:23.64]I'm going to get a sardine, a tuna, a red snapper, and a tilapia.
[64:28.66]But I can't...
[64:34.52]I had a ghost fish.
[64:40.40]But these are like different seasons.
[64:45.63]Get me out of here.
[64:48.15]Get me out of here.
[64:48.85]I'm leaving.
[64:53.39]Leave this place.
[64:56.55]Tilapia?
[64:56.99]Tilapia is really good.
[65:00.48]What's going on?
[65:05.75]What is this guy doing?
[65:06.79]That's my job.
[65:11.09]What is this cutscene?
[65:15.63]Filthy varmints, those raccoons are back.
[65:21.76]Ah, you turned up at the right moment, son.
[65:23.84]Could you do an old man a favor?
[65:25.04]Could you go around the corner and scare off those raccoons for me?
[65:27.92]They've been causing a real mess.
[65:30.53]Make sure you give them a good scare so they never come- No!
[65:35.60]That's my friend.
[65:36.20]I'm going to give him another ice cream cone.
[65:42.32]It was me.
[65:43.40]I'm sorry.
[65:48.67]I find a lot of hot, fresh food in these cans.
[65:50.97]Stuff that will go to waste if I don't take it.
[65:53.75]Take it.
[65:55.61]Fuck this guy.
[65:57.61]He threw away a half-eaten burrito?
[65:59.22]Fuck him.
[66:00.34]You think there's something wrong with what I'm doing?
[66:01.84]Are you serious?
[66:04.20]No, it's a shame.
[66:04.84]It's a shame.
[66:11.08]I feel good about what I'm doing.
[66:12.38]I'm not harming anyone.
[66:13.36]If somebody throws away a half-eaten piece of pizza, they didn't want it.
[66:18.24]Come on.
[66:19.78]As long as, by the way, Linus, as long as you're not taking credit card statements, you're just eating half-eaten burritos, whatever, you know?
[66:32.07]You can go home.
[66:32.77]I promise I won't rummage in this can anymore.
[66:35.31]Tell them you scared off the raccoons for good.
[66:41.86]He's my one friend.
[66:45.70]What are you going to get out of this one?
[66:46.84]Do I have to come to his defense again?
[66:50.42]Oh, damn it.
[66:54.39]He saw me.
[66:56.83]I know what you were doing, Linus.
[67:01.67]If you need food, just ask.
[67:02.79]I don't want anyone in Pelican Town to go hungry.
[67:05.83]This is a good guy.
[67:06.49]Here, I've got a basket of zucchini fritters for you.
[67:10.39]Just make sure... Ew.
[67:14.32]Just make sure you dip them in my spicy marinara.
[67:16.70]Zucchini fritters.
[67:17.66]Yeah, I gave him an ice cream cone.
[67:28.16]And now we're like good friends.
[67:33.62]I'm going to date that guy.
[67:35.04]Me and the hermit are going to be like lovers.
[67:37.84]Just you wait.
[67:48.01]I don't care.
[67:48.43]If my one friend is the hermit, I'm cool with that.
[67:56.93]I'm slouching again.
[67:58.92]I keep catching myself.
[68:00.08]Just slumped over.
[68:02.54]Why does this game do this to me?
[68:05.84]Why do I do this?
[68:06.88]This is the only game I do it with.
[68:10.98]I almost want to turn the webcam on so you guys can see it happen in real time.
[68:15.12]But no, it's embarrassing.
[68:16.16]It's like gross.
[68:17.80]I'm like... Yeah, we're going to be dumpster buddies.
[68:38.15]Did I already water these?
[68:40.29]Did I water my stuff today?
[68:41.67]I think so.
[68:43.59]Well, if I didn't, I didn't.
[68:44.95]Whatever.
[68:45.23]Do I have anything I can sell?
[68:50.27]No.
[68:58.66]No, no face cam.
[69:01.08]We have lots of work to do.
[69:02.30]I'm not turning on a face cam.
[69:05.84]Absolutely not.
[69:07.04]Absolutely not.
[69:16.23]Just fire up a dog.
[69:17.23]The dog is kind of just sleeping over here with his little turtle friend.
[69:20.13]He's got a big stuffed turtle that he sleeps with.
[69:26.20]His name is Mr. Turtle.
[69:36.89]Gotta get that right.
[69:58.14]This farm... Hey, come on, give me a break.
[70:01.12]This farm looks extremely well laid out.
[70:05.30]I'm not a farmer.
[70:10.43]You don't like my zigzag here?
[70:11.61]Eventually there's gonna be a fence.
[70:15.07]No, see, what you're looking at is over on the right, and I agree with you.
[70:17.47]This looks like shit.
[70:19.59]And this needs to be redone, too.
[70:22.55]Once the crops from this are here, I'm chopping these down.
[70:27.83]Alright, fellas, ladies and fellas.
[70:33.23]Guys and dolls.
[70:35.41]We've got a, uh... We've got 30 plants to plant.
[70:42.63]We've got a bunch of strawberries or something.
[70:53.67]No, the turtle's name is Mr. Turtle.
[71:05.78]Okay.
[71:10.80]Shit.
[71:12.14]I need 30 spaces.
[71:17.30]Um...
[71:21.86]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
[71:23.90]Damn it.
[71:24.60]Hold on.
[71:24.92]1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24.
[71:25.30]Ah!
[71:51.28]Sometimes you just gotta move around a little bit.
[71:53.58]Okay.
[71:56.91]Get out of here.
[71:58.67]Get this out of here.
[71:59.57]I don't care.
[72:02.63]They can go right here.
[72:03.39]They'll go like over this way.
[72:06.93]Because I'm moving this.
[72:07.87]This is getting the fuck out of here.
[72:14.41]We're cleaning this up, guys.
[72:25.41]Yep, there are a couple of sacrifices that have to be made.
[72:30.11]Sacrifice.
[72:32.37]Sacrifice.
[72:32.97]Okay.
[72:41.55]This looks like shit.
[72:43.81]We're redoing our plan.
[72:53.37]Yeah, sacrifice.
[72:56.52]How long do these take?
[73:01.02]How do I look at it?
[73:02.52]Look at them.
[73:05.86]Assortment of summer seeds.
[73:09.86]How many times?
[73:10.36]I guess seven days?
[73:11.26]Yeah, I'm gonna have to hold on to these.
[73:22.53]Yep.
[73:23.63]Some of them might be longer.
[73:28.38]Now I'll just store them.
[73:32.08]I got a lot of junk in here.
[73:34.80]Why do I have these?
[73:35.90]Acorns and pine cones?
[73:37.04]What a turd.
[73:40.24]Who keeps nine pine cones in a box in their house for no reason?
[73:50.29]Yeah, I'm going to just wait for next year.
[73:54.69]So, I'm just going to leave this as is.
[73:56.99]Hopefully these... Is the corn going to be done in the next few days?
[74:00.41]I hope so.
[74:02.67]Oh, alright.
[74:04.93]Back to bed.
[74:16.48]Okay.
[74:17.34]Hey, look at this.
[74:17.86]We got another pepper season.
[74:19.90]Oh, awesome.
[74:32.02]So what happens to these when they go down?
[74:34.42]Do I lose the plant?
[74:36.06]I'm assuming I do.
[74:41.26]Oh, here comes the corn.
[74:42.28]Here comes the corn.
[74:43.14]Look it.
[74:43.48]Can you see the corn sticking up?
[74:46.02]God, that just makes me so just full of energy seeing the corn husks come up like that.
[74:52.58]I don't know what it is.
[74:57.20]What's with this one?
[74:58.68]What's going on with this one right here?
[75:01.76]That one doesn't seem to be growing at the same rate.
[75:04.30]I think we've got a couple of duds.
[75:20.82]I'm not allowed to use the spot anymore.
[75:23.60]After I died in it.
[75:27.78]This is also corn, huh?
[75:31.35]I think these are melons.
[75:33.45]I'm fairly certain that's what they are.
[75:39.13]Alrighty.
[75:40.63]We are all watered up.
[75:43.55]Ice cream.
[75:45.12]Deliver the ice cream to you-know-who.
[75:52.34]Birthday stream.
[75:53.88]Well, Doggy H. Can we get a happy birthday in the chat, please?
[76:03.22]Can we get a happy birthday in the chat to Doggy H?
[76:11.80]Oh god, that says... I probably shouldn't have said that.
[76:17.95]I can sell these.
[76:20.55]I am slouching.
[76:22.47]Pimping chicken.
[76:23.95]I am slouching.
[76:24.75]You got me.
[76:25.23]You don't even need the camera.
[76:28.43]You got me already.
[76:34.14]Alright, what the hell am I doing?
[76:34.94]Oh yeah, give him the ice cream.
[76:42.86]Who else's birthday is today?
[76:44.18]Can we get a happy birthday for them too?
[76:49.50]Happy birthday to everybody.
[76:50.42]Alright, where is he?
[76:52.58]Hello, oh there he is.
[76:55.85]I brought you something.
[76:57.21]It's a little treat.
[77:00.35]This is a great gift, thank you.
[77:03.21]What?
[77:07.11]No way.
[77:12.25]How does he still not like me?
[77:13.75]What the fuck?
[77:18.39]I covered for your ass when you were digging through the trash.
[77:32.11]I was a real buddy to you there, man.
[77:36.94]Get rid of this.
[77:37.38]I don't want this shit.
[77:38.14]Get off my screen.
[77:41.38]Okay.
[77:41.96]Sell the peppers.
[77:48.23]Our romance with Linus is not going well.
[77:51.79]Time to throw him into the river.
[77:52.89]No.
[77:53.69]Three ice cream.
[77:55.41]Do what I said.
[77:57.23]It's well and settled.
[77:58.17]He has to die.
[77:58.97]No.
[78:09.05]Hey, did you did you not like hey?
[78:11.31]I you know I've given you two ice cream cones Over the last couple of days.
[78:15.85]Are you not my best friend?
[78:17.20]Well?
[78:17.80]It's time for you to die That's I don't know that makes me giggle No, that makes me giggle in ways in ways you don't know Can I ride this thing?
[78:31.81]Come on, I wanna get on the playground
[78:36.69]Who else can I give an ice cream cone to?
[78:38.33]What am I doing now?
[78:39.51]I only have like a few days till the summer's over.
[78:44.49]I'll go to- I'll sell these peppers.
[78:51.11]What's the quest?
[78:56.68]What a fucking weirdo.
[79:00.12]This is such bullshit.
[79:02.22]This is the biggest lie I've ever seen in my life.
[79:05.05]I need a topaz to rub on my sore tooth.
[79:07.91]Bring one to me as soon as possible.
[79:09.94]I'll give you like a couple hundred gold for it.
[79:13.12]Yeah, right.
[79:14.18]She's lying, so somebody brings her a topaz so then she can sell it for like 500 gold.
[79:18.78]What an awful lie that is.
[79:20.74]Come up with something else.
[79:21.54]Come up with something at least somewhat interesting and somewhat believable.
[79:28.65]You're not getting shit from me.
[79:29.85]It's on Wednesdays.
[79:38.40]Hey, farm guy.
[79:39.20]Got a question for you.
[79:40.98]Hey, when I turn pro, can you say you were my first fan?
[79:43.42]Not bad, huh?
[79:44.10]I never said I was a fan of yours.
[79:48.62]You want an ice cream cone?
[79:51.06]No, you don't deserve it.
[79:53.06]That's Henry's ice cream cone.
[79:54.31]Who's the hermit?
[79:54.79]What's his name?
[80:01.99]Where do I want to go?
[80:04.76]I don't know what to do.
[80:05.48]Back to bed.
[80:07.34]It's Wednesday.
[80:08.06]I can't do anything.
[80:12.94]Yeah, back to bed.
[80:14.32]There's nobody even in here either.
[80:23.26]Yeah, I'm going to bed.
[80:29.76]Oh, I bought the ice cream from him.
[80:33.76]Make a sprinkler?
[80:34.40]It's too late for a sprinkler.
[80:36.84]We're going by hand watering can with a steel watering can.
[80:46.68]It sure is Elliot.
[80:53.16]Yeah, that's really interesting.
[80:54.44]Does anybody... This morning I accidentally stepped on a bug.
[80:59.49]Oh, that's too bad.
[81:02.89]Why are they having bubbles now?
[81:11.92]I wasn't even trying to do that.
[81:15.08]At least use your energy to chop down trees.
[81:17.40]No, I refuse.
[81:20.14]I know what I can do.
[81:24.11]Let's get some eggs or something.
[81:26.21]How much does this cost?
[81:29.45]Purchase animals.
[81:33.12]Construction of a big coop.
[81:34.68]Who does the construction?
[81:35.56]Alright, who does the actual construction?
[81:45.35]And how much is it?
[81:53.03]Where am I?
[81:53.65]I'm becoming Linus?
[81:59.70]Yeah, I kind of am.
[82:04.05]She turned into a real... Stop overgrowing my fucking farm!
[82:13.16]You're making me say all kinds of swear words.
[82:16.96]Hold on.
[82:18.22]Gonna throw these in the dumpster.
[82:41.47]How would this ice cream not be melted by now?
[82:43.27]Back to bed.
[82:52.91]That's a lot of cash.
[83:00.12]Let's just say you can't afford it, Pepper Boy.
[83:02.24]Hey, I'm soon gonna be Corn Boy.
[83:07.23]Very soon, you're gonna see me get a lot of money as Corn Boy.
[83:16.49]weather permitting.
[83:24.54]Slouch alarm.
[83:25.58]No, not this time.
[83:26.36]Not this time.
[83:26.96]You didn't get me.
[83:29.62]You didn't catch me this time, guys.
[83:32.52]I'm not slouching.
[83:36.26]I'm the laziest video game player.
[83:37.94]What?
[83:39.40]What do you mean?
[83:39.86]What are you talking about?
[83:41.42]Look it.
[83:43.10]I'm walking around watering.
[83:44.46]By hand.
[83:46.09]If I had sprinklers, you could say that.
[83:47.41]I'm doing this all by hand.
[83:53.41]Are these going to give me another harvest?
[83:56.07]It's four days, right?
[83:57.24]Yeah, they will.
[83:59.04]They should at least.
[84:00.38]Two more days.
[84:00.90]I kind of just want to go back to bed.
[84:11.76]I hate when it gets to the end of a season because I can't plant anything.
[84:16.23]They can't really do anything besides just sleep.
[84:18.67]Oh, shit.
[84:23.41]Corn goes through the fall.
[84:24.37]That's right, it does.
[84:25.55]But these don't.
[84:27.90]And these are... not done.
[84:30.46]Doggie H!
[84:31.30]Doggie H, thanks for something, dude.
[84:33.90]Is that the birthday boy?
[84:35.06]Is that the birthday boy?
[84:45.42]Yeah, thanks.
[84:45.82]Thanks for subbing.
[84:48.45]Happy birthday.
[84:51.21]Again.
[84:53.61]How can these not be ready?
[84:56.01]These radishes, whatever the hell they are.
[85:00.57]Oh, itching my eyes.
[85:01.73]Hold on a second.
[85:03.87]How come every time you itch your eyes...
[85:06.87]you push your chin down and you open your mouth and make a frown and you have this kind of open mouth like with your like tongue kind of pushed out a little why do we do that as humans there's no reason to do that face my knees acting up again and I know what helps rubbing the darn thing with hot pepper where was this mail yesterday
[85:34.14]Why do these people rub food all over their bodies?
[85:41.87]Go take medicine.
[85:45.25]There's a hospital right down the street.
[85:48.19]Go get some Tylenol.
[85:51.79]Everybody wants to rub shit all over their bodies in this game.
[85:55.00]Hey, do you have a melanin?
[85:55.98]I kind of need to rub that all over my ass.
[85:58.12]Oh, you know what?
[85:58.58]My knee's acting up.
[85:59.46]Give me a hot pepper.
[86:00.22]My teeth hurt.
[86:01.06]Can you give me some fucking rocks to chew on?
[86:04.74]People are idiots.
[86:05.40]I'm gonna get your fucking hopes up.
[86:10.94]How many days?
[86:18.89]Well, he'll get one eventually.
[86:22.72]If everyone wants to... Why do... Why does everybody want to rub food all over themselves?
[86:29.56]Wait, what the hell is that?
[86:33.88]Those are worms.
[86:35.14]Can I get those?
[86:37.90]Probably, but who are we?
[86:40.24]Who cares?
[86:40.54]If you want to think that they ate it, they're not eating them.
[86:58.15]Anything fall in here yet?
[87:02.13]Does he sell things for fall or only for summer?
[87:05.13]Yeah, summer.
[87:08.23]Does anything here last into the fall?
[87:12.85]Summer, summer.
[87:14.85]Summer.
[87:16.26]Summer.
[87:18.56]Summer.
[87:20.14]Summer.
[87:22.68]Summer.
[87:23.04]Summer.
[87:25.26]Summer.
[87:30.06]Yeah, I'm full.
[87:31.30]Yeah.
[87:33.12]Yeah, paper.
[87:40.59]Shimmer.
[87:43.25]There's fruit in the swing.
[87:46.77]In the center.
[87:47.51]Fingers.
[87:48.41]Fingers.
[87:50.41]Fingers.
[87:50.93]Fruit in the fall.
[87:52.15]Okay.
[87:52.35]Fingers.
[87:52.73]Fruit in the fall too.
[87:56.69]Wow.
[88:05.00]Oh, I can't do anything.
[88:05.78]Let's go.
[88:10.24]Fucking slouch, I know, really.
[88:13.38]If I know how to use a sword, I would be exploring those caves by the mountain lake right now.
[88:17.18]It's probably nice and cool in there.
[88:20.44]Merry Christmas!
[88:31.07]Uh... Ice cream.
[88:39.59]Alright, guys.
[88:42.65]Ice cream.
[88:47.23]You know who it's going to.
[88:49.75]Did I spend a thousand gold, pretty much?
[88:51.89]Like, 700 gold?
[88:55.96]To give the hermit three ice cream cones and to cover his ass.
[89:00.54]Here.
[89:02.70]Oh, shit.
[89:03.02]I can't give him anything else.
[89:07.00]Hmm.
[89:07.22]Do you want something from me?
[89:09.36]I just wanna hang out.
[89:10.04]I just wanna hang out, dude.
[89:14.36]And I want you to tell me all your secrets so I can know what to buy you.
[89:27.90]Can I please talk to you again?
[89:28.94]I can't even talk to him again.
[89:42.70]At least we get some berries.
[89:46.32]Seems dangerous to balance ice cream on your head like that.
[89:48.54]It actually does seem pretty dangerous.
[89:52.77]Oh, what the hell?
[89:55.41]Okay, wooden sap.
[90:01.01]Thanks for wasting my time, Linus.
[90:02.91]Came all the way over here.
[90:13.08]food therapy is supposed to be internal if you eat blueberries the antioxidants and free radicals and stuff that's why you eat blueberries you don't squish them and rub them all over your balls
[90:41.67]When am I going to highlight that doll running into the wall?
[90:47.49]Well, I started working on something else.
[90:49.81]Because it was sort of point A to point B, point B to point C. With a video that I had been working on.
[91:00.13]I had been working on this video for probably two weeks.
[91:06.00]But certain things had to happen before I was able to upload this video that's uploading tomorrow.
[91:12.51]So I kind of got sidetracked with something else.
[91:18.27]What was that?
[91:19.02]Why did I come back here?
[91:20.50]I completely forget what I was doing in the game.
[91:24.24]Oh, right.
[91:24.78]Okay.
[91:27.52]How much wood do I have?
[91:29.98]And sap.
[91:30.51]I need a little bit more sap, probably.
[91:36.99]Can I eat this?
[91:56.98]Torch.
[91:59.64]I'm gonna need more than four.
[92:00.68]Gonna have to chop down a couple more trees.
[92:16.70]Here we go.
[92:17.40]No, it is not.
[92:27.17]It is not.
[92:27.65]It's not Jerm or Rumble 4.
[92:31.21]That's not going to be for another couple months.
[92:32.61]I have a lot of wood.
[92:41.60]Can I just make something with this wood?
[92:43.04]I feel I have too much of it.
[92:51.16]Minecraft?
[92:51.90]It's not a Minecraft video.
[93:00.29]I think I can get away with 12.
[93:01.60]Eh, let's go with 15.
[93:02.62]15's probably safer.
[93:19.40]Throw a bomb in the middle of this mess.
[93:20.84]I could do that, but I don't think I have one.
[93:29.40]That should be good.
[93:30.26]Yeah, 18.
[93:34.26]That's good enough.
[93:38.11]Why am I not using the steel sword?
[93:40.47]Because I got this.
[93:43.93]Which is like three or four times more damage than the steel sword.
[93:47.45]And I got that
[93:49.45]I got that like in-game hours, like probably 10 hours ago.
[93:52.33]I got that so early on.
[93:57.97]Let's put this stuff away.
[94:04.72]Got some food.
[94:07.10]Should be able to... Back to bed?
[94:20.52]Raining.
[94:20.98]Are these ready?
[94:21.53]I can't believe these are not ready.
[94:24.75]But thank god I don't have to water.
[94:27.13]I love rain.
[94:28.49]Thanks, rain.
[94:28.97]I can hear a frog.
[94:39.01]You've gotten to the bottom of the mine, maxed out fishing, and you still haven't found the trident.
[94:43.87]This really might be like one of the best items in the game.
[94:48.01]I accidentally found one of the best weapons in the game.
[94:52.10]At least for the first like 10 to 20 hours of the game.
[94:56.82]On accident.
[94:57.26]I just was fishing in a random part of the lake.
[95:08.94]Screw you, wizard.
[95:11.70]Let's just go.
[95:12.50]Losing time.
[95:15.28]That's why it's broken.
[95:18.04]I guess so.
[95:24.90]Trident's mid-level.
[95:28.40]Well, for whatever it is, I got that at the very beginning of the game.
[95:36.72]Am I going to make a video on this game?
[95:38.03]No.
[95:39.98]Probably not.
[95:42.90]Actually, I have, like, a lineup of videos that are being made.
[95:47.01]I have the one that's coming out tomorrow.
[95:49.55]I have, like, another one, like, that I'm working on.
[95:51.51]There's, like, three videos that I'm, like, working on.
[95:55.21]But they're not gonna be out for, like, a little while.
[95:57.17]But the one's coming out tomorrow.
[96:03.04]Am I ever gonna sell Twitch shirts?
[96:05.44]No.
[96:07.18]I don't think so.
[96:09.32]If I'm going to do a t-shirt, I'm going to do my own t-shirt campaign on Teespring.
[96:12.38]Let's put one down.
[96:25.27]That is not a lot of light.
[96:27.41]In fact, that is very little light.
[96:29.37]I'm surprised at actually how few that... how many tiles that's not lighting up.
[97:07.20]I don't even need to plant it.
[97:08.04]I can just carry them around.
[97:10.30]I mean, technically, right?
[97:17.34]If I just want to get to 40, I don't need to really... Yeah, that's easy.
[97:22.67]Who needs to put them on the ground?
[97:36.60]Do I still have my TF2 server?
[97:38.70]I do not.
[97:40.14]That's been gone for a long time now.
[97:43.04]Almost more than a year.
[97:55.97]I don't feel like carrying it.
[98:14.55]Stab him in the corner.
[98:15.53]Can't go anywhere.
[98:16.68]Where's he gonna go?
[98:25.32]Am I at 34?
[98:26.12]Almost at 35.
[98:26.72]We're getting there.
[98:29.56]Getting close.
[98:43.54]Kill the zombie.
[98:50.08]I get enough iron to make an iron bar.
[98:52.12]I think it's five, right?
[98:54.40]Or at least it should be.
[98:56.32]It should be.
[99:01.56]It's a dirty carrot.
[99:05.91]You bet me $10,000 you ate more eggs than me today.
[99:10.83]I would... Yeah, you probably have.
[99:12.31]You know why?
[99:12.69]Because I haven't eaten any eggs today.
[99:14.75]Not today.
[99:23.34]40s coming up real soon I'm definitely gonna get to 40 hey whoa whoa Why can I put this down?
[99:52.93]Put it down.
[99:53.45]That was really odd.
[100:02.27]36.
[100:19.55]How's my niece doing?
[100:20.80]Or is it nephew?
[100:21.38]I have a niece and a nephew.
[100:23.99]They're both doing fantastic.
[100:25.71]Thank you for asking.
[100:37.70]Yeah, Tuesday afternoon stream.
[100:38.84]I like that.
[100:39.72]You know what?
[100:40.00]When it becomes a little bit nicer outside, it's going to be nice just to stream and just have my window open over here.
[100:46.60]It's going to be a nice breeze.
[100:52.91]Let's keep going.
[101:01.22]How's Otto?
[101:01.70]He's really good.
[101:04.41]Speaking of Otto, I need to give him his medicine.
[101:06.35]In like an hour or two.
[101:15.07]He takes steroids.
[101:19.95]Because of his Addison's disease.
[101:24.40]He takes steroids every single day.
[101:27.12]For the rest of his life.
[101:28.12]Ooh, quartz.
[101:37.71]So close to 40.
[101:41.59]Is 40 the very bottom?
[101:42.55]How far does a mine go?
[101:43.43]100 or something?
[101:47.03]What the hell was that?
[101:55.56]Did you see that?
[101:56.00]That was like a weird glow over here.
[101:59.77]I gotta be careful.
[102:00.39]I'm running out of torches.
[102:03.07]I should probably just pick these up and bring them with me at this point, because I don't want to run out if I already know where I'm going.
[102:14.08]Can I do anything with the minecart?
[102:15.77]I swear to God, it was like, you can use the minecart sometimes, Sonny.
[102:38.16]Ooh!
[102:39.08]Look, I got an Omnigeo dude, guys.
[102:40.90]Maybe I'll get five stone from it.
[102:43.32]Wouldn't that be fun?
[102:48.74]So instead of rolling the dice... How much is it just to sell that straight up to the vendor?
[103:01.01]I need to eat a carrot.
[103:01.81]Mmm!
[103:11.36]One more and we're at 39.
[103:12.66]We're at 40.
[103:17.42]Right there.
[103:17.82]Let's make sure there's nothing here.
[103:18.84]Make sure there's nothing interesting down the rest of this cave.
[103:26.99]Doesn't look like it.
[103:28.57]40.
[103:28.69]We made it.
[103:30.86]We did it!
[103:31.80]We got to 40!
[103:35.42]We're over the hill.
[103:36.18]Officially, I'm yawning.
[103:38.08]I'm sorry.
[103:38.78]I just yawned.
[103:40.14]A chest.
[103:45.82]Reach the bottom of the mine.
[103:49.47]Holy shit, there's more.
[103:50.73]What's in the chest?
[103:54.47]Is it a slingshot?
[103:56.97]Holy shit, I can turn into Bart Simpson?
[104:03.39]Okay.
[104:04.33]Well, let's go down to 41.
[104:08.07]Jackpot.
[104:10.45]Jackpot.
[104:12.83]What?
[104:14.33]Can I not... Am I doing this wrong?
[104:17.55]Do I need a different tool?
[104:29.28]Kind of look like Bart Simpson now that I think about it.
[104:39.31]You can shoot people in the town with a slingshot.
[104:42.32]What am I, Dennis the Menace?
[104:52.04]Still getting regular stones.
[104:54.51]Shouldn't I be getting... I'm not even getting ore out of these.
[104:59.09]Something's not right.
[105:02.23]Something ain't right here.
[105:18.52]No, I don't have much time left.
[105:25.91]Might be able to get to 45.
[105:26.69]And then I have to take the... road back up.
[105:35.90]Here we go, new ore.
[105:36.76]Is this iron?
[105:38.96]Nice!
[105:42.20]Oh, yeah.
[105:43.30]Look at this gold mine of iron.
[105:45.44]Look at this gold mine.
[105:48.28]I'm so glad I went down another.
[105:49.36]Because now I'm getting a ton of iron.
[105:59.51]Nice.
[106:01.55]Nice.
[106:07.11]You're a tough slime.
[106:17.34]I'm running out of air.
[106:17.90]I gotta go.
[106:18.26]I'm not gonna get to 45.
[106:21.02]The only way I get to 45 is if I go... Ooh, another piece of funfetti cake.
[106:29.37]I know iron's not gold, but you can turn iron into gold.
[106:33.07]All you need is a magician.
[106:39.17]Slouching again.
[106:43.31]Alright, I gotta immediately jade.
[106:51.63]Come on.
[106:55.49]Give me the way down.
[106:56.39]Do I have anything?
[106:58.14]Can I eat anything?
[107:01.56]Club?
[107:03.56]Still not as good.
[107:07.72]Still not as good as the trident.
[107:11.26]Can I eat the bug meat?
[107:12.88]No.
[107:14.09]I gotta go.
[107:16.15]Yeah.
[107:17.69]I know I'm right there, but
[107:21.51]Come on!
[107:24.84]Come on!
[107:29.08]Come on, get me... just... right here.
[107:33.04]Fuck!
[107:33.86]No!
[107:39.03]Damn it!
[107:46.17]It's... I gotta go.
[107:47.67]There's no...
[107:55.17]Go, get up, get up, leave the mine.
[108:01.95]45 almost, but it's okay.
[108:05.26]I just don't want to run out of energy and pass out.
[108:06.86]Wait, I can craft a staircase?
[108:13.44]What do you mean craft a staircase?
[108:22.97]It's always a good time to leave.
[108:24.79]It's alright.
[108:32.14]Let me just back up.
[108:35.02]Do a stretch.
[108:37.28]Alright, where am I running to?
[108:38.18]That scared me.
[108:48.93]It always scares me.
[108:52.67]Wait, it's a gray square thing?
[108:57.34]Stone fence?
[108:58.46]Iron fence?
[109:01.90]Staircase.
[109:02.44]You just have to move down a level in the... I didn't even know this existed!
[109:11.93]That scene... That doesn't make any sense!
[109:16.25]I'm just gonna make a, uh... I'm just gonna make a staircase down.
[109:20.37]Is this Binding of Isaac?
[109:28.94]This doesn't look like a staircase.
[109:30.38]This looks like a toaster oven.
[109:34.63]When somebody says, hey, build the staircase.
[109:36.53]I'm like staircase.
[109:37.59]I didn't think you meant like the easy bake oven in the middle of my screen.
[109:40.43]99 stone.
[109:48.10]Yeah, that is a lot.
[109:58.63]back to bed wait do I know sell some things bug meat uh bat wings oh wow that is a ton of stone that it would take like I want to keep the jade slime uh
[110:25.82]Keep the rest.
[110:26.68]I mean, I could sell these, but just keep them.
[110:30.42]I'm gonna end up needing them soon, I would assume.
[110:32.71]Alright, Geodudes.
[110:42.91]I got so much trash in here.
[110:45.31]Is my ice cream coming?
[110:49.81]A frozen Geodude.
[110:51.05]I got a lot of Geodudes to open.
[111:13.26]I'll donate this.
[111:22.13]Back to bed.
[111:24.39]Plus 5 HP.
[111:25.17]New cooking recipe.
[111:26.11]Roots Platter.
[111:29.99]Okay.
[111:30.15]Okay.
[111:35.44]Damn, what was all that?
[111:37.80]Oh, bat wings.
[111:40.84]That's a pretty good return.
[111:42.82]Those bat wings are a good return on investment.
[111:50.41]Yeah, I'm having some back problems.
[111:51.77]Can you... Uh-oh.
[111:54.31]Hey, Greg.
[111:54.81]I have some good news for you.
[111:55.95]A few days ago, I made a breakthrough with my research on local environment.
[111:59.78]I'll spare you the technical details and get to the point.
[112:02.46]You know that empty cave over there a little ways to the west?
[112:04.92]Well, I have a way to turn it into something useful.
[112:07.64]For both of us.
[112:09.08]I like to set up the cave to attract local species.
[112:11.79]That way I can observe them in more control.
[112:13.51]Get to the point, Dimitri.
[112:16.73]Oh, this is the point.
[112:18.73]I'd like you to set up...
[112:24.33]I'd like to set up the cave to attract some local species.
[112:30.93]That way, I can observe them in a more controlled environment, and you can harvest whatever products they produce.
[112:36.04]I can either set up the cave to attract mushrooms or fruit bats.
[112:42.60]You want me to have a bunch of bats?
[112:47.92]I want bats or mushrooms.
[112:53.36]I don't know, Dimitri.
[112:54.76]I don't know.
[112:58.72]Do you need an answer right now?
[113:05.47]Fine.
[113:05.81]Bats.
[113:08.99]The Bat Cave.
[113:12.17]Alright!
[113:12.93]I'll go set it up for you right now!
[113:14.65]It shouldn't take any time at all!
[113:16.93]Thanks for letting me do this!
[113:20.63]Yeah, you're welcome.
[113:24.06]I'm getting concerned about these, by the way.
[113:26.02]Because they're still not ready.
[113:29.97]I'm getting concerned about these also, because there's really only like three days.
[113:36.73]Huge mistake?
[113:37.46]What do you mean, huge mistake?
[113:41.00]Game over?
[113:41.66]What?
[113:42.30]Restart?
[113:42.70]What?
[113:42.90]What are you talking about?
[113:46.46]That gives free bats.
[114:02.66]I'm going to the blacksmith.
[114:03.50]Can't the blacksmith, like, break these down?
[114:05.14]Let's go.
[114:17.51]Drugs are better than bats.
[114:19.67]Wait, is that what he wanted me to do?
[114:23.87]Was he, uh... Was he looking for a front for his drug business?
[114:26.63]Is that what he was doing?
[114:28.88]Oh, you selected bats.
[114:29.92]Shit.
[114:30.40]I thought you were gonna let me grow drugs in a cave.
[114:33.24]It's okay, though.
[114:33.80]I'll go get the bats.
[114:47.40]Hey, you blew it.
[114:48.40]That's not right.
[114:56.59]I want this thing out of my front lawn, though.
[114:59.05]Stupid meteorite.
[115:00.01]I'm looking like all this shit.
[115:03.04]Okay, easy.
[115:06.76]Easy with that.
[115:07.42]I almost just chopped down some stuff.
[115:29.16]Whatever happened to the mayonnaise plants?
[115:31.80]Yeah, they kind of fell through.
[115:33.46]That's what I do.
[115:37.64]I come up with these big schemes and big plans.
[115:41.51]And then I just don't do them.
[115:48.85]You get sidetracked and more important stuff happens.
[115:51.01]Like you become the corn master.
[115:55.57]Started as a mayonnaise plant and then I became the corn master.
[116:00.70]Very easy to explain.
[116:07.92]I missed the mayonnaise stream.
[116:10.64]There never was a mayonnaise stream.
[116:24.35]Nightbot's drunk.
[116:25.25]He always is drunk.
[116:32.21]Nightpaw comes in here shit-faced at least two times a week.
[116:35.73]I don't want to see this guy.
[116:39.86]I want to go get my Geodudes and... Is it the blacksmith that breaks down old equipment?
[116:53.70]In my heart there was a mayonnaise stream.
[116:55.40]Yeah, there you go.
[117:05.01]Hello.
[117:07.00]I would like for you to process some Geodudes.
[117:10.28]The frozen one.
[117:10.86]Here we go.
[117:14.04]Blueberry pie.
[117:14.56]That's a drum.
[117:17.24]I'm going to save those two for last.
[117:22.71]Iron ore.
[117:25.47]Pinky ring.
[117:28.59]Shitty.
[117:31.35]And a green sun.
[117:34.26]Here we go.
[117:34.79]Come on.
[117:35.21]Something good.
[117:37.15]Ooh.
[117:39.23]Fire quartz.
[117:41.37]Oh!
[117:43.03]And a dolomite.
[117:47.42]Thanks, man.
[117:51.74]What do I... How do I get rid of these?
[117:56.04]Wasn't somebody saying that I could break these down somewhere?
[118:02.51]Jerma, I get the whole solar system emote joke, but this is a complete waste of good emotes.
[118:07.41]I mean, is it though?
[118:19.83]You can put them in the box.
[118:20.69]Can you put them in the box?
[118:23.10]Okay.
[118:25.16]Well, what does it take to make the steel thing?
[118:35.56]Steel pickaxe.
[118:37.64]I think I can do this.
[118:40.12]Can I finally get rid of the fucking thing in my front lawn?
[118:46.32]I have enough iron to make five bars, I think.
[118:48.39]I have like 30.
[119:00.55]Let's go donate these things.
[119:14.14]Oh, but this stuff is expensive.
[119:18.20]Whatever.
[119:18.64]Let's go.
[119:21.54]Let's see what the reward is.
[119:22.38]Ooh.
[119:29.20]Starfruit seeds.
[119:34.00]That's all you're gonna give me?
[119:35.06]You're gonna give me one starfruit seed?
[119:39.32]You shitting me, dude?
[119:41.26]Are those crazy expensive or something?
[119:48.81]Another reward.
[119:53.21]Oh, and they give you, like, a summoning portal.
[119:56.95]Standing Geodude?
[120:01.54]It's just furniture?
[120:06.72]What about the green sun?
[120:10.18]Or the dolomite cap?
[120:17.17]Mr. Squishy?
[120:22.31]Thanks for subbing, Mr. Squishy.
[120:25.47]Welcome.
[120:31.68]I want to go to the Adventurers Guild.
[120:34.16]Isn't that up here?
[120:35.30]It's like up there.
[120:43.69]So why would I get one starfruit?
[120:48.47]Seems a little odd.
[120:51.87]That's next on the list, making an animal coop.
[120:59.15]I could donate the drum, too.
[121:02.37]I honestly said blueberry pie.
[121:06.13]And then when I got to the point where I could donate it, I actually thought it was just a blueberry pie.
[121:09.86]So I just thought I could eat it or something in the mine.
[121:12.18]I just forgot.
[121:28.36]How many hours do I have on this game?
[121:30.84]I don't know.
[121:31.38]I've streamed every single second of this game that I've played.
[121:36.02]I have not played this game one second off stream.
[121:39.95]Only on stream.
[121:40.81]So, however long I've streamed the game is, I guess, how many hours I have.
[121:43.81]I haven't looked.
[121:44.25]Are you gonna talk to me yet?
[121:52.22]I'm happy by myself.
[121:54.82]Goddamn.
[121:58.18]Still 0 out of 10.
[122:00.60]That is so depressing.
[122:03.10]Where's the cave that that guy was talking about, by the way?
[122:12.25]2 p.m.
[122:13.33]I can wait.
[122:26.33]Give him the shoes.
[122:28.60]They don't... You can't... These aren't like gifts.
[122:30.92]I wish I could give them to people.
[122:32.74]See how they don't appear over your head?
[122:33.94]Let me make sure I... These are... One defense, one immunity.
[122:45.84]One defense, one immunity.
[122:50.74]Why did I find all the better equipment, mid-level equipment, in the first 30 minutes I played the game?
[123:05.92]Gila, wake up!
[123:06.50]We have a visitor!
[123:08.48]Here we go.
[123:10.06]Yeah, just... This is all trash.
[123:11.54]Just get rid of it.
[123:15.66]How much is this worth?
[123:16.42]It's worth a lot.
[123:18.36]But what do you have?
[123:19.30]Let's see.
[123:19.66]8 to 15.
[123:21.73]8 to 14.
[123:21.89]9 to 17.
[123:21.99]15 to 24.
[123:22.23]2 speed and 3 weight.
[123:37.65]Jade ring.
[123:40.69]Is this thing still better?
[123:41.85]15 to 26.
[123:44.63]It's still better.
[123:50.25]I mean, this has, like, speed, but who cares?
[123:57.61]Cutlass, but I do more damage anyways, and who cares about speed?
[124:01.05]I could buy these.
[124:06.35]Plus three defense, but I don't get the immunity.
[124:15.13]No, it's not worth it.
[124:17.57]How come that says +2 speed and this just says two speed?
[124:21.25]Is that just like an error in the code?
[124:23.77]I'm gonna assume.
[124:30.38]So like technically this is a little bit better, I guess.
[124:37.25]But I'm not dropping two.
[124:38.23]I already have.
[124:39.03]If I can use this still, why would I drop two grand?
[124:43.97]That's a stupid idea.
[124:44.89]Okay, well, whatever.
[124:55.06]I got rid of the junk.
[125:00.41]Alright, let's donate the blueberry pie.
[125:05.32]I'm going to go all the way back down here.
[125:06.82]4pm, are they closed?
[125:07.92]They will be soon.
[125:08.82]No, it's not.
[125:12.86]Wait.
[125:15.40]Can't I repair this or something?
[125:18.36]Or is that a different bridge?
[125:25.76]You're on floor 80 and you still haven't upgraded your tools?
[125:28.70]Damn.
[125:35.00]I gotta go make some... whatever the hell it is, the steel pickaxe stuff.
[125:41.08]Watch out for the gas!
[125:44.04]I don't need new friends.
[125:45.18]This guy doesn't even want to be friends with anyone.
[125:47.50]Why am I trying to... You know what?
[125:48.54]Fuck this.
[125:48.90]I'm giving the ice cream to this girl.
[125:49.96]Hey, how'd you know I was hungry?
[125:54.54]This looks delicious.
[125:55.92]Hey, thanks.
[125:57.20]You can't miss tomorrow's festival.
[125:58.56]It's one of the most beautiful wonders of the valley.
[126:04.38]What festival?
[126:08.08]Is it a festival tomorrow?
[126:09.24]Okay.
[126:10.14]Make sure I don't sleep through that one.
[126:19.26]Can I get to the museum in time?
[126:21.25]Definitely not.
[126:29.85]No, absolutely not.
[126:33.13]Am I gonna have to haul ass?
[126:34.10]340.
[126:36.06]No, no way.
[126:36.58]I'll do it tomorrow.
[126:48.06]Oh, now Nightbat... Nightbat.
[126:50.20]Now Nightbat wants to work.
[126:57.67]I'm getting concerned here.
[127:00.22]I'm scared that those crops aren't going to be up, at least the corn.
[127:03.46]I know it can grow into the fall, but it doesn't take 14 days.
[127:07.83]So if it goes 14 into the... If it goes like three or four days into the fall, that means I might only get one harvest in the fall.
[127:19.71]Back to bed.
[127:34.46]What's happening today?
[127:36.72]Yes, I got another harvest of peppers.
[127:39.08]And I can give this guy to the freak that's going to rub it on his ass.
[127:44.78]I got a big harvest today.
[127:46.66]Big harvest.
[127:49.15]So should I just cut these down?
[127:52.69]If they're not going to produce anything.
[127:54.43]I'll just wait it out.
[128:03.34]Yeah, look at this.
[128:04.74]Oh, big melons.
[128:11.79]Those were some melons.
[128:14.15]This corn over here is so stupid.
[128:15.57]There's really no reason for me to do this.
[128:26.47]Because I'm not going to get another harvest.
[128:27.97]But I'm kind of just obsessive compulsive and have to do it.
[128:39.61]Uh, these peppers were the best idea I've had all game.
[128:45.36]They are responsible for all of the progress I've made so far.
[128:49.28]Legit.
[128:50.72]Every single ounce of progress that I have done in this entire game has been because of those chili peppers.
[128:56.68]That's it.
[128:58.90]All of my mistakes, all the dumb things I've done, have all been negated because of that crop up there.
[129:06.66]God, summer was a good time.
[129:07.99]Summer was a good month.
[129:12.05]Made all kinds of cash in the summer.
[129:13.57]Yeah, fall is going to be the animal month.
[129:24.94]We're going to recalibrate our efforts in the fall.
[129:29.60]I'm talking chickens, cows, monkeys.
[129:35.29]Whatever I can buy.
[129:41.45]Dear Greg, tonight at around 10 o'clock p.m., a rare and beautiful little day place, the Moonlight Jellies, will be passing by Pelican Town on their long journey south for the winter.
[129:50.86]We're all gathering at the beach to watch.
[129:52.40]You don't want to miss this.
[129:53.48]See you tonight.
[129:54.40]Dimitri.
[129:56.64]Okay.
[129:59.79]One guy wanted a pepper, so we'll bring that pepper to him and we'll sell the rest.
[130:09.55]Didn't somebody want a melon, too?
[130:11.09]Oh, fuck it.
[130:11.57]Who cares?
[130:11.95]Give me the money.
[130:17.49]Although, I can place this, though.
[130:19.24]I can place this here.
[130:20.88]My summoning portal.
[130:28.20]I don't understand.
[130:29.08]Oh.
[130:32.96]This is stupid.
[130:36.98]I don't even want this.
[130:42.38]Can I sell this?
[130:43.84]I hate this.
[130:48.37]I really don't like that at all.
[130:57.29]Well.
[130:59.79]Time to go donate this to the museum.
[131:02.01]And then go to the... I'm going to go fishing.
[131:04.13]I haven't done that in a while.
[131:13.60]Have not gone fishing for a while.
[131:17.41]Look what we got.
[131:18.07]We're already prepared for the summer.
[131:20.23]Somewhat.
[131:21.49]Got plenty of materials.
[131:25.57]Got plenty of fishing, uh... Fishing quills.
[131:31.26]We're almost done with summer fish, so might as well try to get some, right?
[131:39.94]She blinded me with science!
[131:48.51]You know, I'm just gonna go down to the beach and fish until bedtime.
[131:56.13]Eat this.
[132:00.71]Uh, yeah.
[132:01.86]Wait, wait, who wanted this?
[132:02.96]The pepper?
[132:04.94]That's important.
[132:08.78]George.
[132:09.48]Who is George?
[132:11.66]Oh, George is the old guy, right?
[132:14.16]One of the old guys?
[132:15.24]Not that one.
[132:16.76]Wait, where do they live?
[132:19.78]Not this house.
[132:22.54]It's the guy that was yelling at the hermit for going in the trash can.
[132:27.70]Where does he live?
[132:35.15]Is it this house?
[132:38.53]No.
[132:40.25]It's the one above it.
[132:44.23]It's like over here, right?
[132:48.01]Yeah, it's this one right here.
[132:55.25]Where is he?
[132:58.97]I'm trying to give him the hot pepper.
[133:00.49]Where's your husband?
[133:07.07]God damn.
[133:14.99]George.
[133:20.48]Where could you possibly be right now?
[133:26.56]George.
[133:29.99]George.
[133:30.63]I'm coming for you, George.
[133:40.08]I'll wrap back around.
[133:41.00]I gotta donate this.
[133:53.43]Can I go this way?
[133:54.75]Yeah.
[133:56.27]Wait.
[133:58.97]Yes.
[134:01.25]Stop getting stuck on rocks.
[134:05.33]Go to the church.
[134:06.93]Ah, too far away.
[134:08.59]Plus, when I walk in the church, it, like, burns me.
[134:10.53]I have to walk out.
[134:12.47]Hey, there's your blueberry pie.
[134:19.22]Reward.
[134:20.22]Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[134:24.08]Drum block?
[134:28.38]What is this?
[134:28.92]I don't understand.
[134:34.33]What does this do?
[134:39.25]Okay, well... Gimme it.
[134:46.51]Did I just actually place this here and I can't get it back?
[134:56.66]I can't pick it up.
[134:58.60]I just want to see what it did.
[134:59.64]Hold on a second.
[135:15.72]Okay.
[135:18.60]Got it.
[135:32.41]What?
[135:34.35]Where did it go?
[135:35.27]Did she take it?
[135:39.51]Where's my drum?
[135:43.87]She got pissed off and she grabbed it.
[135:46.07]Hey, get back here with my drum set.
[135:49.73]She actually took it.
[135:51.59]I didn't give that to her.
[136:05.10]I wanted to show her my sick drum solo.
[136:07.44]She didn't care for it.
[136:08.42]I'll throw hot coffee in her face.
[136:13.28]Oh, she liked it.
[136:21.54]What was I doing?
[136:25.76]It fell in the water?
[136:26.70]No, it didn't.
[136:27.32]No way.
[136:34.08]I forget what button it is on the controller.
[136:35.54]Okay, it's X. Reset.
[136:50.40]No, I don't give a shit about the drum.
[136:54.14]I was gonna play with that for another five minutes and then put it in a shelf and never touch it again.
[137:06.82]Now, if you tell me I could sell that thing for, like, a thousand gold, then maybe I would be more inclined.
[137:21.57]I wish I could get it back.
[137:24.80]This used to be a drumstream.
[137:27.88]Cheshire!
[137:28.92]Get it!
[137:29.14]Oh, fuck!
[137:33.32]Whoa!
[137:34.16]Whoa, look at these reactions!
[137:35.56]Whoa!
[137:35.78]Whoa!
[137:41.42]I'll get it.
[137:41.76]Give me that.
[137:46.14]Sick!
[137:47.76]Nice!
[137:54.83]And... Bait!
[137:58.65]That I don't even know how to use.
[138:07.83]Just smash her with the drum.
[138:09.61]You guys are dark.
[138:11.49]Somebody say, just take the drum and you... What a dark chat.
[138:24.70]What?
[138:26.28]Mother catch?
[138:31.54]Oh no.
[138:32.00]Got them stuck inside of each other.
[138:35.68]He didn't like that very much at all.
[138:46.33]I'm not using the bait.
[138:48.11]Because I don't think I can.
[138:49.25]Don't I need a better fishing pole?
[139:03.56]Oh, my glasses!
[139:14.94]The drums are a symbol of love.
[139:16.84]Hopefully he'll snare her as a mate.
[139:19.78]Nobody likes me.
[139:20.34]None of these people like me.
[139:23.70]Even the trash man doesn't like me.
[139:25.14]And I did a lot.
[139:26.91]I bent over backwards for him.
[139:33.19]Metaphorically speaking.
[139:58.60]I'm just fishing here.
[139:59.52]Easy.
[140:00.57]Easy.
[140:00.81]Yeah, I'm slouching too.
[140:10.07]I gotta stop slouching.
[140:12.65]I'm doing a little too many slouches.
[140:29.76]Okay, it started to get a little bit darker in the game, and I thought it was getting dark in my house.
[140:33.45]I was like, oh, jeez.
[140:37.97]Am I light dimming?
[140:39.65]What's going on?
[140:47.39]I'll go to the... It's 10 p.m.
[140:49.85]We've got plenty of time.
[140:52.29]I'll catch, like, two more fish.
[140:55.55]And then go from here.
[140:59.04]Give everybody a fraction of my harvest.
[141:01.72]I kind of already do that, don't I?
[141:03.26]Don't I sell the crops to everybody?
[141:13.43]This is real life.
[141:21.87]Trash.
[141:23.08]Alright, last one.
[141:24.64]Last one and we make our way to the beach.
[141:38.92]Come on.
[141:42.08]Come on.
[141:43.04]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me something, give me something.
[141:46.28]No, that's not enough.
[141:48.58]Just, I don't, throw, I threw it back in.
[141:52.82]You know, I have a real catch and release policy.
[141:55.19]Let's throw it back in where it came from.
[142:00.59]Well, okay.
[142:08.60]Yeah, the festival starts at 10 p.m.
[142:10.72]It's a late one.
[142:17.40]We got a hit.
[142:19.28]This is a wild one.
[142:22.36]We got a wild one here, boys and girls.
[142:24.08]26-inch.
[142:30.47]Here we go.
[142:32.23]Festival.
[142:44.84]Make sure to swing by the shop tomorrow to get your fall seeds.
[142:47.66]Oh.
[142:50.04]These candles are romantic, aren't they?
[142:53.10]Sure.
[142:53.34]I remember seeing the jellies once as a little girl.
[142:58.73]Oh, how I jump with joy.
[142:59.91]Why are you looking at me like that?
[143:02.93]You think I'm too old to enjoy something like this?
[143:04.71]I have something for you.
[143:07.47]I'll give it to you sometime.
[143:11.82]Bye to the mosquitoes.
[143:14.57]So is everyone just like staring into the water with candles in the water and reminiscing of the last 30 days?
[143:22.40]I'll just sneak up when the jellies arrive.
[143:24.28]I don't want to bother anyone.
[143:25.32]Will you just come hang out with me?
[143:27.92]Look, we can walk together.
[143:30.96]Let's go.
[143:39.02]Anything over here?
[143:41.31]I don't think so.
[143:46.06]There are people here.
[143:51.60]Where are they?
[143:52.38]Can I catch them?
[143:58.68]Can I throw my fishing line and grab one and sell it?
[144:01.42]I'm going to go in the water.
[144:14.06]How do I get out of this?
[144:19.37]I'm done.
[144:21.85]Can I see the jellyfish and then go home, please?
[144:28.43]That's a heavy load of people for an ancient wooden dock.
[144:32.10]That guy thinks the whole thing's gonna crash down.
[144:38.46]Okay.
[144:44.74]Who's gonna launch the boat?
[144:46.82]You, Willy?
[144:56.63]I don't care.
[144:57.07]I want my special shoes tonight!
[145:00.33]If we keep polluting the oceans, the jellies will surely go extinct.
[145:06.41]Well, I accidentally threw a newspaper in there.
[145:17.50]I should have brought my camera.
[145:18.62]I always forget.
[145:19.40]Oh, that's too bad.
[145:23.04]Snap a picture with your iPhone.
[145:26.64]Okay, well there's the boat right there.
[145:27.80]I'm gonna push the boat in.
[145:33.89]Can't I just shove the boat?
[145:39.13]Is there anybody that I didn't see?
[145:40.61]That doesn't matter.
[145:44.25]Everyone's telling me to go to the bush creep.
[145:47.54]Where's their bush creep?
[145:50.72]I mean, he is just up there.
[145:53.61]There's no bush creep?
[145:54.53]What are you guys talking about?
[145:55.51]There's no guy in the bushes.
[146:10.12]She just said, don't tell Gus, but I'm disappointed there's no buffet.
[146:13.00]He's standing right next to her.
[146:16.52]Probably heard that.
[146:19.40]Over on the other side, on the beach?
[146:24.80]I already talked to this guy.
[146:25.80]I mean, up here?
[146:30.74]Oh, wow, there really is a bush creep up here.
[146:36.29]It's the wizard.
[146:36.87]Okay, well, that was worth it.
[146:53.75]I didn't even see him.
[146:56.02]He was being a really good creep.
[146:57.24]I didn't even know he was there.
[147:02.14]Okay.
[147:05.04]It's time to launch the boat into the sea.
[147:08.29]Let's... Oh, look it.
[147:09.41]Here come the jellyfish.
[147:11.79]Can't wait.
[147:20.87]Alright, is this when we throw a grenade into the water when they all gather?
[147:24.47]And we have a feast for like a whole three weeks?
[147:36.31]Oh, I'm speechless.
[147:39.58]Oh, wow.
[147:45.12]Look at that one!
[147:48.18]That one over on the left is dancing!
[147:56.18]Well, sometimes you have to stop and take a look at the little- Look at the babies!
[148:00.24]Oh, mom, mom!
[148:01.12]Look, babies!
[148:01.94]Mom!
[148:14.65]What's going on with that one?
[148:15.65]Dude, look at that one!
[148:16.22]Look at the one on the right!
[148:18.62]Is that the mother brain?
[148:20.56]Is that the one that can speak English?
[148:21.84]Let's see.
[148:24.52]No...
[148:27.14]Somebody just wrote, shut up, Jerma.
[148:31.03]What, am I ruining your moment here with the jellyfish in the water?
[148:36.73]It's going to get cold.
[148:37.33]They're all going to die.
[148:38.84]The water gets really cold in the fall.
[148:41.20]They all die.
[148:42.62]Sorry to spoil you.
[148:48.74]See?
[148:49.56]The glow of summer has faded now, and the moonlight jerrys carry on toward the great unknown.
[148:54.96]You guys know what the great unknown is?
[148:56.24]The great unknown is like, like, kaput, you know?
[149:00.82]Dead.
[149:18.99]Back to bed!
[149:24.58]Let's see what I got for those.
[149:27.64]Ooh!
[149:30.18]Ay-yi-yi!
[149:31.94]These melons!
[149:38.61]Those are worth a ton.
[149:40.83]Can you imagine if you got more than one?
[149:44.87]Man, if I got all gold.
[149:47.19]That's so much money.
[149:53.27]Now I got a lot of money.
[150:02.56]85 hundo.
[150:06.02]Summoning portal.
[150:07.20]Hold on a second, guys.
[150:08.00]I need two more of you guys to come over here.
[150:11.20]Because one of my friends is in the barrens.
[150:13.77]And we need to do the dead mines.
[150:16.31]So can somebody come over here real quick?
[150:20.07]Join the party.
[150:20.55]I'll give you 10 gold.
[150:22.65]Thanks.
[150:26.07]Wow jokes.
[150:29.63]Okay, that scared me for a second.
[150:33.45]Yeah, that scared me for just a second.
[150:36.87]I should be able to... Yeah.
[150:39.89]These can go.
[150:42.66]We're planting something else here.
[150:48.86]Yeah, I'm slouching.
[150:51.72]I've accepted my slouch.
[150:54.92]The French...

[151:27.61]Oh my god.
[151:31.80]What the hell?
[151:33.28]Why do I have to go like this?
[151:34.50]Okay, that was stupid.
[151:37.60]That was really stupid.
[151:44.00]And now I'm gonna miss one, because it threw me off.
[151:46.48]I can't go sideways.
[151:50.32]Hey, remember the thing that I spent all the money on?
[151:52.84]I literally cannot use its function.
[151:57.12]I cannot do the function.
[151:59.02]I have to do one by one.
[152:00.38]No, it doesn't even matter.
[152:00.98]I have to go from top to bottom.
[152:02.84]Nope, it still doesn't work.
[152:05.09]Okay, that just watered behind me.
[152:07.45]It's watering behind me.
[152:20.93]I wasn't having this problem before.
[152:25.44]Move my mouse.
[152:25.94]My mouse is not even... I'm using my controller.
[152:35.05]Why did that matter?
[152:37.19]That doesn't make any sense.
[152:38.09]I'm using the controller.
[152:39.95]The mouse was disappeared from the screen.
[152:42.99]Delete the game.
[152:43.79]That's defective.
[152:53.47]I'll make sure I get everything.
[152:54.69]That was a catastrophe.
[152:58.41]Did I get them all?
[152:59.51]Yeah, I did.
[153:01.47]Yeah, I got them all.
[153:05.56]Alright, let's patch that up.
[153:08.12]Get... How many are here?
[153:09.74]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20.
[153:11.80]Okay, there are 30 here.
[153:13.06]So I can do...
[153:19.98]Do I have any plants that I can put in in the fall?
[153:23.34]These are summer seeds, so no.
[153:27.02]Still have to give that to the dude in the knee issue.
[153:31.41]Summer, so these, no.
[153:32.77]These can just stay in here.
[153:35.91]I got a lot of bullshit.
[153:37.11]I gotta get rid of this bullshit.
[153:41.47]Hold on a second.
[153:44.06]Let me just get rid of this bullshit.
[153:47.00]We are doing a full cleanup here, guys.
[153:51.52]We're doing a clean up.
[153:59.82]And when I say clean up, I mean a legit clean up.
[154:04.46]We are trashing most of the stuff to get ready for the fall.
[154:09.98]Like, for instance, goodbye.
[154:11.03]I don't even know what this is.
[154:12.89]Goodbye.
[154:13.31]Goodbye.
[154:13.69]I'll plant these.
[154:16.05]I'll eat this.
[154:16.69]I'll eat that.
[154:19.33]Get rid of this.
[154:22.55]Uh, sweet pea, just whatever.
[154:24.71]Make a new path.
[154:29.57]Sell these.
[154:32.23]Okay.
[154:33.35]We're doing a major cleanup.
[154:36.50]Now you're not back to bed.
[154:37.18]No, I'm kidding.
[154:40.12]Uh, Earth crystal.
[154:46.28]I just, I don't even want to look at it anymore.
[154:48.06]I don't care about any of this.
[154:51.87]I don't care about any of these things.
[155:01.94]I'm just going to put the campfire over here.
[155:04.66]Just, you know, here.
[155:06.62]Look.
[155:06.88]Oh, campfire.
[155:09.32]Nice.
[155:09.70]Interesting.
[155:10.20]Cool.
[155:11.98]Okay.
[155:12.36]I don't want to cause a forest fire or anything.
[155:14.44]Okay.
[155:17.06]I need a hoe.
[155:25.31]And away we go.
[155:35.14]Now I need fertilizer.
[155:38.30]I need sap.
[156:00.58]You heard I never read chat.
[156:01.92]I read chat all the damn time.
[156:08.49]I would say most of the time I'm looking over at chat.
[156:12.59]You know what I mean?
[156:17.05]You really can hear the slouching.
[156:18.49]How am I already exhausted?
[156:23.00]Back to bed.
[156:27.94]No.
[156:28.90]Yeah, back to bed.
[156:30.46]No.
[156:31.68]No.
[156:33.59]No.
[156:35.99]Not yet.
[156:41.37]First I want to plow.
[156:43.86]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[156:45.06]Don't, don't.
[156:57.47]Gotta go to the spa.

[157:18.13]Mmm.
[157:27.32]I haven't checked out the cave.
[157:28.38]There's a lot of things I haven't done.
[157:30.90]Add it to the list.
[157:33.55]What is he doing here?
[157:42.17]Yeah.
[157:44.48]One out of ten.

[157:47.64]We are getting there, guys.
[157:50.23]He just barely despises me, you know?
[157:54.15]One of the 10.
[157:55.47]You give something a one of the 10 as like a joke that you hate it.
[157:58.77]So, you know, making some progress.
[158:01.91]Making progress.
[158:04.78]Yeah, did he think the bathhouse was a cave?
[158:12.78]Alright.
[158:14.04]Time for nudity.
[158:37.07]one out of ten he acknowledges that you exist yeah I know really how depressing hey Otto you want some you want to take your medicine my little dog okay let's go alright back to bed
[159:06.72]What if he walks in right now?
[159:07.78]I wish he would.
[159:08.40]That would be fun.
[159:15.46]He's gone.
[159:17.52]He's just gone.
[159:18.33]Okay, what was the task?
[159:25.27]This is what happens.
[159:25.91]I just forget everything.
[159:29.05]I was going to buy seeds.
[159:32.57]Get a bunch of sap.
[159:36.82]Maybe I should... Should I just spend money?
[159:38.66]Just get a bunch of good fertilizer?
[159:41.35]I mean, I got 8,500.
[159:43.81]You know?
[159:45.83]If you got 8,500, you might as well... Bank it, right?
[159:50.39]What do I get to lose?
[159:50.95]I got a big... I got a big corn crop coming.
[159:52.53]What, are you kidding me, guys?
[159:54.81]I got a huge corn on the crop coming.
[159:57.53]Where am I going?
[160:00.45]When you have that much corn on the crop... What do you think?
[160:04.81]I'm not... I think I'm not gonna sell it?
[160:06.62]for like a shit ton of money?
[160:08.45]You guys are crazy.
[160:13.57]Hey, Farmer Greg, pumpkin seeds.
[160:15.13]Oh, pumpkins, 13 days.
[160:19.92]This corn, eggplant.
[160:22.44]Should we just get a bunch of eggplant?
[160:24.12]Bok choy, yams, cranberries.
[160:31.51]I kind of want cranberries.
[160:42.33]Alright, we're either doing an absolute dickload of eggplants, or we're going to split it between pumpkins and yams.
[161:05.40]Now, it's a bad idea.
[161:06.60]It's a bad idea.
[161:06.96]I'm not going to be able to water them in time.
[161:16.10]200 cranberries.
[161:17.92]No, not cranberries.
[161:18.60]Eggplants.
[161:19.14]Cranberries.
[161:21.14]We doing cranberries?
[161:24.89]You got it.
[161:30.41]Cranberry seeds.
[161:31.93]I'm just buying up the whole store.
[161:33.99]You guys ready for this one?
[161:34.85]35 cranberries.
[161:42.21]Come at me.
[161:46.03]Oh shit, I wanted to, hold on.
[161:50.85]Does he even have it?
[161:52.98]No, I can make that shit.
[162:01.78]Made 60,000 from cranberries.
[162:05.56]And now I'm broke?
[162:06.46]No, no, no, no, no, wait, hold on a second.
[162:07.85]Before everybody freaks out, do you know that I have like 50 corn on the cobs to sell in like a day?
[162:14.93]I have like 50 corn on the cobs.
[162:21.27]I'm going to probably make like $5,000 to $10,000 from the corn on the cob.
[162:25.49]Look at how many I have.
[162:28.08]Like this is an insane amount.
[162:29.32]This is like 40 corn on the cobs.
[162:33.62]And it's taken like almost 15 days to produce this.
[162:36.98]It's taken me like two or three days of in-game time to have this happen.
[162:44.08]So we're just gonna make, we're gonna make this a nice fertilized soil here.
[162:48.42]We're doing 30 sap.
[162:56.29]And things are gonna be alright.
[163:02.29]Clean up the farm a little bit.
[163:08.43]Get rid of these logs, get rid of these shit logs.
[163:11.72]They don't, they have no place on my farm.
[163:21.41]I need a better axe.
[163:23.62]Yeah, I do.
[163:24.02]But whatever.
[163:43.71]Sip.
[163:50.75]Hit it.
[163:53.02]Hit it!
[163:56.92]Tell me why I should play this?
[163:59.44]I mean, I can't... I can't tell you to do or do... You do whatever you want.
[164:03.25]If you think it looks like you're gonna have fun playing this game, I highly recommend it.
[164:06.45]If you like games where you just simulate and chop down trees and sell crops to people and have hobos spit in your face after you give them food and help them after they were digging through the trash, you're a 1 out of 10 to this person.
[164:24.05]I'd say get it then.
[164:26.35]It's pretty cheap too.
[164:26.97]The game's not that expensive for the amount of time that you have in the game.
[164:30.99]What is it?
[164:31.55]15 bucks?
[164:34.47]I'll say for $15, right?
[164:36.12]Let's just go by price per amount of time in game.
[164:41.12]I've played lots of games that were more than 20 to $25 that were less than like two to three hours of game time.
[164:50.04]So if you figure
[164:54.32]That's... You'll be spending a lot of time in this game for the money.
[165:01.96]If you enjoy this type of thing, that is.
[165:06.33]Now, if you get in this game and you chop a tree down and you go, this sucked, this is so boring, why did I do this?
[165:11.93]I can't help you there.
[165:20.93]Okay, back to bed.
[165:23.08]How many fertilizers do I have?
[165:32.26]20.
[165:32.28]Not quite what I need.
[165:36.34]Back to bed.
[165:45.49]Oh man.
[165:50.49]These are actually, I could walk around and just pick these things up.
[165:55.42]I didn't, I just didn't, I didn't expect to get that much money.
[165:57.70]I guess I, yeah, I trashed a lot of garbage, huh?
[166:01.62]Acorns are worth that much?
[166:04.42]Okay.
[166:09.40]I'm not going to plant my things until I have 30 soil fertilizers.
[166:13.31]Corn time.
[166:21.49]corn time.
[166:22.66]Almost corn time.
[166:23.46]I need ten more.
[166:42.87]Ten more.
[166:43.31]No, I don't want to cut these down.
[166:47.81]These are like baby trees.
[166:49.97]They need to mature a little bit first.
[166:59.33]Looks like tomorrow's gonna be corn time.
[167:16.78]Almost.
[167:18.66]Almost.
[167:28.08]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5.
[167:44.44]Out of my way, please.
[167:47.28]Did you just call me Jerry?
[167:48.26]Hey, Jerry.
[167:49.96]Jerry, notice me.
[167:50.86]Come on, Jerry.
[168:03.28]should be enough sap right one two three four five okay time to plant time to do our giant cranberry bog looks like we're all set 35 I have 35. well
[168:30.54]One, two, three, four, five.
[168:34.69]I need some more sap.
[168:41.83]Almost there.
[168:44.53]It's going to be so worth it, though, guys.
[168:45.89]It's going to be so worth it.
[168:48.96]Jerry doesn't see me.
[168:51.26]Oh, god damn, Jerry.
[168:52.64]Come on, notice me, Jerry.
[169:05.38]One, two, three, four, five.
[169:11.99]Hopefully this gives me a lot of money because this, this costed what?
[169:16.42]8,500 gold.
[169:18.60]Let's hope it was worth it.
[169:22.62]So these keep producing too.
[169:23.75]Damn.
[169:47.25]Water him up.
[169:54.25]What a nice hard day's work.
[170:02.62]So let's see.
[170:04.20]8,500.
[170:05.46]Remember that number.
[170:06.68]Because if I don't make more than like $15,000 from these, then it really probably wasn't worth it.
[170:19.38]Get out of here.
[170:20.34]You're encroaching.
[170:21.08]Alright.
[170:26.41]Water the corn.
[170:29.69]And then back to bed.
[170:35.80]I'm running out of energy.
[170:36.46]Can I eat something?
[170:38.18]Oh, this stupid asshole still needs this.
[170:40.02]Do I even care about that guy?
[170:41.18]Should I just
[170:54.96]Give me a fish.
[170:55.66]Give me like a shitty pond fish that I can just eat right now.
[171:08.04]Shit, can I eat the CD?
[171:08.92]Ah, damn it.
[171:11.58]Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[171:15.49]Sorry, Frank.
[171:17.99]But this is too important.
[171:22.00]I need to eat this.
[171:24.26]Where's my coffee?
[171:24.76]I don't have any coffee, right?
[171:26.52]Can I eat these fibers?
[171:35.06]Yeah, I fucked it.
[171:36.26]Whoa!
[171:36.52]I can pick up the corn!
[171:39.14]Oh my god!
[171:39.50]I didn't think it was ready!
[171:41.75]Okay, we're gonna eat the corn.
[171:46.65]No, we're not.
[171:47.23]No, we're not.
[171:47.69]No, we are not gonna do that.
[171:49.77]I wanna sell the corn.
[171:53.23]I don't care about that stupid asshole.
[172:06.62]I can't even tell what needs to be picked.
[172:23.70]It's all the top rows done.
[172:28.78]Come on.
[172:29.67]I need to sell these.
[172:30.37]Wait, this one's not.
[172:34.11]I gotta water that one.
[172:38.67]And that one.
[172:49.14]Did I get them all?
[172:53.12]Alright, guys.
[172:53.58]Are you ready to sell?
[172:56.26]Fuck!
[173:01.03]40 regular corns?
[173:01.91]Where are my rare ones?
[173:04.79]Are you serious?
[173:09.37]40... 40 corns picked up and only one of them.
[173:13.31]41.
[173:13.58]Come on.
[173:14.06]Yeah, 43 normal corns.
[173:35.30]Time to sell it.
[173:36.52]43 coins, guys.
[173:38.55]I cannot believe that 43 coins.
[173:44.35]What's going on?
[173:49.25]What the hell's going on?
[173:49.87]What was all those noises?
[173:53.75]That was a bunch of weird noises.
[173:56.17]Oh, back to bed.
[174:01.78]Alright, bring in the money.
[174:08.09]Bring in the cash.
[174:09.73]This is what we, this is what I want to see.
[174:11.21]Plus one watering can proficiency.
[174:16.04]Plus one hoe proficiency.
[174:17.54]Hardwood fence, cheese press, and a quality sprinkler.
[174:21.88]That, okay.
[174:23.71]How much did I get for the corn?
[174:34.39]That's not worth it at all.
[174:38.38]That's not very much money at all.
[174:44.26]$2,400 for 43 corns.
[174:47.71]And it took 14 days.
[174:48.89]14 days.
[174:50.79]That was so not worth it.
[174:58.01]How much did I buy these for?
[175:04.03]14 days That took so long It's taken like three or four full streams of this game at like three to five hours per stream to get that corn and I could have made more money killing bugs in the cave
[175:30.52]What a bunch of dog shit.
[175:32.58]Well, whatever.
[175:33.98]They're going to continue to produce.
[175:35.36]I'll get one more harvest.
[175:40.36]Not worth it at all.
[175:42.49]I wish somebody told me this before I did it.
[175:47.39]Everybody was like screaming to not do this.
[175:49.55]That's so funny.
[175:57.86]I forgot a corn.
[176:03.36]I forgot.
[176:03.82]It's hard to see which ones don't have corn on them.
[176:06.74]Actually, no, I didn't forget it.
[176:07.48]Those ones needed one more day.
[176:09.34]I remember.
[176:09.68]It's alright.
[176:23.69]Cranberries are gonna take over.
[176:25.21]It'll be fine.
[176:29.11]Everything's gonna be fine.
[176:35.21]Fire's been going for a very long time.
[176:46.36]Well, what else can I get?
[176:48.50]Should I get some, like, eggplants or something?
[176:50.00]Put it over there?
[176:50.50]Yeah, we're gonna go with some eggplant.
[177:00.61]Or something else, like pumpkin seeds or something.
[177:11.04]But this fire is freaking me out.
[177:12.44]Here you go, dog.
[177:12.98]I'm clearing out my dog's nest.
[177:25.76]Oh, corn regrows every four days after its first harvest.
[177:29.32]Okay.
[177:34.10]Bunch of amaranth?
[177:37.50]I don't even know what that is.
[177:46.07]Down to town.
[177:48.21]Down to town, back to bed.
[177:59.71]Even still though, something that takes that long to get a first harvest?
[178:06.11]Oh my god, fuck this guy's store.
[178:09.63]Every time I want to go buy something, it happens to be on a Wednesday.
[178:14.35]And he's closed on Wednesdays.
[178:15.91]You odd son of a bitch.
[178:34.90]Going to the spa.
[178:41.29]Where's my scythe?
[178:43.71]Get rid of this crap.
[178:50.61]Actually, hold on.
[178:52.45]Iron ore.
[178:53.73]Coal.
[179:03.00]Whoa, don't throw the fishing rod away.
[179:04.28]Let's make some bars.
[179:11.93]Yeah, he is technically still missing his pants.
[179:23.37]How many tiles does the quality sprinkler take?
[179:30.71]It's taking a long time.
[179:34.74]Can I upgrade my furnace?
[179:35.98]Because this is taking a long ass time.
[179:46.09]Jeez.
[179:53.58]Come on.
[180:00.40]Oh my god!
[180:01.22]Do I have to seriously make like four furnaces right now?
[180:14.00]Yeah, okay, this is taking a long, extremely long time.
[180:17.02]I'm just gonna have a house full of furnaces.
[180:25.57]I'm gonna burn my house down.
[180:35.24]Let's get it right next to the bed.
[180:43.57]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[180:48.57]Auti.
[180:49.70]Auti underscore.
[180:50.46]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[180:51.34]Appreciate it.
[180:51.80]I need five ores.
[180:57.18]It's going to be one, two, three, four.
[181:00.08]Not enough.
[181:04.17]You can place furnaces outside.
[181:05.25]Yeah, but people steal my shit all the time.
[181:06.81]I don't want them to steal them.
[181:14.67]That one looks like it's going to light my couch on.
[181:17.07]I'm like, no, that's a bed.
[181:23.66]No, because I don't put the furnace outside.
[181:25.76]Are you guys serious?
[181:26.52]I don't have to pay for heat now.
[181:29.26]My gas bill is going to go way down.
[181:34.26]You put four furnaces in your house and you have them running even for like 10 minutes.
[181:39.48]You can put the heat, you can put the thermostat down to like 50.
[181:50.03]Why am I still standing here?
[181:53.94]Can you turn on the fireplace?
[181:55.06]Can you?
[181:56.30]Oh, there we go.
[181:56.88]Even more heat.
[182:11.13]Boink, boink.
[182:11.71]Okay, let's go.
[182:12.63]Put that away.
[182:15.51]Da, da, da, da, da.
[182:21.41]Alright, we're doing the path.
[182:22.93]I'm going to redo our path.
[182:27.58]So let's do this.
[183:00.19]I ran out of path.
[183:03.58]I ran out of path.
[183:04.48]How do I make more path?
[183:08.60]Ah, there it is.
[183:16.09]It's gonna be nice, trust me, watch.
[183:24.39]Get this thing out of the way.
[183:25.99]Oh, you're ruining everything!
[183:29.09]This thing is really ruining everything.
[183:30.61]Isn't this nice?
[183:54.73]Isn't this nicer?
[184:25.37]Where's my pickaxe?
[184:34.97]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[184:36.27]Okay.
[184:51.02]Just keep all the burglars.
[185:02.21]Can I fucking fill this pond?
[185:19.98]There's just so much trash in the way and I can't do anything about it.
[185:30.29]I'm gonna go around the... Nobody's moving the meteor, so it doesn't matter.
[185:44.42]Mouse, get out of the way.
[185:59.86]Okay.
[186:09.45]Alright.
[186:11.13]Now we're safe.
[186:16.25]Look at that!
[186:17.83]Would you, look at that!
[186:21.68]My property is now secure.
[186:41.18]Need more gravel.
[186:51.08]There's a little walking path and people can come take a tour.
[186:53.54]Uh, this is a lost cause, but that's okay.
[186:59.90]Phew.
[187:03.12]Okay.
[187:04.22]Back to bed.
[187:15.66]Mr. Farmer.
[187:16.40]Look at this.
[187:18.62]See?
[187:18.84]That looks so much better.
[187:22.71]I feel more at home.
[187:25.39]Now, obviously, after the fall, we're going to clean this up.
[187:28.17]And we're going to expand down there.
[187:30.29]But these two little slots here?
[187:31.71]Look at these two little slots.
[187:35.09]These are perfect.
[187:37.35]Ah, nice.
[187:38.93]Okay.
[187:43.42]Who cares?
[187:46.96]What am I doing now?
[187:49.20]Oh, yeah.
[187:49.46]Let's look into sprinklers.
[187:53.46]Sprinkler.
[187:54.12]Quality sprinkler.
[187:56.29]I'm not going to be able to make those.
[187:59.53]Iron, gold, and refined quartz.
[188:01.37]So, thank God it's raining because there's no way I'm making those right now.
[188:16.52]change my mind I want one of these to go right in the middle
[188:46.71]Okay.
[188:51.51]Okay.
[188:56.63]Nice.
[188:56.89]We made a jacket.
[188:58.79]There's the zipper in the middle.
[189:00.49]This is like a woman's blouse.
[189:04.30]Congratulations.
[189:13.20]That looks so bad.
[189:15.98]You're looking at it at the wrong angle.
[189:19.31]Tilt your head a little bit.
[189:21.95]Tilt your head and squint your eyes and blur them a little.
[189:27.05]And then drink like four beers.
[189:28.33]It'll look fine.
[189:41.59]That's not a bad farm.
[189:42.69]You guys are being so mean.
[189:45.96]Alright, I need iron.
[189:47.48]So we're going to take a trip to the mine.
[189:48.81]And we're going to go smash some skulls in.
[190:01.53]Storage.
[190:02.77]Should I just sell these?
[190:04.35]Can I get money for these?
[190:06.81]I'm sure I can.
[190:07.57]Let's just see how much they're worth.
[190:08.79]It might be better to sell them.
[190:18.68]No, I'm gonna keep... I'm gonna eat the corn and down... Yeah, I'll eat the corn down there if I need it.
[190:21.86]Corn sucks.
[190:35.13]Do I have any other food?
[190:35.81]No.
[190:37.61]I'm gonna see how much is it worth, though.
[190:39.56]Hey, it's raining out, dawg.
[190:46.35]Wild seeds are junk anyways.
[190:47.72]I'll just sell them then.
[190:48.62]Who cares?
[190:49.14]I don't want to... 30.
[190:51.14]I'd rather put, like, eggplant over there.
[191:02.55]I'll probably get a good, pretty penny for these.
[191:06.87]Is it Wednesday?
[191:07.53]It better not be Wednesday.
[191:08.27]No, it's Thursday.
[191:08.77]Thank God.
[191:13.51]Nope.
[191:16.26]What are you going to give me for my mixed seeds?
[191:21.49]Not bad, considering I'm... I have to wait a... Yeah, I'm doing it.
[191:25.79]I really don't want to wait a whole year to be able to use those.
[191:29.41]And they might just be junk.
[191:32.51]So, we're not going to do that instead.
[191:36.53]Bok choy eggplant.
[191:40.49]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[191:45.95]Fleary.
[191:47.51]Fleary.
[191:48.01]Fleary.
[191:48.56]Fleary.
[191:49.06]I'm not sure how you pronounce it, but Fleary.
[191:50.98]Thanks for stopping.
[191:51.60]Welcome.
[191:52.50]Welcome aboard.
[191:53.18]Welcome aboard the train.
[191:55.74]Just taking off into Jerma Station.
[191:56.94]That was so... I'm sorry.
[191:57.86]That was awful.
[191:59.64]Ooh, grapes.
[192:01.00]Ten days?
[192:04.87]No, it's... Yeah, maybe a little... I kind of want to do the grapes.
[192:11.17]Grapes.
[192:16.79]Grapes in that other side where the corn is.
[192:21.23]That's too long.
[192:21.97]I want something that comes out a quicker turnaround than that.
[192:24.23]Yams?
[192:24.95]No.
[192:25.41]Bok choy.
[192:25.95]Bok choy is the fastest.
[192:38.23]Yeah, I'm going to do bok choy.
[192:42.88]Or, no, we're doing eggplant because it's, no, eggplant's probably so cheap and awful.
[192:50.31]Yams.
[192:53.05]Fine, we can do yams.
[192:57.07]Can make wine too?
[192:57.99]I don't know.
[193:00.53]I'm doing grapes.
[193:01.71]That was my first choice.
[193:03.63]That's what I'm doing.
[193:06.23]Grape starter.
[193:07.01]Ten days.
[193:08.79]I'm only going to get like two or three harvests from it though.
[193:11.29]Let's do it.
[193:21.09]I can't stop!
[193:21.59]I don't know what I'm doing!
[193:22.91]Okay, stop.
[193:43.65]Let's go to the mine.
[193:51.37]Mine time.
[193:59.14]Better make some wine out of that.
[194:03.75]Have fun watering those.
[194:05.11]I really just got so carried away.
[194:10.01]I just had a lot of money.
[194:18.95]Explain myself.
[194:19.91]I just, I wanted to get to a hundred and I don't know why.
[194:25.27]Can you actually make wine?
[194:26.31]Because I'm going to try to do it, whatever it is.
[194:36.47]Don't ever go to Vegas.
[194:39.95]No, I play my slot machine games.
[194:42.07]I don't need to go to Vegas.
[194:43.35]I get the same itch from the slot machines.
[194:47.24]Can I break this at some point?
[194:50.57]Eventually, I guess.
[194:51.41]40.
[194:54.47]Let's see if we can get some more iron.
[195:07.30]Hey, look at that.
[195:08.02]Right away.
[195:08.36]Let's watch out for the fuzzballs.
[195:19.88]Ooh, sap.
[195:24.98]Big rock.
[195:25.46]Might as well break it.
[195:29.98]It's not just good.
[195:31.44]It's the best.
[195:40.79]Can anybody steal things down here?
[195:42.03]I thought I could pick up that frozen geodude.
[195:47.41]Is that what that is?
[195:57.98]What the hell is this?
[196:00.04]Frozen tear?
[196:03.46]Okay.
[196:07.12]Anything else?
[196:07.78]No, we're going down.
[196:16.35]Fuzzballs!
[196:17.25]See ya.
[196:18.01]Hey, look at that.
[196:20.91]Don't even need to do anything.
[196:21.87]I can just go right down.
[196:22.67]But I do want to kill these guys.
[196:23.65]They might have something for me.
[196:27.35]I gotta be careful.
[196:30.95]Okay, getting kind of swarmed here.
[196:36.65]Good thing I brought the corn.
[196:37.49]What is it?
[196:49.72]Yeah, there's a box over there.
[196:51.06]There's a couple things in here actually.
[197:03.08]Quarantine.
[197:07.53]Very nice.
[197:13.02]Iron!
[197:16.44]Oh, that's two frozen Geodudes.
[197:20.24]Hell yeah.
[197:28.93]Nice, look at this.
[197:29.93]This little clump collection of iron.
[197:32.98]Awesome.
[197:43.40]Nothing over there.
[197:46.00]Iron to the right.
[197:46.79]We already got what we came for so that's good.
[197:49.43]That's good.
[198:02.98]Corn time.
[198:11.61]You could charge a shitload of money and lose it.
[198:13.19]Yeah, I'm not gonna die in the mine.
[198:15.25]If it even gets close, I'm turning around and running.
[198:21.16]I'm alright, though.
[198:29.66]I won't be sticking around.
[198:32.05]I came here for iron, I got iron, and upgraded my pickaxe.
[198:39.65]45.
[198:42.57]Ding.
[198:43.01]I don't want to push my luck, so let's just take it easy.
[198:58.24]Did that bring me the food?
[199:03.31]No.
[199:05.29]Out of food.
[199:16.69]Just keep it out, he won't be able to hit you.
[199:28.80]Getting close to that time when I'm gonna have to leave.
[199:44.80]Maybe I'll do that trick that you guys are saying.
[199:48.52]Just use a bunch of stone and go down to 50.
[199:49.86]Because I probably will.
[199:52.36]Whoa, whoa.
[199:53.02]Dwarf scroll.
[199:55.34]Dwarf scroll.
[199:57.81]A level 3 dwarf scroll?
[200:01.53]I can learn to spit fire out of my ass like a dwarf?
[200:09.72]Just go.
[200:10.08]I don't want to waste any time.
[200:23.36]Looking at the top left, what does that little skull with the H mean?
[200:26.42]No, not H. Is this just a monster level?
[200:29.56]I have to kill everything before I can leave?
[200:32.05]I'm gonna say yeah.
[200:46.19]Easy enough.
[200:47.77]Whoa, not easy enough.
[200:51.85]These little fuzzballs are the worst.
[200:54.77]They jump around, so I can't even tell, like, actually what plane they're on.
[200:57.33]Is it, like, to my right or above me or down or up?
[201:01.23]I don't know what, like, tile they're on when they're jumping like this.
[201:04.01]Crystal fruit.
[201:08.78]Might be able to... Might be able to fill up our bank account with that one.
[201:13.04]Can I eat it?
[201:14.80]Yeah, I can.
[201:19.52]Should I sell that or should I do something else with it?
[201:25.05]Almost 8 o'clock.
[201:29.37]What is the way down?
[201:32.45]Did I walk by it?
[201:37.67]What?
[201:40.59]Why is it saying that to me?
[201:43.33]I don't see a way down.
[201:46.51]It like blended in with this other ladder.
[201:48.69]I thought that was just the way up.
[201:49.91]Are you kidding me?
[201:52.70]That was dumb.
[202:19.12]Is that different?
[202:19.58]It looks different.
[202:20.75]No.
[202:26.69]Almost at 50.
[202:27.33]Remember when I said I needed torches?
[202:32.31]Funny how that turns out to be completely unnecessary.
[202:34.52]Like, really.
[202:38.72]I can't think of anything more unnecessary than the torches that I bought.
[202:42.84]Or crafted, whatever.
[202:51.79]Am I reading this right?
[202:52.73]Is Jerma gonna water 70 grapes by hand?
[202:57.73]Yeah.
[202:58.19]Hey, look, 50.
[203:00.06]We can leave.
[203:01.74]But let me just get all this free iron, because look at it.
[203:03.64]It's everywhere.
[203:13.62]I have a lot of iron.
[203:14.56]A ton.
[203:21.04]Lead rod?
[203:23.52]Ooh!
[203:25.47]18, 27.
[203:25.77]15, 26.
[203:26.57]This is better.
[203:28.67]Minus 4 speed?
[203:32.09]Let's see what that looks like.
[203:34.91]Minus 4 speed.
[203:36.13]I mean, I can kind of feel it.
[203:47.70]But it is a big sweeping motion.
[203:49.32]Let's see what it's like without it on.
[203:55.38]I don't know.
[203:55.68]That's a lot of minus speed.
[204:00.68]That's almost too much.
[204:01.64]I don't think I can handle that.
[204:04.64]What?
[204:07.26]What the hell?
[204:07.80]Alright, we can leave.
[204:19.73]Time to go.
[204:22.41]11.30 PM.
[204:23.21]Perfect timing.
[204:24.75]Oh, wait.
[204:24.91]There's a couple more blocks.
[204:29.94]Down to 50.
[204:32.30]Get the free treasure chest.
[204:36.16]Tundra boots.
[204:39.96]Cool.
[204:40.44]What do they do?
[204:43.58]Two defense.
[204:44.12]One immunity.
[204:44.54]They're better than these.
[204:45.22]Put them on.
[204:52.82]I just want to see.
[204:53.78]I just want to see.
[204:54.88]I just want to look.
[204:55.36]I knew I should have looked.
[204:58.30]Okay, go.
[205:01.52]Run, run, run, run, run.
[205:07.48]Back to bed.
[205:09.56]Back to bed with you.
[205:10.48]I hate when it gets dark.
[205:21.72]Purple boots to match my grapes.
[205:23.08]That's right.
[205:32.28]Can I get robbed?
[205:33.93]Can I go... I already screwed it up.
[205:36.85]I went the long way.
[205:40.79]Yeah, I went the long way, didn't I?
[205:43.11]Oh, crap.
[205:45.93]See, I got plenty of time.
[205:52.14]Yeah, I got plenty of time.
[205:53.98]I went through town.
[205:54.80]I should have just went all the way to the left.
[206:02.78]Back to bed with you.

[207:09.11]What a disaster.
[207:11.30]Hold on, let me sell some shit.
[207:16.12]I'm gonna get rid of the quartz.
[207:19.52]That's a big payday.
[207:25.85]Bat wings.
[207:31.46]I need a big payday, so yeah, we're getting rid of a lot of things here that I could potentially hold on to.
[207:43.94]Pinecone.
[207:45.04]Quartz.
[207:49.10]This, this, this.
[207:52.04]I'll donate that.

[208:04.29]Get rid of it.
[208:07.87]Keep the quartz.
[208:11.35]I want a big payday!
[208:17.20]I had- I got two super quartz, it's fine!
[208:20.20]I had like six shitty quartz, I still have two super quartz.

[208:23.58]Everything's gonna be fine.
[208:26.81]Take this five wood, too.
[208:27.79]Okay, 50 iron.
[208:40.86]I need one more iron.
[208:45.36]Crap, I feel like somebody's gonna want this at some point.
[208:47.72]I'm gonna hold on to it.
[208:55.22]Quantity over quality.
[208:58.14]I'm going to sell the bat.
[209:03.53]Donate this, donate that.
[209:06.13]Get rid of these two things.
[209:07.11]Okay, I've got to make a trip to the right side of town.
[209:12.29]But first, let's craft up some iron.
[209:16.72]I need one bar.
[209:19.76]I'll put the steel pickaxe in.
[209:29.49]A quality sprinkler.
[209:30.43]I feel like I'm going to need a million of those.
[209:37.53]Let's take a look.
[209:39.90]Well, I definitely want fertilizer.
[209:43.74]One refined quartz.
[209:45.10]What is the eight adjacent tiles every morning?
[209:50.17]I need a gold bar.
[209:51.05]I don't have any gold bars.
[209:52.23]I'm going to have plenty of iron.
[209:55.06]I can do quartz, whatever, but I don't have any gold bars yet.
[209:59.70]I haven't gotten that far.
[210:00.44]I could do this.
[210:06.23]But that kind of sucks.
[210:19.42]Crab pot?
[210:22.31]Ooh.
[210:25.27]I think my plans just changed.
[210:27.75]Yeah, they did.
[210:28.39]I want a crab pot.
[210:30.93]I want a crab pot.
[210:33.07]All plans are changed.
[210:34.70]I got a bunch of bait, too.
[210:38.80]I want to make crabs.
[210:43.08]Three iron bars.
[210:44.22]Easy.
[210:47.11]Done.
[210:48.57]Crab pot.
[210:53.83]I'm making like three crab pots.
[211:03.08]Everything just changed.
[211:05.74]Everything has changed.
[211:06.94]The game has changed, gentlemen.
[211:24.60]Alright, let's plant these grapes.
[211:27.72]After I get my second crab pot.
[211:36.37]You know, we'll do one crab pot.
[211:38.37]You know what?
[211:38.89]No, we're doing two crab pots.
[211:43.18]I'm gonna catch so much cool shit in this.
[211:44.78]Alright, well that's cooking.
[211:49.92]I need sap.
[211:52.77]So, I need to get Sappany to, uh, you know, huh.
[211:57.33]Huh.
[211:59.78]You know.
[212:06.94]Make some rum.
[212:12.97]My strategy has taken me through the fall.
[212:16.07]In the spring and summer.
[212:16.97]Wrong tool.
[212:17.21]Wrong tool.
[212:19.11]Wrong tool.
[212:22.50]I have a pretty unique strategy.
[212:23.86]It's not going to be negative profit.
[212:29.82]Do you see how many cranberries I have?
[212:31.90]I have so many cranberries.
[212:41.37]I can do grapes and crabs.
[212:47.13]Not a big deal.
[212:50.58]It's all 70 grapes.
[212:53.43]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its sexiness.
[212:57.31]Hey, hi-ho-he.
[212:58.83]Hi-ho-he.
[212:59.51]Hi-ho-he.
[213:02.05]Hi-ho-hey.
[213:03.77]Thank you for subscribing.
[213:04.85]Welcome.
[213:06.08]Hey, you guys want to see a freakout?
[213:07.86]Watch the chat when I do this shit.
[213:09.22]That's how the grapes are going.
[213:25.68]Second crab pot.
[213:33.72]No, I need to go back in there.
[213:39.98]Fertilizer.
[213:41.56]Where's my hoe?
[213:43.08]Here it is.
[213:43.50]Let's make a little more fertilizer.
[213:47.18]Time for the grapes.
[213:56.95]Alright, we have 70 grapes.
[213:58.46]Do I even have enough room for 70 grapes?
[214:00.68]Let's see.
[214:02.10]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
[214:21.43]18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26.
[214:22.53]Okay, no, I don't want to do this.
[214:25.55]I want a space in between.
[214:26.95]So 27, 28, 29, 30.
[214:51.27]35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50.
[214:51.77]We're donating the other ones to charity.
[214:54.23]Because I can go down one, two, three, down one, two, three.
[215:25.91]I don't even care about fertilization.
[215:31.65]I'll get, like, the first row.
[215:35.83]No, I want this.
[215:36.47]I don't... Like this.
[215:44.32]So then I can go like this.
[215:45.44]I need it to look neat.
[215:53.33]That's not neat.
[215:57.00]Okay, you know how there's like corn down here?
[215:59.22]Well, hold on a second.
[216:00.60]There's gonna be grapes over there too.
[216:02.20]Alright, grapes.
[216:06.43]Let's see how many of these I can put on here.
[216:19.14]What the hell's going on?
[216:21.48]Okay.
[216:30.70]You can't walk through these.
[216:31.72]Okay.
[216:32.40]That's okay.
[216:33.08]It's fine.
[216:33.40]It's fine.
[216:33.64]It's fine.
[216:34.28]It's fine.
[216:35.60]That's okay.
[216:36.36]I'm gonna be fine.
[216:36.86]Because I can walk around.
[216:45.40]Good thing I didn't do that.
[216:46.64]Because that would have been a nightmare.
[216:49.57]Can you plant... Fucking mouse, get out of the way.
[216:51.65]The mouse is always screwing me up.
[216:56.61]Okay.
[216:57.05]Well, if you're not gonna... I'm gonna have to do it with the mouse then.
[217:03.42]Train is passing by.
[217:04.20]Should I get hit by the train again?
[217:19.17]God, I'm... I... I don't have any room for these.
[217:21.99]I don't have any room for these!
[217:24.35]I still have, like, another 30 to plant!
[217:29.60]Shit!
[217:30.56]Um...
[217:34.96]This is all wrong.
[217:35.94]Actually, no, this is fine.
[217:36.82]This is okay.
[217:38.56]This is okay.
[217:41.05]Uh, this is fine.
[217:42.47]This is gonna be alright.
[217:43.57]Everything's gonna be fine.
[217:45.75]Everything's gonna be fine.
[217:47.93]Everything's gonna be fine.
[217:52.63]Everything's gonna be fine.
[217:58.05]We need to protect our vellons with grapes.
[218:00.99]It's important.
[218:12.95]Make a fence of grapes.
[218:14.88]Everything's gonna be alright.
[218:15.66]Everyone should calm down.
[218:17.84]Everything's gonna be okay.
[218:21.00]You guys, everyone's overreacting.
[218:23.56]Don't worry.
[218:24.08]See?
[218:24.26]There's still room.
[218:28.56]All we gotta do is get rid of this fence.
[218:32.85]Smash the fucking fence.
[218:33.77]Who cares?
[218:34.15]And over here, this is gonna be another little patch.
[218:45.62]2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[218:46.58]I wish these would plant so I don't have to use the mouse.
[219:16.04]Alright.
[219:20.46]What a fucking nightmare.
[219:26.24]This is a nightmare.
[219:29.03]Where's the scarecrow gonna go?
[219:34.23]Um...
[219:47.98]I need another scarecrow.
[219:49.40]He's going to go over here.
[219:51.18]Another scarecrow is going to go over there.
[219:52.44]I'm going to take that fence down.
[219:56.32]But first, let me just make sure I can get these watered.
[219:58.04]Where's my can?
[220:12.63]We're going to be fine.
[220:13.39]I just want to make sure I can water these.
[220:14.75]I want to make sure this doesn't take all day.
[220:19.84]Here we go.
[220:23.65]See, it's working fine.
[220:24.77]I just need to... I just need to... It's not the nicest looking, but it will yield us grapes.
[220:30.07]Get the fuck out of the way.
[220:41.59]Stupid fence get out of the way.
[220:42.85]This is unnecessary Go away fence.
[220:46.47]There's no reason for you to be here.
[220:48.11]I'm gonna fucking I need energy.
[220:50.17]Where's my crystal fruit?
[220:52.57]Where's my secret ancient fruit?
[220:54.11]I'm gonna eat it.
[220:57.84]I'm gonna eat it because there's gonna be crows Where's the ancient fruit?
[221:02.66]Eat it.
[221:03.06]I don't even care if it's worth anything.
[221:05.18]This is way more important
[221:12.03]Three, two, one.
[221:13.95]It's been eaten.
[221:17.07]I ate it.
[221:21.74]Where was I?
[221:22.16]I don't even remember.
[221:22.88]Right here?
[221:23.12]No, it was right here.
[221:47.42]It's getting late.
[221:48.10]It's alright.
[221:51.62]I'm almost done with my first pass of watering.
[221:54.64]I still have to water these.
[221:55.28]Shit in my pants!
[221:59.24]No!
[221:59.58]No!
[222:02.04]I haven't watered any.
[222:02.96]Let's go to bed.
[222:03.78]There better not be any crows here.
[222:22.49]Better not have, better not be any crows.
[222:24.13]No crows, no crows, no crows.
[222:27.47]Whew.
[222:28.29]Okay.
[222:29.31]We're good.
[222:32.41]We are fine.
[222:33.41]Everything is fine.
[222:45.12]One, two, three.
[222:46.34]So then down, up, down, up,
[222:53.26]Down.
[222:55.10]Up.
[222:55.70]This is not an alright strategy.
[222:57.66]This is not a terrible strategy.
[223:00.58]Seems to be working.
[223:01.26]Everything's working fine.
[223:05.30]Gonna grab the edge.
[223:08.58]Grab this side.
[223:10.57]One, two, three.
[223:11.31]Put the scarecrow back.
[223:17.79]Over here.
[223:18.35]Right here.
[223:23.20]So that's out to here.
[223:24.58]I need one like right here.
[223:27.35]Not even breakfast time and I only got that hole watered.
[223:35.51]This is fucking stupid.
[223:39.37]I need to do whatever it takes now for the next day.
[223:41.79]I'm not going to water these plants.
[223:44.37]I'm going to do whatever it takes to get those sprinklers as soon as possible.
[223:50.69]Because this is not going to work.
[223:56.19]Why didn't you guys stop me when I was going to buy all those grapes?
[224:01.47]All I heard was do it.
[224:02.75]Do it.
[224:03.17]That's all I heard.
[224:04.30]Why should I just do one yield and then back to bed every day?
[224:29.64]I thought it was going to be fun.
[224:31.98]It's fun.
[224:42.39]Look, everything's fine.
[224:44.91]It's just taking me all of my energy.
[224:47.31]No, we're fine.
[224:47.85]No, no, no.
[224:48.25]Easy.
[224:49.09]We can just go to the spa.
[224:52.48]We don't have to go back to bed.
[224:53.68]We can go to the spa.
[224:54.32]The spa is going to be fine.
[224:57.78]I can recalibrate.
[225:00.87]And make a killing on these crops.
[225:08.98]See, not a bad idea after all.
[225:11.92]Oh, fuck.
[225:14.22]Almost hit the corn.
[225:26.81]Done.
[225:29.98]Done with the watering.
[225:31.26]Look at that.
[225:31.92]You know, if you want a job done, do it yourself.
[225:33.45]That's what I say.
[225:39.81]I definitely need another scarecrow.
[225:42.01]20 fiber.
[225:45.76]Did I, like, trash the... I need to go get my scythe.
[225:51.88]I'm not leaving this place without another scarecrow.
[225:55.47]Because that's going to be awful.
[225:57.57]It's going to be completely and totally awful.
[225:59.31]And then I can put my crab pot down, which is the better of the decisions I've had.
[226:03.07]I'm going to move him closer to... Actually... No, this is not even necessary.
[226:13.94]Because this is eight.
[226:15.48]These are fine.
[226:17.30]These are overkill.
[226:19.19]Right?
[226:19.31]Because if it's eight tiles in a radius, that's one, two, three, four, five.
[226:22.19]Yeah, this is fine.
[226:24.65]So I'll put one over here.
[226:28.81]Don't throw it in the trash, for God's sake.
[226:34.35]Yeah, he'll go right here.
[226:40.38]I can move out of the way.
[226:41.26]Who cares?
[226:44.04]One, two, three, four, five.
[226:46.82]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[226:48.81]This one down here.
[226:49.89]I'll put one right here.
[226:53.37]To cover that.
[226:56.07]Think that's gonna be fine.
[226:57.25]And this is an eyesore.
[226:58.13]I don't care.
[227:02.01]Who plants the crops on a zigzag?
[227:03.85]Because the corn!
[227:06.05]And I was making a corn track.
[227:10.42]Why not on the gravel path?
[227:11.44]Because if I need to walk over here... I guess I could do that, but... I guess that works.
[227:27.72]I'll move him too.
[227:30.76]I'm just scared that it's going to be in the way.
[227:32.00]It kind of is.
[227:45.30]Okay.
[227:47.84]There we go.
[227:49.73]Now we go to the spa.
[228:00.84]Get out of the way.
[228:01.50]Get out of my way.
[228:07.69]The good thing about those grapes is they're going to be ready soon.
[228:15.89]No, it's off-center.
[228:19.84]Wait, I need to go to the spa.
[228:22.38]I'm going there.
[228:31.58]Go to the spa.
[228:32.79]Hey, he's back.
[228:46.18]Hey, you want a plum?
[228:50.28]You're welcome.
[228:53.06]Shit, he still doesn't like me.
[228:55.34]I don't need new friends.
[228:56.16]Well, I'm trying as hard as I can.
[229:05.01]Those grapes aren't fertilized.
[229:06.03]I'm putting grandma to shame.
[229:08.34]Or grandpa.
[229:13.72]The grapes you planted have to be one space apart.
[229:16.82]Do they?
[229:17.10]I mean, I can grab them on either side.
[229:22.12]Let's just relax in the spa.
[229:29.71]Spend some time in the spa.
[229:36.58]then we can go to the Adventurers Guild and sell this crap and then we can plant our crab pots and at the same time we can potentially upgrade our iron bars into a steel pickaxe.
[229:51.59]You understand, guys?
[229:54.61]That's what we're doing.
[229:56.17]That's exactly where we're going to go.
[229:57.57]If you don't like it, then you can just take a look at the total money I've earned. $35,000.
[230:06.97]a lot of money that's a lot of money I've done good I've done a good job right mummy mummy say I did a good job mummy five thousand I should get that in a day or two
[230:37.74]Oh, what are you doing?
[230:38.82]He's just standing there.
[230:48.95]He's standing like an asshole.
[230:55.75]Let's go forage.
[230:59.15]Okay, I have... Where should I put the crab pots?
[231:04.51]The stream outside the house?
[231:08.21]Okay, I have this to donate.
[231:09.53]I have this to donate.
[231:12.68]And I have, don't I have frozen?
[231:15.42]I gotta go get them.
[231:18.10]I have those frozen tier things, don't I?
[231:28.53]It's already four o'clock.
[231:29.43]I don't think it even matters anymore.
[231:31.89]You going to class?
[231:32.43]Well, have a good class.
[231:33.61]Take it easy.
[231:37.23]Put the crab pot in the ocean.
[231:38.53]That's such a far walk.
[231:42.97]Hold on, let me look in here first.
[231:44.99]I wanted to do this too.
[231:50.98]You know why I get so distracted in this game?
[231:52.40]Because there's so many things to do and so many things to look at.
[231:58.18]Blackberry.
[231:59.66]Salmonberry.
[232:02.38]Wow.
[232:03.62]Nice work, bats.
[232:07.63]You pooped out stuff for me to take from you.
[232:21.86]Okie dokie.
[232:32.03]Four tears.
[232:34.53]Place the berry...
[232:37.69]Place.
[232:39.31]Get rid of this.
[232:40.37]Get rid of this.
[232:45.18]Donate.
[232:46.22]Anything else to donate?
[232:48.14]I need this for the crab pot.
[232:54.08]No.
[232:55.86]So we have four things to break open tomorrow.
[232:58.40]Okay, let's go to the ocean.
[233:07.24]Drugs better than fruit?
[233:08.14]I don't know.
[233:09.54]It depends on the fruit.
[233:19.05]Don't mind me.
[233:19.43]I'm just carrying a trash can around town.
[233:26.37]Where are you children off to?
[233:30.15]So I put one in the ocean.
[233:31.17]Should I put them both?
[233:32.89]I feel like I kind of want them both in the same spot.
[233:35.51]Easier to pick them up.
[233:37.60]How close am I to the ocean?
[233:40.14]I could do one here.
[233:42.62]And then one in the ocean.
[233:43.78]Is somebody going to take these?
[233:44.66]Is somebody going to steal these?
[233:49.77]We'll do one here and then one in the ocean.
[233:50.95]Because the ocean really is right here.
[233:53.75]So we'll do one over here.
[233:59.87]Right here.
[234:01.85]Boink.
[234:05.91]That's been baited.
[234:08.19]So this ninth is one bait.
[234:09.57]It only takes one bait, huh?
[234:10.61]Okay.
[234:11.89]Nobody touch my trash can.
[234:15.65]We'll do one in the ocean.
[234:20.41]I saw it first.
[234:21.39]I saw it first.
[234:21.81]Don't touch it.
[234:22.19]I saw this first.
[234:22.77]This too.
[234:26.53]This too.
[234:26.85]I saw this first.
[234:27.43]It's mine.
[234:33.17]Inventory full.
[234:33.81]Shit.
[234:40.37]I'm in the fucking trash.
[234:44.53]Close to the edge?
[234:45.85]Should I go off the dock?
[234:49.32]We're gonna go down here.
[234:50.74]All the way down here, straight ahead.
[234:56.06]Faded.
[234:57.99]Alright.
[234:59.51]Done deal.
[235:00.23]Back to bed.
[235:13.80]Come back in the morning and we'll see if anything is in there.
[235:16.55]Out of the way, kids.
[235:25.47]He's going to forget.
[235:26.23]I probably would.
[235:27.61]I have all these erratic ideas and none of them get done.
[235:39.80]Good thing I went to the spa.
[235:40.80]You're right.
[235:42.32]All that energy I needed.
[235:51.73]See, this is why I went to the spa, so I could do this.
[235:53.29]It's going to take a lot of energy to clean this out.
[236:04.01]Get rid of all this grass.
[236:10.20]Look at this encroachment.
[236:12.88]Get out of here.
[236:13.72]Where's my weed killer?
[236:17.66]I don't even want to go that close.
[236:23.15]Look at all this.
[236:23.81]Where is this even coming from?
[236:27.35]Get away from my crops.
[236:28.63]Look at what?
[236:29.77]Whose log is this?
[236:31.07]Why did you put it here?
[236:31.87]Look, get all this out of here.
[236:40.26]Did I plant these?
[236:41.16]Get away from my grapes.
[236:54.31]Damn it!
[236:55.07]No, it's okay.
[236:55.59]I didn't hit it.
[237:05.59]I wanna... There we go.
[237:09.03]Any more encroachment?
[237:09.95]No.
[237:30.29]Back to bed.
[237:43.90]145 gold.
[237:44.64]Good job.
[237:45.34]Alright, so this person, ZombieMan4, just says, wow, that farm looks real snazzy, Jerma.
[237:58.15]Thank you very much.
[237:59.15]Because a bunch of people were talking about how awful it looked.
[238:02.09]So, you might have just joined the stream.
[238:04.19]You just came in.
[238:06.40]Thank you.
[238:07.30]It looks pretty nice.
[238:09.68]I'm gonna have to agree with you.
[238:11.76]Thank you.
[238:16.78]That was his first impression.
[238:19.70]There was no... Nobody told him what to say.
[238:21.42]Nobody told him to say that.
[238:38.01]I gotta hit these Hard to tell if I'm which ones I haven't watered I'm gonna have to keep like a keen eye on the ground He saw it in the dark It's very funny
[239:08.23]Now that's TBS.
[239:10.81]Very funny.
[239:19.76]A real nice barber you got.
[239:25.40]Can't really see.
[239:27.48]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[239:32.16]Dermotick.
[239:34.47]Welcome to planet Earth.
[239:37.19]Thank you for stopping, dude.
[239:39.41]Or dudette.
[239:39.91]A lot of those plants.
[239:54.06]Get them nice and ready to go.
[239:55.52]I thought that was a person.
[240:02.94]I didn't think that was my dog.
[240:03.86]I thought that was an actual human being.
[240:10.33]Let's fill it up again.
[240:18.36]See, with these grapes, it's so hard to tell.
[240:19.98]I just don't know which ones haven't been watered.
[240:22.34]If I miss one, then I miss one.
[240:24.59]But I don't think I did.
[240:25.43]Ruff ruff.
[240:33.51]Get out of here, dog.
[240:40.25]Almost done.
[240:51.10]Is this corn ready to be picked up?
[240:53.28]It is.
[240:53.50]Hey, we can make like 2,500 bucks.
[241:05.89]Why are those the only ones that are ready?
[241:11.20]Odd.
[241:13.64]Something suspicious there.
[241:23.63]What does that even mean when it says a train is passing?
[241:26.03]Am I supposed to care about that?
[241:28.51]The last time I cared about that, I got ran over and died.
[241:31.87]What does that do?
[241:34.62]Does the train stop and does somebody come up?
[241:36.80]What is that purple tree doing in the middle of this?
[241:44.81]Like, should I care about that at all?
[241:53.96]Alright.
[241:54.82]Dog, what are you doing?

[253:59.04]I'm pretty sure there's going to be some grapes there.
[254:01.04]And then we can stop the stream.
[254:09.78]I'm curious as to what I get for these.
[254:14.28]Curious.
[254:14.88]Where am I going?
[254:15.36]I'm going to go up.

[254:33.21]I'm fine.
[254:34.45]Alright.
[254:35.09]Somebody said I missed a corn up here.
[254:36.33]There it is.

[255:15.42]We just don't make the same mistake next year.
[255:17.87]Right?
[255:18.07]We just don't buy corn again.
[255:20.97]We buy schnozberries or whatever the hell we're going to get.
[255:26.52]These are not ready yet.
[255:28.28]Look at... Thank God it rained.
[255:34.20]Oh, Linus.

[255:36.02]Sure thing, buddy.
[255:38.71]I will pick... I will... It's Blackberry.
[255:42.45]Linus can't find his basket.
[255:43.53]He's asking you to help him find it.
[255:46.35]In the bushes.
[255:46.93]Blackberry season or something?
[255:47.99]Okay, Linus.
[255:48.81]I got you.
[255:58.37]Now, do I need to harvest these with a scythe or something, or can I just pick them off the vine?
[256:05.58]We got corn, corn, corn.
[256:13.39]Corn everywhere.
[256:28.93]I'm getting so screwed.
[256:34.47]Still 32 regular ass corn.
[256:36.69]Yeah, get out of my sight.
[256:41.03]I don't even want to see you anymore.
[256:44.20]These should be ready soon, too.
[256:50.52]These might even be ready now.
[256:55.08]How's that fire not out?
[257:02.20]Oh, somebody just, I just read where, I looked at the chat and it was just like, I saw the exact thing that somebody said where the basket is.
[257:08.73]Ugh, really?
[257:12.13]Where, is it really up here?
[257:19.59]Oh, well.
[257:21.19]Sometimes you get spoiled.
[257:30.27]Uh, somebody said it was next to the bus.
[257:32.89]Is that for real?
[257:33.57]I don't see it.
[257:52.56]There's this dude's basket.
[258:01.56]I didn't even know you could go this way.
[258:07.56]Well, when somebody says it's next to the bus... That was not next to the bus.
[258:16.08]Is that it right here?
[258:19.71]What?
[258:19.95]I just... I was trying to click on it.
[258:21.01]Okay, apparently you can go that way, I guess.
[258:30.57]Whatever.
[258:33.90]Ooh, hold on a second.
[258:34.94]What is this worth?
[258:37.30]What is this worth?
[258:38.78]This might be worth some money.
[258:41.74]Linus might be worth a little bit of cash.
[258:52.95]Is Linus outside in the rain or what?
[258:56.93]Does he go somewhere else?
[259:08.41]I hate berries.
[259:13.23]Hey, berries!
[259:14.23]Alright, Linus.
[259:22.15]I really, truly expect... Oh, these are... Hey, look at that.
[259:28.88]I truly expect you to give me at least two or three stars for this one.
[259:33.08]I went out of my way.
[259:33.98]See, he's not even here.
[259:36.26]Is he in his house?
[259:40.07]He uses it as a chamber pot.
[259:41.87]This is his toilet.
[259:43.53]He just calls it a blackberry bush thing.
[259:45.73]Hey, look, I found something.
[259:48.95]It means a lot to me.

[271:25.17]Yak Man, you got it.
[271:26.83]That's the bear from the Muppet movies.
[271:30.01]Specifically Muppets from space.
[271:33.26]You got it.
[271:47.02]So sick of the corn.
[271:53.50]It's the bear in the suit from Muppets in Space.
[271:55.64]I forget what his name is.
[272:06.62]Jerry Seinfeld, what?
[272:21.64]And done.
[272:25.25]You guys know what time it is.
[272:26.93]It's... Is there honey in here yet?
[272:34.76]No, not yet.
[272:36.44]There you go, dog.
[272:42.52]Back to bed.
[272:57.12]Are these ready?
[272:58.52]Are these already... Have these been ready and I'm just not harvesting them?
[273:04.68]I'm going for, I'm slashing them.
[273:06.08]I'm going to, I'm going to slash them.
[273:11.08]I'm going to just take an axe to one of these and see what happens.
[273:12.98]Because it, wasn't it, wasn't it, what was it?
[273:15.17]Four days or was it ten days?
[273:17.11]I don't even remember.
[273:17.99]God, how many calories are in these?
[273:25.93]How many calories?
[273:26.59]Oh, they're all bartered.
[273:31.82]Oh, honey.
[273:32.10]Honey.
[273:33.88]Honey.
[273:36.74]Oh, cool.
[273:39.07]I'm in the trash.
[273:42.31]Nice.
[273:47.30]That's awesome.
[273:49.12]I'm so happy.
[273:51.38]Was it 10?
[273:52.00]Okay.
[273:54.69]Back to bed.
[273:56.47]No, kidding.
[273:58.47]Need more coal.
[274:00.63]Well, I can sell 60 cranberries.
[274:02.63]I'm going to keep these ones because I'm going to show off my cranberry bog to the newspaper.
[274:06.53]Whatever the hell that guy was talking about.
[274:11.62]We're going to get rid of these 60 and 11.
[274:14.32]I'm going to have nine perfect cranberries.
[274:18.98]And a couple pieces of honey.
[274:20.68]Don't think I forgot about that.
[274:30.41]Yep, Geodudes, crab check, back to bed.
[274:35.27]Then, stream ends.
[274:38.82]So.
[274:40.38]How much are these worth?
[274:41.12]Fucking Wednesdays.
[274:46.56]Of course it's Wednesday.
[274:48.28]Why wouldn't it be a Wednesday?
[274:51.24]Do I want to go into the store?
[274:53.62]Well, it's a Wednesday.
[274:55.49]Every time.
[275:06.44]I got a snail!
[275:09.34]Can I make it a pet snail?
[275:15.81]This crab pot sucks.
[275:18.47]It's giving me snails, trash, and tiny jokes.
[275:23.13]Tiny jokes?
[275:30.80]What?
[275:36.47]I hate jokes.
[275:38.07]It is.
[275:38.43]It really is picking up little jokes.
[275:48.57]What's this worth?
[275:50.19]Nothing.
[275:55.00]Ooh, something's wrong with the bridge.
[275:57.86]Yeah, let's do it.
[275:58.62]Alright, that was fun.
[276:12.81]I know I'm going to bait it.
[276:15.77]And I want to see what I did over there.
[276:36.86]What the hell is even over there?
[276:37.78]Did I just waste like 300 wood?
[276:41.68]What is this?
[276:43.94]What the hell is over here?
[276:45.52]There's a person over here.
[276:46.24]There's a dude over here just sleeping.
[276:51.48]Okay.
[276:53.95]Let me just pick up all this stuff.
[276:56.29]And pick up all the carols.
[277:02.67]What is this guy's deal?
[277:05.15]Who is this?
[277:06.93]Old Mariner.
[277:09.35]Got this old amulet to sell, but something tells me you're not ready for it, lad.
[277:16.94]You don't know how much money I have in my bank account.
[277:22.63]I got $5,000 in my bank account, buddy.
[277:26.07]No amulet's worth that.
[277:27.01]Something's telling me this is a pretty good place to... I'm gonna fish down here.
[277:32.55]I feel like this is a good place to fish.
[277:54.80]It's a pretty interesting dog.
[277:55.81]I'm going to think I'm going to move the crab pot over here.
[277:58.91]We'll see what I get.
[278:08.21]Sardine.
[278:08.77]Sardine.
[278:25.10]Ah!
[278:26.50]Whoops.
[278:28.86]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[278:34.42]Where are your mods?
[278:35.10]I don't know.
[278:44.44]There should be a couple here.
[278:45.34]Nightbot's here.
[278:47.20]Even though he's kind of drunk, but, you know, sometimes he just is.
[278:55.82]That's a gold sardine.
[278:56.68]I'm putting that on display.
[278:57.52]Alright, time to go.
[279:13.61]Geodudes.
[279:23.25]Geodudes.
[279:24.81]And then we are out of here.
[279:27.15]Hopefully we get something good.
[279:32.53]Who am I voting for in the election?
[279:33.75]I'm writing in Benjamin Franklin.
[279:40.86]Or, or more importantly, Guy Smiley from Sesame Street.
[279:47.98]I haven't decided yet.
[279:53.14]Do I have anything to donate?
[279:53.78]I thought I did.
[279:57.22]Probably not.
[280:07.01]Hey, look at you.
[280:08.63]I will take one, please.
[280:11.03]Oh, shit.
[280:13.86]I'd like to sell some things.
[280:18.34]Fuck you!
[280:22.76]Just eat the, eat the... I'm just gonna let the snail go free.
[280:30.46]Alright, snail, go free.
[280:31.63]I just picked him up immediately.
[280:35.77]Snail, go free.
[280:37.39]In this guy's house.
[280:38.87]Breed.
[280:39.77]Get in the walls and breed.
[280:41.45]So he'll never get rid of your family.
[280:42.99]Okay, uh... Alright, thanks for the dog poo.
[280:55.03]For the love of God, just eat one of the fishes or something.
[280:57.25]I'm just throwing trash all over this guy's house.
[281:12.74]Oh, ice cube!
[281:22.92]Let's go.
[281:28.39]Okay, I can just throw those away.
[281:35.28]What else you got?
[281:39.66]Oh!
[281:41.42]Fairy stone!
[281:42.46]I'm just gonna sell that.
[281:45.45]Who knows what the fuck it is.
[281:47.15]These are all sellable things.
[281:51.19]Okay, out of all the animals I just let loose in this house, which one do I want?
[282:06.95]Throw the periwinkle on the ground.
[282:08.77]You know what?
[282:12.33]Some of this shit has to be worthless, right?
[282:13.61]I want the snail, though.
[282:16.33]I kind of want the snail.
[282:30.64]I want the snail.
[282:32.98]I'm eating this fish.
[282:35.49]It's a stupid little sardine.
[282:36.67]It's okay.
[282:38.69]Give me my snail back.
[282:42.43]Okay, let's go.
[282:43.53]Time to go home.
[282:50.13]Five coal.
[282:50.95]I need that coal.
[282:52.37]It's hard to get.
[282:52.91]Okay, I can donate some things.
[283:02.08]Blue ice cube.
[283:06.31]And... The purple cauliflower.
[283:11.95]Okie dokie.
[283:18.56]You're welcome.
[283:19.78]Bye.
[283:30.78]And that's... The way we roll.
[283:43.81]I'm probably gonna get corn tomorrow.
[284:09.73]Got ya!
[284:12.82]No, I wanted that snail!
[284:15.30]He's gonna be my best friend!
[284:16.86]Oh, I'm angry!
[284:18.88]Okay, uh, I was finishing something here.
[284:26.10]Look at all these berries.
[284:30.16]So many of them.
[284:32.25]This is just cash.
[284:33.43]Don't throw cash in the trash.
[284:36.85]I'm just gonna go berry harvesting right now.
[284:41.91]They're all getting sold.
[284:43.23]I'm going to be a trillionaire after this.
[284:46.31]God, I'm going to be a trillionaire.
[284:53.58]I haven't spoken to the wizard in a long time.
[284:57.24]I wonder what the hell he's up to.
[285:00.42]Kind of creeps me out, though.
[285:01.78]I don't want to... I don't want to go near him.
[285:06.76]I'd rather just make absolute bank selling berries.
[285:16.86]Damn.
[285:18.90]This is what we like to call a harvest.
[285:23.70]I might make more money selling these berries than any of the crops I've sold so far.
[285:29.18]What is this?
[285:32.54]Is that like a bridge you can build eventually?
[285:34.62]What is that?
[285:40.48]Hats.
[285:43.30]I've not even gone in this place once.
[285:45.44]Let's see what it is.
[285:54.37]What?
[286:02.59]Why did I do that?
[286:10.60]I look like a fucking dickhead now.
[286:17.80]At least I match.
[286:22.72]Yeah, I match.
[286:29.35]Alright, well, that's cool.
[286:33.59]You're welcome for the thousand gold I just gave you.
[286:38.33]Look like a fireman.
[286:44.26]That's worth it, I guess.
[286:47.66]We got more berries to get.
[286:48.56]I almost have 50 blackberries.
[286:56.26]I'm not going to sleep till I have 150.
[286:59.20]You heard it here.
[287:02.16]I'm getting 100 blackberries before I attempt to go to bed.
[287:11.37]Especially the ones into the sewer.
[287:12.49]Those are the ripest ones.
[287:20.10]52.
[287:20.20]More than halfway there.
[287:30.33]I hope this is worth it.
[287:36.52]Any more bushes over here?
[287:37.58]I don't think so.
[287:40.10]There are the bushes.
[287:51.05]Thank you.
[287:51.51]I will take all your berries. 100.
[288:04.07]Don't forget about Otto.
[288:05.01]I won't.
[288:06.28]As long as he gets the medicine between, like, any time in the evening at night.
[288:12.80]What is in my way?
[288:17.84]Ooh, mixed seeds.
[288:20.19]Wonderful.
[288:26.23]Mix them up in a stew.
[288:27.15]I think I already went over here.
[288:31.37]Yeah, I did.
[288:32.19]It's the wizard hut.
[288:35.43]64, 566.
[288:35.47]I think I'm going to keep the two golden ones.
[288:46.02]Maybe I'll put those on display.
[288:48.56]So people can say, wow, look at all the gold berries he has.
[288:53.14]He's such a good farmer.
[288:55.35]Be like, I know.
[288:57.49]Could have told you that.
[289:06.22]I got plenty of energy too.
[289:16.69]There's no bushes over here.
[289:17.79]Outta my way.
[289:21.26]OUTTA MY WAY!
[289:34.05]There we go.
[289:37.83]Getting closer.
[289:42.97]Shit.
[289:46.99]No, I gotta get a hundred.
[289:48.36]I have to have a hundred in my bank account.
[289:53.68]In my berry bank account.
[289:58.54]Where are the berries?
[289:59.24]Who's taking them?
[289:59.82]All these townspeople taking my berry bushes.
[290:11.66]I would have had it if the townspeople weren't so greedy taking all the berries.
[290:15.36]You know what I mean?
[290:17.70]It's like, leave some for the rest of us.
[290:31.41]We're gonna have to go back.
[290:32.37]I'm at 75 almost.
[290:33.93]It's getting late.
[290:39.55]I didn't want to have to go back, but I'm gonna have to.
[290:46.90]Jackpot.
[290:47.62]Give me the jackpot.
[290:48.40]Right here.
[290:53.97]80.
[290:56.43]Sorry, Linus.
[290:58.33]These are mine now.
[290:59.11]85.
[291:03.25]Up here?
[291:03.61]Is there a bunch up here?
[291:07.42]No!
[291:07.56]No!
[291:15.72]No, I gotta go back.
[291:18.70]87.
[291:20.50]Not 100.
[291:20.76]Yeah, I mean, let's be real here.
[291:26.49]If only the town wasn't so greedy.
[291:28.07]I'm gonna get it.
[291:37.08]Come on.
[291:37.50]93.
[291:38.90]Oh, get me in there.
[291:45.85]I can't.
[291:46.47]I can't do it.
[291:50.67]I can't do it.
[291:51.27]I came so close.
[291:52.53]95.
[291:52.69]I still got an A on the test.
[291:55.69]It's okay.
[291:58.50]Get this shit out of my way, please.
[292:09.87]There's so many trees in the way!
[292:18.35]I'm not gonna pass out here, am I?
[292:19.51]Because I'm locked in over here?
[292:20.65]No, thank God.
[292:25.54]Alright, uh... No, shit.
[292:29.86]I'm gonna fall asleep.
[292:33.56]Bedtime.
[292:34.68]Let's see what I get for those cranberries.
[292:38.08]Oh!
[292:41.20]Oh!
[292:44.10]That's... 11,000.
[292:50.42]11,000.
[292:50.62]That's the first time I've ever been over 10k in my bank account.
[292:58.36]And they're still producing.
[293:01.40]So, cranberries.
[293:03.88]You just want cranberries.
[293:05.46]You only want cranberries because they keep producing afterwards.
[293:09.16]Unbelievable.
[293:09.66]Like, why would you ever plant anything else?
[293:10.96]Ever.
[293:11.94]Ever.
[293:15.83]That's crazy.
[293:20.94]Okay, um, so that's that.
[293:23.38]Let me do some rearranging.
[293:31.26]Keeping the gold star stuff, because I need to put things on display.
[293:34.10]Let's see what we have in here.
[293:37.27]A lot of this is trash.
[293:39.93]Although, honey, how much is... Can I get money for honey?
[293:45.83]Well, let's... What else can I dump?
[293:52.52]I kind of don't want to dump anything.
[293:53.96]Except for the trash that's in my inventory.
[293:55.45]We're going to do that.
[293:55.99]I'm going to sell one honey.
[293:56.95]I'm just curious how much it's worth.
[294:00.07]Yeah, I spent 8,000 on these cranberries.
[294:03.89]And they've already returned.
[294:06.11]And they're still going.
[294:07.94]So, yeah, they're totally worth it.
[294:09.20]So we're going to do one honey.
[294:13.16]Just because I'm curious.
[294:13.78]I want to see what they're actually worth.
[294:15.90]Sell all this other dumb stuff.
[294:20.63]These mixed seeds.
[294:21.31]Who cares?
[294:21.67]I don't want any seeds.
[294:24.83]Alright.
[294:27.02]Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude.
[294:30.20]That's going to conclude this stream.
[294:33.42]Thanks for coming out.
[294:34.06]Thanks for watching.
[294:34.64]Thanks to all the new subs.
[294:35.44]Thanks to all the old subs.
[294:36.28]Thanks to all the new viewers, old viewers.
[294:38.95]Appreciate it.
[294:40.21]I will be back tomorrow night.
[294:42.87]I'm going to have a video up tomorrow.
[294:45.53]So there's that.
[294:47.67]Sometime after the video goes up.
[294:50.19]Hopefully it's up tomorrow because it should be done by then.
[294:55.04]And yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[294:56.96]Maybe we'll play this again.
[294:58.16]We'll play some Overwatch or something.
[294:59.23]We'll see.
[295:00.97]But yeah, much love, guys.
[295:01.83]Thanks for coming out.
[295:03.41]Have a good one.
[295:04.07]Have a good night.
[295:06.60]Goodbye.
