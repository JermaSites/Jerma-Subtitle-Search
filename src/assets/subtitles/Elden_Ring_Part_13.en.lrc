[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.33]Okay.
[00:07.93]We get Elden Ring opened.
[00:14.84]I am very excited about this.
[00:16.34]I do have to change a few things.
[00:19.36]The reason why I'm so excited about Elden Ring is we are, I believe, at one of the probably final points in the game.
[00:35.21]I am halfway, I believe, down the Haligtree.
[00:39.72]It looks like there was a lot more to go.
[00:40.92]I do have to change this title, though, because this doesn't work.
[00:47.76]Uh, how about... What's a good... I've done Elden Ring so many times, I don't even know what a good Elden Ring title is anymore.
[00:58.70]What do I title this?
[01:02.15]Elden Ring.
[01:06.05]Elden.
[01:06.63]Alright, spoiler alert.
[01:11.41]End game area.
[01:12.45]Spoiler alert.
[01:21.46]Hmm.
[01:23.98]Alert.
[01:27.18]Something easy, whatever.
[01:28.96]Elden Ring.
[01:31.33]Elden.
[01:32.34]Elden time.
[01:33.48]Onion ring.
[01:37.22]That's awful.
[01:41.64]Elden Ring.
[01:47.32]Getting to the end, question mark?
[01:53.07]We'll see.
[01:54.99]Stay tuned to find out.
[02:04.39]It's a bad title.
[02:05.18]Whatever, it doesn't matter.
[02:05.90]What is playing in my headphones?
[02:11.30]Oh, this music, right.
[02:12.44]I was like, where's that coming from?
[02:20.71]Okay.
[02:22.56]Very nice.
[02:33.42]Is the game going to get seen here?
[02:38.92]That's a tuber title if I've ever seen one.
[02:40.82]Yeah, it is.
[02:43.24]I agree.
[02:44.67]I'm not going to disagree with you.
[02:48.45]Sometimes tuber titles work.
[02:53.35]The face game is not going off.
[02:54.47]It's on.
[02:57.13]Face game is going to go.
[02:57.85]Okay.
[03:04.85]loading it what was the lack of the last thing that somebody gave me a list of things I could do by the way this is very much spoiler territory this is actually like the end of the game or like the final arc just please be aware of that be aware looking for game to capture it's right here dude
[03:37.06]this needs to shrink okay so we last thing that happened let me take a look at the map yeah so I yeah spoilers for anybody that like seriously does it's like what's happening this is the end game spoiler
[04:00.23]Uh, three, two, one.
[04:03.16]I burnt the Erdtree.
[04:04.84]The Erdtree is burning.
[04:06.04]The Round Table Hold is now burning.
[04:08.36]The Two Fingers are still stuck, uh, like, with their game crashed.
[04:17.06]I don't know why they're not back.
[04:19.76]You'd think that they'd be like, um, they'd come back.
[04:25.66]So, there was the Halid Tree.
[04:30.95]is up here.
[04:32.01]Oh, that's right.
[04:32.51]I did that thing too.
[04:33.13]Okay.
[04:34.39]So there was the Haligtree.
[04:36.04]I could keep going down or I could do this crumbling thing.
[04:43.92]And I think that somebody said there was an actual, probably a better way to do it.
[04:47.94]Should I start at the Haligtree or should I start at the crumbling place?
[04:54.88]Okay.
[04:55.28]So I'm trying to remember what, what the, uh,
[04:58.58]Because I killed... There was a boss here.
[04:59.78]Let's go find it.
[05:05.30]How did I miss this much?
[05:06.86]I've been streaming this a lot.
[05:07.78]This is like my favorite game ever.
[05:11.61]Okay, so let's just get back into this here.
[05:13.09]I got my moon stuff.
[05:14.93]Very nice.
[05:16.93]I think this is the wrong one.
[05:18.05]I think it's this one.
[05:19.77]This one?
[05:24.45]It's this one, right?
[05:24.92]Alright.
[05:27.94]The last thing that I did is I beat, uh... Loretta?
[05:35.24]Yes, right here.
[05:35.76]Okay.
[05:36.32]So then I could keep going that way.
[05:40.65]Now, I have not been spoiled on anything in the game.
[05:42.67]I've been trying to stay away from a lot of Elden Ring stuff, but I know for a fact that the boss that everyone hates I think is down here.
[05:54.77]Um...
[05:56.31]So, I can't tell you that I'm necessarily prepared.
[05:58.94]I'm going to turn around and do something else if I can't do it.
[06:03.32]I think I can level up.
[06:06.46]Maybe I can.
[06:09.62]So, this stream is going to continue.
[06:11.52]It's still pretty early.
[06:13.44]I imagine I'll be able to play... What time is it?
[06:17.30]Maybe like three or four hours?
[06:19.18]See?
[06:23.48]I need some souls.
[06:24.54]Alright, well, let's just go.
[06:25.32]Whatever.
[06:26.65]Two headphones going in.
[06:33.54]This is just not going to do.
[06:34.44]Okay, there we go.
[06:34.86]Alright.
[06:36.16]Halleck tree time.
[06:36.94]Let's go.
[06:37.26]How's the volume?
[06:44.47]Is it good?
[06:47.63]It's going to play for six hours.
[06:49.55]What is going to go until I don't feel like it?
[06:58.35]Interesting.
[06:58.77]Alright, so that's the Haligtree.
[07:00.03]So what the fuck is the Haligtree?
[07:01.45]Is somebody going to tell me when I go down here?
[07:02.65]I can't.
[07:12.08]I don't think I can jump to there.
[07:15.26]Jerm, are you EST or PST?
[07:16.60]I am PST.
[07:22.77]I think we need fucking stylite dead.
[07:25.73]Yes, we do.
[07:29.18]G4!
[07:30.62]G4 RAID!
[07:31.50]G4 TV!
[07:33.00]What's going on?
[07:36.46]I was probably scaring the shit out of people.
[07:39.04]I'm sorry.
[07:43.13]I may have just scared the absolute shit out of all of you, and I'm really sorry.
[07:46.47]G4 just raided.
[07:48.69]G4 raided before, too.
[07:49.93]Thanks, G4.
[07:52.53]Thank you.
[07:52.87]That's cool.
[07:58.25]I'm sorry.
[07:58.73]I scared the shit out of you.
[07:59.93]I'm really sorry.
[08:02.15]No, thanks for the raid.
[08:02.87]You just missed me, uh, excuse me, crowned as the bro versus bro against Ludwig Championship.
[08:11.58]I just, I just won.
[08:12.50]Spoiler.
[08:16.54]Ooh.
[08:16.98]Ooh, okay.
[08:22.16]Ancient dragons.
[08:22.84]We're at the end of Elden Ring.
[08:24.24]So, those of you that came from G4, just be aware.
[08:26.66]This is, like, the last, probably, third of the game.
[08:31.17]If you don't want to be spoiled or anything, just, I would run away now.
[08:34.31]Immediately.
[08:34.81]Because you're going to see some shit that you might not want to see if you haven't gotten this far.
[08:39.51]And I know a lot of people haven't gotten this far.
[08:42.09]Because the game is, like, 500 hours long.
[08:44.35]So, I get it.
[08:45.95]Should I go down?
[08:56.19]Yeah, and if those are the new viewers, we always have to have fucking Starlight on.
[09:00.35]Helps you see a lot.
[09:01.23]That's a good tip.
[09:03.60]Yeah, they had this misspelling here.
[09:06.08]I don't know why it's spelled that way.
[09:08.62]It has to be S-T-A-H.
[09:11.12]I think that's somebody fucked up.
[09:13.70]Elpheal, Brace of the Haligtree.
[09:23.62]Both of my weapons are max level.
[09:26.74]So unless I change what I'm doing here, I don't have any need to go back and upgrade.
[09:33.06]Shit.
[09:40.89]These are those knights.
[09:49.85]Alright, Starlight's kind of getting in the way.
[10:00.08]Starlight actually is bad.
[10:01.22]I gotta get back in the swing thing.
[10:04.72]It's been a while.
[10:06.12]It's been like four or five days.
[10:17.13]I gotta remember what the buttons do.
[10:27.62]Oh shit.
[10:34.96]Jerma, please make your facecam bounce around like the Windows screensaver.
[10:38.18]Why would I do that?
[10:41.87]I still don't have enough.
[10:52.27]Whoa!
[10:52.65]My god!
[10:53.03]You are alive again.
[10:53.94]Oh well.
[10:54.20]Just kill him.
[10:55.16]Actually, I need to do this so I don't get mad and I lose my souls.
[11:01.50]That was dumb.
[11:10.19]Alright.
[11:10.43]I gotta get back in this point of things.
[11:13.27]It's like warm up.
[11:13.83]You don't just like go out and throw 9 innings.
[11:16.99]I gotta go to the bullpen and like warm up for like 10 minutes.
[11:21.25]You know what?
[11:21.90]You can't just go out and pitch 9 innings.
[11:24.26]You gotta warm up.
[11:25.54]You gotta go through the fucking rotation.
[11:30.68]Why are we coming in with a raid?
[11:31.52]A YouTube raid?
[11:34.75]What's up guys?
[11:38.47]Bro versus bro champion.
[11:40.73]Okay.
[11:45.86]Where are the souls?
[11:48.77]Okay.
[11:49.03]Alright.
[11:49.29]I got to pay attention.
[11:54.63]Don't get the souls.
[11:55.41]Don't lose 100,000 soulslike an idiot.
[11:56.59]Alright.
[11:59.17]Warm up is happening.
[12:02.33]Walk onto him.
[12:08.96]Alright.
[12:10.42]Do I have enough to level up so I can stop doing this?
[12:14.20]No.
[12:14.76]God damn it.
[12:15.32]Okay, just kill one thing out here.
[12:16.62]There's got to be a random person or something out here.
[12:21.24]There we go.
[12:21.68]Okay, this is better.
[12:26.17]I should have called him.
[12:28.93]I don't care.
[12:35.19]There we go.
[12:35.75]Level up.
[12:36.13]I'm sure I put it in too.
[12:40.58]Yeah, welcome, guys.
[12:42.28]Thanks, Lubbock.
[12:45.62]Always a pleasure.
[12:46.24]Spend some time with Ludwig.
[12:49.46]Probably mind.
[12:49.90]I want my mana.
[13:01.71]Alright, let's go.
[13:08.01]Why did he blow up?
[13:21.72]Put this away.
[13:26.18]I gotta get my gaming juices going.
[13:27.98]I feel like I used up a lot of my gaming juices.
[13:36.91]bird tree avatar?
[13:37.73]You're gonna need a lot of juice.
[13:48.80]That guy didn't even have an Estus.
[13:52.82]I don't even know why.
[13:53.54]He had an empty flask.
[13:56.40]I think I'm just gonna go straight for now.
[14:05.39]I could drop down there.
[14:09.25]But I could do that anyways.
[14:10.21]Let's see.
[14:10.53]Let's see what's going on here.
[14:17.19]Drink, bro.
[14:18.89]Um, alright.
[14:22.45]This goes up.
[14:24.39]Is that an enemy?
[14:25.73]Apparently it is.
[14:29.22]These guys drop a lot of souls.
[14:30.64]Holy shit.
[14:37.96]By the way, if you don't know, I am a cold wizard.
[14:43.16]Utilize ice spells, cold spells.
[14:56.49]Is he a flintstone sorcerer?
[14:57.69]Well, not really.
[15:03.85]Wait, can I go up there?
[15:05.45]I can.
[15:13.76]I guess I could have dropped anyways, though.
[15:17.16]Fuck it, let's go.
[15:17.62]Let's do it.
[15:23.60]Michelin Night Sword?
[15:25.18]Alright, what is that?
[15:32.06]Strength?
[15:33.32]Dex and Faith.
[15:35.46]Sword forged by servants of Miquella of the Haligtree, with a design modeled after those carried by Carian knights.
[15:42.03]Instead of the glintstone, however, Amber from the Haligtree is embedded in the blade.
[15:46.95]A sumptuous piece, yet it has never been offered to any knight an ill-starred sword with no master.
[15:59.37]Holy Essence and fires off a golden blade projectile?
[16:01.69]That seems kind of cool.
[16:03.37]Strength?
[16:03.69]Is it a greatsword?
[16:05.41]Strength and dex.
[16:08.09]That's a cool faith sword.
[16:16.24]Do I want to go there yet?
[16:19.32]Is the item down there?
[16:20.34]Alright, I'm going to go to... Should I go down or keep going that way?
[16:25.14]I could go down there or I could go over here.
[16:31.55]I want to see what that is.
[16:34.87]Is he going to kill me?
[16:43.12]There's a stone and sword key thing over here.
[16:49.08]Is there not?
[16:49.48]No, that's where I came from.
[16:51.58]Oh, no.
[16:52.02]I wanted to go down there.
[16:52.92]Down there.
[16:53.32]Alright.
[16:59.76]There is an avatar here though.
[17:02.92]What have I done?
[17:07.16]Okay, I'm good.
[17:11.53]This is where the stone sword key is.
[17:20.42]Watch out for the crazy enemies.
[17:22.76]I got a feeling these enemies are all going to be crazy.
[17:29.72]What is this?
[17:34.36]Triple rings of light.
[17:42.23]Fires three rings of light before the caster.
[17:44.35]This is int and faith.
[17:46.13]Seen a lot of combo spells.
[17:51.67]Produces three rings of light and fires them forward.
[17:53.29]The rings of light return to a position close to the castle before disappearing.
[17:57.75]A gift from the young Miquella to his father, Radagon.
[18:04.73]Okay.
[18:10.51]Can't really use it, but... Yeah, I'm still using the baby rattle.
[18:19.59]I like it.
[18:20.93]I don't know how much longer I'm going to like it, but I know I like it right now, and that's all that matters.
[18:24.19]If I get a problem with that, then find another fucking stream.
[18:40.38]I really don't want to fight an avatar right now, but I guess I'm going to have to.
[18:58.65]He doesn't know.
[19:00.83]I actually don't, you're right.
[19:02.03]I would treat Reeves.
[19:07.24]What's in here?
[19:07.70]What do I have in there?
[19:14.40]Is it the damage boost one?
[19:16.30]It is.
[19:18.70]I think I have enough flasks.
[19:26.11]Let's top myself off.
[19:27.03]Let me try it.
[19:29.77]This is where I was before.
[19:30.67]Nice armor, dude.
[19:36.02]This is where I was before, right?
[19:37.22]I don't need to climb up here.
[19:49.30]Okay, we're good.
[20:06.05]Go, go, go, go, go!
[20:16.47]Fine.
[20:24.57]So there's people shooting that stuff over there.
[20:26.18]I just stepped on a guy's head.
[20:40.87]Is there a faster way to get over there?
[20:42.13]Because this is kind of a terrible, awful run.
[20:46.45]I'm going to assume no.
[20:48.21]So let's just go for it.
[20:51.22]Alright, so there's somebody doing that.
[20:54.42]Casting that spell right over there.
[20:58.09]Or is it just him doing it?
[21:02.79]It is just you doing it.
[21:07.69]Why are you just spamming that?
[21:18.01]Oh, come on.
[21:18.35]You don't have to be so confident.
[21:25.59]Fuck you.
[21:28.35]Oh, you do not like that cold shit.
[21:34.68]Okay.
[21:37.66]Oh, okay.
[21:43.42]Let's not get killed by this.
[21:51.94]We can grate some cheese here.
[21:52.94]If we so desire.
[21:54.74]I almost died.
[22:05.51]What's that?
[22:05.85]What do you got?
[22:10.08]Rotten staff.
[22:20.41]B and E causes scarlet rot buildup.
[22:23.69]Ceremonial staff depicting the Erdtree in its historic radiance.
[22:28.39]Festers with scarlet rot, filled by the avatars who protect the minor erd trees.
[22:34.97]It's rotten.
[22:39.71]Is there a race in here?
[22:45.03]No, there's a... But I should be fine because I have a flail.
[22:54.75]It's rotten.
[23:02.69]Newman's Room.
[23:07.96]There's an item all the way at the end.
[23:18.30]Somber Ancient Dragonstone.
[23:22.90]Door cannot open.
[23:30.82]Oh, yeah.
[23:33.79]I have got a lot of those now.
[23:34.71]You guys weren't kidding.
[23:36.07]Those pop up all the time.
[23:37.03]Alright, what about even lower?
[23:46.17]I definitely can.
[23:48.31]Not yet.
[23:48.67]Let me continue this way.
[23:55.11]This is... I could jump off from here?
[23:56.81]Man.
[24:01.62]That's really dangerous though.
[24:03.00]Alright, I need a shield.
[24:18.80]Parry shield, please.
[24:20.32]I'm not putting up with this fucking asshole right now.
[24:22.94]Parry, parry.
[24:23.89]I don't want heavy load, but I just want a little buckler.
[24:27.59]There's a little buckler.
[24:28.39]Don't I have one?
[24:31.21]Is this seriously going to put me over?
[24:37.09]Heavy load.
[24:37.71]It doesn't matter.
[24:38.63]I'm going to parry it like twice.
[24:41.87]Is that a spear or is that the staff one?
[24:47.54]Oh, that's a staff one.
[24:48.82]Never mind.
[24:49.16]Oh my god.
[25:08.15]There it is.
[25:09.51]OOOH!
[25:20.90]I thought that was a railing.
[25:25.76]I thought that was like a waist-high railing or something.
[25:41.11]I did that.
[25:41.67]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[25:42.53]No, I'm fine.
[25:43.89]Oh my god.
[25:44.49]I'm okay.
[25:48.17]Ooh.
[25:48.39]Ooh.
[25:50.32]Hold on here.
[25:56.10]Alright.
[26:02.00]We both suck.
[26:06.42]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:25.62]I don't want to drop down here again.
[26:27.12]It was terrible.
[26:27.72]Okay.
[26:33.10]This way.
[26:36.62]Through there.
[26:40.01]Don't screw this up.
[26:47.21]You seem like the kind of guy that balls with bumpers on.
[26:49.77]Yeah.
[26:52.52]I honestly think that the gutter in bowling... I don't know.
[26:57.53]It doesn't need to exist.
[26:58.21]I don't understand why it exists.
[27:04.77]It's way more fun when it doesn't exist.
[27:06.59]I mean, when there's bumpers.
[27:21.70]You seem like you take mini-golf too seriously.
[27:23.52]Well, that's inaccurate because that means I would... You're assuming I would play mini-golf.
[27:26.74]I fucking hate that shit.
[27:28.26]I hate mini-golf.
[27:30.18]Mini-golf is the most infuriating, unfun, terrible experience.
[27:35.27]It's never fun.
[27:42.19]Mini-golf seems like a good idea for the first 20 minutes.
[27:44.87]Then you realize you have to sit there for three hours and do the whole thing.
[27:50.92]Nothing here.
[27:54.45]Weird placement of that enemy.
[27:58.99]Once you get past the windmill, I'm done.
[28:02.18]I don't feel like playing anymore.
[28:07.70]I should just stop at the windmill.
[28:16.31]What the fuck?
[28:20.75]There's two of them in here.
[28:21.51]Alright, I gotta take this low.
[28:25.30]On this.
[28:39.34]Do it!
[28:39.62]Do it!
[28:39.94]Do it!
[28:43.66]Fuck you!
[28:44.22]What?
[28:46.58]My heart hurts.
[28:48.14]Oh my god, my body hurts.
[28:54.85]This is a fucking terrible place to fight you.
[29:10.50]Get out here!
[29:14.26]We're both trying to do the same dumb shit to each other.
[29:16.07]Just get out here.
[29:19.40]Fuck.
[29:20.86]Oh, fuck.
[29:22.56]Good, good, good, good.
[29:26.30]Worst fight ever.
[29:36.53]Ooh.
[29:39.07]A lot of Smithing Stone sevens.
[29:42.61]Sorry.
[29:48.66]Fight me
[30:01.42]This is back up, which I don't... There might be an item that I missed, but we'll see.
[30:05.06]Okay, up.
[30:11.67]We'll continue this way.
[30:14.17]I'm going to say we're going to continue that way.
[30:17.35]This way.
[30:21.29]He has such an ape face.
[30:22.77]An ape-like face.
[30:28.46]Do I?
[30:32.20]Kind of.
[30:36.22]I hear one of those cookie bugs.
[30:39.34]Yeah, where's the cookie bug?
[30:53.64]Don't hit the guy in front of him.
[30:55.64]Nice.
[30:58.58]Don't waste mana on this guy.
[31:06.71]There's no reason to.
[31:08.49]Yep.
[31:23.90]Grace?
[31:34.22]Ooh, I can do that.
[31:49.95]Gold fang.
[32:00.27]Looks like a building down there.
[32:01.27]What?
[32:02.71]You haven't done the nebula move once?
[32:08.09]No, because the cold move, there's not enough people to do it to.
[32:11.31]The nebula is a great move and I use it.
[32:15.13]Trust me, I do.
[32:18.96]Did I miss anything down here though?
[32:20.46]Let me just check.
[32:21.16]I feel like there's like a Grace or something here.
[32:25.14]What are you doing?
[32:37.50]Don't fall.
[32:48.50]That guy aggroed to me from downstairs.
[32:52.18]Really?
[32:54.24]I think it's safe to drop down there, but I'm not going to.
[32:55.92]Whoa!
[33:02.79]Whoa!
[33:04.03]Whoa!
[33:05.55]Okay.
[33:11.99]Well, I don't think we're going that way.
[33:13.41]Okay.
[33:16.53]Seriously, what's the range on this?
[33:17.73]I have to go from above.
[33:24.94]What's that?
[33:27.56]You missed the Grace?
[33:31.54]Did I?
[33:31.84]I'll go over here.
[33:37.56]I'll do the nebula in here.
[33:40.39]Seems like there's like five feet of lunging.
[33:47.35]This is why you don't use the nebula.
[33:48.87]This is why I didn't want to do it.
[33:50.35]Because you're on a goddamn... Oh, no!
[33:53.13]It's one of those guys.
[33:53.75]Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[34:06.22]My god, who's behind me?
[34:07.32]Oh, ladder, quick!
[34:14.09]Oh, please!
[34:14.55]I don't care if I get poisoned, just go!
[34:15.75]Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[34:18.63]I'm poisoned.
[34:19.07]Drink!
[34:19.77]Drink on the ladder!
[34:21.81]These guys are the worst enemy in the game.
[34:29.52]Those things are so... I freaked out.
[34:38.58]I actually think that's probably where to... that's the way to go.
[34:45.20]How did I get there before?
[34:46.10]Actually, I don't remember.
[34:47.58]And then down here, and then... I don't know.
[35:03.31]I don't remember.
[35:03.75]Down all the way?
[35:04.45]Can I make it from here?
[35:08.01]I think so.
[35:10.04]Alright.
[35:11.44]What about this?
[35:12.28]What's this?
[35:23.45]Seed be- ooh!
[35:30.81]Does that guy have a spear?
[35:42.76]No, it's a staff.
[35:44.04]No, it's not.
[35:44.56]Is that a spear?
[35:45.16]Okay, it's a spear.
[35:47.18]I need a- I need a shield.
[36:03.32]Holy shit, how much fucking health do you have?
[36:15.06]Oh my god, I lost 150 mods.
[36:32.14]That's my Subway order.
[36:33.16]Meatball.
[36:34.56]Just Meatball, Marinara every time.
[36:36.68]The only thing that I ever get there.
[36:38.65]Everything else is fucking dog shit at that place.
[36:41.23]Meatball, Marinara is the only good thing there.
[36:43.29]It's super basic and super simple.
[36:45.15]Not like crazy.
[36:45.97]Nothing weird.
[36:57.71]Now that I lost my souls, who cares, right?
[36:59.41]I can go wherever I want.
[37:15.22]I hear somebody walking behind me.
[37:32.40]Where is this person?
[37:34.26]This is freaking me out.
[37:38.53]The two moons.
[37:53.59]Get over here.
[37:54.15]They're above.
[38:05.96]Alright, chest!
[38:09.42]Legendary.
[38:11.26]Cleanrot Knight Finlay.
[38:20.28]Cleanrot Knight?
[38:26.10]Legendary ashen remains used to summon the spirit of Cleanrot Knight Finlay.
[38:30.54]Finlay was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia, who in an unimaginable act of heroism carried the slumbering demigod, Millenia, all the way back to the Haligtree.
[38:42.85]She managed the feat alone, fending off all manner of foes along the way.
[38:55.14]It's not going to replace Mambo, that's for sure.
[38:59.66]Really cool, though.
[39:00.64]Sounds really powerful.
[39:03.20]Sorry, we already have a best friend.
[39:07.03]I need to get Mambo to plus 10.
[39:08.15]I don't know where to get a Great Grave Glovewort.
[39:16.03]Alright.
[39:18.21]Where the hell should I go?
[39:22.71]I don't think the play is down there.
[39:24.73]It's over here.
[39:25.27]Yeah.
[39:31.81]I already did that.
[39:38.03]Okay.
[39:38.34]This part here.
[39:39.08]So you drop down.
[39:39.76]I'm just going to run to the fucking bonfire or whatever it is over there.
[39:43.70]Right.
[39:43.90]Right.
[39:44.06]Right.
[39:44.20]Okay.
[39:44.38]Okay.
[39:44.78]Okay.

[39:49.70]Quick.
[39:49.82]Quick.
[39:49.94]Quick.
[39:51.77]Before he spawns, he's going to spawn.
[39:53.29]Go!
[39:59.39]Arrows?
[39:59.71]I think I'm safe.
[40:06.41]This should take me behind the... Yep.
[40:10.11]There's a fucking avatar here.
[40:12.55]I'm running in the door.

[40:55.41]Okay, that's the strategy.
[41:16.50]I know there's a Grace somewhere.
[41:17.50]There has to be somewhere right here, right?
[41:19.19]Like, where the...
[41:24.17]Alright, same deal, except I'm running right behind that avatar.
[41:34.21]I'll come back out here and deal with this.
[41:37.13]Right there.
[41:37.53]I think we're past the avatar.
[41:39.50]Fucking, why am I looking at you?
[41:41.46]Why am I looking over here?
[41:42.30]It's behind the avatar.
[41:43.06]I know, I know!
[41:43.74]Stop looking over there!
[41:44.64]Why am I looking?
[41:45.28]I know where it is, just jump off!
[41:46.68]It's gonna kill me.
[41:47.18]Three, two, one.

[42:39.01]Stop.
[42:39.55]Moving.
[42:39.87]There it is.
[42:45.19]Beautiful.
[42:47.51]Here.
[42:48.81]Excellent fall.
[42:50.02]That's fine.
[42:53.68]Go.
[42:53.92]Brink on the ladder.
[42:55.58]Don't stop.
[42:58.94]Thank you.
[43:04.57]That went right between my legs.
[43:09.67]Alright.
[43:11.45]Right there.
[43:12.58]Here we go.
[43:13.42]One, two, three.
[43:20.40]What the fuck just happened?
[43:21.22]Did he just shoot?
[43:25.42]Thank god.
[43:37.41]I touched it, I win!
[43:42.38]I touched it, I win.
[43:55.70]Ladder goes up, but... Let's do it.
[43:59.91]Check this out.
[44:08.34]Three cannot come in here.
[44:10.48]Three is in the building.
[44:13.09]Okay, three can come in here.
[44:16.13]That's good to know.
[44:18.53]I thought you were going to get stuck.
[44:19.63]What's behind me?
[44:30.69]Alright, you can't come through here.
[44:37.29]No, I don't want to drink that potion.
[44:45.89]Where'd he go?
[44:47.34]What the fuck just happened?
[44:50.64]Where'd he go?
[44:53.84]Oh.
[44:57.86]Look at these.
[45:12.60]What do you got?
[45:17.19]Lord's Ruin and another Rotten Staff.
[45:24.71]Cross build is OP.
[45:26.19]Cross build is very powered.
[45:28.29]I'm not just going to run through this thing because I want to see what happens.
[45:33.36]There was an item or two that was over there.
[45:46.60]Works until it doesn't.
[45:47.43]I win.
[45:47.61]11,000 souls.
[45:47.91]Holy shit.
[45:48.15]Mental FUD.
[46:01.70]Waste mana on these chunks.
[46:05.65]There's another one that's... Yeah, you.
[46:10.05]Is this Breach?
[46:14.45]Really?
[46:15.43]Okay.
[46:18.60]Well, I think I can get these.
[46:25.46]And what's this?
[46:29.06]Okay.
[46:38.52]Let's see what's down here first.
[46:44.15]Can we get a bird watching corner?
[46:45.49]Nah.
[46:46.95]You can get like a sweaty guy corner.
[46:54.27]You can get a sweaty guy in a dark room.
[46:56.35]That's all I got for you.
[47:01.67]Let's use the Salloy's room.
[47:09.06]12,000 is what we need.
[47:15.12]11,800.
[47:15.14]What about frog watching?
[47:23.58]Frogs are cool.
[47:24.74]They really are.
[47:27.07]Can we watch Jimmy Neutron?
[47:33.35]No, you cannot watch Jimmy Neutron.
[47:42.90]No frog stream.
[47:43.88]No, stop.
[47:45.74]No frog.
[47:46.46]Stop it.
[47:48.28]That changed.
[47:48.71]Maybe I should turn the exposure up.
[47:50.41]What do you like that I'm sitting in kind of a dark, sweaty room?
[47:54.79]Just reminding myself.
[47:55.71]That is fucking hot in here.
[47:59.05]Turn my urinal on.
[48:10.14]No frog stream.
[48:10.94]No.
[48:15.30]Can we do an armpit check?
[48:16.28]Not on your life.
[48:21.48]Haligtree Night Helm.
[48:25.14]Helm worn by knights sworn to the Haligtree, graced by a crown of unalloyed gold, increases faith by two.
[48:44.77]I think I look good.
[48:46.39]This is pretty much what I'm going to be wearing.
[48:50.35]Alright, so what's out here?
[48:54.44]Luxiary wall?
[49:00.70]Luxiary wall this way?
[49:01.56]Can I?
[49:07.66]I'm not.
[49:15.93]I mean, I could drop.
[49:18.03]No, that's where I just was.
[49:18.93]Nah, okay.
[49:19.48]We're good.
[49:24.16]Jerry wall?
[49:25.82]Illusory.
[49:27.94]Illusory.
[49:28.58]Illusory.
[49:29.00]How do you say it?
[49:32.30]Illusory.
[49:39.91]Here.
[49:41.73]Illusory?
[49:43.85]What the fuck?
[49:46.02]Dude, let's kill him right now.
[49:48.48]Watch this.
[49:52.32]I got to kill that one first because that's the one that casts spells.
[49:55.07]So we're going to go Dark Moon.
[49:57.45]Nice.
[50:04.13]Um, I think this is just... Got this wall.
[50:25.94]Ooh!
[50:26.70]Ooh!
[50:30.48]I got it.
[50:30.76]Whatever.
[50:31.24]I got it.
[50:32.22]There's nothing else over here that I need to do.
[50:34.40]What is that?
[50:34.70]A rotten crystal sword?
[50:36.47]What was it?
[50:43.25]You fucking suck balls.
[50:47.61]Thanks, man.
[50:48.75]I appreciate it.
[50:59.26]Okay, where is it?
[51:02.04]Rotten crystal?
[51:02.74]Ooh, this is Int.
[51:03.62]Oh, it's Strength.
[51:06.16]Scarlet Rot.
[51:08.04]Sword fashion from pure crystal.
[51:09.44]A deed impossible for a human.
[51:12.30]And wreathed with powerful magic, its attack scales with intelligence.
[51:20.07]You can two-hand that?
[51:21.07]Yeah, but I... Do I want to?
[51:26.89]I have no Strength, though.
[51:27.79]I would have to respec the character.
[51:30.37]We don't need to talk about respecs until I really cannot beat certain things.
[51:34.87]What does it look like?
[51:35.49]I mean, that's really cool.
[51:44.26]It's really cool, but it is kind of just a weapon.
[51:47.88]It doesn't have anything, like, really fancy.
[51:50.02]Maybe rattle is slower...
[51:59.63]Whatever.
[51:59.91]That's cool.
[52:04.90]Keep the rattle.
[52:06.16]Oh, scarlet rod.
[52:06.84]That's right.
[52:07.82]Huh.
[52:08.78]We'll just look into that in a minute.
[52:26.29]Not going over there yet.
[52:33.00]Hero's rune.
[52:39.64]What about the moon veil?
[52:41.32]I have a ton of stones that I have not used in like 40 game hours.
[52:47.92]I can... Oh my goodness.
[52:55.08]Damn.
[52:58.99]That goes pretty deep.
[53:01.55]If I want to upgrade another weapon, I can.
[53:05.52]So I'm very, very, very capable of just going and just maxing out three other weapons if I really want to.
[53:19.28]What the fuck is that?
[53:20.32]It's one of those things.
[53:24.08]What is it doing?
[53:27.58]That was... I didn't like that.
[53:28.52]That was unsettling.
[53:29.19]I didn't like it.
[53:39.43]Is that rot?
[53:39.97]Of course it is.
[53:52.44]Holy... Oh my fucking god, he came around.
[53:55.48]Holy shit, don't die please.
[54:04.29]Just gotta go in.
[54:10.18]Hest's Glaive.
[54:12.28]Did I get one of these already?
[54:13.90]I feel like I've seen that.
[54:18.45]Have I?
[54:26.93]No, where is it?
[54:34.45]Yeah, okay.
[54:36.25]I've seen it.
[54:38.05]Didn't impress me.
[54:42.25]I can't get on the horse either.
[54:43.25]This sucks.
[54:48.12]This really sucks.
[54:51.20]Oh my god, I cannot... Alright, that's bad.
[54:56.88]You gotta be shitting me.
[54:58.02]Okay, I need some... Can you put a dagger on?
[55:10.35]Quick step, right?
[55:15.53]Do not roll.
[55:17.01]Oh, that's right.
[55:19.27]Okay, I just need to dash.
[55:21.81]Did I roll to get it off me?
[55:28.60]Alright, I need some, uh, points of interest.
[55:30.22]I'm gonna get to that.
[55:39.80]Something's alive down there.
[55:43.10]Soap time?
[55:48.10]Wow!
[55:48.26]It worked!
[55:49.74]Alright, here we go.
[55:50.32]Oh my god!
[56:04.83]Please!
[56:08.67]Please get the fuck away from me!
[56:10.43]Please!
[56:16.08]Just keep going, keep going, keep going.
[56:17.38]I can get rid of it.
[56:19.54]What are these little fucking weirdos?
[56:23.68]Don't use the fucking knife.
[56:26.40]Oh, bad.
[56:27.05]Put the fucking sword on.
[56:32.73]Put on a weapon.
[56:33.71]Get...
[56:40.59]You annoying little shits.
[56:42.11]I swear.
[56:42.51]I'm just leaving.
[56:44.41]Get me the fuck away from this.
[56:45.53]Go.
[56:45.63]Let's go.
[56:49.04]I don't care.
[56:50.28]Fuck these things.
[56:56.70]Oh!
[57:00.10]Whoa!
[57:01.42]Am I safe?
[57:15.64]That sucked.
[57:18.14]What the fuck is that?
[57:22.84]I thought I just went the wrong way.
[57:24.26]At least there's a Grace in here and it's not like somebody's sitting behind the corner.
[57:51.64]Stupid ladder.
[58:04.86]Yes!
[58:05.18]Thank God.
[58:21.16]Alright.
[58:22.80]Now what?
[58:24.40]I might go back up.
[58:30.43]Now I'm out here.
[58:31.03]I don't want to go out here yet.
[58:43.93]I can do it.
[58:44.45]It looks like I could have kept going down from here.
[58:58.75]Should I keep going?
[59:10.24]If you live in there, you're fine.
[59:13.32]What about over here?
[59:18.46]Excuse me?
[59:25.52]Go that way.
[59:31.54]More rot.
[59:33.28]That's a legendary.
[59:59.69]Ah, fuck you.
[60:04.53]Don't... What did you do?
[60:05.87]What did you just do?
[60:09.01]Oh my god, it's a... How did you miss that?
[60:10.82]I have no fucking idea.
[60:16.80]I fought a hundred of you.
[60:18.08]I'll fight you again.
[60:25.12]Holy shit, his health.
[60:35.42]Let's try it again.
[60:36.16]I want to at least get the item.
[60:44.17]At the very least, I want the item.
[60:50.03]Those things are everywhere.
[60:52.87]We get a post-death interview?
[60:55.71]Um... I don't... I don't... I don't give interviews.
[61:04.13]You have to book me, like, at least three or four weeks in advance.
[61:07.51]Sorry.
[61:07.65]I'm just gonna get the item and then run.
[61:26.07]Whoa!
[61:28.31]What the fuck?
[61:29.89]Why?
[61:30.13]That's so scary!
[61:32.52]I thought he came from the other side.
[61:33.78]Alright.
[61:35.04]Oh, great, great.
[61:36.12]Glove ward.
[61:36.88]That's what I want.
[61:37.87]That's exactly what I was looking for.
[61:40.77]Holy shit.
[61:41.39]I can get a plus 10 mambo.
[61:48.90]I got this.
[62:07.01]I can kill him I can kill this guy
[62:31.29]It's just a burn.
[62:32.17]It's a burn fight.
[62:33.91]You do dark moon.
[62:36.81]And then after dark moon, you sit up in your chair.
[62:39.83]And you just hope that your ass is not connected to your underwear.
[62:44.85]And that is now connected as well to your pants.
[62:46.89]Because the veg is sitting here sweating.
[62:49.01]Okay.
[62:58.26]Okay.
[63:02.40]Same deal.
[63:02.86]We're gonna go up here.
[63:03.44]I'm gonna do the moon, and then we're switching to the blade.
[63:06.66]And I'm gonna be prepared.
[63:07.62]We're gonna wait.
[63:08.47]Here we go.
[63:09.79]YouTuber voice.
[63:10.65]YouTuber gameplay commentary.
[63:11.71]Here we go.
[63:12.09]Okay, so we're heading this way.
[63:13.93]Okay, guys.
[63:15.15]Alright, fellas.
[63:16.69]Hey, boys and girls.
[63:17.43]Alright.
[63:17.93]Cool.
[63:18.49]Okay, here we go.
[63:53.06]Too far away?
[64:04.07]Fuck you!
[64:22.13]It's gonna explode Oh
[64:51.56]NOOOO!
[64:53.26]BLAST YOU!
[64:54.48]BLAST!
[65:07.80]It's not funny anymore.
[65:09.18]It's too hard.
[65:10.02]Just quiet.
[65:11.48]This is a fucking hard game.
[65:13.32]This enemy is in a really shitty place.
[65:15.30]He's got a ton of health.
[65:16.46]And he can... He can bounce you off the... He can knock you off!
[65:25.58]Quiet.
[65:26.08]I got it.
[65:28.08]It's like the third attempt.
[65:29.22]I should try killing it this time.
[65:33.45]I don't even want those.
[65:44.72]Who cares?
[65:45.14]I'm level 180.
[65:47.42]This shouldn't be this.
[65:48.64]I'm kidding.
[65:49.12]People are going to leave me.
[65:49.86]This guy sucks.
[65:50.52]I'm 135.
[65:50.64]I'm going to fight him from here.
[65:59.64]Really?
[66:01.00]That's really bad.
[66:16.32]Shit!
[66:20.30]Oh, my God.
[66:21.18]Why? Why? Why?
[66:34.41]Dude, why?
[66:36.51]This one doesn't count.
[66:40.43]What's going on?
[66:43.45]I gotta get out of the rod before it builds up.
[66:47.33]Kill him with it on, who cares.
[66:52.79]BWAAAAY! EEEH!
[67:00.74]What was that shit!?
[67:03.28]One of those like puppet hands that came up.
[67:13.33]Get off!
[67:25.01]You!
[67:32.32]Golden Seed.
[67:37.50]That's it?
[67:38.41]Okay.
[67:46.15]Well, that's... I mean, how many do I have?
[67:49.75]I think I have, like, three?
[67:53.88]But it's five, right?
[67:54.88]I still need two more.
[67:57.28]Totally worth it.
[67:57.92]Actually, probably worth it.
[68:00.16]Considering that I think that's the only place you can get those now.
[68:03.68]Right?
[68:04.76]I think that's the only place I've seen them.
[68:07.67]I'm just going to go back.
[68:08.31]There's plenty of other places you can get.
[68:19.50]Wait, where am I?
[68:28.03]There are a lot more?
[68:29.09]Oh, okay.
[68:32.91]Which bonfire is this?
[68:35.25]There's at least 10 surplus seeds.
[68:41.76]That makes sense, though.
[68:43.30]Considering... a kind of... Do I have enough to level up?
[68:49.88]I think so.
[68:50.96]120-something?
[68:59.86]Close, but it's not there.
[69:03.44]Well, time to lose all these runes that I just broke for no reason.
[69:08.37]Wait.
[69:09.83]Oh, wait.
[69:40.47]Is this like a castle?
[69:41.71]Like a town?
[69:42.39]Like what is down here?
[69:43.21]What is this?
[69:44.47]This is a castle.
[69:46.63]This is the Haligtree, but it's... This is like a castle.
[69:50.65]Is there a safe place to go from here?
[70:07.70]Up?
[70:08.10]Down?
[70:20.08]Okay, I could go up.
[70:21.86]Um... Oh, what's up here?
[70:24.50]Might as well.
[70:33.38]Okay.
[70:47.82]A lot of places to go here.
[70:58.68]That's high.
[71:01.45]Did I overshoot that or did I undershoot it?
[71:03.69]I tried not to overshoot it.
[71:04.77]Ah, fuck.
[71:15.01]Souls are not gone.
[71:15.85]There's no enemies here.
[71:16.59]There's going to be stupid fall deaths that are what caused me to lose anything.
[71:36.56]Okay, come on.
[71:39.51]Tarnished.
[71:47.01]Come on, fuck it up.
[71:57.20]What the fuck?
[71:58.54]Did I go- I went- I think I went through it.
[72:00.86]My character went through it.
[72:03.93]I literally went through it.
[72:05.51]He phased through it.
[72:10.55]He just did the exact same thing.
[72:11.93]Bro, I'm trying to land on the little banister thing.
[72:19.20]Did I undershoot it?
[72:22.36]I gotta go a little bit further.
[72:23.34]Hurry up.
[72:28.76]Let's go.
[72:37.18]Oh my god!
[72:38.04]I'm rushing now because I don't want to fucking run over the stupid twigs anymore.
[72:48.98]I don't want to like walk across the tightrope anymore.
[72:57.69]I get like this in games, stuff like this, where it's just like, okay, you gotta go like that way, and that way, and then down that way, and then that way, and then you're where you were.
[73:05.21]Oh, just get, I wanna just drive a car there.
[73:07.27]I just wanna get in a fucking car and drive here.
[73:09.82]Get me in a plane.
[73:11.52]Just fly it there.
[73:12.84]Just fly.
[73:13.76]Just speed hack it.
[73:32.09]Okay.
[73:33.37]I don't need the ruins.
[73:34.19]Whatever.
[73:34.52]I can go... Fuck.
[73:45.04]Fuck.
[73:46.68]Um, hi.
[73:47.54]Hi, how are you?
[73:49.65]What's up?
[73:53.45]I was in the middle of an animation.
[73:54.27]That's not fair.
[73:54.73]What?
[73:56.67]I was in the middle of an opening animation.
[73:58.07]That's not how that works.
[73:58.63]What?
[74:02.18]Where's the item?
[74:03.72]Where's the item?
[74:04.52]Did he take it?
[74:06.78]Where's the item?
[74:15.93]It didn't show up on my screen.
[74:18.23]What is it?
[74:18.49]What is it?
[74:18.71]What is it?
[74:19.59]You got it.
[74:19.99]What was it?
[74:25.54]It didn't even show up on the screen.
[74:28.34]Is it talisman?
[74:33.61]dragon crest enormously boosts physical damage negation legendary talisman of wrought iron depicting a massive ancient dragon
[74:52.18]The ancient dragons who ruled in the prehistoric era before the Erdtree would protect their lord as a wall of living rock.
[74:59.94]And so it is that the shape of the dragon has become symbolic of all manner of protection.
[75:08.05]Seems pretty good.
[75:08.49]Seems very good.
[75:17.03]Okay.
[75:18.41]That guy's still down there.
[75:30.73]I said, I said something!
[75:34.38]You can't even see me.
[75:35.32]You threw me through the... What is this curb and shit?
[76:03.01]My god, you're so annoying get out of there These guys gotta die right now They're flying
[76:32.82]Did I just go down?
[76:36.47]Sure.
[76:51.37]You lost?
[76:54.01]Yeah.
[77:08.04]That guy shoved me!
[77:22.03]Who's next to me?
[77:24.99]Nooo!
[77:26.97]Watching for the ledges.
[77:35.33]I don't have anything left in there.
[77:41.96]This place fucking sucks.
[78:02.72]That was so far too.
[78:04.14]Jesus.
[78:08.29]Go back to the stinky dragon spot.
[78:10.39]Um, I'm... I have progress this way.
[78:13.05]I need to... I want to get out of this piece of shit before I go back to the rot village, okay?
[78:20.42]I'm getting out of this piece of crap.
[78:22.44]I know I just... I said a little bit of a swear word there.
[78:27.27]That was crap, okay?
[78:28.61]Okay.
[78:43.40]What is this?
[78:44.24]I don't know, we're taking it though.
[78:45.94]This one's just going so fast!
[78:51.54]Oh shit, nice.
[78:52.52]Lost door.
[79:20.47]Alright.
[79:26.54]Here's the boss.
[79:27.06]What do we got?
[79:34.75]Here we go.
[79:38.01]Cutscene.
[79:38.71]Everybody quiet.
[80:14.82]Go running.
[80:23.88]Go running.
[80:24.28]Kick that away.
[80:24.97]That's like a gun in a movie where it gets kicked away and everyone tries to go get it.
[80:33.75]I dreamt for so long.
[80:40.48]My flesh was dull gold and my blood rotted.
[80:48.14]Corpse after corpse left in my wake.
[80:54.52]As I awaited his return.
[81:09.12]Heed my words.
[81:13.14]I am Malenia... ...Blade of Miquella.
[81:26.91]And I have never known defeat.
[81:30.87]I am Jerma.
[81:32.89]Sword of Edw- Hey!
[81:35.37]You get to do what I do!
[81:36.51]That's not fair!
[81:37.29]Fuck you!
[81:38.59]How dare you!
[82:03.57]My god, that hurts.
[82:15.30]She's healing?
[82:39.12]Do something!
[82:47.21]Bombo!
[82:47.49]Get her!
[82:54.75]Come on, Bombo!
[83:21.30]Nice, Bombo.
[83:22.09]Good.
[83:22.67]Good job.
[83:23.31]Very good.
[83:45.37]Fucking healing shit!
[83:50.07]Oh my god, this sucks!
[83:54.70]Dude, she's healing all of them!
[83:56.04]She just... She's getting back to full health?
[83:59.34]Okay.
[84:00.46]Um... She's back to full HP.
[84:05.03]I'm fucking flabbergasted.
[84:08.25]Ah...
[84:12.38]so what we have to do here is we have to um back to full health um excuse ex I'm spitz coming out of my mouth excuse me
[84:48.07]I'm dead.
[84:48.41]Okay.
[84:55.89]So, I didn't even hurt the boss.
[84:59.79]The boss was not even injured at all.
[85:01.54]So.
[85:08.32]Mambo seems like free health.
[85:11.92]In a way.
[85:13.96]I'm very curious how I'm going to do this.
[85:16.14]Use it to dodge every attack.
[85:25.03]okay let's go come on
[86:02.38]Oh, that's a bad idea.
[86:04.04]No magic.
[86:05.40]Too slow.
[86:06.78]It's too slow.
[86:12.49]How long does it do that for?
[86:16.45]Sword, like, clicks up.
[86:19.57]Oh, yikes.
[86:20.51]Oh.
[86:50.77]Boys and girls baby rattles gonna turn out to be quite a good pick here.
[86:59.56]Oh Boys and girls baby rattle is the weapon of choice for
[87:18.34]You can't stand in the air that long?
[87:24.63]Is this a fucking cartoon?
[87:26.89]Is this a cartoon?
[87:32.29]She was in the air.
[87:34.29]She jumped in the air and stood there up in the air.
[87:37.81]I was expecting her to hold a fucking sign that just said like, oh, uh-oh, and then fall.
[87:44.72]What the hell was that?
[87:45.88]Fucking goddamn cartoon shit.
[87:52.01]Alright.
[87:54.07]Baby rattle is unbelievable here because it...
[88:15.02]sloppy very sloppy
[88:43.67]Yikes!
[89:05.96]Jesus Christ!
[89:16.05]Oh.
[89:16.59]My.
[89:17.23]Fucking.
[89:17.71]God.
[89:18.11]Get back to full fucking health!
[89:48.79]How do I do something fucking weird like this?
[89:50.47]That was weird.
[90:07.37]Oh my god.
[90:24.57]Alright, even though she's gonna heal, I think Mambo's gotta come out.
[90:27.77]We also might have to upgrade Mambo to a little 10.
[90:42.51]Let's go, Mambo.
[90:50.69]Very good start.
[90:59.03]Look at that.
[90:59.37]Look at that.
[90:59.77]Look at that stagger.
[91:05.45]No, fuck.
[91:07.52]There it is.
[91:15.20]Nice.
[91:15.40]Good hit.
[91:28.25]doing anything she's healing off of them oh my god she's gonna heal okay so summons are not probably not good because she's just gonna farm health on them okay
[91:57.65]Oh, that's right.
[91:58.21]Okay, if I'm not going to be doing that much spells... And we need to... Wait, like jump... Do I have like a... What should I do here?
[92:17.21]Shield one?
[92:17.67]I think it's really heavy though.
[92:23.48]Enormously boosts physical damage negation.
[92:25.96]What about...
[92:29.51]FP, I don't really necessarily care about potent sorceries.
[92:32.49]What about... Does she do magic damage or something?
[92:36.92]What is she doing?
[92:38.10]Rot?
[92:43.60]Raid?
[92:48.52]Is there a raid?
[92:54.01]No.
[92:56.94]physical okay so charge attacks stamina reducing attacks maybe it's HP just greatly raise max HP that seems kind of cool alright let me try that and I'm also going to move flasks around let me just try it just with just purely trying to fight
[93:26.66]Rune Arc.
[93:27.14]I am not going to use a Rune Arc yet because I'm not confident enough that I'm not going to die in 13 seconds.
[93:37.78]I also probably should change my Wondrous Physique as well.
[93:40.09]Alright, let's go.
[93:41.27]No summons.
[93:46.45]No summons.
[93:56.25]Fuck you!
[94:10.14]Fuck you!
[94:11.02]Fuck you!
[94:36.06]my god eat shit so
[95:08.34]Hey!
[95:37.16]Top myself off.
[95:46.93]Oh shit!
[96:02.43]No!
[96:03.09]My God!
[96:04.23]Fuck!
[96:06.45]Jesus Christ!
[96:08.86]Oh, that was so good too!
[96:10.20]Oh, that sucks!
[96:13.02]Holy shit, this is unbearable!
[96:15.54]What?!
[96:20.98]One mistake and it's over!
[96:25.48]That was a really clean, like, first minute or two.
[96:30.45]Holy shit!
[96:34.22]If you, one, one wrong input, it's over.
[96:39.80]Holy fucking moly.
[96:41.22]Alright, come on.
[96:43.00]Holy moly.
[96:54.03]He's got to be fucking aggressive, I think.
[96:56.27]Oh, not that aggressive.
[97:00.89]Ah, sloppy fucking beginning.
[97:02.35]That sloppy shit right there.
[97:09.37]I had no stamina to dodge!
[97:11.35]Quiet.
[97:22.09]Oh, yikes, man.
[97:23.28]She's already back to fucking full health.
[97:25.26]Holy shit.
[97:30.78]God, fuck.
[97:31.50]Is this even possible to beat?
[97:35.96]Is this even physically completable?
[97:38.88]No one's beat this in the world.
[97:49.78]I saw the achievement pop up.
[97:51.00]It's at 0.0%.
[97:51.74]I was wondering, I thought it was a bug or something.
[97:55.08]0.0% of people have beat this?
[97:59.80]Jeez.
[98:13.29]You're that smart to get away from that.
[98:22.33]god it's okay when she goes you gotta just get away just dodge right immediately right when you hear the sound
[98:50.03]Oh, fucking hell.
[98:52.49]You have to be perfect at this fight.
[98:54.73]Oh my god, dude.
[98:56.21]This is gonna take 10 hours of memorizing this whole fight.
[99:10.81]Without a doubt.
[99:29.62]What?
[99:29.82]Didn't swing.
[99:31.88]It's so long.
[99:35.62]Like, one, two, three, four seconds.
[99:54.66]Stop fucking swinging!
[99:56.62]Oh my god.
[100:05.25]Holy shit, this is insane.
[100:12.40]Yeah, I'm trying, man.
[100:13.78]This is the boss that people said... Some people took like 10 days on this person.
[100:19.70]Okay?
[100:21.92]I'm doing it.
[100:22.54]This is probably a phase 2 as well.
[100:27.72]This is going to be so awful, isn't it?
[100:33.22]We're throwing caution to the goddamn wind.
[100:36.68]We're doing a full-on Burger Boy technique right now.
[100:44.64]Nevermind.
[100:54.73]Consumables?
[100:59.64]Are you guys actually voting to see if I'm going to do this in 15 tries?
[101:03.14]Add a zero.
[101:06.37]15 tries?
[101:07.89]No.
[101:08.53]No, I'm telling you.
[101:09.07]This is going to be like 100.
[101:12.95]I don't know how I would have voted for that one.
[101:15.89]Alright, here we go.
[101:16.37]Okay.
[101:30.19]Thank you for watching
[101:50.56]You fucking idiot.
[101:51.48]Seriously?
[101:52.38]Really?
[102:05.24]Shit!
[102:10.52]There's a lot of time to swing after that.
[102:18.28]Fuck you.
[102:18.72]That was the one thing you could have done to avoid that.
[102:33.85]No fucking way.
[102:34.97]Not a chance now.
[102:35.95]Oh my fucking lord.
[102:37.23]I didn't get grabbed.
[102:37.77]I thought I did.
[102:44.53]What is this?
[102:45.35]Did she dodge this?
[102:49.39]Oh, there's no fucking mana left.
[103:16.89]Okay, hold on a minute.
[103:17.69]I've got an idea.
[103:25.21]I have an idea.
[103:25.89]This is gonna work.
[103:35.46]We're doing... okay.
[103:39.08]Watch this shit.
[103:44.86]Ranni's moon.
[103:46.89]Then we're going... I'm just gonna bully.
[103:49.46]I think I can actually bring out Serpent for this.
[103:52.30]I'm going hard for this one.
[103:53.44]Here we go.
[103:54.32]This is gonna be fucking... This is gonna be a nightmare, but let's do it.
[103:56.38]Here we go.
[103:58.42]You guys ready for a nightmare?
[104:05.02]Moon.
[104:06.46]Three.
[104:08.91]Or two.
[104:09.63]I will take two.
[104:10.51]Two moons?
[104:11.97]Oh my god, just two moons!
[104:13.79]Just sit here and do moons.
[104:22.10]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[104:24.74]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[104:26.87]We have to bully immediately.
[104:28.53]Don't let her swing.
[104:29.21]Don't let her swing.
[104:32.73]Oh my God.
[104:35.67]What the fuck was that?
[104:39.72]What just happened?
[104:40.64]I don't even know what happened.
[104:46.83]She got mad?
[104:47.71]Oh, that's the play, though.
[104:50.63]That's gonna work.
[104:56.60]That is the play.
[104:58.00]It's just get in there and just absolutely stagger and bully.
[105:03.21]Let's do it.
[105:25.21]She's in there somewhere.
[105:26.03]Alright, get her, get her, get her, get her.
[105:30.49]Don't let her do anything weird.
[105:32.44]Don't let her do anything weird.
[105:33.30]Get her.
[105:37.18]Burger boy technique.
[105:40.46]Alright, back up, back up.
[105:41.58]No reason to get killed here.
[105:42.64]We're going full burger boy.
[105:46.96]Who cares?
[105:47.56]Just kill her.
[106:09.68]Back up!
[106:10.38]Back up!
[106:13.48]There's no way this works, right?
[106:15.18]There's no way.
[106:15.75]There's a phase two in there?
[106:20.95]Ow!
[106:21.11]My face!
[106:23.21]It's just phase two!
[106:24.15]There's gonna be a phase two!
[106:25.59]There's gonna be a phase two!
[106:28.65]Oh, she's gonna rip her, like, arm off!
[106:29.93]She's gonna turn into, like, a zombie!
[106:33.65]She's gonna turn into, like, a monster!
[106:34.91]Oh, it's a fucking phase two fight.
[106:37.13]I was so confident for no reason.
[106:39.57]God damn it.
[106:44.19]Okay.
[106:45.79]So that works for phase one.
[106:48.41]Phase... What do you mean, no way?
[106:52.96]That was it?
[106:53.82]No, no, it's not.
[106:54.48]Why would there be a cutscene?
[107:00.02]That works for phase one.
[107:02.26]Okay?
[107:02.70]That's very effective for phase one.
[107:06.73]What?
[107:07.27]Oh god.
[107:08.05]I knew it.
[107:08.53]Right.
[107:08.73]There's no way.
[107:23.35]Bombo, I think we're going to have to try a little harder.
[107:37.34]Bombo, you and me.
[107:40.48]Good luck.
[108:06.80]Ambo, it's been a pleasure doing business with you.
[108:12.52]What the fuck just exploded?
[108:15.96]Ambo!
[108:17.52]Ambo, don't go in there!
[108:24.39]Ambo!
[108:24.59]Ambo!
[108:33.72]Mambo, no!
[108:41.68]My game just froze!
[108:46.45]Oh, fuck!
[108:48.65]Okay.
[109:02.71]Well, we have a reliable way to get to... Let's do this smartly.
[109:09.34]I want more spell damage.
[109:15.00]I want sorceries.
[109:16.28]Boosting sorceries.
[109:18.47]Get Mambo to 10.
[109:21.23]Yes.
[109:21.97]That's exactly what we're going to do right now.
[109:23.95]Do I have any runes?
[109:28.57]I don't.
[109:31.46]How much does this cost to get you to 10?
[109:36.52]And use a rune arc?
[109:43.25]Still doing that.
[109:47.77]Okay.
[109:49.27]Wait, I can- it's you.
[109:50.01]Wait, I gotta sell.
[109:51.41]I gotta sell something.
[109:53.36]I'm thinking rune arc.
[109:55.10]Get Mambo to 10.
[109:59.88]I need to just sell, like, some crap.
[110:02.54]What do I have for junk?
[110:06.03]How much does it cost?
[110:06.85]Fuck.
[110:10.75]Shit.
[110:13.79]I just gotta go kill a few things.
[110:15.53]Do not sell the grease.
[110:19.28]Do I have a Lord's Rune?
[110:20.48]I didn't see it.
[110:20.96]Yeah, I don't have it.
[110:24.78]I'm just gonna go kill a couple things.
[110:26.84]Use rune arcs.
[110:31.73]Let me just go here.
[110:32.43]This will be easy.
[110:36.11]That fight is crazy.
[110:39.25]It's really just... Honestly?
[110:41.21]No, no, no.
[110:42.57]We're not just dodging around and dashing around.
[110:46.23]Nope.
[110:47.31]That is a DPS race.
[110:49.45]That is a kill her as fast as possible.
[110:51.44]Don't let her do any moves.
[110:57.70]Where's an easy place for me to get?
[110:58.86]Oh, I know.
[110:59.74]That Mohg place.
[111:06.07]Where is it?
[111:06.35]It's like right here somewhere, right?
[111:10.82]Dermot, you're never going to beat this boss.
[111:13.94]I feel like I got... I feel like I got close enough.
[111:17.14]I think it's... I think I can do it.
[111:28.31]All I need is like 10 bombs.
[111:29.17]Okay, we're good.
[111:41.58]But yeah, the sorcery boosting talisman... If I just go for straight up just DPS, go for it.
[111:49.79]I think it's going to be pretty possible.
[111:51.25]I think it's going to be okay.
[111:54.45]I also think that I need mana.
[111:58.41]Heals are very good, but I don't want to run out.
[112:01.05]Because that would be a disaster if I did.
[112:04.04]Okay, let's go get Mambo to 10.
[112:17.18]Here we go.
[112:23.84]Mambo plus 10.
[112:31.85]I guess I had more runes than I needed.
[112:35.47]We're also going to take a rune arc.
[112:37.23]Wait, what do I have on for a rune right now?
[112:43.43]What's the best one I can put on for this?
[112:47.50]Odrick is good.
[112:50.84]HP, FP, and stamina.
[112:52.10]Redans.
[112:52.46]I feel like that's not bad.
[113:03.25]Greatly raises max HP.
[113:11.74]I'll try Redans.
[113:14.84]Here we go.
[113:21.49]That's not very much.
[113:22.05]That's not that much.
[113:25.29]It doesn't seem like very much.
[113:26.22]Okay.
[113:29.30]Well, let's go for it.
[113:32.34]I am as prepared as I'm going to be at this point.
[113:36.02]More Goths is better.
[113:37.16]Well, I got this on right now.
[113:39.55]Rutan sucks.
[113:40.63]Alright.
[113:44.47]It's right here.
[113:48.91]Use Godrick's.
[113:52.11]I mean, I already used it.
[114:02.52]Okay.
[114:03.42]Here we go.
[114:04.66]Let's try it.
[114:05.46]The same technique.
[114:06.78]Getting in there, and we are just bully, bully, bully, bully, bully.
[114:10.11]Don't do anything else.
[114:11.47]Bully.
[114:12.67]Bully.
[114:12.99]That's it.
[114:13.37]We're not doing it.
[114:13.79]We're just bullying.
[114:14.37]Go, Mambo.
[114:48.33]Stagger, come on.
[114:48.89]Keep it up.
[114:49.71]Get in.
[114:58.56]And go.
[115:01.36]Good.
[115:06.94]Good!
[115:09.60]Bumble, help!
[115:24.13]She did it three times in a row!
[115:28.11]What the fuck?!
[115:30.79]She did that same dumbass move two or three times in a row!
[115:39.04]I lost the rune arc.
[115:39.72]I don't even need it.
[115:40.28]Fuck it.
[115:40.50]I don't want it.
[115:41.00]Not that one.
[115:51.61]Here we go.
[116:19.29]Get in!
[116:31.08]Bombo, you gotta get any closer, man.
[116:32.50]Come on!
[116:39.26]Fucking Jesus!
[116:48.77]This is a bad start.
[116:49.81]He did that move so early.
[117:08.51]Zone.
[117:08.89]Zone.
[117:09.15]Good zone, Mambo.
[117:14.81]Good zoning!
[117:31.51]Oh my god, she just kicked the shit out of him!
[117:41.30]Oh, please!
[117:46.86]Nice!
[117:54.43]God damn it, he's dead.
[117:56.85]Okay, alright.
[117:57.81]We got to phase two for the second time.
[117:59.49]I'm ready.
[118:06.19]Oh my god.
[118:07.87]Oh my god, it explodes.
[118:08.77]Oh my god.
[118:27.20]What the fuck?!
[118:30.30]What the fuck?!
[118:31.06]She doesn't come down!
[118:37.39]She stays up there?
[118:38.37]I'm just gonna run.
[118:44.63]I saw her come down, but that was just a stupid fucking phantom.
[118:47.35]Alright, no more rune arcs until I can reliably know what she's gonna do in phase 2.
[118:53.79]This is... oh my goodness, this is fucking awful.
[119:07.51]Get that backwards.
[119:23.38]I just couldn't fucking see, I'll be honest.
[119:25.46]So much red shit on the screen.
[119:44.67]We gotta keep Mambo alive.
[119:51.57]That's the stupidest fucking move in the game.
[119:56.57]Do you just have to turn around and run?
[119:58.47]He does it three times.
[120:04.95]There's no way you can get... You cannot dodge that.
[120:07.43]You just turn around and run.
[120:08.23]There's so many attack animations in one second.
[120:16.10]What's that fucking horse shit?
[120:31.18]Come on, I need you to get in there.
[120:46.63]Good start.
[121:01.75]It happens so quickly.
[121:05.55]That move happens so fast.
[121:07.09]How are you supposed to do that?
[121:14.09]Like that's... Holy... That's stupid.
[121:16.53]If she goes in the air, just run.
[121:26.22]That's dumbass shit right there.
[121:27.40]That is dumbass shit.
[121:28.62]Y'all know it.
[121:38.83]Okay, if she goes in the air, run across the entire game.
[121:41.77]Okay, I got it.
[121:52.29]She went in the air for that?
[121:53.11]It's a different move!
[121:53.85]Pombo, I need you over here.
[122:00.39]How am I paranoid that she's gonna do it?
[122:26.04]zoning back up
[122:46.83]Oh, she's actually doing it to Mambo, sorry.
[122:53.77]Poor Mambo.
[122:57.02]Oh my god.
[122:58.04]I need Mambo for phase two so bad.
[123:15.46]Oh, come on.
[123:16.10]Where's the fucking stun?
[123:21.53]She's right.
[123:22.09]You just run.
[123:23.71]It's so intense.
[123:24.95]It's hard to even fucking pay attention.
[123:26.65]There's so much going on that you can do.
[123:29.89]That, like, holy shit.
[123:30.95]It's, like, so difficult to pay attention to that.
[123:34.12]It's just like, oh my god, she's in the air.
[123:35.60]And then it's too late.
[123:36.50]It's like your brain is like, oh fuck, okay, too late.
[123:49.74]Let's try it again.
[123:56.90]This is perfect.
[124:10.85]No, it's not.
[124:24.19]No!
[124:24.79]Fucking too late.
[124:27.93]Oh my... God damn it, please.
[124:30.41]Thank God she didn't kill Mamba with that.
[124:31.65]That's actually good.
[124:44.36]Keep her there.
[124:49.12]Get her, Mamba.
[124:49.54]Come on.
[124:56.80]Yo!
[124:57.42]Bobo, stop her!
[124:58.26]Stop her, please!
[125:10.87]This is... ...un-fucking-believably difficult.
[125:13.78]Are they gonna nerf this one too?
[125:22.95]Am I gonna fight both these bosses, Verdain and this one, before they fucking nerf it twice?
[125:26.93]What did it- didn't get her?
[125:56.76]It's actually really hard to see.
[126:06.81]Oh my god.
[126:11.33]That sucks.
[126:12.09]Mambo's going to die really quick.
[126:17.92]Oh.
[126:36.10]Dude!
[126:38.04]Excuse me?
[126:38.90]I ran the whole fucking time!
[126:40.30]Hey!
[127:03.78]Whoa!
[127:13.54]You gonna go in the air?
[127:28.77]I'm so fucking afraid she's gonna go in the air.
[127:30.43]And ruin the whole thing.
[127:32.31]I need you for phase two!
[127:40.96]She's still alive?
[127:42.72]What the hell?!
[127:45.60]She's fucking healing!
[127:46.49]God damn it, man.
[127:51.95]That's such a shit mechanic.
[127:59.15]Oh my god, I can't fucking kill her!
[128:01.48]Alright, now what do I do?
[128:12.25]Oh my god...
[128:21.13]okay so she goes in the air she comes down and then she explodes how many seconds later two will that still hit you if you roll
[128:48.10]So you have to just do like two good perfect dodges, okay?
[128:52.72]I'm gonna start to hear this fucking music in my head.
[129:21.31]Don't go in the air.
[129:22.03]I have nowhere to run.
[129:35.12]Oh my god!
[129:35.78]She's coming for me!
[129:39.65]What the fuck?!
[129:43.99]I don't know which way she's going.
[129:58.10]Nooooooo!
[130:01.87]Nooooooo!
[130:20.98]Keep at it.
[130:22.30]Alright, come on, dodge.
[130:23.80]It's gonna be a good dodge.
[130:29.99]Fuck!
[130:32.63]What's the scarlet rod everywhere?
[130:33.91]There's scarlet rod all over me.
[130:44.66]Is it the same move that she does?
[131:00.16]I don't know, dude.
[131:16.25]Oh no!
[131:16.95]Oh no, she does it!
[131:18.93]Oh no!
[131:21.25]Oh, she does two different things and she goes in the air now.
[131:26.07]She does the- she does two of those.
[131:27.91]She hung up and didn't do it.
[131:29.73]Oh my goodness.
[131:31.89]Oh no.
[131:35.35]What level am I?
[131:36.01]135?
[131:37.63]Should I just come back here at like 180 and just kill her?
[131:44.55]She does five different things.
[131:45.79]I'm just running every time.
[131:47.55]Oh, this sucks.
[131:52.42]This sucks so bad.
[131:54.08]Okay.
[131:56.76]Okay.
[132:11.55]You can't.
[132:12.13]You did not.
[132:21.20]I need more bully from you.
[132:22.24]Oh, she's doing it.
[132:24.00]That's so... Dude, I gotta fucking... Seriously.
[132:28.23]I honestly like... It's like, holy shit.
[132:31.65]I just like, you get so into the fight and it's just so much going on.
[132:35.07]So much fucking colors on the screen that like she goes in the air and it's like, oh fuck.
[132:39.86]I'm just, you can shoot me in the face with a cannon.
[132:41.76]I can't fucking do anything.
[132:46.78]Use the Mimic Tear.
[132:47.42]They nerfed that motherfucker.
[132:48.58]It's not worth it.
[132:56.07]This is the strategy for Phase 2.
[132:58.15]God, I have no fucking goddamn idea how you're supposed to reliably do that.
[133:02.23]It's just, I don't think, I don't know how the fuck you do that.
[133:07.09]Dude, some of these, like, speedrun, like, no damage runs, oh my god, this is gonna suck absolute asshole.
[133:11.68]This is gonna be fucking horrible.
[133:20.74]Dude, even when you fucking run, it don't matter.
[133:34.81]Okay.
[133:55.64]I'm terrified we're going in the air.
[133:56.92]Especially if you're mid attack animation like this, it's fucking horrible.
[134:15.79]Yai yai, dude.
[134:19.73]Thank you.
[134:47.57]Oh, come on.
[134:48.93]Get out of here.
[135:06.73]Alright, come on.
[135:11.49]Get it.
[135:11.73]Don't let her go in the air.
[135:26.64]God, you piece of shit.
[135:28.46]Just get hit.
[135:31.05]Thank you, Mambo.
[135:31.63]Apparently, I can't fucking hit her.
[135:32.77]Can I go near her?
[135:44.86]Where is she?
[135:46.10]Alright, here we go.
[136:06.64]Dude!
[136:07.02]I have no more stamina to fucking move away from her!
[136:11.90]I'm out of fucking stamina!
[136:18.58]No way man.
[136:21.50]Oh Shit I don't I'm fucking dead.
[136:26.26]Oh my god I ran out of stamina Use a shield
[136:42.86]Oh my god, that sucked.
[136:44.52]How much stamina do I have?
[136:47.84]20 endurance?
[136:49.02]Yeah, but I need to... Try the boys.
[136:53.87]I feel like the boys are gonna be free food.
[137:07.82]Use the moon blade?
[137:08.62]I'm not even... I don't know, man.
[137:10.10]I gotta, like, get to phase two and not have her spam that move for the first five seconds.
[137:16.01]Like, I need to be... I gotta see what she does in that encounter.
[137:18.47]I'm just gonna run away from her.
[137:20.37]If I get to phase two here, I'm literally... I'm not gonna attack.
[137:22.19]I'm literally just gonna run around in a circle and see what she does.
[137:24.47]It was so un-fucking-bearable that, like, even if you're remotely close, you're fucked. ...
[137:42.03]Jesus, the timings are so fucked up.
[137:44.11]This is the hardest boss of any FromSoftware game, without a doubt in my mind.
[137:48.57]A million percent.
[137:50.49]I thought the end of Sekiro was fucking horrible.
[137:53.00]At least, like, I had a... At least you can, like, fucking... You have, like, a button to stop attacks.
[138:01.60]I think this takes the cake.
[138:05.00]Like that, L1.
[138:05.64]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[138:09.96]Yeah, this is a Sekiro boss without the parry mechanic.
[138:13.70]I think she accidentally got in this fucking game.
[138:15.56]I don't think she's supposed to be here.
[138:24.45]They like accidentally put the wrong asset in here.
[139:05.46]I'm so paranoid of that move, I don't even want to, like, fight her!
[139:20.08]so so
[139:37.67]Good job.
[139:55.71]DUDE!
[139:55.95]FUCK YOU WITH THIS FUCKING GAP CLOSING BULLSHIT!
[139:59.17]OH COME ON NOW!
[140:00.49]GODDAMMIT!
[140:03.45]ALL THESE GAP CLOSES!
[140:06.48]Where's my fucking Sekiro L1?
[140:08.08]Wrong game!
[140:12.64]Wrong game FromSoftware!
[140:13.48]Wrong game!
[140:36.52]He's going crazy.
[140:37.28]I'm gonna turn around, man.
[140:38.78]Fuck this part.
[140:40.70]I'm gonna hack my game and fuckin' get 10,000 damage just giving her a killer with one hit.
[140:56.59]Get her in the fire.
[141:07.18]Ugly.
[141:07.68]She's going to go in the air.
[141:08.52]I just know it.
[141:10.64]It's just like, fuck, you don't know when she's going to go in the goddamn air.
[141:13.28]And it's like, man, you better not be within fucking 100 yards of her.
[141:18.69]Fuck.
[141:35.59]I was stupid, but I'm gonna do it.
[142:05.64]No!
[142:10.58]Why did that not stagger?
[142:41.93]Oh, fuck!
[142:52.26]Come on.
[143:03.56]No, get back- back up, back up, back up, back up.
[143:05.28]Back up.
[143:05.60]Alright, what are you- what are your moves?
[143:09.97]What are your moves?
[143:16.36]Oh my god!
[143:16.98]She's doing that thing!
[143:17.94]It's different!
[143:19.02]What?!
[143:20.69]That was different!
[143:21.35]She didn't do the thing!
[143:22.51]That was different.
[143:38.63]I don't even know when to attack!
[143:41.36]Please!
[143:44.00]Do moves so I can learn what you do?
[143:52.26]Please get away from me.
[143:56.82]I'm such a coward.
[143:57.76]I don't care.
[143:58.16]Oh, it's over.
[143:59.52]Goodbye.
[144:04.15]Dude.
[144:05.43]Oh.
[144:06.71]Oh, my genuine scared face.
[144:13.95]There's not even enough time for me to change to my other potions.
[144:16.89]You know what I mean?
[144:17.60]Like, fuck this.
[144:21.92]Okay, it's more, it's like a lot, it's been really drifty and floaty.
[144:58.10]Shit!
[144:59.44]Shit!
[145:00.30]Oh my god!
[145:01.32]There's no time!
[145:02.44]Oh my god!
[145:05.18]What are you supposed to do?
[145:07.10]There's no time!
[145:08.08]There's no time!
[145:09.72]There's no time!
[145:16.57]There's no time!
[145:18.53]By the time she finishes that move, she's doing another- she's doing it again!
[145:25.14]What the fuck, dude?
[145:30.74]You should use your melee art.
[145:31.80]Dude, I'm going to do that and die instantly.
[145:39.49]I don't think I can do... I think that move is too slow.
[145:41.29]I think I just have to fight her.
[145:49.11]What fucking drugs were they taking when they made this, by the way?
[145:53.14]Oh, here's a good idea.
[145:54.02]A fight where the boss heals every time she hits you.
[145:57.21]Oh, and by the way, there's a move that goes across the entire fucking boss area.
[146:02.81]She's got no stamina bar.
[146:04.21]She swings faster than all the bosses in Sekiro.
[146:06.40]Were they smoking crack when they made this?
[146:09.00]How much crack were they on?
[146:12.84]This is crack!
[146:14.83]Alright, settle down.
[146:15.53]I'm fine.
[146:35.46]Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
[146:55.39]Mm-mm.
[147:05.17]She's gonna do it.
[147:05.95]She's gonna do it.
[147:08.15]She's just, she wants to do it so bad.
[147:10.66]A little, the math problem going on in her little fucking brain is being like, should I do the thing?
[147:15.72]Maybe.
[147:37.48]What a fucking hero that was.
[147:39.20]Nice job, Michael.
[147:41.20]Oh, kill her quick!
[147:46.96]What the fuck?
[147:48.07]She annihilated him.
[147:49.53]She fucking annihilated him, man.
[148:07.61]I'm so paranoid that she's gonna go in the air and it's over.
[148:43.07]Oh my god, it's over Oh
[149:01.56]Oh my god!
[149:02.68]That's so broken!
[149:04.52]Oh my god!
[149:16.31]I even tried to run, dude.
[149:23.99]Bombo phase two, that's probably- but I gotta get through phase one.
[149:30.59]Ambo's got to stay alive for phase two.
[149:35.19]He didn't run.
[149:36.31]Guys, she does a move that takes like 12 seconds to end.
[149:41.59]And she jumps in the air and does it within like half a second.
[149:45.63]If you're already in the gap, it's fucking over.
[149:49.73]And when, if you're too far away, you can't fight her.
[149:53.17]If you're too close, you're fucked.
[149:56.13]How do you win?
[149:57.19]What's the strat?
[150:04.54]I need to get a shield.
[150:05.40]Guys, my dude can't fucking handle a dude.
[150:09.50]Let's go.
[150:16.46]I think I need Mambo for phase one.
[150:18.04]Otherwise, I don't know if I can reliably get through this. ...
[150:47.64]Bro, I can't see when you're doing that in front of me.
[151:10.55]Hit her please bombo, please do your little spreadsheet thing and hit her don't let her get any man off you No, he's just building mana.
[151:16.49]Don't little bit.
[151:16.99]I'll get her No shit
[151:43.66]Oh no!
[151:59.65]Combo get her!
[152:22.27]There are other people in this fight, you know!
[152:48.64]Stop it!
[152:52.56]Stop moving!
[152:53.54]Oh, what the fuck?
[152:57.46]No fucking shot!
[152:59.84]No fucking shot.
[153:01.88]No shot.
[153:03.26]No shot.
[153:05.08]That's not possible.
[153:12.96]She runs faster than you.
[153:15.75]She does more moves per second than you can move.
[153:19.57]She's got the biggest gap closers of anybody I've ever seen.
[153:25.78]What a piece of shit.
[153:26.74]I look shit-faced.
[153:30.36]I look fucking drunk right now.
[153:38.04]Dude, I know.
[153:38.54]Okay, I understand.
[153:39.28]Like, just dodge.
[153:39.88]Just dodge.
[153:41.16]Being perfect in a Souls-like... This is a fucking FromSoftware game.
[153:44.70]Why am I saying that?
[153:46.66]You can't be perfect, man.
[153:48.18]Like, it's just too hard.
[153:49.38]It's too much.
[153:52.27]But even if you were perfect... I want to, like, watch that clip of what just happened.
[154:00.31]Because, god damn, it's like... Attack.
[154:02.76]Attack.
[154:03.64]Attack.
[154:04.00]Attack.
[154:04.92]Attack, attack, attack.
[154:06.14]Attack, attack, attack.
[154:07.18]You... There's no time to do anything.
[154:09.86]You physically cannot do anything.
[154:11.98]Besides just get hit.
[154:16.72]Watch somebody do a no-hit of this.
[154:18.94]They're fucking... They're working in slow motion.
[154:21.40]I already went over that.
[154:26.16]Ah.
[154:49.38]Oh, it's over.
[154:56.22]Fuck me.
[154:56.48]Thank god.
[155:05.29]I love when he hits her.
[155:06.03]It sounds like a trash can lid.
[155:11.95]He's using a trash can!
[155:34.64]No, don't go for me, please!
[155:39.06]I'll never turn you back on, Mambo.
[155:40.32]Big fucking mistake.
[155:46.07]Did I run out of stamina?
[155:46.67]I might have.
[156:05.26]Oh shit!
[156:21.84]Oh boy!
[156:33.87]Bro!
[156:41.89]What's this?
[156:46.91]What's this shit?
[156:53.13]God dammit, fuck you, dude!
[157:05.32]Jesus Christ!
[157:08.25]What the fuck?!
[157:12.05]What?!
[157:25.18]Panic roll?
[157:26.62]Those are the amount of rolls you have to do to not get hit by that?
[157:30.08]Dumb!
[157:31.26]Fucking... That's so fucking annoying!
[157:41.48]This piece of shit is dead eventually, and we're gonna eat one of these.
[157:46.10]Oh, I'm so mad!
[157:47.42]It sucks!
[157:47.79]This sucks!
[157:48.81]This sucks!
[157:50.03]This sucks!
[157:51.09]This sucks!
[158:23.73]I had no stamina to run!
[158:47.87]I hate when you do this shit.
[158:50.37]Fucking do something.
[158:53.35]Do something!
[158:53.83]What are you, a player in PvP?
[158:55.43]Fuck off!
[158:55.95]I thought he just cut her head off.
[159:17.56]Thank you.
[159:47.69]Please help me and kill her.
[159:48.73]Please help me.
[160:00.25]Get out of the rock.
[160:01.29]Get out of the rock.
[160:23.69]Fuck you.
[160:36.54]Oh fuck, it's so much slower.
[160:50.63]Oh my god, I thought it was the other one!
[161:07.19]Is it- which one is it?
[161:14.80]The fact that she goes in the air and she does two different fucking moves.
[161:18.63]She does the like, here I am floating.
[161:22.41]Or, or it's like, whoosh.
[161:27.59]How are you supposed to tell?
[161:28.81]How are you supposed to tell?
[161:31.65]How are you supposed to fucking tell?
[161:33.75]Different poses.
[161:34.55]Oh yeah, she goes, instead of going like this, she goes like this.
[161:59.33]This is stupid.
[162:06.10]I think it's 100 degrees in this room.
[162:09.50]I'm like being cooked in here.
[162:12.46]I'm being cooked alive in here.
[162:16.72]If there was a piece of meat on my shoulder, it would be turning brown.
[162:19.92]It would be like browning.
[162:22.70]It would be like, oh, I could probably eat it.
[162:34.90]This fight sucks.
[162:48.20]so so so so
[163:17.19]Thank you.
[163:51.30]Thank you.
[164:19.13]Oh fuck!
[164:46.58]God damn it, I don't know how many fucking people do that!
[164:48.98]And she's doing the fucking thing again.
[164:50.30]Oh my god, I couldn't even see!
[165:05.91]Oh my goodness.
[165:11.90]Too many moves.
[165:12.78]They gotta take away one of those swings.
[165:14.90]It's so fucked up.
[165:29.59]Bombo for phase two only?
[165:30.93]Alright, I'll try that.
[165:32.75]Can I even do that though?
[165:33.79]I feel like I'm gonna get my ass kicked right now.
[165:38.64]No, I don't want to- Listen, I'm not using the stupid Mimic Tear.
[165:41.88]Quiet!
[165:47.97]I demand silence!
[166:32.02]That was a good one.
[166:53.64]Oh, fuck, no!
[166:54.36]I forgot what that move was for a second.
[166:55.68]Yeah, I forgot.
[166:56.38]I, like, forgot that.
[166:57.08]Because I didn't have Mambo.
[166:59.10]Like, this is the first time I've seen her without Mambo, and, like, I just forgot.
[167:09.67]So when FromSoftware makes another game, right?
[167:13.97]What do they do?
[167:15.43]Do they just... Okay, does their next game, it's like, oh, we have to do something harder than Millenia.
[167:20.88]The two hands come out of the fucking screen and just choke you and just push on your trachea.
[167:26.84]What's next?
[167:28.28]What do they do?
[167:30.72]You know what I mean?
[167:31.20]Like, oh, yeah, I'm at the final boss.
[167:33.51]Oh, wow, one of the final bosses of, uh, of, uh, Slash Arc.
[167:40.35]Wow, I'm here.
[167:41.85]What's up with these hands?
[167:43.49]Whoa, guys, do you see these hands?
[167:46.35]Ah!
[167:47.13]Ah!
[167:47.77]Ah!
[167:50.18]Oh, I dodged!
[167:50.72]Did you just fight the fucking hands?
[167:55.94]What's next?
[168:04.03]What the fuck is next?
[168:12.05]Oh yeah, FromSoftware, it's a new game.
[168:14.63]It's called Nut Kick.
[168:19.30]Like something just kicks me in the balls from under the desk.
[168:28.35]What else are they going to do?
[168:29.21]How are they going to do anything else?
[168:44.88]It smells in here.
[168:46.28]It fucking smells in here.
[168:49.62]I can tell you right now, it stinks in here.
[168:52.04]No, I'm kidding.
[168:58.79]No, I didn't shit my pants.
[169:07.86]Imagine setting up...
[169:10.55]Oh yeah, this game, Nut Kick.
[169:11.89]Yeah, it's like a thing down here.
[169:13.39]I just like sit there and here comes the boss.
[169:17.65]Why would you set that up?
[169:19.51]Why would you wouldn't even buy it?
[169:26.83]Oh fuck, I'm gonna die.
[169:30.05]I'm fucking dead.
[169:30.97]Okay, this one's a real try.
[169:36.78]Right here.
[169:47.61]Everyone warned me, oh, hey dude, I know you're like, yeah, yeah, hey, by the way, like, go in there at 150, by the way.
[169:53.00]Don't, hey, listen, fucking dude.
[169:55.92]Don't listen to these fucking idiots in the chat, man, I'm telling you.
[169:58.96]Be a fucking level 150, get your fucking vigor up to fucking like 60.
[170:03.36]That's how I did it, dude.
[170:04.14]Don't fucking listen to these dudes.
[170:06.02]They're trying to get you killed and they think it's funny when you die.
[170:09.18]Look, trust me, I'm a fucking nut kick pro.
[170:12.20]I just sit there and let it kick me.
[170:15.27]Listen to me, I got all the fucking tips.
[170:19.56]I did world first get nut kicked fucking a hundred times.
[170:24.22]Yeah, that's me.
[170:24.72]Yeah, I got that.
[170:25.36]I got that record.
[170:25.96]It's a speedrun record.
[170:31.76]Why am I just doing moons?
[170:32.86]I think I might be out of it.
[170:34.62]I think I might have to take a break.
[170:36.30]This might be break time.
[171:12.07]Oh, here it comes!
[171:13.55]Oh, I'm gonna go for the record!
[171:46.57]I gotta turn the fan up.
[171:52.17]Okay.
[171:53.81]So what went wrong there?
[171:58.83]There's too many, so many memes tonight.
[172:00.75]Oh, sorry, G4.
[172:02.57]Right?
[172:02.79]Are you still here?
[172:05.17]Hope not.
[172:06.75]I hope that, I hope not.
[172:08.96]Thanks for the raid.
[172:09.54]That was like an hour and a half ago.
[172:11.74]That was two hours ago.
[172:13.52]Am I saying thanks for the raid to G4?
[172:16.92]Two and a half fucking hours later.
[172:18.60]Are you drunk?
[172:20.16]Alright, this is the one.
[172:22.19]We're bringing out Mambo for first round because whatever.
[172:24.47]I'm pissed.
[172:26.19]That was four hours ago?
[172:27.31]How long have I been here?
[172:28.53]Come on, Mambo.
[172:34.69]Get in there.
[172:39.86]Did that actually miss?
[172:42.14]Oh, fuck it.
[172:43.94]Come on.
[172:44.20]What the fuck?
[172:55.87]No, she's gonna... That sucks when she does it to Mambo.
[173:02.23]Because then Mambo's not going to be around for the second phase.
[173:18.67]He's almost out of health again.
[173:25.76]Again?
[173:57.01]See?
[173:57.35]See?
[173:58.75]See?
[174:26.82]Oh come on!
[174:41.52]Let's go.
[175:27.41]Oh my god, I couldn't- I'm trying to change my fucking sword!
[175:33.09]Oh my god, dude.
[175:35.98]Like, holding Y, like, I gotta fucking complain.
[175:40.73]Like, holding Y and hit R1 to go to two-hand, man, sometimes, like, it just, like, fucking is weird.
[175:48.15]It doesn't, like, happen.
[175:49.51]In the lower left, it doesn't, like, say, oh, you're holding Y. It just thinks you're tapping Y.
[176:15.11]I mean, like, to switch your weapon, you have to, like, one... It's like a full second that you have to hold it.
[176:23.12]It's like, hold, there it is.
[176:24.28]Hold, there it is.
[176:25.60]So...
[176:44.27]Oops.
[176:48.03]You're already running?
[176:48.85]What's this bullshit?
[176:49.85]You never run!
[176:50.87]You knew I used a rune arc, you piece of shit!
[176:53.86]Shit!
[176:54.70]Shit!
[176:55.62]Shit!
[176:56.66]Shit!
[176:57.24]What was that?
[177:00.00]You piece of shit!
[177:06.67]You missed.
[177:08.64]I'm gonna fucking use the rune arc.
[177:19.69]I'm gonna shit my pants.
[177:21.57]I'll give this one more try and I'm going to... What time is it?
[177:41.98]Don't shit your pants.
[177:42.72]I'm gonna if I want to.
[177:44.16]And I might, I just might.
[177:46.04]I might just fucking, you know what I mean?
[177:47.62]Like, just...
[178:07.00]You can't see what's happening in that fight.
[178:14.15]I'm just freaking out, man.
[178:37.76]What are you doing?
[178:38.84]Don't do it.
[178:43.88]One of us has to fucking do something, so... No, I forgot!
[178:54.15]I'm so... I can't... I can't even fucking... Man, that's, like, my brain is just, like... For some reason, I thought, like, she was in phase two.
[179:02.64]I was gonna do the swoop.
[179:14.25]Alright, last one.
[179:14.77]This is the last one.
[179:21.01]This is ridiculous.
[179:21.81]This is, like, truly a fucked up encounter.
[179:28.21]This is fucked up. ...
[179:45.65]Only... Only... She's not natural right now.
[179:49.51]Right.
[179:52.27]Nice camera.
[179:56.85]Oh, there she is.
[179:57.45]I found her.
[179:57.83]Okay.
[180:15.00]One, two, three, go.
[180:16.95]You're scary.
[180:17.81]I'm not scary.
[180:18.62]I'm having fun.
[180:19.28]I'm not having any fun.
[180:28.98]I'm not, what are you, why do people call me horrifying?
[180:31.70]It's a, what, you haven't seen anybody go, ah, what the heck?
[180:35.50]Oh shit, a boss in Dark Souls, what the fuck, dude, it's scary!
[180:39.52]I'm not the only person that's done this.
[180:42.70]There are tons of us that get very heated and very upset at these games.
[180:46.28]I don't know what you're on about, because I know for a fact that at least...
[180:57.16]Blade of Miquella.
[181:14.94]There's no way I would be able to do this when I'm 40.
[181:17.48]No.
[181:18.68]Okay, here's the thing, guys.
[181:21.04]Listen to me.
[181:22.16]If FromSoftware comes out with another game in, like, four years and I'm still streaming, we're just gonna skip that one.
[181:27.98]We're just gonna skip that.
[181:28.84]I'm not gonna be able to do it when I'm 40.
[181:31.62]I don't know.
[181:31.94]This is the last time that I think I'll be able to beat, like, a fucking FromSoftware boss.
[181:40.66]When I'm 40 years old, I'm gonna be, like...
[181:43.27]I'm gonna have to count when I dodge, you know what I mean?
[181:45.61]Like, oh, one!
[181:46.57]Two!
[181:47.53]Alright, let's go.
[182:05.30]Yeah, good luck to all of you.
[182:07.81]Good luck to all of you sorry motherfuckers that are gonna have to play the next FromSoftware game and go up against, um, uh, Mileena, the, uh, the maggot, and, and, and deal with the harder boss they make, because it's gonna be harder than this.
[182:21.26]Good luck.
[182:29.60]I'm gonna be on the sidelines.
[182:31.38]I'm gonna be like, oh shit, man, I'm glad I'm 40 and I don't have to do this.
[182:41.01]What happened?
[182:41.53]I wasn't even looking!
[182:44.65]Did I win?
[183:15.86]No, not again!
[183:16.36]Not again!
[183:58.99]Get in there, Mambo!
[183:59.81]Come on!
[184:00.59]Come on, son!
[184:06.31]Come on, son!
[184:11.76]Oh.
[184:12.70]My god.
[184:13.38]It's like... One.
[184:18.26]Two.
[184:19.28]If you can't... It's so hard to see them.
[184:24.02]One does like a thrust.
[184:25.72]It's like three that are like one, two, three... Thrust!
[184:29.24]The thrust one is like... It comes like from here.
[184:33.02]Oh, this sucks such ass.
[184:36.51]It's past your bedtime?
[184:37.49]No, it's not.
[184:42.60]This is the actual last try.
[184:50.37]You take too much damage, then you die.
[184:51.93]Um, no, not really.
[185:09.84]I didn't even see it.
[185:36.08]Too much stuff on the screen.
[185:36.92]He's gonna die from that.
[185:43.75]That sucks, man.
[185:46.01]I, like, need him for Phase 2.
[185:50.25]I'd rather she do that to me.
[186:02.14]Keep at it.
[186:14.15]so so so
[187:02.10]Fuck.
[187:04.80]Oh, this is bad news.
[187:06.24]Really bad.
[187:06.76]I was up to such a bad spot.
[187:09.60]Oh, my God.
[187:10.50]Like, how?
[187:11.70]Man.
[187:12.04]I was just underneath her.
[187:16.53]More roll, dude?
[187:17.51]It's just... That move is fucking impossible to get away from.
[187:22.01]I was like right there as you're just too close.
[187:27.38]I could dodge through it, but man you gotta dodge through it like three or four times and not get hit at all.
[187:43.24]I want to beat this, but it's so un-fucking-bearable.
[187:54.66]That's un-fucking-bearable.
[187:59.18]No.
[188:04.10]You need the cheering and inspiration?
[188:05.86]I need the boss to not do 10,000 animations before I get to drink out of my flask.
[188:14.41]That wasn't to you.
[188:14.97]That was towards Melina.
[188:16.79]That was towards Melina.
[188:18.03]That was not towards you.
[188:18.85]I'm going to make that very clear.
[188:20.85]That was a growl towards Melina.
[188:23.11]Very upset with her.
[188:33.39]I'm gonna do something with my eyes closed.
[188:34.45]Fuck it, who cares.
[188:35.09]This boss sucks.
[188:36.21]Might as well try to do it without fucking looking.
[189:22.74]What's happening?
[189:48.94]I thought that was me that died.
[189:52.26]What happened?
[189:53.57]What?
[189:56.99]What the fuck happened?
[190:11.34]You were stuck in the corner?
[190:13.12]Oh, I was like, why am I alive for this long?
[190:21.39]Jump over that move.
[190:22.15]Write that down and put it on the wiki.
[190:23.97]I look fucking horrible.
[190:46.83]I need more stamina.
[190:47.93]I need- I'm gonna respect it.
[190:49.25]I'm gonna respect it.
[190:51.09]I'm just fucking around now.
[191:04.72]Get a bleed weapon?
[191:07.79]I don't want to go get the Mimic Tear, go get a plus 10 bleed weapon, sit in the corner, fire arrows at her in phase one, go get the summon that is like the cheese for this, and just stand there and win for free.
[191:26.06]What the fuck happened here?
[191:35.55]Traveler's clothes?
[191:51.09]What do I do now?
[191:55.98]You're already doing a cheese strat.
[191:57.30]What difference does it make if you do another cheese strat?
[192:01.04]Okay.
[192:03.16]You came in here with 10 dex, 10 strength, 10 vitality, 40 endurance, and you dodged every single attack, and you did like 14 damage a swing.
[192:17.69]Good.
[192:19.85]I don't want to do that.
[192:21.92]I want to kill this person.
[192:24.76]Malenia.
[192:25.72]Malenia.
[192:26.66]Malenia.
[192:27.56]Malenia.
[192:28.48]Malenia!
[192:29.56]Malenia!
[192:31.10]Excuse me.
[192:32.38]Malenia is who I am referring to.
[192:36.43]Don't fucking twist my shit around.
[192:39.32]I want to kill this person.
[192:41.14]I want to kill Malenia.
[192:42.74]I want to kill this person as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
[192:46.40]That's sorceries.
[192:48.65]That's lightning moves.
[192:51.79]I don't want to dodge every attack.
[192:54.15]I want to kill this person as fast as possible.
[192:59.17]I want Malenia.
[193:00.71]I don't want to dodge every attack.
[193:02.62]I want to sit there and fucking annihilate.
[193:06.50]He hates Malenia's.
[193:08.12]Oh, it's... You're making me very upset.
[193:16.90]Okay.
[193:17.68]So, we're gonna go.
[193:18.39]I just so badly want to just... Malenia needs to die.
[193:21.99]As fast as fucking possible.
[193:23.35]I want to kill him so bad, I want to go back in there and fucking get... But I can't.
[193:28.31]It's like a Ouija board right now.
[193:29.55]Like, I want to go in that room and do it!
[193:36.27]But I'm gonna go over here instead.
[193:51.22]You keep making it- No!
[193:52.48]You know it's- Don't twist my words!
[193:59.97]Okay.
[194:08.14]After playing against Millennium, these guys actually kind of feel like I just... Let's go.
[194:45.61]Wrong... wrong version.
[194:58.16]Beastman's Curve Sword?
[195:03.50]I'm gone.
[195:04.68]Like, there's no way you get that close.
[195:27.37]What is even over here?
[195:31.49]Hey, no attention.
[195:32.55]I didn't do anything.
[195:33.28]Did you beat Millenia?
[195:36.20]Yep.
[195:40.58]It actually wasn't even that bad.
[195:43.53]It's weird.
[195:43.99]I just pressed R1.
[195:45.81]I didn't even move.
[195:47.21]I just pressed R1 like this.
[195:50.89]I just staggered her a bunch of times.
[195:52.81]It was crazy.
[195:57.17]I think I fucked something up because it was like... Eventually, she was like... I think I crashed the game a little bit, but whatever.
[196:08.06]I'll take the win.
[196:08.58]I don't care.
[196:09.24]She was frozen going like that.
[196:13.30]It's pretty cool that I got, like, the men.
[196:14.94]It was so weird to watch.
[196:16.90]It was.
[196:17.16]I was fucked up.
[196:17.64]I just walked off the edge.
[196:31.28]Sounds like the game's fault.
[196:34.54]No, I'm fine.
[196:35.32]Don't worry.
[196:36.92]I'm fine.
[196:37.80]I knew going into that that I was gonna be fucking hell.
[196:42.66]Have I been up here already?
[196:51.94]I am going backwards, yeah.
[197:06.29]Okay, yeah, I remember this.
[197:12.45]And it's down here and straight ahead.
[197:17.29]Find Grace.
[197:21.16]It is that one, so... Wait.
[197:25.26]I killed the dragon that was out here.
[197:27.00]Alright, yeah, so I gotta go this way.
[197:29.84]Here?
[197:30.06]This one, Tempest Facing Balcony?
[197:42.72]There's a dragon over there.
[197:54.43]The fuck is that?
[198:21.55]I'm gonna get some water.
[198:22.35]I'll be right back.
[198:23.65]Fuck.
[198:24.55]I'm gonna fucking freak out.
[198:26.91]I so badly want to go to that bonfire and just go in the door and kill Millenia.
[198:30.73]You know what I mean?
[198:32.63]That's all I can think of.
[198:34.24]Except my head rent-free.
[198:35.64]Just stare.
[198:36.84]I see her face.
[198:37.74]I'll be right back.
[203:07.37]seat's wet.
[203:10.05]Wet seat.
[203:11.87]I wish that was a joke.
[203:14.13]Okay.
[203:27.91]Well, that Malenia was fun.
[203:31.59]This dumbass game.
[203:33.55]I'm kidding.
[203:33.97]I like it.
[203:37.46]Uh, so... I don't want this to be loud, because... I'm gonna mute, actually, because I hate when this hurts.
[203:50.19]You know like that, like, BOOM, when you break a, uh, seal?
[204:00.60]Really loud.
[204:03.80]Just a little one, just one of these little...
[204:19.74]This is fun.
[204:20.18]This is fun.
[204:39.81]Irma, are you afraid of turning a gas stove on?
[204:41.44]No.
[204:41.50]I just don't like it.
[204:45.18]This is where I ended up.
[204:45.92]I guess I can go down.
[204:49.04]came from in there.
[204:49.84]I'm going to go down.
[204:51.56]I'm going to go over this way, I guess.
[204:54.23]Whatever this place is.
[204:58.83]I'm really, really curious if the Two Fingers have something to do with this.
[205:13.68]I was thinking about Malenia.
[205:19.36]I just want to go in there and just... You know what I mean?
[205:24.33]Who's shooting at me?
[205:35.81]Where's the golden arrow?
[205:49.54]What is the hard cap for damage stats, by the way?
[205:52.62]Are you going to fight the secret boss here or are you going to let me be stronger?
[205:59.46]Let's see what it is.
[206:02.86]I'll try whatever it is if I can do it.
[206:08.10]alright cool so what's here olden room nine that's it
[206:38.62]90 is the only true cap.
[206:40.62]Hailing falls off at 80.
[206:57.55]Somber Stone.
[206:58.35]Okay.
[207:03.80]That's weird.
[207:09.78]My whole computer just hung up.
[207:15.90]How we doing?
[207:16.22]How you guys doing?
[207:16.78]You guys alright?
[207:17.30]You guys doing alright?
[207:22.45]How you doing?
[207:22.91]How are things?
[207:26.25]You alright?
[207:31.15]My tooth hurts.
[207:32.03]Oh, I'm sorry.
[207:39.47]All of these, like, things tied up to the... Are they, like, tied here?
[207:44.48]Ow.
[207:44.62]Ow.
[208:01.53]Yeah, they like... Yeah, they like chained to these posts.
[208:04.92]Oh.
[208:04.98]Do you have a best Joker impression?
[208:18.15]Dude, no.
[208:19.39]No thanks.
[208:20.03]Not... Alright.
[208:22.23]Maybe another day.
[208:37.24]Damn.
[208:45.23]You go sweepin' with it, alright.
[208:51.15]Can you just be funny again?
[208:59.72]What do you mean again?
[209:01.43]When was I funny?
[209:03.31]Was I funny before?
[209:04.29]What did I do?
[209:04.73]What was the funny thing that I did today?
[209:07.59]Holy shit, this goes all the way down there.
[209:20.01]Oh yeah, I did say I was going to shit my pants on command.
[209:23.87]I don't know, dude.
[209:24.61]What do you want me to say?
[209:27.25]I was upset about stuff.
[209:31.95]Remember, like, getting the nut kick bit?
[209:38.25]I don't remember that.
[209:39.49]I remember talking about, like, FromSoftware's... I don't remember.
[209:42.94]It was like I got kicked in the nuts from FromSoftware's new game.
[209:55.08]Alright, is it this way, that way, or that way?
[210:00.51]This way.
[210:17.17]Raid the blind rage.
[210:18.81]No, I remember I'm I'm I remember talking about I'm kidding No, no way
[210:37.10]Your streams made me want to give Chrome Software Games another chance.
[210:39.06]Now I'm loving them.
[210:39.64]I have Elden Ring, but I'm not touching it until I finish Bloodborne.
[210:44.22]Oh, you are.
[210:44.80]I just have such a treat in front of you.
[210:47.16]Bloodborne?
[210:47.68]You never played it before?
[210:55.24]Oh.
[211:09.87]What the fuck are these iframes?
[211:13.03]Dude, what the heck?
[211:14.77]These fucking halberds.
[211:16.50]The hitbox is a gigantic ice cream cone.
[211:41.47]I can't wait to investigate this.
[211:42.61]Yeah, it really is too bad Bloodborne's not on PC.
[211:56.78]Come on, get out here.
[212:05.92]Leave me alone.
[212:32.58]Oh!
[212:33.52]Another tree!
[212:34.06]Uh, I'll go right.
[212:46.50]If you have spells, use them.
[212:52.46]I-I-I know.
[212:53.40]Don't you think I know that I have a spell?
[212:56.76]Come on!
[212:59.28]I know!
[212:59.92]I know!
[213:08.12]I actually have too many mana blasts if I'm not against Millenia.
[213:16.32]Oh.
[213:20.01]Don't get up, right?
[213:20.71]Oh.
[213:39.22]Okay.
[213:49.62]Ooh.
[213:54.98]Rune?
[213:55.30]Okay, I could go that way eventually, maybe?
[213:58.73]Can I get there from here?
[214:10.40]Oh, shit.
[214:22.55]What are these guys?
[214:30.59]These... What are they?
[214:33.98]Banished knights?
[214:35.74]Hmm.
[214:42.02]I will.
[214:44.43]It's that.
[214:46.85]That.
[214:54.87]What?
[214:56.15]If I two of them?
[214:58.75]Gold skin duo.
[215:00.16]Oh my god, this is going to be fucking awful.
[215:06.24]Doesn't that suck shit up?
[215:16.20]I don't know who I'd rather fight.
[215:25.32]OH!
[215:44.18]Why is the game lagging?
[216:13.34]Well, okay, they're in that room.
[216:18.91]What is the fastest way to get there?
[216:23.79]You gotta fight.
[216:24.21]I can't believe I'm gonna sneeze.
[216:25.23]I just want everyone to be aware.
[216:26.63]I don't think there's anything I can probably do about it.
[216:29.77]I could probably do this.
[216:46.19]Oh, it's right here.
[216:56.44]Excuse me?
[216:57.48]Why can't I go in there?
[216:59.84]What?
[217:00.04]Um... What the fuck?
[217:09.99]I can't go in that door.
[217:13.44]That's the only door that looks like that.
[217:16.02]That I can't... Listen.
[217:18.56]That's a horse shit.
[217:26.79]Really?
[217:27.07]Does this one work?
[217:38.05]Where are they?
[217:53.48]Dude that move is so dumb.
[218:26.52]This lag is killing me here Let me guess you go like get like huge I
[218:52.28]Huh?
[219:05.69]Really?
[219:08.94]Okay.
[219:11.26]Kind of annoying, isn't it?
[219:22.62]This honestly doesn't feel that bad.
[219:24.36]I feel like I'm gonna be okay.
[219:51.34]No!
[219:54.04]Okay, so they've resummoned each other.
[219:56.07]There's a summon outside the door?
[220:08.15]I wonder who it could be.
[220:09.99]I'm gonna fly into outer space.
[220:20.59]Oh, you know what?
[220:21.35]It might be Roger!
[220:24.21]Wait.
[220:29.39]No, it's not.
[220:41.20]Where am I fucking going?
[220:49.17]Kill me.
[220:49.69]I'll start over.
[221:05.26]Okay, it's not there.
[221:06.68]You gotta go around here.
[221:12.69]Okay, honestly, where, stop swinging at me.
[221:17.01]I need to, it's already fucking over.
[221:21.05]Which way is it?
[221:21.65]Is it down this way?
[221:23.40]Is this where it just went?
[221:27.70]It's like all the way down and around, right?
[221:29.38]Yeah, down here.
[221:48.94]That's supposed to suck up sorceries and it doesn't You're already doing the
[222:17.46]I guess they have 50% health.
[222:20.14]Oh fuck, they have both in their second phases.
[222:40.15]DO IT!
[222:46.93]Piece of shit.
[222:47.49]And you're gonna summon your fucking friend again.
[222:49.45]I have no healing potions left!
[223:10.82]What are you, stupid?
[223:11.68]Why would you come in here without them?
[223:12.64]I'm fine.
[223:28.97]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
[223:35.88]What?
[223:38.64]What's going on?
[223:39.26]Okay, are we good?
[223:40.10]Are we good?
[223:41.82]What the fuck happened?
[223:47.33]Black Flame Tornado.
[223:48.39]Cool.
[224:00.13]This boss is the worst boss in the game with a melee build.
[224:02.43]I think Millenia probably is the worst boss in the game with any character.
[224:16.85]Very cool, alright.
[224:19.26]I got a bell, too.
[224:21.14]What was that bell?
[224:25.84]It was not that bad.
[224:27.80]I feel like that could be awful.
[224:32.80]Kind of was.
[224:34.28]Especially, I don't know if it's with other people, too, but this room... I feel like every 10 to 20 seconds lags.
[224:41.82]That makes it even worse.
[224:46.34]That's eight and nine smithing stones.
[224:48.04]Holy shit, really?
[224:51.37]You can get every single weapon in the whole game up to plus nine.
[224:53.81]Alright, that's cool.
[224:56.97]I guess I should just keep going the way that I was going before.
[225:00.51]Straight through here?
[225:05.53]I can go that way or this way?
[225:06.63]I reckon it's cool.
[225:43.60]Mimic is pretty stupid.
[225:44.94]Yeah, I like it.
[225:45.84]Okay.
[225:46.10]A lot of people have been telling me to use the mimic on Malenia.
[225:50.26]No, I'm close enough.
[225:53.14]I think I could do it.
[225:54.82]I need to hunker down and really go for it.
[225:58.68]I probably am not going to do it tonight.
[226:00.06]I've got to be really, really honest with you.
[226:12.13]Um... Back where I was... Wait, is it back where I was?
[226:16.03]Where is this?
[226:21.54]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[226:22.66]Actually, you know what?
[226:23.30]Let me do this while I'm here.
[226:26.73]Mimic makes the game really easy.
[226:28.99]Look, if I need to do the mimic, I'll do it, but I don't think I have to.
[226:33.58]I don't think so.
[226:52.67]Melita's still difficult with the Mimica.
[226:54.14]I would... yeah.
[226:56.88]Do I make the game easy?
[227:03.04]That's not the point.
[227:04.24]Oh, I mean, the point with any video game is to have fun.
[227:08.53]Point.
[227:08.75]That's the whole point.
[227:13.81]However you get enjoyment out of a game you're playing, that's how you should do it.
[227:30.19]You learn that from Molina?
[227:45.40]That's not what I wanted to do.
[227:47.50]Oh my goodness, this is very sloppy.
[227:49.37]Okay, that was... I just got, like, trapped.
[227:55.33]I mean, I got literally trapped.
[228:04.05]It's 130 FP for that Black Knife.
[228:09.07]Do I actually even have that?
[228:14.96]Barely.
[228:15.30]Alright, let's try this again.
[228:17.78]That was kind of annoying.
[228:19.68]OK, let me blink.
[228:27.46]Are you going to the area after Loretta?
[228:29.38]Ooh, I would rewind about an hour or two.
[228:35.20]I would rewind an hour.
[228:36.22]Okay, if you rewind exactly one hour, I'm probably purple.
[228:41.90]And screaming and talking about getting kicked in the balls.
[228:46.53]You have to rewind a little.
[229:07.18]Oh, that's annoying.
[229:08.00]Stop doing that.
[229:10.38]This glare in my eyes, I can't even see where you are.
[229:12.97]So from here...
[229:32.43]That's a boss door.
[229:32.95]I'm imagining I have to go around.
[229:46.43]No. Ooooo. Oooo ooooo ooo.
[230:10.94]Walk into range. I don't we are not gonna do this.
[230:33.85]You're pissing off my cat.
[230:44.74]I'm sorry.
[230:45.16]I didn't.
[230:45.46]That's not my intention.
[230:50.00]This place is probably, I would say, the coolest part of the whole game.
[230:55.22]I think scenery-wise and scale and how cool it looks.
[231:00.54]All the tornadoes.
[231:01.28]This place is awesome.
[231:11.09]Dragons.
[231:11.59]It's like a dragon place.
[231:31.97]Um... Back over here.
[231:39.52]Alright, I can climb this, can I?
[231:43.84]Just not.
[231:44.36]Wait.
[231:53.85]Oh.
[232:02.28]I did that.
[232:21.54]Fall off the edge.
[232:22.24]Yeah!
[232:22.86]Who threw something?
[232:51.27]I don't even remember how to get there.
[232:57.55]It's down here and then around.
[232:59.71]I don't know.
[233:00.57]Whatever.
[233:00.85]I gotta run.
[233:01.33]I'm gonna lose those souls, please.
[233:29.49]make too much noise oh another one
[234:11.39]Jesus!
[234:11.93]That was a good movie death.
[234:20.38]Is that all that was over here?
[234:30.90]Did I really come all the way over here for his lightning grease?
[234:34.54]No, right?
[234:35.18]That's a pain.
[234:40.68]Okay.
[235:01.03]I could jump to there and go that way.
[235:06.09]Let's check and see what's up here though.
[235:07.58]This block.
[235:18.10]Dumbass.
[235:20.92]Are they gonna explode?
[235:25.18]Okay.
[235:26.24]So I can jump from...
[235:29.65]Off-ware.
[235:29.91]Where's this?
[235:46.42]There's just another... Okay, just go this way.
[236:01.00]What's in the Colosseum?
[236:01.72]It's going to be a dragon.
[236:05.59]It's going to be a huge dragon.
[236:09.51]And then we're going to get lore dumped.
[236:10.81]I kind of hope we get lore dumped.
[236:12.57]I want to get lore dumped.
[236:16.21]You see, tarnished in the age of dragons and the Two Fingers.
[236:21.88]Give it to me.
[236:43.05]I want to get lore dumped so bad.
[236:52.50]I am hoping for like a five minute cutscene.
[237:10.38]A Souls game?
[237:11.32]I know.
[237:11.68]It's not gonna happen.
[237:35.84]Any superheroes in chat?
[237:38.86]Um...
[237:42.84]I don't know.
[237:43.18]Do we have any superheroes here?
[237:54.05]Yes, over here.
[237:54.57]Oh, yeah.
[238:04.04]Okay.
[238:04.44]I'm going to keep going down.
[238:15.59]It's gonna kill me.
[238:28.18]Wait, actually you're mad scientist.
[238:31.78]I'm imagining I gotta go like across there?
[238:35.66]There?
[238:42.30]The right?
[238:45.77]Is there where to go up from here?
[239:03.58]Oop.
[239:21.83]Oh my god, that hurts.
[239:22.97]I forgot you have to jump!
[239:43.92]Oh boy, it hurts every moment!
[240:20.91]Where is he?
[240:55.10]Those guys are tricky.
[240:55.98]Is that like an axe?
[241:05.65]Is it like a dragon?
[241:07.05]Oh boy.
[241:21.00]Nice.
[241:21.22]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[241:32.06]You need to go to bed?
[241:32.96]I will.
[241:33.54]Whatever.
[241:33.86]I want to see what this boss is.
[241:53.30]122.
[241:53.80]Shit.
[241:55.90]Well.
[241:56.96]Okay.
[241:59.26]Okay.
[242:42.95]You little shit!
[242:58.31]I hear another one.
[243:06.40]Missed.
[243:42.82]I feel like I can make this jump, but it's definitely a shortcut.
[244:05.91]So, um, I guess we're gonna run.
[244:15.39]Run.
[244:17.27]I'm gonna die.
[244:23.72]Is there safety over here?
[244:24.60]Oh no.
[244:27.84]I didn't fucking see through, did I?
[244:40.98]It shows up on the ground for like a second and then it goes away.
[244:59.50]Oh, shit.
[245:00.14]This bird's all over me.
[245:17.08]Ah, I was looking at my eyes.
[245:28.49]Fuck, just go.
[245:36.49]Can I get on my horse?
[245:53.19]Oh Jesus.
[245:58.09]You're not gonna kill him?
[246:11.41]Dude, I need to be safe for a second here.
[246:18.17]I'm not gonna fight the guy with five eagles surrounding me.
[246:22.81]Where is he?
[246:25.29]Where does he go?
[246:37.95]He leaves.
[246:38.51]He left.
[246:38.85]You're gonna be a pain in the ass.
[246:43.65]I know you are.
[246:53.60]Okay, so he's gone.
[247:09.27]I'm back?
[247:21.77]I don't... I don't know.
[247:27.49]He's not here.
[247:30.88]Okay.
[247:31.86]I'm just gonna keep going.
[247:42.26]He's gonna jump on your head.
[247:43.60]Oh my god, I must walk through this.
[248:09.34]We're getting really close to the tornado.
[248:11.32]I'm almost out of mana.
[248:22.61]Missed the item behind the dragon.
[248:28.98]Shit, there is an item.
[248:32.18]Have you seen a tornado in real life?
[248:42.23]I have not.
[248:46.59]I'm equally terrified and fascinated.
[248:48.21]Here we go.
[248:50.49]Thank you.
[248:51.91]Yeah, I'm equally horrified and fascinated by a tornado.
[249:05.75]So what's up here?
[249:06.87]Oh fuck.
[249:07.71]I gotta two-hand this now.
[249:41.24]I feel like I have 30 smithing stones left.
[249:43.78]Where's that guy gone?
[249:58.93]What are you doing?
[249:59.75]Why are you getting into position?
[250:06.73]Ugh.
[250:46.81]Why is he standing there like that?
[251:09.12]Get up.
[251:09.52]Get up.
[251:14.78]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[251:18.20]You're gonna fucking fool me.
[251:21.86]Why am I going back to this thing?
[251:47.97]That's it, right?
[251:49.25]Just you two?
[251:49.91]There's another one in here.
[251:52.34]Yes, there is.
[251:53.74]Sneaky little shit.
[252:08.28]Another Bell Baron.
[252:17.50]Did I even get the Grace?
[252:18.28]What?
[252:20.90]What?
[252:21.16]What's going on?
[252:25.75]What?
[252:36.14]Grace up at the lift.
[252:37.48]Yeah.
[252:38.14]I mean, I'm just going, man.
[252:52.45]I'm going.
[252:55.13]I'm right here.
[253:02.38]I don't want to die.
[253:11.23]Go back after the Grace.
[253:12.29]Let me level up.
[253:15.63]Alright.
[253:18.71]It's time to start putting points in endurance.
[253:21.75]I think.
[253:25.91]Or should I get to 60 bigger?
[253:32.62]I think it's endurance.
[253:34.86]That's so low.
[253:36.90]Okay, so I'm here.
[253:43.08]Are you saying that there is a... Oh, back here, there's a secret area.
[253:56.24]Somebody said shut up chat get a hobby Get a hobby Um this dragon has no health
[254:25.40]Can I get there quickly from somewhere?
[254:31.17]Have I even been down there?
[254:33.03]Yeah, right?
[254:33.61]Isn't that the guy that was throwing lightning at me?
[254:37.44]Yeah, it is.
[254:43.76]What's going on here?
[254:46.07]Use your hat as a glider.
[254:47.37]Just go down the stairs.
[254:56.47]Yeah.
[254:56.87]I guess I could just run.
[255:09.58]Could have been a lot more nerve-wracking, but I feel like it may have been.
[255:20.54]Up.
[255:20.70]Up already.
[255:22.70]Up!
[255:34.00]Okay, so this dragon has no health.
[255:37.93]Yeah, I've got a feeling you're going to kill me in the ass, aren't you?
[255:44.01]Okay.
[255:46.31]Um, let's go.
[255:49.85]Why is his health so low?
[255:51.55]His health is dead.
[256:09.79]Okay.
[256:10.43]That was cool.
[256:11.79]Why was his health so low?
[256:15.87]That's not what we were talking about.
[256:20.07]By the trees where the guy got into position.
[256:26.52]And over here?
[256:44.53]You mean down here?
[256:48.42]By the trees?
[256:49.26]The guy got in position over here.
[256:52.94]Am I going to die if I do that?
[256:58.81]I feel like I'm going to die.
[257:02.95]Am I dead if I do this?
[257:23.46]Okay.
[257:24.68]Well, I thought it was there.
[257:27.40]Press the button.
[257:28.02]At least it's going to be there when I get back.
[257:38.89]Okay.
[257:46.08]So we're around still.
[257:49.70]I'm there.
[258:03.74]I'm going to have to go past the two guys and look down to the right.
[258:14.41]Can you fucking leave me alone?
[258:19.37]It's right here, isn't it?
[258:21.01]What's that?
[258:22.47]That's not it.
[258:27.77]Why did he jump?
[258:28.75]I was already gone.
[258:34.15]I mean, I went into the tornado.
[258:36.43]You don't have to come follow me.
[258:43.97]Straight out and then look down.
[258:45.61]Okay.
[258:49.45]It's so funny whenever they see that.
[258:52.14]The AI in FromSoftware games is so funny.
[258:54.86]And the reason why they're so interesting, and the reason why these games are so fun, is because the AI in these games has one thing that it does.
[259:03.84]It has one task.
[259:05.08]There's no dialog.
[259:06.28]There's no, oh, stranger!
[259:08.06]Get him!
[259:08.76]No, no, no.
[259:09.72]Their AI is just fucking kill that as fast as possible.
[259:14.42]No matter what.
[259:15.28]Under any circumstance.
[259:17.54]They don't do anything else.
[259:19.92]They just kill as much and as fast as possible.
[259:25.60]They'll even hit each other.
[259:26.58]They'll kill each other.
[259:27.22]They don't even care.
[259:29.90]I think that makes them even more terrifying.
[259:32.62]So many games do the AI where it's like, they'll talk to you.
[259:37.31]They'll stop.
[259:38.25]They'll pause for a second.
[259:40.53]They'll have something to say.
[259:41.63]They'll have something that they do.
[259:42.83]They'll fall down.
[259:44.13]They'll drop something.
[259:47.36]It's just one thing is programmed into these enemies.
[259:50.78]KILL!
[259:52.56]It's so funny when they both have the kill program and... Okay.
[260:02.45]When you have like two or three enemies that have the kill program and they just start beating the absolute shit out of each other.
[260:07.97]It's so funny.
[260:10.99]That makes them so much more terrifying.
[260:13.68]Especially the knights.
[260:14.58]Especially the characters that you would expect to be able to talk to you or say something or act any differently.
[260:20.41]No.
[260:25.19]Nothing.
[260:25.81]No talking.
[260:27.89]No expressions.
[260:30.58]They're just trying to kill you as hard as possible.
[260:44.04]Now, Bloodborne enemies did talk, but I don't think it took away from the experience.
[260:48.84]You know, like, away!
[260:50.18]Away!
[260:50.72]Oh, you foul beast!
[261:07.03]Am I going the right way?
[261:14.97]You are not wanted here.
[261:18.95]And they do like the huge scream.
[261:32.31]What do I do?
[261:46.87]You have to jump.
[261:47.73]Into the tornado?
[261:48.69]Where?
[261:49.89]Just lie down.
[262:19.26]Look, look.
[262:20.70]I don't get it.
[262:22.97]Dirt patch?
[262:27.29]What?
[263:05.97]Going backwards?
[263:06.87]Hey.
[264:20.33]No horse allowed.
[264:22.89]Interesting.
[264:30.86]This is a huge area.
[264:32.04]No horse?
[264:39.65]I mean, you're coming with me.
[264:43.09]Malenia was fucking messed up, man.
[264:45.47]It was so hard.
[264:47.63]I think we got this one together.
[264:50.15]You and me?
[264:51.99]Yeah, you and me.
[264:52.63]That's a bad voice for that character.
[264:54.45]Dragonlord Placidusax.
[265:03.79]Red lightning.
[265:04.83]Placidusax.
[265:14.54]I'm just trying to keep my eye on the ground.
[265:31.63]Yikes.
[265:33.23]Right down?
[265:33.63]Does it come up?
[265:34.19]What happens?
[265:36.27]Okay, that is quite the move.
[265:40.31]Gotta be aware of that.
[265:57.38]He's got two heads.
[265:58.78]Whoa!
[266:00.79]Whoa!
[266:18.41]Don't get greedy.
[266:18.89]Don't get greedy.
[266:19.47]There's no reason to.
[266:28.20]That fills his whole body.
[266:47.21]Oh my god!
[266:51.26]What the bug?!
[266:52.70]Oh, it's like that bug boss, it disappears and it's scary.
[266:56.94]Just gotta get out of this thing.
[267:07.45]I wonder if there's a place where you don't get hurt in a battle.
[267:37.59]Oh my god!
[267:38.69]No!
[267:42.23]I'm terrified.
[268:06.06]Where's he?
[268:11.22]Oh my god, that was fucking majestic.
[268:13.44]I have time?
[268:20.41]Oh, kind of, but not really.
[268:21.51]That was stupid.
[268:28.08]Oh my god.
[268:52.82]Almost out of mana.
[268:53.44]It's gonna get ugly.
[269:00.98]Fuck it, do it again.
[269:27.84]That was crazy.
[269:28.44]I thought he was done with the attack.
[269:40.05]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[269:44.89]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[269:46.76]One, two, three, four, five, six A.
[269:49.36]searching around in your fucking huge ass backpack why did I do that because I had no oh my fucking god put it in the pouch that's really gonna do that because I had like this much health and I didn't want to die in one hit
[270:18.24]I get it.
[270:18.54]That was fun.
[270:18.96]That was a cool fight.
[270:21.64]What else do I want to put on here?
[270:27.31]I'll take a rune arc.
[270:29.42]Once I get down there.
[270:51.94]Okay.
[271:31.95]Does he hate the game?
[271:32.73]What?
[271:33.01]No.
[271:33.23]I think it's amazing.
[271:39.66]Where's the nerd here?
[271:45.34]That fight's really cool.
[271:47.36]I'm looking forward to doing it again.
[271:49.18]I wish there was a statue down here.
[271:50.30]I don't have to do this every single time.
[272:03.64]I'll take a rune arc.
[272:04.32]Why not?
[272:08.97]Yeah, why not?
[272:13.91]It's good.
[272:19.69]Okay.
[272:20.51]And let's go.
[272:23.69]Elden Ring is objectively a mediocre game.
[272:27.18]I'm going to have to disagree with you a little.
[272:39.77]I'm not going for- I'm not doing any moon shit.
[272:42.23]No moons.
[272:44.27]That's way too fancy right now.
[272:45.57]Just kill it.
[272:47.77]Go.
[273:10.07]Oh, fuck.
[273:11.21]My fingers are getting, like, really sore and slippery.
[273:14.69]That's a sign.
[273:15.31]That's a bad sign.
[273:27.71]Really?
[273:28.95]I thought I dodged that.
[273:39.80]What's the edge?
[273:41.82]You know what?
[273:42.28]Oh my god, what am I thinking?
[273:44.74]That's a perfect time to do this a couple times.
[274:02.11]There he goes in this.
[274:02.89]He's going to do this bullshit.
[274:03.85]Yep.
[274:22.88]Oh, he does a little, a little hop.
[274:24.04]He does a little like, oh shit.
[274:28.87]He does like a little...
[274:36.59]I gotta get the fuck out of this!
[274:44.74]This is a really awful, sloppy fucking run.
[274:46.76]This is the worst run I've done all night.
[274:49.06]On any bus.
[274:53.24]This is what happens when you play for eight and a half hours.
[274:58.99]That's the wash.
[274:59.53]Come on, come on.
[274:59.87]Come on, so I can fucking take this.
[275:21.25]Oh, come on.
[275:24.57]What?
[275:24.79]That hit me?
[275:25.45]How?
[275:25.73]What the fuck are you talking about?
[276:00.81]Oh my god Missed him
[276:33.39]Where is he?
[276:42.24]Oh my god, he's behind me.
[276:44.54]Oh, shit.
[276:53.57]Moon?
[276:54.81]I did like five moons to him.
[277:03.29]You gotta rush him.
[277:04.29]The last bit's rough.
[277:05.57]I was really, really sloppy on the first phase there.
[277:11.68]I was just like, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.
[277:15.28]That was awful.
[277:35.78]Nebula will be really good.
[277:37.00]Actually, that's a really good idea.
[277:41.13]I'll try Nebula.
[277:59.76]Moon isn't good to spam.
[278:00.58]Use it for the debuff.
[278:03.89]Does the moon make anybody take more magic damage or is it only cold sorcery damage?
[278:18.39]Only frost.
[278:24.96]I'm going to do... Let's just go in there and just Nebula.
[278:28.54]Let's do Nebula.
[278:29.08]Let's just get in there.
[278:29.73]Just get... Let's get in there.
[278:30.93]Watch this.
[278:31.29]I'm just going to get in there and Nebula.
[278:33.15]Let's get in there.
[278:36.17]Yeah, it's Nebula time.
[278:39.89]Fucking... Let's go.
[278:40.55]I want to cast this for free.
[278:48.15]Let's go.
[278:48.71]Probably could have got a little closer, but whatever.
[278:51.15]Nebula.
[278:51.47]Let's go.
[278:51.81]Nebula.
[278:52.63]Nebula.
[278:57.34]I'm not... I don't even care about these souls.
[279:01.28]Check this out.
[279:01.76]Alright, that was... Alright, the first part of this fight, he just puts that shit everywhere.
[279:22.83]And this is what happened to me last time.
[279:24.43]I'll be a couple more.
[279:36.14]I can't tell if it's better.
[279:41.26]Hard to tell.
[279:46.02]Am I doing more damage?
[279:47.16]I think it takes a little longer.
[279:48.16]I don't think so.
[279:49.78]Cold is better.
[280:04.13]Gonna do that move where he spams the ground with that bullshit.
[280:06.99]Where is it?
[280:07.87]Come on, just do it.
[280:08.65]I know you can do it.
[280:17.41]Right, the one fucking second that I... Annoying little shit.
[280:23.50]Stop it!
[280:31.50]Oh my god, he's scared the fuck out of me, dude.
[280:50.40]Alright, can you fucking stop doing that?
[280:59.23]Stop!
[281:00.17]Stay!
[281:02.87]Why is he not staying?
[281:03.95]Am I still in it?
[281:32.77]God dammit!
[281:41.99]Oh my god.
[281:46.99]I'm dead.
[281:53.99]Why is always fucking right on me? You have to be right on me every goddamn time?
[282:00.02]This is one of these assholes that, like, if you get close, you just have to fucking, you just have to run. Just run away from the fight.
[282:09.68]Just don't get close to him.
[282:10.28]Don't stay far away.
[282:10.88]Don't get close to him.
[282:11.50]Don't get far away.
[282:12.04]Don't get close to him.
[282:12.74]Are you stupid?
[282:41.40]God damn it!
[282:45.98]Where is he?
[282:48.30]You?
[282:56.76]What the fuck do I do about that move?
[282:59.36]Oh fucking Jesus!
[283:01.26]What are you doing, man?
[283:04.90]You done?
[283:18.73]Keep getting him down at this part.
[283:30.57]They had to put another one of these assholes in the game that just, like, fucking appears behind you somewhere.
[283:37.92]So, when he starts doing that movie, he's gonna run out.
[283:44.46]Okay, the actual first thing is first.
[283:47.14]Do not, under any, any fucking circumstance, do not go near the boss in the first minute.
[283:55.79]He just puts the red stuff on the ground and you're gonna get hit by it and you're gonna drink four flasks because you get stuck in there.
[284:02.08]Do you understand?
[284:18.60]So you're literally just bad.
[284:21.24]You're literally getting banned for five days.
[284:25.34]Got him!
[284:34.70]I'm probably streaming in five days.
[284:38.83]By the way, five days is about five minutes.
[284:52.44]They brought this gimmick back.
[284:53.80]It's just like, boss disappears.
[284:57.00]And you fucking... Found him!
[285:05.61]I'm not gonna take a rune arc.
[285:06.45]I don't think it's a waste.
[285:29.13]See?
[285:29.81]He does this stupid shit, and I keep getting hit by it.
[285:32.17]I'm not getting hit by it anymore.
[285:33.33]Check it out.
[285:37.95]It's the same two stupid-ass fucking moves from the beginning.
[285:42.10]Just wait till this asshole is done with his stupid... Spam the whole fucking room, and now let's play the game.
[286:00.48]Let's go.
[286:28.30]He's getting his ass kicked.
[286:30.84]Ambo's getting destroyed.
[286:36.20]Here we go.
[286:40.42]He's trying to run away.
[286:41.34]He's like, oh shit!
[286:50.13]Am I too far away?
[286:50.87]What?
[286:50.99]No, I'm not.
[286:52.83]Okay.
[287:01.26]Here we go.
[287:18.03]Fuck you!
[287:35.80]Done?
[287:48.91]No!
[287:51.21]No!
[288:21.69]Jesus!
[288:22.31]Oh, that little fucking crow hop is so stupid!
[288:59.38]Fuck you!
[288:59.76]Where is he?
[289:08.24]Oh shit.
[289:21.21]Dude.
[289:24.57]Come on!
[289:25.67]What the fuck?
[289:29.57]Oh, you pain in the ass!
[289:30.92]I already knew!
[289:54.19]Dude!
[289:56.77]Where?
[289:57.29]Where?
[290:01.87]No!
[290:02.57]That was quick!
[290:03.68]That was quick!
[290:04.82]Bro, that was quick!
[290:08.16]Bro, that was quick!
[290:20.51]You killed a pain in the ass!
[290:21.95]I think that was fun.
[290:29.59]Remembrance of the Dragonlord.
[290:43.25]That's a lot.
[290:44.89]Mogs was the most in the whole game so far.
[290:48.13]280... Mogs was 420,000.
[290:48.85]I mean, that was a really cool fight.
[290:55.68]It was.
[290:57.04]You know, the teleport shit.
[290:58.32]You know.
[290:59.34]That was probably one of the cooler fights in the game.
[291:03.80]Just in regards to bosses.
[291:05.94]How interesting that was.
[291:07.44]So this is... I have so many fucking items in my inventory.
[291:14.19]Where is it?
[291:16.99]Is that not a... Is it just a spell?
[291:23.73]Isn't it a remembrance?
[291:28.57]Where is it?
[291:32.50]Oh, it's a weird looking.
[291:35.64]Remembrance of Dragonlord Placidusax.
[291:37.86]He went into the Erdtree.
[291:40.23]The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader, yeah.
[291:43.48]The dragon lord whose seat lies at the heart of the storm beyond time is said to have been Elden Lord in the age before the Erdtree.
[291:52.88]Once his god was fled, the lord continued to await its return.
[291:58.74]This dragon was the Elden Lord?
[292:03.61]The original Elden Lord.
[292:04.83]Huh.
[292:14.61]That's pretty cool 25 endurance is probably what I'm going for here Anybody have anything to say about that?
[292:38.11]Anybody have anything to say?
[292:40.87]You're still gone.
[292:43.17]Oh, what's that?
[292:43.51]What is it?
[292:43.87]What's the item?
[292:44.23]Dragon King's Crag Blade.
[292:49.02]Oh.
[293:05.62]and 36 faith golden breath of the dragon lord transforms the caster into the dragon lord to spew golden breath these are the dying whales of the dragon lord who once dwelled eternally beyond time that seems pretty good these are both awesome this is just a pure dex weapon
[293:36.33]That's pretty cool.
[293:38.23]How much longer?
[293:40.15]I'm going to see what the boss is up there.
[293:43.93]And then... I'll probably end it there.
[293:48.35]I don't think we're going to beat it.
[293:52.13]Well, I'm going to break it.
[293:56.16]I'm going to smash it.
[293:57.34]Because I... That's not for this character.
[294:00.62]Maybe...
[294:04.29]Oh yeah, Holly is doing dragon stuff, so... Let me get that.
[294:14.85]Gonna be cool.
[294:16.81]Next boss is one of the best in the game.
[294:20.75]I think that one was pretty cool.
[294:23.33]I would put that up there.
[294:24.83]30,000 souls is really nothing.
[294:30.79]Let's... I want to keep going over there.
[294:35.65]This area, I think, is my favorite area of the game.
[294:40.15]I think it's just really, really cool looking.
[294:43.41]This place is beyond time.
[294:47.83]What?
[294:47.99]This place is... I don't get it.
[294:54.49]Wrong place.
[294:55.15]Yes, it is.
[294:58.41]Where's the right place?
[295:05.06]Yeah, everything went backwards.
[295:08.40]Not right either.
[295:08.98]Which is the... This isn't where I fought him.
[295:12.34]Dragon Temple.
[295:14.46]What's the right one?
[295:17.16]Isn't it Dragon Temple?
[295:19.41]By the bridge, bud.
[295:26.77]There we go, okay.
[295:31.67]So this thing, like, is rewinding time?
[295:36.40]Or it did when I laid down.
[295:37.96]Why did it do that when I laid down?
[295:44.24]Go down there.
[295:50.81]Storm at the center is beyond time.
[295:56.91]Well.
[295:58.93]No time like the present.
[296:04.97]Tree Sentinel?
[296:14.69]It is.
[296:25.21]You're like a... You're like a waffle for a second.
[296:27.71]You're different than the others.
[296:48.10]Fuck, he's one of these guys.
[297:29.07]I had to eat that and I would have died if I didn't.
[298:09.68]You've got to be fucking kidding me!
[298:30.63]Whoa, Malformed Dragon Helm.
[298:33.39]Malformed Dragon Armor.
[298:42.58]Let me take a look at that.
[298:43.46]Holy shit.
[298:46.64]It's not even that heavy.
[298:47.36]Is that better than what I have on?
[298:51.23]Kind of is.
[299:15.06]Still medium.
[299:22.24]Still medium, yeah.
[299:26.89]Yeah.
[299:29.03]Oh, wow.
[299:29.43]Cool.
[299:29.65]I look pretty cool.
[299:34.79]I don't want to lose 100,000 souls, so we're going to... I'm just going to go this way for a minute.
[299:49.26]There's another way to go over here.
[299:58.24]I need like another 20,000.
[299:58.78]Is there anything else that I missed?
[300:08.83]Probably, but... That dragon wasn't even the boss, like the actual boss of this area.
[300:18.69]Is there anybody who can just fight right here?
[300:21.83]Oh my god, thank god I jumped.
[300:23.13]I just need to kill a few.
[300:44.96]Seven.
[300:51.34]Uh... I got a better idea.
[301:21.92]Stop looking.
[301:22.50]Stop looking at it.
[301:23.18]Like it's a broken toy.
[301:24.94]Auto.
[301:29.73]It's not funny.
[301:31.85]They go like, what's happening here?
[301:34.07]I don't understand.
[301:35.03]Why is it so confusing?
[301:49.33]Almost there.
[301:49.81]130?
[301:49.83]120?
[301:49.85]We'll do Endurance again.
[301:51.07]Oh, I thought you were dead.
[301:55.11]128.
[301:56.53]Almost there.
[302:13.93]25.
[302:13.95]127.
[302:14.21]Almost.
[302:14.51]Get them all.
[302:17.55]Okay, we're good.
[302:18.15]Bye.
[302:48.08]base of the tree before uh Malenia is a better spot get Otto to fight Malenia game crash please don't tell me you crashed I think it did did I go too fast was I going too fast
[303:28.80]Oh, but still there.
[303:29.94]You went too furious?
[303:34.69]I think I'm fine.
[303:39.45]I just want to see what's in there, and then that'll be it.
[303:44.11]Bricked?
[303:44.69]I don't think I bricked the save.
[303:52.39]Get some rest?
[303:54.51]Yeah, I'll be alright.
[303:55.07]I'm fine.
[303:55.43]I'll be alright.
[303:59.37]It's definitely fine.
[304:06.59]When will you play something else?
[304:10.18]When I'm done with this.
[304:11.66]Which I'm getting painfully close to the end of the game.
[304:14.30]Painfully.
[304:14.76]Alright, there we go.
[304:31.96]Alright, this time, let's do it slowly.
[304:34.24]I'm not going to do it like... Okay, ready?
[304:35.30]Okay.
[304:39.30]Endurance up.
[304:54.47]Now let's see what is behind this door.
[304:59.90]Very curious of what's up here because this area is already sort of interesting.
[305:05.56]I want to know what is in here.
[305:10.12]Who is behind this whole thing?
[305:12.56]Why?
[305:13.86]And what are the fingers?
[305:16.60]Why are they here?
[305:18.06]Why won't it talk to me anymore?
[305:19.00]I want to answer that.
[305:27.09]Alright.
[305:27.83]So what...
[305:29.32]He's here.
[305:32.34]Oh, that's a loading screen.
[305:34.64]Thou who approacheth Destined Death.
[305:39.86]Wait.
[305:40.10]I will not have it stopped for me again.
[305:46.82]It's him?
[305:53.13]What is he doing here?
[306:05.41]That's, um, Gurranq , right?
[306:06.77]I don't know what Gurranq  is doing here.
[306:13.85]Is it a different guy?
[306:14.71]Didn't finish the questline.
[306:19.83]No, I didn't.
[306:22.75]It's a different beast clergyman.
[306:26.81]Alright, well, okay, don't roll to the left.
[306:32.54]Noted.
[306:44.95]I can't believe it.
[306:46.46]I didn't, I don't know.
[306:51.86]I swear to God.
[307:06.64]I said it and immediately forgot it.
[307:14.28]you will not take Destined Death from me alright dick
[307:40.94]Okay, get away from the light.
[307:52.93]He's throwing drops!
[308:00.60]He's fast.
[308:04.08]It's greedy, no reason to be greedy.
[308:05.89]Gotta wait a little longer for that one.
[308:18.70]Jump over that.
[308:19.32]Absolutely.
[308:30.74]Jeez, man.
[308:42.98]Come on, fucking go!
[308:43.85]Stop!
[308:46.37]Jump!
[308:50.67]That's what you do!
[308:51.49]Come on, fuck you!
[308:58.44]I'm just gonna do this!
[308:59.06]Come on!
[309:11.14]Don't say it, you fucking stupid bitch.
[309:21.46]Guess who?
[309:50.86]What's wrong with his hand?
[309:55.01]Oh, death.
[309:59.06]Become my blade once more.
[310:22.06]We're gonna see what they look like.
[310:27.50]Oh, he's one of those, like, wolf-lion people.
[310:35.11]That weapon is insane looking.
[310:53.78]Maliketh the Black Blade.
[310:58.81]That's two.
[311:02.77]Maliketh!
[311:03.13]I feel like I'm... He swam.
[311:44.28]Huh.
[311:48.95]Give a debuff?
[311:49.77]I'll just sit at the bonfire.
[311:58.03]Fixed.
[312:01.54]The ability is bleeding you.
[312:08.35]That's a cool fight.
[312:10.99]Low health, but high damage.
[312:12.01]You just kind of got to get in there, huh?
[312:13.97]I wonder if I should just... What a tell.
[312:22.46]Reduces your max HP.
[312:29.76]Alright, well, let's go.
[312:31.02]Just don't get hit.
[312:48.46]I can't dodge.
[312:49.61]I'm fucked.
[312:50.53]Yeah, I'm dead.
[312:51.05]Just kill me.
[312:51.65]Like, dude, what was I thinking?
[312:53.19]He comes in so fast.
[313:01.65]Thank you.
[313:32.38]Don't panic.
[313:37.15]Fuck you, game.
[313:39.47]Good luck.
[313:53.11]Alright, let's go.
[314:00.47]That's not gonna work here.
[314:10.20]Comes up, then down!
[314:12.78]Jesus!
[314:13.54]Okay.
[314:16.28]Goes up, and then down, and then up, and then down, and does like the g-g-g-g-g-g.
[314:26.61]Alright.
[314:27.05]Put the... Put the fucking... This stupid moon blade away.
[314:31.66]This is just gonna get me killed.
[314:32.96]There's no reason.
[314:33.44]I don't even want it on the bar.
[314:35.26]Let's get rid of it.
[314:38.72]These are gonna get me killed.
[314:39.70]I need to think.
[314:41.68]What else?
[314:42.02]What do I have that's quick?
[314:50.89]Comet?
[314:51.31]No.
[314:54.29]I don't know.
[315:05.68]magic glint blade.
[315:06.62]I don't think any of these are going to do anything for me.
[315:11.32]I think I have to try this.
[315:15.09]This might be interesting.
[315:21.57]Just in case.
[315:22.87]I'll keep the moon.
[315:24.13]Let me try this.
[315:25.55]I wonder how this works.
[315:32.74]Five more minutes and then I'm going to go.
[315:36.08]I did not anticipate this being a 9 hour stream.
[315:41.16]Bounding rain of stars is not quick.
[315:42.64]I'm curious if I can get it off before he comes over to me.
[315:53.01]Baby rattle is an accessory at this point.
[315:54.95]I mean at this point I have the plus 10 wound sorcery thing.
[316:11.45]I feel like if he got hit by that it would be way better.
[316:14.71]Did you do it to the pillar or throw?
[316:25.76]I'm curious if it'll...
[316:34.64]It's okay.
[316:35.24]I wouldn't say it's great.
[316:37.00]Okay.
[317:03.16]Those were some legs.
[317:49.35]Fuck.
[317:50.65]Get a lot of grain.
[317:56.31]Jesus Christ!
[317:58.83]Oh my God!
[318:01.95]What the fuck was that shit?
[318:18.10]We have two minutes left.
[318:26.12]Now, also, like, the only thing FromSoftware at this point to just have, like, a line in the middle of the health bar.
[318:34.87]Like, the, like, phase two, here comes phase two.
[318:38.65]Just put a line in the middle.
[318:41.47]Just put a line in the middle.
[318:44.71]Like, we know it's there.
[318:46.81]We know it's there.
[319:11.07]Like, I don't know how many more, like... Hey, look, uh, debates.
[319:30.22]That counts?
[319:30.84]Ah, fine.
[319:36.80]If that motherfucker goes down and starts talking and being like, death is my... I am going to keep spamming spells at him.
[319:43.25]I'm not going to let him keep talking.
[319:45.57]I'm going to go up there and whack him in the fucking head over and over again.
[319:49.57]Why would I let him talk?
[320:12.79]What?
[320:13.69]What?
[320:59.20]Shit What's going on?
[321:07.13]Why is he stuck?
[321:18.19]God dammit!
[321:53.58]What the fuck?
[321:54.76]What?
[321:57.00]I couldn't do anything.
[321:58.24]I couldn't even, I couldn't attack him.
[322:02.02]He was just never ending.
[322:03.50]Never fucking ending.
[322:05.30]Oh my god, that's so frustrating.
[322:09.26]That was a cringe ass guy behind the pillar.
[322:31.00]Oh, that's so fucking frustrating.
[322:38.02]I know, attack him.
[322:38.98]But like, dude, when the guy is like just spinning and fucking flipping and like, like fucking fanning these blood.
[322:46.97]What?
[322:47.43]I've only seen it two times.
[322:54.71]Fucker.
[322:55.35]He was dead.
[323:01.31]This is literally the fucking second time I've seen that move.
[323:17.09]There's a fucking killer behind me.
[323:27.19]I swear to God, man.
[323:28.19]Fuck this room.
[323:52.64]Thank you.
[324:02.62]Gotta be ready for phase two.
[324:44.85]Oh my god, you motherfucker.
[324:46.88]Like you've got to be kidding me.
[324:48.28]Is it going through his fucking stupid ass fucking cloak?
[325:03.23]so so
[325:34.40]Oh yeah, gotta stay try to stay on his legs or something.
[325:42.73]Uh, he almost fucking had it too.
[325:44.35]What a piece of shit.
[325:49.67]What a piece of shit.
[325:52.44]I just, like, that time when he had, like, one hit left, it was just like, dude, I didn't know what he was gonna fucking do.
[325:58.96]The guy flips around like a fucking maniac.
[326:16.56]That blocks him, right?
[327:18.63]What the fuck does he do here?
[327:42.18]Stop dodging!
[327:42.86]The input happened and I didn't do it!
[328:05.46]This game sucks There's a cutscene, what is it?
[328:27.41]I'm kidding, this is one of the best games to come out in the last decade.
[328:29.25]I'm kidding.
[328:35.12]Is this the third phase?
[328:36.14]No, I got the Resembrance.
[328:38.56]What words am I saying?
[329:08.87]The rune of death is unbound.
[329:19.90]And the Lands Between are shrouded by death's dark fate.
[329:29.74]But the flames will also burn the impenetrable thorns.
[329:43.62]What did you do?
[329:44.43]Um... I burnt the whole world to the ground.
[329:52.05]He looks depressed.
[329:53.01]I'm just tired.
[330:13.09]I'm just tired, man.
[330:14.69]I'm cranky, and I'm hungry, and I'm tired, and I'm stupid.
[330:17.65]What happened here?
[330:45.27]Lyndell Ashen Capital.
[330:51.07]Whoa.
[330:54.94]Cool.
[331:15.80]Cool.
[331:15.94]Can I still go to the... Can I go to the round table?
[331:27.38]New items can be purchased from the Twin Maidens.
[331:32.64]This place is in the Erdtree.
[331:36.60]Will you wake up already?
[331:37.77]Oh.
[331:51.68]This is a fate sword.
[331:52.46]Maliketh's black blade, which once harbored the power of the rune of death, a sad shadow of its former glory.
[332:02.34]After a fragment of death was stolen on that fateful night, Maliketh bound the blade within his own flesh, such that none might ever rob death again.
[332:12.37]that free the remnants of Destined Death plunging the greatsword into the ground to summon a myriad of blades.
[332:22.34]In addition to dealing immediate damage, this attack reduces the enemy's maximum HP.
[332:30.36]Oh, what about this?
[332:32.76]Man, Faith gets all the cool shit at the end of the game.
[332:35.16]Blackblade's spinning slash that emits wave of light. 46.
[332:44.07]It's an illusory black blade then leaps forward to deliver a spinning slash that emits a new, a wave of light.
[332:49.99]Followed up with one additional attack.
[332:53.01]This blade was once imbued with Destined Death.
[332:55.35]In addition to dealing damage, it reduces its foe's max HP.
[332:59.35]Remembrance of the black blade.
[333:07.37]You didn't get the coolest int spell?
[333:09.53]So wait, why are the Two Fingers still doing this?
[333:17.20]Why, where's the guidance?
[333:18.30]Where's the help?
[333:22.38]Oh, Maliketh's helm.
[333:27.42]Queen Merika's loyal half-brother wore a blade imbued with Destined Death, and there was not one demigod who did not fear him.
[333:36.03]Champions knew what was at stake.
[333:37.65]Indeed, that is what made them champions.
[333:40.43]So, let me get this straight.
[333:43.58]Is this guy who's got Destined Death
[333:48.41]That... People are fra... Is what?
[333:51.55]You can't come back or something?
[333:56.90]Like, if you... If Maliketh killed you... Would you just... Would you, like, dead permanently or something?
[334:04.26]I don't get it.
[334:04.72]Destined Death.
[334:05.40]You die for real.
[334:08.92]Everyone's immortal.
[334:09.82]But if this guy killed you, you're dead.
[334:12.70]You don't come back.
[334:13.18]Cool.
[334:19.10]How much better is this?
[334:19.80]It's alright.
[334:25.39]Very cool.
[334:27.39]I'm going to crush it because I am a sorcery person.
[334:32.77]Okay.
[334:41.38]Who's left here?
[334:45.26]I see.
[334:46.50]You're here for some spirit, June.
[334:50.15]Really?
[334:55.09]You still here?
[334:55.63]Who are you?
[335:01.85]I must be a blacksmith.
[335:06.25]Now, let's get smithing.
[335:10.23]Who are you?
[335:10.67]Tell me about yourself.
[335:14.63]Could you tell me what happened?
[335:17.29]Why is the round table burning?
[335:25.57]Why does that girl weep for me?
[335:27.77]What happened?
[335:32.12]Have I forgotten something of dire importance?
[335:41.73]Who you are now.
[335:50.81]What does Gideon say now?
[335:53.09]Is he still just here?
[336:02.48]Where did he leave?
[336:09.91]Nope.
[336:11.01]Gone.
[336:19.87]Remember that.
[336:23.61]Okay, I got a lot of these bell bearings.
[336:31.32]That's crazy.
[336:34.11]Cracked crystal.
[336:35.33]What else is new here?
[336:40.01]Ease.
[336:40.23]Protection.
[336:41.83]Divine fortification.
[336:46.36]Amph.
[336:50.28]Talk to the girl again.
[337:03.73]I don't know why it's making me laugh, but when I said, this game sucks, somebody just went, no, it doesn't.
[337:09.18]It just hit me right now.
[337:10.18]That was funny.
[337:11.52]I see.
[337:12.81]Okay, yeah, what happened to Hugh?
[337:16.67]Why is- what's wrong?
[337:41.25]I'll remain with Hugh.
[337:42.95]He made me who I am today.
[337:45.08]I'd like to return the kindness in whatever small way I can.
[337:52.10]Please, become Elden Lord.
[337:56.14]Hugh was always saying that you were a lord to him.
[338:01.46]So slay her with the weapons he smithed.
[338:05.71]Slay the god Marika, who cursed us all.
[338:16.73]I thought that Marika was... Queen Marika was the...
[338:24.06]Let me curse.
[338:29.07]Is Marika evil?
[338:30.71]Okay.
[338:36.47]I'm curious.
[338:36.95]I'm not going to bed yet.
[338:41.53]I'm curious.
[338:42.53]I just want to know.
[338:44.30]I want to know.
[338:44.82]I'm not going to bed.
[338:45.38]Not yet.
[338:46.32]I'm not going to fight any bosses.
[338:47.60]I just want to see what's going on.
[338:49.24]I want to see something.
[338:51.50]Let's see.
[338:53.49]I'm not doing anything.
[338:54.79]I'm not going to end the game.
[338:56.15]I just want to see.
[338:58.25]Because I'm not sitting at a cliffhanger until I stream next.
[339:02.32]I'll talk to Hugh.
[339:06.78]Look, if I walk in the door and I get killed by the boss, I'm not going to fight the boss, right?
[339:12.18]I just need to see.
[339:12.72]Alright, let's go.
[339:25.43]it is capital fashion so I'm which now would go into the Earth tree that's the destination right
[339:51.42]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if Margit shows up.
[339:54.02]For like a fourth time.
[340:23.00]So this is the capital.
[340:24.38]This is all ash.
[340:25.96]Huh.
[340:32.12]This is depressing.
[340:38.12]I wonder if there's even any enemies here.
[340:56.29]This feels like it's just kind of a solemn walk up to the Erdtree.
[341:00.27]Okay.
[341:21.86]Is that an elevator?
[341:40.50]Anything else I can do over here?
[342:11.78]What does your belly button look like?
[342:13.39]It's like the size of a... It's like a half dollar.
[342:25.26]It's like this big around.
[342:26.62]I could actually put like stuff in it.
[342:32.18]If I have like change and stuff that can go in there.
[342:48.13]Okay, let's just go, I guess.
[342:50.37]Is there another Grace that I can go to?
[342:52.87]Capital is burning.
[342:55.17]Okay.
[342:55.41]Here we go.
[342:56.79]We're in the
[343:33.79]I told you he was a fucking asshole Take Gideon off near the all-knowing Okay, so why did he tell me to do this then?
[344:03.42]What's your fucking problem?
[344:17.92]Well, you're a real fucking chump, that's for sure.
[344:24.90]Unless, let me go, let me guess.
[344:26.44]It's got a phase to it.
[344:31.47]Okay, I'm gonna kill this guy right now.
[344:41.70]I just didn't know what he did.
[344:44.36]Does he have a rune?
[344:54.43]You actually died?
[344:55.57]He actually died to Gideon.
[344:57.60]Dude, we're going on 10 hours, man.
[344:59.30]What do you want me to say?
[345:07.96]It's right here.
[345:08.90]Okay.
[345:11.16]Let's fucking destroy this guy right now.
[345:15.88]So he's a mage.
[345:41.56]Fuck you, Gideon!
[346:14.92]Oh, that hurt me too!
[346:28.95]Okay, magic.
[346:30.97]Magic protection.
[346:31.71]I'm wearing... Excuse me.
[346:34.45]Magic protection.
[346:35.65]I need to put it on.
[346:36.55]I don't know what I'm doing.
[346:37.57]I don't know what I'm doing right now.
[346:40.22]I'm doing fucking Donald Trump.
[346:41.36]It's like fucking nine and a half hours, 1230.
[346:42.62]Fine.
[346:59.26]I'm gonna play this game, Gideon.
[347:01.38]I don't, I don't get this.
[347:03.89]Wasn't the whole time Gideon like, oh yeah, we have this place for you, Tarnished, and Tarnished, come and go, and we're gonna do the Elden Lord stuff.
[347:11.31]Yeah, go get the runes and become Elden Lord.
[347:13.31]Why is he, no, no, don't be Elden Lord, how dare you.
[347:15.83]What is he talking about?
[347:19.94]Wasn't he the one that wanted us to do this?
[347:23.23]Or does he just want to do it himself?
[347:25.63]I got news for you, Gideon.
[347:27.77]There ain't a chance in hell that you're... Actually, probably better than what I had.
[347:37.51]Yeah.
[347:40.66]I need magic.
[347:41.52]Magic defense.
[347:42.14]This guy doesn't do anything else besides magic.
[347:44.42]Magic?
[347:44.82]Oh, God.
[347:47.22]So many pieces of armor.
[347:48.24]I have no idea which is better.
[347:52.08]Royal Knight.
[347:52.82]Uh, some of these are probably better up here.
[347:54.26]Okay, whatever.
[348:06.85]Alright, you piece of shit.
[348:12.80]And I'm not gonna cast spells at him.
[348:14.70]I'm just gonna go bash his head in with this flail.
[348:24.66]Runes, who cares?
[348:29.87]I don't need them.
[348:54.33]I'm gonna fucking beat him, alright?
[348:55.85]No, I wanna see what's- I wanna see what's in that door.
[349:00.60]I wanna see what's in that door.
[349:02.48]It's right there.
[349:03.50]I'm not gonna- I know it's the final boss.
[349:05.74]I'm not- I just wanna see what's in the door.
[349:20.63]Holy shit, that hurt him a lot.
[349:40.72]And who could forget Sir Gideon Ophnir, the all-knowing... There he is!
[349:50.58]You drink?
[349:55.69]Hoarah Loux, Chieftain of the Badlands, the ever-knowing gold mass.
[350:04.49]THE DISGUSTING Dung Eater!
[350:08.05]AND OF COURSE, THIS SICK IDIOT OFF THERE!
[350:14.75]OH NO!
[350:15.25]WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY BRAIN?
[350:25.78]This dude is wicked high.
[350:26.80]Alright, I'm just gonna go in there and I'm gonna go in with my fists and I'm gonna fuckin' crush his head.
[350:35.25]He's actually throwing.
[350:36.51]I just, I'm fine.
[350:37.62]You gotta do a comedy one sometimes, okay?
[350:40.16]You gotta do a comedy one sometimes.
[350:43.08]That was a good strategy, and I'm gonna do it again.
[350:44.94]I'm sorry, everybody.
[350:48.26]I apologize.
[350:48.99]I do.
[350:49.17]I'm gonna stay across the fucking pole, though.
[351:21.39]now off our eyes he's tarnished he dead
[351:39.43]Die, you old fuck!
[351:44.19]Ain't nothin' in there, is there, Gideon?
[351:49.06]You're out of spell power, aren't you?
[351:58.92]Hey, butthead!
[351:59.96]Hey, Phoebus!
[352:06.13]Bones, a tarnished cannot become a lord.
[352:14.03]Not even you, a man, cannot kill a god.
[352:27.64]Sceptre of the Al- Oh, you get- He's got awesome armor.
[352:32.84]I love his armor.
[352:33.74]It's so cool looking.
[352:34.60]Can I put that on?
[352:36.39]I don't understand what his problem is.
[352:44.25]All-knowing helm.
[352:46.77]Helm set with countless eyes and ears, worn by Gideon Offner, the All-Knowing.
[352:50.86]Knowledge begins with the recognition of one's ignorance, the realization that the search for knowledge is unending.
[352:57.62]But when Gideon glimpsed into the will of Queen Marika, he shuddered in fear at the end that should not be.
[353:15.43]I love that helmet.
[353:16.91]I have to keep the head on.
[353:24.31]All knowing armor.
[353:28.13]Light.
[353:33.60]Really light.
[353:53.44]In case you didn't notice he had all the boss powers Okay, I that I'm now I
[354:16.42]It's time to go.
[354:17.52]I'm going in the yard tree.
[354:19.70]I'm going to lose, right?
[354:21.78]I don't think I'm going to beat this boss.
[354:23.20]I'm not prepared for it.
[354:26.38]Oh, the staff.
[354:28.34]He did have a staff.
[354:39.56]I've got an entire museum in my backpack.
[354:42.77]Honest to God, where is it?
[354:49.71]It is int scaling.
[354:53.53]Tepter in the form of a hand grasping a pearl, signature weapon of Sir Gideon Ofner, the All-Knowing.
[354:58.35]Pearl stands for the world, the heavens, and an eye, representing the many forms of knowledge, never fully attainable.
[355:08.08]Even knowing that, the All-Knowing's hand grasps for it.
[355:12.42]Knowledge above all.
[355:17.47]Raise the scepter to manifest the realm of the all-knowing.
[355:20.58]Enemy magic and holy damage negation will be reduced for all within the area, including the caster.
[355:32.41]What?
[355:40.92]This is a weapon.
[355:47.40]This is not a staff.
[355:50.16]This is an actual swinging weapon.
[355:54.31]Cool.
[355:59.27]It's a mace.
[356:01.35]Oh, shit, it is.
[356:03.25]That's really cool.
[356:04.19]I'm going to have to check that out.
[356:06.56]I mean, literally, we're at the end of the game, but whatever.
[356:14.25]Alright.
[356:14.97]We're going on 10 hours.
[356:16.17]I know.
[356:16.51]I've got to speed things up here.
[356:17.73]I want to go in this door.
[356:18.51]I just need to know.
[356:19.31]I want to see Queen Marika.
[356:21.15]She's definitely fucking in there.
[356:23.77]She's definitely in there.
[356:28.30]Guaranteed.
[356:30.90]I want to see Queen Marika.
[356:46.14]We need to go up to the Erdtree entrance place, which is up here, right?
[357:01.15]He has returned.
[357:01.79]The Lord has returned at long last.
[357:04.08]Our very first Lord to brandish the Elden Ring once more.
[357:25.37]Are you talking about me?
[357:34.86]I didn't think I had to jump.
[357:35.92]I thought I was just going to fall on it.
[357:46.88]And Sir Gideon Arthur arrives.
[357:50.78]He tarnished.
[357:52.38]He dead.
[357:54.28]Who lives.
[358:01.89]That intro is so good.
[358:06.17]It's a great intro.
[358:07.87]It almost feels like it's promoting a wrestling event.
[358:14.74]Like, hype up all these superstars.
[358:20.98]How many times have you watched it?
[358:22.38]Well, at least a couple of times.
[358:24.34]I'd say probably 20 times.
[358:40.33]Bird tree healed.
[358:46.30]I have any idea what the fuck is going on in this game.
[358:49.88]Vastly heals HP for self and nearby allies.
[358:53.50]One of the ancient Ur-Tree incantations.
[358:56.62]Heals a vast amount of HP for the caster and nearby allies.
[358:58.68]Hold to continue praying and delay activation.
[359:01.78]The Ur-Tree once flourished with abundance, yet it was only for a fleeting moment.
[359:07.12]Such is the course of all life.
[359:08.39]A moment?
[359:15.91]A fleeting moment.
[359:17.89]The Ur-Tree, like, actually had power.
[359:25.73]Alright, I wanna know.
[359:30.10]What the fuck is in here?
[359:34.24]What's in here?
[359:35.26]What is it?
[359:37.02]Here we go.
[359:42.78]I'm turning it up.
[360:01.17]It's been a long while Morgott Long and hard didst thou fight Tarnished warrior
[360:28.31]spurned by the Grace of gold.
[360:36.00]Be assured, the Elden Ring resteth close at hand.
[360:56.93]Who the fuck is this?
[360:57.51]Alas, I am returned.
[361:04.28]Wait, is that?
[361:07.94]To be granted audience once more.
[361:11.84]Godfrey?
[361:12.48]What?
[361:21.61]What is he?
[361:21.91]How did he?
[361:22.57]Upon my name as Godfrey.
[361:27.99]The first Elden Lord.
[361:36.83]Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.
[361:44.00]Where have you been this whole time?
[361:46.98]I was hiding behind that pillar over there for the last 600 game hours.
[361:52.42]You just didn't see me, but I was snooping.
[362:02.34]Damn, that was quick.
[362:08.72]So was that.
[362:18.77]Gotta jump.
[362:19.97]Gotta jump with that shit.
[362:21.48]Gotta jump.
[362:26.37]I didn't want to take a rune arc.
[362:27.77]I wanted to... Oh, that's not good.
[362:30.84]Bomb up.
[363:10.53]Dude, fucking stop kicking the ground, you dick!
[363:23.27]OY SHIT!
[363:42.07]DUDE!
[363:48.60]FUCK!
[363:50.24]YIKES!
[363:53.61]Mambo, you gotta help me here, man!
[363:57.19]Mambo, please!
[364:00.62]Mambo, please, help me!
[364:08.38]God!
[364:08.72]Two.
[364:15.65]Phase two.
[364:28.65]Oh no, now you gotta fight the goddamn lion.
[364:31.01]You gotta fight the lion.
[365:14.72]I've given thee courtesy enough.
[365:21.55]Turned into a Street Fighter character.
[365:40.37]Wait, the Chieftain of the Badlands?
[365:47.92]Wait, the Chieftain of the Badlands from the intro.
[366:06.97]Oh my god, he's actually fucking Zangief.
[366:16.56]That ain't gonna work against this, I don't think so.
[366:19.02]Oh, I don't know about that.
[366:27.16]I don't know about that.
[366:37.43]Wait, was this guy the whole game?
[366:38.65]Wait.
[366:39.31]Godfrey?
[366:40.01]I'm Godfrey.
[366:43.11]I'm Godfrey.
[366:43.73]No, I'm kidding.
[366:44.65]It's me.
[366:45.39]Horaloo.
[366:46.27]It's me.
[366:49.12]It's me.
[366:50.92]I'm Horaloo now.
[366:53.66]Horaloo is Godfrey.
[366:59.81]There's too many names in this game.
[367:09.69]I know it's time to go to bed.
[367:13.23]But let's round it out at 10 hours.
[367:42.20]Oh fuck off.
[367:44.02]Oh fuck you.
[367:44.64]Come on!
[368:05.22]Oh, it's a little early, but I'm fine.
[368:20.79]Oh, fuck.
[368:21.45]Too greedy.
[368:21.93]Let me do it again.
[368:28.10]I thought he was going to hit phase two.
[368:30.22]I was really thinking that was phase two.
[368:38.80]That wasn't bad.
[368:45.60]Mambo's getting his ass beat.
[368:46.92]Mambo is making me happy.
[368:53.16]He's the chieftain of the Badlands when he's just hanging out.
[368:55.36]That doesn't make any sense.
[369:13.41]not close enough don't jump into it what are you stupid
[370:07.91]Oh shit!
[370:08.89]That's bad, I'm dead.
[370:34.23]Big kick!
[370:48.95]What the fuck?!
[370:49.85]Those are the suplexes!
[371:12.52]Jesus Christ!
[371:21.61]I'm getting so fucked up here, dude!
[371:30.54]I'm getting so fucked up!
[371:32.52]I'm getting so fucked up!
[371:36.09]Dude, I'm getting so fucked up here!
[371:40.38]I don't fucking have any idea what happened here.
[371:43.00]I don't have any fucking idea what's going on.
[371:50.24]Jesus!
[371:51.20]No!
[371:52.64]There's so much going on!
[371:58.40]Just get away from me!
[372:12.79]Grow!
[372:14.17]Oh, I'm dead.
[372:30.70]Okay.
[372:36.56]Casting is too slow.
[372:40.20]Oh, I got the magic resist gear on.
[372:41.70]Shit.
[372:44.99]Somebody say... You can't say so bad.
[372:47.29]Oh, come on, man.
[372:54.38]That was... This fight is fucking cool.
[372:58.52]You gotta get...
[373:10.61]I don't know, should I just go full oven mitts?
[373:26.29]Okay, I'm ready.
[373:34.70]I am going to wait to summon my buddy.
[373:39.26]He'll have phase two.
[374:01.35]Oh shit, he doesn't...
[374:25.27]How sloppy as FUCK you forgot, I tell ya!
[374:57.67]Get the fuck out of here.
[374:58.63]Let's go.
[374:59.03]Come on, Gwen.
[375:00.35]Come on, Gwen.
[375:24.43]This guy's just fucking beating the shit out of me.
[376:08.58]Oh my god!
[376:24.73]Oh fuck you, bro!
[376:39.73]I had to do that.
[376:40.27]Oh, no.
[376:40.45]This is bad fucking news, isn't it?
[376:49.74]Oh, shit.
[376:57.64]Oh, I'm dead.
[377:01.08]Stop healing in front of him.
[377:02.56]Dude, he just fucking... He's so fast.
[377:10.38]Actually, there's probably not a window to summon in Phase 2, you're right.
[377:16.12]Going like, ding ding ding ding!
[377:17.82]No, you're fucking dead.
[377:21.88]I got him, I got him, I got him.
[377:24.57]Try to summon right before Phase 2.
[377:25.95]That's the play.
[377:27.73]Because you gotta get somebody.
[377:32.91]He's just so relentless.
[377:38.23]Alright, let's go.
[377:39.33]This fight's fucking awesome, by the way.
[377:40.72]This is the best fight in the whole game.
[377:42.62]This is the best fight in the game.
[377:44.60]I will stand by that.
[377:53.22]I gotta wait a second for this.
[377:56.02]I should, yeah.
[377:56.68]Let's just go.
[377:59.40]Let's just be balls...
[378:24.00]Oops.
[378:25.76]Oops.
[378:53.07]No mana, thog!
[379:13.00]Alright, come on!
[379:21.04]Oh my god.
[379:21.64]Alright, I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.
[379:33.81]Here we go.
[379:36.93]Ugh.
[379:43.42]Get in there, Mambo.
[379:44.12]Come on.
[379:59.13]Come on.
[379:59.33]Shit!
[379:59.49]I thought he was going for Mambo.
[380:01.99]Mambo, please.
[380:02.89]Get aggro, please.
[380:03.68]Come on.
[380:18.11]Oh shit!
[380:49.43]Oh shit.
[381:22.16]Sit down!
[381:25.78]I almost fucked it up like three times.
[381:33.97]Remembrance of Hoarah Loux.
[381:37.81]But dude, who's Godfrey?
[381:47.63]The same person.
[381:48.53]It's the same guy.
[381:53.94]That was the best fight in the game.
[382:01.45]By far.
[382:02.01]That was by far the coolest fight in the whole game.
[382:19.07]Is it health or is it endurance?
[382:30.63]Tough but fair.
[382:31.59]Yeah.
[382:34.67]That was so fun.
[382:36.09]God, that was the best fight in the game.
[382:38.09]I wish I could do that again.
[382:41.47]And the remembrance.
[382:42.15]I think I'm gonna do endurance, right?
[382:44.55]Like, that's the safe thing to do.
[382:47.53]I wanna read this, because... So what, people... You change your name?
[382:56.01]Oh, I'm Godfrey, but I'm also Horilu.
[383:00.63]I don't get it.
[383:01.03]Where is it?
[383:04.29]This is a paragraph.
[383:15.86]When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was robbed of his Grace, becoming tarnished, he took with him his kinfolk and left the Lands Between.
[383:25.99]After the long march of the Tarnish came to an end, Godfrey divested himself of kingship, becoming a simple warrior once more.
[383:36.39]Godfrey got exiled and then changed his name.
[383:46.60]Hurry up and end the stream.
[383:47.44]The Europeans are going to wake up any second now.
[383:50.40]I look so awful today.
[383:51.50]I'm the sweatiest I've been probably in the last...
[383:56.32]Month, at least.
[383:57.38]This is the sweatiest stream by far.
[383:59.02]Alright, Lore Masters, I need to ask a question.
[384:02.02]If I go in... If I go in there and see what's in there... Does the game end?
[384:15.03]No.
[384:15.69]Okay.
[384:19.06]Only if I... Okay.
[384:19.82]Okay.
[384:22.90]I kind of want to, let me see what's over there.
[384:24.97]I know we're going really late, but let me just see what's in here.
[384:33.33]Where was I going?
[384:33.99]Oh yeah.
[384:37.44]Okay.
[384:37.66]So do the other fingers are going to talk to me now?
[384:46.75]Dude, what are you doing?
[384:52.94]What the fuck?
[384:56.81]They just fucked off, they don't care anymore.
[384:58.67]Okay, I wanna see what this, um, remembrance is.
[385:16.01]But if you're dead, how are you doing this?
[385:20.40]Axe of Godfrey.
[385:21.72]Dex strength, 42 strength.
[385:23.70]Damn.
[385:25.76]Weapon of Godfrey, Elden Lord.
[385:26.84]It was broken in a battle fought as leader of the Tarnished during the Long March.
[385:31.92]This weapon is symbolic of Godfrey's vow to conduct himself as a lord, later becoming an emblem of the Golden Lineage.
[385:38.08]In the days of the past, a crown was warranted with strength.
[385:43.24]Or, Orilu's Earthshaker.
[385:48.58]Four loose earthshakers slam both hands into the ground.
[385:50.64]Okay, that's awesome.
[385:57.16]Heavy.
[385:58.24]This is strength stuff.
[386:02.40]They said they wouldn't talk for thousands of years.
[386:06.86]Creed Goffrey's Icon Talisman.
[386:08.70]Do I have that?
[386:26.63]I don't have it.
[386:29.05]Alright.
[386:29.64]It's time to go in there.
[386:31.18]I'm not going to use either one of these.
[386:32.42]But I'm not going to break it.
[386:33.22]Because in case.
[386:33.78]I don't want to just lose the souls.
[386:35.32]It's time to see what the fuck is inside the tree.
[386:38.00]Finally.
[386:38.32]Let's do it.
[386:58.94]What's in here?
[388:31.24]Title theme.
[389:02.84]Radagon of the Golden Order?
[389:28.36]Damn!
[389:31.72]Alright, there's a little bit of delay on that.
[389:57.35]Thought I could jump it.
[390:04.85]Oh shit!
[390:05.25]Okay, I gotta stay behind him.
[390:13.71]Don't blast it!
[390:33.65]Not bad, it's not bad.
[390:46.96]Oh, fuck.
[391:04.44]Oh my goodness.
[391:05.06]Okay, you gotta run.
[391:07.60]I just want to see phase two.
[391:11.38]I just want to see phase two and I'm done.
[391:21.51]Radagon.
[391:22.05]I just want to see phase two.
[391:25.03]Because this is not the fight.
[391:31.03]Mom said it's my turn to be Elden Lord.
[391:33.52]So what?
[391:34.10]I don't get it.
[392:06.90]How do you get away?
[392:18.58]I think you have to dodge through it.
[392:32.92]Dude!
[392:42.42]Fuck.
[392:43.40]Oh, my God.
[392:48.03]Okay.
[392:48.61]I just want to see fucking phase two.
[392:54.98]Okay.
[393:16.46]oh my god I just want to see you turn into another monster or something
[393:53.55]I gotta get that down if I'm gonna see phase two!
[394:13.82]Dude, I don't know where the fuck to go.
[394:15.64]Why is there no face?
[394:16.48]Oh.
[394:20.86]Oh, I get it.
[394:38.94]TELL ME PHASE 2!
[394:57.07]I gotta- I don't know.
[394:57.71]Phase 2.
[395:05.99]I got it.
[395:06.35]I'll get it.
[395:06.69]I'll get it.
[395:07.07]I'll get it.
[395:07.37]I'll get it.
[395:07.71]This is fun.
[395:12.90]You gotta earn things.
[395:14.13]It's so late.
[395:19.33]I know.
[395:19.61]I'm so sorry.
[395:20.19]This is so bad.
[395:21.83]But, I gotta go for it.
[395:42.66]Oh, you do it twice?
[396:04.06]What's this horseshit?
[396:08.82]That was a bad fucking combo.
[396:09.82]That was dog shit, y'all know it.
[396:13.46]This dog shit, y'all know it.
[396:16.79]I've never seen him do that fucking move.
[396:23.45]Like, what is doing that?
[396:30.24]Oh, come the fuck on.
[396:41.17]That's a lot of damage.
[397:10.25]Dude, stop doing that!
[397:11.49]He's done that move like 50 times this time!
[397:14.37]Do something else!
[397:39.23]Oh my god, you're gonna drive me fucking crazy!
[397:41.41]He just, like, rocked my head back!
[397:49.29]He just kept throwing those stupid fucking spears!
[397:52.07]He did it, like, ten fucking times!
[397:54.79]Stop doing that move, do something else!
[397:56.58]You have, like, forty moves!
[398:01.54]I just wanna see, I just wanna see face to face.
[398:04.35]You keep getting hit?
[398:05.01]Yeah, because it's like... He goes... Boom!
[398:08.17]Then they explode.
[398:08.87]And sometimes he does two.
[398:10.11]Sometimes he does two.
[398:11.27]This game should... This game is a three out of ten.
[398:14.43]It's a three.
[398:24.76]Wait, I can summon in here?
[398:30.20]Oh shit, I can summon.
[398:31.27]I didn't think it would be allowed in here.
[398:35.46]Fighting a fucking Elden Lord?
[398:37.32]I don't remember your name in the intro, dickhead!
[398:41.06]Dude, shut my face fucking too already so I can go to bed!
[398:57.19]I just wanna see what it is!
[399:00.75]Can Mambo help me?
[399:11.71]Oh no!
[399:12.15]He got clobbered!
[399:13.87]That was so sad!
[399:18.53]You didn't... Mambo!
[399:20.51]What the fuck is that?
[399:23.48]Get him, Mambo!
[399:36.48]Oh, Mambo's way outmatched here, I think.
[399:38.43]Like, this is... I just got glassed.
[399:47.93]I'm doing it again.
[399:48.73]Um, what?
[400:12.71]Show me phase two.
[400:13.49]Let's see it.
[400:17.87]He's too incoming!
[400:18.83]Mambo, just touch him, please.
[400:24.15]Did it.
[400:29.14]Mambo, settle down.
[400:30.22]Save your strength.
[400:30.88]You're gonna need it.
[401:06.00]Dude, what are the fingers?
[401:10.12]I don't get it.
[401:31.22]What is that?
[402:01.55]Elden Beast combo.
[402:04.93]Hold on Oh Yeah, we can't even get over there novel was a good run I
[402:31.21]Oh, she just liquified him.
[402:32.35]Mama just got liquified.
[402:54.48]Yeah.
[403:01.02]Oh my god.
[403:01.66]Okay, you guys ought to screw that.
[403:24.99]What are these?
[403:28.03]What is this?
[403:28.45]I don't get it.
[403:36.70]Is there just fingers?
[403:39.42]To talk to people?
[403:42.00]Alright, uh, is... Do I have to do phase two again?
[403:44.40]Do I have to do phase one again?
[403:47.43]Probably.
[404:00.88]Dude, they really want... They really want to fuck you up here, huh?
[404:07.59]They're really looking to just fuck your whole shit up, huh?
[404:14.56]Alright, well that's cool.
[404:16.12]I'm definitely not doing this tonight.
[404:18.44]We'll come back to this.
[404:24.15]We'll have to go back.
[404:29.01]I'm just doing... I'm just... I just spit everywhere.
[404:32.23]I'm not even playing.
[404:33.13]Look, I'm not even playing.
[404:34.27]I'm just, like, sitting around.
[404:36.42]It's not even me playing the game.
[404:39.04]See?
[404:39.14]He just hit me so bad.
[404:40.26]I'm dead.
[404:40.64]I'm gonna die right here.
[404:42.02]He hit me so hard.
[404:43.08]I'm not even playing.
[404:49.24]See?
[404:49.52]Look, I fucking got hit by a regular attack.
[404:51.24]Are you kidding me?
[404:52.50]What a shitty player, right?
[404:57.54]I don't even have any mana.
[404:59.01]I'm not even trying.
[405:00.07]I'm not even playing.
[405:37.47]Oh my god, how do you get away from that?
[405:58.35]You gotta be shitting me.
[406:01.79]Am I seriously too far away?
[406:29.02]I'm not even playing, just checking it out.
[406:38.90]Jeremy can pick his own bedtime.
[406:41.94]Okay, Elden Beast.
[406:45.08]I'm gonna get in close.
[406:46.46]Stay right behind you.
[406:47.18]I'm gonna just, I don't know, stay underneath.
[407:09.46]You don't want me to sit- Oh my god.
[407:10.42]Here we go.
[407:19.10]You're so fucking far away.
[407:20.66]Can I get on the horse?
[407:21.40]Christ.
[407:31.07]Um, what do I fucking do here?
[407:55.32]This is not where you're supposed to be.
[407:58.01]Alright, goodnight.
[407:58.49]I'll see you later.
[408:02.33]I don't have any heals left.
[408:13.10]Whose hand is that?
[408:14.46]I don't get it.
[408:29.30]It's aliens.
[408:31.77]Alright, I'm done.
[408:32.39]That's enough.
[408:33.03]That's enough.
[408:33.54]Okay.
[408:34.08]That's enough.
[408:36.50]Well, there's the Elden Beast.
[408:43.21]And, okay.
[408:45.51]This guy told me.
[408:48.27]Where was he?
[408:52.77]What is this?
[408:53.20]Is this guy still around?
[409:04.24]The Three Fingers.
[409:05.91]What the fuck are the fingers?
[409:07.75]The Two Fingers.
[409:09.13]The Three Fingers.
[409:09.67]The Elden Beast.
[409:10.45]I don't understand.
[409:32.71]I can't believe that dude aban- that- that Two Fingers abandoned us, and we're in the tree, and this motherfucker doesn't care.
[409:38.65]I hope he'll be back in 10,000 years.
[409:43.63]Or shit.
[409:50.24]Where you at?
[409:52.30]Honestly.
[410:03.47]Still is just hanging out there.
[410:17.34]Well, okay.
[410:24.76]Pretty cool.
[410:27.53]I'm going to bed.
[410:29.54]Have a wonderful evening.
[410:30.86]Have a wonderful sleep, everybody.
[410:32.72]Sorry we went so long.
[410:35.31]There was a lot going on today.
[410:36.53]We did bro versus bro with Ludwig.
[410:38.73]We got to the end of Elden Ring.
[410:41.59]I didn't beat it, but here we are.
[410:42.65]Damn.
[410:46.93]Very cool.
[410:47.50]I have a lot more questions, though.
[410:52.72]The next stream... I will see you guys on Sunday.
[411:00.68]We'll go Sunday.
[411:01.32]So, nothing today, technically, and then nothing on Saturday.
[411:08.38]I'm going to try to beat Elden Ring on Sunday.
[411:15.57]Hopefully.
[411:20.31]Check the god-free armor.
[411:26.62]Uh, didn't I?
[411:49.58]so many armors.
[411:50.34]Where is it?
[411:54.62]Oh, it's at the Finger Lady.
[411:56.36]Right, okay.
[412:08.45]Elden Lord Crown.
[412:11.97]The Age of the Erdtree began amongst conflict when Godfrey was Lord of the Battlefield.
[412:16.86]He led the war against the giants, faced the Storm Lord alone.
[412:20.71]And then there came a moment when his last worthy enemy fell.
[412:23.91]And it was then, as the story is told, that the hue of Lord Godfrey's eyes faded.
[412:40.60]I didn't register any of them.
[412:42.28]No, I didn't.
[412:46.96]Godfrey fought... Asadusax.
[412:49.99]The dragon.
[412:55.67]And... Got... Four or five extra sweet sours in his bag.
[413:04.90]And I was, like, really happy about it.
[413:07.84]Because you get to save them.
[413:09.89]You're only going to use one.
[413:16.07]Okay, there's a lot.
[413:17.57]I'm going to watch the baddie video.
[413:22.80]Wasn't that dragon was an Elden Lord?
[413:24.88]What the fuck is an Elden Lord?
[413:26.40]I keep hearing these terms and I don't know really what any of them actually mean.
[413:30.82]Oh, tarnished.
[413:32.80]Two Fingers.
[413:35.16]Elden Lord.
[413:35.48]Elden Lord.
[413:38.33]Elden Lord.
[413:39.32]So, a dragon was Elden Lord, which means that the greater will, right?
[413:49.17]Like, yeah, that's fine.
[413:50.19]The dragon's, uh, Elden Lord.
[413:52.57]This, this guy killed the dragon, and, like, became Elden Lord, and they were like, oh, shit.
[413:59.24]Um, okay.
[414:00.32]Okay.
[414:10.63]Harness your people who Lost Grace.
[414:12.01]But what is Grace?
[414:15.41]What does that mean?
[414:19.63]Elden Lord is like a God's chosen person.
[414:25.00]Grace is the guidance of God.
[414:31.42]It's the guidance of the greater will.
[414:33.36]Okay.
[414:43.19]But why did I burn the Erdtree?
[414:46.15]What are we doing in here?
[414:54.61]Just because you wanted to get inside.
[414:55.87]To get the Elden Ring, you idiot.
[415:03.54]Because the world sucks.
[415:14.97]Okay, I guess that makes sense.
[415:16.97]I'm very interested in the lore, I really am.
[415:23.44]So is the Greater Will and the Erdtree the same entity?
[415:30.70]What the fuck is the Erdtree?
[415:36.90]Why is the Erdtree even here?
[415:39.18]Who planted that shit?
[415:41.65]Who planted the Erdtree?
[415:44.92]What is the howling tree?
[415:46.06]Why is there a howling tree?
[415:47.84]Why is there so many... Why do those people have trumpets?
[415:51.03]Why are some of those trumpets?
[415:56.07]Alright.
[416:01.25]Alright.
[416:01.49]I'll see you guys.
[416:01.95]I'll see you later.
[416:03.35]I'll see you on Sunday.
[416:09.78]Why do they have trumpets, Batty?
[416:12.00]Please tell us.
[416:17.30]very interesting that's cool though so Hoarah Loux is godfrey godfrey we fought godfrey's yellow shade in the why was he not here remember it was like he was bright and gold and we fought him in that before the throne room and then he shows up again later oh hey it's me godfrey was that him fighting us was it somebody pretending to be him
[416:53.79]I don't know.
[416:57.55]It was a force ghost.
[417:02.85]Okay.
[417:04.07]It's cool, yeah.
[417:06.11]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[417:07.37]Just go with it.
[417:08.55]I am just very curious.
[417:11.01]What is... Gideon...
[417:17.70]So Badly was like, oh, you are gonna stand... Wasn't he like, oh, we both... You're gonna stand before the Elden Lord.
[417:24.46]Oh, that's what we Tarnish do.
[417:25.82]That's what we do.
[417:27.22]Don't go stand in front of the Elden Lord, you dick.
[417:30.50]Okay, alright.
[417:46.75]Watch a lore video?
[417:48.37]I think there's still more to know, because obviously this is an end of the game, which is going to be something, right?
[417:53.62]Alright.
[417:54.42]I'll see you guys later.
[417:55.04]Thanks for watching.
[417:55.50]Thanks for staying up late.
[417:56.64]That was a meaty one.
[417:57.88]This is the longest stream I've done in a long time.
[418:01.44]I think the first, second, or third Elden Ring stream is pretty long.
[418:06.74]Would I give this game a 3?
[418:08.54]We'll bump it up a little bit.
[418:09.54]It's like a 9.7.
[418:10.12]Maybe.
[418:20.31]That's cool.
[418:21.19]What a cool game.
[418:23.73]Is it weird that I'm sad?
[418:26.73]I'm kind of sad.
[418:29.31]It's not over yet, but it will be really soon.
[418:34.87]Sad.
[418:38.55]We'll get another stream out of it.
[418:42.83]I still have to rage quit Malenia again.
[418:48.11]I've got to kill the last boss.
[418:53.81]Pretty much it.
[419:00.12]Ending of playing your first playthrough of a masterpiece is always sad.
[419:04.30]Yeah, I kind of look at the map.
[419:06.40]I'll go to bed in a second.
[419:07.62]It's just like...
[419:10.56]This was a... This was a journey.
[419:12.40]This was absolutely a journey.
[419:14.32]I have no idea what the hell's really going on, but... It sure was fun walking around.
[419:18.57]See the sewers as well.
[419:26.45]Three Fingers.
[419:34.08]I did fight Mohg.
[419:35.68]Yep.
[419:37.18]I killed... Yep, I killed Rykard.
[419:39.20]I killed Mohg...
[419:43.64]Very cool.
[419:45.88]No, it's fantastic.
[419:46.92]It is.
[419:49.79]Well, think about this, right?
[419:51.57]I will leave you with this.
[419:55.37]I have been playing this game a lot.
[419:59.03]We have officially passed more than a month of playing this game.
[420:07.17]Every single time I turn the screen on.
[420:10.04]In a month.
[420:12.96]I can't remember the last... Even other FromSoftware games, I can't remember the last time that a game has kept my attention for more than 100 hours.
[420:24.36]I don't think so.
[420:28.95]Nothing has kept my attention for this long.
[420:33.15]But Elden Ring streams are not going to stop.
[420:35.57]Because I'm going to try to beat the game.
[420:38.20]Let's hope I do it.
[420:39.42]I will eventually, right?
[420:40.34]Um...
[420:43.65]I want to do an invasion, like PvP summon night.
[420:46.45]I think that'd be fun.
[420:50.08]Do some like... Have like a community password and just fuck around.
[420:54.62]Also might need to do the Mii Strong stream.
[420:59.38]Yeah, I'm not done with it.
[421:01.00]The game is too good to leave it completely.
[421:04.15]Oh, it's April Fools.
[421:15.96]I got nothing for you.
[421:16.56]I'm too tired to have anything for you.
[421:23.53]I'm gonna do something weird.
[421:30.67]Here's the joke.
[421:34.11]Happy April Fools, everybody.
[421:37.59]Beating the game tonight.
[421:41.93]I'm j- I'm kidding, I'm kidding, it's a joke.
[421:44.95]Look at my eyes.
[421:49.36]God, I look like... My face looks... I look weird.
[422:04.09]You have beady eyes.
[422:04.91]Stop.
[422:07.71]Do a tier list.
[422:10.95]Legit do it.
[422:11.67]I'm not... I can't.
[422:13.77]That was a joke.
[422:14.21]I'll see you later.
[422:18.81]99 hours?
[422:20.29]I'm gonna go over 100, come on.
[422:25.25]Alright, good night.
[422:26.39]Thanks for watching as always.
[422:27.33]I'll see you guys later.
[422:28.21]See you on Sunday.
[422:32.18]Somewhere around 4 o'clock Pacific.
[422:35.00]We will try to beat this game.
[422:37.04]Do some of the other stuff that is in the game.
[422:41.86]And depending on how long that takes...
[422:44.84]We will potentially go into some PvP stuff.
[422:48.19]Maybe I'll do some summoning stuff if you guys want to summon me to your game.
[422:52.69]You want to summon me, Jerma985, to come and visit your game.
[422:58.81]That's right.
[422:59.93]One of you lucky few will get Jerma985 to come and enter your game.
[423:15.77]Help me fight Millenia.
[423:17.25]Okay.
[423:20.05]Maybe we should just Mario Party Millenia.
[423:21.59]It doesn't matter.
[423:30.73]We Mario Partied the dragon in Dark Souls 3.
[423:33.70]And I don't think we even beat it.
[423:35.76]I think I had three or four of you guys come in.
[423:39.50]And we still couldn't do it.
[423:52.11]Do a hamburger helper tier list.
[423:55.56]I will be very upset if you do that.
[424:00.56]That fight sucks.
[424:01.66]It's so bad.
[424:02.56]This is too much.
[424:06.76]I definitely... Okay, before trying to do Millenia, like really grind out the hours to put into Millenia and beat Millenia, I'm going to have a full breakfast.
[424:19.23]I'm going to have to take some vitamins.
[424:22.35]I'm gonna need a full, like, eight hours of sleep.
[424:25.66]I need to be ready.
[424:26.54]Do a FromSoftware boss tier list.
[424:35.75]That actually sounds like fun.
[424:37.19]Although I don't really remember all that much of some of the other games.
[424:43.39]I would need some refreshing.
[424:45.00]That'd be fun.
[424:55.04]Well, thanks for taking the journey as always.
[424:58.86]Have a good night.
[425:02.33]Call your mother.
[425:03.79]See you guys soon.
[425:21.91]Good night.
[426:00.46]you
