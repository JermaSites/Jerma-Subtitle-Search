[02:38.91]Are you guys ready?
[02:41.29]I don't know how large of a stream this is going to be.
[02:44.53]I don't really expect this to be one of those like big, huge, wild number streams.
[02:52.15]But I do want to complete this.
[02:53.19]A lot of people were getting not necessarily sick of this game, but I don't really like to do the same game four streams in a row.
[03:05.43]But I'm very into it.
[03:06.51]I want to complete it.
[03:07.15]And if you're here to watch it, then...

[03:37.88]Dropping big stacks of cash at the very beginning of the stream.

[03:43.03]Benny Jets, thanks for the 31 cents.
[03:44.41]Don't say anything.
[03:44.91]Well, actually, they do.
[03:45.51]They gave 26 cents before that and said, what the fuck?
[03:47.93]I don't know why.
[03:51.41]And then Snooze, thank you, Snooze, for the 30 cents.

[03:58.02]Male student or female student?
[04:00.82]I was going to say Big Al.
[04:04.46]I don't know why I was going to say Big Al.
[04:06.12]All Might.
[04:08.23]is my favorite character in that whole show he's the only reason why I like the show that character is the only part of that show that I like as weird as that is big al he's the best part um but I don't I don't I don't really like any of the other characters I just like when all might punches people that's why I watch 40 episodes of that show
[04:41.05]But thanks, man.
[04:43.03]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[04:44.39]I came in to check the sus and the stream started.
[04:48.06]Champ.
[04:49.20]And hey, Andoxin00.
[04:50.70]Thanks, that's pretty much it.
[04:52.22]I missed a lot of past streams, so what is this furry meme?
[04:54.90]And why are you in a Garfield suit on the subreddit?
[04:58.60]I don't know, because people... There's this new thing people can do now.
[05:02.12]It's magic.
[05:02.68]It really is magic.
[05:03.74]Photoshop is magic now, guys.
[05:05.70]Because think about it.
[05:06.54]We live in a world...
[05:08.12]where you used to have to cut somebody's face out of a picture that you developed and paste it shittily on another picture as a joke and it didn't look real at all.
[05:18.93]We live in the new world where anybody can turn you into anything.
[05:25.20]Somebody can take a photo of you and realistically make you something else at their own discretion.
[05:33.03]We're gonna have a lot of weird shit over the next, like, ten years.
[05:36.53]Where people are gonna... Think about, like, VR.
[05:39.20]What happens when, like, the Photoshop of the hologram world comes out and you can just make me in your living room?
[05:46.40]In... You're just in your living room hanging out with your friends and you can make me say and do whatever you want.
[05:51.04]You can, like, punch me.
[05:52.08]You can, like, slap me in the face and shit and, like, spit on me.
[05:54.54]Like, I don't know if I like this.
[05:57.39]I don't know if I like this.
[06:01.05]creating false evidence.
[06:02.61]People could take a Photoshop of me with a shovel in my hand, digging a ditch somewhere, and looking into the camera with like a, oh shit face.
[06:13.69]And you could write like, oh hey, I caught this guy digging something, like he was burying somebody.
[06:18.17]You could have like a bag behind me.
[06:20.16]And you could post it on like the Jerma subreddit and be like, oh, hey, look, I actually I was driving down the street and some guy fucking killed someone and is burying them on the side of the road.
[06:30.47]And if you took that image back, if you took you printed it out, you got you put it on, you went to Photoshop, you went to print, printed it out, cut it up and brought it back 20 years.
[06:40.20]I would go to jail.
[06:43.34]I would go to prison.
[06:45.32]Because they would be like, this is you in this picture.
[06:47.78]It's like, no, it's not.
[06:48.72]Yes, it is.
[06:49.26]Like, this is you here.
[06:51.28]You dug this hole and this is a dead body behind you.
[06:55.68]We're talking about 20 years, not even like 100 years.
[06:58.73]20 years.
[07:02.01]I suppose, no, that would be real.
[07:09.17]Photoshop has a hidden watermark on anything edited.
[07:11.76]Yeah, but you wouldn't know that if you were in like the fucking 80s.
[07:15.60]You time travel back to like the fucking 1981.
[07:19.62]And you take that photo, because it would have to be physical because the internet didn't fucking exist.
[07:23.94]And you make a series of photoshops of me murdering people.
[07:27.77]And I would go to prison.
[07:29.03]Because that was what evidence was back in the day.
[07:31.37]Do you have any pictures of the guy doing it?
[07:34.35]Uh, yeah.
[07:34.71]Do you have any blood on your hands?
[07:36.51]Yes.
[07:36.75]Do you have any shitty surveillance video?
[07:39.57]No, we don't have that.
[07:40.60]Ah, two out of three.
[07:42.42]Guilty.
[07:45.14]80s were 40 years ago was it was it really no it wasn't was it really holy am I it's 40 years ago oh wow I'm I'm pretty old I guess then huh it's 40 years ago well I was just a baby
[08:12.85]I was just a baby back then, so it's not like me being as old as I am now.
[08:19.86]Right?
[08:21.82]What's with my controller?
[08:25.56]Okay, so the way we left off, I was in the Just Cause suit.
[08:30.42]Is this too loud?
[08:31.42]This is loud for some reason.
[08:32.58]Why is it so fucking loud for me?
[08:36.68]Who turned this up on my break?
[08:40.48]Who the fuck turned this up on my break?
[08:43.81]There we go.
[08:46.51]How's that?
[08:48.45]Let me get a couple more bits before we get started.
[08:50.31]Hey!
[08:52.79]Frexter, thanks for the $1.
[08:53.83]Looking forward to every single one of your streams.
[08:55.28]Thank you for being you.
[08:55.98]Thanks for sticking around.
[08:56.88]Thanks for watching, Frexter.
[08:58.96]And Doxin00, thanks for the $0.25.
[09:00.54]Jeez, man, I was just wondering what was going on.
[09:02.10]What the fuck are you talking about?
[09:05.74]Did you start that?
[09:08.75]Who started that?
[09:11.82]Somebody started that.
[09:12.46]I don't know who it was.
[09:13.58]Thank you, though.
[09:14.14]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1, or I could make a fake video of you killing somebody.
[09:19.28]It's on the horizon.
[09:20.52]All we need is material.
[09:21.46]By the way, can you use more webcam?
[09:24.11]I thought you said WebMD for a second, and I was like, I don't know why you want me to do that, but... Dude, it's on the horizon.
[09:30.77]Alright, we got a funeral.
[09:33.67]Actually, I gotta turn in one of these little rubber duckies to get extra points.
[09:43.62]So, yeah, I'll give my first impressions of the game.
[09:47.24]So, my first impression of this game so far.
[09:49.30]I think I can do that now.
[09:52.63]I'm waiting for that.
[09:53.57]I'm waiting for the day when people make first impression videos.
[09:57.37]Where they get to the very end of the game.
[09:58.69]Hey, you know, alright guys, so first impressions.
[10:02.15]I'm like 34 hours into the game.
[10:03.93]I think it's okay.
[10:05.41]I'd like to see where the story goes from here.
[10:07.52]I'm gonna get that joke.
[10:10.24]Alright, Mac, if you're watching...
[10:12.45]Which, I mean, you are.
[10:13.21]I mean, he's probably here.
[10:15.07]Mac, I'm gonna do, like, a first impressions video joke at the end of the game.
[10:19.04]So... It's gonna be fucking hilarious.
[10:25.78]Yeah, okay, guys.
[10:26.52]So, I think I'm ready to do my assessment here.
[10:29.32]It's been a little... I've had a little time in the game.
[10:30.66]First impressions.
[10:31.82]Graphics are a little tight.
[10:32.88]The graphics are a little tight here.
[10:35.61]Controls are a little... Could use a little bit of work.
[10:37.83]Let's see where it goes from here.
[10:39.69]At the credits.
[10:40.35]Picking me up.
[10:42.01]Thanks for the $15, Benny Jets.
[10:42.83]That's a bad joke.
[10:43.27]Thank you though, dude.
[10:43.83]Thanks for the $15, man.
[10:45.93]Repeat the joke 40 times.
[10:46.61]You fucking know who you're talking to?
[10:48.49]You know what stream you're in right now?
[10:51.12]We can get on something.
[11:10.60]And I don't stop doing it for like 30 minutes.
[11:13.44]And then we move on to something else.
[11:16.50]Do you know where you are?
[11:19.12]Bring yourself back on.
[11:19.96]I'm not doing another Westworld reference.
[11:21.52]Speaking of 30 minutes straight.
[11:27.36]That's like the name of the drug that I used to take.
[11:31.22]Azathioprine.
[11:33.14]I used to take that drug.
[11:35.80]Azathioprine.
[11:36.74]It was an immunosuppressant for colitis.
[11:39.61]I took it for like five years.
[11:41.33]Are we gonna go pick up like fucking azathioprine?
[11:43.21]Try to get a better car.
[11:47.56]Oh god.
[11:47.70]Drug addict?
[11:47.96]What I have was prescribed.
[12:07.37]It was a prescribed drug to help with the disease that I have.
[12:10.71]Gotta get fitted for it.
[12:14.76]Ah, nice graphics.
[12:16.26]Fuck, I couldn't make the nice graphics thing.
[12:18.08]God damn it.
[12:20.50]We missed our opportunity.
[12:22.88]We missed the T-pose accidental.
[12:25.24]Oh well, I tried.
[12:25.94]Your mom won't let you watch the stream.
[12:39.44]Um... Well, put me on speaker.
[12:47.47]Just put me on speakerphone.
[12:48.63]I'll convince her to let you watch the stream.
[12:53.50]I mean, by the time that she hears that, you know, this, then she'll know that, ah, no, you know, this is like educational and it's good smart TV.
[13:01.43]Works his brain a little bit.
[13:04.50]I'll wait like 20 or 30 seconds.
[13:06.16]I'll give you like a good like... Until you get it on speaker.
[13:09.77]Let's prove him wrong.
[13:21.78]Oh, yeah!
[13:23.64]Oh, whoopsie!
[13:24.12]Whoopsie daisy!
[13:26.24]Hey, guys!
[13:27.88]Do you ever... Do you ever go to the bathroom?
[13:32.06]We killed that guy!
[13:40.46]See at some point during that he freaked out and hit the mute button And now he's very very confusingly bumblingly trying to explain to his mother Oh god, that's not I you think I'm an idiot you think I'm a weirdo And now she is she's never gonna let you watch twitch.tv ever again because I just Gave her what exactly what she needed to hear
[14:10.28]I just, I just did so much confirmation bias for your mother.
[14:15.38]That I would be surprised if she ever let you use the computer again.
[14:22.02]That's our Jerma?
[14:23.80]Haha!
[14:25.62]I was doing a thing for a bit, come on!
[14:34.92]Minus one Jerma viewer.
[14:37.51]No, he'll do what I used to do.
[14:39.99]I used to have one of those old tube TVs in my bed.
[14:46.44]And I would just watch wrestling past my bedtime.
[14:51.26]It was one of those, VCR was inside the TV.
[14:54.11]The TV was probably like 16 inches or 15 inches or something.
[14:58.73]And I had it plugged into the wall, sitting on my lap.
[15:01.03]And when I heard my mother come in, I like, SWEEPED my compu- like, my, uh, covers over the whole thing, and turned.
[15:09.97]So it just looked like I was, and you wouldn't even be able to tell.
[15:13.39]I would hit the power button, covers, over the TV, turn.
[15:17.49]And my mother, you can always hear when your mother's coming because it's that.
[15:22.63]It's like, here she comes, she's right down the hall.
[15:24.08]Oh, here we go.
[15:24.58]I'm sleeping.
[15:25.64]She'd open the door and she'd be like.
[15:26.82]They're here to make a show.
[15:29.04]Or maybe to start a fight.
[15:30.78]And then when she was gone, I would take it out and turn it back on.
[15:34.16]I don't think they expected the police to be here, though.
[15:38.48]We've made this reference before, but I have to every time we talk about this.
[15:43.10]I used to do this shit all the time.
[15:44.52]I'm absolutely certain I've told this story before, but we can all relate to it.
[15:51.93]In the morning before school, when your mother was trying to get you up, or your father, whoever was trying to get you up, and you would do the thing where you pretended to be super awake.
[16:02.11]I do this on the phone, too.
[16:03.01]If somebody calls me, and I'm sleeping way past a reasonable human time,
[16:08.40]I go like this.
[16:09.07]Here we go again.
[16:09.65]So, phone rings.
[16:10.39]This is just the new adult way to do this.
[16:12.19]Talking over the cutscenes?
[16:12.91]Alright, just hold on.
[16:13.73]Let me talk over the cutscenes.
[16:14.95]The cops are leaving?
[16:15.67]What?
[16:37.58]You're not, though.
[16:38.54]You're a cop.
[16:38.98]I'll tell you in a second.
[16:41.82]Where are we at?
[16:43.80]Where are we?
[16:44.60]By the way, I should probably use the move that I own.
[17:12.67]Not anymore, one more.
[17:18.21]Alright, so, nah, I gotta have my hands on my remote for this one.
[17:25.97]Oh my god, sit down.
[17:27.69]Oh my god.
[17:32.47]Jeff way off cooldown?
[17:33.62]No, Jeff's not on- Jeff!
[17:35.60]Yeah, Jeff!
[17:38.32]good old jeff's not on cooldown yet oh my god they all just firing squad here I'm gonna have to jump over here we go three two
[18:04.55]Okay, speaking of grenades.
[18:07.39]There's a lot.
[18:08.97]I gotta... Let's be real here.
[18:21.52]I'm gonna... Okay.
[18:25.69]Hold on a second.
[18:26.91]Activate jet!
[18:53.11]Understood.
[18:53.61]Have not taken one point of damage, sir.
[19:16.92]Please insert more coins.
[19:19.23]Fuck.
[19:22.07]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[19:26.11]Jack's activated for a second time.
[19:55.63]Okay, I got the controller back.
[19:57.51]Thank God I had it for fucking Jack's coins.
[20:04.55]What do I have to do now?
[20:07.39]Flank the guy with the grenade launcher?
[20:11.39]Okay.
[20:14.43]How do I flank him?
[20:17.26]Oh, I gotta go this way.
[20:22.72]Jeff died to a grenade.
[20:27.27]Jeff died to a grenade.
[20:30.30]Oh no, he sure did.
[20:31.40]Oh my god, before he shoots another one.
[20:42.77]I give this to him.
[20:45.85]I want the grenade launcher.
[20:54.08]I get to finally use explosives!
[20:56.70]Wait, why'd they just, like, stomp?
[20:59.66]Oh, okay, we're good.
[21:05.66]I like how they do flips.
[21:10.74]What?
[21:13.78]One more.
[21:16.34]No, like, two more actually down here.
[21:22.98]Advance down the cemetery.
[21:24.10]You got it.
[21:32.24]Everything is chrome?
[21:34.45]What do you mean chrome?
[21:37.25]Eliminate the parking lot.
[21:40.41]Okay.
[21:40.69]I don't want to shoot a grenade here.
[21:42.01]Alright, I'm going to shoot the grenade at the car.
[21:49.86]God damn it.
[21:53.33]Be careful.
[21:54.25]Just gotta blow up one of the cars and then that'll be it.
[22:04.00]Bronze unlocked.
[22:05.04]Bronze what?
[22:06.02]How many more people are there?
[22:11.19]God damn it.
[22:11.81]I gotta stop it.
[22:22.21]There's a lot of people here right now.
[22:27.11]Where are these three people?
[22:32.37]Alright.
[22:33.37]I've literally laid waste to this whole place.
[22:39.56]How are you still alive?
[22:44.16]Two more.
[22:44.58]Alright there, peek out again.
[22:48.60]I dare ya.
[22:53.76]Last dude, where is he?
[22:55.04]He's right there.
[22:57.30]Can I come out of my safe?
[22:59.34]Statue, fuck.
[23:03.02]Did I seriously miss the statue?
[23:05.90]Fuck, I was just like aiming off the window.
[23:07.74]I wasn't even paying attention.
[23:08.56]Fuck.
[23:08.82]God damn it.
[23:19.80]He's still blinking.
[23:22.10]I can get back in.
[23:23.21]I can get back in here.
[23:24.45]It was so bright.
[23:26.79]Hey, you know what else is bright?
[23:28.73]Grenades exploding on the screen.
[23:31.19]Perhaps temporarily.
[23:32.81]We should go with... Wait.
[23:34.45]We need to have a proper election.
[23:36.71]That is the way it has always been done.
[23:39.35]It's the sun on you, Cole.
[23:41.75]You, a woman, talking of Cole.
[23:44.30]You should never have been allowed to be sun on you.
[23:46.36]But I was.
[23:47.48]And my contributions to this organization have been significant.
[23:51.22]With respect, I have to agree with Sister Jane.
[23:54.60]We need to restore stability and order.
[23:56.53]And that means clear thinking.
[23:58.68]We should follow our tradition.
[24:00.30]Our tradition?
[24:02.28]You've only been on Sanonyi for a short time.
[24:04.63]What do you know about our tradition?
[24:06.53]Hey, Ken Dalio, thanks for the $1.
[24:08.35]Talk like Kermit and get bits.
[24:11.53]Fine.
[24:13.99]Well, here you go.
[24:15.87]I think I could be the next Kermit if I really wanted to.
[24:17.98]Sound a little bit like Steve Whitmire, in a way.
[24:21.48]And he just got fired, so... Put your vote into me.
[24:25.24]Ricky!
[24:28.89]Hey, thank you, Pillshy, for the 15 bucks.
[24:32.59]Craygasm, craygasm, craygasm, craygasm.
[24:35.31]Been lurking for a couple years.
[24:36.47]Love what you do.
[24:37.00]Your channel is helping through some hard times.
[24:39.66]Craygasm, craygasm, craygasm.
[24:41.56]Thank you, man.
[24:42.34]Thank you, Pillshy.
[24:44.36]Appreciate it, dude.
[24:44.92]Take care of yourself, man.
[24:49.06]Hope that, uh... Hope that you're doing well.
[24:55.47]Big smiley.
[24:58.70]I did say that correctly.
[24:59.62]Okay.
[24:59.92]Funeral shirt.
[25:01.60]Fuck off.
[25:02.24]Windows.
[25:03.28]Before I have another meltdown.
[25:04.60]It's only been one this week.
[25:06.72]Don't want to do another one.
[25:07.83]I don't want a meltdown again.
[25:09.13]Windows.
[25:12.31]Okay.
[25:12.55]We got two tri-odd points.
[25:14.05]Tri-odd?
[25:14.59]Wait.
[25:16.61]Have I not done this?
[25:21.53]Apparently not.
[25:25.21]I'm all the way down here.
[25:27.95]Yeah, this is the last thing I couldn't do.
[25:30.17]Melee weapons do more damage and have more durability.
[25:32.04]I like this.
[25:32.58]I want it.
[25:32.98]It's the final one.
[25:34.98]Triod.
[25:35.56]And then we'll see if we have to do Rising Kick.
[25:40.80]Because it's the only other thing we don't have.
[25:43.33]Melee Training.
[25:43.95]I am pretty much at the end.
[25:48.51]Just have to go do this, do Arm Break, and then we get Dim Mak.
[25:59.35]follow-up strike on stunned opponents thank you radical corky for the 25 cents somebody say bits
[26:16.50]Also, wild.
[26:17.12]A buddy thanks for the $1.
[26:18.02]I can't believe this streamer had to use the Jax cheat code to get through the cementary attack.
[26:22.36]Thanks.
[26:24.02]It was cut off.
[26:25.29]It was cut off at the end of the stream lab, so it was cement and then another line, airy.
[26:35.69]Thanks, dude.
[26:36.31]Something big is going down.
[26:37.27]Meet us in North Point as soon as possible.
[26:41.91]Also, thank you to the Father Gear Rod Deli for the $5.50.
[26:47.17]Hey, Jerma, your content's always brought me more joy than this half dollar can make up for.
[26:54.64]But I thank you regardless.
[26:56.26]Don't ever change.
[26:57.84]Thank you, Father.
[27:02.18]I don't plan to.
[27:03.84]I don't know.
[27:04.58]Does anyone really know if they change or not?
[27:07.58]I feel like when you change, it happens so slowly and so...
[27:11.54]drawn out and drip feed over like a decade that you don't even know what happened but hopefully I'm similar than like I was five ten years ago I hope I'm not that different go get the statue I will don't worry give me my super we've got the fastest bike in the game
[27:40.38]Let me just do this statue first.
[27:44.37]Takes me decades to change my clothes.
[27:50.43]Decades to change your clothes.
[27:51.86]Well, I mean, do you mean what your fashion sense is?
[27:55.08]Because I've probably owned the same type of clothing for the last 10 years.
[28:01.42]That's what you mean by that.
[28:02.15]That doesn't mean what you do.
[28:03.09]Correct.
[28:03.41]I would agree with you.
[28:11.15]Look at all the Jupiters.
[28:11.97]What's going on with these Jupiters?
[28:17.00]Where has this taken me?
[28:26.64]Do I have any red boxes?
[28:28.67]No.
[28:29.33]I don't have red boxes.
[28:34.05]I think you can tell a lot by a man.
[28:36.15]Depending on what he wears to the underwear.
[28:39.57]Okay.
[28:40.93]There are boxers.
[28:43.29]There are briefs.
[28:44.00]And then there are boxer briefs.
[28:47.46]The in-between.
[28:48.74]The rational one.
[28:50.60]The free thinker.
[28:52.50]Doesn't want anyone to tell him what to do or how to act.
[28:54.60]Doesn't pick a team.
[28:55.56]Doesn't pick a side.
[28:57.30]Thinks for himself.
[28:58.92]Understands things.
[29:00.13]From both sides.
[29:01.69]The boxer brief man is a complete man.
[29:22.94]What about nothing?
[29:23.64]You're just anarchy.
[29:25.82]And we all know anarchy doesn't work.
[29:29.49]Support, but breathing room.
[29:32.75]Good work, Wei.
[29:33.83]You don't look well, Wei.
[29:35.65]Is everything alright?
[29:37.09]No, Sifu.
[29:38.11]What do you plan to do about it?
[29:39.72]Comfort.
[29:41.02]So if your punches are weak, that means they're destined to be weak.
[29:44.48]And security.
[29:45.64]Or is it true that through practice and concentration, you can change?
[29:50.32]Some problems are harder to solve than a weak punch, Sifu.
[29:53.28]Watch my students for a minute.
[29:56.05]You may change your mind.
[29:59.96]What would you like to learn?
[30:03.40]The one thing I need to learn... Yeah, I'm not going to get to the last move ever.
[30:07.43]I have to replay that mission.
[30:09.61]Alright, stun grapple follow-up.
[30:10.83]Let's try it.
[30:15.19]So this is just hold.
[30:16.29]Alright, so it's a finisher.
[30:21.33]So you stun.
[30:21.96]Get him on the stun.
[30:23.62]Oh, no, he's dead.
[30:27.72]When they stun, you just hold B and you do a finish.
[30:29.98]That's cool.
[30:32.01]Just go back to the place.
[30:32.75]Okay, I will.
[30:39.69]How many times do I have to punch this poor guy in the face?
[30:50.04]Okay, that was getting a little ridiculous.
[30:53.94]Let's try it.
[30:56.12]There we go.
[31:06.17]Stun Grapple follow-up.
[31:07.63]And goodnight.
[31:08.69]Yeah, I would not want to be a student here either.
[31:20.04]This chat room is now in... funny mode.
[31:25.82]Naked freedom?
[31:27.60]No, that's not how it works.
[31:31.48]It's not naked freedom.
[31:37.07]Alright, where... Let me look at something first.
[31:46.70]We just gotta get there.
[31:47.52]That's right, I'm gonna do this.
[31:48.34]It's right here.
[31:52.88]Wait, umbrellas!
[31:53.72]I can attack an umbrella?
[31:55.90]Give me that umbrella.
[31:56.64]Hold on, who else has an umbrella?
[32:00.83]You do.
[32:01.59]That's mine now.
[32:05.66]Just let it go.
[32:06.70]Drop the umbrella.
[32:08.18]Let it go!
[32:08.66]Thank you.
[32:13.11]Can I open it?
[32:14.21]How do I open the umbrella?
[32:15.55]And have my own umbrella?
[32:16.77]No?
[32:20.57]Oh, god damn it.
[32:21.13]I can't just open it like a loser.
[32:37.95]It didn't hurt anybody.
[32:40.21]It's essentially a pillow.
[32:42.07]It's a pillow fight.
[32:42.89]That person's fine.
[32:46.69]The blood was... That was not real blood.
[32:52.76]She was eating french fries and got ketchup all over her.
[32:56.68]You wouldn't bleed.
[32:57.42]Wait, what's going on?
[33:07.84]Hold down on D-pad?
[33:08.69]What are you talking about?
[33:09.25]Hold down on D-pad?
[33:09.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[33:10.45]What are you talking about?
[33:11.63]I did hold down on D-pad.
[33:15.71]Hold.
[33:16.79]Guys, holding down on D-pad throws it down.
[33:19.35]Who's this guy that's fucking shit-faced?
[33:20.85]And why was it open when I came off the bike?
[33:22.35]Get the fuck out of here.
[33:25.34]Down on the D-pad throws it on the ground.
[33:27.60]How long have you guys seen this game for?
[33:33.17]We've been playing this game for like 25 hours.
[33:35.69]That means you throw it down.
[33:37.77]Why was it open?
[33:38.51]Hold on.
[33:41.72]When I got off the bike, it was open.
[33:44.54]If I hold down on the D-pad, it throws it on the ground.
[33:49.21]I don't know how much more communicative I have to be about this.
[34:00.56]Stop it.
[34:02.00]It's open now.
[34:03.28]See?
[34:04.12]Everything's fine.
[34:04.88]Fuck, now I can't use it anymore.
[34:10.38]You're not doing it right.
[34:12.76]Leave me alone.
[34:14.70]Leave me alone.
[34:15.16]My hair's gonna look like this in like four years.
[34:17.78]Okay, sorry.
[34:31.16]the grenade launcher.
[34:34.23]I don't even have that because I picked up a fucking umbrella.
[34:40.61]That's my hair now.
[34:41.55]No, it's not.
[34:42.41]What are you talking about?
[34:43.41]No, you're on my team, aren't you?
[34:47.71]No, you're not.
[34:53.57]Oh, well.
[34:56.86]Somebody in the chat said, okay, sorry.
[35:04.04]What is this guy actually mad?
[35:05.98]What are you actually mad?
[35:16.57]I really want that extra melee damage thing.
[35:19.23]Break his legs.
[35:26.17]Sorry.
[35:26.99]Where'd you get the knife?
[35:28.71]Where'd you get that knife?
[35:35.50]Oh my god, I thought you guys were on my team the whole fucking time.
[35:40.56]He got the knife.
[35:41.94]I thought these guys... Why weren't these guys... Whatever.
[35:45.30]Just a little bit of... I don't even think about it.
[35:54.19]I'm gonna fucking lose if I'm not careful here.
[36:03.60]I swept that guy to death.
[36:04.88]Who's left?
[36:05.62]That was a lot.
[36:10.08]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[36:12.16]Damn it.
[36:12.54]What you got?
[36:44.35]Wait, why are you guys doing that?
[36:45.49]Oh, these guys are heavy.
[36:51.62]I couldn't even tell from the way they looked.
[36:56.88]These guys aren't actually heavy.
[36:58.00]They're pretend heavy.
[37:07.85]Get over here.
[37:09.93]In the dumpster, dumpster, dumpster, dumpster, dumpster.
[37:12.71]No!
[37:14.60]There we go.
[37:23.69]I just broke his heart.
[37:27.07]No, I don't mean it like that.
[37:28.16]I mean, you can take it out when you want, but... Well, that hurt.
[37:43.58]It's too late.
[37:44.14]I haven't even got a chance to do the cool stuff yet with this outfit.
[37:50.28]How did you not get hit by that?
[37:54.30]Broke his heart.
[37:57.68]I thought that guy's shirt said Canada.
[38:11.22]Alright.
[38:12.14]Thanks.
[38:13.24]You better lay low.
[38:18.23]Wait, what's going on, man?
[38:19.73]Shit, they're Mrs. Truce.
[38:20.83]They're coming after everything we got.
[38:22.61]Who do these fucks think they are?
[38:24.31]Big Smile Lee's coming after us.
[38:26.03]I guess he figures we can't vote against him if we're dead.
[38:28.38]Big Smile Lee?
[38:29.94]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[38:31.00]You want out?
[38:31.80]No, I'm with you all the way, boss.
[38:35.57]Oh shit, we gotta go!
[38:39.24]We gotta go!
[38:39.98]We gotta go now!
[38:40.98]Right now!
[38:42.20]We gotta go!
[38:43.42]Okay!
[38:46.92]4, 3, 2, 1!
[38:47.52]Fail!
[38:50.32]I wasn't even paying attention!
[38:51.82]They're all dead!
[38:58.65]I was looking at chat!
[38:59.63]I thought the mission was over!
[39:02.63]Oh, great.
[39:05.49]Oh no.
[39:15.69]Late.
[39:16.17]Yeah, he's late.
[39:36.50]I got time.
[39:37.02]Get inside.
[39:37.60]30 seconds.
[39:37.90]We're good.
[39:38.53]One, two, three.
[39:39.01]Come on.
[39:39.23]What does this look like?
[40:19.17]I'm out of ammo.
[40:25.87]I like the sound, this one's powerful.
[40:39.19]Why would I do something like that?
[40:40.67]Why would I do something like that?
[40:41.69]It's not a movie.
[40:49.51]Jeremy, it's not a movie.
[40:50.39]It's a video game.
[40:51.51]There's a difference.
[40:53.54]You know how many takes they get to do?
[40:59.56]Keanu Reeves did that move like 12 times and they took the coolest one.
[41:04.90]There's a word like that in a video game.
[41:06.62]Watch the front.
[41:08.76]I'll go check it out.
[41:11.45]You stupid bitch.
[41:12.77]Where's Wei Shen?
[41:14.37]I got a message for him from Big Smile.
[41:16.67]Easy is difficulty.
[41:17.47]This is not uneasy.
[41:18.19]Just the piece of shit I'm looking for.
[41:20.27]You're going to vote for Li, you hear me?
[41:22.27]You don't, we're gonna fuck you.
[41:24.61]All your ancestors and ancestors.
[41:30.03]It must work.
[41:32.67]These guys don't give a fuck.
[41:40.52]Come on, why are you doing this now?
[41:43.36]Okay, go.
[41:46.83]I didn't even shoot that guy.
[41:48.51]I didn't even go close to shooting that guy.
[41:51.09]That was so stupid.
[42:08.67]He's still missed though, it's okay.
[42:09.75]There's nobody in this car.
[42:10.77]Is that guy dead?
[42:12.89]Yeah.
[42:16.91]That's the second person that I've activated the gun.
[42:20.91]Time to parkour, let's go.
[42:23.38]Meet Conroy on the roof of the Golden Coy.
[42:40.89]What?
[42:41.07]Statues?
[42:43.11]Statues or anything?
[42:44.08]Like, I don't want to miss a statue.
[42:45.30]No.
[42:45.62]They would be on the mini-map.
[42:48.72]That's a pretty big gun.
[43:04.19]I feel like you need three people to use this gun.
[43:06.87]One person to sit on it, one person to hold it with both hands, and the other person to hold the trigger.
[43:12.99]I can run out of bullets though, that's the thing.
[43:27.68]We gonna give this like another minute?
[43:34.54]Okay, I wanna see... Oh, there's ammo in the suitcase.
[43:36.92]Okay.
[43:37.04]I don't even need to use this then.
[43:42.65]Why?
[43:43.63]Oh, I just missed it a bunch of times.
[43:46.73]It's fine.
[43:47.37]Alright, where's the suitcase?
[44:02.79]I just ran off.
[44:05.67]I just ran off the fucking building.
[44:07.58]Alright.
[44:09.02]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[44:16.43]That would have been bad.
[44:31.07]This game's cool.
[44:31.87]It is very cool.
[44:34.33]It's really fun Get away from the cops
[45:02.63]Oh, I just nudged him a little.
[45:05.91]Didn't really help me.
[45:06.59]Yeah, it did.
[45:08.89]Where am I taking you?
[45:10.17]Meet up with Ricky at Vivian's apartment.
[45:13.11]Game's the best.
[45:13.66]It is.
[45:13.92]It's phenomenal.
[45:14.34]They did a very good job.
[45:15.70]You can tell when a game is fun when...
[45:26.58]You stay interested throughout the entire experience.
[45:31.01]There hasn't really been a point in this game where I've said, This is slowing me down.
[45:36.45]I don't like this.
[45:37.59]This is slow.
[45:38.59]What the hell was that?
[45:43.56]It was pointing me into the fence.
[45:46.34]It was giving me literal directions to drive into the fence.
[45:50.68]Where is this taking me?
[45:53.30]What route is this?
[45:58.03]Gonna get you there the quickest way we can.
[46:07.04]Case?
[46:07.36]I don't care.
[46:10.12]We got all the things we need.
[46:12.82]No cases.
[46:13.74]What's happening?
[46:20.38]Screw the case.
[46:20.98]It's gonna have five grand in it.
[46:23.93]The cases aren't really... After like 10-20 hours in the game...
[46:28.83]They become just a thing that you need to collect.
[46:31.03]And 100%.
[46:31.15]They don't really have... They have something more.
[46:34.51]Like a new hat.
[46:35.39]This hat's red.
[46:36.61]This hat's green.
[46:38.15]Eh.
[46:39.77]You see a red envelope, then I will... I will drive over people to get that.
[46:43.04]You know what I mean?
[46:44.28]Blue cases?
[46:46.34]Not really.
[46:54.64]DLC missions?
[46:55.22]We'll see where we are when we're done.
[46:57.39]What's this Life is Strange music?
[47:17.23]Red Avalos versus blue cases.
[47:18.41]Ricky?
[47:47.32]Okay.
[47:47.62]Okay, bye.
[48:24.55]What's next?
[48:25.49]$25,000.
[48:25.63]News clippings.
[48:27.99]And a triad upgrade, which we can do this one.
[48:30.94]Weapon resistant.
[48:33.52]Pretty important.
[48:36.58]What do I have for police upgrades?
[48:41.98]Yeah.
[48:43.01]You wonder why I'm so awful with the guns?
[48:45.99]Because I don't have any of the gun actual talent points.
[48:52.34]better focused ammo, slow motion, recoil, like, this is, I need this shit.
[48:58.36]Eventually.
[49:00.52]Yeah, we got some nail clippings to look at.
[49:02.18]Uh, new case.
[49:06.03]Buried alive.
[49:06.89]I'm using an Xbox controller, and I'm awful.
[49:14.31]Uh, I mean, we're all allowed to have opinions.
[49:17.05]Right?
[49:18.67]Okay.
[49:23.76]You know, I could have opinions, too.
[49:27.65]You might not like them.
[49:29.51]But I have them.
[49:30.09]Let's call these in controller.
[49:35.55]Don't even bring up the controller.
[49:37.11]Nope, don't even bring up the controller again.
[49:40.15]I am willing to go to keyboard and mouse right now, just so we don't have to talk about the fucking Xbox thing again.
[49:46.46]Let me just eat these nail clippings and be done with it, you know?
[50:11.84]Hey!
[50:12.92]I'm merging.
[50:19.21]The fucking controller!
[50:20.67]Wait, I'm gonna get- Just give me the cab.
[50:22.71]Get in the cab.
[50:28.16]Fuck that.
[50:30.84]Excuse me!
[50:40.74]Please take me across the whole game, please Keyboard and mouse is horrible.
[50:52.80]I'm not even driving the car.
[50:54.30]What is this guy going?
[50:58.46]Alright Nice job
[51:05.08]Now, I'm of the opinion that all third-person games that have action and melee and punching, like, a game like, uh, with the Batman-style melee system, I don't, I think it would be hell with a mouse and keyboard.
[51:21.03]Just my opinion.
[51:21.79]We're all gonna have a lot of nerve after that shit Pedro pulled at the funeral.
[51:25.09]What, he sent you to finish the job?
[51:26.59]Pedro doesn't know I'm here, right?
[51:28.59]I'm completely violating protocol.
[51:32.13]I never wanted you for this job because of what Dog Eyes did to your sister and how you handle things in San Francisco.
[51:37.41]But you've done better than anyone could have expected.
[51:39.95]I can only imagine the pressure you must have been under.
[51:42.59]Don't get sappy on me now, Raymond.
[51:44.39]Wait, you crossed Pendry.
[51:46.65]You see how opinions, where opinions come from?
[51:51.05]In the span of two minutes, I looked in the chat, I watched the chat, half of which said Keyboard and Mouse was awful for this game, and half of which said Keyboard and Mouse is great for this game.
[52:00.08]I don't know what he'll do.
[52:02.97]Not anymore.
[52:04.09]Do you understand?
[52:05.39]It's preference.
[52:06.03]Come back with me now, you're a good man.
[52:07.83]We can fix this.
[52:08.89]Smooth it over with Pendry.
[52:14.05]Jackie, not now.
[52:14.77]I'm busy.
[52:15.32]Mr. Shen, we have your friend.
[52:19.46]So listen very carefully.
[52:21.42]You'll receive our instructions from the HR team to leave.
[52:23.66]What's wrong with the draw distance?
[52:26.84]Look, it's Jackie.
[52:27.48]I need to go.
[52:28.52]Wait.
[52:29.62]Wait.
[52:31.92]What about my opinion?
[52:33.74]I haven't even tried keyboard and mouse.
[52:36.97]Okay.
[52:43.39]Okay, that's... Left click is punch.
[52:47.35]Right click is... I'm not even sure.
[52:49.05]I have to get in a fight with somebody.
[52:52.43]What's right click?
[52:56.49]Why is right click not grab?
[52:59.05]Is right click...
[53:02.19]Whew, sloppy!
[53:05.34]What does space do?
[53:09.82]Left shift?
[53:10.78]Left shift is jump and climb?
[53:13.52]Whoa!
[53:15.11]Sloppy!
[53:21.97]So what does grab?
[53:22.67]What does middle mouse button do?
[53:24.63]Middle mouse button ain't bound to anything?
[53:31.63]Alright, so left shift is that.
[53:33.03]Let's keep going.
[53:40.31]F is grab.
[53:42.03]No, it's not.
[53:42.94]Oh boy, that is not what I want.
[53:45.84]F is grab.
[53:48.30]So left click is punch.
[53:50.16]F is grab.
[53:52.10]You realize that A and B are like those things.
[53:55.46]My thumb presses those buttons within two centimeters.
[54:00.30]My left click and F, that's about two feet away from each other.
[54:04.24]Yikes.
[54:11.58]How do you get in cars?
[54:17.70]What is, what is, is it E?
[54:20.95]Yeah, okay.
[54:21.75]E, A, B.
[54:24.99]Yeah, they're two feet away from each other.
[54:26.39]It's like a foot and a half, at least, two feet.
[54:28.11]From my mouse to F on the keyboard.
[54:29.51]To measure it.
[54:34.52]And WASD driving is... I mean, I think everybody can agree.
[54:39.48]Whatever your opinion is on third-person combat, whatever.
[54:42.72]WASD and space for driving?
[54:46.16]Uh-uh.
[54:46.99]Analog all the way.
[54:48.09]Same reason why everybody that I knew that played GTA...
[54:53.84]When they got in a car, they would use the controller.
[54:56.31]When they got in a helicopter... Stop unplugging my controller!
[54:59.73]My opinion is my... I've stated my opinion, Windows!
[55:12.87]When we used to play GTA, you'd switch to the controller to fly the helicopter.
[55:18.82]You'd switch to the controller to do half the tasks.
[55:23.86]Your PC doesn't even want the controller plugged in.
[55:28.67]I will say that I believe that some controllers are superior.
[55:33.57]For instance, I think the PS4 controller is superior to the Xbox controller.
[55:38.61]And now before anybody freaks out and goes, What?
[55:41.95]What did you say?
[55:43.45]There's one reason.
[55:44.17]It's because I like the spacing of the analogs on here, but I don't... I don't like that.
[55:50.75]I don't like how the bumpers make this loud clicking sound.
[55:54.99]When you play Dark Souls, when you play any of the Souls games with an Xbox controller, you hear this in your sleep.
[56:21.53]Does it work?
[56:23.51]Here we go.
[56:31.60]Now yeah, I think keyboard and mouse is the ultimate control scheme.
[56:36.64]But for very specific scenarios, like third-person action games, I think controller is superior.
[56:44.26]That's just what I think.
[56:51.50]And this has been the podcast where we talk about all kinds of controversial topics of what I think.
[56:58.08]On WBZ 1030, man.
[57:03.36]Hold on.
[57:08.82]Did somebody in the chat just say nobody cares?
[57:12.70]You do realize that this has been the point of contention for the last four days.
[57:17.30]What do you mean nobody cares?
[57:20.96]Everybody does, apparently.
[57:22.66]Because it's in the chat every 30 seconds.
[57:33.55]What?
[57:39.33]Dude, nobody cares.
[57:40.50]Why do you keep talking about this?
[57:41.84]Because it's the only thing anybody cares about.
[57:52.08]I'm getting triggered!
[57:54.92]Look, even my character is getting triggered.
[57:56.96]I hate that word.
[57:57.64]I refuse to say it.
[57:58.32]Even though I just did.
[58:04.29]You just made that easier for me.
[58:05.55]Thanks, dude.
[58:08.13]Can I get this guy off me?
[58:12.15]You're not really helping as much as you are causing a problem for everybody else.
[58:17.54]Thanks, man.
[58:27.55]Shrimp versus pizza?
[58:32.65]Well, I think.
[58:34.89]I like shrimp, but only if they take out the vein.
[58:37.35]And a lot of places don't.
[58:41.37]I don't want to eat shrimp shit.
[58:45.17]That's what the vein is.
[58:46.51]That's how they go to the bathroom.
[58:48.19]I need to break this guy up.
[58:55.18]Punch.
[58:55.46]There we go.
[59:02.37]Whoa!
[59:02.69]What was that?
[59:03.17]Wait, you guys didn't know that?
[59:09.07]That vein that goes down the back of the shrimp, that's how they go to the bathroom.
[59:21.09]Just keep blocking him.
[59:26.27]Oh, am I gonna get to cut his face off?
[59:34.33]You're never going to find him!
[59:36.57]Stop!
[59:37.73]Stop!
[59:39.23]Where's Jack?
[59:40.37]I don't know.
[59:40.99]I don't know what they did with him.
[59:42.77]What do you mean you don't know?
[59:44.35]I was just interviewing.
[59:45.57]I don't know anything about the other guy.
[59:49.61]Who does?
[59:50.51]D.Y., Agent K's head enforcer.
[59:54.06]How do I get to him?
[59:55.36]I don't know.
[59:55.94]I only talk to him by phone.
[59:58.66]Tell me, and I might let you live, you stupid fucking... I only talk to him on my phone.
[60:03.26]Dude, stop flailing your arms around.
[60:05.00]That's how you're gonna get cut on your hand.
[60:06.88]Ooh, he's dead.
[60:14.92]Take his spice rack.
[60:31.18]No, guys, don't press F. You'll grab somebody.
[60:39.20]Why would I take this car?
[60:41.57]Alright, this car is...
[61:00.17]Uh, alright.
[61:02.14]For real, that thing was just on fire.
[61:04.40]And then it lit up, it got four... That was just a cool magic trick.
[61:08.62]The wheels lit.
[61:09.64]See, look.
[61:10.20]I'm gonna show you what's something important.
[61:14.04]It's because I opened the door that it exp... No!
[61:15.99]No, no, no, no, no!
[61:16.67]It didn't... No, no, no!
[61:25.79]I didn't think it was gonna blow up unless I opened the car door.
[61:32.02]Alright, here we go.
[61:32.56]Let's locate this thing.
[61:36.55]Hello?
[61:36.95]Hello?
[61:37.35]Hello?
[61:37.73]I didn't die this time, that's true.
[61:40.41]Okay, we got, uh... Alright.
[61:41.61]Confront ZY.
[62:07.01]Running from the car.
[62:08.03]Oh my god, your car sucks.
[62:11.93]I don't even want it.
[62:12.51]Give me my other car.
[62:13.45]Give me no contacts.
[62:17.86]Oh, new phone.
[62:18.40]Who did?
[62:21.32]New phone.
[62:21.64]Who did?
[62:27.33]I don't even need a car.
[62:36.53]I could have already walked.
[62:43.79]No, actually, I'm glad I... Okay, no.
[62:45.95]That's a good thing that I got out of that.
[62:47.11]Because I would have been in that stupid soccer mom van.
[62:53.28]And they would have all gotten away.
[62:56.06]Don't... GPS, please don't tell me to drive down the stairs.
[63:03.69]Be nice.
[63:08.52]Come on, get over here.
[63:10.72]Here we go.
[63:15.23]Goodbye.
[63:17.87]Well, that was risky.
[63:19.05]This is risky, but I'm doing risky.
[63:22.73]One more.
[63:23.87]Should I jump to his car?
[63:25.37]Oh, fuck you.
[63:40.93]Just driving a stupid taxi.
[63:51.06]We're gonna go around the whole damn city like this.
[63:53.10]I already know it.
[63:58.64]Did I defeat him?
[64:05.01]Defeat him.
[64:10.32]Defeat this guy.
[64:20.52]Ah, shit!
[64:21.90]Get outta here!
[64:38.73]Fuck off!
[64:56.14]He's too scared to come over to me.
[64:58.58]It's like bug repellent.
[65:05.94]Alright, give me that lady's purse.
[65:13.24]Give me the purse.
[65:19.83]Alright.
[65:20.17]No!
[65:20.33]Okay, stop fucking around!
[65:22.39]Seriously, I'm done fucking around.
[65:29.23]Come here!
[65:30.71]I can't grab him.
[65:31.59]Oh, fuck.
[65:37.38]I said I was gonna stop fucking around!
[65:39.12]What's going on?
[65:55.46]Salty, this is Wei.
[65:56.62]I need a boat and I need a gun.
[65:58.30]Can you meet me in Kennedy Town?
[65:59.56]This chat is now in joke only mode.
[66:08.16]Sleeping Dogs is so irrelevant it can be played on this channel?
[66:11.14]What are you talking about?
[66:11.94]This game is fucking fantastic!
[66:15.99]What, because the game... Because the game's like four years old, it's irrelevant?
[66:23.51]This game is fucking unbelievable.
[66:25.84]This is one of the best games I've played in a long fucking time.
[66:52.11]Why did you tell me to get on the highway here?
[67:16.66]That fucking hurt a lot.
[67:17.90]Who am I saying thanks to?
[67:21.02]Who am I talking to?
[67:23.82]Who am I talking to?
[67:25.54]Go to Magazine Island.
[67:33.59]Oh no, this is not going to be fun.
[67:39.19]I can't shoot their tires.
[67:40.03]They don't do the thing where they pop in the air.
[67:54.13]Why is that guy jumping out of the boat?
[68:05.32]They're gone.
[68:12.58]Why are you doing that?
[68:18.13]Why would you jump out of the boat?
[68:21.38]Why are you doing this?
[68:25.58]That seems pretty stupid.
[68:28.08]Not gonna lie.
[68:28.85]I think you probably should stay in the boat.
[68:34.79]It's your best chance of survival.
[68:42.67]Okay, so the- Wait a minute, where did he come from?
[68:46.01]A flying Dutchman came over to get us.
[68:52.21]Oh, watch out for these guys, I wonder what they're gonna do.
[68:56.95]I wonder if they're gonna jump out of their boats.
[69:05.46]Fucking stupid people.
[69:06.14]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[69:13.81]I got to the island.
[69:17.72]What was the difference?
[69:18.40]I got to the island.
[69:19.16]Why did the mission fail?
[69:31.33]I love that so much.
[69:32.85]I like that more than I should.
[69:43.21]Oh, what about these guys?
[69:45.02]Those guys are backing up.
[69:48.38]This game does not know what to do about people in these places.
[69:53.84]Where am I going?
[69:55.44]Where's my marker?
[69:59.28]What happened to my marker?
[70:05.47]I don't have a marker anymore.
[70:11.89]Just have to drive to this island, right?
[70:37.41]The same guy.
[70:38.79]Okay, there it is.
[70:43.35]Stop it.
[70:47.51]That's not nice.
[70:48.37]Where are they going?
[70:51.91]They are going very fast.
[70:53.27]They are screwing past this fucking screen.
[71:02.72]What?
[71:07.28]I don't fucking care about the game right now.
[71:08.60]This is more important.
[71:09.52]Where is he going?
[71:10.10]He's gonna hit the invisible wall, right?
[71:37.41]I need to see how this plays out.
[71:38.73]Okay, he's hitting the industrial wall.
[71:42.35]And now what?
[71:44.93]Is this even the same guy?
[71:52.78]It's not even the same fucking guy.
[71:55.42]The mission's not gonna fail.
[72:23.00]Wasting time?
[72:23.72]You didn't want to see what the fuck that could have been?
[72:31.03]That could have been a journey to another land.
[73:04.22]Jacky!
[73:07.42]Jacky!
[73:08.18]Jacky, shit!
[73:09.20]Oh, fuck!
[73:09.88]Oh, fuck, man!
[73:11.18]You're alive!
[73:11.66]That's how I fucking cried!
[73:13.56]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
[73:15.20]You're okay!
[73:15.76]Fuck, fuck, man, fuck!
[73:17.94]Oh, man!
[73:18.56]Calm down.
[73:21.18]I'm right here, brother.
[73:21.88]I thought I was gonna fucking die down there, man.
[73:26.13]Fuck!
[73:27.68]Back to the docks.
[73:55.96]Toss me off to ATK, man.
[73:57.18]Yeah, they'll use you to get me into an ambush.
[74:02.96]Big smile, Lee.
[74:04.64]The fuck is worth the dog eyes, man?
[74:07.20]Fuck.
[74:08.90]Here, Jack.
[74:09.44]Come to the lecture.
[74:11.20]Tell the others what happened.
[74:12.54]That'll be the end of Lee.
[74:13.89]Man, I don't want anything to do with any of this shit.
[74:17.75]Alright.
[74:19.19]Sun On Yee, Broken Nose, Lee, I'm done with all them, man!
[74:22.67]You can dream about beating the Sun On Yee, you know?
[74:25.62]So what do you want to do now, Jackie?
[74:35.90]The election's tomorrow.
[74:37.06]We want to check out the building, make sure that Big Smile Lee isn't planning any surprises.
[74:40.48]But we got some time to kill.
[74:41.54]I don't know.
[74:43.27]I almost bought it today, man.
[74:46.53]For real.
[74:49.10]I think I'm just gonna go take a walk or something.
[74:52.69]Got some shit to think about.
[74:54.53]Sure, man.
[74:55.43]That's cool.
[74:57.27]I'll see you tomorrow or something.
[74:59.07]Alright.
[74:59.57]Don't do anything stupid.
[75:09.76]No, no, no.
[75:10.64]Not cool.
[75:13.58]I need to do a cop mission, man.
[75:15.78]I gotta get at least one or two points.
[75:28.89]Uh, I probably have to go to sleep.
[75:33.45]Maybe.
[75:34.27]Yes.
[75:40.47]Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[75:47.73]Um, what do I have for a car right now?
[75:51.14]Oh, it's the police van.
[75:53.08]This is gonna be bad.
[76:04.64]It's the giant police van.
[76:08.07]Fuck.
[76:12.43]I forgot we had this on.
[76:13.65]Thank you.
[76:38.41]Can you kill that guy?
[76:39.39]No.
[76:41.29]I mean, he can, but he comes back.
[76:47.21]He always comes back.
[76:49.66]Or there's just a shipload.
[76:50.64]They all work in the same house.
[77:07.79]Hmm.
[77:08.60]The case right here I'm gonna get it Get over that there that took a little bit of extra time
[77:38.03]Why did that hurt?
[77:38.85]Can I do anything with you?
[77:43.91]No.

[77:45.02]Come on.

[78:17.17]Nope.
[78:18.05]Twenty grand.

[78:22.35]Actually, that's not bad.
[78:23.35]That's pretty good.
[78:25.71]I'm okay with this.
[78:31.84]Alright, this is a sprained ankle.
[78:34.60]You'll get over it.
[78:35.16]What about the car?
[78:35.72]What's this car thing?
[78:46.94]New glow.
[78:48.10]It's right here.

[78:52.08]20 grand worth of clothes.

[78:59.65]Fuck the police van.
[79:00.55]It's so slow.
[79:03.11]I want to be zooming around town.
[79:13.82]This mission was interesting.
[79:14.96]I get a zoom-in car now.
[79:15.70]What's the goal here?
[79:46.15]Alright.
[79:47.11]Hold A to charge the EMP and fire.
[79:48.69]Wait, I got like a fucking radar gun?
[80:11.60]Released fire.
[80:12.94]Are you serious?
[80:19.21]Oh, okay, that's better.
[80:22.85]Okay, you just go boom.
[80:26.91]Oh, that didn't do anything to you.
[80:32.14]Get out of my fucking way.
[80:33.12]That car's already on fucking fire.
[80:34.88]Come on.
[80:46.67]Don't take any turns.
[80:48.33]Please, don't take any turns.
[80:49.69]He's gonna take this turn.
[80:51.46]Oh, shit!
[80:51.90]Where is he?
[80:59.58]Alright, they're dead.
[81:04.35]Hooray!
[81:20.24]Clench it!
[81:31.58]Sneak.
[81:32.26]And there we go.
[81:36.95]Wow.
[81:37.39]We had a random spawn.
[81:40.17]Two random spawns.
[81:41.55]And that's what... Look it up.
[81:43.59]I might have to crush them.
[81:47.97]It's possible.
[81:54.89]That's it, right?
[81:55.49]No more random spawns?
[81:56.27]There we go.
[82:03.56]And the garage is right here.
[82:06.66]I call that a success.
[82:14.82]So what do you get for doing these?
[82:17.48]Exactly.
[82:18.12]Face?
[82:19.78]Well, you get the EMP upgrades.
[82:22.39]This is where you get all the car upgrades.
[82:24.61]Interesting.
[82:25.07]Alright, time for bed.
[82:37.37]That's pretty cool.
[82:39.45]You get the most amazing car.
[82:42.11]Yeah, a car that can go- Does it hurt people?
[82:44.64]Or am I just annoying?
[82:47.64]I blew that guy's cigarette out.
[82:54.02]Aw, you dick.
[82:55.95]This guy wanted to fight for a second, and then he decided not to.
[83:08.34]I am just being annoying.
[83:09.28]Oh, cop, cop, cop!
[83:12.76]See, this guy wants to fight.
[83:21.45]Let's see, what's he got?
[83:23.97]He's fucking really sloppy.
[83:38.19]Still good?
[83:39.87]Still good?
[83:40.25]No, he still wants to go.
[83:41.33]He throws random haymakers.
[83:42.47]He's done?
[83:44.52]Okay, he's done.
[83:48.34]This car unlocked something else, too.
[83:55.86]He might have closed.
[84:11.48]That's the most terrifying thing in the world.
[84:14.02]Imagine you looked out your window and outside your front door was a car doing that.
[84:20.08]You'd be like, uh, I don't know if I want to even call the police.
[84:24.20]Alright, let's go to bed.
[84:38.47]or pre-recorded.
[84:39.29]I don't think I can even open the door wide enough.
[84:42.05]What are you calling me?
[84:50.31]Wait, come and meet me.
[84:51.11]I have something to show you.
[84:53.77]Car on bed.
[84:54.75]I can't get a car on the bed.
[84:59.39]Oh, you're still here.
[85:00.77]Thought you tired yourself out last night.
[85:03.72]Oh god, fucking dammit guys, really.
[85:09.73]What's wrong with the doors?
[85:24.57]I think if I go a certain distance away, the doors just close.
[85:29.09]I can't even fucking get in this car.
[85:33.44]What's wrong with the car?
[85:35.16]Are you kidding me?
[85:38.00]Can I climb back in the front?
[85:40.44]Why?
[85:40.92]Fuck you, game.
[85:43.11]What the hell?
[85:45.37]Give me something.
[85:45.97]I can get this fucking little dumb thing in there.
[85:55.33]There we go, alright.
[85:56.45]Car on bed or pre-recorded, they say.
[86:04.05]Now I can't get in the fucking house.
[86:11.55]Right here.
[86:17.13]If this closes... Fucking god.
[86:26.14]That was so fast.
[86:28.68]I'm gone.
[86:29.68]See you later.
[86:31.20]We're going to...
[86:32.97]We're going to the election.
[86:41.82]I'm so angry.
[86:42.76]I did that so angrily.
[86:47.48]So it is pre-recorded.
[86:49.41]Hey.
[86:54.31]Watch it.
[86:59.96]I mean, not gonna lie, that license plate is not really that bad of a password.
[87:05.67]I mean, if you added, like, canoe to the end of that, you'd have the most, you'd have a really good secure password.
[87:29.84]He set his password on stream.
[87:35.50]Why did I go this way?
[87:36.50]There's no reason for you to go this way.
[87:39.58]I just caused myself all kinds of unneeded stress.
[87:44.28]Could have gone that secret shortcut too.
[87:45.66]It's alright, I'm just running up the lollipops.
[87:50.99]They can be replaced with cheap.
[88:12.51]Really, the one thing I turned into was a pole.
[88:15.25]Couldn't have been a person.
[88:15.99]Am I faster?
[88:20.61]It's 985 canoe.
[88:22.07]Hold on, what is it?
[88:30.56]Oh, it's this thing.
[88:32.88]It's the sandwich.
[88:33.52]Oh.
[88:41.63]I still can't drift on the left side after 25 hours.
[88:44.83]Yeah, I know.
[88:45.75]And you know why that is?
[88:46.63]Because I can't drive in China.
[88:51.77]This is going against everything I've ever learned in my life.
[88:59.92]For fuck's sake.
[89:10.79]Dab?
[89:14.65]What is with you guys today?
[89:15.85]Have you been, like, snorting kitty litter again?
[89:24.40]Jackie.
[89:27.72]Jackie?
[89:31.08]Yes.
[89:32.89]The fuck?
[89:34.83]Oh!
[89:34.91]Oh, fuck.
[89:36.11]Whoa, that's my friend.
[89:37.31]Oh, my God.
[89:38.03]Jackie.
[89:39.85]Fuck.
[89:41.27]Jackie.
[89:42.31]Fuck.
[89:46.07]Motherfucker!
[89:49.04]No, Mr. Shen.
[89:58.26]Or should I say... Officer Shen.
[90:03.93]My name is Mr. Tom.
[90:06.51]Perhaps you heard of me?
[90:07.83]Fuck you!
[90:08.75]I'm no cop!
[90:11.59]Your friend Jackie didn't think so.
[90:14.05]He was most loyal.
[90:15.59]But then, I expect you wouldn't have told him anything.
[90:19.18]Who is this guy?
[90:21.22]You must be a very dangerous man, Wei Shen.
[90:30.26]Son of a bitch, I'll kill you.
[90:31.96]Save your energy, Mr. Shen.
[90:34.36]You need it.
[90:35.84]The last cup I had in this chair lasted almost 48 hours.
[90:40.56]Would you like to try for a new record?
[90:43.15]I understand your personal reasons for doing this, your history with the son on Yi.
[90:47.55]You do what must be done.
[90:49.91]There were rumors.
[90:51.23]Before I'm done with you, you will confirm them.
[90:55.20]And then you will die.
[90:59.78]That's what worries me, Wei.
[91:00.88]Right after I hammer in this nail.
[91:04.42]Right after I build this crib.
[91:07.88]There's the comedy there.
[91:09.54]I wish, you know, it was great.
[91:17.16]The whole time he's freaking out.
[91:18.36]He pans back and he's just built him a giant cage around him.
[91:22.00]I wanted to make sure I kept you secure.
[91:28.53]You're my prisoner now.
[91:39.11]Don't worry, I'm gonna get up and get that hammer.
[91:51.12]Nope.
[91:54.63]I'm five and just got here.
[91:55.85]What's all the red stuff?
[91:59.27]It's... We're just painting.
[92:03.63]Okay, let me... Do me a favor, guys.
[92:04.89]Take a look at this scene right now and...
[92:08.05]Uh, murder scene or art studio?
[92:12.53]If you got a picture of this, could you tell the difference?
[92:15.94]No, I couldn't.
[92:35.44]This guy is not going to do anything about this.
[92:37.46]He's just right here.
[92:41.30]The blood?
[92:41.72]No, this could be paint.
[92:44.08]This is a studio, man.
[92:46.11]Oh, I'm back on the ground.
[92:57.09]That was very clever.
[93:00.15]See, I would have just started biting them.
[93:02.26]But you can find some things in the environment to swing around somebody's neck.
[93:05.56]By all means, you do you.
[93:07.80]My teeth would have been eight inches deep into that guy's body.
[93:12.44]Nobody expects the bite, you know what I mean?
[93:14.50]Nobody expects you to literally bite them like a goddamn rabid dog.
[93:27.65]Yeah, have you seen these?
[93:29.63]Seen these things?
[93:46.97]God dammit, I thought I could piss.
[93:48.03]I can't even swing.
[93:59.69]Can I do anything else besides this?
[94:09.58]Bottle?
[94:12.46]That's better.
[94:12.92]Holy, what a dehydrated piss you have, man.
[94:22.77]I can't grab either.
[94:23.53]I can only counter and punch.
[94:27.05]Actually, I can only counter.
[94:32.23]That's not a... Dude, that's a lot of piss.
[94:33.59]That's also this sediment in there.
[94:36.86]That is a rotten piss.
[94:38.00]I'm supposed to grab him.
[94:50.93]Grab him.
[94:52.19]Oh, you mean from behind.
[94:53.05]Well, whatever.
[94:53.47]I didn't... I think I have my strength now.
[95:10.08]Call Tom!
[95:17.16]Chef?
[95:17.50]No?
[95:17.80]Anything I can do?
[95:18.46]Anything I can pick up here?
[95:19.90]Face burn.
[95:20.36]In the fridge?
[95:21.62]Awww, that was brutal.
[95:33.92]And the thing is, that probably wouldn't even hurt that much, because the Freezer is not that heavy.
[95:38.08]But that was still pretty cool.
[95:41.22]There we go.
[95:50.59]See ya.
[95:54.97]Nope, don't think so, buddy.
[95:58.11]I will stop you every time.
[95:59.77]That's it.
[96:02.49]Nope.
[96:03.86]You are still alive.
[96:06.17]I can't seem to grab you on the stairs.
[96:07.55]I don't know what happened, but he got hurt.
[96:13.47]Table saw, table saw, table saw.
[96:14.93]You got it.
[96:18.94]Holy shit.
[96:20.60]Into the TV?
[96:32.16]That was sensational.
[96:35.78]Two!
[96:37.20]That's a PVC pipe.
[96:38.52]It's not a fucking spike.
[96:43.06]Let's be real.
[96:45.03]What else is in here?
[96:46.11]Over here?
[96:46.45]In the elevator?
[96:48.03]Alright, the wall ate him.
[96:58.00]Wait, cases!
[96:59.60]No, nothing.
[97:07.36]I gotta keep my eye out for cases and statues.
[97:13.39]What do I do?
[97:17.07]What do I do?
[97:19.17]Nothing.
[97:24.03]Oh, fuck.
[97:28.87]Case on map.
[97:29.57]Yeah, I see it up there.
[97:31.09]What do you got?
[97:35.27]Electricity?
[97:35.97]Yeah, this is the electricity of this dude's head.
[97:49.24]Nothing on the map.
[97:50.94]It's back there somewhere.
[97:55.39]No, heavy guy.
[97:56.99]Heavy guy.
[98:05.60]Here.
[98:07.42]What are they making, bacon?
[98:10.73]They got hamburgers and bacon on here.
[98:12.19]Shit.
[98:29.59]Other side.
[98:31.77]Human barbecue, that's right.
[98:39.57]Break it.
[98:40.81]I'll just back crunch.
[98:50.61]Goodbye.
[98:52.38]No, really?
[98:55.26]Now he'll go off, right?
[99:02.29]Aww, I want to watch him the whole way down.
[99:04.05]That's not cool.
[99:07.07]He crudged himself.
[99:21.44]Should have paid more attention.
[99:23.44]Stupid!
[99:23.86]Case.
[99:31.81]No.
[99:32.63]It's like all... I don't even know if it's on this building.
[99:41.59]Uh-huh.
[99:45.35]Toggle the fl... Oh, shit.
[99:46.94]Light.
[99:47.28]Flashlight.
[99:48.04]Okay.
[99:50.00]Oh, what?
[100:10.01]This guy, this guy's freaking me out.
[100:16.03]Huh?
[100:19.60]Oh, you can see me.
[100:20.68]What are you doing?
[100:26.76]You dead?
[100:32.25]Jump over the boxes and do something cool.
[100:34.03]Why are you not jumping over the boxes?
[100:43.95]reminded me of.
[100:44.57]Remember those old montages that people that were like young teenagers, like 10, 12, 13 years old, you'd upload a montage of like a kill montage.
[100:56.53]And it was like, with loud music in the background.
[101:02.65]And like they were practicing their editing.
[101:06.75]So it's alright.
[101:07.24]They're not a big deal.
[101:25.57]I got plenty of bullets, right?
[101:26.57]Yeah.
[101:29.75]Can I fall?
[101:32.58]Maybe.
[101:33.22]I don't want to know.
[101:37.50]Nice.
[101:46.33]Oh, that's a lot of noise at the same time.
[101:47.89]I don't know if I want this gun.
[101:50.43]Yeah, I want this one.
[101:51.79]I like this one better.
[101:52.75]It's easier.
[102:10.14]I just got destroyed.
[102:14.86]Not one bullet.
[102:15.68]Alright, well that's fine.
[102:17.20]Fucking flashlight.
[102:23.59]Relax.
[102:26.27]I'm shooting the fucking lockers like a dumbass.
[102:47.04]Turn off the lights.
[102:52.22]Okay, I guess head turned around backwards.
[103:12.81]Statue?
[103:15.09]What do you mean statue?
[103:15.79]Where?
[103:16.07]I don't see a statue.
[103:24.04]Alright, we need to take this gun.
[103:28.40]Yep, thank you.
[103:41.15]Now give me the shotgun back.
[103:42.49]Missing a case?
[103:44.78]I don't believe you.
[103:45.28]I mean, I see, I know the case is on the mini-map, but it ain't here.
[103:50.48]Back into the elevator?
[103:53.54]That's not true.
[103:54.46]No, no, no, no.
[103:55.52]I'm not gonna listen.
[103:57.23]You can't get me to listen.
[104:00.03]I am gonna be a toddler and not listen to any of you.
[104:19.17]Another explosion maybe I could do?
[104:24.77]Maybe.
[104:26.49]Mm-hmm.
[104:29.06]Blow up.
[104:35.44]He's not going to blow up.
[104:36.74]Okay, I tried.
[104:44.35]I'm just done.
[104:45.89]Unbelievable.
[104:53.50]My bullets are just going through it for some reason.
[104:55.10]I don't know what that's all about, but... I need a soda right now.
[105:10.33]Give me a soda.
[105:13.09]Guess I can't drink a soda fine by me I'm gonna tattoo that on my body
[105:46.48]Get off me, dude!
[105:53.06]Get off me, bro!
[105:53.86]Alright, shut up and just play.
[105:59.36]I can't burn?
[105:59.84]Yes, I can.
[106:00.78]There's hot coals here for a reason.
[106:04.43]Trip.
[106:10.29]Knee in the face, knee in the chin.
[106:34.23]Show them what we've learned.
[106:42.26]That's what we've learned.
[106:47.46]I suppose I should be impressed.
[106:50.14]Is this the guy with the tools?
[106:51.53]You're defeating my men like that.
[106:55.49]I am not.
[106:56.81]What's your favorite documentary?
[106:58.23]Supersize me on times eight speed.
[107:00.21]Now.
[107:06.50]He kind of inflates in front of you on camera.
[107:08.66]There's definitely not something to say to someone who's kicking your ass.
[107:37.93]You're never gonna win.
[107:43.51]Ow!
[107:44.51]Holy shit, this hurts over and over again.
[107:46.74]You're never gonna win.
[108:07.07]Meet me when you are done with Shen.
[108:16.22]Alright, I don't want to lose this.
[108:18.16]This thing is huge and exciting.
[108:37.07]Level 9.
[108:39.42]I've got... What do I got now?
[108:41.86]Counter Recovery.
[108:43.80]Wave recovers faster from a failed counter attempt.
[108:46.20]Oh, that's actually really good.
[108:47.32]I want that.
[108:54.39]Take Mr. Wong's... Mr. Tong's car.
[108:57.17]I just... They're within three letters.
[109:01.53]Holy God.
[109:05.39]Are they dead?
[109:11.75]I'm so flabbergasted.
[109:13.47]Oh my god, this is brutal.
[109:21.79]I'm gonna drop this if I get in the car, right?
[109:25.86]Shouldn't.
[109:26.18]I'll see it on the ground.
[109:32.32]Case!
[109:36.58]Case.
[109:38.00]Get out of- I can't get out of the car.
[109:43.54]I'm locked in the car.
[109:49.05]I can't get out of the car.
[109:53.53]Oh, Fastback!
[109:55.63]10% cashback on every purchase!
[110:02.54]There's a case.
[110:05.44]There's a case.
[110:12.73]You are an officer of the law, same as me.
[110:17.39]Wait, if you have a problem with me, then let's sort it out ourselves, okay?
[110:20.73]We don't need to bring her into this.
[110:26.45]I love how this car has a great TV turn-on whine.
[110:35.04]I hate when TVs do this.
[110:37.70]I think you've heard a big smiley.
[110:40.73]Oh, I don't even want to hit or accelerate.
[110:42.07]It's playing special music?
[111:20.62]I thought that was part of the song.
[111:27.92]It sounded like it went to the music.
[111:36.10]I was like what a special song.
[111:39.72]No matter what happens, Jacky, I won't leave you behind.
[111:42.16]I'll always come back to you.
[111:43.38]You were my best friend, man.
[111:48.34]That means more than a boss, you know?
[111:52.20]Your friend, Jacky, didn't think so.
[111:54.72]He was most loyal.
[111:55.86]I am the universal state, but this cannot be of indebted.
[112:09.05]Okay, I can get out now.
[112:17.66]Do we still need the songs on?
[112:25.31]Case.
[112:36.96]Holy shit.
[112:44.60]This thing is so perfect.
[112:45.34]I don't want to lose it.
[112:53.38]I love this thing so much.
[112:54.36]I don't want to get rid of it.
[112:59.90]Damn, my knife is bigger, dude.
[113:04.20]I got a long way to go.
[113:16.35]That guy, I wouldn't even aim for that guy.
[113:17.77]We're not getting rid of this yet.
[113:22.71]Where's that case?
[113:25.25]Is it in there?
[113:31.00]Come on, I think, I think I have to go in that door.
[113:41.94]Where's this case?
[113:42.64]Stop.
[113:46.10]Fuck the cases.
[113:52.03]Oh, there it is.
[113:52.99]Found the case.
[113:56.73]What the fuck is it?
[114:02.70]Useless.
[114:07.89]Okay, I gotta turn this down.
[114:14.14]I'm gonna 1, 2, 1, 2, 3.
[114:18.89]Music, whatever.
[114:19.49]You guys, if you guys really want to hear the music that bad, just open up a YouTube video with the OST.
[114:24.71]In fact, an OST, Sleeping Dogs.
[114:28.12]0, 6, 7.
[114:31.44]What a time to be alive is the name of the track.
[114:47.53]I need them.
[114:49.94]Alright, got a knife.
[114:51.42]First person.
[114:52.14]Literally the first person.
[114:54.44]Whatever the first person says, yes or no.
[114:55.82]Keep the, keep the, yes, keep the knife, or no.
[114:58.22]Well, I threw it, so we're gonna, we're gonna fucking kill.
[115:02.93]I hit right trigger.
[115:05.39]Okay, I saw a knife.
[115:13.58]No, well, this is not gonna be possible.
[115:29.52]Okay, we're not using it.
[115:35.32]Knife or no balls?
[115:36.86]Oh, please.
[115:38.30]Please.
[115:39.73]Don't make me do this.
[115:42.05]Fine, I'll do it.
[115:42.69]I can do this.
[115:46.09]I'm confident I know how to do this.
[115:47.91]What the fuck are you doing, Jeremy?
[115:50.55]You stupid butthead.
[115:52.21]Gump idiot.
[115:55.22]There are way worse things I could scream at myself right now.
[116:09.02]Okay.
[116:10.64]Alright, we're doing the knife, fine.
[116:11.92]I just have to make it happen.
[116:24.10]I was- I was locking onto it.
[116:26.65]Hey, where's that gun?
[116:27.37]Where'd that gun go?
[116:31.93]I was locked on, and it didn't- It's alright, we'll be fine.
[116:48.87]clumsy oh boy oh boy holy shit shoot the gun shoot the gun what the hell was that
[117:19.03]No balls.
[117:21.15]It's alright.
[117:21.71]You don't even need them.
[117:25.52]You can get through life with a shaft.
[117:26.94]You're gonna be fine.
[117:28.96]I'm sorry.
[117:30.00]I'm sorry to all the people.
[117:32.74]I'm sorry to all the people!
[117:34.98]See, I've already apologized.
[117:36.37]Now you have to forget about it.
[117:37.39]By the way, there's the case.
[118:00.48]Just seeing what the images were.
[118:03.64]Beat the thugs.
[118:07.74]Any grenades or anything?
[118:09.34]Oh, it wants me to do this cool slow motion thing here.
[118:11.22]Okay.
[118:17.36]Alright, I'll try that again.
[118:23.02]What's wrong with you?
[118:24.62]Can you not do an action fucking sequence?
[118:27.92]What's wrong with you?
[118:29.00]Why are you doing this?
[118:33.07]Alright, okay.
[118:35.21]So, we're gonna do that again.
[118:37.93]Slow motion.
[118:45.85]Why are you putting your hands up?
[119:00.09]Needs a moving.
[119:00.87]Ah, controller!
[119:29.78]Where are they?
[119:35.02]Guy behind the haystack.
[119:37.22]Right there.
[119:38.14]Well, there's two guys behind the haystack, apparently.
[119:43.02]No, there's not.
[119:44.10]There's only one guy behind.
[119:45.40]There.
[119:47.14]Where are you?
[119:47.90]He's gonna pop up.
[119:48.92]Doesn't even matter if he pops up, because he's dead.
[119:57.86]I like the auto shotgun.
[119:58.74]It's fun.
[120:00.55]Although, let me get the... Where is this thing?
[120:03.85]There's a case up there.
[120:06.85]There's health around there.
[120:08.51]No, that's too late.
[120:09.75]It's too late.
[120:15.83]What's under the truck?
[120:20.46]It's Mew under the truck.
[120:22.10]What do you mean Mew?
[120:29.01]I don't understand what you're talking about.
[120:30.17]Mew?
[120:33.57]Is that like a weapon?
[120:44.20]Mew under truck.
[120:45.52]You're making like a Pokémon reference.
[120:49.86]I don't know what you mean by that, but okay.
[120:54.79]Oh, here's the worst possible weapon.
[120:58.13]Alright, they're getting... Okay, go go go.
[121:06.93]Yeah, sorry.
[121:07.33]Go on.
[121:08.03]You're free.
[121:13.10]Don't sprint at me, okay?
[121:14.44]Like, we're doing a giant encounter where a bunch of people are shooting at me.
[121:17.32]Don't run at me.
[121:23.46]Move the hands.
[121:25.54]You know what I'm saying?
[121:32.47]He's still alive.
[121:35.42]I was hiding?
[121:37.90]You don't think they can see this or hear this from outside?
[121:41.20]In this situation, my hands are both straight in the air and I'm going... INNOCENT!
[121:44.90]INNOCENT!
[121:45.26]INNOCENT!
[121:45.82]INNOCENT!
[121:46.26]INNOCENT!
[121:46.68]INNOCENT!
[121:47.08]Until I fucking run away.
[121:48.15]I'm on your team!
[121:51.41]I'm on your team!
[121:52.29]Is what I'd be saying.
[121:53.61]He's not doing it right.
[121:56.91]You sound like a prayer.
[121:58.25]You gotta say like, I'm on your team!
[122:00.00]Really loudly.
[122:03.62]$10,000 is not very much.
[122:04.72]These are all the... all the bad guys.
[122:15.19]The guy with the ponytail.
[122:17.07]I'm gonna kill ponytail.
[122:19.59]Alright.
[122:21.77]Okay.
[122:22.83]Let's make this quick.
[122:31.07]I didn't have to do anything.
[122:31.79]You guys are fucking shooting yourselves.
[122:42.82]Fuck!
[122:46.74]I made it pretty far.
[122:47.55]Hold on, I'll get there.
[123:01.16]What?
[123:04.03]Where's the other guy?
[123:07.65]Where's this other guy?
[123:08.23]Fuck!
[123:16.02]Alright, let's just go.
[123:16.80]Let's do it.
[123:17.22]How many more Jex tokens left?
[123:27.78]Let me see if I have any more Jex tokens left.
[123:32.72]That's just an empty can.
[123:36.24]Ow.
[123:39.36]Look at the cases right there.
[123:54.17]I gotta look to my couch cushions.
[124:08.40]I got him.
[124:08.94]You stood a little too close to that, man.
[124:13.72]That guy, I thought he was gonna be harder to kill than that.
[124:20.44]He's gonna shoot the pizza bombs.
[124:40.23]I'll keep this guy.
[124:55.81]And then the game switches right now, zooms into his perspective, you control him now.
[125:00.17]You do the whole rest of the game in reverse.
[125:15.86]Wait, didn't we already do this?
[125:17.44]This was like the beginning of the game, right?
[125:20.28]I'm getting deja vu.
[125:24.65]This did already happen.
[125:29.47]Wait, we actually did do the whole game in reverse.
[125:32.99]Oh, so I was right.
[125:35.77]Okay.
[125:45.90]Ooh, alright.
[125:50.38]Does he not know I'm on here?
[125:58.29]That's a smart move.
[125:59.13]Please tell me we're going to have an in-the-water fight.
[126:11.73]No?
[126:14.01]That'd be fun.
[126:14.61]Just going back and forth, trying to drown each other.
[126:17.07]There's the final fight.
[126:38.06]Probably not.
[126:38.56]One of them.
[126:41.30]You pussy!
[126:45.34]I learned a lot of moves.
[126:48.84]You're done!
[126:51.12]Piece of fucking shit.
[126:56.99]Fuck!
[126:57.59]Everyone always drags this out.
[127:00.59]To know that your boss sold you out.
[127:08.76]You know, you could get all of the stuff you want to say out.
[127:14.96]Don't shoot him in the head.
[127:16.67]Shoot him, like, four times.
[127:18.41]Like, stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach, stomach.
[127:21.07]And then talk to me.
[127:23.65]There'll be enough time.
[127:24.31]See?
[127:24.39]Like, what are you doing?
[127:28.87]There'll be enough time for you to say whatever the fuck you want to say.
[127:34.66]I'm like... I'm in pain right now.
[127:39.14]I'm gonna throw him with a fire.
[127:45.17]Use the fire, come on.
[127:46.17]Oh, wait a minute.
[127:49.75]See?
[128:05.32]No.
[128:05.54]That doesn't matter.
[128:17.21]Defeat?
[128:18.81]Oh, no!
[128:19.23]Defeat him!
[128:19.81]Defeat him!
[128:20.17]Defeat him!
[128:23.11]Great view of the action.
[128:24.39]The climax moment.
[128:26.63]Inside the box.
[128:30.53]Rove into the ice chipper.
[128:32.85]Are you serious?
[128:34.75]We get to turn him into ice cream?
[128:36.53]Holy shit.
[128:45.49]Oh my god.
[128:55.31]I think we did it.
[128:57.87]Did we beat the game?
[128:59.29]Is the game over?
[129:17.30]now eat the ice cream Raymond hey easy their way this man is in my custody yes sir you okay yeah where's pendrew he's up for promotion interpol he's done with us

[129:41.23]Take it from me, Wei.
[129:42.61]Whatever you heard, it won't matter.
[129:44.51]The only voice they hear is Pendrew's.
[129:46.35]So what, Pendrew's the big bad guy?
[129:47.27]You did what you came here to do, alright?
[129:50.69]Let's get you cleaned up.
[129:59.24]So this sets us up for Sleeping Dogs 2.
[130:01.58]The game that got canceled.
[130:19.66]J?
[130:20.84]The fuck?
[130:26.18]Tutorial is done.
[130:27.40]Tutorial.
[130:29.28]Me.
[130:44.00]Uncle Poe?
[130:44.90]Pendulum?
[130:45.94]What the hell?
[130:48.80]Yeah, what the hell?
[130:49.52]Superintendent Pendrew, I'm surprised to see you.
[130:54.62]You're the one who chased my boys away?
[130:57.27]Poe, you know why I'm here.
[130:59.81]I can imagine all sorts of reasons.
[131:03.27]I'm sure you will tell me.
[131:05.09]I'm moving on to greener pastures, but not without taking care of some unfinished business with you and Sonny first.
[131:11.85]We had a deal, did we not, Pendrew?
[131:15.19]I gave you the three tigers.
[131:17.40]It made your career.
[131:18.68]And I let you and Sonny continue operating.
[131:21.20]A sacrifice you were willing to make.
[131:23.06]At the time.
[131:24.96]I'm putting Sonny away, and with you gone, I'll finish this once and for all.
[131:35.06]The only difference between you and me is... Say it.
[131:41.54]Get it out.
[131:42.02]I know...
[131:45.29]What I am No, I'm just fucking with you it's just saline you'll be fine hey nice working with you Jesus Christ pendulum I've got you you son of a bitch Wait what
[132:18.33]I truly am a sleeping dog.
[132:20.96]What the fuck?
[132:23.12]What would you like me to say?
[132:27.18]Why did you do it?
[132:28.04]Whatever I did, I made Hong Kong a better place.
[132:32.07]I served the greater good.
[132:34.85]But you, you let them get to you.
[132:39.55]You abandoned your duty, officer, and became one of them.
[132:44.40]You deserve to be handed over to Big Smile Lee.
[132:47.34]Did I?
[132:49.28]Well, Pendrew, I guess everyone gets what he deserves, including you.
[132:54.14]You ready for life in prison?
[132:56.14]What?
[132:57.22]Because all your old buddies are going to be waiting for you.
[133:01.26]I made sure they found out what you did to Uncle Poe.
[133:04.06]That's a fucking death sentence.
[133:06.35]I know.
[133:07.83]Where you can't.
[133:09.77]I won't last a day in there.
[133:12.11]That's the plan.
[133:16.32]I leave him like a bunch of stuff.
[133:17.42]That's the plan.
[133:18.57]I don't want to make it too easy.
[133:20.05]Here's a knife.
[133:21.15]Here's a gun with 12 bullets.
[133:22.59]And 20 packs of cigarettes.
[133:23.65]There's currency in there, don't you know?
[133:26.49]I don't know.
[133:26.77]Job's over, but...
[133:45.69]I don't really have anywhere else to go.
[133:48.97]Strange to say it after all that's happened, but Hong Kong kind of feels like home.
[133:56.60]Yeah.
[133:58.68]But which Hong Kong, officer?
[134:07.79]And what about Wei Shen?
[134:09.95]He proved himself to be loyal to me.
[134:12.85]One way or the other.
[134:14.88]And isn't that what really matters?
[134:17.97]Leave him be.
[134:19.31]Yes, Aunt Jane.
[134:22.37]Drive.
[134:26.58]Sleeping Dogs 2.
[134:27.34]The Woman in the Red Dress.
[134:36.94]Well, I think I've been playing for a little while now, and I'm fairly certain I can give you guys a first impressions.
[134:43.97]Had a little bit of time in the game, just wanna give you a first impressions video.
[134:48.03]So the controls could be a little bit sloppy sometimes, but I feel like I'll get used to that as we go on.
[134:54.85]I also think that, graphically, there was some pop-in in the beginning of the game here.
[134:59.88]I'm not sure if that was intentional, if maybe they had a little bit of design issues, but I feel like as we continue to play, as I try out some more, that I'll figure it out for myself, you know?
[135:16.88]Oh, it didn't even go that fast.
[135:20.83]Fast forward, where's the rewind?
[135:34.56]What is back?
[135:35.40]Should I press back?
[135:37.18]No, there's definitely going to be an end to the credits.
[135:38.92]Credits.
[135:44.56]Okay.
[135:44.90]Alright.
[135:45.20]Alright.
[135:45.46]I'm closing my eyes.
[135:47.02]I'm closing my eyes.
[135:47.86]And, and, and, and, and.
[135:49.64]Opening them.
[135:52.30]Dan Sochan is going to be in the next Rumble as a producer.
[135:55.24]Dan Sochan.
[136:00.41]It's going to be lead United Front producer, Dan Sochan.
[136:15.61]Mod him Yeah, alright button up for real we're gonna we're not gonna be not done I want to check out a couple of other things This game is great I'm glad I got to experience this pretty much from start to finish
[136:41.14]Very good game.
[136:42.76]We're just going to dick around in the DLC for a little bit.
[136:44.72]I don't know if I'm going to complete it all, but we're going to go do some of it.
[136:47.26]We're going to go back to the island and fight.
[136:55.47]But, yeah.
[136:57.03]Great game.
[136:58.25]I was very much enthralled and interested the whole time.
[137:02.71]Very fun.
[137:04.85]Somebody said the DLC sucks.
[137:09.15]What?
[137:10.92]Does it?
[137:11.54]I mean, we still have like three or four more bosses in the DLC.
[137:16.68]Look at how many people it takes to make a video game.
[137:21.37]Like, honest to God, is this a development team or is this a graduating class?
[137:25.65]There's like fucking hundreds of people on this team.
[137:30.49]This is the Dean's List at a college.
[137:33.29]So many fucking people made this game.
[137:50.62]It's the credits to the Infinity War.
[137:59.50]One of the DLCs is not good.
[138:03.91]God of War had like 3,000 people on the dev team?
[138:07.45]What?
[138:09.31]What?
[138:09.79]No, it did not.
[138:10.73]That's a city.
[138:14.25]That's a whole town of people made God of War.
[138:19.39]That's not fucking real.
[138:22.00]That would be an entire town.
[138:25.74]Everybody in the whole town is all working on God of War.
[138:32.09]3,000 people.
[138:42.95]That's this whole stream.
[138:44.24]Well, this is only 2,200 people here.
[138:48.29]That's practically the Vatican.
[138:58.64]This is a long list of credits.
[139:02.02]You know what I always, whenever I watch credits... What's the deal with... I've seen Executive Producer like seven times.
[139:11.52]I think these are all different companies, right, that were licensed out for the game's technology, right?
[139:17.52]You have the guys that maybe gave the lighting patent and the engine and then, like, the marketing team.
[139:23.30]That's what that is, right?
[139:25.23]Well, there's the marketing team.
[139:26.25]There's only three people.
[139:36.65]Skip the credits.
[139:37.45]I can't at this point.
[139:53.66]Front End Music.
[139:54.78]Oh, no.
[139:56.93]Special thanks to Mr. Easter.
[140:00.35]I always want to see this part.
[140:06.09]Okay.
[140:10.23]Terry Lynn System.
[140:12.47]Oh, these are the songs.
[140:13.30]Okay.
[140:18.44]Available on the album days to come.
[140:38.62]Can you play through the game again?
[140:39.72]I didn't hear what the bad guy said at the end.
[140:43.50]Yeah, you know, I will.
[140:44.76]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[140:47.10]Just, like, put me in the background and get another tab for, like, 24 hours.
[140:51.00]Like, 26 hours, whatever.
[140:53.55]And, like, I'll, like, snap my fingers when we get there.
[140:57.35]Sorry about that, man.
[141:07.54]I'll just be silent the whole time.
[141:13.85]The only thing you'll hear out of my voice is... Hey, I'm here, man.
[141:22.12]Alright, I think I'm... No, I can't skip.
[141:23.78]It's too late.
[141:34.67]Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend.
[141:37.49]It could have been.
[141:45.56]Have I done a silent stream joke yet?
[141:47.52]Nope.
[141:48.04]And I never will really for more than 10 to 20 seconds because people will leave.
[141:58.72]There's like five more minutes of songs.
[142:03.63]No, this is not.
[142:07.99]It's, like, awesome.
[142:10.31]Why do they have to be this spaced out?
[142:13.11]Look at how much... Credits don't make any sense to me.
[142:15.82]Look at all the real estate that's on this screen.
[142:18.70]Okay?
[142:20.06]Let me show you this.
[142:22.28]Why do they always just have, like, one thing right in the middle?
[142:25.28]Look what you could do.
[142:26.94]The credits could be over in 30 seconds.
[142:29.98]Like, watch this.
[142:43.41]Look at how much more stuff you can fit here.
[142:50.04]Imagine these are all names.
[142:59.51]You don't have to have one part of the screen.
[143:04.47]This could be directors, producers.
[143:07.09]Think of all the fucking things you could accomplish.
[143:15.44]The credits could be over in less than one minute.
[143:23.98]The credits could even be like, could just flash.
[143:29.96]Why didn't I do that on my credits?
[143:33.56]Oh shit, I can't even... Oh, this is not good.
[143:40.30]Oh fuck, I have to manually do this.
[143:42.69]Do I?
[143:43.07]I have to manually delete all these.
[143:57.32]I... Fuck.
[143:58.57]Hold on.
[144:04.25]Get... Control-click?
[144:14.07]That doesn't turn them off, though.
[144:16.62]It's alright, we're good.
[144:18.38]Alright.
[144:19.78]I thought those were... No, okay, those are not mine.
[144:29.05]Somebody said, look, Strange Talk by the artist Climbing Walls.
[144:34.17]If you have this much music... At least don't have them spaced out.
[144:42.22]Look at how many times the person pressed enter.
[144:44.78]Like five or six times.
[144:53.93]Why are we still here?
[144:58.43]You never did take on me karaoke.
[145:03.87]These are all the songs that play in the credits.
[145:05.35]Alright, well, let's might as well do my credits too at the same time, right?
[145:23.79]Get it over with, right?
[145:24.47]You know, together.
[145:25.01]Okay, here we go.
[145:32.45]Uh, so... Let me see if I can get both the credits.
[145:36.83]Their credits and my credits.

[153:43.82]That's literally the weekend you won't have access to a computer.
[153:46.95]Why not?
[153:52.09]Looks like the nightmare is winning so far.
[153:54.43]Currently by a little bit.
[153:57.47]By at least a little bit.
[154:11.34]It's not really that close.
[154:14.65]If you really, really... Yeah, I don't know.
[154:21.49]60-40, 60-139, I don't think it's going to happen.

[155:10.22]So is this just Red Dead's undead nightmare, but melee, and in China?
[155:19.03]But they're hatered, their bitterness planning their revenge.
[155:24.51]When the gates of hell open, the Gyeongsi come forth, an undead army at their back, and all of Hong Kong at their mercy.
[155:36.04]That was the worst movie of all time.
[155:38.48]Who makes up this stuff?
[155:39.84]Anyway, niece, don't make fun of the girl I'm seeing.
[155:44.30]A night like this, they might be on their way.
[155:48.18]I hope this game gets a Battle Royale DLC.
[155:51.00]No, Uncle Salty, me.
[155:52.54]This is Hong Kong.
[155:54.42]Magic crawls through this town like maggots on month-old roadkill.
[155:58.15]Undead Nightmare was fun.
[156:00.27]Well, you see any walking corpses, you give me a call.
[156:04.19]Okay.
[156:04.99]No, don't hold left shint to sprint.
[156:10.30]Left shint?

[156:12.18]What the fuck am I talking about?
[156:16.54]Shift!

[156:48.39]Left shint.
[156:50.91]Left shint to sprint.
[156:57.16]Talking motor skills?
[156:58.22]Talking is a motor skill.
[157:02.79]You think you can chase me down?
[157:04.87]You're a joke, Shen.
[157:09.80]Alright, I got him.
[157:13.24]Persistent, are you?
[157:16.10]I caught him.
[157:16.92]I was right next to him.
[157:23.96]You don't know what's coming.
[157:26.64]I've had decades to blast.
[157:28.12]Wait, get me out of this thing.
[157:29.76]Get me out of this thing.
[157:33.04]This is just the start.
[157:37.06]I've waited 30 years for this.
[157:40.52]I haven't come here for 30 years, Lawrence.
[157:45.20]No demons taking me down.
[157:47.62]Hurry up, boy.
[157:48.28]Hurry up.
[157:51.49]Grapple, counter.
[157:52.51]Yeah.
[157:52.73]Do I have the same moves or?
[157:54.25]I'm not sure.
[157:56.33]I have, like, demon powers.
[158:06.69]Yes.
[158:10.93]Creepy guys.
[158:11.69]Creepy guys.
[158:12.63]So you have to... That's how you can't kill them.
[158:17.50]You have to stun them.
[158:19.46]And then that's the grapple move.
[158:20.78]You do the super punch.
[158:26.22]Follow the footprints.
[158:28.68]I will.
[158:37.36]Get out of the way!
[158:44.77]Seriously, you guys just need to stop running directly in my way or I'm gonna start cracking some skulls.
[158:49.31]Alright, I'm gonna start cracking skulls.
[158:53.23]Bad enough.
[158:54.83]That went so high in the air.
[159:15.32]Clumsy.
[159:19.60]Clumsy.
[159:20.84]I beg to differ.
[159:28.09]No!
[159:28.53]Get away, I gotta finish him.
[159:35.96]So is this just the kind of melee fighting?
[159:37.58]He just melee fight?
[159:40.84]Or is there more to this story?
[159:56.41]The animations are so goofy.
[159:58.38]I can burn these guys.
[159:59.22]Come here.
[160:03.44]Please.
[160:04.84]Get over here.
[160:05.80]Into the trap.
[160:10.47]Speak with the sacred man.
[160:11.99]The scared man.
[160:15.07]Have you seen others?
[160:17.93]I had to wake him up first.
[160:20.13]He was giving them instructions.
[160:22.19]Did he have a girl with him?
[160:23.50]Yes.
[160:24.22]He went that way.
[160:27.95]How long is this DLC?
[160:32.68]Is this DLC long?
[160:33.70]Like, what?
[160:34.12]Like, 20?
[160:34.32]10 minutes?
[160:34.56]Imagine if a DLC was 10 minutes.
[160:35.64]Introducing the DLC!
[160:57.85]It is less than ten minutes.
[160:59.45]It's like one to two hours.
[161:06.48]Well, I kind of want to see the other one, too.
[161:07.74]So let's get... Here's what we're gonna do.
[161:09.20]We're gonna do a DLC sample.
[161:14.28]We're gonna taste both of the DLCs.
[161:16.67]We tasted the Island of Ra one.
[161:18.43]That was pretty cool.
[161:19.13]We're tasting the Demon, Cheshire Cat, Alice in Wonderland one.
[161:23.29]And we'll sample the other one, too.
[161:25.37]So we're gonna get a taste of all three DLCs.
[161:29.60]Yeah, we're just gonna sip on the DLCs for a minute.
[162:05.68]Is that supposed to happen?
[162:09.90]That's definitely supposed to happen.
[162:12.04]Because it's a fucking Halloween game.
[162:13.58]Yeah.
[162:15.44]I wouldn't be surprised.
[162:20.87]That was like somebody drove a car into the side of my house over here.
[162:25.77]Oh yeah, by the way, the DLC has some really loud parts.
[162:29.93]Oh, you don't say.
[162:30.86]You don't say.
[162:43.67]What's going on here?
[162:44.53]I mean, this girl, is that girl innocent?
[162:50.41]I mean, technically.
[162:53.37]Oh my god!
[163:01.17]Oh my god!
[163:03.21]Oh my god!
[163:13.09]What's going on?
[163:13.85]I'm in, like, a dream.
[163:18.71]Sorry, lady.
[163:20.47]Are there demon ca- I was gonna say, are there demon cars?
[163:24.61]I guess I was- I guess there are.
[163:28.82]Speak with Vincent.
[163:30.26]Vincent!
[163:32.58]I'd like to speak with you.
[163:33.64]Vincent?
[163:39.52]I thought you were dead.
[163:41.74]And it's a drag, let me tell you.
[163:43.72]I've been craving noodles for I don't know how long.
[163:46.74]By the way, I think you've got a problem out back.
[163:50.18]What the hell is going on?
[163:51.66]I don't know.
[163:52.76]One minute I'm down there, the next I'm up here.
[163:55.25]So I thought, what the hell, might as well grab some soup.
[163:57.77]You guys could leave an offering for a brother now and then, you know?
[164:00.69]Check out back.
[164:08.48]Is this the lady?
[164:10.88]Oh wow, you slimmed down.
[164:12.02]Does this DLC take place five years in the future when mom lost like 150 pounds?
[164:18.03]Nice.
[164:18.47]Uh oh, demon prince DLC boss.
[164:40.94]Before and after.
[164:44.34]Fight the Yogwai.
[164:46.12]I'm going to have to counter him.
[164:47.78]He's probably going to... Yeah.
[164:49.12]Yeah.
[164:49.32]Come on.
[164:49.58]Come on.
[165:09.83]I'm trying to do the counter punch thing I guess I can't Alright, I'll listen to you dad
[165:34.72]Get out.
[165:35.02]Get out of here.
[165:35.66]Get out of there.
[165:36.68]Gonna need some Chinese magic.
[165:38.86]No.
[165:39.00]Do I get to have magic moves?
[165:41.24]Old salty crap.
[166:04.42]I don't know how to deal with zombies.
[166:06.17]The old fashioned way.
[166:07.07]Whoa.
[166:11.36]That's a zombie, right?
[166:12.18]Yeah.
[166:12.28]The ship is exploding?
[166:13.52]A weapon to kill demons?
[166:14.10]Ta-da!
[166:55.84]Nice.
[166:57.08]Perfect.
[167:04.87]Free the apothecary.
[167:11.89]Doink.
[167:13.31]Doink.
[167:25.38]Alright, where's my magic?
[167:26.72]I want to at least get to see the magic part of this.
[167:28.54]No!
[167:46.77]That sounds appetizing.
[167:47.65]Ghost pepper, antifreeze, and a chicken egg.
[167:50.49]I think this guy's been smoking crack.
[168:09.98]And feel 195 brake horsepower take you through the... No, I can't call, uh, Takla.
[168:16.30]You hear how Smiley Cat got his nickname?
[168:19.57]Isn't it a cat food?
[168:21.59]Yeah.
[168:22.33]When he was alive, his street name was Big Scar Woo.
[168:25.43]Tony Tail and a couple of the other guys killed him on Uncle Pozo.
[168:28.25]He's a small piece of driving cars.
[168:30.10]The ninth in 42 times.
[168:31.80]They chopped up the body and put it through the grinder at the Smiley Cat processing plant.
[168:36.40]So Big Skull Wu ended up feeding house pets all over town.
[168:39.56]Ponytail didn't even put him into the high protein mix.
[168:42.16]So a lot of the cats just barfed him up afterwards.
[168:44.26]So these people were all dead.
[168:46.51]Where are they coming from?
[168:49.49]So now everyone calls Wu Smiley Cat.
[168:54.17]That could be worse.
[168:55.17]They could have ground him up in the fertilizer.
[168:58.41]Oh, he just appeared in the car.
[168:59.41]That's funny.
[169:09.23]I gotta beat the demon out of everybody.
[169:17.53]Can't climb up any of this shit.
[169:21.40]Yes I can.
[169:22.10]Don't tell me what I can and can't climb on top of.
[169:27.46]Oh please, really.
[169:31.70]I wanna climb.
[169:39.86]What the fuck?
[169:40.38]Oh.
[169:51.49]Give me the ghost pepper!
[169:53.05]Find a way to the ghost pepper.
[169:58.53]Um.
[170:02.68]I'm confused.
[170:03.32]Alright.
[170:15.85]There's nothing funnier then.
[170:28.32]The person's voice slowed down and distorted.
[170:30.32]I'm not sure there is anything funnier.
[170:41.31]I'm going to go back this way.
[170:42.33]It was a long fall.
[170:49.03]Pepper.
[170:51.86]Now we need... What do we need?
[170:58.94]Oh, there's a dog barking.
[171:06.01]I don't like never barks.
[171:08.65]I just heard like...
[171:15.06]That guy was thinking about attacking me, but he still is.
[171:22.19]Talk.
[171:24.33]You ran into me on the wrong day, buddy.
[171:27.69]See, I told you, there's nothing funnier.
[171:36.30]You ran into me on the wrong day, buddy.
[171:37.86]Sorry, shop closed.
[171:39.22]I need the egg of an albino head, right away.
[171:43.59]Pick Otto up from the airport.
[171:45.14]Get rid of the... people... the taggers.
[171:47.36]These guys?
[171:47.78]I mean... Random explosion shit is really kind of... of these guys.
[172:12.44]Alright, check it.
[172:14.70]Dealt with.
[172:16.06]Now locate the antifreeze.
[172:41.12]Oh, the zombie taxi driver can't drive.
[172:46.24]Damn it, Vincent.
[172:47.10]You gotta stop appearing like that.
[172:48.32]Sorry, Wade.
[172:49.68]You scared the shit out of me.
[172:51.14]I said I was sorry.
[172:52.52]It's hard being dead, man.
[172:54.13]People didn't like me much when I was alive.
[172:56.33]But this is so much worse.
[172:58.53]Nobody lighting candles for me.
[173:00.21]Nobody making offerings.
[173:01.93]Scary.
[173:02.13]Never used to take that shit seriously.
[173:03.69]Turns out, it matters, man.
[173:06.47]I was gonna drift but there was a big bus.
[173:08.29]Perfect drift.
[173:08.75]18k.
[173:35.53]I'm not gonna do a cryptocurrency joke.
[173:37.07]I refuse to.
[173:39.49]Just imagine I just did.
[173:42.99]Just like imagine I did right there.
[173:44.25]So no more face meter.
[173:49.09]Here we are.
[173:49.45]What?
[174:08.87]Get out of the way, I'm trying to knife somebody.
[174:24.83]Oh, the face meter comes back with magic abilities.
[174:26.55]Alright, that's cool.
[174:35.72]See ya.
[174:37.68]Ain't doing that.
[174:38.94]I'll drop you like a sack of fucking potatoes.
[174:47.14]Nope.
[174:47.59]Whoops.
[174:55.75]Get up.
[174:59.25]Oh, wait.
[175:01.23]Come here.
[175:10.00]This isn't gonna kill you, but it's gonna be funny.
[175:18.00]Oh, it does!
[175:18.58]Alright.
[175:27.12]Alright, I got all the ingredients.
[175:32.52]What's with all the mustards?
[175:39.96]Why are we doing... Is my internet fucked up?
[175:44.68]Why are we doing the jermaMustard?
[175:45.68]Have we got frames dropped?
[175:46.80]No.
[175:47.48]Fuck outta here.
[175:48.14]Herbal tea.
[176:06.98]Oh, you just feel like it.
[176:07.90]Alright, that's cool.
[176:08.38]What the fuck was that?
[176:09.69]Somebody just snorted.
[176:11.43]Somebody just snorted back here.
[176:39.93]Magic hands, that's cool.
[176:48.39]Alright, let's turn this in.
[176:49.35]Let's do some magic powers and then let's sample the other DLC.
[176:55.39]Let's give a taste of the other DLC.
[177:11.55]Drink a little bit of antifreeze and let's move on.
[177:16.03]Here we go.
[177:16.39]Oh, didn't catch you doing that.
[177:18.91]Suck out his soul.
[177:43.98]Here we go.
[177:47.78]Is he gonna get confused that I can hurt him?
[177:54.51]I get it.
[177:55.59]I get the gimmick of this DLC.
[177:58.61]You can only hurt certain enemies when you have a full meter.
[178:03.04]And nothing more, nothing less.
[178:14.26]Can I get a bit of camera angle, please?
[178:30.14]Get out of the way.
[178:35.28]Stop it!
[178:38.26]Stop it!
[178:42.74]This is some great magic.
[178:46.24]No, wait, wait, wait, it gets better, it gets better.
[178:48.19]Just wait, it gets better, man.
[178:56.48]Told you.
[179:04.42]He's dead.
[179:20.75]Why are they hopping around?
[179:29.41]Now this would have been cool if this was a lightning sword.
[179:30.99]If this was a light... Let me just look to the left.
[179:33.95]God damn!
[179:53.62]My brain was trying to collect its thoughts and then... Jesus Christ, man.
[180:03.76]So every time you complete a mission, the game screams in your ear.
[180:09.27]Hydrate.
[180:13.75]I would love... Just put the phone down, man.
[180:18.63]Hydrate loudly.
[180:23.70]We're going to hydrate and we're going to do it loudly.
[180:26.34]I don't know why I'm thinking of that right now.
[180:30.58]Next DLC.
[180:31.92]Hold on.
[180:32.46]Five more minutes.
[180:45.76]Oh, by the way, I don't know why that made me think about this.
[180:47.58]So I was watching Saturday.
[180:48.76]You know, like Alec Baldwin's Trump is awful.
[180:52.32]Can I just say that?
[180:55.17]Why do they keep bringing him back to do Trump?
[180:56.79]There's so many other people that are better at Trump.
[180:59.51]This is Alec Baldwin's Trump.
[181:02.19]Okay, let me tell you something.
[181:05.25]We are going to do it like this.
[181:07.87]He sounds like Arnold.
[181:11.97]Get a better Trump.
[181:14.35]Okay, let's talk about this for a second.
[181:17.72]I'm going to do it legally.
[181:19.88]Dude, man.
[181:20.42]Dude, man.
[181:21.04]Dude, man.
[181:27.17]Stop in the name of the police.
[181:44.31]Dude, man, the worst superhero.
[181:46.97]I know that you have all been waiting for me to return.
[181:51.20]Together, we will crush the Sanonyi and take over the city.
[182:01.94]And he does this thing, where he just, he always has his lips pushed out.
[182:09.56]And just, mmm.
[182:10.40]And just, just like this.
[182:12.64]Get up out of Trump, come on.
[182:20.28]I've seen like at least five people on TV that do it.
[182:26.00]He does like the permanent pursed lips.
[182:33.44]I mean, Alec Baldwin, I loved you in Ocean's Eleven, but... I mean... I don't know if I enjoy you doing this.
[182:42.35]No, no, no.
[182:45.91]He was in Boss Baby.
[182:46.85]Why is the only Alec Baldwin acting career job I can think of is Boss Baby?
[182:52.22]No.
[182:53.78]What else has he ever done?
[182:55.18]What is Alec Baldwin in besides Boss Baby?
[182:59.28]Oh my god, I'm not going to look at chat because I don't know.
[183:05.94]I don't know.
[183:25.80]What was he in besides Boss Baby?
[183:30.30]Alec Baldwin.
[183:30.94]Yeah, he was in Beetlejuice.
[183:32.80]Oh, um... Third Rock from the Sun.
[183:34.08]30 Rock.
[183:34.32]30th Rock from the Sun, yeah.
[183:35.72]30 Rock.
[183:55.45]Now that's John Lithgow.
[183:56.85]John Lithgow.
[183:58.32]Mary, I do believe.
[183:59.06]He's an alien, Mary.
[184:02.51]Just like me, my wonderful body is just a vehicle to carry my brain around.
[184:07.93]And my brain deserves a smooth, luxurious ride.
[184:10.25]Maybe that's why he's so pissed off.
[184:12.11]One thing you ought to know, best way to fight the undead is with a peach wick saw.
[184:16.51]You got me?
[184:18.37]Yeah, that show was great.
[184:19.97]Yes, it was.
[184:20.61]Keep an eye out for them, poor bastards.
[184:24.55]I hear they were looking for every supernatural weapon they could find.
[184:28.34]Don't lose, don't lose.
[184:29.82]Shit!
[184:29.96]I saw the GPS update and I freaked the fuck out.
[184:33.68]Argh!
[185:01.08]He's in The Departed?
[185:01.90]No, you're thinking of Jack Nicholson.
[185:06.98]Now, that's a guy I would love to see do Trump.
[185:11.16]I would love a Jack Nicholson Trump.
[185:17.27]How great would that be?
[185:24.35]That would be incredible, actually.
[185:39.43]Break his arm.
[185:43.44]Rick Moranis should do Trump.
[185:47.52]No.
[185:47.98]Get Jack Nicholson in that Trump role.
[185:53.62]Johnny Depp did it, but, I mean, it wasn't, no.
[185:56.18]Yeah, give me Jack Nicholson.
[186:03.80]But have him play it dead serious.
[186:05.93]It's not a comedy role.
[186:11.28]Just give him a fat neck.
[186:13.18]That's all you have to do is just give him a neck fat prosthetic.
[186:17.15]Give him the hair.
[186:17.73]And just have him be Jack Nicholson.
[186:22.67]Dead serious role.
[186:42.79]Eat him?
[186:45.47]Do a throw?
[186:47.31]Sure thing, man.
[186:51.21]I'm 50% of the way through the DLC already.
[186:53.13]I am?
[186:53.53]That doesn't seem right.
[187:07.78]Throw them into the energy.
[187:13.06]What do you mean like this?
[187:16.23]This three mission- Well, I'm sorry, this DLC kinda sucks.
[187:19.85]Alright?
[187:20.29]Maybe we just do the same thing three times.
[187:46.20]I don't like his face.
[187:54.55]The entire game sucks, excuse me.
[187:56.59]No, it does not.
[187:57.39]Alright, this just got way better.
[188:05.96]Zodiac Tournament was the coolest one, I think, so far.
[188:10.84]I mean, sure, this is kind of cool.
[188:13.01]It's like monsters and shit.
[188:25.97]I'm gonna throw him into the energy.
[188:29.96]The power looks cool.
[188:30.82]He froze in there for a minute for some reason.
[188:44.63]Alright, let's taste the other one.
[188:46.01]I wanna see what the other one tastes like.
[188:56.32]Can you really break a zombie's leg like that and it hurts?
[188:59.85]I guess.
[189:00.59]You think I care?
[189:02.29]You think I'm impressed?
[189:04.07]Where is she?
[189:04.99]You have bigger problems than her, you shit.
[189:07.81]Nobody messes with Big Sky.
[189:10.03]Nobody gets away with it.
[189:11.95]Never heard of him.
[189:13.53]Smiley cat.
[189:26.44]Somebody said Illidan in the chat.
[189:29.32]That is what I think of.
[189:30.18]That's all I can think of is Illidan.
[189:32.96]Am I going to do Stardew Valley multiplayer?
[189:34.56]Is it out?
[189:36.76]God!
[190:05.46]I'm done with that one.
[190:10.12]Let's try the Year of the Snake.
[190:23.61]It's in beta.
[190:26.30]That's cool.
[190:28.30]Might have to give that a try, actually.
[190:39.09]Yeah, there's a snake.
[190:40.07]Next already?
[190:40.93]Come on, man.
[191:01.64]Do I have to be undercover again?
[191:03.14]Is this the same thing?
[191:03.76]Police tell me I actually just get to go write tickets.
[191:06.54]This would be great.
[191:32.32]I already like this DLC.
[191:33.48]Please tell me I get to do this.
[191:35.61]I get to write tickets and break up crimes and just be like a street policeman.
[191:40.83]Make me a beat cop.
[191:41.59]Come on.
[191:44.85]No, I want to do this stuff.
[191:46.25]Don't put it in a cutscene.
[191:47.21]That means I'm not going to be able to do it.
[191:59.32]Yes!
[192:01.38]This sucks.
[192:07.57]Am I gonna- Am I gonna try and chase this guy?
[192:32.61]Alright, stop right there!
[192:36.97]Steamed controller fucked up.
[192:38.75]Watch out for the grenades.
[192:40.87]Guy in yellow.
[193:02.61]How's that controller holding up, by the way?
[193:04.67]It's doing just fine.
[193:06.15]Thank you very much.
[193:09.77]Hey.
[193:10.55]Couldn't be better.
[193:11.23]You seen a guy in a yellow shirt?
[193:15.50]Me.
[193:16.06]Him.
[193:16.86]He's right there.
[193:17.40]I think he's there.
[193:18.98]It's you!
[193:19.50]Stop!
[193:19.86]Police!
[193:22.66]Hey, pursue the suspect!
[193:24.26]Holy m- Oh, the guy's ch-
[193:45.11]Okay, locate the next suspect I saw a guy hiding over there.
[193:59.04]Thanks.
[193:59.34]I'll take it from here
[194:03.57]So I have to run around and grab people?
[194:07.86]Grab him!
[194:10.46]Excuse me, can't grab.
[194:11.84]I have to just chase for like 10 minutes.
[194:13.44]This is true crime, meter made.
[194:23.63]I'll return these soon, ma'am!
[194:39.04]Final suspect up here.
[194:44.41]Excuse me, but I need more groceries.
[194:47.09]That's the only way I know how to apprehend suspects.
[194:49.53]Just put the groceries down.
[194:51.56]Thank you.
[194:52.90]I don't understand any other way.
[194:54.38]I wasn't trained any other way.
[195:10.70]Okay.
[195:12.06]This is a weird guy.
[195:20.37]Wait, what do you got in there?
[195:25.41]You got cans in there?
[195:27.35]Thank you.
[195:29.09]I just had moldy, mushed up fruit.
[195:47.80]Get over here.
[195:49.72]Zap.
[195:51.22]Zap one.
[195:53.56]Yes, that's right.
[195:55.10]I'm not sure if I'm in the right place.
[195:57.06]I missed the Wiggles concert.
[195:59.64]I gotta apprehend all the fucking Wiggles.
[196:04.48]They're selling drugs to kids.
[196:15.05]Uh, um, can I please fucking arrest these guys?
[196:17.75]Okay, I think I might have burnt them.
[196:26.70]No, just, you're under arrest.
[196:29.44]You can't!
[196:38.44]What is this?
[196:40.75]20 evidence bags.
[196:47.83]Oh, the red wiggle is dead?
[196:50.43]He was dead weight anyways.
[196:51.47]He wasn't that good of a singer.
[196:52.71]What?
[196:54.53]Don't!
[196:56.63]Don't!
[196:59.51]Don't!
[197:00.57]Don't!
[197:00.91]Don't!
[197:01.15]Don't!
[197:02.33]Don't touch!
[197:03.51]Don't touch!
[197:04.95]Don't touch!
[197:05.45]Don't!
[197:08.61]Alright, I'm disposing of the bomb.
[197:13.46]But killing way more people than the bomb probably would have gotten.
[197:16.02]And...
[197:21.88]What do you mean, into the bay?
[197:26.93]I don't have a GPS.
[197:31.27]I can't do anything without a GPS.
[197:33.97]I seriously can't do anything without a GPS in real life, too.
[197:41.70]Here we go.
[197:48.12]Get away from the bomb!
[197:53.91]Alright, we're good.
[197:57.69]This is fun.
[197:58.49]I like this one.
[198:00.51]Ran a person over.
[198:27.25]Get out of the car!
[198:29.63]It's right here, whatever, fuck it.
[198:35.18]Hong Kong's finest.
[198:54.08]This car sucks.
[199:01.79]Oh, that's a broken arm.
[199:03.97]I'm fine, though.
[199:07.67]Move, motherfuckers!
[199:08.83]Hong Kong police!
[199:09.81]Oh, I miss him.
[199:14.57]I wanna be that guy again.
[199:20.39]Move, motherfuckers!
[199:21.65]Police!
[199:23.40]He just had so much weight behind that.
[199:25.28]That's not... Hong Kong police!
[199:26.96]No.
[199:27.48]Move, motherfucker!
[199:28.85]Police.
[199:29.25]That guy was amazing.
[199:33.75]Why did I just get a car to go here?
[200:00.83]Trapped.
[200:02.87]They're pulling out teeth and shit.
[200:05.57]Oh no, wait a minute.
[200:06.51]I know what this is.
[200:07.09]This is a cryptocurrency mining underground illegal facility.
[200:11.45]I'm sorry.
[200:14.19]It happened.
[200:15.01]You knew it was going to happen at some point.
[200:16.25]I can't contain it.
[200:21.27]Hate me all you want.
[200:22.39]Just hate me.
[200:23.59]Shit.
[200:28.50]I know everyone's gonna be mad at me.
[200:30.49]These bastards.
[200:33.39]Okay, well.
[200:38.39]I'm gonna give it a try.
[200:41.29]Nope.
[200:41.89]So, you know what?
[200:43.27]Fuck you all.
[200:44.53]I'm not dicking around like this anymore.
[200:59.76]Oh, wait, I need to arrest them.
[201:00.98]Right, okay.
[201:05.43]I got it.
[201:06.83]Oh, see?
[201:07.85]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[201:08.99]Give me some help here.
[201:14.41]They're arresting them.
[201:15.53]I'm not.
[201:17.11]They're like, you know, we kind of need to get somebody in there to do some arresting.
[201:19.85]Some actual arresting.
[201:36.36]I caught that guy in the air after doing a full front flip What's that me
[201:51.04]When the new year starts, it's all over.
[201:54.58]So your prisons, your laws, they don't mean anything to me.
[201:58.27]What's over?
[201:59.41]What happens on New Year's?
[202:01.33]The world, it ends.
[202:04.71]How do you mean ends?
[202:06.61]Master Chu teaches when the year of the state begins, the world will end.
[202:13.91]All of its creatures will be divided into two groups.
[202:18.40]Those who helped usher in the great reckoning
[202:21.33]will feast in heaven alongside the great master himself.
[202:26.57]The unbelievers will be cast down into hell.
[202:31.05]Let me get this straight.
[202:32.79]Where is this Master Chu now?
[202:35.27]I don't know.
[202:36.29]What's going on with the Wiggles here?
[202:38.87]We're all helping.
[202:42.03]Did they change cast members?
[202:44.19]Hundreds.
[202:46.41]I need to get rid of these.
[202:49.21]It's too many of these.
[202:49.89]Son of a bitch.
[203:02.08]They changed cast members.
[203:13.40]Hold on.
[203:13.78]There's a good girl now.
[203:15.92]Hold on.
[203:18.33]Keep that there for now.
[203:22.43]We got a police cruiser.
[203:30.48]Alright, let's keep going.
[203:42.97]Illumination.
[203:43.69]No!
[203:43.75]There's no female Wiggle.
[203:52.53]Yes, there is.
[203:54.59]Call the valet.
[203:56.68]Hey, it's Wei.
[203:58.36]I need a car.
[203:58.88]A car?
[204:02.20]What do you mean, no?
[204:07.46]There's a female wiggle now.
[204:18.31]Wait, is it different?
[204:19.01]It's a different valet.
[204:24.23]Where's he going?
[204:24.71]Where you going?
[204:25.05]Where you going?
[204:25.41]Where's he going?
[204:25.75]Where's he going?
[204:26.17]Where's he going?
[204:29.37]Move!
[204:29.77]Police!
[204:30.23]This is more important than any other police work I have.
[204:32.49]Get!
[204:44.43]Oh, come on!
[204:45.63]Now he's coming after me?!
[204:49.99]This guy's now after me now.
[204:51.57]The valet.
[204:54.21]Oh, please.
[205:01.01]It's not even the duck lao guy.
[205:02.84]Is the duck lao- is he a police officer now?
[205:27.21]I can't even get on the bike.
[205:28.14]The bike is just toast now.
[205:37.56]Oh, Jesus.
[205:39.14]Get off me.
[205:39.98]Get off me.
[205:40.48]He used your magic.
[205:49.39]Yeah, I should have used my magic.
[205:51.59]Okay, thank you.
[206:05.32]Let's do the mission.
[206:16.20]What did you stick this on?
[206:20.91]Alright, let's do it.
[206:36.03]That is worth like 300 points.
[206:38.01]I tripled in the air.
[206:39.05]Hit three objects in the air without falling off the bike.
[206:41.07]I think I win.
[206:44.69]Need an undercover outfit.
[206:47.61]Get an undercover outfit from the store.
[206:55.73]I'd like outfit, please.
[206:57.23]Yeah, it was a pinball machine.
[207:02.37]There's a group in Soho.
[207:04.01]We've learned that our guys are going to buy something from a dealer out there.
[207:06.66]Find out what he's selling.
[207:08.02]I'm on it.
[207:11.90]There's my bike.
[207:17.26]Should I roll up on the police bike?
[207:18.36]Yeah.
[207:23.91]What look you going for, sir?
[207:24.97]Oh, you know, something flashy.
[207:26.99]Something... Nice and... Muted.
[207:31.05]Something that screams... Undercover cop blazer.
[207:37.37]Muted mustard.
[207:41.74]Every undercover cop dress is exactly the same.
[207:44.52]They have a... Kind of a muted puke... Colored blazer.
[207:48.74]A button-up.
[207:49.44]And a pair of dark jeans.
[207:51.08]Central.
[207:52.06]I'm at the K-Bar.
[208:04.01]I just, like, shotgunned into the door.
[208:07.31]What happened?
[208:10.29]Well, I guess if I saw a guy shotgun into the door, I probably would say the same thing, too.
[208:12.97]Alright, eavesdrop on conversations.
[208:20.74]Okay, this is a closet.
[208:23.18]Detective work.
[208:24.10]Figured that out.
[208:24.84]Found that out.
[208:28.54]This way.
[208:31.60]Make sure I sniff out.
[208:32.78]Make sure there's no bugs.
[208:41.25]Nice conversation.
[208:42.83]The bike will fit.
[208:46.27]Will it?
[209:12.75]No, it won't.
[209:14.87]The bike's not gonna fit in here.
[209:26.70]Fuck.
[209:29.55]Stop making me do this.
[209:31.87]Stop making me do this.
[209:33.19]Why are you making me do this?
[209:43.34]Go!
[209:44.46]Get in there!
[209:45.48]Get in the building!
[209:55.55]Oh my god, it's in.
[210:01.42]Okay, let's go eavesdrop on some conversations and figure out what people are doing down here.
[210:14.02]Undercover police officer.
[210:15.14]Just make sure I can be really sneaky and silent.
[210:28.97]Okay.
[210:29.65]I think she's clean.
[210:35.79]Whoa!
[210:41.97]I gotta find the dealer.
[210:46.22]We might be back here somewhere.
[210:48.14]Wait, he said backpedaling.
[210:49.14]They know!
[210:52.99]I gotta get out of here.
[210:59.73]Talk to the dealer.
[211:06.79]Alright, you got any drugs for me, man?
[211:11.83]Yeah.
[211:12.57]Hey, what about those fucking drugs, huh?
[211:16.19]Yeah, me too.
[211:17.75]I think so.
[211:18.31]Uh-oh.
[212:00.41]Everything's under control.
[212:04.51]I think he knows I'm a cop now.
[212:06.01]Alright.
[212:15.18]Hold on.
[212:23.09]Fuck!
[212:24.19]I just had the thing on the screen.
[212:26.41]What was that?
[212:28.21]See how it was lit up?
[212:30.95]I'm gonna fucking murder this guy.
[212:33.79]What's he looking for?
[212:54.10]Get out of the way, dude.
[212:55.37]Alright, let's see if I can get him in the other room.
[213:07.75]He's painting his blood everywhere.
[213:10.63]Push him into the ocean.
[213:15.12]Guys... I'm gonna push this guy into the ocean.
[213:26.27]That's exactly what I had to do.
[213:38.02]Welcome to the rest of the stream.
[213:49.54]I'm gonna get a car though.
[213:50.86]And I'll be able to push him into the ocean.
[213:54.60]Oh fuck.
[213:55.29]Oh fuck.
[213:57.28]Slowly but surely.
[213:58.40]Don't worry.
[213:58.84]Does everybody hold tight?
[214:00.12]I'm currently arresting this guy.
[214:01.62]Alright, where's the exit?
[214:06.57]Oh, fuck.
[214:07.13]Do I have to get him up the stairs?
[214:08.37]I have to get him up the stairs.
[214:23.17]Fucking ran that lady's foot over.
[214:26.25]That was an explosion.
[214:28.35]Get out of the- what are you fucking people doing over here?
[214:30.34]Get out of the way!
[214:32.16]There's something way more important than yourselves.
[214:35.78]Get out of here!
[214:37.18]The bike is stuck.
[214:39.60]Fuck off!
[214:44.28]Everyone's just like- Fucking get away from me!
[214:52.03]Can't you see I'm a police officer?
[214:53.19]I've proven that.
[214:59.39]Yeah, grab some popcorn or grab a snack or something, guys.
[215:01.45]This guy's going into the water.
[215:13.34]Don't you dare start reciting Bee Movie to me.
[215:18.70]We just have to get him outside.
[215:20.60]And then all will be completely and totally revealed.
[215:24.40]Hard to do on this bike, though.
[215:27.20]Oh, man.
[215:27.78]This is harder than it looks.
[215:35.59]Here we go.
[215:37.53]Straight shot.
[215:38.59]Alright, don't go too fast, because I'll put him against the wall.
[215:40.99]I don't want to do that.
[215:43.15]Okay, right there.
[215:43.91]Let's just line him up.
[215:47.97]Okay, he's good.
[215:53.39]Out the door.
[215:53.93]And then we gotta get a car.
[216:01.34]He actually moved back up on his own here.
[216:05.40]At least a little bit.
[216:06.20]Alright, I gotta be careful because he might get wedged in the door.
[216:08.70]A little bit more to the right.
[216:15.93]This is just like bringing a couch into somebody's house.
[216:20.77]I don't want to have to turn it upside down.
[216:24.37]He's out.
[216:26.17]He's out.
[216:26.69]Okay.
[216:28.91]Let the games begin.
[216:35.94]Let the games begin.
[216:38.10]Where's the ocean?
[216:42.94]Give me that car.
[216:48.77]Police.
[216:49.09]I got something really important.
[216:56.07]Okay, I don't want to go too fast here, because I need to be able to move.
[217:02.01]Alright, so where's the ocean from here?
[217:07.13]I'm afraid to press pause.
[217:21.54]Get him in the road here.
[217:24.14]Yeah, it's going to work.
[217:24.76]He's going to the ocean.
[217:34.95]Alright, everybody put... say... I can't pause it.
[217:37.71]I'm too afraid it'll despawn them.
[217:40.21]We gotta go north.
[218:00.43]This is what we're doing.
[218:02.37]Here we go.
[218:03.25]Get him further.
[218:04.64]Not that crazy.
[218:07.42]Don't get the cops called on me.
[218:13.14]We have to get him out of here.
[218:14.12]Out of this area.
[218:15.96]Fuck!
[218:18.30]I actually just crushed that guy.
[218:19.92]Fuck!
[218:29.18]He is pretty slippery.
[218:32.70]Don't want to get him stuck against a wall.
[218:35.74]Oh, this.
[218:36.56]I didn't do that.
[218:37.18]Somebody got really impatient behind me.
[218:44.82]There's so many police.
[218:49.16]I wonder if I can grab him.
[218:50.50]I'm scared to.
[218:52.70]See you in 20 minutes.
[218:59.74]Don't you ruin this lady.
[219:00.78]Get the fuck away from me.
[219:11.91]Push him on top of the car.
[219:13.33]Alright, we get a straight shot here.
[219:21.10]Straight it out, get in the middle, and we'll push him all the way down.
[219:26.13]He said boring.
[219:27.89]Yeah.
[219:28.19]Well, sorry.
[219:28.93]Sorry like somebody in the Twitch chat, but this is for science man Alright, he's in the car no She really is in the chat
[219:57.52]Oh no!
[220:05.37]Bad.
[220:07.93]Bad.
[220:13.54]Shut up!
[220:14.90]I don't care if it's boring!
[220:21.26]This bitch behind me blew the whole thing.
[220:30.13]Just pass me.
[220:30.93]Pass me.
[220:33.76]Pass me.
[220:35.84]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[220:40.26]Don't let him.
[220:43.20]He's regressing into the wall.
[220:44.05]He's regressing into the wall.
[220:44.89]He's going into the wall.
[220:49.89]Okay, we saved it.
[221:03.80]That guy just took a selfie with him.
[221:06.35]Wow, this is really fascinating.
[221:07.91]This is just Twitch chat.
[221:09.03]Let me take a screenshot of the screen.
[221:13.01]Okay.
[221:13.83]Where's the fucking ocean?
[221:16.65]I'm pausing it.
[221:17.57]Quick!
[221:18.01]Ocean.
[221:19.59]Where are we?
[221:20.93]Okay, right here.
[221:21.95]It's just straight up here.
[221:22.87]Straight up north, right?
[221:25.19]Just gotta get him on a fucking road.
[221:34.45]Can I put him in the trunk?
[221:38.67]Pull him with the opened car door?
[221:40.88]You- You don't fuck this up, lady.
[221:43.68]Oh my god, these fucking idiots.
[221:48.66]I wanna- I wanna pull this lady out of her car and put an axe in her head.
[221:52.54]Go!
[221:53.61]Drive your car!
[221:55.65]Drive the car!
[221:57.45]Drive- Fucking idiots.
[222:04.66]You almost hit me.
[222:07.88]Yeah, they're the idiots.
[222:12.14]What happens if I grab him?
[222:13.84]I'll just pull him there.
[222:15.58]Alright, pray that this doesn't break everything.
[222:18.49]I can't do anything with him anyways.
[222:25.79]This is so frustrating.
[222:33.19]Shut up, lady.
[222:36.85]There we go.
[222:39.28]Give me your fucking car.
[222:42.22]Now.
[222:42.50]This is the definition of insanity.
[222:48.82]Just pretend the stream is over, alright?
[222:50.56]Just pretend the stream is not on anymore.
[222:57.27]And then, like, come back in, like, ten minutes.
[222:59.91]For the climax.
[223:02.01]You'll get a climax on stream.
[223:08.47]Turns are going to be difficult.
[223:14.80]Just pretend the stream is over.
[223:16.14]That's what you can think like.
[223:18.36]No.
[223:20.14]There's a straightaway up here.
[223:21.40]We'll be able to move him pretty easily.
[223:24.76]Bang a left.
[223:27.12]And dump this motherfucker in the ocean.
[223:29.73]And then get a hard EXE crash.
[223:39.81]Here we are.
[223:41.59]Right at the straightaway.
[223:42.73]Now we just go north, just push them the whole way.
[223:50.86]It's a long straight.
[223:59.78]And line it up.
[224:02.26]Come on camera, stop fucking with me.
[224:03.82]There we go.
[224:05.28]Camera, stop doing that.
[224:06.94]Why?
[224:07.74]Why are you doing this camera?
[224:10.26]Stay fucking behind me!
[224:30.35]Every time, the camera just decides to readjust.
[224:38.93]I gotta get him in the street again.
[224:41.49]So it's supposed to be easy.
[224:51.40]Mission failed.
[224:52.14]There's no way the mission is going to fail.
[224:54.04]Because I am in proximity of this guy at all times.
[224:58.18]There we go.
[225:01.38]Keep going straight.
[225:02.00]Alright, what's the best way to get there from here?
[225:07.76]We got...
[225:10.12]Oh, we got a long way to go.
[225:11.60]I'm going to say left and then up that way, like on the highway.
[225:14.59]Fuck.
[225:19.41]Shit.
[225:20.89]Left on the highway and then off the highway.
[225:23.27]I mean, I guess we could go over here.
[225:30.45]Is there a, I don't even know if I can go off.
[225:34.86]I'm not sure if I can even go off the, where's the dock that we drove over before?
[225:42.08]Alright, if I have the waypoint here, is this the dock that I drove off last time?
[225:48.65]Like here, right?
[225:58.30]Yeah, I'm just triple checking this.
[226:02.18]No, it's not like this is not stopping now.
[226:10.24]I beat Sleeping Dogs like an hour ago.
[226:11.88]We tried some of the DLC.
[226:13.19]Now I'm dumping an NPC in the ocean because he broke inside where we were.
[226:20.09]Don't go into the wall.
[226:21.01]Don't go into the wall.
[226:21.72]Don't go into the wall.
[226:23.84]Oh, fuck.
[226:24.32]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[226:25.04]Get out.
[226:26.98]He's gonna seep into the fucking wall.
[226:43.96]Somebody has a pretty good idea here.
[226:45.84]I'm gonna try it.
[226:52.17]I can't.
[226:54.27]They were saying, open the door.
[226:55.47]Just, like, hook him through the door.
[226:57.51]I can't hold it.
[226:58.11]You have to be moving fairly fast to be able to have the door open.
[227:03.71]I can't grab him.
[227:04.79]Grabs do not work on this guy.
[227:06.34]It's gotta be car push.
[227:12.64]Oh, shit.
[227:13.67]Okay.
[227:14.17]Don't get him in front of the trolley.
[227:15.57]That's important.
[227:20.61]We're so close.
[227:21.84]We're, like, we're so there, right?
[227:24.04]Like, it's worth it.
[227:40.13]There we go.
[227:40.57]Ugh.
[227:44.42]We have like a couple more turns and then one more straight away.
[227:48.48]And we're there.
[227:54.53]It's not, but continue.
[228:00.55]Right here.
[228:05.00]What do you mean riot?
[228:05.86]What are you rioting for?
[228:06.76]We have 560 fucking meters.
[228:15.61]Shit.
[228:15.93]That is a lot.
[228:18.31]This... You motherfucker.
[228:23.69]Don't you dare.
[228:27.57]Bus is better.
[228:32.13]Bus is better.
[228:33.48]It's bigger.
[228:38.04]Bus is bigger.
[228:45.68]The wider, the better.
[228:46.36]Except I can't see him.
[228:53.05]Fuck.
[228:54.27]No, this sucks.
[228:55.57]No, this thing sucks.
[228:58.61]Can't see.
[229:02.75]This'll be fine.
[229:05.11]Just couldn't even see over the top.
[229:15.70]Anybody have a timestamp to when we started doing this?
[229:18.46]Like, when did I actually first start to go, oh, okay, I'll go.
[229:23.86]And trying to get him out of the house.
[229:26.48]It's gotta be, I don't care if this takes an hour.
[229:28.42]I really don't.
[229:29.94]I'm gonna be the only person that's ever played Sleeping Dogs and done this.
[229:35.13]That's fine.
[229:39.43]I'll be the only person that's ever played the game to do this.
[229:48.07]That's a fast car.
[229:48.83]I actually kind of want the faster car.
[229:54.46]Can be featured on Kotaku.
[230:00.67]Guy with literally fucking nothing to do.
[230:04.71]Does most boring possible thing.
[230:07.85]For no payoff.
[230:11.05]I swear to God, one of these is gonna be a cop car.
[230:14.49]And... It's gonna cause a huge... Alright, here we go, straight away.
[230:17.35]This should get us pretty good, pretty close.
[230:29.28]Let's go.
[230:31.12]Gotta get him away from the fucking wall.
[230:38.91]Watch the... Don't even... I'm not gonna say anything about games crashing and shit.
[230:44.41]Not a chance.
[230:44.96]It would be funny if the game crashed right now.
[230:57.62]He's not receiving damage properly.
[231:11.25]I love how we couldn't talk to drug dealer.
[231:13.61]So now let's spend an hour putting him in the ocean.
[231:16.39]That's what we decided to do today.
[231:30.64]Gotta straighten him out.
[231:33.89]Get out of the way.
[231:34.47]I don't want to hurt you.
[231:45.34]He needs to be more on the road.
[231:48.72]Need a car with a flat front.
[231:50.10]Yeah.
[231:50.38]Yeah, he's like slipping off this.
[231:53.52]Move!
[231:55.50]Taxicab probably would be pretty good.
[232:01.12]Once we get to the dock, I'm gonna get out of the car.
[232:10.42]Yeah, I need a car.
[232:11.27]Better one than this.
[232:17.48]Seems to be, no matter how slow I drive, he's just always popping off to the side.
[232:21.98]Stop right there.
[232:23.20]You're flat.
[232:24.78]Could use you.
[232:28.10]Gonna steal three more cars before I get there.
[232:45.35]I thought that was him for a second.
[232:46.47]I was about to be like, holy shit, why is he getting hurt?
[232:51.03]Alright, 300.
[232:51.45]Almost less than 300 meters.
[232:54.21]Taxicab's perfect.
[232:57.35]Just get him in the road again.
[233:00.62]What are you doing?
[233:01.36]Alright, get him in the road.
[233:12.89]Stupid fucking sandwich bus.
[233:14.41]Let him go by.
[233:15.05]Alright, this is so much better.
[233:18.23]I can already feel the difference.
[233:25.24]Let's go.
[233:32.37]Almost there.
[233:32.97]We're more than halfway there.
[233:40.93]Can I go straight up here?
[233:42.51]Do I have to follow the... I don't think I have to follow this.
[233:45.39]Do I?
[233:47.79]Can I go straight in here?
[233:53.50]I don't think I can.
[233:56.66]I think we actually have to follow this dumb thing.
[234:04.46]Wait, does it want me to go... What the fuck does it want me to do?
[234:17.28]I'm gonna go around like this circle here.
[234:18.74]Okay.
[234:20.62]So close, guys.
[234:22.26]Almost there.
[234:29.85]Just go.
[234:30.57]I'm trying.
[234:32.97]Get this guy out of the way.
[234:34.82]Come on.
[234:36.78]We're so close.
[234:40.34]It's painfully close.
[234:50.78]Can't go that way.
[234:51.38]I think we do have to actually go around.
[234:52.86]I ain't gonna blow it.
[234:56.52]I gotta get up and move him.
[235:03.46]Manually move him.
[235:04.96]You know what?
[235:05.99]Fuck the car for now.
[235:09.07]I'm gonna manually move him around for a second.
[235:10.79]Just to see what's over there.
[235:21.24]Because there's going to have to be a lot of finesse moves up here.
[235:25.74]Let me just get him in the street.
[235:37.35]Ow!
[235:37.57]What the fuck?
[235:38.95]Okay, give me the taxi again.
[235:46.68]I thought he just despawned.
[235:47.52]I was about to fucking cry.
[235:51.81]Move.
[235:52.91]That's gonna kill him.
[235:53.79]No, it's not.
[235:54.23]Okay.
[235:56.49]It only took us one whole day and night cycle to do this.
[236:14.31]We did it.
[236:15.89]We did it.
[236:16.87]We did it.
[236:17.27]We did it.
[236:17.59]We did it.
[236:22.07]Okay, then it's a left.
[236:28.87]Just like in Dark Souls, Bloodborne, just because you got the boss to 10% health doesn't mean you get greedy.
[236:35.22]Fundamentals.
[236:40.56]Okay, take a right.
[236:59.44]Here we go.
[237:01.64]Time to dump this dude in the fucking ocean.
[237:02.99]Actually, I'm going to get him around the other side.
[237:16.51]Oh, no.
[237:16.79]Okay, I got to get him on foot after this.
[237:28.81]Straight this way.
[237:33.38]No.
[237:33.76]Straight it out.
[237:34.50]Don't be a dumb asshole about this.
[237:41.50]Okay.
[237:42.14]Where are we now?
[237:46.97]Alright.
[237:47.17]We just gotta get him up there.
[237:52.47]Get him up there.
[237:53.97]Move this out of the way.
[238:02.88]We have stairs to deal with.
[238:04.12]It's okay.
[238:07.38]Stairs never hurt anybody.
[238:20.03]We're gonna have to push him up the stairs ourselves.
[238:25.10]Yeah, we're gonna have to do it manually.
[238:26.72]With our body.
[238:31.53]If there's any sign that he's going to get wedged in the stairs, this is a big mistake and it could end very badly.
[238:40.77]The remainder has to be Finesse.
[238:42.65]No more car.
[238:46.11]Wish I had a bike right now.
[238:47.03]I see clipping.
[239:02.43]Oh boy, okay, we're good.
[239:10.90]I can feel it.
[239:12.96]I can feel it.
[239:20.35]There's a balcony.
[239:22.61]We have to get him all the way to the dock.
[239:33.46]Damn it.
[239:34.96]This dude, is that guy just like smoking a joint?
[239:39.50]Alright.
[239:45.06]Look at how close this is.
[239:46.60]Get back in the car now.
[239:47.54]Okay.
[239:48.26]I don't want him to despawn.
[239:51.20]Keep him in view.
[239:56.21]Still in view.
[239:57.67]Don't let the game load a new asset over him.
[240:12.03]We spent this much time.
[240:15.99]I can't afford to lose this right now.
[240:17.28]I'm getting like a police on me.
[240:20.12]Okay.
[240:20.86]Here we go.
[240:22.94]Where's the dock?
[240:23.60]This is... Are there more stairs?
[240:29.19]Oh, fuck.
[240:30.65]Hold on.
[240:30.97]I need to look at this.
[240:36.37]You gotta... Fucking shit.
[240:43.91]This way!
[240:44.57]Alright, I should be able to do this with the car still.
[240:57.16]Because I need the light.
[241:00.38]Yeah, there's a ramp at the end, so this is happening.
[241:13.13]So long I've waited.
[241:18.13]No, no, no!
[241:21.06]I thought he was flying away.
[241:24.50]That's what you have to be careful of.
[241:27.08]We lost access to the car.
[241:30.46]I'm glad the disease got on the car and not on him.
[241:34.18]Looks like it's manual from here on out.
[241:39.12]Down the stairs.
[241:43.14]No other cars here.
[241:53.46]Starting to get, like, fucking anxious, you know?
[241:55.94]I'm starting to really... It's hard to do this now.
[242:02.80]I need a car.
[242:09.69]Shit!
[242:11.31]Move, lady!
[242:14.00]Move!
[242:15.34]Before you get hurt.
[242:16.28]Fuck.
[242:30.69]No.
[242:32.17]There's no way.
[242:33.71]We have to just walk him to the dock.
[242:40.00]We've come this far.
[242:42.48]I can't call a car in.
[242:43.72]There's no contacts.
[242:47.20]Maybe he'll slide down.
[242:51.06]Nope.
[242:55.70]How far away is the car?
[242:56.58]Too far away.
[242:58.02]The final walk.
[243:07.09]Once he gets down here, this shouldn't be that bad.
[243:12.23]We're gonna be able to smell the ocean here, man.
[243:21.68]That was a good movement.
[243:24.04]That was nice and fluid.
[243:25.04]Try to get that again.
[243:29.70]This has been such a pilgrimage.
[243:33.94]Oh, look at it.
[243:34.70]Look at it.
[243:35.18]It's right there.
[243:40.88]Good volley.
[243:41.90]Good volley.
[243:53.89]We went from K-bar all the way to here.
[243:59.15]Look at how much we... Look at... This is not the way to say you can achieve anything you want.
[244:05.65]Whatever your dreams are, achieve them.
[244:10.33]Because we pushed an NPC across the map into the fucking ocean.
[244:20.20]An unkillable NPC.
[244:21.68]And I need to get a good view of this.
[244:23.50]Otherwise, holy shit, what a waste of time it would be.
[244:41.93]Cue some music.
[244:42.88]I can't.
[244:43.18]Nope.
[244:44.58]Put whatever music you want on because I'm not alt-tabbing.
[244:47.38]Because alt-tab, that's adding a small variable to crash the game.
[244:53.55]I've had the game crash like once or twice.
[244:55.63]Alt-tab.
[244:57.23]Nope.
[244:57.73]Not gonna happen.
[244:59.40]Hum whatever your favorite song is.
[245:13.99]Good volley.
[245:14.47]Good volley.
[245:15.03]Good volley.
[245:16.51]Oh, perfect volley.
[245:18.77]This is what it was made for.
[245:20.43]This is what dreams are made of, guys.
[245:22.49]A volley like that.
[245:35.08]Nice on.
[245:39.26]Oh, no.
[245:39.84]Oh, no.
[245:40.04]I'm losing control.
[245:42.20]He's got to go off the ramp.
[245:45.67]Oh, no.
[245:46.19]Oh, no.
[245:48.15]Oh, no.
[245:50.76]Oh, no.
[245:59.54]Oh!
[246:01.74]What are you thinking?
[246:07.13]I can fix it.
[246:07.61]I can fix it.
[246:09.13]Fixed.
[246:28.64]I fixed it.
[246:29.18]Everything's fine.
[246:31.40]Don't do that again.
[246:32.46]Get him far away from that shit.
[246:39.82]He's backing up faster now.
[246:42.32]Alright, this is what it was for.
[246:43.40]We gotta see what happens here.
[246:44.36]This is like an hour.
[246:45.40]This is what?
[246:46.32]More than an hour?
[246:47.56]No.
[246:48.42]Alright, here he goes.
[246:50.58]Get your cameras ready.
[246:51.66]Get your pictures ready.
[246:54.43]I know mine's ready.
[246:55.27]It's currently running.
[246:55.97]Because you're watching it.
[246:58.37]Up the ramp.
[247:16.89]It's too dark, it's too dark.
[247:18.03]Better view.
[247:19.41]We're gonna wait for daytime.
[247:21.30]Oh shit, he's gonna fall.
[247:23.98]I'm waiting for daytime.
[247:26.84]No, he's gonna fall on his own.
[247:30.94]Better view.
[247:58.54]Yeah, we lost.
[248:03.97]What a relief.
[248:06.23]I have like a weight.
[248:07.39]A weight off my shoulders.
[248:20.14]That was not worth it.
[248:22.40]Oh, what do I have to do?
[248:23.08]Converse after?
[248:23.72]This was so long ago, I forget what I even have to do.
[248:29.64]Do it again.
[248:30.28]Push him into your bed.
[248:42.17]No.
[248:42.97]I'm sorry.
[248:43.77]Not happening.
[248:46.19]I think that's it.
[248:47.13]The stream ends here.
[248:47.98]Uh-oh.
[248:59.17]Let me finish the mission first.
[249:00.63]Roll the credits.
[249:01.13]Where are they now?
[249:02.43]Alright, here we go.
[249:03.15]Hey!
[249:03.23]I remember you.
[249:04.41]Wait, hold on.
[249:05.38]He actually leaves on his own?
[249:31.00]This dude leaves on his own.
[249:33.64]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if he tells us to meet him at the dock.
[249:42.63]Please have me meet you at the dock.
[249:46.05]Make this whole thing full circle.
[249:49.55]Meet me at the dock.
[249:51.03]Come on, man.
[249:52.73]Make my whole life worth it.
[249:55.11]My entire life will have been worth living.
[249:57.56]If that's what he says and I meet him up there.
[250:16.54]You think you can fuck with us?
[250:19.60]See what the ocean man The ocean man Where are we gonna head to?
[250:40.15]Where do I catch this guy?
[250:41.37]Why wouldn't you jump?
[250:54.74]I'm doing so bad.
[250:55.74]Okay.
[251:05.02]Get in a car.
[251:07.19]Well, he's stuck again.
[251:19.19]Wait, did he just climb back up?
[251:20.35]He climbed back up to jump down?
[251:30.47]No, he's going into the prison cell.
[251:42.34]What the fuck?!
[251:50.39]I was gonna take him to the ocean again.
[251:59.27]Yeah, I was.
[251:59.95]Yeah, you all saw it.
[252:01.03]I was going to take him to the ocean.
[252:06.33]Get over there.
[252:07.01]Is he going to get stuck again?
[252:10.50]What do you think?
[252:11.06]No, not this time.
[252:29.42]I love how he missed his Q. Alright, get him in the car.
[252:40.24]You're under arrest.
[252:45.99]God damn it.
[252:46.73]Oh my god.
[252:47.67]Where is this?
[252:47.97]Where's the mobile HQ?
[253:09.91]That'd be in the ocean.
[253:14.99]No, it's not.
[253:17.91]Out of the way.
[253:28.21]No, I can't take him to the ocean.
[253:34.89]You understand that it can't happen?
[253:41.25]The ocean's the other way.
[253:42.67]No, he's not going in the ocean.
[253:48.24]I'm trying to shoot this guy.
[253:55.54]Would you fucking flip over?
[254:13.37]Why is everything so awful?
[254:17.52]I'm not dumping him in the ocean.
[254:18.98]Not this far into the mission.
[254:23.46]I don't have to do anything.
[254:37.37]There you go.
[254:40.31]There it is.
[254:41.41]There it is.
[254:41.79]You got it.
[254:59.58]You know he's going to end up in the ocean.
[255:01.06]Doesn't matter.
[255:02.22]Do it on purpose.
[255:04.00]What do you mean do it on purpose?
[255:05.88]What do you think I just did?
[255:12.13]You think that was an accident?
[255:13.41]I drove that dude into the fucking ocean.
[255:23.63]Out of the way.
[255:27.47]That was the wrong ocean.
[255:30.48]There is no... What do you mean wrong ocean?
[255:33.80]There's the Pacific Ocean.
[255:42.07]What do you mean wrong ocean?
[255:43.35]Do you want me to put him in a plane and fly him somewhere else to put him in a different ocean?
[255:56.20]Look how close the ocean is.
[256:02.31]Yes.
[256:04.63]I don't even care.
[256:05.37]I'm not even shooting my gun.
[256:06.31]Alright, yes I am.
[256:13.40]That's getting slightly irritating.
[256:15.71]This car is starting to smoke too.
[256:17.41]Oh no, I'm gonna have to cool this car off.
[256:20.15]What do you do about fire?
[256:21.09]I'm gonna have to put this car out.
[256:24.43]Any close water nearby that I could potentially put out a fire with?
[256:40.51]Alright, here it is.
[256:49.53]Not close enough, sorry guys.
[256:53.91]Not close enough.
[256:57.58]Alright.
[256:57.84]There you go.
[257:20.92]Aim.
[257:21.54]Did you have the same idea?
[257:28.22]Holy shit, they are just throwing bottles.
[257:31.25]Are we supposed to be doing this?
[257:35.11]Are we supposed to be throwing bottles at them?
[257:39.69]Why are these guys doing this?
[257:44.56]What?
[257:52.91]Okay, that was an explosion.
[257:55.93]Something exploded.
[257:59.87]I don't know what that was.
[258:04.19]Oh wait, I guess she wasn't involved.
[258:10.04]That guy's indifferent to me smashing bottles on him.
[258:18.24]What is this?
[258:25.34]What is this thing?
[258:32.71]I am so confused.
[258:47.52]Why'd you do this?
[258:49.20]Why did you throw an explosive device up here?
[258:52.22]Come to the fucking ocean.
[258:59.45]That's not the ocean.
[259:02.39]That's a bush.
[259:08.37]Alright, I think that's it.
[259:10.67]This has been fucking fun, though.
[259:13.82]Alright, guys.
[259:15.68]That's it.
[259:17.68]Stream over.
[259:23.47]We're really close to an ocean, though.
[259:24.71]I'll give you one more ocean throw.
[259:27.42]Um, who do you think deserves it?
[259:28.38]Let's find someone that deserves it.
[259:35.54]Smoking on school property?
[259:38.60]Ocean.
[259:46.51]Straight ahead.
[259:55.04]I can just put this guy in a trunk.
[259:56.32]What am I doing?
[259:59.02]I'm done with you.
[260:04.68]Alright, nah, I'm done.
[260:06.26]I'm not going down that road again.
[260:09.54]This has been... Sleeping Dogs.
[260:12.77]Four streams in a row.
[260:14.61]Had to do an extra one today, but... I'm completely happy with that.
[260:18.75]I was fucking blessed.
[260:23.25]Uh... Highly recommend it.
[260:25.77]It's been fun.
[260:28.44]And again, let's go over just one or two quick things before everybody takes off, which if you did, then that's all good.
[260:37.27]See you soon.
[260:41.49]No stream tomorrow.
[260:42.67]Schedule is changing this week.
[260:44.27]I have a couple of obligations I need to do that interfere with the streams that are scheduled.
[260:51.28]So Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday are the stream days this week.
[260:57.92]See you on Wednesday.
[260:58.72]I'm trying to get a Labo prepared to do a dumb fucking Labo stream probably on Saturday or Sunday.
[261:08.11]So that should be fun, hopefully.
[261:11.03]But yeah, see you on Wednesday.
[261:15.51]Thanks for watching.
[261:16.15]I want to make sure I get the last couple of subs that came in over the last hour or so.
[261:26.08]Since we did all that nonsense.
[261:28.26]So thank you to... Where did we leave off?
[261:34.48]Holy shit, a shitload of people subscribed since like two hours ago.

[262:26.96]Thank you so... Thanks, dude.
[262:28.40]Thanks to you.
[262:29.58]No, thanks, guys.
[262:30.78]All the resubs, all the new subs, you guys are amazing.
[262:34.02]Thank you for... continuing to support this stream.
[262:38.06]You guys are fucking... I hope... I hope you think it's worth your money.
[262:45.73]I appreciate it.
[262:46.31]Thank you, guys.
[262:48.05]Now let's get to the bits.
[262:50.11]We had plenty of bits for today.
[262:52.62]I did some of them as we started, but let's keep going with them.
[262:59.32]This is from... Where are we?
[263:06.22]Where the heck are we?
[263:10.50]Bits, there we are.
[263:11.30]Okay.
[263:11.52]Let me get down to here.
[263:21.24]We had the $50 from Polo Juice.
[263:22.66]Just want to reiterate, thank you for that.
[263:24.72]A lot of money.
[263:26.52]And then we had... Where did we leave off?
[263:31.78]I'm just trying to remember where I stopped.
[263:39.96]Right here.
[263:42.02]So, thank you FlubbaGut for the $1.
[263:43.12]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[263:45.45]We don't even have the goddamn outro screen up.
[263:49.03]What am I, stupid?
[263:53.61]I want to say God of War, but I don't want to say God of War in case I don't play it.
[263:56.39]But God of War is probably the next game for a stream.
[263:59.15]And if it's not God of War, then it might be time to tap into the Dreamcast.
[264:01.57]Nintendo Labo, we're going to do that for at least one day.
[264:22.75]I got the Dreamcast.
[264:23.53]I got a bunch of PlayStation 2.
[264:24.67]There's a ton of things to do.
[264:26.49]And a bunch of recommendations from people.
[264:29.85]So, they will be... There will be a lot to do.
[264:34.93]There is no shortage of stuff to do, for sure.
[264:38.65]But thanks, man.
[264:40.77]Thank you to Ken Dalio for the $1.
[264:44.03]Kermit sounds a bit under the weather.
[264:48.05]Kermit... Everybody can do Kermit the Frog.
[264:53.40]If somebody tells you that... If somebody says that they do voices and they're... They're... They're like a tier of, hey, I can do voices, is Kermit the Frog.
[265:03.68]That's their, you know, the layer of, I can do voices.
[265:06.58]I don't know if you trust that person.
[265:09.62]Because everybody does a Kermit the Frog.
[265:17.18]I do voices!
[265:25.34]I won't be able to watch God of War spoilers.
[265:27.36]Yeah, that's another reason why.
[265:28.46]That's one of those games that everyone's just so excited for and everyone's been so hyped up about over the last few years that I don't know if I want to stream it.
[265:37.87]I feel like it's not like a stream game.
[265:39.63]It might be, though.
[265:43.74]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the 25 cents.
[265:45.34]You never finished the story you were gonna tell.
[265:47.56]Oh, right, about, like, okay, so... Anytime somebody calls... If I get a phone call and I'm sleeping... I don't know why this is the human psyche.
[265:56.37]I'm not sure why we do this.
[265:58.11]But I will answer the phone.
[266:00.03]Let's say the phone call wakes me up.
[266:02.80]Dead sleep.
[266:04.62]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!
[266:09.09]You reach it you grab the phone who's that?
[266:11.65]Oh, it's it's it's Dave.
[266:14.59]Oh, okay Yeah, just slide to answer Hey, man, what's up?
[266:23.25]No, nothing much just hanging out at my house Yeah, I'm just about doing some errands and stuff.
[266:27.49]What do you have to and?
[266:29.21]internally you're like
[266:33.88]I don't know why we do that.
[266:35.88]You're not allowed to be asleep, apparently.
[266:38.40]Sleeping is, like, weakness.
[266:40.33]So if anyone knows that you were sleeping, it's like, whoa, I don't want anyone to know that shit.
[266:45.69]And then, why do we do... Hey, dude, sorry, dude, were you sleeping?
[266:50.27]Nah, nah, man, nah, I'm just, uh, I'm not sleeping.
[266:54.29]Who cares if you were sleeping?
[266:56.01]Does it really matter that much?
[266:57.24]Like, just say you were fucking sleeping.
[266:58.56]I don't know why I do this every time.
[267:05.84]Something about sleep.
[267:06.60]I don't know why we pretend like we don't do it So to move on to that that where that came from is I'm a I've probably told the story before but I'm gonna tell it again because Might be people that never heard it before but I'm sure people did this in the past.
[267:22.95]Let's talk about it again so when I was a kid and by the way speaking of like being a kid I
[267:30.31]What's with that bullshit when I was like 12, 13, 14 years old, and we started school at like 6.30 in the fucking morning?
[267:38.36]What brainless moron thought that was a good idea?
[267:41.66]I hated school.
[267:42.66]I hated high school because I had to get up so fucking early.
[267:45.14]Life was hell waking up at like 6 a.m., 7 o'clock, like going to school at 6.30.
[267:49.17]As a fucking 13-year-old.
[267:51.63]Not cool.
[267:55.06]I graduate high school, I go into college, and then... I hear about all my local towns all starting school at like 8, 9 a.m.
[268:03.06]now.
[268:03.34]It's like, what the fuck?
[268:05.05]Anyways.
[268:06.89]So I would be so late to get up.
[268:09.03]I would have a lot of trouble getting up.
[268:10.35]I had a lot of sleeping problems.
[268:11.67]I still do.
[268:13.19]But so in the morning...
[268:15.17]My mother, I have my door closed.
[268:17.06]My mother would come knocking the door.
[268:18.60]Hey, just want to make sure you're getting ready.
[268:20.02]You know, she'd come in, make sure you're getting ready.
[268:21.74]Like, you've got to go.
[268:22.30]We've got to go in like 15 minutes.
[268:23.93]And I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[268:24.51]Okay.
[268:24.85]I'm getting up.
[268:25.33]I'm getting up.
[268:26.60]And she'd close the door and I'd turn over and I would go back to bed.
[268:30.09]Like five minutes, whatever, I'll be fine.
[268:31.73]I'll just get up and she won't even care.
[268:33.93]And I would hear her coming down the hall five to ten minutes later to check on me how I'm getting ready.
[268:39.91]And yank out of fucking bed.
[268:42.25]Sit on this edge of the bed.
[268:43.67]I've been awake for more than ten minutes.
[268:46.09]Pretend to put a sock on.
[268:48.17]Like, yep.
[268:48.81]She's like, I can hear her.
[268:50.26]She's like three or four more steps.
[268:51.72]One, two, three.
[268:52.50]Door opens.
[268:53.02]Jeremy?
[268:54.00]Yeah, Mom.
[268:54.40]Yeah, I'm just getting ready, you know?
[268:58.16]Oh, cool, cool.
[268:58.64]Yeah, great, great, great.
[268:59.24]Good to see her up.
[269:00.68]She closes the door.
[269:02.32]Go back into the bed.
[269:03.62]Get under the covers.
[269:05.42]Oh, okay, fine.
[269:06.71]Again, five minutes go by.
[269:10.08]Oh shit!
[269:10.50]Oh shit!
[269:11.72]RIP OUT OF BED!
[269:12.48]THIS TIME GET A SHIRT!
[269:13.18]RIP THE SHIRT OFF MY SHOULDERS!
[269:14.50]Hey ma, yeah, I'm just uh, I'm getting, here we are, I just got a shirt on and uh, and like... Parents aren't stupid.
[269:20.34]That's the thing that a lot of us never understood.
[269:23.38]Parents are not dumb.
[269:25.39]If I leave a room, and you have a sock being put on, and ten minutes later, I open that same door, and you're sitting in the same spot, with just a t-shirt on,
[269:38.56]you get out of fucking bed I know what you were doing and then you try to you try to defend the fact that that's not what was happening my mother would be like you didn't even get out of bed and I'm just like what are you talking about I'm up what are you talking about like oh how dare you question me humans are fucking weird man humans are fucked up I don't know what's wrong with us
[270:05.38]Like, you dare question the fact that I was not just sitting on the bed getting ready this whole time?
[270:11.07]That's something about being asleep.
[270:17.41]I hate when people see me sleeping.
[270:19.45]It's weird.
[270:20.65]It's burned into our brain, I think, as humans.
[270:24.65]If I know that somebody's looking at me while I'm sleeping, I can't.
[270:27.99]I can't do it.
[270:29.91]I don't want anyone to know when I was asleep.
[270:31.93]I don't want anyone to know, like, how I sleep.
[270:38.57]That's it.
[270:38.95]You're going into the ocean.
[270:44.08]I will never do a sleep stream.
[270:46.58]You know why?
[270:47.62]I don't care about what you guys have to, like, say about me, or, like, how, like, weird I am.
[270:51.38]I hate that.
[270:52.42]Here's what I'm afraid of.
[270:54.32]I'm afraid of, like, four hours into a fucking YouTube sleep stream, I just say something insane and horrible, and everyone's just like, you can't control yourself, and I don't want to be in, like, a dream and just be like,
[271:09.78]Yeah, yeah.
[271:11.62]Yeah, yeah.
[271:14.04]Yes.
[271:15.52]That's what I like.
[271:18.25]I like when you shove it up my ass.
[271:20.03]Like, I don't know.
[271:20.91]I might say something crazy.
[271:23.42]It's not real.
[271:26.00]But like who knows what the fuck anybody says.
[271:28.14]I used to have a sleep talking roommate that would say fucking crazy shit.
[271:32.81]I don't... Kim's told me that I don't do that.
[271:36.55]Right?
[271:37.67]Kim's told me I don't like talking in my sleep.
[271:39.35]But I have woken up and said stuff like... One time we were talking about Superman.
[271:45.28]And I caught myself talking...
[271:48.69]We were having a conversation and I was falling asleep in.
[271:50.67]Me and Kim were talking, I was falling asleep in the conversation.
[271:53.43]That's nothing to do with the fact that like I... That's nothing to do with the fact that the conversation was perfectly fine.
[271:57.33]I was just really tired.
[271:58.83]And we were in bed.
[271:59.69]And I for no reason said... Yeah, that's why when they load the assets in.
[272:05.66]You gotta get to the point where they load the assets in.
[272:08.60]I have no idea what the fuck I was even saying.
[272:10.56]Absolutely no idea.
[272:11.24]And she was like, what are you talking about?
[272:14.02]I'm like, um, what do you mean?
[272:15.34]She's like, we were just talking about Superman.
[272:19.68]Yeah, I mean, like, Superman... And then I'm trying to justify what I just even said.
[272:27.47]I don't want to have that be, like, a possibility of me saying something fucking that... Something insane.
[272:31.99]I don't like the whole sleep talking.
[272:35.39]I don't do it, but I might.
[272:36.83]That would be the one time I would sleep talk would be on a stream.
[272:39.69]And I would say something crazy.
[272:44.42]No, you'll never get a sleep stream from me.
[272:49.80]You do that too?
[272:50.77]I think everybody does.
[272:51.61]And then you try to play, like, the mental gymnastics to why you said that.
[272:57.87]Like, everyone knows you're full of shit.
[272:59.81]But it doesn't matter.
[273:00.51]It's the same reason why you pick up the phone and pretend you've been awake for six hours.
[273:03.73]It's like... I don't know why... Why are we all so full of shit as people?
[273:07.78]I don't know why.
[273:09.34]It's crazy.
[273:11.24]Anyways.
[273:13.12]With that, let's keep going.
[273:18.24]There's your story.
[273:19.83]Dr. Clay.
[273:20.35]Thank you, Spektag, for the $1.
[273:21.77]You think one day you'll come back to Hollow Knight and finish it.
[273:25.55]As you know, it's one of those hard games you would feel pretty great about beating on stream.
[273:32.46]Uh, no.
[273:34.16]I'm gonna put the nail in the coffin here in Hollow Knight.
[273:38.84]That is one of the best games.
[273:42.14]It's a great fucking game, and there are dozens and dozens of hours of content in that game.
[273:49.84]It is a wonderful experience.
[273:53.61]But I think it's too late.
[273:56.45]I haven't played it in so long.
[273:58.81]I'm so deep into the game.
[274:00.31]I'm like, what, more than halfway?
[274:01.47]Something like halfway through the game.
[274:03.45]And at that point, playing the game for that long, it's expected the rest of the game is going to be as hard or harder than what you just did.
[274:09.54]It would be... It just wouldn't work.
[274:12.42]I'd have to start over again to be able to get back into that.
[274:15.24]Unfortunately.
[274:16.04]Unfortunately.
[274:19.35]Maybe when the DLC comes out, that would be like a reason to do it, but I'm gonna say probably not.
[274:25.65]It's a great game, though.
[274:28.19]I need to find an excuse to play through the rest of it.
[274:30.47]Seriously.
[274:33.00]But, thanks, man.
[274:33.96]Thank you, Polo Juice, for the $1.
[274:35.48]And Polo Juice gave $50 earlier, so thank you for the $51 here, Polo.
[274:42.94]They said, you used to be the young cool thing on YouTube, Jerma.
[274:45.44]Now you're like the old man of Twitch.
[274:47.38]No, I'm not.
[274:49.42]There are like Twitch streamers on this platform that are like 40.
[274:53.56]And they're just fine.
[274:55.37]So don't worry.
[274:55.97]I'm not an old man yet.
[275:00.59]Thank you, bro.
[275:01.11]Look for the $1.
[275:01.85]One of the changes to jermaSnort coming.
[275:03.45]It looks like a red banana.
[275:06.23]Well, that's just my face.
[275:10.42]I'll probably do that over the weekend or something before the stream.
[275:15.16]Thank you, Dneb, for the $1.
[275:18.12]Did you try down on the D-pad?
[275:20.18]Many times.
[275:22.56]Dr. Clay, thanks for the 50 cents.
[275:23.80]If you think Photoshop is crazy, Adobe recently showed a program that can take a sample of your voice and make you say anything.
[275:30.37]I do not believe they were making it public, though.
[275:32.15]To my knowledge, it was only in presentation.
[275:34.95]Yeah, until they sell it for $500 a package.
[275:41.11]That shit's getting, that gets real fucked up.
[275:43.37]I don't know about that.
[275:46.53]Thank you, Zamanreal, for the 25 cents.
[275:48.61]That man loved you, Jerma.
[275:49.67]How could you just break his heart like that?
[275:53.70]He deserved it.
[275:55.40]Dunkey Arisen, thank you for the 25 cents.
[275:56.96]Hey, Jerma.
[275:58.10]I'm going to hit you with a really tough curveball question.
[276:02.70]We don't do curveball questions here.
[276:05.74]You give me decent, good questions.
[276:09.26]No curveballs.
[276:11.00]This ain't live TV, okay?
[276:12.80]It's my TV.
[276:14.63]You understand?
[276:16.57]This ain't... This ain't... This is MY TV.
[276:20.89]Curveball question?
[276:21.97]I can just dodge it.
[276:23.43]Like I'm doing now.
[276:29.21]When is MY TV coming out?
[276:32.39]No, it's twitch.tv.
[276:33.53]MY.twitch.tv See?
[276:42.45]Let's see who's in control here.
[276:45.15]Who's in control?
[276:47.84]Who's doing this?
[276:49.67]Is Twitch doing that?
[276:52.67]Who's doing that?
[276:57.15]Am I doing that?
[277:03.31]Who's doing this?
[277:07.41]See how in control I am?
[277:11.43]I could have anything happen on my TV.
[277:15.77]You understand?
[277:16.89]If I want someone... If I want someone... To sneeze... I just have to snap my fucking fingers... And get... It's that simple.
[277:31.21]I have total control here.
[277:40.14]What was your question?
[277:41.58]I don't even know.
[277:42.08]But thank you.
[277:42.48]Thanks for the...
[277:46.92]Thank you for the I think it was 25 cents.
[277:48.55]Thank you Dunkey arisen again 45 cents.
[277:54.15]Here we go.
[277:55.19]Good Jeremiah.
[277:56.57]I'm about to deal with the devil with you if you go all the way with the ant joke and Actually chug a cup of fire ants on stream.
[278:07.30]I Will agree to stop calling you short Do we have a deal?
[278:15.17]You can say anything you want.
[278:16.73]We talked about opinions earlier.
[278:20.14]Wait, so hold on.
[278:21.64]I have to drink a cup of fire ants for you to change your opinion.
[278:26.28]That's not gonna happen.
[278:26.84]No.
[278:27.86]That ain't gonna happen.
[278:30.34]How about you give me ten grand and you can call me whatever the fuck you want.
[278:36.43]No, we don't have a deal.
[278:38.29]Look.
[278:40.79]Talking about deals.
[278:43.49]You want to make a deal with me?
[278:45.91]You know, who's in control here?
[278:49.49]If I feel like making a deal and watching Deal or No Deal... You see, YouTube... Oh, YouTube has blocked this.
[278:56.90]Never mind.
[278:57.92]Oh, no, it didn't.
[279:00.60]I can decide to do that.
[279:18.85]You wanna talk about deals?
[279:21.63]No, that guy didn't even win the million dollars by the way, he opened up the 25.
[279:25.39]Oh shit, you guys can't hear anything.
[279:27.65]How did you not hear, did you not hear the sneezes?
[279:30.56]Hold on, you didn't hear the sneezes then?
[279:37.48]Well that sure does fuck that up.
[279:39.20]You were supposed to hear this.
[279:46.54]That makes me look like I have no power and no control at all.
[279:50.04]Looks like I'm not in charge.
[279:51.70]How much were you going to give me to drink, ants?
[279:56.98]Hey, thank you, father.
[279:59.06]Geraldi for the 40 cents.
[280:01.74]Have you ever heard or considered the Vampire series for streams?
[280:04.62]Vampire Masquerade is one of my favorite games and I think you'd enjoy it.
[280:07.81]Make sure you get the unofficial patch.
[280:09.11]I already did it.
[280:11.86]I think there are a couple of Vampire the Masquerade Ball videos on the second channel.
[280:17.68]Didn't ever beat the game, but we played it a few streams.
[280:20.18]It was really cool.
[280:21.48]It was fun.
[280:21.94]It was interesting.
[280:24.46]Thanks for the 40 cents, though.
[280:25.30]Appreciate it, man.
[280:27.12]A beer of root.
[280:28.74]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[280:30.78]I watched five ads for you, and I'd do it again.
[280:33.95]Thank you, man.
[280:35.93]Bro luck.
[280:36.39]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[280:37.43]I didn't watch five ads.
[280:39.63]You just dinged me a quarter.
[280:40.75]Thanks, dude.
[280:43.27]Hey, Sprint Snail, thanks for the $1.
[280:44.95]Hey, Jerma, imagine the jokes you can make with a green screen.
[280:47.10]Imagine the jokes.
[280:49.32]Um... I can't get a green screen.
[280:53.75]Maybe I would get a green screen to do a couple of videos, but... I'm not keying out myself in front of a fucking camera with a DXRacer.
[281:03.61]I'm not doing it.
[281:05.01]I'm not doing it.
[281:06.67]I'm not gonna do it.
[281:09.28]Not going to happen.
[281:10.28]I'm not fucking doing it.
[281:12.94]Not going to happen.
[281:19.76]No, I'm not confirming green screens.
[281:21.36]I'm not doing a green screen.
[281:25.91]I could go off about... I could go off right now.
[281:29.75]You want, like... You want, like, the fucking can of pop to come out?
[281:33.49]You want, like, the saber to take the head off the champagne bottle and... I'll do it.
[281:38.37]I'll go off.
[281:43.11]Nah, I'm gonna calm down.
[281:46.15]Thanks, man.
[281:47.59]Maybe you'll see it in some cases.
[281:51.56]Hey bro, luck thanks for the one dollar.
[281:52.86]You're complaining about the keys being feet apart.
[281:55.76]Do you only use one hand while using a keyboard and mouse?
[281:59.02]No, I said the mouse and the keyboard are far apart.
[282:02.99]My left click, which was punch, is very far away from grab, which is F. I have to use two different hands to do melee weapon attacks, melee attacks.
[282:14.42]On the controller, B is grab and X is punch.
[282:18.76]It is the same finger, well the same thumb, not even an inch apart from each other.
[282:24.48]And it's the same series of moves.
[282:26.63]Grab, punch, kick, they're alright there.
[282:30.15]It's not like playing the fucking piano to do a combo.
[282:35.43]I don't want to play the piano to do a combo.
[282:38.01]My thumb can do the work within an inch of each other.
[282:45.40]But thanks, man.
[282:48.34]I don't have two hands.
[282:49.14]No, I don't want to play the piano to do a punch-kick combo!
[282:56.05]You don't have to lift your fingers?
[282:57.95]Yeah, you don't have to lift your fingers to play Mozart either!
[283:09.06]Don't gotta lift your hand!
[283:09.92]To play Mozart!
[283:15.68]If you write on a computer, you get Grammarly.
[283:19.38]I write all day, every day, and Grammarly makes my writing better.
[283:23.87]As a student, I like that it's great.
[283:25.69]It actually is correcting everything as I'm writing it.
[283:28.27]Grammar errors, spelling errors.
[283:29.91]More fucking, like, unintelligent shit.
[283:33.17]Just don't worry.
[283:34.51]Let a computer fucking write your English paper for you.
[283:37.88]Yeah, so don't learn how to type.
[283:39.50]Just cheat.
[283:39.82]Write whatever the fuck you want.
[283:41.10]Throw up on your keyboard.
[283:41.80]Eventually your computer will write the whole damn thing for you.
[283:43.88]You know who's in control here?
[284:07.20]Alright.
[284:07.58]Hey, thanks, man.
[284:12.27]What happened?
[284:14.31]My nose is itchy.
[284:16.57]Where were we?
[284:20.11]There we go.
[284:20.47]Okay.
[284:21.17]Hey, Gabe DeGrossi, thanks for the $5.
[284:22.41]Yo, Jerma, long time, no bits.
[284:26.00]Been busy.

[284:27.36]Keep it up, man.
[284:28.70]Thank you, Gabe.
[284:29.16]Appreciate it.
[284:31.04]Thank you for the $5.
[284:33.42]Thank you Broluck again for the 75 cents.
[284:35.55]Hey man, are you gonna play God of War?
[284:37.51]Maybe.
[284:37.75]It's possible.
[284:40.31]It's a possibility.
[284:42.81]Uh, GamblerGamen, I don't know what, thanks for the one dollar, but I don't, this is like a spoiler, I don't know what this is.
[284:50.49]Oh no, it's a sleeping dog's joke.
[284:52.53]Okay, the dog dies.
[284:54.71]Alright, that's not, that's just, that's just a, okay, sleeping dog joke.
[284:58.37]Got it.
[284:58.59]Thank you GamblerGamen for the one dollar again.
[285:01.93]kitty litter is my goddamn drug well quit snorting so much but don't snort it at all it's bad hey 13th on you thanks for the one dollar big smiley brand slurpy I don't know what that means but thanks a lot big smiley penny kettle thanks for the 25 cents are you aware a real crypto has been made for you bald coin is real and it gains and loses value based on how good your jokes are
[285:32.76]You know, I was wondering, I was wondering today why my Ethereum address was deposited 500 hair coins.
[285:46.71]I think you just told me why.
[285:50.60]Well, uh, I'm gonna go ahead and say, I'm gonna go ahead and say that I am, I am okay with this.
[286:03.41]on the one condition that each one of these tokens is like less than like five hundredths of a cent I'm talking like We're talking like almost we're talking zero value Like is it possible that this could be worth nothing?
[286:24.59]Because what I don't want to have happen is that people like get fucking sucked into like a goddamn like coin scheme
[286:32.96]I am not officially endorsing this.
[286:36.22]This is not... I have nothing to do with this.
[286:40.87]This is at your own discretion.
[286:44.49]Please do your own research and be careful.
[286:46.63]I have nothing to do with this.
[286:52.49]But don't spend any fucking money on this shit.
[286:59.39]Endorsed by Jerma.
[287:00.61]No, is it I have nothing it's I think it's just a little fun project that somebody's doing but My fear is that if it's possible that over the next six months or so it this pot It's not gonna it might not happen, but there's a pot is a two point zero point one eight four five percent Possibility that it could get like abused or out of control and that's what I don't want to have happen
[287:23.67]So if you are listening and you are the sole proprietor of the Baltcoin hair coin, I really implore you to not have these tokens have really any value at all.
[287:39.92]I'm going to open up my fucking Ethereum contract one of these days and I'm going to be like, God, what the fuck has happened?
[287:48.39]These things are gonna... I foresee a weird future where they're like a dollar each.
[287:52.18]Or like four dollars each or something.
[287:53.72]And then like... I'll just dump the market on you guys.
[287:57.06]I will just dump it.
[288:03.89]No.
[288:04.53]I hope that... All jokes aside... You can't control the market.
[288:10.31]I know I can't.
[288:11.03]That's because... You were talking about decentralized.
[288:14.12]I'm one central entity.
[288:16.87]The future is here.
[288:17.77]Yeah, I have no control over this.
[288:20.11]That's what I'm trying to say.
[288:22.43]Hear me out here.
[288:23.87]I have nothing to do with this.
[288:26.28]So, if you're going to do any investments, do so at your own risk.
[288:30.82]Because I have abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with it.
[288:32.90]In fact, I'm just gonna go ahead and say, I don't, don't do it.
[288:37.92]So that means, you know, at least, you know, if anything came back, streamer said don't fucking do it.
[288:43.91]It's not his.
[288:48.06]I mean, I technically do control the market if I'm funny.
[288:51.61]I'm going to have to have a fucking... I'm going to have to have a long string of bad jokes here.
[288:58.09]No, but just be careful.
[288:59.03]I mean, it's supposed to be for fun from what I've gathered.
[289:04.43]I've gathered it's for fun.
[289:05.29]As long as it stays that way, then that's fine.
[289:09.93]But that's all up to you guys.
[289:11.81]It's not on me.
[289:12.67]I have no control over it.
[289:15.50]Anyways, thank you, Penny Kettle.
[289:17.02]Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the $1.
[289:18.40]Jerma, stop drinking piss and just go.
[289:20.24]I can't help it.
[289:24.41]Hey, Mint Ramney, thanks for the $7.
[289:27.34]Just paying my taxes for missing like three weeks of streams and memes for finals.
[289:31.64]Well, I mean, if you don't pay your taxes, you know, it's like compounded like 0.5% interest per month of non-payment.
[289:40.14]So, I mean, I guess it was $5 a few months ago.
[289:42.97]So, you've gotten your compounded interest there.
[289:44.77]You've done a good job.
[289:45.59]And now you're off the revenue list.
[289:49.45]So, thank you.
[289:52.28]Thank you, uh, Miguel.
[289:53.80]Thank you, Miguel, for the one dollar.
[289:55.04]They say... Um... They just say taco.
[290:00.77]Okay.

[290:16.98]Or Tar.
[290:17.36]Thank you, Tar, for the $20.
[290:18.94]Apparently, I have almost 1,000 bits in this channel saved up.
[290:23.58]I wish I had more witty and insightful comments.
[290:25.54]Party100.
[290:26.04]I appreciate it nonetheless, man.
[290:28.44]Thank you.

[290:37.04]Chat has saved 4,000 seagulls.
[290:38.96]Are you proud?
[290:40.18]By the way, still waiting for a bash command to remove the seagulls from the count.
[290:46.31]no no no I'm not going to add I didn't even do that this is decentralized I have no control over the seagulls I didn't make it and I'm not going to add a command to kill animals on the stream like I'm not gonna that's decentralized I have nothing to do with this and I can't condone it I'm not adding a bash command no what are you guys crazy are you guys have you guys lost your minds
[291:20.01]I don't have any control here.
[291:21.25]Hey, Wild, a buddy.
[291:31.52]Thanks for the $1.
[291:32.28]Jerma, stop tasing the Wiggles.
[291:33.50]The children are crying.
[291:35.88]Oh, well.
[291:37.72]Hey, Fred Flintstone.
[291:38.48]Thanks for the $1.
[291:39.24]We make the Wiggles.
[291:43.62]Great.
[291:44.03]I'm not doing it.
[291:44.61]I'm not doing it.
[291:45.33]I'm not doing a Trump slogan here.
[291:48.89]This is supposed to be not a political stream, don't you understand?
[291:52.35]But again, I, no control, I have decentralized this stream.
[291:56.97]I don't know, I have no fucking control over what people say.
[291:59.47]Hey, thank you Crunchy for the, Crunchy Jester for the 25 cents.
[292:08.21]According to all known laws of aviation, there's no, yeah, I read the bee thing from the bee movie.
[292:14.74]Thanks, man.
[292:15.22]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the one dollar.
[292:16.86]Do you know they never let the bees go?
[292:18.38]They call them beekeepers.
[292:20.44]They keep the bees.
[292:23.61]What?
[292:24.09]Also, good luck with Operation Ocean.
[292:25.75]I can't believe that was an hour ago.
[292:27.87]But thanks, man.
[292:28.37]That's hilarious.
[292:32.39]That was happening for that long.
[292:33.43]Thank you, Crunchy Jester, again, for the 25 cents.
[292:35.46]Its wings are too small to get its fat little body.
[292:37.44]It's another bee thing.
[292:38.62]Wild, buddy.
[292:39.30]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[292:40.12]Jeremiah, I know you said you don't like playing games for like four streams in a row, but this has been a treat.
[292:44.24]I didn't know anything about this game before you streamed it, and it was a great time.
[292:46.78]Thanks, buddy.
[292:48.81]Yeah.
[292:50.23]I'm trying to balance the streams out a little bit here.
[292:55.75]And what I mean by that are if I like a game, if I'm actually enjoying a game,
[293:03.08]I'm not going to stop playing it, just because it's been like a couple of streams.
[293:06.88]If I truly am enjoying myself, I'm... I'm not going to think about it anymore.
[293:12.46]I'm just going to do it until I'm done playing it, until I'm satisfied.
[293:17.04]So, if I do like a game in the future, expect something like this to happen again.
[293:27.13]New philosophy here.
[293:30.13]Plus, this is not changing anything about the streams.
[293:32.44]There'll still be plenty of one-off, plenty of not-planned, one-off streams that just happen.
[293:41.28]There'll be a lot.
[293:43.39]Of streams.
[293:44.69]Yeah, we'll go with that.
[293:46.03]Good talk.
[293:48.15]Thanks.
[293:49.53]Good talk, Jeremy.
[293:51.37]But thanks, you dude.
[293:52.57]Thanks, you dude.
[293:53.55]That was Wild Havadi.
[293:58.12]Hey, Smitty W, thanks for the $15, Smitty.
[294:03.00]I'm sorry for suggesting the stupid ocean joke.
[294:05.24]Smitty, first of all, no.
[294:09.05]Do not be sorry for that, because that was a blast.
[294:13.69]Thank you for the $15, dude.
[294:15.91]Thanks, you.
[294:20.31]Don't feel bad about suggesting something fun to do.
[294:25.03]I love that shit.

[294:47.82]This is how the Hong Kong police punish drug dealers.
[294:51.66]They get pushed into the sea over the course of 20 minutes.
[294:56.72]Thank you.
[294:57.08]And Adam for the 25 cents.
[294:58.94]U-turn.
[294:59.40]Tell me how to get to the ocean.
[295:01.44]We just need like eight more people to queue up and be able to tell me where to go.
[295:06.47]D-Jack, thanks for the 25 cents.
[295:07.79]Some people pay $25 a month for this.
[295:12.93]Wait, what?
[295:15.13]For what?
[295:15.53]For like the stream?
[295:17.63]Oh, because we were doing, we were pushing a guy in the ocean.
[295:19.61]It took like an hour.
[295:25.94]I love how Topek comes in with the Jerma Expensive.
[295:29.02]Yeah, I get to do it too.
[295:34.31]Look at that.
[295:38.77]Exclusive Club.
[295:43.27]Thank you to Fred Flintstone for the 50 cents.
[295:49.50]That's true.
[295:50.04]You were right.
[295:50.44]What does unhinged mean?
[295:51.08]Unhinged.
[295:51.30]Who the fuck just said that?
[295:52.34]Oh, okay.
[295:52.71]I clicked this.
[295:53.03]Here we go.
[295:53.43]Mentally unbalanced or deranged?
[296:20.64]No.
[296:21.92]I don't think so.
[296:24.98]That's not me.
[296:30.74]Unhinged.
[296:31.22]That means I'm out of control, which I'm not.
[296:32.98]I'm perfectly in control of this stream.
[296:42.23]I am in control.
[296:44.35]That sounded like me.
[296:52.36]Okay, that was weird.
[296:53.04]You know what I'm saying?
[297:03.12]Fuck you.
[297:06.75]I need to do something here.
[297:21.58]Let's try it.
[297:26.72]No, I'm not signing up.
[297:28.10]Don't give my phone number to anybody.
[297:32.34]The fuck?
[297:34.64]Okay, I gotta get this right.
[297:38.38]So, I wanna say... U.S.
[297:39.06]is gonna be a male voice.

[298:45.78]I appreciate all you being here.
[298:53.24]That didn't work as well as I intended to.
[298:55.55]I'll get it.
[298:58.63]Hey, guys, thanks for watching the stream.
[299:01.45]I'm fucking done with that.
[299:02.53]That sucks.

[300:13.83]I had to turn it off.
[300:18.60]That was the chat.
[300:22.62]That was text-to-speech chat.
[300:25.56]I heard bash.
[300:27.06]Yeah, you did.
[300:28.08]Because that was chat.
[300:32.48]Alright.
[300:32.86]Let me shut my fucking mouth and keep going.
[300:34.76]Alright.
[300:38.04]Lightning round.
[300:41.99]Lightning rung.
[300:42.61]Here we go.
[300:42.87]Again, I'm serious.
[300:45.44]This is just the shit that I used to do on YouTube, man.
[300:47.34]Really.
[300:47.80]Some of those things that you saw on YouTube may have taken like two hours to do.
[301:07.82]Get a guy in the right spot, or get something to happen in the right spot, and spend like an hour or two trying to make it happen.
[301:14.68]A lot of things were very off the cuff, but stuff like that was dead serious.
[301:19.56]If I saw an opportunity like that, I did whatever it took to do it.
[301:24.72]So.
[301:26.70]A little bit of inside info.
[301:29.93]But thanks, man.
[301:30.71]I appreciate that.
[301:31.31]That took 34 minutes.
[301:34.69]God.
[301:39.56]The grenade room?
[301:40.74]If I had, okay, honest to God, if I had streamed Death to Spies, people would have left the stream.
[301:49.57]People would be like, please get out of here.
[301:51.69]Like, this is stupid.
[301:52.97]People would have actually left the stream.
[301:55.17]I would have lost like 700 viewers.
[301:57.09]Because I did spend more than an hour doing that.
[302:04.66]It's actually good that I wasn't streaming really that much back then.
[302:09.31]Because holy shit, people would have thought I was an insane person.
[302:14.11]That is one of the best games, by the way.
[302:15.45]If you've never played it before, just give it a try and love it.
[302:21.87]But, thanks, man.
[302:23.79]Thank you to Manboy for the 25 cents.
[302:25.99]I was watching Infinity War.
[302:27.95]Pretty good movie.
[302:29.09]And only just got here to see you pushing around an NPC to the ocean.
[302:31.56]This is definitely... This is the definition of a Jerma joke.
[302:34.48]10 out of 10.
[302:36.16]Thanks, dude.

[303:13.04]Well, that wasn't true.
[303:15.70]He was broken.
[303:18.13]He was a broken computer program that we dumped into the ocean.
[303:21.47]But yes, that did happen.
[303:24.19]Thank you, 13th Honey, for the one dollar.
[303:25.65]It's been over an hour since I gave you money.
[303:27.22]Here's a dollar.
[303:27.78]Thanks, man.
[303:29.86]Hey, Gambler Gaming, thanks for the three bucks.
[303:32.40]Ocean Man, take him.
[303:36.35]To the land.
[303:38.93]Whatever that means.
[303:39.93]Thanks, man.
[303:41.51]Manboy, thank you for the 30 cents.
[303:43.13]There's a YouTube link and Victory Road, they say.
[303:45.38]Whatever that means.
[303:46.22]Let me pre-click this.
[303:48.00]Oh, it's a Game Boy song.
[303:53.26]It's Pokémon Game Boy Victory Road.
[303:58.53]Oh, that was the song I was supposed to play when we were pushing him up.
[304:00.76]Sorry, I didn't get it.
[304:04.46]Mr. Peanut, thanks for the $1 dunk tank this chump.
[304:08.28]Thank you.
[304:08.82]Thank you, Marble Kid for the 25 cents for the views.
[304:12.80]I'm not even sure that was for the views, because I think we lost a handful of people because it took too long.
[304:19.25]That was just for my own personal... love for the game.
[304:23.23]You know what I mean?
[304:25.37]Hopefully it was enjoyable.
[304:27.70]Hey, Smitty, thanks again for the $7.50 here, Smitty W. You actually put him in the ocean.
[304:32.86]You have made my night.
[304:33.82]Thank you.
[304:36.69]I say what I mean, and I mean what I say here, man.
[304:39.53]If I say we're going to put this guy into the ocean, if somebody says put him in the ocean, and I say I'm going to put him in the ocean, he's going in the ocean.
[304:49.58]You know, make that my political fucking tagline there.
[304:55.25]If somebody says put him in the ocean and I say I'm going to put him in the ocean, that fucking guy's going in the ocean.
[305:01.69]Vote for Jerma.
[305:06.32]Manboy, thanks for the 25 cents.
[305:08.12]Was it worth it?
[305:10.78]Yeah, it was.
[305:12.52]Djack, thanks for the 25 cents.
[305:13.80]He won't be dealing drugs in this town anymore.
[305:16.61]No.
[305:18.49]No, he will not.
[305:20.19]MrPeanut65, thanks for the $1 again.
[305:22.29]That was completely worth it.
[305:24.50]Thanks.
[305:26.40]For spuds sake, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[305:30.78]Yup.
[305:32.22]You did it.
[305:33.39]Congrats.
[305:34.51]With a question mark.
[305:35.51]Congrats.
[305:38.37]Thank you for the $10, dude.
[305:39.89]Appreciate it, for spuds.
[305:41.69]For spuds sake.
[305:43.99]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[305:45.45]The ultimate joke.
[305:46.31]Plus $100.
[305:48.79]That'll get some hair on you.
[305:49.61]That'll get some hair on your chest, right?
[305:51.47]That'll get you some hair coin, whatever.
[305:53.09]It's not supposed to be endorsing that.
[305:55.53]Stop doing that, Jeremy.
[305:57.60]Dr. Clay, thanks for the 25 cents.
[305:59.00]Remember, children, if you work hard, study hard, and always do your best, someday you too can push a guy into the ocean.
[306:09.22]Thank you, Sadad, Sadad, Sadad Cigarette for the $15.
[306:14.94]Thank you, Sadad.
[306:19.04]15 bucks here, man.
[306:20.66]You did it, Papa.
[306:22.30]So proud of you for pushing him all the way.
[306:24.41]Now it's my turn to reach the dock of salvation.
[306:27.45]Free me from my bonds.
[306:30.35]What?
[306:32.05]Thank you, sad dad cigarette for the $15.
[306:34.13]Techno toast.
[306:36.53]Thanks for the $1.
[306:37.11]You did it, Jerma.
[306:37.69]You accomplished your dreams.
[306:38.51]You pushed him into the ocean.
[306:39.35]Take me by the hand.
[306:41.07]Lead me to the land that you understand.
[306:42.73]Ocean man.
[306:43.69]What the fuck is this?
[306:45.47]What is this song?
[306:46.69]Everyone's doing it.
[306:47.49]Ocean man.
[306:52.53]Who is Ocean Man?
[306:54.91]Who sings it?
[306:57.83]Is this like a Led Zeppelin song?
[307:02.31]This is definitely like a Guns N' Roses song.
[307:06.02]Ocean Man lyrics.
[307:07.06]Let's see.
[307:07.50]Let me see if I can get it right.
[307:09.96]Where is that?
[307:10.58]Ocean Man.
[307:10.84]What the fuck?
[307:20.18]Okay, you accomplish your dreams and push me to the ocean, man.
[307:22.66]Take me by the hand.
[307:23.96]Lead me to the land that you understand.
[307:26.04]Ocean man.
[307:26.96]The voyage to the corner of the globe is a trip.
[307:29.34]Ocean man.
[307:30.20]This is like fucking Pink Floyd or something.
[307:31.84]Let's see.
[307:32.44]It's a new kind of network.
[307:55.51]That's from Spongebob Squarepants.
[308:01.53]That's from the Spongebob movie.
[308:07.41]I thought that was like a fucking Guns N' Roses song.
[308:14.49]Or some deep, like, rush or something, you know what I mean?
[308:18.43]Whatever.
[308:25.34]Thank you, Techno.
[308:26.04]Thank you, Djack, for the $1.
[308:27.30]Thank you so much for the laughs.
[308:28.24]That was incredible.
[308:28.86]Thank you, Djack.
[308:30.36]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[308:31.56]They say thank you so much.
[308:32.96]Thanks, dude.
[308:34.66]Corvid Mood, thanks for the $0.85.
[308:35.70]That feel when... That face when... Jerma will never slowly push you into the ocean over the course of a half an hour.
[308:42.41]Feels bad, man.
[308:46.43]Thank you.
[308:49.11]Unkscreen, thanks for the $1.
[308:50.99]Psychostreamer pushes innocent man for one hour into the ocean.
[308:55.38]I mean, that would be a factual statement if you were looking at the screen.
[308:59.16]Gutter Bean, thank you for the $1.
[309:00.60]Ocean Man, yeah, we already X'd out.
[309:07.12]Thank you, Gutter Bean, for your $1 SpongeBob reference.
[309:15.03]And then we had Dr. Clay, thanks for the $0.25.
[309:17.43]Does this mean you don't get banned?
[309:19.41]You just get thrown into the ocean if you violate the rules.
[309:23.81]That is getting banned.
[309:25.25]That is banned from life.
[309:26.55]That is banned from life.
[309:32.33]Thank you, Graveyard Ghoul, for the $5.
[309:33.61]Hey, Jerma.
[309:37.02]Even though I missed the ending of the game, I'm really glad you finally got around to play this amazing game.
[309:42.14]Thank you for playing this.
[309:43.02]I'm so happy to see my favorite tuber of all time play one of my favorite games of all time.
[309:48.79]Thank you, Graveyard Ghoul, for the $5.
[309:49.87]And yes, I'm happy that I finally got around to play it.
[309:55.09]because it is fantastic.
[309:59.67]It was just enough stuff going on, just enough little mini-games, just enough little fun things to keep yourself interested that... I would say... You want a rating for this game?
[310:12.44]I would probably give it a... I don't...
[310:19.49]I can't say... GTA V is better.
[310:22.29]And I only say that because GTA V is a much more expansive game.
[310:25.66]And I like the GTA V world... more.
[310:31.08]Not necessarily the location, but just like the living, breathing world, but that's also because Rockstar had like a hundred billion dollars.
[310:36.75]Uh, if Ro- if GTA V for me is like a 9.7, then... or like a 9.6, then Sleeping Dogs is ha- it has to be like an 8.8.
[310:51.01]Sleeping Dogs is like an 8.7 to me.
[310:54.87]It was really good.
[310:56.57]It was just really good.
[311:00.75]Play Yakuza.
[311:03.99]I'm speaking from total ignorance, but Yakuza felt really small.
[311:08.45]Yakuza felt like a very smushed-in game.
[311:12.73]I feel like this was just better.
[311:16.76]This is what I wanted Yakuza to be.
[311:20.28]Is Sleeping Dogs.
[311:24.05]I might be crazy saying that, but... This is the game that I kind of wanted Yakuza to be.
[311:33.87]That's not to say that Yakuza is a bad game, because it's not.
[311:38.93]I played Yakuza 0, right?
[311:41.56]I streamed it once, just couldn't get into it.
[311:47.72]Warning, this ranking does not contain The Witcher 3.
[311:50.26]Tread carefully.
[311:55.23]ADHD 100 IQ streamer only likes crashing cards.
[312:01.38]No?
[312:03.38]The combat in this game I liked better than... What the fuck is the name of it?
[312:10.24]Yakuza.
[312:12.80]Yakuza was a lot of talking.
[312:14.24]It was a lot of downtime.
[312:15.42]It's nothing to do with crashing cars as much as it has to do with lengthy dialog sequences that aren't even voice acted.
[312:24.66]Like, you know what I'm saying?
[312:27.00]Lengthy, not voice-acted dialog sequences just makes me want to mash A. You can call me ADHD if you want, but it makes me want to mash A. Children also hate long talking.
[312:50.17]He's ADHD up until the point where he gets the opportunity to push a guy into the ocean.
[312:54.17]Then he has unlimited focus.
[313:01.14]What's wrong with being ADHD?
[313:02.68]Nothing.
[313:03.14]I have it.
[313:04.06]I have ADHD.
[313:05.24]Bad.
[313:06.06]Very bad.
[313:10.48]But everyone can have their tastes, you know what I mean?
[313:12.80]It's not wrong to say that I liked Sleeping Dogs more than Yakuza.
[313:16.53]It's just a different kind of game, different play style, different mindset.
[313:22.01]there are plenty of people that love playing battlegrounds games like pub g and Fortnite I for one um would rather eat batteries than play like PUBG for more than an hour that's not that's not saying that those games are not good that's saying that me personally I would rather breathe in
[313:45.10]I would rather breathe in somebody's morning breath.
[313:47.79]I'd rather breathe in, like, some huge fat guy's morning breath.
[313:53.07]As a car freshener.
[313:54.45]You know what I mean?
[313:59.42]Than play Fortnite.
[314:02.00]I'd rather eat bugs than play Fortnite.
[314:05.60]A lot of them.
[314:09.74]It's not that bad.
[314:10.57]I would not rather eat batteries.
[314:19.77]Look, I'm just not into it, but that doesn't mean that they're bad experiences.
[314:30.20]Bugs can be tasty.
[314:32.46]Look, Fortnite's fun!
[314:33.90]Fortnite's a fun fucking game!
[314:36.70]But bugs!
[314:38.41]They're also, they have protein and they're kind of good for you.
[314:41.91]What would you rather do, Jeremy?
[314:45.87]Play this game?
[314:49.81]That launched as a terrible wannabe Plants vs. Zombies fucking Minecraft game?
[314:56.05]That jumped on the bandwagon and fucking... Dropping out of a parachute?
[315:02.32]And sniping people?
[315:04.48]Or eat bugs?
[315:08.32]I don't know.
[315:14.99]I am throwing, like, a lot of shade right now, and I'm, it's, I'm, it's just, it's in jest.
[315:19.33]Look, we're in the game industry together, you know, we like, ah!
[315:21.60]Okay.
[315:22.90]Get Jabby in the rib a little bit.
[315:27.02]Now I have to drink fire.
[315:32.62]Hey, they may have jumped on the bandwagon, but they took care of their game.
[315:36.50]That is something to be said, yes.
[315:39.02]Fortnite did, they, they, they fucking give a shit about that game.
[315:45.58]More so than anybody else in the entire space ever did.
[315:49.65]They really gave a shit about that entire series.
[315:53.05]And they cared a lot.
[315:54.59]So, I guess power to them, you know?
[316:03.63]You're not in the games industry?
[316:06.87]What is this?
[316:07.47]What do you think I'm doing right now?
[316:08.75]What do you mean I'm not in the games industry?
[316:14.44]I play video games on camera.
[316:18.06]Am I... Am I in the restaurant business?
[316:23.39]What?
[316:27.99]Sorry, I thought I was making pancakes back here.
[316:31.13]What am I doing?
[316:35.59]I'm a goddamn journalist!
[316:45.27]Do not call me a fucking influencer, please!
[316:48.11]No, I'm not in the... Don't call me that!
[316:53.85]Fucking influencer.
[317:01.74]Jesus Christ.
[317:04.58]Where did we go so wrong?
[317:08.01]What rabbit hole did we jump down?
[317:17.74]Somebody puked in the rabbit hole, and then let it chill for four years, and then dropped a bunch of straws in there, and a bunch of people clambered over and were like, oh, this is what we want!
[317:27.55]They started drinking the puke out of the fucking cold rabbit hole.
[317:33.51]Hey, you won't, you won't, you won't really fucking pop off here?
[317:39.85]He just compared himself to Christ.
[317:44.76]I did not.
[317:45.94]No, I did not.
[317:47.42]God damn it.
[317:54.68]Unhinged.
[318:02.47]Go to bed.
[318:02.97]It's only like 11.20.
[318:03.63]It's early.
[318:05.51]What is fucking happening?
[318:06.33]What is talking?
[318:08.31]I'm transparent.
[318:09.13]You know what I mean?
[318:10.61]You can see right through me.
[318:13.26]I want to be an open book.
[318:14.72]You know what I mean?
[318:15.96]I want you guys to read this book that I never finished.
[318:19.19]That I wrote like eight pages.
[318:21.87]And lied about it for six years.
[318:24.69]I want you to read my book.
[318:26.03]That's me.
[318:28.22]And I don't want there to be any bullshit.
[318:30.06]I want you to just know it.
[318:41.63]Link it, I'll read it.
[318:43.81]You lied to- I'm just kidding, I didn't lie- Alright, now I'm digging myself my own hole.
[318:50.96]My struggle.
[318:58.07]I want to be an open book and transparent.
[319:00.09]Also, I've lied for six years.
[319:12.52]Uh, yeah, but I want you to, I want to be transparent with the things that I want you to be, see me as transparent.
[319:17.18]You know what I mean?
[319:18.10]I only want you guys to think I'm transparent.
[319:20.32]I mean, I'm not, I want, you know, I want you to open that book and of course some pages have been ripped out.
[319:25.16]So you get to page two and you turn the page and now you're at page like 14.
[319:28.40]I mean, I ripped out like 10 pages.
[319:31.44]That doesn't make me a liar.
[319:32.48]That means I'm just omitting truthful statements.
[319:34.90]I'm not lying.
[319:35.61]I'm just omitting some truths.
[319:41.00]Alright, for the sake of this joke, like, making, like, alright, we're done with this, like, transparency joke.
[319:48.05]I mean, I'm transparent.
[319:49.03]I am.
[319:50.23]That much is clear.
[319:55.91]10 pages in an 11-page book.
[319:58.11]No, I'm sorry, because if that was true, I'd be dead.
[320:02.94]If you, if you, okay, with my story, you're talking about my life, my book, my transparent book.
[320:08.40]If you turn to page 1, and then you page to 10, and then page to 11, if there's only 11 pages in that book, that means I've ripped out my whole life, and it's just me being born, and then me dying.
[320:18.47]That, no.
[320:24.46]Wasn't I reading bits?
[320:25.46]Yeah, we're just fucking talking here.
[320:34.18]Less hair.
[320:35.00]This is without making jokes.
[320:37.32]I'm reading you guys my fucking life book.
[320:44.30]By the way, the book is still being worked on, guys.
[320:46.94]I'm writing like 100, 200 pages a night.
[320:49.52]It's coming along really smoothly.
[320:51.44]I got like maybe 200 or 300 pages done so far.
[320:55.01]I can't wait till you guys check it out.
[320:58.53]Just hang in there, man.
[320:59.67]I'll show you.
[321:00.23]You'll see it.
[321:07.64]Hey, uh... There's another Ocean Man reference.
[321:18.53]Uh, you guys are fucking... You guys are fucking hilarious, really.
[321:23.23]I'm actually George R.R.
[321:24.25]Martin.
[321:26.09]Streamer compares himself to Christ and writes a second Bible.
[321:33.09]Ay-yi-yi.
[321:34.79]Uh, thank you...
[321:37.73]Thank you, The 13th Onion, for the $1.
[321:39.71]Are you hyped for Dark Souls Remastered?
[321:43.71]Uh... No.
[321:47.25]The balloon was sort of deflated.
[321:50.35]When I read and heard about how it's not really actually a remaster, right?
[321:56.48]It's kind of just the PC version of the game.
[321:59.96]That they added a few more textures and just kind of re-released it, right?
[322:04.74]That kind of takes the wind out of the sails.
[322:07.75]No.
[322:08.69]So I'm wrong.
[322:11.43]I'm wrong.
[322:15.12]Didn't we already talk about this?
[322:16.02]I thought everybody said three or four weeks ago that it was going to be just junk.
[322:25.92]There's mods that make it look better than the remastered version even looks like.
[322:32.07]It's portable.
[322:32.75]Yeah, but I mean... It's a remaster, not a remake.
[322:37.10]Isn't that what Prepare to Die Edition was, though?
[322:41.60]I thought the Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition was like the remastered PC version that they put everything in and update up, you know?
[322:50.59]Or is it just like, hey, it's on the Switch now.
[322:52.21]Isn't that cool?
[322:55.31]I'm being hosted by somebody right now?
[322:58.10]Who's hosting me?
[322:58.98]Why are you doing this?
[323:03.60]Am I being hosted right now?

[323:24.52]Thanks for the hosts, guys.
[323:27.54]Appreciate that.
[323:28.22]Uh, let me make this minimized.
[323:34.63]Vinny is hosting me right now?
[323:37.49]That's cool.
[323:37.89]Hey, Vinny!
[323:39.60]Thanks for the host, Vinny!
[323:47.33]Vinny's a good dude.
[323:48.71]Highly... Vinny... Vinny's a guy... Highly recommend that guy.
[323:52.21]You know what I mean?
[323:52.71]If I was to give Vinny, like, a score... Like, we gave a score to Sleeping Dogs.
[323:55.51]Let's give a score to Vinny.
[323:57.87]Um... I would say... He's very cordial.
[324:02.25]He's very well-spoken.
[324:03.23]He's a funny guy.
[324:04.27]He's interesting.
[324:05.04]He does good content.
[324:07.70]I'm gonna have to give him a solid...
[324:12.94]You can't give somebody a 10.
[324:14.04]That's desperate.
[324:14.64]You know what I mean?
[324:15.50]Like, he's a 10!
[324:16.74]He's a 10!
[324:18.12]That means like, oh boy, slow down.
[324:19.56]Pump the fucking brakes, Jeremy.
[324:24.00]You can't give somebody a 10 because then you look desperate.
[324:27.01]I'd give him a 9.5. 9.5.
[324:40.05]rate your friends on stream rate Etalyx hmm can't give him a 10. known for a long time so that's at least two extra full letter grades right so me here's a funny story about me and Etalyx this is a hard this Etalyx is hard to do because Etalyx and I started at like a two I thought he was an
[325:03.55]We were on the Respawn Army together, and he made fun of one of my videos.
[325:07.35]He talked shit about my video that I put on the Respawn Army.
[325:12.37]He was a 2.
[325:14.07]I read that comment, and I'm like, what the fuck is this asshole?
[325:17.75]And then he was like, well, I liked the video, and I was like, oh, okay.
[325:21.59]Alright, he liked the video, but he's a 2.
[325:24.80]And I'm sure I was like a four because he was pissed off because he didn't know who I was and I was getting some attention on the app.
[325:30.18]So he was probably just like, who's this fucking guy getting like 20 upvotes, like fucking loser, like your video sucks.
[325:36.12]We exchanged some words.
[325:37.90]This is a true story, I'm not making this up, this is actually real.
[325:41.19]We actually like got into a little back and forth about like content creation.
[325:45.13]And I like realized he was kind of a smarter guy, he was like a smart dude.
[325:49.84]he had some interesting things to say and then he went from a two to like a four and then We kind of just because we're in the same place.
[325:58.41]We're both trying to get partnered We both really wanted a YouTube partnership and they were really hard to get back then It was very difficult to get partnered on YouTube with like a network Six years ago.
[326:09.27]It was fucking hard.
[326:10.75]So we were in the same boat We started hanging out and
[326:15.07]We both joined the... we started playing the same games together.
[326:18.13]He went to a five.
[326:20.93]And then, you know, I met him in real life.
[326:23.13]I actually met him in real life.
[326:24.43]We went to a couple of events together.
[326:25.69]He went to like a six or a seven.
[326:28.40]And then after that, we got in a big argument and he went to like a seven to like a four.
[326:32.52]Like two years ago, we got in like a big blow-up argument and he went down to like a four.
[326:37.10]And then he slowly crawled his way back up to like a 7.4, 7.5.
[326:41.61]And then we went to the casino together.
[326:43.31]This was a month ago, like, no, this was like a year ago.
[326:48.17]Back in like December, we went to the casino together.
[326:51.29]And we hung out and we had some good times.
[326:53.97]And he went from a 7.5 to like a 7.9.
[326:56.03]And where he stands today, he actually told me that he really, really likes, he really was like into Steins Gate and I'm not.
[327:04.97]So I told him that, you know, that brings him down to like a 7-7.
[327:08.29]But then he loaned me some money.
[327:10.92]He loaned me like 40 bucks.
[327:12.32]So that brings up like a 9.
[327:14.14]Talos is like a 9-5, I would say.
[327:17.26]Oh, is that Vinny?
[327:18.00]Is that Vinny in the chat?
[327:20.88]Oh, give us a shit about a Talos.
[327:22.65]Vinny's here.
[327:24.15]Vinny.
[327:25.09]Vinny, dude, what's up, man?
[327:26.05]How are you?
[327:34.53]Etalyx is a 9.5.
[327:37.95]They're both 9.5s.
[327:39.07]I can't have two 9.5 friends?
[327:41.69]Both funny?
[327:42.59]Both smart?
[327:44.59]Both interesting?
[327:51.53]Etalyx is fucking cool.
[327:53.35]What's wrong with Etalyx?
[327:54.21]He's a 9.5.
[328:03.97]Not transparent at all.
[328:06.03]Yes, I am.
[328:06.65]I'm the most- I'm the most transparent top 1000 streamer on Twitch.
[328:13.17]Between the- okay, you go to Social Blade.
[328:15.60]You got the guy at 900, who's the- who's 900 streamer, and you got 1000 streamer.
[328:21.04]Right in the middle there, you got a tra- you got- I'm probably- I'm the most transparent 950 to 960 streamer.
[328:28.24]I would probably say.
[328:33.10]Alright, I've, like, I gotta, like, read bits.
[328:35.25]What the fuck am I doing?
[328:39.37]What is star?
[328:39.99]Star is zero.
[328:43.79]I would probably put star at zero.
[328:48.11]And then, you know, we started talking, and he's like, I'd put him at, like, a two.
[328:51.76]Maybe, like, a two and a half.
[328:52.62]... ... ...
[329:06.64]No, Star's fine, Star's fine.
[329:08.91]He's a fucking six.
[329:14.39]Now, all my friends are 9.5s.
[329:16.83]They are.
[329:17.21]I can't... They like Pokémon.
[329:20.38]How do you pick a Pokémon that you don't like?
[329:22.80]You don't.
[329:24.18]Eventually, you just, like, throw them in the incinerator.
[329:27.13]They don't lose a rating, right?
[329:30.43]9.5.
[329:30.97]9.5.
[329:31.15]I love my Squirtle.
[329:32.53]He's a 9.5.
[329:33.41]I love my Pidgeotto.
[329:35.25]He's a 9.5.
[329:35.62]I fucking, oh my god, my Charizard has evolved.
[329:39.16]He's a 9.5.
[329:39.52]Ah, I've ran out of room for Pokémon.
[329:42.08]I don't have any more room for Pokémon.
[329:43.38]I can only have six.
[329:45.16]Oh, this one's a 9.5, but I don't have any more room.
[329:47.38]Just burn him.
[329:49.11]Just throw him in the fire.
[329:49.91]Incinerate him.
[329:50.63]He's still a 9.5, but he's been incinerated to make room for another 9.5 Pokémon.
[330:07.98]Pidgeotto doesn't suck.
[330:12.43]No, I kid.
[330:13.09]I'm kidding.
[330:17.09]Thank you.
[330:18.85]Alright.
[330:20.33]Actual lightning round.
[330:21.23]Here you go.
[330:25.16]Oh, man.
[330:25.58]A fucking shitload of people just gave... Was I really just fucking ranting and raving for like 25 straight minutes?
[330:33.62]What the hell am I even doing?
[330:34.66]What have I become?
[330:36.47]I've become one of those ranting, raving old fucks.
[330:41.27]Let me see.
[330:41.85]What does this say?
[330:44.65]What is star?
[330:45.27]Star is zero.
[330:46.11]Oops.
[330:57.08]We're just making fucking jokes here.
[331:07.01]Better than 34 minutes of pushing a guy into the ocean.
[331:15.10]What am I?
[331:15.56]A 5.
[331:16.60]I would make myself a 5.
[331:21.30]Because, you know, look, half the time, I'm a pretty good friend.
[331:25.45]Really good friend half the time, actually.
[331:27.03]50% of the time, I'm a fucking great friend.
[331:30.11]The other 50% of the time?
[331:30.93]Nope.
[331:35.62]But that 50% where I'm a good friend, better than anybody else between 900 and 1,000 streamers.
[331:43.17]Anybody in that sector, that top 1,000, 900 to 1,000, find me somebody else that's a better friend 50% of the time.
[331:58.03]Alright.
[331:58.69]Lightning round.
[331:59.13]We're supposed to be lightning rounding here.
[332:03.03]Yes, I am.
[332:03.71]Okay, here we go.
[332:05.11]Everything that we just said and did for the last 40 minutes, I would like that stricken from the record, not true.
[332:13.19]Clean slate.
[332:14.79]I am excited for the Dark Souls remaster to answer the question that started this 40-minute conversation.
[332:19.35]I don't know how we got here, but yes, of course I am.
[332:21.73]I can't wait to play it.
[332:23.37]I'm gonna play it on stream.
[332:25.37]The 13th Onion, thank you for the $1.
[332:27.83]Also, why is there still no suggestion thread?
[332:29.71]I need to recommend Majesty to you, but I don't have an official channel to do it in.
[332:35.66]Fuck.
[332:36.86]I'll figure that out for the next few days.
[332:38.14]Thanks, dude.
[332:39.68]Hey, yeah, take a look at this frog for a second.
[332:42.00]Hey, man, boy, thanks for the 25 cents.
[332:43.38]Did you screen these bits before reading them?
[332:46.23]They could have been Infinity War spoilers.
[332:47.89]Shame on you.
[332:49.66]I don't.
[332:50.16]I don't screen my bits.
[332:51.74]I mean, I do.
[332:53.40]If you're going to say something just fucking awful or stupid, I'm not going to read it.
[332:57.26]I skip bits.
[332:58.44]I've skipped them before.
[332:59.14]If you're going to try to get me to say something fucked up or fucking awful or just straight up crossing lines, I ain't going to read it.
[333:07.30]I'm just going to skip over it.
[333:08.20]It's not going to happen.
[333:10.06]And your potential couple dollars that you may have, I'm going to get them to say just fucking fucked up.
[333:14.72]No, I'm just going to skip it.
[333:17.04]Transparent, you know?
[333:23.83]Do you scream at your bits?
[333:27.31]You still read them, though.
[333:28.25]I mean, I accidentally do sometimes, because I don't screed them.
[333:34.79]Thank you, and Adam, for the 25 cents.
[333:36.28]Oh, yes, I like it when you shove... Whoa, and we... We were just talking about screening bits.
[333:42.54]Speaking of which, thanks for the 25 cents, Adam.
[333:45.04]I appreciate it, man.
[333:46.34]Zmanreal, thanks for the 25 cents.
[333:47.82]You say crazy stuff when you're awake, though.
[333:50.71]Yeah, but I'm in control of the crazy shit that I say when I'm awake, not when I'm asleep.
[333:55.40]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[333:56.70]Hey, Jerma, if you don't like in-ear earphones, I recommend you try an open-back style headphone.
[334:01.50]Not as isolated and claustrophobic.
[334:03.26]What are you talking about?
[334:04.40]Open-back headphone.
[334:08.91]What are these?
[334:11.93]Open-back style.
[334:12.87]These look... I want these.
[334:15.77]Why did nobody ever tell me these existed?
[334:20.50]Open back style headphones?
[334:26.21]Will that solve my problem?
[334:31.29]Open backs are great, open backs are great.
[334:35.31]When I ever have earphones in, I feel like I'm talking underwater.
[334:41.27]Do me an experiment for me.
[334:43.45]Take both your hands and press them into your ears and start talking.
[334:47.24]It's like, it's like you have water in your ears and it's hard to even keep a conversation going.
[334:51.93]I hate that.
[334:54.13]How did he not know what they were?
[334:57.19]I'm not an earphone expert.
[335:00.47]I'm wearing the same broken headphones that I bought for $100 like four and a half years ago.
[335:04.41]You have the same problem as me, OpenVac solves it.
[335:10.90]I'm gonna sincerely look into that, for real.
[335:14.95]You guys, you may have just changed my life here, for real.
[335:24.43]You can stop covering your ears now.
[335:26.57]What did you say?
[335:27.39]What did you say?
[335:37.54]That was good.
[335:38.96]That was very good.
[335:42.47]Oh, that was good.
[335:43.91]That was funny.
[335:44.73]It was.
[335:45.01]I love you guys.
[335:53.96]You guys are fucking too much.
[335:55.89]Hey, Snoopy, thanks for the five dollars, dude.
[335:58.53]Just, they don't say anything.
[335:59.55]Thanks, man.
[336:01.73]Uh, hey Tara, thank you, uh, god damn it.
[336:04.73]Thank you, Tar.
[336:06.43]Thank you, Tar, for the one dollar.
[336:07.53]I can make you say literally anything I want just by donating a dollar, though.
[336:10.73]I don't know why you need a spooky AI.
[336:15.69]Yeah, but we just talked about it.
[336:16.59]I could just skip over it.
[336:18.23]Dr. Clay, thanks for the 25 cents.
[336:19.53]When you snapped your fingers for the sneeze, I actually sneezed.
[336:23.93]That's right.
[336:25.94]Grizzly1620, thanks for the 25 cents.
[336:27.70]Mustard fact.
[336:28.40]The name mustard comes from the Latin words...
[336:32.57]Mustum Ardens, which means burning wine.
[336:37.90]Interesting.
[336:38.50]Little tidbit there, thanks.
[336:40.60]Hey Spreo, thanks for the $2.50.
[336:42.38]Yo, I missed the stream.
[336:43.20]Could you do it all over?
[336:43.94]Thanks.
[336:45.86]There's a video on demand that will be there very soon.
[336:49.15]By the way, you have two, there's two musics playing at the same time, this whole time.
[336:52.03]I'm sorry that it was, that's probably been jarring.
[336:56.35]Thank you, Spreo, though.
[336:58.51]Thank you, the 13th Onion, for the $1.
[337:00.19]I made the big smiley slurpy comment when you threw him into the ice chipper.
[337:04.68]Oh, right.
[337:06.88]That makes sense.
[337:08.04]This emote is so bad.
[337:09.74]Ban that guy for life.
[337:19.40]You know what?
[337:19.84]No.
[337:20.45]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[337:25.95]Unhinging.
[337:27.75]He's saying, but he's saying a true statement.
[337:30.35]You know what I mean?
[337:31.59]Can I ban somebody for life for saying something that's true?
[337:38.04]And by the way, as we're all aware, banned for life means you're banned, you're timed out for five seconds.
[337:48.79]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
[337:51.81]Okay, I just saw Etalyx actually banned him, and I was like, excuse me.
[337:55.67]I was about to be very upset.
[337:59.73]I just saw the dude got fucking banned.
[338:03.55]Don't ban me, I'm sorry.
[338:04.89]It's a good emote.
[338:08.43]No, banned for life means you are banned for five seconds.
[338:18.92]You know, he spoke the truth, though.
[338:23.11]Etalyx going... Alex is really overstepping his bounds, I think, as a... As a mod here.
[338:28.55]I might have to demod him.
[338:32.25]I unbanned him five seconds later.
[338:34.73]Yeah.
[338:36.45]We'll talk after the stream, dude.
[338:37.65]We're gonna have a talk with you, 9.4 friend.
[338:40.90]Hmm.
[338:47.17]Funny how somebody's rating can go down real quick.
[338:54.83]Well, it's not free, because, I mean, you're giving it to me, but you had to get it from somewhere.
[339:03.36]Now, if somebody gave it to you for free, then you giving it to me would be technically free money, but would you get it?
[339:09.92]Somebody had to have made that money somehow.
[339:12.14]You had to have gotten it from somewhere.
[339:15.07]We can argue semantics here all you want.
[339:18.07]But I will definitely take that money from you.
[339:20.59]Thank you, Dengistown, for the $5.
[339:21.61]Appreciate it, dude.
[339:23.65]Thank you.
[339:24.11]For real.
[339:25.39]Cheese Nuggets, thanks for the 60 cents.
[339:27.11]Hey, Jerma, not much bits.
[339:29.27]But I do want to... But I... Hold on, let me just reboot for a second.
[339:35.57]Hey, Jeremy, not much in bits, but I was going to do this on Friday, so... Shout out to my boyfriend, Chris.
[339:42.84]I love him.
[339:43.50]Happy anniversary and early birthday.
[339:46.33]We both love all your stuff and quote it constantly like it's a religion.
[339:49.79]And bond over it.
[339:51.45]Keep doing you, Jerma.
[339:53.51]And I'll keep loving him.
[339:55.87]You mean so much to all of us Jermamites.
[339:58.95]More than you think.
[339:59.85]Thank you, Cheese Nuggets.
[340:02.26]And, hey Chris.
[340:04.98]Happy anniversary, you two, and happy early birthday.
[340:10.62]Your anniversary gift is me!
[340:13.54]How are ya?
[340:15.33]No, that's very touching.
[340:16.95]Thank you.
[340:18.27]That's incredibly kind of you to say.
[340:21.49]I wish you both the best of luck.
[340:23.87]Hopefully your relationship grows stronger every day.
[340:29.34]Thank you, and of course, happy birthday.
[340:35.18]I'm going to jump out of a cake.
[340:38.00]Thank you, Cheese Nuggets.
[340:38.84]I hope they're still here.
[340:40.60]They did this an hour ago when we were ranting about, like, fucking raiding our friends.
[340:45.51]Are you still here?
[340:46.09]Are you still here?
[340:48.05]They're here, right?
[340:56.65]What if they're not here?
[340:59.62]Are you here?
[341:00.86]Yes, okay.
[341:01.66]Alright, good.
[341:02.46]Yes.
[341:03.72]Okay.
[341:04.60]I was gonna say, that would be...
[341:10.53]Thank you.
[341:13.61]I'm at least glad you got to see it.
[341:16.89]Thank you, Spreo, for the $2.50.
[341:17.89]When are we getting the $10 Bia emote?
[341:20.63]I can't wait for that.
[341:22.01]I actually have to get back in touch with Blordo.
[341:24.83]He is the one making them.
[341:26.45]When we talked about this stuff, like, a couple weeks ago, the Bia emote will be here.
[341:32.17]He's going to be making it.
[341:33.23]I just gotta get back in touch with him.
[341:36.99]Coming soon.
[341:37.55]And the Jax emotes will be here, too.
[341:39.59]And a couple levels.
[341:41.66]Yes, the $10 BI email.
[341:42.76]We talked about it in chat, like, a few weeks ago.
[341:44.64]And, of course, go follow Blordow, go listen to Blordow's music, and go support Blordow's stuff, because he's a talented, talented man.
[341:54.62]Uh, hey, Clink!
[341:55.64]Thanks for the $1.
[341:56.36]Hey, Jerma, I'm feeling incredibly stressed right now.
[341:59.34]Classes have entered the last full week before finals, and I am eating shit in one of my classes.
[342:05.00]I'm supposed to graduate from college, which I won't be able to do if I don't pass this class.
[342:10.00]Any words of advice or encouragement?
[342:15.16]Kind of.
[342:17.06]Kind of.
[342:18.64]And this is kind of bad advice, but it might not be.
[342:27.24]Let me start from the beginning here.
[342:30.74]Um, do you have a class that you are doing very well in?
[342:37.20]If you have a class that you are guaranteed, guaranteed to fucking pass, guaranteed no matter what happens for the remainder of the year that you're going to, you're going to be fine with that class.
[342:50.92]I'm not going to, everything's going to be fine.
[342:56.55]If you can pull focus away from some of the classes you're doing good in, from some of the classes that you're doing well in, to focus completely on making sure that this class is passed for the credits, I would say that would not be the worst idea in the world, in my opinion.
[343:22.96]I'm not a financial advisor, and this is not advice.
[343:32.94]So, if you need to sacrifice some GPA to actually pass and graduate, I'm gonna tell you right now.
[343:46.43]Nobody gives a shit what your GPA was in college.
[343:52.24]Nobody actually gives a shit.
[343:54.86]So, what they care about is the paper.
[343:57.79]You're not gonna go apply for a job and they're gonna be like, Well, um, what did you, what was your GPA last year?
[344:03.46]I don't give a fuck about any of that.
[344:05.58]They really don't.
[344:09.60]But if you have, like, an A+, in something else, and, oh shit, if I, like, don't study for that, like, part of the class, or if I, like, miss, like, something like that, and I bring my grade down to, like, an A, to make sure you can completely focus and concentrate on this one thing to make sure that you graduate...
[344:33.45]Now that is like a, that is an actual like detonation scenario, you know what I mean?
[344:38.87]Like if you have no other options, right?
[344:42.11]If you're like, holy fuck, I got no options.
[344:45.44]I can either fail this fucking class and not graduate or focus on it completely and graduate.
[344:57.03]If you do bad in college, you'll end up making funny voices in front of people for money.
[345:04.40]So that's not necessarily... That's not necessarily good advice.
[345:09.13]Because somebody would tell you... An actual scholar will tell you... Well, yes, make sure you study for everything and get A's in everything.
[345:17.67]But I'm transparent, you know?
[345:19.50]I'm a realist.
[345:21.22]I'm a real transparent realist.
[345:27.96]And if it were me... If it were me... I would focus on graduating.
[345:37.52]And some professors are really... I mean, we're staying on this one for a few minutes, but it's important.
[345:45.58]It doesn't hurt to just talk to your professors.
[345:49.96]It really doesn't.
[345:51.84]If you can explain to some of your professors, maybe they'll give you an extension on some stuff.
[345:58.59]Especially in those classes that you might need to sacrifice.
[346:00.85]You could hit up some of your professors and be like, hey, look, I'm really trying my all, I'm giving it my all, I'm having a lot of trouble in this other class.
[346:07.36]Would it be possible if I could get an extension for, like, even a few days on this project that I have to do for you?
[346:15.18]You would be flabbergasted to know that actual human compassion exists and people actually give a shit.
[346:24.38]So just talking and making sure you talk in a way that's not, you know, demanding.
[346:31.64]Speaking goes a long way, it really does.
[346:36.68]If you got cool professors, even professors that are not so cool.
[346:42.18]The professors at your school will tell you to eat shit.
[346:50.37]But whatever path you decide to take, I wish you the best of luck.
[346:53.09]Hopefully you figure it out.
[346:56.00]And again, I don't want to give you this, like, life advice.
[347:00.50]Because I had lots of fucking problems like that too.
[347:03.40]And I didn't know what the fuck to do.
[347:07.53]But I was up against other strange happenings in my life at the time.
[347:12.45]So I can't really let my experience be your experience.
[347:15.71]But when I was a senior in college...
[347:18.74]Junior into senior year, like the senior year in college is when I started getting the first symptoms of my fucking colitis.
[347:26.09]And I had no idea what the fuck is going on.
[347:29.33]So like senior year for me was like, holy shit, I have a disease.
[347:33.43]And like it fucking blew up my life.
[347:36.45]So I can't give you the advice that I, you know, how I did it.
[347:43.89]But really best of luck to you.
[347:45.23]Hopefully you figure it out.
[347:52.90]I discovered I was a werewolf.
[347:57.46]Am I in a very talkative mood tonight?
[347:59.95]Well, yeah, I mean, I guess.
[348:03.63]He's a diseased streamer.
[348:05.27]I am.
[348:05.79]I am a diseased streamer.
[348:07.35]I am.
[348:10.69]That didn't mean, like, I am.
[348:11.73]I mean, you can be nicer about it, but...
[348:21.51]Do what I did and transfer to an art degree.
[348:26.22]It might be too late, though, to do something like that.
[348:27.86]What was my degree in communication?
[348:38.04]Communication.
[348:39.06]And you better believe that I was communicating with those professors.
[348:42.63]To be like, hey, I can have an extension on that exam.
[348:53.77]An influencer degree.
[349:00.57]What was my GPA?
[349:07.99]Total transparency here, guys.
[349:10.89]Probably like 2.8.
[349:13.69]Like 2.8.
[349:14.39]I didn't make Dean's List, ever.
[349:16.09]I think it was like 2.8 or 2.9 was my GPA in college.
[349:24.53]It's just like C. It's like a C+.
[349:27.92]What is a 2.9 GPA?
[349:28.64]Let's see.
[349:31.28]I think 2.5 is a C.
[349:34.28]2.9 GPA.
[349:37.16]It's a B. A student with a 2.9 GPA has attained the equivalent of a B. Pretty average.
[349:52.26]It's enough to graduate.
[349:55.38]2.8, 2.7, 2.9.
[349:55.66]It's... Piece of paper.
[349:58.93]The piece of paper was mailed to my address.
[350:04.33]I got two of them.
[350:09.92]B-list celebrity.
[350:12.62]I'm supposed to read bits.
[350:14.38]Turn this off.
[350:15.46]We're talking here.
[350:18.24]Where do I hang my degree?
[350:19.24]It's funny you say that because I actually don't know where it is.
[350:22.24]I have no idea.
[350:25.70]It was hanging in a room in my old house.
[350:30.97]And after I moved, I don't know where the fuck it is.
[350:34.29]I have no idea where my college degree is.
[350:38.93]Whoops.
[350:46.03]I have the gamer, yeah, I have the Blockbuster Gamer Championship plaque, but not my college degree in my house.
[351:05.00]Jesus Christ.
[351:07.80]That's unbelievable.
[351:09.60]Yeah, that's funny.
[351:10.18]I could tell you exactly where that plaque is right now.
[351:13.35]Not my college degree.
[351:18.99]Alright, let's go.
[351:19.67]Speed round.
[351:20.25]Lightning round.
[351:22.11]Thank you, Spreo.
[351:23.19]Thank you, Clink.
[351:24.42]Again, good luck to you.
[351:25.68]I hope you do well in your classes.
[351:27.44]For all luck, thanks for the $2.50.
[351:28.40]$2.50.
[351:28.62]You're going to go back to Monster Rancher 2 or even Monster Rancher in the series.
[351:33.72]Did you even buy it yet?
[351:35.82]The answer is no, no, and no.
[351:39.10]No, no, wait, no.
[351:40.44]The answer is no, yes, and no because we'll be playing Monster Rancher 4.
[351:43.70]We're going to try it at some point.
[351:46.50]Not soon, though.
[351:47.40]At some point.
[351:48.92]Thank you, Dr. Clay 999 for the 25 cents.
[351:50.90]Sorry for the B jokes.
[351:51.70]Not sure why I wanted to keep doing that.
[351:53.04]It's alright.
[351:53.50]It was funny.
[351:54.46]Novi, thank you for the $3.33.
[351:55.72]Hey, Jerma, watched one of your old videos today and totally forgot you're used to beatboxing your videos.
[351:59.98]So when are you going to beatbox one of our sweet skills?
[352:02.92]Show it on Twitch.
[352:04.12]Have you gotten rusty?
[352:04.98]Definitely really rusty.
[352:06.24]I don't think I can do that right now.
[352:08.87]You'd have to give me a minute.
[352:09.63]You'd have to give me like a few minutes.
[352:11.19]And by a few minutes, I mean like a couple thousand minutes.
[352:14.59]Maybe I'll pull it out one day.
[352:15.57]But thanks, man.
[352:16.19]Thank you for the $3.33.
[352:18.85]Bro luck thanks to the 250.
[352:20.19]Where is the text-to-speech streaming coming in?
[352:23.71]I will never stream with text-to-speech.
[352:25.90]Ever.
[352:27.48]You'd have to... You know, I would do it for a million dollars.
[352:32.16]That's way too much money.
[352:33.20]No, whoa.
[352:35.30]I would do it for like 10 grand.
[352:38.35]I would turn on text-to-speech if a guy opened up my door right here behind me and just gave me 20 grand.
[352:46.07]And he was like,
[352:48.92]Turn on text-to-speech tomorrow.
[352:51.42]I'd be like, okay.
[352:55.65]For a million, that's way too high.
[352:58.85]The best I can do is $5.
[353:01.69]Hey, thank you, Novi, for the 33 bits.
[353:08.27]Poseidon is pleased with you.
[353:09.35]Thank you.
[353:10.99]Thank you, ActualDragonTears, for the $1.
[353:12.83]Just got back from work in time to catch the end of your stream.
[353:14.73]Couldn't catch your Saturday stream because of prom, but hopefully...
[353:19.47]I'm actually able to watch a full stream tomorrow.
[353:21.86]Oh, I got bad news for you.
[353:25.32]Changing the schedule this week.
[353:26.32]We're going Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday.
[353:30.02]Sorry.
[353:31.18]Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday.
[353:32.12]Same times, but just different days.
[353:33.90]Got some stuff to do over this week.
[353:36.68]So I gotta stream it out.
[353:38.50]Space it out.
[353:39.20]I'm sorry.
[353:41.46]But actual Dragon Tears, thanks again for the $2.
[353:43.26]Well, guess I'm out of luck till Saturday.
[353:44.92]So here's some more to make up for my missed days.
[353:49.54]Thanks, Dragontears.
[353:50.78]Thank you.
[353:51.02]Appreciate it, dude.
[353:54.64]I missed days.
[353:57.14]You guys act like you owe me money.
[353:58.54]You're like, what?
[354:00.34]Thank you, though.
[354:01.68]Broluck, thanks for the $1.
[354:03.56]Hyperfocusing is a function of ADHD.
[354:06.41]It's very real, and I'm sure you've experienced it.
[354:08.11]My friends and family never understood it.
[354:11.43]See, this guy gets it.
[354:13.34]You know, sometimes I can just fucking see numbers.
[354:15.08]I can just feel them.
[354:15.90]You know what I mean?
[354:16.32]I can just feel them.
[354:16.90]I can see everything.
[354:17.74]I can fucking, I can, my emotions, I can see them and I can feel them and I can focus completely.
[354:23.26]And I, I do so well sometimes.
[354:26.56]It's just, you get so woke for like 10 minutes.
[354:31.49]You can solve anything in like 20 minutes and then it's gone.
[354:38.01]Hyper focusing.
[354:39.33]Bro luck gets it.
[354:42.95]Thank you, Glyphbin, for the $1.
[354:44.29]Speaking of bugs, you know that you can buy cricket flour.
[354:46.51]It's really... It's all just... It's really just mostly dry cricket, ground-up crickets.
[354:57.97]I don't want to eat cricket flour.
[355:00.03]I'm sure I couldn't tell the difference, though.
[355:01.85]Rudolph, thanks for the 25 cents.
[355:03.89]Jax, author, journalist.
[355:05.95]Christ himself, the answer may surprise you.

[355:12.52]You did a good job decentralizing your friends.
[355:18.44]Asian Turtle, thanks for the 25 cents.
[355:20.66]Z-Man Real, thanks for the 25 cents.
[355:22.34]Tell Etalyx to dab, please.
[355:23.74]Etalyx, dab.
[355:25.33]Garfield...
[355:27.15]Where the fuck have you been?
[355:28.13]Get spoilers in here.
[355:49.37]Okay.
[355:50.21]I'm curious, what are your feelings on Disney?
[355:53.89]Personally, I'm looking forward to Wreck-It Ralph 2.
[355:56.83]Well, Disney is like the EA of movies, right?
[356:03.66]They're the big ones, they make everything, and they fucking make a shitload of the same thing.
[356:08.56]But it's going to be interesting because Disney is about to push out its first ever R-rated movie.
[356:15.48]That's Deadpool 2.
[356:17.38]Deadpool 2 is a Disney movie.
[356:19.58]Do you know that?
[356:22.12]Here comes the first ever R-rated Disney movie.
[356:26.69]Gonna be interesting.
[356:33.49]Yeah, Disney bought the rights to 20th Century Fox.
[356:37.86]So now that's a Disney movie.
[356:47.48]Have fun.
[356:49.56]Not technically the deal hasn't gone through completely, but it is.
[356:54.67]What is the first R-rated Disney movie?
[357:00.63]They made The Fly?
[357:07.79]The deal's going through, guys.
[357:12.41]If you think that deal's not going to happen, you're sadly mistaken.
[357:17.18]Disney gets whatever the fuck it wants.
[357:21.08]Guys.
[357:22.04]Guys, Disney bought Star Wars and then shot George Lucas out of a cannon to space and then made an android of him.
[357:29.90]They get whatever the fuck they want.
[357:42.45]They put George Lucas in like a space shuttle and were like, yeah, we'll see you in like, you know, two months.
[357:47.82]And he was like, wow, I can't believe Disney's paying for me to do like a Mars trip.
[357:51.40]And they're like, yeah, we'll see you in two months.
[357:53.20]And what George Lucas didn't understand is two months on Earth.
[357:57.34]Yeah, that's like 40 years in outer space, man.
[358:01.38]He took that deal and there he goes.
[358:08.87]Hey, thanks.
[358:09.85]Thanks, though.
[358:12.56]Thank you.
[358:12.90]How to get dressed well for the $1.

[358:33.11]You guys know that the mission to Mars is, when you go to Mars, that's it.
[358:42.22]If a human being were to get in a shuttle right now and travel to Mars, how long does it take to get to Mars?
[358:50.39]It's like 40 years.
[358:51.03]300 days.
[359:10.45]oh well hey you win some and you lose some you're misremembering planet of the apes right now am I actually doing that am I blending fiction with reality right now I'm blending the planet of the apes and how long it takes to get to Mars in real life holy shit

[361:05.73]Funny thing about prom, actually.
[361:07.01]I didn't get home till 3.
[361:08.11]I had to get up at 7 the next day for work.
[361:11.18]Life was pain, and I wanted to die.
[361:13.30]I didn't even go to my senior prom.
[361:15.50]I don't even know what that's like.
[361:17.58]I don't even know what senior prom is like.
[361:19.24]I didn't go.
[361:19.90]I got fucked over on my senior prom.
[361:25.74]Didn't even go.
[361:26.22]I saw all the pictures of all the people in the ballroom with the big gowns and the suits.
[361:36.25]I didn't go.
[361:36.67]I was too busy grinding my gear in Fortnite.
[361:46.38]Hey, Sam, and thanks for the 25 cents.
[361:47.84]Holy shit, just spent the entire weekend trying to fix my computer and it's working.
[361:50.80]Hi, guys.
[361:51.92]Computers suck.
[361:53.33]Don't ever use them.
[361:55.23]I, for one, can't wait for the resurgence of the newspaper.
[361:58.43]And the stick.
[362:04.25]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the 25 cents.
[362:05.91]As I said last stream, sad to see this series come to an end.
[362:09.12]But we all had a great time watching you and I'm sure you had a great time playing.
[362:12.52]Besides, if things never ended, then new things could never begin.
[362:15.74]That's true.
[362:18.23]For creation, there must be destruction.
[362:23.09]Who said that?
[362:23.75]Is that real?
[362:26.59]For creation, there must be destruction.
[362:37.48]Did I just quote Dragon Ball Z?
[363:18.62]Apparently, Beerus says this, apparently.
[363:25.36]Is Beerus a guy in Dragon Ball?
[363:30.56]Oh, shut up.
[363:35.67]Whatever, I'm not watching a 45 second ad for a 10 second video.
[363:39.58]Anyways, that's going to be the end of the stream.
[363:41.88]That's how it ends.
[363:43.36]See you later.
[363:44.02]I'll see you on Wednesday.
[363:44.98]No stream tomorrow.
[363:51.08]See you on Wednesday.
[363:53.94]For creation, there must be destruction.
[363:55.34]Sounds like a supervillain quote.
[363:56.68]Also, I mean, I think that was in Dragon Ball Super.
[363:59.62]One of the recent episodes.
[364:00.46]Yes, it was.
[364:01.32]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for your 50 cents here.
[364:04.74]And then Garfield, the Monday Killer, with one last quote.
[364:09.93]25 cents.
[364:10.87]Woodstock is dying, Jerma.
[364:12.25]It's urgent.
[364:12.71]He can't make it to the end of the VOD.
[364:14.55]Any Muppet will do.
[364:15.45]Okay.
[364:17.88]I missed my senior prom too, Jerma.
[364:19.68]I was too busy competing in an acting competition while being afflicted with pneumonia.
[364:23.64]Luckily, the girlfriend was competing as well and keeping my spirits up.
[364:26.72]That's good to hear.
[364:28.04]So... Nah.
[364:28.70]This...
[364:38.50]I'm smarter than the average bear.
[364:40.44]That's not Fonzie.
[364:41.69]That's Yogi Bear.
[364:42.67]Good night.
[364:43.05]I'll see you on Wednesday.
[364:52.81]Did I say Fonzie?
[364:54.13]Fonzie the bear.
[364:54.82]I fucked it up.
[364:56.86]Just good night.
[364:58.46]I'll see you on Wednesday.
[365:26.72]Thank you.
