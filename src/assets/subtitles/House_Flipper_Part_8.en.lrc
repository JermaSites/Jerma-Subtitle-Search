[00:05.03]Jerma shield.
[00:07.21]What if I... Maybe I should just do that.
[00:10.26]There hasn't been a new emote on this channel in a year.
[00:13.86]A paid one.
[00:15.70]I've always made it various forms of attacking and defending.
[00:19.54]You guys could just kill each other in chat.
[00:22.59]You guys could have giant medieval wars.
[00:29.77]violence medieval violence oh I didn't say hi hi hi everybody welcome to the stream good to see you we want the dump truck I'm gonna make you guys wait for the dump truck I said this weekend but it was a lie everything I say is a lie 99.9 of all the germs that come out of my mouth are a lie
[01:03.92]You motherfucker.
[01:08.48]How are... How is the virus you downloaded?
[01:13.41]It's pretty good.
[01:15.05]Hey, thank you, John Cena is killed.
[01:17.69]For the five community tips.
[01:20.71]If you don't know, in pre-stream... Something wild happens in pre-stream chat every day.
[01:25.63]Sometimes pre-stream chat is more wild than pre, than post, than, than, uh, Western Pennsylvania is the most God-loving, uh, patriotic part of America.
[01:42.91]Um, current stream chat.
[01:53.10]Current stream chat.
[01:55.82]You did this joke already.
[01:57.22]It's, I love it.
[02:02.36]What I'm saying is, pre-stream chat usually has something crazy going on.
[02:05.48]So why don't you just hang out there?
[02:09.14]And I know that, look, I know there's like a little, oh, pre-stream chat versus Discord users, like LOL.
[02:14.74]I'm a pre-stream chat user.
[02:16.08]I'm not a Discord user.
[02:17.22]I don't go to the Discord.
[02:19.39]Or like all those plebs in the pre-stream chat.
[02:23.63]They're not in the Discord, are they?
[02:26.84]Look, you don't have to have two completely set.
[02:28.42]You can all act as one, right?
[02:34.58]Where do I stand on that matter?
[02:35.92]Where do I stand on that issue?
[02:38.30]Well... Western Pennsylvania is the most god-loving... Alright, we're gonna play House Flipper.
[02:50.81]The DLC came out.
[02:53.83]Stop doing that.
[02:55.33]If you don't know what that is, I can't even explain it to you.
[03:02.63]The DLC is Cyberpunk.
[03:06.03]I think they made this DLC because... Cyberpunk is coming out and they just, I guess, want people to download this too.
[03:16.83]They even say in the patch notes...
[03:19.51]I know you're really excited for a game that's coming out soon.
[03:22.67]So are we.
[03:23.51]So here, download this too.
[03:25.35]I mean, it's pretty... It's actually called the Cyberpunk DLC.
[03:33.92]Oh.
[03:36.12]Look, that's fine.
[03:37.76]They're jumping on a little bit of a trend here.
[03:39.88]But House Flipper is one of the best games ever released.
[03:43.72]So... Like, that's fine.
[03:46.39]That's okay.
[03:46.93]I'm okay with that.
[03:53.31]I won't be able to play Cyberpunk 2070.
[03:54.99]I don't even know if I'm gonna play Cyberpunk.
[03:59.23]It took me like a year to watch Infinity War.
[04:02.15]I don't know.
[04:02.43]I feel like it's something I... Everybody's gonna be obsessed with it.
[04:05.25]There's gonna be memes everywhere that I'm not... I don't even want to look at them.
[04:15.96]Is it weird that, like, there's so much excitement around it that, like, I'm losing excitement because I know that there's so much excitement around it, and I know that if I'm not as excited as everybody else, that I'm going to get let down because I'm not as excited?
[04:28.87]That's not even a hipster thing.
[04:29.89]I think I just... I don't want to be so excited for something.
[04:37.37]That's contrary.
[04:38.13]No, no, I didn't say the game was not going to be good.
[04:39.75]I just said, like, it's...
[04:43.10]It's like, okay, if like God was, okay, if we heard that God was going to open the clouds in a week and talk to the people.
[04:51.35]We all knew it was going to happen.
[04:53.33]God in the fucking sky was going to part the clouds and be like, ladies and gentlemen, it's me.
[04:57.62]And everyone's waiting like, holy shit, here comes God.
[05:02.92]And a week goes by.
[05:04.72]And everyone's outside with their binoculars.
[05:06.70]Here he comes, it's the day.
[05:08.17]And like the clouds part.
[05:10.47]It's like, holy shit, everybody, like, everyone's holding their hands, it's God!
[05:14.31]And it's like a, it's like Mr. Peanut, it's like a peanut with googly eyes.
[05:18.23]Like, falls down, like, into the, like, into the stage.
[05:21.14]And it's like, it's me, everybody, Mr. Peanut!
[05:23.76]And I was like, oh, is that real?
[05:26.76]It's God!
[05:27.92]It's me!
[05:30.10]I don't want you doing any fucked up stuff anymore!
[05:33.92]Like, oh, you're supposed to have, like, a big beard, and, like, huge, like, Zeus with lightning bolts and stuff, oh, that's cool, but...
[05:40.58]You're a peanut!
[05:41.08]Is that a South Park joke?
[05:48.02]It's a Family Guy joke.
[05:49.92]It's a Simpsons joke.
[05:51.60]That was a South Park episode.
[05:52.90]That was a Family Guy episode.
[05:54.80]That was on an episode of Friends.
[05:59.61]I actually, I was, I was actually talking about this.
[06:02.25]Like, when are they gonna add Ross from Friends?
[06:05.71]To, like, Smash Bros.
[06:08.19]Or, like, Mortal Kombat 11.
[06:12.86]They so, they so badly want to put, like, every TV show, the Ninja Turtles are in Smite now.
[06:16.68]Can you imagine his intro, like, and he throws up, like, the, here's, like, my invitation.
[06:31.34]He's already in.
[06:32.12]Alright, let's play.
[06:32.78]Let's go.
[06:33.14]I'm already ready.
[06:37.31]Wait, can I get, I could get DMC'd for that?
[06:42.30]No, I couldn't.
[06:43.06]If I went... Is that... You just triggered it.
[06:51.52]Did I try?
[06:54.55]Alright, if this part of the VOD gets muted, then we all have to laugh about this, like, tomorrow.
[07:01.59]Let me see if I can get this right.
[07:02.47]This is gonna be hard.
[07:04.17]So... Everybody likes to sing this first part, because it's, like, the one that... Hey, look at how good of a singer I am.
[07:11.65]So...
[07:13.86]So no one told... No, I'll get it.
[07:17.23]So no one told you life was gonna be this way.
[07:21.57]So no one told you... I would laugh so fucking hard if that actually got claimed.
[07:31.01]If it does, if it does, if for some reason that could happen, fuck this whole thing, right?
[07:37.72]If it gets claimed.
[07:38.34]Like, who cares?
[07:39.38]I literally just said like four sentences.
[07:40.92]I said like a sentence back to back.
[07:49.53]If you could get claimed for, like, humming a fucking song... When are they gonna start, like, bolting our chairs to the ground and putting fucking VR headsets on us and, like, no, you stay in there and just enjoy... Enjoy the virtual world.
[08:08.48]Don't say anything.
[08:09.10]Don't do anything.
[08:14.76]It's a Black Mirror episode.
[08:16.42]They did it on South Park.
[08:17.38]Yeah, okay.
[08:18.00]Who cares?
[08:21.12]Let's go.
[08:22.64]Why is there no audio?
[08:25.04]You guys hear anything?
[08:28.02]Oh, shit.
[08:28.90]Okay, that was really, really odd.
[08:31.44]I don't hear anything, right?
[08:32.67]And then I went... It's like somebody's, like, walking in my room.
[08:40.95]Making too many South Park references.
[08:42.83]Get him.
[08:43.91]Sneak in.
[08:44.35]Alright, so this is the DLC.
[08:47.59]Thank you to, uh, what's the name of the website that I got this from?
[08:54.33]I don't know.
[08:56.65]The name of this save file is the website name where I downloaded it from.
[09:03.55]I didn't even explain that, by the way.
[09:04.68]Okay, so listen.
[09:06.10]So in pre-stream chat, I've realized that when I reinstalled Windows, I, well, that I lost all of my save data.
[09:15.80]No, no, no, no, no, stay.
[09:18.53]And I couldn't get the cloud to download anything.
[09:23.19]I gotta turn this shit down.
[09:23.97]It's gonna be so loud.
[09:26.09]So I couldn't get... I couldn't download my cloud save.
[09:28.79]I don't know.
[09:29.05]I have no idea why.
[09:30.48]Right?
[09:34.08]So I had to go on the internet and download a fucking save file that had all this stuff unlocked.
[09:40.00]What is that?
[09:40.28]Is that music?
[09:42.18]Yeah, the Family Guy house is gone.
[09:44.22]My garden house is gone.
[09:45.44]Let's take a look in here though.
[09:46.78]Alright.
[09:49.08]This is the cyberpunk house.
[09:53.83]I'm just waiting to look out this window and like... Bang!
[09:57.39]It's a bird, like a seagull that smashes Keanu Reeves' face.
[10:00.79]Hey!
[10:02.93]See you next week, man.
[10:09.22]Oh, this is gonna be so satisfying.
[10:10.44]Hey.
[10:10.52]Hey.
[10:10.78]Hey.
[10:11.06]Hey.
[10:22.41]Yes.
[10:24.93]Yes.
[10:29.33]This is the kind of YouTube video that I watch.
[10:31.11]Those of you that are saying, why do you watch, like, would you watch woodcutting videos?
[10:35.93]Yes.
[10:37.35]If there was a I clean windows video, I would watch it.
[10:40.39]These are kids videos.
[10:49.52]No, there's no surprise eggs.
[10:55.48]And those are stupid.
[10:56.38]This is cool.
[10:57.08]This is adult surprise eggs, okay?
[10:58.84]Don't you guys agree?
[11:06.87]Like power washing videos, it's like, oh yeah, really get in there and like get that, get that grout.
[11:12.11]Oh yeah, get the grout, man.
[11:13.71]That's the same thing as open that thing.
[11:16.19]Open it.
[11:16.88]Oh, Spider-Man's in there.
[11:17.84]Yes, open another one.
[11:19.52]How is it different?
[11:29.64]Humans are so... We're just like a couple of math problems up there.
[11:37.02]Everybody likes stuff like this.
[11:38.37]It doesn't matter.
[11:39.15]It's just different versions.
[11:40.13]Are you high?
[11:46.79]No.
[11:47.91]What?
[11:48.37]Are you?
[11:54.78]I'm not high.
[11:56.16]I swear to God.
[12:01.32]I am not.
[12:01.94]I really am not.
[12:03.06]Stop it.
[12:04.32]Stop it.
[12:05.64]Stop it.
[12:05.88]You're freaking me out, man.
[12:08.26]I'm not.
[12:08.68]I'm not.
[12:09.22]You're freaking me out.
[12:10.04]Stop.
[12:10.26]I'm going to turn this stream off, I think.
[12:12.52]You're freaking me out.
[12:13.16]I'm freaked out.
[12:13.90]What the fuck, dude?
[12:17.50]I thought I was just looking outside of my own apartment window.
[12:20.16]What the fuck, man?
[12:21.38]You guys are freaking me the fuck out.
[12:27.21]No one told you life was...
[12:31.23]Gonna be DMCA'd.
[12:33.13]Let's try to get the whole thing muted.
[12:49.32]It's like these record companies are stuck in second gear.
[13:10.26]-2, stop.
[13:13.04]Come on, I'm making like a fun DMCA joke.
[13:18.94]You don't think that's fun?
[13:21.80]Don't stop.
[13:27.64]These windows are so big.
[13:30.65]I really don't like windows like this.
[13:34.46]I'm sorry.
[13:36.84]There has to be a curtain here.
[13:39.58]The amount of times that I've passed out on my couch just naked.
[13:45.51]Everybody can just look into your entire house.
[13:47.53]I don't want you to see me cooking macaroni and cheese and shit.
[13:49.95]Get the fuck out of here.
[13:54.79]Who wants to be watched eating a box of pizza?
[14:04.12]Everyone's like, oh wow, look at all this open light.
[14:06.87]Yeah, that's cool.
[14:07.99]For like 10 minutes, close the fucking blinds.
[14:09.99]I don't want people looking in my house, looking in my apartment.
[14:16.41]Oh shit, I gotta get even higher up.
[14:20.83]First of all, hold on, let's take care of these wires.
[14:22.37]What kind of soda is it?
[14:29.89]Why are you always naked?
[14:33.14]Aren't you, uh, that's the way humans are supposed to be.
[14:38.82]I swear to God, I am not high.
[14:41.08]I don't, I don't even want to get into this.
[14:43.83]I don't even want to get into this.
[14:48.87]Let me clean this shit up.
[14:50.07]Why is it so dark in here?
[14:51.01]That doesn't turn light on.
[14:57.27]This is just like what's behind every streamer.
[15:08.13]They have, like, all these cool things in the background.
[15:10.23]Just, like, the lights and, like, blinking things and shows and stuff.
[15:14.05]I need one of those.
[15:22.04]Oh, the lever?
[15:24.88]Wait, why did that just turn on?
[15:27.82]Wait, I didn't even do anything.
[15:31.30]Chill.
[15:35.26]This is not... That looks bad.
[15:38.25]This apartment is from, like, 2100.
[15:42.18]They have an air conditioner from 1980.
[15:43.48]Interesting.
[15:46.42]Look at the fridge.
[15:47.90]Look at this, like... And then, look, you got, like, a grandma radiator.
[15:55.20]Oh, turn that off.
[15:56.32]Horrible.
[15:58.66]It's vintage.
[15:59.40]No, vintage in 2100 would be, like, 2150. 2050.
[16:09.99]You can sit in the gamer chair, too.
[16:11.13]Alright, clean this place up.
[16:12.19]Hold on.
[16:14.07]Just delete.
[16:14.47]I don't want, like, toxic waste in my room.
[16:18.46]Why are these here?
[16:20.98]Why would you have that in your house?
[16:27.54]That's because it's punk.
[16:29.94]It's punk?
[16:31.81]Wait, is it- Maybe it is a YouTuber house.
[16:33.75]Because what the fuck do these people even do with all this slime video shit?
[16:39.75]It's just a ton of slime videos.
[16:43.84]What do you actually do with that stuff?
[16:46.92]So they make the slime video.
[16:48.08]They make like five tubs of slime.
[16:49.82]Then what do they do?
[16:50.82]What do you do?
[16:52.42]Where does it go?
[16:52.94]Do they just throw it away?
[16:55.84]Do they pour it down the drain?
[16:56.86]Isn't that like horrible?
[17:05.25]They sell it in smaller quantities.
[17:08.31]Sell it?
[17:19.35]They, they, they slime tube.
[17:21.75]I don't, what do you mean they sell it?
[17:23.88]What does this say?
[17:24.32]I don't know, get rid of it.
[17:26.38]I don't want it.
[17:28.62]I have to make my cool gamer apartment.
[17:30.56]I'm actually into this.
[17:31.42]Alright, hold on.
[17:32.50]Sell the pizza.
[17:33.80]Sell the pizza.
[17:36.36]Energy drinks, disgusting.
[17:41.05]By the way, stop drinking those.
[17:42.69]Just please, just don't drink them.
[17:43.83]Just stop drinking them.
[17:46.37]Just not, don't do that anymore.
[17:48.07]I'm serious.
[17:56.38]Don't stop doing that Says the guy who drinks truly no no no no let me let me let me correct that Says the guy who drank truly one time ever in his life on stream or off stream Because he got so involved in the idea that it might be funny if he drank them on stream that he ruined his reputation
[18:22.00]That's the only time I've ever consumed one of those.
[18:24.76]Ever.
[18:25.30]I've never, only ever.
[18:29.76]Old, old, old.
[18:33.19]This is trash.
[18:34.21]This is like junk.
[18:37.97]Okay, is this even a sink or is this a big fake wood sink?
[18:43.63]This is wood.
[18:46.85]Get rid of this.
[18:50.73]It's not futuristic?
[18:53.85]How is that futuristic?
[18:59.63]Cold, cold plus ice, water, temperature, temperature in a jar, fridge mode, thermometer mode, or shopping mode.
[19:11.90]What kind of fridge is this?
[19:21.56]Alright.
[19:24.17]What else?
[19:24.45]We've got an empty container of takeout container.
[19:29.39]This property needs to be cleaned up.
[19:30.57]What do you think I'm doing?
[19:31.43]How do I get up there?
[19:34.62]Oh, I can just fly up here.
[19:36.00]Alright, here we go.
[19:39.74]Put it in fridge mode.
[19:40.78]Your milk is boiling.
[19:44.58]I only buy shelf-stable milk.
[19:47.83]So, okay, kid.
[19:50.91]I only buy shelf-stable milk, like shelf-stable almond milk.
[19:55.95]Shelf-stable.
[19:59.91]Hey, you know, those of you guys that are from England, all you English, isn't that, don't they keep milk like room temperature or something?
[20:09.18]Isn't like milk in a box?
[20:10.88]You know, the drinking cold milk is weird to Europeans, right?
[20:19.53]Isn't it?
[20:19.75]Oh, that's France.
[20:28.14]There's a European country that thinks that Americans drinking cold milk every day is just weird, right?
[20:43.54]Putting eggs in the fridge, omega-low.
[20:45.68]Right.
[20:50.65]Boxed long life milk exists.
[20:52.43]Yeah.
[20:52.53]Why does everybody think I'm so weird?
[20:57.17]This is like a thing.
[21:06.23]You are.
[21:06.75]I am not even weird.
[21:08.01]I'm not.
[21:10.67]I talked to my mother on the phone last night.
[21:13.22]She told me I wasn't.
[21:15.04]She said I was perfect.
[21:16.06]I was a perfect special boy.
[21:18.30]I said thank you mom.
[21:20.72]So sorry, my mother knows more than you.
[21:22.68]This is after I told her that I peed all over my iPhone.
[21:40.11]Oh my god, I have to get mad about this.
[21:42.71]I am very mad.
[21:43.95]Very, very, very mad at Apple.
[21:46.34]Apple, that's right.
[21:47.96]I'm coming after you with a little bit of a fucking problem here.
[21:51.70]A little bit of a rant here.
[21:53.22]So did you see what they announced?
[21:55.02]You see they announced the iPhone 12 mini.
[21:59.03]The little phone, the little fucking phone that I talked about how badly I wanted.
[22:02.87]They made the iPhone SE.
[22:03.75]Okay?
[22:03.85]Okay?
[22:07.29]iPhone SE was a iPhone 4 chassis.
[22:12.71]Right?
[22:13.39]They come up with the iPhone SE 2.
[22:14.87]Uh, we're not going to make it that smaller chassis anymore.
[22:18.03]It's now a big chassis.
[22:19.11]Okay, well, what the fuck?
[22:20.81]I got that one.
[22:21.31]That's what I got.
[22:21.87]I got an iPhone SE, the new one, because that's the smallest they're ever going to make it.
[22:24.83]Then, these fucking goddammit, they made it a tiny phone.
[22:28.47]They made the little one, that iPhone 12 mini.
[22:31.41]Why did you do?
[22:32.25]I just got the SE.
[22:33.39]What the fuck are you doing?
[22:39.93]Why did they make the iPhone SE 2 bigger, but the iPhone 12 now has a mini version?
[22:49.17]Why did they wait so long to announce that?
[22:50.61]Like, why didn't they announce that shit like a year ago?
[22:52.85]Like, what the hell?
[22:53.63]I'm so annoyed by that.
[22:56.03]First world problems.
[22:59.01]Yeah, I'm just saying, like, why would they do that?
[23:01.77]They came out with the SE, and then they'd be like, oh, by the way, here's the little one that you wanted.
[23:07.21]And that's, by the way, it's like, it's like 1100 bucks.
[23:11.53]I don't even know how much it is.
[23:12.19]It's probably that much.
[23:15.47]Are they just trying to bleed out just phones?
[23:18.39]Just have a trickle of new phones every three months for people to buy?
[23:25.32]Is that the plan?
[23:32.28]It is.
[23:33.68]When I saw that, I was like, I can't even believe it.
[23:41.56]How have you not realized that?
[23:43.00]No, I mean, I'll... Ooh, I like this little place.
[23:48.04]Except I don't like all these.
[23:49.36]I actually hate these signs.
[23:52.10]And they're everywhere.
[23:55.00]The amount of those, like, chill, good vibes, relax, love, eat, play, relax.
[24:03.69]Like, what, is this a Dave and Busters?
[24:05.79]Why do we have to have signs that say, like, oh, eat, relax, play, game on.
[24:14.63]No, get rid of these.
[24:15.83]I don't want that.
[24:20.27]Chill.
[24:22.01]It takes up so much.
[24:22.77]You could put something, a big cool painting here.
[24:25.37]That's what I'm going to do.
[24:28.11]Is there a mirror?
[24:33.41]Eat and then sleep.
[24:34.65]Imagine just having one that said that.
[24:40.36]I'm just having one that just says, I am alive.
[24:44.66]That's it.
[24:44.98]Ooh, a little shoe rack.
[24:55.49]This is cool.
[24:59.99]Did I clean the whole place?
[25:02.61]I did.
[25:02.93]Oh, shit.
[25:04.39]This is, like, almost over.
[25:08.31]This is like almost done.
[25:10.53]I almost beat the level, and this is the only level that exists.
[25:12.99]Looks like we're gonna have to go back to the, uh, oh, the Family Guy house.
[25:16.26]Wait, we can see with the, this save game company.
[25:19.32]The DLC's almost over.
[25:20.32]It was free though, let's be clear.
[25:25.76]What about the toilet?
[25:26.54]Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[25:33.76]Is mold everywhere?
[25:37.19]Oh, this is good.
[25:37.65]Alright, what else?
[25:38.15]What's dirty over here?
[25:38.83]There's new items, too.
[25:41.43]I'm not giving up.
[25:47.41]He hates free DLC.
[25:48.73]No, I just... I'm making a... I'm making a point.
[25:52.69]iPhone 12 mini.
[25:53.79]Get the fuck out of here.
[25:54.89]Like, come on, man.
[26:01.26]Okay, I have a question.
[26:02.32]If I went into like the Apple store and I said, hey, I broke my iPhone.
[26:07.61]My iPhone's broken.
[26:08.27]I have like Apple Care.
[26:09.57]I can get a new one, right?
[26:12.27]Can I like get a new one?
[26:13.75]Can I like get a new Apple Mini for free?
[26:16.56]Is that how that works?
[26:19.42]Well, that depends.
[26:20.34]What happened to it?
[26:21.12]I dropped it downstairs.
[26:22.68]Oh, wow.
[26:23.52]That's exactly what we cover.
[26:24.56]Yeah, I dropped it.
[26:25.22]It fell down the stairs and went crashed.
[26:27.69]See, look at the broken screen.
[26:33.35]Are you sure you didn't piss on it?
[26:35.13]No, no, no, no.
[26:36.01]Of course not.
[26:36.45]Why would I?
[26:36.75]That's disgusting.
[26:37.53]No, I didn't.
[26:40.51]You're trying to give me a piss phone?
[26:43.18]No, no, of course not.
[26:44.32]Of course I wouldn't.
[26:47.00]I gotta move this.
[26:53.34]Oh, shit.
[26:54.48]No, what?
[26:56.96]No, I have to... Every individual book has to be moved?
[27:01.62]Oh, my God.
[27:08.13]Just burn them.
[27:09.34]I can't... No, I gotta get rid of my Funko Pop collection.
[27:28.50]This is a lot of books.
[27:32.86]How many of you guys are like me?
[27:34.72]Where, uh, you have like four books that you've owned for ten years and you may have read the first four pages of one of them.
[27:43.45]I don't know how, people, there's a lot of books.
[27:47.99]Okay, what's dirty?
[27:49.99]What's dirty back here?
[27:50.63]Nothing?
[27:50.89]I mean, this is, this washing machine is pretty, where's the dryer?
[27:55.69]I don't have a, how do I dry my clothes?
[28:04.17]Alright, well we don't need this anymore because I don't have any more books.
[28:10.08]Wait, you put the TV above the washing machine.
[28:16.74]Uh, that's, that's, this seems terrible.
[28:21.96]No, that's got to move.
[28:23.66]That's got to move.
[28:26.44]And the couch is facing this way towards the staircase.
[28:34.36]Um.
[28:37.93]That's an odd design.
[28:42.05]TV on the stairs.
[28:43.39]Yeah, we're going to have a little TV station over here.
[28:45.62]Wait, dirt.
[28:51.08]It's called House Flipper.
[28:55.58]I know.
[28:55.83]We're going to get something better.
[28:59.47]That doesn't match anyways.
[29:00.37]We need something... We need something metal.
[29:05.43]Like stainless steel floor, apparently.
[29:07.59]Is this steel floor?
[29:09.65]It's like aluminum floor.
[29:17.77]Shit, I gotta get up there.
[29:18.53]Can you play the arcade machine?
[29:21.91]I don't think you can.
[29:23.71]Maybe I should just make this place an arcade.
[29:26.96]I just sleep up here, and then I charge people to like come into my apartment Almost come on.
[29:39.50]Where's this last piece?
[29:41.90]No, I don't want to move this.
[29:44.14]I will if I have to.
[29:45.02]Wait, here we go Not again No, I'm gonna actually make an apartment this time
[29:56.73]This doesn't work in here either.
[30:04.82]Kappa.
[30:05.18]Why is it already capping?
[30:06.04]Kappa, Kappa, Kappa, Kappa.
[30:08.68]For what?
[30:10.18]Yeah, this has got to go too.
[30:11.30]Like, get out of here.
[30:13.22]If that's where the washing machine is going to go, then the desk has to move somewhere else.
[30:16.22]Upstairs.
[30:17.42]No, it could stay there, but that... Yeah, that's not going to be there.
[30:30.49]I feel like this is taking up a lot of space.
[30:40.50]Rip apartment.
[30:41.62]What do you mean rip apartment?
[30:44.78]This scares the shit out of me too.
[30:45.78]I feel like at like 2 o'clock in the morning I'm gonna walk through here and this thing's gonna just like chop my like fucking nose off.
[31:00.92]That's not what I said.
[31:03.16]Okay, everything's clean.
[31:05.80]Now I need to furnish and move some stuff around.
[31:08.10]Let's move some shit around.
[31:08.92]I don't even know what this is.
[31:11.78]What's the practicality of this thing?
[31:12.82]Get rid of it.
[31:13.82]I don't want this.
[31:14.68]That's a laptop.
[31:18.07]A laptop with a... Holy shit, that's awesome.
[31:22.29]Did they make those?
[31:24.61]Little tiny extra monitors?
[31:28.51]They don't make those?
[31:29.93]Well, they absolutely should.
[31:31.17]That's a really good idea.
[31:33.55]Little pop-out monitor.
[31:41.21]It would be like a second and third monitor.
[31:43.13]You could put little things on it.
[31:44.11]Like if you're working on a project or something.
[31:48.97]I actually like that idea.
[31:52.19]And they could go in, right?
[31:53.39]They could fold kind of into the top of the laptop.
[31:57.59]That'd be pretty cool.
[32:00.51]But for what?
[32:03.71]I don't... Because sometimes you want to have like more than... Oh, well, never mind.
[32:06.93]I don't need that.
[32:11.57]Alright.
[32:11.81]Well, then explain to me why you need this.
[32:14.73]Those of you that are saying, oh, I can't believe he wants like a small extra screen on his laptop.
[32:21.96]So why would there be seven or eight fucking monitors?
[32:28.04]Stocks.
[32:36.41]For Zorn.
[32:41.11]Oh, yeah?
[32:42.72]You're gonna have eight different windows open for Zorn?
[32:46.20]You sure about that?
[32:48.92]Because, uh... Nancy and Greg in apartment fucking... Floor fucking 20, apartment A... Can see what you're doing in here.
[33:01.45]And you're sure you want to do that.
[33:09.47]One for Zoom calls.
[33:12.37]I'm going to sit here and I'm going to really try to figure out what I would do with this many monitors.
[33:14.93]Okay, here we go.
[33:16.41]I have three, by the way, right now.
[33:20.54]So this is like the main monitor where you do all, okay, like let's say you have like a game or a project or one.
[33:26.70]Okay.
[33:28.96]Okay, let's say this is like chat.
[33:30.74]I just have one monitor for chat typically and maybe like a preview window.
[33:34.21]Okay.
[33:34.33]Okay.
[33:36.06]Other monitor is for miscellaneous, like if I have a YouTube video or something that I need to grab quickly, it's on monitor three.
[33:45.58]What would go on the other ones?
[33:47.08]Okay, so you have necessity, practicality, and fun.
[33:52.55]Okay, let's just say that there was porn on this one, okay?
[33:55.11]There's porn all over this one.
[33:58.65]What do you do with these ones?
[33:59.67]Okay, now let's say there's stocks on this one.
[34:01.43]There's like a few stock tickers.
[34:04.97]let's just say let's just say let's just say let's just say right now I know I said that a lot what about this one music why can't you have music on this one just minimize with like a Spotify playlist you don't need to you need a full monitor to listen to music news feed I need to see the queue
[34:29.49]So you, okay, let me, you want to see the queue for Spotify on a full monitor with it powered on 24-7 while you're here.
[34:38.89]How much does Spotify cost a month?
[34:45.74]What is it, $10, $20 a month?
[34:50.44]It's $10 a month?
[34:52.30]How much does it cost to leave a computer monitor on 24-7?
[34:54.50]Monthly, you think?
[34:55.02]$2 a month?
[35:01.10]Maybe $1 a month?
[35:02.51]$2 a month?
[35:07.33]Are you paying like 30% extra for your Spotify playlist, essentially?
[35:12.35]Nothing.
[35:12.61]I don't pay my electricity.
[35:16.36]Okay, well, I don't know how old you are, but eventually you're going to.
[35:21.98]Wait, do you have like solar?
[35:23.10]Are you one of the houses that has solar that always talks about, I haven't paid electricity bill in four years, dude.
[35:30.15]I got solar.
[35:33.29]You are?
[35:33.59]Oh.
[35:35.49]God, that makes me jealous.
[35:41.23]Yeah, my electricity bill last month was $2.
[35:42.87]Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
[35:48.31]Fuck.
[35:51.41]Can't you get, like, paid to have solar and, like, energy producers, too?
[35:59.56]Yeah.
[36:01.64]Electricity is dirty.
[36:02.54]Yeah.
[36:02.82]Alright.
[36:03.06]Well, when are we going to move away from like tubes that push gas into your house?
[36:06.72]I'd be happy about that one.
[36:08.20]I don't like gas.
[36:08.94]I hate it.
[36:09.54]It's scary.
[36:12.84]Right now, there are a series of tubes that are pushing gas into your house.
[36:16.92]Just it's waiting, just ready for you to call it in.
[36:18.90]It's like, wait, it's like, come on, call gas into your lines.
[36:26.51]Right now, there's like bubbling, burning hot oil just sitting somewhere in a tank, just like, I'm ready to explode!
[36:33.46]Somewhere in your house.
[36:40.84]Bed sucks.
[36:41.70]Actually, this bed's pretty good.
[36:42.53]That was... I'm sorry, I can't help it.
[36:48.95]I just did, I know, I didn't mean to.
[36:54.43]Okay, I've been picking up the same items and putting them down.
[36:56.97]Let's get some... I see dirt.
[37:03.21]Okay.
[37:04.65]Very important.
[37:05.15]Let's get a couch.
[37:08.95]I added a bunch of new items, too.
[37:11.35]This is cyberpunk only.
[37:13.63]Bathroom.
[37:14.16]A cyberpunk bathroom?
[37:17.76]A Denton shower?
[37:25.86]This looks unsafe to me.
[37:27.34]I feel like this thing is going to close me in and just kill me.
[37:39.03]Yeah, I want that shot.
[37:39.91]We're going to have to cyberpunk this thing.
[37:41.73]Cyberpunk is coming out in a week or so, man.
[37:45.73]I'm wicked excited for it.
[37:46.85]I'm not going to play it on this stream.
[37:48.13]You probably won't see it ever.
[37:49.98]Let's go!
[37:50.64]Hype for Cyberpunk 2077!
[37:57.05]I might though.
[37:57.47]I don't know.
[37:57.85]I'm thinking about it.
[38:04.07]Let's go.
[38:04.51]You think it's a game that I would like?
[38:07.71]Oh, shit.
[38:20.38]You can't even leave.
[38:21.17]Yeah, you can.
[38:25.45]You know...
[38:26.56]I used to have a fridge that was like this, where it was way too big for the space, but they got it in, they put it in, and I was like, I don't even want to go through the trouble of having you take it.
[38:43.33]So, I don't care.
[38:45.67]It's a little too long, but I don't care.
[38:51.91]I guess I could crush the walls, but I can't crush this wall.
[38:54.83]This place is not big enough for me to build a big one.
[38:59.34]We got a link?
[39:04.92]I don't understand.
[39:06.20]This is Elbertson's class.
[39:07.94]What the fuck are you doing?
[39:16.09]Okay, we have our shower.
[39:17.21]There's no special toilet.
[39:21.96]I don't like shit like this, because you know the bigger the thing is, the more of a hum it has in your house.
[39:26.84]Very important knowledge for you guys to know.
[39:29.32]The larger the appliance is, the more it's going to go... And you're going to notice it one day, and you're going to be so pissed off.
[39:48.29]Click the relevant link.
[39:49.07]That was the wrong link.
[39:49.83]What?
[39:52.67]Who's your seat?
[39:54.71]Reorder now.
[39:55.95]What?
[39:58.31]Is this, can you do, is this actually?
[40:03.60]This is cool, actually.
[40:08.36]I don't hate this at all.
[40:09.16]I think this is actually really cool.
[40:13.92]Reorder.
[40:14.76]Now that's a collector's edition I could get behind.
[40:19.84]If the collector's edition just gave you a new toilet that you could install... I'd actually be into that.
[40:28.92]That'd be kind of cool.
[40:36.55]Free toilet.
[40:37.55]Well, no.
[40:38.03]A toilet's... How much is a toilet?
[40:40.43]That would make sense for a collector's edition.
[40:41.75]A toilet's like $200 or $300.
[40:42.53]How much are collector's editions of games?
[40:44.88]Like $500 or $600 sometimes? $600?
[40:52.33]300?
[40:52.35]200?
[40:52.37]Yeah, just give me a copy of Cyberpunk.
[40:57.53]And the toilet.
[40:59.23]That's good for me.
[41:00.09]Yeah, but there has to be a big, big asterisk there that says you need to install it yourself.
[41:14.35]You need to hire a plumber to install it.
[41:17.19]Imagine being the plumber that installs the Cyberpunk toilet.
[41:22.13]Yeah, I'm gonna need some work done.
[41:23.15]I'm gonna need a plumber to come over here.
[41:24.37]It's like, okay, what do you need?
[41:25.33]I need you to install a toilet for me.
[41:26.79]Okay, that sounds easy.
[41:27.81]I feel like this would be weird as a plumber.
[41:31.66]Be like, what the fuck is this?
[41:33.06]A cyberpunk, like, collector's edition toilet.
[41:35.40]What else they got here?
[41:41.32]Keanu Reeves shows up to do it.
[41:46.83]Keanu Reeves doesn't even know how to do that, though, does he?
[41:54.57]Uh, that collector's edition would be like 20 grand.
[41:59.23]Hey, I'm here to install your toilet for you.
[42:02.45]Make sure you download Cyberpunk the second it comes out next week, man.
[42:09.58]I have no idea how to install toilets, but I'm gonna try.
[42:12.52]I'm gonna look at it and do it in a little bit, man.
[42:14.54]And he comes with like a hard hat on and a bunch of like wrenches.
[42:21.48]He walks in and he just introduces, like, the install.
[42:24.60]And then the actual plumber comes in and installs the toilet for you.
[42:30.59]That might be worth it.
[42:31.59]Alright, I need a bed.
[42:40.35]Furniture.
[42:40.69]Here we go.
[42:41.07]Ooh, I like some of this stuff.
[42:42.32]Some of this stuff is cool.
[42:47.46]I would get this.
[42:47.88]This would be an awesome bed.
[42:50.54]Well, no, not really, actually.
[42:52.18]Does this fold down?
[42:53.02]Okay, if the top part folded down, it'd be like a futon.
[43:00.65]Armchairs on a bed.
[43:05.57]No, it's not a germo bed.
[43:06.97]It's a bed that would be... If it was bigger.
[43:09.15]I thought it was bigger.
[43:09.79]I didn't know it was that small.
[43:15.43]Sleep in here.
[43:16.35]Put, like, a little pillow and a blanket in there and, like, crawl in the cubby and, like, lie down lengthwise.
[43:22.71]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[43:30.08]It's gotta be one of these.
[43:31.30]Just how about line up ten gamer chairs and take the arms off?
[43:39.22]Ooh, I like this.
[43:40.18]I actually really like this.
[43:50.89]Okay, mattress.
[43:52.23]Let's make the mattress a blue.
[43:55.33]It's an Alienware bed.
[43:56.57]Yeah, the big alien head symbol is right there on the sheets.
[44:08.09]I like that.
[44:09.77]No, not that.
[44:10.93]I like that.
[44:12.87]I would sleep in this.
[44:16.72]But unfortunately, it's too big.
[44:18.06]Or is it?
[44:20.12]Or is it?
[44:20.46]Hold on.
[44:25.62]I don't like that.
[44:26.06]Get rid of that.
[44:27.22]Get rid of this too.
[44:29.96]What is here?
[44:31.06]It's outlets.
[44:31.54]Okay.
[44:32.30]It's too big.
[44:32.82]It's not too big.
[44:33.52]Just wait.
[44:35.96]Get rid of all of this.
[44:36.70]I don't want any of this shit.
[44:39.14]I'm redoing this whole thing.
[44:40.22]Okay.
[44:54.88]You have to go up this way to get in and out of bed.
[44:58.02]But people get to see you sleep!
[45:07.45]No, get a big curtain!
[45:14.78]New offer, add Dermasus as an emote to double your debt.
[45:17.98]I've been seeing this picture a lot recently, and I don't get it.
[45:20.62]I don't understand.
[45:21.42]And you know what?
[45:22.04]I'm actually happy this picture is making the rounds, and you guys are memeing the absolute hell out of this picture.
[45:27.59]Can anybody tell me why?
[45:32.47]Because this looks better than the original.
[45:36.51]So by all means, please, please spread this around.
[45:39.54]Please make every meme possible.
[45:41.84]Make this the top searched thing.
[45:43.36]Because that looks better than the actual original picture.
[45:52.21]It looks worse.
[45:52.65]No, it doesn't.
[45:57.73]What have you done?
[46:00.59]New emote.
[46:01.59]No.
[46:02.17]A new emote.
[46:03.25]That would be so terrifying.
[46:06.40]Maybe like a B-T-TV emote.
[46:10.20]Here's the problem.
[46:10.96]Any emote that's added that's a real sub-emote, you can use anywhere on this website.
[46:16.89]So, I know you guys will spam that in channels, and you'll give us a bad reputation.
[46:25.24]Like, oh, here's like this GermoSus emote fucking smile like scary community again.
[46:29.72]Wow, can't wait to like pretend to like these guys until they leave.
[46:36.78]You think people do that?
[46:42.93]I don't think so.
[46:43.47]I think we've got a good community here.
[46:44.87]But, like, if you spam the Jerm of fucking scary SCP emote enough times, maybe they won't think that way.
[46:52.14]I want a painting right here.
[46:52.96]A big one.
[46:59.18]Painting.
[47:02.86]What's something futuristic looking?
[47:15.53]It's like every single... Hold on.
[47:21.41]I want to put another picture here that's a face.
[47:26.61]Or like a body, like a head lying this way.
[47:36.38]TOS?
[47:36.72]What do you mean TOS?
[47:43.42]This is clearly a dog bone.
[47:47.83]It's a dog bone and it's somebody just holding on to it.
[47:51.07]What are you talking about?
[47:56.03]I like that so far.
[47:56.83]I need something here.
[47:57.37]How about something nuclear?
[48:02.41]I said it wrong.
[48:02.91]Whatever.
[48:03.81]Scream in my face.
[48:08.43]What about HGTV?
[48:11.30]Oh, nuclear.
[48:16.84]Yeah, the walls have to change too.
[48:17.94]Alright, installations.
[48:24.90]Alright, hold on.
[48:27.26]Are you sure you want to come over to this guy's house?
[48:36.23]Would you sit in this seat?
[48:39.17]You tell me.
[48:51.10]You gonna sit in that chair?
[48:56.33]Why would you have that, though?
[48:58.79]I have my electric chair.
[49:00.11]That's a hot seat.
[49:08.92]What the fuck is this link?
[49:10.14]Alright, what is it?
[49:10.98]Okay.
[49:11.66]We're getting some weird links today.
[49:15.45]What the fuck?
[49:18.09]What?
[49:20.27]Oh, ah, this makes me uncomfortable to look at.
[49:22.33]I don't even want to put this on stream.
[49:23.63]This is like, this is weird.
[49:25.08]It's like morphing.
[49:26.08]I don't want to put this on stream.
[49:29.48]This is terrifying.
[49:36.20]Why is it, what is it, what's morphing?
[49:39.63]Ah!
[49:39.75]Oh.
[49:44.43]Ah!
[49:45.93]Ah!
[49:55.63]Jesus Christ.
[49:56.23]Yeah, I know.
[49:57.01]Why do you guys make this stuff?
[50:01.07]I'm supposed to be the weird guy.
[50:02.69]I'm the weird guy, right?
[50:05.29]Alright.
[50:08.65]Well, yes, I did make a pretend electric execution chair in my apartment.
[50:13.12]Yes.
[50:14.70]But I didn't finish.
[50:15.92]I was going to put a nice picture of a bird up here.
[50:33.15]Okay, see?
[50:38.36]That is what would happen.
[50:41.38]It would use all the power in the building.
[50:44.04]The building would turn off.
[50:49.65]Why would I have, like, a death chair?
[50:58.13]Alright.
[50:58.93]What happened to all the lights?
[51:05.54]Is there a vending machine outside?
[51:07.14]It's for your enemies.
[51:10.16]It's for me to convince people to come over and sit in a chair?
[51:19.22]Why would you... Why would you want... Okay, if you had an enemy, how would you convince them to come over your house?
[51:25.26]I know we like fucking hate each other.
[51:26.44]We're dastardly villains to each other.
[51:29.26]But come over to my apartment.
[51:31.16]And come up here.
[51:32.42]Come up the stairs and come sit in this chair.
[51:36.77]And don't move.
[51:38.43]Like, a little bit.
[51:39.49]And just hang out on your phone.
[51:40.53]Okay, I need more furniture.
[51:51.34]This sucks.
[51:53.02]I want... You know what?
[51:53.92]You know what I've always wanted?
[51:55.04]And you guys can think I'm crazy for this, but am I?
[51:58.82]I've always wanted...
[52:04.96]and be lying in bed, and have a sort of a lower ceiling, and have a big TV up here.
[52:13.05]Is that weird?
[52:13.69]Fuck, I can't do it.
[52:30.66]Dammit, I can't do it?
[52:31.84]Why?
[52:34.79]Let me live my fantasies.
[52:40.29]TV.
[52:40.69]Can I mount this TV?
[52:44.59]No, I can't.
[52:45.15]Damn it.
[52:49.36]I really have always wanted that.
[52:50.30]I feel like that would be so convenient.
[52:53.02]But what if it fell and crushed you?
[53:01.16]You're lying here, just like this, watching, like, a nature documentary.
[53:05.48]Those monkeys are funny.
[53:11.59]And the thing just... That would be so horrible.
[53:20.29]Yeah, that's kind of scary.
[53:21.21]It would need to be bolted to a stud.
[53:22.77]There are no studs in the ceiling.
[53:23.91]I don't know.
[53:27.20]How would you get it up there?
[53:30.76]What have you... You're doing something else.
[53:36.81]You're lying in bed, looking up.
[53:44.17]There's your use.
[53:45.36]It comes crashing down on you.
[54:08.28]The police find you?
[54:11.01]What the hell happened here?
[54:13.59]Why is he lying on his back?
[54:15.73]And he's... I don't know.
[54:18.21]How did this happen?
[54:24.19]I cannot see.
[54:24.91]We need to get three of the top FBI detectives to come out here because I have no fucking idea how this dude died here.
[54:39.30]Okay.
[54:40.08]I can't put the TV on the ceiling, so whatever.
[54:41.50]I'm gonna put, uh... Get rid of this.
[54:46.20]I don't want this.
[54:46.56]I don't want this.
[54:46.98]I don't want this.
[54:48.20]I don't want that.
[54:48.58]Alright, what else do we have?
[54:58.53]Doors and windows.
[55:01.05]Just put these everywhere.
[55:07.05]Just be that person that has the uncomfortable amount of, like, kind of, like, lewd artwork all over their house.
[55:14.01]Everywhere.
[55:22.66]In the dinner table.
[55:23.44]It's in the dining room.
[55:24.62]It's the dinner table.
[55:25.50]The dinner table is that.
[55:27.66]Kind of just painted onto the wood.
[55:31.50]Now, I need a cool couch.
[55:32.62]And this TV sucks.
[55:35.65]I'm sorry.
[55:36.09]Wait, that had an arm on it.
[55:45.81]Microwave cyberwave?
[55:52.84]Crane monitor.
[55:54.86]Oh boy.
[56:05.04]Shit.
[56:07.67]Okay, well, I could do this and tilt it down.
[56:10.55]Right?
[56:13.61]Like, technically, I could lie down like this and, like, tilt it down.
[56:25.69]Upside down.
[56:27.17]No, you would install it upside down, so then you would arrange it away so when it faced down, it was the right way.
[56:34.26]You know what I mean?
[56:34.82]So you'd have to arrange it a way where you would lie like this, and it goes face down, and it would be the right side up.
[56:43.07]So hold on.
[56:44.71]This has to change.
[56:51.27]Okay, so then now... Yeah, there, see?
[56:55.48]Now the arm bends down like this.
[57:08.58]It's a guillotine television.
[57:12.66]You better pray this arm is strong as hell.
[57:20.69]Yeah.
[57:21.39]Extend it down.
[57:22.83]That works.
[57:29.08]Ban Discord users.
[57:30.20]Ban Discord users.
[57:31.32]Why would I do that?
[57:34.56]They already gave me the cool mouse and keyboard and desk.
[57:36.26]They already furnished it.
[57:39.01]I want... Get this out of here.
[57:40.19]I don't like this down here in the living space.
[57:42.05]I want this up here.
[57:47.95]This is a cooler up here, I think.
[57:50.89]Yeah, like right there.
[57:52.62]That's cooler.
[57:56.70]Let's move a couple of these.
[57:57.70]I don't need this one.
[58:04.18]Get rid of it.
[58:06.99]This is wrong.
[58:08.38]Who needs more than six shelves?
[58:10.10]Let's be real.
[58:16.47]Make it flush.
[58:19.51]Nice.
[58:19.89]Alright, cool.
[58:24.93]Reddit shelves.
[58:26.61]Hey, Reddit shelves is cool.
[58:31.86]Down with Discord Dave.
[58:33.24]I don't know who that is.
[58:37.19]I like this.
[58:37.79]Um, this computer is cool, but could be better.
[58:44.99]Oh, shit.
[58:45.41]Let me see.
[58:45.85]I got subs coming in.
[58:48.95]We had five subs from Lime, and then 25 from Freddy Dread.
[58:52.45]What's going on, Freddy?
[58:54.21]Thanks for the huge amount of subs.
[58:56.61]I want to make this clear again.
[58:57.91]I want to make this clear.
[58:58.65]We have maybe some people that- I have to change- I didn't change the fucking rules.
[59:01.61]I'm so stupid.
[59:03.07]I no longer read bits anymore.
[59:07.40]In fact, I probably am going to make the bit minimum to give to the channel like something that's impossible.
[59:17.83]Should I do that?
[59:25.58]One tagged five million.
[59:28.46]No, people will do it.
[59:29.88]That scares me, though.
[59:30.72]You're right.
[59:32.32]If I make the bit minimum like $5,000, somebody's going to do it, aren't they?
[59:42.54]What happened with the bits?
[59:45.90]Well, to give a long story, a shorter TL;DR here.
[59:50.42]I kind of want to get rid of the bits to be read on stream kind of thing because I got rid of the bit reading at the end of the streams.
[59:57.30]If you don't know, if you're new to the channel, I used to read all bit donations over $2.50 on stream at the end of a stream.
[60:06.94]And what I ended up doing is because I had a lot of medical problems and I used to sit here for about four or five hours and then I did be about an hour or two of a wind down where we did the end of the stream.
[60:15.64]So I decided that because it was better if I could just sit here and stream and then be able just to get up whenever so I didn't have to potentially put extra couple hours to the stream.
[60:23.68]I could stream for a little bit longer until I was like, okay, I got to get up.
[60:28.44]But what happened was I still was doing like people were giving $50 and $100 bit drops, which is huge and insane.
[60:34.57]And I can't even imagine giving that amount of money to anybody.
[60:38.85]But I was still reading those because they were so large that I almost felt like that's so much money.
[60:44.35]I kind of have to respond to that, right?
[60:47.62]So now I'm no longer going to be doing that.
[60:53.89]Because I didn't want to put a precedence in place where pay $100 for the streamer to actually read it.
[61:00.93]Because I feel like that's unfair and I don't want people to think they have to do that.
[61:08.11]So, like I said before, if you want to support this channel, which people do, and every day I wake up in the morning and I go, this is a stupid amount of support and money.
[61:20.15]I can't even believe it.
[61:21.06]It's uncountable in my brain.
[61:23.85]Just sub.
[61:25.30]And you don't have to give hundreds of dollars on a stream.
[61:29.28]I would much rather you take care of yourself or support some other potentially smaller streamers that are out there.
[61:36.30]That would make me feel better about that.
[61:39.26]I think that would be better.
[61:47.32]So, bit readings are gone permanently.
[61:50.72]And they are never coming back.
[61:51.86]But I still call out subgifs.
[61:55.20]Because the theory behind that was it was something that people were getting.
[61:57.78]And it wasn't just... I mean, obviously, it's me getting money from those subs.
[62:03.17]But people are getting them.
[62:04.49]And they can use the subs.
[62:05.61]And I think it's a little different.
[62:11.05]Greed.
[62:11.37]Greed.
[62:14.45]No one gives the slightest of fucks resident sleeper.
[62:17.22]Well, I mean, if you gave $50 today and I didn't read it, you're probably going like, what the fuck is going on here?
[62:27.25]What do you mean true?
[62:28.61]I'm getting trued right now?
[62:31.13]I got to be clear.
[62:31.97]I got to be clear.
[62:32.57]I want to make sure I'm clear on this.
[62:33.95]And look, just relax.
[62:36.87]Hold on.
[62:38.13]True, true, true.
[62:39.36]Don't true me.
[62:45.49]I need a couch.
[62:45.97]Ooh!
[62:56.38]I like this.
[62:57.44]But I want it to be blue.
[62:59.76]Like, super blue.
[63:03.36]And yeah, and now, yes, I said the word sub, and here comes a shitload of subs.
[63:10.10]Okay, I'm never gonna say money on the- Of course I am.
[63:16.02]Why blue?
[63:16.60]Because teal is my favorite color.
[63:18.98]You guys know that.
[63:20.06]Teal, aqua, light kind of greenish.
[63:22.18]Green, aqua, blue.
[63:24.13]It's beautiful.
[63:24.59]I love it.
[63:28.29]Alright, let's make this interesting.
[63:41.09]In here?
[63:43.56]Okay, if I put it, where do I put the TV?
[63:45.26]I don't even need a TV.
[63:46.30]I got a TV up there.
[63:49.86]This is a fridge.
[63:52.72]Alright, fridge is going over here.
[63:56.76]Why not?
[63:58.89]Fridge is going over here.
[63:59.65]Because then you can just roll the chair back and just open it up and grab whatever you want.
[64:16.08]Shit.
[64:16.46]This is cool, but it's too big.
[64:18.02]It's going to be really loud next to your ears.
[64:27.01]Will it though?
[64:30.55]Okay.
[64:31.21]This is not bad.
[64:33.79]How would you even get up there to turn these on and off?
[64:45.08]Did I ever tell you guys that I didn't have heat or air conditioning in my old place in Massachusetts?
[64:56.37]In, in where, no, hold on.
[64:59.01]Let me, let me fix that.
[65:00.53]Where I, the place where I was streaming, there wasn't AC into that room.
[65:05.64]There wasn't heat into that room.
[65:07.46]So every day I'd have to like, how did I survive in there?
[65:12.30]With body heat, because I get so hot, it didn't even matter.
[65:18.28]During the winter, I would just generate, I'm my own heater.
[65:23.22]The computer in the hot room, it would just make the room like 70 degrees every time.
[65:31.47]Okay, I want a... I need like a lamp or something.
[65:38.01]Dude, I can't even break anything in this one.
[65:42.03]Yeah, I can.
[65:46.14]Well, dude, let's make it like modern.
[65:47.90]Let's make it like post-modern.
[65:50.50]Watch this.
[65:59.02]There we go.
[65:59.86]Nice.
[66:00.18]Let's have like, you know, bricks and like broken bricks and shit that people come and go.
[66:08.91]Oh, wow.
[66:09.93]Cool.
[66:10.47]Postmodern.
[66:16.81]I can't even break this wall.
[66:18.95]Open up the bathroom.
[66:19.85]No, I just want a postmodern bathroom entrance.
[66:22.09]That's it.
[66:29.25]I break this.
[66:38.82]What can I even do in this room?
[66:40.14]This room is so boring.
[66:47.13]What do you put in here?
[66:49.87]What am I doing?
[66:50.43]Am I stupid?
[66:56.37]This is the TV room.
[66:57.39]This is the entertainment room.
[67:05.73]This is too big, though.
[67:07.47]Wait, is it?
[67:07.97]No, it's not.
[67:09.81]It's perfect.
[67:12.05]Nice, okay.
[67:12.95]And then, like, the TV can be right here.
[67:15.09]That's awful.
[67:27.40]Alright, well, it's too big.
[67:28.66]So, I'm gonna put this back.
[67:33.10]You have a flat.
[67:35.28]So...
[67:37.53]I'm utilizing the space.
[67:39.33]That can stay there.
[67:41.79]What goes in the middle?
[67:42.49]Like a dining table.
[67:43.39]Is there a cyberpunk dining table?
[67:44.91]Holy shit, there's pinball?
[68:04.78]No!
[68:09.01]No, there's nowhere to put this.
[68:14.89]I guess I could put it over here.
[68:17.92]That's kind of cool.
[68:21.66]Oh, the fridge is too... Please listen to LEGO Rock Raiders 2 soundtrack while you play.
[68:30.20]It's quiet.
[68:31.92]No, it's going to DMCA the stream.
[68:35.45]I hate this thing.
[68:37.35]Seriously, I don't... All the gaming chairs, I think they're so ugly.
[68:40.35]I'm sorry.
[68:40.81]I really believe that.
[68:42.51]They're just huge and bulky and... I just don't... I don't like them.
[68:46.57]I really don't.
[68:48.70]Some of them are okay.
[68:49.46]There's actually a couple that look alright.
[68:51.90]But... I just... No, they're huge.
[68:54.36]Huge, huge, huge, huge, huge.
[68:55.62]Remember, when are you going to post your Firewatch photos?
[68:59.62]I already did.
[69:06.54]Hmm.
[69:10.46]Oh, I don't like it.
[69:12.42]I don't, I just, I'm not into it.
[69:15.26]I like more stuff like this.
[69:17.60]You know, some of that like postmodern kind of style.
[69:19.96]But it needs to be more comfortable.
[69:24.56]Hmm.
[69:28.93]I thought, okay, I thought this was a cauldron, like a witch's cauldron.
[69:31.23]Is this a seat?
[69:33.29]Is this a seat?
[69:36.16]Why is this seat squished?
[69:39.18]A garden swing.
[69:40.56]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[69:41.54]Alright, come on.
[69:51.18]Shit.
[69:51.48]I have to assemble this?
[70:00.63]That's a pain in the ass.
[70:09.02]Real stream setup.
[70:13.70]Cool, alright, and it can swing too.
[70:15.82]Can I use it?
[70:16.86]I wanna sit on it.
[70:19.50]Oh, but that's too impractical.
[70:21.82]Wait, I can't even move this.
[70:25.37]I can't move it.
[70:34.27]Shit.
[70:39.40]Put it up here.
[70:45.90]Okay.
[70:48.28]I don't know what happened.
[70:50.84]I talked about this a month or so ago or a few weeks ago.
[70:54.44]This stream has become just... I never used to talk like this before.
[70:59.63]Never, never, never, ever.
[71:02.32]Think back like a year or two ago.
[71:04.10]Never would you hear these words coming out of my mouth.
[71:05.80]I would never say the word sex swing on my stream a year ago.
[71:12.33]I'd be like, holy shit, I'm not saying that out loud.
[71:14.29]What the fuck?
[71:16.63]I think you guys may have infiltrated my brain.
[71:24.68]But I'm putting it up here.
[71:31.36]Wait, I don't know about this, though.
[71:32.84]Sir, like, you've got, like, the electric chair, like, the Zex swing.
[71:36.77]The... How do you explain all this?
[71:50.52]Oh, it's for decoration.
[71:51.24]It's for decoration.
[71:53.35]Oh, you have this, like, electric- a chair that you sit in and you turn it on and it electrocutes you.
[71:56.67]Yes, it's for decoration.
[71:58.71]What's the swing up here for?
[71:59.97]Like, this, like, sex swing.
[72:01.27]It's for decoration.
[72:05.69]What are these- you have- you have, like, a modded arcade cabinet.
[72:09.68]With, like, 10,000 porn games on it.
[72:12.76]Yes, it's for decoration.
[72:14.48]Oh, okay.
[72:16.24]The TV that bends down while you lie on your back in bed, is that for decoration?
[72:20.95]Uh, yes.
[72:22.33]But it functions.
[72:23.77]And you watch TV on it.
[72:25.39]Yes.
[72:26.87]So it's not a decoration.
[72:28.11]It has a practical use.
[72:30.46]No.
[72:31.14]Yes.
[72:33.80]Well, um... It's been fun.
[72:38.00]Maybe I'll call you later.
[72:39.36]700,000 Zorn games.
[72:47.98]This is the kind of place that, like, if you, like, if mom comes over, she can't touch anything.
[72:53.22]This is why you can't have any of that shit, man.
[72:55.22]Oh, I have, like, porn here, porn stuff, porn thing, porn sex this, sex that.
[73:00.73]It's like, oh, mom's coming over.
[73:01.91]Well, mom, you can't touch anything.
[73:03.53]You have to literally sit in the waiting room.
[73:06.49]And here's, I'll put a bed here.
[73:07.87]Like, there's, you can't have all this stuff.
[73:14.65]What is this, a porn fridge?
[73:17.86]Not everything has to be porn fridge, porn swing, porn cabinet, porn bed.
[73:26.15]I like this spot, so I'm putting a shelf here.
[73:29.21]Porn stairs.
[73:32.24]What do you mean porn stairs?
[73:59.49]Mom, you can never come over my house.
[74:05.36]And this is an apartment too.
[74:06.52]This is a smaller, this is kind of a small apartment.
[74:10.00]You have like the living area and everyone can see everything.
[74:13.36]No one can ever come over your house.
[74:14.57]You can't have like a porn swing.
[74:25.26]Small in the sense that like everything is visible from everywhere in the entire, besides the bathroom.
[74:31.78]You can't have a porn swing just in your bed area up here in a loft in an apartment like this.
[74:39.88]He's a millionaire streamer.
[74:42.59]Okay, so hold on.
[74:44.13]I'm the millionaire streamer, but you guys are talking about wanting to install a porn sex swing up in your loft.
[74:52.07]How much do you think a professionally installed porn swing costs?
[74:57.71]It can't be less.
[74:58.51]It's probably more than $1,000.
[75:00.93]Way more, probably.
[75:01.67]Yeah, it's probably like $3,000 to $5,000.
[75:05.86]Why do I know?
[75:06.50]I don't know.
[75:07.12]I'm asking chat.
[75:08.26]You guys are the Zorn masters.
[75:09.28]It's $6,000 for that.
[75:09.62]Okay.
[75:15.73]But I'm the millionaire streamer.
[75:17.51]You guys are the 6k porn zorn swing streamers.
[75:22.27]I said streamer.
[75:23.36]You get the idea.
[75:29.32]A porn swing streamer.
[75:34.92]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[75:36.66]I gotta move on.
[75:37.32]I gotta move on.
[75:37.92]No, I'm not gonna do the porn swing.
[75:39.82]I'm not doing it.
[75:40.62]It's too much.
[75:41.18]My mother's probably watching.
[75:51.03]Okay.
[75:52.09]What do we got for a table?
[75:52.99]Something cool.
[75:53.65]Something modern.
[75:55.85]Something contemporary.
[75:56.91]How about... Oh, just a boring wood table.
[76:03.46]I love wood.
[76:06.70]Wood is so easy.
[76:12.78]You need to put a fuck table in.
[76:17.87]Don't even eat food.
[76:23.60]Why is this one dirty?
[76:25.26]Oh, it's not.
[76:25.92]There's like a design on it.
[76:39.90]I'm corrupted.
[76:40.70]I've been corrupted.
[76:42.48]Total corruption.
[76:43.84]Total corruption!
[76:45.94]Total power!
[76:51.56]No, I don't need a changing table.
[76:58.23]I don't even know what to put in here.
[76:59.25]This place is done.
[77:06.48]I don't even know what else to do here.
[77:07.80]Alright, I'm just gonna pick this one here.
[77:14.86]Whatever.
[77:20.44]Whatever.
[77:20.88]Who cares?
[77:21.26]That's so big.
[77:22.66]It really is.
[77:23.12]Do the arcade house.
[77:26.33]Yeah, but if I do the arcade house, it's over.
[77:28.67]And it's just going to be arcade cabinets everywhere.
[77:30.73]And then my, like, porn room loft 2.0.
[77:34.07]I already did the porn room last time.
[77:40.59]Kitchen?
[77:40.93]I don't have a kitchen.
[77:49.55]Chat has collectively lost their mind.
[77:54.96]Okay, you know how they say that the streamer influences the chat?
[77:58.46]And your chat is sort of an extension of you and your personality in a way?
[78:03.85]It's the opposite here.
[78:05.33]Absolutely.
[78:11.41]I have been consumed by Twitch chat.
[78:17.89]Where's the bathroom right here?
[78:20.29]I'll add a little kitchenette.
[78:22.67]Here's the bathroom right here.
[78:23.91]Okay.
[78:31.49]This sucks.
[78:32.51]I'll get rid of that.
[78:34.74]This is fine.
[78:35.36]I can just, like, I don't know.
[78:36.56]I can run around in a circle here really easily.
[78:38.62]That's good.
[78:44.20]Nancy's looking in there right now.
[78:46.81]Greg.
[78:47.89]Come here, come here, come here.
[78:48.57]Greg, Greg, Greg.
[78:48.89]Come here, come here, come here.
[78:50.95]The dude in that loft that we can see is, like, fucking running in circles right now.
[78:54.47]What?
[78:54.69]No, he's not.
[78:55.59]Look, look, dude.
[78:56.15]Look, look, look.
[78:58.41]Holy shit.
[78:59.31]What the fuck is he doing?
[79:00.74]I don't know.
[79:01.52]He does weird shit in there all the time.
[79:02.66]He was putting up like a swing too earlier.
[79:04.30]Should we call somebody?
[79:06.98]Who are we going to call?
[79:08.72]What's our jurisdiction?
[79:10.24]I don't know.
[79:12.51]I just feel like maybe we should.
[79:13.39]No, no, no, no.
[79:15.45]We're like two miles away, Nancy.
[79:17.99]Just stop looking in that window.
[79:20.57]He's going up the stairs.
[79:23.68]Stop looking.
[79:24.44]I don't want to even know about it.
[79:25.44]Don't tell me about it.
[79:27.28]He just turned his TV on.
[79:28.16]He's lying down, I think.
[79:30.20]Why does he not have curtains?
[79:30.98]This is so fucked up.
[79:33.10]He doesn't have curtains?
[79:33.84]No, he doesn't.
[79:34.64]He's weird.
[79:36.80]He's putting the TV down.
[79:40.02]Okay.
[79:40.54]Alright.
[79:40.98]Okay.
[79:41.76]I'm not looking anymore.
[79:43.54]What?
[79:43.70]What?
[79:43.98]What?
[79:44.12]Let me see.
[79:44.48]Let me see.
[79:45.14]No, no.
[79:45.46]Don't look.
[79:45.78]Don't look.
[79:46.08]It's fucked.
[79:46.54]No, wait.
[79:46.88]No, no.
[79:47.14]Don't look.
[79:47.70]Let me see what he's doing over there.
[79:49.46]Oh, Jesus.
[79:50.97]What is he...
[79:52.81]I told you to stop looking through this guy's window.
[79:55.55]I can't.
[79:55.97]What do you want me to do?
[79:57.37]I'm sorry.
[79:57.93]You do this shit.
[80:00.25]I'm not doing this.
[80:02.10]We're moving.
[80:03.84]Look, we don't have to move.
[80:05.32]We don't have to move.
[80:06.54]Yes, we do.
[80:07.28]The temptation to look at this guy doing crazy shit is off the charts.
[80:11.45]We're moving two floors down so we don't have to see him anymore.
[80:23.57]He's always inflating his cheeks on the window.
[80:25.72]He knows we're watching.
[80:27.40]He's doing the thing that the kids do.
[80:29.52]What should I put?
[80:43.43]I don't know what else to do.
[80:44.49]What else do I do here?
[80:49.94]Oh, lamps!
[80:50.50]We need- Oh, how about relax, chill?
[80:55.38]Can I spell another word out?
[80:57.74]Chill.
[81:00.24]Hold on.
[81:00.64]How big can I make this?
[81:05.94]He's- Actually, he's not even putting up curtains.
[81:09.59]He's installing a shitload of- Hold on.
[81:15.19]Where's my build tool?
[81:24.66]I don't know what he's doing.
[81:25.28]He's building... He's building a wall.
[81:36.74]This would be... Have they made a movie like this before?
[81:39.94]I think they have, right?
[81:41.44]Haven't they?
[81:43.10]Well, like the guy across the apartment is doing crazy shit.
[81:47.45]And it's like they keep looking through the window and seeing him.
[81:52.18]What is he doing?
[81:53.68]Oh my god.
[81:56.28]Nancy, oh my god.
[81:56.78]I don't know what he's doing.
[81:57.46]I think he knows we're watching.
[82:06.36]Nancy!
[82:06.90]Nancy!
[82:07.52]Nancy!
[82:07.94]I think he's looking over here.
[82:10.40]He installed a thing on a wall and says relax.
[82:13.86]Why do we need to relax?
[82:14.90]Is he talking about us?
[82:17.10]He must be looking.
[82:17.61]Why did he do that?
[82:18.69]Why would he build that?
[82:23.60]Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy.
[82:25.54]We got to move.
[82:39.72]Oh, that was a weird sleep.
[82:43.23]I didn't get much sleep.
[82:43.87]That was terrifying.
[82:47.07]Nancy, wake up.
[82:51.51]What's going on out the window?
[82:54.48]What are you talking about?
[82:55.14]What do you mean?
[82:57.16]He's standing there still.
[82:59.06]He's still standing there looking out the window.
[83:01.29]No, no way.
[83:02.13]No, it's impossible.
[83:03.29]He was doing that last night.
[83:04.23]He hasn't moved.
[83:04.89]What do you mean he hasn't moved?
[83:09.35]Nancy, he hasn't moved in a full like seven or eight hours.
[83:13.90]He's just looking right over at our window.
[83:18.70]Jesus.
[83:20.68]Wait, he's moving.
[83:23.65]Nancy, what's he doing?
[83:24.73]Nancy, I think he's leaving his apartment.
[83:27.50]Nancy, Nancy, Nancy!
[83:28.52]I don't know what to do.
[83:42.83]How annoying is this, really, though?
[83:46.15]This is a mix of rear window and cape fear.
[83:48.97]Hahaha.
[83:52.94]Bar.
[83:54.39]Chill.
[83:55.53]Relax.
[84:03.68]Okay, that was fun.
[84:06.04]I had fun in the DLC.
[84:11.49]How do I get over there, though?
[84:24.53]Can I hold on?
[84:25.11]Is there like a... You gonna play more Teardown?
[84:48.51]Uh, probably not.
[84:49.21]No, I'm leaving.
[84:49.93]I'm leaving this.
[84:50.57]I'm leaving.
[84:56.56]No, I'm moving to a different house.
[84:57.80]I want to do a different house.
[84:58.66]That was fun little DLC, but I'm moving to a different house.
[85:09.44]No, what?
[85:16.31]None of this shit.
[85:16.99]Look at how nice this looks.
[85:18.47]None of this is mine.
[85:19.71]This is a downloaded save file.
[85:22.67]Actually, you know what?
[85:24.88]Let's... Owned.
[85:26.28]How many... Aww.
[85:32.86]I thought we'd be able to see his, uh... His progress.
[85:38.33]Just married house.
[85:39.97]I don't remember this one.
[85:44.21]Yeah, we did the moon already.
[85:45.07]I don't think I have enough money for this.
[85:49.46]I remember I did the moon base.
[85:53.68]I did the man cave.
[85:54.56]Which one have I not done?
[86:00.19]Variable woman's house.
[86:03.23]What?
[86:03.39]What does that mean?
[86:08.07]What is a variable woman's house?
[86:24.21]It's code?
[86:24.89]What do you mean it's code?
[86:37.20]What the hell is this house?
[86:39.16]Wait, what?
[86:44.96]This house is very strange.
[86:48.28]Can I do this one?
[86:55.95]I think I already did this one.
[86:58.90]Why is there a sliding door here?
[87:00.10]Wait, this house is already done.
[87:06.74]It's just dirty.
[87:14.17]I did do... No, no, no.
[87:15.37]This is a save file.
[87:20.43]This looks like a dark RP... Yeah, we made the FPS house already.
[87:23.67]What about outside?
[87:24.23]Hold on.
[87:29.19]Just flip it harder.
[87:30.15]Okay, well.
[87:36.42]It's wall mom time.
[87:39.00]Okay.
[87:39.40]I'm not going to look at the mini-map.
[87:42.28]I have no idea where I am.
[87:44.71]I don't know where I am.
[87:46.41]This is a bathroom here, and then there's... This is a... Okay, this is... Bathroom.
[87:52.61]I don't know where I am in the house.
[87:56.88]Hold on.
[87:57.80]Okay, so you have the entrance, then you have a hallway leading to a hallway leading to a bathroom and an outdoor... This wall has to come down.
[88:09.70]Just gut it.
[88:22.50]Let's just make a game show house where you have to pick a certain door and there's like traps behind one of them.
[88:32.73]Just make a giant game show stage.
[88:41.95]We're gonna have like a sign too, like a sound stage.
[88:49.96]Make a saw house.
[88:55.58]I mean, what do you mean?
[88:56.62]So wait, every room has a new, a different trap in it?
[89:06.41]Let me clean up the bugs first.
[89:20.32]You know what the worst part about this?
[89:22.52]Oh, you all know.
[89:23.44]You all know what I'm about to do.
[89:24.88]And I know it's going to make people really, really uncomfortable.
[89:26.79]Here we go.
[89:27.61]You know that it's not going to be that simple.
[89:29.09]It's going to be this.
[89:46.28]Stop, stop, stop.
[89:47.26]No.
[89:48.80]Alright, I will.
[89:50.38]That was awful.
[89:53.72]Can't have this cool thing in the saw house.
[90:00.64]I don't even know who the fuck I am.
[90:02.07]Alright, I have to destroy everything.
[90:08.89]I was making a sandwich.
[90:09.55]What did I miss?
[90:10.17]Bug noises and like bug suck up kill with vacuum noises.
[90:14.06]So I'm glad you weren't here.
[90:16.20]Unless you're eating a bug sandwich.
[90:17.60]Then you probably wouldn't care.
[90:28.09]Bugsnax, that's right.
[90:42.51]It's Bugsnax.
[90:45.82]Kind of bug and kind of snack.
[90:47.56]Kind of bug and kind of snack.
[90:49.30]Kind of bug and kind of snack.
[90:52.40]It's Bugsnax.
[90:59.03]Oh, somebody check.
[90:59.65]Did the VOD, did the friends theme song get claimed?
[91:12.99]Ugh.
[91:15.05]Yes.
[91:16.55]No, it didn't.
[91:27.47]Keep roaches for the saw trap room.
[91:30.71]Oh shit.
[91:32.77]Oh my god, what am I cleaning for?
[91:34.94]Yeah, I gotta move trash and stuff.
[91:37.28]Oh shit, what am I doing?
[91:41.16]I gotta keep trash and put it in different rooms.
[91:44.46]Oh shit.
[91:48.45]Any more bug clusters?
[91:52.85]Yep, okay.
[91:53.79]This would be like the you get eaten alive by bugs room.
[92:04.60]The best part about this is the fact that you can't remove windows in this game.
[92:08.14]So... Oh, make your choice here in room with bugs.
[92:11.14]They're gonna eat your eyes until you get the key.
[92:13.10]This is like in a suburban neighborhood.
[92:22.19]Board it up.
[92:23.75]I need to clean this though.
[92:24.41]I love that sound.
[92:29.31]Saw's in here right now getting ready.
[92:32.85]Hey, you know, clean up the windows.
[92:36.59]Looks good.
[92:45.13]Very, very good.
[92:46.39]Excellent.
[92:56.20]This is what he does.
[93:00.03]Alright, there's a room right here.
[93:02.17]So it's going to be, we'll need a wall.
[93:03.87]But first of all, let me get the actual, I've got to destroy everything.
[93:10.10]He thinks his name is Saw.
[93:11.24]No, I know his name is not Saw.
[93:12.78]I know it's Billy the Puppet.
[93:16.23]Jigsaw is the name of the killer.
[93:19.11]Billy the Puppet is the name of the puppet.
[93:36.96]God damn it, he's too smart.
[93:39.50]Yeah.
[93:41.27]I think I really am.
[93:42.05]I really do.
[93:46.79]I took the Do You Know Your Saw lore quiz, and I got a 60.
[93:50.17]I mean, you could watch those movies a hundred times in a row, and you still wouldn't know what's going on.
[93:59.40]Oh, definitely gonna make, like, this weird trap with, like, a saw.
[94:01.69]Like, a blade comes out of there and, like, hits somebody in the head.
[94:04.31]Right?
[94:04.53]Oh, this is, like, the gas.
[94:06.11]Okay, hold on.
[94:06.67]Keep that.
[94:10.21]How about just a tub?
[94:12.61]No, no.
[94:13.07]Okay, I'm gonna leave that.
[94:22.44]And there's bugs in here, too.
[94:23.56]Good.
[94:23.78]Good.
[94:30.41]Okay, how about, like, you have to fold a certain amount of t-shirts.
[94:35.89]You don't fold ten t-shirts correctly like they do at Old Navy.
[94:41.44]In two minutes, the room will fill with gas.
[94:43.76]Alright, that's, I like that.
[94:58.77]That's it sauce this this saw like sucks living with saw If you do not fold the laundry 20 minutes or less your roommate will be very mad at you Your husband will be upset your wife will be very frustrated with you and
[95:28.35]I stole this joke from chat.
[95:30.67]Make your choice.
[95:34.19]Living with Saw.
[95:47.53]Kylo Ren.
[95:49.23]No, not every low voice is Kylo Ren.
[95:52.03]Not every low, kind of mumbly voice is
[95:56.85]You know what?
[95:58.43]Why don't one of you make an edit where you just... Listen.
[96:02.54]Listen to me.
[96:03.90]Make an edit with Saw talking instead of Kylo Ren in different scenes.
[96:09.50]You could probably find plenty of clips that would make sense.
[96:12.10]And do the vice versa.
[96:13.22]Do it the other way.
[96:14.98]You could probably replace Saw talking with a bunch of scenes in Star Wars.
[96:20.92]And it would probably go seamlessly together.
[96:25.36]The other way could be true too.
[96:27.69]Oh, look at this.
[96:28.11]This is one of those, like... The best part about the Saw movies is when, like, they open the door.
[96:32.92]They open the door like this.
[96:34.44]And they see kind of whatever it is, and it goes... And it zooms in, like, all sepia and fucked up, and it, like, shows all the, like, the wires.
[96:41.76]Yeah, I like this already.
[96:50.92]And then it zooms in on their face, and they go, like...
[96:55.61]Like, they head ghosts a little while they're shaking around.
[96:58.61]Hell they don't used to do.
[97:17.84]A mirror?
[97:20.66]You need to... You need to beat yourself.
[97:24.48]in a staring contest if one of you blinks the shotgun rigged to the back of your head will go off make your choice I like it
[97:50.36]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[97:51.04]Unwinnable, unwinnable.
[97:52.20]Oh, yeah?
[97:53.00]Well, somebody just said it.
[97:54.98]You break the glass with your fist.
[97:57.74]You have to break the glass and take the mirror out.
[98:01.08]That's winnable.
[98:01.56]Alright, so we have... Look at the mirror or you'll get killed.
[98:16.53]We have the waiting room.
[98:19.36]Obviously, how do these people... Do they have to be put somewhere while the stuff is being made?
[98:28.26]He comes in.
[98:28.84]It's like a doctor's office.
[98:30.48]Okay, it's time for Mike.
[98:32.92]Mike, come with me.
[98:34.10]Yeah.
[98:34.62]Oh, yeah.
[98:34.84]How are you doing?
[98:35.20]Yeah, we're going to be on this one on the left.
[98:37.14]Yeah, sunny day.
[98:37.84]Yeah, it's very sunny.
[98:39.44]Yep, go ahead and sit in there.
[98:40.36]Yeah, don't mind the bugs.
[98:42.18]Yeah, it needs to be a waiting room.
[98:48.48]Cry, cry, cry.
[98:49.78]It's an escape room.
[98:50.76]I don't know what the, what's the trap gonna be in here?
[98:58.20]Saw waiting room.
[99:01.14]I gotta, hold on.
[99:04.15]When are you gonna do a tax stream?
[99:06.13]What is with everybody wanting to see, like, people's, like, why is everybody obsessed with tax stream?
[99:11.33]Do your taxes on stream.
[99:18.08]Okay, is like a do your taxes on stream thing a way to be like, oh, hey, haha, I can't wait to see like literally your social security number, your address, everything that, haha, yeah, do your taxes on stream.
[99:26.19]That's like, show the first page though.
[99:28.13]Can I see the first page?
[99:29.49]Yeah, would you spend money on this here?
[99:31.61]Haha, what's that in the top?
[99:32.77]Let me like screenshot the top right for a second.
[99:36.07]You serious?
[99:44.82]Just do it in a dark room.
[99:52.58]Why?
[99:52.78]You want me to make like a doing my taxes on stream a scary stream?
[99:55.86]I don't want that.
[99:58.98]That's weird.
[100:00.06]I already have to do the Family Guy Peter Griffin family dinner stream.
[100:09.03]I'm gonna do that, by the way.
[100:10.87]I will, okay, I promise, before I don't stream ever again, I promise, before my final stream, whenever that is, I'm going to do the Family Guy family dinner stream.
[100:26.46]Because, you know what, like, eventually, if I planned on, like, retiring, right, what do I say to myself?
[100:34.40]Okay, like, I'm gonna do the Family Guy family dinner stream, because, like, who cares?
[100:39.86]What if everybody fucking hates it and you lose a bunch of, like, respect?
[100:42.46]What?
[100:42.88]Whatever.
[100:45.58]Like, I'm retiring in, like, six months anyways.
[100:53.33]Don't retire, idiot.
[100:55.65]Hey, what?
[101:03.39]Don't ever retire.
[101:08.07]I kind of want to put a surrounded room with these.
[101:10.39]Yeah, that's another trap room.
[101:13.67]Surrounded by glass.
[101:14.93]Very breakable.
[101:15.95]What we don't know is all the glass, when it breaks, will trigger gas into the room.
[101:24.28]Something, something, something, something, gas.
[101:26.14]Something.
[101:27.58]Something.
[101:28.36]This is going to be something.
[101:29.16]Gas.
[101:29.72]Something.
[101:30.14]Gas.
[101:33.10]You have 10 minutes.
[101:33.72]You have 5 minutes.
[101:34.46]Gas.
[101:42.13]Gas.
[101:44.67]You have five minutes.
[101:45.29]Gas.
[101:45.77]You have two minutes to gas.
[101:47.23]Why does it sound weird?
[101:49.56]Gas.
[101:50.62]Gas.
[101:52.70]No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[101:56.72]Gas.
[101:58.16]Gas.
[102:01.52]In ten minutes, gas will fill the room.
[102:04.25]You have only ten minutes to escape the gas.
[102:07.07]In this room, there's gas.
[102:08.79]If you breathe in the gas, you're gonna die.
[102:12.41]Around your neck is a key.
[102:14.03]You need to unlock.
[102:15.99]The device around your neck arouses gas.
[102:17.69]We'll enter the room.
[102:18.53]Don't breathe the gas.
[102:23.87]I have filled this room with gas, and not the gas that you are used to.
[102:28.09]I filled this room with sewer gas.
[102:30.48]It stinks.
[102:34.80]In this room, I farted gas.
[102:36.98]In this room, it is full of fart gas.
[102:39.36]Don't breathe in the gas.
[102:45.80]Poopoo funny, haha.
[102:48.24]Get rid of this fucking toy.
[102:53.75]Okay, so yeah.
[102:57.21]What about this room?
[102:57.75]This room has gas in it.
[103:04.74]Ugh.
[103:08.08]Hold on, okay.
[103:09.52]I know what I'm going to do in this room.
[103:11.85]This room is going to be the room with the gross trash all over the place and disgusting things.
[103:17.57]You must sit inside of this room for five minutes without puking into the toilet.
[103:23.60]If you throw up in that toilet, yes, I'll enter the room.
[103:42.56]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[103:43.70]I'm distracting myself.
[103:46.78]This is just his bedroom.
[103:47.74]Okay, this is where he sees everything from.
[103:49.90]We're gonna put like TV monitors everywhere in here.
[103:51.85]We're gonna put like a control room.
[103:54.11]And a microphone on the desk.
[103:57.63]Here's the control room.
[103:59.20]We have the waiting room.
[104:00.38]It's over here.
[104:00.88]Let me block this off.
[104:12.35]Skill point, huh?
[104:17.29]Saw on a budget.
[104:18.31]Just guess.
[104:27.68]I feel like that would be hard to do, though.
[104:29.12]Alright, we did... So this is the... This is the entrance.
[104:39.05]This house has to be like red.
[104:41.93]Blood red or like just black, right?
[104:46.04]And then this takes you to the waiting room.
[104:47.74]This is going to be a wall here.
[104:48.74]Okay, so there's going to be a wall here.
[104:51.70]We need a... Let me block this out.
[104:54.44]This is a room over here with bugs in it.
[104:58.11]Show your ass that this is pre-recorded.
[105:01.35]Um, no.
[105:05.79]Board the windows up.
[105:09.97]I gotta pee.
[105:10.69]I'll be right back.
[105:11.91]Pee time.
[105:19.39]Oh, fuck.
[105:20.08]I was... Oh, fuck.
[105:21.52]I have a... I have... Shit.
[105:24.44]Oh, fuck.
[105:24.98]I forgot.
[105:25.32]I have a new thing.
[105:26.44]Oh, shit.
[105:26.90]I didn't get it ready.
[105:27.62]Fuck.
[105:32.40]I did get it ready.
[105:33.62]Yes, I did.
[105:35.44]Ladies and gentlemen...
[105:37.45]I am pleased to present, I am pleased to announce a new BRB screen.
[105:46.84]Lots of people are asking what was going to happen to the community content artwork.
[105:53.00]Well, ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you the new and improved BRB screen with artwork that cycles
[106:06.60]What do you say about that?
[106:08.60]I'll be right back.
[106:11.60]Yes!
[106:14.91]You can thank Lazy Luke for putting this together.
[106:19.09]And you can also thank Yen Wen for making the animation here.
[106:22.01]This is going to cycle through artwork.
[106:26.47]Take a look at that.
[106:27.24]I love it!
[106:30.04]It's beautiful!
[106:35.14]It works flawlessly, too.
[106:38.77]So here is how we will get a bunch of artwork.
[106:46.76]How awesome is this?
[106:47.90]How good is this?
[106:49.12]Isn't it insane?
[106:57.54]I'll be right back.
[106:58.92]Enjoy the art.
[107:00.57]Oh, oh, oh.
[108:45.48]There's a lot of shoe artwork backlog.
[108:52.24]Is that another shoe?
[108:54.43]I love it.
[108:58.27]It showed porn?
[108:59.31]No, it did not.
[109:03.24]Uh, Lazy Luke is the one that's programming all this.
[109:07.07]It's so good, too.
[109:08.11]You know what I mean?
[109:08.77]Like, can we give a huge, huge shout-out to Lazy Luke for doing all this?
[109:14.65]It's so good.
[109:24.04]It's amazing.
[109:24.76]Because there's so much artwork, and some of you guys...
[109:29.54]Like, you guys are so talented.
[109:32.00]So many of you guys can make such crazy shit.
[109:36.74]I wanted to find a way to at least showcase it.
[109:39.44]If I could.
[109:41.78]I disappeared for like three months.
[109:42.98]It was a huge backlog.
[109:44.12]Huge community content night that just could not happen.
[109:49.45]Videos for community content night, I'm going to have to figure out a solution for too because I don't think I can do those on Twitch anymore.
[109:55.37]But I wanted to have something.
[109:58.57]And this is the something.
[110:00.03]And it is awesome.
[110:04.29]Too many of you do too many awesome things to not show.
[110:08.02]So... Why not?
[110:11.18]Well... The DMCA uncertainty has kind of thrown a wrench into that.
[110:19.60]So there's either going to have to be a lot tighter rules on what can be shown...
[110:27.12]Or... Why?
[110:36.13]Is this a family tree?
[110:41.31]It's art breeder?
[110:47.68]Don't make them clippable or vaudible.
[110:49.20]But if I stream them, they still exist and they can still be pulled, right?
[110:53.31]I have a couple of solutions in mind.
[110:56.00]When I'm ready to talk about those, I will.
[111:06.46]Alright, I'm back, but I just wanted to let this play out a little bit just so we could see how cool it was.
[111:17.42]And the best part is this is constantly updated.
[111:22.17]So it should pick up kind of where I leave off.
[111:26.77]Which is awesome.
[111:32.93]I never ate ass from the start.
[111:34.63]The truth is.
[111:35.15]That's true.
[111:37.73]Wait, did I just... Oh, shit.
[111:38.87]I just gave a definitive answer.
[111:40.79]The two, three year long question.
[111:43.62]Oh, shit.
[111:44.86]Oops.
[111:48.58]Alright, let's go.
[111:49.40]Let's go.
[111:56.57]I want to test something.
[111:57.35]I want to see if I screwed something up.
[111:58.93]I might have messed something up.
[112:01.38]Let me see if I got it right.
[112:03.00]I might have screwed it up.
[112:10.08]Oh, would you look at that?
[112:11.04]It works perfectly.
[112:12.28]It works absolutely fucking flawlessly.
[112:15.77]It picks up exactly where the last image left off.
[112:23.35]Look at that.
[112:26.34]Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
[112:32.38]Okay.
[112:36.22]I'm so happy about that.
[112:37.50]It looks great.
[112:38.98]It looks so good.
[112:45.96]Why is it so dark?
[112:54.42]So the idea, there are hundreds of images that are in the backlog.
[112:58.92]The idea is over time, you can enjoy them during a BRB segment, right?
[113:03.30]Because I don't run ads.
[113:05.61]So if I don't run ads when I go BRB, then show those and that's much more interesting, right?
[113:11.45]Alright, here we go.
[113:16.37]We need a big lamp too, not these.
[113:18.77]I'm going to leave these for now just because I need light in the house.
[113:26.32]I just got a Hearthstone ad.
[113:28.82]I don't think I can control that.
[113:32.52]Didn't Twitch make it so like ads just have to get shown or something?
[113:35.36]I don't want to do that.
[113:38.52]But it might have to be like that.
[113:40.36]Okay, this is the puke room.
[113:47.52]This is the fold the t-shirts or else, you know, that certain fluid will enter the room.
[113:52.83]Yes.
[114:03.37]Why is this here?
[114:04.33]That needs to go away.
[114:05.05]Get rid of this door.
[114:10.05]Hang your coat up.
[114:11.56]Hang your coat up when you come in, please.
[114:14.54]Not gonna need it, trust me.
[114:15.58]Yeah, it's a weird door.
[114:20.06]I don't like it.
[114:29.55]Coat hanger of death.
[114:36.66]What a welcome rug.
[114:39.06]Oh, there is a welcome rug.
[114:40.16]Alright.
[114:44.64]That's my favorite Warhammer faction.
[114:46.24]The Tau.
[114:49.08]Sorry, that's Warhammer 40,000.
[114:50.18]The Tau, just because of... I like the hero the best.
[115:13.27]I just like their units.
[115:13.87]I like the infantry units.
[115:16.44]They're awesome.
[115:16.80]You know what's the worst part about the Tau?
[115:21.10]They put the Tau in a game.
[115:22.90]They made that Warhammer 40k real-time strategy game, right?
[115:26.72]They added a couple of expansions to it.
[115:29.80]And then they never put them in anything else ever again.
[115:33.00]I would have played Dawn of War 2 if the Tau were an actual playable faction.
[115:43.17]And then they made Dawn of War 3 and nobody played it.
[115:45.65]So they, like, canned it, right?
[115:50.75]Stop cleaning.
[115:51.29]Fuck, you're right.
[115:51.83]Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[115:52.57]I can add dirt.
[115:53.10]Don't worry.
[115:58.66]And now they're probably never going to make a Dawn of War 4.
[116:00.46]Ever.
[116:03.38]Okay, let's go.
[116:04.85]Get rid of this.
[116:05.97]Doesn't need to be here.
[116:07.33]All the rooms are going to be so ugly.
[116:08.49]Don't worry.
[116:11.84]This is... Okay, this is the puke room.
[116:15.10]This is the... Not the torture room.
[116:19.20]This is... Okay, what is this?
[116:20.47]This is the bedroom.
[116:21.15]This is where... Okay, let's do this room now.
[116:27.83]This is the saw room.
[116:32.71]Oh, sorry.
[116:33.19]This is the jigsaw room.
[116:37.14]I need a nice big computer desk.
[116:47.87]Mmm.
[116:49.37]He just sleeps on a bunk bed?
[116:52.39]Give him a ceiling TV.
[116:59.26]No, he's gonna have a corner desk.
[117:00.98]Here we go.
[117:02.18]He's like nice and dark.
[117:11.06]Right here.
[117:13.00]Oh, I gotta move the bed.
[117:14.62]This is too big.
[117:15.28]It's too big.
[117:24.94]Okay, here we go.
[117:25.76]Now we need a bunch of devices.
[117:26.82]We need a bunch of keyboards and mice and... Oh, we need cameras.
[117:32.12]Right?
[117:32.32]There's no, like, security camera?
[117:38.46]Really?
[117:39.04]There's no security cameras?
[117:42.47]What?
[117:46.05]Give him a sex swing.
[117:53.92]No.
[117:54.68]Webcam.
[117:59.53]Webcams all over the place?
[118:01.69]This is so stupid.
[118:02.99]I need to sit on a shelf.
[118:23.16]Okay, we'll put a camera here.
[118:24.42]What's my favorite Warcraft faction?
[118:29.50]Um... I don't know.
[118:40.10]I don't know.
[118:40.44]I don't know.
[118:43.31]The... Um... Uh... No, it's not orcs.
[118:49.17]Not humans.
[118:53.10]Goblins.
[118:54.58]It's the goblins.
[118:55.22]I don't know why it took me that long to say that.
[118:57.42]Goblins.
[119:04.68]We're not talking about Warcraft right now.
[119:08.90]I didn't buy Shadowlands.
[119:11.46]I'm not going to play Shadowlands.
[119:12.76]I don't own Shadowlands.
[119:14.00]Why would I buy Shadowlands?
[119:15.21]Why would I ever play Shadowlands?
[119:16.89]What would the point be?
[119:18.57]I'm not going to play Shadowlands.
[119:21.21]Are you serious?
[119:23.40]No, fuck that.
[119:24.20]I'm never gonna play that game.
[119:25.10]Never gonna buy it.
[119:25.58]I didn't buy it.
[119:26.20]Why would I buy it?
[119:26.68]I've never bought it.
[119:27.26]I don't own it.
[119:39.18]Oh, you bought Shadowlands.
[119:40.64]Of course I didn't.
[119:41.56]Why would I buy Shadowlands?
[119:44.66]Okay.
[119:48.11]Look, no, ban that person.
[119:49.25]Like, actually ban that person.
[119:50.43]Like, you're gonna say that to me?
[119:52.35]Okay.
[119:53.45]He bought Shadowlands and he plays it.
[119:54.99]No, he doesn't.
[119:55.49]Oh my god, ban everyone that says that.
[119:56.97]Why would I buy that?
[119:59.51]Shut up.
[119:59.85]Oh no, he's lighting us.
[120:22.14]Uh, any one of these.
[121:06.68]I wrote it so many times No, this is just this is like propane It's not even the gas that we're talking about.
[121:22.24]This is just actually gas for your grill
[121:29.19]If you don't cook that steak perfectly on the gas grill, if you don't cook that steak perfectly on the gas grill, then your food's not going to taste good.
[121:38.47]Then I'm going to gas you.
[121:41.16]I'm not going to do any more gas references anymore.
[121:47.08]No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more.
[121:55.10]You know the best part about this whole little routine here?
[121:57.66]I don't think I've even said it the amount of times that they actually say it in the Saw movies.
[122:03.21]If you count the amount of times that the word gas has been said this stream, I bet you they said it more times over the course of that series.
[122:15.90]Why is it so hard to... That...
[122:23.77]Okay, this bet is weird because somebody's gonna have to watch all 18 Saw movies back to back and put a timestamp of every time they say the word gas.
[122:35.84]Who the hell, who's, none of, nobody wants to do that.
[122:38.18]That's like 30 hours of time.
[122:42.98]Just control F the script.
[122:47.40]I will, I'll do it.
[122:49.21]No, no, that's too much.
[122:54.14]But what if there's ad-libbing of the word gas?
[122:57.35]What if it's not the whole thing?
[122:58.61]What if it's ad-libbed?
[123:02.87]There's definitely a few ad-libbing times.
[123:05.13]They walk in the room, they go, Smells like gas in here!
[123:08.21]And that wasn't in the script.
[123:12.47]Alright, okay.
[123:14.07]Okay.
[123:14.65]Alright, but... I don't want you all to do this, because if you all do it, then that means a bunch of you are spending 30 hours doing this.
[123:23.95]We have to designate one person to do this.
[123:29.43]I'm willing to put up.
[123:33.20]I'm willing to put up.
[123:34.28]Okay.
[123:35.30]No, no, no.
[123:38.16]Two.
[123:39.40]Alright.
[123:41.04]This is $250 million if I'm wrong.
[123:43.30]Add it to the debt.
[123:44.88]If I'm right.
[123:46.78]Pull it.
[123:47.86]And I get that.
[123:48.20]$250 million.
[124:00.62]Oh, is that a deal?
[124:01.48]Is that a deal?
[124:02.62]Alright, who does this?
[124:07.84]Who's going to be doing this?
[124:12.32]I already did it.
[124:13.60]You did?
[124:13.92]Maybe in the Discord, maybe some of you guys corroborate on doing it.
[124:28.24]Gas doesn't appear once in the original movie's script.
[124:33.64]What?
[124:38.59]Okay, Holm, this is the first part of the script.
[124:41.49]Greetings and welcome.
[124:43.35]I trust that you are all wondering where you are.
[124:45.93]I can assure you that while your location is not important, what these walls offer for you is important.
[124:52.98]Salvation.
[124:54.78]If you earn it,
[124:56.10]Three hours from now, the door to this house will open.
[124:59.14]Unfortunately, you only have two hours to live.
[125:05.50]Right now, you're breathing in a deadly nerve agent.
[125:08.58]You've been breathing it since you arrived.
[125:09.90]That counts as gas.
[125:11.38]That counts as... Nerve agent counts as gas.
[125:14.62]Nerve agent counts.
[125:16.34]That counts.
[125:17.98]You gotta give me a feel.
[125:19.38]Yes, it does.
[125:20.12]Yes, it does.
[125:22.24]Breathe... Okay, if he says the word breathing in...
[125:28.76]If the words breathe in a certain fume that is a gas-like fume.
[125:34.92]Nerve gas.
[125:35.66]Come on.
[125:37.97]He probably says that like 30 times throughout that movie.
[125:40.97]You have to give me that one.
[125:41.95]It counts.
[125:42.39]It does count.
[125:46.95]It totally is a gas, chat.
[125:48.51]Yeah, come on.
[125:51.70]No, that counts.
[125:56.84]The word breathing comes up eight times and isn't related to gas.
[126:05.23]Yes, it is.
[126:05.93]Why would you say the word's breathing?
[126:09.09]What is he saying?
[126:10.03]What is he referring to?
[126:11.05]What you're breathing in right now is fresh air.
[126:15.43]I opened up the window to make sure you got some fresh air so you could breathe in the fresh air.
[126:19.35]Hey, breathe in the scented candles.
[126:23.51]Are you kidding me?
[126:24.09]No, every time he says the words breathing in, that counts.
[126:26.91]I'm sorry, I'm going to pull the deal if that's not true.
[126:33.18]What else would you be breathing in in the Saw movie franchise?
[126:38.56]It's not a car air freshener.
[126:43.26]Oh, that counts, that counts.
[126:44.44]Breathing in fume, breathing in gas, breathing in nerve agent, those are all considered gaseous, gastric-like objects.
[126:56.75]They're not breathing, they're dead.
[126:58.35]Right, okay.
[127:00.29]You can take that one off.
[127:05.29]But if it's a reference to inhaling a fume that will hurt you, that is a reference.
[127:11.75]It is a reference and you cannot tell me it isn't.
[127:21.57]If whatever you're breathing in hurts, it's gas.
[127:26.07]You're gonna lose immediately.
[127:27.27]Come... What?
[127:30.35]Wasn't part of the deal.
[127:31.45]No, it's part of the deal.
[127:33.09]You said the word gas.
[127:34.55]Yeah, but like we have to adjust.
[127:40.77]The deal was about the word.
[127:41.99]No, come on.
[127:46.02]Sorry, sorry.
[127:46.78]Nerve agent.
[127:49.86]Nerve agent.
[127:50.64]Yes, nerve agent.
[127:52.52]Give me a break.
[127:55.15]What is it?
[127:55.71]Okay, let me ask a chat.
[127:56.85]Let me ask you a question.
[127:58.43]What is a nerve agent?
[128:01.55]What is it?
[128:04.45]What is it?
[128:09.44]It can be liquid.
[128:10.44]Interesting.
[128:11.06]That's not liquid in that movie.
[128:12.58]It's a poisonous one.
[128:15.92]Toothpaste.
[128:16.34]No, it's not.
[128:17.62]Nerve agents can be aerosol.
[128:20.40]Vapor.
[128:21.93]Now, what is vapor?
[128:23.87]Vapor is gas.
[128:25.15]It's water that's been turned into gas.
[128:29.45]Now, we're not playing semantics with this one.
[128:31.01]You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[128:32.45]Alright, here we go.
[128:37.91]I gotta continue my sawhouse.
[128:41.85]Nerve agent is not gas.
[128:45.01]It's gas.
[128:49.61]Yes, it is.
[128:50.75]That's exactly what I was talking about.
[128:53.19]If he says the word nerve agent 20 times in that movie and you don't give it to me, I'm going to be very upset with that.
[129:16.62]You said it more than 20 times.
[129:18.13]Yeah, I said it over the course of the entire franchise.
[129:26.31]I didn't say in Saw 1.
[129:40.43]Saw Filter?
[129:43.32]Play the game with the Saw Filter.
[129:46.71]No, no, that's gonna ruin it.
[129:58.53]Wait, it's on.
[129:59.77]Oh, shit.
[130:02.63]Fuck.
[130:07.86]I thought you were saying turn it on for the rest of the stream and it would have stayed on.
[130:17.82]Shit.
[130:18.53]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[130:23.55]You're arguing with Saw about how he lost a bet that he didn't say the word gas or nerve agent in his own movies.
[130:32.68]What a bizarre stream this turned into.
[130:35.14]Okay.
[130:38.04]I need a door.
[130:39.10]They gotta be, yeah, like scary metal doors.
[130:49.05]Isn't there like a scary door?
[130:50.17]Yup.
[130:52.72]Scary metal door.
[130:56.54]Not big enough?
[130:57.08]What?
[131:08.39]Oh, tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
[131:09.85]Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
[131:12.19]Oh, shit.
[131:12.53]Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
[131:13.89]Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
[131:18.71]Oh.
[131:18.81]Oh.
[131:29.30]It was a month ago.
[131:30.64]In Canada.
[131:31.18]Oh, well, happy Thanksgiving in Canada.
[131:37.41]You mean pre-Christmas.
[131:38.81]Well, I mean Thanksgiving.
[131:39.87]Alright, so now I gotta open up this wall a little.
[131:43.33]Because this is the waiting room, right?
[131:52.98]I like Thanksgiving.
[131:54.46]People hands.
[131:59.40]Yeah, there has to be cameras in here, too.
[132:05.50]I'm thankful for this stream.
[132:06.76]Hey, thanks.
[132:07.92]I'm thankful for you being here and hanging out here.
[132:11.95]Thanks for hanging out here.
[132:13.91]And welcome.
[132:18.39]Thanks.
[132:21.97]Thanks.
[132:26.42]I didn't even buy Shadowlands.
[132:27.84]What?
[132:28.30]Haha.
[132:36.63]Wait, should the waiting room have a normal door?
[132:43.15]What's over here?
[132:44.54]Oh, wait, this is the secret room.
[132:46.44]No, no, this is the puke room.
[132:48.20]I gotta get rid of this.
[132:57.90]The waiting room should have a normal door.
[133:06.62]Didn't they make a new Saw?
[133:09.06]But it's not called Saw.
[133:11.94]It's part of, like, the Saw series or something, right?
[133:16.98]It's coming out soon.
[133:20.64]What's it called?
[133:22.36]It has a completely different name.
[133:24.20]Not Jigsaw.
[133:24.78]No, no, no.
[133:25.32]Spiral, yeah.
[133:26.16]The movie's called Spiral, and it's in the Saw universe, but it's not Saw.
[133:43.94]Spiral.
[133:45.60]Not Spyro.
[133:46.68]Yeah, it's got Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson.
[133:51.87]I feel like I kind of want to watch that movie.
[133:57.49]What was I doing?
[133:58.01]Oh, door, door.
[134:05.90]Uh, how about this?
[134:08.04]This looks nice.
[134:22.46]Terrible.
[134:24.92]Too many buttons.
[134:25.66]Too many buttons.
[134:26.16]I don't like it.
[134:26.54]Too many buttons.
[134:27.90]Too many buttons.
[134:37.15]There.
[134:40.81]That looks nice.
[134:41.29]This is the waiting room.
[134:46.65]Should there be TVs that are showing everyone else getting, like, tortured?
[134:50.53]No, no, no, no.
[134:51.19]That's a spoiler.
[134:51.73]Spoiler.
[135:00.13]Okay, I need some paint.
[135:02.18]Let's make this look nice.
[135:05.24]What's a waiting room?
[135:05.82]What color is a waiting room?
[135:15.64]Where's the paint?
[135:18.50]I have the paint brush.
[135:21.90]Wait.
[135:24.86]Do I not have the paint brush?
[135:26.20]Oh, I do.
[135:26.52]Okay, okay.
[135:30.45]Where's paint?
[135:33.11]Walls, right?
[135:35.64]Okay, waiting room would be... Like a white?
[135:41.22]Like a beige?
[135:42.78]Biscuit?
[135:43.30]Natural beige?
[135:53.19]Dunk it?
[135:57.98]There's a virus link.
[135:59.56]Don't link virus links.
[136:04.30]Dude, I gotta tell you.
[136:06.52]We have a lot of... There's a big... I've gotta be one of the only people on Twitch that allows people just to put links in chat.
[136:15.43]You guys have been very, very good about it.
[136:20.05]Don't ruin it now.
[136:30.09]I got a virus.
[136:30.91]What the fuck?
[136:32.67]No.
[136:33.61]You didn't, because I know that didn't happen.
[136:40.12]I got a virus.
[136:42.54]I did.
[136:43.90]Don't get a virus.
[136:44.70]Go ahead.
[136:46.18]I know.
[136:46.44]I just said that.
[136:47.12]I know.
[136:47.44]But just hear me out.
[136:49.46]Don't click links.
[136:53.02]Don't click random links is the new... Don't answer the phone that you don't recognize.
[137:08.80]Don't pick up your phone if you don't recognize the phone number.
[137:11.16]If they, if they need, they'll leave it, they'll go to voicemail.
[137:13.46]If they're so important.
[137:19.16]Like, oh, let me look at my phone.
[137:20.28]Who is this calling?
[137:21.84]Uh, it's a random number from an area code I've never fucking heard of.
[137:25.71]Not gonna answer that.
[137:26.33]Nice clean window.
[137:50.20]Yes.
[137:51.82]Paintings and stuff.
[137:52.82]I want better couches in this.
[137:54.25]There are people looking to line up to buy this house.
[138:01.51]Why?
[138:09.60]Can somebody look at my Twitch statistics and see if this is the most time I've ever played on a game on stream?
[138:16.94]I'm curious if it is.
[138:18.34]I feel like it probably is.
[138:21.35]Alright, uh, I want, I like different lights.
[138:28.69]Somehow, I think Red Dead Redemption 2 is high up on that list.
[138:32.89]I don't know how.
[138:36.11]Different couches.
[138:36.61]Hmm.
[138:47.54]Do I have a Nickelodeon SNCC couch?
[138:51.43]We've got an epic link in chat, do we?
[139:09.18]Right.
[139:10.38]But, no, this is not fair.
[139:12.32]This isn't fair.
[139:17.46]Number of times a character says the word gas in all the Saw movies.
[139:22.98]saw one zero saw two four they don't say it again until saw seven and they say it three times but what about the other stuff like nerve agent or fumes or toxic fume it's got to be like 20 times no no that come on that doesn't count
[139:48.70]You need to verify your sources.
[139:51.08]Yeah, like this is an English project.
[139:57.82]Somebody just do it again, but then run it through to see how many times the word nerve agent, nerve fumes, fumes, poison, toxic.
[140:10.12]There's a poison coursing through your nose, right?
[140:12.88]Come on, do it.
[140:13.86]Somebody do it.
[140:22.52]Gashes, yeah.
[140:29.43]They only use gas in Saw 2.
[140:31.27]No, they don't.
[140:32.39]They use gas in the whole franchise.
[140:36.03]He's always making people smell gas.
[140:47.91]They either smell gas or they have to get a key out of their stomach.
[140:55.77]Is this a dog couch?
[140:57.23]Oh.
[140:58.91]Never mind.
[140:59.35]Give me something else.
[141:08.95]There.
[141:09.43]This is nice.
[141:11.25]We'll make it a nice wood color.
[141:37.76]Wait, do you have another one?
[141:39.16]Did somebody do it?
[141:39.80]I don't know what I clicked on.
[141:41.84]I don't know what I clicked on.
[141:42.52]I don't know what I clicked on.
[141:43.26]I don't know what I clicked on.
[141:55.83]Hey.
[141:58.25]Hey, wake up.
[142:01.14]Hey.
[142:04.38]Can you hear me?
[142:08.19]There's one.
[142:08.93]Two.
[142:37.29]Three
[143:05.26]Or... You... That's not fair.
[143:06.68]That's not fair.
[143:08.00]It's a nerve agent.
[143:08.68]He probably says the word nerve 2,500 times in that movie.
[143:40.18]I should have said anything like nerve, gas, nerve agent, fume.
[143:45.42]Why?
[143:46.00]Why?
[143:46.34]Alright, the waiting room is good.
[143:52.54]I need a little table here.
[143:54.95]Okay, how many times does it say the word fumes?
[143:58.49]How many times does it say?
[143:59.77]Paint fumes.
[144:01.29]I have opened up a bunch of new paints from Home Depot.
[144:04.09]If you stay in this room for more than a few minutes...
[144:07.95]The paint fumes are going to make you feel like shit.
[144:13.31]It probably does something like that, right?
[144:16.01]God damn it.
[144:16.69]Whatever.
[144:16.99]3 billion.
[144:18.19]No, it's like 2.9 billion.
[144:19.75]Whatever.
[144:20.29]I don't have that much money.
[144:22.03]Whatever.
[144:22.40]I don't have that much money.
[144:24.94]Fumes.
[144:31.66]In this room, I've cooked 16 pounds of bacon.
[144:37.88]But you are smelling right now of bacon fumes.
[144:41.88]Enough to a point to make you sick to your stomach.
[144:45.47]You probably smelled it all the way upstairs when I was cooking it.
[144:48.91]You got really excited.
[144:51.47]You rushed down the stairs only to be locked into the room.
[144:54.93]It's too much fumes.
[145:02.66]There's probably something like that in those movies.
[145:04.42]He definitely says it like... How many times did I do it?
[145:06.60]Like a hundred?
[145:18.00]There we go.
[145:18.70]Cool.
[145:19.32]I thought somebody was out the window.
[145:24.60]Very cool.
[145:25.26]Nice little waiting room.
[145:26.62]Cool.
[145:28.38]Oh, what's in this room?
[145:30.22]Oh, this is the staring contest with yourself where you get shotgunned in the head.
[145:34.19]Right.
[145:34.41]Okay.
[145:46.97]This room needs to be way smaller.
[145:52.72]Hold on.
[145:53.46]I can... I'll change this.
[145:59.82]This room needs to be ten times smaller.
[146:17.72]Here.
[146:19.92]Gas, gas, gas, gas.
[146:27.12]What?
[146:28.82]This is like a soundtrack.
[146:32.71]It just linked me a soundtrack.
[146:34.03]It was like an hour and 30 minutes.
[146:42.43]Jerma noise mixtape.
[146:48.08]This video is three minutes long.
[146:50.75]I've actually seen...
[147:12.59]Is this every noise I've ever made?
[147:39.84]Do it at x2 speed.
[147:41.25]I feel like I'm hurting people.
[147:42.37]Am I hurting people?
[147:44.94]I feel like this hurts.
[147:45.66]Is everyone okay?
[148:03.73]Somebody let out all the bugs.
[148:06.11]Somebody let out all the cartoon bugs.
[148:20.90]I can't, I can't listen to this anymore.
[148:22.68]I can't listen to this one anymore.
[148:24.04]I can't.
[148:24.80]This is too, this is too much.
[148:26.63]I'll do 0.5 for a second.
[148:40.97]What?
[148:42.29]What the fuck?
[148:45.03]What did he say?
[148:51.51]This video has 10,000 views.
[148:53.43]And it was uploaded yesterday.
[148:59.74]What?
[149:06.92]Here it is if you want it.
[149:08.90]I don't know if I... I can't handle the other two or three minutes of that video.
[149:15.47]Alright, back to what we were doing.
[149:20.40]That's my workout jam.
[149:24.09]Wait, wait, we have a link.
[149:24.77]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[149:26.17]We're getting swarmed with links.
[149:27.45]It's a new offer.
[149:30.29]All synonyms off.
[149:31.55]What?
[149:33.50]I need to look at this.
[149:38.38]Is this a new offer?
[149:39.18]Okay, hold on.
[149:42.22]Let me see if I want to take this or not.
[149:44.47]New offer.
[149:46.32]All synonyms of, or in words related to gas, count as gas in the Saw movies.
[149:51.90]But it's only 75 million instead of 250 million.
[149:55.63]And the Saw guys must say it more than half the number of times you've said gas for you to win.
[150:06.87]I'm getting a lot of no deals here.
[150:08.17]Sorry.
[150:10.47]I gotta change this.
[150:11.09]I gotta move this.
[150:14.81]That sounds like a good deal for me.
[150:24.69]I need a shelf.
[150:33.17]This is so stupid.
[150:39.37]You could just lean back when it fires.
[150:41.67]It's gonna have to be a wall.
[151:08.19]Okay.
[151:10.23]Shotgun.
[151:16.53]Come on.
[151:17.89]What the fuck?
[151:20.05]Gonna be bigger?
[151:27.16]I'm not opening up any more links.
[151:30.22]Okay, when you're sitting down like this.
[151:33.98]You'd be sitting like here.
[151:42.25]Like this.
[151:46.59]There needs to be more than one shotgun?
[151:48.23]Okay.
[152:11.19]Alright, that's fine.
[152:15.01]This is fucked up.
[152:16.22]Okay, this is fucked up.
[152:18.06]But it's a saw room.
[152:19.00]Okay.
[152:23.24]Does it make a sink over here?
[152:24.24]Okay, now I can... Let's make this room a lot smaller.
[152:28.28]So it's gonna go like this.
[152:31.11]I mean, if you'll get in this and sit down.
[152:36.53]So let's go over here.
[152:40.81]You're ignoring chat.
[152:43.63]Yeah, I'll put a bunch of TVs in the saw room.
[152:54.98]Fringe mode activated.
[152:56.82]Me?
[152:58.12]What'd I do?
[153:00.48]What'd I do?
[153:03.46]What'd I do?
[153:03.86]Okay, here we go.
[153:12.39]Okay, this room is almost done.
[153:13.27]Just need to put a bunch of gross stuff everywhere.
[153:17.59]Okay.
[153:19.79]Wall off the window?
[153:24.02]You cringed by being yourself.
[153:27.30]Hey.
[153:27.40]What are you on about?
[153:33.62]The shotgun's a tad too high.
[153:36.32]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[153:37.01]Let me lower it a little bit.
[153:38.23]Thanks for pointing that out.
[153:44.70]Okay.
[153:46.05]Let's do paint.
[153:51.27]We need something that's dark and mysterious.
[153:54.55]Scary.
[153:57.59]Paint.
[154:00.40]Blood red.
[154:07.06]New deal?
[154:07.50]No, new deals don't make any sense unless all of you agree to the new deal.
[154:14.94]You have to all agree to the new deal.
[154:20.27]Especially if you're throwing around 2, 3, 4, 500 million deals.
[154:35.52]Yeah, what was it?
[154:36.04]Anything over 500 million has to be voted on a straw poll.
[154:42.05]I'm going to make this a different color.
[154:47.42]Red and... Something else.
[154:50.95]Something else.
[154:54.39]Something.
[154:55.65]Gray.
[154:57.29]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[155:05.33]Finish Jump King DLC for a billion.
[155:07.61]I'm not... I'm never gonna open that game again.
[155:17.58]I'm just being real with everybody.
[155:23.22]I beat the main game.
[155:24.68]I tried the DLC for like 40 minutes.
[155:27.00]And it said I'm never opening this again.
[155:28.44]Okay, that looks fine.
[155:37.78]Does this be black?
[155:39.18]Yeah.
[155:39.64]No.
[155:40.68]This should be black.
[155:44.20]Actual good deal.
[155:44.96]Incredible deal.
[155:45.74]Real deal.
[155:46.28]Good deal.
[155:49.51]This is not even a deal.
[155:50.53]Alright, this is the final link I'm clicking on.
[156:03.86]I'm not clicking on any more links.
[156:09.44]This is the last one I'm clicking on.
[156:17.72]Okay, so this is a deal or no deal?
[156:22.54]What is that, Link?
[156:23.86]Play one round of deal or no deal and get whatever you win off the debt.
[156:31.23]No, fuck that.
[156:32.09]That game sucks.
[156:37.39]It's gonna be $100.
[156:37.85]The chance to win on deal or no deal is so bad.
[156:45.28]It's such a dumb game.
[156:47.64]There's one $1 million case, one $500,000, one $750,000, and one $250,000, right?
[156:53.96]There's 30 cases, isn't there?
[156:56.54]Statistically, you're never going to get those cases.
[156:58.54]Statistically, you're going to get something less than $2,000, $3,000.
[157:01.93]I don't even know how that show exists.
[157:12.27]Winnings are times 100.
[157:13.01]Really?
[157:13.73]Really?
[157:16.86]Winnings times 100.
[157:17.60]Are we okay with that?
[157:27.74]Gameslol.net?
[157:29.46]I don't want... That feels like a fake website.
[157:39.03]Gameslol?
[157:39.97]Alright, I'm taking that deal.
[157:44.19]I'm taking that deal.
[157:46.00]I'll stream that this weekend.
[157:53.30]I'll stream that this weekend.
[157:54.06]That's what we'll do this weekend.
[157:54.80]We'll do some more game show stuff.
[157:59.44]Right now.
[157:59.88]What do you mean right now?
[158:02.44]Right now?
[158:02.99]It has to be now.
[158:08.09]It has to be now?
[158:09.67]Right now.
[158:12.13]What?
[158:12.87]Is that website safe?
[158:14.21]Hold on.
[158:30.19]Deal or no deal game.
[158:35.37]It's msn.com?
[158:42.18]msn.com has one.
[158:46.66]You know what's funny?
[158:47.94]I don't even know which one of those websites would be worse.
[158:52.77]Okay, fine.
[158:53.29]We'll do it now.
[158:53.69]I'm going to do it right now.
[158:55.95]Fine.
[158:56.47]Let's go.
[159:09.91]I gotta turn the volume down on this.
[159:11.17]Hopefully this isn't weird fucking loud.
[159:17.02]No, it's- I- and of course it's like a loud construction ad.
[159:20.92]What the f- hold on.
[159:25.30]Oh my god damn it!
[159:26.62]I knew it!
[159:33.24]Ah!
[159:34.70]Turn off the music before I get in trouble!
[159:40.50]Okay, deal or no deal?
[159:41.50]Let me get it set up.
[159:47.42]So many ads on this website.
[159:49.28]Fuck me, dude.
[159:51.04]Hold on.
[159:51.50]What the fuck?
[160:01.91]Why?
[160:02.29]Is it not even capable?
[160:03.43]I can't even capture this window.
[160:12.78]chrome.exe, there it is, what the fuck, where is it?
[160:20.87]where the fuck is it?
[160:21.51]you guys can't see it new offer come on, capture it why are you doing this?
[160:46.06]No.
[160:46.48]No, no, no.
[160:51.78]Hold on.
[160:53.38]This is annoying.
[161:00.16]Better offer.
[161:00.96]No, no.
[161:01.38]Hold on.
[161:01.74]I'm currently working on another offer right now.
[161:09.89]There it is.
[161:10.37]Alright.
[161:10.69]I'm good.
[161:11.01]I'm ready.
[161:14.57]Okay, I'm about to, let me just turn the music down here.
[161:19.64]Can I get DMCA'd for the Deal or No Deal soundtrack?
[161:23.50]Is that possible?
[161:27.62]Am I going to get in trouble for that?
[161:33.51]I mean, that's possible, right?
[161:42.35]I can't believe we have to think about that.
[161:44.67]That's so annoying.
[161:49.13]Where's this window?
[161:57.45]Alright, here it comes.
[161:58.03]I don't know why this computer is just so fucking terrible.
[162:05.93]I've got to like crop out the ads.
[162:07.79]Hold on.
[162:16.61]It's time for Deal or No Deal.
[162:18.71]This is for 100 times, right?
[162:31.30]Okay.
[162:32.26]I'm ready.
[162:37.11]I'll do the music with my mouth.
[162:41.71]Ow.
[162:41.83]Ow.
[162:49.16]Do a face cam.
[162:50.40]Face cam!
[162:51.60]Oh, put a face cam on!
[162:52.80]Everybody loves face cam!
[162:54.02]Alright, webcam's not even plugged in.
[163:10.50]For one million dollars, are you going to keep that case?
[163:13.52]I don't know.
[163:14.82]Chad, help me.
[163:16.30]Help me, Chad.
[163:17.15]Should I keep the case or should I get another case?
[163:19.89]Where's this webcam?
[163:28.21]There's a sea of wires down here.
[163:33.59]Where is it?
[163:34.07]I got it.
[163:41.63]It's in!
[163:46.66]The controller has been disconnected.
[163:47.88]I don't care.
[163:53.46]Let me put my headphone back in.
[164:04.18]Oh shit, I think my computer froze.
[164:07.31]Don't freeze!
[164:10.24]Okay, hold on.
[164:11.58]Coming.
[164:14.16]I don't have any of this shit set up, ever.
[164:21.60]Oh my god, my hair looks so bad!
[164:23.06]I got a haircut, too, and it looks terrible!
[164:27.80]I gotta put a hat on for this.
[164:37.37]I know I'm stalling, but just give me- hold on.
[164:41.66]No hat, no hat.
[164:42.47]Hold on.
[165:11.07]Okay, it's off.
[165:11.65]I gotta change that.
[165:12.85]Alright, let me get this ready.
[165:17.16]Bad hair?
[165:17.80]Yeah, well, I didn't think I was gonna be on camera today.
[165:19.64]Alright, that should be better.
[165:34.47]Oh, if only I had some hair gel!
[165:37.03]Okay, here we go.
[165:37.83]This is for times of the... Okay, I'm ready.
[165:43.08]Are you ready to go?
[165:43.64]I have to pick my case.
[165:46.58]I'm in the way of the money.
[165:48.78]Whatever.
[165:49.06]Do you really care that much about how much money is left?
[165:50.83]You probably do.
[165:54.03]Okay.
[165:54.19]I'm ready.
[165:57.61]I can't even go anywhere.
[165:58.41]Where can I even go?
[165:59.11]That's not in the way.
[166:01.87]It's a huge delay.
[166:02.69]I just turned it off.
[166:03.49]Look.
[166:03.67]Top right.
[166:08.23]Okay.
[166:10.07]Okay.
[166:10.43]I'm ready.
[166:11.87]Here we go.
[166:13.90]I'm picking case number one.
[166:20.79]Choose six cases.
[166:21.71]20... Alright, which... That's okay.
[166:24.67]21.
[166:24.69]That's a $5.
[166:26.91]That's it.
[166:27.19]Get it out of here. 22.
[166:42.64]Are they fighting in the audience?
[166:43.86]23.
[166:46.46]I still got 750.
[166:46.90]500.
[166:46.92]1 billion.
[166:47.12]I'm good.
[166:47.32]6.
[166:48.94]That's 50.
[166:49.24]Get the low numbers out of here.
[166:53.16]Nice one.
[166:53.48]Deal.
[167:12.37]Oh, that's $100,000.
[167:14.69]That would be $380,000, right?
[167:15.71]Wait, I can do a counter offer?
[167:21.97]Can I counter offer $100,000,000?
[167:26.23]What happened?
[167:27.23]Oh, no deal.
[167:28.09]No deal.
[167:28.45]$19,000.
[167:30.44]What do you mean, nice one?
[167:34.78]That's a good amount of money.
[167:35.92]I don't want to lose that one. $15,000.
[167:41.63]500.
[167:41.67]Get it out of here.
[167:44.47]Two.
[167:50.17]Seven.
[167:53.51]I want to get rid of one cent.
[167:58.66]Eight.
[168:00.52]That's not excellent.
[168:01.80]That's not excellent.
[168:03.10]That's terrible.
[168:03.74]That's horrible.
[168:05.08]No deal.
[168:05.72]Oh, very brave.
[168:07.18]Time for the next round.
[168:09.63]200,000.
[168:09.65]Losing 200,000 to all cases.
[168:10.85]That fucking sucks.
[168:11.39]11.
[168:11.41]Oh my god.
[168:11.83]Okay.
[168:11.93]5.
[168:11.97]That's better.
[168:12.47]Better.
[168:12.63]That's better. 26.
[168:37.79]25.
[168:38.57]25.
[168:42.69]So that would be... Hold on.
[168:45.22]That would be 1.3 million.
[168:47.40]No deal.
[168:48.14]Get out of here.
[168:49.64]Million still on the table.
[168:51.30]If the million's still on the table, you don't take that.
[168:55.70]Three.
[168:58.34]Good.
[168:58.99]Very good.
[168:59.55]Very good.
[168:59.97]We still have all the big numbers left.
[169:01.27]That's awesome.
[169:03.01]Four.
[169:05.55]Ten bucks.
[169:06.07]Get out of here.
[169:09.97]Nine.
[169:12.17]It goes one cent.
[169:14.23]That's two million dollars.
[169:15.55]I wonder if I should take it.
[169:17.43]No deal.
[169:18.29]I'm going to have a fucking million dollars in this case.
[169:20.35]No.
[169:26.88]Okay.
[169:27.42]Alright.
[169:27.78]This is big.
[169:28.50]This is a big deal.
[169:35.80]This is a big deal.
[169:37.70]No deal.
[169:41.26]Look at the stats on this one.
[169:43.31]Look at the stats on this.
[169:44.17]I got this in the bag.
[169:49.97]Holy shit.
[169:51.99]No deal.
[169:53.59]No deal.

[170:17.77]24.
[170:17.85]Get rid of it.
[170:18.45]Why would I take the deal?
[170:20.03]No deal.
[170:20.27]Let's go.
[170:20.55]I'm keeping my original case.
[170:44.88]It's alright.
[170:45.20]That's a lot.
[170:46.22]That's a lot.
[170:46.72]That's a lot.
[170:47.22]That's times 100.
[170:48.00]What's that?
[170:48.36]50 million?
[170:50.16]How much is that?
[170:54.25]That's 50 million off the debt.
[170:56.95]Just like that.
[171:04.75]Good, because I just put on an extra billion, so... What was it?
[171:09.50]500 million?
[171:09.78]Double or nothing?
[171:11.78]Nothing?
[171:13.81]What do you mean double or nothing?
[171:15.98]You mean like, you mean times 200.
[171:18.42]Or it all goes away.
[171:27.56]Yeah, I'll do that.
[171:28.18]We're gonna get a loud ad, loud.
[171:38.47]Double or nothing times 200.
[171:39.27]Or it's all wiped.
[171:40.29]This is it.
[171:41.11]Let's go.

[172:20.15]Let's go!
[172:31.81]Pretty good start.
[172:33.67]Right up the bat.
[172:37.67]Oh, I have to get rid of these.
[172:40.19]Kill all these tiny numbers.
[172:45.31]We said no deal.
[172:46.35]What are you talking about?
[172:47.05]No, you didn't.
[172:49.89]We didn't mean no deal.
[172:52.69]Wait, what?
[172:55.41]This is a deal.
[172:56.93]This is deal.
[173:01.27]No, this is deal.
[173:02.21]This is deal.
[173:02.77]This is deal.
[173:07.23]One guy.
[173:07.81]I got one.
[173:08.53]Oh, one guy is just trying to mess it all up.
[173:10.49]I see.
[173:11.41]Okay.
[173:13.37]We continue.
[173:18.77]I'm not even gonna look.
[173:26.69]Straw poll?
[173:27.19]What do you mean straw poll?
[173:30.01]Poll for the double or nothing.
[173:33.65]No, no.
[173:34.59]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[173:36.67]This is not 500 million.
[173:39.71]No poll.
[173:40.61]We don't need to do that.
[173:44.65]Nine.
[173:44.83]400 gone.
[173:49.20]What is double or nothing?
[173:50.18]If you don't know what double or nothing is, well, it's when you say, I want to double everything that just happened or I lose everything.
[173:59.11]Excellent.
[173:59.91]Go ahead, get rid of this entire column.
[174:05.72]Oh, deal or no deal?
[174:08.48]No deal.
[174:09.22]Oh, very brave.
[174:10.68]Time for the next round.
[174:13.17]What is the nothing in this case?
[174:14.39]Losing the 50 million that I just shaved off.
[174:16.71]Because I just won.
[174:18.51]I just got 50 million shaved off the debt.
[174:21.15]I doubled the nothing, which says this is the one.
[174:23.00]It's times 200, so it's times 100.
[174:30.50]Good.
[174:34.42]Keep a million.
[174:35.99]Oh, fuck you.
[174:42.15]How do you lose, though?
[174:43.89]Well, I lose by getting any of these.
[174:46.87]Because that would be so much less.
[174:50.99]So it's times 200 of whatever this game is.
[174:53.27]Alright.
[175:01.96]Anything lower than your previous number.
[175:03.66]What?
[175:04.00]No!
[175:10.06]No, that's like impossible, isn't it?
[175:18.04]No deal.

[175:45.03]Okay.
[175:45.63]No deal.
[175:46.31]No deal.
[175:46.75]No deal.
[175:47.49]Very bad odds.
[175:49.25]Very bad odds.
[175:59.17]Get rid of the things around my case.
[176:03.17]This is like Minesweeper.
[176:04.21]Get all these things away from my number.
[176:07.33]They're bad.
[176:08.05]No deal.
[176:10.25]No deal.
[176:19.04]Fuck.

[176:26.96]There is a one, two, three, four, five, six.
[176:30.24]There's a... I gotta get rid of another one of these.
[176:32.08]If I get rid of one or two more of these, that's a 50-50 shot to get something good.
[176:38.56]Oh, fuck you.
[176:39.63]The million's still there.
[176:41.07]The million's still there.
[176:43.21]Still there.
[176:44.41]No deal.
[176:45.19]That's the spirit.
[176:46.19]Time for the next round.
[176:51.23]nice one okay no deal one in four chance that it's a million which is 200 million off the debt oh deal or no deal oh very brave time for the next round
[177:19.48]I took the deal for 700... What is it?
[177:21.62]$1400?
[177:27.39]With 10 bucks in the fucking case.
[177:28.23]$1400 taken off the debt.
[177:28.91]It would have been 50 million.
[177:55.04]Stop.
[178:00.31]What do you mean triple or nothing?
[178:01.45]I just got nothing.
[178:04.39]Triple or nothing?
[178:07.07]How do I get... How do I see anything bad from that?
[178:12.14]I went down to $1,400.
[178:12.56]Triple or nothing, but double the debt if you lose.
[178:21.71]Oh!
[178:36.70]But what is losing?
[178:39.02]What's losing in this case?
[178:44.58]What do you mean, if you lose?
[178:47.02]Anything less than what?
[178:54.47]If something on the left side is picked, it's a lose, okay?
[178:58.49]Anything on the left side?
[179:00.11]This is bad.
[179:13.20]I'm in.
[179:18.15]I'm in.
[179:18.73]300 times, whatever it shows, if I do not, if I get something on the left side, the debt is doubled from what it is right now.
[179:39.59]If I double this debt, I'm leaking a picture of my ass.
[179:42.25]That'll shave at least five billion off.
[179:51.59]Number four.
[179:56.45]No, it's shit on the left side, not this side.
[180:00.05]Fifteen.

[180:42.59]That's the spirit.
[180:43.59]Time for the next round.
[180:44.93]Doesn't count.
[180:45.65]Okay, I have to see it through.
[180:47.11]Nice one.

[181:03.01]It's not a nice one, dude.
[181:05.47]Nice one.

[181:42.25]I'm ruined, but I still, I could, 200,000 could be in that case.
[181:53.53]Oh, very brave.
[181:54.99]Time for the next round.
[181:56.40]Nice one.
[181:58.58]I have faith in what I've decided to do today.
[182:04.69]Nice one.

[182:45.32]Let's get rid of the evil number.
[182:46.20]Deal or no deal?
[182:58.55]No deal.
[182:59.33]That's the spirit.
[183:00.33]Time for the next round.
[183:28.01]All that.
[183:29.33]I could have just said no.
[183:31.61]And nothing would have happened.
[183:32.95]And it would have been fine.
[183:34.92]I could have just said no.
[183:41.70]I had a 50 million dollar win.
[183:43.98]And then it's over.
[183:45.46]I just doubled it.
[183:51.41]Oh no.
[183:53.79]Oh no.
[183:54.45]Oh well.
[183:59.21]Oh well.
[184:04.91]Yeah, I'll find a way.

[184:18.76]So does everybody that sits at the fucking roulette wheel, by the way.
[184:26.91]I can't believe I just doubled it.
[184:28.65]Now I'm hungry.
[184:29.56]That just made me hungry.
[184:31.98]I'm gonna eat a bunch of food later.
[184:36.18]I'm gonna eat so much food later, you have no idea.
[184:46.66]Alright, this room is done.
[184:47.64]That's the camera.
[184:50.14]That's the shotgun staring contest.
[184:52.04]Whoever blinks, if somebody blinks, you die.
[185:02.67]Stop ignoring the ass pic.
[185:04.86]Look, I'm holding the ass pic in my pocket.
[185:08.14]Because if it comes down to it, and that's like a two and a half, three billion shave off the debt.
[185:14.52]I mean, like, come on.
[185:17.47]Really?
[185:19.55]I'll take it.
[185:25.03]Do it now.

[187:04.68]So, I guess nothing can be worse than that.
[187:07.42]So, you'll... I mean, I don't think anything will make you upset.

[187:40.16]That's weird.
[187:43.04]Why is it like that?
[187:45.16]He left?
[187:45.72]Oh.
[187:46.80]Sorry.

[187:49.51]Alright, mouse, keyboard.

[188:06.67]It's an RGB keyboard.
[188:21.58]He's got a bunch of different connections here.
[188:23.69]Tons of hotkeys.
[188:26.95]A bunch of macros.

[189:24.57]Okay, what did he rode?
[189:25.41]He rode, like, one of these.
[189:26.11]He's like, I'm ready to get on my bike and do that.
[189:35.05]He just rides down the hall and rides by, opens their door and, like, rides by.
[189:39.59]Alright, that works.
[189:45.08]Hey, there's the bike.
[189:45.70]I need a chair.
[189:46.33]Alright.
[189:57.92]He needs a mouse.
[190:13.26]Okay, cool.
[190:15.94]That looks good.
[190:19.94]Very bad deal.
[190:23.56]Here's a homeless challenge.
[190:24.64]If Jerma posts on Twitter, I have a big dumpy and doesn't delete it, then all offers made today are off the table.
[190:30.00]If not, they stay and an extra $100 are added.
[190:32.58]Wait, if I tweet right now, I have a big dumpy.
[190:34.66]How much does that remove?
[190:37.98]I haven't tweeted in four months.
[190:51.35]I have not tweeted in four months and I'm going to write, I have a big dumpy.
[190:56.45]But I can't say anything about it.
[190:59.85]And I say I was put up to it by chat.
[191:01.41]They put me up to it.
[191:03.33]But I can't ever speak of it again.
[191:10.11]So like I have to write, I have a big dumpy.
[191:13.37]And if I bring up the fact that I was put on to do that, the deal gets pulled away.
[191:20.95]Like, I have to act like I wanted to write that.
[191:25.71]If I say, well, because chat made me, and I tweet later or like in another stream or something.
[191:35.87]No, no, no deal.
[191:37.17]Nope.
[191:38.01]No deal.
[191:40.49]No, that means I have to tweet, which I, that's not going to happen.
[191:46.94]Oops.
[191:51.99]I gotta fix this.
[191:55.12]Okay, so this is the fold the t-shirt room.
[192:01.22]Like a suit or like shirts?
[192:09.82]This room can stay like this.
[192:11.36]Is the gas right?
[192:12.04]Okay.
[192:18.06]I don't even care.
[192:18.56]They can stay.
[192:21.62]Clean up the bugs.
[192:22.76]No, there has to be like bugs and weird shit in here.
[192:33.83]No, it came all too far.
[192:35.17]No, no, no, no, no.
[192:54.14]What?
[192:57.38]What?
[193:02.26]What?
[193:02.42]What?
[193:04.72]There's no room.
[193:05.36]What are you talking about?
[193:06.60]Yes, there is.
[193:14.72]Well, the door's going there then.
[193:16.13]Fuck it.
[193:27.82]Where's the scary door?
[193:32.87]What?
[193:33.41]I said shelter.
[193:39.07]Why does this... Oh, fuck you.
[193:54.84]Why?
[194:02.86]Jerma punching.
[194:03.86]Punch this door.
[194:04.72]Punch it.
[194:05.12]There we go.
[194:13.93]Ah!
[194:15.03]I can fix it.
[194:15.47]I'll make a little chat.
[194:29.76]You and me laugh sometimes.
[194:31.32]Yeah, sometimes.
[194:41.14]Good.
[194:42.72]Well, yeah.
[194:44.22]Well, yeah.
[194:45.08]Yeah.
[194:45.46]Wait.
[194:46.54]Hold on.
[194:46.80]Move this.
[194:51.82]This is like you have to sneak in and sneak through the chicken wire.
[194:55.44]Okay.
[195:07.93]Okay.
[195:10.83]They're electric.
[195:13.07]Yeah, this is like, I don't know, there's like Apple over here or something.
[195:18.46]These are all bad deals.
[195:19.36]No, no more deals.
[195:20.00]I'm not making any more deals today.
[195:22.48]No more deals.
[195:23.48]All deals are done.
[195:26.52]I've made enough mistakes this afternoon.
[195:28.60]No more.
[195:29.26]No more deals.
[195:30.02]They're done.
[195:30.72]They're over.
[195:40.08]No more deals.
[195:41.76]No more deals.
[195:42.36]It's over.
[195:43.70]I'm not making it.
[195:44.40]No.
[195:45.20]No.
[195:46.16]No more deals.
[195:46.81]They're done.
[195:55.45]I want the door to open here.
[196:00.53]Right there.
[196:01.39]Okay.
[196:02.49]Oh, bats.
[196:03.65]I don't want anyone peeking on anybody else's torture.
[196:08.47]Hey, what's going on in your room?
[196:09.97]I have to fold laundry or else I get gassed.
[196:14.55]Oh, dude, I gotta make it through this, like, razor wire or I get gassed.
[196:17.25]Is there any food in there?
[196:23.52]Hey, hey, hey, no talking to each other.
[196:37.73]No doing my puzzles with each other.
[196:39.74]That's not fair.
[196:53.44]I can see you.
[197:00.28]No notes in the classroom.
[197:05.15]No taking notes.
[197:08.60]Alright, these rooms are getting close to being ready.
[197:14.30]Fake laugh.
[197:18.40]Good.
[197:20.58]The walls need to be kind of all messed up, though.
[197:22.71]I don't know, something... Wood.
[197:31.17]Yeah, like wood panels.
[197:41.48]Okay, let's go.
[197:48.66]Can you buy dirt?
[197:49.90]Um, I don't... Maybe you can.
[197:52.52]I don't think so.
[197:53.18]I'm gonna read this.
[197:57.96]Sneed.
[197:58.44]Haha.
[198:03.11]Okay, whatever.
[198:03.65]I don't know what that is.
[198:10.94]They did add the garden flipper thing, right?
[198:14.96]Maybe I can do dirt or grass.
[198:17.12]I need more panels.
[198:30.57]Holy shit.
[198:31.43]You go through these quick.
[198:40.54]Play Left 4 Dead with the Biav Boomer mod.
[198:44.61]Or Dead.
[198:45.61]No, you guys are going to have to come to a decision sometimes.
[198:53.25]You can't just yell out deals that aren't going to happen.
[198:56.51]Just alone.
[198:57.03]You guys have to come up with a solution for that.
[198:58.74]You have to come up with... You have to agree.
[199:06.00]Bathroom tile.
[199:06.82]Let's see if I can put grass in here.
[199:22.97]Make it a Google Doc.
[199:24.01]I can't even get over there.
[199:30.86]Move.
[199:31.16]Okay.
[199:31.32]Can I make a new bet?
[199:51.99]In the new Saw not Saw movie spiral, within the last 30 minutes of the movie, will... play?
[200:11.51]I think it will.
[200:13.93]Of course it will.
[200:14.67]You think so?
[200:17.55]It might not.
[200:18.51]It's not a Saw movie.
[200:31.87]Only suffering pays for the debt now, fool.
[200:37.72]Okay, anime villain.
[200:39.16]Alright, that looks fine.
[200:44.38]I need fluorescence.
[200:51.96]I need green fluorescent lights.
[200:54.68]All those movies are green.
[201:00.07]I love that weird green fluorescent look.
[201:05.56]Okay, what would it be?
[201:06.22]Lamps.
[201:07.80]Ceiling lamps.
[201:08.42]Lamps.
[201:21.08]Hold on, I gotta put this in one of the rooms.
[201:24.32]Okay, good vibes.
[201:36.90]This is the waiting room.
[201:44.98]This is the don't blink shotgun challenge.
[201:49.45]Whatever this is.
[201:52.12]Okay, over here is the... What is, what is, what is this?
[201:57.60]I don't know, I haven't decided yet.
[202:01.26]Oh, the puke challenge, right.
[202:02.18]Is there a garage with a bunch of, like, trash in it?
[202:08.96]Holy shit, there's a ton of moles.
[202:10.82]Whatever, leave them.
[202:14.35]Just make it a closet.
[202:15.17]Where do you put your car?
[202:24.99]There's no garage.
[202:25.63]There's no driveway.
[202:45.24]This is stupid.
[202:46.00]Remember things, everyone can afford a car.
[202:51.55]No, I didn't say that.
[202:52.55]I just said that there's no driveway and there's no garage.
[202:56.37]This is a house.
[202:58.23]I don't know very many houses that don't have a driveway or a garage, at least.
[203:01.67]Or some kind of, like, driveway, at least.
[203:03.47]What, do you just park your car on the street?
[203:11.59]I... Yes?
[203:13.81]Nobody has a driveway?
[203:17.05]You millionaire.
[203:17.99]What are you talking about?
[203:19.25]No!
[203:20.99]What?
[203:22.39]A lot of houses don't have a driveway or a garage.
[203:32.79]Not an EU, you monster!
[203:35.67]I live in NA!
[203:39.17]Actual billionaire.
[203:45.75]What?
[203:46.45]It's not- You don't determine who is a billionaire by who has a driveway!
[203:58.64]I like this room, so I like this room.
[204:00.06]I could use a little decoration.
[204:05.30]You have a helicopter pad, too?
[204:07.53]A driveway is not even close.
[204:10.65]It's not even close to a helicopter pad.
[204:20.30]I need this to be scary.
[204:25.15]Oh, this is my room, right.
[204:26.86]Okay, this can be fine.
[204:28.02]I like this the way it is.
[204:29.90]This looks good.
[204:30.38]Alright, so then I gotta do some paint.
[204:37.99]Uh, black.
[204:40.43]Just black paint.
[204:54.50]You have a helicopter pad, you can't even pay your debt.
[204:57.74]I don't have a helicopter pad.
[204:59.24]I'm- I don't- I don't- No, I don't have any of these things.
[205:09.85]Helicopter pad.
[205:14.69]No, if I had the money for a helicopter pad...
[205:18.45]This is why you guys are bullshitting yourselves.
[205:21.37]If I had the money to have a helicopter pad, Danny DeVito would have been on the stream already.
[205:26.79]Do you understand that?
[205:27.37]I don't know how that's so hard to believe.
[205:28.91]I would have used that money to pay for a full Danny DeVito pretends to be me streaming as me, but it's not me.
[205:38.58]It's him.
[205:38.90]It's Danny DeVito, but he's still saying my lines and stuff.
[205:51.44]I've got my lines here.
[205:52.54]Alright, this is looking a little more saw-like.
[205:56.44]I've got to put weird lamps and stuff in here too.
[206:16.24]Jerma, why are you painting the house black?
[206:17.84]Isn't it going to be really hot in here?
[206:22.46]I'm fucking torturing people in here, mate.
[206:36.48]I'm killing people in here.
[206:38.97]Do I care about how hot it is in the house?
[206:47.29]Why'd you just say mate?
[206:49.19]I didn't.
[206:54.70]I forgot about the good vibes with the gas machine above it.
[206:58.08]Oh, sorry, the machine.
[206:59.50]It really is so dark in here, though.
[207:17.71]I'm going to need some lights.
[207:28.21]He's talking through the spirit box.
[207:45.38]Don't put in any lights.
[207:46.32]Force them to bump into the walls.
[207:50.50]No, I wouldn't be able to even see what I'm doing.
[207:51.94]Is it going to be lamps?
[207:59.33]Stream Phasmophobia VR for 300 million.
[208:03.63]Hmm.
[208:05.17]That means I have to get back in VR, which I can't really do right now.
[208:08.30]No deal.
[208:12.86]No deal.
[208:13.42]Sorry.
[208:14.00]No deal.
[208:25.48]Play some music for a million off.
[208:26.88]I know that's fake.
[208:29.96]That's fake.
[208:31.77]This is starting to come together.
[208:33.09]I gotta close this.
[208:46.24]What is happening here, though?
[208:49.56]What's the chair for?
[208:50.38]What is this?
[208:51.26]I mean, obviously there's something in here.
[208:52.50]There's a fluid in here that if you breathe in, it's gonna hurt, but what happens in here?
[208:57.31]We have a theme on every room.
[208:59.66]This is the wire room.
[209:00.48]You have to sneak in and get in there before you die.
[209:02.80]This is the... Fold- the amount of t-shirts you can fold in like 10 minutes.
[209:08.03]If you don't fold 20, then you- the gas kills you.
[209:10.27]If you don't make it through the, uh, razor wire, the gas kills you.
[209:16.20]So what hap- what happens in here?
[209:27.44]Gasp.
[209:28.10]No, but I mean, but how?
[209:30.00]What's the chair for?
[209:37.61]Hold on.
[209:40.19]Beat my high score in pinball?
[209:42.01]Where you get gassed?
[209:46.67]Cook me a perfect Thanksgiving turkey.
[209:50.88]Where you get gassed.
[209:54.12]Uh...
[210:01.36]Yeah, that works.
[210:09.01]Put a bunch of food items in here.
[210:29.28]Replay the what song?
[210:31.96]I need a counter.
[210:36.26]One of these has to be a pool-related one.
[210:38.82]Hold on, there's got to be a pool room.
[210:42.46]Which one of these can be the swim challenge?
[210:49.78]Hold on.
[210:50.36]Get rid of the bugs.
[211:01.84]Dive into the pool of needles.
[211:07.92]That's so stupid.
[211:08.80]This is a Halloween party with a saw theme?
[211:23.41]Well, not quite.
[211:24.97]Considering it'd have to be jello shots in every one of these rooms.
[211:39.80]even likes jello shots they're disgusting who's the first person that thought that was cool to do that nope who eats them and thinks they're good they're terrible
[211:52.95]And they're always made by somebody that, you know, oh, I made Jell-O shots.
[211:56.65]And it's just like pure, just straight fucking vodka.
[211:59.37]It doesn't even taste like anything.
[212:01.11]It's just like, ugh.
[212:03.31]You just put like ground up Jell-O in like gelatin with like vodka.
[212:08.68]You made this wrong.
[212:09.80]You made it wrong.
[212:12.00]It's gross.
[212:12.86]And it's just jelly vodka.
[212:14.72]Oh, it's disgusting.
[212:15.62]It's horrible.
[212:16.06]I don't think I've ever had a Jell-O shot in my life that I didn't want to immediately spit out into like the toilet.
[212:25.44]And the jello, they're always not ready yet.
[212:30.42]What's up with that?
[212:33.76]You go to a Halloween party, and they're not quite fucking ready yet.
[212:36.92]Like, they're just barely being taken out of the fridge.
[212:40.09]And they're not ready.
[212:42.19]And they're still in the jello tray.
[212:46.79]So, oh, I gotta dig my finger in there and pull one out, and it's bleeding over the top of the tray.
[212:52.29]Okay.
[212:54.65]Uh, thanks, I guess, and it's kind of already melting in my hand.
[212:59.15]Oh, this is horrible.
[212:59.91]This is gross.
[213:00.67]Oh, cool, jello shot.
[213:01.77]Thanks, dude.
[213:05.57]Airplane food bit.
[213:06.57]Let me get the microphone and stand up for a second.
[213:10.86]Halloween's a fun time.
[213:12.44]But, I mean, come on.
[213:13.94]What's going on with those jello shots, dude?
[213:16.24]I know this guy knows back here.
[213:17.64]This guy, yeah, the guy that just screamed.
[213:19.32]You would like those.
[213:22.92]I got something to tell you, man.
[213:24.52]Sit down for this one.
[213:26.80]I have to do the stand-up comedy open mic night stream.
[213:30.18]It's gonna be so embarrassing and so horrible, but I have to do it.
[213:34.97]I have to get permission to go to, like, a comedy club.
[213:39.57]And I don't have, like, any material.
[213:41.59]I'm gonna come up with some shitty material and go to an open mic night, get permission to stream there, and just do a set.
[213:51.25]And see what happens.
[213:54.41]I'm gonna be in like a full suit with like slicked back hair.
[213:59.82]I wanna have such slicked back hair that like the slicked oil is like kind of going down the sides of my face.
[214:13.57]The Joker.
[214:14.51]No, no.
[214:15.03]This would be different.
[214:15.83]This would be different.
[214:18.99]That would wipe the debt.
[214:20.69]Oh, that's easy.
[214:22.75]Alright, so now I need a table.
[214:28.83]I need, like, countertop.
[214:30.01]Let's go to kitchen.
[214:33.46]Here we go.
[214:33.70]There you go.
[214:43.14]Here's your food preparation area.
[214:47.92]He said he would do it for free.
[214:49.22]I did say I would do it for free.
[214:54.00]Is there a turkey?
[214:59.86]No, there's no turkey.
[215:01.46]There's food items though, isn't there?
[215:09.41]What about a microwave?
[215:12.61]Supplies.
[215:13.07]Oh, here you go.
[215:14.05]Like tomatoes, canned meat.
[215:17.13]There.
[215:19.79]Gonna make a Thanksgiving dinner with what's on the table.
[215:21.81]And if he doesn't like it, then you get chopped.
[215:24.98]But getting chopped means you get gassed.
[215:28.76]And there's no other contestants.
[215:30.36]There's you and the judge.
[215:42.75]Oh, we should make a Thanksgiving dinner with... Who puts tomato paste on your turkey?
[215:46.86]Whatever.
[215:49.48]Okay, here we go.
[215:50.30]That looks good.
[215:50.82]Now we need a... Like an AC unit.
[216:00.79]Oh, I need a... Hold on.
[216:01.89]I need an installation.
[216:02.67]Oh, there's just been shotguns all over the place.
[216:19.95]Oh, shit!
[216:20.57]Gas!
[216:26.20]Air gun?
[216:41.11]Screw that in.
[216:41.89]Screw this in.
[216:50.25]Happy birthday to the guy in chat.
[216:51.91]Hey, happy birthday to the one guy in chat.
[216:54.39]Hope you have a good one.
[216:56.99]Birthday before Thanksgiving?
[216:59.37]Double.
[217:02.49]Play Among Us?
[217:03.96]Let's go.
[217:05.66]Let's go.
[217:09.62]Let's go.
[217:09.98]Alright, let's seal this up.
[217:20.39]We need a table.
[217:22.21]Just a little table.
[217:23.83]So you have some room to work.
[217:30.79]It's a coffee table, but whatever.
[217:32.65]You can bend over.
[217:34.51]Seal it up.
[217:47.39]Reinforced door?
[217:49.47]Door?
[217:50.01]Will that get DMCA'd?
[217:53.57]I don't know, probably.
[217:54.99]I don't know.
[217:56.79]Probably.
[218:27.45]What does DMCA stand for?
[218:28.59]Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
[218:52.30]Cringe.
[218:52.82]Oh, cringe.
[218:53.44]Millennial.
[218:54.16]Millennial.
[218:58.10]Fringe Millennial.
[219:01.80]This is the only normal door, and it's my battle station for Jigsaw.
[219:07.16]Okay, we get- our trap rooms are looking pretty good.
[219:11.91]So far.
[219:13.91]This has got- this is just a closet.
[219:15.97]Oh, there, the puke bathroom.
[219:22.11]What are some of the gross things that would be in here that would smell?
[219:36.28]Okay, we're gonna have an old- an old jar of soup.
[219:42.56]Oh, a large food container that's just open with like rotting food in it.
[219:56.73]Okay.
[220:02.93]Jar of soup.
[220:06.24]Okay, what about... The nuts?
[220:11.30]No.
[220:12.22]Food.
[220:13.98]Tuna fish?
[220:15.04]Opened, just canned tuna?
[220:16.76]Okay.
[220:29.61]Gasoline?
[220:36.01]No.
[220:36.23]Alright, how about we just go back to food.
[220:41.49]Just stick pickles, like old pickles.
[220:50.90]Bugs everywhere.
[220:57.13]You know what?
[220:57.43]It smells good.
[220:57.77]I don't know what you're talking about.
[221:14.45]No, forget that.
[221:18.88]Another AC installation right here.
[221:36.84]Okay, if one of these turned on, wouldn't he be gassing himself in his own house?
[221:41.25]You can't really turn this shit off.
[221:48.68]You twist the valve a few times, but you have to leave the house too.
[221:52.26]You gotta get out.
[221:54.76]If one person fails their challenge, everybody's dead.
[222:08.91]Somebody instantly fails the challenge.
[222:11.55]The razor wire guy just runs in and just...
[222:17.76]Everybody just didn't even get to listen to their tapes yet.
[222:20.20]Alright, we need this to be dangerous looking.
[222:29.89]I need... What do I need?
[222:33.76]Oh, wood paneling.
[222:34.52]Wood paneling is scary, isn't it?
[222:47.55]Why does this feel like a Halloween stream?
[222:52.52]It's not, but it is.
[222:54.22]Kind of.
[223:03.48]Put in mirrors everywhere?
[223:04.63]No.
[223:12.05]Thanksgiving saw trap.
[223:14.93]Well, that's technically themed a little bit.
[223:18.81]Alright, this is the smell room, so... Hello again, David.
[223:26.32]You can't puke into here.
[223:29.68]Or, you know what happens.
[223:34.47]Put carpet all over the floor?
[223:35.57]Yeah, sure.
[223:45.82]Carpeted bathroom?
[223:47.50]He already pukes.
[223:48.94]Didn't even need to smell anything.
[223:59.11]That's disgusting.
[224:02.47]His door has to change.
[224:14.86]This is just next to a normal closet.
[224:18.60]No, this has to be something.
[224:20.16]I mean maybe it is just a closet.
[224:32.10]Make it a snack bar.
[224:37.12]It's just a little walk-in closet.
[224:42.38]This has to close.
[224:48.63]Just put a skeleton in there.
[224:49.73]Go to decorations.
[225:00.82]Need one of these.
[225:01.34]Fucking go in here.
[225:19.17]Wait, there needs to be a speaker in every room so they can be communicated with.
[225:31.84]Yeah, there needs to be a TV.
[225:32.68]Yes.
[225:32.76]Perfect.
[225:50.26]It needs to be a, like, a counter or something.
[225:56.00]A shelf or... Uh, no.
[226:04.59]What, what, what?
[226:05.17]It needs something to hold this.
[226:08.21]Like a TV stand.
[226:09.85]TV stand.
[226:11.85]This is massive.
[226:15.49]Just stack the TVs.
[226:16.71]Like, oh, hold on.
[226:17.55]That's not a bad idea.
[226:22.75]Oh, you can't.
[226:23.66]You can't.
[226:31.66]Nightstand?
[226:32.26]There's no such thing as a nightstand in this game?
[226:39.52]What?
[226:42.84]Furniture.
[226:43.24]I mean, this is small.
[226:57.11]Yeah, that's fine.
[227:18.15]But this guy's gonna be able to hear this guy's TV.
[227:30.56]How is this guy even going to be able to hear his TV?
[227:41.22]Where can I even put this?
[227:43.43]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[227:43.97]There we go.
[227:52.83]Alright, nice.
[227:56.94]Oh, shit!
[228:06.17]Okay, looking good.
[228:08.13]This one needs a TV too.
[228:09.19]There we go.
[228:11.89]Perfect spot for it right here.
[228:29.90]Saw three.
[228:33.20]Everybody has their own individual room.
[228:39.09]Oh, right.
[228:39.37]I forgot you had to make the dinner.
[228:40.45]Okay, here.
[228:40.87]Let's put one in here.
[228:41.94]This room has to look a little more evil.
[228:47.54]It's not evil enough.
[229:01.13]Yeah, not evil enough.
[229:01.97]It needs to look a little more evil.
[229:08.72]Beatbox the Bartman through the Saw Filter.
[229:12.71]Um, okay, I guess.
[229:19.77]Do the Bartman!
[229:21.26]Do the Bartman!
[229:24.56]Do the Bartman!
[229:31.16]I don't know why.
[229:32.02]I guess you made me do that.
[229:33.42]I did it.
[229:34.34]Thanks for the sub.
[229:36.46]Or thanks for following.
[229:38.74]Thanks for hanging out on this chat.
[229:39.72]Bye.
[229:39.90]This has been on the whole time.
[229:49.57]Here's the entrance.
[229:51.41]Where's the waiting room?
[229:52.19]Wait, the waiting room is far away from... You just hear people screaming in these rooms.
[229:57.05]Where's the waiting room?
[230:01.76]Oh, it's right here.
[230:02.48]Okay.
[230:02.74]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[230:03.22]Alright, so I can... I'm gonna go like this.
[230:07.20]Wait, there's this torture room right here.
[230:08.52]This is the kitchen torture.
[230:13.39]So this is the front door.
[230:14.21]You come in.
[230:15.51]Here we are.
[230:16.23]Somebody being tortured in there.
[230:18.21]There's your waiting room.
[230:20.01]The waiting... But I gotta block this off.
[230:27.55]Somebody... Which one is this one?
[230:32.77]Right, I bring them from the waiting room to their designated areas.
[230:36.69]This is fine.
[230:37.19]Yeah, I just need to... The walls need to be painted.
[230:45.19]Isn't there paint on the ground?
[230:48.65]Yeah.
[230:51.77]Why does he sound high?
[230:52.82]I don't think I do.
[231:01.02]I would tell you guys if I was.
[231:03.36]I'm not.
[231:07.44]No, I've learned my lesson.
[231:12.47]Look, if I'm gonna do, like, CBD or something before a stream, I gotta be very careful about the amount that I take.
[231:20.19]Because otherwise I can't read an analog clock and that's clipped forever.
[231:26.97]Since that happened...
[231:29.10]I have been super self-conscious about if I'm going to take that any CBD or anything before stream because of that Alright, this looks alright Waiting room So he has to walk from here So when somebody's like dies or whatever, it's like okay that one's done
[232:00.19]Okay, Tim, come with me.
[232:02.21]Hi, Tim.
[232:05.01]Yeah, we're going to be over in this door here.
[232:06.45]And go ahead.
[232:08.13]Hello again, Tim.
[232:14.29]Hello again, Tim.
[232:23.25]He's just sprinting around the house.
[232:29.71]Alright, I like it.
[232:30.83]So now I have to just do a little bit of clean up.
[232:32.34]We have to make some rooms a little better than others.
[232:35.80]Decorate the entrance way.
[232:39.38]Clean this up.
[232:45.95]I forgot about that.
[232:48.45]There needs to be a TV in here.
[232:51.61]Imagine the realtor trying to sell this.
[232:53.21]Oh, that's right.
[232:54.72]We're going to get a before and after too.
[233:08.53]God.
[233:08.87]Come on, I can't put this anywhere.
[233:16.15]Move the tuna cans.
[233:23.21]And the jar of pickles or whatever the hell this is.
[233:29.87]Key bottles?
[233:31.79]Are he pissed in the bottles?
[233:32.86]Shit, I gotta move these.
[233:37.73]Sorry, we have to remove some smelly things.
[233:39.65]Otherwise, I can't put a TV in here.
[233:55.15]Where's the camera?
[233:56.13]Oh, I need a webcam.
[234:08.26]He wants to get a really good view of him puking, too.
[234:32.71]By the way, Tim, if you think of using that toilet for anything besides throw-up,
[234:38.02]The gas turns on regardless.
[234:40.26]Any liquid that goes in will activate the trigger at the bottom of the toilet.
[234:45.90]Don't you dare pee in there.
[234:47.92]Plus, it's not connected to any real plumbing.
[234:51.18]So I'd have a real problem in my hands if you would shit in there or pee in there.
[234:54.94]Don't do it.
[234:55.60]That's a choice that I'm telling you not to make.
[234:57.72]Only if you can there.
[235:07.94]Turn the TV's on.
[235:08.68]No.
[235:20.37]Okay.
[235:20.81]Are we almost at the conclusion of the saw house?
[235:35.15]I can't believe it.
[235:36.12]Yeah, it's pretty much done.
[235:37.50]Wait, I gotta paint this room.
[235:42.82]I'm gonna do something like teal or something.
[235:53.82]Sky blue.
[236:09.88]Do nuclear green.
[236:17.55]No.
[236:23.94]The good vibes in the... Yeah, that's a good idea.
[236:26.10]I'll put the good vibes in the waiting room.
[236:43.54]This is actually creepier because it's like this.
[236:46.27]I didn't clean this window.
[236:47.27]What?
[236:48.03]How?
[237:00.47]Yeah.
[237:01.11]Good vibes is going into the other room.
[237:07.93]Nope, that's his room.
[237:08.81]Over here.
[237:09.07]I keep forgetting where all these rooms are.
[237:13.65]Good vibes.
[237:20.17]Coffee maker?
[237:21.33]Arcade cabinet?
[237:22.36]Oh, you have to beat Pac-Man.
[237:24.20]You have three lives.
[237:37.71]Sewer grate everywhere?
[237:49.17]Where's good vibes?
[237:56.06]Where's good vibes?
[238:16.89]Gas lights.
[238:20.83]Pretty good.
[238:21.75]Pretty funny.
[238:22.89]Pretty funny what you just said.
[238:24.15]I need to change this door, too.
[238:26.43]No, actually, this is fine.
[238:35.50]Oh, yeah, I need the gas mask, like the pig mask, right?
[238:53.68]Does he have a clown mask?
[238:54.84]Kind of.
[238:55.14]Yeah, he's ready to put that on and then go into the other rooms.
[239:11.87]I didn't even realize what this said.
[239:16.29]Chill out in your man cave.
[239:24.74]Okay, looking good.
[239:32.34]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[239:39.64]No light in here.
[239:48.71]I want this to be...
[239:52.02]Hmm... There's gotta be like TVs everywhere, right?
[240:22.29]It always says zero o'clock in the man cave?
[240:25.49]What?
[240:41.24]It's always beer o'clock.
[240:42.74]Yeah, nice gift shop.
[240:48.43]Nice back wall of every gift shop in every hotel I've ever been in, by the way.
[241:02.14]Only two things I require.
[241:04.10]Beer and football.
[241:08.66]And it's a bottle opener.
[241:22.66]Alright, this is scary and horrifying and I'm 35 and think this is like cool.

[241:36.07]I need some scary paintings.
[241:44.51]Uh, I don't know.
[241:44.95]No, I don't know what that is.
[241:46.53]That's not scary.
[241:51.48]Hating a horse?
[241:52.38]Yeah, like a weird horse picture.
[241:56.29]It's not big enough.
[242:00.13]They put clown masks everywhere.
[242:01.71]I think that's overdoing it.
[242:03.43]That's overdoing it.
[242:05.17]Just a little.
[242:09.84]It's overdoing it.
[242:13.98]That's overdoing it, man.
[242:19.72]I hate when it does that.

[254:27.71]I gotta put a couch here, though, before it's ruined.

[254:44.03]I'm going to ruin it.
[255:04.58]Okay, now it's good.
[255:13.39]It's perfect.
[255:14.67]It's perfect.
[255:16.49]Now sell it.
[255:18.07]Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[255:19.07]Yeah, yeah, sell, sell, sell.
[255:21.11]Okay, how do I sell the house?
[255:26.11]Wait, yeah, first we have to do a tour.
[255:36.36]Come in the front door.
[255:37.84]Here we are.
[255:38.34]Ooh, already.
[255:39.54]What is this?
[255:40.74]A mirror for you to look at yourself.
[255:48.08]That's a photo of me.
[255:50.86]Or some, no, I mean it's a photo of some guy.
[255:53.10]I just find him very, very handsome and very smart.
[255:56.44]Incredibly talented.
[255:57.28]I don't know who that is.
[256:00.52]Please continue to make your choice by going through the door.
[256:03.47]Watch out for the TVs.
[256:07.59]On your left, you'll find the waiting room.
[256:09.79]Head inside of that waiting room.
[256:12.63]Here, you will find another picture of an incredibly handsome man.
[256:17.54]It's one of my philosophies in life.
[256:20.94]You will sit and you will wait until your deli number is called.
[256:26.68]No provolone, please.
[256:29.17]I'm kidding.
[256:31.05]Once your name is called, you will open the door.
[256:35.13]You will go to your designated room number.
[256:37.67]Let's say you're number four.
[256:39.23]You'll be in here.
[256:41.16]Terrible room.
[256:43.52]The eye contact room.
[256:46.00]You will sit down and look in the mirror the first to blink.
[256:48.72]Moses, the shotgun will blow your skullcap outside into the window.
[256:54.91]Outside the open window, by the way.
[256:57.47]That shit's gonna go all over the neighbor's house.
[257:00.21]Which, I, that's pretty, that's really disgusting and fucked up.
[257:04.41]That's what I do.
[257:05.27]That's what I do.
[257:05.91]I do disgusting, fucked up things.
[257:09.05]Leaving this room will bring you to the entryway for more torture and more testing.
[257:16.08]One of my favorite tests.
[257:17.65]It was used in four or five of the movies.
[257:21.09]Trying to get through the sharp object without dying of blood being removed from your body.
[257:30.13]The door will close.
[257:32.43]On your left there will be a still image from Saw II.
[257:36.51]Pretty good.
[257:38.21]This next room is terrible, disgusting, and dastardly.
[257:42.22]You have one minute in this room.
[257:45.19]to be able to fold ten t-shirts the way they do in that old navy.
[257:49.29]If you do not have perfect square shirts, gas will fill the room, killing you in under one minute.
[257:59.88]I'll try here.
[258:01.38]Just don't go in that room, don't go in that room, get out of that room.
[258:03.22]Get out of that, get out of that room.
[258:04.46]Get out of it, get out of it, don't go in there.
[258:07.39]That's a room you don't need to see.
[258:10.03]Going forward, you'll find the couch area.
[258:12.97]which will allow you to sit and watch my magnum opus, SAW III.
[258:19.61]Am I still in the movies?
[258:21.65]As of SAW VI, VII, VIII?
[258:24.12]No one knows.
[258:24.66]They still happen to keep using my acting ability, because I'm the only motherfucker in this entire series that anybody actually thought was interesting.
[258:33.50]So of course they gotta keep me in every single movie.
[258:36.51]I carry the entire franchise.
[258:43.95]That's just a closet.
[258:46.63]Nothing in there.
[258:49.68]In case you need to put something in there, if you do, put it in there.
[258:54.76]The final test.
[258:58.50]The final test.
[259:03.38]Is a very interesting one indeed.
[259:06.13]Because this is your test, Michael.
[259:09.07]This is your test.
[259:12.40]The same exile and the entire reason why I brought you here in the first place.
[259:16.48]The door has just locked behind you.
[259:18.34]You thought this was a tour.
[259:20.54]Your test begins now.
[259:22.76]I know how much you don't like smelly smells.
[259:25.88]I know how much you think it's disgusting.
[259:27.82]Beetles and bugs.
[259:29.90]You wouldn't touch them when you were a child.
[259:32.05]But now you must.
[259:33.91]Because if you cannot be in this room for more than one minute... Gas.
[259:38.87]The gas will stop flowing.
[259:41.34]Only after you puke, though.
[259:42.44]I gotta make that really clear.
[259:43.57]I've been talking for a while.
[259:44.99]Only after you puke.
[259:46.35]If you puke into that toilet, gas will fill the room.
[259:50.35]Gas will fill the room.
[259:55.47]Make your choice.
[259:56.88]Will you stand the smelly smells for ten minutes?
[260:00.80]No!
[260:01.04]No!
[260:01.20]I just wanted to play a game of House Flipper!
[260:04.38]What the fuck?!
[260:04.90]No, dude, no!
[260:05.48]Oh!
[260:30.29]Alright.
[261:08.85]Alright, let's sell the house now.
[261:11.82]That's like a thousand people probably just left.
[261:14.02]I was thinking about turning the stream off right there, but I want to sell the house.
[261:24.50]I need a light in here.
[261:27.56]Did like 3,000 people leave?
[261:30.58]I need some lamps so you can even see anything.
[261:35.10]I don't even give a shit what they are.
[261:36.22]Who cares if they're like golden?
[261:37.36]I don't care.
[261:38.02]These need to work.
[261:45.39]That's a ceiling lamp?
[261:47.11]Bitch.
[261:49.33]Okay, I was like, what?
[261:51.87]Ceiling lamp, bitch.
[261:52.97]I was like, what are you talking about?
[262:01.26]Seriously, I was like, that's one... Look it, two or three pixels off.
[262:10.81]Okay, hold on.
[262:11.73]I need to...
[262:15.66]Ceiling stars?
[262:26.48]Oh, this is stupid.
[262:27.54]Alright, hold on.
[262:28.16]I need to see a ceiling lamp.
[262:37.31]There.
[262:39.83]No, what?
[262:41.03]That's not a lamp.
[262:42.33]That is ceiling light.
[262:46.70]the hell is all this here we go I just need a couple so that we can even see what's going on there we go okay that's good right there and then that's good right there so you can see the movie that's fine who cares who cares okay who cares I'm ready let's sell the saw house you didn't show off the turkey room well look it must it must not have been interesting enough for him to even remember it existed
[263:15.98]He forgot.
[263:17.06]He's going to go in there tomorrow morning and he's going to make dinner.
[263:19.67]He's going to make breakfast and he's going to die.
[263:21.53]Because he's going to forget.
[263:35.95]Okay.
[263:36.71]Let's sell this.
[263:38.59]It's time to sell the... Sell it!
[263:44.01]Sell this house!
[263:55.73]I think there may be too many sofas.
[263:58.11]I need a bedroom, but there isn't one.
[264:01.29]No kitchen?
[264:01.83]Wonderful.
[264:02.25]We need a place for books.
[264:04.46]I need one and only one bedroom.
[264:05.48]Thanks to this huge amount of pictures, this house has its own character.
[264:08.54]There's a lovely living room in this house.
[264:12.96]There are too many rooms.
[264:14.30]There's no bathroom.
[264:15.78]There's no kitchen.
[264:16.86]There's no plants.
[264:17.52]Okay.
[264:21.10]There is no kitchen.
[264:22.40]There is no bathroom.
[264:28.83]This is the biggest scam ever.
[264:33.70]Alright, I accept your offer.
[264:35.90]Here we go.
[264:39.87]Wait, wait, wait!
[265:03.39]Who cares?
[265:06.05]Who cares?
[265:07.15]All you... What's wrong, Macho?
[265:09.67]You wanna go outside?
[265:10.33]Well, there it goes.
[265:17.99]I was sold.
[265:20.05]And, uh, game crashed.
[265:21.22]Oh, no, it didn't.
[265:30.32]Alright, let me, uh...
[265:32.95]You know, I think that's probably going to be it.
[265:35.83]I think I have to call it on this one.
[265:43.72]Why did you put George Carlin in the hallway?
[265:47.20]No, that was Saw.
[265:48.28]That was Tobin.
[265:52.28]Yeah, I got to go.
[265:53.00]Otto wants something.
[265:54.10]And I want to get up too.
[265:55.86]I want to stretch and eat something.
[265:58.33]I was hungry two hours ago.
[266:02.11]That was Tobin Saw.
[266:03.63]Yeah.
[266:06.57]That makes me want to go back and watch Saw 1 through 4.
[266:12.68]Doesn't it?
[266:13.40]Don't you just want to go watch Saw 1 again?
[266:20.36]No?
[266:20.78]What?
[266:23.03]Saw 1 is good.
[266:24.57]What's wrong with Saw 1?
[266:25.47]It was great.
[266:26.49]They just made 10 of them after that.
[266:29.87]You guys didn't like Saw 1?
[266:32.79]I thought it was alright.
[266:33.35]I thought it was fun.
[266:35.09]It was like, well, fun.
[266:36.35]Hold on.
[266:36.69]I thought it was a good movie.
[266:37.53]Not fun.
[266:40.11]I'm talking about it like it's The Secret Life of Pets or whatever it's called.
[266:49.46]Two was alright.
[266:56.34]I forget every single Saw movie after five.
[266:58.62]I've seen them all.
[267:01.63]They're all the same movie after five to my brain.
[267:04.63]Alright, I'll see you guys.
[267:07.19]You know, I probably, I'm probably not going to stream tomorrow.
[267:11.93]Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
[267:12.74]I've just completely forgot about it.
[267:16.86]We'll probably pick back up on Friday.
[267:18.06]We'll do probably Friday, Saturday.
[267:25.08]Because there's a couple, there's a few family oriented things I might want to do tomorrow afternoon.
[267:33.04]I need to do FaceTime family dinner with my parents.
[267:36.26]That's what I'm going to do.
[267:39.56]We'll see.
[267:41.44]If I'm here tomorrow, then I'm here.
[267:43.58]But plan on Friday, Saturday.
[267:53.42]Yeah, thanks for watching.
[267:55.16]Ending a little bit early today, but you know, it's alright.
[267:58.16]I think I got what I wanted out of the DLC.
[268:00.95]The next thing we're going to play, I'm going to play Sly Cooper as the next stream.
[268:05.10]So Sly Cooper won the PS3 remaster.
[268:07.10]Hopefully it's good.
[268:07.90]I'm looking forward to it.
[268:08.58]A lot of you guys have been trying to get me to play it, so we're going to play it.
[268:16.48]I will see you guys soon.
[268:18.62]Have a happy Thanksgiving if you're celebrating it tomorrow.
[268:22.58]I said Yakuza.
[268:23.28]Well, Yakuza is going to be Saturday.
[268:27.34]Remember we were gonna go, uh, House Flipper, Sly Cooper, Yakuza.
[268:35.78]I still don't know which one.
[268:37.08]Probably the new one.
[268:43.05]These are all the subs, that sub today, thanks guys.
[268:48.35]There were a lot.
[268:52.35]It was a lot of money to thank you guys, seriously.
[268:59.26]When are you going to do the auto stream?
[269:02.16]At some point, yeah.
[269:06.94]All Yakuza games are the same game.
[269:08.40]It doesn't matter.
[269:09.36]Oh.
[269:11.44]Maybe I'll play the new one.
[269:12.46]What's it called?
[269:12.94]The Yakuza... The Dragon or something?
[269:17.44]I'll try it.
[269:23.66]The new one is an RPG.
[269:26.54]The new one is way different.
[269:27.62]Oh.
[269:29.81]Alright, well, I'm gonna, I'll do, we'll do, I'll go back to 0.
[269:34.87]I'll do Yakuza 0.
[269:37.97]It's boring.
[269:41.87]I tried, I played Yakuza 0 for like 2 or 3 hours and I gave up on it.
[269:45.32]And I think everybody was very, very upset about that.
[269:47.44]7 is good, what the fuck?
[269:56.40]I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[270:00.54]There are as many Yakuza games as there are Saw movies.
[270:04.44]Is that the Jerma985 subs me?
[270:07.26]That's a fake person.
[270:08.48]It's me.
[270:13.14]Yeah, I'll either do 0 or I'll probably just do 0.
[270:17.32]Or 7.
[270:17.64]Well, I don't know.
[270:19.55]I'll do 0.
[270:19.87]I'm doing 0.
[270:22.07]7 is based.
[270:22.51]Well, if I like 0, I'll do them all.
[270:26.69]I'll see you guys later.
[270:27.41]Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
[270:28.73]See you soon.
[270:30.71]Take care.
[270:31.65]Good night.
[270:33.06]Goodbye.
[271:13.05]Yes.
