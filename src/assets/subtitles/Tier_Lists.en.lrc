[02:34.18]Oh, you piece of crap.
[02:35.00]What are you doing?

[03:55.08]I don't know what this place is.
[03:57.48]Disqualified.
[03:59.92]I don't know what Cashburg is.
[04:03.12]Sonic?
[04:04.58]Awful.
[04:07.40]Subway?
[04:08.00]Awful.
[04:10.48]All the way- I can't put everything in D.
[04:18.76]everything's gonna be it wait hold on I'm gonna hold on I'm gonna leave like this for now I'm gonna piss off a lot of people with this but I don't think I think chipotle's not very good church's chicken I've never eaten it okay
[04:48.36]Quiznos was god tier.
[04:50.70]Absolute god tier.
[04:53.58]But they... Didn't they close permanently?
[05:00.06]I haven't seen a Quiznos in probably like fucking 10 years.
[05:05.33]They're closing them all up.
[05:08.37]Keep it a B. Deserves to be there.
[05:15.15]Mmm...
[05:18.21]I haven't eaten a Little Caesars pizza in a long time, but I remember it was, like, not that great.
[05:25.31]Domino's, no.
[05:28.87]Long John Silver's, no.
[05:32.61]No, Dairy Queen, you know, you're up at C. No, you're at B. McDonald's, B. No, McDonald's, D, no.
[05:44.52]No.
[05:47.22]Jersey Mike's overrated.
[05:52.48]Jimmy John's overrated.
[05:55.73]Moe's.
[05:56.71]Get that up on B tier.
[06:03.55]Moe's is way better than Chipotle.
[06:05.01]I will say that a thousand times.
[06:11.03]Elta.
[06:13.65]Denny's.
[06:15.67]Denny's can be up here.
[06:17.36]Five Guys.
[06:17.96]I don't know if I'd put Five Guys on the Quiznos tier.
[06:25.48]I might.
[06:26.34]Maybe.
[06:30.56]Popeye's.
[06:31.70]Should I take off restaurants that I've never eaten before?
[06:34.70]This is kind of unfair.
[06:37.46]I've drank an A&W soda before.
[06:39.20]Is that alright?
[06:42.24]I've never had Cashberg before.
[06:45.66]I'm not even sure I've ever eaten at Long John Silver's.
[06:48.12]So, it has to come off.
[06:51.47]Make a new tier for uneaten.
[06:55.61]How do I do that?
[06:58.75]Uh... Just make it uneaten.
[07:10.33]Oh, shit.
[07:11.49]No, no, no, no.
[07:13.73]Any of these restaurants new?
[07:19.27]Uh-oh.
[07:22.41]Delete this one.
[07:24.45]There we go.
[07:25.15]Oh, fuck.
[07:25.65]What happened?
[07:26.37]What happened to D?
[07:27.47]I lost D. No, no, no, no, no.
[07:31.15]Add uneaten.
[07:32.69]Got it.
[07:33.11]It's there.
[07:38.61]D. What is going on?
[07:40.78]D.
[07:45.58]How do I add another row?
[07:47.20]Add row below.
[07:48.22]There we go.
[07:48.82]Okay.
[07:50.96]Uneaten.
[07:57.63]That's fine.
[07:58.25]Okay.
[07:59.09]D. Let's put D where it was before.
[08:00.95]What color was D before?
[08:02.37]Like cold?
[08:05.51]Like cold ass food?
[08:06.89]Yeah.
[08:07.31]Alright.
[08:09.03]Where have I not eaten?
[08:15.96]I've never had... I've never eaten Carl's Jr.
[08:20.86]I've never... There's too many things on here.
[08:28.85]Wendy's goes up here.
[08:30.75]For now.
[08:32.31]I don't... I've never eaten at church.
[08:34.99]I don't know what OK is.
[08:37.35]I think... No, this is Del Taco.
[08:39.20]I think I've had this once.
[08:40.68]But I don't even remember eating it.
[08:42.98]So I'm gonna... It's as if I never had it in the first place.
[08:47.49]Chick-fil-A?
[08:49.25]I've eaten it a couple times.
[08:51.27]It was very good.
[08:53.83]Is it better than Denny's?
[08:56.14]Yeah.
[08:58.42]HBO?
[08:58.98]Okay, do I have an HBO Prime subscription?
[09:04.06]Oh, that's Firehouse Subs.
[09:05.64]Okay, I've had Firehouse Subs before.
[09:12.48]I would put it in here.
[09:18.15]IHOP, I'm only putting IHOP down here because I think I've driven by an IHOP more times than I've been inside of a McDonald's.
[09:39.13]That's how I determine if I'm ever going to go there.
[09:43.33]You literally drive by it and you go, oh, there's an IHOP.
[09:46.21]Never going to eat there.
[09:49.70]Oh, we're on the road again.
[09:51.22]Oh, I'm hungry.
[09:53.64]No.
[09:56.20]I could really go for some food right now.
[09:57.64]Something cheap and something... A sit-down place.
[10:00.92]No, I don't think so.
[10:03.18]It's not that I've eaten there before, but I just... What is this?
[10:08.65]Is this Olive Garden?
[10:12.59]I don't know what that is.
[10:13.63]Is it Olive Garden?
[10:14.51]I just see olive.
[10:17.35]Culver's.
[10:20.18]I don't know what that is.
[10:20.90]Cash burger.
[10:21.48]I've never eaten that.
[10:25.02]Krispy Kreme.
[10:26.85]The only experience I have at Krispy Kreme is when my high school did a thing where you bought them and it was a huge deal.
[10:36.55]And I remember eating like two or three of them.
[10:40.35]And thinking it was like, just okay, I guess.
[10:46.05]The last time I had a Krispy Kreme donut, I was probably like 16.
[10:49.57]So I may as well have never even eaten it.
[10:57.17]Because I cannot reliably place it anywhere.
[10:59.19]I've only had it once, like 15 years ago.
[11:03.13]Dunkin' Donuts sucks, but it's alright, though.
[11:06.97]No, I wouldn't.
[11:07.57]What did I put?
[11:08.37]Dunkin' Donuts up with Denny's.
[11:16.82]No.
[11:18.68]No, I wouldn't do that.
[11:20.32]Krispy Kreme is S tier?
[11:21.42]That's fine, but I've never played it before.
[11:22.72]I've never played that game.
[11:27.70]Shits?
[11:29.26]This place is called Shits?
[11:33.24]I don't think I want to eat at the place called Shits.
[11:41.30]Is that what that place is actually called?
[11:43.64]It's called Shits.
[11:45.77]No, it's not.
[11:51.53]I've never had it.
[11:52.35]I don't know.
[11:55.14]Is it fictional?
[11:57.40]People are gonna be mad about this one too.
[12:01.24]In-N-Out Burger!
[12:02.06]Oh, In-N-Out, oh, I can't wait to see where he puts In-N-Out.
[12:04.96]It's gonna be like fucking up on A. It's alright, settle down, it's okay.
[12:18.79]It's just a hamburger restaurant.
[12:21.68]Don't worry.
[12:22.34]It's going to be fine.
[12:38.99]They don't even fucking compare.
[12:40.19]Is it better than McDonald's?
[12:48.54]And I have to go through these, and I have to do each one in an individual subcategory, right?
[12:54.47]So this could be like an A plus down to like an A minus, right?
[12:58.33]I'll take care of this.
[13:05.05]I know.
[13:05.73]I just got to get everything in the right mind zone here.
[13:09.83]I have not eaten here.
[13:13.06]I've eaten here, I think, once.
[13:23.44]Let me remember.
[13:27.41]It was definitely better than, like, Firehouse Subs.
[13:36.14]I think that's accurate.
[13:38.48]This place only does chicken, right?
[13:40.32]This is like the chicken place.
[13:45.92]Fuck.
[13:48.45]I'm having second thoughts about something here.
[13:49.75]Hold on.
[14:06.91]Okay.
[14:07.01]You have to add an F category.
[14:18.46]Do I really have to have it F?
[14:28.02]No, having an F category is just, this is where I put places to get people to unsubscribe the channel.
[14:40.39]Burger King.
[14:41.05]Oh, damn.
[14:41.65]Okay, hold on a minute.
[14:42.43]Burger King goes up here.
[14:44.27]Does it, though?
[14:44.75]Panda Express sucks.
[14:58.51]Okay.
[15:02.39]That's probably the... I don't know if there's any others that are going to be in...
[15:13.52]I've been to like four Panda Expresses and each time it has been... It's been awful.
[15:21.87]I mean, it's been... I'm not saying this to be like the dick or mean or anything.
[15:28.05]It's been awful every time.
[15:31.23]It really has.
[15:34.36]When you're eating food and the only thing that you can think of is
[15:42.40]Yeah, I mean, it's... I wouldn't order this again, but it's... It's edible.
[15:48.41]It's not... It's alright.
[15:49.23]It's edible.
[15:51.67]Yeah, so is a fucking shoe if you chop it up.
[16:05.58]Hold on, though.
[16:06.28]I'm about to bring a lot of people back into my corner here.
[16:16.21]I don't get it.
[16:22.11]In fact, I'm doing this.
[16:28.40]I don't, I'm not a big fan of the way the Starbucks coffee tastes.
[16:31.20]I don't really, it's, it's coffee.
[16:33.84]It's alright.
[16:36.66]But I don't know if it's like, look, here's the thing about Dunkin' Donuts versus Starbucks.
[16:43.03]Dunkin' Donuts, they're gonna screw your order up all the time.
[16:46.13]And sometimes you're gonna drink out of the cup and you're gonna like get like a burning taste in your mouth and you're gonna go like, but it's like three and a half dollars less expensive than this one.
[17:00.14]And if you're gonna drink this one, you may as well just go to like the next level up of coffee.
[17:11.10]Now, that's not to say that if you... I mean, there's a Starbucks everywhere.
[17:15.58]I drink Starbucks fucking all the time.
[17:17.82]If there's a Starbucks in the corner, it's like, alright, well, I'm just going to get a coffee.
[17:20.22]I'm not saying don't ever drink.
[17:21.46]I'm just saying.
[17:23.94]The difference is that it's not that big of a deal if you drink Dunkin' Donuts over Starbucks.
[17:28.95]One of them is quick and fast and cheap.
[17:31.93]The other one is fast and...
[17:42.53]I don't know.
[17:42.83]What's the word I'm looking for?
[17:52.96]Fast and expensive?
[17:56.62]They have some good stuff at Starbucks, though.
[17:58.05]Somebody said the refreshers.
[17:58.93]Those things are really good.
[18:04.12]No, but I would rather drink at like another coffee shop than Starbucks.
[18:08.14]Okay, Tim Hortons, never had it, sorry.
[18:11.58]Sorry to all the Canadians, I've never had it before.
[18:14.58]Arby's, now here's a tough one.
[18:17.16]Because Arby's, depending on the day, Arby's is either a B or an F. I've gone to Arby's before and been like, wow, that was like really delicious.
[18:30.75]And I've been there the other half of the time and it was like unedible.
[18:34.94]I want to throw this in the trash.
[18:38.40]So I don't know where to put it.
[18:40.26]Probably down here.
[18:46.57]KFC?
[18:47.11]KFC can go up here.
[18:51.93]KFC is just like Kane's .4.
[18:54.51]You know what I mean?
[18:59.78]Buffalo Wild Wings?
[19:07.24]My D is going to be full of stuff.
[19:14.30]Fatburger.
[19:15.12]Have I had Fatburger?
[19:16.26]Maybe once or twice.
[19:17.66]Maybe.
[19:19.06]Is it enough to rate it?
[19:23.43]I have to change my opinion on that.
[19:39.27]How is Taco Bell an A?
[19:41.53]It just is.
[19:44.77]Pizza Hut.
[19:46.27]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[19:46.93]What?
[19:47.31]What?
[19:47.67]What?
[19:47.89]Everyone's freaking out.
[19:52.23]The stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut.
[19:56.95]That's my level here.
[19:59.66]Is the stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut better than anything on the Chipotle menu?
[20:04.60]Yes.
[20:05.85]Is the stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut better than anything on the McDonald's menu?
[20:10.04]Yes.
[20:13.46]Better than anything on Jersey Mike's menu?
[20:14.92]Yes.
[20:17.22]Better than anything on Jimmy John's menu?
[20:18.62]Yes.
[20:19.92]Better than anything on the den- the- the- the- den- the- that menu?
[20:24.12]Yes.
[20:25.38]Actually, no.
[20:26.06]That's not- Alright, I got it.
[20:33.75]Yeah, like the patty melt from Denny's is just, it's better than the stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut.
[20:38.53]Fuck!
[20:44.41]Better than In-N-Out, though, for sure.
[20:48.25]Do I have to level?
[20:48.89]I might have, hold on, I might have to level up Denny's.
[20:55.18]You don't have any pizza places above a C. It's because most of the fucking pizza chain places suck.
[21:05.50]No, Denny's is going to be a high C, I think.
[21:08.19]Let's move it over here.
[21:11.99]Look, I really don't want to be like a pizza elitist or a dick or anything.
[21:18.39]But if you live in an area that has, look, pizza places.
[21:22.43]Think about if you just type into your phone or like into Google or whatever, just type in pizza place or pizza nearby.
[21:30.16]There's a pizza.
[21:31.20]There's more pizza places than there are Starbucks's and I'm not talking about like Pizza Hut.
[21:36.65]I'm talking about like Like sales pizza like pizzeria Regina like there's so many pizza places that are better than Pizza Hut There are so many pizza places that exist that are not chained pizza restaurants.
[21:51.42]Why would you ever eat at one of the chains?
[21:53.68]if you live in a city and
[21:57.28]If you don't have that option, then I completely understand, yeah.
[22:00.86]But if there is another pizza place that's not Domino's, it's probably gonna be better than Domino's.
[22:10.10]Eat family pizza, that's right.
[22:17.62]Chained pizza survives off quantity, not quality.
[22:21.48]Yeah, and look, Pizza Hut's out here at sea.
[22:26.21]Domino's is... I just don't like Domino's.
[22:28.81]I really don't.
[22:29.23]I like Pizza Hut.
[22:31.43]I would choose Pizza Hut over a lot of... um... restaurants.
[22:38.05]Like, actual, like, pizza restaurants.
[22:39.53]I would.
[22:41.81]By that logic, everything on this list should be lower than B with all local restaurants at an A or a B. Yeah, I gotta love... I gotta love my local restaurant up here.
[22:50.16]Taco Bell.
[22:53.70]Alright, let's keep going.
[22:56.92]Panera Bread... Let's see... Panera Bread... Once you eat Panera Bread like three times, the... Oh, wow!
[23:09.03]A cheddar broccoli soup in a bread bowl!
[23:10.97]Like, you don't give a shit anymore.
[23:12.28]It doesn't matter anymore.
[23:13.70]It's just like a soup in a bowl.
[23:17.16]If it's your first time eating a Panera Bread, it's probably up here.
[23:20.08]If it's your fifth time eating a Panera Bread, it's probably like over here.
[23:23.82]It's not... It loses its flair.
[23:26.57]It's still alright, though.
[23:27.25]It's still good.
[23:31.15]I don't know what this is.
[23:33.90]What is that?
[23:37.02]I don't know.
[23:40.28]Popeye's chicken.
[23:41.70]Unfortunately, everybody, I've never eaten it.
[23:44.22]I've not had it one time.
[23:45.48]Oh, hold on.
[23:48.32]I'm losing the... Zaxby's?
[23:53.76]Never had it.
[23:55.92]Boston Market, I think I've had it twice.
[23:59.15]Maybe not even.
[23:59.99]And this was like 20 years ago, so the recipe definitely changed.
[24:05.63]Fatburger.
[24:12.06]I don't remember, I like, mmm, it's probably, no, it was alright.
[24:25.29]Jack in the Box is... If you're gonna go to Jack in the Box, just go to McDonald's.
[24:35.72]I've had it a couple times, and it's been, like, cold and gross and awful.
[24:38.54]Same thing with Sonic.
[24:39.74]Make sure Sonic's at F. If it's... My reasoning for Sonic being an F is because I've had it a few times, and every single fucking time, it was cold...
[24:53.24]It took like 30 minutes to come out and was not very good.
[24:59.81]That's just the way it was.
[25:01.33]I've eaten the food there.
[25:06.53]I know Sonic does a bunch of these weird strawberry cheesecake banana lime cream drinks that I've never had one.
[25:17.74]No, I'm not a fan.
[25:23.52]It's a meme restaurant?
[25:27.64]But what about those funny commercial guys?
[25:30.20]Oh yeah, there are the two funny commercial guys.
[25:32.51]Alright, so Wawa.
[25:43.66]I think I've had Wawa before.
[25:47.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[25:49.00]Don't, I'm not gonna look.
[25:49.76]Is Wawa like a bowl place where you make your own bowl?
[25:52.52]And is it like, um, like kind of Asian fusion?
[25:56.74]It is, right?
[26:03.38]Okay.
[26:03.66]Well then I don't think I've ever had it.
[26:12.65]Steak 'n Shake.
[26:14.75]I've had this a few times.
[26:16.82]but not enough to like to make this is the thing there's too many things here I remember being alright it was I remember being like okay what a burger I don't there's too many like burger places I've had too many hamburgers I don't remember I think I've had it once
[26:44.30]And every one of these places that I've had one time was just... Oh!
[26:50.11]Okay.
[26:50.77]It's good.
[26:51.79]But is that like, oh, S tier!
[26:53.45]I don't know.
[26:54.63]See?
[26:57.99]What is this one?
[26:59.47]Somebody gave a lot of money.
[27:00.23]Hold on.
[27:02.24]KXZ just gave another $50.
[27:03.36]Thank you, KXZ.
[27:03.98]Thank you.

[27:41.31]It's probably down here.
[27:42.69]Long John Silver's, I have never eaten it.
[27:44.73]I don't know what this is, never eaten it.
[27:45.91]I thought that was Starbucks 2.
[27:46.83]The rest of these, I don't think I've had at all.
[27:55.02]Wingstop.
[27:59.06]I don't, I've never had this.
[28:01.74]What's Ojan?
[28:05.62]Ojan?
[28:07.44]I've never had it.
[28:09.16]I don't know what that is.
[28:10.42]I don't think I've had any of these.
[28:14.08]Look, I don't eat that much fast food.
[28:16.88]I only eat the fucking S tier ones.
[28:21.02]Checkers, no, I've never had it.
[28:26.71]Half of these restaurants are not even physically available to me.
[28:29.89]My whole life.
[28:31.63]How am I supposed to go to a Tim Hortons when you have to live in Canada to drink it?
[28:36.89]I live in the United States of America.
[28:39.72]There's no Tim Hortons in America.
[28:46.50]There's one in New York.
[28:50.38]Oh, shit.
[28:50.94]I've got to get on that plane and go to New York to drink Tim Hortons.
[29:00.02]This is what I've eaten.
[29:01.32]Let me make sure.
[29:04.78]And I'm going to put the uneaten ones in their own category, places where I probably never will eat.
[29:11.00]The bottom is places I will never eat.
[29:12.68]Place up top is like, you know what?
[29:14.06]I'll check it out.
[29:14.58]It might sound like pretty good to me.
[29:15.79]Remember it's in line.
[29:24.51]So like one, two, this is top to bottom.
[29:28.50]Okay.
[29:31.10]Cashberg sounds interesting.
[29:36.16]I don't know what church is... I'm going to put this up here because I feel like I've had it.
[29:42.53]I remember I walked by and said it looked like I wanted to go in that place.
[29:48.67]I don't know what church... I'm not going to eat here.
[29:50.61]I don't know anything about it.
[29:56.57]Um...
[30:01.08]Krispy Kreme, but would I actually go into a Krispy Kreme donut to buy Krispy Kremes?
[30:06.44]I feel like I would only want that if somebody handed it to me and said, hey, this is a Krispy Kreme donut, do you want one?
[30:12.70]Sure, I guess I'll have one.
[30:15.86]I'm not eating it shits.
[30:18.69]No, I would try shits.
[30:21.37]Yeah, just because it would be like, oh, yeah, I would eat shits.
[30:25.87]Carl's Jr., no.
[30:30.68]I'm not going to eat... Sorry.
[30:32.76]I'm not going to eat at emote Arby's.
[30:41.82]Um... I think that's alright.
[30:56.59]I would eat at this place.
[31:02.02]You know what?
[31:02.94]I want Popeye's.
[31:03.96]I'll try it.
[31:04.74]That's the next place I'm going to eat.
[31:06.52]That's... I don't know if... Is Popeye's even on the West Coast?
[31:11.49]Is it even in Las Vegas?
[31:12.85]Is there one in Las Vegas?
[31:14.03]I will go to it.
[31:20.29]Wait, that's Qdoba?
[31:22.07]Oh, Qdoba's good!
[31:26.31]Alright, let's put this up here.
[31:28.69]I don't know what that was.
[31:30.71]That's pretty good.
[31:31.23]I've had it before.
[31:31.95]It's good.
[31:34.27]I've had it.
[31:34.59]Yeah.
[31:43.35]Alright, let's see.
[31:43.95]What's the worst... That's accurate.
[31:57.21]Where's Chipotle?
[32:03.00]Where's Chipotle?
[32:08.08]Where's Chipotle and why is it not down here at D?
[32:14.31]Where is Chipotle?
[32:20.89]Oh, it's the first seat.
[32:21.73]Get out of there.
[32:22.39]No, it does not belong there.
[32:26.91]Alright, let's go worst to best here.
[32:28.85]So, definitely, Panda Express is always so hit or miss.
[32:33.05]And usually it's a swing and a miss every time.
[32:35.05]I'm sorry, it just is.
[32:37.93]Out of all these restaurants that I think are alright, that I would eat at, which one would I want to eat at the most, or drink at the most?
[32:53.26]Holy shit, I don't know if I can do this.
[33:09.52]Like, I'm not going back to Arby's.
[33:10.66]You know what I mean?
[33:14.80]Fool me once.
[33:16.38]Shame on me.
[33:19.56]Fool me twice.
[33:22.22]You can't get fooled again.
[33:23.15]Whatever he said.
[33:23.77]That funny George Bush thing.
[33:25.71]I don't... I really, really don't like Domino's.
[33:35.31]I don't.
[33:35.83]I think it's bad.
[33:43.15]Buffalo Wild Wings is alright.
[33:44.62]They only do one thing that's worth eating there, though.
[33:47.82]But it is in the title.
[33:51.54]But sometimes they're not.
[33:54.41]But I drive by IHOP and I go, oh, no.
[33:59.97]It's not Papa John's.
[34:00.77]Papa John's is all the way at the bottom.
[34:08.19]Papa John's just tastes like a DiGiorno pizza that you made in your own house.
[34:12.57]You put the DiGiorno in the oven and it came out and it was a Papa John's pizza.
[34:16.07]That's what it tastes like.
[34:19.32]I don't want a delivery DiGiorno.
[34:23.46]I want a delivery pizza.
[34:30.09]Why the fuck is there a Papa John emote?
[34:38.81]It's not delivery.
[34:39.67]I know.
[34:40.27]It's not delivery.
[34:42.25]No, this is delivery.
[34:47.87]No, Papa John's, you bite into the pizza and you take a big bite and every topping and all the cheese and everything just comes off.
[34:55.86]That's why.
[34:56.42]Ooh, was this a mushroom, onions and peppers pizza?
[34:59.89]Let me take a bite of that.
[35:02.27]Oh, oops.
[35:03.17]Oops.
[35:06.58]I'll take my fucking, like, double dare flag that I'm left with.
[35:15.93]No.
[35:17.59]I'm sorry.
[35:32.24]I've made my decision.
[35:34.41]I would drink an A&W root beer right now.
[35:36.19]In fact, you know what?
[35:36.81]Let's get this up here.
[35:38.47]Just because I just saw that and I was like, I want a fresh fucking frosty bug of A&W.
[35:42.85]That goes up to the level because of that.
[35:48.57]I don't know why.
[35:49.09]I just thought this said free Wi-Fi.
[35:54.85]Free Wi-Fi at Buffalo Wi-Fi Wings?
[35:57.71]What?
[35:58.41]That's different.
[35:59.49]That's not the name of the restaurant.
[36:02.55]Buffalo Wi-Fi Wings.
[36:05.19]You get free fucking Wi-Fi.
[36:16.47]This is accurate now.
[36:20.23]I mean, White Castle has the, if I drove by one of these D restaurants.
[36:25.67]Alright.
[36:26.71]Ooh, they made a movie about this.
[36:31.07]He's a cartoon.
[36:32.43]Everything is based on television and fucking movies and video games.
[36:35.51]This is a cartoon.
[36:37.15]Buffalo, this is my sign.
[36:40.20]The Ox.
[36:41.50]And they made a funny movie about this.
[36:43.12]Alright, there you go.
[36:50.30]I got it.
[36:51.80]That looks good, right?
[37:11.67]Perfect.
[37:16.89]Little Caesars is good for the price?
[37:18.17]Don't complain about a $5 pizza.
[37:22.99]Yeah, but a $5 pizza is not that good.
[37:29.39]This is not about price.
[37:35.35]This is about eating and how much I want to eat there.
[37:42.23]but it's five dollars right but that's it's not down here this is so this is almost a c this is almost a d plus c minus to me this is about like what I would want to eat not about like oh hey I mean sometimes it's about like spending less money but I mean look I got like Pizza Hut up here I got like Wendy's at b tier it's about it's not about the cost
[38:10.92]Taco Bell is A for me.
[38:13.82]It's like a dollar for a taco here.
[38:17.32]Best thing we... Oh, I can tell you right now.
[38:19.88]And you're solidifying the reason why it's up here.
[38:22.73]Cheesy gordita crunch with a Doritos, nacho Doritos taco shell is the reason... If that wasn't on the menu, this is down here.
[38:32.69]I swear to fucking God.
[38:35.45]That menu item brings this from an F to an A.
[38:47.71]That's the worst menu item.
[38:51.23]You and I got some beef now.
[38:52.53]We have a problem.
[38:54.52]That's like the best.
[38:55.28]That's my favorite thing to ever eat at a fast food restaurant.
[38:57.38]It's the best thing.
[38:57.96]It's the fucking best thing in the world.
[38:59.38]I want one right now.
[39:03.30]Cheesy gordita crunch.
[39:04.91]I will write it down.
[39:05.83]I'll use my one chat message for 30 minutes.
[39:10.39]I'll make sure you get it.
[39:39.18]Don't do that, though.
[39:43.94]Tweet it out.
[39:44.88]No, I can't tweet out food stuff anymore because people think I'm like a monster.
[39:52.24]It's fucking so good.
[39:53.97]Alright.
[39:55.73]We're getting ahead of ourselves here.
[39:58.85]If I were to do the IHOP drive-thru, I would stop the car and I would turn in if it was a Little Caesars.
[40:07.63]That's what would happen.
[40:10.73]Where's D'Angelo's?
[40:12.21]Now that's a really good question, because D'Angelo's would be up here.
[40:16.30]Can I just pretend that this is D'Angelo's?
[40:18.64]Quiznos doesn't exist anymore.
[40:21.92]Where's Puppagino's?
[40:25.70]Puppagino's and D'Angelo's.
[40:26.96]Puppagino's, I mean, it's like a New England thing, but Puppagino's is some of the best chain pizza I've ever had.
[40:33.97]Puppagino's is up here.
[40:36.51]Or here.
[40:41.31]Papa Gino is the best Papa in regards to pizza places.
[40:47.93]That's a New England place, yeah.
[40:49.83]But that's not fair.
[40:51.13]In-N-Out's a fucking West Coast thing.
[40:52.49]Why is it on here and not Papa Gino's?
[40:57.58]Okay, I'm going to pretend this is D'Angelo's.
[41:01.02]If it's Quiznos, it can stay there, but I'm going to pretend it's D'Angelo's.
[41:06.98]I might have to make some changes though.
[41:08.22]Alright, so we got... This is important because this is like places that... Remember, these, it's not about... Jersey Mike's is so much better than... No, no, no, no, no.
[41:22.05]But I'm not going to stop for Jersey Mike's.
[41:24.83]I'm not going to like... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[41:31.97]If I see those golden arches...
[41:36.66]you might get me to stop depends on how hungry I am I'll drive by and I'll get just the waft of the dumpster as I'm going through and it'll be really disgusting and you'll get that like wet trash smell while you're in the drive-thru and you're like oh and then you keep going and you realize the reward for your for your dedication two plain McChickens with mayo and lettuce
[42:07.30]Big Mac meal.
[42:09.88]Come on.
[42:12.81]You can't beat it.
[42:13.47]It's unbeatable.
[42:33.88]Can I be honest with you?
[42:34.52]I can be honest with you, right?
[42:40.05]These three restaurants are the same restaurant.
[42:46.20]They're the same place.
[42:48.20]That's why they're together.
[42:54.33]When I think of, like, Whataburger, if I was inside of a Steak 'n Shake, and you told me it was a Whataburger...
[43:03.54]but the sign said Fatburger, I'd be like, this is the same thing.
[43:08.71]This is just a cheeseburger.
[43:11.29]When you're talking about Shake Shack though, that's how you level up.
[43:27.80]We get it.
[43:28.68]Shake Shack doesn't sponsor anybody.
[43:32.01]You think Shake Shack needs to sponsor somebody?
[43:34.57]The reason why Taco Bell probably sponsors people is because... No, never mind.
[43:42.03]Alright.
[43:43.10]Slow down.
[43:49.68]These two.
[43:51.06]They even have the same name.
[43:54.16]Jimmy John's.
[43:55.68]Jersey Mike's.
[43:58.17]Jersey Jim's.
[43:59.39]They're the same fucking restaurant to me.
[44:04.43]Jim, Jersey, Jim, John, Sub, Sandwich, Mike.
[44:07.75]Mike, Jim.
[44:10.57]It's just two, it's like name and then place.
[44:13.29]Jim, Mike, Jersey.
[44:18.90]John.
[44:19.24]Yeah, fuck that.
[44:35.54]I feel like these are rivals.
[44:37.82]These are guys that are across the street from each other.
[44:40.16]That, like, prank each other.
[44:45.19]This is like, the Bob's Burgers made an entire, like, storyline about this.
[44:50.07]And it's real.
[44:53.23]This is just the other restaurant.
[44:54.57]This is like the, but no, this is way worse than that because this is the same, they're the same name.
[45:04.59]Sandwich shop sitcom.
[45:06.21]Yeah.
[45:08.27]Alright.
[45:08.94]I'm getting ahead of myself here.
[45:10.46]That's not fair.
[45:11.06]Chipotle's at the very bottom.
[45:29.51]I'm sorry.
[45:29.83]It has to go there.
[45:32.24]I don't like that place.
[45:33.72]And I'm not going to eat there.
[45:35.38]I'm not going to stop there.
[45:36.32]I'm not going to stop at Chipotle.
[45:38.56]Chipotle is not that... I'm not going to eat there.
[45:41.47]They're everywhere.
[45:43.57]It's next to Starbucks because there's as many Chipotles as there are Starbucks.
[45:47.07]And they're usually right in the same fucking mall.
[45:50.49]Connected at the wall together.
[45:56.68]But which would I rather go in?
[46:11.43]I can't have it up at sea.
[46:16.29]I understand why this would be here.
[46:20.19]I've had... You know what's funny?
[46:22.15]I've had one of these, but they're both the same restaurant to me, so I don't know which one it was.
[46:28.31]I have no fucking idea.
[46:30.91]It was a sandwich place, and it had somebody's name in it.
[46:34.62]It was just... And the signs, they used the same red letters...
[46:41.79]it's just I can't help it I'm sorry why is KFC a C we're getting there hold on I gotta make sure that this is correct
[47:12.25]Denny's is way too high.
[47:13.90]McDonald's and Denny's are up a little too high, I think.
[47:28.69]You just put Burger King in front of In-N-Out.
[47:43.82]Kim loves in and out what happened bro you just what what what was it was it loud let me listen to it show it to me what was it was it loud noise was it that was it that loud I'm sorry I didn't think it was that loud where's my headphones was it loud
[48:13.04]I just scared the shit out of your cat.
[48:28.42]You just put Burger King in front of In-N-Out!
[48:33.24]Wasn't that loud?
[48:45.09]OK, yeah, it was.
[48:49.93]It was very loud.
[48:54.55]I just didn't have my volume turned up.
[49:01.62]Could you believe what he fucking did?
[49:03.44]I saw it.
[49:04.92]Did you?
[49:05.26]Wait, what's going on here?
[49:08.56]Oh, we're fine.
[49:16.27]But I was saying, Kim loves In-N-Out.
[49:20.46]I think, me not so much.
[49:21.52]I think it's alright.
[49:22.34]It's definitely better than Burger King.
[49:23.40]That's a joke.
[49:23.94]I'm kidding around.
[49:27.42]Kim said my list is wrong.
[49:28.44]My list is not done.
[49:30.22]Not even close.
[49:31.16]So, hold all criticisms until after it's done.
[49:38.61]Everybody's talking all this smack about my list.
[49:42.78]And they have not.
[49:43.78]What am I doing?
[49:44.44]OK.
[49:44.58]Alright.
[49:57.92]Instinct.
[49:58.24]Here we go.
[50:30.08]What did Kim say?
[50:38.47]Where's Kim's cooking?
[50:39.59]I can't like put that's not a fast food restaurant.
[50:51.02]Kim making food is not a fast food restaurant.
[50:53.32]That's not like going driving up to Burger King.
[50:59.26]Are you saying that she's too slow?
[51:01.26]No.
[51:02.18]Kim is not a restaurant.
[51:07.12]He hates it.
[51:07.70]I haven't even tasted it.
[51:08.64]I haven't even tasted.
[51:10.32]I'm talking about like today.
[51:17.83]No, whatever.
[51:20.37]cooking is very good okay let's stop get back here this is done this is done
[52:09.47]I feel like I'm playing chess.
[52:13.35]My stream is frozen.
[52:14.71]Because I'm just sitting here.
[52:18.71]Okay.
[52:22.01]C is done.
[52:23.83]Now, importantly, this is, like, I might have to make a few changes here.
[52:44.70]They give me the fries in the bag and the fries soak at the bottom of the bag and it gets all oily and shit.
[52:53.82]They just, oh, I want a fry.
[52:55.10]Here you go.
[52:58.77]Look, I want french fries.
[53:08.39]I don't want to eat eight potatoes.
[53:13.14]I don't like those I don't like the fries I don't I like the like the shitty plastic fries I like the ones that are like dyed yellow wicked thin shoestring and crispy I don't like the but I like the potato like you bite into it and it's like eating a baked potato no I'm not a big fan they look I don't like potato wedge type fries I like the fake gross shitty ones and I know that that's wrong I know that's the wrong opinion but okay that's fine
[53:41.50]It's also up at B tier, which means it's really good.
[53:43.66]So, I don't know what the problem is.
[53:47.23]This is going to be hard.
[53:49.21]Hmm.
[53:50.63]I've had these both the same amount of times, and I thought they were both very good.
[53:59.53]They got a sauce.
[54:00.17]That sauce is better.
[54:01.39]They have a sauce here.
[54:02.81]That's better.
[54:05.43]Nothing beats Moe's in this list.
[54:21.89]I just don't remember eating these.
[54:24.19]I've never had them.
[54:24.97]Like I've had them once and I thought they were good, but they were the same burger.
[54:30.25]I'm trying to teleport my brain and my memory back to when I ate Whataburger and it was just the same thing I did when I ate the other, when I ate Steak 'n Shake.
[54:38.18]It was just, I was sitting in the same chair with the same burger and the same flavor.
[54:44.69]I don't have any other memories.
[54:49.75]I don't have memories for this.
[54:51.75]They're all the same.
[54:53.23]I'm looking through like the VR goggles of like the burger just going like in.
[54:59.46]You know what?
[55:00.40]That was his mouth.
[55:02.88]I don't have any other memories.
[55:14.56]I don't think Five Guys is better though.
[55:28.06]One of these was juicier.
[55:28.98]I don't remember which one.
[55:30.14]One of these was juicier than Five Guys.
[55:40.59]Cheese was melted perfectly at one of these places.
[55:44.91]I don't remember which one it was.
[56:00.97]Somebody just came in and said, in and out C tier.
[56:03.47]What the fuck?
[56:09.33]You know it's only up there.
[56:10.77]It's up a full letter grade because of like, it's on stream.
[56:18.24]You know what I mean?
[56:21.04]Like, that's like the streamer tax here is, no, I don't know.
[56:24.70]It's pretty good, man.
[56:25.66]It's a pretty cool, pretty awesome place.
[56:28.32]See, in my mind, it's over here.
[56:32.96]But I can't say that.
[56:34.22]I have to say that it's like, okay, I have to say it's good enough.
[56:44.29]It's the streamer tax.
[56:46.33]It's like the, I'm on camera tax.
[56:53.77]I'm fucking kidding.
[56:54.63]In and out is, here's the thing I don't like about in and out.
[56:57.61]And we're going to talk, we're going to dial the shit talk up to 11.
[57:02.96]Anytime you go to In-N-Out and the burgers are fine.
[57:06.54]Okay, what do I want to order at In-N-Out?
[57:10.26]Oh no, you're doing it wrong.
[57:11.32]Don't order anything off this menu.
[57:14.46]What are you talking about?
[57:15.42]Why?
[57:16.56]Well, because there's like 30 fucking secret things to order and they're all way better than the stuff on the menu.
[57:22.07]Why don't you just fucking put it on the menu?
[57:24.36]Oh, uh, animal fries.
[57:25.36]See, what they do is they open up a fucking, a thing, a thousand island dressing and they dump it on your fries and they add like bacon bits to it right out of the cabinet.
[57:35.62]Fucking cool.
[57:40.42]Alright.
[57:44.81]That's a straw man.
[57:51.38]These boys are like tomato slices.
[57:52.92]What do they do?
[57:53.34]They take like tomato slices and like Thousand Island dressing.
[57:57.94]And then you like pick up the fries and it's like... Did you just time out?
[58:14.79]I didn't time out Kim.
[58:18.09]Wait, why did Kim get banned?
[58:24.32]Why did that happen?
[58:31.75]I'm just taking the piss.
[58:34.03]In-N-Out is fine.
[58:35.85]But... Why does it have to be this, like, trendy secret menu thing?
[58:40.99]Just put it on the menu.
[58:43.73]They have, like, three or four different burgers that you can order, and none... It's just... It's not a secret.
[58:50.66]Look, it's not a secret when everybody knows it.
[58:55.58]Oh, shh.
[58:56.64]Don't tell anybody about those animal fries that every single fucking customer orders.
[59:03.82]Every single customer orders these.
[59:07.88]Shh.
[59:09.56]Don't tell anybody about that secret.
[59:11.57]It's a secret menu.
[59:19.55]Don't tell anybody about those animal style fries.
[59:23.83]Word might get out.
[59:31.65]Alright, we've spent a lot of time on In-N-Out, but I gotta... Double-double animal style is good, but not worth the 15-minute wait.
[59:40.82]Oh god.
[59:43.10]Mute!
[59:43.58]Mute the microphone!
[59:44.30]Quick!
[59:54.23]She brought a dog.
[59:56.09]You wanna say how to auto?
[60:02.55]Hello, Otto.
[60:05.00]He can't time me out in real life.
[60:07.12]I didn't even time you out.
[60:08.48]Okay, but I don't want to raise my voice in front of Otto.
[60:10.90]So, okay.
[60:13.94]What would you change on this?
[60:15.42]This entire list is wrong.
[60:16.92]How?
[60:17.16]Why is this wrong?
[60:17.94]Look, in and out.
[60:18.46]Okay, first of all.
[60:21.08]What would you replace?
[60:22.18]Okay, you get one thing to replace.
[60:26.00]Which one is it?
[60:28.46]Fuck.
[60:29.62]I don't want to raise my voice in front of Otto.
[60:36.47]Show dog.
[60:37.85]No, we only get to see Otto for 10 seconds.
[60:40.97]Alright, so what would you change?
[60:44.29]For a second, I thought you just had a Jersey Mike's t-shirt on.
[60:47.45]And I was like, what the fuck are you thinking?
[60:52.94]Jersey Mike's.
[60:56.90]Okay, first of all, why is White Castle there?
[60:58.68]Put it like F. White Castle is like a joke restaurant, though.
[61:06.51]White Castle is like a, I thought it said Jersey Mike's.
[61:10.46]Alright, White Castle has a movie behind it, though.
[61:13.32]It does?
[61:15.44]Wait, it does?
[61:17.66]Harold and the two guys go to White Castle.
[61:20.68]Oh, I've never watched Harold and Kumar.
[61:22.61]Nothing.
[61:23.11]That's the only reason why it's up here.
[61:24.67]Otherwise, it would be an F. I'm not going to read that.
[61:33.87]Alright, so we got, look.
[61:36.35]Where would you put In-N-Out on this list?
[61:39.87]In-N-Out is fucking better than Panera Bread.
[61:43.10]Is it, though?
[61:45.36]I mean, it's better than Banana Bread and also Panera Bread.
[61:50.14]Did you say it's better than Banana Bread?
[61:51.82]Yeah, okay, I'll agree.
[61:55.36]In-N-Out's better than Banana Bread, but that's not up here.
[61:57.69]That's not an option.
[61:59.63]It's better than Panera.
[62:01.99]Have you ever even had Firehouse Sub?
[62:03.79]Have you ever had a bread bowl soup from Panera?
[62:09.67]It's better than- are you telling me that an In-N-Out burger is better than a bread bowl cheddar broccoli soup from In-N-Out?
[62:15.48]I mean from Panera.
[62:16.32]Okay, but like it's all bagged to soup.
[62:18.22]Where do you think they get this from?
[62:21.58]Do they think the cow comes in and they're like, oh, yeah, bring it in!
[62:24.58]No, they all come out of a fucking bag.
[62:27.90]Hi.
[62:31.02]Oh, what's Atto think?
[62:32.57]Atto, what's your favorite restaurant?
[62:35.80]Oh, he was so cute that he just said that on camera.
[62:40.86]I mean, also, like, why is Taco Bell, like, wait, okay, so there's an S tier, which is Shake Shack, and I know that that's true for you.
[62:49.65]See?
[62:50.23]But, like, why is, um, why is Taco Bell an A-list fast food restaurant?
[62:57.15]Why wouldn't it be?
[62:57.67]It's got the cheesy gordita crunch with the nachos, doritos, locos, tacos.
[63:00.36]Wait, have I ever had a cheesy gordita crunch?
[63:03.14]Have I ever had that?
[63:05.10]never had she's never had the cheesy gordita crunch from Taco Bell and she's wanting to talk about why it's an eight here just saying is you know you gotta have you gotta have a little bit of uh you gotta have some some stuff to eat first before you I mean and that's why I have the uneaten side I mean I've only ever had from Taco Bell I mean we had it a couple nights ago but I ordered the same thing every single time we're going there
[63:30.74]Because Taco Bell is A tier, and you find the thing you like at Taco Bell, and you eat it every time.
[63:36.13]That's giving it a high order.
[63:37.61]I don't know.
[63:39.85]That's not, this is not correct.
[63:41.35]Is this worth the couch tonight?
[63:43.85]We're talking about fast food restaurants.
[63:46.84]It's not like, oh, yeah, I'm on the couch tonight, guys.
[63:51.90]I can't believe I liked the cheesy gordita crunch better than In-N-Out.
[63:55.60]Where is my cooking on this list?
[63:57.85]Your cooking is all the way up here.
[64:00.50]up at s s plus if they're okay but is it better than shake shack if I could put another category up here that said s plus I would and it'd be Kim's fucking perfect cooking but no but that would be an insult to your cooking because this is a fast food list and that would mean that your food would be like in the same realm as a fast food restaurant and it's not as a home cook wait you don't like Sonic
[64:30.82]Wait, you don't like Sonic?
[64:35.82]Sonic sucks.
[64:38.04]How many times have you eaten at Sonic?
[64:40.62]I'm from the East Coast.
[64:43.12]I used to eat Sonic all the time.
[64:45.12]That's not a quantifiable number of amount of things.
[64:48.25]Dozens of times.
[64:49.83]Okay.
[64:50.97]So I've had Sonic twice.
[64:53.83]So it was not good.
[64:55.23]Both times I had it, it was not very good.
[64:58.31]It was very, it was very cold.
[65:00.43]It was, I got, I got cheesy tater tots and it was, they, it's almost like they, there was cheesy water tots, what I would have called it.
[65:08.00]That's a cheesy water tots.
[65:09.40]It's like the funny, like laugh out loud term that I'm going to use.
[65:11.94]Wait, you've never had Popeye's before?
[65:13.72]No.
[65:14.98]Oh, it's so fucking good.
[65:16.04]That's what I'm saying.
[65:19.38]The worst item on the menu is the cheesy tots.
[65:23.02]Well, that's like in every commercial.
[65:24.96]They're like falling down.
[65:26.12]There's like cheese going all over the place.
[65:28.58]You didn't get the chili cheese toss.
[65:30.02]No, I don't want diarrhea.
[65:32.39]I'm not going to put... Guys, adding chili to a fast food menu item is giving you like plus 60% chance for diarrhea.
[65:43.85]Do you get a spicy bum from chili?
[65:46.69]Now we're going to cut the mic.
[66:05.06]Wait, you've never had this before?
[66:11.35]Why?
[66:11.57]Why?
[66:13.83]Nope.
[66:15.61]We're back.
[66:16.11]Okay.
[66:17.13]So, uh... Wait, you've never had... Wait, what is this?
[66:20.11]What is this right here?
[66:21.29]Cash... What is... I don't know what... Cashberg.
[66:24.54]Look.
[66:24.88]Can you see?
[66:26.60]It looks like Ashberg.
[66:28.78]I thought... From what I can see.
[66:31.08]It's Smashburger.
[66:33.59]Oh, the restaurant that we saw?
[66:35.21]Oh, Smashburger!
[66:36.47]It's going up here!
[66:37.91]We've never even had it before.
[66:40.23]Wait, the restaurant that we saw in front of them?
[66:42.39]Yeah, we've seen it before.
[66:43.41]Yeah, we've seen it before.
[66:45.83]We've seen it.
[66:47.67]I've driven by it like three times.
[66:51.74]Was there one in Boston?
[66:55.60]No, I think there's one in LA, though.
[67:02.20]We might have seen it when we were there first.
[67:06.06]Everything is a burger.
[67:10.63]You've never had Carl's Jr.
[67:11.77]either?
[67:12.59]No.
[67:13.69]I've had Carl's Jr.
[67:14.67]once.
[67:17.35]Let me see.
[67:20.19]No, this is, look, look, look.
[67:21.05]You gotta look, this is all the uneaten category.
[67:24.35]So,
[67:25.92]Why is Subway on this list?
[67:28.98]It's F. Did you see the grade?
[67:30.18]That's an F. That means it's the worst thing on this list.
[67:33.33]And that's Panda Palace, right?
[67:37.51]This?
[67:38.01]What is that place?
[67:38.43]That's Panda Express.
[67:39.65]Panda Express.
[67:44.23]It doesn't matter.
[67:45.41]It's not... I don't like it.
[67:47.71]What's this person?
[67:48.85]What's this little guy right here?
[67:50.49]That's Caesar.
[67:51.63]Oh, that's F. He conquered Rome and...
[67:56.10]What do you mean F?
[67:58.54]Caesars?
[67:59.74]Pizza?
[68:01.14]Why would it be?
[68:01.58]It's not F. Have you had it before?
[68:03.12]Yeah.
[68:03.86]I've brought an entire box home.
[68:06.42]Wait, we've eaten this before?
[68:09.43]I didn't eat it, but I brought it home and Alan ate it.
[68:11.75]Have I eaten this?
[68:13.67]I think you might have.
[68:14.55]What did I say?
[68:16.89]I don't know.
[68:17.31]We threw it in the garbage the next day, so I mean...
[68:36.22]alright so alright alright so that's Little Caesars apparently Jack in the Box alright can I can I finish can I finish my list no because it's wrong caesars caesars is worse than panda egg panda land why can I not think I can't get the name of this place in my brain Panda Express

[69:13.61]What time is it?
[69:14.23]It's 10 o'clock.
[69:15.19]I shouldn't be asking for coffee.
[69:16.49]Do you want some?
[69:18.08]Alright, I'm going to get a coffee.
[69:23.90]Come on, let's go.

[70:40.17]Okay, there we go.
[70:44.95]What was that, like, frame?
[70:46.09]Uh, so I think I have confirmed, uh...
[70:51.66]That was not Little Caesars.
[70:53.84]That was a local place.
[70:56.00]It's going back up.
[70:59.18]I actually remember the name of the place!
[71:00.58]That's kind of a similar name.
[71:10.60]Why is Little Caesars- I doubt- I was misled.
[71:13.06]I have not had it before.
[71:16.36]I've had it like... twice.
[71:19.92]I've won it, though.
[71:21.64]I've won it.
[71:27.31]Then it's uneaten.
[71:28.03]No, but I have eaten it, though.
[71:29.29]Back in Massachusetts, I've had it like a bunch of, at least twice.
[71:35.12]What is this E?
[71:35.62]What was this E mode?
[71:49.03]I'm gonna finish my list.
[72:05.08]Okay, looks good.
[72:16.85]It's done.
[72:25.15]This is my emo tier list.
[72:48.27]Wait!
[73:28.11]Just got here.
[73:28.49]What the fuck is this?
[73:30.06]What's wrong with this?
[74:03.56]That's it!
[74:04.12]That's done.
[74:04.86]Perfect.
[74:13.48]I was fighting with that the whole time.
[74:23.83]So, let's get this straight.
[74:29.79]Panda...
[74:33.68]Panda Express is the worst restaurant I've ever been to.
[74:35.96]On this list.
[74:36.28]Restaurant.
[74:36.72]Restaurant.
[75:02.37]no it's not but is it better than subway it might be no it's worse than Pizza Hut yeah by about two letter grades is it worse than McDonald's yeah I mean I've had better experiences from McDonald's is it dom stick with my list
[75:41.35]Alright, that's good.
[75:41.99]Any other lists to do?
[75:53.46]What is this?
[75:54.12]What is this?
[75:54.52]FileMaker, FileMaker, FileMaker.
[75:56.50]What is this?
[76:00.28]Wait, why is there a... That's... Okay.
[76:07.08]I thought that said FileMaker.com.
[76:16.15]OK, this is my emotes.
[76:17.73]I have to write my emotes.
[76:20.89]Don't make me do this.
[76:22.76]Actually, this is going to be pretty easy.
[76:30.70]OK, copy that link.
[76:32.71]Let's go here.
[76:35.49]And it should just go, right?
[76:38.79]Let's go.
[76:45.95]OK.
[76:55.11]I'm just preliminarily getting them out here.
[77:15.06]OK.
[77:17.66]abcd a b c d we need a f tier no there's no there are there are no f tier emotes I'm going to say I would put
[77:47.45]How did you make this?
[77:58.32]I'm actively right now going through the process that I said I wanted to go through a long time ago.
[78:04.30]And that was... I want to go for what emotes I think are the better ones and which ones are the worst ones.
[78:08.18]So thank you for... Let's do it.
[78:12.37]We're doing it on stream.
[78:13.21]Alright.
[78:36.83]You can't touch those two.
[78:45.68]This is preliminarily.
[79:00.11]I like the top half of the Jupiter better than the bottom half.
[79:21.60]Let me think, let me think, let me think, let me think.
[79:39.45]Alright, hold on.
[79:45.99]That's correct.
[79:47.04]I don't need to do any changing here.
[79:53.31]I would probably say... Look, just because it's used the most doesn't mean I think it is the best.
[80:02.21]Still up there.
[80:13.76]I really... I kind of like... I like the one guy where it is.
[80:40.42]What do I think is the board?
[80:41.57]Which one is so close to being dropped?
[80:49.42]The TV has no purpose.
[80:53.18]It just doesn't.
[80:53.74]There's no purpose for the TV.
[81:11.99]Honestly, I like mustard more than I like... Yeah.
[81:20.28]Can anybody even do that emote?
[81:23.44]Anybody here even have the capability to do that emote?
[81:32.33]Can I even do that emote?
[81:37.65]Oh, yeah.
[81:40.14]Speaking of subscription emotes, Tingy just came in with 10 community subs.
[81:44.42]Thank you, Tingy.
[81:46.38]10.
[81:46.64]Count them.
[81:47.56]10 community subs.
[81:50.57]On top of the fucking hundreds at this point, I think.
[81:55.01]Thank you, Tingy.
[81:56.19]That's a shitload of fucking money, and I'm surprised that you want to give me that kind of support.
[82:00.85]Thank you.
[82:01.75]That means a lot.
[82:04.19]There are people that can do that in the chat.
[82:11.43]I'm comfortable with this.
[82:13.81]Find out whoever did that and ban them.
[82:19.31]I like this.
[82:21.31]I don't need very much.
[82:22.29]I know all of my children here.
[82:31.88]I mean, I have to do this.
[82:33.90]This has to be complete.
[82:35.24]Otherwise, it'll freak me the fuck out.
[82:38.16]I think that's good.
[82:44.58]That's pretty good S and A tier here.
[82:48.06]These 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... That's pretty good.
[82:52.06]I would probably go like this though.
[82:53.58]Like that.
[83:03.37]I think that's perfect the way it is.
[83:08.63]I've judged... This is fun to do.
[83:10.43]I think I'm going to do this again.
[83:14.52]Did it really take me an hour to do that McDonald's tier thing?
[83:21.78]Nobody uses jermaPop?
[83:22.80]That doesn't mean it's not the best emote on the channel.
[83:37.11]What tier would I... A stream tier?
[83:40.23]What do you mean?
[83:49.57]He likes his own face.
[83:50.77]No, that's up there because that's the first emote I ever had.
[83:53.54]And I still think it's the best one.
[83:58.08]This one, just by sheer volume, that's probably the most used emote in the whole channel.
[84:04.33]And I think I did a pretty good job on that.
[84:07.77]I did a close-up of my face.
[84:10.79]And that's it.
[84:22.77]Now it's perfect.
[84:28.59]Now it is.
[84:29.37]No.
[84:29.97]Now it is.
[84:30.33]Now it's not.
[84:46.16]Now it's perfect.
[84:49.34]Not touching anymore.
[85:01.27]No, it's perfect the way it is.
[85:03.27]Perfect the way it is.
[85:03.89]Don't need to do anything else.
[85:10.91]Alright, guys.
[85:11.41]I think that's time to go.
[85:18.17]I'll see you tomorrow.
[85:21.43]Me and Ster are going to do something tomorrow afternoon.
[85:26.47]I don't know what the hell it is, but we're going to do something.
[85:30.16]some type of multiplayer game and if not then look we're gonna have to figure something out because we both agreed hey uh let's do something let's do a vid stream together that'd be fun so something's gonna happen tomorrow between 3 and 4 p.m pacific time thanks for watching I'll get out of the way now there's your final list there
[85:59.65]And that's a nice place to call it, I think.
[86:06.41]I think so.
[86:08.47]That was Salmon Max Season 3, Episode 1.
[86:16.43]We will return to that probably next week.
[86:19.13]Because tomorrow is me and Star doing something.
[86:22.11]And then a few days later we'll probably do... I have a couple of ideas.
[86:27.95]You will see Episode 2...
[86:31.54]Sooner than you think.
[86:37.22]I'm scrolling down the list of bits right now, and there are a shitload.
[86:43.21]There are a ton of bits.
[86:45.15]There are hundreds and hundreds of them.
[86:49.25]All trying to bring the score down.
[86:51.89]-2.
[86:58.15]Oh, there's so many here.
[87:05.33]holy shit the Google search results for cheesy gordita crunch have increased by 300 in the last hour good I hope you eat one but let's go back to earlier
[87:32.32]Thank you for joining me on this stream.
[87:36.02]And if you take it off, maybe we'll see you tomorrow.
[87:37.50]If not, we'll see you again soon, maybe?
[87:44.54]So, we had $2.50 from Zake.
[87:49.52]Thank you, Zake.
[87:51.56]Thanks for buying food for my family every day ever since our dad left.
[87:54.88]You're a good man.
[87:56.17]I just don't think that eating only cheesy Cheetos for five months straight is very healthy.
[88:03.83]Thank you for the $2.50.
[88:04.71]Appreciate it.
[88:12.89]Thank you to Red Ramen for the $10.
[88:19.38]$10.
[88:19.40]Vodboy here.
[88:20.24]Watch out, chat.
[88:20.86]Jerma has a real knee slapper coming up.
[88:26.30]Oh, that's a Vodwatcher.
[88:27.52]I see.
[88:27.78]Okay.
[88:42.88]Thank you, Red Ramen.
[88:43.82]Enjoy the VOD!
[88:46.67]It's a good one.
[88:47.41]It's a good one.
[88:59.15]Hey, back in thanks for the four dollars!
[89:02.13]Uh, they say -2.
[89:06.50]There are a lot now.
[89:09.18]Uh, 25 cent bits.
[89:12.58]that have minus 2.
[89:15.04]It is more than probably 50.
[89:18.32]25 cent bits that say minus 2.
[89:21.14]Minus 2.
[89:22.84]Minus, minus, minus, minus, minus.
[89:25.90]Minus, minus.
[89:30.11]Somebody did a plus 2.
[89:31.17]Uh, more minuses.
[89:36.33]I wonder what this fucking chart would look like.
[89:38.85]This is one.
[89:39.35]You're gonna wanna look at that one.
[89:41.05]Somebody's gonna wanna chart this one.
[89:44.95]Somebody said, have fun getting rich, clever streamer.
[89:49.88]Oh, Espada.
[89:50.84]Espada Escalata gave $2.50 in the middle of that.
[89:55.34]And they say -2.
[90:00.07]More of that.
[90:00.93]More, more, more.
[90:03.17]It then turns into...
[90:05.60]Halfway through up here, it turns into, for a 25 cent -2 bit messages, to 25 cent, 750 people subscribe to the channel, my weightlifting sub copy pasta.
[90:21.45]Like, 50 times here.
[90:24.68]Espada Escalada, thanks for the 250.
[90:27.27]Chad Jerma puts down the -2 insurrection with videos of him getting ripped, but spawns a copypasta to rival JermaCraft.
[90:35.13]Now that's a +2 material.
[90:42.96]There's more of this?
[90:51.18]This went on for a while.
[90:52.88]It was 30 straight minutes of slow-mo.
[90:58.15]JermaLiedAboutTacoBell.
[91:00.14]Hello, JermaLiedAboutTacoBell.
[91:01.80]How are you?
[91:02.60]I put your restaurant at A tier and it was the only one that was there.
[91:09.66]Congratulations.
[91:12.16]Uh, Jerma, I just got here.
[91:13.08]What the fuck happened?
[91:17.46]I don't even remember.
[91:18.46]I remember it was... It was also wrong.
[91:23.49]That's so... You can think that.
[91:32.05]What was that laugh?
[91:35.55]That was a laugh to rival Beavis and Butthead.
[91:42.73]It was all a blur before the tier lists.
[91:44.47]Kind of was, weirdly enough.
[91:48.63]It was.
[91:49.01]It really was.
[91:50.27]I don't even remember any of them.
[91:51.67]I don't remember any of Sam and Max.
[91:53.59]Did we play it?
[91:57.54]Hey, Twunksty1, thanks for the $2.50.
[91:59.43]This is somebody's first Jerma stream.
[92:02.09]Well, every one of my streams is somebody's first stream.
[92:08.09]Let's just hope that they come in while I'm just hanging out and having a good time.
[92:15.44]Hey, Mad47, thanks for the $15.
[92:17.68]$15 from Mad.
[92:19.72]Can you still curl those 35s or are you too old?
[92:21.93]I can't do it.
[92:26.09]It's just 21.
[92:26.59]Oh, okay.
[92:28.63]I'll remember.
[92:29.03]I just add... No, I say twanksty.
[92:36.14]21.
[92:37.84]No, I can't do that anymore.
[92:45.53]I could probably barely do 15 to 20 pounds 10 times on each hand.
[92:49.81]It's been too long.
[92:53.07]But... I did used to love working out.
[92:56.40]I felt great.
[93:03.37]But thank you for the $15, Matt.
[93:05.47]Appreciate it.
[93:12.86]More 25-cent bits that... I just want to read one.
[93:16.82]Just checking if you can skip the 30-minute wait time.
[93:21.12]You're going to get so much -2 when this is done.
[93:25.50]I kind of didn't, though.
[93:26.62]It only happened for about five seconds.
[93:36.24]We also had... Oh my god, there's so many of these.
[93:43.68]You did this to yourself?
[93:45.70]Is this a scam to make people pay money?
[93:49.36]How many people made alt accounts to say, fuck you right now?
[93:52.52]Jerma's dumb.
[93:54.29]We are winning.
[93:59.35]Hey, Jerma, when's the next TF2 vid?
[94:01.29]That is the one that came through.
[94:06.32]Plus, W plus, thanks for the $5.
[94:07.80]Jerma, thank you for sharing your wonderful personality with the world.
[94:11.34]I said this before, as my one chat message, but you didn't read it, so now I have to say it.
[94:16.47]I have to pay to say it.
[94:21.19]Well, thank you for the $5.
[94:21.93]And thank you for listening.
[94:26.87]Thank you for being here.
[94:30.85]Without you, there is no me.
[94:35.82]In a streamer sense.
[94:40.42]If there wasn't people watching, I don't think I would have kept doing it.
[94:46.89]So, works both ways.
[94:48.99]Thank you.
[94:57.09]We also see... Let's see...
[95:01.59]One of these 25 cents that came in is funny.
[95:03.49]It says, you can't focus on the game because chat is too slow and engaging.
[95:09.62]Nice bit extortion.
[95:18.70]It's just a ruse.
[95:24.68]When the streamer does a 30 minute bit for money, Jerma disgusts.
[95:31.98]Viewers dropping low engagement.
[95:34.26]Sell, sell, sell.
[95:41.29]Let me out of the jar.
[95:42.29]I'm suffocating.
[95:45.05]Release me.
[95:49.49]How do I grow up to rule Twitch chat with a fist of iron like yours?
[95:54.67]Shave your armpits.
[95:55.91]Armpit shaving stream.
[95:57.59]Shave armpits.
[95:59.83]These are all 25 cent donations that came in.
[96:07.81]Uh, somebody says, fuck you, Baskin Robbins mom's baking cookies ice cream is a Mother's Day only ice cream.
[96:13.91]I went into Baskin Robbins and I looked like a fool.
[96:16.35]What?
[96:18.59]No, it's not.
[96:21.20]No, it's not.
[96:28.64]It's not, is it?
[96:37.44]No, it's there.
[96:38.30]It's there.
[96:38.72]Dude, I've looked for that ice cream in six stores.
[96:49.29]I can't find it.
[96:50.81]Really?
[96:51.19]No, it's there.
[96:53.33]You gonna get it?
[96:58.49]It's definitely not seasonal.
[97:03.74]Hey, Azzy Dreamer, thanks for the five community subs.
[97:07.88]welcome thank you and congratulations to the five lucky contestants that got the community subs thank you appreciate it thanks for the five subs somebody has a question in here um somebody this is one of the random just 25 cent like just it was just flowing in here
[97:36.07]really not the best place to ask this question, but I'm going to answer it because it's a strange place to put this.
[97:42.29]In the middle of the 25 cent spam, there's somebody that says, I'm looking for a lost video, Jerma.
[97:47.23]Where's that Twitter video of a star wasting a bunch of money he won from you in a bet on McChickens?
[97:52.94]I can't find it.
[97:57.54]I don't, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[98:03.58]I don't know what you mean.
[98:05.01]I don't know.
[98:05.51]I don't know.
[98:06.17]I don't recall that Twitter video.
[98:09.59]I don't know what that means.
[98:13.15]I'm sorry.
[98:17.63]Hey, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $2.50.
[98:19.91]Why did you empty your Google Play wallet on Twitch bits?
[98:23.04]I'm sorry, Mom.
[98:24.18]I had to tell my favorite streamer how much he sucked with them.
[98:35.10]Thank you for the $10 from... uh... Poo... Pookie?
[98:41.84]Pook... It's, uh... Pookie, Pookie, Pookie?
[98:46.01]I think?
[98:48.35]You pick, yup.
[98:49.77]Just like that Nickelodeon you pick.
[98:52.25]Get your toll-free phone out and dial 1-800-You-Pick-Nickelodeon.
[98:56.51]Press 1 for Doug, press 2 for Ren and Stimpy, press 3 for Our Real Monsters.
[99:00.04]You pick.
[99:06.37]What's the... Did I say this, like, two weeks ago?
[99:18.09]I mean, that's a real thing.
[99:21.63]Well, thank you for the $10 regardless, Pookie.
[99:25.89]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $3.
[99:27.41]Based on how Twitch searches their chats, you're gonna get your account flagged for botting because of this stupid bit.
[99:34.65]Nah, I'll be alright.
[99:36.47]They got fucking data.
[99:39.39]All they need is the data and they're good to go.
[99:51.30]This is like when each text used to cost money.
[99:54.72]Us boomers are used to this.
[100:02.60]We're calling collect to chat.
[100:04.91]That's a good one.
[100:05.69]That's right.
[100:10.89]I can only do this twice, so I better make this count.
[100:14.73]Did you?
[100:19.75]No, you didn't.
[100:29.77]And yes, that was the second message.
[100:37.40]Maybe it was worth it.
[100:49.39]Swiggity-swanky, thanks for the five dollars.
[100:51.05]This all started when you encouraged chat by noticing the memes.
[100:55.45]Don't you realize you are an enabler of chat?
[100:59.54]If you started going on a tirade about pee-pee-poo-poo, chat would go insane.
[101:03.98]You went off the rails with this one, big boy.
[101:06.33]I estimate that this damage you've helped create will last only a few weeks, so nothing permanent, like hair loss.
[101:16.22]And they fucking had a... Really?
[101:18.22]Really?
[101:19.94]Another gnome link?
[101:23.50]Uh, thank you.
[101:26.00]This is, uh, from C4G.
[101:28.11]Thanks for the $5.
[101:28.91]Hey, Jerma.
[101:29.83]I think this is the end of the bot.
[101:31.35]It had a good, weird run, and this was a perfect finale for it.
[101:34.23]Thanks for letting it stick around for so long.
[101:36.33]Absolutely.
[101:36.79]And there's a link.
[101:40.45]Okay.
[101:43.65]Uh, thank you for the $5.
[101:44.65]I really appreciate that.
[101:46.41]Add the bot.
[101:46.85]Why?
[101:47.09]The bot doesn't have to go yet.
[101:48.67]The bot can stay here.
[101:53.56]The bot's fucking awesome.
[101:55.45]It's a great idea.
[101:57.31]Yeah, maybe after a little while, it might, maybe it'll start to derail streams.
[102:00.61]But I like the derailment that it does now.
[102:02.93]So it's okay.
[102:04.93]Thank you for even contributing that at all.
[102:08.45]That was C4G.
[102:09.61]Five dollars.
[102:11.40]Uh, thank you.
[102:13.00]Master Chicken, thanks for the $2.50.
[102:14.26]There's a link.
[102:15.36]Let's click it.
[102:18.05]Thank you.
[102:18.67]Jerma, I've been watching you since the first days of TF2 with Star, and this is the first time I've had money to donate.
[102:23.26]Just want to say that you've been a constant positive part of my life.
[102:26.34]Also, if you don't do the Jerma, where's Waldo?
[102:28.22]I'll be mildly upset.
[102:32.18]I probably will just do that.
[102:33.06]Don't worry.
[102:37.59]Thank you, Master Chicken.
[102:39.19]Absolutely.
[102:40.65]We will do that.
[102:41.11]It sounds like a lot of fun.
[102:43.67]This next one is a $5 donation from... uh... somebody with just a link.
[102:49.33]Let's click it.
[102:52.49]Nice.
[102:54.13]And it says, thank you.
[102:55.61]Thank you.
[103:00.61]No, let me just click the next four or five links in a row.
[103:06.21]Okay, there's no more links after that, so I'm done with clicking links.
[103:23.45]E-word, twerky, word, twert.
[103:24.65]Thank you for the 250.
[103:25.77]Let's see what this is.
[103:26.41]It's a link.
[103:26.73]Let's click it.
[103:30.69]E-word, twerky, word, twert.
[103:34.08]E-word, twerky, word, twert.
[103:37.42]E-word, twerky, word, twert.
[103:38.66]E-word, twerky, word, twert.
[103:41.66]On PC, please.
[103:42.90]Thank you.
[103:44.18]Probably.
[103:46.04]Not.
[103:47.04]I don't see why not.
[103:47.88]Probably.
[103:48.86]Unless, of course, there's a reason why I wouldn't.
[103:50.24]Tomorrow, not the next day.
[103:51.62]Probably not.
[103:53.54]Not.
[103:53.64]On legendary mode.
[103:54.85]Just kidding.
[103:55.53]Delete that.
[103:56.77]Demons V, thanks for the $5.
[103:58.35]Thank you.
[104:00.49]You're a lot about Halo.
[104:03.51]He tends to do that.
[104:06.11]Thank you, though.
[104:06.73]E-word, twert, E-word, twert.
[104:07.65]Thank you for that.
[104:10.63]Thank you to... E-word, twert, E-word, twert.
[104:14.79]E-word, twert, E-word, twert.
[104:17.39]Nailed it.
[104:19.25]Uh, hey, guess who?
[104:20.59]Another 250 from, uh, E-word twerty word twert.
[104:27.12]What is this?
[104:29.04]Uh, E-word twerty word twert, thanks for the five dollars.
[104:31.16]It's the same clip.
[104:34.53]Well, it's the same clip twice.
[104:35.79]I think that they may, maybe they thought they screwed it up on the first one, but you got it on the first one.
[104:39.09]Thanks for the five dollars total.
[104:43.91]Dr. Clay, thanks for the 250.
[104:45.63]I thought this was your voice for a second.
[104:53.01]Emergency.
[104:54.15]Engine failure.
[104:55.51]Emergency.
[104:58.14]Emergency.
[104:59.26]Engine failure.

[105:18.97]Could be.
[105:25.49]E-word twerk.
[105:25.99]E-word twerk.
[105:26.47]Thank you for the 250.
[105:29.33]And thank you, Dr. Clay.
[105:31.19]Do you remember a lot about Taco Bell?
[105:32.21]Thanks for the $3.
[105:34.09]I have never seen a Panda Express outside of a mall food court.
[105:41.77]I know.
[106:10.15]uh panda panda pal no it's panda it's I can't my I cannot say this it has to be a different second word every time Panda Express panda land panda palace panda time like it has to be I I cannot say express every time
[106:41.74]But I really do have to say a very special thank you to, uh... E-Wordsword, E-Wordsword.
[106:51.81]Thank you to... KXZ for the 30 bucks.
[106:59.91]$30 from KXZ on top of the other huge drops of money from KXZ.
[107:05.33]Your average Taco Bell meal is just a biological war crime waiting to happen.
[107:09.67]What the fuck?
[107:15.58]Thank you.
[107:16.94]Taco Bell is... good.
[107:21.51]One item.
[107:25.94]Other items on the list?
[107:27.82]Sure.
[107:28.64]I've ordered a taco from Taco Bell before.
[107:31.52]And it may as well have just been nachos because it was just crushed up lettuce and stale, gross shell with meat dumped on it.
[107:42.39]You probably stepped on it.
[107:45.41]Like stomped on it before giving it to me.
[107:51.57]You order a cheesy gordita crunch, which I'm going to do right now.
[107:54.97]No, I'm not.
[107:55.89]No, I'm not eating taco.
[107:57.31]No, I have this rule where I can't eat fast food more than once every, like, couple weeks.
[108:03.88]I can't do that.
[108:04.80]No.
[108:08.42]I can't.
[108:11.25]But thank you, KXZ, for the huge amount of money.
[108:16.45]Appreciate it.
[108:18.89]JermaLiedAboutTacoBell thanks to the 250.
[108:20.83]Come on, man.
[108:21.25]I was trying to let the Jerma lied meme die and then you go and rate Taco Bell an A. Uh, Phylactery Lich gave 50 bucks earlier that I missed.
[108:34.33]And I'm sorry I missed it.
[108:36.89]But they said, you take this money to Popeye's and educate yourself.
[108:42.21]I will.
[108:43.53]I will go get the biggest bucket of chicken that they sell at Popeye's.
[108:47.11]And I will eat it.
[108:48.18]Off-stream.
[108:52.85]Thank you for the $50, Phylactery.
[108:56.89]Really appreciate that.
[108:57.71]It's a lot of fucking money.
[108:59.15]Thank you.
[108:59.43]I have to go get the Cajun fries?
[109:02.68]Sure.
[109:03.48]I'll try them.
[109:06.50]Hey, Dork Cube, thanks for the $2.50.
[109:08.86]Well, now that you've poked the dragon with fast food discussion, shout out to all the Cookout and Bojangles fans.
[109:15.08]You should do a frozen food tier list next.
[109:17.19]I might be able to guess who's number one.
[109:20.09]I would do those.
[109:22.76]That was fun, just to kind of sit there for an hour.
[109:26.56]I liked that.
[109:27.40]That was cool.
[109:28.46]I had a lot of fun.
[109:33.11]Kid Cuisine, S tier.
[109:34.37]Kid Cuisine is definitely F tier.
[109:37.63]You would probably get more nutrients eating dirt from the ground.
[109:41.17]Go, like, your, like, father's grass clippings will probably keep you going more than Kid Cuisine will.
[109:52.32]Just Ster up your father's grass clippings from the lawn and just Ster it into water and drink it.
[109:57.10]I'm sure that would be probably better for you.
[110:06.40]That was my childhood, you monster?
[110:07.67]Me too.
[110:11.99]Hungry man.
[110:15.58]All jokes aside, I really don't think I could do a frozen food list.
[110:19.72]Because I haven't eaten them in such a long time.
[110:22.60]I don't eat frozen microwavable dinners.
[110:30.18]I would not be able to do that list.
[110:33.15]Should I eat a bunch of them before we do that?
[110:38.25]Why am I saying this isn't going to happen?
[110:44.43]Hey, bake me home.
[110:45.31]Thanks for the $2.50.
[110:45.83]Take a shower, you smell.
[110:46.93]I might... I don't know.
[110:49.81]Maybe... I don't think I do.
[111:03.23]No.
[111:03.69]I got deodorant on.
[111:05.11]I'm fine.
[111:10.10]But thank you, Bake Me Home.
[111:10.84]Thank you, True Proxy, for the ten bucks.
[111:12.46]Thank you, Jerm, for always giving me the most genuine laughs of all.
[111:15.71]Have a thousand bits.
[111:17.59]I will very graciously take them.
[111:20.05]Thank you so much, True Proxy, for the ten dollars, one thousand bits.
[111:23.17]I will gladly take them.
[111:24.15]Thank you.
[111:26.26]Uh, What Fridge, thanks for the five bucks.
[111:28.08]The secret menu exists because they haven't changed their actual menu since the day they opened.
[111:31.80]And it's sort of a key part of their business model.
[111:34.52]Same how their prices barely change year to year.
[111:41.86]Yeah, but at what point does the actual menu be trumped by the secret menu?
[111:50.26]When your menu of the secret menu is bigger than the actual menu, don't you think you should, like, switch them around?
[112:11.81]Uh... I'm kidding.
[112:12.71]I'm not gonna do it again.
[112:14.41]Thank you, Milkshake, for the $3.
[112:16.99]In-N-Out is S-tier.
[112:18.15]In-N-Out is S-tier.
[112:19.15]In-N-Out is S-tier.
[112:20.21]In-N-Out is S-tier.
[112:21.28]In-N-Out is S-tier.
[112:30.24]I... You guys thought I was making that up.
[112:34.30]When I was, like, screeching and, like... Like, reading and...
[112:42.19]I tell you, you're not allowed to say in and out is bad.
[112:45.43]That's why it has the streamer tax, the I'm on camera streamer tax of it being high somewhere in Cs.
[113:03.08]In and out is alright, it is.
[113:06.06]I would eat in and out if somebody said let's go to in and out.
[113:08.92]I'd be like, yeah, fucking that sounds pretty good.
[113:17.69]Man, I would also skydive if I had.
[113:19.32]I could build up enough courage to do that too, right?
[113:24.34]Kidding.
[113:28.78]It's alright.
[113:29.34]It's just a hamburger.
[113:41.60]Fuck.
[113:42.46]Jeremiah, Shake Shack is overrated.
[113:45.05]You've never had it before.
[113:50.98]You've never had it before.
[113:58.41]And by the way, Shake Shack has a better chicken sandwich than most restaurants that specialize in chicken sandwiches.
[114:05.04]They got a twofer.
[114:07.36]Better chicken sandwiches than most of the chicken sandwich restaurants.
[114:09.90]Better burgers than the burger restaurants.
[114:19.21]Come on.
[114:22.59]Try it.
[114:23.27]If you have it, it's available.
[114:26.04]Alright, you know what?
[114:31.12]You got me there.
[114:35.44]You got me there.
[114:36.02]Shake Shack... The fries at Shake Shack are dog shit.
[114:40.85]Yeah.
[114:42.13]Still last year, though.
[114:47.83]Because they spend so much time and so much effort crafting such incredible quality sandwiches.
[114:54.42]That something has to get left behind.
[114:55.60]And do you really care if the fries aren't that great?
[114:59.90]Alright.
[115:00.98]The fries from Five Guys and the fries from Shake Shack.
[115:07.47]It's the afterthought.
[115:11.31]You just don't order the fries then.
[115:12.61]Just get two sandwiches.
[115:14.95]Fries aren't good for you anyways.
[115:16.96]It's just starch and oil.
[115:19.39]You shouldn't even order them anyways.
[115:21.61]Get a chicken sandwich and get a hamburger.
[115:32.62]What are the best fries?
[115:35.66]That's actually pretty easy.
[115:37.92]The best french fries you can possibly get from a fast food restaurant
[115:53.93]McDonald's right when they come up if they're fresh McDonald's fresh fries are better Burger King is pretty close if they're fresh Burger King fries are really close if they're fresh I would say burger kings are the best but here's the issue Burger King's fries are never fresh
[116:18.07]That's like a 1 in 100 chance.
[116:20.35]And unless you're feeling pretty lucky, I wouldn't do it.
[116:26.02]You get the fresh Burger King fries, though?
[116:30.22]Hard to beat.
[116:34.57]Wendy's fries?
[116:35.15]Wendy's fries are good.
[116:36.83]I would put them... They're pretty standard.
[116:39.09]Should we go back to the list and do fries only?
[116:40.71]Kidding.
[116:46.22]Do a fry test.
[116:47.08]I would do that.
[116:48.46]That sounds like a good idea.
[116:49.36]I'm going to do a fry taste test.
[116:52.65]I'm going to get fries from Shake Shack, McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, In-N-Out.
[117:06.89]Popeye's has fries?
[117:09.05]Interesting.
[117:12.43]They won't be fresh?
[117:13.19]Yeah, they will.
[117:20.88]Thank you.
[117:22.92]JermaLiedAboutTacoBell for the $2.50.
[117:24.71]Do you ever accidentally call your streamer friends by their Twitch channels?
[117:27.33]That's all they call them.
[117:28.55]I don't call them anything else.
[117:31.79]I know Star as Star.
[117:36.76]That's what I say to him in actual, in real life.
[117:41.16]Etalyx is a Etalyx.
[117:42.26]Etalyx.
[117:44.56]The only reason why I call Kim Kim is because Kim is her username.
[117:53.28]You know what I'm saying?
[118:05.39]Try the other, um... Incredible Orb.
[118:09.71]That's Orb.
[118:11.47]Hey, Orb!
[118:11.91]Hey, Orb, Orb, Orb, Orb.
[118:15.13]I don't call him by his first name.
[118:18.39]Boo, yeah.
[118:20.53]Boo is just Boo.
[118:22.73]Boo.
[118:34.89]But yeah, that is how it happens, usually.
[118:38.75]Demons V, thanks for the $5.
[118:43.83]Appreciate the $5.
[118:52.14]You called Nova James before.
[118:53.86]Isn't that what people call him?
[119:02.32]It's usually by, like, what, like, people call you.
[119:05.34]In your community, is what I usually go by.
[119:09.69]It's actually easier to remember people's handles than it is to remember their names.
[119:13.57]Interestingly enough.
[119:21.11]Because there could be, like, a hundred Johns.
[119:24.05]But, you know, there's only one.
[119:28.31]Excommunicado.
[119:30.46]Three.
[119:31.80]Right?
[119:34.48]That's the only person with that name.
[119:43.16]You could be like one of 20 Dans or Daves that I know.
[119:47.76]Or you could be... The Strangler49444.
[119:51.22]That's just who you are.
[120:05.96]Hey, RT, thanks for the $5.
[120:07.40]Just want to say thank you for bringing some laughter and joy to me in an otherwise shitty day.
[120:12.46]We had to put my father's dog down today and I've not been taking it well.
[120:16.24]Watching the stream and reading chat has helped me, so thank you.
[120:20.26]I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
[120:26.95]Losing an animal is tough.
[120:29.55]It sucks.
[120:31.45]I really hope that
[120:33.94]that dog was able to live a nice, good, long life.
[120:40.05]And if it was for other circumstances, then hopefully the time that the dog did have was full of love.
[120:46.65]So I'm really sorry to hear that.
[120:48.23]Thank you for the five dolls, and by all means, we are very, very happy to take your mind off it.
[121:00.07]Sorry to hear that.
[121:05.65]Thank you for the $5.
[121:11.73]We also had $10 come in from Azzy Dreamer on top of the community subs that came in as well from Azzy.
[121:21.92]Thanks for all you do, Jerma.
[121:22.80]I've watched you since TF2 days and watching you on YouTube helped me through so much of my darkest times in my life.
[121:27.36]Have a good one.
[121:30.16]You as well.
[121:30.78]You have a good one too.
[121:34.70]Thanks for watching for that long.
[121:40.75]Yesterday, reminiscing, and watching some old videos, and watching me mention TF2, I really do like miss that stuff.
[121:53.72]You almost like plant yourself back five, six, seven, eight years ago.
[121:58.71]It's like, oh, this was fucking a ton of fun.
[122:03.95]But then I think about now, and... This shit's a ton of fucking fun, too.
[122:10.46]Five, ten years from now, I'll be looking back to this stuff, going, Oh, that was a great time.
[122:17.58]That was a lot of fun.
[122:18.78]Remember when we did that?
[122:19.60]Well, that was great.
[122:20.56]That was so cool.
[122:23.70]So it works always sort of in perpetuity when you look backwards.
[122:29.52]So thank you for the ten bucks.
[122:30.60]Thanks for sticking around for that long.
[122:39.09]And I hope to see you around more.
[122:40.83]Hopefully you stick around even longer.
[122:42.47]Because there's so much more going on to do.
[122:47.83]Thank you though.
[122:50.09]Let's get the community subs.
[122:53.53]There were a lot of them today.
[122:55.87]On top of the... All the bit donations that came through.
[123:03.43]And of course the regular resubs.
[123:04.75]And the new subs.
[123:05.75]People that just didn't get a community sub.
[123:08.97]Community subs come through so often now.
[123:11.91]That... It's almost like they're taking a huge, huge portion of actual subbed people to the channel.
[123:20.84]So, that's... Thank you for that.
[123:24.58]Whoever you are, whenever you do it, some of you guys are responsible for tens, dozens, hundreds of people on the channel subbed.
[123:35.26]So, really appreciate it.
[123:39.34]Why don't we show all those names now?
[123:48.61]Here are tonight's subs.
[123:54.74]Thank you all.
[123:59.74]Somebody says, it's going to be weird when I've been watching Jerma since I was 12 and be like 30 in 10 years.
[124:07.60]You know, that works both ways, right?
[124:11.46]That means I'll be 44.
[124:17.49]Don't really want to think about that.
[124:25.97]I don't even want to think about 35.
[124:30.13]Because I've mentioned this before, but I'm at that stage right now where I don't get to pick the 18 to 34 drop-down box anymore.
[124:38.83]One more year, and I've got to do the thing I have never done, and that's pick the one 35 to 55.
[124:44.27]Mm-mm.
[124:56.85]There are a couple more bits to do.
[124:59.49]We have Internet Jorge for the $15 from Internet Jorge.
[125:06.26]Take my offering so that us peasants may never suffer your wrath again.
[125:09.38]Wrath.
[125:14.08]If I was a seven deadly sin, what would I be?
[125:19.92]What do you think?
[125:24.52]Pride.
[125:24.94]I don't think so.
[125:27.12]Sloth?
[125:31.79]No, I'm sorry.
[125:33.87]Pride, lust, greed, envy.
[125:43.26]Pride, lust, wrath, greed, envy, gluttony.
[125:53.82]Pride, Lust... Pride... Pride, Lust, Rage, Greed... No.
[125:58.32]Pride, Lust, Wrath, Greed, Gluttony, Envy... What's the other one?
[126:08.51]Pride... Lust... Gluttony, Greed... Sloth, Envy... Who am I missing?
[126:24.59]I have to write them down.
[126:31.91]Wrath, Pride, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony, Greed, Wrath, Pride, Sloth, Greed, Wrath, Pride, Lust, Envy.
[126:43.60]Is that seven?
[126:47.46]Wrath, Pride, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Envy.
[127:01.52]What's the... Wrath, Pride, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Envy.
[127:08.19]That's six.
[127:13.07]No, it's not... Is that seven?
[127:26.00]Okay.
[127:26.76]Which one would I be?
[127:29.75]The eighth sin.
[127:30.67]But what I was trying to say, somebody said short.
[127:34.27]Oh yeah, wrath, pride, sloth, greed, gluttony, lust, envy, short.
[127:40.15]Funny.
[127:45.06]I think I would be a combination of... I don't think I have any of these things.
[127:55.78]How come there's no seven awesome sins?
[128:00.00]You know?
[128:00.36]Like, how come, why is it, why is it not like a holy equivalent to this?
[128:03.52]What is it?
[128:04.12]With the Ten Commandments, right?
[128:08.37]Instead of the seven deadly sins, where are like the seven things, cool things to do?
[128:15.29]Oops, I tried to hit enter to like do another... The seven virtues!
[128:19.02]Okay, wait, seven virtues.
[128:20.36]What are they?
[128:23.68]Let's see if, okay.
[128:25.06]Chastity, Temperance, Charity, Diligence, Patience, Kindness, and Humility.
[128:36.27]Where's, like, Jacked?
[128:45.01]Temperance, Charity, Diligence, Patience,
[128:55.62]Do a tier list of the sins and the virtues.
[128:58.76]No, not tonight.
[129:10.01]Maybe we'll do it again.
[129:10.95]Maybe we'll do it again another night.
[129:21.31]Books of the Bible tier list.
[129:26.26]What, are you trying to get me like a reservation downstairs?
[129:31.03]Easy.
[129:35.11]Oh, we had one final bit coming from Mitchell.
[129:39.50]Thanks for the five dollars.
[129:40.38]I think I have Freedom Force.
[129:42.10]Didn't I play Freedom Force?
[129:42.88]Oh, that was Freedom Fighters.
[130:08.56]Freedom Force.
[130:13.38]What's the final tally?
[130:14.42]I don't know.
[130:15.56]The bot got eaten alive.
[130:22.04]Truly a minus 1000 stream.
[130:28.19]What did I do today?
[130:28.97]We did episode 1 of season 3 of Sam & Max.
[130:33.03]And then I spent way too long deliberating over a fast food tier list.
[130:44.21]But thank you, everybody, for watching.
[130:46.99]I'll see you tomorrow.
[130:48.24]The plan is Star and I are going to do something.
[130:49.96]I don't know.
[130:50.44]We'll see.
[130:51.22]Plans change, but that's what's supposed to happen.
[130:54.80]See you tomorrow at the normal time, somewhere around 3 to 4 p.m.
[130:57.84]Pacific.
[130:59.72]See you tomorrow.
[131:02.21]Have a great one.
[131:30.47]you
