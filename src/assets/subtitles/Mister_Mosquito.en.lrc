[00:00.99]Alright, I did it, I'm good.
[00:04.09]Hey, what you guys don't know is, before every stream, with the mic muted, I sit here and I get ready.
[00:10.77]It's an old theater technique.
[00:13.36]Where you kind of, you hype yourself up and you get yourself ready for the day, for the performance.
[00:19.06]Everybody has their own thing that they do.
[00:21.70]Me, I go like this.
[00:24.84]This is how we do it.
[00:25.94]This is how we do it!
[00:27.02]This is how we, this is how we, this is how we do it!
[00:29.48]And then I press Start Streaming.
[00:35.06]I do it every single time.
[00:51.20]Hi guys, welcome.
[00:52.49]We got some stuff to talk about.
[00:55.71]Do you actually, though... What do you think?
[00:58.85]Yeah.
[01:04.08]I'm something of an actor myself.
[01:07.94]Talking stream?
[01:08.70]Not a talking stream, but an explanation stream.
[01:14.33]They're out there today.
[01:17.73]That must be like a fucking rumor convention today.
[01:20.89]I'll tell you.
[01:27.09]Twitch has been acting up today?
[01:28.17]Hmm.
[01:31.26]Well, uh, my...
[01:33.61]thing that I want to talk about has to do with the stream that was planned today.
[01:38.88]You said Twitch is acting like a doofus.
[01:40.44]Well, Jeremy is acting like a doofus too.
[01:44.40]Because, I'm sorry to say this, scratch tickets are not sold in Nevada.
[01:56.59]There is no state-run lottery.
[01:58.53]There is no lottery.
[01:59.55]There are no scratch tickets in the state of Nevada.
[02:03.31]It's one of only six states in the country.
[02:10.24]So I can't buy scratch tickets.
[02:14.81]There's too much gambling.
[02:19.57]So, there are a few things here to discuss.
[02:27.26]Yeah, that was planned well.
[02:28.51]I just... Dude, this is coming from... Remember, I'm a recent transplant to Las Vegas.
[02:35.73]I lived in Massachusetts my whole life.
[02:39.29]And every gas station, every convenience store just had scratch tickets.
[02:43.68]All of them.
[02:44.88]Every single one.
[02:45.48]So I'm just used to seeing scratch tickets.
[02:48.80]And I just assumed completely that they're just everywhere.
[02:52.16]Every state, every county...
[02:56.12]And they don't exist in this state at all.
[03:05.89]So here's a possible scenario, and I'm going to tell you a possible scenario.
[03:09.95]It's not illegal for me to scratch scratch tickets in the state of Nevada.
[03:17.72]But I cannot buy them here, and I can't cash them in here.
[03:21.74]So what I might have to... Here's two possible scenarios.
[03:26.50]Scenario one, we retroactively just say every death in Sekiro was a dollar to the Nevada Humane Society.
[03:36.26]$221 goes right to the Nevada Humane Society.
[03:40.37]Okay, that's option one.
[03:42.95]Option two is have somebody buy the $221 worth of tickets in Massachusetts, send them to me,
[03:55.44]I scratch him here, and then when I go visit Massachusetts, which I plan on doing in the next, like, 30 to 45 days, I have a plan to go visit my family.
[04:06.39]I cash him in there.
[04:11.28]Because it's not illegal for me to actually scratch a ticket here.
[04:14.56]I just can't do anything with it here.
[04:23.06]Go to the California state line.
[04:24.36]Yeah, but the California state line is still... That's like a three-hour drive.
[04:29.48]It's like a two-hour... That's a boomer tactic.
[04:35.06]I don't know.
[04:35.40]I'm not sure what we're gonna do.
[04:36.52]I haven't figured it out yet.
[04:37.36]I was very defeated this morning when I realized what was gonna happen.
[04:41.43]But... Listen, listen, listen, listen.
[04:44.43]Listen.
[04:44.71]And somebody says just do it online.
[04:47.22]I think there's a... I don't... Like, gambling online, I mean, I could do that, but I don't really... I don't want to do, like, online gambling...
[04:59.26]I feel like that's another level up.
[05:01.99]Versus just kind of scratch tickets for charity.
[05:05.89]Kind of thing.
[05:07.33]I don't really want to go to an online slot vendor and just... I don't know.
[05:11.85]I'm not comfortable with it.
[05:13.83]I have no problem with gambling.
[05:16.89]I live in Las Vegas.
[05:18.41]And I hit up casinos every so often, right?
[05:21.75]But I don't really want to do it on stream.
[05:25.80]I don't really want to... It's not necessarily about promoting gambling, but like, Oh, big win!
[05:31.13]I did it, guys!
[05:32.97]I don't know.
[05:33.43]It just doesn't sit too completely well with me.
[05:39.61]Don't have a problem with it.
[05:40.47]I just don't personally want to do that.
[05:42.55]But... Regardless... That's how that stands today.
[05:52.38]2020 hindsight should have probably...
[05:55.63]But why would I have tried to research that?
[05:59.85]You know what I mean?
[06:00.34]Like, are scratch tickets legal in Nevada?
[06:02.84]It's the gambling state.
[06:05.06]This is the state of gambling in the country.
[06:10.41]But, regardless, I can be dejected all I want, but it doesn't matter.
[06:15.65]Today, we're still... Jerma Slots is still on the table today.
[06:18.72]We're still gonna play that.
[06:20.44]If you don't know what that is, somebody in the community just made an entire video game.
[06:27.08]And... It's... They've been working on it for a long time.
[06:32.76]They've been giving updates in the Discord, and...
[06:36.50]There's a lot of interesting things in it, apparently.
[06:38.42]I haven't played it, so we're going to kind of experience it together.
[06:45.01]And there's a lot of interesting things in it, apparently.
[06:46.69]It seems fun.
[06:47.37]Apparently, there's like over an hour or two of content.
[06:50.35]So it's like a full-on video game.
[06:54.54]Actual dev in the chat.
[06:55.58]Oh, I would assume.
[06:56.40]The actual dev in the chat is an actual member of the community.
[07:02.22]Real dev in chat.
[07:03.44]So we're doing that later.
[07:06.65]Because I figured I'd rather play Mr. Mosquito, which is a game I've been trying to kind of throw in for a while now.
[07:14.45]So play Mr. Mosquito until we're kind of sick of it.
[07:17.65]However long that takes.
[07:18.63]You know, maybe a couple hours, two or three hours, I don't know, maybe an hour, who knows.
[07:23.02]I might play the game for ten minutes and go, I want to do something else.
[07:26.46]So Jerma Sloth will come after Mr. Mosquito.
[07:33.82]It's not very long.
[07:34.62]Yeah, but we'll see.
[07:36.81]So, with that said, hopefully you guys have listened to my whole spiel here.
[07:45.72]And we're gonna start off with Mr. Mosquito.
[07:48.36]This is an old game about being a mosquito in somebody's house.
[07:52.44]That's the whole game, there's nothing else in it.
[07:54.40]You just have to try to drink blood from people in a house.
[08:00.69]So we might as well just get it started.
[08:09.59]Open crates?
[08:10.70]No, no, no.
[08:11.28]That's not the same.
[08:13.88]The whole idea was I was going to donate the money to charity and if I open like 100 TF2 crates, what the hell am I going to do with like 40 McDonald's shotguns?
[08:38.16]Flip them on the e-market.
[08:39.28]Yeah, I'll get like 12 cents for each one of those like reskinned color, you know what I mean?
[08:46.62]It's like, that's bad.
[08:50.25]This is blinding in here.
[08:52.81]That's a reference to one of my old videos, yeah.
[08:54.79]You picked up on it.
[08:58.67]This is from Fresh Games.
[09:03.19]You wouldn't get two cents.
[09:04.41]Zoom computer create.
[09:05.99]What did that say?
[09:07.77]This game contains... Okay, for a second I just got a little nervous.
[09:11.81]Because a bunch of people would... Caution!
[09:17.49]Why are there so many warnings?
[09:18.65]When using insecticide, you should not only read the directions, but you should also follow them carefully.
[09:28.28]That was a couple of... scary moments there.
[09:31.34]Alright.
[09:34.32]Mr. Mosquito, the Yamada's Summer...
[09:40.64]Loud birds.
[09:41.42]Are you ready?
[09:47.89]Welcome to the home of the Yamada family.
[09:50.99]It's summer.
[09:54.35]Do you like summer?
[09:55.57]That cat just fighting on the roof?
[09:56.99]Summer drives people crazy.
[09:59.00]And that makes them commit terrible acts.
[10:03.64]What?
[10:04.44]Take the tiny harmless mosquito, for example.
[10:09.24]It doesn't have enough time to do much during its one precious short life.
[10:16.20]Yet with one swipe, a human can snatch such a priceless life away without a second thought.
[10:25.40]I am sure that you may already realize that you are a mosquito.
[10:32.49]The insect that bites people and makes them feel itchy.
[10:38.19]The insect that creates a trail of swollen bites.
[10:43.71]As a mosquito, there is something that you naturally have to do.
[10:48.41]You have to suck blood.
[10:52.46]You must suck and store away as much human blood as possible in order to survive the winter and see another spring.
[11:05.20]However, blood sucking is accompanied with much danger.
[11:09.64]I'm sure it is.
[11:11.18]It may come as a surprise to you, but you're not welcome in the Yamada family home.
[11:17.57]She's been talking for a full day.
[11:21.25]Because you make people feel itchy.
[11:25.31]Bear in mind that they will go to great lengths to protect themselves from you.
[11:32.80]Is that a person just yelling or is that a crow?
[11:40.86]What the hell is that?
[11:42.85]Oh, that's me.
[11:43.43]That's Mr. Mosquito.
[11:47.97]Mosquito spread disease.
[11:52.35]Yeah, they just bite, suck blood, reproduce, hurt you, hurt your family.
[11:58.81]Start stage briefing for the next stage.
[12:00.91]Change mosquito color.
[12:02.21]I want to get a color scheme.
[12:04.11]You still only have one color.
[12:05.33]You have to win battles within the battle time attack set.
[12:11.67]This is a mosquito?
[12:15.21]This looks like a woodpecker.
[12:19.28]Okay.
[12:20.90]Stage.
[12:22.36]This is Rina's room.
[12:25.04]Rina is the daughter of the Yamada family.
[12:28.93]Okay.
[12:29.09]So this is-
[12:55.53]How do I play?
[12:56.25]Move over, Dad.
[12:58.07]You're too close to me.
[13:00.23]It's so hot today.
[13:06.09]Are they looking at me?
[13:06.95]It's about time over here to take a family picture.
[13:09.79]I've been looking forward to it.
[13:13.23]How about taking a picture of just you and Dad?
[13:15.16]I don't want to be in it.
[13:17.70]What are you talking about?
[13:19.20]Why not?
[13:20.69]Why are they all looking at me?
[13:21.41]Are they lying down or are they leaning in?
[13:24.11]Are they lying down in like a triangle?
[13:26.80]With their heads together?
[13:48.12]It's because of me, isn't it?
[13:49.80]You don't want to be in the photo with me, do you?
[13:51.98]There's the crow.
[14:01.58]I want nothing to do with this.
[14:03.00]I'm going to my room.
[14:07.98]I'm so confused.
[14:09.46]Okay, so they've spread out.
[14:28.69]You've ruined another family gathering.
[14:30.95]Not yet.
[14:33.37]So there's bug spray in parts of the room.
[14:40.06]So that's me.
[14:44.96]I'm huge!
[14:47.12]If a mosquito was that big, I'm getting a baseball bat.
[14:50.06]And I will tear off drywall from my walls to get rid of that thing.
[14:53.67]This is like a killer bee.
[15:00.06]Stage 1.
[15:02.28]I need to get two tanks of blood.
[15:05.60]There is one EX... What?
[15:08.13]I don't even know how to fly!
[15:12.41]There's no... The game didn't teach me anything.
[15:18.65]L... R1?
[15:19.41]Okay, R1 is fly.
[15:22.51]L1 is stop.
[15:24.73]Read the manual?
[15:25.43]God damn it.
[15:33.56]Getting started.
[15:34.67]Ouch.
[15:37.05]Set up your PlayStation 2 controllers.
[15:40.95]Okay, ouch.
[15:41.37]Okay.
[15:59.17]About insecticides.
[16:00.37]God damn it, I forgot you had to read this shit.
[16:02.79]Back to Seaman again.
[16:06.84]When using insecticide in real life, be sure to refer to the manufacturer's instructions.
[16:10.50]Why are they so concerned about that?
[16:14.26]Do people just like... Okay, here we go.
[16:18.19]Rear view.
[16:18.91]Okay, 180... R2 is 180 degree turn.
[16:22.49]R1 is accelerate.
[16:23.85]L1 is decelerate in reverse.
[16:27.66]Triangle is change camera angle and take off.
[16:31.51]I'm just gonna have this right here.
[16:34.37]Circle is attack and stabilize.
[16:37.71]X button is take off.
[16:39.69]Square is take off.
[16:42.63]So R1, L1.
[16:46.18]And then circle.
[16:49.64]Who fucking cares?
[16:58.40]Can you see me?
[17:18.27]Did I get crashed into her face?
[17:20.71]What?
[17:23.63]Attack all the points?
[17:24.99]What?
[17:26.35]I can turn the lights off?
[17:34.06]I don't understand.
[17:39.09]Why does she sound like she weighs 5,000 pounds?
[17:48.72]Why are we having a battle?
[17:51.94]How do I attack?
[18:03.31]Bite!
[18:05.17]Bite it!
[18:07.81]A circle is supposed to be attack.
[18:17.94]Okay.
[18:26.76]Attack and stabilize.
[18:29.53]accelerate select is not used menu controls mosquito alright listen push the left analog stick to point the view yeah yeah yeah press r1 to speed up l1 to slow down press l1 to button when stationary to reverse move around yeah okay press the r2 button to perform 180s
[18:52.28]lock on a red frame highlights relax points blood sucking points and gimmicks in the room with the left analog stick align the green lock on cursor with the red frames to lock on press the circle button to attack a locked on target so I can't just do it anywhere press the circle button to alleviate temporary loss of control when you crash into walls
[19:22.51]To suck blood faster, rotate the right analog stick faster.
[19:24.95]To suck slower, rotate slower.
[19:27.01]Jesus Christ.
[19:59.74]Just redo it.
[20:01.39]I'm not done.
[20:07.07]So, slowly stealth, I'm gonna turn the lights off.
[20:12.03]So I'm gonna kill the lights, so that she can't see.
[20:21.00]And then it's R3...
[20:34.03]Okay, I'm ready.
[20:34.81]We're gonna hit the lights.
[20:47.88]Suck the lightbulb.
[20:49.04]No, I'm gonna get, like, lightbulb juice in me.
[20:54.44]Okay, now that I've had to read the instructional manual... Let's turn the lights off.
[21:05.80]Okay, here we go.
[21:06.32]I'm gonna be careful.
[21:09.36]So get the cursor in there, lock on.
[21:11.42]It's locked on, let's decelerate.
[21:20.79]I can't see anything though.
[21:21.87]This is bad for me.
[21:28.17]What did I just run into?
[21:46.63]What's the point of turning- Okay, I see it.
[21:59.93]Why would you just- Okay, why would you sleep with the lights on?
[22:01.84]Keep the ball in the blue.
[22:20.92]This is a lot.
[22:29.10]Area of the meter you can press... What did that say?
[22:31.61]How much blood am I gonna take?
[22:37.83]Okay, two tanks.
[22:40.91]Okay, let's go.
[22:47.20]How was it the first time I hope you enjoyed your first bloodsuck Take all of it What what Jesus Christ
[23:12.50]This is not a porn game.
[23:14.62]Guys, the back of the box, I'm going to read this to you.

[23:32.74]There's somebody in a tub on the back of this, though.
[23:45.96]Is this... is this Comic Mischief?
[23:49.44]I don't have any clothes on, I gotta be careful here.
[23:56.06]This is... that's on the back... that's on the back of the box.

[24:10.97]This is the Yamada's storeroom.
[24:14.27]Rina's mother, Kaneo, is looking for their family albums.
[24:19.48]We saw you?
[24:20.10]The storeroom is full of toxic clothing and pesticide.
[24:23.28]Shut up.
[24:24.82]Try to avoid the toxic air as you fly around.
[24:28.34]No, you didn't.
[24:33.83]Reflection.
[24:38.52]No, you, no, you did not.
[24:42.38]Look.
[24:43.52]No, this, how would it reflect off a PlayStation case?
[24:47.82]Not possible.
[24:51.84]It reflected off itself.
[24:53.38]There's no way you guys saw anything.
[24:55.02]Nice chest hair.
[25:00.82]Let's see, I'm covered in chest hair.
[25:06.30]Ow, I feel so itchy.
[25:08.72]That's odd, because I had some bug repellent on.
[25:11.46]I'm covered in chest hair.
[25:12.34]Rub some aloe vera on it.
[25:14.10]It's on my legs, I got chest hair on my back.
[25:15.91]No way, it makes me feel sick.
[25:18.69]Don't be so silly, aloe works.
[25:23.65]Where were you bitten?
[25:27.25]It wasn't here, was it?
[25:30.99]I don't know.
[25:32.69]But if there's a mosquito here, you'll be next.
[25:36.25]You must be kidding.
[25:38.51]Why do all these... I don't understand this whole heads in frame thing.
[25:44.38]What are you looking for?
[25:51.90]Get fucked, Jerma.
[25:52.94]You actually got me there.
[26:07.26]No, you don't have to lip-sync any animations, that's true.
[26:09.98]Alright, you got your T-pose.
[26:18.79]Why is this so scary?
[26:21.23]Stage 2.
[26:21.87]Look out for the poison in the air.
[26:23.43]Suck two tanks of blood.
[26:26.35]Well, Jesus!
[26:27.65]What have we got for a spot?
[26:36.18]Ow.
[26:38.50]Okay, easy.
[26:41.80]You don't have any, like, points of interest.
[26:44.50]Right here?
[26:45.30]Battle.
[26:46.22]What?
[27:04.00]What did I just do?
[27:06.05]I don't understand.
[27:06.85]I had to hit you in the stomach?
[27:19.63]I gotta hit you right in the forehead.
[27:21.87]Alright, I can't go up that high.
[27:23.45]I have to hit you in a bunch of pressure points.
[27:30.48]Oh, this is so dumb.
[27:36.09]Watch out for the poison.
[27:36.95]I- it's a- I- Got ya, headshot.
[27:40.25]Now what?
[27:40.67]What the fuck is going on?
[28:11.42]Where am I supposed to bite?
[28:12.62]I don't see any marker.
[28:16.68]There's no red marker.
[28:18.19]Down there.
[28:18.61]Got it.
[28:23.87]You idiot.
[28:24.79]How did I fuck that up?
[28:27.45]What?
[28:29.05]I pressed the button!
[28:47.98]Where did that marker go?
[29:00.75]Hello?
[29:01.59]What?
[29:02.35]Okay.
[29:04.81]Why can I not do this?
[29:07.53]Is it on the other leg?
[29:08.54]Oh my god.
[29:13.70]This isn't it.
[29:21.16]Why?
[29:24.04]Which leg is this?
[29:26.32]It's not this one.
[29:27.08]Okay, I have another opportunity, apparently.
[29:40.73]No, I don't.
[29:44.07]Dude, what?
[29:48.43]Got it.
[29:54.84]What am I, two?
[30:02.62]Lady, by the way, I don't think you should be in a closed off room with a bunch of poison in it.
[30:09.54]Get out of here!
[30:12.69]You're breathing in all these fumes!
[30:31.64]Remember always try to keep things tidy this lady is breathing in just raid Ah at the last
[30:53.10]This is a nice porn game.
[30:54.14]It's not a porn game.
[30:58.54]Porn game.
[31:02.20]Yes, it is.
[31:02.80]This is not porn game.
[31:04.98]It's not a porn game.
[31:07.00]This is not porn.
[31:08.86]Stop this.
[31:10.48]You're making me self-conscious.
[31:13.50]This is the living room.
[31:15.93]Kenichi, the mainstay of the Yamada family, is watching TV.
[31:21.99]Having been warned of the mosquito by his wife and daughter, Kenichi has sprayed bug repellent.
[31:29.15]He has also told his family to cover themselves in bug repellent.
[31:34.25]Don't worry, though.
[31:35.97]Based on your actions, you will have plenty of chances to suck his blood.
[31:50.51]We're just going to play this game.
[31:52.01]This game was like $75.
[31:52.57]Okay.
[31:53.15]I'm wasting a lot of money on these PlayStation 2 porn games, okay?
[31:56.32]Okay.
[32:15.06]It wasn't $75, it was like $50.
[32:16.72]Hey, is he working out at the gym?
[32:22.56]It's a good gym playlist.
[32:23.84]Ugh.
[32:24.04]Really?
[32:46.46]The default cartoon Tom and Jerry sound effects.
[32:57.05]The horn.
[32:58.23]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[32:59.23]I'm losing my mind.
[33:00.91]I gotta stay focused.
[33:11.96]Okay.
[33:12.84]What are you watching?
[33:15.60]That's what was coming out of the TV.
[33:18.96]What a wacky weather report.
[33:21.96]Be careful of the air current coming from the air conditioner.
[33:24.56]Suck three tanks of blood this time.
[33:27.26]Right from the top of his head.
[33:28.22]Let's get in there.
[33:33.38]Did he just punch himself in the face?
[33:46.99]Stay focused.
[33:51.03]Fuck.
[33:51.93]Okay.
[33:55.47]Here it is.
[33:58.79]Got it.
[34:00.11]Three pints of blood.
[34:05.22]Whoa!
[34:06.94]What?
[34:09.60]He just instantly killed me.
[34:10.78]Good luck.
[34:16.86]Why did I just instantly die?
[34:34.05]You didn't do the... You didn't counter it.
[34:39.78]Alright, so... Wait for him to punch himself in the face.
[34:45.31]After he punches himself in the face.
[34:50.70]This is freaking me out.
[34:58.00]I got it.
[34:58.54]Telephone call.
[35:00.14]Distraction.
[35:04.44]He's gonna get up and answer the phone.
[35:17.94]It's in there.
[35:19.44]Come on!
[35:21.06]Come on!
[35:22.56]Come on!
[35:23.88]What?
[35:24.78]Why?
[35:29.49]Why couldn't I do that?
[35:34.61]Alright, wait till he punches himself in the face.
[35:40.91]Just wait.
[35:41.31]He punches himself right in the mouth.
[35:46.45]This isn't it.
[35:49.40]Here it comes.
[35:52.56]Oh, okay.
[35:53.54]Punch in the face.
[35:54.82]And... What's wrong with me?
[36:07.00]What's going on?
[36:07.42]What?! !
[36:19.68]Okay, maybe not the head.
[36:21.88]Maybe it's somewhere else.
[36:30.30]My stress levels... Their stress levels are too high.
[36:37.41]He can hear you.
[36:43.41]That's his stress level.
[36:45.19]Alright, so we gotta get in there quick.
[36:56.61]He goes, I'm bored.
[36:58.49]We've got to get in there.
[36:59.79]Air current coming from the air... Yeah, that doesn't seem like it matters.
[37:03.99]Here we go.
[37:08.83]His stress is fine.
[37:10.39]Get in there.
[37:11.31]He's bored.
[37:15.98]Stress is alright.
[37:16.72]Easy.
[37:19.80]Easy.
[37:25.40]Where's that indicator?
[37:26.10]Come on.
[37:29.43]It was just here.
[37:31.19]Where is it?
[37:35.77]Oh my fucking god.
[37:48.07]Is there anywhere else I can bite him?
[37:50.77]Maybe the head is just not the one to do.
[37:52.13]Can I get him in like the foot?
[37:54.11]Or in like the ankle or something?
[38:04.89]I think I have to distract him.
[38:06.05]Let me see.
[38:13.87]Oh, I'm gonna change the channel on him.
[38:15.00]He's gonna get really mad about this.
[38:22.12]Turn that strange?
[38:29.44]Okay, I'm high enough where I should really get an indicator here.
[38:32.02]There it is.
[38:36.33]Damn it.
[38:43.63]Stress is fine.
[38:47.49]Come on, give me the indicator.
[38:48.39]Give it to me!
[38:51.05]What are you doing?
[38:55.51]What?
[38:57.84]There it is.
[38:58.24]Okay, hold on.
[39:00.12]He's stressed.
[39:01.14]I'm going to back up.
[39:10.87]I'm going for it from here Check it out Got it Watch that stress level How many?
[39:29.88]Three?
[39:32.14]I'm not gonna get all three right now
[39:43.47]Don't do it!
[39:45.27]What's his level like?
[39:46.83]He's getting a little stressed, I'm gonna back off.
[39:49.45]Yeah, I'm backing off, I'm backing off.
[39:59.32]I'm gonna turn the phone on.
[40:00.82]So he... Oh shit, he just turned on the AC.
[40:08.75]He turned on the air conditioner somehow.
[40:14.74]Where's the AC come from?
[40:15.60]Not gonna see me, right?
[40:22.38]I can't get it from here.
[40:23.10]My AC's off.
[40:28.10]Let's get it.
[40:29.42]What?
[40:29.64]Ow.
[40:29.72]Here we go.
[40:41.80]Same deal.
[40:42.38]Far away.
[40:42.86]His stress level should be good and manageable.
[40:46.90]And three, two, one.
[40:48.92]Blast off.
[40:50.92]He's good.
[40:51.34]Give me one more.
[40:54.92]And then Tutorial Dad is done.
[41:07.21]They get more stressed if you don't keep it in the blue.
[41:11.62]Don't swap me, please.
[41:13.06]Thank god.
[41:13.44]Alright, get up.
[41:13.98]That was loud.
[41:48.65]I did it.
[41:49.09]Can I change my... No, I only have one color.
[41:54.27]This time you are in the bathroom.
[41:56.61]Rina is taking a bath, and so her blood circulation is good.
[42:00.69]She hasn't got any bug repellent sprayed on, and so this is an incredibly good blood-sucking opportunity for you.
[42:07.37]There is something that you should be careful of.
[42:09.69]If you suck too much blood, you will become heavier, and so flying will become more difficult.
[42:14.98]Okay.
[42:26.48]How do I, hold on.
[42:42.43]I'm just trying to get something ready here, just in case I need it.
[42:50.05]Raina, it's time for your bath.
[42:53.37]I don't think I can, um...
[43:23.33]We'll just have to see.
[43:30.99]It's alright.
[43:36.25]It's... This feels so good.
[43:38.34]I can't see.
[43:53.62]Let's make this quick.
[43:54.84]Get out!
[44:00.08]Out!
[44:00.70]Out!
[44:24.57]Alright, we're fine It's all, like, blurred out Don't look over here
[44:59.21]I keep hitting them.
[44:59.87]Bubbles don't make those noises.
[45:01.45]Oh well.
[45:03.33]This feels so good.
[45:14.49]Fuck.
[45:30.51]Just let me get all three.
[45:37.19]I gotta get out.
[45:39.81]Why is everybody so bored?
[45:42.32]Give me this last one, then get out, out, out, get out, get out now.
[45:44.86]Nope!
[46:11.30]And when you pop a bubble, guys, it goes SNAP!
[46:13.64]Get out.
[46:53.59]Where is she?
[46:58.83]Oh.
[46:59.25]Who is it?
[47:25.67]Fuck you.
[47:34.94]I only have a minute left?
[47:35.94]Alright, no more jokes.
[47:41.03]You can't even see anything anyways.
[47:42.13]Who cares?
[47:42.59]I can't see anything at all.
[47:55.15]Right here.
[47:55.51]Come on.
[48:01.90]Who is it?
[48:02.92]Stop!
[48:04.26]29 seconds.
[48:05.78]Give me the indicator.
[48:06.52]Oh, well.
[48:07.42]It's just a floating hair.
[48:08.60]I'm so bored.
[48:16.67]I'm so bored.
[48:33.50]Looks so much worse.
[49:05.12]Kanao is preparing dinner in the kitchen.
[49:08.28]All of the family have been bitten by you now, so she has lit a mosquito coil.
[49:13.84]Do not go too close to the fumes from the mosquito coil.
[49:18.48]Mosquitoes don't need that.
[49:25.48]Mosquitoes don't drink water.
[49:26.26]Mosquitoes don't drink water, they drink blood.
[49:28.14]There's water in blood.
[49:43.31]You promised that you'd come home on time.
[49:45.32]I shouldn't... Don't read chat right now.
[49:48.38]Yeah.
[49:49.68]I know.
[49:50.16]No one has to come home at five nowadays.
[49:52.76]This is how I feel.
[49:54.08]Yeah, I'm here too.
[49:54.68]This is how I feel reading chat right now.
[49:57.71]When I was young.
[50:01.25]Okay, I get it.
[50:06.97]I don't see the harm in making it a little later.
[50:12.17]I've had enough of all this.
[50:14.93]I think that there is a mosquito in the house.
[50:17.91]You think?
[50:20.09]Go and buy some insecticide, Kaneo, and make sure it works.
[50:25.10]No way that you could go and buy some yourself.
[50:32.72]Mom, weren't you going to cook dinner now?
[50:36.56]I'd like to eat potato cakes tonight.
[50:40.26]Really?
[50:43.41]Really?
[50:43.99]Ugh.
[51:24.00]Nobody knew what they were saying.
[51:26.36]That's weird.
[51:34.04]What happened to my stream labs?
[51:37.24]Dashboard!
[51:37.88]There it is, okay.
[51:43.57]Alright, cooking.
[51:47.03]Wow.
[51:49.83]This mother is insane.
[51:59.53]That was four or five front flips.
[52:02.21]Without touching any of the shit.
[52:04.85]Stay away from the mosquito coil fumes, there are two blo- okay.
[52:08.55]What did that even say?
[52:13.82]The mom is a god gamer.
[52:17.04]Is that a god gamer?
[52:21.20]Or is- what do you mean, god gamer?
[52:22.78]Okay, I gotta get both, uh, knees?
[52:28.64]She did a front flip.
[52:29.48]What does that have to do with gaming?
[52:33.66]Come on.
[52:36.46]Let's see it.
[52:40.66]It's right when she goes to the front of the sink.
[52:45.01]Hold on.
[52:45.29]Can I, like, distract her with something?
[52:46.85]Can I fuck with the hot dogs?
[52:52.89]Only a god gamer could... Alright, it's... Alright, I have to get the feet.
[52:58.06]So it's both feet.
[53:00.52]I'm gonna get killed here.
[53:05.00]Alright, here we go.
[53:21.27]How long does she do this for?
[53:30.00]She's eventually gonna stop doing this pose.
[53:34.82]Why would you do this pose for this long?
[53:36.62]There's no way.
[53:50.51]You still going?
[53:51.13]Alright, there we go.
[53:51.75]Here we go.
[53:53.69]Let's do the other one this time.
[54:07.91]Actually no, we'll just do this one again.
[54:18.65]They even feel it.
[54:19.33]They go, ow.
[54:28.07]That's it?
[54:37.50]Now what?
[54:39.50]What was the briefing?
[54:40.46]How many do I need?
[54:41.06]Oh shit, careful.
[54:44.86]It's smoky.
[54:49.32]Oh, the other one.
[54:49.92]Okay.
[54:50.12]That shouldn't be too hard.
[55:02.93]Right there.
[55:05.57]Really?
[55:06.27]God damn it.
[55:06.83]Alright, it's... I can get it.
[55:10.93]What?
[55:13.33]I gotta go from the top.
[55:14.35]Uh-oh.
[55:15.23]Bad news.
[55:19.95]I need two more.
[55:27.02]Oh!
[55:27.08]So I gotta go right in front.
[55:28.32]From the top down.
[55:29.58]Uh, I don't... What?
[55:44.16]Why?
[55:47.07]It's smoky.
[55:52.59]How did I fail that?
[56:02.19]This is not a porn game!
[56:04.21]Do I get an indicator of when she's gonna move?
[56:25.63]One more.
[56:27.53]Got it.
[56:28.45]You're a degenerate.
[56:57.28]Why is she doing this twice?
[57:09.71]Did she get hurt?
[57:10.43]Did she fall down?
[57:14.00]What are we implying here?
[57:15.60]That she did a couple backflips or frontflips and landed on her head?
[57:22.06]Now I feel guilty?
[57:23.54]Is that what that was?
[57:27.58]Alright.
[57:29.04]Rina's room.
[57:31.50]Rina is becoming extremely wary of you.
[57:35.30]She is armed with an insecticide spray.
[57:37.82]She's armed with an insecticide.
[57:38.78]What's more, she also has a bug zapper.
[57:41.58]Oh, great.
[57:42.94]Be careful.
[57:48.24]So now they have weapons.
[57:50.76]It's so itchy.
[57:52.36]Are you okay?
[57:54.04]The potato cakes are ruined.
[57:56.82]Did she just say that?
[58:23.04]A wolf?
[58:23.24]A pack of wolves just walked by the house, no big deal.
[58:29.48]Alright.
[58:59.90]So we're in her room.
[59:03.32]She has bug spray and a zapper.
[59:18.98]Is she screaming that?
[59:21.18]The cuckoo clock?
[59:31.54]Okay, that's VR game level... of involvement there.
[59:37.83]What's with this posture?
[59:47.94]What?
[59:48.84]Alright, wait, easy!
[59:50.50]You just turned this into a lot more difficult for me.
[59:57.55]I made a lot of... Let me get the bug zapper.
[60:01.99]And then... Alright, where am I supposed to bite?
[60:08.87]Do you see it?
[60:09.97]The neck, maybe?
[60:10.77]Phone?
[60:13.79]Turn off?
[60:14.19]Okay, let me turn the... Let me turn it off.
[60:20.74]What?
[60:23.68]What have we got?
[60:27.13]What am I supposed to get?
[60:32.97]Oh, it's that.
[60:33.75]That's a good... How is this... I thought that was a toaster.
[60:37.45]Let's see what we can do here.
[60:41.55]The leg?
[60:42.07]I don't see anything.
[60:44.72]It's probably arm?
[60:45.64]Neck?
[60:46.54]Face?
[60:46.84]Watch out.
[60:57.70]Shoulder?
[60:58.64]Oh, she hit me.
[61:00.54]I don't have any idea.
[61:02.18]Answer the phone?
[61:24.92]Got it.
[61:28.46]Wait, who called her?
[61:30.42]She's pretending to answer the phone.
[61:31.82]I just called.
[61:32.60]I just hit the button.
[61:37.57]There's nobody on that phone.
[61:43.07]Okay, so I called somebody else and then she's acting... I don't understand that.
[62:01.40]I'm gonna still be in here, right?
[62:09.28]You want your handcuff on up?
[62:23.26]Yeah, what kind of conversation was that?
[62:24.28]Was she, like, taking a delivery order?
[62:28.07]I'll take a sausage and onion.
[62:29.65]Yes, okay.
[62:31.12]And I'll also take a side of french fries, too.
[62:33.64]Oh, yes, okay.
[62:34.22]And I also want an italian chop.
[62:38.63]Yes, okay.
[62:50.99]Oh, can you mash up a mosquito and grind it up and put it in the fucking smoothie for me?
[62:55.44]I gotta get out.
[62:56.16]Okay, there we go.
[63:12.59]Just have to keep doing this.
[63:21.07]Yeah, this is rocky music.
[63:29.27]Fuck.
[63:29.73]I gotta go back further.
[63:40.66]Risky.
[63:41.64]Too risky, too risky out.
[63:43.90]I gotta try for another spot.
[63:56.42]Maybe I can just get it without... Nah, I definitely have to do it.
[63:58.56]Anything else in the room I can do?
[63:59.50]I can turn the lights off, but that sucks.
[64:02.94]I'll try it.
[64:04.74]She's just entertaining herself.
[64:11.91]You already got over here?
[64:18.83]Oh no.
[64:24.93]No, phone is definitely the best tactic.
[64:27.41]Let's go further up.
[64:33.64]No!
[64:33.74]Just keep calling her.
[64:56.83]At what point would you really... What about... Can I do something on the other side?
[65:03.24]What about, like, here?
[65:04.42]Right on the shoulder.
[65:07.14]Come on.
[65:07.50]That wasn't the shoulder.
[65:08.28]God damn it.
[65:14.70]Hiya!
[65:28.61]Fuck!
[65:28.87]This one's hard!
[65:35.69]She's stressed, but I gotta do it!
[65:40.21]Ow!
[65:40.31]Alright, we're fine.
[66:00.67]Ugh.
[66:03.81]I wonder if this will work better, too.
[66:04.97]Let me try this.
[66:05.69]Like, can I do it from here, too?
[66:08.65]Let me see.
[66:11.01]In the shoulder?
[66:14.57]What?
[66:15.10]No.
[66:15.72]It's only phone?
[66:19.52]How is phone the only thing... It has to be the phone.
[66:25.44]Middle punch!
[66:32.61]Turn off the TV?
[66:33.21]I don't think I can.
[66:33.81]This is the only way this is gonna work.
[66:41.00]It's risky, but I gotta do it.
[66:47.70]Gimme one, gimme one, gimme one, gimme gimmie gimmie.
[66:49.00]Out.
[66:50.00]Whoa I just barely missed it. No I'm- aw no. Get out.
[66:56.00]Quick, turn off the lights.
[67:03.74]Okay, she can't reach this height.
[67:08.38]Holy shit, she has the spray!
[67:13.49]What did I just do?
[67:16.41]Right in the chest.
[67:18.17]Like, right in the heart.
[67:31.66]She just counter-punched me.
[67:33.84]Holy shit.
[67:35.18]You gotta be kidding me.
[67:36.06]And she's gonna spray me!
[67:40.22]Did it work?
[67:42.00]I gotta get her in like a knee, I think.
[67:50.19]One more spot, right?
[67:50.87]I think right in the knee.
[67:53.35]Where is it?
[67:56.57]Where is it?
[67:57.04]Where's this last spot?
[68:05.10]Okay, behind her.
[68:07.24]Damn it!
[68:08.66]I got it.
[68:11.13]Wait.
[68:13.19]Oh, that's the phone.
[68:16.93]Alright, saved it.
[68:40.46]I can't do it anymore.
[68:41.12]I gotta do the shoulder.
[68:43.78]Oh my god, no way.
[68:46.22]I can't do the neck anymore.
[68:47.72]I gotta do the shoulder.
[68:52.17]But how am I gonna... Middle punch!
[69:02.49]Yeah!
[69:08.75]Oh, come on!
[69:10.45]Holy shit!
[69:14.95]Why?
[69:16.25]Jesus!
[69:17.59]That went quick.
[69:21.31]Oh my god.
[69:24.45]I'm gonna die.
[69:38.79]No, I still have hearts.
[69:39.51]This is right.
[69:45.14]I didn't get it.
[69:48.36]Oh no, this is bad.
[69:50.86]Why can't I turn around?
[69:54.02]Turn around!
[70:01.73]One.
[70:04.67]One behind, too.
[70:10.46]I gotta do the Star Fox turn around and go right... like this.
[70:16.17]Nope, didn't get it.
[70:23.11]This is so hard.
[70:28.93]Damn it!
[70:31.51]No!
[70:33.09]No!
[70:35.41]Snake, there are only 20 seconds left.
[70:41.05]I gotta wait till she takes the can out.
[70:53.28]Okay, can's out.
[70:57.06]Now I can get the arm.
[71:01.08]Holy shit.
[71:05.38]Get it!
[71:11.26]No, I didn't get that!
[71:24.29]I'm right here!
[71:30.42]Alright.
[71:32.62]So I can only do the top of the finger for three or four seconds.
[71:40.05]Um, game, what the hell, why?
[71:43.23]Okay, almost.
[72:08.48]That's it.
[72:08.82]There's the hang-up.
[72:19.16]Got it.
[72:19.70]Do it.
[72:27.88]Hit the phone.
[72:29.54]You should do it.
[72:42.08]I gotta do another one?
[72:44.94]What's the other one?
[72:45.88]I don't even know.
[72:58.12]Where is it?
[73:09.64]Is it the hand again?
[73:10.54]No, it's the hand again!
[73:11.50]Try something besides phone?
[73:21.57]I did the stereo, and that didn't do anything.
[73:26.01]I couldn't bite her anywhere.
[73:29.55]It's the hand again.
[73:41.49]Okay, talk to you soon, Michi.
[73:43.39]Here it comes.
[73:58.35]Check on the pillow.
[73:59.11]I don't see an indicator.
[74:04.28]The only indicator is... I'm just gonna do this.
[74:06.00]The only indicator is the phone and the stereo.
[74:15.36]Shit.
[74:18.22]Not good.
[74:19.06]Don't risk it, don't risk it, don't risk it, don't risk it!
[74:29.93]Yeah, there's nothing else in here.
[74:36.09]I can't, like, mess around with something on the table, nothing in the trash.
[74:41.49]Stereo's the only... I can't even press the stereo again, but she just kind of kneels down for a second.
[74:45.62]This tactic is working.
[74:52.18]This'll be it.
[74:53.34]That's it.
[74:57.16]Close it up.
[74:57.99]Got it.
[75:02.55]That was 15 minutes?!
[75:04.07]Holy shit.
[75:10.72]I'm dumb and blame games.
[75:12.08]What are you talking about?
[75:13.98]There were only two things to activate in the room.
[75:30.99]What else could I have done besides the phone and the stereo?
[75:34.09]The TV didn't have an indicator on it.
[75:37.49]This is the Japanese room where Kenichi likes to amuse himself with flower arranging.
[75:43.97]He suspects that the bites you gave him were due to a tick, and so he has covered the Japanese floor mats with insecticide.
[75:52.94]You will therefore be hurt if you land on the mats.
[75:55.80]Don't touch anything.
[75:56.80]Needless to say, you cannot suck blood from Kenichi's feet.
[76:01.62]And one more point of caution.
[76:04.14]Stay away from the airflow from the air conditioner.
[76:12.62]Avoid everything.
[76:16.14]Yeah, no feet.
[76:16.96]Not this time.
[76:17.68]What are you doing?
[76:18.44]I was just practicing.
[76:20.84]It's so itchy.
[76:22.96]I've got another bite.
[76:25.20]Stop all hobbies that cause injuries.
[76:27.58]Huh?
[76:28.74]Flower arranging is the spirit of Japan.
[76:31.61]What do you think, Reina?
[76:32.89]Would you like to try it?
[76:34.01]No way.
[76:36.91]Genichi, I covered tatami mats in the Japanese room with tick insecticide.
[76:44.15]Why is this guy wearing glasses with no lenses?
[76:46.21]I don't know.
[76:46.91]That's a good question.
[77:13.00]Who names their room the Japanese room?
[77:18.27]I don't know.
[77:18.85]Alright.
[77:22.71]Don't touch anything.
[77:31.24]This is going to be difficult.
[77:32.10]How am I going to get in here?
[77:36.32]Why is he just staring at this?
[77:37.40]What's going on?
[77:42.58]Is this like meditation or something?
[77:48.37]Stay away from the floor mats and mosquito coil fumes.
[77:55.51]Okay, so we can't do that.
[77:59.02]So we have to stay away from the fumes.
[78:01.98]Let's see, I can't do anything there.
[78:07.00]What's... He's breathing in the fumes?
[78:10.22]Oh, shit.
[78:10.86]Okay, this is... I'm, like, trapped in here.
[78:13.90]Alright, let's... What do we got?
[78:18.05]Any... What points of interest?
[78:19.13]Okay, on his back?
[78:20.55]That's his back.
[78:21.05]That might be his chest.
[78:26.03]I think it might be his chest.
[78:34.06]Hmm.
[78:39.92]Nothing over there.
[78:40.64]I can't, like, touch anything there.
[78:42.68]Is he hurt with thorns?
[78:51.01]Don't fight him in the eye?
[78:54.33]No.
[78:55.27]What over here?
[78:55.75]Can I activate this?
[79:00.89]Nothing I can activate.
[79:07.93]There's no buttons to press.
[79:08.89]A little behind me?
[79:12.33]Can I turn the light off?
[79:13.09]Yeah, I have no idea what this guy's doing.
[79:18.69]He's like grabbing... I have to bite him in the mouth.
[79:25.37]Do I have to bite him in the lips?
[79:34.58]I don't understand.
[79:37.73]There were no points to attack him.
[79:53.77]I don't think I... I might have to just sneak around when he's trying to put the flower in?
[79:59.01]I'm almost dead.
[80:03.88]I exploded.
[80:04.56]Okay.
[80:09.86]What happened at the end there?
[80:16.23]I just got aquatined.
[80:19.81]Doesn't Master Shake do that to everybody?
[80:22.29]After, like, season three?
[80:48.97]It was his chest.
[80:49.91]It was somewhere in his stomach.
[81:01.34]Is it his stomach or his back?
[81:05.02]Don't touch the floor.
[81:05.86]Don't touch the fumes.
[81:07.12]Need... There are two points.
[81:12.05]Maybe can I go through?
[81:13.41]What about the... Alright.
[81:15.97]I don't even know where the game even... Maybe I can fly through his legs.
[81:23.75]This might be finesse.
[81:27.91]This is how you sell stressed out.
[81:29.73]I thought maybe I could go through his legs.
[81:54.65]Rage Quit?
[81:55.87]No, I'm just... It's faster for me to reload.
[82:07.54]Next game?
[82:08.12]No.
[82:10.92]The next game is Jerm of Slots.
[82:17.55]I want to play this for a little longer.
[82:18.87]That's what's gonna happen.
[82:22.27]I need to beat these people.
[82:41.34]I need to get to... I need to at least get to a point where I'm satisfied sucking all their blood.
[82:47.75]This game is a 15-hour game.
[82:49.27]I'm not going to play this game for 15 hours.
[82:54.35]It's been like an hour and like 15 minutes.
[83:03.06]Alright, that's... Alright, give me an indicator.
[83:13.43]Okay, how am I supposed to...
[83:17.16]It feels like you can't avoid any of that stuff.
[83:18.62]It's hot.
[83:24.12]Alright, what is that?
[83:26.04]When he says, it's hot.
[83:27.56]He goes, it's hot.
[83:30.27]Maybe this way.
[83:31.17]On the side?
[83:31.83]This game is only like 3 hours.
[83:35.27]It's not like 15 hours.
[83:37.63]Where are you getting the 15 hours from?
[83:40.13]There's 12 stages.
[83:41.35]So wait, why are people saying this is like a 10 hour game?
[83:48.13]Maybe this way.
[83:50.61]Waiting for an indicator.
[83:56.59]Nothing?
[84:00.61]It's hot.
[84:03.81]Right in the hand.
[84:05.97]How long does that last for though?
[84:12.29]Maybe this way.
[84:14.37]How much time do I have?
[84:16.55]That's like three or four seconds.
[84:25.90]Indicator's gone in his hand, though.
[84:30.16]He's starting to see me.
[84:34.24]He pricks his finger on the rose, but how come I didn't see it last time?
[84:40.03]I was just sitting there waiting for it.
[84:42.65]I can do his face, too!
[84:54.32]Maybe this way.
[84:58.38]Alright, here it is.
[85:02.88]My finger.
[85:04.34]And... No indicator.
[85:05.96]Only just... That's only on for two seconds.
[85:12.19]Maybe this way.
[85:16.29]Hmm...
[85:24.67]It's hot.
[85:28.13]I'm right on his lips.
[85:32.47]This should not be... I should not be able to do it like this.
[85:41.23]That's happened to me before, though.
[85:42.59]How often is a mosquito, like, flown into your mouth?
[85:46.25]And you go like... That happens, like, at least once or twice a season.
[85:52.50]It does...
[85:55.61]Let me get it all in one go.
[85:57.47]No!
[86:27.13]God damn it.
[86:29.89]Come on, right there.
[86:41.36]Right there.
[86:44.38]I didn't hit that.
[86:45.04]Come on.
[86:49.12]What is going on with this camera?
[86:53.40]One more.
[86:57.25]Is it on his back?
[86:58.59]Probably.
[86:58.91]It's probably, like, on his ass or something.
[87:01.54]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[87:12.09]I just need to do this, like, one more time.
[87:14.19]Right in his mouth.
[87:17.61]Alright, right in his mouth, same deal.
[87:22.58]Right in his lip.
[87:24.36]And we need one more.
[87:34.77]It's hot.
[87:41.24]That's it for that one.
[87:49.72]I need the other one now.
[87:52.43]What?
[87:52.71]Oh, come on.
[88:06.17]Didn't get it?
[88:09.07]Come on, it's right there!
[88:11.04]No!
[88:18.20]I'm gonna die from these fumes.
[88:20.76]I'm dead.
[88:22.86]I'm dead.
[88:24.09]God damn it.
[88:29.43]This level sucks.
[88:34.01]No, not next!
[88:34.83]No, I've gotta beat this guy!
[88:37.60]I have to beat this guy!
[88:38.84]The only thing is, where's the other... It's gotta be the hand, right?
[89:01.35]So it's his hand and his mouth.
[89:05.37]Sunk cost fallacy.
[89:06.47]Don't wait to talk about sunk cost fallacy before we get into a term of slots.
[89:23.79]Burning seven mosquito coils at the same time is roughly equivalent to burning 700 cigarettes.
[89:36.20]That's insane.
[89:37.98]Okay, now the question is, just... I'm not even near these coils.
[89:42.57]I need to do what I did before.
[89:43.57]Just get out.
[89:44.71]Sneak through here.
[89:45.35]Spin it around.
[89:47.89]Do the mouth again.
[89:49.51]Try to get... I'm gonna try to get all three of them.
[89:57.22]Alright, good.
[89:58.40]Okay.
[90:05.05]Right in the middle, right in the middle of the blue.
[90:06.61]Give me all three.
[90:10.33]And then how am I gonna get out of this?
[90:15.62]Fuck, it's going up so much faster.
[90:18.72]After I get out, what's the best way to leave?
[90:23.08]Through his shoulder?
[90:24.42]Whoa!
[90:25.10]Excuse me!
[90:38.66]Didn't get it.
[90:40.78]It's because of the wind?
[90:41.49]I don't understand what happened.
[90:48.03]That was going so well, and then it just... Insta-went horrible.
[90:53.09]That was in an instant.
[91:01.28]I'm dead.
[91:01.68]No, no, go!
[91:10.76]I don't understand what happened there, though.
[91:12.20]What was the problem?
[91:14.50]I did that last time for... Am I getting pissed?
[91:21.78]A little.
[91:22.84]Okay.
[91:52.51]I have to beat this guy.
[91:58.19]I got a new color?
[92:00.27]He's getting mad at a porn game.
[92:04.72]It's not a porn game.
[92:15.25]I'm gonna do it this time.
[92:17.64]That was bullshit though, last... What was that?
[92:20.42]Alright, I'm gonna try this one more time.
[92:42.46]do this one more time maybe this way it's hot
[93:10.35]He says, it's hot, I gotta get out.
[93:31.38]I did it just a couple more of those maybe this way I
[94:06.39]You stupid game.
[94:08.55]There's nothing even there.
[94:09.91]There's nothing even here!
[94:11.71]I'm getting hit by imaginary things!
[94:15.17]It wasn't even on!
[94:16.03]The air conditioner wasn't even turned on!
[94:20.31]Unbelievable.
[94:23.98]What are these hitboxes?
[94:25.50]What are these fucking gigantic hitboxes?
[94:27.26]I'm gonna die.
[94:28.54]And then I'm gonna break this disk in half.
[94:34.50]You gotta be kidding me.
[94:35.84]Maybe this way.
[94:38.46]Literally, he doesn't even... Why would I complain about a game that's like 15 years old that was developed and... It's just invisible shit.
[94:57.28]I'm gonna break the disk in half.
[94:59.88]This is the Japanese room.
[95:04.96]This is the Japanese... How much does this game cost?
[95:16.99]Uh, like, $60.
[95:18.17]Because it's rare.
[95:42.36]It's the stupid smoke things.
[95:45.39]You can't even see.
[95:47.33]There's no point in trying to explain myself.
[96:14.63]Okay.
[96:17.33]If I don't do it this time, we're moving on.
[96:19.97]This is seriously enraging.
[96:24.04]Oh my fucking god, he didn't even say anything!
[96:31.86]What the hell?
[96:32.63]I didn't- What?! !
[96:43.93]I'm just... I... If this... If it blows this way, I'm gonna fucking scream.
[97:01.38]Hmm...
[97:14.73]Now, I know the air conditioner is blowing the smoke, but the smoke has hitboxes that are like five times as big as its particle!
[97:21.22]That's what I'm saying!
[97:31.10]Oh my god!
[97:33.38]Just get... No, man!
[97:39.65]Give me a break!
[97:44.63]I didn't even do anything.
[97:46.35]He just decided to do it.
[97:48.73]I'm reselling that on eBay.
[98:00.69]It just went immediately right to Reddit.
[98:04.62]I want to watch that.
[98:05.70]I want to see it.
[98:06.14]I'm curious.
[98:06.88]I want to see what that looks like.
[98:08.94]I can't believe it.
[98:26.70]What happened here?
[98:29.59]Green.
[98:30.41]We're green.
[98:31.59]We're in the green.
[98:32.11]I'm perfectly in the blue.
[98:34.63]Perfectly in the blue.
[98:35.37]Now it's just red.
[98:36.21]Dev.
[98:56.18]Oh my god!
[98:57.02]I don't understand.
[99:01.64]That was a fun game though.
[99:12.47]Let's watch it together.
[99:21.67]blowing the smoke, but the smoke has hitboxes that are like five times as big as its particle.
[99:26.83]That's what I'm saying.
[99:30.35]Green.
[99:31.11]In the blue.
[99:31.83]Green in the blue.
[99:32.94]Green in the blue.
[99:34.00]Green.
[99:34.56]Green.
[99:35.20]Green.
[99:36.70]Oh my god!
[99:39.00]Just get... You had plenty of time.
[99:50.29]Why did you... What?
[99:52.34]It was red for like a half a second.
[100:00.73]There's plenty... Watch it again!
[100:03.27]I want you to watch it again.
[100:05.53]We're gonna... Blowing the smoke, but the smoke has hitboxes that are like five times as big as its particle.
[100:16.02]That's what I'm saying.
[100:21.88]16.
[100:21.96]It wasn't even a full second.
[100:30.42]Ready?
[100:31.42]17.
[100:34.64]Red, and by the way, look at it, it's off the screen.
[100:38.12]Now it's, okay, that was not even one second.
[100:43.94]That was like, maybe, 70% of a second.
[100:49.52]And there's no indicators of doing everything correctly.
[101:02.00]Your reaction, why would I assume, why would I think that that was gonna happen?
