[02:42.56]Now I gotta do something real quick.
[02:47.88]Real quickity quick.
[02:57.88]Get back to this page.
[03:06.36]So one more test for the new guys that just showed up.

[03:10.66]Because I feel like it's not.
[03:13.09]If it is, I'm totally wrong.
[03:14.27]If it isn't, then I screwed something up.
[03:16.77]But I think we might have a special guest referee.

[03:59.28]Oh, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:01.36]Special guest is... I'll let him introduce himself when he gets in here.
[04:08.28]What's up, man?
[04:11.65]Well, hold on, hold on.
[04:13.61]No one can hear anything you're saying because I have to change this.
[04:19.39]I built you up too.
[04:20.47]I was like, oh, and here he is, the special guest.
[04:22.94]And nobody can hear you.
[04:25.48]Now they can.
[04:27.44]Hello.
[04:28.66]It's Star, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:31.00]Oh my god, is it the real one?
[04:32.88]Or that fake imposter guy?
[04:34.34]I think it might be the fake one.
[04:36.39]It usually is.
[04:40.00]I literally just woke up, got out of bed, and I was like, oh, he's streaming.
[04:44.38]Okay.
[04:46.26]Yeah, yeah, I just decided to do it.
[04:48.94]You know, I didn't do it last night, so I tell myself I have to do it every week.
[04:55.01]That is a good goal.
[04:56.37]It's on your YouTube channel?
[05:00.05]Yeah.
[05:00.39]I don't see it.
[05:00.93]Or maybe I'm just dumb.
[05:02.98]It should be in feeds.
[05:05.04]Oh, yeah, that's... They, like, tuck it away there.
[05:07.88]Yeah, it's not, like, in, like, subscription boxes.
[05:10.04]It's in the feed, I think.
[05:13.44]I'm, like, shooting people on my own team.
[05:14.80]What am I doing?
[05:17.64]Uh, can you get in here?
[05:19.12]I will do that.
[05:19.84]I just... Is it possible?
[05:22.44]Yeah, one second.
[05:23.02]I was just, like, removing HUD elements, and I'll fix that up and come in.
[05:30.00]Somebody said, Star, I just want to let you know, you are the shit, Broseph.
[05:36.13]Oh, shit.
[05:39.03]I did not know that about myself.
[05:42.69]Well, you are.
[05:44.75]Nice Pyro.
[05:46.39]Good job.
[05:46.89]Good job, Pyro.
[05:50.56]Hi, Rizzle.
[05:55.48]No.
[05:55.82]No.
[05:57.53]Oh my god, run.
[05:59.13]Nothing I can do there.
[06:00.47]And now the plan is to jump.
[06:05.27]Oh, the rocket.
[06:06.89]I'm gonna use the rocket.
[06:08.47]And immediately get backstabbed again.
[06:26.55]server is full who to thunk who to thunk yeah my reserve slot I'm gonna have somebody in the sir oh god this might be bad I might have to kick a couple people only because my reserve slot doesn't work right now kick oh let me let me I'm just gonna ask if anyone's because I'm not gonna kick anyone unless they're willing
[06:59.82]Let's see if I can get maybe one or two people.
[07:03.96]Because I need two slots.
[07:10.41]I am that fat.
[07:19.99]Boom!
[07:22.74]Boom!
[07:23.08]Alright, let's see.
[07:24.44]Are you auto-joining?
[07:27.07]I'm spamming Join Game.
[07:28.32]Alright.
[07:38.56]I gotta get that set up.
[07:41.36]My, uh... There's a lot of things you need to get set up.
[07:48.94]I know, there is.
[07:49.80]There is a lot of stuff I need to get set up.
[07:53.45]Like removing Gold Rush.
[07:55.99]What?
[07:56.99]Really?
[07:57.31]You don't like Gold Rush?
[07:59.09]It's alright sometimes.
[08:00.21]I don't know, it seems like it's come up a lot.
[08:02.41]Every time I look at you on the server, it's like, hey, let's play Gold Rush.
[08:05.23]Oh, I love Gold Rush.
[08:07.22]Gold Rush is like my favorite map.
[08:09.26]Okay, I didn't say anything.
[08:10.42]I'm sorry.
[08:13.18]No, I gotta... There's a lot of things that have to happen with this server.
[08:20.55]Alright, you still... Is it still full?
[08:23.01]Yeah.
[08:24.04]I'm about to do something right now.
[08:27.32]It's a drastic time.
[08:28.34]It's got drastic measures.
[08:30.22]Are you leaving your server?
[08:31.84]No.
[08:32.86]I'm going to restart it.
[08:36.55]I guess that's the fairest way to do it.
[08:38.55]I guess this is the really only way.
[08:40.77]The fair way.
[08:41.41]If no one's leaving, you're all getting out.
[08:44.29]It's closed.
[08:48.78]Uh-oh.
[08:50.99]This is my server, but we're trying to get Star in the game.
[08:54.29]And my reserve slot isn't really set up correctly, so it doesn't work.
[08:58.16]So I need to restart the server.
[09:00.70]Just to make it so everyone can get in if they need to.
[09:03.56]Server is going to restart right now, after I do this.
[09:07.20]Let me do this.
[09:13.93]Log into here.
[09:17.53]How's your morning doing?
[09:18.21]You said you just woke up?
[09:20.07]Yep.
[09:22.33]Sick.
[09:24.79]That's the best kind of out of bed.
[09:27.35]Yeah, just... Oh, at least I went to the bathroom first.
[09:37.77]It wasn't like, hey, computer.
[09:39.23]Yeah, at least you... Did you do number one, number two, number three, or all of them?
[09:48.95]Number one, it smelled like pork.
[09:51.19]What?
[09:52.47]Extra info.
[09:55.49]You could have said all the above.
[09:57.37]Oh, no.
[09:57.83]I had to give the extra info.
[09:59.57]Like brag that I ate a whole bunch of pulled pork yesterday and it's probably the greatest food ever made.
[10:05.34]I love pulled pork.
[10:06.24]Pulled pork is incredible.
[10:08.80]Alright, so here we go.
[10:10.00]Server is going to restart.
[10:13.46]So, start spamming.
[10:19.43]It's like I'm playing Diablo 3.
[10:20.33]The R would be if neither of us got on.
[10:27.51]Look at this.
[10:28.99]Look at how stupid this is right now.
[10:30.73]It's like, oh, can we get into my own server?
[10:32.27]Oh my god, I think I got into my own server!
[10:36.25]Yes!
[10:37.09]Oh, we're on Harvest Event.
[10:40.15]Did you get in?
[10:41.19]Yes.
[10:41.69]It is a good day to be Harvest Event.
[10:44.82]It is a good day.
[10:51.09]Well, that's one way to do it, so now we can start the stream.
[10:53.87]So, thank you for your patience, dudes.
[10:55.93]I appreciate it.
[10:58.49]It only took, like, 75 hours to start the stream.
[11:02.35]Only all the hours.
[11:07.95]All the things.
[11:11.75]You're joking.
[11:13.51]Alright.
[11:13.79]I have to restart TF2.
[11:14.91]Oh, do you really?
[11:19.51]Oh, we cursed it.
[11:20.85]Yeah, I do.
[11:22.47]Did something break?
[11:24.79]My graphics card immediately crashed.
[11:26.73]Oh, God.
[11:29.13]Alright, well, you will get in here if you restart as quick as you can.
[11:32.79]I'll do it quick.
[11:34.35]Speedrun.
[11:35.15]Join TF2.
[11:36.14]It still looks like 7 on 7 right now.
[11:38.98]And if not, then I'm going to have to kick somebody.
[11:43.34]Someone who's playing Spy.
[11:46.64]That's how you'll choose.
[11:49.20]It's full!
[11:50.09]Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.
[11:51.37]Oh, yes.
[11:52.93]Yes!
[11:55.95]Where'd he go?
[11:57.43]I need to get, like, a custom HUD, like, a real custom HUD, because right now this thing is, like, blocking my view.
[12:01.55]This is capture and hold the control points to win the game.
[12:03.44]It's like, I didn't know that.
[12:06.42]Tell me again.
[12:09.60]Oh, I just, I thought that was a trade.
[12:10.86]Sorry.
[12:11.28]You were trying to do it when we do it again.
[12:12.46]I'm sorry.
[12:12.80]I thought that was a trade.
[12:22.87]Oh, run.
[12:23.69]The control point is being captured.
[12:32.20]I was just assuming the item server was perpetually down.
[12:37.76]Yeah, it should be up.
[12:42.42]I got my items.
[12:43.40]Yeah, I do.
[12:47.00]So, hello everybody.
[12:49.22]Welcome to this early Sunday stream.
[12:52.66]We've got special guest Star here.
[12:55.58]I am going to bottom frag every time.
[12:58.48]I probably will, too.
[13:01.76]All I want to do is jump.
[13:03.16]I like jumping.
[13:09.07]Jump this way, not that way.
[13:13.43]Oh, God.
[13:14.23]Why is it doing this?
[13:15.13]Okay, it didn't crash.
[13:16.25]It didn't crash.
[13:16.91]It's all good.
[13:17.49]Good, good, good, good, good, good.
[13:21.91]Alright, I'm getting shot at from somewhere.
[13:26.91]Oh, I'm too crazy!
[13:28.59]He punched me.
[13:30.14]He actually punched me.
[13:33.40]See, I changed my setup a little bit.
[13:35.02]See, I'm playing obviously in a window, and I moved the window to like the right part of my screen.
[13:41.62]So I'm just like, look, it's really, I gotta get used to this.
[13:44.25]Because I have the chat on the left and I have the window.
[13:47.13]I know, I need two monitors so bad.
[13:49.17]It
[13:49.89]I can't believe I waited as long as I did to get it.
[13:52.87]Just for streaming.
[13:53.69]That's enough reason.
[13:55.85]You know what, I just need... I need a, uh... I need a better computer.
[14:01.17]You know, the problem is my computer is just... It's good, I have a really good computer, but it's just not good enough.
[14:08.04]To do two things at the same time.
[14:14.40]I'm gonna go scout.
[14:16.72]I'm going scout.
[14:18.79]What?
[14:19.11]Somebody's asking the IP?
[14:20.33]It's just in my server.
[14:21.83]Oh, and I got smashed right there.
[14:23.45]That's not good.
[14:25.07]The Mini-Sentries.
[14:27.49]I shouldn't even mention it.
[14:28.73]Wait, nothing?
[14:29.27]What?
[14:29.57]What am I complaining about?
[14:30.37]Nothing.
[14:32.26]Nobody heard it.
[14:34.96]No one heard.
[14:41.72]Oh, get him!
[14:43.78]I can't believe I got up and he got away.
[14:46.62]Also another problem, Harvest event is really dark, so it's hard to see anyways.
[14:52.51]This map is... I should play it more often because I play way too much Harvest, but this is totally different.
[15:00.87]Yeah, it's like a whole new world.
[15:03.65]Playing crit scout.
[15:08.33]Yeah!
[15:09.49]Can't even go over there.
[15:14.55]Killing people with rocket jumps.
[15:18.87]rocket job.
[15:21.41]Oh, no, I ran into the damn ghost.
[15:23.75]I hate this ghost.
[15:25.43]Why is this map in my rotation?
[15:26.75]I don't know why.
[15:28.87]I missed.
[15:30.29]Actually, it's good every now and then.
[15:33.31]Yeah.
[15:35.39]Kind of like, uh, I really hate Ioduct for the fact that it has pumpkins laying everywhere.
[15:40.72]When you get killed by a pumpkin, you feel like an idiot, but Ioduct looks amazing compared to the other Viaducts.
[15:47.69]Yeah, Ioduct is fun.
[15:50.19]I just got killed by a pumpkin.
[15:54.84]Crit scout.
[15:55.62]Crit scout.
[15:56.36]Oh, come on.
[15:57.90]He wasn't even there before.
[16:00.16]That's malarkey.
[16:02.32]Malarkey.
[16:03.66]Malarkey.
[16:05.06]Malarkey.
[16:08.34]I'm going this way.
[16:11.52]Somebody's behind me, but I want to kill the soldier.
[16:13.00]He's dead anyways.
[16:14.80]No, this guy's got me.
[16:15.74]This guy's got me.
[16:18.95]Oh, this guy's got me.
[16:20.45]Oh, no, I got him.
[16:25.00]I'm not going in there.
[16:26.22]Pumpkin.
[16:28.66]Pumpkin.
[16:35.85]I shouldn't have shot him from that far away.
[16:39.75]Too bad.
[16:40.91]Too bad.
[16:46.65]Actually not doing too bad right now.
[16:49.75]Well, I'm doing terrible, because I haven't market guarded anyone yet.
[16:52.59]Hey, it's all for that montage, remember?
[16:57.99]Totally.
[17:01.28]I got the most amazing one yesterday.
[17:04.98]Quite literally, the most amazing market guard I've ever had.
[17:07.16]It's probably ever happened.
[17:08.60]Ever.
[17:11.01]What'd you do?
[17:13.27]It's...
[17:15.84]I don't know how to describe it, but it was four rocket jumps.
[17:19.14]I was surfing up a ramp, so I was technically on the ground, except it doesn't count you as on the ground.
[17:26.51]You know, is it the same type of thing when you... You know when you airblast somebody that's on an incline, and they don't go anywhere, but technically they're still in the air?
[17:35.70]Yeah, it's like if anything is slanted and you rocket jump fast enough, you'll slide up it, and it sort of launches you off.
[17:41.48]It was the middle of sliding up something, and I hit somebody.
[17:44.59]Yeah, when I use the Reserve Shooter, I'll airblast somebody that's on an incline.
[17:49.70]They don't go anywhere, but I still get the mini-crits on them.
[17:51.52]It's weird.
[17:56.02]Is the server full?
[17:56.98]I believe it is.
[17:59.54]I believe it is.
[18:00.06]You have to imagine so.
[18:03.09]This is your first stream ever?
[18:04.33]You're welcome.
[18:06.05]Thanks for coming, man.
[18:10.97]Oh, chaos.
[18:12.57]Absolute chaos.
[18:16.57]I need health.
[18:17.05]I'm not going after that Demoman without health.
[18:19.63]What a bad idea.
[18:20.49]Why am I drinking this right here?
[18:21.63]That was a terrible idea.
[18:27.23]I'm good.
[18:28.23]Ah, crap.
[18:29.83]Ow.
[18:32.09]That is star.
[18:33.19]That is star.
[18:34.47]Your ears are not deceiving you.
[18:37.42]I think I just rocket jumped off a pumpkin and it was glorious.
[18:45.09]Is that possible?
[18:46.35]Can you actually do that?
[18:47.57]Either that or a rocket hit me as I jumped.
[18:49.27]I don't know.
[19:01.56]Oh, I was pulling out.
[19:03.72]That was just one of those moments when my whole body just shook, because I was pulling out my melee and he shot me.
[19:12.47]Nearly 11 p.m.
[19:15.87]Uni-Q Bandit, where are you from, man?
[19:17.29]That's a long... That's a huge difference.
[19:26.08]Yay, pumpkin!
[19:30.11]Yes, this is being recorded and will be uploaded in a few hours, whenever I finish.
[19:38.21]14 days, you gotta wait for it.
[19:39.31]It's two weeks for processing.
[19:45.75]Actually, you know, the 720 streams on YouTube, they do take quite a long time to process.
[19:52.93]Really?
[19:54.04]Melbourne, Australia.
[19:56.18]That is across the whole world.
[19:58.02]Well, thanks for coming, dude.
[19:59.90]It's a long ways away.
[20:04.79]Go in.
[20:07.15]Immaculate crits.
[20:15.29]I can't go over there.
[20:15.99]That's certain death.
[20:16.73]Get out of here.
[20:17.29]Go, go, go.
[20:20.55]Oh, it's a ghost.
[20:28.06]I am so dead.
[20:28.72]Nice shot, dude.
[20:30.54]Nice shot.
[20:35.86]Do I have any scout tips?
[20:38.88]Star, do you have any scout tips?
[20:41.84]Shoot things, I guess.
[20:44.82]Shoot things and run.
[20:47.34]Yeah.
[20:50.67]I will tell you though, scout, for me at least, used to be one of my worst classes.
[20:54.99]I was awful.
[20:56.72]And I just played.
[20:57.30]It's just the more you play with it, the better you're going to get.
[21:00.54]Die a lot.
[21:02.14]I had, like, a... Die a lot.
[21:05.77]I had pretty much... It was my least played class behind Pyro.
[21:11.65]Now it's one of my most played classes.
[21:14.33]Oh, god.
[21:18.73]You need to die a lot to start realizing you're going to die a lot.
[21:22.50]And stop dying.
[21:23.70]I think we've got a robot star here.
[21:27.21]I'm sorry.
[21:28.45]Oh, no, no, not anymore, not anymore.
[21:29.93]Okay.
[21:31.97]I am getting random lag spikes, so maybe every once in a while I'll be a robot.
[21:36.75]That's okay.
[21:37.99]We forgive you.
[21:41.25]We all still love you.
[21:44.61]I think that's Spy.
[21:46.04]No, yeah, it is.
[21:46.96]Oh, yeah, it is.
[21:50.96]I can smell you getting off the elevator.
[21:55.84]There's no elevator on this map.
[21:58.84]You were here last night too, wasn't you?
[22:02.34]Come on, what's that from stuff?
[22:04.94]I don't know.
[22:05.64]Oh, come on.
[22:06.56]I'm sorry, I'm not cool.
[22:10.02]Oh, Home Alone 2.
[22:11.18]I'm the one that's not cool and you're here quoting Home Alone.
[22:16.34]Never mind.
[22:16.86]I'm fine.
[22:21.36]Oh my god, I love that movie.
[22:25.35]Beep boop, Sean.
[22:26.33]Beep boop.
[22:34.14]Oh, so I went to Dunkin' Donuts.
[22:36.55]Don't do it.
[22:37.79]Oh, it's so good.
[22:40.73]You've got Dunkin' Donuts in New Jersey.
[22:41.93]It's all over the place, isn't it?
[22:45.58]I actually, on one train ride home from Boston, there's Dunkin' Donuts.
[22:49.17]There's like three Dunkin' Donuts in South Station.
[22:52.69]So I bought a dozen chocolate frosted donuts for myself.
[22:57.77]The person getting them for me, the entire time they're picking out donuts, giving me this awkward look.
[23:04.12]What could you possibly be using these for?
[23:08.82]That's a lot for one person.
[23:11.86]I ate them.
[23:13.73]It's okay.
[23:14.87]Need two slots.
[23:16.79]You need two reserve slots.
[23:25.94]Please reply, what server is it?
[23:27.56]It's my server.
[23:30.40]My server.
[23:32.70]Jerma's East Coast server.
[23:37.69]No, put it down!
[23:39.57]I hate when that happens.
[23:40.33]When you go too far, you just miss with the Mini-Sentry.
[23:44.63]That's too far, man.
[23:45.47]When do you miss with the Mini-Sentry?
[23:48.09]I don't know.
[23:49.21]For some reason, it happens, though.
[23:52.99]Oh god, there's the ghost again.
[23:54.74]You know what?
[23:55.12]I'm just going to taunt.
[23:56.84]Oh, when you taunt, I'm just dancing.
[23:59.58]Oh wait, that's because I have that.
[24:00.60]I thought I had the Gunslinger out.
[24:02.68]But I didn't.
[24:08.45]Where is he?
[24:09.61]I heard a spy.
[24:10.27]That was a dumb thing.
[24:16.58]Someone said donuts are amazing, especially Krispy Kremes.
[24:19.92]You ever had a Krispy Kreme donut?
[24:21.96]Um, I think so?
[24:23.60]No?
[24:24.54]Maybe?
[24:25.40]Oh, they are so good.
[24:27.42]Krispy Kreme donuts are incredible.
[24:30.47]I didn't know donuts had names.
[24:32.67]Well, it's like a company.
[24:34.01]It's kind of like a Dunkin' Donuts.
[24:36.40]Except it's Krispy Kremes.
[24:39.84]Pretty much a Krispy Kreme donut is just a glazed donut, and it literally melts inside of your mouth.
[24:45.30]It is just unreal.
[24:47.86]There's only a few of them around the Northeast, though.
[24:51.60]Unfortunate thing.
[24:52.26]Have you ever had ice cream?
[24:58.41]Ice cream?
[24:59.13]What's ice cream?
[25:00.21]Is that something to do with milk?
[25:02.57]I think so.
[25:03.43]What am I doing?
[25:04.01]Why am I doing this?
[25:07.61]Am I ever going to put a ping limit on my server?
[25:11.39]To be honest, probably not.
[25:17.85]The only reason why I say that is because I haven't had one in the last two or three weeks since the server's been online.
[25:24.13]And there hasn't really been any problems.
[25:25.99]So, probably not.
[25:27.49]And if there ever was one, it would probably be something very, very high.
[25:30.20]Something ridiculously high, like 480 or something.
[25:34.53]That's pretty low.
[25:37.63]I wish I had 480 thing.
[25:44.27]Oh, this heavy... Oh my god, I ran out of bullets!
[25:47.15]Oh no!
[25:49.77]Oh, why did I... You're dead.
[25:50.95]Oh, why did I do that?
[25:55.63]Mr. Foreman Gary.
[25:58.23]The Foreman.
[25:59.29]Gary.
[26:03.19]Okay.
[26:05.08]I think this is this guy's name.
[26:07.74]He told me to say his name.
[26:12.32]And I just did it, because I felt like it.
[26:15.47]Don't worry, we'll get this thing built up, baby.
[26:17.09]Let's do it, baby.
[26:20.45]There was a ghost.
[26:23.86]I'll name him Gary.
[26:25.02]Oh, what?
[26:25.72]I didn't get it off in time?
[26:28.10]Oh, I'm so mad at myself.
[26:30.93]Let's go for a punch.
[26:31.75]Ready?
[26:33.19]Get over here, you son of a... I got him.
[26:38.13]We're going punch-only Engineer right now.
[26:40.00]It's gonna work.
[26:40.50]Because every time I stream... I'm telling you, dude.
[26:43.48]Every time I stream and I just go for melee only, for some reason it works.
[26:47.66]I don't know why.
[26:48.72]I don't know.
[26:50.20]I wish I knew the answer.
[26:52.06]But for instance, like... Oh my god, this guy just critscreened me.
[26:55.60]No, I have to...
[27:06.52]Oh.
[27:07.34]That was a nice attempt with the NG fist only critskrig.
[27:12.94]It's super effective.
[27:15.02]That's for Pokémon.
[27:19.10]I hate this door glitch on Harvest.
[27:21.12]I just want to leave.
[27:22.46]Are you stuck somewhere?
[27:25.39]I'm out.
[27:25.65]I'm out.
[27:28.37]Oh!
[27:30.13]punch in the center.
[27:30.86]I'm going to punch the crap out of it.
[27:32.96]Alright, so I'm going to ask you this first before I answer it, but do you like Vikings?
[27:46.57]Vikings?
[27:49.43]Like real Vikings, or are we talking about fictional Vikings right now?
[27:55.10]I don't know.
[27:55.40]Yeah, it was just a question.
[27:57.06]No, I meant to hit Jay.
[27:58.31]I hate how Jay and Kay are right next to each other.
[27:59.83]Well, I mean, Thor was okay.
[28:06.45]So... Yeah, Thor was okay.
[28:09.91]I enjoy Vikings.
[28:10.99]I think they're fun.
[28:12.57]But if you're having stream issues, try to refresh the stream.
[28:16.52]Refresh the page.
[28:16.96]I thought you were going to say, if you're having stream issues, then Vikings aren't that good.
[28:26.77]Yeah, especially if you're on 720, then a good refresh of the stream will probably help you out.
[28:32.60]Probably.
[28:33.72]And Vikings are even worse.
[28:37.14]How does it look, by the way, for anyone watching?
[28:39.48]Because this is only the second time I've ever streamed in 720.
[28:41.58]Are we good?
[28:44.26]We sound good?
[28:44.88]We look good?
[28:45.35]We smell good?
[28:46.81]And your internet's fine with that?
[28:49.15]Apparently.
[28:50.05]It wasn't last night, that's for sure.
[28:54.02]I've not tried to stream 720 in a long time.
[28:57.82]My internet just seems that it doesn't enjoy it.
[28:59.98]I'd rather lay back.
[29:04.87]If all goes well, then that's... Last time I did 720, it seemed to work okay.
[29:10.78]but last night I was trying to set it up, because I usually stream on Saturday nights, and it was just like, nope.
[29:16.80]I could barely stream at 360 last night.
[29:18.74]I was, like, testing it by myself, unlisted.
[29:21.79]Or private, whatever.
[29:23.29]And it just was not happening.
[29:30.49]If you're having stream problems, I feel bad for you, son.
[29:32.81]I got 99 problems, but a stream ain't one.
[29:35.74]Nope!
[29:37.00]Joby.
[29:38.86]Joby?
[29:39.34]I love your quotes.
[29:43.44]What did I tell you?
[29:45.04]Just punching.
[29:46.24]Oh, you're not getting away.
[29:48.30]That was a shotgun.
[29:50.30]No, it wasn't.
[29:51.50]Okay.
[29:54.21]That was a... I punched my fist and it looked like a shotgun.
[30:00.71]Oh my god.
[30:02.15]Chaos!
[30:10.05]There's like a line of soldiers waiting to mark your guard in me.
[30:16.73]I'll go, no, wait, you go.
[30:22.49]What class is Star?
[30:23.64]Star... Spied spawn.
[30:26.58]I was spying.
[30:29.24]What class is a... What class is Star?
[30:33.64]He's a soldier.
[30:34.98]Sorry, when that spy backstabbed me, I had like an aneurysm or something.
[30:38.43]That was weird.
[30:39.88]Don't do that.
[30:40.86]It's not good for you.
[30:48.28]Oh, Mini-Sentry fight.
[30:49.94]Oh, we got two Mini-Sentries and we got a spy.
[30:54.59]I am almost there.
[30:55.41]81 kills on my Market Gardener.
[30:58.17]81?
[30:59.33]81.
[30:59.39]Nice.
[30:59.63]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[31:10.58]Somebody asked, am I going to do another scary game facecam?
[31:14.59]Yeah.
[31:15.09]Dude, that game was horrible.
[31:17.11]Horrible in the terms of I completely... I'm with you.
[31:20.59]I'm not good with scary games.
[31:22.37]Like, just watch.
[31:23.20]Oh, God, please.
[31:24.18]Why are you still going down?
[31:26.68]We've agreed this is a bad idea.
[31:29.64]It's, you know what, it's because I started, I'll give you guys, I'll give you the backstory about that video.
[31:35.46]So I started recording, and I figured, because I got a bunch of people asking me to do that.
[31:41.13]Somebody was like, oh, do Amnesia, do SCP, do this or that.
[31:44.47]So I just was like, you know what, I'm going to do it.
[31:45.69]I feel like doing it.
[31:46.91]And I got to a point where I was going to turn it off.
[31:49.74]I was like, you know what, I'm not going to make this video.
[31:51.68]Like, I'll just do something else.
[31:53.08]Like, I'm not going to make this video.
[31:55.02]Because I sat down with it, and did you notice how the video started?
[31:58.66]When I was, like, kind of down, like, two, like, I wanted to... Yeah, when, like, 19, it sort of, uh, fades out.
[32:04.46]Yeah, like, I, I, I just, I pretty much get, oh, god, I'm lagging, why?
[32:09.29]Oh, no, that's the door, that's the door glitch I think you were talking about before.
[32:12.49]Um, but I, I, I, the video starts, and I'm, like, already down two floors.
[32:17.41]That's because I stopped recording, and I'm just sitting there going, I don't, I'll, I can't do this.
[32:24.32]I really didn't think I could do it, and then halfway through when I was actually recording, you can see it in my face during the video.
[32:31.02]Oh my god, overtime, overtime.
[32:32.32]This is a pretty ridiculous fight.
[32:33.45]I'll get back to that story in a second.
[32:36.63]We lost.
[32:37.27]No!
[32:39.35]Round ends as I'm mid-air.
[32:42.61]That's all that matters.
[32:43.53]That's all that matters.
[32:47.20]Nothing else matters.
[32:49.79]But yeah, so I mean, I started to get to that point where I got, the first spook, the first big jumping scare, for a second I was like, you know what, I'm about to hit, I'm going to hit escape, F9, and I'm not doing it.
[33:02.94]But that's when I said, you know what, I can't give up.
[33:06.54]I'm already halfway done with this thing, I might as well finish it.
[33:10.94]And when that guy comes out, that's, ugh.
[33:13.92]I'm not going to ruin it, really.
[33:15.10]It is terrifying.
[33:21.06]And Rage quits the game for you, too.
[33:23.10]That's why, like, at the end of the video, I look like somebody hit me in the face with a wrench.
[33:26.20]After that, I watched more videos of the game, because, like, I wanted to figure out, like, how it ended, or if there was more.
[33:33.38]Yeah, I freaked out, because... Seriously, like... What you saw at the end of that video was, like, a 100% genuine, like, my face.
[33:43.09]I didn't even know what was going on.
[33:44.83]I freaked out, and then I was just like, wait, what happened?
[33:47.43]Why am I...
[33:49.78]I was genuinely befuddled.
[33:52.84]No, that's not good.
[33:56.63]Live stream it.
[33:57.45]Do it again, just keep playing it.
[34:00.99]Make like three more commentaries of that game.
[34:06.80]You will become known as the Stair Simulator guy.
[34:09.90]The Stair Simulator channel.
[34:11.08]Whenever there's a new Stair Simulator, you're on it.
[34:14.82]Somebody was telling me to do Containment Breach, and I looked up a couple things on it, and my god, that game... Oh my god.
[34:22.77]It just looks ten times worse than SCP-087, the regular one.
[34:33.27]Ah, nice shot.
[34:34.92]No, I'm gonna go... Spy.
[34:38.96]Like, that one is actually 3D creatures and weird stuff.
[34:43.63]Well, not really 3D, but it's... I was scared playing Quake 4, so... This is a game you should not be scared playing.
[34:53.21]Quake 4.
[34:55.68]Yeah, there's this one room where there's, like, a giant beating heart in it, and it's really dark.
[34:59.96]And it took me, like, 20 minutes to get through, but all you have to do is walk up some stairs, and, like, the mission's over.
[35:05.66]I was, like, just crouched walking the whole time, like, nope, nope.
[35:09.48]Nope.
[35:12.68]Oh, we're gonna get a... I knew that was gonna happen.
[35:16.33]I knew that was gonna happen.
[35:20.17]What class do I play the most?
[35:21.33]Probably Engineer.
[35:24.61]Actually, we'll take a look.
[35:25.63]Can I do it from here?
[35:28.47]Stats.
[35:28.79]Here you go.
[35:30.13]I actually don't think I've ever shown this.
[35:31.57]I did it in a Q&A one time, but these are my Team Fortress 2 stats.
[35:36.48]And the reason why Spy is so high is because back in 2007, that's all I played.
[35:43.80]Got a Spy.
[35:44.74]I was looking at my stats the other day, and I was disappointed with how much Spy I played.
[35:48.85]Mm-hmm.
[35:49.64]Like, 35 hours?
[35:51.24]When did I do that?
[35:52.02]When did I waste that much time?
[35:53.78]Yeah, I have 138 hours.
[35:55.01]Dude, that's nothing, though.
[35:56.69]And also, this is, um... I think my stats got reset at some point.
[36:02.19]Like, very early on in the game.
[36:04.37]Oh yeah, I reset mine a while.
[36:05.97]Yeah.
[36:09.45]Oh god.
[36:10.53]There was one day where I was playing with bots, and no one was playing with bots.
[36:14.34]I was like, well, I have to do this.
[36:16.22]I have to reset this.
[36:20.63]Bye.
[36:22.11]Spy on spy on spy.
[36:27.37]Whoa, whoa, no, I didn't want to hit N. Alright, team, what do you say we do this?
[36:33.95]Come on, let's go, baby.
[36:39.06]We're all hitting this together.
[36:42.72]Oh, I'll play spy.
[36:45.24]Spy?
[36:46.54]Spy.
[36:49.72]But I want to be the cool kind of person who plays spy.
[36:51.66]I want to be the coolest kind of spy.
[36:54.97]Oh, come on!
[36:55.63]I was trying to... Did I actually get away with that?
[36:57.31]I think I did.
[36:59.03]No, I didn't.
[37:06.41]Oh, god.
[37:07.06]I just keep getting people right when they have no health.
[37:09.10]That's how you do it.
[37:16.96]Oh, I knew I was going to screw that up.
[37:20.23]I knew I was gonna screw that up.
[37:24.31]That's a bad attitude.
[37:30.22]I did a Dead Space 2 video.
[37:31.90]Well, technically, but I technically did.
[37:33.80]Grandpa has one on Respawn.
[37:39.27]There's a hole in this straw, and I can't drink the rest of my iced tea.
[37:43.53]There's supposed to be a hole in it.
[37:44.69]That's how straws work.
[37:46.13]No, I... Aren't you so glad I'm here?
[37:50.43]I am.
[37:51.31]I... It's... Hold on, let me fix this stupid straw.
[37:59.33]There we go.
[38:00.59]I did the best thing.
[38:02.43]I flipped the straw upside down and put it back in.
[38:06.00]Genius.
[38:07.24]I know, I am a genius.
[38:08.24]I have no idea where we're going.
[38:09.42]I should have just changed the map to begin with, but I was too busy not paying attention.
[38:12.76]It's a gold rush.
[38:13.98]Hopefully it's gold rush.
[38:14.96]Star's favorite map.
[38:17.81]Like, nowhere to jump.
[38:20.69]I love gold rush so much.
[38:24.70]Actually, I did see one person who can do a jump on second map of Gold Rush, from start to finish, all the way through with one jump.
[38:34.23]I'd probably just spend the entire round trying to do that.
[38:38.45]And if I did it, our team would win.
[38:40.53]Just instantly.
[38:41.61]It's like getting a nuke.
[38:44.37]It's like getting a nuke.
[38:48.04]Somebody asked, do I like... Yeah, I'm using the Diamondback, because I like it.
[38:53.71]And plus, it shits strange, too, so... Gotta use it if it's strange.
[38:58.95]I think the Diamondback has a bad rap.
[39:02.71]It's... It's okay.
[39:04.85]I mean, it's not... It's... When you're fighting, like, 40 Gunslinger NGs, it's... Yeah.
[39:10.89]Well, let's put it this way, right?
[39:11.89]So the Ambassador and the Diamondback do the same damage, right?
[39:16.81]The Ambassador shoots slower.
[39:19.59]The Ambassador shoots 20% slower than the Diamondback.
[39:23.08]But you get crits on the headshots.
[39:25.38]I mean, you get crits on this, like you said, if there are Mini-Sentries around.
[39:28.26]I would say they're both good.
[39:30.58]A lot of people really bash on the Diamondback.
[39:33.78]Well, the best part about the Diamondback is the sound.
[39:36.54]Oh, yeah.
[39:37.60]So, I mean, technically, it's like a better... It's a... Default, if you're not going for headshots, it's better than the Ambassador.
[39:45.26]If you can't get headshots, it's better than the Ambassador, for sure.
[39:49.36]The Ambassador is still, though, it's so good.
[39:52.77]It's so good.
[40:00.65]Oh, yeah, playing that guitar.
[40:03.51]Oh, yeah.
[40:06.42]Why am I wearing that, like, Christmas item?
[40:10.66]I gotta put my ring on that somebody gave me.
[40:14.53]I have, like, the Christmas heart thing on.
[40:18.31]You're just... I don't know.
[40:21.49]You're... hearty.
[40:23.65]I'm a cold bastard.
[40:24.55]That's all I can think of.
[40:29.02]I totally forgot.
[40:30.16]The frying pan.
[40:34.14]The frying pan is...
[40:36.71]Oh, there's a Mini-Sentry.
[40:39.10]GG.
[40:41.62]I'm gonna take that out.
[40:46.08]New rank!
[40:49.24]Screenshot.
[40:50.20]Post to Reddit.
[40:51.78]Screenshot, screenshot, screenshot.
[40:53.40]I need health, what am I doing?
[41:00.67]Hide behind the cot.
[41:04.39]I blew up in the bush.
[41:05.25]Oh, get over here!
[41:06.31]Get over here!
[41:07.91]Oh, God.
[41:09.09]Oh, alright, here we go.
[41:20.70]I want to kill you.
[41:26.12]Oh, my God.
[41:27.55]That was so... I'm sorry, dude.
[41:28.81]That was like a face stab and a half.
[41:31.01]Don't ask me how that happened.
[41:44.54]I want that medic.
[41:45.44]I want to kill that medic.
[41:47.56]I want that medic to heal me.
[41:55.54]Yeah, I'm disguised as you.
[41:57.44]I know the deal.
[41:59.10]I try to sidestab and it never works because I'm too terrible a spy.
[42:04.28]But you spent all the hours.
[42:06.21]No, I got body blocked.
[42:11.83]It's gonna be awesome.
[42:17.39]Get Fear 3?
[42:18.61]Fear 3.
[42:20.01]Fear 3 being scary?
[42:21.46]I don't think so.
[42:23.58]I heard it's got its moments.
[42:25.64]My roommate in college played.
[42:27.14]He was a big fan of Fear 1 and 2.
[42:29.10]He praised the game all the time.
[42:30.48]I just never had time to play it, to be honest.
[42:34.82]Oh, Lion Cast.
[42:36.35]I gotta talk about that.
[42:39.27]I will talk about that.
[42:40.91]I think I want to do it in a proper video, though, not really in a live stream.
[42:43.81]Wait, that's you.
[42:46.79]I shoot you, I'm sorry.
[42:50.98]It's okay.
[42:51.82]Pretty much, for the just about 400 people watching right now, I will give you a sneak peek of what's going on.
[43:00.29]I'm playing in a tournament.
[43:01.27]For those of you that know IncredibleOrb, he put together a team.
[43:06.26]It's an invite-only tournament for this new game that's not out yet.
[43:10.38]I don't even know if I can say the name of the game.
[43:11.92]It's not even in pre-alpha.
[43:14.30]But this next weekend, we're going to be playing a tournament.
[43:20.97]Me, IncredibleOrb, and MLC_St3alth.
[43:22.89]And whoever wins that tournament, it's going to be all streamed.
[43:25.67]TotalBiscuit's going to be casting it.
[43:27.61]It's going to be pretty ridiculous.
[43:29.77]And if you win, you go to E3.
[43:32.45]And if you win that, you go to Paris.
[43:34.80]I want to win.
[43:37.02]I'm not even in it, but I want to win.
[43:40.38]Oh, give me that crit!
[43:41.20]Give me that crit!
[43:43.00]Oh no, no, please, please, I want to get this crit, please.
[43:45.41]Yes, yes.
[43:47.03]But yeah, it's not... It's kind of like a Quake type game.
[43:51.82]It's kind of like a Quake mod type game.
[43:56.16]But yeah, it is... It is a... Oh, you're going to get crit right here, baby.
[44:04.86]Do it.
[44:06.08]But I'll make a proper video explaining what it actually is in a vlog or something in the next couple days.
[44:12.46]But it's exciting.
[44:13.10]It's really exciting.
[44:13.86]I haven't been able to talk about it.
[44:15.24]So my lips have had to be sealed for the last couple weeks.
[44:19.90]But yeah, maybe we'll get to go to E3.
[44:21.98]I need to do more secret things.
[44:25.70]So I can be like, hey, I'm doing something I can't talk about.
[44:29.74]I need to do more secret stuff.
[44:33.01]Please don't shoot me.
[44:33.79]Wow.
[44:34.35]That was an amazing shot.
[44:36.45]Too bad he didn't kill me.
[44:41.66]Yeah, TotalBiscuit... Yeah, I forget their names.
[44:44.38]There's three, like, super, super famous guys that are gonna be casting it on Twitch.
[44:48.46]I don't know their names, though.
[44:49.46]I know TotalBiscuit.
[44:50.88]That's it.
[44:51.48]Well, that doesn't matter.
[44:52.32]I just did a good rocket jump.
[44:54.08]That's all that matters.
[44:58.84]What?
[44:59.26]What?
[44:59.76]Why am I on fire?
[45:01.28]Look at this!
[45:02.10]What's going on?
[45:03.12]I can't look at this.
[45:04.04]Why am I on fire right now?
[45:06.62]What was that?
[45:07.90]Admin abuse.
[45:10.26]I pulled up the Dead Ringer, and I... Oh, that was... I think I just had a brain fart right there, because I pulled the Dead Ringer out when he lit me.
[45:20.06]And it worked, and then it instantly... Why did I come out of it?
[45:22.30]Did you hear the noise?
[45:23.02]It was like, oh, I came out of the Dead Ringer.
[45:25.44]But I didn't.
[45:25.86]I was still in it.
[45:29.02]It is not Renaissance Heroes.
[45:32.86]Is Orb even online?
[45:33.76]I'm just going to ask him if I can talk about it.
[45:38.49]Can I be like, hey, can I tell people what I'm doing?
[45:40.37]Or is it illegal?
[45:43.61]Nope.
[45:45.63]Ow.
[45:50.18]It would be very cool for us to...
[45:54.68]I'm going to go off spy.
[45:55.60]I'm too stupid right now to go to play anything else.
[46:00.96]Say hello to your Spaniard viewers.
[46:02.80]Hello, everybody in Spain.
[46:04.71]Hope you guys are doing good in that Spaniard land.
[46:11.73]The cool part is I want to go to E3.
[46:13.21]That's the main thing.
[46:14.77]I could really care less about winning the whole thing.
[46:17.86]That was you.
[46:21.47]I could care less about winning, like, the whole thing, but I do... It would be awesome to go to E3.
[46:24.59]Because then I could make videos and stuff about going to E3, and... It would be so much fun.
[46:33.93]Wow, that was a... Wow.
[46:35.51]I am sorry to every single person here that just got covered in that Jurati.
[46:38.76]That was my fault.
[46:46.56]Oh, I got quick-fixed.
[46:48.56]What am I doing?
[46:49.20]I gotta get up here.
[46:51.00]What are you doing?
[46:59.41]Dang.
[47:01.37]And... Ow.
[47:07.73]I hear the Christmas bells.
[47:08.59]I need ammo.
[47:16.65]I need ammo.
[47:22.13]I probably will do more morning streams.
[47:23.75]Well, not really morning streams, but early afternoon streams on Sunday.
[47:28.71]Just because I know that Saturday night can... a lot of people can't watch it.
[47:33.02]And I am sorry about that.
[47:36.42]Yeah.
[47:37.58]Yeah.
[47:43.16]Oh.
[47:47.63]Every time I see somebody in the air, I always think it's you and I get scared.
[47:53.73]It's alright.
[47:54.37]I was next to you, spawn, trying to do something for the last two minutes.
[47:57.41]Oh, it's anytime you're in a... anyone's in the air, I keep thinking it's you and it freaks me out.
[48:05.30]Oh, this is perfect.
[48:06.88]Not far enough, though.
[48:10.08]It's perfect.
[48:13.10]It's from, like, spawn to spawn.
[48:16.52]Spawn to spawn.
[48:18.63]Belly to belly.
[48:19.79]The bum for jumbo.
[48:23.28]To spawn.
[48:23.64]To spawn.
[48:24.70]Belly to belly.
[48:25.62]You know what that's from?
[48:27.00]Back to back belly to belly.
[48:28.56]I think it's from where... Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
[48:33.06]I really think it is.
[48:34.02]The game show.
[48:34.52]The old game show.
[48:36.08]Somebody please look that up.
[48:37.48]Somebody find that out for me right now.
[48:41.56]That show is unwatchable.
[48:43.26]I wouldn't know.
[48:46.76]There he is.
[48:47.38]There he is.
[48:48.68]He's going for those garden kills.
[48:51.53]No...
[48:54.45]Cool.
[48:57.29]Hi, Star.
[48:59.11]Hi.
[49:01.19]Wait, that wasn't you.
[49:03.01]It wasn't.
[49:03.67]No, there's actually... I know Looter.
[49:05.82]He wears the same hat as me.
[49:08.40]Oh my god.
[49:10.84]I thought it was you.
[49:11.74]I was like, oh my god.
[49:12.94]Oh no, if it was me, I would've got you.
[49:16.76]Star sounds a bit robotic.
[49:18.32]He said his internet's going up and down.
[49:20.51]So how are you?
[49:23.60]Not anymore, though.
[49:24.10]You sound fine now.
[49:25.32]Okay, good.
[49:27.84]Have I killed one person this entire time?
[49:30.41]How do I have 18 points?
[49:32.93]What did I do?
[49:34.63]Did I kill anybody?
[49:36.45]I guess so.
[49:36.97]I don't even remember killing anyone.
[49:40.73]I did a jump.
[49:44.36]I did a jump.
[49:46.92]My mommy was proud.
[49:49.90]My cat is scratching the door.
[49:51.54]Oh.
[49:56.77]probably have one of, if not the most annoying cats in the world.
[50:03.63]See, he knows my window when it's open.
[50:06.35]He knows he can come over and annoy me by just going like, until I come let him in.
[50:13.90]And if I don't let him in, he will sit there, he probably wouldn't even eat or sleep until I let him in, like, through, like, the window.
[50:23.67]And it's like, you know there's another way you can go, right?
[50:26.29]You can't get in my window.
[50:28.23]He just knows I'll let him in.
[50:31.03]Always leave it open.
[50:32.77]Hmm.
[50:34.12]So what time is it right now?
[50:36.42]That's the real question.
[50:39.00]I don't know.
[50:41.70]Probably another round or two on TF.
[50:45.44]I think I'm going to transition to some Diablo 3.
[50:48.88]Diablo?
[50:50.52]Some Diablo.
[50:54.51]Because I gotta get my Witch Doctor up, man.
[50:57.20]Level is, you know, I think we're still the same.
[50:59.16]45.
[50:59.80]Oh, I did level up a bit.
[51:02.30]Hold on a second.
[51:04.72]Are there... There's not random crits on right now, is there?
[51:09.58]Nope.
[51:11.72]Was that a... Because that guy was uber-charged.
[51:13.62]He wasn't crits-creaked.
[51:15.71]That was weird.
[51:16.98]I got killed by a crit.
[51:18.50]No, no, no, no, no.
[51:19.28]You know, it probably was like a Buff Banner.
[51:21.10]The PP?
[51:21.92]Probably was the PP banner.
[51:24.16]The PP banner.
[51:25.40]That, I'm gonna get headshot.
[51:28.84]Oh my god, you both just like came in at the same time.
[51:31.62]And I missed.
[51:37.03]Let's go, yeah!
[51:39.61]Let's go!
[51:40.79]You aim with that thing.
[51:45.75]What, the Tommy Slug?
[51:47.48]Yeah, just how do you aim with it?
[51:48.98]It's too hard.
[51:50.12]I love the Tommy Slug.
[51:51.64]It's my favorite.
[51:56.18]It's too hard.
[51:58.97]Aiming is hard.
[52:02.63]Yeah, Star does make rocket jumping look so much fun.
[52:05.49]He also makes it look really easy, too, and it is absolutely not.
[52:14.56]One of the best videos I've ever seen of Team Fortress 2 is that video where you jumped... ...to DUO!
[52:21.19]Where you jumped across, like, the whole thing of Hightower and man-treaded some pyro.
[52:26.11]It was unbelievable.
[52:27.39]That wasn't even that good.
[52:28.25]Oh, it was the best thing I've ever seen.
[52:29.47]You don't even know.
[52:31.23]When I finally put all these Bark Gardener kills together... Well, when you finally put this Bark Gardener thing together, it's probably gonna get, like, 700 million views, because it's gonna be that good.
[52:45.29]The bomb is nearing a checkpoint!
[52:46.79]Can I hide?
[52:52.63]Oh, man.
[52:53.55]Yeah, you did.
[52:57.65]Somebody wrote, I can't believe I'm watching a YouTube stream that's working.
[53:01.55]Yeah.
[53:03.77]Yeah.
[53:04.57]YouTube streams are... Well, they're in beta.
[53:07.71]So there is always going to be a lot of problems.
[53:11.19]But, you know, whatever.
[53:11.85]It's all good.
[53:14.74]And who's the other guy?
[53:15.88]That is Star.
[53:17.74]I'm a guy.
[53:18.95]That is S-T-A-R, Star.
[53:22.33]Thank you for spelling it.
[53:36.04]Somebody write Star's channel in the comment section.
[53:40.86]Just so the people that don't know will know.
[53:47.22]It's youtube.com slash niched.
[53:50.36]N-I-I-C-H-T-S, right?
[53:53.18]Yes.
[53:53.86]You are very good at spelling.
[53:55.92]I usually am pretty bad.
[53:59.15]That's how I know you're going to win this tournament, because I'm guaranteeing it's a spelling bee.
[54:02.81]That's why you don't want to talk about it.
[54:06.31]Oh my god, get out of here.
[54:07.63]It's just on your head.
[54:11.03]Oh, that's so scary.
[54:14.25]I like don't know what to do.
[54:15.49]There's like spies, there's rocket garnering stars, and this other guy that's like another star that's doing it.
[54:25.18]I'm like a heavy... I don't know how I have any points.
[54:27.36]Oh god, I just saw that guy get smoked.
[54:30.85]Oh, here's a pro tip.
[54:32.66]Pro tip as heavy on card.
[54:34.28]If you're being a card heavy, do the crouch dance.
[54:36.94]You gotta go like... You gotta like crouch.
[54:42.36]Crouch.
[54:42.82]Crouch.
[54:43.58]Crouch.
[54:43.82]You guys are gonna win because I think I've convinced my team not to try it at all.
[54:47.38]If you see like the pyro walking out there.
[54:50.55]We're taking it easy.
[54:52.47]Uh-uh.
[55:01.71]Card heavy is fun.
[55:05.47]Yeah, okay.
[55:06.51]It is.
[55:07.13]Card heavy is fun.
[55:09.64]How to jump is card heavy.
[55:12.16]Uh, you gotta get the new rocket launcher for the heavy.
[55:14.04]Yeah.
[55:15.28]The best you could do is, like, Gloves of Running Urgently jumps.
[55:20.07]Here we go, ready?
[55:21.29]I'll show you how to, like, rocket jump as a heavy.
[55:24.29]See, look at how far I just went.
[55:25.33]Uh-oh.
[55:32.31]Oh no, I'm almost out of my large Dunkin' Donuts fresh brewed iced tea.
[55:37.48]That's not a good thing.
[55:39.82]Get another.
[55:41.56]I have to drive to Dunkin' Donuts.
[55:43.02]I wish I just had a Dunkin' Donuts in my house.
[55:47.12]Get a Dunkin' Donuts.
[55:47.90]Just buy a franchise.
[55:49.30]Just own it.
[55:50.12]Just so you can live in it.
[55:53.59]I would.
[55:54.59]If I had a house.
[55:56.79]I'm not even really a big coffee drinker.
[55:58.95]I love iced tea.
[56:00.09]And their iced teas are really, really, really good.
[56:03.41]Oh dear god.
[56:04.27]Chaos.
[56:13.11]Maybe I should shoot some things.
[56:14.57]I think I'm gonna shoot some things.
[56:16.86]Oh yeah?
[56:17.78]Yeah.
[56:20.42]I got, I got a ghost recon.
[56:22.80]They gave me hats.
[56:24.56]Ghost recon?
[56:25.56]Yes.
[56:26.02]So now the classes I'm allowed to play insist of rocket jumping soldier or one of the classes that got a hat.
[56:34.56]Is that game any good?
[56:35.22]Have you played it?
[56:36.50]It's not out yet.
[56:37.12]It's out in like a week.
[56:38.48]It's actually looking really good.
[56:40.30]Yeah, I heard it's supposed to be pretty... Intense.
[56:43.56]They're going a different direction, aren't they?
[56:47.81]It's kind of funny that Ghost Recon is... I love the first one.
[56:53.43]And they have dumbed down the series a lot since then.
[56:55.65]And usually that would piss me off to no end.
[56:58.43]But for some reason this time, I'm glad Ghost Recon is dumber.
[57:03.02]It's like the one game I'm happy about that it's dumber.
[57:05.86]Wasn't the Ghost Recon series very, very strategic?
[57:08.86]Like, you had to play stuff.
[57:10.94]Planning, groups, and this one, I mean, it has all of that, but for the most part, you know it's not going to happen.
[57:16.32]Right, right.
[57:18.32]It's kind of like TF2.
[57:19.06]Hmm.
[57:24.63]See, when I watch trailers of those things, it reminds me of Gears of War a little bit.
[57:28.97]It's like third-person running around.
[57:30.35]Yeah, it's got that third-person vibe to it.
[57:32.71]It has all the wall-hugging mechanics that Gears would have.
[57:37.07]But I don't know.
[57:37.65]I actually wanted this game since they first started showing single-player trailers of it.
[57:42.12]But multiplayer looks pretty fun.
[57:45.32]I love fun things.
[57:46.94]Yeah, definitely.
[57:47.68]I love fun stuff.
[57:52.12]I throw the pee-pee.
[57:55.47]Alright, we'll do... I cannot get on that car.
[57:59.68]What am I doing?
[58:03.14]Why did I just pull that out?
[58:04.10]I'm going to die.
[58:06.32]What do I have this on for?
[58:08.34]I need to put those on.
[58:15.63]Jeremy, you keep running in a circle, I know.
[58:17.51]I know.
[58:19.50]That's what happens when I livestream.
[58:23.72]My two centers of my brain fight for dominance.
[58:25.90]And I just walk around in a circle.
[58:27.75]What happened?
[58:30.63]Oh, we got a wrangled.
[58:32.01]Century, mid-century, that is.
[58:33.87]Yikes.
[58:36.95]I think that's a spy.
[58:38.83]Oh!
[58:40.27]I missed my melee swing because I was in his body.
[58:45.10]Where's this other guy?
[58:46.52]Wait, sandwich, take it.
[58:47.90]Eat it.
[58:48.56]Yeah.
[58:52.46]Come this way, come this way.
[58:53.86]We're gonna go up, we're gonna go up top.
[58:57.94]And... Oh!
[59:03.40]Get on the cart!
[59:06.68]And come on, somebody touch it!
[59:08.70]I should have stayed behind it.
[59:11.14]Yeah, but you didn't.
[59:11.77]You know, I'm stupid.
[59:17.09]So, one more round after this, and then we'll move on to some Dwayablo 3.
[59:22.30]Okay.
[59:27.06]Oh.
[59:28.38]Oh.
[59:29.44]Take that.
[59:30.46]And... I should have got an A. That's a... No, it's not.
[59:38.91]Oh, my... I should have given him a sandwich, my poor medic friend.
[59:42.79]Speaking of sandwich... No!
[59:44.67]D'oh!
[59:51.47]That was essentially a warning.
[59:53.63]New rank.
[59:57.77]I'm sufficient.
[59:58.95]Kind of lethal.
[60:02.59]It's getting there.
[60:05.05]Oh god, spy.
[60:10.19]A spa.
[60:12.81]Yes, this will be on YouTube.
[60:16.07]When I finish the stream, it'll probably be up there after maybe an hour or two of processing.
[60:23.18]What time is it right now?
[60:23.94]It is 9.30am for me.
[60:26.04]Probably stream for another couple hours or so.
[60:28.44]At least another hour.
[60:30.38]And it should be up by maybe noon-ish, maybe?
[60:34.38]Yeah, so YouTube doesn't upload things if they're really long.
[60:37.61]That's what it says.
[60:38.87]I talked to some people and they said that apparently that's not true.
[60:41.74]That's not the case.
[60:44.18]I guess they're just a lie to you.
[60:45.42]It's like, oh, you can't upload an automatic stream longer than two hours, and then people do it.
[60:50.40]So I don't know.
[60:51.22]I guess they would want to discourage everyone.
[60:53.50]I don't know.
[60:54.98]It's weird.
[60:58.12]It's very weird.
[61:01.84]Someone said, since when is Herb Lurga a warning?
[61:04.76]Herb Lurga!
[61:07.00]It is.
[61:07.71]Yeah, it could be seen as a warning.
[61:09.81]Well, what else do you think I'm going to do if I'm screaming at him?
[61:13.82]Besides... I'm either on the toilet or about to kill you.
[61:16.42]Oh, man, they have too many things going on in there.
[61:18.48]Watch out, buddy!
[61:21.70]Yeah, you take the sandwich.
[61:22.58]You need it.
[61:23.76]You, eat sandwich.
[61:27.00]We gotta go around.
[61:27.58]I gotta go around.
[61:32.98]It's all about... They only have a Mini-Sentry, man.
[61:35.80]We're getting pushed back by a Mini-Sentry and a bunch of Demoman.
[61:39.06]Oh god, I'm so dead.
[61:40.70]Oh god.
[61:42.34]Why do I not have these out?
[61:44.04]Somebody ask?
[61:44.54]Alright, here we go, here we go.
[61:50.94]Here we go, come on!
[61:52.56]Come on!
[61:54.38]Somebody help me!
[62:00.60]I shot you with my gun.
[62:02.12]It was a bomb gun.
[62:04.33]A bomb gun?
[62:04.95]Is that noob?
[62:07.07]Yeah.
[62:08.53]I hope I get it.
[62:12.03]Boom.
[62:12.81]I, uh, I'm... Oh, no, no, no.
[62:16.11]I'm probably not gonna switch servers, for some of you guys asking, only because Star is in here.
[62:20.50]And I wouldn't want it to be like, oh, we both can't get into the same server.
[62:23.66]And plus, I'm on my server, so... I like playing on my server, because I like playing with the dudes on my server, because they're cool.
[62:33.11]For one more, we say.
[62:35.61]Let's go to... No, no, no, no.
[62:41.07]Let's go to good old Gold Rush.
[62:42.77]No, please, no.
[62:45.95]Alright, fine.
[62:46.93]Hold on, I'm trying to figure out how to do something fun.
[62:58.48]I slapped you.
[62:59.96]I got you.
[63:00.98]You need to rapid fire that.
[63:02.90]Oh, you can do that?
[63:04.06]Yeah, if you just keep mashing the button, you can get slapped so much it, like, pops you up in the air.
[63:08.64]Holds you there.
[63:09.22]Alright, let's go.
[63:11.37]Oh, you're gonna be mad, but I kinda wanna play on Turbine.
[63:16.01]As long as... I don't know, I just wanna jump in.
[63:22.79]Turbine!
[63:23.23]I guess... Turbine has stairs.
[63:30.07]I just love Turbine.
[63:31.35]I love a lot of things, don't I?
[63:33.78]Should've played 2-fort.
[63:35.82]2-fort?
[63:36.86]But Turbine's like the good 2-fort, isn't it?
[63:39.96]No, 2-fort is the best 2-fort.
[63:48.46]No, 2-fort is the best 2-fort.
[63:53.23]I'll stick with Demoknight.
[64:00.67]Oh, it's my spray!
[64:02.31]Argh, Jerma!
[64:05.21]This hero now hates you.
[64:06.37]Gary Monster!
[64:07.31]Look what you did.
[64:08.78]What'd I do?
[64:10.96]What'd I do?
[64:13.44]What happened?
[64:13.76]What'd I do?
[64:15.02]You picked this map.
[64:16.86]So?
[64:19.72]There's a ceiling on this map.
[64:22.09]There's nowhere that does not have a ceiling.
[64:24.65]Yeah, but you could do, like, an off-the-wall kind of, like, move, can't you?
[64:33.25]I don't know, I'll ask him.
[64:35.85]Star, are you going to play Diablo 3 as well?
[64:38.63]Yeah, sure.
[64:39.63]Yeah, sure?
[64:41.16]Yeah, sure.
[64:42.36]Team Allianz.
[64:43.60]Okay.
[64:44.46]Oh, I hear a dog.
[64:45.20]I think that might be my dog.
[64:51.36]My dog.
[64:51.75]My dog.
[64:57.36]oh my god a century strategy to turbine hold mid one game oh how are you still here over you makes sense and ok damn it I I was trying I was gonna go for a top kill and I walk into corner why is this response so long I change that
[65:24.90]It's respawn wave time, right?
[65:26.66]You cannot change the respawn on Turbine.
[65:29.47]You can't?
[65:31.37]It's two Turbine.
[65:33.99]You can change the respawn.
[65:35.45]Yes, you can.
[65:35.93]I don't know.
[65:38.59]I have my respawn wave time at two.
[65:41.07]Isn't that supposed to be?
[65:42.30]God, crits.
[65:47.30]Otto's going to bite my ankles in a second.
[65:48.86]He's probably going to run here.
[65:56.69]Oh, come on.
[65:57.37]I want my crits.
[65:58.37]I want my crits.
[66:03.47]Let Grandpa play Diablo?
[66:05.13]I don't think he would get it.
[66:06.94]I think he'd be too confused.
[66:09.18]Because there's too many numbers to deal with in Diablo.
[66:11.32]You don't just, like, shoot people.
[66:12.76]Well, that's why they made numbers off by default and no advanced tooltips.
[66:16.62]It's for people like him.
[66:19.14]What just happened?
[66:22.59]Alright, so I charged with the Chargin' Targe.
[66:25.11]And right when I clicked right click, I got backstabbed and my body just like baseball slid across like the whole map.
[66:33.62]I love getting backstabbed right as you rocket jump and your body just poof, it's gone.
[66:43.74]Boom.
[66:45.62]Okay.
[66:47.72]What do you say, let me find some dude to run into here.
[66:51.81]Here's a Mini-Sentry.
[66:55.47]Help me!
[66:57.63]I'm real, I swear.
[67:01.21]That's a... sticky.
[67:03.67]That's me getting shot.
[67:05.27]Hide right here.
[67:05.75]Shh.
[67:06.05]I know a secret.
[67:06.65]Shh.
[67:07.63]Quiet.
[67:08.11]Here we go.
[67:08.53]This is what you do.
[67:10.63]And then you just... What?
[67:12.03]What?
[67:12.99]I... I was gonna work on my secret technique, and 20 seconds!
[67:18.62]Hold on a minute.
[67:21.51]Oh, actually, I was about to type in the server password.
[67:24.99]Like, hold on, let me just type my Archon password right now in front of, like, 400 people.
[67:30.03]Okay.
[67:30.41]That would be a bad idea.
[67:36.52]20, that's too long.
[67:37.38]20 seconds.
[67:38.06]It's supposed to be, like, 9.
[67:39.48]Come here.
[67:48.34]Oh, there's Turbine.
[67:50.21]Oh, I had to knock back.
[67:52.79]Get over here!
[67:55.65]It is morning.
[67:56.21]It is 9, just about 10 AM here in the East Coast, United States.
[68:06.98]Oh, I've got it!
[68:09.43]I thought I... Oh, he only had like 2% health left.
[68:11.51]10%, 20%, whatever.
[68:21.48]I killed a guy.
[68:22.86]This is why we can't have nice things.
[68:27.83]Please, Jermo, just please, one two-fourth.
[68:31.95]I think two-fourth is... Maybe I took it out of the rotation.
[68:34.59]Alright, how about this?
[68:36.29]Before I leave, I will switch the map to two-fourth.
[68:39.31]How does that sound?
[68:40.87]That does not sound good.
[68:42.83]For this guy, it does.
[68:45.91]Oh my god.
[68:47.69]That guy did not know that was coming.
[68:50.99]Yeah, he was too busy hitting me.
[68:56.84]Remember, if you crouch and just stand still when you're in a melee fight, one-on-one, you're probably going to win.
[69:02.42]Because people freak out too much.
[69:03.68]They run around, they go, what is this?
[69:06.86]And, hey, open that door.
[69:07.92]Whoa.
[69:09.70]I'm going to get the intelligence, you know what?
[69:11.08]Screw this.
[69:13.36]Oh, never mind, he already got it.
[69:14.90]Good job, Scout.
[69:17.89]Good job, dear.
[69:20.77]You type 25 comments and haven't gotten a cheeseburger yet?
[69:23.75]I think there's a YouTube bug.
[69:25.49]You should have already gotten at least three cheeseburgers dispensed from your laptop.
[69:28.73]How are you reading the stream?
[69:32.17]How do you do that?
[69:35.59]It's an, uh... It's just, you make... I'm sorry, I can't even speak.
[69:41.59]Too much stuff going on.
[69:44.87]You just do update comments automatically, and they'll come in as they come in.
[69:51.60]I think there's still, like, a minute or so behind, though, that's the thing with YouTube.
[69:56.15]This isn't even pro-turbine.
[69:58.31]There's no banana.
[70:00.21]Pro-turbine?
[70:02.77]Yeah.
[70:04.19]In pro-turbine, there's a banana.
[70:05.49]Is there really?
[70:09.41]Well, they call it a banana, but it's like a different path on the side.
[70:11.75]It's shaped like a banana.
[70:15.09]Yeah, you should get a double cheeseburger.
[70:17.23]It should come out of your, uh... out of your CD tray.
[70:23.42]Every 25 comments that you make on the stream, a double cheeseburger from your favorite restaurant comes out of your CD tray.
[70:31.84]I don't have a CD tray.
[70:32.90]That is probably why it's not working.
[70:34.39]Yeah.
[70:34.81]If you don't have a CD tray... Oh, a zip drive, too.
[70:37.27]You have to have, like, a zip drive.
[70:40.63]Oh, god!
[70:43.01]Why am I still equipped?
[70:43.91]Why is this still out?
[70:44.79]Why do I still have this out?
[70:45.67]What am I doing?
[70:46.19]I can't believe I got away with that.
[70:49.02]Oh, my god.
[70:49.66]I can't believe I got away with that, either.
[70:52.99]Look at all those people.
[70:56.53]Oh, that was a brigade.
[70:57.53]Uh-oh.
[71:01.63]I'm at the end of my drink.
[71:02.57]You know what that means.
[71:05.99]This thing's, like, floating.
[71:06.83]What the hell?
[71:10.21]Your cheeseburger had blue cheese?
[71:12.33]Sounds pretty dang good.
[71:17.39]Alright, Star.
[71:17.99]You ready?
[71:18.65]I got a question for you.
[71:20.39]Oh, God.
[71:21.67]What is... Aw, it's over.
[71:24.57]One more round.
[71:25.09]We'll do one more.
[71:26.37]Not this map.
[71:26.91]Please.
[71:27.67]Please.
[71:29.73]Alright, fine.
[71:30.53]We'll switch.
[71:33.84]Alright, we'll go to Star.
[71:34.98]Star, what map do you want to play on?
[71:36.88]Jump Tricks.
[71:38.68]You want to play on the jump map?
[71:41.14]I don't even think I have it installed.
[71:43.62]We could play... Alright, it needs to be in the Team Fortress database.
[71:47.87]I'm thinking.
[71:48.27]I'm thinking.
[71:55.09]Frontier.
[71:56.77]Frontier.
[71:58.53]And here we go.
[72:03.85]Your cheeseburger had a green bun.
[72:05.77]That's definitely a defense.
[72:06.39]You were going to ask me a thing.
[72:08.13]Was that the thing?
[72:08.99]Oh yeah, I forgot the thing I was going to ask you.
[72:11.25]Nope, must have been important.
[72:13.33]Probably was really, really important.
[72:17.23]Yeah, one round of Frontier and that'll end the Team Fortress for the day.
[72:21.57]Then I'll move on to Diablo 3 for a little while.
[72:25.83]I was trying to think of good stock payload maps that aren't upward, and my mind just blanked, and I said Frontier.
[72:33.48]Alright, what do you mean?
[72:39.79]Red or blue?
[72:40.93]Let's go blue.
[72:44.47]I'm going to play Medic, because I kind of feel like it.
[72:50.12]I like this setup.
[72:50.88]I'm going to stick with it.
[72:53.45]Except I don't want the... I want the default Medi Gun.
[72:59.55]There we go.
[73:02.98]You gotta keep control of your team.
[73:04.30]You have snipers humping the door.
[73:05.98]What is this?
[73:10.30]Spray!
[73:16.99]Mission begins in 500 seconds.
[73:19.91]That would be nice.
[73:25.59]There's a sign out here that says speed limit 15.
[73:27.51]Speed limit 15?
[73:29.48]Pow.
[73:29.58]5, 4, 3...
[73:45.89]So have you guys been able to hear the in-game audio, like the explosions and stuff?
[73:51.75]Or has that been too low?
[73:53.27]I'm always so afraid to turn that up, because I feel like it's going to overpower everything I say.
[74:00.83]Doctor!
[74:02.43]I think I'm going to get crits, which is perfect, because then how could I possibly miss a market card?
[74:09.27]Alright, who am I going to give this to?
[74:11.01]I don't even know.
[74:16.51]We'll go with the, uh... No, he's already doing one.
[74:21.12]Let's go this way.
[74:24.56]Oh, my God!
[74:25.48]Oh, God!
[74:26.18]Oh, God!
[74:29.04]Wow.
[74:31.34]Come here, come here!
[74:33.02]It didn't work.
[74:36.12]We're good, we're good.
[74:38.26]You're good.
[74:39.64]I'm not.
[74:40.72]Oh, no!
[74:41.60]I was... My hand!
[74:44.18]My right click was... Did you drop Uber?
[74:46.89]My right click was clicking on the uber.
[74:49.15]It was like and I got backstabbed Get on that cat Oh, no, that's you I can't believe that no work Don't even know if it was you because there was like three medics maybe two I can count
[75:17.16]Give me that, Uber.
[75:17.74]Give me that, Uber.
[75:18.76]Alright, I'm not gonna... Oh, now I better watch out.
[75:29.58]I'm doing it right away.
[75:33.31]Come on, Heavy!
[75:36.15]And... Team Uber!
[75:37.95]I'm hiding.
[75:39.03]Everyone is safe now.
[75:43.61]Oh!
[75:48.10]Come on, give me another Ruber.
[75:50.10]Oh god, two spies, that's not going to work.
[75:51.86]I'm in the middle of my head right now.
[75:59.10]Spies, a spy, a spy.
[76:04.14]Help me.
[76:06.14]No, stay alive.
[76:10.32]This guy.
[76:10.86]Oh my god, you are about to die.
[76:16.29]Oh, I had to use it.
[76:17.37]That was really early.
[76:19.99]I'm ashamed to say I know you.
[76:21.83]This guy... Oh, yeah, well, look what we just did.
[76:25.12]We just came up here.
[76:27.24]We did a good job.
[76:29.46]Well, I saw this guy only had, like, 1% health.
[76:32.42]And if I didn't use it, he would have died.
[76:33.62]And it was only me and a sniper behind him, so... When will the next Grandpa video be uploaded?
[76:39.59]It was uploaded last night.
[76:41.47]Machinima Respawn.
[76:42.59]It's on the featured video list.
[76:43.85]Go check it out.
[76:48.59]Actually, to be honest, I'm sorry.
[76:49.97]I didn't even let anybody know that was there.
[76:52.55]I'll do that today.
[76:54.35]After this is over.
[77:04.78]This is bad.
[77:07.14]The tension.
[77:09.64]I guess I do have two kills.
[77:12.68]No, come here, Mark.
[77:14.64]Let me hear you.
[77:19.62]Oh, backed up into a knife.
[77:26.39]Somebody wants me to say a dirty word.
[77:29.95]Hidden.
[77:30.87]Hidden.
[77:32.27]It's hidden in like a regular sentence.
[77:35.39]I know that.
[77:35.87]I know that trick.
[77:37.05]That's a dirty trick.
[77:44.28]If your chat is frozen, try and re-refresh the page.
[77:47.54]Re-exec.
[77:49.43]Wait, what did you say?
[77:52.01]Re-exect the config.
[77:54.89]I need health.
[78:00.31]I need you to heal me.
[78:01.63]Please.
[78:06.77]Oh, this thing is so good.
[78:07.85]I love this thing.
[78:09.87]Doesn't seem like much.
[78:11.24]What?
[78:11.52]The overdose?
[78:12.20]Doesn't seem like much, but it is.
[78:15.90]It really helps in situations.
[78:18.92]A lot of situations it helps.
[78:21.48]It's not that much.
[78:22.20]It is, though.
[78:23.64]What you need is the Bootsauger.
[78:27.06]Yeah, but then you start to take damage.
[78:28.52]Like, you don't get the full plus three.
[78:30.44]Yeah, well, you just have to make sure you hit every needle.
[78:33.51]But that's too hard, and you are gonna land right on my face.
[78:36.15]No, if you're gonna back up like a punk, you're not gonna.
[78:40.87]Like, what, you don't wanna die?
[78:43.01]See, look, I'm running fast.
[78:47.49]I'm going to back up like a punk.
[78:51.87]Alright, I'm going for a team Uber right here.
[78:54.69]We got to push up.
[78:55.55]It's not going to be a single man effort right now.
[78:59.27]Oh, no.
[79:00.62]Oh, did I just totally block you from that?
[79:02.36]I actually apologize if I did.
[79:06.20]I probably would have missed anyway.
[79:10.06]I'm missing like every swing.
[79:11.98]Giving you Uber sauce.
[79:14.28]Oh, no.
[79:15.93]No, I don't want him to die.
[79:20.26]That's a spy!
[79:20.98]That's a spy!
[79:21.52]That's a spy!
[79:22.08]It definitely is!
[79:22.98]No, it's not.
[79:23.46]Get on this thing.
[79:31.56]Be careful.
[79:32.34]I thought that was a spy.
[79:39.06]No!
[79:39.58]Not that!
[79:40.44]Anything but the Uleful Caber.
[79:44.09]Anything but the Uleful Caber.
[79:46.47]Come here, Scout.
[79:46.99]Come here, don't run away!
[79:53.56]Oh, everybody needs health, and there's nothing I can... Oh, watch it!
[79:57.24]Don't die!
[79:57.78]There's a guy behind you!
[80:03.03]Oh, push that up.
[80:05.33]Oh, yeah.
[80:07.93]Gotta get on this.
[80:09.43]Oh, this is mini-century.
[80:10.41]Oh, I'm dead.
[80:11.07]Goodbye.
[80:11.59]Goodbye, cruel world.
[80:17.19]You got chicken out of the tray.
[80:18.79]That's not supposed to happen.
[80:21.43]There's only supposed to be cheeseburgers, meat and cheese, with ketchup, onion, mustard... Relish?
[80:29.32]Why am I going this way?
[80:31.86]I always do that.
[80:32.94]On Upward, I always go the wrong way.
[80:34.98]Upward?
[80:36.76]Support the little guy.
[80:37.98]Hashtag.
[80:40.34]That's my philosophy.
[80:43.58]And apparently Grandpa... You guys have a lot of stuff over there.
[80:49.58]You don't even know yet because it's set up like four miles away.
[80:51.92]You need the time to prepare and put it in a really, really lame sentry spot.
[80:59.73]So prepare for that.
[81:02.87]Lame.
[81:04.87]Lame.
[81:05.73]Everything's lame.
[81:06.39]Oh, I backed up into another knife.
[81:13.14]Backed up.
[81:16.04]Back it up.
[81:28.68]That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh, you are up top there and I'm gonna die.
[81:37.40]Man, these spies are really making me paranoid.
[81:39.81]There's like 40 hundred of them.
[81:43.83]I mean, two.
[81:44.31]There's one back here somewhere.
[81:49.19]Oh, there he is!
[81:49.85]Oh, I was gonna heal that guy, too.
[81:56.62]My god!
[82:00.23]I am not turning my back.
[82:01.58]I'm going to face this way the whole time.
[82:03.42]See?
[82:03.78]I knew it.
[82:04.58]Get out of there.
[82:05.80]Oh, Overdose, you are my friend.
[82:08.84]It's all in your mind.
[82:09.70]Yeah, but even if it is all in my mind, it still makes me get that extra mile.
[82:15.71]In your mind.
[82:20.07]Oh my god, I can't hear you all.
[82:21.97]I'm trying.
[82:22.77]Alright, let's push this thing.
[82:31.71]Somebody get up there.
[82:40.07]Somebody get up there.
[82:42.32]There we go, there we go.
[82:43.84]There we go.
[82:45.32]Push, little wagon.
[82:52.33]You prepared for lame sentry?
[82:54.97]Are you mentally ready for this?
[82:58.98]Is there, like, a bunch there?
[83:00.20]It's alright.
[83:02.02]It's alright, Spy.
[83:02.66]I got you.
[83:03.92]I got you.
[83:06.09]I'll make sure you have a nice, thick overheal by the time you get out of here.
[83:10.56]And by the time I'm not afraid to leave.
[83:12.68]Which is right up.
[83:25.99]Oh no!
[83:27.21]No!
[83:27.77]No!
[83:28.35]Heal me!
[83:29.01]Heal me!
[83:29.97]Please!
[83:30.47]Oh, damn it.
[83:32.99]Bomb gun.
[83:37.82]That was a pretty nice run, though.
[83:40.76]I'm proud of that little run.
[83:45.44]Proud.
[83:49.34]People say you should try to pan me.
[83:53.64]I am missing every single Market Garden.
[83:58.20]Oh, that was a glitch.
[84:04.78]Ah, that's fine.
[84:05.64]No, it's not.
[84:07.08]It looks like he's running slower.
[84:08.14]That was weird.
[84:15.51]Got ya.
[84:19.23]Gotta get up.
[84:19.95]Move up, move up.
[84:20.83]No, come here.
[84:22.97]Move that gear up.
[84:25.57]Oh, is there a sentry gun?
[84:29.80]I believe it is.
[84:30.70]We got three medics, too.
[84:31.58]We should be pushing this cart like crazy.
[84:36.12]You need 14 heavies.
[84:37.12]We only have one.
[84:39.06]And there it was.
[84:39.50]There's a spy right there.
[84:40.42]That pyro.
[84:41.14]I'm waiting for him to come over here.
[84:43.51]He has no head, either.
[84:44.67]Where's his head?
[84:46.15]Where's this guy's head?
[84:47.03]Yeah, I've been noticing that a lot lately.
[84:48.77]Is that just on spies?
[84:50.55]Yeah, if a spy disguises as a pyro and they're wearing a certain hat, it can't display the hat.
[84:56.03]Or something like that.
[84:57.37]Oh, god.
[84:57.89]That guy just ubered at the same time as me.
[85:02.56]We just both ubered the same guy at the same time.
[85:04.42]Damn it.
[85:08.62]I'm going for it.
[85:09.26]I'm going for some nutso stuff right here.
[85:10.88]I went on sniper because we had none.
[85:13.32]Now we have three.
[85:18.36]That's a higher number.
[85:19.32]That guy only needed one hit, and I didn't get it.
[85:28.55]What movies, what films am I planning on seeing?
[85:31.85]Probably... I still haven't seen the Avengers.
[85:35.67]I have to see the Avengers.
[85:38.25]Have you seen that star?
[85:39.69]Yep.
[85:40.30]Is it good?
[85:43.66]Yes and no.
[85:45.20]It's good because there's explosions, but I had like a two hour long conversation with someone about why it's terrible.
[85:51.02]Really?
[85:52.85]Just nothing makes sense.
[85:53.83]If you watch it, you need to question everything that happens and say, why is this happening?
[85:58.45]And you will realize, you don't know.
[86:01.31]Nobody knows.
[86:02.20]The Avengers.
[86:06.86]I don't really watch a whole lot of movies, to be honest.
[86:09.70]The Dark Knight.
[86:11.72]Yeah, that's definitely one.
[86:12.58]I mean, you have to see that, though.
[86:17.12]It's pretty much a moral obligation for every human being to watch the Christopher Nolan Batman movies.
[86:27.76]You know you're Ubering a spy?
[86:28.87]Yeah, I know.
[86:30.93]I'm aware of that.
[86:31.71]I realized that about two or three seconds into that Uber.
[86:36.15]I just thought I'd let you know.
[86:37.29]Yeah, I realized it.
[86:39.03]Especially when he ran the other direction, when I ubered him and he turned left and went backwards.
[86:43.61]I was like, wait, it fights that way.
[86:45.39]What are you doing?
[86:48.81]You could just have uberphobia.
[86:51.12]Good.
[86:55.30]Do I really need books?
[86:56.82]I do not.
[86:57.18]I don't really.
[86:58.38]Actually, I take that back.
[87:00.44]I read sometimes.
[87:02.50]I read, like, graphic novels.
[87:04.64]Does that count?
[87:07.01]That does not count.
[87:07.71]But there's words in there.
[87:08.49]Unless they're good ones.
[87:10.59]Doug TenNapel makes good ones.
[87:19.48]Doug TenNapel makes great, great graphic novels.
[87:23.54]The Earthworm Jimmy guy.
[87:26.24]I didn't know he did that.
[87:28.70]Yeah, they're pretty good.
[87:30.94]At least the art is very, very interesting and really awesome.
[87:39.37]I got you.
[87:39.97]I got you, Ballin' Colin.
[87:46.93]You need help more than anybody.
[87:48.15]I'll make sure to get you.
[87:50.74]Oh my god!
[87:51.92]Alright, you know what?
[87:53.48]No more medic.
[87:55.22]It is pyro time.
[87:56.54]Wanna see my backpack?
[87:58.18]Here you go.
[88:00.40]It's kind of all over the place right now, ever since I gave everything away.
[88:04.15]I don't have any more, like, cool hats.
[88:07.97]Okay, I should stop doing this and actually shoot bullets.
[88:18.18]I gotta take that teleport.
[88:19.14]What am I doing?
[88:23.34]Spies!
[88:25.80]Spies are no match for the pyro.
[88:34.83]Except sometimes.
[88:37.25]No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[88:42.55]Oh, come on!
[88:43.35]Where did he even come from?
[88:46.41]I have zero unusuals.
[88:49.34]Bad player.
[88:50.00]Yeah, I don't know how you guys aren't winning more.
[89:02.91]Well, we only have one minute.
[89:05.54]That's pretty much the end right there.
[89:08.67]Do I still like the gorillas?
[89:09.81]Oh my god, yes.
[89:14.85]Gorillas are the best band, like, ever.
[89:19.06]We're not gonna win this.
[89:20.94]Too much... Too much good stuff happening.
[89:24.06]Oh, there's a sentry.
[89:24.76]We lost.
[89:25.30]It's over.
[89:26.68]It is over.
[89:28.67]So, in that case, you know, you always gotta do this.
[89:30.81]You always gotta go spy the skies as an enemy heavy or something.
[89:35.79]Oh, you know what?
[89:37.11]I'm gonna play.
[89:37.47]I'm gonna go scout just so I can run away.
[89:40.36]I'm gonna take the coward way out.
[89:43.86]Why am I taking the teleporter?
[89:44.76]Where does this go?
[89:46.90]So, this is where we transition.
[89:49.12]What?
[89:49.32]Oh, wait.
[89:50.14]Can we maybe?
[89:50.80]You spy!
[89:54.58]I think?
[89:55.24]No, our Syndra's still helpful.
[89:58.19]Ah, it's death.
[89:59.39]Yeah, it's over.
[90:01.55]It's over.
[90:03.17]Time to move on to some Diablo 3.
[90:04.79]Oh my god, are we gonna find items?
[90:08.99]Or gold?
[90:10.13]Uh, hopefully gold, because I need more.
[90:13.66]No, we lost!
[90:14.24]Yeah, just please, I hope I don't find any items, just gold.
[90:17.12]I can't believe we lost the game.
[90:19.50]Alright, well thanks guys for playing, if you got in, thank you.
[90:24.15]And time to transition to Diablo 3.
[90:25.77]If you just came, if you're wondering, oh, but it's over, no.
[90:28.61]This is all going to be on YouTube later on today.
[90:32.01]Yeah.
[90:33.35]Thanks for playing, dudes.
[90:34.59]Let's go on to Diablo 3.
[90:35.66]This is where we go.
[90:39.38]Disconnect.
[90:41.84]Disconnect.
[90:43.60]Yes.
[90:44.12]Oh, are you sure?
[90:44.80]I don't know.
[90:45.22]I have replays I don't want to lose.
[90:46.87]Alright, now.
[90:50.69]Diablo.
[90:51.45]Fwee.
[90:58.69]Super Monday Night Combat, I can't get into it.
[91:03.45]I don't know what it is.
[91:04.39]I'm not sure.
[91:05.35]I have a couple of friends now that are really starting to enjoy it, but I just can't.
[91:09.61]I don't know why.
[91:10.99]They did just add a new game mode, which is weird.
[91:13.75]It's kind of like realism, I guess, where everybody dies quicker.
[91:18.66]Really?
[91:21.22]Yeah.
[91:23.84]I need to get into it at some point.
[91:25.35]Maybe.
[91:25.73]I'm not sure yet.
[91:26.99]Is this even in the right spot?
[91:28.19]I think it is.
[91:29.81]Not quite.
[91:30.31]Hold on.
[91:33.29]Screen's got to go black for a second, dudes.
[91:36.61]You can even rocket jump in that game.
[91:38.67]And I still don't like it that much.
[91:45.21]I don't know what else there could be to encourage me to play.
[91:49.40]Maybe hats?
[91:52.86]There are hats.
[91:54.72]Then yeah, that's a good way to play.
[91:57.48]Screen region, Diablo 3.
[92:04.96]You know you can stream with DxStory.
[92:07.44]And it's better.
[92:08.40]In screen region.
[92:10.08]Really?
[92:10.98]Yeah.
[92:11.30]Whoa, streamception.
[92:13.22]Oh my god.
[92:16.54]Do you use DxStory?
[92:18.24]Oh yeah, you do.
[92:19.82]I don't stream with it though.
[92:21.75]You should.
[92:22.47]Oh my good god.
[92:23.83]Every time I try to bring this stupid window up.
[92:26.53]It'll be magic.
[92:28.37]Alright, I'm gonna try this one more time because this is being ridiculous.
[92:33.12]Okay.
[92:35.50]Streamception mania.
[92:37.26]That was just like... I felt like I was looking through a tunnel right there.
[92:40.76]I'm gonna like puke.
[92:42.86]Okay.
[92:43.52]The love of everything that is sacred.
[92:46.00]Can we get this in the right spot?
[92:49.76]Yes, we can.
[92:50.28]Dxtory.
[92:50.74]I'm telling you.
[92:52.66]But Dxtory is expensive.
[92:55.66]No, okay, that's good enough.
[92:57.38]Good enough.
[92:59.86]Good enough.
[93:05.11]Alright.
[93:05.87]Nobody, like, steal my password.
[93:12.39]Stolen.
[93:13.83]Hacked.
[93:14.61]Nobody steal my stuff.
[93:16.65]Because I have, like, really good stuff.
[93:18.39]No, I don't.
[93:22.39]Alright, I'm on Nightmare.
[93:23.73]Oh, you like my witch doctor name?
[93:26.01]Burglar?
[93:28.19]He's the Burglar.
[93:31.41]Are you and I in a game?
[93:33.77]I'm not in a game.
[93:35.33]I'm on Act 3, Nightmare.
[93:38.43]No, that's... I'm further than that.
[93:41.79]Well, you have to come help me.
[93:43.79]Okay.
[93:44.29]You have to.
[93:45.61]Okay.
[93:46.31]Are you sure you don't want to just kill Asmodean 4,000 times?
[93:50.99]That's what I've been doing.
[93:52.95]We're going to make this game where you don't have to run the same bosses over and over again.
[94:00.03]We're going to make Asmodan give you all the experience.
[94:02.85]Every single cent of experience I want in my bank account.
[94:06.93]Hold on, I've got to get over the Diablo 3 lag for the first two minutes.
[94:10.48]I'm just doing random moves.
[94:12.36]There's got to be a reason why that happens.
[94:15.34]It has to be because it's syncing you up with the DRM or something like that.
[94:19.24]It has to be.
[94:21.21]I don't know, but you need to invite me.
[94:23.55]Oh, that's right.
[94:30.36]Invite to the party.
[94:31.78]Yeah, and now I'm gonna reject it and be cool.
[94:34.04]Oh, but please be my friend.
[94:37.00]Nah.
[94:37.52]The turd burglar.
[94:43.00]The turd burglar.
[94:44.74]I made his name Burglar because of, like, Burgah Boy.
[94:53.70]Oh yeah, the lags.
[94:56.40]Yeah, you gotta get rid of the initial lag of Diablo 3.
[95:03.53]Woohoo, hooray!
[95:04.57]Alright, I think we can do it.
[95:11.83]Well, the reason why it lags is even when I'm not streaming, when I'm just playing just by myself, the first two or three minutes every time you play Diablo 3, for some reason, it just does this.
[95:21.76]Yeah, do a new move and it's like, wait, what is this?
[95:24.26]You didn't load Diablo 3 or anything.
[95:26.60]It's sort of like Minecraft.
[95:28.36]That's the only way I can really make an assumption to what it's kind of like.
[95:32.40]You know how Minecraft is like when you first start playing, it's like, loading every single thing in the world.
[95:36.49]See, like, I have to load all this stuff.
[95:39.73]It'll even out in a minute, I promise.
[95:43.60]Oh, I did love a lot more than you.
[95:44.92]I didn't even... Oh, no, I'm still lagging.
[95:51.19]You know what's a good game?
[95:54.61]Medium pizza?
[95:55.57]Medium-large cheese pizza?
[95:56.85]Yes.
[95:57.09]I love pizza.
[96:00.85]Let's go.
[96:01.35]Let's go with the lag.
[96:03.20]Alright.
[96:08.72]I want to get some rares and some uniques.
[96:13.60]Hold on, people are still seeing streamception?
[96:15.44]No, they're not.
[96:16.64]Or is that just an old comment from somebody from a while back?
[96:18.80]I don't shoot arrows anymore.
[96:26.52]Hold on a second, what's going on?
[96:27.95]People are sitting there seeing... Shouldn't be.
[96:31.05]Hold on, let me watch my own stream.
[96:34.85]Make sure nothing's happening.
[96:37.50]You should stream with DxStory.
[96:39.40]I gave the recommendation.
[96:41.27]I should stream with DxStory.
[96:43.59]Teach you in two seconds.
[96:44.89]Every time I stream, when I did the XSplit game stream thing, for some reason, I don't know why, it lags.
[96:53.07]It lags really, really terribly.
[96:55.29]Oh, no, we're not getting streamception.
[96:57.69]Looks okay.
[96:59.51]What about 720?
[97:00.07]That looks okay, too.
[97:04.01]Okay.
[97:05.58]Just making sure nothing was happening.
[97:08.50]It's probably the YouTube comment system, like, all slow and dumb.
[97:11.02]Because that's what it is.
[97:12.54]Probs.
[97:20.20]So I'm playing Witch Doctor.
[97:23.74]Witch Doctor is very fun.
[97:26.08]Very good, very cool.
[97:30.95]I am shooting bombs.
[97:33.43]Bombs?
[97:35.43]There's actually a pretty cool build with Demon Hunter I found out that
[97:38.05]We just regenerate hatred like ridiculous amounts of it.
[97:41.77]We could use Cluster Arrow non-stop.
[97:44.42]Really?
[97:44.64]Cluster Arrow is amazing.
[97:45.46]Sounds pretty cool.
[97:47.62]Pretty damn cool.
[97:49.36]Pretty snazzy.
[97:50.90]Pretty snazzy.
[97:53.84]This guy's an elite in these.
[97:56.24]Did he kill my little buddy?
[97:57.66]Oh, he's back.
[97:58.10]Don't worry.
[98:02.24]I have a feeling maybe I shouldn't even be helping you.
[98:04.95]Why?
[98:06.10]I don't know.
[98:06.52]I've got 5300 damage.
[98:08.40]It feels wrong.
[98:11.90]But I need the help.
[98:16.45]Get out of here.
[98:18.37]Already a rare.
[98:19.67]Really?
[98:19.91]I didn't think this would happen.
[98:21.59]I thought it was just going to be the sea of blue.
[98:23.78]But I want one.
[98:26.05]What do I think of the Spider-Man reboot?
[98:28.75]I think it's, um... Not out yet.
[98:31.16]Well, yeah, it's not out.
[98:32.40]I mean, I don't know.
[98:34.20]I thought it was going to be like a Christopher Nolan type reboot, but it's kind of... Everything's like all CGI-y and stuff.
[98:41.51]I don't want to see it, but...
[98:45.52]I don't know, man.
[98:46.16]I'll probably see it.
[98:46.66]They just did this one.
[98:47.26]Why don't they just do something else?
[98:48.86]Leave Spider-Man alone.
[98:50.03]Leave Spider-Man alone.
[98:51.79]I'll probably watch it, to be honest.
[98:53.09]I was a big Spider-Man fan.
[98:54.51]I loved the first movie.
[98:55.81]The second one was good, too.
[99:00.06]Oh, get away.
[99:01.30]Hopefully, this time, they do anything with Venom, even later on.
[99:04.72]Hopefully, he's not, like, a total D-bag or anything like that.
[99:10.60]Venom.
[99:13.14]I have a cool face and giant teeth, but I pull my mask back to talk.
[99:18.25]Thanks.
[99:18.65]Yeah, I didn't really like the way they handled Venom either.
[99:21.21]It was kind of lackluster.
[99:22.37]I'm mad at you because you took my girlfriend or something.
[99:25.43]I don't even remember what his deal was.
[99:27.35]Wasn't he also only in the movie for like 25 minutes, the actual Venom symbiote monster thing?
[99:35.38]It's less than that.
[99:38.16]And the way he beats them, it's like, why you gotta humiliate a guy like that?
[99:42.09]Why you gotta be like that?
[99:46.27]I thought you were a good guy, Spider-Man.
[99:55.35]If you guys wanna see my runes, I'll give you a little look-see.
[99:59.91]Look-see-doo.
[100:02.42]So this is poison, I'm using poison dart and fire bats.
[100:05.71]And I have it so it's just pretty much pure damage.
[100:10.15]So if you take a look, poison dart I have it so it's on the fire one.
[100:13.43]So it just does more just straight up damage every time you hit somebody.
[100:16.42]I just leveled up apparently.
[100:18.78]Oh, I'm sorry.
[100:20.32]I'm sorry.
[100:21.56]Then fire bats, I have the poison ones.
[100:23.78]Actually, I got a new one.
[100:25.69]I have ferrets.
[100:26.73]Hmm.
[100:27.69]I'll stick with the poison ones for now, I think.
[100:31.10]Ferrets?
[100:32.02]Yeah.
[100:32.80]I got the gargantuan, the one that goes crazy when there's more than a few people around.
[100:36.46]Yeah.
[100:37.46]Yeah.
[100:38.82]I got... Oh, yeah.
[100:41.34]Soul Harvest, because it is just too good to not have.
[100:44.74]How much intelligence is it giving you now?
[100:47.72]102 for every enemy affected.
[100:49.42]So I can get 550 in intelligence if I get five people.
[100:55.39]Oh, that's a lot.
[100:57.59]Mass Confusion and then Spirit Walk.
[100:59.08]Mass Confusion makes everyone hit themselves, pretty much.
[101:01.98]And Spirit Walk is just amazing, because it makes you pretty much unkillable.
[101:06.46]You just go like this, you go, and you run around.
[101:09.84]Very, very awesome.
[101:12.48]Do you have ferrets?
[101:14.70]I don't have ferrets.
[101:15.66]Let me turn on my... Ferrets.
[101:18.12]Make this a little... My GPU fan a little higher.
[101:23.52]Yike.
[101:24.24]Okay.
[101:26.00]Just to make sure.
[101:27.04]Alright, we gotta go, we gotta find... This is the spider lady, isn't it?
[101:37.22]Um... Yeah.
[101:40.80]She's down a ways still.
[101:42.56]Yeah, we missed her.
[101:44.61]We missed her.
[101:45.23]Alright, if you were just here for the TF2, then take it easy, man.
[101:49.73]Thanks for coming.
[101:54.97]me this gold my ferrets they pick up gold for me do they really the most yeah the most important skill in the game it's pick up gold that is a really important skill because you have to like go move over and run over it and they increase gold fine just for being ferrets like I didn't know ferrets did that but they're rolling in it rolling in those ferrets so we went the wrong way
[102:26.21]It's Diablo 3.
[102:28.23]That's the name of the game in D3.
[102:29.85]Going the wrong way.
[102:31.39]It almost feels sometimes like it generates the map as you go somewhere.
[102:36.51]He went this way, let's generate it so it's the wrong way every time.
[102:40.45]So many little spider freaks.
[102:42.51]Oh god.
[102:42.89]Come on, go get him Gargantuan.
[102:48.15]So we were talking about the gargantuan, this little buddy that I have for a pet.
[102:54.54]And we came to the conclusion that this is what he's doing.
[102:57.20]So I'll try and do the voice.
[102:59.92]I'll definitely get it through this fight.
[103:04.68]So ready?
[103:05.78]So this is, look at how cute he is.
[103:08.09]So already he's just like...
[103:10.48]That's the noise he's making when he runs.
[103:18.83]And he's got a diaper.
[103:21.77]I hit this guy, I help you.
[103:24.91]Ow, that hurts!
[103:27.03]I know.
[103:27.75]I just feel like he's a big, dumb, cute... I'm gonna die as an elite right here.
[103:33.81]It's okay.
[103:35.89]I'll hold you.
[103:37.33]Yikes.
[103:42.49]Confusion.
[103:43.13]Alright, let's get a rare.
[103:46.75]So, yeah, I thought I had a really cool skill that could rival your mass confusion because it knocks everything back for, like, 10 seconds.
[103:54.50]Really?
[103:54.80]It doesn't work on rares.
[103:57.18]Really?
[103:57.50]Like, all rares are immune to knockback.
[103:59.82]That's kind of BS.
[104:02.14]Yeah, I was kind of going to go, like, all knockback Demon Hunter because Diablo II.
[104:08.13]Mm-hmm.
[104:09.91]I probably still am, but it just kind of sucks that rares are going to be like, it's okay.
[104:14.42]You might get one.
[104:14.94]I'm going to back up a little bit.
[104:26.40]Jeremy, can you make a shout out to Edgel?
[104:28.70]Like in the stream?
[104:29.50]Just say your name.
[104:31.40]What's up, Edgel?
[104:34.44]I think it's pronounced Edgel.
[104:36.51]EGLE?
[104:36.63]EGLE WAFFLES? EGLE WAFFLES? EGLE WAFFLES?
[105:09.73]I did not need to know that about you.
[105:13.57]I don't think anyone needed to know that about you.
[105:15.17]I think everyone is leaving the stream right now.
[105:18.67]Because I said that.
[105:21.67]What's the point of watching this if this guy doesn't even like pancakes?
[105:25.90]I thought we could bond on some sort of human level, but apparently not.
[105:30.32]I thought we were going to be friends.
[105:37.17]Why would I want to be friends with you now?
[105:38.55]I need health.
[105:39.17]Do I have any potions that I'm not using?
[105:42.05]I gotta run back to town real quick.
[105:45.23]You don't like pancakes?
[105:46.27]Unsubbed.
[105:47.69]No, I love pancakes!
[105:48.51]Come back!
[105:50.34]I was only joking.
[105:52.62]You know, the only pancakes I like are chocolate chip pancakes.
[105:57.22]That's it.
[105:59.54]Everything else I'm not a big fan of.
[106:01.24]Are you just trying to run your name into the ground?
[106:04.28]Chocolate chip pancakes are really good.
[106:05.80]What's wrong with that?
[106:07.74]Chocolate chip pancakes.
[106:09.88]This is a breakfast food we were talking about.
[106:12.22]You want to put chocolate chips in them.
[106:14.46]Would you put chocolate chips and scrambled eggs and be like, ah, good idea?
[106:19.40]Yeah, but scrambled eggs are like eggs.
[106:22.00]They're not like... Pancakes are sweet.
[106:27.32]Let me give you a rebuttal.
[106:28.14]Would you put cheese on your pancakes?
[106:31.78]I'm sure that wouldn't be that bad.
[106:33.53]I don't think so.
[106:34.57]I don't know about that.
[106:36.71]What does cheese go badly with?
[106:38.93]Besides chocolate chips.
[106:40.97]Like a glass of chocolate milk?
[106:42.76]If you put easy cheese in it?
[106:43.94]Well, besides anything chocolate.
[106:50.10]Well, when does chocolate go bad?
[106:52.18]You just made my point for me.
[106:57.44]I'm trying to say chocolate doesn't go with anything.
[106:59.82]You just eat chocolate.
[107:02.75]chocolate chocolate ice cream chocolate milkshake chocolate strawberries yet other all but the point is I'm re I decided to go back to town again because I forgot I want you to buy potions and I didn't chocolate chip pancakes that's the best part about the other three
[107:29.38]Is there time to consider the important parts of life?
[107:32.48]We weren't talking about this when playing TF2, but now we're down to the root.
[107:37.12]Now it's a little more laid back.
[107:38.54]We get some time to discuss things.
[107:40.30]Laid back?
[107:41.68]It's a little more laid back.
[107:43.00]I would consider this more serious.
[107:46.52]This is so serious.
[107:47.83]It's Diablo.
[107:51.43]Here I am clicking on things, and you're in town clicking on things.
[107:54.05]This is the most serious thing I've ever done in my life.
[107:56.31]Oh, snake.
[107:56.91]Oh, well, whatever.
[107:57.45]I'm just going to come meet you.
[108:01.50]Yeah, this is Act 3 Nightmare, if you guys are wondering.
[108:04.22]This is the character.
[108:05.00]I don't have this character in Hell.
[108:06.00]He's only 46.
[108:07.22]He's little.
[108:08.82]And you are ahead.
[108:10.14]I need to come up and find you.
[108:11.74]Yeah, I figured you'd spawn on me.
[108:13.95]Well, I don't assume that I'm that intelligent.
[108:18.19]Okay, sorry.
[108:21.67]I've never been to Comic Con.
[108:23.85]I want to go.
[108:24.37]It'd be really fun.
[108:26.43]Oh, and there's an Elite right there.
[108:27.67]Not cool.
[108:28.91]Yeah, that guy is neat.
[108:32.95]Comic Con is really interesting because it's... Isn't Comic Con not just like comics?
[108:37.39]It's pretty much about everything, isn't it?
[108:40.81]Kind of a little bit of everything.
[108:41.91]They have a lot of movie stuff there too.
[108:43.64]I don't know.
[108:47.84]I could have gone once, but I didn't.
[108:50.50]I might go to one eventually.
[108:52.96]There's one in New York, right?
[108:54.54]New York and in Chicago.
[108:58.96]I'd probably go to the New York one, if I had the chance, if I had, like, the money.
[109:02.62]See, that's the most important thing.
[109:04.30]Going to all these events, it costs money.
[109:06.37]And that's just money that I don't have.
[109:07.71]Ooh, my Gargantuan.
[109:16.90]I need more health.
[109:19.24]I only have, like, 11,000 or so.
[109:19.90]I have 12,000.
[109:24.04]Somebody wants to know if you're gonna... Oh god, Treasure Goblin, really?
[109:28.82]Get him, get him.
[109:31.16]No, no, no, this is not good at all.
[109:33.86]Mass Confusion, get him.
[109:35.74]Oh god, this is just chaos.
[109:38.72]He's dead.
[109:39.68]Oh, and he dropped a rare.
[109:42.05]Yay, nightmare rare.
[109:44.33]Oh, I'm about to die.
[109:46.19]Oh, run away, run away, run away.
[109:47.41]Run away.
[109:50.15]Totally fair.
[109:50.97]I'm gonna jail you and then mortar you.
[109:54.55]So what I was going to say is somebody wants to know if you're going to continue your Let's Play.
[109:59.96]They want to know because they want to see the whole story they said.
[110:03.14]Oh, of Diablo 3?
[110:04.10]Yeah.
[110:04.71]I was going to upload one last night.
[110:05.99]Actually, I did upload one, but apparently it never finished rendering.
[110:09.33]So it was like a fourth of a video.
[110:12.93]That's the worst thing.
[110:13.65]See, this video, right when this stream is done, once it gets uploaded to YouTube, it is going to take like two hours to process.
[110:21.46]It's just like... I wish there was a way... We did a full circle.
[110:27.06]We did, but we need XP.
[110:28.74]And we need items.
[110:29.60]I didn't even identify the... Oh, this is a one-hander.
[110:36.76]There's no dexterity on it, though.
[110:38.53]But this is actually pretty good.
[110:41.27]Oh, hey, I have this thing that I found.
[110:43.23]It's a blue, so you know it's good.
[110:45.69]Go over here.
[110:46.91]Do you want to look at this?
[110:47.87]Is this thing better than what you have?
[110:50.57]I mean, you could maybe use that.
[110:53.69]Oh, jeez.
[110:55.23]That thing is not better?
[110:57.19]I will sell it.
[110:59.93]I'm going to be losing 2,000 life if I put this on, but I'm going to gain a ton of damage.
[111:09.59]Damage, always need damage.
[111:12.65]That's 2,000 health I'm gonna lose, but you know what?
[111:15.53]It's worth it to do almost 1,000 more damage.
[111:17.81]Yeah, it's all blue.
[111:21.78]We'll do it.
[111:22.92]Yeah, we'll do it.
[111:24.18]And temporarily, I'm just gonna put this gem into it.
[111:30.88]Alright.
[111:31.94]Lost a bunch of health, so I'm gonna be an absolute wuss.
[111:35.58]I have pants, too.
[111:36.40]Maybe you want pants.
[111:38.72]Pants?
[111:39.42]I don't need pants.
[111:40.92]Or do I?
[111:43.74]Oh god, this is way better than what I have.
[111:46.35]Again, I'm going to be losing health.
[111:48.97]Oh.
[111:49.85]Oh well.
[111:50.27]I'm losing health.
[111:53.07]Who cares?
[111:57.54]Put this in there for now.
[111:59.08]Just to have it in there for now.
[112:01.96]Alright.
[112:03.08]What's that?
[112:04.36]What's all this?
[112:05.36]What are you dropping?
[112:06.04]I want to look.
[112:07.76]Imagine if this is what Diablo 3 was, where you just stand in place and items fall.
[112:11.60]What's this?
[112:12.50]No, what's that?
[112:13.58]What's this?
[112:14.30]What's this?
[112:15.08]There's magic in the air.
[112:16.46]What's this?
[112:17.21]What's this?
[112:17.61]Alright, 20 Jerma points to whoever figures out what that song is from.
[112:22.53]That's a difficult one.
[112:25.35]And remember what you can buy with Jerma points.
[112:30.24]I don't think anything, to be honest.
[112:32.38]You can still buy a salad.
[112:34.18]You can buy a Jerma salad for 15 Jerma points.
[112:40.47]Don't sell it, Jerma.
[112:41.27]Give it to me.
[112:41.73]There's probably chocolate chips in the Jerma salad.
[112:44.38]I don't know if people want it.
[112:45.66]You know, I can't believe that you don't like chocolate chip pancakes.
[112:50.10]That's unbelievable.
[112:52.02]I've never actually had them, just because the thought of that is absolutely disgusting.
[112:55.11]Ooh, rare.
[112:55.55]What?
[112:57.53]Disgusting?
[112:58.43]Chocolate chip pancakes.
[113:00.07]Oh, this is an offhand.
[113:01.01]Hold on.
[113:01.51]Oh, man.
[113:02.85]Oh, man.
[113:05.89]Gosh, gee, golly.
[113:07.17]Oh, I can't.
[113:07.61]I don't have time to look at that, but I think it's better.
[113:10.87]I'm a witch doctor.
[113:12.47]I am a witch doctor.
[113:15.09]Star is a demon hunter.
[113:17.23]And we're two best friends in Diablo 3.
[113:19.75]I hunt demons, except sometimes they help me.
[113:24.77]Makes sense.
[113:26.03]Makes sense.
[113:29.95]The bones.
[113:35.89]I carry a bow and... Confusion!
[113:37.93]Mass confusion!
[113:38.95]Everyone starts fighting each other.
[113:42.59]Oh my god!
[113:43.63]Too much!
[113:45.94]It's a good thing you don't have that health.
[113:48.96]Good thing.
[113:49.34]I could need it.
[113:51.46]I could need it?
[113:52.00]I could use it.
[113:54.24]Oh, we got an Elite.
[113:55.46]Watch out.
[113:55.92]We got an Elite!
[113:57.41]And he's got that pull move, and he slows you down.
[113:59.83]That's just fantastic.
[114:01.53]He did.
[114:08.30]He has all the things.
[114:09.61]He dropped a rrrr.
[114:11.63]Yeah, those of you that said Nightmare Before Christmas, you are a winner.
[114:16.25]You get my... I'm going to put my hand up to the screen right now and it's a high five.
[114:20.67]Hey, punk.
[114:22.69]Punk, where you go?
[114:25.76]What's that?
[114:28.82]Where do you keep finding these things?
[114:31.42]Down the floor.
[114:32.78]How come I'm not finding these?
[114:35.40]It's way better than what I have.
[114:36.50]Thank you.
[114:38.85]Didn't I just find... So many items, I don't know what to do.
[114:44.28]No, where are the... There it is.
[114:49.62]10 to 23.
[114:50.16]19, 47 intellect.
[114:51.48]It's way better.
[114:52.90]It is way... Ah, critical hit chance, though.
[114:56.35]It's got 2.5% crit on it.
[114:57.97]This does not have it, but... Oh, hey, what's your amulet?
[115:02.33]I'll inspect you.
[115:03.37]I'll inspect you.
[115:04.03]I'm going to put this on.
[115:06.10]I'm going to put a Vitality Gem in that, because I'm under 10k health right now.
[115:10.90]This is awful.
[115:11.42]Check out this amulet and tell me if you're interested.
[115:15.42]You could just have it anyway, I don't care.
[115:20.00]Seriously, you have just replaced six pieces of my gear.
[115:25.42]Okay.
[115:26.70]The critical hit damage, I have a rare on, what do you think?
[115:30.24]30% more crit damage or extra health and a little bit more damage?
[115:34.37]I don't know, how much are you critting with Mass Confusion?
[115:37.07]Um, 10 million?
[115:38.55]I think I'm gonna leave it on, because I do pretty big crits with, uh, Poison Dart.
[115:48.88]It's the treasure gobble.
[116:00.24]Would I recommend getting D3 compared to D2?
[116:05.02]Probably not.
[116:06.06]There is this really good game called, you know, D2.
[116:09.44]I think this is Treasure Goblin.
[116:11.00]Where is he?
[116:11.64]Why is all this money over here?
[116:14.41]Why was that money right there?
[116:15.29]Where's this goblin?
[116:15.79]That was the goblin.
[116:17.71]Oh, you got him.
[116:20.03]Diablo II is one of my favorite games ever made, so I'm very, very biased when it comes to comparing Diablo II and Diablo 3.
[116:28.02]But Diablo II... I mean, this game is awesome.
[116:30.46]I mean, I'm playing it right now.
[116:31.70]I've dumped a ton of time into it.
[116:33.76]But if you were a huge fan of Diablo II, then it's... If you saw, I did a review on this game already.
[116:39.24]It's on the channel, but... It's kind of a letdown in the item department, at least as of right now.
[116:44.88]Apparently, they're going to maybe potentially look at legendaries.
[116:48.49]Because where it stands right now, a legendary item can be potentially worse than a blue.
[116:53.61]Which is... That just shouldn't be happening.
[116:56.97]But for the most part, I mean, if you've never played a Diablo game, this is a perfect time to get into it, because this game is just very streamlined, it's very fun, very addicting.
[117:06.28]I say yes, go buy it.
[117:07.62]If you've never played Diablo before, and you want to, then check it out, for sure.
[117:12.76]It's awesome.
[117:18.05]Star, oh god.
[117:19.29]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[117:20.41]Too many balloons, too many elites.
[117:23.83]Oh my god, my friend, my gargantuan...
[117:27.15]He died?
[117:28.53]No, he almost did.
[117:30.19]He grew.
[117:31.21]Stabilizers.
[117:33.91]You need to have, like, when you go home with your witch doctor, on the wall, you need to put notches on the wall for how high your gargantuan grows.
[117:41.42]Hold on, I want to look at something real quick.
[117:43.74]Give me one second.
[117:44.60]Okay, I'll hide in corner with you.
[117:46.72]How far behind is the stream?
[117:49.82]Like, the stream, like, I think my 720 stream is, like, seven years behind.
[117:54.51]That happens.
[117:56.14]Hold on, let me take a look at this.
[118:00.82]Because that's like... People are still just answering that Nightmare Before Christmas, and that was like five minutes ago.
[118:08.21]So I want to see just how far back it is.
[118:12.83]Somebody said 15 seconds?
[118:16.63]Actually, you know what?
[118:17.35]The YouTube comment system is probably just bugged like it always is.
[118:20.45]I probably said that before.
[118:21.25]Yeah.
[118:23.70]Why am I watching an ad?
[118:28.87]Adception right there.
[118:34.21]Ads on top of ads on top of ads.
[118:36.81]They're advertising an ad.
[118:38.95]Go watch this ad.
[118:42.53]Please go watch this ad on top of this ad on top of this ad.
[118:45.87]Go watch this ad.
[118:46.85]Let me see.
[118:47.90]Please go watch this ad on top of this ad on top of this ad.
[118:51.28]There's a goblin and you're
[118:53.58]Go watch this ad.
[118:55.06]My hatred's too low for this.
[118:58.30]Yeah, I guess if you're behind on 720, then... Oh my god, what did I die from?
[119:05.65]If you're behind on 720, then... I died.
[119:12.53]Oh.
[119:14.12]Is that my fault?
[119:15.34]No, it's my fault.
[119:16.24]If you're behind on 720, refresh the page.
[119:18.50]Because that'll get you back in check.
[119:21.10]Because some people are, like, five to ten minutes behind.
[119:28.57]Why don't I have adblock on?
[119:30.63]Um... Because, I mean, at least for YouTube, I like to support YouTubers.
[119:36.33]Like, at least people that run ads on their videos.
[119:39.21]So, like, if I have a friend or something that has ads, I usually keep it on.
[119:42.98]Just because I like to be nice to them.
[119:45.80]I don't know.
[119:48.64]Pretty good guy.
[119:49.50]Plus, can't adblock block other stuff it's not supposed to?
[119:52.82]I don't think so.
[119:56.38]What's it not supposed to block?
[119:58.00]I don't know.
[119:59.04]I remember hearing that at some places it might think something is an ad when it's not.
[120:03.50]I don't think I've seen anything like that.
[120:09.41]Do you have adblock?
[120:11.79]I do.
[120:12.21]I turn it off sometimes, though.
[120:13.33]Usually when I watch streams or whatever.
[120:14.95]Yeah.
[120:17.29]I assume that's what a lot of people do.
[120:18.89]I guess it can get really annoying.
[120:20.79]If you're just browsing websites and it's like, oh, take over your entire screen with an ad.
[120:25.25]I hate those.
[120:26.29]I would open four pages to tell you that this is an ad.
[120:29.32]The worst thing in the world is those.
[120:31.08]The other page is going to open and tell you to watch the other page we open.
[120:38.98]For a second, I thought we just beat her, but I was looking at the chat.
[120:42.91]Now she's pumped.
[120:48.88]she's done kill the daughters of pain destroyed wait did she she really did die didn't she no no that's that's like her like introduce myself thing isn't it oh yeah this is the one where she doesn't even fight you she just like shows up and is like hey and then you shoot her once and she says no she just introduces herself hi I'm a spider
[121:13.23]Yeah, somebody said ad blockers can mess up some forums.
[121:15.59]Honestly, for this part, I was playing through when I was dealing with this character, and I was thinking to myself that you probably were supposed to beat her there, and there was probably supposed to be a different boss later, and they just were like, eh, no.
[121:28.99]Eh, maybe not.
[121:29.83]We'll just let her run away.
[121:32.91]Really feels like that.
[121:34.75]Feels like that with a lot of stuff in this game.
[121:37.88]But they're patching it.
[121:39.24]There's apparently a big patch they're working on for this game.
[121:42.58]They haven't said anything about it, but let's wait and see what it is.
[121:46.62]I hope it's $15.
[121:48.26]Please let it be $15.
[121:49.92]$15.
[121:50.52]If it was $15, I would literally dump a brick.
[121:54.28]I would have to run to the bathroom because a brick would be coming out.
[121:58.77]I just imagine you taking a very long drive to a nearby dump, taking a brick out of your car and just flopping it somewhere.
[122:07.03]That is how mad you are.
[122:08.87]Going that far out of your way.
[122:13.03]So close now, children of the corn.
[122:18.05]Ah, you destroyed the heart.
[122:19.11]I'm so mad, but I'll keep haunting you with sexual implications.
[122:26.69]Anyone would want to bang a spider.
[122:32.65]Spider.
[122:33.97]So seductive.
[122:38.75]Good job confusing those two bugs.
[122:49.28]Hey, I did my part.
[122:51.14]It's not like these things are giving up.
[122:52.40]They, like, died before it even came out.
[122:57.50]I did my part.
[123:00.08]See, I should have used it right now, but it's on cooldown because I'm stupid.
[123:05.66]Oh, yeah, this would be a great time to use it, because there's a bunch of blue people.
[123:08.60]Oh, oh, I see a yellow.
[123:10.78]I see a yellow.
[123:11.42]I'm not going to pick it up now, because I want to kill stuff first.
[123:15.62]Then the server shut down.
[123:18.22]Oh, that would be terrible if it did.
[123:19.34]I'm already overburdened.
[123:22.10]Really?
[123:23.44]You were just in town.
[123:25.00]Legs, okay, legs.
[123:28.74]These are very good for someone else that is not me.
[123:35.23]I will hold on to them, though.
[123:41.14]Oh, gotta make a town run.
[123:42.78]It's all about that money.
[123:45.68]All about the paper.
[123:47.66]It's all about that Diablo 3 money.
[123:54.26]Once I get a million gold, I'll be happy.
[123:56.64]I'm slowly getting there.
[123:58.06]I have 571,000 gold.
[123:58.62]I'm getting there.
[124:04.60]take a look at some of this stuff.
[124:08.90]I got a lot of just crappy rares that I just need to sell.
[124:11.30]It's going to take too long in the auction house.
[124:15.41]I'll save these for later.
[124:16.75]Maybe I will try and sell them.
[124:19.59]Yeah, I think my auction house actually cleared, and all of the items that were in the completed section are gone.
[124:26.20]All the items that I was selling are gone.
[124:27.74]That's weird.
[124:29.50]I shouldn't do that.
[124:31.06]Yeah, it probably shouldn't, but...
[124:35.07]hmm I need just I gotta stash a lot of this stuff I I need after we kill asthma dan I need like a million minutes to like sort through all this stuff that I have okay I hope people are ready for like the most exciting part of this stream Jerma going through his items and figuring out what he's gonna sell hey with this item
[125:07.32]my backpack.
[125:12.16]I'm just gonna sell these, I don't need them.
[125:16.90]Whatever, I'll hold onto them for now.
[125:18.70]Just because.
[125:19.34]Potions are expensive in this game.
[125:24.32]Yes.
[125:24.46]I concur.
[125:27.02]Potions are very expensive.
[125:38.31]That's why I got ferrets.
[125:41.77]Ferrets!
[125:49.63]My buddy's here.
[125:50.35]You know, I'm gonna check out that other ruin for fire bats.
[126:01.20]Let me check it out.
[126:05.65]Money, money, money, get it, get it, get the money.
[126:07.07]Alright, let me see the fire bats.
[126:10.01]Rapidly summon bats that seek out nearby enemies for 280% weapon damage as fire.
[126:14.70]Oh my god, I'll try that right now.
[126:17.30]That was a lot of damage.
[126:21.02]I would recommend that to anyone who likes damage.
[126:24.98]I'll stick with Blow Dart just because I love Blow Dart.
[126:26.70]Let me check this out.
[126:27.36]Let's see.
[126:29.10]Oh, it's... Okay.
[126:31.05]Cool.
[126:32.39]It's a lot less group.
[126:33.77]Not really a crowd move anymore.
[126:36.43]It's kind of a single target move now.
[126:39.63]I should go to Whimsy Shire.
[126:42.43]I'm not at that stage.
[126:44.49]I'm a noob.
[126:45.87]I'm not ready for the ponies.
[126:47.45]I'm not ready for it yet.
[126:51.19]What is Hodor?
[126:51.79]Hodor?
[126:52.15]What's that?
[126:52.57]Hodor.
[126:53.15]Hodor.
[126:57.36]I guess I can just kind of stand back and do this.
[126:59.30]It does a lot of damage.
[127:01.44]It blows through mana like crazy though.
[127:03.22]I don't know if I like it.
[127:06.98]I'll try it for a little while.
[127:12.71]I'm not picking up Pages of Jewelcrafting only because it's not something I plan on doing, at least right now.
[127:17.55]Once I have a ton of money... Well, even then, you would use tomes.
[127:20.57]Yeah, I mean, I'm in Nightmare right now, so the Pages of Jewelcrafting aren't going to get me really anything.
[127:27.12]Why is my dude dead?
[127:31.24]Oh boy.
[127:34.17]Run away!
[127:35.87]Go get him, bat!
[127:40.51]The reason why I didn't stream yesterday is because I was having internet problems.
[127:44.94]I couldn't get 720 to go through.
[127:49.00]And even 360 was being really, really slow and choppy.
[127:51.64]Something was going on with the internet.
[127:53.82]I don't know why, but I'm doing an extra long one tonight.
[127:57.16]Today.
[127:57.88]This morning.
[128:00.44]Extra, extra.
[128:02.50]Extra, re-extra.
[128:03.86]Read all about it.
[128:07.06]You can help me when you feel like it.
[128:11.18]I felt like it.
[128:13.56]Dan, if you're just joining us, you just kind of jumped in.
[128:16.85]Star is here.
[128:17.43]Hi.
[128:19.63]The star.
[128:21.87]47, there we go.
[128:23.93]Level it up.
[128:28.47]Ooh, new runes.
[128:30.16]What are they?
[128:33.00]Spirit Walker rune, I'm gonna check that out.
[128:35.72]Yep, this will be on the channel later.
[128:37.62]For sure.
[128:38.52]For sure.
[128:40.60]For sure.
[128:45.32]What time is it?
[128:46.73]It's almost 20 of 11 AM.
[128:51.27]Oh yeah, it tells you the time in Diablo.
[128:53.73]Remember we were talking about that?
[128:55.05]It's like, oh, how much time have we lost?
[128:56.95]Oh, there it is.
[128:57.85]And my DX story has covered it, but actually it's on the left now.
[129:00.70]Haha.
[129:04.65]The Sin Heart.
[129:09.11]Get that waypoint.
[129:13.98]Bats, bats everywhere!
[129:19.44]Gimme that money, gimme that money.
[129:23.48]Yo, money!
[129:24.51]CONFUSION!
[129:26.49]See, I used it at a good time that time, didn't I?
[129:28.55]Are you proud of me?
[129:29.03]Yeah.
[129:29.71]I am.
[129:30.29]There was... There was a lot of reasons to do that.
[129:36.18]I might have to take off that passive skill, which makes all my mana stuff cost more money.
[129:40.56]I mean, more mana.
[129:41.54]Oh, it makes all my mana cost more money.
[129:45.28]It makes your mana cost more mana?
[129:47.52]For what?
[129:51.84]All of your damage is increased by 20%, but every spell costs 30% more mana.
[129:57.66]But that's so good.
[129:58.76]It's so much more damage than I wouldn't be doing.
[130:04.86]Squeaky chair.
[130:06.20]I'll probably be playing Diablo 3
[130:18.05]You mean today?
[130:21.64]Probably after we kill Asmodan, once we get to the last part of this act.
[130:26.86]I might take a break.
[130:28.14]But if you meant long term, I'll be playing this game for probably a very long time.
[130:33.84]I would say, if it turns out, after all the patches and all the bug fixes and after the initial launch period, then if it all stays well and it's all good, I'll be playing this game for a very, very, very long time.
[130:47.08]Yeah, okay.
[130:48.24]You ever hear of this game, MXO, that we still need to play?
[130:52.38]Uh, MxE?
[130:53.24]Most Extreme Elimination Challenge?
[130:54.83]Yes.
[130:55.31]Did you actually install D2?
[130:56.51]Uh, I actually did not.
[131:00.01]But that'll take two seconds.
[131:02.01]It's only like a one gig file, to be honest.
[131:04.41]Oh, did you download it?
[131:06.27]I think I have it downloaded, so it shouldn't take that long to do.
[131:09.73]When you download it and install it, don't open it.
[131:13.39]Don't do that.
[131:13.79]Oh, okay.
[131:16.04]I think I still have.
[131:17.96]I think I downloaded it on this computer a long time ago.
[131:20.90]I think it's still sitting.
[131:22.30]The installation file is still sitting on the computer somewhere.
[131:28.02]I'd like to ask you a very serious question right now.
[131:31.22]What is with the dudes in the background?
[131:32.99]What is your theory on why you can never see their feet?
[131:37.99]They're having a party.
[131:41.43]And they're the piñatas.
[131:45.50]These poor guys!
[131:47.38]I mean, Asmodean would certainly have a much higher chance of winning this whole war if he just, like, unchained those guys.
[131:53.11]Yeah, if he just unchained... Yeah, watch out for the disco ball.
[131:55.15]Just, like, one of them.
[131:56.69]You unchain one of those guys, he will take out an entire city.
[131:59.19]Yeah, I don't know.
[132:00.53]Maybe they... They're not that good at fighting?
[132:06.85]What are they good at?
[132:07.79]What are they doing?
[132:08.51]Why are they here?
[132:09.37]Well, I mean, think of it this way.
[132:12.29]These guys are probably not that strong at this point.
[132:14.27]They've been kind of chained up with stuff in their heads.
[132:17.74]Why?
[132:18.48]I don't think they'd be that tough anymore.
[132:20.04]If you released them, they'd probably just fall over and go... Even if they just fell over, that'd be a pretty big fall.
[132:28.65]Make them fall in the right spot.
[132:31.95]They'd roll around and be like, change my diaper.
[132:36.97]I don't want that in Haragith or wherever.
[132:39.61]You're so close now.
[132:41.21]So close.
[132:43.81]Oh, yeah.
[132:45.61]You destroyed the Sinheart.
[132:47.34]I can't believe you.
[132:49.28]How dare you.
[132:51.58]Second important question.
[132:52.70]Why is there no elevator here?
[132:56.40]Yeah, and you know what?
[132:57.38]Follow-up important question.
[132:58.58]How did Asmodan get down here?
[133:02.28]Like, he didn't come down these stairs.
[133:05.52]He's too big.
[133:07.00]Was he just, like, born in the bottom and he just never goes anywhere?
[133:10.22]He doesn't ever go out?
[133:12.43]I guess.
[133:13.15]Like, oh, let me, like... Here's my house, my big Asmodan house.
[133:16.25]I'm, like, a 75-foot-tall, like, 9-million-pound monster.
[133:20.65]Let me walk down my spiral staircase.
[133:22.93]When you can, like, astral project images of your head so you can talk shit to people.
[133:29.12]Like, when that's your thing, I don't imagine you going out.
[133:31.57]Yeah, I'd probably just sit there and, like, call ex-girlfriends.
[133:36.50]You have no hope.
[133:38.28]Foot to foot dive.
[133:45.04]Eat it, bats.
[133:45.80]Eat bats.
[133:51.75]More bats.
[133:52.49]Stand in the middle.
[133:54.25]Oh god, oh god, oh god.
[133:56.76]Yeah, I need a more crowd move.
[133:58.66]This is a very single target.
[134:01.46]I'm not sure I'm going to stick with it.
[134:03.16]Or I'm going to have to change poison dart to something else.
[134:09.21]Maybe he uses teleportation.
[134:10.41]That is a good theory.
[134:11.37]That is a good theory.
[134:13.05]Maybe.
[134:13.33]I mean...
[134:15.26]He is the lord of beer.
[134:18.67]Did you say beer?
[134:21.03]I said beer.
[134:23.73]Asmodan, lord of beer.
[134:25.17]Oh yeah, Asmodan.
[134:26.15]He owns a microbrewery.
[134:28.37]The lord of beer.
[134:31.06]How dare you.
[134:31.98]Oh god, I'm dead.
[134:33.20]I'm going to die right now.
[134:35.25]How dare you insult the Lord of Beer?
[134:40.43]Wellow in the fear of my delicious hops and yeast.
[134:47.55]I thought he was fearing.
[134:48.62]That's why he was always trying to scare people.
[134:52.44]I'm getting off on that.
[134:56.24]He's a weird one.
[134:58.12]He does live with a spider lady that's hell-bent on making us love her but hate her at the same time.
[135:04.92]Why won't you bang me?
[135:06.82]This is his roommate, by the way.
[135:08.24]You know, that's what you gotta live with.
[135:10.30]I would go crazy.
[135:10.70]That's like his wife or something.
[135:14.52]Maybe he just got drunk one night and woke up down there, is what someone said.
[135:18.31]She just won't leave.
[135:19.55]Like, oh man, where am I?
[135:21.23]I'm so shit-faced right now.
[135:24.27]Where is this place?
[135:25.31]Oh, I own it now.
[135:27.19]Oh, this is mine.
[135:33.49]Oh, this is mine.
[135:42.39]Yeah, I bet he doesn't even know why these giant tall guys are here.
[135:45.10]Alright, this definitely gets comment of the stream.
[135:49.02]Damn it.
[135:49.80]I want to take a dump.
[135:51.02]Will you guys talk louder so I can hear you from the crap?
[135:56.22]Oh my god.
[135:59.58]Oh my goodness.
[136:00.64]Get her.
[136:03.23]Yeah, I can't even stun.
[136:05.53]That move only works on actual enemies.
[136:07.83]It's unfortunate.
[136:11.64]Alright, kill it before the teleport.
[136:12.94]Kill it before the teleport.
[136:15.04]Oh, she's slowing me down.
[136:18.04]Die, die, die, die, die.
[136:19.16]Unless you're, like, a normal and one-shotter.
[136:22.73]Maybe we're getting it?
[136:24.29]Oh, wow.
[136:28.47]Now blow up one of Asmodan's, like, four hearts.
[136:31.35]Is he a cow or something?
[136:33.46]Ah!
[136:34.38]He must be a cow.
[136:35.36]No, cows... Oh my god, I'm an idiot.
[136:39.30]Cows have multiple stomachs, not multiple hearts.
[136:43.79]Oh, is he like a cow?
[136:44.71]He has like four hearts.
[136:47.47]Derp.
[136:48.13]Oh, look.
[136:49.15]Oh, come on.
[136:49.73]It's starting to make sense.
[136:50.95]What is it?
[136:51.71]This is one of those big guys' chests.
[136:54.15]It's ripped open, and the heart is placed over here.
[136:57.69]What?
[136:59.09]You see?
[136:59.45]That's...
[137:01.35]Why would they do such a thing?
[137:02.67]And then the heart powers Duracell.
[137:11.32]I don't get how the heart's power is working.
[137:13.00]Well, how come, then, look at this guy.
[137:14.18]How come this guy isn't, like, has a Sin heart?
[137:16.50]Maybe he's not cool enough?
[137:17.90]I guess they're, like, harvesting them, like, if one of the hearts pops.
[137:21.41]Seriously, look at this.
[137:22.85]There is no way Asmodan can fit down this staircase.
[137:25.87]Look at this.
[137:26.25]There's no way!
[137:28.19]Look at the height.
[137:29.79]I'm pointing at the screen right now, by the way.
[137:31.31]I don't know why.
[137:32.47]The height of this ceiling.
[137:34.77]Look at this.
[137:35.75]I'm going to go in my door.
[137:37.15]He wouldn't even be able to get in here.
[137:38.03]Maybe he just jumps down.
[137:39.63]He doesn't use the stairs.
[137:40.57]He just rolls off the edge.
[137:46.87]Somebody asked, how is this early morning?
[137:49.74]It's not anymore.
[137:52.48]I've been going for a couple hours, at least a few hours.
[137:55.74]It was early morning.
[137:58.31]When I started.
[138:01.01]I am healed.
[138:02.63]So after this, I'm probably gonna... close the stream out for a little while.
[138:06.87]I might come back, I'm not sure though.
[138:09.11]Probably not, because I wanna get some food and... I might go to the gym.
[138:13.21]But, uh, get the waypoint.
[138:14.97]We're about to kill Asmodan.
[138:16.95]This is on Nightmare, so he might be a little tough.
[138:20.13]Yeah, okay.
[138:20.65]He might be super tough.
[138:22.47]Don't build it up.
[138:25.65]Everyone's gonna be very disappointed when he dies.
[138:31.74]Bats, bats, bats, bats, bats.
[138:39.03]I started... Oh, let me use Mass Confusion.
[138:41.63]Ready?
[138:41.81]I'll do it.
[138:42.13]I'll use it.
[138:43.41]I started at... 7.30?
[138:47.13]8 a.m.
[138:48.07]my time?
[138:48.51]So it's been about three hours.
[138:51.15]Going on like three and a half, maybe?
[138:53.93]I never know until I'm done and I look at the file that goes up to YouTube.
[139:01.56]But it'll probably be about three and a half, four hours, the whole thing.
[139:04.38]I would assume.
[139:06.66]Oh, God.
[139:10.31]Oh, you live in Hong Kong.
[139:11.81]So it is, like, nighttime or something for you.
[139:14.97]Oh, wait, no, you're behind.
[139:16.05]I don't even know.
[139:16.99]Time zones, how you work.
[139:18.55]Okay.
[139:25.60]If you didn't get to see the TF2 or you didn't get to see the beginning of the Diablo 3 stuff, it's all going to be up in probably a couple hours.
[139:31.94]The whole thing will be on YouTube.
[139:36.42]Mass Confusion!
[139:38.33]Did it even... Oh, there we go.
[139:39.29]Alright, I got that dude charmed.
[139:45.77]Kill him.
[139:46.39]You're on my team now.
[139:48.83]Oh, okay.
[139:49.51]No, I wasn't talking to you.
[139:50.30]Hey, kill him!
[139:51.34]No, I'm not that much of a jerk.
[139:56.13]I just got a rare.
[139:57.65]Come on.
[139:58.11]Give me a good roll.
[139:58.69]Give me a good roll.
[140:00.42]Ooh.
[140:04.62]Nope.
[140:05.20]Oh, actually, with a gem in there.
[140:06.82]No, I don't think so.
[140:08.10]No.
[140:09.42]Do I look good in this?
[140:11.30]Does this make me look fat?
[140:16.81]Where's my buddy?
[140:17.33]There he is.
[140:19.77]He always dies, and I never, like, realize it.
[140:21.65]Yeah.
[140:26.43]If you just made, like, a compilation of the noises I've made in this stream, and just made a video of it, like, it would be, like, you'd probably be pretty funny.
[140:34.62]Like, I make a whole lot of noises.
[140:39.88]Someone said, go star, I love you.
[140:43.32]I'm going.
[140:45.96]Here we are.
[140:46.42]Alright, so this is it.
[140:47.32]So after this, I'm gonna close out the stream.
[140:51.91]And we will go from there, and this will all be uploaded to YouTube.
[140:54.21]YouTube.
[140:56.59]If we don't wipe, like, five times, which we will not, because Star is a pro.
[141:03.08]Well, there he is.
[141:03.80]There's a guy that lives down here, and he can't move.
[141:06.58]Who wiggles around and jiggles his... There he comes.
[141:13.54]Go get him, gargantuan!
[141:18.62]You know what?
[141:19.02]I want to do this and that.
[141:21.78]Bats!
[141:25.21]He's going down.
[141:26.99]Very, very easily.
[141:28.87]What is that bomb move you're doing?
[141:30.07]Oh my god, I almost got one shot.
[141:31.35]What bomb move?
[141:32.93]That looks like the assassin skill.
[141:34.58]Remember the first assassin skill you really got is... Oh, yeah.
[141:38.22]Firebombs.
[141:39.10]Yeah.
[141:39.54]It's kind of like that.
[141:41.04]I can't even like... I really only use it to build hatred.
[141:43.42]I'm gonna die.
[141:44.00]I'm dead.
[141:44.62]Oh, you're dead.
[141:45.68]I'm dead.
[141:47.76]Stay alive, star.
[141:49.44]Um, I'm okay.
[141:51.10]I got ferrets.
[141:52.78]Use those ferrets to kill this fat, sloppy bastard.
[141:56.74]They're trying to keep up with me, and they're, like, spazzing out so hard.
[142:00.87]There is no way you're going to be able to come get me, by the way.
[142:02.97]I'm, like, in this pool of, like, this darkness pool.
[142:05.65]You're going to die if you even try to revive me.
[142:08.63]I got you.
[142:09.13]Trust me.
[142:09.45]I can do it.
[142:10.35]I got to do it just because you said I couldn't.
[142:15.32]Oh, you did it.
[142:16.50]I love you.
[142:21.77]He spawns adds?
[142:23.37]Adds?
[142:24.71]What?
[142:26.11]It's a MMO term.
[142:30.99]Give me a legendary, give me a legendary!
[142:32.38]No, just a bunch of blues.
[142:35.30]Give me a blue.
[142:37.10]Got a blue.
[142:38.42]Sweet.
[142:40.18]Oh no, we gotta see the cutscene.
[142:43.48]Skip!
[142:45.06]No, I wanted to know what happened.
[142:47.76]Alright, here's what happened.
[142:49.06]So we just killed a big fat guy and he died.
[142:51.26]And then she slams a rock into his soul.
[142:56.37]And then they all rock out.
[143:01.39]Oh, I've never been to Hong Kong.
[143:04.07]It's very far away.
[143:04.85]I've never been, besides Canada, I've never been out of the country.
[143:11.64]I was in Pennsylvania once.
[143:14.70]One time.
[143:17.28]furthest I've been is probably Wisconsin or Minnesota whichever is further furthest I've been is uh Seattle Seattle Washington you said you were in Canada well I I've been to Canada I don't live there whatever whatever well I meant like out of the country that's like the only that's like the furthest place out of the country I've never gone anywhere else
[143:48.55]Mmm, that's a lot of damage.
[143:50.45]It's two-handed, though.
[143:52.44]I don't want to do this event.
[143:53.28]I don't want people to... Spoiler!
[143:55.30]Alright, spoiler alert.
[143:56.14]Spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, spoiler.
[143:59.30]Except, here we go.
[144:00.28]Spoiler!
[144:00.80]I don't know how many times I have to say that.
[144:02.52]Spoiler!
[144:03.08]Okay.
[144:08.25]Hooray!
[144:10.55]That's gonna be the end here, guys.
[144:13.87]Oh my god.
[144:15.17]Goodbye.
[144:17.13]Everyone.
[144:18.71]Every time I try to end a YouTube stream, I always forget how to do it.
[144:21.75]So let me figure this out.
[144:24.15]Thank you all so much for watching and sticking around.
[144:27.49]Goodbye to Star.
[144:28.81]Say your byes.
[144:30.83]Thank you, Star, for coming along and playing.
[144:33.35]I hope you all hate Jerma.
[144:36.69]I mean, pancakes with chips.
[144:40.29]Hey, chocolate chip pancakes are good.
[144:42.09]They're good.
[144:43.09]I'm hoping every comment is about that.
[144:46.13]Just telling you you're wrong.
[144:48.35]You're wrong.
[144:50.37]That would make my day.
[144:53.67]Event manager?
[144:55.49]Life controller, there it is.
[144:57.63]Alright dudes, take it easy everybody.
[145:00.37]And take care everybody.
[145:02.35]Peace soup.
[145:08.94]Figured it out yet?
[145:10.12]Not yet, I'm still figuring it out.
[145:13.65]This is getting awkward.
[145:18.72]I'm trying to edit.
