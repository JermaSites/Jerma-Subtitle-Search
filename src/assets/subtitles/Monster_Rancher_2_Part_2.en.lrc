[ve:60.16.100]

[00:57.44]Hey.
[01:00.02]Somebody answer me this.
[01:01.52]I'm trying to figure this out in real time here.
[01:03.40]I'm on my iPhone.
[01:06.84]Why is it that every time that iPhones have any kind of software update, they could change a couple of localized text files?
[01:16.89]Why is it that I have to, like, reset up my iPhone as if it's factory new every time they decide to change a piece of fucking code?
[01:27.28]Why?
[01:29.02]I have to, like, reactivate my whole iPhone because I updated... Fucking Apple, man.
[01:35.12]You know what apples are good for?
[01:38.42]Eating them.
[01:40.62]Fruits.
[01:51.23]So I'm sitting here, I'm pulling my phone up to tweet that I'm live, and I get, you know, it gives you like every fucking language, like, hello, let's go through them, ready?
[02:02.28]Oh, hello, hola, guten tag.
[02:06.68]Asian lettering, I don't know how to say that.
[02:08.86]You know, like, just fucking let me use my iPhone.
[02:12.90]What'd you do, you changed a couple security patches?
[02:22.08]I don't know how to say it.
[02:30.22]Just switch to a PDA.
[02:37.51]No, I think technology is dumb.
[02:40.81]Just wait.
[02:46.52]Alright, here we go.
[02:47.40]Give me a minute.
[02:47.88]I'll be right back.
[03:19.07]The time to activate my iPhone has expired.
[03:21.05]Yeah, I ran into it like a timeout.
[03:37.90]Because I was sitting here talking about it.
[03:39.02]Just give me a minute.
[03:41.44]Just give me...
[04:03.55]Okay.
[04:05.37]So, we're going to continue our journey in Monster Rancher 2.
[04:11.73]And we're going to play this one for a little while.
[04:16.95]Until I'm not really feeling it anymore.
[04:18.94]And usually you can tell when I'm not feeling it because four streams will go by.
[04:24.50]Have I ever streamed a video game in a row?
[04:27.90]More than three or four streams in a row?
[04:31.06]I'm not sure I've ever done that.
[04:34.91]Can anybody think of in the history of me turning on a live stream?
[04:41.64]Red Dead?
[04:42.00]Did I do Red Dead in a row?
[04:45.88]Sorcery?
[04:46.70]Maybe, yeah.
[04:49.14]Stardew, maybe?
[04:49.82]Yeah, I think I did play Stardew for like two weeks straight.
[04:56.02]But, yeah, I'm having a great time.
[04:57.96]I think it's a very... It's a very endearing video game.
[05:03.40]It's not the best mechanics-wise, it's not the greatest game ever, but something about Monster Rancher is awesome.
[05:11.31]So I'm going to continue to play it.
[05:12.95]One of my games of the year for 2018 is Monster Rancher 2.
[05:19.46]Alright, let's play the game, hold on.
[05:23.30]My carumba.
[05:25.34]Is that what Bart Simpson says?
[05:27.98]Like, eat my carumba, right?
[05:31.14]Eat my, that means shorts, right?
[05:34.16]When Bart Simpson says, eat my shorts, and when he says, ay caramba.
[05:39.29]Caramba is shorts.
[05:40.79]So he's going, ay shorts!
[06:28.14]Sorry, sometimes when you make a reference or a joke that, you know, you're deliberately making terrible... Sometimes you just have to let chat take it in for a minute, you know what I mean?
[06:38.43]In silence.
[06:41.25]Alright, so, um, here we go.
[06:44.83]Here he is.
[06:45.21]He's just hanging out, having a good time.
[06:48.31]Let's see, we got $52.70.
[06:51.87]There's our good friend.
[06:57.27]Beanbag Sonic.
[07:02.09]Make a new monster?
[07:02.95]Uh, we, you know what?
[07:04.15]Let's... Let's ease into it a little bit here.
[07:06.83]We don't have to do anything too crazy right off the bat.
[07:10.55]Just wait, people are still trickling in.
[07:11.79]We can just... Just chill for a minute and have a little discussion.
[07:17.69]Why is he not called the Globgo Gabgalab?
[07:21.21]Because I've watched that video enough times to be able to know that that's his name.
[07:26.55]That's actually surprising that I got it first try.
[07:30.23]So, let's, uh... What do we have coming up?
[07:34.30]What's coming up here?
[07:34.98]We've got a tournament.
[07:35.68]Sea tournament.
[07:38.94]Which is after today.
[07:40.50]Did he rest yet?
[07:41.28]I don't even know.
[07:46.53]This is just an element.
[07:47.33]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[07:47.89]Wasn't there a thing?
[07:48.75]This is the tournament that we have to try to win.
[07:51.35]Because that's how you get to be...
[07:54.05]Yeah, the old guy came down and said, hey, remember the last game?
[07:58.25]People played that one.
[07:59.35]And then you go, oh yeah, that's right.
[08:00.35]And you have to try to go against those people.
[08:04.63]I think he's alright.
[08:06.90]He's still a monster.
[08:08.40]I mean, that's gonna... A sea cup.
[08:12.12]That's gonna be hard to do.
[08:13.26]I'm not sure we're gonna be able to completely and totally take on a sea cup.
[08:23.19]Maybe we will, though.
[08:26.25]He's fine.
[08:27.27]Likes to play.
[08:31.49]He needs a new move, man.
[08:33.19]I don't know.
[08:33.51]Is it worth skipping out?
[08:40.26]Is it worth just not doing this thing?
[08:42.18]Because he only has two moves still.
[08:43.80]He needs to train.
[08:47.73]Let's go with... We're going to do defense, right?
[08:50.97]Skill.
[08:52.07]Yeah, I want skill again.
[08:55.06]Skill and speed, I would say, for now.
[09:04.78]All three.
[09:05.60]Got it.
[09:06.48]Off to a great start.
[09:09.70]No, he needs more than Chop.
[09:15.80]Chop is fine, but he needs more than that.
[09:18.11]You can't live off of Chop, guys.
[09:25.37]Oh, I didn't mean to do the crap.
[09:37.23]He's tired though.
[09:38.07]I'm gonna have to buy him like a candy or something.
[09:43.03]So what do you think?
[09:43.91]Should we do this?
[09:44.35]Should we just try it and see what happens?
[09:46.75]We're gonna go.
[09:47.09]We're gonna make some more monsters in town here.
[09:48.91]I have a couple of good CDs.
[09:50.32]I went searching and I got some more.
[09:53.89]Plus, we might actually be able to use the rare CDs now.
[09:57.77]Do you think I should feed him a... No?
[10:01.83]Go for it?
[10:02.99]No.
[10:04.55]Yes, no.
[10:07.43]Yes, no, yes, no.
[10:08.47]What the hell is this?
[10:15.53]I'm not gonna fuse him, don't worry.
[10:17.67]I will never fuse Beanbag Sonic.
[10:19.32]He's too dear to my heart.
[10:25.32]He's saying yes to monsters.
[10:27.00]Alright, you know, because this is the second stream in a row, let's do a poll here.
[10:32.11]Let's do a poll.
[10:32.91]Let's do this democratically, right?
[10:35.91]Before we get really actually started.
[10:38.57]The poll is going to be for, would you rather see, to start, some new monster creations, or take Beanbag to the top.
[10:49.26]You know?
[10:49.68]Like, just go right for it.
[10:50.56]Like, just take him to the top.
[10:52.68]So here you go.
[10:54.83]Which one?
[10:59.67]Which one?
[11:00.85]Let's go with... Take him to the top?
[11:07.37]You know what that means?
[11:08.65]Or... More monster breeding.
[11:14.58]And remember, this is just for right now.
[11:16.88]We're not talking about later.
[11:19.88]Just right this second.
[11:20.68]Because we're going to do all these damn things.
[11:24.37]So, more monsters.
[11:25.43]Here's the poll.
[11:26.11]Hopefully you can see it.
[11:31.91]Like, are we just going hard on this guy right now?
[11:33.89]Or are we gonna breed some more people?
[11:36.56]To try to get to, like, at least B or A. Nice keyboard sounds.
[11:42.66]What do I got?
[11:43.66]This is A. Um... I don't know.
[11:48.56]There's a G on it.
[11:49.32]It's a Logitech.
[11:50.14]It's a Logitech keyboard.
[11:51.80]Mechanical.
[11:53.60]Let's see if I can read it.
[11:54.48]This is a Logitech G... This is a Logitech G413 Carbon.
[12:04.37]And the only reason why I own this is because I dumped a hard cider on my old Corsair mechanical keyboard and broke it.
[12:14.66]The G is for gaming, that's right.
[12:15.88]Alright, so it looks like we're just gonna go hard here.
[12:19.16]Those of you that want to see more monster breeding, don't worry.
[12:21.42]We will absolutely do that within the next 30 or 40 minutes.
[12:25.80]Let's just try to... Because last time we got to C and we stopped.
[12:30.00]So now we're at stream number 2 at C. Time to move forward.
[12:32.98]What do you say?
[12:35.76]Thank you for participating in the book.
[12:41.91]Go back to Corsair.
[12:46.69]I... This thing works perfectly fine.
[12:48.43]Until this one breaks.
[12:49.69]Just wait.
[12:50.01]I'll break this one soon.
[12:50.95]Don't worry.
[12:51.79]And I'll get a new one.
[12:52.39]Alright, so... Let's go to item.
[12:57.71]Do I have anything already?
[12:58.86]Mango.
[13:00.34]Snack on.
[13:01.08]What is this?
[13:01.58]This is... Nigil.
[13:03.44]This will temporarily stimulate a monster's abilities.
[13:09.18]Huh.
[13:12.74]Didn't somebody say this thing makes your creature live, like, less... ...longer life?
[13:19.67]Can I piece together a coherent sentence?
[13:24.69]Doping before... You want to dope before the tournament and fucking win?
[13:30.40]Uh, we don't have it.
[13:32.14]So let's go get the one that reduces fatigue, and let's try the... Let's just do it.
[13:36.08]We might lose, but, you know, it's okay.
[13:39.04]Can't win every single time.
[13:43.46]Alright, let's get the fatigue.
[13:48.81]Which one is it?
[13:50.07]Is it apple cake?
[13:51.03]No.
[13:51.63]Mint leaf powder.
[13:54.67]Spoils.
[13:55.33]Sour jelly.
[13:56.57]Nut oil.
[13:57.76]Oh, boy.
[14:00.22]Covered from fatigue.
[14:01.00]Alright.
[14:01.40]Only 200.
[14:01.72]We're gonna give Sonic the Hedgehog some nut oil.
[14:08.02]By the way, do not type that into Google.
[14:11.03]I'm gonna save you some pain and suffering here.
[14:14.35]Do not, under any circumstances, ever repeat what I just said.
[14:20.72]Okay.
[14:26.25]this again.
[14:28.07]No, I don't know.
[14:29.27]Why do I do this?
[14:30.15]This is why I can't be live.
[14:31.37]You understand?
[14:32.49]I would have edited that out in post.
[14:34.65]Right?
[14:34.85]If I was making like a YouTube video on Monster Rancher 2, oh, that would have been gone.
[14:38.15]I would have seen what I just said and gone, yeah, see you later.
[14:41.06]And it would have been like, cut, goodbye.
[14:42.52]This is why I can't be live.
[14:44.50]I can't go on a podcast.
[14:51.40]Time for more financial advice.
[14:56.64]Uh... And see, I would have... You know what, here's the... Before we do anything.
[15:00.32]Like, back in the day, if I was playing with somebody, if I was doing, like, a live commentary, like, a live gameplay session with somebody, and I said that, I probably would have, after it was done, been like, Hey, dude, uh, you gonna use that part where they talk about, like, Sonic and, like, nut oil and stuff?
[15:16.17]I would, like, just don't use that.
[15:17.31]Like, it wasn't that funny.
[15:18.37]Like, that part, like, sucked, you know?
[15:19.57]That part wasn't, like, funny.
[15:20.97]And they'd be like, No, I thought it was, like, kind of funny.
[15:22.63]I'd be like, No, it wasn't, though.
[15:23.65]Like, it was just, like, don't use it, though.
[15:25.57]Just, like, take it and cut it, like, you know, take the razor tool in Premiere and go here, and then the other side, and just take it out, because it's not that funny.
[15:34.29]I would do that.
[15:41.53]It's true, I'm telling you, this is a real insight.
[15:48.15]Deep.
[15:49.06]Yeah, real deep.
[15:50.14]Alright, let's go, feed him the fucking... I gotta call it something else.
[15:56.08]Feed Sonic.
[15:58.02]We're gonna call this Almond Oil.
[16:01.08]Almond Oil.
[16:02.82]Yes.
[16:11.80]See?
[16:12.10]51 Loyalty, that's good.
[16:15.08]Okay.
[16:15.89]Time for the battle.
[16:16.59]Let's try it.
[16:17.35]We might just lose, but who cares.
[16:22.94]Because this is higher ranked monsters.
[16:25.03]We might... I would be okay with getting like second or third place.
[16:36.28]Elimination grade C. Almond milk is good.
[16:40.85]I put it in my coffee every day.
[16:43.70]Doesn't give you like the cramps and the stomach aches that regular milk does, you know what I'm saying?
[16:47.32]Almond milk.
[16:47.76]And I'm not one of those people that's going to tell you, go to the supermarket and buy it and drink it out of the can.
[16:52.93]No, just use it.
[16:53.93]Use it in some places, in recipes, substitute, you know?
[16:57.87]Put it in your coffee.
[16:59.77]Put it on your cereal.
[17:03.26]I don't drink soy milk.
[17:06.84]I don't drink like rice milk.
[17:08.54]I don't drink anything else.
[17:09.90]I only drink almond milk.
[17:13.18]It's 2% milk and almond milk.
[17:15.42]Can't go wrong.
[17:21.17]Why is everybody calling me a soy milk?
[17:22.59]What are you talking about?
[17:23.29]I just said I don't like soy milk.
[17:30.69]Alright, Beanbag Sonic versus Gunburn.
[17:33.23]That guy's got a fucking cool name.
[17:34.97]That means we're fucked.
[17:37.50]Alright, what does he got?
[17:39.76]Gunburn has high intelligence.
[17:42.78]Beware of the distance, so I just gotta close the gap and just karate slop.
[17:47.50]Sounds good to me.
[17:48.08]Alright, let's go.
[17:50.08]Beanbag!
[17:51.71]Let's go for that fucking karate slop!
[18:00.57]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[18:02.91]Okay.
[18:03.75]Uh, we're not gonna win this.
[18:06.52]No, no way.
[18:07.70]Not a chance in hell.
[18:09.54]The only way we win this is... No, there's no way.
[18:14.26]Absolutely impossible for us to win.
[18:16.16]Impossible.
[18:29.50]Come on, give him the slop chop.
[18:37.61]That was 1, 2, 3 damage.
[18:39.27]Alright, let's see if we can get lucky here.
[18:41.03]Can I just get lucky and just fucking hit him over and over again?
[18:43.29]Maybe he'll get confused over and over again.
[18:46.39]Come on.
[18:48.21]No, I'm dead.
[18:49.31]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[18:50.27]He might die, so let's not do this.
[18:52.45]I was not ready for this.
[18:53.37]Should've skipped it.
[18:54.69]Just wasted $200 on a fucking almond oil.
[18:59.37]We weren't ready for this.
[19:00.15]He needed more training.
[19:02.47]I hope he's not dead.
[19:11.94]That guy had like 300 stats, that's not fair.
[19:14.30]Alright, we got Susvayne versus Zamber.
[19:22.22]He got eaten alive.
[19:23.08]But, I mean, if we can win one time... I'm gonna try it, because... Wait, wait, who's this?
[19:33.49]Zamber, he lost.
[19:36.02]So with the two that lost, if I can beat this guy, then I could potentially get third place, right?
[19:42.75]And I'll make at least a little bit of money.
[19:45.39]See, you got the two low-tiered shitties fighting each other right now.
[19:48.85]I think we can do it.
[19:55.86]They all have Xbox Live gamer tags now.
[20:01.96]No, this is still bad.
[20:06.88]We have to just get, we have to get, look at his defense.
[20:09.24]Oh boy.
[20:09.86]Can I just turn around and run?
[20:13.04]See you later.
[20:13.94]Well, you know what?
[20:14.50]You can't be that confident.
[20:15.44]You have to lose sometimes, right?
[20:19.25]You can't win every single time.
[20:21.63]Otherwise you'll get so cocky.
[20:24.39]And you'll think that victory is always, always inevitable.
[20:27.83]So losing is okay.
[20:29.48]Mistakes are okay.
[20:30.82]As long as you learn from them.
[20:34.22]Right?
[20:36.11]Is that good?
[20:36.63]Is that a good speech?
[20:38.87]We might still win.
[20:42.89]Keep it up, come on.
[20:43.43]Come on, get a hit here.
[20:47.53]Come on, I don't want to be a loser.
[20:49.43]Come on, losing sucks.
[20:51.95]Got it.
[20:52.54]I don't want to lose.
[20:53.08]Nobody wants to be the loser, you know what I'm saying?
[20:56.98]Come on, get him.
[21:01.88]That was all bullshit, what I just said.
[21:03.20]You want to win.
[21:23.43]You gotta lose to grow as a person, as a monster, as a trainer.
[21:27.68]You have to lose sometimes.
[21:30.02]And that's alright.
[21:34.12]Some of the greatest people of our age had to lose, you know?
[21:41.29]Think about... Like Leonardo DaVinci, for instance.
[21:46.96]He went to that painting competition when he was 16, right?
[21:51.48]And the guy turned around and said, you'll never be a painter!
[21:53.78]And he's like, duh!
[21:55.58]He came back and created the theory of evolution and shit, you know?
[22:00.44]So... You always... Losing is okay.
[22:08.15]Yeah, Leonardo da Vinci lost all of his fights.
[22:09.91]So that doesn't matter.
[22:13.43]We have one more chance.
[22:14.41]I don't know if I wanna do this.
[22:15.29]We might just... I think I'm gonna drop out.
[22:18.17]Do I get anything for not dropping out?
[22:26.82]He just slathered him with some wood, not oil again.
[22:29.16]He'll be fine.
[22:30.94]I think I'm gonna drop out.
[22:34.20]Yeah, he's... we're out.
[22:36.30]We are not ready.
[22:39.57]We have no choice.
[22:41.71]I don't want him to die.
[22:48.28]Well now there's losing and then there's dropping out.
[22:50.94]Oh god.
[22:52.42]No, dropping out is preemptively losing because you know that you're not prepared to win.
[22:58.38]And in some regards, that's even better.
[23:01.48]That's even more intelligent and more prepared.
[23:04.50]Because then you'll come back stronger.
[23:08.65]Probably lost fame for that.
[23:13.29]No money.
[23:15.48]And, ooh, eight of you.
[23:19.67]I lost eight viewers because we dropped out.
[23:31.17]I lost half my audience.
[23:39.30]High IQ loser.
[23:42.03]That's too bad.
[23:42.89]But I think he did a good job.
[23:44.05]See?
[23:45.35]He's fine.
[23:52.11]Which food?
[23:52.65]Let's give him something good.
[23:54.17]Let's give him some jelly.
[23:56.13]Wait, no.
[23:56.55]We're collecting... Aren't we collecting these?
[24:00.91]We are.
[24:05.92]No, he hates those.
[24:06.62]Yeah, let's give him a jelly.
[24:13.15]No, he's not getting any more almond oil.
[24:16.79]Enough of that loser talk, huh?
[24:27.91]We already went over this.
[24:28.77]Ooh, a diamond mark.
[24:31.35]Only a few more of these.
[24:34.79]Let him rest.
[24:36.55]Here we go.
[24:36.93]This is when we can finally train.
[24:38.75]Yes.
[24:43.57]All training is at a 50% discount.
[24:48.07]See?
[24:48.37]Everybody that wanted us to just spend it?
[24:50.69]No.
[24:50.99]It's a good thing we didn't.
[24:54.22]Let's let him rest.
[24:56.60]We spoiled it.
[24:57.40]How?
[25:01.94]Just go to bed.
[25:05.18]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:07.80]Don't you dare.
[25:09.36]Don't you dare right now.
[25:10.98]Okay?
[25:11.55]Okay.
[25:13.13]We just started.
[25:13.88]Don't you fucking dare with this bullshit.
[25:17.54]Thank you.
[25:20.96]Alright.
[25:21.46]For a second I thought the internet was going down.
[25:23.74]Oh, don't you dare.
[25:26.22]I'm enjoying this.
[25:27.35]Don't you fucking dare.
[25:29.07]Whoever's in control of that.
[25:32.67]Yeah, I just dropped like 130 frames in like... Oh boy, that's not good.
[25:39.05]Alright, we're good.
[25:40.90]Just pretend it never happened.
[25:43.19]Everyone just chill.
[25:44.01]Naaah, don't do it!
[25:48.77]It's trying.
[25:49.39]Time for the telephone stream.
[25:52.17]Alright, let's go to Train, go to Errantry.
[25:57.53]Now this is where we need to be very, very sure of what we're doing here.
[26:04.04]Um, let me save it first.
[26:06.88]I'm gonna save it first, because we have to be sure about this.
[26:18.22]Technology, yeah.
[26:19.26]Am I right?
[26:19.94]I know, seriously.
[26:23.27]Internet.
[26:24.13]When are we gonna get the next internet?
[26:27.63]For cords and cables.
[26:31.69]I can't wait for that new internet, you know what I'm saying?
[26:36.51]So, are we doing speed?
[26:44.28]So we can do power life, intelligence life, skill, speed and life.
[26:48.34]What do you think?
[26:50.20]Should we just max out his speed?
[26:52.43]What do you think?
[27:02.87]Yeah?
[27:04.95]Now, we have enough money to do this again.
[27:06.33]I can do this again next month.
[27:09.32]I have 4900 bucks.
[27:13.50]We'll do speed and life.
[27:16.32]Because that's what the people want.
[27:17.64]I'm looking over here and that's what people want.
[27:19.40]We're going to do it.
[27:21.80]It seems that there is some chance to acquire a new technique there.
[27:26.52]Do you want to send... Alright, now hold on a minute.
[27:29.54]Because... Should I just... Should I do D level?
[27:34.98]I mean, it's all 1,000 gold anyway.
[27:37.60]Is this just meaningless?
[27:38.54]Should I just get the easiest thing?
[27:41.58]Should I go up against Garfield?
[27:42.52]What do you think?
[27:47.07]Because I'm unfamiliar with how this works.
[27:51.29]Seems like this doesn't matter at all.
[27:58.10]Monsters are just random.
[28:01.02]E, D, and C, they're all 1,000 gold unless you do A. So why would I... Because it's a random encounter, right?
[28:08.52]D, D, D.
[28:17.34]Oh, this is just Garfield.
[28:18.18]This is another Garfield.
[28:24.29]Does every single tier have a Garfield?
[28:26.09]Let's see.
[28:26.35]Yeah, this is Blue Garfield.
[28:30.73]That's Merlin.
[28:31.67]What's his name?
[28:32.43]What's the other cat's name?
[28:37.98]Is that guy's name Horny?
[28:45.37]He, like, looks horny.
[28:47.11]What the fuck?
[28:50.88]Hey, take that out!
[28:52.90]Take the razor tool in Premiere.
[28:55.56]I don't want to use that.
[28:56.34]Put the blade right there.
[28:59.30]Cut that side.
[28:59.96]Cut that side.
[29:00.62]Remove that.
[29:01.08]I didn't say any of that.
[29:02.45]I don't want that in the video.
[29:08.87]Look at these guys.
[29:09.83]Alright, let's do this one.
[29:10.95]It's the easiest.
[29:13.46]We'll go with default golf field.
[29:20.20]First stage, Frozen Slope.
[29:22.77]This is Sonic music, by the way.
[29:23.99]Listen to the Sonic the Hedgehog music.
[29:27.69]Come on, get up there.
[29:32.37]He did it.
[29:42.00]Icicle falls.
[29:42.58]Stage two.
[29:43.06]Wow!
[29:43.80]Just barely missed it.
[29:45.44]Excellent work.
[29:50.38]More speed.
[29:53.24]This is like the time's about to run out Sonic the Hedgehog music.
[29:57.27]Ice quake.
[30:00.33]Ooh!
[30:00.69]No!
[30:01.59]Wow.
[30:02.57]Oh, I'm so invested.
[30:03.47]Did he make it?
[30:05.37]Oh.
[30:08.35]Sorry, he can do it.
[30:09.29]Try it again.
[30:10.77]You can do it.
[30:13.37]Get up there!
[30:17.04]Come on!
[30:24.74]284 speed, the life is not going up that high.
[30:27.56]It's alright, he didn't make it to the end.
[30:31.48]But he tried.
[30:32.76]Did he learn something new?
[30:34.46]New technique, finally!
[30:37.12]It seems pretty strong.
[30:38.62]Praise it.
[30:39.73]Wait, he's spoiled though.
[30:43.74]Should I not praise him?
[30:45.50]Because he's spoiled.
[30:47.04]Should I be like... The turn away and look at the other side of the camera father?
[30:51.44]That's like... Finally did something right.
[30:55.80]Praise him.
[31:01.61]He failed.
[31:02.15]Don't praise.
[31:02.75]I'm not... I can't just... No.
[31:11.71]He dies in the shed.
[31:14.45]What?
[31:16.06]She's very tired.
[31:18.02]Style, see?
[31:18.58]Style's soft.
[31:21.64]Style's soft.
[31:22.38]We're still soft.
[31:23.66]I just brought him down from being totally complacent.
[31:26.51]No, I'm sorry.
[31:30.79]I'm sorry.
[31:32.21]They're right.
[31:34.67]Let's see what the technique is.
[31:38.89]It is... Oh boy, we got Slap, we got Chop, and we got Diving Press.
[31:47.10]What the hell?
[31:48.60]Okay, so this is Force.
[31:50.64]They're all D. This one's only a C hit percentage, but it has a C in Sharpness.
[31:57.42]What does that mean?
[32:00.72]So he turns into the Sonic the Hedgehog ball and does the Sonic Dash move.
[32:08.67]This is, we just, we're getting all the Sonic moves here.
[32:13.21]Beanbag slam.
[32:16.25]Is that, that's armor penetration?
[32:19.65]Sharpness equals crit chance, okay.
[32:23.47]Um, that's actually really, withering I'm assuming that's, um, taking their, their, uh, guts down, right?
[32:32.56]Alright.
[32:33.58]That's cool.
[32:34.68]So now we gotta work on hit percentage.
[32:37.18]Let him rest.
[32:38.34]And I might even send him back to training on skill.
[32:40.57]What do you think?
[32:45.51]Alright.
[32:45.91]If the internet goes down, I'm gonna have a big problem.
[32:48.81]You know?
[32:50.33]Still tired.
[32:52.41]I'll have to sleep again.
[32:56.42]Should I do... Alright.
[32:57.50]Go back to training and do power or skill.
[33:01.14]Which one?
[33:05.02]The official tournament's this week.
[33:06.28]He seems... No, I'm not ready for that.
[33:08.84]Sorry, dude.
[33:09.60]Not gonna happen.
[33:12.22]Let's go see if we can get another technique.
[33:13.80]I wish I could sleep for two consecutive weeks.
[33:26.87]Alright, this is power and life.
[33:29.77]It seems that there is some chance to acquire a new technique there.
[33:33.71]Okay.
[33:33.83]Okay.
[33:36.18]Let's check the other ones.
[33:37.44]The other one would be skill and life.
[33:41.04]Let's see.
[33:42.24]It seems that there is a chance to acquire a new technique.
[33:44.28]So what is... I feel like hit percentage is probably more important.
[33:51.76]Ah, we got to do a poll here.
[33:52.82]I have to do a poll here because they're both really important.
[33:55.37]New poll.
[33:56.21]Choose your own monster creation.
[33:58.45]You know what I'm saying?
[34:02.77]Are we going for power or are we going for skill?
[34:09.68]Because I would do either one.
[34:11.68]Let you guys decide.
[34:18.73]Speed again.
[34:22.59]Okay, I'll put speed on it.
[34:24.53]Really?
[34:24.83]Okay, I'll put it on.
[34:37.17]Okay, here's your option.
[34:38.49]Here are your options here.
[34:43.77]There you go.
[34:46.85]So there's your straw poll again.
[34:48.19]Please vote on it if you get a chance.
[34:49.93]If you care.
[34:56.73]Defense?
[34:57.37]Defense is not... Is defense available?
[34:59.27]I don't think it is.
[35:01.65]Is it?
[35:02.69]No.
[35:03.87]Defense is not available.
[35:05.13]I would have put it on the list because I'm definitely not doing intelligence.
[35:09.91]And I'm definitely not doing...
[35:14.72]Power and speed are literally tied.
[35:16.78]Guys, we're going to have to wait here.
[35:18.20]One of you lurkers is going to have to open up that window.
[35:21.09]You know what I'm saying?
[35:26.91]One of you guys that's playing Fortnite on the other monitor, just prone for a second and come vote on this.
[35:31.98]You're going to be alright.
[35:37.96]Hey, there we go.
[35:38.63]Here they come.
[35:43.99]What am I drinking this?
[35:44.73]I'm drinking a coffee.
[35:45.41]I'm drinking a... I'm drinking a CBBB.
[35:47.71]Nah, it looks like Power's gonna win this.
[35:54.84]I'm gonna... It's still not... There's only like 10 votes that are separating this.
[36:00.52]Yeah, it's Dunkin' Donuts.
[36:03.81]Dunkin' Donuts is cheap.
[36:06.05]And it's, you know, it's good enough.
[36:11.51]Nobody has deciphered what that is, by the way.
[36:13.45]This is a CBBB from Dunkin' Donuts.
[36:19.07]Power has climbed ahead.
[36:20.39]I'm going to close this poll in about 10 to 15 seconds.
[36:29.50]I'm hovering over power.
[36:31.46]Because that's what's probably going to win.
[36:34.38]You did?
[36:34.67]No, you didn't.
[36:37.80]Oh shit, yeah, somebody got a Cold Brew Blueberry!
[36:43.19]There you go, somebody fucking got it!
[36:45.99]Cold Brew Blueberry.
[36:50.25]Alright, we got, power it is, thank you for voting.
[36:53.15]Speed is gonna have to do it another time.
[36:55.75]Gonna have to go back later.
[36:59.02]Power!
[37:00.63]possible that there's a chance to acquire a new technique.
[37:03.72]And, um, we'll go with, uh, what on Earth?
[37:07.90]I thought that was a bird.
[37:09.94]Alright, should I go up against Handsome Rock?
[37:16.01]Yeah.
[37:17.11]Just in case we run into, like, Gaston the Rock.
[37:22.29]Let's do it.
[37:30.52]Power.
[37:31.78]Give us another technique.
[37:36.49]How would this be power?
[37:37.47]Wouldn't this be speed?
[37:39.55]Oh, I see.
[37:40.87]It's if you can withstand it.
[37:42.99]He did.
[37:45.15]Wait, here comes another one.
[37:50.25]Oh, no!
[37:50.71]Don't get sucked away!
[37:52.97]Come on!
[37:55.08]No!
[37:56.08]Stay in there!
[37:57.68]Don't let him take you!
[38:03.67]Nice, alright, good.
[38:06.31]New technique, we got one!
[38:07.73]New technique!
[38:10.00]Stage two, what, you're gonna kill a sleeping camel?
[38:13.12]What?
[38:13.30]I don't understand what just happened.
[38:17.52]What are you doing?
[38:24.22]See, I suck, I only have one move right now, chop.
[38:31.35]Oops.
[38:36.01]What's the fail or success rate here?
[38:38.83]What are we trying to do?
[38:39.79]I don't... Okay, does it move the camel?
[38:48.50]I love that little arm throw out thing.
[38:50.11]It's great.
[38:52.01]Nice.
[38:52.99]I guess that means we did it.
[39:01.14]drained oasis.
[39:03.31]And then we're... We've never done one before.
[39:06.53]Full one.
[39:09.29]Is this to make the water come back?
[39:13.87]Come on, let us see the fourth... For the first time ever, let us see the fourth stage.
[39:17.17]Come on.
[39:18.92]You can break it.
[39:25.16]It's almost night time.
[39:28.54]I don't think he did it.
[39:31.85]One more big punch.
[39:34.79]No, he did it!
[39:36.85]He punched the ground coconut enough times for the water to come back!
[39:43.56]Yes!
[39:52.38]Power has increased.
[39:55.38]Alright, now do we fight the monster?
[39:57.25]Huge antlion.
[40:03.40]He's probably so tired by this point.
[40:04.77]He got out.
[40:05.29]Easy.
[40:06.31]Game over.
[40:07.55]Oh, no.
[40:08.93]No, don't.
[40:10.13]Come on.
[40:10.43]Boba Fett got out of this.
[40:13.41]You can do this.
[40:14.11]If some shitty, crappy actor in a dumpy suit can roll around and get out of that, you can too.
[40:19.85]See?
[40:21.97]No, come on.
[40:23.21]What?
[40:23.45]What?
[40:31.48]Who's going to come out on top here?
[40:34.68]Is that it?
[40:36.02]That was a super dev.
[40:41.28]That was great.
[40:50.73]That was a great performance.
[40:54.65]And we got a new tech.
[40:55.89]Finally.
[40:56.87]We can mix and match now.
[41:00.32]That was a dev block.
[41:01.44]Yeah, it was.
[41:02.54]Oh, wait a minute.
[41:03.20]Hellwall?
[41:07.83]What's the Hell Wall?
[41:16.30]I just got into a Minecraft portal.
[41:19.00]This is like an em- what is it called?
[41:20.24]The Ember Portal?
[41:21.20]Do I have to fight it?
[41:24.10]Who's fighting?
[41:32.13]Come on!
[41:33.07]Fight back!
[41:35.11]Beat the Hell Wall!
[41:38.07]Why is there a crowd?
[41:40.79]Oh my god.
[41:42.41]Come on, you could be... Send us to the Ember Dragon!
[41:49.92]Is it just... Is he... Is he... Dodge it!
[41:52.42]Yes!
[41:55.10]Yeah, the good thing the studio audience is here with us.
[41:58.60]I'm not controlling this, by the way.
[41:59.68]This is just happening.
[42:01.56]And there's no timer.
[42:02.24]It's just whoever dies.
[42:03.20]This is the fight to the death.
[42:07.22]By the way, this is, where's Handsome Wall?
[42:09.26]This is Hell Wall.
[42:11.36]We're gonna get some special item here, he's gonna get it.
[42:13.70]Perfect dodge.
[42:16.18]Make it happen, come on, make us proud.
[42:21.34]Ooh!
[42:27.21]I don't know what the, okay, he's fine.
[42:28.81]He needs to get hit one more time.
[42:30.45]Any chop, anything.
[42:33.73]He ends it with his fucking signature move.
[42:47.48]Yep.
[42:48.72]That was cool.
[42:52.66]So what did we get for that?
[42:55.02]We have to get something, right?
[43:01.91]I killed that wall.
[43:02.95]Well, who cares?
[43:03.53]It was called Hell Wall.
[43:04.75]It was a demon.
[43:13.30]Now what?
[43:16.99]Oh, I think it's just... Great beanbag Sonic.
[43:23.45]It's an easy battle to win against those guys.
[43:26.55]Let's go back.
[43:33.80]I got attacked by a... Too bad you didn't catch it.
[43:36.18]What do you mean catch it?
[43:43.05]The prize money!
[43:51.65]Defeated a wild monster.
[43:53.83]It's wonderful, and it's also acquired a new technique.
[43:56.75]Seems pretty strong.
[43:58.49]Praise it.
[43:59.15]We'll praise it this time.
[44:00.01]That was unbelievable.
[44:01.43]It seems very delighted.
[44:02.49]Unbelievable performance.
[44:08.41]Seems pretty... We got money, though.
[44:09.36]Let's check the technique.
[44:12.08]We got like 700 bucks.
[44:13.10]Alright, new power technique.
[44:17.22]It is... Back Blow.
[44:25.13]Heavy tech.
[44:37.34]So what is this?
[44:39.94]I just don't see the... I don't see the reason why you would use this over Chop.
[44:48.28]Besides the fact that it has Withering, but... I mean, it has a less hit percentage.
[44:58.54]I can see this one, for sure.
[45:00.54]But I don't know if I'll use this one that much.
[45:04.22]It's got the same damage as... Unless withering means something different.
[45:11.46]Maybe it gets more scaling?
[45:12.30]Well, you would assume that... See, Force is probably damage, right?
[45:18.57]It does triple the damage, but how can you know that?
[45:21.51]Alright, isn't Force damage?
[45:26.03]Kill Beanbag Sonic.
[45:27.27]Sonic, I'm bored of him.
[45:32.64]Withering scales him down.
[45:33.78]Okay.
[45:34.78]We'll give it a try.
[45:37.02]But it's time for rest.
[45:44.86]Ban that guy.
[45:45.70]No.
[45:47.94]You're allowed to have your opinions.
[45:51.00]So I'm going to say let's do another bout of training.
[45:55.88]I would think... We have the money.
[45:57.76]Let's Jack this guy up.
[46:00.98]Cup of jelly.
[46:04.79]We'll have about 800 bucks.
[46:16.54]How am I gonna recreate him for Gervania?
[46:20.20]He's stressed out.
[46:20.80]Alright, let's get... Hold on.
[46:22.52]I got just the thing for stress, man.
[46:24.85]Come here.
[46:27.85]We've got mint leaf.
[46:30.01]Take it.
[46:31.43]Relax a little bit.
[46:32.73]De-stress.
[46:37.28]This time, just do skill.
[46:40.55]Alright, let's go to training.
[46:43.89]Errantry.
[46:44.37]Good.
[46:48.53]Choose the location.
[46:49.45]Quick.
[46:52.15]Skill seems like the correct answer, but I'm gonna leave it up to you guys again.
[46:56.25]So... I hope you guys choose wisely.
[46:58.75]Let's get another Fallout.
[47:05.82]Same exact thing.
[47:09.21]Power, skill, or speed.
[47:14.80]I would... If I were you, if I were me, and I am, I would probably pick skill.
[47:21.94]But we'll see if you guys are me, you know?
[47:27.64]I'm curious if you guys are gonna be me or not.
[47:30.85]Looks like it's gonna be close, regardless.
[47:38.65]Biased opinions.
[47:39.67]Well, I mean, he needs it.
[47:41.69]He has like 130.
[47:42.41]He's gonna miss every hit.
[47:44.66]He'll miss every swing.
[47:46.12]We have all these cool abilities.
[47:48.26]It would be a shame if we didn't land any of them.
[47:59.10]Rigged by the streamer.
[48:05.70]Biased opinions to sway polls.
[48:08.22]You guys got your own minds.
[48:12.03]Just think of me as like a political ad that you see on TV.
[48:15.23]Did you scoff at me?
[48:16.19]Were you like, oh, please.
[48:17.61]Did you roll your eyes?
[48:19.11]Or were you like, yes, I think so too.
[48:31.50]Looks like we're going to do skill.
[48:36.17]Skill it is.
[48:38.97]Thank you for voting.
[48:41.43]Looks like it's out of reach at this point.
[48:43.11]Skill time.
[48:45.53]2,000.
[48:46.23]And there's a chance to get a technique here as well.
[48:51.58]Let's go with... How about Norty?
[48:54.98]You know, like Garfield Morty.
[48:58.32]Hey, Morty, remember that time we went to the multiverse?
[49:00.64]We found you as Garfield Norty?
[49:02.88]Morty?
[49:03.12]Haha!
[49:04.78]Remember that funny episode that they did?
[49:06.36]They found, like, Morty Garfield, you know what I'm saying?
[49:11.74]Alright, watermelon.
[49:12.42]Let's go.
[49:23.59]Oh, cut that part out.
[49:24.45]Yeah, we're not gonna use that.
[49:29.95]Split that.
[49:31.37]New tech.
[49:34.04]Look at the light bulb!
[49:34.64]Look at Morty!
[49:35.02]Look at the light bulb, Morty!
[49:40.50]Hey Morty!
[49:53.81]He made it. Ah! Yes he did!
[50:10.58]Oh no, hungry sharks!
[50:13.55]Punch him!
[50:15.61]I'm gonna do it again.
[50:16.33]I'm gonna do Morty again.
[50:18.69]I don't fucking care if everybody hates it.
[50:20.24]I'm doing it again.
[50:21.38]I'm gonna do it even louder this time.
[50:23.22]I'm gonna do it as loud as I can.
[50:24.24]I'm gonna scream it.
[50:38.85]Gigantic crab.
[50:40.04]Oh, wait, hold on.
[50:40.66]There's a giant enemy crab here?
[50:44.86]Wow.
[50:46.96]You gotta get it right.
[50:47.94]This is tough.
[50:48.76]I've done this in the fucking... I've done this in the supermarket before.
[50:50.72]You gotta pick the right crab.
[50:54.06]Nice.
[50:54.78]One hit.
[50:55.98]That's a 4v.
[51:00.02]Ancient memes.
[51:00.90]Yeah.
[51:01.24]Wait a minute.
[51:01.70]The crab... There's an even bigger giant enemy crab.
[51:06.47]He'll get it.
[51:07.01]He doesn't even need to look.
[51:12.15]Bingo.
[51:19.39]Is he gonna go... Dodge?
[51:22.55]Ooh!
[51:26.47]You are so good at everything.
[51:28.51]I will never delete this character.
[51:30.55]He just beat the giant enemy crab.
[51:34.31]And he did massive damage.
[51:35.81]Alright.
[51:36.69]Cut that part out.
[51:37.91]You can cut it there.
[51:38.83]When I said enemy crab.
[51:40.23]You can cut that part out.
[51:48.14]Fuck, I'm about to do this.
[51:50.36]I'm gonna do it.
[51:51.12]I'm gonna lose 100 viewers.
[51:54.09]No, I'm not.
[51:55.07]I'm not gonna do it.
[51:56.93]I was gonna do Rick and Morty Rick, but talking about giant enemy crabs.
[52:02.53]No.
[52:03.55]But we gotta bust the bunny from Tiny Toon Adventures.
[52:07.48]Take it on!
[52:12.06]No control.
[52:12.88]He's got a mind of his own.
[52:14.18]Nice dodge.
[52:15.02]Good boo.
[52:20.58]What the fuck was that move?
[52:24.74]Did we learn this move?
[52:26.20]Look at this thing!
[52:27.72]Calm down, Jeremy.
[52:33.22]You didn't just scratch off a scratch ticket and win $100.
[52:36.89]This is clearly... It's alright.
[52:42.13]And that's it.
[52:42.57]Backhanded.
[52:43.09]68 damage.
[52:43.89]He's unstoppable now.
[52:53.72]Finish him.
[52:55.78]Come on.
[53:05.57]Come on.
[53:06.35]What are you doing?
[53:07.05]Don't make me do Rick again.
[53:08.19]Nice.
[53:11.57]Nice.
[53:11.91]Fucking scrub-a-dub-dub in the tub.
[53:13.37]Wubba lubba scrub-dub.
[53:21.12]I'm sorry.
[53:21.76]I can't help it.
[53:22.42]Sometimes I just have to do this.
[53:27.70]Let me tell you something.
[53:28.74]Let's talk about Rick and Morty, because I'm going to talk about it.
[53:31.44]You guys remember when everybody thought Family Guy was funny, right?
[53:36.29]I'm serious.
[53:36.81]Listen to me.
[53:37.45]This is important.
[53:38.27]Open your ears.
[53:39.75]Like, Family Guy was funny, you know, for the first six or seven seasons.
[53:43.97]It was like a funny show.
[53:45.83]And then, like, it started to get, like, bad.
[53:49.02]It wasn't, like, funny anymore.
[53:50.06]But, like, the middle seasons of Family Guy weren't that awful either, right?
[53:55.27]Family Guy's never funny.
[53:56.55]No, Family Guy was funny.
[53:58.23]Family Guy was funny.
[54:00.29]It's just, yes, it was.
[54:04.98]Like, Rick and Morty is a funny show.
[54:07.40]Don't let the people that love Rick and Morty ruin the show for you.
[54:11.58]You know what I'm saying?
[54:12.86]Just because there was a bunch of people screaming about Szechuan sauce outside McDonald's doesn't mean that Justin Roiland's not a funny comedian.
[54:18.81]You know what I'm saying?
[54:28.25]American Dad was a funny show.
[54:34.79]I'm not even... I'm not a Rick and Morty fan.
[54:38.26]I'm just saying, like, I chuckled at a few things in Rick and Morty.
[54:40.94]I think a lot of the stuff is a little over the top for me.
[54:44.70]But yes, there was a bunch of people that went to McDonald's.
[54:46.76]You guys all went to McDonald's and you screamed about Szechuan sauce.
[54:50.79]And like, everybody hated the show now.
[54:52.37]You know what I mean?
[54:53.57]Like, that like, spicy sauce joke made everybody hate that show.
[54:59.65]That show was, everybody praised it for being one of the funniest shows on TV.
[55:03.15]Oh, Rick and Morty is a fucking such a funny show.
[55:05.49]I love it.
[55:06.39]I love that quote.
[55:07.53]And then like six months later, get that fucking show out of here.
[55:10.68]That show's stupid.
[55:12.08]Pickle Rick is just shoving up your ass.
[55:14.00]Like, the opinion changed.
[55:18.29]A goddamn McDonald's sauce turned everybody off from that show.
[55:23.43]And like a shitty Reddit post about a guy talking about IQ points.
[55:38.77]Praise him.
[55:40.66]Fucking sauce.
[55:41.46]McDonald's had like a gross sauce ten years ago.
[55:44.68]And now everybody hates that show.
[55:57.12]It's gonna happen to you too.
[56:06.63]Look, I'm just kidding.
[56:07.35]Family Guy sucks.
[56:09.39]American Dad's funny.
[56:14.87]Wait a minute, though.
[56:15.35]Let's talk about this.
[56:15.91]We're gonna collect our jelly points.
[56:18.73]What's going on here?
[56:20.01]Talk about cartoon animation shows, right?
[56:24.02]Animated television.
[56:26.05]Why is it now all of a sudden, why is everybody, I'm talking even from Family Guy forward, why does everybody have to have a funny, evil baby now?
[56:32.62]Why does there have to be a highly intelligent, evil toddler in every animated sitcom now?
[56:38.88]Why?
[56:40.78]They're all following that Simpsons formula.
[56:43.28]Big, dumb, idiot dad.
[56:46.45]Dorky son or dorky daughter.
[56:51.04]A mother that's holding it all together, and a crazy baby that has waved him way more than meets the eye.
[56:57.02]Can we stop doing that?
[57:06.55]We need to de-stress him.
[57:20.85]Can you focus?
[57:22.39]We're derailing for a second, it's alright.
[57:25.89]Okay, who would I be in the Seth MacFarlane makes the same show over and over again?
[57:30.32]Who would I be?
[57:30.76]Would I be like the dorky son?
[57:33.38]Would I be the crazy baby?
[57:34.70]What do you think?
[57:45.10]Bob's Burgers is a good show, that's right, but they don't necessarily follow the exact, they follow the formula slightly.
[57:51.87]But not exactly.
[57:54.43]Still a bunch of children that are making all kinds of trouble.
[57:57.68]But the children are actually, you know, interesting in that show, you know?
[58:06.34]We get half off again.
[58:20.92]The reason why I like Bob's Burgers is because I like... I liked home movies.
[58:26.87]And that's the same people, right?
[58:28.99]Or the same, like, at least three or four heads that created that show.
[58:35.54]Home movies had its... I loved... Home movies was great just to have on the background.
[58:41.20]It was a great little thing.
[58:47.93]Brendan's... What the fuck was that?
[58:55.80]That's just kind of like a... That was a text I've never even heard that sound before.
[59:02.42]Oh, I don't want to feed him another... Let's buy a bunch of mint leaves.
[59:07.95]Home Movies was great.
[59:08.71]It was awesome.
[59:14.77]Great discount.
[59:15.37]Let's get like two or three of those mint leaves.
[59:22.66]Only 20% off, Grandma.
[59:23.63]You suck.
[59:24.61]What are you, a Family Guy fan?
[59:27.95]You look like Peter Griffin.
[59:30.35]This could be like a Peter Griffin character.
[59:34.77]Dressed up in a costume, you know?
[59:36.01]Remember when I was in the 1600s?
[59:37.79]Yeah, that could be a fucking Peter Griffin character.
[59:47.28]I think that's good.
[59:54.91]Hey Lois, look at this, ha ha.
[59:58.50]Peter voice, ha ha.
[60:00.77]You know what's funny?
[60:01.41]Like, when you go to, uh, YouTube, like, everybody, I don't know why this is, here's another thing we could talk, like, I know we're, we're, like, derailing for a little bit here, but, like, you know impressions on YouTube?
[60:11.15]People that, check me doing these animated characters!
[60:14.61]Every single one of those, every single person that has one of those videos with a do a impression reel on YouTube for voice acting, it's every Family Guy character and, like, maybe a few others.
[60:26.89]They do their Peter Griffin.
[60:28.05]They do their Joe, you know.
[60:29.75]They do their, hey, it's me, Joe.
[60:31.70]Hey, I'm Joe.
[60:32.86]Everyone does that one.
[60:34.02]That's not even hard to do.
[60:35.66]Peter.
[60:36.76]Peter.
[60:37.36]It's me, Joe.
[60:38.50]Peter.
[60:39.92]You can do that right now.
[60:40.66]Go for it.
[60:40.98]Try it.
[60:42.04]Just do it in your hand.
[60:43.14]Cover your mouth and do it in your hand.
[60:44.54]You can do it.
[60:47.04]And then they just say, that is Stewie Griffin.
[60:48.40]Everyone does a Stewie Griffin.
[60:50.93]I can do a Stewie Griffin.
[60:52.09]Pretty well, I think.
[60:54.75]Idiot.
[60:55.43]See, I can do that.
[60:58.98]These are not that difficult to do.
[61:00.64]Oh, is that the real Stu- Okay.
[61:19.66]I'm gonna do an impression reel and it's gonna- Donald Trump has to be on there because it's relevant, right?
[61:24.02]Even if your Trump sucks.
[61:25.10]My Trump is not that good.
[61:29.52]He just has to be on there, and people will go, oh man, that kind of sounds like something he would say.
[61:33.85]He doesn't even need to be correct.
[61:38.35]Believe me.
[61:39.43]That's all you have to say is believe me.
[61:41.15]That's it, and somebody will clap.
[61:44.23]If you do that in an audience, next time you're at an open mic night, go up to the stage, stand up there,
[61:53.13]And fucking, you know, oh, hey, what's your name?
[61:55.51]Dan, Dan, come on up.
[61:56.59]Hey, how you doing?
[61:57.09]Nice to meet you guys.
[61:57.73]I'm Dan from Waterville.
[62:01.15]Nice to see everybody.
[62:02.17]Okay.
[62:03.59]Believe me.
[62:07.46]Somebody in the back will do, even if people don't like you, there'll be like three people that just like will laugh at that and clap.
[62:13.14]And you can just walk off stage and just collect like eight bucks.
[62:22.25]It's not hard.
[62:28.22]Your baby is crying.
[62:29.56]Want me to go to open mic night and do that?
[62:34.72]I will.
[62:37.53]I would love to do that and film it.
[62:38.57]I'm going to do it.
[62:39.69]And I will watch it on stream.
[62:44.95]I swear to God.
[62:46.25]I'm going to find out when the next open mic night is.
[62:48.47]I'm going to go up there and I'm going to do that and I'm going to walk off the stage.
[62:51.86]And I want to see how many people clap.
[62:54.44]And how many people think that was hilarious.
[62:58.04]There it is.
[62:58.44]Shockwave.
[62:59.02]Holy shit.
[62:59.72]I'm so happy about this.
[63:11.74]Jeremiah embarrasses himself.
[63:13.20]Well, I don't care.
[63:14.58]I don't care about being... I don't get embarrassed by much anymore.
[63:20.38]That's pretty cool, though.
[63:22.56]I like it.
[63:24.34]A hit percentage.
[63:25.48]It's a nice hit tech.
[63:31.46]And I have to laugh afterwards at my own joke.
[63:35.06]And then just, like, fumble with the mic and, like, drop it a little bit and then, like, smile and then put it back in and walk off.
[63:45.07]I should go back every week and do it at the same place.
[63:57.86]You got embarrassed by JermaCraft.
[64:02.23]No, I got angry at JermaCraft, because it was... it was stupid.
[64:06.09]They would kick you out?
[64:10.67]No they wouldn't, it's open mic night.
[64:13.61]You just have to sign up.
[64:15.02]As long as you don't do anything bad, or say something terrible, or like do something illegal.
[64:19.38]You can do whatever you want.
[64:22.62]Alright, so what we got?
[64:24.28]We have a bee cup here, bee tournament here.
[64:28.52]I don't think... I need to do C first.
[64:30.14]So here's the official cup.
[64:32.14]We're going to go for this one.
[64:33.02]So we're going to do train, train, or train, rest.
[64:36.34]And we'll try it.
[64:43.75]So how's he doing?
[64:44.33]Let's go with training.
[64:47.01]Is he stressed out?
[64:48.69]No.
[64:52.24]Yeah, I think he's a little bit stressed.
[64:54.30]Okay, I've been completely off-topic and derailed from the game here.
[64:57.74]Have I given him a Menleaf?
[65:03.02]I know I bought a couple, but I was too busy talking about how every cartoon is a Seth MacFarlane cartoon.
[65:07.43]And then I said that Family Guy was kind of funny and everybody hated me for it.
[65:15.59]No.
[65:18.69]We'll rest and then I'll give it to him.
[65:30.65]Give us mint.
[65:32.97]Beanbag as well.
[65:38.69]Family goes to rip off of The Simpsons.
[65:40.36]Yeah.
[65:44.32]But The Simpsons had the intelligent baby thing down pretty well, I think.
[65:47.94]Like, Maggie was still a baby.
[65:52.27]Sometimes she just did crazy things and you were like, wow, Maggie can actually, like, Maggie can drive a car?
[65:58.38]When did that happen?
[65:59.36]Maggie did a bunch of cra- Maggie is the one that killed Smithers?
[66:04.94]What the fuck?
[66:05.78]It was like, wow.
[66:08.58]Imagine if Maggie every episode was like, let me tell you something.
[66:11.92]Oh, I'm so intelligent.
[66:12.94]Like, it would be like, Maggie, shut up.
[66:16.39]Spoilers.
[66:19.58]That episode is like 22 years old.
[66:22.72]I'm spoiling a television show that is 25 fucking years old.
[66:36.92]You guys want to know how the Odyssey ends?
[66:39.80]The book?
[66:40.36]That was written fucking like 40 years ago.
[66:45.44]I'm catching up.
[66:46.36]It happened before I was born.
[66:48.40]What?
[67:00.66]The Simpsons is so old!
[67:02.88]Why would you go back and watch those episodes?
[67:05.66]No, wait a minute, that's wrong.
[67:07.12]Why wouldn't you?
[67:07.70]Treehouse of Horror was great, like, 20 years ago.
[67:09.96]It's one of my favorite things ever.
[67:14.46]Alright, come on, like, look.
[67:15.70]I may have... I didn't spoil anything, because apparently I was incorrect.
[67:18.80]That didn't happen.
[67:21.95]We have a battle to do.
[67:23.01]We're gonna do... We're gonna... Let's just do a drill, and then...
[67:35.80]We'll do speed.
[67:41.10]Someone's just like, play the fucking game.
[67:54.22]We're just relaxing, we're just fucking hanging out.
[67:56.55]We're gonna be streaming for like six hours tonight.
[68:03.23]We got time, don't worry.
[68:07.65]Alright, I wanna do... Is he well?
[68:09.15]He's well, yeah, he is.
[68:10.53]Let's give it a try.
[68:23.36]I think we have a pretty decent opportunity.
[68:31.82]Six hours of this?
[68:35.85]I am playing the game.
[68:36.79]Alright, now you guys are just doing it to be mean.
[68:39.39]I literally am still, I'm like in the process of loading screens to play the video game.
[68:44.11]Plus, Monster Rancher doesn't, you know, everything's gonna be fine.
[68:50.89]Six hour fan, look at this huge tournament, by the way.
[68:53.43]Now we got, we're going up against Huey.
[69:01.83]Let's take a look.
[69:04.60]Opponent Huey seems pretty bad.
[69:06.90]Beware of his bad techniques.
[69:12.44]Let's go.
[69:19.59]Don't talk.
[69:20.15]I'm only here for the intense ranching.
[69:21.89]Well, he's really smart, but he's not strong.
[69:26.09]So we should be alright.
[69:26.93]Let's crush him.
[69:28.85]Really high speed.
[69:31.33]Oh, this is Garfield.
[69:32.08]Okay.
[69:37.32]Now let's do, we got backblow.
[69:39.56]Okay.
[69:40.80]Well.
[69:43.02]That's only a 22% chance to hit.
[69:52.01]30% chance.
[69:54.17]It's gonna be so hard to hit this guy.
[69:56.42]Come on, give us a big one.
[69:57.48]Nice!
[70:00.08]I'm gonna, now I'm gonna go back to chop.
[70:09.08]Damn it.
[70:09.80]Come on.
[70:10.40]Change it up.
[70:11.20]We have to do slap.
[70:13.56]Yeah, these are all... His speed is way too high.
[70:18.22]I gotta get in closer, though.
[70:20.12]Get in there.
[70:24.83]Come on.
[70:25.31]Hit him again.
[70:25.73]We're good.
[70:26.91]There it is.
[70:27.29]Can I knock him out?
[70:34.30]There it is.
[70:34.58]See you later.
[70:41.58]That guy had a lot of moves.
[70:42.56]Changing... The thing that I don't... Alright.
[70:45.40]Monster Rancher's... I can't even say words.
[70:48.56]Monster Rancher 1's changing out moves was a little more intuitive.
[70:55.03]You have to hit L1, R1, square.
[70:57.07]It's kind of weird.
[70:59.77]But, you know.
[71:01.51]Oh, gun burns here.
[71:09.13]Well, we have to eventually fight him, so...
[71:14.65]Zamber versus Nicole.
[71:21.65]Okay.
[71:26.84]Oh, it's one of our human centipede buddies.
[71:34.44]Alright, versus Recknen.
[71:36.44]Let's see.
[71:39.12]Very high speed.
[71:43.18]Is it as big as mine?
[71:51.17]Nicole just shat on Jax Rex.
[71:56.51]You're not that tough.
[71:58.83]We'll see who the better mound of shit is here.
[72:01.03]It's going to be me.
[72:03.07]Yeah, I pretty much got him in every category here.
[72:12.72]Nice.
[72:15.34]Gotta get him closer.
[72:16.06]Beautiful.
[72:23.57]Why is slap just the best move?
[72:25.35]It really is.
[72:30.81]Come on, give me that coin flip once.
[72:33.49]Good dodge.
[72:35.81]I got that too, you know.
[72:40.23]Not good.
[72:47.58]We got the same.
[72:48.22]It's a mirror match.
[72:54.38]Right again.
[72:54.68]Do it again.
[72:54.96]Quick.
[72:58.06]That should be a victory here.
[72:59.32]Three times the charm?
[73:00.92]I got confused.
[73:08.64]Shit.
[73:09.84]It's alright.
[73:10.50]It's a win.
[73:16.26]Victory.
[73:21.55]Trust no one, not even yourself.
[73:25.17]Going good so far.
[73:28.53]Just hope that Gunburn loses to somebody for some stupid reason.
[73:32.20]Because he's probably going to beat us.
[73:34.74]Ooh, he lost!
[73:35.34]Okay.
[73:40.29]We just need him to lose again.
[73:41.83]And we just can't lose.
[73:50.07]Warano.
[73:51.23]Wario.
[73:56.96]Uh, we unfortunately have bigger problems.
[73:58.82]Waranmo.
[74:02.52]It's currently 2-0.
[74:03.20]Now, this is the guy that beat Gunburn, so we have to be careful here.
[74:10.07]Uh, let's see what he's got.
[74:13.33]Oh, shit.
[74:13.85]Wait, ah, damn, ah, it's a...
[74:16.82]I wanted to go back and look at his stats, but... He is now in direct control of his own life.
[74:22.11]That's why he beat him, because he's insane.
[74:25.21]I am not controlling him anymore.
[74:27.75]He's taking his own instructions.
[74:29.69]Unfortunately, I have no control.
[74:33.73]And that's not good.
[74:34.65]That's a fireball in the face.
[74:41.16]Come on, yeah.
[74:42.08]All you gotta do is the slap...
[74:45.58]Don't spam changing moves.
[74:47.56]Just do something.
[74:53.10]Alright, good.
[74:53.86]Very good.
[74:54.34]Very good.
[74:54.98]The computer gets kind of confused.
[75:03.31]Got it!
[75:03.65]Come on!
[75:05.01]Come on!
[75:10.01]The AI is better.
[75:13.77]Well, the AI is kind of just doing this thing where it's just finding with an algorithm.
[75:19.57]See?
[75:19.83]Like, I would've- I would've swung.
[75:21.03]Like, you know what I mean?
[75:21.59]Like, that- What the- The AI is better than me?
[75:24.21]What is it doing?
[75:25.82]It's got like three chances!
[75:26.96]Like, oh, AI is better, huh?
[75:29.62]It just lost us the game.
[75:30.96]Look!
[75:31.48]It just lost us the fucking game!
[75:36.76]I got really, really, really lucky.
[75:43.07]That was extremely lucky.
[75:59.92]Lucky.
[76:02.66]Streamer getting outsourced by AI.
[76:04.70]Yeah, really.
[76:08.81]He doesn't even need me anymore.
[76:14.70]I'll just sit here and be like, yeah, good job.
[76:16.24]You did a great work there.
[76:19.00]On the person that's 3-0, just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[76:26.32]We need... Gunburn is the one that's going to cause a lot of problems for us.
[76:29.70]So Gunburn has to lose another round.
[76:34.78]Alright, here we go.
[76:35.22]This is going to be tricky.
[76:38.42]Waranmo.
[76:40.12]What do we got on this dude?
[76:43.08]Has high life.
[76:45.68]We're hitting him with heavy moves.
[76:49.90]Let me take control here.
[76:51.70]Take the reins.
[76:57.56]It's banana spit.
[77:01.50]Okay.
[77:06.20]He's got a lot of power.
[77:08.44]Skill's not perfect, but I'm faster.
[77:10.90]He's got a little bit more defense.
[77:12.04]I just gotta hit him with heavy shit.
[77:19.20]Right off the bat he threw.
[77:20.00]He just threw like shit at me.
[77:23.68]Don't get confused right now, man.
[77:28.66]Dodged it?
[77:30.50]62% dodge, really?
[77:35.34]Don't let him just throw his dumps at you.
[77:37.72]Hit him with a shockwave.
[77:38.64]Thank you.
[77:40.74]Heavy.
[77:41.70]Heavy moves.
[77:43.33]We're really gonna drain that HP.
[77:44.93]Follow it up with a bounce.
[77:45.67]Oh, you dummy.
[77:53.94]Get it again.
[77:56.80]And now I gotta be careful, because I'm out of guts.
[77:59.70]Dodge!
[78:03.02]Come on!
[78:04.84]No!
[78:06.12]Nice.
[78:06.56]Missed the sneeze.
[78:07.20]Shockwave.
[78:09.78]Nooooooooooo!
[78:15.74]Damn it.
[78:16.02]I think it's okay.
[78:16.68]I think we win percentage-wise.
[78:20.86]Yep.
[78:21.02]We're good.
[78:27.95]Forno?
[78:33.45]Again, Gunburn has to lose.
[78:37.33]Come on.
[78:41.90]Yes!
[78:44.42]Now our victory is certain!
[78:53.56]How would you lose that bad to Huey?
[79:00.08]Who have we not faced?
[79:01.20]This worm.
[79:11.75]It's 2 and 2.
[79:16.85]High life.
[79:17.75]Same deal.
[79:19.87]Strong attacks.
[79:21.31]I don't know how Gunburn is not Forno.
[79:28.30]I don't.
[79:33.25]Oh boy, yeah.
[79:34.45]I mean, he's got high speed and high skill, but if I land one, he's got a lot of health.
[79:43.87]I might not be able to hit him with these.
[79:44.89]Triple shots.
[79:51.08]Yeah, see, this is going to be tricky here.
[80:00.06]Big hits.
[80:02.00]There it is.
[80:05.41]Hit it!
[80:06.27]Yes!
[80:08.85]Can't back it up, let's try to get his shockwave again.
[80:13.10]It doesn't do very much damage, but that's good.
[80:20.64]Come on, really?
[80:23.59]Not good.
[80:26.39]Not good.
[80:27.47]Not good!
[80:28.19]Come on now!
[80:35.93]Just, I'm not a good match right here.
[80:39.45]I might be able to win for the percentage here.
[80:41.07]Do it again.
[80:43.67]Shit, it's gonna be close.
[80:45.41]Dodge it!
[80:46.19]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[80:48.13]No.
[80:53.33]He just had too much health.
[80:55.11]Too much health and too much speed.
[80:56.35]It's alright.
[81:02.82]That's the only loss we'll probably take.
[81:07.88]430 health like 300 speed that's just you're essentially playing a game of attrition at that point I always have to win one more time Give him steroids No, if you give them like drugs it brings their lifespan down
[81:40.19]Now this one is... she's... good.
[81:46.93]Three and two, we're four and one.
[81:48.79]Wait, are we tied?
[81:58.37]Bad defense.
[81:59.13]But look at that speed and skill.
[82:00.31]It's just... This is just a... It's just the one... You're just not going to win this one.
[82:04.40]He's not going to win it.
[82:05.82]Our skill is low.
[82:08.68]340 speed.
[82:09.38]I'm going to be hitting that like 40% on every move.
[82:13.38]Just have to get lucky and hit it with a few things.
[82:24.88]That's not lucky.
[82:27.59]Neither is that!
[82:38.17]Stay in close.
[82:44.90]Stay in close.
[82:50.36]Get in there!
[82:50.92]I'm gonna do it.
[82:56.37]Go!
[82:57.61]Gotta hit her with something!
[82:58.91]She's just... close the gap!
[83:00.01]35%!
[83:00.11]Hit it!
[83:02.07]Come on!
[83:06.41]Don't let it get that far away from you!
[83:09.47]Slap!
[83:11.05]Again!
[83:16.39]Again!
[83:18.43]What?!
[83:20.29]We got it.
[83:20.73]We win.
[83:25.02]Turn him over.
[83:29.07]Stop brute forcing?
[83:30.03]Oh, you have to brute force.
[83:31.45]Somebody that's like this, you gotta stay in close and just hope you get a percentage.
[83:35.49]Otherwise, if I go back and do some of my power moves, it's like 30-40%.
[83:37.91]It's alright, turn it over, we win.
[83:45.10]Gunburn sucks.
[83:49.78]Yeah, let's see.
[83:50.56]Yeah, even if I lose, the next match doesn't matter.
[83:56.76]I am the only one that's only lost one time.
[84:01.25]Yes.
[84:02.72]Has anybody only lost twice?
[84:04.44]Yes.
[84:04.86]No.
[84:05.52]I'm good.
[84:17.17]So this is the last match.
[84:18.53]I think it doesn't matter if I lose this or not.
[84:20.90]Because he would be four and... He'd be four and four.
[84:23.98]Or four and three.
[84:25.42]I would be five and two.
[84:27.84]Yeah, I'd win the tournament regardless.
[84:31.69]Yep.
[84:33.89]This is just for fun.
[84:35.95]Doesn't even matter.
[84:36.55]I already clinched it.
[84:45.42]Give it to the AI.
[84:46.42]No.
[84:48.41]We're good.
[84:51.13]Just got to get lucky.
[84:51.91]I'm going to just get in close.
[84:54.11]He's in high intelligence.
[84:56.77]Don't want to be right in that way.
[84:59.57]Just stomp on his head.
[85:01.03]See?
[85:01.31]Didn't want to be there.
[85:03.81]Just get a good head stomper.
[85:17.62]Shockwave, okay.
[85:19.72]There we go.
[85:20.30]That's all we needed to do.
[85:22.52]Now we should just win the game.
[85:24.78]I'm probably gonna lose.
[85:26.72]This guy's just the bane of my existence.
[85:36.73]Come on, one more hit and then we get percentages.
[85:40.03]Get it!
[85:41.23]No!
[85:42.46]No, get in there!
[85:45.24]Come on!
[85:47.93]No, we lose.
[85:48.69]No, we didn't.
[85:51.93]Why?
[85:52.57]That did no damage.
[85:53.29]Oh, that's such horseshit.
[85:55.71]Give me a break.
[85:57.61]You can dodge every fucking... We still won.
[86:00.47]But, like, that's... Come on.
[86:02.97]No, we didn't.
[86:03.35]We lost.
[86:03.65]No, I don't want to back up, because he has intelligence moves, and if he does one to me, it'll do, like, 80 damage.
[86:14.28]If I back up and we get separated, and he does his intelligence move, it will take me, it'll kill me.
[86:24.23]The tournament's over.
[86:25.19]We win.
[86:29.66]Yeah, we got a train skill.
[86:30.76]It's just, there's no... No way around it.
[86:39.10]Give it to the AI.
[86:39.98]He would have fucking taken it home.
[86:51.11]See, right now I'm just sitting there.
[86:52.63]I'm shaking hands right now.
[86:54.35]Backstage.
[86:56.23]While these people are like fighting for their lives, Beanbag Sonic is just like high-fiving, getting the t-shirts printed for the C cup champion.
[87:09.67]There it is.
[87:11.55]Moving on to B. Which Monster Rancher do you like better?
[87:23.27]I like the monsters in this one better.
[87:27.97]But I like the... I like the first game's work more.
[87:33.87]I like being able to make that extra little cash by training them.
[87:37.52]Only six fans?
[87:39.82]For all that work I did here?
[87:40.84]Come on.
[87:45.56]The only complaint I really have is I liked being able to make money while the monster trained.
[87:53.21]And yes, I'm absolutely going to play the third one.
[87:56.45]Not so sure about the fourth one, though, but definitely going to play the one on PS2.
[88:03.30]I think Beanbag Sonic has learned a lesson.
[88:05.62]Let's see.
[88:08.14]That's alright.
[88:10.37]We definitely need to do some skill.
[88:15.11]Good work.
[88:19.83]I want soil.
[88:22.14]What?
[88:24.52]Do you want to give it soil?
[88:27.96]Why does he want to eat dirt?
[88:32.98]Should I do this?
[88:37.34]That looks like a shitty burrito.
[88:38.83]I want a hot pocket.
[88:42.99]I want a steak and cheese hot pocket.
[88:44.55]Okay.
[88:48.53]You want it?
[88:49.03]Sure.
[88:49.55]You can have it.
[88:51.87]Take it.
[88:59.09]He's gonna take up gardening.
[89:03.79]Which food do you want to give it?
[89:04.62]I just gave it dirt.
[89:06.64]Wow, that's not... That doesn't... That's not good.
[89:11.72]That's not healthy and nutritious.
[89:13.34]Why am I so annoyed by that?
[89:16.22]What the hell?
[89:16.70]I just fed this animal dirt and it wants more food from me?
[89:20.14]Should we give him meat?
[89:27.44]Yeah.
[89:30.15]Does Sonic like meat, though?
[89:35.07]He didn't like tablets, right?
[89:40.54]It's expensive.
[89:46.26]He played with the dirt.
[89:55.78]Eat this meat.
[90:01.53]He deserves it.
[90:02.85]He's won three tournaments without losing.
[90:04.62]He deserves it.
[90:09.32]Here's the mail from Aima.
[90:10.40]Now I would assume at this point we can open the rare monsters.
[90:15.55]Back to town.
[90:18.21]We'll see if we can unlock some more monsters.
[90:25.57]Because now we're at rank three.
[90:28.72]Get out of the way!
[90:31.24]Third rank.
[90:31.70]There we go.
[90:34.86]Okay, it said, once you achieve the third rank, you're considered to be a professional.
[90:39.06]We've made it to the first milestone.
[90:41.03]There.
[90:42.99]So, now we have to be able to do what we want to do here.
[90:49.87]We're gonna save, we're gonna freeze him, and we're just gonna go play around with some of all the CDs.
[90:56.99]He's very well.
[90:57.75]Good.
[90:58.72]Save the game.
[91:01.46]That was a great camera cut, by the way.
[91:05.59]Saved and finished.
[91:12.15]Let me look at the data.
[91:18.24]He's one year, seven months.
[91:22.28]He's doing great.
[91:25.02]He likes to play.
[91:29.31]Alright, he's doing good.
[91:29.85]I just want to see how old he was.
[91:31.51]He's just about two years old.
[91:36.43]To town.
[91:39.86]Fuse it with the first thing you get.
[91:41.28]Yeah, the first thing I get.
[91:43.94]I don't care what it is, it's instantly getting fused with Sonic.
[91:48.20]And I'm deleting my Twitch account.
[91:53.54]All the material.
[91:56.75]Alright, let's go to lab.
[92:00.66]Put him on ice for a little bit.
[92:02.40]He'll be okay, don't worry.
[92:03.36]I know it's sad to say this, but it's okay.
[92:08.66]I know everyone's going to be sad about this, but he's fine.
[92:19.83]Alright, now let me just go to the bathroom.
[92:21.87]Let me take a pee break.
[92:24.95]And we will go from here.
[92:28.00]Alright, let's go here be time to take a pee Anybody know I'll see you in a minute
[94:46.99]I got nothing else to drink.
[94:55.23]This sucks.
[94:57.31]Oh well.
[94:58.77]Sometimes you gotta deal with it, right?
[95:01.53]Sometimes you just gotta deal with it.
[95:08.28]Remember your wall monster promise?
[95:09.84]What was my wall monster promise last night?
[95:13.54]I don't remember what it was.
[95:17.18]Anyways, I wonder if... You guys have, like, read this before.
[95:21.84]I don't need to put it in.
[95:23.90]What the fuck is in here?
[95:25.16]Okay.
[95:27.62]No, we'll do this.
[95:28.10]Let's see if we can... No, no.
[95:30.00]Just... Where's my CD case?
[95:31.56]There it is.
[95:34.48]Alright, let's go to the shrine.
[95:35.76]See if we can pull out some of these rare monsters in quotes.
[95:40.16]Start from the last one we did.
[95:43.72]Which was.
[95:44.22]I couldn't see.
[95:47.26]Here it is.
[95:51.65]Gunfighter.
[95:53.45]Legend of Jesse James.
[95:57.37]Gunfighter.
[95:58.15]Let's put it in.
[96:00.91]Why am I turning the camera on?
[96:03.55]For what reason?
[96:05.93]So I can show you the disk.
[96:09.15]Face cams.
[96:09.75]I'm not doing a facecam.
[96:16.00]Face cams are just, like, somebody staring into your face.
[96:21.63]While you're sitting there eating from, like, a bag of Cheez-Its.
[96:29.55]Oh, yeah, yeah, the monster reactions, that's true.
[96:31.73]You gotta get the accountability and the monster reaction.
[96:34.00]You're right.
[96:34.98]I'll leave it on.
[96:35.48]Alright, so this is the rare monster we couldn't get last time from...
[96:43.88]That one.
[96:44.40]So let's get the facecam on.
[96:45.84]Sure.
[96:49.49]There we go.
[96:51.03]I'm ready to give you a reaction.
[97:07.34]I'm an authorized trainer.
[97:09.90]Who do I have to prove that to?
[97:12.64]I just got ranked a professional trainer.
[97:15.12]Who do I have to talk to for this?
[97:17.05]Okay, well.
[97:23.85]Put it back where it was, I guess.
[97:30.88]What the fuck?
[97:33.68]That's really stupid.
[97:37.34]Put it back in, I guess.
[97:38.48]Whatever.
[97:42.40]Uh, the next one that's gonna go in... is... I found this, uh, while I was scrounging around looking for CDs.
[97:49.54]This is, uh, Halloween Sound Effects.
[97:52.20]Twisted Edition.
[97:52.84]This is a disk full of those... campy, shitty horror movie sounds.
[97:58.71]Remember on Halloween, back in like, uh... I think like... late September of last year, I think I played this.
[98:05.35]For no reason.
[98:06.25]So... Let's see what we get from the spooky Halloween, uh...
[98:10.85]thing that old ladies put into a boombox and then put the speakers out their windows on Halloween night.
[98:17.43]We'll see how it goes.
[98:18.11]I need to upgrade my stable.
[98:31.91]You came back and genuinely thought I was naked.
[98:37.95]That would be bad.
[98:38.59]I would get kicked off of the website.
[98:41.01]Wouldn't I?
[98:45.11]Don't be a rare monster.
[98:46.77]That's another thing I don't like about Monster Rancher 2.
[98:50.34]Like, isn't the whole point that you're supposed to be able to put CDs in and pull out monsters?
[98:56.64]It almost seems like half the time we can't do that.
[99:01.48]Alright, let's see what we get from the spooky city.
[99:06.16]Reaction time.
[99:16.21]I'm gonna predict it's gonna be a wall.
[99:23.19]Well, it's the same.
[99:24.15]It's just the girl again.
[99:26.39]But this time it's spooky, right?
[99:34.70]Cute.
[99:35.30]Yes, it's very cute.
[99:37.86]Do you want to take this to your ranch?
[99:42.14]No.
[99:45.88]boring let's get something not like just like a person let's do uh uh this is rock paintings cdg sampler SEGA of America presents rock paintings I believe this is like this is like a cd this is a SEGA cd music collection thing let's see what we get
[100:19.30]I'm gonna make a one The streams giving you deja vu.
[100:22.52]Well, we we literally did this yesterday so if you were here yesterday, then you definitely have deja vu because It did did did happen the same kind of scenarios played out yesterday Okay Put that away so anybody that's familiar with Monster Rancher 2 what is a
[100:46.23]What's the deal with the rare monsters?
[100:48.05]Do I have to be a certain rank?
[100:49.27]How does it work?
[100:51.97]Somebody give me some insight here, because I don't understand.
[100:54.78]Come here.
[101:01.10]Why?
[101:01.42]What the fuck?
[101:07.17]Rank A. You have to be rank A to do this.
[101:11.19]We're close.
[101:17.94]I almost don't want to do this until we get to rank A. Let's try Wirehead, right?
[101:24.02]Wirehead at least is here.
[101:25.44]See if we can get something from Wirehead.
[101:27.48]One of the greatest games of all time.
[101:30.72]If not the best FMV game at least ever made.
[101:33.53]Is for certain.
[101:40.13]Time to thaw him out.
[101:42.07]We're at B right now, right?
[101:51.55]What a collection.
[101:54.91]It'd be nice if I wasn't opening it the wrong way.
[101:58.71]Toddler brain.
[101:59.79]I almost just dropped it.
[102:00.51]I almost just dropped literal history.
[102:06.06]They wouldn't be able to put it in the museum after that.
[102:18.30]Yuck.
[102:21.25]Rating.
[102:24.13]Alright, whatever this is, we're going to go.
[102:25.75]Because I got a feeling we're going to get at least another three or four messages popping up on the screen about how we can't do it.
[102:40.87]No, good.
[102:41.96]Thank you.
[102:43.36]Thank you.
[102:44.12]Appreciate it.
[102:46.08]What is it?
[102:50.39]Are these like amiibos on disk?
[102:51.85]Uh, kind of.
[102:53.73]That's actually a pretty good way to describe it.
[102:55.29]Something cool.
[102:58.79]Alright, it's just... I think this is just a... This is a lady version of the human centipede.
[103:13.16]I believe I've never seen this before.
[103:15.54]Neither have I. Well, anyway, it's obvious that this is a new monster.
[103:18.92]I'll register this with the MIA.
[103:20.94]Yes, please do.
[103:32.96]I need to see what the moves are, because those stats are so awful that there's no way that this doesn't have an interesting move, right?
[103:54.46]Just call it glug.
[103:58.30]I'm with you on that.
[103:58.98]I'm not gonna use it.
[104:00.36]I just wanna know.
[104:01.52]Let's see.
[104:14.47]Likes Cup of Jelly.
[104:15.45]Doesn't like to battle.
[104:16.63]Bad-natured.
[104:19.92]And... This thing is terrible.
[104:23.48]Put it on ice.
[104:29.20]Get frozen.
[104:35.89]Where did that come from?
[104:36.45]That came from Wirehead, right?
[104:37.91]Well, that was a bust.
[104:40.49]Alright, one more time.
[104:41.93]Last one.
[104:42.53]This one we're gonna put in Night Trap.
[104:44.39]This is the original Night Trap for SEGA CD.
[104:50.07]And then we're gonna farm out and we're gonna go get A rank and come back and play the breeding game we want to play.
[105:00.18]Last attempt here with Night Trap.
[105:03.84]Okay.
[105:23.66]Are we going to get a controversial monster?
[105:25.36]We might.
[105:25.73]They did a whole senate hearing on this game.
[105:29.41]I hope we get a senator out of this.
[105:38.33]Put this away.
[105:39.08]Because this is not necessarily rare, but it was expensive.
[105:47.12]This was not... Oh!
[105:53.69]That noise was total misery.
[105:58.69]Oh, I still feel it.
[105:59.63]I'm so sorry if you guys have, though.
[106:03.25]That, like, eee!
[106:10.13]Here's a big moment.
[106:10.86]Alright, here comes your reaction.
[106:12.60]Here it comes.
[106:13.00]I'm ready.
[106:23.33]Something worth keeping.
[106:25.15]Would be nice.
[106:31.50]A lizard eye.
[106:34.52]Into the dumpster.
[106:39.04]Into the dumpster.
[106:42.32]Maybe not yet.
[106:44.52]165 intelligence.
[106:52.13]to the glue factory.
[106:53.55]We're gonna keep this one because the intelligence is high.
[106:59.57]We call it Senator?
[107:03.51]Night trap camera?
[107:04.84]Yeah, it is.
[107:05.64]We'll call this guy like Camera 16 or something.
[107:09.14]Yeah, like Cam 8.
[107:09.50]There.
[107:23.83]Put him on ice.
[107:32.51]Freeze, please.
[107:33.79]Alright, let me just look.
[107:47.28]Fine, listen, I wanna see what we can make.
[107:48.94]I'm just curious.
[107:50.95]I'm gonna save the game and we'll just... we'll reload the game.
[107:53.63]I'm just curious what you can make with what we have currently.
[108:06.48]Save the game.
[108:07.78]Go to the lab.
[108:12.10]Combine.
[108:15.54]500 gold.
[108:15.82]First choose the monster you want to use the main breed.
[108:17.88]Okay.
[108:19.96]so we've got I suck I don't know who this is but let's just say we did beanbag Sonic with um let's see the rind beanbag Sonic and rind you want to use an item as a secret seasoning no
[108:47.97]This combination doesn't look so good.
[108:49.41]I can't recommend it.
[108:51.87]So there's a... Okay, we got Terror Dog.
[108:56.40]Hound, Saurian, Tiger.
[108:59.92]Terror Dog.
[109:01.20]No.
[109:06.09]Those all seem pretty terrible.
[109:09.03]Oh no, we could get a Frozen Gaboo or a Gaboo.
[109:15.81]How about the Rind and... I suck.
[109:22.95]No special seasoning.
[109:26.79]No, this one sucks.
[109:32.17]How about Glug... and... Beanbag Sonic.
[109:39.56]With some extra seasoning.
[109:42.90]With like some steroids sprinkled in.
[109:49.52]Can't use this.
[109:51.86]This prospect is fine, it will probably work out.
[109:53.96]Alright, hold on a minute here.
[109:58.09]We could get Mint Pixie, Dayton Tiger Color Pandora, Peach Tree Bug, or a Gaboo.
[110:09.31]What is Mint?
[110:16.51]Abort, abort, stop, don't do it.
[110:20.19]I'm not gonna do it, I just wanted to see what it was.
[110:21.73]I wonder if, what about the rind and glug?
[110:30.43]Just out of curiosity, no seasoning.
[110:35.41]What kind of weird wall can we get?
[110:40.98]This combination doesn't look so good.
[110:45.83]Uh, we can get Fairy Sauron.
[110:48.27]Romper wall, Jura wall.
[110:50.32]No, these are all terrible.
[110:57.56]Cam 8 and Glug with seasoning.
[111:00.48]Okay, Cam 8.
[111:07.83]And Glug.
[111:11.23]With some seasoning.
[111:12.25]With some mangoes.
[111:17.71]Can't use this.
[111:19.23]This one's all up to you.
[111:23.15]Oh, we got Melon Suezo Pink Eye.
[111:25.71]Okay, we have a chance to get Pink Eye, which I feel like it's... These two suck anyways.
[111:34.02]Cam 8 and Glug, who gives a... No, who... Let's try it.
[111:39.94]We're gonna save Scummon anyways.
[111:41.20]Let's just do it.
[111:41.60]Let's see what happens.
[111:50.37]Spit out that DNA.
[111:53.71]We got pink eye.
[111:54.35]Okay.
[111:57.07]Good.
[111:59.03]That's pretty good base intelligence.
[112:04.62]It's trouble-free birth.
[112:09.62]You have to give it a name.
[112:14.44]Should I keep it?
[112:25.81]Senator?
[112:26.27]Wait, did he not watch Rick and Morty?
[112:40.66]Yeah, I like conjunctivitis.
[112:42.00]How about just conjuncto?
[112:44.31]Conjuncto.
[112:45.15]I like it.
[112:56.43]Conjuncto.
[113:02.69]Conjuncto girl.
[113:07.39]Conjuncto.
[113:09.02]Conjuncto Joe.
[113:10.64]It's a girl though, isn't it?
[113:15.42]How about like Connie Conjuncto?
[113:19.84]What's a three-letter word for... What's a three-letter girl name?
[113:24.64]That's with a C.
[113:30.20]Conjuncto Joe Yeah, I mean that that is yeah Amy Conjuncto, alright, I like that That's sticking with me for some reason I like Amy Conjuncto I don't know why
[114:02.28]It's such a shit name, but I like it.
[114:07.57]It's another Sonic character.
[114:22.16]Now we just need a Knuckles.
[114:23.84]We need a Tails.
[114:24.66]We gotta do the whole family.
[114:27.00]There's Amy.
[114:30.73]That was worth $500 for keeping it.
[114:40.14]The stats, her stats really aren't that bad.
[114:44.25]170 base intelligence is pretty good.
[114:49.65]Plus, we can always combine her with, who's the one, there was so many Sonic characters, look, let's just pull up a list.
[114:56.50]of Sonic characters.
[114:57.44]There was like a big bunny rabbit.
[114:59.46]There was a weird turtle person.
[115:01.36]There's an alligator.
[115:02.56]They did the whole thing.
[115:03.50]There's as many Spider-Man villains as there are directly connotated Sonic characters.
[115:10.13]Every single Spider-Man villain is a Sonic the Hedgehog character.
[115:21.05]Let's see.
[115:25.86]Who the fuck is Espio?
[115:28.30]Espio the Chameleon.
[115:29.94]Okay.
[115:31.44]Cream the Rabbit.
[115:32.59]Who the fuck are you?
[115:35.15]Charmy Bee?
[115:38.19]Look, Chaos is one of those, uh... Globulo Monster Rancher enemies.
[115:43.21]Vector the Crocodile.
[115:44.25]Look, he's in this game.
[115:52.52]Big the Cat.
[115:53.48]Blaze the Cat.
[115:54.32]Too many cats.
[116:02.38]Yeah, we're going to make all the Sonic characters.
[116:04.52]Let's go.
[116:04.82]Put her on ice.
[116:06.77]Should we play with her for a little while?
[116:14.59]What do you think?
[116:17.85]Don't shit talk big to cats.
[116:19.85]I'm not going to shit talk big to cats.
[116:26.62]Alright, let's pull them out.
[116:27.66]Let's
[116:30.01]Let's just do with everybody's fanfiction real quick.
[116:32.83]Well, let me save it first.
[116:36.21]We're gonna combine Amy and Sonic and see what happens.
[116:42.06]Alright, lab.
[116:59.14]I just want to see.
[116:59.94]I'm not going to do it.
[117:05.48]Beanbag Sonic and Amy Conjuncto.
[117:09.95]I'm just curious what we could get.
[117:13.17]No seasoning.
[117:13.81]Let's just... I'm curious.
[117:14.69]This combination doesn't look so good.
[117:22.75]Well, there's a chance to get mono-eyed, which means you have one eye.
[117:30.12]Is that Tails?
[117:30.88]Is this how Tails was born?
[117:32.21]Hold on, was Tails... Tails is not... I need to do this just to see.
[117:49.98]Give us Tails.
[117:54.04]There he is.
[118:05.67]No, no, no, we save scum, don't worry.
[118:08.41]File, load data.
[118:10.63]Memory card 1.
[118:11.29]There it is.
[118:36.22]It's like it never happened.
[118:37.00]What do you mean, do not load?
[118:43.18]I'm not going to play with that shitty eyeball.
[118:46.92]That's the default eyeball.
[118:48.68]I'm not going to use that thing.
[118:49.84]We're going to bring back Sonic.
[118:51.24]And we're going to get to level A and then... Combine Shadow and Tails.
[119:01.49]Why would you think I would ever betray our beloved beanbag Sonic?
[119:10.82]We can't get any interesting monsters yet, because we need to be higher ranked.
[119:18.10]I should just get all Sonic games.
[119:23.72]See, everything's fine.
[119:27.30]We can't do what we wanted to do, so let's just win more tournaments, and then be able to actually make rare monsters.
[119:38.10]This music makes me want to get a lobotomy.
[119:41.09]Well, I'm sorry.
[119:43.23]I'll turn it off for you.
[119:45.83]See?
[119:48.47]See, it's off.
[119:49.79]Everything's fine.
[119:55.04]61 loyalty.
[119:56.62]We've got a B tournament coming up here.
[119:59.04]This is just a round robin.
[120:01.04]A serious cup.
[120:02.16]And then a free-for-all.
[120:08.17]When's the next actual tournament?
[120:10.95]Here.
[120:11.17]Okay.
[120:12.76]Alright, how we doing?
[120:16.94]Training.
[120:17.88]We need to do skill.
[120:20.20]I'm willing to pay for it.
[120:22.10]Skill.
[120:25.77]Your monster is higher than B rank.
[120:28.37]Then you can use any location you want.
[120:29.99]Go ahead, choose the location.
[120:31.17]Okay, so we have to unlock... Tech.
[120:35.63]Wait a minute, hold on a second.
[120:38.40]Okay, so we're looking at defense.
[120:40.78]Okay, we got some new ones here.
[120:46.35]Special tech.
[120:50.05]Hit tech.
[120:57.59]Withering heavy tech is power.
[121:00.45]Sharp tech.
[121:03.17]We can't just do speed.
[121:05.78]All speed.
[121:06.58]We need skill.
[121:08.50]It doesn't matter how fast you are, if you miss every swing, you're never gonna win a tournament.
[121:43.90]You're not fast enough.
[121:51.10]New tech.
[121:54.20]So, we got 300 speed now, we got a new tech.
[121:58.30]This is the last time I'm gonna do speed here.
[122:08.72]Getting more life too, that's good.
[122:13.64]We lost this last time on the first try.
[122:15.24]Let's see if we can get it on the first try this time.
[122:18.54]Last one.
[122:19.30]Come on.
[122:20.66]Get up there.
[122:21.62]Ah, yes.
[122:22.04]Okay.
[122:22.52]I've never seen the... All of us... I've never seen... We've never seen it.
[122:28.06]Here's the next one.
[122:30.04]Two polar bears.
[122:33.20]What do we have to do?
[122:33.82]Just run by them?
[122:50.32]Oh my god, this is... I love it.
[122:53.52]No, he got hit!
[122:58.06]Is that okay?
[123:00.05]No, he's still up.
[123:10.17]Why does he have to do the dab every time?
[123:13.58]Every single time.
[123:15.14]When you could be doing anything else.
[123:18.10]Victory.
[123:21.54]I ran into a wall!
[123:23.94]Okay, we got the random encounter up here.
[123:25.40]Let's see what it is.
[123:35.04]Why does he have to do it?
[123:36.24]He does it every ten seconds.
[123:39.10]He can't help himself.
[123:46.06]Oh, shit.
[123:48.02]What happens if you lose?
[123:50.68]It is terrible defense, but... Alright, come on beanbag.
[123:56.02]Make it happen.
[124:02.50]It's Tails.
[124:03.04]I don't remember Tails being able to do that.
[124:11.31]Get up there!
[124:11.79]Do something!
[124:14.75]Get up there!
[124:18.21]Will you please do any move?
[124:20.53]Like, it took you long enough.
[124:22.11]You've got to hit him.
[124:22.77]You've got to just kill him.
[124:24.31]Oh my god.
[124:24.97]You've got to stop with the AI.
[124:29.78]It was smarter.
[124:30.44]I mean, the AI decided to do one move this whole fight.
[124:36.74]Finally.
[124:37.14]Just do that a few times.
[124:38.68]He probably has so many guts right now.
[124:40.16]Why would you not use the... Great.
[124:46.85]Well...
[124:53.77]I would be booing right now, too.
[124:54.79]This is kind of pathetic.
[125:02.98]He's tired.
[125:06.34]Watch him come back all the way from this.
[125:07.54]It'd be amazing.
[125:10.54]Now he's dead.
[125:21.26]Somebody took the hand out of his ass.
[125:22.68]The puppet face.
[125:23.46]Did you see that?
[125:24.04]That was like a guy doing a puppet sock.
[125:42.77]Is he alright?
[125:47.15]Are we gonna get a dab?
[125:48.36]That's how you know he's okay.
[125:51.84]Ooh, it ran away.
[125:53.42]Are you okay?
[125:55.58]Come on, let us know if you're alright!
[126:02.37]He's not okay.
[126:08.77]He's alright!
[126:22.79]Seems pretty tired.
[126:23.53]Give it some rest.
[126:24.09]So we got more speed.
[126:25.13]Let's see what we got, though.
[126:29.81]335.
[126:32.75]What is this?
[126:33.89]Jumping Chop.
[126:36.40]It's a lot more damage.
[126:39.02]This thing is awesome.
[126:42.56]It's a terrible hit percentage.
[126:43.84]It's a move you can do from very far away.
[126:45.30]Look at that crit, though.
[126:56.10]What's the, uh... What's going on next to Power Type over there on the right?
[127:01.74]What's with the two eyes that are being, you know, happy?
[127:05.35]Does that mean that's his favorite move?
[127:13.01]I feel like this could be a game changer here.
[127:15.75]Hail Mary.
[127:20.01]I guess he likes that move.
[127:23.13]Let him rest.
[127:26.56]Now we need skill.
[127:27.92]That's all we're going to focus on.
[127:29.52]Only.
[127:30.68]Until it's at least over 200.
[127:31.82]Get some money.
[127:36.54]Where's the next tournament?
[127:40.18]We got this tournament.
[127:43.72]I don't know.
[127:44.12]He's not ready for this.
[127:45.34]I'm not going to put him in that official tournament.
[127:50.47]Let's get that skill up.
[128:00.95]Beautiful.
[128:05.13]It's because he's good-natured.
[128:07.51]Okay.
[128:08.99]I can see that.
[128:10.29]Let's get skill to 200.
[128:14.58]Seems tired.
[128:15.54]Save it and then... Back to work!
[128:25.88]That stupid dab.
[128:28.51]Ugh.
[128:31.82]Take a sleep.
[128:37.07]Chat has saved a hundred seagulls?
[128:39.19]What do you mean he saved a hundred seagulls?
[128:41.99]Did somebody just do that again?
[128:43.29]Oh, it's because that is an old command.
[128:46.80]No, no, no, wait.
[128:51.08]I want the tops of the... Let's give him a jelly cup.
[128:59.31]Yeah, people are saying to save the game, but they're doing an old command.
[129:02.31]Official tournament, end of the month.
[129:12.51]Mm-hmm.
[129:14.64]Oh, shit.
[129:20.04]This is gonna be half off, right?
[129:23.92]God damn it.
[129:26.96]How much money do I have?
[129:27.66]600?
[129:29.04]Okay.
[129:29.48]Am I playing this on an emulator?
[129:37.67]No, I am not.
[129:38.49]I'm playing this on an original PlayStation 1.
[129:44.33]What about... Can I sell some stuff?
[129:50.13]Is there a tournament or is there a... I could... I don't care about fame.
[129:56.19]What can we do here?
[130:00.49]500 go- Okay.
[130:01.61]Well, just figured it out.
[130:03.23]I'm just gonna sell this and go train.
[130:08.17]Right?
[130:10.95]500 bucks.
[130:11.85]Go train.
[130:12.63]Skill.
[130:17.12]Sell the drugs.
[130:17.66]We don't need them.
[130:18.06]I'm gonna sell steroids to an old lady.
[130:22.60]Let's do it.
[130:27.62]Okay.
[130:34.07]Let's see what we got for battles coming up here.
[130:39.41]There's a shitty D battle as well.
[130:46.06]I'm gonna... I'm gonna lose so many fans.
[130:49.42]But let's just go... Let's just go diarrhea on these fucking newbies.
[130:53.97]You know what I mean?
[130:54.45]And just make two grand.
[131:03.10]Your monster's fame's gonna drop.
[131:06.05]Who cares?
[131:06.47]You're gonna unfollow me?
[131:12.57]Because of what?
[131:13.53]Because I'm smurfing right now?
[131:16.05]Okay, so if somebody came up to you and they said, hey, you're very good at League of Legends.
[131:20.13]Will you make a smurf account for $2,000?
[131:23.94]You can't sign that paper fast enough.
[131:26.38]Some of you guys that play League.
[131:27.28]Are you serious?
[131:39.26]Coming back down.
[131:39.98]Like, these guys couldn't even get out of the fucking instructional leagues.
[131:48.33]Oh, you're whipped out.
[131:50.51]Made me try to get out of double-A baseball.
[131:55.89]Hey, please give me $2,000 for free.
[132:02.56]Ooh, good job.
[132:03.40]Nice work.
[132:08.79]Oh, you didn't back out.
[132:10.83]You won a fight.
[132:13.49]I'm going to make that the biggest mistake of your entire life.
[132:21.64]Bye-bye, as they say.
[132:22.66]You know, like, bye-bye.
[132:26.70]I'm going to crush you.
[132:27.86]123 health, 165 power, not even any intelligence.
[132:30.47]Look at that speed.
[132:31.01]Yawn.
[132:36.00]You know what I'm saying?
[132:37.50]Check this out.
[132:38.22]Instant kill right here.
[132:44.60]Almost.
[132:45.66]Almost.
[132:47.61]What were you thinking?
[132:48.75]Huh?
[132:49.59]What was going through your mind there?
[132:58.65]Don't ever think that you're going to be a hero here.
[133:10.19]I want one of those stupid fucking dogs so bad.
[133:13.48]How do you make one of those?
[133:18.94]He wants to fight too.
[133:19.62]He's won two in a row.
[133:24.11]I'll take the magic banana.
[133:25.21]I'm gonna sell it immediately.
[133:32.75]Yeah, this is gonna be an instant kill.
[133:34.61]You ready for this?
[133:36.84]One hit KO.
[133:38.58]Immediately.
[133:39.30]Three, two, one.
[133:41.80]Dead.
[133:45.18]Oh.
[133:49.08]Fuck.
[133:50.44]Oh, well.
[133:53.10]I'm getting booed.
[133:56.13]It's alright.
[134:04.85]Now we can train twice.
[134:07.21]So, that's good.
[134:15.62]You can just farm this for money.
[134:21.30]Just do a bunch of these.
[134:22.43]Even if you lose fans.
[134:23.31]Does it really matter?
[134:35.15]He actually is... He actually is... dabbing... Nah, I can't say it, but you know what I mean?
[134:43.25]He really is doing that.
[134:45.69]Because everybody hates him now.
[134:48.33]And he's just making a bunch of money.
[134:49.57]And he's losing fans.
[135:04.18]Hey, you can't lose fans if you don't have fans.
[135:11.32]Oh, man.
[135:18.53]God.
[135:19.69]And he also learned a lesson.
[135:22.49]Yeah.
[135:23.29]It's called being very unsportsmanlike.
[135:32.88]Congratulations on your victory.
[135:34.70]You did a great job.
[135:35.40]We're not gonna praise him, though.
[135:36.40]Like, you want me to praise you?
[135:39.58]You beat up a bunch of, like, children.
[135:41.32]Yeah, oh, like, praise you.
[135:46.40]You went back to like the fourth grade and took the fourth grade math test as a high schooler.
[135:50.72]You want to get praised for that?
[135:51.86]What are you, Billy Madison?
[135:52.98]Give me a break.
[135:59.96]Because you told him to.
[136:09.37]No, but hey, I...
[136:12.74]I just made the suggestion to him that he could make a lot of money
[136:18.45]If he smurfed on some kids, you know what I mean?
[136:20.83]If he like, if he went into League of Legends and went to like the the room, the first like zero to five rankings, right?
[136:30.33]Because it's like you get to level 30, you get to level 20 and you can go actually play in the big leagues.
[136:34.39]I just merely suggested you can make a lot of money if you go to the lower brackets in League and just beat the kids that are playing League right now.
[136:48.65]I didn't say, I didn't say, you have to do that.
[136:50.43]I said, you know, you can make some money doing that.
[136:53.09]I'm not a financial advisor.
[136:54.15]I don't even claim to be.
[137:02.43]Just go beat all the younglings in League.
[137:11.87]We're talking about League of Legends here, guys.
[137:19.92]What have we got for stats?
[137:21.38]11 fame, holy shit.
[137:35.91]Wasn't it like 30?
[137:36.41]League of Legends is a shitty game.
[137:45.24]This is not.
[137:50.70]Don't, like, 50 billion people play League?
[137:54.02]Wouldn't be that hard to find easy games to win.
[137:56.52]For money.
[137:59.68]Alright.
[138:01.26]Let's let him rest.
[138:02.02]And we're gonna... No, wait, wait!
[138:06.30]What week is it?
[138:08.24]Next game.
[138:10.66]What the fuck are you talking about?
[138:11.96]Next game.
[138:16.10]No, that ain't happening.
[138:17.41]Next game.
[138:19.22]What on Earth are you talking about?
[138:20.70]Nope.
[138:22.96]We're staying here.
[138:23.68]This is the game we're playing.
[138:43.60]Have you seen the notice?
[138:44.30]We're doing a thousand gold for skill.
[138:47.82]Skill.
[138:48.62]Skill in life.
[138:50.74]Let's do it.
[138:51.20]Wait, let me save it first.
[138:56.20]I'm scared.
[138:57.35]No, not item.
[139:07.77]File.
[139:08.55]File.
[139:13.31]No, we're not doing speed, we're doing skill.
[139:16.48]This is the only st- I am now a Monster Rancher streamer.
[139:21.14]You know how some people play League?
[139:25.98]And they go down to the instructional leagues and they beat all the newbies?
[139:33.28]I'm a Monster Rancher guy.
[139:35.59]Same content, different game.
[139:37.11]You're watching me do the same thing.
[139:42.15]Alright, let's do it.
[139:44.15]Let's go.
[139:49.68]God damn it.
[139:56.04]Hit tech!
[139:57.58]There's a chance for a new technique.
[139:59.66]And we're going to go after some D level.
[140:02.34]Oh, that is pretty cool looking.
[140:04.42]That's really cool.
[140:08.85]I want to see this guy.
[140:11.87]You're going to miss the official tournament?
[140:12.99]That's fine.
[140:13.29]We're going to do this twice.
[140:22.08]Monster Rancher Invitational.
[140:25.92]I would put Beanbag Sonic in that.
[140:27.38]Don't you guys think?
[140:34.77]New tech.
[140:35.23]Let's see it.
[140:43.48]New tech, there it is.
[140:46.92]It was worth doing already.
[141:03.91]Got it.
[141:07.19]Can you use music CDs for the game?
[141:08.65]Yes, you can.
[141:12.52]You can use any CD that has any data on it.
[141:15.46]As long as it is a CD.
[141:17.79]You can't use DVDs or Blu-rays.
[141:20.63]But you can use DVDs in Monster Rancher 3, but that's because it's on PlayStation 2.
[141:34.75]Nailed it.
[141:35.33]Come on.
[141:38.49]There we go, 9 skill.
[141:39.88]Finally.
[141:40.80]We needed over 200 skill.
[141:44.66]Here comes that crab meme.
[141:47.82]Old material.
[141:48.56]I don't need to say it.
[141:53.40]Yeah, you can burn it.
[141:53.96]We did that last time.
[141:55.02]When we played the first game, we burnt a CD of me screaming.
[142:00.26]Any data.
[142:00.90]It just has to have data on the CD.
[142:10.97]This is just a snooze for our buddy Sonic, you know what I mean?
[142:16.02]Use that CD again?
[142:17.42]I'm not gonna lie to you guys, I have no idea what the fuck that is.
[142:21.76]Not in a single clue.
[142:29.69]Dude, there are so many CDs scattered in so many directions in this room that it would take me probably an hour to find that.
[142:38.96]What about a blank CD?
[142:41.62]Um, I think it has to have some kind of data on it.
[142:48.58]Burn another disk?
[142:49.30]No, me burning the disk is apparently what killed the memory stick in my computer.
[142:53.32]Because it blue screens right after that, and then the computer was never the same.
[142:58.07]I'm terrified to burn another CD.
[143:00.45]I'm gonna burn another stick of RAM.
[143:01.71]There's a wild monster.
[143:06.63]Should be a piece of cake.
[143:08.09]Let's see if we can do the new skill.
[143:15.75]Oops.
[143:19.47]That's a general default amiibo.
[143:21.55]It's not gonna do anything.
[143:22.49]That's what I'm talking about.
[143:26.53]Now it's, yeah, it got imbued with fire, I think.
[143:28.75]Do you see that?
[143:34.43]Let's go download it.
[143:37.99]I appreciate that I can watch your streams in 160p and it still looks the same.
[143:49.06]Yeah, this is that guy from Sonic!
[143:50.40]What was that guy's name?
[143:52.82]What's his name?
[143:53.34]I have my trusty list of Sonic characters here.
[144:02.35]Who is it?
[144:02.75]What's his name there?
[144:04.69]This is stupid Amiibo, right?
[144:07.89]That was Chaos.
[144:11.25]We just killed Chaos.
[144:13.75]I'm happy with that.
[144:21.36]I'm telling you.
[144:24.12]Look it up.
[144:28.40]GG, Sonic.
[144:29.70]Nice work.
[144:31.52]Streamer is ignoring chat.
[144:32.74]What are you talking about?
[144:33.36]I'm staring at it right now.
[144:39.11]And got a new move.
[144:40.49]Which I can't wait to decipher.
[144:46.65]Great job being back, Sonic.
[144:49.07]It's an easy battle to win against those guys.
[144:55.12]It's actually watchable at 160p.
[144:56.58]Yeah, I'm trying to save you guys some bandwidth.
[144:59.80]By playing... 20 year old video games.
[145:03.04]Upscaled into 1080p, 720p, whatever.
[145:07.94]Oh yes, the prize money.
[145:11.24]We just won it all back.
[145:14.06]We just got to do all that for free.
[145:21.05]No praising.
[145:21.93]We praise too much.
[145:28.61]Let's give it some rest.
[145:29.31]I wanna see what the technique is, though.
[145:40.49]Okay, what is this?
[145:42.81]Rolling Chop?
[145:46.17]Back Blow Shockwave Rolling Chop.
[145:52.96]Another Sonic move.
[145:54.30]He's gonna roll.
[145:55.20]Alright, so this is...
[146:00.46]It's okay.
[146:02.38]It is more damage than everything in this list here.
[146:09.81]It's gonna get hard to scroll through these, though.
[146:14.07]It's like I talked about before, it's weird, because... I'm going to show you guys what I have to do to change moves.
[146:20.73]So here it is, ready?
[146:21.53]I'd have to do R1, square, to get to here.
[146:27.12]It's R1, L1, L1, you know, square, square, square, square, square, R1, square.
[146:35.32]It's weird.
[146:39.56]Once I start to get more than 7, 8, 9 moves, it's going to be actually difficult to do that.
[146:46.32]Because I have to move back and forth, too, with the D-pad.
[146:48.43]It's kind of like patting your head and rubbing your stomach.
[146:51.37]It's all good, though.
[146:56.61]Have a well-deserved rest.
[146:57.65]Wait, what are you saying?
[147:08.56]When did I say the B word?
[147:13.08]Can you delete moves?
[147:14.06]I don't think so.
[147:15.67]This is an old game.
[147:19.95]What did I say?
[147:20.45]Somebody clip it.
[147:22.69]The AI can do it?
[147:24.21]It's probably, realistically, it's probably going to be a better idea if I let the AI play the game later on here.
[147:31.28]Because cycling through moves, the AI can do it in like a quarter of a second where I have to like go L1 square square L1 X.
[147:40.03]It's just that computers are faster than me.
[147:42.43]I'm willing to accept that.
[147:47.28]So, maybe.
[147:53.40]You saw how it like cycles, like ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, you know?
[147:57.74]It's doing all kinds of math problems in the background.
[148:03.09]It's easy to scroll through moves, you're just bad.
[148:06.17]I mean, it's not though.
[148:09.61]Needing to press square and R when it's like cycling through a list of five moves to get to the one move you want to do.
[148:15.96]When the computer can do that in like a tenth of a second.
[148:20.80]It would take me probably like a full second to hit like square, square, square, like X. And you have to be in the right spot too.
[148:33.73]I'm not going to do it.
[148:34.37]I'm just saying it makes sense.
[148:40.71]Will streamers eventually be getting replaced by AI?
[148:42.99]That's a good question.
[148:45.35]Probably.
[148:45.73]They already are.
[148:51.02]Mad cuz dab.
[148:52.12]Alright, let's go.
[148:55.84]What do we got for... We got the Spring Carnival.
[149:00.24]No, I'm gonna train him again.
[149:01.58]There's an opportunity to do another train.
[149:06.81]Skill again?
[149:07.37]I think.
[149:16.35]Maybe power.
[149:21.43]What defense?
[149:22.13]I mean, I don't know here.
[149:25.49]This is tough because I really am missing a full tier of moves here.
[149:40.90]Heavy tech, withering, special tech.
[149:43.44]I should do this.
[149:46.52]Just to try to get the move.
[149:49.44]I'm gonna do defense.
[149:51.46]Yeah, that's what we're doing.
[149:55.38]New techniques, see if we can fill it out.
[149:56.70]I don't want to go against Master Splinter.
[150:02.26]Stretch Armstrong.
[150:04.64]Peeper.
[150:06.10]Goldilocks.
[150:07.42]That's a pretty... No, I don't want a mirror match.
[150:09.36]Classy.
[150:11.10]Knuckles!
[150:11.84]Too bad he's not red.
[150:18.43]That's just peepers.
[150:19.45]I don't care.
[150:19.97]Let's just do it.
[150:20.91]Let's get the defense up.
[150:25.96]This is new content.
[150:26.84]New content!
[150:27.42]You're gonna boil yourself and come out alive, which you did.
[150:42.29]Good work.
[150:46.91]You can always tell when he does it.
[150:48.13]Sometimes you can't tell.
[150:48.89]New tech.
[150:53.27]So it probably was worth doing just to get another... The final move list there.
[150:59.02]Okay.
[151:02.54]I think that's supposed to happen.
[151:10.33]I think I'm made out of Jell-O, so it doesn't matter.
[151:11.91]This isn't going to be bad.
[151:20.13]Minigames are so random.
[151:21.13]Yeah, they are.
[151:21.87]It's just a fun little thing.
[151:26.92]You can skip it too, but I like watching it.
[151:33.38]Hopefully we'll get over 100.
[151:34.08]And then we won't be so pathetic if we get hit one time.
[151:50.84]Where is he?
[151:53.70]Is that a win?
[151:54.88]Is that a victory?
[151:56.58]I don't think so.
[151:59.02]That looks like a failure.
[152:01.82]He's like, I'm alright!
[152:10.51]I'm alright!
[152:10.89]I'll prove it!
[152:11.87]Damn!
[152:13.85]T-Rex!
[152:18.35]They spend a lot of time developing these other monsters that you probably can't even use.
[152:22.26]Maybe you can.
[152:22.90]Why would this be a model in the game?
[152:25.22]You could definitely get a T-Rex.
[152:28.70]That was the Pterodactyl.
[152:31.38]That was not a T-Rex.
[152:36.55]Uh-oh.
[152:47.55]What is going on?
[152:49.19]Did he do it?
[152:49.67]Alright, let's see.
[152:50.97]We're looking for the dab.
[152:52.37]That's how we know that it's a success.
[152:58.25]There you go.
[153:00.01]See?
[153:00.09]It's like as if I'm playing the game.
[153:03.60]Four or five slaps.
[153:04.54]Brute force.
[153:06.14]He's done.
[153:12.18]It's not over.
[153:12.76]There's more to it.
[153:15.81]I ran into something.
[153:17.35]That looks scary, whatever it is.
[153:21.65]That's not the thing that I picked.
[153:23.05]I don't know what this thing is.
[153:35.81]Come on.
[153:39.37]So, we have... This is fair.
[153:50.43]I wonder, what if he wins?
[153:53.63]Going up against the Punisher, who is a molten alien breed.
[154:03.29]Good luck.
[154:05.95]Number of the Beast.
[154:07.79]We're pretty much going against Satan.
[154:08.91]Sonic the Hedgehog versus Satan.
[154:11.28]It's like Hornet Satan.
[154:15.14]Watch him pull this off.
[154:17.72]And we get, like, the DNA.
[154:18.94]Look at this.
[154:21.39]This thing is terrifying.
[154:23.09]Come on, make it happen.
[154:24.44]Even if you win.
[154:25.74]By just... Give it your all.
[154:27.48]You'll get praised.
[154:28.44]And I'll give you a mint leaf.
[154:29.52]And I'll give you a mango.
[154:31.92]What the fuck?
[154:32.72]What?
[154:33.58]Wow.
[154:35.38]Wow.
[154:38.70]That's the new move.
[154:41.56]That was amazing.
[154:43.78]Dodging everything.
[154:44.70]Come on.
[154:45.38]You can do this.
[154:46.18]He is so much better than you.
[154:47.34]But prove it.
[154:48.02]All it takes is perseverance.
[154:56.89]He just poked me in the eyes.
[154:59.01]With his fucking painted toenails.
[155:04.89]He has a leech.
[155:12.91]It's as if we didn't do anything.
[155:17.70]It looks like a guy from Molten Core.
[155:19.08]It looks like Majordomo.
[155:26.01]Yeah, well, you know, you can't win them all.
[155:28.55]Especially when you go up against literal rock Satan.
[155:33.49]So, it's no big deal.
[155:46.48]Jerma Nose Molten Corb?
[155:47.62]God, that was a huge WoW player and raider back in the day.
[155:57.66]I know all those encounters.
[156:04.60]It's alright.
[156:09.84]You were a clicker.
[156:12.26]That doesn't mean I couldn't raid.
[156:15.10]Just because I clicked on abilities.
[156:17.18]One, two, three, four, five, I never clicked on.
[156:21.40]6, 7, 8, 9?
[156:21.86]Yes.
[156:22.28]And I had a bunch of abilities on my... Like on Q and W and on my mouse.
[156:28.07]Right?
[156:28.29]Like mouse 4, mouse 3, mouse 2.
[156:32.27]I clicked on a handful of moves.
[156:34.85]Ones that I used maybe once every two minutes.
[156:47.57]What?
[156:50.78]He's... What the fuck?
[156:54.26]It's a serious injury.
[156:57.28]Well, that's what happens when you fight baby Satan.
[156:59.90]I didn't want to fight him.
[157:00.79]No.
[157:02.27]I'm not the sad music with the rainy dark outside.
[157:07.33]He's still in the hospital.
[157:16.97]He's been in the hospital for a month.
[157:21.38]He's still in the hospital.
[157:22.96]Don't die here.
[157:23.58]This would be so bad.
[157:24.42]I would be so upset about this.
[157:30.24]He's back.
[157:31.42]I'm so glad.
[157:32.26]Oh, his loyalty is at fucking 19.
[157:40.13]Come on, man.
[157:41.03]Really?
[157:42.87]Took so long to get that high.
[157:55.65]Uh-oh.
[157:56.55]That's not good.
[158:05.16]Uh-oh.
[158:07.44]He doesn't like me.
[158:08.84]He's skinny and he hates me.
[158:11.10]Uh... Here, have a tasty fruit.
[158:26.11]see look didn't you like that why don't you have a have a mint leaf relax a little take a rest it wasn't it wasn't my intention to have you fight uh Satan so go to rest
[158:58.37]He didn't visit him in hospital?
[159:03.01]I'm a camera in the sky pointing down at his shed.
[159:06.77]I would have gone to the hospital.
[159:11.57]Look at this.
[159:12.95]Is it from the shop?
[159:13.93]Or is it... Of course it's the shop.
[159:17.42]He's happy.
[159:21.98]He's doing okay.
[159:25.64]That sucks.
[159:26.52]Why?
[159:28.55]I was, first they tell me I'm too soft on him, they tell me I'm spoiling the shit out of him, and all of a sudden now he hates me.
[159:35.66]I gave you everything.
[159:38.32]You were under my roof, I took care of you.
[159:41.44]No, he's just, guys, he's just going through his teenage phase.
[159:43.40]All the teenagers hate their parents.
[159:46.84]Right, like, get out of here, dad!
[159:49.48]And there's like rock music blaring.
[159:51.44]I got, that's okay.
[159:56.74]I know, deep down, he'll get over it.
[159:57.76]This is a phase, he'll get over it.
[159:58.83]He's gonna slam the door when I tell him to do his homework.
[160:06.63]Like, turn that down and do your homework, son!
[160:10.07]You have a math test in two days!
[160:11.67]Shut the fuck up, Dad!
[160:14.37]And like, slam!
[160:16.41]And the house fucking shakes and you're like, God!
[160:20.29]It's fine.
[160:20.81]I'm okay with being in this part of being parenthood.
[160:32.10]Emo Beanbag Sonic.
[160:38.07]Fuck you, old man.
[160:39.39]And then I'm like, what did you say to me?
[160:41.59]And I turn and I'm like, what did you say?
[160:43.28]And I look at him sternly.
[160:45.40]And he walks away.
[160:47.52]And he leaves his math homework book open with the page he needs to study fucking scribbled on hard with a pen so it penetrates the first and second layer of paper.
[160:59.13]So there was this damage to that book.
[161:00.83]And I had to pay for that book.
[161:02.45]Those are not cheap.
[161:05.65]It's like $75 for one of those books.
[161:10.92]Alright, let's go... When's the next actual tournament?
[161:20.09]It's September.
[161:21.50]We got an official cup.
[161:27.98]That gives us enough time for me to have him warm up to us again.
[161:31.24]Let's go do... what do we want here?
[161:36.50]I didn't even look at the move.
[161:40.89]There it is.
[161:41.93]Cyclone.
[161:44.87]So this costs a lot.
[161:50.88]It does a lot of damage.
[161:51.80]It's a very good move.
[161:54.04]But that's almost 40 guts to do that.
[161:56.33]I'm not so sure if I want to... I'm not sure about that one.
[162:02.21]But we're okay with that.
[162:03.29]Let's do... Let's do speed.
[162:09.31]It's a two star.
[162:10.86]I think that means he gets more.
[162:12.62]Yeah, this is now level two, right?
[162:18.26]Is the rock getting bigger?
[162:25.24]Speed to 350.
[162:25.78]It's an intelligence-based move.
[162:29.80]At least I have it, though, just to bridge the gap between power and intelligence.
[162:36.26]Let me see.
[162:42.13]Level 7.
[162:42.67]Level 3 intelligence.
[162:44.67]We've got to get defense to level 4.
[162:50.75]We need more power.
[162:55.79]We'll just speed again.
[163:01.07]This is the only two star we have.
[163:04.11]The dodge test.
[163:07.85]Make him despise you?
[163:09.06]He already does.
[163:09.82]I didn't have to do anything to get him to hate me.
[163:14.90]That was perfect, I think.
[163:17.06]Yeah.
[163:18.74]Nice.
[163:19.00]Alright, we're good with speed for now.
[163:23.34]He did its best, pray- yes.
[163:25.04]Very good job, your father's very proud of you.
[163:28.11]Let's go, let's go get ice cream, son.
[163:39.10]Yeah, have another fucking mango.
[163:56.95]24 loyalty.
[163:58.53]I can't have him fight right now because he won't listen to a word I say.
[164:18.75]We haven't done any of these.
[164:19.87]I just don't like the idea of dropping stats.
[164:22.61]I didn't do it in the last game either.
[164:28.12]Let's just do power.
[164:34.74]I'm no better than the mom that brings their daughters on, like, pageants.
[164:38.62]Or that I have a child star that I'm exploiting.
[164:42.22]How?
[164:42.52]What are you talking about?
[164:50.65]This is Monster Rancher.
[165:04.78]So what about Pokémon?
[165:06.60]All you guys that love Pokémon.
[165:09.67]You guys love that game.
[165:13.03]And in that game, not only do you go steal monsters from their natural habitats, but you keep them in these tiny little balls.
[165:22.78]That's not humane.
[165:23.70]Are you serious?
[165:25.92]They're inside of these little domes.
[165:28.62]And you get to take them out.
[165:29.86]You take them out when you decide that you want them to fight for you.
[165:33.14]Look at this.
[165:33.48]This is free range.
[165:36.95]Cage free.
[165:39.01]He gets to go where he wants and say what he wants right here.
[165:47.18]They like it in there.
[165:49.12]Oh, yeah?
[165:49.52]Come on, they could be... Yes!
[166:00.62]He's an organic, cage-free beanbag.
[166:02.70]That's true.
[166:03.15]Alright.
[166:10.77]So we got... Let me let him... Let him rest.
[166:13.01]And then we'll put him on another training regimen.
[166:17.22]And this time, let's hope we don't run into Satan again.
[166:19.38]He's very well.
[166:26.80]Does he still hate me?
[166:28.12]God damn it.
[166:31.45]Why?
[166:32.43]I didn't do anything.
[166:33.93]That's... Come on.
[166:36.47]What is his favorite food?
[166:37.79]He likes to play.
[166:38.49]No, I'm not putting him in a fight.
[166:50.91]What do we got?
[166:52.69]This week, next week.
[166:59.24]I've seen the notice.
[166:59.96]Yeah, it's a thousand gold.
[167:00.96]Alright.
[167:03.56]This time I'm going to do... Probably going to do skill again.
[167:11.15]Seems that there is some chance to acquire a new technique.
[167:18.83]We need the skill.
[167:20.99]And if they're gonna run into a monster, run into this thing with a caved-in head.
[167:32.93]Nah, we need the scale bad.
[167:34.49]Very bad.
[167:39.79]He's gonna get put in the hospital again.
[167:49.05]If Satan shows up again, I'm going to have to reload the save.
[167:56.09]New tech.
[168:01.54]Rock Satan.
[168:02.44]He'll die.
[168:03.08]I don't want that to happen.
[168:20.22]I like the music for these.
[168:22.28]These are fun.
[168:26.42]I like the sharks.
[168:32.04]Give them the one-two.
[168:33.80]Good work.
[168:42.80]The music's very urgent.
[168:43.82]Well, I mean, it has to be.
[168:46.60]Don't you think you want urgent music to play while you're fighting sharks on a raft?
[168:50.38]I would.
[168:58.12]Enjoy raising Sonic Ball, man.
[168:59.84]Oh, we will.
[169:00.90]Thanks for sticking around.
[169:01.48]Take it easy, dude.
[169:10.67]We have gotten really lucky with him and success rate.
[169:17.13]He barely fails anything anymore.
[169:19.15]Alright, now don't run into something ridiculous.
[169:30.67]Get the new tech.
[169:33.55]Level up a little bit.
[169:34.95]Higher percentage to hit.
[169:37.59]No Satans.
[169:40.14]No plasma monsters.
[169:43.58]Just something fucking easy so that he can rest and like me again.
[169:51.81]Alright, nothing.
[169:52.75]What is that?
[169:56.32]What the hell is that?
[170:01.92]Please.
[170:15.09]What the fuck is this thing?
[170:16.57]Silver face?
[170:18.21]No, get him out!
[170:19.34]How do I pull him out?
[170:21.45]How do I pull him out?
[170:22.89]This is not a fight I'm going to fight.
[170:24.23]How do I make him leave?
[170:31.21]What do I do?
[170:36.81]What do you get out?
[170:45.02]Select to back out?
[170:46.44]How do you do that?
[170:49.08]Select.
[170:57.37]Back out.
[171:00.35]How do you back out?
[171:01.95]I'm pressing select.
[171:02.91]It didn't do anything.
[171:04.01]Give up.
[171:04.49]Goodbye.
[171:11.68]All I need is a can-do attitude.
[171:13.92]Sorry.
[171:16.04]If Zeus descended from the heavens right now.
[171:19.99]He had a lightning bolt in his hand, and he was flying around, and the entire crew was behind him.
[171:24.64]Apollo, Meta Knight, George Clooney, you know, all those guys that are up there.
[171:32.74]They all come down.
[171:34.64]You think I'm going to be able to beat Zeus with perseverance?
[171:38.76]I have, like, shitty nunchucks I bought as a joke, like, eight years ago that are sitting in my closet.
[171:44.48]You want me to fight Zeus with those?
[171:52.57]That's not gonna happen.
[171:56.57]Alright, he's fine.
[172:04.16]He's probably so mad.
[172:07.16]Are you okay?
[172:08.20]No.
[172:09.82]What can we do?
[172:10.30]It looked very strong.
[172:11.40]Yes.
[172:20.15]He's defeated by a wild monster, but it acquired a new technique.
[172:23.45]Seems pretty strong.
[172:24.67]Praise it.
[172:25.03]Yes.
[172:25.29]Now let him sleep.
[172:30.20]Second week of September.
[172:31.00]He's running out of money.
[172:34.12]You better enter him.
[172:35.62]Oh, fuck.
[172:36.12]Okay.
[172:36.42]Give him some rest.
[172:42.22]Release him back to 31 loyalty.
[172:43.44]Does he still hate me?
[172:50.56]Back to normal, we're fine.
[172:55.18]Wait, wait, save it.
[172:56.14]Save.
[173:01.59]It's because I didn't force him to fight an impossible encounter.
[173:12.04]Well, I didn't force him.
[173:12.86]Hold on, I didn't force him to do anything.
[173:14.72]Let me backtrack that statement for a second.
[173:24.64]Using Select also works in a tournament so you don't get KO'd and die.
[173:28.68]That's good.
[173:31.96]Unfortunately, he still has really low... Loyalty is terrible right now.
[173:38.90]What's the new move?
[173:45.32]Long Punch.
[173:52.36]Okay.
[173:52.94]Well, Long Punch seems to be... nearly impossible to miss.
[173:58.24]That could be the saving grace.
[174:03.71]Long Punch... I'm gonna have that one out.
[174:09.03]This is... this is kind of an oh shit thing.
[174:11.57]Because that's way too much... I don't have terrible intelligence, so I don't think I'm gonna use that.
[174:16.46]This is, uh, Sharpness... Force D. We need high hit percentage moves.
[174:22.46]on the front lines here.
[174:25.30]I would say Shockwave is probably the one to have out.
[174:29.12]These ones aren't really... Just three more to get hits are all that matters.
[174:37.32]Damage is one thing, but you can win by attrition.
[174:39.08]You don't have to kill anybody.
[174:40.68]I'm going to say buy a move set that I'm going to keep out on day one.
[174:45.09]Long Punch.
[174:47.17]Can't change that out.
[174:49.95]Shockwave.
[174:51.41]And Diving Press.
[175:00.85]Let's get terrible intelligence.
[175:02.03]Yeah, he does.
[175:03.95]So, let's see.
[175:04.93]We got... Eight entrance, 3,000 gold.
[175:08.81]Official cup.
[175:09.45]I don't have any money.
[175:11.65]I have to take that.
[175:12.87]I have to do it.
[175:15.07]Let's let him rest one more day.
[175:17.71]And we'll enter the BE tournament.
[175:26.05]Very well.
[175:31.20]Still 31.
[175:32.39]That's gonna be the kicker right there.
[175:33.51]It's gonna kill us so bad.
[175:35.69]That 31 loyalty is going to ruin everything.
[175:38.49]But... You know, at some point... I mean, I could... No, let's... I mean, I could... Save.
[175:45.13]Yeah.
[175:58.18]Should I do B or A?
[175:59.20]I could go right to A, but I don't think that's a smart idea.
[176:03.04]I think I'm just gonna do B, see what happens.
[176:11.95]C?
[176:17.62]Let's try B. I think it's possible.
[176:23.22]C is easy money, but we lose fans.
[176:26.64]Like I care about fans, but still... I'm gonna try B. Let's just do it.
[176:37.23]Is my internet dying again?
[176:39.39]Don't you do it, internet!
[176:52.08]You don't care about your fans?
[176:53.26]No, I'm talking about his fans.
[176:55.34]Wait, well, you're... You guys are his fans.
[177:06.73]Let's win.
[177:12.95]Dulles, Balaam, Epsilon, Aspen.
[177:16.99]Okay, Epsilon sounds like a pretty... Alright, let's see.
[177:23.87]Our opponent Aspen has high skill.
[177:25.49]Try to KO before it gets... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[177:32.07]Backtracking again.
[177:32.85]I'm going to try to fight.
[177:37.23]Juggling a lot of moves now.
[177:39.19]But... We'll try it.
[177:41.48]Let's see how it is.
[177:42.22]Oof.
[177:45.62]Maybe wasn't quite ready for B. Oof.
[177:56.33]What's going on?
[177:59.67]Okay, well.
[178:00.81]That was strange.
[178:01.53]Where's my moveset?
[178:05.29]Long punch.
[178:08.09]Holy shit.
[178:08.93]Alright, long punch is great.
[178:16.54]I want to do long punch every time.
[178:22.12]Come on, back it up.
[178:26.25]Back up, back up, back up.
[178:27.17]Come on, back it up!
[178:31.21]Get in there and push!
[178:32.53]Push out!
[178:37.27]Dammit.
[178:40.98]Nah, I just don't think those stats are good enough.
[178:48.40]Don't think we're good enough on stats.
[178:50.80]If I could get one last hit though, maybe.
[178:56.75]No.
[178:57.71]He said try to beat it with percentages.
[178:59.09]Just not gonna do it.
[179:05.19]Yeah, we're not ready for B. Just, the stats were just way out of proportion there.
[179:19.26]It's still probably coming.
[179:20.34]It's still possible to.
[179:21.48]What the hell are these?
[179:23.96]I just, I don't want to drop out because I want to see these things.
[179:28.90]What was that?
[179:29.48]That was like Seaman.
[179:37.76]Didn't do enough lung punches.
[179:39.05]Do you see how weird this game gets?
[179:44.01]I want some of these monsters!
[179:51.25]Let's let the AI take the wheel here.
[179:57.28]See what the AI does.
[180:06.56]Is he a used cigarette?
[180:13.82]What is that thing?
[180:18.06]Oh yeah, watch out!
[180:21.08]Watch out for the fucking rolled up dirty cigarette on the streets of Boston!
[180:26.51]Yeah, it don't matter.
[180:30.63]See, even the AI doesn't even know what the hell's going on.
[180:34.95]Hulk!
[180:40.29]I'm not getting KO'd by Prince Cigarette.
[180:43.37]Sorry.
[180:56.52]Mmm.
[180:59.82]That thing is so cool.
[181:06.22]Beanbag Sonic sucks?
[181:07.50]Wait, hold on.
[181:07.86]Have you turned on him already?
[181:11.64]No, he's just out of his league.
[181:23.07]Some of these things are so terrifying.
[181:24.63]Alright, who is this against?
[181:29.33]Let's let the AI, might as well just let the AI play it out, because we're so beat on stats that I'd rather just watch at this point.
[181:43.16]This is winnable.
[181:45.32]We're in the same category of shitty default monsters, you know?
[181:49.59]This is winnable.
[181:52.73]Go get him, Sonic.
[182:00.62]Sonic.
[182:03.94]Sonic.
[182:06.64]I could be doing better than this, come on.
[182:11.04]What is it doing?
[182:11.64]What are you doing?
[182:12.12]You are as indecisive.
[182:14.18]Thank you.
[182:17.50]I would have done that back-to-back right now.
[182:18.82]Back-to-back.
[182:21.35]I definitely would not have walked into his strongest move as close as I could.
[182:29.83]I'm going to pull him out.
[182:31.45]Pull him out.
[182:32.03]Pull him out.
[182:32.53]Pull him out.
[182:33.70]You got one more chance here to do a move.
[182:38.58]Okay.
[182:39.28]Not yet.
[182:40.85]Do it again!
[182:41.25]Quick!
[182:41.61]Right now!
[182:41.99]Do it again!
[182:43.25]Do it!
[182:44.95]Do it!
[182:45.81]Come on, champ!
[182:48.85]Thank you!
[182:58.25]Why are you letting the AI fight now?
[182:59.76]Just for fun.
[183:04.44]Well, you won a game.
[183:10.79]I want to face the Hermit Crab.
[183:15.95]I can't wait to face Cow Hermit Crab.
[183:18.17]It's gonna be great.
[183:27.59]This Sun Monster seems to be the... The rolled up cigarette seems to be impossible to beat.
[183:36.41]There we go.
[183:36.75]Going up against Epsilon.
[183:40.29]Epsilon has lost every fight, so... I mean... Let me try this one.
[183:45.37]What do we got for stats?
[183:54.56]They're all so good.
[184:00.26]That thing is crazy looking, too.
[184:04.37]How did she lose three times in a row?
[184:07.97]Okay, well, obviously I have to do power moves.
[184:12.03]Defense is still so high.
[184:18.87]We're going right off the bat.
[184:19.59]We're going for a jumping chop.
[184:21.18]No, we're not.
[184:35.97]Nice job.
[184:37.11]Pull it back.
[184:41.39]Nice.
[184:43.03]Stay back.
[184:44.91]Stay back.
[184:48.97]I'm not getting hit by that fucking thing.
[184:54.00]Good.
[184:55.86]Break it up again.
[184:57.06]Break it up.
[184:57.62]Break it up.
[184:59.94]Long punch.
[185:02.74]Ah, why?
[185:03.42]Come on.
[185:04.78]Why?
[185:06.00]You had an opportunity there.
[185:07.38]A big one.
[185:12.26]Pull it back!
[185:12.72]Do it again.
[185:22.29]Ooh, I think we won by percentage.
[185:26.03]Yes we did.
[185:28.42]Good work!
[185:30.92]It's not a total loss, we still might actually make some money.
[185:39.86]Two and two?
[185:41.16]That's better than some of these guys.
[185:43.22]We'll get a piece of the pie.
[185:51.37]That mech had missiles and saw blades and you could not beat.
[185:56.95]A beanbag chair Sonic the Hedgehog.
[186:00.49]Something tells me you probably shouldn't be in this league.
[186:11.35]These, uh, let's see if this... Sun Cigarette Man.
[186:15.95]Yeah, no.
[186:16.45]That guy's just, that guy's 4-0.
[186:19.90]No one's beaten that dude.
[186:20.78]Alright, got the same record as Balaam.
[186:29.26]The opponent has great power.
[186:34.02]Be wary of its sudden attack.
[186:36.04]Okay.
[186:37.70]Well, hopefully I can dodge.
[186:44.54]That's why we did speed.
[186:49.30]What about his defense?
[186:52.52]Oh, Lord.
[186:53.66]Okay, so this is... I really can't get hit, so I need to stay really far away, depending on what his power moves are, because I could just long punch him to death.
[187:05.20]Let's hope he doesn't close the gap.
[187:16.01]Stay back, stay back, stay back, stay back.
[187:18.15]Pull it back, pull it back, pull it back.
[187:24.21]Again.
[187:24.41]73% twice in a row.
[187:28.32]That's what I like to see.
[187:28.98]Alright, stay back here.
[187:32.40]Right in the cyclone.
[187:33.26]No, I need it in the cyclone zone.
[187:35.10]Bounce it!
[187:37.90]Oh!
[187:38.08]That's not what we wanted to do.
[187:44.04]Stay all the way back here.
[187:46.43]Gotta win by percentage now.
[187:51.60]Oh, why did you have to do that?
[187:53.00]He'll never... What the fuck?!
[188:00.72]Holy shit, that was not good.
[188:06.08]I'm dead.
[188:08.71]Pull it back.
[188:10.03]Pull it back!
[188:11.91]Of course.
[188:14.21]Nah, it's not gonna happen.
[188:28.33]You have practically no defense.
[188:29.87]Yeah, but that's why we built up speed so much, because I had such bad defense that... You know... Closer Sonic the Hedgehog, and I caved into chat.
[188:38.09]Everybody want to see the fast Sonic?
[188:39.77]I'm not gonna lose all my fans.
[188:47.65]I'm way out of my league right now, and I've won twice.
[188:56.07]Epsilon won.
[189:00.07]Epsilon one okay Aspen is still doing well as well Alright, let me do the three with the same record duelist is just a brick fucking wall What is he possibly good at he has high defense So I might have to use the cyclone attack more than I want to oh
[189:27.97]Oh, now it's Chat's monster now that he loses.
[189:30.47]Great parenting.
[189:31.77]Oh, come on.
[189:36.42]His speed is so bad, though.
[189:43.42]I just have to hit him a bunch of times.
[189:44.94]He's not gonna dodge anything.
[189:46.78]I just have to... I gotta get in close and just beat the absolute shit out of him.
[189:53.66]We'll go with a long punch to start it off.
[189:58.86]No, just... Okay.
[190:01.42]Get in close.
[190:02.46]Like I said.
[190:04.28]Pound him.
[190:05.60]He's got high defense.
[190:06.46]Just keep it up.
[190:07.30]Do it again.
[190:09.06]Keep the pressure up.
[190:13.84]Again.
[190:17.74]Change this out to the slap.
[190:19.36]And just stay in his face.
[190:20.28]That's alright.
[190:26.43]Nah, he wants to push me out to do that beam.
[190:27.93]Don't let him do it.
[190:31.90]Is guard?
[190:32.52]What the hell does that mean?
[190:39.34]Guard.
[190:39.68]I think we have to do this move.
[190:42.18]Dodge it.
[190:42.87]Oh, shit.
[190:48.73]No, don't.
[190:49.71]No foolery right now.
[190:50.77]Hit him with a long punch.
[190:51.53]Quick.
[190:53.51]Good game.
[190:53.87]That's a win.
[191:07.93]That's not a bad record.
[191:09.41]We'll get third or fourth place.
[191:14.30]I mean, we're probably gonna lose to... This Aspen.
[191:23.34]Because that... They know that it's the same record as, uh... Cigarette Man.
[191:33.17]No!
[191:34.01]Alright, so that's... Now we're talking, right?
[191:37.19]So, Prince Cigarette just got his ass kicked by the big, slow, dumb dog thing that we lost to.
[191:45.46]But that thing actually is very good, because now it's in a position to potentially win the tournament.
[191:58.05]Okay, who's coming up now?
[192:01.55]Four and two.
[192:05.82]We get real lucky and win this one.
[192:07.78]We're still in a position to potentially come in, like, second place.
[192:11.46]Still have a shot?
[192:12.78]Mhm.
[192:15.14]High defense.
[192:17.35]Let's give it a shot.
[192:23.97]New monster type we haven't seen before.
[192:31.65]Alright, okay, so it really is just a crab in a shell.
[192:36.84]Huh, okay.
[192:37.84]How am I going to play this one?
[192:47.01]Chip away?
[192:47.53]Stay close?
[192:48.87]Maybe just get in there and just chip away?
[192:50.73]I have a lot of speed.
[192:53.45]He might not be able to hit me with very many things.
[192:58.57]This guy is winning by just outlasting everybody.
[193:05.38]Just cyclone the fuck out of him.
[193:06.48]My intelligence is really... But his intelligence is higher than mine, so that's not going to do very much.
[193:12.62]Because it's int to int, right?
[193:14.20]Let's see what we can do.
[193:19.79]Let's do it right at the bat.
[193:26.49]You want to punch through somebody's defense?
[193:28.84]Sure thing.
[193:29.20]It's alright.
[193:35.38]I'm not gonna let him get anywhere near me, though.
[193:38.10]Stay the fuck away.
[193:45.28]Yeah, he ain't got nothing.
[193:48.36]Pull it back.
[193:49.15]Get my... Let's try Cyclone.
[193:51.15]Oh no, that was too long.
[193:51.93]Punch, fine.
[193:53.83]Good.
[193:58.57]Stay the fuck away.
[193:59.85]Hold back.
[194:04.05]That's not what I wanted!
[194:06.92]Pull it back.
[194:07.28]Come on.
[194:08.74]Good, good, good, good, good.
[194:09.51]Dodge it.
[194:12.47]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[194:17.11]Get it.
[194:18.61]Oh, come on.
[194:19.49]Get it again.
[194:20.45]No foolery.
[194:20.95]Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[194:23.22]Oh, you dickhead.
[194:24.14]That's 70 fucking three.
[194:26.26]63% and I missed both.
[194:27.14]Come on.
[194:28.46]Oh, we still won.
[194:31.82]Oh, I was about to be so upset about that.
[194:42.69]Two high percentage rolls.
[194:44.28]Just losing both is... So we might win.
[194:50.82]We're gonna be tied with somebody.
[194:55.44]Who else has four wins?
[194:58.85]Almost everybody does.
[194:59.59]What the hell are they gonna do?
[195:01.27]Like a single elimination tournament here?
[195:08.37]No, he's five.
[195:11.11]So he wins.
[195:12.19]He's five and two.
[195:12.85]Oh well.
[195:24.08]Prince, uh, Cigarette Prince wins.
[195:33.56]No.
[195:34.56]It's tied.
[195:37.75]We have monsters whose scores are tied, so we will now hold a tie-breaking match to determine the champion.
[195:43.23]I'm gonna say Prince Cigarette's gonna win.
[195:47.50]Yeah, that was a no contest.
[195:50.38]So will we get tied for third place?
[195:51.74]That was like a four-way tie in third place.
[196:02.65]It's alright.
[196:05.45]We'll make some money.
[196:08.00]Yeah, that's fine.
[196:09.40]1100 bucks.
[196:09.75]That's alright.
[196:10.07]I'm okay with that.
[196:15.63]Got some fans back.
[196:20.87]Who let that guy in the tournament?
[196:22.09]I know.
[196:22.41]Come on.
[196:23.33]That's clearly an A or an S rank monster.
[196:26.41]Get him out of here.
[196:32.77]Yeah, I got some more subscribers.
[196:33.77]That's good.
[196:40.25]Got a lesson, too.
[196:43.54]Good.
[196:43.90]Defense is important here.
[196:48.52]Did a good job.
[196:49.04]Praise him, yes.
[196:52.06]Did better than I expected.
[196:57.29]Well, we have some money.
[196:58.31]Let's just give him... This is the last jelly cup, right?
[197:19.34]Oh, one more left.
[197:23.88]Now we spoiled them.
[197:26.40]Well... That's too bad.
[197:36.27]I think we go into the... Pure silver, though.
[197:41.47]Let's drop down to C. Let's try... No!
[197:45.62]We still did fine.
[197:46.62]No, ah...
[197:51.29]hero badge he's getting too old how old is he he's two years three months let's take let's have him let's let's have him rest and we'll take him into the sea tournament here try to win just two grand train him again
[198:25.63]Three is dead.
[198:27.35]Dead at five.
[198:28.63]I thought it was between three and five.
[198:32.27]Let's go win some money.
[198:44.40]It's very well.
[198:45.95]Gonna lose fans here, but...
[198:54.19]Use him before you lose him.
[198:55.63]Well, I need money for that.
[199:02.81]Wait, he's gonna die?
[199:03.97]They don't live forever?
[199:05.19]No, they don't, unfortunately.
[199:11.94]No, no, I want guaranteed victory here.
[199:20.46]Is this a mayonnaise tournament?
[199:29.64]Gunburn.
[199:31.44]Our old nemesis.
[199:34.10]We have new moves since our last encounter.
[199:42.79]Defense is bad.
[199:43.65]So we're just gonna hammer him with the guaranteed hits.
[199:47.71]His life is terrible.
[199:51.42]Just long punch him.
[199:52.56]He ain't gonna fucking last ten seconds.
[199:59.28]Right off the bat, let's get it again.
[200:07.02]Good.
[200:13.92]Damn it.
[200:16.24]No, I want to get in close.
[200:20.76]Pull back.
[200:23.08]And... Get it.
[200:24.90]No, no foolery.
[200:26.12]Don't get in that zone.
[200:26.94]That's his dead zone.
[200:27.98]That's the zone that you don't want to be in.
[200:31.91]There he is.
[200:33.69]Now let's get in close and hammer him.
[200:37.67]Let's end it with a big belly flop here, would you say?
[200:45.17]Oh, this.
[200:45.55]No.
[200:45.62]You don't want to give that to me?
[200:51.36]Crit.
[200:55.20]After the buzzer, I don't care.
[200:56.10]We'll kill him after the buzzer.
[200:58.06]Unsportsmanlike BM.
[201:03.93]They would be booze raining hell in this arena right now.
[201:07.19]Is that guy new?
[201:20.97]Susvane?
[201:21.45]Have we seen that guy before?
[201:34.83]Fans don't want to see honorable.
[201:36.11]They want to see blood.
[201:37.19]I remember this guy.
[201:42.45]Um... It's kind of similar to me.
[201:50.46]Very similar, except the speed.
[201:53.66]Just kind of have to chip away at him.
[202:01.21]That move is so good.
[202:02.01]I want to try the other one.
[202:10.58]Come on, pull it back.
[202:11.34]Enough to get there.
[202:11.94]Come on!
[202:15.08]I wanted to go for a big move there.
[202:16.30]It's alright.
[202:25.96]Long punches carrying?
[202:26.92]Oh, it's because it's S. That's the best thing you can get in these games.
[202:37.38]You're not gonna dodge that?
[202:38.38]You're not gonna dodge that, man.
[202:39.60]Really.
[202:44.93]Finally.
[202:47.23]Alright, I gotta do a move here.
[202:48.01]That's such poor shit.
[202:57.95]I think I lost this.
[203:01.05]I wasn't able to do any moves!
[203:13.52]I fucking lost.
[203:22.49]Can't get a goddamn roll to save my life.
[203:29.79]Fucking 60%, 60%, 60%.
[203:32.39]Go to Vegas and play those odds.
[203:33.65]You'll make a trillion dollars.
[203:46.32]What do we got?
[203:53.70]Getting close, actually.
[203:56.24]No do- holy fuck!
[204:05.75]Back it up!
[204:11.67]Back it up!
[204:12.75]Back it up!
[204:14.25]Dodge something!
[204:15.48]Jesus Christ, you have almost 400 fucking speed!
[204:18.18]Dodge something!
[204:19.68]Come on, man!
[204:32.77]Oh my god, you fucking have... What's going on now?
[204:35.98]I have no idea.
[204:37.76]What the fuck was that?
[204:44.76]I'm getting shit on by RNG gods right now.
[204:52.98]400 fucking speed almost, and I don't dodge any fucking moves.
[204:56.56]The guy had a 30-40% chance to hit the whole time.
[205:04.70]two milliseconds great this should have been easy money I I just got absolutely decimated we were just a full rank up and came in like third like almost second place
[205:29.76]And I rolled a set of dice ten times and lost the game because I rolled like twos every time.
[205:37.62]And nobody likes me anymore.
[205:45.93]I had to put a bullet in his brain.
[205:53.42]No, no, no, no.
[205:57.91]You have to stop backing up to long punch.
[205:59.79]Well, that doesn't... I mean, it doesn't matter.
[206:01.90]I still got hit by every single fucking move.
[206:05.72]With 364 speed.
[206:06.42]No.
[206:06.60]I just tried to not please.
[206:30.75]Send him to the farm.
[206:32.17]He is getting old.
[206:36.57]No, we're not killing him.
[206:46.55]The golden years of Sonic are gone.
[206:48.45]Yeah, Sonic 1 was great.
[206:49.59]Sonic 2 was great.
[206:50.49]Sonic 3 was very, very decent.
[206:54.31]And then it was awful.
[206:56.95]Look, let's let him die.
[206:58.29]He's gonna die here.
[206:59.21]Sonic 3, he'll die.
[207:01.49]After three years.
[207:03.29]And then we'll bring him back in ten years.
[207:06.19]So Sonic Generations can come out.
[207:08.89]And then let's kill him again.
[207:15.42]Sonic 3 was decent.
[207:23.94]It's time to live other dreams.
[207:26.60]That's so sad though.
[207:27.52]No, not yet.
[207:28.13]Not yet.
[207:30.90]Let's rest him.
[207:32.66]We almost won the B tournament.
[207:34.66]Just because we get unlucky over a series of rolls in a shitty tournament doesn't mean he's not worth playing with.
[207:45.60]What's coming up here?
[207:51.10]This is 5,000 gold.
[207:54.30]We're entering this.
[207:57.96]Let's drill some power.
[208:06.86]Try to get this to, like, 300.
[208:07.78]Let's set him free.
[208:17.53]Uh, we're gonna give him the cup of jelly again and see what's... Whatever the item is you get for five.
[208:25.25]I'm too attached to the beanbag.
[208:34.28]Just accept that he's not the same since he dabbed on the devil.
[208:42.67]Where's my item?
[208:44.75]Alright.
[208:54.84]We got one more.
[208:59.22]Rest and then try to win some money here, because even if we come in, like, second or third place...
[209:06.14]I didn't get it.
[209:06.60]It needs to be updated.
[209:19.45]Train two monsters until they're about to die and then fuse so the age resets.
[209:25.97]That's not a bad idea.
[209:28.51]One more chance at glory to win a bee cup.
[209:33.44]Use the banana.
[209:37.56]let's see what happens I don't know what that did that's how you play Monster Rancher alright well how do we how do I know if he's gonna die she'll tell me right so right when he's about to die we'll we'll freeze him
[210:06.99]And we'll go bring out Amy.
[210:09.29]No, that's terrible.
[210:10.66]I don't want to do... The guy even said that this combination was awful.
[210:14.90]Alright, let's do... Is he well right now?
[210:22.28]Is he tired?
[210:22.74]What is he?
[210:24.74]He's hurt one.
[210:30.66]How is he hurt?
[210:41.31]Maybe I should just let him rest then.
[210:50.77]Yeah, if I make some money here... Okay, he's at 50 loyalty.
[210:57.31]Let's do it.
[210:57.79]Let's try it.
[210:59.15]This is an opportunity to make at least a couple thousand here.
[211:02.93]Only four contestants.
[211:10.65]Bring in somebody from Monster Rancher 1.
[211:11.87]Alright, let's see what we got.
[211:22.79]Please no cigarette princes.
[211:27.94]Okay.
[211:29.48]Alright.
[211:30.72]This is potentially doable.
[211:34.72]This is the, uh... The dumb hermit crab, right?
[211:50.41]Yeah, this is the stupid hermit crab.
[211:54.63]I played this one last time.
[211:55.85]Maybe I should just do the cyclone.
[211:58.79]I'm gonna give it a try.
[212:02.42]Not yet, though.
[212:02.96]I was gonna say, if I get hit by that, that was 17 fucking percent.
[212:14.06]Give me a break.
[212:29.53]He's got terrible hip... Right as I say that, really, I get hit by a 20% move.
[212:36.69]Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[212:39.61]This is what I'm talking about.
[212:40.39]Like, what?
[212:41.43]If I did that, I would miss both times.
[212:48.26]He has such awful hip percentage back here.
[212:55.84]What the fuck?
[213:02.59]That's so dumb.
[213:19.15]How do you miss that often, and how do I get hit that often when he's rolling with weighted dice that all have ones and twos on them?
[213:37.70]That has nothing to do with the training, it has to do with rolling dice.
[213:40.36]His hit percentage was 17%, 20%, 20%, 17%.
[213:50.89]And I couldn't hit him with fucking 70 and 60.
[213:55.67]They call that a load of diarrhea.
[213:57.53]Is what they call that.
[214:03.99]Oh, this guy's gonna destroy me.
[214:13.62]I'm gonna lose here.
[214:14.86]No, I'm not.
[214:15.94]Watch this.
[214:17.36]I'm gonna get rolls here and I'm gonna win.
[214:27.90]Give me a break!
[214:44.52]Can something happen in this fight, please?
[214:47.30]I feel your pain, slug.
[214:50.52]Gotcha, I hit you in the teeth.
[215:04.24]Let's get him with a chop.
[215:15.55]One more long punch.
[215:19.97]There we go.
[215:22.25]There we go.
[215:22.63]I just guaranteed myself, like, $500.
[215:30.70]Just spam long punch from a distance.
[215:32.70]But I can't do that, though.
[215:35.80]Because that takes a lot of guts.
[215:38.68]It's 20, what, 27 guts?
[215:41.46]You can do that like two times before you're just kind of sitting around doing nothing.
[215:44.62]Alright, everybody's still... I just have to win the next match.
[215:54.31]I have to beat Epsilon.
[215:58.82]This is the big, slow... This is gonna be hard.
[216:05.83]This is the big dog.
[216:11.55]No, it's not.
[216:11.85]This is the weird missile lady.
[216:14.11]Right?
[216:15.77]I beat this... I got good rolls, though.
[216:17.79]This is gonna be tough.
[216:20.02]Just stay the fuck away from the intelligence moves.
[216:22.40]Pretty much any move.
[216:23.98]Just hope I dodge everything.
[216:27.00]First missile.
[216:27.90]Oh, fist missile.
[216:31.50]Give me the roll.
[216:31.98]Good.
[216:32.40]Got the roll.
[216:33.20]Back it up.
[216:44.54]Not good.
[216:53.87]How the fuck did I win this last time?
[217:01.44]It's because I dodged everything.
[217:05.86]Yeah, I should have lost.
[217:06.94]Absolutely.
[217:13.06]No foolery.
[217:13.68]Get it done.
[217:18.56]Yeah, how the hell did I win last time?
[217:23.52]Get in there.
[217:23.86]Come on.
[217:24.94]Just crit.
[217:26.82]No, don't crit me.
[217:27.62]Oh, lord.
[217:30.65]This is what should have happened last time.
[217:33.97]Motherfucker has like 30% more stats than me in every category.
[217:43.72]I take too long to do abilities?
[217:45.38]What?
[217:46.80]You have to!
[217:48.22]You can only do like one move every 10 seconds.
[217:59.85]And even when you do want to do a move, sometimes the monster just says, I'm not doing that, and spins around in a circle.
[218:07.99]Like 30% of the time, the monster just will not do the thing you told it to do, because it has a loyalty issue.
[218:23.32]He's upset!
[218:24.20]He's getting upset!
[218:24.96]No, I'm not.
[218:26.66]I told you we were gonna... Ah, it's only $150.
[218:33.72]Things are there.
[218:34.50]I think it's time.
[218:36.72]Now he's losing fans rapidly.
[218:39.44]You either live long enough to see yourself become the hero, or you die as a villain.
[218:48.11]Or something like that.
[218:50.55]Whatever that guy said.
[218:51.47]I learned a few lessons.
[219:07.56]Hey, good boy!
[219:08.42]I think it's done.
[219:14.71]He seems well.
[219:16.39]Let's take a look.
[219:19.03]Two and a half years old.
[219:21.43]Let's bring him to town.
[219:23.21]Let's save it first.
[219:28.01]He's got really, really good DNA.
[219:30.11]He's got good DNA.
[219:37.78]He did get to be, though, as a default trash monster, going up against these rares that I can't even pull out of CDs because I'm paywalled.
[219:50.38]You know, for the first run, did a great job.
[219:55.35]I would love to pull some of these other rare monsters out of these CDs, but I have to buy the rare monster DLC.
[220:06.43]Metal Beanbag Sonic.
[220:10.15]Let's take a look.
[220:10.71]Let's see what we got.
[220:12.60]We got some old monsters.
[220:16.66]Let's freeze them up.
[220:25.66]So who... Let's go to the shrine.
[220:26.88]Let's pull somebody out from the first game.
[220:31.50]Let's see what we have.
[220:32.66]Who's here that's worth fusing with?
[220:39.85]What's the second save file?
[220:42.45]Alright, we got Jexrex.
[220:44.95]Louise.
[220:46.03]KD.
[220:46.68]Volume.
[220:48.58]You're not allowed to reproduce this monster.
[220:51.94]We got DNA food.
[220:55.10]D-Sponge?
[220:58.02]Ratseratorps?
[220:59.64]Or Seadoze?
[221:05.79]I feel like DNA food might be good.
[221:09.17]Sonic and Jax Rex.
[221:15.65]Let's pull them all out.
[221:16.75]Let's pull Jax Rex out.
[221:17.85]Let's pull D-Sponge out.
[221:22.11]Let's get a couple of them out.
[221:29.70]D-Sponge has good stats.
[221:38.12]There he is.
[221:39.60]There's new and improved Jex Rex 2.0.
[221:48.34]Combine him with the gold cheat monster and the gold cheat monster is dead.
[221:51.60]He looks tired.
[222:02.71]He doesn't look healthy.
[222:03.73]He looks really unhealthy.
[222:08.03]I'm not sure I want to use him.
[222:17.36]Raise him up.
[222:18.92]And we'll pull out D-Sponge too.
[222:27.98]He's gonna die on the walk to the ranch.
[222:29.78]Alright.
[222:38.73]Looks like we got it.
[222:45.17]We got D-Sponge.
[222:48.89]I like that defense.
[222:50.53]Let's bring out D-Sponge and then DNA food.
[222:53.45]Pull him out.
[223:04.24]This is BB's future.
[223:05.78]It is.
[223:12.08]There he is.
[223:13.68]Hello.
[223:15.65]Just... the wall.
[223:20.31]There he is, D-Sponge is back.
[223:23.22]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wow, wow!
[223:30.20]237 defense space.
[223:33.28]Whoa, whoa.
[223:34.97]Whoa-ey, but 21 speed, yikes!
[223:46.58]Let's freeze them.
[223:47.62]Pull the other ones.
[223:48.20]And we'll take... We'll do a little bit of a... Comparison.
[223:53.60]Put them on ice.
[224:06.17]These are wall.
[224:06.75]They're not really known for speed.
[224:08.27]No, they're not.
[224:08.73]Let's pull out DNA food.
[224:17.08]What is on two?
[224:17.86]Do I have, like, two separate save files?
[224:22.84]I guess I had two different files for some reason, but, well, here's DNA food.
[224:31.73]Pull them out.
[224:40.39]You missed what happened to Sonic.
[224:41.27]Sonic's still here.
[224:42.55]He's just frozen.
[224:43.13]We're just trying to make some combinations.
[224:54.82]That's a cool-looking monster.
[224:55.90]They really don't want me to pull the worm out.
[225:01.57]I guess not.
[225:05.51]Pretty good power.
[225:06.07]Alright, now let's do some fusion.
[225:09.88]Let's try to make something interesting.
[225:17.82]Purple Satan.
[225:21.54]Freeze him.
[225:22.18]Save the game.
[225:22.82]Make sure we don't do any bogus moves.
[225:30.90]Shrunk his head a little.
[225:31.66]Save it.
[225:41.34]Let's do BB and D-Sponge.
[225:45.57]We'll try that first.
[225:48.94]Although, the first game might have been a little different, but the second game... So, all the stats, and all the time that I've played with... Sonic.
[225:59.83]It doesn't matter.
[226:00.59]Those stats don't make the base stats of the new monster any better, right?
[226:05.50]Or is that different in this game?
[226:07.38]How does that work?
[226:12.82]Should I play with one of these for a little while and get some stats?
[226:18.80]Or does that not matter?
[226:19.58]How does that work?
[226:34.14]Yes, it matters.
[226:35.85]You should train before fusing.
[226:37.13]Okay, because I'll do that.
[226:38.27]I will.
[226:40.81]So let's take a look.
[226:41.37]Let's get Beanbag Sonic.
[226:43.21]And D-Sponge.
[226:49.54]Just to look and see.
[226:50.32]Because I will use this dude.
[226:53.18]We'll go back to the fucking wall again.
[226:57.58]Secret seasoning.
[226:58.54]I don't... I mean, I don't have anything.
[227:00.12]Do I?
[227:00.44]I have a mint leaf.
[227:01.90]That's probably not going to do anything.
[227:05.78]Can't use it.
[227:08.05]This combination doesn't look good.
[227:11.41]You're going to get a blue sponge or a terror dog.
[227:15.11]No.
[227:15.71]Bad.
[227:19.93]What about Beanbag Sonic?
[227:22.17]We have to find a good combination.
[227:26.85]What about Beanbag and Jax Rex?
[227:33.75]The prospect here is unsure.
[227:37.43]Hound, Saurian, Zoom.
[227:39.35]It's like I already have a Zoom.
[227:42.62]No.
[227:46.34]Beanbag Sonic and DNA food.
[227:56.96]This one's all up to you.
[227:59.69]Okay, we already have... There's a chance to get a Striker.
[228:03.27]A Kabalos.
[228:07.79]Sonic and Amy.
[228:08.57]We did Sonic and Amy.
[228:09.35]It was a bad decision.
[228:10.41]Alright, Jax, Rex, and DNA food.
[228:22.51]No seasoning, what are we gonna get?
[228:28.92]I mean, what is that thing?
[228:30.98]Is it gonna just be a purple dog?
[228:38.88]Sponge and the rind.
[228:42.70]Alright, the rind.
[228:50.07]And the sponge.
[228:52.54]Two walls.
[228:53.28]I wonder what we're going to get from this.
[228:59.91]Another wall.
[229:01.07]A default wall.
[229:07.31]Get Bind of the Dinosaur.
[229:09.01]A super wall.
[229:09.83]What about Amy Conjuncto?
[229:13.21]And the Rind.
[229:19.13]Alright.
[229:21.05]Mustardy.
[229:23.81]Silhouette.
[229:26.33]Mustardy.
[229:29.85]There's a lot, a lot of things that can- I hope- I want mustard so bad.
[229:43.78]Silhouette is good.
[229:45.86]Let's try it.
[229:48.30]Who cares about Amy?
[229:53.47]Let's see what we got.
[230:04.56]No, no!
[230:07.62]No!
[230:27.03]Save's coming, flip it around.
[230:36.62]Flip this shit around.
[230:44.78]Good stats, yeah, but we don't want just a stupid cover of the game eye monster.
[230:53.19]to the lab.
[230:53.71]Let's flip it around.
[230:54.81]Even if we get something moderately interesting, I'll keep it.
[231:01.67]Okay, so that was Amy and then the Rhine, so it was the Rhine and then Amy, right?
[231:12.18]Should we flip it around that?
[231:13.04]That's how it's gonna work, right?
[231:14.42]Ooh.
[231:14.72]Sandy Mustardy.
[231:26.17]I'm gonna get SpongeBob Sandy up there.
[231:35.36]Rex and DNA?
[231:36.08]I'll do that after this.
[231:38.12]Let's hope we get Mustardy here.
[231:47.31]I want the Mustard Dog.
[231:52.75]Come on.
[231:54.27]Did we get it?
[231:55.87]Yes!
[231:57.03]We got Mustard.
[231:58.41]We got Tails.
[232:02.66]Oh, he sucks.
[232:06.20]He's awful.
[232:08.50]Looks dependable.
[232:12.27]I'm keeping him though.
[232:23.68]Dijon.
[232:25.50]Don't care what you want me to name it.
[232:27.30]It's Dijon.
[232:33.59]Freeze him.
[232:43.41]Jax, Rex, and DNA.
[232:44.17]Let's give it a try.
[232:51.69]Dijon, Tails, Prowler.
[232:56.53]Okay, hold on.
[232:57.25]Wait a minute.
[232:57.61]This is where it gets interesting.
[232:58.73]Jax, Rex, and DNA.
[232:59.93]You want me to try it, right?
[233:05.99]What's the possibility?
[233:10.80]Okay, we could get a Nagasaurion.
[233:13.18]Sauron.
[233:17.10]Save it.
[233:17.50]What do you mean?
[233:22.17]I'm gonna run out of money.
[233:29.07]Save data.
[233:29.69]Alright, I'm gonna make a second save file because I'm scared of losing all my money.
[233:38.22]New save.
[233:39.54]Let's try it.
[233:46.52]Let's try to get Sauron.
[233:54.71]Jax Rex.
[233:55.37]Damn it.
[234:03.61]Do you want a secret recipe?
[234:04.63]No.
[234:04.79]Alright, there's a half, more than 50% chance I'm gonna get this hour round.
[234:11.29]Let's try it.
[234:20.64]I think we got it.
[234:22.18]We got it!
[234:22.58]We got it!
[234:23.72]What does that mean?
[234:32.65]Why did you want me to have this?
[234:37.12]This thing is dumb.
[234:38.14]Okay, Bonnie.
[235:12.46]The moves check out the moves Claw and tail Alright, so should I think but what about mustard I
[235:39.00]Is Mustard any better?
[235:40.06]I want to see Mustard's moves.
[235:45.14]I refuse to delete Dijon.
[235:47.70]Use Mustard and Barney.
[235:57.06]Reset.
[235:57.60]Mustard is lame.
[235:58.82]Why?
[236:06.13]I don't know how much longer I can listen to this song, Joe.
[236:13.29]Well, who do we want to fucking play with?
[236:15.05]We have to take one of these bozos down to the ranch and level up a little bit and then con- confuse them with Sonic.
[236:21.20]So who's it gonna be?
[236:24.32]Who's it gonna be?
[236:24.90]Who are we playing with to fuse with Sonic?
[236:30.34]Let's make a poll.
[236:36.24]Are we playing with Dijon?
[236:37.12]Alright, here are your options.
[236:44.15]We have Dijon.
[236:46.57]Bonnie.
[236:54.06]Level up Bonnie.
[236:57.16]I'm gonna give you a pull.
[236:59.80]I'm gonna put a few things on here.
[237:10.61]Okay.
[237:11.65]Bonnie... God damn it, Windows.
[237:13.13]Get out of here.
[237:15.99]Bonnie... It's gonna end up being one of the dinosaurs.
[237:20.43]Bonnie or Dijon?
[237:24.11]I suck as not getting on this menu.
[237:28.59]Where's the eat clown ass?
[237:34.39]I think I just put that in.
[237:35.37]I think I made that up.
[237:37.57]I think I just read that and made up the rest of it.
[237:48.51]Did I?
[237:48.81]I don't know.
[237:53.45]Alright, so it's either Bonnie or Dijon.
[238:02.01]Check what the combo would be like.
[238:03.36]I can't because I don't have any more money.
[238:08.88]Kill Banana Spit.
[238:14.36]Looks like it's going to be Dijon.
[238:21.05]Bring it up.
[238:27.39]I don't think you can even check, can you?
[238:32.32]Can you?
[238:37.02]Just get back in there for a second.
[238:46.16]That has to hurt.
[238:48.64]Okay, combine.
[238:49.32]Let's see if we can even just do it first.
[238:52.60]We don't have enough money.
[238:53.40]See, we can't even do it.
[238:54.48]Fuck.
[238:58.89]How much is Beanbag Sonic worth?
[239:01.29]That's a great question.
[239:03.19]Oh, that's a good question.
[239:04.23]Are we about to sell him?
[239:05.97]I like that idea.
[239:07.21]And then Dijon is the new hotness, right?
[239:11.48]The new thing we want.
[239:14.22]Yeah, let's see what Beanbag Sonic sells for.
[239:19.02]I'm telling you right now, guys, if it's more than 5,000, we're doing it.
[239:22.77]If this is $10,000, I'm selling them.
[239:29.71]Welcome back.
[239:31.09]How you doing?
[239:32.63]Uh, sell.
[239:32.99]$10,000.
[239:33.01]Are you fucking kidding me?
[239:43.08]That's... That's less than a... That's less than it costs for a birthday cake in this game.
[239:50.37]You're talking about a B-level, highly trained, high-ranked monster.
[239:57.13]Give me a break.
[240:03.98]Back into the freezer.
[240:04.66]Alright, let's pull out Dijon and play with Dijon for a little bit.
[240:16.63]He's worth 10,000 to me, yeah.
[240:29.05]Less than 10 fans senior citizen washed up beanbag That's alright.
[240:36.74]He'll be fine.
[240:37.34]I want to see his moves though Claw and tail same thing.
[240:46.24]It's just a different color.
[240:53.50]That is a Digimon.

[241:13.85]Mustard Tails.
[241:16.29]Mustard Tails Prowess.
[241:19.02]Right?
[241:19.36]What is it?

[243:27.97]Immediately.
[243:28.95]Take him and no.
[243:31.81]Why does he look like shit?
[243:35.51]I should have named him Big Bird.
[243:41.21]He's Big Bird.
[243:42.43]That's not Tails, that's fucking Big Bird from Sesame Street with a bunch of blood on his back.
[243:53.22]He's the worst.
[244:01.84]Alright, I like him now.
[244:04.20]So what are we gonna train him here?
[244:05.57]Let's see, he's got good skill.
[244:08.19]I'm assuming he's a power-based monster.
[244:11.51]Do power, skill, and defense.
[244:15.51]Let's go with power.
[244:21.82]Let's see what he does to the three walls.
[244:28.54]You guys didn't like him?
[244:31.24]You wanted dabs?
[244:40.60]What?
[244:40.84]How?
[244:41.20]He cheated.
[244:41.92]That's fu- Why do you... He's gone as well.
[245:00.25]Look at that loyalty already.
[245:01.37]Yeah, he's gonna die.
[245:08.70]We want balance.
[245:10.16]That's right.
[245:11.92]So if we want balance in our monster of force, we need power, intelligence.
[245:19.01]Across the board.
[245:20.13]Power, intelligence.
[245:21.83]Focus on power.
[245:24.01]Ow.
[245:24.07]Alright, don't cheat again, please.
[245:32.97]Is that cheating?
[245:33.85]That seems more like cheating to me.
[245:42.96]We need that loyalty now.
[245:44.37]Kill him, I hate him.
[245:45.43]No, you guys chose him.
[245:52.73]Oh, fuck, I didn't know.
[245:53.33]What does he want for food?
[245:54.69]Well, you're getting milk.
[246:02.28]He does handstands instead of dabs.
[246:04.02]Alright, he's well.
[246:16.84]We need some more power.
[246:21.83]He cheated again.
[246:22.49]How do I prevent him from doing this?
[246:34.30]Okay, don't do that shit anymore.
[246:35.66]Because you're only getting one...
[246:50.09]There you go.
[246:52.89]Oh god, he can't do it unless he cheats.
[246:55.57]This guy sucks.
[247:21.47]You know, just take... Just relax.
[247:24.73]We're gonna see how he is in the battlefield.
[247:29.49]He's trying his best.
[247:30.61]He's cheated 50% of the time.
[247:35.46]He's lied to us a few times.
[247:39.84]You know?
[247:41.48]He's a liar.
[247:44.71]Let's see how he is in battle.
[247:48.43]E cup.
[247:51.11]Let him give it a try.
[247:52.71]He's gonna wow us here.
[247:57.17]BB never cheated.
[247:58.21]He was so good to us.
[247:59.21]Yes, but sometimes you have to train.
[248:03.36]He's only three weeks old.
[248:04.34]That's true.
[248:09.02]I hope he fucking dies.
[248:10.24]Jesus!
[248:15.30]I thought you guys liked the fucking mustard.
[248:26.42]We have a Mustard Mirror match coming up.
[248:30.94]We've got a triple M here.
[248:40.11]Only you like him.
[248:45.57]See?
[248:45.79]Doesn't he look funny with the... I can't... What's the thing in Hawaii that they put over your neck?
[248:52.81]Allay?
[248:54.61]Whatever it is.
[248:55.09]You know what I'm trying to say.
[248:56.31]Alright, go after him.
[249:02.53]It's alright.
[249:03.09]He's got really just general good moves.
[249:07.36]Pretty decent percentage.
[249:13.76]Look, he's going to win this tournament.
[249:14.72]He's going to win over all your hearts.
[249:31.12]Look at this.
[249:33.54]Untouchable.
[249:35.32]This is a free victory.
[249:38.39]See, we've got one guy in here.
[249:39.37]Plus one fan, right here.
[249:47.51]If he doesn't win the tournament, you have to put him down.
[249:49.05]Okay.
[249:50.39]Fine.
[249:53.54]If he loses this tournament, I will grind him up.
[249:57.27]And make a mustard smoothie.
[250:00.58]And feed it to the next monster.
[250:10.98]What happens if he cheats in a tournament?
[250:12.31]Do you get expelled?
[250:14.67]Let's do it.
[250:26.91]Clip that and use it as a contract.
[250:33.15]He's got terrible defense.
[250:38.43]And terrible skill.
[250:39.69]This will be easy.
[250:48.75]Tail swipe.
[250:51.29]Again.
[250:55.61]Good dodge.
[250:56.19]That was a good dodge.
[250:56.83]Look, don't you guys like him?
[250:57.81]He's like a Dark Souls character.
[250:58.93]He dodges.
[251:10.12]My friend.
[251:10.64]Oh, internet's dying.
[251:12.46]What do we do?
[251:12.90]What do we do?
[251:13.24]Internet's dying.
[251:13.68]What do I do?
[251:19.65]Um.
[251:22.25]I've got to make something happen here.
[251:26.35]Stunlock him.
[251:30.63]Come on, I got to play the percentages.
[251:33.55]No!
[251:34.67]I don't want to bury him.
[251:36.31]Come on, get a crit.
[251:40.97]He's dead.
[251:41.49]No.
[251:50.22]Oh, my side.
[251:51.04]Oh.
[251:54.07]No.
[251:55.21]Send him out back.
[252:03.25]But that title, the stream title.
[252:05.47]I don't want to take the stream title off.
[252:12.71]I love that stream title.
[252:15.13]I'm just going to leave it.
[252:15.85]I don't give a fuck.
[252:18.19]I'm keeping that stream title until the stream's over.
[252:34.85]Just add R.I.P.
[252:38.39]Why can't we get one of those funny ones?
[252:40.73]The funny weird whale gremlins.
[252:42.41]I want one of those.
[252:46.48]This guy is so bad.
[252:48.14]If we lose to this guy, then I am bringing him out back.
[252:50.34]Get up there.
[253:00.97]Please.
[253:06.85]Make the mustard into custard.
[253:13.87]I got no guts.
[253:18.67]Really?
[253:27.28]Yeah, he's not good.
[253:29.50]He's a default dinosaur.
[253:32.34]That has bad manners because he was mixed with a Swayzo.
[253:39.98]I'm trying to do moves and I can't do them.
[253:42.38]He just won't do them.
[253:58.11]Alright, let's take him out back.
[254:11.92]Let the AI fight.
[254:14.04]No, this is the mirror, okay?
[254:14.90]I'm going to let the AI fight.
[254:18.01]This is the mustard mirror match.
[254:22.25]This is the marvelous metamorphosizing mustard marvelous match.
[254:25.75]Mirror match.
[254:28.89]I should win this.
[254:30.13]I should win the mustard marvelous mirrored immutable marriage match.
[254:39.11]Vegas Proud.
[254:49.26]Come on.
[254:49.52]You're fighting the same exact thing as you.
[254:51.66]Come on!
[254:56.10]This one gets to be the real mustard dinosaur.
[255:01.35]Finally.
[255:05.09]Which is which?
[255:05.91]I don't... Yeah.
[255:06.95]Here you go.
[255:08.15]You can take whatever lore you want from this.
[255:11.03]Because the real Dijon is going to survive.
[255:16.61]So it doesn't matter.
[255:17.27]You don't know which one is which anyways.
[255:25.32]Do we need to face-scan for this?
[255:27.08]No, we don't.
[255:27.70]Which one do I shoot?
[255:31.60]Which one do I... I don't know.
[255:34.48]I have an idea.
[255:35.90]Shoot them both.
[255:36.53]I think ours won.
[255:45.19]Yes.
[255:56.47]I'm not giving you a nose cam.
[256:07.12]No, you're not getting a nose cam!
[256:09.40]I'm not doing that.
[256:10.24]Yeah, don't worry.
[256:20.90]I'm gonna stream my colonoscopy in like a couple weeks.
[256:24.55]Would you guys want me to do that?
[256:25.89]What if I streamed my colonoscopy?
[256:32.41]The only reason why I'm doing this is because we're going to make like a couple hundred dollars.
[256:44.10]Does that break terms of service?
[256:47.76]Like inside of my intestines and stuff, look at the camera.
[256:50.38]Is that breaking terms of service?
[256:53.96]Like Twitch Osmosis Jones inside of a streamer?
[256:57.10]Has anyone ever done that?
[257:03.54]It's educational, right?
[257:04.42]I mean, that's technically medical science, medical knowledge, right?
[257:20.41]Gonna stream my colonoscopy with Drake.
[257:24.27]He's just angry.
[257:25.61]What is going on?
[257:26.89]He's infuriated.
[257:30.83]He's so fucking mad.
[257:34.01]He's just on fire right now because he knows he's so terrible.
[257:36.53]He knows he's losing.
[257:41.27]He's losing to an overripe strawberry.
[257:44.68]I would be pissed off too.
[257:53.63]He might actually pull it back here and win.
[257:56.36]Yeah.
[257:58.42]Did he win?
[257:59.28]No.
[258:02.88]Mad because bad.
[258:04.02]Yeah, see, I can say that now because it's not me controlling him.
[258:09.30]So we're going to rewind back to before he was ever born.
[258:12.17]And we're going to save that money.
[258:28.94]Just pretend he was never born.
[258:36.40]150 gold not worth it.
[258:41.79]Zero fans.
[258:47.57]Go back in time and get rid of him.
[258:50.09]Oh god, my internet.
[258:51.03]Stop it.
[258:59.86]Am I still gonna have Barney?
[259:01.76]Find out.
[259:04.46]He learned a lesson.
[259:06.24]One, two, three.
[259:10.24]Praise him.
[259:12.94]Good work.
[259:14.75]At least he tried.
[259:15.49]Look at these potatoes.
[259:21.43]Okey-doke.
[259:32.07]He learned he's getting put down.
[259:33.37]Uh, half off training.
[259:38.51]Can't afford it.
[259:43.39]Wait, do I have mail again?
[259:48.63]Double sale.
[259:50.07]Too bad you're useless.
[259:53.73]No, no, no, no.
[259:54.19]Go back.
[259:55.69]No!
[259:56.62]I wanted to press no.
[260:03.04]File.
[260:11.60]Remember I loaded the second save because I was like, I don't know about this.
[260:14.59]I'm not so sure about this.
[260:15.75]Well, it turned out I was right.
[260:17.87]I always have to listen to my intuition.
[260:28.11]Rest in peace, Mustard.
[260:33.53]So who do we have now?
[260:42.61]What is the... So we have... Okay, this... Shit, we have Dijon.
[260:47.09]We gotta go back even further.
[260:48.47]We have to go back further.
[260:55.52]We can try another CD.
[261:05.29]Yeah, we're going to change the timeline here.
[261:11.23]Change the title.
[261:11.91]What's the title now?
[261:18.89]How about Seek and You Shall Find.
[261:25.93]And then dot, dot, dot.
[261:26.97]Monsters.
[261:35.96]Nah, alright.
[261:36.88]Should I do it?
[261:38.04]It's already there.
[261:45.82]Not... Everyone hates this.
[261:49.76]I hate this.
[261:53.32]Oh, it hurts to look at that.
[261:54.46]No.
[262:01.81]I'm not doing it.
[262:06.89]seeking um how about like a male seeking because if we're looking for monsters male seeking strong monster to take to championship male seeking strong monster to take the champ to championship
[262:37.46]Desperate streamer seeks monster companion.
[262:41.66]I like that one.
[262:42.82]Desperate streamer seeks monster companion.
[263:02.07]It's not that's... is that incorrect?
[263:04.08]It's actually true.
[263:10.51]I need a monster companion to take us to the championship.
[263:16.80]Alright, let's go to the shrine.
[263:25.70]Let's... All we've gotten is terrible, terrible stuff from our discs.
[263:33.24]You know what I mean?
[263:33.86]Like, we've gotten really bad luck.
[263:36.61]Should I put the Elvis Presley CD back in this one?
[263:39.17]We'll try Elvis.
[263:42.23]You saw this last time.
[263:43.23]You don't have to show it.
[263:43.95]I could be lying to you though.
[263:47.70]This could be Big Mama's house.
[263:49.78]I could just be making it up.
[263:50.80]I could be lying to you.
[263:53.26]Now you'll never know and it's gonna eat you up inside not knowing exactly what I just put in.
[264:07.46]Metallica.
[264:17.64]Hmm, wonder what it was.
[264:18.36]There comes the music again.
[264:25.91]Alright, give us no rare monster, just something interesting.
[264:33.46]Finally.
[264:34.52]Give us something cool.
[264:50.58]Something interesting, worth confusing.
[264:53.26]Now that is what I'm talking about.
[264:55.18]That is a shaved Wilford Brimley walrus cat.
[265:00.18]I'm liking it.
[265:07.78]Curious.
[265:09.96]Holy shit.
[265:11.03]Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
[265:13.27]Yes, yes, yes.
[265:21.89]Kill it before it breeds?
[265:23.03]No.
[265:23.95]Let it live so it continues to breed too many offspring.
[265:27.77]Alright, we gotta get this good.
[265:34.72]What does he look like?
[265:35.28]He's a, uh... I don't know.
[265:40.50]Um... It's the Lorax.
[265:45.44]The Lorax.
[265:48.47]It's not the Lorax.
[265:49.49]The Lorax was yellow.
[265:50.77]The Lorax was orange.
[265:57.02]Maybe that's... You know, that might be like the Lorax fetus, but that's not like the Lorax.
[266:02.46]That's like The Binding of Isaac Lorax.
[266:05.95]Okay.
[266:13.39]Isaac Lorax?
[266:21.30]Isaac?
[266:21.64]How do we just call him Isaac?
[266:24.50]How do you combine Isaac and Lorax?
[266:31.16]Wilford Brimley?
[266:34.71]The binding of Brimley?
[266:35.81]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[266:45.94]Lorax Brimley?
[266:46.86]I like that.
[266:52.42]Sir Isaac Lorax.
[266:58.91]I mean, this could be Big the Cat, but I like Lorax Brimley.
[267:05.79]Does it fit, though?
[267:07.01]I have no idea how you spell his last name.
[267:09.03]Lorax Brimley.
[267:09.85]Is it gonna fit?
[267:25.98]Lorax Brimley.
[267:27.40]Okay, well, it's not gonna be perfect.
[267:32.12]There, Lorax Brimley.
[267:34.44]It's two Ms, but sometimes, yeah, I don't want to... Look, this isn't a guy's screen name.
[267:39.98]This is a person's first and last name.
[267:52.46]This is the one we're training.
[267:55.28]It's good enough.
[267:56.58]Save it.
[268:00.19]I hope he doesn't suck.
[268:03.45]Sonic characters only.
[268:18.17]Look how much of a weirdo this guy's going to be.
[268:20.27]He's going to have all kinds of strange noises.
[268:21.84]He's going to move his hands around.
[268:23.28]I bet you he puts his hands in his mouth, Two Fingers, and goes like booga booga booga.
[268:26.26]You know, he's going to open his mouth and he's going to be like... Watch.
[268:30.28]In fact, I would put any amount of money on that.
[268:32.32]He's going to put Two Fingers like this, you know, on either side, and his tongue is going to come out.
[268:38.30]Watch.
[268:45.42]Oh, he's such a creep.
[268:48.05]Do it.
[268:50.99]That was close enough.
[268:53.26]That was one hand up on the jaw, and his tongue came out and his mouth opened.
[268:55.98]That was close enough.
[268:56.58]I don't have to pay any money.
[269:02.80]What is his drink?
[269:11.12]Alright, let me see his moves.
[269:12.21]He's got crazy base stats, though.
[269:14.11]His int is insane.
[269:19.77]Okay, he likes milk.
[269:21.43]Easy.
[269:21.80]He's nice.
[269:22.34]He's cheap.
[269:24.18]That's so cheap.
[269:24.92]Now we got Thrust Claw and Slash Claw.
[269:31.90]Oh lord, he's gonna be really bad.
[269:34.17]I am not taking him into any tournament until we get an Intelligence move.
[269:43.07]Because I won't be able to hurt anyone.
[269:46.28]That'll be a disaster.
[269:53.32]Right away, send him to get an intelligence move.
[269:55.28]You better believe it.
[269:58.81]Give me one second.
[270:02.05]Let's shake off the third leg of this stream here.
[270:06.89]That actually is like naked Garfield.
[270:10.83]I'm going to pee one more time.
[270:12.38]Come back and we'll do a little bit of training with him.
[270:15.46]Maybe a couple of battles.
[270:17.82]And call it for tonight and pick it up again tomorrow.
[270:21.46]We'll be playing this tomorrow again.
[270:26.73]So just give me a moment.
[270:28.07]I shall return.
[270:31.97]See you in two minutes.
[270:55.34]I fucked that up.
[270:56.77]Too much.
[272:20.56]Thank you.
[273:25.22]You know, sometimes I like to pretend that I'm like 60 feet tall by something I'll describe here.
[273:36.35]Let's head back here.
[273:47.58]Okay.
[273:52.38]So, anybody else do this?
[273:56.83]So, any time I get one of these little, little baby cans, and you hold it like this, I like to just kind of think that I'm, like, I'm, like, standing above the trees.
[274:05.17]You know what I mean?
[274:07.59]With these tiny cans in your hands, you just feel like you're fucking, like, a hundred feet tall.
[274:12.09]You can do it in one sip.
[274:13.95]Oh, watch this.
[274:17.90]Let me get that in the camera.
[274:18.80]See what I mean?
[274:22.96]Like, I'm 75 feet tall.
[274:26.72]Al Bundy.
[274:29.51]Paul Bunyan.
[274:32.37]Jolly Green Giant.
[274:33.15]Who's the tall guy?
[274:48.22]What the fuck?
[274:50.35]Wow.
[274:52.23]Fucking huge.
[275:06.28]Why do I have prowess?
[275:10.18]Looked up on the dictionary.
[275:11.18]I don't understand.
[275:14.81]Why?
[275:16.63]Weird.
[275:19.01]Okay.
[275:19.69]Well, let's go.
[275:32.66]Still playing.
[275:33.20]Yeah, we're gonna wrap it up here in a little bit.
[275:36.76]I want to fight with him once.
[275:37.98]Train him a couple times.
[275:40.84]And we'll wrap it up and start again tomorrow.
[275:43.42]Because I am having a fucking blast.
[275:47.82]Alright, here we go.
[275:50.30]Oh, when's the first fight?
[275:51.69]We can do one right now.
[275:55.69]But we can't.
[275:57.71]Because he needs to train.
[275:59.07]Oh, I need money.
[276:03.15]I'm not sure this is going to work out.
[276:11.37]Because I need to win battles to make money.
[276:15.52]He's not going to win any battles.
[276:18.40]He might, but if I get hit... To get an intelligence move, I need $2,000. $2,000.
[276:39.08]Yeah, these are just... they're power type.
[276:44.41]These are power moves.
[276:52.00]Hmm.
[276:58.12]Farm with Sonic?
[276:59.68]I could do that.
[277:06.96]Yeah, it's gonna be a waste of time.
[277:09.89]Back to the farm with you.
[277:13.09]Let's just get like two or three thousand dollars with Sonic.
[277:16.03]I'm back.
[277:23.25]What the fuck happened?
[277:24.23]A lot.
[277:26.13]What happened to Beavis?
[277:27.03]He's alright.
[277:27.45]We're about to see him again.
[277:33.62]Man, I'm hungry.
[277:35.60]I'm getting hungry right now, but I'm too invested.
[277:37.68]Okay, that's, uh... It's a little much.
[277:51.63]Very, uh... Wow.
[277:55.76]Okay.
[278:04.61]Ring a bell, let's win some easy tournaments for some easy money.
[278:10.95]I can't turn off the music.
[278:16.03]What is this?
[278:16.37]Hi, what do you want?
[278:17.11]No, nothing.
[278:19.85]You guys, you don't understand?
[278:20.63]Like, there is no turning the sounds off.
[278:22.75]There's no options menu.
[278:23.85]This is a PlayStation 1 game.
[278:25.56]There's no... I can't... Maybe if I quit to the title screen...
[278:39.06]But who's got time for that?
[278:40.02]Alright, what have we got?
[278:49.24]We have C. We should be able to win this.
[278:51.90]Right?
[278:54.64]Like, that's... Come on.
[278:56.45]This isn't... I should easily... I'm gonna let him win.
[278:59.77]I'm gonna let him play.
[279:00.69]I'm gonna get disk chips, too.
[279:05.59]So that... Just let him win.
[279:10.07]I'm going to let the computer play.
[279:11.21]I'm just going to watch with you guys.
[279:12.79]I'm going to be in chat.
[279:15.75]So this is what I imagine.
[279:16.75]I'm going to be a Twitch viewer, a Twitch chatter right now.
[279:20.42]Let's go.
[279:20.74]I'm going to be in the chat with you guys.
[279:31.98]If there's a camera pointed at you guys right now, this is probably what you'd be doing.
[279:44.48]You guys don't have a mic, so...
[280:12.54]Thank you.
[282:05.04]Thank you.
[283:36.72]This is not going so well, by the way.
[283:40.33]You guys wanted the AI to do this?
[283:46.25]He's lost to every fucking single match!
[283:48.95]And I was the problem before!
[283:50.47]I haven't done anything!
[283:54.54]I've been with you guys!
[283:55.74]I've been- I- I- I've been with you guys the whole time!
[284:00.08]My hands were off the controller, I was hanging out with you.
[284:02.70]That's my excuse.
[284:06.85]Now I've lost fucking both matches.
[284:15.95]I was just watching.
[284:22.64]Watch this.
[284:25.92]You and me.
[284:27.04]Turn off the fucking webcam.
[284:28.46]I don't do webcams.
[284:34.70]Oh, I'm gonna lose.
[284:41.95]We need a new streamer.
[284:43.55]And watch this.
[284:44.13]I'll show you how the... You know what?
[284:45.79]You saw that movie with the AI?
[284:50.19]I'll show you why us humans are never going away.
[284:59.44]I thought I was still on webcam for a second.
[285:11.29]Nope.
[285:23.53]Yeah, you're never gonna get rid of us humans, are ya?
[285:25.19]Alright, we're pretty even.
[285:31.77]Tasty banana, what did he do?
[285:36.27]Oh, wow, that was a good banana.
[285:38.36]Nice work.
[285:40.10]You think you can beat a fucking human?
[285:44.30]Just like in chess.
[285:45.78]What was it?
[285:46.68]The computer?
[285:47.34]Lookit.
[285:50.54]I will go webcam for this.
[285:54.05]I'm a goddamn human, okay?
[285:56.35]You're never gonna beat me.
[285:57.44]Bring as much computer technology and AI as you want.
[285:59.78]You'll never beat the fucking true brain of the operations.
[286:28.76]Do you think?
[286:29.70]Was my face like... Was it like this?
[286:31.98]It was like... I fucking love that.
[286:40.96]I love that it takes the last known image.
[286:51.39]I'm about this far away from an Alex Jones rant?
[286:54.37]What?
[287:01.11]Did I win any fucking cash?
[287:24.55]Boo!
[287:34.09]Got you.
[287:50.30]Look at this person.
[287:57.56]I lost four fans because I just did that.
[287:59.10]Sorry, guys.
[288:00.67]Do you hear my voice right now?
[288:02.40]I have like an air bubble in my throat.
[288:04.74]Do you hear how different I am?
[288:05.54]This is insane.
[288:06.10]Listen to this.
[288:07.58]I sound completely different right now.
[288:10.16]There, see?
[288:10.50]Isn't that weird?
[288:11.08]Isn't that weird?
[288:16.13]Look at all those stats.
[288:26.43]Yeah, he's gonna be dead soon anyways.
[288:27.96]Praise him.
[288:37.02]We didn't win any money, by the way.
[288:38.22]Did we have to seriously go down even further?
[288:40.70]I mean, the goal here was to have him win for us, but it's not gonna happen.
[288:52.80]I have to take control of the situation.
[289:00.94]Just give him... I need two thousand dollars.
[289:07.23]I can't waste money on him right now.
[289:10.54]Let's get the cup.
[289:11.58]Cup of jelly.
[289:12.14]Because I want the... Got a star underneath.
[289:19.08]Come on.
[289:24.82]Nothing.
[289:25.18]Come on.
[289:25.70]Give me a break.
[289:31.61]Is the... Okay, is the training... Is it half off?
[289:33.53]Half off?
[289:36.99]See ya.
[289:42.82]How much money do I have?
[289:44.64]Bye.
[289:44.96]Go to town.
[289:46.22]Don't even need him anymore.
[289:53.06]Freeze him and bring back Brimley and do intelligence training.
[289:57.11]Try to get an intelligence move.
[290:10.72]Does time go by when you go from ranch to ranch?
[290:15.12]I'm not going to put him down.
[290:18.06]What are you talking about?
[290:29.17]He's back.
[290:29.57]Let's get these terrifying Wolverine claws.
[290:41.59]The sad Isaac dab.
[290:53.25]Alright, I think... I'm starting to get a little tired out here.
[290:57.15]I'm getting a little sleepy.
[291:03.47]So let's train him, see if we can get another move.
[291:06.47]And I'm probably gonna call it.
[291:10.45]We'll pick it up here.
[291:14.83]So we need, we're talking about intelligence.
[291:21.68]Heavy tech, withering, hit tech, sharp tech.
[291:25.92]I mean, am I going to get an intelligence move here?
[291:27.74]There's a chance to acquire a new technique here.
[291:35.73]This is the only place I would assume we could get it, right?
[291:46.19]you said six hours well it'll be pretty close to that once we uh do our little end of the stream wrap up here the technique uh there is no special it's only these at the moment only these
[292:14.62]At least he'll be really smart.
[292:16.86]Let's do it.
[292:27.56]That's fine, that's the next official tournament.
[292:35.10]Monkey Race.
[292:44.48]Why am I always so broke?
[292:46.44]Because I spend my money on monsters.
[292:52.15]He's doing a good job.
[292:55.63]Good.
[292:57.95]No new technique.
[292:58.81]Come on, man.
[293:11.54]Make this worth it.
[293:13.98]Otherwise, I'm not going to be able to really use them.
[293:19.96]Nice.
[293:21.00]Technique.
[293:22.92]Ah.
[293:25.57]Shit.
[293:30.51]They usually get it on the first go there.
[293:34.81]Sonic got hurt here.
[293:38.81]Please.
[293:40.09]You can do it.
[293:40.61]Don't get crushed.
[293:44.32]Oh, come on, dude.
[293:45.18]Don't do it.
[293:45.70]Move out of the way.
[293:46.96]Good work.
[293:50.43]He's taking a sip of his drink.
[293:52.63]That's a coconut water.
[293:56.29]Spy kind of guy.
[293:59.87]Last stage, big gorilla.
[294:00.99]Here we go.
[294:10.90]Wilford Brimley versus King Kong.
[294:16.87]That was so lame!
[294:19.31]That's all you're gonna do.
[294:20.07]What's he doing?
[294:27.88]Am I just trying to be as annoying as possible?
[294:34.56]I guess this is intelligent.
[294:36.22]Until he sees you.
[294:53.84]Alright, I'm going to bed.
[295:00.81]I'm going to bed.
[295:01.85]He likes milk.
[295:02.71]Give him milk.
[295:03.29]That's all we can afford.
[295:04.33]I love this game.
[295:15.38]No, he got to level two of intelligence.
[295:17.26]That's okay.
[295:20.37]Oh, is it gonna be more discounts?
[295:26.32]It's alright.
[295:30.34]No money.
[295:36.60]Save the game!
[295:38.22]Save data.
[295:44.72]Now, we are going to keep slot 1 open.
[295:48.10]We're going to close it on slot 2.
[295:50.24]Just in case there's some kind of disaster and we have to go back to 1.
[295:53.12]You know what I'm saying?
[295:57.83]But anywho, thank you everybody for sticking around.
[296:01.21]We will continue Monster Hunter.
[296:02.83]Stop that calling it Monster.
[296:04.79]Monster Rancher 2.
[296:05.61]Tomorrow.
[296:06.88]Tomorrow.
[296:08.77]Because we're off schedule tomorrow.
[296:11.62]I can't give you an exact time, but it's gonna be... We'll start at some point after 6 and before 8.
[296:19.32]So, probably around the same time.
[296:24.93]So let's move over here to the... Not the VRF back screen.
[296:31.83]The credits!
[296:32.27]Credits!
[296:33.86]And yes, I did speed this up by about 20%.
[296:36.22]So I told you I wasn't going to miss one.
[296:37.76]I'm not going to.
[296:40.55]I made it about 25 seconds faster.

[303:00.58]Where are those bits?
[303:03.39]Speaking of bits, so I'm gonna just give 50 bucks It was Nick underscore it was Nick super underscore Thank you for the $50 dude, they just say I like you I Like you too, you just gave me $50.

[303:37.63]Kairotobi currently is... on the top of the bits right now.
[303:43.29]Thank you, dude.
[303:44.78]Appreciate it.
[303:45.30]Jerma, BBs is performing poorly because you spoiled him to the point of dotting, which is the highest extreme of the spoil spectrum.
[303:53.24]Monsters who are spoiled can't get higher than 50 loyalty and reduces their lifespan.
[303:58.63]Dab.
[303:59.23]Feed him smoked snakes until it says even.
[304:06.42]But everybody gets mad when I punish him.
[304:09.30]Okay.
[304:14.22]Thank you for the tip.
[304:17.35]Will do for next time.
[304:21.99]the top of the spectrum.
[304:25.79]Thank you both of you, though, for your $10 and your $50 here, Nick.
[304:28.75]Thank you so much.
[304:29.39]I guess we'll go from front to back here.
[304:32.63]Thank you.
[304:32.99]We're going to do this right now.
[304:34.37]Oh, man.
[304:38.71]Well, Nick, I like like you.
[304:45.00]Thank you for your $100 admission of love.
[304:50.30]I appreciate it.
[304:51.81]Thank you, dude.
[304:56.73]Unfortunately, sorry to say, I'm currently taken to the school dance.
[305:02.63]But thank you for the $100 in three minutes.
[305:09.31]Very kind of you, very generous.
[305:12.74]I'll use that money to buy way more CDs to put into this fucking console to get more monsters.
[305:20.20]Thanks, dude.
[305:23.76]You are awesome.
[305:26.18]Love story ruined.
[305:30.88]Thank you, Cosmic Cosm, for the $1.
[305:32.77]Hey, Jeremy, I turned 19 today.
[305:33.91]Just wanted to say thank you for the awesome streams.
[305:35.45]Happy birthday, Cosmic.
[305:40.01]Happy birthday.
[305:43.23]Another year older, another year wiser, and I was 19 at some point in my life.
[305:50.44]Thank you.
[305:51.70]Hope you had a good day.
[305:52.90]We've got some cool stuff.
[305:54.42]A lot of birthdays!
[305:55.02]We've had like three or four people say it was their birthdays over the last day or two.
[305:59.32]Like five to ten... Is it possible that like... How many people are on Earth?
[306:03.60]Like 11 billion?
[306:05.18]And there was what?
[306:05.66]Like two... 2,500?
[306:07.20]3,000 people here tonight?
[306:08.70]Like concurrent watching?
[306:11.06]So of like the 3,000 concurrent viewers that were on this stream... I wonder... Like what's the percentage of how many people's birthday was it today in the world?
[306:24.23]Not even close to 11.
[306:24.95]Yeah, but I mean, like, forget about it, right?
[306:33.04]7 billion.
[306:33.38]Wasn't it 7 billion, like, 15, 20 years ago?
[306:35.39]What are you guys on about here?
[306:38.73]What?
[306:39.05]Hold on.
[306:52.95]What's the world's population in 2018?
[306:54.90]The world population projected to reach 10 billion by 2050.
[306:58.02]See?
[306:58.30]I'm talking about, like, the future.
[307:02.50]I plan my future accordingly.
[307:05.18]Forget about it.
[307:07.70]Anyways.
[307:10.91]What the hell was I just saying?
[307:16.63]Oh, right.
[307:17.21]How many people's birthday is it today in the world?
[307:21.99]And how many of those people are here?
[307:23.04]I don't know.
[307:26.44]But thank you.
[307:27.92]Also thank you to Maxi, Maxi Kaspersky.
[307:31.98]Thanks for the $1.
[307:34.36]Hey, you missed that one, try another.
[307:37.20]Thank you.
[307:38.82]Thank you to the Pat Matterson, the Pat Marsons.
[307:44.11]Thanks for the $1.
[307:44.89]Here's another chance to say my name right.
[307:53.30]oh fuck me seriously the the pat marsons got it active pudding thank you for the one dollar I've been sick for all of my spring break but being able to end it with four Jerma streams in a row is just awesome thanks for everything you do man love you well I'm sorry to hear that you've been sick for your spring break
[308:19.57]It's so funny you're saying spring break and it's like 20 degrees outside right now.
[308:23.47]For me.
[308:26.01]But Massachusetts only gets two seasons.
[308:27.59]It's horrible.
[308:29.81]We get three seasons.
[308:30.59]We get winter, summer, and dog shit.
[308:35.06]It's six to seven months a year of dog shit.
[308:37.90]Then we get a terrible winter.
[308:39.88]And then it's summer for two months.
[308:45.62]But...
[308:48.03]uh wish you a swift recovery in your illness thank you so much pudding much love to you uh paper bow tie thanks for the five dollars damn it I forgot to put a message in my last cheer but uh beanbag Sonic looks like a spurt of some goddamn shaving cream oh I love shaving cream
[309:12.03]Good old-fashioned Barbasol, just... It's so fun to smush around in your hands.
[309:17.57]I love the way it smells.
[309:20.85]I don't shave with it, though, because... I don't like the way it feels on my face.
[309:25.59]But I do like the way that it smells and feels.
[309:27.27]Barbasol is amazing.
[309:29.19]I'm serious.
[309:32.87]I don't eat it.
[309:38.47]Yeah, well, here it is, right?
[309:49.09]Sometimes it's hard to find a game that's just... we can just kind of hang out and play and have fun with for five, six hours of stream.
[309:59.81]I feel like a lot of times, at least like newer games and games that are, I guess you'd call them like, popular, in quotes,
[310:09.52]I don't really... I don't like them.
[310:12.64]Like, they don't really grab me.
[310:15.28]As much as they probably used to.
[310:21.28]It's much easier just to sit here and be able to... And we all know exactly what's gonna happen here.
[310:25.26]Right?
[310:27.00]We're just training monsters and just having fun and hanging out.
[310:30.96]Especially with the newer games and some of the more competitive games.
[310:33.36]Like, you have to be on top of the game.
[310:34.56]You gotta play fucking your ass off.
[310:38.69]I do like these kind of just hang out and chill games.
[310:42.89]Although they're not... They're very far... There's very few in between.
[310:46.44]There's very like few and far between of like where you can find these.
[310:54.12]Because think about like... I have a lot of problem.
[310:57.79]You guys already know this.
[310:58.81]This is not a fucking... This is not news to any of you here.
[311:04.14]But games that allow this kind of hands-off approach, I have the most fun with.
[311:11.99]Sure, it's really fun to ride around with, you know, driving a car in GTA and like, you know, run somebody over and like, oh, there's a guy there.
[311:18.31]Like, I love the open world insanity games like GTA.
[311:21.77]Even like Kingdom Come is really funny and really fun.
[311:25.23]True Crime, like any games that allow like open world where you can kind of just go at your own pace and do whatever you want are fun.
[311:30.15]And they have a lot of things you can do.
[311:32.68]But hands-off approach games where, like, interesting things can happen and you can sit here and we can just talk and have fun... I prefer.
[311:40.06]If that makes any sense.
[311:49.41]So, I guess that's where I am now.
[311:50.99]At least, in gaming.
[311:52.17]Because I have a lot of, like, tension problems and... If I played, like, a game like Fortnite or PUBG or even...
[312:02.80]Even games that require a lot of attention to detail and attention to... Because I look at chat all the time.
[312:10.05]I'm always looking at chat.
[312:11.31]I always want to see what you guys are saying, like talking to you guys and stuff, so... I like being able to do that more often than not.
[312:19.05]And I get myself into a lot of trouble because I try to do both in a game that requires a lot of attention to be paid to.
[312:25.39]I don't pay attention to it.
[312:26.47]And I'm like, what's chat saying?
[312:27.79]I want to talk to you guys.
[312:29.69]And something terrible happens or I miss a whole part of the game or I don't listen or I don't see what was on the screen and it frustrates me.
[312:40.10]Pretty much what I'm trying to say is get ready for the Drake co-stream.
[312:46.23]Is that true?
[312:47.19]Was it like a million people watching that stream?
[312:49.74]I didn't even open it.
[312:50.50]I just heard about it.
[313:02.81]Holy shit, there was 600,000 people.
[313:03.97]That's insane.
[313:06.95]How do you even run the website still if that many people are on one page?
[313:15.17]But that doesn't mean that I'm not going to ever play games that require attention.
[313:18.82]Obviously.
[313:21.80]Like, did we play all through Demon's Souls?
[313:24.62]Like, last year?
[313:26.14]When Dark Souls 1, the remaster comes out, even though I guess it's not what everybody thought it was going to be, I'm going to play that.
[313:31.56]Probably be the whole thing.
[313:32.27]I don't know why I wouldn't.
[313:40.83]But that's my headspace.
[313:42.47]It just got in my head a little bit there.
[313:45.28]I opened the door, let you guys in.
[313:46.54]You swam around a little bit in the public pool that's up there.
[313:48.82]And then I flushed you.
[313:52.32]Now you're back out sitting in your chair.
[313:54.45]Well, it's because you're bad at games.
[313:58.27]I beat Flame Lurker first try.
[313:59.97]Blind.
[314:00.63]So, I mean... That's fine.
[314:08.24]You can have that opinion if you want, but...
[314:17.23]Flame Lurker isn't hard.
[314:18.85]What the fuck are you talking about?
[314:20.50]You're just peeing in the pool!
[314:35.62]You're just pissed in the pool!
[314:42.69]Is the Dark Souls 3 on stream comment part of banned?
[314:45.05]No, I would never ban that meme because it shows my game skill and I'm not going to make sure, I want to make sure I can say that.
[314:57.19]What about that time I got every single target in the fireworks in point blank one?
[315:01.03]Something that nobody is, that is one of the most impossible tasks.
[315:04.25]I've never even done it when I was younger.
[315:05.41]I mean, what about the fact that I could shoot like 500,000
[315:12.73]Times a second in that game.
[315:14.41]I got my gamer license back then.
[315:27.98]What about the time that I played Winnie the Pooh Home Run Derby and didn't miss one hit?
[315:31.18]I got to level 7 and then my computer broke.
[315:36.56]I actually have a really, really funny gamer license.
[315:41.95]We're gonna save this for another stream.
[315:43.47]Because I actually do have a gamer license, I swear to God.
[315:48.54]I fucking swear to God.
[315:52.58]I won my local blockbuster video game tournament when I was younger, and I actually got a video game license for it.
[316:00.34]I swear to God, and I still have it.
[316:05.16]I was one of those people back in the mid-90s that won that blockbuster video game championship that they had.
[316:12.67]In their hometown.
[316:15.89]Donkey Kong Country was the game that I won.
[316:19.40]Let me think.
[316:20.02]It was Donkey Kong Country.
[316:23.00]There were like four games.
[316:31.89]I can prove it too.
[316:33.49]Swear to God.
[316:34.99]In my wallet.
[316:35.93]Right now.
[316:36.49]Because I was going to make a stupid Twitter joke with it.
[316:38.57]I was going to make a video where you guys were talking about... I think it was after a Dark Souls stream that I did.
[316:45.43]I beat a bunch of bosses in a row and it was like, oh, I was doing really well.
[316:49.32]And I was going to do a Twitter video where I accidentally drop out of my wallet my Blockbuster Championship card.
[316:54.66]And be like, oh, sorry, I'm really terrible at games.
[316:56.38]Let me just get that for a second.
[316:57.30]Oh, what's that?
[316:58.04]Let me stick that back in there.
[317:00.18]It's going to be hilarious.
[317:05.78]I'll show it.
[317:06.68]I will.
[317:09.30]Yeah, it's still in my wallet because I wanted to make that joke like nine months ago and never did.
[317:19.25]It is legit.
[317:19.93]It's laminated.
[317:20.85]It's here.
[317:21.35]It's real.
[317:26.55]So out of all the people here, I'm the only one that actually has and holds...
[317:35.23]a officially licensed game or a license.
[317:37.81]Isn't that odd?
[317:45.54]Alright, fine.
[317:46.22]You guys, guess what?
[317:48.62]This, now, I'll approve it.
[317:50.04]I'll go get it right now.
[317:51.73]You know why?
[317:52.19]Because somebody, everyone's gonna say tomorrow.
[317:55.15]Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[317:56.19]He had time to go to, like, the fucking store and laminate a fake card.
[318:00.02]I'll get it right now.
[318:00.74]Didn't have time.
[318:01.30]I'm sitting here playing Monster Rancher.
[318:02.40]I'll see you in two seconds.
[318:03.56]Just gonna get my wallet.
[318:04.72]Be right back.
[318:29.03]Thank you.
[319:38.79]you
[320:13.67]you
[320:57.11]I got it, I got it.
[320:59.41]I was, I seriously was like, ah, fuck.
[321:00.69]I was like, oh no, I can't, where is it?
[321:04.74]No one's gonna believe me, because I think I just made this up.
[321:07.32]Here it is.
[321:10.36]Forget about the game for a second.
[321:14.26]I can't show you the back, because there's personal information on it.
[321:18.72]But at least I can do this.
[321:20.64]You ready?
[321:29.86]What's that?
[321:31.76]Excuse me.
[321:32.74]What's that?
[321:34.06]Oh, I'm sorry.
[321:35.67]Uh, that's just the, uh, Blockbuster Video Game Championship, uh, official card.
[321:44.33]This is laminated.
[321:45.95]It's real.
[321:47.19]That's real.
[321:51.83]Make the can bigger, sure.
[322:02.51]There it is.
[322:02.97]That's a gamer license.
[322:05.90]And look, I'll show you the back, hold on.
[322:10.20]As store champion, I am entitled to two free video game rentals per month from July 1995 through June 1996.
[322:22.30]Hold on.
[322:31.38]Just make sure it doesn't like show like the town or like my phone number.
[322:39.34]No, okay.
[322:39.80]So here we go, we're good.
[322:41.84]Ready?
[322:42.08]So just make sure that, you know, that's real.
[322:47.81]This shit is real.
[322:48.37]I'm gonna block the personal info.
[322:50.19]Alright, see, ready?
[322:54.33]There it is.
[322:54.97]See?
[322:58.87]That's my name.
[323:05.22]I actually fucking have one.
[323:16.39]Could be any name.
[323:17.67]Give me a break.
[323:20.39]It's just laminated.
[323:26.82]The license is expired?
[323:28.04]Doesn't mean I still own it.
[323:29.40]How do you not change your phone number in over 20 years?
[323:38.76]Those are $50 on eBay?
[323:40.75]Get the fuck out of here.
[323:44.91]This is mine.
[323:46.09]This is my card.
[323:47.23]I fucking won this.
[323:53.26]I earned this.
[323:54.10]I beat people.
[323:54.90]I was like 14 or something.
[323:57.51]I was like 13.
[323:58.47]And I beat people that were like 10 years older than me.
[324:03.27]And I remember one of the guys grabbed me and he pulled me aside.
[324:05.79]He's like, I just want to tell you something.
[324:07.41]You're going places, kid.
[324:09.09]I kicked his ass in Donkey Kong Country.
[324:11.06]He got way more bananas than this loser.
[324:12.48]You know what I mean?
[324:13.38]And he grabbed me.
[324:13.94]He's like, oh, you're definitely going places.
[324:15.26]I'm like, yeah, of course I am.
[324:16.08]And I shoved him out of the way.
[324:19.04]And I grabbed my trophy and I started fucking drinking out of it.
[324:31.21]Yeah, I was 13.
[324:31.67]Well, how old was I?
[324:33.79]Let me see.
[324:34.59]Bananas and don- Yeah, gotta collect the Donkey Kong Country bananas.
[324:37.05]We've collected most of them in a series of five minutes.
[324:42.50]Did you actually win a trophy?
[324:43.50]I did.
[324:44.70]And it's really funny you say that because, oh, you think that's not real.
[324:48.02]I have a fucking trophy at my parents' house that's sitting in a closet somewhere with the same information
[324:59.10]Physical.
[325:00.16]Can you buy those on eBay?
[325:01.62]Don't think so.
[325:11.14]Show it right now.
[325:12.20]I'm not at my parents' house!
[325:15.53]I'm at my goddamn place of residence.
[325:19.63]Yeah, let me drive to my parents' house on stream.
[325:21.55]I'll keep the stream on.
[325:23.21]Hey, uh, Ma, how you doing, Ma?
[325:25.39]It's one o'clock in the morning.
[325:28.29]I'm just coming over because I have to prove to a bunch of people that I won a Blockbuster Video Game Championship when I was, like, 12.
[325:33.96]I mean, that would be pretty good content, I would think, right?
[325:45.69]I'm going to bed.
[325:47.43]Alright, we derailed there.
[325:48.89]We got... Okay, hold on a second.
[325:51.53]Somebody gave a hundred fucking dollars.
[325:53.79]What is going on?
[325:54.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[325:59.16]Nick gave a hundred bucks and just says hello.
[326:12.57]Hello?
[326:13.79]Hello?
[326:14.35]Oh my god.
[326:20.22]That's what we subscribed for?
[326:23.50]Thank you, Nick, for your 200 fucking dollars total.
[326:28.78]Okay, how old was I really?
[326:30.22]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[326:31.64]Nick, this is for you.
[326:32.20]This is going to tell you exactly how old I was.
[326:35.13]This was 1995.
[326:38.31]1995.
[326:38.33]Alright, so I was like fucking nine years old when this happened.
[326:45.65]That would make me like 45.
[326:48.61]I was like 8 or 9.
[326:49.68]Do you understand how fucking impressive that is?
[326:53.76]I won a video game tournament at 8 or 9 years old versus a bunch of college kids.
[327:01.42]I was a gifted student.
[327:03.05]I was extremely talented in the video game sphere.
[327:05.89]That makes me fucking 8 or 9 years old beating Donkey Kong Country Banana Collect-A-Thon versus 25 year olds.
[327:18.06]You peaked at 9.
[327:18.92]You still think I'm a liar, I swear to fucking god.
[327:43.30]I swear to God, and you know what, like, I don't have to prove it to anybody.
[327:47.30]I already know the truth.
[327:53.38]I'm an actual fucking blockbuster video game champion.
[328:00.29]I got free rentals for a year.
[328:04.35]I owned that place for a full year.
[328:07.06]I walked in, everybody knew who I was.
[328:14.58]Alright, anyways.
[328:20.49]Get the tro- I'll get the trophy.
[328:21.71]I'll try to get the trophy for the next- I'm not gonna be able to get it tomorrow.
[328:26.63]I got two free rentals a month.
[328:29.21]That was a huge- when you were- I'm eight, you're nine years old.
[328:32.80]You tell me that's not a gigantic deal?
[328:35.46]To a nine year old?
[328:38.88]How much money do you think I had when I was nine years old?
[328:40.94]I didn't have any fucking money.
[328:44.35]I was happy to get, like, lunch money.
[328:46.81]To buy lunch.
[328:48.21]Maybe, like, three days a week.
[328:49.95]Two days a week.
[328:51.62]Lunch was, like, $1.25.
[328:54.62]Renting a game from Blockbuster was, like, 12 bucks.
[328:59.52]You're telling me that a nine-year-old had a... Let's just use, like, credits.
[329:04.43]Like, store credit income of, like, $25 a month for a nine-year-old.
[329:08.75]That's pretty fucking good.
[329:16.72]It was $5?
[329:17.82]What are you on about?
[329:18.94]It was not $5 to rent a game from Blockbuster.
[329:21.67]It was like $11 or $12.
[329:26.25]With inflation, that's like $75 now.
[329:41.56]And forget about fees.
[329:43.66]Sometimes they'd run a little, they'd run a little, they'd, no, no, you guys are talking about the scam that they used to do.
[329:49.36]And the scam they used to do is you could rent the game for like a day.
[329:53.38]You could rent the game for like two days.
[329:56.44]And then you'd forget about it.
[329:58.58]And you, or you'd want to keep it.
[330:00.42]And you'd pay so many late fees.
[330:03.05]I paid a late fee pretty much every single time.
[330:10.42]You guys talk about the scam deal that they used to run.
[330:15.14]It was like 10 to 15 dollars if you wanted to rent it for more than like four days.
[330:25.63]No wonder it was 12 dollars.
[330:31.95]I would love to spend an entire hour on this topic.
[330:38.40]But for the purposes of, like, I need to go to bed, let's keep going.
[330:41.14]Yeah, we're gonna stream tomorrow.
[330:46.70]Monster Rancher 2 tomorrow as well.
[330:49.34]Same time.
[330:49.68]Alright, so let's go... Where were we here?
[330:57.95]Let's start from right there.
[331:06.25]A lot of people gave a bunch of fucking money while I was gone and ranting.
[331:12.07]Thank you so much, though, for real, Nick.
[331:14.87]For the more than... It's $200 fucking dollars.
[331:18.18]Thank you so much, dude.
[331:21.70]You spoiled the shit out of me.
[331:22.96]Be careful, I might get dotting.
[331:24.32]I might turn dotting.
[331:25.72]If I'm spoiled.
[331:27.82]Thanks a lot, man.
[331:29.88]See, you guys don't know the Blockbuster game.
[331:36.86]The game was, every Blockbuster had their own system of late fees.
[331:40.51]So you would go to, there were like three Blockbusters, four Blockbusters within one or two towns of me.
[331:46.27]So the game, the system would be, rent from a Blockbuster,
[331:50.97]Don't go back to that one for a while because you have late fees there.
[331:53.60]Go to the other blockbuster where you have no late fees and rent from there.
[331:57.64]See, the problem was though, is once you spread yourself out around so many different blockbusters,
[332:02.87]you would forget which one you owed the huge fee to, so what you would do is, oh fuck, uh, is this the Blockbuster that I owe, like, $40 to?
[332:10.07]Nah, I don't think so, I think I owe only, like, a dollar in late fees to this one.
[332:13.76]And you'd drive, you know, a town or two over, and you would go into that Blockbuster thinking you were correct, you'd go up with your, uh, with your Super Nintendo video game under your arm, put it on the desk, they'd scan it, and you'd be sitting there crossing your fingers like, is this the-
[332:28.81]Ah, that'll be $81, and you're like, Ah!
[332:32.49]Fuck!
[332:32.87]And then what are you gonna do?
[332:33.55]You gonna leave?
[332:34.57]You gotta pay it?
[332:35.98]Guys, you gotta be careful when you use the spread.
[332:37.42]Do the blockbuster spread.
[332:38.92]You gotta be careful on that.
[332:47.09]Happened a lot.
[332:50.39]sometimes they would even send you a letter in the mail.
[332:53.55]I don't know if you guys know that, but that was this one.
[332:55.49]You would get a letter in the mail from Blockbuster saying, hey, you know, we haven't seen you in a while, but for John Candy's latest movie that came out, you know, Uncle Buck, you owe us $27 in late fees.
[333:11.74]It's like, yeah, we haven't been there in like three months.
[333:17.24]Oh, fuck, we gotta pay that, huh?
[333:22.23]Sometimes it'd be, it'd be crazy.
[333:24.16]But yeah, yeah, it did happen.
[333:30.34]Anyways, I forget, we keep getting derailed.
[333:35.43]Uh, thank you CMBree for the one dollar.
[333:37.25]It's pronounced doting, you dweeb.
[333:40.29]Ban that guy for life.
[333:43.19]Called me a dweeb.
[333:44.07]For, for life.
[333:57.25]Thank you move means move for the $1 dude, what's a nine-year-old doing here?
[334:04.06]I don't know man, but I feel bad if we actually tried and ended up beating him or Holy shit, the nine-year-old has not lost yet, and he's destroying the score He's killing us in points.
[334:15.58]I'm kind of getting concerned about the nine-year-old now.
[334:17.38]Oh
[334:18.93]And then I have to try.
[334:20.27]And then you're embarrassed because the nine-year-old beat you at a game that you're supposed to be good at.
[334:28.16]Thank you, too.
[334:29.00]Moo means moo for the $1.
[334:30.14]Hitting rock bottom counts as going places, Jerma.
[334:34.30]Thank you.
[334:35.16]Sticks run again thanks to the $1.
[334:36.44]I used to owe Hollywood Video $40 in late fees.
[334:39.67]Then they went out of business.
[334:41.73]Cheer.
[334:43.27]Yeah.
[334:47.68]You know?
[334:49.24]Fuck them.
[334:55.93]You know what I mean?
[334:56.43]Like, what can you say now?
[334:58.67]They didn't adapt.
[334:59.43]You know, as a company, you have to adapt.
[335:03.73]And they didn't.
[335:07.91]Thank you to... Kroden for the $2.
[335:10.51]Mr. H Show...
[335:15.25]Us the trophy on a different stream.
[335:16.79]Yes, I will.
[335:18.73]Thank you, Mr. Krogh.
[335:21.29]Kyra, Toby, thanks for the $1.
[335:22.29]Are you like 75 years old now?
[335:24.21]No, I was nine.
[335:24.81]We figured we corrected the record.
[335:27.55]We struck it from the record and then we corrected that record.
[335:29.90]We made a new record.
[335:33.04]Never trust a purple.
[335:33.70]Thanks for the $5.
[335:34.48]Going places, huh?
[335:35.14]Too bad that didn't stop you from losing to the C-rank monster tournament.
[335:40.76]If I was in there, I would have kicked the shit out of those monsters.
[335:43.18]It wasn't me.
[335:43.74]It was somebody else.
[335:46.14]It was me telling an avatar what to do.
[335:49.08]If I was in that arena and you gave me a samurai sword, oh boy, that fucking spider monster wouldn't have any legs.
[335:58.15]And I would take the prize money.
[336:00.35]Maybe mine.
[336:04.78]But thank you.
[336:08.20]uh sticks renegade again thank you for the one dollar 1996 that's expired you need a renewal away you can't get a renewal blockbuster is f yes they are thank you though thank you kill gannon for the one dollar I apologize for my previous cheer I'm not of sound mind okay well let's see what it was
[336:29.47]Dr. Clay, thanks for the 25 cents.
[336:31.15]My Blockbuster never did anything like that.
[336:32.77]Why was yours so fun?
[336:33.99]Congrats, though.
[336:35.23]Thank you, Dr. Clay.
[336:36.73]Thank you.
[336:37.93]Appreciate that.
[336:41.28]Did they only do that stuff in select locations?
[336:43.94]I'm sure they did.
[336:46.00]Blockbuster was weird, because some Blockbusters weren't owned by Blockbuster.
[336:49.92]They were like franchises, so they didn't run promotions.
[336:52.50]By the way, I hate that shit.
[336:55.32]Have you ever noticed that?
[336:56.60]Sometimes you go through like a drive-thru, like a Dunkin' Donuts or a Wendy's or something, or a Blockbuster, and you pull up at the drive-thru and you order what you want.
[337:04.74]Ah, we don't run that promotion.
[337:07.27]It's like if you're gonna put a TV commercial on TV saying that, hey, this is Dunkin' Donuts, we have the new fucking caramel latte-flavored Dunkuccino, and it's not there at a Dunkin' Donuts, what's the point?
[337:20.57]You know, when you go to the drive-thru and you order the movie from Blockbuster, and they pull up to the window and they hand it to you?
[337:25.36]We don't have that movie right now.
[337:26.78]We're not running that promotion.
[337:28.30]And you're like, give me a fucking break, and you speed off.
[337:34.46]Thank you to Crodon for the $1.
[337:36.34]Subnautica was kind of the same to Chill, but it did have a lot of things to miss.
[337:39.90]And please don't flush me.
[337:46.61]Thank you.
[337:48.50]KXE 501, thanks for the $20.

[337:52.30]Thank you for the large drop of 20 bucks here.

[338:49.70]Is it Funimation?
[338:52.02]Who does that?
[338:53.52]If nobody does that, I'm going to take that.
[338:54.84]I'm going to use that.
[338:55.68]Jerma, you should be watching.
[338:57.07]It is Funimation, yeah.
[339:05.29]So combine NVIDIA and Funimation.
[339:13.65]Thank you to...
[339:15.62]Active Pudding for the $9.

[339:41.33]Can you say my name right as well?
[339:44.40]there sorry sorry uh let's see let's see let's see let's keep going let's keep going let's keep going who do we miss here
[339:57.87]Okay, um... Paper Bowtie, thanks for the $5.
[340:01.45]Appreciate it.
[340:03.11]Kill Ganon, thanks for the $1.25.
[340:04.53]This is what he was talking about.
[340:06.69]Jerma, this game makes me want to bleed my brain out of my eyeballs.
[340:09.56]Please find it in your heart to consider playing a different game next stream.
[340:12.38]I still love you, son.
[340:13.40]Sincerely, Papa.
[340:14.60]Uh-oh, we have a non-believer here.
[340:20.47]In the Monster Rancher cult.
[340:23.77]What do we do?
[340:28.65]Hopefully I've made a believer of a lot of you guys that have never played or seen these games before.
[340:32.29]Fucking Phantom, no.
[340:41.81]Dab on him.
[340:44.87]Thanks, Kilgannon.
[340:45.65]I appreciate it.
[340:46.25]But he did correct the record.
[340:50.36]Why are we in a cult?
[340:51.32]No, just a cult-like mentality.
[340:53.62]A cult-like following.
[340:54.78]You never heard of that term?
[340:55.66]Oh, it's a cult classic.
[341:00.54]That's the term.
[341:01.74]We're not in a cult.
[341:03.23]I'm using the term to reference a small but dedicated fanbase that loves something a lot.
[341:09.29]For instance, um... Monster Hunter.
[341:16.92]Monster Hunter, before this latest generation, was a cult classic video game.
[341:21.14]We had a cult following.
[341:23.00]Wasn't that super popular outside of Japan, right?
[341:31.20]Thank you, though.
[341:33.60]Thank you to Breenland for the $1.
[341:35.56]Jerma, games like these were my childhood.
[341:37.22]Could you hook up... Could you look up a PS1 game called Dragon Seed?
[341:42.32]I have to... Maybe we should do something with the mods.
[341:45.44]Or on the Discord or something.
[341:47.06]Frog in my throat.
[341:49.42]On the Discord, maybe we could get a thing where... We get a good list of PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games.
[341:57.98]Because I've heard a lot, at least two or three suggestions that looked interesting.
[342:02.34]So maybe we could do something like that.
[342:05.84]And I'll take a look at them.
[342:07.73]Because I have it, it's here.
[342:08.91]I have a PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, Dreamcast, I have it all.
[342:12.83]I just need to track down a bunch of games for them.
[342:15.21]Which is what I did for PlayStation 1, and I want to do it for everything else too.
[342:17.96]Should be fun.
[342:21.20]But I definitely will take a look.
[342:23.75]Thank you, Marshmia666 for the $1.
[342:26.27]I love your chat impression.
[342:29.22]Oh, yeah.
[342:29.50]Well, I wasn't doing a chat impression.
[342:30.66]I was just participating in the chat room.
[342:34.60]JakeGames23, thanks for the $1.
[342:36.20]Loving these Monster Rancher streams.
[342:38.20]An absolute classic.
[342:39.02]An oddly entertaining game to watch on Twitch.
[342:41.27]Not nearly as entertaining as the fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled racer known as the one and only Garfield Cart.
[342:50.31]Mm-hmm.
[342:54.14]Are you two working together?
[343:17.10]Right?
[343:17.30]You got Demilkmaster, and then you got JakeGames.
[343:20.32]You both asked for Garfield Kart.
[343:21.65]You guys are in cahoots.
[343:22.89]You guys are colluding with each other.
[343:26.11]You guys are astroturfing the bit comment section here.
[343:32.53]Fine, I'll play it.
[343:36.24]You gotta give me enough five stars, though, for me to understand.
[343:42.00]Thank you for the one dollar, though, dude.
[343:47.99]Wow!
[343:50.79]It's not a snake, it's a controller.
[343:52.40]Easy.
[343:54.68]Uh, thank you to MooMeansMoo for the one dollar.
[343:57.84]Try to make a monster from Smash Mouth's critically acclaimed magnum opus, Fush You Mang.
[344:04.34]I don't know what the fuck that is.
[344:07.02]I think I've only heard three songs from Smash Mouth.
[344:10.15]Ever.
[344:12.33]Hey, now you're an all-star.
[344:14.83]Um...
[344:16.88]Get your shoes on.
[344:18.10]And then what's the one... All-Star, right?
[344:24.90]No, what's the one?
[344:25.48]This is the one from Shrek.
[344:32.98]I think that's all I know.
[344:34.80]Walking on the sun.
[344:35.50]That was the one.
[344:36.40]Get your shoes on.
[344:37.49]That's what I was thinking of.
[344:45.73]KXC501, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[344:49.19]Hey, Jerma, can you turn the music up a bit?
[344:50.62]Chat can't quite hear it properly.
[344:58.08]Thank you for the $10, dude.
[344:59.26]Appreciate it.
[345:00.61]KXC, you're the man.
[345:03.83]Katie4812, thanks for the $5.
[345:06.19]Shotgun blast to abdomen.
[345:09.39]Just pisses Wilford Brimley off more.
[345:14.66]What is that?
[345:15.30]I don't know what that means.
[345:17.26]I don't understand.
[345:18.07]Bobo, thanks for the $10.
[345:20.27]My toilet screams at me.
[345:21.35]I think it's done with my crap.
[345:24.05]But, uh, tis.
[345:25.77]But no, seriously, I probably need to call a plumber.
[345:30.06]You probably should.
[345:30.62]Thanks for the $10, dude.
[345:33.80]Thank you, Samuel Sish, for the $2.
[345:35.10]Sam, thank you.
[345:36.22]When you stream your colonoscopy, overlay the Doctor Who intro credits at the beginning.
[345:43.86]it's just a doctor facecam and he's he's given like strategy so what you want to do here is this is the hard part of the level where when you get to this part uh usually sometimes I rage quit at this part sometimes but as long as you get in there with enough strategy uh you'll be able to get through the boss at the end here it's really really tough though it should we gotta dodge that right there we're gonna get around that
[346:07.34]And then make sure I gotta take a little bit of a sample here with my upgraded plus four biopsy knife.
[346:16.58]Man, that would be a funny fucking video.
[346:17.84]That would be a funny stream, even if it wasn't real.
[346:27.57]Write that shit down.
[346:31.83]Okay, so... Uh...
[346:37.42]Wait, I didn't get it?
[346:38.00]What do you mean, it doesn't get the joke?
[346:45.34]I thought you were saying, put an overlay of the doctor who does the introduction at the beginning.
[346:54.33]When you trim your colonoscopy, overlay the doctor who intro credits at the beginning.
[346:59.93]Holy shit.
[347:01.01]Okay.
[347:01.61]Well, that's a great idea anyways.
[347:06.12]Thanks for the $2.
[347:07.60]Cool beans, yeah, cool beans.
[347:09.48]Harmony Accord, thanks for the $1.
[347:10.74]This clown music's driving me insane.
[347:15.14]Potion Salad, thanks for the $1.
[347:20.64]Defense decreases damage done by Intelligence and Power attacks, but Int and Power give a small bonus to Defense for that same stat.
[347:29.77]Interesting.
[347:31.67]Interesting.
[347:35.31]That's actually really good to know.
[347:36.67]Thanks, dude.
[347:37.25]Thank you, Potion Salad.
[347:38.01]Appreciate it.
[347:40.35]Aretha, thanks for the $1.
[347:41.53]A dab is what they do.
[347:42.67]The dab person with the funny face.
[347:45.17]And Adam, thanks for the 50 cents.
[347:46.43]Hey, you should finish Paw Poo's Home Run Derby.
[347:49.83]You never even got to our Dark Lord and Savior, Christopher Robin.
[347:53.20]I once watched Dark Souls Challenge.
[347:55.38]Runner, fight him for 36 hours straight.
[347:58.51]Aren't they doing a weird, creepy live-action Ewan McGregor is an old Christopher Robin with a weird, dirty Winnie the Pooh live-action Disney movie that they just, for some reason, want to do every movie again as a live-action movie when why the classics exist and they're even better than the live-action ones?
[348:12.25]What's the point?
[348:12.81]Why didn't Beauty and the Beast get made?
[348:14.13]But thank you to Grantif223 for the $2.50.
[348:29.37]Watch out, Jerma.
[348:29.99]Microsoft's name is shooting for your job.
[348:32.27]What?
[348:37.93]How dare you?
[348:38.49]It looks cute.
[348:41.81]Whatever.
[348:42.19]Are you ready?
[348:44.61]I'm going to give you a prediction here.
[348:46.79]Listen up.
[348:49.03]The Christopher Robin Winnie the Pooh movie will have a 58% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[348:59.59]Get it.
[349:00.15]Cap it.
[349:01.89]Save that somewhere.
[349:17.27]It's gonna get like an 87.
[349:18.11]No, it's not.
[349:21.14]It's not.
[349:23.04]What if it's lower?
[349:23.86]No, I think if it's lower, then I still win that.
[349:30.29]IMDB already rated it 66.
[349:32.29]Well, then you know it's gonna be like a 40.
[349:37.63]58.
[349:37.69]I said 58.
[349:40.61]It's gonna come off as really weird and creepy.
[349:45.69]I'm telling you.
[349:46.69]And all the critics are gonna be like, I really wanted to like it, but... Man, it was just... I couldn't do it.
[349:55.84]Somebody said this in the chat too.
[349:56.92]It's just like a PG Ted.
[350:00.51]Yeah.
[350:03.89]It's just Ted, but Ted has a funny voice.
[350:16.08]That's pretty, that's reasonable.
[350:22.18]But thank you.
[350:22.74]Thank you, too.
[350:25.85]Thank you, too.
[350:26.35]Johnny Likes Jam.
[350:30.63]Thank you to D Jack.
[350:33.71]I accidentally donated with just the letter J because I'm an idiot and now I need to spend more money to rectify my mistake.
[350:40.47]Really enjoying the Monster Rancher streams.
[350:41.89]You're the man.
[350:42.37]Lots of love from England.
[350:48.27]With just the letter J. There it is.
[350:50.33]D Jack, thanks for the $1.
[350:52.01]J. There it is.
[350:53.95]I love reading the punchline before I get to actually see what happens.
[351:00.08]Because I'm like, what is he doing with the letter J?
[351:01.74]What is he talking about?
[351:03.08]When I scroll down, it's like, oh.
[351:05.18]That's what he's talking about.
[351:08.71]More Garfield references coming up here.
[351:10.23]GarfieldTheMondayKiller, there he is.
[351:13.49]Guess what, GarfieldTheMondayKiller, you're going to get your wish.
[351:15.83]I don't know if you wished about this too, but I'm going to play Garfield's card on stream.
[351:22.05]Thank you, everybody has a hob.
[351:23.36]No, that's not what, that's what he wrote.
[351:25.80]That's what he wrote.
[351:28.80]Thank you to... Everybody has a hobby.
[351:30.98]No.
[351:32.47]Thank you, GarfieldTheMondayKiller.
[351:35.05]And they say, I'm literally watching ads of Ready Player One and Rampage to continue donating bits.
[351:40.41]The funnies don't pay as much as they used to.
[351:43.19]Anyway, I'm happy to say the thanks to your videos.
[351:44.71]I was able to work up enough confidence to ask the gal I had a crush on out.
[351:48.90]She even took... She even... asked me out to prom because it turned out she liked me too.
[351:57.84]Out of all nine lives, this has got to be the best.
[352:00.84]Thanks for changing my life for the better, Jerma.
[352:02.70]And watch out for Odie.
[352:04.02]He's coming for revenge.
[352:05.12]There's some weird LARPing going on here.
[352:12.57]I love how you're like LARPing and your role playing is Garfield.
[352:17.99]You're keeping the character up.
[352:19.01]I like it.
[352:21.49]Everybody has a hobby, they said.
[352:22.67]Some race cars, some collect art.
[352:24.83]And others play Monster Rancher 2.
[352:28.64]Watch as Beanbag Sonic beat up a sleeping camel.
[352:31.81]Jerma yee-haw.
[352:32.69]Thunderous applause and laughter.
[352:36.59]Go to bed.
[352:37.21]No, I'm not going to bed.
[352:38.87]We are slowly winding down the live stream.
[352:45.12]And I couldn't go over fast enough.
[352:46.80]He was skiing.
[352:49.98]Lorax Brimley was just skiing across the screen.
[352:53.08]With pretend skis.
[352:54.94]You'll see it tomorrow.
[353:01.90]Who else did I miss here?
[353:04.12]This was from a long time ago.
[353:04.96]Once we get through Monster Rancher... Guys, there are a lot of really, really interesting games coming out here soon.
[353:25.93]Speaking of Far Cry, Far Cry 5 comes out soon.
[353:28.50]A Way Out comes out here really soon.
[353:31.32]That's going to be a lot of fun.
[353:32.50]Me and Italic are going to play that in co-op.
[353:37.52]There's quite a few things that are going to have to be put on the back burner.
[353:41.04]Because of all the new games coming up.
[353:45.42]We'll see though.
[353:49.01]Thank you for the two bucks.
[353:51.67]Cheese Eating Brit.
[353:52.99]Thanks for the one dollar.
[353:53.79]Spoiler for the Odyssey.
[353:55.07]Poseidon hates Odysseus.
[353:57.55]Also, why does your blue guy dab whenever he drinks some oil?
[354:01.68]Some almond oil.
[354:03.86]Because that's what he does.
[354:05.76]We just let him do it.
[354:06.62]He just has his fun.
[354:11.34]Thank you, GarfieldTheMondayKiller for the 25 cents.
[354:14.67]Nice Rick and Morty jokes, Jerma.
[354:17.37]Gar... Garzop... Garzopafield.
[354:20.13]Garzobaropafield.
[354:21.47]Sure was a quality joke to come out of that show.
[354:24.17]Garfield Morty sure did make Jim Davis LOL out of his chair, know what I'm saying?
[354:29.47]She just supplied the boss with like five months worth of new comics.
[354:32.45]Thanks for the help and enjoy the... dead Nermal bits.
[354:36.86]What?
[354:42.80]Oh no, it's Gazorpazorpfield.
[354:44.84]Okay.
[354:49.18]Man, everybody, like, hates this show.
[354:53.96]Okay, do anybody have... You know the internet time machine thing?
[354:57.28]Like, the archived internet, like, way back machine?
[355:01.32]Somebody open up, like, the front page of fucking our videos.
[355:06.15]Like, two years ago.
[355:08.53]And go to, like, the Rick and Morty funny... Look at some of the clips that everyone thinks is so funny.
[355:15.83]You know, this... The sentiment has changed.
[355:19.10]so rapidly.
[355:26.10]People were, after the first season of Rick and Morty, holy shit.
[355:30.21]It was like God's gift to the Earth.
[355:33.39]Two more seasons go by, get it off a TV.
[355:48.30]I'm being accused of hating a show I love.
[356:00.49]When they started harassing McDonald's employees, that's when I stopped.
[356:05.39]Terrible fanbase ruining something and running it into the ground.
[356:12.69]The sauce was the turning point, it was.
[356:27.66]I can see it.
[356:28.34]I can see you sending me.
[356:31.50]Anyway, well, let's keep going.
[356:32.98]Only got a few more left here.
[356:35.35]Penny Kettle.
[356:37.31]Thank you for the 60 cents.
[356:38.29]I don't smell any sarcasm in that comment.
[356:39.53]Thank you so much.
[356:53.94]Glad you get it.
[356:55.56]Thank you.
[356:56.66]You have so many laughs and tee-hees here.
[356:58.93]Thank you.
[357:01.39]Super seal.
[357:01.83]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[357:02.57]I don't get embarrassed that much anymore.
[357:03.95]Oh, yeah?
[357:04.29]Then spell eye cup.
[357:08.27]Eye cup.
[357:08.85]Okay.
[357:12.53]I shit in my own sheets.
[357:15.81]And don't change them.
[357:19.71]Thank you DouglasTwice for the fifty... zero... five dollars.
[357:26.96]Thank you, uh, they say, SepticViolent sponsored stream.
[357:35.30]That's not how you spell ICON.
[357:37.70]Uh, thank you, yeah, SepticViolent.
[357:40.54]He can sing, you know.
[357:41.31]You know, he can sing.
[357:45.07]He goes like this every time he sings a song.
[357:54.30]Look up Seth MacFarlane's entire album, and it'll go something like this.
[357:59.04]And that's why I wish I was born in the 40s.
[358:01.74]I belong there.
[358:03.14]There you go.
[358:18.60]Hey, somebody said bye again.
[358:24.64]Remember when he said bye last time?
[358:26.38]Every time I do something stupid, he leaves.
[358:29.68]Target.
[358:30.10]Target's gone again.
[358:35.30]That's the third time that he said bye after I did a terrible thing.
[358:44.53]I fucking love that guy.
[358:48.48]Why do I always see his comment?
[358:52.54]Every fucking time.
[358:54.10]I always see it.
[358:55.08]I always see it.
[359:00.31]I'm getting deja vu.
[359:08.43]I fucking... I love... I love this company.
[359:13.96]Yeah!
[359:15.56]Steve Ballmer.
[359:17.30]This community.
[359:24.57]Anywho, thanks everybody for watching.
[359:28.73]Actually, no, we're not fucking done.
[359:35.51]You can't haha.
[359:37.49]You can't do the cringe haha thing to a guy that was doing an impression of a cringe haha reference of a cringey thing that a guy, a cringey guy did.
[359:48.26]I'm referencing a cringy guy that did a cringy haha thing.
[359:52.36]So therefore, I'm not the one that's at fault there.
[359:56.13]I was referencing it.
[359:57.63]And it had to be somewhat similar.
[360:05.77]Haha.
[360:09.52]Multi-layered haha.
[360:14.08]Anyway, let's get through the next few quickly so I can head to bed here.
[360:16.83]Thank you to Billy Uppercut for the $1.
[360:19.81]See Embry, thanks for the $1.
[360:22.31]Somebody please make a fanfic about Beanbag, Sonic, and Jerma, please.
[360:25.59]Hope not.
[360:26.01]Thank you Hydra725 for the $1.
[360:27.50]Does CBBB mean crispy banana butt butter?
[360:30.72]No, it's... Joe Smoke.
[360:35.14]John Smokes, thanks for the $1.
[360:38.64]Jesus Panini Maker for the $1.
[360:42.95]Where's that one-man twister extravaganza coming soon with the internet?
[360:47.45]Thank you, Super Seal, for the $0.25.
[360:49.05]Fun fact, the glob-gol-gab-golab is actually a metaphor for Christians who are not devout enough to the Lord.
[360:56.38]I don't know if I buy that, but maybe.
[360:58.96]Harmony Accord, thanks for the $1.33.
[361:00.12]It's a PogChamp, but Failfish or BibleThump, maybe DansGame, could be Forehead, Kappa, Ross, Tryhard.

[363:00.98]Hey, Jerma, if you like games that take control away from you, try Majesty.
[363:04.74]You build a town and hire adventurers to complete quests, but they're controlled by the AI.
[363:09.61]That sounds pretty interesting.
[363:11.38]DubskyDude, thanks for the $1.
[363:12.24]You should really consider playing Dragon Warrior Monsters 2, either version.
[363:17.14]It's near and dear to my heart and easily the best monster combining game out there.
[363:20.43]It's Game Boy Color, so not that streamable, unfortunately, but it's very good.
[363:25.71]Love you.
[363:27.11]Thanks for the $1, Dubsky.

[363:58.41]If there was a robot that was allowed to take inputs from chat, and it was able to move its hands around, you guys would hurt me.
[364:04.99]It would be like, move, press, hands, out, straight, is what you guys would write.
[364:09.66]This is what you'd do.
[364:11.58]Move, press, hands, out, straight, is what everybody would fucking spam, and it would be like fucking stabbing me.
