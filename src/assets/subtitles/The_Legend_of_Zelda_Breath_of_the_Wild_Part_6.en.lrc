[00:02.22]So now I'm going to... I'm still alright.
[00:05.88]Let's... I don't know.
[00:07.91]Is my brain capable of even playing Breath of the Wild?
[00:10.83]What is on Switch right now that I can just get?
[00:12.57]That's just simple.
[00:19.38]I feel like it's become very evident on this stream that I am not completely screwed in.
[00:25.02]I feel like I'm playing in somebody else's body.
[00:29.06]You know what I mean?
[00:29.52]Like, I feel like I'm controlling me, like, looking down as a spirit.
[00:34.50]What's, like, simple?
[00:38.56]Play Animal Crossing?
[00:46.11]There's a new monster ranch here.
[00:47.65]Wait, there is, isn't there?
[00:50.05]Hold on, I need to investigate this.
[00:56.89]Let me investigate this.
[01:03.00]Is there really?
[01:03.52]Let's take a look.
[01:11.88]What's the first thing that pops up on the featured page, I wonder?
[01:14.62]It's only on Switch.
[01:21.53]I'm afraid to play a Monster Rancher game because I said that I was going to get guaranteed, no matter what, a monster to S rank in Monster Rancher 1 or 2.
[01:29.32]And I just didn't do it.
[01:32.32]I got to like A and just quit.
[01:36.26]Alright, what have we got?
[01:40.59]It's got to be something that's just completely basic that I can just do.
[01:44.17]Oh, Vinny Raid, what's up?
[01:49.74]Welcome, everybody.
[01:50.26]Thanks, Vinny.
[01:51.72]Thanks for playing.
[01:53.72]Maybe we didn't have the best Splatoon gameplay, but we hung on and we had a good time.
[01:57.91]That's what matters.
[02:00.03]Welcome.
[02:00.91]Alright, so what can I just do?
[02:02.79]Maybe I will just open up Breath of the Wild and just kind of do a shrine or something.
[02:08.07]Yeah, let's just do that.
[02:08.73]That's easy.
[02:16.86]Let's just do that.
[02:26.87]Do the SNES online thing.
[02:29.56]Eh.
[02:35.74]It's this one, right?
[02:41.22]Oh, I don't have to do this anymore.
[02:42.70]I can actually... I can really hear the game.
[02:46.65]You can explore.
[02:47.27]Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
[02:52.53]Thanks for hanging out, everybody.
[02:53.45]Seriously.
[02:54.13]I know that I'm kind of a little fucked up.
[02:58.49]Have COVID if you don't know.
[02:59.43]I'm gonna just say that.
[03:01.91]Because that is what's going on.
[03:06.47]We have to be nice.
[03:11.53]He's sick.
[03:12.21]No, I actually am fine.
[03:13.48]I just feel a little weird.
[03:14.78]Alright, the last thing that I did... Alright, we need to change the title of this stream so it's not like I'm shitting my pants or something.
[03:24.48]How about... I don't know.
[03:25.80]Uh...
[03:27.48]Alright, mods, you have complete creative control.
[03:30.22]As long as there's no swear words.
[03:32.04]You don't talk about, like, how I look like, what my face looks like today.
[03:36.00]Which, by the way, I'm surprised nobody has said anything about, like, the way my... I guess maybe it's not coming up that well, but maybe I have to be bigger on the cam.
[03:45.22]No one's said anything about this today.
[03:47.54]Which is fucking shocking.
[03:50.41]Do you see, like, my facial hair?
[03:58.88]I think people might have just been being nice.
[04:00.34]I literally shaved this part and left everything else.
[04:15.82]I thought it was hilarious, by the way.
[04:17.63]I was talking to Holly and I thought it was the funniest thing ever.
[04:21.23]I was like, oh my God, like I'm going to shave like this part.
[04:28.98]The real reason why, it's not just for like a stupid comedic purpose.
[04:33.82]It was because I haven't, I've been, I've felt sick obviously, so I haven't really shaved in four or five days.
[04:40.15]So, it got really, really itchy and annoying.
[04:42.85]And it's, I don't know, I hate having itchy, annoying hair up here under my nose and above my lip.
[04:48.99]So I just got rid of it.
[04:50.59]And that's the actual reason.
[04:51.75]And then I just like, I kind of didn't care to do the rest.
[04:53.77]I was tired.
[04:54.82]Alright, let's, what are we doing?
[04:57.58]I just upgraded my tablet.
[05:00.42]Let's go... I have access to... I don't think I want to do the big shrine right now.
[05:06.12]I don't know how much more gas I have.
[05:09.45]Rank 2 is over here.
[05:10.23]Let's go ahead and deny that one.
[05:14.95]Okay.
[05:16.75]Oh, actually, that's a good idea.
[05:17.93]I need to turn that off.
[05:19.87]I had to turn it on.
[05:21.17]Hold on.
[05:26.88]How do I do this?
[05:29.54]Oh, here it is.
[05:29.94]Okay.
[05:31.72]What do you mean deface?
[05:35.94]I mean, that was a little mean.
[05:36.94]Again, that was a little mean.
[05:39.40]What do you want me to say?
[05:40.06]Alright, I'm not going to turn this off.
[05:47.72]Okay, there we go.
[05:53.14]Why are you defacing me?
[05:58.65]Yeah, there's this, which is the area with the big divine beast, right?
[06:06.86]Not ready for that one.
[06:07.64]What I am ready for is I think maybe a little bit of exploration to the left here.
[06:11.26]Does that make sense?
[06:16.80]I'm going to go to the left here.
[06:18.31]I want to check it out.
[06:27.92]He wanted to be your friend.
[06:32.78]I don't, but I, I, I can't.
[06:37.38]When are you going to do a full playthrough?
[06:39.00]Breath of the Wild is a fun game just to just play it every now and again for a few hours.
[06:44.72]It's a great game just to be like, alright, what else am I doing today?
[06:47.14]This, I'll do this.
[06:47.86]Alright.
[06:51.53]So I'm looking for shrines because I'm a shrine Andy.
[06:58.16]So I need to go, I'm going to go over here.
[07:04.78]And what's that?
[07:07.48]Shrine just ahead.
[07:08.58]There's one there.
[07:09.84]It's the only one I can see.
[07:14.09]Alright, we're going to go straight ahead here.
[07:15.41]I should probably mark it.
[07:20.51]Oh, wait, I can just take the zoom in thing.
[07:24.71]There we go.
[07:28.12]How do you zoom in?
[07:29.04]Oops.
[07:32.24]I saved it!
[07:36.42]It's over here somewhere.
[07:42.34]This is interesting.
[07:42.90]What's going on here?
[07:45.68]That was with a pixel to spare.
[07:47.74]To not die.
[07:53.07]Yeah, again, I wanted to be live today, too, so I could warn everybody that tomorrow is the Susguy stream where the entire channel is going to be rebranded.
[08:04.26]You are not going to even recognize this place tomorrow.
[08:08.16]So, the Susguy is finally going to play Among Us.
[08:13.63]And I'm fucking leaning into it as hard as I can.
[08:17.74]Alright, so I upgraded the stasis, didn't I?
[08:21.52]So what does this, what's the upgraded stasis do?
[08:24.30]What does it let me do now?
[08:30.47]Probably something, right?
[08:33.87]Put this on.
[08:34.39]This thing's damaged already.
[08:36.85]It didn't even fucking do anything.
[08:40.47]It can freeze enemies now?
[08:41.97]Let's try it.
[08:49.74]so this will do all the damage alright that's pretty huge that's awesome I've never actually done that before alright trying I'm gonna have to get rid of this weapon it's gonna be damaged
[09:17.13]Where was it?
[09:21.53]It's like this way, right?
[09:23.07]Am I going the right way?
[09:26.06]What time is the sus guy stream?
[09:27.96]Now that is a good question.
[09:33.20]Is it right here?
[09:33.78]I already did that one.
[09:35.64]To the left?
[09:41.33]Why did I have to fall off?
[09:47.27]What time?
[09:49.21]I don't know.
[09:49.67]Just look for it.
[09:51.07]You're not going to be able to miss it.
[09:52.35]I'm telling you.
[09:52.85]There's going to be... There's going to be like a hundred billion people watching that stream.
[09:58.98]You understand?
[09:59.64]You'll be able to find it.
[10:05.97]Now this is so funny to me because if that stream is like wicked shit viewership, it's going to be even funnier.
[10:13.83]So I'm prepared either way for this to be a win no matter what.
[10:19.62]Because that's funny.
[10:23.04]Like if like nobody shows up to that stream tomorrow and I do all this rebranding and I do this big, oh, I'm like selling out for the sus guy joke.
[10:31.82]That's funny.
[10:35.57]I just got a fairy?
[10:39.84]What?
[10:41.78]That's a revive?
[10:48.36]Okay.
[10:49.14]I need to go this way.
[10:49.86]Is the horse anywhere near me?
[10:54.85]No.
[10:57.47]You can eat?
[10:58.47]No, you can't.
[10:59.17]Can you?
[11:07.88]You can get more.
[11:08.62]That's pretty cool.
[11:11.61]I didn't even know they existed.
[11:16.47]The shrine is between the tower and the distance here.
[11:20.43]Is it this far away?
[11:22.37]If I could have glided and not fallen down.
[11:25.19]I have the shrine thing set to on, right?
[11:36.76]Cut the grass?
[11:41.85]Wait, they're in the grass.
[11:45.97]That's cool.
[11:51.19]Oh, watch out, Ganon.
[11:54.91]There it is.
[11:55.39]Ooh, this smells weird.
[12:01.61]It's like a dragon head.
[12:03.61]Do you guys see?
[12:15.00]Oh wait, this is the... Oh, okay.
[12:24.18]So I get the horse back here.
[12:25.98]Uh, let me take an inventory here.
[12:28.08]I have a lot of shit.
[12:31.84]Maybe do some cooking?
[12:36.96]Eh, I got plenty of apples.
[12:39.28]Um, eh.
[12:42.78]Greetings, traveler.
[12:43.40]How about a song?
[12:45.52]That there are... I thought he was singing.
[12:48.42]I'm sorry.
[12:48.96]It's nothing.
[12:49.56]I don't mean to pry.
[12:50.86]Pry about what?
[12:56.49]Are you... Have you never met a Rito before?
[12:59.21]Odd.
[13:00.93]My name is Kas.
[13:01.79]As a bard, I spend my days traveling this land in search of ancient songs.
[13:05.13]Have you heard of the ancient songs?
[13:07.78]No.
[13:09.54]Ancient songs.
[13:10.08]Songs that sing the praises of a hero who beat back the calamity in an age past.
[13:15.88]One of the more famous among them recounts the events of 10,000 years ago.
[13:20.87]I happen to know a song about the ancient hero who was passed down to me.
[13:23.55]Do you want to hear it?
[13:24.55]Yes.
[13:25.43]Please do.
[13:27.25]How is it?
[13:28.29]Here we go.
[13:40.94]Should I sing this part?
[13:42.06]A dark...
[13:45.18]I don't feel well enough to do this.
[13:48.24]Hope survives in Hyrule.
[13:50.74]I don't care.
[13:54.97]He's supposed to be singing, not me.
[13:56.29]It's supposed to be his song.
[14:02.05]Just read it.
[14:07.11]Dude, you... Somebody said, dude, you have an iron deficiency?
[14:10.19]No, I have COVID right now.
[14:12.51]I don't have an iron deficiency.
[14:19.47]He's lazy.
[14:20.23]No, I'm not.
[14:20.93]My iron's fine.
[14:21.55]I don't know the beat.
[14:23.33]I can't even hear the music.
[14:41.14]began and lurked beneath the surface.
[14:44.28]Strengthening its jaws, so the ancient people of Hyrule said to help cause... This is not even a song!
[14:49.66]Death its bore fruit in an automated force, to help avert calamity by sealing it at its source.
[15:00.80]For giant behemoths, for which the power never ceased, each of these titans was called a divine beast.
[15:09.51]It's not a Disney movie.
[15:11.08]Well, how do you know that?
[15:22.14]There's no lyrics here.
[15:32.18]You sound like Steve from American Dad.
[15:38.75]Yeah, that voice actor is an incredibly talented singer, by the way, if you didn't know.
[15:47.27]And when... I don't know.
[15:51.34]I took too much fucking cold medicine for this one.
[16:06.69]So this is the original game for the regular Nintendo.
[16:12.07]Wait, that wasn't 10 years ago.
[16:13.11]This is what, Twilight Princess?
[16:28.55]No, you're a fake fan.
[16:30.01]I don't play Zelda games.
[16:31.29]Yeah, that's correct.
[16:39.08]I think I heard this music, and it just made me think, oh, that's old Zelda stuff.
[16:50.22]Thanks for listening.
[16:50.73]Please come back and hear it again sometime.
[16:53.39]Hold on, I gotta replace this.
[16:54.93]Give me one sec.
[16:58.81]It is the original game, yes.
[17:00.17]Well, I think you're one of the only people that said that.
[17:04.14]But I appreciate it, though.
[17:07.62]Hold on, let me plug this in.
[17:09.74]I'm plugging in different headphones.
[17:15.16]It's not a song.
[17:15.88]It's more like an old proverb.
[17:20.92]Alright, but he said he was going to sing.
[17:22.02]He has an accordion.
[17:23.70]Hold on.
[17:35.93]Ouch.
[17:37.85]Ouch.
[17:42.56]ow you ever put too much weight down on your elbow weird like weirdly enough you put you put your elbow down to brace yourself or something and you put a little just somehow too much weight and it's just this insane pain just whoa but other times you'll put the exact same spot it won't hurt at all okay well that's cool pretty cool lore
[18:08.93]Shrine time.
[18:09.37]I'll show you how it's done.
[18:13.49]Missed every single swing and I didn't do that on purpose.
[18:29.22]Is this a combat shrine or a puzzle shrine?
[18:30.82]Let's find out.
[18:41.41]Time for a chat mute.
[18:42.45]Yeah, go ahead and do it.
[18:54.58]Alright, it is.
[18:57.46]Shields from water.
[19:01.52]OK, shields from water.
[19:03.90]I'm going to assume this is we're going to do this.
[19:07.57]Freezing here.
[19:08.23]Do I die in this water?
[19:12.60]Oh, okay.
[19:16.86]I gotta stop the flow of water.
[19:21.16]Actually, this is a current here.
[19:22.36]I don't even know how you even do that.
[19:33.49]Like, you know what?
[19:35.03]Alright.
[19:35.89]Sprint being X and jump being B. It's kind of weird.
[19:43.63]Alright, does this do anything?
[19:47.59]Block the water?
[19:55.42]Wait a minute, it can't... Ah, look at that.
[19:58.24]Didn't take me any time at all.
[20:01.74]Really?
[20:20.13]What?
[20:29.42]Is this not high enough?
[20:33.26]Oh, okay.
[20:36.06]Watch out, laser!
[20:44.82]Okay.
[20:51.14]Let's try this.
[20:52.34]No, not stop time.
[20:53.12]I can pull it out, right?
[20:55.72]Ah.
[20:56.60]Alright, so there's a chest trust over there.
[20:58.36]Oh, I know.
[21:03.07]I already got it.
[21:03.53]You don't even need to help me.
[21:08.81]If I need help, you know how I'm going to ask for it.
[21:10.67]You better believe it.
[21:17.35]What's in here?
[21:21.44]Ancient Core.
[21:22.44]Pretty good.
[21:23.02]Sorry, I gotta get it.
[21:33.28]This one doesn't seem very hard.
[21:35.16]This one seems just pretty good.
[21:36.79]You know what I mean?
[21:42.87]Ancient Screw.
[21:43.59]I just got that for free.
[21:46.23]Alright, hold on.
[21:46.75]Let me... I need...
[21:50.22]I don't want to use these arrows.
[21:52.25]Where did I get 41 ice arrows?
[21:54.31]Are you serious?
[21:55.05]Okay, well, I'm going to use it.
[21:59.94]And let's just use the knight's bow.
[22:21.87]Okay.
[22:22.87]Should I play The Sims 4?
[22:24.23]Like, just get all the expansions and just play it?
[22:30.42]What the fuck?
[22:31.04]Get up!
[22:33.82]Stop!
[22:34.62]How do I get up?
[22:39.64]I thought I was gonna miss it.
[22:40.68]Whatever.
[22:41.10]It's fine.
[22:42.98]I got dragged over.
[22:47.73]At least I can see what I need to do.
[22:48.75]I'm gonna have to block it, right?
[22:51.01]Whoa, that was cool.
[22:53.00]Okay.
[22:56.06]I definitely have to block it from going over.
[22:57.52]Okay.
[23:16.13]How do I get that one?
[23:29.75]No.
[23:31.17]Wait.
[23:32.13]I know what to do.
[23:35.61]Right?
[23:38.14]Yeah.
[23:45.98]Knight's broadsword.
[23:47.30]I'm going to run into one of the wood ones.
[23:52.72]Okay.
[24:00.55]Okay, so what happens over here?
[24:01.89]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[24:05.69]Get it.
[24:05.95]Grab it.
[24:06.23]Grab it.
[24:07.27]Grab it.
[24:12.42]I'm dead.
[24:27.15]The current is going to pull you.
[24:28.61]Alright, so I just have to get to the raft.
[24:36.60]Now this is where I'm going to have a little bit of trouble, I think.
[24:41.96]So I have to get rid of all this.
[24:48.43]Can I move this with the... No, this is made of wood.
[24:51.73]What do I do?
[25:05.07]I turned into a fucking McRib.
[25:06.45]It's fine.
[25:07.77]Oh my god.
[25:08.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[25:09.21]Don't.
[25:09.61]That's okay.
[25:10.13]I'm dead.
[25:13.09]I have to get on top of this.
[25:19.11]That just spawned and I wasn't even ready.
[25:21.41]Is another one going to come?
[25:33.69]Okay, so I have to block it right at the end here.
[25:38.09]Oh, shit.
[25:44.61]Easy.
[25:51.41]Got it.
[26:18.26]Spirit orb.
[26:25.68]What are your pajamas on?
[26:27.22]This is a Marvel shirt.
[26:30.38]This is not... I have four now.
[26:34.54]I can do another upgrade.
[26:37.62]Explain the McRib joke.
[26:38.86]It looked like a McRib when it was upside down.
[26:42.61]Explain it.
[26:43.09]How?
[26:44.37]You're a nerd.
[26:55.72]Go back and look.
[26:56.30]It looked like a McRib sandwich.
[26:57.50]Alright, I got four orbs.
[27:03.18]Let me get the horse back.
[27:06.99]And from here... Alright, I gotta... Ooh, there's a bridge right here.
[27:11.55]Alright.
[27:13.29]I'm gonna go to the bridge and go left.
[27:15.63]That's the plan.
[27:17.45]I like exploring.
[27:18.17]This is on Switch or PC.
[27:25.02]Um...
[27:33.06]I want Frank 2.
[27:33.66]What is it on Switch?
[27:39.00]You can't get it for anything else.
[27:50.50]Alright, Frank 2.
[27:51.06]How am I doing on it?
[27:54.16]I think I'm doing okay on food, right?
[27:59.64]I've got a lot of food that I never ate.
[28:02.71]I spent, like, 45 minutes cooking all this stuff before.
[28:06.84]And then, like, turned the stream off.
[28:08.70]Wait, I have those truffles.
[28:09.62]I don't think I need them yet.
[28:13.54]Let's keep exploring.
[28:23.06]Buy arrows?
[28:24.30]Oh!
[28:25.10]Thank you.
[28:28.88]Where is... Where is he?
[28:37.96]Where's the guy with the big sack on his back?
[28:44.17]He's inside, okay.
[28:50.40]Look at this dog.
[28:51.48]Cool.
[28:53.52]Alright.
[28:57.44]I want to buy.
[29:00.49]Yeah, but should I play The Sims 4?
[29:01.87]You know what?
[29:02.57]After VR, after like the two or three days in VR, we're just doing a fucking brand new Sims 4 Insanity Day.
[29:14.04]Uh, oh, I need, give me all of these.
[29:16.62]This is so cheap.
[29:21.66]Wait a minute.
[29:23.04]Am I getting scammed?
[29:23.64]Five in bulk, right?
[29:26.98]6, 12, 18, 20... 6, 12, 18, 24, 32.
[29:31.49]You save a little bit of money.
[29:35.81]But I'm going to buy 20 of these.
[29:36.73]What is this?
[29:44.68]Oh, hot-footed frog.
[29:49.60]Max stamina.
[29:51.76]Should I just buy everything?
[29:54.66]These are only 10 cents.
[30:00.66]These are cheap.
[30:01.92]I'll take them.
[30:05.70]Are these worth it?
[30:11.74]I mean, if I got money.
[30:15.12]I'll take them all.
[30:18.16]No.
[30:18.72]Okay.
[30:23.51]No, no, no, no.
[30:24.45]They're easy to go catch.
[30:25.37]Okay.
[30:27.19]Go catch them.
[30:27.65]They're free.
[30:32.17]Oh, I thought it was the dog for a second.
[30:37.25]I was like, wait.
[30:43.38]I know.
[30:43.84]No, I don't want to hear that song again.
[30:45.12]It was a good song, but I don't we don't need to hear it again.
[30:47.04]Alright, let's go.
[30:49.34]I'm for exploring.
[30:57.19]What was the thing that people said that it just the horse automatically goes on the road if I press something?
[31:01.59]What is it?
[31:01.99]Alright.
[31:17.13]How do we save this person?
[31:20.55]You press Z L L. Okay.
[31:25.45]Are you okay?
[31:28.13]Look who's here.
[31:28.73]The guy that stood around and watched me get beat up.
[31:30.80]A little help next time.
[31:36.96]Okay.
[31:41.68]That's what I just did, isn't it?
[31:42.88]Alright, let's put that night... No, keep this one on.
[31:51.71]So if I get closer to the Calamity Ganon castle, is that some bad gonna happen?
[32:05.73]Just don't press anything.
[32:06.65]Okay.
[32:09.62]What does that mean?
[32:42.45]I'm not going to that castle.
[32:43.49]Let's go over to that tower.
[32:46.63]This way.
[32:49.43]Alright.
[32:54.79]There's a lot of towers over here.
[33:03.62]Can I fight this thing?
[33:05.44]Oh my god, there's like more than one.
[33:18.89]Can't do it when I'm on a horse, can you?
[33:20.91]Oh shit, multiple people shooting sniper rifles at me.
[33:47.07]Fuck!
[33:47.73]Is he okay?
[33:48.76]What happened?
[33:49.28]Oh my god!
[33:53.00]Why is this like... Level 100 zone?
[33:56.34]What is going on?
[33:57.32]Why am I still alive?
[34:00.98]What's happening?
[34:04.06]Excuse me?
[34:04.76]Help!
[34:08.34]Help!
[34:13.80]Why am I stuck?
[34:18.08]Get up!
[34:29.94]Yeah, fuck you.
[34:34.33]Climb a tree, climb a tree, climb a tree.
[34:37.27]Climb a tree, climb a tree quick, just like a fucking animal.
[34:42.13]It's raining, you stupid game.
[34:54.01]shoot each other I just have to get over there dude come on what keeps refilling my health I did although with fairies oh I don't know I can't go over there there's like alright I don't know what was going on over there
[35:26.60]So I didn't know I was going to go into, like, the part of the game where I'm not allowed to be, and I'm going to get warnings on my screen.
[35:32.12]Like, you're leaving the game area.
[35:33.40]Warning, you're leaving the game area.
[35:34.84]Okay, well, we... I can't... I'm not going this way again.
[35:46.31]I'm going somewhere else.
[35:47.81]Where should I go?
[35:48.51]It's not possible?
[35:50.52]Alright, well, then I'm going to go... I'm going somewhere else.
[35:58.17]Go south, then west.
[36:04.53]Like down here?
[36:05.09]You need to learn how to parry.
[36:11.73]You're just too low level right now.
[36:19.62]I'll go this way.
[36:30.41]You guys also have to remember that I haven't played this game in like two or three weeks.
[36:33.85]I don't know where I'm supposed to be going.
[36:45.13]Alright.
[36:45.39]I'm going to say if this is like too high and too hard.
[36:48.51]Did you say rip?
[36:49.55]I'm going to go this way.
[36:52.27]Let's just bang a left.
[36:54.99]It's cold here, but that's alright.
[36:56.29]I have cold gear, don't I?
[37:01.84]Now that's swim speed.
[37:02.78]I don't have any cold gear.
[37:03.82]I have fire gear.
[37:12.11]What about the Divine Beast?
[37:14.87]I feel like I was right about to do it.
[37:28.12]The one in the mountain.
[37:28.92]Yeah, I'm going to go there.
[37:29.92]I feel like I was about to start doing that.
[37:32.10]Yeah, I'll do that instead.
[37:35.67]That was up here, right?
[37:38.01]I remember there was a mine cart.
[37:43.35]How come I can't?
[37:43.91]I need to get a tower here.
[38:04.43]Was that... It's just a green tea.
[38:08.46]Get the tower first.
[38:09.12]Yeah, I'm gonna just find the tower first.
[38:17.50]Alright, this is... I just wanted to get over here and just see.
[38:21.03]This is definitely not the right place to be, but I'm in... Oh, my shit's burning.
[38:26.79]You know what?
[38:27.07]I don't fucking want it anyways.
[38:29.59]Okay.
[38:31.51]So...
[38:34.83]That is a tower that way.
[38:37.65]Which I think this is closer to the tower.
[38:40.07]Why don't you throw the good sword?
[38:58.43]It was about to break.
[39:01.37]That sword actually was about to break.
[39:04.40]This is where the minecart is.
[39:05.68]Alright, hold on.
[39:06.30]Let me try to remember something from a month ago.
[39:14.83]I'm going to go high, right?
[39:17.19]And look over here.
[39:17.81]Because I can actually see what the fuck I'm looking at.
[39:37.74]Use first person?
[39:40.42]I will.
[39:44.69]Alright.
[39:45.55]Let's take a good look.
[39:49.55]So, I need to look over here.
[39:51.81]There is the tower right there.
[39:56.30]Stamp it.
[39:58.14]That's not A. God damn it.
[40:02.14]Okay.
[40:05.46]Okay.
[40:07.72]Is there anything else here too?
[40:13.34]No, that's definitely where I want to be.
[40:16.09]Alright, can I just float over there?
[40:18.37]We're going for it.
[40:20.71]You got that shirt at Walmart.
[40:23.01]You don't need to concern yourself where I get my t-shirts, okay?
[40:26.27]You don't need to concern yourself where I get my t-shirts.
[40:29.31]It doesn't matter.
[40:29.75]Did I get it from Target?
[40:30.49]Walmart?
[40:30.97]Did I get it from... Am I dying?
[40:40.66]Why am I down?
[40:41.15]I'm getting hurt.
[41:31.95]It's not that much.
[41:45.60]Okay, well... I can just climb, it's fine.
[41:52.73]It's not raining, I can get up here.
[41:54.75]Oh my god, why is it raining?!
[41:56.99]It's not even raining on the weather forecast!
[42:03.63]It just rained in one spot for one second?
[42:05.57]Alright, we're good.
[42:18.76]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[42:25.98]Please, please, please!
[42:26.87]People are gonna make fun of me!
[42:45.14]Oh, nice.
[42:45.60]Good.
[42:46.62]Okay, this will do it.
[43:00.27]Okay.
[43:02.61]There it is.
[43:05.45]I'm good.
[43:08.26]Broad sword.
[43:08.80]Let's get it.
[43:14.20]This is pretty.
[43:19.71]Thank God Frank, too, is okay.
[43:21.19]Yeah, he took a explosive sniper rifle bullet right to his side.
[43:26.17]Equip a shield?
[43:29.00]Oh, I don't know how to have a shield on.
[43:31.90]You're right.
[43:32.66]That's weird.
[43:39.21]What is this?
[43:54.41]Do I have to match that thing?
[43:55.43]I have to match this.
[43:57.05]Okay.
[43:58.67]So it's... Put this down.
[44:00.25]Let me go look at this.
[44:04.44]It's like a... It's like a Tetris piece.
[44:08.72]So it's one on the top.
[44:10.84]So it's one, two, three, four.
[44:13.48]One, two, three.
[44:14.84]One, two, three.
[44:15.70]One, two.
[44:16.38]One, two, three, four.
[44:17.40]One, two, three.
[44:18.14]One... I forgot.
[44:19.06]One, two, three.
[44:20.53]One, two, three, four.
[44:23.29]One, two, three, four.
[44:25.42]one two three one two three two one two three four this is not right um I have to do this okay I had it in reverse like this
[44:57.94]Everybody talks shit about me when I couldn't do this the last time, and it's probably a different puzzle.
[45:03.12]I probably don't have to match these.
[45:08.94]Or do I?
[45:14.41]One piece just sticks out in the back.
[45:18.39]You just put it in.
[45:23.79]It wouldn't fit in.
[45:24.29]I mean, like, right here.
[45:30.99]I don't think I can do that.
[45:31.77]I can't believe this.
[45:36.11]Because everybody fucking said last time too.
[45:41.48]Am I supposed to be matching it?
[45:42.70]Is that what I'm actually supposed to be doing?
[45:43.80]There's two sticking out on this side.
[45:49.14]One on this side.
[45:50.02]One on this side.
[45:50.66]And then three on the back.
[45:58.41]So it's got to go over here.
[46:08.06]I didn't know if... I thought people may have been fucking with me.
[46:28.11]Cool.
[46:30.98]How did that take 24 minutes?
[46:31.86]It took like three.
[46:33.90]And that person for an hour.
[46:43.45]Ugh, it's in my eye.
[46:48.97]Ooh, this is like steamy.
[46:50.09]Okay.
[46:50.37]Should I just go up the front door here?
[46:53.71]Where the path is?
[46:54.27]This seems like the right idea.
[47:05.13]Are the chocobos hostile or no?
[47:08.04]They don't look it.
[47:13.96]God damn it.
[47:30.34]Overshot it.
[47:40.61]Fucking piece of shit.
[47:41.99]You thought you were gonna get me with that?
[47:43.67]Nope.
[47:44.47]Sorry.
[48:07.36]I gotta watch my health.
[48:14.42]Who is doing that, by the way?
[48:15.44]A chest?
[48:20.18]Oh my god, there's a chest here.
[48:27.02]What is going- Why did I climb up a fucking mountain?
[48:30.48]I'm so angry.
[48:31.16]Hold on.
[48:32.90]I tried to turn around.
[48:37.59]Ooh.
[48:39.73]Nice.
[48:41.47]I need to eat something before I die.
[48:45.47]Just something, something tasty.
[48:46.93]Something that's not going to do anything crazy, right?
[48:49.71]Um.
[48:57.11]How about this?
[48:57.47]How about just a few apples?
[49:03.79]I don't need, whatever.
[49:04.33]I don't want to waste food.
[49:16.68]Are you guarding something?
[49:18.26]Alright, let's move.
[49:27.72]You motherfucker.
[49:42.88]trying really what's this oh goodness I'm eating some something better than that yeah let's just go with a fried wild greens let's go give me more health
[50:21.14]Don't go chasing.
[50:21.96]He's dead.
[50:26.44]What are you guys guarding over here?
[50:41.46]Ooh, what's this?
[50:54.14]I'm gonna blow this shit up.
[50:58.47]I'll take them.
[50:59.31]That's good.
[51:07.86]What is that?
[51:12.03]Crab?
[51:25.54]Is there anything even in that?
[51:34.05]Roasted bass.
[51:34.73]This is food, so this is good.
[51:37.87]Okay.
[51:40.61]More food?
[51:44.09]I'll take it.
[51:59.26]Pick up the boxes and drop them to break them.
[52:00.75]I'll remember that for next time.
[52:11.63]Very cool.
[52:11.95]Alright, almost there.
[52:14.49]It's right up here, right?
[52:17.87]Is this a shrine?
[52:18.53]Which I'm... That's my favorite.
[52:41.02]What was that?
[52:42.08]Are they on fire?
[52:42.76]Okay.
[52:45.72]Still have COVID?
[52:46.36]Yes, I do.
[52:48.58]I do.
[52:51.78]It's pretty mild, but still sucks.
[52:55.85]It's sort of right in the middle of it right now.
[53:00.75]Did I get this one?
[53:01.69]No.
[53:03.17]Let me go up a little higher.
[53:11.96]Yeah, I have my sense of taste, my sense of smell.
[53:14.54]It's all there.
[53:15.26]I'm just really raspy and congested.
[53:18.60]And it kind of just feels like I like get my face punched.
[53:26.26]I just feel like kind of sloppy.
[53:32.81]Okay, can I jump?
[53:33.79]I think I can jump over this, right?
[53:36.13]With the... Can I not?
[53:42.55]Elden Tower.
[53:47.43]I think I can make it.
[53:59.54]Just got COVID myself.
[54:07.93]Definitely not a fun experience.
[54:10.92]I just hope it goes away soon.
[54:13.70]Because I know that COVID has a tendency to linger.
[54:18.80]Which, not looking forward to that if that's the case.
[54:23.53]I am fortunate enough where I have a very mild case of it so far.
[54:26.85]Where I obviously don't want to, you know, knock on wood.
[54:32.19]But it's pretty mild.
[54:40.78]Cool.
[54:41.28]Alright.
[54:42.54]Let's actually see what we're doing here.
[54:49.46]Don't push yourself.
[54:50.46]No, I'm good.
[54:52.60]I wouldn't be live right now if I didn't think I could be for at least a few hours or so.
[54:55.94]I mean, it might be a little sloppy today, but, you know, let's be honest, is that really any different?
[55:07.34]What's that?
[55:18.72]Your voice sounds better than last stream?
[55:22.66]Probably.
[55:23.04]Although I have been taking this... ...pilot all cold, kind of, whatever, max... ...maximum cold strength.
[55:36.01]Cool.
[55:37.86]Okay.
[55:46.02]Now I can actually see what I'm doing.
[55:48.76]so important this is where's the the beast is up here let me go to actually let me go here destroy ganon the hero sword free divine beast okay this is the one
[56:08.62]Ludo, thank you for helping Unobo after taking the painkillers.
[56:12.82]Ludo was about to go challenge Divine Beast Varudania, but then his back started hurting again.
[56:17.46]No one will be challenging the Divine Beast today, it seems.
[56:20.62]Okay, meet him there.
[56:24.06]Okay, this is where we need to go.
[56:25.78]This is what we were doing before.
[56:27.96]And it's right here.
[56:32.13]Cool.
[56:35.87]Let's go.
[56:44.33]Yeah, I've been taking NyQuil, too, in the evening hours.
[56:47.33]Because the thing about taking NyQuil is it makes you just feel like you're on another planet sometimes.
[56:53.97]Especially if you do it a couple days in a row.
[56:55.65]I always try to space out stuff like NyQuil.
[57:09.30]Gotta be careful with drugs like NyQuil.
[57:11.98]It works, right?
[57:13.18]Stuff like NyQuil is... Oh man, it works.
[57:19.41]But you just gotta be careful with that shit.
[57:21.85]Alright, so let's do it.
[57:29.56]What's this gem?
[57:34.04]Am I ready to do this?
[57:35.16]I mean, if there's ever a time to do it, I'm ready to go.
[57:43.80]Jesus.
[57:47.36]You think I'm ready?
[57:47.90]For a divine beast too?
[57:49.87]Let's find out.
[57:55.63]Help me!
[57:56.75]No, it's not even a cutscene.
[58:00.85]You have to taste your own medicine.
[58:06.87]Fire.
[58:20.66]Really?
[58:25.35]Swing!
[58:25.73]Alright, I am out of just basic shit weapons.
[58:35.85]What should I use?
[58:36.57]I'm afraid to use anything.
[58:37.65]This is all, this is all like collectibles.
[58:40.73]I don't want to take my collectibles out of the saran wrap.
[58:43.13]You know what I mean?
[58:44.13]I don't want to take them out of the plastic.
[58:45.93]What should I use?
[58:52.11]Just use them.
[58:53.56]I know, but they'll be ruined if I use them.
[58:54.88]I don't want to take them out of the plastic.
[58:56.14]I'm going to use the lino sword.
[59:06.67]The trident can't be replaced.
[59:10.70]Alright.
[59:27.17]Oh, thank God.
[59:27.81]A shit weapon that I can take out of the plastic.
[59:35.68]I just took this thing out of the box, took the plastic off, and freaked out and tried to put the plastic back on.
[59:46.27]Alright, you good?
[59:52.30]Oops.
[59:53.76]What?
[59:54.02]Use ice arrows?
[59:54.78]What are you, a dope?
[59:55.92]Really?
[59:56.34]I tried to press the other B button.
[60:11.55]Yeah, the other B button.
[60:25.98]Wow, you're crazy strong.
[60:27.26]Goro, you saved me.
[60:28.32]Are we going to do the Divine Beast together?
[60:32.91]Oh.
[60:37.18]you guys understand I just put fingerprints on that sword and just reduced its value by like 50 percent it's true not coming but why his back hurts okay if boss can't help there's nothing else we can do I suppose I'll just head back now
[61:05.63]Please replace all the Gorohs with Goku.
[61:07.53]That's right.
[61:11.39]You're not going back, but why, Goku?
[61:13.55]What?
[61:14.07]You're going to try to board the Divine Beast?
[61:18.99]Why do you think you are?
[61:20.25]What do you think you are, Lord Durek?
[61:21.91]It's dangerous in there.
[61:28.22]How do I do it?
[61:30.52]Nope.
[61:31.34]I forgot how to do it.
[61:33.65]Goku?
[61:34.37]I forgot.
[61:35.09]I actually don't remember how to do it.
[61:37.35]Okay.
[61:38.67]Why risk it?
[61:43.53]Goku.
[61:48.52]Problem is, good old boss raised the bridge of Eldon to make sure that mean divine beast couldn't get over here.
[61:55.84]You lost his touch?
[61:57.00]Yeah.
[61:57.36]I don't feel well.
[62:04.59]Use the cannon.
[62:05.27]You can't use the cannon if boss won't come down here.
[62:10.08]That means we're out of luck.
[62:12.10]Oh.
[62:12.66]It occurs to me that you know how to use the cannons.
[62:14.60]I do.
[62:14.84]Okay.
[62:15.84]I'll just shoot the cannons at it.
[62:20.12]I'm going to be the cannonball.
[62:21.66]And you'll launch me.
[62:24.99]I've got Daruk's protection, Goro.
[62:28.05]My ancestor's help can't possibly fail me.
[62:30.83]That means I can smash into anything and I won't hurt one bit.
[62:34.22]OK.
[62:37.74]OK.
[62:40.22]OK.
[62:41.76]Let's shoot you out of a cannon.
[62:45.50]Did I shoot him at the bridge?
[62:54.05]Is this lined up right?
[63:08.56]Shoot him into the lava.
[63:18.45]I'm looking forward to The Sims.
[63:20.15]I think that's gonna be a lot of fun.
[63:25.45]You good?
[63:28.59]We did it.
[63:29.73]Time to do the Divine Beast.
[63:36.84]Let's get a move on across that bridge.
[63:49.87]Sims, let's go.
[63:50.41]It should be fun.
[63:51.81]Alright, let's do this.
[63:57.68]We ready to move?
[64:02.98]Bridge of Eldin.
[64:05.63]That's pretty cool looking.
[64:06.43]I need to talk to you.
[64:09.19]Divine Beast Varudania is out causing trouble again.
[64:13.15]Let's go stop him.
[64:13.97]I wonder how we get in.
[64:32.14]Definitely in his mouth.
[64:34.22]yep he's gonna go like we have to run or in his legs okay pick out the drone things
[65:05.10]What's this?
[65:07.82]What?
[65:38.37]A wink?
[65:41.63]How are you going to see a whistle?
[65:45.27]When I hear your whistle, I'll stop in my tracks to start moving forward.
[65:48.07]I like it.
[65:49.51]Even though it's kind of like calling a horse.
[65:51.71]Okay, I'm counting on you.
[65:52.93]So I got to tell him when to stop and when to go.
[65:55.11]We just play red light, green light.
[65:58.47]Alright, we'll go.
[65:59.81]Go do it.
[66:02.15]Oh, yeah.
[66:05.49]Alright, you're ready.
[66:06.87]Alright, you're ready.
[66:10.47]That's just testing.
[66:11.21]I don't understand.
[66:15.02]I don't get it.
[66:18.16]Isn't he... We have to scale this whole mountain together, but isn't he just going to walk behind me?
[66:23.34]Why don't we just stay on the edge here?
[66:33.43]What are you doing?
[66:42.85]I don't get what's happening here.
[66:50.97]Isn't he going to stop if I stop?
[66:54.39]I'm not telling him to do anything.
[67:01.80]Just don't go in the circle, OK?
[67:08.58]So stay here.
[67:12.74]Don't move.
[67:17.36]Nope.
[67:18.42]How fast can you go?
[67:25.28]This is bait, but I'm going to take it anyways.
[67:26.92]Um.
[67:40.81]Can I shoot these down?
[67:42.39]Wait, can I move these?
[68:11.73]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[68:22.81]Okay, we need to move these rocks out of the way.
[68:25.94]Stop, don't go anywhere.
[68:33.38]Alright.
[68:48.36]Nice job.
[68:53.55]Why is this here?
[68:54.05]This is in a weird spot.
[68:55.73]Isn't this in a weird spot?
[69:28.93]This doesn't seem so bad.
[69:29.77]Alright, I'm going to get in here and I'm going to shoot you to... Where am I going to shoot you to?
[69:36.12]Why would I do this?
[69:48.97]I don't want him to go that way.
[69:50.19]Why would I do this?
[69:58.34]This feels weird that I shouldn't be doing it like this, but whatever, I'll try it.
[70:10.69]Wasn't I not supposed to alert this creature?
[70:21.08]Did you do it wrong?
[70:21.66]We did it.
[70:22.10]Oh, okay.
[70:27.96]No, we, okay, so we just have to keep doing it like this.
[70:30.32]Alright, sounds good.
[70:31.70]Alright, we got just two, um, drones here.
[70:38.74]How far do they go?
[70:40.96]Come here.
[70:47.92]I'm doing it pretty good, I think.
[70:52.51]Alright.
[70:53.23]How far back did they come?
[70:54.67]This one stops there.
[70:55.61]This is going to be hell on Earth.
[70:57.45]I already know it.
[70:59.19]Alright.
[70:59.39]This is as far as it goes.
[71:00.49]Let me take a quick... I need to take a look because I'm going to screw this up.
[71:08.22]Is there any safe place?
[71:09.58]Oh, I have to keep moving the whole time.
[71:19.07]So I have to...
[71:28.17]Take a picture.
[71:34.05]You stay here.
[71:36.28]I don't want you to get in trouble.
[71:37.80]I need to look.
[71:40.70]Alright, there is.
[71:44.36]Alright, there's a safe place right there.
[71:46.76]Ready to move.
[71:58.21]Go.
[72:03.73]Get in here.
[72:06.41]Stay right there.
[72:06.93]Alright, then I go now.
[72:10.75]Which would... Get me to... I don't know.
[72:14.13]Where am I trying to get to?
[72:14.85]I gotta... I gotta go alone.
[72:22.17]There is a safe spot right in the middle.
[72:25.45]Is that accurate?
[72:30.20]Is it safe right here?
[72:31.72]I think this is a safe spot, like right here.
[72:36.08]Oh!
[72:39.80]It is.
[72:40.04]Okay, get over here.
[72:45.91]Hurry, get over here.
[72:49.65]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[72:53.51]Oh, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around.
[73:02.72]Oh, fuck.
[73:03.48]Where'd we go?
[73:04.88]What?
[73:07.06]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[73:10.28]Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around.
[73:12.70]Turn, turn, come back here.
[73:14.38]Back, back, back.
[73:14.78]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[73:17.36]I don't get it.
[73:22.44]What?
[73:22.96]It stops.
[73:23.76]How do you...
[73:33.75]Can you hold the umbrella up for me too?
[73:35.69]Fuck you, buddy.
[73:53.57]I don't get it.
[73:57.69]Do I have to climb?
[73:59.84]Ah.
[74:05.82]What the fuck just happened?
[74:07.38]Excuse me?
[74:13.20]I'm getting up there.
[74:13.76]I don't give a shit if you come with me.
[74:21.46]Stay there.
[74:22.08]Don't move.
[74:25.65]Are you safe right there?
[74:26.99]He's not gonna get caught, right?
[74:32.85]Are you gonna get caught?
[74:41.76]Just get over here.
[74:43.42]Come over here right now.
[74:44.46]You have an invincibility shield.
[74:46.52]You can move, dude.
[75:16.68]What?
[75:45.65]It doesn't matter.
[75:46.29]I think we can still make it.
[75:47.51]We can still make it.
[75:50.67]No, pick the shield.
[76:07.01]Get over here.
[76:09.07]Get over here.
[76:10.83]Move your ass right now.
[76:13.43]Okay, we're fine.
[76:20.18]So.
[76:22.54]How do we get by this one?
[76:26.06]I think, wait a minute.
[76:28.06]I think I know.
[76:48.23]I wasn't even going to do it like that.
[76:49.43]It's dead by accident.
[76:55.07]It's over here.
[77:03.76]Okay.
[77:14.67]Almost there.
[77:21.98]What is that?
[77:22.58]Okay.
[77:23.34]Can you fight?
[77:28.08]What?
[77:30.59]Don't let him activate any of this shit.
[77:35.81]I need a bow.
[77:46.95]What should I use for a bow?
[77:48.59]I don't want to equip anything.
[77:54.68]Who cares about that?
[77:58.38]I don't need it.
[77:59.98]Alright.
[78:01.11]Another cannon to shoot from.
[78:20.84]Up here?
[78:21.98]Let's go.
[78:34.27]One more, I'm assuming.
[78:47.81]It's probably the hardest stretch here.
[78:49.13]I don't know why I couldn't get through the first part.
[78:51.51]Okay.
[78:53.22]Good work.
[79:02.98]I hope I have little save points every now and again here.
[79:04.86]That would be horrible if I didn't.
[79:18.44]In fact, you know what?
[79:20.32]I don't trust myself at all.
[79:21.48]I'm eating as many fucking apples, fishes, and potatoes as I have in my inventory.
[79:25.42]Didn't I get like roasted bass?
[79:30.12]I did.
[79:31.58]Doesn't really heal that much.
[79:32.48]Alright, how far does it go?
[79:41.45]God.
[79:58.02]You stay here.
[80:00.74]Don't move.
[80:03.13]I think I know what I need to do.
[80:05.51]But I don't know.
[80:06.35]So let's find out if I know what I'm doing.
[80:14.65]I don't know what I'm doing.
[80:17.94]I know what I'm doing.
[80:19.32]I just did it to the wrong one.
[80:46.34]so
[81:37.90]I'm alright, I'm okay.
[81:42.58]What are you doing?
[81:43.42]Alright, so what was the point of that?
[82:04.23]What was the point of that?
[82:06.48]Break all that to fly up for no reason?
[82:09.58]Do I have to put something there?
[82:19.25]I know what to do.
[82:39.43]He's gotta free a lizard.
[82:48.62]Come on, really?
[83:11.33]I think I hit way too hard.
[83:12.33]That was way too hard.
[83:21.95]Does it come back?
[83:23.23]Will it spawn again?
[83:24.29]Do I have to die?
[83:26.64]You know what?
[83:28.24]Let's go.
[83:28.98]Fuck it.
[83:29.38]Let's go.
[83:29.84]Just walk.
[83:30.50]Just walk.
[83:30.88]You can make it.
[83:31.98]Trust me.
[83:32.32]You can make it.
[83:32.82]Go.
[83:34.74]You can make it.
[83:35.42]Just trust me.
[83:36.28]Just go now.
[83:37.97]Actually, perfect timing, I think.
[83:39.31]Come on, come on, come on, come on!
[83:40.66]Don't walk into the middle!
[83:43.68]Did I eat it?
[84:15.65]You idiot!
[84:16.55]Okay.
[84:24.38]Alright, do not... I did it way too hard.
[84:26.64]I thought the thing was so heavy.
[84:27.74]I just... It was like a fucking... Okay.
[84:33.58]Stay here.
[84:33.92]Oh!
[84:39.21]It's another one.
[84:39.91]Alright, can I... How am I gonna move this?
[84:59.70]I need to kick it.
[85:01.10]Hit it.
[85:02.18]Yeah, but it's wedged against this rock!
[85:06.59]This way?
[85:07.19]I'm going to shoot it this way.
[85:08.13]I don't know.
[85:08.41]Whatever.
[85:08.67]Let's see what happens.
[85:13.69]That's it.
[85:14.01]That's it.
[85:14.27]That's enough, right?
[85:15.21]One more?
[85:18.42]One more.
[85:19.56]Two more.
[85:22.70]I quit.
[85:30.20]Actually, this is safe.
[85:46.79]I hate this mission.
[85:56.77]Hey, if you're above the clouds, you can't get hit.
[86:06.13]I need to get down, please.
[86:07.25]I need to get down, please.
[86:28.24]Okay.
[86:52.30]Are you doing over... Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking... He's gonna hit it again.
[86:54.97]Alright, I swear to god, I don't... I was gonna take it.
[87:00.39]I can't... I have to be on the ground.
[87:02.37]No, he's running back!
[87:03.45]Oh my god, he's running back.
[87:07.06]That hit me right in the face.
[87:17.43]I actually should die.
[87:19.11]I should die because I need to respawn the rock that I'm doing wrong.
[87:21.91]I need to get the rock to go up and hit the thing or whatever.
[87:25.19]Just start over at the checkpoint, which is right here.
[87:31.61]If he wasn't running back, he could have kept going.
[87:37.23]Pet the dog?
[87:38.03]There is no dog.
[87:41.42]Okay, get over here.
[87:45.74]Wait, how far away is this?
[87:48.73]No, okay, perfect.
[87:50.01]Okay, okay, okay.
[87:51.49]Where's the rock?
[87:53.41]Where's the rock?
[87:54.21]There's no rock anymore.
[87:55.11]The rock is gone.
[87:55.77]It's permanently gone.
[87:57.25]No, it's up there.
[88:02.00]So, do I have this idea right?
[88:06.04]Do I have to break these first?
[88:07.42]First?
[88:11.25]Where I push it down there and it gets sucked up and hits it and breaks it.
[88:19.86]That's wrong.
[88:21.98]It's wrong.
[88:30.69]What if I need to magnetize?
[88:36.99]I can't magnetize it.
[88:43.15]I can stop these from moving.
[88:48.34]Magnetize the soccer ball.
[88:49.60]Magnetize the soccer ball.
[88:50.96]Fly and then kapow.
[88:54.48]Wait.
[88:55.60]Hold on.
[88:59.72]Wait a minute.
[89:02.68]Wait a minute.
[89:03.10]You mean I can fly and then kapow?
[89:05.31]Let me try that.
[89:25.88]Alright, why Kapow?
[89:35.39]That's why I went way all the way over here to do this, but I was curious.
[89:40.25]So Kapow, can I do this?
[90:06.78]I mean, I did it, but I didn't.
[90:09.18]I got hit by the blades and it saw me.
[90:11.78]I don't think you can do that.
[90:15.58]World kapow.
[90:17.02]Boulder kapow.
[90:24.53]I don't get it.
[90:34.28]Like, do I have to shoot the boulder at it to hit and break it?
[90:38.26]I feel like that's wrong.
[90:42.26]Minecraft.
[90:43.06]Kapow.
[90:46.04]Missile.
[90:46.38]Kapow.
[90:46.82]Kapow.
[90:47.50]No.
[90:48.42]Missile.
[90:48.90]Missile.
[90:49.30]Kapow.
[90:49.98]Missile.
[90:59.84]Creeper.
[91:00.77]Minecraft.
[91:01.35]Creeper.
[91:02.11]Boom.
[91:09.40]Creeper pow.
[91:11.04]I think that's what you guys are trying to tell me.
[91:12.26]I'm going to try it.
[91:13.56]I probably just aimed it wrong last time.
[91:24.95]Is that what I just have to aim it this way and get it correct?
[91:28.59]How many swings is it?
[91:35.13]Wait a minute.
[92:34.47]Why are these rocks here?
[92:36.20]Why are these boulders lined up like this?
[92:38.38]Why is this boulder here?
[92:39.44]Alright, in my brain, this is like, hey, let's set up a little puzzle here.
[92:44.44]We got this big boulder that you can move and it's really in frame and it's something you have to look at and walk by.
[92:50.47]And yeah, maybe roll it down the hill so it gets sucked up and then gets kids to think.
[92:55.11]Why are these here?
[92:57.61]That's just bait.
[92:58.37]It's just a bait puzzle.
[93:01.57]Because honestly, I could have just done this the whole time.
[93:04.62]Just do this?
[93:07.23]Oh, thank goodness I didn't get spotted.
[93:37.47]Maybe a better view.
[93:41.83]Where is it?
[93:45.16]Where is it?
[93:49.08]That sounded like it was a hundred years away.
[94:10.54]Wait, I didn't know I could do that.
[94:16.77]What am I doing?
[94:19.97]Why did I press the button a second time?
[94:22.53]Why did I do that?
[94:25.47]Because I'm a monkey with tools.
[94:28.87]I'm a fucking ape.
[94:30.49]I'm a monkey.
[94:31.17]How did I get that wrong?
[94:33.93]I don't even understand how I did that wrong.
[94:37.01]I... I... I just... I don't understand.
[94:39.66]I thought it was... Ah, you never seen anybody get a double in this game before.
[94:59.72]There was no reason for me to press the button a second time.
[95:01.86]I just... I don't know.
[95:02.82]My mind was just like... Is it close enough?
[95:06.34]Try.
[95:07.96]Stop.
[95:08.44]Don't talk to me.
[95:11.33]Fuck you and your shield.
[95:12.95]Why can't I... Why can't I have one of those?
[95:19.69]Okay.
[95:20.59]We're gonna do this now the correct way.
[95:22.95]Everyone's saying fly and then drop the bomb.
[95:26.08]I'm gonna fly and I'm gonna drop the bomb.
[95:37.98]Okay, just don't drop it in the wind, right?
[95:42.39]Don't do it in the wind.
[95:44.21]Fly over.
[95:45.03]Whoa, look at that.
[95:46.37]Ooh, explosive.
[95:48.05]Okay, fuck.
[95:51.73]Fine.
[96:03.33]No, stupid idiot.
[96:26.30]These are like super crates.
[96:31.36]Can I pick these up and smash them?
[96:38.93]Hey, heads up, heads up, heads up down there.
[96:50.65]What should I do?
[96:51.19]Wait, I should probably use this.
[96:55.98]I'm going to need these later.
[96:56.96]I'm taking them with me.
[96:57.58]I'm taking all these with me.
[97:25.22]What the f- Can I have one?
[97:30.75]Can I please have one?
[97:32.35]Why did it let go?
[97:42.22]Frank, just come over here.
[97:44.56]Frank, whatever your name is.
[97:46.92]Just come over here.
[97:47.80]It's safe.
[97:48.78]It's safe now.
[97:50.28]You can walk this way.
[97:51.42]It is completely safe.
[97:52.66]I'm promising you there's no monsters.
[97:54.62]And there is absolutely no drones that are going to be shooting at us.
[98:06.02]I don't even know how it's even possible to drop all three of them in the lava.
[98:08.72]I don't even know.
[98:09.21]It's not.
[98:09.59]It's not.
[98:28.32]What's happening?
[98:32.60]Whoa!
[99:01.78]Watch out!
[99:02.10]Don't get hit!
[99:30.73]Alright, we made it.
[99:31.47]I did it.
[99:33.19]I actually, I made it.
[99:34.03]It's not like Shaggy.
[99:38.11]Okay, this is it.
[99:39.69]I made it.
[99:41.03]I'm finally here.
[100:15.85]That was fun.
[100:19.36]That was... I got it now.
[100:20.82]I understand.
[100:26.61]That was hard to watch.
[100:33.46]You know what I think is pretty funny about the Breath of the Wild playthrough so far?
[100:39.06]People act like I'm playing a horror game.
[100:43.50]I watched that with one eye open, leaning back in my chair.
[100:46.42]Dude, that was so hard to watch.
[100:49.10]I was barely looking at it.
[100:50.54]I couldn't even stand looking at it.
[100:51.98]It was so horrible.
[100:52.88]Is he alright?
[101:01.01]Oh my god, that looked so horrid.
[101:04.36]What's wrong with his face?
[101:11.54]Stream is a horror movie.
[101:22.80]Bro, they're just cringe.
[101:29.13]I appreciate that.
[101:29.89]Thank you.
[101:36.72]You did fine.
[101:37.70]It was fun.
[101:38.20]I mean, whatever.
[101:40.08]Hey, I'm having a good time.
[101:43.22]Hey, little guy.
[101:44.96]Long time no see.
[101:46.28]Goku?
[101:48.90]I always knew you'd come back.
[101:51.01]You know, I never stopped believing in you.
[101:54.67]You're here to take control of old Redania back from Ganon, eh?
[102:01.03]You're gonna need a map that shows the guts of this place.
[102:14.31]Oh, as in they're cringing at this.
[102:15.79]Okay, so I have access now to this second spirit thing.
[102:19.26]It's really dark in here.
[102:45.30]Is this... Do I need a torch or something?
[102:55.71]Dragonbone Boko Club.
[103:09.96]Okay.
[103:20.43]I figured it out.
[103:24.39]There is just a torch here now.
[103:25.59]Alright, let me throw this away.
[103:29.07]Can I get rid of the sword now?
[103:34.13]I'm afraid to throw that away.
[103:35.03]I feel like I can't get one of those ever again.
[103:36.41]Should I throw it?
[103:41.53]Is everybody going to freak out if I throw the lino sword into the wall and it explodes?
[103:50.87]Is that yes, throw it into the wall, or no, yes, you need to, yes, keep it.
[104:04.56]Yeah.
[104:06.78]Chat is going to freak out.
[104:08.10]If I throw, I'm going to let go in five seconds.
[104:10.34]Oh, I don't even have mod chat even open.
[104:14.36]They might be freaking out.
[104:25.40]Is it, uh, somebody's drinking milk?
[104:29.22]Oh, hi, Jerma.
[104:29.94]Hi.
[104:30.60]We're good.
[104:31.00]Alright, so if I let go of, uh, right trigger, people are gonna be mad.
[104:46.90]Everyone's typing.
[104:48.68]People are always mad.
[104:50.67]It's funny.
[104:55.50]It's over.
[104:56.10]Alright, torch.
[105:07.95]See if we can't see anything in here.
[105:09.45]Here we go.
[105:12.74]Alright, creepy.
[105:16.38]Cool.
[105:17.72]Anything else over here?
[105:39.41]Oh, that kind of sucks that it goes out.
[105:40.67]Um... Shit.
[105:43.47]Alright, I need... I gotta just... There's probably like five, ten of these.
[105:46.11]I'm just gonna look around for those first.
[105:54.04]Before I fight anything.
[105:57.40]Oops.
[106:08.99]What the fuck are you doing?
[106:19.62]I can't see anything.
[106:20.62]I need to put a bow on.
[106:29.44]I'm just putting on this, whatever, this royal bow.
[106:31.45]It doesn't matter.
[106:39.11]I'm going to die.
[106:47.84]Okay.
[106:48.50]Okay.
[107:12.25]Nice shot!
[107:26.46]Good, I'll use that.
[107:37.76]Okay.
[107:38.06]Let me just check this perimeter a little bit.
[107:44.22]Yeah.
[107:55.79]Two chests.
[107:59.42]Good.
[108:09.73]Well, I had a good thing I bought a lot of these.
[108:15.97]Can I actually turn the lights on here?
[108:17.45]Am I just being an idiot and doing this completely wrong?
[108:19.89]Does this turn the lights on?
[108:34.92]I don't know.
[108:35.82]Turn them on.
[108:59.69]Ooh.
[109:01.63]Alright, so just like the other one, the controls have been enabled.
[109:04.83]You're gonna have to help me out with this one.
[109:10.75]Nice job getting the map of the Divine Beast.
[109:14.19]The terminals that control Rudania are noted by the glowing points on your map.
[109:19.84]To take back Rudania, you'll need to activate all of the terminals.
[109:25.38]You got this, little guy.
[109:26.60]Okay.
[109:28.81]Yes, finally, I can see.
[109:42.83]Speaking of being able to see, I can... The camera was a little high on the camera.
[109:47.96]Alright, so here we are.
[109:49.70]I need to activate all these things.
[109:54.08]This should be fun.
[109:54.92]This is a beast.
[109:56.26]It's a giant shrine.
[109:57.12]It's like my favorite part of the whole game.
[110:01.16]So what can I do?
[110:02.67]I can... I can move this up or down?
[110:12.85]Put it back!
[110:13.37]Put it back!
[110:13.81]Put it back!
[110:14.46]Put that back!
[110:15.78]Put it back!
[110:16.48]Put it back!
[110:17.64]Put it back!
[110:18.24]Ow!
[110:26.26]Um... Okay, I need to turn that back.
[110:29.07]Let's go back the other way.
[110:37.11]Am I going the other way?
[110:37.89]I think I'm fucking this whole thing up.
[110:40.51]Alright, I'm on my... He's on his back?
[110:47.39]No.
[110:47.83]Is this correct?
[110:48.45]No, this is the right way.
[110:55.95]This wasn't here before.
[110:56.83]Okay.
[111:04.20]Alright.
[111:08.56]Let's just try going this way first.
[111:10.95]This is out kind of where I came in, right?
[111:15.97]I wonder if... Put that out.
[111:21.57]What was in my mouth?
[111:44.05]Okay, a ball has to go into here.
[111:46.50]Where do I get the ball?
[111:53.10]Just checking out all the rooms.
[111:54.32]Relax.
[111:58.40]Oh, you have to die.
[111:59.90]I think this thing is... Alright, so I have to touch that.
[112:12.15]I wonder if I can just jump to this.
[112:13.21]I'm going to try it.
[112:15.22]That works.
[112:23.20]Got one.
[112:23.72]Okay.
[112:24.16]Well, now that I'm up here.
[112:41.37]Oof.
[112:41.87]Alright.
[112:42.55]Um... Oh, I'm so pissed.
[112:46.60]What an idiot.
[112:48.66]I didn't mean to do that.
[112:50.02]Um... Well, I'm down here now, so whatever.
[112:51.46]I have to turn it again.
[112:56.54]What?
[113:04.54]What's happening?
[113:05.58]Okay.
[113:09.97]Um, I'm going to turn it this way again.
[113:11.97]Whoa.
[113:22.76]Alright.
[113:23.16]Okay.
[113:23.56]Alright.
[113:23.78]Alright.
[113:24.00]Right.
[113:24.18]Right.
[113:24.38]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[113:30.64]Ooh.
[113:31.48]How do I get that?
[113:32.07]I have to turn it, but I'm not going to fuck around right now.
[113:36.99]Maybe a minute.
[113:49.91]Link, what the hell are you doing?
[114:02.92]Whoa!
[114:27.40]Um... Come on!
[114:32.14]I can't light that?
[114:52.07]I'm getting turned around here.
[114:52.93]Alright, let me... What is it?
[114:53.99]What is going on here?
[114:59.04]Get rid of that.
[114:59.66]There's one up on his spine up there.
[115:16.92]I feel like I can get that one right now.
[115:21.86]I'm going to get that one right now.
[115:23.46]Check this out.
[115:24.00]Let's go.
[115:24.56]Hold on.
[115:26.32]If I spin him, I can walk along his spines?
[115:31.71]That sounds correct.
[115:37.19]There's also something over here, too.
[115:43.38]This might be stupid, but whatever.
[115:48.60]I don't know.
[115:48.98]Let's try it.
[115:52.24]Wrong way.
[115:52.94]I'm on the wrong side.
[115:54.52]Wrong side.
[115:55.28]Wrong side.
[115:56.46]Wrong side.
[115:57.02]I'm going in the lava.
[116:00.15]This is bad.
[116:33.68]Dammit!
[117:24.07]What's this?
[117:29.29]Oh, I found one.
[117:37.77]Oh, I can't do this one.
[117:40.05]I wonder if I can actually just brute force it and get up there.
[117:43.31]I think I probably can.
[117:45.37]But that's not the way I'm going to try to do this.
[117:47.95]So...
[117:55.80]Let's go up this way.
[118:07.19]What's this eyeball?
[118:08.17]Alright.
[118:08.97]I'm gonna do this.
[118:11.29]Right?
[118:13.13]I feel like this is correct.
[118:15.71]This seems like the right way to do this one.
[118:20.76]Kind of.
[118:29.61]Fuck you!
[118:35.19]I jumped through it?!
[118:36.17]How did I jump through that?
[118:43.78]The one spot that I couldn't land on is where I landed.
[118:48.50]I'm gonna try that again.
[118:50.76]I feel like I can get it this way.
[119:01.41]There it is, okay.
[119:10.79]Do I need the blue flame to do that?
[119:13.08]I think I need blue flame.
[119:14.46]Okay, well, where's the blue flame?
[119:26.15]Can I grab one easily from here?
[119:28.45]Through a window or something?
[119:32.13]Not really.
[119:37.10]Well, let me just go.
[119:37.80]I think I can get this one now.
[119:42.46]Alright, this is the one on the spine.
[119:43.70]Don't fucking fall, please.
[119:53.65]Oh, thank it.
[119:54.07]Okay.
[119:55.01]Really?
[120:00.31]Really?
[120:07.92]Really?
[120:08.22]Really?
[120:25.73]Where?
[120:25.99]I was wondering if it was on that side of the other side.
[120:36.09]There are three terminals remaining.
[120:38.73]I love these.
[120:39.47]These are so cool.
[120:44.83]I would love an entire game that was just this stuff.
[120:48.46]Just give me like 20 divine beasts and that's the entire video game.
[120:59.10]Alright, I need to light that blue flame.
[121:04.76]Where the hell was that?
[121:05.88]I don't know.
[121:07.08]Over here somewhere?
[121:07.68]I wanna... Can I... Hold on.
[121:12.14]I'm just gonna spin it.
[121:14.18]Okay, let's go.
[121:23.29]What happened?
[121:23.63]Alright.
[121:26.61]So, if I go around here... Ah!
[121:32.56]There's one right there.
[121:40.95]Oops, that's not how you do it.
[122:24.03]Um, I don't know.
[122:54.40]I think I got it.
[122:54.90]Don't hands in your head me.
[123:02.35]I got it.
[123:05.21]Now I have to... I don't have it.
[123:11.25]Ahaha!
[123:16.70]Ahaha!
[123:19.10]Ahaha!
[123:28.29]Get away from me.
[123:33.69]The other one's over here.
[123:34.45]Right?
[123:40.19]Because I flip it and then... Yeah, I gotta get up here.
[123:44.49]Watch this.
[123:45.03]I flip it and it's gotta be this way and then I can light this one.
[123:52.03]Right?
[123:53.99]I don't want to flip this shit and then I can... Hold on.
[124:04.36]Isn't there another one somewhere?
[124:05.22]Oh, that was the one.
[124:10.29]Alright, there's another one though.
[124:11.45]I swear there's another one.
[124:12.55]Maybe there's not.
[124:22.55]Have I lost it?
[124:23.86]Or is there another one?
[124:27.06]Well, let's try to do this ball one then.
[124:29.20]No?
[124:29.50]Okay.
[124:29.82]Well, I guess I'm wrong.
[124:32.40]Alright, I need to go down to where the ball may have dropped.
[124:35.12]Where did the ball go?
[124:45.26]Nice!
[124:48.82]Oh.
[125:00.85]Is that better than what I have on for anything?
[125:07.41]I guess I could get rid of this bow, right?
[125:17.47]Where did the ball go?
[125:26.57]I dropped the ball down, but I don't know where it is.
[125:28.79]Where did it drop down?
[125:33.30]It was like a tube, like a shaft or something.
[125:35.30]And where is it?
[125:36.56]I don't know where it is.
[125:39.22]I don't know.
[125:52.33]I'm just going to go down and look.
[126:04.61]Oh, wait a minute.
[126:05.35]What's this?
[126:06.37]Why is this in the way?
[126:12.64]What did that do?
[126:38.35]I get it.
[126:42.15]I get it.
[126:42.47]I think I get it.
[126:49.52]The ball comes down here?
[126:52.44]Am I wrong?
[126:55.16]So I move this out of the way, turn it.
[126:57.64]While it's frozen, right?
[127:01.17]That way?
[127:01.55]Make any sense?
[127:06.26]That makes sense to me, and I'm gonna see if it does anything.
[127:12.24]Is that enough?
[127:19.37]Yeah!
[127:32.42]One more after this.
[127:42.17]Two more after this is what I meant to say.
[127:46.91]Alright, so the other ones, one's in the tail, one's on the other side of his leg.
[127:49.54]Let's flip him again.
[127:51.46]Alright, this one's got all this grass shit all over it.
[127:56.70]What does this mean?
[127:59.03]Can this be... Oh, wait a minute.
[128:00.35]I know what to do with this.
[128:02.13]You think I'm stupid?
[128:03.13]I know exactly what to do with this.
[128:04.79]It's fire.
[128:06.01]Fire.
[128:12.71]That was easy.
[128:13.13]That one was simple.
[128:15.95]It was the easiest one of the whole night.
[128:33.12]Get out of the fucking way.
[128:40.32]Okay.
[128:41.92]Last one is in the tail.
[128:45.16]I wonder how far this is gonna be.
[128:46.60]I think it's probably underneath him.
[128:50.73]I gotta make him flip, right?
[128:54.39]Something to do with this shit.
[128:57.99]It's definitely something to do with that.
[129:14.42]Let me go outside and look.
[129:15.82]Did I break this?
[129:25.82]Hello.
[129:26.20]Let's open it.
[129:32.11]Alright, cool.
[129:33.15]I think I'm almost done with this.
[129:34.29]There's probably a boss at the end, right?
[129:48.57]I pick up an object.
[130:08.30]Wait.
[130:21.14]Wait, what am I doing?
[130:22.46]Can I fuck with anything in this room?
[130:55.90]Can I pull this?
[130:57.84]Can't pull it off?
[130:58.38]I can burn that.
[131:05.87]Wait, I can burn this.
[131:34.65]That scared the shit out of me.
[131:40.67]Oh, wait, I know what to do.
[131:41.95]Okay, ready?
[131:43.18]Watch this.
[131:43.64]Is this stupid or is this correct?
[131:46.86]Find out.
[131:54.76]Why is that not working?
[131:59.58]Oh, I'm overthinking it just a little bit here.
[132:08.55]Alright, let's go Do I have enough like health to do this and weapons and shit Nice that was the last head and start up the main control unit which is up on his back Start up the main control unit
[132:34.12]There should be a new glowing mark on your map.
[132:37.21]You're going to need to make your way over to that.
[132:40.45]Stay focused.
[132:41.49]Alright, so this is probably heat, so I'm going to be ready.
[132:50.15]I do have a lot of food.
[132:52.47]Although not really.
[132:53.39]I have to be careful.
[132:54.48]Alright, let's get back up there.
[133:07.74]What should I use as a weapon?
[133:15.52]Probably, I don't know, like the... I'm going to use like the ancient battle axe.
[133:20.20]Just get rid of this fucking thing.
[133:21.24]It's stupid.
[133:21.76]What do I have for arrows?
[133:31.86]I got a lot of ice arrows.
[133:33.02]I think I'm good.
[133:34.37]This shouldn't be too bad.
[133:47.25]Whatever it is.
[133:47.71]Let's go.
[133:56.96]Second Divine Beast about to be destroyed.
[134:01.10]Well, actually, we're not trying to destroy them.
[134:02.74]Activated.
[134:30.31]Okay.
[134:32.19]Firelight Ganon.
[134:33.35]I know how to deal with you.
[134:37.39]I shall.
[134:38.49]Watch yourself now.
[134:39.83]That ugly pain in the crack is Dan's handiwork.
[134:42.95]Thing got the best of me a hundred years ago.
[134:44.68]Take a picture.
[134:46.22]I will.
[134:47.90]Good luck, little guy.
[134:49.02]Go get him!
[134:51.58]Crazy looking.
[134:55.92]Watch out for that sword.
[135:01.72]Good.
[135:02.30]Alright, that's a good picture.
[135:03.06]Okay.
[135:08.35]No, no, no.
[135:08.65]Keep the L ones, fine.
[135:11.33]Get out.
[135:13.27]I swear to God, man.
[135:14.47]A, X is B, and B is A, and A is Y, and B is X. Just kill me.
[135:20.06]Honestly.
[135:21.12]Alright, I'm gonna do fire resistance.
[135:31.50]No, defense boost.
[135:36.75]Flurry, rush!
[135:46.40]Ooh!
[136:18.99]Back up, back up, back it up.
[136:20.95]What's happening?
[136:21.39]Alright, fire resistant.
[136:36.28]That flaming ball is dangerous.
[136:55.68]What the fuck?
[137:00.53]Hide behind something?
[137:03.41]I don't... I think I have to hide.
[137:07.08]All that for a little ball like that?
[137:08.72]Man, that thing is tiny.
[137:11.36]Wow.
[137:12.54]Be careful of that big scary... There's nothing.
[137:14.69]That was terrible.
[137:34.91]okay so what am I how do I stop this does it like reflect it whoa
[138:03.80]He sucks it up.
[138:11.63]I freaked out.
[138:12.29]I don't know.
[138:29.75]I got it.
[138:38.21]Goodbye.
[138:44.92]That wasn't too bad.
[138:46.88]The last boss I think was harder because of the water.
[138:49.36]And I think my internet was freaking out too.
[139:12.44]There we go.
[139:13.16]Second Divine Beast.
[139:24.67]You are no good at this game.
[139:25.91]Oh, you said you are so good at this game.
[139:27.53]Sorry, I read that wrong.
[139:32.73]Card container.
[139:33.17]I'll take it.
[139:37.58]Oh, I also need to upgrade...
[139:40.81]I have four spirit orbs.
[139:42.61]So I can upgrade.
[139:49.15]Very nice.
[139:56.28]Once you activate the main control, you will not be the... I got everything, didn't I?
[140:03.66]I think I got everything inside.
[140:04.73]Most of it.
[140:12.11]I love the Divine Beasts.
[140:15.81]Am I the weirdo that thinks the shrines are the best part of this whole game?
[140:18.49]I know I've asked this before, but they're the most fun.
[140:23.09]Actually, I like the little weird puzzles and little combat things.
[140:36.60]Shadow of the Colossus?
[140:38.58]I have already beat that game though, years and years and years ago.
[140:42.44]I would play it again.
[140:43.24]They did a remaster of it, didn't they?
[140:44.50]I feel like I should apologize.
[140:46.76]I was doing all I could to protect Hyrule when that thing got the best of me.
[140:51.36]Sorry that me wrestling with the rubble caused such a mess.
[140:56.86]The good news is, Rutani is now back under our control.
[141:01.98]That means that our century-old Ganon beatdown plan can finally go into effect.
[141:08.27]I'm going to take this down the mountain.
[141:10.40]I'll have a better shot at Ganon there.
[141:13.36]And then once you've made your way into Hyrule Castle, we're going to light that thing up.
[141:18.44]I feel like this guy's still talking from like a thousand feet away.
[141:21.14]I want to give you something.
[141:22.54]It's a special power of mine called Daruk's Protection.
[141:26.88]It's no good to me now that I'm a spirit, but it might be useful for you.
[141:33.41]Here it comes!
[141:34.69]New power.
[141:40.04]So I'm going to assume that you can just run to Ganon at the very first 10 minutes of the game and try to beat it in an hour.
[141:48.22]Is that accurate?
[141:48.74]You don't have to do all this?
[141:50.98]That's cool.
[141:59.15]From this moment forth, the power of protection from the depths of my soul now lives inside you.
[142:10.59]Good luck, little guy.
[142:11.71]That's what a lot of people did.
[142:12.71]And give my regards to the princess.
[142:16.78]That would actually be kind of sad.
[142:19.22]If on your first playthrough, you've been waiting for this game, let's say, for like five years.
[142:25.07]And you just go, I'm going to go investigate the castle.
[142:28.21]And it's the end of the game.
[142:29.35]And you just like beat the whole game and you just... Oh, fuck.
[142:33.10]Oops.
[142:33.36]Oops.
[142:36.94]Didn't mean to do that.
[142:37.80]This is a huge map, and you just don't explore any of it.
[142:41.33]You just see the credits.
[142:44.39]That did happen.
[142:54.13]You only have three hearts, though.
[142:55.57]Yeah.
[143:13.25]You can beat the game with a stick.
[143:16.24]Damn.
[143:28.88]Well, that ought to do it.
[143:31.23]We're set here.
[143:32.81]Now we just gotta wait for the perfect shot.
[143:37.85]Once Link is in the castle, Plutonio will unleash an epic blast.
[143:43.20]Ganon won't know what hit him.
[143:48.22]Hyrule looks pretty good from up here, even after a hundred years.
[143:54.31]The old rolling grounds sure are a sight for sore eyes.
[143:58.87]I wonder how the Gorons fared after the Great Calamity.
[144:02.19]I sure hope everyone down there is still going strong after every, huh?
[144:15.70]Hey, look at that.
[144:18.43]Still going strong indeed.
[144:30.33]Oh, by the way, son, I passed down our family power to somebody else.
[144:34.12]It's not you.
[144:36.88]Link has it.
[144:38.30]Yeah!
[144:45.43]He does have it.
[144:47.09]Oh.
[144:47.23]Never mind.
[145:06.40]Okay, so... Protective power containing the perfect defense of the champion Daruk.
[145:12.97]It will automatically protect you from all manner of attacks as long as you're holding ZL.
[145:19.47]Really?
[145:19.75]Oh, fuck.
[145:21.75]Don't do that.
[145:26.19]How long does it last?
[145:30.49]So, it's essentially just a... You take three hits for free.
[145:38.37]that's pretty helpful three blocks then it recharges it's very useful though cool cool cool cool cool very cool alright I'm gonna complete this mission and I need a spirit orb thing because I want to I should just probably stamina
[146:05.42]Thanks so much.
[146:06.02]I don't exactly know what you were doing in Rudania, but... Well, it seems to have calmed down.
[146:10.43]You know, while I was up there, I could have sworn I saw Lord Daruk standing on top of Rudania.
[146:15.89]I wonder, was that his ghost?
[146:17.11]I don't know how to explain it, but somehow I feel a lot braver now.
[146:21.20]Oh, that's right.
[146:22.28]I talked to Boss about you, and he said to bring you to him.
[146:25.54]An order from Boss can't be refused.
[146:27.10]Moving on.
[146:27.48]This looks like fun.
[146:36.01]Uh, okay.
[146:36.31]I need one of those shrines.
[146:37.99]This one here somewhere, right?
[146:40.84]You said earlier you would play a game full of only Divine Beasts.
[146:43.74]That's basically every other Zelda game.
[146:47.76]Yeah.
[146:49.38]Somehow different.
[146:56.25]Is that true?
[146:56.75]Uh, I need... Where's a... Is there a shrine here?
[147:05.80]He's trying in every town, right?
[147:06.84]Alright, what's the boss have to say?
[147:20.05]Side... Side on the main dude's house?
[147:23.07]Okay.
[147:25.71]You really are something.
[147:26.48]I can't believe you conquered Rudania.
[147:28.26]Calling me impressed.
[147:29.74]But good griefs, you have to do it just when my back pain went away.
[147:32.28]I was already in... We're gonna go.
[147:36.33]Now you made it look like I was just fibbing about my back pain.
[147:42.11]Oh, and I'm also happy to see Yunobo finally got his act together.
[147:45.63]I know that's your doing as well.
[147:47.70]But enough back patting and other such nonsense.
[147:49.96]Take a look at this.
[147:50.44]Calm down.
[147:54.22]It's returned to its peaceful ways.
[147:56.18]Now we can get back to digging for ore around Death Mountain.
[148:00.24]Alright, still got a thank you.
[148:03.13]Wait, do I get an item?
[148:06.60]There's some treasure in my house.
[148:07.60]I actually get stuff?
[148:10.46]Alright, it's a sharp blade.
[148:11.46]Yep.
[148:13.32]Weapon!
[148:15.84]However, as a Hylian, you probably already know.
[148:17.84]Apparently, 100 years ago, the Hylian champion had a legendary blade, the sword that seals... What would they say?
[148:23.79]The sword that sleeps in a forest.
[148:25.07]I already saw it!
[148:27.09]I have already found it.
[148:27.73]13 hearts, right?
[148:37.78]what's my treasure boulder breaker that thing's huge nice boulder breaker very cool alright let me not use that the next like 12 hours of gameplay
[149:06.80]You know, I thought about this joke, and I'm not going to do it because I think it would really piss everybody off.
[149:12.65]I've been really thinking, contemplating this, if I should do this or not.
[149:16.63]But I'm not going to do it, so you can just laugh at it now.
[149:20.45]All these weapons that I've been hoarding for the longest time, and I'm just never going to use them.
[149:23.81]I was thinking of when I get to Ganon at the end of the game, just all throw every single one of them at him and break them all.
[149:32.21]Just like one, two, three, and just see what people do.
[149:39.07]But I feel like I could break.
[149:40.27]I feel like I could fuck up the whole game.
[149:44.94]I'm actually concerned to do that, but just know if you see me do that, that's like the laugh out loud thing that I was planning.
[149:53.52]Because I'm never going to use these.
[149:55.04]That's like, you know, you always hold on to your shit.
[149:58.34]The Resident Evil bullshit where you get the rocket launcher halfway through the game, you don't shoot it once.
[150:03.51]You have like eight rounds for it, and then you just shoot the fucking tyrant eight times with the rocket launcher.
[150:11.53]And then watch the credits roll.
[150:19.45]Alright, so, uh, look at the shrine.
[150:23.39]Over here.
[150:23.77]There it is.
[150:25.57]Alright, should I do hearts or stamina?
[150:28.91]What do I have?
[150:29.37]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 hearts?
[150:32.35]I could get to 10 hearts.
[150:39.28]Yeah, that's probably safe.
[150:47.44]Almost at a second row, right?
[150:48.58]It's 10 and 10 and 10?
[151:01.55]If you're wearing pants, which is unlikely, can we have an outfit tour?
[151:05.57]No, I've got pants on, but I'm not going to give you an outfit tour.
[151:11.02]Okay, cool.
[151:11.94]So that's that.
[151:14.88]And that's where I'm probably going to end the stream.
[151:18.34]I'm gonna go take another dose of medicine.
[151:20.44]Relax.
[151:20.84]I'm glad I was able to stream today though, because I... I don't know.
[151:25.15]I feel like I've been like away from my personal broadcast for a little while.
[151:29.79]And I really did not... When I got COVID a few days ago, it was just like, fuck.
[151:35.89]I hadn't streamed like a week before that.
[151:38.37]I took a long break in October.
[151:39.81]So I really want to participate.
[151:45.13]But yeah.
[151:47.38]He's radioactive.
[151:48.48]No, I'm fine.
[151:49.98]Can we get an outfit tour?
[151:52.28]Here's your outfit tour.
[151:56.95]There.
[151:59.33]But yeah, tomorrow, the plan is now... Again, I have to make sure that if I wake up and I'm really screwed up, VR is going to have to move a day.
[152:09.12]But the plan is...
[152:12.04]sus guy rebrand tomorrow uh and we're gonna play among us VR I think I've already talked to a few people obviously vinny was interested um I think Charlie was interested too in playing um his group there that we might uh say hello to them for a little bit I might just bounce around whoever's playing it right I might just like I don't want to be annoying though because that scream is
[152:37.31]is essentially one just huge joke to me.
[152:42.26]Right?
[152:42.64]Doesn't mean you'll see tomorrow.
[152:46.52]But wherever I can bounce around as the fucking sus guy scream, that's where I'm going to go.
[152:52.45]We'll see.
[152:54.97]Yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be playing it.
[152:59.10]This thing with Among Us, you need like 30 people, right?
[153:02.01]You need like 20 people to play it.
[153:03.85]So I'm going to have to just jump into random lobbies.
[153:08.74]Or play it with like a group like, um... Like I said, like Charlie and some of those were interested, so... But I need to be better.
[153:17.54]And if I'm gonna be in VR, I need to take the time now to go just chill and just put my head down.
[153:23.89]Keep an eye on the sus if for some reason it's all fucked up.
[153:26.39]For some reason I'm... Do you understand the core gameplay of Among Us?
[153:30.37]I have no idea.
[153:32.15]Here's what I know.
[153:32.71]I know that you have to pretend to do jobs.
[153:38.37]And if you're... Well, you have to do jobs, but if you're the imposter, you have to pretend to do them too and kill people while you're pretending to do stuff.
[153:49.50]I've never played Among Us before.
[153:50.74]I don't even understand how it works.
[153:53.00]All I know is that... Oh, man, I saw this guy in admin.
[153:54.94]That's the only thing I said.
[153:56.76]Emergency meeting!
[153:57.58]I don't even know what that means.
[153:59.03]I don't know what that means.
[154:00.17]It just means like, hey, call in a meeting to determine who killed who.
[154:08.65]I'm just going to first lobby him in, dude.
[154:10.37]I'm pressing the button fucking immediately.
[154:14.77]And then I'm going to turn and like run and cartoon break through my fucking drywall.
[154:19.09]Bugs Bunny style.
[154:21.64]And then uninstall the game.
[154:26.38]I should have a big button.
[154:32.72]I got COVID and I got one day to prepare this.
[154:36.10]So I don't know.
[154:36.86]I don't think so.
[154:42.49]I don't think I can even have a huge button in the middle of my room when I'm playing it.
[154:49.48]That would be so funny though if there's just a huge red button and I have to go to press it and I don't even know where it is.
[154:58.41]We'll see what I can come up with in the next 12 hours.
[155:03.94]My eight-year-old brother saw you on my screen and said, oh my god, that's the sus guy.
[155:09.22]By the way, I'm going to tell you right now, tomorrow is going to be an incredibly G-rated stream.
[155:14.52]I'm not going to say any swears.
[155:16.42]I'm the sus guy, you know what I mean?
[155:19.16]We're going to break number records tomorrow.
[155:22.93]Tomorrow is... You better be prepared.
[155:27.37]I'm trying to break every record on this channel tomorrow.
[155:33.24]It's all gonna be like, freaking, it's gonna be like, whoa, like... Yikes, you know what I mean?
[155:39.96]I gotta be very careful.
[155:44.57]What time tomorrow?
[155:45.31]I have no idea.
[155:46.89]At some point tomorrow afternoon, I would imagine.
[155:51.39]People are gonna be so pissed.
[155:53.39]Not really, but I don't know.
[155:55.23]I think it's funny, so I'm doing it.
[155:57.06]But you'll just see, there's gonna be shit all over the screen.
[155:59.22]It's gonna be fucking unbearable.
[156:01.44]Um...
[156:03.17]I'll probably turn it off like halfway through.
[156:04.59]I don't know.
[156:04.91]We'll see.
[156:06.33]It's going to be unbearable.
[156:10.31]It's going to be like, I don't know.
[156:11.26]You'll see.
[156:12.18]It's going to be annoying.
[156:14.82]But it should be fun.
[156:16.04]Is this going to be your worst stream ever tomorrow?
[156:22.04]It depends on what you determine that to be.
[156:25.18]If I'm honest.
[156:28.91]You're either gonna think it's the worst stream I've ever done, or you're gonna think it's your favorite stream of the whole year.
[156:33.68]It depends.
[156:44.29]Stream Roblox after it.
[156:50.99]It's gonna suck.
[157:03.02]Delay it to Saturday?
[157:04.46]I mean, I gotta play it at the launch.
[157:07.74]If I'm gonna do this, it has to happen tomorrow.
[157:11.70]Among Us VR launch.
[157:13.19]Everyone's so hyped about it.
[157:14.85]If there's one day to do it, it's tomorrow.
[157:23.64]So, uh, I'm gonna get VR set up.
[157:26.98]Troubleshoot it, because you know it's gonna take like six hours.
[157:30.38]Um... Get some... Dayquil in me.
[157:35.30]Uh, tomorrow's stream, I'm gonna... I don't know what to expect tomorrow, because... Having COVID and playing VR might be a recipe for disaster.
[157:45.91]But this joke has to happen, so I'm streaming for at least an hour.
[157:49.43]You know what I mean?
[157:50.73]I'm streaming for at least, like, a couple of games.
[157:58.94]So, I'll see you tomorrow.
[158:08.67]Take care of yourselves.
[158:09.25]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[158:10.09]Thanks for the raid, Vinny.
[158:11.01]And thanks, Vinny, for playing, too.
