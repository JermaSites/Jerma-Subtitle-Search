[02:04.57]I don't have a PS5, I don't have an Xbox, and it reminds me of an iguana with a little hat.
[02:22.37]Where's the ass emote?
[02:24.53]I don't think you can get that.
[02:25.39]Are these comments?
[02:29.65]Are these live comments?
[02:31.25]Yeah, dude.
[02:31.77]Gotta get my height calculated.
[02:38.27]No, I need to... Do you understand that conversation, how that goes?
[02:44.97]First of all, I don't tell my doctor that I'm like a fucking streamer.
[02:51.96]Uh, yeah, Mr. Elbertson, looking at your chart here.
[02:54.18]Oh, by the way, I'm a Twitch streamer.
[02:56.64]Okay, don't care.
[02:57.86]I don't fucking care about that at all.
[02:59.94]Uh, it says here that you're having some stomach problems.
[03:02.27]Why would I do that?
[03:02.91]No, I don't want to be like, hey, can you take, like, a video from, like, my audience?
[03:06.67]That's automatic you're a douchebag.
[03:08.45]Like, that's automatic shithead.
[03:11.59]Hey, Doc, I know we got something.
[03:13.29]Hey, ready?
[03:13.91]Get me in frame.
[03:14.90]Oh, shit, I knocked something off.
[03:15.94]What was that?
[03:17.62]That's okay.
[03:18.54]Nothing in there.
[03:19.84]Get me in frame, Doc.
[03:21.49]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[03:22.41]It's me, Jerma.
[03:23.23]Hey, why don't you measure me, Doc?
[03:25.09]You don't want to be in the fucking video, but get over here.
[03:27.03]I don't care.
[03:29.01]No, I don't want to do that.
[03:34.65]I would not like to be on camera.
[03:37.27]It's cool, dude.
[03:38.11]It's cool, bro.
[03:38.59]Come on over here.
[03:39.49]Hey, this is my doctor.
[03:42.25]And I put my hand up, and I make a mouth with my hand.
[03:45.00]Hey, I went to school for medicine.
[03:47.68]And...
[03:55.68]I don't want to do that shit.
[04:00.32]I have to find somebody that will measure me.
[04:02.82]That isn't... That... I don't know.
[04:04.62]Maybe I'll just... I'm just gonna do it on the fucking wall.
[04:15.41]Oh, I am a doctor.
[04:16.31]Look at me.
[04:16.71]I am so smart.
[04:19.11]Now go ahead and stand over there, doc.
[04:20.13]And go ahead and put the tape measure up.
[04:23.83]Yeah, yeah.
[04:24.25]Right there.
[04:24.65]Right there.
[04:32.62]Hire someone on TaskRabbit?
[04:34.78]What the fuck is TaskRabbit?
[04:40.05]What about your CBD doctor?
[04:41.92]There's no CBD doctor.
[05:00.64]CBD doctor, yeah, any doctor can prescribe a medical marijuana license if they feel like it would help you.
[05:09.44]Or, you know, maybe a doctor wants to just, you know, in the office with you.
[05:19.05]Hey, man, I got this sweet, sweet Mary Jane.
[05:21.99]You want to give it a try?
[05:24.85]Oh, absolutely.
[05:25.83]I love this doctor.
[05:27.54]Hey.
[05:31.66]Hey, weren't you, weren't you having back problems or something?
[05:35.67]Yeah, man.
[05:36.55]My back's killing me.
[05:38.07]Alright.
[05:40.41]I'll get you an x-ray.
[05:51.12]There was a drug addict.
[05:53.68]No.
[05:57.55]Is this just you when you went to the doctor?
[06:01.09]No, I don't go to the... No, I... When I do marijuana products, I sit in my chair or I lie on the couch and just stare into the fucking wilderness.
[06:19.78]Or I play Hearthstone Battlegrounds, which I've gotten pretty good at, by the way.
[06:25.09]Alright, I gotta ask everybody.
[06:27.65]So I have, I'm gonna say a number out loud, and I want to know if it's any good, okay?
[06:35.58]This is my Battleground Hearthstone ranking number.
[06:39.52]Oh shit, no, I don't want to tell you this.
[06:41.59]Because specifically, you guys will specifically make your rank this number and queue every day to try and find me.
[06:48.79]No, never mind.
[06:50.01]It's high.
[06:50.25]Okay.
[06:53.56]What's his rank?
[06:54.10]Okay, I'm going to lose and win the amount of games it takes to be at that exact number.
[06:58.75]And I know he plays every night PST before bed.
[07:01.93]I'm going to find this motherfucker and I'm going to troll him.
[07:07.78]This is the Die Dallas encounter, as you can see in the top left.
[07:09.90]This is the first thing I'm going to play.
[07:10.82]This is 3DO Night.
[07:11.66]Welcome, everybody.
[07:14.10]This is like a 5 CD adventure game.
[07:20.47]That should uh, should be interesting.
[07:24.81]This is one of the ones we left on the table last time we played 3DO.
[07:30.41]Pause the stream, I have to make tortellini.
[07:31.93]We don't have like 12 minutes for you to do that.
[07:34.41]If you said microwave tortellini, sure.
[07:37.92]That's like a minute.
[07:40.22]Make tortellini, that's too long.
[07:45.68]Pause, pause, pause.
[07:48.79]No, I don't want to rush him because if you rush Tortellini, you're going to screw it all up.
[07:54.83]There's al dente and then there's no.
[07:57.18]Six minutes, five minutes, he's going to rush it and it's going to be chewy and he's going to be pissed at us.
[08:01.54]You can't rush pasta.
[08:03.12]And you can't have it for too long.
[08:06.78]Seven to eight minutes, take it out.
[08:08.13]I don't even care, just take it out.
[08:11.25]It doesn't look like it, take it out.
[08:14.27]Eight minutes, take it out.
[08:18.55]Seven minutes.
[08:19.05]Take it out.
[08:20.87]You heard me.
[08:21.29]I don't know.
[08:21.65]This feels kind of hard.
[08:23.21]Shut up and take it out.
[08:24.57]Take it out now.
[08:27.26]Okay.
[08:27.84]This looks terrible.
[08:31.04]It's not ready.
[08:31.64]It's not done, dude.
[08:32.80]Shut up.
[08:33.82]Just wait.
[08:34.20]I strained it.
[08:36.52]Okay.
[08:37.62]It looks a little springy.
[08:39.38]Try it.
[08:43.41]Oh.
[08:44.63]Oh, that's nice.
[08:46.99]Listen to me more often, okay?
[08:52.35]Seven minutes.
[08:54.43]What's wrong with you today?
[08:55.37]I am like in Jamaican, but I am like kind of weird today.
[09:02.28]I agree.
[09:03.40]What is wrong with me today?
[09:09.52]Are you stoned?
[09:11.98]No, stop.
[09:16.20]I hate how you guys can tell, by the way.
[09:20.52]Well, I mean, obviously, if I can't read an analog clock, that's a really good way to know.
[09:24.66]But no, I'm not.
[09:25.84]Are you ready to play?
[09:26.76]Let's go.
[09:27.20]Did I Dallas an encounter?
[09:32.02]I'm drinking a coffee right now.
[09:34.16]Relax.
[09:37.41]Here we go.
[09:39.07]In three, two, one, go.
[09:46.27]Wait for the pasta.
[09:47.18]No, I'm not waiting for pasta.
[09:48.74]That guy, he'll show up eventually.
[09:50.84]He's gonna rush into the room with this hot bowl of pasta.
[09:53.30]He's gonna burn himself.
[09:55.00]That's not my fault, by the way.
[09:56.16]I didn't tell you to do that.
[09:57.34]The year is 2135 AD.
[10:06.51]Planet Beta Trianguli 6.
[10:12.57]The final days of the first interstellar war.
[10:23.50]Oh, it's kind of, it's like Star Wars.
[10:24.66]Information people and keep alert.
[10:26.68]This sector is supposed to be crawling with Vakar fighters.
[10:29.40]KC, anything on the scanners?
[10:32.14]Are they setting up a coach?
[10:37.06]Never mind.
[10:38.30]Oh.
[10:38.44]We've got five Krakow class interceptors coming in hot and heavy, Kase.
[10:42.81]They're riding a ride at Disney.
[10:52.26]Get him!
[10:52.64]Why do they look like Burger King employees?
[11:10.00]He's got a Burger King hat on.
[11:13.66]Can we get out?
[11:23.73]Omega Lell got him.
[11:32.47]McDonald's versus Burger King, Interstellar War.
[11:35.60]Look, your ejection pod hit some debris.
[11:37.94]You got hit pretty bad, but the med techs are trying to fix you up with life support and artificial senses.
[11:43.51]You just hang in there, Casey, and you'll be okay.
[11:45.79]And when conglomerates get that big and McDonald's owns planets, it would be two months later.
[11:50.81]Audio link is activated.
[11:54.53]Cutting in visual in three, two, one.
[12:00.93]Wait, am I the ship?
[12:03.03]Switch on neural interface.
[12:04.83]You got it.
[12:07.13]Casey?
[12:09.49]It's Aerie.
[12:10.24]I'm the ship.
[12:11.48]Hi.
[12:13.75]ASMR you are a I can't even fucking say it you know what I'm saying Look at yourself
[12:41.14]Now, you may not look the same on the outside, but I know it's you on the inside.
[12:45.70]Oh.
[12:46.22]And we need to know if you can respond.
[12:47.72]I want to die.
[12:49.02]Use the virtual interface in front of you to transmit a yes.
[12:54.17]Don't be now, please.
[12:55.21]Don't be.
[12:55.99]Shoot me with a gun.
[12:56.67]Do you have a gun?
[12:58.15]Shoot me with a gun.
[12:58.87]Please.
[13:01.81]Wait, what?
[13:05.55]Interface help.
[13:08.25]Use the yes-no buttons to communicate.
[13:10.23]Perform analysis on certain objects.
[13:13.25]Use to send stored analysis data.
[13:16.34]Use to acquire loose objects.
[13:18.50]Activates a general-purpose floodlight.
[13:21.74]Activates your multi-light transmitter.
[13:23.66]Initiates the probe system.
[13:24.94]Performs system diagnostics.
[13:26.28]Launches your onboard probe.
[13:27.42]Boosts Casey's onboard thruster.
[13:32.92]Oh, shit.
[13:33.32]Okay.
[13:34.35]Activate virtual interfaces are.
[13:36.81]Select and navigate is that.
[13:38.33]Activate navigation control.
[13:40.27]I can fly around?
[13:44.07]Oh, this just got way more interesting.
[13:46.45]Okay, go and help.
[13:53.17]Oh, here we go.
[13:53.95]I can say yes and no.
[13:55.64]Should I say no?
[13:56.34]What did I just do?
[14:02.36]He didn't give me... No, don't shut me off!
[14:07.04]Shut it down?
[14:07.80]Did I just get one of the endings of the game by accidentally not doing anything?
[14:17.87]Shut him down.
[14:21.28]How long did it take to build that thing?
[14:32.51]And we need to know if you can respond.
[14:34.19]If you can, use the virtual interface in front of you to transmit a yes.
[14:42.05]Glad to see you still got your sense of humor.
[14:43.73]Yes, you probably haven't heard, but the war is over.
[14:48.69]We flamed their butts at Exeter 3.
[14:51.19]Vakkar lost a third of their fleet.
[14:53.03]They went running with their tails between their legs straight to the Taladarans, practically begged them to negotiate a peace treaty.
[14:59.46]We won.
[15:00.82]Stole.
[15:00.94]Stole.
[15:01.12]Stolen.
[15:01.28]Engine detected.
[15:01.72]Self destruct.
[15:25.49]We thought we'd help salvage some of the Vekar ships we helped disable.
[15:28.91]That's the very least we could do.
[15:29.93]The way we see it, there's a lot of very tasty salvage just floating around out there, right for the picture.
[15:37.17]Alright, now let's get really, really personal.
[15:38.76]And we figure you'd be interested in joining us.
[15:41.86]So we liberated you from the lab.
[15:45.24]Great question.
[15:45.98]Zach wired your interface.
[15:47.48]Are you two together?
[15:49.34]Are you dating?
[15:51.02]It's good to have you back, Casey.
[15:52.64]Are you two dating?
[15:54.51]So what do you say guys?
[15:56.47]Let's do some hunting.
[16:00.09]Oh, I can't do anything.
[16:02.75]It's reverse seaman.
[16:03.99]Yeah, I'm the one that responds.
[16:07.55]The Draylax system 50 hours later.
[16:13.60]So weird, why can't you save like?
[16:15.96]Two days, three days.
[16:16.90]50 hours.
[16:29.33]What's the point of this?
[16:29.93]What are we supposed to be doing?
[16:32.01]Alright, hard contact at 17,000 kilometers.
[16:34.26]Oh man, we've been poking around this sector for two days now.
[16:38.34]Maybe we finally got something.
[16:39.50]Activating view screens.
[16:41.02]Okay, we got something.
[16:43.36]We have to go out there and clear this?
[16:47.04]Hey, Case, what do you say?
[16:47.76]You want to take your new equipment for a test?
[16:49.58]Yeah, let's go.
[16:50.67]Why don't you go ahead and activate your remote control probe, Casey?
[16:53.35]See if you can get us a better look at this derelict.
[16:58.08]Probe.
[16:59.38]Where's the probe?
[17:00.24]Alright.
[17:04.75]Where's the probe data?
[17:06.73]Is this like oxygen?
[17:07.59]Alright.
[17:10.71]Did I just turn it into hydrogen?
[17:12.25]Oh, shit.
[17:13.25]Start up subs.
[17:17.84]Wait, wait.
[17:18.24]I need the help.
[17:23.02]Launches your onboard probe.
[17:25.80]Okay, here we go.
[17:26.32]The probe is down here.
[17:29.21]No.
[17:29.55]Probe.
[17:30.43]Data.
[17:31.69]Uh.
[17:32.64]Analyze.
[17:33.26]Yes.
[17:35.36]On.
[17:39.22]Okay.
[17:39.42]Grapple arm system.
[17:43.86]Um.
[17:46.39]Launch probe?
[17:47.75]What am I doing?
[17:53.05]All analysis system.
[17:56.15]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[17:59.94]Did I do it?
[18:06.47]What's happening?
[18:07.47]You didn't give me very good instructions.
[18:09.95]Analysis.
[18:10.49]What's the analysis one?
[18:11.35]Alright, analysis.
[18:12.79]Alright, put the probe on.
[18:15.69]Run your diagnostics.
[18:19.49]Run your diagnostics.
[18:22.39]Perform system diagnostics on the probe.
[18:24.75]Oh, it's this one.
[18:27.37]Alright, diagnostic signal.
[18:30.80]What do we got?
[18:33.32]Alright, launch probe.
[18:34.30]Diagnosing.
[18:40.25]What did it look like?
[18:41.19]Okay, at this point, you could have done it yourself.
[18:47.25]Why are you trying to get the toaster to do these very complicated tasks?
[18:54.40]Deploy the probe.
[19:01.64]It's me!
[19:13.53]Is that the Daedalus?
[19:22.20]I miss these old CG cutscenes.
[19:23.92]They look so strange and almost terrifying in a way.
[19:30.06]It's fucking horrible.
[19:31.54]It feels like shit.
[19:32.10]It's not even funny to joke about.
[19:33.56]Yes.
[19:33.64]Wait, what?
[19:33.94]Grab?
[19:34.18]What do I do?
[19:57.07]An ID check?
[19:58.39]Am I pulling him over?
[19:59.99]ID check.
[20:00.33]Which one is that?
[20:01.35]It's a... I can't read that.
[20:02.37]It's so blurry.
[20:02.77]What is it?
[20:03.79]You're pulling him over.
[20:26.66]You know how fast you were going.
[20:27.88]14 light years per day.
[20:32.86]This is a 12 light years per day zone.
[20:34.30]Come on, give me that one.
[20:35.44]Wait, wait, wait.
[20:35.84]I missed all of that.
[20:36.96]It said... Wait, can you...
[20:58.85]booby-trapped the hulls Casey I warned you about traps you just blew our only probe now we have to go back and start all over again thank you it looks so sad he's dead thank God you could just start from right here though
[21:28.43]Okay, so this is a booby trap.
[21:30.51]Alright, analyze.
[21:32.61]Collect- use the floodlight.
[21:35.25]Put the thrusters up.
[21:36.79]Launch the probe.
[21:43.63]What?
[21:49.79]I'm like a dog that gets the paper towel roll.
[21:54.91]Put that down!
[21:56.29]No, I'm not gonna put it down.
[21:57.23]Give me that!
[21:58.93]And then you get it back, and then somehow he gets it again.
[22:01.31]Hey, hey!
[22:10.94]Oh, bad computer.
[22:11.90]It's the dotted line?
[22:20.76]Okay, do I have a device I can use?
[22:22.56]Just pull the plug in the hole.
[22:23.94]I mean, what about over here?
[22:49.54]I can't, like, do anything.
[22:52.89]I can't analyze any data.
[22:54.01]I can't attach.
[22:54.93]I can't grab.
[22:56.03]I can't fling.
[22:57.23]I can't scream.
[22:59.43]Bullet hole.
[23:00.57]This down here, right?
[23:02.05]I can't activate it.
[23:03.03]I can't activate this either.
[23:04.08]Is there anything else I can grab?
[23:09.46]I can touch this.
[23:15.42]Casey, I warned you about traps.
[23:18.12]You just blew our only probe.
[23:20.15]Now we have to go back and start all over again.
[23:22.57]Thank you.
[23:28.03]Does anybody understand yet?
[23:31.90]I warned you about... Yeah, it's booby trapped.
[23:33.54]So should I just leave?
[23:34.76]Can I not open it?
[23:38.94]I can touch this.
[23:39.70]I can touch this.
[23:41.06]And I can touch this.
[23:43.81]Nothing else can be grabbed.
[23:47.64]A dotted line.
[23:48.58]I'd already grabbed that.
[23:50.90]Wait, what about like... Wait!
[23:54.24]What the fuck?
[23:54.62]My UV light?
[23:54.98]I tried to activate it.
[23:57.16]She warned you about traps.
[24:12.29]yeah well not good enough you can't just say oh hey uh this this is trapped why don't you tell me what device to use where should I go by the way a shitty alchemist blames their tools right whatever the I am their creation so they are controlling me in a way so therefore like you a shitty blacksmith blames their tools
[24:41.46]Alright, UV light.
[24:45.84]Nope.
[24:50.09]I can't talk.
[24:50.65]There's no data to analyze.
[24:51.89]Wait, let me see.
[24:56.89]Performance analysis.
[24:58.33]Wait, wait, hold on.
[24:59.29]Analysis.
[25:01.75]Nope.
[25:03.56]Carpenter, you idiot.
[25:04.56]Blacksmith does it too.
[25:06.48]Come on.
[25:07.40]Name a guy that uses tools.
[25:09.82]You could say a dentist is the same way.
[25:17.05]A craftsman.
[25:17.63]There it is.
[25:17.97]Alright.
[25:19.71]Builder.
[25:20.21]Yeah, right, right, right.
[25:24.85]What do I touch?
[25:26.65]I'm not going to get softlocked here.
[25:28.49]I haven't even been in the game for 10 minutes.
[25:38.49]I can't use the grab hand.
[25:42.64]Wait, what's that?
[25:46.60]Activate navigation control.
[25:50.98]No.
[25:53.44]Just get a guide.
[25:55.50]This actress is from Wayne's World.
[25:57.16]Yes, yes.
[25:58.39]She was very, very famous back in the 90s.
[26:02.88]Anyone have any idea what's going on here?
[26:05.42]Read the manual, you dipshit.
[26:06.96]What?
[26:07.22]The fucking manual?
[26:10.62]What?
[26:16.31]There's no manual.
[26:17.07]There's just a... Please send products and other correspondence to this... It's a Panasonic thing in here.
[26:24.39]It's like a... It's smart to register.
[26:25.85]This is more than a product registration card.
[26:27.45]It's your key to a new and exciting Panasonic product.
[26:29.70]I don't have a manual.
[26:36.31]Hold on, wait, there's one here.
[26:39.13]Okay.
[26:40.39]Ship's log.
[26:42.48]Encounter.
[26:45.10]Welcome to the encounter.
[26:46.26]Step one is virtual control.
[26:47.62]Step two is to probe and then diagnostics.
[26:51.18]Step three, analysis of the ship.
[26:54.78]Blow the hatch!
[26:55.64]You'll need to use your laser torch to open the cargo door.
[26:58.79]When your laser arms itself, aim it on the upper left door controls.
[27:01.75]Why is this just a guide?
[27:04.60]This is just a guide how to do every fucking puzzle in the game.
[27:17.31]Where's the laser torch?
[27:22.57]I don't have a laser torch.
[27:23.81]What the hell is that talking about?
[27:29.39]Hold on.
[27:29.87]Okay.
[27:31.31]Die Dallas.
[27:32.65]Encounter.
[27:33.65]Walkthrough.
[27:37.03]Click the blue thing near the door.
[27:38.53]Are you fucking kidding me?
[27:50.69]Really?
[27:50.95]I can do that.
[27:51.33]Whoa!
[27:51.43]Scary!
[27:52.13]Actually, they did kind of scare me.
[28:04.30]Really happy for you, Casey.
[28:05.64]Let's get a good look around this place.
[28:07.48]Alright.
[28:08.42]What are we looking for?
[28:09.18]Aliens.
[28:09.32]Floodlight.
[28:10.75]Activate.
[28:34.25]What if I looked all the way down and there was just two shoes and legs?
[28:37.09]I don't see anything.
[28:44.36]Analyze.
[28:46.64]Analyze the current environment.
[28:48.86]Launch the probe.
[28:49.48]Alright, analyzing.
[29:03.91]The ship fucking blows.
[29:07.75]Yeah, this actually sucks.
[29:11.17]It's just a giant hallway.
[29:12.73]Where's the kitchen?
[29:15.36]Where's the sleeping quarters?
[29:17.60]You just float around in here?
[29:18.78]Or do you go to the bathroom?
[29:24.94]It's just a tube.
[29:29.83]And you know something?
[29:30.57]Wait, what's that?
[29:31.99]TV shows and movies get this fucking wrong every time, don't they?
[29:36.94]Anytime there's an alien spacecraft or an unknown encounter, right?
[29:41.64]It's always like this.
[29:43.14]It's never like a kitchen.
[29:43.87]They never show the cook.
[29:46.91]There's never a kitchen.
[29:47.89]There's never a living room.
[29:48.95]It's always just weird and how abnormal.
[29:55.08]There's no bedrooms.
[29:58.69]Scary ship is just scary ship.
[30:01.23]There's no actual rooms.
[30:09.14]He's so high.
[30:10.06]Alright, analyzing.
[30:11.90]Gonna be some kind of magical power.
[30:29.50]Wait, I just throw it down the hallway?
[30:43.93]Didn't she just say that it belongs with the dead?
[30:45.95]I'm just gonna toss it down the hall.
[30:48.25]It's kind of disrespectful.
[30:59.11]This whole sector is picked.
[31:00.53]Why not, like, put it with this body?
[31:02.55]I agree.
[31:03.49]But where?
[31:03.99]The Magellan cluster?
[31:07.15]Why, just frisbee it down the hall?
[31:08.67]Oh, not there.
[31:09.80]What I was thinking about, remember that time we surprised the hell out of that wing of that car cruiser to sleep at the wheel?
[31:17.42]Yeah, Mizar system, right?
[31:19.12]Yeah, and I never saw so many ejection pods in my life.
[31:22.40]I feel like such a third wheel right now.
[31:23.90]You want to go back to Mizar?
[31:25.89]Not only am I third wheel in this current friend group, they turned me into a fucking task robot.
[31:32.36]That's extra third wheel.
[31:33.50]Welcome home, dear.
[31:46.57]Casey, you're back.
[31:47.25]Look, I say we take a vote.
[31:48.81]Who's for going to Mizar?
[31:50.93]What is it?
[31:51.39]Food?
[31:52.05]Yes.
[31:52.77]Come on, Airy.
[31:53.57]It's not like it's in Vakara space.
[31:55.75]It's a buffer zone.
[31:57.33]10 community subs came in from the Fuli.
[31:59.87]Thank you, Fuli, for the 10 community subs.
[32:03.13]Yeah.
[32:03.79]Welcome all the new subs.
[32:05.41]Thanks, the subs.
[32:06.97]I don't know why I let you talk me into these things.
[32:09.82]Let me talk you into something else.
[32:11.74]Talk me into something else?
[32:13.12]Hey, Case, what do you say?
[32:14.60]Mizar?
[32:17.68]Yes.
[32:19.52]Talk me into something else.
[32:22.36]I mean, we got this robot.
[32:23.64]Yeah, we're going this way.
[32:24.88]Stop the train.
[32:25.58]Make him sing.
[32:27.66]I don't sing.
[32:28.30]So, I don't know.
[32:49.78]Alright, tutorial over.
[32:52.54]We're going story branching here.
[32:54.15]We could have said no.
[32:59.85]Wait, what?
[33:05.26]Yeah, instead of like zirking off, you probably should have been watching the out your windshield.
[33:19.00]No!
[33:20.14]Uh... Analyze the situation.
[33:24.92]Analyze it.
[33:26.40]Oh, God damn it.
[33:27.76]Give me a fucking break.
[33:29.26]What?
[33:30.18]No, why?
[33:31.54]Why?
[33:32.06]Why are you in this?
[33:33.36]I don't want you in here.
[33:34.42]I don't want you to do this.
[33:35.52]I don't want to do this game.
[33:36.40]I don't want to do this one.
[33:40.38]Why is this here?
[33:41.22]It better not be timed.
[33:43.48]Okay, what do I... Okay, power.
[33:46.22]Power grid.
[33:52.44]They both just took WWE into the turnbuckle move.
[33:56.22]Pratt Falls must hurry and save the ship.
[34:08.50]Is this what it wants?
[34:11.58]Power?
[34:13.68]Okay, power one.
[34:15.88]Power two.
[34:17.22]Power three.
[34:20.13]Did I do it?
[34:20.81]Connect multiple systems failure.
[34:22.37]Where's the other one?
[34:26.07]Is this one?
[34:26.49]Is this one up here?
[34:27.45]Is that one up there?
[34:28.43]Is that it?
[34:33.77]Did I do it?
[34:34.41]Is that it?
[34:34.67]I think that's it.
[34:36.81]All four sides.
[34:39.49]Well... Shit.
[34:41.64]Okay, hold on.
[34:43.76]Fuck.
[34:50.12]Damn it.
[34:50.48]Alright, so this has to go... I fucking can't believe this shit is in here right now.
[34:58.66]Oh, that was right.
[34:59.46]But then how do I get this one?
[35:22.50]I fucking hate these things.
[35:24.72]I hate these.
[35:26.26]Why of all the things does it have to be a light puzzle?
[35:29.96]What happened?
[35:37.05]I- why?
[35:37.93]I hate these things.
[35:51.87]If you told me that I was gonna have to do light puzzles, like turn the pipe shit again, I would have shit my pants on camera instead.
[36:16.73]Not too late to do that.
[36:17.97]No, it is too late.
[36:26.00]No!
[36:29.55]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[36:42.88]I fucking hate this shit.
[37:04.58]No!
[37:23.09]God damn it!
[37:24.17]It has to connect to this one, but I can't get that one to do what I want it to do.
[37:38.41]Work backwards, work backwards.
[37:39.59]Hurry before the time runs out.
[37:40.81]Up, this way, down.
[37:42.79]Oh my fucking god, I hate this more than anything.
[37:53.09]Calm down and concentrate.
[37:54.33]I'm gonna... How about I calm down or concentrate or drop kick 3DO through my hallway.
[38:00.21]Fuck, which one of those?
[38:01.11]Both sound pretty good to me right now.
[38:49.93]That's not it.
[38:50.53]Okay, analyze.
[38:52.61]Say no.
[38:54.03]No.
[38:54.87]No.
[38:55.43]No.
[38:56.11]No.
[38:56.95]No.
[38:57.15]I can't wait for one to turn to the camera and there's one small scratch on the forehead with a tiny bit of blood.
[39:10.81]They're gonna blame me.
[39:21.25]Mary, scanners only pick up metal and rock.
[39:24.17]This thing must be made of something else.
[39:26.23]Ah, shit.
[39:27.05]Every one of our transistors is down.
[39:29.09]They were asleep.
[39:31.13]They didn't even crash and get hurt.
[39:32.45]Want to hear the the good news or the bad news?
[39:41.53]Uh, good news.
[39:42.33]Bad news first.
[39:42.83]What are you, crazy?
[39:43.87]Bad news is this thing's hurtling straight for the sun's Corona.
[39:48.58]It's taking us with it.
[39:50.69]We can do it.
[39:51.17]That's me.
[39:51.45]See, they don't know but this argument is going up to the Amazon cloud and they don't even know.
[40:16.31]Casey, why don't you run an ID check?
[40:18.19]See if there's any known ship with a configuration like that.
[40:23.75]ID check.
[40:28.95]Seems to be of some type of composite material.
[40:31.79]Surprise, unknown.
[40:34.39]Any response to our distress call?
[40:37.13]Zip, dead air.
[40:39.78]So, either we figure out how to alter our course.
[40:43.54]We're toast.
[40:45.02]In about four hours.
[40:47.29]I hope that we eat Zack first.
[40:56.99]Okay.
[40:58.21]Oh, that's not the probe.
[41:06.45]Alright, probe on.
[41:09.10]Get ready to launch probe.
[41:12.80]Launching probe.
[41:17.17]Keep voice.
[41:18.81]I will, but when I need it.
[41:20.75]Propulsion systems activated.
[41:24.29]Analysis system activated.
[41:26.45]Launch probe.
[41:29.61]Probe.
[41:30.91]Ready.
[41:34.20]Probe.
[41:40.08]Analyzing data.
[41:41.82]Sending probe now.
[41:43.34]In three, two, one.
[41:48.46]Zero.
[41:49.47]I just said that.
[41:51.93]Stop trying to overstep me.
[41:55.87]Always needing to one-up me is no way to continue further our relationship.
[42:10.82]Be careful out there.
[42:14.92]Get a better robot voice.
[42:16.34]Is it not good?
[42:16.88]I don't even know what it is.
[42:17.76]I can't even tell.
[42:22.27]Oh, we're stuck in it.
[42:22.87]There's a big black hole here.
[42:26.67]Do a fart with the robot filter.
[42:28.29]Alright, this better be worth like 5 million from that one guy.
[42:44.66]I don't even know what it sounds like.
[42:46.77]This looks like a cake.
[42:47.83]Is this even a ship?
[42:50.19]This is a fucking calzone.
[42:52.13]What is this?
[43:06.52]Yeah.
[43:07.14]Neither have I. Right.
[43:07.78]Wait, did she say galaxies full of unknowns, my young son?
[43:10.15]Is that what she said?
[43:32.38]Yeah, I remember hearing that the miners sunk a shaft right into the main colony.
[43:37.29]Practically wiped out the whole race before that exolinguist established communications.
[43:41.17]Yeah, well, let's be careful because you're no exolinguist.
[43:43.97]Hey, hey, I happen to speak 27 languages.
[43:46.25]Yeah, three phrases.
[43:48.03]More beer, where's the head, and if you want to come by and see me.
[43:51.37]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:52.55]Thank you for your order.
[43:53.47]I have placed a six pack of beer on your Amazon account.
[43:57.61]No, no, dude, what the fuck, Alexa?
[44:00.51]I'm going in.
[44:01.29]Wait, they're going in.
[44:02.85]They've been computer generated.
[44:05.58]Those aren't even real faces anymore.
[44:38.87]That's not video footage.
[44:40.15]That's actually 3D in the game.
[44:43.01]Spy Kids.
[44:43.25]Spy Kids 3D.
[44:51.82]Hahaha.
[45:01.17]Almost looks like it was alive once, doesn't it?
[45:04.49]Yeah, it's nice to know the old galaxy's still here.
[45:05.87]You gotta be careful.
[45:06.69]If you thrust too much, you'll just incinerate the person behind you.
[45:12.57]Where's the gravity field?
[45:13.73]Where is this gravity field?
[45:14.99]Hey, come on, Harry.
[45:17.48]This is just like the old days, isn't it?
[45:19.80]They're gonna go soaring into space.
[45:22.72]Oh, come on.
[45:23.42]Tell me you don't find this stuff exciting anymore.
[45:27.14]The only thing that excites me is staying alive.
[45:32.41]Oh, but don't forget me.
[45:33.65]Let's take off.
[45:37.95]Can I shine my light in there?
[45:41.15]Okay.
[45:41.33]I will.
[45:41.73]I will do the one or two buttons I've been able to press this entire game.
[46:02.27]What do you see?
[46:06.93]This looks actually pretty scary in here.
[46:10.98]There's fluid on the wall.
[46:16.66]What is that?
[46:17.84]See that?
[46:19.34]What's that?
[46:20.25]It's like a tail.
[46:32.17]Is it gonna be facehuggers?
[46:34.63]I feel so like not needed
[47:01.47]Why am I just the Peter Dinklage ghost that they re-recorded all his lines?
[47:06.13]What's his name?
[47:08.27]I just come up with tutorial messages every, like, five hours.
[47:11.95]Actual side character.
[47:13.45]I can't even say yes and no.
[47:14.59]No offense, Casey.
[47:32.46]This is a pretty good DVD menu game.
[47:42.13]It is a DVD menu.
[47:44.29]It is a DVD.
[47:45.69]This is just the special features on Prometheus.
[47:47.99]Alright, what does it want me to do?
[47:51.43]Grab it?
[47:55.37]Analyze.
[47:55.97]That is basically the 3D.
[47:56.75]Oh, yeah.
[48:03.92]Something in there.
[48:04.40]There's an egg in there.
[48:05.06]There's an egg in there.
[48:09.82]There's an egg!
[48:12.94]Come on.
[48:16.24]Please insert disk two.
[48:20.79]Oh shit, this is disk four right here.
[48:30.69]Alright, hold on.
[48:31.35]It's not gonna break, right?
[48:34.72]DVD game Alright disk two in What did I just press?
[48:42.89]I did like a code blue.
[48:45.49]What is that?
[48:45.95]Okay, so now what?
[49:01.74]I'll just say, now insert disk one.
[49:03.38]Just needed to load the video into cache.
[49:06.73]You got it!
[49:07.43]I did it!
[49:07.69]There's a brain in here.
[49:14.13]Oh, great.
[49:22.00]Great, now we're stuck in here.
[49:26.86]Aw, boy.
[49:27.06]Where are you going?
[49:30.40]Oh, that's not even me.
[49:32.84]Put your face in there.
[49:33.94]I wonder what this is.
[49:39.77]She takes the helmet off and sticks her head in it.
[49:42.05]Take it off.
[49:42.33]Wait, they're actually going to take these off.
[50:04.37]It does not seem like a very firm seal.
[50:06.37]The disk tray on the fucking 3DO is more firm seal than that is.
[50:10.45]It's okay.
[50:10.69]A little damp, though.
[50:16.87]What do you think you're doing?
[50:17.89]I'm gonna ditch the Isu.
[50:20.05]Let's take this down to procedure, Zack.
[50:22.39]Oh, God.
[50:23.13]He's taking the whole suit off?
[50:24.67]Commander Ariel B. Matheson, first squadron, retired.
[50:27.95]They didn't feel like animating that anymore.
[50:30.77]Too much 3D work.
[50:31.73]Make better time with that one.
[50:36.87]Why is she still 3D?
[50:46.71]She's still... Oh, no, no, no.
[50:48.57]Okay.
[50:49.65]Now they're not anymore.
[50:50.49]I don't think it knows what a gun is.
[51:07.61]Why would you touch this?
[51:08.75]What are you doing?
[51:10.27]This doesn't know what a gun is.
[51:11.39]This is not the Triceratops from Jurassic Park.
[51:15.01]Cringe.
[51:15.49]Oh, what you just said was so cringe.
[51:17.85]Thousands of piranhas.
[51:38.91]See that was a last-ditch communication like tell my wife I love her We have no idea
[52:03.70]That could have been the password.
[52:04.50]That could have been like the password to the laptop that has all the BTC on it from like fucking 2004.
[52:08.10]We'll never know.
[52:20.31]I don't think this thing's dead.
[52:24.07]No, it's not.
[52:25.35]It's wagging its tail.
[52:26.93]Did we just get duped?
[52:33.00]This just really is what it's like to be a side character.
[52:35.20]Like a party member that gives advice sometimes that doesn't do any of the game playing.
[52:41.55]You just kind of walk around and look at walls and stuff.
[53:11.08]Careful.
[53:13.74]I have my list of tutorial messages I can show up.
[53:19.54]Uh... Did you know that if you press tab you can get to the map?
[53:27.92]Me?
[53:28.08]Me?
[53:28.14]Me?
[53:28.24]You want me?
[53:33.77]Go ahead, Casey.
[53:34.39]See if you can make it through.
[53:42.45]Come on, go.
[53:43.48]Squeeze in there.
[53:48.12]I found the heart.
[53:49.56]There's gonna be some kind of jewel in here.
[53:50.80]We're gonna take the jewel in Indiana Jones style.
[53:52.46]The whole thing's gonna collapse.
[53:55.25]Oh, pods.
[53:56.23]This is where they grow their larvae.
[54:10.21]Alexa.
[54:17.35]I was just gonna yell, like, Alexa, order this, but I... It was a joke, like, as if it's here, but it's not here, and I can say that out loud.
[54:24.07]But I don't want to say that out loud, because some of you might actually have it.
[54:27.19]And you might... I might be on your TV speakers.
[54:30.53]So, I can't do that, either.
[54:31.73]Alexa, order of jewel pods.
[54:40.10]What's that?
[54:42.46]Jewel Pods.
[54:43.70]There's a crab in there.
[54:45.25]What?
[54:45.49]Oh.
[55:09.35]Oh, uh, yeah, I'm, um, no.
[55:13.45]Guess we better try another one of these doors.
[55:16.71]Yeah.
[55:19.09]Hey, Casey, let's try this one.
[55:26.85]Slow robot.
[55:29.01]Come on, give me a break.
[55:29.83]They built me with parts that they had lying around.
[55:31.79]How many, like, random graphics cards do you still have in your closet?
[55:35.82]What's going on?
[55:36.14]I thought Casey was the only one that could open these.
[55:38.92]Guys, I held on to a GTX 270 for like six fucking years.
[55:45.71]Sorry, I don't have the latest hardware built into this guy.
[55:55.11]Why?
[55:55.39]I don't know.
[55:56.07]Just in case I needed it for something.
[55:57.09]I don't have it anymore.
[56:01.69]It's gone now.
[56:03.78]Get a load of these things.
[56:05.91]I hold on to a lot of computer hardware like you're supposed to hold on to your tax returns.
[56:09.71]Seven years.
[56:11.35]And then I get rid of it.
[56:13.21]Oh my god, why are you drinking like the random acid?
[56:18.91]What?
[56:20.57]What?
[56:21.59]The fuck?
[56:22.47]Why did you walk up to a random... What the hell are you looking at, Cyclops?
[56:37.43]What is happening?
[56:39.27]What is happening in this game?
[56:41.51]Is this turning into an SNL skit?
[56:44.09]Hey!
[57:09.18]All of a sudden I'm R2-D2?
[57:10.30]So let me, okay, I gotta break this down.
[57:14.58]Let me get this straight.
[57:15.14]Guy walks into room in an alien spacecraft and it's all this weird shit around it.
[57:19.70]Immediately drinks out of the first liquid that you find.
[57:23.46]The first thing that's holding liquid.
[57:24.66]You just start drinking it.
[57:27.91]Is this a D&D campaign?
[57:29.95]With new players?
[57:36.51]Look at this, Harry.
[57:37.31]There's no sign of any weapons whatsoever.
[57:39.51]These guys didn't even put up a fight.
[57:42.41]Maybe they didn't have any weapons.
[57:44.82]Oh, come on.
[57:45.50]They built a spaceship.
[57:46.96]You enter a room with a strange fountain.
[57:49.68]And inside... I drank out of the fountain!
[57:51.66]Okay.
[57:54.66]Okay, roll, I guess.
[57:56.48]Yeah, well, they're real peaceful now.
[58:04.65]Look up ahead.
[58:06.76]Another door.
[58:08.44]Yeah, but this one is different.
[58:16.56]Roll for hydration.
[58:18.74]Oh, here we go.
[58:19.61]This is the room now.
[58:21.63]Oh, we really did it now.
[58:23.01]People are porting into here.
[58:26.85]Get the weapons ready.
[58:28.67]What do I have?
[58:29.11]I have robot fork penis.
[58:31.97]I'm ready.
[58:33.19]Looks like some kind of central hub.
[58:36.64]Well, they're not porting in.
[58:38.00]What are they doing?
[58:39.33]Why am I so interested in this game still?
[58:42.49]I kind of am.
[58:42.95]Don't you want to know what's happening?
[58:45.39]I kind of want to know the story.
[58:46.73]I want to know.
[59:20.51]I'm getting a little invested.
[59:21.49]Yeah, me too.
[59:29.21]So this must be the Didalis.
[59:30.45]Did I say something?
[59:35.08]That one.
[59:49.59]Oh, no.
[59:50.77]It's gonna be a puzzle.
[59:52.57]Okay.
[59:54.49]W-O-I... Walk?
[60:01.39]Walt?
[60:05.03]Analyze the door.
[60:06.99]Okay, it looks like there is a dial in there.
[60:14.19]It's gonna be a puzzle something, maybe.
[60:17.48]Alien pattern found.
[60:19.08]Chroma symbols.
[60:21.88]Take a look at this.
[60:25.02]Possible language.
[60:28.88]Take a look at that data.
[60:31.12]Okay, can I open it?
[60:32.70]What else can we do?
[60:33.16]Enhance it?
[60:37.16]It's a PlayStation language.
[60:46.82]Yeah, it is.
[60:47.82]Okay, I have the data.
[60:54.92]Now, should I go back?
[60:58.23]I've got... Hey!
[60:59.19]Yes!
[60:59.89]I found something.
[61:03.91]Okay, so this is... What's this look like?
[61:08.47]Now, can I move this around?
[61:11.61]Analyze it again.
[61:13.51]Press the button.
[61:15.15]I can't press anything.
[61:17.08]Press no.
[61:17.66]I have this.
[61:18.34]This is a color scheme.
[61:21.04]And an alien language.
[61:22.08]But can I go back and say, hey, I found something.
[61:25.00]Use your fork.
[61:26.94]Use the rainbow.
[61:28.47]Oh, shit!
[61:30.29]Okay.
[61:31.73]Uh, beige, orange, pink.
[61:35.17]Beige.
[61:36.45]Orange.
[61:38.47]Oh, my goodness.
[61:40.05]Orange.
[61:42.10]Oh, okay.
[61:43.00]Um...
[61:48.05]What is it doing?
[61:48.47]I have to make?
[61:58.70]What do I have to make?
[62:06.76]One of those symbols?
[62:08.38]I don't know what symbol I'm supposed to make.
[62:10.18]Just complete the whole thing.
[62:18.52]Like that?
[62:20.18]Hold on.
[62:21.86]Hold on.
[62:22.56]Okay, hold on.
[62:27.33]Alright.
[62:28.13]Thank you.
[62:28.87]It's not it?
[62:50.22]Shit.
[62:50.74]I'm missing the top right.
[63:31.73]Up right.
[63:32.23]Use top right.
[63:33.07]I can't.
[63:39.55]Robot, stop.
[63:40.33]Robot, stop.
[63:40.83]What?
[63:40.95]What are you talking about?
[63:41.80]I'm supposed to just make the whole thing, right?
[63:43.80]This is weird.
[63:52.54]That's not it?
[63:53.26]Fuck.
[63:55.82]It's so close.
[63:56.82]Fill the lines.
[63:59.18]Yeah, it's close.
[64:00.46]It's close.
[64:03.11]It's so close, but not really.
[64:05.77]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[64:07.26]That's that one.
[64:08.80]Then we gotta go... Hold on.
[64:14.92]Okay, then which one of these can go to the bottom right?
[64:17.56]Wait, hold on.
[64:29.25]No, that stays there.
[64:31.01]I need one to go across.
[64:35.11]Like that.
[64:35.71]And then I need this one to go this way.
[64:37.85]And then I need... Shit, this sucks.
[64:43.66]I just said sucks, and I didn't even mean to.
[64:45.74]I had it.
[64:53.70]I did, but I almost... Wait, hold on.
[65:02.57]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[65:14.64]Shit, it's this one little section down here that I can't do.
[65:29.71]That, and then that, and then... No, this one is definitely down here, right?
[65:38.75]It has to be.
[65:40.09]I had it.
[65:47.25]Wait.
[65:49.49]Ugh.
[65:53.23]No!
[66:01.85]No!
[66:02.77]Ugh!
[66:05.53]Oh, I have to do it again.
[66:06.68]I don't want to do it again.
[66:11.22]What?
[66:11.86]Okay, um.
[66:18.64]Oh lord, this is gonna be hell.
[66:20.48]This is gonna be horrible.
[66:29.06]I need one that goes this way.
[66:30.90]Okay?
[66:31.68]Alright, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on.
[66:36.94]Alright, wait, wait, wait, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[66:44.77]I need...
[66:52.57]Shit.
[66:54.08]Shit.
[66:54.56]Shit.
[66:55.84]Shit.
[66:56.06]One IQ...
[67:23.23]Don't even, what do you mean one IQ?
[67:24.87]This shit is fucking weird.
[67:26.09]Don't one IQ me.
[67:40.80]Oh, you motherfucker.
[67:42.08]It's so close.
[67:56.21]No!
[67:58.21]No!
[67:58.85]This one line!
[68:01.93]Fuck!
[68:02.51]I need one in the middle.
[69:13.68]I don't know.
[69:14.58]I'm just cheating.
[69:18.50]I'm cheating.
[69:18.84]I don't care.
[69:19.30]This is stupid.
[69:20.89]I'm not doing this like Saturday morning, Sunday morning paper bullshit puzzle.
[69:25.41]It's stupid.
[69:29.83]That doesn't tell you how to beat it.
[69:38.12]No, it just tells you that it exists.
[69:42.56]It's simple.
[69:44.42]It's not simple.
[69:45.83]It's stupid.
[69:47.05]I hate it.
[69:55.72]Wait, maybe it is simple.
[69:56.44]Hold on.
[70:33.40]Just press them all fast.
[70:42.93]Hold on.
[70:43.57]I think I got it.
[70:44.55]I think I got it.
[70:45.15]I got it.
[70:45.71]I got it.
[70:45.99]I got it.
[70:46.31]I got it.
[70:46.59]I got it.
[70:46.93]I got it.
[70:47.57]Just relax.
[70:49.43]Relax.
[70:58.90]This walkthrough doesn't work.
[71:01.46]Come on, the walkthrough king!
[71:03.26]He's gonna get me.
[71:08.89]Purple door.
[71:09.87]What?
[71:10.19]This isn't even... What the fuck?
[71:17.00]None of these... These are all... They don't even make any sense.
[71:23.30]They're all... This one's not even a paragraph long.
[71:29.23]I beat this puzzle when I was four.
[71:30.35]You didn't even own a 3DO.
[71:31.59]None of you did.
[71:32.09]The 3DO, like, sold 400 copies.
[71:33.91]You're not one of them.
[71:35.81]It's randomized.
[71:37.29]No, it's not.
[71:42.12]Wait.
[71:44.22]Oh, here we go.
[71:44.64]There's a play.
[71:45.16]Hold on.
[71:45.52]Let's walk through.
[71:56.77]I don't even- I hate it!
[72:00.15]Where's the- Just- It's just not even a puzzle.
[72:05.79]Alright, the Die Dallas encounter walkthrough part 2.
[72:12.16]Dude, all these- Where is this part of the fucking game?
[72:34.90]Oh, it's on part four.
[72:35.70]Okay.
[72:37.36]Match each one.
[72:38.56]I know.
[72:38.86]I know it's probably easy, but, like, I'd rather fucking eat the disk than do this.
[72:42.62]Alright.
[72:48.00]Got it.
[72:48.22]I got it.
[72:48.44]I got it.
[72:48.68]I got it.
[72:52.89]Wake up.
[72:55.17]Wait.
[72:55.47]What?
[72:55.75]This is...
[72:59.18]No, I just skipped to the next video.
[73:01.04]Why is YouTube?
[73:02.62]Fuck YouTube.
[73:03.70]Why is next video two pixels away from the play button?
[73:08.18]Fucking move that shit.
[73:09.30]Your website sucks.
[73:19.88]This walkthrough doesn't even have this part because it's on easy.
[73:22.92]This walkthrough I'm watching is on easy, so it only has the first part.
[73:33.08]The only reason why we have part two is because the game's on medium.
[73:38.56]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[73:47.23]God damn it, not even the walkthrough can help me.
[73:49.59]This walkthrough's on easy.
[73:52.71]You had it.
[73:53.67]Move the bottom left one.
[74:02.03]No, no, no, no, no, what do you mean no?
[74:03.55]What happened?
[74:04.69]Top left, the top left one.
[74:08.17]Oh, no, I don't wanna do it again.
[74:12.51]I don't wanna do it again.
[74:21.17]That one wasn't even hard.
[74:34.45]No, but fuck you too.
[74:35.57]Fuck your dumb site.
[74:36.77]Oh, let's put the play button right next to the skip button.
[74:39.15]That's a good idea.
[74:40.09]Why not?
[74:43.76]You know, I just noticed something.
[74:45.60]You give an awful lot of orders for civilian.
[74:48.96]I do outrank you.
[74:50.56]You did outrank me.
[74:51.60]And the only reason you did was because you were a lot better at kissing ass than I was.
[74:56.60]Everything I got, I earned the hard way.
[74:58.88]Just because you kept getting busted for insubordination.
[75:01.06]Oh, hey, hey, I know what you're talking about, okay?
[75:02.90]You know that wasn't my fault.
[75:04.34]Oh, the hell it wasn't?
[75:05.40]You went out of your way to disobey the orders.
[75:07.62]You never could accept ranking authority.
[75:09.60]Wait, let me explain something to you, okay?
[75:13.19]If I take an order from you, it's because I choose to.
[75:16.37]Got it?
[75:19.43]Man.
[75:24.21]Where the hell are you going?
[75:25.03]What, is she pissed at you too?
[75:27.82]I really am R2.
[75:31.88]Another door puzzle.
[75:32.76]I don't want to do another door puzzle.
[75:50.16]Let's try this way.
[75:54.50]You play as the camera.
[75:57.10]Oh, this room looks interesting.
[75:58.50]It's red and there's goop.
[76:15.11]Do an R2-D2 scream.
[76:16.89]I did that like two days ago.
[76:18.22]What was that?
[76:22.23]I don't know, but it's coming from over there.
[76:25.21]Boss fight.
[76:26.77]Crinn!
[76:27.97]Oh shit, here comes a Frink.
[76:31.69]Jesus, Aaron, it sounds like thousands of them.
[76:33.68]But where the hell are they?
[76:34.88]Out there.
[76:36.06]They're on Jerma985 stream.
[76:36.84]I can't see us.
[76:39.16]There are thousands of them.
[76:40.72]What?
[76:42.70]Must be using these air ducts to get around the ship.
[76:47.36]They could be everywhere by now.
[76:49.76]I really hope this is a fight.
[76:51.08]Please give us a fight.
[76:53.68]No.
[76:53.74]Good.
[76:54.00]Alright, we're fine.
[76:56.14]Don't forget they're hurtling, they're going towards the sun.
[77:00.06]Ah, that's true, yeah.
[77:24.59]Not enough for a budget fight.
[77:25.77]This is the engine room.
[77:50.25]That's what I thought she said too, but I figured I was gonna get minus to it if I said that What are we looking for
[78:30.76]-2 for thinking.
[78:31.82]Come on.
[78:33.36]This is an early movie game?
[78:43.55]Yeah?
[78:45.23]This is what all your favorite movie games are sort of based on.
[78:50.93]Actor in the golden age of the 3DO.
[78:56.48]An early PC game.
[79:01.57]They made these all the time because graphics weren't that good.
[79:04.24]So real life looked great.
[79:09.58]That's why there was a shitload of FMV games.
[79:11.26]What is that?
[79:18.49]Is that a pool noodle?
[79:21.41]Where did she get this?
[79:23.55]What?
[79:28.19]What did happen to him?
[79:29.47]It didn't even touch him.
[79:32.11]And why is she about to, like, crack his back?
[79:37.19]Did he pass out from fear?
[79:44.11]Oh, he cringed so hard at that last joke that he couldn't go on.
[79:48.11]He passed out.
[79:48.79]One of those little flying things made an R2-D2 noise and he cringed to fucking death.
[80:03.28]Strap?
[80:04.06]Why can't I help?
[80:10.96]Don't forget about me.
[80:16.41]Oh, that's... Yes, it is.
[80:32.27]Oh, I'm getting too old for this shit.
[80:35.23]You're like 25 in this video.
[80:38.68]Hey, Casey.
[80:39.08]I believe you're like less than 30 in this game.
[80:40.88]Remember right after Basic?
[80:43.36]We were dying to get into a real war.
[80:47.22]We weren't even ready.
[80:48.12]I guess nobody is.
[80:53.70]Combat changes, people.
[80:55.06]It was 38.
[80:57.75]Really?
[80:58.31]Zach got crazier.
[81:01.54]I just got tougher.
[81:03.42]And I did it to keep him alive.
[81:08.92]But not you, Case.
[81:10.30]Why are we not talking?
[81:11.04]You never changed.
[81:15.99]Is this like the monolog where she describes to be the villain of the story?
[81:21.19]You're always there for us.
[81:23.93]Straight and steady.
[81:28.96]But now you've changed too.
[81:34.06]I'm gonna have to put you down.
[81:34.94]Yes!
[81:35.06]I do!
[81:35.34]Why did he pull me from the lab?
[81:39.19]I don't know who I'm supposed to be.
[82:04.12]You know, when we get out of this thing, I'm going to find you somebody that can... Somebody that can build you a voice.
[82:11.37]That's a promise.
[82:14.29]You're okay.
[82:14.77]Was I... Wait, was I a robot the whole time?
[82:19.74]I wasn't another passenger on the ship.
[82:26.24]Oh, yeah.
[82:26.74]I was another crew member, right?
[82:34.86]Long elevators.
[82:35.46]What's that a reference to?
[82:36.52]I don't get it.
[82:37.16]What does that mean?
[82:40.79]Fourth floor.
[82:41.55]Ladies lingerie.
[82:42.57]Yeah.
[83:02.78]A mall joke.
[83:03.84]What the hell is it?
[83:04.74]Oh.
[83:06.88]Well, your guess is as good as mine.
[83:10.24]Looks important, though.
[83:11.23]I wonder how you activate it.
[83:16.67]Zach?
[83:18.45]Hey, Brooke's in my conference.
[83:19.89]Hey.
[83:20.87]Hey.
[83:21.83]Casey, why don't you see if you can figure this thing out?
[83:23.63]Let me check over there.
[83:30.15]See if I can figure it out.
[83:31.11]Alright, oh no, I can't wait to- I can't wait to get very angry in about 45 seconds.
[83:37.88]Let's analyze it.
[83:38.84]It's gonna be another ship.
[83:41.06]It's gonna be another robot communication thing.
[83:43.40]And we're gonna communicate with each other.
[83:45.84]Right?
[83:46.82]Now that would be a pretty cool twist.
[83:49.06]If I end up talking to the robot in here.
[83:51.60]And I get, like, the story.
[83:53.14]And it's- they're not bad.
[83:54.10]The robot's just doing, you know, what the ro- this robot's doing.
[83:56.88]And I'm owned by these people, whatever.
[84:02.48]That'd be kind of cool, right?
[84:08.71]I just pressed... I don't know what I just did.
[84:13.01]I got it.
[84:13.33]I opened it.
[84:14.61]Wow, look at that.
[84:18.31]It's beautiful.
[84:20.53]Yeah.
[84:23.28]Graveyards usually are.
[84:25.74]So we think maybe some kind of sundial.
[84:28.82]Hmm.
[84:29.96]Not sure.
[84:32.30]Why did she just nod, like, doze off?
[84:37.22]That was weird.
[84:39.02]Oh, shit.
[84:39.46]Okay.
[85:00.80]analyze this um okay press this okay red red red red activate I have to match the colors that they're in
[85:22.47]Do they all have to be the same color?
[85:23.69]Blue.
[85:24.27]Everything has to be blue.
[85:25.05]No, everything has to be blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
[85:27.33]Turn it blue.
[85:28.37]Everything has to be red.
[85:29.55]Red, red, red, red.
[85:31.26]Everything has to be orange.
[85:32.06]Orange.
[85:33.98]Red.
[85:36.46]Everything- Wait.
[85:40.50]I have to just put the colors in the right spots?
[85:50.97]But there's no green.
[85:55.02]What color am I supposed to make this?
[86:00.64]I don't get it either.
[86:09.81]Red.
[86:10.09]Purple.
[86:10.49]Make it purple.
[86:13.21]It's blue.
[86:19.20]Blue.
[86:22.06]Oh, it's all purple.
[86:22.74]I got it.
[86:24.20]Everything's purple.
[86:25.36]Did I win?
[86:49.58]I don't know what it wants me to do.
[86:58.72]So this is, the outside has colors, and then the inside has colors.
[87:04.25]I, okay, I get it.
[87:06.83]We need to combine, whatever is in, so this, you know, for instance, yellow and green makes blue.
[87:14.05]No, yellow and blue makes green.
[87:17.00]Right?
[87:17.80]So this is green going into here.
[87:22.62]What does red and yellow makes orange?
[87:27.54]Okay.
[87:29.06]So we have blue.
[87:30.90]I don't understand.
[87:31.90]I have no idea what this wants me to do.
[87:33.99]You're overthinking this like crazy.
[87:35.65]I don't know.
[87:35.97]I don't get it.
[87:36.41]What does it want me to do?
[87:43.11]Okay.
[87:50.13]Just match the colors to the outside.
[87:52.17]I can't do that.
[87:52.75]There's no green.
[87:53.49]There's no green!
[87:54.42]There's no green and there's no blue.
[88:01.16]Then match the other ones.
[88:15.13]Alright, so I need to... They already are done.
[88:18.17]There's no orange.
[88:20.13]This is... I already did it.
[88:21.16]I matched it.
[88:22.10]What about the manual?
[88:28.56]Clicking on the outer ring of the hemisphere... Oh, never mind.
[88:35.99]I thought I had it.
[88:37.61]Clicking on the outer ring of the...
[88:45.35]Clicking on the outer ring of the hemispheres causes two of them to change colors.
[88:49.14]The goal is to change all of the hemispheres to yellow.
[88:52.28]Okay, great.
[88:53.42]I would never have known that I had to make them all yellow.
[88:55.36]I made them all purple.
[89:15.39]Like, how was I supposed to know that all of them had to be yellow?
[89:22.08]I made them all purple.
[89:22.82]Do we have to drive this thing?
[89:35.42]Yeah.
[89:35.76]Yeah.
[89:48.24]Wait, wait, wait.
[89:48.70]You hear that?
[89:51.44]It's in there.
[89:53.40]It's coming from the bodies.
[89:55.87]It's the cringe.
[89:59.65]Yup.
[90:02.11]Oh, shit.
[90:02.89]You killed me.
[90:08.94]Oh, fuck.
[90:10.42]Oh, fuck.
[90:21.60]You killed him!
[90:28.28]Oh, no.
[90:30.63]I didn't think... That's the first time they've given me an opportunity to shoot anything.
[90:33.73]Alright, I need to shoot her.
[90:36.95]Shoot her next.
[90:41.11]Listen, I think we've done enough looking around here, don't you?
[90:44.56]Yeah.
[90:46.39]Look, do you really expect a robot that takes 40 minutes to complete a children's match puzzle to be able to aim a weapon correctly?
[90:58.91]You killed him.
[91:00.51]That was more funny to me than anything else.
[91:03.49]Look right in the camera, right in my eyes.
[91:05.59]You killed him.
[91:16.28]He shoot, he tried, he killed me!
[91:18.16]His last ditch effort was, I'm gonna kill this motherfucker.
[91:22.34]He got it.
[91:22.92]He got his final thing, his final wish.
[91:26.92]What a way to end that.
[91:28.42]I kill her, he gets stabbed through the throat and then kills me.
[91:31.63]Is this a Tarantino movie?
[91:42.77]Listen, I think we've done enough looking around here, don't you?
[91:47.34]You killed him.
[91:48.26]So I have to shoot the aliens that come out.
[92:01.09]Here we go.
[92:18.55]So lame.
[92:19.63]This is what you look like when you play VR.
[92:24.91]They're everywhere!
[92:25.55]I got one.
[92:35.48]What was he doing?
[92:36.34]Oh wait, what is he doing?
[92:38.60]He shoots behind his head like three times.
[92:44.54]He's aiming at the ground.
[92:51.30]He's shooting at the ground.
[93:06.29]He's just shooting the ceiling.
[93:09.84]What?
[93:11.74]What?
[93:21.82]You know what?
[93:22.20]You can't blame them for that either, though.
[93:24.35]Like, these actors, they're in front of a green screen, they have no idea.
[93:28.35]There's somebody right there going, and... Action!
[93:31.81]Shoot all around you!
[93:32.69]Shoot, shoot, shoot!
[93:33.67]Look out behind you, behind you, behind you!
[93:34.89]Get that one, get that one!
[93:35.63]Duck, duck, duck, duck!
[93:36.75]They're everywhere!
[93:37.57]They're everywhere!
[93:38.27]They're on the ground!
[93:38.91]They're everywhere!
[93:39.87]There's one crawling on you!
[93:41.47]And then the effects artist has to take all this thing that the director told them to do and be like, what am I supposed to do with this shit?
[93:49.23]They're supposed to be flying around the ship.
[93:50.47]They're not supposed to be on the ground.
[93:57.33]You can't blame the actors for this.
[93:59.15]They're doing their best.
[94:00.67]For all things considered.
[94:01.56]They are.
[94:11.78]Listen, I think we've done enough looking around here, don't you?
[94:15.18]They're doing their best for porn actors.
[94:16.82]Uh, Tia... What's her name?
[94:21.40]Tia... What's her name?
[94:24.06]She was famous actress!
[94:26.01]Tia Correra.
[94:28.81]Tia Correra.
[94:30.73]She was in Wayne's World.
[94:32.07]No, yeah, she was a very... She was like an A-lister at one point.
[94:34.91]Aw, shit!
[94:39.97]Aw, shit!
[94:41.41]Aw, shit!
[94:41.71]Aw, shit!
[94:46.96]What does this game have for a rating?
[94:52.38]Oh shit!
[94:53.24]Did he say shit in the T game?
[95:00.81]Did he just grab one off of her shoulder?
[95:18.34]Alright, how many... How many more do we have to do?
[95:21.92]How long is this?
[95:28.11]I want one of them to stub their toe on something.
[95:30.29]Because look, as somebody that's been in front of a green screen, doing this exact thing.
[95:34.19]This exact thing.
[95:35.95]It's fucking tiring and it's painful.
[95:42.60]In fact, I hope somebody puts me in this scene.
[95:49.89]Now they act but there are this erupt What do I do what do I do I have to save one of them Extend the hand turn the thrusters off analyze data Wait did I just hit my head?
[96:26.22]In a panic, I ran around and Scooby-Doo Shaggy somehow saved the day.
[96:40.26]What do you want me to do?
[96:41.20]Analyze the damage.
[96:46.10]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[96:47.66]What is this?
[96:53.27]Okay, this connects?
[96:55.57]Connect them?
[96:58.20]Connect all of them.
[97:06.53]What?
[97:08.81]Shit.
[97:09.17]Okay, they have- They're color-coded.
[97:12.09]This is yellow.
[97:12.75]When I press the- Okay.
[97:14.39]So that- Yellow is gonna make all the ones that are yellow move.
[97:18.04]Red is gonna make all the ones that are red move.
[97:21.56]Blue is gonna make all the ones that are blue move.
[97:24.40]I just did it.
[97:26.94]Damn it.
[97:27.32]I didn't.
[97:27.82]Hold on.
[97:34.37]I did it, that's it.
[97:36.51]No, what?
[97:37.09]That's not what that is?
[97:45.57]What?
[97:50.64]Some have two colors.
[97:51.66]Yeah, yeah, but okay, when I press this yellow one, ready, watch.
[97:54.58]You would assume that all the ones that have a yellow square are the ones that open or close, right?
[97:57.88]Okay.
[98:00.50]Okay.
[98:02.46]So then, with this theory, it's done.
[98:06.66]These are the only two yellows.
[98:09.76]Right?
[98:10.92]Except for this one here.
[98:14.30]Okay, now we need to do this one, and then we have to have one that's, we have to do a red.
[98:18.50]Now it's, it's done.
[98:19.72]I did it.
[98:21.06]Wait, no I didn't.
[98:21.84]Hold on, wait!
[98:25.54]Hold on.
[98:26.46]Shit!
[98:36.29]What will open?
[98:36.91]Okay, this will open.
[98:37.91]I need to, okay, um, open the yellows.
[98:42.98]And then close all the blues and yellows.
[98:47.98]Shit.
[98:56.08]Red or blue.
[99:09.33]God damn it.
[99:09.85]I think that's it.
[99:12.82]Did I do it?
[99:16.20]Got it.
[99:16.58]No.
[99:17.76]Stupid blue.
[99:20.23]Stupid blue one.
[99:21.35]I had to press this one.
[99:36.66]now that's it right hold on I need to do some red red will this will close all the reds and the yellows this is open why why does this one have to be open
[100:15.56]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[100:17.80]Blue and yellow.
[100:19.92]You stupid motherfucker.
[100:26.60]It doesn't help that it's wicked ugly, too.
[100:36.17]It's this, the ones, the doubles.
[100:37.97]The doubles would just fuck everything up.
[100:46.80]Blue and red.
[100:48.36]Blue and red.
[100:49.28]That's it.
[100:51.28]No, it's not.
[100:55.75]God damn it.
[101:01.13]Press the one red one and then the yellow blue one.
[101:16.94]This is the kind of iPad game that I download sometimes.
[101:20.27]I play the first three levels and I go, nope, and I hold my thumb on the icon and I delete the app.
[101:34.45]So why even have the greens here?
[101:35.94]They don't do anything.
[101:37.22]It's all this yellow, blue, red shit.
[101:40.02]Now, if I do this one, it'll close all the yellow ones.
[101:43.76]I don't want to do that.
[101:44.58]I want to do... Um... Um... A... Uh... And... And then, um...
[102:10.27]I don't even care.
[102:11.07]I don't do puzzles.
[102:13.96]I've run wicked fast.
[102:15.78]You know what I mean?
[102:16.40]Like, that's not what I do.
[102:17.46]I don't care.
[102:19.26]Hit the blue one now.
[102:23.74]Oh, I did it.
[102:36.17]Alright, Case.
[102:36.95]We thought we lost you there for a minute.
[102:38.93]You gave up at the finish line.
[102:40.11]What?
[102:40.35]I've repaired myself for them to make me open a new door with another puzzle.
[102:43.11]Is that all I'm worth to you guys?
[103:14.08]I just saved both of your lives twice.
[103:15.76]Remember when you got sucked out of the window and I had to come to your rescue?
[103:19.38]Remember when you were being swarmed by aliens and I shot all of them?
[103:25.22]Not one of you.
[103:27.56]Got one kill.
[103:33.51]Okay.
[103:34.19]Let's open it up.
[103:45.57]Okay.
[103:46.57]Please insert disk 3.
[103:47.78]This one is gonna be hell, I can already tell.
[103:53.14]We're already at disk 3.
[103:54.89]We're gonna beat this game, I think.
[103:56.13]I think we're actually gonna beat this game.
[104:06.06]And for all the naysayers in here, if I have a sort of a gauge of how I gauge if I'm going to complete a video game or not, if you get to disk three out of four, just do the whole thing.
[104:20.92]There's probably like another 40 minutes in this damn game.
[104:31.41]That's not sunk cost.
[104:32.47]I want to see the end.
[104:41.53]Virgin Interactive.
[104:43.27]What about it?
[104:43.67]Alright, what am I trying to make here?
[104:57.28]Am I supposed to fill the whole thing in a certain color?
[104:59.24]What does the manual say?
[105:07.37]Manual says...
[105:14.32]Oh, this would be the blue door, right?
[105:16.76]Okay.
[105:17.26]When you rotate the outer hexagons by clicking on them, the corresponding shape is also rotated in the center hexagon.
[105:23.12]If any of the colored shapes intersect in the center hexagon, the overlapping triangles turn gray.
[105:28.64]The goal is to rotate the shapes so that there are no gray triangles in the center.
[105:35.47]Easy.
[105:55.61]This is not going to be easy.
[105:58.29]Alright, that one fits up there.
[105:59.69]Wait.
[106:00.73]That one fits in there.
[106:04.17]That's right there.
[106:04.79]Alright, we got something wrong here.
[106:08.49]Something wrong here.
[106:09.45]It's this guy.
[106:14.59]Get it!
[106:15.45]What?
[106:16.19]There's more.
[106:17.59]Oh, dear.
[106:18.39]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[106:19.55]This is going to be the three of these.
[106:27.63]No, I don't want to do this.
[106:28.49]Okay, the third one.
[106:36.49]Where can I fit you?
[106:43.23]Wait, wait.
[106:43.73]Okay, that's good.
[106:48.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[106:51.50]Is it the green?
[106:55.51]Get rid of this orange.
[106:58.47]Orange has got to go this way.
[107:00.83]No.
[107:03.19]No.
[107:09.01]No.
[107:09.86]No, it's wrong.
[107:16.70]Yellow absolutely goes right here.
[107:18.30]Red is absolutely right there.
[107:19.62]Pink.
[107:21.02]Oh, pink is absolutely not over there.
[107:24.75]Or is it?
[107:25.25]It might be.
[107:27.97]Oh yeah, pink is absolutely over there.
[107:29.69]Okay, what about over here?
[107:30.81]White?
[107:31.25]Absolutely.
[107:41.02]What goes here though?
[107:49.97]Nothing fits in that spot right there.
[107:51.85]Does anything go there?
[107:54.93]That does.
[107:56.35]What else can go there?
[108:01.43]OK, wait, that is I think that's the only solution there.
[108:07.13]Hello, you moron.
[108:10.45]Hey, the next time you're doing like a Sudoku, I'm going to stand over your shoulder.
[108:13.56]And when you when you do one wrong and you like erase it with your pencil, I'm going to go, you idiot, you're stupid.
[108:20.40]And you're going to go fucking lumped around in my puzzle, man, leave me alone.
[108:24.70]Then I'm going to drink the rest of the coffee that's in the pot.
[108:27.81]And fucking walk, like, upstairs.
[108:29.75]And then you're going to go for a coffee, like, a round two.
[108:31.65]Second coffee.
[108:32.21]You're going to be fucking furious.
[108:33.41]That's enough.
[108:34.25]I did it.
[108:34.65]I drank it.
[108:35.13]Alright, hold on.
[109:17.76]Fuck.
[109:18.58]What is this?
[109:19.06]No, this is red.
[109:19.76]That's okay.
[109:21.74]Should red be down here?
[109:22.68]No, red's right.
[109:28.34]Blue is not right.
[109:31.22]Yellow's not right either.
[109:34.69]None.
[109:36.87]Fuck.
[109:37.51]I don't know.
[109:41.33]Orange and green.
[109:42.17]Orange and green.
[109:42.99]Orange and green.
[109:43.87]Orange and green.
[109:46.67]That makes sense.
[109:49.93]That makes sense, but what's taking up this spot over here?
[109:53.29]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[109:57.43]That's... I didn't fill one in.
[110:01.95]What's that little space right there I didn't fill in?
[110:03.65]I was trying to fill that in.
[110:08.28]Alright, Casey.
[110:12.90]I guess you need to leave one spot?
[110:15.22]This is amazing.
[110:17.04]Look at the size of it.
[110:19.23]Harry, I can't even see the bottom here.
[110:24.66]More monkey noises now.
[110:25.88]Alright, fine.
[110:26.52]I wonder what this is for.
[110:29.04]I guess we're gonna find out.
[110:46.95]Did she just try to grab his gun?
[110:51.99]You both almost died twice.
[110:53.41]This is not a place to fuck around.
[110:56.61]Like, is everyone, like, spitting on me?
[110:59.03]What, am I not allowed to hang out on the platform with them?
[111:15.13]Did you feel that?
[111:15.83]The bones?
[111:19.53]Was it good for you?
[111:38.23]I'm leaving.
[111:39.71]I spent the last 50 chat messages trying to help this stream, and all he does is call us morons while he struggles to finish this simpleton puzzle.
[111:46.79]You know, the streamer is the moron being mean to us.
[111:48.83]I'm not subbing.
[111:51.29]We'll be back tomorrow.
[111:54.59]It's gotta be a projection.
[111:57.31]Or an illusion.
[111:58.06]Hey, hey, wait.
[111:59.66]Maybe that... Yeah, see you tomorrow.
[112:01.56]...energy field we went through before somehow, you know, transported us to the home world.
[112:07.25]Why can we breathe out here?
[112:10.44]What happened to the spacesuit?
[112:11.72]This is an illusion.
[112:12.40]It's pretty damn convincing.
[112:29.36]It's actually kind of funny if they found a little door over here and they opened it and it was like a big set.
[112:33.77]Cameras and stuff and they were like, oh shit.
[112:36.27]Closed it.
[112:36.73]Yeah, I guess we are alright here.
[112:45.93]It wasn't real.
[112:46.83]It was a mirage.
[112:48.83]It was fake.
[112:52.61]Don't put your face that close.
[112:57.37]Yeah, you had to make like the jokes and make the condescending remarks and now he's dead.
[113:30.92]What?
[113:32.08]I let go of them?
[113:33.34]When did I let go of them?
[113:38.03]I didn't press anything.
[113:44.03]I didn't, I didn't, Jesus Christ, I didn't press anything.
[113:50.77]He grabs me and says, oh, thank God, I love you.
[113:54.59]And then I, what do I do?
[113:55.67]He didn't give me a prompt or anything.
[114:01.26]Thrusters.
[114:01.76]Alright, thruster.
[114:11.57]Press yes?
[114:18.19]No.
[114:19.67]What is thruster?
[114:20.25]This is thruster, right?
[114:21.17]This guy.
[114:23.63]This is thruster right here, right?
[114:29.14]This is thruster.
[114:32.25]Let's go!
[114:32.81]Oh look, this has like the lines on it.
[114:38.88]That's the thrust line.
[114:40.98]What?
[114:41.20]Should I do something and... Do I have to dodge anything?
[114:52.38]Uh... I think we're just going.
[115:15.45]Wouldn't he have fallen?
[115:16.31]Oh, okay.
[115:17.53]No, yeah, he would have.
[115:18.19]He would have just fallen right through.
[115:19.73]Isn't the ground here transparent?
[115:23.10]A child?
[115:23.36]A child.
[115:23.70]Okay.
[115:47.24]For the life of me.
[115:49.24]I can't figure out why, um, why you, uh, keep doing it.
[115:55.61]Unless, of course, you care about me more than you'd like to admit.
[116:00.37]Is this the, the, you rented like the 45 minute hour, like that, it's not even an hour and 30 minutes.
[116:07.50]It's like 48 minute long porn movie.
[116:11.20]And they just do this, the entire movie, until the last 12 minutes.
[116:22.03]And all of you, just fast forward to the last 12 minutes.
[116:31.51]You're speaking from experience.
[116:47.64]No, I've never seen a pornographic film in my entire life.
[116:52.05]That's disgusting to me, what you just said.
[116:54.95]How dare you ever even assume that I've seen one of these disgusting, revolting, pornographic films.
[117:02.93]No, I drink water, and I do my chores.
[117:08.18]Are there anything else?
[117:09.62]I'm glad that we're partners, is what I mean.
[117:12.88]I'm glad that I know you.
[117:15.70]We still have to take a look around here.
[117:17.14]I think you can manage that.
[117:19.10]Yeah, yeah, I can manage that.
[117:21.41]Uh, but remember, this time... I know, I know, I know.
[117:23.65]Be careful.
[117:24.85]It doesn't do taxes.
[117:25.93]You just admitted it.
[117:28.33]What?
[117:28.79]How do you... Where do you get that from?
[117:29.99]Thanks, Casey.
[117:40.03]Chores is watch porn.
[117:47.23]Sometimes it feels like that, don't it?
[117:55.71]What is this?
[118:09.40]Look!
[118:10.62]Alright, what's today?
[118:11.62]Today's Thursday.

[118:19.84]I got the mail.
[118:20.60]I washed the windows.
[118:21.51]I guess it's time to do this?
[118:25.57]I'm not tired yet.
[118:26.31]What time is it?
[118:26.69]Oh, it's like, it's like 830.
[118:27.43]I'm not gonna fall asleep for like another six hours or so, probably.
[118:30.46]Ah, thank you.
[118:30.78]I mean, I mean, I guess.
[119:00.30]stop talking okay let's keep going left casey I can't wait I can joke and make fuck around about like everything else but not about like be careful don't talk about this it's the one thing that's off limits besides politics and that's even bullshit because you've heard me do like every politician's voice you've heard on the stream
[119:30.40]Alright, this is a crystal puzzle.
[119:31.58]I know this one.
[119:34.70]Your son is watching.
[119:38.86]No, you had to click the yes, I mature audience filter.
[119:42.38]It's on.
[119:43.86]You had to press that button.
[119:51.04]I think I'm doing this right somehow, accidentally.
[119:58.19]Does it do it?
[120:08.15]To solve this puzzle, you must freeze the objects in pairs of matching silhouettes, causing them to become highlighted.
[120:27.17]When all the objects are highlighted, the lock will open.
[120:32.49]In pairs of matching silhouettes.
[120:37.57]Well, like, triangle, triangle.
[120:42.78]Diamond, diamond.
[120:57.22]Uh.
[121:02.44]Please need to stop watching.
[121:03.42]It's been an issue for quite a while.
[121:04.44]We're aware of it, but you keep watching this sort of material on stream.
[121:06.80]I'm going to have no choice but to unsubscribe.
[121:09.22]Why am I watching this on stream?
[121:11.20]Alright, is it Pac-Man?
[121:21.93]No, it's not Pac-Man.
[121:22.73]What is it then?
[121:23.17]Circle?
[121:23.97]Circle?
[121:33.65]You need to match the silhouette.
[121:35.61]It's the shape.
[121:36.99]Yeah, okay, hold on.
[121:37.77]Can I get a little tab in the middle there?
[121:39.75]Is that even... I don't think this even does that.
[121:46.93]Moon?
[121:47.19]Little half moon?
[121:51.40]Not really.
[121:54.66]Oh, it's not just shape, not color.
[121:57.00]Ahhhhhhhhhh.
[122:04.92]I gotta find the star.
[122:13.19]Is there a star?
[122:17.57]Oh, not a star.
[122:18.13]Maybe something else.
[122:18.67]Maybe a cube.
[122:23.54]I got this one right here.
[122:24.50]Check it out.
[122:34.21]Oh, what about this cube?
[122:36.55]Oh, that's a star.
[122:38.65]It could also be a cube.
[122:40.29]It could also be a star.
[122:47.82]No, I can't.
[122:49.84]No!
[122:59.28]Wait, that's the only one that's been matched so far.
[123:01.80]Oh, shit.
[123:07.89]No!
[123:10.73]No, dude.
[123:11.49]I can't get it right.
[123:21.73]How is that not the same?
[123:22.75]It has to be the exact same thing.
[123:27.60]Oh, God.
[123:33.68]Same deal with this one, okay.
[123:36.82]Whack.
[123:37.84]And then... Whack.
[123:42.77]Did I win?
[123:43.25]Oh, you only have to do it for three of them.
[123:49.23]Oh, dude.
[123:54.18]Was that an alien talking?
[123:59.72]Or did they have to record somebody that was in the sound room and not the actor?
[124:04.05]Because they needed something there.
[124:07.86]Yeah, that's what it was.
[124:09.38]One of the audio engineers had to do that.
[124:12.70]I'm like, trust me, the clown.
[124:15.20]It did.
[124:15.42]Is that about eating these aliens?
[124:16.51]Have some respect.
[124:16.95]Why?
[124:17.07]Because they're dead.
[124:17.51]This guy is a genuine asshole.
[124:18.91]Barbershop?
[124:40.85]Nightclub?
[124:43.74]Come on, Aerie, this looks like a band.
[124:46.46]Should I ask them to play our song?
[124:48.86]We don't have a song, Zack.
[124:53.99]If there was a nav console and all this stuff, we'd have to tear this place apart to find it.
[124:58.53]Assuming we'll even know it when we see it.
[125:00.31]I think we should take a look around.
[125:02.89]I think you should die, Dallas.
[125:06.72]Let us know if you spot anything, Casey.
[125:08.65]I will.
[125:08.97]Thanks for including me, by the way.
[125:11.51]I know you don't have to.
[125:13.90]Well, unless you're having better luck than I am, I think we should keep going.
[125:19.06]Didn't even... No, I got nothing.
[125:21.62]I didn't get one second.
[125:28.55]That's all the time you're going to give me here.
[125:31.17]I'll say one thing about those Krenn.
[125:33.65]Make sure as hell do a thorough job.
[125:35.79]That room must have been like a 10 by 10 cube.
[125:40.55]I sure hope so.
[125:42.41]You know, it's times like this I wish I just stayed home and went to business school just like mama wanted.
[125:48.09]This looks the same in 160 that does in 1080.
[125:49.87]I can just picture you crunching numbers for a living.
[125:52.25]I'm sure it does.
[125:53.01]Well, it just so happens I have a pretty good head for figures.
[125:56.28]I can't add information for the bitrate to take.
[126:00.02]Okay, Casey, time to try another one.
[126:05.93]Puzzle door.
[126:09.45]All I can do is upscale this.
[126:11.69]I can't add data to what's being presented.
[126:20.39]Orange.
[126:20.81]Red.
[126:21.88]Green.
[126:22.80]Blue.
[126:25.66]Does this even count as a video game?
[126:28.94]Well, I mean, it depends.
[126:31.40]Does the back of your cereal box...
[126:35.10]consider itself to be a video game.
[126:36.86]I mean, it's a game.
[126:46.76]But, I mean, this is on video.
[126:50.40]So, yes, it is, technically.
[126:51.46]Let's take a look at what this one is.
[126:53.10]Okay.
[126:58.88]The objective is to route a colored light so that it reaches the flashing point of the same color.
[127:03.78]Okay.
[127:06.53]You can deflect the path of light by clicking in the cells.
[127:10.53]It is alright for the colors to mix at the position where they hit the flashing points.
[127:16.50]Blue to blue.
[127:18.28]That's not cheating.
[127:18.98]How else would I even know what to do?
[127:20.48]Wait, what's this goo I'm putting on it?
[127:31.97]Oh, no, there's mirrors.
[127:34.27]Oh, dear.
[127:34.91]These are mirrors.
[127:40.19]Oh, fucking Jesus.
[127:41.65]This is going to be horrible.
[127:46.90]Take this off.
[127:48.68]It's got to be here.
[127:52.54]Get all these mirrors off.
[127:56.38]Take all these mirrors off.
[127:57.24]Alright, we're going to go this way.
[128:01.15]Take that mirror off.
[128:02.33]Get this one off.
[128:04.19]This way.
[128:04.63]We're going to bounce it from here to here.
[128:09.14]Get that mirror off.
[128:14.30]Okay.
[128:15.14]That one's done.
[128:16.48]Now we need green.
[128:19.77]Green.
[128:20.37]Where's green?
[128:23.89]Where's the... Oh, okay.
[128:25.01]Green.
[128:26.67]So green is gonna go... Down here.
[128:29.05]We need to type a touch down here.
[128:37.97]No.
[128:38.15]How do I erase?
[128:40.65]Erase.
[128:40.95]Erase.
[128:41.21]Erase.
[128:41.49]Erase.
[128:41.81]Erase.
[128:42.23]Erase.
[128:42.69]Erase.
[128:43.01]Okay.
[128:48.79]Down.
[128:49.11]And then right here, we're going to bend it this way.
[128:51.45]I don't know.
[128:53.87]I don't know.
[128:55.73]Oh, Jesus.
[128:56.33]Okay.
[129:05.06]Got it.
[129:05.36]Wait.
[129:08.04]Odd watchers do your taxes.
[129:13.17]I mean, you could if you wanted to.
[129:17.90]This goes this way.
[129:18.92]We need to bounce it to here.
[129:20.14]There it is.
[129:34.13]Okay, so that's that.
[129:35.13]Now we just need red.
[129:45.03]Shit.
[129:47.11]Yeah!
[129:48.19]We have to do it again.
[129:51.21]Red to red.
[129:52.33]Blue to blue.
[129:55.54]Blue is already there.
[129:56.94]Come on.
[130:04.38]So I have to hit... Wait, what the hell is going on?
[130:12.74]Green is already there?
[130:16.48]Red and then... Red and then... Red and then red?
[130:21.95]Okay, red and then, uh... Oh, shit.
[130:31.37]This is gonna get ugly.
[130:32.11]This is gonna get really gonna get ugly.
[130:40.69]This is gonna get ugly.
[130:48.85]Okay, blue is already blue.
[130:59.22]Shit.
[131:01.18]Shit.
[131:07.12]I'm blue watching this.
[131:11.36]Flashlight in the top right.
[131:13.95]Oh, that's not what you said.
[131:16.09]You said something else.
[131:24.48]Alright, blue to blue.
[131:26.08]Now we need green to green.
[131:28.09]Green to green.
[131:29.37]That's it.
[131:29.75]This is red right here.
[131:38.01]Shit.
[131:38.61]So close.
[131:44.76]That's it.
[131:46.76]How's that not it?
[131:48.22]Blue needs to go up here.
[132:14.81]This is very bad.
[132:16.29]Fuck.
[132:47.32]Delete everything.
[132:47.90]Delete, delete, delete, delete.
[132:48.88]Delete it all.
[132:49.32]Delete it all.
[132:49.74]Delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.
[132:50.78]Get it all.
[132:51.30]There's so many fucking mirrors.
[132:52.52]There's mirrors everywhere.
[132:54.24]Wait.
[132:55.16]Keep it.
[132:59.30]Okay, I did it.
[132:59.92]Alright.
[133:00.44]There's another one.
[133:02.67]Cool.
[133:03.77]Not cool.
[133:08.13]Blue is blue.
[133:09.35]Blue's gotta go over here.
[133:22.45]Then... No, I don't want to do this one.
[133:27.78]I don't want to do this one.
[133:29.46]I really don't want to do this one.
[133:32.24]I have to.
[133:45.22]You said you would finish the game.
[133:46.81]Who said I was gonna stop playing the game?
[133:50.28]I was just going to go to the walkthrough and... Wait, the walkthrough is on easy.
[133:53.20]Didalis encounter walkthrough medium.
[134:00.50]Alright, I'm almost there.
[134:09.41]Almost at the end of the game.
[134:11.27]Alright, here we go.
[134:19.96]This is the one I'm on right now.
[134:20.80]I'm just going to follow it word for word.
[134:28.42]Wait.
[134:32.43]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[134:33.53]I'm just going to follow it word for word.
[134:34.49]Wait, this is not right.
[134:35.45]Blue, green, red.
[134:37.57]This one's not right.
[134:42.97]Why is this different than mine?
[134:47.48]Blue on the left.
[134:49.41]Blue on the top.
[134:50.07]This is different than mine.
[134:52.72]God fucking damn it.
[134:55.78]I can't change the difficulty.
[134:58.56]Can I?
[135:06.18]It's randomized.
[135:07.30]Fuck.
[135:11.20]Why do you have to have to be randomized?
[135:12.95]Alright, that means I have to just do it.
[135:14.45]That means I have to do it.
[135:16.31]Here we go.
[135:17.61]Step by step.
[135:19.23]That's one.
[135:23.45]One is done.
[135:24.23]Green.
[135:26.07]Green is going to go from here to here.
[135:29.07]And then from here to here.
[135:31.17]Nope.
[135:31.67]One more down.
[135:33.36]One more down.
[135:35.26]Green is done.
[135:36.44]No, it's not.
[135:37.42]Now it will be.
[135:37.98]Fuck.
[135:41.72]This is not good.
[135:43.74]Wait.
[135:44.00]Hold on.
[135:51.98]69 69 viewers watching Okay, that's kind of cool.
[135:58.84]I guess They have to I gotta go down here for this one, too.
[136:02.90]Why did I make this medium?
[136:04.60]Why didn't I just put it on easy who cares?
[136:06.62]It's my own damn fault
[136:19.40]Oh, Jesus.
[136:20.26]I'm just gonna try.
[136:21.36]It's gonna be really sloppy, but it might work.
[136:26.84]Green.
[136:30.36]Blue needs to go... Wait, why is this... This is red now.
[136:34.18]What the fuck happened?
[136:36.34]That one's done.
[136:37.68]There's another red right here.
[136:39.72]Get rid of everything.
[136:40.26]We're doing red first.
[136:49.20]Okay.
[136:51.26]Green.
[136:54.56]There's only one green on the right.
[136:57.80]So we go bounce, bounce, bounce.
[137:03.29]Done.
[137:03.65]Okay.
[137:04.75]Red is done.
[137:06.07]There is no more red.
[137:07.97]Except for down here.
[137:09.65]Okay.
[137:10.03]Red is done.
[137:11.63]It's now time to move on to green.
[137:13.01]Green.
[137:28.17]Green.
[137:29.23]Where's the other green?
[137:30.79]Over here.
[137:33.94]Oh, shit.
[137:35.40]What?
[137:35.80]How am I supposed to get that?
[137:43.96]How am I supposed to get that one?
[137:53.31]Colors can mix at the ends.
[137:56.33]Ugh.
[138:03.12]This has to be blue somehow.
[138:10.45]Need to go back to the fourth grade.
[138:11.67]No, this is fucking like difficult and annoying.
[138:15.71]Alright, I'm not gonna sit here and take that.
[138:18.61]This is like an annoying shit puzzle.
[138:37.67]Blue?
[138:38.93]Blue?
[138:39.42]Oh, hold on.
[138:39.98]Almost there.
[138:40.58]I got it.
[138:42.28]I'm gonna get it right now.
[138:43.20]Ready?
[138:46.02]Oh, hold on.
[138:52.24]Yes!
[138:54.04]Does that count?
[139:01.44]Does it count?
[139:03.76]This is a mess.
[139:05.77]No, it doesn't.
[139:06.37]I thought you said I could complete, I could combine them.
[139:12.55]This is such a fucking mess.
[139:23.58]There has to be a medium walkthrough.
[139:32.04]Okay, I found one.
[139:38.62]No, this is only the first 20 minutes of the game.
[139:42.06]You can do this, I believe in you.
[139:43.24]I don't think I can.
[139:44.18]I think I'm too impatient to even spend 10 minutes on this.
[139:47.30]I can't do click maps.
[139:48.14]Look at how many spaces there are.
[139:56.64]What did I do?
[139:57.10]What did I go wrong?
[139:58.84]I did... I have no idea.
[140:01.16]Play something else.
[140:01.84]I'm almost on disk 4.
[140:03.21]I can't.
[140:03.55]Alright, what if I... Can I change it to easy?
[140:06.11]Easy?
[140:21.63]Sunk cost.
[140:23.53]It's like so stupid.
[140:27.46]I'm so pissed.
[140:33.02]Get me out.
[140:33.54]What happened?
[140:45.97]Medium!
[140:46.45]Medium!
[140:47.23]No.
[140:47.69]No.
[140:49.65]Nooooo!
[140:58.72]Jump to scene 24.
[140:59.54]On easy!
[141:07.69]It's tooming.
[141:10.63]Easy.
[141:10.93]Scene 24.
[141:11.87]Let's go!
[141:18.44]No, I don't want to change the game.
[141:19.45]I want to see what happens in the end.
[141:21.19]I'm on disk four.
[141:32.06]Wait, I still have to actually do this.
[141:33.12]It's supposed to be easy.
[141:49.78]Hold on.
[141:50.48]I think this person was playing on easy.
[141:59.82]Yeah, they were.
[142:00.16]Alright, this person was playing on easy.
[142:01.44]I got it.
[142:01.70]Okay, so then it goes like this.
[142:25.13]Okay, there's this blue, blue.
[142:26.75]Blue, blue.
[142:29.61]Blue, blue.
[142:30.15]Red, red.
[142:31.58]Green, green.
[142:33.26]Red, red.
[142:39.83]It's hard to even tell where the mirrors are, because this thing is at, like, fucking 200p.
[142:54.91]Alright, good.
[142:58.85]We don't have to do any more.
[142:59.67]We're done.
[142:59.93]That's it.
[143:10.25]Hey, Harry.
[143:11.23]Back on the observation deck when you were staring at that thing, what were you thinking about?
[143:15.29]I was deciding what to call this ship when I read it up in the log.
[143:18.33]Yeah, what's that hell hive, Kryn Motel?
[143:20.97]Daedalus.
[143:21.83]What?
[143:23.07]Ancient Greek mythology.
[143:24.65]To escape from the labyrinth, Daedalus made wings out of feathers and wax.
[143:27.83]Ow.
[143:28.23]Yeah, didn't he fly too close to the sun and scourge his ass?
[143:31.91]Marlon Brando?
[143:32.97]It kind of is.
[143:39.11]Yeah, the Daedalus Encounter.
[143:41.43]Need to find a way out of here.
[143:53.84]I'mma leave.
[143:55.36]Frump and Marlon Brando are, yes, they are one step away from each other.
[143:59.82]Bugs!
[144:01.40]Why are you shooting him?
[144:08.23]It's like, no, don't shoot me, and she shot it.
[144:11.19]Dude, she sucks.
[144:11.65]Oh, you love how my stream, when is he streaming command, is now ruined forever.
[144:37.34]That's supposed to be sense danger in sorcery.
[144:39.44]And now it's like, hey, I'm sus as to when he's streaming.
[144:54.24]Found something.
[144:57.86]Here comes a puzzle.
[144:58.84]I can't wait to do it very, very quickly.
[145:01.51]It's uneasy.
[145:16.70]Me light.
[145:19.75]What was it in... Well, isn't sus short for, like, suspect?
[145:24.63]Like, you suspect somebody?
[145:32.27]Yeah.
[145:34.21]I mean, in Sorcery, the spell was sense danger.
[145:41.23]Not like you are suspicious.
[145:45.60]Different.
[145:54.00]Sort of the same.
[145:55.24]It's a little the same.
[145:56.20]Not completely the same, though.
[146:05.00]Um, how deep does this go?
[146:06.16]At what point do I lose walkie-talkie frequency?
[146:17.31]Uh, look down?
[146:18.29]Should I look down?
[146:18.81]There's something down here.
[146:21.74]Oh no.
[146:23.12]It's a maze.
[146:25.81]Of course it is.
[146:33.73]Okay, so now... We're gonna go... Maybe analyze.
[146:42.09]Should I analyze the area?
[146:51.21]Analyze.
[146:52.41]Data.
[146:54.13]On.
[146:56.14]Analyze.
[146:56.46]Thrusters.
[146:57.44]Nope, I just have to get it right.
[146:58.40]I just have to guess.
[146:59.66]This is your colonoscopy.
[147:08.52]Yeah, pretty similar.
[147:13.71]Except, it'd be kind of weird to have multiple ways to go in your intestines.
[147:17.97]Found it.
[147:18.25]Got lucky there.
[147:23.63]Wait, I didn't.
[147:27.63]Really?
[147:35.94]This is no good.
[147:37.10]This is no good.
[147:40.28]I got to start keeping track of where I've been, but I have no idea where I've been.
[147:44.42]Every hallway is the same.
[147:45.20]I can't go up or down, right?
[147:54.04]I need a pen and paper.
[147:56.40]That's not a bad idea.
[148:00.48]Wall?
[148:03.80]Should I get out the pen and paper?
[148:17.27]I can't look up and I can't look down.
[148:23.64]Just use Microsoft Paint.
[148:25.38]So, what?
[148:25.98]I'm back.
[148:26.30]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[148:28.68]Okay, I'm gonna do paint.
[148:30.36]That's probably helpful.
[148:31.82]So, that's a wall.
[148:38.13]Where's paint?
[148:38.77]Shit, it's on the monitor behind me.
[148:41.75]God damn it.
[148:43.39]I can't even click it.
[148:44.05]It's on the monitor behind me.
[148:48.99]Like behind the- like I'm on a different source right now.
[148:52.41]Not behind me.
[148:53.23]I mean like behind the game.
[148:54.95]I'm on a different source.
[148:55.79]I'm on HDMI.
[148:56.51]I'm not on DVI because I'm capping it.
[149:11.02]Follow the right wall.
[149:12.78]I just tried to.
[149:14.28]Alright, I'm gonna follow the right wall.
[149:22.30]Follow right wall.
[149:25.40]Okay.
[149:25.96]I'm going.
[149:26.40]Wait, wouldn't going right again put me in a circle?
[149:42.62]Okay.
[149:43.56]Right again.
[149:51.45]S-Video, Scalar, HDMI, that's the one.
[149:53.85]I have a RetroTINK.
[149:55.93]So it's S-Video into the RetroTINK, and then HDMI from the RetroTINK into an Elgato, and then Elgato into the TV.
[150:03.67]Or to the monitor.
[150:06.21]I'm hugging the right wall.
[150:10.33]By the way, the RetroTINK is incredible.
[150:12.33]If you have an old console, it's the best one I've used so far.
[150:18.10]Without a doubt.
[150:21.71]I'm gonna try going... this way.
[150:28.93]The maze has pillars, you're fucked with the right wall.
[150:32.06]How did I even end up there?
[150:41.32]What?
[150:46.42]I'd rather watch you clean the bathroom than this.
[150:50.63]Just wait a minute.
[150:51.55]I'm interested.
[150:53.15]I need to play.
[150:53.93]This game sucks.
[150:55.69]Alright, I know.
[150:56.83]You don't think I know?
[150:57.53]I need... I'm... I'm enjoying it.
[151:00.79]I gotta get to disk 4.
[151:02.59]I can't just not see disk 4.
[151:03.87]Otherwise, that's so bad for me.
[151:05.49]Alright, hold on.
[151:10.56]Does this guy have the walkthrough of this?
[151:22.59]Where is it?
[151:22.93]Come on, show me.
[151:23.49]Alright, here he is.
[151:26.87]Okay, so he goes... Straight?
[151:37.51]Straight?
[151:38.05]How would you even figure this out?
[151:39.23]Straight, right?
[151:41.84]He ends up going down somehow.
[151:44.28]Actually, physically down.
[151:53.56]How much did this game add to the Jerma debt?
[151:55.48]Take, no.
[151:56.04]Alright, okay, okay, okay.
[151:57.26]I went down, I went down, I went down.
[152:00.57]I just went down.
[152:01.57]So wait, when he goes down, I want to see what happens.
[152:06.47]I want to get to the point where he goes down.
[152:10.27]Okay, he just went down.
[152:12.34]Now where does he go?
[152:13.60]From here.
[152:18.04]Every ResidentSleeper removes the debt by 5 million.
[152:20.76]Okay, and he goes left.
[152:27.33]Okay, he goes left.
[152:28.03]And then... After he goes left, he goes... Straight?
[152:40.90]He goes after going straight.
[152:43.54]Imagine being 12 and trying to do this on your own.
[152:47.36]Okay, after going straight, he goes straight again.
[152:55.26]And then it's a dead end for me.
[152:58.86]It's not a dead end for him.
[153:14.14]Why?
[153:17.34]No.
[153:19.22]What the?
[153:19.80]Wait.
[153:20.98]Dead end behind me?
[153:21.73]Dead end to the left?
[153:25.07]So, I can go straight then.
[153:26.83]So, right is a dead end.
[153:27.75]Behind me is a dead end.
[153:29.47]This way, right?
[153:30.27]Straight ahead.
[153:32.19]Straight ahead.
[153:32.69]This is it.
[153:33.01]This has to be it.
[153:34.03]Forward.
[153:37.23]Come on.
[153:38.55]Come on!
[153:43.32]Okay, so... Now what?
[153:55.68]Left or right?
[153:57.68]Left?
[154:02.89]Try right.
[154:03.31]Okay, I'll try right.
[154:13.22]god okay so then if we go straight straight would have been left so we're gonna go straight or right right we're gonna go right from here right no we're gonna left I don't know straight right from here is straight from when we first came down straight from here is left when we first came down so yeah let's go right
[154:45.94]No, that was wrong.
[154:46.58]That was wrong.
[154:46.88]Go back, back, back.
[154:47.52]Go back that way.
[154:48.84]That was wrong.
[154:53.80]So now we gotta go left.
[154:59.81]What?
[154:59.95]This is not even the right.
[155:00.93]This is not even correct.
[155:02.29]This wasn't underneath us before.
[155:06.33]What?
[155:23.48]I was just here.
[155:24.31]Okay, where am I from here?
[155:29.52]Straight.
[155:48.65]That was the worst noise?
[155:49.59]No, it was me clearing my, I don't know, left, left from here.
[155:57.65]I'm gonna get a fucking t-shirt for completing this game.
[156:01.58]That's dead end, man.
[156:02.72]You got that wrong, not left.
[156:12.78]Your brain is made for Bugsnax.
[156:14.53]Hey, we're playing Bugsnax tomorrow.
[156:24.33]Somebody said left again.
[156:25.19]Dude, this is... How is this... Even, like, 30 years ago, why is this fun?
[156:35.32]I understand, like, little puzzles.
[156:37.52]But the, like, guess which way you're going maze first person thing?
[156:41.90]Like, this is not even fun.
[156:58.02]How many people gave up at this maze?
[156:59.88]I even followed the walkthrough and it wasn't even right.
[157:09.68]You made us do three mazes.
[157:11.61]Yeah, but that was different though because there was like a thousand of... There was like 500 of you that could find it.
[157:16.39]There's only one of me here.
[157:18.43]If 500 other people were doing this, somebody would find it.
[157:27.40]Okay, now we... Get out of here.
[157:42.82]Get us out of here.
[157:43.54]But not yet.
[157:44.34]Hold on.
[157:44.74]I got to get to that fourth disk.
[157:46.04]We're like fucking 20 minutes away from the end of the goddamn game.
[157:49.06]I want to see it so bad.
[157:50.34]Don't you?
[157:51.30]No, none of you do.
[157:51.94]But I know you might.
[157:52.88]Maybe you do.
[158:00.47]This is a screensaver.
[158:01.63]If we go down, then we're on the right track.
[158:04.89]That's not down.
[158:05.75]Fuck.
[158:12.67]Watch it on YouTube?
[158:13.51]I did, and I followed the exact instructions.
[158:21.35]Stop turning.
[158:22.01]I just went straight twice!
[158:23.27]I just went straight twice!
[158:39.93]Go to the menu and start the maze with the walkthrough.
[158:42.17]I can't.
[158:48.98]Okay, I will.
[158:49.72]I will.
[158:50.06]But one second.
[158:50.92]Hold on.
[158:53.24]The game facts has a full map?
[159:03.25]It does?
[159:03.59]It does?
[159:05.97]Walkthrough.
[159:07.55]By Anonymous.
[159:09.47]Okay, yes.
[159:11.15]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[159:12.09]Where is it?
[159:14.69]Green.
[159:15.19]Okay, click.
[159:19.64]Next time, enter the hole and click the floodlight.
[159:21.70]This is the maze.
[159:22.56]Okay.
[159:23.24]Holy shit, this thing sucks.
[159:25.12]Are you kidding me?
[159:25.86]This is horrible.
[159:31.87]Okay, so where do you start?
[159:37.95]Hold on, can I... Okay, I can't paste it in here.
[159:49.60]Show it on screen?
[159:50.68]Hold on a second.
[159:54.66]Can I do it in a text box?
[159:55.84]That would be actually pretty funny if I could.
[159:57.30]Hold on.
[160:00.72]I hope I can.
[160:01.50]Yeah, I can.
[160:02.14]This is so funny.
[160:02.92]Alright.
[160:06.63]There you go.
[160:07.27]Here's the maze.
[160:10.15]That's what I have to look at.
[160:15.10]Hold on.
[160:15.52]No, it's not quite correct.
[160:25.40]Is the spacing right?
[160:26.22]It's the wrong font.
[160:31.94]What font is this?
[160:45.66]What the fuck is this?
[160:46.52]This is the map that's on the game facts.
[160:52.62]Is this even right?
[160:53.65]No, the spacing's wrong.
[160:56.15]The spacing's wrong.
[160:57.19]Hold on.
[161:00.63]Let me just take a screenshot of this.
[161:04.11]Hold on.
[161:04.89]Wait a sec.
[161:07.87]I gotta check.
[161:08.89]You know what?
[161:09.26]I'm gonna take a piss.
[161:09.96]I'll be right back.
[161:10.56]And I'm gonna get this on screen.
[161:11.60]I'll be right back.
[161:12.10]Pee time.
[161:12.86]Go pee.
[163:29.28]Okay, I'm back.
[163:30.40]And I'm ready.
[163:30.74]I'm back, and I'm ready.
[163:38.65]At the map.
[163:40.05]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[163:40.93]This is what it's supposed to look like.
[163:43.07]Not like that.
[163:45.41]It's supposed to look like this.
[163:46.55]So, I'm going to restart the chapter.
[163:57.20]What is farm?
[163:57.70]Farm.
[164:00.68]That's even worse.
[164:01.92]This is the maze.
[164:07.94]There's a map of the maze.
[164:12.22]Okay.
[164:16.88]Where do you start?
[164:17.62]This doesn't make any sense.
[164:23.68]No, I don't think it does, but maybe it might.
[164:27.36]What do you mean, who made this?
[164:28.54]Somebody like 20 years ago.
[164:30.87]Thank God they did, otherwise we'd be here forever, and I'd have to turn the video, I'd have to turn it off, and I don't want to turn it off.
[164:35.45]Alright, let's go.
[164:39.11]Thank God they did.
[164:39.83]Okay, so let's restart, go to the menu, and restart, and what is farm?
[164:57.03]Making ASCII is true dedication.
[165:00.61]And this is scene 26.
[165:01.27]That's when we want.
[165:02.39]Let's go.
[165:02.71]Alright.
[165:07.98]So, we're... This is... Where are we now?
[165:11.52]Farm?
[165:15.10]This has to be farm, right?
[165:22.55]Alright, we're in.
[165:23.93]Turn on the floodlight.
[165:25.67]Here we are.
[165:26.57]Okay.
[165:27.63]So, if we go straight.
[165:29.11]We can only go straight.
[165:32.54]So, straight... ...puts us with that cube.
[165:41.32]Where are we trying to go?
[165:42.22]I have no idea.
[165:45.59]Yeah, where does this go?
[165:47.31]Bottom right?
[165:47.79]Okay.
[165:49.75]Straight... ...then right.
[165:52.67]Right?
[165:53.91]We're trying to go to the corridor.
[165:56.28]We need to go straight all the way and then left.
[165:58.73]So we have to go straight again.
[166:01.95]And then straight again.
[166:02.65]And then straight again.
[166:08.55]No.
[166:08.91]What?
[166:12.01]Right now we are on cube... I don't know where we are.
[166:15.06]No, I know.
[166:15.54]I know.
[166:16.54]Right now we are cube two above farm.
[166:19.26]Straight up.
[166:22.96]So if we go up...
[166:26.45]We go straight again, then left, and then straight.
[166:33.28]Straight again puts us to the third square above farm.
[166:43.32]We're in square three above farm.
[166:46.24]We're going to go left.
[166:55.10]left will take us to that next one here I need to be like marking this I don't think I can though now we are on the one right before the long hallway up top and now but wait hold on does this is this direction does this take into account direction you're facing so is this technically straight on this one or is that left no it's straight right
[167:23.42]takes us across the pond.
[167:25.34]Correct?
[167:30.10]We're gonna go across the pond here.
[167:31.60]We're gonna go across and around and down and through and... That's not right.
[167:37.76]What?
[167:37.92]I don't know where I am.
[167:45.45]Okay.
[167:45.89]Now I'm... I don't know which way I'm facing.
[167:47.37]Start it over.
[167:47.83]I don't know which way I'm facing.
[167:49.01]I have no idea.
[167:53.69]Okay, so the idea is you go straight and then left immediately.
[167:58.59]That's why we were walking in circles, guys, because look at the four cubes that are above farm.
[168:04.70]How are you ever supposed to figure that out?
[168:06.54]Okay, here we go.
[168:16.56]I am going to go left immediately.
[168:23.05]That puts us right here.
[168:24.11]We're going to have to go straight.
[168:32.61]Straight here.
[168:37.25]That should take us across.
[168:38.31]But the line on the left... Alright, here we go.
[168:42.45]We're going down.
[168:44.93]Okay, we've made it.
[168:47.05]Now I need to go... Um...
[168:52.11]I don't understand if positional direction makes any sense.
[168:55.61]Straight again?
[168:56.15]No, it would have to be right.
[168:59.95]Because we came in that way, right?
[169:01.83]It would have to be right.
[169:05.92]And then we go straight.
[169:12.42]Okay, so now straight.
[169:16.72]Not right into the trash.
[169:22.33]Then we go straight again.
[169:26.64]Look at the chutes and ladders bullshit.
[169:29.02]If up here, if I take a right, it takes me all the way back down.
[169:35.94]Straight again.
[169:40.25]And then right.
[169:45.67]And we go right.
[169:52.25]Okay, I forget, I forget where we are.
[169:55.53]No, okay, when we go, I forget, I don't know where I am.
[169:57.33]Can we go right?
[169:57.89]I have no idea where I am.
[169:59.51]We go right, which puts us to the one right before the candy cane touches the top of it, right?
[170:05.42]Is that correct?
[170:09.28]Right, and then we bang a left.
[170:14.06]And then that should be into the top of the candy cane.
[170:19.18]The left should go into the candy cane.
[170:26.42]And then we go down through the candy cane.
[170:30.80]And we end up right next to the corridor.
[170:39.51]Now we go... That's not right.
[170:43.75]Oh, I don't know.
[170:44.21]I don't know.
[170:44.53]Straight?
[170:45.07]I think it's straight from here now.
[170:46.27]Right?
[170:48.44]Don't say right if you're agreeing with me.
[170:50.98]Say yes.
[170:52.14]Straight is the correct way now, right?
[170:55.53]No, don't say right.
[170:56.91]Straight is the correct way, yes?
[171:00.67]No, don't say right.
[171:02.07]Straight is the correct way, yes?
[171:08.19]No, are you saying right to go right?
[171:10.97]I don't know which way I'm facing on this map.
[171:14.96]Okay, so if I go straight here, I don't know, I have no idea where I am.
[171:18.58]If I go right, I'm gonna end up back down this stupid... Go straight.
[171:23.61]Straight will... Um... No, it's not straight.
[171:29.83]Is it?
[171:30.65]It's straight, it is.
[171:34.47]And then now we bang a left.
[171:36.86]We go left from here.
[171:42.02]Right, and now left.
[171:42.70]Left.
[171:49.21]And then straight.
[171:53.93]And that will take us through the corridor.
[171:57.67]So technically... We are... Okay, now straight.
[172:04.99]Straight.
[172:06.33]This is it!
[172:12.49]YES!
[172:17.32]Wow, that was awful.
[172:23.99]That was terrible.
[172:24.83]The screen's so messed up.
[172:36.38]What the fuck?
[172:37.12]Alright, Casey, you did it.
[172:38.34]They keep saying, I love you.
[172:43.34]Does another dead end?
[172:44.82]Come on, Zach, we've been in bad before.
[172:47.24]Remember that time on TACO 7 when we were pinned down by two FACAR squads?
[172:51.60]Yeah, how can I forget?
[172:53.12]Had us cold, fired down in a car, picking us apart from the ridge.
[172:56.92]Right, and when we were ready to give up, Casey said, there's no such thing as a hopeless situation.
[173:01.96]Rigs the engine to create a plasma burst, and boom, took them all out.
[173:08.42]Turn off R9K.
[173:09.00]Alright, this has got to be close.
[173:12.17]What's this one?
[173:13.43]Open this door.
[173:19.93]Alright, this one.
[173:20.57]Yup, I knew it.
[173:23.01]We're getting to the end.
[173:24.20]We're so close.
[173:24.84]I'm so glad.
[173:25.42]I'm going to be the only person on Twitch to have ever completed the Die Dallas encounter.
[173:30.70]No one else has beat this game on stream, and I will put any amount of money on that.
[173:34.70]But I'm not going to bet any money, because I could be wrong.
[173:38.39]This is not a bet, this is me just stating a statement that could be real.
[173:41.21]Disk 4, going in.
[173:53.39]Let's go.
[174:02.45]Disk 4.
[174:04.55]Yes!
[174:06.11]Why am I so excited about this?
[174:08.51]So this is called the purple door.
[174:11.03]Clicking on one of the black lines causes it to turn blue.
[174:14.79]The lock responds by turning one of the red lines red.
[174:18.05]Um, you know what?
[174:18.95]Just give me the lock, sir.
[174:19.57]I don't care.
[174:28.28]Okay, uh... Click, uh... This is really a game.
[174:33.84]You must form a closed path of four or longer before the computer does.
[174:36.90]It's very difficult.
[174:37.62]What?
[174:40.09]Did I spoil the game?
[174:42.34]Wait.
[174:54.64]I'm just gonna watch the video.
[174:55.40]I don't care.
[175:03.94]I just read a spoiler for, like, the end of the game, I think, on that walkthrough.
[175:08.38]Fuck.
[175:12.11]Alright, let's get it.
[175:12.89]Here we go.
[175:14.55]I just want to get to the end.
[175:15.61]I love it.
[175:16.91]I love it.
[175:17.49]Okay, so how do I do this puzzle?
[175:26.05]Oh shit, it has been three hours.
[175:29.97]I feel like it's been like ten minutes.
[175:31.35]It's been three hours?
[175:36.39]Okay, I'm just going to follow word for word the video.
[175:43.00]Worst stream 2020.
[175:43.88]No way.
[175:44.56]I disagree a thousand percent.
[175:46.70]No way.
[175:50.52]I'm just going to follow step by step in the video.
[175:53.72]Play the game.
[175:54.30]I'm about to.
[175:55.08]I'm about to play it very fast.
[175:56.48]Top five.
[176:02.32]Get out of here.
[176:03.00]No, it's not.
[176:03.74]This has been fun.
[176:05.10]What do you want about?
[176:05.78]The video is wrong.
[176:08.28]Of course it is.
[176:13.86]I just... what just happened?
[176:16.74]Is this like tic-tac-toe?
[176:25.91]What?
[176:31.63]This is really a game.
[176:32.38]You must form a closed path of four or longer before the computer does.
[176:44.27]It's like tic-tac-toe, but not.
[176:51.53]Shit.
[176:53.57]Uh.
[176:57.15]Oh my god.
[176:57.79]Give it to me!
[177:09.20]Give it to me!
[177:11.12]What?
[177:22.76]Don't do it.
[177:25.52]Don't you dare.
[177:28.36]Don't.
[177:30.24]I win!
[177:48.78]Fuck you.
[177:49.36]No.
[177:52.64]What's the Connect 4 guy say?
[177:54.00]Get off my back!
[177:55.90]It's something weird like that, right?
[178:17.66]Shit.
[178:18.02]Alright, I'm trying to get this way, over here.
[178:31.89]Did I win?
[178:39.06]This is going to be close.
[178:39.76]Ready?
[178:43.68]You dick.
[178:45.44]Wait, this is it right here.
[178:47.64]Go for the bottom.
[178:49.02]Go for the top.
[178:50.48]Go for it.
[178:57.52]I win!
[178:58.80]He says something weird.
[178:59.62]It's something like that.
[179:03.54]Good job, Casey.
[179:04.56]Get off!
[179:04.90]Somebody, give me it.
[179:05.50]What is it?
[179:06.06]What the hell didn't they put in moving walkways?
[179:09.03]Tell me, Zach, do you complain just to make conversation, or do you honestly enjoy it?
[179:14.28]Geez, Eric, my dogs are aching, okay?
[179:16.35]Have you no sympathy?
[179:17.53]Where's the voice?
[179:18.27]Not that.
[179:18.93]One of the Connect Four has eyes, mouth, and legs and stuff, and it talks.
[179:22.75]It says something.
[179:24.75]Casey, see if you can figure out what these panels are for.
[179:35.45]He's high.
[179:36.01]Hold that thought.
[179:39.84]What are you talking about?
[179:41.44]I'm about to prove all of you wrong.
[179:47.68]Connect for commercial.
[179:51.98]Everyone's about to be like, oh fuck, I'm so wrong, you're so right.
[179:57.35]Okay, here it comes.
[180:06.81]I'll take a... That shaves, at the very least, a hundred million dollars off the debt.
[180:13.32]A hundred million.
[180:14.62]Has to.
[180:25.21]I was so wrong.
[180:26.41]I was on drugs.
[180:27.17]I was high.
[180:27.83]I was fucked up.
[180:28.59]He's imagining worlds again.
[180:30.15]Nope.
[180:30.33]Alright, I gotta find a panel.
[180:40.76]Is there gonna be like a painting on one of these walls?
[180:44.54]Analyze.
[180:52.26]Slug.
[180:53.06]Found slug.
[180:58.91]Amorphous polysilicate comp.
[181:01.21]Photoreactive substrata.
[181:05.67]Okay.
[181:06.56]Open it up.
[181:10.18]Ooh!
[181:15.04]Blue.
[181:15.28]Did I get it?
[181:16.54]Green.
[181:30.96]Oh.
[181:34.02]Yellow.
[181:36.28]Blue.
[181:39.45]Green.
[181:46.99]Analyze.
[181:49.83]We haven't had a good +2 streak in an hour.
[181:51.61]I haven't tried to have a +2 streak, dude.
[181:53.75]I'm not trying to get a streak.
[182:00.71]Alright, blue, red, green.
[182:10.77]Did I analyze this, like the big penis?
[182:27.36]Pattern data saved.
[182:29.98]Alright, what do we got?
[182:35.01]I think those are the only two on this panel.
[182:38.35]What about this one?
[182:44.49]Green.
[182:45.94]Ooh, scan that.
[182:52.70]Dulleswim is streaming Samurai Jack on YouTube right now if you guys want to head over there right now.
[182:56.50]No, don't go there.
[182:57.48]Stay here.
[183:02.47]Okay, now... Orange.
[183:05.09]Ooh!
[183:05.47]Scan that.
[183:05.83]Okay.
[183:16.48]Anymore?
[183:23.20]Just lost a bunch of people.
[183:24.22]No!
[183:24.50]I'm fine!
[183:28.58]They ain't going anywhere.
[183:29.65]Okay?
[183:30.01]They ain't going anywhere.
[183:31.17]No one's leaving.
[183:38.40]Cope.
[183:38.68]Cope.
[183:38.98]Cope.
[183:39.20]It's not Cope.
[183:39.79]No one's going anywhere.
[183:44.95]Okay.
[183:46.57]Blue.
[183:49.23]I kind of don't understand what this wants me to do though.
[183:54.83]Alright.
[183:59.58]Now what?
[184:03.28]Data.
[184:03.60]I have like all these pictures in my data.
[184:10.80]Dude, that's a weed leaf.
[184:12.80]Yeah, that's a good one.
[184:18.18]How many more pictures are there?
[184:27.25]Everyone left but you and me.
[184:28.51]That would be so funny.
[184:31.49]It's just me and you.
[184:33.60]Nobody else.
[184:34.54]Just us.
[184:43.34]Okay, that was orange.
[184:52.28]That's it.
[184:52.66]There's only two pictures per panel.
[184:54.44]I think that's it.
[184:54.92]Oh, there's one more panel here.
[185:03.25]Oh!
[185:04.29]Another panel!
[185:12.16]He can't even say hello to his only viewer.
[185:16.19]I'll be honest with you, I don't even remember what their name was.
[185:23.65]Okay, what's the walkthrough say?
[185:26.31]What?
[185:41.36]What do you mean translate?
[185:50.04]Uh... What do you mean translate?
[185:58.64]X?
[186:03.67]You missed one.
[186:04.45]I did?
[186:04.77]No, I don't wanna...
[186:14.73]Why do you hate us so much?
[186:18.15]I don't.
[186:18.45]Am I going to play something else?
[186:24.67]Yeah, once I get to the end of this, we're putting in blade force.
[186:28.59]Go around for that one.
[186:31.56]Uh, I don't even, I don't understand.
[186:35.58]Okay, I'm just telling you guys right now, right after this next sentence in the walkthrough, I see the words finale.
[186:43.62]So, we just have to, uh, literally watch the video of how the person doing this.
[186:58.31]Yeah, well, the finale is right after this.
[186:59.97]Whatever it is.
[187:00.41]Alright, what the fuck does this even want me to do?
[187:12.33]Alright, so you go to each panel, you scan each picture.
[187:15.46]And then... I think I leave.
[187:22.16]How do I just leave?
[187:22.70]How do I get away?
[187:25.04]Can't leave.
[187:28.47]Leave!
[187:31.19]How do I fucking leave?
[187:42.62]What is this game called, actually?
[187:43.72]It's called the Die Dallas Encounter.
[187:48.22]I got them all.
[187:48.74]This is horrible.
[187:52.17]Yes, I know.
[187:52.93]This game is absolute, utter dog shit.
[187:56.41]I know, but I'm at disk four, and I'm gonna win.
[188:05.27]Is there one that I didn't scan?
[188:07.11]Did I not scan this one?
[188:16.04]You get it?
[188:16.38]I think we should check this out.
[188:20.76]Fuck.
[188:23.62]What the f- At this- At this, just- Uh, this- No.
[188:27.54]Like, what the- What?
[188:29.68]How would you even know what to do here?
[188:38.79]How- Like, what- Translate.
[188:41.71]What do you mean, translate?
[188:50.43]What am I supposed to be translating?
[188:56.65]I wish I could just fucking get a save state and skip this because this is just... Why would you ever know what to do here?
[189:06.13]This is stupid.
[189:10.57]On their video, this is easy too.
[189:15.14]And they have like a weird interface.
[189:17.84]I don't have like a PC interface.
[189:19.84]Data.
[189:20.26]How do I like even do this?
[189:23.36]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[189:24.44]Okay, green, blue, yellow.
[189:30.01]Yeah, sure.
[189:31.83]What the fuck do you want me to do?
[189:45.34]Huh?
[189:58.83]Grandpa, hit the enter key.
[190:00.05]Did we scan this one?
[190:04.49]Maybe we have to scan them all.
[190:07.37]I don't remember the guy leaning over the sphere.
[190:09.23]This is painful.
[190:12.03]Unplug it.
[190:17.28]Yeah, symbol... Pull the plug, pull the plug.
[190:27.43]Is it weird that I can't because I have to spite to finish this game?
[190:31.59]I definitely didn't see this one.
[190:32.57]Okay, now I got that.
[190:41.70]I got it.
[190:45.64]Sunk cost.
[190:47.61]Well, it's not sunk cost if you eventually get to the end.
[191:03.79]Somewhere, somewhere in the world is somebody really embarrassed this game exists.
[191:08.97]Like, they like fucking designed and programmed this game shit-faced every day.
[191:25.25]I probably don't even remember that they made this.
[191:27.58]They hotboxed the office.
[191:28.96]I can't, dude.
[191:34.66]This doesn't even make any fucking sense.
[191:39.14]Even the walkthrough doesn't make any sense.
[191:44.03]Pattern saved.
[191:44.79]Yeah, I mean, I know I have like these patterns in this, but what am I supposed to do with them?
[191:57.70]I can't even leave the slabs.
[192:07.58]Enhance it.
[192:08.62]I have this data ship, but I can't even interact with it.
[192:17.37]I'm getting close.
[192:18.17]I'm getting close to ripping it out.
[192:19.43]You're right.
[192:19.83]I'm getting really close.
[192:20.63]It's going to happen.
[192:22.85]I'm getting close to ripping it out.
[192:30.44]But we're on the last fucking disk.
[192:33.74]I'm so close to ripping it out and just frisbeeing it.
[192:40.28]What the fuck is this?
[192:41.64]Okay, hold on.
[192:51.14]This is where he is in the story.
[192:52.10]And then he moves to the left.
[193:03.01]Hold on.
[193:03.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[193:03.97]I think I got it.
[193:04.47]I think it's over.
[193:11.74]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[193:12.84]This is where he is.
[193:13.40]Did he scan?
[193:21.23]Did I scan this one?
[193:31.33]We're almost done.
[193:34.13]Check this shit out.
[193:34.67]Here we go.
[193:36.61]I've got that one scanned.
[193:37.47]I've got to scan one more.
[193:39.83]Scan this one.
[193:47.05]That's it.
[193:53.65]That's it.
[194:00.86]Is that it?
[194:07.91]I fucking scan- I scan these already!
[194:14.49]What does he do?
[194:17.29]Translation?
[194:21.63]Wait, he's doing the same thing I'm doing.
[194:23.14]He's just going around in circles for like 15 straight minutes.
[194:26.78]He leaves!
[194:28.44]How do I leave?
[194:30.68]How do I leave?
[194:34.50]How the fuck do I leave?
[194:35.60]He clicks down with a mouse and clicks the bottom of the screen and leaves.
[194:40.12]I can't do that.
[194:40.68]How do I leave?
[194:49.89]He has like an I can leave button.
[194:55.39]How do I fucking leave?
[194:56.87]Rust?
[194:58.23]Rust?
[195:02.78]Please let me leave!
[195:06.80]What the fuck?
[195:07.80]Why would I finish stuff like this and not Resident Evil 2?
[195:13.25]I did Resident Evil 2 on my own.
[195:17.45]Plus, this is- Resident Evil 2 is like a nine hour game.
[195:20.45]This is like three and a half hours.
[195:21.69]Okay, how do I physically get the fuck out of this fucking- I'm so mad right now.
[195:28.60]How do I- No!
[195:33.03]You don't have the achievements for Claire.
[195:34.25]Shut up!
[195:36.03]No, that didn't just happen, did it?
[195:37.12]Oh my god.
[195:44.06]Why can't I just back up from the fucking podium?
[195:48.06]Did they forget to program it into the 3DO?
[195:49.66]I don't think- I think they forgot to program that into the 3DO version of the game.
[196:06.26]I'm not even going to go over here.
[196:07.24]I'm not going to click on any of this shit.
[196:12.67]No, no, no, no.
[196:14.49]Shut up.
[196:16.81]No, I refuse.
[196:17.75]Okay, I did it.
[196:21.25]I'm done.
[196:22.45]That was fun.
[196:22.81]Now get me out.
[196:45.50]I'm so mad.
[196:47.60]I feel like I have to quit this fucking trash can of a video game.
[197:00.25]Just wait, hold on.
[197:07.32]Good job, Casey.
[197:11.74]My feet are starting to hurt, Airy.
[197:13.56]Why the hell didn't they put in moving walkways?
[197:16.08]Everybody relax.
[197:16.88]Everybody relax.
[197:17.76]Everybody relax.
[197:19.06]Or do you honestly enjoy it?
[197:21.68]Jeez, Airy, my dogs are aching, okay?
[197:23.82]Have you no sympathy?
[197:24.68]Everybody relax.
[197:25.30]I'm saving my sympathy for you when you'll really need it.
[197:28.54]When you run out of things to complain about.
[197:30.54]Wait, hold on.
[197:31.16]Everybody relax for a second.
[197:32.25]Casey, see if you can figure out what these panels are for.
[197:45.65]I already have all this data.
[197:49.35]I already have all the data.
[197:52.75]Okay, so now... I've got the data.
[198:02.30]Forgot it all.
[198:04.02]So now... I've got... I've looked at it all.
[198:08.97]Yes.
[198:09.41]Somebody has a YouTube link.
[198:10.41]I wonder what is it.
[198:11.17]This better not be like a screamer.
[198:13.53]Puzzle tutorial.
[198:14.41]Hold on.
[198:20.59]It has a link to the puzzle.
[198:42.63]This is fake.
[198:42.97]This has to be fake.
[198:44.01]I knew it.
[198:44.63]I knew it.
[198:45.05]I knew it.
[198:46.17]It's probably the same guy that made the monkey one.
[199:35.42]Am I mic muted?
[199:37.80]Actually muted.
[199:38.46]Oh, I think I broke something.
[199:40.14]Did you hear me?
[199:43.36]Mic was muted the whole time.
[199:44.72]Did you hear me?
[199:45.16]Hello?
[199:53.68]What keeps happening?
[199:58.57]Was I just cutting in and out over and over again?
[200:01.05]That was weird.
[200:06.92]Alright.
[200:08.12]What do I do, though?
[200:09.45]Oh, I've already scanned it.
[200:10.47]Data.
[200:13.89]Data.
[200:14.35]Wait.
[200:15.51]Hold on.
[200:24.60]Call the one at the tutorial.
[200:26.90]I can't, because he just goes by and scans everything, and then he leaves.
[200:30.80]I can't leave.
[200:37.39]Nidal's encounter.
[200:38.65]Give me another walkthrough.
[200:40.75]The GameFAQs one doesn't help at all.
[200:50.39]There's another one.
[200:54.42]No, I've already seen that one.
[200:55.80]Find one for the 3DO.
[200:59.12]If it even exists.
[201:03.02]You found one.
[201:05.94]Alright, I'm not- I'm gonna find it myself.
[201:09.42]A Dallas Encounter walkthrough.
[201:11.32]Maybe the walkthrough king can help.
[201:14.52]We tried walkthrough king before.
[201:18.92]Okay.
[201:22.76]At the panel in front of you, click each of your colored buttons and a picture may be displayed.
[201:27.76]You are looking for one with three symbols beneath it.
[201:31.08]Orange, green, and yellow.
[201:36.02]What?
[201:47.21]I think the walkthrough king helped us.
[201:51.87]The walkthrough king has got us.
[201:53.05]We just gotta find them with orange, green, and yellow on anything and I win.
[201:56.98]Not that one.
[201:57.36]Stop saying fuck you to me.
[202:03.10]Don't say that.
[202:03.60]It's not nice.
[202:05.86]Orange, green, and yellow.
[202:09.22]Orange, green, yellow.
[202:13.74]That's not a nice thing to say to somebody.
[202:14.90]What you should be saying is, you're great.
[202:23.38]Guys.
[202:26.70]I'm turning the ego stream on right now.
[202:29.74]And you have to adhere to it because I just said it.
[202:35.55]It's happening right now.
[202:38.55]I have activated the ego stream for the remainder of the evening.
[202:46.76]So now, what are you gonna do now, wizard?
[202:53.34]Oh, that'll do it.
[202:54.46]I'm a funny character.

[205:29.64]What are you supposed to do with this info?
[205:32.08]Click on an egg at the bottom.
[205:34.28]Egg?
[205:41.45]Alright, this one's in Russian, but I think it's a 3DO.
[205:44.71]This is disk 4.
[205:45.55]Disk 4.
[205:46.21]It's in Russian, but it doesn't matter.
[205:50.91]And this is, in fact, on the 3DO.
[205:54.22]This is on the 3DO.
[205:58.90]Okay, what does he do?

[206:17.21]Okay, and then he goes to the hand.
[206:20.35]No, he goes to the light and he... Why does it skip?
[206:31.01]His video actually skips.
[206:35.78]Hold on a minute.
[206:49.19]Why does nobody want to show me this?
[206:54.27]I don't care if I'm here all day.
[206:55.27]I need to figure out why this is happening.
[207:00.21]We're at the end of the fucking game.
[207:06.80]Oh, his video says this is disk four of five.
[207:13.98]Wait, what?
[207:16.02]I don't have a fifth disk.
[207:16.98]Okay, here we go.
[207:19.24]Explain to me what's going on here.

[208:07.78]He scans this.
[208:10.92]And then... Then possible data language.
[208:14.32]And then it skips again.

[214:23.80]I pressed all the- I pressed all the lights.
[214:25.16]Now I have to watch her fucking walk across the fucking thing again.
[214:40.15]Just watch the speedrun.
[214:42.55]I don't need that right now.
[214:44.90]Oh my god.
[214:47.96]If you have a big red button, you say, press big red button, and I press it and it doesn't do anything.
[214:57.33]But then I have to play Simon Says with the button.
[214:59.13]How am I supposed to know I'm supposed to do that?
[215:11.38]You guys are not being incredibly nice.
[215:17.99]Just always assume what Simon says.
[215:19.45]Okay, so just match the color of whatever is on the screen.
[215:29.06]If this is wrong, then it's your fault if we have to watch her go across the balance beam again.
[215:42.80]Fuck you.
[215:44.12]I'm going to go watch a furry movie.
[215:48.63]I don't even know.
[215:55.37]What is a furry movie?
[215:56.43]Is it any movie that has Looney Tunes count?
[216:01.00]Go watch Space Jam.
[216:03.14]Here we go.
[216:09.83]Red.
[216:11.84]Didn't work.
[216:12.78]Kink.
[216:13.62]Didn't work.
[216:15.34]None of these work, actually.
[216:16.46]None of them do.
[216:16.94]And I can't control anything.
[216:18.00]Fork.
[216:18.40]Fork.
[216:18.79]Fork.
[216:19.17]Fork.
[216:19.67]Data.
[216:20.13]Any of the data.
[216:20.79]Analyze.
[216:21.27]Yes.
[216:21.71]No.
[216:22.31]Press every button.
[216:23.35]No.
[216:23.73]No.
[216:24.09]Nothing works.
[216:24.83]Absolutely nothing works.
[216:26.13]No buttons work.
[216:26.69]Yes.
[216:27.11]No.
[216:27.43]Yes.
[216:27.91]No.
[216:28.29]Can't move a cursor.
[216:28.97]I can't do anything.
[216:34.72]I clicked the fork probably 30 or 40 times.
[216:36.40]Thruster.
[216:43.10]Hold on a second.
[217:01.93]Okay, so explain to me what's going on here.
[217:04.39]While we watch the cutscene for like a fifth time.
[217:07.31]What's happening here?
[217:15.36]I'm gonna watch that guy's walkthrough again.
[217:18.76]This guy has no idea that he's saving this stream.
[217:24.01]Alright, so what happens?
[217:27.29]It's so close.
[217:50.30]Okay, so here we are.
[217:51.36]The lasers.
[217:54.08]Okay, here we go.
[218:02.15]So he... He has like a data thing up.
[218:09.61]What data?
[218:10.15]Wait, what's that?
[218:10.83]What is this?
[218:11.29]Data.
[218:18.24]I don't have this one.
[218:20.98]I don't have the one he has on screen.
[218:25.98]This is pink, green, orange.
[218:31.95]I don't have his data thing.
[218:34.53]Work this panel, see if you can stop this thing.
[218:39.47]What?
[218:49.19]I don't have that.
[218:53.33]Am I actually softlocked?
[218:58.20]I think I might be.
[219:00.86]Orange, green, yellow, you mean.
[219:04.86]Wait, what?
[219:06.62]I do have it?
[219:07.24]I don't have it.
[219:21.67]Watch the speedrun again.
[219:22.63]He just has it open.
[219:26.21]It has pink, green, orange.
[219:29.38]Pink, green, orange is what he has for, like, a thing for data up.
[219:33.64]And then it just completes it.
[220:16.99]I'm so mad.
[220:20.88]Why do I not have this, like, data disk that he has?
[220:27.84]Where did he get this?
[220:28.62]And why don't I not have it?
[220:32.50]I do?
[220:34.14]He has pink, green, orange, blue, yellow, red for his data disk.
[220:42.39]I have it?
[220:42.99]I do not have this.
[220:45.59]Pink, green, orange.
[220:49.53]This is yellow, orange, pink, blue, pink, yellow.
[220:55.64]I don't have it.
[220:56.28]I think we should check this out.
[221:02.42]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[221:03.72]That's a long way down there.
[221:06.78]Yellow, orange, pink.
[221:09.03]I don't fucking have this.
[221:12.27]Be careful.
[221:15.29]You're on easy.
[221:19.33]Yeah, but what does that mean?
[221:20.57]What does that matter?
[221:21.13]Pink, green.
[221:25.60]Stop fucking gaslighting me.
[221:27.04]I don't have this one.
[221:27.96]This is a purple outline.
[221:37.91]This one has a blue outline.
[221:40.19]Yours is yellow, orange, green.
[221:42.34]What are you talking about?
[221:43.64]Leave me alone.
[221:45.34]Leave me alone.
[221:45.90]I don't understand what's happening.
[221:49.18]Try them all.
[221:50.56]Yeah.
[221:53.98]Not gaslighting.
[221:54.90]Yes, you are.
[221:55.68]Of course you are.
[221:56.52]Okay, what's going on?
[221:59.63]Okay, I'm going to try them all.
[222:05.03]What the hell's going on?
[222:06.09]I know some kind of barrier won't let me out.
[222:09.72]Are the ones with the blue outline.
[222:15.07]It's not gonna work, Tia.
[222:17.25]Okay, here we go.
[222:22.83]It's up.
[222:29.36]No, I don't have it!
[222:36.72]Every holographic that I have doesn't work!
[222:41.55]I can't because nothing works.
[222:48.48]What the fuck?
[222:56.14]What is this?
[222:57.50]Please stop playing.
[223:10.84]I don't understand.
[223:13.16]What's happening?
[223:14.86]I feel like I'm losing my mind on stream.
[223:17.71]And the dog's barking at me.
[223:19.91]You guys are yelling at me.
[223:20.87]He's yelling at me.
[223:22.73]Should I put it on medium?
[223:23.77]Alright, what if I put this on medium just for this scene?
[223:27.93]Will it change?
[223:28.65]Okay, I put it on medium.
[223:40.29]No, it doesn't matter.
[223:42.74]I'm softlocked.
[223:45.34]The solution was right in front of your eyes.
[223:50.50]It's not your fault you have to go back and scan the purple door.
[223:53.32]What?
[223:54.04]What do you mean scan the fucking purple door?
[223:56.06]What are you talking about?
[224:00.15]Go to the previous scene.
[224:04.25]No.
[224:06.57]Hold on, Otto's like, let me in.
[224:09.41]Go to the previous scene?
[224:12.05]Scene 28.
[224:13.95]What?
[224:14.31]Hold on.
[224:15.06]I gotta let Otto in.
[224:21.44]Good job, Casey.
[224:25.89]My feet are starting to hurt, Harry.
[224:27.71]Why the hell didn't they put in moving walkways?
[224:30.06]What do I have to do?
[224:30.70]I didn't scan the door?
[224:31.46]What?
[224:31.66]Okay.
[224:31.94]I didn't scan the door.
[224:32.81]Scan what door?
[224:34.13]I can't scan a door.
[224:35.81]Scan the blue rune.
[225:01.12]I need pink, green, orange.
[225:04.74]Purple door.
[225:05.26]I can't scan anything.
[225:06.04]I have to go back another scene?
[225:12.63]No.
[225:14.01]Scene 27.
[225:15.05]Oh, you're kidding me.
[225:15.71]I have to go... What?
[225:28.12]What?
[225:29.99]I have to do this again?
[225:30.71]Wait, why?
[225:34.31]No, this is not right.
[225:44.02]This is not right.
[225:45.46]It shouldn't be like this.
[225:49.91]No, it shouldn't be like this.
[225:53.92]I don't want to do this.
[225:55.10]I just want to win.
[225:55.86]I just don't want to do these stupid puzzles again.
[225:58.79]I can't believe I fucking softlocked myself.
[226:06.05]I'm so angry about softlocking myself.
[226:09.50]That I am distraught right now.
[226:18.98]Okay.
[226:20.58]I can't scan anything right now.
[226:21.65]I'm in the middle of a puzzle.
[226:28.28]I can't scan it.
[226:30.60]I could, I had no option to scan it.
[226:43.06]No, I have to go back on full disk.
[226:46.86]I can't.
[227:00.68]What happened?
[227:04.92]This is bullshit.
[227:11.46]I didn't scan one of these doors so therefore the game is soft locked.
[227:21.22]No, no, no, no.
[227:23.47]Nope.
[227:24.93]Nope.
[227:25.89]No, not doing this again.
[227:27.19]No.
[227:29.13]No.
[227:33.57]It's not softlocked.
[227:38.33]Wait, what is it?

[229:26.52]And I saved over it with this fucking image.
[229:39.29]Okay, I'm being quiet and I'm going to beat this really quickly.
[229:41.43]Here we go.
[229:43.81]And I'm scanning that stupid ass purple fucking door.
[229:46.20]Let's go, go, go, go, go.

[229:49.84]Shh, I'm quiet, quiet.
[229:55.74]Oh, I did it wrong.
[230:24.88]Wait, no, no, start it over, start it over, start it over, start it over, start it over, start it over, start it over, start it over, start it over.

[231:32.24]Oh, I... And then, I don't know.
[231:35.60]I don't, I don't, I forget.
[231:37.58]I forget already.
[231:40.70]I forget already.
[231:41.20]I think it's right.
[231:42.30]No, where is it?
[231:43.00]Where am I?
[231:47.26]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[231:48.36]I went straight.
[231:50.40]This is at the end of that hallway, so I go right.
[231:55.74]I don't remember.
[231:56.52]I don't remember.
[231:57.90]Can you imagine making this game?
[231:59.90]Oh, just stop.
[232:00.50]Stop, like, talking shit and just do it.
[232:15.25]Straight.
[232:21.79]Straight.

[233:01.79]They're trying to follow this map.
[233:06.73]I don't know where I am now though.
[233:08.09]Where am I now?
[233:09.13]People are trying to follow along with their own maps.
[233:13.44]I have no idea where I am in this map.
[233:17.54]You finished what you fucking started.
[233:29.91]There is a map with the starting location.
[233:33.65]If this is a picture of my ass, I'm going to be mad.
[233:40.58]You made this bed, now lie in it.
[233:42.60]No, I didn't.
[233:43.68]I got to the end of a game that was made 25 years ago when they forgot how- Whatever.
[233:54.22]This is like the stone age of making video games.
[233:56.87]They were bashing their computers with fucking stone tools.
[234:01.73]That's how old and shitty this is.
[234:14.19]Going to the maze and turn on the floodlight.
[234:17.85]This is so much easier than a fucking map.
[234:30.56]Go into the maze, turn on the floodlight.
[234:31.88]Forward, forward, left, forward, left, left, left, right, forward.
[234:34.34]You're out of there.
[234:35.04]Thank you.
[234:40.14]Forward.
[234:42.12]Forward.
[234:51.81]Left.
[235:05.43]Forward.
[235:10.97]Wait, what'd I just do?
[235:11.79]It's forward, right?
[235:12.52]Left?
[235:12.82]No.
[235:13.22]Forward.
[235:13.54]Ah, left.
[235:14.28]Forward.
[235:14.56]Forward, forward, left, forward.
[235:18.68]And then left three times.
[235:22.12]One hop this time.
[235:23.98]Two hops this time.
[235:24.98]Freestyle.
[235:30.55]I forgot where I am.
[235:31.27]Left three times.
[235:35.73]Double dream hand.
[235:38.49]Put your hand over there.
[235:42.03]Left.
[235:42.57]Left.
[235:49.78]Left.
[235:56.24]How many lefts is that?
[235:57.37]That was two lefts, right?
[235:58.43]I forgot.
[235:59.17]I actually do.
[235:59.83]I'm so fucked up right now.
[236:01.87]How many lefts is that?
[236:02.61]There's one more left, right?
[236:07.92]That's it.
[236:08.66]Left and then a right.
[236:10.10]And then forward.
[236:11.38]So they go right and then forward.
[236:17.42]Okay, right.
[236:19.42]And then... Let's just relax, you know?
[236:21.70]Let's just chill.
[236:24.62]Before I swallow my own head.
[236:26.80]And now forward.
[236:28.10]Stop playing this shit-ass game, Jesus Christ.
[236:32.21]I will.
[236:33.27]Forward.
[236:34.11]Alright, and now we're out of there.
[236:36.19]Okay, now scan the fucking door.
[236:50.56]I'm begging you to stop.
[236:51.52]Just hold on.
[236:53.30]We're almost out.
[236:56.16]Scan this door.
[236:57.12]I get the cube.
[237:00.24]I will not forget the door.

[238:04.80]And there it is.
[238:06.48]That's the, I have the three.
[238:08.18]Oh God, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[238:25.47]Alright, this is it.
[238:26.95]It's time to end this.
[238:29.32]It's time for this to end.
[238:32.22]I think I just put in just two.
[238:52.17]Okay, now I know what to do.
[238:53.65]I've got everything settled and ready to go.

[241:48.99]Yeah, the shit's all in the database already.
[241:57.52]Just activate them.
[241:58.28]Yeah, I think I just have to have seen them.
[242:04.99]And then we can finally move on to the end of the game.
[242:18.69]Okay, we've seen it.
[242:19.61]We've seen these.
[242:20.17]I don't have disk 5.
[242:25.89]That doesn't exist.
[242:26.57]I'm gonna yell at that person.
[242:30.37]Everyone yell at that person.
[242:40.83]Okay, good.
[242:41.13]We got that one now.
[242:41.77]Look at this one.
[242:47.35]Wait, what are you doing?
[242:53.99]Everybody yell.
[242:55.35]Alright, here it is.
[242:56.99]Alright, we're good.
[242:58.81]Okay.
[243:00.59]Okay.
[243:00.71]Okay.
[243:02.87]Let's see if you can figure out what's going on here.
[243:06.53]Okay.
[243:07.11]What?
[243:07.86]Look at that.
[243:12.60]They're starting to re.
[243:15.08]Stop re.
[243:16.96]Don't re in my face ever again.
[243:27.86]Okay, scan this one.
[243:28.75]Thank you.
[243:34.31]Scan, scan, scan, scan.
[243:35.61]Then we go left, then we go left, then we go left, and it's over.
[243:44.72]Wait, I have to look at these.
[243:58.11]Okay, we're done.
[243:58.95]That's it.
[244:02.91]Left.
[244:03.93]Left.
[244:05.61]Left.
[244:07.61]Left.
[244:10.51]Left.
[244:14.08]Left.
[244:17.14]Left.
[244:28.10]The MCA?
[244:28.66]What?
[244:35.35]What happened?
[244:38.25]These are already scanned.
[244:39.27]I already scanned them all.
[244:40.25]They're already in my database.
[244:59.15]have to left okay I'm gonna do exactly what I did last time I scanned that one and then I just went left three times this has been quite a journey
[245:19.18]He's still here.
[245:19.98]No, this game sucks asshole.
[245:23.12]So if you do not do a very specific thing of sequences, you cannot finish the game.
[245:27.98]So let's just get that really clear for that person that just showed up.
[245:37.29]Where's the one that I have to do exactly?
[245:40.85]Game sucks, gotta finish it.
[245:41.99]Well, now it's kind of like, remember, um, remember Clock Tower?
[245:44.07]Remember we got, like, two-thirds of the way through Clock Tower, and I was like, I hate this, but now it's like, oh, this is kind of fun at the same time, though.
[245:51.14]So I've had, I had to finish it.
[246:00.37]Where is that stupid panel with the symbol that I have to scan this and then go left three times?
[246:10.85]You're having fun yet?
[246:11.84]Okay.
[246:21.68]Here we go.
[246:22.02]Ready?
[246:22.40]Scan this.
[246:23.61]And then move left three times.
[246:25.25]That's what I did last time.
[246:30.23]There are patterns.
[246:31.35]Left.
[246:34.13]Left.
[246:34.33]Left.
[246:37.28]Left.
[246:40.70]Left.
[246:47.36]You didn't scan the blank object?
[246:58.66]This- all these things have already been scanned.
[247:00.04]I'm like replaying it.
[247:03.28]What's wrong with the mic quality?
[247:04.10]I don't know.
[247:04.78]Apparently this thing's fucked up, I guess.
[247:10.24]Okay.
[247:12.37]So, last time I did this, I went left three times, and then it just went to the cutscene.
[247:16.81]Now I did left three times and didn't do anything.
[247:22.34]I just went left twice, so it's like... Don't... Go into the menu.
[247:30.76]What do you mean?
[247:33.04]Go to the menu.
[247:36.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[247:37.00]Hold on a second.
[247:37.80]Are you telling me that you think that I, now that I have this in the computer system, that I can just skip to the next scene?
[247:47.99]Wait a minute.
[247:50.97]Oh, shit.
[247:51.75]I think we may have just found a loophole.
[248:11.57]Let's go.
[248:12.41]Let's go.
[248:13.25]Let's go.
[248:14.09]Let's go.
[248:14.45]You guys fucking... Ow.
[248:15.49]You guys pumped?
[248:21.22]Purple.
[248:42.31]What was that demon noise?
[248:43.33]Somebody's mic was messed up.
[248:53.26]Game sucks.
[248:53.96]Fucking get out of this game.
[248:55.76]We will.
[248:56.82]We're so close to the end.
[248:59.42]Worst noise from the worst stream.
[249:02.66]That's not even accurate.
[249:04.53]Guys, you can't just say every stream is the worst stream.
[249:07.67]That's not how that works.
[249:09.13]You're all in big trouble.
[249:14.85]This one actually is Omega Lava.
[249:23.54]Alright, here we go!
[249:24.76]Thank you!
[249:25.18]Alright, did it.
[249:26.14]Let's see the end.
[249:51.37]I'm taking her gun and putting it in a bag.
[249:52.85]They're going to fall out of that bag.
[249:58.69]That's what happens when you put the milk in like... That's a bad grocery bag packing.
[250:08.34]If you put your milk inside of a bag like that and you don't have anything else to put the weight on the other side, you're going to fuck yourself up.
[250:30.18]Now full thrust.
[250:32.40]You guys thought this was porn week?
[250:35.03]This is torture week.
[250:37.47]Where I torture you on screen.
[250:44.05]Same thing.
[250:52.13]Can't wait for Bugsnax tomorrow.
[250:55.16]I still have a lot of 3DO games to play.
[250:57.54]Maybe we'll go back to 3DO on Sunday.
[250:59.49]No?
[250:59.63]What?
[250:59.93]I'm playing Bugsnax tomorrow.
[251:26.77]What does he even think?
[251:35.78]Is he talking about Bugsnax?
[251:38.02]Oh, he hates Bugsnax.
[251:44.71]I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[251:46.61]He hates it.
[251:59.91]Okay, now... Where... Where are we going now?
[252:10.23]Why are we going so slow?
[252:19.14]This is very... There's no sense of urgency at all.
[252:32.22]Are we gonna get a final boss reveal here?
[252:39.73]Guess that just about does it then, huh?
[252:50.39]What are you talking about?
[252:53.04]In case you haven't noticed, Eri, we've gone to all six doors.
[252:56.82]We're fresh out of options.
[252:57.74]No more options?
[252:58.98]No, we can backtrack and find the things we missed the first time around.
[253:02.00]What?
[253:02.18]Well, we don't have time to go through this entire ship again.
[253:05.16]Get close to that sun, remember?
[253:08.64]I don't want to do that.
[253:12.81]Might as well face it, Eri.
[253:13.89]This floating mausoleum has taken a plunge.
[253:15.97]And we're going along for the ride.
[253:18.19]I know.
[253:18.51]I'm not doing it.
[253:19.09]You can't give up without a fight, Zack.
[253:24.09]You know what your problem is, Eric?
[253:25.65]You've never known when the fight is over.
[253:38.78]Why are they giving up?
[253:40.18]You're actually agreeing with me for once?
[253:56.84]What?
[253:59.44]No, yes.
[254:00.54]No, yes.
[254:01.06]They have really squeaky clothes.
[254:09.40]Have you figured that out?
[254:13.47]What?
[254:25.61]Uh, okay, wait.
[254:26.49]Yellow, blue, yellow, red.
[254:33.52]Where am I supposed to go?
[254:38.92]Red.
[254:42.18]Green.
[254:49.03]Red.
[254:49.27]Alright, we're gonna go to red.
[254:52.77]Red.
[254:56.68]Scan that.
[254:57.12]Alright, I have red.
[255:12.87]Alien patterned chroma symbols.
[255:18.06]Why is it not over?
[255:18.82]I think it is.
[255:24.67]Oh, thank God I scanned this fucking door.
[255:26.49]That would have been horrible if I didn't.
[255:29.33]Alright, um... What are you doing?
[255:38.97]This is... We're at the end.
[255:39.93]This is disk four, man.
[255:41.41]I warn you, Jeremy.
[255:42.15]Beat this game and one billion's added to the debt.
[255:43.91]I don't agree to that.
[255:49.01]I don't agree with that.
[255:49.95]What are you talking about?
[255:52.46]Why is it telling me to insert disk two?
[256:00.42]What?
[256:00.58]What do you mean disk two?
[256:02.33]I don't understand.
[256:10.69]Why do I have to... This game's not 40 hours long.
[256:16.53]We're on the final disk.
[256:21.73]Wait, this says you can skip the red door if you already have the orb from the crew quarters.
[256:29.45]Did I get the orb from the crew quarters?
[256:36.89]I got a orb.
[256:37.75]Fuck if I know.
[256:44.38]No.
[256:48.64]What the hell is this?
[256:51.86]I never went in here.
[256:55.88]Oh, I'm really good at these.
[256:56.82]I'm really good at these.
[256:57.54]I'll do fine.
[257:00.29]I already know what it wants me to do.
[257:02.87]This is a little bit harder than I thought it was going to be, but it's alright.
[257:34.30]Alright, I have to make everything... Come on.
[257:41.45]I got it.
[257:43.97]What is it?
[257:50.97]What does it want me to do?
[257:55.90]Oh, this actually is the final... Guys, this is the final puzzle of the game.
[258:06.52]Wait, what the fuck?
[258:07.68]I have to do that?
[258:08.40]I have to do this?
[258:24.16]Holy... It's yours, top right, no shit.
[258:27.87]Hey, hey, easy!
[258:39.77]Hold on.
[258:40.19]I'm almost.
[258:48.04]It's close.
[258:52.00]Can I fuck it up?
[258:57.73]Hold on.
[258:58.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[259:05.81]Oh.
[259:07.48]I did it.
[259:08.04]Come on.
[259:21.59]No!
[259:22.51]I- And then... Fuck.
[259:38.60]It's the final puzzle of the game.
[259:40.06]I got it.
[259:52.21]How do you got shit on me?
[259:54.25]None of you got shit on me.
[259:56.43]None of you got shit on me.
[259:58.65]Ain't nobody got shit on me.
[260:00.85]Ain't nobody got shit on me.
[260:09.70]Uh,
[260:23.37]Congrats, you beat it on easy.
[260:26.38]Who cares?
[260:29.42]Eat the bug.
[260:29.94]I don't think I can eat the bug.
[260:47.29]Uh, what am I supposed to be doing?
[260:53.53]Bug.
[260:55.35]Wait.
[260:56.03]No, I was already in here.
[260:57.73]What happened?
[260:58.09]Did I get an orb?
[261:00.47]Did I get an orb?
[261:03.15]I don't remember getting an orb in here.
[261:16.40]Snap the disk.
[261:17.91]No, there's no... Does anybody remember if I got an orb in here?
[261:27.23]Can I tell if I have one?
[261:29.15]How many do I have?
[261:33.25]I don't have that info.
[261:38.06]Is an orb an egg?
[261:41.56]I'm so fucking close.
[261:42.92]I have to end this.
[261:44.18]I'm so close.
[261:51.11]It's something in this room.
[261:54.69]Is this the room where you paid no attention?
[261:58.45]Absolutely.
[261:58.93]Is this open?
[262:09.98]Alright, this one doesn't open.
[262:15.80]Does this one open?
[262:19.59]The whole game you mean?
[262:20.61]Have I been in here?
[262:25.85]I don't think I've been in here.
[262:33.78]Is it an orb?
[262:35.86]I can't select it.
[262:37.40]Orb, orb, orb.
[262:38.58]I can't get it.
[262:44.63]No, I can't get anything in here.
[262:45.71]Is there an orb in here?
[262:56.72]I don't see... There's not one in there.
[263:00.38]That's what happens when poop wine gets in your veins.
[263:02.99]You didn't even say that.
[263:04.05]I just said that for you.
[263:11.14]Do I already have the thing?
[263:13.30]You can skip the red door if you already have the orb from the crew quarters.
[263:16.18]But you're assuming... Walkthrough is assuming that I paid attention to anything that happened like four hours ago.
[263:36.09]I have this sneaking suspicion he's nowhere near the end.
[263:37.97]No, this is the finale.
[263:43.98]What they said is backtrack.
[263:46.36]You added a backtrack section to the finale.
[263:49.21]You assholes.
[264:03.35]okay this says go to the crew quarters kill the alien and get the orb uh this what is that I don't see an alien didn't this alien die already did we pull an orb out of this alien
[264:35.22]It was like, oh, there was something glowing.
[264:37.02]We pulled an orb out of the alien's head!
[264:38.82]Remember the alien that came down and died?
[264:42.45]And the thing was glowing on his head?
[264:43.97]Didn't we pull it out of him?
[264:46.11]We pulled an orb out of his head, didn't we?
[264:47.83]I don't remember.
[264:48.53]It felt like it was like two weeks ago.
[264:52.53]No, you did not do that.
[264:56.71]Well, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[265:03.25]It glowed, but I didn't interact with it.
[265:06.64]This is obviously the crew quarters.
[265:08.72]That's obviously an orb up there.
[265:29.63]Here we go.
[265:30.01]Here we go.
[265:34.97]Let's go.
[265:38.77]I have to look in each one of these holes.
[265:42.45]No way.
[265:55.79]I see something in there.
[265:56.85]No, no, I don't want to.
[266:08.97]No!
[266:09.89]I have to look at all the holes.
[266:17.64]I'm gonna get jump scared.
[266:18.66]Turn on the light?
[266:31.07]I can't.
[266:35.77]Just be ready to kill the bug.
[266:37.35]I'm ready.
[266:39.14]I'm gonna laser this fucking thing.
[266:41.53]The second it shows up.
[266:51.69]Oh, Jesus.
[266:55.81]I'm gonna absolutely laser the fuck out of this thing.
[267:13.62]I try to think of the logic when you make a game like this, right?
[267:16.34]Like, okay, let's have, like, 40 holes that you look in, and each hole takes, like, six or seven seconds to look in.
[267:26.15]I try to imagine the functionality here.
[267:44.62]Is it in?
[267:45.54]Is it in?
[267:46.24]Turn the light on?
[267:48.96]I don't, I have no light.
[267:53.38]You have to activate night vision.
[267:55.40]There's nothing in the holes.
[267:57.02]What?
[268:00.14]Bullshit.
[268:00.66]Why would they have you do this?
[268:12.91]Top row, top row, top row.
[268:16.79]Top row?
[268:27.09]You're doing it, please.
[268:27.83]You need to check all the holes twice.
[268:36.30]No, you don't.
[268:43.90]I...
[268:47.98]The best part about this is the walkthrough just says, go to the crew quarters, kill the alien, get the orb.
[268:53.61]They didn't... They left out the part where you have to look in a hundred holes.
[268:56.17]Is there another walkthrough?
[269:06.79]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[269:08.13]Enter through the partially open door into the crew quarters and cross over to the far side.
[269:11.21]Come back to the door side.
[269:12.80]Swing right to the second column of triads.
[269:15.08]Click on the lower triad, then the upper right hole.
[269:18.30]Can you say- can you say that to me, like, in English?
[269:21.98]Like, come back to the door side, swing right to the second column of triads, click on the lower triad, then upper- I can't- I, like, I can't understand what that's saying.
[269:33.16]Partially open door- Come back to the door side, swing right to the second column of triads, click on the lower- What?
[269:43.52]What?
[269:46.46]Wait, go back towards the door.
[269:47.82]Okay, swing right.
[270:00.39]Second column.
[270:02.23]Lower ones.
[270:03.75]Top right.
[270:25.99]I can't believe this is in the game.
[270:28.56]I can't... I can't believe it.
[270:47.77]Is this the guy that actively tortures his viewers?
[270:49.53]Yes, because I want... This should be a lesson in... Alright, those of you guys that are teaching game design in college or whatever, some of you professors here, download... Just get this whole game, and then make your class play it.
[271:00.07]And say, don't fucking do that.
[271:02.67]Don't do this.
[271:03.92]Ever.
[271:09.76]This is educational purposes at this point.
[271:17.73]Professor, Professor Elbertson, why did you make us do this?
[271:20.41]We had to look through all these holes.
[271:22.17]Yeah, sucked, didn't it?
[271:24.43]Yeah, it was horrible.
[271:25.31]And like the part of the game we had to like scan the wall and stuff.
[271:30.92]Yeah, that part was bad too, wasn't it?
[271:33.58]Why did you make us do that?
[271:35.37]And then I take my glasses off and I put my fucking feet on the desk.
[271:41.81]Why don't you tell me?
[271:44.51]You be the teacher.
[271:46.49]And I have the teacher of the student company.
[271:48.11]No, not bare feet.
[271:51.98]Alright, where?
[271:55.56]I'm getting tortured too, you know that, right?
[271:57.34]But I have to finish it.
[272:00.12]This is one of those torture streams where I torture the fuck out of myself.
[272:03.43]For educational purposes only.
[272:09.32]I missed one.
[272:10.58]Okay, this is towards the door.
[272:12.18]Swing right.
[272:13.46]Spam that coffee pasta again, please.
[272:17.04]Watch the speedrun.
[272:24.29]It was fake.
[272:32.27]Back to the channel that's speedrunning it.
[272:36.01]Okay, let's see.
[272:40.24]He comes in.
[272:46.77]Torture.
[272:49.57]This is the definition of sunk cost fallacy.
[272:53.69]Yeah, but eventually.
[272:54.37]Okay, so you go towards the back.
[272:59.20]And then you bang a right.
[273:01.58]It's almost over and I can't wait for it to be over.
[273:03.66]And by the way, we're not done.
[273:04.72]Like, I'm not done streaming after this.

[273:34.68]Okay, attack it.
[273:35.72]That was really scary.
[273:39.47]Shoot him.

[275:51.14]No, wrong.
[275:52.04]That was wrong.
[276:01.76]That's so stupid.
[276:03.28]Why did that take my favorite thing of the day?
[276:08.06]Just around one of these corridors.

[277:34.84]Wait, don't I already have this?
[277:35.68]I already have the yellow door.
[277:42.17]Yeah, I already have this door.
[277:44.93]I did the puzzle already.
[277:46.77]Yeah, this shit just opens, man.
[277:53.68]This, this says... Go through the, to go through the next door.
[278:00.36]And then turn left.
[278:14.64]Okay, go through this door.
[278:22.34]And there's apparently an orb in here.
[278:33.23]And then just to the left of this door, there is an orb dispenser.
[278:38.03]What?
[278:42.07]Wait.
[278:44.57]Right here?
[278:55.08]The other left.
[278:59.00]Oh, hi.
[279:01.97]Wait, what?
[279:10.85]Uh.
[279:12.99]Is this right?
[279:15.75]Can't really interact with anything.
[279:21.27]Even with the guide.
[279:22.17]Yeah, because it's like, go... Okay, I'm going to read this to you out loud.
[279:25.83]Click yellow to open it.
[279:26.81]Go through the next door.
[279:27.85]Turn left.
[279:28.33]Go through the door and turn around.
[279:29.76]Just to the left of the door.
[279:36.92]I was right.
[279:37.52]Okay, then it says, send it yellow.
[279:44.48]Ugh.
[279:48.60]Grab it.
[280:04.50]Nice.
[280:05.36]Orb number three.
[280:08.32]Pick it up.
[280:11.80]Everybody just put your hands up.
[280:12.90]Everybody just stand up.
[280:14.57]Everybody put your hands up.
[280:16.41]Everybody just stand up.
[280:18.19]Everybody put your hands up.
[280:24.85]Everybody just stand up.
[280:27.59]Everybody just stand up.
[280:30.82]Everybody, everybody, just put your hands up.

[280:42.40]Everybody put your hands up.
[280:44.06]Everybody just stand up.
[280:46.36]Everybody put your hands up.
[280:48.94]Everybody just stand up.
[280:52.00]Alright, now we go back to the hub and we have all three orbs and then we can finally end this fucking game.
[280:58.83]I don't even know which one of these doors goes back to the hub.
[281:00.83]We're going to click on random ones as if we find the way back to the hub.
[281:03.09]I have no idea.
[281:03.93]Jeremiah, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying.
[281:06.73]Well, what happened?
[281:11.39]I'm not gonna... That's like a sexual thing.
[281:13.33]I'm not gonna put that on stream.
[281:16.25]This is not the right way, is it?
[281:18.05]No.
[281:21.63]I'm lost.
[281:23.91]Wait!
[281:24.81]No, I'm lost.
[281:25.43]How do I go?
[281:26.25]How do I get out of here?
[281:35.91]I don't know.
[281:36.51]I'm actually lost.
[281:39.28]You can sit down here.
[281:43.39]This is the wrong way.
[281:44.55]Yeah.
[281:46.41]Backtrack.
[281:48.23]Absolute bullshit.
[281:52.23]If I fall off here and die, I swear I'm gonna be so upset.
[281:58.94]What the fuck are we doing here?
[282:00.34]What is this?
[282:01.56]This is... How did I get here?
[282:03.82]Why am I here?
[282:08.80]Go back.
[282:09.76]Get me the hell out of there.
[282:15.09]I'm rage finishing the game.
[282:18.07]This is a case study.
[282:19.09]This is an educational stream.
[282:24.77]For some reason, they decided to put us upside down.
[282:43.03]Actually, I like this one.
[282:47.13]You can't add any debt unless I agree to it.
[282:58.06]I have to agree to it.
[283:04.20]Is there even a door here?
[283:08.86]Isn't this the way that I just came?
[283:12.10]Where...
[283:16.96]Go to go that go to that blurry direction Wait this is not You see the link yet is that it this is the wrong way again It's just unclear fucking anything Just reload the last chapter from the menu I hope this works I
[283:47.97]Wait, is this going to work?
[283:49.47]Is this actually going to work?
[283:50.63]I don't know, man.
[283:52.55]Should I not have done that?
[283:53.57]I don't know if I should have done that.
[283:59.61]Oh my god, should I not have done that?
[284:02.28]Oh my god.
[284:03.68]Oh my god, what did I do?
[284:06.40]What have I done?
[284:07.04]What the fuck did I do?
[284:10.24]Please don't tell me I fucked this whole thing up.
[284:13.84]I'm telling you right now, I'm not going back and doing this shit again.
[284:17.03]I would rather eat my own hand.
[284:18.33]I'd rather you cut my fucking hand off and put it in the oven and cook it at like 350 for two hours and I eat it on stream.
[284:24.59]I'd rather do that than go back and do the like last 45 minutes.
[284:31.53]I know I said I'd rather shit my pants.
[284:33.13]Like shit all over me instead of going back and feed it.
[284:35.73]I'd rather eat myself.
[284:36.67]I'd rather fucking poo on myself.
[284:38.01]Right, I've said this like three times.
[284:44.85]Do I have the orbs?
[284:47.62]Please tell me I have them.
[284:48.90]I don't want to go back.
[284:50.20]I don't want to go back.
[284:51.10]I can't go back.
[284:52.89]I can't go back.
[284:53.41]Is there a way for me to check?
[284:56.53]Oh my, please, God.
[284:57.77]I hope I don't have to go back.
[284:58.91]I hope I don't have to.
[285:03.19]If I... I please... I have all the orbs, right?
[285:09.02]I got them all and I just went... I just did different scenes.
[285:11.10]Oh my God.
[285:15.18]Please tell me I have them again.
[285:18.77]Don't have me do this again.
[285:20.49]It's definitely saved.
[285:21.41]It definitely keeps it stored in the cache.
[285:23.39]I know it does.
[285:28.78]Stored in the cache.
[285:30.46]Because the other ones were stored and we jumped around to different sections of the game.
[285:34.36]It's ready.
[285:34.98]It's here.
[285:36.17]Here comes the three orbs.
[285:37.37]We have them.
[285:38.01]Oh, wow.
[285:38.39]You found them.
[285:39.71]Wow, you got all the orbs.
[285:40.53]Put the orbs in here.
[285:42.17]You did a great job, Casey.
[285:43.59]Excellent work.
[285:46.02]We all love you and you're all very, you're very smart.
[285:49.87]Here we go.
[285:50.95]Did it.
[285:52.61]And here are your three orbs.
[285:55.21]Here are the orbs.
[285:57.00]Hey, Casey.
[285:57.90]Hey.
[285:58.68]No luck out there, huh?
[286:00.00]I appreciate you trying anyway.
[286:15.52]No, it's not even... No, why?
[286:21.67]Why, why, why, why, why?
[286:28.77]Why?
[286:34.66]I know, I know where they all are.
[286:36.22]I'm gonna eat my fucking hand.
[286:39.10]Add this to worst meltdown of the year.
[286:40.66]I don't even care.
[286:42.36]I have to, I'm gonna eat my fucking hand, put it in the oven.
[286:50.19]Open this fucking door right now.
[286:52.78]I know where they all are.
[286:53.70]I know where they are.
[286:54.40]You're building the guillotine?
[286:58.94]I'll put my head in that thing.
[287:06.94]Open the fucking door.
[287:08.60]What are you doing?
[287:09.46]What?
[287:14.02]Oh.
[287:17.66]Damn it, man.
[287:18.49]This game probably cost like 30 million dollars.
[287:23.62]To make.
[287:40.73]Crack each disk in half when you're done.
[287:43.34]I don't even know why I listened.
[287:44.72]Somebody said, hey, skip.
[287:45.56]But it was in perfect reason, though.
[287:47.40]It was a very reasonable thing to say.
[287:51.00]Like, go to the menu and skip all this.
[287:52.62]And you were right.
[287:53.80]You were so right.
[287:54.67]That made perfect sense.
[288:03.39]You're a monster.
[288:05.66]I know.
[288:07.04]That's okay.
[288:07.50]I'll wear that.
[288:08.28]I'll wear that today.
[288:09.44]But we're like one cutscene away from beating this game.
[288:12.20]And I cannot... I can't get to the end of this shit and then give the fuck up.
[288:18.84]This is perseverance.
[288:22.72]I know exactly where it is.
[288:23.89]Just get it.
[288:24.51]I know where the other one is.
[288:25.31]Just get it.
[288:25.73]And then just keep track of where you are.
[288:27.01]Okay.
[288:29.15]I bet it's left.
[288:30.61]Not that way.
[288:35.26]Okay, so when I come out, I take a left and leave.
[288:37.99]Done.
[288:38.58]Shoot the alien in the head.
[288:51.85]This game sucks, though.
[288:53.02]What the hell?
[288:54.10]I know, I know.
[288:55.28]And I knew it.
[288:55.88]Okay, after hour number two, I knew it sucked.
[288:59.58]But it kept me here.
[289:02.26]It's forcing me to beat it.
[289:04.32]With, like, radiation rays.
[289:06.37]I don't know what this thing's emitting, but it's making me want to do it.
[289:16.76]See, look at how much faster this was this time.
[289:18.16]We're good.
[289:21.55]Done.
[289:22.33]I already got one.
[289:26.63]Why is he dead?
[289:29.08]What?
[289:29.22]What are you talking about?
[289:32.00]So I have, wait, I have this one.
[289:34.56]I have this, I have it.
[289:37.26]Why do I?
[289:48.14]What?
[289:52.28]You need to go yellow instead, but hold on.
[289:54.47]I didn't turn... I'm not soft-locked.
[290:11.35]Where's the exit over here?
[290:12.61]I don't know.
[290:16.04]Default return scene.
[290:18.64]No, no.
[290:19.20]It's because the yellow one I didn't turn it in.
[290:20.98]It remembers that I turned in this one.
[290:25.64]I didn't give the yellow one yet.
[290:27.34]That's true.
[290:28.00]Okay.
[290:28.48]Alright.
[290:28.76]Makes sense.
[290:30.26]Now I have to change fucking discs again.
[290:34.92]There is no god.
[290:35.84]I know this now.
[290:36.70]This is the evidence of it.
[290:42.01]Imagine if you're one of the game developers and you happen to stumble upon this stream.
[290:45.45]And this guy watching it and seeing how much everyone hates this.
[290:48.84]And then you hear somebody, you read somebody in the chat that says, there is no god because of this game in this stream.
[290:56.54]Like, you gotta click the X and just, like, kind of go, like, take a shower.
[291:00.18]Like, you can't... Oh, somebody's playing the Dallas Encounter.
[291:06.31]I, like, was a game designer on that.
[291:08.67]There is no god because of this game.
[291:11.80]Oh, what the fuck?
[291:15.33]Holy shit, settle down.
[291:18.17]What's wrong with you guys?
[291:22.03]You don't understand, we were working on computers that had like 56K modems.
[291:29.29]And loading up one of these FMVs into our program took three days.
[291:36.16]Fuck all of you assholes.
[291:37.82]How dare you?
[291:38.86]This game was like gold back 30 years ago.
[291:41.92]We're going to let this asshole talk shit about it?
[291:44.04]I mean, they're right.
[291:55.84]You know, they're right.
[291:56.54]They are.
[292:03.58]Open the fucking door.
[292:11.43]Open the door.
[292:13.33]Alright, let's get it.
[292:15.67]Let's get it.
[292:16.59]Let's get it.
[292:17.77]Let's get it.
[292:18.71]Let's get it.
[292:24.71]Let's get it.
[292:26.52]Bang a left.
[292:29.96]The orb.
[292:30.32]Alright, bang a left.
[292:33.66]And when we come up, we're banging a right.
[292:35.36]Remember that.
[292:43.00]Let's get lost, Omega Loaf.
[292:54.17]There it is.
[292:55.55]Excuse me.
[292:56.37]Give me that orb.
[292:57.31]I'll take it.
[293:07.48]Putus.
[293:10.80]Grab that shit.
[293:16.99]There's no skipping cutscenes.
[293:20.02]I wish I could.
[293:22.94]Head up.
[293:23.44]Alright.
[293:24.12]Out of here.
[293:24.48]Bang a right.
[293:25.20]Straight through that door.
[293:26.20]Get me the fuck out of here.
[293:27.50]End the game.
[293:28.57]End it.
[293:33.03]You're aging your chat by playing this.
[293:35.25]Look, it's only been like... Okay.
[293:38.67]I have probably like 6,000 hours on stream.
[293:43.65]four or five of these are Daedalus Encounter.
[293:46.11]That's like 0.0001% of all the streams I've done.
[293:49.87]So that means that 99.99999% of all streams were fucking incredible games.
[293:56.76]Well, besides half of them that were not very good.
[293:59.48]So I'd say like 49.999% are very good games, right?
[294:12.28]He keeps playing trash games over and over again.
[294:16.39]But they're the most charming.
[294:17.71]Except for this one.
[294:23.01]Fuck this.
[294:23.37]I'm going to stream.
[294:23.99]I'm doing a spite stream.
[294:25.23]Alright, whatever.
[294:26.51]Fine.
[294:26.77]You can upload pictures of me.
[294:29.50]Talk shit to me on your stream.
[294:30.96]You're going to do a shit talking stream?
[294:36.64]I'm just going to restream my stream and then talk a bunch of shit about me.
[294:44.41]Yo, you're gonna be in big trouble if you do that one.
[294:46.57]Alright, now what?
[294:57.31]What?
[294:58.15]That's all the orbs.
[295:02.45]Go to the orange door.
[295:16.43]This one.
[295:18.57]He didn't know.
[295:19.11]Hold on.
[295:27.73]What does this say?
[295:33.81]What does this say?
[295:36.87]New offer.
[295:37.61]Please stop.
[295:39.99]Oh my fucking god.
[295:40.71]Please stop.
[295:41.59]Stop.
[295:41.89]Make it stop.
[295:42.37]Ugh.
[295:48.48]Why do I look like that?
[295:49.46]What's wrong with my eyes?
[295:50.10]Alright, let's go.
[295:53.80]This is the final door.
[295:56.10]I know it.
[295:56.58]This is the last door.
[295:57.44]I know it for a fact.
[296:07.95]Disk 3.
[296:11.03]You end the game on Disk 3?
[296:12.36]That's kind of weird.
[296:17.54]I bet an hour ago.
[296:19.62]I'm just going by what the... Where in the finale?
[296:37.88]The finale was two hours ago.
[296:39.34]Yeah, it's a long finale.
[296:45.38]Orange door.
[296:47.30]Going to the medical center.
[296:49.42]Wait, isn't this the... Haven't we already been down here?
[296:52.82]I think I was so excited for this stream.
[297:10.81]Came a whole hour early for this.
[297:17.69]Alright, well, you know, I... Oh, we've got something over here.
[297:34.32]Uh-oh.
[297:37.44]Something over here.
[297:39.02]What is this?
[297:58.07]I didn't... I didn't scan the orange door.
[298:23.71]There's only, like, five sentences left in the walkthrough, guys.
[298:27.59]Don't worry.
[298:28.76]We're gonna get through this together.
[298:30.54]We're gonna get through this.
[298:41.74]I know, I'm, like, talking like this is a zombie apocalypse right now.
[298:44.34]We're gonna get through this.
[298:45.03]Just stay together.
[298:48.79]Oh, fuck you.
[298:49.95]Oh.
[298:59.34]Please end the game.
[298:59.96]I'm going as fast as I can.
[299:01.34]I'm going as fast as I can.
[299:16.92]Nevada stream.
[299:18.06]I'm going faster than that.
[299:27.34]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[299:28.86]Okay.
[299:34.84]Why don't you get up and help?
[299:39.88]Why don't you get up and help me?
[299:47.30]Scan the door.
[299:50.41]I can't believe I have to scan another door.
[299:52.25]How did I not get this scanned?
[300:11.36]7,000 people were tortured today in a freak streaming accident.
[300:15.89]How would it be a freak streaming accident if I'm deliberately torturing you?
[300:23.92]There it is.
[300:24.58]Okay.
[300:25.14]Go on in.
[300:34.66]Oh, a freak streaming accident where a guy tortured 7,000 people for five hours.
[300:43.09]No, I didn't like leave the stove on.
[301:01.63]You're the Joker.
[301:05.73]I'm not the Joker.
[301:08.99]I'm the Riddler.
[301:19.47]Now, anybody that says they're the Riddler is actually the Joker.
[301:23.31]Anybody that says they're the Joker is actually the Penguin.
[301:48.58]Is that a recycled joke?
[301:50.50]Well, maybe.
[301:53.74]Okay.
[301:54.30]Wait.
[301:54.66]What's this?
[301:54.94]Can I touch anything else in here before I end?
[301:57.98]You know, we're in the last two sentences of the game.
[302:02.34]You know what I mean, guys?
[302:03.38]You know what I mean?
[302:09.58]I actually played Penguin in the show Gotham.
[302:12.78]You're a pretty talented actor.
[302:14.50]He's actually pretty good.
[302:24.72]What's that actor's name?
[302:25.40]That actor's actually really good.
[302:32.68]Orb number four.
[302:34.52]Done.
[302:35.66]Got it.
[302:35.92]Okay.
[302:45.38]I have all the orbs.
[302:48.09]But...
[302:54.91]Um, now what?
[302:58.17]Return?
[303:06.24]Go back with the orb.
[303:09.02]You're fucked, dude.
[303:09.80]Four out of ten.
[303:11.24]You need six.
[303:12.36]What do you mean six?
[303:13.02]There's not six orbs.
[303:23.19]There are six doors, therefore there are six orbs.
[303:26.33]No, no, no, no.
[303:27.35]That's not accurate.
[303:30.57]That's not accurate.
[303:39.28]It's not true.
[303:40.50]I have the guide right in front of me.
[303:41.80]The guide is right here.
[304:02.31]Trust the guide.
[304:03.19]Pepe left.
[304:06.68]Why wouldn't I?
[304:07.20]First stage.
[304:17.02]I thought you said first disk of grief.
[304:19.97]Which would have been much funnier.
[304:30.32]Another one.
[304:30.56]This is just you guys.
[304:31.30]The five discs of grief.
[304:34.90]Wait, what do you mean?
[304:53.39]No, I don't, I don't, there's no more discs.
[304:55.91]What do you mean I have to get, I don't know where they are.
[304:57.48]The guy didn't say to get these, these spheres.
[305:03.00]The guy did not say to get the spheres.
[305:09.38]Where is these other spheres?
[305:20.41]What?
[305:36.61]Uh... It ain't worth it.
[305:41.17]It's been five hours.
[305:42.30]Uh... six orbs?
[305:49.20]Who is this for?
[305:49.90]You hate playing and we hate watching.
[305:55.62]Who is this for?
[305:57.08]It's not for me and it's not for you!
[305:59.80]So who is this for?
[306:02.36]I don't know who this is for.
[306:04.20]I can't even tell you.
[306:05.44]I wish I could say it's for me.
[306:06.92]It's not.
[306:09.20]What's this for?
[306:11.14]It's just to complete it.
[306:16.06]It's just playing itself.
[306:22.10]Turn it off.
[306:22.87]Stop then.
[306:24.13]But I've spent so much time in here.
[306:28.49]But there's so much time in here.
[306:31.20]But wait, let me just see how quickly this could be done.
[306:33.32]I'm already at four out of six stones.
[306:37.31]Stones.
[306:44.83]Guys, my GoXLR is broken.
[306:48.35]I can't even mess with any of the settings.
[306:53.25]Does it sound like this the whole time?
[307:03.06]Where are the last two cubes?
[307:05.20]There are five orbs.
[307:06.36]Alright, there's only five.
[307:07.12]Where's the last one?
[307:09.80]Where's that last one?
[307:12.04]Blue hall.
[307:13.38]Where's that last one, guys?
[307:18.95]There are not seven orbs.
[307:19.73]There's five.
[307:24.69]Blue hall.
[307:25.17]Hold on.
[307:25.45]Okay.
[307:29.58]Okay.
[307:32.45]When facing the statue, click blue and see the orbit.
[307:37.62]Okay.
[307:37.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[307:39.18]Here we go.
[307:39.46]Go.
[307:39.58]Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
[307:40.42]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[307:41.94]This is green, but fuck.
[307:42.96]It's okay.
[307:43.66]Go back.
[307:55.39]We gotta go through the blue door.
[307:57.52]I got the- I know where the blue one is.
[308:02.73]Blue door.
[308:04.13]Let's go.
[308:06.81]I saw the blue orb up top.
[308:08.69]I already have the blue door scanned.
[308:13.87]I got it.
[308:14.15]Okay.
[308:15.13]So, we go through here.
[308:16.25]Just go in.
[308:25.04]No.
[308:25.34]I'm trying to hit blue.
[308:26.76]Just three.
[308:27.14]You got it.
[308:27.50]Quick.
[308:29.68]Now I know exactly what I'm doing.
[308:32.46]There's so many fingerprints on the bottom of that disk, I don't even care.
[308:39.02]Okay.
[308:41.68]So when we're facing the statue, click blue and see the orbit puzzle.
[308:48.93]There's a statue in this room.
[309:01.24]Look for that statue.
[309:04.24]And the orb is in the statue.
[309:09.32]This is very- this is a huge room.
[309:24.91]The orb is inside of Casey.
[309:28.15]Well, you just fucking ruined the game.
[309:33.65]Okay.
[309:34.41]There's an orb inside of this.
[309:36.58]Here we go.
[309:37.40]Use blue.
[309:39.46]Blue.
[309:48.65]Uh, how do I... Use blue.
[309:53.35]Trying to use blue.
[310:08.12]When facing the statue, click blue and see the orbit puzzle.
[310:23.02]Oh shit.
[310:23.36]Alright, here we go.
[310:32.99]Now what?
[310:41.20]Uh.
[310:42.44]What?
[310:42.60]What did I just do?
[310:46.82]Uh, okay.
[311:01.51]Four of the planets are directly movable.
[311:03.43]Call them A, B, C, and D. Okay.
[311:07.59]Okay.
[311:11.57]Four of the planets are movable.
[311:12.53]They're ordered in the bottom right selection window.
[311:15.63]You must move the fifth planet over the sun.
[311:26.15]Move A to 11 o'clock.
[311:31.31]Which one is A?
[311:33.69]Move A to... Wait, analog.
[311:35.15]Move A to 11 o'clock.
[311:36.27]I need the analog clock.
[311:40.89]Uh, hold on.
[311:43.81]Move A to 11 o'clock.
[311:47.05]I don't even understand what the fuck you're talking about.
[311:49.39]Am I moving the planet right now?
[311:54.31]Okay, well here's like 11.
[312:05.89]I can't like directly touch them.
[312:08.25]Okay, so this is... This one's here.
[312:15.29]A at 11 o'clock.
[312:16.89]B at... C to 430.
[312:23.64]C to... 12.
[312:23.90]1.
[312:23.92]2.
[312:23.94]3.
[312:23.96]430.
[312:24.04]What the fuck are you talking about?
[312:46.79]Put it at 120.
[312:47.17]What?
[312:47.39]I don't even, like, understand what... Where's this fifth planet?
[313:07.94]Look at the bottom left.
[313:09.03]Okay, but this... Am I... How... I don't even know what I'm looking at here.
[313:18.70]This is the planet in the middle.
[313:21.64]But I'm not moving this planet.
[313:26.12]How do I move the actual planets instead of just... Why does it say put A to like 1130?
[313:34.53]Like what is it even talking about?
[313:37.59]Drag it?
[313:38.13]Oh my fucking Jesus.
[313:43.34]What the hell is this?
[313:52.06]Okay, put A to 11.
[313:53.16]Alright, A at 11.
[313:55.87]C, 430.
[313:58.83]C, that's like kind of 430, right?
[314:06.85]D to 120. 120.
[314:24.77]Where is it?
[314:27.59]That's kind of 120?
[314:29.63]It's like 11, right?
[314:40.54]Up here?
[314:45.30]Now what?
[314:49.20]Move to face the statue and click send.
[314:52.83]That's four.
[314:53.97]What?
[314:55.37]Isn't this the one I'm moving up here?
[315:05.12]No.
[315:07.72]What?
[315:14.42]Look at the yellow dot.
[315:20.40]What planet am I actually trying to get to?
[315:22.25]This is too fucking much.
[315:26.75]This is just bizarrely set up.
[315:34.51]It says put this to 11 o'clock.
[315:37.59]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[315:49.11]Wait like this like put that there Let's see 430 Wasn't I I was already doing that alright.
[316:02.82]This is like 430 The 120 it's already there oh
[316:18.61]This is C. C is at 120.
[316:23.11]A at 11.
[316:23.79]C at 430.
[316:24.53]D at 120.
[316:41.05]I'm too drunk for this.
[316:42.03]I feel like a microwave.
[316:44.29]Then send it!
[316:45.87]Well, no, this has to be... doesn't this have to be over the... Is this right?
[316:53.04]It doesn't say anything about B. Solution.
[316:55.80]Move A to 11, C to 430, D to 120.
[316:58.20]You might need some minor adjustments, but you do not have to move C at all.
[317:03.01]What?! !
[317:08.75]B is, it's wrong.
[317:10.69]It's a typo.
[317:11.27]C to 430.
[317:11.53]B to 430.
[317:13.49]C, you don't have to move C at all.
[317:20.94]So where was C in the beginning?
[317:32.32]It literally says, solution, move A to 11, C to 430, D to 120.
[317:34.92]You don't have to move C at all.
[317:48.06]The image is fucking awesome.
[317:50.27]They meant B at the end.
[317:51.65]Well, how... A to 11.
[317:55.15]A to 11.
[317:56.41]C to 430.
[317:56.97]D to 120. 120.
[318:17.72]It's there already.
[318:19.20]So you don't have to move B at all.
[318:22.87]Is that it?
[318:31.03]Alright, send it.
[318:32.41]Oh, it's wrong.
[318:41.32]B was good.
[318:42.04]So the guide was wrong.
[318:44.78]Make minor adjustments.
[319:08.35]That's not 120.
[319:10.98]12... This is 120 right here.
[319:16.84]By the way, there is no minute hand, so what are you talking about?
[319:24.16]He's been looking at the wrong guide.
[319:27.49]Give me another guide.
[319:28.65]This one's fucking wrong.
[319:35.71]There's no minute hand.
[319:37.17]Omega lost Stackem's brain.
[319:41.98]Somebody just had it.
[319:47.40]Planet 1, 430.
[319:48.60]Planet 2, 3.
[319:49.50]Planet 3, 3.
[319:50.72]Planet 4, 330.
[319:52.11]That's completely inaccurate from the guide that I'm looking at right now.
[320:08.73]I think you might have a case of a CD.
[320:11.09]Remember, chat left an hour ago.
[320:14.96]You're talking to nobody.
[320:15.88]This is on easy.
[320:18.10]Reset the puzzle?
[320:19.02]Hold on.
[320:19.34]Did that reset?
[320:28.65]What is this?
[320:31.81]I don't think I can even reset.
[320:32.89]I don't think I can reset this.
[320:35.19]I literally can't reset it.
[320:41.83]I have to turn the console off or restart the chapter.
[320:44.62]I'm not doing that.
[320:46.16]I'm gonna do it for him.
[320:51.90]Read this.
[320:52.38]It's a paste bin.
[320:53.16]I don't know what the fuck that is.
[321:00.23]Why does this have to suck?
[321:02.51]I can't stop!
[321:10.64]All the guides were written like 25 years ago, so of course they're gonna be fucking inaccurate and messed up.
[321:23.65]There's only one walkthrough of this game that exists on GameFAQs, and there's one person on PC.
[321:41.59]Alright, where's that guy?
[321:43.23]Give me that guy again.
[321:44.05]There we go.
[321:44.51]Let's go.
[321:45.11]Let's go.
[321:45.53]Here it is.
[321:47.61]What does he got?
[321:48.41]What does he got?
[321:48.83]Let's see how fucking wrong this was.
[321:51.02]Okay, one is completely wrong, by the way.
[321:57.06]So A is down here.
[322:08.04]C is... FUCK!
[322:10.62]It's too much to look at!
[322:12.80]Okay, A is actually right here.
[322:17.12]A is literally right here.
[322:18.53]It was completely fucking wrong.
[322:21.63]B... is also right there.
[322:28.15]The guide was 1000% wrong.
[322:29.37]C...
[322:38.89]It's down at around 6 o'clock.
[322:48.39]Where's D?
[322:50.27]D is top left.
[322:51.63]D. There it is.
[323:27.61]Does that count?
[323:41.53]This counts, right?
[323:42.45]I'm watching his stream.
[323:54.71]He's having trouble with it too.
[323:58.15]Almost there.
[324:00.00]What happens when he gets it?
[324:05.50]He's having trouble too.
[324:08.12]This sucks.
[324:08.78]He's having trouble.
[324:09.58]I'm getting it too.
[324:11.42]I'm right there with you, man.
[324:13.32]How is that not it?
[324:18.70]That's not it?
[324:28.00]Pick it up!
[324:28.44]Bunch of you guys had it wrong.
[324:50.75]Okay.
[324:51.53]What the fuck is this doing?
[324:52.75]What is this?
[324:53.97]What does he do?
[324:54.65]Quick, tell me what you do.
[325:00.35]What do you do?
[325:10.01]Use the blue code.
[325:21.26]Infinity stones.
[325:29.40]I can't believe I'm fucking still here doing this.
[325:30.90]What am I doing?
[325:31.48]What's happening?
[325:32.96]Why am I doing this?
[325:38.28]Okay, this is it.
[325:39.22]I need one more after this and it's the green door.
[325:51.97]It's that green door, man.
[325:53.19]All I need... Green hall.
[326:03.15]Okay.
[326:07.77]Okay.
[326:08.87]I know what to do.
[326:13.64]What would you rate this game so far?
[326:19.98]What would you rate punching yourself in the stomach as hard as you can?
[326:26.29]Like a zero?
[326:30.21]Eight?
[326:35.01]I'd rate it higher than this.
[326:36.72]Yeah, we lost like a thousand viewers.
[326:38.20]It's alright.
[326:38.68]It don't matter.
[326:39.38]I'll see you tomorrow for Bugsnax.
[326:41.88]I need to spite beat this game.
[326:54.91]This is the worst game you've ever played.
[326:56.11]It might be.
[326:59.45]But at least I can say I finished it.
[327:04.32]I'll be able to wear that on my sleeve forever.
[327:05.70]We have one more door to go into.
[327:08.70]You haven't finished it yet.
[327:16.02]I'm about to.
[327:16.56]Is it worse than Saw II?
[327:19.28]A thousand times worse.
[327:24.22]Saw II would be at the Game Awards ahead of this.
[327:32.46]Alright, green door.
[327:33.28]Turn around when you get to the black opening.
[327:38.34]There's an orb dispenser.
[327:39.32]Is it worse than Watchdog's Legion?
[327:40.82]That's tough.
[327:41.10]No.
[327:41.26]No, it's not.
[328:03.56]You know why?
[328:03.98]Because I'm still playing this.
[328:20.60]The stream was fun.
[328:21.48]It's just awful in every way.
[328:24.37]That's so... Chaotic neutral.
[328:31.25]I have green, right?
[328:36.65]No, I don't.
[328:37.23]I don't have a green door.
[328:39.40]Compare budgets with the current Ubisoft game.
[328:58.13]Friday the 13th.
[328:59.35]Oh, it is Friday the 13th.
[329:00.77]Maybe that's why I'm so fucked up.
[329:03.24]Is that why I'm so fucked up right now?
[329:04.82]I want to do this and like torture myself?
[329:06.88]Is this why?
[329:07.42]It might be.
[329:07.92]It actually really might be why.
[329:16.29]Yeah, this is like a scary stream.
[329:17.85]You're right.
[329:25.74]Well, tomorrow's Friday the Saturday 18th.
[329:29.00]Okay, I'm concerned now because of what I just said.
[329:33.27]Tomorrow's Friday the Saturday 18th.
[329:36.49]Tomorrow's Friday the Saturday?
[329:37.85]I think I'm concerned now.
[329:43.24]What I tried to say was tomorrow was Saturday.
[329:45.78]Tomorrow was Saturday the 14th.
[329:49.10]I don't know what I was trying to say there.
[329:50.14]What was I doing?
[329:51.66]I don't know.
[329:52.02]I don't know.
[329:59.51]How often does Friday the 13th come?
[330:02.05]By the way.
[330:07.37]Is it once a year?
[330:08.07]Once every few years?
[330:08.85]Once every few years?
[330:10.03]Does it happen every year?
[330:25.22]Happens yearly?
[330:29.98]His brain is rotting.
[330:36.25]Someone should check on you.
[330:39.49]Okay, so here is why this game is dumb.
[330:48.87]This is where you get the orb.
[331:06.36]At least my children are crying Jerma.
[331:08.70]They don't want to see this anymore.
[331:09.76]Kids shouldn't be here anyways.
[331:12.54]They should be studying or something.
[331:18.26]Be playing.
[331:28.73]Friday.
[331:30.89]Yeah, they should be playing.
[331:32.89]They should be making like a fort in the house.
[331:35.85]Pillows.
[331:37.81]Mattress toppers.
[331:39.45]Cardboard.
[331:39.97]Alright, let's get out.
[331:50.81]How do I get out of here?
[331:55.32]I flew in this way.
[332:00.66]You don't.
[332:01.02]I don't have to go through the maze again, right?
[332:07.59]No, I probably just walk forward from here.
[332:26.24]I don't know why everyone hates this stream.
[332:27.64]I'm literally... Yep.
[332:29.56]Thanks.
[332:31.86]I have to go through.
[332:33.96]I actually have to go through this.
[332:39.16]It's alright, I think I still have the escape, right?
[332:42.98]What is it?
[332:43.90]Somebody give me, link it to me.
[332:53.98]Thank you.
[332:55.04]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[332:58.63]Okay, forward.
[333:15.61]Thanks for the stream.
[333:16.29]I have a really bad toothache and watching you suffer helps.
[333:20.34]Well, I'm sorry about your teeth.
[333:22.16]Hope that feels better soon.
[333:36.63]Then we go left three times.
[333:51.84]Left again.
[333:52.32]I just fed my cat and took a shower.
[334:00.79]I thought we were on disk four.
[334:02.25]We were.
[334:05.15]Originally.
[334:13.59]One more.
[334:15.53]And then we go right and forward.
[334:26.04]Build a fort on stream.
[334:29.56]That should be kind of fun.
[334:30.22]Can you hurry up?
[334:34.56]My sister's giving birth and I kind of want to be there.
[334:38.02]Oh, don't worry.
[334:38.40]You're not missing much.
[334:39.06]It kind of looks like this.
[334:49.07]I made it!
[334:49.43]Alright, I'm out of there.
[334:55.51]Now we gotta go back to the chamber.
[335:00.18]Which is this way?
[335:01.24]Disk 4, let's go.
[335:07.92]I got all the spheres.
[335:10.14]It's time to end this.
[335:28.44]The dead-less... The deadass... The deadass encounter.
[335:45.41]It's me, the fucking Task Robot here with all the jewels.
[335:49.19]Alright, put them in the device and let's turn on the ship and leave.
[335:52.23]Harry, what the hell's happening?
[335:59.18]Who dares summon me?
[336:04.04]Well, that was... I thought it was going to be much bigger and scarier.
[336:07.94]It's a Furby.
[336:15.12]It's Elmo.
[336:18.66]Did you summon me, Mr. Noodle?
[336:26.08]What are you summoning me for?
[336:27.22]Hold on.
[336:28.55]I'm sparing a little while.
[336:29.87]I think I'm getting ammo.
[336:32.43]Put them in.
[336:34.67]Put them into my spear.
[336:36.77]There are five holes.
[336:54.74]I'm getting a little, it's getting, it's turning into Eddie.
[336:57.52]Yeah, dude, let me try.
[337:02.10]Why do I have a human hand?
[337:04.58]Oh, alright.
[337:05.28]That's not me.
[337:21.15]What about me?
[337:21.93]I, let me do one.
[337:26.16]Guys.
[337:27.82]Guys, you're accidentally bowling under my name.
[337:30.68]Uh... Mike, can I get to... Let me do it.
[337:39.33]Let Casey do it.
[337:56.12]I'm the one that got them all.
[338:01.52]I can't even do one.
[338:02.40]I'm the one that actually went and picked them all up.
[338:04.33]I don't know.
[338:05.11]I mean, now what?
[338:37.88]I don't know.
[338:43.71]Go to orange door.
[338:59.04]The guide says I have to get an alien hand.
[339:01.36]I have to go get an alien hand.
[339:10.83]Didn't get the alien hand.
[339:13.54]To activate the final device, apparently.
[339:18.98]Yes, it was.
[339:19.66]The whole thing was like a paragraph.
[339:22.26]Look, this is what it says.
[339:27.89]This is the end after that.
[339:39.75]This is causing me mental harm.
[339:43.58]Look, why don't you just mute the stream for a minute and just go open up another tab and just go to, like, relaxing puzzles or relaxing music.
[339:57.75]I'm going to sneeze.
[340:01.49]Go to Pornhub.
[340:03.45]Look, I cannot tell you what you can and can't do on your own computer.
[340:09.15]This is the weird thing.
[340:10.03]You might be on Pornhub right now on another tab.
[340:12.55]I don't know.
[340:14.19]You really might be there and you might be listening to me talk, which is kind of weird.
[340:17.05]Turn me off.
[340:17.57]Turn me the fuck off.
[340:18.56]Turn me off right now.
[340:19.74]Don't do that.
[340:21.04]X out of my window and just go out of here.
[340:29.34]What does it want me to do?
[340:34.24]Do not have me on.
[340:35.34]Turn me off with that.
[340:36.28]I don't want you to do that.
[340:50.75]Click red, then blue.
[340:53.55]What?
[341:04.59]Click red, then... Click... Red, then blue, then ar... What do you mean, click?
[341:18.88]Up left?
[341:26.10]Up high is a control device you can close in on.
[341:28.34]To operate it, click red, then blue, violet, orange, and violet.
[341:45.17]I can't touch this.
[341:50.81]Color.
[341:51.92]I can't touch these.
[341:56.48]Oh.
[341:57.48]Okay, click red, then blue.
[342:11.85]Violet.
[342:16.83]Ow!
[342:19.49]Orange, violet.
[342:32.71]Okay.
[342:36.87]Let's get it.
[342:39.89]Good NPC sound.
[342:44.88]Oh.
[342:46.70]Oh.
[342:47.44]It is.
[342:53.99]Cut it out!
[342:55.31]Quit it!
[342:56.55]Ow!
[342:57.59]Stop!
[342:58.69]Ow!
[342:59.71]Ow!
[343:00.61]Stop that!
[343:01.67]Stop that!
[343:02.87]Ow!
[343:03.63]Quit it!
[343:07.27]What do I do now?
[343:16.06]Before this stream, I loved Jerma.
[343:17.90]Hey!
[343:22.35]Okay, now I have this hand.
[343:24.47]Okay.
[343:24.69]Um, now I go back with the hand?
[343:59.71]Eat the hand.
[344:00.23]Oh, right.
[344:01.77]I'm supposed to eat this.
[344:10.68]Cut my hand.
[344:11.28]It hasn't been cleaned yet.
[344:16.36]You're losing viewers.
[344:18.35]Look, I know.
[344:19.65]Look, I've been losing viewers for the last, like, three hours.
[344:21.81]I don't think I'm aware of this.
[344:23.35]I know.
[344:26.87]I know.
[344:42.78]Here's the career ending stream.
[344:47.06]It's alright.
[344:48.40]It was fun.
[344:48.74]It was fun where it lasted.
[344:59.10]What, did I fart?
[345:05.09]Oh, right, right.
[345:10.37]I was gonna say, you both blamed it on me.
[345:11.93]It's more on you two.
[345:17.77]Wait, that's not what I had to do?
[345:21.71]What the fuck?
[345:24.69]What?
[345:34.06]Where's the hand?
[345:40.40]Where is it?
[345:49.47]Look up, you fucking idiot.
[345:50.95]I'm not looking up because you told me to.
[345:55.79]Insert disk one.
[346:08.56]Why am I doing Earthworm Jim?
[346:11.57]Where did that come from?
[346:26.94]I'm bashing my head against the wall.
[346:31.50]Auto-tune?
[346:32.02]I don't have auto-tune on.
[346:32.76]This is it.
[346:38.09]This is the end.
[346:39.13]We made it to the end.
[346:40.51]Final cutscene on disk one.
[346:44.15]Alien Hand.
[346:46.90]Why did I play this for six hours?
[346:48.98]This was supposed to be like a 3DO grab bag stream, not Die Dallas Encounter full playthrough.
[347:22.81]It worked!
[347:23.79]Ciao!
[347:23.89]Uh, are we just like going into this thing's mouth?
[348:06.33]Warm up your laser case.
[348:07.59]I got a bad feeling about this.
[348:09.48]We've gotten this far, Zack.
[348:10.56]Just stay cool.
[348:11.68]Stay cool?
[348:12.32]I'm gonna stay cool.
[348:12.98]Come on.
[348:13.36]It's gotta be 85 in here and rising.
[348:20.23]He was disguised all along.
[348:22.01]Yes!
[348:22.91]You got a live one, Case.
[348:24.77]Go check him out.
[348:28.95]You see that?
[348:30.07]Oh is he disguised as navigational console think this guy'll mind if we hijack his ship see what Casey comes up with I'd shoot him He's adjusting those light beams What's that thing in the center
[348:48.42]I don't know, Airy, but things are starting to heat up around here.
[348:50.48]Look, we gotta do something.
[348:51.36]We gotta do something now.
[348:53.63]Shit, he sees us.
[348:54.69]What?
[348:55.01]Go for the nav consoles.
[348:55.95]I'll cover you.
[348:56.65]Wait, Zach, don't shoot it.
[348:57.89]It's unarmed.
[348:58.73]We gotta try and communicate.
[349:00.49]How?
[349:00.77]Come on, this thing isn't exactly happy to see us, Airy.
[349:03.25]But that's the statue guy.
[349:05.03]Lower your weapon, Zach.
[349:06.13]Show it we mean no harm.
[349:08.29]This is like the guy's... Oh, he's putting his hands up.
[349:12.68]How does he know that?
[349:13.74]Airy, it didn't work.
[349:16.32]Get to those consoles.
[349:18.48]Hey, whoa!
[349:20.94]I guess we're killing him.
[349:24.77]What?
[349:25.11]I shot him in his brain.
[349:39.34]Is he dead?
[349:49.78]What?
[349:50.28]What am I supposed to do?
[349:51.06]There's another alien?
[349:52.10]There's two aliens.
[349:55.32]This is boss two.
[349:58.08]Zack, get up!
[350:02.11]It has to be a giant egg.
[350:06.39]Alright.
[350:07.81]Tighten the light beams?
[350:15.55]What?
[350:16.78]Data!

[350:24.43]Oh, no.
[350:34.92]You take a gun into a grenade?
[350:37.70]What the fuck?
[350:45.29]I don't think I did it right.
[350:52.92]Whoops.
[350:53.47]Okay.
[350:53.93]Alright.
[350:54.25]No, no, no, no, no.
[350:58.07]I have to... I can't even react to this shit, man.
[351:04.52]It's just so stupid.
[351:06.76]Alright.
[351:07.42]Interact with the console?
[351:08.58]Okay.
[351:21.29]Okay, I'm moving, I'm moving.
[351:22.16]Alright.
[351:23.70]Okay, I got it.
[351:24.50]Red, orange, red.
[351:27.16]Green, blue, green, blue.
[351:29.52]Violet, blue.
[351:30.36]Okay, touch.
[351:33.56]What do I do?
[351:35.22]What do I do?
[351:35.60]What do I do?
[351:35.98]Analyze.
[351:36.68]Yes, no, no.
[351:37.87]Press this button.
[351:38.41]Press green.
[351:45.09]What do you want me to do?
[351:51.26]I can't- I don't have a- I don't have a- This is riddly.
[352:03.81]Alright, but I don't know what to press.
[352:15.65]Go back before Zack is dead.
[352:20.50]I need more orbs?
[352:23.72]Okay, the nav console.
[352:32.38]Redo the other scene.
[352:34.04]Let me try this one more time.
[352:37.21]Go back.
[352:37.59]You have to talk to the... Alright, wait.
[352:39.01]Okay, go back and talk to the alien?
[352:40.55]Okay.
[352:52.45]Talk to the alien talk talk to the alien None of them work
[353:22.21]After the elevator ride, you will see a live alien.
[353:24.59]When they ask you to talk to it, send 4-5-2.
[353:25.95]What is 4-5-2?
[353:26.67]Is- Okay, I have a question.
[353:27.93]Is this 4-5-2?
[353:54.33]This is 452, isn't it?
[353:55.31]Alright.
[353:57.05]I'm ready.
[353:58.11]How did it gain viewers?
[354:18.28]I don't know.
[354:22.95]Don't let them shoot it.
[354:24.09]I'm going to just be pressing it.
[354:34.44]I shot him in the brain.
[354:36.70]His brain just evaporated.
[354:50.43]Sacrifice your friends.
[354:51.39]I did that twice.
[354:57.55]OK, here we go.
[354:57.99]They all fly away.
[355:00.39]We go into this room.
[355:01.51]This guy's pressing buttons and I talk.
[355:07.38]Warm up your laser case.
[355:08.66]I got a bad feeling about this.
[355:10.54]We've gotten this far, Zack.
[355:11.70]Just stay cool.
[355:12.74]Stay cool?
[355:13.98]Come on, it's gotta be 85 in here and rising.
[355:16.89]It's really not that hot.
[355:20.65]There he is.
[355:21.51]Talk to it.
[355:23.07]Yes!
[355:23.87]We got a live one, Case.
[355:25.83]Go check him out.
[355:29.83]Alright, talk. 452.
[355:48.24]452.
[355:48.32]Talk now.
[355:48.82]I'm pressing A. No, no, no.
[355:50.24]Talk, talk, talk.
[355:50.94]452.
[355:50.96]I'm pressing A. Communicate.
[355:51.92]Send it.
[355:52.22]I'm hitting A.
[356:20.23]Something's coming out.
[356:23.71]Is it?
[356:25.11]Look at that thing.
[356:25.81]Is it angry?
[356:26.67]That shell was some kind of chrysalis.
[356:29.31]This is fantastic.
[356:31.69]We must be the first humans ever to witness this.
[356:34.40]Yeah, right.
[356:35.14]I hope we don't look like appetizers.
[356:36.80]It looks different from the other creatures we've seen.
[356:41.68]Look, the other one is bowing.
[356:44.68]Maybe this is the new queen.
[356:50.24]We should make a gesture.
[356:51.56]Uncut gems music.
[356:54.18]Ow, Zach.
[356:54.60]What?
[356:55.88]No, no way.
[356:57.29]Ow.
[356:59.13]Ow.
[357:07.09]Artemis Log, the force field created by the creatures which call themselves SETI, protected us and the ship from the intense heat.
[357:15.60]The Kryn either fled or were destroyed when we passed through the star's Corona.
[357:19.96]The newly born queen possesses race memory and incredible psychokinetic abilities.
[357:25.81]She improved Kacy's translation abilities and then answered many of our questions.
[357:31.53]She even repaired the Artemis.
[357:34.85]Why is she talking like Cartman?
[357:44.32]Take voyage, friends.
[357:45.36]May our paths cross again.
[357:46.82]Farewell.
[357:47.46]You know, Case, you were right all along.
[357:49.64]There is no such thing as a hopeless situation.
[357:53.02]Being that there's no such thing as a hopeless situation.
[357:55.26]Harry, I was wondering if you would come with me to check out.
[357:58.06]I'm having a problem with the mattress in the stateroom, and it seems to not be level, and I would need somebody to lay on the other side of it.
[358:05.78]There's this electronic gadget I got from Vesuvius 7.
[358:08.82]I don't really know how it works, but maybe you could show it to me.
[358:20.22]Here comes, like, the rock song.
[358:21.10]Alright, for a second I thought Tia Correa was a developer on the game.
[358:27.73]I was like, are you serious?
[358:33.41]Uh, uh, sorry.
[358:34.37]Sorry.
[358:35.64]Uh, can you hear me now?
[358:36.44]Sorry.
[358:37.06]Sorry.
[358:37.24]I'm trying to get you out.
[358:52.68]Wait through the credits.
[358:56.32]You should feel ashamed of yourself for doing this.
[358:58.66]Look.
[359:00.04]I feel fine.
[359:00.90]I feel great.
[359:01.56]I just feel... I just kind of have a headache now.
[359:28.58]Best Boy.
[359:35.95]Smush.
[359:40.53]Trouble with the maples and their quince and ginseng rinds.
[359:46.93]You see the oaks are far too greedy to take up all the light.
[360:06.15]Ow, my ears.
[360:07.27]Quick time for Windows 2.0.
[360:10.01]That's very old.
[360:48.76]Did I shoot her accidentally?
[361:06.86]That's not what I wanted to do.
[361:14.38]No, that was wrong.
[361:47.38]Okay, I turned off the, uh, I just turned it off.
[361:53.43]Turned it off, I got out.
[361:58.37]Wait, the camera's on and I got no clothes on.
[362:03.08]Alright, that's, I think that's kind of where I have to end the stream.
[362:07.64]It's been six hours, I gotta go.
[362:16.48]I didn't think I was gonna spend... Alright, we're gonna do it.
[362:18.00]We're gonna go back to 3DO.
[362:19.88]On, probably, Sunday.
[362:22.39]One game Andy.
[362:25.59]The 3DO was your greatest mistake.
[362:28.33]No, I'm playing 3DO.
[362:29.41]I love this console.
[362:30.35]I just don't... I'm playing 3DO later this weekend.
[362:32.57]I'm gonna do it.
[362:35.24]We're playing Bugsnax tomorrow.
[362:37.48]And then maybe Bugsnax on Sunday.
[362:39.10]Maybe 3DO next weekend.
[362:40.62]I don't know.
[362:41.34]There's still like... Well, there's like 20 games on 3DO.
[362:45.94]I just tortured everybody.
[362:48.18]You literally made a stream of Die Dallas Electric Boogaloo.
[362:52.40]Okay.
[362:53.95]Yeah, Bugsnax is tomorrow.
[362:55.59]Yeah, I play Demon's Souls.
[362:56.53]I don't have a PlayStation 5.
[362:57.75]I forgot it came out.
[363:01.11]I didn't pre-order one.
[363:01.83]I didn't even know it came out.
[363:03.71]Etalyx told me that it came out.
[363:05.43]I didn't even know it came out.
[363:07.18]I forgot it even existed.
[363:15.35]Which is fine, don't worry.
[363:17.25]I'll get one, eventually.
[363:23.12]I will get one eventually, and I'll play the games on it.
[363:27.50]There's only like three games on it anyways.
[363:30.06]And the first generation, the first generation of new games on a new console is always, always just games that were already in development for the old console that they ended up just pushing forward to the new one anyways.
[363:42.28]So I'm fine for like another six months.
[363:47.15]Don't worry.
[363:50.53]There's a few games that were made specifically for the PS5.
[363:53.37]But besides that, I mean, whatever.
[363:55.87]I'll get a link in a few months.
[363:59.79]That's Cope.
[364:00.61]Yeah, it is.
[364:03.23]Alright, I'm gonna send you guys to Joel, actually, because you know what Joel is playing tonight.
[364:09.27]Joel is playing Half-Life Alyx.
[364:11.49]So, that's pretty pog.
[364:16.12]That's a huge pug.
[364:17.51]So, I'm going to send you guys to Joel.
[364:22.65]It's actually a good streamer.
[364:24.65]Alright, you're banned for life.
[364:26.04]I'm, I'm, no, you know what?
[364:27.70]Let's go.
[364:28.28]Let's go.
[364:28.62]Where's that comment?
[364:29.46]Where is it?
[364:29.78]You're getting banned for life.
[364:31.42]I'm going to do it myself.
[364:32.38]You're going to be able to screenshot Jerma, not if I've banned you for life.
[364:42.44]Good ending or riot.
[364:43.52]I already got the good ending.
[364:44.58]We just did it.
[364:45.00]They, like, solved all the world's problems, and we got all their, like, devices.
[364:48.42]Alright, let's, uh, actually, let's go make sure I didn't miss any money or anything.
[364:55.02]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[364:55.74]We'll see you tomorrow.
[364:58.02]Tomorrow is Bugsnax.
[364:59.94]Playing that for a little bit.
[365:04.72]Give a very special shout-out and thank you to, uh, Sharfers, the streamer.
[365:11.28]Speedrun's Die Dallas Encounter.
[365:12.98]Only reason why I was able to even complete the game is because he exists.
[365:16.27]It's the only reason why.
[365:25.34]Without that, we would have to rely on 20-year-old GameFAQs write-ups.
[365:31.18]The MVP.
[365:38.01]Let me minimize this, though.
[365:40.85]Let me minimize that.
[365:42.65]I think I X'd out of a ton of things.
[365:44.93]Hold on.
[365:47.16]Yeah, I did.
[365:50.34]I just want to see if there was any large bit drops or donations or anything.
[365:55.76]There was.
[365:58.58]There was a shitload of community subs, too.
[366:00.72]We had 10 from Putrefaction.
[366:04.42]We had 10 from Nearshoe.
[366:05.90]We had 10 from Anonymous.
[366:07.26]We had 10 from The Wheel of Rhyme.
[366:10.56]And then 5 from Illusiary.
[366:12.52]Thanks, guys.
[366:15.14]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[366:18.90]Thank you for your community subs.
[366:23.22]And then there was 50 bucks.
[366:24.64]It was 5,000 bits from Scrumpleton.
[366:28.38]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[366:31.22]A gigantic bit drop.
[366:35.31]Jerem, if you need to talk, we're here for you.
[366:36.87]It's clear your mental health is deteriorating.
[366:38.79]We love you, dude, so don't stress out.
[366:49.28]He wasted his ego stream on this.
[366:52.61]Yeah, I did.
[366:53.15]I did.
[366:54.61]It was in a panic.
[366:55.37]It was in a rage.
[366:56.19]I need to look at this.
[367:05.62]Why is it Peter?
[367:13.56]Don't go to twitch.tv/jermaOn a file on November 13th, 2020.
[367:17.69]Worst mistake of my entire life, Lois.
[367:32.29]It wasn't the worst mistake of your life.
[367:35.17]Eating the McChicken that you put in the fridge that's been an uncountable, unrememberable amount of days, but you hope it was less than five, and you eat it, was the worst mistake of your life.
[367:49.98]So don't even be, don't even be cute with me.
[367:57.45]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[367:58.85]Go say hello to Joel.
[368:01.61]I played through that game.
[368:02.43]I beat Half-Life, Alex.
[368:03.27]Let's see how Joel does.
[368:04.06]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[368:11.18]Good night, goodbye, and thank you for joining me on a stream that a lot of people were very, very happy with.
[368:18.82]I can't even fucking talk.
[368:21.04]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow for Bugsnax.
[368:23.94]Eat them up.
[368:26.34]Good night, guys.
[368:26.74]I'll see you tomorrow.
[368:29.88]you
[369:04.18]you
