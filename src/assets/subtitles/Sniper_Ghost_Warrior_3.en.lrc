[00:00.89]Alright, we're back.
[00:03.45]We're fucking back.
[00:06.27]God damn it.
[00:09.49]I could've, like, spent more time in there, like, everyone, like, look, here we are.
[00:14.15]Which one am I, just camping or the escape of Lydia?
[00:16.27]I don't know, I don't know.
[00:21.19]Should we just try this one?
[00:21.99]I'm not muted, I'm here.
[00:28.17]Go back to the WALL-E game
[00:35.78]God, please not this game.
[00:37.98]I can't win.
[00:39.18]I'm trying to... This game is so much worse.
[00:50.49]Hey, come on.
[00:51.23]Give me a break.
[00:52.51]What do you want from me?
[00:54.09]What do you guys want from me?
[00:59.18]Hold on.
[00:59.90]I got some bits.
[01:06.25]Just end the stream.
[01:07.49]No, I'm not.
[01:08.33]We're going to do the other one.
[01:10.73]Hey, thank you, Y. Kayla.
[01:13.95]Seeking Blue, the Anilander.
[01:16.18]Miguel Mean Green.
[01:18.20]Nina.
[01:19.24]Jen Petters.
[01:22.34]James.
[01:23.66]James Sir.
[01:25.91]Mr. Sandman.
[01:27.21]Thank you guys for the bits.
[01:28.99]Especially all you guys.
[01:31.89]Especially you guys.
[01:33.95]Thanks.
[01:34.63]Thanks to everybody, by the way.
[01:35.84]We want phone home now.
[01:36.88]Well, you're not getting it.
[01:39.70]You're not gonna get it.
[01:40.54]You're gonna get the escape of Lydia.
[01:41.92]I don't even know what the fuck this is.
[01:42.84]I don't even care.
[01:44.04]Challenge mode.
[01:46.78]Get fucking destroyed.
[01:48.34]I don't even know how to play this game.
[01:51.46]I have no idea.
[01:57.07]I don't even know what this is.
[02:09.37]Point and shoot.
[02:10.15]That's it, huh?
[02:13.76]This is getting serious.
[02:14.80]Yeah, you bet.
[02:16.56]We're doing like the secondary campaign.
[02:18.66]I haven't even done the tutorial.
[02:22.86]I have no idea.
[02:26.56]The escape of Lydia.
[02:27.98]Like, this is assuming that I played the shit out of the first part of the game, like, the actual game.
[02:33.91]Good, cutscene.
[02:37.37]Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet!
[02:42.49]See, this is, like, after the game.
[02:45.05]The game already ended.
[02:45.73]I already beat the game.
[02:50.63]This is, like, the last scene where you, like, you're on the ground and, like, here's the DLC.
[02:57.23]Cut the bullshit.
[02:58.09]They're coming.
[02:59.45]Let's go.
[02:59.99]Who's gonna give me control?
[03:04.63]Come on, soldier.
[03:05.57]Stay with me.
[03:06.91]Here we go.
[03:09.27]No, not yet.
[03:11.33]No skipping.
[03:12.93]Shit.
[03:13.53]Incoming.
[03:17.99]I've been hit.
[03:18.67]Why would you turn with a pistol, dude?
[03:27.82]Nice.
[03:29.18]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[03:32.82]I should have shot that guy.
[03:34.08]Get him.
[03:36.21]Snap a snack.
[03:41.25]Nice neck snap.
[03:45.37]We would care about these characters if I played the actual game.
[03:48.88]How did you find me?
[03:49.94]Motherfucker.
[03:51.48]When you threw the general, I mean, Rokva's father out the window... When you threw that gun, it was really cool.
[03:57.84]So I went to Avas.
[04:01.31]Shit, you dragged him into this?
[04:03.72]You couldn't stay in a military jail at the base.
[04:05.76]They'd execute you.
[04:07.58]So, have us pull some strings to move you to a high-security prison in Tbilisi.
[04:12.30]And that would help me how exactly?
[04:14.46]We were supposed to break you out during the transport, but Rokhva was faster.
[04:19.92]Fuck.
[04:20.78]Just my luck.
[04:23.92]Rockwell wants revenge for his dirtbag father's accident.
[04:26.95]He'll hunt me.
[04:27.73]You have to leave the country.
[04:29.77]I started this whole mess.
[04:31.45]Now, I have to finish it.
[04:32.83]No, I'm not going to skip the movie.
[04:33.73]This attitude of yours is going to get you killed one day.
[04:36.58]Thanks, Cassandra.
[04:37.82]Now shut up and move.
[04:40.20]I'm about to skip the movie.
[04:41.50]You guys are right, I'm gonna skip the movie.
[04:44.66]Back to Wally.
[04:45.28]You guys wanted this.
[04:46.04]You guys wanted me to leave Wally and come into here.
[04:48.89]Now we're gonna sleep in the rocks.
[04:50.47]I can change the difficulty, like, in the settings menu, right?
[04:52.21]Let's say it's a private business.
[05:07.72]I know all Roquefort's family and they're not good people.
[05:10.90]I believe the general dared to abuse you and you were just defending yourself.
[05:15.50]Now, do have some rest.
[05:18.56]I left you the radio there.
[05:20.18]Take it.
[05:21.30]I had to do it.
[05:23.48]Comes check.
[05:24.52]Comes check.
[05:25.14]I had to do that.
[05:26.64]I hope you hear me, Lydia.
[05:28.44]Once you're in the kiddie village, find the werewolf and put his rifle to good use.
[05:32.42]I don't know how to play.
[05:33.78]He also knows where Roquefort's hiding.
[05:36.63]Does anyone know how to play?
[05:42.29]Okay.
[05:44.29]I don't have a HUD.
[05:45.23]Shit.
[05:49.91]I don't have a fucking HUD.
[05:50.99]I don't have a compass.
[05:52.17]I have nothing.
[05:56.26]Just left click to shoot.
[05:57.38]That's all I... I don't know anything else.
[06:03.54]Okay.
[06:03.66]Okay.
[06:06.15]There's a silencer.
[06:07.11]Alright.
[06:10.87]Alright, spaces jump.
[06:11.69]Can I get in cars?
[06:15.21]I'm like a giant.
[06:19.66]Uh... There's no door open.
[06:22.90]I don't think any windows are any doors.
[06:24.52]Nothing opens.
[06:24.96]You can't go anywhere.
[06:27.44]Why does it never hold left click to melee or vault?
[06:30.56]I'm not doing anything.
[06:31.86]Oh, there's a guy right there.
[06:35.03]No, we have to snipe this guy.
[06:35.97]This is called Sniper Ghost Wolf 3.
[06:37.64]I have to snipe this guy.
[06:38.96]Okay, that guy's dead.
[06:43.02]Good job.
[06:45.60]Did I win?
[06:46.60]Did I win the game?
[06:47.44]Okay, see you later.
[06:51.14]What do you have on him?
[06:55.84]They stole that.
[06:58.60]That's from the other sniper game.
[07:02.98]That's from the other sniper game.
[07:05.12]That exact animation is from Sniper Elite.
[07:08.38]Is this the same company?
[07:15.63]Okay, I'm kind of annoyed that I don't have any... I can't see anything.
[07:23.41]We have to do that.
[07:28.60]Who gives a shit?
[07:29.38]Let's just go.
[07:31.70]Anybody in the windows?
[07:39.98]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[07:40.56]Okay, it's telling me people are seeing me.
[07:42.64]From where?
[07:43.10]Oh, the guy right there?
[07:44.04]Alright.
[07:52.14]We got him.
[07:56.80]Okay, we're good.
[07:58.04]I'm on the... Guys, give me a break.
[07:59.96]I'm on the hardest fucking difficulty.
[08:04.12]I'm on the difficulty that it's like the realism joke mode.
[08:19.46]I should probably reload this.
[08:23.64]How do you crouch?
[08:24.90]Alright, I got to get rid of this.
[08:25.98]Let me do the thing where you go pat, pat, pat.
[08:37.62]Wait, where, where, where, where?
[08:38.56]Where is he?
[08:38.88]Where is he?
[08:42.22]Where is he?
[08:44.34]Is he sitting over there or is he in the window?
[08:46.01]We've got a casualty.
[08:47.79]Can I throw a grenade up there?
[08:52.93]Oh shit, hold on.
[08:54.15]Wait, I have like the hitman instinct.
[09:06.16]I hear footsteps.
[09:13.00]You guys are fucking terrible.
[09:14.68]You guys are bad at this.
[09:16.90]Wait, a guy.
[09:25.90]Shit!
[09:27.97]Where?
[09:33.03]Hold on.
[09:33.83]What?
[09:38.13]Oh, god damn it.
[09:39.33]Okay, I'm... At least I know where they all are.
[09:51.18]I'm turning this shit off.
[09:52.98]Give me the setting.
[09:55.32]Difficulty.
[09:56.34]Difficulty.
[09:56.96]Get it out of here.
[09:57.52]We're going on the fucking normal mode.
[09:59.82]Aim assistance.
[10:00.62]Absolutely.
[10:01.66]And the red.
[10:02.28]Yes.
[10:02.62]Accept.
[10:04.72]Okay.
[10:05.06]Good.
[10:08.38]See.
[10:09.15]Give me like a menu for crying out loud.
[10:13.81]Infiltrate the village.
[10:15.19]Now I'm good.
[10:16.97]That's all I needed.
[10:20.54]Bad gamer.
[10:21.50]Let me just see what the buttons are.
[10:23.08]There's a guy that comes over here.
[10:34.22]Coward, coward, coward.
[10:39.98]Long shot.
[10:41.58]Really?
[10:41.86]Is there a guy up there?
[10:47.73]I should have just started the actual campaign.
[10:52.04]Holy shit, dude.
[10:52.64]Will you slow it down?
[10:53.34]Okay, there's a bullet drop.
[10:56.70]I have to shoot there.
[10:57.38]Where's his head?
[11:02.55]This is a sniper game, guys.
[11:07.63]I have to, like, actually snipe.
[11:11.57]Dude, hold your hand still.
[11:13.43]It's not that hard to... Oh my lord.
[11:25.01]Show your face.
[11:27.69]Okay, we're getting finally an animation.
[11:37.58]That is not nearly as cool as it is in the other game.
[11:40.96]You're standing with a 15-pound gun.
[11:42.60]Let's just wait for him.
[12:07.94]It's called a laser.
[12:12.25]I like the noise that it makes.
[12:13.47]You know when you take a picture with a digital... Not a digital, one of those disposable cameras.
[12:20.51]It makes that like... The flash reloading.
[12:23.39]I like that noise.
[12:24.03]That guy died so fast.
[12:35.94]That was too fast.
[12:40.14]That guy's pretending to be dead because I didn't hit him.
[12:50.12]I guess I can go in here.
[12:57.76]That's a slide.
[12:58.68]He's going to show up.
[13:04.32]No, he's not.
[13:06.50]Hang.
[13:13.32]Get down from here.
[13:14.08]I need to get like... I want to get a good headshot here.
[13:31.87]Come on!
[13:32.51]Where's the animation?
[13:39.23]I thought wait, I need to see this I think I'm still alive?
[13:50.70]I guess Like seriously, oh my fucking god, I'm like I'm trying to see
[14:08.52]Oh, this game is... Why did I pick to do this one?
[14:12.76]Why did I pick this one?
[14:15.54]Why did I pick this?
[14:17.51]Lydia's fucking... The joke was like... And now I can't do anything else.
[14:22.07]I have to do this.
[14:27.52]We have to get to the end of this.
[14:29.44]I have to.
[14:31.12]You know what I mean?
[14:31.70]Like, I have to.
[14:32.74]No more fucking around.
[14:33.54]We're gonna actually play the game.
[14:34.72]Let's get, like, kills.
[14:38.14]I don't care about how fast people fall down.
[14:40.32]Like, they have magnets in their body.
[14:43.18]We're just gonna go through this.
[14:51.45]Like, it's a very funny game.
[14:53.03]I assure it is.
[14:53.71]It's a funny joke game.
[14:59.05]It don't matter.
[15:04.52]Watch out for the windows.
[15:05.58]I'm just gonna get up here.
[15:06.92]I don't have the right gamer gear.
[15:10.48]I know, it's true.
[15:11.83]Can I, like, jump up this?
[15:13.25]You can.
[15:13.59]You can actually jump up things.
[15:14.71]I didn't know that.
[15:15.27]We didn't do any tutorials or anything, guys.
[15:16.87]This guy's done.
[15:19.55]See you later.
[15:22.19]Anybody in here?
[15:22.81]Anybody patrols in here or anything, right?
[15:30.52]No.
[15:30.92]Good.
[15:34.49]There's a guy over here.
[15:39.89]Boo.
[15:43.79]I will accept the boos, but we have to get to the end of this.
[15:47.39]At least this Bliffle.
[15:57.85]I see the enemy.
[15:58.43]What do you mean you see the enemy?
[16:06.77]That's never gonna get old.
[16:08.29]That is never gonna get old, I swear to God.
[16:19.96]Where?
[16:20.80]What the fuck?
[16:23.84]How did that get- I'm going to the main menu, and we're gonna start the fucking game from the beginning, not the DLC campaign.
[16:29.66]Okay?
[16:30.38]Go back.
[16:31.18]Get out of here.
[16:32.14]Go back to the campaign.
[16:33.14]Campaign, new game.
[16:34.08]We're going normal mode.
[16:36.68]Done.
[16:37.64]Let's go.
[16:38.04]I can't.
[16:52.97]Stop screaming at me.
[16:56.65]Look, everybody can blame fucking GOG.com for this bullshit, alright?
[17:01.34]Those of you guys that are here right now, let's discuss this.
[17:04.84]I bought a game on GOG.com and it doesn't open.
[17:09.88]That's the whole story.
[17:10.92]There you go.
[17:11.60]And like, of course, of course, Jeremiah buys video games that don't work.
[17:17.88]Even ones that are sold by fucking virtual machine emulation companies.
[17:23.90]Like, GOG exists for you to play those games.
[17:27.46]And now there's like a fucking lawnmower going on out here.
[17:31.20]Who's mowing their lawn at 8.30 at night?
[17:36.10]Hold on a second.
[17:37.37]This is how you greet your superior officer, you fucking asshole!
[17:41.75]I knew you'd come.
[17:42.53]Thank God.
[17:43.89]I figured I might as well... Nobody cares about this.
[17:52.78]Just disable chat and play.
[18:03.94]Guys, there's nobody mowing the lawn.
[18:05.54]That's my air conditioner.
[18:06.80]ETA two minutes, boys.
[18:11.48]John, really?
[18:13.16]Shut up.
[18:15.06]Yeah, shut up is right.
[18:15.92]Let's go.
[18:19.10]Don't do that again.
[18:49.81]This is it.
[18:50.69]The Russian-Ukrainian border.
[18:52.45]Not sure what I was expecting.
[18:54.25]Com check.
[18:54.97]Frank, can you hear me?
[18:56.29]Over.
[18:56.91]Loud and clear.
[18:57.48]Why would they let you do this?
[19:06.42]Why would they let you do this?
[19:10.21]This is it.
[19:11.07]The Russian-Ukrainian border.
[19:12.15]Don't do that again.
[19:12.91]Not sure what I was expecting.
[19:14.65]Com check.
[19:15.39]Frank, can you hear me?
[19:16.39]Stop shooting.
[19:17.35]Loud and clear.
[19:27.64]I had to do every gun This is it the Russian-Ukrainian border not sure what I was expecting I'm gonna accidentally kill this fucking guy just wait What do you mean grenade I have grenades
[19:46.66]No, I don't.
[19:47.72]Oh, I wish I had a grenade.
[19:49.28]Do I have grenades?
[19:51.48]Gee.
[19:52.40]I don't think I have grenades.
[19:54.02]Oh, I so totally would.
[19:55.22]Tap, press tab to open the tutorial.
[20:08.25]Scout mode, control.
[20:09.45]I didn't know about scout mode, see?
[20:15.06]Okay, cool.
[20:15.94]It lets you find mines.
[20:17.60]And see people.
[20:21.08]Can I, like, quick save?
[20:22.14]I can't.
[20:22.74]Oh my god, I want to push him off the edge.
[20:24.96]What's melee?
[20:25.60]Oh my gosh.
[20:28.46]I need to push him off.
[20:29.97]What's melee?
[20:30.49]There has to be a melee.
[20:31.25]I need to look it up.
[20:33.53]Is there a melee?
[20:34.37]It's important.
[20:36.17]This is the important fucking question.
[20:41.41]No.
[20:42.23]It's not.
[20:44.26]I see.
[20:44.50]Let's go elevation up.
[20:45.67]Yeah, hold breath, I guess.
[20:58.82]Hold M1.
[20:59.46]It's not doing anything.
[21:01.89]Careful.
[21:02.59]The rocks might be slippery.
[21:04.69]After you.
[21:05.87]Always first.
[21:07.43]Hey, you're the one holding the Navy Cross.
[21:09.81]I didn't fight for that.
[21:11.25]Yeah, yeah.
[21:12.45]Just go.
[21:13.39]We don't have all day.
[21:14.21]I almost just fucking fell off.
[21:17.61]See that?
[21:18.65]Piece of cake.
[21:19.98]Good job.
[21:22.68]God damn it!
[21:24.00]Don't give me these...
[21:29.25]I wasn't supposed to go that way.
[21:31.87]Okay, I already like this game.
[21:38.77]I already like this game.
[21:39.96]Go down!
[21:41.42]God damn it.
[21:42.34]Okay.
[21:42.58]I was hoping he was gonna slide down.
[21:56.44]Okay, no more fucking around.
[21:57.88]I did not make that.
[22:02.83]I did not make that at all.
[22:04.59]Alright, where do you want me to go?
[22:06.83]Approach the ledge and press to jump and grab it.
[22:10.69]What the hell do you want me to do?
[22:11.45]Down here?
[22:11.85]Isn't that what I just tried to do?
[22:23.40]I'm not sure what you want me to do here, dude.
[22:30.91]Oh, there's like these stupid ledges.
[22:32.39]Okay.
[22:41.46]I'll catch ya!
[22:41.98]Okay, we keep navigating apparently.
[22:49.30]That was very, very easy.
[22:50.38]Okay, you saw.
[22:54.10]You saw me do what it said.
[22:59.78]You literally watched me do what it told me to do.
[23:02.48]And it didn't work.
[23:10.71]See that?
[23:11.73]Piece of cake.
[23:15.77]You watched me do it.
[23:16.93]I did it.
[23:18.63]Watch this.
[23:21.15]Jump and grab the next ledge.
[23:23.77]Worked that time.
[23:24.37]Alright.
[23:25.51]So am I. Hey, we didn't want to program me following you around, so I'm here too.
[23:29.77]Fuck.
[23:30.03]Are those dogs?
[23:48.87]What the fuck was that?
[23:50.63]What just happened?
[23:51.51]What the fuck was that?
[23:55.81]He just like auto-aimed to a thing that appeared in front of the fucking path.
[24:01.18]What?
[24:03.00]Scout mode.
[24:03.68]No, I see.
[24:03.92]A tree can be shot.
[24:04.44]Explosive bullets.
[24:20.11]Okay.
[24:24.47]Explosive bullets.
[24:25.47]Got it.
[24:32.71]Hold alt.
[24:34.65]And use the bullet wheel.
[24:39.99]Damn it.
[24:55.44]How far back am I going to be?
[24:58.80]Wait, wait, wait.
[24:59.88]Why didn't they have to... Don't cut me off so quickly.
[25:02.76]What now?
[25:03.52]Oh, shit!
[25:05.14]John?
[25:06.44]John!
[25:13.35]Ah, it's alright.
[25:14.45]We're never going to get past this.
[25:15.85]You guys didn't want me to play this game?
[25:17.49]How?
[25:18.49]Why?
[25:21.27]What now?
[25:22.71]Let me have a look around.
[25:28.64]One more time.
[25:29.22]This is the last time.
[25:38.65]That's it.
[25:38.97]No, come on.
[25:39.71]Fuck you, dude.
[25:40.39]You don't just, like, you don't bend your leg.
[25:43.41]You don't, like, twist your ankle when you get a fucking explosion on you.
[25:47.51]I remember the time.
[25:48.41]I get your first idea.
[25:51.31]Yeah.
[25:52.67]What now?
[25:54.12]Let me have a look around.
[25:55.04]See that scorched tree?
[25:56.54]Oh, damn.
[25:59.39]Explode him in the face?
[26:01.30]I could do that.
[26:01.78]Goddamn.
[26:02.12]Hold on.
[26:02.82]Hey, what's up dude?
[26:03.44]How are ya?
[26:27.11]Okay, I gotta stop this.

[26:30.44]I'm done.
[26:30.80]I'm done.
[26:31.08]I'm done.
[26:31.54]No more.
[26:34.12]No more.
[26:36.12]I'm in a weird mood now, guys.
[26:37.38]I'm sorry.
[26:38.52]I'm really sorry.
[26:39.28]Haha, he died.
[26:42.12]I'm sorry.
[26:44.65]I'm sorry.
[26:47.19]I tried to do that last time and what the fuck?
[26:49.67]It didn't work.
[27:00.89]I'm gonna jump over this one.
[27:02.47]I remember the times when it'd be your first idea.
[27:05.69]Okay.
[27:06.05]Yeah.
[27:07.41]What now?
[27:07.83]I tried to do that last time.
[27:10.09]Don't ask me.
[27:11.55]Get out of the way.
[27:12.15]You're going first.
[27:13.31]Yes, Sergeant North, sir.
[27:15.31]Be careful.
[27:16.23]Yeah, I know.
[27:17.59]Chill.
[27:20.86]He's going first.
[27:21.50]Fuck.
[27:22.60]God damn it.
[27:24.40]No, don't do it.
[27:25.64]We've already got over it.
[27:26.58]I'm done with... I could knock him off the fucking bridge.
[27:33.22]Done.
[27:33.89]Okay.
[27:36.63]Do it.
[27:37.01]Do it.
[27:37.33]No, no, no, no.
[27:38.33]We gotta move on.
[27:39.13]There'll be other opportunities to be a fucking dumb asshole.
[27:42.29]Don't worry.
[27:52.59]Okay, let's go.
[27:57.88]Those guys don't do anything.
[27:58.90]It doesn't matter if they see you.
[28:07.21]Hold a melee or vault.
[28:09.77]Quick, behind that rock.
[28:11.67]I have a bad feeling about this.
[28:13.41]Bad feeling, huh?
[28:15.41]Can we make it out of the tutorial?
[28:16.51]What do you guys think?
[28:18.81]Wolves.
[28:20.15]Told you I had a bad feeling.
[28:21.95]Believe me now?
[28:22.97]You were right this time.
[28:24.71]Looks like they're busy chewing down something.
[28:26.73]No need to kill them until you really have to.
[28:29.43]Let's go through the bushes.
[28:31.04]Okay, go.
[28:32.80]I gotta get this guy fucking eaten.
[28:34.16]I have to.
[28:34.80]They could attack us.
[28:36.16]Don't think so.
[28:37.12]They're focused on the carrion.
[28:38.70]Right.
[28:39.02]Alright, we're safe.
[28:47.30]Follow me.
[28:55.48]You did it, man.
[28:56.08]Nice work.
[28:56.52]You got rid of those wolves.
[28:59.32]Wound him first.
[29:02.38]I'm having way too much fun right now.
[29:03.74]I really am.
[29:04.18]I'm sorry.
[29:04.64]I found some footprints.
[29:07.18]They look fresh.
[29:08.40]Whoever left those can't be far away.
[29:10.58]Analyze the footprints.
[29:12.08]You're the tracker in this family.
[29:13.59]What can you tell?
[29:15.91]Military boots.
[29:17.41]Two men.
[29:18.69]Must be soldiers.
[29:20.13]Army?
[29:20.69]Mercenaries?
[29:21.59]Scouts?
[29:22.66]Judging by their pattern, they're organized.
[29:25.46]I was gonna just shoot him in the head again.
[29:26.66]They were carrying some heavy shit.
[29:28.40]You mean weapons?
[29:29.22]Yeah.
[29:29.58]That's a safe bet.
[29:31.02]We should be ready for the worst.
[29:33.56]Guess it's time for us to get to work.
[29:35.55]Stay frosty.
[29:36.87]Don't get carried away.
[29:37.77]Yep, those are footprints.
[29:39.93]They were human beings over here at some point.
[29:42.13]I have eyes on the test site.
[29:43.69]Two mercenaries in there.
[29:44.81]Two mercenaries.
[29:45.37]We're gonna take them by surprise.
[29:46.76]I'll take that fucker at the edge and you focus on the one by the fire.
[29:50.12]Let's go.
[29:55.29]Here take it what is it take the body here take it okay?
[29:59.22]Oh?
[30:24.74]I thought he got up for a second.
[30:29.98]What does he want me to take?
[30:31.18]Take the drone?
[30:31.86]What?
[30:34.26]Time for the recon.
[30:34.92]Okay, teach me how to use the drone.
[30:38.77]Press T to use the drone.
[30:59.55]okay yes use space c to move up and down hold shift to increase the speed you can modify the drone okay you guys knew I was gonna do that right
[31:35.34]I mean, is this gonna kill him or not?
[31:38.66]Flying between his legs?
[31:39.74]Ah, this is not gonna work.
[31:46.83]Don't worry.
[31:48.11]Can't kill him with a drone.
[31:49.67]Not gonna happen.
[31:53.77]He would be dead.
[31:54.53]Crash into yourself.
[31:55.47]Let's see if it hurts me.
[32:00.72]No.
[32:02.18]It's alright.
[32:02.68]Whatever.
[32:04.00]We tried.
[32:07.11]Hover right in front of his face.
[32:08.75]I can do that.
[32:18.88]What?
[32:21.06]Did I just hit his binoculars?
[32:24.86]I did.
[32:26.06]I ran into his binoculars.
[32:29.74]Are you serious?
[32:36.06]How am I not pissing him off with this?
[32:39.56]Alright, let's go.
[32:40.22]I'm done.
[32:40.60]Okay, cool.
[32:47.48]Let's go.
[32:49.06]Tag enemies.
[32:49.90]How do I tag?
[32:55.07]Move down.
[32:55.71]You just have to be in sight.
[32:59.19]Got it.
[33:02.21]Tag him.
[33:02.89]Tag him.
[33:04.84]Yeah, found him.
[33:07.93]Found these guys, too.
[33:09.03]There's only a few more, I think, sir.
[33:18.12]Found him.
[33:21.00]Anybody on the roof?
[33:23.28]He's fucking serious, dude.
[33:33.92]Did you fail the mission?
[33:35.74]Do the funny shoot your teammate in the face joke.
[33:38.86]Oh, come on.
[33:39.18]All the way back here.
[33:39.84]Give me a break.
[33:40.90]Wait, you can... Okay, that's a stealth kill.
[33:42.42]I'm gonna go for a stealth kill here, then.
[34:01.06]So he's shooting the guy.
[34:02.74]I have to kill the guy by the fire.
[34:05.02]I do not hear that.
[34:23.73]Nice work.
[34:24.23]That was pretty cool, actually.
[34:25.81]That was really cool.
[34:26.71]I liked it.
[34:27.21]Just jump on top of him.
[34:34.91]Do the drone.
[34:35.59]Alright, let's do this for real.
[34:38.40]That was terrible.

[35:09.39]Got the first one.
[35:18.91]There's that guy on the roof.
[35:33.30]Another one.
[35:36.48]Two guys there.
[35:37.34]Three, there we go, okay.
[35:43.70]God damn it.
[35:46.60]Fucking stupid thing.
[35:48.98]I'm okay, we're good.
[35:52.65]Okay, we're good.
[36:05.99]I completed it.
[36:07.21]Oh, that was quick.
[36:12.28]Nice.
[36:12.72]Okay.
[36:12.98]Alright, let's take him out.
[36:17.60]Supported stance.
[36:20.26]Use supported stance for his weapon sway.
[36:24.78]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:25.37]Attaching the bipod increases the effectiveness.
[36:30.31]Cool.
[36:32.05]Got it.
[36:38.40]So, how do I... To enter supported stanchion, approach an obstacle and crouch.
[36:44.70]Okay.
[36:45.06]Remember, John, quiet.
[36:46.72]We need to take... To scope view, use yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:51.29]Check the target distance above your scope and use E and Q to adjust elevation.
[36:55.73]Wind indicator.
[36:57.65]Wind slow time.
[36:58.67]One by one before they realize we're here.
[37:00.85]Let's concentrate, old boy.
[37:02.80]First target, up on the roof, 270 meters.
[37:14.28]250 meters Got it the 250 meters away we got 9 milliseconds on our ping Got the helmet on, gotta get rid of him first.
[37:33.08]Nice headshot, got him.
[37:35.06]Wrong!
[37:35.54]What the fuck?
[37:40.90]That's not going to make me go all the way back to the drone, is it?
[37:43.46]I better not.
[37:49.15]Thank God.
[37:50.75]He said roof.
[37:51.57]I was just testing how to shoot the gun.
[37:53.05]I was testing how to shoot the gun.
[37:56.35]Now I know how to shoot the gun.
[37:58.71]Remember, John, quiet.
[38:00.37]We need to take them one by one.
[38:01.65]Let's concentrate, old boy.
[38:03.80]First target, up on the roof, 270 meters.
[38:16.43]I'll get them both.
[38:25.33]Got him.
[38:26.21]Missed!
[38:26.55]What do you mean missed?
[38:30.20]I know I have to shoot the roof.
[38:31.46]I'm trying to kill these two guys.
[38:35.24]I know I have to shoot the roof.
[38:38.76]You want to play by the game's rules?
[38:40.22]Fine.
[38:41.97]I know I have to shoot the roof.
[38:43.25]I've known that the whole fucking time.
[38:44.89]Stupid game.
[38:45.85]So linear.
[38:46.73]Is he talking about like this guy?
[38:48.11]Is this guy like smoking a cigarette?
[38:51.85]No, he's talking about this guy.
[39:17.15]Okay, here we go.
[39:18.70]He's dead.
[39:19.46]Down.
[39:20.38]Here's this guy.
[39:21.38]See you later.
[39:21.96]And then here's these two.
[39:23.60]Wait for the opportunity.
[39:27.84]I already have an opportunity.
[39:29.40]It's called shoot them both.
[39:31.01]Got it.
[39:47.76]What happened to the other guy?
[39:50.86]What happened?
[39:51.58]Single shot.
[39:54.50]You got it.
[39:54.73]I can do that.
[40:17.74]Got him.
[40:22.51]What happened to the guy that was... What happened to the other guy?
[40:30.41]Wasn't there a guy that was walking away over here?
[40:32.03]He just doesn't care?
[40:33.41]Oh, he's up on the gadget wheel.
[40:47.02]Okay.
[40:47.26]What the hell?
[40:48.10]Is this a rock?
[40:49.78]And there's rocks, too.
[40:52.87]Thank God.
[40:53.39]I mean, you gotta take it.
[41:05.94]Like, enough rocks in this guy's head and he's gonna fall backwards, right?
[41:11.84]Enough rocks at this guy's head and it will work.
[41:14.74]It's doing, like, eight damage a hit.
[41:28.20]Alright, I don't know if it's gonna work.
[41:38.51]We're gonna get this at like 30 more seconds.
[41:47.81]He's dodging.
[42:00.76]One.
[42:02.14]Two.
[42:03.67]Three.
[42:05.07]Four.
[42:06.35]Five.
[42:07.69]Six.
[42:08.99]Seven.
[42:10.39]Eight.
[42:11.69]Eight.
[42:12.93]Nine.
[42:14.15]Ten.
[42:19.90]Shit, those are explosive.
[42:21.68]Wait, now that I injured him.
[42:32.02]Alright, fine.
[42:41.25]Come on.
[42:52.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:58.16]I'm down.

[43:08.81]Doing a piece about this local warmonger.
[43:11.05]Yeah, I heard about it.
[43:12.75]Special Forces is discussing bombing that motherfucker.
[43:15.65]You worried?
[43:16.25]He's like doctoring these rocks.
[43:17.41]She's tough as nails.
[43:18.70]She only looks fragile.
[43:25.85]He might know something.
[43:27.07]E. E!
[43:48.75]E!
[43:48.97]CHAT CHAT!
[44:03.82]God dammit, fuck.
[44:05.39]I forgot I had the... I forgot I had the explosive rounds on.
[44:09.25]Alright, take over the explosive rounds.
[44:11.75]How do we know we're here?
[44:12.69]I don't know.
[44:13.17]She's tough as nails.
[44:13.69]She only looks fragile.
[44:33.88]A vehicle incoming.
[44:35.04]I see the driver inside.
[44:36.78]Ah, leave it to me.
[44:38.20]Wait, he might know something.
[44:39.86]Wait.
[44:42.32]Wow, quickly he approached.
[44:48.46]Oh, God.
[44:52.98]Okay.
[44:55.54]That was fucking quickly.
[45:02.42]Bro.
[45:02.90]I'm on the spot.
[45:09.18]No, we didn't.
[45:09.98]They were supposed to wait for me in here.
[45:12.61]Okay, we'll check that out.
[45:22.23]He wasn't paying attention to the stones, guys.
[45:24.39]The fucking game told me to do that.
[45:26.17]It didn't work.
[45:27.05]Same here.
[45:28.95]So where's your wife these days?
[45:30.63]Iraq?
[45:31.45]Turkey?
[45:32.29]Mila?
[45:32.63]She's in the Congo.
[45:33.73]I tried.
[45:34.17]Doing a piece about this local warmonger.
[45:36.55]I heard about it.
[45:38.11]Special forces is discussing bombing them.
[45:40.33]He didn't care.
[45:41.25]Worried?
[45:41.61]Nah.
[45:42.74]She's tough as nails.
[45:44.06]She only looks fragile.
[45:45.46]Follow me, brother.
[45:46.52]This isn't a rock shower.
[45:48.06]Alright, let's just do it.
[45:49.38]Okay, here we go.
[45:50.22]Leave it to me.
[45:51.20]Wait.
[45:51.92]He might know something.
[45:53.52]Yeah, yeah.
[45:53.98]Okay.
[45:54.38]Use the real... Lord, throw rocks.
[45:56.79]If the guy's on the fucking phone, he doesn't care.
[46:01.51]Lure him away with rocks.
[46:04.10]Except he's so busy on his cell phone, he doesn't give a fuck.
[46:06.78]Is he dead?
[46:08.04]He's dead.
[46:30.26]Stay focused, Rob.
[46:31.32]Okay.
[46:31.60]That guy died from being punched.
[46:32.72]Alright, alright.
[46:38.79]We're coming in.
[46:39.71]Copy.
[46:39.97]How do we know what he said was real?
[46:41.05]This place used to serve as a biological weapons test area.
[46:43.83]You have to blow that whole shit up.
[46:45.67]Roger.
[46:46.21]Got it.
[46:46.47]Blow it up.
[46:46.93]Got it.
[46:47.97]Intruder detected.
[46:48.93]There's a guy in a toilet.
[46:49.73]I thought that was a person.
[46:50.95]I thought that was a person in a toilet.
[46:53.33]See the right?
[46:53.71]I thought that was like guys sitting on the can.
[46:56.09]I thought that was the indicator.
[46:57.53]I was like, oh shit, there's a guy in a bathroom over here.
[46:59.35]No, it's this.
[47:13.58]It was a security toilet.
[47:17.34]What does it even want me to do?
[47:18.17]Am I going through the car wash?
[47:36.19]Come on, move on.
[47:38.99]Are you going to go in first?
[47:41.32]Alright, you go first.
[47:43.74]Does he want us to get in the tank?
[47:46.96]John?
[47:47.70]What?
[47:48.30]Mila's still... Come on.
[47:50.24]Watch me, brother.
[47:51.55]Yeah, yeah.
[47:52.41]Show me what you got.
[47:53.99]That is so stupid.
[47:55.03]Any time.
[47:56.15]Yeah.
[47:57.13]There's another guy in here.
[47:58.93]What about you, John?
[48:00.45]Wasn't there anyone in Afghanistan?
[48:02.37]What about her?
[48:03.51]Leah was her name?
[48:04.95]Lydia.
[48:05.71]So why didn't you two leave it?
[48:07.91]OK, then forget I asked.
[48:15.02]Going up here.
[48:18.20]Apparently.
[48:28.40]Why is he being so tactical?
[48:29.50]He already killed everybody.
[48:31.16]There's one person we didn't kill and I don't know where he is.
[48:36.68]Use the CCTV.
[48:38.30]We're gonna beat him at their own game.
[48:41.84]Why did he do that?
[48:47.00]I'm stuck in here.
[48:48.49]I can't move.
[48:51.01]I'm still in a falling animation.
[49:02.85]Alright, we're good.
[49:06.41]I just have to take another gun out from my feet to land.
[49:08.35]The game's getting sick of my shit.
[49:17.89]Back to Wally.
[49:18.79]Alright, what does it want to do?
[49:21.55]Take out the security toilet.
[49:23.03]You got it.
[49:29.83]I replaced this green iPad with my green iPad.
[49:34.77]What?
[49:36.11]Let me tag all the enemies.
[49:39.27]There's nobody in here.
[49:40.11]Oh, there's one guy right there.
[49:41.23]Oh, there's two guys there.
[49:48.30]Okay.
[50:02.48]Right.
[50:03.14]That's the entrance to the landfill.
[50:05.02]Our target must be somewhere nearby, John.
[50:07.63]Let's move.
[50:12.85]Got him.
[50:16.91]Come on, Frank.
[50:17.55]Do something.
[50:21.08]Do you think that's going to be effective, Robert?
[50:25.34]Yeah, you just shot in the air.
[50:27.00]I just want to make sure you understand that.
[50:28.14]You just shot your gun into the air.
[50:32.56]Not the best tactic in the world.
[50:33.68]You just had a clear shot.
[50:35.18]Shoot.
[50:35.62]Shoot now.
[50:36.60]No, they're not over on the right.
[50:38.70]Shoot.
[50:40.02]Shoot down.
[50:41.58]Shoot down.
[50:42.02]No, don't shoot.
[50:43.86]Don't shoot me.
[50:44.52]Don't shoot over at me.
[50:46.45]That would be great if you didn't shoot me.
[50:50.31]You'll get it right eventually.
[50:52.15]Maybe you won't.
[51:14.58]I love this.
[51:15.86]I love it.
[51:17.38]There's a guy right here.
[51:18.26]Where is he?
[51:18.70]Right there.
[51:19.14]This dude's fucked.
[51:28.95]This guy Robert is special forces.
[51:30.49]I don't know how to do it.
[51:32.31]I don't know how to do it.
[51:34.19]I don't know how to do it.
[51:35.45]Did he just do it?
[51:43.16]Covering the door.
[51:44.38]Hurry up, John.
[51:45.68]Hurry up.
[51:47.82]Mercenaries, open fire.
[51:50.64]There.
[51:53.28]What is he doing?
[51:57.58]Dead.
[51:57.80]Target down.
[51:58.52]Next.
[52:02.26]I want him to shoot me right in the fucking head.
[52:05.20]Just shoot me in the head.
[52:09.57]You know you want to.
[52:14.64]Nobody shot him.
[52:15.54]I think that guy shot himself.
[52:16.98]I don't think he shot him.
[52:21.60]I don't think that guy actually got shot.
[52:28.00]A cutscene.
[52:28.72]What?
[52:28.86]What a twist.
[52:41.73]See, and, okay, we're both dead now.
[52:44.41]I did that to a guy and he died.
[52:46.83]Here comes the guy in the suit.
[52:47.63]You know, Mr. North, I believe the best of us are also lucky.
[52:55.05]I'm a guy in a suit.
[52:56.75]One.
[52:57.87]Two.
[53:04.84]He shot twice!
[53:06.84]That's not fair!
[53:07.50]That's not fair!
[53:08.08]He shot twice!
[53:12.57]That's not fair.
[53:18.91]Let me tell you something about John Wick.
[53:23.47]Do you think that you can kill John Wick?
[53:27.19]Enough.
[53:27.55]Like, seriously, how many times are you going to kick me in the fucking head?
[53:30.45]I would probably die from that.
[53:38.50]John Wick.
[53:43.67]Harvey, two shots.
[53:46.41]Hey, thanks to that random guy for the bits.
[53:49.27]It's the time server.
[53:50.27]I almost read your copy, Pasta, but thanks for the bits.
[53:52.90]Dr. Fudge, thanks for $10.
[53:54.90]Jerma Robert is the bad guy.
[53:56.28]Destroy him for the good of the world.
[53:57.92]I think that was a huge spoiler.
[53:59.52]$10 spoiler there from Dr. Fudge.
[54:01.18]Thanks a lot, dude.
[54:02.66]Also, thank you to Danger Illustrated for the bits.
[54:05.28]I really want to watch you play the Uncharted games after watching this climbing shenanigans.
[54:13.95]Shall we?
[54:18.45]What was the point of that cutscene?
[54:19.27]The point of that cutscene was to introduce the main villain of the game.
[54:25.85]Here we are.
[54:26.77]Now we're gonna be in prison.
[54:28.58]Oh, wait, wait, wait, we gotta, we gotta... The art of war is simple enough.
[54:31.58]Find out where your enemy is, get at him as soon as you can, strike him as hard as you can, and keep moving on.
[54:37.38]From Ulysses S. Grant.
[54:37.98]Sure.
[54:38.22]Sure.
[54:42.43]Northeastern Georgia, present time.
[54:47.03]Oh, you give me a car.
[54:51.13]Don't you give me a car.
[54:52.31]That was a fucking mistake, game.
[54:56.43]They gave me a car.
[54:58.00]I get a car.
[55:01.98]They gave me a car and you get old ladies in the road?
[55:10.26]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose my mind with this music.
[55:12.16]Loadstar.
[55:16.43]Come in, Loadstar.
[55:17.69]This is Whiskey, Foxtrot Sierra.
[55:20.05]What?
[55:20.55]Frank?
[55:21.13]You're on this line?
[55:22.29]Making sure you don't go off reservation.
[55:24.33]Hey, I'm fine in here.
[55:25.55]I'm just doing my job.
[55:27.03]This got so much better.
[55:28.27]Who doesn't like this game?
[55:29.72]How dare you?
[55:30.80]How dare you not like this game?
[55:32.20]Wait a minute.
[55:33.46]Where am I going?
[55:35.08]So where are we?
[55:36.26]HQ didn't brief you?
[55:37.78]Yeah.
[55:39.39]but I want to hear it from you.
[55:41.13]Okay, Whiskey Foxtrot Sierra, sir.
[55:44.22]Big uptick in separatist activity in this part of Georgia.
[55:47.26]Situation very unstable.
[55:48.74]HQ is right about that.
[55:50.62]These guys are better trained and have more sophisticated arms than we usually see in this kind of operation.
[55:55.58]It's building something big.
[55:56.80]Whoever's leading them is one kick-ass motherfucker.
[56:00.34]Oh, did I mention crazy smart and feared like a god?
[56:04.06]So we need to sow a little good old-fashioned disruption and chaos in amongst these troublemakers.
[56:10.06]Hold on, this is important.
[56:36.19]Oh, god damn it.
[56:37.99]I gotta call- Can I get in the fucking John Deere?
[56:41.27]If I- Can I get in the John Deere?
[56:42.47]Please.
[56:43.57]Please let me ride the John Deere around.
[56:46.78]God damn it.
[56:49.48]I can't ride around in the John Deere.
[56:51.76]That's unfortunate.
[56:59.78]What's- I don't even have a- Do I have a mission?
[57:05.51]You can't just walk over that.
[57:07.05]Is there a person in here?
[57:16.98]God damn it.
[57:26.69]Yeah.
[57:41.86]Vehicle locked?
[57:44.58]Why is the vehicle locked?
[57:46.13]Open it!
[58:09.78]Alright, let's start.
[58:11.20]Let's do this again.
[58:11.96]Let's do this again.
[58:15.12]What's happening?
[58:15.60]I think that, like, it was praying, but...
[58:40.38]Are you just gonna look at me or what?
[58:41.59]God damn it, dude.
[59:02.36]That fucking... My whole body hurts.
[59:05.42]Oh, what the fuck?
[59:06.82]Please.
[59:15.17]Do I have a dash cam?
[59:17.57]I don't know, man.
[59:18.51]Okay, let's play.
[59:20.79]Let's play this game.
[59:22.79]No more running over any old ladies.
[59:25.28]Play the game.
[59:27.34]No, this game got so much better.
[59:28.64]This game is not bad.
[59:29.80]Everyone told me this game was so bad.
[59:32.76]You didn't tell me you could, like, do this shit.
[59:38.93]Wait, wait a minute.
[59:39.83]Wait a minute.
[59:41.23]Wait a second.
[59:42.31]Everybody stop.
[59:44.40]Everybody stop.
[59:45.98]Stop.
[59:47.40]Wait.
[59:50.26]Wait.
[59:51.06]Just wait.
[59:59.45]North, this is JSOC headquarters.
[60:01.57]In port.
[60:02.17]We're sending you coordinates to the nearest safe house.
[60:04.73]There you'll find equipment and mission information.
[60:06.97]Good luck, Marine.
[60:08.18]JSOC over and out.
[60:15.22]God damn it!
[60:15.84]It needs to go faster!
[60:22.17]I don't wanna like roll out of the car.
[60:23.59]I wanna just like move it really slowly.
[60:36.05]He takes so long to roll.
[60:42.32]Fuck, I didn't mean to do that.
[60:43.36]Oh well.
[60:43.66]Let's run our head over and just move on.
[60:48.36]Toggle lights.
[60:58.25]This person's running.
[61:06.59]No, don't run towards me.
[61:07.67]Are you stupid?
[61:23.47]Alright, I've got it out of my system.
[61:24.93]We can go.
[61:25.35]A gas station?
[61:42.37]What can I do in the gas station?
[61:46.17]Can I get out of here?
[61:51.97]I don't think I'm supposed to have my car here.
[61:54.63]Oh, shit!
[62:05.33]Oh, goddammit.
[62:11.46]Can I fix the car?
[62:24.44]Call AAA.
[62:26.28]Who put that there?
[62:27.10]Who put that at the gas station?
[62:29.44]Press K. What does K do?
[62:37.60]North, this is JSOC headquarters.
[62:40.30]We're sending you coordinates to the nearest safe house.
[62:42.84]There you'll find equipment and mission information.
[62:45.10]Good luck, Marine.
[62:46.24]JSOC over and out.
[62:52.61]Please, God, help us.
[63:00.21]I'm just checking.
[63:00.85]I'm just checking.
[63:02.45]I'm just checking.
[63:04.41]Welcome, welcome.
[63:06.19]What do you need?
[63:07.24]The rock's really far.
[63:15.24]I've seen if pedestrians have less health.
[63:21.69]Alright, that's it.
[63:23.59]Oh, come on, he's got a fruit stand.
[63:26.25]I was hoping the fruit stand was gonna fall too, but it's alright.
[63:35.14]And there's a train too.
[63:36.14]God, there's a lot of shit to explore.
[63:40.88]Let's get to the safe house first, then I have to investigate the train.
[63:44.33]It's really important.
[63:52.50]No side missions.
[63:53.66]We're not doing that right now.
[63:57.09]Just stay on the road.
[63:57.93]There's the gas station.
[64:01.27]Okay, I already know.
[64:07.98]You can't, like... What about, like, one of their cars?
[64:25.52]You can't, like, stealth kill pedestrians, unfortunately.
[64:29.42]Unfortunately?
[64:30.18]What a psycho.
[64:32.26]Why do I, like, want to kill, like, these people?
[64:35.00]They didn't do anything.
[64:45.39]Oh!
[65:03.91]Can I loot this?
[65:05.65]I just wanted to see if it was possible.
[65:06.85]That's all I did.
[65:07.49]That's just a joke.
[65:08.89]I wanted to see if that was possible, you monster.
[65:13.09]No, loot them for the car keys?
[65:15.50]No, I don't need their car keys.
[65:16.70]I need this.
[65:28.83]Alright.
[65:29.61]This is to get to the safe house.
[65:30.69]Does not... I'm like a... I am... This is a horror movie.
[65:36.63]Just get in the well.
[65:40.51]Get in the well.
[65:41.61]Get in the well.
[65:43.41]Get in the well.
[65:44.91]You know he's gonna fall in that well.
[65:46.47]It's possible.
[65:47.99]God damn it.
[65:48.60]He could fall in that well.
[65:50.90]Fuck it.
[65:55.92]Another car?
[65:57.90]Give me that car.
[66:05.53]Okay, I can't.
[66:13.62]I can't.
[66:14.18]God damn it.
[66:14.82]I'm sorry.
[66:15.48]I'm sorry.
[66:23.62]Get out of here.
[66:25.00]You can't give me freedom in a game, guys.
[66:27.02]If you give me freedom in a game... Move.
[66:32.80]See?
[66:33.06]You can't give me freedom.
[66:41.59]Otherwise, I'm going to do this shit.
[66:45.13]Get him.
[66:45.89]No!
[66:46.17]No!
[66:52.55]Safehouse.
[66:56.73]This vehicle is the greatest thing ever, by the way.
[66:59.91]I love this.
[67:00.95]Where's the safehouse?
[67:01.83]Alright, I think the safehouse is right underneath me.
[67:09.30]Yeah, it's right there.
[67:15.90]Just like in GTA!
[67:20.37]There we go, I just gotta get it situated, that's all.
[67:34.66]Alright, this bucket of bolts has got me through more than this.
[67:42.78]Used to drive this thing to work on two wheels.
[67:45.48]Can you believe it?
[67:52.86]Found the safe house.
[67:59.79]Alright.
[68:02.25]Hey, look at that.
[68:03.43]Safe house.
[68:08.17]You've entered a secure location where you can rest, equip, and craft your items, plan your operations.
[68:12.99]Cool.
[68:13.37]Okay.
[68:15.95]The safe house.
[68:18.54]Weapon cache.
[68:20.26]Sure.
[68:20.70]Let's take a look.
[68:21.54]Let's open this bad Larry.
[68:26.68]Yeah.
[68:27.12]Knife, please.
[68:31.49]Yeah.
[68:32.15]How do I take the knife?
[68:38.49]Yeah.
[68:40.23]I only have... Okay.
[68:41.25]Compound bow.
[68:42.11]Yep.
[68:48.06]How much money do I have?
[68:53.78]Barbed head arrow.
[68:56.00]Thank you.
[68:56.34]Let's get some more arrows.
[69:05.75]30 arrows.
[69:07.55]We're using this.
[69:08.17]I don't fucking... You guys think I'm... Are you serious?
[69:11.34]The Macmillan or the XM?
[69:15.57]Definitely this one, yeah.
[69:17.71]Some regular bolts.
[69:23.96]Let's get like fucking 45 rounds.
[69:25.76]50 rounds.
[69:27.38]No, that's too much.
[69:27.98]40.
[69:28.38]Okay, that's good.
[69:33.43]Got the knife.
[69:35.83]Let's get a couple of med kits.
[69:38.19]Pills is fine, sure.
[69:41.80]What gadgets?
[69:42.87]Smoke grenade, frag grenade.
[69:44.57]I will take nine of them.
[69:48.95]As many as I can possibly fucking hold.
[69:52.45]And I want smoke grenades too.
[70:01.18]Just give me all of them.
[70:04.10]Did I run out of money?
[70:04.72]What the fuck's going on?
[70:14.26]What the fuck?
[70:14.66]What is happening?
[70:15.36]Am I crazy or can I only hold... Okay, there we go.
[70:21.74]Repair kit.
[70:22.86]Sure, give me one.
[70:24.42]Useless.
[70:26.38]Armor.
[70:26.82]I don't know.
[70:27.36]Drone.
[70:28.74]Okay.
[70:30.91]Good.
[70:32.21]I think we're good.
[70:32.75]This is my compound bow.
[70:41.65]Perfect.
[70:44.14]Go to the workbench.
[70:45.84]Crafting ammo.
[70:49.02]There's too many sound effects for one menu.
[70:50.60]You know, I agree.
[70:54.77]I want some more of these.
[71:00.73]Okay.
[71:02.71]Whatever.
[71:03.07]Now I can craft ammo and shit.
[71:05.12]I just use an eraser to do that.
[71:06.58]Okay, let's go.
[71:10.72]Perfect.
[71:12.60]Sleep to heal.
[71:16.15]This dirty bed.
[71:17.05]I'm going to sleep for 24 hours.
[71:27.14]That's a long time.
[71:30.66]Let's do it again.
[71:31.26]I need to catch up on some sleep.
[71:38.00]Why don't we sleep for a third day in a row?
[71:45.16]Okay, let's wake up.
[71:48.04]Three days have gone by.
[71:52.65]Laptop.
[71:53.15]You can select missions.
[71:57.53]Okay, we've got two birds.
[72:00.89]We've got to kill a skeleton at the gas station.
[72:02.57]We've got to go to the gas station.
[72:03.57]Let's start this mission.
[72:06.23]I'm sorry.
[72:07.75]I like this game.
[72:10.08]Hold on, did you guys say that this game was worse than Sniper Elite?
[72:12.10]How?
[72:12.20]This is such an awful combination of Far Cry and Sniper Elite.
[72:14.46]It's a perfect dumb, dead combination.
[72:16.04]Copy that, except that I've killed like 30 civilians.
[72:41.12]Yeah, don't kill civilians.
[72:42.68]Me too.
[72:43.18]Roger that.
[72:43.48]Yep.
[72:43.62]Okay, so let's get situated here.
[73:13.44]You're almost there.
[73:14.24]I've marked a suitable sniping spot on your GPS.
[73:17.46]There's the car.
[73:18.10]Alright.
[73:18.86]Suitable sniping spot.
[73:20.84]God damn it.
[73:21.36]What?
[73:33.89]Where's this guy?
[73:40.36]Okay, I gave that guy indigestion.
[73:42.16]Good.
[74:00.53]I wanna bring my car up there.
[74:07.24]Taco Bell bullets!
[74:11.58]There's a good sniping spot up there.
[74:21.67]Tell me I can't jump this car up there.
[74:24.81]Definitely can, but it's alright.
[74:29.62]We'll just do the parkour.
[74:42.94]Alright, sniper ghost warrior.
[74:45.28]Sniper ghost wolf.
[74:47.80]Can you... Can you get up there, please?
[74:53.85]What?
[74:54.95]What the fuck was that?
[74:58.07]I fell so far.
[74:59.01]Shh!
[75:02.15]Shh!
[75:13.21]That was some Ninja Warrior shit, it was.
[75:14.85]Okay, here we go.
[75:17.91]I'm at the roost.
[75:19.91]Don't slide off!
[75:23.83]Hold E to wait for target.
[75:26.72]I'm on site.
[75:27.96]Copy.
[75:29.10]Get comfy.
[75:30.32]I'll keep you informed.
[75:31.70]I'm just blowing up... No, don't do a cutscene.
[75:33.28]You're gonna take me out of this.
[75:34.76]Okay, get ready.
[75:36.40]You've got some time before the target arrives.
[75:38.64]Use your scopes to scout the area.
[75:42.66]We may have an issue here.
[75:43.76]I just held down F. There's a slight issue here.
[75:51.83]I'm holding F down right now.
[75:59.03]It's okay.
[75:59.37]They're not here yet.
[76:01.71]They didn't see... They didn't see that, apparently.
[76:06.05]The guy throwing grenades.
[76:11.28]So where's the target?
[76:11.94]Devin, blind.
[76:12.56]Where's the helicopter?
[76:15.14]Where's the heli-
[76:40.67]How have I not done it?
[76:44.65]How is he still alive?
[76:45.75]I hit him right in the face!
[76:47.29]Okay, he's dead.
[76:57.92]He's dead, right?
[77:00.24]That guy's dead.
[77:10.10]Did I win?
[77:10.62]Did I win the mission?
[77:12.88]Explosion nearby!
[77:17.57]You fucked up.
[77:18.79]Try to stay alive, will ya?
[77:19.93]The target's gonna be here in a while.
[77:21.97]Wait, that wasn't the target?
[77:25.47]That wasn't the target.
[77:28.03]Are you shitting me?
[77:29.87]What was that then?
[77:30.82]What was that for?
[77:38.45]I thought the guy was coming in on... I thought he was coming in on like fucking the helicopter detail.
[77:46.01]Well, whatever.
[77:46.51]This is fucking easy.
[77:48.26]I win!
[77:48.72]Okay, we can go home.
[77:55.80]Wait, there's two targets?
[77:57.18]Who's the other target?
[78:01.22]Okay, I win.
[78:02.92]Good job, everybody.
[78:05.54]All targets dead.
[78:18.38]Oh shit, ow, ow!
[78:20.60]Alright, time to go.
[78:31.03]I win, I win.
[78:33.51]Like, just give me my car.
[78:34.51]Where's my car?
[78:36.49]It's like over here, right?
[78:40.97]What?
[78:42.21]Oh shit!
[78:45.01]We're off!
[78:48.95]What?
[78:50.53]They're shooting mortars?
[78:52.77]You guys are fucking desperate.
[79:02.58]Alright, where did my car go?
[79:18.26]I want the bow.
[79:23.48]I want Hay's car, actually.
[79:36.08]I don't have any, like... Where does it go?
[79:38.83]Does it drop?
[79:42.71]There's the car.
[79:43.17]Good.
[79:50.27]I'm gonna make a fucking grand exit.
[80:00.24]Just gotta exfiltrate.
[80:02.16]And we win.
[80:09.22]What?
[80:10.32]What?
[80:12.20]What?
[80:13.49]What happened?
[80:26.20]I got dragged up the mountain.
[80:27.78]That's what happened.
[80:29.86]This car's acting really funny.
[80:32.58]I win.
[80:39.31]Thank you, Duke Nukem for the bits.
[80:40.61]Also, a whole of one zombie for the 15 bucks.
[80:43.77]It's worth it.
[80:45.71]Thank you.
[80:48.67]Okay.
[80:49.03]Okay.
[80:54.76]Ooh, I got a skill tree!
[80:57.74]Skill tree!
[80:59.58]Jerma's got a skill tree!
[81:01.44]What the fuck am I doing?
[81:02.24]Calm down.
[81:04.64]Sniper, ghost, or warrior.
[81:07.76]This is like crafting.
[81:09.97]Carry another magazine.
[81:11.05]Faster reload.
[81:13.37]Better prices.
[81:14.71]More slots.
[81:17.23]Okay, what about the other stuff?
[81:18.93]Less damage.
[81:28.05]Unlimited chain kills in melee.
[81:33.93]50% more loot.
[81:36.98]Okay, I kind of reload your rifle faster.
[81:44.32]I mean, we're going to have to get serial killer, right?
[81:54.73]Yeah.
[81:55.61]I want serial killer eventually.
[81:58.99]We'll just take this one.
[82:00.37]Who cares?
[82:03.09]Clean sight line.
[82:04.59]Good job.
[82:05.79]Eyes like a hawk.
[82:06.91]Thanks.
[82:07.21]I think I should earn a little leeway.
[82:09.85]Intel reports a couple of sightings of Robert.
[82:11.62]That was his fault.
[82:12.14]He was standing in the road.
[82:13.04]He's my brother.
[82:13.82]Request denied, soldier.
[82:16.24]He's not in our deck at all.
[82:17.20]Wait, that was my brother?
[82:18.12]I know.
[82:18.82]Can you run over the chicken?
[82:20.34]Yeah.
[82:22.06]The chicken gave me that much resistance.
[82:23.92]You've got
[82:26.14]We've got a ghost presence in the safe house.
[82:28.32]Movement detectors are throwing up shadows.
[82:30.38]How many?
[82:31.36]Could be three or four.
[82:32.72]An ambush?
[82:33.88]Or a raid?
[82:34.26]He was asking for it.
[82:35.10]He was.
[82:35.40]Could be that location is blown.
[82:37.19]Fuck.
[82:37.81]We've got a big weapons cache, maps, recent intel.
[82:41.05]Get over there.
[82:42.01]But be careful.
[82:43.71]Somebody's in my safe house right now?
[82:46.13]Never been afraid of ghosts.
[82:47.75]Out.
[82:47.95]I guess there's a person in my safe house.
[82:54.73]Use fast travel points on your map to quickly move between locations.
[82:58.82]Okay.
[83:07.99]Yeah.
[83:08.37]Alright, we're good.
[83:13.55]I'm afraid of the ghosts.
[83:15.57]Like the ghost blacker.
[83:19.21]I did this last time, and I'm an idiot.
[83:22.35]The safe house is right here.
[83:50.17]Long time no see.
[83:53.79]That's for the shit you pulled in Afghanistan.
[83:55.75]It was so pissed off.
[83:57.30]The game was so angry that it just was like, fuck this guy.
[83:59.58]I'm going to put him in here.
[84:00.98]I've been ordered to destabilize the separatist cells and neutralize their leadership.
[84:06.32]I won't lie.
[84:06.90]I need someone who knows the region.
[84:09.86]You better be fucking joking.
[84:11.80]I thought I made it clear.
[84:13.26]I look away for one second and I come back to you flying in the car.
[84:17.89]Fuck off, lady.
[84:20.91]Nobody cares.
[84:25.09]New emission from the laptop device.
[84:27.45]Okay, I think I'm actually going to continue to play this game.
[84:33.50]Let's do this grave one.
[84:39.18]Oh, that's Lydia.
[84:41.38]Remember her?
[84:46.05]She's somebody of... I guess somebody that... You know, whatever.
[84:52.46]total shit on the inside.
[84:54.34]But you are a badass killing machine, so maybe that's what it takes.
[84:58.95]So, let's get to it then.
[85:00.93]Thomas and David Sinamonitsis started to unify all the Separatist cells.
[85:05.25]As ever, when brutal ethnic cleansing starts, it brings haters together.
[85:09.90]There is an emerging Georgian resistance snapping away at the edges of the Separatist campaign.
[85:15.04]In short, sabotage.
[85:17.08]It's causing disruption.
[85:18.54]Not very strong, but with a lot of heart.
[85:20.76]What's key to bringing them over?
[85:22.68]A humanitarian mission.
[85:23.74]Happy that we're not allowed to play in Wall-E?
[85:24.90]Very happy.
[85:25.25]Civilians are being marched to an old cemetery.
[85:27.31]They're being executed by the separatists.
[85:28.79]I need to know what's over here, though.
[85:30.19]What is this?
[85:30.69]Resistance intel can help lead us to Thomas and David.
[85:33.81]It'll be my pleasure.
[85:35.37]Out.
[85:35.81]Be careful out there.
[85:43.80]How did that not kill me?
[85:48.78]Ooh, hooray.
[85:49.50]Good job.
[85:53.34]How did I not die from that?
[85:54.88]Well, I don't know.
[86:04.48]What is this?
[86:06.20]It wants me to check this out.
[86:08.04]What is it?
[86:08.32]Is this loot in here?
[86:10.76]Electronic parts.
[86:13.91]A dead person.
[86:16.57]Oh, wait, what's that?
[86:18.13]Trading goods.
[86:18.85]Point of interest cleared.
[86:22.68]Making sure there wasn't a zombie.
[86:23.56]I thought that was a zombie.
[86:24.28]I really did.
[86:24.64]There's no boat over here?
[86:26.22]Fuck.
[86:29.42]Can this thing go in the water?
[86:30.74]The water's not deep.
[86:31.78]It really isn't that deep at all.
[86:34.67]I'm going to assume it can be in water.
[86:36.45]It's like a subterranean vehicle, I would assume.
[86:38.45]That's what SUV stands for.
[86:40.09]Subterranean Urban Vehicle.
[86:43.71]Please let me drive this.
[86:45.23]Please let me drive this in the water.
[86:46.49]Please.
[87:07.81]Fuck.
[87:15.69]Ugh.
[87:20.70]Fish AI.
[87:24.10]I mean, I'll get another car.
[87:25.38]It's okay.
[87:34.10]This is a long way to go.
[87:39.56]Car?
[87:40.34]I see a van.
[87:42.16]Why did I think that was a good idea?
[87:44.66]I'm okay.
[87:49.67]I missed.
[87:50.95]Oh god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
[87:54.53]Shit!
[87:56.22]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[87:57.28]God damn it!
[87:58.20]Oh, perfect!
[87:59.30]Just pretend I was never here.
[88:00.52]Go back to what you were doing.
[88:07.02]Oh, just pretend I wasn't here.
[88:08.12]It's okay.
[88:09.46]I wasn't going to do anything.
[88:10.21]I know nothing.
[88:12.21]Don't kill me.
[88:14.01]He doesn't kill me?
[88:14.61]I don't want to fight.
[88:17.67]I have no weapon.
[88:18.73]Please.
[88:22.73]Car, come on.
[88:23.85]Damn it.
[88:29.61]None of these cars work.
[88:31.60]I'm unarmed.
[88:32.60]I'm unarmed.
[88:34.30]I know you're unarmed.
[88:38.08]Where are you all running to?
[88:43.54]I'm not going to.
[88:44.74]Stop running away!
[88:46.90]Where the hell are you going?
[88:48.10]You're running way too far away.
[88:49.60]Where do you think you're going to end up here?
[88:54.51]Away from me?
[89:00.19]Yeah, but like, just go back.
[89:02.07]I'm running this way.
[89:03.92]There's no reason for you to keep going this way.
[89:09.18]And now I'm gonna get like spotted by these people.
[89:17.95]Everyone's just running through this.
[89:19.77]Is this guy on my team?
[89:47.58]I'm unharmed, please!
[89:48.72]Oh, well.
[89:55.78]Okay, at least I have my car back, right?
[89:58.45]My car is okay.
[89:59.31]I got my car back.
[89:59.99]We don't have to do that again.
[90:05.27]See?
[90:05.59]The car is back!
[90:07.56]Yay!
[90:08.02]Yay!
[90:08.60]Yay!
[90:09.06]Gabby J!
[90:10.10]Yay!
[90:10.74]Yay!
[90:11.52]Yay!
[90:17.60]Get in the car, you fucking idiot.
[90:22.45]Yay!
[90:23.05]Yay!
[90:23.75]Yay!
[90:25.25]Gabby J!
[90:26.27]Yay!
[90:29.09]Whoa!
[90:29.49]Yay!
[90:32.32]Yay!
[90:37.09]Alright, let's go.
[90:38.73]No fucking around.
[90:44.67]There is like a... There's like a new... There's like a processor over here.
[90:51.04]Is the guy... Is the guy working under there?
[90:52.38]This is important.
[90:56.62]He is, right?
[90:57.40]Okay.
[91:02.52]Did I get him?
[91:07.56]No, I didn't.
[91:11.38]I was trying to move the car just a little.
[91:14.17]Can I beep?
[91:17.55]There.
[91:22.81]Alright, what is the... I mean, I gotta hit the guy with the bag of sand, right?
[91:34.31]Well, he doesn't have it anymore, so never mind.
[91:40.07]What is in here?
[91:45.41]Loot or something?
[91:46.03]Is there a box?
[91:47.41]I guess so.
[91:47.83]Are these guys going to be mad?
[91:48.85]Electronic parts.
[91:52.65]Okay.
[91:55.40]Okay.
[91:58.32]Is there a drill over here?
[92:13.53]I'm being such a creep right now.
[92:28.34]I don't think it matters.
[92:29.11]I'm getting distracted now.
[92:32.61]It's time to move.
[92:51.63]He doesn't care about that.
[92:53.27]I guess.
[92:53.79]Oh, come on.
[92:54.39]You don't care about that?
[92:55.27]Alright, fine.
[93:00.78]Fuck you.
[93:01.18]I'm out of here.
[93:17.59]How did you know that was coming?
[93:20.97]Fine.
[93:22.98]God damn it, where's the car?
[93:27.64]Remember, no tattletales!
[93:37.06]Why was he grinding a fence?
[93:38.32]That's right.
[93:41.87]What was he accomplishing?
[93:42.83]I don't know.
[93:43.61]Let's go.
[93:48.95]He has no political agenda or anything, man.
[93:50.95]He's just a fence guy.
[93:56.60]Alright, this is a fast travel point.
[93:58.06]Unlocked.
[93:58.52]Good.
[94:00.30]If there's a motorcycle in this game, this is probably one of my favorite games from 2017.
[94:05.08]If there's a motorcycle, there better be.
[94:08.24]How dare you have an open world game with no motorcycle?
[94:10.65]There better be one.
[94:11.37]There's stuff here.
[94:25.60]I don't think I'm allowed in here, by the way.
[94:26.96]This is like a hostile place.
[94:35.34]It was red.
[94:35.84]There's stuff in here.
[94:46.52]Apparently nobody lives here.
[94:47.55]That's fine with me.
[94:59.16]What does that mean, though?
[95:02.78]This house's layout is dumb as fuck.
[95:05.26]Was it?
[95:06.64]Was it bad?
[95:18.66]What the hell is that doing?
[95:23.26]What the hell is that?
[95:25.30]Oh, there's a bug in here.
[95:26.96]God damn it, it's an angry one, too.
[95:29.66]There's a fly in here that's going to hit me in the face.
[95:31.24]It's going to fly right into my face.
[95:32.40]It's going to sincerely piss me off.
[95:35.39]Talking about hummus, hummus is amazing.
[95:37.97]If you've never had hummus before, it's a chickpea, tahini, and garlic, usually.
[95:42.31]It's delicious.
[95:44.77]It's all blended up and ground up to a smooth paste.
[95:48.59]I would have to say that you...
[95:55.67]Is this the train?
[95:58.91]This is the train.
[96:00.81]Does it move?
[96:04.77]How do I get the train to move?
[96:11.75]Holy shit.
[96:12.83]I can actually climb on it.
[96:16.11]When does it move?
[96:21.35]It probably doesn't move until tomorrow morning.
[96:28.30]I can't like shoot it to make it work.
[96:32.79]No.
[96:35.91]Damn it.
[96:43.47]This is no locomotive part.
[96:44.95]I don't know.
[96:45.35]What if it was mechanical?
[96:46.13]What if it was electric?
[96:48.61]It very well could be electric.
[96:49.89]It could be an electric train.
[96:58.69]You know how trains work?
[96:59.67]I do.
[97:03.19]You have to shoot a gun at the thing and it'll move.
[97:06.55]That's how a train works, I think.
[97:08.98]They use, like, train bullets.
[97:13.68]Is this where I need to go?
[97:16.96]Who could just see me right here?
[97:17.78]One of these guys could just see me.
[97:20.04]Rescue.
[97:20.91]Rescue.
[97:24.59]Prisoner rescue missions are scattered around the game world.
[97:26.65]Completely misordered with trading goods.
[97:27.87]Before releasing the prison, you have to eliminate all the enemies around.
[97:30.05]We got a guy in there.
[97:35.09]I don't think I noticed anybody over this way.
[97:56.60]Gonna be tagged.
[97:57.90]Okay.
[98:05.16]I don't see any hostages in here.
[98:13.83]Okay.
[98:19.63]Time to rescue the prisoners.
[98:23.00]Alright.
[98:24.86]Congratulations, you've been rescued.
[98:28.75]You are both rescued.
[98:31.47]Alright, what do you got on you?
[98:44.34]Anything else?
[98:45.64]A little bit of loot, no big deal.
[98:50.08]Killed him.
[98:50.46]No, I wanted the loot.
[98:51.67]I wanted the completion.
[98:53.73]It's not always about, like, just LOL, look at the civilian get hit by a car.
[98:59.43]Sometimes you need to make money.
[99:03.14]Now that the mission's over, you bet your bottom dollar, like, I would shoot them both in the back.
[99:06.80]Like, while they're up here, like, running.
[99:09.42]I'm just kidding.
[99:10.18]Don't worry.
[99:10.66]That's a joke.
[99:32.37]Where is it?
[99:33.09]Where the fuck is it?
[99:33.99]Where is it?
[99:40.99]Where is it?
[99:42.79]F?
[99:43.37]No this is- I need- I want this in the- on foot.
[99:50.48]Get the fuck out of here.
[99:51.50]God damn.
[99:54.36]E and F. I press... I literally was trying to press E, and I smudge fat-figured into F. No, that's not going to happen again.
[100:11.28]I'm close.
[100:11.66]I'm 330 miles away.
[100:12.04]330 meters away.
[100:18.38]I only have to run three... I only have to run, like, over, like, nine states.
[100:27.26]What's this?
[100:30.06]I might as well see what the hell this is.
[100:33.46]There's something in here.
[100:37.53]Somebody... There's something up top.
[100:41.91]What's with the heartbeat?
[100:44.87]I can hear the fucking heartbeat right now.
[100:48.68]Can I jump up this?
[100:54.82]I mean, that looks very climbable, right?
[100:56.90]It does.
[100:59.62]It is.
[101:07.11]Oh my god.
[101:15.42]How am I supposed to do this without falling down?
[101:18.40]I'm done.
[101:19.28]I'm fucking gone.
[101:19.98]I don't even care.
[101:21.30]That's a really stupid placement.
[101:22.88]I don't even care.
[101:23.54]Wait, what about here?
[101:27.74]Grab it.
[101:29.60]What the fuck?
[101:30.50]Grab it.
[101:34.24]I can't grab that part.
[101:39.24]Is there a guy up there?
[101:39.88]Let's find out.
[102:10.14]That was on purpose, you fucking idiots.
[102:12.86]You're all a bunch of idiots.
[102:14.59]I'm just kidding.
[102:16.65]I'm just kidding.
[102:17.27]You're all a bunch of fucking idiots.
[102:18.95]No, you're not.
[102:25.53]You're all very wonderful people.
[102:28.41]In fact, I hope you guys have a great day.
[102:31.83]I'm laughing about it a little bit, just a tiny bit.
[102:35.64]I'm laughing about it just a tiny little bit, just a tiny bit.
[102:42.86]Alright, locate hostages, kill the hostages.
[102:44.68]Don't kill the target.
[102:46.04]Target acquired.
[102:48.40]Does this thing have... I don't think that's silenced.
[103:01.49]I gotta do some recon here.
[103:06.07]Damn.
[103:06.85]What?
[103:07.39]Looks like they're digging their own graves.
[103:09.51]There's no time to waste.
[103:10.85]Who are they shooting?
[103:18.30]Oh, you're standing in a perfect place for me to get a double kill here.
[103:28.86]You can't walk up that, really.
[103:30.07]Let's draw it up.
[103:47.44]That's a good spot right there.
[103:48.50]A couple of tagged enemies.
[103:58.21]A couple of more tagged enemies.
[104:00.05]Good.
[104:00.43]Got another guy right there.
[104:02.31]Tagged.
[104:02.61]Alright, we're good.
[104:09.04]Let's get to that sniping roost.
[104:25.22]That guy got his hands up?
[104:26.78]This thing is... This is loud, right?
[104:29.22]This is so loud.
[104:33.54]His brain just came out of his head.
[104:45.39]Can't kill the rooster.
[104:50.25]Loud.
[104:54.28]The devil's church.
[104:57.13]Now, what do we got?
[104:57.65]Let's see.
[104:58.21]We got one, two, three.
[104:59.25]Now, wait for that double collateral lineup.
[105:02.31]We got this guy coming over on the right.
[105:04.79]I can bolt this guy right now.
[105:05.97]No, not yet.
[105:07.99]We're gonna see if we can get a triple collateral.
[105:12.38]It's possible.
[105:14.30]Got a left, got a right.
[105:16.46]Now, these two guys have to die last.
[105:17.76]He's gonna stand right here.
[105:18.70]Please shoot us both!
[105:24.78]I can get this guy the ball.
[105:27.24]It's silent.
[105:28.88]It's quiet.
[105:34.41]Oh, fuck.
[105:38.85]How would you?
[105:40.77]Oh!
[105:53.23]If I didn't fall off the fucking side, I like slid all the way down.
[105:56.44]That better be right there.
[105:57.44]I'm gonna fucking start throwing grenades.
[106:03.02]Thank God.
[106:03.44]I was gonna say, I'm gonna start fucking throwing grenades if that wasn't the case.
[106:06.58]I don't care.
[106:17.53]Good, yeah.
[106:17.99]Search the fucking perimeter.
[106:19.35]Why don't you come over here?
[106:21.15]I don't even care about this, like, stealth bullshit.
[106:23.23]Now they're, like, away from the hostages.
[106:24.51]This is my perfect opportunity.
[106:27.51]Get him right in the throat.
[106:28.36]Let's go straight in.
[106:48.77]Now it looks like they're digging their own graves.
[106:50.93]Walk around the whole map.
[106:57.91]Nice slide.
[106:58.47]They didn't even know where it was.
[107:08.86]Use the bucket as cover.
[107:12.31]He shot him in the leg and he died.
[107:13.29]Good.
[107:31.41]Stealth mission my ass.
[107:33.09]Right in his cheekbone.
[107:46.84]I win.
[107:47.02]That was fun.
[107:52.90]Where's this last guy?
[108:05.14]Is there a guy in here?
[108:07.94]There is.
[108:08.50]It's a fat guy.
[108:14.50]This is a fat guy.
[108:15.18]This is the first fat guy in the game.
[108:16.55]Nice.
[108:21.61]Careful with that.
[108:22.25]You could hurt someone.
[108:23.35]Okay, I thought they were all dead.
[108:26.39]I did.
[108:32.56]Scaffold.
[108:34.45]Looks like someone was sent to restore the ruins.
[108:36.55]I love how this is where I was supposed to go.
[108:38.83]Alright, where are those hostages?
[108:46.64]Easy money.
[108:49.96]I see a diamond over here.
[108:56.03]Oh, that's... That's not good.
[108:59.85]Does this car work?
[109:01.77]Don't kill me, I beg you, please, no!
[109:07.05]Vehicle locked.
[109:07.69]Somebody has the keys.
[109:08.43]Who has the keys?
[109:09.03]I never imagined I'd die like this.
[109:14.93]The area is clear.
[109:16.29]You can make a break for it.
[109:17.27]Oh, please.
[109:19.11]We will never forget what you've done for us.
[109:24.27]Kill the ho- No, I want the keys.
[109:25.59]I need the keys.
[109:32.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[109:32.81]What about this car?
[109:35.93]Can I get in?
[109:36.29]Give me your keys.
[109:41.66]What?
[109:42.20]No!
[109:42.92]No!
[109:54.24]Put me where I win, right?
[109:54.90]Thank God.
[110:06.94]Is the car here?
[110:07.58]Oh, come on!
[110:10.50]What the fuck?
[110:15.05]Wait, are these the civilians?
[110:23.91]Is this an alternate universe where I didn't win?
[110:26.52]I need to get into this vehicle.
[110:32.86]I have to fucking get in there.
[110:34.10]Who has the keys?
[110:38.88]For the love of God, one of you guys over here has to have the keys, right?
[110:42.93]I don't know.
[110:44.85]I'm going to fast travel, but there's like a diamond right here.
[110:46.97]Trading goods.
[111:01.97]Mechanical parts.
[111:03.35]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[111:04.66]Some shrine.
[111:05.36]Let's fucking smash it.
[111:08.28]Who cares?
[111:13.14]Outside?
[111:18.16]Keys never existed.
[111:20.16]Do I eventually learn a skill to unlock cars or something?
[111:23.28]Because that would be very useful.
[111:29.09]Alright, I'm just going.
[111:30.53]I'm fast traveling.
[111:31.39]Just check this little corner and then get out of here.
[111:36.81]Here we go.
[111:37.61]Climb this, alright?
[111:43.15]Why do I feel like I shouldn't be able to do this?
[111:45.43]It was really weird.
[111:53.08]What?
[112:05.67]I don't know.
[112:09.31]I'm fast.
[112:09.85]Fast travel, please.
[112:10.71]Thank you.
[112:15.90]There's my car.
[112:16.56]Why is fast traveling not possible?
[112:22.38]Exfiltrate.
[112:22.98]Give me a break.
[112:23.58]How far of a drop is this?
[112:33.74]Is that water?
[112:35.94]No.
[112:36.08]Can I just grab the ledge?
[112:38.86]Grab the ledge.
[112:40.20]God damn it.
[112:41.00]I want to just get down there.
[112:47.93]Grab the ledge.
[112:48.45]Grab the ledge.
[112:48.97]Grab a ledge.
[112:49.87]Any ledge.
[112:50.35]Any ledge will do.
[112:50.95]I don't care which one it is.
[112:53.07]I'm stuck here.
[112:54.15]Great.
[112:56.55]What about that tree?
[112:57.45]Like down here into the tree.
[113:00.01]No.
[113:00.19]I'm going to die.
[113:06.71]Look at that.
[113:07.33]Fucking just right-click and you won't take fall damage.
[113:13.17]Nice, I win.
[113:14.85]100% accuracy.
[113:15.29]Good to go.
[113:17.13]New weapon.
[113:17.39]Thanks!
[113:17.53]Okay...
[113:38.11]It was fucking heartbreaking.
[113:44.88]Archer.
[113:45.48]Let's... 9,200.
[113:46.26]What?
[113:50.20]Garrett.
[113:51.32]No.
[113:53.74]This is fine.
[114:01.15]I don't have any new... I can't do any... I can't unlock any of this shit.
[114:05.60]He's another separatist top lieutenant.
[114:07.94]Vicious, sadist, pure evil.
[114:10.56]But nothing on Tomas or Davit?
[114:12.92]That intel will come.
[114:14.56]I know Kobo.
[114:15.78]It sounds like he was just trying to mispronounce their names.
[114:18.36]Like, on purpose.
[114:20.96]Hey, thank you, Miguel, for the bits.
[114:23.33]Thanks a lot.
[114:24.47]He just says urine.
[114:25.81]Says urine, that's all.
[114:28.39]Got some skill points, right?
[114:31.07]I guess we just...
[114:35.05]Requires two points this requires two points.
[114:37.71]I only have one point in each Got armor light armor put it on Block out Assassinate this guy you got Got some new Intel for me
[115:06.45]Uh, car is up front.
[115:07.55]Sound good?
[115:07.79]What about the ICC?
[115:09.01]So you get your car back every time.
[115:12.11]That's so good.
[115:12.95]I'm so happy about that.
[115:14.16]I'm so hungry, by the way.
[115:15.64]Oh, dude.
[115:15.86]Oh, I can't wait.
[115:17.02]Me and Kim.
[115:17.30]Shut the fuck up.
[115:17.76]I'm trying to talk.
[115:35.26]Shut up for a second.
[115:38.58]So me and Kim are going to get sushi after this.
[115:41.60]At this late night sushi place.
[115:42.82]It's gonna be awesome.
[115:45.21]Sushi is like one of my favorite things now for some reason.
[115:47.59]I don't know why.
[115:50.75]I always hated sushi.
[115:51.57]I thought like sushi wasn't like good.
[115:53.95]I had like a problem with it being, you know, raw fish and raw fish is not good.
[115:57.25]It's gonna get diseased.
[115:59.02]I'm gonna get like a tapeworm.
[116:00.36]You know, I was always... Anybody else in this chat scared of tapeworms?
[116:06.88]I am scared of tapeworms.
[116:08.34]I think I'm going to get them all the time.
[116:12.04]So any way that it was possible for me to get a tapeworm was like, I'm going to get a tapeworm.
[116:16.58]It's going to happen.
[116:17.08]I'm going to be the guy that goes to the restaurant, gets like the medium rare steak and gets a fucking tapeworm.
[116:22.01]I'm the guy that's going to get like the tuna roll and I'm going to get a fucking tapeworm.
[116:27.21]I always thought it was going to happen.
[116:33.39]What the fuck is happening right now?
[116:39.32]So that's what I was always scared of.
[116:41.04]Vegetarian?
[116:41.80]I'm not a vegetarian.
[116:42.34]Like, you know, I'm just going to investigate the house.
[116:44.72]Okay, now I can turn the dialog back on.
[116:49.20]I was always just scared.
[116:50.66]Because undercooked food scared the shit out of me.
[117:04.59]What is in here?
[117:07.03]Point of interest.
[117:09.34]Bullet heads.
[117:10.90]Well, it doesn't do very much for me right now.
[117:14.38]Mechanical parts.
[117:22.10]What else is in here?
[117:24.20]I thought that was a car that I could use.
[117:25.62]There's more stuff in here, I guess.
[117:27.68]I don't know.
[117:34.48]Collectibles.
[117:40.38]No.
[117:41.04]They don't do anything.
[117:45.14]What a strange little figurine.
[117:50.84]You can get tapeworms from video games?
[117:53.05]Sure you could.
[117:54.77]You ate a video game, and the video game happened to be an undercooked piece of fish.
[118:02.22]By the way, all these noises sounds like not a car crashing.
[118:06.50]It sounds like you're living in an apartment building and the person like two doors down from you inside their apartment is having work done.
[118:16.06]Like they're having construction work done.
[118:17.20]That's it.
[118:20.10]I gotta be able to get in here, right?
[118:21.54]Why?
[118:21.96]I swear to God, these cars don't work.
[118:24.32]They're just here for show.
[118:25.98]They don't actually do anything.
[118:39.62]Oh, look, another one.
[118:40.88]I wonder if this one works.
[118:45.75]You can get a taper from drinking water.
[118:47.25]Yeah, dirty water.
[118:48.83]You think I can just drive in here and run the guy over?
[118:53.21]Try to find the other way.
[118:54.15]Maybe you can take him out from a distance.
[119:10.09]I don't know how I'm still alive.
[119:22.29]I think I can do it.
[119:23.63]I think I can do it.
[119:24.21]I just got stuck on a table because this game's fucking dumb.
[119:28.53]I say that as I'm trying to drive into the mission.
[119:35.50]An open Jeep.
[119:38.15]And now, because I'm being punished, I lost the Jeep.
[119:42.27]I've been punished for very understandable reasons.
[119:45.01]I'm being punished.
[119:49.01]We have to get the drone out here.
[119:56.44]One right there.
[119:58.02]Anybody on the roof?
[120:00.46]Anybody up there on the roof?
[120:08.59]A lot of fucking people here.
[120:17.39]Anybody else?
[120:19.19]Couple of cars that... Everyone here has to die because I want to find car keys.
[120:24.49]That's fine.
[120:24.97]Nobody heard that, right?
[120:37.64]Good.
[120:56.54]Not it's not a good time not a good time to do Okay Keys car keys
[121:26.26]This is where we fucking... This is where we have to move.
[121:29.02]And this... Where's my grenades?
[121:31.04]Where are my grenades?
[121:32.44]What?
[121:32.94]Where the fuck are my grenades?
[121:34.98]Oh, what an absolute monstrosity.
[121:38.74]And I'm dead.
[121:39.80]Where the... Why are my grenades not even there?
[121:41.54]What the fuck?
[121:42.72]I had, like, nine.
[121:47.96]I wanted to, like, throw all my grenades down there.
[121:54.48]You don't have grenades.
[121:55.24]You're...
[121:55.97]You bought nine.
[121:58.89]You bought nine.
[121:59.79]Yeah.
[122:00.63]What do you mean I unbound them?
[122:04.31]No, I didn't.
[122:11.88]Unbound them?
[122:15.60]Right there.
[122:16.04]Use gadget.
[122:19.18]Oh, fucking eat my asshole.
[122:20.84]Why?
[122:21.16]Go around.
[122:31.65]Give me the rock.
[122:46.81]You want to play that game?
[122:58.72]Can I get in?
[122:59.40]I can go in the window, yeah.
[123:01.60]Stealth kill this guy.
[123:02.52]Okay, I did not know that guy was in here.
[123:18.79]Oh, fuck.
[123:31.41]Grab him.
[123:36.66]I don't want the AK.
[123:47.42]I got to load this guy in here.
[124:00.45]Is he hearing me?
[124:08.19]Alright, now come in here.
[124:10.77]Good.
[124:11.73]You're learning.
[124:13.28]You're learning very well.
[124:22.48]How do I interrogate somebody?
[124:29.23]I... Like... I'm gonna be honest with you.
[124:34.53]That was fucking dumb.
[124:35.95]Because, like, my guy put his hands up.
[124:38.83]Like this.
[124:39.23]The guy's like this.
[124:41.09]Why did that happen?
[124:57.46]I walked towards the guy and my guy puts his fucking hands in the air.
[125:06.55]Alright, this one's for real.
[125:07.59]No more fucking around.
[125:08.43]Yeah, this is fine.
[125:16.68]Yeah, like, take a look at this fucking rock over there, dickhead.
[125:18.98]I can't throw it because I have... Can't do that.
[125:27.99]Throw the rock.
[125:32.27]Now I can't throw rocks.
[125:35.21]Why can I not throw the rock?
[125:38.15]Why am I putting my gun at the ground?
[125:41.21]I'm gonna die from this.
[125:45.75]See if the tactic works.
[125:47.43]It does.
[125:49.25]This game's broken.
[125:50.43]If you guys want to play and not have to take fall damage, just hold down right click.
[125:53.09]Just aim down sights.
[125:55.39]I still can't throw a rock.
[126:00.68]Now I can.
[126:02.08]Good thing I just had to test it right there.
[126:18.74]I was trying to interrogate him.
[126:23.34]Seriously, like, I was... Why would he whip around like that?
[126:29.92]Really?
[126:30.46]Like, what's the point of that?
[126:36.15]He just, like, rips the fuck around.
[126:38.07]Like, I didn't press V, I was trying to press E. E is interrogate.
[126:43.93]How the fuck... I don't even care, I'm just gonna sit here.
[126:45.37]This game is dumb.
[126:57.30]Is the guy just walking around upstairs?
[126:58.63]Yeah.
[127:17.36]There's one more guy in here.
[127:18.42]I know it for a fact.
[127:21.98]You can't run one past... I thought the trash bag was the guy.
[127:32.62]Apparently not.
[127:33.20]Can I not open this door?
[127:34.00]Can't get on the balcony?
[127:37.66]Okay.
[127:39.14]No doors open here.
[127:40.22]You can definitely get that.
[127:49.62]Oh my god, he's sliding around like an asshole, really?
[128:01.55]What are you doing?
[128:02.49]Stop sliding.
[128:04.61]The corridors are so small that I fucking just slide when I hit a crouch.
[128:11.77]Alright, the sniper can see me.
[128:16.56]Although he shouldn't.
[128:17.78]He shouldn't be able to.
[128:18.54]I'm gonna be in a good spot up here.
[128:35.53]Okay.
[128:44.45]Sniper down.
[128:47.41]There's another sniper.
[128:48.66]Where are you?
[128:49.20]I want a mortar.
[128:52.28]Do I have explosive bullets?
[128:54.68]No.
[129:03.38]What's that noise?
[129:11.84]So many people over here.
[129:24.10]Shit.
[129:35.98]Enemy must be nearby.
[129:36.98]Search the perimeter.
[129:38.90]Walter, be on the lookout for enemy movement.
[129:45.32]Gotta be quiet here.
[129:50.81]Why do I have to fucking go?
[129:52.35]Who told me this was a good idea?
[130:01.71]There's a guy that was in this building, right?
[130:04.70]Where is he?
[130:05.10]What the fuck was that?
[130:06.76]What was that?
[130:10.60]Watering the building?
[130:18.97]Okay.
[130:22.23]Are they just dropping?
[130:23.01]They just dropped it on themselves.
[130:40.09]Oh, my silence is low.
[130:41.57]I better fix it.
[130:42.21]What are you doing?
[130:46.93]Fix it.
[130:55.44]Got him.
[131:00.78]Where am I getting shot from?
[131:09.59]Stupid.
[131:14.04]Alright, now's my chance to shine here.
[131:28.05]There we go.
[131:37.05]God damn it.
[131:44.52]Alright, you know what?
[131:47.90]Fine.
[131:51.80]Fine.
[131:54.04]I'm coming out.
[132:02.85]Which one of you has the keys to the car?
[132:05.73]I will find it.
[132:21.10]You guys are so hidden.
[132:22.64]Come out from hiding.
[132:25.00]Or don't.
[132:32.64]Come on, stay there.
[132:42.87]Can I mortar this guy?
[132:45.17]That would be a great finish to this mission, I think.
[132:50.85]Where the fuck is this guy?
[132:53.67]Where?
[132:54.17]Up there?
[132:57.36]Fuck me.
[132:57.84]No.
[132:58.82]Don't do it.
[132:59.26]Don't do it.
[132:59.88]Don't do it.
[133:27.03]Find the mortar keys.
[133:29.95]Why can I not use this?
[133:31.23]That's so annoying.
[133:33.03]I should be able to, right?
[133:36.89]Frag grenade, trading goods, no keys to a car.
[133:54.61]Keys.
[134:02.43]I can't use it, I don't think.
[134:07.38]Keys.
[134:11.30]Trading goods.
[134:13.17]No keys.
[134:16.23]No keys.
[134:22.19]There's a guy in the back of this car?
[134:35.03]No.
[134:37.94]The dude's in this building, right?
[134:46.50]Honestly, I can't get in there.
[134:49.80]Can I not get in this?
[134:51.59]Of course not.
[134:56.25]I gotta craft the keys.
[135:04.35]That's not how you door.
[135:05.45]This guy's still just, like, chanting.
[135:08.25]Do I have to just go in the front door?
[135:13.37]I probably do.
[135:14.03]Okay.
[135:16.47]I guess we have to go in the front door.
[135:17.75]No, that door don't open.
[135:20.23]Instead, I need to go in the front door.
[135:21.69]There's a window there.
[135:23.97]Front door here.
[135:24.65]This dude's just still rambling over the microphone.
[135:33.99]He's just locked in a room doing his speech.
[136:07.93]He's still talking.
[136:10.89]I don't think I can move.
[136:13.77]Yeah, I'm locked here, guys.
[136:17.12]I can just undulate my arms.
[136:21.92]There's got to be something I can do here, right?
[136:34.10]If I can, like, step over him.
[136:41.21]I have to do the whole mission again, by the way, everybody.
[136:56.06]Tony just gave money.
[136:57.84]Cigarette spaghetti just gave... I can't throw a grenade.
[136:59.76]I can't do anything.
[137:04.78]It's giving me the indicator that I can throw a grenade, but I can't do it.
[137:08.74]Cigarette spaghetti, thank you.
[137:09.86]True ghost in action.
[137:10.68]Thanks for the $50.
[137:11.14]I have to restart this, I think.
[137:24.07]Thank you, though, so much.
[137:25.15]Also, thank you, Bob the Mon for $5.
[137:27.45]What's the second ingredient in a tapeworm?
[137:32.01]Sludge.
[137:34.41]Also, thanks for cigarette spaghetti again.
[137:43.98]Is he still talking?
[137:45.06]Does he have keys on him?
[137:46.96]Gas grenade.
[138:10.75]I'm going upstairs, apparently.
[138:18.14]I gotta get rid of this dude, really.
[138:22.50]He's gonna cause problems.
[138:23.84]I need to find who's talking.
[138:37.77]Alright, he's in this room.
[138:42.97]People are laughing.
[138:45.99]Fucking TV.
[138:46.39]I thought there was a room of people laughing at his jokes.
[138:49.21]No, it was a fucking TV.
[139:04.25]There's a bunch of people in there thinking everything he says is so funny.
[139:15.11]Get up.
[139:16.65]New clue found.
[139:17.51]What are you looking for clues for?
[139:18.89]Shut up.
[139:22.35]Alright, let's go.
[139:25.42]Out, out, out.
[139:29.62]I gotta recover a drone, but I don't.
[139:31.18]Who cares?
[139:36.12]Throw a dude off the roof.
[139:44.51]We do one more mission and then I'm calling it a night.
[139:50.49]I got sushi to eat.
[139:52.47]I'm doing one last attempt at one more mission.
[139:55.60]Then it's sushi time.
[140:03.84]No keys either.
[140:10.15]That's so annoying.
[140:10.99]Nothing.
[140:11.31]I can't, like, check the windows.
[140:12.67]Of course not.
[140:14.69]Aye, aye, aye.
[140:15.21]That's a pain.
[140:15.77]Yeah, I gotta go get myself a nice tapeworm.
[140:21.17]In fact, mmm... This place is only open... Yeah, I'm gonna have to call it a night here, guys.
[140:26.06]In the next, uh, like, 10, 15.
[140:32.68]We can dick around for, like, another 20 minutes.
[140:35.34]But I have to, uh...
[140:38.44]I gotta go.
[140:38.94]This place is only open until midnight.
[140:40.56]Thanks, I think.
[140:42.50]No, I'm serious.
[140:44.26]The separatists are spooked by your efficiency.
[140:46.38]Let's just give something a try.
[140:47.16]They figured out there is a new gunning town.
[140:50.38]Cut off.
[140:51.90]Yeah, this communication is gone.
[140:52.84]You got more on the satellite comms?
[140:54.45]Yeah.
[140:55.63]JSOC wants you to redirect the broadcast signal.
[140:57.83]Where can I fast travel to?
[141:02.45]Fast travel to here.
[141:04.05]Manually?
[141:07.91]Unlocked tapeworm.
[141:09.17]And the car's right here, too.
[141:10.28]That's great.
[141:11.10]It's just great.
[141:12.20]Yeah, me and Tim are gonna have a nice romantic sushi dinner.
[141:14.54]We both enjoy sushi very much.
[141:16.48]You know, I used to not like it.
[141:17.26]Open my eyes.
[141:17.76]Describe what you think about this game in one word.
[141:38.99]Frank, I have a visual on the base.
[141:41.05]I can't do that.
[141:42.65]I can't describe that.
[141:43.79]Make your way inside and reposition them to the coordinates I've uploaded to your tablet.
[141:49.91]Be careful with your drone.
[141:51.41]If you fly it too close to the dishes, their signals won't interfere with its frequency.
[141:55.44]The scientists inside the facility will alert the guards if they spot you, so be cautious.
[142:00.36]You can try sneaking past them or maybe somehow lure them out.
[142:04.58]See if there's anything nearby that you can use.
[142:08.77]Don't kill any scientists.
[142:11.63]Too late.
[142:12.59]No, maybe not too late.
[142:19.02]Tear gas.
[142:26.16]Holy shit.
[142:30.02]Where?
[142:31.90]Alright, last attempt.
[142:32.76]One last try.
[142:35.89]What is this, perfect dark?
[142:38.53]Now the game crashed.
[142:42.93]The game crashed.
[142:44.15]Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 has stopped working.
[142:50.09]And just to prove it, just to prove so people don't think I'm trying to get the fuck out of here.
[142:55.09]Just to make sure you guys understand, this is not a joke.
[142:58.13]I'm not making this up.
[142:59.25]There it is.
[142:59.59]There you go.
[143:07.10]I'm not kidding.
[143:13.18]When did it ever start working?
[143:16.11]I love how I can just do that, by the way.
[143:18.97]Wait, what happened?
[143:20.83]Is this in, like, Russian?
[143:24.59]What happened to this?
[143:30.37]Even this got fucked up.
[143:31.76]What the fuck is this saying?
[143:41.87]Is it upside down?
[143:45.52]Apparently.
[143:46.20]But yeah.
[143:50.48]$200 joke right there.
[143:51.34]It's all employed.
[143:52.18]No, I swear to God.
[143:59.34]How'd you do this?
[144:00.00]It's mirrored.
[144:00.62]It's mirrored and upside down.
[144:02.34]It's hard to see.
[144:02.86]Alright.
[144:04.94]Well, that's it then.
[144:06.64]The game crashed.
[144:08.04]So that was my last attempt.
[144:09.26]I'm going to go get sushi.
[144:11.35]Hopefully you enjoyed this.
[144:12.39]I actually had a lot of fun playing this tonight.
[144:14.41]As stupid as this game was and as over the top as some of the stuff was, it was good.
[144:19.90]Pretend you didn't even watch the WALL-E portion for the first 30 minutes.
[144:24.40]And I'll see you guys live tomorrow.
[144:26.68]Tomorrow is going well.
[144:29.14]Let me do this.
[144:33.12]Tomorrow, I want to do this PC build stream thing.
[144:37.94]And it requires, like, a little bit of effort.
[144:42.19]And by a little bit, I mean I need to get a lot of stuff ready.
[144:44.67]So, E3 is the next day I leave for California on Monday.
[144:50.57]So...
[144:52.46]or Tuesday, whatever.
[144:55.60]I might not have enough time to set it up, but I will be streaming tomorrow.
[144:59.86]E3, if you'll be in California, I'll see you there.
[145:02.71]If you're going to be at E3, please wave me down and say hello.
[145:06.03]I'd love to talk to you.
[145:09.49]I plan on doing an IRL stream from E3, just because I'm not going to be live at all the entire week.
[145:20.73]So you'll probably see me pop up maybe for like...
[145:26.46]It's not gonna be a full-on stream.
[145:28.94]You know, if I stream from E3 or I stream, like, in California, it's legit gonna be, like, a 30-minute stream.
[145:36.02]Going from, like, place to place or doing something.
[145:38.02]It's not gonna be a long stream if I even do it.
[145:41.28]But regardless, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
[145:43.98]Have fun, everybody.
[145:44.82]I hope you have a good Saturday.
[145:45.92]If you're out or if you're doing something or if you have plans, be safe.
[145:52.84]And I'll see you guys
[145:54.58]What should you set the sus to for next week?
[145:56.71]Well, um, nothing.
[146:00.13]Just say, like, make the sus just say, like, I'm at E3.
[146:03.93]And I might throw in, like, a random IRL stream during the week, but I'm currently at E3, is I guess what you could say.
[146:11.30]Anyways, much love, guys.
[146:12.66]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[146:13.52]Thanks to all the people that were supporting during the stream with the money.
[146:18.64]Some people gave some cash tonight.
[146:23.78]And it's much appreciated.
[146:24.67]Take care, guys.
[146:25.59]See you tomorrow.
[146:26.59]Same time, same place, same network.
[146:28.57]Goodbye.
