[01:07.31]Hi, everybody.
[01:08.81]Hello.
[01:09.79]Hold on.
[01:22.48]So, I am, uh... I am exhausted right now.
[01:26.12]I'm very tired.
[01:28.41]But I did want to stream for a little while.
[01:30.09]At least do something.
[01:30.91]Because I am, uh... I am fucking infuriated.
[01:34.61]I am infuriated.
[01:39.66]It's typical for me, right?
[01:41.38]I get mad sometimes.
[01:44.03]But this guy, the title of this stream, if you're curious, is the fucking complain stream.
[01:49.51]That's what we're going to do.
[01:50.29]We're going to complain for like an hour and then I'm going to bed.
[01:54.57]And somebody just gave a lot of money.
[01:55.97]Hold on a second.
[01:56.58]What did they say?
[02:00.32]Ashbringer, the Ashbringer108, thank you for your $50 right off the bat.
[02:07.60]I heard this is going to be a complaint stream.
[02:09.25]It is.
[02:10.39]It is.
[02:12.05]But thank you for the $50, Ashbringer.
[02:15.09]Hopefully you and Tyrion Fordring will fucking save the planet Pluto from sheer disaster.
[02:25.22]But thank you so much.
[02:26.82]I appreciate it.
[02:29.19]Anyways, so what we're going to complain about is computers.
[02:33.62]And how for some reason I seem to have this horrible fucking bad luck.
[02:36.96]We can turn this off though.
[02:40.50]So we are going to go back to Mortal Redneck.
[02:44.10]No Twitch integration tonight.
[02:47.20]I want to chill and just read chat.
[02:49.74]And see what you guys have to say about the world.
[02:53.20]Give me one more second though.
[02:56.48]When I drink coffee, it is very late.
[02:58.74]It's about 10.30 here, and that's not even very late.
[03:03.33]It's kind of late.
[03:05.65]Let the hate flow through you.
[03:07.41]So, you guys won't survive without our help.
[03:11.67]I'm not going for wins.
[03:13.59]This is going to be like a complain cast.
[03:15.53]It's going to be a complain podcast.
[03:18.83]We're just like talk shit about people.
[03:20.33]Alright.
[03:20.57]So what have I got here?
[03:24.01]This guy with the weird bat box.
[03:26.19]Okay.
[03:26.81]Alright.
[03:27.89]This guy, you hurt yourself.
[03:28.83]I don't even know what this guy does, but who cares?
[03:30.30]Alright.
[03:32.46]So earlier today, I was supposed to stream and my dog is just like coming in this room.
[03:39.96]Hold on.
[03:48.32]Alright, so, earlier today I was gonna stream, uh, Yakuza.
[03:52.16]Which is a PlayStation 4 game, as we all know.
[03:54.31]Uh, I have an in- this is my- I'm on a brand new computer.
[03:58.35]I got this custom-built computer.
[03:59.67]Computer's brand new.
[04:01.95]And I figured, oh, nice!
[04:03.22]Uh, I might as well get an internal capture card.
[04:06.60]Because, you know, an external capture card is annoying.
[04:09.68]It has a delay.
[04:10.28]There's a stream... There's a delay when you use an external capture card.
[04:15.12]It's like a full second and a half.
[04:17.00]It's really annoying to sync up.
[04:18.62]It can go out of sync, and it's really fucking annoying.
[04:20.78]So I had the people that built this computer put in an internal capture card.
[04:28.05]And the fucking thing just doesn't even work.
[04:29.63]It's just bricked.
[04:30.91]And I didn't even know that it was bricked, because why would I even... Why would I even think that was going to happen?
[04:36.58]You know what I mean?
[04:37.08]I go to, like, to set up, like, Yakuza, like, oh, here we go.
[04:39.64]Plug in.
[04:40.00]I hear, I got my internal fucking PCI Express capture card.
[04:44.07]Nice!
[04:45.59]It doesn't, thing doesn't even fucking turn on.
[04:47.43]It won't even do anything.
[04:48.95]I actually went in and I switched PCI slots.
[04:50.81]The thing's just broken.
[04:56.06]Like, what the fuck?
[04:57.60]Why?
[04:57.96]Why?
[05:02.37]Didn't build your own computer.
[05:03.59]See, I've built, I told you guys, I've built my own computer before and I did it fine and then it like made a bunch of buzzing sounds and I cried.
[05:09.61]You guys have heard that story before.
[05:11.93]What do these bats do?
[05:18.66]And I got it built by like a fucking, I didn't get, some like random guy, the Geek Squad didn't build this computer.
[05:25.00]This was done by a huge, like prestigious company.
[05:29.95]By the way, fuck this company.
[05:31.89]I haven't determined if I'm going to talk shit about this company yet.
[05:34.58]It depends on how well they treat me when I go in and talk to them.
[05:38.00]You know what I mean?
[05:40.96]It depends on how well they fucking treat me when I go speak to them.
[05:48.26]Why complain to us when you can complain to them and shut them down?
[05:50.69]Oh, they heard a stern phone call this afternoon.
[05:53.65]I can tell you that.
[05:55.56]But it was one of those stern phone calls where the guy that I was talking to really clearly didn't give a shit and had nothing to do with the problem.
[06:01.81]I'm just like, yeah, I have a paying customer.
[06:03.19]This computer was thousands of dollars.
[06:04.45]I'm going to speak to a manager.
[06:05.43]And he's just like, okay.
[06:08.01]He didn't give a fuck.
[06:09.41]What did he care?
[06:09.91]Like, what does this guy care?
[06:13.43]He had nothing to do with it.
[06:14.24]He's a guy like answering phones.
[06:18.52]You need to calm down.
[06:19.88]Well, that's the thing, though.
[06:20.82]Like, I can't calm down.
[06:23.58]Because I, like, bought this fucking computer.
[06:27.48]Thinking all my technical problems were gonna go away.
[06:29.66]I'm gonna spend a bunch of fucking money, I'm gonna invest in the stream, let the stream look better.
[06:35.62]And, like, my USB ports on the front of the fucking case don't work.
[06:39.21]There was, like, a cooling driver installation problem.
[06:41.73]My internal capture card doesn't fucking work.
[06:45.39]It's like, did I- did somebody build this computer with fucking, like, toothpicks?
[06:48.81]Or is this a fucking computer?
[06:51.21]Like, did you not even test the USB ports in the front?
[06:53.57]Are you fucking out of your mind?
[06:56.15]You didn't even plug, like, a USB port thing.
[06:58.39]You didn't put, like, a thumb drive in to make sure it works?
[07:02.68]Walmart computer.
[07:03.66]It very well should have been.
[07:07.40]I told you, this is a complaint stream.
[07:15.32]Yay, when you click on this stream, you know exactly what you're getting.
[07:22.37]I actually like this gun.
[07:26.57]Uh, active skill at this thing.
[07:29.09]Still don't even like know what the hell this does.
[07:32.87]You don't build USBs when you build a computer.
[07:36.14]Wait, no, I'm talking about like the USB slots on the front of my case that are connected to the motherboard as like the USB hub controller just don't even work.
[07:46.64]It's like the guy got that far and was like, oh shit, I forgot to plug that into the motherboard.
[07:52.40]Whoops.
[07:53.54]I ain't fucking taking apart my work and doing it again to make sure I do that.
[07:56.88]It's staying.
[07:57.40]Because I opened it and I tried to see where the cords were, but the way that the cables are done, there's a lot of cable work.
[08:07.64]So I would have to undo all this guy's cable work to do this.
[08:12.75]Let's go this way.
[08:16.05]The computer is built nicely.
[08:17.59]It's not like a badly built computer.
[08:19.63]And obviously I'm using it right now.
[08:23.51]But all these little things put together was just like, dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[08:28.27]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[08:38.02]I've seemed to have just terrible luck with technology recently.
[08:42.09]And it's affecting the streams.
[08:43.29]And it's obviously like,
[08:46.08]Obviously, I want to stream when I say I want to stream.
[08:51.05]And I want to stream, I want to have fun, I want to make sure the things I'm doing are interesting for you guys and fun for you guys.
[08:56.77]Like, it's very fucking important to me.
[08:59.83]And when I, like, can't do those things because of stuff that's, like, not even in my control, it drives me fucking... Jerm is a control freak.
[09:08.38]You know, I have to have control of the situation.
[09:12.12]These bats, like, these bats really suck.
[09:15.85]Might as well just use him.
[09:20.42]Can I even play this game if I'm angry?
[09:21.86]This is kind of in the background, just sitting here.
[09:25.55]While I talk to you guys and hang out.
[09:27.01]Ashbringer, again, Ashbringer.
[09:28.21]This is $100 now.
[09:30.93]I accidentally typed the first cheer as just a regular message, jermaMoon.
[09:35.13]So I decided to make another one just to let you know that I want to say thank you for all the things you've done for us.
[09:40.25]These bits don't even cover half of what you've done for me personally.
[09:44.09]Well, Ashbringer, like... Like, look at what you're doing for me.
[09:49.49]Look at what you just did for me.
[09:52.39]You know what I mean?
[09:52.89]Like, that's... You just gave me a hundred fucking dollars.
[09:56.05]Like, you guys do so much for me.
[10:01.27]It's like unbelievable how much you fucking guys have done for me over the years.
[10:06.05]So thank you.
[10:07.25]Thank you guys for fucking sticking around and being here and for giving me like money and shit like that.
[10:13.09]Like you guys have done so much shit for me.
[10:16.63]It's like remarkable.
[10:21.73]Let's go over here.
[10:25.83]And then also it's me.
[10:26.89]Lum with 10 bucks says complain stream.
[10:29.83]Yep.
[10:30.70]That's what we're doing.
[10:31.64]And then, uh, it's me, Lum.
[10:32.64]Again, 15 bucks total so far.
[10:34.26]Thank you.
[10:34.56]It's me, Lum.
[10:35.60]We love you.
[10:37.52]Jeremy.
[10:40.35]Oh, shit.
[10:40.73]This is supposed to be a complaint stream.
[10:41.99]I forgot.
[10:43.75]But, like, that's why this shit pisses me off.
[10:47.27]Because... Like, there's a lot of subscribers to this channel.
[10:51.69]There's a lot of people that give money and...
[10:55.24]I don't want to just- I don't want to just fucking like- Oh yeah, I'm gonna stream at 7 o'clock.
[10:59.91]Nah, I'm not doing it.
[11:01.01]Something went wrong.
[11:01.83]Oh, something went wrong again.
[11:03.19]Fuck it.
[11:03.55]Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
[11:07.15]I want to like- I want the streams to be fucking good.
[11:09.75]I want you guys to think that they're fun.
[11:12.57]And I want you to like not have to worry about like- Ah, a Jerma's gonna stream at like 7 o'clock?
[11:16.49]Nah.
[11:17.73]He's just not even here for like three days.
[11:24.05]The burning bridges stream.
[11:29.40]I like this gun.
[11:30.60]I'm going to right click.
[11:32.32]I don't know what that does.
[11:33.92]But I hope... It just took away a lot of maximum health.
[11:38.57]Your assistant is so far.
[11:39.87]Don't even trip.
[11:42.10]Yeah, but, like, here's... Alright, here's the thing.
[11:45.42]A lot of times people say, like, oh, don't worry about it, don't worry about it, it's alright, like, shit happens, like, you know, the last few weeks has been, like, fucking all over the place, but don't worry about it, right?
[11:53.89]But that's what I do.
[11:55.79]I do worry about it.
[11:57.17]I do... Because, like, I'm... I'm the guy that's, like, Mr. Worry Man.
[12:04.71]I worry about everything.
[12:08.39]I'm that guy.
[12:11.21]I've been that guy my whole life.
[12:12.55]I've been Mr. Worry Man my entire life.
[12:18.85]I want things to be good.
[12:20.71]I want you guys to be like...
[12:23.27]I want you guys to enjoy the time that's here.
[12:25.31]And look, I can tell.
[12:26.87]I can tell when a stream sucks.
[12:28.69]Trust me.
[12:29.87]You guys think you can tell when a stream sucks?
[12:32.51]I can tell when a stream sucks.
[12:33.97]Or when a video sucks.
[12:35.27]And it drives me fucking crazy.
[12:36.75]It fucking pisses me off so bad.
[12:38.48]Because I'm sitting there just going like, this fucking shit sucks.
[12:42.16]Hopefully nobody notices that this... Of course you notice when it sucks.
[12:48.02]Of course you do.
[12:48.66]Oh, that's nice.
[12:50.56]Crit ammo.
[13:00.19]We're all Mr. Worry Man.
[13:02.69]Hey, don't worry, man.
[13:03.65]Mr. Worry Man.
[13:05.97]Thank you, Skalendon, for the five bucks.
[13:09.29]Here's a little something to buy some salami.
[13:12.65]You know what?
[13:13.07]That sounds good to me.
[13:19.53]But I want to increase the value of these streams, not decrease them.
[13:25.42]And that's something that I struggle with on a day-to-day basis.
[13:31.13]I want these streams to be valuable to you guys, and valuable to me.
[13:36.27]Not valuable in a monetary sense, but I love when shit just goes right.
[13:41.82]And when shit goes wrong, on stream especially, or an hour before stream, it makes me want to tear my fucking eyeballs out.
[13:50.45]Like, an hour before the stream was supposed to start today at noon.
[13:54.52]There was no reason for me to ever think that my internal fucking PCI Express capture card was bricked.
[14:00.05]There was no way for me to know.
[14:01.95]Because I didn't have to... I wasn't, like, playing a PlayStation game.
[14:04.51]I wasn't playing, like, a PS4 game this week or last week.
[14:07.18]I was doing other stuff.
[14:08.06]Why would I even... Why would I even think that my brand new computer would have a bricked capture card?
[14:13.77]And like an hour before the stream, it's like, I got a bricked capture card.
[14:16.77]Now what the fuck am I gonna do?
[14:17.67]Now I'm trying to like fix it while, all the while of like sitting here trying to type in chat like, I've got technical problems again.
[14:27.22]I'll see you guys at 2.40.
[14:32.02]It's like, what the fuck?
[14:34.14]And then it just didn't work at all.
[14:35.58]And I turn my computer off.
[14:37.18]I'm fucking pulling out switches.
[14:42.98]Do the Twitch integration.
[14:43.70]I'll do that before I go to bed.
[14:44.96]We'll do like one or two runs of the Twitch integration.
[14:52.68]And now here I am at like fucking 11 o'clock at night.
[14:56.24]And I'm not even doing the thing that I wanted to do.
[14:57.92]Which was start Yakuza.
[15:00.84]I have Yakuza and I have Until Dawn.
[15:03.12]That I have for PS4 games.
[15:04.44]But I guess it gets to a point where...
[15:13.96]There's just been, and you guys know as well as I do, there's been a lot of just technical issues with this stream.
[15:21.13]Time trial, don't get hit.
[15:27.15]What was that time trial even for?
[15:28.37]Did I just have to get to the end?
[15:31.56]I don't know, what did I do?
[15:39.34]I did it wrong.
[15:41.20]Okay, I guess I did that wrong.
[15:45.20]Can I go back and do that again?
[15:46.43]I don't think so.
[15:47.64]I fucked it up.
[15:56.15]Play Until Dawn?
[15:57.03]I want to.
[15:58.59]And I have another capture card.
[16:01.03]Regardless of how long it takes me to get this thing fixed, to get a new internal capture card, I have my old Elgato capture card just sitting in a fucking box.
[16:10.50]But guys, you know how much I fucking don't want to do that.
[16:13.78]I don't want to go into a fucking box that's packed up and pull out an old shitty fucking capture card that I thought I was done with forever.
[16:23.64]So that's the thing, that's what that- that's icing on top of the cake, right?
[16:26.62]You made me a fucking, like, you made me a Elgato dogshit birthday cake.
[16:31.72]And you put it in the fucking freezer.
[16:33.66]And you took it out, and you put it in the closet.
[16:35.46]And it was in there for like, you know, this is- I'm not even doing the analogy right.
[16:38.42]I started off a different way.
[16:39.72]Let's just put it this way.
[16:41.56]I don't want to have to, like, do- go into a fucking box and pull out an old shitty card, external, and do all the problems when I was supposed to- I was supposed to be gone to begin with.
[16:52.05]Time trial.
[16:52.65]Zero.
[16:52.95]I lost.
[17:00.26]But me knowing that putting an internal PCI capture card in this computer was supposed to solve all my issues, and it didn't solve any problems, I have to go dig the fucking Elgato out of a box.
[17:11.80]Like, tomorrow.
[17:13.46]Or Tuesday, whatever.
[17:14.20]It's like, fuck me.
[17:17.02]Like, I don't want to do that.
[17:18.61]But I have to.
[17:23.22]What about the PS4 feature?
[17:24.68]Yeah, but the PS4 feature, I can't, like... It's not at a high bitrate.
[17:29.51]It's not, like, high quality.
[17:32.53]I think there's, like, a big delay on it.
[17:34.07]The chat integration's not that great.
[17:35.91]Like, I have this fucking new computer to, like, stream these games now at, like, very good CPU presets, so they look good.
[17:44.99]There's a snake in the box?
[17:45.81]Whatever.
[17:48.37]Uh... Thank you, Zafandu, for the $15.00.
[17:53.17]And they say, I've been trying to say this all week, but I've somehow managed to miss all of your streams.
[17:58.13]My birthday just passed, and I wanted to say thank you for another year of laughs.
[18:01.73]You genuinely are my favorite streamer, YouTuber, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of what you have to offer.
[18:05.74]Thanks again.
[18:06.92]Hope your shit stuff's breaking.
[18:08.32]Love you, Jeremy.
[18:10.00]Well, thank you, Zafandu.
[18:13.34]Zafandu.
[18:15.50]I appreciate that.
[18:18.00]I'm just happy that you're happy.
[18:20.04]That makes me happy.
[18:21.12]It does.
[18:23.31]I know you probably hear people say that all the time.
[18:27.18]But I constantly want to better myself.
[18:31.04]And constantly want to better the streams and the videos and shit.
[18:33.99]That's like what keeps me alive.
[18:37.12]I would die.
[18:37.72]Like, I would just, like, turn... Okay, so, like, you know Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Three Kings?
[18:44.24]When, like, if Indiana Jones stops moving, he dies.
[18:48.29]He, like, just gets really old.
[18:49.39]Like, every time he, like, stops moving, like, he stays still.
[18:51.49]His skin gets, like, a little, like, more wrinkled and shit.
[18:54.27]And, like, if he stops moving for more than, like, 30 seconds, he's like... He dies.
[18:59.38]I don't want that to happen to me.
[19:10.63]Maybe it wasn't Indiana Jones.
[19:12.22]It was one of those movies with one of those fucking movies with the guy.
[19:16.26]It was Indiana Jones.
[19:18.96]Anyways, thank you.
[19:20.93]Froglock, thanks for the five bucks.
[19:25.06]Uh, even if things go wrong, sometimes we always appreciate what you do.
[19:28.46]Personally, man, you've helped me through so much crap in my life.
[19:30.58]Remember, Jerm or Rumble came out on some pretty heavy stuff.
[19:33.70]Nothing made me smile, laugh as much as that until I watched all of your Stardew Valley streams three times.
[19:39.56]I fucking love that game.
[19:41.40]But yeah, Froglock, like, uh... If you liked Jerm or Rumble Live, like, there's more of that shit is coming.
[19:48.15]More of that shit, I promise, will make its return.
[19:54.28]I promise.
[19:55.78]And hopefully it makes you as fucking happy as that video did.
[20:02.13]That would make me very happy.
[20:03.15]There's going to be a lot of people this summer working very hard to try to make that a reality.
[20:10.66]So, thank you.
[20:15.74]Live action or just live?
[20:18.26]Oh, live.
[20:19.14]Live action.
[20:20.34]There's going to be a lot of random shit.
[20:22.44]Actually, I was talking to one of my quote, quote, quote producers today.
[20:28.62]I saw him not that long ago.
[20:31.60]Ow.
[20:33.68]And we were talking about warehouse space, studio space.
[20:38.13]It's going to be the real deal.
[20:39.05]And I fucking just got to the exit.
[20:42.69]Good.
[20:45.04]A live, live action.
[20:46.54]That would be so much fun.
[20:48.68]That would be so funny.
[20:50.52]Like, you can't edit anything.
[20:51.72]Like, all the fucked up shit that happens just stays in.
[20:56.21]That's not to say that all the fucked up mistakes didn't stay in the first one.
[20:59.75]I, like, made sure of that.
[21:04.69]I made sure to make sure that... I made sure to make sure...
[21:09.69]Had a large amount of those, whoops, don't leave this in, but I don't give a fuck it's staying in moments.
[21:15.20]Those are like some of my favorite moments.
[21:18.60]A new gun?
[21:19.06]What is this?
[21:21.20]Oh, that thing sucks.
[21:23.42]Maybe the Hellsing pistol.
[21:25.11]That's fine.
[21:33.95]Livestream the film shoot?
[21:36.62]We could do something like that.
[21:38.22]Although, like, I don't want to give stuff away, like, too quick.
[21:42.19]I mean, like, the Jerma Rumble live action video was... No, I didn't really talk about it at all.
[21:51.03]Nobody knew that was going to happen.
[21:52.25]Like, I alluded to a few things, and I told... I did a couple of meetups at PAX's and, like, told people there.
[22:00.96]But I never, like, told everybody exactly what was going on.
[22:07.71]So I think I would like to probably keep it under wraps, like exactly when the video would be out, exactly what it would be.
[22:17.46]But just know that more things like that are going to be on the channel.
[22:22.61]I just hope it hasn't been like long enough on the main channel where people just fucking forgot that it existed and I get like 30 views.
[22:29.25]Oh, here comes like a huge video.
[22:30.93]It costs like $35,000.
[22:33.07]And it's like, whoops, I put it on the main channel.
[22:35.61]So it got like, everyone forgot about this channel.
[22:38.88]I can't take fucking 212 views.
[22:47.04]It's definitely been that long.
[22:48.28]No, I would make like a series of videos before it.
[22:51.12]Just being like, hey, remember me?
[22:53.96]Don't, are you still here?
[22:55.86]Alright, nice.
[22:58.29]See you soon!
[23:01.60]I wouldn't just throw that up there.
[23:03.40]I'd make sure that, like, those people still knew I was alive.
[23:08.14]Climb it, man.
[23:13.41]It's a pretty good place for the bats, I think.
[23:17.07]Yep.
[23:21.67]A lot of money.
[23:22.23]Thanks for the money.
[23:29.92]Hey, thank you FireAntTV and Jez42.
[23:32.68]That feeling when the funniest person on the internet has the same name as you.
[23:39.60]The funniest person on the internet!
[23:43.21]I don't know if... Can I like take that?
[23:45.29]Can I take that medal?
[23:47.35]I don't think I can.
[23:53.19]Mix in smaller skits with a bigger budget.
[23:56.48]With the big budget stuff to maintain an audience.
[23:59.86]Yeah, I mean, but here's the thing, though, like, I...
[24:05.84]I'm gonna say something that might sound weird coming from somebody that, like, makes fucking streams and videos and shit for a living, right?
[24:13.66]But, like, I... I don't, like, care about that stuff, like, I don't, like, necessarily care about... I gotta maintain, like, the influencer, gotta keep, like, the fucking viewers and the money going and I gotta keep everything... Hey, gotta stick around, guys, I'll see you on Tuesday for the next fucking shitty video that I put five minutes into.
[24:31.74]I don't, like, care about that.
[24:36.45]Like, hey, alright, yeah, I gotta keep, I gotta make, like, fucking seven videos a week, I gotta make, like, fucking two videos a week to keep, like, people, like... That stuff doesn't, like, make, that doesn't, like, make me happy.
[24:52.26]Tuesday, new video confirmed.
[24:53.70]I hope I'm, like, articulating what I mean here, by the way.
[25:00.63]Wait, when's the next shitty video coming out?
[25:04.35]Allows you to run backwards, that's good.
[25:11.37]Hey, gamers.
[25:13.89]Yeah, but the idea is you can keep the creative juices flowing without having to drain the bank.
[25:17.73]Well, I mean, look at what I do right now, though.
[25:20.27]So, like, twitch.tv right now is my, like... Throw my brain out on, like, a canvas and, like, just do and play and say whatever, right?
[25:31.02]Because if I wasn't streaming these games, I would be making videos on them.
[25:33.86]Like, I played Outlast and I beat Outlast.
[25:37.09]If I didn't stream Outlast, I would have just played Outlast and, like, probably done similar shit and made an Outlast video.
[25:46.57]But I streamed it.
[25:47.57]So, like, Twitch is now, like, my outlet for just throwing myself out there and just making content in quotes, I guess you could call it, right?
[25:57.62]I mean, yeah, I beat Outlast on stream.
[25:59.26]I did.
[26:02.04]Grandpa's Blunderbuss.
[26:03.14]Let's...
[26:06.07]This thing kind of sucks.
[26:07.41]Let's do this.
[26:12.05]Play total distortion on stream?
[26:13.25]I would probably do that, but that requires me to get it to run and fucking get captured, which as you're all aware, the last few weeks with doing the old Windows 98 shit,
[26:23.53]That's not easy to capture a lot of those games on stream.
[26:27.16]It just isn't.
[26:28.44]Unfortunately.
[26:29.20]I mean, I could try.
[26:31.02]But the headache that was, like, game show week and dinosaur week, some of those games were like ripping teeth out to get captured on OBS.
[26:49.29]And also, that's not to say that I want to, like, abandon my YouTube audience and abandon YouTube.
[26:53.77]No.
[26:54.01]I just... I care about... Because I can't do it every day, guys.
[27:03.55]That's the thing.
[27:04.23]Like, that's something... I try to articulate this sometimes.
[27:09.01]I can't do it every day.
[27:10.37]I can't... Put on, like... Like, the entertainer shtick thing.
[27:16.75]Like, I can't do that.
[27:18.86]So if I'm not in like a good headspace or if I'm not like feeling alright, if I'm not like feeling like I want to, you know, broadcast or make a video, I can't do it.
[27:27.92]I can't like fucking do that shit.
[27:30.76]Some people can.
[27:32.52]Some people can fucking put on a face every single fucking day.
[27:35.72]I can't do it.
[27:39.75]Even if I try, like I just can't do it.
[27:49.90]No, and I'm fine.
[27:51.26]Don't worry.
[27:53.24]Just point a shitty webcam at the stream.
[27:55.52]I'm gonna be fine.
[27:57.32]Don't worry about me.
[28:00.73]But some people can put it on every day and like stream or make a video every day.
[28:05.05]I'm not one of those people.
[28:08.81]I tried to do it for a while.
[28:10.13]You guys remember like the old fucking YouTube channel where I would like make, you know, five, four, five, six videos a day?
[28:18.89]No, no, wait, no, no, not a day, not a day.
[28:21.40]A week.
[28:26.04]Remember when I used to make five or six videos a fucking day?
[28:30.12]Ow!
[28:30.54]What is going on?
[28:31.22]Oh, the spikes.
[28:34.69]And plus, you know what you're getting into.
[28:36.57]Look at the title of the stream.
[28:41.75]Hey, Swiggity Stag.
[28:43.07]Thanks for the four bucks.
[28:45.74]You're going to college in Boston.
[28:47.18]You want to be best pals.
[28:48.92]Well, we already are best pals.
[28:50.64]So, I mean... I mean, that's kind of fucked up.
[28:54.09]I thought we already were.
[28:54.97]You're, like, telling me we are?
[28:55.93]Like, what's going on there?
[29:04.63]You'd rather wait for me to, like, be in a good mood?
[29:06.37]It's not necessarily good mood.
[29:09.82]It's just... I want to, like... I want to do something.
[29:15.73]It's why, like, I've never played the same game for more than fucking, like, three days.
[29:21.92]Oh, shit.
[29:22.60]This dumb thing is happening.
[29:24.20]The vessel's explored.
[29:26.06]Didn't even pay attention to that last thing.
[29:28.42]It's, like, it's why I don't play games for more than, like, two or three streams in a row.
[29:35.08]Because, like, I have, like, I constantly need to be, like, changing what I do.
[29:39.37]Otherwise I get bored.
[29:40.05]How do I get down there?
[29:50.69]easy and he played redneck for four streams well this was this particular stream was an unplanned immortal redneck stream I think when they said smallest kid videos I meant not every just once in a while make a smaller skippity yeah no I know it but
[30:21.27]I mean, my only rebuttal to that is like streaming has taken over that.
[30:26.62]Any time that I would have that I could give myself to like put into like videos, I'm streaming or I'm trying to get a stream ready or I'm trying to prepare for like the next stream or what am I going to do next time?
[30:37.68]Do I want to do like an elaborate fucking bit this next stream?
[30:41.56]And that, by the way, I'm going to.
[30:44.96]I'm going to very, very soon, you're going to see, like, another dumb, like, fucking live bit stream.
[30:49.64]Not bits as in, like, money, but bit as in, like, a fucking dumbass joke that I spend a bunch of money on.
[30:55.25]And I sit here and I do an IRL stream and I do it.
[30:57.33]That's happening, like, probably within the next, like, four days.
[31:04.83]But, like, when I used to do, like, videos once a week, I would, like, three or four days a week, I would do it.
[31:11.81]Like, that's what I would do.
[31:13.95]And streaming has taken that over.
[31:15.15]Streaming has done... Oh, that's a different gun I've never seen before.
[31:20.75]Or have I seen that gun?
[31:21.47]I think I have.
[31:25.99]No, it is not the clown car stream.
[31:27.63]I can tell you that for sure.
[31:29.05]I'll do that instead of the... We'll just use these just to get him out of the way.
[31:46.81]Am I going to pour banana milk?
[31:50.33]No, there's no more banana milk.
[31:57.76]Another rat sim.
[32:00.98]No, but this stream was not... This is not a planned stream.
[32:04.10]I was supposed to start Yakuza.
[32:07.01]And see how far we got with Yakuza over the next two or three streams.
[32:12.51]Obviously, we're not doing that.
[32:15.27]because my internal capture card is bricked for no fucking reason.
[32:24.61]I am gonna complain about it.
[32:25.93]You bet your bottom fucking dollar.
[32:37.39]Aha!
[32:38.53]Scroll, what is it?
[32:40.69]Jumping in the air will hurt you.
[32:41.98]Oh, that's great.
[32:43.50]That's only on double jumps though.
[32:47.97]What's the release schedule for the next Smite God breakdown video?
[32:51.13]Uh, well, who was the last Smite God?
[32:53.17]I don't even know.
[32:55.07]God, what a fucking disaster.
[32:57.49]What a fucking disaster.
[33:02.02]And you wonder why I never wanted to make a stream schedule.
[33:05.12]Because I made a video schedule, and like six days later, I like deleted the video and pretended I never made the video.
[33:15.32]Hey, Trevor, what happened to your video schedule?
[33:17.46]What are you talking about?
[33:18.26]I didn't do anything.
[33:26.47]Wait, I was supposed to make a Smite Sunday?
[33:29.75]How long was that going to last for?
[33:31.35]What a fucking idiot.
[33:35.13]Smite Sunday.
[33:39.06]And I didn't even realize it.
[33:40.18]You know, guys?
[33:41.60]Go back and watch, like, the Ares Smite Sunday.
[33:45.75]Or, like, the Anubis Smite Sunday.
[33:48.01]That god is fucking completely different.
[33:50.07]I did those videos in, like, the closed beta.
[33:54.55]All those god guides I made are totally fucking irrelevant.
[33:58.27]Not only that... What?
[34:06.56]What the fuck happened?
[34:12.62]We just did like 80 damage.
[34:15.00]Okay.
[34:19.64]Alright, well I'm dead.
[34:26.39]I think I'm going to try Redneck.
[34:29.49]Yeah, I gave up on Redneck.
[34:32.23]Let's give him a go and see how fun it is.
[34:39.00]Pyramid 2?
[34:39.54]Yeah, I'm going to do Pyramid 2.
[34:42.37]Let's just do... Oh, Toph.
[34:51.89]Is it?
[34:52.15]No, it's Toth, right?
[34:53.35]Toth.
[34:55.69]What does this require?
[34:56.47]Level 2 speed?
[34:57.51]Alright, let's get Toth.
[35:03.78]So, his activist transports you a short distance in the direction, so he has a teleport, and he has another jump.
[35:09.42]Eh.
[35:12.80]Eh.
[35:14.26]It's kind of lame.
[35:16.78]It's kind of lame.
[35:19.45]What about medallions?
[35:21.69]Increases attack and defense.
[35:22.85]Let's activate that one.
[35:23.87]Because this one is health, ammo, and gold picks up better.
[35:28.71]I don't like that one.
[35:29.67]I don't.
[35:32.38]What about these new ones?
[35:33.20]You start the first pyramid right after... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:34.88]You start the second pyramid right after the battle with... Okay.
[35:36.88]We're going to have to activate that one next time.
[35:47.95]This game is great.
[35:48.91]It is very good.
[35:55.76]How about the remade wild guns?
[35:58.40]There's a lot of shit that I want to do.
[36:00.08]And I was contemplating this for a while.
[36:04.70]And...
[36:08.68]I'm probably eventually here over the next... Not immediately, not right now.
[36:14.45]I got a lot of shit going on.
[36:16.35]There's a lot of shit going on right now in my personal life.
[36:19.45]That I'm obviously not going to touch upon or talk about.
[36:22.93]But there's a lot of things that are going on in my, quote, life.
[36:28.25]That I don't really want to do this right now.
[36:31.19]But in a couple of months, I would say.
[36:35.43]I think I want to add a day to my stream schedule.
[36:41.80]Because there's a lot of games that I want to play.
[36:43.79]There's, like, coming up.
[36:44.37]There's a lot of shit that I want to cover.
[36:45.71]And even if it was temporarily.
[36:50.77]Even if it was, like, a temporary thing for, like, a couple of months.
[36:53.43]Just to, like, you know, stay up to speed with all the new games.
[36:58.28]I would say, like, maybe, like, probably, like, a Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday type situation.
[37:03.72]Something like that.
[37:05.45]Because there's just so much to do, and I haven't been doing it.
[37:07.75]There's so many games that I want to fucking play.
[37:10.80]I have a rack of games that I want to do.
[37:13.54]By the way, I'm getting kind of destroyed right now.
[37:22.14]Let's do that.
[37:22.74]Mm-hmm.
[37:35.60]Okay.
[37:39.30]Racks on racks.
[37:40.76]Wait.
[37:41.44]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:44.86]These talking streams are always great.
[37:46.56]Sometimes you gotta do a talking stream.
[37:50.29]Really?
[37:50.75]That was not fair.
[37:54.53]I'm gonna go out and say that that shit just wasn't fair.
[38:01.45]Does RIPD count as a Western?
[38:04.05]I don't think so.
[38:07.69]Not that I'm aware.
[38:09.09]Oops.
[38:16.95]Get a JermaCraft month of streaming.
[38:19.59]Do they still update Minecraft?
[38:21.27]Is Minecraft still a video game?
[38:23.47]I know that Microsoft bought it for like $40 billion or something, right?
[38:27.93]Is that shit still going strong?
[38:46.77]His active, the redneck active, is very good.
[38:54.06]They do a lot.
[38:55.48]Thanks to modders, yes.
[38:56.48]I just find that so interesting.
[39:03.89]That game seriously just took off and still won't stop, huh?
[39:28.35]Really, don't.
[39:30.05]Okay, well that works.
[39:31.57]That's fine.
[39:38.94]JermaCraft really took off.
[39:40.30]No, it didn't.
[39:42.50]No, it didn't.
[39:43.98]JermaCraft did fucking terribly on my channel.
[39:50.49]I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[39:52.29]JermaCraft is like one of the fucking worst, like the worst performing video series on my whole channel.
[40:01.04]Timed Chaos Build was such a fucking million dollar idea.
[40:04.74]Don't even tell me it wasn't.
[40:07.94]I had that little series called Timed Chaos Build and it was a fucking billion dollar idea.
[40:14.63]And those were fun.
[40:19.21]Ah, fuck.
[40:20.69]Oh, hopefully these are good.
[40:21.53]Okay, that's good.
[40:26.28]That's not good.
[40:31.56]Mmm.
[40:35.26]I don't... Ah, no, I can't.
[40:37.26]This is too default good of a setup to get rid of right now.
[40:42.87]I liked those videos.
[40:45.87]Everyone grandpa invaded?
[40:47.13]I do.
[40:47.85]Let's go this way.
[40:51.91]Yes, I'm going to do Twitch integration for the next run.
[40:58.23]The next run will have Twitch integration.
[41:01.97]And it's probably going to happen really fucking soon.
[41:03.46]Because I just got rid of all my health to get those two shitty scrolls.
[41:13.28]Hold shift and you don't fall off.
[41:18.41]Wait, I wasn't holding shift?
[41:21.15]Really?
[41:23.22]Was I that bad at the game?
[41:28.86]Was I so bad at Minecraft that I didn't even know about the hold shift thing?
[41:38.82]Yeah, it'll be a 1-2-3 stream very soon.
[41:45.63]Unless somebody drops health here.
[41:46.81]No.
[41:47.53]Well, I just got slugged, so that ruins everything.
[41:49.51]Oh, I just really threaded the needle right there.
[41:54.16]I don't know how I'm still alive.
[42:01.44]Ruin him next run.
[42:02.58]Why?
[42:07.81]Could I donate you a dedicated streaming PC?
[42:09.87]It would include an international capture card.
[42:13.55]No, you don't... I appreciate that, but no, that's not necessary.
[42:18.97]I just got really extraordinarily fucking unlucky.
[42:24.45]My capture card that I bought... I'm dead.
[42:26.47]It's alright.
[42:26.85]It will ruin you and you can complain more.
[42:32.76]Alright, well, here's Toth.
[42:34.68]Might as well try him.
[42:37.80]Teleport and an additional jump.
[42:40.22]Not yet though.
[42:40.78]I want to turn on Twitch integration.
[42:43.76]There we go.
[42:44.50]Twitch integration is on.
[42:46.06]Welcome to the 1, 2, 3 stream.
[42:48.32]Let's try Toth.
[42:51.52]Hey, Adoric.
[42:52.82]Thank you for the $5.
[42:53.80]They say, how many bits to play Hollow Knight again?
[43:02.15]So this is just Zenyatta mode.
[43:03.35]This is actually pretty cool.
[43:08.44]How long is the recharge?
[43:09.36]It's pretty long.
[43:10.72]Oh, fucking sick.
[43:11.78]Zenyatta.
[43:12.42]It's actually not that bad.
[43:15.62]And what an energy rifle.
[43:17.56]How come I didn't see any of this shit when I'm like, what does this do?
[43:20.37]Like some floating disc?
[43:23.25]What the fuck?
[43:23.85]Okay, this guy's kind of cool.
[43:27.89]Hollow Knight.
[43:28.95]I don't know.
[43:31.93]I don't know.
[43:32.61]No amount of money.
[43:33.71]I'd have to just be into it.
[43:35.23]But thank you.
[43:37.76]Scrumpledunkers.
[43:38.54]By the way, that's one of my favorite games of the year.
[43:41.40]So don't think that I don't want to play it.
[43:44.34]Hollow Knight is, without a doubt, my favorite game.
[43:46.87]Like, one of the favorite games of the year so far.
[43:51.05]Also, SirFeline, thank you for the $5.
[43:53.19]This was a complaint stream.
[43:56.37]Oh, it is.
[43:57.34]It is.
[43:59.70]Thank you, though.
[44:01.22]But Scrumpledunkers, thank you for the $5.
[44:03.20]And then Scrumpledunkers again...
[44:06.15]No message, they just say, cheer, cheer, cheer.
[44:07.73]Okay, well, thanks a lot, man.
[44:15.40]I can't really afford any of these.
[44:16.48]I'll just get one of these.
[44:20.06]Alright.
[44:21.98]Do me good, Twitch chat.
[44:25.51]Have I ever gotten into XCOM?
[44:28.17]I have not.
[44:31.05]When will UQ's Zero be ready to stream Tuesday?
[44:34.68]It's ready to stream once I just dig out my old capture card and plug it in and deal with the nonsense of getting it installed and everything.
[44:43.24]Just a pain in the fucking ass.
[44:44.76]I have an internal capture card in this computer and it's bricked.
[44:47.47]It's just sitting in the PCI slot just doing nothing.
[44:50.81]Okay, well that's awesome.
[44:51.57]The weapons of your god have an attack bonus.
[44:55.01]You mean like this?
[44:57.09]That's pretty great.
[44:59.47]Okay, one, two, three.
[45:02.19]Here it goes.
[45:02.67]Good luck.
[45:10.30]Alright, let's do good.
[45:12.00]Do me a couple of favors.
[45:13.56]Do me a solid here.
[45:23.29]This is actually so great.
[45:24.31]It takes no ammo either.
[45:25.33]What about the energy rifle?
[45:26.71]How good is that?
[45:29.40]It's great.
[45:29.76]Okay, Toth is fucking awesome.
[45:39.20]Damage is really not even that bad.
[45:40.71]It's not great, but it's not bad either.
[45:43.11]I think I found the character I want to play with every time.
[45:55.66]These are all bad, aren't they?
[45:56.78]Except patrol speed's pretty good, isn't it?
[46:06.79]Damn, Toth, you are fucking awesome.
[46:15.70]This is such an awesome dog.
[46:17.10]What does this do?
[46:17.66]I just want to see what it does.
[46:21.17]It's like a little lightning cannon that hits anybody in the way.
[46:27.03]Yeah, so whatever the first upgrade for Toth is, I'm doing it immediately.
[46:31.71]Because he is fucking incredible.
[46:40.17]Lava and poison can't hurt you.
[46:41.67]Thank you so much, everybody.
[46:44.65]Thanks, everybody!
[46:50.71]Who's still alive?
[46:53.09]Who is still alive?
[46:54.99]This guy.
[47:02.92]Mmm, fruit here.
[47:13.31]Ay-yup.
[47:21.84]Mmm, throw another frisbee down here.
[47:32.15]Level 5 vegan, smart pocket, or hieroglyph master.
[47:35.31]Do not vote for hieroglyph master.
[47:38.35]The fucking worst thing ever.
[47:41.79]Why is it frozen?
[47:42.59]Uh-oh.
[47:44.58]Oh, there we go.
[47:52.50]Up here.
[47:56.54]No hieroglyph master.
[47:57.76]Don't do it.
[47:59.49]Don't you do it!
[48:01.09]Don't you do it!
[48:02.41]Don't you do it!
[48:03.99]Oh, you motherfuckers!
[48:06.01]Don't do it!
[48:07.43]No!
[48:08.39]No, quickly!
[48:09.11]Vote for Smart Pocket!
[48:10.17]I don't even know what Smart Pocket is!
[48:11.91]But it's not- Don't hieroglyph me!
[48:15.09]Not when I have, like, the greatest character!
[48:18.43]Oh, fuck!
[48:19.59]It's gonna be close!
[48:20.45]Don't do it!
[48:22.21]It's gonna be really fucking close!
[48:25.91]Oh, thank God!
[48:27.73]Thank God!
[48:30.74]Weapons will automatically relive- thank god!
[48:38.92]Hieroglyph master, like fucking get that shit out of here.
[48:44.70]I'm so glad my fucking jerbamites took over.
[48:50.32]Let's go down.
[48:57.46]Alright, Zenyatta.
[48:59.30]Let's do it.
[49:00.60]I will make that joke a hundred times, by the way.
[49:02.56]Not even a joke.
[49:03.18]This is an observation.
[49:04.10]That is an observation that's not a joke.
[49:19.71]Absolutely amazing character.
[49:33.75]Damn.
[49:38.03]Thank you again, by the way, Scrumbledunkus.
[49:40.15]I don't know if I caught you that second $2 bit donation.
[49:44.88]Thank you.
[49:47.88]Thank you very much.
[49:49.94]Appreciate that.
[49:51.66]Oh, thank you.
[49:54.31]Oh, lord.
[49:55.79]Don't blow up on me.
[50:07.35]It doesn't last very long, but it does a lot of damage.
[50:09.49]I feel like that could be really great at certain hallway encounters like this one.
[50:20.60]Vertigo sounds fun.
[50:21.56]I don't even know what it is.
[50:25.02]Use the rate of fire on your weapons.
[50:26.88]Hell yeah.
[50:30.27]Oh, fuck yeah.
[50:33.43]That is so awesome.
[50:41.51]This is going to be another one of those situations where it's going to be hard to lose.
[50:45.01]Unless you guys vote for Hieroglyph Master.
[50:47.32]Then I lose.
[50:49.94]That's a real quick way for this to go real south very quickly.
[50:53.52]Is for Hieroglyph Master to win.
[50:55.22]I'm going to have to make the call out.
[50:57.30]I'm going to blow the horn.
[50:58.16]I'm going to blow the horn to my Germalite.
[51:00.79]You know the call.
[51:01.83]You know how the horn goes.
[51:02.93]Here comes the call to the Germalite.
[51:10.89]That's the call.
[51:11.57]That's the Jervimite call.
[51:17.11]No hieroglyph Jervimites.
[51:20.99]Oh my god.
[51:21.75]I need to go to bed.
[51:24.50]Hold on.
[51:24.98]Hieroglyph Master is currently going to win.
[51:27.34]Excuse me.
[51:27.68]Fuck.
[51:27.84]I'm going to get hurt.
[51:29.66]Hold on.
[51:30.00]Come on.
[51:44.57]Beer.
[51:52.92]You heard him.
[51:56.84]Welcome to the magic show.
[51:58.82]No, that was Superman, actually.
[52:00.20]Sorry.
[52:01.76]Hey, Scrumbledunkus, again with 10 bucks.
[52:05.01]Thank you, Scrumbledunkus.
[52:06.95]No message, just Kappa 1000.
[52:09.29]Thank you.
[52:13.12]Wow, look at these fucking wonderful jermamites.
[52:16.74]This run is actually going to be very good if I don't fuck it up.
[52:20.28]Thank you, Scrumble.
[52:20.98]And also, Never Trust Purple, one of our resident mods and millionaires.
[52:25.07]1,000 bits, 10 bucks.
[52:27.95]Says, Jerma, it's Toth.
[52:29.91]T-H-O-F, Thoth.
[52:31.97]Like, as if you're going to say the T-H-O-F.
[52:34.54]Toth is a character from Avatar.
[52:36.84]Toth, The Last Airbender.
[52:39.80]Excuse me.
[52:41.98]Go open up Smite and click on Toth.
[52:47.24]And I determine how to pronounce a god's name by when you click on them and smite.
[52:54.81]Like Huyi.
[52:56.21]Huyi.
[52:57.75]Chunga.
[53:00.07]Toth.
[53:02.85]Sun Wukong.
[53:06.82]Anubis.
[53:11.52]This is fire.
[53:12.44]How am I not getting hit by this?
[53:18.49]Hooray!
[53:21.36]And a new weapon.
[53:22.30]Don't want it.
[53:23.78]All these are so good, I do not even fucking want that item.
[53:26.88]It's a cool shotgun.
[53:27.74]Pretty cool.
[53:28.20]Don't want it.
[53:36.67]Oh, watch out for the little dinie.
[53:43.77]Oh, I don't take fire damage.
[53:44.99]Right.
[53:45.19]Well, that makes sense.
[53:49.24]I just need to break all the pots.
[54:04.24]Gotcha.
[54:06.36]Gotcha.
[54:07.88]Freezing enemies too.
[54:08.90]Perfect.
[54:10.44]Hey, I hate fruit.
[54:11.24]Thanks for the $1.85.
[54:11.68]They just say they hate fruit.
[54:12.82]That's it.
[54:16.46]They're just making a statement.
[54:18.60]I hate fruit.
[54:21.13]Well, that doesn't seem like a great thing to hate.
[54:23.79]Why can't you hate, like, cigarette smoke?
[54:26.11]Come on.
[54:27.15]Fruit.
[54:27.45]How could you hate fruit?
[54:30.03]Blood Offering Metamorphosis Critical.
[54:33.39]Still haven't found the fucking thing.
[54:35.55]Scrumbledunkus again with $15.
[54:37.44]I am drunk.
[54:39.90]Please stop me.
[54:41.12]Well, I can't stop you, Scrumbledunkus.
[54:44.54]I can't stop you from giving me money.
[54:46.74]All I can say is, hey, you're drunk.
[54:48.46]Stop giving me money.
[54:52.26]You should be spending that, like, $15 on, like, a Taco Bell run.
[54:56.63]Have, like, your Uber driver, like, stop at Taco Bell on the way home.
[55:01.93]And get, you know, let's give some appreciation to our Uber drivers and Lyft drivers.
[55:06.83]Get him a Crunchwrap Supreme.
[55:09.33]I'm sure he'd appreciate it.
[55:18.23]No, he blew up, that's fine.
[55:26.67]Dammit, I took damage for the first time in like 12 minutes.
[55:32.56]Taco Bell sounds so good right now.
[55:34.26]Look, Taco Bell gets such a bad rap.
[55:37.24]Everybody talks shit about Taco Bell.
[55:38.88]Oh, Taco Bell, I'm gonna like shit my pants if I eat Taco Bell.
[55:41.64]Oh, I'm gonna have like bloody diarrhea when I go to Taco Bell.
[55:44.70]What the fuck?
[55:45.34]Shut up.
[55:46.98]What the fuck are you talking about?
[55:48.04]Taco Bell is awesome.
[55:52.84]Taco Bell is fucking awesome.
[55:55.26]I don't eat it all the time.
[55:56.26]Nobody does.
[55:57.78]Who eats Taco Bell like every day?
[55:59.60]No one.
[56:00.97]But when you go to Taco Bell, it's a magical experience.
[56:12.19]I kind of don't like this one, guys.
[56:16.74]You just hurt me.
[56:19.36]Okay, that one's alright.
[56:24.45]What if you don't like Mexican food?
[56:25.71]If you don't like Mexican food, that's fucking great.
[56:32.87]But I feel like Taco Bell gets more shit from people than McDonald's does.
[56:40.54]McDonald's gets a lot of shit, but people really lay into Taco Bell for some reason.
[56:48.33]Every Taco Bell I've ever been to has been, like, clean and, like, the workers have always been, like, really friendly.
[56:55.79]I don't know if it's, like, a Taco Bell thing, but, like, all, like, the people that I've ever, like, interacted with at a Taco Bell have been, like, extremely friendly and, like, help and very helpful.
[57:13.23]Do you get that at, like, fucking McDonald's?
[57:16.69]I don't know.
[57:17.09]Do you?
[57:24.70]Now I want a cheesy gordita crunch.
[57:26.38]What have you guys done to me?
[57:27.60]I can't get that right now.
[57:30.42]You've never had Taco Bell?
[57:34.31]It sucks.
[57:36.73]But it's good.
[57:40.21]You can't dog Taco Bell.
[57:45.27]Don't do it.
[57:46.05]Just don't do it.
[57:51.91]But, uh, Scrumbledunkus, that's it.
[57:54.43]You're done.
[57:55.77]That's it.
[57:56.41]No more money.
[57:57.63]You told me to stop you.
[57:59.01]That's it.
[58:01.53]Thank you for the ten bucks.
[58:02.33]And thank you, Dr. Fudge, as well.
[58:05.61]Luke, warm about fruit.
[58:11.34]Fruit's alright.
[58:14.36]Alright, I'm going to give it to you straight here, guys.
[58:15.86]You ready?
[58:17.32]Here's the lay of the land, the law of the stream.
[58:21.43]Like, don't agree, don't care.
[58:24.09]You know, don't agree, don't fucking care.
[58:25.75]This is the law of the land here.
[58:27.83]Taco Bell, Wendy's.
[58:32.07]Taco Bell, Wendy's, Burger King, McDonald's.
[58:37.58]In that order.
[58:39.78]Like, there you go.
[58:41.74]That's all you need to know for fast food.
[58:44.74]In that order for fast food chains.
[58:48.28]KFC?
[58:49.76]KFC's in the probably... I would put KFC above Burger King, below Wendy's.
[58:56.51]And all those places like Arby's and like Carl's Jr., I don't have those around here.
[59:00.85]So I can't give you a... Chick-fil-A, I don't have them around here.
[59:05.68]Taco Bell, Wendy's, KFC, Burger King, McDonald's.
[59:09.18]McDonald's is fucking awful.
[59:16.37]McDonald's, like, has a gray dog food meat.
[59:21.43]And look, I, I, I, I, like, will eat McDonald's.
[59:24.95]I'm just telling you.
[59:25.75]That's just the truth.
[59:37.14]Fuck you, Taco Bell's number one.
[59:39.10]Wendy's is number two.
[59:40.96]Okay?
[59:41.56]And look, if this is germacritic, if this is like metacritic, Taco Bell's like a 94 and like Wendy's is like a 92 and then KFC is like a 74.
[59:51.35]So don't worry.
[59:56.15]Burger King is like a 61.
[59:58.11]McDonald's is a 30.
[60:10.10]I've had Chick-fil-A before, but I can't give it a... I can't give it a... I can't put it on that list.
[60:17.39]For that list to exist, I have to have eaten at the restaurant, like, at least, like, 25 times.
[60:23.09]Which I have.
[60:24.31]All those places I have.
[60:25.57]Trust me, I have.
[60:28.90]I've eaten at Taco Bell probably, like, 150 times.
[60:31.72]Probably more.
[60:40.01]No, stop doing that!
[60:41.43]Stop fucking giving me blood offering!
[60:44.01]Oh god, you guys are trying to kill me!
[60:52.70]These are all great scrolls, but you guys are gonna fucking kill me.
[60:59.75]Watch it happen again, and I'm gonna die again.
[61:01.65]Oh, he's fine.
[61:05.93]Hey, Jimmy, help, thanks for the 20 bucks.

[61:30.99]He just, like, fucking made noise, right?
[61:32.65]That was, like, a sign, dude.
[61:34.85]Right before I said his name, he was like, yes!
[61:38.65]But thank you, uh... Thank you, Jimmy Help.
[61:41.95]Yeah.
[61:42.71]Special shout out to the bots.
[61:45.39]To keep this place... Uh... Keep this place... You know, keep the place clean.
[61:53.86]Sometimes it gets kind of dirty in here.
[61:57.80]I'm gonna die.
[61:58.77]I'm dead.
[61:59.71]It's over.
[62:01.23]Give me the meat!
[62:02.29]It's not over yet.
[62:02.91]What are you talking about?
[62:05.35]We're doing ultimate fucking electric frisbee, though, in like three or four places.
[62:11.21]At this point, we're just kind of spamming because I don't want to die.
[62:13.09]This room is hell.
[62:30.89]Didn't get hit.
[62:31.45]That's a good thing.
[62:35.91]Really?
[62:36.39]What is this tracking this guy has on me?
[62:49.15]Oh my god, and I'm sitting here having a fucking existential crisis, and I just got hit again That's so good.

[63:51.65]Like makeshift bowling balls.
[63:54.40]Well, thank you for the $5.
[63:55.92]These armadillos already are trained.
[63:58.80]I didn't have to do much.
[64:05.63]Well, I found the room.
[64:06.61]I just gotta be careful that I don't die.
[64:09.39]Can I frisbee this up there?
[64:12.87]Well, I kind of.
[64:14.13]But not really.

[66:05.92]A funny story.
[66:07.79]Grandpa's applesauce was the name of my finishing move in a backyard wrestling league I used to be in.
[66:13.31]When I was like fucking 12.
[66:14.33]I used to jump into a big swinging DDT and I would go, Here comes grandpa's applesauce!
[66:21.00]And I would jump into a swinging DDT.
[66:29.91]about fucking awful rooms, by the way.
[66:31.77]Like, give me a break.
[66:37.88]Like, this is the please lose room.
[66:50.73]There's nothing even here.
[66:52.89]Damn it.
[66:55.35]Wouldn't be awful if I had the frisbee, yeah.
[66:57.65]Or any of the other weapons I had.
[66:59.29]The pulse rifle would have been good there, too.
[67:03.31]Grandpa Tapasaurus would have been good there, too.
[67:14.12]I'm not upset about the kunai.
[67:15.88]I'm upset about everything else, though.
[67:20.04]Because those orbs were so fun to use and they were infinite ammo.
[67:24.70]Uzi and Kunai are two of the best weapons in the game.
[67:26.44]Yeah, but they weren't the cool energy ones.
[67:32.40]Kunai is fantastic, but it's not laser hands.
[67:39.23]Holy shit, this room.
[67:41.67]It's kind of insanity.
[67:47.31]We just ducked underneath that.
[67:55.68]It's okay, we're alright.
[68:00.90]Your attack increases as long as you don't miss a shot.
[68:03.66]Okay.
[68:06.16]Thank you, Twitter.TV chat.
[68:08.86]Appreciate it.
[68:10.08]You guys are doing a good job so far.
[68:14.34]Don't have much to complain about.
[68:23.42]Acrobat, the Martian, and a new beginning.
[68:28.66]Well, I fucked that up.
[68:39.67]That was annoying.
[68:46.29]Break everything and get the meat.
[68:49.25]Steal the meat from the meat factory.
[68:56.22]Such a great thing that you guys gave me here with the meat breaking.
[69:03.50]Lovely stuff.
[69:07.02]I want full health.
[69:09.32]Probably not gonna get it.
[69:14.58]It's okay.
[69:16.62]Aha!
[69:16.98]There we go.
[69:27.33]I am going to get full health.
[69:30.97]Nice.
[69:35.85]I'm going to be one of those freak shows that I'm going to break most of these.
[69:38.80]This is too many of them to ignore.
[69:40.62]Okay.
[69:46.74]Ow.
[70:04.06]Mmm, crit.
[70:05.00]Nice crit.
[70:14.37]Go away!
[70:15.01]Thank you.
[70:19.39]Two is the... Increases your attack in the air.
[70:21.75]Hell yeah.
[70:22.27]Two is the only answer.
[70:24.31]No.
[70:26.11]Scrubble Dunk is ten bucks again.
[70:29.45]My roommate can only stop me for so long.
[70:33.27]Alright, you make that sound like your roommate came in, saw what you were doing, and, like, duct-taped you to a chair in the other room.
[70:42.09]And then was like, look, man, I gotta go out to dinner.
[70:44.14]Like, you gotta stop giving this fucking shitty streamer money.
[70:47.18]And he, like, duct-tapes your hands, and you're like shit-faced, so you're like, what are you doing?
[70:50.42]No, I gotta get out of here and give him fucking ten bucks!
[70:53.60]And you're, like, locked in the chair for a small amount of time, and he left.
[70:57.86]And then you, like, broke out and, like, made it into the room and gave me ten more dollars.
[71:03.89]Well, there we go.
[71:06.09]Jeremiah, I drive a Malibu 985.
[71:08.35]What do you mean I drive a Malibu?
[71:15.43]But thank you.
[71:16.47]Thank you again, Scrumbledunkers, for the 10 bucks.
[71:21.36]If you could be an animal, which one would you be?
[71:23.60]Well, violated, I would be... I would be a bird.
[71:30.72]Wouldn't you guys be a bird?
[71:35.64]Because a bird, like, a bird you can just, you can fly.
[71:37.74]And you eat, like, fucking worms.
[71:41.36]Nobody bothers you.
[71:42.61]Nobody bothers a bird.
[71:44.17]You ever think about that?
[71:45.31]What are the predators for birds?
[71:47.19]If you're a gazelle, oh, I want to come back and be, like, a gazelle.
[71:50.19]Oh, yeah?
[71:50.83]Well, you're gonna get your fucking head ripped off by a tiger or a lion.
[71:54.29]Bad decision.
[71:56.56]I think I'd want to come back as a fox.
[71:58.88]Yeah?
[71:59.16]Well, you're gonna get, you're gonna get killed.
[72:01.22]You're gonna, like, fucking get eaten by, like, the buffalo.
[72:04.87]Nope.
[72:05.47]What fucking goes for a bird?
[72:08.43]Nobody.
[72:09.57]There's no bird predators.
[72:12.35]Good luck.
[72:18.73]Other birds?
[72:19.63]That's bullshit.
[72:21.01]That's like saying as a human that my, like, predator is like a big fat guy that can beat me up.
[72:29.70]Of course, I can't even hear myself talk.
[72:32.02]Hold on.
[72:40.55]Okay, anyways, I was gonna say, you saying that other birds are birds' prey is like me saying that another bigger human is my, like, a predator, like, my predator.
[72:51.64]So, a big scary guy is my prey, like, I'm his prey?
[72:55.60]No.
[72:56.60]I'm another fucking other human.
[72:59.14]There's a reason why that's saying birds of a feather flock together.
[73:03.86]No birds fucking prey on other birds, just like no humans prey on other humans.
[73:08.35]Oh, that's not true.
[73:10.07]There are like all terrible like human atrocities like every day.
[73:14.91]That's not what I'm trying.
[73:16.05]All I'm saying is like when you have your friends and you have like bros and like ladies and Western Pennsylvania is the most patriotic, God-fearing country in all of the United States.
[73:35.91]I got stuck there.
[73:37.99]Sorry.
[73:39.11]That's what you do when you get stuck.
[73:47.29]Nobody knows what that is.
[73:51.02]Inflict more damage.
[73:52.32]I've done that like four or five times over the last year and nobody fucking knows what that is.
[73:57.10]It makes me happy that nobody knows what I'm doing when I do that.
[74:02.88]Like, somebody, out of the 1,700 people that are here, somebody fucking thought that was funny.
[74:09.41]Somebody knows what that is, and, like, they get it.
[74:11.23]And they're like, okay, well, what the fuck?
[74:14.69]Somebody gave $100?
[74:15.63]What the fuck?
[74:16.29]Ashbringer gave $100.
[74:17.05]Hey, Jeremy, remember how I said I'd only give you half?
[74:22.98]Here's the rest of it, you filthy animal.
[74:24.92]Jeremy, comment.
[74:27.08]Holy shit, dude.
[74:29.73]Are you like, are you duct taped to a fucking chair too, like Scrumbledunkus?
[74:35.04]You're not his roommate, are you?
[74:39.48]But, yeah, that's... That's fucking, that's money, man.
[74:50.79]I won, I won, I get a hundred bucks.
[74:57.53]Thank you so much, dude.
[74:59.13]Like, this... Every time I get a hundred dollar fucking a ten thousand bit donation, I kind of have to just stop moving and I have to like kind of look at the ground because I'm just like, where am I?
[75:09.62]Am I even in reality?
[75:19.07]That was tight.
[75:19.75]That was tight.
[75:27.77]Chat, stop making this enjoyable for him.
[75:29.59]What are you talking about?
[75:31.85]Don't you want to see me beat the fucking... Stop swearing, too.
[75:35.23]Like, this is supposed to be a PG-14 stream.
[75:38.27]Can we talk about that for a second, by the way?
[75:39.70]Let's, like, go over that.
[75:40.40]Let's just very, very slowly go over this for a second.
[75:44.10]PG-13.
[75:44.34]Why 13?
[75:44.68]Why is it not 14? 13?
[75:55.56]What's... No.
[75:56.62]Like, I would say it would be, like, PG-14.
[76:00.16]At 13, I don't know if you should be seeing, like, you know... Those violent images that are in those PG-13 movies.
[76:10.10]Why is it not PG-12?
[76:10.74]Why 13?
[76:12.49]Seems like a very odd teenage number.
[76:21.13]You know what?
[76:21.45]Just censor it all.
[76:22.79]Censor it all.
[76:26.38]Nope, there should be no ratings.
[76:28.50]It should be, is this for a general audience?
[76:30.72]G. All your favorite movies should be, like, brought down to G. Censor them.
[76:36.55]I don't want my son to see that.
[76:39.01]I don't want to see that disgusting, that sexual imagery and violent imagery.
[76:44.91]I don't want to see that.
[76:46.07]But where are these two people?
[76:48.57]How the fuck do I get over here?
[76:51.46]Oh, God, no.
[76:52.54]No.
[76:57.17]He got out of the chair again.
[76:58.45]He got out of the chair.
[77:00.01]His roommate didn't use enough fucking horse glue or whatever he was keeping him tied down with.
[77:09.63]Oh, my God, Scrumbledongus.
[77:11.07]Thank you for the $100, the $105.
[77:12.39]He says, Jesus Christ, I promise I'm done now.
[77:13.53]Jerma, I love you.
[77:14.59]Keep being you.
[77:24.22]Alright man, like that's it.
[77:27.46]You were supposed to be cut off like 20 minutes ago.
[77:32.71]No one can stop them now.
[77:35.15]Just ban him so he stops giving money.
[77:37.01]No.
[77:42.85]Both Ashbringer and Scrumbledunkers, both you guys have been the financial super team this stream.
[77:53.27]Stop, he's drunk.
[77:56.71]Thanks for the let me breathe, by the way.
[78:01.99]But yeah, no more money.
[78:03.90]Just sit and watch.
[78:04.68]This one's for you.
[78:06.00]Just sit here and watch this.
[78:10.34]How do I get in here?
[78:12.86]Oh, he found it.
[78:13.86]The dumb mouse found the end of the maze.
[78:17.49]He found the cheese, guys.
[78:19.99]I found the cheese.
[78:25.19]Payday.
[78:26.47]I kind of like the idea of payday.
[78:29.75]I kind of like the way it sounds.
[78:30.83]It sounds good.
[78:32.77]Does that mean it actually is good though?
[78:34.65]I don't know.
[78:37.71]Payday.
[78:38.21]That's donate to Jerma by pressing 2.
[78:39.99]Alright, get me out of here before I fucking throw up.
[78:44.34]Get me out of here before I puke.
[78:49.72]Let's talk about that for a second.
[78:50.72]Can I bring that up for a second?
[78:51.76]What's with puke?
[78:52.98]Why do we puke?
[78:55.60]Shouldn't be puke.
[78:56.50]Shouldn't puke.
[79:00.02]Ah, this is chess.
[79:00.80]I get it.
[79:01.12]Already got it.
[79:07.71]Let's go.
[79:14.09]I didn't already get it.
[79:14.83]It's right here.
[79:18.79]More money and more meat.
[79:20.53]And where do we go?
[79:22.47]Gotta go up, right, left.
[79:24.45]Got it.
[79:28.58]Is a hot dog also a sandwich?
[79:29.96]No, it's not.
[79:30.64]It's its own thing.
[79:32.48]I will fight you.
[79:33.00]I will fight you about that all day, by the way.
[79:35.13]Hot dog is not a sandwich.
[79:38.53]It's its own genre of food.
[79:41.73]You know how I know that?
[79:42.59]You know how I can tell you that?
[79:45.81]Name me another penis-shaped food.
[79:48.70]You can't do it.
[79:50.54]He's talking about a sandwich.
[79:51.36]Sandwiches is... There's no penis... There's no penis... There's no...
[80:01.14]Cucumber, banana, sausage, like, people just name it.
[80:06.08]Corn, eggplant.
[80:11.34]Yeah, I'm not sure where I was going.
[80:16.98]Increases the gold pickup.
[80:18.44]Nice.
[80:21.69]I like, I like tired Jerma.
[80:27.31]I mean, I'm tired, but I'm not that tired.
[80:32.84]That little lasagna.
[80:34.70]Lasagna is not, not shaped like that symbol that we don't talk about because censored this stream.
[80:45.30]Oh shit.
[80:46.27]God damn it.
[80:57.89]Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat.
[81:03.60]Nice.
[81:05.18]Get that turkey.
[81:07.00]I turned the turkey into a chicken.
[81:10.53]And then I shot the chicken in the head.
[81:13.71]Happy Thanksgiving.
[81:20.49]Any more money?
[81:26.60]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[81:28.12]What is blindfolded?
[81:29.10]No, no.
[81:29.92]Neither one of those.
[81:30.46]What's coward?
[81:33.86]No, I need my crosshair.
[81:35.10]I need my crosshair.
[81:36.18]At this point, I don't care if you vote for hieroglyph.
[81:37.90]What is coward, though?
[81:46.31]I would rather have my crosshair than the hieroglyph thing.
[81:50.71]Who cares right now?
[81:52.07]I already know what I have.
[81:54.81]And plus, I can see it in the chat anyways.
[81:56.23]Just fucking vote three.
[81:57.17]Who cares?
[82:05.90]Oh, dig dog.
[82:07.12]Oh, I'm so fucking sorry that I'm being a yawn man.
[82:11.03]I really shouldn't be.
[82:24.19]Oh, that helped.
[82:32.51]You know, I'm gonna pick this up just to shoot this once.
[82:35.83]And I'm gonna leave it.
[82:37.37]Okay.
[82:37.91]That was fun.
[82:41.31]Game font changes.
[82:42.06]That doesn't matter, because now I can just look over and see.
[82:46.42]I can just cheat by reading chat.
[82:48.90]So it's okay.
[82:51.14]Plus, I know you guys are gonna vote for accuracy, so who cares?
[82:54.28]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[82:56.08]Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
[82:58.26]Wait a second.

[83:09.33]I thought you were done!
[83:11.09]You just- you came for 50 more dollars?
[83:14.23]Holy shit, dude.
[83:17.45]I've been watching you for five years, I guess I'm finally paying my dues.
[83:22.55]No, you don't owe me anything.
[83:25.99]You don't owe me a damn thing, man.
[83:29.14]Like, thank you so much.
[83:31.64]You don't owe me anything.
[83:34.57]I hope none of you feel like that.
[83:38.81]Where's the... Where's the door?
[83:43.11]Why am I lost?
[83:47.71]No, here we go.
[83:51.81]I don't want to go that way.
[83:52.65]I want to go over here.
[83:57.82]He will starve because of this.
[84:02.94]Scrumbledunkus is a great name.
[84:04.70]It is a great name.
[84:07.12]Scrumbledunkus.
[84:09.60]Well, I hope you have a great, great evening, Scrumbledunkus.
[84:17.59]And yes, I will take your vast amount of money if you don't want it.
[84:22.69]I hope you don't want it.
[84:23.83]I hope you don't need it.
[84:26.31]But thank you so much for your extreme generosity.
[84:31.29]And also in that whole fray there, MooMeansMoo gave $15.
[84:34.43]Dermot, stop being so crude.
[84:37.05]Think of the children.
[84:38.57]Also, I need to work at 7 tomorrow and need to sleep.

[84:42.27]You got it.
[84:42.74]This is from MooMeansMoo just so you can get some sleep.
[84:47.38]I'll do it in a second when I clear this room.
[84:51.68]Just so you can get a little bit of rest, you know?
[84:58.87]This room is kind of insane.
[85:00.19]What does this do?
[85:04.90]You can't remain still.
[85:05.92]Oh, this dumb thing again.
[85:07.10]Whatever.
[85:07.44]I hate this one the most.
[85:12.52]I should have told you guys I hated this the most.
[85:15.64]No, what am I doing?
[85:16.22]I should have told you guys I love this or something so no one would pick it.
[85:20.61]What is that?
[85:23.87]What the fuck is this?
[85:26.19]Ra's Staff.
[85:29.20]Uh, I think I want this.
[85:34.20]Yeah, I do want this.
[85:41.57]This thing's kind of cool.
[85:42.55]Alright, so here's... I can't... I have to, like, stay still.

[85:55.62]Okay.
[85:57.88]Okay.
[85:59.47]What I'd like for you to do is just lean back in your chair, count to ten, and relax.
[86:07.81]Think about the day.
[86:10.81]What did you do today?
[86:13.17]What did you do this afternoon?
[86:14.39]What did you have for breakfast?
[86:17.83]A burrito with cheese and eggs?
[86:22.04]Should I speak up?
[86:23.96]Wait, what?
[86:26.52]So,
[86:30.61]What you need to be doing is slowly drift back from 10.
[86:35.41]And when you get to zero, you're going to be in a deep sleep.
[86:39.66]10, 9, 8, 7, Jorah Mormon, ASMR.
[86:46.84]What you need... 6, 5, 4, 3, 2... I can't fucking get over that, man.
[86:56.01]Why did I look at chat?
[86:56.91]I was going to do something funny.
[87:14.10]I saw something fucking crazy, and it's making me fucking laugh.
[87:20.55]Oh, God.
[87:21.21]Okay, let's go.
[87:22.69]What are these, brass knuckles?
[87:24.35]Thanks for the brass knuckles.
[87:28.47]Holy fuck, I can't even think.
[87:35.60]I was gonna scream in the mic at zero like but like I somebody said Jorah Mormon ASMR and I fucking can't even do it anymore I need you to count back from ten Khaleesi I need you to count back from ten
[88:05.04]There was other things too that people were saying that was... Jesus Christ.
[88:12.88]Oh my god.
[88:14.21]Everything is funny to me.
[88:15.53]I'm at that stage where I'm just very tired and everything is funny.
[88:18.03]Doesn't matter what it is.
[88:21.81]But I was gonna, at zero, I was gonna scream as loud as I could in the mic.
[88:27.31]I was gonna hurt everybody's ears and now I can't do that shit.
[88:30.54]That's not nice.
[88:35.09]I hate this not stop moving thing.
[88:37.00]It's the worst.
[88:42.06]Thoroughly aroused.
[88:43.20]What?
[88:58.78]I'm just thinking of the fucking thing I saw.
[89:03.63]I can't fucking stop man.
[89:10.66]What the fuck?
[89:19.72]Some of you guys are fucking hilarious.
[89:24.10]Seriously.
[89:26.62]I love- and people say like, oh, fuck chat.
[89:31.08]Like, fuck chat, chat sucks.
[89:32.76]No, chat is fucking awesome, man.
[89:34.46]Like, some of you guys say the funniest fucking goddamn things ever.
[89:42.01]Some of you guys are real, like, A plus, grade A, FCC regulated meat.
[89:47.99]What?
[89:49.45]What is this fucking potion?
[89:51.65]Oh!
[89:53.52]It's a mana and health potion.
[90:03.70]I fucking hate it.
[90:04.52]Why did you guys give me the scroll that makes me not stop moving?
[90:07.29]No matter what.
[90:07.89]I hate it.
[90:09.07]More than anything.
[90:12.05]I fucking hate it.
[90:13.25]I can't even play.
[90:19.30]I can't play like this.
[90:21.04]It's so awful.
[90:22.78]It's so unfun.
[90:24.10]This is the antithesis of fun.
[90:31.05]Oh, it gives me a headache just doing it.
[90:32.85]Get out of here.
[90:33.49]Go quick.
[90:34.37]I want to die.
[90:34.91]I'm going to die intentionally to get rid of this.
[90:54.00]I don't know why I was just gonna laugh.
[90:55.24]I was gonna say, oh, King Tut's gonna be real mad about that one.
[90:58.03]Because I, like, broke a bunch of vases.
[91:01.05]Like, that's not even funny.
[91:03.25]It's only funny because it's fucking, like, late and I haven't slept in a while.
[91:09.78]How do I get out of here?
[91:14.70]Give me that.
[91:19.10]Oh, my God.
[91:21.70]It's up there.
[91:27.73]Go on.
[91:31.83]And the wait what threw me off too.
[91:33.31]I'm like going and creeping up and like whispering and all of a sudden I hear wait what in my ear.
[91:50.65]Uzi is so good.
[91:52.57]It's incredible.
[91:58.80]Let's just beam down this hallway.
[92:00.04]Does this thing burn out?
[92:08.35]I wish I knew how much ammo is in here.
[92:12.69]Come on guys, be mean for once.
[92:14.19]Why do you want to be mean for once?
[92:15.77]Can run backwards?
[92:16.57]No.
[92:17.65]Well, that's okay because I'm constantly going to be running backwards regardless because I'm always moving.
[92:24.16]Because I have the worst scroll in the game on.
[92:26.50]The constantly moving is the worst scroll in the whole game.
[92:29.50]I'd rather have the exploding vases.
[92:46.19]I'm lucky I have this because I can just be moving in every direction and still get kills.
[92:51.20]It's lovable.
[92:53.14]It's so lovable.
[93:01.41]How much money do I even... I can't even tell.
[93:02.85]Why would I even... Why would I ask such a stupid question?
[93:05.81]How much money do I have?
[93:07.11]I don't know.
[93:07.87]Because I can't see it.
[93:08.71]I'll take that, though.
[93:15.77]Thank you.
[93:18.55]I think this is the first boss, right?
[93:20.05]The little mini-boss.
[93:23.07]I'm probably gonna die.
[93:26.13]Yep, here we go.
[93:30.35]Skip it.
[93:32.43]And just burn him.
[93:45.53]Yeah, Matt!
[94:04.52]Oh, I fucking- this constantly moving thing sucks!
[94:11.40]Oh my god!
[94:12.34]I can't- I just have to constantly be fucking moving!
[94:17.26]And you just run into everything!
[94:23.06]I told you I should've just fucking ended the goddamn run!
[94:29.05]It's impossible to play with that on!
[94:32.91]That scroll is impossible to play the game when it's on.
[94:36.71]Especially when the ground has lasers all over it.
[94:47.80]Like, what the fuck?
[94:56.21]It's not over.
[94:57.17]Who said it was over?
[95:03.12]Buy the mini boss medallion and you'll teleport to that spot.
[95:05.42]That's what I'm going to do.
[95:13.44]Scrumbledunkus again with 20 bucks.
[95:15.44]I've given you $400 CAD.
[95:19.52]I will hate myself in the morning, but I love you.
[95:22.72]Scrumble.
[95:25.28]Alright, Scrumble.
[95:27.36]Scrumble, ban him.
[95:31.01]I can't, look, I can't ban him.
[95:35.46]You've given me a lot of money.
[95:38.24]Like, hopefully you don't open your wallet in the morning.
[95:40.22]And like a little fly, like a little bee flies out of it.
[95:43.96]What was that?
[95:44.64]What's that about, by the way?
[95:46.84]Can we talk about that for a second?
[95:49.28]What's with like old cartoons and old movies and stuff?
[95:51.44]When somebody opened up their wallet, a bug flies out of it.
[95:54.26]Like a little gnat flies out.
[95:55.97]Why would there be a bug in your wallet in the first place?
[95:59.35]Number one, why would it still be alive?
[96:00.67]If it was in your pocket...
[96:02.72]You would be dead.
[96:03.46]The bug would be crushed.
[96:05.43]How is it flying out?
[96:06.85]And what does that even mean?
[96:08.81]What was in that wallet?
[96:12.93]It's a moth?
[96:13.53]Why would they... You would crush the moth if you closed the wallet.
[96:19.45]By the way, wallets.
[96:20.19]Can we talk about this for a second?
[96:21.13]Can we just talk about this for a second?
[96:22.57]Wallets?
[96:24.68]Why do they make it... Let's just discuss this for just a minute.
[96:28.84]Wallets...
[96:30.87]They're too big.
[96:32.43]We need smaller wallets.
[96:51.97]I love how fucking irritated some people are getting about that.
[96:55.75]Anyways, thank you, Scrumple.
[96:57.07]Hopefully you're not wasting all your money.
[96:59.33]Also, Spider-Man.
[97:01.59]Okay, I get it now.
[97:03.56]Spider-Man makes the $1,500.
[97:04.44]$1,500.
[97:04.46]$1,500.
[97:04.48]$1,500.
[97:04.50]$1,500.
[97:04.52]Okay, let me buy this stupid fucking thing.
[97:24.75]And one of these.
[97:26.75]Do I not get a medallion?
[97:27.79]Nah.
[97:35.19]And... How about... More health.
[97:43.08]And... With that expensive?
[97:45.20]No, damn.
[97:46.28]Can't do anything else.
[97:52.10]Am I really going to throw $1,100 in the trash?
[97:58.18]No, I'm going to have to buy one of these too.
[98:03.97]Get them both.
[98:05.03]Okay.
[98:08.33]Anyways.
[98:10.47]Thank you.
[98:14.29]Thank you.
[98:16.45]for the 20 bucks crumble.
[98:17.76]Thank you also, Spider-Man, for the $15.
[98:19.02]Danger Illustrated for the five bucks.
[98:21.74]Sometimes when I'm trying to sleep, I hear the critters are under attack over and over in my mind until I can't maintain consciousness anymore.
[98:31.40]Well, that's, um... That's... Yeah, that did happen a lot, didn't it?
[98:39.43]Wait, what am I doing?
[98:41.68]The critics are under attack.
[98:43.18]Why was that guy fucking... I'm in New York.
[98:45.18]It's really odd.
[98:47.46]But thank you.
[98:48.36]Also, Scrumble.
[98:50.02]Not Scrumble.
[98:51.53]Spider-Man.
[98:51.95]I want to read their text here.
[98:56.97]They say, Love you, Jeremiah.
[98:58.79]You're one of the funniest and kindest dudes around and got me through tough times.
[99:01.69]Keep it up, dude.
[99:02.19]Well, thank you, Spider-Man.
[99:04.34]For the $1,500, apparently.
[99:05.86]And I don't know why I thought that was so funny.
[99:07.42]I'm just like over... I'm overtired right now.
[99:11.76]I do apologize for my like insanity but let me switch this for a second just so I can scroll down uh so says corey thanks for the seven dollars I have ten fingers still I don't know what happened to the uh the last the other one so I don't know but uh thank you corey for the seven bucks
[99:33.26]Moo means moo.
[99:33.82]Thanks for the five dollars.
[99:34.58]Alright, I need to go to bed before my mom gets pissed at my credit card bills again.
[99:38.69]Thanks for always holding such incredibly entertaining streams.
[99:41.41]And you know, I couldn't agree with them more.
[99:43.81]See?
[99:44.59]Somebody gets it.
[99:45.79]Moo means moo gets it.
[99:48.73]He understands that joke.
[99:54.82]That makes me happy.
[99:55.64]Thanks a lot, man.
[99:56.24]Have a good night.
[99:57.34]Thanks for the five bucks.
[99:58.08]Thanks for the multiple, multiple money that you've given me tonight.
[100:01.86]Thank you.
[100:03.76]Also, Kuzon23 gave $10 a few minutes ago.
[100:09.42]Hey man, just got back from a party and I'm still a little drunk.
[100:11.60]Love you, man.
[100:12.18]I love you too, but no more drunk spending.
[100:16.65]No more drunk spending.
[100:18.89]Kuzon, I'm not sure you're aware of this, but we got a drunk spender in the chat right now.
[100:24.53]So, thank you though.
[100:29.03]Let me move this.
[100:31.43]Okay, back to it.
[100:32.94]Should teleport right to the boss, right?
[100:37.58]Western Pennsylvania is the most God-loving, wonderful, God-fearing part of America.
[100:46.08]Lots of little drunk people.
[100:46.92]That's Saturday night, man.
[100:50.54]Fast fingers.
[100:51.14]Where did this come from?
[100:53.10]What?
[100:53.26]Okay.
[100:54.00]Let's see if I can beat this boss.
[101:04.41]Is the Samurai Jack... The new Samurai Jack is incredible, right?
[101:08.07]From what I understand.
[101:20.23]That was terrible.
[101:26.21]Although, I like this medallion because it skips you right to the floor with the boss.
[101:32.53]But I'm not sure if I like it that much because you miss out on all the scrolls that you would get from the whole tower.
[101:39.49]So I guess you're giving your take in that sense.
[101:44.39]I missed that.
[101:53.92]Reload this.
[101:58.27]Quote tower it is a tower Oh Jesus that's not gonna be good.
[102:09.69]This is not gonna be good.
[102:10.83]I'm dead Okay, well Can't afford to do that again
[102:34.42]Let's go.
[102:38.26]That was an insta-game.
[102:39.60]There was way too many of those blowfish.
[102:44.00]At least we got Toth.
[102:45.96]The best character in the game.
[102:51.28]Toth.
[102:55.51]Up the stairs.
[102:56.45]Okay, Toa of Yordick.
[102:59.63]Everybody listen to me.
[103:22.75]But, yeah, my general consensus on this video game, I said it last time when I streamed it.
[103:29.75]This is very good.
[103:32.21]It's very clean.
[103:33.51]It's a very polished game.
[103:36.51]All the guns feel fun to use.
[103:40.98]Even though it's an indie game, it's very polished.
[103:45.04]And it's fun, too.
[103:46.48]And there's upgrades.
[103:47.12]I'm a sucker for games with upgrades.
[103:54.49]Persistent upgrades like that.
[103:55.79]It's just fun to play around and like which one I what do I want to do first this room again?
[103:59.67]It's the fucking same room.
[104:00.91]What the fuck?
[104:06.92]It's the same room with these puffer exploding puffer fish look at that.
[104:10.26]I'm dead again Goddamn
[104:37.10]Why did you guys do that?
[104:40.34]What was the point of that?
[104:41.20]I just have to do all that again.
[104:45.37]And I still have... I have like 54 health.
[105:01.73]Jesus alright, we're just doing he's doing frisbee electricity everywhere I'm dead
[105:26.87]I don't think I can just jump.
[105:29.11]My characters are not leveled up enough.
[105:33.36]I can't just jump into those.
[105:34.78]I just die too quickly.
[105:35.54]I don't have enough scrolls.
[105:40.80]Jumping right into the middle of the pyramid without any scrolls is guaranteed death on the second pyramid at this stage for me.
[105:48.22]I gotta go from the beginning.
[105:50.70]That's like a later on when my characters are better.
[105:59.20]You must win.
[106:00.08]I think you violated for the five bucks.
[106:03.22]It says, Dad will beat me for this.
[106:08.08]What?
[106:10.32]Well, I hope not.
[106:16.07]Thank you for the five dollars, though.
[106:27.57]Yeah, you gotta start from the beginning so I can get some scrolls.
[106:36.74]I'm glad I get to play as Apis again, though, because I can do this.
[106:41.07]The invulnerability is so... It's just such a... It just helps me out.
[106:47.53]I say that now and, like, I'm gonna die.
[106:56.41]I'm not sure if I've reached the point where I'm too tired to do this.
[106:58.49]I don't think so.
[107:01.07]I think I'm still good for a little while.
[107:21.74]Don't kill me.
[107:27.26]Shield, payday, emergency landing.
[107:29.56]Thank God it's not going to be emergency landing, because that sucks too.
[107:42.42]Not low ammo for long.
[107:46.53]Hey, thanks for the defense.
[107:48.23]Reminds me a lot of Serious Sam.
[107:50.27]Yeah, it does.
[108:09.08]I forgot Apis can't double jump.
[108:12.74]I forgot.
[108:19.93]Don't need it.
[108:21.79]I'd like to have it, though.
[108:26.25]Oh, come on.
[108:26.83]Really?
[108:31.90]Oh, stop raining hell on me.
[108:42.84]Oh, fuck it.
[108:49.75]That was necessary.
[108:56.03]Y'all know it.
[109:05.74]Oh, what?
[109:06.83]Oh.
[109:13.72]I'm okay.
[109:15.08]I am going to replace one of these, though.
[109:16.52]I do want to keep this.
[109:17.34]I'm going to replace this with that.
[109:20.42]Sure thing.
[109:21.24]Absolutely, let's keep moving.
[109:34.37]Crazy robin.
[109:36.69]Thanks for the troll's feet.
[109:46.50]These guys get right up in your grill.
[109:50.82]I just said grill unironically, didn't I?
[109:55.33]I did.
[109:56.61]I just did.
[109:58.39]I'm so sorry.
[110:01.07]You know, like, I was saying that, and as I was saying it, I was saying, don't say it, and I said it.
[110:08.64]Let's reload this.
[110:10.58]Get it loaded up.
[110:15.11]Unironic grill.
[110:16.49]I know.
[110:18.49]Here's the floor where we can leave.
[110:23.50]And you just appeared in front of me.
[110:35.32]You still didn't explode?
[110:40.37]Of course you didn't.
[110:43.15]Why would you?
[110:57.56]Who's left?
[111:06.79]Where is this guy?
[111:10.31]Here he comes.
[111:13.89]There's two of them?
[111:15.68]I guess so.
[111:24.92]Let me move.
[111:27.14]Proves your attack.
[111:27.76]There we go.
[111:28.30]Thank you.
[111:31.16]Did the Germans start making jokes?
[111:33.72]Uh-oh.
[111:34.74]I gotta start making jokes.
[111:35.64]You're right.
[111:35.94]Uh, hold on.
[111:41.77]I gotta make some good jokes.
[111:44.55]I'm so sorry.
[111:46.93]Hold on a second.
[111:52.55]Okay.
[111:52.79]Okay.
[111:56.69]That's a good, like, clean joke.
[112:00.84]Okay, so.
[112:06.94]So, a teacher is talking to her students.
[112:12.04]And she said, kids, what does the chicken give you?
[112:15.68]And one of the students says, meat.
[112:17.42]The teacher says, very good.
[112:19.40]Now, what does the pig give you?
[112:21.26]Somebody else yells out, bacon.
[112:22.85]Bacon.
[112:24.80]And then the teacher says, Great!
[112:27.00]What does the fat cow give you?
[112:28.96]And they all scream, Homework!
[112:37.34]Actually, he's kind of funny.
[112:45.13]That was kind of funny, actually.
[112:48.87]It was a good, clean joke.
[112:56.89]Thanks for the troll's feet.
[113:04.70]God damn it.
[113:08.84]I hit right at the shitty moon tattoo.
[113:12.06]Oh my god.
[113:13.04]Fuck me.
[113:15.56]Can I please?
[113:16.80]Will I ever learn?
[113:25.00]Hey, thanks for the Mr. Wayne.
[113:28.79]How the fuck do I... Give me this.
[113:49.07]Like, really?
[113:49.47]I don't know how to get back up here.
[113:50.71]Did I miss a place to get up?
[113:54.76]No, right here.
[114:01.42]This is annoying.
[114:08.09]How annoying.
[114:19.72]No, I'm looking right now.
[114:21.56]Caution, wet floor wins.
[114:22.74]I'm going to be very upset.
[114:24.78]Do not vote for that garbage fucking scroll, please.
[114:28.85]Please, God.
[114:30.95]Hey, Gummy Monk, thank you for the $5.
[114:34.25]What's with the weird stream times?
[114:35.98]First, I was at work, and now this.
[114:38.50]What happened, man?
[114:40.28]A lot of things happened.
[114:41.18]A lot of weird shit going on.
[114:44.90]I had computer problems again today.
[114:47.74]Not cool.
[114:49.52]So that's why we're doing a late night stream.
[114:53.96]I'm hoping it'll be squared away completely.
[114:58.58]Bye!
[114:59.86]Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly!
[115:01.36]Okay, I'm good.
[115:05.11]I'm gonna put it squared away by Tuesday.
[115:06.71]I really do.
[115:08.79]It should be.
[115:09.43]No, it will be.
[115:10.05]I just have to get my other capture card.
[115:13.53]Don't worry.
[115:14.01]Everything's gonna be fine.
[115:17.90]Uh, what are they?
[115:18.28]Time for another clean joke?
[115:20.68]Yeah, yeah.
[115:23.34]Clean jokes.
[115:26.77]Okay, another clean joke.
[115:31.46]I'll give it to you after I beat this room.
[115:42.48]I hate needing to find the one little spot to go down like here.
[116:01.64]Okay, so, a child asked his father, how were people born?
[116:08.85]So his father said, Adam and Eve made babies, and then their babies become adults and made babies, and so on.
[116:15.56]The child went to his mother, asked her the same question, and she told him, we were monkeys, and then we evolved and we became like we are now.
[116:24.03]The child ran back to his father and said, You lied to me.
[116:27.61]His father replied, No, your mom was talking about her side of the family.
[116:31.97]That's a clean joke for you.
[116:39.06]Let's do another one.
[116:50.95]My friend thinks he's so smart.
[116:53.09]Can I tell you that, guys?
[116:54.71]My friend thinks he is so smart.
[116:58.07]He told me an onion is the only food that makes you cry, so I threw a coconut at his face.
[117:02.51]Okay.
[117:10.98]We're doing clean jokes.
[117:13.84]Hey, what happens to a frog's car when it breaks down?
[117:16.34]It gets towed away.
[117:18.56]What did the duck say when he brought lipstick?
[117:20.62]Put it on my bill.
[117:23.16]That one's too long.
[117:25.07]Is Google male or female?
[117:26.87]It's got to be female because it doesn't let you finish a sentence before making a suggestion.
[117:31.47]Clean jokes.
[117:35.11]These are long.
[117:36.09]These are too long.
[117:37.68]Hey, why was six afraid of seven?
[117:39.54]Because I'm not even going to fucking say it.
[117:41.42]I'm not going to say it because that's like the lamest joke.
[117:45.16]And this one, in fact, is so lame that it has 4,836 downvotes.
[117:52.03]Like, I mean, that's terrible.
[117:53.55]That's not good.
[117:55.11]A teacher asked her students to use the word beans in a sentence.
[117:58.55]My father grows beans, said one girl.
[118:01.09]My mother cooks beans, said a boy.
[118:02.69]A third student spoke up.
[118:04.97]We are all human beans.
[118:15.69]The beauty of the thriller.
[118:21.14]No, don't give me new shit.
[118:22.94]No, fuck.
[118:24.74]I don't want new items.
[118:26.25]I don't want new stuff.
[118:27.27]What's this stuff?
[118:31.27]I made that joke before.
[118:32.65]Feels great, man.
[118:48.02]Oh, here comes some shit.
[118:49.48]Nice.
[118:50.46]What is this?
[118:52.06]I don't think we've seen this one yet.
[118:53.14]It's like a weird auto shotty.
[118:59.24]Not really.
[118:59.64]This is actually kind of... I'm not displeased with this setup, actually.
[119:06.05]These guys have so much health, it's kind of stupid.
[119:26.65]That was Take Care of Those Guys in Two Shots really close.
[119:28.71]This actually, yeah, I like it.
[119:32.87]I'm going to have to give another joke, though.
[119:36.31]We're going to the second page, by the way, of LaughFactory.com.
[119:40.02]Clean jokes.
[119:44.48]Alright.
[119:46.18]In a Catholic school cafeteria, a nun places a note in front of a pile of apples.
[119:51.30]Only take one.
[119:52.60]God is watching.
[119:54.62]Further down the line, a pile of cookies is available.
[119:58.25]The little boy makes his own note.
[120:01.39]Take all you want.
[120:02.83]God is watching the apples.
[120:07.85]Got ya.
[120:10.19]Clever little kid.
[120:19.76]I'm doing clean jokes here, guys.
[120:24.06]AK-47.
[120:25.46]Which one of these guns, like, sucks?
[120:29.24]Grandpa's Blunderbuss is terrible.
[120:34.56]Here comes shit.
[120:36.86]Did I lose connection to chat again?
[120:40.60]Why are these all about God?
[120:41.72]I don't know.
[120:42.10]That's a good question.
[120:44.02]Watch your language.
[120:51.69]All the guns are bad.
[120:54.90]I like this one.
[120:55.54]Let's head out this way and go up.
[121:06.69]No.
[121:07.89]Over here.
[121:13.31]Hey, I was right.
[121:14.65]Beautiful.
[121:22.07]I swear to God, guys.
[121:24.53]If I get caution wet-floored, we're gonna have a huge problem.
[121:29.42]We're gonna have a big problem if I get caution fucking wet-floored.
[121:34.73]That is the bane of my... I can't play the game when I have caution wet-floored on.
[121:51.54]You're going to do it to me, aren't you?
[121:54.38]Tell better jokes.
[121:55.90]I'm not telling these jokes.
[121:57.14]I'm reading them from the laugh factory.
[122:11.33]Just go.
[122:11.61]I don't even care.
[122:21.76]Here we go.
[122:22.96]Yeah, this is like the laugh factory.
[122:24.82]You know, I don't think I've ever told you guys this, but instead of the John, I call my toilet the gym.
[122:38.36]That way it sounds better when I say I go to the gym first thing in the morning.
[122:51.58]Alright, what do you guys think would happen if I were to compile... Like... 20 of these.
[122:58.91]And I went to an actual link, went to an open mic night.
[123:01.77]And just, like, memorized them and said these.
[123:06.23]Would that be funny?
[123:07.25]If I did that?
[123:08.31]And filmed it?
[123:09.92]And tried to pass it off like this is my own, my jokes?
[123:20.16]That'd be so embarrassing.
[123:31.93]I should do it.
[123:37.41]Where's the one guy that's left?
[123:43.28]Live comedy stream.
[123:44.86]I'll have somebody just periscope it.
[123:51.94]Can't let any bugs get away.
[123:54.80]If one bug gets away, they'll still procreate in your walls and shit.
[123:58.68]That's what the Orcan man told me.
[124:04.09]I had a guy come over and did some... Gave me an estimate on my ant problem.
[124:09.26]And he came over and... Why does this sound like one of these jokes?
[124:14.75]This... That's the opening to one of these clean jokes.
[124:18.59]This is the... I swear this is not a clean joke.
[124:32.51]What are you buying?
[124:33.65]No wet floors.
[124:34.65]These guys do a million damage.
[124:38.61]I hate those things.
[124:49.07]I just want to use the shotgun.
[124:50.23]Can I only use this exclusively?
[124:51.81]Don't replace the shotgun.
[124:57.14]What is that?
[125:02.93]I've never seen that before.
[125:16.17]Damn.
[125:25.71]Cards?
[125:29.67]Are they homing cards?
[125:32.86]Let's find out.
[125:35.30]Kind of.
[125:36.52]These are good.
[125:37.18]Are these just better kunais?
[125:43.53]They're just homing kunais.
[125:45.37]They probably do less damage than the kunai, though.
[125:49.83]Alright, one more joke and then I'll be done.
[125:51.57]Remember, these are clean jokes.
[125:57.14]One kid says, Hey, I bet you're still a virgin.
[126:01.45]Then the other kid says, yeah, I was a virgin until last night.
[126:04.39]The other one says, as if.
[126:06.69]Yeah, just ask your sister.
[126:08.09]I don't have a sister.
[126:10.73]Well, you will in about nine months.
[126:14.23]I'm gonna vote a real clean joke.
[126:17.34]Laughfactory.com clean jokes.
[126:20.48]Okay.
[126:21.26]That's not a clean joke.
[126:23.98]It's a very, like, rude, dirty fucking joke.
[126:27.12]That's very clearly not a clean joke.
[126:35.90]I have to pee.
[126:37.34]Once I clean... Once I clean... No.
[126:39.10]Stop.
[126:39.52]When I clear this room, not when I clean this joke.
[126:42.20]Clear this room.
[126:43.86]When I clear this room, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[126:49.93]When I clean this joke, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[126:54.49]Holy shit.
[126:54.95]I need to go to bed.
[126:55.73]That's what I need to do.
[127:05.70]Alright.
[127:06.36]I'm gonna pee.
[127:07.84]I'm gonna be right back.
[127:10.58]BRB.
[127:14.69]BRB.
[127:17.39]This is it, though.
[127:18.35]Like, this is the boss.
[127:19.67]Right?
[127:21.21]It is.
[127:22.37]So, we'll see if I... Actually, no.
[127:23.67]I'll hold my pee.
[127:25.95]I'm gonna hold our pee.
[127:27.21]Because whatever happens here is gonna be the end of the stream.
[127:29.13]Let's hope I don't lose.
[127:41.60]Let's do it.
[127:44.82]We're going to go... Whatever.
[127:46.92]I kind of remember what happens here.
[127:52.17]This is the guy with the mirrors and he's going to dodge and shit.
[127:56.19]Is Kosh and Wet Floor going to be in the next Jerma Rumble?
[127:58.25]Well, thank you, Koshi.
[128:01.47]Probably not.
[128:02.13]Here we go.
[128:19.01]All my weapons suck, by the way.
[128:26.13]But if I'm patient, I should be able to beat him without much problem.
[128:30.89]I was just super impatient last time.
[128:46.16]Open up!
[128:48.20]Open up!
[128:51.02]Oh, that was dumb.
[128:55.63]Woof!
[129:00.77]The mic is picking up me peeing.
[129:03.31]I'm sure it is.
[129:04.05]Oh god, here comes the crazy mode.
[129:16.36]Chris, you're attacking the air.
[129:17.36]Thank you.
[129:22.72]Here comes the lasers, though.
[129:23.62]I gotta be careful.
[129:25.82]He puts them all over the place.
[129:27.08]I'm just gonna honestly just right-click and eat it.
[129:34.49]I had to do that.
[129:35.01]Like, I didn't know what the hell was going on.
[129:36.97]Yep.
[129:38.71]Okay, I'm good.
[129:42.33]Holy fuck.
[129:43.83]I wasn't expecting that.
[129:48.82]Come on!
[129:49.34]Am I not fast enough?
[129:53.99]What the hell is he doing now?
[129:55.05]Really?
[129:59.33]I'm gonna die.
[130:00.69]I'm dead.
[130:02.39]What the?
[130:02.85]This guy... This guy's... God damn it!
[130:07.36]Like... This guy fucking sucks.
[130:14.18]He's not even hard.
[130:15.64]That's just like... God damn it.
[130:19.04]Like... Oh my god.
[130:23.82]Literally, he just insta-put out laser beams everywhere, and I'm dead.
[130:32.90]I wasn't even impatient, either.
[130:34.30]He just was doing things that I just didn't fucking... wasn't ready for.
[130:37.26]And I'm, like, extra... Like, I should've beat him right there, too.
[130:48.28]That's, like, the fucking unfortunate thing.
[130:56.24]More clean jokes.
[130:58.54]I have to pee so bad.
[130:59.70]That was just a stupid mistake.
[131:01.77]Alright, rewind the clock like four hours and let me, like, pee.
[131:06.75]And I probably would've just beat him.
[131:08.13]Like, it's so easy.
[131:09.39]It's just... Stuff like that just irritates me and I can't... It's like the boss is... It's not even a boss.
[131:15.83]You just have to avoid the giant fucking room of nonsense.
[131:19.22]I hate that.
[131:19.80]Just let me fight a fucking boss.
[131:25.39]You get hit by the firewall like seven times.
[131:27.29]I know because like it turned into three and I never saw I didn't that didn't happen before.
[131:40.07]I've been holding my pee for four hours.
[131:41.73]No, I've just been just very overtired.
[131:44.51]I was up at like eight o'clock seven o'clock in the morning.
[131:53.20]Anyways, this is the last time you're going to see this game.
[131:57.52]So... Let's talk about that boss for a second.
[132:02.70]I was just getting so close.
[132:04.20]Honestly, I'm just blaming myself here.
[132:05.85]I was getting so close to him, just trying to kill him as fast as possible because I'm just fucking exhausted.
[132:11.99]This is the last time you're going to see this game.
[132:17.38]I would tell you that it is very, very good.
[132:19.46]I would say get it.
[132:21.82]It's absolutely incredible.
[132:24.38]Big fan.
[132:25.28]Except the second boss is fucking stupid.
[132:27.82]I mean, I'll just say it.
[132:28.66]That boss is dumb.
[132:30.71]It's not a hard boss.
[132:31.77]It's just fucking stupid.
[132:37.17]Make sure the capture card is fully plugged into the PCI slot.
[132:39.75]I have reseated it three times and I tried it in three separate slots.
[132:43.79]The card just sucks.
[132:51.53]First boss, whatever.
[132:52.31]You know, you live and die.
[132:53.94]Whatever.
[133:02.12]Boss doesn't suck.
[133:03.12]You suck.
[133:04.79]That boss is stupid.
[133:08.64]It's just a fucking guy that stands behind invincibility shields.
[133:13.12]You can only attack him like once every fucking like 20 seconds.
[133:17.22]And he shoots random shit across the whole room.
[133:20.12]It's a stupid fucking boss.
[133:22.88]It just is.
[133:28.27]You're stupid.
[133:35.43]That's good.
[133:43.24]I'm going to do it one more time.
[133:46.74]Because I'm going to pee and I'll be back.
[133:48.14]I'm going to do this one more time.
[133:54.12]I had invincibility shield too.
[133:55.48]Yeah, I don't get it.
[133:56.26]I don't get to do it.
[133:58.50]There's a difference between my invincibility shield and his invincibility shield.
[134:02.42]He has it up permanently and it gets taken down for five seconds.
[134:06.48]I have mine for five seconds and then I'm permanently able to be hurt.
[134:12.13]I'll be right back.
[134:15.41]Fuck this dumb shitty game.
[134:16.92]I'll be right back.
[136:16.50]Yeah, this is it.
[136:16.98]No matter what happens, this is it.
[136:22.82]This is it, no matter what.
[136:29.00]Get rid of this clean joke.
[136:30.04]So, like, if I wasn't doing the clean joke thing, maybe I would have been able to not have to pee.
[136:35.77]And, like, the piss would have been not super piss.
[136:39.43]I wouldn't have been, like, unbearable pee if I didn't stop to do a fucking clean joke every five seconds.
[136:57.96]Oh god fucking dammit.
[137:02.90]I have to like die now.
[137:03.88]I'm like, I'm so fucking overtired.
[137:06.25]This is so stupid.
[137:07.27]Just kill me.
[137:23.50]Last run, it's over.
[137:24.82]Okay, bye.
[137:26.71]Oh my fucking god.
[137:32.51]Please have thought.
[137:34.87]Fuck me.
[137:36.31]I don't even care.
[137:37.35]Let's go.
[137:39.85]Go, go, go, go, go.
[137:41.17]Whatever.
[137:42.13]We probably should have been using this guy anyways.
[137:43.67]Because he has the please don't die invincibility thing.
[137:46.09]And he's the only guy I have that's upgraded.
[137:47.51]So fuck it.
[137:48.01]Who cares.
[137:48.41]You know I'm going to get to the boss again.
[137:54.21]I'm going to lose at the boss again.
[137:55.33]I know it's going to happen, right?
[137:59.17]It don't even matter.
[138:00.39]Change the badge?
[138:04.53]No.
[138:05.97]It's staying on.
[138:10.05]We're fucking, like, winning this one.
[138:11.69]Like, already dead.
[138:30.20]Alright, give me some good ones.
[138:46.71]Well, we're good.
[138:47.35]We almost died completely.
[139:03.04]Let me make a spirit bomb.
[139:07.36]I really shouldn't have even done this.
[139:10.33]I should have just gone to bed when I had my opportunity to go to bed.
[139:13.23]But I'm dead.
[139:14.86]I'm going to guarantee die in this room.
[139:31.15]It's a fucking Christmas miracle that I'm still alive.
[139:44.91]Ah!
[139:46.77]Oh, well, thanks for the max health.
[139:52.73]I almost just jumped.
[139:53.38]How did I?
[139:54.12]That was definitely fate.
[139:56.66]It's definitely fate that I didn't die right there for some reason.
[139:59.34]I should have died like four times.
[140:14.10]No, just... I can't die.
[140:19.08]He would have killed me.
[140:29.33]It's only these guys.
[140:30.91]This room is so huge and it's only these staff guys.
[140:36.37]I'm not doing any damage either.
[140:38.57]Well, anyways, thanks everybody for watching.
[140:40.53]I really appreciate it.
[140:42.73]Go pick this game up if you want to spend the time and play it and get all these upgrades and have a lot of fun and I will gladly take that.
[140:55.88]May have just saved the run.
[140:57.04]Can't double jump with this guy!
[140:58.16]Can't double jump!
[141:30.60]Show's over.
[141:42.21]Oh my fucking god.
[141:46.97]Anyways... Thank you for watching.
[141:52.51]Thank you to the people that have given a lot of money.
[141:54.33]Like, for instance, like, CigaretteSpaghetti just gave 50 bucks.
[141:56.97]Can't double jump with this guy.
[141:59.09]No, you can't.
[141:59.63]I just, I forgot.
[142:00.69]And I tried, and I did.
[142:05.07]Thank you, Cigarette.
[142:05.91]That's 50 fucking bucks.
[142:08.15]To say that line.
[142:09.85]I appreciate it.
[142:11.61]RD Elite, thank you for the money.
[142:13.59]Here's a joke for you.
[142:14.37]What do you do, what do Jedi's use to read PDF files?
[142:18.60]Adobe One Kenobi.
[142:20.08]That's a good one.
[142:20.68]That's a good one.
[142:22.55]Scrumbledunkus again with 1500 bits.
[142:26.49]Dedicate a stream to me or something, I guess.
[142:28.45]Cheer, cheer, cheer.
[142:29.51]I'm done.
[142:30.03]Night all.
[142:31.19]Oh, this stream has been dedicated to Scrumbledunkus.
[142:35.97]Thank you, Scrumbledunkus.
[142:38.94]Get some rest.
[142:39.50]Drink water.
[142:40.40]Drink some water, Scramble.
[142:42.62]Make sure you drink at least like one ounce of water.
[142:45.08]No, way more than that.
[142:46.04]Like fucking 20 ounces or something.
[142:47.62]I don't know.
[142:48.14]I'm not a doctor.
[142:48.92]But just have some water and go to bed.
[142:52.76]The Gummy Monk thanks again for the five bucks.
[142:57.90]But anyways, guys, that is going to be it for Immortal Redneck.
[143:04.27]I wish I could have beaten the second pyramid.
[143:09.21]But my brain is a fucking mouse's brain.
[143:14.45]And I cannot handle when he instantly turns on the lasers.
[143:18.73]And fills the room with them.
[143:21.07]My brain is a fucking mice brain.
[143:23.52]And I couldn't do it.
[143:25.28]Maybe like off stream I could do that.
[143:26.96]And not have to be talking and making clean jokes like a fucking idiot.
[143:33.46]That's a lethal amount of water.
[143:34.64]20 ounces?
[143:35.36]That's not a lethal amount of water.
[143:36.76]What are you on about?
[143:40.54]But, if you're curious... If you're curious, I'm going to switch over for just a second.
[143:49.22]So there are three pyramids.
[143:53.38]We beat this one.
[143:54.14]We've gotten close to this one twice now.
[143:58.67]And when that one's done, this one opens up.
[144:01.33]I guess I'm going to assume that when you beat this one, this is probably the super ultra hard one.
[144:05.31]There's probably more.
[144:07.25]I don't know.
[144:07.87]I have no idea.
[144:09.27]I'm assuming there's one more thing after this, like the big super last boss.
[144:14.64]But there's a good amount of content here for $20.
[144:18.30]20 bucks.
[144:19.62]There's a lot to do.
[144:21.54]And it's very replayable.
[144:23.70]As you can see, I haven't even scratched the surface on upgrading my characters.
[144:28.94]So, I would highly recommend it.
[144:32.40]Just fuck that second boss.
[144:33.81]I'll say it again.
[144:36.15]You don't fuck it up.
[144:37.83]Don't care.
[144:38.45]Fuck that second boss.
[144:39.29]It is dumb.
[144:42.88]20 ounces is literally a bottle of soda.
[144:44.52]What the fuck are you people talking about?
[144:45.69]That's what I'm saying!
[144:46.45]20 ounces is like a bottle of water!
[144:49.13]Like 16 ounces?
[144:50.23]20 ounces?
[144:53.29]Anyways guys, uh... We will be back to normal.
[145:01.66]The second boss in the first pyramid is actually harder than any boss in the second pyramid.
[145:06.48]And we all have our- we all have our people we can't beat.
[145:11.42]Yeah, this is a complaint stream.
[145:12.46]Like, you saw the title.
[145:17.56]Anyways, good night, everybody.
[145:18.74]See you on Tuesday.
[145:19.58]We're gonna start Yakuza 0 on Tuesday, regardless.
[145:23.60]Because I'm just gonna get my old capture card and plug it in.
[145:27.17]So, hopefully it's fun.
[145:28.75]I've heard it's very, very funny.
[145:29.91]I've heard it's slow to start, though, so we might have a little slow start.
[145:33.73]We'll read some clean jokes as we go through Yakuza 0.
[145:39.50]Have a good night, guys.
[145:41.11]Take care.
[145:42.07]See you on Tuesday.
[145:42.99]Much love.
[145:45.29]Ta-ta for now.
