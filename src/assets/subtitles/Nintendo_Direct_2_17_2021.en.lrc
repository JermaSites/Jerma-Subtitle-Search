[00:46.94]You're five minutes late!
[00:49.94]No audio?
[00:50.40]Oh, there we go.

[00:58.64]I didn't even know there was a direct today.
[01:00.18]I had no idea.
[01:01.02]I don't even watch these.
[01:03.68]By repeating these cycles, you'll gradually unravel the mysteries hidden in the universe.
[01:10.43]Wait, did they spoil the game?
[01:11.53]I'm so disheveled right now.
[01:14.51]I haven't even brushed my teeth yet.
[01:19.10]I was getting out of the shower and somebody just goes, hey, dude, you're missing the direct.
[01:23.40]I was like, I don't... I don't care.
[01:29.94]But then I was like, I kind of do.
[01:32.58]I haven't even brushed my teeth yet.
[01:34.82]I got up like 10 minutes ago.

[02:16.76]Hold on a second.
[02:17.58]I wasn't ready for this.
[02:18.44]Why did I rush to turn the screen on and freak out for a direct?

[20:42.64]Trying to find a way to do it.
[20:45.14]I was going like this.
[20:46.60]I wasn't getting ready.
[20:52.36]I was getting ready to be like... There you go.
[20:54.04]This is your raid song.
[20:57.19]Welcome.
[20:57.97]Thanks for the raid.
[20:58.43]Thanks.
[20:58.57]Go follow Kid Pogo if you don't.
[20:59.69]What are you, out of your mind?
[21:10.97]Speaking of which, last week, we had the global launch for the Super Mario 3D World plus Bowser's Fury game.
[21:20.11]We hope you enjoy that Mario adventure as well.
[21:25.19]Next, we have another game to show you.
[21:27.39]Another one.
[21:30.11]What's this one?
[21:32.87]Zelda.
[21:33.69]The Legend of Zelda.
[21:35.77]Tipping the Scales.
[21:40.78]Legend of Zelda, the weight of time.
[21:49.10]What ideas will you expose?
[21:51.41]What was that?
[21:54.89]The latest in the HD 2D series.
[21:57.57]He leaves us no recourse.
[21:59.37]Zords!
[22:00.29]Never.
[22:01.45]Oh.
[22:02.01]Esfrost will answer for its crimes today.
[22:05.17]Are these the wages of loyalty?
[22:07.77]Raised Earth and burnt corpses.
[22:10.60]You and no other must decide how we proceed.
[22:14.24]I would love like a Christmas, like Santa RPG.
[22:16.40]It's like top down, like isometric Santa Claus.
[22:18.90]You like play as Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus.
[22:21.26]Like Rudolph cat.
[22:22.56]Frosty and shit.
[22:24.05]Where's that?
[22:24.49]Make that.
[22:25.09]Be cool.
[22:27.65]I promise to do all in my power to see us through this safely.
[22:31.15]Every last one of us.
[22:36.01]Triangle strategy?
[22:38.67]Far, far away lies the continent of Norzilia, comprised of three nations and limited deposits of salt and iron.
[22:47.48]The constant feuds among the nations over these precious resources eventually ignited into a great conflict.
[22:54.69]Known as the Salt Iron War.
[22:57.19]Though the hostilities ceased with an uneasy truce, decades later, the flames of war threatened to engulf the realm once again.
[23:04.09]Can I ask a question?
[23:05.26]What's with the burning embers that go across the screen on every trailer ever?
[23:08.78]It's always like the edges are burning and embers are floating across the screen in like half of every trailer I've ever watched.
[23:16.38]Pay attention, you'll see.
[23:24.76]In this new tactical RPG, battles take place on terrain with different elevations.
[23:30.15]A character's attack range is determined by their location and their equipped weapon.
[23:35.01]The range can be extended by attacking from higher ground with long-range weapons such as bows and arrows.
[23:42.24]Thus, your forces can use terrain and other elements to gain the upper hand.
[23:48.48]An enemy outflanked is susceptible not only to your initial attack, but also a powerful blow from the ally positioned behind the enemy.
[24:01.12]Charge into an enemy to see them flying into position for a follow-up attack.
[24:07.55]Link attacks together by first casting ice magic on the flames to create water terrain.
[24:14.55]Then, electrify the area with lightning magic.
[24:19.47]Pow-wop!
[24:21.29]I would have cared more if it was electrify the battlefield with pow-wop!
[24:26.63]Pow-wop!
[24:26.81]Oh, the scales come in?
[24:42.63]Utility, morality, liberty.
[24:46.39]Collectively, your decisions will establish your conviction, affecting how the story unfolds and who will join your cause.
[24:56.49]Once more, I would ask you plainly.
[24:59.40]Do we or don't we relinquish Prince Roland to Esdrost?
[25:03.58]Critical decisions that may determine the fates of nations are settled by vote on the scales of conviction.
[25:10.80]Use information you've gathered to sway allies toward your favored cause.
[25:15.79]It will be four of these over the course of the entire game.
[25:18.41]The story will significantly change based on how the votes are cast.
[25:22.17]So they refused to relinquish him to us.
[25:24.85]Lies!
[25:25.93]His hand was forced!
[25:27.75]As more and more critical decisions are made,
[25:30.51]Your journey may take you down paths divergent from those of other players.
[25:35.50]You will see what true might is.
[25:41.20]I'm sorry.
[25:46.28]Ever since Peter Molyneux told me that, like... If able to... Remember he talked about trees and shit?
[25:54.84]And how the world was gonna change?
[25:56.54]I don't trust anybody anymore.
[25:58.74]That tree that you plant there... Will turn... In a hundred years into an ice cream truck.
[26:05.45]I was like, holy shit, how the fuck is that gonna happen, Peter Molyneux?
[26:07.53]What are you talking about?
[26:08.29]That sounds insane.
[26:11.13]And that tree's roots will go into the ground and create ten cities of ants and mice.
[26:18.81]Like, okay, cool.
[26:20.61]And I think the biggest decision in that game is like, you have a dog.
[26:25.86]What kind of dog do you want?
[26:28.62]This is like two different, three different kinds.
[26:30.02]Oh shit, quiet.
[26:53.45]Star Wars Hunters is a competitive, free-to-play online game set between episodes 6 and 7.
[26:58.67]Clash in this third-person shooter coming to Nintendo Switch in 2021.
[27:01.80]He's just winding the toy up, ready to, like, pop up with pogs.
[27:05.88]I didn't get a chance.
[27:08.56]Do I look at you or the camera?
[27:10.36]Knockout City interviews, take one.
[27:13.19]We all play for different reasons.
[27:16.05]Corgan love battle.
[27:17.93]Corgan use many weapons.
[27:20.08]Triple-bladed war axe, spear of misery, Hades' soul-devouring crossbow.
[27:25.80]A princess is supposed to lead her people, not be stuck up in some tower waiting for a hero.
[27:31.11]In my line of work, bullets are constantly whizzing past you.
[27:34.19]Flaming longsword, blade of doom.
[27:37.05]Just once.
[27:38.11]Just once I'd like to catch one of the bullets.
[27:40.27]Are these all Fortnite skins?
[27:41.51]I don't know.
[27:41.88]The background's messing me up.
[27:43.02]With this crown, I'm going to lead my team to victory and kick some serious ass.
[27:49.84]Look, it's simple.
[27:51.00]Corgan want new weapon.
[27:52.56]In Knockout City, I'm like a Kung Fu master.
[27:55.32]I can catch bullets.
[27:58.23]Come get some.
[28:06.67]Is this dodgeball?
[28:09.75]Is this dodgeball?
[28:12.25]But no it's not.
[28:13.67]You can throw people.
[28:38.14]Why is this switch so small?
[28:42.53]Why are the switches so ti- Oh, no, no, no.
[28:46.99]They're controllers.
[28:48.97]I was like, why do they have tiny, like, iPhone switches?
[28:51.45]Because the other people had the switches in their hands looking down.
[28:55.68]We were not- There was no TV, we were told of.
[28:57.80]The big- The big orc guy had it in his hands looking down.
[29:02.44]But there was no television they're looking at.
[29:04.34]There's cameras.
[29:06.67]No, I'm telling you, like, two people had the thing looking down at it.
[29:12.64]The fight for survival starts now.
[29:15.98]Hang on tight, because you're all going to play a little game of fate for me.
[29:21.34]They're not real.

[30:10.88]The battle for survival begins in World's End Club.
[30:13.92]I feel like that'd be really hard to do that.
[30:15.10]Nintendo Switch, May 28th.

[30:24.98]Physical release?
[30:25.60]Hades, the critically acclaimed dungeon crawler and recipient of multiple Game of the Year awards, is getting a physical release on Nintendo Switch.

[35:35.66]Super Mario Galaxy 3.
[35:37.88]Next, please take a look at this.
[35:40.06]Super Mario Galaxy 3.
[35:40.83]Coming up.
[35:45.68]Hello there, I'm Eiji Aonuma, producer of The Legend of Zelda series.
[35:50.56]I'm sure a lot of you saw me and thought there might be news about the sequel to The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild game.
[35:56.45]Unfortunately, we don't have anything to share right now.
[35:59.75]We apologize.
[36:01.83]Development is proceeding smoothly and we should be able to bring you some new information this year.
[36:07.48]For now, we'll have to ask you to wait just a bit longer.
[36:11.39]And he goes, just kidding.
[36:12.61]Here's a trailer.
[36:13.03]While you're all waiting, however, this Legend of Zelda game will be coming to Nintendo Switch.
[36:17.46]What?
[36:18.02]Please take a look.
[36:29.38]The birds.
[36:30.38]The Legend of Zelda.
[36:32.74]He's a bird now.
[36:34.58]That'll be fun.
[36:37.00]I just said that would be funny.
[36:38.12]Like I'm laughing at the thing that... What?
[36:40.92]Like somebody else in the room said it.
[36:42.30]Alright, that'd be funny, Mike.
[36:44.00]I never played this one either.
[36:55.83]Okay, this is the one that I should have played.
[36:58.61]This looks like the one that I would have liked.
[37:01.43]Somebody said this is the worst one.
[37:05.98]This one sucks.
[37:07.71]Does it?
[37:08.77]This is the worst one.
[37:10.13]Really?
[37:12.01]What you've just seen is The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD.
[37:16.77]This game originally released in 2011 on the Wii console and now it's coming to Nintendo Switch.
[37:23.64]The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword featured a control scheme in which players would use the Wii Remote Plus controller as a sword and the Nunchuck controller as a shield.
[37:32.41]With the increased processing power of the Nintendo Switch system, the controls here are smoother and even more intuitive.
[37:39.45]And we've recreated the controls for the sword and the shield here by having the player hold two Joy-Con controllers.
[37:45.49]Oh, it's motion control.
[37:47.05]Okay, never mind.
[37:47.86]I hate it.
[37:50.02]Swing it to have Link swing his sword in the game.
[37:54.21]The Joy-Con controller in your left hand is the shield.
[37:57.01]By lifting the controller, you can raise the shield to block enemy attacks.
[38:01.07]You can perform other actions like using both controllers to wield a bow and arrow.
[38:06.49]These physical movements add a sense of urgency and tension to combat.
[38:11.55]But, we've also made it possible to play the game with button controls to ensure it can be played in handheld mode or on the Nintendo Switch Lite system.
[38:19.73]After mulling over how to assign different gameplay elements to different buttons, we decided to apply the sword motions to tilting the right control stick.
[38:27.89]Huh?
[38:30.69]But how do you-
[38:32.49]Tilt the stick down when you want to swing the sword downward.
[38:36.05]Oh shit.
[38:36.93]To swing to the right, to the left, or diagonally, just tilt the stick in the respective direction.
[38:44.92]This looks actually, that looks pretty good.
[38:48.04]Save, save, save.
[38:51.05]Specially designed Joy-Con controllers.
[38:54.02]The right Joy-Con controller is themed after the Master Sword, while the left features a Hylian Shield motif.
[38:59.82]I thought that you'd get a sword, too.
[39:01.94]I thought it was like, oh, by the way, you get the sword.
[39:11.11]We hope that people who played the original game on Wii and those playing it for the first time will enjoy discovering the origins of The Legend of Zelda.
[39:19.41]Joy-Con drift.
[39:21.00]Isn't that a problem?
[39:21.99]The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword HD launches July 16th.
[39:27.42]Following this Nintendo Direct, you'll be able to pre-order the game on Nintendo eShop, and the specially designed Joy-Con controllers will launch on the game's release date at your local retailers.
[39:37.03]Many of you may already know this, but The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword was the last original console game prior to The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild game, and it was still following the established conventions of The Legend of Zelda.
[39:47.79]However, it gave a glimpse into many features and innovations that would eventually be adopted in The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
[39:54.55]Using the sailcloth to descend in midair, a stamina gauge that depleted as you scaled walls-
[39:55.00]Oh, that looks fun.
[39:57.00]Would I like Breath of the Wild? Would Don't bullshit me here. Give me the real story.
[40:04.00]Would I really like this game? I don't play Legend of Zelda, I'm not a big fan of it.
[40:09.00]I respect it as a series, I think it's a great for everything.
[40:12.00]Without Legend of Zelda we would have nothing. We would have NOTHING.
[40:15.00]It is the Dungeons & Dragons of modern adventure games, I understand that.
[40:21.00]Would I like Breath of the Wild?
[40:26.93]Well, what did you think?
[40:29.01]The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword has been optimized for Nintendo Switch.
[40:29.66]Okay, maybe I'll try it.
[40:33.61]It includes intuitive motion controls and button controls by tilting the right control stick.
[40:38.38]How long do I cook bacon in an air fryer?
[40:40.26]The next game will be our last announcement for today.
[40:43.34]Please take a look at this.
[40:45.04]I don't know, but that was epic what you said.
[40:47.28]I don't know why.
[40:47.88]Something in that sentence.
[40:48.72]I don't know.
[40:53.21]Put bacon in an air fryer?
[40:54.43]Cook it in the fucking pan or the oven?
[40:57.63]Be careful.
[40:58.09]Is this?
[41:04.71]Oh shit.
[41:12.31]Is this Splatoon 3 or is this like Splatoon RPG game?
[41:16.25]Fallout Splatoon.
[41:32.29]Here it comes.
[41:39.22]What the hell is this?
[42:01.65]Platoon Rust.
[42:35.97]What the hell is this game?
[42:36.81]It's going to be skateboard.
[42:46.28]Skateboard.
[42:46.77]Splatoon 3.
[42:49.33]Oh, I didn't.
[42:50.11]It's Splatoon 3.
[42:50.63]Oh.
[43:08.00]Where are we dropping?
[43:24.44]Come on.
[43:25.14]Give me that one.
[43:26.90]Of course you're going to drop right there.
[43:29.12]It's two teams on either side.
[43:30.62]Come on.
[43:31.66]That's the comedy.
[43:32.46]That's the humor in that one I just said.
[43:36.28]What the fuck?
[43:38.72]2022.
[43:38.76]Hold on, hold on.
[43:49.22]What you've just seen is the latest installment in the Splatoon series, Splatoon 3.
[43:55.15]This game is scheduled to launch in 2022, so it'll be a while.
[43:59.97]We hope you'll stay tuned for more information at a later time.
[44:05.91]I didn't really play it.
[44:06.95]That's not.
[44:07.19]No, it's not.
[44:07.45]It's not over.
[44:07.97]It's over.
[44:39.06]Okay.
[44:44.24]Well, that was the Nintendo Direct.
[44:47.54]So, let me give you my thoughts.
[44:49.58]What do we see?
[44:52.95]What do we see?
[44:55.13]We saw Super Mario Animal Crossing skins.
[45:00.71]Kind of cool.
[45:02.27]We saw... What's wrong?
[45:04.65]What do you got?
[45:06.77]It's my 5 o'clock shadow.
[45:08.33]That's a 5 o'clock shadow.
[45:09.73]Are you talking about up here?
[45:10.65]Okay.
[45:10.99]Well, ban that person for three days.
[45:15.10]It's like a beard.
[45:19.16]You missed Team Fortress 3.
[45:20.02]What did we saw?
[45:26.71]We saw... Why did I even turn the stream on for this?
[45:32.24]One person told me to turn this on.
[45:34.16]Somebody was like, dude, you're missing the direct.
[45:35.92]Get the fucking Nintendo Direct.
[45:37.52]And I'm like, fuck, I got to get on there.
[45:41.48]Why did I even stream that?
[45:43.50]I mean, there was a couple of cool things.
[45:50.49]What did I see?
[45:51.33]Oh, Travis Touchdown.
[45:53.13]No More Heroes 3.
[45:55.31]Looked like it was going to be fun.
[45:57.29]We got a release date too.
[45:58.43]August.
[45:59.39]Kind of far away.
[46:01.56]Mario Golf, that's right.
[46:02.50]Mario Golf, that's a PogChamp moment.
[46:05.36]What else was there?
[46:05.88]Ninja Gaiden.
[46:13.20]Alright, yeah.
[46:13.78]No, that's true.
[46:16.89]I mean, I could've... I could've rolled over in bed and, like, opened Twitter and seen, like, the first somebody going, hey, there's a new Mario Golf.
[46:27.23]That's so cool.
[46:28.51]And I would just be like...
[46:31.33]Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[46:33.30]I'll just go back to bed.
[46:38.14]That's like a rollover.
[46:39.32]That's a good surprise on Twitter this morning.
[46:42.60]Alright.
[46:43.60]I'm going back to bed.
[46:46.76]One voice Andy.
[46:47.46]What do you mean one voice Andy?
[46:48.28]What are you talking about?
[46:49.22]What are you talking about?
[46:49.90]This is me.
[46:50.33]What do you mean one voice Andy?
[46:51.95]One voice Andy.
[46:52.63]You made that up.
[46:53.37]You have to lie.
[46:53.87]Alright.
[46:54.09]Well, now we're going to play a game.
[46:59.00]I'm going to get off the camera here because why would I need to be on camera anymore?
[47:02.32]We're going to play... What the heck are we doing?
[47:08.18]Slime Rancher, that's right.
[47:09.10]I'm going to play Slime Rancher.
[47:14.27]I'm looking forward to it.
[47:16.97]Let me get... Just let me get BRB for one second.
[47:18.55]I'm going to brush my teeth.
[47:23.58]Get back on camera.
[47:24.32]Hold on.
[47:24.59]I need to like change the switch stuff.
[47:26.95]I'll be right back.
[47:27.45]Just watch.
[47:27.78]Look at some art for a second.
[47:28.50]I'll be right back.
