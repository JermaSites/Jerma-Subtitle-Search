[00:01.06]my headphones the the headset that I bought was great but it it was too muffling and now I can hear a lot more it's really good so dude bows used to make these headphones they were perfect they were little gel inserts they were the greatest thing of all time ever you ever try iems um during like a show you're the one like the the molded ones to your ear
[00:30.90]No, just a normal IEM.
[00:34.68]Oh, maybe not.
[00:35.42]I don't think it's going to be molded.
[00:39.79]I'm just weird.
[00:40.31]I use those sometimes.
[00:43.33]They look good.
[00:45.63]Alright, I'm going to go live.
[00:48.06]I'll be with you guys shortly.
[00:50.38]I'm going to ask my chat if we need to finish the tutorial.

[02:09.68]You're going professional streamer?
[02:12.50]Is it a blue snow... Yeah, guys, I got a blue snowball.

[03:33.21]oh yeah you're the you're the glue it was really bad I'll tell you the pilot can scan yeah I took a few notes some of those interactions could have been a little smoother I think make your way to the bridge is that today are we doing that today no it'll be uh an email okay okay send me an email
[04:03.15]alright so this game is it seems kind of fun we we're gonna fly around and we are we like pirates what are we it seems kind of like uh see if thieves kind of beat we're all on the boat together
[04:20.40]Vinny told me he's an expert, but I think he lied.
[04:22.88]I'm doing the tutorial, and I don't understand anything, by the way.
[04:25.56]Neither do I. I really don't either.
[04:26.93]I don't understand anything.
[04:28.31]Okay, Pug, were you doing the same thing that I was just doing?
[04:32.30]It was reading me.
[04:34.18]It was speaking a completely different language.
[04:36.14]It may as well not have been English.
[04:37.43]This one goes out to the boys back home, you know what I'm saying?
[04:42.40]I could turn on the power for a while.
[04:47.83]Yeah, I had a little bit of trouble.
[04:49.10]Alright, now I got to fly to the nav buoy?
[04:54.81]I heard it.
[04:55.17]It was too soon for the boys.
[04:58.41]Back home.
[04:59.55]Star, how do you... Star, how do I power it?
[05:04.26]How do you power it?
[05:06.79]There's like an icon for every objective that tells you exactly where to go and exactly what to do.
[05:12.47]I did it, but I'm prepared scan the signature.
[05:15.78]I'm kind of a fucking nerd.
[05:18.28]I did the homework.
[05:20.96]Oh, I think ads are everyone.
[05:22.01]Oops.
[05:22.65]Oh shit.
[05:23.09]Here they come.
[05:26.35]Ruster boost, toggle view cruise mode.
[05:33.22]Dude, did my keyboard lose connection?
[05:37.05]It did.
[05:44.55]You have a wireless keyboard?
[05:46.75]Hold on.
[05:46.93]I have to like unplug my keyboard.
[05:50.48]Wait, you have a wireless keyboard?
[05:51.84]No, I got a wired one.
[05:53.86]Hey, Jerem, I'm sorry.
[05:54.51]I think we had less trouble when you weren't here.
[05:57.75]We didn't even, we didn't even start.
[06:06.48]Arc Raider's good?
[06:07.12]What?
[06:09.53]What about Arc Raiders?
[06:10.84]it good I got the a key for beta or I think I think you like it it's interesting why do I have to unplug my keyboard to play this game wow plug in your uh plug in your Game Boy alright it works now alright I gotta uh fly oh there we go I can I can press the button now
[06:48.34]Oh, we're going.
[07:01.08]Can you crash this shit?
[07:05.40]Can you crash?
[07:08.26]I mean, we're just going to crash, right?
[07:12.85]We're going to find you like a... Yo.
[07:16.58]Like a water boy role.
[07:21.87]I mean, the game's cool.
[07:22.79]This is really cool.
[07:28.54]Just give me the machine gun and I'll be good.
[07:31.44]Do we shoot things?
[07:35.12]Uh, the ship gets cannons.
[07:36.76]Did you not get to that part in the tutorial?
[07:39.25]I just crafted one right now.
[07:40.63]Oh shit, how do you slow down?
[07:50.03]I can try hosting a game and skipping the tutorial if you guys can join.
[07:59.21]Okay.
[08:00.17]I'm going to join in too.
[08:03.54]I mean, I did it.
[08:09.43]What'd you do, Jerm?
[08:12.87]I'm shooting the mines.
[08:15.43]That's cool.
[08:18.69]You're almost done.
[08:19.39]There's like one thing after that.
[08:21.47]Okay, here we go.
[08:24.48]I think I could probably make one too, considering I had to have done the tutorial five months ago, right?
[08:35.68]I guess.
[08:41.42]New game mode.
[08:45.27]this is why we need four or five people to play this so then you guys just get the jump charges and I press the button and then somebody shoots me is there any math in this game this is like a math game
[09:09.06]It's not really, from what I remember, it's not a math game, but it's kind of like Star Trek FTL.
[09:13.92]It's like, you're cooperating.
[09:17.53]You're not really doing math, no.
[09:20.41]And my chat's like, is this another Lethal Company?
[09:22.77]Like, it's not.
[09:25.22]Can one of us just walk around town and pick up trash?
[09:30.78]Why would you want to do that?
[09:34.09]I don't know, it's kind of straightforward.
[09:37.09]Easy.
[09:37.73]Easy task.
[09:42.44]Alright, I'm going to invite you guys.
[09:46.42]It's fun, though.
[09:47.00]I do remember enjoying it at the very least, even if I don't remember the... Why?
[09:51.77]I don't remember why, but I did.
[09:54.13]Right, right.
[09:54.55]It was one of those.
[09:55.23]Exactly that.
[09:56.03]Yeah.
[09:57.74]Have you ever played FTL?
[09:59.14]Huh?
[10:03.16]Have you ever played FTL?
[10:05.23]Yeah.
[10:06.91]I think you'll enjoy this.
[10:10.38]I missed out on the fbl my brain's too small for ftl we're safely inside the void there's like four rooms it doesn't matter set the jump destination to the exit sector actually my brain is perfectly large for ftl the issue that I have with it is I don't know I just couldn't do it it's fair it's large and smooth a little smooth how you been by the way Jerm
[10:40.81]I've been good, I've been good.
[10:43.03]Good, man.
[10:46.71]Wow.
[10:47.88]That's good.
[10:48.86]You're already picking favorites this early into the stream?
[10:51.38]Just wanted to, because, you know, me, you, and Poke, we hung out a little bit a couple weeks ago.
[10:57.28]We were playing that game, Hammerwatch.
[11:01.27]It was a mess.
[11:03.09]I enjoyed it.
[11:05.85]Yeah, glad I missed out on that one.
[11:10.36]Jerm, I don't know what your name is on Steam.
[11:14.56]I don't know how to get you in here.
[11:18.35]Frogman?
[11:19.07]Yeah, Stuart told me Vinny wanted to play again.
[11:20.61]I'm like, wait, really?
[11:22.45]I do, I do.
[11:23.19]I just haven't had the time.
[11:25.06]I was like, what?
[11:29.66]Then I said, Jerm, are you the fourth wheel?
[11:32.38]I am the wheel, okay?
[11:35.05]Well, you know what?
[11:35.69]Cars need four wheels.
[11:38.27]Oh, there is a new long drive game, by the way.
[11:41.07]Apparently, it's not bad.
[11:43.39]He's already thrown in hints.
[11:44.89]Got to play in the future.
[11:46.58]We still got to do Warcraft at some point, too.
[11:49.54]Warcraft.
[11:50.30]That's right.
[11:50.94]Warcraft custom games.

[13:45.08]Uh, I'll be scavenger.
[13:47.32]That's kind of like the trash one.
[13:48.40]Your refresh rate is low.
[13:55.99]Oh, shit.
[13:59.06]There's a lot of screen tearing happening.
[14:00.70]It's fine.
[14:01.22]I'm not worried about it.
[14:01.86]Alright.

[14:24.23]You sound good.
[14:29.14]Alright, I'm going to be scavenger.
[14:33.04]unless you guys want me to like be the captain and pilot the ship I said I wanted to be captain and no one responded you know you should be the captain for sure I'm yeah I feel like you'd be a good captain Ster wow guys sorry I'll be Vinny do you want to be captain no because I'll take back everything I don't remember I don't captain I don't even remember how I played like what how to play the game so you're good Ster you can be as a captain I'm totally open to mutiny
[15:01.80]it's one of my defining traits I selected that gene where I'm just like emotionally okay with it is that we we press the button and you eject out and into the freezer I you guys could all put me in there sure I don't want to be an engineer you should be gonna for sure yeah dude that sounds good the scavenger honestly sounds like the hardest one I'll do scavenger I'm excited I'm excited to do that I guess I'll be engineer
[15:32.38]When you're carrying a power cell, the charge level recharges.
[15:36.20]Oh, great.
[15:38.44]Wow, that's... Wow, how exciting.
[15:42.87]You mean when I carry a power charge, I can power charge something?
[15:46.12]Oh, wow, I'm so excited.
[15:52.91]I guess I'm the engineer.
[15:58.31]We've got a couple different ships we could be.
[16:03.09]Dude, you look so cool!
[16:04.19]How do you- where'd you get all this?
[16:06.75]I just played two hours.
[16:08.79]Is this what you get in two hours?
[16:11.04]Yeah.
[16:11.42]What do you get in ten?
[16:12.16]Oh my god.
[16:13.48]Oh wait, who's this guy?
[16:14.42]Oh, I thought that was one of us.
[16:15.52]Yeah, me too.
[16:16.87]I thought it was the same thing.
[16:18.67]Jesus.
[16:23.97]Well, he's over here acting like he fucking belongs.
[16:26.70]Get out of here.
[16:28.08]Let's do the, um... He's got comic book armor.
[16:35.94]I don't know if I want to do the big ship.
[16:40.09]Yeah, can we get the smallest little dinghy?
[16:42.69]Let's get a little one, yeah.
[16:44.71]Let's start, yeah, let's start little, and then we can, when we learn how to play more, we can go up.
[16:57.01]Homunculus.
[16:59.41]The galaxy map?
[17:03.57]Yeah, we could do that.
[17:05.61]gameplay challenge centers on power management you know what basic loadout fuck it we don't know how to play this so basic rookie Vinny told me in like dms that he had 20 hours in this Ster you know that's not true he told me in dms that he had two I think what he may have just did a typo and added the zero for yours but didn't uh know that he made the mistake
[17:31.73]maybe that's what I think happened I just like lying I like lying to Ster I like being toxic in Ster's dms yep we're gonna have an argument about this later yeah please just not in front of my friends I'll just be honest with you guys I have no idea what is going on
[17:53.01]I'll make sure we got this.
[17:56.33]You and I are in the same boat.
[17:57.86]I'm on the exact wavelength.
[17:59.90]I feel like I'm going to ruin this.
[18:01.58]I'm so worried.
[18:02.44]Me too.
[18:02.80]No, no, no.
[18:05.06]There is no ruining.
[18:05.96]I did.
[18:07.14]It was that bad.
[18:08.71]We're kind of just talking.
[18:10.25]You picked the boat, right?
[18:12.81]I think so.
[18:13.69]Are we going?
[18:14.17]Do we have to go on individual ships?
[18:17.63]No, we go into the one.
[18:18.59]We're all on the same ship.
[18:20.94]It's like that show Star Trek.
[18:26.22]Alright, we're strapping in.
[18:27.58]Okay.
[18:29.79]Like we're all away from each other.
[18:31.41]Ster trick.
[18:32.33]This is where the emperor shows up when he starts talking to us, right?
[18:36.47]Which emperor?
[18:38.46]The emperor?
[18:39.50]He pops up in the 3D thing and he's just trying to sell you something.
[18:43.20]No.
[18:44.46]That emperor or are you talking about like a Warhammer emperor?
[18:48.79]That.
[18:50.25]Yeah, that.
[18:51.09]Yeah, that one.
[18:52.83]That guy.
[18:53.44]Alright, alright.
[18:55.55]My guy said no, but your guy said yes.
[18:57.87]So I think we're talking about different emperors.
[19:02.12]How do you get on the ground?
[19:05.23]Oh, so you guys are swimming.
[19:07.21]We gotta activate gravity.
[19:09.11]Yeah, if you jump, you get a little stuck.
[19:13.66]You need to crouch to go down or fly into a stairs.
[19:21.09]Vinny, if you do it, we're never gonna learn.
[19:24.15]Hey, I'm the engineer.
[19:25.17]Let me do it.
[19:26.36]Well, now you can jump and we won't float around.
[19:29.32]Oh, who did that?
[19:31.58]Ship has lost power.
[19:33.36]Okay, sorry.
[19:34.17]I just heard glass break.
[19:41.81]Oh, something need charging?
[19:43.20]Oh, don't worry.
[19:43.88]I'll hold it.
[19:44.96]We got to charge the void drive.
[19:47.86]You just did this in the tutorial, right?
[19:50.16]I got it.
[19:50.60]I got it.
[19:53.30]Okay, so yeah, we're gonna each have a station, right?
[19:57.72]Charged.
[19:58.08]Alright, you doing the calibration?
[20:00.77]To speed it up?
[20:01.69]Calibrating?
[20:02.25]Calibrate it.
[20:04.73]Have you messed- okay.
[20:06.31]It's very hard.
[20:08.96]See, my stream can't tell that it's just like four different directions you had to press.
[20:12.36]Get out of here.
[20:12.84]Wait, I'm not supposed to be in here?
[20:14.02]Breathing down my fucking neck while I'm at work.
[20:15.72]Get out of here.
[20:18.55]Well, I am the captain.
[20:20.89]It's kind of my business.
[20:21.93]It's my ship.
[20:23.25]Like I'm trying to leave.
[20:26.61]Prepare the ship's void drive.
[20:30.02]What do we do to prepare?
[20:32.28]Jerma's doing it.
[20:33.90]Jerma's handling it.
[20:34.96]Poke, what was your role?
[20:36.22]What do you want to do?
[20:37.92]Activated.
[20:38.50]Are you void locking?
[20:40.64]What?
[20:41.29]Close it.
[20:44.27]I didn't know it was like that.
[20:46.37]It's prepared.
[20:46.99]We're good.
[20:47.37]What happened, buddy?
[20:48.05]That's how you go to space and die.
[20:50.27]We actually go out there?
[20:53.07]Did you do the tutorial?
[20:54.41]Yeah, I got to the part where I fabricated a turret.
[21:01.04]Okay, you didn't go out here.
[21:03.47]If you go in there, you need to depressurize it and then open the outdoor.
[21:10.54]And if you don't have oxygen, you die.
[21:12.44]Don't liquefy me.
[21:13.96]And if you don't...
[21:16.07]Undo the pressure.
[21:18.09]So I can do it right now.
[21:18.67]I can depressurize him.
[21:19.54]Don't look for me, please.
[21:22.04]Okay, it's a whole thing.
[21:23.44]So I'll find something for you to do.
[21:26.05]Poke.
[21:26.79]Vinny, get out of my seat.
[21:28.65]How do you know this stuff, sir?
[21:29.95]Have you had a ship before?
[21:31.26]This is my third ship.
[21:33.60]I've crashed two.
[21:34.76]Can I steer it?
[21:35.77]Wait, I can steer it?
[21:39.56]Um, hold on to yourselves.
[21:40.98]I died.
[21:41.62]I forgot about that.
[21:42.48]I just died.
[21:43.50]I just remembered that that happens too.
[21:48.93]How did you die?
[21:50.11]Yeah, that's bad.
[21:50.85]We don't want to be dead this early.
[21:53.35]When you initiate the void travel, it shoots us all backwards into walls.
[21:57.56]That's right.
[21:57.96]We need to strap in.
[21:59.04]I forgot about that.
[22:01.32]Yeah, your captain would have reminded you if he was allowed to sit in the captain's seat.
[22:04.78]I'm glad I was sitting in the chair.
[22:07.53]Wait, Jerma, you didn't die.
[22:09.58]no you you know he was the pilot he was in the seat I didn't press the jump button I didn't press the jump button I was just sitting in the seat I I saw you do it I didn't press the jump button I did not you pulled the void lever no I didn't I just sat in the chair yeah I don't know how that happened
[22:27.37]Maybe the game was just sick of us.
[22:29.39]I pulled the lever and then Jerma sat in the chair.
[22:32.25]Oh, okay.
[22:32.89]Okay.
[22:33.31]Okay.
[22:33.58]So you're all sus.
[22:35.94]Meeting.
[22:36.50]Meeting.
[22:37.04]Would it ever really look like this or just like the ideas from the movies?
[22:41.65]Like a tube.
[22:43.05]That's true.
[22:43.75]Well, I'll let you know when we do light speed travel, folk.
[22:48.28]Boy jump destination.
[22:50.06]Locked.
[22:50.97]Okay, we got a destination.
[22:52.58]We're gonna go to an easy mission.
[22:54.06]Everybody get in your chairs, I think.
[22:55.64]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[22:57.96]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[22:59.43]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:01.31]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:05.11]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:09.64]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:10.26]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:10.88]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:11.50]Oh, no, no, we should be good.

[23:15.33]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:15.97]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:16.75]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:17.63]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:19.19]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:19.83]Oh, no, no, we should be good.
[23:20.54]Oh
[23:20.86]Clean up the blood too.
[23:22.80]To weaken the hollow, destroy every void conduit present in this sector.
[23:29.29]The hollow will react aggressively to the destruction of any conduit.
[23:33.00]Once we begin, we must move swiftly since they'll keep sending reinforcements to protect the remainders.
[23:38.15]Okay, we need guns, right?
[23:39.81]Yeah, we need guns.
[23:41.15]We already have guns to sit in?
[23:43.27]We have one gun.
[23:44.90]We have left side guns.
[23:47.80]I feel like I want to touch this one.
[23:49.88]a gunner it looks like a missile um we have we have guns but we have batteries to do more guns yeah we go to the recycling center thing what does this mean does it need a battery if it's low oh it's not powered Vinny yo right here you see this the the voltage on this thingy what does that mean it needs better it means um that means now it's powered
[24:20.61]oh don't waste too much ammo but yeah yeah you're good now um so you got to press the thing you got to put a battery in there and then press it so it's on battery right here yeah oh is this the power cell this one's on too alright this is on circuit breakers under strain what circuit breakers at capacity turn it off turn it off turn it off turn it off system now running within power network tolerance anything I didn't do you guys flipping every switch I'm just trying some stuff out yeah
[24:49.87]Okay.
[24:51.00]What's this?
[24:52.30]Can I hit our own ship?
[24:54.50]Yes.
[24:55.20]There is friendly fire.
[24:57.81]Oh, man.
[25:00.09]I don't remember so much.
[25:01.49]I'm going to fly towards the enemy and we're going to trial by fire this.
[25:06.18]All these valves are all breathing out at me.
[25:09.90]I'm fixing it.
[25:12.25]Can the engineer charge the thruster boosts?
[25:16.27]How do I do that?
[25:19.46]Come on, man.
[25:20.52]This thing right here?
[25:21.90]Come on, dude.
[25:23.44]This is the void charge drive charge?
[25:29.55]Recharging right now.
[25:30.17]We didn't have life support on.
[25:31.42]What the hell happened?
[25:37.52]Alright, this thing is charging up.
[25:38.59]30%.
[25:39.17]There's a lot of drones coming.
[25:41.93]There's drones?
[25:43.09]Poke, you got this?
[25:44.60]I'm on the left side.
[25:46.04]You got it?
[25:46.64]Okay.
[25:52.48]Alright, Vinny, you got this one?
[25:54.66]I'm not really sure.
[25:55.64]I don't know what I see right now.
[26:00.65]Oh, it's loaded, Vinny.
[26:01.43]I'm flying us around.
[26:03.08]So Jerm, when there's an enemy, maybe you just shoot them.
[26:08.48]I don't know.
[26:08.88]I don't remember.
[26:11.51]Well, like, who's going to do the communications first to see if they're worth shooting?
[26:19.41]I think we see a sniper now, right?
[26:21.78]What is that?
[26:22.86]Yeah, what is that?
[26:23.42]That needs to die.
[26:25.54]I shoot it right now?
[26:26.46]Yeah, shoot that thing.
[26:29.99]Nice.
[26:30.35]Nice hit.
[26:31.01]Hit.
[26:31.29]Hit.

[26:39.16]The heat?
[26:41.00]Seems like you're doing okay.
[26:43.44]This thing's flying at us.
[26:46.95]um there's a lot of things coming around this asteroid at us got it okay dead there's a lot of fighters okay oh this thing's sparking in here got it fix it fix it wait another big one I'm promoting poke to captain

[27:22.48]Look at these fractures.
[27:23.12]My family would be so proud of me.
[27:25.52]Sir, power is routed and available to use.
[27:32.68]Captain, I don't understand what it means to be human.
[27:35.76]Do you care to explain?
[27:38.20]What is laughter?
[27:40.05]What is love?
[27:41.45]Baby, don't hurt me.
[27:43.15]Oh, there's an animus crate.
[27:44.47]Kinetic point defense.
[27:45.71]Mark one.
[27:47.35]do you need to get out and go get it it's we're a little too far from it um but Ster if you could get us up there I could grab it so okay well there's a lot of fighters still shooting at us don't we have another gun uh yeah I was in there I'm gonna help behind the rock got it okay well we're right next to that uh animus crate
[28:16.39]Are we?
[28:17.47]We are, but there's a bunch of fighters on us.
[28:21.20]So we have a vacuum that could suck in product.
[28:25.04]The crate.
[28:27.28]Called my mouth.
[28:29.98]I wasn't going there.
[28:33.45]Whose turn is that?
[28:34.49]I just hit that motherfucker with a missile.
[28:36.79]We have two turrets.
[28:38.35]Yours sounds like a cool song.
[28:41.01]Like a club.
[28:41.47]Oh, yeah.
[28:44.46]The club next door.
[28:45.50]circuit breakers good we need to do I need to reset these I think everything's good in terms of power so far at least signature detected anybody anything you might need a towel loaded slightly I think we have seven I'm sorry I was on the options one of the ships circuit breakers okay right clear I like shooting them um so so Ster
[29:11.67]Miner, nano, we got alloy clusters out here.
[29:15.50]If you face the right side of the ship to the, um, that thing, I could, I could engage the suck.
[29:23.16]Okay, suck me off.
[29:24.67]I'm turning you.
[29:26.19]You can't, you just, you can't just say that, buddy.
[29:29.76]Okay, you need to get a little bit of romance first.
[29:33.09]What's going on?
[29:34.15]What's happening?
[29:34.69]No, no, no.
[29:35.19]There's a threat coming out.
[29:36.69]Guys, the minor power cell needs to be charged from the gunner.
[29:39.66]I got something.
[29:40.28]Alright, I'm going to turn this off.
[29:41.52]Guys, there's a summoner.
[29:42.98]There's a summoner.
[29:43.71]There's a wizard out here.
[29:45.19]They can call reinforcements.
[29:46.91]Power it.
[29:47.75]Do I shoot him?
[29:49.51]Yeah.
[29:50.18]Fuck, reinforcements are inbound.
[29:51.80]I don't know what I'm doing.
[29:53.18]I don't know what I'm doing.
[29:53.90]I lied on my resume.
[29:55.34]I lied on my resume.
[29:56.18]I'm not supposed to be in here.
[29:57.22]Why would you?
[29:59.15]It's down.
[29:59.63]It's down.

[30:07.44]Coming.
[30:08.78]Oh, is that right there?
[30:09.58]The nano alloy cluster?
[30:12.98]Sorry, I'm turning us to these fighters.
[30:15.88]not gonna lie I'm just pressing every button that's available that's good that's good and that's what we need from you we got a we got a ton I don't know if I'm being helpful or not I'm doing alright I think wait fabricator
[30:44.30]What?
[30:48.81]Circuit breaker failed.
[30:49.79]Oh, yeah.
[30:50.57]Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[31:11.63]Diet Coke.
[31:13.14]Make it less fizzy.
[31:15.40]Okay.
[31:15.80]I'll do my best.
[31:17.24]What I'll do is I'll put the whole thing in my mouth, swish it around, and then spit it back out.
[31:21.01]Just suck the air out.
[31:22.07]Yeah.
[31:26.22]Do you guys know flight attendants hate Diet Coke because it's the most sparkly one and it takes forever to unfizz?
[31:33.39]We got more...
[31:36.61]I feel like there's so many for a level one.
[31:39.92]Can we get a right side suck coming up?
[31:41.60]Right side suck?
[31:42.60]Can someone suck this?
[31:43.69]Right side suck?
[31:44.51]Yes.
[31:45.41]Jerm, you want to do that?
[31:47.83]Right now.
[31:48.15]We need to suck right now or we're getting shot.
[31:50.44]We're getting hurt.
[31:51.12]We're getting hurt.
[31:53.51]Hold on.
[31:53.75]I got your diet coke here.
[31:56.76]So now, Jerm, these items here, we grab them.
[32:01.13]Let me show you.
[32:02.73]Does anybody else think that the whole starboard is all made up just to make people sound smart and that it's totally unnecessary?
[32:08.62]There's no situation where you need to say that?
[32:11.56]What's a starboard?
[32:13.25]That's a storage.
[32:15.45]Okay.
[32:16.17]Got it.
[32:17.79]Yeah.
[32:19.33]So that's what we do with all the random stuff there.
[32:23.46]What do we need?
[32:24.22]We got...
[32:27.93]what if you're at the back of the shit you still have a left and a right halo launcher you guys are killing them we're doing just fine you never charged my thruster boosters you piece of shit hold on I got it we got an arc shield coming up on our right I need a sucker how do I oh wait almost recycled the battery that's bad right
[32:55.28]I don't know I need a sucker we might need those batteries I think yeah sarcophagus oh this is nice how does this charge the battery charge this is just oh by itself okay yeah you stick it in there and a little charge on its own this is cool alright hold on we're gonna get one more suck going in a sec
[33:20.02]never mind threat detected I don't want to be out there I changed my mind okay the suck is coming I'm just the executioner I just flipped the switch and just fry everybody like what is there what else can I do here you can shoot there's another cannon you need can we make an upgraded cannon for me or no yeah yes we can do that I just hit us oh crap you can hit us oh yeah you can yeah
[33:47.78]Sorry.
[33:48.44]Sorry, I'm turning us.
[33:49.62]I was focused on the suck.
[33:52.91]There's an alpha there.
[33:54.49]Oh, that guy calls reinforcements to our left.
[33:56.51]The circle, the spinny, the spinner, spinner.
[33:59.67]Got him.
[34:05.50]Shit.
[34:05.90]Alright, I'm turning us to the fighters.
[34:07.12]Kinetic point defense mark one is coming in right now.
[34:10.75]I don't... You good on power?
[34:14.19]Yep.
[34:16.69]I need more power.
[34:18.17]We've got nine of six, so we're overloading the circuits right now.
[34:21.56]Uh, sir?
[34:22.85]Where is the power supply for your thrusters?
[34:25.57]I don't know where it is.
[34:27.61]I think it's like uh in that bottom generator room you like turn it's in the generator room on the right I don't know how to fix the circuits I don't know I think I have to mark them for you oh wait I just have to stop shooting for a bit uh can someone suck this in we're right next to something
[34:54.52]Okay, but we got to turn off power to the other stuff a little bit so we can do that comfortably.
[34:58.81]Okay, I turned off the pilot.
[35:00.49]Get it.
[35:01.53]No, no, I turned off something else.
[35:02.63]The ship.
[35:03.31]The gun.
[35:05.29]Oh, shit.
[35:06.61]I'm so stressed out.
[35:07.57]Sir, you can see we're at six of six.
[35:09.06]If we go above that, we can trip circuits.
[35:11.06]Where does it show six of six?
[35:13.24]Below your health, I think.
[35:15.66]The ship, top left.
[35:16.78]You see six of six?
[35:17.70]The hull's fucked.
[35:18.71]Yes.
[35:21.11]Are we ready to go engage?
[35:23.05]Or is the hull fucked?
[35:25.17]bottom bar shows deviation bullets what medium range weapon system with normal fire rate okay uh do we really need all like I don't even know what we're picking up nano alloy cluster to our right I see it anomalous jump signature detected
[35:55.49]okay I'm going straight for are we taking this I don't know how to deploy this there's a target out this way I want to make a missile Jerm check this out oh
[36:10.56]We just got a new missile bay, actually.
[36:13.50]Ooh.
[36:14.63]Confessor Carbonite.
[36:16.09]Carbonite Mark I. So the thing is, though, we need to power this up, and it costs a lot of power.
[36:21.95]That's three power.
[36:23.17]Hey, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, come downstairs real quick.
[36:25.66]Downstairs.
[36:27.16]Oh, that's the six out of six.
[36:28.90]These twisty thingies are the thruster boosters.
[36:32.46]What the hell is this?
[36:36.35]Those have been without power the whole time.
[36:39.27]Yeah, I know.
[36:40.03]Um...
[36:49.05]so this is how we do this I'll take care of some of this stuff so I'm taking the alloy that we got from the suck and I'm recycling them into credits so we can buy cool include we need more power yeah we need way more power do we have like a better gun I feel like I picked up a missile launcher or something uh yes I have that we haven't installed it captain
[37:18.15]Electrical hazard.
[37:19.75]Okay.
[37:20.01]Well, Poke is doing the God's work out here.
[37:23.51]What do you mean?
[37:25.03]You have a lot of targets.
[37:28.12]How do you see that?
[37:29.66]I mean, I can see out the windows.
[37:31.56]You've been doing a lot.
[37:33.64]You need a better gun.
[37:34.66]We got to get you a better gun.
[37:36.18]Power trip.
[37:36.72]What happened?
[37:37.84]Are we dead?
[37:39.83]We were overloaded.
[37:41.79]Let me see if I can get in there and help.
[37:48.45]What happened was we were shooting with seven of six power.
[37:52.36]Oh, so me shooting?
[37:53.44]We're getting destroyed.
[37:54.68]No, no, no.
[37:55.67]Not you shooting, but we had too many stations active at the same time.
[38:00.13]Oh, okay.
[38:00.85]So we have to be careful not to overload our power.
[38:03.18]That's what I'm trying to buy is more power.
[38:05.12]So we have one of six right now.
[38:06.58]So, Poke, watch this.
[38:08.29]Over here, right?
[38:09.19]Yeah.
[38:09.95]This costs two power.
[38:11.47]You see in the top left it says one of six.
[38:13.96]Now it says three of six.
[38:16.11]Oh, okay.
[38:17.83]That's our power for the ship.
[38:19.46]So we have to make sure we're under that.
[38:21.52]If we activate this gun, this is another three.
[38:25.58]I need someone on the gun.
[38:28.43]And how do we upgrade the limit?
[38:31.27]That's what I'm trying to figure out right now.
[38:32.67]But also, we have another gun on this side now.
[38:38.22]So check this out.
[38:39.26]If we activate this...
[38:41.85]We get a whole new weapon system on the right side.
[38:43.97]What's the right side, starboard?
[38:45.43]Doesn't matter.
[38:48.69]There will be no use of starboard on my ship.
[38:52.82]On it?
[38:54.64]I'm gonna try the, I'm gonna try the coronade thing.
[39:02.94]I think we're okay.
[39:05.21]We're pulling up to avoid conduit.
[39:07.75]We are being chased by many fighters.
[39:10.80]I'm getting additional power.
[39:13.11]We're almost out of alloys.
[39:15.71]I don't know what that means.
[39:16.83]The reason.
[39:18.27]Yeah, the reason we're almost out of alloys.
[39:19.62]I need someone on the gun.
[39:21.44]Upgraded power.
[39:22.06]Going back.
[39:22.78]Pocus on a gun.
[39:25.04]What is an alloy?
[39:27.09]Going back to my gun.
[39:28.67]Oh, I'm unpowered.
[39:29.57]Oh, somebody else.
[39:30.35]Oh, why is it on fire?
[39:34.07]Oh, my God.
[39:34.41]Repair.
[39:36.98]Are we good?
[39:37.32]Good job.
[39:37.72]Good.
[39:42.16]port is left because they have four letters oh wow that's actually really useful thank you it's too many syllables put it in the three power weapon this is a three power weapon look at all this I gotta deal with drop anything
[40:10.66]there's a lot of bullets firing at us what is what is how do I third person oh yeah third person's very very useful am I hitting us no I am I'm helping I think I was running our ship where's our power top left starboard thing there power's top left Jeremy see where it says six of six yeah that's yeah that's us
[40:39.33]So we can't, I can't turn on any more stuff.
[40:42.11]You can, but you risk tripping circuits.
[40:44.10]So in an emergency, it's good to consider the option.
[40:47.28]But I found just now that going over six kind of sucks.
[40:52.07]Hey, by the way, what is he even doing up here?
[40:56.12]Me?
[40:56.36]You're just like kind of sitting there.
[41:00.79]I'm flying the shit.
[41:02.14]Why is the suck device on?
[41:04.30]Oh, I turned it on for a second.
[41:05.20]We got a weird sniper trying to shoot us.
[41:06.82]I need the thrusters charged.
[41:08.32]The gravity scoop?
[41:09.44]I turned it on for a second to see it.
[41:10.73]Okay.
[41:11.35]What it does.
[41:12.03]I need the thrusters charging.
[41:13.57]Oh, is that a big monster?
[41:14.93]Yeah.
[41:21.38]This thruster is messed up.
[41:25.02]This would shoot faster if it wasn't empty.
[41:27.00]How do you get this not empty?
[41:31.47]So how do we see the loot from the monsters?
[41:34.52]You'll see them on the map when you shoot.
[41:36.96]Not on the map, on the world.
[41:39.46]We've been picking up everything.
[41:40.96]Got that thruster locked in.
[41:47.41]Wait.
[41:48.17]Uh-oh.
[41:49.17]Recharge a battery and plug it in.
[41:51.52]You can do that.
[41:54.50]Sir, turn more right.
[41:55.92]Got that one charged up.
[41:57.90]No, that's left.
[41:59.89]we need this thing dead first I can't hit this real quick oh should I move to almost what if I move my gun over there yeah Jerma would you be able to charge my battery on this guy am I confused we have a gun shooting from that side yeah we do but I can take it help uh there's no battery in this thing okay never mind but how about I just do that is this is our better gun oh yeah we got this week ah yeah Jerma how'd you do that
[42:28.06]ah just a little thing called engineering you know nice dude now these guys are dropping loot I'm understanding the game a lot now I get it this is a good game oh yeah this this was a lot of fun now I'm remembering I'm gonna need those thrusters flipped yeah
[42:52.86]I think this is our last one we need to get before we're done here you need to get me a little closer
[43:25.75]All integrity below 80%.
[43:30.48]Power overload.
[43:31.34]Something's shooting from the back.
[43:32.54]Oh.
[43:33.70]Oh.
[43:34.20]Oh.
[43:34.52]That.
[43:34.80]We need.
[43:35.18]Okay.
[43:35.32]Kill this as quick as you can.
[43:36.36]And then Jerma, charge the void.
[43:38.29]Charge the void.
[43:39.03]Killed.
[43:39.85]Oh my God.
[43:40.55]What is this?
[43:40.97]What is that behind us?
[43:41.99]Charging.
[43:42.33]Jerma, charge the void.
[43:43.25]Charging.
[43:43.77]I'm charging.
[43:44.41]It's charging.
[43:45.04]We got to get the fuck out of here right now.
[43:46.64]23%.
[43:46.86]25%.
[43:47.06]26%.
[43:47.32]27%.
[43:47.52]28%.
[43:48.38]29%.
[43:49.84]Keep resetting the thrusters too.
[43:51.32]We need thrusters.
[43:53.29]Should I shoot the monster?
[43:54.21]I got to turn the gun off.
[43:55.60]we kill him I want to see a monster we're just evading right now I'm playing Simon says over here thrusters is it cool we're gonna die we're gonna die we're gonna die we're gonna die we took too long well now we know how to play yeah oh we took you know what it was that was the countdown timer so we we just took a little too long but
[44:23.21]We're good now.
[44:23.77]We got this.
[44:24.77]That was fun.
[44:25.47]That was fun.
[44:27.28]Alright.
[44:27.56]Yeah, no, I think that was some hustle.
[44:29.82]Oh, and we get loot?
[44:31.20]Loot?
[44:33.43]That was a lot of fun.
[44:34.27]That was for their boys back home, huh?
[44:40.28]I just got to say, I have absolutely no idea any of the things that I did.
[44:45.70]I just pressed buttons when E popped up and when people yelled at me.
[44:50.48]Somehow, though, you managed to get my weapon more powerful.
[44:55.31]So, I mean, you're doing something, right?
[44:57.69]I tossed you a little bit.
[44:59.37]Yeah.
[45:01.14]Is that really for the boys back home?
[45:03.08]No, no.
[45:04.16]Okay.
[45:05.12]I was joking.
[45:05.66]I just wanted you to laugh.
[45:12.29]Alright, so now you can go to the terminal.
[45:15.98]You guys may have a little bit more...
[45:19.34]options to customize.
[45:27.18]Yeah, there's loot boxes.
[45:28.81]Man, I can really express myself and my individuality.
[45:32.73]Sense of pride and accomplishment.
[45:35.29]No freaking way, man.
[45:37.47]Armor color?
[45:41.36]Guys, I have the PP if that's cool.
[45:43.50]One second.
[45:44.24]It's not.
[45:44.70]So sorry.
[45:45.48]I know.
[45:45.72]But we'll wait.
[45:46.42]I know, I know.
[45:47.54]That's one for the boys back home.
[45:52.02]You can't be saying that, Vinny.
[45:53.73]I don't know what it means.
[45:54.71]Is this a thing?
[45:55.33]Exactly.
[45:56.39]Alright, never mind.
[45:57.45]I'll just stop.
[45:59.56]What are you guys up to?
[46:00.44]You know not what you do.
[46:09.29]Oh, that's cute.
[46:26.65]that ship was nice it was a little tiny it was a little like cute like it had a nice like cinch in the middle I got some extra points in my carry the power cell so I said please don't play engineer again
[46:55.95]we can work on engineering together Jerma I I get it I figured I think you I think you get it now I think we all kind of get it now I wish there were more ships though because there's only two ships one is too big and one is too small like I remember that last time I played this game we tried the big ship and I was like holy this thing's huge yeah me and you wouldn't work out then
[47:26.17]I don't yes I am back so when we collect those things we need to put them into the crafter and because in the tutorial you fabricate a bunch of stuff yeah fabricate ammo fabricate we're gonna do some fabricating oh I got a loot box
[47:45.71]yeah you do you do some fabrication and then you get another genetic point for your engineering as well oh yeah that's right yeah if I just hold on to the if I like I guess I physically pick them up whoa they charge if I'm holding them so I might have got the best helmet in the game you already got your bis I think so let me see that's fire
[48:17.52]that ain't that ain't this no how do you change your um how you change your helmet icon um it should be oh me and poker the dogs top right is the icon oh there it is there's one there's one that says always be scooping yeah look at mine it's okay if you guys get jealous it's not a big deal
[48:48.86]You got the eyes?
[48:50.54]Yeah.
[48:51.98]Oh, those are great.
[48:54.10]Thanks.
[48:54.40]What do you have, Jerma?
[48:55.30]Does it say time to fish?
[48:57.25]Mine says it's fire.
[48:59.01]This is fine.
[49:00.11]What?
[49:01.11]It says this is fine.
[49:02.07]It says this is fine, not this is fire.
[49:06.56]Oh.
[49:07.74]I thought it said this is fire.
[49:11.95]I don't want to say that.
[49:15.19]Yeah, that's fine.
[49:17.41]I have a fist bump.
[49:18.94]I think we're ready for another one.
[49:20.59]I'm going to say let's use the small ship again just so we can get used to all the stuff.
[49:26.07]Alright, I'm going to put it on hard.
[49:28.42]Wait, why?
[49:30.48]What's the difference?
[49:31.02]What does my ability power do?
[49:36.89]Increases the damage of your abilities.
[49:39.21]Oh, this is like a lobby.
[49:42.33]Are we going to play League of Legends one day?
[49:43.53]All of us?
[49:43.99]What the hell?
[49:45.30]Yeah, we're doing a...
[49:48.19]uh no turning off the stream until grandmaster or at least at least diamond I'd rather drink all the chemicals under the sink than play that game for an hour I've been to your house this dude keeps his orange juice under the sink he's it's there's nothing he's not like threatening anything
[50:11.27]Yeah, no, I think my audience seeing me play League would be like seeing a triple rainbow.
[50:17.24]It just doesn't happen.
[50:22.43]I think it'd be funny.
[50:25.01]I mean, I would play it with you guys as a bit.
[50:29.00]I don't think it's a good idea.
[50:30.28]This door is... Oh, no ship selected.
[50:33.99]Terrible idea.
[50:34.97]No ship selected, huh?
[50:36.77]I got it.
[50:38.17]I don't think I could think of a more unfun thing to do.
[50:47.01]Wait, how do you use the grapple?
[50:48.71]That's only my class, I think.
[50:51.97]Oh.
[50:56.20]Oh.
[50:57.96]It'd be perfect.
[50:58.58]Like all four of us can go bot lane.
[51:02.29]Someone said in my chat, seeing Vin play League would be like watching my dad walk out of my life again.
[51:07.89]damn wow yeah I just wanted to say that and bring the mood down well then at least you'd get to see him one last time oh man positivity positivity positivity stop yeah Ster come on Ster tell that chat member not to say things like that anymore he's upsetting everyone I think me and him are on the same page I don't know
[51:38.23]okay so the we have one power cell that we get to play with that which is highly corrosive reactive uh we charge it up we can only use it in one place right one place so probably the gunning area I would imagine what happens if we throw this outside the map the homunculus oh no we need that to even start the ship yeah that that powers the ship
[52:09.16]We can fabricate more power cells.
[52:11.25]I guess we can make more of them.
[52:14.39]Yeah, that would be really good if we could make that happen.
[52:16.45]Yeah, where is it?
[52:17.63]Systems offline?
[52:18.56]This way, Jeremy.
[52:19.44]Oh, I have it.
[52:21.24]I'll turn it on.
[52:22.76]Should I turn on the computer right now?
[52:24.52]Yeah.
[52:24.64]It's not down there.
[52:27.03]We are in, like, waiting.
[52:28.67]We need to avoid travel to the first mission.
[52:30.95]So this is, like, you know, setup time.
[52:33.19]Figure it out.
[52:36.36]We should get more than one.
[52:41.43]Wait, you can have gunners in the back of the ship?
[52:44.45]We kind of.
[52:46.05]You have anything there really?
[52:46.92]Minor power cell.
[52:49.76]We need four nano alloy.
[52:51.98]We can make a minor power cell.
[52:53.51]Oh yeah, you can, huh?
[52:56.97]So that's definitely priority one.
[52:59.77]We can make that now, Jerm?
[53:01.62]No, we need three more alloys.
[53:06.64]Okay.
[53:06.89]Yeah, let's get them alloys.
[53:10.29]That'd be cool.
[53:12.44]would be up to the captain decide where we're gonna go wait does this have ammo the the benediction cannon so it looks like um oh it uses no ammo okay this one though the confessor it says it uses power cells to be better okay got it okay
[53:41.91]so power just makes this do more damage but it looks like benediction does better damage against no shields and level one I don't think things had shields okay sir check this out you see this yeah payload launcher I could put a missile in there and it says here prioritizes target locks set by the pilot yep
[54:07.34]So if you lock on a target, we can get out.
[54:10.14]One of us can load a missile directly in here and then just press the button and shoot out into space.
[54:15.39]Okay.
[54:15.91]We could try doing that on the first big target.
[54:19.26]I mean, I could do that.
[54:20.02]You could just lock on and be like, wait, we need a missile guy, though, to launch it, like get it ready, no?
[54:28.01]I think you need to load it and then somebody has to press the activate button on the right yeah you just go like that we'll figure it out when the time one guy does it I think maybe Vinny I mean I'll take care of that sure yeah I I pressed it last time and it seemed to do a lot of damage to something jump escape vector set alright guys we need everyone to strap in if we're ready oh yeah chairs that's right oh there's more shelves here by the way guys
[54:56.34]If you need more... You got chairs?
[54:58.35]There's a chair here.
[55:00.13]If you need more storage, there's shelves up here.
[55:03.77]I didn't even notice that.
[55:04.69]Okay.
[55:08.56]I had three glasses of gin.
[55:09.52]It's only fair for you to have three glasses as well.
[55:11.66]We'll do that on Saturday.
[55:13.50]Do we have to sit down for this?
[55:18.10]Yeah, you gotta sit down or you're gonna die.
[55:21.39]I'm gonna sit down in the cannon.
[55:22.83]Yeah, that'll work.
[55:30.45]three two one woo no deaths we're good see we're better can we get up now uh no I don't think so I think when we appear back in the next spot everybody okay crashes again what's gonna happen I'm gonna choose a mission and then we're gonna sit back down because then there's another jump so I'm gonna go for normal again
[56:00.40]okay okay now sit yeah now we sit again we're all seated yep here we go boys you know what they say I like comedy alright captain Ster
[56:30.24]yes you have the ability to scan yes I usually am scanning the closest thing we got a container over here uh this place is looking a little bit dangerous to fly around in this looks like we're in the you know some kind of planet exploded here like someone maybe Goku maybe Vegeta can crew members get a third person view chat of the ship or no
[57:04.58]boosters are charging I'm here we're pulling up on a container I think that's I think people have to like get out of the ship for these I'll um well you can we've got three containers here and you know these are like really big ones I think we have to shoot these to open them as well wait what airlock open circle right guys there's periscopes we can use these oh god guys these oh these that's awesome
[57:36.39]Is that a laser battery?
[57:43.99]We got to hurry, guys.
[57:45.74]Oh, yeah, you're right.
[57:46.34]So we're going to shoot those, yeah?
[57:47.78]Alright.
[57:48.26]Yeah.
[57:52.78]You got it.
[57:55.39]Yeah, I think we got to shoot them all, and then we can probably suck whatever comes out.
[57:59.31]It looks like we have way less targets than last time.
[58:01.74]This feels like an actual level one.
[58:08.35]Didn't you put hard mode?
[58:10.54]Nah, I was doing jokes.
[58:13.61]Wait, so we were on hard mode before?
[58:15.27]That's why it was so crazy?
[58:16.96]No, we just got a hard mission and we waited too long and we didn't know what we were doing.
[58:23.84]So should I fly out there and get it, or do you just suck it up?
[58:27.20]Other side of the ship has the suck.
[58:29.33]So you can do the suck.
[58:30.31]I'm actually going to get out there in my jet pack as well.
[58:33.41]My job is scavenger, so I think I can do this.
[58:35.99]Let's see.
[58:36.33]I have never tried scavenger before.
[58:38.08]I'm going to watch you from the periscope.
[58:39.92]Yeah, I'm watching the outside.
[58:41.34]I'm going to applaud.
[58:43.80]Let's all watch.
[58:45.03]Good luck, Vinny.
[58:51.17]Thanks.
[58:53.57]I think get me a little closer or get the ship a little closer, sir.
[58:56.14]If you can.
[58:56.84]Yeah, I'm going to just, I'm going to trail.
[59:07.29]What if we left them here as a prank?
[59:09.63]It'd be funny.
[59:10.82]Yeah.
[59:11.00]We got to suck these because I can only get one at a time.
[59:13.90]I don't mind doing that, but here.
[59:18.18]There's no way he'll take the full brunt of a star.
[59:21.31]Give us a good turn so they can chuck.
[59:26.50]Vinny went back out.
[59:28.26]Vinny said I shouldn't go back out, and then he went back out.
[59:31.06]I'll do it.
[59:34.13]You can do both.
[59:36.11]I mean, whatever you want to do, I can make this work.
[59:38.81]I have a lot of mobility out here.
[59:41.41]Go grab the furthest one, the purple one.
[59:44.46]And we'll get the sucks on the close ones.
[59:47.24]Can Pope crack your password in one minute?
[59:50.23]Jerma?
[59:51.55]Anyone suck?
[59:52.63]Anyone sucking?
[59:54.67]Sucking right now?
[59:56.33]Turning on the suck?
[59:57.21]Wait, we're overpowered, no?
[60:00.61]Now we're six of six, we're good.
[60:03.68]And then activation?
[60:09.66]We got materials right here.
[60:14.21]The sucking should be sucking.
[60:15.67]There you go.
[60:17.47]Alright, you got it.
[60:18.51]We have one more, then we got to pick up Vinny and then we got to go fight for the Empire.
[60:24.11]where's the empire though I like I've been trying to figure that out oh god I'm turning off the scooper right no we're sucking one more shoot oh shoot oh data shard minefield oh god we're gonna kill ourselves sucker's sucking oh cool dude you're good at that thank you I'm practicing
[60:49.47]this game does lead to this kind of conversation doesn't it just kind of naturally alright are we building anything or should I start flying towards the enemy we should make another power whatever it is um here you guys handle that me and poke are gonna shoot yeah you shooting a Jerm let's start yeah cycle we need some alloy
[61:18.78]wait our objective is raid storage site alright we have another power ammo resource I don't even see a storage site unless this is the enemies are guarding it where the enemy's at can we uh have shifter or thrusting boosts turned on yep I don't know what to do with that
[61:49.56]Wait, I just think I found an expert.
[61:50.52]Wait, wasn't it already on?
[61:51.32]Huh?
[61:51.68]Oh, wait.
[61:53.25]I was hitting us.
[61:58.77]Oh, never mind.
[62:04.86]Thrusters are already good.
[62:07.06]What, um... Chad, is there a way to see what systems are being used currently?
[62:17.42]stop void resetting oh hey can we shoot down Charlie there Charlie bravo it's a random module you can place to recycle and learn crap damn dude some good crates out there fellas yeah let's clean this up and loot up
[62:47.39]These ones are closer.
[62:48.31]Are they on which side of the ship?
[62:51.20]Are they on their own?
[62:52.22]They're playing into us.
[62:54.44]Everyone's on left.
[62:58.71]Getting it.
[63:00.55]Unpowered what?
[63:06.52]You can flip it to get some power.
[63:12.95]That's the wrong machine.
[63:17.82]oh there's a bunch of shit in here oh yeah we do have stuff I'm moving us towards the asteroid there's a turret on it someone a minor field of met in proximity mines to your current location uh ads are gonna start trying the missile on this turret it's got I might take a break here bud we might be in the middle of this I want to waste a starter in about a minute to learn
[63:46.37]I wanna, I wanna learn.
[63:48.43]Okay, load the missile.
[63:54.48]Ready?
[63:55.48]Yeah.
[63:55.72]Direct clear.
[64:04.80]Uh, jump is charged.
[64:08.00]That was cool.
[64:08.98]Whoa!
[64:10.53]It took no damage.
[64:11.95]Yeah, it didn't do shit.
[64:12.93]That's awesome.
[64:13.63]Whoa, what is this thing?
[64:18.10]Are we going to mine the asteroid?
[64:21.10]Is this on our team?
[64:22.18]Oh no, you're shooting it.
[64:23.22]Oh, new gravity scoop.
[64:27.51]Wait, no animus crate arc shield Mark one.
[64:31.05]It's weird.
[64:31.50]OK, you have to go outside and get inside this building or something a little higher.
[64:40.56]yeah get it get it get it get yeah wait stop shooting that poke I feel like we can take this over or something it's not shooting back yeah you're right I'm in and if there's quantum data logs okay there's um some power issues here I'm gonna try to repair the thing I think
[65:06.10]uh someone else can go out with Vinny we might be here a while if you want to learn that hole I'm gonna try to go out there we should all go out there just don't just trying to die alright yeah ads are about to start right now you guys need a hand I'll show you just wanted to warn you
[65:28.85]you guys have to have both doors closed you open the interior door you get in get in both of you and then you have to shut the interior door and then those things give you oxygen you have to put on the backpack or you'll die and then you open you depressurize and then you can leave let's go oh this is cool
[65:59.02]We can now access the secure storage facilities.
[66:02.25]Okay.
[66:03.13]Right in here, fellas.
[66:05.27]This is a way cooler mission than the other one.
[66:07.58]There's going to be an alarm.
[66:10.74]As soon as we get in here, we've got to get out fast.
[66:13.78]Oh, the turret's on now.
[66:15.19]It's shooting at us, I think.
[66:16.89]Oh, never mind.
[66:17.51]It just turned.
[66:20.03]I'm the ship turning.
[66:22.72]Okay.
[66:23.08]The turret I was shooting at is now moving.
[66:26.34]Remember?
[66:26.73]Okay, yeah, it is starting to shoot me.
[66:31.26]Okay, coming back, I'm coming back.
[66:33.30]Well, um, maybe, uh, there's some stuff here we can grab and bring to the ship.
[66:36.98]What the fuck is this?
[66:38.43]I'll take this.
[66:38.83]Quantum data shard.
[66:40.93]Okay, I am out of its line of sight.
[66:43.25]You coming in?
[66:44.07]I'm coming.
[66:48.48]Yeah, there's one more item here, Poke.
[66:51.18]Heavy torpedo.
[66:53.42]I'll just come back and get it.
[66:55.24]I might be able to how do I get back in the ship the front of the ship the one that's facing the the island now okay you mean the back of the ship oh no the front you're right sorry yeah no it's like a mouth it gobbles you up alright I gotta pee as well the torpedo is that we got uh bad timing can you get that torpedo I got an item we got uh we got enemies coming in two kilometers behind us
[67:25.80]Vinny.
[67:27.24]Vinny Poke, we need you on board.
[67:28.56]I'm trying to come.
[67:29.02]I'm trying to come.
[67:29.44]I don't know what that thing is, but it's cool.
[67:31.86]He's trying to come.
[67:32.88]I'm coming.
[67:33.23]I'm coming.
[67:33.47]I'm coming.
[67:34.21]I'm stuck.
[67:35.33]Where are the enemies?
[67:35.97]I got it.
[67:36.25]I'll shoot.
[67:38.21]They're on the wrong side of the ship.
[67:39.23]I need to turn the ship.
[67:40.17]Poke, once you're in, I'm turning.
[67:42.10]I'm ready to shoot.
[67:43.88]Let him in.
[67:44.54]Let him in.
[67:44.98]And I'm... Let him in.
[67:50.63]Let him in.
[67:51.73]We're good.
[67:52.03]We're good.
[67:57.77]Alright.
[67:59.54]Nice work.
[68:03.18]Are we missing quantum data logs?
[68:06.46]I think we have both.
[68:09.19]How do we know?
[68:09.67]At the top of the screen it says access the vault and there's two.
[68:12.95]Okay, we have to leave.
[68:13.85]That was actually... That's the big guy.
[68:18.59]I need the thrusters charged as much as possible.
[68:21.78]I think the reclaimer is something we can't beat.
[68:24.59]Yeah.
[68:25.11]No, that's the time is up.
[68:26.97]Yeah, okay.
[68:29.43]No, I'm not going to turn the oxygen off.
[68:30.98]Not right now.
[68:33.08]I don't know where our void exit is.
[68:37.36]Charge the void, Jerma.
[68:38.78]I think we just don't have it charged.
[68:40.91]I think we're going to die again.
[68:42.21]How do you charge the void?
[68:43.91]It is charged.
[68:44.45]I think I know how to do it.
[68:49.85]The escape vector is not set.
[68:51.09]We don't have like a target.
[68:52.21]Set escape vector.
[68:53.12]Jumping away from the objective while active will result in failure.
[68:56.60]But it says retrieve quantum data shards.
[68:58.79]Didn't we do this?
[69:02.65]Quantum data shard.
[69:03.94]Place an astral map to extract data.
[69:05.74]We got to place these.
[69:08.90]The people coming back from the ad break, I want to do something funny.
[69:15.84]There's one.
[69:18.76]There's one.
[69:19.50]There's two.
[69:20.26]Where's two?
[69:21.11]I don't know.
[69:22.91]I don't know what to do.
[69:23.73]I don't know what to do.
[69:25.13]It's moving so fast.
[69:26.01]I don't know what to do.
[69:27.69]Okay, they're fighting that turret, so they stopped it back there.
[69:31.88]We don't have the second data shard.
[69:35.11]You didn't get a second data shard, did you?
[69:38.43]No, I got a torpedo.
[69:41.70]Data shard.
[69:42.54]You got to go back there.
[69:44.54]There...
[69:45.94]on top of it we'll get it done we're on top of it are we on top of it right now yeah they're like they are like on the asteroid no no we are not on top of it they are four kilometers away if we go there we're dead left there's another quantum hey what about this decoy minefield we need quantum data shard we can decoy the big monster I think with this thing deploys a moving decoy lure which will attract an aggro enemies in a large radius
[70:14.87]Okay, let's try that.
[70:17.11]Prime to deploy from a payload launcher module.
[70:20.57]Star, we got to go back there.
[70:22.10]I know, I'm waiting for this decoy plan because there's... Okay, where's the missile?
[70:27.52]The Death Star over there.
[70:29.18]Okay, this thing is loaded.
[70:30.71]I can launch this thing out.
[70:35.53]I say... You know the side with the missile launcher?
[70:38.68]Aim it at the enemy.
[70:42.52]Okay.
[70:43.37]Let me know when you want me to do it.
[70:45.41]Go for it.
[70:46.85]Going.
[70:48.52]Boom.
[70:49.68]Pop.
[70:53.20]It's decoying that spot right there.
[70:55.71]That might be too far, no?
[70:57.57]Might be.
[70:57.87]It's not a very large area, but... Let's just take a risk and I think we should get back there.
[71:04.58]I didn't just launch that into space, did I?
[71:13.41]okay we've got the fighters coming up on left side charge thrusters um yeah they are like still fighting the turret charge thrusters maybe just let them fight the turret and go get it and leave we do have a minefield as well we can shoot out there
[71:46.70]Got it charged thrusters.
[71:48.60]They're charged, they're good.
[71:50.95]It's telling me the boosters are not charged.
[71:53.29]They should be now.
[71:55.97]They are not.
[71:58.90]Weird.
[72:05.57]OK, I'm trying to get us there.
[72:09.83]He said he was on his phone.
[72:11.71]I think I think driving away from this might have be what uh us but I thought we had both okay we're going in hot Vinny you need to get out and just try and find this as soon as you possibly can alright you ready there's a minor power cell over here Vinny yeah alright you need to get out hang on hang on here don't don't don't don't don't whoa it's the only thing that they're fighting oh something hurts
[72:40.24]yup where are you Vinny I'm leaving we have an extra available power by the way egg type this thing has not used any power okay I'm gonna fly around while you do whatever you have to do and I'll come pick you up another gun is available by the way you can use both guns animus crate life support available uh where should I put it oh it's just this thing here
[73:12.49]Can you guys get on the suck machine?
[73:15.46]I got two things coming up.
[73:18.20]Oh, we got John.
[73:19.82]Oh, we're good.
[73:21.43]We're at seven to seven.
[73:23.15]I can't shoot.
[73:25.39]I got the data shard.
[73:27.13]Okay, I'm coming back after we pick these up.
[73:30.86]Okay, coming back for Vinny.
[73:42.16]I'm juggling two items.
[73:43.74]I don't know if we want to try to grab both of them.
[73:46.84]Just the bare minimum.
[73:48.59]We are not looking good.
[73:53.13]This turret has like one health and it's the only thing distracting them.
[73:59.64]I'm almost there, Vinny.
[74:04.52]We've got fighters if you guys can focus on shooting them.
[74:07.37]And Vinny, I'm here.
[74:13.12]sure we don't have time for another item can I turn off the sucker or no we do now you have time if you go real quick I'll go real quick they're on like the perfect opposite side of this I see them oops okay
[74:42.62]Keep thrusters charged.
[74:44.02]Quantum data shard on the ground over there.
[74:46.47]Yeah.
[74:46.81]Do whatever you have to do with the data shard so I can start trying to leave.
[74:50.71]Oh, we have a life support coming up over here as well for some suck.
[74:53.72]They like got distracted completely.
[74:56.44]Quantum.
[74:57.54]And then we have a new item over here too.
[74:59.98]Alright.
[75:00.20]Let's do quantum.
[75:01.59]So this, this one.
[75:02.57]I need sucking now.
[75:04.61]Where is the suck thing?
[75:05.89]Where's the suck machine thing?
[75:07.83]Right over here.
[75:09.30]Please.
[75:10.30]Processing contents.
[75:11.75]Suck machine on.
[75:13.57]We've retrieved all the data.
[75:15.57]Suck machine on.
[75:17.56]Alright, we got it.
[75:20.18]Good work.
[75:20.40]Suck machine on.
[75:21.74]Void jump signature detected.
[75:23.58]Incoming medum supply drop.
[75:25.62]Oh, we got another, some other stuff.
[75:27.53]Oh, okay.
[75:27.87]No, they're shooting fucking.
[75:29.63]Oh, shit.
[75:30.67]Oh, I fixed that.
[75:31.81]What do we do?
[75:32.47]What do we do?
[75:34.29]What do we do?
[75:34.78]Everyone get in a chair.
[75:35.40]Everyone get in a chair.
[75:36.00]Everyone get in a chair.
[75:36.58]Get a chair?
[75:38.46]Ooh.
[75:39.44]Wait, this is our supply drop.
[75:41.20]Why?
[75:42.02]What is this?
[75:42.44]I don't know where a fucking chair is.
[75:44.09]Wait, what?
[75:45.53]How do we get that?
[75:46.61]Menom supply drop?
[75:47.79]I'm turning on the sucker.
[75:49.07]Do we have time to get in there?
[75:51.64]I don't know.
[75:53.80]Supply drop is the reward, apparently.
[75:57.10]Oh, we kind of want that.
[75:58.89]You need to shoot it.
[75:59.89]Yeah, shoot it.
[76:01.43]I'm putting us below it so you can all shoot it.
[76:04.84]Airlock open.
[76:07.16]Call integrity below 80%.
[76:08.88]Shoot it.
[76:09.50]Shoot it.
[76:10.32]Shoot it.
[76:13.63]Guys, I don't think I have time.
[76:15.99]Their entire cruiser is right behind us.
[76:17.92]It's open.
[76:19.12]Okay.
[76:19.68]Get ready to suck this in then.
[76:20.96]There's a minigun.
[76:25.73]We can't suck for 40 seconds.
[76:26.81]We have to go out there and get it.
[76:28.33]No.
[76:29.80]We're fine.
[76:30.28]Suck.
[76:31.64]Vinny, are you on?
[76:32.68]I'm not on board yet.
[76:35.08]I'm being shot.
[76:36.79]I'm fine.
[76:37.23]I'm going to be alright.
[76:38.55]Everybody go sit down.
[76:41.35]I'm being shot on the front of the ship.
[76:43.12]I'm dead.
[76:43.84]I got shot.
[76:45.16]From where?
[76:46.16]Okay.
[76:46.86]Everybody sit down.
[76:47.98]I'm sitting.
[76:48.30]Everybody sit down.
[76:49.39]I'm sitting.
[76:49.65]Everybody sit down.
[76:55.34]Oh, wait.
[76:55.84]Is that thing going to kill us?
[76:58.68]Oh, we're fine.
[76:59.22]We're fine.
[77:01.52]You did it.
[77:05.23]Oh, my God.
[77:07.23]That was good.
[77:08.23]Yeah, we did well.
[77:10.16]We got a minigun now.
[77:12.34]That's quite the hustle.
[77:13.06]I'm going to put the minigun on the back of the ship.
[77:16.00]Yeah, I think at this part we have an infinite amount of time until we set destination.
[77:20.51]I don't know if we can go outside and repair the hull.
[77:24.49]Goes outside and dies for nothing.
[77:26.00]Yeah, basically.
[77:27.50]Yes, hull repairs would be good.
[77:29.90]I don't know if you can do that in the void.
[77:31.52]Chat, can you do that while we're jumping?
[77:34.15]What if we put this one down in the back?
[77:36.19]Life support.
[77:37.59]So I put one... I just put the minigun down there.
[77:41.48]Which you could do.
[77:42.02]You put life support next to it, no?
[77:43.58]Yeah, you could, sure.
[77:44.94]Definitely.
[77:46.09]But it might use power, right?
[77:47.35]That could be the problem.
[77:49.21]Let's see what it does.
[77:50.61]Shit, I just turned it off.
[77:53.09]Wait, what?
[77:54.29]Requires closed air locks.
[77:56.05]Wait, what does this mean?
[77:56.88]I closed the... Oh, someone closed the doors.
[77:58.98]Yeah, try now.
[78:01.78]Alright, so do this on the top of it.
[78:03.42]We got a lot of materials, right?
[78:05.96]Yeah, it seems like we can go out.
[78:08.55]Oh.
[78:09.58]Yeah, you press the top of it.
[78:10.94]You can't go out.
[78:11.86]Start the other line.
[78:12.92]It requires a perk.
[78:13.82]So we can't repair the hull until we get to the next mission.
[78:15.62]I might play Oblivion tonight.
[78:17.88]Alright.
[78:18.89]What does this do?
[78:19.99]Couple hours, maybe.
[78:22.47]What?
[78:23.89]This new machine we just got right here.
[78:25.97]So this costs... I was thinking about playing it today anyways.
[78:28.35]Two power.
[78:33.00]I want to play it.
[78:33.96]Oh, it could freeze the ship.
[78:35.34]I guess if the ship's on fire...
[78:40.12]There are miniguns on the back.
[78:44.27]That's a life support system.
[78:47.21]It's like a last hope, like, okay, we're on fire, freeze it.
[78:50.91]We already have a life support system, a basic one, but that's a better one.
[78:55.22]So I'm turning off the first life support system, and we'll use that.
[78:59.34]Wait, where's the first one?
[79:00.25]What is this thing?
[79:01.71]First one's here.
[79:04.13]What's up, Jerm?
[79:05.25]Uh...
[79:05.43]What even is this?
[79:07.78]Life support system toggle?
[79:09.34]Yeah, the life support.
[79:10.18]I'm not 100% sure what it does.
[79:11.92]Toggle mode?
[79:21.94]I think that's just oxygen.
[79:23.60]It can overheat or freeze.
[79:25.16]That's scary.
[79:28.71]Wait, are people in chat fighting over Oblivion?
[79:32.63]Relax.
[79:35.17]we're just doing whatever fucking chill out guys you want to see something cool go to a periscope looks really cool right yeah we're about to be born uh also guys just to note to note come over here we have a mini gun at the back of the ship so now Ster if you're running from an enemy yeah one of us could power this thing on costs two
[80:04.39]But then we can get in there.
[80:07.80]We can shoot.
[80:08.08]That's a comfy minigun.
[80:08.80]It looks comfy.
[80:10.48]That's like the ultimate gamer chair.
[80:15.47]Ammo depleted.
[80:19.45]Does it need a power cell?
[80:20.93]We have ammo.
[80:21.53]We have ammo.
[80:22.79]Yeah, we have.
[80:23.52]I'm bringing it.
[80:25.14]So what's the plan?
[80:25.68]Are you guys drinking bush light tonight or what?
[80:29.20]No, Saturday.
[80:30.02]Saturday.
[80:33.20]what what you having beer you got you got a beer oh Saturday's a bush light night I think I just broke the ship what no I'm not I'm not bearing uh I mean I could try something you could try something you could do yeah do whatever you want man oh you know what I'm gonna get something I'm gonna I'm gonna get a I'm gonna get a beer hang on hold on hold up hold up I'm gonna do you're gonna get a beer I know I go I hold on I gotta get my rubber band
[81:03.27]Rubber bands?
[81:04.03]Rubber band?
[81:04.87]What?
[81:05.92]Oh, I got one.
[81:12.16]Oh, I understand.
[81:15.09]The hard drug.
[81:16.77]That's crazy.
[81:17.33]I thought he was going to play with rubber bands.
[81:20.29]Nah.
[81:21.06]He's doing drugs?
[81:22.82]Yeah, he's doing heroin.
[81:24.04]That's what he's trying to say.
[81:24.90]What?
[81:25.24]What are you talking about?
[81:27.04]Who?
[81:27.14]Oh, my God.
[81:27.93]Sir, calm down.
[81:31.54]I thought we were going crazy.
[81:32.72]I thought we were busting out the bush lights.
[81:34.36]That's all I got.
[81:35.06]I'm trying to fit in.
[81:38.14]You're playing with rubber bands.
[81:40.01]They're like shooting them across the wall like a gun.
[81:42.19]You know what I mean?
[81:44.01]Why?
[81:45.13]Oh, you guys are going to drink your bush lights?
[81:46.65]I'm going to go crazy with like the finger guns.
[81:49.50]I was like, okay.
[81:51.06]Oh my god.
[81:53.80]Alright, so what's the next... Where are we going?
[81:56.93]We're ambushing a freighter is our next thing.
[82:00.68]um before we do that we can do some upgrades do you want to do that now before we get yes into the next alright guys also I put some stuff in the storage over here so we got the whole repair here just so you know if we run out of um storage right here is more shelves drama let me show you something grab that animus crate follow me down alright throw that in there in the fabricator slot
[82:29.76]And now check all those options.
[82:32.86]You see how the things that have a one are now available?
[82:36.84]Cool.
[82:38.69]Do we want one of these?
[82:39.73]These confessors?
[82:42.43]Check utility and see what we got over there.
[82:45.29]Gravity scoop.
[82:46.64]MK1.
[82:47.54]Gravity scoop.
[82:49.46]Life support.
[82:50.06]MK1.
[82:50.68]Payload launcher.
[82:52.62]Power generator.
[82:53.38]Ooh, a power generator.
[82:56.17]That's pretty huge, isn't it?
[82:57.49]We have that power generator already.
[82:59.68]But we probably would want to mark two and then replace that one with it.
[83:06.52]You know what I mean?
[83:07.52]Because we need... Animus crate rarity is too low.
[83:12.41]I really like saying M-K-I-I personally.
[83:16.11]Jerm, if we find one more blank Animus crate, we can get the mark twos.
[83:20.92]So maybe we hold off.
[83:22.12]What do you think?
[83:24.22]I think we want the better one, don't we?
[83:28.50]Yeah, I think so.
[83:32.21]So that's just a mechanic I wanted to show you about.
[83:36.80]Animus Crate Thruster Booster Station Mark 1 makes additional thruster booster charges available to the pilot.
[83:47.99]I'm here.
[83:48.43]And Arc Shield, it absorbs incoming projectile damage.
[83:52.32]Which one would you want, Ster?
[83:54.57]I was not listening I'm leaving all of the ship decisions up to everyone I'm making the macro decisions on ship navigation oh I can't look at that right now really I'm gonna get you shields what about the gun so you have just the new gun in the back that's it new mini gun in the back uh we do still have the missile launcher there's also mods so we can upgrade the guns oh we need more alloy we need more alloy okay oh
[84:25.05]Let that be the first thing we do then.
[84:28.49]The better benediction cannon.
[84:29.59]I like benediction cannon.
[84:31.90]I like that one.
[84:34.36]Minus 30 alloy.
[84:35.68]Oh, I see.
[84:36.32]Okay.
[84:36.90]Got it.
[84:37.40]Stock up on minigun ammo while you're in the void.
[84:39.93]You go through it quickly, but it's powerful.
[84:42.29]I put in another one that we had.
[84:45.05]There's two already loaded.
[84:46.44]Wait, wait.
[84:46.84]I have an idea.
[84:47.80]We have alloy.
[84:50.78]We could put the in here and then break it down.
[84:54.91]oh and we could turn it into a heavy torpedo do we want that um two alloy and we learned the blueprint yeah it could be worth it do it yeah do it are you able to like load the missile now or does it need to be activated from here I think you can probably load it now
[85:24.40]That's our only missile left, but at some point what we could do is we could deconstruct this station and we could put something else here if we run out of missiles.
[85:32.50]So that's good.
[85:33.41]That's a good thing.
[85:35.13]Also, if we run out of power, guys, we can go to this battery over here and we can use the enhancement.
[85:40.51]So remember the enhancement terminals are really good.
[85:44.76]But they're just limited.
[85:46.32]Like plus one on the seven?
[85:48.18]So that'll give us plus one over here for the vacuum suck.
[85:51.02]That'll give us extra range and extra velocity.
[85:54.53]um let's see so are we is this effectively a run that we're doing yeah it's like a robot okay I see yeah hold on a second wait the wait what the enhancement panel is that connected to this at all that specific one yeah um this power which one
[86:16.34]The power generator is just separate, right?
[86:18.38]That's separate, but that'll give the whole ship plus one power for 120 seconds.
[86:22.84]Just in case we need that extra little push.
[86:26.97]Okay.
[86:30.09]So, Ster, here's what we should do.
[86:31.99]When we get to our destination, I'm going to go out and repair the hull.
[86:36.74]I think everybody should.
[86:39.04]Okay.
[86:39.54]I think it'll be a fun little morale building.
[86:42.19]Everybody lines up at the...
[86:45.38]Is it airlock?
[86:47.04]Yeah.
[86:48.12]Take everybody outside.
[86:49.48]Okay.
[86:50.40]Are we there yet?
[86:51.95]We need everyone to sit down.
[86:53.89]Oh, close airlock?
[86:55.99]Ster, come here.
[86:56.45]Ready?
[86:57.43]Three.
[86:58.05]On the chair.
[86:58.37]Ready?
[86:58.55]Three.
[86:59.71]Wait.
[87:00.05]Yeah.
[87:00.36]Three.
[87:01.32]Two.
[87:02.30]One.
[87:04.16]Not this again.
[87:04.70]Again.
[87:04.90]Again.
[87:05.74]Three.
[87:07.24]Well, I don't know if I want go or one.
[87:10.85]Yeah.
[87:11.21]I thought it took longer to charge.
[87:13.37]Are we ready?
[87:14.29]I'll stand.
[87:15.79]don't stand can I be in any chair yeah the gun okay I'm good jump us I'll stand as like the yeah yeah I'd win what was that noise three two one I don't know is this screaming through the void alright we are ambushing a freighter it is
[87:45.20]Three kilometers away.
[87:46.06]Everybody outside to repair.
[87:47.40]You got it, Captain.
[87:50.81]Okay.
[87:51.93]Vinny, you're supposed to be leading this expedition.
[87:53.75]Take everyone outside.
[87:54.65]I got this, buddy.
[87:56.58]Where are the repair kits?
[87:58.14]I won't forget you, buddy.
[87:59.38]We got one hull repair plate.
[88:04.43]We need... Did we break this down or no?
[88:07.67]We might not need a couple others.
[88:08.88]Let's take a look first.
[88:09.94]I'm not sure how this works.
[88:11.30]Okay, let's assess the damage.
[88:13.36]Yeah.
[88:16.72]Everybody in the pressurizer.
[88:20.45]Hold on.
[88:23.66]Oh, guys!
[88:25.59]You can still come out.
[88:26.47]You just gotta do the thing.
[88:27.59]Yeah, I'll do the thing.
[88:30.59]um the suck is currently on by the way and wasting a lot of power I'm turning off the suck then I I'm okay I didn't know you're still in here um where's our damage does anyone know uh on the top near the front oh it's up top here
[88:51.91]minor hull breach are you able to repair that without the repair kit got it oh good we're done we don't even need to use the repair kit okay how do we heal the rest of that later then that's probably an item I would imagine okay everybody in I love that I can see where you all are like through the ship in the the pilot view well what if I want to use the jetpack just hanging out
[89:19.92]It's slower, but you can do it.
[89:25.45]Vin, look at the bottom right.
[89:26.79]Place on major hull breaches to allow hull repairs.
[89:30.01]Oh, that's what this does.
[89:30.97]Okay.
[89:32.11]Wow.
[89:32.63]That looks like a movie right there.
[89:34.26]F12.
[89:34.50]Let me dodge this thing.
[89:40.18]You don't like that?
[89:40.88]I liked it a lot.
[89:42.69]You said F12?
[89:43.53]Like a screenshot?
[89:45.59]Yeah.
[89:49.18]you just have a great delivery poke honestly down here thank you uh can we charge the thrusters I'm charging I know I'm like I'm like a broken record up here thrusters are all charged support on we did yeah we didn't have life support on
[90:14.65]Oh, I am good.
[90:17.43]I don't.
[90:17.97]We're looking for a freighter.
[90:19.27]I don't see anything that looks like a freighter.
[90:22.75]Look for a large thing.
[90:26.22]There's one target 15 kilometers away in the other direction.
[90:31.60]Like opposite of where we started that it could be.
[90:35.07]And then there's also a really good aesthetic.
[90:38.75]We're right next to the satellite.
[90:39.95]If you want to get outside Vinny or others and like loot it.
[90:44.55]Okay, I gotcha.
[90:46.27]Go loot it.
[90:52.96]What the hell?
[90:53.88]We're not close yet.
[90:54.82]500 meters.
[90:57.10]I'll prepare my body in various ways.
[91:01.85]Did you ever see the expanse?
[91:02.57]Yeah, we're pretty much there.
[91:03.95]Anyone?
[91:04.69]Yeah, I've seen it all.
[91:06.25]I love that show.
[91:08.28]I like the way the belters talk.
[91:09.54]We the belters!
[91:11.44]Delta Loda.
[91:12.32]Delta Loda.
[91:14.45]Wait, what show is this?
[91:15.79]It's goofy until you watch like 10 hours of the show and then you're like, oh yeah, that's normal.
[91:19.80]Wait, what is this?
[91:21.72]What show?
[91:22.40]The Expanse.
[91:24.02]It's like a space show.
[91:25.40]It's really, really good.
[91:26.94]Are we going out there?
[91:30.53]I'm going to go out there and repair some defects if anyone wants to join.
[91:33.87]Yeah, we got some work to do in here.
[91:35.35]Yeah, we got time if you guys don't want to go.
[91:38.66]Okay, so when you see the defects, go up to them and press F and then you can repair them.
[91:45.01]Egg type has left the ship.
[91:47.37]Dude, this thing is crazy looking.
[91:50.54]Imagine there were alien life forms out there like this.
[91:56.62]I think about that a lot.
[91:58.08]Like aliens occupy like way too much space in my brain.
[92:02.07]Yeah.
[92:07.47]Alright, power's on here.
[92:08.37]Was I supposed to do that?
[92:11.07]There's an electrified field here.
[92:12.77]don't think I was supposed to turn the power uh turn the power off and see if I can go through this yeah alright yeah power is now off okay now power it again oh I'll go okay I'll go I got it you guys go okay you're the loot you're the scavenger you know you're fine that's true you can just grab items and like toss them through and I'll grab them and place them in the ship
[92:42.76]This place was abandoned.
[92:43.54]Activating this.
[92:46.30]Oh, wait.
[92:46.60]What if that, like... Oh, there's going to be a data shard.
[92:51.57]Ooh, I got some alcohol on this thing.
[92:58.84]Another data shard.
[93:03.67]What if it breaks in that lightning?
[93:06.06]Five.
[93:07.28]okay guys the freighter is showing up in 40 seconds you guys activated it we need to go oh I guess yeah I'll turn it off how many items are there I threw it that was my fault the door is open so we don't need to worry about the power thing anymore so oh cool 20 seconds we got everything let's get out whatever items there are I'm throwing them in
[93:41.95]is there anything in all sorts you got the other stuff I think we got it alright double checking yeah it's good there's the data shard out here we don't need that attention I got the data shard everybody in everybody in ah
[94:00.58]I'm sorry.
[94:01.97]That's fucking awkward.
[94:03.57]Captain, what's going to happen?
[94:04.81]What are you doing?
[94:05.74]800 meters.
[94:06.42]The ships are jumping in.
[94:08.44]They were attracted to the satellite.
[94:10.15]You guys activate it.
[94:10.97]We need to combat.
[94:12.69]Yeah, no, it was a lure.
[94:15.70]So I think a lure lured them in.
[94:17.56]Frigate's here.
[94:20.11]oh I gotta take off this jetpack I shot that in the wrong direction lord if we have any torpedoes can we load them it's one shot I hit it with the torpedo it up it up someone get on a gun we need to turn off some power um okay I'll give you a boost a boost we got a boost okay someone shoot this thing turn off the vacuum
[94:49.52]Life support off.
[94:50.44]Vacuum off.
[94:52.65]Where's the power cubes?
[94:54.23]I'm shooting the level two metem sentinel, right?
[94:58.23]Yep.
[94:58.35]Uh, interceptors on our left.
[95:00.42]Triple power.
[95:02.24]Is that our teammate?
[95:03.28]Yeah, we have a teammate with us.
[95:06.03]That's our ally.
[95:06.37]Below us.
[95:06.57]I'm colorblind.
[95:07.21]I didn't know that.
[95:07.77]Guys, there are ships right next to us on our left.
[95:12.25]The orange one is an ally, right?
[95:13.68]Or no?
[95:14.12]The one below us, the metem sentinel below us is green.
[95:19.05]green okay if you don't see damage numbers it's our friend okay are we gonna go fight this big ship I'm just running around in circles do you get on the minigun in the back or it's not turned on right now I'm taking care of all the little ones okay frigates
[95:42.97]we're battery our battery is way too high right now oh whoa whoa we're 11 at 8 11 8. start shutting the guns down okay okay shut down all guns shut down the gun guns is down system now running within power network tolerance uh another void jump is coming in we have about 10 seconds before another thing shows up uh I'm trying to get us to a suck on the right
[96:07.97]We suck this.
[96:09.98]Our hull is a little messed up right now.
[96:12.34]We don't have time.
[96:12.94]Something's about to show up.
[96:13.88]Suck it and then we have to get back on guns.
[96:16.54]Gun.
[96:17.18]Everybody back on guns.
[96:20.05]I think he takes way too much power.
[96:24.99]Right next to us.
[96:25.63]Heavy freighter.
[96:26.19]This thing's fucking huge.
[96:27.06]I need everyone on guns.
[96:29.28]There's a shield.
[96:31.44]We got too much power.
[96:32.72]It's calling reinforcements.
[96:38.38]Maybe replace that thing in the back with the new shield, you know what I'm saying?
[96:42.35]Oh my god, my fucking... The new shield's available.
[96:44.73]It's available.
[96:45.41]We just need to power... Oh, you mean the life support?
[96:48.41]Do we have any more torpedoes?
[96:49.85]I don't know if we need that right now.
[96:52.98]Maybe we do.
[96:53.26]Life support off.
[96:56.92]I'm buffed up shooting that tank.
[96:58.60]We are out of ammo.
[96:59.08]Gun ammo is... We're at 7 of 7 power.
[97:01.28]I can't aim at this guy.
[97:06.13]I'm hitting us, I think.
[97:06.63]It hurts in here.
[97:08.62]I'm trying to turn us more.
[97:09.68]I was hurting our own ship, I think.
[97:13.59]Oh, no.
[97:16.76]I'm going to try and go under it so they can't all shoot.
[97:18.82]Yo, they're too tanky.
[97:23.63]Shield's on.
[97:26.11]Hull integrity.
[97:29.12]Vinny, the gun has lots of ammo.
[97:30.90]We might need someone outside repairing.
[97:33.26]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[97:34.91]I'm gonna leave.
[97:36.10]We're in trouble.
[97:37.34]We're in trouble.
[97:38.84]Turn our thrusters on.
[97:39.66]I'm trying to get away so we can repair.
[97:41.00]This is fucked up, man.
[97:47.65]There's so much shit wrong with the ship.
[97:50.59]I'm going out.
[97:52.48]We're gonna die.
[97:56.00]Shit.
[97:56.68]I fucked up, guys.
[97:57.42]I thought we were out of ammo.
[97:58.39]We weren't.
[98:01.65]What's shooting us there?
[98:04.07]Open the door!
[98:04.61]Someone thrusters, someone thrusters.
[98:08.32]It's so hard to shoot, I'm like killing us.
[98:10.90]Open the fucking door!
[98:11.68]Turn all the guns off and just turn thrusters on.
[98:13.92]I think I need to kind of shoot though.
[98:20.21]We're getting away from them, it's fine.
[98:21.89]What the fuck just happened?
[98:23.84]What the hell?
[98:25.72]There's interceptors coming our way.
[98:28.12]Oh god, do I turn on the gun and shoot?
[98:31.41]Someone go downstairs and turn the thrusters on, or we will die.
[98:35.58]What's a thruster?
[98:36.34]The void jump?
[98:38.80]Why did I get teleported out of this?
[98:41.09]The void jump?
[98:42.29]It's in the void jump room, but on the right wall.
[98:45.93]Where?
[98:46.68]I'm charging them.
[98:47.26]Shit.
[98:47.50]I'm charging them.
[98:51.18]What the fuck?
[98:53.43]They're charged.
[98:56.27]Okay, someone needs to get outside and repair hull.
[99:01.11]uh I'll do my best structural Integrity compromised there's guys right on us at least I repaired one of them wasn't pressurized oh we are dead Jerma can you get on the minigun in the back yep minigun in the back
[99:30.25]Yep.
[99:31.00]Going.
[99:32.00]Is it on?
[99:32.56]Do I do the void jump if it's at 100%?
[99:34.30]No.
[99:34.48]What am I shooting at?
[99:38.68]Okay.
[99:38.80]You're moving too fast.
[99:39.65]I'm outside the ship.
[99:40.45]I can't repair.
[99:41.09]I stopped for one second.
[99:46.21]If you stay with your feet on, I think you're fine.
[99:49.82]No, Mario.
[99:50.04]I missed every job.
[99:54.28]I can't do it.
[99:54.92]That thing is fucking hard to use, man.
[99:57.47]The machine gunner?
[99:58.39]Yeah.
[99:59.35]Let me try it.
[100:01.17]we've got like three ships to destroy if anyone can get on a gun that are on us find more more repairs to make but uh we only had one I'm dead uh on the shot they shot me you have to reload press r oh get that integrity up ships biomass stores are running low that forget that's behind us is really low
[100:34.67]I think we we have a defect fire rate is less I get it I get it I get it okay I forget down I'm gonna try and get us somewhere safe and we can just repair and have a second I think we're doing alright we have we still have eight minutes before this level ends we're good if we can repair alright I'm gonna try to buy some repair kits
[100:56.86]try and save the ammo on that minigun until they get closer oh wait there's ammo oh god they are 900 meters away I'm going to put us behind this asteroid and we're going to repair someone get ready to go outside I'm ready someone stay on the minigun to protect him okay I'll keep preparing I'll repair inside
[101:24.55]okay I'm I am outside the ship I just have to look for I'll run around the circle some minor breach oh crap what the hell what is happening I don't know there's some there's still some stuff uh charged up integrity above 50 good
[101:56.29]We have one more repair.
[101:59.12]Okay, they have to move.
[102:01.08]I'm killing it.
[102:01.68]Oh, no.
[102:02.62]It's a major hull breach.
[102:03.60]I don't think I can repair it.
[102:05.49]Okay, yeah, major breach in the back.
[102:06.83]It's dead.
[102:07.87]It's dead.
[102:08.27]I killed it.
[102:08.69]It should have, like, two interceptors still on us.
[102:11.44]They're both dead.
[102:13.30]Are you inside, Vinny?
[102:14.80]No.
[102:16.39]I'm going to try to get to the major breach.
[102:18.19]I think we have a miner in the front now.
[102:21.72]okay we're safe there's a minor okay give me a second to get the okay no there's a major in the front a minor in the back minor on the back uh left I see it I see it I think I can ping jump is ready we're not jumping don't jump don't jump now don't jump now
[102:43.76]I think we still have shields on, which is probably what saved us, to be honest.
[102:47.97]Shields did a lot of work.
[102:49.29]A huge power sink.
[102:51.91]We may have enough alloy to do another repair kit.
[102:55.08]Should we do it?
[102:56.78]I think so.
[102:57.18]Yes.
[102:58.80]Alright, let's do it.
[103:01.17]We have one major hole breach in the front.
[103:04.29]Yeah, I'm going to try to repair that.
[103:05.94]We've got some more ammo for the minigun.
[103:08.50]So if you want to throw that in just to make sure we have it, that would be cool.
[103:11.59]Light crate?
[103:12.19]Um, hull repair plate.
[103:13.37]We have... We are almost out of alloys.
[103:16.49]I'm crazy.
[103:16.85]Charging the void jump also cuts engine power in half, by the way.
[103:20.08]I'm learning from chat.
[103:22.22]Ah, that's why I couldn't move.
[103:24.26]Fuck.
[103:27.07]What do we do with the... How do we use this crate?
[103:31.25]The ammo crate?
[103:33.19]Put it in the back in the minigun.
[103:34.36]In the minigun, you'll see in the top right of the minigun, there's like panels.
[103:37.48]Oh, okay.
[103:39.92]Yeah, give me that.
[103:44.53]the fact that we're now at 80 after literally getting down to I guess yeah we were we were at like five yeah someone said there's a level two shield generator on the floor somewhere uh it's right here shield mk2 oh we've got some uh are you in vinny should we use this thing we've got like another minigun and and weapon we can pick up okay I'm gonna mess around with this um
[104:16.74]what does this void jump button do that's to get out of here that's like that's like light speed signature detected that's how we get to the did you just turn it on no I pressed it like last fight earlier by accident what's the Jerm what's this this is um mk2 shield okay cool so you know what we're gonna do with this think what we do this is mk1 did you summon the minefield Ster has crazy comms so you're you're a captain mark one
[104:46.80]we're gonna get rid of this and we're gonna scrap it and we're gonna place mark two in its place cool I'll show you how to do it if you're interested um okay so stick it in there and then you grab that and yeah and then you press the top of it you gotta press the top there you go watch out watch out alright yeah I'm gonna scrap this
[105:18.91]Oh, this is double power.
[105:21.43]Yeah, that's going to be really good if we're getting shot again.
[105:25.72]Can we get another power cell?
[105:31.04]We have seven.
[105:31.62]Can I make another power cell?
[105:34.63]Or do we want to keep the alloys?
[105:38.29]I've got some.
[105:40.03]I don't know if you can deconstruct these weapons into alloys.
[105:43.90]or what ships come with built-in life support extra life support is for extra dangerous situations for the small ship it's the left of the door oh okay so I'm going to keep the life support we have three minutes yeah I think we have we have two we think we need three you can get mods yeah this one charging yes we only have two mods can make the guns better and you can actually mod something to use one less power oh that's actually oh that's broken that's probably the best one honestly that's that sounds good yeah this thing uses three
[106:13.30]This, uh, Confessor Carinade, this thing uses three power.
[106:16.72]This thing is beefy.
[106:19.17]Which one is this now?
[106:21.95]Oh, over here.
[106:22.53]I gotcha.
[106:22.81]This game owns.
[106:23.77]What?
[106:25.11]Yeah, I forgot why I enjoyed it so much, but I really like this.
[106:30.08]Dude, the minigun went crazy for me.
[106:34.41]I'm not sure I'd forget left.
[106:36.53]I feel like I still would like it.
[106:39.22]I'm enjoying driving check if you can make a range mod for the minigun that's not a bad idea I do feel like this is the kind of game though where if you say something that you need there's like so much chaos and it's hard to gauge what's going on uh yeah I think we completely failed the frigate I think it left so there's one other abandoned facility we can go loot and then I think we have to leave in two minutes so
[107:05.85]so Jerma um quick question have you been charging the power cells can someone charge the thrusters yeah you throw them away up here okay and then you flip these if they get um overdrawn right I understand okay I wasn't sure I had to do that myself does the gun use power cell I don't think this one does this gun doesn't appear to have a power no
[107:31.66]so that would be a mod like see that mod slot we could we could get that that costs 10 scrap he was testing you um also we have we already have a confessor carronade so I'm gonna scrap this any objections all hands on deck in the middle of ship right now for captain's meeting all hands on deck yes sir you come you come down here everybody come down here follow Ster
[108:01.18]These things right here are the thruster boosters.
[108:03.79]Yeah, they've been on 99% uptime.
[108:09.61]Sure.
[108:10.71]They have been.
[108:12.88]Ow!
[108:18.93]Yeah, I don't know how to do the engine stuff.
[108:20.81]Hey, I wanna go over to your captain's chair and fuck around with your desk and talk about what you got going on up there.
[108:25.08]Well, in the middle of a fight where we're 4% health and I can get us away, but the ship doesn't have charge... I'm gonna scrap this.
[108:31.13]Hold on.
[108:31.33]Yo, should we, uh, break down?
[108:34.36]Vinny, we have one minute.
[108:35.38]I just got to an abandoned facility.
[108:36.96]If we wanna, like, grab loot and leave, that's the objective right now.
[108:39.94]And we can talk about it when we're wrapping.
[108:41.61]We have one minute.
[108:43.35]We have one minute.
[108:44.01]Okay.
[108:46.59]We should be good.
[108:49.66]figured out the strat well like a bum cushion oh okay I'm gonna sit in a bum cushion yeah we took it one ammo and then I'll break it down right right recycle and then I can craft it also yeah nobody charged the void unless we're leaving because I think right now even while it's charged we're slower
[109:11.46]This is like a maze in here, sir.
[109:13.05]I'm going to have some problems.
[109:15.53]Yeah, no problem.
[109:15.93]Do you get a Neelix impression?
[109:16.93]Do you think anybody in this call knows what that is?
[109:19.27]I don't see shit.
[109:19.98]I think so.
[109:20.52]We only have seven seconds.
[109:21.78]Will they know by hearing it?
[109:23.56]I don't know where they're coming from.
[109:25.32]And I'm not sure that we can leave until... Okay, time's up.
[109:30.43]Captain.
[109:30.77]Were we in here already?
[109:31.71]I think we were.
[109:32.87]We weren't.
[109:34.07]No.
[109:34.52]If you please, Captain.
[109:35.32]Did you see something?
[109:37.66]I don't see anything.
[109:40.03]I just made the most scrumptious cake.
[109:42.76]Captain, would you like a taste of my delicious food?
[109:46.08]So are we going to die?
[109:47.80]I don't know.
[109:48.90]The Jerm is trying to give me cake.
[109:50.32]I'm stressed out.
[109:52.17]I studied for six years to become the captain of this fucking ship.
[109:56.35]People don't know where the thrusters are.
[109:59.17]I found the item.
[110:00.82]It's ammo.
[110:01.84]I'm getting out of here.
[110:03.12]Two seconds.
[110:03.68]Two seconds, Captain.
[110:04.48]He's crashing out, guys.
[110:05.76]He's crashing out.
[110:08.80]And I am out and ready to... exfiltrate.
[110:18.67]Okay, our void is charged.
[110:20.78]What happened?
[110:22.96]Ship losing oxygen?
[110:24.40]I didn't close the door yet.
[110:25.38]Holy shit.
[110:27.08]Did someone die?
[110:28.34]Almost.
[110:29.34]Almost.
[110:31.93]Oh shit!
[110:32.35]Oh shit!
[110:34.77]Is that you in the thrusters?
[110:37.21]yeah I'm dying I'll close it close the the the door where'd the um did the did we get the ammo get in get in get in hollow reclaimer

[111:04.20]As fast as I can go!
[111:05.52]I'm fucked up!
[111:06.26]I don't have a parachute!
[111:08.20]Alright, close it, please!
[111:10.53]Open the door!
[111:11.85]I need air!
[111:12.83]I need heat!
[111:13.65]I need air or something!
[111:14.47]Open the door!
[111:16.40]Why are we dying?
[111:18.30]I need air!
[111:18.96]Do I put this thing on cold?
[111:21.67]No!
[111:25.70]Things unavailable?
[111:26.82]I don't... What's happening?
[111:28.91]Put on heat!
[111:30.07]We need heat.
[111:33.27]Oh my god, why is it so cold in here?
[111:34.97]Life support is off.
[111:35.95]We need life support.
[111:36.73]Go get life support on.
[111:37.91]It's at the back of the ship.
[111:39.78]Or on the basement bottom of the ship.
[111:42.02]Please.
[111:42.82]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[111:43.74]It's on, it's on, it's on!
[111:46.02]Guys, I don't know why I don't have a void exit... ...ability.
[111:52.27]Like, there's nowhere to leave.
[111:56.08]Dude, we're freezing our asses off.
[112:00.17]Wait, I fixed it.
[112:01.65]Oh, we're good.
[112:02.19]What's happening?
[112:03.81]You've entered the ship's atmosphere by opening the airlock.
[112:06.82]It didn't actually give me a place to go, so I wasn't sure.
[112:10.06]Yo.
[112:11.04]They rapidly decompressed the entire ship.
[112:14.93]Alright.
[112:15.47]Everyone sit down.
[112:16.11]Everyone sit down now.
[112:16.83]Sit down.
[112:17.25]Sit down.
[112:17.65]Sit down.
[112:18.13]No.
[112:18.85]I'm dead.
[112:19.26]I'm in the... I'm dead.
[112:20.88]I'm dead.
[112:22.18]I was in the airlock, dude, still.
[112:23.89]How did this go so wrong?
[112:25.17]We were in the airlock for like 40 minutes.
[112:27.17]I thought we were done playing around with the airlock.
[112:30.82]How did this go so wrong so quick?
[112:33.50]That was awful.
[112:37.52]Oh, I'm healing.
[112:38.55]Alright, I'm sitting.
[112:42.63]Okay, so I think I messed up on the airlock, right?
[112:46.30]Or something.
[112:46.82]I don't know.
[112:47.34]Press the airlock.
[112:48.91]was me I can't I can't leave the cloning bay you suck we have no biomass can someone buy biomass so my body cannot reconstitute itself because it's I I uh because we don't have enough flesh I mean I could make some right now that was real for a second uh how do I get the biomass I think I'm okay now my health is very low but I think I'm okay
[113:19.85]That was a fucking like movie level disaster.
[113:23.15]That was so bad.
[113:24.03]Oh, that gets me every time.
[113:28.58]It's never going to not work.
[113:38.43]All that for a little bit of ammo.
[113:41.88]Yeah, well, we fucked up the destroying the freighter as well.
[113:47.35]So what happens if we fail the mission?
[113:48.55]If we just go again?
[113:51.20]Yeah, you start from the beginning again, but we failed that mission so we didn't get a reward as well.
[113:57.65]The other thing I've noticed here is that the life support was on heat and not oxygen.
[114:11.55]Wait, I put it on heat because I was freezing.
[114:13.63]Oh, okay.
[114:14.53]Yeah, we had to.
[114:15.51]Yeah, we were freezing to death.
[114:18.01]Yeah, and then I put the enhancement, and I saved my health at 1%.
[114:21.94]And then a Ster killed me.
[114:25.08]Oh, I see.
[114:26.28]You deserved it.
[114:28.36]Alright.
[114:29.64]Wow.
[114:34.25]Dude.
[114:35.19]We're still here.
[114:36.21]We need biomass somewhere.
[114:41.28]What do you guys do with these...
[114:43.99]Guns we don't need.
[114:47.13]Why do you recycle things?
[114:49.27]So that minigun, I was wondering, maybe we would maybe need it at some point.
[114:54.54]Okay.
[114:56.22]Because, for example, this payload launcher, we no longer have any missiles, so watch this.
[115:01.17]I think we bin this for a bit and put a minigun here, and we can toggle between the two when we need them.
[115:07.67]This next mission is a wave survival, so we are going to need guns.
[115:20.11]Alright.
[115:24.40]Have you guys played the Oblivion remaster yet?
[115:27.82]Yeah.
[115:28.59]Is it good?
[115:29.13]I got like 12 hours in it.
[115:31.61]I think 12, 13.
[115:33.31]I'm enjoying the hell out of it.
[115:34.61]It's great.
[115:35.87]I think I'm going to be playing that later tonight.
[115:39.44]Big dub.
[115:40.24]You're going to enjoy it.
[115:41.80]It's like Skyrim, but with demons.
[115:46.51]That's honestly true.
[115:48.91]Check upgrades.
[115:50.64]Wait, where?
[115:51.84]Here?
[115:55.09]Oh.
[115:57.41]If you recycle the purple ammo crate recipe to make more, you will be the highest level.
[116:04.04]What if I got the fire rate for the minigun?
[116:08.10]Oh, that'd be pretty sick.
[116:10.89]Or damage.
[116:14.59]Yeah, or is there range?
[116:16.97]Who just bought something?
[116:19.55]No, I deconstructed something.
[116:27.40]Nice.
[116:28.74]The reason I did that is because when you deconstruct... Orange.
[116:33.33]Anything.
[116:37.86]When you deconstruct good stuff, you get the recipe.
[116:44.19]There we go.
[116:45.21]Now we get a lot of ammo.
[116:46.37]That's good shit.
[116:47.35]What's the best artificial flavor?
[116:49.57]We'll go around the room.
[116:54.84]Give me an example.
[116:56.10]Like grape, cherry, vanilla.
[117:01.62]Artificial watermelon is barely watermelon.
[117:05.49]Yeah.
[117:06.33]Like banana.
[117:08.47]Pink starburst.
[117:11.70]Like the pink or red starburst.
[117:13.16]Red's okay.
[117:15.30]Red actually is pretty great, yeah.
[117:17.51]Red and pink are the best.
[117:19.21]And blue is really good, too.
[117:20.73]But I do not fuck with the orange or yellow ones.
[117:24.64]Really?
[117:25.04]But we have an engineer, right?
[117:26.56]Yeah, and the candies, like, it's the orange ones or yellows are just, like, they're really annoying to me.
[117:32.21]What do you want from me?
[117:34.37]This whole room was on fire, and you had to, like, reset all of these valves.
[117:38.23]I was talking.
[117:38.97]The thing about the yellow, though, is if it's banana, it's god tier.
[117:44.85]know what I'm saying but usually yellow represents like lemony yeah that's true yeah yeah I'm with that with that yeah uh artificial banana it's good it's good I like artificial banana yeah me too because like that medicine we had when we were kids I think like blue raspberry raspberry is so weird it's so tangy it's great yeah
[118:12.68]Alright, I'm ready to go to the next mission.
[118:15.48]Aye aye, sir.
[118:16.54]Is that what you want?
[118:18.41]What do you want from me?
[118:20.21]I want Poke to sit down so he doesn't die.
[118:21.77]Oh, okay.
[118:22.73]Sorry.
[118:24.42]I'm just... I don't know, dude.
[118:25.46]I'm... I'm here.
[118:32.15]I do like when you call me captain, though.
[118:34.01]That's nice.
[118:37.08]This jump is for the boys back home, Hoster.
[118:41.92]yeah we have a minor hole breach on the front I'm gonna take care of that and please no one open the uh airlock uh you want me to not uh reset the void charge you said don't do that don't touch the void until we need to leave yeah because it slows us down by 50 apparently yeah that whole mission we were at like slug pace wait what's the void
[119:11.12]void is how we leave our void engine lets us do the warp at the end alright so what are we what are we up to uh we are repairing the whole vinny just repaired we're back in oops I forgot that okay we were approaching uh I did the wrong order we need to go into a facility and when we do we're gonna have to do like a wave defense
[119:40.01]I'd love to go on a facility and start messing around.
[119:43.83]There's some fighters flying around and I want to destroy them before we get started.
[119:49.32]Sir, what kind of candy do you like?
[119:51.16]What kind of can?
[119:53.36]Like what kind of colored candy?
[119:56.49]Uh, it has to be colored.
[119:58.37]Like if there's like a candy... A peanut M&M?
[120:02.17]What color candy would you choose?
[120:07.28]Um...
[120:09.50]brown because it's chocolate you wonder the best candy the best candy ever and they don't make it anymore and it's annoying you guys ever had an original Mars bar the original recipe Mars bar no no
[120:24.34]It's a chocolate bar.
[120:26.40]It's filled with white nougat.
[120:28.46]And it's got almonds in it.
[120:30.05]The original Mars bar.
[120:31.49]Not the one with the black label.
[120:32.79]Not the black label with the red letters.
[120:34.13]I'm talking the original Mars bar.
[120:35.31]I'm like the bad guy here.
[120:36.35]Can we get someone on the guns?
[120:37.84]I'm on a gun right now.
[120:38.64]I'm ready to shoot.
[120:39.60]There's two people on guns right now.
[120:42.62]Do I shoot this guy?
[120:43.64]Satellite dish?
[120:45.39]No, right side of the ship.
[120:46.39]They're about a thousand meters away.
[120:47.47]I'm trying to get us close.
[120:49.25]Ready?
[120:52.40]Firing!
[120:53.50]I'm in the back, so I can't do anything.
[120:56.26]There's two power.
[120:57.44]That's two.
[120:59.79]That's one.
[121:00.31]I really want to put on shields, but they're gonna... Where are they shooting us from?
[121:06.04]We'll be fine.
[121:06.62]Don't worry about it.
[121:07.36]Just destroy.
[121:09.44]Okay.
[121:09.56]Hollow Reclaimer alerted?
[121:12.95]Oh, I see.
[121:13.89]We have 15 minutes.
[121:15.29]Fuck it.
[121:15.65]I guess I'm shooting, too.
[121:21.21]If you press tab when you're on a gun, you get the bottom guns just in case.
[121:25.37]That's very useful.
[121:30.92]Okay, one guy.
[121:31.48]I feel like this minigun is wasting ammo.
[121:34.98]Hey, boys, clean.
[121:36.46]Boys, clean.
[121:38.42]Boys, we're getting inside this progenitor facility, and then we have to defend it.
[121:44.47]So at that point, we could probably turn the energy shields on.
[121:49.86]let me know when you want me to put this on to the facility and power on the power plant you'll need power fuses to restart the power generator what she said we need to get outside and power this thing on I thought that was an alert I thought the ship was saying that
[122:20.17]V what am I saying men will prevail oh those things men men and preserve you prevail airlock open somebody shoot a gun you want you want me out there or yeah I want I want as many people out as we can get alright everybody get your oxygen
[122:49.31]he prescribes the tank sir you gotta be a mean captain like what are you doing I I I feel like I'm the only one enjoying the game I'm loving this I like this a lot I hate this game I landed us up here instead we all need to get out and you guys I don't know I like I don't want to interrupt we we didn't understand why the guy was saying men preserve you yeah my guys started going crazy we were just confused more than anything our faction is menem
[123:13.00]we're the men we need to get the power cores and power this up where's the power coupling over there uh yeah power fuse is down at the bottom I can I'm gonna go I didn't preserve you let me go like men it's looking for treats
[123:42.62]Just looking for treats.
[123:44.40]I'm just going to drive away.
[123:45.92]I got the power thing.
[123:47.81]Airlock, open.
[123:56.50]We get everything?
[123:57.74]This area is like really dark.
[123:59.04]I don't know that.
[123:59.68]Oh, shit.
[124:00.18]Okay.
[124:01.26]Press T. Power on.
[124:02.48]Now, we got power.
[124:04.67]Power plant online.
[124:06.31]Now, activate the comm relay to download the data from the progenitor data store.
[124:11.31]big button yeah like I I I don't know we have pipes broken in like the main room this whole I don't know ads are going to start in about a minute uh I can't really take a break everyone's just like this is very much uh you got to be on and be here but they're going to start about one minute just want to man preserve you success the relay is attempting to establish a long-range connection okay everybody get back on this massive spike in radio emissions is sure to attract attention prepare for incoming hostiles
[124:40.96]Oh, I really should take a break soon.
[124:43.86]Grown ass men preserve you.
[124:46.78]Open, open it.
[124:47.56]Please open.
[124:48.21]Oh, no, we have to repair those.
[124:53.13]Sorry.
[124:53.55]Uneven pressure.
[124:55.34]Uneven pressure.
[124:57.08]I'm not touching that.
[124:57.68]Wait, did I need to get an item?
[125:03.39]We can increase the download speed if we repair this stuff.
[125:05.81]Yeah, you guys, you got to repair outside the facility to speed up.
[125:09.04]Maybe we should do that.
[125:10.18]Yeah.
[125:16.14]is anything one or two more wait I think I am dying are you out of oxygen yeah ads are starting right now did you did you die you're alright uh there's fighters coming in on us right now we do need one person on guns well thank god I'm here poke is here okay kill everyone with the airlock I'm almost out of oxygen there are 600 meters they're about to start shooting missiles at us
[125:44.86]Alright, let's get this open.
[125:46.70]That was my... I need to get this thing off me.
[125:50.23]Wait, wait, wait.
[125:50.67]Don't do it yet.
[125:51.27]Don't do it yet.
[125:52.35]I'm not touching it.
[125:52.91]I'm not touching it.
[125:56.01]Okay, we're good.
[125:58.90]Now you can take the thing off.
[126:05.33]Should we turn the shield on?
[126:06.75]I think now we just are doing defense until this downloads everything.
[126:09.87]We can turn the shield on, Captain, but here's the problem.
[126:13.38]It's directional.
[126:15.42]okay uh we're eight out of seven on energy yeah yeah so I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and turn off minigun for now I'm going the other gun because I don't like them it's good for boss I've increased the power so for two minutes we have powers oh we have a sniper in the distance sniper
[126:43.74]I'm going to go focus him.
[126:48.10]Minigun will be really good for these hollow fighters.
[126:50.41]That was no ammo.
[126:52.77]Is there not?
[126:53.51]Oh, it's unpowered.
[126:55.77]Oh, shit.
[126:55.97]Oh, look.
[126:59.86]Sorry.
[127:03.94]Oh, up in smoke.
[127:05.80]See you later.
[127:11.72]You gotta flip at least one lever or the shields don't do anything.
[127:15.38]Oh, oops.
[127:15.92]Fuck.
[127:16.36]You're right.
[127:27.04]We have shields everywhere now.
[127:28.22]I don't know if that diminishes the effect.
[127:32.09]You can put them just on the front.
[127:34.83]Where do you need them right now?
[127:36.17]Nowhere right now.
[127:40.67]Where- are we go- are we okay?
[127:42.70]Yeah, we're just- we're in combat.
[127:44.30]Uh, shields are gonna be needed.
[127:45.40]I think we're gonna be able to handle this fine.
[127:46.98]I'm gonna swap these two power cores.
[127:52.91]I have another sniper.
[127:53.61]Sniper!
[127:55.55]I can dodge it.
[127:56.35]Where the fuck did it just go?
[127:58.60]Just focus on the little guys.
[127:59.76]I'm gonna dodge the sniper.
[128:06.35]There, everything seems to be in order.
[128:07.39]Whoa!
[128:07.55]That explosion was huge.
[128:14.71]Wait, how did I mess up the reload minigame?
[128:21.62]Yeah, what are those explosions?
[128:22.78]Am I wasting ammo on that?
[128:25.66]We alright?
[128:26.76]The range is kind of low on the minigun.
[128:29.93]Yeah, just try and make sure you wait until they're close.
[128:33.45]Circuit breakers under strain.
[128:34.41]We're at 8 out of 7.
[128:34.99]We need to turn something off.
[128:38.34]Turn off shields.
[128:44.38]Are we going to focus this bomber drama?
[128:46.18]You want to hop on a gun?
[128:47.64]Yeah, I'll go in the back.
[128:49.38]Oh no, I'll go in the side as well.
[128:51.47]Side minigun you can use.
[128:54.01]We have enough power for that.
[128:56.81]There you go.
[128:58.46]Satellite dish we're defending is at half health.
[129:03.78]It was too far away sniper.
[129:07.87]And I'm taking us back.
[129:15.38]I'm gonna put us like right over the satellite dish so we can defend it nice some items in space too we gotta figure out I'm trying to I'm getting these later I'm I'm grabbing them now
[129:37.89]okay it's gonna overload the power but I think we can afford that for a couple minutes or a couple seconds oh that fire I'm not so sure that we can okay I'm gonna move wow what's going on up there what's the temperature in here okay no that's fine me if these bombers need to die oh you can shoot their missiles what do we got here shuriken energy gatling
[130:07.40]Mark one.
[130:07.94]Gatling gun?
[130:09.43]Got a gatling.
[130:10.01]New gatling.
[130:10.65]Just dropped.
[130:12.05]Some alloy.
[130:17.54]Six alloy coming in.
[130:19.60]They're dead.
[130:21.27]Nice work.
[130:21.51]They're dead.
[130:22.53]There's some more alloy over there.
[130:29.46]Nice dodge.
[130:31.04]okay prepare void drive someone prepare void drive I got it got it but there are still so many items there's so much loot we we still have time to grab them but we completed the mission we have five minutes until the mission's over so we have time to collect all this I'm gonna fly us towards the sniper um if you if we turn on the vacuum
[130:55.01]I'm going to increase the power of it so we can get stuff more effectively.
[130:59.49]We still got some fighters to clean up.
[131:03.58]Okay.
[131:06.52]You're charged up, sir.
[131:15.28]A thank you would suffice, you know.
[131:17.06]Thank you, sir.
[131:18.00]Yeah.

[131:23.49]Focus him.
[131:26.98]Okay, reinforcements are about to come in right next to us.
[131:36.14]Let's try and burn through those and then go get loot.
[131:38.68]I'm already low on minigun ammo.
[131:42.19]I think we got some alloy.
[131:44.09]We can make even better bullets now.

[132:44.29]uh power I'm working on it I'm dragging in an alloy right now if we need it more for something we're fine we've got about 30 seconds before the power restabilizes okay I'm sucking in one more thing how you doing on ammo good I went oh they're gonna to kill the
[133:13.28]I'm gonna fly us to the sniper after we suck this in and we're gonna take a nice sniper hit oh no we're not good job okay I'm going after uh yeah let's go kill sniper and like just grab it and fight so many clusters of of uh stuff yeah we've got two minutes just about hours getting low here bomber below us

[135:17.95]I think I've got mostly everything there's like one more thing I'm gonna grab and then we're gonna avoid shift we're gonna get the out of here guys we're gonna live there's a double buster booster station yeah this is a double do I even waste ammo doing a good job I just want to say should I even shoot these guys or just leave right uh don't waste ammo yeah can we get a better benediction cannon
[135:44.60]I feel like that gun is really good.
[135:45.74]We can.
[135:46.90]Once we get out of here, we can do that.
[135:48.87]We have the materials now.
[135:52.29]This thing is okay.
[135:53.94]This thing is not getting grabbed.
[135:56.24]I'm increasing the... I'm enhancing it.
[135:57.98]I'm enhancing.
[136:02.39]Okay.

[136:57.46]Yes, we are at the hollow boss, the flame matron.
[137:03.46]Poke, what did you want?
[137:04.15]Benediction?
[137:05.99]I think Benediction three would go crazy.
[137:07.55]The best one.
[137:09.45]because it doesn't use ammo it just taps those fighter fire guys fighters whatever alright these guys back up uh how do I huh how do I add two since we get a mark two chat fix your health bin
[137:35.59]I'll go in the rest pod.
[137:37.69]The hull's kind of messed up.
[137:38.61]We have to upgrade the fabricator.
[137:44.72]Wait, get new talents?
[137:45.48]Where can I check talents?
[137:49.64]Yeah, where do you check talents?
[137:57.91]We should have multiple upgrades, right?
[137:59.77]Oh, top right of fabricator right here.
[138:03.75]you see that oh shit I see one yeah how do you heal anyway does any chat members know I'll show you right here Vinny upstairs go to right here the sarco graph the sucko graph enter it you haven't done this upgrading the fabricator or does that not matter um oh yeah we want to upgrade the fabricator so we get mark two items okay needs five alloy
[138:33.57]Do we have that?
[138:36.09]Can we just break shit down?
[138:38.29]I look fucking sick.
[138:38.98]We can break a couple things down that we don't need.
[138:43.30]Take a look at me.
[138:45.36]I'm like the NPC that we saw.
[138:48.07]I look pretty cool, don't I?
[138:50.47]Over here.
[138:52.83]You can mess around with your character sheet.
[138:56.84]Oh.
[138:59.62]Oh, I got some new rewards.
[139:02.15]Hell yeah, opening loot crates mid-game.
[139:04.07]I thought we had to die for this.
[139:06.33]Same, same here.
[139:08.59]Now this is the motivation to live I needed.
[139:12.08]Same here.
[139:14.20]I was ready to give up.
[139:16.12]Not me.
[139:19.93]Hell yeah.
[139:21.05]It's going to take a quick nap.
[139:23.07]Yeah.
[139:24.77]Man, this game is just cool.
[139:27.40]Mm-hmm.
[139:29.92]Mm-hmm.
[139:31.43]Mm-hmm.
[139:32.23]Gene tree is your skill points.
[139:34.21]Who's gene?
[139:35.47]Oh, there's a defect here.
[139:37.96]Accuracy, range, or fire rate.
[139:39.88]I feel like range is really good.
[139:42.38]Range, I think, is probably the best because it feels like you can just pick them off before they even get over to us.
[139:48.75]Yeah.
[139:49.29]Oh, yeah.
[139:51.77]I don't have any upgrades yet.
[139:54.21]So, okay, we definitely... I'm going to attempt to get us some stuff here.
[140:00.44]Yeah, can we get another power cell?
[140:02.60]I would love another power cell.
[140:05.77]We have so many alloys.
[140:06.73]Oh, my God.
[140:07.55]We have one major hole breach.
[140:10.44]We have two miners, one major, if that's a repair thing we can get.
[140:18.23]Can auto-recycle ally clusters.
[140:20.21]Alright, so
[140:20.74]Somebody said, are we going to get Squeaks Sunday?
[140:23.87]That is the plan, yeah.
[140:26.55]Saturday we're going to do Ichio Scary Night, Bush Light.
[140:31.26]And then maybe Monday for Squeaks.
[140:36.79]Maybe it'll be Squeaks Monday, maybe.
[140:38.23]Either Sunday or Monday.
[140:41.44]We're going to play a bunch of Switch games.
[140:44.66]That is the plan.
[140:46.71]and then I do want to play oblivion too so I I want to play oblivion probably tonight whenever we're done with this maybe a few hours just get it rolling because I I've been looking at it on my steam dashboard for like a week and obviously I wasn't around for the last week or two but uh I do want to play it so it looks like it yeah look down and do the V down wait which one is it hold V and all the way down the other end

[141:43.37]Alright, so it's three, two, one, bang.
[141:46.61]Yeah, the goat's in our head.
[141:47.78]Alright, you ready?

[142:37.83]I would love another battery.
[142:39.94]We are out of ammo.
[142:45.98]Because that could go... Does it look like I'm laughing, sir?

[147:35.66]Yeah.
[147:35.82]Yeah.
[147:38.46]la la bomba la la bomba old so I'm just a minigun guy that's a good stone you can be whatever guy you want but I like you though
[147:54.02]Um, I understand.
[147:55.10]So the batteries charge the energy stuff.
[147:57.08]I get it.
[147:58.05]So, so Jerm Jerm, these aren't actually increasing the power.
[148:00.97]They're just making things better.
[148:02.59]So for example, this battery in here, not better.
[148:06.78]It's like it's powering them.
[148:07.92]So, um, we're not using this gun.
[148:11.24]So I think we're going to turn that off.
[148:14.23]I know this is, yeah, this is a good config.
[148:16.33]Okay.
[148:16.77]Sorry.
[148:17.69]I don't have to say anything.
[148:19.15]Wait, why is the health of our ship so low?
[148:20.74]We can't fix it right now.
[148:22.34]No, we need to get out of the jump.
[148:24.90]Ah.
[148:25.88]Yeah.
[148:26.60]We have major hole breaches.
[148:28.70]Don't.
[148:29.00]We'll die.
[148:33.03]Alright.
[148:33.33]Let's do it.
[148:34.07]Let's jump.
[148:34.77]Everybody sit down.
[148:36.31]Everybody be ready to go repair the hole.
[148:39.12]Do we have a way?
[148:39.74]Improves recharge.
[148:40.90]That's good.
[148:41.72]Do we have a way to repair a major breach?
[148:46.75]I'm here with Dr. Jimmy Brunk.
[148:48.53]Not yet, but we can afford it.
[148:53.71]oh there's two minor breaches first thing we're doing is repairing if we can repair the major that's good so we gotta kick this boss's ass right just unload it's not too far away from us yeah we need to uh repair we shall find a path to victory going out we have a kit
[149:22.29]I'm here.
[149:25.78]Maybe put the shield on the back so the right side can be shielded.
[149:29.62]Well, no, it's fine.
[149:30.63]Shield is good.
[149:33.41]Can you put the shield only on one side of the ship?
[149:35.79]You can.
[149:37.42]I would do that.
[149:39.42]Alright.
[149:39.64]We have major breaches, Star?
[149:41.92]One major breach in the back, top of the ship.
[149:44.57]I'm backing right now.
[149:46.09]Yeah, do we?
[149:47.47]Yeah, we need a major hull repair plate.

[150:33.70]Yeah, it was like he tried to tell Jeff Bezos and like have a human moment with him.
[150:37.90]Oh yeah, I saw that.
[150:38.61]Then he just turned around and started... And then Bezos just like fucking like, what did he do?
[150:41.77]Champagne?
[150:43.27]Yeah, no, fuck, I saw that.
[150:45.26]But he was like, he was like, I saw only the black void of death when I was in space.
[150:50.18]And Bezos was like, champagne, motherfucker!
[150:52.77]Wait, Shatner was on that ship?
[150:55.19]he's on a different one last year two years ago I think two or three wait with katie perry he's just sitting there like thinking about death and they're all like singing yeah yeah that's up death uh when we're ready to battle stations let me know if you need any charges and oh something's a little steamy in here hold on they're all just up there f-12ing
[151:21.09]Right.
[151:23.26]Singing Katy Perry's new song.
[151:26.50]Okay, I am ready to do the void reset jump whenever you want me to.
[151:32.81]Don't do that.
[151:35.11]I just said I was going to do it when you were ready.
[151:38.16]Are our boosts full?
[151:39.72]Our boosts
[151:41.60]are good are you talking about the thrusters boosters everybody on guns everybody on guns left side of the ship hold on the problem is okay so the shields are currently only in the front yeah I put them that way but it also means no they're only on the side that's where I want them that's incorrect they're right now there's too much power no I'm looking at the ship and I am the minigun oh I see let me see I gotcha we should move the minigun stuff I think it's too bad
[152:12.44]You move all the guns to the left side of the ship because I'm just going to fly in circles around this.
[152:17.61]You want to do that?
[152:18.21]Yeah, I'm moving the minigun.
[152:21.31]Alright, I'm moving the shield generator too then.
[152:25.56]Where, to the back?
[152:26.28]So what about the Benediction Cannon MK1?
[152:31.49]I'll show you.
[152:32.81]So we'll keep that there.
[152:34.45]That's the side, right?
[152:36.59]Yeah, okay, so keep that there.
[152:40.12]It's going to be a little messy, but we'll get it.
[152:46.77]I have an idea when's the reclaimer coming it's not gonna come out where it's it's waiting for us patiently oh so so I'm gonna put this is the planet the enemy yes we're gonna fight a planet bro are we putting the energy generator in the back the shield wait that's it yeah we need to put the shield back there where is that did we
[153:16.97]This is the shield.
[153:18.09]I'm going to put the shield back there.
[153:19.56]We're going to put all the guns to one side and we're all going to hop on them.
[153:23.10]The problem is though we're going to run out of power pretty quick.
[153:29.02]Let's put the medium power cell.
[153:32.37]We need to charge this thing a little bit.
[153:35.45]I'm going to put this one here.
[153:41.67]We're going to put the confessor coronet here.
[153:44.56]Any weapon preference for anybody?
[153:46.16]I don't really have one.
[153:48.58]Anything's fine.
[153:50.06]Is this enough ammo in here?
[153:51.00]Should we get another ammo crate?
[153:54.17]For the minigun?
[153:55.13]Yeah.
[153:55.61]For the minigun, we got one right there.
[153:58.15]We can just wait till I get to zero and then craft one.
[154:00.22]Okay.
[154:00.34]We got one right here too.
[154:01.20]We got plenty.
[154:01.84]Oh.
[154:02.50]Oh, nice.
[154:03.70]Okay.
[154:03.82]This one uses energy.
[154:05.24]So we got to keep this thing.
[154:06.79]If this is any good, we're going to keep this, um, charged.
[154:11.69]The shields are going to be charged.
[154:16.26]We got that.
[154:17.50]Um.
[154:18.42]How's the power looking?
[154:19.72]Is it on the side you want?
[154:20.68]The side of the guns?
[154:21.38]Yep.
[154:21.64]Yep.
[154:22.04]Alright, great.
[154:24.58]Alright, are we going in?
[154:26.87]Are we turning these on?
[154:27.69]Are we ready to unload?
[154:29.57]We're going to drain the power, but are we ready to go?
[154:32.26]I'm ready to unload if you guys are ready to drain.
[154:36.00]No, wait.
[154:38.86]Okay.
[154:39.57]I'll recycle these two large crates and then get a full one.
[154:46.46]you mean just recycle the animus crates no these right here the uh the anim the ammo because it's 200 and this one's 200. oh and they recycle for one yeah but I mean I could I could empty it out and then do it you know I free bullets I mean it's a boss I'm gonna do it now wait I think hang on a second I think we can do this for free basically uh not free but for one it'll be worth it yeah that's what I'm saying right here
[155:17.24]Oh shit, we're out of... No.
[155:18.62]Fuck.
[155:19.33]Never mind.
[155:20.31]It's not free.
[155:21.03]It's two for one, but we just lose like... Yeah, we just have to do that game, that light gun game at every arcade where you aim at the same spot and it does double shooting power.
[155:32.36]Alright, we're good.
[155:32.80]We're two full ammo now.
[155:33.70]See that?
[155:34.69]Yep.
[155:35.17]Nice, nice.
[155:36.63]Alright, we're ready to kill this boss, guys.
[155:38.31]We're ready, and once we get there, we're going to hit the boost on the shield and get a two minute.
[155:42.56]I think...
[155:45.36]yeah alright we're ready are we ready to do this okay I'm going in alright we're powering on I thought we were ready go and it didn't you let me we start firing now hold on we're 1.5 kilometers away we're gonna have to be at least under one thousand fight fight fight wait are we in range
[156:14.38]Do we just die?
[156:18.17]Can we shoot it?
[156:18.87]I think you shoot those blue symbols on it.
[156:23.35]We're over electricity.
[156:24.41]Is that bad?
[156:25.57]Yes, that's very bad.
[156:26.62]We are, but I got this.
[156:27.34]I got this.
[156:28.82]No, I don't.
[156:29.70]Oh, can we kill it?
[156:31.66]It overloaded our thing.
[156:33.71]You see those things pop out?
[156:35.37]Okay.
[156:35.77]Yeah, that's a lot of damage.
[156:38.79]We did alright.
[156:45.19]I don't think those are okay.
[156:46.46]It's taking some damage from those.
[156:49.96]Here comes.
[156:55.74]Good.
[156:58.43]Yeah, I'm owning.
[156:58.87]I'm about to ulti for this one.
[157:01.25]Is it going to have a shield up right now?
[157:02.45]It's invincible.
[157:03.15]Yeah, what's going on?
[157:05.15]I don't know.
[157:05.77]It's recharging.
[157:06.83]I'm going to go mess around.
[157:07.92]I'm going to go repair some shit.
[157:13.08]Oh, fuck.
[157:18.47]okay it's summoning these turrets on the outside too I said a lot of damage we're gonna need to destroy one of these turrets I think we're getting blasted but focus on the boss whenever it shoots and the ammo is out ouch
[157:43.53]I need someone to reset the thrusters so I can dodge.
[157:47.14]I did, I did.
[157:49.76]Okay.
[157:49.88]Okay, while it's immune, we're going to focus on the turret.
[157:57.67]That's not good.
[157:58.01]Okay, okay, okay.
[157:58.37]Turned my gun off.
[158:04.19]Turret down.
[158:07.70]Okay, let's just do a loop and destroy some turrets.
[158:10.73]It's the worst killing turret.
[158:11.71]It's already half dead.
[158:20.13]I'm getting out.
[158:21.27]12 out of 8 power.
[158:23.17]Let me stay on minigun.
[158:28.20]Someone turn off something else.
[158:30.12]No, you can stay.
[158:30.80]It's fine.
[158:31.22]We're taxing the system, but it's alright.
[158:33.92]I'm running around flipping switches.
[158:38.34]The ship's power system is under strain, and one of the circuit breakers is unconscious.
[158:42.77]I got it.
[158:43.57]Alright, circuit breakers has been tripped, so I'll turn off my gun again.
[158:46.35]20 seconds for a boost.
[158:50.52]Yeah, just get closer.
[158:52.24]I think it's there a little bit.
[158:53.90]I think if I stay on the outside, our shields are facing all of the turrets, and we'll take less damage.
[158:58.73]I don't know if the miniguns are not effective at this range.
[159:02.99]I'm actually doing okay.
[159:03.73]Why isn't this not repairing?
[159:05.83]Why is this not repairing?
[159:07.37]oh oh I also need the thrusters recharged done what's going on oh yeah the big damage okay we almost got it I'm gonna fly us in here I'm gonna ulti for it
[159:33.96]Maybe you should multi.
[159:35.56]Oh shit, is that OK?
[159:36.36]I'm just gonna.
[159:38.79]No.
[159:41.07]I knew it was coming now running within power network tolerance.
[159:51.64]Power overload.
[159:57.27]Oh, I can't even I can't.
[159:59.65]I've overloaded it for a little bit just so we could shoot a little more.
[160:04.42]okay I'm driving us in oh yeah you got it alright turning my gun off once again oh god oh my god oh man man man that's oh shit's messed up right now I need boosters I got it shields are somehow holding alert the hollow adversary is preparing a powerful attack
[160:42.64]that was awesome cool boy jump signature detected did we get something for that yep uh I think this is our first relic wounded frenzy
[161:11.47]do we have the suck machine to turn on suck is available you can turn off the extractor beam during boss fights believers always win I'm gonna kill that supply drop yep gravity scoop has retrieved an item each active defect grants improved fire rate for weapons improved forward speed
[161:41.87]Seems good, I guess.
[161:44.50]Prepare void drive.
[161:45.34]Yes, sir.
[161:48.20]Should we repair the hull first, or are we still playing?
[161:51.37]Yeah, we can do both.
[161:52.99]I'm having fun.
[161:54.59]I'm enjoying it.
[161:55.32]Yeah, I'll keep going.
[161:56.88]Alright, cool, cool.
[161:59.40]I mean, there's another mission.
[162:01.03]We're not done, right?
[162:02.65]No, we got more.
[162:03.57]There's another thing right after this.
[162:12.20]think we have a whole another like roguelike level we've got nine minutes I think we should get out there and do some repairs real quick alright how do I repair you just need to leave the ship and go to the the minor repairs you can always do I think the major ones you need an item okay okay yeah there's a lot of major we don't we don't have the money for uh major repairs right now
[162:45.49]hull repaired integrity above 20 20 we're kind of screwed uh did we get that relic on board was that something cool yeah it means that when we have defects our guns shoot faster oh sorry and that's what that was yeah so that's that's really good if we are in combat we'll just keep shooting faster and faster until we waste all of our ammo and die
[163:18.26]That's as much as we... Captain, that's as much as we can get her.
[163:22.21]37%.
[163:22.53]Yeah.
[163:25.93]That's it.
[163:26.41]You're going to have to get me more.
[163:30.00]I can't do it, Captain.
[163:32.12]It takes three months.
[163:34.24]And then in the episode, he just does it in five minutes.
[163:38.87]Vinny.
[163:40.54]If I may, I just made the most scrumptious cake, and if you wanted to try it, it has a sauce from the planet Nemo.
[163:52.93]Where's my smoke?
[163:55.60]Mr. Data, your cake sounds delicious.
[163:58.32]Hey, can you taste the cherry?
[164:00.68]Chad, he doesn't know who it is.
[164:01.74]It's Neelix.
[164:03.73]He knows.
[164:04.51]I wish it wasn't, but yeah, it's Neelix.
[164:11.25]we are we're still 37 that major hole breach is what's uh active defect mean I think our whole breach is probably a defect are you talking about the relic are you examining the relic yeah so that means he he knew what it was he just didn't want to acknowledge because he didn't want to I mean do you I Neelix is my favorite character okay
[164:42.17]them we we just end up being more powerful so uh there might be a lot of new people on the channel the last like year or two that is not my favorite character I don't care at all about that character do you like voyager I love voyager yeah what's your favorite series of Star Trek Jerma yeah uh one at a time please but what was it which which one's your favorite in a chair
[165:10.58]OK, I liked next generation.
[165:14.25]I think that's just always going to be probably good up there.
[165:21.40]I thought Voyager was fun though.
[165:22.66]I thought that the the I thought the actual setting of Voyager in the actual episodes were a little more interesting than some of the other series.
[165:32.15]yeah I wish it capitalized on its premise a little bit more but I do like it I I just think um for me it's all about deep space nine and tng next generation yeah those are my those are my two dude the episode where they they went through that field as voyager when they went through that weird field and the rest of the episode they figured out that they were clones of the whole crew that was a banger episode
[165:59.08]I don't remember that one.
[166:00.68]Well, I don't want to spoil the episode, but it's a cool episode.
[166:03.91]Oh, it's a spoiler?
[166:04.65]Well, fucking whatever.
[166:06.15]I definitely have seen it.
[166:07.32]I just don't remember it.
[166:08.76]Everyone in my chat's mad about it.
[166:10.88]Do you remember one of their own descendants?
[166:14.35]Like, they're dead on the planet?
[166:16.09]I do.
[166:16.49]Oh, wait, no, that's Deep Space Nine.
[166:18.03]There's one where they're in orbit, and people, like, evolve a religion to, like, Voyager that's in the sky.
[166:24.28]And they send, like, a probe up there eventually when they develop spaceflight.
[166:28.66]I didn't see a whole lot of Deep Space Nine.
[166:32.95]I mean, that one was Voyager.
[166:34.17]That one I just described as Voyager.
[166:36.17]Oh, okay.
[166:37.51]Yeah, I'll be honest.
[166:39.86]There's some good ones.
[166:42.10]Voyager for me was one of those things where the whole entire series just played from start to finish in one viewing.
[166:51.59]Over the course of like four days, it was just on the television.
[166:56.03]Right.
[166:56.49]I may have missed a few.
[167:00.29]my god yeah there's there's a lot there's there's many many episodes okay guys I need you to I'm ready I need you to sit down unless we're going to move some of the guns around uh I think I'll keep the guns on one side for now and then we can adjust as needed there's also an episode where Tom Paris becomes a lizard and has sex with janeway
[167:30.04]Remember that?
[167:33.30]Oh God, that episode.
[167:34.44]It's considered the worst one of the entire series.
[167:37.89]What's the Seth MacFarlane parody Star Trek show?
[167:41.03]Oh, she was the lizard.
[167:42.07]Oh, the Orville.
[167:43.53]Is it good?
[167:43.95]I haven't seen it.
[167:45.21]I liked it a lot.
[167:46.29]I would very much recommend it.
[167:53.16]Oh my God, I stood up.
[167:56.80]They were both lizards.
[167:58.02]Oh God, I should watch that episode again.
[168:02.41]I think we're going to die here little pups.
[168:04.57]You think so?
[168:05.13]Why?
[168:06.05]The mission.
[168:07.59]I have to scan these cargoes.
[168:09.47]We have to find one cargo ship that has an ancient data shard in it.
[168:13.02]And then we're done.
[168:13.68]But there's a lot of cargo.
[168:15.02]It's going to be the third one on the left.
[168:18.14]That one.
[168:22.85]I think we listened to Poke.
[168:25.15]I scanned it.
[168:26.41]But that's also near enemies.
[168:28.21]So I'm going to get this easy one.
[168:29.46]Because they all probably have loot.
[168:33.39]alright okay okay captain uh because if we can get some alloys so that we can repair that would be pog champion that would be good signature detected I would totally ResidentSleeper at that power overload circuit breakers at capacity circuit breakers overloaded
[169:02.63]yeah I'm gonna turn off one of the uh things here there you go uh you turned on okay shields oops one of the guys still overloaded we need to suck in this alloy and if we can get a repair kit suck is on alright well okay well we need to suck power grid now operating within acceptable levels
[169:29.19]What the hell?
[169:32.00]Do you see this?
[169:33.72]Yeah, that's kind of weird.
[169:35.68]Vinny was just kind of lounging.
[169:39.03]Are we able to buy the repairs?
[169:43.27]System Upgrader.
[169:44.99]Upgrades an installed system module when used.
[169:48.88]Huh.
[169:53.90]Wait, what is it?
[169:55.79]This upgrades a system module.
[169:57.77]This is apparently amazing.
[170:00.79]Upgrade power.
[170:01.93]Yeah, how do I upgrade power?
[170:04.50]I found the right one.
[170:05.96]Sorry, Poke, you were wrong.
[170:08.16]It's best on a Mark II.
[170:12.90]If you want to see it, yeah.
[170:15.53]Or did I?
[170:16.71]Ooh.
[170:19.25]Oh, you put it on a Mark II to make it a Mark III, right?
[170:21.75]Yeah.
[170:23.91]That's pretty good.
[170:27.55]If we... okay, so here's the thing, if we hold on to this a little bit... Yeah.
[170:33.39]And we get a mark two power, and then upgrade it immediately, we're gonna be in really good shape.
[170:41.10]So I think we... we... we wait.
[170:43.35]I think we... we hold off.
[170:45.99]Okay.
[170:47.37]Uh, timer hasn't started until we, like, engage someone, so I'm chilling until we're ready.
[170:53.64]Just charging up the power cells.
[171:00.12]if we have enough alloy to repair we should do it we don't okay we need um you know what we do okay I'm gonna get rid of this thruster booster station anomalous jump signature uh I'm house by the way I see what's going on in the chat over here I'm house plus item we are almost out of alloys
[171:27.59]I'm gonna repair uh we need two but I have one currently so here we go it's fine just something to get us going a little bit bush light is that what he said
[171:55.92]Paul repaired integrity above 50 okay that's currently probably where we're gonna end up alright we can get guns on and I'm gonna fly us in I'm gonna pull the power out I don't even give a go are we ready to grab this crate without anyone noticing
[172:26.43]actually yeah proximity mines approaching we have to shoot it yeah there you go yep that's it that's the data shard alright we need the uh suck on oh these mines are coming at us these mines are coming at us you're the one driving the car
[172:46.38]I'm you're the one with the guns press the wrong button I I don't know how to shoot them without hurting us power network operating within tolerance levels oh so I should not have increased in power okay I'm going in for the suck we there we got other mines around it though these mines need to be shot
[173:11.74]I can't.
[173:12.36]My gun's in a weird spot.
[173:15.02]Over here.
[173:15.60]Got it.
[173:16.17]I'm turning.
[173:16.79]This thing doesn't have any power.
[173:25.68]Fighters!
[173:26.30]We got fighters!
[173:28.50]Jerma, you are now powered up.
[173:29.48]We're overloaded.
[173:30.60]We're overloaded.
[173:34.85]Proximity mines approaching.
[173:37.67]We won't be overloaded in 10 seconds.
[173:40.77]yeah as long as Jerm is shooting we're gonna be alright let's clear these fighters I'm working on it right now do we need the vacuum on or no uh yes it's on another shuriken gatling okay I'm going for the objective and there's a whole bunch of stuff here
[174:11.04]kind of whole bunch of stuff uh like items to pick up there's like three things there's a beam caster over there this is mine I don't think I have a shimmy left mount is the right there not on I can break that thing you want it yeah it's on we have three things coming in I got it
[174:39.05]good stuff really good stuff uh upload data shard into the astral map and we're actually done really that was it yep we got lucky and found it quick and it was not near enemies that's good damn but there's more items we can pick up over here when we clear these fighters yeah we need items
[175:01.24]uh we have their minds I don't know if you guys if they're hard to see but it's hard to pick these stuffs up because there's proximity mines everywhere hostile reinforcement
[175:27.06]Guys?

[179:43.95]alright nice mission that was very very close we got a lot of stuff did we complete a run did we do a full run we beat the first boss I assume there's more because this area too looks different the purple purple space effective versus shields so we got a couple things here

[180:50.99]I'll drive.
[180:51.63]Where are we going?
[180:53.44]I don't know id thruster happening what do we do do we die is this death I'm getting the out of here I get off get off the pilot I'm back we got so many hull breaches yeah this was like the absolute worst possible time for something like that to happen I think we have to destroy that
[181:17.76]I'm gonna try and see if I can get us somewhere safe behind this debris and we can repair there's no way we can just like leave and now our objective is escape destroy the pillar I put us behind this wall can we repair now quick we don't have repairs we don't have any kids can we buy them do we have one minor repair to do I have a major I have money for major I'll go outside a Jerm here's what we're gonna do let's let's scrap
[181:46.53]This needs to happen fast.
[181:47.47]There's things coming for us.
[181:50.39]What if we recycle a system upgrader and get a bunch of alloy, no?
[181:55.06]We could.
[181:56.02]We could.
[181:56.74]There is a mine following us that needs to get shot.
[181:59.17]It's 25 alloy.
[182:01.19]It gives us a... What the fuck just happened?
[182:03.11]There is a mine following us that needs to get shot.
[182:07.30]do it if you want if you think it's going to keep us alive I think we should do it this is going to kill us guys I tried shooting it jeez why did we get attacked damn I do you know what happened we didn't use our upgrades
[182:33.26]not that that was the reason we died we got died because of we got died because of an ambush oh man that's kind of crazy we sure did got died we're gonna get a bunch of crates to open oh that's that's a shame that was fun though we did a good job I think I think if we come back to this we're ready for the bigger ship
[183:02.99]and by the way there's you could do up to six players so if we wanted like a cluster cluster we could definitely we could definitely make that happen I like the game the game is fun yeah yeah great it seems like a perfect game like we come back to it in the future with our upgrades especially knowing how to play was like learning took a while I get it it's cool I had to relearn the whole goddamn thing open your purple boxes guys
[183:30.63]Dude, we're going to have so many upgrades.
[183:40.48]Yeah, it was cute.
[183:41.10]I like it.
[183:48.27]I just got a big upgrade too.
[183:49.65]Damn.
[183:52.02]A lot of upgrades.
[183:52.90]So if we play it again, like I'm so much stronger.
[183:55.24]What?
[183:56.50]Oh, that is crazy.
[184:03.59]yeah that's so many more points that was a lot of fun though it's kind of a slow start but I think it kind of had to be you can claim if you click on career you can claim like stuff
[184:34.00]mmm these upgrades are really strong too yeah but I don't know what the plan is after this I don't we might be doing something else or if not then I'm gonna make my character in oblivion we'll see if they want to do something also uh so are we moving on or is is uh Jerma leaving us is everyone leaving
[184:57.72]if you're doing oblivion then I'll do rim world from you know on my own but it's uh either way yeah I'm I'm game for whatever you guys are leaving I'm gonna play some arc raiders because it's two days access oh okay but if you guys want to play a game I'm down for a new game too well let me I want to take a I gotta I gotta go to the bathroom I've been holding it for an hour or two okay

[185:57.35]It seems like it would be kind of quick.
[185:59.81]uh the just act natural game yeah oh yeah that seems like a good option we could like do half hour of that and then we could all go off and do our own shit that sounds good let's do it alright get the void crew out of our head the mind sickness from the space mind sickness uh I'll be right back I'm gonna I'm gonna be and then we can play uh the other game yeah okay the secret penis mind sickness alright but yeah no this is awesome this is a lot of fun
