[00:23.04]Hey guys, it's me, David.
[00:24.02]I decided to take over the stream tonight.
[00:28.34]What do you think about my voice?
[00:29.54]A little bit better than Jeremy's, don't you think?
[00:32.84]I think so.
[00:34.46]A little bit deeper, a little bit more full of belly, you know what I mean?
[00:38.75]By the way, Jeremy got all of his comedy from me.
[00:43.19]I can guarantee you that one.
[00:45.99]You like the sound of my voice?
[00:47.25]You like the smooth sound of my voice?
[00:49.25]I do too.
[00:54.58]Yeah, we're an hour and a half late don't who cares We are gonna play
[01:10.29]No Demon's Souls tonight.
[01:11.65]We're gonna step away from PlayStation 3.
[01:13.04]We're gonna step away from... I'm all fucked up, you know?
[01:18.70]Like, I'm not, like, drinking.
[01:20.46]I've had, like, a coffee earlier.
[01:21.51]I had, like, a tuna sandwich earlier.
[01:24.15]I got a disease.
[01:25.93]Some of you guys know what it is.
[01:26.87]It's a pain in the ass.
[01:27.71]Literally.
[01:28.35]Figuratively.
[01:29.31]Metaphorically.
[01:31.15]Bigly.
[01:31.46]You know what I mean?
[01:33.28]Not fun.
[01:37.35]I love how I just say, I got a disease.
[01:40.40]Yeah, you know, guys, here's the problem.
[01:42.44]I got a disease.
[01:46.46]What an easy way to, like, excuse yourself from doing anything.
[01:50.44]Hey, dude, how come you were late an hour and a half to your own stream?
[01:53.63]I got a disease.
[01:54.91]Oh, okay.
[01:56.83]Um, how come you didn't split the check with us earlier this afternoon?
[02:01.15]I got a disease.
[02:02.69]Oh, okay.
[02:04.54]Um...
[02:05.91]Is there a reason why you can't show up to, like, my daughter's wedding?
[02:08.82]I got a disease.
[02:10.04]Okay.
[02:15.02]Let's tweet this.
[02:20.44]Oh, okay.
[02:22.77]Anyways... Let me just get a couple of things situated.
[02:26.99]Hang on to your... Hold on to your seats.
[02:29.05]I just saw a guy do a ResidentSleeper.
[02:31.13]Hold on to your seats, man.
[02:33.69]Not yet.
[02:34.15]I'll be right back.
[02:37.15]And don't touch anything.
[02:38.43]What's that from?
[02:39.30]A hundred points to whoever gets it.
[03:14.06]The guy that said Monkey Island, you're correct.
[03:15.82]It's the guy that owns the store that leaves.
[03:18.72]And lets, you know, exactly.
[03:20.46]The old guy, like the old prospector guy.
[03:24.82]Okay, I think we are ready to start this video game.
[03:36.61]I'm ready.
[03:38.21]I'm ready to play Aeon Flux, the video game.
[03:41.17]Should be fun.
[03:46.55]So, whoa, what are you thinking there?
[03:50.15]Hopefully this is not too loud, I hope.
[03:53.26]If you have no idea what the hell's going on in this game, don't worry, neither do I. We're gonna experience this together, okay?
[04:01.62]This is pretty much the game, right here.
[04:03.62]This is all you do.
[04:05.40]Alright, let me get the chat in the right spot.
[04:07.21]Chat is in the right spot.
[04:11.23]What's that?
[04:11.49]Look over there!
[04:15.19]I got the first joke of the evening.
[04:16.23]It's perfect.
[04:17.87]Settings.
[04:19.05]Difficulty master.
[04:21.33]See, I can't even get the... I'm locked.
[04:23.13]No, normal.
[04:24.23]Game mode, normal.
[04:25.99]What does that even mean?
[04:27.33]Blood on.
[04:29.15]Vibrations off.
[04:31.39]I don't want my controller rumbling around.
[04:36.29]Are you guys ready for a good stream?
[04:40.01]Yes, you are.
[04:41.59]You guys think this is going to be a bad stream?
[04:44.76]That's what I thought, ladies and gentlemen, that's what I thought.
[04:49.21]Uh, should we talk about politics?
[04:50.81]Don't you dare!
[04:51.69]Alright, let's go.
[04:56.43]I have no, I have no, I only know it was this game, like the game kills you, you try to kill, like, you.
[05:00.49]You, the flesh and the soul shall enter the palace through separate doors.
[05:05.91]Only the strong of mind and body will again renounce as a whole from the collective memories.
[05:08.99]All our songs were invited.
[05:11.97]A magical place of life without end.
[05:14.87]Sorry for the loudness.
[05:16.96]It's every video game.
[05:19.08]Watch out for the block of fucking moon cheese.
[05:20.96]But only for the word.
[05:22.28]Watch out for the NAS cartridge.
[05:24.28]I'm in a fucking weird mood.
[05:25.12]So all lives were desperately dedicated to qualify.
[05:29.19]Pinpoint perspective on the great reward.
[05:33.63]Only... I never wanted to go.
[05:39.47]It's the new iPhone.
[05:40.23]I'm not shit-faced.
[05:41.27]I'm not drinking.
[05:42.21]Character creator.
[05:42.81]Here we go.
[05:43.09]No character creator.
[06:03.98]Watch me just burp in the camera's face.
[06:06.28]Can you open this jar for me?
[06:07.76]Of course I can open a fucking jar.
[06:09.31]Hold on, let me just make sure.
[06:10.31]I feel like shit.
[06:13.25]Of course you do.
[06:15.05]Your wound has healed.
[06:17.37]The pain is from the stasis and will last within a week.
[06:21.47]The nausea will linger, probably intensify when you start to realize that more than a hundred years have passed.
[06:28.75]That's your strong fucking boyfriend right there.
[06:31.37]Thanks.
[06:40.60]That's all gone now.
[06:43.86]So you decided not to like me.
[06:46.65]But you've had a century to plan what to say, and that's it?
[06:52.33]How about you screwed up the best deal we ever had, or you come waltzing in here giving orders?
[07:00.66]Or even... What's happening?
[07:02.26]What happened?
[07:02.84]Because of you, you stupid idiot.
[07:05.10]You stupid idiot.
[07:07.76]Did something bad happen?
[07:13.43]This is gonna be a weird stream.
[07:17.95]Oh, that's my fucking vaporizer!
[07:25.20]Dude, that's a fucking, like, $300 vape machine, dude!
[07:28.24]Alright, I gotta fucking concentrate.
[07:31.48]Hold on a minute.
[07:33.32]I don't know how you hope to achieve that little bit, but it's just... What?
[07:40.20]Why do I have, like, a bullet wound in my back?
[07:41.52]And why is nothing... Why can I not hear anything?
[07:45.58]What's going on?
[07:47.92]Mind.
[07:48.26]Mind.
[07:51.14]Oh my god, this camera.
[07:52.64]Alright, there we go.
[07:53.54]Hold on a minute.
[07:54.86]This is the most... This is the oddest fucking third-person camera I've ever used.
[07:57.92]Alright.
[08:04.40]A, B. I got, like, huge bones in my shoulders.
[08:08.47]I got good shoulder bones.
[08:09.59]That's good.
[08:14.57]I like the atmosphere so far.
[08:15.79]Good atmosphere.
[08:19.25]Already a solid 10 out of fucking... I lost my train of thought in the middle of that.
[08:27.11]It's easy to say 10 out of 10.
[08:29.79]Did I lose my train of thought after saying the number 10?
[08:31.89]It's not creepy at all.
[08:44.60]This game's good, trust me.
[08:51.55]What means there's nothing in here?
[08:58.53]Apparently it takes like 30 or 40 minutes to get into the game here.
[09:03.14]Just listen to the weird like baby lady voice, the baby voice.
[09:12.16]This is too artsy, it's not.
[09:15.24]Don't worry.
[09:16.50]This game is going to be great.
[09:21.10]It's telling me to go this way with the magical fucking slot machine.
[09:24.50]Bonus round.
[09:25.42]Light.
[09:25.64]Game's too quiet?
[09:26.86]Ah, fuck.
[09:27.20]Hold on.
[09:27.50]Just read for a moment.
[09:38.40]Yeah, just fucking read for a moment.
[09:44.32]That's too loud.
[09:45.56]Hold on, just read a minute.
[09:49.79]You guys have like some... None of you guys did your fucking summer reading.
[09:52.27]You don't think I know?
[09:53.65]I think I broke everything.
[09:57.09]God damn it.
[10:01.13]Okay, then we... I...
[10:04.54]Would you please?
[10:06.04]Okay, I don't have very much more patience for this shit.
[10:08.48]It's staying the way it is.
[10:09.66]I don't give a... It's like... I can't even alt-tab on my... You know, who cares?
[10:15.89]None of you guys did your summer reading anyway.
[10:20.09]Like, you don't think that I know you didn't read The Call of the Wild?
[10:22.77]Of course you didn't.
[10:24.99]I know you didn't.
[10:26.31]You looked up the Cliff Notes.
[10:29.72]You went to cliffnotes.com.
[10:38.24]That's why I read forward.
[10:38.98]No, you have to read.
[10:42.60]What is going on?
[10:47.31]What did I do?
[10:48.07]I didn't do anything.
[10:52.81]Look, listen to me.
[10:55.48]This game takes like 30 or 40 minutes to get started, but let me explain to you what this game is, because I read up a couple of reviews and I read a couple of very, very close friends of mine that work for game publishing companies.
[11:06.07]Like, literally, these are very close friends of mine that work in the industry.
[11:10.53]I mean, you got David, he's one.
[11:13.81]He told me that this game was a fantastic experience.
[11:16.87]Essentially, you train yourself to kill yourself.
[11:20.69]It's weird.
[11:21.29]Like, the game records your every movement, and then the game then tries to kill you as you.
[11:27.13]But you're you.
[11:28.57]It's a strange game.
[11:29.51]Really strange.
[11:29.99]But fucking Dave gave me a very, very close, close extreme level of determination for how to be.
[11:36.06]I just said, like, nine adjectives.
[11:37.30]Let's go.
[11:43.70]You know Dave?
[11:44.24]No, I know Dave.
[11:49.91]By the way, everyone that told me to turn this up, I hope you're ready for the cutscene to blow your eardrums out.
[11:58.73]Are you okay?
[11:59.39]No.
[12:01.73]Absolutely not.
[12:04.77]Guys, this is a grabback.
[12:06.95]This is a grabback novel.
[12:08.25]This was interpreted from a grabback novel.
[12:10.93]He also wrote the thong panty e... What do I do?
[12:16.40]Click it.
[12:18.02]Yeah, he wrote like E for panties.
[12:19.53]That's like what he said.
[12:20.71]That was one of his more classic novels.
[12:26.35]I need a suit.
[12:27.63]This is so loud.
[12:29.86]This is what I was afraid of.
[12:53.76]Next.
[12:54.96]No.
[12:55.42]I don't see anything but ice.
[12:57.56]It's not ice.
[12:59.50]I don't know that we can even trust what we see.
[13:02.27]Got it.
[13:02.97]That's okay right there.
[13:04.11]Look at that R-Wing.
[13:04.69]Oh, no Demon's Souls today.
[13:05.37]We're playing Echo tonight.
[13:07.53]No, I can't.
[13:08.25]The whole screen is white.
[13:10.47]No palace, though.
[13:32.03]I'm guessing it's some corporate state's illegitimate mining project from the prerequisition rush.
[13:37.00]That's too quiet.
[13:38.56]No.
[13:40.76]The planet is most likely depleted of all resources.
[13:43.24]An empty shell.
[13:45.18]I hope the old man didn't pay too much for the coordinates.
[13:47.65]That's pretty sick.
[13:49.29]That's a pretty sick Legos.
[13:54.49]I just glanced at him.
[13:56.02]I was reaching so hard.
[13:57.90]That's a pretty sick Legos.
[14:00.78]Oh god, what a- I'm not prepared.
[14:02.63]I was gonna say, like, something.
[14:07.05]Way better than that.
[14:07.87]No, these are glaciers, man.
[14:12.69]Play some shitty PlayStation 3- No, we gotta- Look, I get shit all the time.
[14:16.21]You guys give me shit for not playing new games.
[14:18.83]This is a new game, extremely highly rated, and lots of potential for fucking LOL, goofy, funny, TotalBiscuit, LUL moments.
[14:26.42]You know what I mean?
[14:26.94]That's coming up.
[14:29.86]Trust me.
[14:30.72]You gotta trust me.
[14:33.24]TotalBiscuit is gonna laugh his ass off at this game.
[14:35.83]I'm telling you.
[14:36.65]What a strange place.
[14:41.11]It's impressive, really.
[14:44.25]Alright, so how do I get off the cube?
[14:47.82]Okay.
[14:49.80]You're gonna finally give me the tutorial.
[14:56.57]Oh, you gave me a hula hoop.
[14:59.35]This is so bright.
[15:00.29]What am I interacting with?
[15:06.56]Oh, that thing.
[15:14.66]Okay.
[15:16.70]Did I release it?
[15:20.25]Press all the buttons.
[15:22.81]Yeah, this is another giant button.
[15:26.69]What about this?
[15:29.59]Another button to press?
[15:34.20]I got a gun.
[15:34.70]That's a weird place to holster a gun.
[15:36.58]Doesn't that feel like it's hard to get?
[15:41.34]That's gonna be difficult to reach.
[15:42.44]Why wouldn't you put it, like, tape it to your chest?
[15:50.20]Nice.
[15:50.42]Just got the shortcut.
[15:56.37]Alright, what did that do?
[15:59.91]Is there, like, a ladder to climb down?
[16:01.25]Yeah, there is.
[16:02.99]Okay.
[16:12.54]So, how do I jump?
[16:13.52]Okay, it's just like Legend of Zelda.
[16:17.28]Or Dark Souls.
[16:17.98]It's just like Dark Souls.
[16:19.61]Atmosphere's pretty good.
[16:20.59]I like the atmosphere.
[16:21.39]Alright, when do they start?
[16:24.31]Suit.
[16:24.65]Energy.
[16:24.81]Advanced use.
[16:25.25]Tab.
[16:40.19]Cell meter.
[16:40.55]The suit stores energy in cells.
[16:42.40]The cell meter visualizes your total capacity and current charge.
[16:45.02]Massive triangles are charged and hollow triangles are empty.
[16:48.86]Right.
[16:51.20]Okay.
[16:52.60]Cell charges.
[16:53.36]It fills up two slots if it's worth two.
[16:57.56]It needs to be enough yellow charges.
[16:59.18]Auto charging.
[17:01.28]Okay.
[17:02.74]I don't know.
[17:03.58]But we gotta get through the... I just opened up the fucking windows tab.
[17:08.44]Can I jump down here?
[17:11.82]Alright.
[17:15.84]I would like to run.
[17:19.40]You can't make that jump.
[17:20.88]You need to go around.
[17:23.68]Okay.
[17:27.83]Is there a button there?
[17:30.39]This is really cool.
[17:31.19]No, trust me.
[17:31.87]Everybody that's here right now, just stick around.
[17:34.85]You're going to want to stick around for this.
[17:41.68]trust me if there's one thing I can guarantee you guys is that this game is going to be worth playing I guarantee it I'm going to give you the Arnold elbertson guarantee you understand a composite like that should last forever why would I play neck it must be ancient and look um look I'm gonna look and by the way by the way nobody said happy birthday to me
[18:10.71]My birthday is in fucking three hours.
[18:13.63]Nobody said happy birthday?
[18:17.07]Am I gonna be one of those guys that has to tell everybody, hey, you know, remember, it's my birthday.
[18:21.49]Apparently not.
[18:22.17]Apparently nobody cares about me.
[18:25.14]I'm gonna be streaming on my birthday.
[18:28.24]Because we're definitely gonna be going past, probably, I would assume, midnight.
[18:39.35]Nobody even said happy name day.
[18:43.07]This voice is so familiar.
[18:48.17]At midnight, we're going to do a happy birthday midnight extract.
[18:51.39]We're going to count down the new year.
[18:52.64]I'm doing a birthday countdown.
[19:07.62]Where am I supposed to be going?
[19:21.19]Put a countdown on it.
[19:21.93]Just fall off.
[19:22.99]Okay.
[19:23.17]Am I supposed to be ascending or descending?
[19:27.41]Why couldn't I jump through that?
[19:49.20]Can I walk any faster?
[19:50.12]I wish you could.
[19:54.36]What?
[19:55.36]I just... I asked it to and it did it.
[19:57.00]And now... Wait, what?
[20:00.88]I promised you that I could not run before.
[20:08.97]I didn't press any new buttons.
[20:12.35]Oh, fucking God.
[20:13.27]Where the hell... Like, what is this?
[20:19.21]Did I, like... I think I'm going over here.
[20:31.64]This is what I get for not paying any attention.
[20:34.46]To this, like, interconnected maze fucking tutorial level.
[20:44.31]Already lost.
[20:48.06]It did say the suit responds to your voice.
[20:57.02]Did I like... No, here we go.
[20:59.66]Thank God.
[21:00.16]Get me the fuck out of here.
[21:07.45]Save game.
[21:11.27]Yes, slippery.
[21:12.33]Please tell me you're not going to give me a tutorial to grab the ledge.
[21:14.68]No.
[21:19.10]What exactly are these structures, then?
[21:20.58]Have you seen others like them?
[21:24.04]Quick, do a joke.
[21:25.26]I'm not going to need to later.
[21:26.48]...share of halls based on wild speculation.
[21:29.66]It doesn't matter if it comes from desperate need or delusions of grandeur.
[21:33.38]There's never anything there but bitter disappointment.
[21:37.69]Yeah.
[21:39.39]Okay.
[21:40.63]How the hell are you?
[21:43.12]I'm alright.
[21:45.38]Uh... Like, we're gonna keep going this way.
[21:59.81]What's with the awful, unreadable subtitles?
[22:01.53]You know, that's a good question.
[22:03.39]I also have a question for you.
[22:05.05]Um...
[22:06.89]Why is this in the game?
[22:10.37]I'm sorry.
[22:13.37]I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[22:15.13]Forget what I just said.
[22:25.50]Let's walk.
[22:27.08]Let's walk up and down like narrow structures.
[22:29.94]And they got me!
[22:31.83]Wait, I think I'm okay.
[22:34.54]I swear to God, the game hears me.
[22:35.94]Is that part of the game?
[22:39.88]That's not part of the game, right?
[22:40.72]It's like... Ask for a gun.
[22:41.78]Every time I talk shit, it does something.
[22:44.68]He trusted you and said that I could too.
[22:47.28]That you would help me.
[22:47.96]Foster didn't leave
[23:04.65]One sec.
[23:05.91]I understand.
[23:06.97]Completely.
[23:07.91]This is what happens when you make a game and you hire famous people to be in your game.
[23:17.21]Your lead character is like a famous movie star or whatever, like a famous actor.
[23:21.92]And you have to give a bunch of dialog, otherwise it wasn't worth the ton of money that it cost to hire this person.
[23:28.52]Now I understand.
[23:29.16]Okay, let's go.
[23:32.21]You don't mess up a job for your grandfather and then team up with the person you were sent out to in the first place.
[23:39.04]I think I understand.
[23:41.48]You could have just handed me back.
[23:43.26]You really are naive.
[23:44.06]If this was some random... If I was doing this voice, the opening of this game would be like eight minutes long.
[23:49.27]I warned Foster about you resourcefuls.
[23:58.57]I can't even fucking alt-tab out of this goddamn game.
[24:03.05]I have to do it, like, in the game, because I literally can't even fucking alt-tab to go to my other monitor.
[24:09.10]In fact, I can't even do it here.
[24:11.20]Why can I not move the fucking mouse?
[24:13.76]Oh, man.
[24:14.48]Oh, man.
[24:21.18]It's like playing skee-ball.
[24:22.26]I gotta get it in the right spot.
[24:24.16]Are you kidding me?
[24:28.72]How's that?
[24:33.62]God, I hope this is worth playing.
[24:34.68]I love how it randomly runs sometimes.
[24:44.18]If this, like, was this main actor, if this lead actor was one of the programmers, like, sisters or something, the intro wouldn't have been this long.
[25:01.21]Sounds exactly the same.
[25:10.03]Lovecraftian.
[25:10.83]It's a pretty cool location.
[25:12.96]I'm liking it.
[25:15.00]Just think about the egg.
[25:16.84]That's usually what I do.
[25:18.94]Whenever I get in a situation where... It looks like nothing of the sort.
[25:27.80]Just being contradictory.
[25:29.04]I for one am liking this game.
[25:31.64]Oh, I know, I enjoy it, but... Write a fucking book.
[25:33.48]Sorry.
[25:53.09]I got the brief.
[25:54.63]Not much of an extraction.
[25:55.77]Brief me.
[25:56.65]No one giving a shit about you where you dug down.
[25:59.18]The way he said that was very shit.
[25:59.94]The only challenge Foss could see was that your grandfather wanted you to willingly hand back whatever it was you stole from him.
[26:06.76]Funny to hear that from you.
[26:09.56]And you can't even jump off to make a funny, like, total... You can't even make, like, a total biscuit LUL right here.
[26:14.64]I'm telling you, this game's gonna be fun.
[26:16.34]Just let it play out.
[26:35.39]Let them drop like the fucking $195,000 it was to have this person here.
[26:41.41]We get it.
[26:42.25]I get it.
[26:43.35]It's alright.
[26:44.57]World building.
[26:45.27]Story building.
[26:46.17]This game completely came out of fucking nowhere, by the way.
[26:48.59]What a great title so far.
[26:50.64]I'm not going to give anybody shit.
[26:53.14]This is great so far.
[26:54.72]Don't listen to me.
[26:56.46]They bought an expensive actress and needed to give her like 95,000 lines.
[26:59.22]I need some force.
[27:01.40]Does a gun pack any punch?
[27:08.05]Well, this aiming is way more to be desired.
[27:14.14]That sensitivity is odd.
[27:16.42]What?
[27:17.90]Why?
[27:18.97]What the fuck?
[27:21.53]Thanks for shooting the one bullet.
[27:22.81]You can now no longer use that gun.
[27:25.71]But please go to the funhouse.
[27:40.01]He heard you.
[27:41.03]Again, they're listening to me.
[27:43.21]Do I have to shoot this one?
[27:48.78]This really is a Dark Souls level.
[27:51.02]What?
[27:52.08]Is this a scary game?
[27:55.76]No, it's not.
[27:57.37]I've read the reviews.
[28:00.46]The review said, hey Jeremy, when you're playing this game, just be careful.
[28:03.72]It's a really interesting start.
[28:05.23]Very boring start.
[28:07.03]Not good.
[28:07.97]Boring.
[28:09.17]After 45 minutes, get out of town.
[28:10.97]Fucking one of the best games to come out in the whole year.
[28:19.88]I like the architecture.
[28:20.68]And I like the bathroom tile.
[28:26.01]Paid reviews.
[28:29.31]This is not a sponsored stream.
[28:30.71]I would have to put it in the title.
[28:31.77]It would say, Check it out!
[28:33.13]Lawbreakers!
[28:34.79]Sponsored, baby!
[28:38.89]Doesn't even matter what game I'm playing.
[28:40.23]It would say, Sponsored by Lawbreakers.
[28:44.35]You know?
[28:48.09]Where the fuck am I going?
[28:52.52]Which one of these is an elevator?
[29:04.14]Sponsored.
[29:06.48]There we go.
[29:06.78]Lawbreakers, what a good joke.
[29:08.42]That was low effort.
[29:10.07]Yeah, that was a low energy, low effort joke.
[29:12.05]You're right.
[29:22.24]Yeah, that was low energy.
[29:23.18]That was low effort.
[29:24.20]Shouting.
[29:24.70]What?
[29:47.56]Wait, there's a shout button.
[29:49.54]That's okay.
[29:50.36]Now the gate this game got a little more interesting A little better is you could just you're gonna say we're gonna say hello I like it now Don't give me that opportunity to do that
[30:14.64]I'm gonna run into somebody.
[30:15.62]Alright, sooner or later.
[30:20.94]There we go.
[30:21.66]See those two eyes?
[30:23.10]That's a person, right?
[30:27.07]That's me.
[30:27.77]That's a mirror.
[30:28.49]Okay.
[30:29.45]Well, I found me.
[30:31.53]This is where it gets weird.
[30:32.97]I'm telling you guys right now.
[30:35.45]This is where... They're just getting you prepared for what's gonna happen later.
[30:40.63]Whatever you do in this game, it does it again and they come and kill you.
[30:43.53]You come and kill you.
[30:46.59]I'm telling you.
[30:48.03]Give it a chance.
[30:54.58]What was that?
[30:56.68]Oh, it's a shadow.
[31:01.62]What am I talking about?
[31:02.36]You'll see.
[31:06.92]It's a very, very interesting, very surprising mechanic.
[31:09.00]Mm-hmm.
[31:09.14]Yeah, maybe it's some kind of door.
[31:11.00]A door thing?
[31:11.48]Mm-hmm.
[31:11.62]Well, gotta go turn the door on.
[31:35.23]Very nice architecture.
[31:36.85]The devs took a long time making this.
[31:39.57]You can tell.
[31:42.19]You can tell.
[31:42.57]Just look at this.
[31:43.75]Look at that guy's face.
[31:47.15]Well, I'm going to go up.
[31:51.95]I spoiled the surprise.
[31:53.51]Well, it's in every review.
[31:56.77]Every single review talked about the actual video game.
[32:00.17]Nobody wants to talk about the tutorial.
[32:05.67]Okay, well this leads, I'm sure it leads back up.
[32:07.51]There was another way I could go.
[32:09.21]Hopefully there's like a button I can press or something.
[32:14.10]Reading reviews.
[32:16.80]I mean, I've read like some Steam reviews.
[32:19.18]I've read some actual publication reviews.
[32:22.42]I want to be an informed gamer.
[32:27.48]Now, do I like trust half these review sites?
[32:30.59]Not as fucking far as I can throw them.
[32:32.25]You know what I mean?
[32:34.36]Do I trust any of these review sites?
[32:35.68]Not with a 10-foot pole.
[32:40.13]Do I trust any of them?
[32:43.95]No.
[32:53.94]You can throw websites?
[32:55.07]I don't know.
[33:03.45]Shit the promise just wait just hold on a minute Joke Steam reviews are more reliable.
[33:13.33]It's like funny because that that's kind of true because what do they got to lose?
[33:18.09]What does like what does a joke Steam reviewer have to lose?
[33:22.75]They're gonna tell you they're gonna stick in a make up some fucking crazy story about the game they played Steam reviews They don't know a giant publications might lose like sponsorships and like ad deals and shit.
[33:32.07]They got a lot to lose.
[33:32.81]I
[33:43.77]Have I gone in a circle?
[33:45.81]By the way.
[33:50.72]Why wasn't the door just open?
[33:53.40]Why don't you just put the button, like, right there?
[33:56.60]None of this is gameplay.
[33:58.00]None of this is action.
[33:59.20]None of this is the fucking game.
[34:01.24]Why does it matter, like, where you go find the power source?
[34:04.05]Just turn the fucking door on.
[34:09.51]There's no reason for this to exist.
[34:16.16]The door is powered by yelling.
[34:21.33]This is where I walked in, isn't it?
[34:23.11]Is it?
[34:24.93]Yeah, I think it is.
[34:25.65]The doors aren't electrified.
[34:34.92]Did I come all the way back?
[34:37.58]Why can't I run faster?
[34:43.29]Why is this in the game?
[34:44.63]Why?
[34:45.29]Let's be real.
[34:46.27]Be real with me.
[34:47.15]Chat, reviewers, Steam reviewers, future Steam reviewers.
[34:50.93]Why is this in the game?
[34:53.23]I understand like the walking down to the door.
[34:54.77]This is just the walk and listen to a guy talk to you.
[34:58.71]Why do I have to go find it in a fucking maze?
[35:00.76]Just open the door.
[35:01.60]Open the door.
[35:02.30]Have the door open.
[35:04.02]What's the point of this?
[35:05.70]There's no point.
[35:08.74]This entire beginning could have been summed up in like six minutes.
[35:16.42]It's to pad the game length.
[35:17.94]Is that what it is?
[35:23.78]Look, I would understand if there was like a puzzle here.
[35:25.85]If something was happening.
[35:27.25]No, no, no.
[35:27.61]This is just walk around and listen to the cutscene dialog.
[35:31.07]Just let it play out.
[35:32.37]And let me fucking open the door.
[35:39.38]It's maybe to map how you play.
[35:41.52]I swear to God, if I come across the first enemy and it just walks around in a basement, I'm gonna laugh.
[36:00.27]Anyone home?
[36:00.51]You literally went to the beginning without checking the area with the door.
[36:04.73]Just opened the door.
[36:05.87]Oh, you need to go get a power source.
[36:10.42]Go to the other place and find a power source.
[36:17.82]Oh, look, remember when you looked in the mirror over here?
[36:19.82]Yes, you do.
[36:22.04]Please play the game for an hour before you play the game.
[36:24.92]Remember this?
[36:38.79]Look at it.
[36:39.11]There's the door.
[36:41.75]Shoot the mirror.
[36:42.35]I would.
[36:43.51]He turned my gun off.
[36:50.39]Okay.
[36:50.73]Well, here we are.
[36:55.70]But my atmosphere... Atmosphere is not walking down a hallway.
[37:04.62]I'm sorry, guys.
[37:05.36]That's just not the way it is.
[37:06.34]The AI is gonna be so fucked up.
[37:20.43]Okay, I found another place.
[37:21.63]Oh.
[37:25.01]Should I not have done that?
[37:27.17]Should I not have done that?
[37:27.95]I don't know if I should have done that or not.
[37:32.54]Okay, good.
[37:32.92]It's saved.
[37:33.26]Yeah.
[37:38.90]It's also how you tune a piano.
[37:53.29]What am I decrypting?
[37:58.52]Alright, let me play the Futurama theme song.
[38:09.42]Is that the power source?
[38:10.42]Alright.
[38:17.17]Oh, thank you for turning on the power.
[38:18.51]You've tuned my piano.
[38:27.60]You need to decrypt my guitar.
[38:30.40]It has been out of tune since 2006.
[38:31.66]What is that?
[38:36.41]This is weird.
[38:42.63]What is this thing?
[38:44.55]Nothing, apparently.
[38:51.90]Oh, I gotta, like, yell into the fork, don't I?
[38:53.78]Oh, goddammit.
[38:55.70]Hold on.
[38:57.21]Let me scream into the fork.
[39:04.06]Is this what you have to do?
[39:04.78]No!
[39:07.52]No!
[39:07.62]Oh, fuck!
[39:07.88]Have I seriously misjudged what this game was?
[39:25.18]I think they're pieces of a puzzle.
[39:27.36]No shit.
[39:30.82]Oh, okay.
[39:31.74]Well, let's turn on that power source.
[39:36.72]Scream at the fucking fork.
[39:39.30]Is there a fork over here?
[39:40.66]No.
[39:45.06]There's another one.
[39:46.34]Okay.
[39:51.01]No, that's the first one.
[39:53.76]I probably just have to touch three of them or something.
[39:56.12]Where's the other one?
[39:56.76]What is this?
[39:57.72]Oh.
[40:05.34]Does that mean anything?
[40:10.34]That thing that keeps popping up on the screen, does that mean something?
[40:17.62]I'm not sure it does, but there are stairs over there.
[40:30.32]Is there another one right there?
[40:42.16]This is a very large palace.
[40:44.22]It is.
[40:49.73]Does this game get funny?
[40:51.05]I hope so.
[40:53.11]What do you mean this door is different?
[41:02.70]Okay.
[41:04.20]I guess I'm just... I guess we're going down.
[41:12.90]Um... Do I have to fucking touch it and sing into it, or what?
[41:21.14]Hello?
[41:33.52]No, this door is different.
[41:34.42]Okay.
[41:38.87]Don't touch it.
[41:39.69]Alright.
[41:45.67]I'll just keep... Yes, it is!
[41:48.24]It is.
[41:50.20]I'm glad the game is fucking self-aware.
[41:52.56]And why am I walking now?
[41:53.64]Like, run.
[41:54.08]Just because you're talking doesn't mean you have to fucking stop running.
[41:59.55]I'm going to start running again in five seconds.
[42:21.62]The long dialog hallway now you can run good thing we got done with that conversation through our cutscene hallway Alright, I'm gonna tell you right now
[42:50.65]Regardless of how good this actual game is, you got two letter grades drop down.
[42:56.77]Even if you get this thing to S ranking, like let's say this is an S game.
[43:02.71]It's a B. I hate when people do this shit.
[43:05.67]I hate when this happens.
[43:09.21]I do.
[43:12.95]If this is like a great game in like 30 minutes, why would you hide it behind your expensive voice actor?
[43:20.76]Give me a break.
[43:21.24]Oh, look.
[43:29.03]There it is.
[43:30.29]These, I know.
[43:32.47]We had rings exactly like them in the gardens.
[43:35.27]The soup detects a small gravity charge inside the scepter.
[43:38.37]Give it to me.
[43:38.71]Perhaps it can power the big door.
[43:40.73]The pedestal looks like the activation mechanism.
[43:44.45]before because of the lower no stop no don't start walking why am I walking step inside and feel wealthy not quite the rings spin up and the challenge is to get out in one piece
[44:13.10]That's just the thing from Thirteen Ghosts.
[44:20.94]I'm disabling your legs so I can talk to you.
[44:22.88]Wait, hold on.
[44:23.48]What?
[44:41.70]Where's the cutscene hallway?
[44:44.12]Did I fucking pass it or something?
[44:45.80]Oh my god.
[44:48.14]I'm like... Where's the dialog hallway?
[45:17.35]Am I going the right way right now?
[45:20.25]I don't even know.
[45:23.49]I have become so catastrophically bored that I forget like where to go.
[45:33.90]This is catastrophically boring.
[45:38.58]Like you nuked your own video game.
[45:43.07]Do it do it pin it to my fucking HUD Took you this long to give me like a fucking HUD and I got You guys tell me to jump down fuck me I gotta go like a route You dropped a nuke on your own game
[46:12.83]You may have made a good video game and then somebody nuked the game.
[46:26.74]That's like making a full delicious dinner and then going down to your kitty's cat box and what the fuck?
[46:44.97]I was gonna say something about grabbing a handful of dirty cat litter and sprinkling it on your fucking baked salmon.
[46:58.90]By the way, I don't know if you noticed that there were no other exits from this pit than the big door.
[47:05.38]How I hope the scepter will magically make it open.
[47:08.40]It will what?
[47:09.26]Must be nice always feeling that the world will act in your favor.
[47:13.15]But, guys, games are art, guys.
[47:15.95]That's the excuse.
[47:17.04]And that excuse does work.
[47:25.58]Alright, you could've... Could've just had this be the beginning of the game.
[47:30.25]You could've just had this be what happens when I walk into the fucking door.
[47:32.75]What?
[47:34.01]What?
[47:42.86]Don't tell me I have to do something else.
[47:44.20]What Gramps did to hundreds of resourcefuls for this?
[47:51.76]No, this is a cut.
[47:52.40]It's going to happen.
[47:53.08]I saw it the day I came to you.
[47:56.32]This subject lies down on a marble surface with a strange silver thumb.
[48:02.80]And the silver unfolds, pierces the skin, and slithers inside.
[48:07.33]In about half an hour, it consumes everything.
[48:13.23]The game is gonna be great.
[48:14.75]I can't wait to play it.
[48:35.48]I can't wait to play this fucking fantastic game that I keep hearing about.
[48:39.49]You killed him.
[48:46.07]What?
[48:46.25]You do?
[48:46.53]That sounds like somebody with a problem.
[48:49.01]I'm in the casino five days a week, remember?
[48:52.04]I'm good at chances.
[49:16.94]That's like the most biggest gambler's fallacy I've ever heard in my life.
[49:20.65]No, if I sit at the slot machine for like fucking four hours, I'm gonna win big.
[49:23.95]You're gonna lose four hours worth of money.
[49:37.26]Do you see that?
[49:41.25]Yeah, I see it.
[49:43.53]Yeah, this is cute.
[49:46.33]This is cute.
[49:51.17]Where am I supposed to go?
[49:55.67]I don't know.
[49:57.10]Let's check out over here.
[49:58.14]Why not?
[50:03.06]There's a mirror right there.
[50:04.06]It has to be.
[50:11.16]But this is not a mirror, this is as long as this is?
[50:16.22]So don't walk!
[50:17.66]If it's that long, why would you stop to walk?
[50:21.54]It's the Super Mario stairs.
[50:22.44]No, no, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[50:24.78]I don't think I'm supposed to be going this way.
[50:38.60]This is the Mario Stairs, right?
[50:39.88]I'm gonna turn around and it's gonna be like... Oh, fuck.
[50:46.20]Oh, wait.
[50:46.62]No, I'm not supposed to be here.
[50:54.87]At this point, it's a lost cause.
[50:56.33]I have to keep going.
[51:06.51]I'm giving myself even more of a chore to walk.
[51:16.63]This is not what I was supposed to do, is it?
[51:19.21]What about over here?
[51:20.21]That's like a door.
[51:25.81]The game is just tormenting me.
[51:28.63]It just knows.
[51:29.49]There's a giant fucking hallway.
[51:33.16]Am I even getting anywhere?
[51:34.31]I don't know.
[51:39.47]Is it just a giant loop?
[51:44.48]It's a looping hallway.
[51:55.95]It actually did.
[51:57.47]Okay, let's actually go this way then.
[52:01.15]Wait, I'm not looping?
[52:02.03]What are you talking about?
[52:02.75]I'm getting a little loopy.
[52:04.13]I'm not sure if I'm looping.
[52:06.91]Oh, I'm gonna sneeze.
[52:09.99]Hey, you guys ready for like the most action you've seen all stream for like an hour?
[52:13.57]Here it comes.
[52:16.67]Nope, the game doesn't even want me to sneeze to give you some action.
[52:20.10]Should I drop down?
[52:29.39]I don't know if I should have done this.
[52:33.42]Should I just drop down again?
[52:34.56]Thank you.
[52:35.26]Oh, it's close.
[52:35.76]It's only like 300 miles away.
[52:36.96]We're giants in this game.
[52:38.20]It's one step per mile.
[53:05.75]Please go all the way across the whole entire zone.
[53:08.38]Now, please stop.
[53:09.26]Stop.
[53:09.48]Let me talk for a minute.
[53:12.37]This place is...
[53:14.09]200 fucking meters to go.
[53:15.73]Slow down.
[53:18.23]I wish you'd stop calling me resourceful.
[53:20.49]It's what you are.
[53:21.61]I had the training, but I never bought into Gramps' vision.
[53:24.95]I never wanted any of this.
[53:27.17]Yet here you are.
[53:28.43]I was six the first time I met you.
[53:30.75]That way?
[53:31.11]I hiked for weeks to see what was beyond the gardens.
[53:35.71]When I finally reached the wall, Gramps was there waiting for me.
[53:43.06]Is there a way to get over there?
[53:44.54]You're losing me.
[53:45.28]Oh, you're losing me.
[54:11.18]There was another game that came out recently that did this.
[54:14.76]But it was, like, crazy.
[54:16.06]And a bunch of crazy shit happened.
[54:17.92]Hellblade, right?
[54:19.22]So I went back with him to follow the training, figuring I'd need it to get away.
[54:24.14]And I was good.
[54:27.50]He called me his prize.
[54:29.92]Oh, boy.
[54:30.50]Before the turn, I ran just shy of 15.
[54:33.80]I've been out for seven years now.
[54:38.14]Dear diary You can't just put all this on like a piece of paper you can pick up like a document like in Resident Evil And this is not even the right way is it no I got to drop down again
[55:10.74]You know like Resident Evil?
[55:12.20]They got a story to tell.
[55:13.80]And even games that have a story to tell.
[55:16.14]Like right there.
[55:16.84]There's a piece of paper.
[55:17.44]It's like a document.
[55:18.60]And you pick it up.
[55:20.37]And it's got a fucking... It's got ten paragraphs.
[55:23.59]You know what I do?
[55:24.95]Maybe I'll read it if I care.
[55:26.43]Maybe I'll check it out.
[55:28.35]I skipped it.
[55:29.23]Okay, now if I want to read it, I can.
[55:32.59]Give me lore.
[55:33.21]Give me like world details.
[55:34.69]You don't gotta speak it to me.
[55:36.23]This ain't an audio book.
[55:37.93]Maybe it is.
[55:55.48]I gotta sit on the Iron Throne.
[56:02.12]I just solved the puzzle.
[56:03.76]You know, it's funny.
[56:04.28]If I didn't actually walk over to this, I would've been here for like 10 minutes.
[56:17.23]Alright, give me the game.
[56:17.87]Dude, everybody is bustling about this game right now.
[56:24.01]People are just chomping at the bit to talk about this game.
[56:27.57]I gotta, I need to know.
[56:28.75]I need, I gotta, we gotta get there.
[56:30.09]No next.
[56:30.51]We're gonna go ascend.
[56:39.40]Don't play walking simulators?
[56:40.66]This is not a walking simulator.
[56:42.78]Not even close.
[56:45.08]This is like a fucking action shooting stealth kind of game.
[56:49.09]It's not a fucking walking simulator by any stretch of the, at all.
[56:55.42]Not even close.
[56:57.17]They just made it a walking simulator for the first hour of the game.
[56:59.59]For some reason.
[57:11.61]That face.
[57:12.21]And here comes...
[57:25.85]Here comes the game.
[57:26.41]Alright, now it's gonna teach me how to, like, run and shoot.
[57:47.07]Now the game begins.
[57:48.25]I'm ready to play the game.
[57:53.01]No.
[57:56.07]You're actually in New York.
[58:01.33]Touch the cube.
[58:04.17]And turn evil.
[58:14.87]So bad.
[58:15.43]What?
[58:15.75]Come on.
[58:16.17]That was like a shitty dad joke.
[58:17.86]I wasn't actually saying that.
[58:22.94]Alright, here we go.
[58:24.04]I can run on my own, right?
[58:27.18]Book.
[58:27.28]Book it.
[58:27.58]No, no, that's a 600 kilometers.
[58:30.02]You gotta walk 600 kilometers.
[58:31.32]It's so funny.
[58:32.02]600 kilometers.
[58:32.42]Let me tell you a fucking story while you walk.
[59:03.15]Alright.
[59:04.45]Hopefully this door opens.
[59:05.43]Nice.
[59:08.41]We'll get there, guys.
[59:10.03]Don't worry.
[59:10.49]It's coming up soon.
[59:11.67]Mm-hmm.
[59:34.57]You know, with a sense of urgency would be nice.
[59:40.13]You don't want to do like the shitty like 65-year-old lady Sunday jog.
[59:45.18]Okay.
[59:46.02]It turns into a skull.
[59:58.72]What?
[59:59.86]Knives come out?
[60:03.98]You can't make this easy for me, can you?
[60:08.01]The doors don't even open.
[60:10.07]The doors, they turn into skulls and they say, uh-uh.
[60:12.33]Oh my god.
[60:19.98]I told you it was a funhouse.
[60:26.98]Oh, here's a door.
[60:39.31]The AI that chases me around is gonna be stupid as fuck.
[60:42.35]They probably will be.
[60:45.79]Yeah, I don't even have, like, an HP bar.
[60:50.09]I have no health.
[60:50.98]I'm assuming the cube on the back is gonna be my health.
[60:55.42]Hey, yeah, we're one kilometer down.
[60:56.58]We only got 599 to go.
[61:00.28]Look, I don't want to talk like this.
[61:01.42]I don't want to say shit like this.
[61:05.72]But I speak my mind.
[61:09.07]Should I go down?
[61:09.59]Can I open?
[61:10.13]No.
[61:10.21]I guess we're just gonna drop.
[61:11.85]I guess so.
[61:12.09]Okay.
[61:12.23]That one ain't gonna open.
[61:40.89]I will not let me run faster.
[61:42.21]I know this game is going to be fun, that's the thing.
[61:44.26]I'm certain this game is going to be fun.
[61:46.50]I'm positive.
[61:47.10]I know it deep down in my heart.
[62:15.85]We're still dealing with the funhouse here.
[62:18.09]I don't even know what the hell that was trying to tell me.
[62:23.40]But I'm going to open them.
[62:25.28]I'm going to open this one too and see what's behind it.
[62:37.55]a series of fucking doors.
[62:39.77]Let's try... No, no.
[62:42.69]No!
[62:43.65]No, it's gonna be like a puzzle to figure out which one it is or something.
[62:46.92]No, it's not.
[62:47.44]They both led to the same place.
[62:48.78]Mm-hmm.
[62:56.00]And here's another cutscene.
[63:07.76]Okay.
[63:07.92]We're almost there.
[63:08.54]We've only got 70 more cheese triangles.
[63:10.42]Almost.
[63:36.87]No, the lights, the lights.
[63:39.52]The lights.
[63:41.34]There they go again.
[63:43.08]What happened?
[63:44.38]It seems... Another discharge.
[63:51.67]Breathe air.
[63:53.19]There's air now.
[63:55.51]How is that possible?
[63:56.89]I don't know.
[63:58.79]The chemical composition of the environment was altered in the blink of an eye.
[64:03.64]That must have been what the energy buildup was for.
[64:09.57]Okay, this is the game.
[64:10.52]This is where the game starts.
[64:11.68]I know that for... I'm positive.
[64:13.32]Because when the lights turn off, it like doesn't... When the lights just... I don't know, okay?
[64:18.02]I'm trying... I'm reaching for stars here.
[64:21.58]What?
[64:21.72]250?
[64:21.88]It's just holding a carrot in front of my face.
[64:27.43]What's with the fucking carrot on a stick?
[64:39.79]Oh no, here go the lights!
[64:49.08]Okay, where's me?
[64:50.92]This is where it starts to record everything you're doing.
[64:53.60]When the lights are on... I don't know, it's a burnt bird.
[65:00.52]This is from what I've gathered with my research.
[65:03.05]When the lights are on, it records you.
[65:06.33]When the lights are off, it resets it.
[65:09.67]But why is it doing it now?
[65:12.49]It's doing it in a very odd manner.
[65:17.93]It's making me feel like I'm dying and respawning me.
[65:21.01]A lot of like burnt dead birds.
[65:22.71]Okay.
[65:39.26]Uh-oh.
[65:42.90]Yeah, these are all me.
[65:43.86]This.
[65:44.08]Yeah, these are all going to turn into me.
[65:55.51]Yeah, I can already tell.
[65:56.51]No, this is cool.
[65:57.41]Cool.
[65:58.33]I like it.
[65:58.83]This is cool.
[66:01.13]You could have started with this.
[66:07.05]Like, imagine if, like, we had an opening cutscene, and then we got, like, a little bit of storyline, and then, like, five, ten minutes, then we got here.
[66:15.65]Could've started with this.
[66:17.00]Could've opened with this.
[66:23.56]Because this is cool.
[66:29.03]It started with the ending.
[66:30.57]No, this game is good.
[66:31.45]I'm positive.
[66:31.87]Yep, they're all going to be people.
[66:33.14]It's going to be cool and they're all going to mimic me and I'm going to get stuck.
[66:36.84]And here go the lights again.
[66:56.25]It's just like Clue.
[66:57.36]It's going to turn on one time and I'm going to be on the ground dead.
[67:00.68]There it is.
[67:01.10]Well.
[67:01.26]Targeted.
[67:02.54]Not by much.
[67:18.92]The sphere activates if life forms are detected.
[67:21.94]Lighting up in the direction of the readings.
[67:23.66]The size of the marker reflects the approximate visual silhouette of the life form.
[67:28.82]The color changes from neutral blue.
[67:30.02]The suit perceives the life form as a threat.
[67:32.58]Yellow, you're in the enemy's line of sight.
[67:34.18]If you stay here, you'll be discovered.
[67:35.40]Red, you are hunted.
[67:36.52]If you are hunted but hidden, the enemy will be... See?
[67:38.50]I told you this is a fucking video game.
[67:42.63]This is a video... This is a video game.
[67:49.68]And it's all based off of you.
[67:53.34]You know, like, the world ends with you.
[67:55.96]Remember that Nintendo DS game?
[67:59.46]Another 250 meters to go.
[68:06.82]Where are they?
[68:07.60]Okay, good.
[68:09.88]Here we go.
[68:11.24]Good.
[68:16.06]Come on, come and get me.
[68:17.54]Come and get me, me.
[68:21.38]Does it hurt?
[68:21.98]Can I take damage?
[68:24.96]I don't think I can yet.
[68:26.52]No.
[68:33.03]Uh-oh.
[68:35.15]Oh, shit.
[68:36.09]Alright, this is where they're going to be able to move, and I'm going to have to run.
[68:43.73]No.
[68:44.65]Uh...
[68:47.63]Nice comedy hallway, yeah?
[68:49.17]Let's keep going and then they eventually they're all gonna look like me that's gonna be the big twist.
[68:54.95]Scare Thursdays.
[69:19.19]We're so close.
[69:23.91]See?
[69:24.33]This kinda looks like me if I was a Borg.
[69:26.55]What does it want me to do?
[69:30.80]What letter is that?
[69:40.07]Press F to not die You were hurt Hurt
[70:06.76]Getting hurt triggers the suit's restorative support system.
[70:10.80]This is shown in the HUD as a pulsating red sphere of spikes.
[70:13.72]While the sphere is visible, it means that you are in a critical state, and you will die if anything else touches you.
[70:19.36]You fucking firework.
[70:24.47]I wish I could move faster, though.
[70:30.49]Good thing they're, like, slow enough where it doesn't matter.
[70:36.16]They're just like slug people still.
[70:40.29]Hey.
[70:43.17]There's three things over there.
[70:44.43]How do I get out of here?
[70:47.27]Was there another... What?
[70:52.18]No, I can't even...
[70:56.72]Yeah, that entire first section was only there for them to tell a gigantic story while you walk around.
[71:04.56]Push F to push.
[71:06.18]Tap F. Oh, okay.
[71:14.73]So I guess you have to tap F. Well, that didn't work that time.
[71:22.53]I'm critically injured because some guy grabbed my arm.
[71:26.62]Charge the fucking suit.
[71:32.76]Whole lot of random gyroscopes around my body.
[71:36.44]Oh.
[71:38.62]Thanks.
[71:39.08]Wait, what?
[71:40.71]Kill as many as I can line up.
[71:55.06]I got one guy in the very back.
[72:00.66]Why would I shoot the gun?
[72:03.40]Oh, that's why.
[72:07.76]Charging.
[72:08.94]What the fuck?
[72:18.43]It's a two-cell jump.
[72:19.93]You need more energy.
[72:29.39]Thanks for the gun.
[72:30.26]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[72:33.16]Kill as many as you can line up.
[72:39.84]There we are.
[72:40.49]Gotta charge it again.
[72:46.17]Give me some more cell juice.
[72:57.11]Okay.
[72:58.01]That was fun.
[73:01.41]Stop and refund.
[73:02.29]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[73:03.90]We're not refunding.
[73:08.30]We're not going to refund.
[73:09.40]God damn it.
[73:17.88]Hey.
[73:27.90]Maybe I should have done that.
[73:28.68]Oh, fuck.
[73:32.66]Get off me.
[73:36.58]It's charging.
[73:37.35]Just... Come on, come on.
[73:46.69]Come on, you know what to do.
[73:48.07]You know what to do.
[73:49.61]Just line it up.
[73:51.60]Oh, shit.
[73:52.30]Shit.
[74:03.78]Oh my god.
[74:04.88]Oh, dear fucking lord in heaven.
[74:06.42]I need to charge the fucking gun.
[74:38.12]Didn't even get the guy behind him.
[74:42.26]I need a bigger battery.
[74:50.14]I know I don't have to shoot them in the head, but it's FPS coming back and biting me.
[74:57.07]Alright, sure.
[74:58.41]Charge up.
[74:59.35]Turn around.
[75:01.13]Because this happens again.
[75:02.21]They're getting up.
[75:10.60]I've died twice here.
[75:11.42]Yeah, I've died twice here because this is the first time I've been able to pl- I haven't been able to play a video game for an hour.
[75:17.08]You understand?
[75:17.50]Like, this is the first- this is the first time I've been able to play a video game.
[75:22.84]I'm just been walking around.
[75:25.53]The palace resurrected them.
[75:27.03]Who knows what this death trap is capable of.
[75:29.81]My guess is things will only get worse.
[75:32.21]You really need to work on your motivational skills.
[75:41.07]Shooting.
[75:41.39]I did that on purpose.
[75:43.91]Okay.
[75:44.05]Okay.
[75:44.17]So I can only push if I have a blue bar.
[76:10.30]So how do I sprint?
[76:17.04]Some action there.
[76:17.66]Okay.
[76:24.26]Open.
[76:28.73]Another... God damn.
[76:37.79]I don't know if I want to go in there.
[76:52.02]Oh, no.
[76:53.13]When behind an enemy, hold F. It's all about the F, huh?
[77:01.47]Okay.
[77:03.01]There's the stealth mechanic.
[77:06.90]Dude, my friends...
[77:10.29]I've been streaming for almost an hour and 20 minutes.
[77:12.29]And it just told us... How to do a stealth takedown.
[77:17.29]Like... Yeah, I... I get it.
[77:20.69]I understand.
[77:21.73]But... No, there's an area scan.
[77:23.93]What?
[77:24.03]The light just turned off.
[77:38.65]What?
[77:38.81]I was in the middle of choking someone.
[77:43.33]Oh, shit.
[77:45.00]Wait a minute.
[77:46.20]Okay, I understand now.
[77:47.36]It's happening.
[77:48.52]I'm gonna come down this hallway.
[77:52.12]Watch this.
[77:56.35]Maybe not.
[78:06.71]I guess not.
[78:07.47]I thought that was... Shouting.
[78:15.29]Oh, this is how you hold R. Wait.
[78:17.88]Hey, girls.
[78:21.80]Hey, girls.
[78:22.76]Hey, over here.
[78:24.50]Over here.
[78:25.40]What am I doing?
[78:25.96]That's not a smart decision.
[78:34.52]Okay, that's the crouch.
[78:37.00]Don't matter though, I'll just go.
[78:41.35]Let's vault over this and get the hell out of here.
[78:43.17]Riot function.
[78:50.21]Middle mouse button.
[79:04.47]Wide gauge aim with right upper and fire middle mouse button.
[79:09.00]4 meters, 180 degrees.
[79:11.08]Knock over anyone within 4 meters.
[79:13.20]Alright.
[79:13.54]And it's very loud.
[79:18.82]Wait.
[79:19.31]Did I just do that to myself?
[79:20.63]I don't know.
[79:26.29]Let's try it.
[79:26.75]Let's give it a try.
[79:39.32]No, it's just like a pulse.
[79:52.07]Is this Dead Rising?
[79:53.24]No.
[79:53.76]This is, uh... This is not Dead Rising.
[80:03.19]Keep going.
[80:05.51]Oh, yeah.
[80:07.61]We're sure having a blast here.
[80:21.78]Going down.
[80:23.40]Right in the fucking skull.
[80:27.07]Wait.
[80:28.69]Okay.
[80:31.53]Okay.
[80:35.34]Sprint?
[80:35.84]No.
[80:36.10]Holding down shift makes me walk.
[80:46.41]The light's off.
[80:49.09]Well, maybe not.
[80:51.01]The lights are still on.
[80:58.84]Um... Alright.
[81:02.12]Alright.
[81:04.98]Recharge the suit.
[81:06.32]Keep going.
[81:09.14]I'm sure you're gonna need to know how to sprint.
[81:11.04]Yeah, I know, right?
[81:11.82]So what is it?
[81:12.50]No, that's scream.
[81:13.80]That's not... That's scream.
[81:16.90]Q is that other thing.
[81:23.07]Shift is walk.
[81:45.85]Is it alt?
[81:46.93]I don't think so.
[81:52.63]Can I go down there?
[81:53.43]I don't know.
[81:57.24]I'm not sure.
[82:01.94]No, I can't drop down there.
[82:05.24]Just pull them all and then just run around the circle.
[82:07.01]I think it matters.
[82:13.36]Yep, just push this person and then run.
[82:22.19]This music is a little, uh... A little all over the place, by the way.
[82:35.08]I feel like I'm playing Tetris.
[82:37.24]Oh, shit.
[82:43.94]No!
[82:44.30]Fuck, what?
[82:44.64]I didn't have enough energy?
[82:46.54]No, don't lose it here.
[82:47.38]Don't!
[82:48.03]Do not!
[82:48.55]Oh, my fucking god.
[82:54.59]Oh, my fucking god.
[82:56.75]Oh, god.
[82:57.73]This hurts.
[83:05.24]What is this?
[83:13.32]Run past?
[83:13.92]I would love to fucking know how to sprint.
[83:17.58]How do you sprint?
[83:18.36]I'm gonna press fucking every- I'm gonna go into the controls menu.
[83:26.95]What is it?
[83:38.11]It doesn't exist.
[83:51.09]Didn't even get that guy.
[83:52.07]You gotta be shitting me.
[83:59.56]There's a sprint, but I can't do it yet.
[84:05.16]Yeah, yeah.
[84:05.76]It's time to start fucking killing people.
[84:09.58]You know what I mean?
[84:10.98]No, not over here.
[84:11.74]Why did I press reload?
[84:16.91]I'm trying to, like, reload.
[84:21.06]Just causing myself problems.
[84:24.02]Nah, I gotta line this up.
[84:34.83]Really?
[84:35.11]Like, are you kidding me?
[84:49.55]I do like how there's a create problems for yourself button.
[84:53.59]That's true.
[84:59.80]Got ya.
[85:06.56]What was the point of this?
[85:07.26]I have no idea.
[85:16.40]Yeah, record that one and come get me.
[85:27.36]That's what it's gonna do.
[85:37.07]That enemy is gonna be real fucking dumb.
[85:49.08]It's learning.
[85:51.96]What else do you want to learn, huh?
[85:54.94]I'm gonna make them so dumb.
[85:59.78]Oh no, they can slide over ledges.
[86:02.58]Whatever will we do?
[86:08.63]What's this thing?
[86:11.81]Touch it.
[86:12.43]The matter is strengthening your suit's ability to retain energy from your surroundings.
[86:20.12]Cell energy.
[86:21.02]Yeah, yeah.
[86:21.46]Found in the palace is a crystalline resource strangely perfect for increasing the suit's cell capacity.
[86:26.79]When you've picked up six crystals, you get one additional cell slot.
[86:29.91]The number displayed in the cell meter shows the remaining number of crystals.
[86:33.73]Uh-huh.
[86:37.15]Okay.
[86:41.47]I'm actually kind of getting scared that I'm going to get followed.
[86:43.39]Alright.
[86:45.35]I'm going to shoot the person right in the fucking head.
[86:51.18]Oh look, you don't have to sit down too.
[86:59.99]What?
[87:00.11]I'm gonna blow the door open or something.
[87:02.51]Sprinting, hold space.
[87:18.46]Oh, that's so much better.
[87:19.54]I finally can move.
[87:30.95]Yeah, now it knows how to sprint.
[87:32.79]That's fine.
[87:33.41]It uses the same stamina bar.
[87:35.57]Hey, remember this.
[87:47.26]It's learning to speak.
[87:48.52]Yeah, I want to make sure I know where it is at all times.
[87:53.08]I don't know.
[87:55.46]At least I'll know where she is.
[87:56.38]counting down?
[88:18.09]Sprinting!
[88:18.57]Alright, let me in.
[88:23.08]I don't know what it's trying to do here.
[88:24.14]Alright.
[88:35.73]Uh... Sure.
[88:43.27]Let's choke this guy out.
[88:46.32]You're dead.
[88:48.92]Um, I guess I can't, like, open this.
[88:50.66]I have to keep going, apparently.
[88:53.84]To where I'm not sure.
[88:54.62]Do I have to touch all the things?
[89:03.74]I'm teaching it how to choke.
[89:07.86]Well, whatever.
[89:08.42]Like, how am I supposed to kill people?
[89:13.02]I gotta touch all the blue things.
[89:25.58]Alright.
[89:28.92]Give me that.
[89:29.38]Push.
[89:35.25]Nothing else I can do, right?
[89:36.05]Just gonna touch all the blue things.
[89:40.81]I'm gonna shit my pants when I see me walk up these stairs.
[89:49.74]Teach it how to be an internet comedian?
[89:53.14]I can have it easy.
[89:57.94]Now they can kick.
[90:00.88]Yeah, don't worry, guys.
[90:01.58]The AI has been lost for like 30 minutes already.
[90:06.93]Oh, my fucking God.
[90:10.25]You tell me I have to go touch all of these?
[90:14.75]Oh, that's a pain in the ass.
[90:23.07]Yeah, right now, my AI counterpart is walking around in the tutorial of the first part of the game.
[90:32.98]It has no idea where the hell it's going.
[90:35.66]Why should I be concerned?
[90:36.50]It's me.
[90:36.94]Do you think I'm going to actually be... Is that me?
[90:47.43]The AI is going through the intro.
[90:50.77]I know, it really is.
[90:54.96]I'm actually kind of scared.
[90:59.84]What was that?
[91:07.87]You see, I play so stupidly in stuff like this that I'm gonna catch myself off guard.
[91:15.05]But why does this keep happening?
[91:18.08]Where am I?
[91:22.77]Where's my bad guy version of me?
[91:31.81]I missed an orb?
[91:32.69]Oh, fucking god damn it.
[91:36.62]I actually did.
[91:38.14]Only four more to go.
[91:48.72]Let me sprint by this fucking idiot.
[91:55.95]Don't worry, the AI is going to be so dumb.
[91:57.87]It's going to be fine.
[91:59.01]I am in absolutely no danger.
[92:07.96]Okay, turn the lights off.
[92:22.11]That works.
[92:31.99]Get out of the way.
[92:35.58]Last one.
[92:40.08]One of these is going to turn into me.
[92:41.58]I would assume.
[92:42.60]I don't know.
[92:46.41]Shouldn't I be watching me coming down the hallway, like, fucking shooting people and punching people and stuff?
[92:51.73]It's up there.
[92:54.27]God damn it.
[92:58.74]They all are me.
[93:00.28]Why aren't they doing anything?
[93:03.34]Can I climb this?
[93:05.22]Of course not.
[93:13.26]He still doesn't get it.
[93:15.84]I'm supposed to get it, but... Why have none of them come after me?
[93:31.16]Alright, let's go.
[93:35.44]They need to fully evolve.
[93:40.32]Here we go.
[93:46.28]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[93:47.64]Go on in through the thing.
[93:50.39]You did it.
[93:52.63]Activate it.
[93:53.57]Activate it by saying, hey.
[94:01.65]And they're all me.
[94:15.19]Paperback brought to you by, from the seed, from the spring, the voice of eternity.
[94:22.05]For... forever, I'm... Alright, this is a shit phase.
[94:26.78]This is me trying to read a letter when I'm drunk.
[94:33.46]How long until they evolve past me?
[94:35.40]55 kilometers!
[94:36.44]Holy shit, that was a long train ride.
[94:50.83]They can't go in the water.
[94:56.64]Can I go in the water?
[94:59.12]I think it's a cold.
[95:00.16]Is the water cold?
[95:11.31]Okay, now they're all coming after me.
[95:13.73]They're all looking at me.
[95:15.11]Good for you.
[95:20.17]Alright, I'm safe.
[95:23.39]Anybody else around this corner?
[95:26.20]Don't think so.
[95:32.68]No, not over here, you idiot.
[95:42.41]Okay.
[95:43.59]Okay.
[95:48.32]I shouldn't teach them to go in the water then.
[95:49.80]They're gonna learn to go in the water if I go in the water, right?
[95:51.78]They're gonna know it's safe to go in the water.
[95:58.90]Maybe they don't yet.
[96:02.22]I have no idea.
[96:03.14]You gotta learn from the best.
[96:11.74]Learn from the best is what I say.
[96:18.69]Just shoot them if they step in the water.
[96:20.21]I'm not even sure where I'm supposed to be going.
[96:24.75]Oh, god damn it.
[96:26.47]God damn it, I went the wrong way.
[96:33.51]No, they're going to be in the water.
[96:37.20]They're all going to be sprinting after me in the water.
[96:40.26]Get as close to this door as I can.
[96:49.75]I'm expecting too much from this game.
[96:58.34]Okay.
[96:59.48]Yeah, they're going in the water now.
[97:05.34]Bye.
[97:08.34]Fuck outta here.
[97:10.34]You wanna learn?
[97:12.43]You wanna learn?
[97:16.57]That's the shove, buddy.
[97:19.45]Quick, pick up the telescope!
[97:22.47]Jeez!
[97:28.47]Where do I go?
[97:30.36]What am I supposed to do?
[97:33.30]What does it pick?
[97:33.96]Eat it?
[97:34.24]What am I eating?
[97:34.96]I just ate like a plastic plant.
[97:47.61]What the fuck?
[97:54.75]I got a better idea.
[97:59.58]You idiots aren't going to know how to sprint now, are you?
[98:05.46]Why go in the water again?
[98:06.42]Because there's no other way to go.
[98:16.15]God, fucking record it.
[98:18.60]Come on.
[98:19.42]Bring it on.
[98:24.44]Just stay down and everyone will be a moron.
[98:32.88]Teach me how to refund the game?
[98:34.60]No.
[98:38.08]I'm telling you, this is gonna work.
[98:41.15]Watch this.
[98:44.91]See?
[98:46.49]It worked.
[98:50.73]Maybe it didn't.
[98:51.93]But does it really matter?
[99:00.42]No, you shouldn't know how to move.
[99:01.57]You shouldn't know how to do this yet.
[99:08.29]Why would you vault over this?
[99:19.98]Went the same way that I did.
[99:26.16]No, shit!
[99:27.27]Stop trying to reload!
[99:29.45]Oh, God!
[99:33.40]Do they know how to sprint yet?
[99:38.95]Oh god damn it.
[99:43.29]They're doing it.
[99:45.05]I just gotta make it across the water.
[99:47.01]Am I still being followed?
[99:48.35]Oh shit, there's so many of them.
[99:49.90]Why are you not crouching?
[99:51.60]You guys should be crouching.
[99:54.88]Don't turn it off, fuck.
[100:03.12]Go!
[100:03.32]One of them has a gun!
[100:11.61]What is with this framerate?
[100:12.63]Alright, we're fine.
[100:20.75]Yeah, that guy has a gun now.
[100:23.21]So I'm not gonna shoot the gun.
[100:24.26]I can do this before I fucking have to do this again.
[100:36.16]I ain't doing that whole goddamn thing again.
[100:38.06]Who is that?
[100:38.52]Alright, good.
[100:47.10]Save it.
[100:47.80]Huh?
[100:51.24]Just... save the game.
[100:52.43]No one behind me, right?
[100:57.47]Is he opening the door?
[100:58.63]No.
[101:02.47]They're getting more capable after every blackout.
[101:07.13]The behavior is scripted?
[101:07.81]No.
[101:07.91]Don't play Skate 3.
[101:08.89]What?
[101:09.19]Everybody told me this game was like best game ever.
[101:40.58]I told you, I read all the reviews.
[101:42.80]Uh, well, okay.
[101:53.36]A joke review on Steam said this.
[101:55.34]I hope they can all see me, alright.
[101:59.65]That's fine.
[102:02.33]If I start eating grass, will they do the same thing?
[102:11.21]Is somebody behind me?
[102:12.81]Wait, hold on.
[102:15.83]Somebody grabbed me from behind.
[102:17.19]They were just double teaming me.
[102:21.60]Alright, but close that fucking door.
[102:29.98]Yeah, what if I just graze around and just eat stuff?
[102:37.81]Now what?
[102:38.69]Oh god.
[102:48.17]Is he running?
[102:49.15]That one is learning.
[102:49.97]That one's understanding what to do.
[102:52.59]That's okay.
[102:56.03]Coming to get me?
[102:57.17]You're learning?
[102:58.11]That's good?
[102:58.59]Remember, the master is the one that knows the real push.
[103:09.30]Get out of here.
[103:12.48]I had to do that.
[103:16.62]I'm teaching them how to open doors.
[103:18.06]Oh.
[103:28.51]Remember, they can open doors.
[103:30.09]Just remember that.
[103:37.13]How far did that go?
[103:37.81]I don't know.
[103:42.73]Nope, somebody's doing that to me now.
[103:46.10]Now you know where I am.
[103:52.83]Eat the plastic grapes.
[103:55.89]See?
[103:56.19]They're gonna do that too.
[103:57.69]Just make this be the only fucking thing they do.
[104:00.71]Maybe I can fuck with the game's AI to a point where it overrides everything else.
[104:10.74]Okay, that should be enough.
[104:23.73]There is no AI.
[104:32.17]That was really loud.
[104:34.33]That was too loud, in fact.
[104:42.77]Get up and sprint!
[104:45.19]I don't care.
[104:46.45]At this point, you know?
[104:47.60]Like, I don't care.
[104:48.56]Wait, wait, wait!
[104:56.77]God damn it.
[105:18.87]See if I give a fuck.
[105:31.06]I should have eaten some more grapes.
[105:33.68]You know, I actually really should have.
[105:40.41]Quickly, get down there.
[105:41.13]Go, go, go, go, go.
[105:43.37]Even if they sprint, it's okay.
[105:47.27]I'm going to pull a vault over this right when we come back from darkness.
[105:52.88]Nope, I can't do that.
[105:55.78]I just fucked myself.
[106:00.28]I just fucked myself in the face.
[106:44.12]Give us one more try.
[106:56.31]Yes, you can see me.
[106:57.03]That's fine.
[106:57.76]Just, like, hide and walk.
[107:01.66]Is this supposed to be scary?
[107:02.68]No.
[107:04.04]It was supposed to be good.
[107:06.00]I'm sorry.
[107:07.10]I'm sorry.
[107:07.54]That was uncalled for.
[107:35.62]I'm like I talked this game up so much too guys It's gonna be the best fucking game ever like the game like teacher you teach the game And they come after you it's crazy And he's at least nearly get out of here
[108:05.31]I'm going to get spotted by somebody.
[108:06.47]Somebody just found me.
[108:11.64]Yeah, I still don't understand what the point of the scream is.
[108:20.62]Well, now you see me.
[108:22.04]That's great.
[108:28.67]You don't know how to do that, do you?
[108:34.31]Without like a proper...
[108:42.19]Fuck off.
[108:45.77]Now it's getting dark again.
[108:49.95]Oh, come on.
[108:50.69]They all got me.
[109:16.88]This game's not even a stealth game.
[109:25.25]I hate this game.
[109:26.77]Why?
[109:27.11]This is supposed to be fun.
[109:28.41]I'm supposed to like this game.
[109:29.55]I was going into this.
[109:31.55]It was supposed to be like fun.
[109:33.25]And it was going to be like entertaining.
[109:34.91]No, it's just not for me.
[109:44.28]There you go.
[109:44.72]It's just not for me.
[109:47.25]You might think this is game of the year.
[109:54.31]This is not what I thought it was gonna be.
[109:56.24]I thought it was gonna be different.
[110:09.91]I'm just gonna sit here.
[110:22.54]Okay, at least they're acting like me.
[110:24.06]They're like walking, pacing back and forth in circles.
[110:30.10]They're gonna see where I am.
[110:32.62]Somebody just did that to me.
[110:35.93]There's nobody in here.
[110:37.35]There's a guy coming in here now.
[110:39.25]Is that the guy that found me?
[110:44.43]I don't know.
[110:44.77]Maybe.
[110:47.78]Have a grape.
[111:00.03]God damn it.
[111:00.67]He's just like gonna come in here and fuck this whole thing up So if if I don't go behind somebody right The push knocks them out for like a quarter of a second then they just get up and run after you If I shoot the gun it attracts the whole room
[111:29.65]They don't really have, like, a set path or anything.
[111:37.48]I don't think that's how you're supposed to do it.
[111:48.75]Be careful.
[111:52.03]Those look like set paths to me.
[111:53.21]Yeah, you know what?
[111:53.68]They do.
[111:56.80]They have literally only set paths.
[111:58.52]I thought that was supposed to be me.
[112:00.73]Like running as me.
[112:02.17]Doing me things.
[112:18.24]Get out the shotgun.
[112:19.84]I'm about to.
[112:24.54]This guy's coming back over here.
[112:31.17]I mean... I guess I can get this guy now, I think.
[112:36.71]Maybe I have to close the door?
[112:37.77]Are you smart enough to come searching for me over here?
[112:49.42]Really hope not.
[112:52.78]Are you?
[112:53.94]No, good.
[112:55.10]They're not intelligent enough to follow up on their search.
[113:07.08]And now it's fucking dark.
[113:11.89]Get it?
[113:13.61]Where am I going?
[113:14.15]I don't know.
[113:14.95]Who knows?
[113:24.92]Eat my words.
[113:32.71]I can't even, like... I can't even fucking alt-tab.
[113:39.74]Oh my god, guys.
[113:42.22]Why on Earth?
[113:44.13]Get me out of here.
[113:47.49]Hold on.
[113:51.19]That's not a bad game.
[113:52.07]Like, it's just... No, I'm not gonna refund it.
[113:54.17]It's just not what I thought it was.
[113:55.93]That is not what I thought it was.
[113:57.51]It's alright.
[113:58.27]It doesn't make it a bad game.
[114:00.12]It's just... I thought it was gonna be something else.
[114:02.78]It's not what it was.
[114:05.34]It's alright.
[114:06.06]It's gonna be fine.
[114:12.06]Am I gonna play it again?
[114:12.88]So...
[114:22.34]It's too smart for me.
[114:28.52]I thought it was going to be a good... No, no.
[114:30.16]I'm going to read the top review on Steam.
[114:33.89]Let me see what it says.
[114:35.51]We need to know, you know?
[114:39.19]Like, I... Okay.
[114:45.28]This is an original idea made into a unique gem.
[114:49.33]I'm going to read this to you.
[114:50.27]Let me put a different screen on.
[114:52.25]If you were coming here to see the gameplay for this game, I'm sorry.
[114:55.35]We're going to move on to something else.
[114:57.51]It's just not for me.
[114:58.69]I wanted to try it on stream.
[115:02.51]If you got to see what you wanted to see, thank you for sticking around.
[115:06.69]But it's a unique gem.
[115:10.17]I don't even care.
[115:18.48]So, here are the options.
[115:22.66]It probably does get a little bit better.
[115:23.96]It's just not what I thought it was going to be.
[115:27.15]It was something else entirely.
[115:28.87]It's okay, though.
[115:32.21]So, we can either do one of a few things.
[115:35.71]I'm going to put up a poll.
[115:36.83]Because I still want to stream for another couple hours.
[115:38.61]So, let's do... Sometimes you swing and you miss.
[115:44.23]As we are very well aware.
[115:47.05]I fucking, like, streamed this game for, like, two hours.
[115:50.71]And, like, almost all of it was, like, the walking around and listening to cutscenes.
[115:55.76]You know what I'm saying?
[115:59.22]It's okay.
[116:00.38]It's alright.
[116:02.70]Don't worry.
[116:06.06]Should we... I'm not gonna go back... We're not gonna do Demon's Souls tonight.
[116:11.69]I wanna move away from that for, like, at least one stream or two, you know?
[116:17.88]The entire chat told me... No, it... I thought it was... Fuck me.
[116:25.42]Okay.
[116:26.58]We can either play some Darkest Dungeon.
[116:31.02]I can continue playing that on stream.
[116:33.06]We can just chill.
[116:34.64]Darkest Dungeon.
[116:35.78]There's also... Let's see here.
[116:41.48]What else we got?
[116:42.00]Let me just put this screen up for a second.
[116:48.65]There is Darkest Dungeon.
[116:50.93]Play that for like an hour or two.
[116:55.61]What else is here?
[117:01.13]Like God Hand.
[117:02.03]I mean, I could just play like a dumb PlayStation 3 game that's not Demon's Souls.
[117:06.02]Alright, so here you go.
[117:08.10]Darkest Dungeon.
[117:12.14]We either stay PC or we'll do a stupid, shitty PlayStation 3 game.
[117:20.99]Because I get a shitload of those.
[117:25.45]We will go back to Demon's Souls after this weekend.
[117:31.29]So while that poll is there, I'm going to go take a piss.
[117:34.48]I'll be right back.
[117:36.52]Don't go anywhere.
[117:37.68]Unless, of course, you gotta go.
[117:40.00]But thank you for sticking around.
[117:43.32]Sorry it wasn't what we expected.
[117:46.24]At least me.
[117:47.62]I'll be right back and we'll see what we're going to do.
[117:51.64]BRB.
[118:46.17]Wait, what?
[121:04.32]It ain't my birthday yet.
[121:07.42]It's my birthday in like an hour and a half.
[121:10.74]Alright, so, um, what do we got?
[121:14.69]Alright, well, a thousand votes pretty much are for a PlayStation 3 game.
[121:22.66]Yeah.
[121:23.28]Well, sometimes you bust.
[121:24.22]It's okay.
[121:25.97]When you play Blackjack, those of you that are Blackjack players can attest to this.
[121:32.35]Sometimes you just, sometimes you bust.
[121:34.49]Sometimes you get Blackjack.
[121:35.65]It happens.
[121:38.13]Alright, so hopefully the stream does not have to turn off here.
[121:42.22]Because that's very possible because every time I try to cap my webcam or my Elgato, OBS likes to crash.
[121:53.44]So if that happens, I will be right back.
[121:54.84]It's going to take me like a minute to set it up.
[121:56.34]So give me a minute here.
[121:59.48]Give me just a smidge of a second.
[122:04.68]Hold on.
[122:06.66]Should I put on like elevator music or something?
[122:11.35]We're going to play Kung Fu Rider, by the way.
[122:15.03]If I can find it.
[122:18.19]It's like some shitty elevator music.
[122:25.51]That is not... This is not elevator music.
[122:28.25]It's a YouTube Red ad.
[122:31.95]YouTube Red is desperate for you to sign up for their awful service.
[122:37.17]I highly recommend that you don't do it though, because it's a piece of absolute fucking garbage.
[122:41.85]As is that website now.
[122:43.49]If you're curious, if you don't know, the entire second channel was recently deemed as not advertiser friendly.
[122:52.45]And more than 150 videos on my main channel have been deemed that as well.
[122:56.92]And I can tell you that YouTube.com is a great website.
[123:00.90]I'm just going to have to tell you that it's not.
[123:04.14]Over the years, they've pushed from a YouTube to an UsTube.
[123:09.97]That's that.
[123:10.29]I'm talking about, obviously, Google.
[123:12.49]But it's okay.
[123:14.81]I believe that you can appeal some of those things.
[123:16.57]I believe it's not a big deal at all.
[123:18.59]Don't worry about it.
[123:19.50]We're going to be fine.
[123:22.33]uh but yeah apparently like the entire second channel every video was deemed as not advertised from it's good stuff because you know because I mean maybe somebody's like head exploded whatever and I get it I get it look if you're coca-cola maybe you don't want a guy's head exploding on the camera but like but come on every single one what do you think your kids are watching
[123:44.33]What do you think your children are watching?
[123:46.05]You know what I watched when I was like 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 into my 20s?
[123:51.60]A guy's head exploding.
[123:52.90]It happens.
[123:53.76]It's in a video game.
[123:54.46]And sometimes you see somebody's ball bag.
[123:58.66]You know what I'm talking about?
[124:00.93]Why are we so scared of this?
[124:05.75]I just realized it's like music has been playing.
[124:10.97]This fucking music.
[124:16.87]I'm supposed to be setting up the PlayStation 3.
[124:18.57]What the fuck am I doing?
[124:22.10]Alright, give me a sec.
[124:24.22]Again, if you lose me, then it was not intentional.
[124:28.54]I will be back.
[124:29.90]So stay tuned if the stream does happen to go down.
[124:33.51]We're going to find out if that's going to happen right now.
[124:41.25]A couple of beeps.
[124:41.75]A couple of boops.
[124:44.78]And let's get this thing installed.
[124:46.32]What do you say?
[124:48.06]Ha ha ha.
[124:50.28]Ha ha ha.
[124:51.84]Black screen.
[124:52.56]Now we just got a black screen.
[124:54.12]Maybe I should just put my VRB back up again.
[124:56.02]Yeah, I will.
[124:59.34]Oh, god damn it.
[125:01.84]I like rage unplugged this.
[125:03.83]It's coming back and biting me right in the asshole.
[125:07.23]Hold on a sec.
[125:13.81]There it is.
[125:14.77]You're going to hear a Windows ding here in about five seconds.
[125:20.53]Ding.
[125:20.71]Alright.
[125:24.11]Place your bets.
[125:24.67]Is OBS going to crash?
[125:26.21]What do you guys think?
[125:28.46]I wonder what the over-under is.
[125:33.00]Let me go get Kung Fu.
[125:34.80]There it is.
[125:37.78]Remember, we do installs on our stream.
[125:42.16]I install video games.
[125:44.48]That's how you know this is a great stream.
[125:52.10]And let's try to cap this now.
[125:59.31]Installation stream.
[126:00.47]I don't think this game will be installing anything.
[126:03.75]Although I have been very wrong before.
[126:11.84]And...
[126:13.40]Think we're good.
[126:13.92]Let me just add this and I got to do this to my voice.
[126:16.81]Give me one sec Holy shit, what happened if I did that?
[126:26.25]Okay, add the capture device Here it is cross your fingers
[126:40.47]Kung Fu Rider can only be played using the PlayStation Move controller.
[126:43.67]I know.
[126:44.75]I'm aware.
[126:51.78]What happened to Echo?
[126:53.56]It was, uh... N-O-T-W-H-A-T-W-E-T-H-O-G-H-T-I-T-W-A-T-S.
[127:11.58]Play Echo the Dolphin instead.
[127:15.92]Well, here's my PlayStation Move controller.
[127:17.36]Turn it on.
[127:23.50]Come on, pull it in.
[127:24.38]What?
[127:24.68]No signal.
[127:25.80]It's very clearly plugged in.
[127:28.70]I can fucking guarantee it.
[127:33.00]Oh, I guarantee you this shit is plugged in.
[127:36.58]It's selectable.
[127:37.52]It's just no signal.
[127:40.77]It's a beautiful thing.
[127:43.73]It's just fucking wonderful.
[127:45.51]I'll tell you.
[127:48.39]Let me tell you guys.
[127:52.07]Fucking technology, man.
[128:03.11]Hold on.
[128:06.81]I think OBS crashed.
[128:08.58]Yes, it did.
[128:11.16]Of course it did.
[128:13.66]Why wouldn't it fucking crash?
[128:17.52]I'm going to have to be right back, I think.
[128:19.14]Maybe.
[128:20.22]It's possible.
[128:20.68]Oh, my fucking God.
[128:32.98]Well, I'll be right back.
[128:34.41]This is... Fucking... So stupid.
[128:38.77]This shit is getting real, real fucking dumb.
