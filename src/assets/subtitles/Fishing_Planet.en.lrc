[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.76]Hold on.
[00:01.30]Wait a minute.
[00:02.40]Maximum action won the poll?
[00:04.69]When did that happen?
[00:18.43]That... I... There has to be some type of... No, there's got to be some type of... Of coordinated effort here.
[00:27.28]Because Maximum... Fishing planet...
[00:33.14]It's already open.
[00:34.74]I'm going to play it.
[00:35.58]It's already open.
[00:36.26]I've already installed it.
[00:46.44]Well, then just uninstall it.
[00:48.22]That uses data.
[00:52.36]I've seen a lot of people talking about this title.
[00:56.19]It's very simple.
[00:59.31]Yep.
[01:01.31]That's it.
[01:13.36]Somebody voting over and over again.
[01:16.55]Well, the poll is still open.
[01:18.69]Looks like Fishing Planet seems to have crawled over with 42% of the vote.
[01:23.66]Well, it's okay, because like all these kinds of games, I'm either going to think this is really cool and play it for six hours, or I'm going to immediately, within 20 minutes, change to something else.
[01:35.21]We'll find out.
[01:36.77]What's the link?
[01:39.21]Here.
[01:41.33]Anyways, how are you guys doing?
[01:47.69]Here's the poll.
[01:49.93]I've already got it open.
[01:54.90]Like, the election's over.
[01:58.86]I'm not going to get sworn in and all of a sudden it's just like, wait a minute, but what about Jupiter?
[02:09.69]You want a recount?
[02:10.41]Here it is.
[02:15.89]Millions of votes cast for Fishing Planet.
[02:18.37]Actually, what really happened... I'm going to give you guys a breakdown of exactly what happened here.
[02:25.63]I sometimes come, well, not sometimes, every time.
[02:28.41]Because when I'm setting up a stream, I come in and I'm doing scenes on OBS, I'm making sure the game is captured correctly.
[02:35.25]I usually sit here about 30, 40 minutes before a stream.
[02:37.99]I'll go eat, I'll come back, I'll go to the bathroom, whatever.
[02:41.19]The first message that I saw when I sat down into the pre-stream chat was, wake me when he starts playing Fishing Planet.
[02:49.91]And I said, okay, wake up, like I'm going to do it.
[02:53.14]I won guide the one guy.
[02:55.24]And I thought that was funny.
[03:04.18]And then I put it on the poll.
[03:07.26]And people voted for it.
[03:14.63]One guy.
[03:15.33]Wake up.
[03:20.47]It doesn't matter.
[03:21.19]It's already open.
[03:23.33]Hey, you didn't even know this is... It's this person's birthday today.
[03:27.53]You didn't know that.
[03:28.13]It's happy birthday to this person.
[03:32.27]Here's your birthday present.
[03:34.45]It's already open.
[03:42.81]Thank you.
[03:43.21]There he is!
[03:43.99]This is a special birthday present.
[03:52.05]Anyways, Maximum Action is the other game that I have.
[03:55.70]So whether that's today, you know... No, I'm not sure.
[04:00.32]Quit.
[04:02.48]Maximum Action is the other game.
[04:04.38]So if I play this for, like, all day, then whatever, we'll play it tomorrow.
[04:08.80]Right?
[04:11.12]This is Fishing Planet.
[04:12.44]This is going to be a relaxing day.
[04:18.11]Hit enter.
[04:18.65]No.
[04:18.91]Approach the shoreline.
[04:19.85]I was ready for this.
[04:23.27]Make your first cast.
[04:24.33]Aim at the ring.
[04:25.69]By the way, this is an MMO.
[04:28.67]People didn't know that one before they came in.
[04:30.71]Talking shit.
[04:32.58]Alright, so just... What do you mean, aim in the circle?
[04:34.42]Aim at the ring.
[04:35.96]Okay.
[04:40.50]That was not really a cast.
[04:42.40]I kind of just dropped it in there.
[04:46.34]Hold left mouse button.
[04:51.87]Oh, I have to hold it.
[04:52.78]Okay.
[04:53.08]What am I doing wrong?
[05:09.13]It's funny because this is the kind of shit that I would do if I went fishing.
[05:11.65]I never go fishing, but I don't know what to do.
[05:13.37]I always found fishing to be just like a strange thing.
[05:20.89]You throw this little wire into the ocean, or into a lake, and you hope that somebody walks by and bites it?
[05:30.50]I don't think I could win, I, no.
[05:32.70]I'll tell you, I think vish, I think, I think fishing is gonna go away.
[05:36.86]With the iPad generation.
[05:40.71]Because within five minutes, an ad didn't pop up for me to click on.
[05:44.87]Like, warning me about the weather in my area.
[05:47.19]You think Zoomers are going to be able to handle this?
[05:49.82]Playing their, like, iPad game?
[06:06.89]Oh, yeah, right.
[06:07.57]F11, right?
[06:15.01]Okay, I got it.
[06:20.26]Wait for fish to bite.
[06:21.00]This is what we're doing.
[06:22.36]I got bread on there?
[06:23.16]What kind of bread?
[06:25.86]Bread.
[06:26.10]I don't see, I don't see bread.
[06:29.83]Click right mouse.
[06:30.65]Alright.
[06:34.97]Watch that line tension.
[06:39.09]How do I, what do I do?
[06:40.34]Reel?
[06:43.16]There's no more instructions.
[06:45.58]Go get him?
[06:52.12]How do I reel?
[06:53.64]I'm holding down left mouse button.
[06:56.08]What's reel?
[06:59.84]What if I just walk backwards?
[07:07.50]Can I pick it up?
[07:09.46]It's right there.
[07:10.34]Just pick it up.
[07:17.41]I swear to God.
[07:18.97]I'm like slingshotting him around.
[07:21.10]I just want to pick him up.
[07:24.20]What am I doing?
[07:24.94]I can't reel him in.
[07:30.18]Is he still on it?
[07:43.57]How do you reel this in?
[07:48.00]I think I'm stuck on a tree.
[07:54.77]I'm tying myself up.
[07:59.15]Imagine walking by this poor sucker.
[08:02.59]It's like a dog leash.
[08:04.42]Like I went to the dog park.
[08:05.74]Oh, no, no, just go under me.
[08:06.94]I'll go under you.
[08:07.56]It's like seeing another person with a dog.
[08:10.78]Except it's just me.
[08:12.84]Try to reel it in.
[08:14.02]I don't know how to fucking do this.
[08:17.99]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[08:19.03]Not yet.
[08:20.55]Reeling speed.
[08:24.34]Turn move rod.
[08:26.12]Reeling speed.
[08:27.76]Where's reel it in?
[08:33.84]Hold right click.
[08:35.34]That just holds it in the air.
[08:38.43]The fish is still on that.
[08:42.99]No, he's going back in.
[08:43.81]No, I can't let him back in the water.
[08:45.71]He's gonna make it.
[08:54.91]Are you fucking serious?
[08:59.57]There's like bugs on me.
[09:04.92]Get over here.
[09:06.76]I can't, dude.
[09:08.22]I'm fucking... I think I'm done.
[09:13.38]I can't reel it in!
[09:25.05]Right and left click.
[09:28.77]Alright, do I need to turn the webcam on to prove to you guys that I'm pressing left click?
[09:36.27]Pitch cast reel on, pull strike aimed cast, reeling speed, turn move rod.
[09:42.86]It's a bug, snap the line.
[09:46.35]Line break is B. Alright, well let me bring him over here.
[09:49.55]Can I like pick him up?
[09:52.09]Where is he from here?
[10:00.81]Where is he from here?
[10:02.13]Come on.
[10:03.91]Just break the line, line break B.
[10:14.35]B. I think I have to restart the game.
[10:20.25]B. Line break is B, right?
[10:25.85]Maybe like 1, 2?
[10:28.61]How do I get the line to snap?
[10:32.49]Hold right mouse button.
[10:34.17]Yes.
[10:34.63]And then hold left click.
[10:37.61]I don't have like a dummy mouse that I'm pressing.
[10:52.70]I am doing the... I don't have two... Listen!
[10:59.87]What the fuck?
[11:04.17]I, uh... I'm coming.
[11:20.52]Let's try it again.
[11:32.59]Here we go.
[11:35.73]Is it capturing, can you see it?
[11:38.96]Harder than actual, no, I ran into a bug.
[11:46.16]Okay, now, I have music for a second.
[11:49.89]Approach the shoreline.
[11:51.99]Shoreline approached.
[11:54.07]Make your first cast, aim at the ring, click left mouse button.
[12:00.17]Got it.
[12:00.65]Okay.
[12:02.27]Wait for the fish to bite.
[12:03.73]This might take a while.
[12:12.28]Is that one right there?
[12:21.81]Click right mouse button.
[12:22.85]Got it.
[12:24.23]Reel in to Lynn.
[12:25.19]Hold left.
[12:26.29]This wasn't happening before.
[12:29.11]I swear to God, that wasn't happening before I told you.
[12:34.28]That took so fucking long.
[12:38.46]Alright, got four XP to this confetti coming down.
[12:43.32]Alright.
[12:45.50]Make a few casts and catch some fists.
[12:47.16]Alright, now I'm excited.
[12:48.66]Now I'm into this.
[12:56.27]Why is this an MMO?
[12:57.21]I have no idea.
[13:05.96]How can I tell when there's a bite?
[13:06.90]Is it just Bob?
[13:08.48]That's what that means, right?
[13:12.96]Alright.
[13:13.58]That's what I'm talking about.
[13:19.86]Is it too shallow?
[13:24.55]I can't walk around, right?
[13:25.53]That scares the fish.
[13:27.35]You have to stand completely still.
[13:43.67]You can't talk either.
[13:44.55]You can't, like, move your mouth.
[13:52.05]See?
[13:52.45]Told you.
[13:59.19]That wasn't somebody on the line?
[14:00.09]I'm gonna go over here.
[14:05.23]Too early?
[14:05.81]How is that too early?
[14:16.94]Your viewer count is dropping quick.
[14:18.80]Do a facecam.
[14:19.94]Oh, the viewer count is fucking rising.
[14:24.89]7.4 inches, release it.
[14:25.79]Alright, let's get another one.
[14:43.76]Too early, too early, too early.
[14:45.06]Wait, wait, wait.
[14:47.16]Was there one on there?
[14:50.38]Right there?
[14:55.26]Ooh, that's a big one.
[14:56.04]8.6.
[14:58.55]Time for a real catch.
[15:00.13]Ooh.
[15:01.07]Open inventory and change your bait for a bigger fish.
[15:05.87]Uh, drag and drop to set red worms as bait.
[15:13.15]Crappy bluegill pumpkin seed.
[15:15.27]Alright.
[15:18.25]We're putting worms on here now.
[15:19.63]Now let's go to the local shop and get a fish keeper.
[15:23.39]Choose tools and equipment.
[15:28.84]Buy a fish keep net to keep your catch.
[15:32.56]How much is it?
[15:33.60]150 bucks?
[15:34.82]Seems like a lot.
[15:35.48]We're all set here.
[15:36.20]Open the lake map.
[15:38.82]For bigger fish, prefer a good hiding place, so let's select a different fishing spot.
[15:43.67]Alright, what is this?
[15:44.51]Homes is my house.
[15:45.43]I have a basic business license.
[15:49.51]Okay.
[15:51.91]I'm ready.
[15:54.38]This is an actual iPad game.
[16:03.00]I know.
[16:06.94]Alright.
[16:08.97]Here we go.
[16:13.82]Float is on the side because the bait hit the bottom.
[16:17.08]Reel the bait back in.
[16:21.16]How far?
[16:24.36]Decreased the line leader to 19.
[16:26.84]Use the zero button.
[16:31.26]What?
[16:37.19]Oh.
[16:38.87]Line leader changed to 19.
[16:43.71]I have no idea what that means.
[16:45.67]That's like fish talk.
[16:46.73]I don't know what it means.
[16:49.07]That means how much line I give.
[17:09.31]Is that too early?
[17:10.45]I think it was too early.
[17:16.58]Got one.
[17:21.07]What is it?
[17:22.55]Oh, it's a big milk mash.
[17:24.03]It's a crappy.
[17:25.79]Should I keep it?
[17:26.49]It's 13 inches.
[17:27.45]Keep.
[17:31.78]Level up.
[17:32.20]I got 1500 bucks.
[17:33.53]I got a new pond.
[17:35.37]I got a dart, a net, and two... You guys are gonna have to help me out here with this shit.
[17:41.69]Callisto?
[17:43.21]That's a head?
[17:44.83]Hook six, crimson, cold water, golden.
[17:47.86]I don't know what any of these mean.
[17:51.46]Open the lake map to continue your adventure.
[17:56.46]You know what I need to have happen?
[17:59.21]I have to get... I don't know how... I'm gonna have to hook it up to a button on here, I think.
[18:04.00]I want a song to play when I catch a fish.
[18:09.12]Like, while it's on the reel.
[18:10.22]Okay, you can leave the lake now and go home like a real winner, okay?
[18:15.86]Results and rewards.
[18:20.15]So where are the other players?
[18:25.63]Challenge complete.
[18:26.27]Complete the tutorial.
[18:27.73]Alright, so where are we going?
[18:29.32]Where are we dropping, huh?
[18:30.68]What do you guys think?
[18:34.50]How many people are here?
[18:35.14]There's four people here.
[18:36.32]Are these servers?
[18:41.33]Are the... I don't know.
[18:42.25]This is supposed to be... Hold on.
[18:48.61]Did I actually just say, where are we dropping?
[18:51.69]And it automatically is a bad Fortnite joke when I actually just was asking, where are we going?
[19:05.40]Alright, um, let's go to Lone Star Lake.
[19:09.95]Mudwater River.
[19:11.57]How much is this to unlock?
[19:14.73]For six coins?
[19:15.89]I only have two coins.
[19:22.30]Where should I go?
[19:23.72]Go to Alaska?
[19:24.76]I need $10,000 to go here.
[19:30.90]I don't have that kind of money.
[19:32.84]Do I have any missions?
[19:41.07]These numbers are levels.
[19:42.41]Oh.
[19:45.31]So, wait, wait, wait.
[19:46.09]Just go back to my lake?
[19:52.10]It's been like 10 days since my Prime Sim ended and I keep forgetting to resub.
[19:55.46]I'm sorry.
[19:57.20]Why did I read that?
[19:57.88]You don't have to be sorry that you didn't resub.
[20:03.14]Alright, what about this one?
[20:04.78]I want just to go here.
[20:05.46]Ooh, okay, we're going to France.
[20:07.80]Or wherever this is.
[20:10.84]France?
[20:11.70]Yeah.
[20:12.22]Let's go.
[20:13.82]We're going to the check.

[20:24.40]Unlocked.
[20:25.60]Let's go.
[20:26.10]Travel.
[20:28.64]I have 4,400 bucks I can go.
[20:30.04]What do you mean travel cost?
[20:31.26]One day, two days, three days.
[20:32.60]Is this how long I'm allowed to be there?
[20:39.15]Five days.
[20:41.82]You have no fishing license for this state.
[20:43.64]What do you mean, fishing license?
[20:47.33]You have to have a license to fish?
[20:49.33]You do?
[20:50.55]In a different place?
[20:52.19]Uh, Lexi just gave 10 community subs.
[20:53.73]Thank you, Lexi.
[20:54.33]That's a lot of subs.
[20:56.13]10 community subs just, uh, came in.
[21:01.35]Alright, buy a license.
[21:02.87]Thank you, Lexi.
[21:04.75]Basic Czech license.

[21:26.29]Night catch is allowed.
[21:27.47]I'm doing it.

[21:29.91]One day.
[21:30.57]Oops.
[21:31.05]Okay, it's fine.
[21:31.79]We're going to go there for one day.
[21:32.73]Are these friend requests?
[21:35.92]Are they?
[21:36.86]I don't want to even, like, click on it.
[21:39.08]Alright, I got my business license.
[21:40.40]I'm going there.
[21:41.06]I'm going to get... I'm going to go there for one day.
[21:43.96]How the fuck would you even find me?
[21:48.02]Okay.
[21:49.16]Just hold on a minute.
[21:50.00]I'm going.
[21:51.24]Let's go.

[22:02.50]What do they like to eat here?
[22:04.48]Fish species.
[22:05.74]Carp.

[22:16.88]I need corn and peas.
[22:17.92]And pea dough.
[22:19.40]What is pea dough?
[22:21.52]Is that like cookie dough, but peas?
[22:24.12]Okay.
[22:24.96]I'm going to go for one of these.
[22:26.65]Semolina balls.
[22:31.50]Feeder starter.
[22:32.32]What's in here?
[22:34.68]Red worms.
[22:35.70]Dough balls.
[22:38.80]Fuck.
[22:41.26]I think I need these.
[22:42.74]Dough ball fish bait.
[22:45.08]Oh, that's pumpkin seed.
[22:45.96]This is supposed to be the starter bundle.
[22:51.94]Don't I have something right now?
[22:54.42]I got like a new thing, didn't I?
[22:58.48]Bread worms.
[22:59.89]I'm just gonna go in.
[23:02.45]There's at least a few people here that like worms.
[23:08.20]Oh, I unlocked it to buy.
[23:09.54]Okay, I get it.
[23:18.18]Buy beef jerky and bud lights.
[23:22.55]There's somebody here.
[23:29.81]Somebody's waiting for me.
[23:48.24]This is scary.
[23:50.62]Alright, I need to follow along.
[23:53.96]They know the spots.
[23:57.70]Right here?
[23:59.12]Should we go in the same place?
[24:01.81]That's probably not what we should do though.
[24:03.51]Somebody had crossed the way.
[24:07.39]Oh, there he is!
[24:09.29]There he is!
[24:11.33]This person is the person that told me to play the game!
[24:16.43]This is the chat message.
[24:17.49]I remember.
[24:17.95]Level 32.
[24:19.31]Alright, you gotta show me where to go.
[24:21.54]How do I get a mining helmet?
[24:25.54]Alright, I'm going for it.
[24:26.52]This is my spot.
[24:27.22]Is there any bait on here?
[24:38.75]Yeah, there's worms.
[24:45.27]Oh, really showing off here with like the really big cool pole.
[24:54.63]Got something?
[24:57.98]Shit.
[25:03.38]How do you get in one of those outfits?
[25:07.24]Alright, watch out.
[25:08.28]Watch out.
[25:08.90]This is one of those scenarios.
[25:13.32]This is how you get to the hospital.
[25:16.74]Hey!
[25:18.34]Watch the cast!
[25:24.95]Because I end up like going backwards and like... Grabbing somebody by like the fucking cheek.
[25:32.39]Easy.
[25:34.38]I think I'm stuck.
[25:49.93]Okay.
[25:53.13]Okay.
[25:55.41]Alright.
[25:56.05]He's scaring away all the fish.
[26:04.05]Alright, right here.
[26:08.00]I have bait still, right?
[26:08.74]Yeah, worms.
[26:09.34]I need to get something.
[26:10.06]Alright, shh.
[26:21.02]Don't you have to go really easy, like... Gentle reeling?
[26:27.72]I thought that's how you did it.
[26:39.08]How are you guys getting all these things?
[26:40.16]I need to get one.
[26:44.65]Am I stuck on the lily pads?
[26:47.31]Oh, I can't look.
[26:47.93]I can't move.
[27:00.99]Come on, somebody, something, anything.
[27:03.54]I'll take anything right now.
[27:31.16]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[27:34.40]Got it.
[27:37.14]European Perch.
[27:44.03]That was weird.
[27:47.09]Let me see.
[27:47.69]Alright, I'll get the European Perch.
[27:49.61]I'll keep it.
[27:50.00]Alright, now, how much is left in the day?
[27:54.16]5 AM.
[27:57.18]Is this in real time?
[28:07.90]You guys thought I was going to take not enough time to do this.
[28:16.15]I'm going over here.
[28:18.05]How do we get... Person that has 32 levels in this game.
[28:21.31]Do you have a boat?
[28:23.91]Can we get on the boat?
[28:25.11]Can we go on a boat?
[28:29.56]I kind of want to see that.
[28:30.62]Is this possible?
[28:34.94]Can't use boats here.
[28:37.15]Well, can I borrow your license?
[28:38.63]I know that's not how it works, but can I just borrow your license and go on your boat?
[29:03.48]That's a crime.
[29:06.09]Yeah, this is a video game, though.
[29:07.67]This is a video game.
[29:11.13]There is no, like, add to friends, add to your business license.
[29:22.52]I've got news for you guys.
[29:24.48]This is a fishing video game.
[29:27.51]You'll be lucky to catch one fish over the course of three full days.
[29:32.69]Not ten.
[29:50.11]How do I chat?
[29:57.87]What's the chat menu?
[30:01.28]Chat is tab.
[30:30.91]I can't even go into the menu while the rod is stuck.
[30:33.27]I had that same problem earlier.
[30:34.49]Did I ever tell you guys this story?
[30:48.01]About how my brother got banned from Warcraft for like three days?
[30:56.17]For writing in the trade chat?
[31:00.07]You know how people used to do this?
[31:03.03]They'd go like, oh, hey, like, wants to buy a 20 thorium bars, right?
[31:15.31]And they would put that in the chat.
[31:17.42]That would be, yeah, like, if someone wants to buy, like this, 20x thorium bars, like, please send help, right?
[31:27.33]And you'd be like, oh, okay, that's what they want.
[31:29.06]My brother got banned for three days in WoW for writing this.
[31:45.81]It was like, what the fuck are you doing?
[31:50.65]I was like, we were like 15, 16.
[31:51.91]They had to, I didn't say it.
[32:19.65]Where am I stuck?
[32:21.93]What?
[32:23.93]Am I attached to somebody?
[32:25.77]Is that the person that's saying help?
[32:27.65]I'm not, like, attached to that person, am I?
[32:29.33]Uh-oh.
[32:34.82]Anyways, Blizzard, any time you got in trouble in WoW, they had to tell you.
[32:43.58]He thought it was, like, the funniest thing that they had to quote that to him.
[32:46.70]Like, for the reason why he got, like, a suspension.
[32:50.12]I remember just being like, you're a fucking idiot.
[33:05.51]How do I get this off?
[33:15.62]There's 43, 44, 45, 46, 47.
[33:16.33]How far does this go?
[33:18.57]49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54.
[33:19.75]What happens if we get to 216?
[33:21.25]What am I doing?
[33:25.31]Oh, I think I'm letting the line out.
[33:27.21]I gotta spell my name!
[34:08.65]I'm trying to make the E. It's not going to work.
[34:16.36]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[34:17.06]What are you doing?
[34:25.79]I was just coming over here watching this.
[34:54.43]You're under the line.
[34:55.81]Alright, now... Alright, let's make a... That thing is huge!
[35:04.13]Alright, now let's try to reel it up as fast as I can.
[35:09.23]Wait, can I cast it?
[35:13.80]Lasso him up!
[35:30.25]Alright, let's catch a fish.
[35:36.42]I still don't understand where this is.
[35:41.50]It's stuck in there.
[35:43.17]But how do I get it out?
[35:45.23]Break the line.
[35:45.81]Are you sure you want to break the line?
[35:47.01]Yeah.
[35:50.71]Did I just break the line?
[35:52.03]Hold on, did I break my rod in half?
[35:54.34]Why would I do that?
[35:59.33]Oh, it looks like my fishing line's broken.
[36:00.91]May as well snap this thing over my knee.
[36:09.82]No, I did not.
[36:12.92]Inventory.
[36:19.63]Okay, I got line here.
[36:22.06]Adjust the line length.
[36:23.60]By like 140.
[36:24.14]There we go.
[36:26.46]Okay, what's this?
[36:28.02]This is still on here.
[36:28.76]Where's my rod?
[36:34.09]Hook.
[36:35.05]Okay, I got a hook on there.
[36:36.71]Red worms.
[36:37.27]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[36:44.15]How do I equip a fishing rod?
[36:46.39]It's tough.
[37:00.95]That was a weak throw.
[37:06.63]It was fine.
[37:07.65]Let me reel it in a little bit here.
[37:15.18]Excuse me.
[37:21.02]What if we all touch?
[37:24.60]This is probably giving actual people that fish in here anxiety.
[37:35.29]No, I need a better... F11.
[37:37.37]What did I just do?
[37:42.66]Holy fuck.
[37:50.86]Why is my instinct to turn and hit the person next to me in the head with the run?
[37:57.49]I don't know.
[37:57.91]Alright, let me get that again.
[38:05.57]Nice.
[38:06.51]That was not even further than just tossing it out there.
[38:18.46]Catch some grasshoppers.
[38:19.72]With your hands?
[38:22.76]Ooh, what's that?
[38:24.69]Alright, come on now.
[38:25.51]Come on, reel it in.
[38:27.73]Forget this.
[38:28.19]I want to see what you get.
[38:28.97]You have like a shark on there.
[38:33.05]Easy now.
[38:33.49]Easy.
[38:34.25]Easy.
[38:35.32]What is it?
[38:38.38]Oh!
[38:43.58]What?
[38:44.84]That's insane!
[38:46.00]Alright, Jeremy, this ain't mini golf.
[39:00.29]Like, let's go.
[39:03.32]Why am I only going that far?
[39:04.52]Is it zero feet?
[39:07.26]Wait, I saw... I know those are raindrops, never mind.
[39:13.77]In every fishing game, when you see the little doot-doot-doot, that means a fish is in, like, a fishing company's over there.
[39:18.01]Alright, I'm just gonna leave it in.
[39:20.91]I'm not gonna move.
[39:36.28]I don't even like beer, especially Bud Red.
[39:40.31]But I want to just drink a Bud Red right now.
[39:42.55]It's the only time you'll ever hear- I will never say that out loud ever again, except for right now, this only instance.
[40:06.55]I want one of those.
[40:07.15]A regular Budweiser.
[40:17.54]Hold on.
[40:24.77]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[40:26.55]I'm going to get mine here.
[40:30.11]Did I get it?
[40:36.25]I actually did it.
[40:37.49]I ripped it out of the water.
[40:40.97]Guys, guys, come look.
[40:43.72]Show and hide.
[40:45.78]Let me examine.
[40:46.42]Look.
[40:48.22]Look, look, look, look.
[40:49.12]Look what I got.
[40:49.64]Look what I got.
[40:50.10]Look what I got.
[40:50.60]Look what I got.
[40:51.76]Look at this.
[40:52.06]Look at mine.
[40:52.42]Look at my fish.
[40:56.55]Alright, release.
[41:00.63]Level up.
[41:01.51]Cheese.
[41:02.55]Mm-hmm.
[41:07.46]Camo vest.
[41:08.54]I want the cheese.
[41:09.40]I just want to eat that cheese.
[41:10.42]I don't even want to put it on the lore.
[41:14.76]Sinker.
[41:17.02]Barley.
[41:19.69]Chainsaw.
[41:22.37]What else is in here?
[41:23.19]I pretty much unlocked the whole game.
[41:30.72]Go to the settings and enable Big Bobber.
[41:37.36]Big bubber.
[41:46.55]Big bubber.
[41:59.40]Oh, I see what you mean.
[42:00.28]Now you can actually see what you're doing.
[42:06.34]odd to me.
[43:06.17]Give yourself an atomic wedgie.
[43:13.67]Why do I feel like they did that on Jackass at some point?
[43:28.89]Come on, hurry up.
[43:30.97]I know I just said hurry up in a fishing game.
[43:47.76]Come on.
[43:48.38]Anything.
[43:57.87]Why is that a swear?
[44:00.37]You can buy the semolina.
[44:02.91]Excuse you?
[44:03.67]What are you saying?
[44:14.40]Can you not rip...
[44:23.33]Got one!
[44:35.66]I'll keep this one.
[44:41.34]You can't write, like, ball?
[44:45.39]I need more line.
[44:52.00]I need... I want to buy some cheese.
[44:54.04]Where are the big fish?
[44:54.90]Can you catch, like, huge things in this game?
[44:57.04]Where do we find the big ones?
[45:01.56]Throw at green, not yellow.
[45:03.71]Throw at green.
[45:04.25]What do you mean?
[45:12.97]Go to the ocean?
[45:16.83]Go in that house.
[45:18.64]Can we go in there?
[45:19.20]Biggest fish there is... Biggest fish there is a carp, and they get to, like, two pounds.
[45:24.58]Well, that sucks.
[45:25.62]I want to do, like, the... I want to catch, like, the tuna.
[45:31.21]Those things are 13 pounds.
[45:34.29]Add a zero.
[45:37.74]And another zero.
[46:08.68]Rude.
[46:11.67]Thanks.
[46:19.57]I think my favorite part about this... Wait a minute!
[46:21.97]That's a splash.
[46:24.17]That's only one pound.
[46:24.97]That's actually pretty good.
[46:29.08]Alright, this ain't good.
[46:29.64]I gotta cast again.
[46:30.38]I need more lime.
[46:33.62]I need more lime.
[46:34.22]Give me some more lime.
[46:35.68]Missions.
[46:37.47]To become a true Lone Star Explorer, start to catch the listed fish in this lake.
[46:44.51]I'm in another country right now, so you're gonna have to wait a minute.
[46:48.53]I need the Spin Master.
[46:49.77]That's what I want.
[46:50.33]Where's the cheese?
[46:52.77]Bait.
[46:53.81]Cheese.
[46:54.13]Okay, how much money do I have?
[46:59.07]I want a lot of cheese.
[47:03.25]I don't... It's weird that... Oh, there it is.
[47:08.23]I can't buy it.
[47:08.77]Why?
[47:09.01]I need to be, like, level 11?
[47:12.28]For a barley.
[47:12.84]We'll get some of this.
[47:13.40]Alright, here we go.
[47:18.94]Looking for a bluegill.
[47:19.98]What if I get... I want a bluegill.
[47:23.01]Now we also need... A slingshot.
[47:26.89]What?
[47:34.42]Why do I need that?
[47:37.72]Lures.
[47:39.60]What's a good one?
[47:40.89]Gold.
[47:41.31]I'll take the gold one.
[47:45.47]Ground baits?
[47:48.21]Hold on.
[47:48.47]These are just bags of chips?
[47:55.74]Alright, I need reels.
[47:57.22]Okay, this is where it gets good.
[48:00.54]I can buy a mini spin 1200.
[48:03.74]Wait.
[48:04.86]Recovery.
[48:06.14]Look at this thing right here.
[48:09.66]A mini-spin 1200, right?
[48:10.52]That's a better version of this.
[48:14.79]I don't even know what any of this means, but I'm just gonna get it.
[48:20.81]Why can I not equip it?
[48:23.67]Okay, Lions.
[48:25.21]I want some good shit.
[48:27.97]Mono... Why is this more expensive?
[48:31.98]XXL.
[48:34.55]Length, 300 yards.
[48:35.85]Alright, we'll get some.
[48:39.99]500 yards.
[48:40.53]Okay.
[48:42.53]Mono leader.
[48:45.77]Floro.
[48:48.29]No, that's in-game currency.
[48:52.74]I'm just going to get them.
[48:53.52]I don't know what they really do.
[48:55.40]Tackle.
[48:56.40]Hooks.
[48:57.24]Hook six.
[48:57.84]I have hook eight.
[49:00.48]Oval.
[49:02.60]I need to go... Chubby?
[49:03.20]Chubby?
[49:06.32]Floating weight high.
[49:07.78]Shape chubby.
[49:09.66]Make it easy to see at long distances.
[49:11.68]Anything from panfish to salmon to steelhead.
[49:14.78]I guess it's just aesthetically pleasing to get the chubby one.
[49:20.45]Alright, let's go.
[49:21.21]I already own this.
[49:24.61]Alright, six.
[49:25.41]Hook six.
[49:28.55]Line.
[49:30.89]Mono 005.
[49:33.87]We'll take it at 139 feet, I guess.
[49:36.87]Cheese!
[49:37.93]Looking for a bluegill.
[49:40.26]What kind of hook do I got on there?
[49:41.32]Alright, where do I get a bluegill?
[49:44.54]Map.
[49:49.92]None of these are bluegills.
[49:53.19]There's a goldfish, too.
[49:56.29]Alright, not this way.
[49:59.15]No, no, no, no, no.
[49:59.73]Back up.
[50:02.13]What about over here?
[50:04.01]Ooh, look at this.
[50:05.74]Carp, roach, perch.
[50:07.68]No, I need a bluegill.
[50:08.36]Where can I get a bluegill?
[50:11.92]What's my level?
[50:13.40]Three?
[50:16.42]Do they eat cheese?
[50:19.07]Who eats cheese here?
[50:29.58]Me and the common carp have the same diet.
[50:36.31]Like, in order of how often you consume them.
[50:43.33]Nobody wants cheese here.
[50:44.21]No.
[50:50.07]Cheese.
[50:51.11]Okay, I'm leaving.
[50:52.15]I'm going home.
[50:52.79]Nobody here wants cheese.
[50:53.67]I have to leave.
[50:54.15]Alright, we're out.
[51:01.46]I'm going to do one more attempt here.
[51:06.19]Was this one?
[51:07.45]No.
[51:09.71]Let's get one more fish.
[51:16.15]Alright, what have I got for... I've got cheese on here.
[51:17.97]Anybody wants cheese?
[51:26.10]What's my favorite cheese?
[51:27.04]It really depends on the scenario, because there's a lot of different answers to that question.
[51:33.94]Swiss cheese is the best on sandwiches.
[51:38.40]I think without a doubt.
[51:41.04]Asiago cheese is really good on pretty much everything, no matter what it is, especially when it's baked onto something else, into a crust.
[51:48.70]I don't like brie.
[51:49.66]It reminds me of throw up.
[51:50.80]It smells and tastes like puke.
[51:51.96]I don't like it.
[51:55.37]Aguda, blue cheese are both very good.
[52:03.33]And I don't trust any cheese where you can eat the rind.
[52:06.24]Oh, brie.
[52:07.60]Have some brie.
[52:09.65]I don't want to eat the lemon rind.
[52:11.15]That shit's pretty much made out of plastic.
[52:12.61]I don't want to eat it.
[52:24.23]Havarti's good, yeah.
[52:35.99]Do a cheese tier list.
[52:39.69]Of course that exists.
[52:42.47]Do I like Munster?
[52:44.24]I only like Munster cheese when it's on a plate, sliced into small squares, and there's a cracker right next to it.
[52:49.86]I don't eat it anywhere else.
[52:56.77]Blue cheese, it's my favorite on anything.
[53:01.61]I would put blue cheese on anything.
[53:03.49]And I'm not talking about blue cheese crumble.
[53:04.95]I'm talking about the blue cheese sauce.
[53:07.53]Not blue cheese dressing.
[53:08.98]Get it right.
[53:11.08]Oh, blue cheese dressing.
[53:12.26]No, no, no, no, no.
[53:13.04]Blue cheese sauce.
[53:15.70]The thicker blue cheese.
[53:17.94]See, people always confuse this.
[53:19.54]And sometimes when you go to a restaurant and you get blue cheese, oh, you want blue cheese.
[53:22.60]Yeah, I'll take a side of blue cheese.
[53:24.40]Yeah, I'll take blue cheese on that.
[53:26.36]It's the blue cheese dressing that you put on a salad.
[53:31.16]No, get that away from me.
[53:44.74]What is blue cheese sauce?
[53:45.80]It's thicker.
[53:47.34]It has a thicker base.
[53:49.10]It can be dunked into with like chicken fingers, especially buffalo chicken.
[53:55.88]Buffalo chicken tenders and that blue cheese thick sauce.
[54:02.03]The thick dunkable blue cheese.
[54:05.67]Find me a better appetizer and I'll fucking say alright.
[54:14.08]The biggest offense of any restaurant, I don't care who they are, I don't care what they specialize in, I don't care what their star rating is.
[54:21.51]If you order blue cheese with a meal, and they give you a packet of blue cheese dressing on the side, do not ever go there again.
[54:30.03]I think my line's too long.
[54:46.79]We got this woman.
[54:47.85]You see this form?
[54:58.52]It's mold.
[55:01.94]Yeah, and guys, please.
[55:05.28]You're eating mold.
[55:06.22]Do you know?
[55:07.00]Did you know that you eat over 12 inches of dirt every single meal?
[55:13.29]Did you guys know that?
[55:15.01]Every single meal you eat over 12, at least 12 inches of dirt.
[55:23.70]We're talking at least that much.
[55:29.90]Do I have a source on that?
[55:32.02]Yeah, because you're eating about 12 inches at least off the ground.
[55:44.09]I got another one for you!
[55:51.11]Turn my mic back on.
[55:56.43]Why?
[55:56.65]Nobody eats cheese here?
[56:09.70]Did you know you drank over 12 liters of monster energy a month?
[56:17.31]No, don't do that.
[56:17.99]That's like an easy way to get a heart attack.
[56:20.08]Don't do that.
[56:36.38]Do a cheese tasting stream?
[56:38.60]I'd like to do a catch a fish on game stream, if I could do that.
[56:44.08]Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, come on!
[56:51.81]Got it.
[56:53.81]What is it?
[56:55.35]Ooh, it's a common roach.
[56:58.63]Release.
[57:05.95]How about, uh... This game's actually, like, kind of fun.
[57:10.17]I'm not gonna... I saw at least 150 comments of people saying, why don't you play one of the good fishing games?
[57:17.90]This is alright.
[57:18.94]This is, like, not a bad one.
[57:25.42]The line's a little too long.
[57:31.20]Ban that guy for three days.
[57:42.39]No, cheese is good, but you can't eat cheese too often.
[57:47.01]It just turns into cement in your body.
[57:55.22]Got it.
[57:55.74]European perch.
[58:01.84]No.
[58:02.49]I want at least half a pound.
[58:11.79]Can we go ice fishing in this game?
[58:21.22]You can?
[58:27.08]That's actually kind of cool.
[58:39.84]Has anyone ever tried to make a fantasy fishing game?
[58:43.38]No?
[58:43.62]People make a fantasy game and then put fishing in.
[58:47.82]Usually.
[58:48.14]Well, we got a little bit of a bite there.
[58:53.25]Unlock Mudwater River as soon as possible.
[58:56.67]Okay.
[58:58.05]There's big catfish there.
[58:59.09]Do they like cheese?
[59:03.07]I'll tell you, you know what I do love?
[59:04.77]A restaurant that has a good... I'm gonna say this wrong, because I don't know the names of things.
[59:08.71]I just know what it is.
[59:09.53]I just know when it comes in front of me.
[59:11.53]I just know what it is.
[59:13.19]Uh, I'm gonna say it.
[59:14.55]I don't know.
[59:15.75]A chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick... Chick...
[59:31.64]I know what it is.
[59:33.10]It's the board with the figs and the cheeses and the prosciutto and the ham and the salami and the olives.
[59:39.80]I love those things.
[59:40.85]And when a restaurant does one of those good, they, oh, that's all you need.
[59:45.39]Just order one of those and just eat it.
[59:51.95]A charcuterie board.
[59:53.51]Charcuterie board.
[59:54.21]There it is.
[60:03.79]Just eat raw meat off the plate.
[60:05.65]What do you mean raw meat?
[60:06.63]Prosciutto is not raw.
[60:07.61]Is prosciutto raw meat?
[60:09.85]No, it's not.
[60:16.34]Raw meat?
[60:18.80]Yeah, it's cured.
[60:20.06]They don't just like do an ice cream scoop of like 80-20 grocery store ground beef.
[60:28.68]It's cured meat.
[60:39.62]Cured is raw.
[60:40.80]No, it's been cooked because it's been cured.
[60:46.39]It's salted to a point where it cooks it.
[60:49.84]I don't know what that means.
[60:51.16]I told you, I just point to stuff at the menu.
[61:11.74]I had it right.
[61:12.50]Yes, it's salted to a point where bacteria can... I know, I know.
[61:15.55]And I said it right, but people go to question mark.
[61:18.59]They go like this.
[61:19.25]What did this guy just say?
[61:23.73]It's salted to a point where it's... Why am I not getting any bites?
[61:46.86]Now, I know curing me doesn't cook to me, but I know.
[61:49.69]I'm just... Listen to me.
[61:52.71]I'll take a charcuterie board, please.
[61:55.81]With extra figs, because they're delicious.
[62:13.12]You sound like an annoying me with that voice.
[62:16.22]Which one?
[62:18.24]An annoying Mii.
[62:19.80]Miis don't talk.
[62:20.62]Do Miis talk?
[62:29.35]I've never heard a Mii talk before.
[62:35.09]The only- the closest thing I can think of is just when you hit okay on the menu with a Mii, it just goes like They don't have a voice.
[62:47.65]Fortnite... Okay, Fortnite Jimmy just, like, screwed up that whole thing.
[62:55.95]I was seriously about to catch a fish right there.
[63:12.77]Watch it.
[63:13.67]Watch it.
[63:14.93]What do you got?
[63:15.47]Let's see it.
[63:15.85]What do you got going on here?
[63:16.97]I want to see.
[63:17.25]What do you got going on here?
[63:17.97]You got something, don't you?
[63:22.59]What is it?
[63:25.36]That's pretty big.
[63:28.38]For a second I thought that... One pounded.
[63:30.32]Almost pounded in half.
[63:32.92]Nice.
[63:35.26]Kick that person so I can get in.
[63:40.16]I didn't think there was that much demand for a fishing planet.
[63:44.04]Apparently there is.
[63:53.05]There's not.
[63:54.65]Well, here we are.
[64:01.69]I would have had something here, too.
[64:02.67]Uh-oh.
[64:10.93]Fortnite Jimmy 2010.
[64:12.41]Starting to show signs of agitation.
[64:19.07]All caps.
[64:25.66]Come on, something.
[64:37.55]I teach elementary.
[64:38.45]All my kids love Fortnite.
[64:41.79]Yeah, it's Fortnite, you know, whatever.
[64:47.75]I'm trying to think of the games that I liked.
[64:50.77]When I was younger.
[64:51.57]It's hard to compare though, because we're in a different world.
[64:56.25]We're in like a constant, completely connected, and somebody, the same person has walked by my screen like ten times.
[65:02.63]Am I going crazy?
[65:05.46]That was the same person, right?
[65:11.93]Okay, I just wanted to know if I was freaking out or not.
[65:16.35]Yeah, games have changed.
[65:18.33]We're constantly connected.
[65:25.30]Diablo II was probably that game for me.
[65:27.90]You could play that game online.
[65:31.92]But, it got to a point... You wanna know when Diablo II was ruined completely forever?
[65:38.19]When you would join a game, and no matter what, every 25 seconds, a bot would enter the room and spam a buy items website.
[65:49.65]It happened thousands of times if you joined a public server.
[65:53.51]That was the day when that started happening that the game was over.
[65:58.25]They would come in, and they'd have a name like this.
[66:09.59]Like, okay, here we go.
[66:11.62]And you'd get that... And then they would get booted from the game.
[66:23.55]They would just spam.
[66:24.37]It would be like... You'd get that message sound.
[66:28.81]In Diablo II, they walked by again.
[66:34.96]So you had to make private rooms...
[66:40.02]At that point, it was hard to play the game online.
[66:42.36]Unless you had specific people that could join a room with a password.
[66:50.40]Hold on.
[66:50.82]Finally.
[66:52.06]Finally.
[66:52.40]It's been so long.
[66:57.44]I just caught it.
[66:59.16]Almost seven-tenths of a pound.
[67:02.54]Whatever that denomination is.
[67:03.68]Almost a pound.
[67:05.36]Seven almosts of a pound.
[67:08.14]Pretty good.
[67:12.87]Keeping that one.
[67:14.61]Chunky Baloney, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[67:17.23]Thank you, Chunky.
[67:20.51]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[67:21.63]It's a lot.
[67:24.16]The last two days, people have just been coming in with these huge community subs.
[67:28.86]And huge amounts of money.
[67:30.62]I see one right there.
[67:32.76]Thank you guys, for real.
[67:35.18]This is an outrage.
[67:36.10]Play the next game.
[67:37.80]We're just hanging out and talking.
[67:40.99]I'm trying to give you guys the real fishing experience, because what happens is when you go fishing, I've been fishing a few times, is let's say you go with three or four people.
[67:48.85]Two or three of those people want to just sit silently and just hang out, while the other fourth person, which is me, does not stop talking and annoys everybody there.
[67:58.52]Always bringing up new topics, always bringing up things to discuss.
[68:02.24]I'm the fourth annoying guy.
[68:05.12]And then the other three in a private chat text on their phones are talking about how we're not going to bring Jeremy next time.
[68:13.48]Like, hey, you want to go fishing again?
[68:14.60]Yeah, just like us.
[68:15.50]And they don't have to say anything.
[68:18.10]They don't say a word.
[68:20.32]They just make the group chat without my number in it.
[68:24.75]That's it.
[68:25.15]That's their way of doing that.
[68:27.55]They don't go, oh, that was annoying.
[68:28.99]No, no, no.
[68:29.31]They just make that group chat without me.
[68:33.68]And I'm like, hey guys, you want to go fishing?
[68:35.16]Let's go fishing again.
[68:37.12]Yeah, yeah, no, maybe.
[68:38.16]And then, yeah, maybe.
[68:42.03]Weirdly enough, they say a certain line every time.
[68:43.85]They're like, oh yeah, we'll look into that.
[68:45.03]I'll look into that.
[68:46.09]I'm like, oh, look into that, okay.
[69:01.99]That's the biggest one yet.
[69:03.54]I got $44 for this one.
[69:11.30]Let's show this one off.
[69:12.42]This one's got, this one's like thick here.
[69:13.96]Let's show it.
[69:18.73]This is on my keep net.
[69:21.33]Alright, I got a nine inch Prussian carp.
[69:26.35]This one, I mean, get rid of this one.
[69:28.21]Can I sell them?
[69:29.96]Or does releasing sell them?
[69:32.57]Or do I have to sell them in, like, a shop?
[69:33.94]Because that one's not good enough.
[69:38.22]Keep this one.
[69:42.42]Buy a casting rod?
[69:43.28]Well, I gotta get money first.
[69:50.73]But now fishing is... Okay, I screwed that up.
[69:59.39]After you start the next day, you'll sell them.
[70:00.93]Alright, what time is it?
[70:03.47]7.44 a.m.
[70:06.27]This is going to take a very long time.
[70:12.76]I can't believe I'm spending my Tuesday afternoon playing a virtual fishing game with some old boomer.
[70:18.52]Well, believe it.
[70:25.54]I'm sorry.
[70:25.92]I'm going to level with me here.
[70:29.88]Tuesday afternoon, it's just like kind of right almost in the middle of the week.
[70:33.98]Weekday.
[70:34.76]Like, that's not a problem.
[70:35.78]What's wrong with that?
[70:36.36]You know, it's like 5 o'clock Pacific.
[70:41.26]Just hanging out.
[70:41.84]There's nothing wrong with that.
[70:43.52]This is when you go fishing.
[70:44.64]You go fishing on like Tuesday afternoon at like 4 in the morning or like 4 or 5 o'clock at night.
[70:56.10]This is the time to do this.
[71:13.53]Hey guys, let's not bring Jeremy to the next fishing trip.
[71:16.55]He just won't fucking stop talking.
[71:26.14]You got me.
[71:27.56]So what happens if you end the day early?
[71:29.32]Do I have enough money to end the day early?
[71:31.04]Should I just go somewhere else?
[71:32.64]I need to find a fish that's at least worth selling, that's worth some money.
[71:44.53]Come on, right here.
[71:45.13]You know, sometimes you look over at the chat, or you look at, you know, somebody in the community will say something along the lines of, wow, I like this stream a lot.
[72:05.96]I'd watch him paint a fence.
[72:09.75]You're being tested right now.
[72:23.39]This is where I cut to a live camera of me with like a painter's outfit on.
[72:29.40]And I got like a bucket of paint in my hand with a fence behind me.
[72:32.48]Now that would have been funny.
[72:35.02]Damn.
[73:02.85]He streams twice every other week and decides to play this.
[73:05.55]You're not keeping up.
[73:06.85]That's not fair.
[73:11.29]That's inaccurate.
[73:12.71]Inaccurate.
[73:14.35]That's an inaccurate statement.
[73:25.85]Do I know how to fish?
[73:28.20]I don't think you can know how to fish.
[73:42.71]I think it just happens.
[73:56.17]That means he doesn't.
[74:17.71]You guys are fucking funny.
[74:21.18]Streams twice every other week.
[74:23.20]That's bullshit.
[74:31.47]Ooh, this one sucks.
[74:41.91]If you go to a Twitch stats website, actually, this is real data, I actually stream about 15 to 16 times a month.
[74:50.96]Probably like 17, 15 to 17 times a month is my accurate stats on Twitch.
[75:01.88]That means statistically there's a stream every other day.
[75:05.28]Statistically speaking.
[75:08.43]Three days in a row, two days off, two days in a row, three days off, three days in a row, three days off.
[75:14.17]It's kind of how it happens.
[75:21.88]Every other week.
[75:23.80]No, that would mean that I would stream seven days in a row.
[75:28.26]Alright, you know what?
[75:29.14]They're correct.
[75:30.26]You're right.
[75:30.87]You are correct.
[75:32.23]That's accurate.
[75:33.25]That means week one, I don't stream for seven straight days.
[75:37.19]Week two, I stream seven days in a row.
[75:40.27]Week three, zero.
[75:43.45]Seven days straight of no streams.
[75:45.16]Week four, seven straight days of streams.
[75:47.12]That's inaccurate though.
[75:48.60]That's misleading.
[76:07.73]typed that every day for a year and then don't stream for a year yeah I'm an every other year streamer
[76:51.07]You know, I love board chat.
[76:53.55]It's one of my favorite chats.
[77:05.91]Wiggle the pole?
[77:07.43]That doesn't do anything.
[77:11.82]Yeah, board chat does get bad real fast, you're right.
[77:21.84]Just wait till I go get a catfish and everybody PogChamps and you forget.
[77:41.22]Still waiting for your opinion on French cuisine.
[77:49.22]Why would I do this when I can fish in real life?
[77:53.31]I'm not sure if you know this, but I live in the desert.
[78:00.77]This is all I can do.
[78:06.88]Fish for sandworms.
[78:19.87]Go fish in the Hoover Dam?
[78:24.16]You guys were giving me shit earlier about me not having a business license to go to Czech Republic to get a fish.
[78:34.10]And now you're telling me to go fish in the Hoover Dam.
[78:44.72]Go fishing.
[78:45.88]I wasn't even paying attention.
[78:47.70]That's what happens.
[78:48.62]That's everybody falls asleep.
[78:51.30]I wonder how many opportunities are missed to fish because three or four people go to bed in lounge chairs and all their fishing poles are like shaking around and they don't even do it.
[79:21.55]Let me help this guy out.
[79:31.65]Holy shit!
[79:32.97]Wow!
[79:33.55]Great minds think alike.
[79:35.28]See, now that person's gonna think that's real.
[79:59.12]There's a lot of smiley faces here.
[80:00.87]There's this smiley faces here.
[80:02.03]There's like, I gotta, I gotta correct this.
[80:03.78]There's too many.
[80:04.24]There's like happy smiling faces.
[80:54.46]What's wrong with that?
[80:56.88]The drake sword sucks.
[81:00.90]The Drake Sword is the best early game weapon you can possibly use in that game.
[81:05.12]Just get it and use it without even upgrading it for like fucking 12 hours.
[81:11.19]The Drake Sword is for idiots.
[81:14.05]We're not talking about like intelligence levels.
[81:16.43]We're talking about like how to make the game easier for you.
[81:27.07]I lost my one opportunity.
[81:39.93]MonkaS.
[81:40.55]This guy probably likes TF2 more than the classic game Overwatch.
[81:43.39]MonkaS.
[81:47.05]Yeah, I do.
[81:48.23]Whatever.
[81:48.53]I want to get on a boat.
[81:57.69]Alright.
[81:57.99]How much money do I have?
[81:59.76]There's not a fish on the line right now.
[82:02.50]If there is, I'm going to laugh my ass off.
[82:04.60]Nice.
[82:04.86]I got lied to and I could have probably sat there.
[82:06.50]And I'm going over here.
[82:25.31]Get a jet ski.
[82:27.13]Get a jet ski and drive, like, really fast and turn, pull, brake, and, like, spray everybody.
[82:32.69]Ah, fuck.
[82:42.30]Get to level four for the next area.
[82:43.94]Am I there now?
[82:44.88]No, level two?
[82:45.50]What level am I?
[82:46.20]I have to type to know.
[82:52.46]Level three.
[83:03.44]Give me something.
[83:12.77]Can you wake me up in 30 minutes?
[83:14.01]Yes.
[83:15.37]Lewis Cheese.
[83:16.69]In 30 minutes, I'm going to fucking call out your name.
[83:19.93]Exactly 30 minutes from right now.
[83:24.48]That would be 1 hour and 54 minutes stream time.
[83:32.75]Gonna forget?
[83:33.23]No, I won't.
[83:41.65]Yes, you will.
[83:42.19]I will not forget that.
[83:43.49]What's his name?
[83:44.79]Lewis Cheese.
[83:45.61]Didn't forget.
[83:48.41]Go to bed.
[83:49.02]See you in 30 minutes.
[84:07.00]Is there even bait on this?
[84:12.32]I have French toast sticks in the oven.
[84:13.84]Wake me up in five minutes so I can flip them over.
[84:15.54]Don't turn the oven on and go to bed.
[84:17.80]What are you, out of your mind?
[84:33.85]Alright, something's gotta change here.
[84:36.02]This is not working out.
[84:39.29]I need bread.
[84:41.55]I'm going to try bread.
[84:43.39]Worms aren't working right now.
[84:46.21]Try to get a crappy with these.
[84:47.85]Crappy... Where's my other... I don't know where it is.
[84:53.44]Slop spoon.
[84:55.72]I can't use that here.
[85:01.53]It's time for fun boat time.

[85:09.47]I'm going over here.
[85:10.07]I need to get to level four so I can go to the next area.
[85:24.52]Beer powers up your fishing rod.

[85:53.43]Jimmy.
[86:03.63]Drink monster.
[86:04.59]Drink white monster.
[86:05.71]No, why would I do that?
[86:12.24]If I drink a monster... I just get heartburned.
[86:19.61]This, okay, I'm just gonna give you some anecdotal evidence here.
[86:22.71]This anecdotally, whenever I drink an energy drink, I get heartburn and my eyes hurt.
[86:31.30]I just don't, I'm not gonna drink one of those.
[86:33.88]All of them across the board pretty much do this.
[86:54.09]Too much energy from my body.
[86:58.25]No.
[86:59.57]You should be eating fucking vegetables and fruits and shit.
[87:08.59]How many times do we have to have this conversation?
[87:12.06]Eat a banana.
[87:20.06]Pretty good.

[87:43.94]Not premium.
[87:44.98]Premium.
[87:45.48]Does it have to buy it or something?
[87:49.51]Sorry, Jimmy.
[87:55.08]Day two.
[87:56.26]I didn't... What do you mean, day two?
[88:00.35]This is the first time I've ever played this game.
[88:01.89]Alright, where's that mud river?
[88:03.75]There it is.
[88:04.17]Let me get a license for it.
[88:07.69]Twelve hundred bucks to be here.
[88:09.53]Whatever.
[88:09.83]Uh, advanced license.

[89:18.18]Nice, alright.
[89:19.48]What's up?
[89:20.90]So what fishes are here?
[89:23.15]Fish species, we've got catfish.
[89:27.97]They like marshmallow, pet food, leeches, and s- okay, marshmallows.
[89:33.09]Dough balls, I don't have any of those.
[89:34.31]Dough balls.
[89:35.83]I gotta buy some fate here.
[89:37.53]Bloodworms.
[89:39.07]I need marshmallows.
[89:39.85]Alright, marshmallows and pet food.
[89:47.49]How much are marshmallows?
[89:50.27]Did I unlock marshmallows yet?
[89:57.54]I can't even get marshmallows.
[89:58.68]How much is a boat?
[90:08.17]But there is pet food.
[90:09.03]Okay.
[90:17.37]By the balls, I can't.
[90:18.17]I have to be level 11.
[90:23.31]Alright, so let's get the pet food on here.
[90:29.13]Okay, do I need a certain line or something?
[90:31.90]Or a certain hook for this?
[90:34.34]150 length?
[90:39.46]Long line?
[90:42.77]Short line?
[90:48.47]Hook six.
[90:51.05]Okay, let's see.
[90:53.96]Let's go.
[90:56.55]Got my line here.
[91:00.37]What is my lead?
[91:04.47]18, 25, 30 inches?
[91:06.65]That sounds about right.
[91:11.00]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[91:12.22]That's not right.
[91:12.80]I got pet food on there though.
[91:13.90]No, no, no.
[91:14.10]I got to throw it.
[91:16.08]F11.
[91:22.44]One and a half pound catfish.
[91:25.16]Nice.
[91:26.83]Nice, dude.
[91:28.07]Right here.
[91:32.23]Here we go.
[91:41.02]Hey, they're new to the streams anyways.
[91:42.22]I think you can do a dab at some point.
[91:44.04]There's no pressure.
[91:44.90]It's just my... It's red on my screen, so I have to read them.
[91:50.47]Here we go.
[91:50.89]Here we go.
[91:51.35]Come on, come on, come on.
[91:51.97]Strike it.
[91:52.27]Strike.
[91:53.07]Strike.
[91:55.46]Come on.
[91:56.90]Get on there.
[91:57.62]I know you want to get on that.
[92:00.64]You showed interest for a second.
[92:01.94]Come on.
[92:06.06]I had it.
[92:06.40]Come on.
[92:17.66]There it is.
[92:18.00]There it is.
[92:18.34]There it is.
[92:21.92]Mmmmm.
[92:26.14]Ooh, easy, easy.
[92:29.74]Pumpkin seed.
[92:30.46]12 bucks?
[92:33.70]No, get out of here.
[92:37.57]I want to go to another spot.
[92:38.41]You want to know how you make this game insane and have everybody talk about it and just be like, oh, you have to play it?
[92:47.81]Have, like, a werewolf jump out of here, jump scare the fuck out of you, and then you put, like, your rod, you flip it upside down, it becomes a weapon, and it's a first-person fucking, like, fantasy fighting game.
[93:11.68]Entirely different game.
[93:12.98]No, just for this one spot.
[93:14.26]You know how many BuzzFeed articles will be written on your game?
[93:21.30]You can have this fishing game be completely normal.
[93:36.77]Everyone just camp that spot.
[93:38.01]Yeah, make it like a 0.2% chance to happen.
[93:47.60]Actually, peeing in the river helps attract fish.
[93:50.50]I feel like that's weird enough to be true.
[94:04.27]Interest.
[94:16.17]Interesting.
[94:19.73]It might already be in there and nobody's done it enough to trigger the warning.
[94:25.05]It's possible.
[94:30.41]It's true.
[94:31.15]Fish smell the ammonia in urine.
[94:35.11]See, the first person that said that it was weird enough to be true, that second comment was just specific enough to be false.
[94:53.65]Somebody bite this.
[95:02.00]Try again.
[95:08.14]This way.
[95:09.28]When am I going to close this game and stream Just Dance 4?
[95:17.27]I'll give you a spoiler for one of the 37 Kinect games that I have.
[95:23.98]You want to get spoiled on one of them?
[95:25.28]I'll do it.
[95:34.60]I'm just going to show a flash on camp.
[95:41.98]You ready?
[95:44.31]Hope you guys can catch it.
[96:17.27]How's fishing going?
[96:18.01]Pretty good.
[96:18.43]I'm not doing bad.
[96:24.63]Right, right, right.
[96:25.45]Come on, come on, come on.
[96:26.37]Somebody's on it.
[96:30.48]Come on.
[96:32.00]Somebody's looking at it.
[96:33.50]I want a catfish, please.
[96:37.18]Catch a fish, dumbass.
[96:38.36]That's not how this works.
[96:42.10]You could be the best fisherman in the world.
[96:47.81]And the fish just don't want to bite today.
[96:51.73]I am solely reliant on another party to be able to be good at this.
[97:04.46]What do I mean false?
[97:07.58]Sometimes the fish just don't want to bite today.
[97:13.51]You could do all kinds of, like, little tricks like this, like, turn, turn, turn, turn, twist!
[97:17.70]Turn, turn, turn, turn, twist!
[97:18.92]Everybody has their own little thing they do, right?
[97:20.32]But if the fish isn't hungry, they're not going to bite your... It's not going to work.
[97:26.12]Different spot.
[97:26.76]Yeah, this spot sucks.
[97:30.39]Watch out for the fucking werewolf.
[97:36.07]You're not going to find a catfish here.
[97:37.23]Just go on Tinder.
[97:48.97]What the fuck?
[97:55.59]10 out of 10 joke.
[97:56.61]I didn't make it.
[97:57.25]I was responding to it.
[97:58.59]I was reacting.
[97:59.37]React more!
[98:07.73]There's still pet food on here, right?
[98:08.79]Come on.
[98:18.04]Nice and easy.
[98:18.42]Just quick.
[98:19.98]Just to show that I'm moving around.
[98:21.98]I see it on the left side of the screen.
[98:26.49]Did you see that?
[98:27.05]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[98:34.67]Somebody get it!
[98:35.91]Somebody get it!
[98:39.83]Do it!
[98:41.29]It's right there.
[98:42.30]You're right here.
[98:43.16]I want you to grab it.
[98:44.44]Just get it.
[98:46.22]Almost there.
[98:46.96]Please!
[98:49.72]Just pull it down.
[98:51.08]Got him.
[98:58.11]Now that's a big one.
[98:59.05]13.3 inches over a pound.
[99:00.47]Nice.
[99:09.45]I wish you could walk in the water.
[99:10.75]Just walk in there and show.
[99:12.98]That's big.
[99:14.36]Alright, that one's money.
[99:16.14]We'll have some money for that.
[99:18.00]It's too bad catfish tastes like ass.
[99:23.11]I have to say, I don't think I've ever had it before.
[99:25.19]I don't think I've ever eaten catfish.
[99:40.92]Let's just relax here and... Oops, whoops.
[99:44.78]No, I don't want to open the menu.
[99:48.18]I don't want to open the menu.
[99:53.36]What do you... When do you... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[99:54.64]Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes.
[99:55.68]Somebody coming?
[99:56.96]Somebody coming?
[100:00.29]Timed out?
[100:00.85]What?
[100:01.11]It didn't even move.
[100:06.95]It was just barely bobbing a little.
[100:11.46]That's annoying.
[100:20.32]Catfish eat mostly just shit stuff, so they taste like shit.
[100:24.76]I can't.
[100:28.84]Hold on.
[100:29.45]It's still here.
[100:34.47]Come on.
[100:39.49]What is it?
[100:43.31]That's even bigger.
[100:44.05]1.2 pounds.
[100:45.19]Almost 13.7 inches.
[100:53.00]Larry.
[100:54.26]Keep it.
[100:56.16]Nice.
[100:58.12]Okay.
[100:59.46]This spot actually is pretty good.
[101:02.84]Check this spot over here.
[101:04.50]Is there another spot besides this way?
[101:07.02]Can I go this way?
[101:08.02]Like to the left?
[101:08.58]I don't know.
[101:14.81]What was that?
[101:15.41]What the fuck?
[101:18.41]What?
[101:21.23]What the fuck?
[101:22.67]How do I pick- How do I take the weapon out?
[101:28.11]How do I take out the weapon?
[101:32.17]Let's go motherfucker!
[101:33.93]I'm ready!
[101:34.27]Is he gone?
[101:51.65]So I've never had it before.
[101:52.81]Catfish is... Catfish is one of those things that I feel like it's at a ton of restaurants, but not at any restaurants.
[102:03.32]It's weird.
[102:05.20]I see it on menus and I'm like, oh, they have fucking catfish here all the time.
[102:08.62]But then when I want to try it, it's never there.
[102:10.28]You have to cook it really carefully.
[102:23.13]I scared your cat?
[102:24.23]I'm sorry.
[102:26.63]I'm sorry.
[102:27.29]I didn't mean to scare your cat.
[102:42.48]He scared me.
[102:44.64]But why the fuck would they put that in this game?
[102:46.86]That's not fucking cool.
[102:48.26]That's stupid.
[102:50.73]Why would you ever put that in a game and scare the shit out of everybody that plays it?
[102:54.89]What a bad idea.
[102:55.81]It's supposed to be a relaxing fishing game and you're gonna have a werewolf jump out and scream?
[103:04.40]That's not a good idea.
[103:26.71]I can't wait for the next five sound effects.
[103:28.77]That's what this is.
[103:34.26]The funny sound effect.
[103:35.80]I can't wait for the funny sound.
[103:37.04]The next funny sound effect.
[103:38.30]Me either.
[103:58.43]Stop.
[103:58.67]You're gonna lose all your plus twos.
[104:01.31]Watch out.
[104:01.72]Watch it.
[104:02.16]It's gonna happen again.
[104:02.88]They're already gone.
[104:16.71]Market manipulation at its finest.
[104:38.48]This was a much better spot, though.
[104:39.49]It actually was.
[104:52.79]Come on!
[104:58.90]Somebody's freaking out over there?
[104:59.92]Yeah.
[105:01.14]It's alright.
[105:01.50]They're probably lagging.
[105:04.48]Fight it.
[105:05.14]It's right there.
[105:07.28]Talk to the guy across the river.
[105:11.05]Would you do something like that?
[105:12.09]Are you serious?
[105:14.95]That thing bobbed all the way down.
[105:17.46]If you were fishing, if you're the only person here, and that person was fishing, and you were fishing, and you were sitting there for like an hour or two straight, eventually don't you think you would be, you'd say like,
[105:30.99]catch anything or something like that just to lighten up the mood or something.
[105:36.51]I feel like somebody would do that.
[105:38.51]No.
[105:52.66]Not as big as the other one, but still alright.
[105:57.81]Yeah, you want to yell over there?
[105:58.87]Hey, did you see the werewolf?
[106:02.10]Put a boom box like in the bush over here.
[106:04.04]Hit play and run back over here.
[106:06.40]That's the equivalent of what I just did to you guys.
[106:19.71]And then run around like I'm scared.
[106:29.53]Person would just pick up the hit tackle box.
[106:32.22]And just move a hundred feet that way.
[106:47.30]What's a taco box?
[106:49.36]Tackle box.
[106:55.82]We already went over cheeses.
[106:59.95]My favorite cheese is Swiss cheese.
[107:06.18]That's unpopular, though.
[107:07.20]People don't like Swiss cheese.
[107:08.22]They think it just smells and is gross.
[107:11.50]Why?
[107:14.94]The same people that will eat Brie and talk about how Brie is the best will be angry that I said I like Swiss.
[107:21.61]They both stink.
[107:27.11]They both have, like, a very distinct flavor to them.
[107:29.29]Why... Why is your cheese better than my cheese?
[107:34.98]That thing's pretty big.
[107:37.53]Nine and a half inches.
[107:40.45]That's a big one.
[107:45.37]Brie cheese tastes like plastic.
[107:46.93]Brie cheese.
[107:48.13]I don't like Brie.
[107:51.63]I don't.
[107:52.35]I'm not a fan at all.
[108:10.88]This one's a big one.
[108:15.28]Wow.
[108:16.90]1.7 pounds.
[108:18.82]Almost 15 inches.
[108:19.86]$45.
[108:20.97]Keeping it.
[108:23.85]So I have a question.
[108:25.17]I feel like it's not hard to do this.
[108:30.41]I just hit right click and rip him out of the ocean.
[108:46.09]It's not hard to fish, Jerma.
[108:48.23]Don't say that.
[108:50.27]I said that like an hour ago and everybody told me I was a dumb person.
[109:14.75]What's that?
[109:17.11]There's actually a noise behind me.
[109:18.43]I'm not playing that.
[109:20.63]I'm not doing a werewolf thing again.
[109:24.68]Oh, it's you.
[109:34.02]I'm over that!
[109:43.63]What level am I at? 4?
[109:57.29]Something's right there.
[109:58.11]Come on.
[110:09.06]I'm still playing this.
[110:10.92]Yeah.
[110:14.30]That's alright.
[110:16.08]I'm having a good time.
[110:19.76]That's not a bite.
[110:20.64]That's just a little pulp.
[110:24.28]Come on.
[110:24.66]I feel like this is going to be a big one.
[110:29.45]Right there.
[110:29.85]Come on.
[110:30.19]Right there.
[110:30.52]Right there.
[110:30.80]Right there.
[110:31.06]Right there.
[110:31.32]Right there.
[110:31.62]Pull it down.
[110:31.98]Do it.
[110:36.02]Get that pet food.
[110:38.46]Oh, this is the good shit.
[110:46.44]Nice.
[110:46.72]Uh-oh.
[110:48.56]Impossible to place.
[110:49.36]Uh-oh.
[110:52.09]I can't take this one.
[110:53.25]I have a full bag.
[111:12.40]I think it might be time to go to another place.
[111:16.82]Sell.
[111:17.30]Sell.
[111:17.81]Is there... Wait, hold on.
[111:19.17]Can I just sell?
[111:27.21]Backpack.
[111:30.49]Fish keeper.
[111:31.03]Okay.
[111:32.13]How do I... Can I sell?
[111:33.37]Early morning.
[111:33.97]Early morning.
[111:34.57]Pet food.
[111:37.85]How do I... Can I sell?
[111:39.11]Specials.
[111:39.77]Licenses.
[111:40.47]Fish keeper.
[111:46.58]I don't think I can do anything else with this.
[111:48.51]Look at it in 3D?
[112:04.32]Yeah, I gotta release this thing.
[112:06.80]Alright, so we got one pound, one pound.
[112:09.29]I want at least another, at least one pound.
[112:15.21]yeah give me like another full pound catfish and we can go this is the good spot for the catfish right here this is a good one but what is that bird
[112:41.57]That is the most distinct bird I know what that is.
[112:44.01]Is it a chickadee?
[112:45.63]The one that goes... I hear... It's the only thing that they do.
[112:54.84]I gotta recast this.
[113:17.26]Oh, by the way.
[113:19.74]Louis Cheese.
[113:21.60]Louis Cheese.
[113:23.51]Louis Cheese.
[113:25.29]It's time for you to wake up.
[113:27.49]Louis Cheese.

[113:30.85]Wake up now.
[113:32.31]Louis Cheese.
[113:33.15]You guys were fucking early.
[113:44.87]I looked over here.
[113:45.53]I was going to do it in about 20-30 seconds because it was 1.54.30 is when I need to do it.
[113:48.99]You guys did it so early.
[113:59.41]He's here?
[113:59.79]Alright, good.
[114:01.61]You guys are giving this poor dude, you're giving like 5,000 dings.
[114:06.23]I hope this pro- yeah, this pro- if you have notifications, sounds on Twitch, I didn't even need to say anything.
[114:12.86]You guys just pinged him like fucking 6,000 times.
[114:18.61]He's probably gonna be screaming, holding his ears.
[114:34.44]Let me know when you start playing something entertaining.
[114:36.56]Uh, thanks.
[114:37.32]Yeah, what, uh... What's your name?
[114:44.44]What's your name?
[114:52.91]Who was that?
[114:53.51]Who said that?
[114:59.83]I need one more catfish, then we'll go somewhere else.
[115:08.59]No, we're not doing this.
[115:09.89]I hate the front desk at a hotel.
[115:12.15]I'm not going to... Hello, Mr. Albert Sinn, it's your 8 a.m.
[115:18.33]wake-up call.
[115:29.39]I've got to go back to the other one.
[115:37.77]Oh, what's going on?
[115:45.37]Uh-oh, the werewolf is coming back.
[115:52.61]Well, we're staying here.
[115:58.27]Thanks for recommending places in Boston to go.
[115:59.87]I had a great time.
[116:00.59]I'm glad you did.
[116:02.57]Boston's a great city.
[116:16.64]This stream's making people fall asleep, actually, so he needs to yell people's usernames to keep viewers up.
[116:20.66]That's whatever.
[116:24.19]What's the best burger in Boston?
[116:25.51]I don't know.
[116:26.69]I actually don't know the answer to that question.
[116:46.38]Best burger in Las Vegas.
[116:47.70]I got that one.
[116:48.56]You already know it.
[116:52.36]Somebody say it for me.
[117:02.61]Not Shake Shack.
[117:03.43]What?
[117:04.59]Hash House of Go-Go.
[117:13.75]Not McDonald's.
[117:16.03]Who?
[117:16.45]What?
[117:17.79]Wait, wait.
[117:18.90]There may be people here that were not here when I've talked about this before a few times.
[117:24.46]At the link, it's the name of a casino, it's a casino hotel, there is a restaurant.
[117:31.00]Inside of that restaurant is a little place that we like to call Hash House Ogogo.
[117:37.08]It is a 24-hour establishment, and inside there, there's an expansive menu of chicken, hamburger, waffles.
[117:51.06]24 hours.
[117:59.13]There is a burger on that menu, which I highly recommend.
[118:03.67]It is the blue cheese stuffed burger under the hamburger section.
[118:10.47]It is the best hamburger I have ever had in my entire life.
[118:19.29]Alright.
[118:20.31]We're on a fishing trip.
[118:21.91]Somebody's asleep.
[118:23.86]And no one's listening to me.
[118:24.78]I'm like so close to this person's ear telling them this.
[118:35.51]why am I turning like into like a castaway like Tom hanks right now I'm like losing my mind guy just wakes up dude what are you talking what's wrong what are you doing did anything I got any bites sorry I just I just I needed to like make sure you knew
[119:11.17]Inception.
[119:13.81]Everyone just asleep.
[119:14.83]I get up and I stand in front of them and I do a full, like, just presentation.
[119:23.57]I need to tell you this.
[119:24.69]It's so important.
[119:26.57]Hash House Ogogo.
[119:33.75]Bring your laptop.
[119:34.78]Oh, yeah.
[119:35.16]Open it up.
[119:44.30]I need one more fish and I can get out of here.
[119:53.67]But for real, the burger at Hash House A Go Go, in the link, is so good.
[120:02.85]I've not eaten a hamburger that was better than that in my life.
[120:08.46]L-I-N-Q, the link.
[120:14.30]Somebody eat this!
[120:33.57]Now, I can't speak.
[120:34.43]I know there are other Hash House of Go-Go's, but I cannot speak to the quality of the other ones.
[120:39.99]Whoever the executive chef is of the Las Vegas in the link.
[120:46.86]Chef.
[120:48.46]That's the one I'm speaking of.
[120:50.12]So if you go to Hash House of Go-Go in Florida or something, and you're like, this sucks.
[120:56.30]Well, you're not the right one.
[121:10.77]I just... I have to... Okay, I think my game's broken.
[121:14.31]I do.
[121:14.61]I think my game's broken.
[121:15.89]I need to go... Okay, finally, I can walk over here now.
[121:21.05]Do I like shellfish?
[121:22.93]I'm one of those weirdos that loves crab but hates lobster.
[121:27.79]It just seems impossible.
[121:29.40]It seems so stupid and impossible, but it's true.
[121:36.90]See, that's weird.
[121:38.31]Same, really.
[121:38.93]I was assuming people were going to think that was odd.
[121:47.77]Here we go.
[121:56.98]Crab takes a lot of work.
[121:59.70]Yeah, that's why I usually just have somebody do it for me.
[122:04.16]That's not big enough.
[122:05.61]That's not big enough.
[122:06.37]What do you mean?
[122:06.81]I can't keep this?
[122:07.39]Why?
[122:08.59]Didn't I throw away one?
[122:09.41]Oh, it's too much weight.
[122:12.13]I only have 4.4 pounds.
[122:14.55]I need a bigger fish hut.
[122:16.93]Damn it.
[122:18.21]Okay, that's what's going on.
[122:22.72]Fish hut medium.
[122:25.92]15 pounds.
[122:26.52]Alright.
[122:28.04]That's the problem.
[122:31.63]Wait a minute, I can't keep... Alright, I have to leave.
[122:33.13]I have to go back to my house.
[122:33.99]Alright, I'm out.
[122:36.46]Back to my house.
[122:41.82]King crab is my favorite... Probably my favorite seafood.
[122:46.13]King crab is salmon, but king crab is expensive.
[122:48.73]I can't really get it all the time.
[123:00.32]But it is... I love King Crab.
[123:03.94]Blue Crab.
[123:04.56]Blue Crab is good, but I... It has a different flavor profile for me.
[123:07.75]I'm not a huge fan of Blue Crab.
[123:09.19]Or, like, Dungeon Crab.
[123:11.35]I've had Dungeon Crab once, and it was strange.
[123:14.71]It was really... It was, like, a very ammonia-tasting... It was very weird.
[123:18.75]I didn't like it.
[123:25.08]Dungeon Crab.
[123:25.76]Is that... Am I... Dungeoness.
[123:27.48]Dungeon?
[123:27.84]Yeah.
[123:28.18]Yeah.
[123:31.53]Rocky Lake.
[123:32.09]I'll level my 4.
[123:34.71]Any 4s?
[123:40.51]Dungeon is crab is harbor trash?
[123:43.31]No, there's a really expensive crab that I really didn't like and I could barely eat it.
[123:52.71]Damn it.
[123:53.09]I need... What level do I need to be?
[123:54.13]Is there any 5s?
[124:01.53]What about Snow Crab?
[124:03.61]I don't know.
[124:05.13]Rocky Lake's the next one.
[124:07.33]I need to go home.
[124:07.87]Inventory.
[124:09.59]Alright, where's my stuff?
[124:11.43]Home.
[124:12.63]There we are.
[124:13.67]Mudspin 1200, get that on.
[124:16.02]Mono 007.
[124:19.66]I don't know.
[124:19.96]I have no idea.
[124:22.86]Can I put this on?
[124:24.72]Fish Hut Medium.
[124:25.90]Why can I not put this on?
[124:41.77]Do I like calamari?
[124:42.79]Only fried.
[124:47.61]I think it's just open some loot boxes.
[124:50.01]There are no loot boxes in this game.
[124:55.82]Is it just on?
[124:58.62]Or am I not allowed to use this yet?
[125:02.50]I think that's on, right?
[125:08.93]Well, whatever.
[125:09.37]I'm going to... Who likes cheese?
[125:13.31]Anybody in Lone Star like cheese?
[125:17.03]The Shiner.
[125:17.71]Doughballs.
[125:19.39]Doughballs.
[125:20.33]Pet food.
[125:20.87]Ooh.
[125:23.57]I'm going back to town.
[125:33.52]Let's see.
[125:33.94]Catfish.
[125:34.46]Right here.
[125:35.26]Pet food.
[125:35.84]Leeches.
[125:36.12]I have pet food right now.
[125:42.88]But yeah, king crab's my favorite.
[125:51.83]Holy shit, look at how misty it is.
[125:55.39]Now this is cool.
[126:00.49]I would go fishing like this.
[126:01.63]Uh-oh, he's queuing up the werewolf sound again.
[126:11.16]No, I'm not.
[126:12.59]Don't listen to these liars in chat.
[126:14.53]They're lying to you.
[126:20.82]You vape, we get it.
[126:21.78]Oh yeah, I still have to do that.
[126:24.26]I still have to do that thing that I was going to do a long time ago.
[126:29.52]Anybody remember that thing that I was going to do?
[126:33.06]I don't think any of you guys remember.
[126:34.35]Maybe I shouldn't talk about it then.
[126:36.97]It's just stupid.
[126:41.41]I remember.
[126:41.83]Alright, some people remember.
[126:42.71]They promise a lot of things.
[126:47.96]Yeah, I do.
[126:49.12]I don't promise anything.
[126:49.96]I just come up with ideas.
[126:52.36]And then I see -2, minus three.
[126:55.09]And then I go, ah, that's not a good idea.
[126:56.47]Maybe I should change my plans.
[127:11.88]Dr. Oz in the next Rumble.
[127:14.38]I know.
[127:15.12]You think I forgot?
[127:15.96]That's one of the most important new characters.
[127:20.86]How could I forget that?
[127:21.99]I don't invite?
[127:35.98]Nah.
[127:40.42]Did you wake up Louis Cheese?
[127:41.55]I did.
[127:47.33]I promised Ace Attorney.
[127:48.33]No, I didn't.
[127:49.47]I said I was going to check it out off stream and see if I wanted to stream it.
[127:52.15]And it turned out I did not want to stream it.
[127:55.49]I was very honest.
[128:12.09]Nothing over here.
[128:12.59]I'm changing spots.
[128:18.97]You promised you would start drinking wine instead of beer.
[128:22.49]I don't drink beer.
[128:26.41]I drink... For low alcohol content beverages for alcohol, I drink wine and... I drink red wine.
[128:36.65]Well, I don't drink beer.
[128:39.83]You guys have known that for almost two years.
[128:44.27]Fucking werewolf.
[129:04.02]What about high alcohol content?
[129:06.98]Good vodkas.
[129:09.90]Like high-quality vodkas.
[129:13.46]Not the fingernail polish removal.
[129:18.71]That's like four bucks for a handle.
[129:21.67]No.
[129:25.73]And scotches.
[129:29.34]I like whiskey.
[129:31.14]I don't drink it that much anymore, though.
[129:41.00]Crystal Skull, Dan Aykroyd, Vodka.
[129:43.12]Crystal Skull actually was pretty good.
[129:46.08]It was not bad.
[129:53.51]I didn't hate it.
[129:57.97]You know what I do want to get, though?
[130:00.53]I want to get Stone Cold's beer.
[130:05.95]What's it called?
[130:07.19]Stone Cold's beer.
[130:07.90]It's like Skull... Like Skull Crusher or something.
[130:13.04]It's called something.
[130:17.34]I want to try it.
[130:19.55]Broken Skull IPA.
[130:20.63]There it is.
[130:24.63]Has anybody had Broken Skull?
[130:27.35]I'm not a big beer drinker, but... I mean, I feel like it would be pretty good.
[130:35.38]It's really good.
[130:41.47]I have to put a new bait on.
[130:42.45]This is ridiculous.
[130:48.29]It's pretty good.
[130:48.73]I have to go.
[130:50.86]I'm gonna track it down.
[130:55.20]IPAs taste like a new carpet.
[131:05.99]Is there a certain, like, time of day should I put new bait on?
[131:22.72]Do I like it?
[131:23.88]That song always kind of jumps up on me.
[131:26.44]Alright, pet food's not doing it.
[131:29.02]Let's go back to worms.
[131:30.65]I need to get to level five.
[131:34.86]Can I buy a casting rod?
[131:36.40]I don't think I can.
[131:38.52]Rods.
[131:40.26]Value spin.
[131:41.30]Telefloat.
[131:42.12]Value spin.
[131:44.68]Is this a casting?
[131:45.24]That's a lot of money.
[131:45.84]I only have $2,100.
[131:52.42]Spinning rod?
[131:54.44]Value spin.
[131:59.00]Okay.
[131:59.44]Well, I own it.
[132:12.18]Is that Polish vodka?
[132:13.10]It's incredible.
[132:17.04]Yeah, there are some really good vodkas, there are.
[132:27.27]I worried about my sleeping schedule, but this stream fixed it.
[132:30.83]You're welcome.
[132:32.31]I'm glad I can be of service.
[132:40.17]I got a bluegill!
[132:46.46]Jerma, look at the game chat.
[132:50.89]You know, I've never once ever thought it was something that I was going to do or been told to pay attention to in game chat.
[133:03.77]I will take things that I've never thought of to do for 5,000, Alec.
[133:30.56]You guys couldn't press the -2 fast enough for that one.
[133:37.62]Well, that's good.
[133:44.08]Why am I trying to game minus twos?
[133:46.65]I should be trying to game plus twos.
[133:48.41]That's how it works, right?
[133:50.23]I have to balance it out.
[134:00.55]He's a Biden like crazy.
[134:04.19]Don't take this fish to avoid a hundred dollar fine.
[134:08.93]This is my backyard.
[134:10.17]What?
[134:20.46]Fish verification in progress.
[134:23.59]What?
[134:23.81]What?
[134:31.06]I don't have a license to be here?
[134:33.24]I thought I did.
[134:33.76]It's still the same day, isn't it?
[134:45.01]It's not a different state.
[134:49.40]Your license has a maximum.
[134:54.70]Isn't it the same day?
[134:56.12]Oh no, it's the next day.
[135:03.82]Well, I just need to get to level 5 and I can go to the next area.
[135:06.02]That's all I care about.
[135:21.27]Come here.
[135:25.95]You didn't verify that fish on Twitter.
[135:29.31]I'm not verified on Twitter.
[135:41.12]Like, my Twitter could be fake.
[135:45.59]I don't put anything there worth any real value to anybody.
[135:49.97]Besides the, like, stream starting message.
[136:03.65]Ooh, what's that?
[136:05.10]That's new.
[136:07.42]Blacktail Shiner.
[136:22.21]This used to be a mayonnaise stream.
[136:24.07]Well, that's like a 2014 reference.
[136:39.14]Whoa.
[136:43.18]That thing is big.
[136:45.60]Big but small.
[136:47.20]Wide but short.
[136:48.46]39 bucks.
[137:03.76]Worms are doing a good job today.
[137:17.65]There's a LARPer.
[137:23.62]Come on, we're almost there!
[137:25.10]How much money is it to go to the next area?
[137:26.66]I'm gonna move this way.
[137:29.18]I'm gonna get close to friends.
[137:33.61]What do you do with the fishes that you catch?
[137:34.61]You sell them.
[137:43.31]Okay.
[137:45.85]Are you fishing or are you like trying to get free television?
[137:54.32]Oh my God, that can't be real.
[138:02.38]That's a joke.
[138:03.91]This is- that's a radio tower.
[138:06.21]This is not a fishing pole.
[138:12.17]How do you cast this?
[138:18.09]I feel like the only way to cast this is if you spin in a circle for 5-10 straight seconds and then just let it go.
[138:24.57]Holy shit, that thing is big.
[138:47.91]Give me level 5.
[138:51.88]Wow.
[138:52.50]Remember what I said at the beginning of the stream?
[138:55.60]This is how it happens.
[138:56.40]10 minutes or 3 hours.
[139:01.44]Yep.
[139:04.04]We made it.
[139:13.51]Oh, a crappy...
[139:20.47]But why?
[139:21.07]I don't know.
[139:25.27]Sometimes it's nice just to talk to you guys.
[139:28.94]You know?
[139:29.56]Level five reached.
[139:31.02]Let's go.
[139:37.10]Rocky Lake, Colorado.
[139:38.38]I unlocked dough balls.
[139:41.30]Grub one.
[139:44.58]Slop spoon.
[139:47.04]Narrow spoon.
[139:47.74]Spinner.
[139:48.86]Flies.
[139:51.22]Oh, cool.
[139:51.68]I gotta... Okay, this is where the level... This is where the game really begins.
[139:53.96]Look at all this stuff.
[139:57.38]Open feeder.
[139:59.79]Alright, and then I wanna go back and, um... Inventory go home.
[140:03.67]I want my... I want my rod.
[140:05.43]I gotta go back to my house, right?
[140:11.01]I am in my house.
[140:11.65]196 bucks.
[140:17.70]Alright.
[140:17.90]Inventory.
[140:22.47]Where's the broad?
[140:28.60]Home.
[140:29.06]There we are.
[140:30.58]Okay, value spin.
[140:32.08]6-3.
[140:35.53]Item can be replaced only with item of the same type?
[140:40.29]What are you talking about?
[140:41.03]What does that mean?
[140:56.52]I'm already using this one?
[140:59.22]Oh, alright, shit.
[141:03.02]This is alright.
[141:04.96]Camo vest, fish hut, extra small.
[141:07.18]I think that I already have it on.
[141:09.38]Alright, I got it on, I have a new, the rod is on.
[141:13.66]I need a new hook.
[141:15.06]Shop.
[141:16.06]Wait, how much is it to go to Colorado?
[141:20.54]Rocky Lake.
[141:21.86]It's $2000 to go here, come on, and a license.
[141:28.39]I need 2600 bucks to go to Colorado.
[141:33.02]Damn it.
[141:33.48]Alright, I can do this.
[141:34.96]Let's just go back to Mud River.
[141:35.94]I still have a license.
[141:38.54]821, right?
[141:38.76]Let's go.
[141:40.64]1200 bucks to be there for a day.
[141:41.82]What?
[141:42.08]I just go here.
[141:53.83]I just need to make money.
[142:00.98]It's time to grind?
[142:01.97]No.
[142:02.21]I only need, like, five, six hundred bucks?
[142:09.33]It really is an MMO, isn't it?
[142:10.61]Yeah, it kind of is.
[142:11.47]Is this the new rod?
[142:18.58]I think this is the new rod.
[142:24.00]Hello. 45624562.
[142:32.46]Uh, the water's over here.
[142:34.12]I didn't even... I guess I caught that.
[142:49.96]This is gonna take a while.
[142:51.64]How do I make money fast?
[143:05.98]You can't.
[143:06.50]I just wanna see Colorado.
[143:15.98]Dammit, I gotta go back to throwing it.
[143:21.35]It's not the shore?
[143:22.09]I'm gonna go on the bridge.
[143:22.91]What's on there, worms?
[143:30.75]Yeah.
[143:32.27]I need money.
[143:34.13]Alright, I'm just going to fill my backpack.
[143:36.81]15 pawns.
[143:41.91]Shouldn't take long.
[143:44.58]It actually, it may take potentially like an hour.
[143:52.32]No, it won't.
[143:53.82]24 bucks.
[143:54.08]Alright, keep it.
[143:56.76]5, you know, 10, 20 more of those.
[144:03.51]Just buy it?
[144:04.67]No.
[144:06.58]I'm not hitting the free-to-play wall and climbing over it with a briefcase full of money.
[144:22.99]Yes, there's somebody standing here.
[144:24.61]There is.
[144:24.89]In case you didn't know.
[144:31.63]These things are so cheap.
[144:32.73]I need something bitter.
[144:36.62]Like an IPA.
[144:37.52]That sounds good to me.
[144:50.13]Something bigger.
[144:58.45]Hehe, I caught a fish.
[145:02.40]How do you do like a thumbs up?
[145:05.63]I guess, hold on.
[145:06.91]When in doubt, just do Homer Simpson.
[145:39.32]No!
[145:44.06]That's Homer Simpson.
[145:46.00]Sideways.
[145:46.86]Homer Simpson.
[145:50.49]Look, it's... Imagine Homer Simpson lying down on his bed.
[145:54.21]On his back.
[146:03.72]You can't see that?
[146:15.01]Bait was eaten.
[146:19.20]Hornwort?
[146:25.42]I wish there was in-game voice.
[146:27.42]I would be right behind this guy, and I would just turn on the voice, and I would go... And do it until he turned around.
[146:42.62]No more bait.
[146:51.64]Pet food.
[146:52.24]I want to catch one of the... Let me just check and see something here.
[146:57.68]Species.
[146:59.18]Channel catfish.
[147:00.50]Pet food.
[147:01.42]They're over here.
[147:04.14]Somewhere.
[147:07.48]Stay out of my spot.
[147:10.67]We can share.
[147:16.86]Look, you guys should be able to get along.
[147:18.54]You both shop at the same clothing store.
[147:24.40]In fact, so do I. And we should all be friends because we all go to the same store.
[147:32.73]We're all wearing the same, like, plaid shirts.
[147:35.37]Alright, I'm going this way.
[147:40.53]Get out of his spot.
[147:41.39]No, there is no my spot in this game.
[147:43.75]We share it as...
[147:45.86]A group of fishermen.
[147:54.84]This is definitely big enough for all of us to stay here.
[148:03.71]They both have those gigantic antennas.
[148:14.62]26 bucks.
[148:16.60]I have 1.7 pounds.
[148:17.70]There.
[148:28.05]This is my spot now.
[148:29.23]You don't have to complain about me being in your spot.
[149:24.43]Lots of drama in the planet fishing competitive community.
[149:28.16]That's a good one.
[149:47.69]Kick?
[149:48.43]You can't kick people.
[149:49.51]Do you think that that is a service available in this game?
[150:01.43]Now, kill him with kindness.
[150:32.00]See, like... No, why are they going over the lily pads?
[151:01.48]That's passive aggressive.
[151:15.09]You can pass time with tea.
[151:16.43]I waited an hour to remove the fog?
[151:19.01]What?
[151:20.43]No, you can't- Is that real?
[151:33.44]But what about everybody else on the server?
[151:35.76]This ain't working.
[151:36.48]This spot sucks.
[152:18.50]So we can... Are we getting $50?
[152:33.09]Oh, no, that means that they're watching.
[152:34.77]Oh, man.
[152:37.85]Okay, big bitch.
[152:41.51]Casted it back out.
[152:44.28]Oh, my God.
[152:45.77]Thank you, Shitty Viewbot, for the 5,000 bits.
[152:49.21]50 bucks.
[152:53.67]Big bits.
[152:55.41]Challenge the Toxic Fisher to a 1v1.
[152:57.92]You won't do it, I bet.
[153:00.04]Well, thank you, Shitty Viewbot, for the $50.
[153:02.02]It's a huge amount of money.
[153:04.32]And, um... They're probably watching the stream right now.
[153:07.10]In fact, they're right next to me.
[153:11.25]Uh...
[153:12.97]How about this?
[153:13.63]Whoever gets the next fish, whoever has the bigger fish, pound-wise, wins.
[153:22.40]Starting right now.
[153:29.18]I love the eye blinking.
[153:33.77]That's the kind of eye blinking that's like, motherfucker, I don't think you're gonna... Mm-hmm.
[153:40.33]If it gets a bigger fish, right?
[153:41.69]I fucking guarantee it's gonna be me.
[153:46.21]Fucking asshole.
[153:53.27]That was... That was going on inside of the head there.
[154:03.89]There's this place.
[154:06.71]At the Link... Casino Resort.
[154:11.30]Hash House of Go-Go.
[154:13.70]Some of the finest hamburgers you'll ever eat in your life.
[154:19.27]Tasty, juicy.
[154:22.53]Full of flavor.
[154:24.37]With a dash of Worcestershire sauce.
[154:55.34]There's no fish over here.
[155:00.16]There's no fish over here.
[155:01.56]I'm going back to your spot.
[155:13.33]Stop using the pet food.
[155:14.41]I want a catfish.
[155:16.74]They're over here.
[155:17.84]And they eat the pet food.
[155:18.56]It's their favorite food.
[155:30.19]Come on.
[155:38.28]That thing's fucking tiny.
[155:41.20]Oh, that's not even the same guy.
[155:42.16]That's not even the right guy.
[155:43.46]What I meant to say was that that's a good fish.
[155:55.55]Oh, my stomach.
[155:58.32]I thought he was coming to show I thought it was the guy going yeah look what I got here we go this is my time to shine look at this thing this thing is huge holy that's 10 inches 10 inches what do you got hold it up I just saw it on the line
[156:27.81]Did he throw it away?
[156:28.37]I think he threw it away.
[156:31.74]Disqualification.
[156:32.44]Automatic win.
[156:44.03]0.7 pounds.
[156:47.05]Where is it?
[156:48.33]Oh, it doesn't say.
[156:48.89]0.2.
[156:50.34]Did you get something?
[157:01.69]I'm waiting.
[157:05.63]0.748, 10.1 inches.
[157:07.03]We'll see it.
[157:07.57]You can't lie.
[157:08.99]This game has a kill feed.
[157:12.63]A fish feed.
[157:13.21]Alright, we know what I got.
[157:31.24]He's telling the truth.
[157:32.68]Alright, fine.
[157:33.38]Did he actually win that first round?
[157:34.82]Because this is round two out of three.
[157:41.63]Scroll up the chat.
[157:45.93]How do you scroll up?
[157:49.37]I can't.
[157:52.71]I'm watching his stream, yes.
[157:58.07]He's got a better pole than me, though.
[158:00.05]He's got a bigger pole.
[158:01.21]He's got a more... Like, he's got more experience in the game.
[158:04.01]Alright, this is it.
[158:06.67]What do you got?
[158:10.47].97 pound trophy bluegill.
[158:12.81].66 pound sunfish.
[158:16.86]Well, how long was it, though?
[158:25.82]smaller fish yeah well I we're not using the same rods what do you mean no change in the rules this is like having a boxing match but I don't have to put on boxing gloves that's not fair that person's gonna beat the shit out of the other person
[158:54.13]If we're in a competition, why do you have to wear boxing gloves?
[158:58.77]But I don't.
[158:59.59]I can just punch you with my hands.
[159:14.86]Boxing gloves protect the hand, not the other person's.
[159:17.08]It doesn't protect the other person's face.
[159:24.60]Do you see what I'm getting at here?
[159:26.40]No, I'm saying without the boxing gloves, if a boxer punches somebody in the face, it's going to do like damage.
[159:38.84]Boxing gloves are worn to make it so they don't like, they don't do damage.
[159:55.45]What do you guys think boxing gloves are for?
[160:09.96]For boxing?
[160:12.14]Is he showing me his fish?
[160:14.46]I'm not paying attention.
[160:45.57]I must have been thinking of... I'm sorry, guys.
[160:47.81]Let me correct myself.
[160:48.59]I must have been thinking of sock-em-boppers.
[160:50.77]That's what I was thinking of.
[160:51.89]Wrong thing.
[160:52.45]Wrong sport.
[160:59.18]He got one.
[160:59.86]What is it?
[161:00.56]A .2 pound.
[161:02.70].29 pound.
[161:05.08]I can do better than that.
[161:41.14]That's so fucked up.
[161:58.21]Soccer shoes are for protecting the feet.
[162:02.19]How come you don't just walk around barefoot?
[162:05.67]It's nice work.
[162:19.89]He didn't win.
[162:20.45]I need to catch something.
[162:34.37]He won twice.
[162:35.99]Yeah, well, I get to win.
[162:38.87]I get to win because it's my stream.
[162:40.55]I get to win.
[162:41.01]It's my stream.
[162:53.41]He went on his stream.
[162:55.10]Yeah, so now I get to go on my stream.
[163:01.30]I'm just going both hands just... Into the water.
[163:06.76]Fuck, I missed my time.
[163:23.75]What's he got?
[163:24.09]Uh-oh.
[163:31.48]Let me see.
[163:33.38]0.5.
[163:33.44]I can do so much better than this.
[163:34.38]I'm just not getting distracted by talking about how boxing gloves hurt more or something.
[163:39.43]I don't even remember what it was.
[164:04.39]Come on, why are they getting stuff and not me?
[164:06.52]I gotta take the pet food off.
[164:10.48]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[164:11.32]Here it is.
[164:14.90]Oh, this is a big one.
[164:16.40]This is a big one.
[164:17.44]This thing is fucking huge.
[164:18.54]Look at that thing.
[164:21.45]Don't break the line.
[164:22.03]This is the biggest fish in the whole fucking lake.
[164:32.01]Too much tension.
[164:36.14]No, no, no, no.
[164:36.96]Look at this thing.
[164:37.46]It's like a whale.
[164:45.13]Come here.
[164:47.47]Come here.
[164:51.17]Can he grab onto my hips and pull me forward?
[164:55.32]It's getting away.
[165:02.38]Come on.
[165:06.95]It's right there.
[165:13.56]Where is it?
[165:15.16]Holy shit.
[165:32.01]Three and a half pounds.
[165:34.90]18 inches long.
[165:35.56]That's a smallmouth buffalo.
[165:37.86]81 bucks.
[165:38.56]You got it.
[165:41.61]Let's take a look.
[165:42.17]Take a look.
[165:44.33]That's as big as we are tall.
[165:46.37]Let me stand back.
[166:00.14]You win.
[166:00.88]Winner is you.
[166:01.92]Yeah.
[166:06.19]I lost the first two.
[166:07.09]It's okay.
[166:08.73]Keeping this one.
[166:09.31]Let's go back to back.
[166:21.74]Throw it at him.
[166:22.58]No.
[166:43.34]Why is that not?
[166:44.44]It's only supposed to be like five up.
[166:50.82]Oh, come on.
[166:51.94]It's supposed to only be five up.
[166:53.73]Give me a break.
[166:54.39]Is something on here?
[167:17.13]Doesn't even need to try!
[167:18.11]I'm so happy about that big- it was- this was worth the three hours in this game.
[167:33.05]New pawn, new pawn.
[167:33.89]I need- I don't have any money, I need more money.
[167:46.35]Is it worth another three hours?
[167:49.31]I don't think so.
[167:51.39]But I'm not giving up yet.
[167:52.83]Not until we get to the new pond.
[168:00.62]I'm not going anywhere.
[168:01.50]What's the name of this game?
[168:05.86]It's called Fishing Planet, I think.
[168:10.04]Planet Fish.
[168:11.20]One of those two.
[168:11.90]Just type in Fishing.
[168:14.59]Fishing Planet.
[168:19.71]Why the second one?
[168:29.85]Nothing.
[168:33.45]I feel like the spot was right here.
[168:38.16]I'm not going to play a Dance Dance Revolution game.
[168:41.40]That's not going to happen.
[168:43.08]Sorry to get everybody's hopes up, but I'm not going to play that game on stream.
[168:51.59]You can go ahead.
[168:52.07]You can riot.
[168:52.55]That's fine.
[168:52.91]It's not going to happen.
[168:57.69]And if I ever did it, I would be sober.
[169:16.89]Alright.
[169:17.87]34.
[169:18.41]How much money am I... I'm going to fill the backpack.
[169:24.93]You couldn't dance sober.
[169:27.17]Actually, I do know how to dance fairly well.
[169:30.77]And not like, not like, oh, look, a jokey, I'm wearing a fat suit yesterday.
[169:36.86]No.
[169:37.76]With the right beat, I can move.
[169:45.42]That's not a lie.
[169:46.22]That's for real.
[169:50.10]With the right beat, I can move.
[169:53.30]I'm hitting my body.
[169:54.42]My legs can spin around.
[170:00.45]Nobody does the finger snaps anymore.
[170:03.15]That needs to come back.
[170:05.85]The wrist and the elbow go down.
[170:08.46]Bang.
[170:09.52]Bang.
[170:10.60]Bang.
[170:10.80]Why did that go out of style?
[170:43.04]Hasn't yet.
[170:43.48]I'm still waiting for you boomers to move on.
[170:47.76]No.
[170:51.30]Go look at the green screen dancing.
[170:52.98]Remember when I was moving my legs around like bang!
[170:56.51]Bang!
[170:57.77]I was doing some leg snaps.
[171:00.05]Go watch the full screen green screen dancing and you tell me that that was bad.
[171:16.79]You did one good clip.
[171:18.47]Oh, only one?
[171:20.69]It was like four.
[171:30.24]You did dad dancing.
[171:31.76]No, I did not.
[171:35.14]Dad dancing is two fists up.
[171:40.28]Your left hand goes slightly above.
[171:42.23]Look, I'll just show you.
[171:45.49]This is the dad dance.
[171:47.49]It's like this.
[171:48.91]Two fists, one hand is slightly above the other one, and it's up-down like this.
[171:58.50]That's the dad dance.
[172:02.10]I used to film weddings, I know.
[172:13.51]Why do I have grandma hair?
[172:20.69]Because I fucking want it.
[172:42.18]Did you get paid to film weddings or did you just... What?
[172:44.40]You act like I'm just like filming a wedding that I'm... What are you talking about?
[172:49.64]Why would I do that?
[172:51.31]Yes, it was a service that I was hired to do.
[172:54.25]Alright.
[173:16.47]You kind of look like a creep, to be honest.
[173:22.25]kind of like what kind of comment is that that's a comment that I would remove typically I'm gonna remove that comment I'm gonna remove that one I think no it's already gone it's alright
[173:59.37]You only read mean messages.
[174:01.23]It's because they put a fish next to it, or they put it in red text.
[174:27.18]Alright, I'm almost... I gotta...
[174:29.33]This ain't working.
[174:30.07]I gotta move.
[174:31.39]I wanna go to a spot that I haven't gone to before, like over here.
[174:47.15]There we go.
[174:49.57]Filactory Lich just gave four Gifted Subs.
[174:56.11]Thank you, Phylactery.
[174:56.75]If you missed last night, Phylactery gave an absolute shitload of money on top of this.
[175:02.37]And it looks like we're getting part two of that.
[175:06.56]There's 20 more from Phylactery Lich.
[175:09.74]20 more community subs.
[175:13.40]That was 24.
[175:17.35]Which makes 420.
[175:18.35]There you go.
[175:21.15]Ha ha ha!
[175:24.58]I get it.
[175:26.28]It's been fulfilled, yes.
[175:28.06]Thank you so much, though, for those community subs.
[175:30.26]It's a lot of subs.
[175:33.89]20, 4, 420.
[175:35.57]What am I, what's going on?
[175:36.29]Is this a big one?
[175:40.81]I think I got stuck on a lily pad.
[175:46.90]Wait, pull this back.
[175:52.32]What is this?
[175:52.82]I don't even... How am I doing this?
[175:57.02]What the fuck?
[175:58.32]How did I do that?
[176:02.24]I can do a super cast.
[176:03.46]That didn't even go that far.
[176:04.79]What?
[176:11.61]I'm missing something here.
[176:18.01]Okay.
[176:25.37]Am I not gonna aim up?
[176:29.53]I can't.
[176:32.91]That doesn't work.
[176:39.43]Why is there a cat?
[176:45.80]Got it.
[176:46.04]Okay, $29.
[177:06.06]Where'd it go?
[177:06.38]Why do I even do that when I can just do this?
[177:14.99]It goes further.
[177:24.56]Can we get another blue cheese burger ad, please?
[177:36.64]Fishing level almost level 6.
[177:41.66]Run adds.
[177:45.66]No.
[177:47.02]Not with 4,000 people here.
[178:00.39]How do you do the long cast?
[178:01.67]If you have the right...
[178:05.05]Ooh.
[178:06.65]You hold right... Ooh, bugs.
[178:08.91]Okay.
[178:09.73]Alright, what's that?
[178:10.75]Red with honey.
[178:11.33]Alright, I got some new stuff here.
[178:19.48]Nah, no ads.
[178:23.97]Get into 15 pounds and hope that's enough money.
[178:31.96]New lake?
[178:32.96]I'm trying.
[178:33.46]I need to get to 15 pounds so I can sell all my fish.
[178:45.31]Answer their question.
[178:46.01]What do you mean?
[178:46.57]What question?
[178:50.13]What was it?
[178:50.59]Somebody in here?
[178:51.33]Who said something?
[178:59.30]Don't get stuck in the tree.
[179:00.08]Alright, these are all 35, 35, 35.
[179:01.20]They might be enough.
[179:11.43]How did I forget that fast?
[179:12.51]I don't know.
[179:12.93]There's like three or four things going on at the same time.
[179:18.18]I forgot.
[179:18.58]I did.
[179:18.96]I have no idea what's going on.
[179:19.78]What happened?
[179:20.18]What happened?
[179:28.50]Hydrate from the pond.
[179:32.49]Okay, you hold right click and then you press left click if you have the right bow, the right rod.
[179:39.96]That's a $36 fish right there.
[179:41.50]11.2 pounds, I can do like three or four more.
[180:00.01]But it kind of sucks.
[180:01.35]I couldn't get it to work.
[180:13.02]That's a big one.
[180:14.50]Don't take this fish.
[180:17.58]I'll take a... Sorry, I'll take a $44 fine.
[180:19.46]Verifying... Whatever.
[180:29.27]I still get to keep it.
[180:43.46]What was the thing that we were talking about before?
[180:45.26]I forget what it was.
[180:57.66]It was not the best ice cream.
[180:58.94]Oh, ads, right.
[180:59.72]Yeah, I'm not gonna run ads.
[181:01.72]Because when you run an ad... If I were to do like three minutes of ads right now, 1,500 people would probably leave.
[181:22.03]Try it.
[181:22.82]No, I don't run ads on my stream.
[181:26.23]This is an ad-free viewing experience.
[181:29.89]I can't control when you come to the stream if you get a pre-roll, but this is an ad-free viewing experience.
[181:36.27]I don't run ads, ever.
[181:52.71]My default dance.
[181:56.85]How much money do I make if I run an ad?
[181:58.51]I have no idea.
[182:00.36]I don't have any... I have no gauge to tell you that.
[182:04.80]I don't do it, so I can't really tell you.
[182:10.90]Uh... He gave us ads during Terraria.
[182:20.66]Yeah, as a joke.
[182:22.80]Alright, the fish are all gone in here.
[182:28.41]You guys stole them all.
[182:39.25]Right here.
[182:40.45]Right in the lilies.
[182:41.81]Right in the lilies.
[182:42.41]No.
[182:44.45]This is also a joke ad.
[182:46.85]You literally caught the three sunfish I need one of.
[182:51.23]I'm sorry.
[182:51.83]Whoa, you got a two pounder.
[182:53.33]Oh no, that's not you.
[183:01.88]What would you rate this game?
[183:28.47]Come back to me in like 20 more minutes.
[183:30.43]I have to deliberate on this one.
[183:43.11]Four.
[183:49.63]But.
[183:51.03]But, but, but, but, but, but.
[183:58.23]It gets two and a half extra points.
[184:03.02]Full on that meter.
[184:06.18]For being relaxing.
[184:07.66]So it's a 4.2 out of 10.
[184:13.43]but it turns into like a 6.8 6.6 that's a good one 6.65 because I could see like two or three of my friends just hanging out just catching fish and comparing how big they are it's free
[184:41.49]It's free to just do what I'm doing right now.
[184:44.37]There's no reason to not at least try it if you wanted to play a fishing game.
[184:48.41]Whatever, it's just here.
[184:49.35]Using increments of a thousand.
[185:02.84]What, 6.65?
[185:05.63]That's increments of a hundred.
[185:08.13]So yeah, it's a 665.
[185:20.75]It's a, it's a 441 without the extra 2.2 percentage, 2.2, 221, whatever, of friend interaction points.
[185:34.00]You get it.
[185:34.38]And it's free.
[185:37.30]You're messing me up with this whole hundred point scale right now.
[185:45.79]This thousand point hundreds, hundreds of a decibel, uh, denomination.
[185:53.52]It's a 4 out of 10 with 2.6 extra points of friend and free interaction.
[186:18.58]Just say 7 out of 10.
[186:19.56]I wouldn't give this a 7 out of 10.
[186:22.42]Mm-mm.
[186:31.24]It's... Point scales are dumb anyways.
[186:39.10]Do you know why?
[186:39.60]Because everybody's afraid to give any game a rating.
[186:48.50]You give a game, like, a 6, and you anger a bunch of people.
[186:52.12]You give a game, like, a 9, and you anger a bunch of people.
[186:56.85]Everyone's terrified to rate anything that's not a 7.5 to like an 8.8.
[187:03.61]Star made a whole video on this.
[187:09.61]That video is, I will go down in history saying that I think that is the best YouTube video ever made.
[187:17.98]That is the best video game related YouTube video.
[187:20.94]I'm just going to say it.
[187:21.56]I think it is.
[187:33.59]The everything is an 8 out of 10 star video, I think is... It's got some great comedy points on it.
[188:01.75]No, no, I said no.
[188:03.23]No, no, no, no, no.
[188:11.16]Everyone needs to like what I like.
[188:13.58]Anger face.
[188:26.78]Can I please catch one more fish?
[188:28.26]I gotta put the worms back on.
[188:30.36]I got like three or four in a row and I haven't seen any.
[188:34.80]Pay-per-view.
[188:35.30]Would you guys watch a pay-per-view stream?
[188:40.13]Just curious.
[188:42.69]If it was like $12 to watch a stream, would you do it?
[188:50.07]Not like me playing fishing.
[188:56.50]What if it was like Jerma Rumble Live 2 and they were like five WWF superstars in it?
[189:04.20]And I promised that I was going to take a chair hit in the face.
[189:09.78]Like you knew at some point during that stream I was going to take a real chair shot to the face.
[189:15.13]For real.
[189:15.57]And I would like train and practice and do it.
[189:33.25]No, I would never do something like that.
[189:34.43]Didn't they just recently did the sub streams, right?
[189:38.53]I would never do that.
[189:42.03]Ever.
[189:43.03]I can't think of one reason to do it.
[189:44.37]Maybe, no, I can't.
[189:46.11]It's hard to think of a reason why.
[189:49.95]If you do a sub only stream, that stream is just going to be restreamed on YouTube on like 500 accounts.
[190:00.70]It's just, how are you going to stop that?
[190:06.90]You alienate and annoy a huge amount of your audience, a majority of your whole audience.
[190:12.15]And it doesn't even matter anyways because somebody is just going to clip it and put it somewhere else.
[190:26.88]Use it as a prank.
[190:35.60]The way I see it, it's like maybe a private creative stream, like a review mentorship thing.
[190:41.12]Yeah, I honestly, I forget about sub only streams.
[190:45.74]Why not?
[190:46.96]I mean, maybe is a bandwidth a concern?
[190:49.90]No.
[190:50.68]Anybody can just stream on Twitch.
[190:51.72]Why not have password streams?
[190:55.82]Or just, you know, that would be, right?
[191:00.20]Instead of sub only, why not do password protected streams?
[191:04.26]It's kind of the same thing, isn't it?
[191:18.11]The password is sub.
[191:21.31]Password stream could have use.
[191:22.41]Yeah, you could do like company.
[191:23.85]Well, I think Discord really is starting to drop this whole thing here, right?
[191:29.32]With doing private streams.
[191:32.92]It used to be, this is now, here's a story for you.
[191:34.88]Back in the day, and I'm talking maybe like six, seven, eight years ago.
[191:39.36]If you wanted to, we used to do this thing where somebody would screen share on Skype.
[191:45.29]We'd have a group call going, and we were always begging, begging and hoping for a solution just to have kind of a private session where three or four people can just watch.
[191:57.00]It was horrible quality.
[191:58.80]It was really, really delayed.
[192:00.08]It was really shitty.
[192:01.26]It wasn't very good.
[192:03.34]Discord is doing that now.
[192:05.18]And then Steam brought in the streaming too, but it was super delayed as well.
[192:12.10]A password protected stream on Twitch is kind of that same deal, like a screen share.
[192:20.85]I have not caught a fish in probably 35 minutes.
[192:22.19]Something's not, something's wrong.
[192:42.62]But substreams, I... They just kind of make a lot of people angry.
[192:54.31]I think there's one way where that works.
[192:57.45]And it's really, really bad.
[192:58.95]Honest to God, I think the only way that that really works if you wanted to do it is permanently turn it on.
[193:08.12]It's awful, and I think that's a really, really terrible idea, but...
[193:13.54]What, are you going to turn it on half the time?
[193:23.87]You would never get new viewers.
[193:26.19]No, but if you're going to go all in on something like that, you're going to go all in on that.
[193:31.45]I don't think you can kind of do that.
[193:33.15]Like, ooh, should I?
[193:33.89]I think you either go all in or you don't.
[193:35.59]Alright, finally.
[193:40.72]There it is.
[193:41.92]Thousand bucks.
[193:43.80]Alright, but I want a full bag.
[193:47.84]Have it as a Patreon reward?
[193:49.08]That makes sense too, maybe.
[194:07.73]What's my Discord?
[194:09.13]Do, uh, exclamation Discord.
[194:10.85]You'll find the link.
[194:11.85]It's public.
[194:12.99]Anybody can join it.
[194:15.26]Anybody can use it.
[194:20.10]That's a pretty good one.
[194:21.52]You already make thousands a month from subs and bits.
[194:25.90]I think that's kind of the point, too, though.
[194:27.71]If you have a bunch of subs, and you're doing well on Twitch, you're doing good on Twitch, I feel like that's too dainty.
[194:38.47]Why would you do that?
[194:39.21]It's kind of dainty.
[194:40.28]I think I'll turn that on.
[194:41.40]You don't really need to do that.
[194:44.74]It's not going to gain you any more money, if that's what you're after.
[194:47.47]I don't think that would work.
[194:52.97]I think that's how you lose money.
[195:01.78]If money is what you're after, there are other avenues to do that.
[195:14.23]Alright, 14 points for you.
[195:15.29]I'm done.
[195:16.01]No, I can get one more.
[195:17.31]One more small one.
[195:37.28]Some streamers do sub gate on video playbacks, like on their streams.
[195:41.97]Like on the past broadcasts.
[195:46.06]I would never turn that on because if a new viewer comes to your channel and wants to know what you're about, they either have the second that they are currently watching, which we've talked about like shitting our diapers before, and that person then has to have a conscious decision to go, oh, is there anything else that this guy has here that I can like see if I want to watch this or not?
[196:06.14]Having VODs let somebody go back and pick something that they may think is interesting and maybe they'll stick around.
[196:12.26]Maybe they'll go, oh, that was cool.
[196:13.90]I like that stream.
[196:14.72]That was a fun stream or something, right?
[196:17.65]When you have a sub gate on a past broadcast or on video highlights for Twitch or something, you are banking completely on the fact that you are going to be that second that that person comes to the stream is all you got.
[196:41.75]okay keep it 15 point alright alright alright I've got I'm good I'm good time to end the day I got how much money do I got 4200 we're good
[196:59.47]People who aren't subbed can't catch up on streams either with it.
[197:02.63]Well, that's true too.
[197:03.65]Like, let's say you subscribe for like three or four months, and then you unsubscribe, you know, for whatever reason.
[197:10.91]No one is ever obligated to subscribe to anybody's channel.
[197:14.71]So if you're subbed for a few months and you have, you know, you're not watching every single stream, you have a, oh, I'm subbed, now I can actually see the other content if you wanted to watch it.
[197:22.46]If you aren't subbed anymore after three, four, five months, two months, even one month, whatever, you lose access to the thing that you had before.
[197:31.22]And it's, I mean, I guess that kind of, that's, you know, I just want everybody to be able to see stuff that we've already done.
[197:41.44]I don't want to put a paywall up for stuff that's already been done.
[197:51.00]I need a license here.
[197:53.22]One day license in Colorado.
[198:02.67]$2,000 to go here.
[198:03.87]This is such a joke.
[198:04.71]Wait, wait, what's in here?
[198:05.55]Alright.
[198:13.19]Black crappy.
[198:14.33]Marshmallows.
[198:15.05]Have I unlocked marshmallows?
[198:16.34]Preferred lords.
[198:17.26]Hold on.
[198:17.96]I need a nanospooner.
[198:20.82]Nanospooners, nanospoons.
[198:22.42]Nanospoons.
[198:24.16]Nanospoons.
[198:24.92]Do I have a nanospoon?
[198:37.29]Nano spoon.
[198:41.23]What do they like to eat?
[198:42.63]Marshmallows.
[198:45.47]I can't buy them.
[198:48.62]Is there a spoon, um... thing here?
[198:55.58]Am I just, am I dumb?
[198:58.28]Oh, I am, okay, there is more.
[199:01.92]Open feeder now, it'll be under lures.
[199:04.82]Alright, spoon.
[199:06.46]Nano spoon.
[199:09.22]I think I have to... There are 48 pages.
[199:11.94]Nano... Nano spoon.
[199:16.49]Nano spinner.
[199:18.85]Nano spinner.
[199:19.83]Nano spinner, spinner, spinner.
[199:21.77]Nano spoons, but I'm not old enough for that.
[199:27.26]Nano spinner.
[199:28.04]I guess I'll get this one.
[199:30.74]Which one looks coolest?
[199:33.08]I'll get the... I'm gonna get the Spider-Man one.
[199:37.38]Okay, barbless nano spinner.
[199:40.93]Okay.
[199:43.95]And what food?
[199:50.69]Marshmallows, maggots, crickets, maggots.
[199:56.12]Alright, it's live.
[199:57.32]We're gonna get crickets and maggots.
[200:05.37]Where are the crickets?
[200:07.27]Crickets, here we go.
[200:08.67]It's got- I don't- I can't- It's gotta be- It's gotta be crickets.
[200:12.15]Maggots are not old enough.
[200:17.39]Okay.
[200:18.57]Alright.
[200:20.91]Alright.
[200:24.41]New rod.
[200:25.07]Oh, what do we got?
[200:27.25]Kreek Pro 8?
[200:29.73]The Omni Float.
[200:31.07]Value Spin.
[200:31.84]The Elemental 6-7.
[200:35.77]Mm-hmm.
[200:38.50]Think so.
[200:39.02]1700.
[200:39.06]Put it on.
[200:44.08]Where's my inventory?
[200:51.19]Okay.
[200:53.61]Glowing pear-shaped float.
[200:54.71]Where's my... Um... Horned Warp.
[201:00.69]Where's the...
[201:04.37]Home storage, okay.
[201:06.01]The Telefloat.
[201:08.01]Elemental.
[201:11.69]Alright.
[201:12.85]Nice.
[201:14.57]Barbless spinner?
[201:16.11]Reel must be equipped first.
[201:19.05]Is it not equipped?
[201:22.73]Oh, put the reel on.
[201:26.13]Get that barbless spinner on there.
[201:29.01]Line must be equipped.
[201:29.97]Oh, will you fuck off.
[201:30.85]262, got it.
[201:36.16]Line must be equipped.
[201:36.94]I just did.
[201:37.50]Right there.
[201:40.94]209.
[201:41.90]Backpack is full.
[201:42.64]What's happening here?
[201:45.74]What's going on?
[201:48.44]Oh, please.
[201:50.24]Alright.
[201:52.59]I have it here.
[201:55.97]Backpack is full.
[201:57.19]How is my backpack full?
[202:02.37]That's a slop spoon.
[202:03.47]I don't want the slop... I have five of these?
[202:06.85]Why do I have five of these?
[202:15.23]There we are.
[202:18.63]Terminal Tackle Weight.
[202:24.33]Alright, let's go.
[202:30.77]Rocky Lake, one day past 2,000 bucks.
[202:55.46]Colorado.
[202:57.82]This route is probably cool though.
[203:01.53]Let's take a look.
[203:02.87]I only need, like, 100 bucks.
[203:06.28]Look at this beauty.
[203:09.22]This thing is a beauty.
[203:11.98]Alright, what we got on here for bait?
[203:14.57]It's all we know.
[203:15.11]We don't use bait.
[203:16.41]This is just this thing.
[203:17.27]I would love it.
[203:19.23]I would love it if it just snapped.
[203:20.45]If it just broke.
[203:24.07]That's a nice rod.
[203:25.39]Nice new rod.
[203:27.56]That went very far.
[203:31.66]The whole lake.
[203:33.89]What does that mean?
[203:36.61]I need to keep it somewhere floating around like Flappy Bird, right?
[203:39.28]I can't let it touch anything?
[204:01.45]Wait, why is everybody saying -2?
[204:13.14]Flappy bird?
[204:19.51]I didn't even know there was somebody on there.
[204:36.56]That's far.
[204:37.42]Alright, slow.
[204:45.82]Stop and go, what does that mean?
[204:50.23]Stop and go.
[204:54.77]Oh, I think somebody's on it.
[204:57.11]Is that what that means?
[204:57.83]Oh, somebody's on it, somebody's on it.
[205:06.55]Somebody's on this.
[205:09.11]I think this is a big one.
[205:15.81]Oh, that is a big one.
[205:16.85]That's a spotted bass.
[205:20.14]$100 fine.
[205:26.84]Nice, that thing's out.
[205:28.60]Okay, I've done this three times.
[205:32.60]Am I gonna be three for three and getting in trouble?
[205:37.59]Yeah, what is the percentage?
[205:40.81]That seems like a really high percentage chance to get arrested for it.
[205:58.11]It's definitely more than one out of three.
[206:00.67]It's probably like a 10% chance to get that.
[206:13.52]Anybody?
[206:17.94]Stop and go.
[206:21.44]Stop and go.
[206:24.74]Okay.
[206:28.98]Come on.
[206:32.38]Somebody get on that.
[206:36.26]Stop and go.
[206:52.34]Is there anything on this?
[207:00.50]I can't believe that Disney and Sony did not come to an agreement for Spider-Man.
[207:07.34]That's fucking unbelievable to me.
[207:25.21]It's turning into a podcast.
[207:40.00]Big whoop.
[207:40.92]50th superhero in five years.
[207:42.60]Yeah, but the... Okay.
[207:45.12]Those Spider-Men... Get the fuck over here.
[208:03.18]Alright, 13 bucks.
[208:04.06]How much do I need?
[208:08.30]Far From Home is my favorite Marvel movie.
[208:12.90]It just is.
[208:14.34]Homecoming was very, very, very good too.
[208:16.79]I think the two Spider-Man movies in the MCU are the best.
[208:20.59]Out of the entire... All of them.
[208:22.45]Combined.
[208:32.83]Homecoming sucked?
[208:33.83]What?
[208:36.55]Michael Keaton.
[208:37.77]Michael Keaton is in that movie.
[208:39.82]It's automatically, it's like, Michael Keaton being in a movie is the same way I feel about when a car is drivable in a video game.
[208:46.40]It becomes a full letter grade higher.
[208:49.69]I am sorry, that is, I will take that all the way to the bank.
[209:06.32]Spider-Verse is better.
[209:07.58]Spider-Verse is... I'm talking like the Spider-Man MCU movies.
[209:11.69]Into the Spider-Verse was great.
[209:16.83]But I'm talking live-action Spider-Man.
[209:18.59]There was somebody on that.
[209:27.42]Spider-Verse was Sony Pictures.
[209:30.34]Yeah, but that... The amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2 was also Sony.
[209:39.79]And, yeah, you go back to the Sam Raimi movies.
[209:43.09]That was Sam Raimi.
[209:46.71]That wasn't, you know, Sony.
[209:55.68]Easy, easy.
[209:59.56]Big one?
[210:07.55]Alright, if Sam Raimi comes back and does Spider-Man for the next Sony movie, maybe we'll see.
[210:13.11]But that is not going to happen.
[210:15.55]You all know it.
[210:24.62]Get over here.
[210:25.80]What is this thing?
[210:26.74]Ooh.
[210:27.90]Illegal?
[210:29.24]This one's illegal as well.
[210:42.32]This would be 4 for 4.
[210:50.63]I'm losing money, and I'm trying to gain 100, 200 dollars.
[211:19.96]The article said that the director and Tom Holland are still going to be doing the next two planned Spider-Man films.
[211:24.32]They'll mess it up somehow.
[211:35.07]Not those two.
[211:41.37]You don't have all the other production in the Marvel Studios teams.
[211:46.63]Takes more than a director and an actor to make a movie.
[211:56.58]Is anybody on this?
[211:57.80]No.
[212:07.31]I want more Taskmaster.
[212:10.26]They have to explore more of these interesting characters.
[212:30.89]Mysterio was just one of those insanely interesting characters.
[212:37.63]I'm so happy that at least that last one was Mysterio.
[212:41.23]It was fucking awesome.
[212:51.50]No, no, no spoilers.
[212:53.14]If anybody says a spoiler, they're fucking gone.
[212:54.61]This is a great character.
[213:15.09]I loved every second of that movie.
[213:18.99]Vulture was, fuck, Michael Keaton, man, like, God.
[213:28.22]I wanted uh hear me out on this one when I found out that Michael keaton was going to be in a spider-man movie I shit my pants I remember I was driving my car and I was just driving along and I was on the radio there's just in uh uh Michael keaton is uh picked to be cast as a villain in a new spider-man movie and I was like what the and I just started yeah I had there's nothing I could do about it because I thought he was going to be carnage
[213:56.26]I'm just thinking, like, imagine, like, Michael Keaton Beetlejuice Carnage.
[214:00.71]Oh my god, I was so ready for that.
[214:09.50]Too bad.
[214:10.98]But he did a fantastic job as Vulture.
[214:29.59]This is my number one podcast.
[214:31.21]Hey, welcome to the cast.
[214:32.95]Hey, guys.
[214:34.83]Let me be the first to welcome you to my new series.
[214:39.41]The Calmcast.
[214:43.75]As you see, we're using our fishing rod here.
[214:48.73]Welcome to the Calmcast.
[214:52.55]We talk about movies, TV shows, while we fish.
[214:58.72]If you have anything, any topic you want to talk about, anything that you got on your mind, throw it out there.
[215:16.26]You, alright, no, no, no, no, listen to me, this is important.
[215:19.37]You cannot do a -2 and then an LUL after that.
[215:23.35]Doesn't that contradict...
[215:26.08]That -2.
[215:28.26]Don't correct me here.
[215:30.90]I'm sorry.
[215:31.78]I don't think that matches up.
[215:39.96]Do I have enough money?
[215:52.64]Worst streamer on Twitch?
[215:55.68]Worst streamer... Really?
[216:03.59]Worse than like the dickhead that streamed porn?
[216:09.13]Worse than that?
[216:23.84]Yeah.
[216:31.72]How could you compare yourself?
[216:37.19]That stream was... Ah, I'm not even gonna say it.
[216:40.17]I am not gonna take this because I get arrested every time.
[216:42.89]I'm doing it!
[217:01.02]Look at this.
[217:01.48]Yeah.
[217:08.96]How do I just end the day?
[217:09.86]I have an unlimited license here.
[217:11.36]End the day.
[217:13.15]I need money.
[217:13.75]End the day.
[217:16.39]End the day.
[217:18.95]How do I end the day?
[217:26.76]300 bucks is exactly where I was started with.
[217:30.13]20, 30 minutes ago.
[217:30.87]That's exactly where I was 30 minutes ago.
[217:35.51]God damn it.
[217:38.13]I need to catch five fish.
[217:40.07]I'm not going to keep any illegal fish.
[217:45.38]Promise.
[217:51.64]Sell old rods for cash.
[217:54.18]Sell old rods.
[217:55.10]Sell old rods.
[217:58.49]What do we got?
[217:59.57]Sell old rods.
[218:01.25]I gotta go home for this.
[218:01.95]Okay.
[218:12.07]Inventory.
[218:13.67]Home.
[218:15.24]Ooh, shit.
[218:16.18]Okay.
[218:16.76]Minispin 800.
[218:17.98]Sell off enough.
[218:18.44]Yes, I do.
[218:19.54]Value spin 63.
[218:22.78]Done.
[218:23.08]Alright, let's go.
[218:25.64]Rocky Lake.
[218:26.46]First time ever.
[218:29.25]We're getting there.
[218:30.91]Rocky Lake, Colorado.
[218:32.03]Travel for one day.
[218:34.95]Got my license.
[218:35.61]Let's go.
[218:42.72]No, I'm not going to spend anything.
[218:44.04]Okay, we got what we got here.
[218:46.26]Marshmallows.
[218:48.10]I have whisked crickets.
[218:49.00]Alright, I'm going to get some bluegills.
[218:51.53]Colorado golden trout is crickets as possible.
[218:56.07]Anything else?
[218:56.75]I need crickets as a much higher up on that list.
[219:01.76]Dough balls, crickets, crickets.
[219:04.02]I think we're going to go over here.
[219:06.08]Golden Shiner.
[219:07.80]This looks like a good place to start.
[219:09.82]What do you guys think?
[219:30.37]Don't write.
[219:30.77]Nobody write that.
[219:37.46]Okay, now... I've got my... Let's try it.
[219:40.80]Right here.
[219:41.30]Right off the rock.
[219:41.88]Look at this beautiful mountain, rocky Colorado.
[219:52.26]Barbarous nano spinner.
[219:54.38]Stop and go.
[219:54.98]Stop and go.
[220:00.81]What are your thoughts on a potential Disney-themed Super Smash Bros.
[220:04.13]game?
[220:04.79]With the amount of shit owned by Disney, you could have Tom Brady versus Darth Vader versus Donald Duck.
[220:12.16]I mean, I've said from the very beginning that I think Scrooge McDuck would be a perfect addition to Smash Bros.
[220:17.50]That moveset is already there.
[220:19.44]I can already see it.
[220:21.67]The issue is, didn't Sakurai already say, that they have to have originated on a video game console, right?
[220:29.15]But what a perfect addition that would be.
[220:32.34]And there it is, Bluegill.
[220:34.50]It's alright, I'll keep it.
[220:39.79]Nintendo and Disney hate each other.
[220:41.95]Where do you get that from?
[220:50.66]Tom Brady's special move is invoking Gronk, who spikes the enemy into the turf.
[221:00.46]I think at that point I would probably quit video games.
[221:04.66]That would probably be time.
[221:05.52]I would probably look at that and be like, I think I'm done with this.
[221:09.50]I don't think this is for me anymore.
[221:17.86]The lines are getting tangled.
[221:28.10]This is kind of a big one.
[221:32.09]I'm going to choke this guy and rip his head over.
[221:47.05]What is it?
[221:51.13]Whoa, alright.
[221:54.39]That's pretty good.
[222:01.60]Why do I think this guy cares?
[222:04.76]I'm just automatically assuming that everybody here is in chat.
[222:08.39]Look what I have.
[222:11.69]That's pretty good, though.
[222:13.46]Oh, I do care.
[222:14.06]Hey, see?
[222:15.98]127 bucks.
[222:16.74]Pretty good.
[222:17.06]Let's get another one.
[222:33.43]That was a big cast, I know.
[222:43.25]Jesus Christ.
[222:44.61]Fishing.
[222:47.57]I'm not sure if that's somebody coming in and saying, oh, I can't believe you're doing this, or like, this is cold to me.
[222:58.41]I'll take it.
[222:58.87]20 bucks.
[223:02.59]Ooh.
[223:04.73]Ooh.
[223:06.15]Narrow spoon.
[223:08.49]Small minnows.
[223:09.55]Small cut bait.
[223:16.73]What's the biggest thing in this game?
[223:17.98]How do I get... I want to go on a boat.
[223:21.22]Can I take out a loan?
[223:28.48]Jesus Christ.
[223:30.46]Fishing.
[223:33.24]What?
[223:33.62]Hold on.
[223:33.90]Do you have a... You're doing two at the same time?
[223:36.96]What happens if you catch one on there?
[223:38.88]You have to drop the one you're holding?
[223:45.99]Do people actually... Do people multi-box fishing?
[223:48.31]I didn't know people did this.
[223:53.11]How many of these can you reliably do?
[224:00.44]That's kind of big.
[224:01.12]Let's see.
[224:05.62]That's alright.
[224:06.94]No, it's 0.28 pounds.
[224:07.62]That's alright.
[224:11.24]That's pretty good.
[224:12.10]Not bad.
[224:21.01]See, now I get to be the guy that has the cool rod.
[224:23.03]There we go.
[224:28.99]Another one.
[224:29.25]This is a good spot.
[224:35.80]Don't lose it.
[224:43.14]Another big one.
[224:46.16]I want... Dude, nothing can replace that, like, four pound fish that I caught.
[224:49.78]I think it was awesome.
[224:59.66]I took your name and wow.
[225:01.64]Catch one fish for me to get it back.
[225:04.83]See, that's where you've already played yourself, unfortunately, because when was the last time you've ever seen me in a game, especially a multiplayer game, where Jerma985 was my name?
[225:16.34]It's gonna be like fucking Harold26.
[225:34.82]Do a quick take that one.
[225:44.64]Don't take that one.
[225:45.58]Don't take Harold26.
[225:46.42]That's my name.
[225:48.98]It's gonna be my WoW name.
[225:50.25]He's gonna be... Doesn't matter.
[225:54.11]I'll find it.
[225:54.89]I'll find another one.
[226:00.73]Right at the end.
[226:01.19]Got one.
[226:03.31]Zag.
[226:19.59]I just turned on the developer console.
[226:24.21]Make your WoW character before they take all the names.
[226:27.27]I don't care about the name of the character.
[226:35.11]It's okay.
[226:39.03]Did I lose him?
[226:39.85]I think I lost it.
[226:47.39]Oh, I was going to look.
[226:48.67]I want to see it.
[226:55.19]I'm doing this stupidly.
[226:57.39]Nah, just get it back in here.
[227:00.69]Okay.
[227:03.70]These are all $30 to $50 each.
[227:04.84]I feel like that's all I'm getting over here, though.
[227:10.66]Um... I want to put on... I just got a bunch of crickets.
[227:14.74]Different line...
[227:16.96]Can I not put a... Shit, I have to use this.
[227:26.37]I mean, I'm catching stuff all over the place, but I want to put on that new bait.
[227:34.51]I took the hook off.
[227:36.20]This is the spinner rod, right?
[227:40.50]Am I going to play Final Fantasy, the entirety of Final Fantasy?
[227:43.26]I'm not going to do that.
[227:45.30]I don't think so.
[227:45.90]Sorry.
[227:55.52]Stop that.
[228:00.03]Did that in one stream.
[228:10.01]Is there ever been an RPG I've considered?
[228:11.51]I guess I've technically played some RPGs on this stream.
[228:20.95]Not... I don't know.
[228:22.09]Have I ever done a turn-based RPG on this stream?
[228:24.49]I think I have.
[228:25.09]No.
[228:26.04]Don't think so.
[228:26.42]I think all the fish are gone here.
[228:32.24]I'm moving.
[228:32.58]Alright, I'm moving.
[228:42.85]I don't like this spot anymore.
[228:49.33]I'm gonna go down here.
[228:55.76]Alright, so I've been playing Fishing Planet for four hours.
[229:02.07]This is just a... I am liking this, though.
[229:04.65]But... Okay.
[229:08.97]Trying to think about something here.
[229:10.17]Hold on.
[229:15.73]Fishing Planet 2 incoming.
[229:18.77]I actually like this.
[229:20.87]I catch a big one?
[229:21.55]I did.
[229:21.91]I got a huge one earlier.
[229:24.65]If you were here, you would have been like, what the fuck?
[229:35.66]Alright, got it.
[229:46.44]I feel like this is a rubber band.
[229:50.14]What's going on here?
[230:07.27]Come on.
[230:16.26]I would just swim over there and take it out.
[230:21.94]That's not that far away.
[230:23.32]That's right there.
[230:24.08]I warned you about the lily pads.
[230:29.89]What a dummy.
[230:48.81]I lost that.
[230:50.41]I lost that.
[230:51.33]That thing was expensive, wasn't it?
[230:54.75]Oh, fuck me.
[230:56.71]That thing was like six or seven hundred dollars.
[230:59.43]Alright, I need to go back to my house.
[231:03.29]Is it gonna be a whole day?
[231:05.35]How long does it take to go back to your house?
[231:12.91]You can fly from Colorado to Texas back to Colorado in a day.
[231:20.29]Okay, I'm good.
[231:23.28]I just got this wave of craving in my brain.
[231:26.22]It just happened a second ago, right now.
[231:29.56]Stuffed crust Pizza Hut pizza.
[231:32.20]It just... It just deposited into my head.
[231:34.71]Alright, um...
[231:43.24]Where is it?
[231:43.60]I got it back to my home here.
[231:46.29]Take this off.
[231:47.55]Telefloat.
[231:48.73]Item can't be replaced with only item of the same type.
[231:53.11]Telefloat.
[231:54.47]And then I'm going to put on the hook.
[231:58.21]Reel must be equipped.
[231:59.38]Okay.
[232:00.68]Relax.
[232:01.56]Where's my reel?
[232:06.50]Spin.
[232:08.22]This looks kind of cool.
[232:15.77]Too heavy.
[232:16.27]We'll break the line.
[232:17.55]Fine.
[232:22.17]Now I want crickets.
[232:25.55]Hook must be equipped first.
[232:28.21]Alright.
[232:29.89]Tackle's too heavy and we'll break the line.
[232:31.71]What will break the line?
[232:33.65]This is going to break the line?
[232:37.23]Two pounds.
[232:37.67]Here.
[232:38.13]Put this one on.
[232:39.47]There.
[232:39.69]You alright?
[232:41.23]Crickets.
[232:42.81]Crickets.
[232:45.56]Here we go.
[232:52.41]It's not sponsored.
[232:55.53]Sponsored.
[232:56.53]This game came out like three years ago.
[233:16.17]Alright, I'm back, guys.
[233:22.07]This time, I got crickets.
[233:28.82]Looking for a different fish.
[233:38.47]I have, yeah, I've gone fishing before.
[233:39.83]Plenty of times.
[233:49.05]It's an interesting thing for a minute.
[233:51.39]I get bored really easily, though.
[233:55.69]Here we go.
[233:56.87]First catch with the crickets.
[234:00.85]Ooh, this is new.
[234:01.95]What is this one?
[234:04.97]Ooh.
[234:06.57]Black crappie.
[234:10.02]You're out of current bait.
[234:17.76]I only bought one cricket.
[234:32.76]You bought a one cricket!
[234:51.54]They're right here.
[234:52.31]What?
[234:52.55]98.
[234:55.27]How do I put them into my backpack?
[235:03.20]Why will they not go to my backpack?
[235:04.66]I'm putting one... I'm putting... I'm baiting one cricket onto my pole.
[235:11.52]And then putting that in a backpack.
[235:14.40]And then getting on a plane.
[235:17.09]Getting out of the plane.
[235:18.33]Taking the tackle out of my checked bag and everything.
[235:20.93]Doing that and then leaving.
[235:22.49]Why would I do this?
[235:23.41]How can I not put this over here?
[235:25.07]How do I bring more than one?
[235:26.35]Hey, Cricket.
[235:39.24]Put it over there.
[235:42.09]oh my god you said to do that really oh that stinks well whatever let's I still have a day pass it's two thousand dollars to do that did I seriously spend two thousand did I spend two thousand to go there and come back
[236:27.55]Anybody here like crickets?
[236:33.80]Come on.
[236:35.22]Crickets.
[236:38.94]What is a crankbait?
[236:41.66]Bloodworm.
[236:42.42]Of course not.
[236:44.68]Nobody.
[236:45.31]Crickets.
[236:45.77]Nobody.
[236:50.55]What about the other side?
[237:03.22]Well, that was Fishing Planet.
[237:06.92]Fun little game, free.
[237:12.80]As you can tell, it's interesting roguelike.
[237:15.58]You can run into money and you have to, you know, go back and try it again and start kind of from the beginning.
[237:19.98]They'll eat crickets.
[237:24.20]They will.
[237:25.82]A cricket and a grasshopper are the same bug.
[237:34.38]Cricket and a grasshopper, God just randomized the role between the two of them.
[237:38.90]You know, it was just like that you made a grasshopper and then you did the random button like 10 times.
[237:45.26]They're the same fucking thing.
[237:48.01]One chirps like a bird.
[237:49.41]Big deal.
[238:00.68]That's like saying blue cheese sauce is the same as blue cheese dressing.
[238:03.98]I fucked up.
[238:05.48]Okay?
[238:06.84]I'm sorry, I fucked up.
[238:08.06]Fortnite Jimmy is joining us again.
[238:09.80]I'm actually happy about that.
[238:17.49]Jimmy's back.
[238:20.41]I am really excited about this.
[238:21.93]I can't wait to see what Fortnite Jimmy asks.
[238:47.74]Um...
[239:22.13]Can I tell you guys something?
[239:24.19]I love this stream.
[239:25.45]This is one of my favorite streams of the last two months.
[239:31.55]I am very happy right now.
[239:33.73]Can I just tell you?
[239:40.97]I think for me, favorite best streams of all time is Sims 4 Mod Murder House.
[239:47.20]Fishing Planet.
[239:48.48]Close second.
[240:07.46]Nobody wants crickets.
[240:08.32]It's okay.
[240:13.03]Fishing is just outdoor gambling.
[240:17.01]It's really strange that I know exactly what you're talking about.
[240:20.27]That's funny.
[240:21.73]That's weird.
[240:22.11]Yeah, it is.
[241:56.86]That's better.
[242:02.82]They don't eat cheese either.
[242:45.44]You only get one?
[242:46.83]What's that even mean?
[242:47.61]Yeah, I'm busy, but I only get one, though.
[242:50.96]But I'm here.
[242:51.40]I'm available for questions.
[243:17.07]This is turning into a dad stream?
[243:23.44]I was gonna take the cheese off.
[243:24.50]This isn't working.
[243:42.93]Guys, this is not like a 10-year-old, alright?
[243:46.91]I'm being trolled right now.
[243:49.59]Why am I, like, I'm, like, getting in my own head.
[243:51.67]Like, wait a minute.
[243:52.85]I better, like, tell this person, like, hey, it's, like, fun.

[245:18.54]Ugh.
[245:52.18]This is a troll I'm being I didn't just leave them being fucked with right now you guys have been you guys have fallen for it
[246:29.17]I can't go back there.
[246:37.06]I didn't answer any questions.
[246:43.94]I can't go back.
[246:45.47]I can't go back in there.
[246:47.71]Okay, I'm going back.
[246:54.85]I'm in!
[246:55.67]Okay, I'm back.

[247:32.29]Okay.
[247:51.44]The internet cafe.
[247:55.78]I'm being trolled.
[248:19.45]He got lost in the realm.
[248:37.46]He went to go pick up some herbs.
[248:41.46]Why did I leave him?
[248:43.54]How could I have done that?
[248:47.22]I'll be right back.
[248:47.83]I'm going to go get water.
[251:46.14]I keep laughing.
[251:47.08]I can't stop.
[251:49.32]I keep laughing at just like the mom's MacBook like overheating.
[251:56.26]And I just keep seeing this image in my head.
[251:58.18]It was like the mom's MacBook overheated and like did an auto like Intel shut down the computer.
[252:03.74]You know, Intel has that shit.
[252:05.90]And I just see him standing there still for two minutes before he just because he's gone, but he doesn't get disconnected yet.
[252:16.10]And he's just standing there.
[252:17.51]Lost somewhere.
[252:18.29]And he just gets fucking disconnected and it takes two minutes for his portrait to disappear.
[252:23.76]Ugh.
[253:09.60]I can't even play this anymore.
[253:12.13]I can't play this game right now.
[253:14.71]It's all ruined.
[253:16.85]It's ruined for me.
[253:19.10]I can't play it.
[253:44.02]Fortnite Jimmy 2010.
[254:07.50]Alright, I'm sorry, but if somebody comes into a fish game and asks me how to get Fortnite skins, I'm going to automatically assume that that person is a viewer just trying to get, like, onto my skin.
[254:19.16]Jimmy, I'm sorry!
[254:20.36]I'm sorry, Jimmy, if you're watching.
[254:38.78]You're the only streamer that's played this long enough to become a villain.
[254:44.73]You don't become a villain in a fishing game.
[254:46.89]I just, I didn't do anything.
[254:49.07]I, all I said, I said, hey, I'm ready to answer questions.
[254:53.97]I'm busy.
[254:55.15]But like, you know, I'll give one question for any person in the server.
[255:00.01]I'm not the bad guy.
[255:00.89]I was answering questions.
[255:07.91]Then you left.
[255:08.47]Yeah, I said, I was like, hey, good luck, man.
[255:10.27]I gotta go.
[255:10.99]Like, what?
[255:11.53]I'm not allowed to leave a game?
[255:14.27]I can't leave?
[255:15.43]Phylacter Lich gave $50.
[255:30.36]Jerma bullied Jimmy.
[255:31.44]He was just a kid, Jerma.
[255:45.01]You left him in the realm where there are no fish to fish and no walls to wall run.
[256:03.13]I have to... God damn.
[256:08.33]This shit is fucking ridiculous.
[256:14.37]nice cast I'm with Jimmy right now what do you want me to say tell him I'll answer any question I got extra time I got extra time on my internet cafe card and I'm around
[256:50.90]We can't just go back to fishing after this.
[256:53.10]Can we?
[256:53.76]I think maybe.
[256:54.58]Maybe.
[256:54.96]If I like just go back to normal.
[256:57.24]I need to go back to normal.
[256:59.46]Get the cheese off.
[257:00.30]I'm going to put some pet food on here.
[257:03.32]I'm going to go back to normal.
[257:05.62]I didn't do anything wrong.
[257:07.43]I didn't do anything.
[257:10.05]I'm fishing.
[257:23.81]That's what a villain would do.
[257:38.04]He sent you a friend request.
[257:42.94]Did he?
[257:43.32]Hold on, wait a minute.
[257:45.89]Did Jimmy send me a friend request?
[257:55.34]No, it's just too many Fortnite characters.
[257:59.40]Too many Fortnite characters.
[258:01.64]Alright, I'll take them both.
[258:03.78]Are you happy?
[258:06.06]I'll take Kyle 2007.

[276:26.18]It's 160 coins to change your fucking name?
[276:28.11]What?
[276:59.53]This is why I don't enter in-game chats.
[277:01.39]I never do either.
[277:02.45]And I was pressured to answer questions from the chatroom.
[277:08.93]This one.
[277:09.65]This is an in-game chat right here.
[277:10.98]Fortnite Jeremy.
[277:29.31]You have to quit streaming.
[278:21.44]Did I just, wait, did I just PM them?
[278:26.35]Oh no!
[278:27.65]Get!
[278:46.42]Why would somebody write that?
[278:58.84]Don't install the game.
[279:09.31]I'm staying.
[279:34.25]Sorry, we're good.
[280:04.86]Terrible.

[284:24.19]Oh, God.
[284:29.20]My head is fucking killing me.
[284:54.49]This is worse than the Labo streams and the Birdhouse streams.
[284:57.99]Somehow I disagree.
[284:59.11]I'm not sure why.
[285:15.90]This is cozy.
[285:16.58]This has been a cozy stream.
[285:21.54]I'll be live tomorrow, too.
[285:27.25]Tomorrow, we're probably going to play maximum action.
[285:44.80]I missed it?
[285:45.20]What?
[285:49.08]Yeah, it is a constant conflict game.
[285:51.36]You're right.
[286:05.64]How long is maximum action?
[286:09.70]Is it more than two or three hours?
[286:11.94]Or is it a quick game?
[286:19.57]It's long, right?
[286:20.43]Long enough.
[286:26.47]I could probably do a whole stream on it, right?
[286:40.73]What's the best fish I've ever eaten?
[286:42.09]A piece of king salmon from an Italian restaurant in Boston.
[286:46.77]And I don't remember the name of the restaurant.
[286:49.33]Because I'm stupid.
[287:06.06]That is true.
[287:06.62]Yeah.
[287:07.08]I wish I remembered.
[287:09.57]It was one of those scenarios where I was with my family and it was like, oh, let's go out to this place.
[287:14.26]And it just kind of blended together with everything else.
[287:21.12]The thing is, though, a lot of those, a lot of Boston restaurants, especially the, they can have not only very similar menus, but there's a ton, especially in the North End, there are so many Italian restaurants that it's, there's probably hundreds of them.
[287:59.88]Who is that in the distance?
[288:04.08]I don't know.
[288:04.52]Somebody on the server?
[288:11.06]Look to your left.
[288:15.12]What?
[288:19.27]Yeah, this fishingman62.
[288:20.29]He's just playing the game.
[288:28.54]Aww.
[288:28.94]I'm keeping it.
[288:38.85]That crept up so fast, I couldn't stop it.
[288:44.75]Oh, yeah.
[288:45.53]I wish I knew this menu.
[288:46.88]Why did I not know that there was a Metal Gear Solid menu?
[288:57.02]Pet food.
[289:11.49]Who uses cheese to fish?
[289:12.57]A lot of people.
[289:13.63]It's used a lot.
[289:20.40]Talk to fishing.
[289:21.34]No.
[289:22.62]I'm no longer speaking in this chat.
[289:29.50]I'm just a guy playing video game.
[289:31.30]That's it.
[289:41.16]The game's feeling eerie.
[289:43.12]That's because it's covered in smoke.
[289:45.82]There's like a whole fog over everything.
[289:49.90]That's just like, that's just scary.
[289:51.46]It's scary.
[289:51.96]That is a scary trope.
[290:05.22]This is illegal.
[290:06.28]I'm gonna release it.
[290:07.58]I'm not getting in trouble.
[290:08.40]I don't have any money.
[290:14.45]Why do I have so much?
[290:15.67]I have 198 pieces of cheese.
[290:25.10]Why do I have all this?
[290:32.56]This is too many.
[290:34.14]Can I sell it?
[290:36.58]Can I get market value for this?
[290:43.80]Another illegal fish.
[290:45.02]Don't think so.
[291:09.22]He's here.
[291:11.43]You know how many versions of Fortnite Jimmy I've seen in this chat?
[291:15.05]There's like four of them.
[291:34.45]Five hours.
[291:45.90]What am I gonna eat for food after this?
[291:50.66]Please press T. Alright, let me try that.
[291:57.76]It's been 5 a.m.
[291:58.60]the whole stream.
[292:05.08]2 p.m.?
[292:07.96]Am I gonna do this?
[292:10.05]What about all the other people in here?
[292:21.48]I guess I just can control time.
[292:35.39]This actually looks really nice.
[292:36.49]It's client-side, idiot.
[292:49.85]No!
[292:51.17]What?
[292:51.67]Hey, what?
[292:53.13]No, no, no!
[292:54.91]No, no, no!
[293:00.94]Why am I being... Oh no!
[293:11.97]Why is it doing this?
[293:34.82]Say you're sorry you don't know the controls.
[293:37.37]No, that's assumed.
[293:38.41]That's assumed.
[293:39.63]I'm like the third person at this point.
[293:48.99]Can I get a manager?
[293:51.85]I don't understand.
[293:52.83]I'm trying to talk to people and I'm just PMing this random Fortnite person?
[293:56.39]Oh no.
[293:58.93]Oh, what the fuck have I done?
[294:02.23]What the fuck?
[294:36.23]Easy.
[294:36.81]Easy.
[294:37.11]Easy.
[294:37.41]Easy.
[294:37.73]Easy.
[294:37.97]Wrong message.
[294:38.39]Sorry.
[294:38.65]Easy.
[294:39.97]Easy.
[294:40.29]Easy.
[294:40.53]That's like very simple.
[294:41.23]Easy.
[294:41.45]How do I get out of this?
[294:53.30]No.
[294:53.72]No.
[294:54.12]No.
[294:54.50]No.
[294:55.72]No.
[294:57.76]No.
[294:57.98]I just was like wrong.
[294:58.84]I was wrong.
[294:59.46]That would make no sense.
[295:03.58]What did I just take?
[295:13.48]No, like, oh, sorry, like, that was the wrong message.
[295:15.58]I was sending it, like, oh, Sonny, is it Sonny?
[295:18.03]That's the wrong message, very clearly.
[295:24.87]I'm just nice to everybody.
[295:33.70]Why did I have to message Jimmy again?
[295:38.54]I was trying to prove somebody wrong in chat.
[295:41.52]And they were right.
[295:43.45]But, uh... Jerma sucks.
[295:45.61]Thanks for the five community subs.
[295:48.71]Thank you.
[296:01.28]No, it's not the same person.
[296:02.26]It's not the same person.
[296:02.82]Like, oh, that was the wrong message.
[296:03.60]I'm just another person at the Internet Cafe.
[296:05.51]I'm just another person.
[296:07.05]Don't you guys understand?
[296:08.33]Like, I don't know who that person is.
[297:15.73]Ask him for bits.
[297:19.43]Why did I have to fucking type?
[297:21.47]I said, didn't I specifically say?
[297:25.79]I'm not writing in an in-game chat ever again.
[297:27.96]And look what the fuck happened.
[297:30.24]Look at what happened.
[297:33.64]I messaged the Fortnite troll person.
[298:17.83]He's in chat right now.
[298:18.63]Well, then he'll know that I'm streaming from an internet cafe.
[298:22.39]It's really loud in here.
[298:25.05]It's fucking really, really loud in here.
[298:36.52]Hey, sorry.
[298:37.80]It's... I'm sharing a space with like two or three different... There's like three people that way and like five people that way.
[298:45.24]There's like another 20 people in the other offices down here.
[298:50.93]I'm looking back at all these computers are doing a good they're all playing well playing the same game
[299:25.63]Hey!
[299:26.79]Easy!
[299:27.83]Quit dropping glasses back there.
[299:29.43]We all have to share this space, fuckin' asshole.
[299:37.77]See you later.
[299:39.43]Yeah, you should have said that.
[299:43.11]I got a fucking four pounder.
[299:44.66]Take it easy, man.
[299:45.66]See you tomorrow.
[300:09.73]Keep it down.
[300:28.17]Hey!
[300:32.33]Hey, easy.
[300:32.89]It's just a game, man.
[300:34.53]You don't get to smash the computer.
[300:39.07]We all lose them sometimes.
[300:40.78]You can't catch the big one every time.
[300:50.17]Thank you.
[301:17.57]Thanks for watching, Jimmy, though.
[301:19.20]I got, you can see, my time's almost up.
[301:27.05]What, my time's up now?
[301:28.25]Alright.
[301:50.47]Oh wait, sorry, I forgot.
[301:52.09]There's still people here.
[301:53.41]There's still people here.
[301:56.83]Sorry!
[301:59.47]I'm sorry.
[302:38.69]Excuse me!
[302:42.59]Excuse me, could I get another 25 minute card, please?
[302:47.19]Yeah, over here.
[302:49.81]Me, number 42.
[302:54.99]That's not, that's, I don't know why you played a flute at me.
[302:58.64]I guess that's a sound that plays when you call the person over to come over and ring you up.
[303:16.49]Okay, so, uh... I'm over here.
[303:27.14]I'm over here!
[303:27.90]Please, come over to me!
[303:35.20]Thank you!
[303:36.87]I'm over here!
[303:37.71]My god, I need... How many... Yeah, thank you.
[303:40.21]Could this... Yes.
[303:42.85]Yeah, I've got the Visa.
[303:44.01]I'll take one 20-minute.
[303:48.23]Yeah, I want a 20-minute.
[303:51.89]Thanks.
[303:52.27]Actually, I want... Give me two of those.
[303:55.33]Yeah.
[303:55.81]Just keep going.
[303:59.26]Yeah, maybe grab a 45-minute, too.
[304:01.18]Yeah.
[304:02.56]Another one.
[304:02.98]Thank you.
[304:07.42]Thank you.
[304:07.82]I'll take that.
[304:09.90]That's my card.
[304:17.55]I'm gonna puke.
[304:23.55]Let me scratch off the back.
[304:27.42]Oh, good, this is a 20 minute one.
[304:29.00]Yeah, this is what I asked for.
[304:30.04]I'm gonna punch the code in real quick.
[304:37.13]Thank you.
[304:59.62]Fortnite Jimmy's dad gave $50.
[305:01.80]Are you the guy that harassed my son?
[305:06.31]Stop playing in that cafe.
[305:07.95]Oh, God.
[305:08.79]Get out of here.
[305:12.73]Well, I hate to tell you, Fortnite Jimmy's dad, you didn't have to give me $50 to say that.
[305:19.18]You could have read the info down there.
[305:21.52]It was $2.50 for me to read that.
[305:52.81]Okay, I need to relax.
[305:54.17]I'm going to fucking die.
[305:55.25]I'm going to pee my pants.
[306:14.90]Alright.
[306:17.00]How many fish do I have?
[306:33.62]Did you lose 600 viewers for that joke?
[306:37.93]I don't know.
[306:38.53]Probably.
[306:45.46]Something like that.
[306:51.34]They thought the stream was over.
[306:52.62]That's true.
[306:59.76]You know, it probably is.
[307:01.37]I'm going to be real.
[307:03.11]It probably is.
[307:13.21]Fortnite Jimmy's dad, another $50.
[307:15.55]$100 Fortnite Jimmy's dad.
[307:16.45]I know you heard my car, streamer.
[307:19.67]Consequences will never be the same.
[307:21.48]That's a meme thing.
[307:37.03]Thank you for the hundred bucks, though.
[307:38.79]For real.
[307:48.09]I've been making a lot of fucking old man noises.
[307:53.01]Caught any big ones?
[307:53.71]I did.
[307:53.99]I need to get some other bait.
[308:09.95]Man, you guys are fucking hilarious.
[308:14.21]Sometimes a stream will happen where some of the shit that you guys are doing and saying, it just does it to me and it fucking throws me off.
[308:24.67]You guys are hilarious.
[308:25.97]Like, seriously.
[308:27.57]I just, yeah, I aged like 30 years in the last 10 minutes.
[308:39.86]I think this is going to be the end of the fishing trip though.
[308:46.09]I actually laughed myself into a migraine.
[308:48.51]I have a headache now.
[308:49.35]Like a bad one.
[308:50.19]There's too much stimulation in my brain.
[308:56.60]But yeah.
[309:09.56]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[309:13.72]Thanks for joining me.
[309:14.40]This stream really... Yeah, that's... How do you go from here, right?
[309:18.79]It's been over five hours.
[309:19.87]I'm going to do the bits.
[309:20.51]It'll probably be about five or six hours.
[309:21.91]That's good.
[309:23.63]I'll be live tomorrow.
[309:25.95]Oh my goodness.
[309:29.25]I will see you guys tomorrow for maximum action.
[309:39.13]Fishing Planet.
[309:39.93]It's a fun game.
[309:42.79]It's a solid 6.7.
[309:43.55]It's fun.
[309:47.09]It's just... Come on.
[309:48.15]You can sit here and relax and pretend to be at an internet cafe.
[309:59.60]Hey.
[310:02.50]Ugh.
[310:08.58]Special thanks to Fortnite, Jimmy.
[310:09.96]Hope you have a wonderful rest of your in-game time.
[310:16.55]My time is up right here.
[310:18.59]I will actually, for real, see you tomorrow.
[310:22.57]Stick around for the bits if you want to.
[310:28.43]Maximum action tomorrow, same time.
[310:30.30]Probably around, like, 3-ish p.m.
[310:32.14]3 or 4.
[310:42.59]As always, see you soon.
[310:46.20]Thank you for watching.
[310:49.42]We are going to go back to a little bit earlier.
[310:52.36]We had 2.50 from Gnarly.
[310:57.69]So when are you going to come visit?
[310:58.59]I'm available this Friday if you want to come over for lunch.
[311:05.43]For lunch?
[311:13.51]I'm not sure.
[311:13.97]Yeah, then there's another one from Gnarly.
[311:15.71]Also, by the way, very excited for the carnival stream.
[311:17.65]Thanks for working so hard putting it together.
[311:18.99]I hope I can watch it live.
[311:20.15]I hope you can too.
[311:21.35]I hope as many people can... That's why I said September 21st.
[311:26.06]Trying to get as much time for people to realize if they can go or if they want to participate or if they're going to be around for it.
[311:33.18]I believe that's Saturday or Sunday, 21st.
[311:43.41]Should be a lot of fun.
[311:45.07]A lot of time, a lot of work is going into it, so I'm as excited as you, for real.
[311:51.28]Thank you, Gnarly, for the $5.
[311:52.08]Appreciate it.
[311:54.14]Shalashka, thanks for the $2.50.
[311:56.26]You're an actor.
[311:56.86]Do you have any tips on memorizing something in your own way?
[312:01.87]The easiest way to memorize lines is to have somebody else do them with you.
[312:07.94]Because instead of just staring at a paper, you take the paper away, and they have the paper, and can correct you.
[312:16.74]It's much more fluid, it's much easier to memorize something when you're not the one staring at the paper.
[312:33.24]Then they steal your part.
[312:34.52]That's not how it works.
[312:39.39]What is the Carnival stream?
[312:40.41]The Carnival stream is going to be a Twitch-controlled stream.
[312:47.83]There are going to be a series of large robots who Chad is going to control to play Carnival Midway games throughout the day.
[312:59.52]That is on the 21st of September.
[313:01.80]Why don't you count?
[313:04.28]Should be a lot of fun.
[313:16.08]Can we physically be at the carnival?
[313:18.23]No.
[313:20.37]No.
[313:21.59]There's going to be... I thought about like, oh, maybe have people there.
[313:25.81]When you have something like that with... I'm not saying that anything here is going to be dangerous.
[313:32.25]But legally and liability speaking, I don't want anybody that's not part of this production to be on this set with machines that are able to
[313:44.69]With big machines, you know I'm saying I don't want anyone to have any that's just not something I want to do Is it gonna be free?
[313:51.06]Absolutely It has nothing to do with how dangerous the machines are but the functions of the machines are
[314:06.16]You know, if somebody somehow touches one of them or... Because they're going to be engineers here.
[314:11.06]That they're responsible for them.
[314:13.18]I would never want a scenario where somebody... I don't know.
[314:16.63]Think about any scenario where somebody would touch it or fall onto it or trip or grab it or try to take a picture with it or something.
[314:23.33]You know, you've got to be careful.
[314:25.09]And I don't want any of those scenarios to ever be a possibility.
[314:32.76]How are you controlling the machines in chat?
[314:36.27]Good luck.
[314:50.74]How much effort does it take to get word out that said Twitch-controlled stream is gonna take place?
[314:55.10]Well, I've been talking to... Twitch.
[315:01.17]And they seemed to be somewhat preliminarily interested in... Maybe... They're not working on it or anything.
[315:15.07]But I went back and forth a couple times with some of the people there to see if anything wanted to happen from it, or if they wanted to do something with it.
[315:23.98]But nobody at Twitch is working on this project at all.
[315:31.26]Yeah, something like maybe grab a front page slot or something, possibly.
[315:34.80]Maybe I'm going to see if it's available.
[315:36.93]That's another thing.
[315:40.04]I don't know, we'll see.
[315:41.22]I can't say that anything like that will or will not happen.
[315:44.41]But it might be interesting if it is.
[315:56.93]Mr. Twitch.
[315:59.56]How many viewers is it going to get?
[316:01.00]I have no idea.
[316:03.00]That's something that I cannot give you a prediction on.
[316:09.87]I would say, yeah, I would say at least four.
[316:11.73]Hey, Deep Fried Gundam, thanks for the $2.50.
[316:24.58]They say, been stressed out about my future due to recently graduating college, but your streams always help me relax and to not lose my shit.
[316:32.61]Love you, Jerembo, despite your garbage cheese takes.
[316:36.41]Garbage cheese takes.
[316:37.69]Swiss cheese, I think, is the best.
[316:38.84]That's what they're referring to.
[316:41.92]But no, graduating college is a huge change, because it's one of the first times in your life where you're not...
[316:50.98]sort of in schooling for the most part.
[316:54.36]Most people that go to college, you know, you typically do K through 12 and then maybe you take a year maybe or maybe you go right into college and it's a huge change.
[317:06.32]So it is like a big turning point in a lot of people's lives, right?
[317:19.30]I mean, when I graduated college, it was... It was kind of scary, it was.
[317:24.40]Because you've never known that before.
[317:29.85]So... Okay, it's time to do something.
[317:34.49]And what that is, I don't know.
[317:37.61]You look around for jobs, you try to find something that you're good at, or that you think is interesting, that you really care about, at least a handful of things.
[317:53.80]But hopefully over time and over, you know, months, years, whatever it takes, try to get something going, try to do something.
[318:04.45]People usually fall into something somehow.
[318:16.14]What did I do after college?
[318:18.02]After college, I kind of went right into, I'm gonna do video stuff.
[318:25.92]And that's where the wedding video stuff came from.
[318:28.64]I just was a freelance video maker.
[318:32.81]And, oh, you, you're a friend.
[318:34.81]I know a friend that's getting married.
[318:36.97]Hey, I'll do your wedding.
[318:39.13]I can do that.
[318:39.79]And then that person told a friend who was getting married.
[318:42.87]And that person told a friend.
[318:44.07]And I kind of worked off of just complete word of mouth.
[318:47.69]And that was it.
[318:53.71]I did not have a professional setup.
[318:57.68]I had a really nice camera, and obviously I thought the skill was necessary to be able to cut stuff like that up together, and people thought they were good.
[319:03.92]I got a lot of good comments of, hey, that was really well put together, thank you, we loved it, you know, whatever, and you just work off of that.
[319:11.70]That's kind of what I did for at least a couple of years.
[319:19.44]And I also substitute taught.
[319:23.36]I was a good substitute teacher.
[319:24.65]I did teacher's aid stuff.
[319:33.57]Teacher noise, yep.
[319:42.82]I was kind of all over the place until I really started to put... Because when I started that YouTube channel, it was just... I just did it because I thought it was fun.
[319:51.56]That was it.
[319:53.76]I didn't really have very many expectations on it.
[320:04.61]And that's kind of how I've kind of fallen into this.
[320:07.55]It's just kind of just keep going.
[320:09.53]It's worked out.
[320:12.48]If I did not... If I was not a streamer or a YouTuber or anything... If I wasn't doing this and putting all the time into it... I probably would have... Continued to do... I probably would have gone into education.
[320:26.75]I probably would have.
[320:28.29]And I know, like... I know... Hold on.
[320:30.89]You would be a teacher?
[320:31.91]I don't know.
[320:33.57]I think... I really like computers.
[320:35.97]I really like games.
[320:36.87]I really like... Talking to people.
[320:39.75]It would be... I would find something to do.
[320:52.79]even being in just in a like a school system or something right I probably would have fallen into that somehow or customer service because I remember we talked about the fishing trip I just I I just talk
[321:25.17]But thank you, Tingy, for the $250.
[321:26.25]Since you're talking about streaming stats, I want to bring to your attention that you are no longer a top 1,000 streamer.
[321:34.29]What do you mean?
[321:36.35]You are a top 500 streamer.
[321:40.16]What are you talking about?
[321:44.10]Top 500?
[321:44.30]What are you getting this for?
[321:51.99]Twitchmetrics.net
[321:55.06]going on here that for real these real stats 400 number 400 hold on a minute number 447 most watched that's top 500 number 42 most watched English variety channel
[322:26.28]That can't be correct.
[322:28.62]That's top 50.
[322:31.27]What?
[322:38.51]This is not like an edit source, right?
[322:40.77]This is a real website, right?
[322:43.41]You're not just giving me an edit source thing.
[322:46.23]No, but that's on my end.
[322:49.39]Alright.
[322:53.61]Let's go.
[323:04.86]Top 500.
[323:05.50]Damn, alright.
[323:08.74]I can't wait to tell my mom!
[323:14.87]Nah, I don't get there without the people that watch this channel.
[323:22.61]This is you guys, not me.
[323:29.46]Let's see if we can break top 100.
[323:35.47]We'll see.
[323:38.05]I don't know about that.
[323:40.53]But anyways, yeah, no, thanks.
[323:42.35]Thanks for watching.
[323:43.02]Thanks for being here.
[323:43.84]Thanks for getting this channel even in, like, even the top thousand.
[323:48.88]Top five thousand.
[323:49.68]Top two thousand.
[323:50.30]That's still a fucking huge deal.
[323:51.98]That's a big deal to me and a big deal to this community.
[323:53.96]So, for real.
[323:57.63]Peak viewers, I believe that's just for the month.
[323:59.27]Yeah.
[324:07.38]Stream 24 hours a day, you'd be number one.
[324:10.10]I don't think I could do that.
[324:11.94]That would be impossible.
[324:16.00]But yeah, thanks.
[324:19.38]We'll check back in on it in another six months, see where it is.
[324:24.22]Louis Cheese, $10 from Louis Cheese.
[324:28.46]Thanks for waking me up and for the new alarm sound.
[324:30.76]You're welcome.
[324:32.36]Whatever you woke up for, hopefully you got it done.
[324:34.99]Whatever it was.
[324:37.08]Thank you for the 10 bucks, and good morning.
[324:43.66]Hey lobotomized teddy bear, thanks for the 250.
[324:45.80]Here is a stream idea relating to fish.
[324:48.12]Eat fugu puffer fish, but you have to cut it and eat it on stream.
[324:53.12]You have to cut it and eat it on stream.
[324:54.59]It's a great idea.
[324:55.27]Nothing could go wrong.
[325:01.23]No, I don't care if it's... Honestly, I would never eat that, even if it was prepared by the most talented chef in the world.
[325:14.93]I would not do it.
[325:15.45]A little mini F. That's 58 drop frames in five and a half hours.
[325:27.30]It's pretty good.
[325:28.38]I think we're back to normal.
[325:35.14]Yeah, great stream idea.
[325:37.04]What's the next one?
[325:37.58]Hey, I got a great stream idea.
[325:39.06]Roll around in cactuses.
[325:43.07]It'd be fun.
[325:49.80]I think I will abstain.
[325:53.33]But thank you for the 250.
[325:54.13]Thank you Gnarly for the 250 again.
[325:55.77]I don't know.
[325:56.15]They call those cadences.
[325:58.03]I guess that's one of mine.
[326:18.42]mannerisms cadences let me tell you something hey let me tell you something yeah you're right hey let me tell you something I think what that is it's a way to tell the audience here comes a joke in my somewhere without me even being aware of it
[326:49.15]Maybe?
[326:51.69]Or it's a, this is somebody else talking.
[327:00.47]-2 incoming.
[327:04.52]Probably something like that.

[328:11.75]Hi, Jerma.
[328:12.73]I was wondering if you chose the carnival to be on the 21st because you sang the song September poorly once, or is that a coincidence?
[328:20.09]That is a 100% coincidence.
[328:25.79]Just happens to be on the same date of my favorite song ever.
[328:33.51]I mean, it was just a coincidence.
[328:38.23]Thanks for the $2.50.
[328:41.04]Stinky Beavers, thanks for the $2.50.
[328:42.10]Hey everybody, Jerma here, and welcome to a coffee commentary of Justice in Doom.
[328:52.10]I remember those.
[328:54.39]I remember thinking that the ironic, like, like, doom thing.
[329:00.48]I was doing, like, the ironic, like, of doom thing.
[329:03.44]I don't think anyone knew that.
[329:06.82]I think they just thought I was actually saying that.
[329:09.75]But I was.
[329:15.08]You guys know what I mean.
[329:15.82]Like, oh, it's me, I'm Doom.
[329:17.65]Haha, it was like a meme for a while.
[329:20.63]Yeah, yes, the penguin of Doom, right?
[329:22.63]That was a meme for like a while, like 10 years ago.
[329:29.21]Yeah, that's an old one.
[329:37.66]Surprised more of you guys know what that is.
[329:48.77]but, uh, thank you for the 250.
[329:49.73]Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the 250, Smelly Boy.

[330:13.37]Techno Rift, thanks for the $14.
[330:17.03]Thank you, Techno Rift.
[330:19.15]This has honestly been one of the most entertaining streams you've had in a while.
[330:22.29]From the fishing escapades to the father-son fishing bonding experience.
[330:27.23]Oh, I also got all these bits from watching like 500 ads for the last few months.
[330:31.16]Keep up the good work.
[330:34.12]Thank you for giving those to me.
[330:37.52]That seems like a lot of time spent watching ads.
[330:40.46]Thanks for the $14.
[330:46.37]Really appreciate that.
[330:48.60]And it was a fun one, I had a great time.
[330:51.74]This was a very, very fun stream for me.
[330:53.90]Wait, what?
[331:20.77]They thought that they were in there going like, no, I don't want to play.
[331:30.63]Jesus.
[331:32.89]Like with persons being like beat up.
[331:36.16]Oh, I don't want to, I don't want to type it.
[331:38.18]I don't want to type to that person.
[331:39.62]It's like, is everything alright in here?
[331:44.02]Like, is there like a swarm of bees in your room?
[331:47.06]What's going on?
[332:07.50]There's a wasp in your room.
[332:08.74]There's always a wasp in my room.
[332:12.06]But thank you, C4G, for the 250.
[332:15.48]Everything's fine.
[332:16.32]Everything's good.
[332:18.48]Hey, Squibble, thanks for the five dollars.
[332:19.86]This is probably the most activity Fishing Planet has ever seen.
[332:22.58]Thanks for the stream, dude.
[332:25.78]Maybe somebody played it and will be like, yeah, this is actually a pretty fun little game.
[332:31.62]Whatever.
[332:32.60]Play it.
[332:32.90]It's just a game, right?
[332:35.66]To play.
[332:38.22]It's a message from the dev.
[332:44.47]But thank you, Squibble.
[332:46.39]I'm gonna get the credits on the screen.
[332:48.19]We're getting to the end of the bits.
[332:50.33]Here they come.
[332:51.71]Special thanks to all of the new subs, the resubs, the community subs, all the people.
[332:56.63]See y'all tomorrow for Maximum Action.
[333:03.65]That one's going to be a gamer stream.
[333:06.05]So yesterday was like an on-camera dickhead stream.
[333:11.83]Today was a relaxing fishing stream.
[333:14.29]Tomorrow is going to be a gamer stream.
[333:16.67]Because that's a skill-based video game.
[333:26.84]This was relaxing.
[333:28.62]I was relaxed.
[333:30.16]You can't tell me the first four hours of this stream wasn't just hanging out and relaxing.
[333:33.44]It wasn't.
[333:34.60]We talked about cheese.
[333:43.73]We talked about prosciutto.
[333:46.31]That's all I remember.
[333:48.39]We had four and a half plus hours of conversations on this stream.
[333:52.56]And I only remember that somebody told me that I was wrong when I said that Prosciutto is raw or something.
[333:59.00]That's all I remember.
[334:00.78]Talked about the MCU and Far From Home is the best Spider-Man movie.
[334:03.88]I remember writing that in the true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true.
[334:09.02]That's all I saw over in the chat.
[334:17.59]But thank you, everybody.
[334:32.99]Oh my god, Jeremy, I finally found you.
[334:35.90]Remember me?
[334:36.42]We were fishing together, but then I got separated from the group, fell into the pond, and couldn't get out.
[334:40.68]I screamed for help, but nobody heard me.
[334:43.76]This game was more fun than I remembered, by the way.
[334:45.66]I feel like it's fun just to open and play a game for a while.
[334:48.30]Yeah.
[334:51.32]That's what I'm saying, yeah.
[334:52.04]That's right, Snoozycopter.
[334:54.30]Thanks for the $2.50.
[334:57.02]If I liked your election, thanks for the $5.00.
[334:58.54]That was one bad, mad dad.
[335:04.35]Thank you.
[335:04.69]I'm being honest, it was... I didn't even pick that day.
[335:08.47]I gave a range of time.
[335:09.07]And we sort of went back and forth on when it would be, and the 21st turned out to be the best day for everybody.
[335:34.53]So yes, by coincidence.
[335:38.84]Hey, Orange Power, thanks for the $10, Orange Power.
[335:41.58]10 bucks.
[335:46.08]Hey, Jerma, I've lived in Texas all my life, and I'm actually transferring to a college in New York for my sophomore year.
[335:55.57]I'm actually really nervous about being in such a different environment from the one I've been in all my life, but your streams always give me the break I need.
[336:02.28]Keep it up.
[336:04.51]You keep it up as well.
[336:06.25]That's a big change.
[336:10.57]I've never really been in New York for very long.
[336:14.58]But the times that I have spent there, it's a pretty interesting place.
[336:16.88]A lot of cool stuff to do.
[336:19.18]A lot of cool stuff to see in New York.
[336:20.50]Especially New York City.
[336:22.28]Not sure exactly where you'll be in New York.
[336:26.49]But good luck.
[336:29.15]I'm sure you'll do just fine.
[336:34.61]True Bostonian.
[336:35.48]He's never been to New York.
[336:37.14]I have a few times.
[336:38.10]I have.
[336:38.24]I've been to Times Square.
[336:48.20]But thank you, Orange Power.
[336:51.25]Whatever you're doing, whatever college you're going to, keep it up.
[336:56.81]As you said to me.
[337:00.39]Finally, Wolfgang6789 gave five community subs a few minutes ago.
[337:05.49]Thank you, Wolfgang.
[337:08.36]And the last bit message of the night.
[337:10.82]250 from Colusia.
[337:13.54]Colusia.
[337:15.12]Thanks for the cozy stream.
[337:16.16]Now I can sleep peacefully.
[337:18.35]Have a great night.
[337:21.01]Good night.
[337:22.68]Apologize to my cat who you terrified.
[337:24.44]I'm really sorry to Dubsky Dude's cat and whoever I scared from the werewolf that was in the game.
[337:35.54]There you go.
[337:42.57]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[337:43.73]Have a great night.
[337:47.13]Take care.
[337:48.39]Talk soon.
[337:49.63]Like tomorrow.
[337:51.47]Goodbye.
[338:22.79]you
