[00:00.94]Mount Fiji.
[00:01.94]Mount Fiji.
[00:02.68]Yeah, yeah.
[00:07.61]What about Mount Fuji?
[00:09.23]It's fine.
[00:12.11]Somebody asked me what my favorite mountain was in the pre-stream chat, and I said Mount Fiji, because I like Fiji water.
[00:20.43]And I thought for three or four seconds that Mount Fiji was a Fiji mountain.
[00:28.36]That's where it came from.
[00:29.48]But that's not where it comes from.
[00:31.06]Maybe it is.
[00:31.46]I don't know.
[00:32.34]The Fiji River?
[00:35.80]Fiji Pond?
[00:37.69]I don't know.
[00:38.17]I thought it was Mount Fiji for 10 seconds.
[00:40.21]And I was like, no, it's actually Mount Fuji.
[00:41.61]They're different things.
[00:47.35]Fiji is the place.
[00:48.47]The mountain is Fuji.
[00:50.03]Right.
[00:52.45]Fiji is a country.
[00:55.24]Okay, well, is there a mountain in Fiji?
[00:58.17]Whatever it is, that's the one I like.
[00:59.67]That's my favorite mountain.
[01:09.29]Anyways.
[01:10.71]Probably... There's exactly one mountain.
[01:14.91]Well, that's good.
[01:15.35]That's my favorite one.
[01:20.21]Show us your mountain wallpaper.
[01:22.01]I don't have mountain wallpaper.
[01:31.64]Not anymore, it's been changed.
[01:33.58]And you don't get to see it.
[01:35.10]That's from me only.
[01:38.46]But today we're gonna finish Got You Force.
[01:41.66]I have to sell all my toys today.
[01:43.32]I've gotta give them away and sell them and get rid of them.
[01:46.68]I got boxes of them.
[01:49.22]Mom's making me do this.
[01:53.04]She came into my room and said, It's time for you to get rid of all these toys.
[01:58.70]They're everywhere.
[01:59.60]It's ridiculous.
[02:01.77]You don't need to keep every toy from when you were 15.
[02:06.39]Just, Ma, get the f***ing out of here, Ma.
[02:10.35]I want to get rid of them.
[02:11.69]I'm 35, whatever.
[02:12.43]I have, like, toys and s***.
[02:13.95]I like them.
[02:17.11]Leave me alone, Ma.
[02:19.49]Break.
[02:23.13]Toys from when you were 15?
[02:28.15]She doesn't understand.
[02:32.11]Voting to ban mom.
[02:33.51]Don't talk to your mother like that.
[02:36.38]I didn't.
[02:37.26]She left the room and I said, fucking what the fuck, mom?
[02:40.96]Shut up.
[02:42.32]The door was closed.
[02:42.96]She was gone.
[02:44.81]I went, yes, mother!
[02:45.71]The door closed and I went, fuck, shut up.
[02:48.87]Stupid, dumb mom.
[02:53.59]We're going to finish Gacha Force, though.
[02:54.82]I feel like we can get this done.
[02:59.42]Very fun game.
[03:00.44]We're going to see the end.
[03:02.34]Hopefully.
[03:07.24]Vito, please.
[03:08.68]Alright, I'll get to it.
[03:10.67]I'm getting to it.
[03:13.79]You want to see Vito so bad.
[03:15.87]He's going to be on the screen in about five seconds.
[03:18.35]Camera's not on.
[03:19.91]There he is.
[03:21.53]Vito, Vito, Vito.
[03:22.48]There is Vito.
[03:24.10]It's the name of the character.
[03:27.26]I'm so glad that you wanted to see him so badly.
[03:33.09]There's a lot of enthusiasm here.
[03:34.33]I'm seeing Vito in all capitals Holy shit, you guys really want to see them alright give the people what they want Anyways, let's go.
[03:48.22]I'll come back.
[03:48.62]I'm gonna finish this today, and then tomorrow.
[03:51.46]We're gonna play Patapon
[03:54.28]Which, by the way, I actually looked into Patapon.
[03:58.58]It was a PSP game.
[03:59.64]Oh, wow, Patapon.
[04:00.42]It's cool.
[04:00.82]It's such a good game.
[04:01.50]You should play it.
[04:02.74]I thought this was like a 2-3 hour experience.
[04:06.22]Patapon is like a 20 hour game.
[04:08.50]How?
[04:15.48]How is Patapon as long as The Witcher 2?
[04:25.03]Don't worry about it.
[04:25.99]Oh.
[04:28.19]He doesn't know.
[04:28.81]I'm pogging in real life so much right now.
[04:33.88]Yeah, well.
[04:37.08]I'm going to try it.
[04:38.76]See if I play the whole thing.
[04:39.86]Witcher started at 3.
[04:41.00]They don't make games like they used to.
[04:42.40]Alright, let's get going.
[04:46.56]We have our team.
[04:47.32]If you don't know what Gacha Force is, you're in for a huge pog moment.
[04:54.63]Uh, actually, let's do this one.
[04:57.17]This one, this one's like dark.
[05:00.61]Fight in the air battle.
[05:01.93]Alright.
[05:04.62]Air battle, huh?
[05:05.86]Oh, this ain't gonna work.
[05:06.58]We want to see your beautiful face.
[05:09.66]We cannot, uh, look at this mess.
[05:13.48]It's a mess.
[05:14.08]I have to get rid of them.
[05:16.24]I have to start to, I'm not gonna use some of these.
[05:18.98]Alright, it's an air battle, so we need air.
[05:23.11]I gotta get rid of them all.
[05:24.47]Just delete the fours.
[05:26.53]Okay.
[05:34.48]What?
[05:35.18]Why are you all the way over here?
[05:36.02]Alright, Wind Valkyrie.
[05:41.10]And then... Ice Valkyrie.
[05:44.94]Where's the airplane?
[05:45.70]Actually, airplane's first.
[05:46.88]It's an air battle, for God's sake.
[05:50.14]Then... Ring Valkyrie.
[05:57.03]Uh, sniper girl?
[05:57.85]Battery man?
[06:00.29]No.
[06:02.20]Maybe revolver gunman just to like, make people off.
[06:08.54]What should I use?
[06:09.10]Do all the... Well, I'll tornado Valkyrie.
[06:16.52]I still got money.
[06:19.17]And soldier.
[06:23.13]And one more.
[06:23.85]I can do the ninja.
[06:24.85]It's always a ninja.
[06:25.99]Wait, I want level 2 ninja.
[06:26.87]There we go.
[06:27.75]Alright, let's do the air battle.
[06:34.74]Giant sword, ghost samurai.
[06:37.00]We'll see.
[06:37.28]This might have been a dumb idea.
[06:38.82]We'll find out.
[06:43.44]Jump King waiting.
[06:44.18]I deleted my save.
[06:45.40]I'll never open that game ever again.
[06:48.27]That's a fact.
[06:50.70]I ain't ever opening that game again.
[06:56.16]Why would I do that at this point?
[06:58.02]I deleted my save.
[07:08.65]Download a new save.
[07:12.96]I'm not gonna download a new save.
[07:14.76]I'm... Why do I... I... The only reason why I opened it is because I had like four drinks at that point.
[07:27.41]Oooh.
[07:28.93]It's alright.
[07:33.04]Get up in the air.
[07:35.66]It was four whole drinks.
[07:39.81]I didn't just tell you that I couldn't walk.
[07:42.43]I just said I had some drinks.
[07:43.71]And it was like, yeah, let's play Jump King.
[07:45.58]That's funny.
[07:46.12]And then I deleted the save accidentally.
[07:49.38]Alright, this is not going to work out.
[07:50.70]They're not fast enough.
[07:52.52]They're not even remotely fast enough for this.
[07:57.76]It was five at that point.
[07:58.88]Well, whatever.
[07:59.40]Yeah, they're not fast enough.
[08:09.15]I'm just being outpaced completely.
[08:16.53]This ain't gonna happen.
[08:17.51]You know how this happens?
[08:18.91]With this character only.
[08:19.89]That's gonna fly into people.
[08:32.32]And... Got it.
[08:33.46]Okay.
[08:35.14]Same deal.
[08:37.02]Again.
[08:39.75]Any other game waiting room?
[08:40.75]Well, see you tomorrow.
[08:43.07]That's how long you're going to have to wait.
[08:45.87]See you tomorrow.
[09:01.63]This character is actually really good.
[09:05.16]Atapog.
[09:06.68]Look, people have told me to play that for like a year.
[09:10.14]I'm looking forward to it.
[09:20.94]So it's an RPG?
[09:23.48]I thought it was a rhythm game.
[09:35.58]Really?
[09:35.84]Is it like a story?
[09:43.76]Yes.
[09:44.76]Is it a good story or is it a story that's in the background because it had to be there?
[09:50.16]Give me the truth.
[09:55.23]It's good.
[09:56.23]Okay.
[10:00.63]OK, that's nudity.
[10:02.45]Don't stream it.
[10:03.05]I think I'll be alright.
[10:04.37]I don't think that's going to be a problem.
[10:08.21]By the way, I got my ass kicked.
[10:12.52]Is this the last person?
[10:13.62]No, no, I got one more wing person.
[10:16.32]Oh, you're that high in the air.
[10:17.28]I gotta get in close.
[10:31.60]Kill.
[10:33.20]Where?
[10:33.42]Okay.
[10:34.90]Only two or three more?
[10:35.62]This is it, I think.
[10:37.03]Should be it.
[10:42.21]I didn't knock that off?
[10:43.15]How?
[10:43.31]Alright, this is my last person.
[10:45.47]Okay, here we go.
[10:46.31]Let's see if the spam can help me here.
[10:57.82]Die!
[10:58.68]Yes!
[11:00.54]Yes!
[11:03.15]When's it gonna have a meltdown?
[11:04.13]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
[11:05.99]Oh, shit, that actually... Hey!
[11:07.87]What was it?
[11:08.31]Wait, what was it?
[11:09.01]What was it?
[11:09.35]What was it?
[11:09.73]What was it?
[11:10.37]What happens every time?
[11:11.24]What happens every time?
[11:12.54]What happens every time?
[11:14.02]What was it?
[11:15.78]What was it?
[11:19.04]Come on, what's your spell?
[11:20.52]And I crash down here.
[11:22.42]Yes, the Wii Sensor Bar.
[11:23.78]It happens every time.
[11:28.46]It's sitting on top of my monitor.
[11:31.21]And if I move my desk even like a little bit, it just falls and crashes down.
[11:35.19]And it's dude, it's crazy when that happens.
[11:38.45]It's like it weighs like less than like 12 ounces.
[11:44.46]It goes like crash.
[11:45.68]It's crazy.
[11:46.82]And it's, it's worth reacting that harshly over.
[11:48.94]Oh, I got another plane.
[12:02.13]It crashes and I go, what the fuck?
[12:03.77]Even though the thing weighs less than a tenth of a pound.
[12:09.41]He's just overreacting for the camera at this point.
[12:12.86]Asshole.
[12:13.84]Wait a minute, what?
[12:14.32]I got one.
[12:24.49]Gatling gunner.
[12:25.29]Ooh, alright.
[12:31.60]I thought the game crashed for a second.
[12:32.94]I was like, okay, he's going to keep going.
[12:43.98]Violet attacker.
[12:52.77]Ah, funny Gatling go brr.
[12:57.45]Oh, God.
[12:58.85]Alright, let's make an actual team now.
[13:03.52]Let's see.
[13:06.53]Long range.
[13:09.57]Hand grenade and then gatling gun.
[13:14.35]What is a pivoted jaw?
[13:29.19]I feel like his jaw goes sideways at that point.
[13:32.91]Pivoting jaw?
[13:33.73]What does that mean?
[13:44.52]Uh, this is the fastest one, I guess.
[13:47.97]Vulcan, Power Beam, and Napalm Bomb.
[13:53.39]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a plane.
[13:55.13]That's all you need to know.
[13:55.75]Who cares?
[13:57.46]This one, on the other hand, this is different.
[13:59.98]This thing's got a bomb.
[14:01.94]Oh, Power Bomb.
[14:03.90]Alright.
[14:04.16]I'll try it.
[14:04.40]Let's use the planes.
[14:05.12]Are these just the exact same things, except different colors?
[14:07.42]Yeah, they are.
[14:07.78]But they're still good.
[14:08.56]This thing's level 3.
[14:27.62]Now, where's the Gatling gunner?
[14:31.38]I'm going to try you first, actually.
[14:33.20]I feel like I'm really going to like this character.
[14:34.88]420, though.
[14:35.52]That's a lot.
[14:39.32]Who else can I put in here?
[14:45.04]Exclamation point.
[14:46.22]Up dog.
[14:49.94]What the?
[14:50.80]Dude.
[14:54.23]I can't use you.
[14:57.40]That's good.
[14:58.12]I'll give it a try.
[15:03.41]Man is home.
[15:05.21]A big cockroach parade.
[15:06.69]Please help me, Vito.
[15:10.67]There are lots of death force borgs that look like roaches.
[15:15.48]Let's go.
[15:19.98]Ever played Custom Robo?
[15:21.64]Behind me.
[15:22.64]We'll play that eventually.
[15:24.48]I wanted to play this first because I remember playing this game when I was just a child.
[15:30.06]Holy shit, this is awesome.
[15:36.38]Oh my god.
[15:36.92]It has so many... Wait, what does a grenade do?
[15:40.06]There's a really little bomb.
[15:41.13]That's cool.
[15:41.83]Long reload, but...
[15:47.39]He can't move when he shoots.
[15:48.67]He has to stand still, so it's hard to... How many are there?
[15:53.59]I guess I can jump and move and do it.
[15:58.89]Yeah, like that.
[15:59.81]But I can't.
[16:00.25]I have to stand still.
[16:01.97]Still pretty good.
[16:02.45]Probably for, like, those big planes would be good.
[16:05.91]Is this what this whole mission is?
[16:06.83]Is this killing the cockroaches?
[16:22.54]Can we get any bigger cockroaches?
[16:28.94]When's the next brownie rant?
[16:30.86]Ah, let me tell ya!
[16:37.48]Brownie rant waiting room?
[16:39.43]I...
[16:56.63]What the fuck is that?
[16:59.05]I need to know what you mean by that.
[17:05.06]In before... Some of you guys... I swear there's just AI characters in here.
[17:14.06]That have been programmed to just write something strange every day.
[17:18.62]Just, ah, you know, let's just program my fucking weird bot.
[17:21.88]Just write weird shit every day.
[17:24.97]What am I going to write today?
[17:26.63]Hmm.
[17:26.93]What's a bot going to just pull from the random... How about, uh, in before bigger cock?
[17:32.74]Yeah, that makes sense.
[17:33.92]Goshy Force, though.
[17:34.84]This is interesting.
[17:35.66]What is this?
[17:37.22]Monsters?
[17:38.64]Bugs?
[17:39.96]Oh.
[17:40.68]Wow.
[17:47.12]I don't care about this at all.
[17:49.48]Hopefully... Hey, did he read it?
[17:51.58]I want to see if he reads this.
[17:53.60]He did.
[17:53.96]He always does.
[17:55.06]He always does.
[17:55.78]So it's perfect.
[17:57.57]Tomorrow I'm just going to write... Put a cheese sandwich down my underwear.
[18:03.87]It took me two full hours to clean it up.
[18:06.19]Maybe I can probably read that tomorrow.
[18:18.07]Weirdos, get out.
[18:19.97]Weirdos, get out.
[18:21.41]Oh, I don't think you want to say that.
[18:23.43]I think that's like... Oh, that's... I would have to leave.
[18:27.17]You're getting rid of me.
[18:31.56]I think this channel would collapse if that was the case.
[18:38.48]Wait, there's a person.
[18:51.63]No weirdo.
[18:52.41]Weird.
[18:52.79]Don't.
[18:53.27]No weirdos here.
[18:54.15]At that point, I'd be like, alright, well, I'm... I think I'll be done at that point.
[19:00.35]I'd be like, nah, I think that's good.
[19:05.34]I'd be streaming to my mother.
[19:06.52]It's the only one that would be left.
[19:07.64]Alright.
[19:19.04]We all did it.
[19:25.52]She's watching your streams right now.
[19:27.90]Oh, maybe.
[19:28.28]Who knows?
[19:38.51]I think I have the combination of this.
[19:41.33]No, of course not.
[19:43.65]Of course not.
[19:49.58]Your mom heard you say the in-before line.
[19:53.55]That's alright.
[19:54.21]My mother knows this is a comedy stream.
[19:59.34]It's okay.
[20:00.24]It's a comedy stream.
[20:01.86]You know, we talk about comedy.
[20:03.04]We do thought projects.
[20:05.86]She knows.
[20:06.66]She knows it.
[20:10.54]This is supposed to be comedy?
[20:13.57]And sometimes we play games that Jeremy likes!
[20:27.37]No, we don't Sometimes we play video games that Jeremy wants to play That happens to be the last few days No, you have to play games that I like
[21:03.33]Uh-oh, hiccup.
[21:03.93]No, is this the McDonald's thing again?
[21:05.67]No, it's not the McDonald's thing again.
[21:12.16]You guys know how many video games exist?
[21:18.84]To be able to play your favorite video game, I'd have to stream like 10,000 more times.
[21:25.14]You know what I mean?
[21:26.96]Everyone has a favorite video game.
[21:28.82]I can't play your favorite video game.
[21:34.09]How does this bomb work?
[21:34.79]Did he just drop it?
[21:38.47]I can't even tell where it's going.
[21:41.09]I think it's dead already, benched.
[21:43.23]Oh, it's because they're flying around.
[22:07.25]My favorite video game is called... My favorite video game is Jerma hits himself in the crotch with a hammer.
[22:27.38]Yeah, I know the remake of that one wasn't very good.
[22:32.27]You know, just the original.
[22:33.57]You know, they tried to bring it back.
[22:35.81]And it's like, dude, you hit yourself in the crotch with a hammer and like fucked up your shit.
[22:40.21]It's already been destroyed.
[22:41.23]Like, you're going to try it again?
[22:42.04]You can't.
[22:43.42]No, the remakes suck.
[22:54.53]Crotch Smasher Remastered.
[23:08.99]No, I missed.
[23:10.55]No, I didn't.
[23:11.26]Yeah, I did.
[23:13.30]This guy's tough.
[23:15.12]These two are actually tough.
[23:16.68]Okay, be quiet.
[23:29.41]Oh, you fucking dick.
[23:35.15]Come on.
[23:39.90]I got the advantage right here.
[23:41.00]Oh, this is the perfect thing that could have happened.
[23:45.82]He's so far away and his movement is terrible.
[23:48.60]Wow.
[23:49.14]I can't believe that is that.
[23:50.02]What a spawn.
[23:51.14]Unbelievable.
[24:12.59]Wire gunner.
[24:13.15]I already have one of these and I don't really like them.
[24:21.46]Okay, what do we got?
[24:25.90]Too many planes.
[24:27.98]Too many planes.
[24:30.36]I want to replace one of these planes with one of my... I want to try this again because I feel like I didn't get a good representation of what it was.
[24:37.46]Try it again.
[24:44.99]Let's have you go first.
[24:49.40]Just change the music?
[24:50.58]That's all we ask.
[24:55.06]You want to turn the music off?
[25:05.39]No, no, no, no.
[25:07.77]Music's driving me insane.
[25:12.47]Oh.
[25:16.49]Yes, please start it off.
[25:25.35]You don't like that?
[25:26.05]Every single five minutes?
[25:27.38]Alright, let's drop the bomb.
[25:39.26]I get it.
[25:39.62]How big is the explosion?
[25:40.38]It's alright.
[25:42.55]You really gotta time it, though.
[25:43.57]Let's see if I got it.
[25:51.89]Kind of sucks actually.
[25:56.87]This is really bad.
[26:04.34]How am I supposed to hit anybody with this?
[26:09.40]Alright, that was a direct hit and it was awful.
[26:17.68]Nah.
[26:18.66]It's bad.
[26:26.97]Bench.
[26:27.31]$250 for this?
[26:27.89]Let's see how many fucking skins you bought in Fortnite.
[26:43.08]How many for how many fortnites how many like counter-strike skins do you have?
[26:56.62]You get a knife yet?
[27:00.16]Ah, but fuck this guy for getting a GameCube game
[27:12.15]You have two hats.
[27:14.36]Has the hat market like crashed?
[27:16.58]Or are people still buying them?
[27:18.16]Are they still expensive?
[27:26.64]I could have emulated this for free.
[27:30.50]And you could have bought a knife at Walmart and then spray-painted it green.
[27:35.62]Do we really have to have this conversation?
[27:53.47]What is value?
[28:12.61]Somebody kill me because I can't aim at I just blow this just get this get this plane.
[28:17.29]I can't just
[28:22.93]What would you do with a green painted knife?
[28:24.61]I don't know.
[28:26.53]You would put it in your closet.
[28:30.74]And look at it from time to time.
[28:33.48]Ah, yeah.
[28:34.04]That's the green one.
[28:36.98]Where's the red one?
[28:37.94]There it is.
[28:39.44]Look at it for a second.
[28:50.94]What am I talking about?
[28:53.07]Talk about how spending $2,000 on a CSGO knife skin is the same thing as just buying a real knife in real life and putting crayons on it.
[29:02.42]And having your friends come over and look at it.
[29:24.44]Funko Puff.
[29:25.62]Yeah.
[29:27.08]So what's with the criticizing of what you or I spend our dollars on?
[29:35.69]If I buy a thousand Funko Puffs, who gives a shit?
[29:38.45]If you buy a $2,000 CSGO knife, who cares?
[29:42.51]If I get Gacha Force, it's like my favorite game and I want to collect it and it's $200, then what?
[29:47.76]What's the difference?
[29:49.78]There is no difference.
[29:59.74]What about... Somebody said collecting bongs?
[30:03.46]I don't know, whatever you fucking... It's your money!
[30:06.42]What do you want me to tell you?
[30:11.15]What, I think I have an opinion of you collecting bongs?
[30:17.65]Do you have the space for this?
[30:18.99]Well, that's my only... Here's my only question.
[30:20.85]Do you have the space for this?
[30:22.99]Yeah, I got plenty of space.
[30:24.79]Alright, then collect as many fucking bongs as you want.
[30:46.43]He's endorsing bong collection.
[31:04.89]I only smoke tobacco out of my bong with a happy face.
[31:09.42]Alright, well then you can use a tobacco bong.
[31:13.66]Guys, all this shit is the same.
[31:17.88]when you go over somebody's house and they have like 25 bongs with like this one's got like jimi hendrix on it this one's like green it has lava lamps you do realize that you probably look at your like TF2 backpack it's all the same it's just like intro it's like collecting things you know who cares
[31:59.89]Is this consumerism?
[32:01.19]Alright.
[32:03.74]I can tell you guys are bored.
[32:06.08]I can tell.
[32:07.65]I can smell it from a million miles away.
[32:22.43]Unfortunately, your boredom is going to have to continue for the next four to six hours because I'm going to play my fucking $2,000 CSGO knife skin until I'm satisfied looking at it with all my friends over.
[32:44.80]And I lost because of you.
[33:00.74]the argument is you could have emulated it okay so I alright yeah so I I can like I can watch a streamer open up knives and like I can watch him hold a knife in his hands I don't own it though I'm pretending to own it right that could happen
[33:22.46]I could download a JPEG of a CSGO knife and put it on my background on my desktop.
[33:26.94]Is that the same thing?
[33:36.51]That mission was too hard.
[33:48.27]Do I look like I know what a J- Wait, you guys don't know what JPEG?
[33:51.11]Holy shit.
[33:51.92]In the middle of this, somebody gave a fucking ton of money.
[33:55.72]Do I know what emulation is?
[34:02.31]I used Dolphin, like, a month ago.
[34:05.03]You guys are fucking bored.
[34:27.32]Uh, Phylactery Lich gave $250.
[34:28.42]In, that's 25,000 fucking bits.
[34:38.94]And they say, here's money to buy another copy of Gacha Force just for you to flex on chat.
[34:46.65]I don't want another copy of Gacha Force.
[34:58.17]Donating to millionaires.
[34:59.99]Are we gonna do are we gonna bring that up again?
[35:01.57]Fourth house
[35:28.26]Alright, I'm just gonna play my game and I'll talk to you guys in like an hour.
[35:33.62]See you guys in an hour.
[35:40.61]He's knocked an eye.
[35:41.31]We've already gone over the fact that I don't have a million dollars!
[35:44.57]I don't have a million dollars!
[35:48.93]I'm not a millionaire.
[35:50.53]Why do we have to keep talking about this?
[36:10.25]He's lying.
[36:11.11]Yeah.
[36:21.88]Yeah.
[36:44.90]He's lying about the company he owns.
[36:46.58]That would be fucking... That would be... I think that's probably illegal.
[37:05.86]Offshore accounts.
[37:10.33]No, I don't have any of those.
[37:11.53]Hold on.
[37:30.48]Hold on.
[37:30.82]Hold on.
[37:31.22]Alright, I see it.
[37:31.94]I see it.
[37:32.72]I see it.
[37:33.16]He's a liar.
[37:34.34]Liar.
[37:34.68]Let's see.
[37:35.00]What does it say?
[37:37.49]My net worth, uh, between one and five million dollars in 2019.
[37:40.95]Okay, this is, uh, this is one- this is so inaccurate, it's always like a joke.
[37:50.52]Do you guys know that these websites have no fucking idea?
[37:56.17]They have absolutely no idea.
[38:05.48]You know, these websites pull from how many, like, clicks your website got.
[38:12.58]Monthly traffic was 68,000 people per month, which that means he's worth $60 million.
[38:25.95]Somebody showed me one of these websites before and it said I was worth like $200 billion.
[38:34.01]Yeah, that's great.
[38:34.67]So I'm worth like the total GDP of like 50 countries on Earth.
[38:40.17]Sure, I guess.
[38:41.93]Okay, sure.
[38:47.44]Five million fucking dollars.
[38:49.04]Get the fuck out of here.
[39:02.65]Celebrity money.
[39:05.28]God, this is probably like a data mining website.
[39:07.32]Like, why are you clicking these?
[39:20.14]E-Celebrity Cash.
[39:24.50]Well, it's... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[39:26.80]Yeah, calculator.
[39:27.90]Stats.com.
[39:30.00]Jerma985's net worth is approximately $112,000.
[39:36.19]He's a millionaire.
[39:37.77]He's a fucking millionaire.
[39:48.57]How much money did you ever make today?
[39:50.25]$49.
[39:50.27]Let me buy my second Lamborghini.
[40:10.87]That's, alright, okay, okay.
[40:13.39]Guys, the main YouTube channel, I don't want to be completely transparent about the, okay, the main YouTube channel makes about, uh, four to five hundred dollars a month.
[40:32.41]So no, it's not worth a hundred and twelve thousand dollars.
[40:43.08]It's more like 12,000 or like 8,000.
[41:00.66]What about the second channel?
[41:03.58]The second channel as of, as of like this, I don't make, okay, listen, I'm going to be, let's be transparent here.
[41:14.53]So, the second channel, I do not have a majority revenue from.
[41:21.35]And as of bringing on potentially two or three more editors, I am not taking a cent from the second channel.
[41:29.47]I don't receive any money from it.
[41:31.49]It's going to be going out to the editors.
[41:33.23]I'm not going to take a dollar.
[41:36.29]Zero.
[41:37.89]Because otherwise, I wouldn't be able to afford to pay...
[41:42.02]You know, if we have like four or five editors on that channel, I mean, that channel doesn't make enough money to support like four people a month.
[41:51.57]So I've just, I'm just, that's just, I'm not going to take any money.
[41:55.75]Why would I do that?
[42:02.49]But that, the main, we're talking about the main channel.
[42:08.95]The main channel doesn't like,
[42:19.30]You're not paying your Redditors?
[42:21.72]Wait, what?
[42:22.50]Yes, I don't... The editors right now get a majority of the ad revenue from that channel.
[42:28.65]Yes.
[42:29.65]Wait, what?
[42:30.13]You guys didn't think I was doing that?
[42:45.01]And real soon, my cut from the second channel is going to be zero.
[42:50.83]Absolute zero.
[42:51.69]I'm not going to take any money.
[42:55.46]I need to be able to be sustainable to have another two or three people on.
[42:59.64]He's paying his Redditors.
[43:05.54]What?
[43:14.28]The fuck is this?
[43:16.28]Ench the Bomber.
[43:18.22]I'm getting accused of things here.
[43:21.64]Net worth Forbes 100 list.
[43:23.16]Jeremy Elbertson, $985 billion.
[43:24.28]Alright, TLDW.
[43:24.66]Too long, didn't watch.
[43:48.63]Collecting crayons is the same thing as me buying gachiforce.
[43:55.51]And stamps and shit.
[43:56.63]And coins.
[43:57.81]Too long, didn't watch.
[44:13.62]Stamps are cooler.
[44:27.02]No, they're not.
[44:27.32]You think a stamp is cooler than gachi force?
[44:32.28]Now they're down.
[44:33.62]Now I'm angry.
[44:40.90]Alright, here we go.
[44:42.32]Here comes the gunner.
[44:49.78]No! No!
[44:54.84]I got caught.
[44:55.32]I was stuck to him.
[44:56.66]Alright, here we go.
[45:09.07]$112,000.
[45:09.11]What's that?
[45:19.07]What is that even calculating?
[45:20.17]How many subscribers the channel has?
[45:25.26]Gacha Force is an emulated stamp collection.
[45:27.28]Thank you.
[45:30.65]Oh, mirror.
[45:35.20]Subs and views.
[45:42.24]How does like a subscribe to the channel translate to how much money the channel is worth?
[45:47.33]Is that what somebody would... Is that what somebody would pay me right now to own that channel or something?
[45:51.33]Like if I sold it at auction, would I be like, I want $112,000 for my website.
[46:08.22]1 to 5 million.
[46:13.54]112,000.
[46:13.56]10 billion.
[46:15.84]Ooh, I want this guy.
[46:16.56]This guy looks cool.
[46:17.26]Look at how cool this guy is.
[46:27.48]It's the Jerma985 social media platform.
[46:36.66]I mean, that's got to be like the biggest hilarious scam ever to pull.
[46:42.41]Like, can you imagine?
[46:44.01]Like, if all of my entire presence online, right?
[46:49.80]Like, say every channel, every post, every Twitter, everything.
[46:53.50]Twitch, everything.
[46:54.06]What do you guys think would be worth?
[46:56.45]If I would be like, I'm selling it and I'm selling it to any company that's willing to pay for it.
[47:07.29]Probably like 250,000.
[47:08.35]Half a million?
[47:11.99]Half a million, you think?
[47:12.59]Okay, if somebody paid me half a million dollars for this, that would be the biggest joke ever.
[47:17.98]Because the second that it became clear that the Jerma985 Twitter turned into crest toothpastes, you would all leave.
[47:28.09]And no one would ever click anything.
[47:30.69]It would be the biggest scam ever.
[47:37.98]Oh, the Jerma985 Twitch channel just became like... A&B Realty Group.
[47:46.47]You would see the most unsubscriptions from a channel in a one-minute period ever in the history of this website.
[47:58.54]And then the channel would be worth...
[48:01.21]Like, $200 that next year.
[48:04.77]That would be like a $500,000 just to get it for free.
[48:16.18]Just do that, but make another channel.
[48:17.46]What, I just have a mustache?
[48:22.80]I don't want another normal night.
[48:24.02]Normal night sucks.
[48:35.01]Just put a mustache on.
[48:37.59]And just have a permanent voice changer.
[48:50.28]Like this.
[48:50.66]Like that.
[48:52.26]Just like this forever.
[49:00.38]And speak with an accent.
[49:04.13]So I'd speak with an accent.
[49:06.18]And people will think that this is a... Gemma?
[49:11.28]No, I don't know who that is.
[49:14.76]No.
[49:23.95]It's awful.
[49:24.93]It doesn't matter how awful it is.
[49:27.11]As long as I can be consistent with it.
[49:32.31]Like, for instance, thank you to Silent Serenity for the $2.50.
[49:35.99]Hi, Jim, and now that you're running for public office, we're requesting that you release your tax returns.
[49:41.90]Will we all unsubscribe if you don't release them within the month?
[49:47.88]No, there's no reason.
[49:49.08]I don't have to do that.
[49:49.78]There's no reason why I'd have to do that.
[49:51.68]Thanks for the $2.50, though.
[49:53.36]If I did it for long enough, if I did it for long enough, I would be able to fucking keep that up forever.
[49:57.57]It's a good idea.
[50:00.61]Not consistent?
[50:01.41]Yes, it was.
[50:04.94]What accent do you think I'm doing?
[50:06.60]An accent!
[50:07.26]I don't know.
[50:07.60]Doesn't have to be anything.
[50:09.11]It just can't be me talking like this.
[50:20.95]Do the Boston accent.
[50:25.37]Just do Bernie for the rest of the stream.
[50:27.21]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[50:34.92]You know you guys are breaking the number one rule that every friend is supposed to not break?
[50:41.82]Talking about money.
[50:42.64]How much money do you make?
[50:43.76]Come on.
[50:46.94]I thought we were supposed to be friends.
[50:55.09]Rude.
[50:58.13]Fucking rude.
[50:59.73]Hello.
[51:18.19]Bench the bomber.
[51:19.51]Bench the bomber.
[51:21.13]Bench the bomber.
[51:22.57]Okay.
[51:22.93]Alright.
[51:23.17]Thanks for the advice.
[51:26.57]Oh, sorry.
[51:27.79]Thanks for the advice.
[51:30.27]Now, do I put in the dragon?
[51:33.07]I couldn't do it.
[51:43.89]I can't.
[51:44.45]I can't do it.
[51:45.58]What's an accent I could do just forever?
[51:47.68]I guess it could be something like this.
[51:55.70]Where I just add an inflection at the end of my sentences.
[51:59.50]I could do that probably.
[52:01.19]I think so.
[52:01.97]I could do that one.
[52:06.37]Is it the same voice?
[52:07.21]No, it's not.
[52:08.17]That's just changing my cadences.
[52:10.95]That's you.
[52:11.87]I don't do that.
[52:17.73]Put the bomb... No, no.
[52:19.01]Okay, I gotta play.
[52:23.21]What do I want?
[52:23.69]Alright, I'm gonna do Copy Man.
[52:30.53]That's a YouTube documentary voice.
[52:37.76]Is it possible that the Mayans had different technology?
[52:44.18]Could it be
[52:46.47]that astronauts have joined the Mayans?
[52:49.71]Yeah, it kind of is.
[52:54.43]And then even when they're not asking a question, it's still a question.
[52:59.86]Over 200 million Mayans existed in the year 14 AD?
[53:05.66]They're still asking questions.
[53:09.68]You gotta speak with confidence and with sincerity.
[53:20.34]Has a fat Earther voice.
[53:24.08]Alright, who's next?
[53:36.74]This is the perfect guy for this, by the way.
[53:39.81]Oh.
[53:39.91]Don't get killed.
[53:41.71]Don't get killed.
[53:46.03]Fat fucker theory?
[53:48.62]Fat fuck Earth theory.
[53:54.18]Space is incredibly large.
[53:58.00]Scientists predict that over the next 200 years, Earth might spin at 2% faster than it does now.
[54:10.08]Join me in this video as we see exactly how big the Earth can get
[54:19.40]Audible.com is a website where you can listen to music and TV shows on your computer.
[54:24.97]I'll probably spend the next probably four or five minutes talking about this over the course of this 20-minute video.
[54:31.59]We'll take a break to talk about it.
[54:33.37]And I know... But Earth is a gigantic place.
[54:39.97]But what if Earth was 10 times larger?
[54:49.90]Scientists are calling this theory the Fat Fuck Earth Theory.
[54:54.31]We caught up.
[54:59.45]Concentrating.
[55:00.05]Hold on.
[55:00.37]Don't want to die.
[55:06.26]I died.
[55:13.68]Dude, you're gaming documentary videos.
[55:19.02]Is this some kind of joke?
[55:20.91]Maybe I'll try this time.
[55:23.31]Oh, dude, I'm hooked.
[55:33.77]What is this?
[55:34.27]This is a currency thing.
[55:39.75]This is a foot lettuce thing.
[55:57.94]I'm not going to say that out loud.
[55:59.72]You guys trying to drop my net worth?
[56:18.50]Crash is stuck.
[56:21.70]I don't have any.
[56:22.28]There's no such thing.
[56:23.18]There's no ticker for me.
[56:28.24]Guys, if there was a ticker for this channel, all you memers would just manipulate the fuck out of it, and I would be under investigation every day.
[56:39.37]The SEC would have me on speed dial.
[56:42.49]And I would have to talk to somebody every day.
[56:45.35]The J-R, the Jerma ticker has more unusual activity.
[56:51.75]I want to ask you a few questions about this.
[56:53.31]God damn it.
[56:53.77]Okay, what is it?
[56:55.24]Well, turns out, uh, they sold, then bought, and then sold it again, uh, $2 million worth of stock.
[57:02.75]And it looks like, if you look at this chart, it looks like they spelled out the F word.
[57:07.41]Fuck in the up and down sells and buys.
[57:09.87]Are you aware?
[57:10.59]Did you have anything to do with that?
[57:13.26]No, I didn't, actually.
[57:14.22]I didn't.
[57:14.78]How do I delist my, can I go private again?
[57:29.86]No, you can't, actually.
[57:30.88]That'll be a $600,000 fine.
[57:33.28]But my net worth is only $112,000!
[57:34.26]Looks like you're fucked, kid.
[57:37.50]Oh, no!
[57:37.68]Oh, no!
[58:04.59]You already have one?
[58:05.29]Yeah, but that's just like pretend goofy money.
[58:10.94]Every time you buy and sell on that website, somewhere in the distance, you just hear like...
[58:31.73]This is for fun, and it's cool, and I was into that for a little while.
[58:34.73]I thought it was like a cool thing.
[58:39.46]It's like an interesting little... That's a fun little project.
[58:45.18]But it's not like real money.
[58:51.04]This Jerma podcast sucks.
[58:54.47]I wonder if it gets any... And then... Idiot!
[59:01.64]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[59:07.72]See you tomorrow.
[59:10.82]Audible.com.
[59:11.86]Oh, let me see if this gets any better.
[59:16.44]I don't want to listen to that.
[59:27.99]Somebody sat on the clicker.
[59:35.64]Wikipedia, the wee encyclopedia that anyone can edit.
[59:41.32]Why did you say it like that?
[59:43.16]Why did you say it like that?
[59:44.74]Why did you say it like that?
[59:53.53]Wait, that's a meme?
[59:56.73]I don't know what that is.
[60:05.25]Alright, let's bring you, you, you.
[60:09.57]Copy Man didn't even get a chance.
[60:12.83]We'll put Copy Man first.
[60:16.35]And that's... Yeah.
[60:19.41]This is the
[60:36.18]What?
[60:36.54]What?
[60:41.08]Veto.
[60:41.50]Veto just gave.
[60:44.43]Nope.
[60:48.21]Dude, you're up today.
[60:49.71]Let me see.
[60:50.81]Oh.
[60:57.48]Where?
[61:00.18]Where?
[61:12.49]I'm not going to say anything.
[61:13.37]I'm going to just watch this.
[61:14.62]Yeah.
[61:37.94]It's crazy just how this reflects actual stock lines.
[61:45.29]It's always like a top.
[61:47.29]I bet you if you did actual TA, if you did technical analysis, like they do on stock tickers, you could find bottoms.
[61:56.91]You could find like, oh, that's a double bottom.
[61:59.63]That's what we call a... A... A... A... A...
[62:10.08]I might as well be doing technical analysis.
[62:12.32]Because I can't... Yes, it's real.
[62:20.10]Oh, no.
[62:20.54]We hit the double top.
[62:23.46]Okay, I got to avanipulate this.
[62:24.81]I can't look at this.
[62:28.57]We love bottoms.
[62:29.97]Shut up.
[62:41.15]Wait, hold on a second.
[63:04.23]It's like, holy shit!
[63:06.77]Elon Musk just tweeted he's made out of titanium!
[63:10.55]And he'll live forever!
[63:12.11]Holy fuck!
[63:14.72]That's that kind of line.
[63:38.12]Holy, that's the kind of line where it's like, this just in, McDonald's figured out how to print money.
[63:44.74]Each person that goes and gets a Happy Meal gets $100 in their Happy Meal.
[63:52.86]Holy shit.
[64:04.68]Wait, why would they figure out how to do that?
[64:06.96]That's because of the law.
[64:10.30]Oh, no, no, no.
[64:10.70]It would be like, this just in.
[64:13.23]All Cars toys from 2000 to 2005 have appreciated in value by 200 million percent.
[64:24.85]Only the ones in the McDonald's toy box.
[64:28.81]Wait, that wouldn't mean that they... Would that make McDonald's be... Yeah, because then people would be like, holy shit, I got to buy McDonald's.
[64:38.90]Here it goes, here it goes, here it goes.
[64:45.85]Let's make a camel.
[64:56.53]No, don't laugh at that.
[64:57.49]You're not done.
[64:57.95]Okay.
[65:02.56]Now, I gotta say something that's not funny, but that is funny at the same time.
[65:10.11]for like the next 40 minutes.
[65:29.23]Hey!
[65:29.65]No, no, no, no.
[65:33.13]Look at me!
[65:35.71]Giant enemy spider.
[65:50.74]No, no, no, no, no.
[65:53.86]Poopoo, poopoo, peepee, poopoo.
[65:55.40]I have a poopoo guy.
[65:57.82]Poopoo, poopoo, poopoo, poopoo.
[66:06.03]That wasn't supposed to be funny.
[66:07.97]Stop buying.
[66:15.93]What would happen to the stock of like Elon Musk tweeted like pee-pee poo-poo poo-poo poo-poo?
[66:23.77]Would it go up or down?
[66:32.40]It would probably go up.
[66:34.96]It would probably explode in value.
[66:39.32]I don't know what the fuck that means but uh I don't think I'm gonna buy it
[67:14.05]Oh.
[67:17.87]This is such a fun little thing.
[67:23.22]You ready?
[67:43.40]Hold on a second.
[67:44.58]Give me one second.
[68:10.89]Oh, no, no.
[68:11.43]I want to get it on screen.
[68:12.53]I'm not doing what you think I'm doing.
[68:14.21]I promise.
[68:32.61]Holy shit.
[68:36.81]Okay.
[68:37.47]Hold on.
[68:49.13]So let's keep this on for a little while.
[68:52.01]This is funny to me.
[69:11.52]Uh-oh, he's gonna play Ayaya!
[69:17.96]Quick sell!
[69:44.31]see oh yeah this is you gotta see the time okay there we go alright let's go a little too big alright let's play
[70:07.61]So, if you want to see why I thought this was a funny idea at first, and then I thought this was a really, really, really bad fucking idea, and I was going to actually have somebody make an extension for this.
[70:19.63]Like, build out an extension that did this.
[70:22.77]But you will see that it is now... It would be... We talked about this yesterday, didn't we?
[70:31.71]I couldn't.
[70:32.73]It would be all I think about.
[70:33.85]I wouldn't be able to concentrate on anything.
[70:58.08]Quick, do a shpee stimulus package.
[71:25.97]Uh-oh, there was an estimate that there was going to be a speedy stimulus package and it didn't happen!
[71:44.60]Oh shit, all the investors were expecting it!
[71:47.63]It didn't happen.
[71:49.79]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[72:01.02]No, yeah, it's like, it's 430.
[72:02.76]We're waiting for a speed announcement here.
[72:08.80]What's going on?
[72:22.97]investors uh Jerma985 uh comedy investors around the world are are stuck right now they don't know what to do they were expecting this and those that bought in very very early back in 2011
[72:48.66]They're still holding, but they might start to sell.
[72:51.28]We're going to see some real capitulation here.
[72:59.75]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[73:02.07]We got a live feed from Jerma985's bedroom.
[73:05.21]Here he is.
[73:05.60]Sorry, I slept in way too late.
[73:10.62]I slept in, like, way too late.
[73:13.78]What is it?
[73:19.43]Investors around the world are weighing what they think about this.
[73:34.56]That may have been too much stimulus.
[73:36.04]Let's see how they feel about it.
[73:49.80]Hmm.
[73:51.30]Trying... The bulls are really trying to take this up.
[74:06.53]Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
[74:07.91]I'm gonna do this.
[74:08.81]I'm gonna find out how to do this.
[74:10.43]I'm gonna make like a comedy currency.
[74:12.17]That's like built in with an extension.
[74:14.09]So people can like buy and sell comedy currency on this channel.
[74:18.30]Even if it's only, like, active for, like, fucking a week.
[74:21.78]It'll only be live for, like, a week.
[74:24.66]This is, like, funny.
[74:26.34]This is, like, insane.
[74:29.54]Do channel points?
[74:30.34]Oh, my God.
[74:44.43]Channel points.
[74:45.23]Okay, yeah, we could do channel points.
[74:48.02]Channel points for like the IPO.
[74:49.72]Like if you have a bunch of them right now.
[74:51.08]You like got into the initial... What?
[74:54.28]No, ICO.
[74:55.30]Initial comedy.
[74:55.98]Oh, no, that's... I don't want to use that.
[74:57.96]Initial comedy offering.
[75:02.63]No, I don't want to use ICO.
[75:04.41]Don't want to do that.
[75:06.15]Hey, guys, I'm making an ICO.
[75:08.73]No, no, no, no.
[75:17.53]That would be very bad.
[75:18.91]I don't- I would not want to say that one.
[75:23.91]Initial comedy offering.
[75:37.87]It's kind of like, sad in a way.
[75:39.49]When was the last time you heard somebody say that they were gonna do an ICO?
[75:43.69]Holy shit, that's like 2016, 2017.
[75:58.44]I gotta figure out how to do this, because I think it'll be fun.
[76:17.41]Like, they started right next to me.
[76:18.65]I could have just put one of these guys in.
[76:37.18]Bugleberry is going to crash the market.
[76:54.01]But I love Bugleberry.
[77:00.88]I think this could be fun for like a week.
[77:05.05]Have a pretend, like, Twitch comedy traded channel points.
[77:12.96]That's built into, that's baked into the channel.
[77:16.09]And, like, people could buy and sell.
[77:20.39]And you could just lose a bunch of channel points and stuff.
[77:23.05]We'll gain some.
[77:32.49]I have to be very clear, like... I'm gonna be clear now about it to just... I fucking have to say this, and I'm going to say this.
[77:38.69]All of this is a comedy routine.
[77:40.33]Like, this is all a joke.
[77:41.85]It's a comedy routine.
[77:43.93]And nothing... No, it's not real value.
[77:45.47]It's just fake.
[77:46.15]It's just for fun.
[77:46.83]A little joke.
[77:48.43]That's just... None of it's real.
[77:50.21]Need to make sure I'm very clear about that.
[77:57.99]What?!
[77:58.32]I have to say that!
[78:00.00]I could...
[78:08.91]This is a stock market parody without real value.
[78:18.32]None of this is financial advice.
[78:20.46]It never was and it never will be.
[78:30.27]Wait, are you guys selling because I'm telling you it's fake?
[78:32.73]Is that why?
[78:33.27]Oh, no.
[78:35.41]CEO of Jerma 95 Enterprises says that all money in his stock is not even real.
[78:47.07]It's not real money.
[78:50.31]CEO of major company says, sorry, guys, I have to make this really clear.
[78:54.35]The stock is worthless.
[78:57.85]It's not real.
[79:06.23]holy shit that would be insane and this would be funny for like a week but that's all it could be there for because you know because with everything it doesn't even matter if it's not even real there will be little groups that like form and they're like alright at 8 30 a.m we're gonna jump it and then we're gonna there'll be like Discord calls about this and you know it's gonna happen but it'll be a little experiment
[79:53.66]It's already it's happening now
[80:02.95]This is one of those charts where if you owned stock in here, it doesn't matter if it's like 8 a.m.
[80:12.02]or 8 p.m., you've probably opened a bottle of whiskey.
[80:14.94]Holy shit.
[80:17.24]Oh my god.
[80:19.00]What the fuck?
[80:20.91]What do I do?
[80:21.75]This is fucked.
[80:27.29]Do I just turn it off or do I buy it or do I sell it?
[80:40.96]I've gone up and down in portfolio value 100% both directions in 10 minutes.
[80:49.90]Oh.
[80:52.74]I think I... I think I'm going to take a bath.
[80:55.73]I'm...
[81:11.35]I think it went off the screen.
[81:13.32]Yeah, it did.
[81:18.32]And then there's going to be the people that just want to watch the world burn, right?
[81:21.60]And they're just going to sell and buy at the same price and just manipulate it so it goes up and down like a heart monitor.
[81:32.23]No matter what.
[81:43.19]Oh shit, I'm going to lose.
[81:51.10]OK, I'd have to put some like some like rules in and maybe you could only do a certain amount of like a certain amount of day or a stream.
[82:00.38]I don't know.
[82:04.63]You got beaten too many times.
[82:10.98]Oh, I also have to put this on screen too.
[82:12.90]Uh, this is, hold on.
[82:15.04]I don't want people to think that, like, if you just come in right now and it's like, what, what, what, what, what, what stock is this?
[82:19.64]You know what I mean?
[82:22.80]Like, I have, I gotta, hold on.
[82:50.96]Yeah, okay.
[83:39.29]Oh my god!
[83:40.35]Okay.
[83:59.86]I'm kind of... Oh, I just lost right there.
[84:01.28]Hold on.
[84:02.08]Wait, did I lose or did I win?
[84:03.04]I lost.
[84:05.75]It's not supposed to be funny.
[84:07.43]That's not supposed to be funny.
[84:08.67]I don't want people to come in here and be like, what the fuck are they doing?
[84:11.19]You know what I mean?
[84:14.03]Like, oh look, it went up and it went down and then it went up and it went down.
[84:20.77]No, no, no, no, no.
[84:22.07]This is very clear.
[84:23.23]This is a fake MyStreams comedy ticker.
[84:30.20]Somebody just gave $50.
[84:41.31]Kajtek, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[84:43.19]$50.
[84:46.78]Derm, I have to inform you as a lawyer that this concept already exists.
[84:50.70]It's Twitch stocks.
[84:52.34]I'll be forced to -2 of your stream if you do not cease and desist.
[84:56.26]Well, no.
[84:56.82]We're talking about comedy points.
[84:59.94]This is not a stock.
[85:00.80]This is a comedy point.
[85:02.07]Derm, a comedy point.
[85:04.13]Don't call it a ticker.
[85:06.27]This is a comedy point.
[85:18.80]I almost just turned on the webcam and I don't have a shirt on.
[85:21.56]That would have been like buy or sell.
[85:23.98]I don't know.
[85:24.30]That would have moved the comedy points a lot in some direction.
[85:29.53]I almost did it.
[85:31.11]It was close.
[85:44.49]Okay.
[85:45.11]I don't like copy manners.
[85:53.67]uh who can I fit man man girl and alright we have uh come on gwen I like it I like this new group
[86:19.11]You have to... Show it now or we're going to dump your comedy points.
[86:39.66]I'm not going to be naked on camera.
[86:44.31]Yes, if you want to dump my fake comedy points...
[86:49.09]Which doesn't affect me.
[86:52.86]Where being like naked on stream ends my career.
[86:57.30]And then this channel really won't be worth anything.
[87:02.38]And then that little net worth thing that you linked.
[87:06.27]That goes zero.
[87:21.02]I am going to figure out how to get that to work though.
[87:22.63]I think that's funny.
[87:35.82]Oh, you guys are going off the screen.
[88:03.46]Oh my god.
[88:04.80]I fucking hate clicking on shit.
[88:15.74]Stop!
[88:18.68]I don't think that's effective.
[88:22.18]CEO of comedy company.
[88:25.13]Sees comedy points drop by 80% in one hour.
[88:28.35]Tweets stop.
[88:35.04]shocked that it didn't work how do I get this guy this bird guy he's so fast
[89:10.27]Take him out, take him out, take him out, take him out.
[89:19.82]We still want face cam.
[89:21.10]No, not turn on face cam.
[89:22.40]Not yet.
[89:39.32]I love this.
[89:39.90]You know, it's really funny.
[89:40.68]I love watching the people type in minus five.
[89:44.12]It don't work like that.
[89:45.22]Sorry.
[89:45.62]Alright.
[90:14.67]What happened here?
[90:15.41]I woke up in the morning and I saw, I just looked at the chart.
[90:22.57]What's the news?
[90:27.37]Oh, CEO.
[90:29.93]CEO tweeted out picture of asshole with two middle fingers on it and said, fuck all investors.
[90:40.73]Oh, holy shit.
[90:42.02]That's the only way this would have happened.
[90:49.12]This is not natural.
[90:50.26]Why are you buying that?
[91:07.86]You shouldn't be purchasing that.
[91:09.39]Oh, I got one.
[91:16.47]Finally.
[91:17.72]Acceleration Ninja Oh, imagine buying it up I don't care if the guy gives a shit if I see the guy's an asshole
[91:45.50]the company's still worth 6.7 billion dollars what's wrong with you guys who cares there's no I don't know oh CEO tweets picture of with middle fingers and says you to all investors
[92:14.98]And then two minutes later does another tweet shaking hands with two to three scientists and doctors saying he has the cure for every illness on Earth.
[92:27.34]Holy fuck!
[92:29.91]Quick!
[92:50.92]And then the people, the people that bought, like, two hours ago that took a shit and came back, when it's back to normal, are just like, Oh my god!
[93:03.92]I'm so glad I had diarrhea!
[93:06.06]I'm so glad!
[93:08.49]Holy shit, I was cursing the toilet!
[93:11.21]And oh my god, I'm so glad I didn't look at this!

[93:15.38]Thank you, based diarrhea!
[93:44.89]You're gross.

[95:01.05]Ah, Jerma's got a monopoly on the Jerma comedy point.
[95:04.63]On comedy points.
[95:06.55]Ah, yeah.
[95:06.85]The antitrust got involved.
[95:09.53]He's got to shout out three YouTubers a week now.
[95:13.73]Yeah, that was the rolling.
[95:14.87]That was the rolling from...
[95:16.94]from the pretend exchange people.
[95:37.25]I can't... Okay, you guys understand that this has to be complete comedy and complete fabrication.
[96:07.76]Where do you get one of these drill tanks?
[96:09.24]I want one of these things.
[96:11.98]I mean, I'm worth five billion.
[96:13.26]I can get one.
[96:13.80]Not yet.
[96:19.60]No!
[96:19.68]I'm not done yet.
[96:25.11]How dare you?
[96:38.77]Come on, command girl.
[96:41.59]Come on!
[96:44.75]Nice shot.
[96:46.11]Good shot.

[96:49.70]What?
[96:50.28]I can't... Look, I can't... This is why it's only going to be around for a week if I do it.
[96:54.72]I'll never... I'll have to be like... What is that?
[96:57.34]What is that?
[96:57.70]What is that?

[98:35.63]Yeah, why do you have a blue shirt on?
[98:40.49]What's the difference?
[98:58.71]What?
[99:00.41]It's just a different color.
[99:03.31]Time to clean this up.
[99:05.14]Alright.

[99:52.34]I got to clean this up.
[99:54.16]Look at the title.
[99:54.76]I got to get rid of my fucking toys.
[99:59.32]I'm not going to use Spinner Girl.
[100:02.70]Go over here.
[100:03.16]I might need you eventually.
[100:04.14]I want to try the tank.
[100:10.21]And I want to try the... What's Acceleration Ninja?
[100:13.69]Speed type.
[100:16.23]Midair.
[100:17.59]Kamaitachi.
[100:19.57]Kamaitachi.
[100:20.81]And then Ninpo Full Throttle.
[100:22.21]He's got wheels!
[100:22.99]This guy's cool.
[100:25.12]Fastest Gachaborg in the Assassination Unit.
[100:28.19]The amazing speed of his nympho full throttle sends any enemy that bumps into him flying.
[100:33.71]Cool.
[100:37.34]I mean, they're new.
[100:37.76]I have to try them.
[100:44.94]There we go.
[100:45.87]Oh!
[100:46.69]Yeah.
[100:48.97]What animal cleaning I need to do?
[100:53.73]I'll do it later.
[100:54.31]I'll do it later.
[100:54.81]I'll do it later.
[100:55.27]I'll do it later.
[100:57.17]I do that so often.
[100:58.79]How many of you guys start cleaning your room?
[101:01.79]And you see just how much shit you have to do.
[101:04.27]You pick up like three pieces of paper and wipe just the area you can see with your eyes.
[101:09.00]And then you go, fuck, there's so much to do.
[101:13.46]That was a good start.
[101:16.74]And then it doesn't happen again until you need to clean the room again.
[101:23.70]Happens all the time to me.
[101:28.15]+2, better than nothing.
[101:32.09]I don't want to do the boss battle.
[101:34.27]I want to do this.
[101:39.39]I don't know if I like these new units.
[101:46.76]As a homeowner, I know what you mean.
[101:48.40]Yes.
[101:53.36]Alright, let's check the samurai.
[102:03.54]Ooh, he is fast, isn't he?
[102:05.86]He is fast.
[102:07.46]He's fast.
[102:09.76]He's fire.
[102:11.36]Think fire.
[102:12.32]Think fire.
[102:16.73]Think fire.
[102:28.73]Am I getting minus 2 because you guys don't know what the fuck that is?
[102:31.43]Not even Kingdom Hearts fans?
[102:32.63]Holy shit.
[102:36.15]Holy shit.
[102:37.55]Not even Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 fans?
[102:44.19]I mean, Kingdom Hearts 3.
[102:47.13]But the first two.
[102:49.65]Those were good, weren't they?
[103:06.00]Wait a minute.
[103:06.63]That was my favorite game.
[103:08.55]-2, -2, -2, two, two, minus three, minus three, -2, two, two.
[103:13.21]I'm going to do minus three because I love King of Ice 3.
[103:16.63]Minus one, -2, minus three, three, three, three, three.
[103:35.34]In the middle of all this, somebody just writes, Dude, chill.
[103:38.82]Ah, you're right.
[103:49.85]I'll chill.
[103:50.69]You're right.
[103:51.99]This guy's good.
[103:54.59]He's a little beefier than the other one.
[104:02.34]Ow.
[104:04.34]Ooh, the tank.
[104:08.68]Ooh.
[104:13.84]Actually pretty good.
[104:20.71]Really, really beefy, too.
[104:26.24]It's got to be, you got to hit.
[104:27.40]This would be really good against big units.
[104:29.52]Because I can't like dodge that well.
[104:31.96]Oh, that's actually really good.
[104:33.14]Nice.
[104:33.39]I love it.
[104:35.85]Has a lot of health.
[104:38.17]Oh, yeah.
[104:38.77]I guess, no, it can jump.
[104:39.95]Alright, that's cool.
[104:45.23]Lay an egg on spring.
[104:49.97]So you want me to go get like a comedy egg?
[104:53.31]And for like two or three months, make you really aware that I'm sitting on it.
[104:59.61]And then after like a month or two, have it hatch on screen.
[105:13.86]And I've played the Jurassic Park.
[105:17.14]Look at how cute that is music.
[105:26.26]And the thing attaches to my face and starts biting me.
[105:30.02]And I like destroy the room.
[105:31.14]Because it's latching on and won't let go.
[105:32.73]And it's like killing me and hurting me.
[105:34.03]And the stream ends.
[105:46.77]Like an alien facehugger is just like, oh, look at how cute it is.
[105:50.01]Oh, wow.
[105:55.92]Look at him.
[105:56.58]Come on.
[105:57.56]Come on.
[105:58.26]And I'm like running around, like bumping into walls and shit.
[106:04.84]But the thing like is feeding off of my blood.
[106:07.21]We showed them.
[106:11.45]Nice combo.
[106:15.58]And I take like a three week break.
[106:21.66]And I just come back wearing a neck brace.
[106:32.75]Like he clearly is like biting me on the shoulder.
[106:34.74]Like on like the arm.
[106:37.32]And I come back with a neck brace on.
[106:44.75]That's pretty good.
[106:45.89]I think I think that would be fun.
[106:48.73]You spoiled the whole joke.
[106:50.99]Yeah, you'll forget when it happens in like six months.
[106:55.49]Showdown to the death base.
[107:01.14]Put a dog cone on.
[107:02.96]I keep I keep like trying to like put my head over and like lick.
[107:07.64]I'm just like, God damn it.
[107:09.94]Oh, I just want to come on.
[107:12.94]That's pretty good.
[107:13.50]Yeah.
[107:14.30]I'll see you in six months when this happens.
[107:19.98]I put my foot up and like try to get under and like get it off by like scratching underneath like my foot comes up.
[107:35.81]And have like big fake dog feet made so like I can just have like a little bar that I pull up and it's a big dog foot and I can like scratch under.
[107:49.62]Eh, alright.
[107:51.16]Oh shit, this is a real battle.
[108:04.35]Wait, having dog feet is too far, but having an alien creature that hatches out of an egg latches onto my face and is killing me is not too far.
[108:13.49]I must make sure I'm clear on this.
[108:29.01]Oh, this is the hardest enemy in the whole game.
[108:31.19]I hate these guys.
[108:31.85]They have so much health.
[108:33.93]They're so strong.
[108:34.59]They can move so quickly.
[108:35.47]Look at that axe.
[108:36.33]I was trying to go in.
[108:53.24]Damn it.
[108:53.50]Whatever.
[108:53.78]Tank time.
[109:00.37]It's a good hit.
[109:07.65]Even if I have to trade here, it's fine.
[109:08.73]This is his best unit.
[109:12.44]Speaking of... Oh, yeah.
[109:13.22]This is done.
[109:14.12]Nice.
[109:14.44]Look at that.
[109:14.80]Look at the GF go down.
[109:16.44]Another one.
[109:18.00]Except it's... Come on.
[109:23.81]Okay.
[109:24.25]It's alright.
[109:24.59]It's alright.
[109:25.03]Who's next?
[109:25.37]I don't even know how to play with this guy.
[109:31.22]Oh my god.
[109:32.47]Where is he?
[109:32.83]Holy shit.
[109:35.53]This guy's insane.
[109:44.51]He's too good.
[109:45.15]I don't even know how to use him.
[109:51.12]Stop.
[109:57.98]Stop.
[109:59.90]Stop.
[110:02.48]Stop it!
[110:10.50]I love the way he skates around, too.
[110:13.06]What is this charge?
[110:14.14]It's so long.
[110:16.99]Oh, it's just a big AoE.
[110:18.09]I'll block it.
[110:31.81]Come on, you don't even know how to use that.
[110:33.39]What?
[110:38.59]Juggle.
[110:41.74]Juggle.
[110:50.22]Come on, I think Kuz will touch.
[110:58.39]We showed them.
[111:04.33]Thank you.
[111:09.27]So you beat me.
[111:11.05]Vito, I'll give you this.
[111:12.25]This belonged to my father.
[111:13.37]When you have three of them, the gate will open.
[111:16.13]I got three.
[111:18.75]I've got three.
[111:21.13]Why did his father have a death crystal?
[111:34.75]I don't know Beat the deadly UFOs I like this team Stop making fun of kids
[112:17.32]Not a bad graph.
[112:19.48]We're doing alright.
[112:25.56]Can I get on top of that?
[112:29.60]Oh.
[112:32.88]Probably should have picked somebody that has better long-range capabilities.
[112:36.28]I don't know why this is in my head.
[112:44.09]Why is this in my head?
[112:46.67]Destroy.
[112:47.89]Destroy.
[112:48.98]Why is it in my head?
[112:50.50]Imagine not playing Star Fox 64.
[112:51.82]Yeah, I know.
[113:27.68]This thing is better than Spikehead.
[113:30.40]You were like 23 when this game came out.
[113:39.88]How old do you think I am?
[113:50.53]23?
[113:50.91]How old do you think I am?
[113:52.87]Honestly.
[113:56.19]This game came out in 2003.
[113:56.79]How old is he now?
[114:12.70]28.
[114:13.38]The death gate has opened.
[114:17.78]Nice.
[114:19.83]Ooh, I need the dream team here.
[114:22.75]Save the game, it's been like fucking a year.
[114:24.61]I was like 17.
[114:44.34]Okay, do the math.
[114:45.20]85 to 2003.
[114:45.35]I was like 17.
[114:46.03]Let's see.
[114:46.41]I guess I'm going to get a calculator.
[114:48.13]85 plus 10 is 95.
[114:48.51]95 plus 10...
[115:06.99]One hunt 2005 so subtract three years.
[115:10.21]I was 17 years old not 23 my god I'm getting rid of you Let's get spike head.
[115:30.15]He's just very efficient.
[115:31.11]I
[115:33.21]Will I need efficient?
[115:34.59]Oh, you are probably going to be good here because you just didn't do spam.
[115:39.22]You'll be good here.
[115:39.82]We got 300 more points.
[115:43.62]Basically the same thing.
[115:44.78]It's not the same thing.
[115:48.52]Why is he so mad all the time?
[115:54.68]Because I don't even have blood.
[116:00.67]It's just like, it's just liquid fucking gas.
[116:03.25]It's like, it's like a hot, just burning liquid.
[116:05.64]I have like lava for blood.
[116:11.84]Uh, let's see.
[116:16.20]Liquid water.
[116:17.00]He's got Mountain Dew for blood.
[116:21.44]This last slot is important.
[116:28.12]Who do I want on the last, the plane maybe?
[116:30.68]Yeah.
[116:32.60]This plan's good.
[116:36.40]He's got code red in his blood.
[116:39.11]Decisive battle.
[116:40.21]Defeat the cosmic dragon.
[116:45.47]This must be the death gate to the death fortress.
[116:48.95]This place is going to be your grave.
[116:50.77]You wish.
[116:51.05]Let's go.
[116:52.98]Defeat the Cosmic Dragon.
[116:54.69]Who do we need for this one?
[116:59.61]Heavy hitters.
[117:00.73]Like Tsutomu.
[117:01.73]Is it the Ender Dragon?
[117:05.79]Fire!
[117:11.31]Fire!
[117:29.34]You missed!
[117:32.76]Oh!

[117:45.07]I'm gonna kill a dragon with this one guy.
[117:46.55]He's dead.
[117:52.37]There's more than one dragon?
[117:54.31]This game... I think sucks.
[118:03.56]No!
[118:03.92]Stop!
[118:04.34]Turn the fan off!
[118:05.81]Turn the fan off!
[118:16.73]Kill!
[118:18.97]Pissing into the wind.
[118:23.77]Is there any more Ender Dragons?
[118:26.28]No.
[118:30.48]Point blank.
[118:30.96]Got it.
[118:34.07]Point blank.
[118:34.51]No!
[118:39.72]Uh-oh, this is bad, this is bad, this is bad, bad, bad.
[118:47.80]Good thing I got this guy.
[118:57.09]Okay, one more.
[118:58.07]Get it!
[119:01.94]Oh!
[119:05.03]Get back over there and hit him in the head!
[119:08.69]Oh my- How many more fucking guys do you have?
[119:23.24]I mean, here we go.
[119:26.34]That's his last guy.
[119:38.10]Got it.
[119:42.68]What do you have left?
[119:44.96]What the fuck?
[119:45.80]This is not fair.
[119:46.53]Back up.
[119:51.71]Where the fuck is my friend?
[119:52.87]Where's my head?
[119:53.47]Give me that.
[119:59.15]What do you have left?
[120:00.15]This is ridiculous.
[120:01.03]That's the ender dragon.
[120:02.43]Okay, this is the ender dragon.
[120:10.58]What's that mean?
[120:15.60]I gotta get my head.
[120:16.38]Oh, don't.
[120:21.48]Ooh, that hurt.
[120:24.41]No!
[120:25.03]No!
[120:30.53]We need that power up.
[120:39.46]Oh!
[120:39.68]Who's left?
[120:41.00]Alright, Sniper Girl.
[120:46.88]Is anybody after Sniper Girl or is this it?
[120:48.45]Go underneath!
[120:52.87]Go underneath!
[120:53.23]Underneath!
[120:53.53]Underneath!
[120:53.83]Underneath!
[120:54.11]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[121:00.65]Get out from under there!
[121:06.64]Yes!
[121:15.06]That was a secret mission, by the way.
[121:16.26]I definitely got something cool.
[121:20.32]Yep.
[121:21.02]Good.
[121:23.92]I had a plane after that.
[121:24.86]Nice.
[121:25.02]I thought that was my last character.
[121:29.93]Oh, hell yeah.
[121:34.17]Oh, yeah.
[121:37.07]Elemental Knight.
[121:46.45]And a Thanatos.
[121:54.52]100 energy.
[121:55.76]My head aches.
[121:56.38]What am I doing?
[122:00.12]You fool.
[122:01.85]Galactic Emperor?
[122:04.21]You can't stop me.
[122:04.87]The time draws near.
[122:15.77]That's the... That's the haunted house.
[122:22.61]When you're like eight.
[122:25.21]And one of the lunch ladies at your school is behind the microphone.
[122:29.26]Doing a scary voice.
[122:36.22]What happened?
[122:36.64]I already made that joke.
[122:38.70]Do it again!
[122:40.79]What's going on?
[122:45.93]Made that exact joke before twice!
[122:49.79]Guys, I've said every word in the dictionary at this point, so I might repeat a joke or two once every, like, three years.
[122:53.95]Sorry!
[122:57.41]Grown-ups have finally noticed the death force, but they don't know what to do.
[123:00.43]What?
[123:00.61]Of course they have no idea what we are dealing with.
[123:04.37]Right, only gachaborgs can defeat gachaborgs.
[123:10.09]Um, I think if you just, if you were an adult and you picked up one of these toys and snapped it in half, that would work.
[123:16.81]Let's split up and take them on separately.
[123:18.41]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[123:37.39]Elemental Knight.
[123:41.24]Elemental Punch, Elemental Sword, and Elemental Slash.
[123:45.49]This strange Gachaborg's armor is empty, and his life force appears to be contained in his sword.

[130:03.56]Everything's not about face cam, okay?
[130:04.82]Okay.
[130:16.61]Good shot.
[130:17.33]That was long range.

[131:18.13]A chainsaw knight.
[131:19.09]These guys have kicked the shit out of me through the whole game and now I got one.
[131:32.54]What is that?
[131:33.08]Is that a lance knight?
[131:36.16]Holy fuck, we're getting a lot of stuff.
[131:46.46]Come on.
[131:47.96]Is it two of them?
[131:48.52]Is that it?
[131:49.54]Did I get lucky?
[131:50.14]Where's the chainsaw knight?
[131:58.73]There you are.
[132:01.07]Huge damage.
[132:03.74]No weapon.
[132:04.90]Just has wire arm and chainsword.
[132:07.84]Chainsaw Knight is a breakaway soldier from the Nightborg Corps.
[132:11.63]He wields a huge chainsword and can slash anything to pieces.
[132:14.59]Grab enemies with the wire arm and then slash them with the sword.
[132:22.15]Nice.
[132:22.37]Alright, we're going to have to... What's more important?
[132:26.79]Plane's going to have...
[132:30.68]Sorry, Command Girl.
[132:32.06]I know you're level 3 and you're one of the best characters that I have, but I'm sorry.
[132:35.47]I need to try Chainsaw Guy.
[132:48.10]Everybody's selling!
[132:52.04]Sell!
[132:56.12]I didn't save it.
[132:58.70]No, my life savings.
[133:00.08]It's... The plane's mediocre.
[133:07.52]Yeah, but it's really good to maneuver around.
[133:08.90]Okay.
[133:26.18]Wait, is this like having a movie on in the backseat?
[133:32.77]The graph is having a movie on in the backseat of a car?
[133:36.53]What do you mean?
[133:40.21]Don't hurt me.
[133:41.03]Defeat enemy Gachibor.
[133:48.21]It's distracting.
[133:50.52]That's what I mean.
[133:51.00]That's why if I do this, I only want to do this for like a week.
[133:54.40]And have it be real for a little bit.
[133:58.76]Can I pull the whole ship?
[134:12.43]Um.
[134:15.91]I kind of.
[134:20.88]This guy wasn't really made for this, was he?
[134:32.79]Okay, that was not a good representation of what he does.
[134:42.96]Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.
[134:44.66]Missiles.
[134:45.76]Missiles!
[134:51.72]Oh, that's not good.
[134:52.38]Alright.
[134:54.05]Tank versus tank.
[135:03.89]Jesus!
[135:06.57]What is even firing at me?
[135:07.81]Doing a lot of damage, but... What are you?
[135:15.59]What are you?
[135:16.89]What are you?
[135:23.04]I can't move.
[135:24.52]I'm stuck.
[135:25.82]I have a debuff.
[135:37.93]Here we go.
[135:40.55]Melee, not a good choice here.
[135:43.51]Not a good choice.
[135:45.45]Melee was not the right thing to do.
[135:48.35]We need long range shooters.
[135:52.27]Oh, here's the last resort here.
[136:10.74]Holy shit, it worked.
[136:20.69]Give me a hat.
[136:22.35]Give me one of these hats.
[136:29.27]Did I get it?
[136:29.69]I got him.
[136:30.76]One more hit and he's dead.
[136:31.40]I need a hat.
[136:36.74]Where's one of my hats?
[136:41.04]Just avoid him.
[136:41.80]He'll be killed by the ship.
[136:43.72]Ship friend will take care of him.
[136:47.66]Good.
[136:50.43]already back down again guys uh this used to happen to bitcoin every day for like three months you guys are you guys just pretending to be the btc chart from like early 2018. like somewhere in like the mid 2018.

[137:31.40]Ooh.
[137:33.54]Oh no, don't get your ice cream on me.
[137:39.42]He's a crypto trader Redditor.
[137:45.95]I want to keep the melee.
[137:46.83]I like this team.
[137:52.38]Stop!
[137:52.78]There's no reason for this.
[137:55.06]There's no reason for this!
[138:02.62]It's because of the facecam.
[138:28.22]I mean, he's alright.
[138:32.12]How did I miss all those?
[138:34.04]What the fuck?
[138:34.62]How did I miss them all?
[138:41.23]Ooh, this is pretty good, actually.

[139:42.87]It can't go any lower.
[139:44.33]It can't go any lower.
[139:45.87]I don't have clothes on.
[140:07.84]I can't.
[140:10.69]What do you guys not know about terms of service?
[140:12.74]You're not allowed to be naked.
[140:27.88]Don't let him come over here.
[140:38.03]Shoot him.
[140:41.99]No, I did it.

[150:33.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[150:37.26]Okay, you know when your hair is so bad that this is solid.
[150:41.34]I was trying to run my hands through my hair.
[150:44.02]I tried.
[150:45.95]What the fuck?
[150:47.39]I can't.
[150:47.87]It hurts.
[150:55.01]Look at how much there is in just the worst places.
[150:58.05]This hair just in places that it shouldn't be.
[151:01.39]It's just everywhere.
[151:03.63]Like it's all back here.
[151:05.44]It's just all back there.
[151:30.32]Get a haircut, please.

[151:40.10]Are you... Do you... We... I can't really... I can't go anywhere.
[151:48.65]Do it yourself.
[151:49.57]I'll mess it up.
[151:52.35]Could it look any worse than this, though?
[151:53.97]I don't know.
[151:54.41]Just shave it.
[152:06.99]What if I just do, like, a big fucking big ponytail up here?
[152:12.00]No, I can't even do a ponytail.
[152:13.54]It's too long back here to even do, and it's too short up here.
[152:16.90]How would that look?
[152:39.94]It's so funny how you can go from... Oh, check me out.
[152:58.89]Just look at it.
[153:00.41]I have like a second head that's back here.
[153:02.34]Okay, if I were to move this...
[153:09.55]I have so much mass back here that there's probably like a face that's just like... Like sticking out its mouth and its eyes and shit.
[153:16.25]Like I'm hiding another like head under here.
[153:24.09]Too much hair in the back.
[153:27.14]That's... Don't do spoilers for movies and TV shows, please.
[153:35.62]I know.
[153:36.14]Look, this is the worst I'm ever going to look.
[153:38.35]So who cares?
[153:38.83]Alright, this is like the worst I will look.
[153:41.13]By the way, Darth Vader playing a fucking piano.
[154:01.40]Alright, goodbye.
[154:02.50]Alright, we have recovered.
[154:05.88]Thanks for having fun.
[154:13.39]Hey Vito, our town is a total mess.
[154:22.64]Did somebody say I wonder what his hair smells like?
[154:24.52]Or am I just making that up because I saw I wonder what his hair and then adding the rest.
[154:35.52]I'll squash all you bugs.
[154:43.12]No, I said that.
[154:44.19]I know.
[154:44.41]That's what I'm saying.
[154:47.67]One.
[154:48.75]Got it.
[154:49.25]Ooh.
[154:49.77]And they even got a new camp.
[154:50.73]Oh, fixed cameras.
[154:51.84]Fixed camera angle.
[154:52.66]Stupid.
[155:10.15]Why are you getting this close to me?
[155:11.31]You know what my skill set is.
[155:18.21]Okay, I tried it a lot.
[155:20.58]I have a plane.
[155:25.26]Holy shit, I just instantly died.
[155:27.76]Oh, it's because these tanks gotta go.
[155:37.51]Oh, man.
[155:41.73]Shit.
[155:48.28]I got to get in there to that tank.
[155:50.90]He's going to just do that super beam.
[156:08.67]Motherfucker.
[156:14.93]He does a lot of damage if I can hit the damn thing.
[156:16.63]Yeah, I agree.
[156:31.26]He is annoying.
[156:39.99]Annoying brat.
[156:46.84]Holy shit, that went far.
[156:56.54]Catch him.
[156:56.90]You're hitting me.
[156:58.98]He's hitting me.
[157:00.10]He's so dumb.
[157:01.40]I don't want to be on the same team as him anymore.
[157:15.27]Alright, let's clean this up, please.
[157:25.01]Clean it up.
[157:25.43]If you could, please.
[157:32.72]Who's left?
[157:33.56]See you later.
[157:37.84]Making noises.
[157:39.70]Hey, it's me.
[157:40.48]I'm sure behind your noise.
[157:53.71]Alright, can I please run away He's pandering don't fall for it It was a one-hit kill
[158:23.00]This character is, I think, probably the most consistently just good.
[158:27.06]It's just so good at everything.
[158:30.88]That's why him and I click so well together, you know?
[158:47.83]Come on, really?
[158:54.89]This chart.
[158:57.78]I turned the face cam off and all of a sudden... Ooh, we got... I want another command girl.

[159:26.84]Ask and you shall receive.
[159:31.02]Another one.
[159:40.48]Yes!
[159:49.01]Wow, I'm the coolest.

[161:02.03]Yeah, keep that shit over there.
[161:11.20]Don't even get out of here with that.
[161:12.46]I hate when they capture you in that jump.
[161:15.23]That was a nice shot.
[161:32.72]Got keen on what I was doing.

[167:51.14]I'm kind of in the middle of something.
[168:07.77]I agree.
[168:08.23]The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[168:24.70]I finally got to hear it.
[168:26.94]We've been waiting for that for three days.
[168:37.14]Well, that was dumb.
[168:50.73]Come on.
[168:51.29]Hold us through.
[168:53.74]This dude's fucking all over the place.

[169:09.04]You can't even dodge this shit.
[169:16.43]Got it.
[169:21.85]Okay.
[169:22.73]What is it?
[169:23.29]What are we looking at here?
[169:23.97]Cool.
[169:24.25]Oh, hey Jimmy.
[170:01.31]What do we get?
[170:05.23]Barrier girl.
[170:14.02]And... Super frog.
[170:39.76]I have two of these.
[170:40.36]How many do I need?
[170:41.42]Let's see.
[170:54.38]What is Barrier Girl?
[170:55.48]500!

[171:02.66]Charge Gun, Beam Yo-Yo, Charge Shot, and Barrier.
[171:07.57]Barrier Girl was trained as a secret agent, as well as her weapons.
[171:11.69]She also possesses a barrier generator.
[171:14.07]Use her when you need brute force.
[171:18.97]The most expensive character in the game, besides G-Red.
[171:22.91]Alright, let's try.
[171:23.65]I don't really like this thing.
[171:27.32]Speaking of G-Red, let's get him back in here.
[171:41.97]I gotta shrink this a little bit.
[171:50.11]It's blocking my view.
[171:51.07]Alright, Barrier Girl.
[172:06.50]Let's see if you're worth the 500 battery power.
[172:14.59]Let's rock!
[172:18.97]That's a charge shot.
[172:19.77]Bet you if that hits, it's probably pretty good.
[172:23.61]Alright, what is the barrier?
[172:27.59]Wait, am I invincible?
[172:41.73]It kind of I'm not sure it's the greatest thing in the world 500 Oh, it's you
[173:09.48]What's this, like, Jeep thing?
[173:10.48]This thing's cool.
[173:11.10]I want one of these.
[173:11.72]This thing can just, like, peel out.
[173:14.88]That thing's awesome.
[173:34.12]Oh, new car.
[173:35.64]Maybe I'll get it.
[173:44.70]Kill, kill, kill.
[173:45.85]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[173:50.87]Ow.

[174:44.06]Beef versus tank.
[174:44.86]We all know who wins this.
[174:49.96]It would have been... Stay back.
[175:11.05]I octane vehicle combat.
[175:14.77]Yeah, kind of.
[175:22.85]Does every encounter play the same song?
[175:24.51]Yes.
[175:26.19]It does.
[175:28.26]Yes, it does.
[175:29.36]I know, and people probably just... I'll turn the music off.
[175:33.46]It's kind of getting in my head too, and we'll play some other song.
[175:59.32]Simpsons Hit and Run.
[176:01.96]Doom Eternal OST.
[176:03.84]Is that... I... But I need to... Okay.
[176:08.63]Doom Eternal OST.
[176:10.89]I must have skipped halfway through it.
[176:12.11]How's that?
[176:32.64]Play the America's Funniest Home Videos theme song over and over again.
[176:58.65]Okay.
[176:58.87]Is there like a...
[177:03.20]How long... Is there like a 10 hour version of this?
[177:20.11]Well, here's all of them.
[177:22.76]Here's every single one.
[177:27.40]We can... Okay, let's judge these.
[177:31.85]Because this is an eight minutes video.
[177:36.16]I can't turn the sound off all the way.
[177:37.86]I can only go down to... No, I can't.
[177:51.38]I have to just... I have to just turn off the audio coming through to... Just crank AFV.

[178:55.19]Is this recorded with a phone?
[178:57.91]No, not very good.
[179:00.04]No.
[179:23.36]Why does this have a laugh track?
[179:24.80]Well, it's because they used to show clips of people falling down stairs.
[179:28.72]This is long.
[179:35.37]I'm going to be delayed.
[179:38.55]I can't sing along.
[179:53.01]Did they keep the same singer the whole time?
[179:58.46]Okay, that was that one.
[180:08.90]This is, here we go.
[180:10.00]I miss this show.
[180:13.16]This show's still on TV.
[180:20.02]I feel like Vine and TikTok took this over.
[180:32.63]America's Funniest Home Videos is now just every Vine you've ever watched.
[180:36.80]Like, how many vines and ticks exist of, like, somebody falling down or, like, breaking something?
[180:50.96]Or, like, trying to do one thing and then something horrible happens.
[180:53.26]Like, oh, I just dropped it!
[180:56.62]What am I fighting, though?
[181:07.64]Use barriers.
[181:08.32]It's snacks.

[181:33.65]I did it like five times.
[181:44.26]Okay, now we're getting into like the 2000s.
[181:52.85]No, no, too much change.
[181:56.43]Too much change.
[182:06.49]I don't even know what it means, but I just don't like sounds.
[182:37.25]I don't know what it means.
[182:43.03]Okay, this is the lag character.
[182:50.32]She's good, but laggy.
[182:57.18]No, I think she's just leveling back.
[183:05.78]Tempo change to... What are you thinking?
[183:16.37]Is the game... Wait, is this slowing down with the game?
[183:25.57]Why is this video tied to my frame rate on the GameCube?
[183:30.16]Okay.
[183:38.87]This is actually freaking me the fuck out.
[183:40.85]I hate this.
[183:50.49]Emulator, not an emulator.

[184:00.97]Funny things you do, this is you.
[184:12.19]Alright, well, the last, this one's bad.
[184:16.16]This is from like 1998 or something, 1997.
[184:18.22]Eh, not good.
[184:21.08]Okay.
[184:28.04]No, I don't like this one.
[184:29.00]No, no, no, no, no.
[184:29.44]I don't like this one either.
[184:32.17]I feel like it would hit.

[194:52.84]This is the meme.
[194:59.84]Huh.
[195:01.73]Who are these characters supposed to be?
[195:03.25]Are these from, like, a cartoon or, like, a kid's show or something?
[195:13.47]They're from Megamind.
[195:14.73]Oh.
[195:20.68]Alright, well, cool.
[195:22.58]I get it, I guess.
[195:25.04]What's this one?
[195:33.51]Remember when Jerma spoiled Megamind?
[195:37.77]I did?
[195:38.05]Uh, alright, now, alright, alright, alright.
[195:47.66]Let's put on Yoshi's Story OST.
[195:54.30]What's this?
[196:02.76]You don't want to put on Yoshi's Story OST?
[196:05.90]Wario Land music.
[196:08.81]Wario Land 4.

[196:39.17]I know what we're doing.
[196:55.27]Nah, fuck that.
[196:55.75]I know what we're doing.
[197:10.40]This is the Neverhood OST.
[197:11.84]One of the best OSTs ever.
[197:13.52]Terry Scott Taylor.
[197:18.01]This shit is just pops up and down, left and right, every which way.
[197:22.65]Defeat the Kachiborg.
[197:40.77]Okay, there's a little penis music part here for you Holy shit fog
[198:06.66]When am I going to stream the Neverhood?

[198:13.24]But nothing can compare.
[198:14.28]If I can get it to work, I would.
[198:21.53]It's so... You guys would love this shit.
[198:23.75]You guys... I can't believe that Twitch has not been... A lot of you guys don't even know.
[198:29.26]You guys would love it.
[198:30.02]It would be like your favorite thing.
[198:31.62]I'm doing it.
[198:32.40]I'll find a way.
[198:39.45]There's one part that just fucks up.
[198:41.73]And you need like a save file to patch over it.
[198:43.93]I don't even know if that file exists anymore.
[198:47.03]This is my favorite game ever made.
[198:49.76]Yeah, it is.
[198:50.66]It has to take number one.
[198:53.92]It has to.
[199:12.20]Ask Vinny he did?
[199:13.56]Really?
[199:14.72]He'll ask him what he did.
[199:15.49]Terry Scott Taylor also did the soundtrack for Armikrog, but unfortunately, it was a lot of just kind of background.
[199:40.04]He didn't really sing on it.
[199:40.94]I think there was only one track that he actually sang on, and his lyrics are just like this.
[199:45.21]It's just kind of gibberish.
[199:48.77]It's great.
[199:51.29]There's a few tracks on Armikrog that are awesome.
[199:56.27]I mean, not like this.
[199:56.95]Listen to this.
[200:13.06]Where's that, uh... Hold on.
[200:16.29]We'll go back to this.
[200:17.67]Where's the Terry Scott Taylor demo for Armored Krog?
[200:20.85]When he's talking about going pee-pee in his pants.
[200:22.97]You guys would love this guy.
[200:24.15]I'm serious.
[200:24.73]I can't believe nobody likes this.
[200:25.97]I can't believe nobody loves this guy.
[200:27.63]There it is.
[200:42.00]Let's listen to it.
[200:45.73]You guys are going to love this song.
[200:49.07]This is from the Armikrog demo.
[201:22.40]I'm sad.
[201:26.04]I got the giggles.
[201:29.82]Make me do the wee-wee dance till I peep it in my pants and that makes me cry.
[201:36.09]That is why I go boo-hoo.
[201:49.06]Happy bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
[201:52.52]I'm sad.

[203:58.44]Delete this game forever.
[204:00.50]Don't worry, you're never gonna see it again after today.
[204:08.14]Never play- what's going on?
[204:12.69]Relax!
[204:27.75]Alright, you guys have to guess my favorite song in this album.

[205:28.29]Oh fuck, that's a big dragon.
[205:29.95]Okay.
[205:30.17]It's fire.
[205:30.67]Not good.
[205:56.00]I love it.
[205:56.36]I love that this just turned into a listen party.
[206:01.34]This is also a good one.
[206:25.80]Oh, that was such a good shot.
[206:44.50]Don't die to this!
[207:09.06]Imagine dying with this music on.
[207:14.72]I'm not gonna.
[207:15.30]I might.
[207:17.34]I bought this soundtrack as a kid.
[207:19.98]Hey, that makes two of them.
[207:39.49]Why would I... I have the... I have the Imaginarium soundtrack, which is all of it.
[207:44.88]It's behind me.
[207:45.68]I displayed it on my Reddit shelf.
[208:15.17]We're going to do... I think I've played this one before, but... This is from Skullmonkeys.
[208:23.37]When you went into a bonus room, this is what played.
[208:27.53]If you went into a secret area, this is what would play.
[208:31.04]And it's just great.
[208:35.22]Here's a little bonus room, because I know you've had it tough.
[208:40.81]And here's a little bonus tune about collecting real cool stuff.

[209:32.39]There are no monsters here.
[209:35.28]Hey, wait.
[209:36.02]Look over there.
[209:40.56]I was just kidding.
[209:43.05]Don't be scared.
[209:46.09]And when you turn this game off in the real world once again, you won't have to play make-believe or try to pretend.
[209:57.87]Cause I'll be right there when you open your hand.

[210:43.78]I'll never leave.
[210:46.72]For life.
[210:52.76]Hey!
[210:53.10]Speaking of Skullmonkeys, why don't we discuss- How about the Skullmonkeys theme?
[210:58.69]That was- this is the sequel to The Neverhood.
[211:00.13]Didn't sell very well.
[211:01.63]Wasn't a- people weren't really a big fan of it, but you know, whatever.
[211:03.89]Ignoring the gameplay?
[211:22.45]I think I'm doing pretty well considering.
[211:23.97]Somebody said we're listening to bad music.
[211:37.07]Careful here.
[211:38.37]You are referencing probably the number one, my most favorite thing on Earth is this series.
[211:48.33]So, I would be careful here.
[211:50.75]This is like literally one or two of my favorite thing that's ever been made.
[211:55.83]Okay.
[211:56.79]Just want to make sure we're clear.
[211:57.75]Be careful here.
[211:58.41]Alright, be careful.
[212:10.71]Wait, what was I playing?
[212:11.77]Let's do this one.
[212:19.14]Where is it?
[212:25.65]Did I X the window out?
[212:26.49]Did we listen to this one yet?
[212:34.61]Did we listen to this one?
[212:44.13]Put on a slapper.
[212:54.87]This one's a classic, yeah.
[212:55.93]This one's a fucking classic.
[212:57.39]Here, keep this one on.
[213:04.63]This is the first thing you hear in the game, that's right.
[213:07.54]This is the first song you hear in the game.
[213:09.64]You wake up.
[213:10.28]There's no fucking tutorial in this game.
[213:14.12]You just wake up, this music starts playing, and you gotta figure out what the hell you're doing and who you are.
[213:18.62]What a fucking, what a 10 out of 10 game.
[213:27.25]I'm not talking about this game.
[213:29.12]This game's a 3 out of 10, according to fucking publications at the time.
[213:33.52]Which, that's wrong too.
[213:36.52]Played Neverhood.
[213:46.11]I will, I will, I will, I will.
[213:48.63]I promise I will.
[213:50.29]I can't play Armikrog on launch and then be like, Neverhood, yeah, it's a good one, it's my favorite thing ever made, but, uh, maybe one day.
[214:03.66]$150, 3 out of 10 game.
[214:04.12]No, I died.
[214:33.09]You have to read all the Neverhood lore.
[214:39.92]The game was just a huge, there's this huge fuck you in this game.
[214:43.72]I don't want to give spoilers for it, but it's so fucking stupid.
[214:47.52]It's like the worst, like, just fuck you.
[214:52.69]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[214:56.99]Hold on, pause it.
[214:58.38]Those of you that played The Neverhood, don't give it away, because we're gonna have to... We'll see it eventually.
[215:03.26]But there is a massive, massive, tedious thing that you have to do, or you cannot complete the game.
[215:09.86]And it takes, I think, like, at least 15 to 20 straight minutes of doing this wicked, boring, shitty thing.
[215:22.25]Oh, like the game you're playing now?
[215:23.73]Shh, quiet.
[215:35.83]Okay.
[215:36.85]Careful here.
[215:39.55]Careful?
[215:40.01]I enjoy you.
[215:43.78]But be careful.
[215:44.52]Understand?
[215:46.78]You're talking about one of my... This is definitely not one of my favorite things I've ever made.
[215:53.14]This is probably like somewhere... I don't know.
[215:56.86]Maybe top 100?
[215:57.66]No.
[215:57.90]Probably like 101.
[215:58.64]This could be 101. 101.
[216:09.31]Dude, listen to my gamer noises.
[216:10.61]You don't get to hear these when there's no sound.
[216:12.13]This game sucks, admit it.
[216:19.78]Why would I stream this game for three days in a row if I thought it sucked?
[216:23.10]Why would I do that?
[216:29.13]Just to bite you.
[216:30.17]I actually think we're probably getting close to the end.
[216:35.13]Ow.
[216:49.79]Why does chat hate this game?
[216:54.01]I don't think they do.
[216:56.78]I think it's, I think it's like, I don't think it's very, I think it's only like a few people.
[217:00.76]I think, I don't think it's true.
[217:09.29]I think people think this is sick.
[217:13.25]I'm going to keep the flying saucer, though.
[217:14.27]It's good.
[217:15.30]I do think we're getting close to the end of the game, though.
[217:17.66]And I'm not going to do, like, new game plus, new game plus, new game plus.
[217:20.44]Don't worry.
[217:22.10]Just enjoying a thing that I like.
[217:24.48]And I know that a lot of people like it, too, because they've told me I've gotten two or three DMs in the last week.
[217:35.12]One of which is hoping to go fuck myself.
[217:38.18]But the other two...
[217:40.34]were about this game seems kind of fun.
[217:42.28]I hope you keep playing it.
[217:44.05]So two, yeah, that's enough.
[217:54.70]Here comes the big battle.
[217:57.90]Ooh, you have a helicopter now.
[218:08.97]Guillermo, what about the comedy points?
[218:10.17]What about it?
[218:12.97]They look alright.
[218:21.62]Wait, does that come out of the bottom?
[218:22.90]I'm trying to figure out what this thing does.
[218:25.06]I think it comes out of the bottom.
[218:36.51]This thing's really good.
[218:39.03]Holy shit.
[218:39.61]That was an instant kill.
[218:50.64]Whoa.
[218:51.88]Actually, I don't like it.
[218:52.60]I don't like that thing.
[218:55.79]Get replaced.
[218:56.27]It's too expensive.
[219:08.61]Swim down?
[219:09.41]What do you mean swim down?
[219:11.45]What does swim down mean?
[219:30.76]Yeah.
[219:32.12]Just stand still and spam.
[219:33.38]It works.
[219:43.80]So is there like a Patapon bundle on PlayStation 4 or is it just the first one that's available?
[219:50.18]And is it a scenario where Patapon 2 is just Patapon 1 but better?
[219:54.07]Kind of like the Pikmin games.
[219:59.55]Does it matter?
[220:07.93]Yeah, Patapon 2 is so much better.
[220:10.63]Patapon 2 is a straight upgrade.
[220:16.33]Holy shit.
[220:17.55]Look at this tank.
[220:19.53]What?
[220:22.19]I think this is a bug.
[220:23.30]I don't think that's supposed to be like that.
[220:25.28]Patapon 3 sucks.
[220:35.20]So should I play Patapon 2?
[220:38.43]Or should I start at Patapon 1?
[220:47.42]Two is really good.
[220:56.54]Play -2.
[220:58.98]Don't play any video games.
[221:05.50]Two is just one, but better.
[221:11.46]Ooh.
[221:13.12]Catra Witch.
[221:19.77]Jerma what is this an unofficial poll that doesn't mean that has that doesn't mean anything gotcha man I don't care I like his voice I love gotcha force I hate gotcha force so so 26 percent of people whatever play two then one then replay two what are you talking about
[221:53.25]I'm getting rid of the saucer.
[221:54.15]It's too much money and it's too hard to use.
[221:56.79]What do you do?
[221:59.87]Oh.
[222:00.99]Pretty weak.
[222:02.81]Stick of enlarge.
[222:04.28]Wait.
[222:05.52]That's what that is.
[222:06.98]Big spell.
[222:10.38]We can magnify others with the big spell.
[222:12.66]I have to try it.
[222:21.84]480 left.
[222:22.50]Uh, get rid of you.

[223:27.72]These are getting more and more intense.
[223:35.55]Remember when this was organized?
[223:36.79]Yeah.
[223:39.61]Please vote.
[223:40.03]Your vote counts.
[223:41.25]Is this a different poll?

[224:56.85]Come on, spawn!
[225:03.78]This can take forever!
[225:04.58]How many dragons are there?
[225:16.97]Each one's a thousand, so there's probably seven more.
[225:32.05]Oh, come on.
[225:32.71]I just got caught in a double beam.

[237:44.49]Oh, no, don't time that person out.
[237:52.43]You say you're getting tired of lettuce and tomato hamburgers in this town that don't quite make it?
[237:56.59]Yeah!
[237:57.45]You say that just once you'd like your hamburger hot and your lettuce and tomato cool and crisp all at the same time?
[238:03.52]Yeah!
[238:04.30]Well, I say you got it.
[238:06.16]I'm talking McDonald's new lettuce and tomato hamburger, the McDLT.
[238:10.57]I'm talking quarter pound of beef on the hot, hot side.
[238:13.27]And the hot stays hot.
[238:15.35]The new McDLT.
[238:16.85]Hot, hot.
[238:17.57]Crisp lettuce and tomato on the cool, cool side.
[238:20.01]And the cool stays cool.
[238:21.99]The new McDLT.
[238:23.59]Cool crisp.
[238:24.37]The beef stays hot.
[238:25.59]The cool stays crisp.
[238:26.95]Put it together, you can't resist.
[238:28.77]The hottest taste, the coolest dish.
[238:31.44]Keep it hot, hot.
[238:40.90]Why am I such a shill for McDonald's?
[238:43.18]I love McDonald's.
[238:44.19]It's like my favorite place.

[239:35.39]I hate you.
[239:35.79]I hate you.
[239:55.92]What's the point of this?
[239:57.24]Can I drop it on his head?
[240:03.60]He hates him.
[240:04.26]Alright, just kill this guy.
[240:09.20]Yeah, you can drop it on their head.
[240:13.56]Now we get to actually see how useful this person is.
[240:15.48]That shotgun's got to be real close.
[240:20.73]I'm going to try to get in close to one of these guys.
[240:26.89]Like this.
[240:27.99]Oh!
[240:29.41]Oh!
[240:32.88]Alright, what about the charged long shot?
[240:37.78]Holy shit, that looked insane.

[241:23.20]What are you doing?
[241:24.22]Holy fuck.
[241:24.78]It does hurt a lot.
[241:28.80]Shit.
[241:29.52]He's so good.
[241:39.97]Oh, I got it.
[241:45.13]Damn it.
[241:47.81]Still hit it.
[241:48.49]Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit.
[242:00.51]Oh, it's okay.
[242:02.13]We got our dragon.
[242:16.23]Ice Dragon's pretty good.
[242:23.22]Wait, it's the Israel Dragon?
[242:29.08]Hold on, wait.

[244:01.71]I get excited.
[244:02.55]I am an excitable person.
[244:03.63]You have a problem with that?
[244:09.92]Turn off.
[244:10.58]If you got a problem with that, turn off the stream.
[244:13.76]Or what?
[244:22.75]Okay.
[244:25.97]Oh, no.
[244:27.19]End of the stream.
[244:28.13]End of the stream, boys.
[244:30.47]No, not yet.
[244:30.91]I want to beat this.
[244:34.28]I got two of these, though.
[244:35.00]That's good.
[244:35.34]Mm-mm.
[244:47.93]Ooh.
[244:49.43]Oh, I don't want a construction robot.
[244:50.99]Stupid.
[244:51.33]Is this game on Steam that would be awesome if it was if they just remade it?
[244:57.40]Added more stuff and made it more like multiplayer and stuff and balance it.
[245:00.42]I got a data crystal for one of these and then just got one of these.
[245:05.46]Oh my.
[245:05.68]It's like fucking Christmas.
[245:15.59]I want that guy.
[245:27.05]Garrett, I don't like this guy.
[245:28.09]He's kind of dumb.
[245:32.36]390.
[245:33.06]No.
[245:35.08]I do like Woody.
[245:35.84]Oh, I can do a command girl.
[245:37.34]Yeah, that's good.
[245:39.60]I like this team.
[245:44.48]Defeat the girlborg unit.

[246:52.65]Kill the medic first.
[246:55.05]I've played games before.
[247:11.38]Wake up!
[247:14.73]I just shotgunned her in the face.
[247:16.41]Oh my god, that guy didn't even get to spawn.
[247:31.42]Boom!
[247:38.98]No heal, no heals, no heals.
[247:40.39]Boom!
[247:48.72]All healers.

[248:01.39]Alright, just get in.
[248:02.17]Nice shot.
[248:07.82]The hell out of here.
[248:09.02]Oh, he actually punches.
[248:10.12]That's cool.
[248:23.71]Am I ever going to do a secret EUTF2 stream?
[248:27.95]That's very dumb.
[248:30.82]Very dumb.
[248:31.50]I'm sorry.
[248:48.56]Did I hit it?
[248:49.00]No.
[248:54.42]Oh, you healed, you piece of shit.
[249:05.76]I did some good damage.
[249:06.64]I'm good.
[249:07.08]I did some good damage.
[249:07.66]Check up the dragon.
[249:08.30]Okay.
[249:19.55]I gotta land.
[249:26.89]Step.
[249:35.19]Turn.
[249:37.09]Now I got the range.
[249:38.37]Big mistake.
[249:43.37]What the hell were you thinking knocking me
[249:55.88]Get it.
[249:56.84]Just fire.
[250:03.81]Two huge distractions.
[250:05.05]This is good.
[250:17.70]Ice Dragon is so good.
[250:22.53]This is supposed to be long and difficult.
[250:26.25]But not with the Ice Dragon.
[250:29.59]Hey, you got a long way to go.
[250:30.43]Come on over here.
[250:39.51]Oh, hi.
[250:50.00]Don't bounce him around too much.
[250:58.08]The Flog Pyro would destroy you.
[251:03.93]Well, that would be assuming that the Flog Pyro was in the game for more than five minutes without getting vote kicked.
[251:09.47]Another Wire Girl?
[251:34.37]So many of these random crystals.
[251:36.49]I don't have... I don't have all the capabilities to combine them, though.
[251:40.59]Another one?
[251:49.01]Damn, okay.
[251:55.62]What's this one?
[251:56.80]Defeat the Wing and Angel Borg.
[252:00.22]Beat the diver unit.
[252:03.28]Training.
[252:05.58]Mr. Reverse Bolt.
[252:09.04]Beat the bombing unit.
[252:12.22]Cold battle.
[252:13.02]I think I want to do Mr. Reverse Bolt.
[252:15.10]Does this game ever end?
[252:26.27]Yeah, it does.
[252:27.94]I think so.
[252:30.14]I'm not doing a fourth stream.
[252:33.66]I promise you that.
[252:45.12]I do love this game.
[252:46.46]It's fun just to fly around and do do do do do do.
[252:55.49]If this streamer enjoys things, how dare he.
[253:00.66]You're supposed to talk about how the Razor Death Adder sucks.
[253:04.70]He's not supposed to like this.
[253:23.81]What will be your new mouse?
[253:25.65]I don't know.
[253:26.10]I only know the Death Adder.
[253:28.16]It's the only thing I know.
[253:30.64]So I have no idea.
[253:31.50]I don't like a shitload of buttons and I don't like... I don't like it to be all jagged and like metal and shit.
[253:42.55]I just like a big palm mouse with two good, easily clickable mouse pointers.
[253:48.06]And then just two or three big buttons on the side.
[253:52.80]On the thumb side.
[253:55.90]You go to like the Best Buy and you go to the mice.
[253:59.28]And some of these things are fucking Transformers.
[254:01.85]I don't want that.
[254:02.55]It's like, well, that's annoying to me.
[254:08.27]I just want a big palm mouse.
[254:14.77]But I want there to be buttons and I want to have like decent DPI and decent scaling.
[254:21.14]And have a good optical ratio on it.
[254:34.14]Wow, you went across the whole map.
[254:48.96]G Pro Wireless?
[254:50.34]What's G Pro Wireless?
[254:52.07]I don't want a wireless mouth either.
[254:55.21]If I have wireless mouth, they... No.
[255:00.29]Because I can feel the input delay.
[255:02.49]It's like 2 milliseconds, but I know it's there.
[255:05.30]I don't want a wireless mouth.
[255:11.04]I can feel the Bluetooth delay.
[255:13.48]I don't want it.

[281:00.94]My Jump King LOL.
[281:04.53]That's funny.
[281:06.21]That's funny.
[281:13.87]Alright, I gotta tell you, it's not a big deal.
[281:16.36]Like, I don't care that I did that.
[281:19.00]I'm not all broken up about this.
[281:22.72]Is it like, ah, shit, no.
[281:24.50]And one of my, like, gamer achievements isn't available to look at anymore.
[281:28.46]But it is.
[281:31.02]I streamed it.
[281:32.00]I could watch it if I wanted to.
[281:46.71]One more!
[281:49.35]I'm so glad I got this.
[281:50.23]I got the good roll and I got the Ice Dragon.
[281:53.19]Did you just watch me beating Jump King?
[282:04.45]No.
[282:17.59]I already have one of these.
[282:28.97]Can you skip the unlocking sequences?
[282:30.84]No, you can't.
[282:31.36]Alright, do the ones that are in the fire.
[282:36.86]Defeat the vehicle unit.
[282:41.59]Let's go.
[282:55.76]it's clear how this is going to anyone know how much longer there is anybody know like does anybody know I don't know it's at least two hours is there really I feel like it wasn't that long
[283:25.00]Nobody knows You've done side missions of all stream Well, we had a few distractions one of them's on screen right now Oh
[283:51.56]Just do the right missions and it'll be about 30 minutes.
[283:55.72]But let's go.
[283:57.10]I have to complete this.
[284:00.64]Even if I play the same character and do the same attack over and over again, I'm gonna win.
[284:13.00]Where are the missions?
[284:21.74]I was explicitly told... I was told... What's going on?
[284:40.36]Do the kid mission.
[284:52.64]Use Jelly Diver now.
[284:53.86]No.
[284:55.18]I'll put Jelly Diver in in the last two missions.
[285:12.03]We just have the two most overpowered things.
[285:14.40]There's a giant ship and a giant dragon.
[285:18.80]I won't be beaten.
[285:22.45]Pretty good voice.
[285:22.95]What did he say?
[285:30.52]What's with the... I thought there was a no anime game policy.
[285:39.82]This is like... What do you mean anime?
[285:47.29]When have I ever said that policy?
[285:51.20]That's not my policy.
[286:03.19]The kid's getting talk.
[286:08.92]Just because I don't want to play Doki Doki Literature Club does not mean I have a policy where I won't play a game that has an animated character in it.
[286:17.23]More of these?
[286:17.67]Training with these people.
[286:25.14]Why will I not play Doki Doki Literature Club?
[286:28.14]Because I don't wanna.
[286:33.19]I already know.
[286:34.05]I already know everything.
[286:35.77]I don't even need to do it.
[286:37.43]Remember how hard these were until I got Ice Dragon?
[286:57.73]Turn.
[287:01.67]Turn.
[287:04.13]Do you remember how challenging this game was for me a little bit?
[287:08.97]I had to jump around, dive, dive, dive, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[287:13.21]Oh.
[287:15.23]I am powerful.
[287:16.56]I am the overpowered character.
[287:21.82]No anime game calls it.
[287:23.84]I played that...
[287:25.38]Reseteer Shop Game.
[287:29.08]It's like a hyper-anime game.
[287:33.95]Because every time I pressed the A button in that game, the character would go... That was every A button pressed.
[287:54.87]I had I thought it was fun Apologize I didn't say what you said I said die choke at ISTA which means God help us
[288:25.93]it means like help help me here it is somebody just linked it click it oh cool uh magnet robot crash
[288:54.07]It means, are you okay?
[288:55.27]Wait, I think I got it.
[288:58.61]No, what the fuck?
[289:00.01]How?
[289:12.74]Did I get two Cs?
[289:18.60]No, I want, no.
[289:25.42]C, B, A, oh, I need four.
[289:28.02]There's a D somewhere.
[289:33.40]God damn it.
[289:43.55]Hi.
[289:44.59]Hi.
[289:45.61]Negative.
[289:50.67]That was just every stream I do.
[290:02.61]Just me talking at first, and then you guys.
[290:05.73]What are you gonna do?
[290:13.05]No, don't fight me.
[290:17.65]Just stand still while I press X and win.
[290:21.55]Stop fighting me.
[290:22.35]You're supposed to just loot.
[290:39.32]Dude, you've lost.
[290:45.58]You just did the thing.
[290:46.48]It's not even good.
[290:49.21]This team sucks.
[290:49.77]This team's fucking terrible.
[290:51.03]This team's fucking awful.
[290:55.15]He just did it.
[290:55.71]Not yet.
[291:11.18]Look at that damage.
[291:16.62]Yes.
[291:17.58]Burn.
[291:19.62]Burn.
[291:35.09]Oh, it is.
[291:35.57]What happened?
[291:47.35]I'm just over here, just playing.
[291:53.09]Is the game over yet?
[291:54.13]Not yet.
[291:54.56]I'm getting so many characters.
[292:07.10]Where were this at the beginning of the game?
[292:16.57]Oh, I need to try it.
[292:29.60]Oh, I need to try it.
[292:32.96]Dude, that's going against.
[292:33.92]Defeat the death force unit.
[292:38.67]Defeat the bombing unit.
[292:39.65]Defeat the death force unit.
[292:43.93]Oh, it's going against the strategy.
[292:45.15]Use jelly diver.
[292:45.97]No.
[292:47.47]Okay, fine, here.
[292:56.16]It's been so long since he pressed a button other than X. I press B sometimes.
[293:15.75]I do.
[293:28.41]This is too good.
[293:29.23]Why would I do anything else?
[293:33.50]He's calling me a furry?
[293:53.12]No, I'm not actually the term is fucking scaly OCOs We told me that like these two years ago.
[294:01.18]So on this stream What was that what was that Yeah
[294:25.61]You know how many times I've been corrected on this stream about what is and what isn't a furry?
[294:31.70]By the way, if you have a frog, you're not a furry.
[294:33.72]You're like an amphibioid or something, right?
[294:42.02]What is it?
[294:48.57]Wait, how could a frog be a... That doesn't make any sense.
[294:54.53]It's a scaly.
[294:56.67]How is a frog scaly?
[294:58.63]Doesn't make any sense.
[294:59.31]A slimy.
[295:00.11]Is that what they're called?
[295:02.19]Be real with me here.
[295:06.05]Stop.
[295:06.59]I'm just telling you what I've been told.
[295:08.97]You're here to correct me and help me understand these things.
[295:26.65]So, is Slimer a Scaly?
[295:38.90]Yes.
[295:47.21]Oh, my computer is crashing.
[296:03.00]Fucking game sucks.
[296:18.05]What is making that teacher noise?
[296:37.71]This is the last one.
[296:49.63]Finally.
[296:52.91]This is the weirdest Counter-Strike Rats level ever.
[296:55.45]Probably gonna get a Bomber.
[297:09.57]Time Bomber.
[297:23.13]Remote Bomber.
[297:28.02]It looks like we have another problem.
[297:30.16]Watch out, Vito.
[297:30.78]We're receiving a strong signal from the Death Force.
[297:33.84]Look at the greater Tri-City area.
[297:37.17]It's a huge monster.
[297:39.11]What?
[297:43.51]A gigantic battle.
[297:44.45]Defeat the cyber death dragon.
[297:50.11]What?
[297:54.82]I didn't save the game in like an hour.
[298:08.34]Alright, Cyber Death Dragon versus... Let's do an edit here.
[298:14.00]We want jelly.
[298:14.92]We want jelly.
[298:17.04]Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly.
[298:18.66]Alright, fine.
[298:24.22]I want to put in... What is Time Bomber?
[298:27.93]Unborg.
[298:29.41]Set bomb, bomb shot.
[298:30.49]Put it with bombs.
[298:34.95]Sounds too hard to do.
[298:37.15]Remote Bomber.
[298:41.20]Does that bomb detonate?
[298:43.39]They both did the same thing.
[298:48.35]What was that wrestling group back in the 90s?
[298:51.75]The guys with the spikes.
[298:52.69]The Legion of Doom.
[298:54.26]I'm going to put this guy in because he reminds me of the Legion of Doom.
[299:01.72]And where was the jelly guy?
[299:11.85]I don't know where the fuck he is.
[299:13.26]I'm gonna dump this whole box of toys in the recycling bin.
[299:19.36]Oh, wait!
[299:19.68]There's a worm!
[299:20.24]Okay, I'm gonna take the dragon out for now.
[299:23.26]I know.
[299:23.48]You're gonna go in the one good spot.
[299:25.16]You're like your own house.
[299:26.22]Okay, and... There you are. 710...
[299:38.59]You too, I'll try you.
[299:40.29]You're like a arrow.
[299:44.22]Punai, shuriken, and ninpo kagenyu arrow.
[299:51.36]Bind enemies to the ground.
[299:52.54]Ooh, we'll try it.
[299:53.62]110.
[299:54.40]Oh!
[300:02.22]No.
[300:03.38]Who's four?
[300:03.90]Anybody less than four?
[300:05.42]330.
[300:07.08]I already have a woody gunman.
[300:20.79]Who do I put in?
[300:21.57]Oh, yeah.
[300:22.83]No, he's four.
[300:23.45]No.
[300:25.45]Here we go.
[300:27.73]Let's try it.
[300:30.42]Alright, defeat the giant enemy dragon.
[300:43.35]Again, that's another stream that I've done.
[300:56.80]This team sucks.
[300:57.62]I don't even know what the bug does.
[301:06.71]Wait.
[301:09.36]Oh, I get it.
[301:15.22]He shoots out these spikes.
[301:18.90]They stay?
[301:19.62]They stay.
[301:30.84]And he puts them down behind him, too.
[301:40.15]This is kind of cool, but terrible at the same time.
[301:48.99]Just make death traps for everybody.
[301:50.61]So loud.
[302:09.42]Ooh, let's do it.
[302:11.85]You're annoying.
[302:13.62]Anybody ever tell you that?
[302:25.96]Die.
[302:26.50]Come on.
[302:27.98]It's like the final battle.
[302:30.42]Here he comes.
[302:37.59]Fuck.
[302:37.93]Didn't do anything.
[302:54.91]Whoa.
[303:00.51]Fuck.
[303:00.73]Okay.
[303:02.69]Oh, this dude.
[303:03.39]Are they blowing up on it?
[303:15.40]I didn't read the instruction manual.
[303:18.54]Is it working?
[303:24.02]I did it!
[303:57.56]I'm the character that puts the suit on and has no idea how it works.
[304:03.87]But the suit is doing all kinds of powers.
[304:06.53]Where is it taking me?
[304:07.45]Whoa!
[304:09.82]I'll handle this, Jeremy.
[304:11.10]I'll handle this?
[304:12.42]What are you talking about?
[304:13.96]Whoa!
[304:29.82]He's dead.
[304:30.46]No, I'm dead.
[304:32.56]Jello.
[304:37.65]Oh, slow motion in here.
[304:45.83]He's great.
[304:54.93]I just need to get that back and do it again.
[305:12.51]Oh, this is bad.
[305:13.49]I actually might still do it somehow.
[305:15.47]Magically.
[305:17.89]If I get another one of those things... Who's last?
[305:21.99]Somebody's last.
[305:24.46]I have one or two more people left.
[305:25.70]Who was it?
[305:29.70]Oh, he's dead.
[305:30.10]No damage before you die.
[305:37.50]Who is it?
[305:39.00]New guy.
[305:46.12]I don't know what new guy does.
[305:49.97]New guy's about to die.
[306:03.45]Uh, new guy's dead.
[306:04.21]Who's last?
[306:11.86]Attack!
[306:24.58]I did it.
[306:25.28]I beat the final dragon.
[306:27.21]I didn't know that a gacha board could increase in size like that.
[306:34.99]My headache.
[306:35.49]Stop.
[306:35.95]I am... Now the time has come.
[306:41.80]The Galactic Emperor has stolen her personality.
[306:45.32]I have obtained enough GF energy from this human.
[306:48.11]You're not going to use the power that destroyed our planet again, are you?
[306:51.05]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[306:54.19]G-Red, this time, with your help, we can stop him.
[306:56.81]Give us your courage.
[306:58.49]We can never be defeated by the evil Galactic Emperor.
[307:01.66]Vito, get ready for the final battle against the Galactic Emperor.
[307:11.65]Here we go, the final battle Just kidding
[307:45.93]Here we go.
[307:50.71]Just do the orange ones.
[307:52.51]Defeat the elite unit.
[307:55.37]This is the hardest shit.
[307:57.87]We're at the end.
[307:58.37]This is the end.
[307:59.45]These are the last five missions.
[308:01.69]Get rid of the jelly?
[308:02.61]I can't get rid of the jelly now.
[308:04.93]All that matters is I have the dice dragon.
[308:06.57]What do you mean it's right there?
[308:15.60]It was the last level?
[308:26.75]It was the last level?
[308:31.25]Noooo!
[308:32.44]They figured it out!
[308:33.48]He's too slow!
[308:34.92]Just run around him!
[308:35.94]Fucking idiot.
[308:49.09]Spawn in front of me.
[308:49.79]No!
[308:51.93]That's good.
[308:55.15]Don't let them fly.
[308:55.77]Don't let them fly.
[308:56.26]Don't let them fly.
[308:56.76]Do it!
[309:08.65]The cool dragon.
[309:09.65]I know.
[309:33.96]I know, but we're almost done, don't worry
[309:47.88]Godzilla God Beam is so good.
[309:50.69]Imagine if I didn't have that.
[309:51.81]I probably would have gave up.
[309:53.25]I would have been like, guys, this is going to take too long.
[309:56.43]I'm only supposed to stream for like four or five hours at a time.
[310:01.47]Sorry, I can't do it anymore.
[310:04.00]But we got dragon, so I'm able to.
[310:05.74]What the fuck?

[310:39.25]Fuck.
[310:54.86]Who do I have?
[310:56.56]Oh.
[311:07.04]This is the dumbest character in the whole game.
[311:08.76]Why is it even on here?
[311:15.04]But I want the character that, you know, the thing that I was going to say.
[311:18.42]I'll say it after the end of the stream.
[311:31.27]I'm not going to say it.
[311:32.47]It's a literal bull.
[311:35.97]I can't.
[311:54.80]How come I can stay to the end?
[311:55.74]Because everyone's going to leave.
[311:59.80]Did I make it?

[314:38.48]Are you sure?
[314:39.66]The Earth is flat.
[314:41.84]Puny human.
[314:43.63]Judgment time has arrived.

[314:52.25]Let's go.
[315:11.82]Oh no, Ice Dragon sucks.
[315:15.38]He's not good here.
[315:16.37]Should I fly?
[315:28.93]I'm seeing... It's him saying those things.
[315:32.84]His mouth is opening.
[315:34.16]Ouch!
[315:35.46]Ouchie!

[316:29.85]I hit it.
[316:30.57]I hit it.
[316:30.87]I hit it.
[316:31.13]I did it.
[316:31.37]I did it.
[316:31.68]Alright.
[316:36.86]Just stay right here and kill him.
[316:53.09]DPS phase.

[317:24.59]Mana, mana heal, I need heals.
[317:27.82]Where are you?
[317:36.80]How do I get up there?
[317:43.13]Can I go in like a teleporter?
[317:44.51]Do I have to go in?
[317:47.18]How do I get up there?
[317:55.16]Let me in.
[317:58.13]Oh, shit.
[318:00.07]Let's go, Woody.
[318:02.17]Why, Woody?

[318:42.07]Oh, fuck.

[318:55.64]Um.
[318:56.28]I don't.
[318:59.18]No.
[318:59.60]No.
[319:02.70]Get in there.
[319:11.74]Get in there.
[319:31.12]Don't throw it.
[319:34.82]Throw it.
[319:36.72]This guy's not very good at this point.
[319:38.61]Because he has all this stupid bullshit.
[319:44.85]Who's the final character I have?
[319:45.87]I don't know.
[319:55.34]It's normal ninja.
[319:57.66]No, it's not.
[319:58.12]It's tanked.
[320:09.71]Dude, what the fuck?
[320:15.17]Can I have power?
[320:25.25]Alright, this is dumb.
[320:26.65]This is dumb.
[320:33.75]Get in real close.
[320:45.78]Come on, normal ninja, get in there.
[320:59.70]No!
[321:05.03]Okay, here's something that I learned.
[321:24.38]Where are they?
[321:36.74]I only have one Ice Dragon.
[321:37.92]I need just one shitty person.
[321:45.37]Wait, you can fly around and stuff.
[321:46.97]Wait.
[322:06.76]Dragons, let's go.
[322:24.33]I know what I need to do.
[322:27.45]Only beam.
[322:29.87]Take out the eyes and just
[322:36.48]Oh, then go home!
[322:42.14]Here we go.
[322:49.20]This is it.
[322:52.48]Is it working?
[323:01.67]It's not?
[323:04.37]Are you sure?
[323:13.52]Just go up there and teleport.
[323:14.69]But he'll get hit by all the bullshit.
[323:18.39]Get in there!
[323:23.41]Let me in!
[323:25.40]Let me in!
[323:27.48]Port me up!
[323:30.80]Okay, muahahaha.
[323:34.07]That's why I didn't want to go up here.
[323:48.89]They broke his neck.
[323:51.31]I have to stay down here.
[323:52.53]No, get on the ground.
[323:55.61]Am I on the ground?
[323:59.42]I had a good spot last time.
[324:00.62]Alright, here we go.
[324:01.00]I'm on the ground.
[324:05.32]This is it.
[324:20.73]Come on, do it again.
[324:27.80]And shoot these fucking things.
[324:31.84]Where is it?
[324:37.66]I need help down here.
[324:39.08]You guys are dumb.
[324:50.09]Beam.
[324:52.31]This shit's gonna work out.
[324:54.13]I don't know why you're flying right now.
[324:55.45]What fucking kind of a moron.
[324:56.80]This is gonna work.
[325:05.18]I'm gonna get another one of those super beams.
[325:06.56]Here we go.
[325:14.73]Oh, you can't see my health!
[325:22.88]You haven't been able to see my health for the last, like, four hours.
[325:34.69]Hit it!
[325:36.83]Am I not hitting it?
[325:54.24]left idiot let me move left this shit goes through walls I I can't even move left you understand like there's and I just moved left and now they're all attacking me I just made it apparently easier for them to hit me come on again come on again give me the beam come on
[326:55.41]Drop this fucking shield!
[327:01.79]Oh yeah!
[327:05.24]I can get it on you!
[327:24.11]It's a smooth brain?
[327:27.29]What the fuck?
[327:30.54]What are you talking about?
[327:33.08]Oh my god, I'm gonna die How am I still alive?
[327:44.66]How have I not been killed?
[327:47.28]It's a matter of seconds before I die.
[327:51.66]It's only a matter of seconds.
[327:53.02]Ohhhh.
[327:55.15]It's two dragons.
[327:56.27]Two dragons and then... I don't know.
[327:58.05]Woody?
[328:08.86]Just throw all... No.
[328:10.36]It's gotta be two dragons.
[328:11.70]And don't fucking move!
[328:15.22]Get rid of the normal ninjas and then 320.
[328:17.80]Put in the blue ninja.
[328:46.27]Gatling gun is OP.
[328:47.20]Ah, but we lose.
[328:51.22]But we lose the dragon.
[328:57.36]Where's fire dragon?
[328:58.62]He's a thousand!
[328:59.24]He's a thousand!
[328:59.78]He's a thousand!
[329:13.40]Just put the ninjas between the dragons to build meter.
[329:22.77]That's a smart idea.
[329:23.57]I don't know why I didn't do it.
[329:49.81]Alright, here we go.
[329:50.39]I gotta move.
[329:50.95]Just back up.
[329:55.39]Get the eyes.
[330:00.62]Oh, cutie human!
[330:07.32]That's good.
[330:08.20]Alright, back it up.
[330:10.52]Okay, now just stand here.
[330:14.61]And land.
[330:15.77]This is it.
[330:18.97]This was calculated.
[330:19.79]Shit.
[330:40.57]This is not, it's apparently not a good spot.
[330:44.15]It's not hitting it.
[330:44.99]There we go.
[330:45.45]Right in the corner.
[330:59.28]Okay, we're alright.
[331:09.74]Again.
[331:17.40]Again.
[331:17.84]Again, again, again.
[331:19.32]It's in the perfect spot.
[331:24.40]He's fucking dead right now.
[331:27.36]He's dead.
[331:27.86]Okay, don't panic.
[331:29.60]I have plenty of time.
[331:32.32]What just happened to him?
[331:33.62]Okay, we're good?
[331:35.40]Build meter.
[331:36.22]Get up there.
[331:38.32]And just hold the button down.
[331:39.28]You motherfucker.
[331:50.53]You motherfucker!
[331:56.04]Okay, come on, dragon.
[331:59.82]No, you gotta move, man.
[332:00.88]Okay, right there, don't move.
[332:07.17]This is good, right?
[332:08.37]Is this in the right spot?
[332:12.89]Okay, I got 270.
[332:16.65]What?
[332:17.19]Where am I?
[332:19.91]No, it's in the wrong spot.
[332:26.09]Beef Corps?
[332:29.17]Oh, come on.
[332:37.27]Okay, turns out the Gatling Gunner.
[332:39.49]No, I can't even go up there.
[332:46.18]I can't even go up there with that guy.
[332:50.34]I brought the Gatling Gunner up and he just bounced around a hundred times.
[332:53.06]No, get out of here.
[332:53.84]We're doing normal ninjas only.
[332:56.10]In the middle.
[333:00.31]I can't do three dragons.
[333:01.35]It's too much.
[333:04.21]I didn't even choke.
[333:04.95]The flame dragon got fucking juggled around.
[333:08.07]I can't prevent that.
[333:09.55]I had a good spot.
[333:33.03]Flame Dragon just fucking blew it.
[333:51.66]Stupid asshole.
[333:53.30]He got knocked around and then out of place.
[333:55.04]Ah, shit.
[333:57.20]Let's go.
[333:57.62]Hurry up.
[334:08.09]I had it too.
[334:16.48]Fucking bullshit.
[334:18.02]What the hell even happened there?
[334:21.05]Alright, I'm not in a good spot.
[334:25.51]I gotta move.
[334:31.62]This is it.
[334:32.16]This is the spot.
[334:32.82]It's right there.
[334:33.72]Don't land, you fucking idiot.
[334:37.36]Turn.
[334:38.60]Go.
[334:39.46]Turn.
[334:39.90]What are you doing?
[334:52.44]Don't step forward.
[334:53.62]I didn't tell you to do that.
[335:08.67]I need the Power Blast!
[335:19.46]Alright, break it!
[335:32.97]Just kill him!
[335:33.55]Don't even do another phase!
[335:35.45]Just kill it!
[335:38.27]Oh, you mother fucker.
[335:41.87]Oh, he's so close.
[335:44.33]Who's next?
[335:44.73]I thought maybe crashing into him would help.
[336:00.10]I don't know why.
[336:09.13]Okay.
[336:09.77]Wait.
[336:10.43]I have a better idea.
[336:13.51]No, that's a terrible idea.
[336:14.69]Just kill it.
[336:15.87]Aim at it.
[336:28.36]Get me in.
[336:34.22]That's all I want.
[336:35.82]Now it's broken.
[336:36.60]Beef core.
[336:37.26]Whatever.
[336:37.56]Kill this.
[336:38.73]Okay, here we go.
[336:54.22]It's not that kickball where you put your head down and spin until... Just stop.
[337:03.87]It's not even in the right spot.
[337:05.07]I have the power.
[337:11.12]Okay, stop right here!
[337:13.47]Land the fucking ship!
[337:15.87]Activate it!
[337:16.49]Stop turning!
[337:18.05]Turn the other way!
[337:18.59]Turn this way!
[337:23.79]Eat shit, I win!
[337:27.65]You guys didn't play kickball where you put the bat down and you spin around a bunch of times and you're wicked dizzy?
[337:31.63]I win.
[337:41.94]We did it.
[337:46.06]Oh, we got an animated end.
[337:57.44]Oh, you just made me choke on my water.
[338:02.06]The bat in kickball.
[338:05.19]No.
[338:06.81]You didn't need...
[338:16.60]Goodbye.
[338:18.35]Oh, that's how big they were?
[338:19.33]I thought they were like 100 feet tall.
[338:37.86]Holy shit.

[339:23.46]Ooh.
[339:24.18]That's not good.
[339:25.90]Apologize to mana.
[339:28.47]Just because they were on the team doesn't mean they did anything.
[339:32.89]You should know from doing group projects.

[341:05.46]Come on.
[341:11.97]Oh yeah, we'll figure it out in pre-stream chat.
[341:13.49]We'll figure it out.
[341:17.83]But we'll do the bits.
[341:19.37]We'll see you tomorrow.
[341:19.83]We'll see you tomorrow.
[341:23.39]Let me just get this other screen here.
[341:26.73]Move this over.
[341:29.00]It was a lot of fun.
[341:30.14]I'm glad I got to experience that on stream.
[341:33.24]Tell us the thing.
[341:33.80]I will at the very end.
[341:39.05]At the very end.
[341:39.73]But for now, we have $15 from Shadow Teddy.
[341:43.05]Thank you.
[341:45.97]Check the comedy chart.
[341:47.07]Oh, yeah.
[341:47.37]Let's see where we go.
[341:55.72]Quick.
[341:58.10]It looks, let's see.
[341:59.82]Not bad.
[342:10.00]Not bad.
[342:14.32]Just that little part in the middle, that's all.
[342:22.12]I was on YouTube for a long time and I'm about to be on Twitch for the same amount of time that I was on YouTube.
[342:26.16]If you could believe that.
[342:28.24]They're about to be tied.
[342:48.89]I was on YouTube for about five to six years, and now we're on Twitch for about five years.
[342:52.61]So we're coming up there.
[342:56.98]Peaceful Hayley, thanks for the $2.50.
[342:58.04]I've been doubting myself again whether I should be streaming or not.
[343:02.90]Everyone always compliments me on it, and the like is super nice, but I get that one person who puts doubt in my mind whether I should be doing it or not.
[343:10.61]It's what I want to do, but I'm a girl, so I feel like I can't make it on Twitch, and I'm terrified.
[343:15.53]The compliments I do get feel like I don't deserve it.
[343:18.74]I guess it's really a me issue.
[343:20.06]Well, I'll tell you right now, it sounds like you're second-guessing yourself a little too much.
[343:24.81]Streaming should be something that you want to do.
[343:26.87]Something that you really feel like doing.
[343:31.41]And... I'm sure we make jokes on this channel about like, Oh, what do you want me to do?
[343:35.57]Look at me!
[343:36.67]Oh, chat's bullying me!
[343:37.63]I'm going to bully you!
[343:38.23]You're bullying me!
[343:38.81]What game?
[343:40.45]But at the end of the day, you need to...
[343:45.46]Gotta be in control of you and be comfortable with what you're doing.
[343:51.14]Streaming should be something that you, every time you turn it on, you're like, this is what I want to do.
[343:55.12]And there will be people that are going to say negative shit.
[343:58.85]Unfortunately, this is the nature of the internet.
[344:02.07]It's the nature of kind of where we are.
[344:03.49]It's unfortunate, but it's true.
[344:09.67]and you either take some of the maybe more harsher criticisms or some of the negative comments of people that say things and you either just ignore them or you know you it's hard to not be like oh you shut up what are you fucking dumb but just make sure it's something you want to do make sure something you really feel like doing
[344:40.59]Because if it's not, then you'll know.
[344:48.98]Make the criticism feel you to do it more.
[344:51.48]To do more and work harder.
[344:56.94]Yeah, but at the same time, some people just kind of come in and just say shit just because they're just being crazy.
[345:03.17]And some of the criticisms or some of the kind of attacking is just because they feel like doing it.
[345:07.79]It's not like, oh, hey, here's how I think you could improve your stream.
[345:14.96]But I wish you luck.
[345:16.82]Make sure you want to do it, though.
[345:18.30]That's the most important thing.
[345:22.78]Goiki, thanks for the $5.
[345:25.08]Remember, chat has ruined me.
[345:26.14]I started saying ResidentSleeper in casual conversation or in texts when things were boring and had to explain it to my mom what it meant.
[345:34.49]Then last night she sent me that she used it in a post on her political blog where she talked about how much she hates Joe Biden.
[345:42.27]Please help.
[345:44.63]Oh, boy.
[345:49.77]Oh, man.
[345:53.93]I got nothing to say about that one.
[345:55.23]That's... That's a... Mom is now using your lingo, and now you're going to have to figure out another words.
[346:05.77]Because once your parents start doing it, you can't do it anymore.
[346:07.85]You've got a ResidentSleeper.
[346:08.85]Now you've got to come up with a new one.
[346:13.41]It's over.
[346:18.39]ResidentSleeper well help me figure that out she'll probably just get over after a while she might be like I don't understand this I'm gonna go back to saying tired maybe not maybe she's here now
[346:39.11]Major Mooseman, thanks for the $2.50.
[346:40.77]First don't know, long time fan.
[346:42.29]I've been only watching regularly since Sekiro.
[346:45.05]Streams have really been helping me through college.
[346:47.36]Anyway, I know you said that if you didn't play it in November, you wouldn't stream it.
[346:51.10]But I was wondering if you ever play Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.
[346:53.42]It's not perfect, but it's combat is like... I'm going to stop you here.
[346:57.04]I played it for about 45 minutes off stream, and I did not like it.
[347:02.12]I was not a fan.
[347:04.83]first hour of that game or hour and a half was was climbing metal boxes and then sliding down and then I got killed like 15 times by that weird like pig dog thing I was like I don't want to play this
[347:44.37]I love Star Wars.
[347:49.49]You got... Mount Fiji.
[347:55.28]You rage quit the tutorial?
[347:56.60]No, I got out of the tutorial and I got to that first area where you have to like track down the Jedi's smell.
[348:05.28]And I stumbled into this cave and there was like a boss in the cave.
[348:08.24]And I was like, oh cool, the first boss.
[348:09.46]And I died like probably 10 times.
[348:10.92]And I was like, I don't even like this game.
[348:13.78]That's what happened.
[348:14.30]I'm just telling, I'm giving you the truth.
[348:15.30]I'm just telling you what happened.
[348:24.51]It went from 15 to 10.
[348:26.13]So that means it was 20.
[348:27.93]If you're paying attention.
[348:31.16]I love Star Wars I just wasn't a bit I yeah I just wouldn't didn't grab me drummage door thanks for the 250 yo funny man guy bro dude mate friend I watched your rhythm heaven heaven heaven hold on itchy I watched hey let's try that over hold on itching my eye
[348:49.99]I watch your rhythm heaven fever stream.
[348:51.73]That's kind of a hard string of things to say.
[348:54.87]I maybe realize you'd most likely really enjoy a fantastic game called Thumper.
[349:00.11]Some have classified it as a psychedelic horror rhythm game.
[349:03.17]I've actually... I don't think I can play this.
[349:06.79]I remember looking at this before.
[349:08.71]This game really hurts my eyes.
[349:12.60]Something about like that moving with the neon colors and... It kind of hurts my head.
[349:27.23]Yeah, my brain melts, unfortunately.
[349:30.07]It looks fun, but I know I wouldn't be able to... I'd be like, I'd have to fucking stop after like 30 minutes.
[349:39.92]But no, it does look fun.
[349:44.82]One less game to get in the way of Jeru Crew.
[349:49.20]Red Walrus, thanks for $5.
[349:50.76]Jerm, a long time watcher.
[349:51.78]You really helped me when I was just down in the dumps a while ago.
[349:53.94]Just wanted you to know that.
[349:55.99]But also, I'm wondering if you're going to play Armored Core.
[349:59.19]I don't know.
[349:59.65]Here's the problem I have with Armored Core.
[350:04.83]Aren't there like 12 of them?
[350:10.59]Do you have to, I mean, which ones do you play?
[350:12.94]Does it matter?
[350:18.46]There's a lot of them.
[350:19.82]Just... There's only four.
[350:24.36]There's 15 games.
[350:25.50]Play them all.
[350:27.00]Or just play four.
[350:30.68]Okay, which one... If you guys can give me reliably the one or two that... Or the one that is the best one.
[350:38.71]Like, the one that you should play.
[350:43.21]Then I'll probably give it a try.
[350:45.35]Four is the one.
[350:46.07]It's four.
[350:46.65]Okay.
[350:46.77]Okay.
[350:52.12]Uh, maybe.
[350:53.98]They'll say, also, Warhammer 40k Space Marine, too, because I want you to suffer with the rest of us.
[350:59.28]Too bad THQ died.
[351:00.69]Thanks for reading.
[351:01.65]You're a goblin.
[351:04.97]I know.
[351:07.10]Hey Jason, thanks for the 250.
[351:08.42]Jerma, I'd like to thank you for letting me borrow your Lamborghini and letting me stay in your penthouse for free during the pandemic.
[351:14.48]Since you're a multi-millionaire, I guess I could help you out too.
[351:17.01]Enjoy the 250 on me, bro.
[351:19.91]You're welcome.
[351:21.43]Silent Serenity, thanks for the 250.
[351:22.87]Jerma, now that you're running for public office, we're requesting that you release your tax returns.
[351:26.89]We've caught this one already.
[351:32.28]I do my taxes and I pay my taxes.
[351:36.82]Okay.
[351:37.62]I got a guy.
[351:38.82]I got a CPA.
[351:39.62]I'm not running for fucking office.
[351:46.30]Do you understand how badly I would lose?
[351:53.69]There's so much here.
[351:55.15]The only political ad they need to do was... I mean, you got me saying... You're from the mayor of Vegas.
[352:08.91]I forgot.
[352:10.11]I'm like, oh, look at all the horrible things I've said.
[352:12.99]You go back and like, oh, piss in my face.
[352:14.73]I'm like, oh, I'm going to shit in my toilet and eat it or whatever.
[352:17.17]I don't think that matters anymore.
[352:20.00]They would love it.
[352:34.78]That's why they would vote for you.
[352:43.18]Uh... Interesting thought project.
[352:46.80]It's a really good callback.
[352:47.40]Thanks for the $2.50.
[353:11.54]1-1-1-2-E, thanks for three dollars.
[353:14.07]Number 15, Burger King foot lettuce.
[353:16.65]Last thing, this is a coffee pasta.
[353:18.75]I remember it was spammed for a while.
[353:25.51]Thanks for the three dollars.
[353:28.11]Man with baby hands, thanks for five dollars.
[353:31.55]I was expecting shpee, but what I got was this funny sounding guy calling himself Jerma pretending to be shpee.
[353:37.76]+2.
[353:39.62]Thanks for the five dollars.
[353:43.19]Oh yeah, I did say it like 10 times.
[353:46.86]Silent Serenity, thanks for 250.
[353:48.02]I'm a software engineer for a living.
[353:50.18]I'd love to work with you to make a Jerma coin a reality.
[353:52.36]Let me know if you want to discuss.
[353:53.48]Absolutely not.
[353:55.32]Absolutely not.
[353:56.22]No.
[353:57.12]In 800 million years, no.
[353:58.34]Zero.
[353:58.76]Absolute zero.
[353:59.46]No interest at all.
[354:00.66]Zero.
[354:01.88]No.
[354:04.72]No.
[354:05.14]No.
[354:05.86]Absolutely not.
[354:06.42]No.
[354:07.24]Okay, I think we're clear.
[354:08.06]Good.
[354:08.90]Thanks for the offer, though.
[354:12.83]Thank you.
[354:13.41]I try way too hard.
[354:17.73]For the $15.
[354:18.29]That's the 1500 bits.
[354:22.60]Remember, you should contact Orb.
[354:26.68]Look into his orbit system he has for the comedy economy.
[354:30.24]He is actually how I found out about you back when he visited PAX East one year.
[354:34.78]Love the streams.
[354:35.37]Keep it up.
[354:36.11]He's a great dude.
[354:38.79]He actually came to Vegas last year.
[354:41.85]It's great to see him.
[354:44.50]We don't, like, play games at all, and we don't really do anything with each other anymore.
[354:47.78]But we, like, when he's around, we hang out.
[354:50.75]It was great to see him last year.
[354:53.71]I haven't heard that name in a while.
[355:04.74]You're bragging about it.
[355:05.80]Yeah, I am.
[355:07.28]I like him.
[355:07.62]He's cool.
[355:11.32]Yeah, maybe I'll hit him up and see how he does it.
[355:16.23]Thanks for the tip, though.
[355:18.35]And also, we had two more $15, 1500 bits back-to-back.
[355:24.29]One from Abomination Zero and one from Big Mama.
[355:27.95]Big Mama says, I will pay you so I don't have to hear more stock jokes.
[355:31.53]Please, my children are crying.
[355:33.31]You're going to have to hear them for a little while longer, especially if I end up doing this thing, which might not happen.
[355:43.80]uh we also have here is an image it's a t-shirt design from abomination zero thanks again for the 15 and here's the t-shirt I don't know if here's the thing about like this could be on a website right now and I have no idea I don't know if you're making a joke or if like if you found this I'm not sure if this is something you made or if somebody did it already
[356:14.24]But, there it is.
[356:21.03]Jesus.
[356:21.39]Is this a normal problem to have?
[356:22.75]Please help.
[356:23.07]Where are you gonna put those?
[356:25.21]Where are you gonna put 200 mozzarella sticks?
[356:43.73]That's a lot.
[356:44.19]That's too many.
[356:46.27]But those things are great.
[356:49.19]I actually love those things.
[356:50.55]So you're not going to get any kickback here from me.
[356:57.74]Thanks for the $5.
[356:59.60]Blueberry Juice, thanks for $2.50.
[357:01.88]Thanks again for banning me yesterday.
[357:03.12]It let me get all my work done.
[357:04.66]However, there's a new problem that I need your advice for.
[357:07.38]See, I was doing some yard work where I had to spread this 10 bag all over my lawn.
[357:14.07]And then they say, sorry, I fucked up.
[357:15.31]I sent that last one way too soon.
[357:16.60]It was another $2.50.
[357:17.22]I fucked up so bad.
[357:18.90]I'm kind of emotional because of this.
[357:23.36]But yeah, I was doing some yard work and after laying down that giant bag of soil, I wanted to seed it with clover.
[357:28.13]It wasn't bad.
[357:28.75]It was a good workout and I got it done in about six hours.
[357:31.83]Now I have a real problem.
[357:33.43]These little birds keep coming by and eating all of it.
[357:35.47]This is one out of three.
[357:40.47]Hold on.
[357:42.05]Jeb guys gave $3.
[357:43.35]Jeremiah, I'm starting my chem PhD at Brandeis next fall.
[357:48.90]Any good food places in Boston I should visit?
[357:51.32]Thanks for being the best streamer, buddy.
[357:53.94]You know, I've been so far out of the game for Boston restaurants.
[358:00.27]I couldn't even really tell you.
[358:01.73]It's been like three years since I've eaten any of them.
[358:07.19]Trying to think of... Some of them might not even...
[358:10.65]um like three or four years ago this is probably the last I you know what I don't think three years since you've eaten in Boston uh the burger places are good yeah like Boston burger company's awesome somebody already said it Boston burger company is fantastic um if you don't like hamburgers he's a fake bostonian
[358:37.84]Yeah, go to the north.
[358:38.92]Okay, here you go.
[358:40.34]Go to the north end.
[358:42.02]Uh, spin around in a circle and then walk in a direction to any of the restaurants.
[358:47.98]Because they're all good.
[358:50.42]What's that pizza place called?
[358:51.54]It was fucking fantastic.
[358:55.96]Uh... Oh my god, it's like the most famous fucking... It's like the best... It's like the most famous Boston pizza place.
[359:03.76]What's wrong with me?
[359:09.44]Regina.
[359:10.30]Pizzeria Regina.
[359:11.34]Regina Pizzeria.
[359:17.06]It's incredible.
[359:25.69]Hasta Italiano.
[359:33.27]Yeah, I would say, yeah, those.
[359:35.08]But go to the North End.
[359:36.52]Some of those restaurants, they're insane.
[359:38.98]I don't remember very much any specifics, but I've had some of the best seafood I've ever had in my whole life from the North End.
[359:45.12]I wish you luck.
[359:49.51]It's a great city.
[359:50.59]Have fun.
[359:54.94]Alright, goo berry juice.
[359:56.02]We're talking about your soil that you plant.
[359:57.63]You got a real problem.
[359:58.97]Got some bird.
[359:59.69]Okay, I've tried everything to scare off these birds, but they're just too smart.
[360:04.21]I hung up tinfoil strips and some cans to make some noise, but they don't give a shit.
[360:09.60]I've set the sprinklers to go on, but they just wait until they turn off and they go back to eating.
[360:14.84]I made a scarecrow.
[360:18.92]This is your scarecrow?
[360:25.99]This scarecrow isn't going to do anything.
[360:34.96]How would this scarecrow... Ooh, that's macro.
[360:52.83]Um... Why would that work?
[360:56.61]I bought- I broke down and made a scarecrow, okay?
[360:59.57]I think they even ended up liking the scarecrow.
[361:02.29]I'm being jebaited by birds.
[361:03.79]I can't live like this anymore.
[361:04.95]Please, if there's any advice you can give me to help my bird plight, I would be eternally grateful.
[361:09.14]By the way, that wasn't my sweater.
[361:11.04]I have a sex life all the time.
[361:13.24]That's good to know.
[361:15.04]Um, okay, I'm gonna- I'm gonna solve your problem right now.
[361:18.75]You ready?
[361:19.79]Buy a bird feeder.
[361:21.37]Fill it with bird seed.
[361:23.78]And move it 10 feet away from where you want them to avoid.
[361:27.52]That just solves your problem.
[361:38.92]Get birdseed.
[361:39.86]Get like the most delicious birdseed that you know.
[361:42.42]Find out what kind of birds they are.
[361:43.99]Find out their eating habits and what they like.
[361:47.23]and then if you like if you have a bird problem over here with the soil and no no no no no their favorite restaurant is 10 feet away why are you guys saying no don't do not do that are you saying bribe the birds I'm saying create a bird restaurant that they go to that you could just fill with like four dollar bag of bird seed that they like once like every three weeks
[362:24.45]And then they'll hang out and you'll have like some music while you're out working in the yard.
[362:29.77]And you get to enjoy the cool birds over at the bird restaurant.
[362:34.53]But then you're probably going to get another problem.
[362:36.05]Squirrels love that shit.
[362:37.79]So then you'll end up having a squirrel problem.
[362:40.61]And then I can't help you after that.
[362:43.10]I only solve one problem at a time.
[362:44.52]Uh.
[362:49.59]Don't take any advice from me, ever.
[362:51.45]Everything I say is made up.
[362:52.85]Thanks for the, uh... Thanks for, like, the fuckin' $15.

[363:23.78]What are you talking about?
[363:27.98]What's so wrong with playing the Mighty Mighty Boss Stones?
[363:30.19]They have, like, positive messages in their songs.

[363:36.29]That's when their CD came out.

[367:48.56]I, 3D Movie Maker, I can't, how am I, what am I gonna, who am I, what do I call?
[367:57.65]Uh, my $112,000 net worth, according to fucking Twitch statistics, whatever, I don't think it's gonna cover even the legal fees to go to the civil court to be able to transfer those files to me.
[368:10.66]You understand, guys?
[368:19.91]Maka Ash Bill Gates That's cool though, that's really cool Yeah, that's cool Smarky MC gave $50 and I didn't see it Thank You Smarky 5000 bits 50 fucking dollars and I didn't see it.
[368:43.49]How did I not see this?
[368:46.17]Can you please read the entire wall of lore when you play Neverhood?
[368:48.92]I probably will.
[368:49.50]At least most of it.
[368:50.80]Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[368:58.30]I really appreciate it.
[369:03.29]I'm probably not going to do that.
[369:04.17]Thanks for the gigantic bit drop.
[369:09.61]Smarky MC.
[369:12.20]Freak out.
[369:12.68]Thanks for the $5.
[369:13.10]Freak out.
[369:14.64]I don't read your messages anymore, but I will give you this.
[369:19.95]I have to put my phone down.
[369:23.43]They sing the Curious George theme song in their bits, but I've said I'm not going to read their messages anymore.
[369:29.96]I have to stand by that.
[369:46.58]Play the song?
[369:47.56]No, they sing the song in text.
[369:54.03]That's so sad.
[369:54.67]What the fuck happened to you?
[369:56.19]What?
[369:56.45]I have to put my foot down.
[369:57.85]You know how many fucked up messages I've received?
[370:15.49]He's changed.
[370:25.44]Would you call his message fucked up now?
[370:27.46]No.
[370:31.00]But you can't- you can't burn the barn down.
[370:33.68]And when the police show up, you start singing the Curious George soundtrack and think that you're not gonna get arrested.
[371:01.15]Oh shit, he's gonna start locking people up.
[371:08.32]Thanks for the five dollars, though.
[371:09.66]God, alright.
[371:13.50]DarkSoul, thanks for the $2.58.
[371:14.94]Jerma, just want to thank you for introducing chat to my favorite genre, cringecore.
[371:18.73]The streams have been great while I work on my ascension to godhood with a custom full-body VRChat avatar.
[371:24.35]Also, I'm shutting down the Drew crew.
[371:26.19]PodSquad is now on the job until you play Skyrim VR.
[371:37.11]Hey, Dinosaurus Rex, thanks for 250.
[371:38.73]Check out Neil Cicerega.
[371:41.93]Have fun pronouncing that.
[371:42.85]I did.
[371:44.20]He makes mashup albums.
[371:45.62]My favorite album is Mouth Moods, and my absolute favorite track of his is mashup album of this track.
[371:52.94]Let's take a quick little listen.
[372:00.80]I'll give it 15 seconds.
[372:07.23]We'll give it 15 seconds, let's see.
[372:09.24]Here we go.
[372:38.84]Good.
[372:39.60]Very good.
[372:45.34]Wait, if you do a double copyright, does one copyright like kill the other copyright?
[372:49.49]How does that work?
[372:51.13]Does one supersede the other?
[372:52.23]Do they copyright fight each other?
[372:54.66]How does it work?
[373:13.17]What the hell?
[373:27.87]That was really cool.
[373:30.80]I'm gonna have to listen to more of these later when I'm in the bath.
[373:39.13]Oh, I'll tell you a quick little story about the bath.
[373:41.09]I took a bath last night, and, um, I have this device that I put my iPad in, and it hooks into the iPad, and it's this big, stretchy, solid, it's like a big wire that I can fold and move around, and the iPad can stand up, you can bend it, you can put it around your arm, you can put it on the edge of a bed, and it's pretty cool.
[374:05.84]It's actually a really cool device.
[374:08.33]Um,
[374:09.98]yesterday I was filling the bathtub and I was setting this thing up and it was like getting it ready and I turned the water on and the iPad shook a little bit because it was like I had it standing up on the edge and it fell into the water by the way the water wouldn't even like really turned on it was like just barely like not even a tenth of a centimeter of water on the ground
[374:37.29]And it, like, went into the water, and, like, I grabbed it immediately, and then I was fine, and I wiped it off quickly with the towel, and it was fine.
[374:44.73]I mean, no, the water was, like, on, but it wasn't, like, the whole bat, it was just hitting the surface, it was hitting the bottom, you know what I mean?
[374:50.36]It was a good story.
[374:57.95]He just dropped his iPad in the bathtub and he added the water part to make you think that, well, that could have been crazy, but there was no water in that tub.
[375:08.10]He's a liar.
[375:11.26]No, there was water in that tub.
[375:17.36]Not very much.
[375:22.39]Were you naked when it happened?
[375:23.53]Yes.
[375:23.85]Yes.
[375:31.36]What were you going to tell us at the end of the stream, you phony fucking piece of shit?
[375:34.88]Hey, relax.
[375:35.90]It was a thought project.
[375:41.52]I actually did drop the fucking in the bathtub.
[375:43.89]It was bad.
[375:47.25]What was I going to say at the very... Okay, hey, listen.
[375:50.03]So that jelly character... Okay, I'm going to... No, no, no, no.
[375:52.51]It has to be at the very end because I want everyone to be able to leave and not have to listen to it.
[375:54.97]Let's do the credits.
[375:56.68]Let's do the credits.
[376:00.54]Fucking lying about putting, like, drop and shit in his bathtub.
[376:04.32]Really, dude?
[376:07.20]Oh, I turned the water on.
[376:08.02]The water wasn't on, but I turned it off.
[376:09.24]And, like, I dried this thing, and I put it on the side, but it fell.
[376:11.39]But the water wasn't on, but the water was on.
[376:13.51]Fucking piece of shit.
[376:14.75]Got him.
[376:15.47]We got him.
[376:16.29]We got him now, guys.
[376:18.15]We got him now.
[376:23.29]If you forget, I'm leaving.
[376:24.33]Well, you're gonna leave anyways, because the stream's gonna be over.
[376:34.58]Five community subs from Chibi Fumako.
[376:39.86]Thanks for the five subs.
[376:42.80]That's right at the very end.
[376:45.54]Alright, let's get the credits rolling.
[376:47.86]All the subs today.
[376:50.68]Thank you once again, all of you.
[376:59.23]Here they come.
[377:01.29]There they are.
[377:04.79]subs thanks everybody for your subscriptions thanks for subbing the channel thanks for sticking around thanks for watching thanks for being around thanks for being here you I'm talking to you you you in the back back there you in the back you've been talking through the whole stream
[377:29.09]You know, there's a part in... Bill Murray did this movie called Scrooged.
[377:36.13]And it's about... Bill Murray becomes Ebenezer Scrooge.
[377:41.04]It's kind of a weird movie.
[377:41.88]It's a good movie, though.
[377:43.40]At the very end of the movie...
[377:45.58]He's thanking everybody for watching.
[377:47.42]He's like, hey, thanks.
[377:52.82]Thanks all the men there.
[377:54.26]All the women.
[377:54.76]Thank you, all the women.
[377:56.33]Thank you.
[377:57.01]Thank the dog.
[377:58.55]And you, the person that's been talking the whole movie.
[378:01.55]And he points right at the screen.
[378:04.87]And I was watching the movie with my cousin at the time.
[378:07.43]And the cousin freaked out.
[378:09.07]We were like 12, like 10, whatever.
[378:12.11]And she was like, what?
[378:12.99]Me?
[378:13.65]Oh, like, he's talking to me.
[378:14.87]And I'm like, holy shit, he's talking to you.
[378:17.09]You were talking this whole movie.
[378:18.81]What the hell?
[378:19.23]How did you know?
[378:19.99]Hopefully I just did that to somebody else.
[378:34.35]There's another made-up story.
[378:39.89]No.
[378:40.33]What a dumb thing to make up.
[378:42.53]All these things I say.
[378:44.31]But I just fucking... You have no idea what could be real.
[378:49.43]I'm such a master of illusions.
[378:52.08]You have no idea.
[378:55.30]I might not even be fucking 34 years old.
[378:57.20]I might be fucking 40.
[378:58.32]I might be 20.
[378:59.12]You have no idea how old I am.
[379:01.32]Yes, you do.
[379:09.60]That was funny.
[379:10.02]It was a funny thing that happened when I was a kid.
[379:13.04]Hey, thanks for the subs, though.
[379:14.42]All of you.
[379:17.68]Brian, the last dinosaur.
[379:19.98]Thanks for the $3.
[379:20.80]Get a Logitech MX518.
[379:22.16]I think we caught that one earlier.
[379:25.54]It's a perfect mouse that will last you literally decades like my old one did.
[379:30.80]I have to tell you, Logitech's a good company, right?
[379:35.92]Logitech makes pretty good shit, don't they?
[379:38.78]From what I've seen and heard.
[379:42.00]Kind of, yeah.
[379:43.44]What about the music?
[379:44.28]I got you.
[379:50.24]I'll have to give it a look.
[379:51.04]Yeah, it's true.
[380:02.74]Oathorse, thanks for the thousand bits.
[380:04.52]Really fun stream today.
[380:06.40]I painted a Bob Ross painting while listening.
[380:09.16]The pog market is a hilarious idea.
[380:11.52]Looking forward to seeing what you do with it.
[380:13.92]I love your childlike enjoyment of gacha force nostalgia over a game that literally no one in the chat likes.
[380:19.98]I love that you don't care.
[380:22.08]Also, the music makes me want to claw all the flesh off my face.
[380:27.37]Well, I mean, there's a story there.
[380:28.85]I'm not going to get bullied twice in a row.
[380:31.95]Beautiful Joe was like, this game sucks.
[380:34.41]It's boring.
[380:34.97]Do something.
[380:35.51]I hate this.
[380:37.09]And I was like, okay, fine.
[380:39.65]It's not going to happen twice in a row.
[380:41.91]You got your veto.
[380:43.13]You vetoed Beautiful Joe.
[380:44.95]I'm going to play my $250 piece of plastic.
[380:58.06]CD made out of plastic or metal?
[381:00.62]What is a CD made out of?
[381:01.56]Aluminum?
[381:03.38]Metal?
[381:04.91]Seriously, what is a CD made out of?
[381:07.79]Is it plastic?
[381:09.51]It's like a weird compound.
[381:12.55]Tough, brittle plastic called polycarbonate.
[381:16.35]And sandwiched in the middle is aluminum.
[381:18.55]Right, okay, I had it right.
[381:20.49]Plastic and aluminum.
[381:21.22]I had it right.
[381:29.80]No, it was fun.
[381:30.76]Thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[381:34.22]Devakitty, thanks for the 250.
[381:35.48]Jerma, you won't be the first one to finish Gachiforce on Twitch.
[381:40.57]SomeSuma did it a few weeks ago.
[382:04.98]Ban this person?
[382:10.94]Is this where I go?
[382:11.64]What's, who's, summer?
[382:14.21]What's, who's, summer?
[382:15.03]And then you say summer.
[382:18.05]Is this how this joke plays out?
[382:28.00]Yeah.
[382:29.32]Right.
[382:29.90]Okay.
[382:31.99]DarkSoul, thanks for 250.
[382:33.24]Are you not able to do the Amazon Watch Together streams on here or something?
[382:37.46]I've seen other streamers able to use that and watch, like, Star Trek.
[382:41.66]We should see what's on there, and maybe we can watch something Pog instead.
[382:45.36]By the way, if you're gonna do Half-Life Alyx, you should do that before Boneworks, because Boneworks is so good, I think Alyx just sucks.
[382:53.71]Damn.
[382:53.81]That's a strong opinion.
[383:00.11]I don't know, man.
[383:03.20]um the reason why I didn't do the Amazon watch party is because it's a very limited catalog of stuff and it's only available to the united states so I was like yeah maybe if they start opening that up that might be fun to do like officially but yeah it's only united states and it's only if you have Amazon prime
[383:29.18]And I'll be honest, I'm not in the market of trying to make less people watch my stream.
[383:35.94]I don't... That's not... I'm not into... I don't want to do that.
[383:39.38]I have no interest in doing that.
[383:42.89]You have to have Amazon Prime.
[383:44.57]You have to have Twitch Prime.
[383:46.61]You have to be from the United States.
[383:48.73]Like, I just, like, carved off a significant portion of the people that watch.
[383:52.67]I'm in the market of wanting people to watch, not telling people they can't.
[383:58.00]It's kind of like an exclusive club thing that I don't really want to do.
[384:10.38]If they start expanding it, then yeah, I'll try it.
[384:12.18]But as of right now, probably not.
[384:19.66]Dr. Zero Fox, thanks for the $15.
[384:21.86]They say UWU.
[384:22.50]UWU.
[384:22.70]Thanks for the $15.
[384:31.57]A dried cleaner thanks to 300 bits.
[384:33.41]Jerm, I was wondering if you ever played Fable 2 or streamed it.
[384:35.78]One of the best games ever.
[384:37.28]I recommend it for watching your streams.
[384:38.70]I played the shit out of Fable 2.
[384:40.14]I played the shit out of Fable 1.
[384:42.32]And I got to the part in Fable 3 where you opened up chests to do things and said this game sucks and stopped playing it.
[384:50.60]It was like within the first hour and a half.
[385:00.73]But I love that franchise.
[385:02.27]I've played the hell out of the first two games.
[385:03.77]They're very fun.
[385:11.09]But probably not on stream.
[385:11.91]I've played through them multiple times.
[385:14.31]With multiple characters doing multiple builds.
[385:16.50]There's not much else I can do in Fable 1 and 2 that I have not done in a playthrough that I've done years ago.
[385:21.40]They're great, though.
[385:29.96]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[385:31.10]I don't want to be a Debbie Downer, but to be honest, I don't have anyone in my real day-to-day life to talk to.
[385:36.86]But an hour ago, me and my boyfriend split up after five years.
[385:40.67]We've known each other for longer, but God, I never thought this would happen.
[385:44.47]I need to focus on me now.
[385:45.87]I don't really know what else to say.
[385:47.09]Thanks for listening.
[385:51.33]That's a long relationship.
[385:52.25]That's a long time.
[385:54.33]But you're right.
[385:56.97]Now you do you.
[385:59.93]You take care of your life and move forward.
[386:05.41]That's really all you can do.
[386:12.84]You don't back up on the highway.
[386:18.80]Forward.
[386:28.93]Maybe you don't.
[386:33.68]Your analogies suck.
[386:36.28]What?
[386:36.64]If you're on the highway, you go forward, you don't stop, you don't go back, you move forward and you go to your exit.
[386:43.27]If you miss your exit, you don't stop, you fucking go forward and you find another way to get off the next exit and you find- figure out you fucking- where you go!
[387:01.01]You clip through the trees.
[387:08.79]No, you don't do that.
[387:13.61]You go off-road.
[387:16.86]What kind of car do you drive?
[387:20.76]But anyways.
[387:21.24]I'm going to say it again.
[387:28.01]You don't go reverse on the highway.
[387:29.89]Done.
[387:30.51]And that's exactly how you should feel.
[387:33.35]Forward.
[387:34.99]Look back.
[387:35.43]Forward.
[387:35.75]Forward.
[387:39.43]Don't clip through any trees, don't just fucking go forward.
[387:43.03]Right.
[387:44.21]Chat.
[387:46.24]Beta streamer doesn't turn around on the highway.
[387:49.02]Yeah, beta streamer doesn't die in a car wreck.
[387:52.96]Okay, that sounds good.
[387:54.12]That sounds great, actually.
[387:57.16]Good.
[387:57.80]Okay.
[388:03.69]Why are there trees on the highway?
[388:07.39]If they were just a bunch of trees in the road and you have you going like 60 plus miles per hour Holy shit, what a design oversight that would have been That's challenge mode It would be like skiing in the Olympics Those flags
[388:35.49]But anyways, Hayley.
[388:37.25]I wish you the best.
[388:37.89]That's... It's not the best thing to happen.
[388:43.79]But you'll be alright.
[388:48.13]Just keep going forward.
[388:49.59]Don't fucking go and hit the brakes on the highway.
[388:51.99]As Germa985 says.
[388:54.13]It's dogshit advice.
[388:56.51]Literally never ask Jerma for advice on anything.
[388:59.33]Because all of his advice is dogshit.
[389:13.76]Ever.
[389:14.02]No, don't.
[389:17.66]No, do that when you're getting off.
[389:20.03]Do that when you're getting off.
[389:21.61]You have to hit the brakes when you're getting off.
[389:23.09]Otherwise, you're going to be in big trouble.
[389:30.90]I wish you the best, though.
[389:32.76]Take care of yourself.
[389:33.60]Take care of you.
[389:36.13]Hey, thank you, Mick, for the $15.
[389:38.35]Jerma, it's good to see you play a game you like so much.
[389:40.77]And I'm excited for you to get back to finishing every Nancy Drew game back to back.
[389:46.47]You're going to be very disappointed.
[389:54.73]Thanks for the $15.
[389:58.15]Old70ham, thanks for $3.20.
[390:00.19]Hey, Jerma.
[390:02.53]Here's some bite-sized bits because you're epic.
[390:06.20]Oh, thanks.
[390:06.67]Do I get to eat Dunkin' Donuts?
[390:13.27]Thanks for the three bucks.
[390:18.24]Rock writing, thanks for the 300 bits.
[390:21.62]You don't have to read this if you want to wrap the stream up.
[390:23.44]No, we're good.
[390:24.68]I mean, I'm about 30 minutes over my maximum time, but we got an overheal going.
[390:30.45]It's okay.
[390:34.88]That's how it gets good.
[390:35.82]Just not like eight hour.
[390:37.00]Like, I just can't.
[390:38.26]I gotta stop doing like the fucking seven to eight plus hour streams.
[390:42.77]I can't do them anymore.
[390:46.99]Like, I physically have to stop doing those.
[390:49.93]I'm sorry, but it's reality.
[391:00.34]No more 12... No, the Lord of the Rings stream will be the longest stream I will ever do.
[391:04.78]Ever.
[391:05.13]Until this stream doesn't stream anymore.
[391:07.85]It sucks.
[391:08.45]Well, actually, I'm actually kind of happy about that.
[391:10.09]That's fine.
[391:10.79]But anyways, they say.
[391:12.49]My fiance and I watched the complete Lord of the Rings trilogy last night.
[391:16.40]Perfect timing.
[391:18.14]And I hate that now my nostalgic connection to the soundtrack has been replaced with the fever dream that was when I fell asleep to your Two Towers stream, then woke up at some unholy hour of the night to the Uruk-hai theme on a seemingly endless loop and you trying to knock down those damn orc ladders, playing as Gimli.
[391:37.41]Anyway, my best to you, Chad and Otto.
[391:42.90]You know what's really sad?
[391:44.97]Is somebody telling me that I have ruined the Lord of the Rings for them?
[391:49.65]That's heavy.
[391:53.26]That's... That's tough to hear.
[391:55.60]Holy... That's not... That's bad.
[392:01.02]Something that is so hard to ruin for somebody is that franchise.
[392:04.71]And I've done it somehow.
[392:12.99]I've never seen the films.
[392:14.09]Looked boring.
[392:14.71]They're really good.
[392:16.49]You'll like them.
[392:17.17]Just watch them.
[392:19.09]Watch them when you have, like, the amount of time.
[392:22.42]When you get, like, three weeks to yourself.
[392:24.90]Watch Lord of the Rings.
[392:29.19]Thanks for rock writing.
[392:31.09]Sorry to have ruined your favorite franchise ever.
[392:34.57]Mine too.
[392:35.61]Thanks for the three bucks.
[392:37.20]Shadows, one disciple.
[392:38.42]Thanks for the 250.
[392:39.18]Germany, your enthusiasm for Gacha Force is palpable.
[392:42.10]It's great when you love a game.
[392:43.14]Don't let chat tell you differently.
[392:45.36]I would probably enjoy this game too, but I don't have a GameCube.
[392:48.08]I played the hell out of a similar game on PlayStation 3 called Battle of Z. However, I am more concerned about something else.
[392:56.72]Where did you get your degree in gaming slash gamers licenses?
[393:01.04]I couldn't find a certificate of gaming for you in Nevada, Massachusetts, nor anywhere in New England.
[393:05.91]Are you certified?
[393:06.55]You don't have to have, you don't have to.
[393:10.63]Yeah, I am.
[393:11.13]You don't have to be certain.
[393:13.09]Yeah, I am.
[393:15.91]I look, I got my certification when I was like eight years old.
[393:21.69]This doesn't expire.
[393:26.88]I got my championship... I got my gamer championship license thing that I showed.
[393:31.22]That happened when I was a kid.
[393:33.56]They never expire.
[393:34.76]You never have to renew them.
[393:40.14]Blockbuster video game championships.
[393:41.74]Yeah, I got two free rentals a month for a year.
[393:49.89]I'm certified.
[393:50.57]I haven't been recertified in a long time.
[394:00.88]Doesn't mean I wasn't.
[394:04.56]Thanks for the $2.50, though.
[394:06.95]Wembley TTV, thanks for the $2.50.
[394:08.51]I showed a pal of mine who was a GT driver the burnout spy cam video with no context.
[394:14.73]His first reaction was looking at your license photo saying, what is that?
[394:19.29]I guess you do have that sort of effect on people.
[394:23.65]Yeah, I remember this.
[394:27.72]The terrifying...
[394:30.19]Balding head, face down, like a long face with a nose.
[394:34.63]Yeah, it's horrible.
[394:36.27]That's the second image on the internet that I hate.
[394:45.87]The eye, crazy eyes, mouth one is number one.
[394:50.50]And in the bathrobe, head pointed down, eyes up is the other one.
[395:00.51]Thanks for the $2.50.
[395:00.93]Hey Dark Soul, thanks for $2.50.
[395:04.43]If you want to play another fun robo game, you should try Gundam Breaker 3 for PlayStation 4.
[395:09.77]You have to import it or use an HK account.
[395:15.08]HK account.
[395:15.78]It's on Amazon and play Asia in an English version.
[395:18.92]It's a really good game, especially if you want to make your own cool gunplay fighter.
[395:23.20]Don't play new Gundam Breaker on PC, though.
[395:25.06]That one sucks.
[395:29.93]Okay.
[395:31.45]Alright, done.
[395:31.91]Stop making his list bigger.
[395:36.55]Don't make his list bigger.
[395:38.19]The list is never ending.
[395:43.12]It's like your Christmas list.
[395:44.28]Did you guys ever do the Christmas... Okay.
[395:46.68]I remember when I was a kid.
[395:48.36]We used to get the... There would be this catalog that came in the mail.
[395:53.64]And I don't know if it was like JCPenney or it was some big box store and they had a toy section.
[396:00.04]And I remember what I would do is I'd take this huge catalog and I would just take a Sharpie and I would circle every single thing I wanted for Christmas and give it to my parents.
[396:12.27]Say, this is what I want.
[396:14.35]Here it is.
[396:16.27]And it was like two grand worth of stuff.
[396:23.42]It's like, oh, oh, oh, this is what, this is what you think Santa's gonna bring you.
[396:28.01]Wow, okay, well, we'll see.
[396:30.53]And you end up getting, like, a quarter of a percent of the stuff on that, on the stuff you circled, and you don't even remember.
[396:39.62]Like, maybe, like, not even a tenth of those things is what you got for Christmas.
[396:48.96]And you just don't remember, oh, wow, yeah, I like this.
[396:52.18]I don't even remember circling, like, 125 items.
[397:00.70]Got to be young.
[397:02.66]More like 1 100th, yeah.
[397:06.16]Did you expect to get it all?
[397:07.42]Mine was a wish list.
[397:08.45]I don't know, my, like, seven-year-old brain thought that, hey, this is what I get.
[397:13.73]This is what I want.
[397:20.78]Yeah, it's a wish list, means I wish I had all this.
[397:25.83]Here, wish-granters, make this a reality, parents.
[397:28.61]That's how it was.
[397:37.11]He's a cringe rich kid.
[397:40.35]What?
[397:41.99]Spoiled.
[397:43.21]No, I just told you that they would be like, oh, okay, and I would get, like, I would get, like, maybe six items.
[397:53.97]I see some of your fucking Christmas tweets and Christmas things you guys get.
[397:58.93]I see some of the toys that you get.
[398:00.35]Some of you guys get like fucking sneakers.
[398:04.12]Like $300 pairs of sneakers.
[398:16.47]How does he know?
[398:17.21]I know.
[398:18.99]I used to have to walk around with loaves of bread on my feet.
[398:22.65]That's what we did.
[398:23.03]We had two loaves of bread, and we would squish on them and walk on them.
[398:28.22]How dare you guys?
[398:38.84]What a waste.
[398:40.92]Imagine a family walking around with... Like, let's say you got a family of five.
[398:48.66]That's ten loaves of bread.
[398:52.66]And they would just get all mushed up and it would only work for like not even a day.
[398:58.16]You'd be going through like 50 loaves of bread a week.
[399:02.69]Loafers.
[399:17.66]Okay.
[399:17.86]Alright.
[399:20.39]Yeah, and then when we got, you know, it was a huge deal.
[399:24.78]When we got like the big pieces of naan bread.
[399:28.02]It was awesome.
[399:31.96]I think like 10 loaves of naan bread might actually be more money than like two or three pairs of shoes.
[399:45.58]How much is a pair of just shitty sneakers?
[399:48.44]How much is a pair of just, like, I just go buy... Here's another great thing about... When we talk about the computer that's all the way to the left at Best Buy, what is the shoe all the way to the left at the shoe store?
[400:03.62]What's, like, the Del Inspiron of the shoe world?
[400:09.38]$20 at Walmart?
[400:13.42]Like, $15?
[400:13.66]Like, Crocs?
[400:19.53]New Balance, Omega Low.
[400:22.13]Knock Off Toms.
[400:29.20]Just go to Payless.
[400:35.88]These ones.
[400:36.50]Walmart Images.
[400:39.40]What is this fucked up website?
[400:40.16]i5.walmartimages.ca What the fuck is this?
[400:55.81]Those are virus shoes.
[401:02.59]It's Canadian.
[401:05.89]It's Canadian Walmart?
[401:07.65]Why is it Walmart images?
[401:13.56]How much are these?
[401:14.22]Are these expensive?
[401:22.38]How much do these cost?
[401:37.47]I mean, they have max toe.
[401:39.75]Maximum toes in there.
[401:49.11]But does that mean you can fit 10 in there?
[401:50.75]The maximum toes that you have are 10.
[401:55.97]Like 10 out of 10 toes is the maximum.
[401:58.27]Could you fit both feet in there?
[402:12.04]That's the max size for Canadian.
[402:14.64]Whatever.
[402:19.43]I lost my place.
[402:20.35]I lost my place in the bits.
[402:25.82]There they are.
[402:28.26]Uh, where were we?
[402:30.33]Right here.
[402:31.93]A manly leprechaun.
[402:32.87]Thanks for $5.
[402:33.85]Jerma, this is my first time donating to a streamer.
[402:36.59]Glad you're my first.
[402:37.41]I don't know how often you take game recommendations from viewers, but you should play Fossil Fighters for the DS.
[402:43.64]It's a goofy, fun, and interesting game that could be entertaining to watch.
[402:51.74]What is this?
[402:52.52]Sloggers?
[402:55.78]Sloggers.
[402:58.04]I don't think I want to...
[403:07.94]Sloggers.
[403:10.90]Even saying that.
[403:13.64]Hey, what'd you get for a pair of shoes?
[403:16.24]Ah, you know.
[403:17.84]Sloggers.
[403:21.00]I got a good pair of sloggers.
[403:25.16]Why do I think when I think that?
[403:27.49]Do I think when you step down, the wet sound is heard?
[403:30.67]Like...
[403:34.02]Like, they're already pre-wet.
[403:35.62]They've been pre-wet.
[403:36.48]Like, they're dunked in water and held under there, so it gets into the foam and shit.
[403:43.47]My schluggers.
[403:52.71]Wait, what happened?
[403:54.25]Oh, manly leprechaun, right.
[403:55.29]Fossil fighters for the DS.
[403:59.38]There's a lot of cool DS games.
[404:04.23]Although I don't know how well it would run on an emulator, if you even use those.
[404:07.93]Just want to put a word in for what I think would be an underrated gem.
[404:11.36]Either way, keep up the good work and give Otto a belly rub from me.
[404:14.70]Will do.
[404:17.50]Absolutely will.
[404:22.50]Fossil Fighters rocks.
[404:25.79]Yeah, let me see.
[404:27.93]Just the name alone is making me go, hmm.
[404:31.11]So you got me.

[405:18.09]Hey, Jerma, probably can't donate for a while, but I'm grateful for everything that you do.
[405:23.50]You've already given way more money than I could ever imagine somebody would ever give to an E-Clown.
[405:30.42]So thanks for the huge amount of money you've given.
[405:33.86]Appreciate it.

[408:12.21]This is cool.
[408:14.63]Hey, it's a short hike.
[408:17.21]I would make it more than an hour.

[409:39.61]Didn't somebody, somebody gave me $250 to say to do that.
[409:46.45]I would only be, I'm only playing myself here.
[409:49.33]Huh.
[409:50.69]Shows you, chat.
[409:51.65]I spent $400 on a GameCube game.
[409:53.83]Oh, that's... I did that.
[409:55.50]I have to live with that.
[409:56.96]I have to buy that game for $400.
[409:59.56]You don't have to do that.
[410:01.06]You could literally just open up a YouTube, like, gameplay video of it right now and just watch it for, like, an hour and be like, oh, this is stupid.
[410:07.85]Huh.
[410:08.27]Okay.

[412:08.07]Worm Club, thanks for 250.
[412:10.08]Incoming haha weed, so sorry for that one.
[412:12.30]But one time, some friends forced me to listen to Neil Cicerega's Mouth Moods for hours while I was way too high and it was a really upsetting experience.
[412:20.33]It still haunts me.
[412:24.28]That's...
[412:30.24]Hey, Bugsmoke, thanks for 250.
[412:32.08]Jerma, thanks for all the good content over the years.
[412:34.40]You know, I used to hate your TF2 videos.
[412:38.04]I used to hate your TF2 video phase before actually watching and realizing you were funny.
[412:44.15]Oh, glad you turned.
[412:48.71]By the by, by the way, if you ever play Roblox on stream, look up the Roblox Hellzone Galleria 2.0 and play it.
[412:59.10]GPM played it on stream and loved it.
[413:01.40]She gave everyone a laugh.
[413:04.52]I've seen a lot of MonkaS's.
[413:05.62]I'm sure that is probably a normal zone.
[413:11.24]But, hey.
[413:12.32]Thanks for watching.
[413:14.28]Used to hate the videos and now you like them.
[413:21.12]Appreciate it.
[413:23.32]He got infected by you.
[413:28.68]bingo sunshine thanks to the 250 remember these streams convinced me to pick up the game albeit through nefarious means because physical copies cost 100 times more than this donation laughing my ass off anyway the game is gorgeously emulated it's entirely legal to own backup copies of games you already own so would you consider emulation in the future for stuff that's going to be a display piece anyway that's the thought I've done it already no more heroes 1 was played on the dolphin
[414:01.12]Because no more heroes on the Wii runs like an absolute trash can.
[414:06.76]And I didn't want to put up with it.
[414:07.66]I didn't want to have you put up with it either.
[414:11.42]I admitted that.
[414:12.14]You guys already knew that.
[414:20.25]I don't... Look.
[414:23.61]The Wii is right here.
[414:25.73]The game disc is right there.
[414:27.49]And the Wiimote's right here.
[414:34.14]What do you mean I never told you?
[414:35.40]Yeah, I did.
[414:37.30]I talked about how it looked like it ran like such dog shit that I had to emulate it.
[414:45.03]I like held up the shit and I was like, look, look at me.
[414:58.52]Yeah, some games need it.
[415:00.26]Because they just don't run well.
[415:02.44]Here's another thing.
[415:04.24]Some games do not pull through a capture card well either.
[415:09.19]At all.
[415:12.35]You've seen some of those games that are like... Some of them sound horrible being pulled through capture cards and being scaled.
[415:24.65]So it's only out of necessity and I- and I only- if I own the games and own the consoles.
[415:31.25]I don't do it.
[415:31.91]Ever.
[415:40.84]I don't- I don't do it!
[415:41.72]I don't!
[415:43.20]I don't do this!
[415:45.68]Right dot dot dot right.
[415:52.58]That's dumb.
[416:02.96]right right okay let's keep going uh bingo sunshine yeah uh I hit there it is a thought on a lot of things but I consider everything I I consider all options maxi kaspersky thanks for the five dollars Jerma told me to never reverse and I've been accelerating into this brick wall for 15 minutes please help I'm going to run out of gas
[416:28.43]Hey, Medi Marin, thanks for the five dollars.
[416:32.75]Hello, Jerma, I have a question.
[416:34.87]I'm quite a bit of a workaholic.
[416:36.25]I have ADHD and I can't stop my head from thinking.
[416:39.01]So I try to think about productive things.
[416:41.07]Ever since quarantine, there's nothing left for me to do.
[416:43.79]Done all my work and chores, and despite there being nothing to do, I feel like I'm wasting away and failing at something that doesn't exist.
[416:48.57]Do you have any advice on how to teach myself to relax?
[416:51.93]Exercise.
[416:52.31]Exercise.
[416:54.23]Exercise.
[416:56.18]Jogging.
[416:57.56]Walking.
[416:58.76]Lifting.
[417:01.02]You can even do it in your house.
[417:02.68]Do it in your room.
[417:04.92]Push-ups.
[417:05.48]Sit-ups.
[417:13.47]That's not a bad idea.
[417:14.39]Yeah.
[417:20.83]Do them right now.
[417:24.49]Play an MMO.
[417:29.61]It's also good to stay at least somewhat active in the middle of something like a quarantine like this.
[417:36.67]Because if you, like for instance me right now, if I don't move around and I don't get up and do something or at least do light exercise, you really got to keep yourself loose.
[417:51.15]And other people said do something creative.
[417:52.69]Start painting.
[417:56.82]I'm not sure where you are.
[417:57.68]I'm not sure if you can still get Amazon deliveries or if that's a possibility.
[418:02.33]It should be.
[418:04.95]Order some paints.
[418:06.77]Have them just dropped at the door.
[418:07.79]Do some painting.
[418:10.66]Who cares?
[418:11.54]Have fun.
[418:16.94]You could read.
[418:18.55]You could.
[418:22.47]Take a bath.
[418:23.41]I love baths.
[418:24.19]I've become a huge bath fan.
[418:26.61]I love just lighting a candle, getting in the bath, and you just sit there and you just take it in.
[418:33.96]Have some salts.
[418:35.12]Sprinkled.
[418:36.48]Lightly.
[418:41.00]I've been so into baths recently.
[418:42.80]I really have.
[418:43.80]Omega Lo, rip the iPad.
[418:45.06]Just don't dunk your iPad in there.
[418:48.27]Just don't dunk your iPad in there.
[418:49.93]I lied about that, like, an hour ago.
[418:52.44]Don't do that.
[418:53.26]Don't, like, drop your iPad in the water.
[418:54.80]Like, I made that whole thing up.
[418:56.86]So, like, don't, like, do that.
[418:58.04]It's wacky.
[419:00.92]No, it actually did happen.
[419:08.25]I wish you luck, though, in this trying time.
[419:14.88]Thanks for the five dollars.
[419:15.68]Also, thanks for five dollars to Dr. Clay.
[419:17.72]I have a dumb dad joke for you.
[419:19.18]What do you call a prank a Jedi pulls using the Force?
[419:23.94]He got you, Force.
[419:25.36]You banned.
[419:26.46]You banned till tomorrow.
[419:34.60]See you at the Patapon stream.
[419:39.78]It was cute.
[419:40.54]I liked it.
[419:41.16]Don't ban him.
[419:43.58]Just scare him.
[419:46.19]Like where to live?
[419:47.29]I mean if you can live in Boston
[420:16.27]There's a lot of awesome places in Boston.
[420:18.61]You can just walk to everything.
[420:21.96]There's so many great bars and restaurants and just stuff to do if you live in city limits.
[420:34.45]Just go live in a bar.
[420:35.55]It is expensive.
[420:40.63]It is expensive.
[420:42.25]It is expensive.
[420:44.59]Oh, he just said, go to hell.
[420:45.97]Why?
[420:48.37]Ban that person until tomorrow's Patapon stream.
[420:52.81]Wait, no, no.
[420:53.21]He's talking about go live in hell.
[420:54.73]Oh, no, no.
[420:55.77]They're safe.
[420:56.15]That's fine.
[420:59.79]I would say if you can, in the city is awesome.
[421:04.70]If you're able to afford it.
[421:05.82]It can get very expensive, though.
[421:12.26]Safe for now.
[421:20.58]Bossed in?
[421:21.20]More like bossed out.
[421:22.26]Hey Johnny, nice mountains thanks to 300 bits.
[421:32.33]Jerma, are you familiar with the Souls games?
[421:34.31]I've never heard of them.
[421:35.83]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[421:38.53]Don't get it.
[421:39.07]I don't know what that means.
[421:39.79]Is that like a meme?
[421:40.61]Did I just say something I wasn't supposed to say?
[421:42.33]Is there like a soulslike these nuts or something?
[421:47.07]I don't understand.
[421:49.42]Funny joke, I guess.
[421:53.57]Hey, Peaceful Haley, thanks for 250.
[421:56.81]Just wanted to say I appreciate you and your community a lot.
[421:59.15]Everyone is so kind to me.
[422:00.83]Also, I said this years ago, but I still look up to you, and I do want to stream.
[422:04.84]I'm just hard on myself, and I want to do this more than anything.
[422:07.98]Thanks for being the... Thanks for the backing up into traffic advice.
[422:11.60]Don't do that.
[422:23.57]Streaming is fun.
[422:24.83]Streaming is really, really, really awesome.
[422:30.79]But you want to, you got to want to do it.
[422:34.22]You shouldn't have any pressure to turn it on.
[422:37.70]And if your pressure is coming from needing to have to do it, and I'd say that might be a problem.
[422:48.69]Wanting and needing.
[422:49.53]Needing.
[422:52.42]You got to want to do it and just have fun doing it.
[422:54.82]And just don't think about anything else.
[423:00.03]Not at all.
[423:00.55]Yeah, that's good.
[423:02.25]Because the more that you start to need it, the more you're going to give yourself potentially unrealistic things that you have to do.
[423:24.80]Hope that helps.
[423:30.06]Like eating a shoe.
[423:31.60]We don't talk about that.
[423:36.86]What about wanting to stop on the highway?
[423:38.97]Ban that person and fucking don't let them drive.
[423:41.09]Alright, no, don't.
[423:44.95]They're okay.
[423:45.85]They're asking a question.
[423:49.84]Hey, bingo, Sunshine.
[423:50.67]Thanks for the 250 Jerma.
[423:51.67]The point was the games look and sound better emulated.
[423:54.15]Just emulate them.
[423:54.95]I mean, that's what I said.
[424:03.53]But I kind of, I like putting the disc in and I like loading up the... Like, oh, you actually don't get to hear that.
[424:12.64]I always mute that part.
[424:14.96]Got you.
[424:17.54]Um, I like to bone stuff.
[424:24.91]I, and it's, it hasn't been that big of a problem.
[424:31.67]Plus, like, let's be honest.
[424:34.21]I know that it's, anybody can just sit here and go, just do it.
[424:39.11]Just do it.
[424:39.82]It's fine.
[424:40.46]Nobody cares.
[424:41.30]Twitch doesn't care.
[424:42.70]They don't care.
[424:43.86]But if somebody ever wanted to,
[424:48.66]it's still it's still technically illegal you know what I'm saying so like I have to just be I have to be careful I don't want to be like yeah everything I own is pirated here's my folder with 300 GameCube games in it I didn't buy a thing hi I'm germa985 streamer with 6 000 people watching don't you know look at this you can just get all this for free
[425:16.94]I gotta, like, be care- I don't wanna- I gotta be careful.
[425:19.82]You listen to copyrighted music, that's just as illegal, dumbass.
[425:33.50]Um.
[425:38.04]That's- no, it's not.
[425:40.56]Playing a Mighty Mighty Bastos song.
[425:43.94]from the YouTube channel of Mighty Mighty Bossstones.
[425:48.40]You can't go to YouTube.com and open up a window with Gacha Force in it.
[426:04.32]You can.
[426:10.98]If they don't give you an easy, legitimate way to get the game, then fuck them.
[426:15.84]yes and I know I know I know but this this difference between listening to a song on stream and having thousands of dollars in game products downloaded to my hard drive that I did not pay for even if it's not available I just I just have to be careful
[426:44.90]I just laughed so hard my parents probably woke up.
[426:52.50]Sure, Roger that, Mr. Boomer.
[427:06.47]And, like, Nintendo games, isn't Nintendo, like, do not fucking do that?
[427:15.07]They've removed all the- They cease and desist fucking people hosting that shit all the time.
[427:19.71]It's been seven hours.
[427:28.07]What happened to, oh, I can't stream for more than four hours?
[427:30.45]I had to beat GachiForce.
[427:35.34]And, I mean, the stream has been over for like an hour or two.
[427:39.04]We've just been hanging out.
[427:40.48]But I did say that.
[427:41.62]I did say I didn't want to go more than six to seven hours.
[427:45.74]I said so- No, I did say that sometimes, needing to finish stuff, I would be able to- it would be okay.
[427:52.50]But it's primarily to... avoid my- just completely give me a hard wall to not have, like, 8 plus hour streams ever again.
[428:08.95]The same Nintendo sells shitty ports of Super Mario World on every console for $20.
[428:14.45]Yeah, but they still sell it.
[428:15.97]That's the point.
[428:19.35]Look, I'm not gonna sit here and, like, argue any, like, copyright.
[428:24.07]They deserve to charge that.
[428:25.27]They don't.
[428:25.99]Fuck those companies.
[428:27.59]I've used emulators on this stream.
[428:29.13]You've seen it.
[428:31.52]And I probably will continue to do so.
[428:35.16]If I, you know, find it necessary.
[428:40.36]I mean, what?
[428:40.62]What?
[428:41.24]What?
[428:48.66]You didn't buy the DOS games, monkaS.
[428:50.42]Yeah, but the DOS games are like, archived into fucking- They're like- Archive.org is like the public domain of all things.
[429:07.87]It's Abandonware, yeah.
[429:11.63]Playing Abandonware versus Capcom still owns the rights to Viewtiful Joe.
[429:20.34]Like, Capcom didn't go, you know what?
[429:22.44]Beautiful Joe is abandonware now.
[429:25.20]No, they have that shit under lock and key.
[429:33.04]But they aren't doing anything with it.
[429:36.56]Welcome to my argument for why won't Geno just be added as a Nintendo character.
[429:49.98]There's been like three or four cases where Nintendo employees have been like, yeah, that's a cool character.
[429:54.56]Maybe that would be fun.
[429:55.44]Wow.
[429:56.30]Oh, Geno's really cool.
[429:58.24]Yeah.
[429:59.76]He's just locked in a cage at Square Enix.
[430:04.50]Hey, Square Enix, are you ever going to use that character?
[430:07.50]Nope.
[430:10.11]Can I use that character?
[430:11.73]Nope.
[430:15.79]They're doing business with you.
[430:21.12]That happens a lot.
[430:24.96]Long story short.
[430:25.64]I just gotta be careful.
[430:32.73]Whether I use it or don't use it, I know everyone's saying, this person does it, this person does it.
[430:38.19]I know.
[430:39.05]And that's alright.
[430:39.77]I do too.
[430:49.04]We say hi to peaches.
[430:50.04]Hey peaches!
[430:50.66]Welcome to the stream!
[430:58.34]See you tomorrow.
[431:00.52]Have a good day.
[431:02.09]A good day?
[431:08.09]It's a good night.
[431:08.67]What am I talking about?
[431:10.51]I'll see you tomorrow for Patapon.
[431:13.67]Either Patapon 1 or Patapon 2.
[431:17.26]Me and pre-stream chat tomorrow are going to decide the thing I was going to tell you.
[431:25.15]Okay.
[431:26.91]This is really, really, really deep, heavy, heavy spoiler.
[431:30.17]Heavy.
[431:30.98]No, no, no!
[431:32.94]I'm gonna do this one day.
[431:34.40]No, you don't get- I'm sorry.
[431:37.04]I- but that's a big spoiler!
[431:42.37]No, I, like, hate that.
[431:43.65]Oh, I hate, like, I don't want to type, like, the fucking, like, a huge, boy, I don't, I hate that.
[431:50.23]Okay, it looks like something.
[431:52.16]Oh, I can't.
[431:54.60]I don't like doing that, because people, you could, like, clip me saying this.
[431:58.26]Just, like, give it to somebody and be like, hey, look!
[432:00.62]And they'll click it and be like, thanks.
[432:02.26]Ugh.
[432:06.54]Okay.
[432:08.10]Okay.
[432:11.55]Let me just finish the bits.
[432:12.39]Hey, jcupbra.
[432:17.10]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[432:18.60]I am a newer viewer.
[432:20.12]I'm watching for about three months.
[432:21.28]Well, welcome to the channel.
[432:23.58]I thought it was pretty cool to see a streamer who used to live in my hometown.
[432:26.18]You're a funny dude.
[432:27.64]And I'm glad to watch some more in the future.
[432:29.44]Any advice on starting a YouTube channel?
[432:31.70]Just go.
[432:32.50]Just do it.
[432:34.07]See what happens.
[432:35.49]But I did.
[432:37.47]See what happens.
[432:42.92]No, the just do it forehead is actual advice for this.
[432:52.86]Started 10 years ago.
[433:03.31]True.
[433:05.07]True.
[433:05.61]I...
[433:10.00]best advice you give to anybody starting any new creative endeavor is go for it do it as best as you can and try to set realistic expectations do it for fun do it because you like it do because you want to tell something do because you want to show something same advice I would give for anything don't do something because you feel like you have to do it do it because you want to do it and do it as best as you can
[433:39.66]If something good happens, if you get some viewers, then fucking awesome.
[433:43.06]Keep going.
[433:43.94]Keep doing it.
[433:45.16]If you don't get any viewers right at the bat, keep going.
[433:49.59]Just keep doing it.
[433:52.03]And then find out over the months, coming weeks and months, if it's something that you actually wanted to do.
[434:03.38]You've said this advice six times today.
[434:05.70]Well, it was asked at six separate times.
[434:08.50]And people might not be here.
[434:09.66]They might have left.
[434:11.74]It's homework advice.
[434:19.53]Don't take YouTuber advice from this X-Tuber.
[434:22.33]That's another thing.
[434:23.03]I don't know the game at all.
[434:24.69]And I never did.
[434:25.29]I didn't know.
[434:29.47]Do you think I knew what I was fucking doing?
[434:33.91]when it came to like how to make it big on YouTube.
[434:39.99]I like ran somebody over with a car in GTA and laughed at it.
[434:44.29]What happened?
[434:44.89]How did I get here?
[434:57.77]Now, obviously, I put a lot of work into that channel.
[435:01.47]And a lot of stuff that I really cared about.
[435:03.39]That's a jokey little, like, it's a funny thing.
[435:07.24]I spent a lot of work.
[435:08.42]I spent a lot of time on that channel.
[435:12.88]In quotes, work.
[435:13.64]Aren't you supposed to be banned?
[435:15.68]Wait, I'm not supposed to read what you say.
[435:17.54]You don't ban that person until tomorrow's Patapon stream.
[435:21.23]And I actually mean that this time.
[435:24.23]No, actually, yeah.
[435:25.89]I'm not supposed to read what you say.
[435:27.73]I'm not supposed to read you.
[435:29.51]Now you've gone until tomorrow's had upon stream.
[435:33.08]I'm about to turn the stream off and now I'm not... Tomorrow, you're not going to see me until tomorrow.
[435:44.79]What was I talking about?
[435:45.63]Oh, yeah.
[435:48.56]I would just get ideas and do them.
[435:50.36]And if people thought they were funny, or they liked them, then they did.
[435:52.64]And if they didn't, then they didn't.
[435:53.70]And I just kept doing them.
[435:56.38]There's a shitload of channels that people didn't think were very good.
[435:59.64]And that's okay.
[436:01.02]I learned, and I tried to make them better.
[436:04.34]There are videos people thought were some of the best things that I've ever done.
[436:08.00]You learn, you say, okay, did that work?
[436:10.67]Let me do more of that.
[436:11.67]Let me try some more of that.
[436:16.39]Ow.
[436:17.37]Why did you just hit me?
[436:19.98]But, um, incredibly long-winded word fucking soup.
[436:22.44]I always go into word soup after, like, six or seven hours.
[436:26.34]Um, do it because you want to, not because you need to.
[436:29.46]That's, like, the best advice I can give to anybody doing anything creatively.
[436:32.10]Thanks for the three bucks.
[436:36.65]We only have three more donations from Heldrich.
[436:39.01]Five dollars.
[436:40.93]Jeremiah, I found a glowing review for Gacha Force from 2004.
[436:44.34]If you wanted some vindication.
[436:46.56]Also, there exist toys in manga and a manga series, but they're all extremely hard to find.
[436:50.80]Anyways, keep it up.
[436:53.26]From Nintendo World Report.
[436:56.20]Oh, yeah.
[436:58.36]The tagline is, it's the best unofficial Transformers game ever.
[437:01.78]I'm gonna give it for score.
[437:08.06]graphics 7 sound 3 control 7 gameplay 8.5 last ability 9 final score of 8.
[437:25.03]Pros here are multiplayer features, respectable computer allies and opponents, simple and fun combat system, and tons of cool and unique borgs.
[437:35.68]Cons, ear-burning voice clips, only story mode unlocks new borgs, and there are camera problems.
[437:48.48]We're doing cheese toasties with tomato soup.
[437:50.49]Sign me up.
[437:52.97]That sounds incredible.

[438:41.42]You ready?
[438:44.98]I'm going to talk.
