[31:31.50]So here's what we're gonna do.
[31:33.04]Let's do the credits right now.
[31:35.36]Thank you, everybody.

[31:44.27]Get the Yeti, okay.
[31:45.87]Well, first of all, let's just make this very clear.
[31:48.09]Sorry for the last two days of short streams for obvious reasons.
[31:51.57]I'm not gonna be here.
[31:52.90]I'm getting on an airplane, going to Las Vegas.
[31:55.14]I'll be back in a week.
[31:57.22]I'm gonna try to do a stream in Vegas.
[32:02.31]So I cannot guarantee it'll happen depending on like coverage and how much, you know, data that's going to be.
[32:07.69]But you might see the short stream from the Vegas room, like hotel room or something.
[32:14.30]So take care, everybody.
[32:18.30]What day?
[32:18.86]Oh, I have no idea.
[32:21.46]I'm just going to put the title to just have the stuff be like.
[32:26.99]maybe a stream from Vegas.
[32:29.01]That's it.
[32:29.89]And then I'm going to make the title obviously that I'm not around until next week.
[32:34.95]But wish me luck.
[32:36.85]We are going to go get a place and then it becomes real.
[32:40.97]So sorry again.

[32:57.37]No, I have no idea when it's going to happen.
[32:58.83]We're going to be very busy, so I can't give you like a time and date.
[33:02.66]I would just say there might be a stream from Vegas.

[37:23.86]Hey, Jerma.
[37:26.00]Some people have suggested that at the end of the stream, bit reading has become show Jerma your work to me.
[37:32.14]Plus, with the eventual green screen, you're going to be flooded with even more videos.
[37:35.74]That's true.
[37:36.70]I thought I'd help speed up the whole process for everyone with this handy template.
[37:40.30]Now I and the other artist meme makers can pretend to get acknowledgement we desperately crave without spending precious bits.
[37:47.31]Corner!
[37:49.63]Alright, that's it.
[37:50.85]Oh, it's like a green screen template.
[37:57.98]Oh my God.
[37:58.62]There you go.
[38:00.22]That's fucking hilarious.
[38:02.22]Thank you, It's Time for Slime, and your amazing artwork.

[38:48.65]So have a wonderful week, guys.
[38:50.81]I will try to catch up with you soon over the next six or seven days.
[38:55.97]But if not, I'll do something stupid on Twitter.
[39:00.73]I'll eat a donut on Twitter and scream with a donut in my mouth so you can't hear me.
[39:04.89]You know what I mean?
[39:05.43]It might be funny.
[39:07.43]Thank you for watching.
