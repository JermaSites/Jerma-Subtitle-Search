[00:03.02]Hello.
[00:03.38]Hi.
[00:09.56]How are you doing?
[00:12.04]What's going on?
[00:23.22]Explain yourself.
[00:25.00]Okay, fine.
[00:28.06]Guess I'll explain myself.
[00:31.95]Uh, so I woke up today and I had a bad headache.
[00:34.23]As in, I did the thing where you just pop two Tylenol, go lie down in bed, and just like sit there and pray with your eyes closed.
[00:41.76]Going, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away.
[00:46.26]Well, you don't do that, that'll make your headache worse, but.
[00:50.46]Um, yeah, I'm okay.
[00:53.00]It seems to have, uh, subsided.
[00:56.81]A little.
[00:57.09]So don't be too loud.
[01:00.73]I would like if everybody could please lower your volume a little bit.
[01:05.17]I've got a headache today.
[01:08.24]Can you imagine going to a concert or going to a live event?
[01:15.42]And the person you're going to see comes out on stage and you're like cheering.
[01:21.19]This person goes, hold on, wait, wait, guys, guys, excuse me.
[01:24.01]I have a headache today.
[01:27.94]If you could just kind of lower your volume and not be so excited.
[01:33.50]And they do their whole routine and every time that somebody, the crowd laughs.
[01:38.46]Like that big crowd laugh.
[01:40.09]It's just like, stop, stop.
[01:41.75]I told you guys.
[01:43.11]Please.
[01:45.83]Get it together.
[01:46.51]This is ridiculous.
[01:47.91]I'm gonna leave.
[01:50.63]Hangover, Andy.
[01:51.61]I don't, I don't have a hangover.
[01:53.25]I didn't, I didn't drink anything.
[02:00.86]That would actually be pretty funny.
[02:08.67]Oh, I just get headaches.
[02:10.45]I'm just a headache Andy.
[02:15.15]I, uh... I've had an MRI of my brain.
[02:17.93]So, there's nothing immediately concerning, apparently.
[02:22.41]This is ongoing for like a decade plus.
[02:24.76]So don't worry, I'm okay.
[02:27.56]But today, we've got some stuff...
[02:32.59]going on.
[02:33.11]I'm gonna play GeoGuessr.
[02:40.37]On cam, that's right, I'm gonna be on camera today.
[02:42.77]And then we're gonna play Dying Light 2 again with Stirr.
[02:50.08]So I'll play GeoGuessr for like, maybe like an hour or two, maybe, we'll see.
[02:55.06]Somewhere around like 4, 4.30 we're gonna ping Stirr and be like, hey, ready to get back into the world of Dying Light?
[03:03.76]He's gonna go, yeah, dude.
[03:06.20]So let's go.
[03:06.62]I think we've spent enough time here.
[03:09.04]Let me clear my throat.
[03:12.90]Let me take a sip of water.
[03:16.34]No cheating?
[03:19.06]How do you cheat at GeoGuessr?
[03:25.67]I don't get it.
[03:26.09]Don't you have to just kind of guess where you are?
[03:33.92]Did you guys progress in Dying Light at all?
[03:35.66]Well, um, kind of.
[03:41.28]Kind of?
[03:42.41]Uh... Well, we're not playing Dying Light yet, so we'll tell you about it after.
[03:51.23]We didn't play anymore.
[03:54.18]We may have progressed.
[03:56.62]We might have.
[04:04.67]You can't look up companies or addresses.
[04:06.49]Oh, that's fine.
[04:08.20]I didn't do that anyways.
[04:09.02]No, we're just gonna see if I can know where I am.
[04:14.30]Let's go ahead and get it on the screen right now.
[04:18.46]Hold on, let me click this.
[04:22.20]Wait, hold on.
[04:25.82]Do you guess it's a premium service now?
[04:27.53]Yeah, I already bought it.
[04:29.75]I saw the five minute thing and I was like, that's not gonna work.
[04:38.58]So we're not limited to the 5 minutes and then 15 minutes.
[04:46.76]Where's our 100 community subs?
[04:48.16]I still can't figure out what's going on.
[04:49.96]So I am in the process of trying to figure out why that's happening.
[04:55.38]So there's real debt on this channel now that I have not paid yet.
[05:00.64]The jokey 2 billion debt thing was a funny joke, but now it's real.
[05:05.66]I owe 100 community subs that I haven't paid yet.
[05:09.82]actually have uh actually have a real debt that I have to pay so I have not found a solution yet I'm going to figure that out very soon I promise just keep it add it to the tab alright here we go you ready oh I had a crazy dream too I'll tell you that it's fucked up can you see me
[05:43.60]Okay, so we're going to play GeoGuessr.
[05:47.54]It's going to be fun.
[05:50.74]This is all like a new menu.
[05:52.02]I don't know what any of this is.
[05:56.48]What is all this stuff?
[06:02.00]Beard, yeah.
[06:03.20]I have to shave.
[06:04.04]It's getting bad.
[06:05.46]It's getting too long.
[06:08.24]Don't ask us.
[06:09.02]But yeah, look, this is like a completely new website.
[06:13.15]I don't know.
[06:13.65]I don't get it.
[06:16.23]Explorer mode, daily challenge, world, famous places.
[06:19.15]Should I just do world?
[06:20.57]What's like the regular one?
[06:24.41]Just do world.
[06:25.01]That's what I'm going to do.
[06:28.07]There's sound effects too.
[06:29.67]Hold on.
[06:32.13]Single player.
[06:32.61]Yeah.
[06:32.95]Alright.
[06:33.15]Default setting.
[06:33.71]No time limit.
[06:34.33]Moving around.
[06:34.81]Yeah.
[06:35.03]Start.
[06:35.99]You ready?
[06:36.31]I want to full screen this.
[06:41.22]Like this.
[06:41.78]Yes.
[06:42.10]Okay.
[06:44.52]Alright.
[06:46.14]Where the heck are we?
[06:47.16]That's my new series on Twitch.
[06:50.48]If you check it out, you check out the title.
[06:51.99]The title of the stream is, Where the heck even are we, guys?
[06:55.93]Let's go ahead and start.
[07:01.21]Okay.
[07:01.73]Looks a little industrial.
[07:06.82]Hmm.
[07:10.92]I don't think this is North America.
[07:15.69]If I were to take a guess, right off the bat, immediately, I would say it's somewhere in Europe.
[07:24.32]Either Europe or... I don't know.
[07:29.24]The default answer for everywhere, if you don't think it's America, is Russia, right?
[07:35.71]No, this doesn't look like somewhere in Kentucky.
[07:38.19]It's Russia.
[07:39.45]Like, that's not... It never is.
[07:42.47]I mean, it could be.
[07:43.23]Wait, what was that sign?
[07:49.37]Wait, go back.
[07:49.99]How do I zoom in?
[07:51.31]It's just mouse scroll, right?
[07:52.83]What's that?
[07:57.96]What's that say?
[08:00.58]Uh, Parza?
[08:02.00]Well, I don't know what that says.
[08:05.38]Alright, I'm gonna say Italy.
[08:17.17]I think it's somewhere in Italy.
[08:18.21]Italy.
[08:22.09]I think that was Italian.
[08:26.71]Tim's?
[08:30.45]No, that's not, that's not Italian.
[08:33.42]Zeebee's.
[08:36.28]Wait a minute.
[08:43.56]Russia.
[08:44.84]This is Russia.
[08:48.84]That's Russian.
[08:51.77]I don't know what language that is.
[08:52.95]Alright, it's de- Okay, it's not here.
[08:58.17]So let's go over here.
[08:59.07]I've been doing the thing where I'm just holding the mug.
[09:00.75]Okay.
[09:03.97]Here?
[09:09.11]Let's keep going.
[09:09.69]Alright.
[09:10.19]There's no time limit, but I feel like there kind of should be.
[09:12.91]Maybe I should turn it on.
[09:15.07]Because eventually I'll figure it out, right?
[09:16.61]Okay, what does this say?
[09:21.50]I... I-N-A.
[09:26.16]Wait, what's that?
[09:30.10]Ineos.
[09:31.47]Wait, what?
[09:33.07]This is Japan!
[09:35.93]This is... We're in Japan!
[09:39.27]What?
[09:40.97]No, that's... This can't... No, what?
[09:42.83]This is not Japan.
[09:44.13]What flag is this?
[09:44.99]This is not... Is that the Jap... That's not the Japanese flag.
[09:51.74]What is that?
[09:52.30]I don't know what flag that is.
[09:55.94]Okay, wait.
[09:56.56]It's probably like here.
[09:59.74]Of course this is in fucking Japan.
[10:01.44]Am I stupid?
[10:05.90]Alright, I'm gonna say- Wait!
[10:08.08]They got the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man over here.
[10:17.71]What happened?
[10:18.25]I thought my screen got- Why is there a bullet hole in my screen?
[10:24.14]I honestly thought there was something wrong with my monitor for one second.
[10:26.53]I was like, why is there a fucking bullet hole?
[10:29.17]What is that?
[10:29.63]It's a tree?
[10:34.81]Alright, I get it.
[10:35.79]I'm going.
[10:36.44]I'm going.
[10:36.96]We're going right here.
[10:43.00]In Lita.
[10:44.68]I'm guessing.
[10:45.10]Let's go.
[10:48.27]That's not bad.
[10:50.79]Where was it?
[10:52.82]Slovenia.
[10:54.46]Okay.
[10:54.88]That wasn't that bad.
[10:59.58]Or, no.
[11:00.22]Croatia.
[11:00.68]Okay.
[11:02.78]I mean, it was across the entire continent, but whatever.
[11:10.82]Okay.
[11:11.86]Now this... This is the United States of America.
[11:18.58]Orange... Orange Road.
[11:25.05]Keep left.
[11:29.96]I feel like that sign needs to be a little bigger because it looks like it's been run over like a hundred times.
[11:38.44]I feel like they need to make this a little more elaborate.
[11:46.83]Hold on, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
[11:50.03]We need to see a business or something here.
[11:56.82]At Hurst Golf Range.
[12:01.08]It's somewhere in the south.
[12:02.57]But is it though?
[12:03.49]I don't know.
[12:07.33]I don't know.
[12:07.73]I don't think so.
[12:09.71]Now that we're looking at it for another minute.
[12:17.37]Am I gonna take a sip of this fucking coffee already?
[12:20.49]I've been holding- how long has this stream been live?
[12:22.55]I've been holding this right here for 13 minutes, and I haven't sipped out of it yet.
[12:30.36]What's that?
[12:34.12]School zone, 8 to 9, 2.30 to 4, 40, wait.
[12:40.42]Does it say you can go 40 in a school zone?
[12:46.95]Isn't that way too fast?
[12:50.26]40?
[12:53.76]That's zooming in a school zone.
[13:02.00]Oh, I thought it was like 60 in a school zone.
[13:07.27]Holy shit.
[13:10.35]Alright.
[13:10.65]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13:11.55]What's this?
[13:11.83]Stop.
[13:12.01]Stop.
[13:16.10]It's probably, I think it's in the south.
[13:17.78]40 miles per hour school zone.
[13:26.48]Where's the school?
[13:30.30]Where's the school?
[13:31.26]N school zone was on this side of the road.
[13:32.86]Where is it?
[13:33.26]Is that a school?
[13:39.10]Is that a school?
[13:41.42]Jeremy, you're pretending.
[13:42.84]I am not pretending.
[13:48.44]There's a flag right here.
[13:51.30]But it's like folded over.
[13:52.72]I don't know what that says.
[13:53.78]That's Australia?
[14:05.11]Yeah, but you don't know that.
[14:06.29]Wait.
[14:14.72]Wait.
[14:21.82]Closure day in boarding college, pre-kindergarten to year 12.
[14:26.08]Oh, shit!
[14:27.23]S-U.
[14:27.67]Eh... And... I don't know why I thought that was not safe for work.
[14:36.05]What?
[14:36.33]I was like, what are you talking about?
[14:39.60]Scott Saints... N-S... Like, what the fuck?
[14:45.14]Alright, that's the AU.
[14:46.14]We're in Australia.
[14:50.97]But where in Australia?
[14:54.05]Australia is fucking huge.
[14:59.31]I know absolutely nothing about Australia.
[15:01.79]Nothing.
[15:05.17]I would say... Let me keep going.
[15:09.14]Wait!
[15:09.86]N... Oh shit!
[15:11.52]That's right!
[15:12.26]NSW!
[15:15.74]Stop cheating!
[15:16.56]I wouldn't have gotten that.
[15:21.31]Oh, I think it's pretty close to Sydney, Mike.
[15:26.32]Alright, got it.
[15:26.90]Stop cheating.
[15:27.52]Alright, now I'm not going to look at chat for the rest of the... I'm not going to look at chat.
[15:30.70]Alright, this is... Leaves are turning, which could mean many things.
[15:43.74]Is that a...
[15:50.33]A-L-F-L.
[15:52.95]Something kids.
[15:53.59]I can't tell.
[15:58.46]I can't read it.
[15:58.90]I think it's like a state or something in there.
[16:07.04]I'm not going to look over a chat, I swear to God.
[16:08.60]I'm seeing leaves turn, which only happens in New England.
[16:13.66]The leaves only turn in fucking Boston.
[16:16.29]They don't turn anywhere else.
[16:19.72]You guys ever been to Maine?
[16:20.68]Don't look at chat.
[16:24.58]Wait, what's this?
[16:29.53]Birch Harbor Estates.
[16:33.31]Okay.
[16:37.31]Birch Harbor.
[16:38.08]This is definitely either all the way up or all the way down.
[16:44.84]All the way up or all the way down.
[16:52.68]I don't think... Hold on.
[16:56.98]Let's keep moving.
[17:01.01]What's that say?
[17:03.39]Only, only, alright, nothing.
[17:04.77]Wait, we got a... We got a business up here.
[17:12.17]Alaska.
[17:13.13]It was AL.
[17:14.51]Okay, this is Alaska.
[17:15.57]I told you, either all the way up or all the way down, we're in Alaska.
[17:21.32]Three Bears, Alaska.
[17:26.29]Is that the name of the town?
[17:27.29]Did they just put that there to make it so people that play GeoGuessr would know what town it is?
[17:33.45]Is there a Three Bears, Alaska?
[17:35.23]Delta Junction.
[17:42.46]This is definitely not on a coast, I don't think.
[17:44.02]I think it's pretty much in.
[17:44.88]But Alaska is fucking huge, too.
[17:46.86]It's so... Wait.
[17:47.96]My facecam's in a bad spot, isn't it?
[17:52.23]I put my facecam top, like, middle right.
[17:53.99]Yeah, we'll do this.
[17:59.37]Let me move facecam.
[18:00.57]Top right, but then you can't see that.
[18:01.99]I didn't want to turn the facecam off.
[18:09.66]No, wrong fucking button again.
[18:15.80]Wrong button again.
[18:18.88]Wrong button again.
[18:22.03]What the fuck am I, what's my OBS doing?
[18:29.91]Oh, okay, that's better.
[18:31.23]That's good.
[18:34.55]Alright, so we're in Three Bears, Alaska, which who knows where the hell that is.
[18:43.50]Stop looking at chat.
[18:49.02]Alright, well, we know we're in Alaska.
[18:50.22]Let's see if we can get a town.
[18:57.23]Oh, nope.
[18:59.35]Anything else here that would give it away?
[19:07.38]Liquor, grocery, pharmacy, fresh meat, fresh produce, sporting goods.
[19:13.82]This has got everything.
[19:14.60]This is an everything store.
[19:19.17]Sporting goods, too?
[19:23.07]Well, there's produce there.
[19:23.99]What does that mean?
[19:27.10]I'm giving it like another minute.
[19:30.31]Fresh produce.
[19:31.65]I said the word wrong for a second.
[19:33.95]Like, please.
[19:42.57]Auto care.
[19:47.03]No, nothing there.
[19:47.95]It's definitely in the middle.
[19:49.73]I see mountains in the distance though.
[19:54.84]Wait, almost all of Alaska is a mountain.
[19:57.02]That doesn't help me at all.
[19:57.96]Wait, or does it?
[20:01.05]Look at this over here.
[20:06.11]This is pretty mountainous up here, and it's pretty mountainous down here.
[20:14.92]See that in the distance over there?
[20:16.62]I think this is the clue.
[20:19.80]My voice is such junk.
[20:25.37]Because that's a mountain.
[20:26.21]We're either really far away here or... Okay, here we go.
[20:28.39]Ready?
[20:31.41]Oh my god!
[20:32.13]What's wrong with me?
[20:35.01]Grizzly group.
[20:37.58]Grizzly group cafe.
[20:41.46]Quilt Alaska.
[20:45.74]I'm going with the mountain technique.
[20:47.46]He's old.
[20:48.00]I know!
[20:48.73]I know!
[20:49.53]Shut up.
[20:51.39]What's that say?
[20:58.00]Or even ribs.
[20:59.40]That place is probably like 10 out of 10.
[21:00.44]Oh my god.
[21:06.32]Why is there like a Canadian geese congregation of mailboxes over here?
[21:14.83]This feels like... This feels like too many.
[21:17.01]Okay.
[21:18.37]We're in Quilt, Alaska?
[21:19.71]I don't know.
[21:20.21]I'm going for it.
[21:20.91]Here we go.
[21:22.07]We got the mountain range here.
[21:23.07]Mountain range here.
[21:23.53]I'm going to go.
[21:23.89]I think it's a little bit closer to Anchorage.
[21:25.18]Anchorage.
[21:28.55]I'm going to say it's like right here.
[21:31.01]Right between McGrath and Nikolai.
[21:37.25]That was actually pretty good.
[21:38.87]That's not bad.
[21:41.58]I really should have just said Anchorage.
[21:42.80]It's probably these mountains right here.
[21:49.48]This is like beautiful.
[21:51.60]Oh my god.
[21:52.32]This is like incredibly lush and gorgeous.
[21:56.56]Okay.
[21:57.32]Where are we?
[21:59.78]Hump.
[22:02.16]I think we call it bump in America.
[22:04.64]I don't think we call it hump.
[22:06.38]We call it bump.
[22:12.51]Who would say hump?
[22:16.01]This is a nice place.
[22:20.37]I see industry over here.
[22:24.66]Okay.
[22:25.20]Alright.
[22:25.56]Okay.
[22:28.04]Okay.
[22:30.48]We are in... Where are we?
[22:39.58]I saw a flag, and my brain is trying to figure out what flag that was, and I have a pretty good idea.
[22:46.28]But I'm not gonna say it, because I don't want to sound stupid.
[22:52.83]Oh, Chatsworth Road!
[22:54.17]That's where you guys live!
[22:59.93]Okay, it's over here.

[23:18.91]Chatsworth Road?
[23:20.25]Chatsworth Ave?
[23:21.27]Alright, what's going on over here?
[23:27.07]We've got buildings.
[23:27.81]We're in a city area.
[23:35.59]What's that?
[23:36.21]T. Chatsworth Road.
[23:46.03]Alright, I think I got an idea.
[23:53.30]Danger.
[23:53.94]High voltage.
[23:58.48]I'm not gonna look at chat.
[24:05.62]chatsworth road again what's that hold on this is like a park taxi what's that say max height limit three meters okay hold on what's that say passenger pickup I want to get over to that building I think I get a better idea
[24:41.96]Okay.
[24:45.62]It's somewhere over here.
[24:49.40]I think.
[24:53.32]What's with Chatsworth?
[24:54.57]Every road Chatsworth?
[25:10.45]Watch this video, like, somewhere like Louisiana or something, right?
[25:13.79]Like, what if I'm just completely wrong?
[25:15.81]But wait, it's all in English.
[25:19.34]Wait, what?
[25:21.28]And every road is Chatsworth!
[25:24.02]Where are we?
[25:26.86]Hold on.
[25:33.55]Times are changing.
[25:39.49]Times are changing.
[25:42.93]Hyundai, we build tomorrow.
[25:50.50]Okay, so Hyundai, hold on.
[26:00.20]They are building tomorrow?
[26:01.93]No, that's not what it means.
[26:05.22]That means like Hyundai, we build tomorrow.
[26:07.76]Like they're like a technology company.
[26:10.00]That's not what that means.
[26:13.06]That's not like announcing that they're going to be starting building tomorrow.
[26:16.10]That's them saying that we build tomorrow because they're a tech company.
[26:32.49]What flag is that?
[26:44.20]Road works.
[26:46.48]Whoa!
[26:46.98]That's... I love that little thing.
[26:52.28]That's so cool.
[26:54.53]Is it animated?
[26:55.21]Does it go like... Oh, that's so cool.
[27:00.17]Land transport authority.
[27:01.33]Alright.
[27:01.94]I think I know what this is.
[27:10.26]I know where this is.
[27:11.24]But I'm like too stupid to remember where it is.
[27:15.90]I just know that it exists in the world.
[27:19.84]I just need to figure out where it exists in the world.
[27:25.64]And I'm not going to say where it is.
[27:28.19]Because I don't want people to think I'm stupid.
[27:30.45]Because I don't know where it is.
[27:32.65]And I now know where it is.
[27:34.21]Okay?
[27:36.27]I now know where it is.
[27:38.72]I've narrowed it down to here.
[27:47.56]Ministry of Education Headquarters.
[27:50.16]But what country?
[27:59.92]Ahead.
[28:00.37]Humps.
[28:01.35]I don't... Hold on.
[28:12.93]I'm not leaving yet.
[28:14.07]What's that?
[28:15.07]Escape?
[28:17.18]I got it.
[28:18.16]I told you it was right here somewhere.
[28:19.78]And everyone thought I was stupid.
[28:20.78]Alright, where?
[28:24.06]Wait, wait a minute, wait.
[28:27.18]Is this an ad?
[28:29.67]Saying to come visit Malaysia.
[28:35.19]What if that's an ad saying like, hey, leave, escape where you are right now and go to Malaysia for a vacation.
[28:44.85]Right?
[28:46.73]Uh-oh.
[28:51.37]I don't know.
[28:53.25]I don't know.
[28:53.95]That could be, that could just be like an ad to like go visit Malaysia.
[28:59.30]Oh, shit.
[29:00.12]Uh-oh.
[29:04.40]I don't know.
[29:04.90]Alright, I think we're gonna get a big reveal coming up here.
[29:18.77]I'm not looking at you.
[29:20.79]What does that say?
[29:32.10]SG.
[29:33.48]SG.
[29:35.58]What's SG around here?
[29:37.50]Singapore would be SP.
[29:38.78]SG?
[29:38.90]SP.
[29:46.50]Wait, no, it wouldn't.
[29:47.68]S... Sing... This is Singapore.
[29:51.44]Where?
[29:52.80]Wait, Singapore!
[29:53.66]It's in Malaysia!
[29:54.94]Wait, no, it's not.
[29:55.76]What?
[29:57.54]Oh, shit.
[29:59.37]No, it's not.
[30:00.01]It's not.
[30:00.43]It's not.
[30:00.75]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[30:01.91]No, it said visit Malaysia.
[30:03.95]Singapore is Singapore.
[30:04.91]It's different.
[30:07.51]Oh, they confused me with a huge text on the screen.
[30:09.99]They confused me.
[30:11.03]It's here somewhere.
[30:11.76]Where is it?
[30:16.58]I'm gonna keep going.
[30:18.45]SG, that's Singapore.
[30:25.31]Somebody I caught in chat earlier said South Africa.
[30:29.25]No.
[30:30.35]SG, that would be South Gafrica.
[30:32.05]No, that's not what this is.
[30:33.47]This is Singapore.
[30:38.13]Mandarin Hotel.
[30:43.92]Going to meeting, getting to meetings is faster.
[30:52.69]What's that?
[30:53.87]It's Singapore.
[30:54.59]Alright, I'm going for it.
[30:56.19]We're done.
[31:00.97]No, is it like Malaysia?
[31:02.73]Because it's like a visit.
[31:03.59]I don't know.
[31:04.57]Wait, what was that?
[31:05.15]That truck had something on it.
[31:06.01]Where's that truck?
[31:14.40]Where's that truck?
[31:15.00]Where's the truck?
[31:18.68]What happened?
[31:19.66]What happened?
[31:23.98]Oh, God, it disappeared.
[31:25.92]I missed my, like, quest opportunity.
[31:28.58]Alright, I'm going for it.
[31:29.44]I'm gonna say we're, like, probably in, like, a downtown area.
[31:35.27]Wait, one last little check here.
[31:36.67]What's this say?
[31:43.69]Land transport authority.
[31:45.21]Okay, I'm gonna say that means it's probably, like, a land transport.
[31:48.13]It's probably, like, down here.
[31:51.50]I'm gonna say it's like here.
[31:55.14]Let's go for it.
[31:56.04]Bingo.
[31:56.96]Done.
[31:59.58]And that was very, very close.
[32:04.60]They almost got me with the Malaysia ad.
[32:07.16]I was like, oh shit, but does it mean go?
[32:08.42]Does it mean, I don't know.
[32:12.25]Alright, let's go.
[32:16.81]Snow.
[32:17.09]Snow.
[32:19.07]Snow.
[32:21.04]Right off the bat.
[32:25.16]This actually could be... This could be New England.
[32:30.97]You thought they were gonna fucking get us with that one.
[32:33.45]Oh yeah, you forgot to clean up the snow, GeoGuessr.
[32:37.27]Oh, forgot to clean the snow up.
[32:38.63]Yeah, sorry.
[32:39.54]I caught it.
[32:43.98]They could hide it.
[32:44.68]They could like melt all of it everywhere else.
[32:46.40]No, you didn't catch that part.
[32:49.60]What's that?
[32:51.31]I think that's like a... Is that like a state flag or something?
[32:53.75]I don't know.
[32:56.85]Is it a bird or is it a moose?
[32:58.47]It looks like a bird.
[32:59.65]Alright, who has a state bird?
[33:03.93]Every state has a state bird.
[33:05.19]Who has a... Who has a state bird that looks like that?
[33:11.19]Who has a state bird?
[33:13.64]This is... Yeah, look at these homes.
[33:17.32]This is definitely... This is like... This is like New Hampshire or something.
[33:24.94]Oh, absolutely.
[33:25.48]This is like New Hampshire.
[33:26.18]Or like Vermont or something.
[33:28.24]Let's go out this way.
[33:41.77]Gotta get to a main road here.
[33:44.41]And this is how I know it's probably New England.
[33:48.23]Because, like, good luck finding the main road.
[33:51.59]Because, like, there's a shitload of these neighborhoods that just lead into each other.
[34:00.92]This is New England.
[34:01.70]Yep.
[34:02.12]Absolutely.
[34:02.98]I'm convinced.
[34:06.52]Yeah, this is definitely New England.
[34:07.54]I thought a driveway was a road.
[34:08.92]This is New England.
[34:16.61]Oh, yeah.
[34:17.01]I'm convinced.
[34:18.31]Get me to a main road, and I'll confirm it.
[34:26.29]Yeah.
[34:26.65]Oh, yeah.
[34:27.21]Without a doubt in my mind.
[34:30.76]You know why I know this is New England?
[34:33.70]Easy fucking answer.
[34:35.54]This snow was probably here.
[34:38.44]Let's say that this photo was taken in like March.
[34:42.74]That snow probably snowed in February.
[34:46.65]Or like January.
[34:49.55]And it's still there.
[34:52.09]I'm going for it.
[34:53.03]I don't think I need to see anything else.
[34:56.63]And I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go like right on the border here.
[34:59.31]I'm gonna say like
[35:01.74]I'm gonna say, like, Western Mass up into, like, kind of the, uh, like, the New Hampshire potential, like, Vermont area.
[35:06.40]We're gonna go right here.
[35:07.04]Get the fuck out of here.
[35:10.62]You don't think I know my own place?
[35:12.72]You don't think I know my own country?
[35:17.71]Are you shitting me?
[35:18.39]You don't think I know what I'm doing?
[35:21.41]It was, it was closer to Boston, but still.
[35:27.41]That's up, that's up in Newton.
[35:31.65]Yeah.
[35:33.27]Come on.
[35:36.68]That was an absolute giveaway.
[35:38.02]That was a giveaway.
[35:42.00]Let's do it again.
[35:42.46]This is fun.
[35:45.89]I could have said closer to Boston, but I figured it was a little bit further out.
[35:50.09]Closer to New Hampshire.
[35:52.81]Let's do it again.
[35:55.83]Are there sound effects?
[35:56.63]How come I don't hear anything?
[35:58.64]Alright, this is...
[36:02.56]Razer King.
[36:06.77]Where even are we?
[36:07.37]I have no idea.
[36:13.27]Pharmacy.
[36:19.47]Butchery.
[36:20.17]Fast foods.
[36:23.31]It's like a little, this is a market.
[36:25.74]Alright, I think I've got an idea.
[36:29.30]Get out to a main road here.
[36:30.98]What's that say?
[36:45.52]Wait!
[36:47.24]What's this?
[36:48.48]It's definitely not over here.
[37:00.96]It's definitely down here.
[37:04.72]But where?
[37:14.40]Forward travelers.
[37:19.10]What is this?
[37:23.84]Good times.
[37:24.46]Good times.
[37:26.49]Jackpot.
[37:28.71]Jackpot on the top of the truck?
[37:32.49]Wait.
[37:33.51]There's a chemist.
[37:37.19]Pharmaceuticals.
[37:37.75]Chemistry.
[37:38.23]Chemistry.
[37:43.99]I love the word chemist, by the way.
[37:47.83]Where are we, though?
[37:59.18]Breakthrough Summit 2018.
[37:59.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[38:03.64]What's that say?
[38:10.95]In 21 days.
[38:11.47]I can't read that.
[38:15.15]Yeah.
[38:16.73]Rwanda.
[38:18.77]I don't know where that is.
[38:19.41]Are you sure it's Rwanda?
[38:25.69]Hold on.
[38:30.41]Hold on.
[38:30.63]I gotta go back to the chemist.
[38:33.87]You're reading chat.
[38:35.04]No, I'm not!
[38:36.42]I have to read chat.
[38:37.66]Sometimes.
[38:40.76]I don't know where Rwanda is.
[38:44.34]Where is... I don't know where that is.
[38:53.38]You're an ignorant streamer.
[38:54.96]I don't know where Rwanda is.
[38:56.72]I don't know.
[39:00.66]Central... I don't... I know it's like... Oh, shit.
[39:05.38]There it is.
[39:06.46]Thanks, chat, for shit.
[39:10.35]Right here.
[39:10.81]Let's go.
[39:13.27]You didn't even have it correct!
[39:14.37]You guys got it wrong!
[39:15.33]I love chemist.
[39:26.31]Billy Hills.
[39:28.21]Oh, that's not- I thought that was like a sign of where we were.
[39:30.35]Vote for Billy Hillis.
[39:34.99]But where?
[39:41.08]What state or county?
[39:48.00]That's Billy Hillis.
[39:50.26]Okay.
[39:52.71]That's either somewhere in the UK or a GTA NPC character that you do missions for that like has a tractor.
[40:05.34]And, like, at some point during the story, like, drives the tractor through, like, a store to save you.
[40:12.48]And you have to get in the tractor and, like, drive the tractor and, like, avoid the police and stuff.
[40:24.87]So, it could be either one.
[40:28.29]Classic tractor NPC joke.
[40:30.95]Alright, where are we?
[40:37.97]This is definitely... Is it one house?
[40:45.59]How do you get your trash out here?
[40:49.71]This is like a hundred miles away from your driveway.
[40:56.42]Can you imagine lying on the couch with no pants on?
[41:02.70]Just being like, I gotta take the trash out.
[41:06.75]You gotta go for a fucking walk.
[41:11.85]That sucks.
[41:13.83]That's so much.
[41:14.85]That's too much.
[41:20.64]With that kind of house you just have a maid.
[41:22.22]I don't know.
[41:26.44]You have to get a golf cart.
[41:27.74]A trash golf cart.
[41:30.57]Somebody said that's not that far?
[41:43.58]This is far.
[41:46.28]This is a far way to go.
[41:49.06]To bring a bag of trash here.
[41:54.48]That's far.
[41:58.84]Yeah.
[41:59.68]I don't know about that.
[42:00.70]That's like you look out this window.
[42:04.84]And even getting the barrel too, right?
[42:06.86]Like when you know you gotta go get the barrel.
[42:09.28]You just look out this window staring.
[42:11.18]Just going...
[42:14.61]I'll get it tomorrow.
[42:17.49]And then tomorrow, you look out there again and you go... I'll get it tomorrow.
[42:22.73]You will drive by this barrel.
[42:26.48]You will pull into your driveway and you'll look out the window and you'll go... Fuck.
[42:32.42]And you'll just keep going.
[42:39.36]Barrel?
[42:39.60]What do you mean barrel?
[42:40.34]Barrel.
[42:40.70]Barrel.
[42:42.45]Trash barrel?
[42:43.57]I call it a barrel.
[42:44.45]Trash can.
[42:45.03]I call it a barrel.
[42:45.79]I'm from a different part of the world than you.
[42:47.23]Sorry.
[42:48.95]Sorry.
[42:49.31]I'm from a different part of the country than you.
[42:51.51]I'm not in the same country that you're in.
[42:54.15]I call it a barrel.
[42:54.93]It's a barrel.
[42:55.73]Sorry.
[42:56.01]We have different ways of talking.
[43:01.86]Donkey Kong trash can.
[43:03.06]It's a barrel.
[43:03.98]Whatever.
[43:04.36]Whatever.
[43:07.04]I'm not going to take a sip out of this just because you said that.
[43:13.06]A barrel.
[43:14.32]Okay, you want to... Okay, what do you call the thing that changes the channel on your television?
[43:22.58]We have to talk about this every six months.
[43:26.22]Changer.
[43:27.41]I call it a changer.
[43:28.19]A remote.
[43:28.95]When I was younger, we called it a changer beeper.
[43:32.33]It was just the changer beeper.
[43:35.56]And that was cute and fun and whatever.
[43:37.18]Sorry, we talked differently.
[43:40.18]Clicker.
[43:41.16]No, sorry, you don't say it right.
[43:43.39]It's the remote control, TM.
[43:46.83]You say clicker?
[43:48.03]You say changer?
[43:49.85]Sorry, you got it wrong.
[43:50.81]I don't know why you did that.
[43:58.82]Alright, this is definitely... I don't know.
[44:01.30]I'm going to go up here.
[44:06.10]Like here.
[44:06.52]It's probably like the Netherlands or something.
[44:10.49]Or like the UK, I don't know.
[44:12.23]We need a little bit more information.
[44:18.57]Wait, oh, I went backwards.
[44:20.08]I was like, why is every house the same house?
[44:35.36]This cow is just here.
[44:37.00]Alright.
[44:39.56]Wow.
[44:44.32]That's cool.
[44:48.25]I think I'm narrowing down my decision here.
[45:04.18]Not yet.
[45:11.97]This is so beautiful.
[45:15.14]It's so great.
[45:16.32]Okay, I've never been to the UK before.
[45:18.80]Never been to Ireland, never been to Scotland.
[45:21.60]But does anybody else feel like it just smells nice here?
[45:25.80]The air is probably so clean.
[45:29.42]It's probably so fresh.
[45:32.97]What's that say?
[45:33.49]Einstein.
[45:40.99]Einstein.
[45:45.52]Einstein rugs.
[45:46.64]I don't know.
[45:53.27]Wait a minute.
[45:53.83]That's rugby.
[46:16.36]I'm kidding.
[46:18.18]Alright, where are we?
[46:23.32]Ooh, we're gonna get it right off the bat.
[46:25.98]It's gonna be right here.
[46:26.90]Dude, is that a fresh wild apple?
[46:34.01]Are you serious?
[46:35.01]Where is this?
[46:36.43]That's a fresh wild orange.
[46:41.09]Or is that a wild tomato?
[46:43.41]That's a wild tomato.
[46:45.92]A wild onion?
[46:46.64]Holy shit, that's awesome!
[46:49.06]This is wild fruits and vegetables!
[46:57.29]Oh shit, alright, where are we?
[46:58.47]We're, uh, we're in... We're in Asia somewhere.
[47:03.79]I can't get over that wild, like, orange.
[47:06.66]Are they more like wild fruits?
[47:19.95]Okay.
[47:25.09]Okay.
[47:26.95]Okay.
[47:32.67]I don't know where, but we're here somewhere.
[47:36.43]Holy shit, I hope you didn't hear that.
[47:37.66]That was so gross.
[47:38.58]That's the worst noise of the year.
[47:40.02]If it picked up on the mic.
[47:44.12]It was like a bullfrog.
[47:46.06]It was like... Alright.
[47:52.96]Oh my god.
[47:53.72]Can you imagine the amount of wild berries and fruits that are out here?
[47:59.52]Oh my god, this is so... I feel like you live longer if you're in a place like this.
[48:09.99]Like, you're surrounded by, like, agriculture and oxygen, and not, like, Starbucks and tar.
[48:17.75]Don't you think you probably live longer if you live in a place like this?
[48:21.82]Surrounded by wild onion trees.
[48:23.62]It's like a lot of us are surrounded by concrete and lights.
[48:37.02]Imagine if you were surrounded by oxygen and wild berry trees.
[48:50.60]Okay.
[48:51.68]Wait, we got something here.
[48:56.92]Shit, I don't know how to read that.
[49:01.00]What's that?
[49:01.42]That's something dot... Is that dot K-U?
[49:06.41]Dot K-U.
[49:09.27]Something dot K-U.
[49:15.42]Is that a website?
[49:17.70]No, that's not a website.
[49:18.70]I thought it was like some dumb dumb dot like dot com or something.
[49:22.52]I thought that was a website.
[49:23.86]I thought that was a website.
[49:24.88]Alright, that's not a fucking website.
[49:28.97]I thought it was a website.
[49:32.45]Fucking goddamn idiot.
[49:33.69]Alright.
[49:36.13]It's, I'm gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna go here.
[49:40.92]I've narrowed, it's somewhere in this square.
[49:50.15]I'm not pretending, I'm really just like, I don't know, my brain's a little diluted.
[49:55.43]Alright, I'm, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, uh-huh, oh, yep, oh, yeah, yep.
[50:18.41]Hold on.
[50:18.63]Let me get it closer.
[50:19.33]Let me get it closer.
[50:20.00]Yup.
[50:24.50]Yup.
[50:24.70]Okay.
[50:38.92]It's close.
[50:43.30]Ah!
[50:44.01]Ah!
[50:44.13]It's an animal!
[50:44.85]What is that?
[50:45.27]It's like a bat flying into the camera!
[50:56.48]What is that?
[50:59.74]What is happening?
[51:01.85]What is this animal?
[51:02.71]There's like an animal stuck.
[51:06.65]Why is it like flattened on the windshield?
[51:16.03]It's following you.
[51:19.38]Okay, where are we?
[51:20.84]What the hell is happening?
[51:22.58]Is it, wait, is it a leaf?
[51:26.74]Or is there actually like an animal, like a bug on the camera?
[51:33.88]It's changing, whatever it is.
[51:49.36]It's growing.
[51:50.08]Is it a bag?
[51:51.08]I don't know.
[51:54.20]Alright, where are we?
[51:57.91]This looks like, um... I'm seeing sand here.
[52:02.44]It looks sandy.
[52:04.30]The sand.
[52:07.62]Okay.
[52:18.17]Do I have a UPS shirt on?
[52:22.93]This dude is fucking jacked.
[52:28.20]Holy shit, what a Chad.
[52:30.30]This is like a Gigachad.
[52:42.41]I see the American flag.
[52:47.97]So we're in the United States.
[52:51.29]It's desert-y.
[52:55.01]That could be a few places though.
[53:09.66]Alright, this is... This might actually be... Somewhere down here.
[53:17.76]This is potentially like... The kind of... Nevada, Arizona... Potentially like New Mexico.
[53:25.45]I'm thinking New Mexico.
[53:27.53]New Mexico, Arizona, I'm thinking.
[53:30.17]Like somewhere over here.
[53:32.17]I don't think this is Vegas.
[53:33.19]I don't think this is Nevada.
[53:37.33]Although, no...
[53:40.14]No, I don't know.
[53:41.06]It's close.
[53:42.34]It could be.
[53:43.00]It actually could be.
[53:46.00]It could be right here.
[53:46.62]I'm going to say it could be here.
[53:54.55]But we're not done yet because it seems like we're getting to a road here.
[53:57.59]Texas is a lot more green.
[54:04.29]Texas is a lot more green, but there is a lot of green here.
[54:07.81]I'm thinking Arizona or New Mexico.
[54:18.87]Mmm, what's that?
[54:20.73]Welcome to Highland Ranch.
[54:24.81]Wait, why did it just turn into a different fucking season?
[54:28.51]Wait, what?
[54:31.32]What happened?
[54:32.04]What?
[54:41.32]It just turned into a different state.
[54:45.45]It ain't down here.
[54:48.40]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no chance in hell.
[54:52.28]It's up here.
[54:56.66]Where?
[54:59.17]Maybe it is Texas.
[55:03.75]I don't, I don't know.
[55:04.71]This is, this is not Colorado.
[55:07.29]No way.
[55:09.69]This is like somewhere over here.
[55:16.43]I don't think it's this far up.
[55:17.54]No, it's not that.
[55:18.34]It's not North Utah.
[55:19.72]It's Southern Utah.
[55:21.18]In fact, it could be Utah and Nevada.
[55:24.30]Border here.
[55:26.20]Something like down here.
[55:28.18]I don't know.
[55:29.73]It's close.
[55:33.57]Let me keep going.
[55:42.14]Whatever that animal is, it's still here.
[55:47.92]School, hold on, wait.
[55:53.49]Something up here, whatever that is, we're gonna get a look at it.
[55:59.61]What is this?
[56:01.17]School?
[56:06.73]Is this a school?
[56:07.29]Does it have a name?
[56:08.05]What's the name of the school?
[56:10.99]Ah!
[56:13.85]Virginia!
[56:16.11]No, that's, no, Virginia's the name.
[56:18.80]Virginia Palmer.
[56:20.92]Go Palmer, good luck on your tests.
[56:25.40]Wait, this is not, this is not, this is not Virginia, no way.
[56:32.77]No, this app, this is impossible for it to be Virginia.
[56:40.02]Alright, I'm going to make my guess here.
[56:42.71]There's snow, so I'm leaning more towards it not- I'm leaning more towards it being like here.
[56:47.75]Salt Lake gets snow.
[56:50.19]This area, I don't know.
[56:52.05]But when you go up here, you get into like Wyoming and Idaho, and it's not like that.
[56:57.46]I'm gonna- I'm going right here.
[56:59.60]Right here, kind of near the Nevada border, but not quite Nevada.
[57:04.48]I'm going here.
[57:05.90]Right here.
[57:09.52]Fuck, it was Reno!
[57:12.66]Oh, shit.
[57:14.74]That makes sense because right here, a border of California.
[57:20.27]I got to stop thinking about Vegas.
[57:23.85]That right on the border.
[57:24.95]That's right.
[57:25.45]Yeah, Reno does get snow.
[57:28.27]That's alright.
[57:35.86]vedette point new Italy Italy France and uh Italy this is Italy we're in Italy bent yeah Italy done that's speed run right here wait I thought that was the I thought
[58:02.49]I thought that was the Italian flag.
[58:05.35]Does this mean don't... Is that a no entry?
[58:07.65]Or is that a flag?
[58:09.07]Does this mean you can't go in here?
[58:13.12]This looks like a, like, don't enter.
[58:14.86]Wait, what is that?
[58:16.24]That's not... What flag is... That's a flag.
[58:17.86]But for what country?
[58:21.02]I thought it was like, boats don't go this way.
[58:23.22]Is that... That's not French.
[58:26.66]Italian.
[58:27.36]This is... Okay, we're in Europe.
[58:29.59]And we're somewhere over here.
[58:33.00]Somewhere here, I would say.
[58:38.91]Not that far down.
[58:40.15]Somewhere like... I'm gonna sit right here for just a minute because I'm not 100% sure.
[58:52.22]What?
[58:52.78]They got Dippin' Dots!
[58:54.80]They got Dippin' Dots!
[58:55.74]I know where we are now.
[59:01.12]Whoa, these are fucking crazy.
[59:02.46]How come we don't have these?
[59:03.88]What is that?
[59:04.30]I want that one.
[59:06.79]Nouvelle.
[59:08.47]Nouvelle.
[59:09.09]Solero.
[59:12.81]Mojito.
[59:14.31]Extreme.
[59:19.40]I don't think this is Italy.
[59:20.68]I don't think this would be in Italy.
[59:34.09]What is this?
[59:34.89]Wait.
[59:43.28]Switzerland.
[59:44.80]Rado Switzerland.
[59:47.48]This is Switzerland.
[59:53.04]Or maybe it's not.
[59:53.70]It's close to Switzerland though.
[59:59.87]It actually could be like one of these like here.
[60:07.01]I know where, hold on, I know where, I know where Switzerland is, just give me a sec.
[60:20.20]Where the fuck, where is, where is it?
[60:29.70]Where is, where is Switzerland?
[60:37.44]don't have it listed on this one alright it's it's they have a ra they have a Switzerland ad and a french flag that leads me to believe with a little bit of deduction that we are potentially really close to Switzerland in France I'm gonna say we're somewhere here
[61:09.78]I want a little bit more info.
[61:18.49]Cars can drive down here?
[61:20.81]Wait, what?
[61:21.29]Why are there just cars here?
[61:26.63]I thought that person crashed into the wall for a second.
[61:28.67]I was like, why are they crashed?
[61:32.96]You can drive down here?
[61:38.17]I feel like this would be like a... I would be terrified to drive a car here.
[61:42.83]There's like a lot of people.
[61:48.61]You're gonna go up this?
[61:49.53]I don't know.
[61:49.89]That would like freak me out.
[61:52.44]What's that sign say?
[61:53.18]I don't know.
[61:57.78]Alright, so we're in France slash Switzerland.
[62:00.50]I think.
[62:06.50]What's that say?
[62:12.09]Stationnaire.
[62:14.82]I got it.

[77:00.73]I don't know.
[77:01.38]I really don't know.
[77:03.16]I mean, the easy answer here is, what does that mean?
[77:05.54]What's that?
[77:07.60]What is that?
[77:13.17]I don't know.
[77:17.11]Can?
[77:18.81]Wait.
[77:24.32]No.
[77:24.54]No.
[77:30.61]Is it Japan?
[77:35.56]Yasaka, this is, yeah, this is Japan.
[77:41.90]Aware.
[77:45.68]In Japan.
[77:57.97]I'm just putting the names into memory so if I see them.
[78:04.72]Oh!
[78:05.06]Here we are.
[78:06.62]Let's go.
[78:06.94]Koyama.
[78:20.43]Anything that can get me closer, though.
[78:22.21]Because this is a pretty big place.
[78:26.36]I'm not seeing a lot of green.
[78:27.58]I think we're somewhere down in this area.
[78:29.58]I'm going to go right here.
[78:33.31]What?
[78:36.53]Wait, that was Nintendo?
[78:37.75]What do you mean?
[78:38.47]I didn't see Nintendo.
[78:39.47]Where?
[78:39.79]Nintendo HQ?
[78:42.45]What?
[78:45.83]All the signs said Toyama.
[78:47.34]I didn't know that was next to Nintendo.
[78:50.66]I'm pissed now.
[78:58.76]I saw all the signs.
[78:59.40]Toyama, Toyama, Toyama.
[79:00.52]I saw like three of them.
[79:05.42]Okay.
[79:12.29]This is, what are these?
[79:14.19]These are very individually placed.
[79:17.05]Very deliberately spaced out trees.
[79:21.03]This is a farm of some sort?
[79:23.65]What are they growing?
[79:27.25]This is very deliberate.
[79:31.13]These are... berries?
[79:36.48]Wine?
[79:37.88]Wineland?
[79:40.51]If it's wine, then it's either somewhere in Italy, South America, or California.
[79:50.07]This is okay.
[79:50.81]I think we've... Or it could be Spain.
[80:02.26]Solvia.
[80:03.36]Inventa.
[80:09.40]Everything is just Italy.
[80:12.87]Every place is Italy.
[80:13.85]I don't know why.
[80:14.51]It just is.
[80:19.81]Yeah.
[80:20.07]These are wine trees.
[80:29.13]What's up?
[80:32.02]Yeah.
[80:33.00]Okay.
[80:33.26]So these are grapes.
[80:33.82]This is wine.
[80:35.36]What's a part of wine?
[80:36.66]I see a city in the distance.
[80:38.26]That's...
[80:39.77]That's not Los Angeles.
[80:46.64]Is it LA?
[80:47.26]No.
[80:50.02]This is down here somewhere.
[80:52.50]Where's all the wine made?
[81:01.63]Let's just go there.
[81:02.51]I, no.
[81:07.09]Where is that?
[81:07.75]Okay, I'm gonna just go this way.
[81:10.21]Until I can figure out... Alright, we got somebody here on the road.
[81:16.57]What flag is that?
[81:22.12]Relax, it was a joke.
[81:32.88]I've seen, like, motorcycles and...
[81:37.93]That stop sign looks a little sus.
[81:48.36]Doesn't it?
[81:53.14]I'm getting a lot of minus twos.
[81:55.34]I'm just saying that stop sign does not look like a stop sign that I don't think this is America.
[82:03.37]I think we're in South America and we're about to get over to this city and we're going to see what it says.
[82:08.36]Wine country in South America.
[82:10.84]Or wine country in North America, Central America.
[82:15.40]I don't know.
[82:15.92]This could be somewhere here.
[82:20.92]You know what?
[82:26.04]I'm going for probably Argentina.
[82:28.40]That's what I'm thinking.
[82:30.62]I think this is potential Argentina.
[82:36.50]In fact, yeah.
[82:38.61]We're going right here in Argentina.
[82:39.75]Alright, one more, one more, one more, one more.
[82:53.46]Last one.
[82:55.28]One more.
[82:56.06]Maybe one more after that.
[82:56.84]Defensive Ster, like, starts yelling at me.
[83:00.67]Alright, where are we?
[83:04.53]Toe zone.
[83:08.13]Art, art.
[83:11.17]Art, art.
[83:13.03]Art for art.
[83:14.57]Object 19.
[83:16.39]Probebund Stadsoper Probebund Bergtheater.
[83:22.29]But the Bergtheater is over here.
[83:23.93]This is, um... Is this like Sweden, maybe?
[83:32.73]Denmark, Sweden?
[83:33.51]I don't want to look at chat.
[83:36.19]I don't want to give it away.
[83:40.43]Panzer-Hall.
[83:41.71]Haresch... Haresch-Gisch-Liches Museum.
[83:48.97]Wait.
[83:50.39]Is this Germany?
[83:51.69]Is this... Poland?
[83:53.07]No.
[83:54.15]Austria?
[83:55.59]Hungary?
[83:57.69]Slovenia?
[84:01.83]It's not Texas.
[84:06.67]I think this is... Texas!
[84:17.85]This is absolutely Germany.
[84:19.91]But where?
[84:31.04]Object 12.
[84:31.94]Let me get out to like a big street.
[84:48.71]hmm yeah this is it this is definitely Germany we got to find the city though mobilix no oh it's hey that was burg theater the burg theater hamburg
[85:15.11]Austria, okay Alright, I think I've got an idea I'm thinking I'm thinking Greek I'm thinking Greece See Greek lettering Well, we're back we're over here again
[85:51.75]Okay, well, we're... I know where we are.
[85:53.75]I just don't know where... I need specific names.
[86:05.72]This is Japan.
[86:15.96]No, it's not.
[86:19.10]This is not Japan.
[86:21.64]What are these things?
[86:26.59]Is that so you can see over here while you're driving this way?
[86:42.68]Where in Japan?
[86:47.30]This looks a little more country to me.
[86:49.08]Because we're out here with the big mountains, the big... I don't know, this feels a little more country.
[86:53.42]I don't think this is in a major city.
[86:55.38]This is not like Tokyo, or like Kyoto, or... You know, this is... This feels kind of like country.
[87:13.94]What is going on here?
[87:16.78]What is this?
[87:20.98]Is that water?
[87:21.56]This is crazy.
[87:26.77]Okay, that's cool.
[87:28.59]They're making rice?
[87:33.77]Really?
[87:35.57]You just, like, make your own rice?
[87:37.03]I feel- they all live- I feel like you- I feel like, like, if you live in a place like this, you live, like, a fucking hundred plus years.
[87:42.65]Like, I don't have, like, rice behind me.
[87:47.39]I've got, like, rocks and, like, dirt and concrete.
[87:50.25]Like, imagine if I had, like, a fucking whole thing behind me that, like, I could just get my own shit.
[88:02.24]I can't do that, though.
[88:03.02]I would ruin everything.
[88:04.04]It takes a lot to do that.
[88:07.38]You make your own rice.
[88:08.70]You make your own, like, fucking tomato.
[88:10.42]People, I mean, people do that.
[88:11.34]People, like, make their own tomatoes.
[88:13.50]Right?
[88:13.64]I don't know.
[88:15.72]I feel like it's different.
[88:17.60]It's different than you taking a picture of, like, the tomato vine you bought, like, on Instagram.
[88:21.86]Like, this is one of them.
[88:23.32]Like, maybe if you live in, like, the farmland or something, right?
[88:27.52]I'm not talking about, like, the, like, the...
[88:31.31]Fresh tomatoes!
[88:32.43]And there's like three.
[88:33.79]Like, that's not what I'm talking about.
[88:34.75]I'm talking about like you literally live and eat off of like your land.
[88:43.15]Grow your own tomatoes.
[88:47.31]Don't you live in the U.S.?
[88:48.99]I live in the fucking desert, man.
[88:58.86]Alright, I'm saying Japan.
[89:01.85]Grow some agave?
[89:04.00]Yeah, I mean, I could grow agave, but what's that gonna do?
[89:06.92]Like, I'm gonna squeeze that in my coffee?
[89:14.69]Alright, I'm going here.
[89:17.47]Right here.
[89:18.29]Done.
[89:20.87]It's close.
[89:21.43]I knew it was, like, kind of in the country.
[89:23.59]Grow your own weed.
[89:36.44]Okay, this is weird.
[89:39.30]I never... Okay.
[89:41.36]I might... This might be weird.
[89:42.78]Oh, I didn't tell you about my dream!
[89:44.15]Okay, but this is more important.
[89:46.27]So, it's gonna be kind of messy because I don't really... It's hard to piece it together because I woke up and I, like, fell back asleep and woke up.
[89:52.39]I think this is why I have a headache.
[89:54.69]So I had a dream.
[89:55.29]Remember the dream that I had a while back where I was naked on stream and like I went up like this and like my like my you know genital area showed for like a little bit right here and I freaked out and nobody said anything in the chat and I deleted the VOD and shit.
[90:11.14]This was that evolved.
[90:12.42]This was 2.0 that dream.
[90:15.64]So let me see if I can like piece this together.
[90:17.19]I need to take a second.
[90:19.23]In this dream...
[90:21.54]It was a big event stream.
[90:24.30]And it was, like, a ton of people watching, and it was a big event, right?
[90:28.02]Whatever it was.
[90:29.44]And I don't know why, I have no idea why, my brain just decided to do this.
[90:34.04]At some point, like, in the middle of this stream, like, we had to go BRB.
[90:40.27]And, like, I had to change, like, costume.
[90:42.53]I gotta get in my new, I gotta get in a costume.
[90:44.03]Okay, costume change.
[90:45.47]And I don't know why, but, like, when I came back, like, from the BRB, like, at five minutes...
[90:51.33]I was naked.
[90:53.29]Like, naked with a towel.
[90:55.14]Like, with me.
[90:56.76]Like, walking around like I just got out of the shower.
[90:58.86]And, like, maybe I didn't, like, expect that, like, the camera was... I don't know why this was happening.
[91:02.88]Like, I was changing, like, in, like, an area or something.
[91:05.40]And, like, the camera came back and I was, like, on stream.
[91:08.44]And I was like, what the fuck is going on?
[91:09.60]Why am I on... What's happening?
[91:11.20]And, like, I freaked out.
[91:13.30]And, like, the stream ended.
[91:16.04]Right?
[91:17.84]Here's the fucking crazy part.
[91:19.98]Apparently...
[91:22.04]This is like three hours of the stream had been going at this point.
[91:25.67]Apparently, the stream was not pushed to the Twitch servers.
[91:31.35]So we were, this was just broadcasted to nothing.
[91:36.53]So I was like, no way, wait, what?
[91:39.68]So we haven't even been streaming?
[91:42.42]Oh my fucking God, that's so, oh my God, thank God.
[91:46.50]Like, there was a camera problem, I don't know what fucking happened, whatever, right?
[91:49.65]So I was like, wait a minute, so we have, like, the studio recording version of that whole stream.
[91:53.91]And it was like, Community Jake was like, yeah, yeah, we got the whole thing recorded, man, it's all good.
[91:57.85]And I'm like, fucking Jesus.
[91:59.77]I don't know how I, like, walked into frame, I don't know what happened.
[92:02.28]But, like, wait a minute.
[92:04.28]That whole stream was, like, a bunch of money, a bunch of time.
[92:07.48]Why don't we just, like, censor that part?
[92:09.82]And I'll just, like, we'll just do a rebroadcast, right?
[92:12.64]Right?
[92:13.91]Instead of removing the scene entirely, I was like, why don't we just, like, rebroadcast, like, play the video, and, like, just, because it didn't, like, push to Twitch servers or something.
[92:23.99]What the fuck?
[92:25.22]So, instead of removing the whole thing, just cut that part, we had, like, a black sensor bar over me during that part.
[92:35.78]And the worst part about it is when it got to that point...
[92:39.79]Like, I don't know if it was I edited it, I guess, but like, when it got to that part, and like one frame was not moved correctly, and you still saw me naked.
[92:52.38]And I'm being like, what the fuck, man?
[92:54.28]What?
[92:55.14]I'm still naked.
[92:56.42]What happened?
[92:57.48]We're supposed to censor that part.
[92:58.54]Did I miss it?
[93:00.14]And like, everybody freaked out in chat.
[93:03.74]Like I don't know why our brains do this shit.
[93:07.30]Why wouldn't I have just taken that part out of the stream?
[93:11.54]Why wouldn't I have just taken that part out?
[93:13.40]Why did it have to be there with a sensor bar?
[93:18.20]The fact that like it was streamed and like it got caught like holy shit.
[93:22.09]Oh my god.
[93:22.65]Thank God.
[93:23.23]I caught that.
[93:25.23]We could just reupload.
[93:26.47]We could just do like another broadcast, but make sure we censor that part.
[93:33.65]So stupid.
[93:35.37]That was the dream.
[93:39.36]because please keep your dream journal if you don't I know I always say I'm going to but I every time I have a dream I wake up I kind of feel like shit and I go I gotta go back to bed I feel terrible and I put my head down and I fall back asleep you go over the dream like 30 plus times in your brain and then you fall back asleep you wake up an hour or two later and it's gone and maybe a little bit is still there
[94:06.65]Alright, where are we?
[94:08.17]And now I have like a really bad migraine today, so... It's kind of annoying.
[94:14.62]If I have a lucid dream, yes.
[94:16.90]And the thing about a lucid dream is when you start to become aware that you're lucid dreaming, you have to like use magical superpowers to concentrate to keep yourself from trying to get out.
[94:27.64]So you sit there and you go... Wait, don't move.
[94:32.68]You kind of have to not move.
[94:34.62]You have to sit there and just go, don't move, just don't think.
[94:38.08]And just let yourself become lucid without becoming completely lucid.
[94:42.83]Because if you're like, here we go, I'm in the lucid dream, you're out.
[94:49.05]Once you are aware of lucid dreaming, stop.
[94:51.89]And just don't do anything.
[94:54.09]Don't think, don't move.
[94:56.67]Let yourself just solidify into the lucid dream if you want to.
[95:00.39]Because once you're aware of it, it starts to pull you out.
[95:02.27]It's really hard to do.
[95:08.51]You lucid dream, just look at your hands.
[95:10.20]No, I mean, no, no, no.
[95:11.14]Here's the thing.
[95:12.70]If you flick lights, they don't work.
[95:15.06]If you look at a clock, it won't work.
[95:16.72]You can't... Here's the things about dreams that are interesting.
[95:19.47]If you use a light switch in a dream, it will not turn on.
[95:23.03]It won't work.
[95:24.19]That's how you'll be like, wait, what the fuck's happening?
[95:26.40]If you try to read in a dream, you cannot read.
[95:30.32]That part of your brain is not turned on.
[95:32.16]So if you look at a clock or like a piece of text or a book, it's going to be just mess.
[95:40.08]I don't know what that says.
[95:41.24]I can't read that.
[95:42.00]It's nothing.
[95:42.46]It's like alien language.
[95:44.26]If you look in a mirror, be careful.
[95:47.35]Because when you look in a mirror, your brain decides to fill in those blanks because a mirror does not work in a dream.
[95:52.41]So you will see horrifying, twisted shit if you look in a mirror.
[95:57.25]I'm serious.
[95:58.39]Don't be careful when you look in a mirror.
[96:01.12]Because your brain has to pretend that you're actually looking into a mirror.
[96:06.06]And your mouth, your eyes might get big and black.
[96:10.58]And your chin might be shaking.
[96:12.60]It's seriously like a horror movie.
[96:19.13]Oh yeah, it's weird.
[96:23.24]I saw that in a Reddit post too.
[96:30.42]Okay.
[96:31.92]You see, the thing is, I learned all this from... I watched a movie called Waking Life, okay?
[96:37.68]And that movie came out in like 2002.
[96:40.58]So I did not read the Reddit post that you're talking about.
[96:54.59]Oh, I read Reddit too, Jeremy.
[96:56.98]Well, not everybody reads their computer screen.
[96:59.42]Why is he so mad?
[97:01.70]Because I wanted to be the one that gave you that info, not a Reddit post.
[97:05.46]I wanted to be the smart one that you guys go, oh, oh, oh, oh, wow, really?
[97:10.00]And I go, yeah, yeah, I found that out.
[97:13.93]You didn't.
[97:18.85]Hey, you know, let me tell you something else.
[97:20.27]You guys tell me shit all the time that you've, like, read it in Game Informer, okay?
[97:25.44]Like, oh yeah, you didn't know this about this video game?
[97:28.24]Yeah, because you fucking read about it on the IGN review.
[97:31.24]I didn't.
[97:33.94]Everybody gets info from somewhere else.
[97:39.43]Yeah, when you get really mad at me in a week and a half when I don't know where the item is in Elden Ring, you Wikipedia'd it.
[97:45.69]You looked up where the item was.
[97:47.47]You had that info.
[97:55.53]I was close.
[98:03.31]Hmm.
[98:05.35]Alright, I actually go to Pingster.
[98:08.51]Because it's been almost two hours.
[98:09.83]And I told him it was going to be probably like 4.30.
[98:12.60]Liar.
[98:13.44]Lie, Andy.
[98:14.84]Don't ever listen to Jeremy when he ever says anything.
[98:17.98]Always add at least an hour to everything he ever says.
[98:22.10]Um.
[98:25.49]But hey, come on.
[98:26.31]Come on, man.
[98:26.69]Hey, valve time.
[98:29.13]That's how I can hide behind that.
[98:34.67]Yeah, valve time.
[98:36.89]Sooner or later, I'll come up with a Wii U brick that plays Call of Duty in the bathroom.
[98:43.70]Alright, where are we?
[98:56.89]It's not Canada.
[99:02.53]Bicycles expected so la... Okay, it is.
[99:09.02]But Canada is so huge.
[99:15.72]Canada is enormous.
[99:16.99]Like, how can you even know where you even are?
[99:27.43]I see some activity up here, though.
[99:36.00]Real fruit protein smoothies.
[99:39.98]$3.
[99:40.22]At the McCafe.
[99:42.52]What's that?
[99:51.79]I'm going to sneeze, I think.
[99:58.56]St.
[99:58.88]Paul.
[100:02.50]Get that out of the way.
[100:03.16]I can't see.
[100:04.30]St.
[100:04.52]Paul.
[100:05.89]Alright, where's... Where's St.
[100:08.67]Paul?
[100:14.63]Good luck.
[100:22.95]I'm not even going to look because it's like, Canada is like as big as Russia.
[100:26.05]So like, I don't, I'm not going to even guess.
[100:28.37]St.
[100:28.71]Paul, Canada.
[100:35.63]Alpha food.
[100:46.58]Oh, what's that?
[100:48.88]Watson's Pharmacy.
[100:54.40]Pharmacy and Wellness Center.
[101:01.16]Chiropractic.
[101:03.12]Personal Training Center.
[101:06.24]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[101:09.32]No.
[101:10.98]Guardian Overseas Shipping.
[101:12.25]Hacking, Moving, Crating, Shipping.
[101:16.41]Shipping LTD.
[101:17.75]There's another little intersection here.
[101:21.89]What is this?
[101:24.35]Oh, come on.
[101:24.69]That was a real estate sign.
[101:27.45]Come on.
[101:27.81]What's this teleporting bullshit?
[101:28.95]What's it say?
[101:29.33]I don't know.
[101:36.85]Ah.
[101:39.31]Ottawa.
[101:42.20]Where is Ottawa?
[101:49.30]I have no idea.
[101:51.32]Ottawa.
[101:51.56]Ottawa.
[101:54.62]Where's Ottawa?
[101:59.79]Ottawa.
[102:03.39]Ottawa.
[102:03.87]Ottawa.
[102:04.89]Ottawa.
[102:05.61]That's Ontario.
[102:07.27]Ottawa.
[102:12.52]Where's Ottawa?
[102:16.96]Yep.
[102:18.02]Thank you.
[102:19.48]Thank you.
[102:19.84]Yep.
[102:22.75]That was within 1.6 miles, folks.
[102:26.09]Got it.
[102:27.01]Thank you.
[102:32.99]That was 1.6 miles.
[102:33.59]Thank you.
[102:38.86]Don't tell me you think that Greenland is huge.
[102:42.76]I mean, it is kind of huge.
[102:48.22]How can you tell me that this is not huge?
[102:53.44]This is enormous.
[102:59.57]On maps, they make Greenland, like, bigger than the entire, like, North America.
[103:04.19]It's because it's distorted.
[103:13.12]Well, where is it then?
[103:14.04]It's distorted?
[103:15.36]Distorted?
[103:21.84]Look at how big that is.
[103:22.96]This shit's like Northrend.
[103:29.76]Okay, where are we?
[103:34.72]So how big is Greenland?
[103:36.96]Okay.
[103:37.96]If I were to take Greenland and move it over here, on top of Texas, would it be bigger than Texas?
[103:45.56]Or higher?
[103:46.33]Bigger or lower than Texas?
[103:52.11]Yes.
[103:54.13]Actually, yes.
[103:55.21]So Texas is huge.
[103:56.22]What are you talking about?
[103:56.94]Spain.
[104:09.32]Greece.
[104:09.54]Okay.
[104:31.19]Oh, nothing there.
[104:32.25]Okay.
[104:36.37]Wait, wait.
[104:37.53]What's over this way?
[104:38.27]Okay, I see a big Vista here.
[104:46.38]I want to see it.
[104:49.18]Alright, there we are.
[104:49.76]Okay.
[104:54.10]Okay.
[105:01.43]Pena, okay.
[105:02.21]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[105:05.93]I'm thinking somewhere around here.
[105:27.76]Ah!
[105:28.82]Let's go.
[105:35.73]I know, I know.
[105:36.17]Ster, we're done.
[105:36.95]We're done.
[105:37.29]Ster, we're done.
[105:37.67]We're done.
[105:40.01]Alright, I got it.
[105:40.49]I got it.
[105:40.84]It's right here.
[105:44.24]That was really good.
[105:45.44]Really close.
[105:46.36]I mean, not really, but okay.
[105:47.14]Alright!
[105:47.95]Alright!
[105:51.31]It's time.
[105:53.01]Get the camera off.
[105:53.59]I fucking hate this.
[105:55.93]I'm going to ping Ster.
[105:56.61]I'm going to take a quick pee break.
[105:58.63]When I come back, we're going to be playing Dying Light 2 again with Ster for a couple hours, two or three hours, something like that.
[106:06.71]I don't know.
[106:06.99]And I'm going to get this first try right before I go.
[106:09.53]Let's do one more.
[106:10.67]Here we go.
[106:11.77]I'm just going to take literally ten seconds.
[106:13.70]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[106:20.08]6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[106:23.66]What's that say?
[106:24.52]Okay, I got it right here.
[106:27.96]Here we are.
[106:28.52]Missouri, thank you.
[106:29.28]It's fucking Greenland, whatever it was.
[106:33.12]Alright, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.
[106:34.74]We'll be right back.
[106:37.90]I'll see you guys in two minutes or so.
[106:39.53]We're gonna get set up with Dying Light 2.
[106:42.79]I gotta play more GeoGuessr.
[106:43.73]This is a lot of fun.
[106:45.47]I'll be right back.
[107:34.79]Oh, one more round of GeoGuessr.
[107:43.88]So, how are you doing?
[107:47.10]How am I doing?
[107:48.08]Did we get to the... Do you want to keep playing?
[107:53.92]Do you want to keep playing?
[107:56.08]Do you want to keep playing?
[107:57.16]You're bringing up a lot of times like, oh, we're just talking about like sandwiches too much.
[108:03.37]And I'm like, don't want to.
[108:04.31]I have like too much fun when I'm with you.
[108:05.93]And I know my game crashed.
[108:11.25]Do you want to play GeoGuessr?
[108:12.99]Or like a round or two?
[108:15.33]You want to co-op some GeoGuessr?
[108:17.03]I mean, I think there's a co-op mode, but I think you have to like pay for it, though.
[108:22.92]I could just look at your screen.
[108:24.16]You could just look at the screen and like, yeah, let's do that.
[108:27.48]I mean, I'm not going to help because I've only left the U.S.
[108:33.27]like once.
[108:34.73]Don't worry.
[108:36.33]Let me open this up.
[108:44.68]Let's play some GeoGuess.
[108:46.48]Let me explain how this works.
[108:48.65]So GeoGuessr is a game.
[108:51.69]Yeah, I know how it works.
[108:52.95]You tell the people.
[108:53.89]Someone here doesn't know.
[108:54.57]No, no, no.
[108:55.31]They know.
[108:57.17]No, this is a policy that I have.
[108:58.49]It's called No Chatter Left Behind.
[108:59.93]I feel like a lot of streamers will leave someone behind and they'll just be there like, I don't understand.
[109:05.18]What is he looking at?
[109:06.36]And so you have to explicitly every 10 minutes whenever someone asks what's going on is make sure you in detail re-explain what's going on.
[109:13.08]So can we get one good explanation from you, Jeremy?
[109:15.12]No, no, no, no.
[109:16.52]Everybody knows how to play this.
[109:19.05]I just unlocked a razor cannon.
[109:21.87]A two-handed bike razor cannon.
[109:27.79]Wait, you got a cannon?
[109:29.81]Yeah.
[109:32.61]And now it's gone.
[109:33.75]Wait, what?
[109:34.95]Oh, I was looking at something else.
[109:36.57]I'm going to caption my screen.
[109:40.42]I didn't play GeoGuessr.
[109:41.24]It's a game where... Hold on.
[109:48.53]Can you please explain it?
[109:51.89]Why can't I capture it?
[109:55.23]Annoying.
[109:59.37]I might have to restart my OBS.
[110:00.95]This is annoying.
[110:03.31]Don't do that.
[110:03.87]Did OBS crash?
[110:06.26]It actually may have.
[110:07.42]Hold on.
[110:14.74]Black screen Andy.
[110:15.58]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[110:16.72]I don't know what happened.
[110:18.00]Hold on, let me try this.
[110:25.77]What the fuck?
[110:30.25]What the fuck?
[110:36.06]Did I get it?
[110:41.98]Ah, I got it!
[110:45.58]That was weird.
[110:46.06]I had to restart this like three times.
[110:48.06]Alright, I'm going to change my stream title because this is wrong.
[110:53.32]So, as you see... Let's go ahead and get that facecam turned on!
[110:56.25]So, as you see... Wait, am I going to have to see your face?
[111:01.41]You don't have to, but... Okay, so can one of the mods please change it to GeoGuessr?
[111:06.49]You don't change your own stream titles?
[111:08.15]I have to, like, get... I do, but if somebody can do it, it's easy.
[111:12.68]Alright, so as you see on the screen here, you have to decide where we currently are.
[111:17.68]Where are we?
[111:18.74]It could be anywhere in the entire world.
[111:20.74]It's just any place that has been captured by a Google device, right?
[111:24.76]So Google, like, Street View, Google Cars, Google Taxis, Google Bicycles, whatever it is.
[111:34.44]I'm going to do one, and then you can do one, okay?
[111:37.25]Well, we're not going to do it together?
[111:39.13]That would be, like, I want to know how much you know.
[111:41.77]I don't know anything.
[111:42.67]Okay, well, then... I'm not here to impress anyone.
[111:45.53]Then just watch the stream.
[111:46.73]Just turn the stream on and watch.
[111:48.75]Okay, just watch your stream.
[111:50.45]That's what I'm doing now.
[111:51.67]I'm watching Jerma stream.
[111:56.77]Alright, I think this is... I'm seeing some text up here.
[112:00.68]Koditar.
[112:02.02]Koditar.fi.
[112:03.46]I think that might be Finland.
[112:05.34]I think we're in a Finland area here.
[112:06.92]Yeah, I'm just watching.
[112:10.52]Would you say, Ster, that this is Fi?
[112:12.22]Finland makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?
[112:16.61]I mean, that makes sense.
[112:17.43]Okay.
[112:20.35]If we keep going down.
[112:23.89]We're looking for something that would give us an idea of exactly where we could be.
[112:29.94]We're in Finland somewhere.
[112:31.96]But can we narrow down the city?
[112:37.47]How far do you get to travel down the road before the thing is like, hey, come on, man.
[112:42.53]As long as you want.
[112:43.95]There's no time limit unless you set a time limit.
[112:47.58]So there is none.
[112:49.16]Okay, I feel like you should be setting a time limit then because couldn't you just drive around and just ask for directions?
[112:54.74]I mean, yeah, but the whole point is that you don't spend too much time you just wait, zoom in on that license plate.
[113:00.59]Nice.
[113:01.03]They're blurred here.
[113:01.57]Yeah, they're all blurred out.
[113:02.83]You got to find a non blurred one and I'll track it.
[113:05.49]They all license plates are blurred out.
[113:07.51]Like, can we get some?
[113:08.43]Can we get some facial recognition?
[113:10.37]No, those are blurred out too.
[113:11.29]Have you ever used Google Street View before?
[113:13.39]I have but sometimes they might miss one.
[113:15.35]Alright, I'm gonna say this is pretty this is pretty green.
[113:21.21]lush environment.
[113:24.19]How close of a guess, like how close to the city do you consider yourself a winner?
[113:29.09]I would say within five miles, you've won.
[113:33.03]Within five to ten miles, I say that that's a win.
[113:35.37]That's pretty tight.
[113:39.39]But within like 50 miles, I think that you did a good job.
[113:44.67]Okay.
[113:44.77]Alright, we got a bus station here.
[113:45.71]What is it?
[113:49.20]Too blurred out, can't read it.
[113:52.81]4,000 is a good score.
[113:53.45]Yeah.
[113:54.59]That'll get you within probably, like, what?
[113:55.69]50 plus miles?
[113:57.55]There's a lot of bikes.
[113:58.95]100 miles, maybe?
[113:59.43]A lot of motorbikes over to your left.
[114:03.15]There is.
[114:03.49]That's kind of cool.
[114:06.32]Okay.
[114:06.80]I'm going.
[114:07.26]You know where I'm going?
[114:09.16]I'm going Finland.
[114:09.84]I'm seeing a lot of green.
[114:11.68]I think we're going.
[114:12.34]I think we're in Kuvola.
[114:16.84]Just based on nothing?
[114:18.88]That was alright.
[114:19.44]That was alright.
[114:21.28]That's not bad.
[114:22.18]130 miles.
[114:22.52]That's not even good.
[114:23.28]You said within 50 miles was a good job.
[114:26.00]That's 131 miles.
[114:27.04]That's okay.
[114:27.50]That's not bad.
[114:28.76]That's more than double what a good job would be.
[114:32.19]And you're patting yourself on the back.
[114:35.79]By your own definition.
[114:38.05]Lane control.
[114:38.91]This is English.
[114:39.87]Lane control on main road ahead.
[114:41.15]Lane open.
[114:41.73]Lane closed.
[114:43.29]Gizzards?
[114:46.70]Gazzards for decorating?
[114:49.60]Wait.
[114:49.88]I don't know.
[114:52.54]driving on the left side of the road though so I think this is somewhere in Europe it's always Europe goals fabrics okay this to me this looks like England look at this like uh big Ben clock thing that's England see what I mean Helen e bank on the windows
[115:19.37]Under the clock tower and the windows.
[115:21.43]Ooh.
[115:22.07]Okay.
[115:22.31]So this is, this is Helene.
[115:25.62]Antique center.
[115:26.48]Alright.
[115:26.72]So where's Helene?
[115:28.26]That's what we're going to figure out.
[115:32.96]I'm going to go to England.
[115:34.52]Helene.
[115:35.66]I'm saying maybe the London area.
[115:36.76]What do you think?
[115:37.38]Maybe somewhere in London.
[115:40.70]Um, let's keep going somewhere.
[115:44.51]Like,
[115:46.77]America like I've heard of America hearing care this is the driving on the right side of the road we're on the other side of the road it's not America dolphin hand car wash we need to find heleny so many little towns here though it could be any of these poorly
[116:15.49]new romney is it cheating if you just Google heleny yes that is 100 cheating city center alright barnsley is that way at some point we have heleny we have barnsley and where would barnsley be I need a big town
[116:43.80]Like, I need a sign that says, like, London Freeway, that way, or something.
[116:48.99]I feel like you have the city name and the next most adjacent city.
[116:53.63]Like, what more do you need?
[116:55.07]You need to get it right.
[116:55.97]You have to get it on the map.
[116:57.67]Yeah, so, like, shouldn't you be looking on the map rather than around the city?
[117:00.21]Because we already have everything we need.
[117:02.12]But we don't, though, because we're looking for something that can tell us where a major city might be located.
[117:09.00]Like a road sign, or like, oh, over here.
[117:11.08]Okay, Lowfields Park.
[117:14.67]sheffield city council Ster excuse me look at where we are sheffield and that's why you spend a little extra time now we've got sheffield the next step is to look for it's there it's right south of it right here heleny if you zoom in healy that's healy not heleny
[117:36.74]We probably read it wrong.
[117:38.30]Do it.
[117:38.86]Do it.
[117:39.08]Just click it.
[117:39.44]No, no, no.
[117:39.72]That's not right.
[117:40.10]This is co-op.
[117:40.44]Please, please, please.
[117:41.62]It's not going to be right.
[117:42.48]This is Healy.
[117:43.50]Click it, please.
[117:44.62]I'm not going to click it because we could get... We're co-opping.
[117:46.70]We could get like 10,000 points if you get it right.
[117:48.54]You did the first one.
[117:49.50]This one's mine.
[117:50.30]I noticed the first sign.
[117:51.98]I'm in charge.
[117:52.97]Click it.
[117:57.51]Literally, if we spent... Literally, if we spent like five more minutes, we would have found it.
[118:05.35]900 yards and you're complaining.
[118:11.12]but you opened up a Google map what are you talking about didn't you just say why don't you just type in the location and I heard I saw the the name we thought it was wasn't even the name so even if I googled it I'd be looking for heleny not healy alright do you see what's on screen now I see what's on the screen you're just mad because I got like within a like a mile
[118:40.51]Okay, so this is either... This is potentially United States, somewhere like in the middle America.
[118:48.09]This could be somewhere in like Japan or... I need to find a main road.
[118:57.72]I feel like that's cheating.
[119:01.56]No, cheating is typing in Helene into Google.
[119:04.98]It wasn't Helene.
[119:05.90]And then pretending you know where it is.
[119:07.68]Click it, click it.
[119:08.68]Yeah.
[119:10.73]I just tried to wink and both of my eyes bugged out.
[119:16.57]There's a freeze frame in there somewhere that is terrifying.
[119:21.31]Alright, here we go.
[119:21.91]We got a road.
[119:22.37]Where are we going?
[119:22.87]Okay.
[119:31.32]Okay.
[119:33.06]This is potentially somewhere in Asia.
[119:37.14]Get some signs here.
[119:45.48]Okay, I think this is... Let's get over here closer.
[119:49.20]I don't think this is not Japan.
[119:51.78]Is it Japan?
[119:52.26]No, it's not.
[119:52.82]This can't be Japan.
[119:55.76]Is it Japan?
[120:01.31]I've gotten Japan so many times.
[120:03.65]In, like, the five times that I did this in a row.
[120:07.27]Well, everyone... Everyone loves Japan.
[120:10.67]But it's a random place in the world.
[120:13.39]Mm-hmm.
[120:14.73]Okay.
[120:16.95]It is Japan.
[120:18.51]Ask that guy.
[120:19.11]You passed the guy on a bike.
[120:20.49]Ask him.
[120:20.79]Okay, no.
[120:27.87]I don't think so.
[120:31.14]So what sign are you looking for when you can't read the language that will clue you in?
[120:35.74]Because a lot of times the town name will be in English.
[120:41.34]Or at least written out.
[120:45.55]So you just do this forever.
[120:48.46]I mean, it's kind of the point of the game.
[120:51.96]In Japan?
[120:52.56]Yeah.
[120:58.31]Hmm.
[120:59.99]Big solar field out here.
[121:06.21]This is the countryside.
[121:07.31]They're not going to do that.
[121:11.25]They might.
[121:11.75]They might.
[121:12.09]Yeah, they might.
[121:13.78]mean we're just you're on a nice drive right now you guys got to enjoy the journey I guess is what I'm learning yeah it's cool you should play this on stream tomorrow so I can watch I I would be playing with like 30 second timers I hear Jerma likes to go fast I just I'm just I just want to know make sure everybody's aware that like literally this is in English and everyone was think said I was an idiot
[121:39.40]Wildlife Protection Area.
[121:41.89]Showsome Prefecture?
[121:45.33]Wildlife Protection Area, whatever it says, I don't know.
[121:50.57]Yeah.
[121:51.81]You told them.
[121:54.48]Your mic is still compressed?
[121:55.74]No, it's not.
[121:56.94]I think mine is.
[121:58.82]I reset mine and it still sounds like it's messed up, which is why I didn't want to do this joke in the first place, because now we're all the way down here and we're just going to keep doing the joke the whole time.
[122:09.52]I don't want to turn that on right now, but I'm going to.
[122:14.84]Okay.
[122:16.64]So what I think we're going to do here, I think we need to go a little bit further down.
[122:25.78]I think what you need to do to prove that you are a good geoguessr is just open up the map, and we're both going to guess the spot, and whoever's closer wins.
[122:35.19]Fine.
[122:36.07]We've been driving around for a while now.
[122:37.43]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[122:38.71]Where are you going?
[122:41.46]I have to go first.
[122:43.76]If I go first, you'll just see what it is.
[122:45.68]Well, down there by Shikoku.
[122:48.50]That's where I was going to go to.
[122:49.34]Oh, well, then let's zoom in.
[122:51.30]Let's see who gets closer if we're really going to do that.
[122:53.62]Okay.
[122:57.03]That's as far as you can zoom in.
[122:58.39]I mean, I can keep going.
[122:59.17]Do you want southern coast?
[123:02.27]Do you want northern coast?
[123:03.05]What do you want?
[123:10.57]Which one?
[123:13.77]I'm going right here.
[123:18.17]That's a good spot.
[123:19.11]I think you might have it.
[123:20.49]Not even close.
[123:24.88]Alright, so you get it.
[123:28.36]You get the idea.
[123:29.56]I get the idea.
[123:31.56]Rumblefish.

[126:32.93]Up?
[126:37.51]I don't know where Hollywood is.
[126:39.35]I know it's like right here somewhere, isn't it?
[126:43.66]It's not LA.
[126:47.32]Where's Hollywood?
[126:51.04]I don't know.
[126:51.40]Never heard of it.
[126:53.74]Yeah, there it is.
[126:55.10]Okay, but Hollywood... We might be able to get this exact.
[126:59.19]Yeah, but that's a bus, and that bus drives around, and that bus isn't representative of Hollywood.
[127:04.33]That's right.
[127:04.69]This is bait.
[127:07.29]California Silk.

[127:54.85]What?
[127:56.61]What about those emails?
[127:57.43]You're saying it as a joke.
[127:59.91]I don't take kindly to that.
[128:01.37]You make that joke every time we hang out.
[128:03.01]I'm not joking.
[128:04.91]You say that every single time we've ever been in a call.
[128:08.13]So I'm just making fun of you.
[128:10.39]Okay.
[128:12.36]Alright.
[128:12.66]I'm just going to go right here.
[128:13.42]Right here.
[128:19.90]It's not even Hollywood.
[128:21.66]It was downtown LA.
[128:22.86]Yeah, I was going to say, that shit looked like Skid Row.
[128:28.01]Whatever.
[128:31.43]Jerma's never been to that part of LA.
[128:33.23]Forgive him.
[128:36.50]I've been to LA like four times.
[128:38.76]He's only seen it from the top floor of one of the skyscrapers.
[128:47.44]I've been to LA maybe five times my entire life.
[128:52.48]Okay, where are we?
[128:57.92]One of the skyscrapers.
[129:01.30]I'm seeing a lot of... I'm gonna say... I think we're in South America.
[129:11.45]Somewhere like in here.
[129:13.77]That's my gut reaction.
[129:15.89]Wait, Google Maps is... I guess you said they have Google Bikes.
[129:20.19]They're driving around like... Yeah, this is not a car.
[129:24.80]Yeah, that would be weird.
[129:28.14]This is either South America or somewhere in Asia.
[129:30.26]A lot of terrain.
[129:38.74]Looks a lot like...
[129:44.03]What's the name of that place?
[129:46.56]I don't know.
[129:46.90]It could be like Central America.
[129:48.88]It could be.
[129:51.16]Wait, I got a sign.
[129:51.98]What does the sign say?
[129:55.14]Yeah, you're right there.
[130:08.67]What is that?
[130:15.01]don't know what language that is um okay that removes South America for me so then it has to be over here Antarctica no it's not uh I can't go any further oh he's got a guess he's got a GeoGuessr
[130:43.95]Ah, wait.
[130:44.53]I'll go down this road.
[130:46.41]There's something here.
[130:52.56]Ah.
[130:54.38]You can zoom in on that little note.
[130:58.58]What's this?
[131:01.59]I can't wait until the future when you can play this game on, like, a drone.
[131:05.60]And a drone just goes around and annoys people, and you can, like, put money into the game client to, like, annoy people and be like, hey, where is this?
[131:13.38]And you can, like, ask questions.
[131:15.43]And everyone in the world knows the game.
[131:17.79]You were kind of describing, like, tourism in general.
[131:22.73]Like, people go to travel to different places, and they, like, walk around with, like, the books and the maps and shit and, like, ask people stuff.
[131:29.52]Yeah, this is going to be a thing.
[131:30.72]They're going to sell like a drone.
[131:32.54]You activate the GeoGuessr drone and you have to pay money to ask questions to people.
[131:37.37]Alright, I'm going for a guess.
[131:39.63]I'm starting the business.
[131:41.35]I'm going to say it's somewhere in here.
[131:45.12]Let's go with... Put it... I would put my guess right in the middle of the ocean there.
[131:54.48]so that I can get all of those islands and equal distance I'm gonna say hey hey hey hey hey is that the same that's that's the same writing isn't it yeah oh bingo right here let's go right here island I was cheating how is it cheating
[132:22.30]alright so that was cool uh 65 miles you're 15 miles off of being good alright I'm gonna do the challenge to play today's daily do you have what it takes to become a geoguessr master navigator okay start let's start the game maybe maybe not
[132:43.71]You can get Jerma to make a multiplayer room with you since he has GeoGuessr Pro.
[132:50.07]I'm peeing.
[132:50.99]Just entertain the audience for a minute.
[132:52.31]I'm just supposed to sit here and entertain the audience when I have no control over the mouse, the keyboard.
[132:59.62]He's the one with the GeoGuessr Pro and apparently I can play with him.
[133:04.53]And generally speaking... Oh, I'm actually shocked he didn't mute and deafen.
[133:10.29]Because he's usually so scared of what I'm going to say while he's gone.
[133:16.53]But the truth is that... I'm a nice guy.
[133:20.54]I don't say anything weird.
[133:23.24]I mean, like, sometimes I talk about, like... Like, weirder stuff, like Hillary's emails and, like, all the comment and... But those are just, like... It's just life.
[133:36.94]It just all exists.
[133:41.72]Yeah, I don't know.
[133:42.10]Everyone's obsessed with cum these days.
[133:44.52]Talk about furries?
[133:45.62]Well, I don't know.
[133:46.48]Does Jerma chat know about... I feel like I talk about my furry policy so often.
[133:51.16]I'm spreading the word at this point.
[133:54.16]You gotta be a furry now to get the tax credits for when it's a thing in the future and you can check the box for furry.
[134:02.82]But if you don't have evidence now that you were always a furry, you're just gonna look like you were playing along.
[134:09.48]Everyone has to know that by now.
[134:11.02]I've told pretty much everyone.
[134:20.30]What's he saying?
[134:20.70]Is he saying something bad?
[134:22.64]Did he say something bad?
[134:23.40]What did he say?
[134:25.74]I'm giving them, like, legal tax advice.
[134:30.63]Don't do that, please.
[134:31.85]Alright, we have three minutes.
[134:33.37]Here we go.
[134:37.55]Northwestern University.
[134:39.67]That's California right there.
[134:42.05]California.
[134:44.14]Okay, where?
[134:45.92]Probably in the northwest.
[134:48.04]Wait, what the fuck, dude?
[134:50.20]That's California?
[134:51.28]No, it's not.
[134:52.56]It just looked like California.
[134:53.54]It was shaped like California.
[134:57.18]Okay, alright.
[134:57.82]I got two and a half minutes.
[135:04.17]Alright, I'm gonna go over here.
[135:07.66]I think it's in that same kind of area that we were before.
[135:10.68]Like, down here, maybe?
[135:13.12]I'm gonna say... I'm just gonna go for it.
[135:14.32]We only have two minutes.
[135:17.07]I'm gonna say, like, the Philippines, or... Oh, we're timing.
[135:21.75]This is the challenge.
[135:22.53]This is the challenge.
[135:23.39]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[135:24.21]No, it's not.
[135:24.63]No, it's not.
[135:26.07]This is over here.
[135:28.31]This is, like, somewhere over here.
[135:33.54]I think.
[135:34.46]Don't look.
[135:36.32]I'm not looking.
[135:39.92]Alright, I'm gonna say, like, Bangladesh right here.
[135:44.54]Oh my fucking god, I nailed it.
[135:47.52]Next round.
[135:50.88]Okay, good one.
[135:51.66]Yeah, you're doing pretty good.
[135:53.04]They're timed.
[135:53.58]You get more points.
[135:55.86]Okay.
[135:57.88]This one's gonna be hard.
[136:01.10]Oklahoma.
[136:05.92]It could be.
[136:09.70]We gotta go kind of fast down this road, though.
[136:12.59]There's no way.
[136:13.29]You don't have time.
[136:13.89]You need to guess.
[136:15.71]These long roads, you're never gonna see anything.
[136:20.27]Oh my god.
[136:20.87]You're just losing time.
[136:27.98]Shit.
[136:32.02]This is not Oklahoma, man.
[136:33.32]This is way... Oklahoma's not like this.
[136:38.05]Okay.
[136:39.78]What is this like?
[136:40.44]What side of the road are we on?
[136:45.32]We are on the... Right side of the road is driving.
[136:48.12]You can see the car behind you.
[136:49.34]Okay.
[136:51.31]So we... Okay, so where is this though?
[136:58.85]This is anywhere.
[137:00.29]It could be.
[137:01.41]I'm going to say... Damn.
[137:04.78]It's like a cloudy day too, so it's hard to tell.
[137:08.77]um I think this would be further north more like a Montana maybe I could see a Montana Wyoming dakota kind of area let's let's go with Wyoming I'm gonna say right in this kind of area here like here Wyoming let's go
[137:37.89]yo that was not even close I was gonna say some of the trees looked a little yeah u.s but the right side of the road and okay this is uh I think this is european I don't see these signs in America looks like California yeah I think it's California
[138:04.31]Look at these little green things.
[138:06.15]What are these little green containers?
[138:09.31]These are like tiny little recyclings.
[138:12.13]Antenova.
[138:14.69]Are these really small or am I crazy?
[138:16.91]These are tiny.
[138:18.43]Well, Americans have a lot of garbage.
[138:20.72]That's all we have.
[138:22.10]Look at how little these are.
[138:23.10]Okay.
[138:24.18]Yeah, this is like normal size like rubbish for a family.
[138:30.20]Antenova.
[138:30.94]Antenova.
[138:41.22]Antenova.
[138:41.98]There's something going on up here.
[138:45.78]This is somewhere in South America, probably.
[138:53.54]Shit, we're right in the middle of nowhere again.
[138:54.88]This could be the... I thought that was like a dead animal or something.
[139:10.06]This could be the same exact spot.
[139:14.27]This looks pretty much, uh, it's either okay.
[139:18.63]I'm saying down in that same exact area or somewhere in like Europe.
[139:23.71]Like here.
[139:28.50]Any input?
[139:30.26]I have never left my home.
[139:35.73]Alright, well I'm going with like Russia.
[139:38.65]I'm going with, like, here.
[139:39.35]I did hear earlier that you always go with Russia.
[139:42.65]For good reason.
[139:43.69]You think everywhere in Europe is Russia.
[139:46.37]It's, like, Croatia.
[139:48.25]Damn it.
[139:55.41]Okay, this is Asia.
[140:03.27]But where in Asia?
[140:04.63]Let's go, which way, what looks more populated?
[140:08.65]Down here.
[140:13.65]I don't know.
[140:15.71]It's not Japan again.
[140:16.85]Is it Japan again?
[140:18.19]Again?
[140:20.08]I mean, it's been... This is like... So, how rare would this be to have Japan like... Anywhere in the world.
[140:31.00]And I've gotten Japan like seven times.
[140:35.57]Okay, here we are.
[140:38.18]That's a nice hill.
[140:39.76]I'm liking this tree hill.
[140:41.70]Japan is fucking beautiful.
[140:43.32]You got names.
[140:43.88]Naroshi and Suzu.
[140:45.68]Naroshi.
[140:46.90]Suzu is closer.
[140:47.76]15 kilometers.
[140:50.72]Suzu is closer.
[140:53.86]Oh, no.
[140:55.36]Was it Naroshi?
[140:59.85]I got 1 minute and 52 seconds to find it.
[141:08.27]This could be big points here.
[141:10.25]Naroshi or Suzu.
[141:11.67]Naroshi or Suzu.
[141:12.75]Come on.
[141:20.46]No.

[142:19.46]Shit.
[142:20.34]Yeah, also you could look for 249 highway.
[142:23.64]249.
[142:26.42]25 seconds.
[142:33.18]There's so many numbers on the screen.
[142:34.35]Good luck.
[142:34.65]15 seconds.
[142:43.62]Yeah, this is a fake image from, uh, this place isn't real.
[142:52.15]Ah!
[142:54.03]Is it Africa?
[142:55.33]Wait.
[143:00.85]This is where I clicked?
[143:03.57]You must not have clicked in time or something.
[143:07.42]Because that's, I'm pretty sure that's like 0, 0 longitude, latitude.
[143:10.72]Yeah, fuck.
[143:14.12]God damn it.
[143:16.01]You just scared my cat.
[143:17.01]I'm sorry.

[149:37.50]I didn't know how the game worked.
[149:38.54]Ten seconds.
[149:39.06]No one explained it to me.

[150:21.96]Get out of here.
[150:22.42]Leave.
[150:28.08]What?
[150:28.98]How would you... I'm going with the make-you-have-to-guess-within-30-seconds strat that I was hit with.
[150:41.57]I might be way off.
[150:51.39]Oh!
[150:52.15]I was in the right continent!
[150:53.94]Wasn't.
[150:57.92]South Africa?
[150:59.76]Yeah, I've seen a lot of fences like that in South Africa.
[151:02.34]It was a rambunctious guess.
[151:08.33]Very, very green.
[151:09.15]Oh, this is a repeat.
[151:14.29]I actually did this one in Greece.
[151:18.21]How do they have repeats when it's the whole world?
[151:20.22]It's a fucking repeat.
[151:21.26]Sometimes it does it.
[151:27.97]Are you fucking with me or are we clicking Greece?
[151:30.33]Nah, I'm just saying.
[151:32.39]What do you mean you're just saying?
[151:36.49]I'm just messing around.
[151:37.71]Sometimes it happens.
[151:41.66]He's trying to throw me off.
[151:47.20]Look in their windows.
[151:57.05]Where is it?
[151:58.15]I just don't know where it is.
[152:01.65]Okay, fine.
[152:02.31]I didn't even notice that you gasped.
[152:09.64]It's okay.
[152:15.10]I beat you on that because I clicked Greece because you said Greece.
[152:19.38]I thought it was Sweden.
[152:25.09]I don't know why.
[152:47.65]this is like really dramatic wait that's hit him with the timer I'm thinking of hitting you with a timer I thought that I'm so stupid
[153:40.30]I'm going to hit you with the timer.
[153:41.12]In a minute here.
[153:43.82]Oh, you want to do it to me?
[153:44.92]That's fine.
[153:50.75]Who's closer?
[153:54.39]By a tiny bit.
[153:55.71]You were a little bit, yeah.
[153:58.56]I thought it was Munich because I saw a sign.
[154:01.66]Wait, what the fuck is... What did that say?
[154:04.76]I thought that said it was healing me less.
[154:47.08]Really?
[154:47.40]Really?
[154:51.44]We just got to full health.
[154:54.56]Double damage on this one, okay.
[154:56.53]Oh shit.
[155:34.72]I should have taken an extra 30 seconds tripled yeah you could win I could win with this triple damage of these bushes
[156:29.32]10 seconds, dude.
[156:30.08]Come on.
[156:39.09]How did you even know that?
[156:42.43]How did you even know that?
[156:43.50]Because, see, I had previous knowledge from hump ahead.
[156:45.92]How did you know that?
[156:48.38]Just looking around.
[156:49.18]There's a lot of clues in the environment.
[157:02.45]Also, how many of these have you done before?
[157:04.15]That feels kind of fucked up.
[157:06.11]I've done this like five times total.
[157:08.52]Yeah, but if you keep getting the same ones like twice, you said you've already gotten these.
[157:12.60]I mean, it's likely you're going to get similar in the same country more than once.
[157:16.24]There is a whole world.
[157:18.36]What do you mean I got this one before?
[157:20.44]I was actually fucking with you when the Greece thing came up.
[157:26.43]I made it up.
[157:28.05]I don't think you're making it up.
[157:39.33]yeah I don't he's yeah he's reading chat I'm not reading chat yeah I'm gonna go back and look at your eyes

[158:29.19]I'm just gonna go for it.
[158:29.87]I'm going for it.
[158:30.71]Yeah, I feel like I just need to click something.
[158:50.37]God damn it.
[158:50.99]Are you seriously that much closer than me?
[158:53.56]Got him.
[158:54.24]Triple damage.

[160:49.76]Last one.
[160:51.86]In the barrel.
[160:53.02]Why California?
[160:53.68]Because it's the first place I could click in half a second.
[161:12.30]I don't know, man.
[161:16.96]What the fuck?
[161:21.50]I don't, I actually, I don't, I have no idea.
[161:27.20]Why would you put that pressure on me?
[161:32.80]Because I'm trying, I'm trying to do the pressure.
[161:35.34]I'm trying to put the heat on.
[161:51.94]really I'm just trying I'm just you know uh um I don't know I'm kind of banking on you not clicking anything or apparently just like accidentally consistently like getting a little bit closer I knew that was like somewhere up in kind of the european area yeah 15 seconds is too much I'm giving them too much time
[162:17.39]Thought I knew but now I don't
[162:46.70]You know, any moment I could be clicking.
[162:48.32]You could, any moment, yeah.
[162:53.36]I don't think you're prepared.
[162:54.90]I don't think you are either.
[162:55.64]I don't think you're ready for this.
[163:06.73]I don't think you can handle this.
[163:09.43]I know exactly where we are.
[163:11.59]I don't think you know.
[163:20.62]I've been down this dirt path many times.
[163:22.54]So how come you haven't clicked if you know where we are?
[163:27.61]You're so confident.
[163:28.67]I'm definitely more certain now.
[163:59.29]Can I change my answer?
[164:11.08]I would have beat you.
[164:11.98]Honestly, if I could have changed my answer, I would have beat you in one turn.
[164:19.02]What made you change your mind after you clicked?
[164:22.72]Just the language.
[164:32.11]Oh this is Greece... okay might as well just want to stop now, this is Greece.
[164:47.00]Yeah that's Greece right there.
[164:49.00]So I would- so click Greece, if you're so confident.
[164:59.16]That's gonna be a grief.
[165:08.62]It's so residential, it's so hard to tell.
[165:45.51]Oh, so you heal from this one.
[165:47.71]You don't like damage the other person.
[165:49.31]This is just a healing round.
[165:52.27]I am understanding.
[165:53.63]I get it.
[165:54.49]I see.
[166:05.72]Give me something to fucking work with and not like city skyline signs.
[166:16.42]What is that supposed to mean?
[167:03.19]I don't know.
[167:03.77]I don't know, man.
[167:04.83]I don't know.
[167:05.35]I saw that sign.
[167:07.28]I can't do flags.
[167:15.94]Ooh.
[167:17.55]Kind of nice houses here.
[167:18.51]A little techy, a little modern.
[167:33.23]Got a little bit of information right there.
[167:35.65]Like, when there's pressure, I can't do anything.
[167:39.97]What do you mean?
[167:41.27]Like, when I'm up against, like, somebody else.
[167:42.67]If I could just sit here with my fingers up my nose, I'd be fine.
[167:48.66]Just guess.
[167:49.20]Just guess.
[167:49.44]What do you mean, just guess?
[167:51.08]Just 10 seconds.
[167:51.84]Like, all that matters is whether or not you win or you lose.
[167:53.60]You can't do that.
[167:53.96]I don't know.
[167:54.38]I'm going to stay right here somewhere.
[167:59.58]Oh, it's CA, not California.
[168:01.31]Canada.
[168:12.70]But if I had a few seconds to think that through I wouldn't have clicked that But it's not always you know in life you don't always have as much time as you want I know but like it if I had with my brain was not in like dreamland and like the music It's like who wants to be a millionaire like hurry up music
[168:48.93]Yeah, this one's definitely great.
[168:50.80]I know that for sure.
[169:55.44]Come on.
[169:58.84]Damn.
[170:01.16]Spain?
[170:01.60]What do you mean, Spain?
[170:02.40]Oh, dude, I've been here before.
[170:06.57]Yeah, this is Greece.
[170:12.95]Stop saying Greece.
[170:15.15]You started it.
[170:16.19]Yeah, I started it and you just won't let it end.
[170:44.98]Dude, I'm... I'm... This one is... I'm brain dead.
[170:50.46]Where the fuck is that?
[170:51.28]Hold on.
[170:51.81]I unplugged my thing.
[170:54.23]It doesn't look like that at all.
[171:48.48]If we're going to guess this, I feel like I have a decent idea.
[171:51.70]I'm slowing down.
[171:52.44]I'm trying to figure it out.
[171:53.06]I'm slowing it down a little.
[171:54.38]I don't know where it is.
[172:12.68]This is totally greasy.
[172:25.72]This is for four times damage, dude.
[172:28.42]Oh, I'm gonna kill you.
[172:30.68]It's all gonna be over if you... You might.
[172:53.69]Where the fuck is that...
[173:08.62]Yeah, I don't actually know where it is.
[173:15.92]I could just get you right now.
[173:20.15]Oh, fuck.
[173:20.85]Come on, dude.
[173:21.39]Really?
[173:21.65]I don't know.
[173:30.93]I don't know.
[173:38.82]You're looking a little dead here.
[173:40.11]California.
[173:51.70]I was looking at every- I saw the Mariana islands and I was looking at every- I checked the islands over there and I fast and I just like there's so many islands off of California.
[174:00.00]It starts it's not like this passport center and these trees are so not-
[174:03.00]I know but it's like office of the secretary like Commonwealth of the northern- that sounds like that sounds American to me.
[174:09.00]Yeah it is. I think it's like it's a U.S. territory somewhere in the fucking ocean out there.
[174:14.00]So I just clicked in the ocean.
[174:16.00]Alright actual last one. One more.
[174:18.00]Okay, actual last one.
[174:27.12]It is American. I know but like I thought it was gonna be like right there.
[174:31.12]Yeah we don't we don't let anyone be independent despite all of our independence.
[174:36.12]Alright let's do it.
[174:38.12]Fuck that. Alright one. Let's go.
[174:43.12]You're gonna get three zeroed so bad.
[174:47.12]I've been here before.
[174:49.32]Yeah, but like, okay, so Ster has never played this before, but you never know when you unlock a new game that you're actually really good at and you never knew it.
[174:57.13]I'm not very good at GeoGuessr, so he could be actually pretty good at it.
[175:00.45]And he's like finding a new thing that he's actually really good at and he could like just play and stream it and stuff.
[175:06.79]I always have problems with languages.
[175:10.90]I think as an artiste, I pick up on a lot of like tiny little...
[175:18.84]like, artistic, like, architecture details that I've seen before.
[175:23.52]What am I looking at?
[175:24.88]What the fuck am I looking at?
[175:29.02]I have no fucking clue where this one would be.
[175:31.66]For real?
[176:01.08]It didn't count my click, did it?
[176:02.78]Where were you clicking?
[176:03.84]It didn't count my click.
[176:05.28]I was so close to that.
[176:06.74]Why was there Russian and English?
[176:08.89]Oh, man.
[176:11.51]I saw a sign.
[176:12.17]It was English, Russian, and then, um, like, um, Malaysian, whatever it was.
[176:17.35]I saw a lot of weird shit.
[176:19.08]I was thinking Madagascar for a second.
[176:21.06]I was way too zoomed out to take what I thought was the safer guess.
[176:31.24]There's a lot of places, like, uh, only one place I've been.
[176:33.78]Where did me and Ashley go?
[176:35.68]Um, Cayman Islands.
[176:38.33]They remind me a lot of that, where everything is made for Americans to tourism there.
[177:16.32]uh wow we were both whale why was there a french flag it was like a french flag right there yeah street names were french I just like I was like I'm okay french what is even the name of this language there's so many different languages it's so hard to
[178:01.51]Um, I have no idea.
[178:10.92]It looks like the one ring language.
[178:27.27]yeah the ring was engraved with uh the elvish it's elvish gonna get scammed
[178:55.69]Oh my god, give me a break.
[178:57.27]Give you a break?
[179:02.05]You're the one that guessed.
[179:03.01]But there were two... How did you know I guessed?
[179:06.82]Because it gave me 15 seconds.
[179:08.98]But how do you know that was a guess?
[179:10.46]I didn't know that was a literal guess.
[179:12.72]I mean, we're a geo-guesser is what I'm saying here.
[179:16.70]So you didn't look at my camera and see my hands go up and do that?
[179:19.42]I'm not looking at your camera.
[179:21.58]Dude, they have the fucking longitude here.
[179:45.33]I'm wrong.
[179:45.77]I'm racist.
[179:53.61]I think I saw somebody's dick.
[179:54.53]What was that?
[179:55.45]What was that?
[179:55.99]That was weird.
[179:56.47]What's going on?
[180:02.31]What was that?
[180:02.81]I couldn't even click.
[180:06.87]I was dumbfounded.
[180:09.15]What do you mean?
[180:10.13]It said, like, peep show, and there was a guy sitting on a chair.
[180:12.71]It freaked me out.
[180:17.78]Okay, well, you can heal up this round.
[180:19.05]You don't have to see any dicks.
[180:21.19]It literally is like, oh, here comes the peep show, and there was a guy, like, sitting down like this.
[180:53.93]Yeah, this one's Greeced.
[180:55.13]It could be any of these.
[181:07.46]It's crazy how many we've done in a row and they've all been Greeced.
[182:23.87]We had the same idea, but whatever.
[182:28.24]Yeah.
[182:29.29]I mean, you healed.
[182:30.35]I did a little, yeah.
[182:31.55]You got a little bit of heal.
[182:32.19]Double damage.
[183:15.52]That is actually almost exactly where I was clicking.
[183:26.07]I saw this thing that was like an ad for like the Mediterranean.
[183:29.39]I can't lose like that.
[183:30.39]That's fucking lame.
[183:31.99]Really?
[183:33.05]I was seriously was almost exactly where that was.
[183:42.78]And then you lose the whole thing.
[183:44.64]Oh, yeah.
[183:45.42]That was bad.
[183:45.98]I just had been holding a two-handed sword over my head, just queuing it up, charging it, and let it go and it killed you.
[183:58.48]Like an hour.
[183:58.98]I'm destroying you for that.
[184:03.38]This is the most powerful I've ever been.
[184:06.92]Oh, you fucking slimy little dirtbag.
[184:13.18]Where are you?
[184:13.94]Where are you?
[184:20.55]Wait, that's not France.
[184:21.49]Oh, shit.
[184:22.07]Wrong flag.
[184:24.83]There were Russian letters everywhere.
[184:26.89]That's the wrong flag.
[184:29.21]Yeah.
[184:35.97]I know I say this often, but as a well-traveled man, I'm pretty sure I've been here before.
[184:43.90]I stayed in this island.
[184:47.25]Coca-Cola.
[184:48.27]That's actually a big clue.
[185:26.55]ah don't do it to me again oh I was closer what's that aloha is that guam again I keep doing this exaggerated like annoying hog face I'm probably pissing off so many people they don't know it's exaggerated
[186:08.83]I don't know where it is.
[186:10.33]There it is.
[186:11.81]I think I fucked up.
[186:14.67]Damn.
[186:16.79]That was not bad for guessing within five seconds.
[186:26.37]I'm with Skwetaun, Norway.
[186:28.84]How did you guess that close?
[186:29.98]God damn.
[186:30.54]Because I saw NL.
[186:33.58]I didn't see anything.
[186:36.14]I saw like one word and I was like, ah, somewhere around here.
[186:40.66]Why did I go this way?
[186:42.96]What is wrong with me?
[186:43.93]I was distracted by my own talk.
[186:47.57]This could be a lot of different places, unfortunately.
[186:53.61]I have a feeling, actually.
[186:56.43]You actually?
[186:56.93]I don't know how.
[186:59.29]I feel like you are not going to be able to...
[187:02.78]I actually feel like I have a weird kind of wild guess here.
[187:06.15]It's not that wild.
[187:07.77]So I think I'm just going to go for it and see if I can screw you over.
[187:18.01]Right, okay.
[187:20.54]It's always Greece.
[187:25.84]Healing round.
[187:27.94]Oh dude, wild onion trees.
[187:49.56]Really?
[187:49.90]Are you serious?
[187:57.02]This one's great.
[188:05.27]You just clicked a random place in the middle of Russia.
[188:09.71]I'm not going to get a bigger clue by spending more time.
[188:17.26]I know my limits.
[188:24.93]road in the middle of nowhere it's gonna be hard I feel like it shouldn't be yeah with uh I don't want to say it dude
[189:01.32]I had a little bit more time.
[189:17.71]I might have been able to do it.
[189:21.17]It's actually really not a bad place to click because this could be right in the middle.
[189:27.70]the uh the rooftop very greasy I feel like I'm gonna die you're right I know I just felt like you were gonna like see something in this city and instantly destroy me like that yep
[189:56.23]Oh, this is so far down into South America.
[190:01.22]Are you kidding me?
[190:01.90]Really?
[190:02.10]You got there closer than I did?
[190:06.24]How?
[190:07.70]It was a... a football bus.
[190:26.97]Oh man, I could totally go to school here and then play demons on my off time.
[190:44.98]Such a small road.
[191:04.05]This is really fucking cool looking, actually.
[191:05.91]Dude, I was gonna say Tokyo, but I was like, there's no way it's that Tokyo.
[191:12.38]It's Tokyo, like, every time.
[191:13.92]I mean, they must have a higher density of, you know, cars driving around there.
[191:47.24]Jesus you're dead I went too fast I saw Slovenia Slovakia I went too fast I that was based off the last name on a gravestone I looked over immediately I would have killed you immediately I just I thought it was blurred out a little it was like it was slow yeah god damn you're dead how does it feel
[192:12.96]last one last one okay truly the final one for real it was actually a lot of fun to do like I I don't think I would enjoy this so much uh single player it is really fun yeah this is the true final one this game is fun I told you I got food on the way too okay well it's like the competitive aspect you're trying to do it in a hurry like the whole just sit there for 30 minutes and pause and be a streamer kind of situation he's not doing it for me he has streamer
[192:42.60]Yeah, we're gonna like pause and tell- Oh, wait, wait, you don't even know what you're talking about.
[192:46.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[192:47.66]This big thing you grew up with?
[192:49.08]I grew up with?
[192:49.60]You didn't grow up with that?
[192:50.64]Like, that's weird for you?
[192:53.40]So everybody didn't do this one thing that I always did as a child.
[192:59.89]What?
[193:00.27]You gotta-
[193:17.82]I feel like this is gonna annihilate you.
[193:25.38]Maine?
[193:27.70]Yeah.
[193:30.96]Why would they say Quebec City on it and it's in Montreal?
[193:35.98]uh I don't know I'm surprised that I got so like was was so competitive with that guess that was like 100 like I have no clue these houses look look expensive
[194:12.28]what I'm learning is that I need to like educate myself and stop being so dumb about any country that uses this language that's what I've learned today
[194:43.66]Literally only one country?
[194:45.28]Don't tell me that You're making it up That's Greece
[195:12.65]I was over there too.
[195:14.15]I was right there.
[195:19.81]But I can't tell.
[195:21.15]What?
[195:24.11]Oh shit.
[195:24.61]Oh shit.
[195:46.01]I've got a huge hunch just from what I've seen.
[195:50.89]Where'd that fucking sign just go?
[195:55.52]No, dude, really?
[195:56.62]There's no, like, it's something like that.
[196:00.06]Wait.
[196:01.34]Yeah.
[196:03.18]Shit.
[196:03.52]I gotta, I have to just guess.
[196:06.00]Wait, what were you doing?
[196:08.80]Florida?
[196:09.54]I thought it was Florida.
[196:10.54]I thought it was Florida.
[196:13.49]You thought that was Florida?
[196:15.44]Yeah, it did.
[196:17.52]Left side cars?
[196:18.48]I don't have a driver's license.
[196:19.82]That's not the first thing I look at.
[196:23.19]Florida.
[196:24.47]It might as well have been Florida.
[196:25.75]Alright, uh...
[196:46.38]Too blurry.
[196:47.84]Yeah, this one's kind of looking like Florida, too.
[196:52.89]That's too blurry.
[196:55.01]I can't read.
[196:55.39]It's too blurry.
[197:04.09]It's too blurry.
[197:05.63]It's too blurry.
[197:25.48]It's Kuvlaria.
[197:26.36]I can't read it.
[197:26.94]Fuck.
[197:47.87]Um, um, uh, I'm just gonna, I'm literally just gonna pick, I'm gonna, uh, just take a, I'm gonna take a guess.
[197:52.56]I'm just guessing.
[197:56.54]Yeah, I didn't think it was that far south.
[197:58.66]All the signs were all, I couldn't read them.
[198:30.11]You don't even know.
[198:31.02]You really don't.
[198:33.92]I really don't.
[198:34.58]You literally just did that and now I have to do this.
[198:40.48]Damn.
[198:40.92]I killed myself.
[198:43.86]That had to be a heal round.
[198:45.12]Of course it is.
[198:46.40]Of course it's a heal round.
[199:01.87]Where did I see this before?
[199:05.09]Oh you are- you're fu-
[199:30.51]I did 26 damage to you.
[199:32.18]Okay.
[199:34.68]How come the ones that I beat you in, you are right next to me?
[199:37.53]Because they're the easy ones.
[199:38.65]And you can only do the easy ones.
[200:06.27]The music is very tense.
[200:07.77]It really lights the fire under you.
[200:13.72]I like the hunt for trying to quickly figure out where the most information would be.
[200:17.70]I know, right?
[200:20.39]Desperately searching.
[200:35.17]I don't think I have it right.
[200:35.91]I thought I did immediately, but I don't think so now.
[201:09.16]Oh look it's next to Paris.
[201:11.75]It's right next to London.
[201:12.65]It's right next to Paris.
[201:14.07]I saw a roadmap that was kind of going that angle and I just tried to pick one.
[201:22.92]I saw a roadmap you fuck.
[201:26.24]They're always like right next to Paris, right next to London, right next to like all the major cities.
[201:53.15]God, who has any idea?
[201:55.09]I have a vague idea.
[201:58.13]I have a vague idea too, but how would you... In some architectural... But also, yeah.
[202:15.30]Taking a random... I think that's way off, actually.
[202:31.29]You're fucking dead, dude!
[202:33.72]Honestly, you just get... You and... Here's what ends up happening.
[202:37.22]We're, like, really, really close for, like, the first four or five rounds.
[202:41.20]You were so far away.
[202:42.52]And then the quadruple damage rolls around, and you're, like, equally as fucking wrong, but you still do quadruple, and I'd lose.
[202:51.19]So just get a little bit closer.
[202:52.73]Again?
[202:52.97]Yeah.
[202:53.95]Winner takes all?
[202:54.69]Winner takes all.
[202:57.87]Four million community subs?
[203:01.13]Oh, no.
[203:07.82]Alright, this is it.
[203:08.72]Final one.
[203:09.24]This is for all the marbles.
[203:11.06]Let's go.
[203:35.94]Lurie?
[204:13.25]Yeah, I feel like I went down the wrong road and I'm never gonna see a sign anywhere down here.
[204:18.01]And you're gonna figure something out soon that I'm not gonna know.
[204:43.48]I knew it had to be somewhere like down here.
[204:45.73]Yeah, I was going to put it in Glasgow, honestly.
[204:49.71]And then I was like, I'm going to put it close to the middle in case I'm wrong.
[204:52.74]Most improved one.
[205:23.29]Turn around, turn around, turn around.
[205:24.29]Turn around.
[205:25.21]What?
[205:25.49]I can't read this.
[205:26.61]Yeah, that's the clue.
[205:27.67]That's how I know where we are.
[205:54.73]shit there's a flag right there what is it oh my god it's Switzerland what yeah so on like the fourth round where the quad damages
[206:19.83]What did you even click on?
[206:20.91]Where was that?
[206:21.41]That's Singapore.
[206:24.01]Why was there a Switzerland flag?
[206:26.44]There was a Swi- There was a flag.
[206:28.58]It seemed like it was near an airport or something.
[206:30.54]It was like a bus terminal.
[206:32.10]It was the Swiss Embassy.
[206:37.93]That's so fucking annoying.
[206:39.65]Alright, I gotta get it together.
[206:43.54]I see the one flag.
[206:44.76]It's like the Swiss flag, and it's the embassy in Singapore.
[206:49.06]Where is this?
[206:50.28]Why don't I know where this is?
[206:52.67]It was somewhere in here.
[206:53.89]I don't fucking remember.
[206:57.57]Dude, you can't be serious.
[207:03.05]You're gonna, I'm, that's over.
[207:03.87]I lose.
[207:06.23]I have absolutely no idea where this is.
[207:07.96]I'm just gonna put it right in the middle of China.
[207:09.28]It's on the screen.
[207:11.98]Yeah, I... What are you doing?
[207:14.90]I had no... I didn't even have a chance.
[207:17.53]That one didn't count.
[207:18.37]That one sucked.
[207:19.13]I turned the corner to a giant mall of Montenegro.
[207:23.15]Yeah, but okay, so I turned around and I see like the Swiss flag on a building and all of a sudden, no, sorry, that's the embassy, dickhead!
[207:30.45]Okay, so you want one more.
[207:31.61]One more.
[207:32.71]Okay, my food's at the door.
[207:33.95]I just want to make it so it's not in the cold.
[207:35.51]Okay, well, speedrun.
[207:37.04]We have literally 10 seconds.
[207:39.15]My food is literally at the door.
[207:40.45]I'll be right back in 10 seconds.
[207:41.93]Go, go, go, go.
[207:55.64]Try USA only.
[207:58.42]Oh, okay.
[208:02.42]Famous places, USA.
[208:04.52]Let's do USA.
[208:06.02]That sounds good.
[208:07.70]This is so much fun.
[208:11.26]Okay, I lied.
[208:11.80]It's not even there.
[208:12.28]Let's go.
[208:12.76]Alright, we're doing United States.
[208:14.76]Okay.
[208:15.34]Play again?
[208:16.08]Play again.
[208:16.46]United States.
[208:22.21]This is only in the United States.
[208:24.97]Okay.
[208:25.17]See how much you know.
[208:35.58]I already have an idea.
[208:42.65]Yeah, here it feels like if I just guess, I'm pretty close.
[208:46.59]But you can't fuck up a guess here.
[208:48.55]I'm gonna try and get as close as humanly possible.
[208:57.09]Yep.
[208:58.11]I think I'm gonna be pretty close.
[209:32.28]I mean, it could be anything, though.
[209:35.23]Hold on.
[209:36.05]He doesn't know.
[209:40.29]He doesn't know.
[209:45.78]If I could click any faster than this.
[209:49.34]he's not gonna get any closer any quicker he's nobody I've crushed him how many times now oh come on it was Florida it was Georgia and you know it it was not Georgia palm trees I don't care I'm a hobbit man I just have my comfortable little sofa and my little spot and I wanted to have my books and I don't care
[210:19.81]I'm like pissed.
[210:21.63]Why are you so mad?
[210:23.13]Because I thought I had it right.
[210:25.73]He doesn't know.
[210:27.31]He doesn't fucking know.
[210:30.67]I'm guessing.
[210:52.25]you just guessed dude really I can guess here way better than you can guess really I I don't have any idea I've I've no idea I I actually have absolutely no clue oh apparently I was supposed to see it apparently I was thinking I don't know like one of the carolinas I can't guess good
[211:29.19]This one has to be Greece.
[211:33.05]Imagine you clicked Greece.
[212:01.64]Oh, I absolutely have an idea.
[212:04.26]Oh, you better believe that I have an idea.
[212:05.64]Another one.
[212:06.59]What?
[212:39.96]fucking sub work from somewhere in na literally all of these are in na you're gonna have to narrow it down a little bit more than that I I think it needs a little more narrowing down because it could be there's a few places this could be I have yeah I feel like I'm close but I don't have a lock on
[213:14.91]Ah, Jermis thinks he's got it.
[213:17.91]I pretty much have to just click now.
[213:26.16]What?!
[213:27.48]The dude, the car that we started next to pointing at, the red truck that we started next to had Pennsylvania on it.
[213:33.40]But there was a church across from a church across from a church.
[213:38.37]That's very like up in that area too.
[213:43.64]Like, all of the East Coast is all of the churches.
[214:04.82]Hey, slow down.
[214:05.74]Slow down, dude.
[214:06.53]Come on.
[214:08.77]And if you're not from US, like how political all this shit honestly is where every single lawn has like, vote for this person, vote for this person.
[214:15.83]We're not seeing that anywhere else.
[214:17.99]This guy had an Obama shirt on.
[214:19.47]What did you get?
[214:28.30]What kind of genre of food do you have?
[214:31.93]I got this place called Austin Burger Company.
[214:34.36]I've never heard of it.
[214:35.36]But Boston Burger Company is the best burger.
[214:38.50]So I'm hoping... I think me and Holly are going to get McDonald's.
[214:42.60]Okay, that's fantastic.
[214:44.74]For you and Holly.
[214:52.64]There's no... There's nothing giving me any information here.
[215:06.56]is that a guess or did you see a sign or something uh we'll see how much of a guess it was when we see how close I am I don't know I don't know right okay I mean it was the poverty I gotta get you right here this is the next round after this I gotta get you
[216:07.98]It's always on the fucking healing rounds, okay?
[216:10.19]I always, like, clean it up on the healing rounds.
[216:14.21]Seriously, like, I would have wiped them out, like, five times.
[216:20.84]Yeah, I bet.
[216:21.94]You didn't even click on Santa Monica Boulevard, by the way.
[216:25.56]I couldn't find the street.
[216:27.38]I, like, didn't even move once.
[216:28.66]I didn't see what cross street we were on.
[217:05.44]There's no way I lose.
[217:14.38]What'd you see?
[217:15.58]St.
[217:15.78]Petersburg.
[217:16.22]It was on one of the trash cans.
[217:17.28]Oh, I don't even know what that is.
[217:19.34]Okay, we're walling in.
[217:25.78]We're walling in citizens.
[217:27.20]By the way, how do I click on the, like, within, like, five miles of the city and it's triple damage and you still, like...
[217:34.31]because I was not that far off my chat thinks St.
[217:49.81]Petersburg is in Russia
[218:07.76]What?
[218:10.28]How do you?
[218:10.90]Every time it's times four damage, you immediately know where to go.
[218:14.73]You're gonna die.
[218:15.61]It's times three, by the way.
[218:19.89]How the fuck?
[218:21.29]It's times three.
[218:23.31]How is it even possible?
[218:26.08]You're dead.
[218:26.50]You're gonna have to hold that.
[218:28.86]Every times four, this motherfucker just guesses immediately and gets it right immediately.
[218:32.62]You just must know where this stuff is.
[218:35.83]saw signs of Louisiana on a mini mart you're just getting lucky every fourth round every fifth round oh I guess I just keep getting luckier than you it must suck to be so unlucky it's I know it sucks man I'd stop my totally five times one more oh oh I gotta grab my food actually this time okay
[218:59.91]Alright, you run it, you look back, and you see every fifth round.
[219:03.93]Every fifth round, it's like five seconds go by, and then it's... Do famous places?
[219:18.52]Okay.
[219:21.05]That's fun.
[219:22.33]Oh, making this 20 seconds.
[219:23.91]I feel like I have a, I feel like I have a better chance of beating you if we're in America.
[219:28.15]Because Ashley keeps telling me she's going to go on the run and I've really practiced how to locate her.
[219:36.25]This is famous places in the world, apparently, which good luck.
[219:39.46]I don't think I'm gonna be able to get any of these.
[219:42.82]The more famous it is, the more likely I have no idea.
[219:45.46]I know.
[219:45.90]I know this one right off the bat.
[219:48.34]Too bad it's not round fucking five.
[219:57.73]Here's the problem though.
[220:01.97]I don't actually know where the fuck this place is.
[220:03.79]Well, take your time.
[220:05.01]I've got some soggy fries.
[220:06.27]Where is it?
[220:36.11]Where is this place?
[220:38.21]I don't- I actually don't fucking know where it is.
[220:40.19]I know wha- I know this exact monument thing, but I don't know where it is on a map!
[220:45.85]Yeah, I don't know either.
[220:46.59]I think that's it.
[220:48.33]Oh my god, I don't know where it is.
[220:50.15]I don't know, man.
[220:52.31]I don't know, it's- it- I don't know where it is.
[220:53.77]It's fucking goddamn- it's the tallest building in the world in Dubai.
[220:57.99]Yeah, I- I picked the wrong, like, bay for Dubai.
[221:01.89]It's the- I just didn't know where to look.
[221:02.99]I knew that I was wrong.
[221:03.52]I zoomed in and I didn't see it and I was like, that's weird.
[221:14.59]Oh, you gotta get, like, the street.
[221:16.68]I know, seriously.
[222:07.56]oh nice good job I didn't bother to look for the specifics I just said you for no reason that was like rude nope um you actually know what this is
[222:36.85]No, I see you in guest land.
[222:38.59]I know it's somewhere.
[222:39.57]Please stop throwing.
[222:44.88]Those motherfuckers.
[222:51.40]What?
[222:51.94]Come on, guys.
[222:53.28]Is it good?
[222:54.10]Is food good?
[222:55.18]Yeah, it's pretty good.
[223:10.11]I don't.
[223:11.45]It's whatever this is.
[223:12.33]This thing here.
[223:22.75]My connection sucks.
[223:23.73]I can't even see.
[223:24.21]It's all blurred out.
[223:24.95]Oh, yeah.
[223:27.91]I'm wrong.
[223:30.43]How did we both get zero?
[223:35.32]I was closer.
[223:38.35]I don't like this one.
[223:42.97]I'm too stupid.
[223:43.75]I don't know anything.
[223:46.63]This is that like famous, um, there's a famous, uh, famous bridge.
[223:56.20]This is not easy.
[223:58.27]Is this the London Bridge?
[223:59.27]Did I just give it away?
[224:09.41]It is.
[224:10.97]Why don't I say that out loud?
[224:11.81]I don't know.
[224:17.17]Neither, like, we're either gonna nu- No one's gonna score points.
[224:23.70]I want a real game.
[224:25.30]Okay, well, um... The real question is, where, where are these?
[224:32.62]Oh, I fucking- okay.
[224:34.70]Did you get it wrong?
[224:36.40]Yeah, I put it in Las Vegas.
[224:41.42]I don't know where they are, though.
[224:49.58]Okay, yeah, it's Cairo.
[224:52.14]Did I just kill you?
[224:53.12]Yeah, so not... The famous pyramids of Egypt are not in Libya.
[224:58.20]No, they aren't.
[224:59.54]Okay.
[224:59.83]Can we do a real game?
[225:00.91]You want to do another real one?
[225:02.77]You don't want to do a real one?
[225:03.93]Not monuments?
[225:04.55]I don't like famous places.
[225:06.29]Famous places are lame.
[225:07.31]Okay.
[225:08.21]I like to support local business.
[225:09.81]United States again?
[225:13.73]Sure, if you want to.
[225:14.41]Yeah.
[225:14.57]Alright.
[225:14.89]This is actually the last one because I'm starving.
[225:17.07]Plus, it's getting really late.
[225:18.65]This has been a lot of fun though.
[225:28.31]This is the United States.
[225:35.74]Yo, no shit it is.
[225:38.80]Is it?
[225:43.85]No, it's that one place!
[225:46.70]The other place.
[225:47.70]The lamer place.
[225:48.70]No!
[226:13.61]I just... I need an extra minute.
[226:19.33]That's like we're still doing famous places.
[226:21.99]That was in my brain for some reason.
[226:25.78]I clicked central New Jersey.
[226:31.08]Oops.
[226:35.12]The first two rounds don't even matter.
[226:36.38]It's round eight that is the only one that matters.
[226:39.34]Why are you so mad about that?
[227:03.28]This could be I Know I understand that you're like taking a fight and just guessing randomly, but yeah, but I'm still gonna beat you up It doesn't really matter
[227:25.74]Alright, we both thinking the same thing.
[227:27.02]I was thinking like Portland.
[227:29.60]Portland area.
[227:32.92]You just said you don't even think these rounds matter.
[227:36.50]Yeah, but I mean whatever.
[227:37.38]Yeah, this one's a crease.
[228:24.06]Oh no, you can't look at license plates.
[228:25.50]That's kind of, um... Cannot.
[228:27.64]That's some NSA level stuff.
[228:32.16]I... This actually might be... I don't want to say it.
[228:38.63]Why does the sun have to be so... bright?
[228:46.67]Yeah, every sign I've looked at, when you zoom in, it's like a pure white sign.
[228:59.28]Yeah, I gotta get... I'm getting away from the sun.
[229:05.42]He's using the sun-ization technique.
[229:10.23]Oh, damn.
[229:10.85]Dead end?
[229:33.98]this is such a... average place an average city?
[229:42.26]yeah but with like no commercial areas so you can't actually see like business addresses or anything like that everything's just blown up by the sun
[230:01.06]I'm going up this way.
[230:37.97]I don't know.
[230:38.45]I mean, I think I'm just gonna go for it here.
[230:47.40]I mean, this round doesn't matter, right?
[230:49.52]Not necessarily.
[230:50.32]None of the rounds matter.
[230:51.34]Not until it's four times damage and I win, so...
[231:15.27]Okay.
[231:15.67]I was thinking like San Diego or whatever.
[231:19.37]I was thinking like somewhere around like El Paso.
[231:22.81]It said La Mesa.
[231:27.21]I don't know what that is.
[231:36.27]Okay.
[231:36.59]I like can't move down this road.
[231:38.05]Yeah.
[231:38.39]It's hard to drive.
[231:42.83]In either direction?
[231:47.42]oh I'm ready to guess this is yeah this is bad I'm trying to eat over here oh I see something get closer
[232:25.51]I'm going for it.
[232:28.23]I just want to get to this one building.
[232:29.89]I'm going for it.
[232:30.78]I'm going for it.
[232:31.60]I'm going for it.
[232:32.12]I'm going for it.
[232:37.24]I'm just gonna stay somewhere like around here.
[232:47.94]This is a lot of trees.
[232:51.86]Really.
[232:53.90]I mean, Vermont and New Hampshire look... I mean, that's what it looks like during like the spring and summer.
[233:06.63]Is that snow or solar ash?
[233:12.55]I don't know, Ster.
[233:13.13]I think it might be solar ash.
[233:15.68]Okay, then.
[233:16.06]I think I know where we are.
[233:37.47]Still a shitload of people here and it's late.
[233:41.76]Oh my god, I'm so fucking... I'm surprised.
[233:49.88]I mean, I don't know where this would be, but... I'll say, like, somewhere around here.
[234:00.35]Really?
[234:00.63]You saw a sign for St.
[234:01.85]Louis, didn't you?
[234:03.79]I did.
[234:04.03]It was a healing realm.
[234:05.23]Whatever.
[234:05.75]None of the realms matter.
[234:33.71]I got really lucky with that St.
[234:34.90]Louis.
[234:35.38]I had no idea where I was.
[234:46.95]This one is America.
[234:49.82]It's very America.
[235:08.64]It's a little bit too America.
[235:14.36]Thing is, I don't know where that is.
[235:17.79]I think it's here.
[235:25.75]I'm pretty sure it's like up here.
[235:26.79]I think it's like up here.
[235:33.00]I'm like 99.9% certain that it's like here.
[235:37.49]I'm about to get destroyed.
[235:39.93]Is it right here?
[235:40.79]Or is it like up here?
[235:45.27]Yeah, okay, I got it.
[235:50.84]Kentucky!
[235:54.15]Oh, what, really?
[235:54.75]Yeah, that's a lot, man.
[235:56.87]No, I mean, on two times damage, that was all my life.
[235:59.92]Because I pretty much was... I literally got, like, almost the exact place.
[236:03.44]Yeah, I really thought it was up there, too, but... I wanted to put somewhere more middle.
[236:08.18]Yeah.
[236:08.86]Because I was very unsure.
[236:10.02]That's crazy.
[236:11.88]We're going to play one more, right?
[236:13.70]I got to call it, man.
[236:15.32]You're eating.
[236:16.10]I haven't eaten all day.
[236:17.66]Yeah, that's why we can do one more.
[236:26.60]Alright, this is the last one.
[236:27.56]For real.
[236:36.25]Everybody's betting all the doubters, right?
[236:37.87]I mean, you're just so confident and you lost all your points.
[236:40.45]What is this photo?
[237:01.97]What?
[237:03.76]My brother lives here.
[237:08.66]Where can you drive that fast on the highway?
[237:11.58]I don't know where this is.
[237:14.06]The speed limit on the highway?
[237:15.60]That's fucking crazy.
[237:16.78]You know where this is?
[237:18.51]I don't know where this is.
[237:20.55]I know the general area.
[237:21.67]I mean, I have... I'm gonna be closer than you, and it's only the first round, and you're gonna heal this in, like, my... You gotta go, so...
[237:34.62]speed limit in Idaho on highways is 75. pay for sale I just said that out loud one idiot I don't know what you said
[238:21.97]Don't they usually say what like first like town or county or whatever?
[238:26.94]Where is that?
[238:28.14]I don't know.
[238:52.10]I don't know.
[238:52.70]I don't know.
[238:53.40]I don't know.
[238:54.06]I don't know.
[238:55.04]It looks like Philadelphia, like Pennsylvania or something.
[239:04.68]Yeah, I found out.
[239:05.38]I would have never guessed California until I saw this sign.
[239:13.69]I was originally thinking like Georgia.
[239:15.13]Pittsburgh or something.
[239:21.30]This is a hiking trail or whatever.
[239:22.74]How are we supposed to know where this is?
[239:26.65]That's part of the fun.
[239:30.54]I'm noticing some birch.
[239:31.94]There's a lot of birch around here.
[239:47.44]it's looking pretty close to Montenegro again I almost want to say it's a dead end but here I have the edge
[240:17.19]I win right now.
[240:17.77]If you find something that I don't... I mean, there's nothing out here.
[240:22.26]I don't think you have to worry about that.
[240:31.54]Yeah, actually?
[240:34.63]I'm at another dead end.
[240:35.53]Where the hell am I?
[240:47.02]What was sold over here?
[240:49.82]I'm just going for what I would... I mean, I'm just going to go for it like somewhere like up here.
[240:58.84]No shit.
[241:00.30]I didn't really put Alaska on here.
[241:03.18]Yeah, I forgot it was a thing.
[241:13.56]Bible.
[241:26.90]What is that?
[241:32.29]I've got you.
[241:34.03]Too bad it's just a shitty healing round.
[241:36.55]Too bad it's just a stupid shitty healing round.
[241:53.25]I'm closer than you.
[241:54.08]You're closer than me?
[241:55.32]Bullshit.
[242:01.60]How did you find that out?
[242:03.56]A couple buildings had Hawaiian on it and I picked the biggest Hawaiian city.
[242:08.75]Because it was a big city.
[242:10.99]Which I had no idea Honolulu was that big of a city.
[242:33.86]Are you serious?
[242:34.32]Let me break.
[242:36.18]I mean, I'm full health.
[242:37.74]Good job.
[242:39.20]You better guess well.
[242:40.04]I was looking for 81.
[242:58.48]Double damage, it begins.
[242:59.54]You ready?
[243:00.00]This is where it actually matters, yeah.
[243:09.48]A lot of cars here, a lot of endless roads, a lot of cars.
[244:06.72]there's a home depot here this could be anywhere I mean it could this could be it could be anywhere in this entire country got it yeah wait you actually got it no you cannot no you do not two times damage are you about to win
[244:36.19]Oh, it's Seattle!
[244:39.64]God damn it!
[244:41.02]What?
[244:41.44]Houston.
[244:44.92]The Space Needle was just on there!
[244:46.82]Look, that's the goddamn Space Needle!
[244:51.14]What are you talking about?
[244:53.14]It's Houston!
[244:54.10]That's the Space Needle right there.
[244:55.51]That's the Space Needle in Seattle.
[244:59.49]Does Houston have a Space Needle too?
[245:03.21]Houston is a pretty big city look at that is the god look at this this right here that you can't see it that well but that is the space needle that's not a pen that is a space needle do you see this thing right here that's the space needle that's an like an
[245:31.39]It is, actually.
[245:32.21]I see it.
[245:32.61]What are you talking about?
[245:33.67]Am I crazy?
[245:39.39]That's literally, like, the Space Needle.
[245:42.09]Or, like, the Stratosphere in Vegas.
[245:44.63]It's one of those, like, spaceship things with the needle on top.
[245:49.11]Oh, come on.
[245:52.65]That's not a pen!
[245:53.55]I think it's an arrow pointing upwards, dude.
[245:58.03]No, it's not.
[245:58.59]That is the Space Needle.
[246:00.57]Okay, we'll go back to Houston and find that street and zoom in and prove it.
[246:06.11]Why would you have the Space Needle or the Stratosphere in Houston as your logo?
[246:15.33]Uh, I don't know.
[246:16.63]How come every single pizza place in New Jersey is a New York pizza?
[246:21.58]It is the Space Needle.
[246:22.60]That's what I'm saying.
[246:29.30]Alright, that's it.
[246:31.14]Call those guys up and ask.
[246:33.42]What the fuck?
[246:36.28]Alright, that's it.
[246:37.54]Maybe the company's from Seattle.
[246:39.08]But I thought it was like, oh, Space Needle.
[246:42.07]Whatever.
[246:46.37]Yeah.
[246:47.89]Yeah, maybe.
[246:51.91]I'll see you around, kid.

[247:02.56]We've got to go.
[247:04.92]He's already gone.
[247:05.46]He didn't even say bye.
[247:06.16]What the fuck?
[247:08.60]Don't ever bet for me ever again.
[247:09.94]I won like five of those.

[247:19.91]And I will see you guys on Sunday.
[247:23.61]Sunday the 20th.
[247:24.95]Not sure what we're going to do.
[247:29.33]We'll do something, though.
[247:31.25]That was a lot of fun.
[247:33.75]I was so confident that was like, bang, we're right in the middle.
[247:36.10]This is Seattle.
[247:41.36]Yeah, I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[247:42.44]We'll figure out what we're going to do.
[247:44.42]Good night.
[247:44.96]Goodbye.
[247:45.48]Thanks for watching, everybody, as always.
[247:50.26]Do you want my final thoughts on Dying Light 2?
[247:51.96]It's okay.
[247:53.96]I mean, we spent like an hour and 25 minutes talking shit about like the entire video game industry.
[248:00.13]But, you know.
[248:03.19]I guess that's the way it is.
[248:11.17]What about the 100 subs?
[248:12.23]I still can't pay for anything on Twitch.
[248:15.47]So, I need to contact somebody.
[248:18.75]Whether it's my bank doing it or it's Twitch doing it, I don't know.
[248:25.02]But, I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[248:26.36]Probably starting around the same time.
[248:27.96]So, remember, probably 2 or 3.
[248:30.34]Let's just say three.
