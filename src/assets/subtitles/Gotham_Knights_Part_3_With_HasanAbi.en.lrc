[00:02.18]I have a question.
[00:04.70]How do you do the pointing emoji on PC?
[00:10.92]Can somebody just do it so I can just copy it?
[00:15.70]Was the pointing like a finger pointing?
[00:18.34]Yes.
[00:18.90]Yeah, there you go.
[00:22.43]Thank you.
[00:22.71]Alright, I'll be back.
[00:37.81]I apparently didn't copy it.
[00:40.47]How come I didn't copy it?
[00:42.23]It's... Oh, that's... It's a... Well, hold on.
[00:44.89]It's a... It's because it's a BTTV emote.
[00:48.80]That's a middle finger.
[00:50.68]I need, like, the pointing finger that's not from BTTV because I need to put it in the... I want to put it in the title.
[01:04.28]Do Windows plus... I'm not going to do that.
[01:06.70]Windows plus for an emoji.
[01:10.56]How do I... Can somebody just write it so I can do it?
[01:13.52]Oh, there you go.
[01:13.90]Thank you.
[01:15.86]There you go.
[01:16.59]There it is.
[01:16.89]That's what I want.
[01:17.43]Thank you.
[01:17.93]Alright.
[01:18.53]Appreciate it.
[01:19.05]This title is so bad.
[01:31.64]Actually, I like it.
[01:34.29]I actually like this title.
[01:35.43]Okay.
[01:53.76]Wait, did you put the pointing thing in already?
[02:04.00]What do you mean Neopets?
[02:05.30]What are you talking about?
[02:08.85]Why are you guys saying Neopets?
[02:13.83]This has nothing to do with what I'm doing.
[02:15.13]Alright, I'll be back.
[02:15.77]I'll be right back.
[02:16.27]Alright, I'm actually going to be right back.
[10:14.23]Okay.
[10:16.05]What's that?
[10:22.72]I had to get my tweet ready.
[10:23.74]I forgot about it.
[10:29.82]Are we all ready?
[10:32.97]Getting there?
[10:35.79]Very cool.
[10:36.65]I'm going to do my tweet.
[10:54.23]There it is.
[10:55.23]Alright.
[10:57.72]Let me just capture the game.
[10:59.10]That's important.
[10:59.80]Oh, I got to do my... Hold on.
[11:02.18]This is important too.
[11:07.36]Let me get this out of the way.
[11:12.47]Because I need to make sure my webcam is not going to freak out.
[11:35.99]Alright, so we're going to do co-op.
[11:40.43]Let's see.
[11:41.17]Let me talk to the people here.
[11:42.65]Put this in.
[11:46.87]Alright.
[11:48.49]I'm going to say, alright.
[11:50.87]That's how you know it's about to start when I say, alright.
[11:57.70]But seriously though, alright.
[12:03.46]This switch is not available right now.
[12:10.79]Turn that off.
[12:12.88]Turn this off.
[12:16.94]Okay.
[12:20.22]I'm ready to play Gotham Knights.
[12:21.64]I had to pee.
[12:33.94]Okay.
[12:43.19]Your title still says Zelda.
[12:44.41]That's changing.
[12:53.16]Oh, I gotta plug this in.
[12:56.44]That is changing very shortly.
[12:59.22]No, it doesn't.
[12:59.68]I just got... You just gaslit me so bad, didn't you?
[13:07.57]Alrighty.
[13:07.99]Alrighty, alrighty.
[13:09.81]Alrighty.
[13:10.43]Alrighty.
[13:13.52]Jesus Christ man.
[13:15.30]Alright.
[13:16.92]I gotta think some more filler words than just okay.
[13:19.45]Alright.
[13:20.73]Alright Uh-huh.
[13:31.61]Uh-huh.
[13:32.87]Uh-huh Yeah
[13:40.46]The last thing I- I was playing as Batgirl, but, uh, I was- I was hit up by a one- a son.
[13:47.54]He said, hey, uh, I think, uh, I think we need to do some co-op stuff for the campaign.
[13:53.09]And I was like, huh?
[13:53.53]So, let's call him.
[13:54.01]See if he's available.
[13:54.93]Right?
[14:09.20]Hey, what's up?
[14:09.82]Oh, I can't hear you.
[14:10.94]Hold on.
[14:11.12]I don't know what he's saying.
[14:12.00]I can't hear him.
[14:12.48]Oh, no.
[14:12.62]I have to change you, too.
[14:13.32]Have you played this game at all?
[14:14.24]Oh, yeah.
[14:14.50]I've been playing for like three days.
[14:15.91]Have you done the tutorial?
[14:38.94]No.
[14:39.78]You might have to do the tutorial.
[14:42.34]Okay.
[14:42.80]Are you going to carry me after then?
[14:44.87]Yeah, I'll carry you.
[14:45.75]Just once you can do multiplayer, we'll just give me a ping.
[14:48.57]This is like, this is a classic.
[14:50.63]Another classic goof and gaff session where Jorma carries me through.
[14:55.01]Hey, dude, are you ready to goof off?
[14:56.77]It's going to be so fun.
[14:57.83]I'm going to goof off.
[14:59.19]I'm goofy.
[14:59.91]I'm goofy with it.
[15:00.77]Okay.
[15:01.05]I'm going to finish this video first.
[15:02.54]Alright.
[15:03.18]Get out of here and do the tutorial for God's sakes.
[15:08.23]Okay, I gotta put him through a different... Yeah, hold on.
[15:18.65]Uh, hold on.
[15:19.47]Alright, I'm muted there.
[15:22.37]Let me, uh... I gotta change this.
[15:26.59]We'll play as a backer for a little bit.
[15:28.95]And then when he's ready, we'll go from there.
[15:32.26]We're gonna goof off.
[15:32.86]It's gonna be goofy.
[15:34.99]Alright, so my input is fine, but the output is the problem.
[15:38.01]The output, because he's coming through, the wrong thing.
[15:42.70]I wonder if that's going to be better.
[15:45.94]We'll test it when he gets back.
[15:49.62]And yeah, I know my webcam's freaking out.
[15:51.26]There's nothing I can do about it.
[15:58.42]It says I'm playing as Robin.
[16:00.88]Uh-oh, that's bad.
[16:06.10]This is not Robin.
[16:14.23]Wait a minute, we're not even on the same... We're not even on the same mission.
[16:18.39]We're not even close.
[16:21.99]Is he going to be level one?
[16:23.27]Hey, can we ride the car together?
[16:39.07]But anyways, we're about to start.
[16:41.25]At least I am.
[16:43.07]Welcome, everybody.
[16:43.55]This is a sponsored stream.
[16:45.22]Gotham Knights is currently out now.
[16:46.82]It's for the Xbox Series S, the Xbox... X?
[16:50.88]The PC, the... What did I just say?
[16:52.62]The PlayStation 5.
[16:54.26]It's got co-op.
[16:55.04]We're gonna show that today.
[16:56.01]This is Batgirl.
[16:56.73]You're gonna see Robin.
[16:58.93]Open world.
[16:59.99]Batman-like game.
[17:04.55]Alright, so let me do this mission.
[17:08.07]Dude, you got to really lean into it.
[17:19.00]Turn around.
[17:19.56]Why would I turn around?
[17:24.78]You need your overlay.
[17:25.58]You guys are just on point.
[17:27.28]You really are.
[17:31.88]Where am I going to go?
[17:32.58]Down here, right?
[17:33.28]Yeah.
[17:40.35]Yeah, I got an image panel.
[17:42.01]There's a panel down below.
[17:43.50]If you click it, it'll take you to the opportunity for you to buy Gotham Knights.
[17:50.10]Why does it want me to turn around?
[17:50.88]It's over here.
[18:03.23]Yeah, thanks, Warner Brothers, for sponsoring this segment of today's stream.
[18:07.03]I'm gonna switch to Robin, I promise.
[18:11.39]Batgirl, I'm leaving.
[18:12.76]What?
[18:17.94]What did that person say?
[18:18.80]Alright.
[18:26.68]Did I actually have to go the other way?
[18:30.75]Shut up!
[18:32.11]What are they talking about?
[18:32.81]Alright, hold on.
[18:33.45]I need to go...
[18:41.72]Who's he talking to?
[18:43.46]Somebody did something that exploded!
[18:47.54]Um... Excuse me?
[18:54.30]What's with that fucking in-menu BM bullshit?
[18:56.52]Alright, I'm outta here.
[19:14.08]Batgirl, I'm leaving.
[19:15.26]Because I'm not playing as Robin.
[19:23.32]What is going on here?
[19:24.36]Is that her?
[19:25.00]What was that?
[19:25.40]What?
[19:27.97]No, I'm locked into the mission.
[19:29.39]I'm already locked into the mission.
[19:36.81]Don't throw stuff into cars, idiot.
[19:45.29]Did I go on that bridge this way and I'm coming back on this bridge that way?
[19:51.31]I'm doing it my way.
[20:06.54]OK, so there he is.
[20:09.18]Let's see what's going on here.
[20:35.58]Colonel Kane.
[20:36.82]Who's that?
[20:37.70]Sergeant Pennyworth.
[20:40.78]Why is he wearing a Catwoman suit?
[20:43.20]I'm sorry I had to push our meeting so late.
[20:46.06]Work never seems to stop in this city.
[20:48.64]Oh, I can certainly relate.
[20:50.80]The paperwork hasn't let up since Bruce's passing.
[20:54.51]Yeah.
[20:56.03]I still can't believe it.
[21:01.59]Burying Bruce was the hardest thing I've ever done.
[21:04.63]Yeah.
[21:08.01]I'm gonna switch to Robin after this.
[21:11.04]I was just close to it, so I wanna get it done.
[21:14.62]You said, life matters when death matters.
[21:20.19]We take the living for granted until they're gone.
[21:25.10]What settings am I on?
[21:25.64]I'm on... So I have a 3090.
[21:26.12]And I have a 1440p resolution.
[21:26.88]60fps frame rate I think.
[21:27.54]I do get a little bit of stuttering.
[21:29.38]But... What is going on?
[21:54.26]every day I find new reasons to be proud empty your pockets or empty the gun we're gonna get like an alfred moment here where he's like you know what never mind oh um
[22:24.02]That punk didn't know who he was messing with.
[22:30.38]Wow, holy shit.
[22:34.19]Don't have to twist my arm.
[22:36.65]Let's not be long though.
[22:38.23]Isn't Batgirl supposed to be in this cutscene?
[22:40.81]Oh, I was observing the cutscene from up there.
[22:51.41]Alright, Belfry.
[22:52.67]What do you have on the court?
[22:54.71]The Court of Owls.
[22:56.23]A secret society as old as Gotham itself.
[22:59.03]Run the city behind closed doors.
[23:01.33]According to the old poem... I actually think Batgirl might be... I remember reading about them when I was a kid.
[23:05.37]Well, I can't say that until I play Robin.
[23:06.75]Why would Penguin send us after an old story?
[23:09.91]If this all-powerful court... Let's change to Robin.
[23:12.31]They might be the ones getting all those creeps out of Blackgate.
[23:16.27]Which means they've been getting away with murder for centuries.
[23:20.19]Alright, Robin time.
[23:20.93]Do you have concealer on?
[23:23.27]No, I don't have concealer on.
[23:27.00]It's a face smoothing filter that I have turned on.
[23:34.56]Robin.
[23:35.48]You guys ready?
[23:36.49]I'm the only person on Twitch playing this game with Robin, I think.
[23:53.94]Here we go.
[23:55.16]The title is now accurate.
[23:56.70]Stealth Specialist, Tactical Genius, Bow Staff Prodigy.
[24:05.12]Alright.
[24:06.10]What does Robin got for moves?
[24:09.64]We get it to the gears first.
[24:10.98]Alright.
[24:11.30]I got my suit.
[24:13.10]I actually... Cool.
[24:20.13]Whoa.
[24:25.32]This is Robin's suit in Beyond?
[24:27.96]I mean, this thing, I kind of want to view in this.
[24:34.25]Because when I look at this picture, it's like, okay, that's Robin, I guess.
[24:40.83]I love it.
[24:42.81]Ooh.
[24:43.17]Okay.
[24:48.19]He's got a slingshot.
[24:49.41]Are you shitting me?
[24:54.43]Alright.
[24:56.46]I'm very curious now.
[24:57.96]I'm the only person on Twitch playing with Robin.
[25:01.55]Slugger, shadow, or tinkering?
[25:07.79]Robin produces no sound while running and moves faster.
[25:10.43]Okay.
[25:14.34]Perfectly timed dodge.
[25:16.50]That's kind of good.
[25:20.82]20% more damage when attacking from behind.
[25:22.46]20% more crit damage.
[25:26.38]Robin's decoy inflicts a large amount of... Is this a decoy?
[25:29.24]What's this thing?
[25:33.36]Should I be stealth?
[25:34.66]Stealth Steven?
[25:36.88]Don't do the ghost pepper challenge.
[25:42.91]I'm going for slugger.
[25:45.61]I like doing damage.
[25:46.41]You know what I mean?
[25:48.13]10% crit chance.
[25:48.87]Yeah.
[25:52.97]Decoy.
[25:53.43]Yeah, I'm just going full slugger.
[25:57.90]Alright, let's check out his moveset.
[26:04.90]Jeremiah, chat is unhinged.
[26:07.26]Uh, they'll be alright.
[26:07.86]They'll settle down.
[26:08.34]They'll be alright.
[26:19.23]They settled after a little while.
[26:26.21]I'm actually kind of looking forward to getting in a game with Hasan and his reaction to this character.
[26:36.85]He's going to be like, who are you playing as?
[26:38.51]I'm going to be like, oh, of course, that's Bald Boy.
[26:41.93]Hasan, you don't know who fucking Bald Boy is?
[26:43.72]Do you even watch the TV shows or movies?
[26:50.36]Ooh.
[26:51.92]What is this, like little... He throws rocks?
[26:56.31]Alright, let's give it a try.
[27:09.99]I need to make the fast travel thing, don't I?
[27:19.97]Honestly?
[27:22.99]I feel like this is... I feel like I'm traversing more ground than I do with the bike.
[27:31.37]You can just fly around the city like this.
[27:33.15]Okay, so it's over here.
[27:39.78]So, this is the Powers Club.
[27:41.46]This is the culmination of the last thing we did last night.
[27:44.38]Let's go.
[27:46.46]Let's kick some ass!
[28:03.09]Wait, I have a stealth specialist, aren't I?
[28:06.39]I'm inside.
[28:08.05]Good.
[28:08.91]Be careful and let us know what you find.
[28:14.83]Spotted a patrol.
[28:17.47]Level 7, though.
[28:18.27]I might be too in love with this.
[28:20.08]What do you think the poor bastard did?
[28:22.36]What poor bastard?
[28:26.96]As far as I know, I just got a longer break.
[28:31.79]Nobody can see.
[28:32.55]Oh, God.
[28:34.23]Maybe you can.
[28:43.62]You look already seeing this.
[28:45.16]Holy shit.
[28:45.70]That'd be terrifying.
[28:48.78]You know what?
[28:50.65]Why don't... Why doesn't everybody just wear a superhero costume?
[28:53.87]If I lived in this universe, I feel like less people would fuck with you.
[28:57.31]If I lived in any of these superhero universes and I didn't have powers, I would put a costume on.
[29:02.84]And just walk around and shit, like go to the grocery store.
[29:04.84]I feel like people would be like, oh, you're not like a regular guy.
[29:09.11]You're like fucking Burp Man or something, right?
[29:13.91]Who knows?
[29:14.47]Like, I feel like that you'd... I feel like I'd be less inclined to like, oh, I'm going to sneak up behind this guy and stealth kill him.
[29:19.41]If this guy was in like a bright green spandex suit with like a pair of goggles on, I'd be like, oh, fuck, I got to be careful.
[29:26.49]Right?
[29:27.31]Why don't they just wear costumes?
[29:36.39]OK, let's scan the area.
[29:39.27]Ah, blood.
[29:39.83]Through the lamp.
[29:41.86]OK, this way?
[29:42.14]Flip the light switch on the lamp?
[30:11.99]Yeah, you could just make up what your powers were, right?
[30:14.06]Okay, somebody was like, who the heck are you, man?
[30:16.62]I've never seen you around here.
[30:17.58]You're their superhero.
[30:18.56]I'd be like, that's right.
[30:20.32]By the way, if I look at you and I decide, you'll instantly die.
[30:24.63]I feel like people would be like, holy fuck, man, get away from me.
[30:28.25]I'm instant die-rino, right?
[30:32.64]No one would fuck with you.
[30:35.07]And I would hire actors to, like, come after me.
[30:38.99]And I would look at them, and they would just drop down.
[30:41.69]So people wouldn't be able to prove I couldn't do it.
[30:49.17]They said we'd be working at a club.
[30:50.93]This isn't exactly what I had in mind.
[30:53.93]It's a gentleman's club.
[30:55.81]Remain undetected.
[30:56.48]Whatever that means.
[30:58.10]Just saying.
[30:58.72]I was hoping for something a little more clubby and a little less creepy.
[31:02.54]Shit.
[31:02.74]I haven't been detected yet.
[31:05.02]I haven't been detected yet.
[31:05.93]Get out!
[31:46.09]Okay, I'm good.
[31:54.22]This one right here?
[32:16.29]You're aiming at a wall, dude.
[32:21.80]Robin's the coolest character in the fucking game.
[32:35.92]I'm the only one playing him.
[32:45.87]No, Robin's my character.
[33:05.22]No way!
[33:08.08]I'm your worst nightmare, Robin!
[33:10.70]Oh, shit, right in the head!
[33:11.78]A slingshot!
[33:16.15]Hey, duh!
[33:20.15]Oh, right in the eye!
[33:22.09]Is this dangerous or am I just annoying?
[33:24.17]I think everyone right now is not doing anything because they're like, holy shit, wait a minute, this might... I don't think this is like a grown-up.
[33:32.63]This is like a kid in this awesome outfit.
[34:01.50]That's cool.
[34:02.44]Bow staff.
[34:03.02]Okay.
[34:03.30]This is not just a bow staff.
[34:04.48]This is an extendable bow staff.
[34:12.69]It's a telescopic.
[34:14.51]Telescopic.
[34:17.11]Bow staff.
[34:17.65]Find a way.
[34:20.75]Okay.
[34:21.25]Split the switch.
[34:23.09]Let's go.
[34:25.55]Alright.
[34:29.80]Well, it's right there.
[34:34.56]Okay.
[34:35.12]Press the button.
[34:38.04]Oh, I can press it.
[34:41.02]Can I not get in there?
[34:49.21]Hmm.
[34:50.05]How do I get down there?
[34:54.77]Ah, there it is.
[34:55.23]Cool.
[35:04.77]I just want, all of a sudden, to turn the corner and you just hear, Ranger!
[35:09.80]Oh, Robin, you think you're such a smarty.
[35:13.32]Well, I don't think you're going to be so smart after you deal with me.
[35:15.80]Okay.
[35:24.24]Follow the wires now.
[35:27.56]Where do they go now?
[35:28.78]Oh, shit.
[35:29.08]I was too busy, like, talking.
[35:30.46]I missed it.
[35:35.05]I missed it.
[35:35.55]I was talking.
[35:36.04]I'm an idiot.
[35:36.70]Find a way to... Follow the activated wires.
[35:48.89]Was it part of the bust?
[35:55.89]Where was it?
[35:59.09]It's not that thing down there, right?
[36:00.55]Connected to electric... No.
[36:02.80]Back of the bust?
[36:04.93]I just was in my own world.
[36:12.02]Where are they going?
[36:23.01]Oh, come on.
[36:26.97]Alright, follow the wire.
[36:27.91]The wire goes here.
[36:28.69]Then it stops, though.
[36:51.91]Uh.
[36:53.39]I mean, the activated wire is going down there.
[36:57.51]Should I try to go down?
[37:00.71]No.
[37:04.65]Uh.
[37:06.53]Is he for real?
[37:11.39]Oh, I thought OK, I'm sorry.
[37:13.98]That's my bad.
[37:14.80]I thought I had to like follow it.
[37:16.98]It's not like, oh, I thought it was.
[37:18.24]You know what I mean?
[37:19.20]Whatever.
[37:23.29]Nice brain.
[37:23.89]Yeah, what did you get in science?
[37:27.57]Probably a C. I got a D, so I don't care.
[37:30.88]You got a B?
[37:31.18]What's this weird labyrinth?
[37:41.04]I'm going to find out where it leads.
[37:52.51]Lost comms.
[37:54.15]Enable logging mode.
[37:56.09]Something tells me we're going to want to record what's down here.
[37:59.59]OK, follow the blood trail.
[38:04.90]Where am I?
[38:11.14]The blood stops at the wall.
[38:12.90]Weird.
[38:13.22]That's weird.
[38:16.14]No obvious way through here.
[38:18.40]There has to be more to this.
[38:20.15]Yep, right there.
[38:21.66]No, that's a light.
[38:30.00]Spotlight.
[38:30.40]Alright, turn it on.
[38:34.53]OK, that did something.
[38:43.69]Oh shit the court of owls is watching from inside of Gotham's walls.
[38:48.85]God damn it the shadow puzzle Uh, what am I trying to make probably the fountain, right?
[38:54.12]Am I trying to make the thing that's on the wall There's like an eagle every shadow and they rule us one and all
[39:15.22]But no one talks about them, not a whispered word.
[39:18.54]That looks correct.
[39:19.94]So now I gotta do the body, which is down here.
[39:22.48]One more.
[39:28.91]That should be it, right?
[39:33.37]Or if you try to cross them, when a cannon strikes you dead.
[39:38.65]That's not it.
[39:52.88]That's not it.
[40:05.62]Almost was it this wing here?
[40:07.54]I feel like this could be accurate any way this could be.
[40:20.59]Right, depends.
[40:21.33]It's like that different angle.
[40:25.31]No.
[40:32.45]Why did they not do that before?
[40:36.21]What?
[40:41.50]Scared the shit out of me.
[40:43.24]Uh oh.
[40:47.94]It's the owls.
[40:52.04]You are.
[41:09.67]What was that?
[41:14.20]Holy shit, you do a decoy.
[41:16.02]That's cool.
[41:27.01]I know you can't hear me now, Belfry.
[41:29.21]But when you can...
[41:31.72]That's what I'm saying.
[41:35.90]If you're the penguin, your penguin tells the truth.
[41:39.60]If you say you're the penguin, you are being serious.
[41:47.93]By the way, for people that can do this in real life, how?
[41:54.31]How do you do that?
[41:56.21]It doesn't even make any fucking sense that a human being can do that.
[42:01.07]People can do this shit.
[42:03.29]People can do that.
[42:03.91]Alright, look at the blood trail.
[42:14.04]I can because I'm not a weak ass motherfucker.
[42:17.02]Let's see how deep this goes.
[42:19.78]Alright.
[42:25.52]Guess I just follow the blood then.
[42:27.84]Not gross at all.
[42:35.32]Maneuvering around that way, boy, was such a waste.
[42:42.11]So many things we could have done.
[42:45.11]His death has cleared the way for our new acquisition.
[42:48.25]Good.
[42:49.93]However, do try to be careful where you let them dig, my dear.
[42:56.35]As for that other issue... We've already bribed the senators.
[43:00.24]I've been assured your bill will pass early next month.
[43:03.52]Wonderful.
[43:04.62]Volume up.
[43:05.22]I will.
[43:08.40]What is going on with that dog?
[43:17.33]Turn it up.
[43:25.45]I can't move the camera.
[43:26.53]I want to get a close up of the dog's face.
[43:28.09]They're all soft.
[43:43.13]I can't zoom in.
[43:47.25]No, you can't.
[43:49.85]Hold on.
[43:50.89]What about if I crop everybody out in a frame?
[44:05.44]Okay, that's pretty good.
[44:07.46]I like that.
[44:12.14]I should have let a film grain do it.
[44:29.64]I can't change the lighting.
[44:30.54]That's all I can do.
[44:31.46]Okay.
[44:35.60]I got it.
[44:42.63]Oh, it's Otto!
[44:43.35]Oops!
[45:14.36]Wrong fucking way.
[45:15.45]Whatever.
[45:15.85]I guess I technically could run away and then hide.
[45:29.63]Three silent takedowns?
[45:41.90]It counts!
[45:58.11]That was fucking awful.
[46:01.87]Oh my god.
[46:02.31]What a horrible way to go.
[46:28.01]Don't you feel like there should be some, like, the mask sound effects whenever you move around like this?
[46:32.31]Like... I need one more silent takedown.
[46:57.17]Don't ever do that again.
[46:57.91]I mean, I saw a lot of plus twos on that one.
[47:02.85]I don't know.
[47:03.23]Should I do it again?
[47:13.38]See ya.
[47:21.34]Oh, watch this.
[47:21.88]We're gonna take this guy out like this.
[47:24.67]I'm going to meat grind this motherfucker.
[47:27.31]I missed.
[47:39.43]Just backswing with it.
[47:41.51]That's good.
[47:45.61]Ooh.
[48:00.57]Oh, right in the head, really?
[48:01.61]There's more?
[48:13.63]Shit, so bad.
[48:31.47]Ooh, I like that move.
[48:40.55]It bent the staff.
[48:41.97]I hit them so hard in the head.
[48:45.21]I bent the staff around that person's head.
[48:49.09]This is a lot of blood.
[48:51.31]More than most people can spare.
[48:55.08]Easy, Robin.
[48:57.21]Jeez, Robin.
[48:58.05]I mean, I know you took out like 10 people, but... Pull back a little here.
[49:05.79]Uh-oh.
[49:16.50]I hear someone.
[49:17.44]He's still alive.
[49:29.40]Who's this?
[49:29.76]Come on, come on guys, we're healing!
[49:36.96]I ain't the only snake!
[49:38.40]It won't happen again!
[49:39.94]Please!
[49:49.14]Death to the traitor!
[49:53.70]And death to also that guy.
[49:54.74]The guy, the metal bald guy too, I guess.
[49:57.74]I don't know who that is, but death to you.
[49:59.98]Who is this?
[50:24.91]The court cannot forgive your failure.
[50:29.07]You will atone with blood.
[50:31.97]Owlman?
[50:32.41]I won't do anything.
[50:36.35]And you, Vernon, do not belong here.
[50:38.95]The last time an intruder set foot here was more than a century ago.
[50:46.02]The punishment for this insult remains the same.
[50:55.13]Oh, you didn't save that guy.
[50:56.27]Oh shit.
[51:07.73]I missed the QTE?
[51:09.05]No, I didn't.
[51:13.27]Oh my God, it's like a fucking death room.
[51:15.25]This is a horror.
[51:22.84]I was trying to jump through it.
[51:33.14]is not the time to like show off oh my god alright stop it look at all these bones how do you I'm trying to slide why am I not oh just walk through it
[52:08.22]Oh my... Dude, why?
[52:10.88]What?
[52:11.12]That wouldn't be... I'm made out of fucking solid steel.
[52:14.23]It would scrape my chest.
[52:21.37]Shit.
[52:31.38]No!
[52:35.41]This is hard.
[52:36.25]This is actually fucking hard.
[52:46.28]Oh my goodness.
[53:09.54]Jesus.
[53:10.22]Okay.
[53:14.94]I was just going to say, what is this doing down here?
[53:18.88]Oh, dude.
[53:21.71]What?
[53:23.91]Oh, my God, man.
[53:26.71]Get away from me.
[53:27.61]Holy shit, that was impossible.
[53:29.77]I did that.
[53:30.15]I accidentally just did that.
[53:39.27]Sticking that landing makes the whole thing, you know, everything's good.
[53:42.43]These are all bones.
[53:43.40]Everyone's dead.
[53:44.66]Oh, God.
[53:45.46]Game's loud.
[53:45.90]I'll turn it up.
[53:46.30]That should be better.
[53:50.24]There's like a thousand people down here.
[54:01.43]That was insane.
[54:02.97]Hey, Jerma, are you there?
[54:04.33]Oh, my God.
[54:05.07]I thought that was in the game.
[54:08.57]I thought that was in the game.
[54:11.27]Oh, my God.
[54:11.75]That scared the shit out of me.
[54:13.07]It's me.
[54:13.71]Jerma.
[54:14.99]It's me.
[54:16.57]Snake.
[54:17.43]Solid snake.
[54:19.05]I have a question.
[54:20.54]What's up?
[54:21.76]I finished the first mission, but it's still not unlocking multiplayer.
[54:26.06]How do I unlock multiplayer?
[54:28.96]So my multiplayer is unlocked.
[54:31.72]Let me see.
[54:33.76]I wonder if I can just pull you in.
[54:37.98]Because, does anybody know what mission you have to do?
[54:40.05]Because I didn't pay attention to that yesterday or the day before.
[54:44.69]Which one did you pick, by the way?
[54:45.79]Because I'm double gatted up.
[54:49.23]Are you playing as Red Hood?
[54:51.69]Yeah, I got the gat.
[54:53.27]Okay, that's fine.
[54:53.79]I'm playing as the much superior Robin.
[54:57.51]No shot you picked Robin.
[54:59.71]You need to do mission 1.2.
[55:00.67]Let me see if somebody got the answer here.
[55:04.49]Mission 1.2, where you investigate Langstrom's corpse.
[55:07.76]That's the mission you have to complete.
[55:09.08]I did that already.
[55:10.00]I just did that.
[55:10.36]I just investigated that.
[55:11.34]Did you complete it?
[55:12.92]Or, wait, no.
[55:13.82]Uh, I don't think I did.
[55:15.44]Wait, maybe I didn't do it?
[55:16.71]Oh, people are saying, oh, you didn't do it.
[55:18.21]Okay.
[55:20.17]Um...
[55:22.00]Okay, F1, Batman's last case, the Langstrom Drive, right?
[55:25.15]The Belfry's being brought back online.
[55:26.57]Until then, patrol the streets of Gotham and fight criminals.
[55:28.81]That sounds like it.
[55:30.49]It should be 1.2.
[55:36.17]Did you do the part where you investigate the corpse?
[55:38.07]It's like you look at the corpse and it's like a little detective minigame.
[55:42.36]I don't think I did that.
[55:43.26]Yeah.
[55:45.08]No, I have not seen a corpse yet.
[55:46.73]I'm just investigating criminals.
[55:48.23]I'm investigating crimes right now.
[55:50.73]Or not crimes.
[55:51.57]I'm just waiting for crimes to happen so I can deliver some swift vigilante justice in the form of Red Hood with my guns.
[55:58.51]Yeah, the game is that you have to... You do crime.
[56:02.22]You solve crimes and stuff in the kind of in-between of the main missions.
[56:06.10]I don't do crime.
[56:06.52]I solve crimes.
[56:09.76]Can I be the one that says that kind of stuff?
[56:11.38]Because I'm Robin.
[56:12.00]Wait, okay.
[56:12.56]What are the vibes?
[56:16.51]What would my vibes be?
[56:17.87]I'm solving the... Wait, did you say you were solving crimes?
[56:20.57]What did you say?
[56:22.51]Wait, hold on.
[56:23.07]I'm hearing machine gun fire.
[56:25.97]Oh, no.
[56:26.59]I don't do crime.
[56:27.79]Yeah, I'm supposed to be like the smart one.
[56:30.81]That can finagle engineering and stuff and get us out of sticky situations we might get ourselves into.
[56:37.40]Oh my god, I'm so good at shooting.
[56:39.22]It's not even funny.
[56:40.18]Yeah, you're the muscle.
[56:44.72]As long as you're the muscle and I'm the brains, we'll be fine.
[56:46.42]I almost got hit by a fucking train.
[56:57.01]What did you say, Jerma?
[56:57.75]I couldn't hear you.
[56:58.33]I'm sorry.
[56:59.03]Oh, I just said I'll be the brains and you'll be the muscle.
[57:01.73]Okay, good.
[57:02.59]I have no brains, so that works perfectly for me.
[57:05.50]I think I just stopped the crime.
[57:10.51]It should be the other way around?
[57:12.49]How?
[57:14.73]No, definitely not.
[57:16.00]Well, actually, I've seen old photos of you, and you are a thought, so... Okay, I have a question for you.
[57:23.84]What's up?
[57:24.86]If you were to pick a Batman Rogues Gallery villain that you would identify with, like, oh, that's me, who would it be?
[57:30.45]I have no idea.
[57:35.64]I mean, I don't know.
[57:37.54]I don't have a good, I don't have a good enough.
[57:39.06]Oh my God.
[57:39.90]This is wonderful.
[57:40.68]Think you like the Joker or?
[57:42.84]No, that's too cliche.
[57:44.32]I feel like everyone always picks that.
[57:47.67]What about the Riddler?
[57:49.71]I like Bane, not Riddler.
[57:51.19]I think Bane is more my speed.
[57:52.79]He was a bit of a, it was a bit of a lefty too.
[57:55.31]Okay.
[57:55.59]Alright, that's a good answer.
[57:57.09]He was just not ideologically pure, but he was close to being a lefty.
[58:01.16]Like, he had the motivation.
[58:03.24]Okay.
[58:04.08]Okay.
[58:05.32]Like, that's, um... I can respect that.
[58:08.68]Okay.
[58:08.92]What would you be?
[58:09.94]The Riddler?
[58:11.81]Um... I would be the person that is selling all the equipment.
[58:16.51]I would want to be the one that was just part of the company.
[58:18.45]Okay.
[58:23.98]Someone said Jerma would be the Mad Hatter.
[58:29.68]Not even the same universe.
[58:30.64]Also, Bane has drip.
[58:31.82]I love the fur coat that he's got.
[58:34.26]San, you are talking over my cutscene.
[58:35.96]What?
[58:36.82]Am I loud?
[58:37.08]I'm just- I'm trying to see what's happening.
[58:38.32]I am trying to literally unlock the mission, but it's not unlocking yet.
[58:40.95]I think I need to solve more crime.
[58:53.49]Yeah, you should have a thing, like a case file thing.
[58:58.16]And it'll tell you, like, oh, there's this you can do, there's this you can do.
[59:00.94]Go solve some stuff in Gotham.
[59:02.38]Yeah, no, that's what I did, but it was like... Wait, hold on, now it's loud.
[59:06.77]Okay, I did that, but then it was like...
[59:10.51]I'm going to lower the audio of the game first because games these days are so loud.
[59:15.91]I feel like an old man saying that.
[59:19.00]Young whippersnapper.
[59:20.94]Out of the four here, who do you think is the coolest?
[59:22.74]Nightwing, Red Hood, Robin, or Batgirl?
[59:26.32]No, Red Hood.
[59:27.94]Nightwing.
[59:29.58]Good answer.
[59:29.98]I was going to leave the call if you said Red Hood.
[59:33.05]What's up with this anti-Red Hood sentiment that I'm hearing from so many people?
[59:39.68]Nightwing's like my favorite.
[59:43.80]I mean, Nightwing's pretty good.
[59:46.10]Nightwing is the original.
[59:52.23]I wonder if I can just like suck you into my game.
[59:54.05]It might be possible.
[59:54.95]Alright, let me read my emails.
[60:06.69]Did you get it?
[60:07.41]No, I think this is the crime I need to solve, though.
[60:10.87]Did I get any new stuff?
[60:12.26]Let me see.
[60:12.62]Ooh.
[60:12.88]I like that one.
[60:13.56]That looks cool.
[60:30.64]By the way, as you play, make sure you check on your gear too.
[60:35.06]You got suits.
[60:36.26]You unlock suits.
[60:36.92]You unlock weapons.
[60:38.42]Oh, yeah.
[60:38.80]I want to change out of the sleeveless hoodie as quickly as possible.
[60:46.45]I have a point I can put in.
[60:47.55]Oh, I have to go to the GCPD morgue now.
[60:51.41]There it is.
[60:51.85]That's the one.
[60:54.71]I can't steal cars though, which is...
[60:58.53]No, you do have access to the Batsicle, though.
[61:01.51]That's true.
[61:04.90]I really do wonder what this game is going to be like in co-op.
[61:08.72]You haven't done it yet.
[61:09.84]So you played the game already.
[61:11.12]You did one.
[61:12.26]Yeah, I played the last couple of days.
[61:13.78]Okay, okay.
[61:17.84]Because I think we can be anywhere.
[61:19.44]This might be incorrect.
[61:21.36]I'm curious, but I don't think it's like, oh, you have to be within like 10 feet of each other or something.
[61:26.65]I wonder.
[61:28.15]Maybe you do.
[61:32.14]Is there a camera?
[61:32.96]Can you turn on camera tracking while you're?
[61:37.24]While you're driving or is that just a product of me playing keyboard?
[61:41.00]Are you playing keyboard or mouse?
[61:41.90]Are you playing controller?
[61:43.40]I would say keyboard and mouse would be in a not ideal way to play this game.
[61:49.35]Are you on keyboard mouse?
[61:52.03]I am.
[61:53.37]Were you playing multiverses on keyboard and mouse too?
[61:56.03]No.
[61:56.35]No.
[61:56.97]No, you weren't.
[61:57.45]I was just bad at multiverses.
[62:01.81]I was just bad at it.
[62:04.59]Where's my car?
[62:06.92]Wait, what?
[62:07.52]Everyone's asking you to hit the Luddy.
[62:12.42]Have you hit the Luddy yet?
[62:14.48]I have not.
[62:14.98]Have you?
[62:16.06]Yeah.
[62:16.26]Oh, yeah.
[62:16.64]I nailed it.
[62:22.01]I'll hit it after this.
[62:27.76]Wait, what weird what?
[62:29.46]So I'm going to.
[62:30.56]I'm not going to start a new story mission.
[62:33.42]Wait, I'm just I'm almost done.
[62:34.90]I'm almost done.
[62:35.54]Yeah, I'm just going to do some.
[62:37.06]Let's do some crime investigation.
[62:39.29]I got here.
[62:39.85]I'm in GCPD.
[62:41.13]There you go.
[62:41.51]Alright, so you're probably like 10 minutes away.
[62:43.83]15 minutes maybe.
[62:47.99]I'll solve a couple of city crimes while I wait for you.
[62:52.87]Alright.
[62:54.53]Are there any?
[62:55.03]There's one here.
[62:55.69]What's this?
[62:58.34]Good thing I don't need to walk in from the front door.
[63:04.72]Wonder why the cops would be on alert.
[63:10.48]Oh, yeah.
[63:11.46]If you cause chaos and mayhem, they get annoyed with you.
[63:17.94]They don't like vigilante justice?
[63:20.53]No.
[63:22.63]It's a dish best served cold.
[63:25.73]Do it a little deeper.
[63:27.87]It's a dish best served cold.
[63:30.53]Can you go even just a little bit more?
[63:33.01]It's a dish best served cold.
[63:35.11]Very good, but less cookie monster, more scary.
[63:38.74]It's a dish best served cold.
[63:41.34]That was close.
[63:41.98]That's as far as it goes, man.
[63:53.38]SCORN.
[63:56.54]Why am I walking?
[63:57.44]I have a car.
[63:58.69]Why am I walking to this?
[64:01.39]Oh, you upgraded from the... from the... Oh, well... Bat-sicle.
[64:06.64]From the Bat-sicle?
[64:09.39]Okay.
[64:09.79]Oh, wait.
[64:10.23]Upstairs door.
[64:10.97]There you go.
[64:11.75]Oh, no.
[64:12.43]Doesn't work.
[64:13.53]Dermot, how do I get into the GCPD?
[64:16.99]Unfortunately, that was three days ago, so it's gone from my memory.
[64:20.62]Nothing goes into long-term memory.
[64:23.64]Actually, I really have no idea.
[64:24.88]Hassan, I don't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday.
[64:27.28]You know what I mean?
[64:28.28]Alright.
[64:28.52]Give me the car.
[64:39.11]Or the... Motorcycle.
[64:41.15]No.
[64:41.49]No.
[64:41.67]I went the wrong way.
[64:45.27]I think he's just literally saying go through the front door.
[64:50.43]You know who I am?
[64:53.32]Someone in my chat said ask him for money.
[65:07.49]He won't remember.
[65:10.01]They really got it out for you.
[65:11.68]I would remember that.
[65:12.40]I don't know, man.
[65:15.30]You say you don't remember what you have for breakfast.
[65:17.56]I like that he said, what am I going to do?
[65:18.98]Go through the front door and I went into the back door.
[65:22.40]I would definitely put a sticky note on like, oh, hey, like Hassan owes me 50 grand or whatever, right?
[65:29.15]I wouldn't sticky note what I had for breakfast yesterday.
[65:40.26]Uh-oh, Jerma, I'm beating cops.
[65:43.38]Like, pretty aggressively and violently.
[65:44.78]I don't know what's going on.
[65:46.74]Oh, the game gets a little nuts.
[65:47.94]I don't know if I'm supposed to be doing that, but I'm beating the heck out of cops right now.
[65:57.34]I want to do the, like, prison mission with you.
[66:00.36]With, like, the... Chat, you guys know.
[66:03.10]With the song.
[66:06.75]I kind of want to be pulled into your game.
[66:16.47]You know the game.
[66:17.11]It's pretty clear how to go to places and yet I'm still failing.
[66:22.09]I already failed the mission.
[66:24.46]No.
[66:25.20]No, no, no.
[66:25.78]Not at all.
[66:29.28]I just went the wrong way.
[66:30.48]I just went the wrong way, Jerva.
[66:35.40]It's okay.
[66:36.06]That's not a bad... That's not a bad guy.
[66:40.43]I was just checking.
[66:41.39]Tactically giving an ocular pat down to the other side of the garage.
[66:48.48]Oh, wait, the bomb's gonna detonate in a minute?
[67:01.08]What?
[67:01.34]Uh-oh!
[67:06.65]Uh-oh!
[67:12.05]This is bad.
[67:34.35]I'm sorry.
[67:34.83]I'm sorry.
[67:35.49]I'm sorry.
[67:36.35]I'm sorry.
[67:36.97]I'm sorry.
[67:38.39]I'm sorry.
[67:39.33]Oh, no.
[67:45.37]Hasan, that was bad.
[67:51.78]I really could have used some muscle there.
[67:54.78]I know.
[67:56.58]Well, luckily, you and everyone else who gets this game by clicking on either of our panels...
[68:03.48]could potentially play cooperative and get all the help that they need.
[68:08.84]Pretty good, pretty good.
[68:10.48]Right?
[68:10.96]Dude, I'm pretty cracked with it.
[68:15.29]Did you... Ahsan, did you happen to tell anybody what platforms this could be on, couldn't be on, you know?
[68:22.97]I did not.
[68:23.87]They're on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, X, and the PC.
[68:30.41]Got it.
[68:34.36]This has been an injury.
[68:35.70]Yeah.
[68:37.76]Yeah.
[68:38.42]Alright.
[68:38.68]Well, there's another one over here.
[68:39.62]So, they didn't stop doing that.
[68:46.46]Oh, wait.
[68:46.88]I am in prison.
[68:47.62]Did you say prison break?
[68:49.00]Or, no.
[68:49.38]It's the bullpen.
[68:51.89]There's a mission after.
[68:52.71]In like another 30-40 minutes from where you are.
[68:55.53]That's just... It's a little wild.
[69:04.20]Okay, let me try to do this again and not mess this whole thing up.
[69:07.94]This seems kind of hard.
[69:15.49]No, you don't.
[69:16.23]Because you're the downed officer.
[69:19.49]Sorry, I'll mute myself.
[69:24.19]Does he see me?
[69:28.61]I don't think... I think he thinks I'm a statue.
[69:46.55]That was awesome.
[69:47.81]Why is this guy Fortnite dancing?
[69:52.03]That's a literal Fortnite dance.
[69:54.04]Alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[70:05.88]you'll be okay alright this mission is kind of hard oh are the freaks gentrifying robin damn it I'm in trouble
[71:07.61]I'm not failing this the second time.
[71:12.93]Thank you.
[71:14.53]You saved me.
[71:19.59]There we go.
[71:24.40]You got here just in time.
[71:26.94]Hey, Belfry.
[71:28.30]Have you heard any reports of the freaks actively recruiting suburban types like soccer moms or guys really into recumbent bikes?
[71:35.58]Please tell me you're kidding.
[71:38.20]So wait, why are they... So some of these people are... They're not... I don't know.
[71:49.17]Alright, cool.
[71:53.78]So I prevented a crime there.
[71:55.08]Good.
[71:57.08]Oh shit, I am not muted.
[71:58.50]I'm just talking through Hasan's stream right now, I think.
[72:01.10]Oh my god, I'm sorry.
[72:02.84]Let me fix that.
[72:06.15]It's like streaming at Hassan's stream.
[72:13.88]Alright, get me out of here.
[72:24.59]So, something going on right here.
[72:26.71]It's okay, Jeremy.
[72:28.03]You're making the stream better.
[72:35.42]in the wrong call.
[72:47.13]Do the wrong Discord bit.
[72:49.45]I'm not going to do the wrong Discord routine.
[72:53.18]It's not possible unless there's more than two or three people in a call together.
[73:00.48]It just being me and Hasan in a call.
[73:06.70]My indicator is just going to light up.
[73:08.36]Whoa, shit, what's going on?
[73:14.06]What are they chasing?
[73:17.22]What are they doing?
[73:19.56]Where are they going?
[73:20.94]I need to see.
[73:21.36]I need to investigate this.
[73:48.10]Oh, new move.
[73:50.99]Oh, that was good.
[73:54.13]I feel like a bow staff would be fun to just like, that would be a good weapon, right?
[74:08.79]So what's going on here?
[74:09.83]What's the actual crime?
[74:17.99]What?
[74:18.49]Somebody trimming hedges?
[74:20.65]Where they shouldn't be?
[74:21.19]What is that sound?
[74:29.22]Okay.
[74:29.48]So, did I do it?
[74:31.62]Okay.
[74:45.67]I think it was those two people that I was chasing.
[74:47.53]I think that's what it was.
[74:51.65]Well, I'll take whatever that is.
[74:55.99]How do I get that?
[75:05.73]There it is.
[75:07.85]Cool.
[75:13.78]Alright, there's an Omega crime going on over here.
[75:18.06]I'll try to do the red Omega crime.
[75:25.56]It's actually going to, you know, it's going to be probably kind of funny watching Hasan like try to do this.
[75:28.76]Because he's just trying to get to the co-op part, right?
[75:32.38]Isn't that the kind of experience that we have here?
[75:50.89]Alright, so what is the issue?
[75:53.07]What's happening?
[75:59.75]What does it say on the map?
[76:03.01]GCPD report.
[76:06.03]Uh, okay.
[76:06.57]So we have to go report to GCPD?
[76:10.21]We have reports of stolen goods being moved.
[76:17.05]Stolen goods being moved.
[76:23.67]Robin is silent.
[76:27.99]Better stay out of sight.
[76:30.71]Alright, so I gotta scan the... What is all that?
[76:33.80]OK.
[76:38.96]Camera control panel.
[76:39.90]Alright, disable those cameras.
[76:41.64]This is a Batgirl mission.
[76:50.49]Oh, come on.
[77:01.70]He's bugging out.
[77:10.59]Oh, wait.
[77:13.91]Where is it?
[77:19.65]Where's the organ?
[77:20.17]Where's the organ?
[77:22.21]You're gonna kick ass now!
[77:27.79]This'll make you feel great!
[77:37.47]Just by a mile.
[77:45.60]Yes!
[77:46.36]You know where I can find some place cold to put this?
[77:49.38]Get out of the way!
[77:50.19]Where do I deliver this to?
[77:51.43]Right there.
[77:52.65]Alright, turn around.
[78:19.20]Where's Sasan?
[78:21.14]He's currently getting to the point where he can play the multiplayer.
[78:39.89]What are you doing over here?
[78:41.25]Wait, what?
[78:42.99]This is bad.
[78:45.27]I gotta turn it in to here.
[78:46.51]I have 17 seconds.
[78:47.81]Make it count.
[79:02.31]Robin, don't do a flourish!
[79:03.79]Oh my god!
[79:18.22]Had to do the flourish.
[79:21.26]You got an expiring organ in your pocket.
[79:23.98]And you gotta do the spin, jump, swing.
[79:26.74]Uh-oh.
[79:33.34]I may have gotten stuck under the sign.
[79:43.38]How did I do this to myself?
[79:47.94]I must have gotten into the perfect... Okay, I can just fast travel.
[80:07.57]I'm playing as Robin.
[80:14.88]Yeah, Gotham Knights.
[80:21.32]There was more to that sentence.
[80:22.52]Oh, we have a cutscene.
[80:26.57]This is a Robin cutscene.
[80:28.19]Let's check it out.
[80:33.77]There's no way the penguin does not double-cross.
[80:36.65]Like, I mean zero percent chance.
[80:38.31]Alright, let's see what this cutscene is.
[80:49.57]Playing with a ghost, Alfred?
[80:56.38]You might say that.
[80:59.36]I'm finishing my last game with Bruce.
[81:03.63]This is just kind of sad.
[81:05.69]I couldn't save our board from the manor, but I do have our notes.
[81:11.62]We tracked each move.
[81:15.16]Alright.
[81:15.38]I think I'm in, I'm in, uh, Belfry tutorial ending patrol.
[81:18.77]I think night one.
[81:21.45]Crime stop zero citizens rescued two.
[81:25.57]I feel like that's more important, you know what I mean?
[81:27.89]What good is stopping crime if you're not saving citizens?
[81:30.03]Oh, there's another mini, another cutscene?
[81:35.21]Yeah, watch that cutscene and we'll, we'll, okay.
[81:41.42]Away.
[81:48.62]Are you winning?
[81:52.15]Playing as Bruce, I can't see how he loses.
[81:59.53]Bruce is dead.
[82:01.96]Maybe he wins your game, but without him, we've lost.
[82:04.58]I'm not so sure about that.
[82:10.44]Not so sure he's dead?
[82:13.62]Not so sure we've lost.
[82:17.36]Bruce played an important role.
[82:20.71]But he never saw himself as the only piece in play.
[82:31.43]I mean, take a little bit of credit, Robin.
[82:33.41]Like, you... You are... You are just as good.
[82:40.14]You are a good superhero.
[82:42.90]And you got your own shit going on.
[82:44.62]And let's, you know, let's watch another cutscene.
[82:46.68]Because this is another one here.
[82:49.82]Is this a bike one?
[83:11.20]Hand me that coolant.
[83:18.72]What's that green slime?
[83:30.56]Did it?
[83:32.91]Hurt, Jason?
[83:36.77]When I fell from heaven?
[83:42.43]When you came back to life.
[83:46.17]Did he just screw that in with his bare hands?
[83:47.75]He didn't even need a wrench.
[83:51.84]It changed me.
[83:57.80]Hey, Lazarus isn't gonna bring Bruce back, Tim.
[84:03.29]Who's to say he doesn't want us to try?
[84:04.97]Oh, he wants to.
[84:08.59]OK, I see what's happening here.
[84:19.37]OK.
[84:22.32]Bruce isn't this bike.
[84:25.42]You can't just change everything out and expect things to work like they did.
[84:35.97]Hmm.
[84:36.13]What?
[85:05.81]Um, he's locked.
[85:11.97]I want that one.
[85:12.79]I want this one.
[85:15.49]I want this one bad.
[85:17.65]I want this one.
[85:18.29]I want this one bad.
[85:20.80]I want this one real bad.
[85:26.44]I want this one.
[85:27.32]How do I buy these?
[85:34.40]I want this one.
[85:37.37]Oh my God, I want this one so bad.
[85:42.20]They're all locked.
[85:50.80]Alright, do I?
[85:53.06]What's next?
[85:56.84]What's the main story mission that I have?
[85:58.30]I have this penguin.
[85:59.54]Penguin is available.
[86:04.69]This Court of Owls thing is available.
[86:08.73]Uh, Dr. Jada Tompkins is available.
[86:11.09]I wonder how close, uh, Hassan is.
[86:17.37]Because I don't want to start something major.
[86:19.65]Hey, what's your, uh, what do you got for an ETA?
[86:23.51]You think you're, uh, pretty close?
[86:26.11]Yeah.
[86:27.35]Uh, I'm talking, I'm having a moment with Alfred right now.
[86:30.06]Okay.
[86:30.26]I'll shut up.
[86:31.04]He's crying about Bruce dying.
[86:33.08]Did you know Bruce Wayne is Batman?
[86:36.20]Uh... I... I mean, I heard that... Did I spoil?
[86:40.12]Did I spoil it for you?
[86:40.88]I'm sorry.
[86:42.28]I don't know.
[86:42.64]Do you mean, like, the billionaire Bruce Wayne?
[86:46.00]What?
[86:47.02]Yeah, billionaire Bruce Wayne is Batman.
[86:48.44]That's what people are saying.
[86:52.16]I... Oh, okay.
[86:54.50]Oh, no.
[86:54.96]Chat's saying major spoilers, dude.
[86:56.76]Damn it.
[86:57.31]I thought, um... No, never mind.
[87:04.51]It's time to craft.
[87:06.66]OK, I need to complete prepare for patrol and complete interrogation training, and I think after that I suspect I will be able to.
[87:13.06]I I guess like I have to complete interrogation training and then after that maybe.
[87:21.30]I think that's it.
[87:24.00]I think that's the one.
[87:24.56]Do it.
[87:25.54]I'm making a legendary slingshot.
[87:31.79]I need I'm trying to upgrade my guns man.
[87:36.84]Yeah, you can go to the workbench when you have a chance.
[87:39.85]You might have something you can make.
[87:40.69]Yeah, it's just gun level one, though.
[87:44.07]Oh, you can switch right here.
[87:45.29]I think it's time to switch to Nightwing.
[87:51.83]Can you pick somebody else?
[87:58.38]Pick a different character.
[88:00.74]Okay.
[88:01.24]Yeah, Nightwing's, like, dumb.
[88:02.73]It's not even, like, a fun... It's, like, Nightwing's, like... I play as Nightwing sometimes, but, like... Usually, I'm the Nightwing guy.
[88:09.19]I'm, like, the Nightwing streamer.
[88:10.91]Oh, you're the Nightwing guy?
[88:12.10]Okay, I'll just keep... I'll stay with Red Hood.
[88:14.42]It's fine.
[88:15.51]No, you don't have to.
[88:16.25]No, no, no.
[88:17.39]It's cool, man.
[88:18.27]No, dude, you don't have to.
[88:19.35]It's my first time playing the game.
[88:20.72]Alright, alright.
[88:22.10]You insist, okay.
[88:24.36]No, yeah.
[88:25.70]Alright.
[88:26.12]Yeah, if you insist.
[88:27.54]I'll just stay with the jarhead haircut.
[88:29.54]It's fine.
[88:30.84]Okay, this says advanced training, ability training, and basic training.
[88:33.20]It says learn interrogation training, but I don't know where that would be.
[88:35.74]Is that in advanced?
[88:37.45]Okay, let me show you.
[88:39.73]So if you go over to the training dummy...
[88:43.21]Go to the training dummy.
[88:44.75]There it is.
[88:45.47]It takes about two minutes.
[88:46.87]And be ready because it's cool.
[88:48.93]Here it comes.
[88:49.29]You're going to go, holy shit.
[88:52.17]Physical and mental pressure go hand in hand.
[88:54.31]Oh, Batman's alive.
[88:56.47]I didn't want to say it.
[88:57.77]Okay, it must not be Bruce Wayne then.
[89:01.78]Because Bruce Wayne is dead.
[89:15.43]Spoilers.
[89:18.18]I think Hasan is very close.
[89:22.76]I think I have enough time to do one more small crime.
[89:26.06]I mean, prevent one more small crime.
[89:29.41]That's better.
[89:36.11]Wait, that's it?
[89:37.27]I just said, tell me what I want to know.
[89:39.13]And he said, Kat, don't got this tongue.
[89:41.27]I'll tell you what you want to know.
[89:42.55]Scan the drone.
[89:43.01]Where is it?
[90:05.37]Where's this drone that he's talking about?
[90:15.76]Oh, my God.
[90:16.26]Batman said I've come so far.
[90:17.58]Okay.
[90:20.63]So when I exit.
[90:21.71]Oh, no.
[90:22.05]Now I can play multiplayer.
[90:23.29]There it is.
[90:25.21]Hold on.
[90:25.59]Let's switch over.
[90:26.99]Let's click on multiplayer.
[90:28.57]Oh, is this quick match?
[90:31.57]Main story, heroic assault.
[90:34.18]Main story, right?
[90:35.56]I would assume, yeah.
[90:37.00]I think that's a worship, maybe.
[90:38.02]Waiting to join.
[90:38.88]Are you just joining me?
[90:41.66]I don't know.
[90:42.10]Did you host me?
[90:43.86]No.
[90:45.02]It said joining host.
[90:46.64]Did you just join a random game?
[90:48.46]I don't know.
[90:51.28]Who, man?
[90:52.00]Wait, what?
[90:53.61]I've joined a random person.
[90:55.03]You're in a random person's game?
[90:56.67]I don't know how that happened.
[90:59.79]Oh, because I think you did quick play.
[91:02.78]Did I?
[91:04.16]I think, hold on, let me investigate this.
[91:05.90]Let me do some investigation here.
[91:11.94]Oh, I should go to social, game invites, friends.
[91:15.44]There it is.
[91:17.38]Theme friends.
[91:18.46]There it is.
[91:21.10]And then you... Yes, can.
[91:25.34]Wait, did I actually accept your friend request?
[91:27.74]I thought I did.
[91:28.78]Did you not?
[91:29.20]I didn't.
[91:31.23]Awkward.
[91:33.15]But you didn't accept my friend request.
[91:35.33]I just accepted it.
[91:37.50]Yeah, because you were forced to on stream.
[91:40.40]Oh, that's awkward, man.
[91:41.26]That's kind of whatever.
[91:42.52]I guess I'll just join you right now.
[91:44.98]I might as well.
[91:48.56]Sorry about that.
[91:52.96]Oh, there you are.
[91:53.86]Oh, hold on.
[91:56.74]Not showing on my end yet.
[91:57.96]Hold up.
[92:00.46]Did it not work?
[92:02.84]Oh, I'm here.
[92:03.46]There you are.
[92:03.76]Gas can has joined the chat.
[92:06.36]OK, I gotta come find you.
[92:09.42]Yeah, you are really far away.
[92:11.84]Wait, really?
[92:12.42]We can look, look.
[92:13.48]Yeah, but look at how far away we can be.
[92:15.28]I don't think it's going to tether.
[92:18.11]No.
[92:19.55]I'm Robin.
[92:22.11]Oh, OK, that is way drippier.
[92:24.15]You look like Legend of Zelda Robin.
[92:26.47]I look cool.
[92:28.50]You do.
[92:29.08]The other Robin looked so... Do you know about the other character in the game?
[92:33.49]There's a bunch of characters here.
[92:35.31]I'll show you one.
[92:35.75]There's a... What's his name?
[92:40.19]Watch out.
[92:41.91]Who's that?
[92:42.71]What's his name?
[92:44.19]Bald Boy, right?
[92:44.85]I forgot.
[92:47.22]Wait, what is this?
[92:48.68]It's Bald Boy.
[92:49.38]It's another Batman hero.
[92:52.38]How did you change your character so swiftly?
[92:55.18]You don't know who Bald Boy is?
[92:58.74]No.
[92:59.54]You wait.
[93:03.52]You know who Batman is, but you don't know who Bald Boy is?
[93:06.92]Oh, who's Bald Boy?
[93:08.01]That's... Alright, you're trolling.
[93:09.53]Does a train ever come?
[93:10.57]Like, I feel like we'd get cooked if a train just decided to... Wait, where are you going?
[93:16.67]Alright, who's mission are we on?
[93:19.13]Are we on mine or yours?
[93:20.92]No, it would be yours, I think.
[93:22.78]Alright, so let's go... Let me mark something.
[93:26.36]Let's do...
[93:28.60]Wait, I can change my suit style in menu?
[93:32.66]No, I can't.
[93:33.50]I think I'm about to spoil like the first third of the game for you, by the way.
[93:37.57]It's okay.
[93:37.97]Because we're about to go talk to a certain character.
[93:42.33]I'm down to do the mission with you.
[93:43.83]Alright, let's go.
[93:44.81]Do we both have bikes?
[93:46.35]Seems like you need the help.
[93:48.14]Oh.
[93:50.26]Or wait, do I get on your back?
[93:51.84]I don't know.
[93:52.20]Let's find out.
[93:54.30]it won't let me uh do you have to have your own oh you have your own bike I wish I could just like yeah I wish I could mount your bike with you alright let's go you gotta ride a wheelie the whole time that's part of it okay we're like the whoa
[94:20.40]This is the reason why Eric Adams said, no more motorbikes in New York City, by the way.
[94:25.83]Because of this kind of behavior that we're engaging in.
[94:29.95]You're doing pretty good.
[94:30.69]It's a little political joke.
[94:33.25]A little political humor.
[94:34.47]Was that a political joke?
[94:36.39]Yeah.
[94:36.69]I don't know.
[94:40.41]Where are you going?
[94:43.17]Excuse me?
[94:44.65]I'm in the water.
[94:47.81]Save me.
[94:48.51]You just used me as a jump.
[94:51.02]that was pretty cool I did that on purpose actually that was sick alright you might thought that I was actually scared but really I was just doing it as a joke I love how you're you're in character hell yeah wait uh hold on hold on I think I'm gonna turn you up let me I'm gonna go to gear I'm gonna go to gear oh my god I can change my suit
[95:14.51]Let me turn around a little bit.
[95:16.04]You got a better suit?
[95:17.52]Beyond suit?
[95:19.50]We both look like henchmen of... What does the red hood beyond suit look like?
[95:32.13]Pretty cool.
[95:33.81]I think I've seen it.
[95:34.25]Alright, so we're going to go over here.
[95:38.18]So hop off the bikes.
[95:38.88]We're going up here.
[95:42.47]And we're going to visit a particular character.
[95:45.41]Where are you?
[95:53.27]I don't know what I just did.
[95:55.29]Where are you?
[95:55.85]We gotta go in the ceiling.
[95:59.80]Oh god.
[96:09.06]What?
[96:10.15]I can't get to you.
[96:11.09]I don't know why.
[96:11.77]No, you're right here.
[96:12.65]You're right here.
[96:13.99]I know, but let me jump up there for some reason.
[96:18.71]So, yeah, jump right down here.
[96:21.01]There you are.
[96:22.61]Alright.
[96:24.41]Just duck and roll, baby.
[96:27.11]He's just right here.
[96:27.83]Whoa, what?
[96:30.13]Dude, spoilers.
[96:30.87]Watch out.
[96:31.15]Watch out.
[96:32.36]He's got grenades and shit.
[96:33.14]Watch out.
[96:34.60]Wait, really?
[96:35.00]No.
[96:38.81]Oh.
[96:39.19]Are you seeing this cutscene?
[96:41.67]No, I'm just hearing him talk to you.
[96:45.78]Can you walk behind me?
[96:46.64]Like, get behind me.
[96:47.24]Like, will you just appear in the cutscene?
[96:51.90]I'm behind you.
[96:52.22]No, you're not there.
[97:02.04]You misunderstand me, friend.
[97:04.09]As the owner of a respected establishment, I have an interest in keeping the streets safe.
[97:10.63]You could help.
[97:12.57]What's your angle?
[97:14.21]Are you hoping I'll take out some of your competitors?
[97:16.06]Speaking of angles, you should probably angle the umbrella up.
[97:18.68]I'm not in the crime business anymore.
[97:20.08]So you don't get rained on.
[97:21.14]So if I came across any unusual gear, I'd be obliged to turn it over.
[97:26.98]Upstanding citizen that I am.
[97:30.01]You're lucky they're criminals.
[97:32.73]I wouldn't even consider it.
[97:34.91]Well, that's the spirit.
[97:36.47]You're working with crimers?
[97:39.09]Sometimes you have to work with information.
[97:43.02]That's my response to you.
[97:44.22]You see that?
[97:45.00]What about my response?
[97:48.44]Wait.
[97:48.58]Do you see my emotes?
[97:51.04]Wait.
[97:51.20]I don't... What are you?
[97:53.86]Rock, paper, scissoring?
[97:54.84]I don't get it.
[97:55.52]Yeah.
[97:55.74]Alright.
[97:56.00]Let's rock, paper, scissor.
[97:57.92]So if you select emotes and then do... Good job.
[98:00.06]Good job.
[98:01.34]Wait, I can't do another emote?
[98:04.90]I don't think I have rock, paper, scissors.
[98:08.65]No.
[98:09.53]Alright, so now we have to go from here.
[98:13.39]And... Okay.
[98:17.61]Kind of rude of Mr. Penguin not to even acknowledge my existence, but that's okay, I guess.
[98:22.38]I love how his name is Mr. Penguin.
[98:26.11]That actually makes him way less intimidating to me.
[98:30.09]Oh, Mr. Penguin.
[98:31.47]Mr. Penguin to me is like an actual penguin.
[98:33.33]It's like the animal with the stripe on his stomach and stuff.
[98:36.73]Mr. Penguin.
[98:37.77]That's not the penguin.
[98:39.12]Penguin is scary.
[98:41.66]Wait, this guy's not the penguin?
[98:43.60]No, he is, but like you called him Mr. Penguin.
[98:46.94]Yeah, Mr. Penguin was my father's name.
[98:51.10]I'm just a regular old penguin.
[98:52.92]Alright, where are we going?
[98:54.08]We're going to go this way.
[98:54.74]We're going to do the owl stuff.
[98:57.34]I'm going to lie.
[98:58.94]This is giving Spider-Man a little bit with our suits.
[99:02.46]I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.
[99:04.89]That's a different franchise entirely.
[99:06.53]This is Gotham Knights.
[99:07.53]This is the DC Universe's Gotham Knights starring Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and of course, who could forget Red Hood?
[99:16.78]Alright, we should get on a bike.
[99:20.48]Alright, get on the bike.
[99:20.98]Here.
[99:22.56]So we're gonna go through here.
[99:23.46]I'm curious how the gameplay is.
[99:29.70]With two people.
[99:33.85]So what difficulty are you playing?
[99:35.95]I was on hard, but I was kind of getting my ass kicked so I put it to normal.
[99:40.43]Oh yeah, I'm on medium.
[99:41.67]The big enemies are horrible.
[99:46.83]If you play the game on hard, the huge enemies, they just they're so tanky.
[99:50.37]They're really difficult to kill.
[99:52.47]Alright, we're going right into this building up here.
[99:55.41]So we're going to find a secret door.
[99:58.40]Do you have this on the map?
[100:00.70]I think I found the secret door.
[100:01.56]Did you?
[100:01.72]Hammer right here.
[100:02.12]Oh my God, I think you actually found it.
[100:16.48]We need to take out the cameras.
[100:18.30]How do you take them out?
[100:19.90]If you hold left trigger, you can aim and then you can use right trigger to shoot.
[100:24.29]Good to know.
[100:29.23]Alright, I'm turning this off.
[100:33.14]Wait, crime resolved?
[100:34.10]Secret identity compromised?
[100:37.06]What?
[100:37.24]That might even be a side mission.
[100:40.12]Thanks for helping me complete my side mission, Hasan.
[100:43.02]That's crazy.
[100:43.92]I just compromised someone's secret identity.
[100:45.54]It's kind of messed up.
[100:47.78]He just doxxed.
[100:48.98]I think we have to go down the front door.
[100:53.14]Wait, no way.
[100:54.60]Oh, God, I'm falling.
[100:56.34]Look what I found.
[100:58.66]This looks pretty secret, doesn't it?
[100:59.88]This is a secret door, I think.
[101:01.31]Open this.
[101:02.55]I suggest it to you.
[101:04.67]The host.
[101:06.69]I mean, I am Robin.
[101:07.55]I'm an engineer.
[101:13.96]Wait, who did you say that to?
[101:15.32]Why are you speaking to yourself in the third person?
[101:17.46]Whoa, chill!
[101:18.38]PvP, let's go.
[101:20.48]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[101:23.46]Fucking double agent for the owls.
[101:25.20]I mean, I'm shooting the heck out of you right now, so...
[101:30.25]Alright, let's go in.
[101:34.83]You have other suits in the styles tab?
[101:36.41]Wait, hold on.
[101:37.52]Let me look at it real quick.
[101:41.16]Oh, there's different colorways?
[101:43.02]Stop playing with me.
[101:48.16]You have points to put in too.
[101:49.50]Have you looked at the skill tree?
[101:53.98]Nice.
[101:54.82]Oh, the shinobi one!
[101:56.22]But transmog suit is locked.
[101:59.54]Strange location for it.
[102:01.64]Any indication of what they were doing there?
[102:04.96]I'll see what I can find.
[102:06.18]Okay, these suits are sick, but it won't let me... I can only get... I can only apply a transmog to the new guard?
[102:15.17]I don't know what that means, but... I can't get... I can't get night ops or shinobi.
[102:24.05]I think I need to craft different gear.
[102:28.72]This one's fine for now.
[102:32.88]Are you good?
[102:34.84]Alright.
[102:37.58]I'm good.
[102:37.92]Gas can.
[102:38.52]I think we have to solve this.
[102:41.00]Probably a puzzle in here.
[102:42.98]Oh, this isn't this isn't the mission.
[102:45.60]Yeah, this is.
[102:47.38]Oh, it is the mission.
[102:48.24]OK, letterbox.
[102:49.89]We should probably look for to scan some documents here.
[102:53.49]Moreno.
[102:54.91]I feel like I know that name.
[102:56.53]Me too.
[102:57.23]Case file?
[102:57.65]That's what would happen if you gave a camera to a monkey.
[102:59.89]I actually think a monkey would probably turn the camera and just be like taking pictures in its face.
[103:21.83]I'm investigating this.
[103:23.31]The west end, this peg points east towards the hospital.
[103:26.99]Okay.
[103:27.55]This peg points northeast.
[103:30.91]Interesting.
[103:31.39]There's a OFAE SAIDA card.
[103:33.51]This tends to appear to be in Old English.
[103:35.49]AR scan analysis indicates.
[103:37.49]Excuse me?
[103:37.79]OFAE SAIDA means purge.
[103:40.05]The rest of the text says, kill all those who trespass.
[103:43.25]This image matches the one on the second order.
[103:47.18]Alright, so... means threaten.
[103:49.28]The rest of the text says, make them fear us.
[103:51.74]What we need to figure out is we need to figure out where the target is and what the instructions are.
[103:57.46]And you have to piece two pieces of evidence together.
[103:59.32]Do you think we can handle that?
[104:01.85]Okay.
[104:03.55]There's another one that says, kill the target.
[104:06.85]And then there's one that says, which means constrain or confine.
[104:10.39]The rest of the text says, take them prisoner.
[104:12.49]Okay, so we're going to try kill the target.
[104:15.49]And what do we know so far?
[104:18.35]I have no idea what this mission is.
[104:20.21]I'm supposed to be the brains.
[104:21.05]I'm supposed to be the brains.
[104:22.11]That's my bad.
[104:22.51]Yeah, you're supposed to be the brains.
[104:23.47]What's going on?
[104:24.25]There's an owl dagger here.
[104:25.43]Maybe we use that to kill the target.
[104:27.53]I think they're going to use the order to kill.
[104:33.36]They want to kill somebody at Gotham River.
[104:35.72]I messed up.
[104:36.76]I spilled coffee all over my controller for a second.
[104:39.62]I didn't mean to do that.
[104:41.38]The order is to kill
[104:46.89]see symbols are different from the previous document but it seemed to indicate a command and a location okay it looks like there's a kill there and it looks like that location is possibly I would have deduced this the order is to purge because the swords line up there purge the river thank you very much brains of the operation
[105:17.34]Okay, what happened?
[105:18.61]Looks like the court gave a purge order to the Chelsea Tunnel.
[105:22.77]So by the way, I'm not going to fight any enemies.
[105:25.01]That's for you to do.
[105:28.79]That seems convenient.
[105:30.51]The Court of Owls must have something hidden down there.
[105:34.03]Heading that way now.
[105:36.17]You could have just like walked.
[105:39.33]No, I rule in style.
[105:43.56]What's your favorite Batman?
[105:47.24]Dude, I don't know.
[105:50.98]I mean, obviously the Dark Knight is, you know, that's got to be up there, right?
[105:55.58]I know that I didn't like the last one.
[105:58.83]I didn't even see the last one.
[106:00.95]That's crazy.
[106:01.95]I really probably wanted to.
[106:03.33]It's very angsty.
[106:05.73]I think the original Batman cartoon...
[106:08.02]Bro, you are cooking right now.
[106:09.58]I don't know how I'm not able to go as fast as you.
[106:12.54]Oh, alright.
[106:13.00]So right before you land, it's going to say, oh, jump.
[106:16.68]You essentially want to time it.
[106:17.70]So maybe like a half second before you land.
[106:20.08]Oh, no, I got it.
[106:21.02]Yeah.
[106:23.20]Alright.
[106:23.54]So what is down here?
[106:24.52]I got something here.
[106:30.26]Lower level, maybe.
[106:35.58]What are we looking for?
[106:39.04]The court went to great lengths to halt construction at the Chelsea Tunnel.
[106:42.66]Investigate the construction site to uncover what they... This is like level... We're kind of under level for this, but whatever.
[106:48.13]We can do it.
[106:49.25]Dude, you got me on your side.
[106:51.97]I'm the greatest carry.
[106:53.45]That's true.
[106:53.71]Don't you worry about a thing.
[106:54.71]We have to find the entrance in here.
[107:00.73]Maybe lower?
[107:03.79]I'm going one step further.
[107:04.97]Oh, it's the tunnel.
[107:06.47]Okay.
[107:10.27]I think it's the tunnel.
[107:11.55]Yep.
[107:16.03]I want to see how your combat prowess.
[107:17.47]I want to see how good you are at this.
[107:19.01]Oh no.
[107:19.57]Secret entrance.
[107:28.80]Easy looks accurate, right?
[107:32.72]Here we go.
[107:33.34]That's pretty sick.
[107:34.32]Alright, they say we miss you buddy.
[107:37.96]Would it?
[107:43.19]Oh, here it is.
[107:47.10]I've suggested it to you, the host.
[107:49.48]I think we, yeah, we can teleport in.
[107:59.57]Between the two of us, we can figure this out.
[108:02.34]I'm in the tunnel.
[108:03.95]Looks like they hit some kind of chasm during construction.
[108:07.13]We're going to fight like aliens or something.
[108:08.71]We'll lose comms down there.
[108:10.11]I'll check in.
[108:11.87]They want me to ask if you're the sus guy.
[108:14.59]You already knew that.
[108:16.57]You're the sus guy, right?
[108:17.63]Yeah, you knew that.
[108:22.95]Alright, so I think we're probably going to end up fighting a bunch of stuff down here.
[108:27.64]Oh.
[108:29.12]OK, I'm ready.
[108:31.06]I'm I got the Glock in the Rari 1738.
[108:34.98]It's stalking me.
[108:36.80]I don't think it's human.
[108:37.60]It's the last message of this phone received.
[108:39.68]OK, I'm going in.
[108:40.83]You stay out there.
[108:41.97]You stay safe soldier.
[108:44.91]I hate tight spaces because I'm such a big muscly guy.
[108:48.51]I have no idea if I'm going in the right direction.
[108:57.45]I you are.
[108:58.19]I think so.
[109:00.35]You're the brains of this operation.
[109:01.69]I'm just the brawn.
[109:08.94]Okay, cutscene unlocked.
[109:10.64]Do you have a cutscene too or is that just me?
[109:12.44]Yeah, I'm watching you.
[109:13.54]Yeah, I just saw that weird alien person.
[109:16.70]Okay, where are you?
[109:20.30]Whoa!
[109:20.86]Watch out!
[109:25.62]You're ugly.
[109:31.79]He's like a Bloodborne villain.
[109:32.97]I thought you were good.
[109:33.61]You just got knocked down by a random putty.
[109:37.84]Okay, that was a cutscene, okay?
[109:39.76]You just got knocked down by a putty from the Power Rangers, dude.
[109:42.16]Come on, man.
[109:47.53]Oh, God.
[109:47.95]Okay, I can't even land a hit on him.
[109:52.19]Come on, get him.
[109:53.35]You gotta... What?
[109:56.81]He's dodging everything, Jerma!
[109:58.21]I mean, are you pressing X?
[110:02.29]Press X and you gotta string X together.
[110:06.40]Wait, press X?
[110:07.30]Yeah, X. What does X do?
[110:08.54]X, X, X, X. What does X do?
[110:12.82]It's just a punch.
[110:13.68]No, no, X is like on the swing.
[110:15.32]Oh, no, I'm not on the controller.
[110:18.39]You almost got him.
[110:18.85]You almost got him.
[110:22.01]Why is he hitting me?
[110:24.29]I don't know.
[110:24.71]I'm just trying to find an opportunity when I should come in.
[110:27.15]I was going to let you fight the first enemy.
[110:28.37]I can't get a single hit on him.
[110:33.57]It's because I'm on a keyboard, I think.
[110:35.21]That's why.
[110:35.69]You probably need to plug a controller in.
[110:36.81]Let me try.
[110:37.27]Let me try to hit him.
[110:42.71]Okay, so I don't know what was wrong, but my game was fine.
[110:49.00]See?
[110:49.52]I'm ranged.
[110:50.08]I'm ranged.
[110:50.42]This is what we were supposed to be doing.
[110:51.98]Yeah, I mean, my game seems to be working fine.
[110:54.46]Yeah, yeah.
[110:54.88]No, no, no.
[110:55.32]It's just what we were... See?
[110:56.25]We did it together.
[110:57.41]I just hit ranged attacks, and that's how we were supposed to do it.
[111:02.57]Yeah, the guns probably are better.
[111:03.52]Yeah, yeah.
[111:06.30]That's what it was.
[111:07.04]That's what we were doing.
[111:10.80]We're probably going to have to fight a lot of those.
[111:21.25]Wait, that was just a regular creep?
[111:23.07]That wasn't the boss?
[111:25.23]I don't think so.
[111:26.85]Uh-oh.
[111:28.05]Are they behind us?
[111:32.73]I look so much less intimidating next to you while you have guns and I have a slingshot.
[111:36.03]Yeah, you have a slingshot, dude.
[111:37.81]What is that?
[111:38.41]Hey, watch this, you know?
[111:39.63]Are we going to get on the other side somehow?
[111:43.12]Is there a way to go up?
[111:49.24]Oh.
[111:54.73]Yeah.
[111:56.95]Some parkour?
[111:59.29]Parkour!
[112:02.46]Nice!
[112:02.84]Okay, we should be all done.
[112:11.53]Very nice.
[112:12.03]Alright, be careful.
[112:22.81]I'm never careful.
[112:24.09]Oh, also, you're playing keyboard mouse, right?
[112:26.73]Yeah.
[112:27.49]In the lower left, you probably already know this, but there's a button to just do an instant like 30% heal.
[112:31.99]Yeah, Z. Okay, yeah.
[112:34.58]I want to make sure you... Oh, no.
[112:36.54]I've been abusing it.
[112:37.38]That's why I'm still alive even though I... Uh-oh.
[112:59.87]Are you going to play this again tomorrow?
[113:01.63]Uh-oh.
[113:02.47]I am not.
[113:03.50]I will not be playing this tomorrow.
[113:04.82]Oh, no.
[113:05.34]Who's going to carry me tomorrow then?
[113:07.10]Oh, no.
[113:10.40]Bro, I can't even hit him.
[113:11.90]I'm not even kidding.
[113:12.66]I don't think I can hit him.
[113:16.14]I think I might be too low.
[113:17.73]Yeah, I'm doing like 22 damage.
[113:19.15]Yeah, try holding the heavy attack button.
[113:23.49]That should stun them and then you can hit them.
[113:27.31]I wonder if there are other combo moves.
[113:33.32]Want to see something cool?
[113:35.44]Check this out.
[113:40.61]Oh, God.
[113:43.49]They're very good at dodging my projectiles.
[113:47.23]Yeah, these characters, you hold the heavy attack button.
[113:50.67]Whatever your ranged attack button is, hold it.
[113:52.54]Oh, God, I'm dead.
[113:54.02]I got you.
[113:54.34]Don't worry.
[113:55.02]I'm respawning at two.
[113:57.30]One.
[113:58.58]I can't pick you up.
[113:59.74]Why?
[114:00.04]No, I have to do it myself.
[114:05.55]Wait, what?
[114:06.27]Where do I respawn?
[114:07.77]Okay.
[114:07.87]Come on.
[114:18.07]We can't lose to the putties.
[114:24.87]I killed one.
[114:25.57]Nice job.
[114:26.07]Let's go.
[114:26.57]Alright.
[114:27.45]Hold on.
[114:34.26]That's... That's for me.
[114:36.05]Alright, let's do... Can we do a pose?
[114:36.97]Let's do a pose together.
[114:39.17]On the count of three, let's do your favorite emote on the count of three because I want a picture.
[114:43.23]Okay.
[114:44.11]You ready?
[114:44.45]Let's do it.
[114:45.59]I'm ready.
[114:46.25]One, two, three.
[114:52.21]That's fucking cool.
[114:53.20]Hold on.
[114:53.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[114:55.64]I actually look so cool right now.
[114:57.90]You do look very cool.
[115:03.39]I want a better frame.
[115:04.11]There we go.
[115:08.74]Perfect.
[115:10.38]Nice.
[115:11.28]Nice.
[115:13.02]Alright, but what's your range attack button?
[115:16.95]uh right click and then left click or q for ranged attacks or that one hold q for yeah hold q for heavy attack so that one you want to that's the only way you can hurt these guys oh we really yeah so you have to hold it hit somebody with it and then they stunned enough for you to do the melee damage to them
[115:38.25]Okay, got it.
[115:39.49]Uh, they are also level 9 and I'm level 3.
[115:41.99]That's also true, yeah.
[115:43.33]You are kind of underleveled for this.
[115:44.95]So am I. What am I, 7?
[115:47.23]6?
[115:51.02]People are yelling at me saying it was on my screen.
[115:56.48]Need my attention.
[115:57.22]Alright, almost up there.
[116:01.32]These guys got nothing on us.
[116:11.20]It's actually not a bad impression.
[116:15.86]Actually sounds pretty good.
[116:19.02]I'm going to find research items.
[116:22.76]It's my job.
[116:25.00]Very good at finding research items.
[116:28.90]I think these are the research items.
[116:32.11]This is some 9 slim Jim's.
[116:35.07]This is a spectrographic analyzer.
[116:38.33]Spectrographic analyzer.
[116:42.38]I got a chest over here.
[116:45.26]I've never even seen a chest yet.
[116:46.70]Did you get the item?
[116:49.76]I think I got some green stuff.
[116:56.15]Yeah, it's crafting material.
[116:57.63]So eventually you have enough to make new weapons and suits and stuff.
[117:02.57]Seems like we need to open up this extraction room.
[117:05.63]I think we have to find two more pieces of research.
[117:10.71]Which it looks like over here.
[117:12.39]Oh, no, it's back here.
[117:16.09]What's this stuff?
[117:18.05]More X-ray analyzer and more ore samples.
[117:22.00]Is this going to be an insanely hard?
[117:23.42]This looks like a difficult puzzle.
[117:28.54]Where did you go?
[117:29.56]What are you doing?
[117:30.36]We opened it.
[117:31.00]That's it.
[117:31.42]Oh, it's down a level.
[117:32.82]There was a rock climbing wall.
[117:38.54]Oh, whoops.
[117:43.67]Rookie mistake.
[117:44.95]It's not a big deal.
[117:47.79]I'll keep us grounded.
[117:50.07]Oh, I fell.
[117:52.33]By grounded, I mean literally in the ground.
[117:55.21]Rookie mistake.
[117:58.19]I'm the new Red Hood.
[117:59.49]Where are you?
[118:01.63]What?
[118:03.45]That was pretty sus.
[118:09.52]Oh, my God.
[118:10.46]I fell again.
[118:16.34]Alright, you made it.
[118:17.76]You made it.
[118:18.22]I think the game got sick of you falling and just put you there.
[118:29.91]Computer from a crown to all.
[118:32.53]I did some tinkering and went back to some older composite samples.
[118:35.89]Turns out what we thought was waste or just needed a different extraction treatment.
[118:39.95]The carbonic acid.
[118:41.31]They're just making words up now.
[118:43.30]Carbonic acid.
[118:44.62]Carbonic?
[118:47.02]Nerd stuff.
[118:47.80]Don't worry about it.
[118:48.72]Hey, I'm a nerd here.
[118:50.44]Come on.
[118:50.98]Alright, so this is... These samples have got to tell me something about what's going on here.
[118:55.94]Oh, it's another piece together the mystery.
[118:59.90]Alright, I'll leave this up to you, the brains of the operation.
[119:02.84]Which sample should be placed in the extractor?
[119:05.14]Which chemical will extract material from the sample?
[119:07.84]Interesting.
[119:09.22]Hmm.
[119:10.90]Well, this is composite ore, which the holes in it would indicate that it's already been extracted.
[119:16.28]So, I don't think it's this one.
[119:19.02]Hmm.
[119:20.40]A note on the sample reads, reacts poorly to all previous extraction methods.
[119:24.58]No sample extracted.
[119:25.16]I think it's marble 1063.
[119:29.13]Um, what?
[119:29.85]I don't know.
[119:32.35]I just wanted to say... Oh, you clicked on this one already.
[119:34.21]Alright, so we need to actually figure this out.
[119:39.46]So, which sample should be placed in the extractor?
[119:41.44]This one, no.
[119:42.60]It's already been used.
[119:44.62]I hate science.
[119:48.92]And... Can you back away, Red Hood, a little bit?
[119:50.96]Your breath is fucking awful.
[119:53.46]Listen, didn't have time to brush my teeth before we ran outside today.
[119:58.77]No sample extracted.
[120:01.35]Hasn't been extracted yet.
[120:03.31]This one here.
[120:05.43]Which chemical will extract material from the sample?
[120:14.00]I didn't think you'd be able to smell my breath from under the mask.
[120:29.72]Hmm.
[120:31.10]How do I find what the element is?
[120:33.74]Which chemical?
[120:37.65]Which chemical would it be?
[120:38.71]How do I select it?
[120:47.08]Okay, if you can't figure it out, then there was no shot I was going to figure it out.
[120:50.86]You're the nerd on this team.
[120:52.36]Stop, stop, stop it!
[120:55.10]Uh, where's the... I'm trying to work, Red Hood!
[120:59.45]Which chemical will extract material from the sample?
[121:01.25]Is that a mechanical keyboard?
[121:02.65]Seems like a real gamer.
[121:04.07]WASD keys are actually highlighted.
[121:06.31]I wish Batgirl was here.
[121:07.57]I wish Batgirl was here instead of you.
[121:10.49]Uh, what chemi... I can't put any chemicals here.
[121:17.29]Is there a list of the chemicals?
[121:18.69]I don't see them anywhere.
[121:19.95]I think that was a bit mean.
[121:21.63]What you just said right there.
[121:22.73]I mean, the breath thing is fine, but... You know how I feel about Batgirl.
[121:31.99]Where's the list of chemicals?
[121:34.39]Maybe the email?
[121:35.71]Yeah, I can't click the email.
[121:38.39]Sulfuric acid worked perfectly.
[121:40.21]Is sulfuric acid here somewhere?
[121:42.86]Oh, Jesus.
[121:45.83]It's alright, Red Hood.
[121:46.47]I got this.
[121:47.69]Uh, we just didn't look one inch to our left.
[121:50.57]Uh, that's my bad.
[121:51.15]I'm supposed to be the brains.
[121:52.49]Um.
[121:53.33]Yeah.
[121:54.49]By the way, I apologize for everything I just said about, uh, you know, telling you to get away from me and everything.
[121:58.12]Are you loving this as much as I am?
[122:01.10]No.
[122:02.36]I'm not.
[122:05.10]Ugh.
[122:06.40]I got it.
[122:06.94]Okay.
[122:07.08]We're good.
[122:09.06]I was just about to shoot this nerd thing.
[122:15.15]Dionysium.
[122:17.29]That sounds made up.
[122:19.75]Oh, good.
[122:20.63]I'm not the only one who hasn't heard of it.
[122:24.99]We should get another photo.
[122:25.57]Everyone wants me to say this.
[122:26.78]I don't know why.
[122:27.74]SCORN.
[122:29.40]You shouldn't have said that.
[122:30.94]Why?
[122:31.22]Just saying.
[122:32.96]You've infected your channel now.
[122:36.42]Wait, what?
[122:36.96]With what?
[122:37.82]SCORN.
[122:39.46]Guys, there's a new SCORN streamer here.
[122:42.36]He's in the call right now.
[122:45.80]I've never played that.
[122:48.47]Well, now you have to.
[122:50.13]I'm actually playing... Gotham Knights.
[122:59.03]A brand new open world third person or action RPG featuring the Batman family.
[123:04.33]You can step into the roles of Batgirl, Nightwing, Red Hood and Robin and rise up as the new protectors of Gotham City in the wake of Batman's death.
[123:12.48]You can also customize your night with new gear and looks as you play through all the new original story solo or an online co-op with a friend.
[123:20.87]Like Jerma.
[123:21.63]Like we're doing right now.
[123:22.93]Like we're doing right now.
[123:24.49]And come face-to-face with some of the most infamous villains in DC's Batman universe, such as Mr. Freeze, Harley Quinn, spoiler alert, Clayface, and mysterious Court of Owls.
[123:35.59]Gotham Knights is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, X, and the PC.
[123:40.71]It really looks like your character is sitting there talking into a camera.
[123:45.36]Yeah.
[123:45.96]Right there.
[123:46.32]Because he is.
[123:50.35]But everything you just said was true.
[123:51.95]Is there a co-op experience?
[123:52.80]Batman is dead.
[123:53.80]And also he's Bruce Wayne.
[123:58.12]There's an absolutely amazing part.
[124:00.34]I don't know if you'll see it or whatever.
[124:02.16]But I forget how far into it it is.
[124:03.46]But it's absolutely hilarious.
[124:04.32]It's probably the best part of the entire game.
[124:06.56]So Batman sends an email.
[124:09.55]This is a spoiler, by the way.
[124:10.41]But it's hilarious.
[124:11.49]So Batman sends an email out to all the Gotham Knights.
[124:15.00]He's like, oh, hey, I just want to make sure everyone's aware of this.
[124:18.46]It seems to be that Bruce Wayne and Batman are Google trending right now.
[124:23.16]So I feel like people know who I am.
[124:25.72]He actually says that search trending, like he's trending as Bruce Wayne and Batman.
[124:30.18]He's a bit of a boomer.
[124:33.15]Yeah, but that was like my favorite part of the entire game so far.
[124:36.02]There's nothing wrong with being a boomer.
[124:38.26]Alright, let's go.
[124:39.58]He looks up his name and Batman and sees that like the trend line for searches has gone up.
[124:44.43]So he's like, oh shit, I've been compromised.
[124:46.85]That's how he knows.
[124:49.73]Suggesting that to host.
[125:04.82]There's everything wrong with being a boomer?
[125:08.04]Wait, what do you mean?
[125:09.04]Are you saying that?
[125:09.60]Wow, that's messed up.
[125:10.93]They're being ageist.
[125:11.79]They're being ageist.
[125:12.51]Uh-oh.
[125:18.07]Dog.
[125:18.27]You're a dude in an owl head.
[125:32.73]We are the protectors, not you.
[125:34.59]What?
[125:34.83]You're just bats.
[125:37.41]Well, that's a load of shit.
[125:46.80]Don't you think he'd want to press that when you leave?
[125:49.38]Yeah, doesn't that hurt his own owl, guys?
[125:54.26]Yeah.
[125:56.10]Where am I in the cutscene?
[125:57.46]I'm not in the cutscene!
[126:01.30]I pressed it so, oops, we gotta get the fuck outta here now.
[126:03.90]Are you ready?
[126:05.78]Yeah, I'm gonna do the Q thing now.
[126:12.78]Alright, we gotta do superhero talking to each other, like in every movie.
[126:17.03]Okay, I'm not able to use the- oh shit, oh god.
[126:20.05]Red Hood, 6 o'clock!
[126:22.97]Bullseye!
[126:26.41]Ah, that was mine, man!
[126:27.57]I died.
[126:33.32]I can't help you up.
[126:34.98]Wait, I can respawn.
[126:36.16]I don't know why.
[126:36.80]It wouldn't let me, though.
[126:39.66]Oh, I'm good.
[126:40.00]I'm good again.
[126:41.00]I respawned.
[126:42.83]Oh, God.
[126:43.53]Okay, they're spawn camping.
[126:51.77]Oh, my God.
[126:52.01]These guys are kind of tough, actually.
[126:55.11]Oh, God.
[126:55.41]I'm going to fall.
[126:58.00]There's a button prompt and I don't know what button it is.
[127:00.40]It just flashes way too quickly.
[127:03.17]It's dodge.
[127:04.41]So you see like when their hands kind of light up with a circle around it.
[127:07.59]When the circle lights up, that means you can do a perfect evade.
[127:10.10]Actually, I don't think you can put the point in.
[127:11.44]No, that's not it.
[127:24.79]There we go.
[127:25.39]Okay, I have to actually right-click because it doesn't auto-aim.
[127:29.56]Possibly because of the PC.
[127:31.38]Probably.
[127:31.80]Wait, what was that?
[127:32.72]What is that?
[127:33.18]The Ghost of Nightwing?
[127:34.34]What the hell?
[127:36.50]No.
[127:38.90]What, do you got a spirit bomb?
[127:41.36]What is that?
[127:42.16]The Ghost of Nightwing.
[127:47.23]Nice job.
[127:47.87]Oh, you killed him.
[127:49.03]I killed him, actually.
[127:50.27]That was me.
[127:54.49]Uh-oh.
[127:55.93]We're going down, man.
[127:56.89]We're going down.
[128:01.11]We're going down, Goku.
[128:04.01]Well, I guess they're going down with us.
[128:12.27]No, we're good.
[128:21.45]Not in the cutscene, Sag.
[128:27.75]I think I'm just about done with talons, thank you.
[128:32.63]The mines are collapsing.
[128:33.79]We must escape.
[128:37.76]This is not what I was expecting to be for our Saturday afternoon.
[128:41.24]Are we running?
[128:42.02]I'm running.
[128:43.64]I'm not fighting.
[128:44.60]I'm running.
[128:46.74]Hey, when we get back, promise me you'll do the cooking.
[128:50.59]Is that you talking or is that Robin?
[128:52.59]What?
[128:54.49]I've been like saying hi to the chat for like a minute or two.
[128:58.35]Wait, it just says like when we get back, promise you'll do the cooking.
[129:02.77]Hi.
[129:04.61]I was muted.
[129:10.35]Wait, is that actually him?
[129:13.87]Yeah.
[129:20.38]Am I being gaslit right now?
[129:21.98]That is pretty sus of you, dude.
[129:23.96]Yeah, I was being kind of sussed.
[129:27.64]Damn, you were sussy.
[129:32.82]Wait, can you do that again for real?
[129:36.24]It has to be in the moment.
[129:37.76]I'm a method actor.
[129:40.71]Blocked.
[129:41.61]Of course.
[129:42.71]Stupid cave-in.
[129:45.07]I hate cave-ins.
[129:51.09]Guess we gotta go up now.
[129:54.12]Okay.
[129:54.50]That was a bad line.
[129:57.20]I'm sorry.
[129:59.80]And I didn't even do it right.
[130:00.86]Okay.
[130:02.32]Okay.
[130:03.13]Okay.
[130:03.69]Who the hell am I?
[130:04.81]Alright.
[130:06.55]Let's switch roles now.
[130:07.63]You do Robin and I'll do Red Hood.
[130:09.59]I can't do Robin.
[130:13.71]I think I can probably do a pretty good Red Hood.
[130:15.55]I sure hope so.
[130:17.63]Okay.
[130:18.23]That sounds very scorned like.
[130:21.62]Maybe a little.
[130:25.77]Why do you sound hungry?
[130:31.55]Oh, up here.
[130:32.13]I'm up here.
[130:32.83]I'm looking forward to chopping those carrots later on.
[130:35.46]It's a long ride up.
[130:38.54]Shut up, Robin, you fucking idiot.
[130:44.06]Listen, Red Hood, just because you're so sexy and muscular doesn't mean you can bully me like that.
[130:50.98]Oh, well, I have to see.
[130:52.04]But I like it.
[130:53.24]We did a really good job together.
[130:56.65]You sound a lot like that conspiracy guy, Alex Jones.
[131:00.09]I just want to tell you, but you need to understand.
[131:02.69]No, listen to me.
[131:07.98]Belfry, can you hear me?
[131:09.18]When we get back to the Belfry, I'm going to eat as much meat as I can.
[131:13.76]I'm going to eat.
[131:14.56]I'm going to have children.
[131:16.02]The court is mining this strange element I've never heard of.
[131:18.77]Here we are.
[131:20.01]We have you.
[131:22.39]Hello?
[131:24.15]Are you still there?
[131:26.80]Oh no, where's Belfry?
[131:28.20]How are we going to go back?
[131:35.12]Whatever you do, do not punch this person.
[131:37.06]Don't do it.
[131:37.64]I'm telling you right now, you better not.
[131:39.98]Where?
[131:40.90]Down.
[131:42.17]This guy?
[131:43.15]You better not.
[131:44.19]Don't do it.
[131:44.67]You're under arrest.
[131:47.83]Stop.
[131:48.61]Actually, stop it.
[131:50.03]Stop it.
[131:51.05]Stop.
[131:51.39]I'm getting out of here.
[131:51.95]What do you mean?
[131:52.47]I'm getting out of here.
[131:53.03]This is not on my stream.
[131:54.05]I'm out of here.
[131:55.61]I thought you told me to punch the person.
[131:58.19]I said don't.
[132:02.14]I misunderstood.
[132:05.82]You tell me to punch.
[132:06.68]I say how hard.
[132:10.97]Alright, we're gonna go talk to Talia al Ghul.
[132:16.51]I'm a bit of a anti-hero.
[132:18.05]No, you know what?
[132:18.65]Let's do, um... Oh, my game just turned off.
[132:21.68]Oops.
[132:27.34]What?
[132:27.60]Are we still on the call?
[132:30.28]Yeah.
[132:30.64]Okay.
[132:32.44]What?
[132:33.06]I'm going up.
[132:34.54]I think I'm gonna have to join you.
[132:36.22]Wait, are you still in my game?
[132:40.53]Wait, I just lost connection to the game session.
[132:44.49]Yeah, I think it just booted us, I think.
[132:48.80]Wait, why did that happen?
[132:51.64]Okay, well, on that note, I think, I mean, wait, hold on.
[132:58.17]When did you start playing?
[132:59.11]I don't know, like a couple hours ago.
[133:03.65]Oh, okay.
[133:04.49]Do you want to keep going?
[133:05.85]Because I was just going to... Are you done?
[133:08.79]I was going to end it here.
[133:11.39]Oh, okay.
[133:12.91]Yeah.
[133:16.01]I'm going to play for another 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
[133:19.94]I'll play more with you.
[133:22.50]Do you want to keep playing?
[133:23.82]Yeah, I'll play 20 more minutes.
[133:25.62]Let's do at least a couple of crimes on the street.
[133:29.54]Wait, I wonder if it's because I shot the civilians.
[133:32.14]No.
[133:38.10]Let's do a little bit more.
[133:38.76]You come with me this time.
[133:39.92]You come with me on a mission.
[133:40.85]Alright.
[133:41.19]Yeah, that's probably better because then I can actually carry because I'm going to be like four or five levels higher than you.
[133:47.85]Okay.
[133:48.87]So let me go to social.
[133:50.43]Wait, why isn't it showing up on recent?
[133:52.17]Oh.
[133:52.58]Friends.
[133:54.06]In-game friends.
[133:54.90]It doesn't say.
[133:55.48]Are you offline?
[133:57.18]No.
[133:57.62]Hold on.
[133:58.80]I'm just.
[134:01.62]Are you offline?
[134:03.04]No.
[134:05.91]Can you invite me?
[134:07.55]You're not showing up on my list.
[134:12.80]Oh, no.
[134:13.24]It says, okay, invite player.
[134:15.62]Oh, there you go.
[134:18.34]Invite Gascan to your game.
[134:20.40]Let's go.
[134:20.99]Did it work?
[134:23.35]Can you hear me?
[134:25.29]I mean, I invited you.
[134:27.21]I wonder if it was through Steam.
[134:30.53]Yeah, it's through Steam, friends.
[134:32.59]Okay, coming in.
[134:36.66]Yeah, let's play for like another 25, 30 minutes or so.
[134:38.72]20 minutes.
[134:39.04]I mean, you know, Warner Brothers is obviously sponsoring the stream, so let's showcase what we can, you know what I'm saying?
[134:49.96]Hey, there you are.
[134:51.11]God, you look like such a freaking nerd.
[134:59.97]Little guy.
[135:00.65]Okay.
[135:02.65]Wait, can you change your casual gear?
[135:04.79]I don't think you can change the casual gear.
[135:10.08]this is your game so am I still level I'm still level eight so oh my god the talon gear is soon wait I have different demon I have different ones here oh no I don't shinobi no no it's the same ones as you level up you unlock more suits and stuff oh how do I get to this one
[135:38.79]I actually like that when I do the decoy, the elemental residue sounds pretty cool to me.
[135:46.12]I'm going to take a look at the workbench here.
[135:49.84]You should.
[135:50.18]I don't have a serious shoot.
[135:52.90]I don't have anything for suit.
[135:54.44]I only have stuff for melee.
[135:57.72]Like I can craft a stealth pistol.
[136:01.96]And I'm doing all that, but I want to do it so I can, like, actually change my suit, but I can't.
[136:06.86]It only says apply transmog.
[136:08.54]Does that mean it's unlockable?
[136:12.21]Alright.
[136:12.55]So does it say crafting ready underneath it?
[136:16.13]No.
[136:16.79]No.
[136:16.99]So you probably don't have enough materials.
[136:21.07]Chad, why are you guys saying you have other gear to equip?
[136:24.65]Okay.
[136:25.21]Get out of this.
[136:27.60]And just hold down whatever to get to that menu.
[136:30.50]F1.
[136:31.68]And go to gear.
[136:33.20]Just out of the workbench.
[136:34.78]And then go to suit.
[136:36.44]And then go to melee.
[136:37.42]It's the same thing, but you probably have a couple things to switch out.
[136:43.91]Okay, suit.
[136:45.47]I have the beyond suit on.
[136:48.73]You might have other guns too.
[136:54.21]Last hurrah.
[136:54.73]Yeah, I'll do nightwing last hurrah.
[136:57.68]It's my favorite character.
[137:01.62]I want to play more Batgirl, though.
[137:02.66]Batgirl's cool.
[137:07.21]Oh, your stats are being decreased to match the hose.
[137:09.63]They are.
[137:10.89]Oh, shit.
[137:11.49]Okay.
[137:12.53]Well, I mean, that makes sense, but... Yeah, that makes sense.
[137:18.78]Okay, I have a stock suit and a beyond suit.
[137:20.72]That's it.
[137:22.66]On gear.
[137:23.16]That's the only two things I have.
[137:27.53]And I guess I can try this with different styles.
[137:32.29]I've been waiting to do this ability.
[137:34.03]This is gonna be awesome.
[137:45.62]Hold on.
[137:47.66]OK, Batman's last case.
[137:49.78]Weird science.
[137:50.56]Should we do that one?
[137:51.36]Is that what you want to do?
[137:53.00]Yeah, we could even just walk around the city and just do like the kind of random events.
[137:58.56]I feel like that would take about 20 minutes or so, not like 30, 40 minutes.
[138:03.47]Okay.
[138:05.17]Wait, hold on.
[138:06.19]Melee.
[138:07.77]We might actually have to be out for you to put new stuff on.
[138:12.79]I wonder if I can craft something.
[138:20.56]I cannot.
[138:25.26]I guess I can't.
[138:32.15]Oh, I have the beyond suit now.
[138:36.22]I think you were.
[138:36.94]I think you were in that before, were you?
[138:38.94]Yeah, but it just like it changed it.
[138:41.38]Oh styles.
[138:51.20]I can do new guard.
[138:53.70]On the beyond suit, that's it.
[138:58.59]I can't.
[138:59.01]I can do Nightwatch.
[138:59.99]I mean, I like Nightwatch.
[139:01.17]It's fine.
[139:02.51]I want Shinobi, but it won't let me.
[139:04.13]And Night Ops, I can't.
[139:09.85]Metal is sick.
[139:10.73]Privateer.
[139:11.47]Demon.
[139:12.01]Neon.
[139:12.53]Noir.
[139:14.07]Batgirl, he's talking to himself again.
[139:17.20]No, I'm talking to you as well, but... Batgirl, I don't... I mean...
[139:28.84]who is he talking to I was talking to you do people say that in your chat all the time yeah after you go on like you talk for like 10 straight minutes people just go like who is he talking to who are you talking to alright let's try to do a crime you know what I mean shopping again that's what he's doing that's true I am shopping I do be shopping a lot
[140:01.65]you just say let's do a crime I meant yeah you know what I mean you meant let's stop a crime okay Batman's last case you don't want to do that you want to do just regular huh um I'm I'm down for it I think it'd probably be easier it'd be less time if we did just the stuff on the street okay you you lead the way then or do I have to lead the way I think because you're the host I think you might have to lead the way
[140:27.16]OK, there's a difficulty low.
[140:29.36]Let's do a higher difficulty one.
[140:31.22]There's only one.
[140:32.06]There's only two crimes here.
[140:33.42]Difficulty normal faction mob.
[140:35.86]Yeah, like and then there's a another low difficulty kidnapping in process.
[140:44.81]OK, that's 473 meters.
[140:46.19]Maybe we should take our said that way.
[141:05.89]Alright.
[141:13.27]Okay, never mind.
[141:14.41]This was a very easy way to traverse long distances.
[141:18.45]There's a shootout happening downstairs.
[141:22.71]I think we should cover it.
[141:24.15]Coming.
[141:32.53]Alright.
[141:32.79]So where's it at right here?
[141:34.38]Underneath us?
[141:35.02]Yeah, it's down here.
[141:36.26]I'm going to engage in an aerial attack.
[141:38.38]Let's go for it.
[141:40.58]Wait, what?
[141:41.28]Oh, these are cops.
[141:43.36]What?
[141:45.06]I'm beating up cops.
[141:46.02]I don't know why.
[141:46.66]Wait, wait, wait.
[141:47.06]What happened?
[141:47.64]Wait, this is not the robbery.
[141:49.47]Is this a robbery?
[141:52.27]Why are we beating up cops?
[141:53.47]I don't know.
[141:54.63]You came down here.
[141:56.35]What's the mission?
[141:57.17]They're so strong.
[141:59.25]Hold on.
[142:00.85]They have stuff over here.
[142:04.74]I'm shooting the wrong thing.
[142:09.42]Dude, I have ice moves.
[142:24.43]Why are we doing this?
[142:25.79]I don't know.
[142:27.25]Just go with it, I guess.
[142:34.45]Ah.
[142:36.21]It's the next street over, Hasan.
[142:40.22]Oh, God.
[142:46.50]Oh, you killed him.
[142:49.98]It's the next street over.
[142:51.60]I think we helped the cops out.
[142:53.14]I mean, I think we helped the crimers out.
[142:54.76]I think that's what may have just happened.
[142:56.97]It's possible.
[142:57.55]Alright.
[142:59.35]This one is right over here.
[143:02.27]Get up.
[143:03.41]Down this way.
[143:07.29]Sorry, but when I go to an address, asses need to be whooped.
[143:12.69]Alright, so take a look down here.
[143:14.62]We've got it.
[143:15.12]We've got it.
[143:16.90]Try not to get spotted.
[143:20.92]Okay, I'm hiding currently behind the mailbox.
[143:25.00]Where you at?
[143:27.73]Gone.
[143:30.72]Are we doing an aerial attack?
[143:32.24]I'm gonna wait for you to go in and then I'll go in too.
[143:34.06]And by the way, silent takedowns.
[143:36.77]And try to be undetected.
[143:39.23]Gonna be a little hard.
[143:43.71]Okay.

[144:20.29]I'm trying to get to that right now.
[144:21.55]Trying to get to a better position, a better perch, so I can do an aerial attack on the other one.
[144:26.30]What just drove by?
[144:27.70]Something just flew by the screen.
[144:29.56]Okay, I got a silent takedown.

[145:27.24]Just keep them distracted.
[145:28.06]We'll get it.
[145:34.24]It doesn't count.
[145:39.49]Nice.
[145:41.13]There's one more.
[145:41.63]Alright, we got it.
[145:43.45]Crime solved.
[145:44.73]We got it.
[145:45.21]Let's make sure to check on this person.
[145:46.47]Make sure they're okay.
[145:47.65]Are you alright, sir?
[145:49.11]Thanks, hero.
[145:50.27]Might be a good idea to head home.
[145:53.13]Yeah, get out of here.
[145:55.27]I'm shooting it in his vicinity, so he's like afraid.
[145:57.85]You know what I mean?
[145:59.57]Wait, yeah.
[145:59.93]Give him a swift kick in the ass.
[146:02.71]That's right.
[146:03.29]Get out of here.
[146:06.05]Teach you something about trying to meddle in criminal affairs.
[146:13.35]Alright, I'm ready.
[146:17.86]Okay, we solved that crime.
[146:19.10]That was pretty easy.
[146:20.08]I mean, God damn, that was pretty soft crime.
[146:22.94]Yeah, felt pretty good.
[146:27.03]So, there's one 212.
[146:29.78]Let's do this hard one.
[146:31.76]This one, Steven, 263.
[146:32.56]Wait, how do you... Where is it?
[146:34.52]So, I don't know what it is on yours, but... Okay, on the bottom left of your screen, whatever the rightmost ability is, is to see what's around you.
[146:42.11]Like the AR mode.
[146:46.25]No, it's not...
[146:51.02]Yeah, for me, it's down on the D-pad.
[146:52.84]It's on the lower left of your abilities.
[146:54.66]We're heal and call the bike and emote.
[146:57.61]On the map, you mean?
[146:58.55]No, just like the lower left of your screen.
[147:01.13]Like whatever that button is all the way to the right above your health bar.
[147:04.97]Oh, I see it.
[147:06.47]160 meters away.
[147:07.47]Purple.
[147:07.83]Is that the one?
[147:08.57]Yep.
[147:15.16]Oh, well, is it?
[147:16.50]A hundred and...
[147:19.35]Where is it?
[147:20.35]It's this, I think.
[147:21.41]I think I just waypointed it.
[147:22.85]Hold on.
[147:23.63]Whatever the one is red.
[147:24.41]It's a red one.
[147:25.51]Oh, it's a red one, not a purple one.
[147:27.49]Okay.
[147:28.11]I did the wrong thing.
[147:30.00]I wonder what the purple one even means.
[147:32.28]Red one is 256 meters away.
[147:34.40]Red, does that mean it's hard?
[147:35.88]I think that's a difficult one.
[147:39.12]Wait, let me look at it real quick and then try to pinpoint it on the map.
[147:43.82]Oh, yeah.
[147:44.28]It says difficulty very low.
[147:47.83]Very low.
[147:49.42]Yeah.
[147:52.60]Let's go to the purple one.
[147:53.85]We'll do the purple one.
[147:56.05]I don't know what that means though.
[148:01.26]But again, thank you, Warner Brothers, again, for sponsoring this segment of the stream.
[148:05.44]It's out now.
[148:06.48]Right.
[148:06.84]Both of our panels down below should have an image with a link.
[148:11.00]The game is currently on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, Series X, PC.
[148:17.45]It's out now.
[148:18.01]It came out yesterday.
[148:18.87]Wait, it's down here?
[148:22.71]There is co-op, as you can see.
[148:25.61]Oh my god.
[148:28.79]Are these criminals or are they just trying to get in their car?
[148:32.20]I don't know, but you're having a hard time whooping that ass.
[148:34.68]I see.
[148:35.06]I did alright.
[148:37.43]Oh, they were trying to break into a car, I think.
[148:40.85]Good thing we were here to solve that crime.
[148:43.13]I feel like that was kind of overkill.
[148:47.45]It's like, oh, they're breaking into a car and all of a sudden it's like you got us two here with like our superpowers.
[148:53.25]Like just throwing ice at people and shit.
[148:57.05]I don't think that was the purple one.
[148:58.26]Oh, no.
[148:58.54]Yeah, it wasn't.
[148:59.12]I was going to say that was not...
[149:02.13]There's one over here.
[149:03.25]I thought it was.
[149:08.49]Right here.
[149:12.41]Oh wait, it's not.
[149:14.09]I'm still going.
[149:17.74]We can do this really quickly.
[149:20.02]I'll go for a stealth kill and you go for a silent takedown from above.
[149:33.97]You just like Mario jumped on his head.
[149:39.90]That's right.
[149:42.30]That was not a purple one, was it?
[149:43.86]That was the purple one.
[149:45.88]No, I think there's another purple marker on mine.
[149:53.65]Difficulty low.
[149:54.21]Let's do a hard one.
[149:56.18]I don't, there isn't any, like, it's not, I have no hard ones.
[149:59.70]Oh, I think, yeah, because we're low.
[150:01.82]Let's do the one that is right.
[150:04.00]Let's just do this one then.
[150:05.40]This is called the Freaks.
[150:06.94]I have it marked.
[150:08.22]And we can call it for this if you want.
[150:10.24]Okay.
[150:11.70]Lead the way.
[150:13.06]Been a lot of fun playing with you, dude.
[150:19.86]Absolutely.
[150:20.98]Anytime.
[150:28.81]Alright, so I don't know what exactly this is, but we'll find out.
[150:32.45]We're about to find out.
[150:41.78]I did say it back.
[150:42.84]Why is chat saying wait?
[150:43.94]Did you not hear me?
[150:45.34]No, I did.
[150:45.72]Yeah, I said absolutely anytime I heard it.
[150:50.94]I had a lot of fun too.
[150:54.84]Alright.
[150:55.14]So this is one of them.
[150:56.90]That's why I was begging him.
[150:59.98]Literally.
[151:00.46]Whoa, two stars.
[151:01.66]I mean, you can tell that story if you want.
[151:06.50]Jerma was like, no, I don't want to play with you.
[151:07.86]You suck.
[151:08.51]You're bad at the game.
[151:11.09]And I was like, please, Jerma.
[151:13.37]I need you.
[151:13.93]Aerial attack time.
[151:15.77]Aerial attack doesn't kill people, which is weird.
[151:21.03]Wait, why are cops shooting at me now?
[151:25.15]Alright, let's get him.
[151:29.03]Did cops shoot you in your game too?
[151:31.69]They did, but I ran somebody over with my car.
[151:33.81]So, I mean, it made sense.
[151:37.43]I was running people over.
[151:39.03]I was attacking people.
[151:40.71]Okay, now I'm hitting these cops and they're not actually doing anything.
[151:44.88]I was driving into people and shooting at them.
[151:47.70]It was a disaster the first time I was in this room.
[151:50.54]I played it for the first time.
[151:57.49]Damn.
[152:00.95]Whoa, chill bro.
[152:02.07]Cops are shooting me too.
[152:07.89]Are they still mad at you?
[152:09.69]No.
[152:10.73]I think they were accidentally shooting me.
[152:13.85]Hey!
[152:14.35]Oh no!
[152:16.51]Wait, they're running away.
[152:17.53]Run away!
[152:18.19]Get out of here!
[152:19.10]Get!
[152:22.16]That's how I clear an area though.
[152:23.58]It's just like my signature move.
[152:28.60]Okay.
[152:28.74]Alright.
[152:29.50]You want to do one more or are you good?
[152:31.29]Oh, it's up to you.
[152:32.17]I'll do one more if you want to do one more.
[152:33.57]You need to put the guns down.
[152:36.09]I will never put my guns down.
[152:38.01]America, damn it.
[152:39.11]It's Gotham.
[152:40.81]I mean, I don't know what this one is, but we can go to it.
[152:43.35]Let's do it.
[152:43.67]Somebody just called you out.
[152:48.41]Yeah, she did.
[152:55.34]What?
[152:56.28]Okay.
[153:01.08]So this one looks like... Is that the previous one that we just did?
[153:07.45]I think... Maybe we didn't get rid of them all.
[153:11.93]No, it cleared it for me.
[153:28.09]Oh, she has an AK.
[153:29.11]Let's go.
[153:29.75]This one's a little bit more challenging.
[153:31.89]Just kidding.
[153:33.25]Whoa.
[153:33.75]Watch out.
[153:34.17]She's aiming for you.
[153:40.68]Yeah.
[153:41.46]Team attack.
[153:42.12]Team attack.
[153:42.68]Team attack.
[153:43.16]Come over here.
[153:44.44]Team attack.
[153:46.20]Oh.
[153:46.68]Oh, that was sick.
[153:50.98]Yeah, that was sick.
[153:51.56]Let's do it again.
[153:54.08]Aw.
[153:54.26]I'm just getting warmed up.
[153:57.02]Damn it.
[153:59.55]That's pretty cool.
[154:05.71]Alright.
[154:06.11]How you doing?
[154:06.87]Are you good?
[154:08.51]I'm good.
[154:08.99]Yeah.
[154:10.62]Alright, Jerma.
[154:11.14]Thank you so much.
