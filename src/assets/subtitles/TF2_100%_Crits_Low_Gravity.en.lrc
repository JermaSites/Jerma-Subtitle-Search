[00:02.12]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:04.00]Jerma here with a gameplay commentary on Team Fortress 2!
[00:08.42]Gonna be playing with the Soldier, the Scout, and the Engineer in this gameplay, and before I get into ANYTHING, take a look at the screen, holy crap!
[00:17.91]This is on a 100% crit, low gravity server, and before anybody freaks out, let me give you a little bit of a reason why I'm doing this.
[00:27.59]So I know we had that talk the other day.
[00:30.06]The Team Fortress 2 is dying talk.
[00:32.90]Had a lot of good responses, you guys had a lot of good discussion from that, and a lot of it got me thinking.
[00:38.68]I think it's time to try some custom maps, some custom mods, some interesting game modes, that type of thing, and that's why I'm doing this.
[00:46.64]This is a real, incredibly, radically different experience than playing normal Team Fortress 2.
[00:53.47]If you've never done something like this before, absolutely go try it.
[00:57.15]It is some of the most fun I've had in this game in a very, very long time.
[01:02.90]Now not only did this server have low gravity and 100% crits, it also had a dice mod on it.
[01:10.15]And that adds another layer of insanity on top of this cake of craziness we're making here.
[01:16.55]And just in the beginning for the first couple minutes I wanted to show you some crazy one lives or crazy situations I got myself into.
[01:23.89]Scout and Soldier, the next thing after this Scout run I have right here, which is ridiculous, I kill a bunch of people, but the gameplay after this, the Engineer, it's a full gameplay.
[01:33.64]I'm gonna commentate over it, tell you some things, but holy crap, words can't even describe what you're going to see.
[01:40.36]So if you happen upon one of these servers at some point in the near future, which class should you play?
[01:46.87]Now that's a good question, and the easiest answer is definitely the Scout.
[01:52.43]The Scout can move around so fast and double jumping, you can pretty much fly around the map like a flying squirrel.
[01:58.78]It's ridiculous.
[02:00.16]And if you're gonna use Scout, oh my god, the hitscan weapons, not just for Scout.
[02:04.98]If you use a hitscan class and you're good, you will dominate an entire server, especially with the Scout.
[02:13.54]If you can jump around and land your shots really well, get some good meat shots on people, you will kill everybody.
[02:20.74]So here is the end of the scout run, I get this last soldier, and then we're gonna transition into the engineer gameplay.
[02:27.55]Starts from the beginning, and oh my god, use the Widowmaker.
[02:33.21]If you get into a game that's a server like this, oh my god, use the Widowmaker.
[02:37.97]That's the only thing I can say.
[02:39.39]Because watch this, guys.
[02:40.95]With the Widowmaker on a 100% crit server...
[02:44.41]You will have infinite ammo, because when you shoot somebody, you get almost all of your ammo back.
[02:50.68]Once you hit one person, you'll get at least, at least double or triple what you put in.
[02:57.14]So as you can imagine, you can stand in a corner like this, or get in a long corridor, and just fire away and just smoke everybody that walks down a hallway.
[03:08.61]And as for the Mini Sentry, I think I only place maybe two, maybe three in the entire gameplay, and they don't kill one person.
[03:17.68]I kill every single person in this gameplay with the Widowmaker, and it gets to a point where I stop placing it, because it's wasting my metal to shoot people.
[03:26.76]I go, you know, I could place a Mini Sentry right here, but...
[03:29.92]Who cares?
[03:30.86]I'm not gonna do that.
[03:32.28]And this part right here is great.
[03:33.42]Look at this.
[03:33.77]You know the world is upside down when an engineer kills a heavy from 500 feet away.
[03:40.29]Just unbelievable.
[03:41.71]And you know it's crazy when it happens again.
[03:44.67]Right here.
[03:46.80]World ending now.
[03:49.00]2012.
[03:49.16]Is it 2012 yet?
[03:50.34]No, it's not.
[03:50.84]It's okay.
[03:51.78]Demoman Skeet shooting right there.
[03:53.72]He launched about 5 million feet in the air and I ended up catching him with a little pellet and he died trying to sticky jump.
[03:59.61]I think he was trying to jump across the map, which is crazy effective because one sticky bomb will launch you across the entire map.
[04:08.12]I was actually messing around with it before I captured some of this footage.
[04:11.65]It's kinda like getting shot out of a cannon.
[04:14.57]You kinda feel like Evel Knievel when you do it.
[04:18.09]Oh, I almost forgot to bring this up.
[04:19.71]Somebody told me about a new winter crate.
[04:22.41]So I did a little research, went to the wiki page, went to go find out for myself.
[04:26.75]Now I am excited for the winter update, because last year, if you guys were around, last year when they did this whole crate key winter thing, there were a bunch of new items and new weapons.
[04:38.72]So hopefully this is part one of the saga that is the Christmas update.
[04:44.88]Just wanted to get that out there, because I know I would have forgotten that.
[04:47.92]And I would have, three days from now, would have been like, did I mention the crate key?
[04:51.87]Oh, damn it, I didn't.
[04:54.05]That kind of sounded like Grandpa.
[04:56.55]by the way speaking of grandpa I know I'm going off on a wild tangent right here but this kinda has to be said I got a lot of PM's and a lot of comments from people asking me where's grandpa is there any more grandpa videos what's going on with that and I gotta I'm gonna say it one more time make sure I reiterate this to the new people that came in a lot of new guys have come into the channel so grandpa is gonna be every Sunday 4 p.m.
[05:18.55]pacific time on machinima respawn
[05:21.08]Grandpa will appear on this channel at some random times.
[05:24.32]I'll do random games with him.
[05:26.06]This is a gameplay commentary channel, though.
[05:28.16]If you're looking for just straight-up craziness, I do other weird characters, too.
[05:32.74]I have a whole playlist that's dedicated to my real-life skits, like Burgah Boy, The Egg, and stuff like that.
[05:38.88]You guys that have been in the channel for a while know, but if you're new to the channel, go check out the playlists.
[05:43.20]A lot of Grandpa stuff is there, and some other characters you may not have heard of yet.
[05:47.45]But that is where the comedy is gonna go in that playlist.
[05:51.19]That is going to wrap up this commentary on the crazy 100% crit low gravity server.
[05:57.13]Thank you all so much for watching.
[05:58.56]I really do appreciate it.
[05:59.94]If you like this video, go ahead and shoot me a like, and I will see you guys all next time.
[06:04.28]Take care, everybody.
