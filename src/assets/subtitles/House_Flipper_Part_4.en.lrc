[00:02.00]Alright, let's get one thing straight before I'm seeing a lot of PogChamps.
[00:04.76]I'm seeing a lot of venuses.
[00:07.04]I'm seeing a lot of Venus- Before you PogChamp, this ain't even real.
[00:12.97]This is an uploaded video.
[00:14.65]I want to make sure you're aware of that before we get started.
[00:17.13]I have a super streamer switch, which if there's an internet problem for more than four days, a video is uploaded and broadcast as it was live.
[00:28.92]I'm currently crying in bed.
[00:32.05]Tears are streaming down my face because the internet problem has still not been fixed.
[00:37.29]So hopefully this little tidbit of content will be worth a little bit for you.
[00:44.20]Can you hear me crying?
[00:46.40]Well, you can't because this is recorded.
[00:48.86]Hey, how is everybody?
[00:54.20]Alrighty.
[00:58.97]No, we are live.
[00:59.59]This is live.
[00:59.99]This is real.
[01:01.27]But, I'm gonna be really honest with you.
[01:03.18]I haven't even tweeted this.
[01:05.68]This is a, let's see if it can stay on, kind of moment here.
[01:12.64]I don't believe you?
[01:13.26]Alright, I'll stop reading names.
[01:14.54]221111, thanks for the comment there.
[01:24.27]Six two one one two one three three.
[01:27.07]Thanks for that comment.
[01:28.67]It's a good one.
[01:33.06]This is pre-recorded.
[01:34.10]It says one two two two one one one zero zero.
[01:38.72]Thank you.
[01:49.15]Nobody said that.
[01:53.36]Nah, how you guys doing?
[01:57.26]I'm turning into a goblin.
[01:59.21]I really am.
[02:00.95]We're gonna relax for a minute here, and I'm not gonna turn the webcam on, because I look like shit.
[02:07.35]You wanna see a goblin?
[02:09.61]Would you like to?
[02:16.49]I'm not sure if I'm, like, comfortable.
[02:17.77]This is, like... This is essentially me turning the webcam on naked.
[02:25.43]I haven't looked in the mirror in like seven hours.
[02:28.12]I have no idea.
[02:28.88]I have dog hair all over me.
[02:30.94]I probably look like such a psycho.
[02:34.74]Alright, are you ready?
[02:36.10]Alright, fine.
[02:36.78]Are you ready?
[02:37.28]Let's see.
[02:39.81]Let's see.
[02:40.67]I don't know what I look like.
[02:41.39]I have no idea.
[02:42.77]Full screen.
[02:48.07]One.
[02:49.63]Two.
[02:51.10]Three.
[02:53.02]No, I look okay.
[02:54.72]Look at this.
[02:56.34]Look at, like, I have so much dog hair all over me.
[02:58.82]Oh, I know.
[02:59.52]Oh, no, I look bad.
[03:04.35]I look okay.
[03:08.39]Eyes look a little tired, though.
[03:12.15]Not lipstick.
[03:13.15]Not this time, see?
[03:15.93]I'm very tired.
[03:17.75]It's been a long three days.
[03:20.72]Alright, now let's get this off because I really am turning into like a fucking goblin.
[03:26.24]Am I wearing eyeliner?
[03:27.54]No?
[03:31.30]I don't think so unless somebody put it on me while I was like going just like this at the wall.
[03:41.66]I was like a stone person.
[03:44.46]No, this is just like I'm just like flush.
[03:49.80]But I'll give you the long and short of it.
[03:52.70]I've been dealing with this for three days now.
[03:55.66]I was up at 7 o'clock this morning.
[03:57.30]I slept for like three hours.
[03:59.26]I've been trying to be on top of this shit.
[04:02.29]Get out of here.
[04:02.87]Get out of here.
[04:06.69]And I've got some... I've got some... Bad news.
[04:14.81]Bad news.
[04:15.91]It's not really bad news as much as it's just...
[04:20.29]I mean, it just sucks, but whatever.
[04:25.32]Um, it's kind of like too long.
[04:29.42]It really is.
[04:30.00]You know, like something's just too long to even talk about it anymore.
[04:32.82]I've been talking about this for less like 34 hours.
[04:39.32]So, I'd be tell- Okay, you know when you go around at a family get-together, and there's like, I don't know, let's say there's like 30 or 40 people there, and every single person that you talk to, you have to tell the same story to?
[04:54.09]Hey, so, hey, Johnny!
[04:58.47]How's school?
[04:59.77]You're an engineering student, right?
[05:01.07]What's that like?
[05:02.81]Well, yeah, I was an engineering student.
[05:06.04]I work on engineering, and I'm making this new plane of architecture.
[05:11.72]And I won an award for it in the school paper.
[05:15.60]And, oh, wow, good to see you.
[05:19.10]And you're walking away to the next person.
[05:22.05]Oh, it's Johnny.
[05:23.53]It's me, Aunt Edna.
[05:25.63]You're in school, right?
[05:27.91]Yeah, yeah, I'm in school.
[05:29.33]As an engineering student, that must be really interesting.
[05:34.67]Yeah.
[05:35.33]What have you been doing?
[05:39.15]Well, I got an award.
[05:40.83]I got an award.
[05:41.51]I was working on this new plane thing.
[05:42.89]Plane?
[05:43.77]Wow, that's incredible.
[05:46.31]Tell me more.
[05:48.06]Uh, I got a divorce for it.
[05:50.08]I'm an engineering student.
[05:51.12]It's been, you know, the food, though, the school food, it kind of stinks, right, Grandma?
[05:56.00]Oh, yes, I am.
[05:57.94]Oh, you're so smart.
[05:59.00]You're the smartest one.
[06:00.50]And you keep going.
[06:02.87]Uncle Lou.
[06:04.37]Hey, how are you, Johnny?
[06:06.35]I mean, I heard somebody told me, you know, through that, that you're an engineering student.
[06:12.59]Yes, I am an engineering student.
[06:15.61]Ooh, what's that?
[06:16.75]You must work on planes.
[06:18.45]Yeah.
[06:19.91]Yeah, I work on airplanes, Lou.
[06:22.61]Oh, wow.
[06:23.55]Have you won any awards?
[06:30.10]I've been doing that for three days.
[06:39.28]Sell us again.
[06:40.30]No.
[06:43.49]Saved it for three days.
[06:44.97]Yeah.
[06:47.17]And I actually, like... I, like, time-looped myself, too, by the way.
[06:51.35]This is important.
[06:51.95]Because we're just hanging out right now, and you're hearing this.
[06:54.74]So, here's how I time-looped myself.
[06:56.94]So, a person from maintenance was here.
[07:00.72]this morning, right?
[07:03.04]And there was a bunch of bullshit.
[07:06.34]It turns out there's like a saturated node.
[07:09.14]You know, I'm an engineering student.
[07:11.08]I work on airplanes, you know, blah, blah, blah, right?
[07:14.04]So he gives me the idea, hey, you should get a static IP address.
[07:20.30]Maybe that'll help you with traffic and, you know, I got an award for my airplane design.
[07:27.44]So I call up the Cox tech support to try to get a static IP.
[07:33.69]So the guy on the phone is telling me, oh yeah, we're having problems issuing you this static IP.
[07:41.49]It's...
[07:44.57]No, I can't talk right now.
[07:46.19]I don't want to talk about my engineering degree anymore.
[07:48.71]This is them again.
[07:50.51]No.
[07:51.63]I'm not answering.
[07:52.19]I'm not talking about my engineering degree anymore.
[07:54.71]So, anyways.
[07:55.87]Static IP.
[07:57.87]They're telling me that they can't do it.
[07:59.11]There's a problem.
[07:59.81]There's like an issue with the static IP.
[08:01.37]And I'm like, what do you mean?
[08:02.23]What's an issue?
[08:03.01]Oh my god, what's happening?
[08:06.47]Fuck.
[08:08.42]I can't answer this on stream.
[08:09.80]That's not cool.
[08:12.18]What if they were like, quick!
[08:14.02]We're detecting router levels of over 400 degrees!
[08:19.52]Tell me, what do you do for work at school?
[08:23.86]Engineering?
[08:24.68]Yeah, yeah.
[08:26.22]Oh no, the router!
[08:34.97]Anyways.
[08:35.31]So.
[08:42.51]uh the the engineering student that talked no I'm not doing the webcam I look like trash I'm gonna mute the volume but no keep the music background music's nice so static IP right just listen listen they tell me there's a problem here with your static IP the phone rings again I swear to god no it didn't so the static IP
[09:06.64]Could not go through, and the guy couldn't figure out why.
[09:09.00]So he told me, well, hold on a minute here.
[09:11.44]I actually see there's an outage in your area.
[09:15.22]I was like, really?
[09:17.80]What did he tell you?
[09:18.83]Yeah, yeah, it looks like.
[09:20.75]This is probably what's going on with the static IP.
[09:22.79]You're getting packet loss here.
[09:24.39]Somebody's going to be out there to fix that.
[09:28.36]There's an outage!
[09:29.94]And I'm sitting there going, no, that's me.
[09:35.48]I'm going like a full on go back in time, time loop scenario.
[09:39.40]Where like I was the one that had the guy come out to try to fix the packet loss.
[09:45.62]And the guy thought it was an outage in the area, but he's talking to the person that like caused the guy to come down.
[09:53.01]So I didn't even say anything.
[09:55.29]I was like, oh, wow.
[09:56.85]Yeah, that's interesting.
[09:57.73]Yeah, I think there's something wrong with the line.
[10:00.00]Yeah, I mean... Got an award for that.
[10:05.86]So, as it stands right now, we're switching to a static IP.
[10:10.22]And it's maybe going to help.
[10:11.96]But the super-duper long sad story is... It's not going to fix the problem.
[10:19.57]Because we have a saturated node and it's going to take them...
[10:24.62]Uh, this is not a joke.
[10:25.48]I'm not kidding.
[10:26.46]This is real.
[10:31.28]It's gonna take him ten years to fix it.
[10:41.53]It's gonna take him ten years.
[10:43.91]Yeah, well, you know, we're working all this stuff and, uh, the plan is to have it all done in ten years.
[10:49.61]To, like, replace all the nodes and stuff.
[10:51.25]And I'm like, wow, ten years!
[10:55.50]At least my children will have good internet.
[10:58.85]No, no, no.
[10:59.81]The static IP might work.
[11:02.37]In fact, we haven't dropped any frames so far.
[11:04.19]It's just all over the place.
[11:05.19]There's nothing I can do about it.
[11:06.55]So, the real end of the story, to move on, and we're going to play Garden Flipper, if you were curious, is Vegas has done a lot of development in the last year.
[11:19.84]Before we got here, they've dialed it up to 1,000.
[11:24.70]Fiber is now starting to become... Oh my god, why did I just say it?
[11:31.26]Why did I just say that?
[11:41.62]I don't know what happened, man.
[11:42.99]All I picture is like, okay, you know, like the cartoon, like in the cartoon with a guy, like if somebody has like the charcoal all over their face and their hair is out like this and they're like kind of dirty.
[11:55.04]All I picture is like that guy like with like frayed out hair and like the loony tunes like, I don't know, man.
[12:01.91]I pressed a couple of wrong buttons.
[12:09.72]400 degrees.
[12:11.74]See you in 10 years.
[12:12.84]No, but... And also it might have been like all the water, all the rain that Vegas has had.
[12:18.51]But we'll put a cap on this.
[12:21.69]Fiber is coming out here.
[12:23.35]It's coming everywhere.
[12:24.03]There's a ton of new development.
[12:25.97]And even if it means that I have to move like down the street, that's not a problem.
[12:34.50]That's not a big deal.
[12:36.34]And you do what you got to do.
[12:39.88]Just move down the street to get fiber.
[12:45.08]That is a very real possibility.
[12:47.42]If we keep having problems, right?
[12:49.96]Look, I am not going to be the one to tell you.
[12:53.61]Just move.
[12:58.87]But moving right down the street to get fiber or to make sure that it's there on some of these newer developments.
[13:06.41]There's like hundreds of them.
[13:08.61]They're popping up everywhere.
[13:11.08]All over the whole entire, like, Las Vegas Valley.
[13:13.36]They're everywhere.
[13:15.04]And that, the guy told me, all these huge new developments that they're going all over the place here in Vegas, they're all going to have fiber laid out there.
[13:21.78]And I'm like, oh.
[13:22.24]Alright, well, maybe I'll look.
[13:27.30]Las Vegas.
[13:27.98]I'm sorry.
[13:28.74]I've been sleepless.
[13:32.20]How long have I been live?
[13:34.80]14 minutes, exactly.
[13:37.29]Just get Elon Musk's internet.
[13:39.61]Musk's.
[13:41.09]Elon Musk's.
[13:41.89]Elon Musk.
[13:42.77]Get Elon Musk's internet.
[13:48.93]But I can't let it bother me.
[13:51.12]I'm not gonna.
[13:52.26]You know, life's too short to get bad.
[13:57.20]I'm just like, it's just, I'm just, I'm just fucking hanging out.
[14:00.42]You know what I mean?
[14:02.95]So, here we go.
[14:06.20]What we're going to do today is we're going to see how long we can be live for.
[14:09.18]We're going to get the static IP change over tomorrow.
[14:12.96]Hopefully that helps.
[14:15.44]And they are going to monitor us and just make sure that nothing really major happens.
[14:21.59]But, you know, whatever.
[14:23.63]Life's too short.
[14:25.87]Life's too short to pay premium internet prices for internet that will be installed in 10 years.
[14:30.08]What's going on?
[14:33.60]What's going on?
[14:38.36]No, no.
[14:38.90]Oh, you guys are like scared.
[14:40.20]Okay, I might be like overtired.
[14:42.04]You guys just scared the shit out of me.
[14:43.72]I thought there was like somebody in my room.
[14:49.17]What's happening?
[14:49.89]What did I say?
[14:55.87]I'm sitting here going, is somebody like gonna like strangle me behind me?
[15:00.53]Why would that happen?
[15:07.01]But we're just gonna chill.
[15:14.18]We're gonna hang out.
[15:16.52]We'll see how long we can go.
[15:19.16]This might not be a very long stream.
[15:21.28]I'm sorry.
[15:22.56]But, you know, sometimes it's... What is it?
[15:26.60]Let's go through the stages.
[15:28.74]Anger.
[15:30.36]Denial.
[15:31.84]And then... Super Saiyan.
[15:35.66]And then... Out of Mana.
[15:40.40]Then... Super Impose?
[15:45.88]No.
[15:46.97]Whatever it is.
[15:48.49]Impose.
[15:49.89]Imposition on somebody.
[15:53.09]And then Denial again.
[15:54.81]And then you accept your fate.
[15:56.37]I think we're pretty much somewhere in the acceptance stage.
[16:02.45]Denial 2 is real.
[16:11.82]But this is Garden Flipper.
[16:14.16]Don't pay no attention to the house.
[16:17.70]Oh, hold on a second here.
[16:21.08]Look in the lower left corner.
[16:24.79]Hey, it's Jeremy.
[16:26.87]It's me.
[16:28.17]I'm calling you from my home office.
[16:31.21]The degrees went so much higher than I originally anticipated.
[16:37.07]I was trying to fix it.
[16:40.65]And then I did like a 1980s Home Alone style movie thing where I grabbed the two ends of the wires and connect them and then there's an explosion.
[16:57.90]Sorry, I'll get back to you.
[17:01.66]This house sucks, but who cares?
[17:02.70]We're doing gardens today.
[17:05.80]Oh, there's the laptop.
[17:08.50]I had to put it on a cool surface.
[17:12.94]It's been a long time since we've been in this game.
[17:17.20]Crackouts.
[17:19.50]We're gonna learn how to play Garden Flipper.
[17:22.51]A bit of gravel and a couple of bushes.
[17:24.65]Hello, I work at home in my dentist's office.
[17:28.33]I can deal with all kinds of teeth cavities, but not with the holes and weeds in my garden.
[17:33.83]Please lay some gravel on the front part of my yard to get rid of these.
[17:36.58]Also, could you plant something on there to make it look better?
[17:38.56]This is a stay-at-home dentist?
[17:45.62]You work at... your home is the dentist.
[17:54.04]That's kind of weird.
[17:57.44]Planting is now available.
[17:59.55]Oh, uh, a murderer.
[18:04.35]For now on you're able to design a garden.
[18:05.79]Look for plants in ga- Look for plants in garden category in the shop.
[18:13.31]Okay, plants in garden category.
[18:17.38]You unlocked a garden hose!
[18:19.51]Congratulations, you've unlocked a new tool.
[18:21.03]Using a garden hose will be able to water flowers, fill water tanks, and wash dirt outside the house.
[18:26.73]So are we going to power wash again?
[18:30.30]Garden hose.
[18:32.98]That's kind of... Oh, nice!
[18:41.19]Can I open his house and spray in?
[18:55.93]What was I doing?
[18:57.69]Ruining all of his furniture?
[18:59.71]Ah, that's what I thought.
[19:01.87]Okay, so he wanted me to pick his weeds?
[19:03.57]I got $539,000.
[19:05.23]Why did I just retire?
[19:06.01]I don't have to do this.
[19:06.63]I got half a million dollars.
[19:08.07]Okay, remove weeds.
[19:28.27]He's gonna retire.
[19:30.37]Okay, scatter the surface single-colored gravel, and then plant a cun- furious shrub.
[19:42.65]So, the weeds have the little flowers on them.
[19:47.96]Why- why did somebody just say woosh?
[19:52.60]Woosh.
[19:54.34]Did I miss a joke?
[19:56.10]What's the joke?
[19:57.82]Ooh, I got a skill point.
[20:00.48]New gardener skill available.
[20:01.42]Click the hotkey to upgrade the gardener skill.
[20:03.42]Okay, so what do we got?
[20:05.56]Faster planting?
[20:09.28]Faster digging with a shovel.
[20:10.58]100% faster unfolding grass from the roll.
[20:15.22]Grass comes from the ground.
[20:19.16]Large 2019 trimmer.
[20:22.05]Shovel.
[20:24.09]Bushi.
[20:25.01]And then coming soon.
[20:28.02]High grass visible on the mini-map.
[20:29.74]So we got gardener scents.
[20:31.74]Visible moles on the mini-map.
[20:35.36]This streamer has never been to Home Depot before.
[20:41.71]Alright, let's get this one.
[20:44.05]No, this one.
[20:45.37]Yeah.
[20:46.01]High grass visible on the mini-map.
[20:47.81]So we can see what we're dealing with here.
[20:49.21]I'm gonna make this dentist's office look beautiful.
[21:00.01]Okay, so... Okay, so... Remove weeds, 71%.
[21:08.17]Yeah, that's perfect.
[21:09.62]Plant, shrubs, scatter the... Single-colored gravel.
[21:12.90]Can I lift this up?
[21:19.00]I need gravel.
[21:23.54]Single-colored gravel.
[21:25.46]Ooh!
[21:27.63]What color?
[21:31.93]We want, uh, large rocks, medium rocks, or little rocks.
[21:40.72]At the cereal- this is rice.
[21:42.66]It's not rice.
[21:44.74]I'm gonna- I'm gonna plant, like, a Quaker oat rice cake in your lawn.
[21:55.70]Okay, let's buy- how many?
[21:56.86]Buy many.
[21:59.40]Oh, what the fuck?
[22:02.45]No, no, no, no, no.
[22:02.81]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[22:04.07]This is wrong.
[22:06.77]Do I have any other tools?
[22:11.45]Scatter... No, I have to scatter this surface, but how do I... This looks terrible.
[22:14.61]How do I get rid of this?
[22:23.18]Sell the grass.
[22:27.26]I don't think I can sell the grass.
[22:29.32]Do I have, like, a trimmer?
[22:31.89]Pee on grass.
[22:32.84]That's not gonna work.
[22:34.48]That's gonna make it worse.
[22:36.22]Because I got all the weeds.
[22:39.70]What do you mean he actually tried?
[22:42.95]Of course I'm gonna try.
[22:44.05]I'm just gonna do it.
[22:46.67]Look, what a dumb job this is.
[22:49.55]Okay, I'm gonna just scatter it around.
[23:00.17]Is that what you want me to do?
[23:01.85]Wait, what?
[23:07.61]I really am just putting rice cakes in his weeds.
[23:15.00]Scatter the surface, single colored gravel.
[23:20.40]Oh.
[23:24.50]I want to cut, this is fucking me up, man.
[23:26.38]I want to, like, cut this, uh...
[23:31.44]You didn't do it like this.
[23:32.54]You put like a tarp down underneath.
[23:34.16]Okay.
[23:46.13]I'm gonna be completely honest with you all here.
[23:49.13]I'm gonna be totally honest with you.
[23:51.01]Is it scatter the surface or cover the surface?
[23:58.74]Like, cover the whole surface?
[24:00.80]Scatter the surface.
[24:03.76]Why wouldn't it just be cover the surface with the gravel?
[24:06.96]Because that's what I'm doing.
[24:15.67]It's... Do two-tone?
[24:17.27]No, I don't care.
[24:18.31]I'm not getting paid for two-tone.
[24:22.37]Two-tone!
[24:23.25]Not yet.
[24:23.61]I was just learning.
[24:27.10]I missed a spot?
[24:27.92]I'm not getting paid to get every spot.
[24:29.98]Alright, this is... Why is it at 0%?
[24:40.19]Oh, fuck!
[25:08.09]Is that why people were saying, woosh?
[25:13.75]I like the way this looks, though.
[25:14.74]It reminds me of the sea.
[25:17.04]Am I getting, like, sea vibes here?
[25:20.92]Like, bottom of the ocean?
[25:21.74]Like, that's like a wallpaper at the bottom of the ocean.
[25:23.90]Probably should have done square.
[25:32.17]Use the scroll wheel.
[25:37.15]Thank you!
[25:38.61]Appreciate the help!
[25:43.43]Okay.
[25:44.95]What does it want on this one?
[25:46.59]Two colored gravel.
[25:48.29]What is doing this one?
[25:48.97]We already have it equipped.
[25:53.35]I'm just like waiting for someone to scream from outside of this house.
[25:56.77]Like from in the house.
[26:03.43]Lazy.
[26:03.87]This is just the tutorial mission.
[26:11.34]Okay, and then we gotta plant that shrub there.
[26:13.70]This is one tone, right?
[26:14.98]Single colored gravel.
[26:19.68]Single colored gravel.
[26:22.30]And... This is the... Which one was this?
[26:25.97]How big would the... Yeah, that's the same one.
[26:31.39]I will never hire you.

[27:16.01]Uh, yeah, probably.
[27:17.51]Have a good day.
[27:20.11]Haven't you ever seen One Punch Man?
[27:23.84]No!
[27:24.82]I don't watch anime.
[27:27.04]He slams the door.
[27:27.88]Alright, uh, what was it?
[27:30.72]What was it?
[27:31.30]Shrub?
[27:33.80]Shrub.
[27:35.16]Does it matter which one?
[27:38.45]Does it just call him?
[27:39.71]Just any shrub?
[27:43.22]Any one of these Confucius shrubs.
[27:49.95]Pick a nice one.
[27:51.09]What about the little ones?
[27:54.31]Oh, these are Christmas trees.
[27:58.38]This is just a fake Christmas tree that somebody didn't unfold yet.
[28:01.02]That one's alright.
[28:14.49]Right in the middle.
[28:19.77]Got it.
[28:20.59]Oh, fuck.
[28:26.56]What do I do with the dirt?
[28:34.04]How far do I have to dig into the ground?
[28:37.71]The hole is now dug, alright.
[28:42.31]Now you can put the plant in the hole.
[28:44.83]Oh.
[28:46.13]Eat dirt, eat dirt, eat dirt.
[28:48.30]I'll do it.
[28:48.66]Okay, let's plant it here.
[28:58.98]What's going on?
[29:00.99]Wait, do I already have it equipped or something?
[29:11.45]Is there not enough room?
[29:12.50]Hold on.
[29:17.52]Oh, it's like, it was behind the gate.
[29:19.86]Okay.
[29:20.14]I'm like, wait, what?
[29:24.64]Why would I do this with my hands?
[29:26.13]You're gonna get sick.
[29:34.11]Alright, here we go.
[29:34.83]Cool.
[29:40.09]Do it again.
[29:40.99]That looks nice.
[29:44.61]This is fun.
[29:46.93]Same one over here.
[29:49.01]Right there.
[29:49.51]Let's dig.
[29:52.47]Alright, let's... I'm just putting it back in.
[30:11.59]Alright, let's put it in.
[30:13.97]Let's do it with our hands.
[30:16.44]Why don't you just kick it in there with your shoes?
[30:24.48]So this order's not complete.
[30:25.96]No, I'm going to finish the order.
[30:29.40]We'll do this one right in front, right here.
[30:33.48]Same thing with this one.
[30:35.90]Right here.
[30:38.67]Let's plant them.
[30:42.30]Blush the car.
[30:46.44]What the hell are you talking about?
[30:58.76]Spray the car with your hose.
[31:01.38]Yeah, that's a car wash.
[31:07.35]I can't wait to turn the hose sideways, spray it gently, and lick it like a dog.
[31:13.86]And then make a joke about it.
[31:15.22]That's how you get sick.
[31:43.02]Let me get some air in these tires.
[31:44.28]Alright, so that's it.
[32:00.49]Alright.
[32:00.79]$2,524.
[32:00.89]I want to complete it.
[32:04.09]Back to my dump.
[32:08.96]Build a Walmart.
[32:10.84]I don't think I can do that.
[32:12.76]I got a new negotiation skill, didn't I?
[32:15.88]So this is... I'm picking up where I left off.
[32:17.86]Why is my house such a piece of crap?
[32:26.44]Didn't I have a better house?
[32:28.60]What is going on here?
[32:34.34]I thought I had like a huge Best Buy house.
[32:40.12]Owned.
[32:41.71]Won.
[32:42.17]Sold.
[32:44.66]I sold them all!
[32:50.12]Holy shit.
[32:50.80]This is almost a garden.
[32:53.96]But wait, not yet.
[32:55.14]Hold on.
[32:57.90]A house in a thicket.
[33:02.38]Old house with a bunker.
[33:03.74]Uncle's bunker.
[33:04.87]I think we did some of these.
[33:05.97]Look at this place.
[33:06.67]Garden after house construction.
[33:08.71]This place is run down.
[33:13.13]That's the Home Alone movie house.
[33:19.40]Alright, well, I got money, so... Oh, yeah, we did these.
[33:24.88]We've done them.
[33:26.76]See, look.
[33:27.90]I've done them.
[33:31.64]Well, let me just do... Let me learn the tools.
[33:35.48]You need to remove the bushes.
[33:37.98]Hey there, I have a bit of a problem.
[33:39.12]I tried to deal with weeds in my garden and got some kind of herbicide to get rid of them.
[33:42.91]Luckily, just to test it out, I used it on a couple of them and quickly realized it is extremely effective.
[33:47.51]It destroyed the weeds as well as my bushes.
[33:50.66]I'm really glad it didn't spray it all over my yard.
[33:52.82]But unfortunately, I did it right in front of, I don't know why I thought it was going to see my kids.
[33:57.61]Like, I sprayed my kids.
[33:59.91]I was like, wait, what?
[34:01.65]I did it right in front of the entrance.
[34:03.60]Now the plants in that area are dried up and look pathetic.
[34:06.80]Please wipe them out and fill that spot with some fresh grass.
[34:10.24]Oh, and if you could mow my lawn as well, that'd be fantastic.
[34:14.77]Alright, that sounds like a plan.
[34:16.29]Am I going to get the lawnmower?
[34:21.99]You've unlocked a new tool.
[34:23.21]From now on, you'll be able to cut grass using a garden brush cutter.
[34:29.91]Really?
[34:30.17]Alright, these are dead.
[34:35.62]Remove object.
[34:36.78]So, get rid of the shrub.
[34:39.60]Use the turf roll to spread the grass in the area.
[34:41.56]Mow the lawn.
[34:42.12]Well, let's brush cutter.
[34:45.04]Oh, shit.
[34:48.53]No, can't.
[34:51.09]Oh, alright.
[34:51.57]So, you do just have to cut the lawn.
[34:57.54]Oh, I'm not doing this well.
[34:59.12]I'm doing this like crap.
[35:00.56]Am I spraying the... Oh.
[35:02.48]No, that's just the clippings.
[35:10.40]That's not how that works.
[35:12.67]It's close enough.
[35:15.59]Okay, so the lawn still needs to be over here.
[35:26.84]I have no idea what I'm doing.
[35:28.42]I'm not a good landscaper.
[35:29.46]I'm really good at breaking things.
[35:30.70]Okay, use the turf roll to spread the grass in the area.
[35:34.50]Remove all the shrubs.
[35:38.30]Remove Confucius shrub spherical shape.
[35:41.93]Well, where are they?
[35:43.43]How do I get rid of them?
[35:45.03]Can I sell these?
[35:47.47]I guess not.
[35:47.85]Just remove, right?
[35:48.57]Yeah.
[35:53.87]Okay, so then plant the grass here.
[35:57.98]Turf roller.
[36:04.11]Turf roll.
[36:06.69]Uh, just buy it?
[36:08.21]How do I use this?
[36:12.22]Press to pay in place.
[36:15.66]Rotate item.
[36:20.10]What?
[36:22.54]Wait, is that it?
[36:23.28]Is it gonna work?
[36:29.78]Should it be rolling?
[36:31.80]How do I roll it?
[36:35.26]How do I roll?
[36:36.06]Wait, hold on.
[36:42.58]I'm picking it up.
[36:43.44]What?
[36:43.74]This is press to place.
[36:50.54]This is rotate.
[36:57.37]Wait, what?
[37:03.48]No, don't cut and finish!
[37:05.04]Wait, god damn it.
[37:08.96]When I placed it here before, I didn't get this opportunity.
[37:11.07]Okay, use.
[37:12.77]Spread.
[37:13.21]There we go.
[37:17.15]How far does it go?
[37:17.79]Oh, that's so terrible looking.
[37:25.04]This is like two layers.
[37:26.30]Whatever, they're not gonna know.
[37:29.12]Buy many.
[37:36.79]Okay, that goes all the way.
[37:37.79]And then this is going to go like this.
[37:48.82]No one can even see it back here.
[37:50.70]What if I just don't put it under there?
[37:52.00]Alright, here we go.
[38:10.87]What?
[38:11.67]I can't... It's because this is in the way.
[38:13.97]They're not even going to fucking know.
[38:18.29]Yeah, fuck them.
[38:19.23]What do they care?
[38:20.47]They're not going to even know.
[38:27.90]Just leave the rolls.
[38:34.94]This is my first job as a landscaper.
[38:41.20]I can't even get them.
[38:42.94]So we're gonna go this way.
[38:45.68]45%?
[38:45.78]Are they gonna get mad at me?
[38:48.52]Fuck you, do it yourself?
[38:49.94]No, I didn't say fuck you.
[38:52.84]I said... I don't care.
[38:54.83]There's a difference.
[38:59.55]Is that... That looks like it's not even correct.
[39:02.61]Look at that!
[39:03.09]God damn it!
[39:07.65]This uneasy work is giving me a headache.
[39:11.99]You're fine.
[39:14.25]Okay, what?
[39:15.07]Just because there's like an inch of space, you have a headache now?
[39:19.27]What?
[39:20.85]No, you can't... I'm just learning the tools.
[39:26.76]Yes.
[39:34.52]I'm at 95%.
[39:34.82]Look, I'll just do... It's fine.
[39:36.14]Take a look.
[39:36.48]Check this out.
[39:36.90]Ready?
[39:42.96]Because this looks like it's on the lip right here.
[39:46.22]But I don't think it is.
[39:47.98]You see what I'm talking about?
[39:52.99]See, shouldn't that be covering it?
[39:57.23]Okay, that's fine.
[39:59.31]See?
[39:59.93]Look at it.
[40:00.25]See?
[40:01.53]What the hell?
[40:04.09]See?
[40:04.29]Look at that.
[40:17.16]This is too hard.
[40:18.16]Landscaping's too hard.
[40:26.15]How am I... I have to, like, pull the fence up to get this under here.
[40:28.79]That's not part of the job.
[40:29.95]It's fine.
[40:30.31]This one's done.
[40:35.01]Yeah, no, this is... We're good.
[40:37.27]Mow the lawn.
[40:38.63]Mow their lawn?
[40:39.61]I have to mow the neighbor's lawn?
[40:43.56]Look at that.
[40:44.32]I'm not doing that.
[40:56.06]Yeah, me and Ted have an agreement.
[41:01.50]My son used to do it.
[41:04.22]But he really didn't give a shit.
[41:07.20]He just... By the way, I'm projecting here.
[41:09.66]This is me.
[41:10.26]I'm describing.
[41:10.96]So when I used to get asked to mow the lawn, my father would say, Go mow the lawn!
[41:15.29]Come on!
[41:15.53]Help outside!
[41:16.01]Get some help in the yard!
[41:16.71]I'd be like, okay, fine.
[41:18.83]And I'd go out there.
[41:19.67]And we had a pretty big yard.
[41:22.11]And what I would do is I would start in the middle.
[41:28.27]No, no, no, no.
[41:28.73]I would end in the middle.
[41:29.60]I would just do a giant circle, right?
[41:33.84]So I would start like on the edges, and I would go like this, around in a huge circle.
[41:40.62]And then I would line the tires up with the end of where I end.
[41:46.05]So I made like a giant spiral.
[41:47.25]So the next pass would be like this, and then like this, and then like this, and like this, until you got in the middle.
[41:57.27]That's how you mow a lawn?
[42:08.94]No, it's not.
[42:10.24]You're supposed to go like straight up and then straight down lining up the tires so you get a straight line.
[42:17.80]The background, the background, the backyard was a giant spiral.
[42:25.33]And my father was pissed.
[42:32.22]And then there was a part of the yard where the dogs went out and there was a little section of the yard that they would go to and there was like a rock out there and they peed on it and they like kind of shit out there.
[42:42.28]And I would always avoid it because I didn't want to like run over dog shit.
[42:53.67]I would like avoid it because I didn't want to like go out there and like clean it up and then mow the lawn.
[42:58.63]And my father would always be like, what?
[42:59.95]You missed the dog pen.
[43:02.12]Oh, yeah, but it's okay.
[43:04.54]I'll get it later.
[43:05.34]And he'd be like, oh, my fucking son.
[43:18.60]Okay, is this done?
[43:19.49]48%!
[43:19.51]What am I missing?
[43:27.29]Is it taking in the equation the whole thing over here?
[43:33.05]I can't sell the grill?
[43:34.03]Ah, it's too bad.
[43:38.65]Look in the mini-map.
[43:40.97]Yeah, it's all this shit.
[43:45.13]But I can't get rid of this.
[43:47.09]Does this count as they don't want me to get rid of this?
[43:50.23]I don't want to... Okay.
[43:59.18]Alright, let's at least do this.
[44:01.58]Can I get a bigger roll of tape?
[44:04.70]Can I make this bigger?
[44:09.87]Big roll.
[44:12.57]Thank you, Jesus.
[44:13.59]No, wait a minute.
[44:14.49]This is too big.
[44:26.02]What a waste.
[44:29.42]And throw the rest in the trash.
[44:40.36]It looks like... That's correct though!
[44:42.16]Look it!
[44:42.54]See?
[44:42.74]That... That... Okay.
[44:45.76]If I click right now, doesn't that look correct?
[44:48.78]Look at where it's lining up with the edges.
[44:53.41]See?
[44:53.93]That's... That's like right in the corner there.
[44:55.71]Right?
[44:57.75]It's from the bottom of the roll.
[44:59.67]So like this...
[45:12.58]Start from the fence.
[45:17.31]No, you... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[45:19.41]Stay.
[45:19.65]I need to...
[45:33.68]No, they'll figure it out.
[45:35.38]Watch this be the phone call, that is.
[45:39.01]Mr. Elbertson, we're going to be shutting your internet off for about 30 minutes to do the static IP change.
[45:46.41]If you could do me a favor and just not use your internet and stay far away from it.
[46:01.40]Well, you'll find out in a second here.
[46:02.64]What a waste.
[46:03.49]I know, but don't worry.
[46:08.25]We're gonna go down, and then I'm gonna cut that.
[46:14.83]It's alright.
[46:15.23]Just get tweezers and you pick that up.
[46:17.52]This is done.
[46:18.60]I'm learning still.
[46:19.48]I'm just learning.
[46:21.06]Let's get the even... Wait, wait.
[46:22.26]Let me see what the smaller one looks like.
[46:25.02]Look, here we go.
[46:25.74]This is a perfect little roll of tape.
[46:40.00]Why?
[46:40.16]I mean, it's... I need to, like, move their fence.
[46:48.16]Hey, I can't.
[46:50.50]I can't sell their fence and I can't move it.
[46:52.22]So, like, I can't do that.
[46:55.64]I'm sorry.
[46:56.90]You're not gonna let me move your shit?
[47:15.20]I can't wait till I get a real lawnmower.
[47:16.60]I can't wait to show you guys.
[47:17.46]I'm going to cut the lawn like I used to.
[47:19.81]And we can compare the two ways.
[47:23.73]You're not going to let me uproot your whole fence.
[47:27.57]No, I just need to move it.
[47:30.87]Well, why did they decide to do this?
[47:32.42]You can'tberger.
[47:32.84]You can't do it like this.
[47:38.30]It actually looks kind of good.
[47:42.03]Up the game audio?
[47:46.44]I could do that.
[47:47.70]How is it?
[47:54.18]Better?
[47:56.66]That's probably a little better.
[47:58.74]Take a dip in the pool?
[47:59.56]That's unfortunate.
[48:02.76]It's cold out.
[48:03.40]I can't.
[48:11.11]It's a glass pool.
[48:16.83]Internet.
[48:17.15]What do you guys think is the next step of the internet?
[48:30.84]Gardeners.
[48:33.00]Gardener Jesus.
[48:35.56]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[48:36.31]Okay, never mind.
[48:37.05]I was like, what does that mean?
[48:43.18]100% wireless?
[48:43.68]I don't want that.
[48:46.24]Any other, like, fucking boomers in this chat, like, actually scared of, like, 7G?
[48:49.60]We're gonna start growing horns.
[49:09.01]Imagine not wanting horns.
[49:14.51]And like the telecom companies will all spin it, you know what I mean?
[49:18.17]They'll be at like a hearing.
[49:21.95]Well, you know, the thing is, everyone has started to grow two extra eyes.
[49:26.91]But now you can see twice as good.
[49:29.93]I see that as a plus.
[49:34.13]Okay, this is... What's the other percentage here?
[49:36.15]Right here?
[49:43.94]97.
[49:43.96]90, alright, there it is.
[49:47.88]100% complete.
[49:48.24]I didn't have to do anything else.
[49:55.87]Uh, yeah, the senator from New York would like to ask a question.
[50:00.17]Yeah, uh, so, we've got four eyes now, but two of them throw up blood every six hours.
[50:08.13]Well, I think that's just progress, you know.
[50:17.88]We're done.
[50:26.10]That's a cool straw man.
[50:28.29]Wait, what?
[50:29.55]If you had eyes that had blood coming out of them that were extra eyes because of 7G wireless technology.
[50:35.97]I don't think that's a straw man.
[50:37.47]I think that's a real man.
[50:43.03]Ah, good to be home.
[50:48.96]This is dirty.
[50:55.90]What the hell is a straw man?
[50:58.70]Ah, well, welcome to the world of politics.
[51:02.06]That's just fucking god!
[51:04.55]My heart hurts.
[51:06.19]Fuck.
[51:19.74]Come on.
[51:20.63]Oh my god, that was horrible.
[51:22.81]I did not... Jesus Christ!
[51:35.60]How do I stop that?
[51:40.62]Can I... was it... it was never that loud before.
[51:43.14]Wow!
[51:57.32]Why is it getting louder?
[51:59.24]Wait, I need to try something.
[52:00.58]Cover your ears.
[52:02.42]Mute the stream for a second.
[52:03.84]I'm gonna do, I need to see, is this gonna, is it going down?
[52:06.81]Cover, I'm serious, please, this is a warning, this is an audio warning.
[52:10.39]Like, it might lower it, because that was definitely way louder.
[52:14.73]Okay, you ready?
[52:15.61]Just, I'm giving you a pure warning in five seconds.
[52:18.28]Here it comes.
[52:19.22]One, two, three, four,
[52:25.56]I don't know what to do.
[52:26.24]I can never knock a wall down.
[52:37.51]I can never do anything with the walls.
[52:43.02]The master?
[52:43.78]Yeah, but the master turns everything down.
[52:49.00]Like...
[53:01.20]Oh, what were you saying again?
[53:03.08]What were you saying?
[53:04.19]Oh my god.
[53:11.75]Okay, well, keep a mental note.
[53:21.18]I cannot use the hammer.
[53:23.40]And if I do, I need to turn the source audio down all the way.
[53:27.65]Disable sound.
[53:46.65]That's unfortunate.
[53:48.09]That's unfortunate.
[53:49.53]That sounds like a bug to me.
[54:01.10]It's a known bug?
[54:02.60]Reset the game.
[54:03.36]Did I have to do it?
[54:05.32]Is it saved?
[54:06.64]I have it saved, right?
[54:07.82]By progress.
[54:15.08]What about my progress?
[54:22.67]Uh-oh, guys.
[54:23.33]I don't think... I think I may have lost my progress.
[54:29.27]Turn the in-game sound down in volume mixer and then... I don't think this... Is that going to do it?
[54:43.22]Let's try it.
[54:47.02]We're on the worst timeline.
[54:48.90]Why the worst timeline?
[54:57.64]Is it getting louder?
[54:58.56]I don't know, man.
[55:00.74]I think I might have to type into my computer.
[55:06.39]Out on Steam.
[55:08.19]I got it already.
[55:10.11]Okay, let's test it.
[55:30.35]Last attempt and then I'm not using this device.
[55:41.64]I need everybody to do me a big favor, though.
[55:44.48]Like, for real.
[55:46.64]When there is an opportunity for me that I need to use this... I need to... You guys have to spam chat.
[55:55.37]Just write hammer sound or something.
[55:58.47]I'll forget.
[56:01.42]And I will fill somebody watching this stream's pants with shit because of that.
[56:08.21]No, I know now.
[56:09.23]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[56:10.57]But what about the other sounds?
[56:11.67]Let me make sure.
[56:12.21]Hold on.
[56:14.51]No, that's fine.
[56:15.13]What about this one?
[56:16.07]What about the paint sounds?
[56:17.23]The tiling sounds?
[56:19.84]How loud is this?
[56:29.70]That's fine.
[56:30.10]It's just the hammer.
[56:36.95]Okay.
[56:37.95]Next garden, uh, tool.
[56:41.58]Playground and barbecue.
[56:43.98]Substrats for liquors instead of flowers.
[56:48.16]What about the barbecue?
[56:48.66]That'd be really nice.
[56:50.00]We've already enlarged the terrace.
[57:11.15]But now there's so much space and not much to fill it with.
[57:14.37]A... A... Bregola would be useful here.
[57:18.09]Also a grill and a table for the whole family.
[57:20.49]Big enough to fit all of us.
[57:21.97]Even the grandparents when they visit us.
[57:24.17]Oh, and would you remove all these nettles too?
[57:26.52]Those are the worst.
[57:27.58]I don't want my sweetie to get some burns from them.
[57:30.60]Okay, the first two sentences and the last two sentences to remove from this email.
[57:34.40]I'm doing a service.
[57:35.20]I'm doing a job.
[57:35.78]Tell me what you want me to do.
[57:37.32]This... This... I don't... I don't need to... I don't need this info.
[57:45.49]This right here.
[57:55.35]Oh, they were big bits earlier.
[57:56.54]Holy shit.
[58:02.72]I was too busy talking about cocks.
[58:06.90]We had 50 bucks, 5,000 bits from Rhineville.
[58:10.32]Hopefully he's still here.
[58:12.95]Thank you Ryanville for the 5000 bits, $50.
[58:14.53]They say, hey Jerma, I'm a Magic the Gathering artist, and your streams have kept me company during long hours of painting.
[58:21.67]Really appreciate the positive space and all the goofs.
[58:23.87]Keep up the funny shit, and know you're appreciated.
[58:26.11]P.S.
[58:26.49]Popsicle Jerma is a better piece of art than I've ever created.
[58:33.45]That's fucking awesome.
[58:35.13]Wow.
[58:36.49]Magic the Gathering artist.
[58:40.24]Yeah, I'm sure a ton of people in the chat would love to know some of the cards that you've worked on or done.
[58:44.28]That's really, really cool.
[58:47.00]But thank you for the $50, and I'm absolutely happy to keep you company while you're working on that cool shit.
[58:57.12]But thank you so much for the $50, and let us know what you're working on.
[59:00.31]That's cool.
[59:01.01]That's really, really cool.
[59:05.41]Alright, so...
[59:07.88]You've ruined his painting with that loud sound.
[59:12.63]Yeah, he's like... They're, like, working on the whatever it is, like, really detailed work, and they hear this.
[59:18.79]Smash!
[59:19.53]Oh, fuck!
[59:20.05]And they, like, move their hand and go, like, a big smear on it.
[59:22.78]Oh, shit.
[59:28.12]I'm sorry.
[59:28.68]I mean, I would feel so bad.
[59:39.80]Control Z. Yeah, but what if it was like a big oil painting?
[59:46.54]Is that how it works?
[59:52.10]I need a better tool than this.
[59:53.87]This thing sucks.
[59:56.53]Can't I, like, back up one of those log grinders?
[60:00.83]And then... No, but I would need to pull it up by hand.
[60:02.91]I need... I want just, like... I need a lawnmower.
[60:12.89]Use your skill points?
[60:13.61]Do I have any new skill points?
[60:22.46]Come on, get it.
[60:22.88]Hey, let's... All you have to do is start talking about it.
[60:25.92]Alright.
[60:26.78]Large 2019 trimmer.
[60:28.94]That's the one I want.
[60:33.21]That's it, right?
[60:34.05]Ooh.
[60:38.03]That's a much bigger radius.
[60:45.69]Take down those weeds Ain't ain't no corn growing on those Because it kind of looks like corn stalks Somebody whatever Speaking of which I I would long corn
[61:10.27]I would long maze.
[61:11.59]I don't think I would put that in a short cell.
[61:14.29]I feel like it's gonna really boom here soon.
[61:25.24]Alright, so now we got... There's still weeds over here.
[61:28.30]I'm not planting those yet.
[61:30.54]Look at all this crap.
[61:41.59]Alright, let me see the mini-map.
[61:44.15]That is just... I need to plant.
[61:47.25]Where's the rest of this?
[61:49.36]Oh, it's over here.
[61:50.14]Look at all... I missed all this.
[61:51.20]What a terrible gardener.
[61:55.56]Have you... Has this person ever been out here before?
[61:58.00]How long have you lived here?
[62:09.96]Those are just gonna grow back.
[62:11.10]I know, you gotta get in there and rip up the roots.
[62:15.62]By hand.
[62:16.08]Don't spread that poison shit on them.
[62:20.46]Get in there and rip them up.
[62:22.22]Get the roots.
[62:22.92]Okay, there's still weeds.
[62:26.38]Where are these last weeds?
[62:30.52]Well, let's plant this.
[62:31.36]I always like to rip them up with your teeth.
[62:42.81]Um, no, I'm talking about no tools.
[62:50.37]Like this.
[62:50.79]Get it in with your hands.
[62:57.34]That's good.
[62:58.26]Plant this one.
[63:01.92]Just use tools.
[63:02.68]You're a wuss.
[63:06.94]Don't ever call me that again.
[63:27.35]Please only use the sledgehammer.
[63:29.21]No, what?
[63:30.47]Hammer sound?
[63:31.19]I didn't do it.
[63:33.81]Wuss streamer yells at his fans.
[63:36.84]Don't ever say that I'm a wuss.
[63:47.44]That's not a very nice thing to say to somebody.
[63:56.44]Especially to somebody that's doing no sedation colonoscopy.
[64:03.30]Huh.
[64:04.89]My what?
[64:12.15]He's bragging about his colonoscopy.
[64:22.23]That just makes you look stupid.
[64:24.47]No.
[64:30.85]That's the hardest flex of 2019.
[64:34.02]Yeah, I'm going to prove to you guys that I'm not a wuss by doing no fucking sedation colonoscopy.
[64:40.80]And what are you going to say then?
[64:47.68]We would say that's unnecessary and just take the sedation.
[64:51.72]Yeah, I'm not a wuss.
[64:55.12]I know you're not, but you don't have to prove that.
[65:05.67]That's coming up soon, by the way.
[65:06.91]Fucking colonoscopy.
[65:14.02]Bullshit.
[65:15.20]God damn it.
[65:19.74]Too much information.
[65:23.58]I think most of the stream knows about my internal health.
[65:28.12]That's alright.
[65:28.62]Alright, I think this is good.
[65:32.10]Assemble wooden child swing.
[65:36.21]Cut those bushes, you wuss.
[65:44.69]Where are these other weeds?
[65:47.62]I can't trim them.
[65:49.12]Alright, we need- we need- the- the swing set's going right here.
[65:58.30]Swing.
[65:59.84]Wooden child swing.
[66:04.51]Should I just sell him the plastic one?
[66:05.77]Alright, let's see what we want.
[66:07.65]We want... Like a chrome finish.
[66:13.64]Uh... Frame handles.
[66:20.04]Yeah, we want like a chrome.
[66:30.13]Ugly, ugly, ew, ew, ugly.
[66:31.95]It's not your swing set.
[66:37.47]You don't have to swing on this.
[66:43.37]Dude, if it were me, though, I would put... I would put, like, something right here going up.
[66:48.85]Kind of like the hedges back here.
[66:51.88]So you could, like, jump out of the swing set over into the pool.
[66:57.16]I'll add a pool for free.
[66:58.02]It's fine.
[67:12.03]That was it.
[67:13.19]Oh, that was easy.
[67:13.61]Can I use it?
[67:14.03]Can I test it?
[67:14.53]Okay.
[67:17.17]Place Sandbox.
[67:25.81]I need two of these.
[67:28.37]These are huge!
[67:30.71]No, don't ever get one this big.
[67:34.52]There's too many.
[67:37.10]Put it right in the back door so they have to, like, climb through sand to go outside.
[67:47.32]That's not that big.
[67:48.32]This is really big.
[68:12.91]Okay, we're good.
[68:16.60]Too many sandboxes.
[68:17.60]Sandbox joke.
[68:18.55]I have a half a million dollars.
[68:19.67]I can make a joke like this.
[68:23.67]Guys, I can do like the stupid YouTube prank.
[68:27.57]I got like 500 fucking thousand dollars in my account.
[68:31.25]We're just gonna set up like two cameras.
[68:32.63]Like one here, one in the bushes over there.
[68:34.69]We're gonna hide back here behind the bushes.
[68:36.65]And then we're gonna watch them come out out the back.
[68:41.04]And we're gonna like laugh hysterically when they're like, I don't, what's happening here?
[68:45.64]God damn it!
[68:47.34]Damn it!
[68:47.74]And they're gonna turn around and go back inside.
[69:03.89]I can make that fucking joke, I got the money.
[69:16.45]Rooster spring rider.
[69:19.00]What is that?
[69:19.52]Rooster spring rider.
[69:24.30]Oh, it's one of these.
[69:25.00]It's one of those McDonald's toys.
[69:27.28]This is a very... What do you mean?
[69:41.38]This is from McDonald's.
[69:45.56]Old McDonald's play places used to have this shit.
[69:49.32]All yellow?
[69:51.37]No, that's ugly.
[69:57.91]That's alright.
[70:04.75]Your McDonald's had the throw-up corner.
[70:09.77]What is that?
[70:10.25]What is a throw-up corner?
[70:18.06]And then we need a cherry tree.
[70:24.78]How big does it have to be?
[70:26.40]It can be small, right?
[70:27.64]Yeah.
[70:27.78]And we'll put the cherry tree back here.
[70:39.39]Why do kids always throw up in there?
[70:43.03]I don't think that's hard to decipher that.
[70:46.30]You eat a bunch of McDonald's, and then you run around in a play place and slide down a bunch of slides.
[70:53.99]And get lost in like a ball pit.
[70:57.21]You... That's not hard.
[70:59.98]If you eat like a McDonald's cheeseburger, if I ate a McDonald's cheeseburger, or three of them or whatever, and then slid down a slide, I'd throw up when I got off.
[71:09.10]That looks good.
[71:13.59]Lost in a ball pit, how?
[71:15.85]You guys never went... Did you guys ever do ball pits?
[71:19.43]How old are some of you guys?
[71:23.36]Because if you were old enough to do the ball pit at McDonald's, you never did the thing where you dig, you dig, dig, dig your whole body to a point where you are underneath all of the balls.
[71:38.52]And you just like lie there for some reason.
[71:41.78]And pretend like you don't exist anymore.
[71:43.76]And then, like, somebody, like, jumps in and crushes you.
[71:55.92]What do you mean no one does that?
[71:57.59]You know how many times I've, like, bruised my shoulder and arm and leg?
[72:02.07]Because I got Hulk Hogan leg drop from some random kid that didn't know I was underneath them all?
[72:11.43]Alright, look at it.
[72:11.89]There's still weeds somewhere.
[72:12.99]I'm looking at the mini-map.
[72:17.31]I don't see any other weeds.
[72:18.33]Do you see any other weeds?
[72:23.67]These aren't weeds.
[72:27.07]No, those aren't weeds.
[72:30.68]Got him.
[72:34.46]There's more somewhere.
[72:35.34]There's one more.
[72:36.40]There's one little turd weed.
[72:41.81]You were recently in a ball pit.
[72:44.05]No, I just remember what it was like to be in a ball pit.
[72:54.57]You guys didn't have, like, throw the ball pit balls at each other when you were younger?
[73:02.04]That was original paintballing.
[73:08.76]That was like, that was like nine-year, eight-year-old paintballing.
[73:14.87]And you leveled up to go paintballing.
[73:19.69]You would just like get in a corner and just have a never-ending plastic snowball fight.
[73:23.61]You guys didn't do that?
[73:24.33]Alright, so I need to place two times... Why does it say 11?
[73:34.62]You want them on here.
[73:35.34]Alright.
[73:41.40]Which one is it?
[73:42.88]Pergola Moko.
[73:48.14]Pergola Moko.
[73:50.52]Oh, shit.
[73:51.08]Oh, yeah, they want this thing.
[73:53.38]Chrome finish.
[73:58.86]Oh, I hate these.
[73:59.76]Why do you want one of these?
[74:00.48]It's not my house, so why do I care?
[74:14.06]How do you put this here without it being ugly?
[74:19.68]Their back patio is not big enough to have this here.
[74:28.57]Well, might as well just... Whatever.
[74:34.45]Put it right in front of the door.
[74:35.41]Yeah, but what if it rains?
[74:38.23]And it gets all up in there.
[74:51.14]Oh, don't you drape something on this?
[74:58.14]Wait.
[75:04.55]They want ten of these?
[75:05.73]Hold on, how many of these do you want?
[75:10.17]I'm confused, hold on.
[75:17.67]Why do you want so many of these?
[75:21.45]You want more?
[75:25.37]Where am I supposed to put these?
[75:27.07]You're gonna have to put them on the roof.
[75:37.71]What?
[75:39.25]No, no.
[75:48.30]It changed?

[79:08.65]Use the rooster.
[79:17.61]That looks alright.
[79:20.27]With, like, the grandma sleep pod, which I'm gonna put down here.
[79:27.51]So, something's going on over here that I missed.
[79:30.72]Weeds, maybe?
[79:32.66]In the front of the house?
[79:38.32]It says I got everything done.
[79:43.36]How am I not at 100%?
[79:53.17]It's the three on the map.
[80:00.79]Oh, damn.
[80:01.77]Okay, two sofa sami.
[80:08.42]Sofa... Sofa sam... What is that?
[80:25.18]This doesn't look comfortable at all.
[80:26.32]Well, let's go make grandma.
[80:27.50]Now we need... How many of these?
[80:36.94]You want more than one of those?
[80:38.20]You don't have a big enough house for this.
[80:47.41]And then a table.
[80:48.25]You don't have a big enough house!
[80:49.51]You can't have all this stuff!
[81:03.72]Got it.
[81:08.08]This person's fucked if it rains.
[81:09.82]That's what I'm saying.
[81:10.32]I felt like I was going to put something up here.
[81:16.76]I thought we were going to... That's why I was curious why I had somebody, you know, numbers.
[81:20.58]I thought we were going to go tarp or something.
[81:24.24]That looks pretty good.
[81:26.20]Cool.
[81:28.39]$7,000.
[81:30.21]Soggy table, soggy chairs.
[81:31.33]That's right.
[81:35.41]This looks like shit, but it's not.
[81:37.05]Who cares?
[81:38.79]I got lots of money.
[81:39.71]I just don't spend it.
[81:42.35]I'm gonna be one of those people that just has a million dollars, but doesn't ever buy anything.
[81:49.30]You just have it.
[81:50.76]You open up, like, your bank account and just look at it and go, cool.
[81:58.60]Alright, what's this one?
[82:03.85]Hi there.
[82:04.29]Mommy left for a few months.
[82:06.68]When she returns, I will tell her that the flowers, unfortunately, have rotted because I watered them too often.
[82:13.96]In the meantime, you have to cut them out and plant my favorite plants.
[82:17.46]Quinces, wine grapes, etc.
[82:20.11]You can leave the flowers that are at the front of the house so that she won't notice anything when she returns.
[82:24.57]All her flowers in the backyard have to disappear.
[82:26.71]That's my spot.
[82:28.69]Hope you can do that.
[82:29.53]Can't you?
[82:30.31]See ya.
[82:32.72]What the fuck is going on here?
[82:37.06]What kind of Willy Wonka chocolate room kind of shit is this?
[82:46.48]Uh... Don't get involved in this.
[82:50.61]Wait, what was it?
[82:51.93]Leave the ones at the front, right?
[83:00.99]This is a nice garden.
[83:01.93]No, no, no, no.
[83:02.79]I don't like this.
[83:03.23]This gives me anxiety.
[83:05.33]This is like anxiety here.
[83:07.23]I don't like this.
[83:07.67]I don't know.
[83:14.11]It just does.
[83:14.51]I don't know something about it.
[83:15.49]I don't like it.
[83:16.91]Too much.
[83:17.21]Just give me one giant cactus and that's it.
[83:19.05]I don't want all this other stuff.
[83:22.17]I feel like they're all looking at me.
[83:23.95]They're all like alive and shit.
[83:26.27]I'm sorry.
[83:26.75]Okay.
[83:36.13]I mean, they are alive.
[83:38.31]No, just, I want one huge cactus.
[83:41.95]And then a big aloe vera plant.
[83:45.52]And... Maybe like a couple other cactuses.
[83:50.68]How many, any more weeds?
[83:53.22]Yeah, there's still weeds everywhere.
[84:00.11]Any more weeds back here? 65%.
[84:09.01]Eating cactus.
[84:11.69]That shit will keep you alive, man.
[84:12.88]Alright, anymore weeds.
[84:19.04]Weeds, weeds, weeds, weeds.
[84:21.04]This is a nice table.
[84:25.60]Those don't even look like weeds.
[84:26.56]Those look like nice flowers.
[84:27.66]Okay, almost done with that.
[84:35.42]The hunt for weeds, yeah.
[84:41.97]Right here?
[84:43.92]Is there a weed scanner?
[84:44.88]I don't have the skill point.
[84:54.44]Well, I'll get back to it.
[84:55.27]Alright.
[84:56.35]So I need to plant two cornice, remove weeds, and then plant... Okay, I need a... a chan... chanlamay?
[85:08.20]Okay.
[85:10.51]Cornus Mastus.
[85:13.17]Cornus.
[85:16.88]So how many do you want?
[85:17.66]A few of these, right?
[85:18.66]Two of these?
[85:19.90]Why do you want these fucking huge trees?
[85:28.14]Can these go over here?
[85:29.53]Yeah.
[85:31.03]No.
[85:31.63]Cherry tree?
[85:32.87]You want to put this over here.
[85:33.97]What are you?
[85:36.69]What are you?
[85:37.11]Dumb?
[85:38.37]What are you?
[85:38.63]Dumb?
[85:39.81]You dumb?
[85:41.53]What are you... Okay.
[85:56.90]And in three channel minutes... How big are these?
[86:04.97]These are ugly, too.
[86:07.07]Why would you remove your mother's nice plants?
[86:15.20]I swear.
[86:15.66]Fucking zoomers, man.
[86:19.46]I wanna put this, like, back here.
[86:29.45]Not enough space?
[86:30.11]I'm moving this shit.
[86:30.97]There's gonna be enough space.
[86:32.25]But who cares?
[86:32.83]It is just a tutorial.
[86:35.55]It is just a tutorial.
[86:36.65]It is just a tutorial.
[86:38.73]It's weird to say that.
[86:39.47]It's like too many T's in that sentence.
[86:42.67]It's just a tutorial.
[86:46.31]How many of these?
[86:47.15]Three?
[86:57.24]What about back here?
[86:59.04]These kind of need to be together, don't they?
[87:00.38]Yeah, this would look dumb if they're not together.
[87:02.80]Okay, and then... That's three, then three ribs...
[87:16.42]Ribs, R-I-B-E-S.
[87:19.68]You want three of these.
[87:20.40]Wait, there was a color change there.
[87:23.23]Species.
[87:23.67]Uh, let's do... Let's do the red.
[87:34.01]These are gonna go in the front.
[87:38.57]Why are you saying sh-be?
[87:41.47]Why?
[87:41.69]Why?
[87:47.81]Come on, I can fit one more here.
[87:51.37]Right... here... somewhere, come on.
[87:54.57]Nice.
[87:56.55]Alright, plant.
[88:04.25]He said the thing.
[88:07.27]Yeah, I say the thing all the time.
[88:10.16]I think I've said the word shpee more in the last two months than I have in the last five years.
[88:26.49]He said it again.
[88:29.27]Just full of surprises these days.
[88:30.71]Alright, let's plant this.
[88:39.56]We have to say it with the voice.
[88:45.68]No, I don't have to do that.
[88:46.74]No, I don't gotta do it.
[88:51.06]You can do it.
[88:51.57]You try it.
[89:03.52]I don't like the way this looks.
[89:04.42]That's three, then I gotta plant these over here.
[89:14.10]Let's just do the big tree.
[89:16.40]First, to get it out of the way.
[89:18.21]This is gonna take forever to dig, isn't it?
[89:26.47]How long does it take to dig a hole this big?
[89:28.77]I don't think I've ever dug a hole like this before.
[89:35.75]Every time I've ever tried to dig a hole, I always get into that, oh yeah, I'm gonna dig a hole.
[89:41.00]You get like a, not even a foot down and it's impossible.
[89:43.20]You just can't do it anymore.
[89:52.17]You like hit, you hit like obsidian.
[89:54.59]It's like, you can't go.
[90:05.24]Where's the plant?
[90:09.58]I don't know why.
[90:10.14]It's weird.
[90:10.66]It's like it hardens up.
[90:16.08]Rocks and shit.
[90:16.76]Yeah, I don't know.
[90:17.76]How do people dig holes without an actual device to do it?
[90:22.91]Some of you guys are strong.
[90:29.39]I'm kind of a wuss.
[90:40.22]This chat is so easy to manipulate.
[90:42.30]It's crazy.
[90:47.38]I didn't say that.
[90:48.04]Somebody did.
[90:48.58]I didn't say that.
[90:52.32]Somebody said that and I'm just reading it.
[90:58.91]I said it.
[91:03.33]Soil.
[91:05.07]Ah.
[91:12.34]Just say pog, and we will all spam pog.
[91:18.18]Yeah, but I mean, this goes both ways.
[91:20.79]Because if somebody puts a fish on the end of their comment, I'm going to read it out loud.
[91:27.97]Remember?
[91:29.07]So this works both ways.
[91:36.90]We tested that theory a while ago.
[91:41.39]There's still weeds over here.
[91:42.91]That looks alright.
[91:44.81]Ooh.
[91:46.57]No, this is bad.
[91:47.73]Bad placement.
[91:48.81]Let's cut that one down.
[91:56.48]Where are these other weeds?
[91:59.28]Come on, weeds.
[92:01.38]Oh, look at how much more of this shit there is.
[92:03.06]I gotta fill the pool up.
[92:11.30]I remember having an above ground pool and this is what you did.
[92:17.45]You had to just put the hose in there and just let it run.
[92:20.81]It took like three weeks.
[92:29.22]Now these pools come assembled and they come with water in them.
[92:33.54]A company comes with a big truck and just dumps it in there.
[92:43.50]It takes like 20 hours.
[92:44.79]Yeah, spread over like five days.
[92:46.35]You can't water that in a row like that.
[92:50.73]That's like, that's not allowed.
[92:54.87]So you do like a couple gallons a day and it took like two or three months.
[93:06.94]Found the weeds.
[93:14.30]Yeah, because if there was, like, a water van, the water police would show up.
[93:26.57]At that point, just take a bath.
[93:27.74]Are you putting...
[93:38.21]Why does it take so long?
[93:39.07]Are you putting it through a Brita filter first?
[93:42.77]There's some sick fuck that does that.
[93:45.19]You know it.
[93:46.03]I don't even have to fucking pretend it's not real.
[93:49.00]There's some, like, weirdo that has, like, purified water in their pool.
[93:56.22]They, like, filter it first and then they put it in the pool.
[94:04.92]In case they get thirsty.
[94:05.88]Yeah, you can just go underwater and just go... It's actually kind of fucking cool.
[94:18.78]That's actually pretty cool.
[94:23.77]If I ever had like a fucking hundred billion dollars, I'd have a purified Brita pool.
[94:32.69]And every month, I would have another pool behind it.
[94:37.81]And then we'd just get a giant Brita filter, and then filter the water every few months, and dump it into the other pool.
[94:44.65]And then have that one cleaned.
[94:45.61]I think that's good with weeds.
[94:52.27]Well, wait.
[94:52.99]I just cut those down.
[94:54.19]Those aren't weeds.
[94:56.31]Those are nice.
[94:56.81]Oops.
[95:00.50]Alright, now we have to do plant 10 Bacchus.
[95:04.44]Yeah, get these out of here.
[95:08.76]10 Bacchus plants.
[95:14.23]This is going to take a million years.
[95:15.59]10 of these? 3...
[95:35.25]I don't think I ever did any work like this before.
[95:44.41]Can I get some PogChamps in the chat, please, for that?
[95:50.60]Never, no.
[95:51.30]I have such soft, unused hands.
[95:57.94]I'm the kind of person that, if I pick up a bunch of sand in my hands, I might start to bleed.
[96:07.50]They're just unused.
[96:12.11]Now, we're gonna do this in waves here.
[96:20.93]You need to use them.
[96:25.13]Much like... I'm not gonna read that one, but, like, alright.
[96:30.01]Settle down.
[96:39.29]Alright, let's just go for it.
[96:45.92]See, some of you guys that have, like, fucking unwashed hands, you'll know.
[96:51.42]You know how long this takes to do?
[96:54.54]This should take... Doing this would take, like, three weeks.
[96:59.75]You could fill a pool in that time.
[97:21.76]Somebody just wrote, what are you talking about?
[97:24.42]I love it.
[97:32.82]Local old man has no concept of time.
[97:34.80]Yes, I do.
[97:35.40]I was actually going to buy a watch.
[97:40.44]And no, I'm not talking about, I'm going to get a Rolex.
[97:42.86]No, no, I'm going to get like a Walmart fucking like 1999 watch.
[97:54.16]An Apple Watch?
[97:55.65]No.
[97:57.75]I'm not going to get an Apple Watch.
[97:58.81]I would wash my hands in the bathroom and it would break.
[98:01.85]I would seriously... I would just forget it was on and I would wash my hands and the water would get all over it.
[98:22.98]Yeah, you have to just get one of those really, really just cheapo ones.
[98:35.69]That would happen for any other watch.
[98:37.90]Yeah, I know, but there's a difference between a, like, $600 watch and a $15 watch that, if you break it, you just go, ah, oh well.
[98:49.82]Instead of going, oh, oh, no, oh, oh, no!
[99:09.02]Get some water resistant.
[99:09.82]You could get water resistant, right?
[99:11.24]But that's too much to think about.
[99:13.22]I'm just going to get the time tattooed on my stomach so I can look down and know what time it is.
[99:20.81]It's probably easier that way.
[99:21.73]I'm going to get them all in one go here.
[99:45.43]Tat- how- how cheap is a tattoo?
[99:49.35]Yeah, but that- okay, that- I make- I make that joke, but somebody somewhere has that so they can at the bar, you know, when it's like 10 28 p.m.
[100:01.52]They can lift up their fucking shirt and go, 10 28 p.m.
[100:06.64]And everyone goes like, what the f- Everyone's mouth curls into like that, oh!
[100:12.76]And then he like shotguns a beer.
[100:19.16]Somebody out there has that.
[100:22.72]And it's like digital clock format too, so it's even more like a fuck off, you know what I mean?
[100:39.22]That's literally me.
[100:47.34]That's, like, an interesting idea, though.
[100:48.96]Backtracking!
[100:51.92]I can hear it.
[100:52.94]I can feel the backtrack coming out of my mouth.
[101:02.13]Okay, so that's done.
[101:04.33]Nice.
[101:07.57]You didn't hear what I just said?
[101:08.27]I was like, that's, like, a cool idea, though.
[101:10.81]Because somebody just said that I have that, and then I got, like, scared.
[101:13.30]I was like, oh, hopefully he's not mad.
[101:17.48]Oh, faster planting.
[101:18.72]Faster digging.
[101:19.94]Ugh.
[101:21.52]Yeah, faster planting.
[101:22.46]I got two.
[101:24.38]Let's get the better shovel.
[101:29.79]What's the shovel look like?
[101:31.17]I want to see it.
[101:31.65]Alright, medium pear tree.
[101:35.65]Medium cherry tree.
[101:41.26]So, medium cherry tree.
[101:45.06]Need two of these.
[101:48.08]Let's go over here.
[101:52.12]Let's put the fruit together.
[101:53.20]You know, right in the back there.
[101:55.97]And the other side over here.
[102:00.27]That's not bad placement.
[102:04.37]That looks... I think that looks okay.
[102:05.84]Okay.
[102:10.29]I've never played it.
[102:11.91]Not once.
[102:13.57]But I was going to make like a... Okay, now start Dota auto-chests and have them... I don't know.
[102:19.54]Somebody might be able to come up with something from there.
[102:27.06]They had to be over here.
[102:27.80]That's unfortunate.
[102:38.29]Oh well.
[102:39.05]I got plenty of money.
[102:42.95]I'm forcing chat to make your jokes for you.
[102:46.17]I never said I was making it.
[102:47.75]I was just like... thinking about it.
[102:50.76]It's a good shovel.
[102:56.12]These cherry trees aren't going to get any sun.
[102:57.68]There they are.
[103:15.89]Why do the cherry trees look like palm trees?
[103:20.65]Yeah, they kind of do.
[103:21.23]You're right.
[103:24.19]Mod that guy.
[103:25.63]Fucking mod that guy right now.
[103:27.67]He's right.
[103:28.05]Alright, medium pear tree.
[103:39.11]Ooh, this is cool.
[103:49.09]I'm just kidding, it's not going over there.
[103:51.23]I just saw so many people, like, grab their monitors with both hands and rip it into their face and scream.
[104:00.57]Oh, let's put it right here, it's fine.
[104:02.09]Alright, we still need to mow the lawn.
[104:06.43]Two medium plum trees are gonna go one, two.
[104:12.15]Medium plum tree.
[104:14.24]Medium.
[104:16.92]Medium.
[104:18.10]Where is it?
[104:20.19]Medium... Plum tree.
[104:22.69]What the hell?
[104:28.65]Medium... Plum tree.
[104:30.15]How did it not show up?
[104:37.76]Alright.
[104:39.24]Let's do it.
[104:44.98]This is the most boring garden placement.
[104:48.39]What do you mean?
[104:48.99]I think it looks good.
[104:50.23]Okay, it is just kind of... Tree, tree, tree, tree, tree, tree.
[105:00.51]It's on the edges, you're right.
[105:02.03]This is kind of a boring placement.
[105:04.15]I told you, I'm not very good at this, though.
[105:06.41]I'm pretty good at smashing stuff with a hammer.
[105:09.19]If you need a guy to take down a wall with a sledgehammer with anger, just leave it to me.
[105:14.83]I'll take care of that.
[105:17.05]If you want loud sounds, I can make those.
[105:20.03]With my mouth.
[105:24.53]Did I get the job?
[105:32.13]Okay, so that's still weeds.
[105:41.25]Why does it sound like static?
[105:45.94]I don't know.
[105:51.12]I have absolutely no idea.
[105:54.02]No, that's not how it works.
[105:56.94]It doesn't just stop.
[106:00.58]I seriously... Everybody would just... It gets to a point when the power of the devices that you power in your house.
[106:12.97]So if you have two sockets, use the...
[106:20.27]Don't put anything in there.
[106:24.97]Did you guys get that?
[106:35.44]Nice.
[106:35.74]Alright, now let's, like, fucking stomp.
[106:41.44]With, like, big boots on.
[106:42.66]Alright, so we good?
[106:44.14]No, I still need to move weeds.
[106:49.30]Pool weeds, not cool.
[107:00.26]Where are they?
[107:01.82]It's getting dark out.
[107:03.09]This task has taken me all day to complete.
[107:05.55]Lawn.
[107:07.37]Alright, I got the lawn mode.
[107:14.05]There's still weeds somewhere.
[107:23.01]Hmm.
[107:25.09]Anybody see weeds?
[107:27.09]Ah.
[107:27.43]No, those are not weeds.
[107:29.73]Where are these?
[107:30.31]Weeds could be flowers, though.
[107:31.55]I can't tell.
[107:32.15]I haven't seen anything.
[107:41.48]Don't ignore us.
[107:44.08]What are you on about?
[107:44.80]This whole job was $2,000.
[107:46.70]What a piece of crap. 99%.
[107:52.65]Oh.
[107:53.54]Just like Cox's uptime, in quotes.
[108:04.73]That's actually what they say.
[108:05.73]Alright, um... I got a lot of bugs in my house.
[108:09.53]No, I'm leaving it like that.
[108:11.05]Oh yeah, that we destroyed these walls.
[108:18.26]No, I like this stuff.
[108:19.10]I'm keeping it.
[108:20.71]Alright, there might be time to... I think we know what we're doing here.
[108:25.15]One little thing to complete my part of heaven.
[108:27.79]I feel like this is what?
[108:29.11]Is there any other tools that I have not figured out?
[108:35.99]Buy the Home Alone house.
[108:37.15]Well, not yet.
[108:37.89]Hold on.
[108:38.21]I need to make sure there's any tools that I can use.
[108:43.11]Why is the music so... The music's not scary.
[108:48.48]Why is the music scary?
[108:49.98]What are you talking about?
[108:54.96]I should be back home by the end of the week.
[108:56.00]I just need some rest when I get back, and I think that the mess in my garden might make me nervous.
[109:00.30]See?
[109:00.58]I don't even have this garden, and it's fucking already making this person, like, nervous and have anxiety.
[109:08.41]I feel the same way.
[109:09.45]I want to hire your company again to put my garden in order, and please take care of the lawn.
[109:12.39]It hasn't been mowed for ages.
[109:20.10]Oh dear.
[109:21.62]Alright, okay, hold on.
[109:22.98]Can I go in your house?
[109:25.26]You won't even let me go in the house?
[109:27.38]What if I need to use the bathroom?
[109:38.51]So I just pee on the bushes?
[109:40.27]Alright, let's get this out.
[109:40.99]Alright, I'm gonna do this very efficiently.
[109:44.38]Because I gotta mow the whole lawn.
[109:48.72]What am I going to get for this?
[109:50.46]Like... 20 bucks?
[109:51.80]Because that's... Okay, when I used to door-to-door be a lawnmower salesman, I would mow lawns when I was younger.
[109:58.45]And you got $20 to do the person's entire yard.
[110:01.51]Was it worth it?
[110:02.25]Let's see.
[110:17.42]Okay, so this is what I was paid for.
[110:22.14]Was I getting advantage taken of me?
[110:29.93]Yeah, there you go, son.
[110:31.11]There's your $20 bill.
[110:35.05]Thanks for the back-breaking fucking four and a half hours of work.
[110:41.10]That's $20, so you can take that to the arcade.
[110:44.30]Yeah, I can take it to the arcade.
[110:45.46]Yeah, you can take it to the arcade.
[110:46.52]Thank you for the arcade, buddy.
[110:48.56]Mr. Stewart?
[110:53.02]Is the name that I'm being given on the stream pretend person joke?
[110:58.30]This is not doing it.
[110:58.98]I know.
[111:13.12]Why are you mowing a lawn with a weed whacker?
[111:15.10]Because I can't- I don't have a lawn mower.
[111:21.93]This thing sucks.
[111:25.77]You're using a corner edger to mow an entire lawn.
[111:33.01]Imagine looking out the window and seeing this sorry ass guy out here just mowing with an edger.
[111:47.36]I don't have access to a lawnmower.
[111:53.10]Coming soon.
[111:58.09]I don't think there is a lawnmower.
[112:07.71]It's not in the game yet.
[112:14.92]Oh, garden flipper.
[112:21.99]Am I going to E3 this year?
[112:23.68]I don't know.
[112:27.08]Didn't everybody back out of E3?
[112:28.70]It's like everybody backed out of that one dude's birthday party.
[112:36.76]He passed out invitations to everybody, and like one of the cool kids isn't going.
[112:41.79]So then all of a sudden you get like, oh man, I can't go, I'm sick.
[112:45.71]And then you end up with just like your two or three close friends that go.
[112:59.92]And you rented out the whole laser tag arena.
[113:02.32]It was going to be really cool.
[113:05.86]You have this vision in your mind of two teams of like 15 people on each team.
[113:19.68]Not the laser tag again.
[113:26.02]That just kind of reminds me, does anybody else do this?
[113:29.22]Where, so you've like a trip or something that you've like wanted to do or planned for a long time.
[113:33.98]You have all these like ideas of how it's gonna go.
[113:35.66]Like go to like a water park or like Disney World or something.
[113:39.41]And you go, you have, you think about like weeks in advance.
[113:42.41]Like all this shit that you're gonna do.
[113:44.67]And how much fucking fun it's going to be.
[113:47.25]And how amazing.
[113:48.60]You're gonna try this.
[113:49.42]And you're gonna try that.
[113:50.20]This restaurant seems cool.
[113:51.44]But try that one.
[113:52.66]And then you get there and you do like two things.
[113:54.44]And you're like, this is stupid.
[113:56.58]This sucks.
[114:03.08]Or like, oh, this is, this is like, okay, I guess.
[114:07.32]And you've spent weeks before, man, I can't, we're gonna, I can't even try, this is gonna be so awesome!
[114:11.63]And you have the thing, you're like, oh, this is, yeah, that's alright.
[114:23.56]The most fun just kind of happens when you just don't even, you accidentally have it.
[114:28.69]It's like you go to the Disney World and instead of the ride that you wanted to ride and getting off it and being like, that was fun.
[114:36.23]No, no, there's like a clown in the street that's like juggling and you love it.
[114:39.62]And you're like, this is fucking great.
[114:41.20]That's the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
[114:43.92]It's those moments.
[114:58.49]That's why I don't have a schedule, and I don't stream that much.
[115:01.40]He's gonna tie it back into streams.
[115:11.22]You know, it makes sense, doesn't it?
[115:15.93]It just makes sense to me.
[115:24.75]This amusement park sucks.
[115:32.06]You know when you get a game, and you're really excited for the DLC, because it's like gardening, and wow, I'm so excited for this, I'm writing down all these things I want to do, and how much fun it's going to be to plant and garden, wow, planting cherry trees, and then you start mowing a lawn, and you kind of realize, eh.
[116:04.12]Stop sputterwalking?
[116:06.04]What do you do?
[116:06.52]What is sputterwalking?
[116:11.00]I feel like... Is that... Is that sputterwalking?
[116:13.44]Like... I have to, because look, it doesn't... Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[116:18.81]Watch.
[116:19.05]Ready?
[116:20.65]It doesn't get it all.
[116:21.93]You see?
[116:22.17]Look behind me.
[116:22.63]There's like... I have to sputterwalk.
[116:27.13]Because it doesn't get it all.
[116:29.71]Stop sputterwalking.
[116:32.50]Ah.
[116:32.82]See?
[116:33.10]Look.
[116:34.16]See?
[116:35.01]Look it!
[116:36.67]Look, I have to do it again.
[116:37.87]Second pass.
[116:39.47]I wanted to get it all in one pass.
[116:40.41]What do you mean he doesn't know?
[116:42.07]No, it doesn't look.
[116:43.17]Are you looking?
[116:44.63]Look, look, are you looking?
[116:47.26]Look it.
[116:49.14]It just did it.
[116:52.10]Look!
[116:52.44]Are you looking?
[116:54.44]See?
[116:54.56]See?
[117:03.89]Look!
[117:05.15]It's not done.
[117:06.79]Right here.
[117:10.13]See, look at that.
[117:11.35]Fuck, I'm wrong.
[117:12.93]Am I wrong?
[117:15.05]Because it looks like it's not cutting them all down.
[117:21.72]Fuck, I'm wrong.
[117:25.24]I thought it was not cutting all of them down.
[117:28.74]God damn it, I hate being wrong.
[117:30.74]No, I'm not wrong.
[117:31.50]I'm not wrong.
[117:32.54]Fuck, I hate, I can't be wrong.
[117:34.44]No, I can't be wrong about anything.
[117:38.08]No, it's actually somehow you're wrong.
[117:41.62]And I'm going to explain with insane jumping through hoops to figure out a way that you're wrong and I'm right.
[117:47.62]Because I can't be wrong.
[117:48.50]That's not possible.
[117:49.62]No way.
[117:51.52]Never.
[117:51.74]I've never been wrong in my life.
[117:59.25]I mean, maybe one time, well, I, like, I paid for something, and it was, like, $1.80, and I gave the guy, like, $2.20, and, like, I fucked up.
[118:09.49]I mean, that's, like, everybody does that, though.
[118:24.46]I was right.
[118:26.02]I was right.
[118:28.44]I'm right.
[118:34.83]I'm right.
[118:39.25]Look at how right I am.
[118:40.19]Do you see?
[118:43.11]Watch this, ready?
[118:48.33]Look at how right I was.
[118:50.37]Told you guys, I've only been one to my wife.
[118:56.12]I didn't miss!
[119:01.20]You can't miss.
[119:05.91]Spudder streamer.
[119:07.57]No, I'm not.
[119:08.55]Look at how clean this looks.
[119:09.67]This only took $375 worth of money.
[119:16.11]Look at the mini-map you missed.
[119:17.19]We'll determine that at a later date.
[119:24.03]God, I'm so glad that I won that argument.
[119:30.09]Feels great.
[119:38.31]Hydrate, idiot.
[119:40.06]See, now we're just having a normal discussion and you have to bring this mean behavior in.
[119:45.06]Come on.
[119:45.74]See what I'm talking about?
[119:46.78]Like, I had them right, too.
[119:49.02]Ugh.
[119:49.96]Come on.
[120:04.84]I'll take a break here in a minute.
[120:06.02]Just relax.
[120:06.40]We're fine.
[120:12.14]It's like arguing with your mom.
[120:15.74]There's so many of these.
[120:16.84]I just... Can we just use fire instead?
[120:26.13]Can I, like... I think I might have been wrong.
[120:33.23]Maybe.
[120:33.51]It's possible, but, you know.
[120:34.99]I don't think so, though.
[120:42.13]I mean, I was the lead in my school play.
[120:44.03]How could I ever be fucking wrong about anything?
[120:52.26]But one time I threw a pass, a 40-yard pass.
[120:58.12]How the fuck could I ever be wrong?
[120:59.68]I mean, I did that once.
[121:15.44]I got it all!
[121:15.96]I did it!
[121:24.67]Wait, I didn't get this part.
[121:25.73]There's one little strip here.
[121:26.67]Alright, that's good.
[121:34.19]That's good.
[121:35.09]Look at that.
[121:35.65]420 bucks.
[121:51.83]Just give me a second.
[122:31.77]Hey.
[123:02.92]Ah, okay, this is like this?
[123:04.06]I'm running out of space!
[123:38.85]No, not always riot, always right.
[123:48.56]Always .
[123:49.94]Always riot.
[123:58.82]Oh, imagine coming here to this house.
[124:01.11]This is always right.
[124:07.38]You spent that much time riding that, but you didn't mow your whole lawn.
[124:15.28]I feel like this is the kind of person that would have, like, 40 bumper stickers.
[124:28.58]Riot.
[124:33.28]So, okay, I was partially wrong.
[124:36.89]You want to know why?
[124:39.34]Here's why you were partially wrong.
[124:41.52]Because if I'm putting... That's how I'm going to spin it.
[124:43.78]Check this out.
[124:44.32]Ready?
[124:45.06]If I'm pointing straight down like this, yes, it gets it all.
[124:49.12]But if I have it up a little, it's not cutting.
[124:51.42]And I didn't know that.
[124:52.82]I thought it didn't matter what the angle was.
[124:55.58]So you were partially wrong.
[124:56.90]And I was always right.
[125:10.31]Alright, I think it's time to buy a house.
[125:11.85]I think I know.
[125:12.35]I know what to do.
[125:14.49]Browser.
[125:14.93]Look at all the money I have.
[125:19.18]Let's do a little fixer-upper for purchase.

[126:12.34]No, I'm not going to a million miles per hour.

[128:04.15]Take a mental note of what you see right here.
[128:05.55]I put away the tool.

[129:17.98]He was coming to fight me.
[129:19.00]Did you see that?
[129:19.34]He was like trying to bite me in the legs.
[129:26.25]Yeah.
[129:27.91]What a wuss.
[129:29.39]Trying to prove that I'm not a wuss.
[129:39.17]All these cans.
[129:43.25]Okay, look, I can't imagine.
[129:46.81]This is like your bedroom right here, right?
[129:48.78]Or like right here.
[129:50.44]Can you imagine just throwing cans of soda out your open window?
[129:57.64]What are they doing?
[130:00.62]Don't you have a trash can?
[130:03.71]The window's open and you're just like throwing it out the window.
[130:20.66]If I ever threw a can on the ground, it would cause me physical pain.
[130:28.66]Not only because of the ability to scrape the DNA off of the mouth part.
[130:35.55]I'm not, you know, fuck that.
[130:37.89]Not only being able to cotton swab the top of that and fucking get me.
[130:47.28]but that it's rude and bad.
[130:48.48]And if you think I'm making that up, oh, look at the question marks.
[130:51.66]What the fuck is this weirdo streamer talking about?
[130:54.17]There was somebody that found, like, gum all over the ground and shit and picked up random stuff and did DNA testing on it and made people out of it.
[131:07.18]They, like, went and got gum and, like, tested it and made what they think of the person looked like.
[131:14.84]I swear to God, this is real.
[131:18.81]They did like a police sketch of these, of what the people looked like.
[131:24.83]That is true.
[131:25.57]Yes, it is.
[131:34.35]No, I'm not having an episode.
[131:35.65]This is... What do you mean, what am I having an episode?
[131:39.80]No, no, no, I'm not saying they made a human out of finding gum in the trash.
[131:44.16]I'm saying that somebody did a scientific research thing where they took samples from stuff in the trash and gum that was chewed up underneath seats and shit, and they did a DNA genetic code of what that person may look like.
[132:02.63]What if you're on there?
[132:03.63]What if that's you?
[132:10.18]That's so interesting.
[132:13.72]That cloning experience.
[132:16.54]I remember reading about that, like, years ago.
[132:21.55]I didn't say, what, clone?
[132:22.75]No, I didn't say cloning.
[132:23.83]I said that there's, like, that's research.
[132:33.69]We already know what you look like.
[132:35.27]No, you don't.
[132:36.29]You didn't go, like, find gum.
[132:46.55]That's an episode of Black Mirror?
[132:48.51]No, no, this is like actual scientific research.
[132:58.13]Hold on, stay right there.
[133:00.31]Nobody move.
[133:16.60]yeah it's for real this shit is science guys it's not a pre-recorded joke
[133:42.37]Cite your source.
[133:43.97]The American Institute of Collegiate Scientific Discovery.
[133:49.31]Yes, I know that sounds like a shell company.
[133:51.24]For, like, a bit of money.
[133:52.58]Like, launder money.
[134:12.05]The article and or researcher.
[134:14.03]Hold on, let me see if I can find this.
[134:15.75]I remember this was so fascinating.
[134:30.24]Hold on.
[134:39.32]I got it.
[134:40.64]got it got it got it got it got it it's from the smithsonian are you gonna are you gonna not say that the smithsonian does like something interesting yeah like from cigarette butts and they can like map out a face this is me
[135:09.56]Smithsonian, Smithsonian mag.
[135:11.74]A zine.
[135:12.90]It's from thesmithsonian.com.
[135:18.14]All you have to do... I'm not gonna, like, break the Smithsonian website.
[135:24.84]If you want to figure out for yourself, you just have to type in, pulling DNA from gum, what they look like, into Google, and you'll find it.
[135:32.89]Thanks.
[135:38.76]Always wrong though, right?
[135:40.30]What does it say in my front line?
[135:42.92]What does it say in my front line?
[135:45.52]This is actual research.
[135:58.25]It's the goddamn Smithsonian.
[136:08.53]Use it as a retort for everything.
[136:12.37]Always... How did we even get to, like, the Smithsonian, like, research?
[136:28.98]I work for the Smithsonian.
[136:29.87]Thanks for giving us the shout-out.
[136:31.01]Yeah, it's fucking great!
[136:33.13]Absolutely.
[136:34.29]Really interesting, really cool research.
[136:35.83]For real.
[136:36.49]Like, it's really cool shit.
[136:41.94]Wait, didn't I start by saying that I was terrified of that?
[136:45.18]No, I'm not.
[136:45.74]That's cool shit.
[136:46.96]What?
[136:57.85]But imagine if you, like, saw your face.
[137:05.19]I do actually think it's pretty cool, though.
[137:06.79]For real.
[137:09.45]A little bullshit.
[137:25.26]I'd rather not see my face.
[137:29.90]Well, of course we shout out signs on this channel.
[137:32.36]It's very interesting stuff.
[137:41.44]I don't leave hair... Yes, you do.
[137:45.27]What are you talking about?
[137:45.91]You know you... You know you shed like 150 hairs a day?
[137:48.39]What do you mean?
[137:54.17]If you have a head of hair, you shed 150 hairs a day.
[138:01.36]Your hair is everywhere.
[138:02.08]Oh, I'm spudderwalking again.
[138:09.34]Is a SpaceX launch tonight?
[138:11.39]That's nice.
[138:12.21]Alright, I'm kind of just like talking.
[138:20.79]I need to like focus.
[138:24.23]That's a free haircut every single day, that's true.
[138:42.80]How do they know it's my hair, nerd?
[138:45.83]Well, if science ever gets to a point where they can genetically take your entire code from that hair, they'll be able to know that, yeah, you ordered four Big Macs last night, you were in line at that McDonald's, and you got four Big Macs.
[139:04.18]You can't hide that anymore.
[139:10.87]They'll have, like, some Big Mac juice saliva and you, like, that dripped out onto the ground.
[139:18.77]And they'll be able to tell the quantity of Big Macs that you ate because of the, like, enzymes in your saliva.
[139:23.39]Give it, like, another 500 years.
[139:24.79]Oh.
[139:29.42]Did they get me?
[139:36.58]Did they get me?
[139:37.08]Uh-oh.
[139:47.56]We were alright for a little while.
[139:51.26]I think we're good.
[139:55.46]Quantity of Big Macs.
[139:56.54]How many Big Macs do you eat?
[139:57.34]Well, it depends.
[139:59.54]I mean, it depends on how hungry I am, what's the scenario, my... Has it ever been, like, streaming or whatever?
[140:07.66]Oh, no.
[140:09.99]My stream is sputterwalking.
[140:13.33]Yeah, it was kind of inevitable, because they didn't do anything.
[140:16.83]And I was told that maybe as of... we'd have a static IP later today... Uh-oh.
[140:22.35]I think it's actually just 0.
[140:29.38]Holy shit, that was bad.
[140:36.18]Hold on, let me send a text.
[140:45.03]We good?
[140:46.25]I'm supposed to text somebody when it's like really bad.
[140:59.85]Hold on, give me a second.
[141:01.51]Give me one second.
[141:06.51]I would call this bad.
[141:16.08]I would call this... Not good.
[141:21.97]Is it worth it?
[141:22.77]I feel like I got my hand on the emergency line, and I feel like I don't want to pick it up and be like, Help me, please!
[141:29.35]And they're like, There's nothing there.
[141:32.03]I don't want to be like the boy who cried frames.
[141:38.38]Do we get a raid?
[141:41.88]Oh, shit.
[141:42.82]We do have a raid.
[141:44.74]Hello, everybody.
[141:47.08]Hopefully we stay connected to the internet.
[141:52.16]Uh, that's from, uh, Robaz?
[141:55.72]Robaz?
[142:02.03]Robaz?
[142:03.03]Robaz?
[142:13.89]Now, I know, I know who Robaz is.
[142:20.39]But thank you so much.
[142:21.25]That's an old YouTuber.
[142:30.44]King of... King of the castle.
[142:34.78]No, king of the... He's an old YouTuber.
[142:45.93]Robo has been around for a long time.
[142:49.50]But thank you.
[142:49.94]Welcome, everybody.
[142:51.08]Hopefully we stay on connected.
[142:55.93]Why am I not cutting this?
[143:02.97]Ah, yes.
[143:03.43]The castle.
[143:10.42]But yeah, we're playing House Flipper.
[143:11.76]Currently fighting the internet.
[143:12.60]Hopefully you had a good stream.
[143:15.66]Thank you so much for the raid.
[143:19.72]What were you streaming?
[143:20.48]What were you doing?
[143:26.23]He beat getting over it.
[143:27.43]Are you serious?
[143:31.21]That's impossible.
[143:43.89]Wow, congratulations.
[143:44.77]That's insane.
[143:50.20]I think it's time to say, I gotta say, I gotta like pick up the emergency phone line here.
[143:58.79]I'm going for the emergency phone line.
[144:01.27]Wish me luck.
[144:19.01]Let's see.
[144:19.57]Hold on.
[144:27.57]I didn't know how long this stream was going to be and I hope we can actually keep it going for at least a little while longer.
[144:32.22]I got my hand on the button.
[144:34.76]I have a text written out.
[144:37.00]I have a text written out and I'm ready to press the button.
[144:46.75]I sent it.
[144:48.49]I sent it.
[144:49.83]I pressed it.
[144:56.95]It's been done.
[145:06.52]Let's see.
[145:07.38]Let's see if anything happens.
[145:19.63]I just got a text message.
[145:22.56]Well, hey, come on.
[145:23.82]Give me a hand here.
[145:30.50]No, I'll be right back.
[145:31.54]I'm calling.
[145:32.62]I'm going for it.
[145:34.11]No, text is not fast enough.
[145:35.13]I gotta do it.
[145:35.53]I'll be right back.
[145:38.67]I'm calling.
[145:39.09]I'll be right back.
[146:53.01]Thank you.
[147:13.80]Oh, that would happen, wouldn't it?
[147:16.31]Oh, god damn it.
[147:18.73]No.
[147:20.27]No.
[147:22.63]So, I've tried to call.
[147:27.21]Let me try to catch it.
[147:28.37]Call me when something happens.
[147:31.53]Their phone is off.
[147:36.47]It goes right to voicemail.
[147:38.64]And they didn't get the text either.
[147:40.00]Because it doesn't say delivered.
[147:41.34]Their phone is off.
[147:44.73]No, it's not.
[147:45.29]They're not closed.
[147:45.93]This is a direct line to somebody.
[147:48.01]This is somebody's, like, phone number.
[147:57.86]No!
[147:58.82]This is the opportunity!
[148:00.04]No!
[148:01.96]Charge your phone!
[148:03.40]What?
[148:03.68]I... Ugh!
[148:04.54]Damn it!
[148:05.40]Ugh...
[148:12.19]They called you.
[148:13.13]No, no, but that... No, no, that wasn't them.
[148:17.31]No, that wasn't them.
[148:19.63]I recognize... That was a different number.
[148:22.89]I have this person in my phone as, like, the Cox guy, and that's not who it was.
[148:29.97]Oh, well.
[148:30.49]It's okay.
[148:35.49]Uh, let's do... Let's do this.
[148:40.92]And faster digging.
[148:43.60]But after all, I just wanted to make sure I clearly state, everyone that came over from Robaz's channel, I kind of was in the middle of this bullshit, so... Thank you again for coming out, and again, thanks for the raid.
[149:00.13]I really appreciate it.
[149:05.66]Just wanted to make sure I got that out.
[149:07.44]Because I didn't know if we were dropping or not in the middle of me talking about it.
[149:14.83]I'm saying, I've got an accent, I can't help it.
[149:25.10]I don't think this is the end of the stream.
[149:28.92]No, we're good.
[149:29.89]It's alright, we'll be fine.
[149:32.97]Just, everyone, uh... Everybody just, at the same time, close your eyes and just think about how... Just think good thoughts here.
[149:58.58]The good thoughts aren't working here.
[150:01.09]But if we all use our, like, brain power, we can use our own 5G, 6G network to be able to fix this.
[150:13.61]Does everybody think, like, give me better internet right now?
[150:17.47]And, like, our brains have electromagnetic, uh, currents to them.
[150:24.19]We're gonna make our own, like, 7G network into this house.
[150:33.34]There's so much dead grass.
[150:46.30]I think it worked.
[150:49.80]Okay, now, like, a thousand of you, just dedicate yourselves to doing the brainpower thing.
[150:57.25]And we should be fine.
[151:02.77]I need to get these weeds.
[151:07.01]No.
[151:08.19]You don't have to do that.
[151:08.85]I'm kidding.
[151:16.01]I think it passed.
[151:19.71]Yeah.
[151:20.55]I think we're fine.
[151:23.89]You guys did it.
[151:26.44]You guys did it.
[151:28.56]You actually did it.
[151:43.91]I'm so proud of you guys.
[151:47.95]Maybe he got the text.
[151:53.10]I hope he wasn't eating like a pizza or something.
[151:54.98]Because if you're eating pizza, your hands, you can't really do anything.
[151:59.26]You've got greasy hands and you can't really help that.
[152:01.70]He's probably eating a pizza and I don't want to bother him.
[152:13.41]If you had, like, a deep dish pizza, would you want someone to, like, text you?
[152:16.92]No.
[152:18.08]You put your phone on silent until you're done.
[152:19.74]And you're gonna eat the whole fucking thing.
[152:23.42]That's fine.
[152:24.22]Don't tell- that- and then people are gonna be like, ooh, you ate a whole pizza.
[152:26.54]Don't- don't listen to them.
[152:28.55]It's okay.
[152:40.06]It's not healthy.
[152:44.01]I know.
[152:47.55]Look at all this grass.
[152:50.10]I'm gonna shape this place up, though.
[152:51.54]Just you wait.
[152:58.80]I want that lawnmower, though.
[153:01.50]Can I not get the lawnmower?
[153:07.85]I wish Jerma would text me.
[153:10.51]No, you don't want me to text you.
[153:13.20]Would be a bunch of nonsense.
[153:19.31]Alright, this house... Do the weeds grow back after a certain amount of time?
[153:29.32]I feel like they probably do.
[153:41.65]Come on, get in there, right in the middle.
[153:43.11]I'll get it later.
[153:44.85]Alright.
[153:46.21]So far, so good.
[153:48.69]Looking pretty damn good.
[153:52.45]A little bit on the edge here.
[153:58.95]I'll get it.
[153:59.97]I can't get it.
[154:01.56]No, I cannot get that.
[154:03.04]Yes, I can.
[154:09.83]Gotta get the roots or the weeds will never go away.
[154:14.19]I don't think this game is going that deep.
[154:18.53]The house is a piece of crap though.
[154:25.14]So many weeds and so much grass.
[154:37.17]Yeah, the house has to be renovated too.
[154:43.56]Alright, what if I just do the part that people see?
[154:47.25]Who cares, right?
[154:49.75]No one's going to look in this bush and see that there's grass in there.
[154:54.21]Who's going to do that?
[154:59.05]That's being lazy.
[155:00.15]Yeah, but... You don't have to do it all.
[155:09.34]Come on, get it.
[155:10.52]Almost done.
[155:13.45]He's being a lazy boy.
[155:17.17]All this crap.
[155:19.03]That's what it is.
[155:19.59]It's crap.
[155:21.09]Look at all this crap.
[155:28.39]Um... Get this junk out of here.
[155:32.51]Replace it with some cactuses.
[155:37.85]I want some light.
[155:42.75]You're gonna make a house with a dad in the bushes?
[155:44.65]I have to play the brain- I'm not gonna play the brain power song.
[155:55.85]No.
[155:58.51]No brain power.
[156:02.93]I don't want to overdo it, because you'll overload it.
[156:08.61]Can it be daylight, please?
[156:10.25]So I can get on with this project.
[156:20.95]Need more power.
[156:21.61]I need to zoom in here.
[156:23.11]With my seat.
[156:23.69]There we go.
[156:26.65]Let's open the door and see what we got working within the inside.
[156:28.81]I need lights.
[156:35.78]Ugly.
[156:37.96]Revolting.
[156:39.08]What's with the rooms in this house?
[156:40.52]Alright, give me some light.
[156:50.76]Uh, it doesn't matter.
[156:58.22]Ugh.
[157:02.32]I'm gonna replace him, but let's just buy a bunch.
[157:07.72]Can I put these outside?
[157:08.64]I need the light out here, temporarily.
[157:16.17]How do I turn these on?
[157:23.82]I need a light switch on the outside.
[157:30.48]Alright, here we go.
[157:33.78]What?
[157:35.16]Why?
[157:40.55]That doesn't control that?
[157:41.33]How is that possible?
[157:47.75]That's annoying.
[157:56.61]I forgot I had a flashlight.
[157:57.91]Thank you for the tip.
[158:05.99]No one's gonna see that.
[158:06.77]Alright, what about... I gotta clean this house up.
[158:10.87]I'm gonna be rolling out the green carpet here.
[158:13.48]Make sure I got enough... You know, get this all... Just get rid of all of it.
[158:19.20]Yeah, fuck that.
[158:20.52]Get out of here.
[158:21.00]I'll put it in myself.
[158:30.19]This looks like Left 4 Dead.
[158:32.01]It kinda does.
[158:33.61]You are right.
[158:34.19]Look at that last little thing there, come on!
[158:47.88]This game is seriously such- you could become such a perfectionist.
[158:57.89]Is he still mowing the fucking lawn?
[159:00.81]Because I'm doing it with a weed whacker.
[159:05.66]It would take this long.
[159:17.67]Alright.
[159:21.25]A wild animal at this edge.
[159:30.78]Alright, nice.
[159:33.86]I hope you had those screenshots from before ready.
[159:35.66]Because I'm gonna need them.
[159:40.19]Well, not yet, but in like, probably like an hour.
[159:47.89]You're mowing the lawn with a weed whacker at 3 a.m.
[159:52.58]Yeah, I'm probably on something really strong.
[159:59.52]I'm not sure what though.
[160:11.49]Watch out for the mole.
[160:24.14]I have to work in the morning.
[160:25.54]Why are you doing this?
[160:28.90]Just 20 minutes, man.
[160:31.56]I got this.
[160:38.11]Hey, do you care if I play some music?
[160:41.75]Anybody care if I play music?
[160:56.23]Play some music.
[160:58.23]What are these?
[161:00.38]I don't know.
[161:02.58]We need a clean slate, because I want to get all... I can put my own stuff in here.
[161:07.07]There we go.
[161:33.33]Oh, by the way, I forgot to say this.
[161:35.13]The, uh, the, the... One of the cocks.
[161:38.41]Maintenance, like technician people.
[161:40.85]They told me that the reason why we're having problems is because of the kids playing Call of Duty.
[161:44.66]I'm not making that up.
[161:56.51]I swear to God.
[161:57.35]It's those kids playing Call of Duty.
[162:03.90]Oh.
[162:06.59]Alright.
[162:09.17]You're one of those kids.
[162:12.48]I'm playing Ultra Call of Duty.
[162:14.38]I'm playing Call of Duty on like 30 Xboxes.
[162:20.51]Come on, give me that.
[162:35.89]Nobody even plays Black Ops anymore.
[162:40.75]It's those damn video games clogging up the toilet.
[162:48.57]Hey, okay.
[162:49.97]You in there?
[162:51.15]Yeah?
[162:51.27]What are you doing in there for so long?
[162:54.53]Nothing?
[162:55.37]Just, I have to go to the bathroom.
[162:57.97]Get off of fucking Call of Duty.
[162:59.89]Come on.
[163:02.23]We gotta go to church.
[163:14.55]mom said it's my turn to play alright but let's just let's just say that is the case right that's like let's say that's the truth and that's really what's happening what the are you supposed to do what too many video games too many internet connections too many alright
[163:45.83]Cock said it's my turn to use the internet.
[163:55.64]Don't Q our Sphere right now.
[163:59.90]Alright, I think we are clean.
[164:18.70]Time to become, like, an IRL streamer.
[164:23.84]Carrying on one of those, like, Ghostbusters internet backpacks.
[164:26.84]Oh, here's the broccoli video.
[164:44.51]Look at that, I have bigger fish to fry at this point.
[164:50.25]Okay, so we're good.
[164:51.94]Let's take care of the... All the outside is good.
[164:55.72]I'm going to do a line.
[164:56.78]I don't even know what I want to do.
[165:01.02]We're going to replace this grass, first of all.
[165:02.73]That's really important.
[165:07.33]That sounded like the weed whacker, but I can assure you it wasn't.
[165:17.44]My brother used to work at our local ISP with nodes specifically, and he told me a while ago that 99% of the time, they overload the nodes in high residential areas.
[165:25.56]Most IPS are just fu- oh yeah, no, it's ridiculous.
[165:29.39]They don't- they don't give a fuck.
[165:32.55]See, what they- they just load as many customers on as many packages as they can.
[165:37.81]Until you have, like, thousands of people on one node.
[165:42.89]And then it doesn't work as good anymore.
[165:46.84]But here's the real awful part about this, right?
[165:49.10]I'm gonna give you the real reality.
[165:50.86]Don't use that.
[165:53.55]Most people do not use the internet like this, right?
[166:00.05]Most households do not have a connection that needs to be constantly stable.
[166:09.22]Like, 6,000 up for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 hours, right?
[166:16.62]So they can get away with all this dog shit because for the most part, most people don't even know it's happening.
[166:23.99]The only reason why we know in this area that this is happening is because I'm streaming right now.
[166:31.17]So... You're not gonna be able to convince very many people like, Hey, let me go door to door.
[166:36.73]Hey, we're gonna replace that node.
[166:38.01]What are you talking about?
[166:39.53]My internet's fine.
[166:41.97]There you go.
[166:43.51]Fuck.
[166:45.04]Okay, well, have a good night.
[166:52.82]What the fuck is a node?
[166:59.10]Ah, turf.
[167:00.99]Big role.
[167:01.59]We want a big role.
[167:02.87]Let's get this laid out.
[167:06.01]Yeah, there are other companies out here.
[167:09.15]There's, like, I think, like, three different ISPs, but they all are the... They run on, like, the same infrastructure.
[167:25.15]Let's get this out here.
[167:27.41]Do I got that in the right place?
[167:29.39]I hope so.
[167:32.05]Build a Labo node.
[167:33.11]Yeah.
[167:37.19]But that's why it's almost like it's really difficult to even explain, even to a technician.
[167:45.22]This is somebody whose job it is to know the ins and outs of a network and an internet, right?
[167:50.46]And they do.
[167:50.94]They do.
[167:51.32]It's not like they don't.
[167:52.94]But
[167:54.61]Wait, YouTube?
[167:56.37]What are you talking about?
[167:58.75]What are you doing?
[168:00.33]I think it looks fine.
[168:01.11]It's like, eh.
[168:03.94]But I don't think you understand.
[168:10.24]Wait, so you're watching YouTube videos?
[168:13.06]No.
[168:14.66]No.
[168:18.81]What's YouTube?
[168:19.71]No, it's my tubes.
[168:25.75]Hey, that one was perfect.
[168:31.95]Shit, this one's not perfect.
[168:33.37]Cut it up.
[168:36.75]Get out of here.
[168:43.20]Just say I'm famous.
[168:45.00]That's not gonna do anything.
[168:52.35]Hey, well, it says here that this node is kind of overloaded.
[168:57.27]And we're really trying to put out maybe... Oh, fuck, I did... Look.
[169:00.83]Whatever.
[169:03.61]I'm famous!
[169:06.76]Okay.
[169:07.58]That's fine.
[169:09.18]We're not replacing that node.
[169:12.06]Okay, who we are?
[169:17.66]I'm just gonna keep this going.
[169:19.30]Look at this.
[169:24.84]And then there's the other option, right, of maybe, like, you need to rent, like, an office and, like, go to the office to stream.
[169:36.49]But those were expensive.
[169:40.97]Those are really expensive.
[169:45.51]How much was this?
[169:48.17]Was that, that was five grand?
[169:59.54]No, it wasn't, was it?
[170:06.24]Shit, I did this one wrong, too.
[170:07.52]Sorry.
[170:09.34]But I... Should I really have to go to get a stable connection?
[170:15.11]Should I really have to go to an office complex?
[170:24.53]That shouldn't be a thing.
[170:29.10]There's too many customers and not enough nodes to service all of them well.
[170:36.45]And, like I said previously, not very many people give a shit.
[170:43.32]As long as, you know, as long as, like, Netflix works and they can, like, you know, play their game or whatever and they can check their emails, most people just... It's not gonna be... That's not a big deal to anybody.
[171:06.48]But sadly, it is, um, it is like this kind of everywhere.
[171:11.67]I've heard stories from other streamers and other people that have, like, do this, you know, streaming and YouTube and stuff, and they're like, oh yeah, my provider sucks.
[171:19.17]Like, why do we all say that?
[171:20.53]You know, it seems like that happens very frequently.
[171:25.74]Consistent upload is important to, like, 1% of all people.
[171:28.52]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[171:30.12]Is this lined up right?
[171:34.94]Yeah, we're good.
[171:35.76]It's lined up right.
[171:36.40]It's going to take them 10 years to replace nodes.
[171:47.88]What they should be doing is replacing nodes that people are having issues with on a priority because 90% of people don't notice.
[171:53.59]Yeah, but that's where you run into like total just company like bureaucracy.
[172:00.05]They have like a blueprint of where they're going and that nothing else matters.
[172:05.81]It's just company bureaucracy.
[172:08.45]That's all it is.
[172:10.25]Hey, this node is kind of like, might need some work.
[172:12.99]Might need to be replaced with a split.
[172:15.51]No, that's not.
[172:16.91]That one's like in 2024.
[172:18.35]Invisible line?
[172:21.71]Shit.
[172:22.85]I'll get the little piece of tape and do that after.
[172:26.76]I'll do it right now.
[172:27.32]I'll do it right now.
[172:27.80]I got it.
[172:28.14]I got it.
[172:29.46]I got it.
[172:29.66]I got the line.
[172:30.12]I'll do it.
[172:32.48]No, no, no, no.
[172:33.22]It's... No, it's turf.
[172:35.98]Turf, not tape.
[172:37.26]Not turd.
[172:38.14]No, not a turd.
[172:41.80]Turf.
[172:50.59]This is so pathetic.
[173:05.97]a turd oh man anyways the worst part about it is that there are people that are on the ground whether they're technicians or supervisors that that will tell you yeah yeah this is like bad or like yeah they're not gonna replace this it's not gonna happen
[173:31.34]There's like four different companies that are talking to each other.
[173:34.58]That are like different branches of the set.
[173:36.26]It's weird.
[173:41.95]It's just really odd.
[173:42.85]Let's get a big one here.
[173:45.99]Big roll.
[173:48.81]No visible lines this time.
[173:52.41]Alright, let's get these rolled out.
[174:05.63]I thought I... It's alright.
[174:17.39]What's my end game here?
[174:20.06]To roll out grass and then put a flower bed and a swing set.
[174:31.18]Come on, don't hit the side.
[174:32.18]Don't hit the side.
[174:32.76]Don't hit the tree.
[174:33.24]Don't hit the tree.
[174:33.74]Don't hit the tree.
[174:34.32]Don't...
[174:51.22]And here's another thing that's kind of sad.
[174:54.06]Even with fiber, you can still have something called a noise floor.
[175:01.56]People can just dump junk into the network.
[175:06.81]Sometimes it doesn't matter.
[175:09.51]Even if you have like a thousand, a thousand, which is what's available when you have fiber a lot of times.
[175:18.57]This guy told me a story of how somebody had like a halogen light bulb.
[175:23.66]That was... And like fucking up the network years ago.
[175:28.32]Somebody... He also told me about somebody that... Something as simple as a modem not being screwed in tight enough... Can pump noise into the node.
[175:41.77]And it's like, what?
[175:42.47]What?
[175:47.61]It almost seems like, why is that even possible?
[175:50.31]Why would that even be a thing that could happen?
[175:56.09]Let's go right here.
[176:01.27]Electrical infederence.
[176:03.06]Yeah, no, that's real.
[176:04.26]Apparently that's real.
[176:07.12]Halogen bulbs are really bad for interference.
[176:09.24]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[176:11.58]So when you have, like, thousands and thousands and thousands of customers, and one guy...
[176:17.07]Like, has an aquarium in his living room and turns on a bulb or something and buzzes out the node.
[176:25.73]What do you do?
[176:26.55]What the hell are you supposed to do?
[176:28.24]Is that gonna hit?
[176:40.25]Better not.
[176:45.78]For fiber, any light getting into the cable can basically destroy the whole line.
[176:49.68]Yeah, it's fucking bonkers.
[177:00.72]But, you, essentially, you roll, any, any internet that you have, especially in North America, you, you're kind of just rolling the dice to if you're gonna get a connection that's not gonna have any, really, any major, uh, interference problems.
[177:17.35]And then, you know, sometimes you just get unlucky, like I have.
[177:21.86]And even in two different parts of the whole country, you have, like, interference and kind of... bad node issues.
[177:33.30]No, no, I'm not gonna do- I'm not gonna hit anything with the hammer, I promise.
[177:44.67]No!
[177:45.77]No, please!
[177:47.89]No!
[177:49.61]Cut this tree down.
[177:50.61]Just uproot it and move it over there.
[178:00.52]And we've had the conversation before.
[178:01.68]It's like, well, just move to here.
[178:04.19]Just move to here.
[178:05.41]I like it here.
[178:10.23]You know, I like... I wanted to live here.
[178:12.69]I wanted to move here.
[178:13.69]This is like where I wanted to live.
[178:25.58]Are you overlapping the turfs?
[178:26.88]Is that wasting money?
[178:29.02]Uh, yes.
[178:29.70]Probably is.
[178:30.16]Definitely.
[178:32.59]I would say 100% it is.
[178:33.21]Because Vegas is a... Is that a line?
[178:46.92]That's a visible line right here, isn't it?
[178:52.94]Uh, Vegas is a 24-hour city.
[178:55.34]So, you know, if you're up late at night or you're doing something, you can go get food, you can go do something, you can... You know, something as simple as just getting, like, something to eat at 12, 1, 2 o'clock in the morning.
[179:10.63]Is it just the texture?
[179:13.69]Vegas doesn't turn off.
[179:15.01]It's literally... everything is open 24 hours.
[179:18.17]So it's... it's great.
[179:21.17]Especially if you're a person that's like up late at night all the time.
[179:28.11]There's tons of shit to do, tons of shit to see.
[179:30.31]It's great.
[179:35.73]Well, yeah, not everything, not everything, but most things that you want are open.
[179:42.31]Turn Vegas on... Actually, I asked.
[179:45.15]I asked that.
[179:45.91]You said, turn Vegas on and off again?
[179:47.55]I asked that question to the guy this morning.
[179:49.97]I said, can you just, like, reboot the node?
[179:54.22]And he's like, I can't do that.
[179:55.92]We would turn off, like, a thousand, like, customers.
[179:58.40]No, that's not gonna happen.
[179:59.62]And I'm just like, I can't... You can't just restart it and just see if it helps?
[180:05.56]Who's gonna notice?
[180:07.28]Yeah, like, your episode of Doctor Who is gonna freeze for ten seconds.
[180:10.33]Like, who cares?
[180:10.91]Who cares?
[180:11.89]That person's not going to know.
[180:17.65]Just try it.
[180:22.19]Turn off Vegas.
[180:24.25]Just flip the switch on and off once.
[180:32.25]What was I doing?
[180:33.81]I went turf, right?
[180:36.33]Let's lay these out.
[180:38.74]This one right here.
[180:42.66]And then right here.
[180:47.04]It's almost like I need to have them overlap a little bit, just so I don't get a line.
[180:53.83]I'm gonna do this one first.
[180:54.69]Remember, I have to do it in this order.
[180:58.87]Okay, let's do that.
[180:59.79]Fucking tree.
[181:04.03]Vegas is down for scheduled maintenance.
[181:08.86]Am I?
[181:09.18]No, no, I'm not leaving Vegas, no.
[181:11.83]But fiber is, like, being built up here all over the place.
[181:17.18]There's a lot of new shit.
[181:18.42]A lot of new developments that weren't here.
[181:31.07]But why do I like Vegas?
[181:32.17]I just like the... It's mainly just the 24-hour atmosphere.
[181:38.13]Because, you know, you guys know, sometimes I'll be streaming, and sometimes the streams will go to 10, 11, 12 a.m.
[181:45.25]Pacific.
[181:46.55]And I, remember, I hadn't, like, eaten anything really all day.
[181:49.37]I hadn't really done anything all day.
[181:50.57]So that's, like, my time off stream to, like, even go get food.
[181:55.60]Go to the grocery store, you know, that's... You know, if I go to sleep at, like, 2, 3, 4 o'clock in the morning... It's just, stuff is available.
[182:08.61]Alright, that looks good.
[182:13.21]We make food at home all the time.
[182:15.25]Have you seen the plates of food that I have?
[182:17.77]Kim does great with making food.
[182:19.76]I make food, too.
[182:20.66]I've got a great recipe.
[182:23.32]Sell the trees.
[182:24.10]I don't think I can.
[182:26.10]These are just permanent fixtures.
[182:29.96]Throw your flashlight off.
[182:32.40]I've got a recipe or two.
[182:40.97]Um, okay, hold on a minute here.
[182:43.75]I'm gonna give you a countdown.
[182:48.47]It's gonna be really loud, just make sure you know.
[182:53.07]One.
[182:54.18]If you don't know, if you came to the stream later, this is louder than anything in the whole game, and I can't turn it down.
[183:01.06]So, uh, turn your volume down a lot, because it's gonna blow out your microphone.
[183:07.99]One, two, three.
[183:12.94]I can't take them down.
[183:13.62]Never mind.
[183:14.40]I did that... I might as well just water the damn thing.
[183:22.04]Alright, big roll.
[183:24.90]Let's... Right here.
[183:29.71]So, for instance, the internet has stabilized, right?
[183:34.63]We're fine.
[183:35.67]We've been fine for probably 20-30 minutes straight here.
[183:38.23]It's just so...
[183:40.35]It's like impossible to like find and fix.
[183:44.15]It's the saddest truth there is.
[183:45.81]Peek your mic.
[183:56.11]Maybe that'll fix it.
[184:00.32]Because those of you that remember, back in October, when we first moved in here, the internet didn't even work.
[184:07.06]It was all fucked up.
[184:08.38]Tons and tons of problems.
[184:09.60]It was awful.
[184:10.98]It couldn't even be used.
[184:13.39]And that is a scenario where they fixed it, and there was a big, big problem that they fixed.
[184:19.99]It's not like that anymore.
[184:21.79]Just kind of, just randomly throughout the day, just...
[184:27.54]I'm fine.
[184:28.00]I'm good.
[184:28.44]Hey, what's going on?
[184:29.00]Were you using the internet?
[184:29.88]It's me, the internet.
[184:30.70]I'm fine.
[184:43.33]That scared my cat.
[184:45.23]Oh, I'm so sorry to that little kitty.
[184:48.27]What's the cat's name?
[184:51.34]Sprinkles?
[184:59.76]George?
[185:01.24]Pretty cool cat name.
[185:09.14]Is that even the same person?
[185:17.19]How many more are these?
[185:18.23]This is not even real grass.
[185:21.53]I'm just coming to the realization here.
[185:23.52]This shit isn't even real.
[185:25.84]I'm laying out a football field.
[185:28.32]This is not even actually grass.
[185:34.35]Wait, it is?
[185:37.05]This is not astroturf?
[185:39.85]It's topsoil.
[185:49.98]They sell this shit at like the Home Depot by the roll.
[185:53.54]Is this how you make grass?
[186:06.82]Yes.
[186:07.82]I mean, yeah, only if you want it quickly.
[186:10.52]No, this is not the real thing.
[186:13.14]You plant seeds in the ground and water it and... No, this is like... This is not real grass.
[186:31.91]You're still using seeds?
[186:33.07]Yeah, that's the natural way.
[186:35.39]There's a line there.
[186:47.01]Come on.
[186:48.53]Oh, that felt so good.
[186:51.31]Did you see how good that felt?
[187:10.77]I got it, I got it.
[187:11.91]I missed it, but I got it.
[187:12.89]I'm good.
[187:17.42]But this is bothering me, though.
[187:19.00]Why can I not remove these?
[187:19.96]That's bothering me.
[187:21.50]Can I take the little roll of tape and do it?
[187:31.51]Shit, come on, really?
[187:32.63]It is a bother.
[187:42.03]I wasted it.
[187:42.63]I mean, maybe a little bit.
[187:54.21]Can you put the, maybe chips around the trees?
[187:56.94]I'll try that.
[187:57.78]How much, is this actually costing a lot of money?
[188:02.48]What, I thought, oh, no, that's not that much money.
[188:11.32]He missed.
[188:13.88]Wait, wait, wait, I'll do it this way.
[188:16.84]I didn't really miss.
[188:19.64]Didn't really hit it either, though.
[188:24.81]Stream later in the day, try to stay away from prime time.
[188:29.67]It's just, it's tough.
[188:30.85]It really is, because...
[188:34.17]I've... If you... Okay, if I... Let's say I started at, like, 7, 8, 9 o'clock Pacific time.
[188:40.26]That's so... unbearably late for so many people.
[188:46.66]And then on the same thing, if you stream at, you know, 6 o'clock in the morning, 7 o'clock in the morning Pacific, it's just screwing it up for half the other... It's difficult to try to figure out that right spot.
[189:00.65]But...
[189:02.55]I- I don't- I can't really stream at like fucking 8 o'clock in the morning.
[189:08.99]I can't.
[189:09.39]I don't have the- I don't have the energy to- to do it.
[189:12.54]I don't- I can't like get into whatever I'm- I'm fucking- I- I don't like wake up really.
[189:17.38]Takes me like two hours or so to get up.
[189:19.00]To like really wake up.
[189:24.80]And I'm- I'm at my highest energy levels at like this time right now.
[189:30.69]My whole life it's been like that, ever since I was like 16.
[189:34.67]And I can't change it no more.
[189:36.11]Oh fuck.
[189:38.07]I've tried a million times.
[189:40.51]But all through college it was- I was- peak hours for my brain is between like 1 and 5 p.m.
[189:48.36]really, is like where I'm at my highest energy.
[189:50.90]God damn it, I keep fucking this up!
[189:54.18]But I can't even tell, who cares.
[190:04.65]You were born a 16-year-old.
[190:07.43]No, I'm just saying, like, I have... Even if I get up in the morning for weeks, I'm still a slug?
[190:16.39]I think I'm one of those, like... I mean, I don't really abide by, like, energy fields and stuff.
[190:23.65]But... Is there, like, a... Can you get, like, power from the moon?
[190:32.28]Will you roll past the tree?
[190:38.96]Can't you be like a moon person and not like a sun person?
[190:48.35]Okay, why is this not working?
[190:52.75]This is gonna drive me crazy.
[190:56.51]Oh my god, why?
[190:57.63]I can't get this.
[191:09.69]Nope.
[191:18.94]I'll put flowers there.
[191:19.90]Yeah, I'll put a flower there.
[191:20.88]It'll be fun.
[191:21.34]Oh, look at this!
[191:21.95]Oh, nice.
[191:25.33]Oh, I like this.
[191:27.01]Very cool.
[191:27.85]Very excellent, I think.
[191:39.22]Yeah, I would say that's excellent.
[191:41.86]I mean, I know I'm patting myself on the back there, but I think that's kind of excellent.
[191:46.33]No, I need the big one.
[191:51.39]But!
[191:53.75]Internet.
[191:54.27]I mean, we're just having a conversation here.
[191:58.02]Apparently, having a static IP will help, apparently.
[192:04.56]I got a line here on the left.
[192:16.18]And it's weird, because I don't know if anybody knows anything about networking in here.
[192:19.78]Maybe you do.
[192:21.48]So, I need someone to explain this to me.
[192:25.16]If you do, then just chime in.
[192:27.57]This is an open forum.
[192:28.65]Chime in.
[192:30.59]The guy on the ground, like the guy in the truck, the dude that does all the networking shit, told me that having a static IP
[192:42.16]actually somehow makes your traffic a higher priority in the node.
[192:54.03]That's what I was told.
[192:54.83]It was possible that that could help.
[193:01.15]Doubt it.
[193:01.80]Static IP does nothing.
[193:06.46]But this is somebody that is... What's going on here?
[193:12.39]Is it stuck on the tree?
[193:18.59]Did I pay for this?
[193:19.29]No.
[193:20.73]I have a business package, so all support is there.
[193:34.78]It's possible to have their QoS set differently depending on address assignment.
[193:40.56]It's possible that because from what he was explaining to me is because it's static, the Cox just has RIP and it never changes and they know exactly where it is and exactly the DNS.
[193:57.61]It doesn't change at all ever.
[193:59.97]He was saying it to calm me down.
[194:04.13]I wasn't like a raving lunatic when this person came.
[194:10.17]Alright, calm down, sir!
[194:11.93]Let me tell you, just easy.
[194:21.23]I'm not like a maniac.
[194:26.39]But, so that's what the guy, and this was the person who's responsible for like maintenance and monitoring all these networks.
[194:36.53]And then the guy on the phone, like just the tech support guy, said, no, that's not true.
[194:45.12]So which one is it?
[194:45.84]It's like they have like five different scripts for different scenarios.
[194:59.55]Like which, what's the real, what, can somebody just tell me the truth?
[195:04.11]Can somebody please help me?
[195:11.80]We already, yeah, no, we've been on the business package.
[195:14.58]Damn it, I missed it.
[195:15.28]No, didn't I?
[195:15.66]No, I got it.
[195:17.96]We've been on business this whole time.
[195:26.17]But, it's almost like I don't know who to trust.
[195:28.85]It's like, I have a telltale choice.
[195:34.33]Who's the one that I'm gonna, like, go with?
[195:48.88]me we're almost I almost have a legitimate yard here dude like all these isps are so all over the place it's so I remember when I first called to like set up a business package and I said does business have priority over residential yeah
[196:13.62]Uh, okay.
[196:14.62]Cool.
[196:15.08]That's pretty cool.
[196:16.56]And then, like, three days later, I was told... No, that's not true.
[196:19.54]Who told you that?
[196:21.64]Who the fuck is running shit over there?
[196:23.69]Like, what's going on?
[196:30.37]It's just like, we have, like, 12,000 employees, and all of them are not on the same page.
[196:38.43]Ever.
[196:40.33]What the fuck?
[197:00.25]He's going out.
[197:00.73]He's getting into another episode.
[197:01.93]No, no, no.
[197:02.53]I'm fine.
[197:02.86]I'm fine.
[197:03.16]I'm good.
[197:03.64]Wait, I'm going to do this because it's cost effective.
[197:10.80]Static IP is an address for you specifically.
[197:12.62]It doesn't give you priority, but it does give them a direct point to know it's you rather than the guy down the street because when... Wait, that was a one-guy statement.
[197:20.43]Because when you connect to the internet, the ISP gives you a different IP every time you connect.
[197:23.63]Imagine having a street address that changes every time you mail a letter as opposed to a fixed number so they know it's you.
[197:33.85]Well, let's see if it does anything.
[197:34.92]Do I have to water the grass?
[197:49.88]Can I get these both?
[197:51.27]I think in one go.
[197:52.01]Let's try it.
[197:52.43]I'm going to try it.
[197:53.87]I hope I get it.
[198:02.51]Alright, let's try it again.
[198:04.09]If I don't get it this time, I swear to god I'm fucking cancelling my WoW subscription.
[198:12.44]Ah, it's cancelled.
[198:13.08]Fuck it.
[198:13.96]I don't want to play it anymore.
[198:22.99]No, don't.
[198:23.71]Don't do it.
[198:26.52]Is Classic WoW gonna be a separate subscription than regular WoW?
[198:30.49]Does anybody have any idea?
[198:31.71]Is it gonna be two different games?
[198:33.47]Or is it just gonna be two different clients?
[198:34.57]How's it gonna work?
[198:46.78]Oh, okay.
[198:47.34]That's cool.
[198:53.38]Okay, we're almost done with the yard.
[199:02.09]Uh, I'm just putting plants around these.
[199:04.49]I'm done with this shit.
[199:05.47]I ain't doing that anymore.
[199:06.69]One more here.
[199:08.11]Like, one more right here.
[199:09.57]And then we're covering this with bushes.
[199:27.68]Ah, it's always so misleading to me.
[199:30.16]Come on.
[199:33.21]I got the money, it's alright.
[199:35.17]Alright, one- last one.
[199:37.51]This is too addicting to just do this shit.
[199:41.57]That's it.
[199:48.10]Nice!
[199:48.62]Alright, let's get in there.
[199:49.42]Alright, I don't care about the front here, I'll put like a welcome mat or something.
[199:55.97]Oh, there's so much more to do.
[199:57.97]Look at how much more there is to do.
[200:01.43]There's so many more things to do.
[200:07.09]I think I could get him.
[200:10.11]Let's try this.
[200:11.11]I'm gonna try to just plant it out.
[200:22.24]Look, it can't be- it's not gonna be perfect.
[200:29.13]I wonder if that's lined up right.
[200:30.23]Who knows?
[200:30.59]Doesn't have to be perfect.
[200:40.54]Just get it right.
[200:41.20]Okay, what's the furthest one?
[200:43.57]This one.
[200:44.33]No, this one.
[200:58.34]Wait, what?
[200:58.98]Turf driveway?
[201:02.40]What do you mean, turf driveway?
[201:14.23]But look at this, like, grasses here.
[201:20.11]I have to do these, though.
[201:30.75]Yeah, I can gravel over it.
[201:31.75]It'll be fine.
[201:32.25]Hey, you're turfing where the driveway goes, mate.
[201:43.84]Just turf.
[201:44.96]Yeah, I'm gonna turf the inside.
[201:46.44]I'm gonna have a grass house.
[201:51.47]It's better than car- it's cheaper than carpet.
[202:07.44]Here come the ants.
[202:15.21]Alright, I don't... I need to do... Yeah, the driveway is this.
[202:19.34]But there needs to be... You know what?
[202:20.54]I can just... I'll fix it in post.
[202:22.10]Yeah, I'll fix it in post.
[202:25.10]Don't worry about any of this shit.
[202:27.09]Get rid of all this.
[202:28.31]I'll fix it in post.
[202:36.94]Except for this one.
[202:37.86]And maybe this one.
[202:38.54]And this.
[202:39.48]Nah, I'll fix this in post-production.
[202:41.50]Alright, how's the house look?
[202:49.33]Alright, um... Okay, here it comes.
[202:54.07]I don't want this.
[202:55.29]I don't want this wall here.
[203:00.31]Is it the garage?
[203:08.42]Here we go.
[203:08.88]You ready?
[203:12.41]Three, two, one.
[203:14.75]It's gonna be loud.
[203:15.65]Turn your volume down if you haven't already.
[203:17.85]Loud.
[203:28.90]Just keep your volume down.
[203:37.54]Keep your volume down.
[203:38.86]I'm serious.
[203:39.80]Don't turn it up.
[203:52.96]This is as serious as I'm going to be.
[204:23.46]Thankfully, the noise doesn't happen when you do it too much in succession.
[204:26.14]It does happen randomly.
[204:36.69]Jesus.
[204:37.97]Sick explosion.
[204:44.65]Crank it.
[204:45.27]Crank it.
[204:45.87]I can't hear you.
[204:46.42]Okay, you can probably hear me now.
[204:52.82]Okay, you can... Hold on, let me just take a look at what I did here.
[204:59.63]Okay.
[205:02.77]Alright.
[205:06.09]There's blood everywhere.
[205:11.42]Let's clean this up a little bit.
[205:14.10]Alright, I'm not... You can turn the volume back up a little bit.
[205:16.38]I'm not loud anymore.
[205:23.25]I got a great idea.
[205:24.09]There's some trash to remove.
[205:25.29]I just opened the door for the first time.
[205:26.69]Will you relax?
[205:27.45]A person with like 30 people in their family?
[205:30.45]You can't even fit everybody in the same picture.
[205:34.91]I've ruined my painting.
[205:36.49]Why did you do this?
[205:39.22]Just Ctrl-Z.
[205:40.90]Like everyone else was just yelling.
[205:43.64]Got some bugs over there.
[205:49.26]Don't you get like a vacuum cleaner?
[206:01.36]Sell- you can't sell the bug.
[206:05.98]Okay, that's good.
[206:06.66]Got some- is it glass?
[206:15.87]Alright, so we got a little house here.
[206:17.77]Hold on, let me think.
[206:21.47]I have an idea.
[206:22.41]What's over here?
[206:24.39]What the fuck is this?
[206:25.49]Why are there like two- why are there three garages?
[206:32.09]Alright, so these are the garages.
[206:33.21]Okay.
[206:40.96]One, two, three.
[206:51.67]Clean up these first so we can make sure we get our three-car garage in here.
[206:58.27]How's this dirt looking?
[206:59.91]Pretty dirty!
[207:04.16]Okay, so one, two, three.
[207:07.62]Wait, I can clean from back here?
[207:13.72]You actually can.
[207:15.69]But I can't go inside with this.
[207:17.19]Can I clean the window?
[207:20.15]Let's clean the window here.
[207:31.40]Clean, come on.
[207:33.12]Come on.
[207:33.56]E?
[207:34.80]Oh, it's the other side.
[207:36.10]What?
[207:45.91]Shave.
[207:46.21]Get that soap scum off.
[207:55.01]Ah.
[207:58.25]Just brush the window's teeth.
[207:59.65]Okay, good.
[208:01.38]Everything's clean in here.
[208:05.43]So it's that, then... alright.
[208:11.41]Too many doors.
[208:12.92]What is this, the kitchen?
[208:15.90]What is this?
[208:16.24]What is this, the bathroom?
[208:17.72]Then what the fuck is this?
[208:20.32]Wait, does this house have a bathroom?
[208:24.08]A bathroom into a bathroom.
[208:28.32]Why?
[208:30.17]This is a fun house.
[208:31.25]I'm so confused.
[208:32.17]I need to look at it from the outside.
[208:35.56]Alright, so... I hate this place.
[208:44.76]I... Oh, all the doors.
[208:46.48]Open it up.
[208:47.20]I hate it.
[208:52.02]Because I don't even understand what, like, the... What is this fucking layout?
[208:56.57]This opens up to a hallway.
[208:57.89]Why is this door even here?
[209:01.51]This is pointless.
[209:03.13]For what?
[209:07.59]What is this room?
[209:08.35]Is it the laundry machine?
[209:13.14]It's a... What do you mean, privacy?
[209:19.62]What, you don't... You're gonna, like, peer over here and, like, oh, what are they doing down there?
[209:23.16]They have a door to close.
[209:24.26]Look.
[209:25.70]What do you mean, privacy?
[209:27.25]Privacy for what?
[209:28.49]For the hall?
[209:29.09]Hey, hold on.
[209:30.93]Who's in there?
[209:33.91]Oh, they almost saw me.
[209:37.96]No.
[209:39.40]In fact, what's on this side?
[209:42.82]No, we gotta keep this the way it is.
[209:43.86]Alright, I gotta clean this up.
[209:47.90]Lower your volume in five seconds.
[209:50.59]Thank you.
[209:52.71]Volume.
[209:53.67]Drop it.
[209:56.51]One.
[209:57.85]Two.
[209:58.11]Okay.
[210:07.50]It's the front door.
[210:09.42]What is this?
[210:20.45]What's my need to build?
[210:26.44]Build?
[210:26.82]What the hell?
[210:28.34]Loud!
[210:32.74]It's gonna be loud.
[210:38.39]Why... I can't break this?
[210:44.66]Oh, fuck, I can't.
[210:45.62]Can I not fill it?
[210:48.50]That's annoying.
[210:49.54]I can't fill this hole.
[210:52.76]Because I can't get rid of this.
[210:57.08]No, I'm not too short.
[210:58.02]Because I can't break it.
[211:01.36]See?
[211:06.46]There has to be a door there, apparently.
[211:10.60]I can't reach it.
[211:11.14]Well, it's fine.
[211:11.76]Whatever.
[211:13.14]I'll put like a fake door here.
[211:17.37]Okay, big professional hammer.
[211:18.77]That would have been pretty cool.
[211:28.01]Alright, store.
[211:29.43]Just like a door.
[211:35.92]Whatever.
[211:36.40]I'll just put it back.
[211:40.59]It's fine.
[211:41.03]Okay.
[211:42.41]I'm not even gonna use it.
[211:43.15]This is the front door here.
[211:43.99]Clean the windows.
[211:50.18]Just make it a window.
[211:51.02]I don't think you can put windows in.
[211:53.48]How much money do I have?
[212:03.64]This house sucks.
[212:06.00]It really does.
[212:09.92]Um, volume.
[212:14.43]Give me some warning here.

[212:40.55]This is the most claustrophobic house I've ever been in.
[212:43.63]Okay, so... So this is the bedroom.

[214:37.45]The ants!
[214:38.29]I... Hold on.
[214:44.56]This looks like I'm standing on a roof.
[214:46.66]This is a roof.
[214:47.30]This is not a floor.
[214:51.36]I, like, no-clipped on top of the roof.
[214:53.48]And I'm looking down.
[215:01.46]Come on, get them all.
[215:03.50]Get over here.
[215:07.73]Come on, this thing's gonna overheat.
[215:09.01]All vacuum cleaners are like miniguns.
[215:11.59]If you use them for too long, they'll just overheat and turn off.
[215:15.90]Alright, they're gone.
[215:21.52]Oh, this is the outside again.
[215:22.55]God damn it.

[215:54.53]Something like that.
[215:55.11]Alright, that's good.
[215:55.93]Alright, now call the insurance company.
[216:13.42]Let's do all the windows.
[216:15.54]You guys wanted me to do the home alone house.
[216:17.38]Do you understand?
[216:18.20]That's like a 20-hour stream project to do that.
[216:22.96]I will do that tomorrow.
[216:34.35]Alright, looks good.
[216:40.25]Weather permitting.
[216:41.35]We'll do that tomorrow.
[216:43.61]You know, the weather is the internet here, by the way.
[216:56.00]Good one, I know.
[217:00.22]That was a scary laugh.
[217:01.86]I'm sorry.
[217:04.01]But am I really sorry?
[217:07.47]And the whole stream I'm gonna talk like this.
[217:11.84]Gonna be called Bozo's cleaning job.
[217:18.72]I'm really thinking about doing like a character.
[217:20.27]What do you think?
[217:26.31]What's all of this?
[217:40.32]Should I do a character tomorrow?
[217:44.26]I feel like people would come to the stream and not want to hang out because this guy's doing a character.
[217:48.37]Alright, I got it.
[217:53.85]Assembled.
[217:58.03]What the hell is there a light switch on?
[217:59.57]Why do they have light?
[218:00.51]Oh, no, I did this.
[218:02.19]I did this, too.
[218:02.97]They're a raptor house builder.
[218:11.35]I don't think that would go over very well.
[218:14.97]That wouldn't go over well.
[218:16.17]I'm certain of it.
[218:26.43]Alright.
[218:26.99]Any more windows to clean?
[218:28.07]This one is clean.
[218:36.87]Up top?

[219:11.98]Alright, that's it.
[219:14.46]That's it for remodeling, I think.
[219:15.80]I don't think I'm gonna have to take any more walls down.
[219:17.27]Is there blood on the wall?
[219:19.75]I got it!
[219:26.52]It actually was up there.
[219:27.78]Any more up on the roof or anything?

[243:46.21]What if I do like one here and then one here?
[243:53.58]Alright, and then... Maybe, like, another one back here?
[244:04.66]Like, two or three back here?
[244:10.52]I don't hate this.
[244:47.91]They're not that tall, guys!
[244:49.25]Relax!
[245:08.48]Somehow it's even worse.
[245:09.82]They're not- what are we talking about?
[245:11.80]It's pubes.
[245:18.88]This is fine.
[245:23.93]That's alright.
[245:24.51]And then I'm going to put like a little flower bed here.
[245:27.61]Flower bed here.
[245:29.19]Flower bed, like a couple of flowers.
[245:33.60]Why is everybody all crazy right now?
[245:47.06]You can hold your review until after.
[245:54.56]It's too close to the driveway for fancy decorations.
[245:57.01]No, not necessarily.
[246:02.67]These pubes.
[246:15.20]Oh, my God.
[246:16.02]I can't even, man.
[246:18.56]I can't even.
[246:22.32]That looks fine.
[246:23.40]It looks good.
[246:26.14]And then maybe we could do, like, just one or two little things here.
[246:29.32]One or two little things here.
[246:30.98]And then, like, maybe a little bed up this way.
[246:34.09]It's uneven.
[246:48.59]It's fine.
[246:50.21]We're gonna do some Tajites Erectica.
[247:08.31]Alright.
[247:20.18]Somebody's gave 100 bucks.
[247:26.20]Broluck gave 100 dollars.
[247:31.95]Thank you, Broluck, for the 10,000 bits.
[247:39.07]That's a shitload of money.
[247:44.52]Thank you.
[247:45.50]And you say, laughing my fucking ass off, imagine if Kim found out you were playing a clean the house video game instead of cleaning your house.

[249:41.04]I want, like, little white flowers.
[249:42.48]Here we go.
[249:47.52]Let me see how these look.
[249:52.08]Oh, we're getting somewhere.
[250:06.21]We're getting somewhere here.
[250:31.76]And then guess what goes right in the middle Can you guess That enough I gotta get rid of we're gonna do this.
[250:39.74]No, what am I doing?
[250:40.52]I don't know I don't I have no idea what I'm doing Yeah, I do.
[250:43.94]Um
[250:49.94]I need like a tree.
[250:56.08]Some taller ones.
[250:56.90]I think that's a good idea.
[251:02.02]The tall ones, but we're going to do off it.
[251:03.46]We're going to do one and the other.
[251:05.52]So watch this one.
[251:06.26]Ready?
[251:07.98]So now in the middle here.
[251:15.04]Shit.
[251:16.49]I can move them.
[251:18.31]So we're gonna go white, purple... Is that too far?
[251:40.00]Let me see how far that is.
[251:44.93]No, that's not bad.
[252:29.47]No, I'm going to keep it the way it was.
[252:32.02]The leaves don't match.
[252:33.24]I'm going to keep it the way it was.
[252:34.38]Keep it the way it was.
[252:35.60]I'm taking too much of them.
[252:48.28]Get them nice and tight.
[252:58.89]The garden looks really old.
[253:00.87]How does a garden look old?
[253:02.19]A garden looks old?!
[253:05.65]Alright, that's okay.
[253:23.94]And then I'm gonna put one more thing behind here.
[253:29.27]This is, um... What goes with purple and white?
[253:40.44]Like a light green?
[253:54.01]Yellow?
[253:56.98]What about this chrysanthemum?
[254:02.28]Ooh, that looks nice.
[254:03.90]Ooh!
[254:05.35]This looks nice.
[254:06.21]Let's see what it looks like over here.
[254:11.99]No.
[254:14.35]Maybe the front?
[254:15.07]No.
[254:16.88]It needs to be a little bit bigger.
[254:19.04]Gotta be bigger than that.
[254:27.46]Strawberry Flower Fold?
[254:41.04]Powerade?
[254:41.74]This is not big enough.
[254:43.70]Wait, I'm gonna do this.
[254:51.94]Give me my plants.
[254:58.97]Maybe we should put the yellow?
[255:00.01]No, chrysanthemum full.
[255:02.15]How big is that?
[255:08.68]This is big, right?
[255:10.30]No, fuck, this is tiny.
[255:14.36]Well, I have to put this over there.
[255:16.38]Gardening's too hard.
[255:28.60]Guarding's too hard.
[255:29.56]I think it's just that guarding's too hard.
[255:33.59]That's just too time consuming.
[255:34.93]Why would anybody do this?
[255:57.99]Normal people wouldn't over-cross a parking pathway.
[256:06.74]But what if they might?
[256:08.58]Because they wanted to look decent on their pull-up.
[256:23.23]Rows belong on farms, not flowers.
[256:28.89]It's a look... Okay.
[256:30.37]Look, the house looks like shit.
[256:31.65]That's why I'm having problems here.
[256:35.65]The house looks terrible.
[256:37.03]I need to paint the outside of the house.
[256:38.23]Alright, what the hell is this thing called again?
[256:45.93]I could do carrots, pumpkins... It's the purple one.
[256:53.33]Where is it?
[256:55.92]What was it called?
[257:01.19]It's not this one right here, is it?
[257:06.97]Is it Anemo?
[257:07.87]Is it this one?
[257:13.99]I think it is this one.
[257:14.74]Yeah, it is.
[257:19.48]Okay, now I got the base here.
[257:29.71]No, good.
[257:30.87]No.
[257:31.09]Okay.
[257:43.84]Then we just do double it up.
[257:51.53]I think I'm done.
[257:53.77]I'm done after that.
[257:54.89]I'm gonna go fucking hit the wall with a hammer some more.
[258:09.12]Where the hell is it?
[258:14.77]Can I sort by color?
[258:20.31]I guess not.
[258:23.71]Where is it?

[259:00.06]What was that sound?
[259:12.68]Okay, almost done.
[259:13.92]I don't need it.
[259:19.37]Oh, look at that.
[259:20.05]Looks nice.
[259:21.43]That's cute.
[259:26.45]This is overloaded here.
[259:29.49]Too overloaded in the front.
[259:31.31]You were right.
[259:32.35]You guys were absolutely correct on that.
[259:39.80]And we're gonna do... Let's do...
[259:43.45]Yeah, too overloaded.
[259:44.31]That's better.
[259:44.71]Okay, now... What the hell was I doing over here?
[259:50.77]Making rocks?
[259:52.45]This... There's so much room.
[259:55.35]Um... Okay, recreation.
[259:59.53]I'm just gonna make a carnival back here.
[260:25.90]Why is it so tiny?
[260:33.40]Who is going to use this?
[260:35.25]How tall are these kids?
[260:40.97]You gotta have gnome goalies.
[260:42.81]Okay.
[260:43.59]Yeah, I will.
[260:44.15]I will.
[260:44.47]Hold on.

[260:51.50]What?
[260:52.26]I actually can make an actual...
[260:56.39]Alright, well, hold on.
[260:56.99]Where's this gonna go?
[261:00.03]Right here is good.
[261:06.52]Recreation.
[261:08.78]Grill projector.
[261:12.10]Rooster rider.
[261:14.46]Outdoor cinema screen.
[261:16.38]Tire swing.
[261:17.28]A pizza oven!
[261:21.81]Why is there a pizza oven?
[261:24.68]A whole gym?
[261:25.94]Ugh.
[261:27.12]I gotta have a gym.
[261:45.42]Alright, kids.
[261:46.16]We're replacing... Here.
[261:48.38]Get rid of this stuff.
[261:49.62]You don't want this.
[261:51.43]Dad's upgrading you.
[261:54.74]Yeah, you gotta have the yellow slide, that's very important.
[262:07.07]Blue slide, that's a lot of bullshit.
[262:08.71]I'm not gonna have a blue slide in my... swing set, you know what I mean?
[262:16.21]We're gonna go default.
[262:18.43]Lightning yellow.
[262:33.92]I want to be able to see when you spin around.
[262:35.34]Let's make an obstacle course.
[262:40.94]You gotta, like, slide underneath the kids that are all spinning around really fast.
[262:46.42]Is that too dangerous?
[262:47.42]Ah, move back over here.
[262:48.54]Fine.
[262:48.82]Alright, we got a little play area.
[262:58.50]Put some trees in here.
[263:02.97]I need a pizza oven back here too.
[263:11.42]No, I don't, not yet.
[263:12.80]Fire pit.
[263:15.64]Can I put a pizza oven in the house?
[263:20.71]Here's the kitchen.
[263:21.53]I want a pizza oven.
[263:27.69]Why can I not have a pizza oven in my kitchen?
[263:37.01]Um, really?
[263:41.30]Pizza ovens don't go inside.
[263:42.84]Yes, they do.
[263:43.28]I'm not gonna have somebody tell me I can't have a pizza oven in my house.
[263:46.82]I'm gonna take this down loud, incoming.
[264:07.28]There comes a loud noise.
[264:08.16]I apologize.
[264:15.96]No, I can't close this.
[264:19.81]Do I have to put doors here?
[264:22.91]Whatever.
[264:34.11]No, he's not gonna... People... Slide down.
[264:38.57]No, that would not be good.
[264:40.02]Okay.
[264:43.70]Uh, where can I put this?
[264:49.74]I gotta make, like, a little pa- Okay, there's gonna be a back patio.
[264:54.66]Right here.
[264:57.36]Pizza oven will come at a later date.
[265:05.88]I'm gonna be a rich dick.
[265:08.82]I'm gonna be the guy with the... You know, if you're the guy with the pizza oven... On the back patio.
[265:15.49]I mean... You're kind of a dick.
[265:23.56]I... I mean, you're a dick.
[265:32.18]I definitely want one of these.
[265:35.07]But can't you just see going over somebody's house that has a pizza oven on their porch?
[265:40.75]You're probably gonna be like... Is this guy a dick?
[265:44.71]He might be.
[265:45.57]I feel like that's like the potential that you might be a dick.
[265:57.24]Pizza ovens are dope.
[265:59.00]I know, I want one!
[266:01.18]I definitely want one on my back porch, but I feel like somebody would think I was a dick.
[266:10.84]I feel like that's like a... Can I do this?
[266:18.73]Can I have the kid's house be inside the house?
[266:22.07]You open the door and you go into the kid's house?
[266:40.41]I guess I can have it in here.
[266:41.40]This could be like a little playroom.
[266:42.66]No, I don't think everything's about the kids.
[266:44.66]I'm a dick.
[266:45.91]I have like three pizza ovens on my back porch.
[267:08.61]I would gladly be a dick if it meant I had a pizza oven.
[267:12.36]I know, I'm just fucking around, don't worry.
[267:23.46]I really am just making- I am a dick.
[267:26.24]Because... I'm just trying to have the funnest house.
[267:32.07]I got pizza oven, I got an entire county fair in the backyard.
[267:39.45]I should charge people to come over to the house.
[267:44.33]Recreation, anything else?
[267:52.04]Well, now I know I'm a dick.
[267:53.18]Are you serious?
[267:59.47]Who puts this outside?
[268:00.85]Why would you put this outside?
[268:11.00]Well, I need to put some gravel down here.
[268:12.24]Um, sand?
[268:22.71]Hey, what?
[268:50.77]Stop doing that.
[268:52.56]Every time I go in the house, it takes it off.
[268:54.74]Okay.
[269:24.11]I don't want this tree here.
[269:25.71]That's the problem.
[269:27.22]There's a tree in the middle.
[269:41.01]No one puts gravel on their porch.
[269:44.21]I'm just trying to block it out to see.
[269:45.69]Well, how do- Oh, fuck.
[269:48.97]Right, I don't- I can do this.
[269:53.50]Shit.
[269:55.37]I didn't realize it.
[269:56.97]Alright, sports surface.
[270:17.56]Am I?
[270:25.73]No, I actually have to place them one by one.
[270:28.54]No, I don't.
[270:29.08]Do I really?
[270:29.54]Is there a bigger one?
[270:35.62]Yeah, there is.
[270:36.32]Okay.
[270:36.56]I don't think I'd say that would be horrible.
[270:56.68]Okay.
[270:57.52]I gotta fix this.
[270:58.40]I'm... Fuck.
[271:13.13]What?
[271:14.29]Oh, crap.
[271:17.63]God damn it.
[271:19.19]I need the logs.
[271:20.37]I need the long ones.
[271:29.67]How are you supposed to do this?
[271:30.63]Oh, whatever.
[271:35.82]It's fine.
[271:36.24]This is going to be such a pain in the ass.
[271:50.15]Just make a whole new house.
[271:56.73]No, I can't make an entirely new house.
[272:13.32]Does it really have to be a tree here that I can't remove?
[272:15.40]I can chop the tree.
[272:22.67]How do I do that?
[272:43.94]This house is giving me... I'm trying with a weed whacker.
[272:49.08]Alright.
[272:49.60]Wait, wait, wait.
[272:50.26]This is... The whole thing is messing me up.
[272:56.07]What?
[272:57.97]I need walls.
[272:58.91]I need to paint this house biscuit gravy.
[273:04.89]Okay.
[273:07.09]The outside of the wall is going to be biscuit.
[273:09.44]Let's see.
[273:09.78]I want to make sure I like it, because it looks terrible.
[273:21.99]It looks even worse.
[273:23.19]No, it's gotta be... Hmm.
[273:31.70]What is all this stuff?
[273:38.72]Walls.
[273:40.53]Wall panels.
[273:45.71]Wooden house.
[273:47.71]Brick.
[273:48.05]I'm not doing brick.
[273:49.05]Brick.
[273:51.82]Creamy caramel?
[273:53.44]No.
[273:57.03]This one, maybe?
[274:04.41]Smooth pastel pink.
[274:07.98]I'm not doing 3D tile.
[274:14.08]Eeyoo?
[274:14.40]This is Eeyoo?
[274:24.41]Should I do the waves?
[274:29.03]It's gonna... I mean, it's probably gonna be... There's a brick.
[274:32.79]Let's see how bad this looks.
[274:39.06]Let's just see how bad it looks.
[274:40.42]Hold on.
[274:59.93]That's not... Isn't that a hundred bucks?
[275:06.69]No good?
[275:08.19]No good?
[275:10.05]We'll do the light brick.
[275:12.46]Uh... Walrus Boy gave a hundred dollars.
[275:16.60]Thanks for the 10,000 bits, Walrus Boy.
[275:21.06]Thank you.
[275:23.99]That's a lot of fucking money.
[275:26.81]A hundred dollars...
[275:29.18]And they say, I was a sub for a while, but had to cancel my debit card due to fraud charges.
[275:34.08]And so I was not able to resub again until now.
[275:36.84]Please take this and consider it back pay for all the times I wanted to show my support by being subscribed, but I wasn't able to.
[275:44.55]And for the literal years of laughs you've given me, thank you.
[275:49.19]I'm sorry to hear about the card problems, but thank you so much.
[275:52.07]It means a lot.
[275:54.85]I really appreciate that.
[275:55.67]That's a lot of money to ever give anybody.
[276:00.23]And I am shocked and floored that you'd want to give it to me.
[276:04.45]So, thank you.
[276:07.00]Hopefully your card situation is done and looks good.
[276:11.24]Kind of like the outside of this house.
[276:12.46]Looks pretty good.
[276:18.47]But thank you.
[276:22.27]How do I panel up here?
[276:39.68]How do I get that?
[276:43.50]Nice brick oven house.
[276:51.48]My house just is a pizza oven.
[277:02.58]It's fine.
[277:03.88]It's fine.
[277:13.30]Sooner or later, we'll have a good house.
[277:23.42]So, earlier in the stream, you probably noticed I was very high energy.
[277:31.49]I'm very low energy right now, for the last, like, probably hour.
[277:34.85]I hit the wall.
[277:36.91]So, if you don't know, I didn't sleep very much last night.
[277:41.09]I only slept for about three hours.
[277:42.41]I was up at, like, seven o'clock in the morning.
[277:45.57]And I hit my second wind and turned the stream on, and was like a psycho for three hours.
[277:50.57]And now I'm just like... Ah.
[278:03.33]I don't hate the outside here.
[278:05.67]On the bright side, the internet has stabilized.
[278:07.67]Yeah, it's been pretty good.
[278:10.37]Take what we can get, right?
[278:19.54]Go to bed?
[278:20.04]No, not yet.
[278:22.48]I think I can finish this house.
[278:26.27]Alright, question!
[278:28.12]Um... Should I do the Home Alone house tomorrow?
[278:30.30]I ain't doing any... Maybe I'll do my... Isn't there like a horror movie house?
[278:33.36]I feel like if we're gonna do a House Flipper, I may as well dedicate like a couple of streams to it.
[278:39.63]That's right.
[278:40.41]Beep.
[278:41.25]Scream at me.
[278:48.59]This actually is just a pizza.
[278:51.90]I should just block this off and have these be three different pizza ovens.
[278:58.08]is just a giant pizza oven.
[279:01.36]And I live in it over here.
[279:12.26]That's just stupid enough for me to want to do it.
[279:14.38]I'm not making the PT house.
[279:21.87]I'll fucking throw up.
[279:29.18]Is there enough?
[279:30.42]Is there two more?
[279:32.37]Come on.
[279:36.23]Hey, look at that.
[279:45.63]Oh, are you shitting me right now, guys?
[279:48.01]Can I put like wood chips in here and have like a wood oven?
[279:53.37]There's a wood stove?
[280:13.46]Oh, come on.
[280:14.06]I can't... Just make... Yeah, I can make, like, a pizza parlor.
[280:19.43]That's a good idea.
[280:23.71]So what can I do for this?
[280:25.21]First, let me close this up.
[280:26.17]I need three...
[280:38.99]I don't have enough... Can I seriously not build more than one at a time?
[280:41.57]I thought I could.
[280:42.07]Isn't it like Q or something?
[280:47.03]Or like W-E-R?
[280:48.51]What is it?
[280:49.07]T?
[280:49.59]Q?
[280:55.82]No, there we go.
[280:57.80]I thought I already did this.
[280:58.74]There we go.
[281:05.66]Okay, there it is.
[281:17.40]Alright, this one's gonna be coal.
[281:20.34]For, like, extra crispy pizzas.
[281:25.68]This is gonna be wood fire, coal fire, and then, um, I don't know, microwave?
[281:32.73]How else do half of the restaurants make their pizzas?
[281:35.13]And this is the parlor.
[281:36.13]The garden doesn't even matter.
[281:37.33]This is like the, okay, uh, this is where you come in.
[281:44.49]Brick oven?
[281:45.83]Yeah, the whole thing's a pizza oven.
[281:47.39]And then the coal, if I can do coal, let's just block this out in my brain here.
[281:54.43]Yeah, you just, like, fucking frisbee the pizza into there.
[281:56.93]You can have, like, ten of them at a time.
[281:58.17]Let's see.
[282:02.89]Alright, I got ceramic charcoal.
[282:08.26]This could be charcoal.
[282:14.19]Need shelves and racks for the pizza.
[282:17.31]Yeah.
[282:24.68]Ceramic.
[282:27.64]This looks like charcoal.
[282:34.48]No.
[282:36.90]It's gotta be just like brown or black or something.
[282:40.10]That looks alright.
[282:45.09]Let's try this.
[282:59.86]That looks terrible.
[283:04.24]This is shit.
[283:10.78]This is a shit idea.
[283:26.97]Okay.
[283:37.22]Back.
[283:38.06]Floor.
[283:41.74]This looks like wood.
[283:43.16]Wood fire.
[283:49.56]Rug fired oven?
[284:04.41]Okay, looks good.
[284:14.17]And then this needs to be, like, black.
[284:25.11]Just need... Not blue.
[284:29.17]Just needs to be black.
[284:30.83]Are there no black carpets?
[284:45.50]A pizza rug?
[284:47.60]Yeah but that's for the main hallway.
[284:49.96]Can I just paint the ground black?
[284:52.46]Imagine that.
[284:55.27]Imagine painting your ground black.
[285:00.27]Doing some weird shit in there.
[285:06.13]I don't think I can paint the ground.
[285:29.28]Charcoal could be the sides.
[285:31.34]The apartment has black floors.
[285:41.79]That's interesting.
[285:43.13]I mean, I guess maybe like entryways?
[285:56.66]Oh, that's fine.
[285:57.44]We need, like, heat lamps, too.
[286:00.36]And we can air it out.
[286:02.58]Alright, so let me see.
[286:12.87]So the wooden paneling has to go in here.
[286:14.31]Maybe we can get actual wood paneling.
[286:25.74]Wall panels.
[286:28.59]Wood.
[286:29.71]Here we go.
[286:30.65]Yeah, that's perfect.
[286:32.48]At least the same thing?
[286:33.14]No.
[286:33.54]Do they even have pizzas?
[286:58.94]I wish I could do this faster.
[287:08.72]It's a Pizza Hut Taco Bell combo.
[287:13.31]Why did you say that?
[287:16.23]You just said the magic... Like, 14 words.
[287:22.21]Pizza Hut and Taco Bell combo 9.
[287:24.90]Fuck.
[287:28.45]Wait.
[287:28.85]Pizza Hut and Taco Bell combo.
[287:31.05]Those are syllables.
[287:32.07]Those aren't words.
[287:33.97]You can tell I'm fucking tired.
[287:35.47]I'm fucking tired.
[287:42.84]I counted syllables as if they were words.
[287:45.60]But you said... You said Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
[287:56.27]You said the combination of things that make me hungry.
[288:06.59]I've entered sleepy mode.
[288:07.77]Yeah, I have.
[288:09.01]I am.
[288:10.70]I might have to call it soon, unfortunately.
[288:12.80]I'm just glad I was able to stream for at least a while.
[288:15.86]And this is relaxing and fun.
[288:19.06]This is like helping me go to bed.
[288:26.60]How do people do 24 hour streams?
[288:28.67]I can barely stay awake for 24 hours.
[288:44.49]Wooden box room.
[288:46.85]What am I doing?
[288:47.75]What am I- I'm making a pizza house?
[288:50.84]What is it?
[288:51.50]What are we doing?
[288:52.58]What are we doing right now?
[288:55.10]Making three giant pizza ovens?
[289:00.35]Why?
[289:01.65]Why am I doing this?
[289:06.19]I feel like if I walked at this room, it'd be like... I wanna... Is it weird that I wanna sprint around in a circle in this room?
[289:16.92]I wanna fucking run around... Oh no, this is basketball court now.
[289:26.38]I wanna just fu- it looks like so waxed and slippery and shiny, I wanna just start here and SPRINT and stop and turn and sprint.
[289:34.05]So it goes I so badly wanna do that.
[289:47.79]Whatever gets you off, well, yeah, that's fine.
[289:54.65]Have you guys ever seen, like, a freshly waxed basketball court?
[289:58.92]Oh, it's something to behold.
[290:00.90]It's just like when the, uh... So, when the gazebo goes over the ice.
[290:07.86]And it's brand new ice, freshly shaved down.
[290:11.24]Freshly, like, coated.
[290:12.18]Yeah, the Zamboni, whatever.
[290:22.31]I can't say Zamboni.
[290:26.68]That's a gazebo.
[290:31.91]So anytime the Zamboni goes across...
[290:35.49]Same scenario.
[290:36.43]I want to get a running start.
[290:38.81]Like wet, slippery, just zambonied ice.
[290:43.07]Start outside the rink.
[290:45.20]And run as fast as I... Okay, so let's say that's the rink starts right there, right?
[290:49.68]I want to run as fast as I humanly possibly can.
[290:52.56]Jump, dive, face first, slide across the whole rink.
[291:11.52]Did you just make like a Golden Knights diss?
[291:19.44]Why?
[291:22.18]The Golden Knights did a fantastic fucking job.
[291:32.19]I feel like I could play like goalie for a minute.
[291:34.75]I think I could like stop a slap shot.
[291:36.71]I really do.
[291:39.75]If I ever got like the balls...
[291:43.24]Imagine if I, like, contacted, like, the Golden Knights organization.
[291:49.56]And I just had a star player, like, try to score a goal on me.
[291:59.73]I feel like I might die.
[292:04.53]I don't know why I'm picturing this weird, like, Adam Sandler movie scenario.
[292:09.15]Where, like, I get the puck right in the visor, right in between the eyes.
[292:23.57]I'm not doing all those up there.
[292:26.49]I can't.
[292:30.34]It's so small.
[292:34.18]Do them, do them, do them!
[292:35.43]Alright, alright, alright, I'm doing them, I'm doing them.
[292:36.83]I'm doing them, I'm doing them!
[292:37.87]I'm doing them!
[292:51.72]Finish painting the other room?
[292:52.82]I will.
[292:53.22]Don't worry, I will.
[292:57.47]Don't worry.
[292:58.01]I'm gonna come back tomorrow.
[292:59.35]I'm gonna be rested.
[293:00.83]We're gonna have static IP.
[293:02.87]And there's gonna be no drop frames.
[293:05.34]And what other, like, fucking Wizard of Oz bullshit made-up scenarios am I gonna come up with here that are not gonna be real?
[293:11.26]I wonder.
[293:21.33]I can't panel the ceiling.
[293:22.99]I'm gonna leave that there.
[293:24.05]No, I'm not.
[293:24.47]I can't handle that.
[293:32.28]Karate!
[293:33.70]I get that.
[293:38.72]Looks good.
[293:39.50]It's a nice wooden room.
[293:42.62]Ah, fuck.
[293:43.28]No, it's not done.
[293:51.27]This room is just bizarrely... I just feel like I need to... I feel like I come in here and like sit in the corner and need to be quiet in here.
[294:01.89]This is like a weird... I don't know why this reminds me of... I don't know.
[294:04.99]I feel like I need to be like quiet in this room and I'm being like punished.
[294:08.53]It's like the wooden room.
[294:14.43]You just have to go in here and be quiet in there.
[294:21.39]There's a window, though, so... Oh, boy.
[294:39.41]There's still, like, grass.
[294:47.53]Grass coming up.
[294:49.69]And, ugh.
[294:52.81]God damn it.
[294:55.09]I can't make the ceiling wood.
[295:00.14]I can't make the ceiling wood.
[295:02.10]It doesn't work.
[295:03.04]Okay, what was this one gonna be?
[295:05.36]Alright, charcoal.
[295:11.39]Go to sleep?
[295:12.01]I'm good, I'm good.
[295:12.91]Don't worry.
[295:14.35]I'm gonna wrap it up here in a few minutes.
[295:16.65]I'm going for about five hours.
[295:18.59]I'm very tired.
[295:20.45]But I had a lot of fun.
[295:23.05]It's fun to come back.
[295:23.85]Why did I just- what the fuck am I doing?
[295:26.60]I'm typing in Reddit!
[295:45.59]It's like, uh, ah, Reddit, why is my- this is my browser!
[295:57.19]Oh, wow, that'd be great if I had this much fucking money in, like, Firefox.
[296:00.93]Alright, I'm going.
[296:07.05]That's it.
[296:07.71]That's time.
[296:13.40]That's so fucking ridiculous.
[296:15.58]I'm really not even that tired.
[296:18.48]Yeah, it's time.
[296:19.30]That's time to call it.
[296:24.44]Because I was looking, I was like, wait, how come my, why is it not popping up?
[296:29.41]Well, I guess I'll just go to the front page.
[296:34.15]Let me see this clip.
[296:35.27]What a joke.
[296:40.14]I'm going for about five hours.
[296:41.12]I'm very tired.
[296:44.36]Rapper?
[296:46.68]Wrapper.
[296:47.92]W-R-A-P-P-E-R is what I first typed.
[296:50.88]Over about five hours.
[296:52.84]I'm very tired.
[296:55.24]Wrapper.
[296:55.92]What do you mean wrapper?
[297:00.34]What?
[297:00.68]Wrapper and then...
[297:15.23]Oh, I'm talking about wrapping it up.
[297:19.23]Alright, goodnight.
[297:19.91]I'm getting out of here.
[297:31.78]That's so, like, embarrassing, but whatever.
[297:34.16]I feel like I'm on, like, anesthesia and I'm waking up and saying weird stuff.
[297:37.80]Are you guys, like, recording me on your phone?
[297:40.66]Are you gonna post me to fucking Facebook?
[297:48.04]Anywho.
[297:49.22]Yeah, that's five hours.
[297:50.40]I didn't have much sleep.
[297:52.36]I'm just glad I was able to stream.
[297:54.90]20,000 dropped frames in five hours.
[297:57.61]We were stable for a while, though.
[298:05.07]Thank you again, everybody, for putting up with this.
[298:10.81]It can be very frustrating.
[298:11.87]It's very frustrating for me.
[298:14.31]But it's something that I'm actively trying to fix.
[298:17.65]Hopefully it's not too much of a pain in the ass for you to watch.
[298:22.35]But I do appreciate it.
[298:23.37]I really do.
[298:30.87]Much love to you.
[298:32.93]We don't have... I don't think we have very many... Yeah, we don't have very many bits or anything.
[298:36.85]So we can do that.
[298:37.55]It'll be fine.
[298:39.81]We'll do some more House Flipper tomorrow.
[298:45.20]Starting at the normal time, hopefully we have a good string of like five hours of stability?
[298:50.97]Six, seven hours maybe?
[298:52.07]We'll see.
[298:55.82]And then, let's take a look at the calendar.
[298:57.54]Like, just... If I can even stream.
[299:00.83]I hate that I have to do this again.
[299:03.19]But... So today's Thursday.
[299:05.43]Friday we'll do House Flipper.
[299:06.51]And because I have not been streaming for the last... You know, three days in a row here.
[299:14.12]I'll try just to go four days in a row.
[299:17.56]You know what I mean?
[299:21.90]I've...
[299:23.72]We've been off for three days, if I can.
[299:26.39]If it's possible, if the internet will let me.
[299:29.47]So Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[299:32.71]And then... One, two... When is my colonoscopy?
[299:36.15]Because I'm going to have to take a couple days off for that.
[299:39.65]So then we'll do like one, two, three.
[299:43.19]I'll take like two or three days off here.
[299:46.09]We'll figure it out.
[299:47.15]We'll figure it out.
[299:48.33]But I'm going to have to take a day or two off for the colonoscopy, so...
[299:53.96]The colonoscopy.
[299:57.38]But, anywho, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
[300:00.06]We will give it a try.
[300:02.21]Thank you, Robaz, again, for the raid and the host and everything.
[300:07.99]Came in here a couple hours ago while we were in the middle of the internet bullshit, so... Sorry you had to see that.
[300:15.17]But, let us transition out of here.
[300:19.46]See you all tomorrow.
[300:22.44]We should have the static IP tomorrow, which maybe it'll help.
[300:26.14]I don't know.
[300:26.42]I'm willing to try anything.
[300:28.94]But... A thank you.
[300:31.75]A special thank you.
[300:37.13]To... Let's go back into the bits.
[300:39.63]We had a... Mermaid.
[300:43.09]Mermaid's slam for the five dolls.
[300:45.24]Feels bad to make a joke about your failed goals.
[300:50.64]My failed goals?
[300:51.50]What?
[300:53.33]What'd I do?
[300:58.67]What were the goals?
[301:00.31]What were my goals?
[301:04.21]Thank you for the $5, though.
[301:07.81]Thank you also to Kayler Mimamoto for the $3.
[301:12.53]You should move to Canada and come have a good hockey team and good internet.
[301:18.41]Oh, and it'll suit you really well since most of our pizza places have walk-in ovens.
[301:25.02]I'm really tired.
[301:25.94]Have I just been talking about pizza since the beginning of the stream?
[301:36.13]Was I?
[301:36.49]I don't even remember.
[301:37.99]Okay.
[301:42.09]Am I weird?
[301:42.83]Am I being weird?
[301:44.25]Am I a weirdo?
[301:47.49]If you have to ask that question, you probably already have the answer.
[301:54.59]Thanks for the $3, though.
[301:59.87]Thank you, Ambix, for the $2.50.
[302:02.21]This is a whole thing in Jerma, I think.
[302:07.70]Hello, my damon.
[302:12.48]This is your episode von JermaCraft.
[302:15.96]The series in your Minecraft.
[302:19.58]This was episode... Oh, it's just... Okay, I see what's going on.
[302:26.42]It's just the first minute of... Alright, I get it.
[302:30.63]Thank you for the Jerma translated JermaCraft.
[302:38.03]Thank you for the 250 as well.
[302:40.31]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the 250.
[302:41.65]He lives.
[302:43.41]I didn't think you'd be streaming tonight.
[302:44.69]Thanks for the surprise.
[302:46.51]Neither did I. But thankfully we could get something in and have some fun.
[302:51.38]Because I had fun.
[302:53.28]It was fun learning how to cut grass with a weed whacker.
[302:58.32]Talked a little bit of shit, had a little bit of fun.
[302:59.80]Hopefully you enjoyed it.
[303:02.34]Thank you for the $250.
[303:05.77]Thank you, Halo Soft Boy, for the $260.
[303:08.03]I don't think that's a straw man.
[303:10.69]I think that's a real man.
[303:13.11]Something I said earlier, and then they're laughing about it.
[303:20.39]Wrapper.
[303:22.67]Reddit.
[303:23.33]Oh my god.
[303:25.37]Autopilot, man.
[303:26.63]Just on autopilot.
[303:32.97]Dr. Fudge, thanks for the $15.
[303:36.71]Jerma, I can't hear the hammer.
[303:38.43]Turn it up.
[303:41.95]I did at some point there.
[303:43.78]I really actually did.
[303:44.56]Am I ever going to get new BRB end stream overlays?
[303:48.72]Yes.
[303:49.68]Blordow is currently working on them right now.
[303:55.11]in a week or two, depending on how long it takes them to make it.
[303:59.35]We're going to have 10 to 12 new songs for background when we do the wind down and a wind down animated screen.
[304:09.98]Something to play in the background that's not the stream over.
[304:13.72]So there'll be a large playlist of songs that he has created.
[304:19.83]for the wind down specifically.
[304:21.65]So there'll be two portions of the end of the stream.
[304:25.15]This one, which will not have this stream over.
[304:28.98]It'll be more thought out, you know.
[304:34.44]And then we'll transition to this one when it's actually time to leave.
[304:39.52]We have some ideas.
[304:40.56]He's got a couple of great ideas for stuff that happens in the background and the scene.
[304:45.10]And we've been talking back and forth.
[304:47.48]It's probably going to be pretty great.
[304:56.07]Don't get rid of the screen songs.
[304:57.39]No, no, no.
[304:58.37]They're just going to be added to a circulation.
[305:02.60]So the intro and outro songs will stay the same, but if I want to, I can pump in one of the new ones in random places.
[305:09.78]I can have two or three lined up.
[305:11.30]I can change it once in a while.
[305:14.47]It's just adding, not subtracting, so don't worry.
[305:22.15]So don't worry.
[305:22.63]It should be fine.
[305:24.50]Blordow makes amazing music.
[305:28.42]He's one of the best when it comes to making... He makes really great, just chill, relaxing music.
[305:37.45]He's got great talent when it comes to making... Like, listen to this.
[305:41.77]This is just beautiful.
[305:45.55]He's got great ambient talent.
[305:51.41]So essentially what we talked about is, I was like, I want a lot more of this.
[305:56.88]So we're going to get more of these low-key ambient tracks that he is very much known for.
[306:13.48]But thank you to Dr. Fudge for the $15.
[306:15.06]Really appreciate that.
[306:19.51]Thank you, uh, $3 from Leroy.
[306:22.02]Thank you, Leroy.
[306:22.58]Hey, Jerma, good luck with the colonoscopy.
[306:25.00]I'm 26 and had to have one of those last year for my ongoing stomach problems.
[306:29.76]I really appreciate that you talk openly and without shame about this kind of stuff.
[306:33.86]Makes me feel like less of a weird, gross goblin.
[306:37.27]Anyway, I wish you the best.
[306:38.31]Hope you get a chance to check out some Firesign Theater stuff in the future.
[306:44.08]Yeah, I've... I've been pretty much an open book when it comes to illnesses and stuff.
[306:52.06]I feel like it's... It's just... I have this shit.
[306:57.54]I have this problem.
[306:58.86]I have these things that I have to do.
[307:00.00]I've had it for pretty much over a decade now.
[307:03.02]It's like a pretend it doesn't exist.
[307:08.63]I just want to make sure that everything is good.
[307:13.36]because I have not been really evaluated
[307:18.41]since like 2014, 2013, maybe a little bit later, maybe 2015, when I had my last real evaluation at a sigmoidoscopy, which is not the same as a colonoscopy.
[307:31.52]It's the same thing, but they don't go as far into your intestinal tract.
[307:36.70]They just kind of go up into like the lower half of your colon.
[307:40.79]They don't go all the way in.
[307:43.05]So yes, you can say they need to go deeper.
[307:46.53]They do.
[307:46.95]Yes, they do.
[307:48.87]And I've had kind of some issues recently over the last six months.
[307:54.76]I don't know if they're related to the colitis and all these other IBD issues.
[308:00.08]But I don't know.
[308:00.58]It was a good idea.
[308:02.90]He said, let's just do it.
[308:04.54]Just do the whole thing and let's be certain, right?
[308:08.45]So, that's happening next week.
[308:14.71]The prep is the worst.
[308:16.27]Yeah, that's why I'm going to have to take...
[308:19.01]I'm probably gonna have to take like two or three days off.
[308:22.65]Because you can't eat.
[308:23.45]A full 24 hours before the procedure, you cannot eat food.
[308:29.09]So I won't really be... I won't have any energy, I'll be tired, I'll be kind of irritable probably.
[308:35.34]So I don't think I can stream a day before, the day of, and maybe even the day after, depending on how the drugs... I did say I wasn't going to do any drugs.
[308:45.97]Going straight up no sedation, but... Depending on the practice, you actually might, from my understanding, is they might not offer that.
[308:56.85]I just don't like the idea of going under.
[308:59.36]I really don't.
[309:00.32]It freaks me out.
[309:04.77]You should be okay the day after.
[309:06.94]Yeah, we'll see.
[309:08.28]I'm definitely going to do at least the day before and the day of, obviously.
[309:11.02]I won't be able to do anything the day of.
[309:14.22]But... Anesthesia just freaks me out.
[309:18.93]I've had it done once.
[309:21.81]I just don't like it.
[309:22.93]I just don't like the idea.
[309:24.27]I don't like the whole process.
[309:28.35]So I already talked to them.
[309:30.11]I said I either don't want sedation or I want it light enough, like very light.
[309:37.55]So hopefully I can, you know, they actually adhere to that.
[309:52.12]Yeah, you know, it's a conscious sedation, right?
[309:58.86]I've had tons of operations and I just enjoy it now.
[310:02.06]Yeah.
[310:03.02]It's, I guess, something you just kind of would get used to.
[310:13.54]But I think I'm just kind of a weirdo.
[310:16.85]And I always like to have this weird scenario in my brain where it's like... Okay, like, here we go.
[310:25.54]Alright, it's time for you to go under.
[310:27.78]Alright, here it comes.
[310:28.90]Oh, are you going to feel a little pinch in your arm?
[310:31.66]Okay.
[310:32.62]And now you're going down.
[310:34.32]Here we go.
[310:35.14]Alright, we'll see you soon.
[310:36.24]Have a nice sleep.
[310:40.19]There's a fire in the building!
[310:42.27]Fire!
[310:42.81]And I'm just like, there's a fire!
[310:44.43]I can't do anything!
[310:48.98]You know what I mean?
[310:49.84]Like...
[310:53.50]Like, the fire alarm goes off and you're just like... Was somebody gonna pick you up?
[311:04.12]You shouldn't overthink things like that.
[311:06.53]I know, but you don't have... The same person that told you that I'm scared of, like, them finding DNA on my bubblegum.
[311:27.69]Oh, maybe some of you guys weren't here earlier.
[311:35.71]The doctor screamed in my face one time right before I went under.
[311:39.05]What the fuck?
[311:45.95]What?
[311:46.61]No!
[311:47.31]That's so bad!
[311:48.89]That's not rea- Did that really happen?
[311:56.47]The last time I was under conscious sedation, I was... I got my wisdom teeth out.
[312:02.60]And it was really fucked up.
[312:05.66]It was fucking weird, man.
[312:08.72]I was lying in the chair, and I remember just, like, hearing the same sound go, and... He was playing music on a radio, and it was just... I could hear a loop of the last thing that was said.
[312:21.71]It was just like... It was just... I could hear it over and over again.
[312:30.08]And then I said out loud, do people say funny things on this?
[312:34.62]And the dentist said, stop talking.
[312:37.85]And then I started laughing.
[312:38.95]And then that's all I remember.
[312:50.70]I had my wisdom teeth.
[312:52.58]I hate that.
[312:53.46]I hate it.
[312:56.37]I know some people are really into the whole... Oh, man, yeah, you get all psychadelic, man, like the walls are breathing!
[313:04.45]No, no, no, no, I want the walls to stay firm and not collapse, and I want them to not breathe at all!
[313:14.96]Dude, I love just sinking down, like, I love that.
[313:17.66]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[313:25.20]Are we getting kicked off?
[313:26.32]No, we're good.
[313:28.94]The walls got him.
[313:34.32]I need to be very, very close to reality.
[313:38.18]Otherwise, I feel like I would lose my mind.
[313:49.36]There's a difference between hallucinogenics and sedation.
[313:51.83]I know, I know.
[313:52.63]But I'm just saying.
[313:54.41]I don't... I would probably hate it.
[313:57.07]Just because when I get put on a drug... I, like, don't want to be on it.
[314:04.42]So I'm sitting there while I hear, like, the same sound play ten times.
[314:08.64]And, like, the walls start to move around and I start to put my head back and I'm just like...
[314:16.85]I want to go out of here.
[314:18.97]I want to go home.
[314:21.07]That's why I'm like, I don't want sedation.
[314:22.39]And they're like, you're fucking stupid.
[314:34.14]But we'll see.
[314:43.43]Don't play yourself like that.
[314:44.53]Sedation isn't a bad thing.
[314:45.63]No, I know, I know.
[314:51.83]Just get sedated to deal with the sedation.
[314:58.35]I'm not nervous about going under, but I'm nervous about the idea of being in that loopy state.
[315:02.13]All the videos out there of people getting their wisdom teeth removed, I'm worried what I might say.
[315:06.29]Yeah, I don't know, man.
[315:11.56]Like, I might wake up and start saying passwords.
[315:14.56]You know?
[315:14.94]Like, I don't fucking know.
[315:22.08]I would be the worst person to be on a truth serum.
[315:24.08]I would just say- I would just tell you everything.
[315:37.33]They'll just say Reddit.
[315:44.73]Reddit.
[315:45.93]Reddit.
[315:46.89]I wanna go to Reddit.
[315:53.62]And I feel like if you sit around and you... Here's the thing.
[315:57.30]If I'm sitting there and I'm on those drugs and I'm going to tell myself over and over again, don't say anything fucking stupid.
[316:03.04]Don't say anything crazy.
[316:04.26]Just be normal.
[316:05.29]You can do it.
[316:05.83]You can do this.
[316:06.51]You can be normal.
[316:07.21]I feel like the outside perspective is like, I'm not saying anything normal and I'm being insane.
[316:14.73]I'm not going to start streaming.
[316:16.37]No.
[316:17.23]I'm going to be under close supervision.
[316:30.69]No cameras are allowed.
[316:31.93]I ain't having anybody film me.
[316:36.79]After I'm coming up.
[316:39.23]Not gonna happen.
[316:39.73]They're gonna get all my passwords.
[316:51.81]That would be gold.
[316:59.44]Record.
[317:04.77]But let's keep going.
[317:06.59]I've said my piece.
[317:08.11]But yes, it is happening next week.
[317:12.93]Prime opportunity to bump my stocks.
[317:15.63]Thank you to Big Buddy.
[317:17.88]Thank you, Big Buddy, for the 10 bucks.
[317:21.10]Jerma flips houses on stream.
[317:22.82]jermaOld.
[317:25.18]Flipping houses is kind of like a boomer activity, isn't it?
[317:28.60]No, there are some, like, millennials and zoomers that are into that.
[317:32.92]They're just not doing it on TV on four different networks.
[317:41.21]Thank you, Zach the Sloth, for the $5.
[317:42.81]Hey, Jerm, I'm sitting outside watching you stream and enjoying the warm weather.
[317:48.67]When you first made that loud sound with the hammer, I shit my pants and shouted my phone on the pavement.
[317:54.01]But don't worry, it wasn't your stream's fault.
[317:55.93]It was my ass' fault.
[317:58.27]Oh.
[318:01.20]I mean, it was.
[318:07.32]Thank you to Stix Renegade for the $2.55.
[318:09.10]Did somebody say 40 bumper stickers?
[318:16.42]Yeah, this is, yeah, just everywhere.
[318:24.41]Bumper stickers, they can just think about bumper stickers, right?
[318:28.60]Bumper stickers, you know, I got one, two, three, four.
[318:33.80]At some point, they kind of just look like car zits.
[318:43.94]I have a hundred?
[318:44.82]A hundred!
[318:52.25]Wait, do you mow words in the grass?
[319:04.03]What is it?
[319:04.43]What's all is that like a is it these pokémon?
[319:11.34]This is a business pokémon characters Poking poking mon
[319:35.42]You got, hold on, you got your shit like blurred out, right?
[319:39.08]Making sure you have like this shit blurred out.
[319:51.16]Never pronounce it that way, but Pokémon.
[319:53.62]Pokémon.
[319:57.90]Oh, this is their car.
[320:03.90]I'm going to see what I recognize on here.
[320:11.47]I don't think I recognize any... Is that a Five Nights at Freddy's character?
[320:18.80]Is that the fox from Five Nights at Freddy's on the top right?
[320:33.18]The sands is on there.
[320:44.73]What's the one all the way to the bottom right?
[320:47.95]Is it like a lightning bolt?
[321:08.58]You can honestly... You can tell a lot about somebody who has car stickers.
[321:15.90]How do you get those off?
[321:18.24]If you peel those off, does paint come with it?
[321:27.41]You don't.
[321:30.61]What if you want to sell that car?
[321:37.96]I hope they really like Five Nights at Freddy's.
[321:46.04]What are you selling that car for?
[321:49.82]Oh, it's a Freddy!
[321:50.66]I love Five Nights at Freddy's!
[321:56.61]Freddy!
[322:01.57]Freddy?
[322:03.05]Fred!
[322:06.31]Woo!
[322:10.46]Somebody will know what that is.
[322:11.99]Ah, but that's a lot of stickers.
[322:19.19]That's a lot.
[322:28.48]I want to see your lawn.
[322:31.20]But thank you for the... Thank you for the...
[322:41.09]Illinois hog call, there you go.
[322:43.25]Nice job.
[322:45.27]I'd key your car, to be honest!
[322:47.39]Hey, settle down!
[322:51.46]Hey, settle down!
[322:54.56]Jesus!
[323:05.28]Uh, sticks renegade, thank you.
[323:06.84]Thank you, Sergil Butt, for the 250.
[323:09.90]Jeremiah, I've been listening to your stream for about three hours while I was smithing some tools.
[323:15.66]Just wanted to let you know that there is a part of a blacksmithing anvil called a hardy hole.
[323:21.18]Thought you should know that.
[323:24.76]Is there?
[323:27.25]Look at the people we got in this chat.
[323:30.21]Magic the Gathering artist, a blacksmith.
[323:43.68]Every Five Nights at Freddy's character on a bumper sticker on somebody's bumper.
[323:55.04]Some interesting people here.
[323:58.41]And then the rest of Doctors and Scientists.
[323:59.87]Yeah, we've already gone over that.
[324:03.67]But thank you, Sergil Butt.
[324:06.07]Hopefully he made something cool.
[324:09.25]One true roadie.
[324:10.56]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[324:13.28]Love you, Jeremy.
[324:13.82]Finally subbed since I'm financially stable.
[324:16.16]Thank you for nearly a decade of great content.
[324:20.48]Thank you for nearly a decade of watching.
[324:24.81]Because without you watching this stuff, I wouldn't be here.
[324:35.53]So thank you.
[324:37.28]And especially thank you for the $10.
[324:38.24]Really appreciate that.
[324:42.52]They never said they watched for that long.
[324:44.32]What?
[324:46.44]They said thank you for nearly a decade of content.
[324:51.17]What do you mean they didn't tell me how long?
[324:53.83]They said a decade.
[324:55.21]That's ten years.
[324:58.15]What?
[325:01.71]Thank you, TheYellowist, for the $3.50.
[325:02.82]Hey, hey, I'll have to catch the VOD for this one, but I can already tell it's going to be great.
[325:07.22]Here, take some cash just for being you.
[325:11.11]I'll gladly take it.
[325:12.93]Thank you so much for giving it to me.
[325:15.15]Thanks for the $3.50.
[325:16.77]Hope you like the VOD.
[325:18.59]I was pretty tired.
[325:21.11]Silverflame, thanks for the $2.50.
[325:22.21]Hey, Germo, surveys gave me bits again.
[325:24.87]Anyways, I met a girl and we hit it off.
[325:27.01]Our conversation went to streamers.
[325:29.71]She made a comment about lady streamers.
[325:32.59]I mentioned how you sometimes don't wear clothes and stream in a bathrobe.
[325:37.73]Anyway, moral of the story is that she was actually interested in me rambling about you, which is cool.
[325:42.13]I think she's a keeper.
[325:42.95]Well, that's all.
[325:43.71]Smooches, enjoy the money, you silly willy.
[325:47.79]Well, what you told her about me is a factually correct statement.
[325:55.05]I do stream without clothes on.
[325:58.57]I don't have a camera on, but I do sit here
[326:02.81]as just me as the day I was born.
[326:05.59]No, I don't.
[326:06.25]That's a lie.
[326:06.87]I don't sit here naked.
[326:09.25]How would I do that?
[326:10.79]There's other people that like live in this house.
[326:14.85]That's kind of weird.
[326:15.99]No, I don't do that.
[326:23.75]Can you fucking imagine how much of a weird motherfucker you have to be to... When I broadcast, I just broadcast naked.
[326:38.96]No, I always... I'm pretty much shirtless every moment of the day.
[326:42.38]Unless I'm driving around somewhere.
[326:44.52]If I go somewhere.
[326:50.36]Hey, Ato, what was that?
[326:52.17]He's like, hey, we gotta go.
[326:55.85]Do it as a joke.
[326:59.67]No.
[327:01.79]But, glad to hear that you're... Might be having a potential... Getting a new... Friendship into maybe a relationship?
[327:11.50]I don't know, whatever you're doing here.
[327:16.44]Wish you both luck.
[327:17.22]Hopefully you guys... Talk about more street.
[327:20.70]Talk about me somewhere, you know?
[327:22.54]I'm a topic of conversation, talk about me.
[327:31.50]But thank you.
[327:34.36]Uh, thank you to... Uh, Razlik Corgan for the $5.
[327:40.18]Hey Jerma, I'm thinking about jumping into the world of streaming.
[327:44.27]Even if I get just 10 viewers, I think it'll be a blast.
[327:47.03]Any advice you're willing to share?
[327:51.66]You're already on the right track.
[327:56.11]Do it because you want to do it, because you think it'll be fun.
[328:00.11]You already got the right mindset, so... Give it a try.
[328:08.98]You got step one.
[328:17.84]Take your... No.
[328:23.86]The thing is, people ask me advice for streaming.
[328:27.75]But... I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[328:37.22]Like, at all!
[328:37.98]I don't even know how to turn the stream on sometimes!
[328:51.20]We know.
[328:54.68]No, but honestly, it... There's no real... There's no real blanket advice that's possible to give.
[329:05.33]Just because of the nature of the platform.
[329:07.35]It's a bunch... Think about what the platform is, right?
[329:09.55]twitch.tv or any streaming platform.
[329:11.45]Even YouTube, you can add this together.
[329:14.10]You have a bunch of people who are all streaming, right?
[329:18.00]Right now, there's a bunch of... Oh, can you hear me?
[329:20.46]Or did we lose... I think we're good.
[329:27.00]What I was saying is you have a bunch of people that are doing this sort of thing at the same time.
[329:32.86]And trying to maneuver your way around and find some kind of audience or some people that would be fun to hang around with or some people that you want to stream to.
[329:44.23]You kind of have to make your own brand, right?
[329:46.89]Make your own way that you know how.
[329:52.46]Because there are a lot of ways to do it.
[329:55.74]You know, are you really good at something like a video game?
[329:58.16]Are you like top 10 percentile in a particular game?
[330:02.15]That's worth watching.
[330:04.11]Can you do something really fast?
[330:05.83]That's worth watching.
[330:07.37]Can you make like jokes?
[330:08.47]Do people think that you're funny?
[330:10.14]That's worth watching, right?
[330:11.76]There's a lot of avenues that you can go down to start a stream.
[330:24.69]So what might be right for you or what might be right for me might not be the same for anybody else.
[330:34.30]Because I really don't have a way to... Here's what you need to do.
[330:37.70]Step one, step two, step three.
[330:39.14]Because I don't know.
[330:40.22]I really don't know.
[330:43.04]Just try to do something and try to do something that you're good at and see what happens.
[330:58.84]Did the internet kill the stream?
[331:00.26]No, we were teetering around for a little bit.
[331:03.28]It was still okay.
[331:12.46]People shouldn't go into something with the brand in mind?
[331:14.61]No, no.
[331:15.35]What I mean by that is... You just kind of have to do whatever you want to do.
[331:24.95]Most of the people that started doing this just did it because they felt like doing it one day.
[331:30.61]And it was just, I want to make a video.
[331:33.93]I'm just going to make it.
[331:35.15]And I'm going to put it up.
[331:36.89]Did anybody watch my first five videos?
[331:39.41]No.
[331:41.85]My first 10 videos?
[331:43.03]Maybe a few.
[331:44.85]I just kept doing it because I was just having a great time.
[331:48.35]I was just having a lot of fun making a video.
[331:53.43]And in the initial stages, it was almost to see if I could even do it in the first place.
[332:10.17]we all watched JermaCraft yeah but that was that was like 50 videos in I knew what I was doing at that point I had everything figured out but I wish you the best of luck I I wish there was more advice I could give but I don't really have any if I'm completely honest
[332:41.35]Dermacraft was the pinnacle.
[332:44.33]I disagree, but that's okay.
[332:54.03]You've seen me in the servers.
[332:56.57]What's the best video you think you ever made?
[332:58.47]I mean, that's kind of... That's very skewed.
[333:01.39]I mean, Jerma Rumble live action was just... That's probably the best video, and it's like the last video I ever made.
[333:12.10]Maybe Castle Grifinstead just put a lot of time into them?
[333:14.62]Thought they were a lot of fun to make?
[333:24.72]I have a lot of videos that I remember very, very fondly.
[333:34.82]What video embarrasses you to think about?
[333:38.00]Every Modern Warfare 3 video.
[333:40.96]I actually uploaded a video that was a 14 and 7 kill confirmed gameplay.
[333:45.97]And I thought that was a good... I thought that was a... At the time, that was okay to upload for me.
[333:51.53]It was like, yeah, this is good.
[333:52.95]I'll upload that.
[333:56.77]14 and 7 kill confirmed.
[333:58.05]And I thought it was... Yeah.
[334:00.69]But this is... Listen, this is back before... I'm going to go off on a little thing here.
[334:04.39]This is back before eSports was really took off.
[334:11.13]and people were really good and all the best players were coming out and being noticed and good gameplay, really good gameplay was something that was sought after at that point.
[334:21.36]This is like 2011, 2012.
[334:28.24]I used to make tip videos on how to play the scout.
[334:45.02]Star defended your iPhone game video saying that you were a genuine casual.
[334:50.71]Yeah, playing iPhone games in bed is not the same of... You know what I mean.
[335:00.00]But yeah, being really good at a video game really started to take off, like, just about five years ago.
[335:07.84]All the esports teams started to really form and started to make teams, started to compete.
[335:13.22]Money, real big money started to get involved in competitions.
[335:21.26]That was like 2012, 2013 is when that really started.
[335:34.53]But it's an interesting space we're in.
[335:44.58]It was way earlier than that.
[335:48.00]Yeah, but... I mean, I don't know, because think about, like, even, like, YouTube.
[335:55.86]2010?
[335:55.88]2011?
[335:57.43]That was, like, the Call of Duty YouTubers were just starting to really be popular, and... eSports hadn't really taken off that much.
[336:08.11]Online entertainment for video games hadn't really... It was just starting to happen.
[336:18.84]Back in like 2008, 2007, 2008, 2009, you would get your channel deleted if you uploaded video game footage.
[336:28.50]Like straight up, your channel is terminated.
[336:31.98]Back in like 2000, before like 2010.
[336:33.01]Somewhere in like the 2005, 2006, 2007, when they really started to introduce all that stuff.
[336:51.73]Yeah, I think there were specific cases of people uploading GTA 4 footage and it just being instantly removed.
[337:08.11]You couldn't even upload videos longer than 10 minutes.
[337:10.47]Yeah, it was crazy.
[337:19.22]2010 is the year that online video game media really was starting to take off.
[337:35.04]Yeah, you used to have to get approved for 15-minute videos.
[337:43.70]Video responses?
[337:45.14]Oh, yeah.
[337:47.40]Yeah.
[337:50.58]You might think that that's a long time ago.
[337:51.98]That's not that long ago.
[337:53.28]That really... I mean, like, 2010, 2011?
[337:56.92]That's less than 10 years ago.
[337:58.06]I mean, it's not like it was, like, 20 years ago or something.
[338:06.74]It was really, like, 8-ish plus years ago, almost.
[338:12.59]You had so much hair back then.
[338:13.71]I actually had a lot less hair, because I had it short.
[338:16.63]I cut my hair really short.
[338:20.73]10 years is still a good bit.
[338:21.61]Yeah, no, it is.
[338:25.26]But in this last 10 years, we've seen such a monumental surge in attention to, like, the gaming communities, the gaming world.
[338:36.20]I remember when Smite had that $2.6 million tournament, and I remember being like, holy fuck, man, that's insanity.
[338:46.81]That's crazy.
[338:55.34]There was a big Dota one four or five years ago.
[338:57.92]What was the one?
[338:58.28]It was like 10 million bucks or something like that?
[339:00.56]10?
[339:01.74]8 million?
[339:03.58]That's when it was really like, holy shit!
[339:06.74]You mean I can make millions of dollars doing this?
[339:13.23]When was the first international?
[339:17.93]That'll probably give you a good indicator.
[339:24.20]I remember reading that article of the first International.
[339:27.72]Yeah, 2011, 2010.
[339:31.96]The International has a prize pool of $20 million.
[339:33.80]Yeah, that's... That's an insane amount of money.
[339:43.42]Yeah, it's... We're 18... It was not in 1800.
[339:45.54]Remember the Gaming at the Olympics video?
[339:53.24]You called it.
[339:55.26]Yeah, people told me I was wrong.
[339:59.28]Jeremy, in quotes, always write 985.
[340:01.78]I'm gonna... I'm gonna shave that into the back of my head.
[340:19.34]You really did have such a galaxy brain prediction, though.
[340:27.32]Yeah, too bad back in like 2010, 2011, 2012, I was doing galaxy brain gaming community predictions and not like buying Bitcoin.
[340:39.59]Too bad I didn't have that kind of galaxy brain intuition, huh?
[340:54.00]It always goes back to crypto.
[340:58.18]Alright, we'll move on, though.
[341:00.28]Good talk, though.
[341:01.16]Good talk.
[341:01.72]Very good talk.
[341:05.52]Thank you to Lobotomized Teddy Bear for the $2.75.
[341:11.19]Jerma, I'm an intern at the Smithsonian.
[341:13.15]One of my jobs is web maintenance.
[341:14.91]If you could not possibly crash our site, that would be great.
[341:18.79]Also doing IRL gardening streams.
[341:25.18]It'd be more embarrassing than me trying to do it in the digital world.
[341:32.41]I don't think I would be able to do that.
[341:35.99]I would rather do the get slapshotted by a professional hockey player in goalie equipment than do a gardening stream.
[341:48.04]But thank you for the $2.75.
[341:52.32]Uh, we also had 250 from Shalashakshka.
[341:57.26]I fuck up your name every time, and I'm really sorry.
[341:59.50]I have my hardest finals tomorrow.
[342:00.84]Could you wish me luck?
[342:01.46]Good luck.
[342:05.99]Hopefully you do well in your finals.
[342:10.37]Hopefully you get some good grades.
[342:12.45]And then you relax.
[342:15.27]Because you earned it.
[342:16.83]You know, you've earned it.
[342:18.82]Good luck.
[342:21.55]Uh, Vellemi gave $50 while we were in the middle of that conversation a little while ago.
[342:26.40]Thank you, Vellemi.
[342:28.74]5,000 bits, 50 bucks.
[342:31.64]Thank you for the large, large amount of money.
[342:34.92]Don't forget to chug a few Mountain Dew throwbacks before the operation.
[342:39.79]Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[342:41.03]I have, like, streamer amnesia.
[342:52.34]No, I can't do it.
[342:52.94]I think I can only have jello and chicken broth for a day and a half.
[343:00.18]God, that's gonna suck.
[343:08.86]Yeah, you can't have anything red.
[343:12.92]I'm one of those people where I lose my mind if I can't eat.
[343:15.64]I am going to eat
[343:19.50]I don't know, maybe I should just eat... Should I just drink like a banana peanut butter smoothie the day before that?
[343:26.02]Like a 4,000 calorie banana sludge peanut butter smoothie like the day before I can't eat anything?
[343:35.55]Should I do that?
[343:36.67]Maybe that'll like keep me full.
[343:45.47]Think of the shi-
[343:49.20]Jeremy, did you eat anything a day or two ago?
[343:51.42]Uh, why?
[343:54.10]Just, did you?
[343:55.88]Yeah, I had a 4,000 calorie two full jar of peanut butter smoothie.
[344:01.01]Oh, well, that's why I can't see anything.
[344:04.37]It's still going through.
[344:05.29]They'll find it in there.
[344:18.84]How do you make a smoothie out of peanut butter?
[344:20.20]It's a great ingredient.
[344:22.26]Just slop it in there.
[344:23.95]Just go... Pull it out and... Into the blender.
[344:33.14]Thank you for the $50 over, Lemmy.
[344:35.20]Much appreciated.
[344:39.42]Silent Serenity thanks for the 250.
[344:41.06]The last time I had anesthesia, I asked my orthodontist if he drove the Lambo outside.
[344:46.32]And then I started rambling about the ass man Seinfeld episode.
[344:51.57]You know what I'm gonna do?
[344:52.73]I swear to God.
[344:53.89]Because you always like pull out something fucking that you just did or you just saw.
[344:59.03]It's like, whatever's like right in your memory at that moment, I'm gonna watch the day before 24 hours straight of just nature documentaries.
[345:10.72]So, did you know that the giraffe can reach heights of 29 feet tall?
[345:17.32]I'm not gonna say anything embarrassing, I'll have knowledge.
[345:23.28]I think that's a good idea.
[345:32.92]The turtle sex is gonna come up.
[345:34.52]Oh, fuck.
[345:35.84]Don't say- No, that's in here now.
[345:36.96]That's in my brain now.
[345:37.66]That's in here now.
[345:39.97]Me saying that and being embarrassed about it is now locked up here in a door.
[345:45.39]What have you done?
[345:46.61]What have you done?
[345:47.29]No.
[345:49.91]I saw turtles having sex.
[345:51.97]Oh, this is bad.
[345:53.86]I'm going to just watch.
[345:54.84]I'm going to get something else in there.
[345:56.64]I'll watch, like, all of, like, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[346:01.12]The whole thing.
[346:02.24]I'll watch every movie.
[346:03.54]All the whole cartooners.
[346:04.49]I'm going to get the whole thing in there.
[346:06.25]So I'll just say, like, you know, Raphael in episode 2,000.
[346:09.71]Mm-mm.
[346:18.78]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[346:20.80]I'm talking about, why did I, I'm tired.
[346:23.56]I'm talking about, your mind just combined them.
[346:31.34]Oh god.
[346:32.88]This is bad.
[346:34.72]We talk, we talk so much shit, we say so much dumb, fucked up stuff sometimes, just out of nowhere.
[346:40.66]One of them's gonna pop up.
[346:46.04]Ugh.
[346:53.10]Let's get the credits rolling.
[346:54.94]I'm not going to take auto out.
[346:55.84]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[346:57.32]I still have a couple more bits, but let's run the credits.
[347:02.28]Thank you, everybody, for subscribing and supporting this broken-ass stream the last week straight.
[347:14.34]I really appreciate it.
[347:19.91]Hopefully we have a cleaner internet tomorrow.
[347:27.35]Dropped only 2% today.
[347:32.65]That's okay.
[347:34.11]That's okay.
[347:34.64]That's like doable.
[347:36.64]That's streamable.
[347:37.52]That's alright.
[347:41.64]Double that up and it would be a problem.
[347:45.78]Otto is, yeah, he's just sneezing.
[347:47.00]Otto sneezes when he gets excited.
[347:49.32]He just starts going.
[347:52.88]He's just staring at me.
[347:53.74]Yes, I'm talking about you.
[347:55.60]Yes.
[347:56.02]Are you going to sneeze?
[347:57.64]Are you going to sneeze?
[347:59.30]Are you going to sneeze?
[348:00.80]Are you going to sneeze?
[348:02.95]No, I'm not going to sneeze anymore.
[348:04.73]Okay.
[348:08.15]Hey, he did.
[348:08.79]He did.
[348:09.63]Haha.
[348:10.29]I knew you were going to sneeze.
[348:11.63]He's going to do it again.
[348:12.17]What are you doing?
[348:18.59]Show him?
[348:19.45]Hey, I'll just show him for a second.
[348:20.72]Otto!
[348:23.24]Otto.
[348:24.96]Can I show him?
[348:25.74]Hey.
[348:25.84]Why are you looking so fu- Why are you having so much fun?
[348:30.08]Why are you having so much fun?
[348:31.00]Why are you having so much fun?
[348:37.95]Let me just turn the camera on.
[348:41.13]And I will point you in his general direction.
[348:46.57]Why is this dog having so much fun?
[348:51.33]Hey.
[349:00.18]Hey.
[349:07.68]Hey.
[349:13.97]Hey.
[349:16.43]Hey, what are you doing?
[349:19.64]Were you napping in here?
[349:21.74]Yes.
[349:24.94]Look at that tail, ready?
[349:28.06]Hey, what are you doing?
[349:38.74]He's my special boy.
[349:41.07]But thank you everybody for your subscriptions.
[349:42.79]I'll see you tomorrow.
[349:43.63]Hopefully we have at least able to start and stream tomorrow.
[349:47.76]If not, then I'm going to try whenever I can.
[349:50.34]I'm going to try to do this as... Fit them wherever it's possible.
[349:53.32]However it's possible.
[349:55.81]Keep an eye on the sus.
[349:57.37]If something changes last minute, it'll be updated tomorrow.
[349:59.99]A lot of subs tonight.
[350:02.65]Thank you guys.
[350:05.04]And let's finish up the bits, we only have a couple more.
[350:07.06]Uh, Vilemi gave $5 again, on top of the $50.
[350:10.68]Uh, no message on here, but thank you for the $55, Vilemi.
[350:15.27]It's a lot of money.
[350:16.77]Thank you.
[350:18.11]And then finally, uh, Fugue, or Fweg, thanks for the $10 a few minutes ago.
[350:27.05]Thanks for the $10. $10.
[350:28.84]They say, hey Jermo, I recently used you as one of my influences for my senior legacy project at school.
[350:34.23]I put the blood in the box clip in my video presentation and no one laughed.
[350:47.37]Well, to think that that video's funny, you have to under- I guess you have to, like, understand the, like, loot box craze that streamers and YouTubers were really pushing and showing, and it was kind of a craze for a year or two.
[351:02.30]You kind of had to be there, right?
[351:12.31]Time to get a new identity.
[351:18.87]You're just gonna be the blood box guy, oh no!
[351:23.51]Don't worry, like, show him, like, a cool video.
[351:26.07]Is there a video where I've ever, like, was cool?
[351:31.07]Have I made a video where I've ever been cool?
[351:33.44]Where he was like, holy shit, that was fucking- that was cool, man, what he said.
[351:39.66]Lifting the weights, yeah, oh, absolutely.
[351:41.22]Show them the- no, why would you do that?
[351:43.04]That'd be weird.
[351:44.06]Hey, look at this guy lifting weights on camera.
[351:46.64]Why would you show people that?
[351:51.58]That'd be weird to show for just out of context.
[351:54.45]It's cool though.
[351:58.89]I've actually thought about this a lot before.
[352:00.23]I don't believe there's any video of Jerma's I could show to a friend.
[352:04.29]Me either.
[352:06.23]So we can both agree on that.
[352:19.91]It's cool.
[352:22.43]Alright, guys.
[352:23.71]I will try again tomorrow.
[352:24.85]We'll see you soon.
[352:26.69]Thank you for watching.
[352:29.25]Hope you had a good time.
[352:30.25]I did.
[352:32.69]And keep an eye on the sus.
[352:34.37]I will give you an update tomorrow morning, tomorrow afternoon again like I did today.
[352:37.71]I'm gonna get some sleep.
[352:39.23]I'm gonna get some food.
[352:40.01]Hopefully it's a pepperoni pizza.
[352:42.67]It will be a pepperoni pizza because that's probably what I'm gonna order.
[352:45.79]Have a great night.
[352:47.35]Take care.
[352:48.33]See you real soon.
[352:49.79]Bye-bye.
[353:17.66]Thank you.
