[00:08.70]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.30]Jerma here with the midnight launch of Mists of Pandaria!
[00:15.20]I'm actually here with MLC_St3alth Live here.
[00:17.87]Um, say hello.
[00:20.56]Hello, everyone.
[00:21.66]We're making pandas.
[00:22.78]We're making pandas.
[00:24.08]The Mists of Pandaria just literally launched like five seconds ago.
[00:28.64]It is three o'clock in the morning here right now, so it's very late for me, but still I want to make a panda.
[00:34.80]Gonna be playing as a monk, the new class in World of Warcraft in this expansion.
[00:39.30]Pandarian the race, and let's go, let's make them.
[00:42.68]Alright, I'm gonna be typical panda color.
[00:46.04]Dude, I might be, like, Tabby Cat Panda.
[00:48.88]Like, look at it.
[00:52.06]I look like a cat.
[00:52.96]This looks like my cat that's in my house right now.
[00:56.00]That's so funny.
[00:58.97]That's what I'm doing.
[01:01.45]Yeah.
[01:02.71]Alright, is it gonna be a male?
[01:04.91]Face.
[01:06.43]Alright, he's gotta have a really stupid face.
[01:09.31]Female panda.
[01:10.57]Looks kinda cute.
[01:11.85]Not gonna lie.
[01:13.45]Does it?
[01:14.52]No.
[01:19.32]Oh, MLC_St3alth.
[01:21.88]Loves those female pandas.
[01:25.36]Alright, let's go back to male.
[01:26.84]Oh, did I lose it?
[01:27.42]No, I didn't.
[01:27.76]Okay.
[01:28.95]Oh my god!
[01:30.69]Are there a lot of people here?
[01:35.61]Oh, hey, hey, look at everybody.
[01:37.77]I wonder if you guys just installed the game.
[01:39.56]I just see a thousand people climbing these steps.
[01:43.98]Dude, this is... Wow.
[01:47.32]There's so many people here.
[01:51.46]We all look the same, like ridiculous.
[01:55.03]Wait, what do I got for my first move?
[01:56.95]Jab?
[01:58.31]Look at all these people just practicing.
[02:01.27]I can't even click on the quest giver.
[02:05.95]Where is he?
[02:08.12]Oh, man.
[02:08.48]Oh, this guy broke the... I wanna hit that thing.
[02:12.68]Oh, wow.
[02:13.70]Oh, everyone's just training.
[02:15.26]What is this?
[02:15.64]A quickening palm?
[02:19.08]Oh, man.
[02:19.92]Oh, my gosh.
[02:22.19]Look how fake this looks.
[02:24.29]We're all wearing the same armor and it looks ridiculous.
[02:27.33]Hey, did you see my Winnie the Pooh character yet?
[02:31.17]What the hell was that?
[02:32.39]What the hell was that?
[02:34.19]What the hell was that over there?
[02:36.40]What just came out of the water?
[02:37.50]Something enormous just came out of the water over here.
[02:40.68]I don't... Hold on.
[02:42.32]Okay.
[02:44.63]Did you see that?
[02:45.77]No.
[02:46.17]Where are you?
[02:46.75]Can I jump down there?
[02:47.53]I need to add you.
[02:49.45]Okay, Jerma.
[02:50.99]I'll give you $100 if you can find somebody who's not Panda Monk.
[03:03.62]Hold on.
[03:04.44]Hold on.
[03:05.38]Oh, I found a priest.
[03:07.18]I found a priest.
[03:10.85]Congrats.
[03:12.03]You are the only panda priest in WoW.
[03:17.03]In WoW.
[03:21.56]What?
[03:22.70]We're supposed to kill trainees in here.
[03:23.88]There's no way we're getting, like, a kill for this.
[03:26.10]Are you serious?
[03:27.90]Like, get in here.
[03:28.72]Like, you're supposed to kill six of them.
[03:30.74]Good luck.
[03:33.94]There's no way.
[03:36.40]It's impossible.
[03:38.28]Dude, this is just chaos.
[03:45.62]Wait, did I get hit?
[03:47.73]Oh my god, can we just make a raid and just... Oh, wait, yeah.
[03:51.03]Nice, nice.
[03:51.53]Hold on, you gotta... Oh my god, dude.
[03:56.97]Yeah, like you were saying before, I love how this is supposed to be very, very personal.
[03:59.60]Look at how... Oh, guys, look at how personal this is.
[04:03.31]Take a look at how personal this is.
[04:05.59]I'm being trained by the Shaolin Master Monk.
[04:09.51]And he's training, like, just us.
[04:11.11]Yeah, he's just training me right now.
[04:12.85]Like, I'm being trained, but me and Stealth are the only people in here being trained.
[04:16.04]It's so personal.
[04:16.80]I don't even know where we're supposed to take this.
[04:22.06]Uh, hold on.
[04:24.06]Burn the Edict of Temperance.
[04:29.04]I don't know.
[04:30.48]I don't know.
[04:30.95]I love how everyone's doing the same jump down the stairs.
[04:34.31]Like, it's so... That's one of the most addicting things in Warcraft.
[04:37.37]It's just jumping down the stairs.
[04:39.45]Everybody does it.
[04:41.45]Over the bridge.
[04:42.35]Wait, which bridge?
[04:43.17]This place is awesome looking.
[04:45.04]Just hold on.
[04:45.54]I gotta get into Alt-Z here.
[04:46.98]I wanna... Look at this.
[04:49.54]This is really, really cool.
[04:51.36]Alt-Z, huh?
[04:52.66]Oh, that takes me to the hood.
[04:55.91]Yeah, I'm going to take a look at some stuff first.
[04:59.69]Oh wow, look at that water.
[05:00.71]Look at the stream.
[05:02.63]Everything is so beautiful.
[05:04.30]So finesse.
[05:05.58]So wonderful.
[05:07.88]Yeah, look at this.
[05:12.04]So lovely.
[05:12.60]I just want to live here all day.
[05:15.32]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[05:18.97]Did you die?
[05:19.67]No.
[05:20.81]Oh, it is going to be such a pain in the ass for you to get back up here.
[05:24.86]We gotta wait for the cart driver.
[05:26.56]I wish there was an AOE move.
[05:28.10]Just like that.
[05:29.62]You ready?
[05:30.10]Wait, wait, wait.
[05:32.60]It's gonna... We didn't get it.
[05:37.54]I didn't get any.
[05:38.00]Did you get any?
[05:38.86]Wait, I don't think we were supposed to be killing these.
[05:41.47]We need to kill those because they have the stone splines.
[05:44.13]Oh my god.
[05:45.57]Get ready again.
[05:46.95]You ready?
[05:47.79]Ready?
[05:47.95]No.
[05:48.03]Ready?
[05:48.15]Hold on.
[05:49.61]He spawns right here.
[05:50.79]I'm gonna seriously just go into first person mode.
[05:54.17]Get it!
[05:54.57]Get it!
[05:58.39]Get it!
[05:59.05]One more time.
[05:59.35]Third time's a charm.
[06:04.03]Hold on here.
[06:04.51]This guy's gonna help.
[06:06.45]Here it comes.
[06:07.21]We gotta get it.
[06:07.75]We gotta get it.
[06:08.20]We gotta get credit for it.
[06:11.26]Yes!
[06:12.84]You got that one?
[06:13.58]No, I didn't.
[06:15.60]Hit him!
[06:21.37]Oh my gosh.
[06:24.67]That's so funny.
[06:26.37]I can't believe this is how we're doing this right now.
