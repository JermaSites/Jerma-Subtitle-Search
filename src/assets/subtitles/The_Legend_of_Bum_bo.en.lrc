[00:44.66]It's popped over, I see.
[00:46.58]Roy Mustang, S tier, or Riot.
[00:52.32]Do you think you're on the VOD?
[00:54.26]Oh shit, I thought I was watching the VOD.
[01:00.17]He went live right when that happened.
[01:03.53]So the chat turned into the live chat.
[01:11.81]A new tier list.
[01:13.01]Binding of Isaac bosses.
[01:14.63]Binding of Isaac items.
[01:18.20]No, no more tier lists.
[01:25.18]Sounds like a pretty good list, though.
[01:27.09]It doesn't already exist.
[01:30.19]Yeah, was it like a thousand items in Binding of Isaac?
[01:37.46]But, speaking of Binding of Isaac, what a perfect transition to talk about what we're doing today.
[01:46.12]We are going to... I was going to do this yesterday, but... We spent a little more time in Katamari than I would have imagined.
[01:54.72]And then we did tier lists.
[01:56.74]So this got bumped over to today.
[01:59.46]We are going to play The Legend of Bumbo.
[02:03.68]Which is The Binding of Isaac prequel, but it's a different game!
[02:08.05]These are different games.
[02:10.01]If you think you're gonna get that classic Binding of Isaac gameplay, it's a little different.
[02:14.96]This is a cardboard attack and defend match for video game.
[02:24.16]It's Edmund McMillan, same guy.
[02:26.27]I trust it'll be a fun experience.
[02:34.13]And everything's made out of cardboard.
[02:40.65]So, this stream... I don't know how long this stream is gonna be.
[02:46.23]It might be a few hours, it might be seven, eight.
[02:49.85]Like, I don't know.
[02:50.78]I might get really into this.
[02:52.16]I might think this is a lot of fun.
[02:55.02]I don't know.
[03:00.14]Incoming 30 minutes.
[03:01.28]I think it probably takes like 30 minutes to get through the tutorial.
[03:04.56]So, I doubt that.
[03:06.86]But...
[03:09.63]Something else to talk about very quickly before we move on with this.
[03:13.65]I've just preliminarily started to really start to put the resources in and truly develop the Fuck the King streams.
[03:24.64]They're gonna be way more elaborate than I think anybody thinks.
[03:29.20]We're talking multiple camera angles.
[03:31.10]We're talking about multiple observer views.
[03:35.31]The King Streams are now actively being started now.
[03:43.95]No spoilers.
[03:46.21]You're gonna have to know how this works, though, as we get closer.
[03:49.69]Because there's... You guys need to participate in this stream.
[03:55.81]It can't just be, like, two days before the stream starts and go, Oh, hey, by the way, here's the server info!
[04:01.61]No, there's gonna be all kinds of systems that need to be talked about beforehand.
[04:08.40]This will probably be happening a couple weeks after the new green screen stream.
[04:14.76]Which the new green screen stream, by the way, will probably end up being on date to be determined the first week of December.
[04:24.53]I have to lock that down.
[04:25.63]I have to get the date locked down with the green screen.
[04:28.87]So that means that there's, I was kind of waiting, just waiting a little bit for when I could know I could get in there on a given day to the studio before I actually had the discussion board up.
[04:43.90]So it'll be probably a week or two after the green screen stream, so probably mid-December.
[04:48.77]And it's going to be potentially a weekly, weekly thing that we do, maybe even more than once a week, depends on how fun it is.
[04:57.41]There you go, there's your timeline.
[05:01.08]So, we're going to move to Bumbo.
[05:03.90]I have not... I've opened the game once to make sure that I can capture it.
[05:09.88]What's he talking about?
[05:10.64]I will give way more details when stuff actually starts to glue together.
[05:19.05]But December is going to have some fun streams in it, let's just say that.
[05:23.43]Anyways, time for Bum.
[05:27.76]Let's watch the opening cinematic.
[05:30.08]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[05:36.94]It's actually very soft.
[05:45.46]Bumble live in a box behind house on hill.
[05:49.10]Bumble have trash.
[05:50.14]Bumble have coin.
[05:51.28]Life good.
[05:52.28]Bumble happy.
[05:54.42]That till Bumble hear voice from above.
[05:57.76]That nice coin you have there, Bumble.
[06:00.84]And on you coin, Bumble yell, go away, brother.
[06:05.72]and take coin.
[06:08.34]Then, then, stomp hole.
[06:11.56]Bumble feet fast, grab trash, jump down, hole out the coin.
[06:17.78]Monster try and stop Bumble, but Bumble's lost.
[06:22.51]Bumble use trash and fist to fight them.
[06:28.13]Nothing stop Bumble.
[06:30.13]Bumble, what?
[06:36.76]I loved it.
[06:39.04]Bubba will take trash downstairs.
[06:45.60]Jerma want bits.
[06:46.62]Alright.
[06:48.90]So this is how teaching this tutorial.
[06:51.37]Hit me with some bones, kid.
[06:52.65]I'll give you one move point.
[06:54.87]Use it to line up four bones, then throw that bone my way.
[07:00.67]I think we know what we didn't know.
[07:04.79]Four bones.
[07:07.19]Throw it where?
[07:10.75]So, throw it right down the middle.
[07:13.51]Cool.
[07:16.77]Thanks, I needed that.
[07:18.09]But I need more.
[07:18.79]I'll give you two more points this time.
[07:20.83]But I want you to line up five teeth and throw them straight into my kisser.
[07:31.30]Bumbo, make that.
[07:33.62]Throw teeth down the...
[07:38.31]Okay.
[07:40.31]Wow, that packed punch.
[07:41.41]Teeth and bones both hurt bad when thrown.
[07:44.21]And the more tiles you match up, the more impact they make.
[07:48.07]Experiment with tile combos.
[07:52.33]So if I get two lines, it's like teeth and bone.
[07:57.02]Do I get to throw two?
[08:02.98]Ah, you get to go twice, okay.
[08:04.60]He's dead.
[08:10.30]Hey again, now it's time for me to hit you.
[08:12.30]Okay.
[08:15.42]I'm gonna hit you.
[08:16.93]Whatever you do, don't match four booger tiles and gum me up.
[08:32.41]Stun?
[08:34.05]You gummed up the works there, didn't you?
[08:35.95]Boogers only stop one action by an enemy, so be careful.
[08:39.29]Here I come again.
[08:41.74]Uh-oh.
[08:44.12]So, wait.
[08:44.84]Oh, no.
[08:45.18]Wait, wait, wait.
[08:46.66]How do I cancel that?
[08:49.65]So, here he comes again, so I can't do anything.
[08:52.45]I guess I could go like this.
[08:53.37]This is another turn.
[08:56.15]No, okay, I can do it.
[08:57.46]I'm going to throw a poop at him.
[09:03.40]Oof!
[09:04.42]I just punched a darn poop.
[09:05.94]How'd you know how to do that?
[09:07.78]Oh yeah, poops can shield you from one single enemy attack, but you know that already.
[09:13.56]Okay.
[09:16.22]Now just finish me off and I'll give you a little treat.
[09:20.18]So I get two moves.
[09:21.48]So should I pee on him?
[09:25.62]Plus one move.
[09:26.77]I get it.
[09:27.23]Alright.
[09:38.47]Uh-oh.
[09:40.85]That just finished me off.
[09:43.71]Uh, do they have to be in a row?
[09:45.11]Or can I just, like, drag?
[09:52.22]Can it be, like, die?
[09:52.90]Okay, it'd be in a row.
[09:55.58]Uh-oh.
[09:56.34]I did this wrong.
[10:06.53]Diagonal don't work.
[10:07.29]Okay.
[10:11.22]I'll take the money.
[10:11.96]Yep, me again.
[10:16.04]Wow, I really gave you a run for your money there, didn't I?
[10:18.72]You should probably heal a bit.
[10:20.00]Let me just do heal.
[10:27.08]Okay, this is my health, alright.
[10:28.94]Hearts are a lot less common than other tiles, so don't get used to healing so easily.
[10:34.53]This reminds me of 10 million, but potentially much more interesting for one reason, because apparently there are like hundreds of items in the game.
[10:45.00]Okay, it's time to get crazy now.
[10:47.06]See, each tile you match actually gives you specific colored mana that you can use to cast spells.
[10:54.08]Crazy, huh?
[10:54.84]Here, take this.
[10:55.70]Okay, so I have Bumbo Smash.
[11:01.65]Take- that spell takes bone mana to use, so just match some bones, and when it lights up, click on it and knock my face off.
[11:20.46]Spell's ready.
[11:21.06]Okay.
[11:23.54]So, this is called Bumbo Smash.
[11:30.93]Oh, I just knocked his body off.
[11:32.63]Okay.
[11:33.51]I think you are ready for a real battle, dude.
[11:35.28]Before you go, let me give you a few tips.
[11:38.40]You can visit the casino... Best game ever!
[11:41.60]Best game ever!
[11:42.28]Best game ever!
[11:43.66]After each boss will save those coins.
[11:47.28]Bosses usually have more than one action a turn, so be careful.
[11:56.19]Alright, I think I got the basics done.
[12:02.37]Bumbo Want Coin.
[12:03.49]The Legend of Bumbo.
[12:08.19]New game.
[12:11.30]Choose your Bumbo.
[12:14.56]Bumbo the Brave.
[12:17.08]Bumbo the Nimble.
[12:18.86]Bumbo the Stout.
[12:20.48]Bumbo the Weird.
[12:21.62]Bumbo the Dead.
[12:23.82]Bumbo the Empty.
[12:24.78]Beat the game twice with all characters.
[12:26.38]What are these ones?
[12:28.04]Beat Chapter 1 with Bumbo the Brave.
[12:30.00]Beat Chapter 2 with Bumbo the Nimble.
[12:31.56]Okay.
[12:33.85]So this is, the lower his health, the harder he hits.
[12:36.58]This is just standard, like, Isaac.
[12:39.74]So Bumbo smashes four bones, and then Bumbo shake his two teeth, where he rolls the puzzle board.
[12:54.35]Sewers of Dros?
[12:59.71]Bumbo the Furry.
[13:05.47]Hey, Jeremy, you got a nice looking Bob.
[13:06.57]Thanks.
[13:07.57]Alright, here we go.
[13:09.21]Oh, shit.
[13:09.79]This is a lot.
[13:10.93]Alright, boogers.
[13:11.63]Uh-oh.
[13:12.39]Alright.
[13:14.15]Let's start off with, uh... Huh.
[13:18.04]What do I want to do here first?
[13:19.14]I'm just gonna do boogers.
[13:20.80]No, I got bo- Is it four?
[13:22.12]Okay, I get another move.
[13:27.66]What, do I go right down the middle?
[13:30.78]I'm gonna go right down the middle.
[13:35.40]End your turn.
[13:36.06]Spell is ready.
[13:36.76]Bumbo smash right in the middle.
[13:41.85]Oh, they move.
[13:44.39]Okay, so now my turn again.
[13:48.09]Maybe boogers.
[13:50.89]P?
[13:51.43]Boogers?
[13:52.57]I'm gonna booger.
[13:56.42]Booger on middle.
[13:57.74]And then...
[14:04.39]Teeth on right.
[14:08.45]Oh shit.
[14:09.11]He broke out.
[14:09.59]Right here.
[14:14.74]You're about to attack.
[14:19.06]Re-roll the puzzle board.
[14:19.86]I don't think I need to do that.
[14:23.12]Let me see.
[14:27.73]No one's about to attack and I have one move left.
[14:29.33]So let me go...
[14:34.34]Should I do P?
[14:36.18]Can I get P without... Let me see.
[14:37.80]Uh-oh.
[14:41.55]Wait!
[14:42.79]Fuck, I'm gonna take damage, I think.
[14:46.65]Not quite, they're about to.
[14:47.83]What does P do?
[14:51.52]Oh, P gives me more turns.
[14:53.60]Right, okay.
[14:54.32]Got it, got it.
[14:54.84]Alright.
[14:55.12]I'm gonna bugger right here.
[15:08.45]Got one turn left.
[15:09.21]Can I kill it?
[15:12.17]Nope.
[15:15.71]Shit.
[15:17.85]Is there a poop available?
[15:18.81]There is.
[15:19.13]Right here.
[15:19.41]Alright, I'm ready.
[15:29.13]Good.
[15:30.34]Okay.
[15:31.42]This is fun.
[15:32.46]Okay.
[15:32.88]This is a fun one.
[15:35.32]I'm going teeth.
[15:37.22]Teeth on the left.
[15:38.32]No, yeah, teeth on the left.
[15:48.13]And then in turn, he's gonna queue up.
[15:51.31]Alright, I got two turns to kill this thing.
[15:53.07]I got it right here.
[15:53.67]Give me more money.
[16:03.70]Free coins!
[16:06.80]Uh... What is this?
[16:08.74]This is a tre- Oh, this is an item.
[16:10.68]Snot Rocket?
[16:11.92]Is a booger- A booger lane.
[16:13.97]A navy bean.
[16:14.79]Destroy a column of tiles.
[16:21.31]This is four, four, and two.
[16:23.49]That seems like a lot.
[16:29.28]Alright, got the booger lane.
[16:32.90]I need to get four, then four, and then two peas.
[16:36.24]Alright, let me see what I wanna do here.
[16:41.08]It's not rocket yet.
[16:42.34]Alright, I'm gonna go... I can do just bone immediately.
[16:49.85]Does that set me up for anything after that?
[16:51.87]Rocket, whatever, just whip it.
[16:58.23]And then, no, not Bumbo Smash.
[17:00.51]Ahhhh.
[17:00.97]I could do... Teeth right down the middle, Bumbo Smash right down the middle.
[17:04.61]Alright, middle lane gone.
[17:14.45]This board's good.
[17:18.35]I'll keep it.
[17:20.27]Oh shit, they've ranged.
[17:23.79]Those guys have ranged.
[17:24.76]Uh oh.
[17:29.11]Wait, hold on.
[17:29.99]That's three, and then I could do poo, but... Give me that.
[17:42.37]Give me this.
[17:54.79]Fuck, he's gonna attack.
[18:02.72]Does this take up the whole lane?
[18:05.94]I'm curious.
[18:06.60]Let me see if this works.
[18:09.20]Like, with the attacks, will it hit that?
[18:11.84]Yep.
[18:12.16]Oh, cool.
[18:12.76]Alright.
[18:14.83]Cool.
[18:15.09]Very cool.
[18:16.03]I got it.
[18:17.59]Well, now I'm in trouble again.
[18:18.43]Do I have enough?
[18:21.21]Do I have a P scenario?
[18:24.25]I can do five booger.
[18:26.75]I can booger this whole lane.
[18:27.99]I can booger this lane.
[18:30.50]And then I'm gonna do a super booger on the... Like, right over here?
[18:36.76]This is five boogers!
[18:39.30]I can do it twice!
[18:40.10]Let's go.
[18:49.07]Okay.
[18:49.99]Now I gotta start killing shit.
[18:54.55]I could do... I've got bones here.
[18:59.51]I can do bone.
[19:00.31]I need pee.
[19:04.23]Dammit.
[19:05.03]Alright, wait.
[19:05.53]Hear me out on this one.
[19:06.59]Hear me out on this.
[19:07.15]This is stupid, but I'm gonna do it.
[19:09.07]That's six bones.
[19:11.93]How many throws is that?
[19:12.72]Two.
[19:14.54]Three.
[19:14.68]Oh, shit!
[19:28.08]That's actually a really good idea!
[19:29.38]Now I can just Bumbo Smash him.
[19:35.73]Yeah, kill him.
[19:41.17]Do I like this board?
[19:41.99]What do you guys think?
[19:43.63]Seven is a super combo.
[19:49.74]Nanodrain, what the hell was that?
[19:51.06]Alright.
[19:54.62]I got Teeth and I got Bone here.
[19:57.92]I wish I could split this up, but I'll do teeth and then I'll do bone.
[20:01.30]No.
[20:02.44]Bone and then teeth.
[20:09.10]How much damage does the bone do?
[20:11.70]It doesn't matter.
[20:12.42]It's only one damage, right?
[20:15.31]Okay.
[20:26.52]Kill it.
[20:27.10]Let's go.
[20:31.38]New item.
[20:32.78]Coming up.
[20:37.19]Alright.
[20:37.73]Flying insects.
[20:38.63]What do they do?
[20:44.69]I'm assuming they just keep going forward.
[20:53.39]What does this mean up here?
[20:56.81]Is this just nothing, or just, what does this mean?
[21:00.37]It's what falls down after, okay.
[21:01.78]Unless it comes next, like Tetris style, I get it.
[21:05.98]Alright, we're gonna booger.
[21:07.26]Hmm.
[21:16.98]Booger, I, wait, can I do P too?
[21:18.74]Booger.
[21:20.62]Alright, hold on, watch this.
[21:30.09]That was pointless.
[21:33.43]I thought I was going to get more turns to then do this.
[21:35.63]It's alright.
[21:36.15]I'm sorry.
[21:36.57]You're going to make a mistake once.
[21:38.89]Or many times.
[21:42.95]How do I salvage this?
[21:44.97]I just fucked a seven bone.
[21:46.65]God damn it.
[21:49.89]Whatever.
[21:50.11]I'm just going to line up these bones here.
[21:53.25]No one's doing anything yet.
[21:58.37]Let's go right down the middle.
[21:59.41]Wait, let me make sure.
[22:00.29]There you go, up top first.
[22:09.48]Bone smash, I wonder if- no, save it.
[22:11.24]Don't use it.
[22:14.44]Do I have anything else I could do?
[22:16.04]No, boogers are in the wrong spot.
[22:29.83]I wonder, just... Are these guys, do they attack?
[22:32.71]Or is it just that they get close enough to hurt you?
[22:40.76]Six boogers is an AoE.
[22:44.14]Um, I don't want to reroll this yet.
[22:45.30]Uh oh.
[22:47.98]Okay, now... Uh... I need to make some poos.
[22:58.62]One, two, ugh, what if I set up like a whole row, a whole... You need seven for AoE, damn it.
[23:06.71]I could do one.
[23:09.37]I could do this, and then poo.
[23:11.87]Let's see if this helps me at all.
[23:13.25]I'm not sure where to go with this though.
[23:19.94]Kind of playing defense.
[23:25.66]And then, how about right here?
[23:29.32]And then, um... I'm gonna kill this with Bumble and Smash.
[23:40.23]I can booger the lane next.
[23:41.45]Alright, you're about to go.
[23:43.41]I'm gonna keep that there.
[23:44.17]So... Cool.
[23:52.00]Alright, so they don't attack.
[23:55.83]You do not take damage unless this pops up, right?
[24:01.99]This is like that you're about to take damage.
[24:03.47]It's not just they just walk forward and hit you, right?
[24:11.14]Oh, we got a bone here.
[24:14.80]Wait.
[24:15.58]Let's see.
[24:17.38]I could do bone and then smash.
[24:21.91]Yeah, let's just bone it.
[24:28.33]And then smash right down the middle.
[24:32.84]Oh, shit.
[24:33.58]It's in the air.
[24:34.72]Uh-oh.
[24:36.12]Alright, I'll booger this whole lane.
[24:39.84]Whoa!
[24:40.30]What just happened?
[24:40.94]What?
[24:43.86]Why did that do damage?
[24:51.73]Oh, it was poo shields.
[24:54.19]Oh, fuck.
[24:59.03]Oh, no.
[24:59.97]Okay, I get it.
[25:00.81]So that was poo shields for the... I get it.
[25:03.86]Damn it.
[25:05.46]That's cool.
[25:11.97]Alright, well, I got an opportunity here.
[25:14.33]I might reroll this.
[25:15.15]Nah, I don't have to.
[25:20.13]Just teeth and then just, I can wait it out.
[25:26.85]Yeah, you're gonna run into that and I'll be fine.
[25:52.35]Did I just poop that?
[25:58.57]I could do an extra.
[26:03.05]Ooh!
[26:05.43]Ooh!
[26:07.63]Cool, alright.
[26:10.08]Uh, here, we'll take that.
[26:13.72]Wait, I could do a super poop.
[26:16.06]Hold on, everybody, I could do this.
[26:18.58]I could go, I could do, what does five poos do?
[26:23.51]No no no, what is six poo- holy shit, could I get a huge one?
[26:30.38]I could do six poos.
[26:31.40]I'll just do five.
[26:39.23]Just wanna see what happens.
[26:50.47]This is stars.
[26:51.39]Oh, it's wild?
[26:58.87]Oh, that's cool.
[26:59.62]Wild.
[27:00.00]Ooh, well, I could do a big heal.
[27:06.20]Spell ready.
[27:06.72]Booger lane.
[27:07.40]No.
[27:08.02]Oh, alright.
[27:08.46]Let's just go.
[27:15.14]I'm gonna do five bones.
[27:21.06]No, I'm not.
[27:25.88]Can I even do four right now?
[27:30.20]This looks pretty neat, to be honest.
[27:31.62]It is.
[27:32.04]It actually is pretty cool.
[27:36.33]That's what I like to see.
[27:43.05]And I can bumble smash.
[27:47.75]Does this save between floors?
[27:52.85]I can hold, is this, no, they did, no, okay.
[28:01.23]Okay, eight coins, ooh.
[28:06.22]Plus one movement.
[28:09.48]Or trapdoor, skip to next chapter.
[28:12.80]I don't wanna skip to, this is my first time, this is my first game.
[28:19.08]Let's take the juice.
[28:24.35]Bumbo vs. Peeper.
[28:25.91]His eyes are slippery.
[28:27.03]15 health.
[28:32.35]Oh, fuck.
[28:34.95]Okay, so I can do... I probably have to freeze them or slow them.
[28:50.17]What if I just try to damage?
[28:57.04]Because I could do one bone.
[28:58.54]I could do bone and then movement.
[29:00.20]Check this.
[29:06.08]Do they have health?
[29:07.18]Should I attack him?
[29:08.14]I'm going for him.
[29:11.64]Now check this out.
[29:12.67]One movement.
[29:13.97]Bingo.
[29:15.77]Sticky.
[29:18.19]On... You.
[29:24.27]I guess.
[29:27.96]Oh.
[29:36.54]Can I stick?
[29:37.12]I could stick that.
[29:38.96]But then we would have been blocked anyways.
[29:40.28]Alright.
[29:41.94]Thank you.
[29:48.87]This is not good.
[29:49.51]I could have teeth.
[29:53.29]But can I even hit you?
[29:55.43]This is just...
[29:59.18]resisted.
[30:01.55]But these don't take any damage.
[30:03.31]Okay.
[30:06.29]So, the play is you gotta stick these.
[30:08.71]Sticky, sticky, and then hit them.
[30:10.75]Or move them by swinging at them.
[30:12.03]Okay.
[30:15.67]He hasn't moved, though, but... Well, let's see what happens.
[30:19.65]Oh, this is not good.
[30:22.09]I need poo.
[30:23.53]Right now.
[30:24.65]Right... Uh-oh, I need two poos.
[30:25.91]I'm gonna get hit.
[30:30.80]Can I get an extra turn out of this?
[30:39.10]Yes!
[30:39.78]Yes!
[30:42.64]That was poo and an extra move.
[30:47.88]Alright.
[30:49.40]Oh, look at all these moves.
[30:50.48]Okay, this is important.
[30:51.98]I don't want to fuck this up, but I'm going to.
[30:53.56]I could do booger over here.
[31:00.10]I could do Super Poo, but is that gonna help me?
[31:05.64]Does it stack?
[31:07.36]Oh, shit!
[31:13.45]Does- will this- will this- will this poo stack?
[31:16.33]See how it says 1?
[31:23.51]Let's try it.
[31:26.03]Oh, yes, it does.
[31:27.31]It does stack.
[31:29.75]Nice, alright.
[31:31.76]Then, oh, look at that!
[31:32.90]Look at that, I can do five bones!
[31:35.88]Wait, I can do more than that!
[31:37.32]I can do six bones!
[31:40.70]Wait, don't do that!
[31:43.93]Because that's four.
[31:49.17]But I can't hit him.
[31:50.31]No, I'm not going to do it.
[31:50.97]Can I just end the turn?
[31:54.13]I can do an extra turn, but will that help me?
[31:56.02]Maybe bones?
[31:57.44]Maybe I should move the bone down.
[32:01.11]Wait, wait, wait.
[32:01.63]How many turns do I have?
[32:02.79]No, I can't hit him.
[32:06.77]Okay, what if I do this?
[32:09.31]Put this here.
[32:12.93]Or should I move?
[32:13.68]Fuck.
[32:15.20]I'm gonna put this here.
[32:18.48]And then... Go for seven.
[32:24.32]I don't think I'm too slow for that.
[32:26.78]Do seven teeth.
[32:27.90]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[32:29.60]I could go...
[32:31.69]Alright.
[32:32.35]If this is wrong, it's wrong.
[32:33.71]If it's wrong, I'm stupid, and I messed it up.
[32:35.69]But you gotta mess up at least once.
[32:37.33]Ready?
[32:38.95]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[32:43.39]This is gonna be... Oh, I fucked it up!
[32:52.98]I was gonna try to go for six bones.
[32:54.70]I fucked it up, because the whole thing... Oh, no, wait, no, I didn't.
[32:58.52]I can still do it.
[33:00.96]I can get it...
[33:03.18]One, two, three, four, five.
[33:04.82]I'll have six.
[33:05.86]Okay, I'll have six bones.
[33:10.52]Maybe more.
[33:11.16]Seven.
[33:15.82]I gotta move this out of the way, though.
[33:19.12]Alright, here's the game plan.
[33:19.97]You ready?
[33:21.57]Throw teeth, move that out of the way.
[33:23.01]Uh, fuck.
[33:27.15]This whole thing is messed up.
[33:29.59]I'm gonna connect four anyways.
[33:33.87]Well, I'm... Damn it.
[33:35.15]I'm upset.
[33:36.90]So, I can't do 17th.
[33:40.70]Because if I go up from here, I'm going to connect... Hold on.
[33:45.84]Because that's four.
[33:48.32]This is four.
[33:52.22]Can I go over?
[33:54.14]Can I do this?
[33:55.32]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[33:57.70]Okay, hold on.
[34:02.62]Yes, I'm doing teeth.
[34:03.88]No, I'm doing bones.
[34:09.01]Seven.
[34:10.53]So if I go this way.
[34:12.57]Alright, alright, alright.
[34:13.85]So he's saying, bang.
[34:15.73]Right here.
[34:16.09]Then bring it up to make three.
[34:18.27]Then bring the wild down to make seven.
[34:25.20]What do you mean no?
[34:27.34]Teeth, not bones.
[34:28.04]What are you talking about?
[34:31.66]That's not correct?
[34:32.52]That's going to take too long.
[34:35.46]Slide the third from the top to the left.
[34:43.13]Third row left.
[34:54.13]You mean like right here?
[34:54.93]And then just go up and then down.
[34:59.51]I'm going to connect...
[35:05.64]You mean like this?
[35:06.68]I see what you're saying.
[35:07.66]You guys are fucking pretty good.
[35:14.51]Well, my way would have done it too.
[35:16.63]Yeah, my way would have done it.
[35:26.92]Perfect.
[35:29.18]Our way is better.
[35:32.72]Alright, here we go.
[35:34.58]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven teeth.
[35:39.90]Alright, it does... It does four damage to everything.
[35:49.69]Okay, that's cool.
[35:54.17]I guess I could go... Let me see.
[35:55.87]I could just booger the lane.
[36:04.93]Should I get the extra turn?
[36:13.37]Okay, I got the little move, and I'm gonna go here.
[36:19.83]Give me a, uh... Eh, I probably shouldn't have even done that.
[36:27.17]But I don't know why I did that.
[36:31.45]I saw one guy.
[36:33.11]Alright, so we got one.
[36:35.74]Can I do a seven bone?
[36:39.34]One, two, three.
[36:40.70]Hold on.
[36:41.18]One, two, three.
[36:48.72]Okay, down.
[36:49.58]Alright, here we go.
[36:51.12]You ready?
[36:51.56]I gotta set up the seven bone scenario.
[36:55.10]That'd be one, two, three, four, five, six.
[36:57.82]Okay, I'm setting up the seven bone.
[37:07.13]Let me make sure it is right.
[37:08.23]Then two... Wait.
[37:19.35]And then... okay.
[37:20.09]Let's do it.
[37:22.55]Should I do this now?
[37:26.93]Because I'm... they're blocking the way.
[37:31.80]What does it do?
[37:39.74]Oh, I just fucking destroyed him.
[37:42.27]Holy shit, that's the best thing in the whole game.
[37:49.53]How much damage does that do?
[38:01.87]But Bumble noticed a thing.
[38:04.15]Weird box in back of room.
[38:07.05]What in there, Bumble think?
[38:09.63]Spider with long butt?
[38:12.09]Big long bone?
[38:14.47]Bee with magic powers?
[38:17.41]It a mystery.
[38:19.05]With no thinking, Bumble bash open scary box.
[38:24.24]What this?
[38:25.96]Another Bumble?
[38:27.68]What a twist!
[38:30.95]Bumbo the Nimble has been unlocked.
[38:32.73]Just Kayn.
[38:37.49]Forlorn Hollow has unlocked.
[38:39.51]I cheated.
[38:41.37]We gotta do it again.
[38:42.73]That's been Bumbo, guys!
[38:58.84]So we unlock the next area after that.
[39:04.99]Okay.
[39:05.23]Let's do it again.
[39:14.13]New game.
[39:16.69]Let's see, what's the new Bumbo do?
[39:21.83]His puzzle attacks gain mana.
[39:27.80]With two teeth.
[39:28.36]Remove a single tile.
[39:31.11]Damage goes up with each hit.
[39:35.15]What?
[39:37.55]I'll try.
[39:43.54]What'd that bumbo do?
[39:44.32]Let's do it again.
[39:53.95]Each cast of the spell in a single room.
[39:58.31]Alright, so they have their own poo shields.
[40:03.98]I'm going right up the middle.
[40:06.80]Set up the fucking... bones.
[40:10.56]Uh... I'm just gonna... whatever.
[40:15.58]I could do this.
[40:16.12]Get gum up the middle.
[40:22.18]And then... I could set up a five bone scenario.
[40:25.88]A six bone scenario.
[40:28.75]Yeah, that's what we're doing.
[40:38.54]Fucked it up.
[40:40.36]Uh, I didn't.
[40:42.05]This is what we like to call fucking wasting time.
[40:50.82]Ooh!
[41:01.34]Let's go!
[41:04.42]What?
[41:11.34]Were they different moves?
[41:12.86]Oh, it's five.
[41:17.58]Five damage.
[41:19.02]I thought it was like the big tooth that comes down.
[41:23.99]Alright, so it's, if it's, it has to be seven, not more than like five, okay?
[41:30.19]Seven is the big one, I get it.
[41:32.99]Oh, you know when you just, like, when a run gets fucked up, you know what I mean?
[41:36.03]Uh, well, I, I think I die.
[41:40.68]We'll find out, see if I can live.
[41:50.16]He softlocked it.
[41:53.75]Now I can do a bunch of P. How many will that give me?
[41:56.13]One, two, three, four, five... I can't do the six, can I?
[42:00.64]I have to get all of this P. That'll give me a... I only have two moves.
[42:13.81]I'm gonna get hit.
[42:14.45]I'm dead.
[42:22.29]I can drink six in two.
[42:24.51]Can I?
[42:27.13]This has to go forward and down.
[42:28.41]That's five.
[42:29.73]Forward, down.
[42:30.51]That's... I guess I could do this.
[42:34.57]Yeah, okay.
[42:35.19]What do I do?
[42:37.95]Not that good.
[42:38.95]Just, what, two more moves?
[42:43.64]What?
[42:44.00]Oh, actually, that did help a lot.
[42:45.40]Wait a minute.
[42:45.84]I get three, one.
[42:47.48]One, two, three.
[43:00.43]See you later.
[43:06.68]No!
[43:08.38]Wait!
[43:13.92]I'm dead.
[43:23.84]Alright, no more joking around.
[43:25.36]It's time for the real one.
[43:29.65]Uh, let's do... I had more?
[43:32.22]What?
[43:33.36]I could have done it again.
[43:34.34]Yeah, only one more time.
[43:35.62]It's only one damage.
[43:37.44]What?
[43:37.70]Really?
[43:38.00]Alright, let's get serious.
[43:43.00]What do I even want to do here?
[43:49.88]A lot of flying enemies.
[43:52.64]Let's do... Eh.
[43:58.60]Goes up one damage every time.
[44:08.73]So what can I start to set up here?
[44:12.21]I can set up the bones.
[44:13.01]If I bring this over here, that goes... One, two, three.
[44:20.30]Oh, check this.
[44:20.92]Yeah, let's do it.
[44:23.26]Let's do a seven bone setup.
[44:28.74]I'm gonna take damage here, though.
[44:30.18]It's worth it.
[44:33.12]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[44:34.18]I'm gonna take... It's not worth it, but I'm gonna do it.
[44:41.25]It's not worth it.
[44:41.89]Like, I don't even know why I keep doing it.
[44:45.45]I'm dead.
[44:45.97]Again.
[44:50.21]It's not worth it.
[45:00.31]The ultimate greed.
[45:01.45]Yeah, I'm dead.
[45:02.13]Because no, I can't survive this.
[45:08.54]Could have had the seven.
[45:09.60]Oh, whatever.
[45:11.98]Yeah, restart, restart, restart, restart.
[45:14.42]New game.
[45:15.80]I'm not just going to set up seven and eight scenarios this whole time.
[45:19.43]Quitter.
[45:31.16]No, it's not about getting, like, rows of seven.
[45:33.71]It's about trying to control these little mutants.
[45:36.53]Alright, rocks.
[45:43.56]I don't know what they do.
[45:44.60]That's a bomb.
[45:45.14]I don't know what that does.
[45:45.88]Let's, uh, start with this.
[45:52.86]Uh, let's just go poop.
[46:03.60]to do p get set up a 5p yeah I'll do a 5p setup here that's 6p setup sorry no it's not stop stop doing six and seven p setups no it's not worth it just do the five
[46:28.67]Oh, I can get seven.
[46:29.65]No, stop going for seven.
[46:31.21]I don't have to go for seven every time.
[46:32.85]What's wrong with me?
[46:34.57]I'm just doing five.
[46:36.53]Okay, here we go.
[46:39.05]You gotta go for it.
[46:40.63]I can't just set up five and six.
[46:45.42]Alright, but I can do this.
[47:00.64]How many teeths do I got?
[47:01.44]See?
[47:11.85]Yeah, I don't have... Oh, I could get... I could do like a row of ten.
[47:16.15]You're dead by the time you get there.
[47:20.71]Enemies move slower.
[47:21.77]Stopwatch.
[47:22.33]Buzz down.
[47:22.95]Move a tile column one down.
[47:30.20]That one seems cool.
[47:34.62]So that's four bones.
[47:37.08]Alright, we got two fla... The bomb in the back.
[47:39.08]Poops are here.
[47:40.76]We can set up a... We can set up a fucking 16th scenario.
[47:55.07]Oh, what's that?
[47:55.59]We can get a 16th scenario.
[47:59.11]Wait.
[48:03.11]I, uh... This is gonna do five damage.
[48:06.87]Right?
[48:07.35]I gotta remember how that works.
[48:12.12]It's five damage.
[48:14.70]Okay.
[48:15.02]Five.
[48:21.18]Yeah, right.
[48:21.70]Don't do that ever again.
[48:24.77]Uh...
[48:34.90]I'm gonna have to take a hit.
[48:39.09]Ooh!
[48:39.19]Sorry.
[48:40.09]The bomb is getting close, though.
[48:48.09]Use the toothpick?
[48:50.46]I can't.
[48:50.88]I need a bunch of peat for that.
[48:56.20]Remove a single tile.
[48:57.38]I could do this.
[49:01.55]Give me a little more time and then I could toothpick the Okay free moves this might be a set up the bone scenario If I go down No No, it's not worth it just get this I have to kill something I
[49:32.32]I'm not doing seven bumps!
[49:52.09]Use the Needle?
[49:52.63]It's only gonna do one damage.
[49:53.59]I'm gonna save it.
[49:54.73]I get three moves.
[50:02.32]I go down, and then left, and then I have to hit something.
[50:11.79]Do seven bones or riot.
[50:13.39]No, I'm not doing seven fucking bones.
[50:16.42]I can't.
[50:18.18]It's gonna take me too much time.
[50:19.74]I could do like this, which is, that's not even correct.
[50:24.12]I don't even know, I don't even see what you're saying.
[50:34.65]Need poo to protect against the bomb fly.
[50:36.47]Wait, is it gonna explode?
[50:43.07]Pop the stuff under the bones?
[50:46.94]You mean like here?
[50:54.48]What do you mean pop under the bones?
[50:55.70]You mean like pop... Alright, but how many... I have one... I only have like an elite as well.
[51:07.59]I'm talking about pop like here, drag this down.
[51:11.67]God, I can't believe I'm doing like a seven setup.
[51:15.08]You guys are gonna get me killed.
[51:16.34]I need to get a tooth here first, don't I?
[51:33.19]No.
[51:38.31]Seven bones.
[51:39.28]Oh my god.
[51:43.10]I can get seven bones this turn.
[51:54.70]You want to pop this one?
[51:59.58]This pop... Yes, no, yes, no.
[52:03.15]Alright, I'm just gonna... I'm popping it.
[52:11.97]I have three moves, so then I go over here, which is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[52:19.95]Bring this one down.
[52:20.83]Yeah, this is it.
[52:31.77]Yeah!
[52:37.36]Seven bones.
[52:38.84]Only seven bones.
[52:42.88]What did I take damage for?
[52:52.32]How does the bomb fly?
[52:53.30]Okay.
[52:54.87]This is an easier room, I think.
[53:00.01]Um... Just kill it.
[53:10.60]And I have... Ooh, enemies move slower.
[53:12.55]Should I just do that?
[53:13.87]What does it do?
[53:14.35]I have no... What does it do?
[53:16.79]Next wave of baddies move less.
[53:18.93]Alright, cool.
[53:21.29]17th!
[53:22.03]17th!
[53:22.75]17th!
[53:23.49]17th!
[53:24.51]17th!
[53:31.89]17th!
[53:32.23]I don't care about optimal.
[53:34.34]Reverse, like, calculate every 7 move.
[53:37.34]I just want to... I'm playing it.
[53:47.11]every move must have at least five to seven tiles removed each turn or inefficient ineffective so I'm gonna do I have one move can I do anything with this one move I set up seven teeth or is it up five teeth who cares
[55:05.22]I'm thinking.
[55:05.92]I'm thinking.
[55:09.78]Speak.
[55:10.14]I'm thinking.
[55:10.78]I'm trying to think.
[55:13.93]I'm thinking if I drop... I don't know.
[55:15.69]I can move just over.
[55:18.75]Just... Hold on.
[55:19.91]I got it.
[55:20.35]I've got it figured out.
[55:21.63]I'm going to drag this over and I'm going to drop and I'm going to get fucking five poops.
[55:25.84]Check it out.
[55:26.34]And you're going to be very proud of me.
[55:40.91]Told you you're gonna be proud of me.
[55:50.64]Alright, now... We're gonna go with... This, because I feel like it.
[56:06.59]That was a huge mistake.
[56:09.77]But it's okay.
[56:16.58]Wait, maybe not, maybe not, maybe not.
[56:17.92]I think I can do it still.
[56:19.74]Yeah, hold on.
[56:20.92]No, that's not a bone up there.
[56:22.54]What about a tooth?
[56:23.20]I need a tooth to drop right here.
[56:25.54]Okay, wait.
[56:26.52]Everybody, watch this shit.
[56:29.22]This is what we call problem solving.
[56:40.83]Alright, Butterbean.
[56:41.70]Knock back all enemies.
[56:44.26]Plus one coin.
[56:48.14]Knock back all enemies.
[56:53.45]Bumbo versus the Duke.
[56:54.67]Keep him small.
[56:58.65]Spell ready.
[56:59.55]Do I only use this once?
[57:00.77]I can use this one time.
[57:03.81]Alright, give me... Chat, give me a seven bone scenario.
[57:06.88]Let's do it.
[57:07.38]Let's set it up.
[57:14.28]There's one, two.
[57:17.36]Three, four.
[57:23.53]One, two, three, four, five.
[57:25.93]Move the one top to the right, down.
[57:28.75]No, fuck, I'm just... Stay still.
[57:43.94]And make him move slower.
[57:49.52]And... Give me some more moves.
[57:57.45]Not yet.
[57:57.75]7P.
[57:59.99]Yep.
[58:11.97]This is not going to activate it, right?
[58:14.57]7P!
[58:15.31]So this is going to be 1, 2, uh... Is this even going to work?
[58:27.22]If I move, okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[58:36.78]You can't.
[58:37.72]OMEGALUL.
[58:40.06]Hold on.
[58:40.78]Just wait.
[58:46.52]Up, and then up.

[60:31.31]Needle again.
[60:33.93]Bang.
[60:35.63]And then... What's that?
[60:37.81]Oh, I'm sorry.
[60:38.51]I haven't been slowed down.
[60:40.18]Fucking idiot.
[60:45.38]And then, yeah, just for fun.
[60:47.94]Just because you're ugly.
[60:49.04]You know what I mean?
[61:02.17]Okay, that's two rounds of stun.
[61:03.39]Let's add to our pool collection.
[61:20.80]Set up a bone scenario over here.
[61:22.18]Okay, nice shot, idiot.
[61:32.45]Seven bone scenario.
[61:35.59]Is there?
[61:37.14]I mean, I could drop this tile here, move over, move down.
[61:40.88]Wait, hold on.
[61:41.50]Are you guys for real?
[61:42.14]There's a seven bone scenario coming up?
[61:44.72]What if I go here?
[61:46.26]No.
[61:46.94]Here.
[61:48.32]Drop the tile there.
[61:49.16]Hmm.
[61:58.13]Let me think about this.
[61:59.25]I can remove two tiles.
[62:00.59]So let's go bang right here.
[62:05.19]I get a, I get a bone here!
[62:06.41]You can remove three, I can remove, wait, hold on, two, two, four, six, holy shit, I can do three tile removes, okay.
[62:18.12]Alright, so I'm gonna remove, we need to have a communication way to be able to talk to me in chat.
[62:24.48]Remember, think of, it's a board, right?
[62:27.19]So we're gonna say four, like this is one, two, three, four, okay?
[62:32.76]This is 1, 2, 3, 4.
[62:35.46]If you want me to see something, you have to say, 1!
[62:38.50]Or like, 2!
[62:39.60]2, 3!
[62:39.76]2-3!
[62:39.98]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

[63:05.01]You seeing a scenario?
[63:10.70]Now everyone's all fucked up.
[63:11.90]I'm gonna do... I'm doing 2-2.
[63:12.92]2-2, 2-3.
[63:13.18]2-2, 2-3, 2-3.
[63:13.34]That's my play.
[63:14.98]2-2, 2-3, 2-3.
[63:15.14]Right?
[63:15.30]That's what I'm saying.
[63:16.88]2-2...
[63:33.77]two three one two three four that's only six hold on wait oh fuck wait a minute
[64:07.03]Okay, I fucked it up.
[64:09.51]And then I can do 2-2, down, and then next round do it.
[64:17.01]Okay, 2-2, down, and then back the fuck up.
[64:29.48]I win.
[64:45.56]You gotta give me info.
[64:49.66]2, 1.
[64:49.70]2, 2.
[64:50.02]4, 4.
[64:51.58]Full heal.
[64:53.12]Teeth deal plus 1 damage.
[64:54.78]That's... Okay, these are both insane.
[65:04.51]Does this mean I can use it whenever I want?
[65:07.53]Or does that mean it happens right now, and that's it?
[65:13.23]Just once.
[65:14.73]Okay.
[65:15.19]I'm gonna go with the teeth damage.
[65:16.55]I like that better.
[65:20.83]The stat wheel.
[65:23.40]Fifteen cents for... Hold on.
[65:25.76]This is a casino.
[65:28.04]Oh, fuck.
[65:30.34]Randomized needle.
[65:31.38]What else is here?
[65:34.96]Five cents for... Heart or item worth...
[65:44.30]It's the shell game.
[65:45.72]Uh, that's a lot.
[65:48.48]Randomize... reroll the spell.
[65:53.06]Spell charge less.
[65:56.75]Man, I need a spell cost less.
[65:59.53]Spin the wheel.
[66:01.67]You never play the wheel at the casino.
[66:03.01]It's the worst thing to do.
[66:12.44]What does that do?
[66:14.38]Oh, cool.
[66:14.96]Great.
[66:15.44]I got extra luck.
[66:16.28]Alright, I'm going for it.
[66:21.04]Whoa!
[66:25.76]There's no way anyone could figure that out.
[66:28.32]They make it look... No.
[66:29.70]Nobody saw the end of that.
[66:32.08]Nobody did.
[66:36.12]Spells change each room.
[66:41.04]I wish I had a heal, though.
[66:45.60]Oh my god, is there?
[66:47.16]You can just buy one.
[66:55.66]I have no more money.
[66:58.58]Into the Forlorn Hollow.
[67:02.26]So what's the trinket that I just got?
[67:10.76]Randomized spells?
[67:13.31]Oh, this is all different now.
[67:14.75]Once it hits three random enemies... Oh, this is... Actually, I don't like that.
[67:23.89]Destroy a column of tiles and then blind an enemy.
[67:29.41]Alright, well, whatever.
[67:31.53]I guess maybe you could give us a scenario... Does this last the whole time I'm down here?
[67:35.57]I'm going to do that more often.
[67:36.59]I'm sorry.
[67:37.63]Alright.
[67:37.89]I don't like this board.
[67:45.15]I need to do Bones though, because I have the Bone Trinket.
[67:47.14]So, we're doing Bones.
[67:49.20]I'm thinking, let's see... Bang?
[67:52.76]Yeah!
[67:53.26]Oh!
[67:53.96]Oh!
[67:54.36]Ah!
[67:54.68]Oh!
[67:57.60]And then I... Oh!
[68:02.37]What's that?
[68:03.73]I call that a... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Bone Scenario!
[68:21.94]Back the fuck up.
[68:32.87]So that's... Let me see.
[68:34.35]Oh, I don't... No, fuck!
[68:35.75]I don't have my thing!
[68:37.05]My thing to break tiles.
[68:38.11]Hold on, let me see.
[68:38.75]One, two, three.
[68:40.63]One, two, three.
[68:41.55]I can do it next turn.
[68:47.82]I'm gonna win.
[68:49.46]Am I gonna die?
[69:00.21]Alright, I win.
[69:16.23]I don't think that was worth losing a full heart for, though.
[69:18.64]Alright, this is pepper and number one.
[69:23.70]Movement, gaining, attack.
[69:27.80]Ooh.
[69:29.57]That takes a lot of resources, but it's really cool.
[69:34.19]Booger and knockback.
[69:35.33]I already have a knockback.
[69:36.21]I'm not buying the ghost pepper.
[69:41.21]This one is a damn... You do damage, and you get a move.
[69:47.53]I can stay alive.
[69:48.20]Alright, no more fucking around.
[69:51.42]What is this?
[69:51.84]I...
[69:55.82]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[69:56.76]Everything's random every time.
[69:58.72]Skipped the next chapter.
[70:00.42]Does that do it?
[70:05.08]There is no next chapter.
[70:06.08]I haven't unlocked it yet.
[70:13.23]Okay, well, we're fine.
[70:17.97]Hmm, alright.
[70:19.59]I don't know what these guys do.
[70:20.69]Four?
[70:20.79]Well, I'm gonna have to put some poo down, I think, and yeah, let's gum it up a little.
[70:31.34]Uh, let's throw a tooth.
[70:42.83]Two damage, nice.
[70:43.71]Oh, Stink Claw.
[70:49.19]Okay.
[70:53.23]P, I could just... I could move and just get some... No, shit.
[70:57.05]Alright, I could do P. And just kind of recalibrate.
[71:04.92]No, I can't.
[71:09.20]I need the P, though, for this.
[71:10.46]Alright, hold on.
[71:22.03]Wait.
[71:22.87]No, I have to.
[71:23.51]I just gotta, I gotta get this fucking going.
[71:31.31]I didn't kill the turtle, baby.
[71:35.79]What is this thing doing?
[71:36.61]Blinding attack?
[71:39.55]Gain plus one damage for the room.
[71:45.34]What?
[71:48.70]Blind.
[71:49.00]I wish I'd blind.
[71:55.44]I think I... This is just a shield, isn't it?
[71:57.92]Alright.
[72:01.51]I'm hitting harder in the room.
[72:03.33]Gain mana equals to most common tile.
[72:08.13]What?
[72:10.43]Pooh?
[72:15.11]So if I gain... So I'm going to gain 6 Pooh mana, but I don't even use Pooh mana.
[72:19.56]So this is again...
[72:25.05]Okay, I'm just doing it again.
[72:32.22]Where the fuck did this come from?
[72:33.60]Alright, I gotta... Um... Right down the middle, I gotta get rid of this.
[72:46.74]I gotta kill this thing.
[72:48.59]Seven poo.
[72:50.29]No, I'm gonna die!
[72:51.47]I gotta do bones.
[72:52.29]I gotta do bones.
[72:57.79]Can I do bones twice?
[73:02.23]No.
[73:03.09]I can kill the thing that's about to attack.
[73:17.86]Yeah, this is actually really bad.
[73:19.32]I have to kill the thing.
[73:20.92]I have to.
[73:22.56]Otherwise I'm fucked.
[73:27.84]Spell is ready.
[73:28.46]Blinding attack.
[73:29.12]We're gonna do that on... left.
[73:34.32]Gotcha.
[73:35.10]Now you're in trouble.
[73:40.04]No one's attacking yet.
[73:41.06]I'm good.
[73:45.70]Oh, this is bad.
[73:46.72]Um... I have to set up some poo defense.
[74:01.29]Uh-oh.
[74:05.13]This is a bad board.
[74:06.11]This is not a good board.
[74:09.93]Gaining mana for the most common tile.
[74:19.49]It's poo, but I... Right?
[74:21.05]How many... Is it boogers or poo?
[74:22.05]It's poo.
[74:22.45]I have to get rid of poo.
[74:36.37]Three, one.
[74:39.35]What about it?
[74:44.49]Fuck.
[74:46.69]Two, five, two, four.
[74:48.63]Two.
[74:49.83]One, two, three, four, five.
[74:51.67]Two, five, two, four.
[74:59.07]I know.
[74:59.49]I saw that too, but I think that screws up.
[75:01.43]I'll go for it, alright?
[75:04.89]But, uh...
[75:09.01]But I can't defend myself against these guys.
[75:19.35]Is it teeth now?
[75:25.10]It's poop.
[75:26.34]Fuck!
[75:34.34]How much damage is this gonna do?
[75:35.38]It can kill you.
[75:39.57]And then... I'm gonna have to take a hit.
[75:48.80]Goddammit, you guys just keep coming out of nowhere.
[76:02.32]This is kinda shit.
[76:09.22]Too much boogers and too much poo.
[76:12.12]Re-roll?
[76:12.62]I would love to, I can't.
[76:18.28]I think I'm dead here.
[76:28.31]That gave me a bunch of boogers.
[76:30.11]Which I don't even need.
[76:36.74]I think dead.
[76:39.60]I can put down a... No one's attacking yet, so that's good.
[76:45.34]Where am I going to put it, though?
[76:59.93]Over here?
[77:00.96]I'll put it right down below.
[77:06.47]Yeah.
[77:07.13]Alright.
[77:08.25]Come on, give me your worst.
[77:10.09]And then I can do... I can do an Ultra P. And then I can do a Super Booger.
[77:26.68]But where do I want that?
[77:27.86]On the right, I guess?
[77:31.43]I guess that prevents me from dying.
[77:34.45]Right now.
[77:37.97]I need more teeth.
[77:40.45]Alright, here, I'll just go like this.
[77:42.71]And I'm throwing this right down there.
[77:47.38]Okay.
[77:49.72]Gain extra damage for the room.
[77:53.30]Yeah.
[77:58.76]They keep spawning these things!
[78:00.12]Shit!
[78:04.08]I gotta kill these things!
[78:08.82]Ugh, I gotta get all the way to the back!
[78:10.67]Okay, new... Okay.
[78:22.20]It's gonna have to be Pooh Shield on the left.
[78:26.00]I need a 7-Bone Scenario.
[78:46.59]I gotta just try and kill one of these fucking guys.
[78:48.75]Can I get the bone?
[78:52.75]Can I set up a blinding attack?
[78:54.85]Wait, that's... Actually, I got extra damage for the whole floor.
[79:08.50]What was it?
[79:14.23]Teeth?
[79:14.93]Okay.
[79:16.33]I gotta set up a... what's it gonna go... I don't know, down here.
[79:21.15]Go... here... and then... Maybe I could go from... shit.
[79:37.12]That's all I can really do.
[79:39.10]Can I stop anything?
[79:40.56]I think that's all I got.
[79:44.94]Do a seven-poo scenario.
[79:48.00]We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[79:51.02]That's... That's way too much.
[79:52.72]That can take a million years.
[79:56.62]The two spread out.
[80:01.36]I could go down here, and then... What do you want me to be talking about?
[80:06.96]Set up the heart.
[80:07.92]That's a much better idea.
[80:11.59]I've set up the heart.
[80:13.25]Whatever else you guys want me to do.
[80:23.87]Disgusting.
[80:26.00]Now I can heal.
[80:26.80]Oh no, it's not three hearts!
[80:34.42]It's not three, it's four!
[80:36.50]Oh no!
[80:39.23]It's four hearts, like everything else.
[80:41.57]Oh no, that was a mistake.
[80:45.51]Shit, it's... I don't know why, I just thought it was three hearts, because they don't... It's alright, I'm fine.
[80:58.99]Oh, fucking Jesus Christ, they're just filling the board now.
[81:07.27]I'm about to take the- wait.
[81:16.17]If I go like this, then I can do a shield on the right.
[81:21.29]Hold on, let me see what I can do.
[81:22.89]That's all you get?
[81:26.50]What kind of fucking messed up world is that?
[81:28.24]It's only half a hearth.
[81:29.04]I gotta kill one of these things and I have Poo set up for next round.
[81:54.05]I think I may have fucked it.
[81:55.63]I think I spent... I did this too many times.
[81:57.91]It's not completely over.
[82:00.85]I can do two shields.
[82:04.47]I can go over here.
[82:05.31]No, no, no, no.
[82:07.01]I can go... I can do one shield.
[82:11.30]One and then... If I lacked your lich escape, 5,000 bits.
[82:19.05]Thanks for the 5,000 bits on top of your, like, 3 of 5,000 dollars you've given to this channel.
[82:29.21]You don't get to make fun of chat ever again because you're literally playing pee-pee poo-poo.
[82:40.43]Yes, I know.
[82:41.07]4, 7, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, left.
[82:48.55]What does that do?
[82:56.45]Thank you so much, Phylactery, though.
[82:57.70]Seriously.
[82:59.38]Two, two.
[83:00.62]Two, two.
[83:01.46]One, two.
[83:02.14]One, two.
[83:03.14]Two, two.
[83:03.62]Yeah, I know.
[83:07.52]But I don't know if that helps me.
[83:08.65]I'm just doing it.
[83:12.07]Let's move.
[83:12.35]At least I know I can do this.
[83:18.42]I can do that.
[83:18.74]Or that.
[83:19.00]Does that help me later?
[83:19.52]And it stops whatever's going on here.
[83:20.28]I need to set the bones up.
[83:36.92]Bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones...
[83:46.00]Something like that?
[83:56.00]Ah!
[83:59.79]Six bones only.
[84:03.09]No, I gotta free... Seven bones or bust.
[84:07.95]I'm just gonna do this.
[84:10.81]I don't know what everyone's gonna be like.
[84:13.36]Wait, what did you do?
[84:14.52]Alright, these guys are the worst.
[84:23.97]Okay, now...
[84:29.11]I could P... I could get P... And... Wait, is there a better P scenario there?
[84:38.30]Maybe.
[84:39.68]If I go over and then down, that'll give me more turns to then... I don't fucking know.
[84:50.42]And then I... Um... Maybe I could do bonds... Um...
[85:04.58]Seven bone scenario.
[85:06.26]You know what?
[85:06.66]It's actually kind of funny you're saying that, but I think I lose.
[85:12.06]I needed to kill these things fast.
[85:13.34]I just didn't know what they did.
[85:14.94]I was too focused on the toilet paper guys when I should have killed these guys immediately.
[85:20.48]I need the mana for the bones.
[85:21.56]Yeah, I know.
[85:25.08]I'm just going to go like this.
[85:34.95]And then I'm gonna kill one on the right.
[85:39.17]And then I'm gonna end my turn again.
[85:41.64]I can't do anything.
[85:43.68]Thankfully no one's attacking right now, so... Alright.
[85:54.24]Hold on a minute.
[85:56.44]I can... I can... I need bones.
[86:17.27]Well, if I blinding attack, will it kill it through here?
[86:20.27]Oh, is it gonna... Are we certain about that, or is it gonna block it?
[86:33.72]What the fuck just happened?!
[86:37.72]It attacked me?! !
[86:41.80]Why?
[86:42.28]Oh, now I really am dead.
[86:44.75]Uh-oh.
[86:50.67]Can I keep... I can at least keep this going for another... Who's... I'm gonna freeze you.
[87:00.93]And then... Nobody's attacking, right?
[87:06.78]Oh, you asshole.
[87:07.68]Right in the middle.
[87:08.76]Bones!
[87:09.12]I need bones.
[87:14.49]This is taking so much longer than it should.
[87:17.29]I could go like this, and then... I need to block this guy!
[87:21.93]I die if I don't block that guy!
[87:30.86]Oh, it's over.
[87:42.95]You know what the real culprit was?
[87:44.41]This guy right here.
[87:51.41]Hmmm.
[87:54.41]I'm dead.
[88:02.70]Holy shit.
[88:04.08]I'm alive.
[88:08.10]Uhh.
[88:19.07]I could kill them both, but then that just- I'm just like treading water perpetually.
[88:29.21]Easy seven bones.
[88:30.35]No, it's not.
[88:31.37]It's gonna take like two turns.
[88:37.14]I could do five bone in two turns, but that- does that help me?
[88:41.18]I'm talking about like you go one, bang, and there's five there.
[88:45.20]Or I could go...
[88:56.03]You're dead in one hit.
[88:56.99]I know, that's why I can't... I have to kill these two on the sides.
[89:01.35]If I don't kill these two on the sides, I have to make a... I'm just dead.
[89:04.39]So that's what has to happen.
[89:18.49]So now, set up the five bone scenario.
[89:26.93]wait one two three I got a six bone scenario six bone scenario coming up
[89:53.12]If you can do it, you can survive these two and set up for the next.
[89:56.30]I'm about to die right now!
[89:57.82]No, if I do seven bones, this thing's gonna activate and it's gonna kill me!
[90:08.94]It's gonna kill me!
[90:11.57]Booger mid!
[90:16.71]No, I'm gonna do six bones scenario.
[90:24.34]Okay.
[90:25.32]Bang.
[90:27.68]Bang.
[90:29.35]Alright.
[90:30.23]And then we're gonna- I'm clearing it.
[90:32.29]And then we're gonna kill this guy on the left.
[90:37.23]And then!
[90:38.38]And only then!
[90:39.14]What do you mean why?
[90:43.66]If this thing takes damage, I die!
[90:47.08]What happened?
[91:12.89]I can't attack these guys!
[91:15.61]I can't attack them!
[91:21.26]Give me some- ooh, wait!
[91:38.59]I can do six.
[91:39.83]I could do seven actually, no I couldn't.
[91:41.53]Yes I can.
[91:43.39]What does Sevenpoo do?
[91:44.57]Have we even seen it yet?
[91:45.31]No, we don't know what it does.
[91:48.32]I'm doing it.
[92:05.92]What does it do?
[92:19.74]Okay, that's pretty great, actually.
[92:21.72]That's really good.
[92:24.40]Uh, okay.
[92:25.10]I think I'm okay for a while.
[92:31.93]But god damn it, these clouds!
[92:34.77]Alright.
[92:36.71]I need bones.
[92:38.39]I'm just building bones.
[92:39.39]That's all I care about.
[92:44.47]If I go this way...
[92:47.20]This way.
[92:49.06]And then down.
[92:50.44]I'm just doing bones only.
[92:55.12]What did that just do?
[93:00.46]Bones only.
[93:01.14]Blinding attack.
[93:09.78]I have some.
[93:10.28]I'm not using it yet, though.
[93:24.16]Gain?
[93:24.58]Why would I press this?
[93:25.68]Stop telling me to do that.
[93:31.74]And then gum up the... booger.
[93:35.91]I know, I'm gonna do it.
[93:40.49]Let's see, what do I got?
[93:41.35]I could do this booger here, and then who should I gum up?
[93:45.59]On the left?
[93:46.02]That's what I'm probably gonna do.
[93:55.08]And then I need these blinding attacks.
[93:57.48]It's so bad.
[93:59.62]Alright, can I throw a tooth?
[94:18.47]I have seven bone mana?
[94:19.73]Yeah, I need eight.
[94:21.33]I don't want to use them because they're just gonna keep spawning them.
[94:24.77]Yeah, I have to clear these and then kill that before the other cloud there.
[94:27.86]I have shield.
[94:36.38]I have time.
[94:36.82]Yeah, I'm alright.
[94:37.92]I just want to... I guess I could bring this down and bring the bone over.
[94:51.06]I could do this.
[94:56.32]No, I could do this.
[94:57.62]And then... No... The teeth.
[95:07.45]Half-Life VR game announced on Valve's Twitter?

[95:23.45]Half-Life VR.
[95:31.07]Oh, that's fucking cool.
[95:33.85]We'll see, though.
[95:34.37]I'm gonna hold off judgment, because here's the thing about VR games.
[95:38.66]This, if, okay.
[95:40.30]If this is like a 2 hour and 25 minute devalved tech demo, then I don't care.
[95:44.80]We'll find out.
[95:51.57]If this is the real deal, I'm in.
[95:54.48]If this is like a 48 minute long demo for their new controllers, then I'm not in.
[96:02.52]Speaking of being in, um... Why is he still on this level?
[96:09.00]Because, uh, it's kind of hard.
[96:10.69]And these guys are... They spawn... You can't hurt these guys.
[96:14.51]It's pretty... It's cool.
[96:15.45]It's a fun game.
[96:16.17]He's trying to challenge, trying to get through the fucking hard levels.
[96:19.45]Alright.
[96:21.42]I'm setting up Bones only.
[96:24.36]And I know people are going to be like, what are you doing?
[96:26.77]Oh my, I can't believe he just did that.
[96:37.41]Dude, I can't even watch this stream because of him.
[96:43.69]Bones.
[96:45.39]I'm going to the right side.
[96:51.20]Okay.
[96:52.14]Drop that stupid gas thing!
[96:58.59]What's the better play?
[96:59.27]This?
[97:01.59]Or this?
[97:02.88]Probably that.
[97:06.26]I'm gonna move this guy, set up a 5-poo scenario maybe?
[97:15.65]The poo protects from- wait, what are you saying?
[97:18.49]The poo protects the clouds.
[97:19.69]If this is not real, I'm gonna be very mad at you.
[97:26.77]You guys are so fucked, thank you.
[97:28.06]I appreciate it.
[97:29.52]Now this game- this level just got five times easier.
[97:37.30]So now I can do this two more times.
[97:39.20]I'm gonna- I can go bang bang.
[97:42.77]No, it's not finally we can end this.
[97:44.35]We're not even close.
[97:45.83]We're not even remotely close yet.
[97:51.52]If only it didn't take you 25 minutes to read that.
[97:53.38]I've only been on this level for like 18 minutes.
[97:55.12]So, like, pump the brakes a little.
[97:58.46]Screech on the brakes.
[97:59.48]I haven't even been 25 minutes.
[98:02.31]I've only been like 17 or 18.
[98:03.51]Alright, let's go.
[98:08.35]Go for the health.
[98:09.05]That's a good idea.
[98:10.15]But I don't have any more health.
[98:15.23]No, I'm set.
[98:15.99]Look.
[98:17.05]You know what?
[98:18.73]No.
[98:19.43]Okay.
[98:21.69]Go for a heart match.
[98:22.57]I need four hearts and there's no hearts coming down on the menu.
[98:25.62]I'm setting up the shit.

[102:31.09]Okay.
[102:36.05]That's cool.
[102:38.61]Alright, add three wild tiles.

[102:43.23]So we need bones and...
[102:49.80]I mean, that's pretty awesome.
[102:50.64]Poo and goo.
[102:51.57]Let me see.
[102:57.53]How do I set up a good poo and goo scenario?
[103:02.97]Um... What does this do?
[103:04.87]What's the icon on the head for?
[103:11.78]You don't like the music?
[103:12.52]Oh, there's no options.
[103:18.98]There, I'll turn it down.
[103:24.35]Alright, uh, I can go, I can do a tooth.
[103:27.71]Should I just try to kill this thing right now?
[103:29.27]I wonder how much, let me see.
[103:36.99]I'm just gonna hit this thing, I don't know what it does.
[103:40.93]I guess, it's just dead, I guess.
[103:43.21]Oh, fuck, it's one of those things!
[103:47.32]Uh, poo right down the middle.
[103:49.26]I need poo and I need goo.
[103:52.27]Although, I could do five.
[103:54.90]Alright, hold on.
[103:56.30]Hear me out on this.
[103:57.94]I could do five.
[104:02.87]Damn it.
[104:03.41]No.
[104:05.89]Just mute and play better music.
[104:07.35]You really don't like it that much, huh?
[104:22.48]Now, if I go like this, and then I go like this, I don't do that.
[104:35.37]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[104:39.35]If I go down with this, I get another move, though.
[104:46.14]Oh, no!
[104:47.00]I knew that was gonna happen.
[104:48.22]Why did I do that?
[104:49.92]I knew that was gonna fucking happen.
[104:52.26]I... Did you see how I stopped and I was like, no, wait.
[104:56.20]I... Why did I do that?
[104:57.35]I knew that was gonna happen.
[104:58.25]I got a double thing.
[104:59.27]Oh, fuck.
[105:01.93]Shit.
[105:02.91]That's... I knew that was gonna happen.
[105:07.37]Fuck.

[105:11.19]Yeah, I fucked it up.
[105:14.35]Well...
[105:18.08]I got... Oh, this is where it gets fucking hairy.
[105:29.79]Like, really hairy.
[105:43.34]I don't think I can do seven bones.
[105:44.50]I think I'm dead before I do it.
[105:51.51]I could set up a... I could set it up, but... Seven bones next turn.
[105:58.97]What are you saying?
[105:59.67]Like, down here.
[106:01.59]Down here.
[106:02.25]Because that'll be six, and then I could drag... Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[106:11.81]I might die.
[106:12.49]Let's see if I die.
[106:17.73]So hearts are first, right?
[106:19.61]Alright, this is... I win.
[106:36.54]No, I didn't.
[106:38.26]Wait.
[106:38.48]Uh, what do I have?
[106:42.08]Nine?
[106:43.86]Should I just add... No, should I gum him up?
[106:50.91]I gotta be careful about this guy.
[107:00.48]And then... Wait.
[107:01.52]Wait.
[107:06.47]Oh my, oh my, wait, wait, I don't know what I'm doing.
[107:08.97]What am I doing?
[107:14.60]Holy shit, okay.
[107:16.28]Um, over here?
[107:17.50]And... Then... You?
[107:25.80]Then... Here.
[107:27.88]Then... Throw.
[107:30.27]Then...
[107:34.59]Oh, man, we got more wild tiles.
[107:36.69]Can I keep this?
[107:39.39]There's too many flashing, like, Super Mario stars.
[107:42.15]Um, I want that heart.
[107:50.96]I want a super heart.
[107:52.05]No, I don't.
[107:52.47]I just want one heart.
[107:56.24]I could do a big turn.
[107:57.64]Hold on.
[107:58.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[107:58.60]I could do... I don't know.
[108:00.90]This is a lot to do here.
[108:03.00]I could do a big, huge, super go more.
[108:10.83]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[108:12.01]Why did it not activate immediately?
[108:18.39]There it is.
[108:18.75]Alright, full health.
[108:23.57]Now I just need to do... I just win.
[108:26.60]Yeah, that's it.
[108:29.66]I don't... Yeah, I did.
[108:47.53]Mega battery.
[108:48.67]Plus three movement, plus random mana.
[108:50.81]This doesn't matter anyways.
[108:52.61]It's gonna be fucking rainbowed anyways.
[108:59.50]Plus three movement and random mana.
[109:00.74]I mean, what?
[109:01.88]Doesn't matter.
[109:05.69]Bumbo versus Dusk.
[109:11.57]Alright, time to reload everything I've known about my whole build.
[109:18.00]Movement gaining attack.
[109:19.64]Destroy all tiles of one type.
[109:21.30]Blocks the next single attack.
[109:23.52]Charges random usable item.
[109:25.70]Hits the furthest enemy plus splash.
[109:30.80]Okay.
[109:33.04]Plus three movement and random mana.
[109:35.12]Should I do it right off the bat?
[109:36.10]Go for it right off the bat.
[109:38.22]Let's go.
[109:40.07]How much mana?
[109:41.27]Alright, I got a seven-bone scenario I can do now.
[109:43.99]I got one, two, three, four, five moves.
[109:50.01]One.
[109:50.87]One, two, three, four, five.
[109:52.03]There's seven bones on the board.
[109:53.34]How do we get the seven bones to make a seven-bone scenario?
[109:56.98]I don't want to mess this up.
[110:03.24]No, it's possible.
[110:03.88]It is.
[110:06.14]It'll be possible next turn.
[110:08.95]If I go over, over down, that's three, which then has this row.
[110:15.35]No.
[110:17.09]Three.
[110:18.39]Okay.
[110:19.23]Hold on.
[110:23.77]I hope I'm doing this right.
[110:27.72]Okay, then this one comes up.
[110:34.56]And then... No, no, no, no, no!
[110:38.38]Three, this, no, this goes down, right?
[110:40.50]Okay, this comes down.
[110:42.44]Then this goes over.
[110:46.82]What?
[110:47.78]No, that was right.
[110:49.70]Because I have to move this one over.
[110:52.65]That's too many moves.
[110:54.51]Use one, just... All to the top row?
[110:58.37]What do you mean all to the top row?
[111:00.39]What do you mean?
[111:01.33]Do it on the top row?
[111:06.81]No.
[111:08.87]Should I?
[111:10.06]So, like this?
[111:11.94]And then... Alright!
[111:20.65]Let's go!
[111:21.31]Uh-oh!
[111:23.17]Okay, he doesn't... He just hits you.
[111:26.01]Seven bone scenario... I almost just double-clicked!
[111:27.75]Okay, seven bone scenario.
[111:29.39]Light him up.
[111:38.40]And with his final bit of punch, Bumbo smashes Big Bad Guy in the back.
[112:09.87]What's in there, Bumble?
[112:35.32]This is the fat Bumbo.
[112:43.63]You unlocked Bumbo the Stout.
[112:50.02]And Halls of Belial have unlocked.
[112:58.77]What's your thing?
[113:05.41]Whoa, this game sucks ass.
[113:07.65]What?
[113:07.85]What are you talking about?
[113:08.93]This game's like coal.
[113:17.56]I like this.
[113:18.20]This is fun.
[113:19.76]This is an iPad game.
[113:20.92]This is not an iPad game.
[113:27.39]Ban them.
[113:28.77]Alright, so this is Bumble the Stout.
[113:30.51]Stick.
[113:31.57]Stick.
[113:33.08]Whack away.
[113:34.54]That's three poops.
[113:35.28]That's a blender blade?
[113:37.18]Destroys tiles and touching tiles.
[113:42.44]Kind of a shitty stat setup, though.
[113:46.30]Terrible in everything.
[113:49.93]So far, Bumble... Bumble's the best.
[113:52.07]Bumble the Brave.
[114:03.18]Let's try the new one.
[114:10.71]Yeah, you gotta play with them to unlock the next floor anyways, yeah.
[114:19.60]Okay, so I have whack away, so might as well just load up poops, huh?
[114:31.93]I mean, I could just do this now.
[114:33.00]Or I could load up a big one.
[114:36.68]Yeah, fuck it.
[114:37.18]Let's just do this.
[114:40.42]Mana drain?
[114:45.69]Yeah, fuck it.
[114:46.23]Watch this.
[114:56.77]Whack away.
[114:57.15]It's two damage.
[115:12.00]Best character in the game.
[115:17.77]Let's throw a bone.
[115:21.15]Actually, I'm gonna get hit.
[115:23.93]No, I'm not.
[115:24.39]Yes, I am.
[115:27.09]Should've killed this guy.
[115:28.25]I'm fucking dumb.
[115:30.70]It's alright.
[115:31.12]I'm a little dumb, but whatever.
[115:46.48]Destroys tiles and... See, this is... I need to use this to see how that works.
[115:49.82]Okay.
[115:55.86]There's a bone over here.
[115:56.80]And then... Who cares, right?
[116:20.08]You lose mana every turn.
[116:22.52]That's alright.
[116:24.82]Brown belt.
[116:25.56]Blocks next attack plus attacks.
[116:29.51]Or chaos.
[116:30.65]Add wild tile and a curse.
[116:38.87]I'm not sure what a curse does.
[116:40.79]But one wild tile for two teeth is kind of cool.
[116:45.01]I'm going for it.
[116:51.57]alright let's do this poop in the way just kill you I got out of wild oh that's
[117:20.45]Alright, sorry.
[117:20.89]I just choked on air.
[117:21.97]That was ridiculous.
[117:23.01]I'm sorry.
[117:23.57]I tried to mute as fast as I could.
[117:24.67]Alright, I got a wild tile here.
[117:26.59]We can gum up the mill.
[117:28.49]It's gonna happen again.
[117:29.53]Maybe I should do bones.
[117:33.05]Do it again.
[117:39.74]Alright, I gotta stop fucking around.
[117:42.60]Alright, don't fuck around.
[117:51.70]I mean, I know I could have used it again, but... Curse insta-kills enemies.
[117:57.01]What?
[117:58.83]Why would that be a downside?
[118:00.17]Alright, I've got wilds here.
[118:03.64]I could go here.
[118:06.42]I could start to build out a... Big bone.
[118:12.17]Which would probably be better this way, actually.
[118:18.57]No, it's gonna take too long.
[118:20.33]Uh, I'm just gonna do, what's it gonna do over here?
[118:21.98]I'm just gonna throw a bone.
[118:29.14]Mmm, right in the middle.
[118:32.92]And then, I'm gonna move this, out here.
[118:38.77]And, so if I block that, this is their shit, not mine, right?
[118:49.52]So I have to block it with my own shit.
[118:59.47]Okay, I'm safe.
[119:05.61]Alright, uh, I could do... Let's do... Should I do gum?
[119:15.07]I need to do poops.
[119:17.23]But let's just gum... Let's just gum this.
[119:21.17]Because I wanted to get rid of it.
[119:23.70]Destroy tiles and touch... I kind of want to know what this does.
[119:29.50]Take an area to destroy.
[119:31.00]I just want to know what it does.
[119:34.52]Okay, so it just destroys all the tiles touching that one.
[119:39.26]I should have destroyed the curse.
[119:42.84]Yeah, that would have been a smart idea.
[119:44.40]But I would have gotten rid of the bones.
[119:50.27]Alright, let's set up a... break this down.
[119:54.29]Hmm...
[120:18.69]I could kill this, but I'm gonna take a hit.
[120:30.29]What's gonna do more damage?
[120:32.49]Probably this.
[120:42.65]And then I just gotta throw a tooth at you, if I can make it work.
[120:53.93]I don't really have any great setup here.
[120:57.39]I could go up and then over.
[121:00.89]And then heal?
[121:01.51]Not a heal, uh... Booger.
[121:14.91]Down and then right.
[121:16.23]Good booger.
[121:16.81]I'm just gonna do it.
[121:21.29]Probably fucking this whole thing up, but whatever.
[121:29.51]Let's get rid of the curse.
[121:32.59]And then... I don't know, let's go.
[121:41.68]And then, uh... That was kind of fun to do that, because now I do this.
[121:52.83]It's only one damage!
[121:54.29]Oh, fuck.
[122:11.08]God.
[122:22.63]Keep it going.
[122:25.79]He's in front of the poop, isn't he?
[122:26.79]Alright, poop on the left, kill thing in the middle.
[122:45.47]This is two damage, though, isn't it?
[122:48.65]See you later.
[122:57.38]And now, I could just nonchalantly throw a tooth at you.
[123:09.87]And then, let's get a wild in there.
[123:13.21]Do another one.
[123:14.45]Another one.
[123:19.44]Good.
[123:20.30]Now, I mean, it's impossible for me not to get something here.
[123:24.92]So, wild.
[123:26.84]Oh.
[123:28.21]It doesn't matter.
[123:31.91]I mean, I could have done something fun.
[123:32.99]I mean, that's cool.
[123:33.79]Pretty cool.
[123:39.78]Doesn't matter the play there.
[123:40.72]You just gotta kill it.
[123:41.42]Ooh.
[123:44.38]Ooh.
[123:46.72]Plus one damage this turn.
[123:48.59]It's only 2P.
[123:51.61]But of this turn only.
[123:54.69]Or plus one damage and life gain.
[123:57.48]It takes three rooms to charge.
[124:04.32]Which drug do I want?
[124:05.42]That's a good question.
[124:12.62]I mean, is this permanent?
[124:13.86]If it's permanent, then just use it every single second to get it.
[124:16.32]Or this is just, you can... Yeah.
[124:19.57]Yeah, that's probably better.
[124:22.53]Peeper!
[124:23.15]I remember Peeper.
[124:25.81]I have ADHD.
[124:26.77]Get the ADDY.
[124:28.47]Okay, I see what you're doing there.
[124:31.75]Alright, so... Should I do a huge poop here?
[124:37.58]I could do...
[124:41.96]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[124:48.88]Nah, I could do five.
[124:49.98]I'm still, I'm gonna do it.
[125:02.01]Ah, fuck it, I'm just gonna do five.
[125:08.96]Not like it matters.
[125:09.46]I'm just gonna do her in the middle anyways.
[125:11.24]Uh, wait, um, is it possible?
[125:12.90]No.
[125:13.26]Whatever, just do it.
[125:15.32]Could I have done six?
[125:20.59]I got a bone, too.
[125:21.25]Oh, move it out of the way.
[125:25.49]I'm not gonna use this because it's not gonna hurt him.
[125:28.13]But let's, uh, I can do another turn.
[125:37.53]Can I hit him with something?
[125:40.11]Hold on.
[125:40.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[125:40.75]I'm going to slow down.
[125:45.71]Hold on.
[125:46.11]Wait, wait, wait.
[125:46.61]Hold on.
[125:47.09]Slow down.
[125:50.39]Hold on.
[125:50.83]Wait.
[125:51.39]Can I kill him?
[125:53.55]Plus one.
[125:54.33]I can do this two, four.
[125:55.19]I can do plus three damage.
[126:00.91]For this turn.
[126:01.73]Hold on.
[126:03.19]I can do this twice, so I can hit him for...
[126:07.05]What?
[126:07.27]Like, I can do a shitload of damage right now.
[126:11.17]The teeth.
[126:12.81]Hit him with the teeth.
[126:18.92]Oh yeah.
[126:24.08]Alright buddy, it's time for you to take an absolute shitload of damage.
[126:35.92]That's 510 damage.
[126:39.12]That feels pretty good.
[126:44.36]Let's add a wild, too.
[126:47.57]You know what, fuck it.
[126:48.33]Let's just fill the board with wilds.
[126:49.61]Okay, looking for shit here.
[127:03.45]Shit and piss.
[127:07.16]I could just kill him, I think.
[127:08.48]Can I?
[127:11.06]There's a lot of different wild scenarios here.
[127:16.30]I think I can kill him.
[127:17.42]If I just do poo.
[127:19.34]So hold on.
[127:20.22]Get this over here.
[127:25.98]That's poo?
[127:27.17]Hold on.
[127:32.19]Because that's one, two, three, four.
[127:35.40]It's not enough.
[127:37.18]No, I'll bring that back.
[127:39.52]I could go this way.
[127:40.58]Shit.
[127:44.37]That's a lot to look at.
[127:45.35]I'm just going to do it.
[127:50.23]Yeah, I'm just going to go for it.
[127:57.09]So, let's move this, just, I'm just gonna just connect it.
[128:01.01]I got plenty more wiles and shit too, so who cares.
[128:04.59]So, I'm just gonna cover up you, and then I'm gonna hit you in the face.
[128:19.06]Cursed.
[128:21.56]How did I get cursed?
[128:23.40]Oh, fuck, that's how.
[128:24.50]Alright, let's just kill him.
[128:30.75]Can I kill him right now?
[128:32.49]I just need poop.
[128:37.56]I could do four bones on the left.
[128:38.94]Yeah, there it is.
[128:42.54]Goodbye.
[128:46.02]Nice.
[128:48.50]If you match seven curse, you instantly die.
[128:50.56]That's not good.
[128:52.68]Rat heart.
[128:53.61]May gain soul hearts or modeling clay.
[128:56.17]Copy a trinket.
[129:03.59]May gain soul heart.
[129:07.43]Or I can copy one of my trinkets.
[129:08.92]What do I have for a trinket right now?
[129:17.00]What's the scenario how this plays out, though?
[129:18.58]Is it just in the beginning of a room?
[129:19.90]Let's try it, see what happens.
[129:27.98]Alright.
[129:30.60]Spells hurt more, spells cost less, or reroll spell cost.
[129:37.99]Spin the wheel.
[129:40.39]Spin the fucking wheel.
[129:44.77]Spells hurt more is absolute- I'm taking that.
[129:48.47]Pick a spell to modify.
[129:50.23]Um, this one.
[129:53.31]Does three damage now.
[129:54.87]Okay, that's pretty fucking good.
[129:56.63]Spells cost less.
[129:57.95]I'm gonna do it to that as well.
[130:01.06]Check this shit out.
[130:02.00]Ready?
[130:02.76]This thing is going to be two.
[130:04.98]It's only two.
[130:14.28]I can either spin the wheel or I can buy a heart.
[130:30.74]Sat.
[130:35.34]Yeah.
[130:39.68]Yep, let's take a look at that.
[130:40.88]That's gonna be fu- I mean... I'm gonna be- I'm gonna wipe everybody out.
[130:45.70]If I just only need to focus on... just... match poos, and I have a 4 damage spell that I can use as many times as I want.
[130:55.99]Poo Wizard.
[130:57.51]Let's go.
[131:09.78]Four damage for two poops.
[131:12.12]Holy shit, that's ridiculous.
[131:16.02]I can kill two things right now.
[131:24.27]Let's go right down the middle.
[131:25.43]Yeah, I'll put this over here.
[131:29.35]Let's take a look at our new move.
[131:32.33]Bang.
[131:33.89]Huh?
[131:33.99]Huh?
[131:41.81]Spell resisted.
[131:42.73]I can't kill those.
[131:48.65]No.
[131:49.13]You can't do spells against these stone mushrooms.
[131:51.54]That's what that icon means.
[131:58.88]This is the room that I get right after getting my awesome new build.
[132:08.69]That sucks.
[132:12.30]This is horrible.
[132:14.16]I have to... Okay, we get bones.
[132:16.14]I would have put the poo here if I had even remotely had thought this was a possibility.
[132:21.63]Um... Wait.
[132:29.39]Okay, so I go... This is one damage.
[132:33.75]I could kill one of these.
[132:34.75]Oh, fuck.
[132:41.38]How many bones can I throw?
[132:43.86]One.
[132:44.44]No matter the scenario.
[132:46.40]I mean, I think it's time to set up a potential ridiculous scenario.
[132:52.93]No.
[132:58.97]I'm only going to be able to throw one bone.
[133:02.54]How long is this going to take me to do?
[133:03.72]I'll take one... I'll take... I'll have one heart left.
[133:08.20]Which would be... Then I... Next round I can do three?
[133:10.58]Three.
[133:11.88]Fuck it, let's do it.
[133:13.28]Who cares?
[133:13.86]You know what I'm saying?
[133:23.13]Alright.
[133:24.91]Alright, alright.
[133:26.65]Let's go.
[133:27.45]See you later.
[133:34.35]Hopefully this kills the thing in the back.
[133:35.81]Or at least... Hopefully this does enough damage.
[133:38.18]Get down the front.
[133:41.10]Oh, yes.
[133:44.06]That was a really bad room for what I just built.
[133:49.22]Splash damage attack?
[133:53.35]So, wait.
[133:54.67]Could I activate the addy... Like, three times.
[134:00.85]Activate splash damage attack and then use my stick.
[134:11.56]It's sick, but I mean, that's kind of... that's too pricey.
[134:14.60]Is it, though?
[134:16.96]If we're going Glass Cannon, I might as well stuff it.
[134:20.24]Too expensive.
[134:21.26]50% of blind... but that's a... This is four, this one's six.
[134:25.05]50% chance of not blinding an enemy.
[134:27.75]For four bones?
[134:37.91]You start from zero at every turn.
[134:39.96]Shit, that's right.
[134:41.88]Yeah, that's right.
[134:42.78]That's true.
[134:46.76]Alright.
[134:47.62]What do we got?
[134:51.93]Let's see.
[134:52.51]What do I want to do here?
[134:53.53]Start.
[135:05.40]Let's put down some shit.
[135:09.67]I'm gonna go right down the middle.
[135:11.41]And then we're gonna kill the shit on... Oh man, this is so fantastic.
[135:14.21]Look at this.
[135:17.28]That did 8 damage.
[135:19.54]But what's the most... What's the most threatening thing here?
[135:22.04]I need to know.
[135:26.68]I want... Is the other thing... We're going in the back.
[135:30.67]Yeah, I don't even know what these things do, but I don't want to know.
[135:43.11]Okay.
[135:45.56]I can throw a tooth.
[135:46.62]I can throw a bone.
[135:47.34]I need more poos.
[135:51.68]Get some piss.
[135:53.86]Yeah, let's do piss.
[135:56.04]Bring down the goo.
[135:58.75]Hold on.
[135:59.13]Wait.
[135:59.41]Hold on a second.
[136:01.03]Two, four.
[136:01.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[136:03.73]Bone.
[136:04.83]Bone.
[136:05.37]Damage.
[136:06.13]Bingo.
[136:06.41]Alright, yeah.
[136:09.96]That's a good exploit because then I can throw this once and it'll kill it.
[136:16.33]Six teeth.
[136:20.31]I'm just gonna do the safe bone play.
[136:24.47]So this is... Two, four, six.
[136:27.15]Two.
[136:28.01]Four.
[136:28.75]Six.
[136:30.63]Bang.
[136:31.07]Let's throw this, kill this thing right off the bat.
[136:35.46]Game sucks.
[136:38.10]Blind enemies!
[136:39.34]Yeah!
[136:46.10]This is actually really cool.
[136:50.20]Alright, so we're going to attack.
[136:51.31]It's going to hit there.
[136:53.29]I don't have any shits to line up, but I could throw a tooth, which will give me some wilds.
[137:00.33]Actually, I could throw more than one tooth, is the question.
[137:04.85]Nah.
[137:05.81]I could do... I could do this.
[137:14.05]Okay, hold on do this Yep I'm getting alright I'm getting a little fucking you guys didn't think I was gonna get up twice
[137:44.30]Alright, slow down.
[137:45.34]No more.
[137:46.64]Okay.
[137:47.10]Okay.
[137:47.50]Done.
[137:53.48]Uh.
[138:01.53]Um.
[138:03.37]What do I do about this?
[138:04.33]I can do down.
[138:07.89]Gum.
[138:08.61]Booger.
[138:09.07]And then.
[138:12.03]Booger.
[138:12.33]We're gonna break the tiles here.
[138:16.61]Right here.
[138:17.01]Okay.
[138:21.37]Then we're gonna go right here.
[138:23.41]What was the fight?
[138:37.84]Very cool.
[138:39.58]Dammit, bad room.
[138:42.81]Absolutely terrible room.
[138:44.07]Did they know what build I just made?
[138:45.81]What the hell?
[138:59.46]I might have to try to do seven here.
[139:04.02]If I go all the way back here, like here, I could do three.
[139:08.04]No, it's not gonna work.
[139:12.37]Maybe this way?
[139:13.39]No.
[139:14.47]Maybe this way?
[139:15.09]No.
[139:15.15]I could do six.
[139:23.60]Is that gonna take too long?
[139:29.76]That shit's gonna take too long.
[139:31.74]You can do seven in two turns.
[139:39.29]Can I though?
[139:40.99]Seven bones?
[139:41.79]That's not possible.
[139:45.99]If I go, I could do four poos and one pee.
[139:52.88]Where do you see that?
[139:56.88]Wait, hold on.
[140:00.87]That's not terrible.
[140:09.55]Let's go right here.
[140:12.31]Just do it for fun, because we want to.
[140:19.42]Now I got a P set up.
[140:20.94]I can't do this anyway, so that's... Yeah, no, I do have a pretty good P set up here, but P... I don't think P's that very good for 7.
[140:27.94]You only get, what, 5?
[140:28.48]Maybe not, I don't know.
[140:29.36]We'll see.
[140:31.12]I might be in some trouble here, though.
[140:37.33]Because if I go...
[140:41.73]There's a free teeth column on the right.
[140:47.68]What do you mean?
[140:54.04]I could set up P. If I do this, bring two down, and then... I mean, that's six.
[141:04.62]I'm just gonna go for that.
[141:07.66]Knockback right?
[141:12.56]Wait, wait, wait.
[141:12.94]What do you mean knockback?
[141:14.12]Teeth, Jeremy.
[141:14.74]Teeth, Jeremy.
[141:15.36]Teeth.
[141:18.30]I'm not seeing this.
[141:19.72]Teeth?
[141:20.10]I can do four on one move?
[141:23.18]Why am I not seeing this?
[141:24.80]Second.
[141:26.00]Two, three.
[141:26.62]Three, one.
[141:27.36]Four, two.
[141:29.64]Do seven teeth.
[141:32.58]I... Okay, I see you.
[141:34.74]I see what you're saying.
[141:42.73]Fuck.
[141:43.25]Okay.
[141:44.25]17th.
[141:44.53]What does it do?
[141:45.01]I can't do it this round.
[141:49.02]I have to take a hit?
[141:56.22]Am I safe?
[141:59.57]Oh, that's right.
[141:59.99]I have to poo there.
[142:00.53]Okay.
[142:01.53]You're right.
[142:01.81]That's true.
[142:04.35]I forgot about it.
[142:05.73]Alright.
[142:06.01]I hope this works.
[142:06.67]Otherwise, the run's over.
[142:12.69]Thank god.
[142:20.00]Destroy a column of tiles.
[142:23.14]I have too many bones.
[142:24.30]Too many things that require bones.
[142:25.36]Uh, copies spell at random.
[142:27.10]Let's take that.
[142:36.07]Bumbo versus Shy Gal.
[142:38.09]Unmask and smash.
[142:42.86]New... New boss.
[142:47.46]Copy spell at random.
[142:48.68]Should I just do it?
[142:50.64]What am I gonna do?
[142:51.24]Just not do it?
[142:51.86]Just do it right now.
[142:52.56]Whatever it is.
[142:53.10]What if it's a bone?
[142:54.06]What if it's a seven bone?
[142:57.32]It might be.
[143:03.33]Oh, shit.
[143:03.89]It's a throwable stick.
[143:10.74]Unmasked.
[143:13.62]Alright, hold on.
[143:14.52]Now, um... I can do poop right now.
[143:24.99]Let's put it right in the middle.
[143:27.55]Whack.
[143:31.01]Can I kill you right now?
[143:32.73]I just won.
[143:41.54]Yes!
[143:41.94]This is an insane build.
[143:46.33]It really is really good.
[143:47.51]I might get screwed later though.
[143:48.79]Free spell at low HP.
[143:52.55]May add poison to attacks.
[143:56.75]What is low HP?
[144:00.86]What would that be considered low?
[144:02.70]Half a heart?
[144:04.56]Or what I have right now?
[144:07.62]Probably half a heart.
[144:11.28]It may add poison, not will add poison.
[144:16.12]It may add poison.
[144:17.44]What's that percentage, though?
[144:25.16]I want the free spell.
[144:28.88]Alright, 21 coins.
[144:29.80]What do we got over here?
[144:32.94]Spell costs less.
[144:33.93]Ugh.
[144:44.23]Oh, I can't break it.
[144:46.11]I can't break the game.
[144:47.49]Cancel.
[144:47.97]Too bad.
[144:51.75]Cancel.
[144:55.99]Well, let's at least take a heart.
[145:00.83]Spin the wheel.
[145:02.65]Wait.
[145:04.28]Spell cost less.
[145:05.26]Reroll spell cost.
[145:06.70]What does spell charge last?
[145:08.08]Okay, I see what that means.
[145:11.65]Copy to spell it.
[145:13.29]I see.
[145:13.57]It'll bring it down to one room.
[145:17.52]That might not be a horrible thing to do.
[145:18.98]I mean, there's a wheel, so obviously everyone wants me to spin the wheel.
[145:28.84]I'll have enough to do one more thing.
[145:36.80]That's absolutely incredible.
[145:41.05]33% more health, and we'll do this.
[145:43.99]Wait.
[145:47.57]Spelt.
[145:48.17]Rerail spelt.
[145:48.85]No.
[145:49.95]We have to get the... Open the box.
[145:54.49]Granny teeth?
[146:01.68]Got it.
[146:08.29]And I have one more coin, which... that doesn't look right.
[146:14.26]The Halls of Belial!
[146:15.82]I haven't been here before.
[146:22.09]This is a new content.
[146:23.07]But what do these do?
[146:26.29]Can I look at it?
[146:26.79]Is there any way to see what this does?
[146:36.80]You just get one tooth.
[146:38.44]Oh.
[146:39.98]Alright.
[146:40.73]These guys are spell resistant.
[146:42.21]What's with all the spell resistant?
[146:43.75]That sucks.
[146:52.91]Gum up the one on the right.
[146:57.87]Teeth.
[147:00.81]Put the music back up.
[147:05.41]Uh, I'm just going to do, let's do a safe play here and gump somebody up.
[147:09.65]Or I could do, I could set up a 17th scenario.
[147:13.21]Possible.
[147:13.61]It's going to take a while, though.
[147:22.85]If I go this way, I can do... So if I go that way and then this way.
[147:30.01]So if I, okay, hold on.
[147:35.99]And then bring this... up.
[147:41.86]And then 1, 2, 3... Wait, hold on.
[147:43.52]I don't want to do this wrong.
[147:45.60]It would have to be here.
[147:47.30]And then 1, 2... No, I don't think I can... I don't think I can do it.
[147:51.96]I'm gonna do the bottom row.
[148:05.11]Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, what happened?
[148:06.39]What happened?
[148:06.77]What?
[148:07.17]No, I tried to put it back.
[148:08.00]I tried to put it back.
[148:08.74]I tried to put it back.
[148:10.00]I, what?
[148:12.08]No, I want to put it back.
[148:13.20]I didn't put it back?
[148:16.00]Ugh.
[148:17.58]Fucked it up.
[148:18.30]It's, I fucked it.
[148:19.26]It's, I fucked it up.
[148:24.06]Ugh, that sucks.
[148:24.92]Okay, that's bad.
[148:27.84]Um.
[148:30.00]New plan.
[148:30.88]I got, I'm sorry, guys.
[148:31.92]I got to go with a new plan here.
[148:38.34]Fuck.
[148:50.97]Hook, use the hook.
[148:51.95]Hook, use the hook.
[148:52.87]Hook, use the hook.
[148:55.35]What am I using the hook on?
[148:58.57]Do one, two, three... If I break this, it'll break too much, won't it?
[149:07.34]This is going to destroy all this.
[149:08.34]Yeah, no, I'm not going to do that.
[149:16.34]Seven teeth spotted.
[149:17.54]Yeah.
[149:20.28]Too much stress.
[149:21.44]Okay.
[149:23.14]If I go... One, two, three.
[149:25.80]Okay.
[149:26.64]Here we go.
[149:27.96]I'm going to take a hit, but we're going to get seven teeth.
[149:48.75]God damn it.
[149:50.31]God damn it.
[149:55.59]Taking a lot of damage.
[149:57.37]Too much for my comfort.
[150:17.26]Wait.
[150:26.16]We're good.
[150:29.84]I can't whack them.
[150:30.40]They won't hurt them.
[150:35.39]Charges random usable item.
[150:38.21]Blinding attack.
[150:44.33]That's so expensive.
[150:45.51]I'm never going to use that.
[150:48.19]But I'm never going to use the lemon either.
[150:49.65]I mean, this is a guaranteed blinding attack instead of 50% blinding of enemies.
[150:54.99]Okay.
[151:08.68]Let's think about it.
[151:09.96]Let's poop.
[151:12.56]Right?
[151:12.96]Okay.
[151:13.58]What's the most dangerous thing here?
[151:25.00]The middle row, I guess.
[151:26.40]I don't know.
[151:26.86]I'm gonna kill this, though.
[151:30.03]Let's go on the left side.
[151:30.95]Okay.
[151:35.67]Right down the middle.
[151:38.01]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[151:41.52]Okay.
[151:56.12]Bad.
[151:57.06]Cancel.
[151:57.54]Fuck.
[151:58.10]What should I break?
[152:03.90]I have this.
[152:10.12]Not even worth doing.
[152:13.35]Oh boy.
[152:16.27]Teeth.
[152:19.33]Okay, let's kill everything.
[152:20.69]Let's kill everything.
[152:33.43]Shit.
[152:34.81]How do I kill this?
[152:36.69]How do I kill you?
[152:37.65]I don't even know how to kill this thing.
[152:39.64]I can't take a... I can't take a wild right now.
[152:44.34]Because if it goes right there, then I'm gonna be in big trouble.
[152:46.84]Look at this row.
[152:52.93]Do it?
[152:53.23]I don't think that's a good idea.
[152:55.13]You have to do it when his neck is up.
[153:01.58]When is his neck up?
[153:02.70]No, I'm not doing it.
[153:05.10]No way.
[153:10.76]Okay, now his neck is up.
[153:11.74]And there's two attacks coming on this side.
[153:13.56]I need a miracle right now.
[153:16.64]What's my miracle?
[153:20.88]Take a chance for once in your life.
[153:27.25]P into poo.
[153:35.95]Make the P. Can I do only four P's though?
[153:48.52]This is important.
[153:49.66]I'm in trouble.
[153:53.55]P in bones.
[154:01.20]Uh... Bone... Guys, I don't know.
[154:09.92]I could do this.
[154:10.70]Maybe do that and do... Oh, but wait.
[154:15.17]Hold on.
[154:15.57]Let's do this.
[154:18.51]Oh, and that's an extra bone.
[154:20.03]Oh, that's a lot of bone.
[154:23.23]That is a six bone, but... How many bones am I going to throw with six?
[154:31.57]Holy shit, this might actually, I might win.
[154:35.71]It's three throws?
[154:37.87]Okay.
[154:39.06]Everybody settle down.
[154:40.70]Two, four, six, that's four damage a throw.
[154:44.02]And then I can throw three times.
[154:47.52]One, two, three.
[154:51.40]And then up.
[154:54.74]And then up again.
[154:57.64]Here we go.
[155:02.89]Eight fucking damage.
[155:08.45]Okay.
[155:10.85]And let's blinding attack.
[155:12.90]On you.
[155:15.26]And then on... Ah, fuck.
[155:23.82]This is gonna get tricky.
[155:29.28]One heart.
[155:29.98]Bad.
[155:32.48]Although, I can't kill this thing.
[155:38.52]I could do a couple of whacks.
[155:39.88]I can't kill this thing with a whack, though.
[155:41.50]Eight health.
[155:42.12]Fuck off.
[155:59.09]Going right in the middle.
[156:01.52]And then I can kill these two.
[156:06.28]And I get rid of the poop in the middle.
[156:09.00]Sounds good.
[156:11.59]Alright.
[156:12.11]Poop again.
[156:29.31]Can I do Pooh again?
[156:30.99]In one turn?
[156:32.03]Or is it Bones?
[156:32.59]I'm gonna throw a Bone.
[156:35.90]Try to set the Poop up.
[156:36.86]Alright, so let's... If I go... Like this... No, no, that's too far.
[156:42.02]What about down here?
[156:42.92]No, no, no, no.
[156:44.62]Go over here.
[156:48.62]And then... Set up... Just do a Poop setup round.
[156:56.91]I think I'm just gonna throw... No, there's no reason to throw the bone.
[156:58.87]I just need to do poop.
[157:01.13]Or bone and teeth.
[157:03.50]Yeah.
[157:04.82]I'm just gonna do it.
[157:05.34]I need to... Might as well.
[157:07.58]Shit.
[157:27.57]I'm trying to hit the toilet paper.
[157:37.58]I can put an extra up.
[157:59.13]In fact, I want more poos.
[158:02.16]I'm going right here.
[158:03.16]No, no, it's not even worth it.
[158:06.84]It's not worth it.
[158:07.36]Just let it play out.
[158:10.79]I can poop next round anyway.
[158:13.25]So.
[158:15.39]Speaking of that.
[158:15.83]I can go over and then up.
[158:18.06]Or I can go...
[158:20.15]just pull it this way, and I get it for free, without having to do two moves.
[158:24.80]And then, would you look at that, I can set up for a booger next round.
[158:32.98]Can I?
[158:34.93]Maybe, sort of.
[158:39.51]Whatever.
[158:46.45]I cannot hurt this.
[158:48.52]I'm gonna hit it anyways, it's fun.
[158:58.85]Alright.
[159:00.74]I'm safe.
[159:01.50]I'm just gonna set up another... I'm gonna set up another poop.
[159:07.06]Which would be... This, right?
[159:10.71]Yeah.
[159:14.73]There it is.
[159:17.23]See you later.
[159:21.30]Woo!
[159:32.72]I need health.
[159:38.30]Hits all enemies.
[159:39.56]Rerolls a row of tiles.
[159:40.92]That's really good.
[159:44.13]I need heart.
[159:45.03]Bad.
[159:47.65]Rerolls a row of tiles.
[159:51.73]This is really good because I can activate the Addy with this.
[159:56.90]Right?
[159:57.78]That would be a huge, huge deal.
[160:07.28]Yeah, I don't want the random spell.
[160:09.51]It's too much.
[160:10.91]Uh-oh.
[160:13.55]Bumbo versus... Sangri?
[160:17.07]Go for the soft spot.
[160:31.11]Okay, I can... I can do a poop right now.
[160:36.29]Which is good.
[160:48.55]Get it on there.
[160:49.19]Let's see if... Can I hurt him?
[160:53.17]Yes, I can.
[160:58.27]Oh, he... When you hit him once, he closes.
[161:00.43]He has to open back up again.
[161:07.01]I get it.
[161:08.17]Okay.
[161:09.09]We need to go... I gotta get pee.
[161:10.55]Because I need pee and then poo so I can kill him in like one hit.
[161:19.24]Oh, oh boy.
[161:22.86]Holy shit.
[161:23.82]He's right here.
[161:24.78]Okay, P and then Poo.
[161:26.18]Is it possible to do P and Poo right now?
[161:29.96]I don't think so.
[161:30.58]Let me see.
[161:31.28]I can do P, but I don't have a Poo setup.
[161:37.27]Can I take one hit?
[161:47.96]I can't take one hit.
[161:52.06]He'll hit you more than once.
[161:53.02]Uh-oh.
[161:54.46]He's going to hit you three times.
[162:04.00]What's the other play here?
[162:05.19]Is to gum him up for a run?
[162:11.47]Do the blind attack.
[162:13.87]Will that actually do it?
[162:24.06]How long are they blind for?
[162:28.94]I'm gonna try it.
[162:29.82]I'll try it.
[162:34.46]Let's go for the attack with the blind.
[162:36.84]Blind is RNG but could save the whole thing.
[162:38.32]Let's try it.
[162:49.39]Oh, he's back.
[162:50.19]Alright.
[162:51.47]So now, blind him.
[162:53.09]Will this work?
[162:56.16]Is he gonna just run up to me?
[163:03.45]I mean, I just pushed him.
[163:04.23]He's really far back now.
[163:05.89]Please don't kill me.
[163:08.87]One, two, three... Oh!
[163:28.90]I'm dead.
[163:30.30]I could do P, but it's not going to help.
[163:33.32]P and then maybe throw a Wild in and hope I get RNG?
[163:42.73]Boogers.
[163:44.95]Battery and Boogers?
[163:52.39]He's knocked back.
[163:53.97]That doesn't help me, though.
[163:56.35]And then hold him there.
[164:02.03]That's how you say it.
[164:02.69]Go bang bang.
[164:04.69]And then just hold them in place.
[164:06.85]Just booger them.
[164:07.79]I'll try it.
[164:16.20]Stuck.
[164:28.15]Right here, I think.
[164:29.81]Should I destroy the curses?
[164:35.38]Give me shit.
[164:36.14]I need poo.
[164:40.10]Over here?
[164:47.05]Should I press it?
[164:47.77]I don't think I should press it.
[164:59.57]No!
[165:00.77]I thought he was...
[165:06.50]I thought he was frozen.
[165:07.74]Oh, it's only one.
[165:08.50]He gets three turns.
[165:09.76]Fuck, that guy sucks.
[165:13.60]Damn.
[165:15.52]Damn it.
[165:16.76]Ah, damn it.
[165:18.50]Oh, no.
[165:19.88]Damn it.
[165:22.03]Oh, well.
[165:28.63]Super booger.
[165:44.20]I'm so sad.
[165:47.82]I'll just do Pooh.
[165:49.40]It's better that way.
[165:52.96]That was a cool run.
[165:53.82]Yeah, it was.
[165:54.42]Oh well.
[165:59.94]It was cool.
[166:10.01]Permadeath?
[166:10.77]Yeah.
[166:12.08]There is permadeath.
[166:13.68]You just start over.
[166:15.52]But every time you beat it, you unlock new stuff.
[166:17.72]Just get a bone up here, maybe?
[166:33.41]Get down with this.
[166:41.92]Why'd I do that?
[166:42.74]Oh, that... No.
[166:43.66]I'm an idiot.
[166:46.27]Well, I'm a... I'm a... I'm a... I'm as dumb as a sack of rocks.
[166:49.59]I thought I could do seven.
[166:57.61]Yeah, we know.
[166:58.45]We don't.
[167:00.47]Get out of here.
[167:08.74]Um...
[167:13.61]I could do... I could do this.
[167:17.37]Then... I don't know.
[167:19.31]I could do this.
[167:22.73]I'm gonna get hit, though.
[167:27.75]How many teeth?
[167:40.50]I'm so sad.
[167:41.04]That build was so cool.
[167:45.49]Maybe I can do a similar one.
[167:51.49]Change any tile to a wild.
[167:55.67]Yeah.
[167:56.97]Immediately.
[167:57.45]Okay.
[168:08.62]This is a lot of boogers.
[168:12.26]But we go Pooh first always.
[168:24.85]uh I guess I probably shouldn't put it there but I can I'll be fine who do I gum ah do this I don't need danger
[168:54.08]I'm not in any real danger or anything.
[168:58.72]Alright, um... Bones.
[169:16.98]Okay, let's just get rid of this.
[169:19.42]Cool.
[169:21.36]Show auto!
[169:22.20]Show auto!
[169:33.44]Okay, how many throws do I get?
[169:34.34]Two?
[169:37.52]Yeah.
[169:39.77]And then we can do this.
[169:43.91]Get you with a tooth!
[169:49.93]Now you have to show Otto.
[169:52.39]Otto's such a good boy.
[169:53.69]He's such a good boy.
[170:11.24]Valve announced the new Half-Life game.
[170:12.90]Yeah, that's pretty big news right now, isn't it?
[170:15.52]That is a pretty big deal.
[170:18.25]Change any... Okay, I need to pee.
[170:21.67]Although... I don't have a terrible setup here to do this, maybe?
[170:31.43]I can just do it now.
[170:33.13]Yeah, I need it now.
[170:33.85]I gotta start killing stuff, you know?
[170:40.15]Half-Life VR.
[170:44.78]Yeah, hopefully it's good.
[170:46.52]I hope it's good.
[170:47.10]I got bone next turn.
[170:55.16]I'm going to put this over here.
[170:58.10]Because I'm going to kill these things in the middle.
[171:07.82]Uh-oh.
[171:11.72]Uh-oh!
[171:14.28]That's actually a real uh-oh.
[171:15.26]I'm not gonna kill this.
[171:31.45]How many throws do I have?
[171:34.75]Get rid of you.
[171:37.42]Get rid of you.
[171:43.49]Ow!
[171:44.17]I actually kind of somehow nonchalantly ended up making this way worse.
[171:51.75]Um... The soundtrack isn't great.
[172:00.72]Uh... I think it's okay.
[172:04.48]I'd like a little more variety, though.
[172:10.01]Try to make some wilds.
[172:13.74]Kind of in trouble.
[172:14.34]Do I have enough to... I could do the extra turn, but I don't think it's going to do anything for me.
[172:29.23]I guess I could do the extra turn and try to make a wild?
[172:31.21]Let's do tooth.
[172:37.81]That'll kill that.
[172:39.71]And then I could do the extra.
[172:40.72]Yeah, let's do that.
[172:41.62]Oh!
[172:43.61]And then move this.
[172:47.15]Now I have any tile as a wild, which... I could do that.
[172:52.89]Which I'm just gonna do.
[172:54.86]Because why the hell not?
[173:01.56]Don't win yet.
[173:02.18]I do win now, though.
[173:14.83]Yes, I do.
[173:16.03]Wait.
[173:18.17]Yes, I do.
[173:20.83]Kill the rock?
[173:22.21]What does that get?
[173:22.73]Is there something in the rock?
[173:24.94]Should I stall and heal?
[173:27.88]Is there actual shit in the rock?
[173:32.58]There's nothing in the rock.
[173:45.14]Change anything into a wild.
[173:46.48]Okay, so let me... we're just gonna stall, apparently.
[174:10.08]Am I really gonna do this?
[174:15.94]What do you mean wasted?
[174:16.80]Poo rock.
[174:19.86]I don't need... I don't need seven.
[174:21.64]Why do I need seven?
[174:23.48]Hit rock with poop.
[174:29.03]This doesn't do anything.
[174:36.15]Uh, well, I want to get rid of the bones, though.
[174:38.13]Because if I am going to just try to get this farm wilds to heal, then... That's the plan, then.
[174:46.65]There's a wild right there.
[174:50.36]Don't throw that.
[174:51.42]Okay, I want to move... Not like I'm going to do anything.
[175:00.14]Okay, let's... I need P to farm the wilds too.
[175:02.95]I got three hits here.
[175:05.41]Alright, let's bring this with P. Let's get some P here.
[175:10.73]Go down and then over.
[175:15.44]Whatever.
[175:17.95]The rock doesn't do anything.
[175:18.77]Yeah, I know.
[175:21.49]There we go.
[175:26.33]So let's make this... Let's bring this over here.
[175:28.68]I gotta make sure I don't actually activate this somehow.
[175:33.30]Okay, no.
[175:37.54]Alright, we're good.
[175:38.25]Here's the heal.
[175:39.33]Right?
[175:39.61]Yes.
[175:44.11]Alright, let's go.
[175:58.13]Floor 1.
[176:02.01]Plus 3 movement.
[176:02.95]I'm never going to have that.
[176:03.97]Gain 1 to 2 coins.
[176:05.13]I mean, that's just free money every couple rooms.
[176:17.59]Vote to cancel.
[176:18.59]This is what we're playing.
[176:22.95]There is no vote to change the game.
[176:24.47]This is the game that I'm playing.
[176:30.64]What's going on in here?
[176:35.34]If that vote passes, then we times two the amount of time.
[176:38.00]I will spend a week playing this game.
[176:40.03]I will spend the next seven straight days playing this game.
[176:43.17]What are you talking about?
[176:43.95]I mean, I'm not going to do that, but... I'm having a... This is a good game.
[176:57.32]Well, free coins.
[176:58.28]Let's take them.
[177:01.91]I don't know what this dude does.
[177:02.69]Uh-oh, Kenshi.
[177:09.83]Jerma lied about playing Bumbo for seven days.
[177:13.47]Jerma lied about pooping his pants.
[177:14.57]Alright, let's set this up down, and then I'm just gonna do this.
[177:20.17]Freeze him.
[177:24.75]And then... I think that's fine.
[177:30.90]He can't do... Well, he's going to move twice.
[177:33.40]But, that's okay.
[177:37.54]I think he's just going to get really close.
[177:39.81]But, that's okay.
[177:40.81]Because... Do I have an opportunity for a poop right now?
[177:48.21]I can throw a tooth at him.
[177:53.77]Or I can set up a five poop.
[178:01.24]I could do one, two, three, four, five.
[178:04.53]Five head.
[178:06.49]I mean, I could go, I could set up down here, and then up, and then... Alright.
[178:19.18]Cool.
[178:32.59]Might be able to kill him right now.
[178:37.71]Ooh, you break up into little things.
[178:46.42]Right down Main Street, let's go.
[178:51.82]Oh, every time you hit him.
[178:54.80]Alright, that's actually a pretty good thing to do.
[178:56.82]What is this?
[178:57.78]Are these extra poops?
[179:00.82]Well, that's terrible.
[179:15.65]That sucks.
[179:16.69]I think I'm gonna have to... I just... I don't know.
[179:26.74]Make a tooth?
[179:28.56]Yeah.
[179:30.96]Maybe it'll knock him back?
[179:33.64]Yes, it will.
[179:34.78]And he destroys all that shit.
[179:37.43]Did he go over the poo?
[179:40.03]Fuck, how am I supposed to clear all this?
[179:49.16]This is so much stuff to clear!
[179:50.62]Um...
[180:00.92]It's just... wait, it's hiding them.
[180:03.34]Oh.
[180:04.74]That makes more sense.
[180:06.30]I guess I'm... Shit, this guy's gonna kill me.
[180:13.87]I think this is R.I.P.
[180:15.25]Uh... Yeah.
[180:20.52]This sucked.
[180:23.56]This sucked.
[180:27.60]I think I just need to get lucky and do poo, right?
[180:31.28]I'm just going to hope that there's a poo up here.
[180:37.52]Wait, how do I... I don't understand.
[180:42.19]I thought it was hiding them.
[180:45.51]No?
[180:52.52]It is, but they have to be revealed before...
[180:57.56]Shit, move the row and it'll uncover the one that I'm on.
[181:01.92]Well, I guess I'm gonna do this.
[181:04.94]Damn it.
[181:06.42]That was worth a shot.
[181:07.36]Oh, he didn't even attack me!
[181:09.20]He didn't even attack!
[181:09.90]He didn't attack yet!
[181:12.06]What?
[181:17.80]Uh-oh.
[181:18.34]Okay.
[181:23.50]He hit the poop shield.
[181:24.46]Yeah, he usually spits.
[181:25.64]And he goes over the poop shield.
[181:28.79]So it's the shape of these that matter.
[181:31.81]So which one is poo, do we know?
[181:40.09]Teeth?
[181:44.74]Tooth and wind, tooth and wind.
[181:46.30]I guess, yeah, I could do this, right?
[181:48.78]Yeah.
[181:56.72]It's only one damage though.
[182:05.10]Got it.
[182:05.34]That was close.
[182:12.45]That was really close.
[182:22.04]Hmm.
[182:24.12]Charge any item.
[182:25.18]More green tiles.
[182:28.48]Damn it, I wish that was more poop tiles.
[182:35.11]charge any item.
[182:35.91]What do I have for item right now?
[182:37.48]I guess, does the... I have the coin.
[182:42.76]I don't think that's worth it.
[182:46.86]Just means I can get two coins every two rooms.
[182:49.88]One to two coins.
[182:50.50]Yeah, but I can only use this once, right?
[182:52.74]Well, let's get the nose goblin.
[182:53.74]Let's try to build around green.
[182:57.34]Alright, what do we got?
[183:01.36]Spells hurt more.
[183:06.32]I mean, it's so simple just to make, to do this, try this again.
[183:10.50]Try the same run again.
[183:11.94]I can try it.
[183:20.19]Let's see if I can do it again.
[183:21.23]And then re-roll spell cost, re-roll spell cost.
[183:25.35]Should I try to... But what if I make it larger?
[183:34.38]Reroll it to boogers.
[183:36.80]Wait.
[183:39.28]That's what that does?
[183:41.90]So there's a 1 in 5 chance that this will be rolled into a booger.
[183:49.42]Fuck.
[183:53.38]The worst one possible.
[184:14.81]speed I get an extra move that's pretty huge actually that's really huge that's a big deal run fucked run saved yeah poop is an outcome is not vital at all but it still is because I still it hurts a lot I just did the it does another damage
[184:43.58]Three damage.
[184:44.16]It was four bones.
[184:48.08]No, but poop is so important anyways.
[184:51.04]And I got so much more nose goblins.
[184:56.05]Well.
[184:59.93]Go for five bones.
[185:04.95]Might as well.
[185:24.22]And then whack the fuck out of the middle.
[185:29.97]What just happened?
[185:37.29]Uh... Why is it... What?
[185:38.75]Okay.
[185:45.35]Those die when you have them all in the ground.
[185:47.91]Oh.
[185:51.21]Yeah, for those that I can't, these things, I cannot hit these with this, they are resistant to all spells.
[185:58.01]Well, we're just gonna booger.
[186:03.01]Booger the middle too, I guess.
[186:04.61]And then I could do, I could do, hold on.
[186:13.94]I could do some extra moves here.
[186:21.43]Any tile?
[186:21.95]Wild.
[186:29.80]Wait, did I already have it?
[186:30.68]No.
[186:31.22]Fuck.
[186:31.54]I think I might have.
[186:35.20]Do some poop here.
[186:36.00]I could do up.
[186:37.02]I could do up, up, and then wild in the middle.
[186:48.47]And let's stick that right in the middle.
[186:56.81]Well, I don't really want to destroy anything.
[187:01.03]I gotta knock all these guys down.
[187:02.29]That's a pain.
[187:12.03]I could throw a bone over here and then whack the middle again.
[187:18.18]Sticky him again.
[187:24.55]I'm gonna deal with those balls last.
[187:26.19]I'm gonna throw a bone.
[187:27.03]I have free moves, so... I could just... One, two, yeah, whatever, fuck it.
[187:43.56]Not like it matters.
[187:53.22]Okay.
[187:54.02]Can I kill you?
[187:55.18]I can kill you now with teeth.
[187:59.32]And then I... Do I have a... I can do glue in the middle.
[188:01.60]I can do a big... I can do... Okay, hold on.
[188:03.28]What does seven glue do?
[188:06.22]That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[188:08.34]I don't think I can... No, I can't do it.
[188:11.47]I can only do, like, five... Wait, hold on.
[188:15.03]If I go up here... That would be one, two, three, four, five, six.
[188:28.41]But what if I go over here, that'd be one, hold on.
[188:30.39]What if I move it over this way?
[188:32.53]That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, right?
[188:38.04]I think I'm doing this right.
[188:40.98]Because then I go like this, and then I go like this.
[188:49.64]Do nine boogers?
[188:51.02]What happens if, what does that do?
[188:54.90]No, I can't do 9.
[188:56.16]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[188:58.02]Fuck.
[189:00.80]I can't do 9.
[189:02.78]Can I do 7, though?
[189:03.64]I don't know.
[189:03.98]I think I screwed it up.
[189:08.70]I can?
[189:15.33]I can't do 7.
[189:15.91]No, I can do 6.
[189:16.35]What do you mean you can?
[189:19.27]What?
[189:21.61]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[189:23.51]I can't... If I move this way... No, I can't do it.
[189:28.40]If you just do it on the top row, I'll... Do six.
[189:33.56]No, it's not worth it.
[189:37.82]No!
[189:49.87]These guys are a little annoying aren't they?
[190:12.49]You're a little irritating, aren't you?
[190:19.79]Let's get some wild.
[190:20.77]Bone!
[190:22.25]How many bones can I do?
[190:23.99]Any more pee?
[190:28.25]Wait, just a minute.
[190:30.65]Bone!
[190:31.09]Bone!
[190:33.61]Don't even need the wild.
[190:34.89]Well, I have to use it, though.
[190:40.83]I could go one, two, three, four... Can I do five?
[190:44.42]I could do six bone, maybe.
[190:47.36]If I do 1, 2, 3.
[190:49.62]So you'd say 1, 2, 3.
[190:57.53]And then I could do a wild there.
[191:00.02]A wild here.
[191:01.42]No, no, a wild here.
[191:04.80]Move this over and go up.
[191:09.49]So go, do I have this right?
[191:12.03]Five bones wins.
[191:14.54]Am I fucking this whole thing up?
[191:15.84]One, two, three, four, there's the wild.
[191:18.46]Okay, there's the wild.
[191:24.73]Hold on, Jeremy, don't fuck this up yet.
[191:27.37]One, oh, five just wins, don't matter.
[191:50.44]Heals one heart, lose one move.
[191:54.20]Attack a whole row.
[191:55.72]You guys want to put on Chill Step?
[192:04.95]What do you think?
[192:14.31]Epic Chill Step.
[192:25.14]Alright, let's put on some chill step for a while.
[192:27.10]Because, yeah, this music is starting to, like, burn into my brain.
[192:34.08]How do I turn this down, though?
[192:35.24]I know you can.
[192:35.82]I know.
[192:38.67]I swear to God I saw it.
[192:39.75]Attack of Rove.
[192:41.13]That's pretty good.
[192:42.73]But heals one heart, loses one move.
[192:44.59]That's actually bad.
[192:45.25]But this could be a big deal, too.
[192:51.93]I'm always needing heals.
[192:58.55]Do the volume mixer?
[192:59.41]Yeah, but then you lose all the audio from the game too.
[193:02.85]I'm gonna do the heal.
[193:05.65]They're both six.
[193:08.75]That's a full heart, I'm doing it.
[193:10.25]I swear, where's that menu?
[193:27.05]If you use a move, is it gone forever?
[193:29.49]Only... This... For me, yes.
[193:31.94]Because it... Well, not technically.
[193:34.06]There's two rooms.
[193:35.34]If I press this like I should have pressed, like, last round.
[193:38.60]Now that in two rooms, this will be ready to be used again.
[193:41.86]Now, I have to collect... I almost said claws.
[193:46.03]I have to collect bones.
[193:47.59]If I get four bones, I can use this move.
[193:50.15]You store them until the end of the round for this character, which then you all go to zero for all of your abilities.
[193:55.61]It's complicated.
[193:56.39]You need to read a book.
[194:00.88]Alright.
[194:07.50]I think I want wilds.
[194:09.94]I could go... I could just do... I need a poop.
[194:16.43]Right in the middle.
[194:18.03]And then...
[194:35.71]Fuck!
[194:36.33]What the fuck is that?
[194:37.76]It didn't hurt it?
[194:43.30]What?
[194:43.62]I don't... Okay, it still has three.
[194:51.90]Fuck me.
[194:56.71]I should have just used that!
[194:57.83]I'm so fucking... I was so tilted from that last thing.
[195:02.58]I wasted the lard.
[195:03.62]Oh, it's alright.
[195:04.70]Check this out.
[195:05.44]I got how many?
[195:11.36]One, two, three.
[195:12.71]Okay, here we go.
[195:15.37]Ready?
[195:17.81]One, two, three.
[195:18.35]Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[195:20.67]Didn't I have three turns?
[195:37.29]Okay, I just did a shitload of stuff there.
[195:45.26]Should I hit this guy again?
[195:46.78]Will he die if I do small or hit the guy in the middle?
[196:00.54]Okay, hold on a second here.
[196:01.92]Look at all these turns I have.
[196:04.50]Give me the coins back.
[196:06.86]Okay.
[196:08.10]Um... I could... This is gonna take a much more calculated brain than me.
[196:14.63]There's... Bone.
[196:17.09]Bone, bone.
[196:17.97]I could do a lot of bones here.
[196:19.13]I could move this over.
[196:20.97]So I could have... One, two, three.
[196:22.95]No, I could do five... I could do five bones with a wild...
[196:28.24]Could I do seven?
[196:28.94]I could do two.
[196:30.34]No, I could do one, two, three, four.
[196:34.24]Teeth for the heel.
[196:35.82]Oh, man.
[196:36.54]Okay.
[196:38.97]I could do seven bones, couldn't I?
[196:40.41]They'd have to be very strategic.
[196:45.47]Because it would have to be make this a wild, make this a wild, which would be one, two, three, four, five, six.
[197:06.37]If I move over here, and then I go down, down, and then make it a wild.
[197:15.05]Changed it to a wild.
[197:17.01]So let's go.
[197:31.54]Still, still not doing so well.
[197:34.02]Okay.
[197:36.43]I need teeth now.
[197:41.03]How many teeth can I do?
[197:41.95]I could do one, two, three, I could do five.
[197:46.47]Because if I do this, I can do the one on the right.
[197:53.69]Can I do, wait, I can, no, no, no, I can do more than that.
[197:59.87]I could do, move this down.
[198:04.26]And then move one to the right.
[198:06.22]Go up.
[198:12.35]I need another wild.
[198:14.75]Shit, yeah.
[198:15.39]I can still do five or six.
[198:16.63]Because if I go over here, that means... Bring the one on the right up.
[198:25.67]Bring the one on the left down.
[198:33.67]Wild on the left.
[198:35.75]Do I have enough time to do this?
[198:37.49]Wild on the left.
[198:38.37]I don't have enough time to do this.
[198:43.66]I thought I had one more move.
[198:45.38]Um... Fuck, I thought I had another move.
[198:52.78]Whack?
[198:53.24]I know, I'm just trying to set this up for success.
[198:56.74]Who am I whacking, though?
[198:58.36]Guy on the right or guy in the middle?
[198:59.28]Guy in the middle.
[199:03.65]Streamer doesn't read chat.
[199:05.27]Yes, he does.
[199:13.70]And then let's get rid of you.
[199:16.60]Actually, go right in the middle.
[199:19.76]No.
[199:20.34]Right in the middle.
[199:23.38]Why did he... What happened?
[199:24.46]What happened?
[199:26.11]I can't swing because you're in the... He's in the air.
[199:30.65]What have I done with this one?
[199:35.46]Oh, okay.
[199:37.60]I can kill this, though, and then I can heal.
[199:39.96]There's nobody attacking me right now, so let's just do what I was going to do before, which is wild.
[199:45.64]Bring this down.
[199:49.02]Now with it at you, insta-dead.
[199:51.95]Just kidding.
[199:53.71]Heal a full heart.
[199:59.43]Good.
[199:59.53]Good.
[200:04.11]This is Candy Crush with extra steps.
[200:06.45]And it was made by Edmund McMillan.
[200:15.05]I think I'm being stupid.
[200:16.67]Am I being stupid here?
[200:17.75]Wait.
[200:20.35]Uh... Get the wild.
[200:30.74]And then...
[200:34.62]put it here that's not gonna work uh put move this down and then move this down and do that I don't know backseat backseat yeah I mean it's the nature of these games you only have two moves yeah so I have to
[201:00.03]You still have three?
[201:00.66]Yeah, I still have three moves.
[201:02.28]That move, that's good at the very end.
[201:04.12]Alright, I'm gonna do, let's do Booger and P. That's a good one.
[201:09.01]So if I go down like this and then bring it down like that, no.
[201:12.25]Oh, man.
[201:13.19]I second guess everything I do in these games.
[201:16.32]Because even if there's like five ways to do it, I will figure out somehow the sixth way that's the wrong way to do it.
[201:21.76]It just happens every time.
[201:23.82]I'm going to go for this, I think.
[201:26.94]I think?
[201:27.70]I don't know.
[201:28.48]I haven't figured it out yet.
[201:29.63]I'm still trying to figure that out.
[201:31.27]How about down from here?
[201:32.29]No.
[201:42.15]Let's go like this.
[201:42.89]Let's gum this up.
[201:50.37]Which will then allow me to go like this.
[201:55.46]Which will then allow me to change something else into a wild.
[201:58.64]I could have two wilds somewhere over here.
[202:03.60]Where do I want those?
[202:04.50]How about...
[202:11.95]I only have one move left.
[202:13.37]I have to kill this thing.
[202:14.47]The dude right there, and just throw the bone at him.
[202:22.48]But that's not going to kill it, though.
[202:23.66]But I could whack it, too.
[202:24.52]Okay.
[202:38.48]This is a heart scenario.
[202:39.90]I've got one more move to do.
[202:41.90]Let's just... I mean, that's not going to help, but... Let me set up a super move for next round.
[202:59.45]It's the first time we've seen that.
[203:03.21]Cool.
[203:22.76]Let's do a heart while they're... Here.
[203:29.44]Right?
[203:29.74]No.
[203:30.54]Yeah.
[203:33.10]No.
[203:33.45]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[203:34.79]I need to bring... You... Fuck.
[203:38.39]Okay.
[203:42.23]Up, up.
[203:43.01]Up, up.
[203:43.67]Can I do this?
[203:44.13]I need to get P. Okay, we're gonna do P, wild, and then...
[203:53.34]Oh, fuck me.
[203:55.78]Bring this up?
[203:56.50]No, bring this up.
[203:59.55]Okay, am I doing it right?
[204:01.61]I hope so.
[204:03.51]I am.
[204:10.31]Wait, don't use this yet.
[204:16.15]What if I get hit?
[204:24.13]Make a seven heart stack.
[204:28.17]Hold on.
[204:31.04]Wait a second.
[204:33.56]Just don't get hit.
[204:34.92]You'll be stunned for an extra turn.
[204:36.28]But what... Okay, what can I make?
[204:37.56]What happens if you do seven hearts?
[204:38.94]Do you get a permanent full heart?
[204:47.25]You get a soul heart.
[204:50.09]Because I would only need two more, which I could maybe do peas?
[204:55.00]That's a soul heart?
[204:55.94]Oh, that's not really worth it.
[205:00.02]I mean, they're like, it's not worth it.
[205:02.74]Seven hearts stack.
[205:06.60]There's a two-way poop right here.
[205:08.70]Does that work?
[205:10.70]Try to get the seven hearts.
[205:12.64]They're worth it?
[205:13.96]Well, I'm just going to make this a wild then, and then see if we can make it happen.
[205:23.77]Do the two-way poop.
[205:26.99]That two-way don't work.
[205:28.93]Let's see.
[205:29.37]Can I get some more wilds here?
[205:31.77]I don't think so.
[205:39.96]That's... I think seven hearts is going to be kind of out of reach.
[205:44.34]Yeah.
[205:48.82]Yeah.
[205:53.81]It's gonna take too long.
[205:54.60]Because there's only three peas on the board.
[205:59.40]I can't... Let's do seven poop.
[206:04.89]And then I'm just gonna heal.
[206:09.95]Oh, fuck it.
[206:10.43]Let's just do it now.
[206:11.12]Who cares?
[206:25.82]Alright, let's set up a good bone scenario.
[206:28.02]That looks pretty good.
[206:34.54]Don't look behind you, Monka.
[206:36.02]Whatever.
[207:00.04]You can miss in this game?
[207:01.56]Oh, because he went off the right.
[207:09.07]Wait.
[207:10.25]Let's make it a good end.
[207:30.63]Have we seen these enemies yet?
[207:31.51]I don't think so.
[207:31.91]This might be the first time.
[207:32.83]So.
[207:34.59]Hmm.
[207:36.84]P. I'm gonna do P. Get a wild in this scenario.
[207:48.12]Down wild.
[207:51.78]These guys have a lot of health too.
[207:56.07]I'm gonna go poo on the left.
[208:07.87]Then I'm gonna do, let's set up the teeth for next round, dude.
[208:12.99]One, two, three, one, two, three, I guess, whatever.
[208:15.75]Now let's do three down, one, two, I just need a P. If I do one, two, three, and then one, two, three, I could kill them all potentially.
[208:32.30]Fuck it.
[208:32.58]Let's go for it.
[208:33.20]Sometimes you gotta do the big play.
[208:34.88]Alright, then up, down, and then we got one move.
[208:38.22]Let's go.
[208:38.58]There's a seven right there.
[208:51.51]See if this does anything.
[208:57.79]Oh, fuck.
[208:58.75]I did not know that was going to happen.
[209:04.75]Well, nobody's attacking.
[209:06.11]Okay.
[209:27.60]What do I destroy?
[209:28.36]I don't think I want to destroy anything.
[209:32.04]Nobody's gonna move.
[209:35.25]And let's go... Yeah, green doesn't hurt you unless you attack.
[209:40.17]So, I need to wait.
[209:41.91]I could do some wilds.
[209:43.43]I think that's a good idea.
[209:45.91]Up or down?
[209:46.87]Probably, yeah, up, because I want the bone.
[209:52.65]Uh, wild for poo.
[209:54.70]Or just stick a wild on the board.
[209:56.16]Who cares, right?
[209:59.54]Yeah, just stick them all out on the board.
[210:00.58]Right here.
[210:03.58]Whatever.
[210:03.94]Fuck, right here.
[210:14.11]Alright, whatever.
[210:29.14]Alright, this should be the boss, right?
[210:37.83]Loose change.
[210:39.21]Gain coins equals to next damage.
[210:41.37]What the fuck does that mean?
[210:48.03]Gain coins equals to next damage taken.
[210:50.72]So gain... This one's interesting.
[210:54.32]I like that one.
[210:57.82]That seems cool.
[211:00.42]That's one coin for every damage you take.
[211:03.83]So, like, one, two, three, four.
[211:05.43]Let's just do these both.
[211:10.33]Bumbo versus Gibbs.
[211:11.91]Heavy hits are best.
[211:13.07]Okay, let's go.
[211:19.56]Ah!
[211:21.82]Heavy hits are best.
[211:22.62]What the hell does this Jell-O cube even do?
[211:26.78]I could do poo just to make sure I get some safety here.
[211:31.26]1, 2, 3.
[211:31.86]1, 2, 3.
[211:32.70]Should I set up a... I'm going to set up a huge poo, I think.
[211:35.37]How much time do I got?
[211:36.33]Enough, right?
[211:36.97]I don't know.
[211:39.03]Yeah, I'm doing it.
[211:55.47]Now.
[211:55.79]Hold on.
[211:58.05]Alright, this is important.
[211:59.09]Ready?
[212:00.81]One, two.
[212:01.41]This is my wild.
[212:05.08]Bring this down.
[212:07.00]Let's do it.
[212:09.32]Super poop.
[212:15.13]And I can slow you down.
[212:22.34]So I'm protected, but I need to do big hits.
[212:25.34]Reroll a row of tiles.
[212:26.96]Which row?
[212:29.62]Seven bone or super tooth?
[212:32.54]I'm probably going to say bones.
[212:37.88]Just reroll the whole top row.
[212:41.11]I got a wild here now, though.
[212:43.37]I'm thinking drag this over here and bring it down.
[212:55.51]Second top row reroll.
[212:56.75]I could... But I can make a... This is... Right now, I can just throw a tooth at him.
[213:03.75]If I do this, then I can set up... Let me try this.
[213:10.11]Yeah, this is the one right here.
[213:11.31]Check this out.
[213:16.33]Because I'm going to go... Next round, I'm going to go bang, bang.
[213:19.01]Drag this down seven bone.
[213:21.78]I don't want to reroll anything right now.
[213:28.38]Let's do it.
[213:39.61]Kill!
[213:42.75]But!
[213:45.79]He's dead.
[213:50.69]That was... He was just kind of a... big... piece of meat.
[213:56.20]I wonder what he does if you leave him alone.
[214:00.52]More brown tiles, damn it.
[214:03.18]Now, having me re-roll that thing is a bad idea.
[214:10.80]Me having the stupid bones for the smash, it could have been.
[214:14.94]Re-roll it again.
[214:16.70]I could.
[214:17.18]Raises crit chance, but how much does that mean?
[214:22.70]More poo for more hammer.
[214:24.42]No, the hammer's bones now.
[214:30.06]Remember?
[214:30.38]I know, but my whack is for bones.
[214:38.53]Remember I re-rolled it?
[214:45.09]Crit.
[214:51.62]I'm taking the crit.
[214:54.38]Okay, what do we got?
[214:57.11]Reroll the spell.
[214:58.27]Reroll spell cost.
[215:00.65]Spell cost less. ...
[215:22.90]Reroll spell cost.
[215:24.77]On this one, you mean?
[215:26.01]To try to get boogers?
[215:34.71]But what if it's... Fuck you.
[216:01.35]I'm gonna do spell cost less on wild, I think, because that's just been such a... This is the only thing that's gonna keep this together.
[216:13.34]On the heal, you think?
[216:17.76]Maybe, I don't... I'm thinking the wilds, if I could place like... Because if I do one match, I could place two wilds instead of one.
[216:28.11]That's the play.
[216:31.28]Spin the wheel.
[216:38.37]Moving.
[216:46.51]Now, should I re-roll the spell?
[216:50.65]Yeah, I don't... I don't care about this.
[216:55.20]I really don't.
[216:59.50]I would much rather have anything else
[217:03.19]Wait, this is an item.
[217:03.95]I can reroll it, though.
[217:05.21]It says I can pick a spell to modify.
[217:06.91]Is this not blocked out?
[217:08.36]I don't even know what the hell... What was that?
[217:19.08]More bones.
[217:20.38]I don't even know what it was.
[217:25.11]Well, this is the run here.
[217:27.41]We're going to try.
[217:28.29]This is the third room, third area.
[217:32.03]Six bones.
[217:33.92]Halls of Belial.
[217:35.26]Come on.
[217:36.10]My build's terrible.
[217:38.94]Can you mute the game audio so I can take samples of you saying those bad words?
[217:43.51]Gain mana equals to most common tile.
[217:57.34]Let's do some P.
[218:01.48]Okay, I got two wilds I can put out here now.
[218:04.64]That's a big deal.
[218:05.62]So, super booger, I can do bang, bang, and then go up.
[218:10.42]Yep, right?
[218:12.71]And then, fuck.
[218:18.93]Go up, wild, go up.
[218:32.25]Bring the wave.
[218:34.87]All frozen for two turns.
[218:37.03]Let's do another wild on... I'm gonna say bones.
[218:44.70]We're looking for bones.
[218:46.34]So, let's destroy some shit.
[218:49.94]Try to make room for bones.
[218:55.06]Not bad.
[218:57.66]Pretty good.
[219:01.07]Okay.
[219:04.17]Not bad.
[219:05.21]Really not bad at all.
[219:09.05]Let's make this a wild?
[219:13.99]No, no.
[219:15.28]What's the best way to do this?
[219:17.92]Drag this over one.
[219:19.46]It might be hard to do this.
[219:20.22]So I need to do three.
[219:24.02]One, two, three.
[219:24.60]I'm going to have to move these around because I'm going to make four every time I move it.
[219:35.44]If I make one a wild, it'll just close it.
[219:37.90]So this has to be the wild.
[219:40.19]So that would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[219:41.29]Yeah, it's not going to be good.
[219:48.01]Move the left one down.
[219:49.95]Okay, so I move the left one down.
[219:51.39]That would be 1, 2, 3, 4.
[219:51.98]Now if I move that left one down, then this is a wild.
[219:57.34]It'll complete it.
[219:59.54]with a bone on the right away.
[220:01.34]So if I move this out of the way, then that means I got one, two, three.
[220:03.82]Alright, yeah, that's a play.
[220:05.96]So, the play is get this one out of the way, make this a wild, move this up, move this down.
[220:14.50]Kill him.
[220:18.90]Sounds like it.
[220:20.02]Hope I'm right.
[220:25.04]So, move this up.
[220:28.99]Move this up.
[220:30.09]Move this down.
[220:31.31]Kill him.
[220:34.25]Holy shit, I just got a double combo.
[220:44.96]I did.
[220:49.18]And gain mana to most common tile.
[220:54.72]No, just whack.
[220:57.04]Because it's not... Is it bones?
[220:58.18]It's not bones, is it?
[221:01.28]Because I could probably... Oh, no, I could kill this stuff right now.
[221:04.56]No, let's whack.
[221:06.85]Spell resistant.
[221:08.59]Fuck.
[221:10.97]Alright, hold on.
[221:11.67]This is not a bad... This is not terrible, because I'm just going to make more bones.
[221:15.73]Or teeth, or whatever.
[221:25.54]Look at that.
[221:26.02]Lots of bones now.
[221:26.86]Let's go.
[221:30.36]Alright.
[221:33.24]One, two, three.
[221:37.01]If I go this way... Alright, here we go.
[221:41.33]One, two, three.
[221:45.39]And then... One, two... Uh... One, two... I think.
[221:53.29]I'm just gonna tap the next round.
[221:57.86]Because this can come over here and make three.
[222:04.60]Yeah.
[222:05.12]So I'll make three and then bring the... Yeah.
[222:07.42]Let's go.
[222:13.24]So that makes one.
[222:18.10]Two.
[222:20.36]Oh, shit.
[222:21.04]In my pants.
[222:21.65]What happened?
[222:23.81]One.
[222:23.95]Two.
[222:28.82]Okay, we're good.
[222:33.61]Just do bones.
[222:44.07]Gain gray mana or blinding attack.
[222:46.55]Gray mana.
[222:51.24]Which is great.
[222:58.72]That's bones?
[222:59.64]Is it teeth?
[223:01.60]So I could infinite heal, potentially.
[223:03.18]It's teeth, okay.
[223:07.66]I think that's better than this.
[223:15.07]Rerolls a row of tiles.
[223:17.79]This one sucks.
[223:21.61]That's too much.
[223:24.13]I could heal...
[223:28.49]There's enough scenario where I would rather whack than use this.
[223:36.47]Let me beat the boss here.
[223:37.74]Let me at least get to the end of this damn game.
[223:40.28]Or at least this area.
[223:42.90]Alright.
[223:44.26]Three moves.
[223:46.36]I need some pee here.
[223:47.14]That doesn't really help, does it?
[224:06.59]What should I do?
[224:11.87]Setting it up.
[224:23.53]Alright.
[224:25.03]Let's go.
[224:27.97]Look at how many wilds I'm gonna have.
[224:36.15]Three wilds in a row.
[224:37.83]And I can move five times.
[224:45.78]Bones.
[224:46.54]Alright, so we've got wild here.
[224:49.08]No, I can move this down.
[224:51.82]Fuck.
[224:52.22]No, hold on.
[224:52.70]Let me think about this.
[224:56.63]If I move this over...
[225:02.17]I could do 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, and then up.
[225:10.08]Right?
[225:15.65]Let's go.
[225:37.81]Oh, fucking hell yeah.
[225:38.69]Look at this.
[225:39.93]I can just move and do it.
[225:40.67]I don't need the wilds.
[225:41.37]Alright, I'm in a good position.
[225:49.90]This is not a bad... Now I can whack away.
[225:55.86]Can I kill you?
[225:56.40]Are you dead?
[225:56.80]Hold on.
[225:58.58]Yeah, let me kill you first.
[226:01.28]Because you're the threat.
[226:03.18]And that means I got one thing left to...
[226:08.22]I don't have any more moves, but can I just end it right here?
[226:10.08]Yeah.
[226:12.32]Alright, I'm going to end it next turn.
[226:28.44]Did I get further?
[226:29.40]Is this as far as I've ever gotten?
[226:30.50]Uh-oh.
[226:35.31]So I'm assuming that means I cannot attack them, right?
[226:41.62]Yeah, I made it to the boss.
[226:42.38]Oh yeah, I did make it to the boss.
[226:43.48]You're right.
[226:43.78]Okay.
[226:44.88]So I cannot... I have to hurt these guys with spells.
[226:46.90]This is going to be a pain in the ass.
[226:51.94]Does the big summoning seven bone move count as a spell?
[226:57.50]Or do I have to kill them with the whack?
[227:00.22]I wonder.
[227:01.30]No, it doesn't.
[227:01.72]Okay.
[227:06.87]Well, maybe I should just try to freeze everybody right off the bat.
[227:13.67]So I could go like this, set up a... Yeah, let's set it up.
[227:19.61]So then I can bring this down.
[227:20.61]1, 2, 3... No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[227:22.77]Don't... Hold on a second.
[227:23.77]Don't mess this up.
[227:25.67]I want to get a big wave of goo.
[227:27.49]Because I want to freeze everybody.
[227:32.67]So if I bring this down, that's 3...
[227:35.82]Up.
[227:36.30]Up.
[227:36.84]I need to... Hope I'm doing this right.
[227:49.30]Shit.
[227:50.90]Oh god.
[227:51.52]Oh god.
[227:51.90]Oh god.
[227:52.24]Oh god.
[227:52.54]Oh god.
[227:52.88]Oh god.
[227:53.20]Oh god.
[227:53.56]I might have to cancel this plan.
[227:58.72]It's possible.
[227:59.28]I gotta... It's possible next turn.
[228:00.76]I only have one fucking move though.
[228:04.05]What?
[228:06.56]one move no that sucks uh I can do it all next turn and then no I can't can I I'm in trouble it's okay it's only one heart oh no what what was that I'm dead
[228:38.81]This is my only opportunity.
[228:39.97]Everyone has to be frozen and then hopefully I can make something happen.
[228:49.28]I hope this works.
[228:58.15]Oh, no.
[228:59.31]I'm so disappointed.
[229:00.73]That's so hard.
[229:03.87]I'm almost dead.
[229:06.61]I shouldn't have even tried to build the big one.
[229:08.28]It's okay.
[229:13.22]I'm going to try to get bones.
[229:22.00]This is not going to touch any bones, right?
[229:24.14]No?
[229:24.48]Okay.
[229:26.08]Holy shit.
[229:26.99]Are you kidding me?
[229:30.92]This is it.
[229:31.46]Game over.
[229:41.25]Yeah, it's game over.
[229:54.84]It is, right?
[229:56.56]Is there any scenario where I can live?
[230:01.35]Maybe.
[230:02.49]If I bring this down here, poop up the right side, get a bone, kill the right side... I think it's over.
[230:17.85]Do poop for the rerolls.
[230:24.80]Where do I put this, though?
[230:25.78]On the right?
[230:28.32]Reroll a row of tiles, but which row?
[230:33.67]I could do P, but that's not gonna be enough.
[230:40.06]What really ha- I got screwed here trying to reroll this into the green one.
[230:43.22]That was the big mistake.
[230:45.64]Do the third row.
[230:48.24]One, two, three, try to reroll this whole thing.
[230:56.51]Bone and then whack?
[230:57.67]Yeah, but I still- I'm gonna- I take damage.
[230:59.85]There's no way I don't take damage.
[231:08.84]Try to roll for a poop.
[231:11.64]Re-roll all the rows.
[231:18.45]That's just like throwing dice in the air.
[231:20.91]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[231:23.45]If only I had another move, I might be okay.
[231:30.58]Whatever.
[231:31.80]Let me see.
[231:32.46]Hold on.
[231:33.86]Cancel this.
[231:35.42]Here's the play that I see.
[231:38.99]The play that I see is... Try to... Can I... Is there a... No, there's no way I can do it.
[231:46.97]Fuck.
[231:47.33]I'm so sad.
[231:49.12]I'm so sad right now.
[232:06.77]Hold on.
[232:06.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[232:07.83]Wait a second.
[232:09.59]Hold on.
[232:10.07]Hold on.
[232:10.49]Everybody wait.
[232:11.13]Don't move.
[232:12.45]I can heal.
[232:14.71]But I need to... Can I gain... Wait.
[232:19.91]Hold on.
[232:20.21]I can heal a full heart.
[232:26.93]If I use this six times, I can heal a full heart.
[232:37.02]Because this is only a half heart.
[232:41.04]wild to heal but then yeah but then it's only half a heart I die I'm gonna hit three times wait maybe not let me try it let's see it let's go for it here we go now rip no direct I didn't even know I had this up there it don't matter it's a fine everything's fine we're gonna be fine I'm gonna do this it don't matter whatever it's okay
[233:08.54]Well, I'm up against the goddamn wall anyways, with like a toothpick versus a wild bear.
[233:13.95]It's not... I'm up against the wall.
[233:17.57]Let's try to booger him.
[233:24.51]Wait.
[233:25.41]Not yet.
[233:27.35]Bring this down.
[233:35.57]Oh, fuck you.
[233:47.54]I actually might not die.
[233:55.13]God damn it.
[233:56.01]If only I had done that first.
[233:57.65]How was I supposed to know?
[234:09.33]They moved twice in one turn.
[234:10.47]Yeah, I'm dead.
[234:11.83]Well, that was fun while it lasted.
[234:15.75]Yeah, five hearts before.
[234:16.91]Yeah, but even still, these guys move twice.
[234:19.87]They would have done like five hearts worth of damage.
[234:24.88]The real killer of this one was rolling this.
[234:28.92]And rolling it, not only rolling it once, but rolling it twice.
[234:32.20]And it was bones twice.
[234:34.40]That sucked.
[234:52.48]Hold on.
[234:52.88]I'm not giving up yet.
[234:56.10]Hold on.
[234:56.44]Wait, wait.
[234:56.66]I can do that next turn.
[234:57.64]Wait.
[234:58.46]I'm not giving up yet.
[235:03.53]Aww.
[235:11.62]Hold on.
[235:12.60]One, two, three.
[235:28.47]No... I'm... I don't know.
[235:30.95]I don't know.
[235:31.99]I guess maybe I can do... One... I can do a super bone, but that doesn't matter.
[235:37.52]The bone dream exists a little bit, but not really.
[235:43.64]Wait.
[235:44.23]Maybe it does.
[235:44.69]Because then I can club.
[235:45.65]Club.
[235:45.89]I'm still dead.
[235:47.77]Move bottom row.
[235:55.20]One, two, three.
[235:55.82]Okay, if I go like this, then that's one, two, three.
[235:59.86]One, two, three.
[236:00.98]I got two wilds.
[236:04.62]No.
[236:06.92]Do seven teeth instead.
[236:09.82]And then heal.
[236:18.61]Hold on.
[236:21.63]I can't get 17th this round.
[236:23.65]Can I?
[236:24.51]No.
[236:24.83]I can't get 7.
[236:26.09]Can I get enough to heal once?
[236:29.99]I get the two wilds.
[236:32.36]So if I go like this, over, so then that's wild, wild.
[236:37.60]I need to like, squish my eyes for a second.
[236:42.18]I have 7 bones, but that's not going to help me.
[236:43.72]I don't want to die.
[236:47.13]Bottom left row.
[236:49.23]Yeah, but the 7 bones don't hurt these guys.
[236:53.22]The seven teeth allows me to get a full heart.
[236:59.41]If I do seven bones, I could swing twice, right?
[237:03.65]I got three wilds.
[237:05.35]Yeah.
[237:07.97]Bones let me whack, but bones don't heal me.
[237:09.87]And if one thing touches me, I'm dead.
[237:13.97]Can I do seven twice?
[237:17.35]I need a defensive combo.
[237:20.23]Yeah, I need the 17th.
[237:21.39]I've got to do a defensive combo.
[237:23.15]I've got to bring the hammer down.
[237:26.31]Heal a full heart.
[237:28.85]Alright, let's go.
[237:29.99]I'm fucking excited.
[237:31.29]Here we go.
[237:31.67]Ready?
[237:33.27]We got... 1, 2, 3.
[237:36.53]1, 2, 3.
[237:39.67]Bring this one down.
[237:42.03]Wild in the middle.
[237:43.65]Wait, don't even have to do this.
[237:45.39]Wild... No, don't do that.
[237:51.63]I don't want to use the moves, though.
[237:55.13]Because if I use my moves, then I... I'm saying wild in the middle here, and then over it, and then down?
[238:07.98]No.
[238:10.94]It's like... Wilds are better than the moves.
[238:16.30]I could do wild here, wild here, and then drag this one in.
[238:20.97]I think that's what I'm doing.
[238:25.01]That's what I'm doing.
[238:26.83]Wild, wild, bring this down.
[238:31.45]If I drop this one down, then I could... but it's the same thing happens.
[238:35.22]So I could do there, and then wild on the left, wild in the middle.
[238:43.67]That'll do it.
[238:44.99]That's one less move.
[238:45.77]Yeah, that's true.
[238:46.23]Okay.
[238:51.33]Wait a minute.
[238:52.83]Okay.
[238:56.16]Give me the heal.
[238:59.36]God.
[239:00.08]Okay.
[239:01.38]You all thought I was done.
[239:03.98]Not even close.
[239:06.28]You all thought I was dead.
[239:11.41]But hold on.
[239:13.09]Wait a second.
[239:17.49]I still have to worry about this.
[239:21.54]Now, I do a poo combo in the middle.
[239:30.08]Poo combo in the middle, then heal.
[239:34.26]Yes.
[239:35.20]Drag down, while in the middle, heal.
[239:39.78]Bone kill left.
[239:41.78]I can't kill the one on the left.
[239:43.68]That's what I'm doing.
[239:44.66]If it's wrong, then by God, I don't want to be right.
[239:48.08]I have another move.
[240:04.77]What's the move here?
[240:11.97]re-roll the which one the top row third row right here top row but I lose the heart do I really want to lose these hearts to kill the curse not right okay I got the heart back fuck okay fuck I can do I can sticky I can do I can do a sticky
[240:43.19]Sticky on which one is the question?
[240:48.97]This is tough now.
[240:53.94]Sticky the one on the left.
[240:54.88]Alright.
[240:59.30]What do you got now?
[241:00.00]What am I destroying?
[241:00.92]What do I need to do?
[241:02.04]I got a seven bone scenario coming up, but it don't matter.
[241:04.90]But it does matter.
[241:06.18]Seven bone scenario is increasing odds here.
[241:09.15]But I don't want to do that.
[241:09.83]I want to whack...
[241:12.32]Which, re-roll something else.
[241:13.72]Hop out, re-roll the top row.
[241:26.26]The second row?
[241:28.32]Re-roll the second row.
[241:31.58]Destroy two, three.
[241:37.26]What a good idea that was from that person that said that.
[241:40.96]Now what?
[241:49.05]I can't do seven bones.
[241:51.05]It's not possible.
[241:53.51]I can't do eight bones.
[241:54.59]I can do bones twice!
[241:56.09]Okay.
[241:58.47]Now.
[241:59.79]Destroy two three?
[242:01.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[242:03.07]That's not a good idea.
[242:05.61]Destroy the teeth.
[242:08.06]Talking about like up here.
[242:10.06]I fucked it up?
[242:11.48]How did I fuck it up?
[242:11.98]What are you talking about?
[242:14.00]Destroy this one here is what I'm thinking.
[242:19.20]I've got nine bones.
[242:24.08]Destroy one bone.
[242:27.18]I don't know what to do.
[242:32.48]This poop gets rid of this bone.
[242:34.28]Alright, shh.
[242:36.24]This poop gets rid of this bone.
[242:39.64]No, this one gets rid of this bone.
[242:42.16]It doesn't get rid of this one, right?
[242:46.30]Break the first bone on the left.
[242:49.09]I don't think that, is that a good idea?
[242:50.71]This one, he won't break this one?
[242:52.48]Why?
[242:56.06]Middle tooth gives you four bones.
[243:01.04]Do not.
[243:01.44]You guys, I'm trying to, there's a lot of knowledge in this chat flying around.
[243:09.51]Three, one?
[243:10.37]Did this one here?

[243:45.80]Good.
[243:46.20]I'm just gonna go.
[243:47.24]We're done.
[243:47.88]I'm not gonna reroll the second row, because then I don't want to lose this.
[244:00.31]But, wait, hold on.
[244:01.14]I only have two turns!
[244:13.02]Think about the order.
[244:15.44]Other one first.
[244:16.14]This is gonna complete that.
[244:17.00]It'll... What do you mean, other one first?
[244:29.92]Yeah, this... That's what I'm doing.
[244:38.73]I know, left first.
[244:39.37]I'm not doing right first.
[244:41.01]I'm doing the seven.
[244:41.79]I'm not gonna do the right one first.
[244:43.05]That'll make four.
[245:00.36]Okay, I got two swings.
[245:04.43]Oh, no.
[245:05.55]What do I do?
[245:06.61]Kill the one.
[245:07.37]This is three damage.
[245:08.25]I can kill one of them.
[245:14.88]I'm gonna kill the one on the right first.
[245:19.26]Oh, my fucking god.
[245:20.38]I just got a crit.
[245:21.96]Give me two crits.
[245:23.14]Give me two crits and we're good.
[245:24.96]We're good.
[245:30.62]Oh my god, I can't believe it.
[245:31.90]Did we just do it?
[245:33.42]I think we actually just did it.
[245:35.48]Don't fuck it up.
[245:44.88]Did I do it wrong?
[245:49.40]Um... Wild?
[245:51.92]Two wilds.
[245:54.46]I can... Okay, we're gonna do bone.
[245:55.88]I win!
[245:56.44]I win!
[245:56.74]It's over!
[245:57.14]I win!
[246:00.64]Oh, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[246:02.12]Okay, no, we're fine.
[246:02.80]Everything's good.
[246:10.28]Everything's fine?
[246:15.11]No, everything's okay.
[246:21.89]Kill one before I do anything.
[246:28.56]Now I can do... I can heal.
[246:31.48]Let's heal.
[246:34.20]Two wilds.
[246:35.32]Bang.
[246:35.88]Bang.
[246:37.00]That lets me heal.
[246:37.74]I think that's the fucking idea here.
[246:42.89]Wait.
[246:43.41]Wild the hearts.
[246:45.11]Only one wild necessary for the hearts.
[246:48.61]You're talking about, talking about, talking about.
[246:50.33]What are you talking about here?
[246:51.21]Talking about going like this.
[246:53.15]What do you mean?
[246:58.55]Teeth heal.
[246:59.27]What?
[247:00.15]Get hearts.
[247:02.93]There's a whole cafeteria of people screaming different scenarios at me.
[247:07.28]And I have my own scenarios.
[247:09.14]But you guys are doing a great job helping me.
[247:12.34]I love it.
[247:16.83]I only have one wild, so not two wilds.
[247:18.97]So therefore, we're going to do the teeth.
[247:22.99]Because I can wild this, bring this up.
[247:26.23]Which then, that means I can use this.
[247:27.95]But does that work?
[247:34.49]Do poop.
[247:38.81]Because then, oh, I can just get mana, you mean.
[247:43.96]Play safe and make a poop.
[247:46.86]Poops.
[247:47.22]3-1 poop, 3-2 wild.
[248:09.09]I gotta like turn this music off.
[248:10.95]It's like stressful music.
[248:12.19]It's hard for me to even think.
[248:13.23]4-2 wild.
[248:16.73]Make a poop.
[248:17.49]4-2 wild.
[248:20.42]So you want me to go right here with a wild and then drag this guy over.
[248:25.34]And make a poop and drop it.
[248:36.68]And then I'm re-rolling.
[248:38.88]I don't even know what the fuck I want to reroll.
[248:44.17]Make a tooth.
[248:48.65]Reroll number four.
[248:53.01]Tooth and heal.
[249:01.83]Good play.
[249:05.98]Now reroll... bottom row.
[249:10.36]Raise him.
[249:23.61]Get ready for next round.
[249:28.72]In fact... Delete teeth for the bone.
[249:52.04]I need bones, you're right.
[249:54.28]I just, like, burped.
[249:58.32]Okay, I'm good.
[249:59.38]I did it.
[249:59.90]Game over.
[250:00.46]I win.
[250:08.09]I can't believe I have full health right now.
[250:17.37]Holy shit, I can't believe... I can't believe... I'm gonna say I did that, but... It was like... 21... 22% me, like... 81% you.
[250:27.84]Like, it's 78%.
[250:29.12]You gain a soul heart, that's pretty good.
[250:30.66]Reroll next row of tiles.
[250:37.79]I didn't even do anything.
[250:38.99]PogChamp.
[250:42.23]Yeah, I want the soul heart.
[250:47.03]I don't... I don't want this.
[250:52.26]This is it.
[250:53.34]Bumbo versus Gizzarda.
[250:55.98]She's... I got full health.
[251:02.34]Cannot do spells, by the way.
[251:05.98]Very important to know.
[251:12.48]Can only beat this with attacks.
[251:19.64]So... I can do... We can do a big goop here.
[251:26.28]Get a seven bone lined up.
[251:29.10]Alright, let me first... Let's go up.
[251:31.10]And then... Let's just goop.

[251:45.07]It's two.
[251:45.75]Always.
[251:46.05]Alright.
[251:47.35]Now...

[255:11.15]Maybe I have to beat the game like 10 times or something.
[255:16.59]Alright, let's see.
[255:17.11]Bumble the weird.
[255:19.82]When they kill, they gain movement.

[256:16.43]No.
[256:18.39]Can I get back to the main menu from here?
[256:20.65]It's before character select.
[256:21.99]I guess I can just quit, right?
[256:37.00]There was a bad bug in the sound settings, so they had to take it up before release.
[256:40.50]Oh, okay.

[260:13.03]Right there.
[260:13.83]Right down the middle.
[260:15.64]I think that's a good idea.
[260:16.94]Yep.
[260:19.14]And then we're gonna go... Hmm.
[260:21.06]What do you think, Kirby?
[260:22.42]I think we're gonna move this up and prepare for a big one.
[260:24.74]What do you think?
[260:25.90]Sounds pretty good idea.
[260:28.07]Thanks, man.
[260:34.71]Hmm.
[260:54.16]This is three damage, but what?
[261:00.70]Can I just take out the middle?
[261:01.70]Why not?
[261:03.54]So they don't attack me and kill me.
[261:06.48]Adds more of a selected tile.
[261:07.87]Oh, what's that?
[261:08.69]We're going to pick bone.
[261:10.39]Hey, look at that.
[261:12.43]Ooh.
[261:12.75]Ooh.
[261:24.09]Don't fuck it up.
[261:28.44]That looks kind of good to me.
[261:32.12]What do I care though?
[261:53.08]I screwed it up.
[261:54.66]This music is chilling me out too much.
[261:56.64]Removes tiles and throws them.
[262:12.42]Wait.
[262:19.66]I'm getting moves.
[262:22.16]Every time I throw something, do I move?
[262:25.68]Which tile do I want to throw?
[262:26.80]The poo?
[262:29.39]The... What am I... Oh my god.
[262:35.37]How many times do I get to do this?
[262:38.81]Move on kill right.

[262:53.28]Oh my god.
[262:54.46]Move on kill.

[262:58.46]This character is ridiculous.

[263:23.98]That's so powerful.
[263:27.62]Oh, music's gone.
[263:28.36]Sorry.
[263:29.16]How about Metroid?
[263:31.16]Relaxing and ambient music from Metroid.
[263:37.15]Blocks the next two attacks.
[263:38.13]Move a tile row one to the right.
[263:39.91]It blocks the next two attacks.
[263:49.41]The buzz looks pretty crazy.
[263:50.85]Boogers sink.
[263:51.45]That's a good idea.
[263:56.68]okay we just need to kill one so I'm thinking tooth no hold on yeah let's get tooth that should lead us into a okay
[264:24.43]Adds more of a selected tile.
[264:25.55]We're gonna go with, uh... We're gonna go with, uh, bones.
[264:30.69]Okay.
[264:31.47]Bring that down.
[264:33.67]Keep up the killing spree.
[264:37.90]And... we gotta do it again.
[264:39.66]Removes a tile.
[264:41.10]So let's get rid of this one.
[264:43.54]And throw it this way.
[264:48.53]What are you gonna do, huh?
[264:54.57]What a room full of shitty enemies.
[264:56.21]Alright, I don't want to get too cocky.
[265:07.87]I think that's pretty much it.
[265:13.72]I can do... No, I can do this.
[265:22.71]Play Half-Life music in honor of Half-Life VR.
[265:30.48]Like I could.
[265:31.08]But will I?
[265:40.61]No.
[265:53.33]Just add more hearts?
[265:55.63]Yeah, I mean, this is kind of doing well for me now.
[266:07.51]Turn 1 kill.
[266:11.27]I feel like, um... Bumbo the Weird might need a little bit of extra tuning.
[266:19.48]Seems very, very, very, very good.
[266:25.42]So, what's with these rooms?
[266:26.88]Is this designed around just a bunch of random enemies in a room?
[266:38.65]Okay, let me go... Okay, I'm ready for another one.
[266:56.91]I kind of want to do... Let's throw out... What do I want to throw out?
[267:03.74]This one here.
[267:05.18]Yep, check it.
[267:12.49]And then that allows me to... I don't like this.
[267:19.51]First turn!
[267:20.89]You never get a chance.
[267:24.18]You're not going to get a single chance.
[267:25.80]Although, wait a minute.
[267:28.42]Maybe you do get a chance.
[267:29.50]Do I have a four?
[267:32.54]I could do that.
[267:37.54]Move a tile to the right.
[267:38.78]Hold on.
[267:41.72]This is possible for me to do this.
[267:43.78]Because now I can just move to the right.
[267:48.30]How many times am I going to do this?
[267:49.66]Four times?
[267:52.85]So, move a tile to the right, we're gonna do... Let's get some more bones!
[268:12.83]Um...
[268:22.92]Now we're gonna remove the... This one.
[268:30.26]And kill you.
[268:37.64]I think that's... No, I'm not done.
[268:45.25]What happened?
[268:45.67]What do you mean miss?
[268:49.03]Because I clicked in the wrong section or something?
[269:04.48]I'm just kind of dumb.
[269:08.36]Whatever.
[269:08.68]I ruined it.
[269:12.08]Yeah, I guess if you misclick in the wrong row, it just throws it down the... I guess.
[269:18.17]Okay, whatever.
[269:18.63]Oh, let's go this way.
[269:32.25]Yeah, that's whatever.
[269:33.01]That'll cure him.
[269:41.16]Two.
[269:42.98]Three.
[269:45.86]Middle is empty.
[269:46.50]Yeah.
[269:46.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[269:50.70]Charges random usable item.
[269:54.42]Copies spell at random.
[269:55.46]These both suck.
[270:04.78]Bumbo versus Peeper.
[270:11.40]Alright, let's just pick a tile to throw.
[270:16.13]Well, you made that easy for me.
[270:24.43]Now, let's go like this.
[270:33.04]This is gonna be beautiful.
[270:37.54]Add more of a select tile, and we're gonna go with wilds!
[270:47.38]It removes the tile.
[271:00.01]We're going to remove... What should we remove?
[271:05.12]Probably this here.
[271:05.70]Go again.
[271:13.34]And now we can do the sticky.
[271:18.26]We can do actually a big shticky.
[271:32.28]He ain't going anywhere.
[271:35.10]Move a tile one row to the right.
[271:37.52]Well, if you ask, I'll do it.
[271:47.10]eyes what about the eyes then I'm gonna get a chance this dude's dead I can move to the right and I would get uh no should I do what should I do move what's it right you can do it four times one two three four is that gonna help
[272:13.24]What should I move?
[272:15.36]The teeth.
[272:17.54]The second row?
[272:19.32]Third and fourth rows?
[272:22.16]Oh, would you look at that.
[272:22.96]We're just gonna keep going.
[272:38.68]I'm gonna remove this booger.
[272:43.54]dead that was turn one items are on sale 50% off that's like automatic that's an automatic click alright what do we got spell cost spell hurts more
[273:10.97]This has a question mark around it, but can I actually increase this?
[273:18.43]Or is this a waste?
[273:23.14]It doesn't work.
[273:24.26]It's broken.
[273:25.60]Don't.
[273:25.88]It's not worth it.
[273:27.04]No.
[273:27.32]It's a scam.
[273:27.88]Okay.
[273:32.18]Reroll spell.
[273:35.05]I could reroll this, try to get something better.
[273:36.47]Because this thing sucks.
[273:47.66]That's insane.
[273:49.51]Plus one movement.
[273:51.81]I could... Should I reroll its cost from poop?
[273:57.51]No, I need a poop sink, don't I?
[274:00.33]No, I need a poop sink.
[274:02.31]Spell hurts more.
[274:03.39]That's fine.
[274:03.85]We'll keep that the way it is.
[274:04.71]Let's roll it.
[274:10.18]What do the puzzle pieces mean?
[274:11.38]More spell damage?
[274:16.89]That's really good too.
[274:20.90]Alright, give me a hand on this one.
[274:23.54]More yellow tiles.
[274:28.60]I need this one.
[274:29.58]This one, that's huge.
[274:31.04]This is like, I'm guaranteed to win if I get it.
[274:33.78]If I get this, there's no way I lose the game.
[274:37.18]Left.
[274:39.46]This is too important, I need to pull.
[274:42.87]Yeah, it's way too important.
[274:43.77]I'm sorry.
[274:44.15]Because this is a guarantee.
[274:46.65]Absolute 100%.
[274:47.23]There's no way I lose.
[274:48.45]Okay.
[275:03.25]Give me a hint.
[275:07.45]It's random.
[275:08.53]I know.
[275:09.19]But I don't want it to be my fault.
[275:24.73]Most people are saying left or middle.
[275:26.65]I would probably have said, I'm not going to tell you because I don't want it to be my fault.
[275:29.81]Alright.
[275:37.63]Number one is left, but I'm going to go with right because it's the least.
[275:41.99]God damn it.
[275:42.77]Which one was it?
[275:55.18]It is my fault!
[276:03.29]Should I re-roll the spell's cost on one of these?
[276:06.65]What if I re-roll this and it's like a 2?
[276:27.41]koala brain yeah I know yeah I figured that would have been such like a pog moment though for me sorry we don't need it we don't need it we don't need it we're just gonna kill the thing how many what do I got
[276:41.97]I've got three moves.
[276:43.14]Let's get a bone in here.
[276:44.10]Toss it right up the left side.
[276:47.60]And then we're going to do... Got another move left here.
[276:53.13]We're going to do... Let's see.
[276:55.65]I wonder what I want to do with this one.
[276:58.03]I think we're going to probably do... Up and down.
[277:01.61]Let me see anything.
[277:05.32]Anybody see anything?
[277:06.38]I could line up a pretty good left.
[277:19.15]Set up for a yellow.
[277:20.05]I could do teeth.
[277:30.52]Let's set up teeth.
[277:40.19]This thing's gonna explode on me.
[277:43.57]Okay, I need teeth, and then I'm gonna move.
[277:45.49]I know, here we go.
[277:46.13]I'm gonna go like this, which will be... No, no, what are you, an imbecile?
[277:52.69]Are you dumb?
[277:58.01]Poop is movement.
[277:59.19]Yeah, yep.
[278:00.25]Fuck.
[278:00.77]Yep.
[278:01.51]Oh, hold on.
[278:35.03]That's actually not that good.
[278:50.29]Hold on.
[278:51.23]Okay, I gotta slow down here.
[278:52.51]I have a shitload of teeth.
[278:59.04]Three, three.
[279:00.14]I could do seven.
[279:03.48]teeth and I can kill the fly.
[279:07.80]It fucking hurts.
[279:11.23]Okay, then I'm gonna- I gotta kill this other fly.
[279:14.63]It's screwing me up.
[279:16.93]Get rid of this, uh, bone?
[279:18.79]No, which- how do I make this better?
[279:22.35]Get rid of this bone, right?
[279:24.45]Get rid of the booger right here?
[279:27.39]Booger booger booger booger booger booger booger booger booger booger booger.
[279:32.21]Get rid of this pea.
[279:33.11]Get rid of this booger.
[279:34.42]Get rid of the pea at the top.
[279:35.32]Get rid of the booger.
[279:36.22]Get rid of the pea.
[279:37.72]Get ready to do the poop first.
[279:41.04]Okay.
[279:41.34]Alright.
[279:41.72]I'll... Okay.
[279:51.21]Then we can do... We can do the one movement.
[279:55.29]Booger.
[279:59.68]Remove this tile.
[280:02.50]Bingo.
[280:04.07]Ooh, what's that?
[280:18.56]Now, ooh, I can move.
[280:21.35]Let's move the tiles now.
[280:25.01]Don't waste any moves.
[280:26.19]Why don't I just go like this?
[280:28.24]And then go like this again.
[280:29.38]Get the bone.
[280:31.50]Get my extra turn.
[280:35.28]Now I can remove this tile here, this tooth.
[280:40.13]Because who gives a shit?
[280:42.09]Bingo.
[280:42.69]Throw it.
[280:43.25]We're dead.
[280:44.73]No, you're not.
[280:45.31]I fucking hate this game.
[280:47.49]I hate it.
[280:48.05]Okay.
[280:49.25]I messed up.
[281:06.45]He's so moody.
[281:07.49]I need teeth.
[281:16.65]I'm out of hearts though.
[281:17.67]This is actually not good.
[281:34.87]Let's go.
[281:36.41]I'm an idiot.
[281:37.97]Oh, right.
[281:38.65]I don't lose it between turns.
[281:46.46]I forgot a different character.
[281:56.24]Explode.
[281:59.80]Make the hearts?
[282:00.82]Oh yeah, fuck, I'm too busy.
[282:03.80]Splash back attack?
[282:05.15]Attacking enemies... Attacking enemies take damage or splash back.
[282:09.87]I can't even heal anyways.
[282:16.88]I think the splash back is the one.
[282:25.53]This is a lot of enemies.
[282:26.61]This is a lot.
[282:27.63]Okay, I can't really fuck around now.
[282:29.51]I only have one heart.
[282:37.57]I could set up a huge poop.
[282:38.53]This is what I'm gonna do.
[282:50.66]And then we're gonna do a cheat setup.
[282:55.33]So let's see, what's the best way to do this?
[282:56.67]There's like a bunch of ways I could probably do this.
[283:05.23]I could go this way, go one, two, fuck no.
[283:19.41]Do seven bones instead.
[283:26.76]I actually, I need the seven.
[283:29.02]I need to do the stomp.
[283:33.50]If I get one, two, three.
[283:36.67]One, two, fuck.
[283:41.67]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[283:45.25]Move this one down.
[283:55.00]Bone at the top.
[283:57.48]Bones are good too.
[283:58.40]Yeah, I know, but I have a lot of teeth.
[284:09.55]And then if I go like this... Move you up.
[284:14.61]Wait.
[284:16.56]Okay.
[284:16.66]Okay.
[284:27.49]Yeah, I do with the poop shield.
[284:28.43]That's right.
[284:28.79]This should do it now.
[284:30.19]Alright, so we got seven here.
[284:40.01]Okay.
[284:41.27]They're all dead.
[284:42.13]Good.
[284:44.05]Cool.
[284:45.71]Okay.
[284:46.93]Bones!
[284:52.46]Let's go right down the middle.
[284:57.88]I'm doing it again, because you can only take damage from this shit.
[285:08.23]Alright.
[285:10.27]Let's get a poop.
[285:11.75]On the left side.
[285:14.27]And that allows me to add a movement.
[285:16.83]And I can make more tiles.
[285:18.65]And you know what we're doing.
[285:19.69]I mean, obviously.
[285:20.45]More teeth.
[285:26.18]More teeth.
[285:29.39]So, I could go one, two, grab it.
[285:31.29]I could do a big one here.
[285:33.23]Three.
[285:33.73]Oh, yeah.
[285:34.15]Okay, here we go.
[285:35.77]Let's set it up.
[285:37.27]It's not gonna kill that, but it'll kill these things.
[285:49.72]Okay.
[285:51.78]Bring it down.
[285:54.26]Goodbye.
[285:57.79]Wait, why did it kill that?
[285:59.73]Why did it kill the one that has... Oh, because that's not magic.
[286:04.75]Reduce the cost of your spells or flips a row of tiles.
[286:09.01]This one.
[286:13.71]That means I can just do the more often.
[286:19.65]Alright, second boss.
[286:21.45]Bumbo versus Gibbs.
[286:22.33]This thing was kind of shitty, but I don't want to get cocky.
[286:27.76]Should I even use this?
[286:28.72]No, not yet.
[286:29.58]Alright.
[286:30.51]Oh, what do I want to do?
[286:31.27]Big moves, big moves, big moves.
[286:36.87]Go with extra.
[286:39.64]More tiles.
[286:41.12]Bones.
[286:44.54]Alright.
[286:46.98]Bingo.
[286:47.16]Good game.
[287:01.11]shit hey what do you know splash back attack that was came in pretty useful I guess may gain movement or enemies may take damage moving probably the battery right
[287:33.59]Okay, 21.
[287:33.75]What do we got?
[287:36.32]The spell costs less.
[287:40.56]Which one?
[287:42.36]Remove tile and throw, or add more of a selected tile?
[287:45.18]Probably this one.
[287:47.92]The movement one?
[287:50.63]Well, the piss, this is very difficult.
[287:53.71]This one?
[287:54.47]But I can only do this once a... I think it's this one.
[287:58.17]That'll be two, man.
[288:00.03]The marker...
[288:08.89]Imagine how many times I'd be able to use this.
[288:10.61]Probably twice in one turn.
[288:13.95]It'll be two and three.
[288:16.37]It'll be two and three.
[288:20.13]Okay, we're gonna go marker.
[288:22.83]Spell hurts more.
[288:25.56]Not worth it.
[288:28.40]Reroll the spell.
[288:38.48]But I'm going to use bones for this.
[288:47.21]It's too expensive.
[288:52.79]Well, I'm going to get one of them.
[288:58.01]Spell hurt more on one?
[288:59.01]I thought I couldn't do that.
[289:00.47]Alright.
[289:09.70]Puzzle damage up.
[289:10.96]Oh, fuck.
[289:19.47]Are we certain that this doesn't work?
[289:23.37]That's really good.
[289:24.03]I'm just gonna do it to splash back then.
[289:26.29]Why am I not gonna reroll the spell?
[289:32.71]What just happened?
[289:38.63]How many times has that happened?
[289:43.36]Okay, that's the third time in a row that I've re-rolled something into the same number that it was already.
[289:53.86]Damn it.
[289:54.28]How is that even possible?
[289:56.12]One coin.
[289:56.72]Let's go.
[289:58.48]See if I can beat this.
[290:01.27]You increased the damage, not re-rolled.
[290:03.29]Oh, but why does it still say two?
[290:05.11]It's because I re-rolled the damage to two.
[290:13.15]Damage went from 2 to 2.
[290:15.52]Alright, this is important.
[290:18.02]This is the one I gotta win.
[290:21.02]We need better music than this.
[290:22.56]Something a little more upbeat.
[290:25.56]But not too upbeat that I'm gonna get nervous.
[290:34.86]Insane Aquarium OST.
[290:37.26]No, that'll drive people crazy.
[290:43.92]WWE entrance music I like it okay wwf entrance music oh no these are all the vods yeah this is bad I can't do that goodbye VOD viewers I can't do that um Binding of Isaac OST
[291:16.50]Kata Mario.
[291:17.26]We just did that two days in a row.
[291:21.33]Not Banjo-Kazooie.
[291:24.37]Metal Slug?
[291:25.49]Now that's one of... Metal Slug OST.
[291:36.84]Good choice.
[291:42.12]Alright, move one.
[291:42.96]We're gonna throw... We're gonna do... I say we're gonna go up with the... I don't know.
[291:49.14]I have no idea.
[291:49.66]Can you play for me?
[291:55.64]Wait, what?
[291:58.32]Was this me?
[291:59.89]Going like... Turn on the clicks?
[292:06.27]No, no, no, no.
[292:08.82]Here we go.
[292:09.18]Watch this.
[292:09.64]This might be a poor decision, but I'm going for it.
[292:11.78]I don't care.
[292:12.91]Don't fuck it up.
[292:14.65]I want the more tiles.
[292:17.47]Because we're gonna do teeth.
[292:23.11]Set us up.
[292:24.55]It's set up.
[292:28.43]And I get to drop poop right here.
[292:32.95]Oh, what's that?
[292:33.49]Look at me.
[292:51.51]That's fine.
[292:52.47]Alright, now.
[292:54.19]Bone.
[292:55.47]Uh, yeah, bone into... Oh, should I slow?
[292:58.25]Maybe I'll drop a poo over here.
[292:59.91]Just to be safe.
[293:01.53]Look at how many moves I have.
[293:02.75]Holy fuck.
[293:14.20]Uh, I... I have to kill you with this spell.
[293:17.14]So let me get some bones and some teeth.
[293:18.65]I just need bones.
[293:24.48]And that's... I mean, I can't even hurt you, so... Let's throw a puzzle at you.
[293:33.09]Let's get rid of... This one here.
[293:36.17]There you go.
[293:37.98]Goodbye.
[293:41.08]Now, I kind of just have to wait until you open.
[293:47.25]Should I just...
[293:50.40]How am I supposed to do?
[293:51.16]Okay, add more bones.
[293:53.48]Or teeth.
[293:54.82]Okay, now... Just set up seven of them.
[294:00.08]I can take as long as I want.
[294:09.49]Set up seven hearts.
[294:11.13]I can't do that.
[294:14.89]Do hearts instead?
[294:18.15]I wonder if we should just farm hearts right now?
[294:20.63]Alright, well I can't.
[294:22.17]No, I can't.
[294:34.28]He's dead!
[294:35.96]He used the marker, but I... Next time.
[294:49.76]Poopy Morph attack.
[294:52.49]Or gain gray mana.
[294:57.89]Uh... This is... Wait, this is not even Original Metal Slug.
[295:02.57]Where's Metal... Where's Original Metal Slug?
[295:08.83]Oh, this is like a compilation.
[295:10.01]Alright, look.
[295:10.89]This is... Original Metal Slug is right here.
[295:12.37]There we... Okay.
[295:14.49]Here's Original Metal Slug.
[295:17.27]Okay, um...
[295:26.11]I wonder which one of these is even worth doing.
[295:30.43]Poop?
[295:30.79]Maybe the Poopy Morph attack?
[295:33.87]I'll take it.
[295:34.51]No, but what do I want to get rid of?
[295:36.33]I just upgraded this, didn't I?
[295:37.71]No, I didn't.
[295:39.41]Um... Get rid of Splashback?
[295:48.56]I don't think I'm taking... No, should I not take anything?
[295:53.86]Splashback might be good later.
[295:56.66]No, I'm not gonna take it.
[295:57.58]How do I just get out of this?
[295:58.42]I don't think I can leave.
[296:06.74]I can't cancel.
[296:11.50]I'll replace Splashback.
[296:13.24]That's a little too much, because I'm gonna be using it for tiles.
[296:20.88]What are these guys?
[296:21.40]I don't know what these guys do.
[296:27.27]Okay, we're looking for... First of all, very important, get the P. What do I want more of?
[296:35.05]I have a double move.
[296:37.53]Alright, let's do Pooh then.
[296:45.25]Right down the middle.
[296:47.65]And then let's get... I want to add more bones.
[296:56.11]Fuck.
[296:56.67]Didn't want to do that.
[296:57.47]Didn't want that to happen.
[297:00.35]Oh, fuck.
[297:02.11]Maybe I did.
[297:18.26]Ooh.
[297:23.44]Play this whole row.
[297:25.45]Another move.
[297:26.25]This is four damage.
[297:27.53]Alright, keep clearing it.
[297:29.69]I'm alright with this.
[297:32.85]Can I kill this guy without doing anything?
[297:34.61]Let's see if I can kill him.
[297:43.65]Okay, let's add more teeth.
[297:50.62]That should be enough to at least move a little bit.
[297:53.54]Get rid of the boogers.
[297:58.89]Beat him with a zero.
[298:00.01]Remove boogers now.
[298:03.09]Alright.
[298:15.38]Okay, this is a lot.
[298:16.78]I need to slow down.
[298:17.52]I have way too many teeth.
[298:23.21]Three.
[298:24.51]If I move... I'm just gonna keep this rolling.
[298:31.29]Alright, now I'm gonna get hearts.
[298:34.11]Do poopy mouth.
[298:35.19]Not yet.
[298:38.35]I'm just gonna keep killing shit.
[298:52.78]Okay, hearts.
[298:58.06]Now, let's do tile remove.
[299:02.21]On this one, on the bone.
[299:04.15]No, let's do this one.
[299:06.85]Just whip it right down the middle.
[299:11.35]And then... Do it again.
[299:15.62]Do it to this.
[299:18.36]I think I don't have any idea what I'm doing right now.
[299:21.28]How about the poop over here?
[299:22.44]Or the bone?
[299:24.28]Okay.
[299:24.80]I don't know.
[299:25.68]Alright.
[299:29.95]Alright.
[299:31.04]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven hearts!
[299:34.90]Seven of them.
[299:36.54]Don't screw it up.
[299:38.54]This needs to move.
[299:49.13]This needs to move.
[299:49.81]Um... Uh-oh.
[299:56.40]Hold on, I, I, this is wrong for me.
[299:59.08]How do I get this to be right?
[300:11.07]It's almost... It's close.
[300:12.21]Kind of.
[300:13.53]Just take your time.
[300:17.05]Okay.
[300:18.79]And then this is going to come over here.
[300:20.15]I'm just going to take my time.
[300:25.37]Yeah.
[300:26.27]I'm going to take my time.
[300:37.97]Now... Why do I have one move?
[300:40.69]Okay, now this is... I need three over here, so move you here.
[300:48.78]And then... That's close.
[300:55.22]So now I go up, up, up.
[300:57.41]And then I can move that one to the left.
[300:59.67]One more on the bottom.
[301:01.45]What do you mean?
[301:05.57]Move wild to the middle with the spell.
[301:12.36]I see what you're saying.
[301:20.07]There we go.
[301:27.65]All of this just to get an extra soul heart.
[301:31.21]I hope it was worth it.
[301:32.07]There we go.
[301:42.13]Cool.
[301:44.29]COOL!
[301:48.75]Alright, now, uh, whatever, just... Gotta hit it once.
[301:55.19]Another move, I just need to kill it.
[301:59.35]Uh... Just... Who cares.
[302:10.05]No, I wanna try to bring this up.
[302:14.09]Dead.
[302:14.35]Alright, now I have two hearts.
[302:18.43]I think I have one more room and then that's the boss after this.
[302:25.72]I already have a good scenario here for a... I got already.
[302:29.74]Already.
[302:32.26]Bring this one down.
[302:34.26]Bring this one down.
[302:39.14]Already.
[302:41.13]If I could fucking care less, whatever you guys do.
[302:47.65]Good night.
[302:51.96]Oh, fucking hell yeah.
[302:53.60]Alright, don't blow it.
[302:58.28]Destroy a row of tiles or plus three movement and a random mana.
[303:01.88]That's the one.
[303:04.52]Yeah.
[303:05.90]What do I replace it?
[303:06.74]I'm gonna... Yeah.
[303:07.93]The heart's gone.
[303:09.29]Why is the heart gone?
[303:10.03]What happened to the heart?
[303:15.07]They exploded?
[303:17.44]No.
[303:19.02]It was the fly.
[303:21.73]Alright, we'll have a Mega Battery.
[303:23.35]And we're gonna just get rid of the Poopy Morph Attack.
[303:28.51]This is it.
[303:30.23]Alright, Bumbo versus Pyre.
[303:31.73]Matching specific color tiles is the key.
[303:38.14]Alright, I need to match yellow.
[303:41.60]Battery right off the bat.
[303:45.49]I think I'm doing battery both these right off the bat.
[303:53.76]Okay.
[303:54.56]I have a lot of time to think about this.
[303:56.30]So we need to do yellow tiles.
[304:02.15]Do 7P.
[304:03.59]Is that possible right now?
[304:06.13]I could go here.
[304:14.62]This is going to take a lot of movement here.
[304:18.08]No, I'm not going to go for it.
[304:19.25]We're just going to do one, two.
[304:30.85]Now what?
[304:31.79]Now is he hurt?
[304:38.82]Add more of his... Alright, is this teeth?
[304:44.28]Okay, um, hold on.
[304:45.67]Now he's hurt.
[304:48.73]Teeth?
[304:49.55]How many teeth do I have?
[304:52.71]Seven teeth.
[304:53.41]Let's go.
[304:54.47]I can do... One, two, three.
[304:57.05]One, two, three.
[304:58.11]No, hold on.
[304:59.97]Do this first.
[305:05.08]Okay.
[305:07.10]Okay.
[305:08.78]Crush him!
[305:13.20]Ooh, that one stings.
[305:16.50]Alright, hold on.
[305:21.47]More of what?
[305:22.43]Poop?
[305:27.75]More boogers.
[305:28.39]More bones.
[305:30.61]Hold on, because I need to make sure I'm protected.
[305:34.55]If I get hit once or twice, I'm dead.
[305:40.03]Bones, okay.
[305:40.97]Alright, let's do it.
[305:44.54]Not a great position, but it's enough for me to at least... Let's see.
[305:50.40]If I go... I'm just going to do one, and then... Can I do seven?
[306:00.62]Can I?
[306:00.96]I have two moves.
[306:09.06]Okay, I could do bang, bang.
[306:11.09]Is that enough?
[306:12.25]This...
[306:14.45]Down.
[306:15.19]Down.
[306:15.47]This is it.
[306:18.59]No, it's not.
[306:20.94]Use the spell to move it once.
[306:21.90]Down.
[306:26.62]Down.
[306:26.98]That's it!
[306:49.60]And with him final bit of punch bumble smash big bad guy into bits
[307:01.08]That character's really powerful.
[307:03.86]That reminds me of Azazel.
[307:07.06]Original Azazel.
[307:08.28]And the basement has been unlocked.
[307:36.96]The trapdoor.
[307:43.02]Let me see.
[307:43.54]Did I unlock anybody else?
[307:45.64]Bumble the brave.
[307:46.46]Bumble the nimble.
[307:47.27]Bumble the stout.
[307:48.63]Bumble the weird.
[307:50.33]Beat the game with the weird.
[307:57.79]How come I don't get this character?
[308:06.79]Do I have to beat it with the fourth floor?
[308:09.71]You didn't have to beat the basement with Bumbo the Weird.
[308:19.69]You just moved the goalpost forward.
[308:27.11]Hurry up and speedrun it.
[308:31.81]There's a door there now?
[308:32.85]Yeah.
[308:34.44]So did I just do the equivalent of you beat mom like five times or whatever?
[308:38.54]And now the video game starts?
[308:43.55]Yeah.
[308:44.69]That's fucking awesome.
[308:48.51]That's cool.
[308:50.87]Only 20 more times did you get the real ending.
[308:56.10]Except it's not that much more content yet.
[309:04.10]I think it's fun.
[309:06.08]Does it have the staying power of something like Binding of Isaac?
[309:08.94]Probably not, but it is a cool little game.
[309:20.99]He hates it?
[309:21.49]No, I think it's great.
[309:24.19]I don't think I'm gonna do... I mean, I would probably play this.
[309:29.93]It's early access?
[309:33.45]You sure?
[309:39.88]It's not early access.
[309:43.33]No, this is released.
[309:49.81]This is definitely one of those games that you just kind of play when you're just chilling like we've done today.
[309:55.29]I would play the fuck out of this on my iPad.
[309:56.83]Oh, I would too.
[309:57.35]I think that's coming.
[310:00.15]That's coming soon.
[310:05.71]Well, soon as in, who knows how long that'll take.
[310:08.09]I know it's supposed to be coming out on the Switch or something.
[310:14.07]But I think it was pretty good.
[310:19.39]Yeah, that's another thing.
[310:20.33]Another really important thing to remember about this game, when Binding of Isaac released, which is 1.0, it didn't have the thousand plus items that are in it now.
[310:39.71]I'm sure that over the years, there'll probably be at least a couple of major additions to it.
[310:46.48]It was on Newgrounds in 2008 with two floors.
[310:49.36]Yeah.
[310:51.36]I think it's great.
[310:52.06]I think it's 13, it's like 14 bucks.
[311:00.31]I think it's worth your time.
[311:05.30]But this isn't a free game on Newgrounds.
[311:07.04]No, I think it's worth it.
[311:08.40]I think it's worth like the $13, $14.
[311:09.49]I mean, I've been playing this game for over five hours now and it's... There's still more to do.
[311:19.81]It's a game that you're just supposed to play through like 30, 40 times in a row.
[311:35.44]We'll see.
[311:40.67]But you didn't.
[311:42.31]Well, not yet.
[311:45.49]It's got bad Steam reviews.
[311:48.35]It's kind of mixed, I guess.
[311:49.73]People are mad about the bugs that were there last week.
[311:56.02]Which, I mean, that's completely understandable.
[311:57.90]If the game crashes in the middle of your run, that's kind of... That sucks.
[312:02.62]That sucks.
[312:08.21]But once they patch it a bunch of times, and it's the game that they kind of, I guess, should have released a week or a half ago or so, a week ago.
[312:19.11]I would say if you want to wait till... I mean, it's 10% off right now.
[312:24.95]If you like what you saw, then you liked what you saw.
[312:30.50]I think it's an interesting mechanic.
[312:32.54]Did he get softlocked?
[312:33.30]Yeah, I got softlocked.
[312:36.52]I had to go back to the very first save file in Dead Rising 2.
[312:42.42]Is this a sponsored stream?
[312:44.52]Why the hell would I do a sponsored Bumbo stream?
[312:51.96]Yeah, guys, my first ever sponsored stream.
[312:55.56]It's Bumbo.
[313:00.17]No.
[313:02.23]I thought it was cute.
[313:02.91]It was fun.
[313:03.49]It was interesting.
[313:04.98]It's taken a long time, but I mean, it's only like a handful of people that are working on this.
[313:10.92]I thought it was good.
[313:11.94]I liked it.
[313:12.84]And I'm going to play it another time.
[313:15.08]Not on stream.
[313:15.70]I'm going to play it on my own.
[313:19.07]But, guys, no, no, no, don't say it.
[313:24.19]Don't say it.
[313:25.01]Don't say it.
[313:26.33]Guys, don't say it.
[313:28.29]Oh, no, no.
[313:29.29]It's only been five and a half hours.
[313:30.71]Don't say it.
[313:32.50]Guys.
[313:32.88]Uh, I have to go.
[313:41.29]No, but why?
[313:41.91]Why do you have to go?
[313:42.75]What?
[313:43.07]No!
[313:43.49]Dude, come on!
[313:46.00]I am going to go start working on the, uh, Lazy Fuck Sultan.
[313:59.12]What is that?
[313:59.68]What the fuck?
[314:00.60]Oh, come on.
[314:01.62]What does that even mean?
[314:03.26]Liar.
[314:10.29]Alright, let me explain for those of you that are not sure what I'm talking about here.
[314:17.70]Probably the second week of December.
[314:21.11]I'm going to have a series of streams where I have an enormous Minecraft server.
[314:29.08]That's probably going to be the first one.
[314:31.98]And it's going to be Fuck the King.
[314:36.02]I am going to rule over a kingdom with hopefully, potentially hundreds and hundreds of slots on a server.
[314:43.51]It's going to be a kind of slightly RP kind of scenario where if I die...
[314:51.86]It's over.
[314:53.34]The king's dead.
[314:56.42]I am going to collect taxes on you.
[314:59.38]I'm going to have bodyguards.
[315:04.71]Good luck.
[315:06.91]There's going to be an aging system, hopefully, if we can get it coded.
[315:12.35]Where you, if you, so people can't just turtle, you know, like five hours in game or 10 hours in actual game is like, you die, you're dead.
[315:24.55]He thinks the guards will protect him.
[315:26.06]I think they will.
[315:27.52]Oh, they will.
[315:28.08]Because they're going to be all trusted.
[315:29.78]Very, very highly trusted people.
[315:31.56]And I'm going to be surrounded by them.
[315:33.76]There will be grievances with the kingdom.
[315:37.64]You will be expected to make statues of me.
[315:40.88]There will be consequences.
[315:46.37]There's a lot going on.
[315:48.55]Hopefully it's going to be a lot of fun.
[315:52.29]And that's not it.
[315:53.29]There's going to be... This is kind of a series of, like, the streamer is a fucking egomaniac.
[316:00.43]Because as we go forward with other games in that sort of open, no-goal, RP style, I want to do this where I don't do anything.
[316:09.98]I physically do not play the game, and thousands of you just play the game for me.
[316:17.55]I want like 50 diamond blocks and you just bring them to me and I just sit there and we have like cameras that are observers that are going around seeing how people are doing.
[316:32.45]If I'm unhappy, like I'll just make, I'll call a court and we'll decide what we're going to do.
[316:38.29]You need to protect me.
[316:39.21]I'll have loyal, I'll pay, I'll pay in like in-game money.
[316:42.53]We'll have like, try to have like an in-game currency of like, have like mercenaries to protect me and protect the kingdom.
[316:56.24]but there's a lot that needs to go into it and I want to start working on it and get it solid because I need to like buy servers I need to hire some coders I've been talking to uh people like producers for this to try to help get cameras and observer cameras and it's gonna be a whole thing and it's probably gonna be like a four or five week series we'll do it like once a week with probably potentially maybe one or two in Minecraft one or two in like Conan Exiles
[317:27.41]We're just throwing... It's in the phase right now where we're trying to figure it out.
[317:31.85]But I definitely want to have a The Lazy King Sucks stream.
[317:37.35]At least... Probably four or five of them.
[317:45.16]But... I will see you guys in a couple days.
[317:49.68]We will start... I don't know what we're going to start because there's like the Star Wars, which I was like, eh.
[317:56.64]There's like Outer Worlds where I'm like, eh.
[317:59.21]There's PlayStation 1 where I'm like, eh.
[318:02.75]There's a bunch of stuff I could pull from.
[318:13.60]200 people are going to just bum rush you.
[318:17.37]Well, that's... I'm gonna... You guys don't think that I'm gonna have plans?
[318:21.19]What am I, just... Yeah, sure.
[318:24.95]Are you gonna build a ladder and climb up to my tower, into my window, like I said the other day, with, like, an axe in your hand?
[318:29.98]You don't think I'm gonna have sentries?
[318:31.82]Just people ready?
[318:34.04]Oh, did you pay that sentry?
[318:35.88]In the in-game currency?
[318:37.28]To, like, look the other way?
[318:39.04]Oh, that's fine.
[318:39.74]I've got somebody in the bedroom that's standing there at the window, ready for you.
[318:44.02]And he's paid way more than you could ever pay.
[318:51.79]You don't think I'm going to have like a series of like 30 different tunnels built privately?
[318:56.53]That I can always escape?
[318:59.11]And bring like 30 of my most loyal men and women?
[319:04.39]Then you're going to take over the castle?
[319:06.98]Oh yeah?
[319:07.46]You are?
[319:09.56]Don't think so.
[319:10.88]And I'm going to be a good king.
[319:12.18]I'm not going to be mean to you.
[319:14.28]At least, unless you don't do what I say, then come on.
[319:17.56]I'm the king.
[319:18.26]I'm the king.
[319:24.94]You're going to be Lord Farquaad.
[319:26.62]Somebody said this the other day.
[319:29.76]I've been laughing about it ever since.
[319:33.00]It's like everyone has you build up your houses.
[319:36.02]We have like a series of houses and people populate them and role play and walk around and
[319:43.52]give bring me things and like somebody just pulls out an enchanted arrow and shoots me in the fucking head during one of these like tell me your grievances and I'm instantly dead it's over and it's like all the work was for nothing but that makes me laugh so I don't care you're gonna get like we're gonna check that what your items to see what you have you can't come into the throne room with like an enchanted bow what am I gonna let that happen
[320:14.10]There's going to be metal detectors that you have to go through before you come to the throne room.
[320:24.07]But anyways.
[320:27.52]Once an idea pops, like, into my brain.
[320:29.28]And the original idea, for those of you that weren't here, was WoW Classic.
[320:34.96]Where I didn't want to play WoW Classic because I was grilled about, hey, why the fuck didn't you make the guild?
[320:41.36]You should have made that guild that you promised.
[320:43.20]And I said, I got to level 7 and quit the game because it was stupid.
[320:45.82]I didn't like it, right?
[320:46.94]I don't want to do this again.
[320:47.80]Why do I want to play WoW Classic again?
[320:49.71]Right?
[320:50.55]I was gonna make a guild, and then it was like, well, if I play WoW Classic anyways, people are just gonna, there's gonna be like a hundred people around me, just like all bringing me shit and like killing each other.
[321:01.15]And I was like, I'm not even gonna play the game.
[321:02.39]I was walking around like looking at stuff.
[321:03.89]And then I was like, alright, well, fucking I'll do it.
[321:06.85]And if I die, then stream's over.
[321:09.11]And then it was like, okay, well, that's incentive for people to like protect me and then people to kill me.
[321:12.69]And then it's like, alright, fuck it it.
[321:14.79]I'm not gonna do anything.
[321:17.22]I want like 50,000 gold and the best balance in the game.
[321:20.28]And if I'm hurt, the stream's over.
[321:25.12]And then it kind of just piled on top of that.
[321:27.78]And decided maybe WoW is probably not the best idea.
[321:30.81]It might still be funny to do that as one of the weeks.
[321:34.41]We'll see.
[321:41.65]Five minute stream once a week.
[321:43.71]Well, that wouldn't be the only thing I'd be doing.
[321:46.41]That would just be like, you know, Saturday night is the... Fuck the King, you know what I mean?
[321:51.96]That's like what we do on like Saturdays for a few weeks.
[321:59.22]Fuck the King Friday.
[322:00.46]I just see all these scenarios.
[322:08.10]Where I'm, like, trying to escape from my tunnel.
[322:09.97]Like, okay, we get overrun.
[322:11.03]This castle gets taken.
[322:12.27]Okay, they've risen up and they've taken over.
[322:14.73]And I go through one of my tunnels.
[322:17.05]And I, like, pop out.
[322:18.59]I have to, like, dig up.
[322:20.20]Because, like, I'm sorry.
[322:21.02]There's, like, five of my loyal bodyguards.
[322:22.82]And we're, like, fucking escaping.
[322:24.26]And I dig up.
[322:25.00]And I'm, like, we get stuck and get lost.
[322:27.44]And there's, like, a hundred people surrounding me.
[322:28.92]Like, me popping my head like a prairie dog.
[322:38.36]You don't think I'm gonna have, like, fucking dragons and shit?
[322:43.12]Good luck.
[322:45.58]Or you could just be civil!
[322:47.42]And just, we could be in the kingdom, and who cares?
[322:50.00]I don't need to die.
[322:50.82]But that's it.
[323:01.91]We're gonna probably try to come up with some incentives to why I would not be dead.
[323:10.22]You know, why, why protect me?
[323:11.68]What would you, what do you gain from that?
[323:14.54]Spitballing ideas for that sounds fun.
[323:19.45]And then there's like other factions that arise of people that want to take over.
[323:22.87]They might even be fighting between the viewers.
[323:26.05]And I have nothing to do with it.
[323:27.04]I step in and I'm just like, trying to like correct it.
[323:39.92]Music.
[323:40.34]Ah, shit.
[323:42.18]But that was Legend of Bumble.
[323:43.12]I just wanted to play it for a few hours and ended up playing it for more than five.
[323:45.68]I think it's very fun.
[323:51.29]You let me lie in bed with that and I'll play it every night for at least a few weeks.
[324:07.64]Any interest in Halo Reach?
[324:10.12]When it comes out... Yeah, I'm gonna probably play all of them.
[324:15.10]That seems like a really just fun thing to do, because I've never played any of the Halo games.
[324:19.85]That just seems like a no-brainer.
[324:24.23]But... Let's go back to... Five and a half hours ago, we had... Martin had a meme, gave a thousand bits.
[324:32.16]Thank you, Martin.
[324:35.55]Jerma, you got a nice looking bumbo.
[324:37.29]Haha, just kidding.
[324:39.35]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[324:40.89]Appreciate it.
[324:42.95]By the way, for those of you wondering, I will be back on Thursday.
[324:54.34]Thursday afternoon.
[325:00.07]Pepe hands.
[325:02.43]He hates us.
[325:04.96]You guys go right to that every single time.
[325:07.81]I had a lot of fun today.
[325:08.83]Thanks for helping me.
[325:13.67]It was just chill.
[325:14.93]It was just fun.
[325:15.47]It was stressful sometimes, but that was just fun.
[325:17.71]I'm going to play more puzzle games with you guys.
[325:20.39]He hates Bumbo.
[325:28.62]No, but thank you, seriously.
[325:29.84]Dude, Martin had a meme for a thousand bits.
[325:31.18]Appreciate it.
[325:36.06]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[325:37.74]Jerma, how are you?
[325:38.54]I'm doing pretty good.
[325:40.26]I want to ask you a question.
[325:41.22]Maybe it might be dumb, but I guess I just kind of want to know.
[325:43.64]Do you ever think about your view count while streaming?
[325:46.32]Like, if it goes below a certain number, does it bother you?
[325:49.02]Anyways, hope you're well.
[325:49.84]Have a good night.
[325:51.46]No.
[325:52.54]Not at all.
[325:56.04]The view count on this stream fluctuates huge.
[326:02.07]Because...
[326:04.36]If there's a big event stream, you know, let's say like once a month, some months every like 30 to 40 days, there's like, oh, wow, there's an event.
[326:12.16]Like the Halloween stream, or the carnival, or the green screen stuff.
[326:15.70]I mean, there might be 8, 10, 12,000 people concurrently watching those streams.
[326:21.03]And that's awesome.
[326:22.73]But I can't expect that's not going to happen every time.
[326:27.31]I also do, like somebody just said, that was my next point.
[326:29.59]I play and do so many different things on this stream every single time that there's no way it would be the same amount of people every time.
[326:46.93]Like today, right?
[326:48.01]I mean, there's still a lot of people here.
[326:51.50]But the people that don't want to watch me play a match for Bumbo game, they'll just kind of take off.
[326:57.88]Any genre, any game, I don't care about genres and what the exact game I'm playing is.
[327:06.22]I don't really have that anchor video game where it's like, hey guys, two or three times a week, I'm going to play Overwatch or Dota or something, right?
[327:17.03]There's not that anchor video game that I play every day or every week.
[327:24.37]So I can't let a view count get into my head for any reason, because there's no... It's... These streams are just kind of all over the place by design, so how could I expect people to be... The views are going to fluctuate all the time.
[327:40.70]So no, that does not bother me at all.
[327:44.82]That is... I mean, we make jokes sometimes.
[327:47.88]Like, oh, alright, how many people just left?
[327:49.42]500 people just left because I said that?
[327:52.24]But it's all just bullshit and I'm just fucking around.
[327:53.88]You guys know that.
[327:59.26]But no, I don't really think about it that much at all.
[328:06.07]We're begging you to show Otto.
[328:08.25]He's sleeping in the other room.
[328:14.19]I mean, if you think I care about view counts, do you really think I would be laughing as hard as I am sometimes about how Bugleberry dropped 2,000 to 3,000 concurrent viewers on the Halloween stream?
[328:29.10]That made me laugh.
[328:31.10]I wasn't like, oh, fuck.
[328:32.80]No, my views.
[328:37.96]It's alright.
[328:38.61]I get it.
[328:39.15]I get it.
[328:44.97]But, hopefully that answers your question.
[328:46.57]Kind of long-winded, but... Hopefully it answers what you were asking.
[328:53.37]Hey, Bobboy, you get five gifted subs.
[328:55.03]I didn't even see it.
[328:55.71]Thanks, Bobboy.
[328:59.07]It was the echo in the sound, I know.
[329:02.69]That makes it so much worse, but funnier.
[329:04.75]It's like the sound was so un-fucking-bearable that people just... I can't listen to this.
[329:10.32]I'm fucking leaving.
[329:15.33]And I did the loudest noise I've ever done on a stream.
[329:18.99]It's just... There's so many reasons why people would leave.
[329:24.83]Whatever.
[329:25.57]It's all good.
[329:26.31]It just makes me laugh.
[329:31.22]But... Thank you.
[329:36.99]Thank you, Ballboy.
[329:38.01]Ballboy with the five subs and 1500 bits.
[329:40.20]Half-Life Alyx was just announced as the flagship VR title by Valve.
[329:44.54]I hope it's... Thank you for the 1500 bits, by the way.
[329:46.28]But I do hope it's actually a video game.
[329:48.98]I do... I really hope... Like I said earlier, I hope this is not a tech demo for a new peripheral.
[329:55.16]That's like an hour and ten minutes.
[329:56.54]I hope this is a real game, like a flagship, actual, full VR video game.
[330:04.22]It's supposed to be a full game.
[330:07.16]But is it a full VR game?
[330:09.06]Because most full VR games are like 2 to 3 hours.
[330:12.09]It's 12 to 16 hours?
[330:13.93]You gotta be kidding me.
[330:15.05]Okay, well then that's awesome.
[330:16.23]I'm glad that that's now an unknown thing.
[330:21.15]It's 12 to 15 hours.
[330:23.71]It's not a tech demo for new tech.
[330:25.25]It's a demo for old tech.
[330:28.31]They haven't confirmed anything yet.
[330:29.50]Alright.
[330:31.36]Well, I'm gonna... My hands... I'm just gonna pull my hands back and just not just be like, okay.
[330:36.22]Whatever it ends up being, I hope it's very good.
[330:38.40]Because it has been a very long damn time since Valve actually made a video game.
[330:46.41]Yes, Artifact came out.
[330:48.85]But did it, though?
[330:53.51]I... I... It came out, yes.
[330:59.60]It released.
[331:00.30]But...
[331:07.61]And then, I know, but, uh... They've made a couple of games, but... If you love Artifact and you like it, then I'm glad you do.
[331:20.08]But I would have much rather something else than card game number, like, 30.
[331:33.20]No one does.
[331:34.36]Any Artifact fans here?
[331:36.84]Click on the link
[331:41.08]Alright, yeah.
[331:42.44]Why am I naked?
[331:43.26]I'm not that hairy.
[331:45.16]What's with the hair all... Is Farquaad hairy?
[331:52.14]But I hope it's good.
[331:52.90]I really do.
[331:53.77]I will play it.
[331:54.67]Is it index only?
[331:56.63]If it is, then that sucks.
[332:03.37]No.
[332:03.97]Okay, good.
[332:06.89]Thank you, Squad Dala, for the 300 bits.
[332:10.47]Mr. Elbertson, Jim Houseman here from FGI Fake Gamers Investigations.
[332:17.42]We're here to inform you that by reaching boomer age and never playing Metal Gear Solid 3, we are here to revoke your gamer license.
[332:23.52]Please don't leave your town in the next couple of days.
[332:26.05]Our fake agent prosecutor will contact you shortly.
[332:28.83]Thank you for your patience.
[332:29.65]I've played Metal Gear Solid 3.
[332:31.01]It's like my favorite one.
[332:33.46]That's the best Metal Gear.
[332:35.04]That's my favorite one.
[332:37.12]This is wrong info.
[332:46.13]Camera license secured.
[332:47.37]Anyways, thank you.
[332:50.05]Thank you for the 300 bits.
[332:59.03]SirKanon, thanks for the 250.
[333:00.47]Hello, Mr. Harringson.
[333:01.79]Sad to report that my son, Kevin, the kid that you punched in the face and you beat up too many times in Kinect Sports Boxing,
[333:11.63]you as you you can't that is this is just a dog post like it's just this is like I wish why would I look hello I'm sad report that my son Kevin the kid you inflicted brain damage on and kingdom uh connect sports boxing he passed away doing his inability to stop dancing to Han Solo epson chat from my boy Kevin oh great that's a good message
[333:38.66]That was just, like... What am I... How do I respond to this?
[333:52.43]You don't.
[333:52.87]It's word puke.
[333:55.75]Thank you for the 250, though.
[333:56.83]I appreciate it.
[333:57.53]Sad Vega thanks for the 250.
[333:58.79]Very excited for the Jerma King RP event.
[334:01.79]What game do you think you'll be using?
[334:05.09]Also, you should let Kiwo know, as I'm sure that's something that's right up her alley.
[334:09.49]I was thinking about seeing if anyone wanted to do it.
[334:12.19]I kind of want to do... I don't want to invite a bunch of streamers to do this.
[334:18.14]I'll give you one reason why.
[334:19.72]I'd like to do it once or twice, because if it just is an absolute mess, then I just wasted a bunch of people's time.
[334:30.99]Okay, you, you, you want to do it?
[334:32.35]Yeah, that sounds fun.
[334:32.93]You ought to be here at seven o'clock.
[334:34.23]Okay, you, yeah, we're all doing it.
[334:36.76]And somebody enchanted bows me in the head and I turn my stream off after five minutes.
[334:40.00]It's just like, what the fuck do these people do now?
[334:42.96]Well, I want to get like one or two under the belt to make sure it's like even going to be something that's fun.
[334:47.94]It's an experiment that we're going to do.
[334:53.35]So we'll get one under the belt, maybe two, and then we'll start to potentially see if anybody else wants to do it.
[335:07.82]But, yes, that is a thought.
[335:10.36]Absolutely.
[335:12.74]Hey, DarkSoul, thanks for the $2.50.
[335:13.98]I said I wasn't going to donate bits for now, but your letter was very convincing.
[335:23.54]Anyways, please play Metroid Prime 1 through 3 on stream, and I won't have to eat my GameCube.
[335:28.25]Thank you.
[335:39.12]Imagine a streamer doesn't play Metroid Prime 1 in like a week, so you fucking eat your GameCube?
[335:51.20]Who's there?
[335:52.86]You're just doing it in your room?
[335:55.90]Ah, shit, he didn't play it.
[335:58.12]I gotta go eat the GameCube now.
[336:00.34]How do you eat a GameCube?
[336:03.64]Do you just melt it down, the plastic, and then just drink it?
[336:15.87]That's an interesting thought.
[336:17.55]Those games are supposed to be really good, by the way.
[336:18.97]I have never played any one of them.
[336:22.87]Yes, I know.
[336:23.83]It's like, whoa, how have you not played Metroid Prime?
[336:26.39]I've seen it played.
[336:27.81]I've seen it played for like 20 minutes.
[336:31.31]I have not played it myself.
[336:32.96]There's a lot of games that I have not played that I'd like to.
[336:36.72]I missed a huge bit donation from AB Joe.
[336:39.76]5,012 bits.
[336:40.12]Thank you, Joe.
[336:44.88]fifty dollars over fifty dollars hey Jermbo looking forward to watching you play the new Half-Life keep up the entertaining streams jermaHeart my man yeah I'll be playing that second it comes out along here's the thing though I was gonna say along with every single other person on Twitch I feel like VR and not very many people stream VR they do but I will there be that many people actually streaming that game when it comes out
[337:14.13]Probably, but... They'll have to.
[337:21.53]It's Half-Life.
[337:22.99]Well, watch my stream.
[337:25.55]I promise you, out of all the... Okay, let's say there's like 5,000 people streaming that on Twitch.
[337:31.36]I'm gonna bump into my wall.
[337:34.44]Oh, they probably will too.
[337:36.18]I'm gonna swing and miss and hit the post.
[337:38.88]They'll do that too.
[337:40.18]I'm gonna scream when I turn around and I see something that I didn't know was behind me.
[337:43.27]They'll do that too.
[337:47.75]Watch me, though.
[337:48.69]Come on.
[337:51.11]You gotta watch me.
[337:56.95]VR funny moment.
[338:00.45]Now, I hope it gets a lot of attention, so then I hope Valve decides, hey, wasn't it fun when we made video games that people liked?
[338:07.26]That was cool.
[338:07.82]Maybe we should do that again.
[338:11.60]But thank you, Joe.
[338:12.52]Yes, I'll be playing it within three days of it coming out, I would say.
[338:21.31]Thank you, I think I can, for the thousand bits.
[338:24.98]Appreciate it.
[338:25.48]Jerma, you know many other content creators have gotten... You know... You know many... Hold on.
[338:30.70]I'm speaking strangely.
[338:32.56]Jerma, you know many other content creators have gotten me to laugh.
[338:36.38]Some of you made me laugh crying.
[338:38.58]But no one has ever made me legitimately fear for my life from laughing so hard that it hurt throughout my whole body.
[338:45.78]You...
[338:50.98]You're the greatest person I've ever watched, and I want you to know that I absolutely adore your streams and you yourself.
[338:55.34]Please keep doing this for as long as physically possible.
[338:58.54]I'm looking forward to your retirement home streams.
[339:03.39]That's an incredibly nice thing to say.
[339:08.01]I hope you don't end up being killed from laughing at this stream, but I will tell you, there has actually been three or four times where I thought that I was actually in danger.
[339:23.08]The last time it happened was... Sims 4 is... I mean, I seriously thought that something bad was going to happen to me.
[339:35.08]And it was not what you think.
[339:36.04]It was the dog... The guy doing drugs and walking his dog in his house.
[339:40.90]It was... So... So fucking funny.
[339:46.81]It was unbearably funny.
[339:49.09]And then dogs were, like, rolling around in the pee...
[339:56.09]Like, why would you put a leash on a dog and then walk the dog in your house?
[340:02.09]Like, you're just so fucked up on drugs.
[340:04.13]Okay.
[340:05.75]But, actually, the last time, recently, was in Planet Zoo, when I was trying to get the monkey to climb out of the enclosure, and he kept taking that way the long way, and the alarms would sound.
[340:20.88]And you'd get... Ugh.
[340:27.15]I gotta be careful, though, because... If you laugh hard, you can, like... I don't know.
[340:35.34]I'm not even gonna get into it, but you can, like... I feel like I may have given myself a hernia.
[340:43.46]It's actually one of the things that I'm being checked for soon.
[340:48.18]So, I mean, full transparency here for the medical stuff.
[340:56.74]I'm being checked for a hernia.
[341:01.91]I don't know.
[341:03.37]That's what I was told.
[341:06.05]So, this is not what's happened.
[341:10.88]I'm just giving you a scenario that is so strange.
[341:15.53]I don't even know if this is possible, but can you imagine a scenario where I laughed so hard at The Sims 4 drug dog pee thing that I gave myself a hernia last year?
[341:27.80]Can you imagine how fucking ridiculous that is?
[341:32.64]I don't even know if that's medically possible.
[341:35.39]I am speaking totally out of my ass here.
[341:37.71]I'm just saying that's fucking so stupid.
[341:49.57]I'm not even sure that that's even how that works.
[341:52.32]But I am... Out of all the things I'm being checked for, I've had my liver checked, I'm having my throat down the tube into my stomach to check for a hernia.
[342:01.95]We're just trying to figure it out.
[342:03.31]Why I... I'm fine.
[342:06.87]You know, everything's gonna be fine.
[342:15.84]What a way to go.
[342:21.43]You're gonna go, no, but I know, but that's not even real.
[342:23.93]I'm just saying.
[342:24.67]How fucked up would that be?
[342:28.95]I want to make sure that's very clear on the record that I have, that's a total bullshit thing that I'm just saying.
[342:38.64]So, no, that's definitely not what happened.
[342:43.74]But, it'd be wild.
[342:47.17]But, anyways, uh, thank you, I think I can, for your 2400 bits.
[342:56.66]I really appreciate it.
[342:58.32]The second part of your message here is, I have an odd number of bits, so this is a separate message.
[343:05.53]Uh, still appreciate you, though my thoughts and opinions have not changed even in the last 20 minutes.
[343:11.46]Good thing I didn't say anything in 20 minutes that you started to hate me for.
[343:14.30]Hope you didn't watch last night's stream where I talked about mayonnaise and fries.
[343:20.15]Looking forward to the coming of the king.
[343:24.69]If life ever becomes too much, I'll just lock myself in a room and blast every Jerma video through full volume speakers right next to my ears.
[343:41.42]I would advise not doing that, because you're gonna cause hearing damage.
[343:46.08]But, I really appreciate it.
[343:48.98]Thanks for the 2400 fucking bits.
[343:50.92]Seriously.
[343:53.45]You're gonna give yourself an ear hernia.
[343:57.85]Thanks a lot.
[343:59.63]Thank you Silent Serenity for the 250.
[344:01.21]Hey Jerma, if you could put your brain in a jar and stream for the rest of eternity, would you do it?
[344:04.83]No.
[344:06.67]No, I don't wanna fucking be around forever.
[344:14.33]I would rather you put my brain in a jar and, like, have me generate electricity.
[344:22.50]But, hold on.
[344:23.16]Do we know if, like, I'm, like, in a nightmare during that scenario?
[344:29.97]Maybe.
[344:30.17]We'll look into that.
[344:33.31]He already is a brain in a jar.
[344:34.61]Don't say that.
[344:35.15]That's scary.
[344:39.29]It would be a low wattage.
[344:43.74]Now that is a factual statement, but I know you're saying that because you're saying I'm like stupid.
[344:48.44]So it works both ways, but it's not even real.
[344:52.84]Because your brain, guess what, would have really low wattage too.
[344:56.62]It wouldn't just be my brain, it would be yours too.
[344:58.65]You got a low wattage brain too.
[345:11.43]But thank you.
[345:11.89]Thank you Elizabeth for the 250.
[345:13.07]You should hit up Kryken with those.
[345:14.93]Fuck the king stream.
[345:15.89]Sounds like they're jammed.
[345:18.09]Yeah, there's... Like I said, I want to get like one or two down.
[345:21.90]The lazy king that doesn't do anything stream.
[345:26.84]With a thousand people that's trying to kill you.
[345:29.56]Is fun on paper.
[345:31.33]I just want to make sure it works in practice before I ask it if anybody else is interested to come like have fun and roleplay on the servers.
[345:45.92]Just make your character invisible.
[345:52.61]Hey, Vanilla Grime, thanks for the 500 bits.
[345:54.29]Please help, I can't stop you going to the bathroom.
[345:57.51]Well, I would probably go to the doctor.
[345:59.99]Now here's the fun game we like to play called Does My Webcam... Is My Webcam Turned On When I Change Scenes?
[346:08.28]Because I don't have any clothes on.
[346:09.34]So I'm going to cover it.
[346:16.77]not turned on okay good let's roll the credits silent serenity thanks the 250 Jerma have you ever tried saying I know I'm in a simulation out loud where you alone you know just to see if they let you out
[346:52.40]Uh, no, I've never tried it.
[346:54.26]But, and phylactery, again, phylactery, it takes for the 5,000 bits phylactery.
[346:59.99]Here come the subs!
[347:04.35]It says it's beautiful and I got hacked?
[347:07.35]What does this say?
[347:14.86]Oh.
[347:18.04]No, it says it's beautiful and feature-packed.
[347:20.28]Thank you for the subs, everybody.
[347:27.26]Appreciate it.
[347:28.90]All of you.
[347:30.94]The lot of you.
[347:36.67]Thank you.
[347:39.19]But... Let's talk about what Phylactery did say.
[347:43.99]They said you will go down in medical books as the guy who laughed at a dog rolling around and pissed so hard that he caused himself permanent damage.
[347:50.20]That was 5,000 bits.
[347:51.48]Phylactery, a fucking huge amount of money.
[347:54.24]Today and always...
[348:01.94]But like I said, I don't even think that's physically possible.
[348:06.69]I'm just making up a scenario.
[348:13.97]Watch the clip.
[348:16.18]No, I can't.
[348:17.66]I can't ever watch this clip ever again.
[348:42.03]Dude, the dog is doing it so much.
[348:46.58]But the context, you have the dog, you have the piss.
[348:53.46]And the stars around the guy's head.
[348:58.28]This is the moment that gave him a hernia.
[349:02.32]No, I don't even want that to be like jokingly a thing people say because it's definitely not true.
[349:15.49]Alright, I can't.
[349:18.19]I'll see you guys in a few days.
[349:19.19]See you on Thursday, 1 to 2 p.m.
[349:22.05]Pacific.
[349:24.95]Take care, guys.
[349:26.32]Have a great one.
[349:28.64]Good night.
[349:41.95]Good night, guys.
[349:45.15]Good night.
[349:45.55]Goodbye.
