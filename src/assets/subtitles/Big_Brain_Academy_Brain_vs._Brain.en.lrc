[00:06.63]Big Brain Academy is installed.
[00:14.28]We're not going to play it yet.
[00:18.26]Not yet.
[00:18.86]That was fast.
[00:25.99]It was.
[00:26.91]Did I jump scare you?
[00:30.95]I'm sorry.
[00:31.41]I'm just ready to get back into... I'm going to play one more Picross level, and then we're going to open Big Brain Academy, okay?
[00:36.17]Okay.
[00:40.29]One final Picross level.
[00:44.33]Agravas.
[00:47.19]Oh, shit.
[00:49.17]I clicked.
[00:49.55]All right, never mind.
[00:50.21]I'm playing Big Brain Academy now, apparently.
[00:53.19]I clicked that button.
[00:54.33]I did the... I closed it.
[00:56.39]All right.
[00:58.63]Big Brain Academy.
[01:00.07]Brain versus brain.
[01:04.22]Here we go.
[01:15.52]Big Brain Academy is not Brain Age.
[01:18.40]What?
[01:21.14]What are you talking about?
[01:21.90]This is not Brain Age?
[01:23.09]Wait, how many brain games are there?
[01:26.75]What do you mean wrong game?
[01:27.91]I bought the wrong game.
[01:29.41]Big Brain?
[01:30.29]Big Brain!
[01:31.23]What?
[01:34.43]What are you talking about?
[01:35.40]There's another one?
[01:37.06]Uh...
[01:43.70]Brain age is not available on the Switch in North America.
[01:47.62]This is the one we're playing.
[01:50.92]Yeah, me, me, Johnny500.
[01:57.95]Okay.
[01:59.05]Do you feel as if your brain has been a bit more stiff than usual?
[02:04.24]Well, here at the Academy, we offer a variety of activities to help you stretch and flex that brain of yours.
[02:08.86]This game is good, don't worry.
[02:09.88]Okay.
[02:10.02]Okay.
[02:12.13]So without further ado, let's get started stretching your brain.
[02:15.91]To begin, we'll enroll you in the academy.
[02:17.64]So if you would, tell us about yourself.
[02:19.62]How old are you?
[02:20.22]I've never fucking asked that question.
[02:25.80]Fuck.
[02:31.77]No, I'm not that old.
[02:33.09]I'm like fucking 32, man.
[02:35.55]I'm like 34.
[02:35.85]I'm too old.
[02:41.54]Yeah, I was born on January 1st, 1988.
[02:43.50]1987.
[02:44.18]1986.
[02:44.20]1985.
[02:44.34]Okay.
[02:44.64]Who cares?
[02:45.48]Tell us your style.
[02:49.44]Oh.
[02:55.18]Okay.
[03:02.59]Your occupation.
[03:03.37]Choose something close to your real occupation.
[03:08.85]Um...
[03:11.49]Okay, preschooler, grade schooler, middle schooler, high schooler, college student, student of life.
[03:18.59]I'm a business owner.
[03:21.47]Self-employed.
[03:22.09]Free agent.
[03:26.25]I'm a business owner.
[03:29.21]I'm a business owner, free agent, self-employed office worker.
[03:32.09]Just combine them.
[03:34.93]Self-employed.
[03:38.47]Next up, your catchphrase.
[03:39.77]You can change this later, so just pick anything that strikes you.
[03:44.43]Uh... Buried in homework.
[03:47.29]Send help.
[03:49.73]But you forgot, like, the crying emoji.
[03:51.33]Can't say no to candy.
[03:56.79]I have only one speed, and it's easy, does it?
[03:59.59]That's kind of accurate.
[04:04.09]Gotta finish strong.
[04:05.19]I'll do it to- Or that.
[04:09.57]I only have one speed and it's easy, does it?
[04:11.50]I'll do it tomorrow.
[04:15.40]How do grown-ups get to have all the fun?
[04:17.06]It's funny how the ages, the different age groups.
[04:22.16]This is like for a kid to say this.
[04:24.22]Is it a launch day?
[04:25.06]Why do grown-ups get all the fun?
[04:28.39]Like a grown-up's not supposed to pick that.
[04:29.77]Comfort is key.
[04:33.45]Can't be too careful.
[04:35.62]It's simple.
[04:36.14]Be sincere.
[04:36.84]I like to be liked.
[04:38.46]Why make only one mistake?
[04:43.34]I'm a fan of being a fan.
[04:45.13]My grandkids are the cutest.
[04:46.55]Horses are better than people.
[04:53.95]Check the appearance you prefer while attending our academy.
[04:56.27]You can change this later as well, so don't fret.
[04:57.90]Okay.
[04:59.58]Okay.
[05:12.97]Hold on.
[05:15.25]That's pretty close.
[05:18.67]Close.
[05:33.10]That's not bad either.
[05:38.12]Which one?
[05:40.22]It's this one.
[05:40.90]It has to be.
[05:44.15]Okay, facial hair.
[05:48.47]No, I don't have facial hair.
[05:52.41]Uh, German 985 green.
[05:53.27]Sure.
[05:53.49]Sure.
[06:02.26]Alright, I'm done.
[06:08.99]Also, allow me to introduce our online features.
[06:11.49]You can compete with others in Ghost Clash.
[06:13.12]I don't want to do that.
[06:13.74]Fuck off.
[06:14.88]Are you comfortable with photographs of bugs?
[06:21.02]What?
[06:24.28]This often prevents photographs of some creepy critters from appearing.
[06:27.32]What do you mean, bugs?
[06:36.23]Okay, practice.
[06:36.89]Let's go.
[06:39.05]Let's begin by stretching and flexing your brain in practice.
[06:44.73]Tada, welcome to practice.
[06:45.55]It's our specialty here at the Academy.
[06:47.57]If I may, I suggest you start by trying an activity in the identify category.
[06:51.45]Sure.
[06:54.32]Why not give whack match a try?
[06:58.28]You can play with either button or touch.
[07:00.44]I'm gonna play with buttons.
[07:02.36]Whack the mole with the matching picture.
[07:07.86]That's like kind of depressing.
[07:08.98]Okay.
[07:10.16]Just click the things.
[07:10.88]All right.
[07:12.16]It's easy.
[07:14.00]All right.
[07:42.38]I need a face cam for this, don't I?
[07:44.52]Yeah, no, no, no, I got it, I got it.
[07:47.43]I got, I need, I distracted myself.
[08:11.53]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[08:12.98]I need a face cam.
[08:13.74]I gotta put clothes on.
[08:14.56]Hold on.
[08:15.24]You guys need to be able to see my face for this.
[08:17.28]One sec.
[08:17.54]I just need a shirt.
[09:55.07]Okay, I'm back.
[09:56.23]Let me just make sure this looks alright.
[09:57.71]Which it should.
[10:00.11]How's it look?
[10:06.34]Does it look alright?
[10:09.60]Too dark.
[10:11.52]Why is it so dark?
[10:26.34]Oh shit.
[10:26.92]Hold on, I gotta change the setting here.
[10:28.34]Hold on.
[10:33.73]Wasn't planning on this.
[10:36.33]Put the light on?
[10:36.99]I do have a light on.
[10:37.77]Every webcam that's been created has got some of the worst light controls ever.
[10:49.45]That's better.
[10:50.86]Bye.
[10:54.70]Alright.
[11:03.21]Let's go!
[11:03.47]You ready?
[11:06.23]This is gonna stay on for Elden Ring anyways.
[11:12.47]It's a delay.
[11:13.11]Oh shit, that's right.
[11:13.91]Hold on, I gotta fix that.
[11:20.98]I didn't even check to make sure that that was actually working, by the way.
[11:34.07]There we go.
[11:35.01]Alright, we actually have to test this to make sure that everything's synced up correctly.
[11:37.91]Because when you pull a console through a capture card, it just delays it.
[11:45.45]That's good, right?
[11:47.06]One!
[11:47.84]Two!
[11:48.68]Three!
[11:51.34]I did pretty good.
[11:53.24]Alright, one gold lobe metal.
[11:57.98]Alright.
[12:03.56]this is actually kind of this is gonna be fun uh no try to collect all the gold lobe metals all right so that was just one all right that was a cool thing your journey towards impressive big brain bronze scores just began
[12:29.70]Alright.
[12:29.94]I'll just keep doing it.
[12:32.66]What about memorize, analyze, compute?
[12:35.15]Oh wait, we need to test this.
[12:36.01]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[12:37.05]Is it in sync?
[12:38.93]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[12:39.23]No?
[12:39.63]Your video's later?
[12:40.87]Is it close enough?
[13:01.72]game is late I'm going all right let me try this one two one two three one two one two three better
[13:34.24]Alright, flash memory.
[13:35.24]Let's try this one.
[13:38.74]Use the buttons.
[13:41.12]What were the numbers and symbols?
[13:46.92]What?
[13:47.26]5, 6, 6.
[13:48.95]It's just showing it to me.
[13:53.19]6.
[13:53.83]Oh, okay.
[13:54.33]I get it.
[14:36.62]What the fuck?
[14:37.18]I didn't- What?
[14:39.27]What?
[14:40.81]I didn't want to go forward that other way.
[14:42.29]Dude, I didn't want to go- I pressed the button accidentally one more time.
[14:57.14]Alright, that was fun.
[15:03.41]Focus up.
[15:04.09]I'm focusing.
[15:05.11]I just pressed the... I... By the way... Would you like to see the perfect controller?
[15:14.48]This is perfect.
[15:15.70]In every way.
[15:18.16]Hand placement.
[15:20.44]Analog placement.
[15:23.89]The face buttons.
[15:27.87]I thought you just got mad at it.
[15:29.27]Yeah, but I got mad at me because I pressed the button accidentally.
[15:32.27]One more time.
[15:36.68]I actually think this is... The one thing I would change on this is the triggers, I think, should have a little bit more give.
[15:42.06]But placement-wise and hand placement, I like it the most.
[15:44.52]The pro controller.
[15:49.69]The PS5 controller is the best one, right?
[15:51.35]I mean, that's simple.
[15:52.71]Alright, which one is heavier?
[15:59.72]Oh.
[16:49.33]I don't know.
[16:50.25]There's too many things, too many colors.
[16:51.49]That's too many colors.
[16:59.49]Literally, I can't do this.
[17:02.61]Too many different things are on the screen.
[17:07.82]Nice Omega March shirt.
[17:13.94]Oh, you noticed!
[17:14.52]There it is.
[17:18.19]That was really cool.
[17:21.38]I got three medals.
[17:23.58]Wow.
[17:29.70]There's more?
[17:32.02]Choose two cards that add up to the numbers shown at the top.
[17:36.09]So it's just addition.
[17:36.99]It doesn't matter what animal it is?
[18:26.68]What, that wasn't nine?
[18:27.38]Oh, um... Ah!
[18:41.89]I can't!
[18:42.33]So many colors!
[18:51.54]Oh my god, he's stupid.
[18:53.20]No, I'm a visual learner.
[18:56.67]Okay?
[18:57.41]You- I'm gonna destroy- Here's the thing.
[18:59.44]People are gonna talk all this shit.
[19:01.28]I am going to destroy one of these.
[19:05.62]And you people are gonna think there's something wrong with me.
[19:07.24]You're gonna think I'm cheating.
[19:09.28]There's like one learning category that I'm gonna do really good in and I'm gonna get like ultra advanced.
[19:14.17]Ultra advanced.
[19:15.47]The rest of these are gonna be like at a fourth grade level.
[19:21.35]This is not one of them.
[19:22.81]This is not one of them.
[19:23.60]I know this.
[19:24.32]I've had- I've taken this test before.
[19:31.37]What?
[20:07.67]a little one but that was every single piece
[20:39.86]Being a visual learner was proven to be bullshit.
[20:41.98]Only people made it up.
[20:54.75]Only intermediate.
[20:56.13]I'm not good at this kind of stuff.
[20:58.41]Just wait till I get to the fucking numbers and I'm gonna destroy it and I'm gonna make you all look foolish.
[21:04.13]How would it look if you looked at it from the direction of the arrow?
[22:21.53]That one hurts my head.
[22:27.62]Slow down.
[22:28.14]Isn't there a timer?
[22:33.60]There's a timer.
[22:34.36]Isn't it like tick, tick, tick?
[22:37.96]I hear like a clock ticking.
[22:40.59]There is a timer.
[22:41.23]Yeah, there is.
[22:45.33]Add the missing tracks.
[22:46.35]All right, let's fucking look.
[22:47.55]Let's look at an idiot.
[22:51.46]What do you mean, add the track?
[22:53.31]Oh.
[22:54.95]Why would they...
[23:51.04]No!
[23:51.32]I didn't want to press that one!
[23:54.22]Seriously, it's really sensitive.
[23:57.18]Sometimes it goes like double, or it doesn't go at all.
[24:02.60]I was trying to move, but sometimes it would go like and tick twice.
[24:06.44]This D-pad sucks.
[24:07.50]This controller sucks.
[24:08.70]It's got good placement, that's all.
[24:22.73]Oh my god, it's perfect.
[24:25.85]Uh, yeah, I'll put on sunglasses, cool.
[24:30.41]Alright, nice.
[24:33.77]So that was memorize, this is analyze.
[24:35.57]I'm gonna look really bad to a lot of people.
[24:46.42]People are gonna think like I'm on drugs or something.
[24:54.77]Speed sorting.
[24:58.59]Which picture fits the description?
[25:00.71]Plant.
[25:03.49]Living.
[25:04.27]Plant.
[25:05.35]Fish.
[25:06.73]Doesn't swim with fins?
[25:11.05]Wait, what does that mean?
[25:11.81]I don't get it.
[25:12.45]I don't, what does it mean?
[25:14.91]Doesn't swim with fins.
[25:15.69]What does that mean?
[25:23.55]No, I want to do the car.
[25:24.75]What the fuck?
[25:26.17]A fucking ladybug is not... I gotta start using the analog.
[25:36.61]That's worse somehow.
[26:00.96]What was that?
[26:01.38]Was it a mole?
[26:02.22]It was an eggplant!
[26:11.65]I thought it was a muscle!
[26:19.67]I wanna do that one again.
[26:20.31]I wanna do this one again.
[26:33.32]Okay, I thought that was like a celestial body.
[26:38.80]Those are fins.
[26:42.03]No!
[26:43.33]I didn't want to press that.
[27:05.38]For some reason, I didn't think pig was a mammal.
[27:07.02]I thought it was a trick question for some reason.
[27:08.33]I was like, what is it then?
[27:13.47]Um, I don't know.
[27:14.19]What else is cold-blooded?
[27:15.11]A bug's cold-blooded?
[27:25.98]I can't hit it to relax.
[27:37.14]Are bugs cold-blooded?
[27:38.86]I'm serious.
[27:40.66]I don't know.
[27:41.98]You only hear that for like lizards and shit.
[27:44.98]I don't fucking know.
[27:46.61]The bugs don't even have blood.
[27:48.03]They have like fucking... They have like cerebral fluid and that's it.
[27:51.31]Bugs don't have blood?
[27:52.17]They have like a little bit of like juice in their head.
[28:16.66]Shark is not a fish, I thought.
[28:18.26]I thought that was a big debate.
[28:27.73]These eat things?
[28:33.79]No!
[28:35.65]I thought it said move with legs.
[28:44.83]A tricycle is, what do you mean, slower than a bug?
[28:47.35]Fourth slowest?
[29:08.28]No!
[29:08.98]The fucking D-pad sucks!
[29:16.73]I wanna go like this way, and I go like up left, up left, up left, up left.
[29:20.31]It's like up left, up left, up left.
[29:21.71]I'm just trying to go right, man!
[29:22.83]One more try, that's it.
[29:54.55]Okay, I didn't know the octopus laid eggs.
[30:29.34]Oh, I got it.
[30:29.88]Alright, that was super elite.
[30:44.47]Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[30:48.93]Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[30:50.37]Alright, Match Blast.
[30:59.12]This is fun, damn.
[31:00.90]Break blocks to copy the top shape.
[31:05.33]I get it.
[32:08.99]That was too hard.
[32:13.92]That was too hard.
[32:14.64]That was way too much.
[32:19.34]I fucking guarantee if you try to hit me with a sword, I could dodge it.
[32:23.02]I fucking guarantee it.
[32:24.24]If you had a fucking battle axe and you were going to try to get me with it, you're not going to get me with it.
[32:28.69]I'm too fast for you.
[32:29.83]Way too fast.
[32:30.35]No way.
[32:34.67]I am fast as fuck and I have lightning-like reflexes in real life.
[32:39.01]I don't care what some little fucking grasshopper says about how stupid I am.
[32:44.93]You got a swing of the axe?
[32:47.57]I'm fucking gone.
[32:49.58]Not happening.
[33:03.88]I've been playing too many video games.
[33:10.77]Why is that the first thing I go to?
[33:12.34]I've been playing too much Elden Ring.
[33:13.48]I really have.
[33:14.12]I've been playing too many video games.
[33:18.34]Alright, how many cubes are there?
[33:22.45]Three.
[33:54.68]What the 16 of them?
[34:15.64]I can't concentrate!
[34:18.70]18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
[34:22.12]I can't concentrate.
[34:23.00]I can't concentrate.
[34:24.36]I don't like this one.
[34:27.41]I actually can't concentrate.
[34:28.63]I'm fine.
[34:32.29]I'm okay.
[34:32.81]I just can't concentrate.
[34:34.79]I have huge concentration problems ever since I was a little child.
[34:39.96]You got me with an axe!
[34:41.90]And I'm fucking gonna dodge it!
[34:55.57]Alright, how about compute?
[34:57.71]There's more under memorize.
[34:59.09]Memo random.
[35:01.73]Memorize the picture on the car before it flips.
[35:03.41]Which one was it?
[35:04.11]I should be- I'm gonna do- We're gonna get super late on this one.
[35:07.84]What?
[35:14.48]Wait!
[35:14.86]Oh, it's the one that flips over.
[35:15.96]Okay, I didn't understand the rules.
[35:31.95]Oh, fucking come on!
[35:33.14]I went to no-
[36:00.27]I didn't even fucking look at what it was.
[36:01.93]Slow down.
[36:02.95]I didn't understand the rules at the first few rounds of this.
[36:15.34]Where's my...
[36:28.70]All right, reverse retention.
[36:30.95]Remember the order and answer in reverse.
[37:49.82]You should see the face you're making.
[37:51.02]I don't care.
[37:54.28]This game is fun and everything, but what would happen if somebody came into the sky with an axe?
[37:58.56]I'll tell you what would happen.
[38:00.11]They wouldn't hit me.
[38:02.79]I would be on the other side of the room.
[38:05.37]It would be like Dark Souls 3 in real life.
[38:07.55]It would be like, oh, I'm coming this way!
[38:09.11]And I'd fucking, yoink!
[38:10.87]I would dodge it with perfect frame rate.
[38:12.95]Perfect frame invulnerability.
[38:17.93]Covered cages.
[38:20.65]Where are the birds?
[38:21.35]Make the cages go faster if you're up for it.
[38:23.13]I get it, okay.
[38:27.66]Already gone.
[39:33.17]I didn't get to super elite?
[39:42.53]Ooh, he was happy about that one.
[39:47.45]Legit based elite brain.
[39:50.59]Thank you.
[39:50.93]All right, okay, all right.
[39:54.54]So what do I do now?
[39:56.58]Oh, okay.
[39:57.96]Practice, test.
[40:00.58]Wait, I haven't seen all these.
[40:04.53]Alright, here we go.
[40:05.01]Species... Which animal is there more of?
[40:08.75]Look around with the spotlight.
[40:09.83]I just... I don't need them.
[40:30.73]They're the same!
[41:23.85]Not even super elite.
[41:29.99]I wonder if this guy could definitely dodge Battle Axe.
[41:32.57]I could.
[41:43.56]Which piece belongs in the box?
[41:45.28]Pay attention.
[41:55.78]Get it.
[42:07.43]Oh, I didn't want to pick that one.
[42:08.91]I'm getting frustrated.
[42:38.96]It gives me a fucking headache.
[42:45.64]I like know it too.
[42:46.74]I can see it, but my brain just can't do it.
[42:50.74]I can see it.
[42:51.48]It's just like mushing it all over together.
[42:55.61]I can't.
[42:58.87]I just can't do it, man.
[43:00.15]It's just like it just mushes in my brain.
[43:04.24]It's like I start looking at all of them at the same time.
[43:06.48]My brain sees all of them.
[43:08.45]And yo, I'm dodging that.
[43:10.39]He's peeking.
[43:13.01]I'm fine.
[43:13.63]Okay, fast focus.
[43:20.98]What is the picture of?
[43:21.80]How fast can you figure it out?
[43:39.81]It's a rabbit.
[43:40.51]It's a hippo.
[43:47.64]Owl.
[43:48.28]Snail!
[43:56.99]What?!
[44:00.59]Eggaroo.
[44:11.27]Is it a dog?
[44:11.91]It's a dog.
[44:16.52]Mouse.
[44:24.16]I don't know.
[44:24.58]A butterfly?
[44:25.38]What the fuck is that?
[44:26.84]What is that?
[44:27.60]Snake.
[44:30.48]I'll try it again.
[44:38.17]I like that one.
[44:38.75]That one's fun.
[44:49.93]Again, I like that one.
[44:56.82]It was the concrete that fucked me up.
[45:17.13]No, I didn't want to press it.
[45:18.63]I wanted to press Panda.
[45:19.63]I guess it's a cat?
[45:40.50]It could have been a snail.
[45:58.01]How the fuck are you supposed to do that?
[46:03.53]One more.
[46:06.16]This whole game could be contained in a 10 megabyte Flash website from 2008.
[46:10.26]I mean, that's kind of funny what you just said, but...
[46:28.73]Goat.
[46:30.11]Owl.
[46:30.57]It's probably seal or fish.
[46:35.29]Probably seal.
[46:36.71]Seal.
[46:43.72]Owl.
[46:43.90]Giraffe.
[46:45.02]Ostrich?
[46:45.48]I don't know what this is.
[47:01.09]I don't think you can blur it any harder.
[47:02.82]What is that?
[47:03.42]Fucking panda.
[47:26.48]I wasn't pretending.
[47:27.10]I was looking at the middle because the panda was facing the other way.
[47:30.10]It was like the back.
[47:30.90]It was like the back of a panda.
[47:41.05]I haven't seen a panda very much in my life either.
[47:42.73]No.
[47:42.81]All right.
[47:44.61]That was cool.
[47:46.05]So now we do.
[47:46.81]There's a couple we didn't do and visualize.
[47:48.49]We're going to do this one.
[47:50.55]Shadow shift.
[47:51.55]Find the pictures that match the shadows.
[47:53.25]Okay.
[48:13.66]No, I didn't want to click it.
[48:16.15]The round head.
[48:51.49]Who else is in there?
[49:04.32]You got something on the top of your screen?
[49:06.76]What is it?
[49:08.52]Tell me what it is so I can be aware of what it is.
[49:09.96]Okay, I have to read it in a log clock.
[49:20.04]Mullet Math.
[49:21.27]What is that?
[49:21.69]Oh, Mallet Math.
[49:22.99]Whack the blocks you don't need to leave behind the correct total.
[49:25.51]I need four.
[49:49.61]three, six, nine, 12, five, 10, 14, 21, seven, 14, 21, six, six, seven, eight, five, six, seven, five, eight, nine, 10, nine, 10.
[50:18.83]No!
[50:19.35]I didn't want to do that.
[50:20.41]Why did it fucking move?
[50:22.37]I wanted to get rid of the other one.
[50:30.00]21.
[50:30.02]21, 21.
[50:30.20]No, I didn't.
[50:34.50]Seriously, sometimes it just goes.
[50:36.22]I'm not trying to press the button.
[50:41.05]You dodged into it.
[50:41.75]Okay.
[50:48.17]Rotate the clock hands to match the time.
[50:49.73]Spring forward an hour.
[51:01.78]Fall back 15 minutes.
[51:05.22]Uh oh.
[51:12.28]Fall back 30 minutes.
[51:13.18]Fall back 240 minutes.
[51:29.95]Go forward 120 minutes.
[51:33.35]Where did I start?
[51:38.92]Bring forward 245 minutes.
[51:40.06]5, 10, 15, 20.
[51:40.26]It's weird on the controller.
[51:57.48]Look.
[51:58.38]Let me show you what happens.
[51:59.32]Let me show you what happens when I use the... It's weird on the controller.
[52:02.11]You're supposed to fucking touch that.
[52:05.05]Like, it's weird.
[52:06.55]Like, I can't... It's really weird on the controller.
[52:12.24]I swear to God.
[52:14.24]Up from lowest to highest.
[52:28.26]Thank you.
[53:00.48]negative 80 what dude I hate this controls I'm trying to I get start over start over start over start over start over
[53:26.89]This D-pad sucks, asshole.
[53:28.45]It's fucking the worst D-pad of any controller.
[53:41.14]Use the analog stick.
[53:42.18]Analog stick is awful here.
[54:09.06]Oh!
[54:38.43]That was negative 71!
[54:50.04]Fuck you!
[54:54.60]I give up.
[54:54.92]I don't care.
[54:55.76]Who gives a shit?
[54:56.30]Who fucking- What does this even matter?
[54:57.94]Brain- Oh, brain training.
[55:00.34]Who gives a shit?
[55:01.44]What does this matter?
[55:02.56]Why does this even matter?
[55:03.54]Like, this whole thing doesn't make any- Who cares?
[55:06.94]What specific case does it matter if I can pop balloons in a certain order if they like are tricked to make you look bigger and smaller?
[55:13.95]You know what is practical?
[55:15.17]I'll tell you what's practical.
[55:17.24]A guy running at you with an axe and you got nowhere to go.
[55:20.82]That's what I call practical fucking things to know.
[55:24.65]I'm telling you, dodging, dashing, and shit, like that- Oh no!
[55:28.81]Here comes the fucking battle axe!
[55:30.95]Open up!
[55:31.53]One, two, three, four- No, you're gone.
[55:34.36]Sorry, buddy.
[55:35.80]I know practical shit.
[55:37.06]I don't care about impractical shit, like counting balloons in a room of various shapes and colors.
[55:41.88]Let's take the test.
[55:50.51]Let's measure your big brain brawn by having you compete activities in five categories.
[55:58.35]I'm going double headphones.
[56:03.08]Memorize the numbers and symbols, repeat them before you forget.
[57:16.83]Alright, identify.
[57:18.57]No!
[57:19.08]Which piece belongs in the box?
[57:20.42]Pay attention to the movement.
[57:21.52]I'm gonna- Shut up!
[58:27.52]I'M LOSING POINTS!!
[58:28.56]Uh-oh.
[58:43.02]Number of cubes.
[58:43.75]The number of cubes.
[59:27.18]I think I did pretty good.
[59:54.75]All right, let's go with the train one.
[59:55.90]I was good at this one too.
[60:37.80]Oops.
[60:38.14]Oops, I'm fucking- I'm flopping here.
[60:54.72]I had it.
[61:06.82]I gotta move with it.
[61:07.78]That's how I do everything.
[61:08.59]Alright, computing time.
[61:11.61]Alright.
[61:12.27]This is gonna be bad, but it's alright.
[61:38.93]No!
[61:39.39]I didn't want to go up again!
[61:41.09]Fucking controller!
[61:51.82]What are you doing?
[62:24.77]Well done.
[62:26.27]How'd I do?
[62:27.05]How was your first test?
[62:28.41]Your test results are reflected in your big brain score.
[62:30.53]Alright.
[62:34.51]My big brain score is 3300.
[62:36.21]An average person who hasn't spent time in practice will score about 1500.
[62:43.33]So, I practiced, so I should be somewhere around two or three thousand.
[62:59.29]2886!
[62:59.31]This is a very good score.
[63:02.53]Time to give your brain a grade.
[63:09.90]A++ dude.
[63:10.86]You're getting started.
[63:14.06]Let's aim for even higher.
[63:15.26]You can't get higher than A++.
[63:17.96]I told you I was a visual learner.
[63:30.67]I'm very, my analytics are terrible.
[63:36.93]But I can visualize, compute, and identify an attack.
[63:42.93]I'm gonna lay into this.
[63:43.69]I don't need to memorize anything, I don't need to analyze anything.
[63:53.37]Visualize, it is important to accurately perceive that which you see with your eyes.
[63:58.68]Furthermore, there's room for improvement in Analyze.
[64:01.26]I recommend flexing and stretching there.
[64:05.52]What is Analyze?
[64:06.88]If you can answer a little faster, you'll be better.
[64:10.79]Tell me, have you been collecting gold, low metals?
[64:13.13]I have no doubt you're capable of acquiring more.
[64:14.71]Well then, it's time to announce your big brain type.
[64:20.19]This is your brain type.
[64:22.52]Visualizing and computing.
[64:27.11]see it, and I can compute it, and I can attack it.
[64:32.40]Visualization and computation.
[64:34.68]Battleaxe brain Andy.
[64:41.08]That was fun.
[64:55.25]So I can do more?
[64:56.49]What is this?
[64:56.89]I wonder what that button does.
[64:59.05]Try to earn gold medals in every practice activity.
[65:06.11]Do a ghost clash.
[65:08.93]I don't think I pay for the Switch Online.
[65:11.40]I don't think I have it.
[65:14.68]I'm pretty sure I don't have, like... I think I stopped it.
[65:24.20]So wait, this is apparently what I'm bad at.
[65:27.18]That makes sense.
[65:29.80]Is it though?
[65:30.34]I crushed this.
[65:33.98]You had it from Mario Tennis.
[65:38.25]Didn't I crush this in the actual exam?
[65:42.09]This was bad.
[65:43.15]So was this.
[65:43.59]I nailed it.
[65:47.49]I got to look super elite.
[65:50.28]When are you gonna play Elden Ring?
[65:51.87]Well, I'll tell you.
[65:53.65]In... Literally like 5 minutes, 10 minutes.
[65:57.63]I'm gonna take a break, and it's gonna be a long break.
[65:59.91]It's gonna be somewhere over 15 to 20 minutes.
[66:02.62]I'm gonna eat.
[66:05.36]I'm gonna chill.
[66:05.88]And come back in about 15 plus 20, just probably about 20 minutes.
[66:11.36]And we're gonna come back and play Elden Ring for the rest of the night.
[66:14.34]So there's gonna be an intermission for food.
[66:15.62]Because I started at like 1.
[66:17.44]And I want to be able to go till like, you know, 11, 12, 1 a.m.
[66:22.26]I have like a 10 to 12 hour stream, but I want to eat in the middle and go, you know, if I need to do things I can.
[66:28.90]So I'll be playing it in like 25 minutes, 30 minutes.
[66:33.30]It's gonna be a long one?
[66:34.16]Well, the reason why I did a long stream today, specifically, specifically, so, is because I'm not gonna be around for the next, like, week.
[66:49.05]And I really want to play Elden Ring.
[66:51.13]So the idea was to break it up a little bit and play something else that's not Elden Ring, but I still wanted to play Elden Ring because I'm obsessed with it.
[66:58.34]And I don't want to not play Elden Ring for, like, the next five straight days.
[67:02.78]You know what I mean?
[67:04.10]Like, I could have just played this and then, like, done the Streamer Awards stuff because that's this weekend.
[67:09.38]So that's why I'm not going to be around.
[67:10.44]So I will be, and when we come back, a good question of what I'm going to do after that.
[67:19.61]I'll be on the Streamer Awards on Saturday.
[67:24.35]So I'll be hosting it.
[67:25.79]You'll probably be able to pick me out in the crowd.
[67:27.83]I'm sure you'll see me there at some point.
[67:32.89]Walking around.
[67:35.93]I'm also presenting.
[67:36.83]So.
[67:37.45]I think.
[67:40.17]I'm not hosting it.
[67:40.93]No.
[67:41.19]No.
[67:43.05]But I am.
[67:43.89]I'm going to be one of the presenters.
[67:46.71]What about baseball stream?
[67:49.87]Yeah.
[67:50.03]I got to get.
[67:50.63]I got to get a good suit and everything.
[67:51.89]Yeah.
[67:52.07]It's going to take.
[67:52.97]I need to spend the next day or two getting really ready for this.
[67:55.27]All right.
[67:57.63]Let me try this again.
[67:58.57]But yeah.
[67:58.95]In about 15-20 minutes.
[68:01.35]I'm going to take a break.
[68:04.74]It'll be a long one.
[68:05.33]And we'll come back with Elden Ring.
[68:36.91]No!
[68:37.05]16!
[68:37.13]Why is the controller so bad?
[68:38.41]Ah shit, I fucked it up.
[68:57.44]Let's quit, quit, quit, quit.
[68:58.88]I don't want to do this one.
[69:01.18]I don't care.
[69:01.58]Who cares about how many blocks you can count?
[69:03.04]Who cares?
[69:05.92]I'm gonna do that test.
[69:13.63]I want to do a different one.
[69:14.41]I don't want to do the block one again.
[69:15.57]You idiot.
[69:41.26]Thank you.
[70:21.32]Got it!
[70:54.06]Oh, shit.
[70:55.28]Mouse was... Hello?
[71:00.60]Ah!
[71:00.80]It's too much things!
[71:02.98]I don't care!
[71:30.44]no I want to do the monkey yeah oh my analytical brain oh no okay I can't analyze things you can't get all you can't have all the infinity stones sorry
[71:59.93]so
[72:30.68]God, fuck this game
[72:58.00]Okay, I can't play this anymore.
[73:00.22]Can you guys hear?
[73:02.02]It's coming out of my speakers.
[73:07.51]It's literally coming out of my monitor.
[73:12.51]I think I fucked up the whole sound thing.
[73:15.09]My sound is fucked up permanently.
[73:16.47]I have to play like this until I take a break.
[73:26.23]I'm gonna turn this off because, like, you can hear it here.
[73:29.59]Do you hear?
[73:31.45]So... Whatever.
[73:33.58]I don't care.
[73:36.30]I fucked everything up.
[74:39.80]Almost had it.
[74:40.68]Almost had it.
[74:41.38]It's too awkward.
[74:43.48]It's coming through my speakers and I can't fix it.
[74:46.22]I'll turn it up.
[74:51.48]Can you hear it now?
[74:52.76]You guys should be able to hear it now.
[74:55.40]Get the train to the exit.
[75:03.44]I think my noise gate is making it so you can't hear it.
[75:11.45]No, wrong controls!
[76:03.33]Whoa!
[76:03.63]I thought I was starting on the other side.
[76:09.85]Alright, let's see if I... My brain age went down because obviously... Obviously I got fucked up and I was under extenuating circumstances with this unplugged.
[76:22.66]I got a higher score than last time?
[76:26.75]How?
[76:31.03]A... S minus!
[76:33.37]I got to S, I don't care.
[76:34.51]I win.
[76:38.27]Let's take a closer look at the test results.
[76:40.38]I can't stand this, but it has to stay that way.
[76:42.80]Oh my god!
[76:44.34]There's a whole chunk of my brain missing!
[76:53.32]What the fuck?
[77:00.58]I'm not going to improve in analytics.
[77:02.40]It's not going to happen.
[77:10.63]That sounds so weird coming through here.
[77:14.15]Alright.
[77:16.29]We're about to take our break.
[77:19.35]In just a moment.
[77:20.57]In just a moment.
[77:26.59]That's fun.
[77:30.41]I can't get the weight thing down.
[77:31.83]L ratio brain.
[77:39.21]Whatever.
[77:42.39]I have such trouble with this.
[77:43.77]I always have.
[77:45.87]You want to talk about, okay, wow, dude, your spatial awareness.
[77:49.22]This is exactly what you should be talking about.
[77:52.84]I have trouble with, like, orientation of stuff.
[78:15.03]Okay.
[78:16.29]I'm being analytical about this.
[78:17.57]I'm not going fast.
[78:20.09]Oops.
[78:27.04]Okay.
[78:33.40]Okay.
[78:34.12]That's better than last time.
[78:40.43]I don't know, dude.
[78:41.29]I don't fucking know.
[78:43.20]I don't know.
[78:44.16]It sounds like you're making pop- When is this bit gonna end?
[78:46.76]I'm- I can't plug this back in.
[78:49.76]Uh, this- this took like five minutes to get in the right spot behind the monitor.
[78:54.22]So, I could hear it.
[78:55.98]It's not going back in.
[78:57.25]I can't do it.
[79:04.75]Sounds like somebody's breaking tiles in another room.
[79:11.12]I'm not going to be able to get gold on any of these.
[79:15.14]Hold on.
[79:15.56]Let me try to plug it back in.
[79:16.84]It's such a weird spot.
[79:25.13]I don't think I... Do you want to help me plug it in?
[79:27.27]Alright, here.
[79:28.89]Go back and play.
[79:29.65]I just can't see.
[79:30.77]Oh, yeah!
[79:38.59]She got it first try!
[79:42.02]This is so loud.
[79:42.80]I gotta turn this down.
[79:47.60]She's, like, sneaking back here.
[79:51.61]I'll see you in a bit.
[79:54.11]She's, like, sneaking around.
[79:55.49]I'll be really honest.
[79:59.53]I gotta be really honest.
[80:00.49]Holy shit.
[80:03.59]I don't even know how she just did that.
[80:07.29]I don't think you guys understand.
[80:08.27]There's, like...
[80:10.13]There's like six inches of space behind the desk.
[80:14.51]And she just was like, boom, bam, in, gone.
[80:17.72]That was un-fucking-believable.
[80:20.52]It took me like, it took me 15 minutes to get this plugged in.
[80:27.38]She's just fucking there.
[80:30.26]Isn't she great?
[80:33.52]That was cute.
[80:34.14]I love that.
[80:34.52]Alright.
[80:37.83]Just without even being seen either, she's just like gone.
[80:42.23]Sneak queen.
[80:43.01]All right.
[80:46.89]Two, four, six, seven.
[80:48.65]I'm going to throw it into the ground.
[81:06.68]Oh, she knows how to analyze shit.
[81:12.11]I just can't I'm sitting there like I'm sitting there with a plug just going like I don't understand how this goes in there I just I can't analyze how it plugs in I see it's small enough to fit in that hole but where is that hole he comes in here with an axe I'm dodging it all right start over again
[81:41.32]Game's muted?
[81:42.01]Oh.
[82:43.19]It has to be worth a gold medal.
[82:46.95]That's a gold medal.
[82:47.99]It has to be, right?
[82:49.01]Yes!
[82:49.53]Much better?
[82:50.21]Yeah.
[82:50.59]Okay, how about...
[83:13.48]Identify.
[83:14.44]I'll get... Okay.
[83:16.66]All gold medals give you something, right?
[83:45.01]Fuck you.
[83:46.81]What?
[84:26.27]That's gotta be gold, right?
[84:27.11]That has to be a gold medal.
[84:31.09]That's better than what I had before.
[84:32.21]Come on.
[84:32.59]Gold!
[84:35.31]Got it.
[84:43.27]Are you doing the stream?
[84:43.91]Yeah, I'll be at the stream rewards.
[84:46.46]Because I'm planning on it.
[84:49.06]Alright, compute.
[84:49.84]This one's just add up the numbers and that's it.
[84:53.80]Don't do anything else.
[85:55.93]I fucking can't do this one.
[85:57.93]I can't.
[85:59.23]No!
[85:59.81]I need gold.
[86:02.41]Do it again.
[86:03.43]Come on.
[86:04.21]I need 300.
[87:23.82]Bingo.
[87:25.64]That's gonna be huge.
[87:33.22]That's a triple gold medal.
[87:37.01]Perfect.
[87:42.73]Alright, come on.
[87:44.33]This one's weird with the analog.
[87:45.57]This would be way easier with a finger or a stylus.
[87:47.97]Time to 12.
[87:54.84]It's weird.
[88:02.99]180 minutes.
[88:03.29]6, 12.
[88:03.91]So it's backwards.
[88:12.13]80 minutes.
[88:12.75]6.
[88:13.11]Okay.
[88:14.27]Backwards.
[88:20.76]Forward, 6, 12, 18, so that's 3 hours ahead.
[88:22.40]1, 2, 3, plus 5.
[88:22.62]6, 12.
[88:22.70]So, 1, 2, 35 minutes.
[88:23.14]5, 10, 15, 20, 20, 30, here.
[88:23.40]Fall back, 6, 12.
[88:25.34]1, 2, right there.
[88:27.28]DO IT!
[88:52.51]I don't think that's gold.
[88:57.65]I don't think it's gold.
[89:01.71]I need to be, I need to do a little bit better than that.
[89:03.35]Come on, man.
[89:33.31]No controller!
[89:42.11]I fucking hate this thing.
[89:43.51]It's such a shit.
[90:16.81]There's a weird reverb on the mic?
[90:33.97]It's probably the fan.
[90:34.73]The fan's blowing into the mic.
[90:36.51]Is that the fan on?
[90:37.07]Alright, that's all golds.
[90:47.16]I could definitely get gold on this one.
[90:48.28]I only did it once.
[92:06.93]Alright, only two more.
[92:18.70]And I'm good.
[92:21.38]Okay, I gotta focus on this one.
[92:23.04]Don't be an idiot.
[92:45.59]Do it again.
[92:45.96]I'm never going to get it.
[93:43.64]Huh?
[93:54.41]Dude, I don't think I'll ever get that one past Silver.
[94:03.63]I need 400.
[94:04.72]I gotta do... I almost had it.
[94:07.37]I just gotta get it quick.
[94:09.05]Quick.
[94:48.92]SHIT!
[94:53.39]No, you're kidding me!
[94:54.17]You gotta be fucking kidding me!
[95:11.14]What the fuck, dude?
[95:12.94]How are you supposed to do that?
[95:14.95]How is it... How is that possible for you to get that in?
[95:17.15]I don't get it.
[95:17.87]400?
[95:18.71]I'll wait on the 4.
[95:27.12]This shit is just so... I can't do it.
[95:28.82]My brain just can't process it.
[95:30.16]I don't think I'm ever gonna get 400.
[95:41.19]Dude, I'm... It's like the... It's the segmentation that my brain just goes, you can't fucking do it.
[95:58.50]It's the segmented pieces down here that it's like, look, it's done up there, mom.
[96:02.36]It's like, no, I can't.
[96:03.96]My brain just can't do it.
[96:26.20]Um.
[96:29.12]Oh.
[96:30.14]Okay.
[96:35.34]Bro.
[96:35.96]I don't.
[96:36.58]I can't.
[96:37.34]I can't, dude.
[96:41.31]I can't.
[96:54.56]This is the one thing that I will never be able to do.
[96:58.06]Ever.
[97:02.40]The segmented pieces become one piece in my brain.
[97:05.46]And it's physically not possible for me to do it.
[97:11.34]Come on, dude.
[97:12.98]Try playing it drunk.
[97:14.58]That would actually probably help.
[97:24.56]They're all one piece.
[97:28.34]They're all one piece.
[97:29.56]My brain is mushing them all together.
[97:34.24]It's like I think they're all connected because they're all connected.
[97:36.98]Okay.
[97:37.62]You know what I wish they would do?
[97:39.63]I don't want to see the top one.
[97:41.25]The top one is fucking with my head.
[97:43.05]It's making them connected down here too.
[97:46.35]I'm going to literally block the top of the screen off.
[98:23.11]Fuck, it's happening again.
[98:55.58]Fuck!
[98:56.30]Did I get 400?
[98:59.54]Yay!
[99:01.62]Let go.
[99:03.78]Let go of me.
[99:07.19]Let go.
[99:07.93]Let go of me.
[99:08.47]Let go of me.
[99:09.21]Let go of me.
[99:30.44]Fuck.
[100:22.57]I got how far did I get?
[100:23.97]Oh my god, I thought I was really low on that scale.
[100:31.30]Minus 300.
[100:34.04]I got it!
[100:34.40]Okay, I got gold on everything.
[100:44.19]Super practice.
[100:45.37]In this harder practice, every activity starts in the advanced class.
[100:52.62]That's not happening.
[101:59.72]Jesus.
[101:59.90]Got it.
[102:29.77]Bet you can't do that.
[102:35.38]Sorry, I'm fucking out of here.
[102:38.96]I will see you guys in exactly... Exactly.
[102:49.78]Like 20 minutes.
[102:50.38]We're going to take a long break.
[102:52.32]I'm going to come back with Elden Ring.
[102:53.42]That was fun.
[102:58.47]This is the end of the first segment of this stream.
[103:01.25]I'm going to eat.
[103:03.27]I'm going to pee again.
[103:04.35]I'm going to refill my drink.
[103:06.33]Get a water.
[103:06.71]And I'll be back for Elden Ring.
[103:12.27]I'm going to play Elden Ring until I'm done.
[103:13.96]See you in about 20 minutes.
[103:17.18]I'm going to put text on the screen too just because I want to make sure people know that I'm not coming right back.
[103:28.04]Let's solve that now.
[103:33.86]That to where it needs to be.
[103:34.92]Okay, I'm going to add some text on the screen.
[103:38.83]This is an intermission.
[103:41.49]There you go.
[104:01.32]I'll see you guys in about 15-20 minutes.
[104:07.75]It might even be shorter than that.
[104:13.57]Include where you left.
[104:15.97]Oh, that's a good part.
[104:16.57]That's a good idea.
[104:18.71]I don't know.
[104:19.15]I'll write this.
[104:19.57]15-20 minute break.
[104:21.23]I'll say back at 6.40 Pacific.
[104:31.36]There you go.
[104:32.94]That makes more sense.
[104:39.43]Let's see how this plays out.
[104:46.13]So, I'll be right back.
[104:47.49]I'm not going to have any music because I don't think it'll... It'll just be looping for like 20 minutes.
[104:52.86]Let's make this really easy to see.
[104:59.90]Alright, I'll be right back.
[105:01.57]I'll see you guys at 640-ish.
[105:02.39]Let's see how this plays out.
[105:05.23]I'm really curious how this works.
[105:07.71]No music?
[105:08.25]Do random music?
[105:11.18]Um... I feel like it's going to loop the same thing.
[105:14.58]Nah, this is alright.
[105:15.74]Alright, I'll be right back.
[105:17.61]20 minutes.
[105:18.23]Tops.
[105:18.99]Probably less.
