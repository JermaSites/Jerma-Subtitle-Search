[00:06.63]Big Brain Academy is installed.
[00:14.28]We're not going to play it yet.
[00:18.26]Not yet.
[00:18.86]That was fast.
[00:25.99]It was.
[00:26.91]Did I jump scare you?
[00:30.95]I'm sorry.
[00:31.41]I'm just ready to get back into... I'm going to play one more Picross level, and then we're going to open Big Brain Academy, okay?
[00:36.17]Okay.
[00:40.29]One final Picross level.
[00:44.33]Agravas.
[00:47.19]Oh, shit.
[00:49.17]I clicked.
[00:49.55]Alright, never mind.
[00:50.21]I'm playing Big Brain Academy now, apparently.
[00:53.19]I clicked that button.
[00:54.33]I did the... I closed it.
[00:56.39]Alright.
[00:58.63]Big Brain Academy.
[01:00.07]Brain versus brain.
[01:04.22]Here we go.
[01:15.52]Big Brain Academy is not Brain Age.
[01:18.40]What?
[01:21.14]What are you talking about?
[01:21.90]This is not Brain Age?
[01:23.09]Wait, how many brain games are there?
[01:26.75]What do you mean wrong game?
[01:27.91]I bought the wrong game.
[01:29.41]Big Brain?
[01:30.29]Big Brain!
[01:31.23]What?
[01:34.43]What are you talking about?
[01:35.40]There's another one?
[01:37.06]Uh...
[01:43.70]Brain age is not available on the Switch in North America.
[01:47.62]This is the one we're playing.
[01:50.92]Yeah, me, me, Johnny500.
[01:57.95]Okay.
[01:59.05]Do you feel as if your brain has been a bit more stiff than usual?
[02:04.24]Well, here at the Academy, we offer a variety of activities to help you stretch and flex that brain of yours.
[02:08.86]This game is good, don't worry.
[02:09.88]Okay.
[02:10.02]Okay.
[02:12.13]So without further ado, let's get started stretching your brain.
[02:15.91]To begin, we'll enroll you in the academy.
[02:17.64]So if you would, tell us about yourself.
[02:19.62]How old are you?
[02:20.22]I've never fucking asked that question.
[02:25.80]Fuck.
[02:31.77]No, I'm not that old.
[02:33.09]I'm like fucking 32, man.
[02:35.55]I'm like 34.
[02:35.85]I'm too old.
[02:41.54]Yeah, I was born on January 1st, 1988.
[02:43.50]1987.
[02:44.18]1986.
[02:44.20]1985.
[02:44.34]Okay.
[02:44.64]Who cares?
[02:45.48]Tell us your style.
[02:49.44]Oh.
[02:55.18]Okay.
[03:02.59]Your occupation.
[03:03.37]Choose something close to your real occupation.
[03:08.85]Um...
[03:11.49]Okay, preschooler, grade schooler, middle schooler, high schooler, college student, student of life.
[03:18.59]I'm a business owner.
[03:21.47]Self-employed.
[03:22.09]Free agent.
[03:26.25]I'm a business owner.
[03:29.21]I'm a business owner, free agent, self-employed office worker.
[03:32.09]Just combine them.
[03:34.93]Self-employed.
[03:38.47]Next up, your catchphrase.
[03:39.77]You can change this later, so just pick anything that strikes you.
[03:44.43]Uh... Buried in homework.
[03:47.29]Send help.
[03:49.73]But you forgot, like, the crying emoji.
[03:51.33]Can't say no to candy.
[03:56.79]I have only one speed, and it's easy, does it?
[03:59.59]That's kind of accurate.
[04:04.09]Gotta finish strong.
[04:05.19]I'll do it to- Or that.
[04:09.57]I only have one speed and it's easy, does it?
[04:11.50]I'll do it tomorrow.
[04:15.40]How do grown-ups get to have all the fun?
[04:17.06]It's funny how the ages, the different age groups.
[04:22.16]This is like for a kid to say this.
[04:24.22]Is it a launch day?
[04:25.06]Why do grown-ups get all the fun?
[04:28.39]Like a grown-up's not supposed to pick that.
[04:29.77]Comfort is key.
[04:33.45]Can't be too careful.
[04:35.62]It's simple.
[04:36.14]Be sincere.
[04:36.84]I like to be liked.
[04:38.46]Why make only one mistake?
[04:43.34]I'm a fan of being a fan.
[04:45.13]My grandkids are the cutest.
[04:46.55]Horses are better than people.
[04:53.95]Check the appearance you prefer while attending our academy.
[04:56.27]You can change this later as well, so don't fret.
[04:57.90]Okay.
[04:59.58]Okay.
[05:12.97]Hold on.
[05:15.25]That's pretty close.
[05:18.67]Close.
[05:33.10]That's not bad either.
[05:38.12]Which one?
[05:40.22]It's this one.
[05:40.90]It has to be.
[05:44.15]Okay, facial hair.
[05:48.47]No, I don't have facial hair.
[05:52.41]Uh, Jerma985 green.
[05:53.27]Sure.
[05:53.49]Sure.
[06:02.26]Alright, I'm done.
[06:08.99]Also, allow me to introduce our online features.
[06:11.49]You can compete with others in Ghost Clash.
[06:13.12]I don't want to do that.
[06:13.74]Fuck off.
[06:14.88]Are you comfortable with photographs of bugs?
[06:21.02]What?
[06:24.28]This often prevents photographs of some creepy critters from appearing.
[06:27.32]What do you mean, bugs?
[06:36.23]Okay, practice.
[06:36.89]Let's go.
[06:39.05]Let's begin by stretching and flexing your brain in practice.
[06:44.73]Tada, welcome to practice.
[06:45.55]It's our specialty here at the Academy.
[06:47.57]If I may, I suggest you start by trying an activity in the identify category.
[06:51.45]Sure.
[06:54.32]Why not give whack match a try?
[06:58.28]You can play with either button or touch.
[07:00.44]I'm gonna play with buttons.
[07:02.36]Whack the mole with the matching picture.
[07:07.86]That's like kind of depressing.
[07:08.98]Okay.
[07:10.16]Just click the things.
[07:10.88]Alright.
[07:12.16]It's easy.
[07:14.00]Alright.
[07:42.38]I need a facecam for this, don't I?
[07:44.52]Yeah, no, no, no, I got it, I got it.
[07:47.43]I got, I need, I distracted myself.
[08:11.53]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[08:12.98]I need a facecam.
[08:13.74]I gotta put clothes on.
[08:14.56]Hold on.
[08:15.24]You guys need to be able to see my face for this.
[08:17.28]One sec.
[08:17.54]I just need a shirt.
[09:55.07]Okay, I'm back.
[09:56.23]Let me just make sure this looks alright.
[09:57.71]Which it should.
[10:00.11]How's it look?
[10:06.34]Does it look alright?
[10:09.60]Too dark.
[10:11.52]Why is it so dark?
[10:26.34]Oh shit.
[10:26.92]Hold on, I gotta change the setting here.
[10:28.34]Hold on.
[10:33.73]Wasn't planning on this.
[10:36.33]Put the light on?
[10:36.99]I do have a light on.
[10:37.77]Every webcam that's been created has got some of the worst light controls ever.
[10:49.45]That's better.
[10:50.86]Bye.
[10:54.70]Alright.
[11:03.21]Let's go!
[11:03.47]You ready?
[11:06.23]This is gonna stay on for Elden Ring anyways.
[11:12.47]It's a delay.
[11:13.11]Oh shit, that's right.
[11:13.91]Hold on, I gotta fix that.
[11:20.98]I didn't even check to make sure that that was actually working, by the way.
[11:34.07]There we go.
[11:35.01]Alright, we actually have to test this to make sure that everything's synced up correctly.
[11:37.91]Because when you pull a console through a capture card, it just delays it.
[11:45.45]That's good, right?
[11:47.06]One!
[11:47.84]Two!
[11:48.68]Three!
[11:51.34]I did pretty good.
[11:53.24]Alright, one gold lobe metal.
[11:57.98]Alright.
[12:03.56]this is actually kind of this is gonna be fun uh no try to collect all the gold lobe metals alright so that was just one alright that was a cool thing your journey towards impressive big brain bronze scores just began
[12:29.70]Alright.
[12:29.94]I'll just keep doing it.
[12:32.66]What about memorize, analyze, compute?
[12:35.15]Oh wait, we need to test this.
[12:36.01]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[12:37.05]Is it in sync?
[12:38.93]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[12:39.23]No?
[12:39.63]Your video's later?
[12:40.87]Is it close enough?
[13:01.72]game is late I'm going alright let me try this one two one two three one two one two three better
[13:34.24]Alright, flash memory.
[13:35.24]Let's try this one.
[13:38.74]Use the buttons.
[13:41.12]What were the numbers and symbols?
[13:46.92]What?
[13:47.26]5, 6, 6.
[13:48.95]It's just showing it to me.
[13:53.19]6.
[13:53.83]Oh, okay.
[13:54.33]I get it.
[14:36.62]What the fuck?
[14:37.18]I didn't- What?
[14:39.27]What?
[14:40.81]I didn't want to go forward that other way.
[14:42.29]Dude, I didn't want to go- I pressed the button accidentally one more time.
[14:57.14]Alright, that was fun.
[15:03.41]Focus up.
[15:04.09]I'm focusing.
[15:05.11]I just pressed the... I... By the way... Would you like to see the perfect controller?
[15:14.48]This is perfect.
[15:15.70]In every way.
[15:18.16]Hand placement.
[15:20.44]Analog placement.
[15:23.89]The face buttons.
[15:27.87]I thought you just got mad at it.
[15:29.27]Yeah, but I got mad at me because I pressed the button accidentally.
[15:32.27]One more time.
[15:36.68]I actually think this is... The one thing I would change on this is the triggers, I think, should have a little bit more give.
[15:42.06]But placement-wise and hand placement, I like it the most.
[15:44.52]The pro controller.
[15:49.69]The PS5 controller is the best one, right?
[15:51.35]I mean, that's simple.
[15:52.71]Alright, which one is heavier?
[15:59.72]Oh.
[16:49.33]I don't know.
[16:50.25]There's too many things, too many colors.
[16:51.49]That's too many colors.
[16:59.49]Literally, I can't do this.
[17:02.61]Too many different things are on the screen.
[17:07.82]Nice Omega March shirt.
[17:13.94]Oh, you noticed!
[17:14.52]There it is.
[17:18.19]That was really cool.
[17:21.38]I got three medals.
[17:23.58]Wow.
[17:29.70]There's more?
[17:32.02]Choose two cards that add up to the numbers shown at the top.
[17:36.09]So it's just addition.
[17:36.99]It doesn't matter what animal it is?
[18:26.68]What, that wasn't nine?
[18:27.38]Oh, um... Ah!
[18:41.89]I can't!
[18:42.33]So many colors!
[18:51.54]Oh my god, he's stupid.
[18:53.20]No, I'm a visual learner.
[18:56.67]Okay?
[18:57.41]You- I'm gonna destroy- Here's the thing.
[18:59.44]People are gonna talk all this shit.
[19:01.28]I am going to destroy one of these.
[19:05.62]And you people are gonna think there's something wrong with me.
[19:07.24]You're gonna think I'm cheating.
[19:09.28]There's like one learning category that I'm gonna do really good in and I'm gonna get like ultra advanced.
[19:14.17]Ultra advanced.
[19:15.47]The rest of these are gonna be like at a fourth grade level.
[19:21.35]This is not one of them.
[19:22.81]This is not one of them.
[19:23.60]I know this.
[19:24.32]I've had- I've taken this test before.
[19:31.37]What?
[20:07.67]a little one but that was every single piece
[20:39.86]Being a visual learner was proven to be bullshit.
[20:41.98]Only people made it up.
[20:54.75]Only intermediate.
[20:56.13]I'm not good at this kind of stuff.
[20:58.41]Just wait till I get to the fucking numbers and I'm gonna destroy it and I'm gonna make you all look foolish.
[21:04.13]How would it look if you looked at it from the direction of the arrow?
[22:21.53]That one hurts my head.
[22:27.62]Slow down.
[22:28.14]Isn't there a timer?
[22:33.60]There's a timer.
[22:34.36]Isn't it like tick, tick, tick?
[22:37.96]I hear like a clock ticking.
[22:40.59]There is a timer.
[22:41.23]Yeah, there is.
[22:45.33]Add the missing tracks.
[22:46.35]Alright, let's fucking look.
[22:47.55]Let's look at an idiot.
[22:51.46]What do you mean, add the track?
[22:53.31]Oh.
[22:54.95]Why would they...
[23:51.04]No!
[23:51.32]I didn't want to press that one!
[23:54.22]Seriously, it's really sensitive.
[23:57.18]Sometimes it goes like double, or it doesn't go at all.
[24:02.60]I was trying to move, but sometimes it would go like and tick twice.
[24:06.44]This D-pad sucks.
[24:07.50]This controller sucks.
[24:08.70]It's got good placement, that's all.
[24:22.73]Oh my god, it's perfect.
[24:25.85]Uh, yeah, I'll put on sunglasses, cool.
[24:30.41]Alright, nice.
[24:33.77]So that was memorize, this is analyze.
[24:35.57]I'm gonna look really bad to a lot of people.
[24:46.42]People are gonna think like I'm on drugs or something.
[24:54.77]Speed sorting.
[24:58.59]Which picture fits the description?
[25:00.71]Plant.
[25:03.49]Living.
[25:04.27]Plant.
[25:05.35]Fish.
[25:06.73]Doesn't swim with fins?
[25:11.05]Wait, what does that mean?
[25:11.81]I don't get it.
[25:12.45]I don't, what does it mean?
[25:14.91]Doesn't swim with fins.
[25:15.69]What does that mean?
[25:23.55]No, I want to do the car.
[25:24.75]What the fuck?
[25:26.17]A fucking ladybug is not... I gotta start using the analog.
[25:36.61]That's worse somehow.
[26:00.96]What was that?
[26:01.38]Was it a mole?
[26:02.22]It was an eggplant!
[26:11.65]I thought it was a muscle!
[26:19.67]I wanna do that one again.
[26:20.31]I wanna do this one again.
[26:33.32]Okay, I thought that was like a celestial body.
[26:38.80]Those are fins.
[26:42.03]No!
[26:43.33]I didn't want to press that.
[27:05.38]For some reason, I didn't think pig was a mammal.
[27:07.02]I thought it was a trick question for some reason.
[27:08.33]I was like, what is it then?
[27:13.47]Um, I don't know.
[27:14.19]What else is cold-blooded?
[27:15.11]A bug's cold-blooded?
[27:25.98]I can't hit it to relax.
[27:37.14]Are bugs cold-blooded?
[27:38.86]I'm serious.
[27:40.66]I don't know.
[27:41.98]You only hear that for like lizards and shit.
[27:44.98]I don't fucking know.
[27:46.61]The bugs don't even have blood.
[27:48.03]They have like fucking... They have like cerebral fluid and that's it.
[27:51.31]Bugs don't have blood?
[27:52.17]They have like a little bit of like juice in their head.
[28:16.66]Shark is not a fish, I thought.
[28:18.26]I thought that was a big debate.
[28:27.73]These eat things?
[28:33.79]No!
[28:35.65]I thought it said move with legs.
[28:44.83]A tricycle is, what do you mean, slower than a bug?
[28:47.35]Fourth slowest?
[29:08.28]No!
[29:08.98]The fucking D-pad sucks!
[29:16.73]I wanna go like this way, and I go like up left, up left, up left, up left.
[29:20.31]It's like up left, up left, up left.
[29:21.71]I'm just trying to go right, man!
[29:22.83]One more try, that's it.
[29:54.55]Okay, I didn't know the octopus laid eggs.
[30:29.34]Oh, I got it.
[30:29.88]Alright, that was super elite.
[30:44.47]Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[30:48.93]Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[30:50.37]Alright, Match Blast.
[30:59.12]This is fun, damn.
[31:00.90]Break blocks to copy the top shape.
[31:05.33]I get it.
[32:08.99]That was too hard.
[32:13.92]That was too hard.
[32:14.64]That was way too much.
[32:19.34]I fucking guarantee if you try to hit me with a sword, I could dodge it.
[32:23.02]I fucking guarantee it.
[32:24.24]If you had a fucking battle axe and you were going to try to get me with it, you're not going to get me with it.
[32:28.69]I'm too fast for you.
[32:29.83]Way too fast.
[32:30.35]No way.
[32:34.67]I am fast as fuck and I have lightning-like reflexes in real life.
[32:39.01]I don't care what some little fucking grasshopper says about how stupid I am.
[32:44.93]You got a swing of the axe?
[32:47.57]I'm fucking gone.
[32:49.58]Not happening.
[33:03.88]I've been playing too many video games.
[33:10.77]Why is that the first thing I go to?
[33:12.34]I've been playing too much Elden Ring.
[33:13.48]I really have.
[33:14.12]I've been playing too many video games.
[33:18.34]Alright, how many cubes are there?
[33:22.45]Three.
[33:54.68]What the 16 of them?
[34:15.64]I can't concentrate!
[34:18.70]18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
[34:22.12]I can't concentrate.
[34:23.00]I can't concentrate.
[34:24.36]I don't like this one.
[34:27.41]I actually can't concentrate.
[34:28.63]I'm fine.
[34:32.29]I'm okay.
[34:32.81]I just can't concentrate.
[34:34.79]I have huge concentration problems ever since I was a little child.
[34:39.96]You got me with an axe!
[34:41.90]And I'm fucking gonna dodge it!
[34:55.57]Alright, how about compute?
[34:57.71]There's more under memorize.
[34:59.09]Memo random.
[35:01.73]Memorize the picture on the car before it flips.
[35:03.41]Which one was it?
[35:04.11]I should be- I'm gonna do- We're gonna get super late on this one.
[35:07.84]What?
[35:14.48]Wait!
[35:14.86]Oh, it's the one that flips over.
[35:15.96]Okay, I didn't understand the rules.
[35:31.95]Oh, fucking come on!
[35:33.14]I went to no-
[36:00.27]I didn't even fucking look at what it was.
[36:01.93]Slow down.
[36:02.95]I didn't understand the rules at the first few rounds of this.
[36:15.34]Where's my...
[36:28.70]Alright, reverse retention.
[36:30.95]Remember the order and answer in reverse.
[37:49.82]You should see the face you're making.
[37:51.02]I don't care.
[37:54.28]This game is fun and everything, but what would happen if somebody came into the sky with an axe?
[37:58.56]I'll tell you what would happen.
[38:00.11]They wouldn't hit me.
[38:02.79]I would be on the other side of the room.
[38:05.37]It would be like Dark Souls 3 in real life.
[38:07.55]It would be like, oh, I'm coming this way!
[38:09.11]And I'd fucking, yoink!
[38:10.87]I would dodge it with perfect frame rate.
[38:12.95]Perfect frame invulnerability.
[38:17.93]Covered cages.
[38:20.65]Where are the birds?
[38:21.35]Make the cages go faster if you're up for it.
[38:23.13]I get it, okay.
[38:27.66]Already gone.
[39:33.17]I didn't get to super elite?
[39:42.53]Ooh, he was happy about that one.
[39:47.45]Legit based elite brain.
[39:50.59]Thank you.
[39:50.93]Alright, okay, alright.
[39:54.54]So what do I do now?
[39:56.58]Oh, okay.
[39:57.96]Practice, test.
[40:00.58]Wait, I haven't seen all these.
[40:04.53]Alright, here we go.
[40:05.01]Species... Which animal is there more of?
[40:08.75]Look around with the spotlight.
[40:09.83]I just... I don't need them.
[40:30.73]They're the same!
[41:23.85]Not even super elite.
[41:29.99]I wonder if this guy could definitely dodge Battle Axe.
[41:32.57]I could.
[41:43.56]Which piece belongs in the box?
[41:45.28]Pay attention.
[41:55.78]Get it.
[42:07.43]Oh, I didn't want to pick that one.
[42:08.91]I'm getting frustrated.
[42:38.96]It gives me a fucking headache.
[42:45.64]I like know it too.
[42:46.74]I can see it, but my brain just can't do it.
[42:50.74]I can see it.
[42:51.48]It's just like mushing it all over together.
[42:55.61]I can't.
[42:58.87]I just can't do it, man.
[43:00.15]It's just like it just mushes in my brain.
[43:04.24]It's like I start looking at all of them at the same time.
[43:06.48]My brain sees all of them.
[43:08.45]And yo, I'm dodging that.
[43:10.39]He's peeking.
[43:13.01]I'm fine.
[43:13.63]Okay, fast focus.
[43:20.98]What is the picture of?
[43:21.80]How fast can you figure it out?
[43:39.81]It's a rabbit.
[43:40.51]It's a hippo.
[43:47.64]Owl.
[43:48.28]Snail!
[43:56.99]What?!
[44:00.59]Eggaroo.
[44:11.27]Is it a dog?
[44:11.91]It's a dog.
[44:16.52]Mouse.
[44:24.16]I don't know.
[44:24.58]A butterfly?
[44:25.38]What the fuck is that?
[44:26.84]What is that?
[44:27.60]Snake.
[44:30.48]I'll try it again.
[44:38.17]I like that one.
[44:38.75]That one's fun.
[44:49.93]Again, I like that one.
[44:56.82]It was the concrete that fucked me up.
[45:17.13]No, I didn't want to press it.
[45:18.63]I wanted to press Panda.
[45:19.63]I guess it's a cat?
[45:40.50]It could have been a snail.
[45:58.01]How the fuck are you supposed to do that?
[46:03.53]One more.
[46:06.16]This whole game could be contained in a 10 megabyte Flash website from 2008.
[46:10.26]I mean, that's kind of funny what you just said, but...
[46:28.73]Goat.
[46:30.11]Owl.
[46:30.57]It's probably seal or fish.
[46:35.29]Probably seal.
[46:36.71]Seal.
[46:43.72]Owl.
[46:43.90]Giraffe.
[46:45.02]Ostrich?
[46:45.48]I don't know what this is.
[47:01.09]I don't think you can blur it any harder.
[47:02.82]What is that?
[47:03.42]Fucking panda.
[47:26.48]I wasn't pretending.
[47:27.10]I was looking at the middle because the panda was facing the other way.
[47:30.10]It was like the back.
[47:30.90]It was like the back of a panda.
[47:41.05]I haven't seen a panda very much in my life either.
[47:42.73]No.
[47:42.81]Alright.
[47:44.61]That was cool.
[47:46.05]So now we do.
[47:46.81]There's a couple we didn't do and visualize.
[47:48.49]We're going to do this one.
[47:50.55]Shadow shift.
[47:51.55]Find the pictures that match the shadows.
[47:53.25]Okay.
[48:13.66]No, I didn't want to click it.
[48:16.15]The round head.
[48:51.49]Who else is in there?
[49:04.32]You got something on the top of your screen?
[49:06.76]What is it?
[49:08.52]Tell me what it is so I can be aware of what it is.
[49:09.96]Okay, I have to read it in a log clock.
[49:20.04]Mullet Math.
[49:21.27]What is that?
[49:21.69]Oh, Mallet Math.
[49:22.99]Whack the blocks you don't need to leave behind the correct total.
[49:25.51]I need four.
[49:49.61]three, six, nine, 12, five, 10, 14, 21, seven, 14, 21, six, six, seven, eight, five, six, seven, five, eight, nine, 10, nine, 10.
[50:18.83]No!
[50:19.35]I didn't want to do that.
[50:20.41]Why did it fucking move?
[50:22.37]I wanted to get rid of the other one.
[50:30.00]21.
[50:30.02]21, 21.
[50:30.20]No, I didn't.
[50:34.50]Seriously, sometimes it just goes.
[50:36.22]I'm not trying to press the button.
[50:41.05]You dodged into it.
[50:41.75]Okay.
[50:48.17]Rotate the clock hands to match the time.
[50:49.73]Spring forward an hour.
[51:01.78]Fall back 15 minutes.
[51:05.22]Uh oh.
[51:12.28]Fall back 30 minutes.
[51:13.18]Fall back 240 minutes.
[51:29.95]Go forward 120 minutes.
[51:33.35]Where did I start?
[51:38.92]Bring forward 245 minutes.
[51:40.06]5, 10, 15, 20.
[51:40.26]It's weird on the controller.
[51:57.48]Look.
[51:58.38]Let me show you what happens.
[51:59.32]Let me show you what happens when I use the... It's weird on the controller.
[52:02.11]You're supposed to fucking touch that.
[52:05.05]Like, it's weird.
[52:06.55]Like, I can't... It's really weird on the controller.
[52:12.24]I swear to God.
[52:14.24]Up from lowest to highest.
[52:28.26]Thank you.
[53:00.48]negative 80 what dude I hate this controls I'm trying to I get start over start over start over start over start over
[53:26.89]This D-pad sucks, asshole.
[53:28.45]It's fucking the worst D-pad of any controller.
[53:41.14]Use the analog stick.
[53:42.18]Analog stick is awful here.
[54:09.06]Oh!
[54:38.43]That was negative 71!
[54:50.04]Fuck you!
[54:54.60]I give up.
[54:54.92]I don't care.
[54:55.76]Who gives a shit?
[54:56.30]Who fucking- What does this even matter?
[54:57.94]Brain- Oh, brain training.
[55:00.34]Who gives a shit?
[55:01.44]What does this matter?
[55:02.56]Why does this even matter?
[55:03.54]Like, this whole thing doesn't make any- Who cares?
[55:06.94]What specific case does it matter if I can pop balloons in a certain order if they like are tricked to make you look bigger and smaller?
[55:13.95]You know what is practical?
[55:15.17]I'll tell you what's practical.
[55:17.24]A guy running at you with an axe and you got nowhere to go.
[55:20.82]That's what I call practical fucking things to know.
[55:24.65]I'm telling you, dodging, dashing, and shit, like that- Oh no!
[55:28.81]Here comes the fucking battle axe!
[55:30.95]Open up!
[55:31.53]One, two, three, four- No, you're gone.
[55:34.36]Sorry, buddy.
[55:35.80]I know practical shit.
[55:37.06]I don't care about impractical shit, like counting balloons in a room of various shapes and colors.
[55:41.88]Let's take the test.
[55:50.51]Let's measure your big brain brawn by having you compete activities in five categories.
[55:58.35]I'm going double headphones.
[56:03.08]Memorize the numbers and symbols, repeat them before you forget.
[57:16.83]Alright, identify.
[57:18.57]No!
[57:19.08]Which piece belongs in the box?
[57:20.42]Pay attention to the movement.
[57:21.52]I'm gonna- Shut up!
[58:27.52]I'M LOSING POINTS!!
[58:28.56]Uh-oh.
[58:43.02]Number of cubes.
[58:43.75]The number of cubes.
[59:27.18]I think I did pretty good.
[59:54.75]Alright, let's go with the train one.
[59:55.90]I was good at this one too.
[60:37.80]Oops.
[60:38.14]Oops, I'm fucking- I'm flopping here.
[60:54.72]I had it.
[61:06.82]I gotta move with it.
[61:07.78]That's how I do everything.
[61:08.59]Alright, computing time.
[61:11.61]Alright.
[61:12.27]This is gonna be bad, but it's alright.
[61:38.93]No!
[61:39.39]I didn't want to go up again!
[61:41.09]Fucking controller!
[61:51.82]What are you doing?
[62:24.77]Well done.
[62:26.27]How'd I do?
[62:27.05]How was your first test?
[62:28.41]Your test results are reflected in your big brain score.
[62:30.53]Alright.
[62:34.51]My big brain score is 3300.
[62:36.21]An average person who hasn't spent time in practice will score about 1500.
[62:43.33]So, I practiced, so I should be somewhere around two or three thousand.
[62:59.29]2886!
[62:59.31]This is a very good score.
[63:02.53]Time to give your brain a grade.
[63:09.90]A++ dude.
[63:10.86]You're getting started.
[63:14.06]Let's aim for even higher.
[63:15.26]You can't get higher than A++.
[63:17.96]I told you I was a visual learner.
[63:30.67]I'm very, my analytics are terrible.
[63:36.93]But I can visualize, compute, and identify an attack.
[63:42.93]I'm gonna lay into this.
[63:43.69]I don't need to memorize anything, I don't need to analyze anything.
[63:53.37]Visualize, it is important to accurately perceive that which you see with your eyes.
[63:58.68]Furthermore, there's room for improvement in Analyze.
[64:01.26]I recommend flexing and stretching there.
[64:05.52]What is Analyze?
[64:06.88]If you can answer a little faster, you'll be better.
[64:10.79]Tell me, have you been collecting gold, low metals?
[64:13.13]I have no doubt you're capable of acquiring more.
[64:14.71]Well then, it's time to announce your big brain type.
[64:20.19]This is your brain type.
[64:22.52]Visualizing and computing.
[64:27.11]see it, and I can compute it, and I can attack it.
[64:32.40]Visualization and computation.
[64:34.68]Battleaxe brain Andy.
[64:41.08]That was fun.
[64:55.25]So I can do more?
[64:56.49]What is this?
[64:56.89]I wonder what that button does.
[64:59.05]Try to earn gold medals in every practice activity.
[65:06.11]Do a ghost clash.
[65:08.93]I don't think I pay for the Switch Online.
[65:11.40]I don't think I have it.
[65:14.68]I'm pretty sure I don't have, like... I think I stopped it.
[65:24.20]So wait, this is apparently what I'm bad at.
[65:27.18]That makes sense.
[65:29.80]Is it though?
[65:30.34]I crushed this.
[65:33.98]You had it from Mario Tennis.
[65:38.25]Didn't I crush this in the actual exam?
[65:42.09]This was bad.
[65:43.15]So was this.
[65:43.59]I nailed it.
[65:47.49]I got to look super elite.
[65:50.28]When are you gonna play Elden Ring?
[65:51.87]Well, I'll tell you.
[65:53.65]In... Literally like 5 minutes, 10 minutes.
[65:57.63]I'm gonna take a break, and it's gonna be a long break.
[65:59.91]It's gonna be somewhere over 15 to 20 minutes.
[66:02.62]I'm gonna eat.
[66:05.36]I'm gonna chill.
[66:05.88]And come back in about 15 plus 20, just probably about 20 minutes.
[66:11.36]And we're gonna come back and play Elden Ring for the rest of the night.
[66:14.34]So there's gonna be an intermission for food.
[66:15.62]Because I started at like 1.
[66:17.44]And I want to be able to go till like, you know, 11, 12, 1 a.m.
[66:22.26]I have like a 10 to 12 hour stream, but I want to eat in the middle and go, you know, if I need to do things I can.
[66:28.90]So I'll be playing it in like 25 minutes, 30 minutes.
[66:33.30]It's gonna be a long one?
[66:34.16]Well, the reason why I did a long stream today, specifically, specifically, so, is because I'm not gonna be around for the next, like, week.
[66:49.05]And I really want to play Elden Ring.
[66:51.13]So the idea was to break it up a little bit and play something else that's not Elden Ring, but I still wanted to play Elden Ring because I'm obsessed with it.
[66:58.34]And I don't want to not play Elden Ring for, like, the next five straight days.
[67:02.78]You know what I mean?
[67:04.10]Like, I could have just played this and then, like, done the Streamer Awards stuff because that's this weekend.
[67:09.38]So that's why I'm not going to be around.
[67:10.44]So I will be, and when we come back, a good question of what I'm going to do after that.
[67:19.61]I'll be on the Streamer Awards on Saturday.
[67:24.35]So I'll be hosting it.
[67:25.79]You'll probably be able to pick me out in the crowd.
[67:27.83]I'm sure you'll see me there at some point.
[67:32.89]Walking around.
[67:35.93]I'm also presenting.
[67:36.83]So.
[67:37.45]I think.
[67:40.17]I'm not hosting it.
[67:40.93]No.
[67:41.19]No.
[67:43.05]But I am.
[67:43.89]I'm going to be one of the presenters.
[67:46.71]What about baseball stream?
[67:49.87]Yeah.
[67:50.03]I got to get.
[67:50.63]I got to get a good suit and everything.
[67:51.89]Yeah.
[67:52.07]It's going to take.
[67:52.97]I need to spend the next day or two getting really ready for this.
[67:55.27]Alright.
[67:57.63]Let me try this again.
[67:58.57]But yeah.
[67:58.95]In about 15-20 minutes.
[68:01.35]I'm going to take a break.
[68:04.74]It'll be a long one.
[68:05.33]And we'll come back with Elden Ring.
[68:36.91]No!
[68:37.05]16!
[68:37.13]Why is the controller so bad?
[68:38.41]Ah shit, I fucked it up.
[68:57.44]Let's quit, quit, quit, quit.
[68:58.88]I don't want to do this one.
[69:01.18]I don't care.
[69:01.58]Who cares about how many blocks you can count?
[69:03.04]Who cares?
[69:05.92]I'm gonna do that test.
[69:13.63]I want to do a different one.
[69:14.41]I don't want to do the block one again.
[69:15.57]You idiot.
[69:41.26]Thank you.
[70:21.32]Got it!
[70:54.06]Oh, shit.
[70:55.28]Mouse was... Hello?
[71:00.60]Ah!
[71:00.80]It's too much things!
[71:02.98]I don't care!
[71:30.44]no I want to do the monkey yeah oh my analytical brain oh no okay I can't analyze things you can't get all you can't have all the infinity stones sorry
[71:59.93]so
[72:30.68]God, fuck this game
[72:58.00]Okay, I can't play this anymore.
[73:00.22]Can you guys hear?
[73:02.02]It's coming out of my speakers.
[73:07.51]It's literally coming out of my monitor.
[73:12.51]I think I fucked up the whole sound thing.
[73:15.09]My sound is fucked up permanently.
[73:16.47]I have to play like this until I take a break.
[73:26.23]I'm gonna turn this off because, like, you can hear it here.
[73:29.59]Do you hear?
[73:31.45]So... Whatever.
[73:33.58]I don't care.
[73:36.30]I fucked everything up.
[74:39.80]Almost had it.
[74:40.68]Almost had it.
[74:41.38]It's too awkward.
[74:43.48]It's coming through my speakers and I can't fix it.
[74:46.22]I'll turn it up.
[74:51.48]Can you hear it now?
[74:52.76]You guys should be able to hear it now.
[74:55.40]Get the train to the exit.
[75:03.44]I think my noise gate is making it so you can't hear it.
[75:11.45]No, wrong controls!
[76:03.33]Whoa!
[76:03.63]I thought I was starting on the other side.
[76:09.85]Alright, let's see if I... My brain age went down because obviously... Obviously I got fucked up and I was under extenuating circumstances with this unplugged.
[76:22.66]I got a higher score than last time?
[76:26.75]How?
[76:31.03]A... S minus!
[76:33.37]I got to S, I don't care.
[76:34.51]I win.
[76:38.27]Let's take a closer look at the test results.
[76:40.38]I can't stand this, but it has to stay that way.
[76:42.80]Oh my god!
[76:44.34]There's a whole chunk of my brain missing!
[76:53.32]What the fuck?
[77:00.58]I'm not going to improve in analytics.
[77:02.40]It's not going to happen.
[77:10.63]That sounds so weird coming through here.
[77:14.15]Alright.
[77:16.29]We're about to take our break.
[77:19.35]In just a moment.
[77:20.57]In just a moment.
[77:26.59]That's fun.
[77:30.41]I can't get the weight thing down.
[77:31.83]L ratio brain.
[77:39.21]Whatever.
[77:42.39]I have such trouble with this.
[77:43.77]I always have.
[77:45.87]You want to talk about, okay, wow, dude, your spatial awareness.
[77:49.22]This is exactly what you should be talking about.
[77:52.84]I have trouble with, like, orientation of stuff.
[78:15.03]Okay.
[78:16.29]I'm being analytical about this.
[78:17.57]I'm not going fast.
[78:20.09]Oops.
[78:27.04]Okay.
[78:33.40]Okay.
[78:34.12]That's better than last time.
[78:40.43]I don't know, dude.
[78:41.29]I don't fucking know.
[78:43.20]I don't know.
[78:44.16]It sounds like you're making pop- When is this bit gonna end?
[78:46.76]I'm- I can't plug this back in.
[78:49.76]Uh, this- this took like five minutes to get in the right spot behind the monitor.
[78:54.22]So, I could hear it.
[78:55.98]It's not going back in.
[78:57.25]I can't do it.
[79:04.75]Sounds like somebody's breaking tiles in another room.
[79:11.12]I'm not going to be able to get gold on any of these.
[79:15.14]Hold on.
[79:15.56]Let me try to plug it back in.
[79:16.84]It's such a weird spot.
[79:25.13]I don't think I... Do you want to help me plug it in?
[79:27.27]Alright, here.
[79:28.89]Go back and play.
[79:29.65]I just can't see.
[79:30.77]Oh, yeah!
[79:38.59]She got it first try!
[79:42.02]This is so loud.
[79:42.80]I gotta turn this down.
[79:47.60]She's, like, sneaking back here.
[79:51.61]I'll see you in a bit.
[79:54.11]She's, like, sneaking around.
[79:55.49]I'll be really honest.
[79:59.53]I gotta be really honest.
[80:00.49]Holy shit.
[80:03.59]I don't even know how she just did that.
[80:07.29]I don't think you guys understand.
[80:08.27]There's, like...
[80:10.13]There's like six inches of space behind the desk.
[80:14.51]And she just was like, boom, bam, in, gone.
[80:17.72]That was un-fucking-believable.
[80:20.52]It took me like, it took me 15 minutes to get this plugged in.
[80:27.38]She's just fucking there.
[80:30.26]Isn't she great?
[80:33.52]That was cute.
[80:34.14]I love that.
[80:34.52]Alright.
[80:37.83]Just without even being seen either, she's just like gone.
[80:42.23]Sneak queen.
[80:43.01]Alright.
[80:46.89]Two, four, six, seven.
[80:48.65]I'm going to throw it into the ground.
[81:06.68]Oh, she knows how to analyze shit.
[81:12.11]I just can't I'm sitting there like I'm sitting there with a plug just going like I don't understand how this goes in there I just I can't analyze how it plugs in I see it's small enough to fit in that hole but where is that hole he comes in here with an axe I'm dodging it alright start over again
[81:41.32]Game's muted?
[81:42.01]Oh.
[82:43.19]It has to be worth a gold medal.
[82:46.95]That's a gold medal.
[82:47.99]It has to be, right?
[82:49.01]Yes!
[82:49.53]Much better?
[82:50.21]Yeah.
[82:50.59]Okay, how about...
[83:13.48]Identify.
[83:14.44]I'll get... Okay.
[83:16.66]All gold medals give you something, right?
[83:45.01]Fuck you.
[83:46.81]What?
[84:26.27]That's gotta be gold, right?
[84:27.11]That has to be a gold medal.
[84:31.09]That's better than what I had before.
[84:32.21]Come on.
[84:32.59]Gold!
[84:35.31]Got it.
[84:43.27]Are you doing the stream?
[84:43.91]Yeah, I'll be at the stream rewards.
[84:46.46]Because I'm planning on it.
[84:49.06]Alright, compute.
[84:49.84]This one's just add up the numbers and that's it.
[84:53.80]Don't do anything else.
[85:55.93]I fucking can't do this one.
[85:57.93]I can't.
[85:59.23]No!
[85:59.81]I need gold.
[86:02.41]Do it again.
[86:03.43]Come on.
[86:04.21]I need 300.
[87:23.82]Bingo.
[87:25.64]That's gonna be huge.
[87:33.22]That's a triple gold medal.
[87:37.01]Perfect.
[87:42.73]Alright, come on.
[87:44.33]This one's weird with the analog.
[87:45.57]This would be way easier with a finger or a stylus.
[87:47.97]Time to 12.
[87:54.84]It's weird.
[88:02.99]180 minutes.
[88:03.29]6, 12.
[88:03.91]So it's backwards.
[88:12.13]80 minutes.
[88:12.75]6.
[88:13.11]Okay.
[88:14.27]Backwards.
[88:20.76]Forward, 6, 12, 18, so that's 3 hours ahead.
[88:22.40]1, 2, 3, plus 5.
[88:22.62]6, 12.
[88:22.70]So, 1, 2, 35 minutes.
[88:23.14]5, 10, 15, 20, 20, 30, here.
[88:23.40]Fall back, 6, 12.
[88:25.34]1, 2, right there.
[88:27.28]DO IT!
[88:52.51]I don't think that's gold.
[88:57.65]I don't think it's gold.
[89:01.71]I need to be, I need to do a little bit better than that.
[89:03.35]Come on, man.
[89:33.31]No controller!
[89:42.11]I fucking hate this thing.
[89:43.51]It's such a shit.
[90:16.81]There's a weird reverb on the mic?
[90:33.97]It's probably the fan.
[90:34.73]The fan's blowing into the mic.
[90:36.51]Is that the fan on?
[90:37.07]Alright, that's all golds.
[90:47.16]I could definitely get gold on this one.
[90:48.28]I only did it once.
[92:06.93]Alright, only two more.
[92:18.70]And I'm good.
[92:21.38]Okay, I gotta focus on this one.
[92:23.04]Don't be an idiot.
[92:45.59]Do it again.
[92:45.96]I'm never going to get it.
[93:43.64]Huh?
[93:54.41]Dude, I don't think I'll ever get that one past Silver.
[94:03.63]I need 400.
[94:04.72]I gotta do... I almost had it.
[94:07.37]I just gotta get it quick.
[94:09.05]Quick.
[94:48.92]SHIT!
[94:53.39]No, you're kidding me!
[94:54.17]You gotta be fucking kidding me!
[95:11.14]What the fuck, dude?
[95:12.94]How are you supposed to do that?
[95:14.95]How is it... How is that possible for you to get that in?
[95:17.15]I don't get it.
[95:17.87]400?
[95:18.71]I'll wait on the 4.
[95:27.12]This shit is just so... I can't do it.
[95:28.82]My brain just can't process it.
[95:30.16]I don't think I'm ever gonna get 400.
[95:41.19]Dude, I'm... It's like the... It's the segmentation that my brain just goes, you can't fucking do it.
[95:58.50]It's the segmented pieces down here that it's like, look, it's done up there, mom.
[96:02.36]It's like, no, I can't.
[96:03.96]My brain just can't do it.
[96:26.20]Um.
[96:29.12]Oh.
[96:30.14]Okay.
[96:35.34]Bro.
[96:35.96]I don't.
[96:36.58]I can't.
[96:37.34]I can't, dude.
[96:41.31]I can't.
[96:54.56]This is the one thing that I will never be able to do.
[96:58.06]Ever.
[97:02.40]The segmented pieces become one piece in my brain.
[97:05.46]And it's physically not possible for me to do it.
[97:11.34]Come on, dude.
[97:12.98]Try playing it drunk.
[97:14.58]That would actually probably help.
[97:24.56]They're all one piece.
[97:28.34]They're all one piece.
[97:29.56]My brain is mushing them all together.
[97:34.24]It's like I think they're all connected because they're all connected.
[97:36.98]Okay.
[97:37.62]You know what I wish they would do?
[97:39.63]I don't want to see the top one.
[97:41.25]The top one is fucking with my head.
[97:43.05]It's making them connected down here too.
[97:46.35]I'm going to literally block the top of the screen off.
[98:23.11]Fuck, it's happening again.
[98:55.58]Fuck!
[98:56.30]Did I get 400?
[98:59.54]Yay!
[99:01.62]Let go.
[99:03.78]Let go of me.
[99:07.19]Let go.
[99:07.93]Let go of me.
[99:08.47]Let go of me.
[99:09.21]Let go of me.
[99:30.44]Fuck.
[100:22.57]I got how far did I get?
[100:23.97]Oh my god, I thought I was really low on that scale.
[100:31.30]Minus 300.
[100:34.04]I got it!
[100:34.40]Okay, I got gold on everything.
[100:44.19]Super practice.
[100:45.37]In this harder practice, every activity starts in the advanced class.
[100:52.62]That's not happening.
[101:59.72]Jesus.
[101:59.90]Got it.
[102:29.77]Bet you can't do that.
[102:35.38]Sorry, I'm fucking out of here.
[102:38.96]I will see you guys in exactly... Exactly.
[102:49.78]Like 20 minutes.
[102:50.38]We're going to take a long break.
[102:52.32]I'm going to come back with Elden Ring.
[102:53.42]That was fun.
[102:58.47]This is the end of the first segment of this stream.
[103:01.25]I'm going to eat.
[103:03.27]I'm going to pee again.
[103:04.35]I'm going to refill my drink.
[103:06.33]Get a water.
[103:06.71]And I'll be back for Elden Ring.
[103:12.27]I'm going to play Elden Ring until I'm done.
[103:13.96]See you in about 20 minutes.
[103:17.18]I'm going to put text on the screen too just because I want to make sure people know that I'm not coming right back.
[103:28.04]Let's solve that now.
[103:33.86]That to where it needs to be.
[103:34.92]Okay, I'm going to add some text on the screen.
[103:38.83]This is an intermission.
[103:41.49]There you go.
[104:01.32]I'll see you guys in about 15-20 minutes.
[104:07.75]It might even be shorter than that.
[104:13.57]Include where you left.
[104:15.97]Oh, that's a good part.
[104:16.57]That's a good idea.
[104:18.71]I don't know.
[104:19.15]I'll write this.
[104:19.57]15-20 minute break.
[104:21.23]I'll say back at 6.40 Pacific.
[104:31.36]There you go.
[104:32.94]That makes more sense.
[104:39.43]Let's see how this plays out.
[104:46.13]So, I'll be right back.
[104:47.49]I'm not going to have any music because I don't think it'll... It'll just be looping for like 20 minutes.
[104:52.86]Let's make this really easy to see.
[104:59.90]Alright, I'll be right back.
[105:01.57]I'll see you guys at 640-ish.
[105:02.39]Let's see how this plays out.
[105:05.23]I'm really curious how this works.
[105:07.71]No music?
[105:08.25]Do random music?
[105:11.18]Um... I feel like it's going to loop the same thing.
[105:14.58]Nah, this is alright.
[105:15.74]Alright, I'll be right back.
[105:17.61]20 minutes.
[105:18.23]Tops.
[105:18.99]Probably less.
