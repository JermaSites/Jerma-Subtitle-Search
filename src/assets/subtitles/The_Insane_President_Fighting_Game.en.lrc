[00:09.30]Who is the best president?
[00:12.41]Which president will reign supreme?
[00:15.25]We will surely find out in the Battle of the Presidents.
[00:20.83]We got George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, George Bush, Barack- Barack Obama's like a wizard?
[00:30.49]Oh, we actually have a guy named The Wizard.
[00:34.00]Who is this?
[00:36.57]Is this the guy from Skyrim?
[00:39.45]And what's with the wizard?
[00:40.55]Why is, like, Ian McKellen in this game as, like, Magneto?
[00:45.03]Doom was me, and you shall lose.
[00:48.35]What?
[00:50.75]I'll knock the teeth right out of your bone box.
[00:54.12]What?
[00:55.46]What?
[00:55.78]Who did the voices for this?
[00:58.10]Battle!
[00:59.24]Battle!
[01:00.14]Presidents of the United States!
[01:04.56]Dude, if I, like, how do you do, like, moves?
[01:08.75]And what is, like, this soundtrack?
[01:15.16]This is... Dude, I, like, want to be the best in the world at this game.
[01:21.74]Let's see, let's do, like, some real moves.
[01:23.92]There we go.
[01:24.38]That was, like, a nice, like, Andrew Jackson slash.
[01:33.41]I wish I had, like, an explanation.
[01:36.47]I'm kind of at a loss for words right now, guys.
[01:38.69]Because, like, seriously?
[01:41.24]This is, like, the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
[01:49.34]That, with the music involved as well.
[01:52.14]Did I win?
[01:52.59]I don't know.
[01:56.33]I have no idea.
[01:56.99]I'm gonna go with, like, the punching strategy.
[01:59.37]That seems to work the best.
[02:07.94]I got a big stick with your name on it.
[02:12.64]Oh, that's great.
[02:14.94]I got a big stick.
[02:16.28]I got a big stick with your name on it.
[02:19.54]Do it again.
[02:19.96]How did I do that?
[02:23.25]Forward, back forward, right?
[02:24.83]I got a big stick with your name on it.
[02:26.99]Why is he not doing any moves to me?
[02:29.55]That's the first thing he's done.
[02:30.53]This is Abraham Lincoln, I think, right?
[02:35.09]I got a big stick.
[02:35.93]Dude, I got a big stick again.
[02:36.97]That was great.
[02:39.10]I got a big stick with your name on it.
[02:41.78]What kind of character is this?
[02:43.70]The wizard?
[02:44.24]Oh, damn!
[02:47.87]Come on, you wanna fuck with a wizard?
[02:51.57]Holy shit, dude, the wizard's the best character in the game!
[02:54.03]Are you serious right now?
[02:57.65]How do I do, like, his moves?
[02:59.07]I know one was back forward, right?
[03:01.36]Oh, sick!
[03:04.48]Fireballs, too, man.
[03:05.60]Like, this guy's got it all.
[03:10.42]Seriously, I'll never lose.
[03:14.28]You wanna see how you win every single match in this game?
[03:17.18]Just do campaign, pick the wizard, and just tap X. Literally nobody can do anything.
[03:23.76]He can't do anything right now.
[03:26.32]He's screwed!
[03:27.73]I won!
[03:28.05]Flawless victory!
[03:30.21]The wizard's... What the fuck is this game, dude?
[03:41.97]What?
[03:43.31]What is... What the fuck is going on, dude?
[03:51.84]Why is he like a lizard?
[03:56.24]Why does Ronald Reagan look like he's from Jurassic Park?
[04:00.36]He just looks like he's one of like the hunters from Jurassic Park.
[04:04.68]What has he got for moves?
[04:06.12]I think I can like... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?
[04:08.19]Quit moving so fast!
[04:09.79]I think I can, like, shoot my gun, can't I?
[04:13.13]Oh, yeah!
[04:13.73]I didn't even do anything!
[04:15.57]Dude, I, like, shot, like, my revolver at this guy, and it didn't even, like, hurt him.
[04:21.85]Let's go, Blinkin'.
[04:23.68]You think you can mess around with me, Blinkin'?
[04:26.10]Hey, Blinkin'!
[04:28.04]Sorry.
[04:29.36]Sorry, it's impossible to lose in this game, Blinkin'.
[04:31.70]You're not gonna beat me.
[04:33.50]I'll let you hit me, like, 17 times.
[04:37.24]Or your AI might just... You know, your AI... No, we're just gonna end it.
[04:41.06]What, you wanna mess with James Polk?
[04:43.20]Is that what you wanna do?
[04:43.86]You wanna mess with James Polk, the spooky scary ghost guy?
[04:51.30]We're on the moon, I forgot.
[04:52.29]Look at this gravity.
[04:52.99]Look at this moon gravity.
[04:54.13]I feel like I'm in the Matrix.
[04:59.63]Don't hit me.
[05:01.11]Don't hit me.
[05:04.25]Why did they make him, like, Shang Tsung?
[05:09.61]Look, I know you really think you're gonna win this, but if you think you're going to be able to compete against, like, the weird Harry Potter dragon thing, then you're crazy, motherfucker, let's go!
[05:20.30]Come on, come on, come on!
[05:24.00]Fuck me, fuck the dragon!
[05:25.80]Goddamn, fuck a dragon!
[05:29.17]Aw... It wore off!
[05:31.58]I can only win as the dragon!
[05:33.04]Or I'll just... Dude, this is like... This is one of the wackiest games I've ever played.
[05:41.04]It's just total... This is absurd.
[05:42.35]This is TOTALLY absurd.
[05:44.87]Ugh... Hey!
[05:48.63]President Battle, whatever the fuck this game's name is.
