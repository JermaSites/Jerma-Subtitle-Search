[00:25.19]Yeah.
[00:27.27]Just making sure you guys can hear me.
[00:28.19]I'm out on the open road here.
[00:31.09]In my truck that I got a pretty good deal on.
[00:36.63]I love the sound of that engine.
[00:38.60]God, I love the way that sounds.
[00:41.52]Yeah, so, um, passing by the Montana Valley right now.
[00:45.86]I'm going to be playing some Sleeping Dogs.
[00:49.63]And car turned off now.
[00:50.73]Let me just pull over on the side of the road here.
[00:53.53]I'll put it by the laptop.
[00:55.89]There we go.
[00:57.93]And my laptop has... We've got sleeping dogs on this laptop.
[01:03.25]Perfect.
[01:04.83]It's a good laptop.
[01:05.57]I can stream from it.
[01:08.27]Just to get out somewhere in the middle of nowhere because, I mean, you know, my internet sucks.
[01:12.03]Fucking internet sucks.
[01:17.87]Hi, guys.
[01:18.73]Didn't even make Vuck tweet.
[01:22.87]By the way...
[01:25.50]I'm not feeling so great today.
[01:28.72]My head, I got a pretty bad fucking migraine.
[01:33.03]I want to go out and get out of my truck and get some fresh air, you know.
[01:36.01]But I'm going to go as long as I can today.
[01:38.65]I can't promise there's going to be another like six or seven hour stream like yesterday.
[01:43.09]But if we go short today, then tomorrow I will do a long ass stream.
[01:51.67]You know what I mean?
[01:52.49]To make up for it.
[01:57.27]Stop inhaling fumes.
[01:58.71]What do you think my truck is down here for?
[02:00.26]Hold on, let me start it back up again.
[02:05.62]I got an air filter down here to try to get rid of the fucking dead rat fumes.
[02:11.62]Anywho, give me one minute and we'll get started.
[02:14.12]Hold on.
[02:54.98]Alright.
[02:55.90]This should be fine.
[02:58.86]Pick off pretty much what we left off.
[03:00.10]Gonna play Sleeping Dogs again.
[03:01.22]Because that's kind of what we're doing now.
[03:07.78]I'm doing well.
[03:08.34]I hope you guys are doing okay.
[03:09.62]A little bit on the ill side, but that's fine.
[03:15.61]I've got a new emote that's going to be replaced.
[03:19.11]So don't get too comfy with this emote, because it's going to be replaced.
[03:25.92]I want to like, I want to do it better.
[03:27.46]I don't like the way it looks right now.
[03:33.14]Jerma's Snort is available for the low, low price of $4.99 at the box.
[03:41.15]No, it's got to be lightened.
[03:44.57]Truth be told, I did it.
[03:45.75]Looks like an angry wasp.
[03:49.75]Wait, let me do the surveillance thing just because I'm here.
[03:54.52]Make it Neptune as blue.
[03:56.80]Well, then it'd have to be... Do you really want me to have two emotes here that are the same, like Mars and Fear?
[04:08.27]That's the same emote.
[04:12.36]Let's take a look here.
[04:12.98]We've got a collection.
[04:13.68]Let's go to Lume Alley.
[04:15.42]This is a new one with some activity.
[04:19.84]Identify the supplier and have him arrested.
[04:23.47]Well, it's definitely this guy at the truck.
[04:26.55]The question is, who's the supplier?
[04:33.19]It's this guy in the suit.
[04:34.99]Right?
[04:35.39]No?
[04:35.61]Maybe not.
[04:36.57]This guy clapping.
[04:38.73]He's happy that he's a satisfied customer.
[04:42.27]I don't think this is the supplier.
[04:43.73]I think this is the supplier.
[04:48.20]Maybe not.
[04:51.04]We just watched this guy snort coke on camera, so let's arrest him.
[05:02.83]Why do they only arrest one guy?
[05:04.33]Hey, I got it.
[05:09.73]I'm going to do all these right now.
[05:13.64]I unlocked two or three of them.
[05:15.26]Just do them.
[05:18.52]Cop points and money.
[05:21.84]We did this one.
[05:22.54]We got this one here.
[05:23.82]The quartz.
[05:28.75]Cut that emote's hair?
[05:29.95]No.
[05:31.47]Okay, identify the drug user.
[05:37.49]Oh, this is this guy right here.
[05:39.90]Maybe not.
[05:40.28]Hold on.
[05:46.46]Imagine this is what you did when you hung out with your friends.
[05:49.68]Three of you swung knives around.
[05:52.73]Two of you were drinking and smoking over here.
[05:54.57]And one of you was on acid.
[05:59.62]And the other one's just eating his dinner.
[06:01.06]Like, this is not... I wouldn't want to... I would not want to be here.
[06:06.20]Yeah, guys, let's go hang out at the basketball court and swing fucking cleavers around.
[06:11.46]That's how you get arrested, guys.
[06:16.58]That looks like spy party.
[06:17.98]Alright.
[06:22.25]Remember I told you the only way I was going to get cop points was by doing the minigames?
[06:25.73]Well, here we are.
[06:28.13]You know what I'm saying?
[06:28.87]Here we are.
[06:31.31]Let's do one of the upgrades.
[06:33.65]Okay.
[06:37.66]I don't like these.
[06:38.56]Increase ramp.
[06:39.14]You know what?
[06:39.42]We're going to try to get the ramp.
[06:40.60]I'm so bad at this.
[06:42.48]I have so many problems with this.
[06:45.90]This doesn't matter.
[06:47.30]Guns aren't even really that much of a big deal in the game anyways.
[06:50.34]Recoil doesn't matter.
[06:51.04]None of the gun shit even matters.
[06:54.51]Action, hijack, reduce heat.
[06:58.33]Yeah.
[07:00.05]I'm going to try to get the extra damage for ramming.
[07:02.17]That seems way more important than slow motion slides.
[07:08.18]Alright, let's go.
[07:08.68]I think that's it.
[07:09.36]I don't think I have any more in here.
[07:11.98]Fairly certain I don't.
[07:15.30]I've already slept.
[07:15.94]What have we got?
[07:18.04]Hotshot Lead 2.
[07:19.70]Lead 2.
[07:20.20]Go to the construction site.
[07:23.08]Or... Payback.
[07:30.16]Hey, the ladies are still hanging out here.
[07:32.87]Take off the costume.
[07:33.75]Well, I can't take this costume off because now my title is ingrained into the costume.
[07:38.91]I'm the Bicentennial Man.
[07:40.19]And if I do that, the title has to change.
[07:42.27]And I can't think of a good title.
[07:47.12]Where's my motorcycle?
[07:52.35]It's not the silver server.
[07:53.35]He's not silver.
[07:56.67]This is a nice car.
[07:57.87]I got it now.
[07:59.27]I'm not taking it off.
[08:04.13]I'm not gonna take it off.
[08:05.97]The whole title joke is I have to wear this for at least like 30 to 40 minutes.
[08:12.05]This is right here.
[08:18.19]God damn it.
[08:19.41]I thought it was the left side.
[08:21.71]Forget it.
[08:22.37]The game just fucking crashed.
[08:24.51]What the hell?
[08:33.25]I was trying to dive into the marker, but I keep forgetting I'm on the right side.
[08:37.95]Let's reopen it.
[08:41.31]Please don't tell me I have to do all that shit again.
[08:42.87]I'm probably gonna have to do the...
[08:48.15]No, it should have saved it, right?
[08:49.95]I hope so.
[08:58.42]Ow.
[09:00.80]Yes, that is what we're playing.
[09:03.70]Continue.
[09:08.08]And?
[09:10.26]Did it... I think it's okay.
[09:15.09]Let's see, what level am I...
[09:19.08]Dammit.
[09:19.50]No, we're good.
[09:20.10]We're good.
[09:21.80]Okay.
[09:22.36]So, it did save.
[09:24.38]Thank god.
[09:29.49]Okay.
[09:29.77]Alright, rewind.
[09:34.93]Rewind, yeah.
[09:35.75]That's what the snort is for!
[09:37.78]Every time there's a crash, every time there's a problem, let me see those snorts.
[09:40.88]Because that means we gotta go back.
[09:42.42]You know what I'm saying?
[09:44.30]Let me see those snorts in the chat.
[09:46.46]Just wait till that emote is deleted in three days.
[09:49.79]No, I'm kidding.
[09:54.19]You guys want Beanbag Sonic to... Well, when the emote contest happens, you are very, very much entitled to vote and show whatever you'd like.
[10:07.66]I'm getting another batch of emotes.
[10:09.86]After this batch of emotes, there will be the contest.
[10:16.77]Yeah, emote contest.
[10:18.03]Is the emote contest going to be settled with a royal rumble?
[10:21.43]Well, no, because that means only one emote could win.
[10:41.90]No, it doesn't work like that.
[10:43.04]How long is the contest going to last?
[10:44.26]Probably a couple weeks.
[10:45.38]Once we... Because, look, I don't...
[11:00.89]There are like five more emotes coming in the next couple weeks, right?
[11:04.33]Then that's it.
[11:05.95]And then it's up to you guys.
[11:07.05]And here's the new Hearthstone expansion.
[11:08.57]Okay.
[11:08.71]Okay, okay, do it.
[11:09.73]Bring him alive.
[11:10.29]Right, boss.
[11:29.99]Get in the convoy.
[11:32.53]Which one does it want me in?
[11:34.08]God damn it.
[11:36.48]There's a lot of people in here.
[11:38.80]Follow the Water Street Boys.
[11:45.75]Well, he almost hit him.
[11:46.71]It's not my fault.
[11:48.99]That's a terrible name for a gang.
[11:50.47]You gotta have a better name.
[11:52.75]Water Street Boys.
[11:53.21]That sounds very generic.
[11:54.25]I'd rather have, you know, call myself, like, the WB.
[11:55.92]What do you mean?
[11:56.48]Water Street Boys need to have the Warner Bros.
[11:59.00]logo.
[11:59.32]With, like, Bugs Bunny painted on their car.
[12:01.02]That's right, the WB gang.
[12:01.68]That wasn't a joke.
[12:02.22]Don't get mad at me for that.
[12:03.28]That was mean.
[12:04.02]I wasn't even, I was not making a joke.
[12:22.13]Do I play Hearthstone?
[12:23.31]Uh, like four years ago.
[12:24.25]I feel like this is the first episode of... Wait, why am I getting out?
[12:32.44]Oh.
[12:32.50]Let's scout the plant.
[12:48.17]Okay, scout it out.
[12:49.37]Well, I don't need to scout anything.
[12:50.52]Well, actually, I am going to scout, because there's probably cases.
[12:55.36]Just look at the shiny, glowing object.
[13:03.82]No, I would think it wouldn't be this far away, you know?
[13:10.02]Don't leave.
[13:10.64]I'm not leaving.
[13:11.24]I'm just looking around.
[13:12.08]You hide stuff in this game, man.
[13:17.60]I don't usually snort.
[13:22.94]Danger, keep up.
[13:23.80]Alright, so we're gonna... Oh shit.
[13:27.81]Okay.
[13:30.89]Alright, we'll be going after the janitors first.
[13:33.29]I'm going to take out both janitors.
[13:35.93]Grab the bottle of surge out of that guy's hand.
[13:41.11]Smash the guy on the right.
[13:42.81]Dropkick the guy on the left.
[13:44.57]Throw the broom into the guy that's hiding behind the corner here.
[13:48.47]And then we take the two Bicentennial men out.
[13:51.33]Because this is a rescue mission, as you can see.
[13:58.86]That didn't really work.
[14:02.80]Over here, head to the fans.
[14:04.98]Come here!
[14:08.21]Oh, that was awesome.
[14:09.05]Let's do that again.
[14:13.81]I feel like that would hurt less than if I were to do that to you on the ground here.
[14:18.05]I gave you extra padding.
[14:25.47]Oh, I'm sorry!
[14:26.06]Did you think you could fuck with a Bicentennial man?! !
[14:34.66]This game is so much fun.
[14:43.84]The audience right there just collectively went like... I don't think so.
[15:06.62]Let's give this guy a combo here.
[15:08.62]What do you say?
[15:09.22]Get up.
[15:11.96]Oh, fuck off.
[15:12.52]No, he's just picking him up!
[15:19.72]God damn it!
[15:23.38]Whatever.
[15:24.36]Just break his neck.
[15:25.60]I just did the Attack on Titan to this guy.
[15:28.55]Alright, he's dead.
[15:29.59]Okay.
[15:31.49]I got him right in the nape of his neck.
[15:34.45]Just like that anime that I saw a year ago.
[15:39.35]Can't grab big guy.
[15:40.19]I wasn't trying to grab.
[15:40.79]I was trying to pick him up.
[15:44.81]Which, you know, is the same thing as grabbing.
[15:53.60]Evolve, disarm.
[15:56.50]Oh, wait.
[15:56.74]I can disarm them if I jump through into them.
[16:00.46]Oh!
[16:00.80]Oh, that guy.
[16:01.34]They're talking about this guy.
[16:04.92]That's what they're talking about.
[16:08.01]And, by the way...
[16:09.37]Yo!
[16:10.53]Oh, audience again.
[16:11.41]Oh!
[16:17.82]Audience is really, really starting to get kind of scared.
[16:26.32]Shit!
[16:27.74]Shit!
[16:30.85]I don't like fighting on the stairs here.
[16:33.43]It's too awkward of an angle.
[16:45.17]One at a time now.
[16:46.17]One at a time now, guys.
[16:47.33]How did I not block you?
[16:56.68]Get the knife out of his hand.
[17:00.54]There it is.
[17:00.96]Give me the knife.
[17:03.94]No, give me the knife.
[17:05.46]I can't.
[17:06.22]I guess I can only have the gun or the knife.
[17:08.66]I definitely don't want to let go of the gun.
[17:21.70]No, okay, I guess not.
[17:25.98]Swap for kitchen knife.
[17:28.00]I get it, okay.
[17:29.50]I have to have the gun down.
[17:33.26]Why am I Iron Man?
[17:34.34]I'm not Iron Man.
[17:35.32]Excuse me, did you see the title?
[17:36.72]I'm the Bicentennial Man.
[17:39.36]Very different.
[17:59.54]Nice yoga position.
[18:01.70]I call that one the baby getting diaper changed.
[18:06.48]It really stretches your hamstrings and gives you good back support.
[18:14.90]He thought about that before he died.
[18:35.42]I can I got a lot of weight explosion.
[18:42.19]Oh Oh That doesn't look good he got caught his shoe got caught in the escalator Machine gun since when is this machine gun give me the ammo.
[18:55.77]Oh
[19:04.93]It's not that.
[19:08.71]What's the reload button?
[19:13.47]Anything else, like grenades or anything I can do?
[19:14.91]I don't want to be an idiot here.
[19:18.02]Look around for, like, chests.
[19:24.32]I missed the opportunity to make a title joke?
[19:28.18]Did I, though?
[19:28.68]I don't want to be that easy.
[19:39.82]Nah, I got full, I got full bullets.
[19:45.41]Defeat the enemy guards, and away we go.
[19:49.45]Watch out for this guy.
[19:52.39]One, two, three.
[19:53.69]Ooh, no, I'll get it.
[19:59.04]Got it.
[19:59.30]Now I do.
[20:03.58]Ooh, hold on.
[20:06.66]That only got one guy.
[20:16.46]Draw your head.
[20:20.30]Come on!
[20:20.74]Look at this!
[20:21.56]Ah!
[20:22.14]Got it.
[20:23.37]No!
[20:24.35]I'm fine.
[20:29.59]No!
[20:31.45]Quarter of a second.
[20:40.50]I love the way he holds the gun.
[20:56.60]Everything's fine.
[20:57.16]I was just trying to see how many times I could shoot that guy.
[21:09.19]Does that guy have an eSports team on his shirt?
[21:18.54]What's the name of that eSports team that looks like that?
[21:22.86]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[21:24.50]Oh, this is a good guy.
[21:25.62]Okay.
[21:28.14]What's he doing?
[21:28.90]Why are you here?
[21:30.32]Why are you here?
[21:37.46]Turn around!
[21:38.82]And justice is served!
[22:02.59]Alright, well.
[22:08.97]I can't just do that, apparently.
[22:11.09]Oh, whoops!
[22:11.97]I can cut him off right here.
[22:16.04]Alright, come here!
[22:23.60]I'm gonna dra- wait, we both have to get out of here!
[22:26.15]Come with me!
[22:27.99]Quick!
[22:29.45]I'll get you to safety!
[22:31.85]Where's the exit?
[22:34.26]Where's the exit?
[22:34.70]It's over here somewhere.
[22:35.48]Don't you own this place?
[22:38.52]Where's the exit?
[22:41.02]You got to snap out of it.
[22:42.90]We're both going to die.
[22:44.42]Over here.
[22:47.94]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[22:51.90]Oh, shit.
[22:52.74]Down here.
[22:53.86]Stairs?
[22:55.46]Where are the other stairs?
[23:04.29]I think we have to go down that way.
[23:06.11]I don't think we can go through the fire.
[23:07.67]Okay, ready?
[23:11.47]Alright, man.
[23:11.81]We have to go this way because we have to go up and around to the left.
[23:13.91]Alright, man.
[23:14.35]You ready?
[23:16.33]One, two, three.
[23:17.47]Just go quick.
[23:19.24]Alright, we're good.
[23:23.60]That way.
[23:26.00]Around.
[23:27.46]I'm confused.
[23:33.71]No, we have to go... How the fuck did we get down there?
[23:36.31]There's no way to get down there.
[23:45.21]Um... Was there another staircase?
[23:53.39]Because you run across this way.
[23:55.47]Alright, man.
[23:55.83]Wait, wait, wait.
[23:56.33]Hold on.
[23:56.63]Slow down, slow down.
[23:57.27]Ready?
[23:58.05]Hold your breath.
[23:58.49]Ready?
[24:05.13]down here.
[24:10.70]Come on, I gotta bring you to safety.
[24:13.34]There it is!
[24:15.56]Okay, here we go.
[24:22.71]Fuck, no!
[24:23.45]God damn it, come on.
[24:40.32]Get over here.
[24:42.06]I'm not going to fucking waste any time.
[24:43.16]Time to go.
[24:45.56]Come on!
[24:49.90]Like, why do we have to do this together?
[24:51.26]I don't understand.
[24:55.06]Oh, dear.
[24:56.90]Hey, watch your back.
[25:00.78]I know you're a big fan of Team Liquid.
[25:03.28]Or whatever.
[25:04.50]Look at it right there.
[25:05.18]See?
[25:12.04]Down here.
[25:14.82]Why?
[25:15.02]Okay, why?
[25:15.44]What's going on here?
[25:17.86]I don't know.
[25:19.42]Wait, hold on.
[25:20.32]Oh, these.
[25:20.70]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:21.58]You're not going to shoot that gun.
[25:32.09]I actually did it.
[25:33.77]Oh, wow.
[25:34.17]That was what I was supposed to do.
[25:42.23]Where'd he go?
[25:43.59]Catch him?
[25:44.21]I had him in my hands already!
[25:54.69]What the fuck?!
[25:58.63]Those things are distracting.
[25:59.41]Get the lights off.
[26:08.05]No, I don't want to do it to that car!
[26:09.91]Stop!
[26:17.60]Alright, I need to transfer to this one.
[26:19.77]Then go from this one to that one.
[26:26.38]Oh shit!
[26:47.83]Oh.
[26:50.05]He's so far away.
[27:05.14]What's that slingshot game for the PlayStation?
[27:08.36]Pain?
[27:08.70]I thought this was a slingshot into that video game.
[27:12.90]Alright, let's do this again.
[27:15.28]What?
[27:15.59]There's no... I've never... We've been playing this game for like seven hours, and I've never flown out of a windshield.
[27:21.85]Floon?
[27:23.37]Floon.
[27:23.89]Flown.
[27:24.85]Flown.
[27:25.45]I've never flowned out of a windshield.
[27:30.84]Alright.
[27:31.86]Come here.
[27:34.92]Are you fucking done?
[27:35.76]Alright, I got him.
[27:36.24]Okay, okay, I'm done.
[27:39.07]So, I'm the police officer now.
[27:40.39]Leave me alone.
[27:40.85]Almost there.
[27:47.79]We're out, right?
[27:48.37]Okay.
[27:50.91]What are you doing?
[27:51.92]Taking you to the bus stop.
[27:53.18]You know what you just did?
[27:54.82]You're dead.
[27:55.86]You're dead!
[27:56.96]Look, I'm not afraid of dog eyes.
[27:58.54]Dog eyes?
[27:59.86]Motherfucker, I get paid...
[28:02.43]You get paid.
[28:03.85]Alright, good.
[28:04.91]Oh, I didn't ghost ride.
[28:08.47]I was holding down A.
[28:33.31]Yeah, it's NRG.
[28:33.86]It's the esports team I'm thinking of.
[28:36.70]Here.
[29:07.60]This is the shirt he was wearing.
[29:12.83]He was a big NRG fan.
[29:19.14]Get that off the screen so people don't think I... Hold on.
[29:21.00]I shouldn't have done that.
[29:28.12]Like, putting on, like, fucking sponsored team logos.
[29:33.71]What do you mean not even close?
[29:35.27]What are you talking about?
[29:36.85]That was almost exactly what he had on for a shirt.
[29:40.38]Okay.
[29:43.16]This is kind of... Come on.
[29:49.66]I'll tap back into this.
[29:51.04]Give me back my window.
[29:53.80]Give me back my window.
[29:59.48]Give me my full window.
[30:03.51]Oh, you dick.
[30:04.25]I just had it, too.
[30:05.35]Shit.
[30:10.23]Man, almost.
[30:13.04]My mouse cursor is invisible, by the way, so if you're curious as to what the fuck I'm talking about... There it is.
[30:17.50]This is gonna drive me crazy.
[30:27.64]Hold on, I need to, like, go into options and display.
[30:32.95]Full screen.
[30:34.29]On.
[30:36.01]Thank you.
[30:36.51]Jesus.
[30:37.31]Pain in the ass.
[30:37.91]Alright.
[30:41.99]Anyways, let's keep going.
[30:47.24]So now we got a... We can do a race.
[30:49.38]There's a race right here.
[30:51.52]Let's just check it out.
[30:52.90]Alright.
[30:53.30]Might as well see.
[30:53.84]Might as well see.
[31:02.13]Have I sorted out my hair?
[31:06.53]I mean, my hair's fine.
[31:08.82]I got my hair cut.
[31:10.06]You guys already saw that.
[31:12.06]Is this a different race?
[31:12.86]Or is it the same one that I, like, almost had a panic attack over?
[31:15.60]Wait, can I steal other people's bikes?
[31:20.76]No.
[31:23.12]Holy shit, dude.
[31:24.28]Easy.
[31:24.50]No, this is a shorter race.
[31:27.24]This is good.
[31:31.06]Why would I look at chat?
[31:34.12]Stop looking at chat!
[31:35.04]I'm telling myself not to and I keep doing it anyway.
[31:37.53]Stop doing that!
[31:38.25]My brain is wired so strangely.
[31:43.43]I'm a four year old.
[31:44.73]Tell me to do something and I won't do it.
[31:46.33]Tell me not to do something and I'm gonna do it.
[31:47.91]Fucking idiot.
[32:01.77]Can't ram on a bike in this.
[32:05.02]What are you doing?
[32:06.46]I thought that... Oh no!
[32:12.76]That fucking stupid guy!
[32:14.66]Just sitting in the middle of the road.
[32:15.76]I thought he was a contestant.
[32:21.73]He fucked me up so bad.
[32:24.83]This loss is on that guy.
[32:27.45]No, haven't lost yet.
[32:28.63]Hold on.
[32:44.42]There it is.
[32:46.10]Got it.
[32:51.67]Bad driver Lou.
[32:52.79]$25,000.
[32:54.49]Nice.
[32:54.89]Okay, cool.
[32:55.47]What?
[32:55.97]Wait, what is going on?
[33:06.34]Why am I aiming the gun?
[33:16.40]Slow motion.
[33:19.78]Alright, so let's get going.
[33:23.88]How about this race?
[33:24.52]Might as well do it when we're here.
[33:29.23]Video games are weird, especially this one.
[33:41.26]You know what the real sad part is?
[33:44.26]The amount of spending that goes into this underground place.
[33:48.40]They have to pay a new one of those girls every time.
[33:50.95]They're going to get a new Flare Girl.
[33:54.71]I keep running them over.
[33:56.99]How much do they get cost for like one night of being like the Flare Girl that drop like the... And go!
[34:01.03]For like a hundred bucks.
[34:04.29]I'm costing this organization thousands of dollars a month.
[34:09.60]They need to get a new one every day.
[34:14.54]Thanks to me.
[34:15.02]I never said it wasn't my fault.
[34:20.96]Just saying.
[34:21.40]It's reality.
[34:23.82]They take it out of my winnings.
[34:24.94]No they don't.
[34:26.10]I get a clean 25k every time.
[34:30.52]By the way.
[34:32.84]Yawn.
[34:33.30]Because I'm about to win this without any contest.
[34:38.32]It's a free $20,000.
[34:39.02]That's the easy one.
[34:39.76]They gave me that.
[34:40.22]But we've been doing the hard ones first.
[34:46.18]10k.
[34:46.22]You can disarm melee opponents while grappling.
[34:52.21]Okay, that's cool.
[34:52.93]I leveled up.
[34:56.93]I don't have any new... Let's just start the new case.
[35:06.31]It's right here.
[35:12.59]Am I dead?
[35:16.29]Oh, fuck that.
[35:17.35]Never mind.
[35:18.87]Changed my mind.
[35:19.51]Going to the Fight Club?
[35:23.36]I can do that after this.
[35:26.54]This'll be fun.
[35:39.80]Let's do the next mission.
[35:42.30]I really want, like, more coffee.
[35:46.40]Oh, my head is killing me.
[35:49.16]No, Snoopy!
[35:50.02]Get in the van!
[35:51.37]Not on top the van, Snoopy!
[35:53.27]You guys don't... You never heard Snoopy talk?
[36:16.37]Are you?
[36:18.19]Hold on.
[36:18.83]Everyone's really confused.
[36:20.39]That's fine.
[36:32.99]By the way, that was Snoopy talking.
[36:36.25]That's Snoopy in the fucking Charlie Brown cartoon talking.
[36:42.65]Okay, so now that we've gone that far, we've figured that out, that that's Snoopy.
[36:56.15]That's a YouTube poop.
[36:57.21]Never mind.
[37:01.79]You guys also used the sounds of Snoopy and Woodstock that Bill Melendez taped decades ago.
[37:07.06]I think as animators, that's what we're most excited about.
[37:10.10]How they beat Pev Woodstock.
[37:11.70]He's just... Oh, you want to... Very interesting.
[37:15.18]Do something.
[37:16.02]You didn't even show it.
[37:19.10]No, whatever.
[37:19.46]You heard it the first time.
[37:23.86]Oh, here's that guy going like... Alright, let's get back to it.
[37:29.48]But yes, that is Snoopy's voice.
[37:42.79]Walk out of the trash.
[37:43.51]Walk out of the trash.
[37:44.01]Don't eat trash!
[37:58.61]Liar.
[37:59.35]I didn't even hit you.
[38:01.51]I will though.
[38:03.25]What am I doing?
[38:04.17]Closed?
[38:07.88]I can't see.
[38:08.70]That guy's just picking his nose.
[38:13.02]Don't even tell me.
[38:13.68]No.
[38:14.52]I'm fine.
[38:28.50]Okay, plant a bug under the hotshot's car.
[38:30.84]Uh-oh, I got to pay attention here.
[38:37.26]Not much.
[38:37.62]You?
[38:37.96]How's your dad?
[38:38.85]Shit, I got one minute, 22 seconds.
[38:39.63]Here we go.
[38:40.03]I've got to get this right.
[38:40.85]I told you.
[38:41.09]That's not going to take you anywhere, Nova.
[38:42.07]You coming out soon?
[39:07.57]Got it.
[39:11.25]I thought I just did... I'm sorry for the loud noise.
[39:13.93]I thought I just did something I wasn't supposed to.
[39:18.44]This thing is beat up.
[39:22.98]Suspicion.
[39:23.78]All the rules of the road remain undercover.
[39:26.84]Okay.
[39:27.64]You got it.
[39:34.25]No, that's the wrong rules.
[39:36.21]Left side.
[39:36.59]I'm just hanging out here.
[39:44.47]I'm a Seward Municipal Service.
[39:49.84]How's the race again, huh?
[39:51.10]I still own it.
[39:52.14]Hey, you know this guy, Wei Xun, supposed to be setting on you.
[40:00.78]Fucking Assassin's Creed missions.
[40:07.44]Ubisoft seriously needs to, like, seriously stop doing this.
[40:10.24]You know, like, tail the guy and listen to his conversations through your supersonic ultra hearing.
[40:16.53]Fucking Ubisoft.
[40:20.14]It's up to me to put them into place.
[40:22.08]Yeah?
[40:23.04]Why?
[40:23.48]Punk by the name of Ace.
[40:24.85]Talking a lot of trash.
[40:26.49]Now the fool actually wants to race.
[40:28.43]No accounting for people's intelligence these days.
[40:30.69]You gonna take him out?
[40:31.49]Uh-huh.
[40:32.63]Motherfucker won't know what hit him.
[40:34.33]Tell him people he's gonna take me down?
[40:36.27]What?
[40:36.45]Don't worry.
[40:37.38]Erase this meat.
[40:38.04]They'll be scraping him off the pavement in sticky little pieces.
[40:41.44]Looks like you have little choice, huh?
[40:42.82]I can hear this guy talking.
[40:47.24]Called hangar.
[40:50.24]Hey.
[40:50.54]Do you know where it went?
[40:52.40]Not yet.
[40:53.06]Hey, one other thing.
[40:54.53]I mean, I know where he is.
[40:55.57]You know him?
[40:55.99]Yeah, I know him.
[40:57.11]He's an informant for HKPD.
[40:59.23]He's the one that put us on to Hotshot in the first place.
[41:01.83]Fucking guys playing both sides of the game.
[41:13.44]Where'd they gone?
[41:14.04]What if I just arrest them and kill them now?
[41:17.14]Okay, I'm not suspicious anymore.
[41:19.36]What if I just pull up next to them?
[41:21.48]Are they gonna know who I am?
[41:46.28]Hey!
[41:47.48]Looking for me?
[41:54.71]They are on an AI path that they're not going to get off.
[41:59.61]Ram him?
[42:00.43]No, I want him to ram himself.
[42:04.10]Hold on.
[42:05.46]What the hell?
[42:06.14]I thought that was the mission moving over here.
[42:24.25]Okay, well.
[42:27.79]That was... God damn it.
[42:31.75]I did not think that was going to happen.
[42:33.57]I thought the mission was over.
[42:38.22]Way to go.
[42:40.04]I didn't want that.
[42:40.92]I wanted to see... Yeah, I'm going to skip the cutscene.
[42:45.10]Don't worry.
[42:45.62]This is exactly where we left off.
[42:46.88]It's fine.
[42:47.26]Okay.
[42:53.31]Oh, no.
[42:53.71]I'm not fucking around again.
[42:54.87]Yeah, we get to sit through that again.
[42:56.37]Sounds fun.
[42:56.87]I wasn't making a joke.
[42:58.53]How is he out of range?
[42:59.89]I can see him.
[43:00.33]I wasn't making a joke.
[43:01.91]I was trying to say... I was testing the video game's artificial intelligence.
[43:22.57]That's how we find things out about video games we play.
[43:28.01]We fuck around with them.
[43:31.29]We don't just go from A to B. We go from A to D, back to C, then back to B. Don't you understand?
[43:36.45]We're fucking scientists on this channel.
[43:38.67]We figure it out.
[43:39.81]We see what's possible.
[43:43.37]Want me to drive from A to B?
[43:45.27]And then do the mission?
[43:46.25]Or do you want me to fucking figure out the secret?
[43:50.09]Like for instance, look at this.
[43:52.03]Oh, never mind.
[43:53.45]It was a possibility to do that.
[43:59.57]Alright, that's it.
[44:01.66]Okay, I'm afraid to go near him now Alright in the clear He's an informant for HKPD.
[44:05.14]He's the one that put us on to hotshot in the first place Fucking guys playing both sides of the game
[44:24.35]I'm gonna have to race him.
[44:25.63]Yeah, I have to honk the horn to bang the phone up.
[44:28.77]It's a new service I have.
[44:30.39]It's like OnStar.
[44:31.23]I hold the horn down to open up the calls, and then I hold the horn down again to turn it on.
[44:55.46]Alright, mission complete.
[45:04.38]I forgot that's what I look like.
[45:07.01]I was supposed to be like, who the fuck is this?
[45:09.05]Because we're not the statue man in that last mission.
[45:18.16]Okay, 1200 bucks.
[45:21.62]What's next?
[45:23.70]Kind of out in the open here.
[45:26.32]Bowling opportunity again, although we already did it.
[45:28.00]We don't have to show her that we can do it again.
[45:29.48]I think we can be bi-Centennial.
[45:33.57]No, I can't.
[45:33.91]Has the stream been on for more than an hour?
[45:37.13]I don't think it has.
[45:51.70]I can't change from Bicentennial Man unless I change the title of the stream.
[45:57.10]So if we find another funny, hilarious thing to do, then by all means, I'll come for it.
[46:05.08]You know, we gotta get like some hilarious new thing.
[46:16.54]One that people will come into this stream, they'll click it and they'll be like,
[46:27.37]I want to go to the car here.
[46:28.59]I got a lot of money.
[46:29.15]It's time to spend some money.
[46:30.25]We haven't done that in a while.
[46:32.93]See if I can get a cool car.
[46:34.19]A new bike or something.
[46:39.59]Oh, what do you got?
[46:46.30]Ooh, that's cool.
[46:47.90]The little mouse car.
[46:50.52]GX300.
[46:54.15]The Kyokan.
[46:55.89]The Spark.
[46:57.95]The Prime.
[46:59.05]The Neo V. Yes.
[47:00.19]We finally have a clown car.
[47:04.83]Don't hit him.
[47:05.41]Perfect.
[47:05.59]I love it.
[47:25.34]10,000.
[47:25.70]Nice.
[47:36.41]This guy's just on like a Tower of Terror at Disney World.
[47:43.20]This ain't gonna kill him, is it?
[47:44.12]I think he's like buckled in.
[47:48.68]Oh.
[47:49.56]I think it did kill him.
[47:52.73]No, it didn't.
[47:56.10]He got a little sick, that's all.
[48:05.37]Come on, this poor guy is essentially an ant right now.
[48:08.17]I have to deal with him.
[48:16.03]Come on, get in the gerbil car.
[48:20.31]Take a look at how spacious the trunk is.
[48:24.03]It may be small.
[48:26.15]But it can handle up to 45 feet of space!
[48:28.73]Alright, what's next?
[48:43.65]That's kidnapping.
[48:46.71]Not if you let him go.
[48:47.47]But yeah, this... This isn't fishing.
[48:53.43]I just... Okay, I just attributed taking humans to going on a fishing trip.
[48:58.88]Not the same at all, actually.
[49:00.78]Absolutely not the same at all.
[49:06.90]I'm gonna let him go.
[49:07.82]See, watch.
[49:17.81]See?
[49:21.99]He's fine.
[49:23.60]He'll go, he'll eventually find his way back and do his school of fish wherever he's going.
[49:29.26]Let's go get some points.
[49:31.12]Let him go in the ocean just like fishing.
[49:33.98]Oh my god.
[49:50.50]I don't even know who's good and who's bad.
[49:52.52]Dude, where do I get one of these?
[50:02.37]He's left.
[50:02.91]Couple more.
[50:05.05]It broke on his head.
[50:09.23]Dead?
[50:11.84]Yep.
[50:13.54]Get down.
[50:15.00]Get over here.
[50:17.34]Nice work.
[50:18.06]Who's left?
[50:21.35]Couple more scumbags.
[50:28.30]Let him get up.
[50:28.94]No, actually, get him in a trash can.
[50:47.13]Wait till he does it, throw him down.
[50:51.29]Points!
[50:55.44]Illuminati Jupiter.
[51:01.40]That's a three star, baby.
[51:03.52]CSI outfit.
[51:06.30]Interesting.
[51:09.96]Yeah, we're gonna have outfits to look at soon.
[51:15.50]So we can avoid... Let me just see what's here.
[51:18.83]Let me look at the clothing shop.
[51:19.85]It's been a while.
[51:26.91]I can't do anything as Bicentennial Man, but I can just look.
[51:33.45]Okay, it's like the track top.
[51:39.42]I like that.
[51:43.44]This is like the Twitch streamer one, right?
[51:47.14]I would wear this if I was a streamer.
[51:52.58]No, fuck all these.
[51:54.34]I can't change the shoes?
[51:58.26]No.
[52:01.48]Just regular baseball caps.
[52:04.66]I mean, if I was a Twitch streamer, I'd wear these too.
[52:12.44]You know, bleed purple, man.
[52:14.74]Are you kidding?
[52:19.77]Drunken style.
[52:22.98]We could.
[52:23.38]It's possible.
[52:26.38]Let's go... I did want to get the Just Cause outfit.
[52:30.40]I don't know how... There's probably a way you unlock that, though.
[52:33.73]Something going on up here?
[52:37.49]Something going on up here.
[52:40.21]Okay.
[52:45.68]Okay.
[52:47.44]I just heard... Okay, here's the problem.
[52:49.84]This is just spy party.
[52:51.41]Who is the bad guy up there?
[52:53.23]I got one bullet to decide.
[52:54.29]I think it's the guy in the middle.
[53:01.87]I don't have a gun anymore.
[53:06.23]Fuck.
[53:11.35]I think it's probably... It's all of them.
[53:13.43]It's all of them.
[53:14.92]Or it's at least the guy on the left.
[53:17.51]And the guy on the right.
[53:19.93]No, it's all three of them.
[53:21.21]Okay, here we go.
[53:23.11]Let's... Let's take this to the bridge.
[53:24.77]I want to throw him in the water.
[53:32.41]Hold on.
[53:36.54]Into the water with him.
[53:44.12]Into the mini golf course water.
[53:50.69]I don't think so.
[53:52.73]Crippling road.
[53:56.60]That's a new thing.
[54:02.86]Anybody?
[54:03.28]Yeah, he's still alive.
[54:04.10]Okay, there we go.
[54:11.02]I guess there's a race.
[54:11.66]I'll do the race.
[54:12.43]This is the explore portion of the game.
[54:15.13]Let's go try to do them.
[54:24.29]Already abandoned my clown car.
[54:25.69]That's fine, though.
[54:33.92]Who did I run into?
[54:36.54]There was a case?
[54:38.36]Ah, a case under the bridge.
[54:39.69]I'll get it.
[54:45.35]Thank you for reminding me.
[54:46.67]Or thank you for showing me.
[54:47.53]Thank you for showing me.
[54:58.22]I was hoping I could go up that, but apparently not.
[55:03.66]Just get out of the car.
[55:11.69]Okay, that car just laid eggs.
[55:13.09]I'm the same color as the car.
[55:15.05]And the same sheen.
[55:16.09]Oh wow, you guys were right.
[55:22.63]10k?
[55:34.20]Get back in the clown car.
[55:35.86]And let's go to the... Let's do the... Hold down on the D-pad for the gun.
[55:40.44]Yeah, that's what I was doing before.
[55:43.00]I just don't have it.
[55:43.58]I do not have the gun on me.
[55:47.22]I must have lost it somehow.
[55:54.33]SUV, just in case you need to go off-road.
[55:56.11]Alright, this is going to be interesting.
[56:01.47]I'm not going to hit her this time, I promise.
[56:06.11]I'm a man of my word.
[56:11.59]If I say I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it.
[56:16.56]That was really slippery for no reason.
[56:24.68]Now reverse.
[56:25.32]That's not how it works.
[56:35.22]I can't tell if that's making it faster or slowing.
[56:46.45]Yeah, I think the guy that enters all the races and uses a police vehicle is a cop.
[56:52.45]You know, maybe not.
[56:53.29]I might just be a collector.
[56:54.11]I don't know.
[57:01.47]I'm going to be a collector of rare things.
[57:04.35]And a police SUV car is one.
[57:06.95]Pretty rare.
[57:13.61]Okay.
[57:14.13]Don't drift in this thing.
[57:16.09]This thing weighs too much to drift.
[57:17.59]I don't think I'm going to win.
[57:24.96]Okay.
[57:25.38]Time to just not give a shit about my own well-being and just go crazy and try to get to the front.
[57:39.87]One more up the front.
[57:42.15]There he is.
[57:44.49]86%.
[57:44.51]Come on.
[57:44.75]Give me that.
[57:45.09]Give me one more big turn here.
[57:53.20]Ah, fuck this race.
[58:01.22]Where's my clown car?
[58:05.63]Where's my car?
[58:06.55]I'm gonna have to take one of yours.
[58:09.01]Like this one.
[58:11.83]This one's pretty cool.
[58:12.69]This looks like an old-school Nintendo game.
[58:16.57]It's an Amiibo.
[58:18.21]Can I not get it?
[58:21.79]I think this is his car, considering he's doing the Criss Angel, look at I can float, I'm a magician thing.
[58:36.93]No, I don't want to do them.
[58:39.07]Can you hear this?
[58:43.73]I think somebody may have... I may have been beaten up.
[58:51.93]Oh, shit.
[58:52.39]I can't take this because it's on the marker.
[58:55.75]Hold on.
[58:57.35]Alright.
[58:57.65]Oh.
[59:06.70]Hey!
[59:07.18]Yes, I can.
[59:07.84]Let's go do this favor.
[59:24.39]I'm so glad I got my fucking Nintendo devil car.
[59:29.03]That was close!
[59:34.14]I can.
[59:35.08]Point me in the right direction.
[59:36.00]Do not damage the vehicle.
[59:37.00]Check under the hood.
[59:37.60]Let me get some totals for this first, man.
[59:43.85]Alright, what do we got?
[59:44.91]Let's take a look.
[59:47.43]Hey, so your problem is...
[59:59.74]What?! !
[60:15.64]He's not dead.
[60:21.37]What in the name of God are you thinking?
[60:23.21]Not dying here.
[60:25.17]What in the name of God are you thinking?
[60:29.42]I knew... Don't let him get away!
[60:33.56]I'm gonna have to get out...
[60:49.28]Ow, my head!
[60:53.95]No!
[60:56.83]Oh, my fucking head.
[60:58.87]Ow!
[61:05.80]I would've hit him, too.
[61:07.06]That would've been so perfect, but I...
[61:15.44]Why did that other guy fall down?
[61:16.86]I don't understand.
[61:35.69]That would have been so awesome, and you all know it, and it would have hit him too.
[61:38.91]It's just that he fucking walked by a pillar, which was a person, and it hit that other fucking person, and he... Oh, that would have been so awesome.
[61:48.48]God damn it, why'd there have to be a guy standing there?
[61:53.54]Unbelievable.
[61:54.26]That would have been, like, the biggest fucking Twitch PogChamp moment of my entire online career.
[62:01.81]Alright, let's go.
[62:06.22]Ugh.
[62:08.92]I had a fucking headache.
[62:10.76]This always happens when I play a game like this and I have a headache.
[62:14.16]Eventually, it's just gonna get worse.
[62:15.54]Put on a different radio.
[62:24.67]I don't like that radio station.
[62:27.14]I was trying to hit the lady with the car and it didn't work.
[62:39.91]Wait, why do I have another?
[62:41.45]Where did I get this other door?
[62:45.37]Where am I getting these other doors from?
[62:51.35]Oh, the door's not breaking off.
[62:52.93]Okay.
[62:53.07]What is this?
[62:54.01]Chicken?
[63:00.21]Chicken wants me so badly to do this.
[63:08.10]It's closing.
[63:09.40]Why would it close?
[63:16.01]In West Philadelphia born and raised in the playground where I spent most of my days.
[63:20.53]Is that what's playing right now?
[63:22.89]Listen.
[63:31.20]No, okay.
[63:37.30]Got that guy.
[63:39.94]This is just a mailbox thing.
[63:46.00]Oh, man.
[63:46.40]Alright, what am I doing?
[63:52.29]Oh, yeah.
[63:52.79]I don't have any missions.
[64:01.15]There we go.
[64:07.78]Down here.
[64:12.61]Let's do the drug bust.
[64:15.77]Are these the drug busters?
[64:18.17]Yeah, that's a drug buster over here.
[64:21.97]Okay.
[64:22.59]Who are we going for first?
[64:26.23]Tire iron, cigarettes, bottles.
[64:29.09]Okay, let's do this right.
[64:34.46]This is the trash gang.
[64:39.24]Can I climb up anything?
[64:40.20]Yeah, I'm trying to climb up this shit, but apparently I can't.
[64:44.17]Break his leg.
[64:45.03]Uh-oh.
[64:45.37]Give me the tire iron, thank you!
[65:12.35]I wish you could use the melee weapons for longer.
[65:13.73]It's so much fun.
[65:15.69]Aww.
[65:17.57]Aww.
[65:18.51]I'm gonna get trashed.
[65:32.78]Why is he made out of gold?
[65:33.81]Oh, electrocute his head.
[65:35.53]Okay, if that wouldn't scare you as this guy, I'm not sure what would.
[65:54.84]Nobody gets away from me.
[65:57.88]No one.
[65:59.42]If you commit crimes, you better believe.
[66:04.42]The bison tent, he's gone.
[66:12.95]Hack the camera.
[66:19.85]Ahem.
[66:21.48]Let's get this.
[66:22.04]Okay, zero, nine, eight, seven.
[66:26.40]Zero is in the wrong place.
[66:27.76]Let's go with six.
[66:30.54]Zero.
[66:31.99]Four.
[66:33.23]Two.
[66:33.47]Okay, we've got four is now in the right place.
[66:36.63]Four is in the wrong place, so let's go with four.
[66:41.31]One.
[66:43.15]Three.
[66:48.19]Mm-hmm.
[67:04.51]What's going on?
[67:04.97]What?
[67:05.64]Why did I get out of... What happened to my gate?
[67:09.58]What's going on with my... Am I doing like a Windows update right now?
[67:13.46]What the fuck is going on?
[67:15.44]Cut the shit.
[67:26.31]I'm just... I'm hitting both of them at the same time.
[67:28.41]I think they're both stuck.
[67:37.98]They both don't seem to care anymore.
[67:42.02]Well, I was hoping that something was gonna happen to this.
[67:45.04]He's just dodging me.
[67:47.54]Why am I not kicking this?
[67:49.40]Why is this fucking bike alive?
[67:51.83]He fucking just kicked me in the face.
[67:59.55]Is this guy huge or am I weird?
[68:05.82]If I was ever going to steal somebody's car, I would just do this.
[68:19.55]Like, I would be a sadistic asshole.
[68:21.79]I'd like back up and be like, come on, come get it.
[68:24.31]Like the thing that your friend does.
[68:27.19]When he drives a little bit.
[68:28.27]Okay, I think he doesn't care anymore.
[68:30.51]Is he doing the thing where a dog was pretending to not want the treat?
[68:34.30]Yeah, he is.
[68:36.34]He's doing the thing where the dog pretends to not want the treat and then freaks out and grabs it from your hand.
[68:48.51]Hey, this is your car.
[68:49.53]I stole this from you.
[68:54.42]He's like, huh?
[68:55.42]Let me see, what model is that?
[68:57.40]Hmm, LM472.
[68:58.98]That sounds familiar.
[69:00.78]I think mine was blue, though.
[69:04.74]I don't remember.
[69:08.45]Hey, let me give you a closer look at it, my friend.
[69:15.18]Fucking idiot.
[69:19.18]Cop!
[69:20.68]Cop!
[69:25.50]Cop!
[69:26.46]Get away.
[69:31.37]Cop!
[69:38.12]Yeah, he's the idiot.
[69:39.30]He doesn't know he was examining his own bike that I stole.
[69:51.87]I don't think so.
[70:22.74]That was sick.
[70:24.16]Fuck outta here.
[70:33.11]What do you think this is, a game?
[70:35.41]Phew.
[70:41.51]What a stress reliever this game is.
[70:47.78]Bald fight.
[70:49.16]Oh, we got a bald fight.
[70:50.14]I don't have any missions.
[70:52.83]Can I call somebody?
[70:53.63]Hey, Tiffany.
[70:55.85]Tiffany, it's Wade.
[70:56.88]Oh, hi.
[70:58.38]How are you?
[70:59.46]I'm good.
[71:00.60]Listen, you busy later?
[71:02.30]Well, I'm working.
[71:04.26]Why?
[71:04.46]I was thinking of dropping by Bam Bam to see you.
[71:06.96]Oh, that'd be great.
[71:08.90]You want to sing karaoke?
[71:12.14]No.
[71:12.52]Okay, I'm going to stand her up because I don't want to do this.
[71:16.76]Let's, okay, here's what we're gonna do.
[71:17.71]We're gonna make, this is, this is like the way to make plans.
[71:20.31]We're gonna make plans with three people, and then decide which one sounds like the most fun, and go.
[71:25.51]Okay, what about, hold on, what about you?
[71:46.78]Yo, Tran, what you got for me?
[71:48.31]I need a sports car.
[71:49.95]Let me ask the customer the specifics.
[71:51.55]I'll text them over.
[71:52.29]Alright.
[71:55.55]I think the walk in the park sounds more fun to me.
[72:04.34]Hey, fuck off.
[72:06.72]Find the spark.
[72:07.62]Tiffany's song.
[72:09.06]Let's go.
[72:09.44]We're going to take pictures of Amanda.
[72:10.96]That sounds like fun, doesn't it?
[72:16.00]Here we go.
[72:25.50]I don't care about speed.
[72:28.41]I don't care about anything.
[72:29.23]I don't care about anything.
[72:30.23]You see?
[72:31.59]See just how much I don't give a fuck?
[72:34.59]I'm rabid.
[72:37.76]Don't even give a fuck.
[72:38.64]You know what I'm saying?
[72:42.68]I'll ride a wheelie on the back.
[72:44.18]You know what I mean?
[72:45.48]I don't even give a fuck.
[72:49.08]It looks like the car is supposed to be driven like this.
[72:51.63]Doesn't it?
[72:54.57]I'm on a... what are those stand-up scooters that weren't popular and you have to be a mall security guard to use them nowadays?
[73:00.87]What are they called?
[73:01.41]They're like little... two wheels!
[73:11.10]Why can I do this?
[73:14.64]Segway!
[73:15.16]Segway!
[73:15.56]That's right, I'm on a Segway.
[73:20.13]I already missed my exit.
[73:21.27]Fuck!
[73:26.87]Excuse me, sir.
[73:28.45]The mall closes in 15 minutes.
[73:30.81]You're not supposed to be here.
[73:31.95]Did you hear what I just fucking said?
[73:44.10]Why did he do that?
[73:51.87]Get out of the way.
[73:55.87]Where's my Segway?
[73:56.97]Okay, back to it.
[74:00.23]Go to bed.
[74:02.29]Okay, photograph Amanda.
[74:03.51]We'll go this way.
[74:08.11]We're going off around here.
[74:10.65]There it is.
[74:11.17]Let's actually get off the highway.
[74:20.13]Paul Blart 2?
[74:31.99]I'm stuck in this person's car.
[74:33.47]Oh my god.
[74:34.56]Lie.
[74:35.74]Nice lie.
[74:47.74]Drifting is actually pretty fun in this game though.
[74:51.20]Just dicking around.
[74:55.16]Shit like that.
[74:55.80]Full 360 degrees Fahrenheit.
[75:03.85]Tony Hawk!
[75:06.69]Almost.
[75:12.73]Tony Hawk, when you go up the ramp and you come back down.
[75:21.26]Speed Celsius?
[75:22.08]No, we already went over this.
[75:22.94]I'm American.
[75:27.32]Big drift up here.
[75:28.12]Check this out.
[75:29.32]Ready?
[75:34.70]Kind of.
[75:35.84]Okay, we're gonna go all the way up to the park.
[75:47.51]Big drift.
[75:48.13]Check out this circle.
[75:57.36]Nice!
[76:06.89]Wait, hi.
[76:08.24]Hey, Amanda.
[76:09.28]I clearly just ran over.
[76:10.42]What's going on?
[76:11.14]It's closed.
[76:12.52]Why is it closed?
[76:13.40]The public is only allowed in on the weekends.
[76:15.76]This sucks.
[76:16.76]I wanted some pictures for my blog.
[76:19.38]Let me see what I can do.

[76:40.21]No.
[76:42.59]What the fuck are we doing?
[76:43.41]This is just... This is just at the convention with your boyfriend, and you're not dressed up, but he is.

[76:58.11]Yeah, I have to say, that dress looks really good on you.

[78:32.29]A thousand fucking dollars.
[78:55.97]Jesus Christ, that's a lot of money.
[79:05.35]I was so eager to get in.
[79:06.47]Okay, let's get some more photos.

[79:53.22]That looks good.
[79:53.68]I think this is a good spot.
[80:03.75]It has to be green.
[80:19.21]There.
[80:23.45]I hope I don't actually fail this.
[80:24.89]Because it's actually lined up with some kind of template or something.
[80:32.40]Oh, I can't take one now?
[80:34.03]One more.
[80:36.48]Okay.
[80:46.98]So blurry.
[80:48.58]That's great.
[80:56.90]This is like, where's Waldo?
[80:58.65]No problem.
[81:00.35]My pleasure.
[81:03.65]That was great.
[81:05.33]Thank you so much.
[81:06.39]I can't believe you got us in here.
[81:07.61]That's no problem.
[81:08.89]Those are like I'm hiding taking pictures of someone.
[81:11.58]That's fucking creepy.
[81:14.24]Thanks again, though, for taking the time to, you know, do this.
[81:18.62]She looks like one of those eye machines.
[81:20.94]So, uh, was this, like, a date?
[81:25.63]Sounds good to me.
[81:27.11]What do you think?
[81:27.69]Definitely.
[81:28.71]I mean, uh, yeah.
[81:31.71]Yeah, that sounds great.
[81:33.55]Well, thank you for the date, then.
[81:38.75]Well, that one moved quick.
[81:40.61]That moved a little... That moved fast.
[81:44.83]You took four pictures and all of a sudden... That's kissable now.
[81:54.37]Health Shrines now appear on the mini-map.
[81:56.45]Well, that's helpful.
[82:05.17]Okay, well... Hold on.
[82:08.45]What do you mean?
[82:10.08]Is it implied that we just had an encounter?
[82:15.12]Here.
[82:17.40]Right here.
[82:17.98]Like, right there.
[82:18.54]It's illegal, man.
[82:21.67]Okay, we just had an encounter in the fountain.
[82:34.14]Slim Jim in there.
[82:34.84]Let's get going.
[82:35.94]Let's go on another date.
[82:38.28]I'm in the mood to go on some dates.
[82:54.14]Why?
[82:55.40]Why does that happen sometimes?
[82:57.48]That was your fault.
[82:59.80]That was your fault.
[83:02.82]I didn't do anything.
[83:10.07]Got away with it.
[83:17.62]Cheater streamer?
[83:18.50]What?
[83:18.96]That's not my girlfriend.
[83:22.66]Where did it say that we were girlfriend and boyfriend?
[83:26.16]I'm just a guy trying to find somebody.
[83:28.85]Just wanted to check out, see who's out there.
[83:32.37]I'm just a guy looking for someone, you know?
[83:43.51]I'm just a giant Oscar statue, just trying to find true love in the world.
[83:50.68]You don't find that by taking a few pictures and getting a smooch, you know what I'm saying?
[83:54.98]You need to know who else is out there.
[83:56.26]What if I go to, like, somewhere, and somebody's a really big fan of the movie?
[84:03.84]This is pretty crazy.
[84:08.58]Does that constitute stealing?
[84:10.32]Or is that an accident?
[84:16.74]She's gonna fall in love with the Oscar.
[84:18.22]What's the guy's name?
[84:19.50]What's the actual statue's name?
[84:20.92]The Oscar.
[84:21.62]Oscar the Grouch?
[84:24.24]Oscar like, who is it?
[84:25.30]Like Dean?
[84:27.24]Who's the guy that's the Oscar statue?
[84:30.26]Dean Martin?
[84:40.37]It's just Oscar.
[84:44.26]Oscar... Oscar Mayer?
[84:53.90]Oscar Mayer, yeah, that's who it's named after for his golden fucking turkey wraps.
[84:58.30]His golden turkey bacon.
[85:02.23]If only.
[85:15.81]This GPS is taking me in such a strange way.
[85:18.34]I'm just going to go that way.
[85:20.64]Why am I going all the way around the whole world?
[85:23.54]Oh, okay.
[85:23.92]Destruction.
[85:24.46]God damn it.
[85:27.28]God damn it.
[85:27.78]Destruction.
[85:36.04]Opportunity here for a bowling trophy.
[85:40.48]Looks like there's a lot of people down here.
[85:43.60]Police are already here.
[85:47.26]Oh, turn the music off.
[85:47.96]I don't understand this.
[85:48.96]So the cops are... Why are they... There's a bunch of criminals here and there's a bunch of cops over there.
[85:58.51]Is there a reason for this?
[85:59.89]Or am I missing something?
[86:03.61]Are they just... Am I messing up a sting operation?
[86:08.92]I don't know.
[86:09.74]What's going on in here?
[86:10.38]What are you guys doing?
[86:16.33]This is a crime scene.
[86:20.41]Okay, well, watch out for the other criminals that are right next to the crime scene.
[86:23.86]Let's see what happens if we start a war here.
[86:25.52]And I see the case.
[86:26.14]Yeah, let's start a war.
[86:29.72]Time for a goddamn war.
[86:35.35]Okay, guys.
[86:36.57]Put the cameras down.
[86:38.67]I brought us some action.
[86:45.59]Put down the camera.
[86:51.26]Really?
[86:51.56]Are you seriously gonna let this just happen?
[86:55.76]Apparently you are.
[87:00.90]It won't hit him.
[87:01.65]Why?
[87:01.89]This is fucking bullshit!
[87:08.65]Help!
[87:09.75]Do something!
[87:13.25]Do something!
[87:15.65]Shoot him!
[87:16.57]Good job.
[87:17.31]See, all it took, guys, I had to like rile him up.
[87:19.45]I had to reboot him.
[87:21.53]Oh shit, hold on.
[87:23.59]New allegiance, new allegiance, new alliance.
[87:26.50]Uh, guys, where'd you all go?
[87:28.00]Where'd you all go?
[87:30.48]Where did the guy, where did all the criminals go that were right here?
[87:36.12]They arrested that guy.
[87:37.78]Where are the criminals?
[87:44.11]That did not go as anticipated.
[87:45.53]Alright, we're gonna have to do Scooter here.
[87:50.35]I need that case.
[87:53.76]GO!
[87:55.68]I can wrap around and get the case.
[88:05.26]Alright, we're fine.
[88:12.45]Get the case.
[88:17.19]That was such bullshit.
[88:21.18]And now they're just here again.
[88:25.74]This is not even the... Alright, whatever.
[88:26.96]We'll get in this case.
[88:27.80]Let go.
[88:30.08]Let go of me!
[88:34.12]Let go of me!
[88:52.21]Damn little asshole!
[88:53.01]Okay, I'm in trouble.
[88:55.27]I hate the grabbers.
[88:58.28]I'm gonna go for a running kick here.
[89:01.44]Dead.
[89:01.98]Okay, give me the case.
[89:18.74]10k.
[89:19.14]I have so much money.
[89:19.90]Oh, I have $340,000.
[89:20.18]Can I spend some money?
[89:20.82]Fuck you.
[89:21.14]That guy's talented.
[89:52.20]Case!
[89:52.46]Can I pick this up?
[90:01.34]Oh, this is not a smart idea.
[90:02.75]I'm rolling this into the street.
[90:05.89]Wait a minute.
[90:07.21]Come on.
[90:07.57]Stop the fucking bomb sausage for a second.
[90:12.09]Oh!
[90:13.33]The audience just went, oh!
[90:15.71]Oh!
[90:16.99]Put it in there.
[90:17.45]Put that clip in there.
[90:18.28]Audience every time.
[90:18.98]We're going to play chicken with this thing.
[90:22.47]I gotta go long ways.
[90:23.79]I'm not sure I can.
[90:34.12]God damn it.
[90:37.50]Okay, wait, hold on, hold on.
[90:41.53]No, no, stop rolling it.
[90:51.69]Ooh, no, no, not back to me.
[90:53.75]Oh god, this thing is primed.
[91:04.05]This thing is primed to blow, it really is.
[91:07.09]We got some more cars coming?
[91:08.84]I want to bring this to the highway.
[91:09.98]Where's the highway?
[91:12.04]Okay, new plan.
[91:13.84]I'm gonna roll this all the way to the highway.
[91:17.76]So we need to go, like, here.
[91:19.90]Here.
[91:21.49]Okay.
[91:22.81]Nice and easy here.
[91:23.61]Let's get it.
[91:24.03]Just need to go this way.
[91:26.73]We need to roll it up here.
[91:30.44]If you guys don't think I found the thing I want to do right now, you're sadly mistaken.
[91:33.92]I'm just rolling my knapsack.
[91:44.47]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[91:48.69]No, we're good.
[91:49.33]We're good.
[91:49.61]We're good.
[91:49.85]I gotta be quiet.
[91:50.35]I gotta be quiet.
[91:51.55]Not quiet.
[91:51.97]I gotta be considerate.
[91:55.24]Watch out.
[91:55.58]Okay, here we go.
[91:56.54]Up there.
[92:00.08]It likes to get stuck on walls.
[92:02.14]Don't worry.
[92:03.68]Enagling will get it unstuck.
[92:05.14]Here it comes.
[92:10.31]Alright.
[92:12.41]This is gonna be worth it, guys.
[92:13.43]I promise.
[92:17.40]Playing ping pong with myself right now.
[92:20.32]I gotta get it long ways.
[92:27.08]Alright, well, whatever.
[92:27.64]We're going this way, because apparently this is the way it's going.
[92:30.09]We can make it go pretty fast.
[92:32.09]I'll get that on the way back.
[92:33.11]I'm not doing it now.
[92:34.05]This thing will despawn.
[92:42.25]It's not gonna explode?
[92:43.11]Yes, it is.
[92:54.70]Fuck you.
[92:55.06]A bit better.
[92:56.32]It has to be the other way.
[92:58.60]I'm this far.
[92:59.32]I can't give up now.
[93:00.58]It's not possible.
[93:01.28]I'm not giving up now.
[93:06.42]This is biblical at this point.
[93:12.25]There we go.
[93:13.15]Come on.
[93:13.51]Roll it that way.
[93:14.67]Finesse it.
[93:15.27]Come on.
[93:26.59]You guys wanna see the process?
[93:27.81]Here's the process!
[93:37.23]I might as well just- I think I'm gonna get a car and drive over it.
[93:45.38]Trust the process.
[93:49.16]We're almost on the on-ramp.
[93:55.54]NOO!
[93:58.94]Fucking hell.
[94:02.38]I'm going up a hill.
[94:04.06]Of course that's gonna happen.
[94:06.50]Alright, get out of the way.
[94:07.48]Go.
[94:07.84]Drive the car.
[94:10.08]Drive the car!
[94:11.79]Drive the car.
[94:13.31]If you want, I will.
[94:15.69]Fucking idiot.
[94:33.37]I think this might be ruined.
[94:34.55]I don't think, can it not explode?
[94:42.27]It can't.
[94:44.99]That's annoying.
[94:47.37]Trust the process, he says.
[94:49.63]Process doesn't even work.
[94:53.41]Unbelievable.
[95:00.89]That's so annoying.
[95:01.87]I'm so sad and annoyed right now.
[95:05.61]Trust the pro- I can't shoot without a gun.
[95:08.89]That's not how- What do you mean that's not how gas works?
[95:20.29]Contents under pressure will explode.
[95:21.83]I need somebody with a gun to come shoot me here.
[95:28.13]Whatever, I give up.
[95:33.60]I gave up.
[95:37.46]Gonna go on another date.
[95:43.98]Okay.
[95:48.52]GPS updated.
[95:49.38]I'm gonna follow the GPS.
[95:56.96]Karaoke time.
[95:58.55]Oh, that's right.
[95:59.21]This is what this is.
[96:02.54]Are we gonna lie down with each other?
[96:04.46]That guy is spring-loaded.
[96:07.68]Good.
[96:11.24]There's another shrine right here, though.
[96:15.74]Or is it?
[96:16.26]It's on the mini-map.
[96:22.81]Shrine?
[96:23.41]Maybe that's a... Is that an already consumed shrine?
[96:25.55]Might be up top.
[96:33.18]Well, I already got that one.
[96:36.51]I can do both of these at the same time.
[96:37.83]Let's get... No, the spark is right here.
[96:39.31]I'm going to get this first.
[96:39.97]It's as easy as standing in the middle of the road.
[96:47.19]Perfect timing.
[96:47.89]Perfect timing.
[96:48.41]Perfect timing.
[96:48.91]Perfect timing.
[96:51.25]And there he is.
[96:54.91]What's up?
[96:58.24]I will take your car.
[97:03.30]Return to Trans Garage.
[97:07.44]That's pretty far away.
[97:13.42]Whoa, this is worth $42,000.
[97:15.38]Be easy about this.
[97:16.48]As long as I don't crash into anything, right?
[97:25.65]I gotta go here after.
[97:26.41]I wanna kill that guy so bad.
[97:28.81]But I can't.
[97:30.75]Have some self-control.
[97:36.12]And then I want to buy something.
[97:37.42]I've got all this money and nothing to do with it, apparently.
[97:41.16]I need to go buy shit.
[97:42.60]Let's go to the clothing store.
[97:43.45]We're going to take off the Oscar Meyer outfit.
[97:47.77]See if I can get the Just Cause outfit on.
[97:49.33]That sounds like fun.
[97:55.01]Oh, I just lost $200.
[97:55.61]It's alright.
[97:55.99]As long as I get over $40, I'm fine.
[98:07.91]What do you buy the man that has everything?
[98:11.19]This is true.
[98:13.97]What do you do?
[98:17.78]Here we go.
[98:22.76]Delivery!
[98:23.34]Oh, I gotta get it in the garage.
[98:27.48]Nice and easy.
[98:29.22]I'll take 42 grand, please.
[98:35.05]Nice.
[98:36.75]Alright.
[98:51.87]You wasted a very, very perfectly good drink.
[98:54.40]I'm so sick of this shit.
[99:08.45]You wish that one.
[99:10.15]Try another.
[99:14.65]After this, we're gonna go get a new legendary outfit.
[99:22.20]We need some new legendaries, I'd say.
[99:23.50]Almost 400k.
[99:24.98]Bam bam!
[99:34.45]Everyone's going to scream at me.
[99:36.08]I know it's the other side.
[99:37.36]Other side of the road.
[99:39.48]I know.
[99:40.22]But the GPS told me to go here.
[99:43.00]That's where the GPS told me to go.
[99:46.60]No.
[99:46.82]And it is that way.
[99:47.76]It is that side.
[99:49.05]It is that side of the road.
[99:50.11]The GPS told me to go there and then I had second thoughts.
[99:55.21]It is right here.
[100:01.92]Where is the entrance?
[100:07.81]Go to bed.
[100:08.37]No, fuck off.
[100:09.05]I'm not going to bed.
[100:09.69]I'm gonna walk around in a goddamn circle.
[100:21.50]Isn't it on the corner?
[100:22.36]Isn't there a guy taking a picture?
[100:24.18]Yeah, it's right here.
[100:25.39]Fucking GPS.
[100:29.51]I'm a regular here.
[100:30.27]I don't need to do shit.
[100:39.65]Hey, how are you?
[100:40.43]Hey, Tiffany.
[100:41.49]I'm here to be your singing boyfriend.
[100:43.79]Hey, Tiffany.
[100:46.55]Oh, you're here.
[100:47.83]I've got everything set up.
[100:50.15]There's no escaping karaoke here, is there?
[100:51.69]There's no bathroom.
[100:53.67]You want to sing first?
[100:59.63]Alright, what song am I going to do here?
[101:03.75]Sing a song for Tiffany.
[101:04.99]It's got to be good.
[101:08.93]I fought the law we already did that all out of love feeling reeling in the years how about all out of love sounds good we'll just do the whole damn song this is I really don't want to do this
[101:34.13]Why are the only two people in this club?
[101:37.38]She's just talking over the song.
[101:45.62]I'm not going to do it terrible.
[101:46.70]I want to have a good date.
[102:00.57]It's hard to do the little mid ones because the analog has to push up.
[102:11.87]I'm- look at how awkward I am.
[102:15.83]I'm moving my hands around so strangely.
[102:17.93]There's a guy with no rhythm just like, you can sing but geez man.
[102:22.67]You need something to do with your hands.
[102:24.82]I'm doing it perfect.
[102:33.82]He's doing the toddler dance.
[102:38.28]This is what a three-year-old does when they hear music that they enjoy.
[102:43.17]Like when Trolls Holiday is on the TV.
[102:46.95]And your three-year-old niece is just dancing around like this.
[102:54.35]I added some, uh, rubato, whatever it's called.
[103:13.04]It was better that way.
[103:43.48]He was like an evoker to Ron.
[103:47.90]He really is a robot.
[103:53.44]Is there anything you'd like me to sing?
[103:55.49]Yeah.
[103:56.23]No, thanks.
[103:57.69]Maybe next time.
[103:59.79]I should get going.
[104:00.91]Really?
[104:01.27]So soon?
[104:01.91]You don't want me to sit on your lap and sing for you?
[104:06.20]That's the kind of thing clients usually want.
[104:08.52]Wait, what?
[104:10.48]Well, you put it like that.
[104:14.50]Let's go sing.
[104:15.18]We're just going on, like, dates.
[104:17.16]You ready to go crazy?
[104:18.88]I'm a pro.
[104:20.10]Wait a minute, I think this is... Is this part two?
[104:22.44]I have to sing, too?
[104:23.11]Nope.
[104:26.25]Okay.
[104:30.01]Gate statues appear on your mini-map.
[104:32.09]That's so... Okay, that's really, really insane.
[104:35.57]I'm glad I did both of these.
[104:40.08]Okay, anything else we can do in here?
[104:42.66]What else?
[104:42.98]What other cool things can I do in here?
[104:45.08]Right?
[104:47.40]I want to get into the... I want to get up there.
[104:50.22]You see what I'm saying, guys?
[104:51.52]I'm getting into the crow's nest.
[104:53.72]I'll find a way.
[104:58.19]Let me go upstairs.
[104:59.13]If there's a way I can get into the crow's nest and just start dancing.
[105:02.05]That's my goal.
[105:03.69]I'm dressed for the part.
[105:08.92]Are you kidding me?
[105:09.44]Like, they're gonna get mad?
[105:10.54]No.
[105:10.88]I will draw so many more customers.
[105:14.72]Who's the metallic fucking bronze statue man?
[105:18.64]I would be... I would pay attention to whatever he was doing.
[105:21.13]Okay.
[105:23.17]Can I?
[105:24.05]No.
[105:25.71]Here it is.
[105:28.69]What was that?
[105:29.65]Damn.
[105:30.90]Told you.
[105:38.09]I want to get in the crow's test and dance!
[105:40.43]Not here.
[105:41.05]No one's even watching me over here.
[105:43.61]This is just boring and awkward.
[105:44.99]I'm like a fucking weirdo.
[105:47.92]This is the guy that's at the club that's on drugs that's in the corner by himself.
[105:50.76]Has anybody ever... Okay, will this guy notice?
[105:56.94]Somebody give me what I'm looking for.
[106:11.58]I'm just a weird person.
[106:12.60]That's it.
[106:12.92]Can I dance with these people?
[106:20.29]I'm trying to dance with these people.
[106:21.67]I can't do it.
[106:24.63]I mean, technically we're dancing.
[106:25.95]Technically.
[106:28.89]I guess not.
[106:29.63]Alright, let's go.
[106:32.05]Can I go in here?
[106:33.81]No.
[106:36.22]Shower me with attention.
[106:37.30]Can I buy a drink?
[106:40.38]I can't even buy a drink.
[106:41.31]What the fuck?
[106:52.45]Important.
[106:52.97]Get out of the way.
[106:55.80]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[106:57.66]No.
[106:57.84]I think this is just a karaoke house.
[107:01.92]Nothing else.
[107:02.72]Let's go.
[107:03.18]I mean, I could... What's over here?
[107:05.34]Bathroom?
[107:15.59]Alright.
[107:37.11]Imagine doing that to someone.
[107:41.43]Excuse me.
[107:42.61]There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 open fucking stalls.
[108:00.40]Okay, I'm just a dog.
[108:02.06]That's all this is.
[108:03.48]You know when a dog is done using the bathroom, he's done walking, but he still pees on everything?
[108:08.39]But he doesn't have any pee left?
[108:10.49]He's like, no, no, no, I gotta go this way.
[108:11.59]And he lifts his leg up and nothing comes out.
[108:13.47]That's what I'm doing.
[108:14.20]I'm marking my territory in every single stall in the bathroom.
[108:29.29]Gold peeing gold.
[108:35.23]That's it?
[108:36.11]I'm running out.
[108:36.67]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[108:37.75]I'm running out.
[108:48.12]Why is it doing... I'm going peeing for one second.
[108:54.40]Alright, that's enough.
[108:55.84]That's enough.
[108:57.08]I've had enough.
[109:05.20]I want someone to be sitting in one of these.
[109:07.30]There's a guy in this one.
[109:14.52]What the fuck are you doing in here?
[109:16.15]I can't get in there.
[109:20.17]I can't get in there.
[109:20.77]Get me in there!
[109:33.80]Nope.
[109:35.61]They locked it.
[109:37.11]Assholes.
[109:39.61]He's peeing on her.
[109:43.22]Alright, time to go.
[109:44.00]This was fun.
[109:49.54]Can I request a song?
[109:52.88]Why am I only allowed to- There we go!
[109:55.00]Finally.
[109:55.48]This girl is sweating.
[110:06.61]Look at those gigantic pit stains.
[110:08.79]You've been here for a while.
[110:11.55]You don't give a fuck.
[110:13.89]Alright.
[110:26.01]Who's calling me?
[110:27.08]Oh, wait a minute.
[110:29.30]This is another date.
[110:38.08]This is another date.
[110:38.94]I'm about to go on another date with a third person.
[110:41.99]Sure.
[110:43.79]Nobody can resist.
[110:47.39]You think you can resist the Bicentennial Man?
[110:50.91]Don't think so.
[110:58.28]Get out.
[111:06.18]The Bicentennial Man is rude.
[111:13.07]So what are we going to do on this date?
[111:14.57]I'm concerned about how many dates we're going on recently.
[111:21.50]Yeah, Pee-wee.
[111:22.96]Make sure you get the mail.
[111:25.08]Wow, Cherry.
[111:25.86]Okay, I will.
[111:27.44]Thanks, Pee-wee.
[111:32.75]What's the word of the day?
[111:34.17]You're fucking it up.
[111:34.85]You're fucking it up.
[111:35.51]I'm trying to make it so it's just opening on its own.
[111:37.03]Watch out.
[111:53.17]I'm here.
[111:56.21]Let's listen to some tunes.
[112:00.56]We can have some fun.
[112:02.28]I'm gonna be taught... What are we teaching?
[112:04.74]What are we doing?
[112:05.28]Are we stealing?
[112:19.08]Distract the cop Easy That's not distracting at all
[112:49.51]You sure?
[112:51.57]You positive.
[113:01.19]This is not distracting.
[113:09.52]He wants that ice cream really bad.
[113:13.35]Hey!
[113:13.73]I'm sorry.
[113:14.11]Let's just go.
[113:14.71]Hey, distract that cop over there.
[113:18.41]AKA, please don't assault him.
[113:38.39]Hey, man.
[113:38.65]Sir.
[113:53.50]Okay.
[113:53.92]Done.
[113:54.56]Done.
[113:54.90]Do the mission.
[113:55.52]Done.
[113:55.88]Enough fucking nonsense.
[113:57.16]Go.
[113:57.48]I made it turn around.
[114:02.74]That was just... I just pranked him.
[114:04.65]That's all it was.
[114:05.29]Okay.
[114:06.03]Go.
[114:18.00]Okay, now what?
[114:19.11]What's next on my list of things to do?
[114:20.39]If I get somebody behind me to round up and punch me in the head.
[114:25.35]Okay, I got it.
[114:26.63]So these are hacking missions.
[114:27.75]I'm on a hacking date with my nerd girlfriend.
[114:51.10]Okay, hack it.
[114:52.54]Cop returns in one minute.
[114:53.69]Gotta get this right.
[114:54.33]Oh shit, this is gonna be hard.
[115:24.88]How'd you know how to do that?
[115:25.80]I have my ways.
[115:27.06]Not going to tell me?
[115:28.50]Maybe I can find a way to bribe you later.
[115:31.86]Where the fuck is she going?
[115:32.56]What are you doing?
[115:35.12]Do I have to get down?
[115:36.39]Ice cream!
[115:38.15]Flavors for cute customers?
[115:40.43]Wait!
[115:41.03]Ice cream!
[115:42.25]Oh, okay.
[115:43.55]So, that was, um, like, pretty fun.
[115:46.19]I didn't know you were so into tech stuff.
[115:48.87]Yeah, I'm into all sorts of crazy shit.
[115:51.40]I bet.
[115:51.94]You know, like having sex with three women in the same day, in the same hour, probably in the same 45-minute spin, apparently.
[115:59.26]Look at my address.
[116:00.94]You're still just not paying to me.
[116:03.77]That's cute.
[116:04.51]Am I calling her?
[116:05.37]I like that.
[116:06.71]So you want to set me straight?
[116:07.81]Eventually.
[116:10.11]Most likely.
[116:11.53]Alright.
[116:13.29]I guess we'll see what it takes to get it out of you.
[116:16.33]God this is like Oh my fucking god Did he just say nice one He did these guys all watched Hey nice, man By the way, I still don't have any missions
[116:49.41]Does that say Bicentennial?
[116:50.78]Oh, I thought it said Bicentennial Man.
[116:52.36]I have to go to bed.
[116:53.58]I have to go to sleep.
[116:55.22]No, I don't.
[116:55.66]Sleep is for the weak.
[116:56.94]I'm a Bicentennial Man.
[117:18.75]Alright, I'll go to bed.
[117:20.87]Bedtime.
[117:23.59]First, hold on.
[117:28.47]Got another upgrade to do.
[117:29.94]So this is strike resistant.
[117:32.40]I'm already strike resistant.
[117:33.48]Melee weapon sprint attacks.
[117:36.52]Oh, um, yes.
[117:40.10]That sounds fucking fun.
[117:45.36]Alright, let's go to, um...
[117:49.04]Up here.
[117:52.72]Up here.
[117:53.76]Go to bed.
[118:00.04]Change your outfit.
[118:01.18]Just hold on.
[118:02.32]I will.
[118:03.38]Alright, you know what?
[118:03.96]Before bed, let's get a new outfit.
[118:05.74]I agree.
[118:06.60]Let's do that.
[118:10.54]We're gonna go get another one.
[118:12.11]Legendary outfits.
[118:14.25]Okay.
[118:14.83]The people have spoken.
[118:15.59]I'm not changing the title, though.
[118:27.68]I have a lot of money, so let's get the one that's the most fun.
[118:37.99]Is it bad that you like this game more than GTA V?
[118:41.27]No.
[118:44.01]It's just your own opinion of what you like and don't like.
[118:48.80]GTA V is an amazing game.
[118:52.77]This is pretty good, too.
[118:56.15]I mean, obviously, I think GTA Rockstar has more money.
[118:59.67]So they can do more shit.
[119:03.01]But this is good.
[119:04.84]I'm having a lot of fun.
[119:05.54]I think this is a great game.
[119:19.63]GTA is one of my favorite series.
[119:21.43]GTA 5 is one of my favorite games.
[119:23.09]I love it.
[119:23.41]Alright, preset outfits.
[119:26.01]Tactical.
[119:27.51]Assault rifle with grenade launcher.
[119:29.87]50% reduction in damage from gunfire.
[119:33.71]Wield the lightning warrior sword.
[119:35.43]Okay, that sounds insane.
[119:39.66]Revolver with grenade launcher.
[119:41.16]Action hijack vehicles at a greater distance.
[119:45.23]Okay.
[119:46.45]I get a Revolver with a Grenade Launcher.
[119:50.42]FR-27 Sanctioned Flechette Rifle.
[119:55.22]Silver Baller Pistols.
[119:59.88]Sun Wukong.
[120:03.39]Where's the, um... I thought he said it was a Grapple Hook.
[120:09.11]Counters are easier to perform.
[120:10.49]Melee Damage.
[120:15.27]Alright, what do you guys want?
[120:20.81]I don't want to do anything that makes the game stupidly easy.
[120:27.34]This one?
[120:27.70]Alright, let's do a poll because... Alright, it's Rico Rodriguez, Lightning Warrior.
[120:37.26]This is just like... It's impossible for me to lose if I use this.
[120:41.22]Or Drunken Fist.
[120:42.30]Lightning Warrior, Rico Rodriguez, or Drunken Fist.
[120:49.77]Let's get a pull.
[121:02.06]Uh, Rico.
[121:04.26]Drunken.
[121:05.98]Or sword guy.
[121:07.32]Yakuza.
[121:10.62]What do you mean Yakuza?
[121:13.51]Yakuza style.
[121:14.31]Heat level goes up half as fast.
[121:16.05]No, I'm not doing the funny naked guy one.
[121:20.13]No, sorry.
[121:20.82]I just realized why you guys are saying this.
[121:23.16]No.
[121:25.32]Everybody wants me to do this because I'm naked.
[121:29.52]No.
[121:36.53]There you go.
[121:37.49]Those are your options.
[121:41.95]Are we doing Just Cause, Drunken Man, or the Sword Man?
[121:54.98]Pretty close so far.
[121:57.04]Nobody wants to see Rico.
[121:58.28]It's either Drunken Fist or Lightning Katana.
[122:05.60]This one is almost all the money I currently possess.
[122:12.10]Lightning Warrior has pulled ahead.
[122:16.76]And we have the Lightning Warrior sword.
[122:23.34]Yes, Rico is the grappling hook.
[122:25.92]Drunken is when I... Will this guy stop talking over me?
[122:30.51]I can't hear myself think.
[122:32.93]Rico is the grapple hook.
[122:34.89]Drunken is when you fill up the face meter, you get shit-faced.
[122:38.77]And sword guy is I have a lightning sword.
[122:44.94]I'm giving this about five more seconds, and then I'm picking Lightning Warrior for 350 fucking thousand dollars.
[122:56.73]That's it.
[122:58.65]That's it.
[122:59.21]Pole is closed.
[122:59.83]That's it.
[123:01.49]Lightning Warrior outfit is being purchased.
[123:10.21]There goes all my money.
[123:12.11]Thank you for voting.
[123:13.93]Let's hope this was worth it.
[123:26.50]Oh, Jesus.
[123:26.98]I really do have... I have, like, a Power Ranger's sword.
[123:29.08]Oh, my God.
[123:33.92]No.
[123:34.60]Really?
[123:36.29]This looks like a Walmart foam sword.
[123:39.21]Do I have this forever?
[123:42.77]Oh, shit.
[123:43.15]Oh, shit.
[123:43.47]Oh, shit.
[123:43.81]Oh, shit.
[123:44.13]Out, out, out.
[123:44.59]What happens if I lose it?
[123:46.01]Nice outfit.
[124:09.25]Did you see that?
[124:11.07]Oh my god.
[124:12.23]You can do a Peter Pan dive.
[124:13.69]Okay, this might be worth it now because of this.
[124:32.67]God damn it.
[124:38.70]Come on, I have... Hold X. That's what I'm doing.
[124:53.34]Yeah, why is it called Lightning Warrior Sword?
[124:58.16]Because he is one, two, three.
[125:03.46]Can I activate its power?
[125:04.97]Maybe when I get the full phase?
[125:06.07]I'm not sure.
[125:13.84]Alright, let's go home and sleep.
[125:22.92]No, I'm not... I'm not changing outfits.
[125:26.11]This was selected and it was 350 fucking thousand dollars.
[125:30.73]So we have to sleep in the bed that was made by the democracy.
[125:49.38]Don't take any photos of me!
[125:58.26]Okay, I like to sleep in the bed with my weapon.
[126:04.62]This really sucks, I tell you what.
[126:12.20]See?
[126:12.38]It's still there.
[126:19.22]Ah, fuck, my back!
[126:23.20]Why do I sleep with this thing every night?
[126:24.95]What's wrong with me?
[126:39.91]Where is it?
[126:40.73]Is it under the bed?
[126:41.43]Uh-oh.
[126:46.62]There it is.
[126:47.00]I got it.
[126:47.32]I got it.
[126:47.80]Everything's fine.
[126:49.38]What the hell are you doing?
[126:51.11]Pick it up and put it away.
[126:58.07]I guess I can't put it away.
[126:59.42]Bridge.
[127:06.83]I'm gonna drink like six of these.
[127:07.89]I'm gonna do the surveillance bust.
[127:19.36]Why would I... God.
[127:21.78]Alright, let's go here.
[127:23.06]Yen Yen Fu Long Underpass.
[127:28.50]Old material?
[127:29.08]No, it would be old material if I were to go pee.
[127:30.76]Alright, well, there we go.
[127:35.27]It was these guys right here.
[127:38.68]You're under arrest.
[127:41.66]We just saw a briefcase switcheroo.
[127:46.66]Yep.
[127:48.40]I've seen plenty of movies to know that that's how we go down, you know what I'm saying?
[127:56.60]Stop tossing it on the floor.
[127:57.68]I'm not.
[127:57.98]I'm not.
[127:58.38]The game's doing it for me.
[127:59.28]I can't do anything unless I... Well, now it actually is gone.
[128:03.41]So, where is my sword?
[128:21.01]Yeah, give me this.
[128:24.57]So where's the sword?
[128:41.80]Do I just get it?
[128:45.01]Yellow jumpsuit.
[128:46.05]No, I'm not doing a yellow jumpsuit.
[128:50.44]I think I have to change outfits to get that back.
[129:01.89]Okay.
[129:03.61]Now change outfits again.
[129:15.29]Okay.
[129:16.81]There it is.
[129:21.90]Now we got Uncle Poe.
[129:23.48]Let's go do Uncle Poe's mission.
[129:27.16]Who?
[129:27.28]Oh, you.
[129:28.38]I need face 8 to do the suit anyways.
[129:30.76]Yeah, I'm not even there.
[129:31.50]I'm not even close, man.
[129:33.64]Find the payphone.
[129:54.01]Um, I... I wanna buy a car.
[129:59.63]Why did I buy this?
[130:00.47]I needed a new car.
[130:03.68]I'm gonna have to drive around with a joke car.
[130:06.76]Can I steal the sword?
[130:09.94]Good.
[130:10.26]Just making sure I still have it.
[130:11.98]You know those games can be weird sometimes.
[130:22.78]Yeah, that was every cent I've made.
[130:25.72]One thing I will tell you, though, is the sword during missions, where I have to fight people, like, you can just carve them up.
[130:38.61]Yakuza skin.
[130:40.91]Well, I want to do the interesting ones first.
[130:45.03]Bug the payphone.
[130:46.09]Sure.
[130:49.37]Just do this in broad daylight.
[130:50.56]That's fine.
[130:54.73]Nobody pay attention to this guy.
[131:04.45]Double it up.
[131:08.39]Come on.
[131:09.73]Come on.
[131:16.85]I got the sword.
[131:17.35]I still have the sword.
[131:18.05]It didn't fall.
[131:21.82]A few hours later.
[131:30.86]I was gonna listen to the conversation You know I am I can't wait to see you again How about tonight?
[131:44.61]I can't baby.
[131:46.26]I have to work late.
[131:47.98]You sure?
[131:48.52]I love to baby.
[131:51.40]You know, I can't wait to taste you again talking to me
[131:59.20]Is this one of my other many girlfriends?
[132:00.72]My sword.
[132:01.94]Sword.
[132:02.24]Oh, fucking hell.
[132:08.22]Level 4, a lackey will bring you your car anytime, anywhere.
[132:30.52]That's cool.
[132:31.96]That's very helpful, actually.
[132:33.38]Where's my sword?
[132:34.24]That, well, what a good $350,000 shoulder pad I bought.
[132:36.22]Give me my car.
[132:54.91]Which car is it?
[132:55.71]That's not my car.
[132:57.28]Oh, there it is.
[133:17.72]Was this the car?
[133:19.34]No!
[133:20.24]My car was already here!
[133:46.41]Oh my god.
[133:47.78]That's not a car.
[133:50.34]Wait a minute, can I call him again?
[133:51.66]Oh fuck, did he die?
[133:53.82]No, I don't think he died.
[133:56.19]Did he?
[133:56.97]What is that?
[133:57.47]That thing has a marker on it.
[133:58.93]Oh, should I need that thing?
[134:13.49]I love this game.
[134:14.89]Alright, fuck off.
[134:16.30]I need to go steal more of these.
[134:17.44]Where is it?
[134:20.90]Ugh.
[134:25.08]Alright, let me try this again.
[134:26.28]I just unlocked it and I instantly lose the damn thing.
[134:31.18]Alright, here we go.
[134:33.82]Okay, I need a car.
[134:38.63]Hey, it's Wei.
[134:40.31]I need a car.
[134:40.87]A car?
[134:43.38]I'll be there right away.
[134:44.96]Thank you.
[134:54.08]Where the fuck am I?
[134:58.62]What about my car?
[134:59.98]Hey, it's Wei.
[135:06.88]I need a car.
[135:08.20]A car?
[135:09.92]I'll be there right away.
[135:11.60]Thank you.
[135:17.26]There he is.
[135:23.37]He just crashed.
[135:29.17]Is that him?
[135:29.67]He's kinda scaring the shit out of me.
[135:33.51]What does this guy want?
[135:35.09]What do you want from me?
[135:37.73]Stop fucking getting this close.
[135:39.17]What is it?
[135:39.59]Oh, he brought the bike.
[135:44.66]Okay.
[135:44.82]He crashed it over here somewhere.
[135:46.90]I'm just going to try to call him again.
[135:49.84]There it is.
[136:12.98]I want to call.
[136:13.46]I wish he... It'd be so funny if I could just keep calling him and he keeps bringing bikes.
[136:17.33]And he brings like 30 of them.
[136:23.75]That's unfortunate.
[136:24.49]Okay, let's... Let's go to Uncle Poe.
[136:30.50]The car's gonna blow up.
[136:32.74]That would be unfortunate.
[136:42.69]Down here.
[136:44.89]Right here.
[136:48.70]A car?
[136:50.14]No.
[136:51.06]There must be a cool-down period.
[137:01.16]A car?
[137:02.56]I'll be there soon.
[137:04.56]Oh.
[137:12.23]That guy's great.
[137:12.91]I can't wait to call that guy in the middle of a firefight.
[137:15.65]It's gonna be so much fun.
[137:17.74]Looks like you're gonna meet Uncle Poe.
[137:20.48]The rest of you, wait here.
[137:21.72]Don't do anything until you hear from me.
[137:25.32]What's going on?
[137:27.26]It's not even funny having this character.
[137:30.88]And you are shutting the fuck up!
[137:33.46]Got it?
[137:33.62]Of course.
[137:33.92]Good.
[137:38.94]Those guys have the same chains, the same... Why does everybody wear the same shirt?
[137:42.93]Everyone wears the same... tank top.
[137:50.63]I would spray-paint a bunch of shit off my tank top.
[137:52.47]Don't worry.
[137:55.50]You pissed off the wrong people, Wade.
[137:57.84]Look, at least we kept Siwa alive.
[138:00.12]Yeah.
[138:01.27]Uncle Poe!
[138:01.67]We're looking for you.
[138:03.75]The driving has become more fun in this game.
[138:06.55]When is GTA 6 going to come out?
[138:08.68]That's what I want to see.
[138:31.90]Oh, the dumb cops pretending to take pictures down there is still there Feels like eight years
[138:54.09]Look out for fucking Peggy 16.
[138:55.09]Big kill up.
[138:56.35]Okay Winston.
[139:23.00]Big speech.
[139:25.02]Because it's your side.
[139:26.34]No, that was my side.
[139:30.22]That's where he gets the balls to come after me.
[139:31.89]That was my side.
[139:33.15]Along with drugs, he's into prostitution, porn.
[139:37.91]He even sells women across the border into the rest of Asia.
[139:40.21]The whole thing is run like an industry.
[139:43.52]Very sleazy, but big money.
[139:46.30]Winston, we can't just walk in there.
[139:48.70]Not if it's as bad as you say.
[139:51.45]I have a lot of choice.
[139:53.49]It's the way it's done, Wade.
[139:54.65]Besides, you can't hide from Uncle Poe.
[139:56.49]If he wants you dead, you're dead.
[139:59.81]And I'd rather see it come, you know?
[140:01.57]You should be okay.
[140:03.39]But if I get my ass shot, do not do anything stupid, you hear me?
[140:09.48]Okay.
[140:12.54]You know I'm gonna try it in there, right?
[140:14.22]Hey, Winston.
[140:19.38]What's wrong?
[140:19.82]You look a little pale, man.
[140:21.70]Do I have my sword back?
[140:47.39]I call him in here.
[140:48.03]He drives the bike into this house.
[140:55.11]And you, young man, must be way.
[140:57.91]Winston speaks very highly of you.
[141:00.50]Winston has been a good friend to me.
[141:02.98]I've tried to do right by him.
[141:04.98]I like the way you think.
[141:06.84]That's the attitude that makes us... You look so stupid, Flea.
[141:09.96]Loyalty.
[141:11.33]Discretion.
[141:13.39]Used to be more common.
[141:14.99]No.
[141:16.15]I'm going to use this for at least 30 more minutes.
[141:17.69]Winston says you're the one who made sure Siwa was not arrested.
[141:23.52]No, it was Winston's idea.
[141:24.98]He had to assert himself, assert his position.
[141:28.46]But he didn't want to inconvenience you in the process.
[141:34.16]Did he now?
[141:37.28]In any case, you did well.
[141:39.82]I want to show you my gratitude.
[141:42.87]Uncle, there's really no need... Don't argue with me.
[141:47.73]Do you know Roland Hull?
[141:50.19]He has a business collecting debts.
[141:53.35]The other day he told me that he could use some help.
[141:56.53]Famous actor, yeah.
[141:57.36]It's quite lucrative, you know.
[142:00.80]Tell him I sent you.
[142:02.54]Winston won't mind in the slightest.
[142:05.66]Will you?
[142:09.09]Thank you, Uncle.
[142:12.07]Time to lay down some justice.
[142:13.10]Is he going down?
[142:13.88]This looks like a guy going down.
[142:16.38]No?
[142:34.84]I like that jacket.
[142:35.97]I like that jacket.
[142:36.95]I want one of those.
[143:03.74]Take the car across the street.
[143:04.96]Give you a chance to see what it's like to be in the big time.
[143:07.94]God dammit, I wanna call my only friend.
[143:12.98]I like that guy more than anybody else in the whole game so far.
[143:24.24]Wow, he's super powered.
[143:25.92]He's got force fields and shit.
[143:29.38]Okay, I'm scared of this guy now.
[143:31.16]I'm sorry, sir.
[143:32.36]I'll do the mission now.
[143:34.25]Forget I did anything.
[143:43.39]Yeah, you alright?
[143:46.21]I'm fucking with that guy.
[143:47.27]I always am.
[143:48.09]I'm gonna play this game too much, then I'm gonna have trouble driving a real car.
[143:56.58]On the right side of the road.
[144:08.07]Sword?
[144:10.33]No, I don't have a sword.
[144:11.44]I just look like a fucking warrior.
[144:14.08]I don't... This just really is a $350,000 shoulder pad.
[144:19.90]It really is.
[144:21.41]The sword makes the outfit.
[144:24.45]There's a saw blade right there.
[144:25.93]No, that's a gun.
[144:30.38]Ah, why?
[144:31.12]You got friends in high places, my boy.
[144:33.73]I hear you and Winston have been making trouble with Dog Eyes.
[144:36.67]Dog Eyes has been asking for trouble.
[144:39.53]I remember when I was like you, always looking for a fight, ready to kill anyone who so much as looked at me sideways.
[144:47.76]Hold down the D-pad.
[144:48.66]No, it doesn't work.
[144:50.16]Do I get the gun?
[144:50.88]He's sitting next to a gun.
[144:52.87]You keep choosing the worst outfits?
[144:54.81]This was a democracy!
[145:17.44]This is voted for.
[145:19.10]The people voted for this one.
[145:25.38]I had nothing to do with this decision.
[145:30.35]Well, that's why you always turn around and look.
[145:33.93]Go back to the Oscar.
[145:38.58]Baseball cap.
[145:46.86]Okay.
[145:54.73]Couple of broken hands, not a big deal.
[145:56.13]Alright.
[145:57.85]Let's go.
[146:01.23]Why am I using a controller?
[146:02.29]Because it's easier to drive in these games with a controller.
[146:05.35]Using keyboard and mouse to drive in any game like this is painful for me.
[146:10.90]Using WASD?
[146:11.24]No, no, no, no.
[146:11.72]Analog is much easier.
[146:12.74]I think that lady got her head stuck in the banister.
[146:41.38]She's with him.
[146:41.92]I thought she was scared of him Hold LB to aim while driving
[147:16.28]Uh, I'm behind you.
[147:16.98]Get outta here.
[147:22.25]Oh, that was perfect.
[147:59.99]Yep.
[148:04.81]Woo!
[148:04.95]I'm running out of ammo here.
[148:11.30]Chewbacca.
[148:24.30]Come on.
[148:34.53]Oh, what the fuck?
[148:36.27]Why was that indestructible?
[148:39.17]That was indestructible.
[148:40.58]That was a dead stop.
[148:50.22]Gonna hijack the car.
[148:54.47]Yeah, we know how this one works.
[149:08.53]Green, baby, green!
[149:18.84]I haven't done anything!
[149:20.04]That's the problem.
[149:21.20]You old guy like rolling home money, you gotta pay.
[149:23.76]I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
[149:25.36]I don't care if you're sorry.
[149:27.22]I care if you have the money.
[149:28.98]I don't, I'm sorry!
[149:29.98]Wow, that's to the point.
[149:31.24]Hey, stop saying that.
[149:33.44]I'm sorry!
[149:34.82]Look.
[149:35.24]The car.
[149:36.45]Who has drugged in the back?
[149:38.45]That should cover my debt.
[149:39.75]You're not pretty, David.
[149:40.79]I'm sorry!
[149:42.11]Whoa!
[149:42.67]Huh?
[149:45.53]Huh?
[149:46.03]I wasn't gonna do anything to that.
[149:50.49]She's alive.
[149:51.53]Where the fuck did she go?
[149:53.63]She disappeared.
[149:54.19]Yeah, she disappeared.
[150:18.83]Oh no, what's with the Harry Potter sandwich car?
[150:22.57]Wait, can I drive the Harry Potter sandwich car?
[150:24.87]I still have the gun, right?
[150:30.46]No, I don't.
[150:35.52]Why do I not have the gun?
[150:36.34]Apparently not.
[150:50.93]this is not good I can't get back in the car I have to move this car with another car okay I can fix this I need another car to move this one every time walk on one side of the street they appear walk on the other side of the street they go the other way
[151:23.92]There we go.
[151:24.82]Okay, stop.
[151:32.64]Just gonna bump it a little.
[151:35.31]Okay.
[151:36.49]Somebody take a... This guy taking a selfie?
[151:53.88]I guess.
[151:57.76]Everybody smile!
[151:59.04]Alright, that should be good.
[152:01.46]Alright, have we freed it?
[152:02.12]Did we complete the puzzle?
[152:03.76]Yes, we did.
[152:14.06]Everybody smile!
[152:15.20]Let's snap a pic.
[152:27.02]That'll never get old.
[152:28.40]It really won't.
[152:29.50]I'm sorry.
[152:40.23]Hello.
[152:45.07]Why the hell wouldn't they add that to GTA?
[152:47.91]There's so many opportunities for that to be hysterical in Grand Theft Auto.
[152:51.72]It's perfect.
[152:54.84]Okay, I can do debt collecting jobs, high roller outfit, new apartment.
[153:02.17]We need to meet right away.
[153:03.07]Yeah, I didn't get any good boy points.
[153:13.69]Raymond.
[153:15.63]Shen.
[153:16.64]Finally.
[153:17.96]Where the hell have you been?
[153:19.71]Look, I, uh... Do you have any idea what's going on?
[153:21.47]What happened at the warehouse?
[153:22.25]Raymond, do you ever actually read my reports?
[153:24.47]Your reports?
[153:25.99]You make those?
[153:26.41]All I have to do is read the goddamn newspapers.
[153:28.19]They're calling it a massacre.
[153:29.85]If it ever came out that the police were involved, we're dead.
[153:32.22]It won't.
[153:33.06]Whoa, you can't know that.
[153:35.26]You at least, you at least could have turned Siwa over to us.
[153:38.02]It would have helped our case.
[153:39.24]And we'd have put the entire operation at risk.
[153:43.02]What does Pendrew say?
[153:44.76]You know, he's not your handle, Wade.
[153:46.48]I am.
[153:46.70]Well, then fucking handle it, Raymond.
[153:48.34]Well, how'd you think this was gonna go down?
[153:49.54]Remember this being a solid game?
[153:50.58]It is.
[153:51.38]Whatever it takes.
[153:52.22]You remember that?
[153:52.92]It's pretty solid.
[153:54.54]And you can't get them sitting behind a desk, nose in a rule book, with a stick up your ass.
[154:00.49]Look, Raymond.
[154:01.67]I am doing what needs to be done.
[154:03.79]No.
[154:04.35]No, you've crossed the line, Wade.
[154:06.09]I'm gonna terminate this operation.
[154:08.68]You can't do that.
[154:09.78]Pendrew won't allow it.
[154:10.76]Pendrew may like to take chances.
[154:12.56]I don't.
[154:13.54]And you are dangerous.
[154:14.56]You got a dirty fucking briefcase, buddy.
[154:16.90]You are not one to point fingers about anything.
[154:18.62]That is disgusting.
[154:19.82]Pull the plug.
[154:20.58]Go ahead and tell Pendrew that I just met the chairman of the Sun On Yee.
[154:24.65]The chairman?
[154:27.53]Wait, you're just a foot soldier.
[154:29.35]Well, this foot soldier has just been marked for promotion.
[154:32.17]Because I made sure Suwa got out safely.
[154:35.05]It'll be in my report.
[154:36.35]And maybe this time you'll actually read it.
[154:41.82]He turns around, dings a quarter with his thumb.
[154:45.64]Get that fucking briefcase.
[154:47.36]I fucked it up!
[154:59.17]Oh well.
[155:04.48]That's when you do like a cut.
[155:05.60]Look, the best actors in the world need more than one or two takes.
[155:09.65]You know how many takes Brad Pitt... You know how long it took Brad Pitt to do the speech in Oceans 12?
[155:17.61]It was like four hours.
[155:18.67]Give me a break.
[155:20.29]This is live.
[155:20.99]This is live TV.
[155:21.97]This is my new apartment.
[155:26.71]It's pretty nice.
[155:27.85]Can I take a bath?
[155:28.91]This is really nice.
[155:29.83]Look at this.
[155:36.28]Okay, desktop PC.
[155:38.68]Painting of a random city.
[155:41.70]So you know you made it.
[155:42.80]Anytime you go into somebody's house and they have a picture or a painting of a city, that means that they make probably at least $200,000 to $300,000 a year.
[155:51.64]Can I cook food?
[155:52.12]I want to take a bath.
[156:06.90]You can't put a bathroom in that.
[156:07.88]Let me use it.
[156:16.12]This place sucks.
[156:18.78]I want my sword back.
[156:22.68]I'll get it.
[156:23.08]Okay.
[156:31.75]Now give it to me.
[156:36.05]What is a custom outfit?
[156:39.47]No, I guess I can... Absorbs 50% of damage.
[156:45.19]That's kind of insane.
[156:47.91]CSI uniform.
[156:49.29]Double cop XP earned, but no triad experience.
[156:52.93]High roller.
[156:53.37]Win or lose, you look great.
[156:54.39]That looks great.
[156:56.35]I would wear that.
[156:59.68]Sword.
[157:00.14]Got it.
[157:14.76]Let it calm down for a minute.
[157:16.04]Let it die down for a second.
[157:25.04]Okay.
[157:28.44]Wow, that's an interesting painting.
[157:32.86]The artist really was representing something here.
[157:35.65]Chaos.
[157:37.23]Harshness.
[157:38.99]Have you seen this painting?
[157:40.61]Let me give you a fucking closer look.
[157:45.69]Needed to add something to it though.
[157:49.70]Thanks for being my inspiration.
[157:53.66]I'm putting on the high roller outfit.
[157:55.20]This thing's done.
[157:56.94]This thing's going to the trash.
[157:57.84]I don't want to wear this anymore.
[158:02.34]Fuck the lightning sword.
[158:05.72]Putting on the high roller outfit.
[158:09.67]Look fucking cool, you know what I'm saying?
[158:15.34]Until we get a better outfit.
[158:19.70]Let me be normal for one couple missions or two.
[158:23.22]You guys thought it was gonna happen.
[158:25.42]Not that much of a psycho.
[158:51.58]You two together?
[158:57.23]Wearing the same exact clothes.
[159:00.73]This place is pretty nice though.
[159:01.83]I like this place.
[159:12.60]She crawls up into a sofa ball.
[159:15.40]I just wanted to break through the glass and be cool.
[159:19.61]I just want to break through the glass and do an action sequence.
[159:22.73]Whatever.
[159:23.13]Let's do a favor for somebody.
[159:30.13]We got plenty of missions here now.
[159:38.14]Yeah, they get to look good doing it.
[159:40.86]Oh, is this fucking guy again?
[159:42.52]Fine.
[159:42.62]Let's go.
[159:53.47]Whoa.
[159:54.73]Okay, um, yep.
[159:56.57]What was the point of that?
[159:57.51]I want us to both be outside the car.
[159:59.79]Is he dead?
[160:00.55]No.
[160:27.75]I swear to God, I gotta stop doing that to people.
[160:32.69]They'll never catch us over here.
[160:39.92]Take aim, buddy.
[160:40.62]Straight ahead.
[160:45.34]Straight ahead, straight ahead, straight ahead, straight ahead.
[160:46.72]Right here, right here.
[160:49.83]No, he's still right behind me.
[160:51.83]Dick.
[160:52.35]Give me a gun, too.
[160:54.31]Let's see what's here.
[161:06.38]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[161:07.98]Here we go.
[161:11.50]In three.
[161:13.68]Two.
[161:13.92]No, I can go this way.
[161:14.88]Okay.
[161:20.24]They're not going to come down here.
[161:25.41]This is so awkward for them to get down here.
[161:34.83]We're good.
[161:38.51]I was really hoping he was going to jump into the water.
[161:41.55]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[161:52.23]I really thought he was going to jump in the water.
[162:06.00]Why do they do that?
[162:06.72]They just disappear.
[162:11.62]There are bad guys right here.
[162:15.01]So let's get a good angle.
[162:17.89]I wish I could move the camera and not have to worry about facing backwards.
[162:23.49]Oh my god, there is no way down!
[162:25.51]I am just realizing right now, there is in fact no... I thought this was... I thought it went down in a slope on stairs.
[162:35.31]I did not realize that's what this was.
[162:36.91]Okay, so I'm holding the brake now.
[162:38.77]I have to get out of the car.
[162:39.83]I'm in a lot of trouble.
[162:49.40]I'm spinning the tires.
[162:50.46]I can't do anything.
[163:03.15]Hey, this way.
[163:04.88]I need a car.
[163:05.96]Sorry, I don't have any time.
[163:07.94]Hey, this way.
[163:15.75]I need a car.
[163:16.87]Sorry, I don't have any time.
[163:18.53]You're going to leave me high and dry.
[163:20.28]Leave me high and dry.
[163:42.67]Remember me?
[163:45.91]How the fuck are ya?
[163:58.06]Get up.
[163:59.44]Alright, tell me everything you know about the fucking secret society.
[164:11.10]Uh-oh.
[164:13.02]Uh-oh!
[164:13.40]Somebody's in trouble!
[164:16.04]Somebody's in trouble.
[164:17.36]Somebody just got lifted up.
[164:20.70]Like Magneto showed up and held this guy in the air.
[164:32.97]His worst fear realized.
[164:47.18]Fuck both of you.
[164:47.88]Alright.
[164:52.40]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[164:52.90]Beer bottle?
[164:54.54]I can drink beer?
[164:56.40]Ooh!
[164:59.95]I can throw this at somebody too.
[165:01.83]Okay, so now we're gonna go to Water Street.
[165:10.27]Bride to be a fine... This one sounds interesting.
[165:14.01]I want to do this one.
[165:17.09]I'm not sure what this person is.
[165:19.69]But I can talk to them.
[165:22.17]See what they do.
[165:25.23]Sofa set.
[165:25.85]$14,000 for a sofa.
[165:28.73]Did I just do that?
[165:29.40]Oh no, I just spent $14,000.
[165:31.18]No, I didn't.
[165:41.11]Okay.
[165:51.28]Thanks for the sofa.
[165:57.92]No, you didn't.
[165:58.34]No, no.
[166:00.00]I decided to do it.
[166:03.97]I decided I wanted to do it.
[166:06.95]It's an Easter egg.
[166:08.47]I'm going to do all the Easter eggs.
[166:13.90]Let's bottle somebody and do the next mission.
[166:25.36]I wish I could have unlimited bottles.
[166:34.98]That was such awful aim.
[166:36.30]I am so...
[166:46.67]Hooray!
[166:46.81]He likes us again.
[166:48.44]There he is.
[167:10.97]I'm just pushing him.
[167:12.57]Oh man.
[167:13.11]We're going fast.
[167:14.93]Oh boy.
[167:15.67]Oh boy.
[167:21.73]Is he alright?
[167:22.37]Is he alright?
[167:22.91]Give me my bike.
[167:29.27]He doesn't understand.
[167:40.16]Hey, there it is.
[167:40.88]I hope this is good enough.
[167:42.82]Thanks.
[167:43.04]Thanks, buddy.
[167:46.04]Appreciate it.
[167:48.01]I can always count on you.
[168:06.85]I got a helmet, yeah.
[168:09.03]I didn't realize that.
[168:14.25]First time I've ever had a helmet.
[168:23.99]Using my pogo stick.
[168:25.06]What the fuck is that?
[168:29.80]Follow Tiffany?
[168:30.68]Oh no.
[168:39.99]Huh?
[168:40.29]What happened?
[168:40.95]I heard a scream
[169:13.43]Oh, it's this guy again.
[169:14.57]I don't want to fucking do anything with this dude.
[169:17.95]I hate this guy.
[169:18.75]Quick, do the thing.
[169:22.15]Wait.
[169:22.25]Well, let's take this better bike.
[169:23.71]It'll never not be funny.
[169:24.73]Hold on.
[169:24.95]Sir?
[169:45.36]sir oh no okay I'm fine I can't help doing this it's too much fun
[170:17.18]I got my helmet on.
[170:21.91]Too fast.
[170:23.03]No, don't take it off!
[170:23.97]Put the helmet back on!
[170:26.11]Hey, it's alright, I got another one.
[170:39.94]What's the SpongeBob thing when it goes like... A few... No.
[170:54.20]Suspicious!
[170:57.60]Follow the rules of the road.
[171:02.10]Why is she getting suspicious of me?
[171:04.76]She's the one that's crashing the fucking car.
[171:07.67]Over and over again.
[171:08.73]Yet I'm the suspicious one.
[171:12.51]Very suspicious of me.
[171:14.11]For you to get in a bunch of car accidents.
[171:31.12]She's driving like a maniac.
[171:32.76]That's not my problem.
[171:39.35]She's driving into people.
[171:47.27]She's running people over.
[171:48.02]Where are you going?
[172:03.56]Lady.
[172:04.70]It's kind of a wild goose chase.
[172:14.38]No, I didn't fail it, did I?
[172:15.70]Thank God.
[172:20.92]Say something funny, what are you talking about?
[172:24.06]Take a picture, right?
[172:29.12]No, no picture.
[172:32.06]Hey, what the hell you think you're doing?
[172:33.62]Who are you?
[172:38.88]Wait a second, motherfucker.
[172:43.81]Who are you?
[172:45.25]So the big triad gangster is mad now?
[172:47.77]That was an entrance.
[172:48.43]Only the big triad gangster can sleep with other people?
[172:50.71]Whoa, triads?
[172:53.07]I'll see you later.
[172:54.41]Who is this not-ping person?
[172:56.41]You think you can fool around on me and I don't care?
[172:58.71]What?
[172:59.02]She didn't mean anything to me.
[173:00.34]I was just part of work.
[173:02.51]What's happening right now?
[173:04.25]You think you can go around jumping into other girls whenever you feel like it?
[173:07.81]Well, what's good for Yang is good for Yin.
[173:09.97]Okay, okay.
[173:10.89]I'm sorry, alright?
[173:12.56]I never meant for you to get hurt.
[173:14.94]Some excuse.
[173:16.62]So you're gonna dump her now?
[173:18.28]Stay loyal to me?
[173:19.26]I turned into a bird.
[173:20.22]Or do I have to go find another man to keep you warm?
[173:22.82]Let me see what I can do.
[173:23.97]You know, I thought you were different.
[173:25.99]I guess not.
[173:27.03]Goodbye.
[173:53.89]Fuck!
[173:55.03]They always get away!
[174:11.00]Give me your helmet.
[174:12.60]Oh god, David.
[174:14.52]We both got helmets on.
[174:17.98]Let's think about this.
[174:22.87]Get on it.
[174:29.83]Hey!
[174:31.93]Wait, I gotta get another helmet.
[174:35.25]No, not that one.
[174:38.53]A different one!
[174:39.95]Alright, Bride to be.
[174:45.50]That's what we're about.
[174:46.18]You just have unlimited health.
[175:06.10]I like this bike though.
[175:07.08]It's got very fluid handling.
[175:09.34]Three, two, one.
[175:10.14]Time it.
[175:10.72]Nice work.
[175:28.11]Yeah, you mentioned the helmet.
[175:29.37]Congratulations.
[175:30.25]So we're doing wedding stuff.
[175:31.65]No problem at all, Mrs. Chu.
[175:58.52]I thought that was a person lying down with the head cut off.
[176:03.69]I was like, what the hell is that?
[176:05.00]And I was like, oh, it's a chicken.
[176:07.48]I was gonna say, I bet you that smells really good in this room.
[176:14.11]Hello, Wei.
[176:15.17]Thanks for driving me around.
[176:16.29]New woman of interest.
[176:17.67]So, where are we going?
[176:18.79]The flower shop.
[176:19.99]I still have to pick the color I want.
[176:21.95]He won't believe how much work it is to get ready for a wedding.
[176:25.26]We've been planning for eight months now, and there's still so much to be done.
[176:28.88]I'm sure it'll be fine.
[176:30.52]It better be perfect.
[176:32.18]My wedding has to be perfect.
[176:34.20]Say something funny.
[176:35.42]What are you talking about?
[176:36.54]Is she in the car?
[176:39.03]Peggy's mood.
[176:39.87]Drive Peggy to the bridal shop.
[176:42.28]She isn't.
[176:42.64]Okay, we gotta make sure she stays happy.
[176:48.29]No.
[176:49.09]My life, it wouldn't be a good idea right now.
[176:51.52]Your life is why it be good.
[176:54.12]You have to have someone you can be soft with, too.
[176:56.92]Be careful.
[176:59.20]On my wedding day.
[177:00.28]One day you'll forget how to be soft.
[177:01.98]On my day.
[177:03.38]My father's wedding.
[177:05.45]If you say so.
[177:06.45]I do say so.
[177:08.05]You are family now, Wei.
[177:09.43]I have to look out for you, just like Winston.
[177:12.29]After the wedding, I'm going to find someone for you.
[177:14.81]How do you get on with Winston's mother?
[177:16.21]That sounds like a good idea.
[177:17.23]She's a hand... Wei!
[177:18.69]Wei!
[177:21.27]a baby looking to blow off a little steam sure why not let's see if we can make you feel better all over quick get back in the car I tried to run away I swear to god I tried to run away and it sucked me back in
[177:50.51]Peggy is not amused.
[177:51.35]Look, she's fine.
[177:51.93]It's building back up.
[177:53.25]Okay, no, I'm fucking wrong.
[178:18.73]I do say so.
[178:20.31]You are family now, eh?
[178:22.09]Really?
[178:22.39]I get in a fender bender and you get that upset and I kill two people and you don't get out of the car?
[178:27.03]So how do you get on with Winston's mother?
[178:29.15]Uh, she's a handful.
[178:31.50]But, you know, her bark is worse than your bite.
[178:34.38]You got a girlfriend?
[178:35.26]As he drives into oncoming traffic.
[178:38.00]That's worse than her bark for sure.
[178:40.10]No, she used to scare me, but then one day I was having a problem with Winston.
[178:45.06]He wasn't paying enough attention to me to distract me from her.
[178:53.00]Yeah, go on.
[178:54.12]Go on.
[178:56.23]No, don't get too far away.
[178:57.43]It won't be worth it.
[178:59.67]No, don't get too far away.
[179:01.07]I'm right here.
[179:02.01]I'm right here.
[179:02.61]I'm right here.
[179:03.21]I'm right here.
[179:04.14]I'm right here, Peggy.
[179:05.62]Peggy!
[179:06.02]Okay.
[179:06.94]Drive the car!
[179:12.56]Okay, we're fine, Peggy.
[179:13.30]Nice.
[179:13.72]Well, you're lucky.
[179:14.84]My mother never liked my girlfriends.
[179:16.58]I guess it's hard for the moms.
[179:18.00]Well, I mean, you know, I used to have a thing for blondes, too, and that drove her crazy.
[179:22.13]Bad enough if I went out with a Chinese-American girl, but a whitey?
[179:26.39]Well, it's good to know she was loyal to her people.
[179:29.27]No, she's loyal to her prejudices more like.
[179:31.85]That, too?
[179:33.05]Saved.
[179:36.41]That'll be a killer fight.
[179:45.96]I'm actually surprised that I would have been... So many people would have been so mad at me for that.
[179:50.36]Let me just pick the conversation back up like nothing ever happened.
[179:59.33]I mean, I know you just dove out of the car and climbed in a chicken wagon, but... Let me keep talking about how you need a girlfriend.
[180:14.12]Alright, so we're going to like the bridal shop or something, right?
[180:17.14]I'm gonna end up walking around the bridal shop.
[180:19.15]I'm gonna take some photos.
[180:22.63]What cake do you want?
[180:27.83]Okay.
[180:42.31]Odd flash?
[180:42.53]What?
[180:42.67]Here comes the bridezilla.
[181:10.50]Yes, but they're not for sale.
[181:13.83]The other day the CEO of Oldboy Trading wanted one for his daughter.
[181:18.55]He told them they offered Temple $100,000.
[181:20.01]They still say no.
[181:23.39]It's incredible, no?
[181:25.03]I could just stay with them.
[181:26.57]That was a quick change.
[181:27.29]Got out of that wedding gown real quick.
[181:28.65]Afternoon, ma'am.
[181:43.95]Alright.
[181:44.77]Next, we need to pick up the wedding cake.
[181:47.07]So you got a cake picked out?
[181:48.18]Wait.
[181:48.48]Winston's in charge of that.
[181:50.26]He knows I'm very particular about cakes, but he promised I wouldn't be disappointed.
[181:54.18]Does she still have a mood?
[181:54.90]Because there are statues.
[181:56.28]I'm sure Winston will impress me.
[181:58.18]It's our wedding after all.
[181:59.28]Okay, here we go.
[181:59.80]I'm going to do this quick.
[182:00.52]And your wedding has to be perfect.
[182:02.40]Now your way!
[182:09.45]Thanks, lady.
[182:18.97]Running around.
[182:19.73]Just sprinting in instead.
[182:21.23]Wait, there's a case there too.
[182:29.21]She can wait.
[182:29.79]I don't have a mood meter anymore.
[182:34.61]I need money.
[182:35.09]I gotta find more of those red envelopes.
[182:41.95]Yeah, we can learn to move.
[182:47.44]Emergency.
[182:48.02]Shop called.
[182:48.56]Someone is stealing our wedding cake.
[182:49.78]Must be that asshole, Dog Eyes.
[182:51.56]Stop the robbery.
[182:52.20]Oh, boy.
[182:52.42]Okay.
[182:52.56]Timed mission.
[182:53.16]Until Peggy pukes in my Uber.
[183:05.15]She started down a particular road and couldn't get off of it.
[183:08.69]My mother hoped that moving to San Francisco would shake her up, change who she hung out with, you know?
[183:13.96]Did it?
[183:14.52]Yeah, for a while.
[183:16.30]But some habits die hard, you know?
[183:18.68]Some don't die at all.
[183:19.90]I'm sorry, Wei.
[183:21.64]Winston mentioned that she passed away.
[183:23.98]I didn't mean to... Crazy taxi.
[183:26.04]It's okay, baby.
[183:26.74]You know, it's good to remember where you came from and where you're going.
[183:33.74]Uber doesn't pay extra for puke?
[183:35.22]What are you talking about?
[183:36.32]Yes, it does.
[183:36.76]It's like $150 if you puke in somebody's Uber.
[183:43.61]It's straight up.
[183:44.95]If you throw up in an Uber, it's $150.
[183:46.13]She gets it.
[184:09.40]Alright, that guy's... Alright.
[184:11.96]That's fun.
[184:13.16]That's fun.
[184:13.68]I feel like, you know what would be fun?
[184:14.66]Is to put a thousand of those on the ground and drive over them.
[184:19.34]It'd be like a bumper boat.
[184:23.74]It'd be like bumper cars on boats.
[184:30.32]I just puked.
[184:31.02]I get $150.
[184:31.24]No, no, no.
[184:31.48]You pay.
[184:31.76]You don't get $150 if you throw up.
[184:32.55]You pay $150 if you throw up.
[184:40.85]And I'm talking any puke at all.
[184:42.58]Any puke.
[184:44.32]Nope.
[184:44.94]You know... I thought he said gamer.
[184:48.04]You're a gamer.
[184:48.68]Do something.
[184:50.24]What the fuck am I doing?
[185:09.86]I got it!
[185:10.69]I got the cake!
[185:15.61]Yeah, if you... Even if you puke a tiny bit and it gets on that person's car, good luck.
[185:24.94]Get out of the road.
[185:27.50]Cars drive down here.
[185:28.46]Don't you know that?
[185:29.62]There's a party going on here.
[185:30.46]I want to look at it.
[185:36.29]I want to be in the picture.
[185:39.78]I can't get out of the car.
[185:40.60]Alright, I want the car to be in the picture.
[185:47.89]No, no, no, no, no!
[185:50.49]Fine.
[185:51.07]Fuck you guys.
[185:57.08]Nice party.
[186:08.60]I murdered someone for this cake?
[186:09.66]No, the lady didn't die.
[186:11.24]She's alive.
[186:14.73]Tell Winston I got the cake.
[186:15.73]Wow, that's great.
[186:16.61]I'll take it right to him.
[186:19.59]I wish you would, my son.
[186:21.23]Is that it?
[186:22.45]That was a long favor.
[186:23.87]All done.
[186:24.77]Thank you, Wei.
[186:25.49]This is a very long favor.
[186:26.66]Thank you.
[186:27.44]You know, it makes me think.
[186:30.14]Uh-oh.
[186:31.62]The wedding just won't be perfect without that orchid.
[186:35.26]Yep, there goes the steel orchids.
[186:36.64]I knew you'd understand.
[186:39.74]Orchid thief incoming.
[186:42.20]Bad people, bad person.
[186:44.15]Really hurt.
[186:54.24]It makes us a family, too.
[186:55.79]Yeah, I appreciate it.
[186:58.03]Man needs brothers, uncles, sisters, too.
[187:01.49]Help me with that soft side.
[187:03.39]Don't laugh.
[187:04.33]It's very important.
[187:05.69]You know, I could probably set you up.
[187:08.64]Set me up with somebody else.
[187:10.10]You're a good-looking man.
[187:12.90]I'm not looking for anything serious right now.
[187:15.24]I wouldn't want it to reflect poorly on you.
[187:17.72]Uh-huh.
[187:19.08]You're still playing around, huh?
[187:20.78]Well,
[187:21.92]I mean, she's not... She's not wrong.
[187:24.24]Neither am I. It's not made up.
[187:36.20]Get a rope from the shack.
[187:44.35]I have to... Okay.
[187:50.46]You tell me this is not suspicious?
[187:52.42]How am I... After hours don't raise suspicion, okay?
[187:58.91]We're getting on a new outfit.
[188:03.97]Fast talk past the monks to pick the orchid.
[188:11.54]Why would I do that when I can just parkour around the whole place?
[188:21.12]Monk over there, monk over here.
[188:22.26]We're gonna go around.
[188:23.90]Not gonna hurt anybody.
[188:24.56]He bought it!
[188:30.91]Where is it?
[188:33.29]No, not here.
[188:33.61]We're gonna go up and around.
[188:51.39]I love sprinting afterwards.
[188:52.95]Yeah, for wise monks, pretty unwise.
[188:54.65]Fight your way back to Peggy.
[189:21.99]I thought that... Wait, you guys are supposed to be non-violent.
[189:25.78]I'm non-violent too, so I'm not gonna do it.
[189:36.41]Violence begets violence, don't you understand?
[189:38.25]Ow.
[189:49.39]I'm not doing this the violent way.
[189:51.83]I'm going down the water slide.
[189:54.51]No, I'm not.
[189:58.31]I guess I am.
[189:59.47]They're not lying.
[189:59.95]I am.
[190:00.17]Out the front door.
[190:01.79]Non-violent.
[190:20.07]You got them?
[190:20.97]Drive the car.
[190:22.55]Thank you so much.
[190:24.09]How can I say no?
[190:24.89]We're just sitting in the parking lot.
[190:27.45]Hey, do you have any Winston's clothes in the back?
[190:29.97]I don't think these robes are going to make the right impression.
[190:32.07]What do you think about this?
[190:33.37]Yeah, sure.
[190:37.65]You cops, perfect.
[190:38.99]Hi-ya.
[190:39.31]That didn't... Wait, what is going on in the chat right now?
[190:47.46]Uh, Winston is not going to like this.
[190:52.09]Are we getting like mass timeouts right now?
[190:54.51]What happened?
[191:02.17]Chat is being killed right now.
[191:07.27]Oh, fuck.
[191:26.10]Do you have a gun?
[191:27.70]Can she shoot behind me?
[191:28.58]No.
[191:33.54]Well, that guy's having some time.
[191:37.82]That guy's having some time of his life.
[191:49.35]The whole opposite direction?
[191:50.59]Are you kidding me?
[191:56.69]This has been a long mission.
[192:00.28]This has been very long.
[192:02.08]We've been on the same mission for like 35 minutes.
[192:15.99]Thanks.
[192:16.57]That's the secret.
[192:18.01]You do what you have to do, but you always remember your family.
[192:21.92]Remember the people who love you.
[192:24.42]Then you'll always be happy.
[192:26.32]Can I get a... What is that?
[192:28.64]Can I get a... Is that me doing that?
[192:33.07]Less crowded?
[192:34.17]I guess.
[192:35.37]Do you like it better here or there?
[192:37.25]In some ways, I'm more comfortable there, but it wasn't home.
[192:42.84]It's important to have a
[192:44.92]Ooh, he got cut off there.
[192:51.15]Thanks for being so helpful, Wei.
[192:53.49]I really appreciate it.
[192:54.63]Of course.
[192:55.01]What is this?
[192:56.05]Sometimes this wedding thing stresses me out.
[192:58.81]There's so much to get right, and you only get one try.
[193:01.47]Don't worry, Peggy.
[193:02.93]It's gonna be perfect.
[193:04.21]Oh, it's so nice to find someone you can really rely on.
[193:07.41]I can see why Winston likes you.
[193:09.77]Can I get, uh, what is that?
[193:13.12]I don't know what that is.
[193:20.61]I apparently did that really poorly.
[193:25.51]Yeah, my outfit's gone.
[193:26.77]I got a monk outfit.
[193:30.53]Laundry.
[193:30.99]What have we got?
[193:34.83]There it is.
[193:37.91]No, you know what?
[193:38.39]I want a bike.
[193:38.81]You know how to get a bike?
[193:41.85]Where is he?
[193:50.58]Where is he?
[193:56.21]He just appeared.
[193:57.83]What a fucking murderer.
[194:02.63]I don't think this guy can be killed.
[194:05.29]No, he can just get seriously injured.
[194:12.25]He's unkillable.
[194:16.51]He cannot die.
[194:23.97]Wait, do they actually... The ambulance doesn't even care.
[194:37.68]The ambulance.
[194:38.96]Wait, pick him up.
[194:45.11]What the fuck is that?
[194:46.69]Alright, he'll be fine.
[194:48.69]Don't worry.
[194:54.33]No, I wish I could call him while he's dead.
[194:55.91]Alright.
[194:57.99]Statue.
[194:59.59]I'm gonna go this way because I don't want to go by the cop.
[195:08.95]Sneak in here, and bang him.
[195:19.23]Why are you showing the helmet joke from earlier?
[195:24.38]I found one of your statues.
[195:29.24]Tiger.
[195:45.62]Do a bike joke?
[195:47.92]No.
[195:48.02]How would he even do a bike joke?
[195:50.14]I'm so hungry now.
[195:51.01]What am I going to eat?
[196:12.68]Okay, spinning heel kick.
[196:13.78]Here we go.
[196:14.18]Spinning heel kick knocks down opponents.
[196:15.66]So this is X, X, hold, X. These are cool.
[196:22.50]Alright, spin point.
[196:23.60]Disarm the enemy.
[196:24.24]Let's get this.
[196:27.94]This is looking like it's going to be cool.
[196:30.88]Oh my gosh.
[196:31.92]Bang, bang, bang.
[196:34.94]Don't I already have that?
[196:39.62]This is just a stronger version of what I already have.
[196:47.60]It's just a more powered version of it.
[196:54.13]I'm trying to do my move!
[196:55.87]Stop showing off!
[197:03.91]This guy seriously, like, can I... Get the fuck out of here.
[197:11.62]I want to break that guy's neck.
[197:15.12]Trying to learn a move, and this guy is trying as hard as he can to beat me.
[197:26.39]I blocked your kick with my face.
[197:27.83]Very cool.
[197:32.95]Do I have any points to spend that aren't those?
[197:38.28]Nope.
[197:38.80]Nope.
[197:44.99]Extra special massagers.
[197:47.49]I'm having trouble saying words the last couple of days.
[197:49.66]Massages.
[197:51.72]I'm adding extra S's.
[197:52.96]Don't ask me why.
[197:54.34]Alright, I'm going to get a pork bun.
[197:57.22]Alright.
[197:59.02]That's a good idea, I think.
[198:04.46]Shoshosh.
[198:05.60]This Adam Sandler character.
[198:07.44]Oh.
[198:07.88]I'll take it.
[198:12.64]Shoshosh.
[198:14.15]Remember the Adam Sandler movie where he talks like that?
[198:23.55]Whoa!
[198:26.85]Psycho!
[198:35.07]What's next?
[198:35.69]We've got... What's the market for?
[198:41.91]There's a random quest over here.
[198:44.81]I want to give it a look.
[198:49.39]Bike joke.
[198:49.97]Fine.
[198:50.29]Here's your bike joke.
[198:55.57]Funny, huh?
[198:56.93]Whoa, that was funny.
[198:59.44]I'll try.
[198:59.74]I'll do it again for you.
[199:00.52]Ready?
[199:05.17]That was actually kind of cool.
[199:16.20]He's getting angry.
[199:20.06]I'm not getting angry.
[199:30.30]I heard that from another room.
[199:32.48]I heard that from another room, is what somebody said.
[199:34.90]Alright, what is going on?
[199:37.22]What is down here?
[199:38.05]Why?
[199:38.43]Who's in here?
[199:41.07]What's the problem here?
[199:49.95]What is this?
[199:51.69]Defeat the monks.
[199:54.20]Okay.
[199:54.86]Ooh, alright.
[199:55.50]Sounds like a plan.
[199:59.43]Alright, dude.
[200:02.21]Okay.
[200:20.18]Into the hot pot.
[200:23.52]They do counters as well, don't they?
[200:29.90]And... Gong.
[200:40.36]More monks.
[200:45.02]Oh, really?
[200:45.54]Now the monks are actually pretty good.
[200:56.27]I need to just concentrate.
[201:15.67]Nice!
[201:16.61]That was pretty sick.
[201:17.46]That was a great counter.
[201:47.95]Alright, I figured out the monks.
[201:48.99]I figured out the trick to the monks.
[201:56.80]The monks need to be countered.
[202:01.42]Are they down here?
[202:02.06]What the hell are you guys doing?
[202:05.64]I think you're gonna jump up here or what?
[202:10.13]Why are you down here?
[202:11.29]What the fuck is this?
[202:28.63]Come on, you know you want to.
[202:29.47]In the face.
[202:41.85]Whoa, I didn't block it.
[202:53.47]He's done?
[202:54.49]He's done.
[202:55.49]Get down here.
[203:06.64]Two more, and that's it.
[203:10.41]One more, actually.
[203:11.25]Is this... Is this King Monk?
[203:18.89]Whoa.
[203:20.93]Okay.
[203:22.52]Alright.
[203:26.68]Ah!
[203:33.82]Oh!
[203:34.48]That's all the Agent Smiths.
[204:03.19]CPU is working really hard now, that's true.
[204:17.90]Throw him at everybody.
[204:28.65]Fuck out.
[204:38.01]Monk bowling.
[204:40.16]And into the ass.
[204:53.17]Did I grow a mustache?
[204:55.02]Last guy.
[204:55.44]What are we gonna do with him?
[205:01.06]Over here.
[205:02.94]Brown him.
[205:08.94]Why am I killing monks?
[205:11.70]Seems really, really not cool.
[205:17.88]Oh, there it is.
[205:20.55]That's a lot of experience.
[205:23.35]I'll get the Shaolin Warrior outfit and Wing Chun decoration in your apartment.
[205:29.90]Sayonara.
[205:36.35]So now we got Water Street.
[205:38.39]Find this.
[205:38.99]Alright, we can do Water Street.
[205:41.85]Let me just take this.
[205:42.43]I'll be right back.
[205:47.04]Two minutes.
[205:54.37]See you in a minute.
[208:08.65]Man, I'm getting hungry.
[208:09.35]Alright, back to it.
[208:15.32]Let's see where we are in like an hour or so.
[208:18.24]Another like 30-40 minutes to see where we are.
[208:19.78]Another hour.
[208:29.66]Move this, move that.
[208:41.16]There.
[208:41.74]Okay.
[208:43.98]Okay.
[208:44.94]Hey, how you guys doing?
[208:46.80]It's been a while.
[208:48.76]How are you?
[208:49.24]Good to see you again.
[208:52.10]Hydrate.
[208:52.64]I already did.
[208:53.53]Add some water upstairs.
[208:57.49]Let's go to the new case.
[208:59.35]Give me this.
[209:10.71]I think it might be a little too loud.
[209:12.57]Let me just drop it a little bit.
[209:20.94]Take the motorcycle?
[209:21.64]Oh, sure.
[209:24.08]Hey, this way.
[209:25.80]I need a car.
[209:27.12]A car?
[209:28.64]I'll be there right away.
[209:35.10]Thanks.
[209:44.70]Thank you!
[209:46.74]You're a good man!
[209:50.27]Disappeared 3, 2, 1.
[209:50.91]No, he's there.
[209:54.89]That looked intentional, but it was not.
[210:03.78]Give me the energy drink.
[210:06.60]Hey.
[210:10.14]I will take your finest energy drinks.
[210:16.22]Thank you.
[210:16.63]Just get it all.
[210:18.25]Just load up on increased damage and shit.
[210:27.29]Can I get in there?
[210:46.11]I can that's a lot of blood that is so much blood it was a ketchup packet almost there we're close
[211:19.85]What, did I steal something?
[211:20.96]Oh, I thought that was... Okay.
[211:24.10]I thought I stole something.
[211:29.26]Oh, you guys are looking for a bike joke.
[211:31.06]You're all screaming at me.
[211:32.24]Do the bike thing.
[211:33.02]Do a thing with a bike.
[211:34.42]Do something funny with a bike.
[211:38.88]Hmm.
[211:39.38]Uh...
[211:50.72]Yeah, that was funny.
[211:54.38]Funny bike joke.
[211:59.26]Pre-recorded.
[212:02.61]So what?
[212:07.25]There it is.
[212:07.79]You can jump cars.
[212:13.98]Okie dokie, that's a lot of fun.
[212:16.70]Gonna do that a bunch of times.
[212:20.43]Oh!
[212:23.05]We can just do that to every car!
[212:26.47]Why does it have a thing on it?
[212:36.10]Just admitted to being pre-recorded.
[212:40.57]I don't know what this is, but I need it.
[213:03.84]Why would I take this?
[213:06.52]This is an armored car.
[213:07.48]There's gonna be a ton of gold in here.
[213:09.18]It's gold!
[213:09.68]I think that guy's still in the car.
[213:22.23]No, it's just me and a helmet.
[213:23.19]Alright.
[213:23.69]Interesting.
[213:26.99]Stolen goods.
[213:27.59]Drop it off.
[213:29.63]Get some money.
[213:32.76]I want to buy some gold.
[213:34.48]How much is gold?
[213:37.04]It's not that expensive, right?
[213:38.08]I mean, it is, but it isn't.
[213:40.54]How much is a brick of gold?
[213:43.26]Not a coin, not like a little bar.
[213:45.05]I'm talking like a brick of gold, like in the movies.
[213:47.39]You know the joke?
[213:49.01]Gold bar from every movie?
[213:51.01]How much is that?
[213:58.33]Depends.
[213:58.70]I'm talking about like an actual brick of gold.
[214:03.54]That's like $1,300 an ounce.
[214:10.32]$45,000?
[214:19.31]That's a lot.
[214:22.93]That's all I get for this?
[214:24.53]Is 10,000?
[214:24.85]That's kind of annoying.
[214:29.38]Hey.
[214:30.34]Thanks for the bike, stupid.
[214:39.79]One little beep and that's all it takes.
[214:41.07]Alright.
[214:52.88]Here it is.
[214:53.40]This case.
[215:02.04]We can... You know how far this will go?
[215:05.14]If I'm going 100 miles per hour... I don't even care.
[215:07.78]I don't want it.
[215:09.37]If I go 100 miles per hour on the highway with this, I was gonna say, probably can do a huge jump off another car.
[215:18.50]It's $578,000 for a barcode.
[215:19.40]I'll be there in like 30 years.
[215:22.08]Don't worry.
[215:39.63]Race Water Street.
[215:45.28]Wait a minute.
[215:45.70]This is a... Oh.
[215:49.22]It's... I have to race.
[215:50.14]And I decided to use my little bug.
[215:56.55]Essentially, it might not have been a bad idea.
[216:06.38]This is the worst car.
[216:07.42]You mean the car that's the easiest to handle?
[216:11.10]That can get me in any tight corridor.
[216:13.62]Sure, it's not the fastest, but are you looking for speed?
[216:16.40]Or are you looking to win the race?
[216:18.18]Look at all these just totally negligent drivers.
[216:25.43]Smashing into everything.
[216:26.99]The turtle wins the race in the end of the tortoise and the hare.
[216:30.55]And I'm the hare.
[216:38.29]Whoopsie snuffa!
[216:47.97]These are straight lines.
[216:51.67]Turns out probably wasn't the best idea to drive a durable car.
[216:55.83]But this is gonna be the test right here.
[217:00.54]Durable car wins.
[217:03.68]Well, they're all just smashing into each other.
[217:06.54]I prevail.
[217:08.81]Oh no, hold on.
[217:11.37]I have to, I gotta get in front of somebody.
[217:25.80]Cancel it, get in the... tortoise.
[217:28.96]Fucking tortoise.
[217:34.66]Well, let me put it this way.
[217:36.42]If you have a tortoise in a race, where your rabbit gets to run in a straight line, he doesn't get to stop at the grocery store like he does in that story.
[217:50.28]What the fuck was that?
[218:06.58]Did we lose some time?
[218:07.35]Alright, we're good.
[218:13.27]Did we read the same story?
[218:14.51]I would think you did.
[218:18.51]Stupid trees!
[218:19.49]Oh!
[218:20.65]Yeah, the hare does a bunch of dumb shit.
[218:26.46]He knows he's so much faster.
[218:27.86]The tortoise walks the whole time.
[218:30.02]Doesn't stop for anything.
[218:34.08]The hare goes and smokes a bunch of cigarettes.
[218:38.41]He hangs out with a bunch of people, he goes, he reads like a newspaper.
[218:41.83]I wish he was getting the fuck out of the way, like sincerely.
[218:49.94]I just helped him.
[219:00.01]Get out of my fucking way.
[219:02.63]Not gonna happen again, what side is it going on?
[219:09.06]He just gave me super... stu... fucking stupid game.
[219:13.26]Alright, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[219:16.65]Ah, two artist wins.
[219:26.27]Level four.
[219:30.81]So what did that do for me?
[219:32.53]The wedding.
[219:35.23]Ooh, this is gonna be a fun mission.
[219:39.58]What we got here?
[219:40.24]Increase ramming damage.
[219:42.80]I mean, that's... We came this far.
[219:45.24]What's this last one?
[219:47.94]Police trunk key.
[219:49.00]Way can obtain firearms from the trunks of police cards.
[219:51.50]Yeah.
[219:53.43]Next level for sure.
[219:54.19]Let's go to the wedding.
[220:02.71]We do need to change.
[220:03.41]We gotta have better clothes than this, right?
[220:08.55]Should not even give a shit to show up in like a tank top for jeans.
[220:14.81]There's a statue over there, but already going too fast.
[220:21.29]I feel like I should take a left.
[220:35.18]Bronze statue, best man.
[220:38.99]Hold on, wait.
[220:39.65]Have we gone down here into this garage?
[220:45.13]Yeah, we have.
[220:50.03]I killed a guy!
[220:52.20]Well, those are bad guys anyways.
[220:53.38]Who cares?
[220:57.16]I know I missed a statue.
[221:00.66]I gotta, like, re- Okay, here we go.
[221:05.05]Watch Rocket.
[221:09.99]I think I want this.
[221:12.09]$69,000?
[221:16.49]Yeah, I want it.
[221:19.66]Ooh, this is fast.
[221:22.34]$69,000.
[221:22.36]It is a Screamer, that's for sure.
[221:37.53]Alright, he better close.
[221:45.66]There it is.
[221:46.32]Got it!
[221:49.38]So I was looking to do the whole time, again.
[221:52.55]Sorry.
[222:02.73]Not even the fastest bike.
[222:04.31]Yeah, I can get the fastest bike.
[222:07.31]Not right this second.
[222:08.83]Doesn't have to be right.
[222:13.60]Okay, alright.
[222:14.86]Alright.
[222:16.20]Relax.
[222:17.40]Relax, relax.
[222:19.58]Relax, everybody.
[222:20.40]I have my helmet on.
[222:21.46]I'm fine.
[222:22.05]Don't freak out.
[222:37.58]I need a clothing store.
[222:38.62]Clothing.
[222:39.00]Anybody see a clothing store?
[222:42.30]There's a clothing store over there.
[222:43.52]Fuck, I need clothes.
[222:55.35]God!
[222:55.99]I wasn't even going that fast!
[222:58.97]I was going pretty slow, actually.
[223:07.18]Show up to the wedding in a full body cast.
[223:14.61]I almost got it.
[223:15.99]I can get it.
[223:16.57]Watch this.
[223:18.11]Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch.
[223:19.02]We'll get it.
[223:19.34]Want to trade?
[223:25.80]Show up as a Glue Man.
[223:35.21]I can get the bike over there.
[223:36.85]I'm certain of it.
[223:39.63]Hey, you guys are so close!
[223:51.66]I'm just trying to get back on my bike.
[223:52.76]Alright, here we go.
[223:54.36]Watch.
[223:56.18]I'm gonna show you how I get behind that counter.
[224:02.58]Camry, you're not doing me any favors.
[224:08.22]We've got to take this down.
[224:09.12]Alright, here we go.
[224:09.72]Ready?
[224:09.92]We've got to get a straight shot.
[224:16.34]Cock the bike back.
[224:20.03]It's got to be right down the middle there.
[224:21.55]Right here.
[224:23.67]Right there.
[224:24.85]Yeah, right there.
[224:26.21]That looks good.
[224:28.71]Back it up a little bit.
[224:33.85]Wait for the traffic to die down.
[224:35.52]Here we go.
[224:39.93]Aligned... incorrectly.
[224:41.39]Is it gonna be worth it?
[224:43.65]Of course it is.
[224:48.63]Fuck.
[224:57.19]Just wait!
[224:57.87]Just wait.
[225:02.37]I'm gonna try this one more time, and then I'm fuckin' throwing an axe.
[225:07.54]DAAAH!
[225:13.41]I'm painting her counter with blood.
[225:17.90]There's so much blood in here.
[225:20.36]What would this guy be doing this for?
[225:25.78]The summer store.
[225:31.11]Looks like it's here intentionally.
[225:45.66]Alright, bye.
[225:46.48]What will this achieve?
[225:51.58]I was trying to jump off the... Okay, I've been falling off the fucking bike so much more than usual.
[226:05.53]Seriously.
[226:06.43]Is anyone putting that together?
[226:08.69]Two and two together?
[226:10.02]Why now am I flying off the bike over and over again?
[226:17.27]I'm getting this.
[226:18.91]I only need like two more after this anyway.
[226:26.67]No, one more actually.
[226:39.10]Alright, let's go.
[226:42.00]One more of those.
[226:45.07]Here's the clothing store, though.
[226:46.13]Let's, like, look halfway decent to go to this wedding.
[226:48.75]Let's be real about it.
[226:49.55]Be serious.
[226:51.23]You know what I mean?
[226:53.79]Uh, it's on the other side.
[227:07.43]Has that turned into a bunch of pigeons?
[227:28.95]I don't know.
[227:29.39]How did this happen?
[227:40.74]Oh, fuck!
[227:45.52]Oh, god damn it.
[227:46.54]I was trying to get... Oh, it's so funny.
[227:51.65]See how funny that was?
[227:55.59]Very funny.
[227:56.67]Hysterical.
[227:58.07]Absolutely fucking hysterical.
[228:06.10]I can't even buy anything now.
[228:12.76]Let me take care of this.
[228:13.90]And then I can buy things again.
[228:26.10]A small animal?
[228:29.18]What's with all the blood?
[228:31.27]I just ran over somebody's dog or something.
[228:33.47]What the fuck happened?
[228:36.37]Was there like a colony of bugs over here?
[228:38.51]Shit!
[228:58.85]I'm gonna go get the statues over here.
[229:00.08]Hmm, how do I get over there?
[229:14.58]There?
[229:16.62]Somewhere?
[229:20.63]Where the hell are these things?
[229:24.89]Explosive barrels?
[229:27.49]Oh, okay.
[229:28.85]I will take this.
[229:36.30]Can't jump up that at all.
[229:41.10]Statue sense is tingling, but I can't really do anything about it.
[229:43.96]Maybe I can.
[229:49.96]Maybe I can.
[229:51.06]Let's see.
[229:53.10]There we go.
[229:54.78]Now, where are they?
[229:55.74]Across the street is blinking up there.
[229:58.14]I'm gonna go... Can I make it across that?
[230:05.04]Fuck!
[230:06.22]No, I think it's okay.
[230:10.17]Yeah, it is.
[230:10.45]It's fine.
[230:18.01]And we are... there.
[230:23.07]Almost.
[230:29.77]I'm gonna get the statue on another mission anyways.
[230:32.88]Well, I mean, I am right here.
[230:38.16]Can't climb up that.
[230:44.10]Really?
[230:44.32]Can I go up here?
[230:48.73]Yeah.
[230:52.33]Climb it!
[230:58.95]I'm gonna jump across here to there, and no other things up here?
[231:01.66]Okay.
[231:12.42]I believe... I made it.
[231:15.16]Yes, I did.
[231:16.16]Max health increased!
[231:16.94]Hooray.
[231:26.27]Statue's down there, it seems.
[231:30.58]Is it?
[231:31.22]Where is it?
[231:36.97]I can't climb up that.
[231:41.97]Hmm.
[231:42.85]Let's take a look.
[231:44.90]Well, you didn't have to jump that far!
[231:46.86]Holy shit.
[231:49.32]What's in there?
[231:52.06]I don't think I can go in here.
[231:53.00]Yeah, I can't get it.
[231:59.19]Well, at least I got the health upgrade.
[232:06.45]You alright?
[232:08.25]Alright, we're cool.
[232:11.91]I'm doing the cop mission too.
[232:13.89]Might as well, it's right here.
[232:18.05]And then we're gonna change clothes and then we're gonna do the wedding.
[232:30.88]I just dropped from 150 feet.
[232:33.56]And landed on top of some guy.
[232:36.21]These missions are really easy.
[232:37.33]Uh, alright.
[232:44.84]Um... I was not... I thought I had to turn out there.
[232:49.64]I guess not.
[232:52.86]This is really easy, I say.
[232:54.02]And the guy drives by me.
[233:07.76]There we go.
[233:08.06]That's better.
[233:08.44]I like the regular rules better than the super fast rules.
[233:19.26]He's just driving in a circle.
[233:28.10]I couldn't tell which way he was going.
[233:32.49]Get over here.
[233:44.39]You're under arrest.
[233:46.87]Anything you say and do will be held against you in that thing.
[233:51.21]They get you in trouble.
[234:13.96]Arrested.
[234:22.89]Under arrest.
[234:30.63]What?
[234:31.77]Okay.
[234:37.47]Sure, I guess I did it.
[234:41.70]Alright, that's that.
[234:42.82]Let's... Okay, now I can go into the clothing store.
[234:46.83]No problems.
[234:48.51]No bikes.
[234:51.61]They're taunting me with this bike.
[234:54.23]They didn't despawn it.
[234:55.17]They put it right in front of the door.
[234:59.39]I'm not going to eat the devil's apple here, guys.
[235:01.99]Sorry.
[235:05.09]Let's get something nice here.
[235:12.40]This is not how you go to a wedding.
[235:23.04]These all suck.
[235:24.18]Your store sucks.
[235:26.84]I hate your store.
[235:27.58]It's awful.
[235:31.38]Give me the legendary toy store.
[235:39.78]The legendary clothing store.
[235:43.38]Is there one?
[235:43.80]I'm just gonna take a cab.
[235:44.92]There's only one over here.
[235:50.82]You get a tux for the wedding anyways.
[235:52.26]Oh, well, then who gives a shit?
[235:53.60]Let's just do it.
[236:01.37]Nobody got hurt.
[236:03.97]Relax, chat.
[236:04.73]Everyone's fine.
[236:08.88]What's wrong with this bike?
[236:13.98]Okay.
[236:15.64]Silent bike.
[236:20.40]I kinda like the silent bike.
[236:26.99]Silent bike is pretty awesome, actually.
[236:29.07]I'm sad I'm gonna lose it.
[236:32.71]It's the electric upgrade?
[236:35.67]It would make noise.
[236:43.32]Pick up your tuxedo.
[236:44.60]Here we go.
[236:50.11]I'm ready for the wedding.
[236:52.21]Gotta get that next button buttoned, man.
[236:57.47]Drive to the banquet hall.
[237:07.95]Now it makes noise again.
[237:10.87]I'm definitely gonna bring the bike with me.
[237:13.56]For sure.
[237:34.69]It's like they knew.
[237:36.13]They knew.
[237:36.53]I wasn't gonna cause havoc.
[237:40.22]I was just gonna drive very fast into this place.
[237:43.94]It's nice to see someone who wants to be a good family man.
[238:01.85]Not enough of that nowadays.
[238:04.27]Hi.
[238:04.77]You look absolutely lovely, my dear.
[238:07.80]Thank you.
[238:08.50]Almost as lovely as your mother-in-law.
[238:11.90]Oh, and Mrs. Chu.
[238:13.44]I expect the food to be... Wait, wait.
[238:15.56]Fantastic.
[238:16.68]I got a case of the chairman's favorite wine in my car.
[238:19.88]I forgot to bring it in.
[238:21.40]Do you mind grabbing in and making sure they know it's for him?
[238:24.30]I'm gonna make sure he gets inside, okay?
[238:26.59]There's gonna be a GTA 4 situation where they drive up and they shoot Roman.
[238:34.27]Or if you played a different way, they drive up and they shoot the girl, right?
[238:38.31]That's what's gonna happen, right?
[238:40.63]Or the car explodes.
[238:41.47]I'm not sure which one's gonna happen.
[238:52.82]They locked it.
[238:55.36]I don't know what to do.
[239:00.64]I don't know what to do.
[239:06.38]I don't know what to do.
[239:09.56]Hmm.
[239:09.72]I wonder if I should climb up this.
[239:12.68]No, wait.
[239:12.94]That one's not green.
[239:13.96]It's this one.
[239:14.48]Shit.
[239:21.41]You didn't do it.
[239:23.76]I know what's going on inside.
[239:29.86]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[239:42.75]Oh, not the expensive wines.
[239:48.68]No fuck with somebody on their wedding day.
[239:56.76]Fucking chefs.
[240:16.67]See you later.
[240:17.15]Anybody else?
[240:22.68]Down below?
[240:23.30]Yep.
[240:25.18]Got some perps.
[240:30.32]Oh, he's got a knife.
[240:31.02]Come on.
[240:33.30]Use it.
[240:33.96]What do we got?
[240:53.82]That... Oh, I slit his throat.
[240:59.30]Okay... Can I... Can I... I still don't know what that is.
[241:06.13]I gotta look that up afterwards.
[241:08.37]Holy shit!
[241:09.25]You got a gun.
[241:11.25]I need that gun.
[241:14.43]He's still alive.
[241:29.30]Whoa!
[241:29.58]What are you doing behind me?
[241:34.04]Okay, relax.
[241:37.41]Holding somebody?
[241:37.91]Holding a hostage?
[241:40.11]How did you guys even get back here?
[241:41.63]Is what I want to know.
[241:57.68]They're just waiting for me to get back here.
[241:59.06]That guy's holding a hostage.
[242:00.20]He's like, just any minute now.
[242:02.76]Any minute now, you'll be back here.
[242:04.16]Where's the person with the hostage?
[242:16.27]Clumsy.
[242:19.01]Oh, no.
[242:22.47]That's not good.
[242:29.34]Out of here.
[242:30.93]Cheek.
[242:32.23]She doesn't deserve this.
[242:35.31]Winston.
[242:37.09]Winston.
[242:38.87]Fuck.
[242:40.99]Oh, shit.
[242:42.36]Peggy.
[242:45.22]Shit.
[242:47.28]That's sad.
[242:55.33]I'm fucking around now.
[242:59.55]I'll take the tactical machine gun.
[243:01.99]Sounds like a plan to me.
[243:07.57]What was his name?
[243:09.65]Gun.
[243:09.91]Defeat the gun.
[243:14.17]Power!
[243:14.61]Unlimited power!
[243:32.10]The first few rounds were like 400 caliber anti-tank weapons.
[243:38.67]Wait, what's that?
[243:40.29]Give me this thing instead.
[243:45.63]Who the fuck are you?
[243:57.26]Whoa!
[243:57.96]Don't die.
[243:59.30]Not worth dying here.
[244:12.18]Clear out all the catering staff.
[244:16.14]Okay, I'll try.
[244:17.04]Nobody's gonna be wrapping around.
[244:23.61]I already got like a lot of them anyways, so... Okay, I gotta save that lady!
[244:28.33]Save the lady!
[244:42.59]Mammy, you alright?
[244:43.51]She's fine.
[244:48.79]One different gun.
[244:53.15]I dropped this somehow.
[244:57.39]Come on, through the pot.
[245:02.08]Through the pot.
[245:02.82]Through the pot.
[245:03.66]Through the pot.
[245:04.56]Through the pot.
[245:05.82]Ah!
[245:07.84]So satisfying.
[245:12.65]Give me another gun.
[245:13.29]There we go.
[245:16.96]Double cross.
[245:17.86]It's always in one of these stories.
[245:22.78]Who's that?
[245:23.60]Bad guy?
[245:30.89]Are you good?
[245:33.57]I can't tell.
[245:34.11]I don't understand.
[245:36.59]Come with me for a minute.
[245:38.25]I don't know.
[245:38.65]This could be a double cross.
[245:46.85]I'm not gonna shoot him.
[245:48.63]Uncle Paul!
[245:49.89]Are you okay?
[245:51.33]Can you walk?
[245:52.89]What's going on?
[245:54.65]That guy had his head stuck in a present.
[245:56.31]Okay, come on.
[245:58.07]We gotta get you out of here.
[246:03.04]Well, don't worry.
[246:03.68]I replaced him with another person.
[246:05.64]Uncle Paul!
[246:06.14]Yeah, see?
[246:07.08]You're hurt.
[246:09.30]It's nothing but a little scratch.
[246:11.26]You look sore.
[246:12.86]We gotta get you to a hospital.
[246:15.99]What the fuck was that?
[246:17.39]That was a please shoot me I'm a civilian in any, like, old Nintendo game.
[246:22.29]Seriously.
[246:22.77]Somehow I shot the lady.
[246:34.74]What the fuck are you people doing?
[246:47.06]Uh, Uncle Bo!
[246:48.60]You have any secret exits?
[246:54.76]I think he's dead.
[247:00.83]Look, my aim isn't that great!
[247:06.87]Because I'm holding a person in my other hand.
[247:13.39]Where are they?
[247:17.47]Down here, there's a guy right there.
[247:19.51]Just don't move.
[247:20.93]Thanks.
[247:21.43]Appreciate it.
[247:22.41]Almost at the rendezvous point.
[247:26.39]We're fine.
[247:26.83]I made it.
[247:27.41]I see a statue over there.
[247:48.13]Oh, fuck.
[247:48.71]Oh no, we didn't make it.
[247:49.75]Bring him across the road.
[247:50.73]I just, I fucking put lead in your body.
[247:58.62]Lots of it.
[248:05.37]Oh my god.
[248:06.55]Come on, Poe.
[248:10.55]Come on, Poe.
[248:11.51]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[248:16.47]Go, go, go, go, go.
[248:17.57]Safe.
[248:21.01]My uncle, he's hurt.
[248:22.47]We need a doctor.
[248:23.39]Now!
[248:23.75]What is this?
[248:24.92]What's going on here?
[248:26.04]That's rich.
[248:27.40]Maybe you'll want to leave before our friends, the police, show up.
[248:35.40]Are you going to take care of my uncle?
[248:36.98]And if anything happens to him, I'm holding you personally responsible.
[248:40.67]That's not fair.
[248:41.43]Okay, okay.
[248:44.13]Some random doctor.
[248:45.97]I know he was shot like 35 times, but if he dies, you're responsible for it.
[248:51.56]Uh, how about the people that shot him?
[248:53.40]Dozens of times.
[248:54.06]It's a lot of pressure to put on a medical professional.
[249:02.02]Meet the rendezvous.
[249:02.58]Where have you been?
[249:13.79]Stuck in traffic.
[249:15.75]It's Hong Kong.
[249:16.51]Fuck, Raymond.
[249:17.35]You think showing up for these things is easy for me?
[249:19.89]I know you've been through a lot, boy.
[249:21.65]More than we have any right to ask.
[249:24.37]Now, the wedding.
[249:25.41]It was a massacre, Raymond.
[249:27.07]A massacre.
[249:28.12]Winston was a red pole, sure.
[249:29.38]But his wife?
[249:30.40]He fucking gunned down his wife on her wedding day.
[249:33.04]We knew you would become personally attached, Raymond.
[249:35.44]It's inevitable in an operation like this.
[249:37.78]And seeing something like that would be hard.
[249:40.39]Hard for anyone.
[249:41.59]It's war now.
[249:42.79]No, it's not.
[249:43.79]You're a cop.
[249:44.99]Alright?
[249:45.89]Your job is to enforce the law.
[249:47.19]You can't remember that?
[249:48.33]I'll pull you out right now.
[249:49.51]Pull me out?
[249:50.37]Your job was to get close to Winston.
[249:52.21]Now, that's not much of a strategy anymore.
[249:53.75]Get close to?
[249:54.97]Open your eyes, Raymond.
[249:56.03]I am Winston now.
[249:56.77]Push over the back.
[249:57.45]Push over the railing.
[249:57.97]Now.
[249:58.15]With him gone, I'll be taking his place.
[250:00.05]You want the chairman?
[250:01.13]I report to him now.
[250:02.29]You want the red poles?
[250:03.49]I'm one of them.
[250:05.13]That's what worries me, Wei.
[250:06.95]You're one of them.
[250:09.63]You want to give up the best undercover HKPD has ever had?
[250:12.88]Your best shot taking down the sun on Yi?
[250:17.25]Exactly.
[250:19.49]We done?
[250:20.73]Yeah, we're done.
[250:26.74]I mean, yes, he is.
[250:28.92]He is dressed as him now.
[250:31.42]I'm kind of turning into that character.
[250:36.95]I am the Senate.
[250:50.92]Alright.
[250:52.42]This is a bad dream.
[250:55.62]Oh, no.
[250:55.94]It was a bad dream.
[250:57.42]I'm in my shitty apartment again.
[251:00.17]That was a dream, too?
[251:06.07]Oh, no.
[251:08.27]I'm going back to Bicentennial, man.
[251:15.28]Oh, it actually is his clothes.
[251:18.21]Monk high roller.
[251:20.91]Lightning warrior.
[251:23.33]Policeman.
[251:26.29]Can't wear that.
[251:29.13]Be the dragon.
[251:29.87]Grubby clothes.
[251:34.37]Super spot tactical uniform.
[251:37.93]Wedding outfit.
[251:41.63]That's kind of horrible.
[251:43.85]Go get drunken master.
[251:44.75]Alright, let's go get drunken master.
[251:45.93]I don't know if I have enough money for it though.
[251:54.51]I'm not sure I have the cash for Drunken Master.
[251:58.11]I want to get in there.
[251:59.45]It's $350,000?
[251:59.61]Well, looks like we aren't getting it.
[252:01.19]Which money do I have?
[252:02.21]Okay, where's my cool car?
[252:04.71]There it is.
[252:24.90]I only have so much money.
[252:26.10]I can't buy them all.
[252:34.25]Let's get this next mission started.
[252:40.39]Drunken has its own fighting style.
[252:44.01]We'll save up for that then.
[252:44.91]I want to try that.
[252:45.55]That sounds fun.
[252:47.61]I do want to try the grappling hook too.
[252:49.17]That seems like a lot of fun as well.
[252:53.36]10k, Jesus.
[252:54.06]Wait, is it really?
[252:55.18]What was everyone freaking out about?
[252:56.54]350.
[252:56.70]I'm gonna go get it right now.
[252:59.62]You know something else I've noticed about this game?
[253:12.63]It runs really, really, really well.
[253:16.01]There's not very much slowdown in this game.
[253:20.07]It's optimized very well.
[253:21.21]Now, I mean, this is the definitive edition.
[253:23.29]So I guess they probably did improvements to it.
[253:26.76]But it is a crystal, super smooth, buttery.
[253:30.74]At least 60 FPS.
[253:39.47]What?
[253:39.63]Preset outfits.
[253:40.17]Here we go.
[253:41.29]Drunken Fist.
[253:42.21]Let's try it.
[253:43.05]Killing your face-beater will now activate the Drunken Fist stance, enabling way to perform special moves and counters.
[254:09.77]Well, we'll give it a try at some point.
[254:14.35]I wonder what it does.
[254:15.09]Alright, let's keep going.
[254:16.85]A couple of cop missions.
[254:20.38]A lot of random missions.
[254:26.86]Cheaters Never Prosper Part 2.
[254:29.48]Distract the cops.
[254:31.86]Clothing.
[254:32.18]There's a lot to do.
[254:32.78]Hmm.
[254:36.81]I would like to complete this game by tomorrow.
[254:41.59]So if we wrap it up here in the next, like I said, what did I say, like about five hours or so?
[254:47.96]I'd like to finish the game tomorrow.
[254:50.30]So however long that takes to see everything we want to see, you will not finish the game tomorrow.
[254:59.54]I won't.
[255:02.69]You don't think I'll finish this game in like seven more hours?
[255:10.27]Because that would mean it was like six hours yesterday, like five hours today, and like seven hours tomorrow.
[255:20.71]So this game is long then.
[255:25.67]Just do it, add an extra stream.
[255:30.03]I might do that then.
[255:31.83]We're going to finish this game this weekend.
[255:35.91]Wow, okay.
[255:36.43]Well, that's good to know.
[255:37.55]Yeah, that's cool.
[255:45.10]Yeah, I'll do a stream on like... You know, I might do it on... I'm trying to think of the best.
[255:50.33]There'll be a weekend stream with this game if we can't finish it.
[255:52.71]So at that point that would be... Like 28 hours?
[255:56.57]Like 24 hours?
[255:56.95]6, 12, 18, 24, yeah.
[255:57.27]I think I can finish this game in 20 to 30 hours.
[255:58.73]I think that's possible.
[255:59.63]Let's just get to the next mission.
[256:12.53]I keep... I am forgetting this actually would be scary.
[256:16.83]There's a guy just driving a motorcycle down the road.
[256:19.17]Everyone's diving out of the way.
[256:24.58]Get out of the way!
[256:32.98]He's here for a drink!
[256:36.24]That's right, I've made it!
[256:38.22]I'll take your finest Pinot Grigio!
[256:44.16]There's a statue over here.
[256:57.21]That guy was on his fucking telephone beard.
[256:59.17]Did you see that?
[257:03.97]Where's the statue?
[257:05.09]Didn't already get this?
[257:06.71]Strange.
[257:16.08]Yeah, we'll finish this game this week.
[257:23.20]And then, um... I might be getting a Switch... Nintendo Labo stream.
[257:31.41]I really am going to just buy a Switch to do the Nintendo Labo stream.
[257:35.85]That'll probably be next week.
[257:37.93]We'll put a sock in after this week.
[257:44.02]Just get out of here without killing anybody.
[257:50.36]Like I got electrocuted.
[257:52.05]I had 45,000 bolts that went through that guy's body.
[257:56.81]That was a nice jump.
[258:26.33]Yeah, but I'm probably going to do that.
[258:28.21]That's going to be the most expensive one-off stream I've ever done.
[258:34.20]That's going to be a Jerma expensive.
[258:36.74]What was it?
[258:37.60]$200 for a switch?
[258:38.56]Like $100 for the Labo?
[258:40.86]For like a 35-minute stream?
[258:42.14]It's going to be worth it.
[258:48.14]Zodiac tourney?
[258:56.24]Fucking Zodiac Tourney.
[259:02.06]What are you guys on about here?
[259:04.79]What are you guys on about?
[259:05.63]What are you guys on about?
[259:12.65]Orange Fist, top right?
[259:15.39]Zodiac Tournament.
[259:17.75]Alright.
[259:19.90]Alright.
[259:21.14]Let's do it.
[259:37.01]I can't get pulled over for speeding.
[259:38.48]Can I just go?
[259:45.90]Shortcut.
[259:55.25]Was that a shortcut?
[259:56.61]No, not.
[260:04.63]No, don't call Roland.
[260:06.79]Can I hang up on him?
[260:08.19]Roland, got any work for me?
[260:10.43]Yeah, sure.
[260:11.67]Samson Gao, your typical deadbeat.
[260:14.87]Moron is hiding out on an overpass in North Point.
[260:18.29]Where the hell am I?
[260:20.67]He's wrong.
[260:23.46]Yeah, yeah.
[260:24.20]No, I made it.
[260:25.04]It was there.
[260:25.36]It's just right down here.
[260:30.40]Ugh!
[260:34.49]I will eat one of these, though.
[260:37.93]I'm so hungry right now.
[260:40.03]We might have to pick this up tomorrow.
[260:44.69]I'm so hungry.
[260:47.09]I eat before the streams, man, and I just get so hungry and I go eat for like 35 straight minutes.
[260:51.15]Alright, that was unnecessary, but whatever.
[260:56.71]Alright, what do you got?
[261:02.27]Tournament time?
[261:04.71]I mean, I could just... I could push Scorpion into the water.
[261:08.11]Let's give it a try.
[261:11.77]It is recommended that you earn more upgrades to enter the Zodiac Tournament.
[261:14.53]Do you earn... Shut up.
[261:17.85]Stupid.
[261:29.44]Feature presentation?
[261:30.66]What the fuck is this?
[261:35.60]Is this part of the... This is probably... This is DLC, huh?
[261:39.18]Has to be.
[261:53.49]Um... The Zodiac Tournament.
[262:03.82]I'm about to go do an entire DLC that's supposed to do... Maybe I... Okay.
[262:10.83]We'll try it.
[262:21.40]Are these all my friends?
[262:33.76]What?
[262:34.14]Ascend the stairs and reach the temple?
[262:39.74]What is going on over here?
[262:45.64]Fuck outta here!
[262:54.19]You think I'm fucking around?
[262:56.79]I'll show you, reality TV!
[263:04.31]Why don't you pay for this on fucking pay-per-view?
[263:20.36]Ow!
[263:22.73]Yeah, sleep with the fish's dickheads.
[263:34.14]The mixed martial arts style combines wrestling with striking.
[263:37.32]It can pose problems for conventional martial artists.
[263:40.12]Is that Christopher Walken?
[263:46.43]I'll just make it to the top.
[263:49.13]So, we're all competing.
[263:50.23]This is a big competition.
[263:52.17]You know what I'm saying?
[263:52.75]Like, in that case, this is a competition.
[263:55.45]So, if everyone wants to talk shit, I have to be the fucking number one.
[264:01.69]I'm right.
[264:01.99]I can't do anything.
[264:10.49]The last guy did put up a fight, you're right.
[264:11.93]Took out 70% of the competition.
[264:18.26]I just drowned like 12 students.
[264:31.43]Strangely enough, I thought there were 24 applicants.
[264:35.79]Hmm.
[264:36.95]Why are there only nine people here?
[264:39.74]Oh, well.
[264:41.24]Let us continue with the training.
[264:43.88]Each has paid one million dollars for the privilege of being here.
[264:50.56]They will wager far more on your performance.
[264:55.10]Do not disappoint them.
[264:58.66]You are the best of the best...
[265:02.71]You beat up an entire school of like magenta belts.
[265:05.10]Alright.
[265:05.52]Speak with some of the other fighters.
[265:32.73]How about you?
[265:33.67]Yeah, so take a fall.
[265:34.67]Take a fall.
[265:59.80]Who are you?
[266:00.26]Who are you?
[266:00.96]You know, I would probably fail, but I was gonna grab him and throw him down the stairs.
[266:22.90]Hey.
[266:22.98]Let's do it.
[266:24.13]I'm done playing games.
[266:25.81]Tournament.
[266:26.49]Here it is.
[266:27.45]The Chopped Tournament of Champions.
[266:54.82]Qualifying around this should be easy.
[266:56.24]These are all magenta belts.
[267:02.23]Yeah, I fucking buried three of your other friends.
[267:16.65]Double kill.
[267:20.21]Yeah, what's that?
[267:20.69]I'm gonna burn your face.
[267:23.93]The crowd goes wild.
[267:24.77]This is better than a cockfight anything.
[267:30.21]You guys even practice?
[267:34.84]How's your yacht?
[267:37.18]227 feet tall.
[267:38.22]Defeat the enemies.
[267:41.10]Ah, brother, I am so sorry.
[267:44.71]Drunken master.
[267:45.51]No, wait a minute.
[267:46.25]I don't think that matters here.
[267:49.11]I'm sure you're still better than someone.
[268:06.49]Oh, oh big guy watch out with big guy Don't think so big guy.
[268:19.80]Ah, I do think so I do I
[268:30.39]Shit!
[268:30.97]Whoa!
[268:33.13]What are you trying to run away to?
[268:34.32]What are you doing?
[268:35.06]I'm fine.
[268:41.78]Just don't wanna get grabbed.
[268:46.68]Don't grab me.
[268:47.40]That guy's the grabber.
[268:48.26]I don't like the grabbers.
[269:07.77]I don't like the grabber, he's gonna grab me!
[269:14.53]Well, that was a shoe printed directly in his mouth.
[269:19.19]Alright, I'll be ready.
[269:20.27]Alright, be quiet here.
[269:45.98]Shit, I grab her.
[269:53.73]I'm good.
[269:57.67]Fuck.
[269:59.07]Fuck.
[269:59.45]I missed him.
[270:32.91]Fuck you!
[270:39.13]Stomp his head.
[270:39.91]No, I'm good.
[270:43.18]I don't like this camera.
[270:48.40]Alright, just two grappers and that's it.
[271:19.66]Alright.
[271:20.34]That should be it.
[271:20.84]ResidentSleeper dogs.
[271:23.30]The ear slap.
[271:23.68]Cliffhanger.
[271:24.00]This is cool.
[271:24.56]They told me I wasn't prepared.
[271:29.02]How dare they.
[271:53.56]Reach the cliffside We can throw guy off cliffside, but apparently not We just have to run around
[272:24.02]Oh, this guy.
[272:26.32]Oh, sorry, guy.
[272:28.58]Maybe I could have helped you.
[272:36.53]You're in my way.
[272:38.05]Oh, shit.
[272:38.65]Fortnite.
[272:39.09]Of course there's a guy from fucking Fortnite.
[272:43.62]Where's the stream sniper?
[272:45.14]Yeah, give me the shotgun.
[272:47.08]I'll take care of him.
[272:59.04]Come on, let me be relevant for five seconds, guys.
[273:06.87]Okay, I'm trying to make you buy that.
[273:11.53]Why was I even puking?
[273:25.28]I've hit every single one of those.
[273:29.66]Alright, next arena.
[273:30.18]Fight me.
[273:30.60]He's getting a head start.
[273:32.32]What?
[273:32.56]He gets a head start.
[273:33.32]What the fuck?
[273:33.80]Not today.
[273:34.24]Sorry, buddy.
[274:00.47]What is this thing doing?
[274:02.05]I'm gonna impale him?
[274:04.92]Oh my god.
[274:05.64]I thought this was supposed to be a school of training.
[274:09.58]That was the most brutal thing so far.
[274:29.46]I've never seen these guys before.
[274:30.52]They're kind of freaking me out.
[274:38.19]Last man standing.
[274:38.83]It's funny because no one else is attacking anybody else.
[274:43.39]I scared that guy a little.
[274:45.39]Aw, too bad.
[274:49.48]He could have gone right over the edge.
[275:00.73]Break his leg.
[275:02.13]Scare everybody.
[275:06.23]Wait, what?
[275:06.75]Okay, so here's the first real fight.
[275:10.69]Defeat the other... Alright, that's... Alright, be quiet here.
[275:15.14]Don't defend them all at the same time, okay?
[275:19.38]Let's go kick this guy's ass.
[275:32.59]Alright, will you fucking die?
[275:36.77]Impale that guy?
[275:37.51]Alright, well, I tried to grab him.
[275:41.15]That didn't work.
[275:41.79]He's done.
[275:42.52]And... Hi-yah!
[276:02.16]First boss.
[276:05.54]And... Whoa, he's a grabber.
[276:07.61]He's a grabber.
[276:08.29]He's a grabber.
[276:08.89]Get this guy out of here.
[276:16.59]He's gonna fuck me up.
[276:17.31]Alright, here we go.
[276:17.97]One-on-one.
[276:21.14]What do you got?
[276:24.56]Grab?
[276:24.78]Yeah.
[276:25.54]Yeah.
[276:32.95]Can I grab him?
[276:33.67]Nope.
[276:38.77]No grabs, don't grab me.
[276:54.42]No grabs, don't grab me.
[277:06.44]No grabs.
[277:06.78]Don't grab me.
[277:08.30]Ooh, ouch.
[277:16.01]What do you got?
[277:20.51]Now you're in trouble.
[277:36.40]Ooh, wait, he blocked it.
[277:42.18]Uh-oh.
[277:58.90]Got a counter.
[277:59.72]Oh, get fucking stomped.
[278:02.88]Here we go.
[278:03.24]Up at the edge.
[278:05.96]No, I guess I cannot physically grab this guy at all.
[278:08.22]Fine.
[278:14.63]You wanna play games?
[278:26.70]Just give me a full meter, dickhead.
[278:34.88]See you later.
[278:36.98]Snap his fucking neck.
[278:41.95]That was fun.
[278:46.77]Gong, gong, gong, gong.
[278:49.91]Rejet!
[278:51.09]If I rejet, I lose.
[278:52.43]I don't think he can beat the boss.
[278:58.21]He doesn't seem grabbable.
[279:05.44]Wait, why am I banned?
[279:05.94]What are you talking about?
[279:07.00]What did I do?
[279:08.64]I like this mode.
[279:13.23]This is fun.
[279:13.71]Should've used the gong.
[279:14.95]It's alright.
[279:30.65]I don't know, you can't gong him.
[279:32.41]I couldn't grab him.
[279:33.05]Maybe when he was dazed I could have ended it with a gong, but I ended it with a neck-breaking face punch.
[279:37.75]Equally as cool.
[279:39.23]Alright, after this we're gonna... I'm gonna wrap it up after this one.
[279:49.86]We'll start off tomorrow with this, though.
[279:51.20]I like this a lot.
[279:52.62]It's actually a challenging fighting.
[279:54.68]I want to do that.
[279:55.26]It's fun.
[280:01.69]I could gong the other guys?
[280:02.55]Well, I could grab the other guys.
[280:03.73]I couldn't grab him.
[280:05.09]No matter what I could do.
[280:06.69]Alright, here's the fight.
[280:07.41]This fight with the eyepatch lady.
[280:15.60]She's gonna poison me.
[280:17.42]Don't.
[280:17.68]Yeah, it's poison.
[280:23.76]Told you.
[280:28.22]I knew it.
[280:28.74]Fucking knew it.
[280:30.29]Get him!
[280:31.17]Your tournament is finished, you piece of shit.
[280:38.01]Oh, crap.
[280:40.17]I was trying to get in the boat.
[280:44.90]Hey, watch this.
[280:46.18]You know how to deal with those, right?
[280:47.90]How do you deal with people that don't like water?
[280:49.92]You bunch of fucking cats.
[281:00.20]Can't grab a grabber.
[281:04.50]But I will grab this.
[281:08.70]Alright, let's do it.
[281:10.94]Goodbye.
[281:19.59]If I follow the path to the next event, it's gonna be fight- I gotta fight her while I'm drunk and poisoned and shit, right?
[281:33.59]Can I go this way?
[281:34.17]No.
[281:34.31]I have to go all the way to the other side.
[281:35.69]This is actually making me kind of sick.
[281:52.11]Drowning's the new burning.
[281:53.09]Make it diarrhea.
[282:01.37]That's the problem.
[282:09.08]Goddamn you fool.
[282:13.07]Watch it.
[282:19.18]Careful, you have to pay us $150.
[282:20.38]I'm not in an Uber right now.
[282:24.04]I'm not in a Lyft.
[282:34.36]Yeah, fight her on the beach.
[282:35.30]Um... Why am I hurt?
[282:36.44]What's going on?
[282:37.70]Um... Did we skip?
[282:38.32]Defeat George.
[282:38.88]Ah!
[283:03.66]Oh, it's hard to even see when he's not gonna block.
[283:05.98]This guy wants to ground.
[283:11.70]Let's see what he does.
[283:16.71]Got out of it.
[283:24.91]Aw, I can't even see it.
[283:27.89]The indicator's not there!
[283:30.04]Not good!
[283:34.04]Yeah, my ground game's pretty good, isn't it?
[283:42.30]Come on, attack.
[284:05.78]Block it.
[284:06.44]Come on, Facebeater!
[284:07.44]No, he can't take the sweep!
[284:48.95]He's hurt.
[284:52.03]See you later.
[284:53.01]Victory number two.
[284:56.01]Your winner, Mr. Wei Shen.
[285:01.35]Break his leg?
[285:02.09]I could have grabbed him, bro.
[285:03.19]That was a good idea.
[285:04.72]I wasn't dumb enough to drink it, though.
[285:07.42]You tried, guys.
[285:08.42]Never learn.
[285:09.26]Not supposed to say this, but I think the flowers will help you out.
[285:12.20]This guy's going to make me eat flowers and I'm going to get even more poisoned.
[285:15.00]Look for them in the rocks along the northern shoreline.
[285:18.34]Ugh.
[285:19.83]Hey, you put your blind trust in that other person.
[285:21.67]Please put your blind trust in me.
[285:23.03]I'm gonna be even more worse off.
[285:27.60]Here we go.
[285:34.12]Alright, I'm good.
[285:39.37]Drive the boat to get the antidote.
[285:44.49]This is a strange boat.
[285:45.55]A pod raiser.
[285:48.79]Oh, Spencer, you're taking off?
[285:51.45]Bye, Spencer.
[285:52.67]Thanks for sticking around, Spencer.
[285:55.51]Yeah, after I get this next save point here, we're going to end the stream.
[285:58.33]Pick up tomorrow.
[285:59.91]We'll try to go a little bit longer tomorrow.
[286:06.68]Try to get closer to the end of the game.
[286:07.98]Because I'm kind of just doing DLC right now.
[286:12.04]I want that.
[286:13.06]Is it?
[286:13.50]No, give me that.
[286:14.10]Give me that.
[286:14.38]It's a real statue.
[286:15.28]I'm not going to die, right?
[286:16.18]I don't think I will.
[286:23.29]I can't move that fast, so I'm just going to do this.
[286:25.13]There we go!
[286:26.21]Get in.
[286:30.01]Am I going to do the major DLCs?
[286:42.70]Isn't this one of the major DLCs?
[286:48.66]I thought this was one of the major parts of the downloadable content.
[287:00.12]Get the antidote.
[287:07.60]Speedrun strats.
[287:09.54]Do the link roll.
[287:12.46]Am I going to do all the major DLCs?
[287:16.02]I don't know if I'll do every DLC that's available.
[287:19.39]I made it back.
[287:33.59]Get to the arena.
[287:35.59]Alright, um... Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[287:38.62]Let's just start.
[287:39.12]We're gonna... Tomorrow night, we'll start... And we'll go from here.
[287:45.16]Save it right here.
[287:51.76]Did I get any new upgrades?
[287:53.19]Yes, I do, actually.
[287:57.19]Well, this is a pretty good place to figure this out.
[287:59.41]Charge kick follow... Unlocks a quick follow-up to the basic heavy thrust kick.
[288:03.94]Cool.
[288:05.40]I think I want this.
[288:09.24]Yeah.
[288:11.22]I'm in a tournament where I get punched and kicked.
[288:13.20]Might as well do it.
[288:17.35]Save it again.
[288:19.11]Alright.
[288:20.75]Thanks everyone for sticking around.
[288:21.71]We're going to do the credits and the bits.
[288:25.25]Because last night we went well into like one or two o'clock in the morning and I want to not do that.
[288:32.86]Five hours is a pretty good
[288:35.43]length just don't want to keep people up past like two o'clock in the morning we were up late last night but tomorrow's Friday so there's not much that's not that big of a deal but it still is though you know it still is let's head to the credits thanks everybody for subbing all the resubs and all the new subs here they are let's read them quick like you know I can thanks everybody

[291:09.27]It's not that hard.
[291:09.87]It is.
[291:10.15]It is when people have... Look, okay.
[291:11.66]When I have to read a name that's like this, right?
[291:44.71]There's like no capitals and no punctuate.
[291:47.29]You know what I mean?
[291:47.77]It's like, that's like the one, like you can't read that.
[291:55.43]And yeah, some of them I'm just bumbling through, but all lowercase, no capitalizations.
[292:04.69]And that's why my name is superior.
[292:13.40]It was the one-eyed red ninja.
[292:17.72]Well, yeah.
[292:21.41]To be fair, was it on the list?
[292:24.39]That's why capitals.
[292:28.91]Yeah, it's a string of characters at some point.
[292:33.70]Oh, he forgets his goddamn fans.
[292:37.76]Burn him!
[292:45.10]Your name is nice and simple.
[292:46.27]No.
[292:47.77]Alright.
[292:49.13]Let's get to the bits.
[292:50.09]No, not that.
[292:50.87]This.
[292:54.92]And plus, also remember, I'm reading these on a screen that's as big as an iPhone screen.
[293:03.11]I'm on my other monitor, and my other monitor has like five windows on it.
[293:07.95]It has Twitch chat, it has Streamlabs, it has OBS.
[293:12.75]That's not like a giant projector in front of me.
[293:14.92]It's as big as an iPhone screen.
[293:17.14]Reading that.
[293:19.10]Because I have it set up where there's a bunch of windows, and they'll have to be sized accordingly.
[293:24.12]My other monitor is like a 22-inch monitor.
[293:26.17]It's not that big.
[293:34.78]Streaming from my phone.
[293:37.41]Get a third monitor.
[293:39.35]I know, but at some point, I was gonna get a third monitor, but I don't have any space for it.
[293:46.37]I have, like... You need, like, a gigantic workstation for three big monitors.
[293:53.70]You end up with a space station.
[294:03.12]But thanks for sticking around if you're taking off.
[294:05.22]Hopefully I'll see you tomorrow.
[294:08.18]And let's do the bits!
[294:12.77]Screaming on a calculator.
[294:13.79]Yeah, some calculators are really good, though.
[294:16.47]Sometimes you forget.
[294:17.19]Hey, StixRenegade, thanks for the $1, Stix.
[294:20.97]A billion, 400 billion.
[294:22.81]Which is six Jerma Expensives.
[294:27.81]How many people... I wanna even... I'm curious.
[294:29.63]How many people actually have Jerma Expensive?
[294:33.68]What is the actual amount of people that are subscribed with that email?
[294:38.29]Let's find out.
[294:44.05]Shut up.
[294:45.77]Nobody wants to hear you, Jeremy.
[294:49.09]Let's see.
[294:51.17]Because I see it sometimes pop up.
[294:53.52]Show me your expenses.
[294:54.96]Alright.
[295:00.04]What do we got here?
[295:02.29]There are... drumroll... There are 10 people that have the Jerma Expensive emote.
[295:13.75]10.
[295:16.05]That seems a little insane.
[295:20.51]If it's fewer than 20, I'll sub.
[295:22.55]It's 10.
[295:28.13]Streamer is obsessed with money.
[295:31.11]let's talk let's talk about money 10 idiots says the guy that has it it's funny but thank you dude also sticks renegade for a dollar says stick fax 9273
[295:53.82]Uh, Mansa Musso was the wealthiest man in history, having a total wealth of over 400 million dollars.
[296:00.00]That's the equivalent to five Jerma exp- Did I just do this?
[296:06.08]No, 400 billion!
[296:07.34]Oh, 400- Okay, 400 billion, not 400 million.
[296:10.37]400 billion dollars.
[296:12.43]Hey, the mightiest of beers, thanks for the five dollars.
[296:15.11]I've been unable to catch a stream in a while, so here's five bucks.
[296:19.33]Thanks, dude.
[296:20.35]Appreciate the five dollars, thanks a lot, man.
[296:23.25]Manboy777, thanks for the 25 cents.
[296:25.37]I'm gonna sneeze, but at some point I'm gonna... Hey, Jerma, I heard you might be streaming Nintendo Labo.
[296:31.57]Did I hear right, or was I made a fool out of?
[296:33.35]Also, do you even have a Switch?
[296:35.60]Uh, no, that answers that last question.
[296:37.68]We're gonna go backwards.
[296:38.42]So, no, I don't have a Switch.
[296:40.28]Uh, no, you were not made a fool.
[296:42.20]And yes, I'm gonna be doing a Nintendo Labo stream.
[296:45.22]So, just need to get it all.
[296:47.83]Probably next week.
[296:49.45]Hey, Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.00.
[296:52.80]I hope you feel better, Jeremy.
[296:53.72]We all really appreciate the hard work and effort you put into the streams.
[296:56.80]Maybe you could help with the hurt tummy by not drinking so much piss pre-stream.
[297:03.55]This was a headache.
[297:04.91]I had a really bad migraine.
[297:06.07]That's why I didn't start the stream at 7.
[297:08.13]I was sitting here at like 6.45.
[297:09.55]I just needed a minute for the Tylenol Advil to kick in.
[297:17.74]And it seems to have done a pretty good job because I'm okay.
[297:21.82]Why are you gonna make it wired, bro?
[297:23.48]It's just a kiss.
[297:23.98]What are you talking about?
[297:24.78]What are you talking about, man?
[297:37.54]Thank you RapidValge for the two dollars.
[297:40.88]I sent you another donation a while before that saying I had schizophrenia and having it was like Twitch chat in my brain all the time.
[297:47.97]You got all solemn and sad and for the rest of the bits you sounded down.
[297:51.33]Don't get down from our woes, please.
[297:53.95]The Twitch chat part was a joke anyway, but when we tell you about our lives, we don't want you to be sad.
[297:58.88]We want you to joke and keep being your happy self.
[298:01.30]That's what keeps us going.
[298:05.41]Yeah, I mean, that's true.
[298:09.23]That's true, but I mean, when I, when I, look, there's the thing.
[298:12.48]I'm a very, like, empathetic person.
[298:14.88]Whenever I hear about something that, something that somebody's going through, or something bad in somebody's life, I can't help it.
[298:21.83]I'm always just, it, it affects me, you know what I mean?
[298:26.95]Not negatively, you know what I mean?
[298:28.41]But it affects me.
[298:29.65]When I hear something is going on in somebody's life, I'm just like, fuck.
[298:34.72]I wish it wasn't, you know what I mean?
[298:38.98]But I do appreciate it, though.
[298:40.08]Thank you, Rapid, for the $2.
[298:41.28]And yeah, I mean, it's... This whole thing... Obviously, this environment is...
[298:53.35]I want it to be fun and... I don't want it to be negative or have anybody feel bad and shit.
[298:58.38]I want people to have fun here, you know?
[299:02.08]But I can't, like, turn off my emotions.
[299:04.06]If something's, like, bothering me... You guys have seen it before.
[299:06.58]Like, if shit bothers me, I have problems.
[299:08.66]I have things that go on.
[299:11.48]You know?
[299:12.67]We're all dynamic.
[299:13.53]We're all... Yin and yang.
[299:17.89]Positive, negative.
[299:19.81]Balance.
[299:20.99]In the force.
[299:21.41]Balance.
[299:23.16]And may the fourth be with you.
[299:24.32]Coming up soon.
[299:24.90]Next week, I'm going to be able to make that joke.
[299:27.16]And it'll be relevant again.
[299:31.46]But thanks, man.
[299:32.00]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[299:34.32]Hey, Spencer said he's working on making jermaSnort a global emote.
[299:37.40]I can't wait.
[299:37.96]I hope that's not real, but thanks.
[299:40.26]Love the new emote.
[299:43.88]Me too.
[299:44.28]Thanks.
[299:45.70]Hey, Pin, thanks for the $0.25.
[299:47.74]That was Manboy that gave that, by the way.
[299:49.35]Thank you, Pin.
[299:51.00]Hey, Jerma, I decided to go skydiving today.
[299:53.72]It was super exciting.
[299:54.54]We were up about 14,000 feet and I was just about to jump out with my instructor when I noticed there was no curvature to the planet.
[300:04.57]Weird, huh?
[300:06.17]jermaSnort.
[300:13.69]Are you like a flat earther right now?
[300:16.09]What are you talking about?
[300:20.99]Thank you.
[300:22.45]Uska for the $5.
[300:24.47]They say I-L-Y.
[300:25.59]Thanks a lot.
[300:26.11]I appreciate it.
[300:27.16]Thank you, Uska.
[300:29.12]Composition123, thanks for the $1.50.
[300:31.02]BeanbagSonic versus BicentennialMan for the next Jerma Rumble.
[300:37.52]Yeah, what an odd thing, huh?
[300:42.90]BeanbagSonic is definitely going to be in the next Rumble.
[300:44.78]That's guaranteed.
[300:45.38]BicentennialMan might have to be there, too.
[300:48.06]Write these all down.
[300:49.08]I know I am.
[300:51.15]A wild Merrill, thanks for the two bucks.
[300:53.63]Broluck, thanks for the one dollar.
[300:54.83]Hey man, I've been showing some streamers your new snort emote.
[300:57.33]They love it more than mustard.
[301:00.09]Well, Broluck, mustard is a jarring, painful to look at emote.
[301:06.94]It sucks to look at Jerm of mustard for more than five seconds.
[301:09.80]It hurts.
[301:10.12]So, you know, it doesn't surprise me.
[301:16.31]TechnoToast, thanks for the 50 cents.
[301:18.37]I love how your streams are just a collection of weird noises.
[301:21.75]Like this.
[301:31.81]What the fuck happened there?
[301:35.74]Oh, it's because I thought I was gonna... Okay, yeah.
[301:37.88]I see.
[301:38.24]I get it.
[301:38.64]Yep.
[301:43.76]I'm like a super high-strung neurotic person.
[301:46.12]So when something... When I get thrown a curveball, or when something goes not according to my exact plan, it's like energy has to just come out somewhere.
[301:56.10]Out of my mouth, out of my nose, out of my ass.
[301:57.41]You know what I mean?
[301:58.25]Energy just comes out of me.
[302:01.07]I don't know how to stop it.
[302:04.35]Thank you to an Adam for the 50 cents.
[302:07.89]Thank you, an Adam, with another Twitch clip.
[302:09.39]Let's see what this is.
[302:14.32]That's Snoopy.
[302:15.18]I can't tell.
[302:15.60]Was that Snoopy?
[302:16.98]That's what I heard.
[302:18.36]I didn't hear anything else besides Snoopy.
[302:20.62]Thanks, man.
[302:23.82]Dunkey Arisen, thanks for the $1 Jerma.
[302:25.50]You're my favorite Twitch on stream.
[302:28.14]Or on Twitch.
[302:29.60]This is like my 10th time donating to you.
[302:31.76]And I can't thank you enough.
[302:33.36]I think I'll always remember the moment when you let a colony of angry fire ants up your urethra.
[302:37.80]Thanks.
[302:38.20]Keep on truckin', buddy.
[302:45.12]That's a call back to last night.
[302:48.10]And I read it, so thanks a lot, man.
[302:50.52]Appreciate the money that you've given me over the last at least six months.
[302:58.96]Thank you, dude.
[303:01.08]Why do you read that you read for bits?
[303:03.96]Because I have no self-control.
[303:05.82]Energy just comes out.
[303:07.06]We just talked about it.
[303:10.12]I skip some.
[303:11.64]Like, sometimes someone will send bits, and it's like, I'm not gonna read that.
[303:16.36]I might just skip over it entirely.
[303:17.92]It might just be inappropriate, whether they're trying to get me to do something or say something.
[303:22.22]I'm not that person, you know what I mean?
[303:24.28]I'm not that kind of guy.
[303:24.96]You know what I'm saying?
[303:28.93]Gotta be careful.
[303:30.45]Thank you, Geradin, for the 40 cents.
[303:32.25]Apparently the requirement of getting the Just Cause 2 outfit is having a Just Cause 2 save file detected on the computer.
[303:42.03]I'd look into that.
[303:44.83]Uh, the 13th Onion, thanks for the $1.
[303:47.15]Hey, I love sleep dogs.
[303:48.23]You're playing a game I like.
[303:49.25]Have money.
[303:52.06]I... This is by far one of my favorite open world drive-around games that I've played besides GTA.
[303:59.70]That's for sure.
[304:02.40]And it makes sense because the true crime games were equally as fun and wild.
[304:07.96]It really is too bad that I'm not going to be able to experience...
[304:11.61]And here's the thing, true crime versus something like Saints Row.
[304:15.93]I don't like Saints Row.
[304:17.56]I feel like Saints Row is crazy and insane to be crazy and insane for the sake of being crazy and insane.
[304:24.00]Like, crazy shit happens in true crime and in these games.
[304:28.58]But it's not necessarily intentional.
[304:31.66]Saints Row is like a bunch of intentional look at how crazy we are in quotes.
[304:36.75]I'm not like, I don't know.
[304:40.31]The World of... It wasn't always like that.
[304:46.17]Like, Saints Row... The first two were pretty good.
[304:50.23]But then once it got to, like, a Saints Row 3, Saints Row 4, it's almost like they were kind of making fun of their own game.
[304:55.45]And decided just to put, like, fucking superpowers in and shit.
[304:58.63]And it was just, like, a big joke.
[304:59.99]Like, hilarious, funny game game.
[305:02.19]Yeah.
[305:07.02]I wasn't a big fan of 3 and 4.
[305:10.32]The first two, I did enjoy a lot.
[305:17.06]But, yeah.
[305:17.50]And then they made that other game that, like, who the fuck even played it?
[305:20.95]Like, Mayhem Men?
[305:23.61]Mystery... The Mayhem of Mystery Men?
[305:25.53]Mayhem City?
[305:26.15]What the hell was it called?
[305:26.91]It was just Saints Row, but, like, with Overwatch characters?
[305:31.25]That game looked awful.
[305:33.71]What the hell was it called?
[305:37.40]Agents of Mayhem.
[305:38.14]That's what it was.
[305:41.15]There's 900 people here.
[305:42.43]Did anyone play Agents of Mayhem in this entire chat?
[305:46.27]One person.
[305:47.47]And can you give it a score from 1 to 10?
[305:56.55]I'm curious if anyone played it.
[306:00.96]Didn't even know it came out.
[306:01.92]3 out of 10.
[306:08.98]1 out of 10, 3 out of 10, no one.
[306:12.50]You didn't even hear about that until now.
[306:16.80]You see, that's just how potentially stupid that game was.
[306:23.29]But, regardless.
[306:26.19]Yeah, the True Crime series...
[306:30.33]has been an absolute joy and it's sad to know that the studio doesn't really do this anymore they got like liquidated right how long do I have this bit emote thing next to my name uh forever that's to show how much money you've given this channel so there's you'll have a you've given this channel a dollar so it'll be there forever I think you can turn you can turn it off
[306:56.95]Right?
[306:57.11]You can disable that from showing up next to your name.
[306:59.21]If you really want to.
[307:00.69]It just shows how much money you've given the channel over the last... I think forever, right?
[307:07.84]I've given $3.
[307:08.24]You've given $3 like times a thousand.
[307:17.61]But anyways, uh, Rogue Fort, thanks for the 25 cents.
[307:19.63]Hey, Jerma, today I got one that will really make you snort.
[307:23.31]Owls of G'huul for the Xbox 360.
[307:26.81]It's a real piece of shit, but in a good way.
[307:29.79]The Jerma kind of shit, if you know what I mean.
[307:32.12]I hope you like owls, because that's what you're getting, you beautiful bastard.
[307:35.14]Hope to see you in the middle of the forest real soon.
[307:37.00]What the fuck?
[307:41.20]Thanks, dude.
[307:42.64]I'll give it a look.
[307:44.46]I've got to get a list, man, of just all these games people have requested.
[307:48.28]There's a lot of them.
[307:50.44]Hey, Broluck again gave $3.
[307:51.86]$4 here.
[307:52.68]Let's see what he says.
[307:56.93]One is a Twitch clip.
[308:01.13]It's me pushing the guy out of the way to pee in his... Alright, it's me pissing.
[308:07.47]Good clip.
[308:09.67]And then, uh... This police officer is so fucking corrupt, stealing cars for money, committing insurance fraud for complete strangers on the side of the road, punching and kicking random people on the street because it's therapeutic, driving on the wrong side of the road constantly, property damage amounting to billions of dollars, destroying police cars.
[308:27.14]Oh, he's just listing off a bunch of awful things I've done.
[308:30.76]Alright, well, thanks bro.
[308:35.47]And me, underscore, thank you for the two dollars here total.
[308:39.98]Drunken Warrior wins.
[308:41.14]PogChamp, thank you so much for playing as the Drunken Warrior, Jerma.
[308:44.32]Party 100.
[308:44.76]And then they say this game was made for me.
[308:47.94]I think this game was made for a lot of people.
[308:52.75]But thank you.
[308:54.61]Broluck says, part of his $4 here, Kim Jong-un just crossed over to South Korea to start peace talks.
[309:01.87]This is huge.
[309:03.43]Did he really?
[309:06.71]Really?
[309:07.65]Is that actually happening?
[309:10.30]I was always under the impression that they had some kind of device setup where if it detected his DNA, like, he would explode or something if he crossed the border.
[309:19.07]I was assuming there'd be something crazy like that.
[309:22.37]Like, he steps foot over the border and it's like... Somebody, like, implanted, like, syringe, like, with nanomachines in his juice or something.
[309:29.43]Apparently not.
[309:32.90]He crossed the border and took pictures.
[309:36.62]Holy shit, well... There you go.
[309:42.20]would be great you know that would be great if there wasn't a conflict over there forever I hope it works out hey GarfieldTheMondayKiller thanks for the 25 cents here comes Garfield oh here he comes yo jerv I've come to ask you again about yesterday's question what series would you give their own universe or movie series to
[310:08.99]Well, here we go.
[310:10.61]Didn't I say... I thought I said it.
[310:14.20]Chrono Trigger.
[310:17.28]Chrono Trigger deserves more than it got.
[310:21.32]I don't care if it's TV show, movie... And here's the crazy thing.
[310:24.28]Akira Toriyama made those... Remember they did the PlayStation 1 remaster of Chrono Trigger?
[310:31.67]And Akira Toriyama made a bunch of animated cutscenes...
[310:37.45]What the fuck happened with that?
[310:39.31]How amazing would that have been to get a Chrono Trigger animated anime?
[310:45.19]Do you like money?
[310:47.18]Would you like money?
[310:47.80]Because that's what it is.
[310:48.80]You'd make a lot of it.
[310:51.62]It's too bad.
[310:53.22]But regardless, I would say I would love to see something like that.
[311:00.13]Animated anime.
[311:02.59]What movie deserves its own video game?
[311:06.03]Um... What movie or series deserves their own video game?
[311:15.63]Hmm.
[311:18.07]I don't know.
[311:19.75]That's another hard one.
[311:22.77]I probably could answer this question at some point in my life.
[311:27.55]But I feel like movies are very standalone.
[311:29.43]And a lot of movies have already been brought over.
[311:32.73]In their own way.
[311:33.51]Like you could say, oh man, the Godfather was... No, that's like the Mafia series.
[311:37.23]And they did Godfather games.
[311:39.43]What about Scarface?
[311:40.27]No, they made a Scarface game.
[311:42.18]Hmm.
[311:42.94]Okay, well then.
[311:47.40]John Wick?
[311:48.56]Yeah, but John Wick would just be one of these games.
[311:50.50]It would be like a true crime game.
[311:51.98]Although it would be fun.
[311:59.04]I don't know, that's a hard one.
[312:00.24]I can't really think about it right now, but thank you, Garfield.
[312:04.86]Uh, Hawkeye of mine, thanks for the $1.
[312:06.64]Those monks are the deacons of the orchid.
[312:10.21]Of the black orchid.
[312:12.49]When I stole the orchid and I ate it and got poisoned.
[312:16.09]Well, that happens like an hour later.
[312:17.27]Never mind.
[312:18.33]Hey, Nightfang!
[312:19.01]Thanks for the $1, NightfangX7.
[312:20.19]Hey, Dermasar, for not being around in today's stream.
[312:23.51]I was too busy writing three English papers for my bitch of an English teacher.
[312:28.36]I'm just so glad that this semester ends next week and I can go into hyper sleep for the summer.
[312:33.14]I used to love that so much.
[312:35.82]Getting all your final work done and knowing that it's gonna be at least three or four months or like at least three months before you have to really do much.
[312:46.64]Oh, it's such a fantastic feeling.
[312:50.57]Sounds like you really like your English teacher.
[312:55.03]But she's doing it because she's trying to make you a better person.
[313:00.47]There's a lot of mean teachers that I had over the years and then I thought about it and I'm sitting there going...
[313:05.23]You know, they needed to be like that.
[313:07.75]They had to be mean English teachers, mean science teachers.
[313:12.41]No nonsense.
[313:13.37]Discipline.
[313:14.23]And it was like, shut the fuck up.
[313:16.37]You're an idiot.
[313:17.23]I'm so cool.
[313:18.07]I don't want to listen to this.
[313:18.91]But then over the, I'm 32 now, right?
[313:23.52]I probably would say and do a lot of the shit that those teachers did to children or to teenagers.
[313:30.41]you start to get it once you get past like 25 30 you start to get it that maybe throwing a crayon across the room to hit your friend in the face wasn't you know that great thing to do and you should have been corrected for it you know maybe watching the guy in science class pull the shower every day because he thought it was funny and then the teacher came in and screamed every day and you laughed maybe that you know maybe that's not that funny
[314:02.29]I mean, it kind of is.
[314:03.63]But it's not.
[314:04.35]That's not funny.
[314:06.85]Do you guys have those, remember the science room showers?
[314:11.38]It was a thing you pulled, it was like an emergency lever you pulled, and water would come down.
[314:17.54]In case somebody got lime on their hands or something, or on their face.
[314:24.61]There was a guy in my science class that pulled it every day.
[314:28.99]And then he would sit down, and the teacher would come in, and it would be just like, you know, nobody, who, what are you gonna do?
[314:35.12]You gonna rat him out?
[314:37.38]There's way more consequences there.
[314:43.17]He would come in and just be like, Jesus Christ.
[314:46.87]Really?
[314:47.89]Really, you think it's this funny?
[314:50.29]It's funny to waste resources, isn't it?
[314:52.55]It's funny, you know, very funny.
[314:57.55]I remember one time, the same person.
[315:01.33]You know how classrooms are set up where there's a, you know, hallway and then a bunch of classrooms.
[315:06.20]Some of them are across from each other.
[315:08.92]So you have a hallway with, you know, math and then directly across the next side of the hall is science.
[315:15.25]And then keep going, keep going.
[315:16.53]Alright, another math class.
[315:18.13]I don't know, an English class.
[315:19.17]Keep going, keep going.
[315:19.91]So you could see into another classroom if you really wanted to.
[315:22.51]So what would happen sometimes is...
[315:25.93]This guy was sitting in a perfect spot.
[315:28.20]So, in the science room,
[315:31.15]could look out he was sitting straight ahead was the door and out was the hallway into the hallway the other door to the other classroom right and he would think this was hilarious he would get a marker and maybe once every like few weeks once every month or two while the teacher wasn't paying attention turned away to the blackboard he would throw a marker out of our classroom into the hall into the other classroom and then just put his head down on his desk
[315:59.66]And it would be like, how the fuck are you supposed to know who this is?
[316:04.91]It's like, how the fuck are you supposed to know who, what?
[316:08.01]The teacher would come in and be like, would look around the hallway freaking out.
[316:11.03]Like, what's, it was the perfect crime.
[316:16.14]It was just like, what is, and I sat near this person.
[316:20.90]So I was just like, dude, I'm going to get in trouble.
[316:22.54]Like, they're going to think I did this and I never did it.
[316:25.32]It's like, this guy was like pulling fucking showers, throwing crayons.
[316:28.81]So yes, long story short, teachers need to be disciplined.
[316:33.11]No, no, teachers need to discipline.
[316:38.91]Because there's kids like that that exist.
[316:42.20]That are whipping fucking markers into the hallway in other classes.
[316:50.44]Why did Jerma do that?
[316:52.36]I didn't.
[316:53.16]I was not a menace.
[316:54.08]I was not a school menace.
[317:06.68]Anyways.
[317:08.22]Did you hear?
[317:08.66]What was your question?
[317:09.52]Oh, yeah.
[317:09.84]It was not.
[317:10.22]It was about English papers and taking the summer off.
[317:13.20]Get some good rest, buddy.
[317:14.46]For real.
[317:15.26]You deserve it.
[317:16.74]Thank you, Son of Chernobyl, for the $1.
[317:18.10]Hi, non-native English speaker here.
[317:20.72]Do hair and hair sound exactly the same?
[317:24.07]That sucks.
[317:25.79]Yes.
[317:27.61]Unfortunately, it's like there and there.
[317:31.25]Hair and hair.
[317:33.69]There's a bunch of others.
[317:36.05]There's like rock and rock.
[317:39.79]One of them's music.
[317:41.11]One of them is a big stone.
[317:43.25]English is very strange.
[317:45.35]Yes.
[317:45.83]Everything... Here's the thing about English versus... English is a contextual language.
[317:51.56]So everything requires context.
[317:55.00]And a lot of language are very literal.
[317:56.82]There's no contextual language in some other languages.
[318:01.33]So, unfortunately, when I say the word hair, you need to know contextually what I'm talking about because English is one of those languages.
[318:07.31]So, sorry that you have to... That sucks, yes.
[318:14.64]Hey, Zmanreal, thanks for the 25 cents.
[318:17.96]Use the grenade launcher.
[318:18.80]There is none.
[318:22.48]They're talking about words being spelled differently.
[318:25.34]No, they said they sound exactly the same.
[318:27.24]What do you mean being spelled differently?
[318:31.34]This is not about spelling.
[318:33.17]This, um, excuse me.
[318:36.03]No, I don't want to give bits.
[318:38.61]Excuse me, can we just go ahead and take a look at what they said?
[318:43.91]Stop putting the cheer.
[318:44.92]If I copy and cheer, it's like, you can't cheer on your own channel.
[318:48.90]It's like, fuck off, I don't want to cheer.
[318:54.78]It's not about what it was spelled like.
[318:57.43]I will make sure you guys can read it.
[318:58.79]Because it was a while ago.
[319:02.99]it is do they sound exactly the same do they sound the same not how they're spelled I'm the teacher here and I'm going to discipline hey thank you co2 shelby for the one dollar thanks for the uh one dollar a mango sharpie thanks for the one dollar Jerma buys a switch to play with cardboard that's what's gonna happen

[319:32.19]More coffee pasting.
[319:39.53]Hair?
[319:42.59]Thank you, Graveyard Ghoul, for the five dollars.
[319:44.70]You probably already knew this, but when your face meter is full, grapplers won't counter you.
[319:49.04]Making environmental kills the easiest way to deal with them quickly.
[319:52.12]That's if you want to.
[319:54.04]Yeah, I'm slowly starting to figure that out.
[319:56.60]It's gonna come in handy.
[319:58.26]Thanks a lot, Graveyard.
[319:59.05]Appreciate it, man.
[320:01.55]Uh, Vodkar for the $1.
[320:03.13]Thank you.
[320:03.63]Party 100.
[320:03.93]Love you, Jeremy.
[320:04.35]Love you too.
[320:06.43]13th Onion, thanks for the $1.
[320:07.55]Hey, have you checked out Majesty?
[320:09.07]I mentioned it a month ago during a Monster Rancher stream.
[320:11.33]I have not.
[320:12.42]Write it down.
[320:13.30]Get a lit- Alright.
[320:14.64]Discord.
[320:17.00]Why don't you check out the Discord while you're at it?
[320:19.06]In the Discord, I would like if you would.
[320:23.08]I don't know if you want to do this in a general chat or maybe we'll figure this out.
[320:29.46]Maybe like suggestions.
[320:31.00]You know what?
[320:31.78]Bingo.
[320:32.68]Let's just have a Discord.
[320:34.16]And then when you get in there, we're going to make a new channel.
[320:36.24]And it's going to be called Recommendations.
[320:39.41]Okay?
[320:40.43]Not right now.
[320:41.25]It's not going to be there right now.
[320:42.37]Maybe there tomorrow, maybe.
[320:44.71]But, like, recommend game recommendations or stream recommendations.
[320:48.73]Because I get a lot of them.
[320:50.41]A ton of them.
[320:51.99]And sometimes I just forget.
[320:54.57]Sometimes, you know, people bring up over the course of a week, like, five, ten different games and I'm only remembering one of them.
[321:01.24]So... We could have recommendations.
[321:07.54]Might be an interesting thing to do.
[321:10.68]It's gonna be filled with Minecraft.
[321:12.98]Uh, no it won't because it's gonna be... you're gonna have to get... if you say Minecraft, your... your character is instantly deleted in Minecraft.
[321:23.95]Isn't there a virus that was embedding itself in Minecraft skins?
[321:30.26]That's kind of insane that that's possible.
[321:36.35]But thank you 13th Onion.
[321:38.65]We'll try to get a list somehow.
[321:40.39]Even if we don't make a new room.
[321:42.41]Just maybe in general one night just have, you know, be able to get a list going.
[321:46.79]Because there's a lot of things that people have asked me to play over the last year or two.
[321:51.45]Samuel Sish, thanks for the $1.
[321:52.53]Jerma expensive, Jerma expensive.
[321:54.88]Fewer than 20 of us.
[321:56.90]I'm not a liar.
[322:00.52]Fewer than 20.
[322:00.98]Join, join the cult.
[322:06.36]Thank you, Sam.
[322:08.90]Yeah, the Earth is flat, by the way.
[322:10.24]Haha.
[322:12.16]Dr. Clay 999, thanks for the 25 cents.
[322:14.12]Whenever I see the jermaSnort, I keep seeing Gene Wilder.
[322:18.83]I can see that.
[322:20.67]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[322:22.19]Hey, Jerma, I've been playing the new God of War this past week, and it's a lot of fun.
[322:25.43]Stopping you right there.
[322:26.79]Gonna be playing it.
[322:27.55]And I'm probably gonna stream it.
[322:28.81]So... Yeah.
[322:31.51]I've heard it's absolutely, absolutely phenomenal.
[322:34.74]I heard it's extraordinarily challenging.
[322:37.48]I'm gonna play it.
[322:39.54]Absolutely.
[322:42.47]We'll see.
[322:43.49]No, no, no, not we'll see.
[322:44.43]Yes, I am.
[322:45.77]But thanks a lot, man.
[322:46.35]Thanks for the $1, dude.
[322:49.17]It's got, like, Bloodborne kind of combat.
[322:50.89]It's very challenging, almost like Dark Souls-y combat with enemies, but not a whole lot of bosses, I've been told.
[322:57.70]There's some puzzles in there, though, and you guys are gonna have to help me on those because I have trouble with those ones.
[323:02.28]And I beat The Last Guardian on stream.
[323:04.28]Cool it.
[323:06.41]Actual dragon tears.
[323:07.31]Thanks for the $1.
[323:08.67]First time ever giving bits, so not sure if I'm doing it right.
[323:11.65]Anyways, Jermo, love you, man.
[323:12.63]I'm going to write my paper now.
[323:14.95]Good luck, dragon.
[323:17.59]No, it's not.
[323:19.34]Dark Souls of War.
[323:21.04]It's just like Dark Souls.
[323:24.64]No, no, no.
[323:33.31]Only four bosses.
[323:34.17]That's alright, though.
[323:40.01]That's fine.
[323:42.06]I heard dragon and looked up.
[323:43.60]Huh?
[323:47.88]God of War.
[323:48.92]Guild.
[323:50.02]Gears of War.
[323:50.82]Guilds of War.
[323:51.56]How many G.O.W.'
[323:52.63]'s are there?
[323:54.69]Guild Wars.
[323:56.29]Okay.
[323:56.55]There's a lot of G.O.W.'s.
[323:58.17]I'm sorry.
[323:58.65]But like when I see G.O.W.
[324:00.45]God of War.
[324:01.63]Guild of Wars.
[324:03.64]Uh.
[324:04.08]Gar.
[324:05.20]What's another G.O.W.
[324:06.04]game?
[324:15.91]Gears of War.
[324:24.85]Gary the Gull.
[324:31.50]Gary the Gull.
[324:33.64]That's G-T-G.
[324:35.06]Sorry, man.
[324:37.95]Game of Warcraft.
[324:39.41]Game of Waluigi.
[324:41.33]Guy obtains wrench.
[324:45.99]Hey, thanks a lot.
[324:47.33]Appreciate it.
[324:48.25]Appreciate the money you gave me.
[324:49.48]Thanks a lot for the money.
[324:50.76]Moon.
[324:52.20]Moon unit.
[324:52.96]Thanks for the $1.
[324:53.40]Could you do another bike joke, please?
[324:55.96]Alright.
[325:13.44]There are no bikes here.
[325:14.18]We're on the beach.
[325:20.18]Sorry, guys.
[325:22.60]Get that off the screen.
[325:25.47]I thought that was the Bicentennial Man, not NRG.
[325:30.59]Oh, well.
[325:33.89]We were doing something over here.
[325:35.19]We were doing bits.
[325:38.57]Thank you, Moon, for the $1 bill.
[325:40.11]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $0.80.
[325:41.23]Just wanted to pitch another $0.80 to make it a full dollar.
[325:45.73]It isn't much, but I just wanted to say thanks for all your streams and past content.
[325:49.16]It's really helped fight me.
[325:50.46]It's really helped me through a lot.
[325:53.62]Truth be told, I don't think Jerm of mustard isn't so bad.
[325:55.64]The only problem is that there was too much yellow and not enough zigzag.
[325:59.12]If you wanted a lightning bolt, go get some food.
[326:04.26]Yeah, but I wasn't ever supposed to upload it.
[326:07.09]This was never supposed to be uploaded.
[326:09.85]I was peer pressured by chat in an after the stream hangout stream to upload it immediately.
[326:18.06]It could have used a lot of refinements, but now I'm going to be... People are going to get angry if I do anything to it, right?
[326:25.06]That's how it works.
[326:26.41]Terrible thing that people forced me to do.
[326:29.61]And now that it's here, I can't take it away.
[326:31.71]Otherwise, we riot.
[326:33.83]You know what I mean?
[326:34.41]Otherwise, mustard or riot, right?
[326:38.84]peer pressure.
[326:41.50]Yeah, I know.
[326:41.96]You were there.
[326:42.34]You were one of the people that peer pressured me.
[326:44.07]So you know exactly what you're talking about.
[326:46.87]You know exactly what this means.
[326:51.59]It's our emote now.
[326:53.87]Yes, it is.
[326:54.85]And you can keep it.
[326:58.30]Absolutely.
[326:58.66]Thank you though, Dr. Clay.
[326:59.46]Appreciate it, man.
[327:02.30]As always, I'm happy to help.
[327:08.31]I'm glad you can have fun here.
[327:10.55]Thanks, dude.
[327:12.04]Apples are good, thanks for the $1.
[327:13.70]Jerma, do you eat your veggies?
[327:14.82]I actually had like four radishes yesterday, so yes.
[327:17.80]Superman9501, thanks for the $0.25.
[327:20.95]I think they were developing Sleeping Dogs 2 when they closed down as a company.
[327:26.19]That sucks.
[327:27.65]Because what a great game this is.
[327:30.89]Manboy777, thanks for the 25 cents.
[327:33.63]Please tell chat to shush so BBS can make his super ultra-jupe.
[327:39.39]jermaMustard.
[327:42.75]I mean... I'm gonna assume that we're gonna get a BBS emote.
[327:48.35]Right?
[327:51.87]I'm gonna lay down... We do the emote contest.
[327:53.57]I'm gonna lay down a lot of ground rules.
[327:57.26]No... Memes are not allowed as an emote.
[328:03.34]BBS is not a meme.
[328:07.82]But there's not... I'm going to be very, very clear.
[328:11.25]We're going to have the 10 commandments of the emote contest that you're going to have to read.
[328:19.83]But thanks, man.
[328:20.23]Thank you, 13thOnion, for the $1.
[328:21.35]Did I really type sleep dogs in my earlier bit donation?
[328:24.15]I feel dumb.
[328:25.33]That's what I get for using my iPhone to donate.
[328:29.57]Autocorrect always is always screwing me.
[328:32.26]Always.
[328:35.64]I got so... Here's a quick little story about autocorrect and, you know, we'll talk about it.
[328:41.74]I get infuriated.
[328:43.52]I'll try to write like dog and it won't let me do it.
[328:46.54]Yeah.
[328:47.10]Keeps turning into T. Yeah.
[328:49.22]No.
[328:49.52]Delete.
[328:50.52]A. No.
[328:51.32]Delete it.
[328:52.14]Y-E-A.
[328:53.22]T. No.
[328:53.96]Delete it.
[328:54.80]Y-E-A.
[328:55.62]T. Delete it.
[328:57.62]I... It drives me insane.
[329:00.37]It takes me like five minutes sometimes to respond to somebody.
[329:03.69]But...
[329:05.12]I turned it off.
[329:07.42]I turned off autocorrect.
[329:08.56]And if you've ever done that and you use your phone or your iPad to type a lot of shit, you, this is what it ends up happening.
[329:15.37]This is what happens.
[329:16.65]Here's one sentence with autocorrect.
[329:25.68]Okay.
[329:27.12]Here's that same sentence without autocorrect.
[329:40.44]That was happening way more often than I ever imagined.
[329:48.32]Turn it off.
[329:48.78]Try it.
[329:49.81]Turn autocorrect off for a week and you see how awful it is.
[329:57.89]You'll see.
[329:59.81]Yeah, everyone's like talking shit right now.
[330:02.96]Turn off autocorrect.
[330:04.96]And hit up one of your friends and just start typing.
[330:08.38]See what happens.
[330:13.76]I've had autocorrect off for a year.
[330:16.78]I don't have autocorrect.
[330:17.80]I can type just fine.
[330:19.22]Oh, go Kenya.
[330:21.32]Oh, really?
[330:23.42]Really?
[330:26.64]Oh, really?
[330:37.71]Caught in the act.
[330:40.54]How do I turn off automobile correct?
[330:44.52]That was the joke?
[330:45.46]See, when I... Okay, hold on.
[330:47.24]When I do shit like that... No, you're just a fucking idiot.
[330:51.15]There's no way.
[330:51.81]You're so stupid.
[330:52.71]But when somebody else does it... No, it's just a joke.
[330:55.53]It's just a joke, man.
[330:57.23]That was the joke.
[330:58.09]Whoa, whoosh.
[330:58.89]Way over your head, huh?
[331:08.28]Turn off autocorrect for a week.
[331:09.58]Come back to me next week.
[331:17.58]Back off the mic, you don't tell me what to do.
[331:22.90]I was really pretending.
[331:23.88]Alright, let's keep going.
[331:28.52]I actually don't, didn't have autocorrect on.
[331:30.48]I think I just missed some letters.
[331:39.59]I have huge hands?
[331:41.85]I do have big hands.
[331:44.43]I'm serious.
[331:46.24]Shake my fucking hand in real life and you'll feel like the meat.
[331:49.54]You know what I mean?
[331:50.58]I got a firm handshake too.
[331:51.74]Anybody, you have some of you guys that are here that went to meetups?
[331:54.28]How like firm and meaty is that handshake?
[331:56.64]It's fucking real.
[331:57.60]Bang!
[331:57.90]You know what I mean?
[331:58.38]It's good.
[331:59.42]It's got, that handshake says confidence.
[332:02.02]It says power.
[332:04.42]I got these meaty fucking big bony hands.
[332:15.16]I do.
[332:17.40]But anyways, only like two, three left.
[332:18.86]Thank you.
[332:19.32]Apples are good for the $1.
[332:21.91]Green veggies are good for you.
[332:22.99]It's always pushing people out of your way while they piss.
[332:25.83]I mean, I agree with the first part, not the second part.
[332:30.79]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[332:31.93]Speaking of recommendations, you might like this old game I used to play called Genome.
[332:36.83]It's back in the days of Windows 95, but I have gotten to run with Windows 10 despite some visual glitches.
[332:43.27]Not sure if those are fixable, though they do make the game unplayable.
[332:47.54]They do not make the game unplayable.
[332:48.86]It's an old mech shooting game.
[332:50.34]The controls are wonky, but I would give it a shot.
[332:52.72]It was made by 7th Level, a company long lost in the shadow of game companies.
[332:59.32]I remember, um... MechWarrior.
[333:03.08]I used to play MechWarrior 2.
[333:05.34]Every day.
[333:06.26]When I was like 13 years old.
[333:09.04]It was great.
[333:10.60]If it's anything like MechWarrior, I would probably play it.
[333:16.92]But, thanks dude.
[333:17.50]Appreciate the recommendation.
[333:19.78]Uh, Rogue Fort.
[333:21.00]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[333:22.00]I like the idea of recommendation channel in the Discord.
[333:25.62]But it would not be rude.
[333:27.40]But would it not be rude for me to go in and resend all the games I've already suggested?
[333:31.17]No.
[333:31.59]No.
[333:32.85]Absolutely not.
[333:34.81]I have more in the pipeline for later streams.
[333:36.60]Should I just send them through the Discord instead?
[333:38.48]A dilemma indeed.
[333:39.48]What do you think, Jermo?
[333:41.34]No, I mean, it'll just be like an open channel.
[333:45.28]Might be interesting to be set up like straw polls and stuff.
[333:48.80]Maybe people can get in there and talk about, you know, things that they ever wanted to see me play or something.
[333:54.53]It's up to you guys.
[333:56.89]I mean, we can figure it out.
[333:58.67]Sounds like an interesting idea, though, because there are a lot of recommendations.
[334:02.61]But thanks, dude.
[334:04.26]We'll figure that out over the next week, I would say.
[334:05.74]Thank you, TechnoToast with the 50 cents right at the end here.
[334:07.70]I, for one, love Jerma985.
[334:09.06]He's my favorite streamer with big, meaty claws.
[334:12.06]Thanks, man.
[334:13.32]And last, but certainly not least, the 13th Onion just came in here with $10.
[334:17.50]And they said, I actually didn't have autocorrect on.
[334:22.51]I just missed some letters.
[334:27.19]But autocorrect would have corrected that for you.
[334:33.50]Thanks, dude.
[334:33.94]Thank you for the ten bucks.
[334:35.40]And then some over the last five hours.
[334:42.30]What about my bits?
[334:43.20]Where are they?
[334:45.80]Where?
[334:49.56]I got you.
[334:50.68]You talked about the meter, the grapplers.
[334:52.28]Yeah, I got you, Graveyard.
[334:53.64]Yeah, I don't know if you stepped up for a minute.
[334:57.96]But thank you.
[334:58.86]Appreciate it.
[335:01.82]Anyways...
[335:03.94]I will see you guys tomorrow, same time, same place.
[335:12.12]We'll try to get a lot more meat and hands done.
[335:16.53]Meaty hands done tomorrow.
[335:21.47]Bye-bye, Jerma Expensive.
[335:25.99]Yeah, good night, guys.
[335:26.57]See you tomorrow.
[335:29.33]Have a good rest of your evening.
[335:30.35]Get some sleep.
[335:31.96]Take care.
[335:35.41]Thank you.
