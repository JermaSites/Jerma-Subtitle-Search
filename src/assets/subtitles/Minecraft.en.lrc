[07:20.46]What mansion?
[07:22.12]What are you talking about?
[07:22.90]There's no mansion here.
[07:27.66]We're going to build a house right now out of dirt.
[07:29.93]Who cares?
[07:32.39]Nobody's played this game in... What is that?
[07:40.85]Is this rare?
[07:43.98]How is this rare?
[07:51.19]What is this giant?
[07:56.20]Why is this here?
[07:57.90]Notch, what are you doing?
[07:59.84]Why did you give this to me?
[08:01.10]There's a mansion here.
[08:03.16]Do I have to go in here and kill everybody in here?
[08:08.69]How do I put stuff down?
[08:13.89]Alright, I want my house to be over here.
[08:25.87]How do I slow down?
[08:29.93]Is that rare?

[08:37.41]Shift?
[08:37.69]This is PS4, dude.
[08:41.30]I need a fucking wooden axe.
[08:42.84]I'm not going in there yet.
[08:45.80]That's extremely rare.
[08:47.30]I've never seen one.
[08:48.90]Well, I...
[08:54.80]There's a 1 in 1,000 chance.
[08:57.76]Who gives a shit?
[09:08.90]Let me make my little dog shithouse over here.
[09:10.99]This is a... Let's be real.
[09:18.77]You want to be real?
[09:20.53]What a fantastic fucking game.

[09:26.81]This game sucks.
[09:29.01]I hate this game.
[09:30.21]Nothing about it is fun.
[09:32.63]I fucking hate this game.
[09:34.25]It's the worst game of 2012.
[09:35.19]Whenever the fuck this dumb shitty game came out, who cares?
[09:47.92]Did I get 500 more viewers?
[09:49.16]I did not.
[09:51.58]Oh my god, I did.
[09:52.90]Why?
[09:53.24]There's fucking 500 more people here.
[09:56.10]Why are you here?
[09:56.86]You saw Minecraft.
[09:58.98]Look, let me apologize.
[10:01.84]Let me apologize.
[10:03.90]For the 600 new people that are here.
[10:07.90]This is great.
[10:08.58]It's a fun game.
[10:09.50]It's a revolutionized fucking multiplayer video game.
[10:12.74]It did.
[10:22.19]This game revolutionized multiplayer social experiments.
[10:29.18]I'm sorry I'm the fucking number one stream on Twitch.
[10:33.00]Who's below here right now?
[10:35.18]Go watch him.
[10:35.86]He's probably so much better.
[10:37.62]Let's see.
[10:43.43]Kingani and Spoon and Brett Ultimis.
[10:47.99]These people are much better streams than I am.
[10:51.57]They're playing Minecraft.
[10:52.85]They're having a good time.
[10:56.35]Don't watch me.
[10:56.95]Watch them instead.
[10:57.73]Alright, here we go.

[11:20.79]Now that would be bad.
[11:23.49]Go in the house?
[11:24.17]No, I need a weapon.
[11:25.45]I can't go in there without a weapon.
[11:26.51]Are you crazy?
[11:27.21]I'm not going in there without a sword.
[11:33.76]You suck at Minecraft.
[11:35.04]Come on.
[11:35.60]That's why I said go watch some of the other Minecraft streamers.
[11:39.90]I got pressured into playing this because I was too drunk to play Laila Noire.
[11:47.45]I'll make a sword.
[11:48.09]I'm making a sword.
