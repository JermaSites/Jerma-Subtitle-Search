[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.71]How are you?
[00:06.71]What's up?
[00:10.12]What's up?
[00:10.74]Hey!
[00:14.40]Somebody said, why is he doing the DLC?
[00:16.32]Yeah, I played the main game.
[00:18.22]The base game.
[00:22.25]I played it pretty much on launch.
[00:25.01]Resident Evil Village DLC.
[00:28.25]That's what is on tap tonight.
[00:37.08]Play Roblox.
[00:38.06]No.
[00:42.10]All of you people that are saying play Roblox.
[00:45.04]You want me to play Roblox.
[00:46.88]So when I go into a server, 6,000 of you will join that server and like throw rocks at me.
[00:54.67]No, I'm not, I'm not going to play it.
[00:59.49]You guys, I'm going to, you guys are all collectively going to go into the Roblox server I go into and body block push me off of a cliff.
[01:13.97]And?
[01:17.83]Maybe I'll do it one day.
[01:18.99]I don't know.
[01:19.47]No, not right now.
[01:20.11]It's Halloween.
[01:20.81]We don't mind playing Roblox on Halloween.
[01:23.39]It's Halloween in a few days.
[01:26.57]We're doing Resident Evil Village DLC.
[01:29.76]I've heard this is only a few hours.
[01:32.22]We'll see how it goes.
[01:33.92]Another couple of hours, we'll see.
[01:35.08]And if I get to the end of this and it's, you know, well, you say it's like three to four hours, but you're not accounting for the amount of time that I'm going to stop and tell you in like a 15 minute conversation about my favorite Tabasco flavor, right?
[01:52.10]It's probably going to be a little longer than that.
[01:55.89]Which, by the way, Original Red is fantastic.
[02:00.63]But I think a lot of people are sleeping on the green.
[02:03.45]It's a little thicker.
[02:04.85]It's a little more like pickled, almost like jalapeno flavor.
[02:09.99]The green is great.
[02:11.53]I think a lot of people are sleeping on it.
[02:13.62]I'm not a big fan of the Chipotle one, no.
[02:16.22]Original or green?
[02:23.20]Green looks like baby food.
[02:24.74]Doesn't taste like baby food.
[02:28.91]Will you ever do chat picks a Diablo 2 skill tree again?
[02:32.79]I don't know.
[02:35.63]On hardcore, right?
[02:36.77]That's what it was.
[02:38.59]What a weird group of streams that was.
[02:41.82]I played hardcore Diablo 2.
[02:43.56]That was weird.
[02:47.34]I don't know.
[02:49.40]Maybe.
[02:51.88]They were fun.
[02:54.39]They were fun.
[02:57.39]Let's go over a few things.
[02:59.90]So first of all, today we're streaming here.
[03:02.60]You know, until we're done.
[03:05.56]Tomorrow, we're going to be streaming at 2 p.m.
[03:09.54]I'm trying to pull the streams back because the internet problem has not been fixed.
[03:13.72]I did get in touch with the ISP and somebody is going to... The technician's going to look into it.
[03:18.16]It's going to be whatever.
[03:19.82]But at like 8 p.m.
[03:22.58]Pacific, we might run into an internet wormhole.
[03:26.06]So we're going to have to ride it out.
[03:29.22]If that happens, I'm trying to pull the streams back.
[03:31.40]And yeah, I pulled it back 30 minutes today.
[03:32.88]But I really want to get started at like 1 to 2 p.m.
[03:37.50]Permanently.
[03:38.94]Until that issue is solved.
[03:41.91]So, we'll see.
[03:44.39]Cross your fingers it doesn't happen.
[03:45.99]But somebody is looking into it.
[03:49.05]Permanently.
[03:51.62]internet wormhole I don't know like we just run into some weird route at like 8 p.m that makes my internet sometimes it's on my end sometimes it's not it's very strange I don't know guys there's just like wires and boxes that are connecting all of us I don't know it's a bunch of wires
[04:17.29]And like electrical boxes.
[04:20.22]It's pretty much magic.
[04:21.16]It pretty much is.
[04:26.16]If anybody were to ever come and conquer Earth, I'm telling you, they're going to see all this shit underground.
[04:31.51]They're going to come here for the gold.
[04:33.09]They're going to come here for the gold, but they're not going to understand what the internet is.
[04:38.19]And they're going to see all these wires in the ground and be like, yeah, dig all that up.
[04:41.09]That's not the gold.
[04:42.30]But that's what they really should have been looking for.
[04:46.71]It's the infrastructure.
[04:48.05]It's the internet, right?
[04:49.21]Our communication ability.
[04:50.25]And they're just going to go for the gold.
[04:55.26]Why would they want... Does nobody get this?
[04:58.36]Nobody gets this.
[04:59.68]Oh, it's been... That movie came out like 10 years ago.
[05:01.46]Nobody cares.
[05:04.27]Nobody understands this?
[05:05.39]What I'm like saying?
[05:07.49]Really?
[05:07.75]What?
[05:09.77]What?
[05:16.30]I don't want to say the movie because I feel like people are going to be like, what the fuck, dude?
[05:19.90]I've never seen that movie.
[05:22.48]People know what movie I'm talking about, right?
[05:25.94]Bro, chill.
[05:26.72]I'm fucking chill.
[05:28.06]What?
[05:28.46]Don't tell me to chill.
[05:29.39]Who are you?
[05:30.41]Who is that person?
[05:32.79]I am perfectly chilled out right now.
[05:35.67]Dude, I was fine until you said that.

[05:45.96]Or you'll probably, you've ever, it's Avatar.
[05:47.84]You've all seen Avatar.
[05:49.40]Who has not seen Avatar in this chat?
[05:51.80]There has to be nobody here.
[05:53.56]And they're coming out with like 10 more of them.
[05:55.03]So whatever.
[05:57.69]You chill.
[05:58.31]You need to chill out.
[05:58.91]I'm chilling out right now.

[06:16.08]Yeah, I am.
[06:17.30]And I'm fine with it.

[08:43.32]Are you ready?
[08:47.40]Here it comes.
[08:53.21]You look like you're from L.A.
[08:54.13]Noire.

[09:09.35]I don't care.
[09:21.58]Hey, Kay.
[09:22.84]Sorry I'm late.
[09:23.78]It's okay.
[09:24.30]I'm just enjoying the day.
[09:27.42]You said you had something important to tell me?
[09:29.32]Okay, yeah.
[09:29.90]I hope it's not about Chris wanting me to join his operation, because I already told him that's not happening.
[09:37.13]I see what he puts you and the rest of his hound wolf squad through.
[09:40.57]Oh, thank you.
[09:41.19]It's not about that.
[09:43.71]It is about you.
[09:45.85]Play the new Call of Duty, or else.
[09:49.87]Stop talking during the movie!
[09:52.71]How is, um... How are things at school?
[09:56.73]Seriously?
[09:57.77]That's what you wanted to talk to me about?
[09:59.53]That group of mean girls still hassling you?
[10:03.01]You mean, are they still treating me like a freak?
[10:05.01]Hey!
[10:05.21]Uh-uh.
[10:07.57]Look at me.
[10:08.57]You are not a freak.
[10:12.79]I am.
[10:13.19]You know I am.
[10:15.30]That's why I keep my distance from everybody at school.
[10:19.60]If they knew what I really was... So...
[10:26.38]You don't have any friends that you can talk to.
[10:29.50]Who is this?
[10:30.08]Talk to?
[10:31.20]About what?
[10:32.76]How I'm hardly even human?
[10:34.28]How I'm some kind of horrendous monster?
[10:38.50]But, hey, it's okay.
[10:40.91]I hardly ever murder my friends.
[10:42.35]What if there were a way to get rid of your powers?
[10:51.45]I'd get rid of them in a heartbeat.
[10:53.03]Get rid of them?
[10:55.54]All right, well, I think there's something I need to show you.
[11:00.75]Get rid of your powers.
[11:03.27]You already know about Miranda and the mutamycete, how she researched it obsessively and performed experiments on human subjects.
[11:10.17]Like me.
[11:11.57]Exactly.
[11:13.00]What you don't know is that we recently found some of her research.
[11:17.26]Apparently, she discovered a purifying crystal that can remove the mutamycete from its host.
[11:23.85]Purifying crystal we can get our hands on one of these we might be able to weaken or remove your powers entirely Are you kidding me?
[11:31.94]No, no, but her notes are incomplete However, I wouldn't want to get rid of all of them.
[11:36.98]I think I have an idea where we can find the rest of her research Let's do it.
[11:41.79]Let's find it.
[11:42.45]Where is it?
[11:45.67]In there What
[11:49.28]You just have to, uh, you just have to drink that.
[11:50.53]Be careful, it smells like puke.
[11:51.65]Oh.
[12:21.13]That sounds crazy.
[12:23.09]You sound crazy.
[12:24.13]Yes.
[12:24.67]Yes.
[12:25.65]Yes, Rose, but not dangerous.
[12:28.69]Right?
[12:28.91]Think of it just like walking through somebody else's memories.
[12:33.86]You really think this can work?
[12:35.24]I think it's worth trying.
[12:37.72]What do you have to lose?
[12:38.50]This is going to be like... How do I even do this?
[12:44.20]Red Kool-Aid, like molasses.
[12:46.86]I don't know.
[12:48.20]Try reaching out to it.
[12:50.48]It's Halloween, Rose.
[12:51.64]Uh-oh.
[12:54.28]It's reacting.
[13:01.52]Oh.
[13:19.37]Oh my god, Rose is so weird.
[13:21.91]Yeah, it's like she sees things that aren't there.
[13:25.29]Creepy.
[13:26.09]Stay away from us, you freak.
[13:27.67]Imagine wanting to be friends with her.
[13:29.59]She's definitely not normal.
[13:30.62]Ew, something just moved on her hand.
[13:32.50]What's wrong with her?
[13:33.54]Why would you not want to be friends with a person that has fucking superpowers?
[13:36.04]Are you out of your mind?
[13:36.82]Freak.
[13:37.58]Ew, something just moved on her hand.
[13:40.30]Go away.
[13:41.64]Freak.
[13:42.72]Oh, freak.
[13:43.90]Just disgusting.
[13:44.68]Please just stop!
[13:51.37]Oh, she's weird.
[13:54.07]Okay.
[13:55.51]She has, like, Avengers-level superpowers.
[14:00.15]Don't... I'm still here?
[14:03.72]Kay.
[14:06.18]Kay?
[14:08.80]Where are you?
[14:09.72]Kay!
[14:10.46]If Captain America walked in the room, would they go, He's weird.
[14:13.44]This isn't right.
[14:22.08]What's her superpower?
[14:25.56]Uh... Super strength?
[14:28.40]Is she gonna have bugs come out of her hands or something?
[14:32.30]I don't know.
[14:32.68]With something.
[14:34.14]What is it?
[14:38.49]It's mold.
[14:39.13]She has, like, powerful mold bugs.
[14:41.07]She has powerful mold that can... She can do, like, a venom arm.
[14:45.39]Like... That can come out.
[14:49.01]Okay, well, anyways, hi, I'm back.
[14:51.47]So let's play.
[14:53.47]Miranda's research claims that the megamycete preserves the memories of people who passed away within its area of influence, absorbing them into its own vast consciousness.
[15:03.30]We also know, based on our previous encounters with the mold, that people who are contaminated with the metamycete, what is that word?
[15:11.28]Spell it authentically for me.
[15:13.46]Metamycete?
[15:15.73]I was gonna say metamucil.
[15:17.67]Meta-me-meh, how is it?
[15:19.07]Whatever.
[15:19.91]Alright, so you get on this mold network.
[15:24.49]So there's a mold network.
[15:25.61]If we extrapolate from this, we can summarize that subjects with a strong affinity to the metamycete should be able to use the network to connect to the memories of the dead within the megamycete.
[15:37.82]It should be possible to verify this theory using the lab's megamycete sample we collected 16 years ago.
[15:43.29]We just need a suitable subject with a proven connection to the mold.
[15:46.67]It's a network.
[15:48.57]Unfortunately, this presents a problem.
[15:49.93]Our organization's policies prevent us from directly contacting civilians who are infected with butamycete.
[15:56.96]Certainly, the ethical reasoning is understandable, but it has rendered the confirmation of this theory impossible.
[16:02.52]It pains me to think of how much mankind could stand to benefit from this preservation and indexing of human consciousness.
[16:08.60]The possibilities of preserving or even reclaiming great minds.
[16:11.70]Perhaps there's some way of cutting through the red tape.
[16:17.74]Okay.
[16:20.06]Why is this in fir- Is this a third person game?
[16:23.29]Why is it in third person?
[16:28.43]Did I pick third person?
[16:34.08]They just added it.
[16:34.66]Yeah, but is the DLC third person?
[16:42.66]Yes.
[16:46.62]Wait, what?
[16:48.26]Explore.
[16:55.78]Wait, what's in here?
[16:56.26]Nothing?
[17:04.01]Yeah, I don't think I can do it.
[17:04.81]It's too scary.
[17:07.53]Okay.
[17:15.17]This is so... Imagine you get, like, locked in this place.
[17:18.09]Like, you got teleported to this place.
[17:23.71]I really think the John Jingleheimer Schmidt routine would actually benefit you.
[17:27.43]It really would.
[17:27.89]Because, I mean, look.
[17:31.41]At some point...
[17:33.81]Like, you're... You're... You're fucked here.
[17:36.63]You know what I mean?
[17:37.11]Like, you're... What are you gonna do?
[17:40.23]No.
[17:40.71]I would just barrel down this hallway screaming John Jingleheimer Schmidt and just throwing stuff around and, like, dancing and making, like, weird sound effects.
[17:47.55]I think they'd be like, what the fuck is going on?
[17:48.89]Send this guy back out.
[17:49.99]We want somebody that's, like, scared.
[17:52.01]We want somebody that's, like... Like, no.
[17:53.61]We don't want this guy.
[17:54.51]This guy's fucked up.
[17:55.11]Okay.
[18:00.87]Okay.
[18:03.85]What are you out?
[18:05.17]Okay, so.
[18:08.63]It was from the last stream.
[18:09.90]It's a reference.
[18:14.30]You need to out-psycho the psycho.
[18:19.50]Just do the routine where like, you're not locked in here with me.
[18:23.22]I'm locked in here with you.
[18:25.22]The other way around.
[18:26.89]It's me you need to be afraid.
[18:28.19]Yeah, just start screaming that, right?
[18:30.97]What is this?
[18:36.54]Oh, it's a shoe.
[18:37.90]Have I rotated?
[18:39.34]Oh.
[18:48.53]Or just pull the routine on them.
[18:51.75]Just find a really echoey part of this castle.
[18:56.23]And just do their routine, you know?
[18:58.67]Just sit there and just kind of go like...
[19:05.37]They'll be like this.
[19:05.91]I'm supposed to be doing that.
[19:06.81]Why are they doing that?
[19:11.53]It would just mess him all up.
[19:12.37]It would just walk him up.
[19:16.97]Let me out.
[19:18.11]OK, that's actually kind of scary.
[19:20.85]Oh, this is a memory.
[19:21.79]Anything I can do?
[19:29.35]Is someone there?
[19:30.31]Dangerous here.
[19:33.57]What is why?
[19:39.48]What?
[19:40.18]No.
[19:42.74]We don't know who's in there.
[19:50.46]That's such a Dark Souls room, by the way.
[19:54.37]Talk through the door to like the weirdo.
[19:56.89]And am I just going to open the door?
[20:11.19]Okay.
[20:14.21]Need to find a key.
[20:15.11]Do I have a map?
[20:15.65]Probably not.
[20:16.83]Not yet.
[20:20.71]Mirrors?
[20:22.75]What is that?
[20:23.23]Okay, we're good.
[20:30.08]What is on it?
[20:35.34]Stop it from moving.
[20:36.20]Because it's weird and creepy.
[20:38.54]Yeah, it's creepy.
[20:43.64]Is there a key?
[20:44.14]I feel like someone's going to be in this room now.
[20:46.19]Oh, that's... Okay.
[20:53.29]That's my name.
[21:00.62]I thought that was a cake for a second.
[21:06.30]Fucking YouTuber.
[21:08.52]It's still in me.
[21:09.34]It's still there, by the way.
[21:12.74]I used to be a YouTuber, okay?
[21:15.32]Years and years ago.
[21:21.48]What's this say?
[21:22.74]To create art, simply add to the rabbit's carcasses.
[21:26.97]Decay is not an issue.
[21:28.93]Spruce them up a bit with makeup.
[21:31.05]It makes them seem more alive.
[21:32.31]Ah, alright.
[21:36.61]Find the crystal.
[21:37.37]Find the key to the cell.
[21:38.37]Explore your surroundings.
[21:41.30]So, I'm currently searching this area.
[21:43.46]I gotta view files in the journal, alright.
[21:48.88]Did the guy draw a picture of himself?
[21:52.46]Oh, no, I did.
[21:53.10]Pretty good artist.
[21:56.73]Okay.
[21:58.67]Alright, alright, alright.
[22:01.11]Why did I think he did that?
[22:03.31]He handed me these notes.
[22:05.37]Just in case you forget who it is, it's me.
[22:09.90]Honestly, this almost looks like... This almost looks like she held the paper up to his face and shaded with a pencil.
[22:16.92]Like, that's how this picture came to be.
[22:19.36]Does that make any sense?
[22:26.77]Those things are cool, by the way.
[22:27.89]It's like a little... Alright, whatever.
[22:29.09]Alright, so where do I need to go?
[22:31.13]I need to go... I already went that way.
[22:33.09]I did not go up to the top left.
[22:36.02]So let's just check to make sure there's nothing else here.
[22:40.13]Uh-huh, this way.
[22:40.83]I don't have any weapons.
[22:54.57]Is there a gun?
[22:57.09]Oh, God.
[22:57.69]Okay, there's the key.
[22:58.55]I'll step in that.
[23:25.75]Can I not step in it?
[23:29.63]Okay, I got a cell key.
[23:30.60]I don't have any items.
[23:34.00]Alright.
[23:35.72]Can I step in that?
[23:36.40]Or is it going to hurt me?
[23:38.30]I guess I can go this way.
[23:42.44]Do I die if I step in that?
[23:45.37]I think I die if I touch that.
[23:46.35]Okay.
[23:51.08]Okay, just don't.
[23:59.34]It's in here, right?
[24:00.29]No, where is it?
[24:01.47]This way.
[24:03.89]Something's going to break through this door.
[24:10.53]Left.
[24:10.91]Okay, yep.
[24:12.09]Is there... How do I sprint?
[24:13.58]Gross.
[24:22.36]Alright, it's right here.
[24:27.47]I think I need to make the game a little brighter.
[24:36.45]Who's in here?
[24:40.88]What's this?
[24:53.95]Watch out.
[24:55.63]Whatever it is, it's alive!
[25:00.64]It's you.
[25:13.87]It's me.
[25:29.51]Literally me.
[25:39.52]That doesn't help.
[25:40.10]That doesn't help.
[25:47.93]Well, I mean, if we're together, we may as well harmonize John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[25:52.21]It would sound better.
[25:54.73]John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[25:57.48]It would be fucking sick.
[26:01.11]Yeah, well.
[26:04.19]I could do the high part as long as you can do the low part.
[26:15.41]What are you doing?
[26:15.87]Oh, there's a way to sneak.
[26:19.29]OK.
[26:25.28]She's you.
[26:26.00]She can't do the low part.
[26:27.44]Oh, that's right.
[26:28.50]I didn't think about that.
[26:33.72]Hey wait, where are you going?
[26:42.26]Get in there.
[26:47.32]Someone's gonna jump out.
[26:48.26]Oh OK.
[27:04.59]What's going on?
[27:05.09]What's wrong?
[27:05.39]Is there another?
[27:06.97]There's another one?
[27:09.45]Quick, quick, quick before she dies!
[27:11.93]John, Jacob, King Gohan.
[27:14.75]That's alright, never mind.
[27:18.54]I could do the low part.
[27:20.16]Why are there so many roses?
[27:21.58]They all look just like me.
[27:25.12]Don't press any buttons.
[27:26.02]Do you know what's happening here?
[27:30.52]Hey, are you listening to me?
[27:33.61]What are we looking for?
[27:35.63]Find the switch handle.
[27:41.11]Can't get out.
[27:43.61]Alright, I need the handle.
[27:45.13]We need to find the handle.
[27:45.73]Do you have the handle?
[27:50.17]On the ground over here?
[27:50.89]Can I?
[27:51.57]Is it just there?
[27:52.49]Can I touch it?
[27:54.51]No, I need a handle.
[27:57.39]This way.
[27:57.73]The switch handle is missing.
[28:03.73]Okay, find that handle.
[28:04.93]Go deeper.
[28:06.35]What does this mean?
[28:07.03]Ooh, I can go up here.
[28:10.77]Am I locked in here?
[28:11.39]No.
[28:15.18]Uh, I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go this way first.
[28:18.12]This looks interesting.
[28:26.13]Okay, that wasn't anything.
[28:27.95]That was an exit.
[28:28.69]Something's going to chase us around here.
[28:31.83]Without a doubt.
[28:33.35]That's definitely a way to escape when a monster comes out here and attacks.
[28:42.75]Alright, let's sneak down there.
[28:43.65]Do I have a light, right?
[28:52.72]Yeah.
[28:55.80]Okay, this that way?
[28:56.82]Wait, what's the map look like?
[28:57.84]Alright.
[29:02.73]What happened?
[29:06.83]What was that?
[29:13.18]What the fuck is that sound?
[29:22.50]Oh, this is behind where... Oh.
[29:24.92]Are these all me?
[29:32.21]This one looks rendered.
[29:33.33]It's gonna... This one's rendered.
[29:35.09]You know what I'm saying?
[29:35.83]What I mean?
[29:36.13]What I said?
[29:36.77]This is like a 3D rendered model.
[29:40.29]I'm telling you, it's gonna stand up.
[29:48.75]Nothing here?
[29:55.07]I'm telling you, these are rendered 3D models.
[29:57.56]Does anybody have a key?
[30:06.31]Nobody has a key.
[30:08.11]You don't have the key on you somewhere.
[30:10.83]Okay, well, it's not here.
[30:29.74]Honestly, I've gotten jumpier in the last five years.
[30:31.86]I really have.
[30:34.99]I told you.
[30:35.35]They were fucking rendered.
[30:36.47]They were rendered 3D models.
[30:38.05]I told you.
[30:38.47]They're literally rendered models.
[30:42.09]They're rendered 3D models.
[30:52.25]Okay, unlock this.
[30:53.03]Alright, where... okay.
[30:56.15]Straight, right, left.
[31:01.58]I want a run button so bad, you have no idea.
[31:04.30]Uh-oh.
[31:25.22]What the fuck?
[31:49.79]Oh, what are her powers then?
[31:51.11]Fucking electric hands?
[31:53.69]Are you kidding me?
[31:58.95]She has, like, force hands.
[32:05.14]Blade!
[32:06.54]Escape the monsters.
[32:09.66]All right, press it.
[32:10.20]Press the button quick.
[32:18.40]Oh, shit.
[32:19.08]I'm sorry.
[32:20.82]Oh, my God.
[32:21.40]They're coming from every angle.
[32:23.00]How do I get out of here?
[32:23.72]Come on.
[32:29.74]Open up, hurry.
[32:31.55]Oh, God damn it.
[32:33.43]Oh, jeez.
[32:34.77]Okay, we're good.
[32:36.99]No way.
[32:37.49]Oh, my God.
[32:50.67]Jeez.
[32:51.19]It's an end.
[33:04.19]Alright, here it comes.
[33:11.04]Is it an invisible wall?
[33:14.62]Wait, can I go that way?
[33:15.26]I don't care.
[33:21.38]Excuse me?
[33:22.12]I have to go back?
[33:23.89]Um, how?
[33:26.85]Huh?
[33:28.01]There's no way to go.
[33:29.49]I can't get out of here.
[33:30.35]I'm trapped.
[33:34.99]Get the fuck out of the way.
[33:36.65]How do I slide?
[33:37.69]Is there a slide button?
[33:39.35]This is probably a slide button, right?
[33:44.35]How do I get out of here?
[33:48.81]Get out of the way.
[33:49.55]You're blocking the entrance.
[33:50.69]It's not fair.
[33:51.29]Get out of the way.
[33:52.99]You've blocked the entrance.
[33:54.00]It's not fair.
[33:54.80]I got by.
[34:00.68]I'm so fucked up.
[34:06.02]Am I gonna make it?
[34:09.53]This way, this way.
[34:10.55]Okay.
[34:18.09]Alright, I made it.
[34:20.11]Oh my god.
[34:23.53]They were blocking the entrance.
[34:24.51]That wasn't fair.
[34:25.15]Alright, there's only one way to go.
[34:30.51]Did I heal?
[34:34.75]Crouch and press Q to do a spin move.
[34:37.83]You made that up.
[34:39.47]There's no spin move.
[34:44.33]There is no spin move.
[34:47.87]I'm talking about like Zangief.
[34:50.61]Like, go, go, go, go, go.
[34:51.57]You spin with the fists out?
[34:52.72]No.
[35:07.37]You OK?
[35:07.75]I'm the narrator.
[35:11.52]Not enemy.
[35:12.34]Friend.
[35:12.50]Leave now.
[35:12.76]Hell.
[35:14.48]Come on, write it.
[35:16.16]Go while you can.
[35:39.09]Not until I get this out of my body.
[35:41.65]There's a crystal here that will remove the mold.
[35:44.59]I need to find it.
[35:48.19]And I'm not leaving until I do.
[35:49.95]You're dangerous.
[35:56.08]Who are you?
[35:57.60]My guardian angel?
[36:02.24]Sure.
[36:02.56]That's funny.
[36:04.90]Do you have a name?
[36:07.67]If you're an angel, then... Gabriel?
[36:11.77]Michael?
[36:16.48]Michael.
[36:16.84]Okay.
[36:20.70]Michael.
[36:23.68]What now?
[36:28.36]Dangerous here.
[36:29.68]Move.
[36:32.92]Who's Michael?
[36:33.58]Okay.
[36:43.02]Where even am I?
[36:43.56]Okay.
[36:47.82]Oh, wait.
[36:48.28]There is a typewriter.
[36:49.28]Yep.
[36:52.10]Very cool.
[36:53.04]Game is saved.
[36:59.64]First aid.
[37:00.26]Yep.
[37:00.46]Alright.
[37:01.69]Open inventory.
[37:02.15]I remember this.
[37:02.61]You can... Medicine that heals all wounds.
[37:07.83]Isn't there a quick way to do it?
[37:11.90]There's a quick heal somehow, right?
[37:14.24]You can make healing items too, from my understanding.
[37:18.46]I played the game.
[37:19.53]Of course I understand it.
[37:22.57]Why are you so wide today?
[37:23.67]I'm not.
[37:25.25]Somebody called my hairline a parallelogram.
[37:27.39]What does that mean?
[37:32.73]These poor things.
[37:38.67]These poor things.
[37:58.63]So it's the Duke, right?
[38:00.19]Yeah, I saw the trailer.
[38:02.55]So what, is the Duke a bad guy?
[38:04.45]I thought he was a good guy.
[38:08.05]I thought he helped us.
[38:09.59]Looks like we caught another.
[38:26.79]Lively now, aren't you?
[38:29.19]You should have put that effort into running.
[38:31.81]It would have made the chase that much more thrilling.
[38:37.40]Let me go!
[38:37.98]Let me go!
[38:40.18]It would seem this little rabbit lacks the necessary fortitude.
[38:46.34]What the hell?
[38:52.57]A pity.
[38:53.83]You had shown a little grit and actually escaped.
[38:56.00]That purifying crystal would now be yours.
[38:59.46]The crystal?
[39:01.52]Who's this?
[39:06.84]Oh, now we have a new little rabbit to pursue.
[39:11.69]Let's see how fast this one is.
[39:15.11]I love this actor.
[39:17.39]Find her!
[39:18.97]Hunt her down!
[39:21.12]He's great.
[39:24.13]Okay, I'm back and I'm ready to run.
[39:27.85]There's a lot.
[39:28.99]Wait a minute.
[39:29.51]Okay.
[39:30.69]Where do I go?
[39:37.23]I can't open that.
[39:37.95]Dude.
[39:44.04]Oh my God.
[39:45.52]Okay.
[39:50.82]What?
[39:51.72]Oh, come on.
[39:58.48]What the hell?
[40:00.02]A way out?
[40:10.77]Um... Um... Back this way.
[40:13.19]I need a... Oh.
[40:16.57]Alright.
[40:16.85]We're good.
[40:21.53]Need... Weapon.
[40:26.53]Gun.
[40:30.33]seriously where am I gonna get a gun touch my words what like this okay well if you can manifest me a rocket launcher in the first 10 minutes of the game here we go
[40:57.64]Point and shoot.
[40:58.84]Who is this tutorial text?
[41:09.62]Okay.
[41:15.06]Oh, here's bullets.
[41:20.42]Third person is back.
[41:26.31]So what's going on here?
[41:28.05]Can I shoot?
[41:28.41]Should I shoot this?
[41:31.01]Do the spin move.
[41:32.12]Okay.
[41:38.34]It's just... Alright, I get it.
[41:39.80]Actually, that's a good... That's actually good for me to know.
[41:44.82]Acquire the crystal.
[41:53.05]Alright, I can't go down here.
[41:55.33]No, I can't, right?
[41:56.17]Okay.
[41:58.73]So, that means... Where have I not gone?
[42:02.03]Straight through here?
[42:04.22]There's a door over this way.
[42:05.24]There's the crystal right there!
[42:09.06]There it is!
[42:10.74]Just take it!
[42:13.18]A large crystal is glowing with a pale blue light.
[42:19.19]The disciples await their masks, bronze, silver, gold, with their... I guess I need to find these masks to unlock it.
[42:25.57]Okay.
[42:26.49]With their garb arrayed, the light shall be released.
[42:29.40]We need three masks to release the crystal.
[42:31.92]Okay, you got it.
[42:35.42]Shoot it.
[42:36.34]Shoot the glass.
[42:39.78]Not that easy.
[42:42.34]It's not that simple.
[42:50.17]Check out GrottoBeast.com.
[42:52.33]GrottoBeast.com.
[42:54.99]Not enough people here I can talk about it.
[42:56.91]So, GrottoBeast.com is available right now.
[43:02.48]The website's not there.
[43:04.46]This is literally just a placeholder.
[43:06.64]But what is there is for you to drop an email.
[43:10.38]This is going to the merch company.
[43:14.74].net also works, too.
[43:17.08].comredirects.net is there, yeah.
[43:19.10]You can put your email in, which will go to our fulfillment company, to decide if you are interested in this product.
[43:29.37]throttlebeast.com.
[43:30.37]That must mean it must be coming soon.
[43:35.29]The website is a placeholder.
[43:37.23]We're only trying to see how many people are interested.
[43:40.50]because what's grotto beasts oh we got a lot to tell you so uh grottobeast.com is a trading card game it's been in development for about a year and a half fake fan that's not a fake fan because I mean you could have started watching like six months ago a month ago new viewer andy
[44:05.85]But we're trying to see how the fulfillment company wants to kind of know how many people are interested.
[44:13.11]Because we need to figure out how many we need to make, you know, preliminarily.
[44:18.28]So if you're interested, drop it there.
[44:21.34]It's not, no, it's a physical card.
[44:23.56]It's not digital.
[44:27.36]We're trying to garner some interest and see how it is.
[44:30.42]It's really fucking cool.
[44:34.04]There are 200 cards.
[44:37.58]It's a bunch of characters from this universe as well as Grotto Beasts.
[44:43.50]It's 200 fucking cards.
[44:47.04]It is an enormous project.
[44:51.70]It is a game.
[44:54.50]There are 15 artists that have participated.
[44:58.41]I'm one of them.
[44:59.55]That's right.
[45:00.11]I'm one of them.
[45:02.29]Physical NFTs.
[45:08.28]So what I really want to do is I want to make sure that whoever wants them can get them.
[45:14.38]So we really have no idea how many we need to make first.
[45:19.75]I don't want to have it be a case where there's some odd hundred or some odd thousand amount of people that want them, but we don't make enough in this first pass.
[45:31.51]This is a huge project that has been...
[45:34.95]It's essentially like a gigantic community love letter, essentially.
[45:39.27]It's tons of references to streams.
[45:42.43]There's tons of original characters that have been created by all the artists.
[45:46.70]It's really, really cool.
[45:47.98]Will it ship to the EU?
[45:49.12]Of course, absolutely.
[45:51.92]This is not NA only.
[45:56.36]How much to ship international?
[45:58.34]These are questions that I do not have the answer to right now.
[46:03.39]All this is, that placeholder website is just there to just get an idea for the fulfillment company, how many people might actually be interested.
[46:12.12]And we're going to go from there.
[46:16.63]Yeah, Holly had a huge amount to do with this.
[46:19.57]As well as all the other artists.
[46:21.65]And obviously, all the other people that worked on it.
[46:24.16]It's been a big undertaking.
[46:26.00]And it looks, it's fucking awesome, I'm telling you.
[46:28.20]There's a whole game.
[46:29.94]We have contracted out a game designer to make this whole thing.
[46:33.30]It's actually really fucking fun.
[46:35.56]It's actually fun.
[46:36.30]It's very fun.
[46:40.98]Tweet the website, you monster.
[46:43.89]Yeah, so how it's gonna work, uh, because it's a game, we want to make sure that, because there'll be packs you can buy, right?
[46:51.17]Just booster packs.
[46:52.47]But, did you, wait, did you actually call me a monster or not?
[46:55.86]So, besides these booster packs, we're going to sell a kit, like a starter kit, to make sure monster packs, what did I say?
[47:06.22]Did I just say monster packs?
[47:11.26]No, I said booster packs, right?
[47:12.51]Okay.
[47:15.58]Yeah, there's going to be holographics.
[47:17.32]There's going to be all the shit that you are used to, right?
[47:21.14]But there's going to be a starter kit that's going to be two full decks, so you don't have to worry about it.
[47:26.73]You can just buy it if you want it and have it.
[47:29.73]But we also thought it would be fun to have these booster packs where you can open them and get like, oh my god, I got a holographic Bugleberry!
[47:39.35]He's a card, by the way.
[47:42.81]And price point wise, I don't want to... This is going to be something that I want to make sure is affordable, right?
[47:50.61]I don't want to do a thing where, oh yeah, the card packs are fucking unbelievably egregious.
[47:57.23]No, no, it's not going to happen.
[47:59.87]I don't know what the price is going to be, but we're going to try to keep it reasonable.
[48:05.27]This is essentially just really interesting, a really interesting merch project that came about a year and a half ago after that stream.
[48:13.90]And we're finally almost ready to start showing it off.
[48:17.21]So.
[48:20.72]So, if it's a success, awesome.
[48:24.62]If it's not a success, it was fun to do.
[48:27.96]I just really hope you guys think they're cool.
[48:30.30]That's all I care about.
[48:31.01]It's just, are these cool?
[48:33.39]Is it fun merch?
[48:34.33]Is the game fun?
[48:35.19]And the answer to those questions, I think, are all yes.
[48:39.82]So, grottobeast.com, grottobeast.net.
[48:43.99]If you have any interest, please just fill out your email so you can be notified when it happens and we can figure out how much we need to make.
[48:53.96]Is auto a card?
[48:54.74]Yes.
[48:55.36]There are 200 cards.
[48:58.03]And the starter deck, I don't know, Holly, if you're here, do we know how many cards are in the starter deck?
[49:03.83]Like the starter kit that you can get that has two full decks and all of the materials you need.
[49:08.59]Do we know how many cards are in the starter?
[49:20.61]Do we have any idea?
[49:24.39]So, well, let me get this accurate, but it's going to be, if you don't want to buy boosters, and you just want, like, I believe the two decks have 41 cards each.
[49:36.13]Okay.
[49:37.59]So you're going to be able to enjoy it if you don't want to just buy boosters, which I also want to try to do this meaningfully and have it be like orders, right?
[49:47.08]Rather than have it sell out as like...
[49:51.17]That's it.
[49:52.03]We sold 1,500 copies.
[49:54.57]Goodbye.
[49:55.19]It's over.
[49:55.71]It's limited.
[49:56.37]No.
[49:57.33]I don't want it to be limited in the sense that it's deliberately limited so deliberately not as many people that want it can get it.
[50:06.20]There you go.
[50:09.42]Just go ask her.
[50:10.09]She's in your house.
[50:11.83]I'm like speaking into the air.
[50:16.73]Holly, how many cards are in each deck?
[50:19.11]Do we know?
[50:22.49]Yeah.
[50:24.09]We're just trying to get some interest, and that's it.
[50:25.95]I hope you enjoy it when it actually does come out.
[50:28.07]It's been a pretty long project.
[50:32.33]Which I will tell you, after spending the last year plus overseeing the development and being a part of a card game, it's a lot.
[50:44.36]The artists have spent a ton of time working on it.
[50:46.52]The game designer has put tons of tons of love into it.
[50:50.62]I'm just excited for you to get it in your hands.
[50:53.10]So,
[50:55.43]That was the announcement for today.
[50:59.73]What if nobody's interested?
[51:02.85]Well, and... Oh, well.
[51:06.07]It was fun to do it.
[51:12.33]Yeah, we've been waiting for the time to be able to tell people.
[51:14.83]Because if you saw, the Grotto Beast banner on the baseball stream was kind of there.
[51:18.23]And it's like, hey, look.
[51:21.15]This thing's still a thing.
[51:27.71]Okay.
[51:30.65]It's okay, man.
[51:31.39]I'll buy it.
[51:33.71]If you are interested and you think it's cool, then... Yeah.
[51:42.34]I hope when you get it, I hope it's high quality.
[51:45.02]I hope you enjoy it.
[51:45.86]We're trying to make it as good quality and price point, right?
[51:49.30]Look, I'm trying.
[51:51.24]I'm gonna catch them all.
[51:53.44]Why did I just say that out loud?
[51:55.78]You're going to collect all the cards.
[52:01.32]Whatever.
[52:01.60]All right, so let's keep going.
[52:03.00]So I have to go to find the three masks, which is, I have not been through here yet.
[52:07.57]I have eight shots.
[52:14.59]Ooh, shotgun.
[52:19.63]All right, I need a key.
[52:21.07]Grant me that which sees the truth through its three eyes.
[52:25.85]I need a big key.
[52:39.43]I'm never going to open this.
[52:47.67]Cut the chain.
[52:48.81]OK, this is where the chain is.
[52:52.41]I need like a pair of pliers, right?
[52:57.25]Should I shoot enemies or should I just say bullets until the end of the game and then shoot the boss with 150 handgun rounds?
[53:10.63]Did I turn the flashlight off?
[53:12.08]Do I have a flashlight?
[53:14.58]Okay.
[53:22.30]All right.
[53:23.94]How many shots does it take?
[53:28.46]You take way too many shots.
[53:39.99]Oh.
[53:40.93]Also.
[53:43.85]There are two streams that I'm trying to do before the year ends.
[53:46.93]Two big ones.
[53:48.61]Two of them.
[53:51.95]I needed to pause for that, by the way.
[53:57.94]Ooh, cutters.
[54:00.93]I do have some very sad news.
[54:03.71]That is a bad reverse announcement.
[54:07.77]I did tease... I did tease that Mr. Greens had something in the pipeline.
[54:15.99]And I got a phone call from Mr. Grains and he backed out.
[54:20.31]Mr. Grains has backed out.
[54:21.40]He told me to go fuck myself.
[54:22.62]That was literally his exact words.
[54:25.64]He thought it was a dumb project.
[54:28.36]He said no.
[54:29.20]So I was like, okay.
[54:32.20]That stream is no longer currently in development.
[54:37.46]I have to say.
[54:38.94]There are two others that currently are.
[54:42.06]So don't worry.
[54:43.96]Over here.
[54:50.16]What was it?
[54:51.52]I don't want to say because if for some reason I actually do go through with it... Then... Are you spawning in ammo?
[54:57.02]Thanks for the ammo.
[54:57.74]You spawned one small ammo box.
[55:15.32]Just spawn a huge, like, detonator or something.
[55:18.18]You know what I mean?
[55:18.70]Like, spawn a bunch of C4 throughout this whole place.
[55:22.76]And then let me... What are you talking... Why are you doing this?
[55:30.27]Okay, I need... I got the bolt cutters, which was over here, right?
[55:37.35]You can't dodge a battle axe.
[55:38.57]Yes, I fucking can.
[55:39.77]I'm so sick of seeing people write that.
[55:41.77]I'll prove it.
[55:42.19]Don't worry.
[55:50.85]Oh, this is the same place.
[55:53.06]So what is this?
[55:53.66]What is this thing?
[55:55.20]There's a gross lumpy thing growing here.
[55:58.90]Wasted a bullet.
[55:59.60]Great.
[56:06.28]There's gotta be some serum I pour on that, right?
[56:08.52]Okay, I'm looking for the shotgun key.
[56:16.51]Herb.
[56:16.95]Good.
[56:18.96]Uh-huh.
[56:19.98]You can combine... Alright, herb and chem fluid is a healing potion.
[56:23.48]Right.
[56:23.90]And then chem fluid and gunpowder is bullets.
[56:25.89]Right.
[56:26.33]Gotta refresh my memory.
[56:29.81]It's one of these big things you want to do dodging a battleaxe.
[56:37.31]How?
[56:41.68]It's trapped.
[56:45.46]Core.
[56:45.78]Core.
[56:48.03]Use your powers.
[56:48.49]Only way.
[56:49.09]I need an amplifier.
[56:50.97]Sorry, I'm biting my lip.
[57:23.08]I need to get an amplifier that way.
[57:31.62]Why is it a battle axe?
[57:32.50]Why not just a regular axe?
[57:33.40]Because that's not what I said.
[57:35.46]I said a battle axe.
[57:37.60]I'm very confident in my ability to do just what I described.
[57:41.03]Okay, so I have to find an amplifier to use my powers on these plant things to get rid of them.
[57:54.73]Okay, so those are obviously just scattered around the world here.
[58:08.68]All right.
[58:13.44]This is, by the way, this is a fully 3D rendered model.
[58:16.43]It's standing up.
[58:30.47]Gunpowder.
[58:30.93]Nice.
[58:38.94]If you always want to tell if an enemy is going to stand up or not, just look for like the aliasing.
[58:43.90]Right?
[58:45.24]If something in the environment has aliasing, it's standing up.
[59:02.13]Yep, look at the hair.
[59:03.15]I see the aliasing.
[59:15.25]Chem fluid.
[59:18.47]I can use these things and combine them.
[59:20.72]There might be more items I can combine.
[59:21.98]Okay.
[59:23.10]I'm going to save it.
[59:25.04]I don't really need it for now.
[59:26.06]Alright, the tutorial wants me to do it, so I'll just do it.
[59:32.74]Okay.
[59:34.38]Cool.
[59:35.32]So where are we going here?
[59:36.04]Alright, I can go this way or that way.
[59:37.66]This way or that way.
[59:43.89]Yeah.
[59:45.07]Come on, Gwyn.
[59:45.59]That thing's standing up.
[60:05.40]Shut up.
[60:09.22]Oh.
[60:16.57]How are you not dead?
[60:28.72]I shot your... Okay.
[60:33.82]Alright, we're good.
[60:37.12]Is that oof gunpowder?
[60:53.14]Somebody's gonna jump out from behind a curtain.
[60:55.04]I... I don't have any bullets.
[60:59.45]Okay, I need bullets like right now.
[61:02.85]Oh, uh oh.
[61:03.83]Do I have a knife or anything?
[61:04.67]I don't have a knife.
[61:10.81]Oh, come on.
[61:11.59]Alright, I just gotta run.
[61:12.59]Did I get what I needed from here?
[61:13.57]Oh, chem fluid.
[61:20.32]Eight bullets.
[61:25.94]Is this the thing I'm looking for?
[61:28.41]Is this a stove?
[61:29.57]What is this?
[61:39.81]It's a pizza oven.
[61:41.81]It looks like a lady from Beauty and the Beast.
[61:45.72]What's that?
[61:45.98]What's the lady at the big, um, the big bureau?
[61:53.10]The cabinet?
[61:54.16]What is the cabinet from Beauty and the Beast?
[61:57.78]The teapot.
[62:00.62]There's no cabinet in Beauty and the Beast?
[62:03.70]Is there a huge cabinet in Beauty and the Beast?
[62:09.91]There is.
[62:10.37]Yeah.
[62:10.73]No, there is.
[62:12.07]The wardrobe.
[62:12.79]The bureau.
[62:13.57]Okay.
[62:13.96]Sorry.
[62:14.40]Whatever.
[62:14.82]Yeah.
[62:17.02]This is the Mandela effect.
[62:22.80]You're thinking of the straight to VHS sequel.
[62:29.58]No way I'm waiting through that.
[62:31.67]Maybe I can find a way across.
[62:36.93]Can I like step on this stuff?
[62:40.44]There's a ladder here.
[62:41.20]Okay, let's go through.
[62:47.44]The wardrobe.
[62:48.07]Okay, yeah, it is.
[62:48.87]It is.
[62:52.07]Wait, this character was actually not in the regular movie?
[63:01.52]I think I'm combining the teapot and the wardrobe into one character.
[63:11.60]Thank God.
[63:25.93]OK.
[63:33.27]Wardrobe is in the movie, but I don't think wardrobe talks.
[63:39.38]Really?
[63:49.74]she does am I missing like important stuff because I'm just looking at off screen and climbing a ladder I think we're good okay stop turning the flashlight off yeah keep it on no stop don't
[64:15.43]Keep that flashlight on.
[64:16.65]Why would you turn it off in a dark, scary house?
[64:19.59]Okay.
[64:22.53]Uh-oh.
[64:38.81]Something happened here.
[64:39.83]Uh-oh.
[64:46.98]He's oozing, am I?
[64:48.04]I shouldn't be.
[65:00.62]This.
[65:03.33]The juice box, okay.
[65:09.05]I have found a means of dramatically destabilizing parts of the mutamycete network by introducing a disruptive force to block the auto-inducers they use for communication.
[65:19.75]For example, the hard-packed cores of mold known as sclerotia begin to break down on a cellular level and disintegrate when this disrupted.
[65:32.39]Slorotia form when the mutamycete develops in new locations serving as sort of an anchor point or a foothold.
[65:39.32]They're often associated with a patch of liquid void through which the mold has spread.
[65:43.88]When the autoinducers of the Slorotia are disrupted, it begins to break down.
[65:48.80]Any liquid void connected to the Slorotia will also disintegrate.
[65:54.86]The mods are putting pictures of the wardrobe.
[65:58.38]And they're contemplating if the clothes inside are the organs and guts and shit.
[66:04.48]I just looked.
[66:04.92]I'm sorry.
[66:05.74]It fucked me up.
[66:08.44]It would appear that destabilizing the sclerodia sends a signal indicating that the location is no longer viable for mutamycete.
[66:15.89]Habitation.
[66:17.23]Triggering a full-scale retreat.
[66:25.68]Herb.
[66:27.36]Why can't I just take these?
[66:34.68]Okay, so there's the power increaser.
[66:41.22]Yes.
[66:41.94]Alright.
[66:42.64]RW Variant Flask 1.
[66:44.00]Actually, it looks good.
[66:47.35]That's definitely an alcohol.
[66:51.65]You've seen that on the counter.
[66:53.77]It's called, like, ice vodka.
[66:56.59]That's what it looks like.
[66:57.41]They make bottles like that.
[67:03.85]That shit's probably like $70 too.
[67:04.85]Use Encore, try now.
[67:05.45]Is it one to one?
[67:07.97]Because there's a lot of those things.
[67:29.93]Back to the courtyard.
[67:30.65]That means we have to go... Just kind of down and out of here.
[67:33.57]Alright.
[67:33.83]Is there anything else?
[67:34.33]Did I miss anything?
[67:34.79]That's a... Ooh, chem fluid.
[67:40.91]Good thing I stopped.
[67:41.69]Okay.
[67:46.86]Please turn on tips.
[67:47.92]Trust me.
[67:48.34]Focus here.
[67:51.36]Destroy mold cores.
[67:54.42]Oh, I have like a mana bar.
[68:04.10]Hmm.
[68:04.68]What does that do?
[68:06.62]Okay.
[68:07.52]How many times can I do that?
[68:13.10]I'll take the bullets.
[68:16.12]There's another one here.
[68:16.80]Uh-huh.
[68:29.05]So that stops the flow of lava.
[68:34.28]Okay.
[68:36.20]Well, what's over here?
[68:38.24]Anything I can grab?
[68:41.84]Gunpowder, good.
[68:42.94]Anything else?
[68:50.82]Move your camera up.
[68:53.62]Yeah, good call.
[68:57.69]I don't like taking up that much screen real estate, though.
[68:59.47]It's got to be small still.
[69:06.28]Back down to the courtyard.
[69:09.86]Am I alright?
[69:10.28]Did that hurt?
[69:12.92]Fuck, that hurt.
[69:14.04]Oh shit.
[69:15.80]Alright, I think I'm alright.
[69:20.00]I think my knees would have gone up through my shoulders.
[69:23.66]It would have been like... And my knees would be up here.
[69:27.32]You know what I mean?
[69:27.82]They'd be sticking out here.
[69:29.38]And I would be like... Walking around.
[69:31.88]That would be so horrible.
[69:40.12]If I can't get around it, I need to get rid of it.
[69:44.28]So where is it?
[69:44.74]Up here?
[69:45.12]There it is.
[69:49.92]That's an interesting mechanic.
[69:56.52]That's a cool mechanic.
[70:00.73]Where is he?
[70:03.45]Where?
[70:03.71]Alright, where?
[70:04.27]Where?
[70:08.89]Alright.
[70:12.13]Shit.
[70:16.78]I missed way too much.
[70:17.66]I missed two shots.
[70:18.54]I should make some bolts then, right?
[70:30.82]Alright, I got 18 bolts.
[70:35.34]Back to the courtyard, which is just straight through here.
[70:44.30]Hold on.
[70:47.72]I could do that better.
[70:48.42]I just like fucked up my throat.
[70:50.32]What did I just do?
[70:52.90]Mrs. Potts?
[70:54.74]That's the teapot's name, right?
[70:55.74]High capacity magazine.
[71:13.49]Nice.
[71:20.11]What's the teapot's name?
[71:20.85]Is it Mrs. Pot?
[71:23.79]Not Mrs. Puff.
[71:25.21]It's like Mrs. Teapot, right?
[71:28.90]Yeah, I had it, right?
[71:32.84]It's like none of you guys have even played Among Us and it shows.
[72:10.91]I can't, why can I not do this voice today?
[72:13.35]I'm just gonna run.
[72:16.76]I normally would be fine.
[72:28.18]I think it's unlimited.
[72:38.64]Oh, run!
[72:39.28]I need to- Okay, I want to investigate this over here.
[72:50.27]Stupid motherfucker!
[72:52.07]Ugh, I- You know what's- You know, okay.
[73:05.22]You want to know something funny about streaming a video game?
[73:10.32]When you stream a video game, if I miss one shot, I sit there and go, fuck, I can't miss a shot, people are going to make fun of me.
[73:21.07]Do you know what I mean?
[73:21.71]Does that make sense?
[73:23.87]Like, I missed a shot, people are going to omega lull because I missed one bullet, right?
[73:28.17]That's like always up here in the back of my head.
[73:31.58]It's like, oops, oh, you missed one shot.
[73:34.20]Everyone's going to omega lull.
[73:47.04]That looked like I had a hack enabled.
[73:48.68]It was so good.
[73:49.26]Yeah, they're going to omega lull me because I missed one shot, right?
[74:07.69]Okay, I'm just trying to clear this place out because there's definitely things here to get.
[74:09.78]There has to be stuff to collect, right?
[74:13.26]Yeah, there's something in here.
[74:24.27]I cleared all this out.
[74:25.33]What's here?
[74:28.13]Nothing?
[74:29.40]No.
[74:31.10]There's no way.
[74:39.12]a bunch of books.
[74:41.40]Really?
[74:42.90]I really should have just ran.
[74:43.74]I just wasted like 15 bullets for no reason.
[74:46.16]You can Omega L now.
[74:47.58]You can.
[74:50.59]So Omega L bad, right?
[74:51.83]Yeah.
[74:53.45]No, you can do it now.
[74:55.71]For one chem fluid, I spent 10 bullets.
[74:58.76]Great.
[74:58.96]Alright, that's everything in here.
[75:08.40]Is there not one of those here?
[75:09.89]Whatever.
[75:10.17]I feel like I could open this thing.
[75:17.81]Can I open this?
[75:20.77]No.
[75:20.85]So we're going to go back to the courtyard and get one of the masks.
[75:26.52]But not yet.
[75:30.92]What's in here?
[75:36.81]You can't just... Alright, you said so bad for like a full minute now.
[75:41.92]Rendered.
[75:42.54]Remember.
[75:49.50]What was that?
[75:54.57]Okay.
[75:55.87]That looked pretty big.
[75:56.55]All I have is a handgun.
[76:06.77]Alright, I can't do this yet.
[76:17.97]Where was that thing?
[76:25.78]I think this is actually unlimited.
[76:33.46]Gunpowder.
[76:34.86]Very nice.
[76:41.29]Okay.
[76:42.21]Oh, there's a mask.
[76:43.59]What does it say in the back?
[76:49.56]Monocular door deep in the basement.
[76:54.10]It needs this mask.
[76:58.70]Okay.
[77:00.08]Somebody will, one of you guys remember that.
[77:03.46]Open this door.
[77:06.29]Yeah, this is the DLC.
[77:11.42]Okay, I can't do it.
[77:12.12]I think I have to put the mask on and look at it, right?
[77:13.70]If that makes sense to me in my brain.
[77:19.63]Any more of those goo things?
[77:21.79]I don't think so.
[77:23.75]Alright, let's just do it.
[77:24.43]Let's activate the first boss.
[77:25.53]Because that's probably what it is.
[77:35.85]Here we go.
[77:39.28]First let me chug.
[77:45.40]Bronze mask.
[77:49.08]Yeah, OK.
[77:50.05]Need three masks.
[77:54.79]Now let's open the door.
[77:56.03]Over here.
[77:58.35]Can I open this?
[78:12.80]You can't use that here.
[78:13.68]What?
[78:15.74]Do I have to put it on?
[78:24.47]Well, I'm just going to go back to the library or whatever it was.
[78:28.13]Go back to the dining room.
[78:32.87]Open the monocular door.
[78:34.81]Find three masks.
[78:39.59]Oh, equip the extended mag.
[78:41.17]Oops.
[78:45.09]Okay, cool.
[78:45.51]I have an extended mag now.
[78:49.99]I'd rather have health.
[78:52.82]Thank God.
[78:57.20]Why is your face crooked?
[78:59.32]I don't know.
[78:59.78]Ask God.
[79:01.16]Ask God.
[79:01.86]He's the one that drew me and sneezed when he got to my nose and my right side of my face.
[79:05.72]I don't know.
[79:06.23]Ask him.
[79:10.03]Okay, rest.
[79:10.39]Rest.
[79:14.95]What's wrong?
[79:16.61]Why not leave?
[79:17.05]This person is annoying.
[79:18.01]Spawn 10 of them.
[79:19.25]Spawn 10 of these.
[79:43.79]Oh, here's one thing, a fruit punch.
[79:46.01]Like, give me 50 of those.
[79:47.69]Literally just drop them all over the floor.
[79:50.31]Go into your G mod, your Gary's mod tool, whatever, and look down and just hit, like, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q
[80:13.44]Person's evil, whoever it is.
[80:18.44]No, I want you to spawn 20 health packs, and then I want you to spawn two zombies and put rocket ships on their backs, and then activate them so they fly around the room and their arms and legs go everywhere and they smash into the walls and shit.
[80:32.13]Do it now!
[80:32.81]You have the capability, so do it!
[80:34.21]Okay.
[80:44.71]So... Bronze?
[80:50.82]Ooh, it worked.
[80:54.68]What in the Lord's name are you talking about?
[81:01.04]What in the Lord's name?
[81:03.62]Alright.
[81:04.62]So I can get rid of this.
[81:08.09]Let's just do that because it's here.
[81:10.17]I should probably save it.
[81:11.29]Where is there a save point?
[81:13.93]Right here.
[81:16.93]I love Resident Evil games like this.
[81:18.61]The new Resident Evil games are so awesome.
[81:20.49]Do you know why?
[81:21.02]Because I can just press V and know exactly where I am and exactly where I need to go.
[81:28.62]I know exactly what... I don't know.
[81:30.97]I'm not going to get... I'm right here.
[81:32.81]And the red is like, bro, you didn't complete this yet.
[81:35.97]It's like, it's perfect.
[81:38.08]It's like, dude, there's something in here that you can do.
[81:39.84]It's red.
[81:40.90]All the blue?
[81:41.88]Don't even look at this.
[81:42.56]Don't even pay attention to this.
[81:43.28]See this red up here?
[81:44.50]You can go up there, man.
[81:46.95]I love it.
[81:48.47]It's such great design.
[81:57.99]It's literally not.
[82:04.19]Okay, so this opens up back where I was.
[82:07.03]Is this where the Duke guy is?
[82:11.14]Oh my god, these things are everywhere.
[82:17.62]I know you think it's fun to delete my beautiful creatures.
[82:22.53]But you will find out soon enough why that is stupid of you.
[82:27.85]Come on, I know you want to do it.
[82:33.87]Let's just open this.
[82:36.31]Minus two.
[82:39.75]That was not a bad impression, but the dialogue was like an AI writing it.
[82:45.09]Each word was after the next one.
[82:46.71]You know what I mean?
[82:48.25]That was like, oh, I'm like, the substance is not there, but the voice kind of is.
[82:53.62]It was, I'm just saying words after other words and the words don't really connect at all.
[83:02.73]Remember, I'm being speech jammed.
[83:07.51]That's very... That's very stupid of you.
[83:10.33]I just want to hear that back.
[83:13.05]Oh, this is where the Duke sat.
[83:15.64]Remember he was right here?
[83:26.22]There's no way the Duke was sitting in that chair.
[83:30.45]Oh, Christmas lights.
[83:31.13]Okay.
[83:37.80]Mm-hmm.
[83:39.81]Mm-hmm.
[83:46.89]I do not recall a single thing.
[83:48.43]Not who I am, nor how I came to be.
[83:50.31]I know nothing.
[83:51.64]My memories are as broken as the face I hide behind this mask.
[83:55.78]All that remains is this feeling, this hunger, to see others in pain, the despair in their eyes, the sounds of their screams.
[84:01.88]Who will be my next quarry?
[84:03.90]I have my minion to do my bidding.
[84:06.37]He has many faces, but no brains within those skulls.
[84:09.45]He is my best hound, and he will chase those rabbits down.
[84:12.19]Oh, here's the impression, okay.
[84:14.45]Can you hear it?
[84:20.40]I know you think it's fun to delete my beautiful creatures.
[84:25.30]But you will find out soon enough why that is... stupid of you.
[84:40.71]That guy does not have a plan, by the way.
[84:42.93]That guy's over the PA, and he's just like, fuck.
[84:47.02]Oh, I don't have a plan.
[84:48.22]But I gotta make something up to scare this girl?
[84:50.86]Because I got no plan at all.
[84:53.76]Stupid of you.
[84:59.93]One more time.
[85:03.87]That was bad.
[85:04.45]I know you think it's fun to delete my beautiful creatures.
[85:08.11]That was fine.
[85:09.03]That first part is okay.
[85:10.01]And then it was like, what do I say after this?
[85:11.43]I don't know.
[85:12.13]What should I say after this?
[85:14.17]But you will find out soon enough why that is stupid of you.
[85:18.97]But you will find out soon enough.
[85:20.73]Those are all filler words.
[85:22.41]Because right there I was... Let me give you some acting skills.
[85:25.09]Acting class.
[85:26.53]That was me saying nothing to think of what I should actually say after that.
[85:32.86]And what I said after that was not good.
[85:36.02]My brain didn't come up with anything.
[85:37.96]So remember, these are all filler words.
[85:41.72]But you will find out soon enough.
[85:43.30]It's just, I didn't even say those words.
[85:44.88]They came out.
[85:45.58]They just started happening.
[85:46.66]Like, I didn't even say those.
[85:49.54]And you will find out soon enough why that is...
[85:53.56]You can even hear it.
[85:54.16]Listen.
[85:54.60]Listen to my voice.
[85:56.08]I break a little.
[85:58.31]And you will find out why that is stupid.
[86:08.75]Acting 101.
[86:09.98]Do filler words until you actually come up with a thing you want to say.
[86:12.98]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[86:17.32]Down the right hallway, right?
[86:18.86]Like, I don't even know.
[86:20.29]All right, let's go.
[86:24.42]Ooh, the salon.
[86:26.18]God, I love this game!
[86:30.14]Hey!
[86:32.16]Was there something else in here?
[86:37.50]What else is in here that I didn't... Oh, okay.
[86:38.83]It's because this is here.
[86:39.61]I get it.
[86:46.11]So.
[86:47.31]Hmm.
[86:49.17]I can go...
[86:52.69]The main hall is something here.
[86:54.93]That's the actual mask thing.
[86:57.57]Let's just go to the dining room and then into the courtyard?
[87:00.61]Or no, up through here.
[87:02.24]Let's just go this way.
[87:03.90]Can I go this way?
[87:04.56]I can't.
[87:04.94]Alright, well, we'll go up.
[87:07.36]Get it from here.
[87:14.00]I could go through the parlor, but I want to check the dining room?
[87:21.67]Well, down here in this entrance hall, I think.
[87:27.43]Let's do the down there.
[87:28.29]Okay.
[87:38.80]Stay safe.
[87:39.56]Are you spawning more stuff for me?
[87:45.47]I'm trying, but it's hard when I'm being hunted by a demented giant and his creepy minions.
[87:50.73]Well, try this.
[87:52.25]And then, like, 30 Combine spawn in this room.
[87:56.37]Get him.
[87:56.99]Throw away that kid.
[87:58.88]Pick up that kid.
[88:00.12]I'm just getting swarmed.
[88:02.30]Okay, so then... How do I get...
[88:17.01]I gotta go down here.
[88:17.71]Because this is locked.
[88:20.05]Alright, yeah.
[88:21.00]Alright.
[88:21.56]I know where I'm going.
[88:22.72]Up.
[88:23.08]Left.
[88:24.08]Left.
[88:26.80]Yes.
[88:27.32]Up.
[88:27.86]Left.
[88:28.12]Okay.
[88:31.29]Left.
[88:31.51]Left.
[88:37.19]Left.
[88:40.60]You got teleported to GM Flatgrass.
[88:45.66]Okay, then left, straight.
[88:52.46]There we go.
[88:53.30]Oh, thank God for awesome game design.
[89:04.39]Okay.
[89:06.83]Did I miss anything here?
[89:10.33]I don't think I missed anything here.
[89:13.67]I will check.
[89:19.11]What's this?
[89:21.99]Safe here.
[89:22.62]Ooh, thanks for the chem fluid.
[89:28.74]Tired?
[89:29.14]Weak here.
[89:40.71]Yes.
[89:43.10]Here, have a pack of cigarettes.
[89:48.32]Okay, handgun ammo?
[89:56.55]Okay.
[89:57.75]I don't think I can do anything else here.
[90:02.25]I can't.
[90:03.73]So where do I go from here?
[90:06.27]Up through the parlor.
[90:09.08]That sounds like a plan to me.
[90:24.17]So then we go up, left, right.
[90:32.86]Is Lady Dimitrisou here?
[90:39.16]Right?
[90:39.92]I can't go through here.
[90:43.67]Shit.
[90:44.15]Wait.
[90:50.35]What the fuck was that?
[91:03.49]Is there a typewriter in here?
[91:04.23]Okay, so wait.
[91:06.57]So where the hell do I go?
[91:07.44]It was all in there.
[91:35.65]Upstairs.
[91:38.21]Oh, because I took the goo away.
[91:39.65]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[91:40.79]I remember.
[91:44.38]I completely forgot I did that.
[91:54.70]Map.
[91:56.52]Alright, there's a key in the dressing room.
[92:00.36]Let's just take a look around.
[92:07.13]Can these be broken?
[92:14.59]If you're going to pause it, I have to pee.
[92:18.91]I'm sorry, I can't.
[92:24.92]Oh, okay, so I was in here.
[92:26.84]This is the room with Mrs. Potts.
[92:29.52]Okay, so this waiting room is the Mrs. Potts room.
[92:34.24]I'll keep that up here.
[92:37.54]Pause it.
[92:37.94]I'm not doing anything.
[92:39.44]We're just kind of walking around exploring.
[92:43.50]Handgun ammo.
[92:53.80]I need that shotgun.
[92:54.64]Okay.
[93:02.15]Down this hall.
[93:05.53]All right.
[93:09.31]All right.
[93:12.71]All right.
[93:38.23]You're just doing Al Pacino?
[93:42.15]Come on!
[93:43.59]Come on!
[93:45.96]You're right.
[93:46.36]Holy shit.
[93:48.38]That's just doing Al Pacino without talking.
[93:50.36]Okay, it's on the other side of the door.
[94:03.03]Nope, it's right there.
[94:08.85]Thermal fleas, my bladder.
[94:10.11]Whoa!
[94:21.87]Wow, what the?
[94:22.53]I just hit my head on the fucking ceiling?
[94:24.91]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[94:25.89]Oh, thanks for the arrow.
[94:27.63]That didn't help at all.
[94:28.67]Throw a grenade behind me.
[94:33.04]You need to go that way.
[94:34.64]That's the only door in the room, dude.
[94:38.50]Manifest fucking spikes on the ground.
[94:43.28]Those things chase me in here, but where is it?
[94:45.98]I'm not binocular key.
[94:47.72]I'm supposed to be here somewhere.
[94:48.66]It's not in this room though.
[94:49.60]It must be close by.
[94:54.77]Go that way.
[94:59.66]Don't go.
[95:00.32]Too weak.
[95:02.78]Okay.
[95:05.04]He's in this room.
[95:06.28]Oh, wait.
[95:07.20]Behind fireplace.
[95:14.80]Alright, but is there anything else in this room?
[95:16.20]I don't think so.
[95:22.41]Okay, you can mess with the actual physical world.
[95:36.65]I just so badly want to hear, like, in the very far distance, a bunch of... Like, oh, it's ten aliens versus ten Combine.
[95:46.74]Right?
[95:47.68]Oh, it's like 10, uh, like, Gordon Freeman scientist people versus, like, two Gordon Freemans.
[96:02.89]Source engine joke Andy.
[96:08.63]We're on that.
[96:09.27]Yeah, I'm on that today.
[96:11.01]I'm on that.
[96:12.89]So what did that do?
[96:18.93]stronger now okay source engine andy focus on enemy okay so is that it I did that I did that all right focus on an ir okay so it freezes them kind of
[96:47.57]Halt enemy movements.
[96:50.88]Go, go, go, go, go.
[96:53.80]He's behind me.
[96:55.54]This too.
[96:58.98]Sprig of white sage.
[97:04.11]An herb that restores some mutamycite power.
[97:07.05]I don't want to use this right now.
[97:10.13]It's making me do it.
[97:11.05]Okay.
[97:13.36]Is it only one?
[97:14.00]So I have slots now.
[97:21.77]Okay.
[97:24.81]Be careful.
[97:27.81]Open the door.
[97:28.87]And where am I going from here?
[97:31.05]I'm going... Right, left.
[97:41.58]Okay.
[97:41.84]All right.
[97:42.12]All right.
[97:42.40]All right.
[97:42.66]All right.
[97:43.06]What's in here?
[97:43.44]What's in here?
[97:43.82]What's in here?
[97:44.24]Take a look.
[97:44.58]Take a look.
[97:45.86]What's in here?
[97:46.18]What's in here?
[97:46.70]What's in here?
[97:51.93]Key, key, key, key, key, key.
[97:53.75]All right.
[97:54.31]Somebody else will read this.
[97:55.03]Just screenshot it.
[97:55.61]All right, I'll read it.
[98:21.16]Alright, now we're gonna go... Straight, right, right, right, left, right.
[98:25.72]Straight, right, right, right, left, right.
[98:27.34]Straight.
[98:28.84]Right.
[98:31.06]Right.
[98:39.34]Oh, come on.
[98:45.72]Bleh!
[98:47.98]Straight, right, right, right, right, right, left, right.
[98:49.59]Straight, right.
[98:53.63]Straight.
[98:58.38]Oh, I forgot how to play.
[98:59.38]Oh, come on.
[99:05.98]I can't.
[99:06.48]Just kill them.
[99:06.93]I have to kill them.
[99:17.14]Wait, what's happening?
[99:19.70]Get off me.
[99:20.87]How do I stop this?
[99:21.77]Shoot.
[99:26.57]I can't shoot the gun.
[99:31.26]What are you doing?
[99:32.12]Use the heel.
[99:34.68]Why did she just like surf on a surfboard?
[99:46.69]I was like.
[99:57.62]All right, let's go.
[100:01.36]Give me all this shit.
[100:03.22]I didn't pick up any of this, by the way.
[100:05.50]I'm not going to even use it.
[100:07.80]I have to.
[100:12.38]I got everything.
[100:13.52]All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[100:15.16]This time, don't be an idiot.
[100:21.43]Take this.
[100:22.45]Uh-huh.
[100:22.99]You use that.
[100:26.14]Replenish.
[100:27.38]Okay.
[100:29.02]Back to where I just was.
[100:30.48]Now this bullshit.
[100:31.66]I can't go down that hallway.
[100:33.16]So let me just do this first.
[100:40.79]So let me get these items and then get out.
[100:42.31]I need to aggro them first.
[100:48.61]Because I'll get stuck.
[100:53.44]You guys need to be together.
[100:54.26]Get together!
[100:57.03]Get- Stop swarming around me!
[100:58.73]Alright, that's it?
[101:06.63]Let's go.
[101:07.07]Alright, so I can't go- I gotta go the other way.
[101:09.86]I can't go this way, right?
[101:13.50]It's like this, and then can I go over here?
[101:17.42]No, so I can go this way, right?
[101:18.96]Go!
[101:24.57]Move out of the way.
[101:26.35]Get out of the way, please.
[101:29.40]Okay.
[101:36.38]Move.
[101:39.96]What are you doing?
[101:41.41]Okay.
[101:41.87]I'm gonna go right.
[101:56.55]Nice.
[101:56.81]Am I safe here?
[101:59.22]Alright, we got animals.
[102:04.72]Painting of a butterfly.
[102:05.66]The picture is fixed in place and can't be removed.
[102:07.90]I need a painting.
[102:16.59]Okay, spider painting.
[102:18.99]Okay, so... Butterfly... Spider eats the butterfly.
[102:22.93]Frog eats the spider.
[102:27.41]Goat eats the frog.
[102:31.19]Wolf eats the goat.
[102:34.89]I think that's accurate.
[102:37.87]I think that's what it wants me to do, right?
[102:43.19]Goat eats the frog?
[102:44.13]I don't know.
[102:45.27]What do goats eat?
[102:46.13]No, actually goats are like vegetarian.
[102:50.60]Oh, sheep.
[102:51.44]Wait, do sheep eat frogs?
[102:53.06]I don't... Somebody's coming in the door.
[103:04.33]Okay, this can't be moved either.
[103:05.61]Okay, so... The... The frog... What does that say?
[103:20.30]I fear the stealthy one.
[103:21.86]It will surely bind and suffocate me.
[103:23.85]Okay, so the frog is scared of the spider.
[103:25.87]Okay, so the butterfly is scared of the frog, because the frog will eat the butterfly.
[103:34.88]The frog is scared of the spider.
[103:37.12]Whom is very stealthy.
[103:41.04]Then... The... Sheep is scared of the... Sheep likes to eat the spider.
[103:48.23]The extra protein.
[103:51.21]Um... We fear the snarling beast.
[103:58.89]They will surely tear us to shreds.
[104:02.95]So right here.
[104:09.72]Okay.
[104:10.32]Frog eats the butterfly.
[104:12.19]Spider eats the frog.
[104:14.43]Something eats the spider.
[104:18.31]And then sheep is afraid of the... Whatever, though.
[104:20.47]Okay.
[104:22.69]The predators stand united, each staring to... Oh.
[104:30.09]Should have read the instructions first.
[104:41.76]That's it right there.
[104:43.64]Lion eats the sheep.
[104:46.46]Frog is eaten by that.
[104:48.42]And then what eats the butterfly?
[104:58.70]The wolf, whatever.
[105:01.52]What about the spider's description?
[105:05.76]I didn't read that.
[105:06.36]You're right.
[105:11.02]No notes.
[105:13.87]They need to stare down their prey.
[105:15.97]Isn't this accurate?
[105:17.63]Stop trying to come in here.
[105:18.93]I think I'm missing a painting.
[105:21.87]I think I have to come back in here.
[105:23.61]I'm missing a painting.
[105:29.89]Okay, well, that's fine.
[105:31.87]Where am I going from here?
[105:35.29]I have the key...
[105:42.88]Okay, I can open the monocular door.
[105:46.67]The monocular door was downstairs.
[105:51.13]Right here.
[105:51.79]Alright, I gotta go back to the courtyard.
[105:53.41]So let's get down the stairs.
[106:07.14]You look AI generated.
[106:08.24]That's fine.
[106:14.20]OK, so from here I gotta go straight ahead and then to the right.
[106:18.96]Save it.
[106:22.90]Is he serious right now?
[106:25.56]What?
[106:32.05]Oh, another present.
[106:34.35]Don't push so hard.
[106:35.53]I can't not push myself.
[106:42.86]This is gonna be Ethan or something, right?
[106:46.60]Give up?
[106:47.74]Who's she talking to?
[106:49.12]Alright, now spawn me a chem packet.
[106:51.42]No chem packet spawn?
[107:18.22]35 bullets.
[107:22.70]35 bullets.
[107:25.32]Okay.
[107:28.14]I can't do that yet.
[107:29.62]Wait.
[107:31.40]Is this that key?
[107:34.20]No.
[107:35.65]No, it's not.
[107:38.73]It has stuff on the sides.
[107:39.99]Let's keep moving.
[107:46.19]Ooh, I can do this.
[107:49.62]Any more of these?
[107:50.10]Only four handgun ammo.
[107:54.10]Alright, this is all on the other side.
[108:07.76]That's on the right side.
[108:08.60]Oh, hold on.
[108:19.72]What's in here?
[108:30.61]Nothing?
[108:33.15]Oh, okay.
[108:36.03]Am I injured?
[108:36.65]Why am I running weird?
[108:45.67]Oh, it's just a shortcut back to here.
[108:46.87]Okay.
[108:46.99]All right.
[108:54.25]that door is over here can you give a tldr of what the plot is uh yes so uh I sat down at a on a bench and there's some guy he's like hey you know that people like apparently people don't like make fun of me because I have like superpowers I was like hey you know there's a way to get rid of those superpowers if you'd go and as I have this lab and there's these notes that somebody left that like you can remove those powers so you just are kind of a you go back to being a regular person you don't have powers anymore
[109:23.58]uh so I touched this thing that was supposed to be this thing that gets me into the memories of um of the mutant my seat or something and that's where we are oh you're quite the tricksy little rabbit to have made it this far the next mask however won't be nearly as easy to get your grubby paws on
[109:58.48]Okay.
[110:04.26]Dude, that Resident Evil 4 remake, I think, could be, like, the best game ever made.
[110:08.97]I really hope it is.
[110:10.35]Resident Evil 2, the Resident Evil 3 remake was, was okay.
[110:13.27]It was not, okay, it was okay.
[110:17.63]god the resident evil 2 remake is one of the best remakes I've ever played that was game of the year for me when it came out that game was so phenomenal it was awesome I hope that it's the resident evil team to team he hates elden ring no it's gonna I'm telling you if resident evil 4 is it coming out this year
[110:45.34]Resident Evil 4 doesn't need a remake.
[110:46.70]Resident Evil 2 did need a remake.
[110:50.96]Yeah, it's interesting because when I saw the gameplay trailer for Resident Evil 4, my eyes were kind of squinting.
[110:56.71]I was like, wait, this is not the game.
[110:59.77]I thought it was just a remaster.
[111:01.21]I was like, oh, it's just a fresh coat of paint, but the whole thing is redone.
[111:05.27]It's weird to look at.
[111:06.17]It's like, whoa, wait a minute.
[111:08.57]This is not just a remaster.
[111:11.01]They redid the whole entire game.
[111:12.95]It's really weird to look at.
[111:16.27]Welcome to the Gallery of Despair.
[111:18.08]A wondrous display of those few who succeeded in obtaining at least one mask.
[111:24.98]Set your sights upon those chosen few whose final moments of despair are preserved forever in this gallery.
[111:30.82]Witnessing this collection of the light of life from a different perspective.
[111:36.00]So these are all the roses that made it this far.
[111:41.95]So I'm one of these roses, and I got to this point, but they didn't make it.
[111:46.72]But I did, and we'll see if I make it, in quotes.
[111:51.52]I understand the story so far.
[111:55.00]Weird.
[111:55.72]Okay.
[112:02.12]It's locked.
[112:04.82]I'm going to get grabbed.
[112:05.54]There's no way.
[112:07.32]Any aliasing?
[112:08.84]Yep.
[112:11.20]Tons of aliasing.
[112:29.25]Jesus.
[112:30.05]Oh, that one lit.
[113:00.32]arrows the remake does look really good it just looks it's just the game that I remember loving but it's been like turned up a couple of notches I just hope they don't change too much I hope it's just like a full-on let's like squash the bugs let's make it cool looking let's make it really high quality looking there really weren't even any bugs that game was almost perfect wasn't it
[113:30.24]Although I've just drowned, the arrows bite doth sting.
[113:34.12]They hanged me long ago, yet I feel everything.
[113:37.24]But still the worst, nor last, nor first, the sharpened blade did ring.
[113:44.30]They hanged me long ago.
[113:45.50]Wait, they hanged me long ago, so that's like the choking one.
[113:53.02]But still the worst, nor last, nor first.
[113:56.98]Okay, a long ago I choked, and then I drowned.
[114:02.64]No, okay, I choked, then I drowned, and the arrows hit me.
[114:06.72]And then, okay, I choked, I drowned, and the arrows hit me.
[114:14.41]Okay, I choked, I drowned, and the arrows hit me.
[114:25.67]What?
[114:28.29]The choking happens first.
[114:32.43]Although I've just drowned.
[114:33.39]Alright, so I just drowned.
[114:34.49]Okay, so I'm choking, then I got stabbed, then the arrows, then I just drowned.
[114:44.49]Okay.
[114:58.41]Okay, yep.
[114:59.39]And I get hit with the arrows.
[115:01.30]And then I just drowned.
[115:02.64]I just drowned right now.
[115:04.78]Yeah.
[115:07.58]Other way around, apparently.
[115:14.28]Choked.
[115:15.20]Stabbed.
[115:17.45]Arrows.
[115:18.25]No.
[115:18.59]Then I just... Wait, what?
[115:19.97]Did I fuck it up?
[115:21.11]Yeah, this way.
[115:22.21]Then I drown and the arrows hit me.
[115:26.61]Yeah, okay.
[115:27.33]That's it.
[115:36.16]Dude, there's only 16 possible combinations.
[115:38.04]Come on.
[115:47.80]Okay, cool.
[115:49.08]This is going down.
[115:50.00]I don't know if I want to go down here just yet.
[115:53.51]If I'm very honest.
[115:55.13]I think I want to see if there's any other places I can go here.
[116:00.37]Which there is.
[116:01.43]I can go down to the hall and to the left.
[116:09.97]Good.
[116:12.38]Super creepy.
[116:13.70]Super creepy.
[116:17.72]Okay, it's locked.
[116:18.52]This is super creepy.
[116:22.80]So let's go down.
[116:23.70]Turn the light on.
[116:54.96]You need to save?
[116:57.30]I do need to save, you're right.
[116:58.58]I'll just make sure I don't die.
[116:59.46]I have a ton of ammo, so I'll be fine.
[117:01.85]I save that now, but... Might be a dumb thing to say.
[117:06.39]Oh, goddammit.
[117:16.15]What's in here?
[117:44.37]Don't run.
[117:44.97]Running is the worst thing I could do right now.
[117:47.07]Ah!
[117:54.96]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[117:56.26]Okay, um... The silver mask is in the small room in the back.
[117:59.18]I'm so close.
[117:59.82]Alright, I need to hide somewhere?
[118:14.98]This dude can't crawl, right?
[118:16.13]I hope not.
[118:50.26]Oh shit.
[118:51.08]Alright.
[118:55.23]Can I do this through the wall?
[119:00.42]Did you see me?
[119:19.90]It's not even fucking scary.
[119:21.32]Why is all this saliva in my mouth?
[119:28.26]What are you doing?
[119:28.87]What's that?
[119:30.71]You can't throw something, right?
[119:40.75]Where are you going?
[119:42.98]Wait, what?
[119:44.54]What, did you get stronger?
[119:45.50]Did you get bigger?
[119:47.08]I think he grew in size.
[119:52.71]I just have to run by him, I think.
[119:54.71]Okay, we're gonna go for it.
[120:00.57]Haha, you despawned.
[120:02.13]Stupid.
[120:05.45]Pipe bomb.
[120:10.60]Oh, where'd he go?
[120:12.50]Okay, pipe bomb.
[120:14.10]How do I... I need to put this on shortcut.
[120:16.38]On three.
[120:21.58]Where are you?
[120:28.83]Run, run!
[120:32.21]Oh my god, don't freak out.
[120:34.08]Where is he?
[120:41.22]Good job.
[120:41.64]He runs pretty fast.
[120:46.95]Do I have any more pipe bombs?
[120:49.17]I only had one pipe bomb.
[120:50.23]Are you shitting me?
[120:59.44]Don't even start with this bullshit.
[121:04.89]Oh no!
[121:08.51]Get off me!
[121:09.03]Get off me!
[121:09.39]Get off me!
[121:32.19]Oh, you piece of shit.
[121:43.99]Okay, we're good.
[121:44.43]He's gonna break through this wall in three, two... Okay, I'm good.
[122:03.65]Okay.
[122:04.29]Okay.
[122:04.85]Come down the stairs!
[122:08.25]Ah!
[122:10.29]Ah!
[122:41.95]Am I going the right way?
[122:42.81]I missed an item.
[122:44.86]It doesn't matter.
[122:45.56]Just go.
[122:46.14]It's probably a fucking... Fuck.
[122:54.40]I can't go back.
[122:55.86]I need to go back, and then I need to eventually get where I have to go.
[122:59.56]How do I get out of here?
[123:03.96]Guys, I...
[123:11.06]Get off me!
[123:11.36]Get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off!
[123:20.35]Where's this item that I missed?
[123:25.95]I missed an item in here.
[123:27.77]Where is it?
[123:28.89]Oh, he can come through the fucking back window!
[123:31.97]Oh, I forgot that was open.
[123:33.63]Oh, I'm in a tru- I'm in trouble.
[123:34.93]It's over.
[123:35.47]Game's over.
[123:45.93]God damn it.
[123:58.39]Oh, come on, man.
[124:00.39]It's not fair.
[124:01.95]It's not fair.
[124:09.45]It's not fair.
[124:10.47]It's actually not fair.
[124:12.07]I mean, it's actually not fair.
[124:13.67]It's not fair.
[124:14.19]I can't fucking go down here.
[124:23.31]out of my way.
[124:24.51]He's... Don't you dare body block me.
[124:34.05]Just let me out.
[124:34.83]Just get me out of here.
[124:36.43]This is Dark Souls level of collision.
[124:39.03]Are you kidding me?
[124:40.27]That's fucking bullshit.
[124:43.06]Where's the item I missed?
[124:49.42]I don't care.
[124:49.98]I gotta get out of here.
[124:58.28]I wasted so much shit.
[124:59.48]I almost want to die.
[125:08.30]Get out.
[125:09.28]Get out.
[125:09.80]Come on, man.
[125:12.24]Something on the ground.
[125:17.31]Crouch.
[125:17.75]What are you thinking?
[125:18.95]What are you... I'm actually fucking pissed.
[125:21.15]Crouch, you stupid motherfucker.
[125:22.95]What's happening right now?
[125:31.84]Dude, the collision hit window is so huge.
[125:42.07]That guy's staff was blocking the entire left side of the doorway.
[125:52.58]I had so much health.
[125:57.62]I'm not using it.
[126:05.75]Well, I got the mask, so we're good.
[126:12.17]I don't want to die here.
[126:14.43]This is a huge problem because I'm saved.
[126:18.31]I need to use the heal.
[126:19.65]Yeah, look at all this horse shit.
[126:23.27]I have to.
[126:30.83]If that guy shows up again and I get one swipe, I'm dead.
[126:36.46]This is a jar now.
[126:38.96]Oh, thank god.
[126:45.16]I got the mask.
[126:45.72]Don't fight, just run.
[126:50.27]Here, take this.
[126:51.63]Okay.
[127:05.88]Is this pre-recorded?
[127:07.16]No.
[127:14.00]Two out of three.
[127:14.90]Cool.
[127:22.97]Can you just help a little bit more?
[127:24.85]I'm gonna wait till I get some more stuff.
[127:33.62]Alright, so now...
[127:36.05]I can... Is this open?
[127:38.41]It's unlocked.
[127:39.15]Okay, that leads out to here.
[127:41.09]No items, no.
[127:54.30]I think this is two, so I'm gonna use... Yeah, it's two.
[128:01.48]You better finish tonight.
[128:03.80]I don't think there's a world where I don't finish this in the next, like, hour and 20 minutes.
[128:06.89]There we go.
[128:19.86]Okay.
[128:21.48]I don't need ammo right now, so I'm going to hold on to it.
[128:22.92]You're going to spend six hours on a three hour long DLC.
[128:26.73]I mean, unless there's anything really, really more than the third mask and kind of the last bits.
[128:34.39]I don't know.
[128:35.11]We'll see.
[128:36.26]It's been fun so far.
[128:50.02]Rusted scrap.
[128:51.86]You can now craft new items.
[128:53.78]Use the craft command in your tab.
[128:56.34]Shotgun shells are gunpowder plus rusted scrap.
[129:00.10]Pipe bombs are rusted scrap, gunpowder, and herbs.
[129:03.30]Alright, we're back here.
[129:15.53]This is pre-recorded.
[129:17.65]It's... Stop talking!
[129:26.87]This is back out to this weird area.
[129:30.41]Alright, so I have the second mask.
[129:43.92]Alright, this is this room, which I don't need to do anymore.
[129:45.92]I got the mask.
[129:50.50]We had to... Oh, wait.
[129:51.41]What about down here?
[129:54.95]Can't move this.
[130:06.10]Might as well.
[130:10.39]Alright, so I can't open that door, so I'm gonna go back to the... I gotta go downstairs.
[130:19.49]Snake painting.
[130:20.11]Cool.
[130:20.35]Alright, so where's that painting room?
[130:23.23]You let us bet.
[130:30.64]Say something.
[130:31.06]What?
[130:31.78]What?
[130:40.37]There were a big amount of subs.
[130:44.05]I appreciate it.
[130:44.61]I really do.
[130:45.97]Thank you so much.
[130:46.67]I really do.
[130:47.35]But I don't shout out subs anymore.
[130:50.08]Or bits.
[130:50.36]I don't do it.
[130:54.44]I really appreciate it though.
[130:57.10]I don't shout out bits or subs anymore because I don't.
[131:02.08]Do I have to go through this?
[131:02.78]Should I go through this?
[131:05.87]It was 50 subs.
[131:06.93]It's a lot of subs.
[131:07.61]It is.
[131:09.01]I appreciate it.
[131:10.61]But I don't shout out subs or bits anymore.
[131:14.80]I just don't.
[131:15.16]It was a decision I made a couple years ago.
[131:17.28]And I have to stick to it.
[131:22.34]I am sorry if you want me to address big amounts of subs and bits.
[131:28.17]But if I do that, let's say I start only addressing the ones that are 50 or 100 subs or something like that, right?
[131:36.60]That incentivizes people that, oh, well, that's now he'll... It incentivizes people to give more.
[131:41.96]Because if I don't say the person that subbed just for one month or whatever, but if you do give 100 subs, I will see it and I'll talk about it.
[131:50.22]So that's kind of why.
[131:51.26]And honestly, I don't want to...
[131:53.54]I don't want to put pressure on the community or myself, if I'm honest, too.
[131:57.78]Because I really don't want the stream, like I've talked about years in the past, but we'll bring it up again.
[132:04.13]I don't want you to be essentially incentivized to pay me money for me to say something or talk to you.
[132:10.63]I don't like that.
[132:11.47]I never have.
[132:14.36]I think it's kind of healthier if you decide that you're...
[132:19.78]If you like the stream and you want to sub, then that's all there is to it, right?
[132:22.96]Or if you want to give gifts to the subs, I'd really appreciate it.
[132:26.36]But I don't really want to turn the stream into a way to incentivize... Oh, well, if I give 50 subs or 100 subs, then he'll talk.
[132:36.37]He'll bring it up.
[132:38.65]And let me be very, very clear to whoever just gave 50 subs.
[132:41.53]That's fucking amazing.
[132:44.95]That's... Thank you.
[132:46.55]But I, you know, I don't want to just... You know what I'm saying.
[132:51.49]You get it.
[132:51.77]He doesn't want your money.
[132:56.52]I would rather you buy yourself a fucking nice new pair of shoes.
[133:01.18]Alright.
[133:04.80]I need to... I did the thing where I walked in a circle and talked for two minutes, so we gotta go this way.
[133:20.60]How do I even get back there?
[133:22.22]Oh, there we go.
[133:22.78]Like this, right?
[133:24.74]Yes.
[133:25.16]No?
[133:27.69]How do I get back to the stairs?
[133:28.73]I have to go all the way around, don't I?
[133:30.67]Because I can't go... Oh, no, no, no.
[133:34.65]It's right here.
[133:35.61]Because I can't go through here.
[133:39.93]So how do I... Get... I have to go this way?
[133:49.51]And then... No.
[133:54.61]How do I get back over here?
[134:05.74]Because this goes to out here.
[134:13.44]Oh, okay.
[134:13.90]I can unlock this door.
[134:14.90]Cool.
[134:20.37]Okay.
[134:20.75]Cool.
[134:21.03]Let's go.
[134:24.13]Three-arrow DLC.
[134:25.39]Pepe laugh.
[134:31.13]The thing's back, isn't it?
[134:47.48]Persistent little rabbit, aren't you?
[134:50.44]But you cannot simply do as you please.
[134:53.50]There's only one more mask.
[135:07.88]Oh, goddammit.
[135:08.66]Alright, so I gotta go left and put the mask on.
[135:23.70]Okay, and then... Wait, can I get the shotgun?
[135:36.99]No, I can't.
[135:39.33]I need... Where's that painting room?
[135:45.83]Wait, the painting room is upstairs in the gallery.
[135:48.39]Okay.
[135:50.09]Let's go.
[135:55.62]Put this here, go do the painting, and then... Something on that?
[136:01.28]No.
[136:06.83]Mask won't fit there.
[136:07.75]This one here?
[136:13.02]No, not the snake painting.
[136:15.68]Hang the snake painting here.
[136:23.74]One more.
[136:42.21]It's up and into the gallery.
[136:45.35]It's probably going to be for the key, right?
[136:46.63]Yeah.
[136:52.89]What is that?
[136:53.25]I thought something was on the ceiling.
[136:57.58]Okay, so the predator.
[137:01.84]What does a snake eat?
[137:09.70]Snake eat the frog?
[137:13.74]mouse a snake does not eat this right I hate that okay it's probably the frog but snakes don't eat butterflies so who eats okay
[137:41.85]They have to be across from each other.
[137:43.71]This one can't move and this one can't move.
[137:45.37]So that's accurate, right?
[137:51.05]This one's also accurate.
[137:55.08]But somehow it's not.
[138:08.14]Because then this would be...
[138:11.91]Yeah, okay.
[138:15.26]Spider doesn't eat frogs.
[138:21.02]Hey, can you please make it say Resident Evil Village?
[138:25.06]Every time something big happens, it would be very atmospheric.
[138:33.47]You make that joke, and you say that to me.
[138:36.13]But back in the day, the first, like, five iterations of this series, when you pressed start, it did that.
[138:44.30]Resident Evil 3.
[138:47.18]So, come on.
[138:51.49]The Tricular Emblem begets glory.
[138:54.11]Unto thee... I couldn't read that.
[138:57.81]Unto thee the golden mask shall be granted.
[139:03.62]Alright, so the shotgun room was... I think on the first floor, right?
[139:12.47]Yeah, okay.
[139:12.95]So first floor, in between the main hall.
[139:14.99]I'm gonna save it.
[139:16.87]The big guy's probably gonna be right here.
[139:32.16]And it's where is it over here, right?
[139:37.02]Through the... Where is it?
[139:44.77]Wasn't it just on the screen?
[139:47.05]Wait, I'm confused.
[139:47.69]What just happened?
[139:49.35]Do you eat spiders?
[139:50.35]I don't.
[139:55.25]Okay, so now we go to the dining room, right?
[139:57.15]I think.
[139:59.87]Yep.
[140:03.94]This dude eats roaches.
[140:05.20]I don't.
[140:17.74]Okay, shotgun.
[140:20.04]Hell yeah.
[140:23.20]Nice.
[140:23.58]Alright, let me make some bullets for it.
[140:28.36]Shotgun ammo.
[140:33.32]Alright, don't use this.
[140:38.55]Only use this when I'm in an emergency.
[140:44.11]I'm gonna make... Hold on to the fluid.
[140:49.49]I don't need it.
[140:51.41]That's what?
[140:52.01]Two?
[140:52.27]Okay, two is the shotgun.
[140:55.15]So now, that door is up there.
[140:59.70]Can I go in the kitchen yet?
[141:00.64]Let me try to go in the kitchen.
[141:01.72]I feel like there might be something there.
[141:04.69]That's it.
[141:04.97]I'm making it up.
[141:05.61]I'm not even scared.
[141:07.52]I went the wrong way.
[141:10.44]Okay, so... Can I go in this kitchen?
[141:27.91]The door is locked, but can I get in here?
[141:31.01]No.
[141:31.35]Okay.
[141:31.53]Let's check in.
[141:37.50]Stop interrupting the gameplay.
[141:42.65]I'll activate the mute streamer when the gameplay is active, okay?
[141:46.39]I understand.
[141:46.85]I get it.
[141:48.39]You want to make sure that you can hear...
[142:09.29]Oh, the fuck?
[142:12.55]Okay, well, I'm not going that way.
[142:14.53]Because that's kind of dangerous.
[142:16.51]So we're going to go this way, through the dining room.
[142:19.99]Wait, is it through that way?
[142:21.42]I have to go through the courtyard.
[142:22.60]Shit.
[142:26.22]Okay.
[142:26.54]You know how we do on this channel?
[142:29.40]We sing a note when we want to make sure we don't scare ourselves.
[142:55.82]I held that for so fucking long.
[143:03.81]Okay, we're... This is not it?
[143:12.33]It's on the bottom floor.
[143:13.39]What?
[143:20.65]Oh, there are too many people here for me to do that.
[143:31.74]There are far too many people here for me to do what I just did.
[143:36.22]Too many people have watched it.
[143:44.37]Oh, the mask is right here.
[143:45.67]Okay.
[143:49.44]Something's gonna spawn in this room.
[143:52.98]And it's gonna be really scary.
[144:05.83]Is that the last mask?
[144:08.05]Looks like it.
[144:13.55]Think I'm too far away.
[144:21.04]Okay, well obviously I have to do that, so... Okay.
[144:36.87]Are you kidding me?
[144:37.69]Dude!
[144:45.68]No, don't step in it!
[144:46.50]Don't step in it!
[144:46.98]I haven't saved in like a... Alright, I have to kill these guys.
[144:50.92]Where's the other thing?
[144:55.24]Shit!
[144:56.00]Hold on.
[144:56.54]I gotta... I have to stand on the... Hurry!
[145:14.43]Come on!
[145:17.29]What is going on right now?
[145:19.15]Why did it not fall?
[145:20.03]There's one more.
[145:28.54]Dude, where?
[145:32.20]I think I have to go up.
[145:36.04]There must be more cores in here.
[145:47.96]I can't get in here.
[145:50.75]Did he just talk?
[145:51.79]Yeah, he kind of was just like... That has to be a place I can stand, right?
[146:16.35]I don't think so.
[146:17.95]I gotta go on the balcony and look over.
[146:26.76]Yeah, so how do I... Where's the balcony?
[146:28.02]I think that's what I have to do.
[146:34.37]Is that right?
[146:42.83]I think it... No.
[146:44.95]Don't I have to go on that balcony and look down?
[146:49.43]I guess not.
[146:51.45]Really?
[146:51.71]How am I supposed to see that?
[146:58.46]There's stairs in the creepy room.
[146:59.80]Are there stairs in here?
[147:21.02]Uh-huh, there are.
[147:34.64]Where is that?
[147:35.52]Where is it?
[147:40.12]Oh my god!
[148:07.98]Going on a quick item run.
[148:12.54]OK.
[148:14.62]Quick item run.
[148:18.58]This unlocked.
[148:22.67]OK, where is it?
[148:33.65]Did I not get the other guy?
[148:35.07]I think I'm good.
[148:36.03]Yep, let's run through here just because, fuck it, let's get some items.
[148:46.68]God!
[148:47.16]Okay, I'm fine.
[148:50.82]There's still stuff I'm missing, but whatever.
[149:17.94]Golden mask.
[149:32.65]Easy peasy.
[149:47.28]Alright, so there's another Rose come down to the beginning.
[150:07.52]What a shame.
[150:13.74]You were but a hop, a skip, and a jump away from claiming your crystalline prize.
[150:20.52]I knew the real Rose would be so much more lively.
[150:24.76]It would be a shame to snuff you out so unceremoniously.
[150:29.52]Shall we prolong our fun a little longer?
[150:33.28]Oh, come now, don't pout.
[150:35.76]I've prepared a nice little diversion for you.
[150:38.74]Okay.
[150:41.04]So many Squirosia.
[150:44.06]Nearly all of them are counterfeit.
[150:47.70]Do you think you can suss out the real ones?
[150:52.51]Time is running out, little one.
[150:55.21]Tick tock, tick tock.
[150:57.45]It's this one.
[150:58.17]You'll be swallowed right up if you don't hurry.
[151:02.03]How am I supposed to tell the difference?
[151:07.61]Whoopsie.
[151:08.63]You need a more discerning eye, my dear.
[151:12.34]I'll help.
[151:13.97]Okay.
[151:15.15]So which one is it?
[151:19.71]Right?
[151:20.95]Lower than barrel left?
[151:24.05]Lower than barrel.
[151:25.68]Right, left, lower than barrel.
[151:27.38]Where's the barrel?
[151:28.34]This one?
[151:31.52]You're not even close.
[151:37.63]Lower than barrel.
[151:46.89]What barrel?
[151:47.75]Do you guys see a barrel?
[151:48.73]Oh.
[151:49.63]Lower than the barrel.
[151:53.13]Just do all the ones that are lower than the barrel.
[151:55.81]Got it.
[152:09.83]Nice work.
[152:12.25]Next one.
[152:20.29]Big core, broken wall, deep shadow.
[152:25.87]Big core, broken wall, deep shadow.
[152:48.34]Are you kidding me?
[152:49.86]Deep shadow, big core.
[152:51.90]Where's the help?
[153:03.32]I don't know.
[153:05.06]Up here.
[153:08.72]Center, close, center.
[153:14.86]It'd be funny if he was like, I have no idea.
[153:22.04]Good luck.
[153:26.64]Nothing.
[153:30.37]Okay.
[153:32.47]I can climb this, can't I?
[153:34.71]It has the yellow paint on it.
[153:39.97]You did it.
[153:43.09]Thank you.
[153:49.99]I couldn't have done it without your two ammo packs and two heals.
[153:56.17]A pony.
[153:56.75]I'll take it.
[154:18.36]You need to save the game, man.
[154:19.64]I know.
[154:22.34]When I get to one, you bet your ass I'm going to go.
[154:30.84]Oops.
[154:34.74]What's in here?
[154:35.30]Did I just say, what's in here?
[154:38.32]This is the room I was just in.
[154:43.16]What's in here?
[154:44.08]Okay.
[154:45.85]The room I just came from.
[155:00.57]There's still stuff down here.
[155:01.65]I don't really want to miss it.
[155:03.98]Alright, scrap.
[155:04.66]Is that it?
[155:04.98]Okay, cool.
[155:07.10]I like how it tells you when you're done.
[155:08.18]I'm going to take this.
[155:18.11]And I've got full ammo.
[155:19.21]I'm ready to get out of here.
[155:21.37]Put the last mask on and see what happens.
[155:23.67]Alright, there's something in here, too.
[155:47.72]Ah, this is that door that I couldn't open before.
[155:49.81]All right.
[155:53.37]They're giving me a lot of shotgun ammo.
[155:54.73]I feel like I'm going to get to a pretty intense part of the game.
[156:00.45]It looks like that's the case.
[156:01.79]So let's go ahead and do this now so I don't do it later.
[156:04.78]Okay, I've got three heals, 13 shotgun bullets, and I'm going to hold on to this.
[156:15.68]Who are you talking to?
[156:18.22]My friend Dave is here.
[156:19.24]I've been playing it for him.
[156:21.88]Yeah, what's up, man?
[156:23.28]So I got three heals.
[156:24.98]I have 13 shotgun bullets.
[156:26.98]Yeah, I'll go back to the other room.
[156:30.52]Just to make sure you know.
[156:31.31]I mean, who am I talking to?
[156:33.39]Okay, this is clear.
[156:37.47]I'm going to get spawned on in here, aren't I?
[156:49.20]Alright.
[156:52.16]I'm gonna save it and I'm gonna go to the salon.
[156:54.80]There's something in there I didn't get.
[157:05.65]Almost time.
[157:11.81]Almost time.
[157:12.51]Whatever that is.
[157:21.68]That's the clock guy from Beauty and the Beast.
[157:23.55]I feel like this is bullshit.
[157:29.87]I know.
[157:44.47]And this person's, like, helping me and whoever this person is is helping me and coaching me because they want my power.
[157:50.31]Because it's going to be taken from me and it's going to be in this little crystal.
[157:53.56]And the person that's coaching me is the one that's going to benefit from this.
[157:57.06]Right?
[158:01.50]That's at least I feel like it's happening.
[158:02.68]Okay.
[158:06.79]Okay.
[158:11.05]Um, before I place that, I do want to go straight and left.
[158:14.85]I'm going to go to the salon.
[158:15.57]It looks like I can open the door now.
[158:16.85]I feel like there's something in there.
[158:27.93]Oh, there's that briefcase in here.
[158:30.15]Oh, right.
[158:30.99]Okay, let's open it.
[158:31.83]What do we got?
[158:36.85]Compensator.
[158:44.84]What does this do?
[158:48.46]Lemmy.
[158:50.78]Compensator?
[158:58.41]Increased power.
[158:59.25]Okay, so just make the pistols better now.
[159:01.03]Okay.
[159:02.09]That's helpful.
[159:07.00]Compensator.
[159:18.69]Save it again.
[159:19.11]Wait, why are you compensating?
[159:24.60]I'm not.
[159:29.94]Alright, moment of truth.
[159:31.14]What's going on?
[159:31.78]What happens here?
[159:32.24]Let's find out.
[159:50.93]There it is.
[160:00.52]Well done, little one.
[160:03.50]You've more than earned this reward.
[160:07.87]Almost looks like the real thing, doesn't it?
[160:12.92]What?!
[160:15.86]It's a replica, of course.
[160:17.92]Nothing that valuable could ever manifest on this stratum.
[160:25.05]Did you really think I'd give away something so precious?
[160:30.88]I had to bait the trap with something.
[160:34.80]No!
[160:35.74]No!
[160:44.88]They missed an opportunity for him to go while he was laughing, like a huge internal acid burp.
[160:54.20]They missed the opportunity.
[160:57.77]Now comes the real fun.
[161:00.43]The perfect place for your demise.
[161:05.15]Let the show begin!
[161:07.07]What?
[161:08.05]You're kidding!
[161:08.77]I have to find him?
[161:11.62]Sure thing!
[161:13.78]I forgot how to fucking play the game.
[161:15.10]What happened?
[161:17.58]Oh shit!
[161:19.86]This is uglier now!
[161:54.30]We are.
[161:54.82]Tonight's entertainment.
[162:05.19]Holy shit.
[162:05.97]I got to run.

[165:15.44]Hurry up.
[165:15.70]What's over here?
[165:16.14]Get it.
[165:21.70]He's on his back.
[165:35.08]Okay, here we go.
[165:35.52]Ready?
[165:35.70]Get three.
[165:51.66]No, don't disappear.
[165:52.62]One.
[166:03.19]Two.
[166:09.05]Enough with the dilly-dally.
[166:11.11]Finish this!
[166:30.04]I can do that too.
[166:32.90]Useless creature!
[166:35.22]Such a disappointment!
[166:42.13]No matter.
[166:44.79]Your imminent demise is inevitable.
[166:59.35]Run.
[167:00.85]Run.
[167:03.19]Where?
[167:04.91]Here.
[167:15.95]Come.
[167:46.31]Now what?
[167:49.68]Where am I now?
[167:50.58]He just did the same improv filter you did.
[167:57.74]You see, the thing about that is your imminent demise is inevitable.
[168:03.58]I don't want to leave.
[168:09.94]until I find that crystal that's funny I'm tired of being a freak I wanna have friends I want to live a normal life without this curse if that purifying crystal can make that happen make me normal then I'm not going back until I find it okay stubborn yeah so
[168:37.42]It's Ethan.
[168:39.20]It's Ethan.
[168:43.66]Okay.
[168:53.89]Explore your surroundings.
[168:55.11]We're here in a deeper dream world, it seems.
[168:58.29]I need to... I have to move this stuff around here.
[169:05.75]How do I move shit?
[169:06.79]Okay, like this.
[169:16.02]Oh, it's F. Okay.
[169:34.39]I don't like this set.
[169:35.65]Can it be, like, right-click?
[169:42.19]Because it's shift to pick it up, and then left-click to do, and then F to put it down.
[169:47.98]I can't...
[170:03.29]Okay, that's good.
[170:04.19]Alright, that looks okay.
[170:11.59]Well, I have to tell you, very importantly, you are imminent demise.
[170:16.34]That's my favorite.
[170:17.14]So let's get searching.
[170:21.74]There are subtitles for the handwriting.
[170:24.86]There are?
[170:28.16]I know where the crystal is.
[170:29.50]What's this?
[170:37.45]Everything's loaded, right?
[170:38.29]Oh, let's get the shotgun shells.
[170:40.34]Do I have any?
[170:40.82]Can I make anything?
[170:44.44]I cannot.
[170:44.72]I don't want to make any more handgun bullets.
[170:45.92]I have plenty.
[171:10.75]Will you be my friend?
[171:15.57]Nah, sorry.
[171:19.51]Nah.
[171:34.15]Let's play.
[171:37.92]I swear I've seen these monkeys before, but what the hell?
[171:43.25]Let's play.
[171:43.85]Isn't this where the doll was in the base game?
[171:53.01]Is the doll still alive?
[172:19.22]So we're going down?
[172:20.92]Up?
[172:23.48]What's wrong?
[172:28.57]Did I... Oh.
[172:29.47]Okay.
[172:30.17]What does it say?
[172:30.85]What does it say?
[172:31.21]What does it say?
[172:31.79]I... Put it in front of me.
[172:33.25]Why are you writing it behind... Something seems different.
[172:43.24]Okay.
[172:43.98]This is weird.
[172:52.25]This is weird.
[172:52.85]Looks like a breaker box for the elevator, but it's not.
[172:56.92]Wait, is this where the big baby thing is?
[172:59.44]I hated this.
[173:04.28]I hated this from the base game.
[173:09.36]Oh, God.
[173:09.98]Don't tell me it's going to do the baby noise and the baby thing.
[173:15.17]Hope not.
[173:16.85]Today is my first day of school.
[173:18.23]I've always wanted to go.
[173:19.47]I'm going to give Chris a big hug next time I see him.
[173:23.05]There were so many kids my age, it was like I walked into a TV show or something.
[173:26.57]I was so scared when I had to introduce myself to the class, but I was still super-duper excited to be there.
[173:30.23]I'm going to make so many friends.
[173:32.47]I'm going to try and talk to them tomorrow.
[173:35.09]Okay.
[173:35.87]See you two later.
[173:37.19]I try to be brave and talk to some of the other kids, but no one wants to talk to me.
[173:40.77]Schoolwork is super easy.
[173:42.13]It's all stuff I learned with mommy.
[173:44.15]But I guess I shouldn't answer all the teachers' questions.
[173:46.55]The boy behind me said something really mean.
[173:48.71]My hands go icky with white sweat when I panic.
[173:51.16]It was really bad today.
[173:53.64]Today the teacher yelled at me for always carrying my hanky.
[173:56.61]She says I'm not a baby anymore.
[173:58.91]The boys at school keep saying how I'm icky, but I take a bath every night, always wear clean clothes, and bring a fresh hanky every day.
[174:06.17]It's because of the stupid white sweat.
[174:08.45]Whenever it starts coming out of my hands, I wipe it off right away, but sometimes it won't wipe off, so I just hold my hanky really tight.
[174:14.68]Chris even told the teacher it can't get anyone sick, but it didn't change anything.
[174:19.21]Someone finally talked to me.
[174:20.29]Wait, this is like, this is a month later.
[174:23.83]Someone finally talked to me.
[174:24.93]Lucy from my class said she always wanted to be friends.
[174:27.89]We're going to have lunch together tomorrow.
[174:30.26]I can't believe it.
[174:30.84]I'm so happy.
[174:31.44]I hope Lucy's friend Catherine will be my friend too.
[174:35.02]This is...
[174:56.85]Okay.
[174:58.55]It's, uh, locked.
[175:00.06]There's a crest on here.
[175:09.44]I tensed up so bad, I put my feet on the legs of my chair.
[175:13.31]Hmm.
[175:30.13]I hate big doors that are right in center frame.
[175:32.94]Okay.
[175:57.49]I'm checking all this first.
[176:01.58]Why is it... There's nothing even in here.
[176:03.00]Why would there be nothing in there?
[176:04.24]Okay, well, let's see what happens.
[176:07.84]The crystal's right there, but there's no way to get it.
[176:19.43]Lights off.
[176:20.07]Turn your lights off.
[176:20.77]Turn your lights off.
[176:22.99]It's time.
[176:24.11]I'll turn my lights off.
[176:36.12]Let's see how it looks.
[176:43.59]Like, no change.
[176:44.35]Am I still 60 FPS?
[176:48.35]Alright, hold on, I can... Okay.
[176:49.93]Okay.
[177:11.57]Better?
[177:11.79]Is it better?
[177:24.89]I'll turn this back to where it was.
[177:29.75]Okay.
[177:29.85]Why am I so shiny?
[177:37.62]Am I in 60 FPS here?
[177:43.66]Okay.
[177:44.70]That looks fine.
[177:46.46]Lights off.
[177:47.10]We're good.
[177:48.21]Scary time.
[177:48.67]I have like a wax face, but I promise you it's just because the light's bright here.
[177:57.89]Wipe my T-zone.
[178:06.57]Okay.
[178:07.45]I'm ready.
[178:08.79]Okay.
[178:14.97]The stomach has been stitched up.
[178:16.16]It looks like there's something inside.
[178:17.42]Ugh.
[178:46.15]Move our items.
[178:46.61]I don't even have any items, but... Whatever.
[178:53.02]Shit all over the walls.
[179:18.00]What was that?
[179:20.18]Okay.
[179:47.55]Okay.
[179:49.68]I need a pair of scissors.
[180:00.77]Okay, it's O2.
[180:03.85]O2 what?
[180:07.74]O2...
[180:17.43]Okay, 4-4.
[180:19.81]4-4-0-2.
[180:20.29]Uh... I'm in the trash.
[180:31.62]No.
[180:32.32]4-4-0-2.
[180:37.96]Rusted shut.
[180:38.61]4-4-0-2.
[180:42.27]There's one more number.
[180:43.23]Where is it?
[180:55.51]Not on here, right?
[180:59.44]The stuffed locker.
[181:00.62]The picture on the bookshelf.
[181:01.98]The desk covered in stuff.
[181:07.54]There's a desk with stuff on it, right?
[181:33.80]It's not in here, is it?
[181:52.76]Go back.
[181:53.08]I thought it would be in the room I was just in.
[182:02.11]Stop with that loud sound.
[182:03.73]Go to the corner desk.
[182:16.59]This has a lot of stuff on it.
[182:28.72]Oh, okay. 66.
[182:33.91]Oh, two or 44.
[182:36.23]I mean, I guess whatever.
[182:39.81]Oh, two six.
[182:41.17]What is it?
[183:01.81]Scissors.
[183:02.59]All right.
[183:07.45]That's not even... It's a fucking sound effect.
[183:16.17]Back out here.
[183:27.02]What the hell?
[183:47.57]Excuse me.
[183:47.99]Thank you.
[183:52.61]What was in here?
[183:53.13]A key?
[183:56.38]Oh, it's the crest.
[183:59.96]Is it gonna be a big one of these running around?
[184:16.87]Lucy.
[184:17.45]Uh, Lucy?
[184:17.81]I don't know.
[184:48.99]Maybe you'll get the crystal once you get the campfire started.
[185:07.07]Doll?
[185:07.43]Okay, that's Lucy.
[185:08.63]I bet you can find all kinds of places to play with this doll.
[185:13.05]Okay.
[185:14.57]Okay.
[185:24.45]Nothing.
[185:28.11]Anything in here?
[185:30.82]Nothing.
[185:31.02]Alright, well Lucy probably goes on with Lucy, right?
[185:34.96]Okay.
[185:43.13]Alright, so I'm going to put you here.
[185:46.77]What's this shit on the other side say?
[185:53.01]Label is completely illegible.
[185:57.73]Illegible.
[185:58.19]Okay.
[186:01.59]I need three more dolls.
[186:02.71]I guess we're going to go over here.
[186:15.44]Jimmy's room.
[186:16.08]Okay.
[186:22.52]Can't go in here.
[186:27.06]Okay, so I can't use that.
[186:33.43]So... This way.
[186:36.31]Okay.
[186:52.95]Put that in here.
[187:02.24]I look so greasy.
[187:23.17]Okay, here we go.
[187:24.95]Joel.
[187:33.97]Okay.
[187:40.23]I think I need Lucy.
[187:44.40]I think, yeah, I need Lucy for this.
[187:48.42]I need Lucy.
[187:49.40]Fine.
[187:50.06]I'll go get it.
[188:11.90]Okay.
[188:12.82]Got Lucy.
[188:19.07]Sprint punch this head off.
[188:21.23]Sprint punch the head off.
[188:22.33]That's what I would do.
[188:22.89]Okay.
[188:33.21]So, Lucy is definitely up here.
[188:38.55]Right?
[188:38.79]Because Lucy is...
[188:41.67]Holding this?
[188:42.83]Yeah.
[188:44.23]And then... Somebody's pointing at this.
[188:48.81]So you're pointing over there.
[188:52.21]And then what goes here?
[188:53.41]There's another doll that I didn't get.
[188:57.32]A shelf somewhere?
[189:18.94]Close, please.
[189:20.24]Close.
[189:24.54]Close the door.
[189:25.20]Okay.
[189:39.86]The doll.
[189:43.62]Is there a doll?
[189:44.22]Is this a rusted shot?
[189:46.54]No.
[189:47.02]I'll save it, though.
[189:53.02]Hmm.
[190:00.72]Okay.
[190:07.40]I'm missing a doll.
[190:08.58]No?
[190:22.67]Stop.
[190:23.07]I knew you were there.
[190:33.24]This doll?
[190:33.92]Can I pick up this doll?
[190:35.28]No.
[190:35.90]It's three dolls.
[190:36.66]It might be four.
[190:39.59]Where the fuck is this other doll?
[190:54.76]So you want me to play with dolls?
[190:57.48]Oh.
[190:59.96]Oh, god damn it.
[191:01.32]Okay.
[191:01.76]Alright, so I have... I gotta go get the other two.
[191:08.94]Okay, so you're cleaning and you're pointing.
[191:10.82]Alright.
[191:14.50]You're cleaning, you're pointing, and that's what I have to do.
[191:16.62]So I have to go back and get those.
[191:17.98]Is those chem?
[191:21.71]Uh-huh.
[191:35.32]pod watchers you can skip.
[191:36.66]Oh, no.

[191:38.82]I got the dolls.
[191:39.38]I'm ready.
[191:40.68]I'm good.
[191:53.03]Okay.
[191:55.12]You should skip 30 seconds.
[191:56.34]If you skip 30 seconds, then you're going to miss me completing this part of the puzzle right now.
[192:00.24]You don't want to do that.
[192:01.08]Why would you skip right now?
[192:01.86]Look.
[192:02.50]Look.
[192:11.37]OK.
[192:11.45]Yeah, yeah, I get it.

[192:21.73]Key.
[192:23.79]OK, I got the key to Jimmy's room.
[192:25.39]I'm going to pick these back up.
[192:29.01]All right.
[192:32.59]Fuck you.
[192:35.27]Let's go to Jimmy's room.
[192:39.12]All right, I think this is like kind of freaking me out because something's gonna be here, right?
[192:43.37]You don't get the key and then have the mannequin not be standing right here when I turn the corner.
[192:46.33]Oh god.
[193:15.85]Hi.
[193:17.21]Hi.
[193:51.78]Not funny.
[193:55.32]Fucking dork.
[194:12.50]Okay, there's the doll.
[194:13.70]God, this is so creepy.
[194:17.32]Just a well.
[194:20.84]Alright, I got all three.
[194:21.66]Now I gotta go in the... Alright, something fucked up is gonna happen right here.
[194:25.22]Alright.
[194:27.78]Let me do some stretches, because I'm gonna go like... And it's gonna hurt.
[194:30.96]It's gonna give me acid reflux, I know it.
[194:38.67]Okay, so the other room... I gotta go out here...
[194:43.62]And kind of through the hall.
[194:44.96]I knew it.
[194:45.64]I told you this was going to happen.
[194:50.44]Just pick her up and just drop her down the well.
[195:00.16]No, you know what?
[195:02.34]No, fuck that.
[195:04.00]Pick her up and just bring her with you.
[195:07.24]Just hold her like under your arm.
[195:09.06]Right?
[195:09.98]Just carry this around.
[195:13.47]Right?
[195:14.19]It can't appear in front of me and get me and scare me.
[195:16.65]What if I just pick it up and walk around with it?
[195:38.15]Okay.
[195:38.67]I need three... I need four dolls here.
[195:44.74]I'll probably get the next one by... It's, um... In the storage room.
[195:53.47]Okay.
[195:56.95]I need to save the game.
[195:58.01]Was there a save point?
[195:58.73]It's right here somewhere?
[195:59.99]Where's the save point?
[196:00.71]Shit, it's far away.
[196:02.83]Okay.
[196:03.57]Here we go.
[196:04.21]One, two, three.
[196:05.09]Everybody close your eyes.
[196:22.97]Okay.
[196:24.99]Okay.
[196:26.70]Alright.
[196:27.74]Now, you are holding this.
[196:35.58]You are catching the present.
[196:39.53]And you are pointing.
[196:47.05]And that does... What?
[196:53.93]Alright, I got all the dolls.
[196:55.13]Okay.
[197:02.62]It's time.
[197:03.12]Uh, I need to save the game.
[197:08.76]Alright, so if I go out here, I need to bang a left.
[197:21.19]This is left.
[197:21.89]Left.
[197:24.11]Whatever.
[197:29.77]Oh my god.
[197:30.55]It better not be the baby.
[197:55.37]Alright, thank god it's saved.
[198:09.65]It's gonna break through the... I knew it!
[198:13.15]I said what I'd fucking tell you!
[198:14.61]Carry it with you under your arm like a fucking football!
[198:16.83]God damn it, I knew it!
[198:29.31]Okay, here we go.
[198:30.13]You are doing this.
[198:35.09]You are... I don't know, holding something?
[198:41.93]Holding that, maybe?
[198:43.07]Yeah.
[198:45.69]You're pointing.
[198:46.35]Is there a safe point in here?
[198:51.25]No.
[198:51.45]Alright, well, I don't know.
[198:52.71]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[198:55.86]You're... Hold on.
[199:01.53]Look, I think you're holding sticks.
[199:04.25]And then you're over there.
[199:05.61]Alright, here we go.
[199:08.31]And this is the breaker box key.
[199:24.56]Aw, she's dead.
[199:31.37]So sad.
[199:37.83]Fuck you.
[199:39.60]Actually, fuck off with this.
[199:42.18]Who is it?
[199:42.84]Hello?
[199:43.28]Hello, hello?
[199:44.62]Jeez, bros, you're still looking for the crystal?
[199:50.28]Fine, I'll help you out.
[199:52.75]Just take the elevator to me.
[199:56.23]Mommy might be upset that I'm helping you, though.
[200:05.12]Probably me from the past or something.
[200:08.42]Something just opened the door.
[200:11.61]Something just opened the door.
[200:12.37]Alright, where's the elevator?
[200:13.01]Where is it?
[200:13.39]Straight?
[200:14.53]Okay, straight, right, left, right.
[200:26.79]Fuck.
[200:42.65]It's game over if they catch you.
[200:44.09]Yeah, yep.
[200:47.59]Where's the save point?
[200:48.49]Give me it before I turn this on.
[200:52.00]Don't look away.
[200:53.30]What?
[200:53.92]Oh, not one of these.
[200:57.16]Don't look away.
[201:07.66]I gotta find the fuses!
[201:09.06]Where are the fuses?
[201:11.56]Don't look away, don't look away.
[201:12.46]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[201:13.34]Where is it?
[201:13.62]I need to find a fuse.
[201:24.57]See, if I had just carried you around, I could just hold you in front of me like this, have you facing this way, and just stare at you while I use my peripheral to do the mission.
[201:33.27]You know what I'm saying?
[201:37.40]Does this count?
[201:38.06]Okay.
[201:39.06]Get the fuse.
[201:49.87]Okay.
[201:50.25]I have to get to the study and then it's in the room past the study.
[202:01.67]What?
[202:07.93]This door is right here, right?
[202:08.89]Oh my fucking god.
[202:12.15]Okay, this is fucked up.
[202:13.13]This is fucked.
[202:13.87]I hate this shit.
[202:14.65]I hate this.
[202:15.35]I hate it more than anything.
[202:16.31]I really hate this kind of shit.
[202:18.56]Why can't I just play Picross?
[202:19.56]I'm concerned about me looking the other way.
[202:26.04]Like, I want to play Picross.
[202:29.72]I don't know what's behind me.
[202:30.60]I need to use the map.
[202:31.49]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[202:34.15]Which way do I need to go?
[202:34.89]Okay, I'm going to back up this way.
[202:41.34]There's only one... Okay, I thought there were two.
[202:42.72]Okay.
[202:50.81]Turn this way?
[202:51.91]Is this correct?
[202:55.55]And back up like this?
[202:58.55]Oh!
[203:04.03]I thought it was gonna come behind me.
[203:06.61]Okay.
[203:08.86]Medicine room?
[203:15.94]I thought it was coming behind me.
[203:24.76]Does it have pathing?
[203:26.27]What kind of pathing does it take?
[203:27.41]Okay, in here?
[203:32.31]What?
[203:34.55]What do you mean it's locked from the other side?
[203:39.77]I'm in a corner.
[203:42.11]What does the stupid map say?
[203:44.88]Where's the kitchen?
[203:52.82]That, the game, fuck you game, you just tried to get me, because that was coming from my left side, you just tried to get me to look this way in the game.
[204:00.58]Nice try.
[204:02.20]I, nice try, really.
[204:14.50]Okay, now, what did I just open?
[204:19.68]Okay, I'm in a new, I'm in a new room?
[204:22.37]I'm in a new room.
[204:25.85]If the door closes, what happens?
[204:45.88]Uh...
[204:55.26]Okay, okay.
[205:03.13]Oh.
[205:03.97]Uh-oh.
[205:17.32]Am I still looking in the right direction here?
[205:20.48]Technically?
[205:20.94]I think this is technically looking in the right direction.
[205:36.29]Is there any items?
[205:49.39]Oh my god!
[205:50.17]It's fine.
[206:07.36]Okay, what do I do?
[206:08.54]I have a minute.
[206:08.98]I have a second or two.
[206:12.19]Oh, fuck.
[206:15.07]Jesus Christ.
[206:20.32]You are doing the I'm walking around behind somebody that's taking a picture at an amusement park.
[206:27.01]And you make direct eye contact with the lens of the camera.
[206:30.29]I know we've talked about this a few times before, but I always think about this.
[206:33.13]Me and Holly were at Disneyland recently, right?
[206:34.95]We went with Ludwig and Cutie hanging out.
[206:37.61]And I thought of this again.
[206:40.60]How many pictures are you in where you are just walking by completely in frame in somebody else's picture just like this?
[206:51.82]It's probably, do you think it's more than 5,000?
[206:57.26]Do you think it's more than 5,000?
[207:00.24]How many pictures are you in where you're doing that?
[207:02.87]You're doing this.
[207:09.33]Okay.
[207:10.11]I have the fuse.
[207:11.75]I just have to get the hell out of here.
[207:20.28]I think I just have to walk by.
[207:23.40]Is there anything in the wardrobe?
[207:25.49]I don't know.
[207:26.03]Who cares?
[207:26.43]Don't look.
[207:27.31]It's going to be like a chemical packet.
[207:30.11]How do I go by?
[207:30.81]What if I touch her?
[207:43.82]Oh, man.
[207:44.50]That sucks.
[207:45.28]Okay.
[207:45.38]Okay.
[207:51.60]Uh-huh.
[207:52.40]Uh-huh.
[207:52.90]Okay.
[207:54.46]And then... I can back up all the way here, right?
[207:58.66]Should I go... Do you grab people?
[208:03.08]What's happening?
[208:05.16]Are there two?
[208:05.92]Are there actually two now?
[208:06.82]I can't move.
[208:09.46]What do I do?
[208:10.32]Are there actually two?
[208:11.20]Oh, shit.
[208:19.46]Oh, my God.
[208:20.48]Okay.
[208:23.64]Please tell me it's not two.
[208:24.60]That would be so awful.
[208:35.50]Huh?
[208:36.02]Huh?
[208:36.66]Huh?
[208:37.14]Huh?
[208:37.68]Huh?
[208:38.20]Huh?
[208:38.76]This too.
[208:39.42]This too.
[208:40.04]This too.
[208:40.58]This too.
[208:41.04]This too.
[208:41.68]This too.
[208:43.04]This too.
[208:43.70]Oh, what the f- Who made this game?
[208:48.10]You're a fucking maniac.
[208:56.12]Oh my god!
[208:56.92]Okay, I have to... Oh my god!
[209:02.98]Stop moving, you fuckers!
[209:07.02]Help me, help me, help me, help me!
[209:09.52]Help, help, help, help, help!
[209:12.48]Where's the other one going?
[209:13.62]Where's the other one going?
[209:17.08]I have to start over.
[209:17.70]I have to start over.
[209:27.05]Oh my god, I'm sprinting.
[209:32.57]Dude, give me a chance!
[209:34.93]Okay, no, thank god.
[209:35.88]Alright, alright, alright.
[209:36.60]I'm just gonna sprint.
[209:37.56]I'm sprinting now.
[209:38.24]Oh, fuck.
[209:44.80]Okay.
[209:45.60]Oh, this hurts now because I know this too.
[209:50.10]Oh, this sucks.
[209:51.42]I think I'm just gonna run.
[209:53.56]Dude, I don't know.
[209:54.28]How do I stop the other one from coming at me too?
[209:59.11]I think I did it.
[210:01.29]Shut up.
[210:02.33]Shut up.
[210:06.75]What's the fastest way I can get out of here?
[210:14.23]I'm thinking just back.
[210:15.37]You've got to keep them both right here.
[210:17.87]I think just go backwards.
[210:19.29]Straight back.
[210:19.86]Keep them in frame.
[210:23.81]And then I'm gonna go left.
[210:29.61]That's fine.
[210:29.97]That's fine.
[210:30.29]That's fine.
[210:30.65]That's fine.
[210:31.03]That's okay.
[210:31.47]That's fine.
[210:31.85]That's fine.
[210:32.25]Both of you.
[210:32.61]If there's a third one, I'm gonna shit my pants on camera.
[210:50.25]Okay, so now I gotta go...
[210:57.65]If I go... It's okay.
[211:09.47]They're all going to come right here.
[211:11.04]One, two, three.
[211:12.14]There you are.
[211:12.98]Okay, we're fine here.
[211:14.30]Oh, you know what?
[211:17.18]I would have been in a lot of trouble if I didn't... Which way do I have to go?
[211:24.76]This way, right?
[211:25.96]Which way do I have to go?
[211:31.57]Oh my god!
[211:32.41]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[211:33.89]How come there's not three?
[211:37.91]Why is there not three?
[211:39.79]Why is there not three?
[211:41.07]There's only one.
[211:44.88]Why is there only... Excuse me?
[211:47.74]Excuse me!
[211:49.26]Excuse me!
[211:51.02]Excuse me!
[211:52.12]Excuse me!
[211:52.64]There's a fourth one!
[212:03.96]Holy shit, this sucks.
[212:06.52]Okay, I'm sweating.
[212:08.34]This is actually horrible.
[212:09.78]This is actually terrifying.
[212:12.84]I think I'm just gonna go for it.
[212:14.34]And you know what?
[212:15.04]Fuck it, right?
[212:15.72]Like, I'm just gonna run straight.
[212:18.07]I'm running straight.
[212:18.89]I'm just gonna run.
[212:19.53]This is so bad.
[212:21.87]This is so bad.
[212:23.59]Okay, how fast are you?
[212:25.87]Like, I give a shit.
[212:26.63]Just try it and run.
[212:32.36]Where's the other one?
[212:32.82]There's a third one.
[212:42.81]All the air is out of my body.
[212:43.85]Hold on.
[212:52.90]Now, when I turn my...
[213:05.24]There's one right here.
[213:06.90]I'm thinking... I don't know.
[213:10.12]I think I just run by.
[213:11.04]Hi, guys.
[213:22.95]Hi, everybody.
[213:28.45]Okay.
[213:29.05]I'm almost there.
[213:31.39]Okay.
[213:34.47]Now...
[213:44.19]It's easy to be good at the game.
[213:47.28]I made it.
[213:48.44]Now he's going to turn here.
[213:51.60]And... Ah!
[213:53.30]Ah!
[213:54.22]Ah!
[213:55.20]Ah!
[213:56.90]Put it in!
[214:00.55]Get in the elevator!
[214:04.65]What?
[214:04.81]It's not going.
[214:07.57]That sucked.
[214:08.85]That actually hurt my whole body.
[214:11.75]That hurt.
[214:12.49]That was painful.
[214:14.47]Where are you doing this?
[214:15.51]Oh my God.
[214:16.43]You're after the crystal, aren't you?
[214:18.87]Do you know where it is?
[214:20.05]I've gathered some friends just for you.
[214:24.47]No, no more of this.
[214:25.47]I don't want to do this.
[214:27.27]And maybe I'll tell.
[214:28.47]No more of this.
[214:31.05]Please.
[214:32.41]Give me my shotgun back.
[214:34.22]At least.
[214:35.70]Oh no.
[214:36.24]What is going on here?
[214:38.26]No, not at all.
[214:39.32]No, no, no.
[214:40.36]I'm so small.
[214:43.86]Poor little Rose.
[214:46.46]I'm waiting for you in the back bedroom.
[214:52.05]The pictures I'm seeing over here are like you fed a sour candy like a warhead to somebody.
[214:57.91]Holy shit, dude.
[215:01.21]What animal?
[215:01.77]This is a good animal.
[215:09.42]Okay, let's look.
[215:21.25]I don't know what this is, or what I look like, but it's very strange.
[215:36.24]Dude.
[215:37.34]Oh my god.
[215:38.38]I don't even look like a real person.
[215:40.24]I don't look like a real person.
[215:44.49]Okay.
[215:46.59]Okay.
[215:48.93]Stir used to say that I looked sometimes like this very specific Hearthstone card.
[215:58.49]And now I see it.
[216:00.31]What's the card?
[216:01.92]It's the weird, like, octopus-looking one from Battlegrounds.
[216:10.88]Yeah.
[216:11.60]It's like a 1-1, and it turns into other things in your hand.
[216:20.82]It's like a 1-1, and it turns into something.
[216:25.58]Shifter Zerus.
[216:27.42]Yeah, dude, this is literally that card.
[216:29.22]This is that card looking at you right here.
[216:37.61]Right?
[216:38.05]Isn't that weird?
[216:38.77]And I remember when he first said it, I was like, dude, what are you talking about?
[216:49.26]Can a mod put Shifter Zerus card art into the stream over here, please?
[216:59.44]Thank you.
[217:01.42]Mm-hmm.
[217:11.43]Okay.
[217:13.31]Give me one moment.
[217:19.91]Let's overlay this.
[217:54.07]A little bit more opacity, I think.
[218:26.55]That's fucked up.
[218:37.72]It's literally the same exact eyes.
[218:39.66]Yeah.
[218:43.02]Hold on.
[218:50.78]Holy shit!
[219:07.54]Holy shit.
[219:18.42]I can't look at this anymore.
[219:19.56]It's scary.
[219:27.00]Wow.
[219:28.10]They're actually the same fucking picture.
[219:30.46]Okay, well, let's go.
[219:43.70]Let's play hide and seek.

[227:48.01]Why did I do that?
[227:48.71]I don't know why I freaked out.
[227:49.57]I thought she was going to go like...
[227:55.78]We don't even get to see.
[227:56.64]I thought she was going to go like this.

[232:03.02]Okay, go.
[232:05.03]Okay, turn it off.
[232:12.02]Stunning.
[232:25.66]Walk, walk forward.
[232:27.02]Oh man, that sucked.
[232:36.50]That was rough.
[232:38.06]No one likes Rose.
[232:39.82]Because she's a freak.
[232:41.44]Hey!
[232:42.46]She has those creepy powers.
[232:45.13]Just like her dad.
[232:46.79]That's why she doesn't have any friends.
[232:48.91]Shut up!
[232:50.06]You know it's true.
[232:52.02]What is wrong with her?
[232:54.73]Oh God.
[232:57.17]Not more of this.
[232:58.67]Oh shit.
[233:26.07]Okay.

[233:41.16]Mm-hmm.
[233:42.58]Oh, my God.
[233:43.40]Mom, you're so fast.
[233:45.76]What?
[233:48.34]Doctor, look.
[233:54.83]Mom?
[233:55.23]Wait, isn't that supposed to be mom?
[234:00.14]Wait, that's not mom.
[234:01.64]I thought it was mom.
[234:04.94]I thought it was mom.
[234:06.64]I was like, oh, mom is coming.
[234:18.60]That didn't work.
[234:26.86]Didn't they say, like, oh, and watch out, mom is coming.
[234:30.36]Didn't they say that?
[234:33.99]Who is this person chasing after me?
[234:35.59]I gotta get out of here.
[234:39.89]So you're the girl without any friends.
[234:50.64]We won't complain with you.
[234:52.08]Leave me alone!
[234:59.89]Oh, you piece of... I'm dead.
[235:02.13]I'm dead.
[235:06.92]Why is this not activating?
[235:11.76]I'm dead.
[235:12.22]It took so long to do.
[235:14.80]That was stupid.
[235:15.56]That was dumb.
[235:19.30]I was zoomed in and it just stopped.
[235:24.42]My arm just fell down.
[235:28.13]Just go and then turn around.
[235:29.47]It's right there.
[235:30.07]Okay, let's go.
[235:30.55]You should be nice to your friend.
[235:57.88]Nope.
[235:58.84]I finally found you.
[236:04.08]Let's go.
[236:04.66]Okay.
[236:05.32]That was rough.
[236:22.81]I can't take much more of this.
[236:25.03]Why are they talking about my dad?
[236:26.53]I never even met him.
[236:28.11]Do you resent him?
[236:32.39]I don't know.
[236:32.83]It's Ethan.
[236:33.91]I don't know the first thing about him.
[236:35.59]It's dead.
[236:36.29]Here we go.
[236:37.35]I wish I did.
[236:38.03]There's going to be like three paragraphs that show up.
[236:40.55]He died protecting me.
[236:45.91]Sometimes I try to imagine what my life would have been like if he hadn't died.
[236:54.10]But he's taught me to ride a bike, helped me with my homework, read me a story every night.
[237:00.29]But he's been there for me.
[237:02.03]All right, now manifest a bike.
[237:04.13]Sometimes when I feel lost or afraid, I try to imagine what he might have said to me.
[237:14.12]Oh, it's made up.
[237:16.22]I have something you should see.
[237:17.36]Oh, I was trying to walk.
[237:26.74]Welcome to the family.
[237:34.49]You're safe here.
[237:35.15]It feels familiar.
[237:41.33]Like I've been here before.
[237:45.03]Look at all the decorations.

[238:50.19]I wonder if she'll be a musician.
[238:51.33]I wonder if dad played any instruments.
[238:56.35]Yeah, add a shitty filter.
[238:58.93]She's so little.
[239:01.21]Hard to believe one day she'll be old enough to share a bottle of wine with her old man.
[239:05.64]So dad was a wine drinker.
[239:17.98]Take your time look around okay Rose is such a picky eater.
[239:38.48]I couldn't do it all she ever wants is fruit puree I
[239:41.57]I guess I've always loved fruit.
[239:43.89]Fruit?
[239:44.47]Fruit?
[239:44.81]Fruit?
[239:45.23]I can't talk.
[239:46.21]Fruit.
[239:47.29]It's the fruit puree.
[239:48.50]It's the two.
[239:49.04]It's the U's.
[239:51.18]Fruit puree.
[239:52.52]Why can I not say?
[239:53.66]Take these out.
[239:55.70]Fruit puree.
[240:13.38]Cool.
[240:29.12]What do you want to show me?
[240:30.04]What are you trying to show me?
[240:32.50]What is it you're trying to show me?
[240:43.75]Oh, that's a don't look upstairs.
[240:45.37]I think I've heard this before.
[240:58.82]It's pretty.
[240:59.18]I was waiting for it.
[241:20.62]Okay.
[241:22.12]Nothing in here.
[241:22.64]This is... No, I'm not gonna say it.
[241:31.36]This is my bedroom?
[241:36.19]Oh, and of course.
[241:37.45]She's already growing out of these onesies?
[241:41.17]I can't believe I was ever this tiny.
[241:47.03]She's growing so fast.
[241:49.28]I can't believe you were a baby.
[241:50.40]I can't believe I was a baby at one point.
[242:05.31]Uh oh, computer.
[242:23.84]I wonder if she'll look like me when she grows up.
[242:27.72]I looked so happy.
[242:32.00]Oh, OK, picture of baby.
[242:34.62]On the back.
[242:36.44]Key.
[242:36.68]Alright, what's on the computer?
[242:41.89]February 2nd is Rose's half birthday, half a year in the blink of an eye.
[242:45.13]I wanted to capture this moment, these feelings, so I wrote something special.
[242:49.09]I may have gotten a bit sappy though.
[242:51.05]I'd feel embarrassed if anyone stumbles across it.
[242:53.33]So it's safe in the sideboard for now.
[242:55.05]The key is behind my favorite photo.
[242:56.47]Okay.
[243:06.50]He just typed that into notepad.
[243:11.76]I guess I don't.
[243:14.77]Why would you write that?
[243:15.53]Yeah, why would you write I guess, to keep a document of where it is?
[243:19.09]I don't know.
[243:23.76]Happy half-birthday, Rose.
[243:26.36]My gift to you is a promise.
[243:29.38]I'll always be there for you, no matter what.
[243:33.02]I'll be there every birthday to watch you blow out the candles on your cake.
[243:36.99]I'll be there to make you breakfast and walk you to school every day.
[243:40.65]I'll be there when you have a bad dream and sing to you until you fall back asleep.
[243:46.21]I'll hug you tight when you're troubled or worried and tell you that everything's gonna be alright.
[243:52.51]You are my precious Rose.
[243:55.83]Never forget that, Dad.
[243:58.66]That's sad.
[243:59.74]That's pretty sad.
[244:00.34]No one loves you.
[244:02.54]Hey!
[244:03.52]No!
[244:05.30]No!
[244:08.22]Michael!

[244:11.00]No!
[244:12.18]What is that?
[244:19.33]Guess what?
[244:19.73]That thing you're looking for?
[244:39.38]Isn't here.
[244:43.19]So you don't have the purifying crystal?
[244:50.94]Of course not.
[244:53.32]It's all over me.
[244:54.36]Oh.
[244:57.60]For that, you'll have to go deeper.
[245:01.57]Much deeper.
[245:04.11]Poor Rose.
[245:05.79]She can't trust anyone.
[245:08.25]Why are you doing this?
[245:12.71]No one loves you.
[245:17.31]No one will ca- Enough games.
[245:26.59]Now you'll drown.
[245:30.89]I need to get out of this house.
[245:32.31]I came first.
[245:33.57]Michael?
[245:34.35]Where's Michael?
[245:35.23]First?
[245:39.03]I gotta make sure I fuel up.
[245:42.36]Why does she only want you?
[245:52.34]What?
[245:54.18]Go in the door.
[245:54.78]What's going on?
[245:56.64]Excuse me?

[246:40.09]Go back.
[246:44.07]Look at you.
[246:45.51]You are beyond worthless.
[246:50.18]Seriously, what is your problem?
[246:52.92]I mean, honestly.
[246:53.54]Well, it ain't this way.
[247:00.86]Ooh, okay.
[247:05.90]Alright, gimme, gimme, gimme.

[254:20.34]That's unlucky.
[254:25.10]That's so unlucky.
[254:27.36]It spawned underneath me.
[254:28.64]It spawned under my feet.
[254:32.42]Do not ask me to change the difficulty.
[254:34.33]How dare you?
[254:43.14]Never!
[254:44.13]Never!
[254:47.87]Watch out for her wind blasts!
[254:52.75]This way!
[254:53.37]I have been such a good girl!
[255:13.76]Whoa, that's bad.
[255:14.54]Watch your step.
[255:15.38]Yeah, you think so.
[255:20.10]What?
[255:53.45]This is stupid.
[255:57.63]This is stupid.
[256:02.77]Okay.
[256:05.45]You know, you're on like a five second stream delay, dad.
[256:10.03]Now I'm just annoyed.
[256:10.95]All right, whatever.
[256:11.59]Come on.
[256:16.38]I have been such a good girl!
[256:20.56]They're over here.
[256:26.05]When we died, we were supposed to be a family!
[256:36.43]But they're completely obsessed with stupid old roads!
[256:45.72]Okay, now just wait because now she spawns over here and does like a big omega bomb.
[256:59.65]Watch your step.
[257:00.43]Okay.
[257:02.63]Okay.
[257:03.97]What?
[257:14.89]Oh, shit.
[257:17.29]No, dude, I'm sick of this fucking goo shit.
[257:28.72]I'm sick of this.
[257:48.64]I'll do it again.
[257:59.03]No!
[258:09.25]What?
[258:09.81]You have me.
[258:11.73]Okay.
[258:18.42]Over here.
[258:19.64]You're nothing.
[258:21.48]Keep focusing.
[258:22.08]I'll help.
[258:22.48]No.
[258:25.27]Stop.
[258:27.39]All right.
[258:33.37]We're good.
[258:33.69]I can't believe how useless I am.
[258:41.68]No wonder no one loves me.
[258:45.50]What now?
[258:53.03]This is all your fault!
[259:00.85]And I will never let you have what you want!
[259:05.21]Rose, look out!
[259:06.73]Who's this guy?
[259:07.63]Who's that guy?
[259:10.79]Who is that guy?
[259:13.29]Don't give up, Rose.
[259:14.85]Find that crystal.
[259:21.08]Oh, it's Ethan, okay.
[259:37.38]It's Michael.
[259:38.70]No, isn't it Ethan, right?
[259:47.87]Michael?
[259:48.29]Are you there?
[259:51.29]It's Ethan from Resident Evil 8.
[259:55.59]Rose, look out!
[259:57.93]Michael Ethan?
[259:59.49]Ethan Michael?
[260:03.36]He saved me.
[260:06.24]But he didn't make it.
[260:10.44]That voice.
[260:11.10]My dad's voice.
[260:16.76]Is it Michael?
[260:19.62]My dad.
[260:21.56]Don't give up, Rose.
[260:23.12]Find that crystal.
[260:25.98]Wesker.
[260:26.38]I stole that from chat.
[260:28.49]Because of him.
[260:32.19]I can keep going.
[260:33.05]I have to find that crystal.
[260:40.17]This is Ethan.
[260:41.55]Yeah, it's Ethan.
[260:45.67]I'm on my own.
[260:49.26]But I have to keep going.
[260:50.64]Alright, where's the Duke?
[260:53.89]There's got to be an explanation as to why the Duke was doing that.
[260:55.87]The Duke was a good guy.
[260:56.69]Everybody loves the Duke.
[260:57.77]You're not going to make the Duke bad, evil.
[261:00.04]That's not cool.
[261:04.00]What's all this doing out here?
[261:17.95]Do I have my weapons back?
[261:18.93]Oh, I do.
[261:19.39]Okay.
[261:35.70]Actually, what the hell is going on here?
[261:38.90]Isn't this the thing we blew up in the 8th game?
[261:47.61]Chris is here and they detonate it, right?
[261:49.03]They drop the orbital strike on it.
[261:52.43]I thought Dad was gone.
[262:07.26]I thought I didn't have Dad anymore.
[262:10.66]Wait, that's not- that's me.
[262:11.82]Okay.
[262:12.42]Oops.
[262:28.61]That was a memory dream ghost.
[262:30.03]This game is fucked up.
[262:36.72]I might as well craft some items because I'm not going to have a chance, I think.
[262:39.52]Unless I can find an herb.
[262:48.44]I know it's been four and a half hours, but what's the heal button?
[262:59.20]Q, okay.
[263:02.17]It's not Q, is it?
[263:03.90]T?
[263:31.16]Thanks for the help.
[263:34.74]Oh, I can guard.
[263:37.72]It's okay.
[263:38.70]It's that button, right?
[263:40.52]That's what I made it.
[263:41.34]Okay.
[263:41.64]Okay.
[263:46.86]Is it now?
[263:56.29]A-listing check.
[263:57.13]Yep.
[264:01.85]coming from in here.
[264:45.99]That noise is so off-putting, it really is.
[264:48.03]Okay.
[265:03.74]We're good.
[265:12.04]I don't wanna use all my handgun ammo.
[265:16.04]What does that do?
[265:29.50]And I'll open.
[265:30.00]Okay.
[265:38.30]Down?
[265:38.62]How do I get- is there a safe way to get down?
[265:45.46]Okay.
[266:20.08]Cool.
[266:30.07]Wait, I have... I'm looking... Wait, I have... I got 1.2 billion views on TikTok?
[266:41.81]Is that a real number?
[266:45.70]Oh, excuse me?
[266:53.26]1.2 billion views on Jerma on TikTok.
[267:00.05]Huh?
[267:01.65]That's more than every channel I have combined.
[267:03.81]Like, times 10.
[267:07.01]What?
[267:08.27]Why am I not on that?
[267:09.59]Why am I not getting any of that?
[267:11.85]Why am I not getting any of that?
[267:12.99]What?
[267:20.82]Huh?
[267:21.32]Are you kidding me?
[267:26.04]Someone's been here.
[267:37.83]It was seen at some point during my experiments with consciousness an intruder made herself at home in my realm.
[267:48.32]This intruder was none other than the failure, Evelyn, who's been running about enacting her own pitiful agenda, which has led to a slight disruption in my own plans.
[267:57.63]Had Evelyn not interfered, Rosemary Winters would have been on the verge of despair.
[268:03.93]Dispossessed of her will to live and her, due to my side, powers.
[268:08.49]Instead, a new passion burns within her.
[268:11.21]I shall have to extinguish the duke talking.
[268:18.24]That was a lot of bullets.
[268:24.18]Oh yeah, it's final battle time.
[268:26.97]I had intended to duplicate Rosemary Winters with the hope that a perfect replica might serve as a suitable vessel.
[268:33.15]However, the results were less than ideal.
[268:35.99]It would seem that some sort of interference is preventing me from creating a suitable replica.
[268:41.09]Instead, I have succeeded in making what is essentially a living doll.
[268:44.84]It resembles the real thing, yes, but has no power.
[268:48.54]Such a pathetic huss could never prove suitable as a vessel.
[268:53.07]I will continue my efforts in hope of discerning the source of this interference.
[268:57.31]Several hypotheses have come to mind thus far.
[269:00.91]The fact that Rose herself is still alive.
[269:03.63]Some other actor within this realm.
[269:05.25]Me.
[269:07.45]A flaw in my methods of production.
[269:10.45]None of these seem especially likely to be the sole reason, nor any of them easy problems to solve.
[269:15.86]Perhaps my best hope is to somehow bring Rose into this realm.
[269:22.87]225 million views on another version of Jerma on TikTok?
[269:26.24]Do I have, like, 2 billion fucking views?
[269:35.34]What?
[269:37.58]How many views do I have on Twitch?
[269:40.35]I don't think I... 100 million?
[269:42.57]50 million, maybe?
[269:45.01]On YouTube, I have, like, 3, 400 million?
[269:47.87]A billion?! !
[269:57.50]I'm so confused right now.
[269:59.24]I'm shocked.
[270:01.52]Flexing?
[270:02.20]No, guys.
[270:02.56]These are not my accounts.
[270:04.72]These are not my accounts.
[270:05.68]I don't even flex.
[270:08.52]This is not a flex.
[270:13.19]Two billion.
[270:14.85]Don't look at my fucking armpits.
[270:18.07]Get on TikTok.
[270:18.99]I'm not getting on TikTok.
[270:19.95]I'm already there.
[270:20.47]I have two billion views.
[270:23.26]Okay.
[270:23.38]Okay.
[270:24.82]Further experiments with these Rose Copies, as I've taken to calling these husks, have yielded another interesting wrinkle to pursue.
[270:32.51]Somebody uploaded all of the dollhouse across, like, 200 parts.
[270:36.13]As, like... Alright.
[270:40.89]Okay.
[270:42.21]When subjected to situations evoking extreme terror, they actually begin to express some semblance of Rose's abilities.
[270:48.09]This warrants more research, and I think that by first creation, the Masked Duke is just the one to... Wait, hold on a minute.
[270:58.22]This warrants more research, and I think that my first creation, the Masked Duke, is just the one to perform the stress test.
[271:06.05]So this is not the real Duke.
[271:09.95]So this is not Duke.
[271:11.27]This is a Masked Duke.
[271:15.86]Okay.
[271:19.98]We already saw that.
[271:22.70]No, we didn't.
[271:23.36]Did we?
[271:28.66]Okay.
[271:41.87]Okay.
[271:46.58]Okay.
[271:48.54]Okay.
[271:49.22]Alright, I'm glad that that's not the real Duke.
[271:55.17]The Megamycete absorbs the memories of all life within its reach, but there are laws which govern this world within it.
[272:00.37]It seems worthwhile to catalog them as they become apparent.
[272:04.13]The memories that comprise this realm do not strictly reflect reality.
[272:09.81]Only those who are attuned to the Metamycete in life retain control of their faculties here in this realm.
[272:15.48]This aligns with my understanding of the Megamycete as revealed to me in its visions before my death.
[272:22.40]Yes, my death.
[272:24.24]My physical body is gone, absorbed into the megamycete.
[272:27.37]And yet I do not despair.
[272:29.27]This fate has granted me fascinating insights.
[272:31.44]All those years I strived have continued to strive.
[272:34.64]They're not for nothing.
[272:36.64]The memories, the consciousness, understanding, and knowledge I accumulated in life have transferred here to the Megami Seat, where it serves as a source of power within this realm.
[272:47.31]If I can harness this power, I believe I can use it to affect the thoughts and memories of others.
[272:53.43]Of course, it's hardly a perfect arrangement, with so many minds and memories gathered here, finding and retrieving a single person from amidst the rabble has proven an immense challenge.
[273:02.75]Her memories are here, yes, but dissolute.
[273:06.09]Perhaps what is needed is the right vessel into which to hold her.
[273:09.67]And of course, I know of the perfect vessel.
[273:12.31]The only real candidate in all my years of searching.
[273:15.78]Rosemary Winters.
[273:19.72]Is this the guy we saw on the bench in the beginning?
[273:21.36]Is this his project or something?
[273:31.91]I don't even know who that guy was.
[273:34.77]Okay, so... Cool.
[273:37.53]I guess we know what we're doing now.
[273:39.03]We're gonna pick up all this stuff.
[273:40.51]There's a lot of ammo.
[273:44.49]Let's take a quick look over here.
[273:50.06]Going deeper.
[273:51.74]You're losing viewers, dude.
[273:52.90]Do a joke.
[273:55.24]Oh, fuck.
[273:55.66]Alright.
[273:56.48]I'll do something wicked funny.
[274:09.81]That pole I've been feeling is close, but I just can't go any further.
[274:16.64]I thought I had made it when I saw that blue light, but no, not quite.
[274:19.58]If only I had been braver, faster, stronger, so close.
[274:22.16]I was so close.
[274:22.96]It's your birthday today.
[274:28.42]Cake and ice cream is on its way.
[274:41.61]How would you even know that?
[274:44.07]You actually would not know that.
[274:51.47]Okay, here we go.
[274:52.37]Here's the open book to the exact page presented on what happened in the story.
[275:00.29]Here we go.
[275:02.86]Black God, which lives in us and which we live, create for us a new world as befits your will.
[275:08.61]Your dark consciousness holds for us a second chance, graciously offered and joyously accepted.
[275:14.49]You drink the blood of the lost lamb as it falls upon your darkened earth, not to destroy but to preserve and once again deliver it onto life.
[275:25.62]What a twist.
[275:27.00]What a twist.
[275:33.26]I can't believe it was Cthulhu the whole time.
[275:38.03]God, I'm so sarcastic.
[275:43.19]Here it is!
[276:00.47]What do you think that smells like?
[276:02.35]I think it smells like paint.
[276:06.10]Like that smells like a fresh thing of paint.
[276:11.26]It probably smells like paint thinner or something.
[276:16.35]It's working.
[276:33.54]Uh-oh.
[276:41.96]Here it is.
[276:42.46]The person behind it all.
[276:45.16]Evelyn!
[276:49.66]Who's this again?
[276:51.47]Rose.
[276:52.61]Miranda.
[276:53.05]I've waited so long for you.
[276:56.41]Who... Who are you?
[277:00.09]My name is Miranda.
[277:06.14]Maybe she won't see it.
[277:07.06]If only I knew where the crystal was.
[277:11.36]I've been searching.
[277:11.92]I know you know where it is.
[277:13.15]Ah.
[277:13.23]Ah.
[277:32.46]An illusion!
[277:37.78]What are you hiding?
[277:39.39]We're just doing references from other movies and games.
[277:41.79]Rose!
[277:42.03]Run!
[277:55.97]Shit, he's not in frame.
[277:56.95]No.
[277:59.76]I wanted to get a picture of him.
[278:01.85]Oh, come on.
[278:25.01]Let's cut it off even more.
[278:26.23]Okay.
[278:46.84]Ugh.
[278:48.02]Wait, come on!
[278:48.78]It's a new pest!
[278:50.18]Go!
[278:52.70]Something he can manifest.
[278:56.13]Wait, what?
[279:03.24]Dude, don't waste your bullets on a fucking shitty enemy!
[279:08.72]That was a shotgun bullet, Dad!
[279:10.18]What are you, out of your mind?
[279:17.81]Stop using shotgun bullets on the default enemies!
[279:47.29]What?
[279:48.07]She should have just said, hey, it's me, Dad.
[279:55.96]Like, follow me, trust me, it's Dad.
[279:57.66]And, like, prove it by saying, like, what do you mean?
[280:03.50]I'm really sorry.
[280:05.00]I just needed to have a twist at the end of the game.
[280:07.15]I had to pretend to be somebody else, so your expectations could have been subverted for a minute.
[280:14.97]Dad, help!
[280:25.38]Fuck!
[280:27.66]I missed it.
[280:28.48]It's all right.
[280:35.53]I can't wait.
[280:35.91]We're gonna see Ethan's face.
[280:37.17]Yeah, you know, we don't ever see Ethan's face.
[280:41.55]She wouldn't have believed him.
[280:47.30]Why?
[280:48.94]They're grabbing me on the shoulder.
[280:51.20]Ethan, persistence is all we need.
[280:54.50]Rose, now's your chance.
[280:56.32]Go live a normal life.
[280:57.92]Make friends.
[280:59.12]No one will ever call you a freak again.
[281:02.24]That's not going to work.
[281:04.42]That was not going to work.
[281:05.64]Come on.
[281:06.08]It's Duke.
[281:30.18]Where's the Duke?
[281:30.84]I need the Duke.
[281:31.48]I think it was made out of fucking quartz.
[281:42.21]I don't care.
[281:42.91]That was a fake item.
[281:44.09]You're an idiot.
[281:44.59]You thought you were coming down here to get your powers?
[281:46.06]Alright, I'll stop fucking around.
[281:49.00]Don't worry, Dad.
[281:52.96]I've got this.
[281:55.11]You think your powers will allow you to stand against me in the heart of my domain?
[282:01.09]Foolish little... And T?
[282:03.33]A and T?
[282:03.78]How intent you were on my throwing them away?
[282:06.16]I think they just might.
[282:09.92]This is... Oh!
[282:14.77]How do I...?
[282:16.71]Meeeeee!
[282:17.63]Why do you fight?
[282:24.29]Oh!
[282:24.53]Pop!
[282:24.71]Absorb projectile.
[282:28.97]What?
[282:32.45]And then control.
[282:35.33]Let's go!
[282:54.29]See ya!
[282:54.79]Collect the projectile!
[283:27.26]Alright, here we go.
[283:30.43]You gonna do a thing?
[283:31.47]Oi!
[283:32.31]What?
[283:40.73]What are you doing?
[283:43.46]I didn't catch that.
[283:45.60]How did I not catch that?
[284:00.70]Little girl.
[284:02.60]It took so much to lure you.
[284:05.77]But you're incredible.
[284:07.75]What's going on?
[284:08.27]Reload, reload, reload.
[284:12.11]You might change your mind when I put an end to your plans.
[284:24.38]No!
[284:28.88]You bitch!
[284:31.39]I cultivated this world within the Megamycete to resurrect my sweet daughter.
[284:38.61]But no matter how many vessels I created, none had the power to regenerate her.
[284:43.81]Alright, here it comes.
[284:45.59]That is why it must be.
[284:49.00]You are the only one who can bring her back.
[284:52.58]Grab it!
[284:53.40]What are you talking about?
[284:54.76]I just grabbed it.
[284:55.52]Whatever I must do.
[284:57.34]I will chew this fruit.
[285:00.72]You're doing a lot of talking.
[285:06.67]How do you possess such power?
[285:10.99]Uh-oh.
[285:19.87]Your time.
[285:21.03]Oops.
[285:22.66]Time is at an end.
[285:26.95]Strike!
[285:30.33]Did I not hit?
[285:32.49]Oh my... I have no more... What happened to my powers?
[285:50.50]I don't have any more powers.
[285:52.97]Dude, holding... Okay, I would like a computer expert to tell me how to do this.
[285:57.85]How do you hold D with your index finger and press T to dodge?
[286:06.55]I need a computer expert.
[286:09.93]Dodging right, I need to hold D and then press T. D with thumb and then T with index?
[286:18.30]Excuse me?
[286:20.00]I'm changing that.
[286:23.41]I'm not using a controller.
[286:24.70]What's this T?
[286:52.06]It didn't even fucking work.
[287:09.83]It's T, man.
[287:10.85]I've been pressing T this whole time.
[287:20.11]I thought it was a double whatever I don't I thought it was a double Stop it
[287:58.87]This will all soon be.
[288:03.72]I forgot.
[288:04.36]It's all right.
[288:04.86]Fuck you.
[288:05.74]I have tons of heals.
[288:06.52]I have too many heals.
[288:07.20]I'm fine.
[288:16.41]Why do you fight?
[288:23.89]Help!
[288:30.79]Why suffer needles?
[288:35.19]Shut up!
[288:36.95]Let's see this power of yours.
[288:53.69]What did I do?
[288:54.77]I...
[288:58.08]I just fucking hate this fight.
[289:11.31]There's five hours and you introduce a dodge into the end sequence of the game.
[289:19.24]They introduce a dodge and parry mechanic into the final fight of the video game.
[289:32.00]There will be wailing and gnashing.
[289:38.97]How about this?
[289:42.77]Don't resist.
[289:46.09]Okay, do the thing again so I can...
[289:56.91]Alright, attack!
[289:58.88]There is nothing to fear.
[290:10.06]You are but a vessel!
[290:12.68]Do you still not see?
[290:14.78]There is no happy ending.
[290:18.32]Says the
[290:26.29]Uh-huh what is going on?
[290:31.23]Can you stop please
[290:50.65]You just won't give up.
[290:52.95]You really are.
[290:56.89]That stubborn knife that shines in life makes you the perfect vessel.
[291:07.08]Shoot something at me.
[291:09.18]You will fall.
[291:12.60]Just... There it is.
[291:18.62]How dare...
[291:21.48]Almost out of ammo.
[291:27.10]Oh!
[291:32.21]Got him all.
[291:33.97]Oops.
[291:34.31]Heal.
[291:46.84]Okay.
[291:50.38]Alright now do it do it do it do it!
[291:58.86]I hate this game.
[292:01.99]This game's a two.
[292:07.93]Offer yourself unto me!
[292:20.46]Little girl.
[292:22.41]I shall finish this.
[292:28.77]Oh, God damn it.
[292:30.49]There is no victory.
[292:34.65]My life, my struggle, comes to fruition.
[292:39.24]And how was I supposed to know what to do there?
[292:40.64]This game's a two.
[292:43.02]This game's a literal two.
[292:45.42]Rose!
[292:46.14]Over here!
[292:48.20]Dad!
[292:58.17]It's not a two.
[293:00.17]I'm just frustrated at how I can't dodge this shit.
[293:06.07]I hope we get to see his face, because that's the whole thing.
[293:07.85]It's like, ooh, you don't... Can't see Ethan's face.
[293:12.81]Please, come on.
[293:15.33]Zoom in right in his face.
[293:17.60]I love you, Rose.
[293:19.90]Come on!
[293:22.69]Return and yield your strength to me.
[293:31.60]Come here.
[293:35.02]So much power.
[293:37.52]You truly would have been the perfect vessel for my Eva.
[293:44.28]I'm not a goddamn vessel.
[293:45.76]I'm not some stupid copy.
[293:48.50]I'm me, Rose.
[293:51.47]And you're done.
[293:55.55]Okay, so we won.
[294:06.24]All right, Ethan, show the face.
[294:09.36]Imagine if he was like... Hey, it's pretty.
[294:20.45]My mouth is too slippery.
[294:24.45]And even though I wasn't there with you, I've always watched over you.
[294:31.33]I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you.
[294:35.81]He's just a guy.
[294:36.91]Face to face.
[295:05.99]No.
[295:08.29]I don't think they're gonna do it.
[295:29.41]They wanna do it so bad.
[295:32.06]You know they wanna do it so bad.
[295:33.46]Their arms are gonna come down.
[295:45.48]The arm directly in the way.
[295:50.76]Oh.
[295:51.84]Hey, they did stay true.
[295:53.00]They were like, we're not showing his face.
[295:56.83]They didn't make that up.
[295:57.63]They stayed true to their word.
[295:59.79]We're not going to show it.
[296:00.45]I'm back.
[296:15.23]It's like 300 years have passed.
[296:17.65]The guy that brought her here is just a skeleton in the corner.
[296:35.15]Okay.
[296:37.19]That was fun.
[296:49.24]Yeah, it was.
[296:51.24]Do you think the little boy will be able to touch the moon?
[296:54.33]Nobody can touch the moon.
[296:55.87]It's too far away.
[296:56.79]Wait, what if he has a rocket ship?
[296:59.93]Okay, then he can touch it, but it'd be very, very cold.
[297:08.23]You were being silly.
[297:09.45]I don't think the moon feels like a killer.
[297:12.03]I think it does.
[297:14.71]But if...
[297:29.42]Two out of ten.
[297:30.36]Mad.
[297:31.16]Mad.
[297:33.82]No, just that one ten-second period, it was a two out of ten.
[297:39.23]Everything else was like a... It was solid.
[297:42.99]It was fun.
[297:43.75]I think it was worth playing.
[297:44.67]It was... Okay.
[297:45.71]It was... I'll explain.
[297:49.77]Yeah.
[297:57.04]I've played some really shit DLC before.
[297:59.28]This was pretty good.
[298:00.40]That second part with the dolls.
[298:06.55]Wait.
[298:06.71]Wait.
[298:27.24]Don't you ever call me that again?
[298:29.12]It's just a joke.
[298:31.28]It's the end of the first end of the game.
[298:33.36]Show you things even Chris doesn't know I can do.
[298:40.01]So this cutscene takes place.
[298:41.77]Stand down.
[298:43.75]I can handle it.
[298:44.39]She's just a kid.
[298:49.66]Way to keep it together, Rose.
[298:57.37]Wasn't there like a weird ending here?
[299:18.51]Yeah, there was somebody standing here.
[299:19.81]Are we going to see who it is?
[299:32.11]I remember asking that same question at the end of the base game.
[299:43.25]I enjoyed that.
[299:43.83]That was fun.
[299:45.13]Okay, that one segment where I was having trouble with understanding the parry, I didn't get it.
[299:48.83]I thought it was just suck.
[299:50.02]I thought it was an absorb.
[299:50.88]I didn't think it was a parry.
[299:52.38]That was a 2 out of 10.
[299:54.20]Everything else was solid.
[299:55.72]The horror parts were awesome.
[299:57.82]That was scary shit, man.
[299:59.00]I think it was a solid buy here.
[300:00.00]This is a solid buy.
[300:01.94]And there's still more to see.
[300:03.24]Because I want to do the other stuff.
[300:04.30]I want to look at the other stuff.
[300:07.25]There's like a whole other thing to do.
[300:09.51]You can play as Lady Dimitrisu.
[300:12.62]And, um, what's the other guy?
[300:13.98]The mechanical guy?
[300:14.84]I want to try it.
[300:20.38]I thought that was very... I enjoyed that.
[300:24.58]That whole second segment was terrifying.
[300:26.12]I actually, honestly, I really liked 8th.
[300:42.92]I did like 8.
[300:43.98]I thought 8 was really good.
[300:49.05]As a complete picture here, as the whole thing's done at this point, right?
[300:53.07]I actually enjoyed 8.
[301:04.59]What do you rate it?
[301:05.94]I don't know.
[301:06.50]It's a DLC.
[301:07.26]How do you rate a DLC?
[301:08.28]To me, DLC is either buy it or don't.
[301:12.42]You know what I mean?
[301:13.56]It's like an addition.
[301:16.44]Resident Evil 8 is like an 8.5.
[301:20.53]8.4 for me, at least.
[301:24.63]What did I rate it a year ago when I played it?
[301:30.87]I gave it a rating, I think.
[301:35.76]8's better than 7.
[301:38.99]You gave it a 7.
[301:39.65]I think it was like a... It was a high 7, I think.
[301:42.93]Low 8. 8.2.
[301:47.73]Honestly, it's hard to say if I prefer 7 or 8 because I played 8 more recently and it's been a while.
[301:54.05]Guys, something I think a lot of people might not know.
[301:57.43]It's hard for me to give a good scoring system here considering I played the entire game of Resident Evil 7 in VR.
[302:06.93]I played that on the PSVR at launch because it was exclusive and I was like, holy shit, I'm going to do that.
[302:14.10]I don't know why I did that.
[302:16.29]That was so... I should not have done that.
[302:19.53]But I did the entire game from start to finish in VR.
[302:24.96]So, I don't know.
[302:25.50]Maybe I would have a different opinion?
[302:29.02]If I played it normally?
[302:30.00]I don't know.
[302:34.87]I remember feeling really bad after some of those streams.
[302:42.79]It was funny.
[302:48.36]Are we going to get a post credits thing or should I just skip it?
[302:51.64]Just let us know now.
[302:53.68]There's no after credits thing?
[303:07.60]Hey, it re- Wow.
[303:09.52]This is great.
[303:10.24]This is awesome.
[303:11.11]Because this is exactly what I told you was going to happen.
[303:13.89]Exactly what I told you.
[303:14.87]Somebody said, dude, it's a three and a half hour experience.
[303:17.51]If you just play it.
[303:18.61]Three and a half hours.
[303:19.59]Right?
[303:19.75]So 340.
[303:20.99]I've been streaming for five hours.
[303:22.23]That is one hour and 20 minutes of nonsense.
[303:25.92]That's one hour and 20 minutes of me just talking.
[303:28.36]And just like pausing and talking and saying weird shit.
[303:31.06]I told you this was going to happen.
[303:36.70]Okay, cool.
[303:38.78]You've completed the following challenge.
[303:41.12]Completion points can be used to purchase items in the extra content shop.
[303:45.18]Ooh.
[303:47.12]Did I just buy something?
[303:47.86]I hope I just didn't buy something.
[303:54.81]You mean I could have had this on the whole... Did I have this the whole time?
[303:57.45]Or did I just unlock this?
[304:01.29]Why do I feel like I had that already?
[304:05.79]Okay.
[304:08.74]So let me see.
[304:09.58]There's an extra content shop.
[304:12.96]Oh, okay.
[304:13.22]The mercenary's additional orders.
[304:15.42]This is the other thing I want to see.
[304:16.68]But wait.
[304:20.36]Okay, I got it.
[304:22.37]Special weapon.
[304:23.01]80,000.
[304:23.03]I only have 32,000.
[304:28.11]I thought I just had way more than that.
[304:39.05]What, you can play as the baby?
[304:40.23]Oh, no.
[304:43.34]I was like, how did they handle this?
[304:44.62]Okay.
[304:54.53]Do I actually have to unlock them?
[304:56.45]Or are they just in the game?
[304:57.17]They're probably just in the game.
[304:57.93]Okay.
[305:03.23]Okay.
[305:06.54]Additional orders.
[305:07.66]Alright.
[305:08.18]Ethan.
[305:09.12]Chris.
[305:12.87]Oh, there's two other characters.
[305:14.35]Alright.
[305:18.77]I'm going to try it.
[305:20.95]I'll go with Ethan.
[305:23.68]How do I play this?
[305:29.66]There he is.
[305:30.22]That's the duke.
[305:35.71]Okay, the mercenaries.
[305:36.97]First, purchase any equipment and weapons you need from the shop.
[305:40.33]Then, go out to the field.
[305:42.03]You need to defeat as many enemies as possible within the time limit.
[305:44.21]Get a good rhythm going and build up combos.
[305:46.23]Okay.
[305:48.11]The goal will appear.
[305:48.99]Touch the goal to finish.
[305:49.65]Move on to the next area.
[305:51.94]Okay.
[305:55.90]Seems pretty self-explanatory.
[305:57.84]Welcome, Ethan.
[306:01.12]I have 20,000.
[306:04.15]Goodbye.
[306:08.27]Okay.
[306:09.73]You're going to be so bad at this.
[306:11.63]I just want to unlock the... I don't think I can upgrade anything.
[306:17.62]Oh, I can.
[306:18.36]Shit.
[306:18.56]Should I buy something?
[306:19.42]Should I buy the shotgun immediately?
[306:25.81]I hope this one makes itself useful to buy the shotgun and I'm going to upgrade the shotguns.
[306:30.89]Capacity.
[306:33.51]What an idiot, OK?
[306:36.62]Now I'm going to buy shotgun ammo.
[306:42.36]I can't.
[306:45.78]Choose wisely your life till next we meet.
[306:49.20]Oh, I got a lot.
[306:49.86]OK, alright, let's I'm going to just go make some.
[306:52.68]Let's go.
[307:02.39]Get an A rank in a normal stage.
[307:03.99]You got it.
[307:38.47]Go!
[308:09.71]Shotgun ammo.
[308:11.11]Load it, load it, load it, load the shotgun.
[308:12.75]The goal has spawned.
[308:13.61]Wait.
[308:13.85]What's this?
[308:14.31]Oh, where's the goal?
[308:15.21]Where is it?
[308:44.96]Cool.
[308:49.85]Get an A rank or above in all normal stages.
[308:52.97]You need to get an S rank or above.
[308:54.77]Oh my god, am I gonna be able to even do that?
[309:01.56]If it's just looking, window shop away.
[309:07.44]This simple modification can be done in just a moment.
[309:18.11]This is all an investment, Ethan.
[309:21.80]Till next we meet.
[309:26.12]The more kills, the more points.
[309:27.62]Alright.
[309:29.60]Okay.
[309:32.44]Let's just round everybody up then.
[309:34.44]Oh my god, why is it so fucking loud?
[309:37.38]It's ten times louder than the base game.
[310:06.92]Where are they?
[310:10.17]Stop it!
[310:12.27]Stop it!
[310:36.97]Use.
[310:38.28]Yep.
[310:40.44]All right, where are they?
[310:57.43]Where's the enemies?
[311:03.75]Can an enemy spawn?
[311:05.51]Where is an enemy?
[311:37.55]What the fuck are the enemies?
[312:17.12]This guy sucks.
[313:25.49]Gun!
[313:26.13]Gun!
[313:26.75]Gun!
[313:27.67]What the fuck, man?
[313:28.77]I pressed it like three times!
[313:30.25]This stage sucks ass.
[313:54.17]Fuck this stage.
[313:54.93]Worst stage in the game.
[313:56.77]This stage is awful.
[313:58.75]Like, they're up here!
[313:59.35]They're down here!
[313:59.79]They're down here!
[314:00.15]They're up there!
[314:00.53]They're up there!
[314:00.89]They're up there!
[314:01.35]They're up there!
[314:01.96]Oh, fuck this area.
[314:02.94]Okay.
[314:15.20]Oh, good.
[314:15.86]I was just thinking of ways to pass the time.
[314:24.39]Okay, more shotgun.
[314:27.47]I'm doing rate of fire.
[314:31.50]And reloads.
[314:33.06]And then rate of fire.
[314:37.86]This thing is so slow.
[314:42.49]Alright, now that's better.
[314:43.65]Let's go.
[314:56.26]Speed increased.
[314:58.98]Speed increased.
[315:00.28]Why was this gun... Why did you...
[315:31.04]Whoa!
[315:41.95]Open it, open it, open it, open it, open it, open it!
[315:46.27]Where's the bad guy?
[315:46.93]Where's the bad guy?
[315:48.19]Bad guy!
[315:53.89]The bad guys!
[316:17.53]Where we at?
[316:36.67]Where we at?
[316:37.17]Where we at?
[316:42.90]I don't know.
[316:44.62]I don't know where you are.
[316:46.16]You're on.
[316:50.22]It's okay.
[316:50.64]It's alright.
[316:50.90]It's alright.
[316:52.20]It's alright.
[317:00.75]It's alright.
[317:26.59]Ah!
[318:05.67]Alright, let's go!
[318:18.96]Oh!
[318:19.59]Um, hey!
[318:20.57]Yeah!
[318:29.89]That was pretty good!
[318:30.83]Let's go.
[318:31.83]Out, out, out.
[318:32.32]This game's fun.
[318:39.55]How do I know what I got for scores on them?
[318:51.72]A. I need to get an A in every single one of these?
[318:57.56]No.
[319:07.59]In the normal stages.
[319:08.65]Oh, okay.
[319:09.13]Okay.
[319:17.21]So wait, wait, wait, wait.
[319:17.83]Go back.
[319:21.55]So I'm imagining that these are probably only a few of these are normal stages?
[319:30.19]You need A in all and S on the last one.
[319:32.10]Okay.
[319:35.94]Let's see what I can do here.
[319:37.06]I think I'm going to go with... Hmm.
[319:43.02]Hmm.
[319:45.39]Alright, this is... I'm going for a weird play here.
[319:47.90]I'm going to try to... I'm not going to spend any money.
[319:49.46]I'm going to buy the SMG.
[319:50.42]Maybe I'll just do this for now.
[319:54.12]This might be dumb, but I'm going to do it.
[319:56.04]Thank you for your patronage.
[320:21.88]Oh my god.
[320:43.07]I don't remember these guys.
[320:44.27]How do I fight these guys?
[320:47.29]I don't remember how to fight these guys.
[320:48.35]I think they have a thing on their back, right?
[321:03.90]I don't remember.
[321:04.40]I think it's on their back.
[321:18.09]Do you get stuck on the wall?
[321:27.95]I don't know.
[321:31.65]How do you kill these guys?
[321:33.45]I need explosives?
[321:52.35]Hey!
[322:08.27]Oh my god, I just walked right into his drill.
[322:13.10]I'm stuck against the wall.
[322:46.05]I need a key to get in here or something?
[323:34.77]Oh my god!
[323:55.54]Bullshit.
[323:56.64]Bullshit.
[323:56.96]There's one more.
[324:01.43]Where is he?
[324:04.02]Where's the last one?
[324:05.94]Ah, fuck it.
[324:06.44]I don't know.
[324:09.25]Where's the last one?
[324:09.97]Whatever.
[324:10.27]I don't think I'm gonna get an A. If I don't get at least an A on this, then I quit.
[324:24.56]I didn't really put time into this mode, but it's fun.
[324:26.64]Oh, good.
[324:27.30]I was just thinking of ways to pass the time.
[324:35.48]This is all an investment.
[324:37.16]Even this simple modification can be done in just a moment.
[324:47.34]Thank you.
[324:50.08]All right, let's go.
[325:41.88]Oh, it's so loud.
[327:27.28]Fucking clean, if I say.
[327:53.63]Where you at?
[327:55.29]Where are they?
[327:55.73]Oh my god, they're right there!
[328:00.93]Oh, my ears!
[328:09.76]That's a 40-hit combo, dude.
[328:12.42]I didn't stop once.
[328:13.34]That was the cleanest gameplay you've ever seen.
[328:16.10]That was clean.
[328:20.51]That's gonna carry this whole playthrough.
[328:21.79]Okay.
[328:30.58]I like this, this one.
[328:31.16]I think it was going one-gun Andy, I think, right?
[328:41.00]Why was that?
[328:44.87]That was so fast.
[328:51.43]I'll do one-gun Andy.
[328:53.21]Okay, here we go.
[329:19.74]Get that!
[329:23.40]I don't even- I couldn't even read it!
[329:34.63]No!
[330:12.26]Dude, I cracked out on that one.
[330:13.52]I really did.
[330:43.16]Why are you doing this?
[331:38.80]It's too big.
[331:39.42]The area is too big.
[331:52.72]This area's too big.
[331:53.42]I don't know the route.
[331:57.71]It's alright.
[332:10.03]I went to the end first.
[332:11.35]Shit.
[332:12.56]It's okay.
[332:15.86]I kind of was locked into shooting at stuff.
[332:20.60]Where do I go?
[332:30.39]Hup!
[333:14.24]Upstairs, probably, right?
[333:18.70]How did I not go up?
[333:19.86]I can't go up the stairs.
[333:25.04]Whatever.
[333:27.76]Whatever.
[333:45.42]I don't remember where to go.
[333:52.31]No, I went this way already.
[333:57.39]It's too big.
[333:58.67]There's three people left.
[334:00.78]This way?
[334:04.10]Shit.
[334:06.10]That door?
[334:06.66]What do you mean?
[334:07.48]The pit stains are on your shoulders.
[334:10.58]Which door?
[334:11.04]Alright, I'm going to stop moving.
[334:12.38]What door?
[334:14.30]I actually don't know.
[334:15.00]I'm confused.
[334:17.72]From where I'm standing right now.
[334:26.06]This one that I'm looking at right now.
[334:28.60]And then go up, forward, then right.
[334:36.37]Appreciate it.
[334:54.51]Oh my god, this guy's got a demon head!
[335:20.79]Two more.
[335:26.49]Get out!
[335:26.93]Three minutes to spare.
[335:36.28]Alright, hopefully I did okay.
[335:37.24]Hopefully I did alright.
[335:43.55]You gotta find pipe bombs.
[335:45.39]Take a single weapon like a shotgun and sell all the others and the ammo for them.
[335:49.33]Really?
[335:49.85]Oh, that's right.
[335:50.43]I have shotgun ammo.
[335:54.59]Okay.
[335:54.71]Okay.
[335:58.05]So just sell all the shotgun ammo.
[336:04.36]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[336:10.02]Oh my god.
[336:10.88]There's a hundred and... Oh, I could've just went backwards.
[336:24.29]Holy shit, okay.
[336:24.99]Okay.
[336:28.93]Sell.
[336:32.13]How do I say yes?
[336:36.05]This should be enough.
[336:43.30]Leave this to me.
[336:45.22]Oh, I probably shouldn't have sold everything.
[336:46.64]Well, I sold literally every single thing.
[336:53.21]Oh, excellent choice.
[337:10.59]Alright, we'll do Sniper Rifle.
[337:11.59]Can dodge that easily.
[338:12.53]What's that?
[338:12.93]Ugh!
[339:03.88]Oh my god, you're next to me!
[339:05.98]Oh my god!
[339:06.76]Oi!

[341:10.03]The first part wasn't acting, but the second part was.
[341:11.93]Alright, almost there.
[341:54.93]Excuse me.
[341:55.61]Oh my god.
[341:56.43]Oh you're flying away.
[341:57.83]Oh That's not good, I don't think I can kill this I don't think I can kill this
[342:28.25]Yes!
[342:34.54]I have to complete it, I think.
[342:35.58]I'm not going to be able to get them all.
[342:50.01]That's okay.
[342:51.49]How do I get the hell out of here?
[342:59.11]How do I get out of here?
[343:00.05]I don't remember.
[343:00.45]There's only one more.
[343:09.43]It's just the one guy.
[343:10.66]How do I get out of here?
[343:20.32]Grab the mine.
[343:20.80]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[343:34.26]Where is he?
[343:36.79]Oh, shit.
[343:37.49]Okay, get him on the stairs.
[343:38.45]Mine.
[344:10.08]Get out!
[344:10.64]Okay, doors go outside on the second floor, somebody said.
[344:12.70]Is that true?
[344:13.18]Give me the money.
[344:14.88]Did I get the money?
[344:15.48]I got everything.
[344:16.24]Let's go, go, go, go, go.
[344:17.48]Second floor.
[344:18.74]No, no, no, no, no.
[344:19.61]First floor, first floor.
[344:20.35]Go, go, go, go, go.
[344:21.21]Let's go.
[344:28.13]Help.
[344:32.53]Help me.
[344:34.11]Actually, help me.
[344:34.61]I don't know.
[344:38.36]Go towards the icon.
[344:49.12]Okay, good guy.
[344:49.54]I got it.
[344:55.21]This is fun.
[344:55.81]I like this mode a lot.
[344:58.21]With six minutes left?
[345:00.05]Not optimal, but probably an A. I don't care.
[345:08.79]I wonder.
[345:09.09]Give me an A. Yes!
[345:21.09]Very cool.
[345:25.59]So now you're saying if I get an A here, then I can play as the factory guy.
[345:32.45]Let's see rewards.
[345:47.22]It's probably down here, right?
[345:49.94]Okay, unlock.
[345:50.80]Get an A rank or above in all normal stages.
[345:56.89]What classifies a normal stage?
[346:01.31]This is not pre-recorded stream.
[346:02.61]I'm just going to stay with Ethan.
[346:08.59]That's what I know.
[346:13.41]This time, I think I'm going shotgun Andy.
[346:15.41]Naturally.
[346:22.11]Yeah, I'm going shotgun Andy here.
[346:23.51]This one... I'm going for this one.
[346:25.45]Yeah.
[346:25.63]Alright, sell everything else.
[346:26.63]Hmm.
[346:53.51]We want ammo capacity.
[346:58.03]Power.
[346:59.51]Rate of fire.
[347:00.64]Okay, that's good.
[347:01.88]I'll buy a couple of heals.
[347:04.26]Or maybe I should... Yeah, pipe bomb.
[347:06.52]Alright, shotgun time.
[347:11.08]See if I can do this.
[347:16.19]You bought sniper rifle ammo?
[347:17.55]Come on.
[348:13.69]I should have saved that.
[348:14.45]That was dumb.
[348:36.36]Are they standing up or what?
[348:37.34]I don't know.
[349:10.31]We're gaming right now.
[349:28.12]Hurry up.
[349:29.10]Running out of time here.
[349:31.06]Shotgun.
[349:31.42]Yep.
[349:35.86]I lost the combo.
[349:36.84]Fuck.
[350:00.84]What happens if I run out of bullets?
[350:41.27]Oh, I did it.
[350:41.93]Okay.
[350:44.03]I don't think I can do this anymore.
[350:45.65]I think I gotta get out of here.
[350:59.17]I don't... No, I don't think so, man.
[351:02.53]No.
[351:03.51]No, I gotta leave.
[351:04.43]It sucks, but I have to leave.
[351:08.49]Oh, that's not cool.
[351:10.75]Maybe I probably won't get an A then.
[351:17.89]That's bad.
[351:21.01]Oh well.
[351:23.95]Worth a try.
[351:26.91]How do I... I can't get in here?
[351:36.59]Um...
[351:40.15]Why can I not open this?
[351:40.91]Pull a pipe bomb?
[351:57.30]No, it won't work.
[352:01.94]Is a subscriber banner in your About section supposed to lead to a Gotham Knights page?
[352:05.70]No, it's not.
[352:18.03]It's not actually.
[352:20.39]Thank you for bringing that to my attention.
[352:21.71]Alright, I'm kind of sweaty and I think that's probably it for tonight.
[352:27.49]This was fun.
[352:31.23]Plus I'm lost in the concrete level.
[352:39.87]I'm lost in the concrete level.
[352:41.49]I give up.
[352:44.31]I give up.
[352:47.24]Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
[352:52.20]Thanks for joining me.
[352:53.80]I thought I kind of really got into this.
[352:55.34]I didn't think I was going to play this for six hours.
[352:56.80]But tomorrow, we're going to be doing Phasmophobia with Vinny and friends.
[353:05.18]And then after that, I'm going to play At Dead of Night.
[353:10.09]And if I beat that, then we'll do another scary game.
[353:13.37]Should be fun.
[353:17.63]Pam's going to quit.
[353:19.99]That was cool, though.
[353:20.51]I like that.
[353:22.37]Maybe I'll play that on my own.
[353:23.21]Just mess around.
[353:23.85]Is there anything else to see?
[353:37.00]Is that the FMV game?
[353:39.20]I don't know.
[353:39.68]It's like you're running around a hotel or something.
[353:43.36]Third person for the main campaign.
[353:44.94]Yeah, that's cool.
[353:47.45]I feel like you can play through the entire game in third person to be a different game.
[353:52.97]And then on Halloween, yeah, Halloween I'm doing the cooking show with Critical with Charlie.
[353:58.37]That should be fun.
[354:05.07]Should be fun.
[354:08.09]The internet held up today, which is kind of strange.
[354:11.03]We're usually pretty used to it.
[354:12.29]Somewhere around like an hour ago, dying, so.
[354:16.16]I'm just going to pull my streams back an hour or two to try to avoid it.
[354:21.00]I am so sweaty.
[354:22.24]Jesus.
[354:27.40]The idea is I'm trying to avoid being live between 8 and 10.
[354:34.99]So until I can get it fixed, so I reliably know it's not going to happen because it's just so weird.
[354:42.74]Very strange.
[354:45.74]But yeah, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[354:51.22]I'll see you guys very soon.
[354:57.40]Couple more scary games tomorrow.
[355:01.19]What time tomorrow?
[355:01.95]2 p.m.
[355:02.57]Pacific tomorrow.
[355:04.65]And then what time on Halloween?
[355:06.25]That's a good question.
[355:06.77]I think they usually... I think Charlie usually is around noon, right?
[355:12.21]I'm pretty sure it's probably going to be around noon on Halloween.
[355:16.86]But we'll be live 2 p.m.
[355:17.80]tomorrow.
[355:21.82]What about Stay Out of the House?
[355:24.16]I'll play that tomorrow.
[355:35.66]We'll do a bunch of, we'll do at least two or three horror games tomorrow.
[355:39.16]Because Phasmophobia with Vinny is not, I don't think it's going to be very long.
[355:43.47]I think we're only going to do it for an hour or so.
[355:44.81]We're just going to get in and mess around for like an hour, maybe two.
[355:49.71]So there'll be plenty of time to do other stuff.
[355:55.34]You have, you've had an MRI before.
[355:56.78]What was it like?
[355:57.34]I've got one on Monday.
[355:58.12]Okay.
[355:59.59]um it's it's really not a big deal it's you it's all good it just makes a lot of noise they give you usually give you protection for your ears and as long as you just get it's kind of just while you're there while you're in there the way that I have done mris before is I just kind of let the machine make a beat
[356:22.37]And then it's not scary anymore.
[356:24.79]It's not weird anymore.
[356:25.99]Because it goes like this.
[356:28.83]It goes like... So while it's doing that, it's just like... I just make it a music.
[356:32.49]I make it a song.
[356:48.29]And depending if you're doing it with or without contrast, they give you a... Depends what it is, but sometimes they give you an IV.
[356:59.46]But IVs are easy.
[357:01.24]Honestly, if you're doing it with contrast, the IV is the only part that's like, oh, wow, you're doing an IV.
[357:08.26]If you're not doing contrast, then it's not a big deal.
[357:13.60]It'd be good.
[357:16.57]I think you scared them with that voice.
[357:21.87]Thanks for watching, though.
[357:23.67]Well, apparently I'm back.
[357:25.13]Hey, yeah.
[357:26.09]You thought it was over.
[357:27.48]It is.
[357:28.10]Sorry.
[357:28.44]I pressed the wrong button.
[357:30.30]My voice sucks.
[357:34.00]Yeah, but good luck.
[357:34.46]You'll be good.
[357:37.18]It's not so bad.
[357:40.14]I'll see you tomorrow.
[357:41.84]2 p.m.
[357:42.06]Pacific.
[357:44.18]Take care of yourselves.
[357:45.06]Good night.
[357:46.24]See you tomorrow.
[358:12.82]you
[358:47.70]you
