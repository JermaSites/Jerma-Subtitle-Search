[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.65]Sorry, I just like accidentally slammed.
[00:04.24]Sorry for slamming.
[00:07.08]Hi.
[00:11.09]Hey, how are you?
[00:14.82]Late?
[00:15.04]I know.
[00:15.62]Yeah.
[00:17.26]I may have really, really overshot the hole.
[00:19.20]I'm going to fix my sleep schedule in 12 hours thing.
[00:23.02]But I got close.
[00:24.04]I got really close.
[00:25.87]You know I got close.
[00:27.65]Because there's absolutely no way there'd be a stream at like 12.30 Pacific if I didn't get close.
[00:35.91]So, I got close.
[00:37.79]We're not starting.
[00:38.29]It's not 4.00.
[00:42.49]Another reason why we're starting three to four hours early, and typically about the 4 p.m.
[00:48.19]plus time period, is because today is gonna be a double header.
[00:55.78]We're going to play Mario Golf for a little while to pretend that I don't just play Elden Ring.
[01:03.00]It's a way for people to scroll by and see Jerma985 currently live playing Mario Golf.
[01:09.09]Oh, okay.
[01:09.71]Alright.
[01:10.55]He's cool.
[01:12.01]He's variety, right?
[01:13.05]Like, it's... I don't... I mean, I'm not gonna click on that, but... I know he's doing it.
[01:20.04]We're at EU.
[01:20.62]Is EU... Yeah.
[01:21.42]Is that what I mean?
[01:25.22]It's for people to understand that I don't just play Elden Ring.
[01:29.36]And then we're gonna play Elden Ring.
[01:32.09]So this is just for the scrollers, the first four or five hours of this stream.
[01:36.96]I'm gonna take a break.
[01:39.00]A real break.
[01:40.80]One that I don't think I've ever done on this channel.
[01:44.84]I have never done what I'm going to do today.
[01:47.52]So I'm very, very intrigued to see how this works.
[01:53.83]Somewhere in the next four or five hours, I'm going to put up the BRB screen.
[02:02.63]With some text on it.
[02:07.97]Saying that I'll be back in like 20 to 30 minutes.
[02:11.17]We're going to do a legit 20 minute break.
[02:14.66]Halfway through here.
[02:17.48]We're going to come back.
[02:20.38]Somewhere around that.
[02:22.12]Whatever that is.
[02:24.12]And do Elden Ring for the rest of the night.
[02:28.95]Your views are going to plummet.
[02:34.83]I mean, yeah, they are.
[02:36.13]Of course they are.
[02:38.04]But this would be a good... This is a nice little science experiment, don't you think?
[02:43.86]I'm very curious how this works.
[02:48.94]Intermission Andy.
[02:49.82]Yeah.
[02:53.54]So we're going to do about four or five hours now, and then four or five hours later, bringing us to an omega time period of about ten hours or so today.
[03:03.99]Maybe less, maybe more, depending.
[03:06.77]I also have to get ready for the streamer rewards, because I haven't even prepared at all.
[03:11.38]So, this will be the last stream you see on this channel for a little while.
[03:17.06]I will be at the streamer rewards.
[03:18.96]You can watch it.
[03:20.14]Yeah, I'm sure you'll be able to pick me out of the crowd at some point.
[03:24.43]I will be there.
[03:27.66]So, as of today, I will see you on this channel after today.
[03:34.08]Next week.
[03:38.27]Oh, fucking poggies?
[03:40.73]Yeah, poggies.
[03:44.61]Poggies.
[03:45.97]God.
[03:48.08]Alright, I'm gonna have no cam on because this is the first time in like three weeks that I've been able to have no shirt on when I stream.
[03:54.29]So I'm gonna, I'm doing that.
[03:56.45]I'll have a cam on Elden Ring when I take my break.
[03:58.57]I'll put a shirt on.
[03:59.17]So you're gonna deal with no cam for like, I don't know, however long I pretend to play Mario Golf.
[04:04.42]Oh, also somebody bet me something in chat.
[04:06.94]The person that said, hey dude, play Mario Golf is the same person that also said, if you don't give this game at least a 7 out of 10, ban me for a month.
[04:16.76]What I said is, I mean, you're kind of already going up against some pretty intense odds, considering that all the Mario sports games are like five or sixes.
[04:28.10]I mean, like, I think I'm going to give this a seven.
[04:30.32]I don't know if you're going to get a seven out of this.
[04:38.47]That's a bad take.
[04:39.69]Well, at least in the last 10 years.
[04:41.35]Mario, Sonic, and Olympic Games.
[04:42.53]Was that a 6?
[04:42.81]What was it?
[04:44.76]Let's be real.
[04:45.28]Let's go.
[04:45.72]Come on.
[04:46.22]Let's be honest.
[04:47.28]What would you give a score to Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games?
[04:51.44]What is it?
[04:52.98]Is it a 6 or a 7?
[04:53.62]Is it a 5?
[04:57.26]7 for nostalgia?
[04:58.22]Okay, but that doesn't count.
[04:59.98]Is it probably a 6?
[05:02.22]It's a 6 for the Wii.
[05:03.26]Okay.
[05:08.98]Alright, what's the last Mario Sports game?
[05:11.08]Mario Tennis for the Switch.
[05:13.78]Mmm!
[05:14.76]That's like a 6.
[05:15.62]That was like a 6.5.
[05:16.52]I'm seeing a lot of 7s.
[05:25.01]I'm seeing a lot of 6s and 7s.
[05:27.97]So, how is that a bad take when it's everybody's take in the chat?
[05:31.99]Besides, like, at least, like, ow.
[05:37.50]No, you can't put stuff in the Wii.
[05:39.58]You guys keep forgetting the Wii is more than... The Wii is like fucking 15 years old now.
[05:44.93]I'm talking about like current gen.
[05:47.57]And a little bit of last gen.
[05:48.95]Like the last 5 to 10 years.
[05:51.01]You give me a Mario sports game that was like a 9.
[05:53.09]Not gonna happen.
[05:59.73]They're fun.
[06:00.23]They're not bad games.
[06:10.84]about uh Mario strikers yeah that game's fantastic I'm looking forward to the next one that might that actually might be the first like Mario sports game in five to ten years that actually is like a nine for me it could be that game was absolutely unbelievable Mario strikers charged
[06:37.45]Honestly, I think my opinion just soured.
[06:38.89]Just based on Mario Tennis.
[06:44.20]Like, right now, on my screen, I just see Mario with a tennis racket.
[06:49.35]It's fucking infuriating me.
[06:52.71]Like, you know what I mean?
[06:53.61]That's a tennis racket, and I'm pissed off about it.
[06:59.66]Anytime Mario wears regular clothes, just like that aren't his overalls and his shirt, like when he wears just like pants, like suit pants, it pisses, I get mad.
[07:09.36]Because I know it's either a tennis game or a golf game.
[07:16.48]I'm already mad.
[07:17.10]Alright, maybe I should stop.
[07:29.34]I'm just kidding, Jesus Christ.
[07:31.68]Alright, what should I do?
[07:32.53]I don't want to, like, do all this.
[07:35.05]I want to, like, play golf.
[07:39.93]I'm just going to play golf.
[07:42.71]I know there's, like, an RPG mode in this game, right?
[07:45.02]Do I really want to do that?
[07:45.88]I'll go do golf adventure.
[07:47.02]I'm not playing ranked.
[07:58.36]Golf Adventure.
[07:59.28]Okay.
[07:59.80]So I have to make a Mii?
[08:01.22]Is that how this works?
[08:05.60]There I am.
[08:06.14]I'm already made.
[08:06.72]Dominant hand is set to right.
[08:11.02]Yeah, that's fine.
[08:16.23]How do you have blonde hair?
[08:17.35]I don't know.
[08:17.77]I made it in 10 seconds.
[08:18.79]Are there scan lines?
[08:30.42]Why the scan line?
[08:31.36]Oh, it's on TV.
[08:42.40]Hey, you turned it off at the worst possible time.
[08:52.61]Erdo.
[08:53.17]Oh, it looks like Mario just won.
[08:54.59]Isn't that the end of the tourney?
[08:58.14]Did you see how he won?
[08:59.47]That was ridiculous.
[09:00.33]I need to see a replay.
[09:02.41]Don't I beat the shit out of these people on a daily basis?
[09:06.49]Why would they be... Why are they like fans of mine?
[09:09.67]Okay.
[09:16.25]Oh, sorry, Chuck.
[09:16.97]But remember, the welcome ceremony tomorrow is more important than watching TV.
[09:20.21]He he he.
[09:23.15]Birdo's right.
[09:24.45]We should all get some good sleep tonight.
[09:25.71]I feel like we're going to need it.
[09:28.13]Thank you.
[09:28.49]How wonderful to have at least one sensible rookie in the house.
[09:33.04]Oh, these are players.
[09:33.92]Okay.
[09:34.02]I thought they were just like people watching.
[09:37.78]I'll sleep just fine.
[09:39.16]What about you?
[09:39.72]I didn't even know ghosts could sleep.
[09:41.88]You don't just fall through the bed?
[09:43.44]Chuck, I feel like that's a rude question to ask a ghost.
[09:48.43]Anyway, I guess I'll go to bed too.
[09:50.83]I want to make a good impression at the welcome ceremony tomorrow.
[09:54.58]That's a good idea, dear.
[09:56.34]I know you're hoping to be one of the standouts in this rookie class.
[09:59.36]Gosh, you can't out-drive me.
[10:01.80]Sorry, Toadette, but you're always going to be playing catch up to the real heavy hitters.
[10:05.25]Excuse me, you can't always win with power alone, you know.
[10:09.85]You've got to keep a level head and know when to lay up.
[10:12.11]Happy Gilmore would say otherwise.
[10:17.19]You've got both wrong.
[10:19.17]Finesse is the name of the game.
[10:25.08]Who's this guy?
[10:25.92]Oh, it's me.
[10:26.50]This feels weird.
[10:30.34]I feel like I'm in a Sims house, right?
[10:34.46]Oh, it's you.
[10:34.94]We've been waiting for you.
[10:35.78]Come join us, please.
[10:39.78]Everyone, please allow me to introduce the final rookie in your group, Jeremy.
[10:44.96]What's that?
[10:46.95]You're a rookie, too?
[10:48.39]How much did you overhear?
[10:49.51]I mean, nice to meet you.
[10:53.56]Guess the golf association called to let us know that one more rookie would be arriving late.
[10:57.30]Now they're here.
[10:57.82]Alright, alright, so how far can you drive it, Rook?
[11:02.34]You want to tee it up and see?
[11:04.19]Come on, Chuck.
[11:04.71]He's got an oversized driver for a brain.
[11:08.01]Come on, everyone.
[11:08.51]You'll be all learning together.
[11:09.85]You guys wanted me to play the fucking RPG mode.
[11:11.95]It's going to take like four hours to get started.
[11:17.09]I could have already driven the ball 400 yards by now.
[11:20.43]The name's Chargin' Chuck.
[11:21.87]I hit the long ball.
[11:23.99]Boom!
[11:24.97]Don't matter where it goes as long as it goes far.
[11:27.17]Giddy up!
[11:29.43]I'm Toadette.
[11:30.09]It's great to meet another student of the game.
[11:31.84]I hope we can all learn from each other.
[11:33.22]Hi, Boo!
[11:35.32]Um, Boo, hee hee!
[11:37.70]Edit.
[11:37.96]Any other characters that every human on Earth has seen more than a thousand times that we need introductions for?
[11:42.88]I'm being really, like, rude to this game.
[11:46.69]Alright, yeah, I'm outta here.
[11:47.65]I gotta lift anyway.
[11:48.39]If you wanna hit up the green, your bicep's gotta be mean.
[11:52.35]Well, I was on my way to bed.
[11:53.29]The most important thing for strong muscles is recovery.
[11:55.59]Wait, we have to do, like, exercises?
[11:56.77]I don't understand the obsession with muscles that seems to plague those of you with physical bodies.
[12:02.56]Anyway, off to bed.
[12:03.30]Hee hee hee.
[12:06.20]It's quite a crew we have.
[12:09.84]What am I thinking?
[12:10.46]You must be exhausted.
[12:11.32]Why don't you head to your room and get some rest?
[12:15.68]I'm Birdo, the camp house mama.
[12:18.50]You can even call me mama if you want.
[12:22.39]I wanted to go- Okay.
[12:23.99]Now your room is the one in the back.
[12:26.00]We've got the- We've got a big welcome ceremony tomorrow.
[12:28.70]Go get rest.
[12:33.19]R1, R1, R1, R1.
[12:39.17]Oh, this is Charge and Chuck's room.
[12:40.36]What's in there?
[12:46.60]Alright, I'm just going to bed.
[12:47.34]Alright, I gotta be very honest with everybody here.
[12:49.96]Let me be incredibly honest.
[12:52.06]I don't care about any of this lore.
[12:54.74]I don't care at all.
[12:55.66]Zero.
[12:58.57]I don't want to knock on everybody's door and see what they're doing.
[13:00.99]I don't... I don't care.
[13:03.81]I just don't.
[13:04.27]I'm sorry.
[13:04.95]Does that make me a bad person for not caring about the storyline in Mario Golf?
[13:10.75]I just want to drive a ball.
[13:11.91]Hard.
[13:13.81]Meet the manager in the front of the clubhouse.
[13:17.67]They're your friends?
[13:18.37]They're not my friends!
[13:18.97]I just moved in!
[13:20.59]I just moved in five seconds ago.
[13:22.12]These people don't know who I am.
[13:22.98]I'm in Boo's room.
[13:30.08]What's Charge and Chuck up to?
[13:43.62]You know what?
[13:44.12]I do, I will commend companies like Nintendo and other companies that have tried to make just, hey, let's play golf, um, a better, more interesting kind of fun experience rather than just what, you know, just turning around at the tee and driving the ball out of bounds like a thousand yards the wrong way and then literally turning the game off because that's what I've done at every golf game I've ever played.
[14:15.93]Hope you're feeling rested.
[14:16.65]Did you get a good night's sleep?
[14:17.70]I did.
[14:20.82]Oh, good.
[14:21.14]I didn't wake you because you seemed like you really needed the rest.
[14:24.69]But now you're running late for the welcome ceremony.
[14:26.59]Head outside and straight down the road.
[14:27.77]Hurry!
[14:31.72]Why is it pointing there?
[14:32.68]Okay, wait.
[14:39.29]R1, R1, R1.
[14:40.29]Just one more thing.
[14:42.43]Everyone in town knows that we have a new class of rookies starting out.
[14:45.83]So you'll have a lot of eyes on you and expect some pretty high expectations.
[14:51.10]Just put your best foot forward, alright?
[14:55.10]Oh, I better not turn all the way 100%, 180 degrees in the wrong direction and drive.
[15:02.03]Shouldn't do that.
[15:04.39]Bonnie Greens!
[15:13.95]Seems ugly.
[15:23.92]This place is filled with talented rookies, but let's pump the brakes a bit.
[15:27.16]Not everyone can be a star on day one.
[15:28.72]Let's give these... What's wrong with this?
[15:30.83]Something's wrong.
[15:33.77]Sounds a bit like the alicing.
[15:35.19]This looks off.
[15:36.01]Why does it look so wrong?
[15:38.23]Is it like the anti-alicing?
[15:39.13]You're the rookie everyone's talking about, right?
[15:45.36]Bunny Green says world-class practicing courses.
[15:47.26]Okay.
[15:50.68]No, I'm just... Honestly, like, I... This is a difference than the other Nintendo games.
[15:56.46]Usually the alicing doesn't look this bad.
[16:00.43]Nice to meet you.
[16:00.93]I'm the head coach.
[16:06.61]Alright, let's do the ceremony.
[16:11.21]A 3090?
[16:11.29]I'm on a switch right now, dude.
[16:13.12]Come on.
[16:18.78]Okay, everyone's here, coach.
[16:26.79]Welcome, rookies!
[16:27.81]Yeah?
[16:28.23]I hope you all realize how lucky you are to get a chance to write your own chapter in the Bonnie Green story.
[16:40.08]I'm the clubhouse manager here, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to this rookie class.
[16:44.66]Now, you just met our head coach.
[16:46.72]He has a lot to offer, so I hope you all take his lessons.
[16:48.60]After all, he's launched the careers of several top players.
[16:54.70]Hey, thanks for that.
[16:55.83]Now, you're all here for a reason.
[16:57.39]You've got the raw talent to make it in life.
[16:59.81]That doesn't mean it can be easy.
[17:01.03]I'll help you make sure you make it all.
[17:05.99]Very well, then.
[17:06.61]I'll go ahead and pass this up.
[17:09.36]This is a golf watch.
[17:10.30]Rookies, it'll track your stats, record your scores, and a whole lot more.
[17:14.30]Come on, get one.
[17:16.22]George and Chuck.
[17:16.86]That's me.
[17:18.00]Where's my watch?
[17:20.47]I hear you drive the ball a little bit.
[17:21.93]Let's see if we can't teach you some control.
[17:23.65]I feel like I'm an AI reading this.
[17:26.05]Control, that gonna help me hit it farther?
[17:27.77]I wanna play as that guy.
[17:31.89]Just mash the A button.
[17:39.50]I don't care.
[17:40.00]I don't care about these guys getting their watches.
[17:42.56]I just want my watch.
[17:47.94]I hear you're a real prodigy, but rough around the edges.
[17:50.58]Just like the fairway, I guess.
[17:52.67]Just made that up.
[17:56.01]Alright, that's enough for intros.
[17:57.27]Go ahead and slap those new golf watches on your wrists.
[18:00.91]Get the golf watch on.
[18:03.31]Your data's already in there.
[18:04.51]Like magic, just press on and make sure it looks right.
[18:09.26]first screen that comes up should be pretty basic.
[18:11.39]It shows the different aliens you can turn into.
[18:13.41]This one's a small alien and can get in small places and has a high-pitched voice.
[18:17.53]This one is a big strong alien, but sometimes it's hard to tell which one you're gonna get.
[18:20.70]Just smash it and just be a good TV show.
[18:23.06]Don't worry about all the advanced functions right now, okay?
[18:29.02]Now I'm gonna go over the badge system.
[18:30.57]No, no badge system.
[18:31.85]Okay, this is actually kind of cool.
[18:35.06]You see where it says steel badge?
[18:36.64]One day, when you reach the top, it might say platinum instead.
[18:39.42]Okay.
[18:42.58]I can go 160 yards?
[18:43.08]Alright, so you play tournaments, there's training, there's leveling up, yeah.
[18:48.35]That's cool.
[18:51.45]New member of the team.
[18:54.31]It's Toad.
[19:00.28]Hey everyone, I'm Toad.
[19:01.62]I've been looking forward to this for quite a long time.
[19:04.03]Golf is more popular than ever in the Mushroom Kingdom.
[19:07.83]Wasn't that tourney yesterday incredible?
[19:11.78]But if we want to keep the sport interesting, we need some grand players, you see.
[19:17.79]And I just don't meet folks who can hit the green.
[19:19.93]Oh, whoa, hey.
[19:22.47]This is crazy.
[19:23.41]That's all I had to do was just clear my throat.
[19:25.67]We need some fresh faces on the leaderboards.
[19:27.81]That's where you all come in.
[19:28.77]We've scouted each of you for your special talents.
[19:30.43]Maybe you're a big star.
[19:31.99]Okay.
[19:37.01]Okay.
[19:39.89]That wasn't even a bad impression.
[19:41.37]You know how bad all Toad impressions are?
[19:43.67]Never mind.
[19:52.06]Who's my caddy?
[19:56.06]Have you guys noticed that all the Mario characters have gotten regular voices except for that guy?
[20:03.98]All the Mario characters are like, Whoa!
[20:06.74]Hey!
[20:09.52]And now, but this guy's still They've never changed it.
[20:14.72]It's always been that.
[20:29.10]Oh, nice.
[20:29.44]Alright, time to play.
[20:30.76]I went up the golf watch.
[20:34.18]I don't need the golf watch.
[20:34.98]Alright, let's go meet the caddy.
[20:38.81]Hi.
[20:38.89]Hi.
[20:43.51]Yes, I'm Jeremy.
[20:44.87]I've been waiting for you.
[20:45.69]Alright, so you're my caddy.
[20:46.96]So just tell me what clubs to use.
[20:50.10]Okay, I'm here for the package.
[20:50.98]Yes.
[20:51.14]You don't have any idea what I'm talking about, do you?
[20:54.46]I'm here to give you your first set of clubs.
[21:01.54]They're already customized perfectly.
[21:02.94]Okay.
[21:03.99]Now when you're playing around here, you'll be chasing after your ball on your own two legs.
[21:06.91]No carts.
[21:07.53]I did see that from the trailer.
[21:09.99]That's probably going to be the fun part of the game.
[21:16.02]We won't load you up with a full set of 14 clubs.
[21:18.94]I only need three.
[21:20.98]I never understood all the multiple clubs thing in golf.
[21:23.48]Give me the driver, the putter, and the pitching wedge.
[21:26.90]That's all I need.
[21:27.56]That's all you're going to see me play with.
[21:28.62]Alright, that's enough for me.
[21:32.97]Go ahead and strap on the bag.
[21:38.33]You got a set of golf clubs.
[21:40.07]Okay, cool.
[21:43.87]I need a huge driver.
[21:50.41]Those big, huge, like titanium rod in the middle drivers.
[21:56.94]It was an infomercial for them all the time.
[21:59.90]And that shit was illegal to play with in tournaments.
[22:03.72]That's the Driver Master 400 El Diablo driver or something, right?
[22:09.92]And these things, you couldn't use them in tournaments.
[22:12.94]You couldn't use them and play with them in an actual setting.
[22:18.22]The thing was, like, it was almost a foot long.
[22:21.68]And it had this huge piece of titanium in the middle, and it was, like, guaranteed to, like... It was like a corked bat.
[22:27.69]I used to see that commercial all the fucking time.
[22:31.05]You physically couldn't even play with it.
[22:32.75]Unless you, like, were just driving with, like, you know, somebody had dickhead friends in the driving range.
[22:44.47]Satan Driver.
[22:45.63]I swear to God, it was something like that.
[22:50.41]Alright, so I'm just gonna go this way.
[22:51.79]Take some lessons- Alright, here we go!
[23:06.35]I'm ready.
[23:08.75]Let's go!
[23:10.81]You want to review the basics of hitting a shot?
[23:12.57]I mean, I kind of need to know what I'm doing.
[23:15.44]Alright, that aims, that aims.
[23:16.93]Yep, yep, yep.
[23:18.51]That shows the overhead view.
[23:19.87]Very cool.
[23:22.31]The inner circle shows where the ball will land.
[23:24.91]Ah, okay.
[23:27.21]And then the translucent outside border shows where it will roll.
[23:30.60]Okay.
[23:32.46]The sum of the shots carried and run equals its total distance.
[23:34.84]Distance is also affected by shot power, wind speed, and direction.
[23:38.10]And elevation changes.
[23:39.16]Okay.
[23:39.36]Here's a gauge.
[23:41.76]Press it.
[23:42.35]Bing, bing.
[23:43.67]There it is.
[23:45.21]Okay.
[23:48.11]By the way, you'll need 60 points to pass this lesson.
[23:49.97]Alright, I got it.
[23:50.63]I got it.
[23:50.95]This is gonna be easy.
[23:55.90]Easy.
[23:56.20]Simple.
[23:56.60]Let's go.
[23:59.16]I got a pro controller in my hand right now.
[24:00.52]Alright.
[24:02.42]If you want to get precise, the blue section of the target will score you the most points.
[24:07.82]Okay.
[24:08.00]Of course, that isn't always the best spot to be.
[24:12.18]That will depend on where the wind is.
[24:13.56]Okay.
[24:14.40]Aim for the blue area.
[24:15.24]Okay, cool.
[24:18.86]Let's take a look.
[24:21.74]There it is.
[24:23.96]So that's 160 yards.
[24:24.80]We're going to go right here.
[24:25.66]What's wrong with that?
[24:35.52]Alright, 10 points.
[24:36.24]I did it.
[24:43.93]Okay.
[24:48.85]Nice.
[24:50.43]Yeah, I want it to roll.
[24:51.15]I don't want to do it.
[24:52.75]If it's 160 yards away, you don't hit the ball 160 yards.
[24:57.22]Well, that was bullshit.
[24:58.20]That was actually bullshit.
[25:06.54]Why have you not turned around yet?
[25:07.74]Because this is the fucking practice area, dude.
[25:10.83]I'm not going to do that in the practice zone.
[25:24.33]The point is to hit it exactly 160 yards.
[25:26.99]The point is to get it into the 10.
[25:28.13]That's not gonna be enough.
[25:36.69]I'm undershooting it a little.
[25:49.14]How did that feel?
[25:49.74]Were you able to hit the shots where you wanted?
[25:51.28]Yeah.
[25:53.12]Next we'll hit five more shots, but now we're going to get more aggressive and set up for a birdie.
[25:59.03]Okay.
[26:00.81]Let's get more aggressive.
[26:02.81]Alright, sure.
[26:03.33]So I need to smash this as hard as I can.
[26:05.17]Why are you playing the golf tutorial?
[26:18.32]I'm... I was gonna jump into golf, but people said do the adventure mode.
[26:27.22]They wanted to hear a toad yell at him for fucking an hour.
[26:29.48]Alright, that was good.
[26:45.78]I can shape the shot, too.
[26:46.88]Is this a fast forward?
[26:48.14]Oh, there is.
[26:48.58]Okay, yeah, let's go.
[26:54.23]How can I shape?
[26:54.89]Let's see.
[26:57.81]Oh, you can curve it.
[26:59.77]Oh, shit.
[27:07.27]I can't wait to try to curve a ball around an entire forest.
[27:15.33]Alright, that's 60 points.
[27:19.78]Do I level up?
[27:20.40]Okay, power has leveled up.
[27:25.40]Cool.
[27:27.86]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:28.56]I want it to be power.
[27:36.27]Oh, you crushed it.
[27:38.07]You gotta play it safe, too.
[27:39.13]Not to take anything away from this performance, but you've always gotta improve.
[27:43.12]I don't care.
[27:45.25]Pick some lessons.
[27:52.67]From who?
[27:57.99]Power only.
[27:58.81]That's what I'm doing.
[28:02.82]I'm going to put every single point into distance.
[28:05.38]And just have the giant infomercial driver.
[28:07.50]That's illegal.
[28:08.22]And I'm just going to win every tournament.
[28:13.31]Alright, 30-yard approach on flat ground using your wedge.
[28:20.49]Okay.
[28:24.09]Get the ball into the green.
[28:24.91]I know how it works.
[28:37.60]Me strong.
[28:40.03]Alright, I got my pitching wedge, so you want to pretty much just pitch it on there.
[28:45.17]Almost a hole-in-one.
[28:51.22]Nice.
[29:01.62]Yeah, this is simple.
[29:04.44]We need a me-strong golf swing.
[29:12.79]Nice!
[29:13.47]Alright, approach shots are key to scoring well.
[29:21.29]We're on pretty level ground, it seems.
[29:27.94]Okay.
[29:31.44]With 30 yards of elevation to gain, count four.
[29:34.96]Got to carry a little farther.
[29:39.54]No, just get the ball into the hole.
[29:41.24]That's all I need to know.
[29:42.88]Nothing else matters.
[29:43.55]Just get it in.
[29:53.03]Don't tell me, well, you see this elevation in it.
[29:55.01]No, just put ball into hole.
[30:15.37]Why are you still here?
[30:21.32]Alright, we're uphill now.
[30:23.76]The hole is one yard downhill and 98 feet away.
[30:33.73]Okay, alright, alright, alright, get out of my way.
[30:43.85]Easy.
[30:44.66]Right in.
[30:45.68]That was good.
[30:46.16]That was good.
[30:47.88]He's gonna say okay every time.
[30:49.58]Okay.
[30:56.07]That's the streamer curse.
[30:57.47]Don't you understand?
[30:58.53]I don't want more than three or four seconds to go by without any sound effects.
[31:04.88]Think about that.
[31:05.44]Five seconds of no talking is like, it's like streamer dog years.
[31:12.40]It's like, it might as well be 30 minutes.
[31:14.44]It's like five straight minutes.
[31:23.61]Okay.
[31:26.33]Fuck!
[31:31.15]Okay.
[31:34.25]You wanna do the V- Alright, I'll do the- I gotta just do the- Let me just do this.
[31:44.91]Well, the goal is to get the ball into the thing.
[31:51.02]Kid Boga!
[31:51.70]Kid Boga coming in for a raid!
[31:52.96]What's up, Kid?
[31:55.90]Welcome, everybody.
[31:56.44]We're currently playing Mario Golf.
[32:04.09]Uh, this is just breaking it up a little bit.
[32:05.77]Because I'm going to be playing Elden Ring later.
[32:11.82]But, thanks Kit.
[32:13.20]Hope you had a good stream.
[32:17.36]Hope it was eventful.
[32:21.26]More Elden Ring, that's a nerd game.
[32:23.92]Well just watch this stream then.
[32:26.34]This is going to be two today.
[32:33.22]He's playing this as the meme.
[32:35.14]No, actually, this is... I'm genuinely... When I saw the trailer for this, I genuinely thought it was interesting looking.
[32:40.13]Alright, so I gotta be careful.
[32:45.65]So this is... We're going up.
[32:49.19]I gotta hit it a little bit harder.
[32:50.25]Just a little bit.
[32:50.81]Not very much.
[33:08.09]So, this is not just going to be golf.
[33:09.89]This is going to be... What are those... What are those guys called?
[33:13.89]The... Stompers?
[33:16.72]What are they called?
[33:17.18]They're going to be all over the green and stuff, right?
[33:22.64]This one's downhill all the way.
[33:24.20]Alright, but that was not enough at all.
[33:30.83]That's fine.
[33:43.70]Nice on.
[33:46.52]Yerma hates video games.
[33:48.32]I don't hate video games.
[33:56.55]This is to change it up a little.
[33:58.97]Alright.
[34:00.93]Try the rookie course.
[34:01.99]Let's go.
[34:03.75]It's time to go.
[34:04.47]Let's go for it.
[34:06.65]Alright, was the person saying that if you don't think this game is at least a 7 out of 10, then you should ban me for a month?
[34:11.66]Um...
[34:13.23]You're about to find out if I actually like this game.
[34:17.17]Okay, this is the rookie course.
[34:27.26]This is cute, though.
[34:28.14]It actually is cute.
[34:29.52]I actually like this.
[34:30.10]I don't know how a shift can affect... No.
[34:37.11]Toad, fuck off.
[34:39.57]Stop calling me.
[34:43.24]Three hulls.
[34:44.72]Finishing five over par or better to pass.
[34:47.52]That's a pass?
[34:54.32]It's like a super bogey.
[35:00.80]Alright, 11 mile per hour wind.
[35:01.75]Downhill slope, 7.3 yards.
[35:05.31]We don't care about any of those.
[35:06.11]We're just going to drive over them.
[35:09.91]Alright.
[35:10.83]I think I got a pretty good idea.
[35:29.42]Yeah!
[35:31.14]He did the funny thing, right?
[35:43.46]I love somebody in the chat just wrote.
[35:46.16]Oh my god, he's so funny.
[35:53.70]That was not bad.
[35:54.33]Alright, now how far here?
[35:55.41]120 yards?
[35:55.57]Downhill?
[36:05.49]The driver.
[36:08.06]Can I use the driver on the green?
[36:13.62]If you can, that's really funny.
[36:15.72]Yeah, you can.
[36:23.49]Can you fucking imagine somebody doing this?
[36:34.01]Alright, that's... I got one more stroke and I'm good.
[36:41.31]I got it.
[36:42.48]Oh no.
[36:56.00]I think I can get this in one go.
[36:59.12]Ready?
[37:03.84]No, not quite.
[37:04.50]I'm going to go this way, though.
[37:08.80]Play seriously.
[37:09.69]I'm doing it right now.
[37:15.17]He's going to fail the rookie course.
[37:16.93]I'm not going to fail the rookie course.
[37:19.61]Watch.
[37:20.07]Is that going to hit the tree?
[37:25.26]I feel like that's going to hit the tree.
[37:26.90]Let's find out.
[37:36.41]That's too far, way too far, way too far.
[37:40.29]I thought I was gonna go through the leaves and get all fucked up.
[37:42.91]Alright, I gotta chip this.
[37:48.97]Real lightly here.
[37:54.33]It's not bad.
[37:54.73]Fuck you.
[38:09.23]Am I at plus four?
[38:11.15]Oh, shit.
[38:14.31]Okay, I can't be plus five, so I actually have to do- Okay, no fucking around.
[38:17.01]I actually have to do this well.
[38:20.42]This is perfect for me.
[38:22.34]It's 143 yards.
[38:28.28]I gotta go, like, kind of somewhere, like, here.
[38:30.52]Like, right here.
[38:32.11]Get on the green.
[38:40.96]Oh, fuck off.
[38:44.62]Alright, this is uphill.
[38:47.78]This'll do it.
[38:50.76]Right in!
[38:52.35]Yes!
[38:54.69]I'm good.
[39:02.83]Plus three.
[39:09.19]Level up twice?
[39:11.62]Ooh.
[39:16.09]I want to get that to at least 200 yards, or 180.
[39:18.45]That was just kind of fun.
[39:27.01]Three holes and a time limit.
[39:31.11]And score well, too.
[39:32.29]You have 10 minutes to finish par 3, par 4, and a par 5.
[39:35.17]It's called speed golf.
[39:41.10]Speed golf?
[39:45.00]Wait, I have to run around now.
[39:47.33]Alright, how does this work?
[39:50.29]Huh?
[39:53.59]Dash?
[39:55.69]You can push people out of the way.
[40:02.76]There's a special dash.
[40:09.26]This just seems kind of chaotic.
[40:13.56]Okay, so this is a time limit.
[40:14.99]Finish three holes at plus three or better in ten minutes or less.
[40:26.90]Ready?
[40:29.94]So I'm actually playing against other players?
[40:44.03]Oh fuck, I have to run!
[40:51.08]Okay.
[41:04.07]Alright, birdie putt.
[41:05.63]What's it look like?
[41:08.73]Alright, so this is, um... Blue means it's going up, and the red means it's going down.
[41:15.69]Right?
[41:20.06]What do we got for wind?
[41:22.14]Wind is down a lot.
[41:22.94]Okay, I'm just gonna... I think it was too hard.
[41:29.24]Oh, he got it!
[41:29.76]What do you mean he got it?
[41:31.66]I did it.
[41:32.00]I did it.
[41:33.76]He got it.
[41:34.36]I got it.
[41:42.28]Okay, cool.
[41:44.14]Oh shit, alright.
[41:45.04]We're gonna go... I'm going this way.
[41:48.32]Is that stupid?
[41:49.96]Yeah, it is pretty stupid.
[41:52.36]Let's drive it as far as I can.
[41:53.48]That was a bomb.
[42:06.23]I only have eight and a half minutes.
[42:12.16]That's so funny that you can actually punch people and push people.
[42:14.34]Go faster?
[42:23.11]Like, this is as fast as the character can move!
[42:27.35]Alright, 148.
[42:28.01]We're gonna go... This is curving a little.
[42:30.53]Where's the wind?
[42:32.31]Alright, wind's not bad.
[42:33.83]Let's go.
[42:38.09]It's gonna be on the green.
[42:44.50]Green?
[42:46.32]Tell me!
[42:49.18]Green!
[42:50.86]Fringe.
[42:51.36]What's fringe mean?
[42:55.98]Ah, right at the end.
[42:56.66]Right at the lip.
[42:58.60]Alright, wind's coming down to the left a little.
[43:04.90]So... He's 100 foot.
[43:08.53]We're going probably like 30 feet.
[43:10.31]We're going up.
[43:10.89]I'm gonna go tighten it up a little bit this way.
[43:12.97]We're gonna go for it.
[43:17.86]Sorry, sorry.
[43:23.25]Cringe, cringe.
[43:28.69]Oh, come on.
[43:29.73]What the fuck?
[43:32.81]What happened?
[43:33.99]Wait, what?
[43:37.50]I have no idea what just happened.
[43:43.52]Ready?
[43:45.28]Alright, well I got it.
[43:46.34]Whatever.
[43:52.89]I'm going here, and I'm gonna go over the sand trap.
[44:02.26]You can't get a golf cart.
[44:10.62]I mean, this is kind of cool, but... Isn't this the exact reason why people play golf video games?
[44:18.53]Because this is the worst part of golf.
[44:27.87]Actually, needing to go to get the ball is like the... is the worst part of the whole sport.
[44:32.25]Alright, so the wind is going... cutting this way a little bit.
[44:37.33]We're gonna drive it over here.
[44:38.55]That should give us a little bit of... uh, leeway, I think.
[44:44.65]It's more fun with people.
[44:45.67]That makes sense.
[44:48.66]That makes sense.
[44:53.55]Although, is it though?
[44:56.05]I kind of feel like after you push your friend for the first time, and then you all laugh, eventually you all just start to be like, so can we like skip this part?
[45:06.77]I guess the part where everybody holds down start, and it's like, oh, player four wants to skip.
[45:11.09]And everyone else just presses start.
[45:12.37]It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:13.69]Alright, so I want to go like here.
[45:23.02]That was way too far.
[45:28.64]What was it?
[45:30.08]Ooh, that was a good approach.
[45:33.17]Alright, this is a birdie putt.
[45:38.29]Don't fuck it up.
[45:54.18]Don't look at wind for putt.
[45:58.84]Stop acting like you know anything about golf.
[46:00.46]Guys, I went to golf camp.
[46:03.56]One day.
[46:04.74]And I left.
[46:05.26]That's a real story.
[46:13.79]In fact, I would think that some of you did the same thing.
[46:24.24]How many of you guys went to golf camp for like a day or two?
[46:27.47]And then were like, eh, nevermind, this isn't for me.
[46:31.31]I kinda feel like that's happened to more than a few of us.
[46:40.03]It may have been like, uh, uh, maybe, I don't know.
[46:43.17]You know when like, your kids are getting to the age where they're old enough to like hold a baseball bat or like hold a golf club?
[46:49.70]And it's like, ah, maybe, hey, hey son!
[46:54.53]What do you think about golf?
[46:56.67]Um, I don't know.
[46:57.45]Well, we'll get you into golf camp and see how it works.
[46:59.49]We'll see how it is for you.
[47:01.54]We'll get you into baseball camp.
[47:08.80]And it's like, oh, that sounds kind of fun.
[47:10.70]Oh, it does.
[47:11.58]It sounds fun, doesn't it, young son?
[47:13.76]Of course it does.
[47:15.59]That kind of sounds fun.
[47:16.41]I hit the ball with the thing.
[47:18.03]Yeah, you hit the ball with the thing.
[47:19.47]Oh, my boys are going to grow up and we're going to be on the back nine together.
[47:21.81]Sorry, Dad.
[47:38.98]Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:40.26]It's not... I didn't go, like, to a camp where I, like, slept over or something for, like, a summer.
[47:47.57]It's not like, oh, yeah, I went to camp.
[47:50.33]And it was, like, a four-week golf camp where I stayed over somewhere.
[47:54.41]No.
[48:04.23]Can I go over here?
[48:04.69]That sounds like a crappy 90s movie.
[48:14.17]Let's go.
[48:14.57]Qualifying round.
[48:15.31]You'll be golfing with two other players and there's a time limit for- Wait, am I actually playing with people?
[48:25.71]I'm gonna play all nine holes.
[48:30.81]Okay.
[48:32.30]Oh shit.
[48:41.30]Alright.
[48:41.60]I'm ready.
[48:42.72]Okay, finished.
[48:48.96]We're doing nine holes?
[48:50.06]That's so long.
[48:51.84]You know how I would actually enjoy golf?
[48:56.41]If an entire game wasn't 18 holes.
[49:00.39]People complain about how long it takes to play a game of baseball.
[49:04.71]Playing an entire 18, nine holes, whatever, golf takes like an entire, it takes like two days.
[49:16.03]Oh shit.
[49:16.65]Oh, how do I punch?
[49:20.71]Come here!
[49:30.62]Why am I so slower?
[49:31.80]Can I, like, stand in front of it?
[49:38.34]Wait, this is actually really dangerous!
[49:41.89]Uh, Yoshi, don't swing.
[49:44.27]Jesus!
[49:46.27]My God, that doesn't teach kids anything good.
[49:48.29]That's teaching kids terrible golf etiquette.
[49:51.46]What?
[49:51.76]Is it hearts?
[50:02.36]What are the hearts for?
[50:16.17]Where's my ball?
[50:17.09]Over here.
[50:18.69]We only have a minute to do this?
[50:20.63]Oh, I'm gonna drain this.
[50:21.79]Check this out.
[50:22.93]Oh!
[50:23.03]Get out of the way!
[50:36.00]You're breathing on me.
[50:36.76]Alright.
[50:39.44]Pink Yoshi fucked up big time.
[50:49.03]Alright, that was fun.
[50:53.63]You gotta be the first to drive.
[50:54.60]170 yards.
[50:56.70]Perfect.
[50:57.02]Wait, there's animals?
[51:02.32]Get away from me!
[51:18.83]Oh, I needed that.
[51:19.47]Get outta here.
[51:28.87]Can I block it?
[51:31.41]Holy shit, Toad, you're awful.
[51:34.81]Okay, how far is it?
[51:36.61]It's at 30 feet.
[51:38.59]We're a little bit up the hill here.
[51:39.81]We're gonna curve it.
[51:40.49]I'm gonna smash it this way.
[51:41.51]Let's go.
[51:41.79]That's in, that's in, that's in.
[51:45.96]That's in!
[51:46.22]Get out of the way!
[51:47.60]What?
[51:52.77]It's alright.
[51:53.59]I did better than them.
[52:04.01]Ready?
[52:07.44]That's a bad idea.
[52:16.84]Oh, I thought I could just clothesline both of them right there.
[52:24.48]What are the coins for?
[52:30.54]Wait, did I just drift?
[52:33.85]What was that?
[52:34.31]Okay, they're not even close to as powerful as I am.
[52:39.21]They're not even close to as powerful as I am.
[52:45.97]Oh, you guys are going that way, huh?
[52:49.48]Oh, actually.
[52:50.76]Yeah, good idea.
[52:57.56]You need to attack them.
[52:58.48]Kill them.
[52:58.80]I can't hurt them.
[53:04.60]Still better.
[53:05.06]You can exchange the coins.
[53:11.17]Does speed even matter?
[53:15.27]I don't know.
[53:16.41]Why do I have to go so fast?
[53:17.95]I have a minute.
[53:19.45]That's not a ton of time, but... Alright, 130 yards.
[53:31.85]Through the tree, that's good.
[53:40.08]Alright, I'm gonna probably chip this in.
[53:43.52]What do we got?
[53:44.26]It's 33 yards.
[53:45.24]Go in.
[53:45.62]Okay.
[53:47.34]In there, curve in there.
[53:53.41]Come on!
[53:57.41]Alright, how's this looking?
[54:00.03]I got a minute and a half to do this.
[54:03.92]I want to go like here.
[54:07.49]It's a little hard, but I think it'll go.
[54:11.17]I need to grab him by the neck?
[54:16.36]Be running, sprinting behind him, grab the caddy of clubs, and just pull it as hard as you can so they go down.
[54:29.70]Can you imagine if they added like a melee attack?
[54:32.17]With just a golf club, just left, right, left, right, left, right, swinging.
[54:36.05]I want the coins.
[55:01.12]Come on, go!
[55:16.69]Oh!
[55:23.88]Yay!
[55:24.74]Gabi J!
[55:32.81]Did I just knock his ball away?
[55:34.87]Wait, I think I just did.
[55:47.86]Holy shit, he almost got it in.
[55:49.86]This is going downhill, right?
[55:56.14]Ugh!
[55:58.34]Is Yoshi taking a shit in the hole?
[56:00.18]What was that?
[56:01.99]Yoshi was just squatting down in front of the hole.
[56:04.59]Come on, Toad.
[56:12.29]You can do it.
[56:17.72]That was so depressing.
[56:22.68]That was so depressing.
[56:28.62]Okay.
[56:33.35]No, I can't for the joke.
[56:35.21]I can't.
[56:36.60]I'm in the lead right now.
[56:37.64]Leave me alone.
[56:38.16]Stop.
[56:55.84]No, I wanted that.
[56:56.84]Okay, do you know how this would actually be fun?
[57:00.56]Uh, if it was like 50 person multiplayer.
[57:08.33]And you could- there was collision on all balls.
[57:10.47]I should've picked up the driver.
[57:28.49]Eight?
[57:29.49]That's still kind of a lot.
[57:34.25]Yeah, I'm drifting behind Toad.
[57:36.30]That's why that just happened.
[57:37.06]Alright, this is gonna be a difficult approach.
[57:41.20]Here we go.
[57:41.60]We're on an incline.
[57:43.06]I gotta tilt it a little bit this way, and I'm gonna curve it a little bit that way.
[57:53.07]That's in the hole.
[57:54.55]That's in the fucking hole.
[57:56.24]Oh my god, it's not in the hole.
[57:57.52]It was almost in the hole.
[58:06.42]Oh no, Toad.
[58:15.94]Toad just looks like a little kid.
[58:17.26]Don't worry, Toad.
[58:23.91]You're only in last place.
[58:29.02]I'm in the lead.
[58:29.50]I just gotta keep it up.
[58:36.42]Mom said you have to bring Toad.
[58:39.14]Alright, where's the wind?
[58:40.71]Wind is going nine miles... I'm not... Let these idiots fucking swing immediately.
[58:44.87]I'm gonna hold them on.
[58:46.37]Okay, so wind is going that way.
[58:47.69]I'm gonna drive it into the wind a little bit, like this way.
[58:51.65]It's not too much wind, but it's enough.
[58:54.26]Here we go.
[59:02.28]That's going in.
[59:04.37]Thank you.
[59:07.75]Oh, fuck.
[59:08.09]I gotta run.
[59:13.49]I'm on the green.
[59:16.09]These guys have a full stroke.
[59:18.60]If I sink this putt, I win the game.
[59:20.78]This is the solidify the game putt.
[59:27.20]This is one of those putts where the guy walks around for 40 minutes.
[59:29.96]Alright, so... This is uphill.
[59:34.48]Okay, we're going this way.
[59:39.17]It's hard to tell where the hill is.
[59:40.11]Okay.
[59:48.43]How strong is that pole going this way, I wonder?
[59:50.71]This is 100 feet.
[59:59.43]I think this is good.
[60:00.73]Let's try it.
[60:08.76]It was more.
[60:09.88]Even more to the right.
[60:18.14]They had way more strokes.
[60:23.33]I'm just slowly chipping away.
[60:28.23]Toad wants to play Angry Birds on your iPad.
[60:30.87]Make sure it doesn't get the screen all sticky again.
[60:35.11]I will tell you, that was one of the most, that was one of the worst things ever.
[60:37.91]Uh, except being an uncle, right?
[60:42.77]I have lots of, uh, nieces and nephews.
[60:45.77]And anytime it was like, oh, like, can I play with your phone?
[60:52.75]No, you're gonna touch it You're gonna like touch it and put your fingers all over it and like you're gonna open up like an app I haven't opened in like a year You're going to Apple up you're gonna open up like Apple home You know what I mean?
[61:09.04]I don't I've never opened that I don't want to give it to you There's a wind
[61:29.80]And it's like never the same.
[61:31.03]You have to like really like wash it and rinse it.
[61:33.77]Bunker?
[61:34.17]I got hit into a bunker?
[61:36.87]Still closer than they are.
[61:46.94]Oh shit.
[61:49.80]Um...
[62:01.09]Get out of the way.
[62:02.59]Get out of the way, you little puke.
[62:08.84]Hates kids, hates iPhone, plays golf.
[62:14.56]What, that makes me an old person?
[62:16.74]Wait, hates kids, has an iPhone, and plays golf.
[62:23.46]This one's kind of scary.
[62:30.43]I have a huge advantage here.
[62:33.09]This is just straight drives forward.
[62:47.45]Oh, you don't like it that I'm drifting over there, do you?
[62:56.30]Where's my ball?
[62:57.18]Oh, there it is.
[63:01.16]Right there.
[63:01.58]Oh, I want the driver, not the three wood.
[63:07.78]What are you talking about?
[63:09.04]Put that away.
[63:09.56]Why would he need the three wood?
[63:14.70]Just drive it again.
[63:15.32]How come he knows the name?
[63:24.93]It said it on the screen.
[63:27.15]Okay.
[63:28.59]This is... I can't tell if that's a hill or not.
[63:32.44]There's the wind.
[63:32.86]Alright, wind.
[63:33.64]I got to hit it a little harder.
[63:41.84]Sink it.
[63:42.82]Sink it.
[63:44.52]Oh, I got it.
[63:48.70]Oh, be careful, Toad.
[63:49.98]It's a tricky course.
[64:10.04]Alright, now I'm really ahead.
[64:14.85]Okay, drive, drive.
[64:16.33]I don't want to take the 3-wood out.
[64:22.09]Why does he hate Toad so much?
[64:23.23]I mean, don't blame me.
[64:32.08]Why are you blaming me for this?
[64:33.22]Blame Nintendo.
[64:35.20]Putting him in last place in every game if he's an AI-controlled character.
[64:40.66]I didn't do that.
[64:49.89]Give me the driving wedge.
[64:51.71]There it is.
[64:53.19]Bang.
[64:57.45]Uh-oh.
[65:01.95]Where'd that go?
[65:07.51]It's alright.
[65:08.21]I'm in a good position to drive it over the lake.
[65:14.03]Alright, I gotta... This is gonna slice, isn't it?
[65:16.79]Oh shit, it's gonna slice.
[65:24.16]Oh fuck, that's really slicing.
[65:26.06]Where's it going?
[65:29.34]Where is it?
[65:29.72]Is it on the green?
[65:30.92]Can I go in this?
[65:37.75]What happened?
[65:38.13]Is that a stroke?
[65:41.67]Oh fuck.
[65:44.21]I'm gonna remember that.
[65:44.99]Alright, let's see.
[65:53.36]I'm gonna go... They're plus three already, these guys.
[65:55.90]How are you plus three already?
[65:57.34]There's still, like, how many holes left?
[66:07.70]Dipping it again.
[66:18.82]What just happened?
[66:23.60]Did I just hit his ball in?
[66:24.96]The green is wet.
[66:28.53]Oh.
[66:29.93]Oh, level up, level up, level up, level up.
[66:49.50]I did it!
[66:51.92]Great work, and just in time.
[66:58.09]Bonny Green's Open Tee is off tomorrow, and after that result, you're all eligible to enter.
[67:02.03]Now it's a two-day tourney.
[67:05.59]The first day is an elimination round.
[67:07.05]If you're still in the next day, you'll have a chance to earn a Chrome Badge, but only if you finish in the top three.
[67:17.28]Oh yeah, this one's in the bag.
[67:18.34]Just hand the trophy over.
[67:20.71]Well, I may not hit shots like Chuck, but I'm confident in my strategy.
[67:26.37]Bold words, but you're both looking past me as if I'm not even here.
[67:31.18]I suppose I'm a ghost.
[67:32.08]Yeah, this is only four players.
[67:33.40]A four-player tournament?
[67:44.42]I'm going to laugh if I'm more powerful than Charger and Chuck, whatever his name is.
[67:55.31]Okay.
[67:59.31]If this won a chance, you might be in for a surprise tomorrow.
[68:02.19]And besides, who says you're the favorites?
[68:04.71]I heard some top players might be making an appearance, like potentially Super Mario.
[68:10.02]Super Mario could be there.
[68:13.16]Okay.
[68:20.33]Hammer Brother, I have a question.
[68:21.75]Why are you allowing Smurfs
[68:26.31]Mario and Luigi being allowed in this tournament is not fair.
[68:35.30]Okay, let's go.
[68:37.66]We do things differently here.
[68:38.80]The higher your rank, the fewer clubs you can carry.
[68:41.16]Trust me, it works out.
[68:42.63]I only need one club.
[68:45.51]But that sounds tough for folks who don't crush the driver like I do.
[68:48.57]You and me are going to get along.
[69:05.03]Everybody go to bed.
[69:07.55]A lot of townspeople to talk to, but I'm not going to talk to any of them.
[69:19.44]You know that jump that I had in the game?
[69:22.86]They took it from me.
[69:30.96]No, no, no, no, I don't wanna- leave me alone.
[69:39.06]This is a cute little town.
[69:41.72]It's a golf camp.
[69:42.57]Is there a sprint?
[69:55.77]Mario slaughters these people.
[69:58.30]Isn't this kind of weird?
[70:03.64]Like, oh, we're at the fun golf camp.
[70:06.54]Golf town with all the Koopas and Goombas.
[70:08.82]Like, Mario kills these people on a regular basis all the time.
[70:21.35]Mario's just an actor.
[70:22.23]Are they all just actors?
[70:26.91]Movies and TV shows aren't real?
[70:28.39]What?
[70:37.88]He's playing- He's an actor.
[70:38.97]He's playing golf with other actors.
[70:43.97]They're actors in the story.
[70:45.95]Are they actually actors?
[70:49.64]Wait, what?
[70:50.98]How have I not known this?
[70:54.82]The world of Super Mario is actors pretending to play fight each other.
[71:02.61]They do that in Mario 3.
[71:06.79]But I mean, that's... Mario 3 was one game.
[71:09.87]Is that how it's supposed to be the whole entire franchise?
[71:30.24]That's why there are curtains in the beginning of 3.
[71:49.14]Platforms in 3 are props.
[71:52.79]I mean, I understand that one game can be, but is it... Like Mario Odyssey, for instance, is all just supposed to be like a movie?
[71:59.79]Like they're actors?
[72:07.42]It's just in one game, yeah.
[72:22.88]It's like the Truman Show.
[72:23.78]Mario doesn't know.
[72:24.78]That would be really weird.
[72:29.14]What a shot from Koopa Troopa.
[72:30.52]I think we're in for some great scores today with the way the course is playing.
[72:33.66]Wait a minute.
[72:36.88]Lakitu following Mario around with the camera.
[72:41.03]Makes a hell of a lot more sense now.
[72:42.79]He's just filming him for the fucking TV show.
[72:51.15]What?
[72:59.30]It's kind of ruining everything.
[73:00.38]Alright, here we go.
[73:05.50]Hole one.
[73:12.96]Drive the ball 200 yards every time.
[73:26.01]How'd you get that special move?
[73:39.52]How is Toad announcing and playing?
[73:47.48]Alright, 166.
[73:48.36]This is uphill.
[73:49.42]We're gonna have to go... Wind is a little bit rough this way.
[73:52.30]Here we go.
[73:55.20]It's on the green.
[74:05.56]They gotta hit it one more time.
[74:06.90]I don't.
[74:10.98]This is a different toad, you asshole.
[74:15.96]Okay, everybody shut up for a second, because this is gonna be hard.
[74:22.88]This one goes downhill, then uphill.
[74:26.34]And it looks like it's pulling this way.
[74:29.51]A tad.
[74:32.67]So I gotta hit it actually pretty hard.
[74:36.57]We're gonna hit it hard.
[74:42.45]That's in!
[74:42.75]That's in!
[74:43.03]That's in!
[74:43.29]That's in!
[74:43.51]That's in!
[74:43.75]That's in!
[74:43.95]That's in!
[74:44.21]That's in!
[74:45.29]Oh, fuck!
[74:46.47]It... Oh, come on!
[74:47.70]Are you serious?
[74:48.68]That would have been awesome.
[74:58.34]I almost curved in.
[74:58.84]Did you address the scandal?
[75:06.50]Well, because I said that I thought Toad was playing... Look, I wasn't paying attention.
[75:10.27]I just see him with a headset on...
[75:14.49]Holy shit, wait a minute.
[75:24.97]That might go in.
[75:25.79]What?
[75:30.56]What happened?
[75:35.10]Oh, no, no.
[75:38.38]Okay, okay, okay.
[75:39.04]It rolled.
[75:39.52]It rolled.
[75:39.88]Alright.
[75:44.97]I gotta drain this.
[75:46.29]I actually have to sink this.
[75:48.59]Slightly, there's a little bit of give here.
[75:51.97]Not very much, but there is.
[75:53.89]This is 15 feet away.
[75:56.27]Just a little bit of give, not that much.
[75:57.67]Oh, there's more!
[76:04.17]There was more give!
[76:05.25]That was blue, it wasn't blue though.
[76:13.95]It's alright, I'm still in third place.
[76:19.80]That Toad had like a blue hat on, and the Toad announcing had a blue hat on, okay?
[76:26.28]Well, he has a suit on, but he had a fucking blue hat on, I swear to God.
[76:39.63]What is that bullshit?
[76:49.57]He's doing- working too job to support his 1 million kids.
[77:01.25]Why are you implying that Toads gotta just dump eggs out somewhere?
[77:21.70]Don't be mad at me because I thought that was the same toad.
[77:23.96]Be mad at the guy that said toads lay a million eggs.
[77:26.81]Alright, that's... I'm the guy you're coming after?
[77:28.61]That's me you're coming after?
[77:30.25]Why?
[77:30.35]Why are you coming after me?
[77:31.89]Alright, 109.
[77:46.66]You said that, though.
[77:47.74]What?
[77:48.34]I didn't say... I was talking about... That guy said a million kids?
[78:01.87]It's from... It's spores.
[78:08.36]Nice, huh?
[78:09.55]Well, how do you get to a million kids if you're not laying like fucking 10,000 eggs every spring?
[78:14.54]Well, whatever the fuck happens in like the world.
[78:17.02]In like the animal kingdom.
[78:19.62]I'm not saying Toad's an animal.
[78:21.60]I'm just saying.
[78:23.44]I'm just saying, like, how do you have a million kids?
[78:27.83]He needs to support his million kids.
[78:29.85]That's like you're dropping 50,000 eggs every spring.
[78:41.11]Mushrooms are fungi.
[78:46.57]How fast does fungi spread a year?
[78:48.05]You don't understand.
[79:01.50]Toad fucks.
[79:21.66]Did I just get hit by a golf club?
[79:23.69]I wasn't looking.
[79:25.01]I wasn't looking.
[79:25.57]I heard a golf swing, and then I heard my character go, Ow!
[79:30.99]Alright, where's the wind?
[79:36.18]This way.
[79:38.52]You guys are fucking crazy.
[79:40.92]Nice shot!
[79:47.17]Everyone's calling me crazy when I'm simply reacting to the person that said that Toad has a million kids.
[79:54.09]And I'm asking... I was just simply asking how that would be possible, even if he was a mushroom.
[80:00.20]Alright, this is heavy, heavy, heavy.
[80:04.64]I gotta go this way hard.
[80:07.18]Is this too much?
[80:10.62]This is very heavy downhill, right?
[80:22.29]That was a one-two.
[80:26.91]I'm in second.
[80:40.93]Toad spreads his spores in a forest, and that's where the babies come from.
[80:45.41]Okay.
[80:46.13]So he lays eggs in the forest.
[80:48.09]I got it.
[80:50.58]Okay, got it.
[80:52.90]Like really?
[80:56.10]Okay, my stomach hurts.
[81:15.66]The amount of people right now that are freaking out about me talking about Toad laying eggs is killing me right now.
[81:25.39]Alright.
[81:30.35]That's way too far.
[81:31.33]Imagine fighting somebody over them saying that Toad lays eggs.
[81:46.94]Oh, this whole conversation is fucking hilarious to me.
[81:54.53]You, I know, I am, I know, it's fucking funny.
[82:05.19]Okay.
[82:07.03]This is gonna curve.
[82:11.94]There it is.
[82:13.72]Get in!
[82:14.54]Come on.
[82:23.67]I'm just imagining two people sitting on a couch, passing a blunt back and forth.
[82:30.91]I don't understand, man.
[82:32.59]How is this possible?
[82:33.45]He has to lay eggs.
[82:37.01]No, no, it's spores.
[82:38.74]He goes to the forest and squats down and spores come out of his ass.
[82:44.40]I don't know, man.
[82:45.02]I don't know how much spore juice does he have in his glands.
[82:48.46]That's too much.
[82:49.68]I think it's eggs.
[82:53.40]The idiocy of the conversation we're having.
[82:58.38]Ready?
[83:07.29]Alright, 166.
[83:08.09]Gonna go right here.
[83:11.21]That's a good on right there.
[83:13.25]Actually gonna be good.
[83:16.17]While eating Taco Bell at 2 a.m.
[83:26.26]Alright, this is a good opportunity to get first place.
[83:32.37]I have to get this putt, though.
[83:35.57]Alright, what do we got?
[83:39.32]50-foot putt.
[83:41.42]Lots of pull this way.
[83:42.72]I'm going here.
[83:43.36]I think it's even more than that.
[83:46.82]I think it's right here.
[83:55.06]Drain it.
[83:55.66]Drain it!
[83:56.04]That was close.
[84:11.63]Minus one.
[84:12.43]Alright, I have to do well here.
[84:13.97]I can't let Charge and Chuck win.
[84:15.19]Nice short game, moron.
[84:23.11]That was actually pretty good.
[84:33.03]Press L to do your special.
[84:35.73]I think my special is just run.
[84:37.01]I don't have one yet.
[84:38.27]Best hope is that Chuck fucks it up.
[84:46.92]Yeah, how come I'm not with Chuck right now?
[84:49.96]I'm not on his squad or whatever this is.
[85:01.21]This is going right to the green.
[85:02.55]What's the wind like?
[85:03.41]We're going to cut it this way a little bit.
[85:06.03]And go.
[85:11.67]I think that's good.
[85:14.32]That looks real good, actually.
[85:15.62]That's going to be close.
[85:21.54]How close, though?
[85:23.34]Enough to sink this?
[85:27.40]Oh, yeah.
[85:28.04]This is doable.
[85:33.46]So, I always have so much trouble in these golf games on how much this actually means.
[85:40.99]That's steep.
[85:45.31]I think right here, I think right here.
[85:47.31]Wind is pushing it this way, though.
[85:53.01]How much does the wind really affect putt when it's downhill like this?
[86:02.98]Wind does affect putt.
[86:08.33]It's because it's going to pull me this way, then levels out a little.
[86:11.09]I'm thinking right air.
[86:11.77]I'm going for it.
[86:15.87]There it is.
[86:17.09]Alright, we're in first place.
[86:18.27]Hide for first with Chuck.
[86:31.10]Not bad.
[86:37.63]Watch out for that tree.
[86:38.49]I don't want to hit that tree.
[86:39.87]Are you gonna play Call of Duty 4?
[86:53.56]No.
[86:59.17]No, I'm not playing Call of Duty 4.
[87:08.06]Get out of the way.
[87:12.09]Alright, this is... Where's the wind?
[87:16.53]I have to overshoot this a little bit because of the wind.
[87:19.39]I'll be on the green.
[87:27.30]Good spot, right?
[87:34.81]Yeah.
[87:35.57]Nice one.
[87:43.80]Alright, this is flat.
[87:45.52]So I should... Nice putt.
[87:49.82]Alright, this is literally just flat.
[87:51.68]There's nothing here.
[87:52.46]It's literally just straight.
[87:55.62]15 feet.
[87:56.64]Right to the hole.
[87:57.72]This is it.
[88:03.37]Got it.
[88:03.59]There's no way that he got a birdie on that hole as well.
[88:10.23]No, he didn't.
[88:10.65]Okay, good.
[88:11.43]First place.
[88:13.27]Alright, I just... I have to get a par here.
[88:15.83]This is it.
[88:17.98]I can't fuck around, I actually have to try hard here.
[88:33.47]The time doesn't matter, just collect the coins.
[88:44.16]Jeremy doesn't get golf.
[88:45.44]Jeremy's in first place.
[88:48.88]Speaking in third person.
[88:49.70]Jeremy, you're not going to get the ice cream later.
[89:03.63]Why do you get to decide when I get to eat ice cream or not?
[89:05.81]Alright, we're going for something hard here.
[89:08.43]Here we go.
[89:09.63]This is ballsy.
[89:10.97]This is ballsy.
[89:23.13]Oh, don't go in the water!
[89:24.23]Alright, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good.
[89:29.76]I bet you like pistachio ice cream.
[89:38.65]Yeah, I do, actually.
[89:39.49]It's phenomenal.
[89:41.13]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[89:42.21]We gotta go... A little bit overshoot it.
[89:46.31]Gonna curve a little bit right here.
[89:47.91]Get it on the green.
[89:52.96]That was solid.
[89:55.17]Could have been better.
[89:58.03]This is flat.
[90:00.35]Alright, this is it.
[90:02.01]I will win the tournament.
[90:04.77]Okay, so this is very gently downhill.
[90:09.03]Or uphill.
[90:12.60]Wind is going this way a little bit.
[90:16.50]I'm thinking right here.
[90:18.50]But look, the hill goes to the right.
[90:20.96]Alright, wait.
[90:21.50]This might not work out the way I want.
[90:28.05]Shit.
[90:28.53]It wasn't even that strong.
[90:29.59]Whatever.
[90:32.31]I still win.
[90:33.87]Yep.
[90:39.17]I win.
[90:45.65]I got first place.
[90:46.13]I'm good.
[90:50.67]How many levels?
[90:51.45]I gotta get at least four or five levels for first place.
[90:57.58]Alright, hold on.
[90:59.30]Stamina, speed, control, spin.
[91:04.70]I mean, I'm thinking this, right?
[91:11.48]I honestly don't give a shit how fast I can run.
[91:13.16]Who cares?
[91:23.77]Control and power.
[91:26.14]That means I can always... My drives will always be right on the mark.
[91:34.87]And then later on, I can worry about how fast I'm running.
[91:36.99]It doesn't really matter.
[91:47.51]By the way, why is it weird to like pistachio ice cream?
[91:49.65]Why is that so weird?
[91:50.49]I thought that was pretty popular.
[92:00.57]It's disgusting?
[92:01.37]It is not.
[92:03.32]I have a bad take for you.
[92:04.36]Pistachio ice cream is delicious.
[92:06.10]Pistachios are gross.
[92:09.64]That's my bad take of the evening for you.
[92:18.11]I don't like pistachios, but I like pistachio ice cream.
[92:29.67]I think it's the added sugar that makes that pistachio flavor become very, very good for me.
[92:42.66]Pistachios are the most amazing thing ever.
[92:47.04]Somebody told me something about pistachios one time, and it freaked me out, and I forget what it was.
[92:54.10]And it would turn me off from eating them forever.
[92:56.42]What was it?
[92:56.92]There's something weird about pistachios.
[92:59.10]Isn't there something weird?
[92:59.94]Is it bugs?
[93:08.78]It's something about them being actually kind of gross.
[93:19.75]You mean figs?
[93:24.04]Oh, it's something weird.
[93:25.30]Something about, like... Let me look this up before I, like, give you a total, complete misinformation campaign here.
[93:31.05]Like, let me get this right.
[93:40.75]What is it?
[93:52.97]Is it a conspiracy?
[93:53.95]I don't think so.
[93:57.21]Why are pistachios, like, bad, right?
[93:59.83]Like, I'm just, I don't remember.
[94:03.24]It was something weird that I was like, no, I don't want to eat those.
[94:08.66]And it was something, like, odd.
[94:10.84]And I looked at it and was like, that's kind of weird.
[94:17.48]Not figs.
[94:17.96]No, figs is the wasp shit.
[94:19.32]I know that.
[94:24.69]Was it clickbait?
[94:25.77]Was it a fake news clickbait title?
[94:27.27]No, no, no, no, no.
[94:28.77]Maybe it was like a... I don't want to say what I thought it was.
[94:33.54]Let me see.
[94:48.53]Oh, I guess they were recalled pistachios at some point.
[94:55.17]Is that what this is?
[94:58.61]This is, like, from a few years ago.
[95:03.83]It caused farts and bloating.
[95:09.36]That's not what this says.
[95:12.64]You probably heard... No, I don't know what that is.
[95:16.68]Yeah, there was, like, something weird, like, four or five years ago.
[95:19.29]Like, whatever it is.
[95:28.35]Cashews are the ones that the fruit is poisonous.
[95:31.65]No, it wasn't cashews.
[95:32.89]It was... Start the final round.
[95:35.61]Oh, fuck.
[95:36.27]I gotta pay attention.
[95:36.89]Cashews are covered in a strong... Maybe that is what it was.
[95:49.13]Is that what it is?
[95:49.69]Did somebody get it?
[95:51.57]Aflatoxins?
[95:52.42]Is that what it was?
[95:59.14]Athlatoxin, a chemical in which can cause cancerous mold, has been found in some mistreated pistachios and led to breakouts of diseases.
[96:06.18]That's- alright, so I wasn't crazy.
[96:08.80]Is that a legit article though?
[96:09.88]Pistachios contain toad spores.
[96:27.11]source dude I told you me you trust me right give us a yeehaw to prove your American citizenship I don't think I could even do a good yeehaw it would probably be embarrassing
[96:59.14]You would think I would not pass your test that you have here.
[97:02.50]Alright, this is the finals.
[97:19.28]I don't know if, like... Like, yee-haw!
[97:23.48]Like that?
[97:26.72]But I feel like to do that, you have to like lean back, put your fist up, and go like... Did I get in the sand?
[97:41.80]Oh shit, I did get in the sand.
[97:43.08]This is bad.
[97:43.60]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[97:49.89]What if I just drive it out of here?
[97:50.95]Can I do it?
[97:53.77]No, that's too risky.
[97:54.53]Too risky.
[98:04.43]stay on the fairway please okay okay where's the wind going get it on the green right here that's safe it should get there oh my god it went in it went oh it didn't go in
[98:32.04]That was close, too.
[98:34.02]Damn, alright.
[98:35.96]That was really close.
[98:42.36]What a recovery that was.
[98:43.26]Still in first place?
[98:54.56]But no, a pistachio flavor I think is okay.
[98:57.56]They kind of work.
[99:10.55]I like pistachio ice cream.
[99:14.13]You know, I'm kind of a weirdo.
[99:15.15]I think I like it because it's green.
[99:23.54]If you handed me vanilla ice cream, and you handed me vanilla ice cream that was tinted a sky blue, or like robin's egg blue, I would like it more.
[99:32.94]I would go, oh, wow, this is awesome.
[99:37.25]My imagination fills in the blanks.
[99:40.44]Alright.
[99:45.02]The wind is going a little bit this way.
[99:46.62]We got to go 366.
[99:50.68]Pull it up a little.
[99:57.39]Robin's egg blue.
[100:03.49]It's on.
[100:05.88]If you like spinach, I need to know.
[100:07.44]Spinach is actually my favorite green vegetable.
[100:11.58]Yes, I do.
[100:12.08]Very much so.
[100:17.53]Okay.
[100:20.83]I got a minute and a half.
[100:21.53]I'm fine.
[100:26.28]So this has got a... I think that's good.
[100:34.91]A little bit more.
[100:35.87]I don't know how to do it.
[100:42.30]Spinach is the best green vegetable.
[100:44.56]You can do tons of stuff with it.
[100:48.54]You can saute it.
[100:52.33]You can mix it up.
[100:55.79]it turns into a different thing.
[100:57.67]You can eat spinach raw, and if you cook it, it turns into this weird, like, kind of wilty, soft, delicious, kind of juicy thing.
[101:05.30]Or you can eat it like salad, like normal.
[101:08.70]It's very versatile.
[101:13.82]I like spinach more than kale.
[101:15.64]Because kale is kind of weird.
[101:19.61]It's got a weird texture.
[101:20.43]You have to chew through it more.
[101:21.95]It's a little stringy.
[101:23.51]Spinach is way better.
[101:33.85]I mean, I think Kayle is probably better for you.
[101:36.67]Pound for pound in nutrient density, whatever, but... Is that really that big of a deal?
[101:43.18]He just turned through that.
[101:48.26]I understand there's like tackling and pushing in this game, but that was like a red card.
[101:51.09]You know?
[101:53.87]Like, where's the referee?
[101:57.75]Kayle's good in smoothies.
[101:58.77]Yeah, Kayle is good when it's juiced.
[102:05.18]I can't go through that tree.
[102:06.78]Yeah, I can.
[102:20.62]Get through the tree.
[102:21.44]Yes!
[102:29.58]Yes, it's actually up there.
[102:31.25]It's actually all the way up there.
[102:43.66]I'm on top of this hill, too.
[102:45.32]This actually is not a bad place to be.
[102:46.86]This is gonna curve.
[103:03.63]Curved in.
[103:07.61]That's pretty good.
[103:08.33]Alright, I saved some time there, I think.
[103:15.91]Where was the skybox for a second?
[103:17.11]I see tearing.
[103:22.40]I think I just go.
[103:23.96]It's not going to be enough to affect the movement.
[103:28.85]All the way down.
[103:29.59]There's a little bit of pull this way.
[103:32.25]I think this is going to be fine.
[103:33.39]It's not going to hit her hard enough.
[103:43.80]Exactly what I was thinking was gonna happen.
[103:45.16]That's exactly why I didn't want to do that hard.
[103:47.74]I didn't want to go that far.
[103:53.99]I just have to get pars.
[103:54.81]That's all that matters.
[103:55.39]I'm two strokes ahead of Chuck.
[103:59.87]Go this way.
[104:15.60]Why am I not getting that?
[104:18.07]Remember, this game sucks.
[104:26.31]But you said sucks in all capitals.
[104:33.36]Remember, this game sucks.
[104:36.02]You were very upset about this.
[104:39.16]I think it's fun.
[104:41.71]What?
[104:45.87]What's your problem with it?
[104:48.37]Okay, how about you tell me what you think about how bad you don't like it, and I'll tell you how bad I think it is.
[105:01.74]Okay.
[105:10.90]It's not actually just messing around the side.
[105:14.00]It's really not a bad game.
[105:16.32]It's really fun.
[105:18.36]I could see how you could just sit here and chill and play golf.
[105:21.80]I get it.
[105:23.04]It's fun.
[105:26.26]This is the awful game to watch.
[105:27.66]Well, golf is awful to watch in general.
[105:30.66]And what is this hill?
[105:32.54]It's going right and left at the same time.
[105:37.20]What am I supposed to do about this?
[105:41.94]Um... I don't know.
[105:44.85]Nothing.
[105:53.11]Yeah, way ahead.
[106:06.05]Golf really is one of those weird games.
[106:09.17]At least in a video game sense.
[106:11.81]I actually really don't mind playing golf in a video game, but I really despise it playing it in real life.
[106:17.13]I truly do.
[106:28.10]But it's kind of the opposite for baseball for me.
[106:32.24]I would rather play a game of baseball in real life than play a video game of it.
[106:36.10]I don't know about just getting the bat and getting up there and swinging.
[106:42.95]On the reverse.
[106:48.25]That's good.
[106:55.65]Well, get out of the way!
[106:59.88]It's not gonna make it.
[107:00.44]I ran away with it though.
[107:10.16]There's no way he comes back.
[107:11.88]I would have to be a moron and get... I'd have to do it intentionally bad as a joke.
[107:25.92]Nice shot!
[107:31.21]Somebody said, Omega Lull, he has negative points.
[107:44.73]I got a P, too.
[107:54.88]Mario Sluggers?
[107:56.04]That was actually really good.
[108:05.21]I think this is a crazy idea.
[108:10.65]It is.
[108:10.89]I want to get on the green.
[108:24.42]You gonna play Mario Strikers?
[108:25.52]I probably will play Mario Strikers.
[108:26.98]I was a huge fan of the one for the Wii.
[108:37.70]Let's chip this shit in.
[108:39.30]That is all day.
[108:56.78]No Elden Ring, please.
[108:58.06]That's probably not going to happen.
[108:59.70]I'm obsessed with Elden Ring right now.
[109:04.96]Somewhere at the halfway point.
[109:05.86]I'm going to take a little bit.
[109:08.00]I'm going to take like 15, 20 minutes.
[109:11.32]This could be a hole-in-one if I can get it.
[109:19.14]That's going to be close.
[109:25.11]That's actually going to be close.
[109:30.11]Nice one.
[109:39.28]Can you do a knitting scream?
[109:41.00]I don't think that would be enjoyable.
[109:42.30]I think you would all hate that.
[109:57.39]Axe out speed and you can tackle them.
[109:58.67]Alright, only two holes left.
[110:05.83]And I have completed my first tournament.
[110:10.90]Are there mini-games?
[110:11.70]I wanna play mini-games.
[110:30.27]I'm so far ahead.
[110:31.71]I can just literally relax, just get the coins and the hearts and stuff.
[110:36.31]What's wrong with the music?
[110:37.49]I don't understand.
[110:38.13]People don't like the music?
[110:42.26]What's the problem with the music?
[110:45.65]Everyone's like, music, turn it off, please.
[110:48.87]Why?
[110:50.11]It's because it's on a five second loop?
[111:09.29]It kind of is.
[111:22.75]I would've had that.
[111:23.57]It is the same song.
[111:28.39]I haven't paid any attention.
[111:30.79]Oh my god, Yoshi, you're plus ten.
[111:53.35]Is Yoshi doing the thing at mini-golf where you're infuriated and you're not having a good time?
[111:59.37]So you just drag the ball three or four times when you get it close enough and you don't care?
[112:07.40]You mess up and you just drag drag drag in and it counts as like four strokes.
[112:13.13]Is that what you're doing right now, Yoshi?
[112:29.84]Just drive it.
[112:31.50]That's where my skills are.
[112:43.91]It actually has been this for an hour.
[112:45.31]How did mine go in the sand?
[112:58.35]What?
[113:00.26]I'm so far ahead, who fucking cares?
[113:01.84]Just drive it.
[113:08.02]There it is!
[113:08.44]Nice one!
[113:32.15]Oh shit, I don't want to hit anybody with this.
[113:38.28]Wait, do I have to go get it?
[113:39.54]I don't have to go get it, right?
[113:42.12]It's out of bounds.
[113:45.08]It's out of bounds.
[113:45.94]I can't get that.
[113:49.18]Okay.
[113:52.60]Jesus.
[113:58.85]Close.
[114:06.15]I win.
[114:07.05]Plus 12.
[114:14.61]I got my first medal.
[114:15.55]The Star Cup!
[114:17.57]How come there's not two other pedestals?
[114:21.23]Only one for first place?
[114:25.80]Thousand coins and probably leveled up like five times.
[114:32.28]Oh yeah.
[114:33.86]Your special dash improved.
[114:36.79]Alright.
[114:39.52]So... Control is fine.
[114:43.20]Spin... I don't really care about that.
[114:45.38]I'll do Stamina.
[114:55.63]Head to Ridge Rock Lake.
[115:07.00]This dude's doing an endurance build.
[115:09.51]Actually, I got to pee real bad.
[115:11.01]But not yet.
[115:13.23]Rise and shine, champ.
[115:27.58]Ooh.
[115:31.84]Alright.
[115:35.95]Alright.
[115:38.50]Please take a pee break.
[115:39.36]Alright, we'll take a pee.
[115:40.14]I've been playing for two hours?
[115:41.92]I feel like... Am I having fun?
[115:47.36]Because that's kind of odd.
[115:49.66]Alright.
[115:50.74]I did not expect to be playing for two hours.
[115:54.78]Alright, I'll be right back.
[115:55.56]I'm going to pee.
[115:55.96]Give me two seconds.
[118:57.47]Thank you.
[120:39.13]Yeah.
[120:41.45]Yeah, what's that?
[120:43.72]I mean, it's alright.
[120:44.32]I'm just... Yeah, I'll be done, like, a little bit later tonight.
[120:51.02]I mean, it's okay.
[120:51.62]It's, like... It's probably, like, a 4 out of 10, though.
[120:56.68]Yeah, if I just keep pretending to like it, like, the fans will, you know, go.
[121:01.50]I just have to keep pretending to like it.
[121:07.42]Even though, like, I fucking hate it.
[121:10.68]Yeah, I'll see you later.
[121:12.97]Oh my god, I just got caught!
[121:16.59]Oh my god, I got caught!
[121:20.87]No!
[121:21.45]No, no, no, no!
[121:22.65]Alright, let's go.
[121:39.57]This is kind of cool.
[121:40.19]There's a map.
[121:45.53]I love the hot mic joke.
[121:47.21]It's the worst fucking joke.
[121:48.52]It really is.
[121:56.12]It's not.
[121:56.84]It's not.
[121:57.44]It's the worst one.
[122:00.76]Ooh, a new area.
[122:02.44]Is that putting practice?
[122:09.43]Congrats on the chrome badge.
[122:12.11]X is bronze.
[122:17.44]Do you check to see if your mic is off?
[122:19.66]I mean, I have a little thing where I turn it off and on.
[122:22.76]It's like a little button I press.
[122:25.42]Sometimes I don't press it.
[122:26.50]Sometimes I'm just like, but I don't really care.
[122:35.78]Big storm.
[122:38.74]Won't be any tournaments for a while.
[122:40.06]What?
[122:44.68]You can't hear anything.
[122:45.54]Yeah, you can.
[122:49.07]Have you ever heard of cross-country golf?
[122:51.85]XC golf, for short.
[122:55.47]Believe it or not, XC golf goes way back.
[122:57.55]It's a form of the game that many of the top players have mastered.
[123:02.80]Some of the really high-level players can still play our course even in this state.
[123:05.94]It's remarkable to see them in action.
[123:09.60]Of course, they can use special shots, so it's not exactly fair.
[123:13.80]Maybe you saw Mario in that televised... I thought he was going to say commercial.
[123:19.94]You've already seen a special shot.
[123:21.63]Some of them are so powerful that they can affect other players and blast their golf balls out of the way.
[123:29.27]Okay.
[123:31.31]Interesting.
[123:37.59]So everybody has a special move.
[123:39.17]I get it.
[123:41.92]Should I just play the regular game mode and just pick a character and just go play?
[123:57.00]That sounds like something interesting.
[124:03.66]Pick seven clubs.
[124:05.52]There's a lot of elevation change.
[124:06.94]The nine iron.
[124:07.72]Okay.
[124:08.62]Let me tell you what I need.
[124:13.70]I need the driver.
[124:14.42]I need six iron.
[124:20.72]Pitching wedge.
[124:25.96]This is changing golf attire.
[124:27.30]Okay.
[124:33.60]Yeah, I don't need more than that.
[124:37.95]Maybe if... I'll take a six iron.
[124:40.79]I'll take the six hybrid.
[124:42.99]Sounds good.
[124:46.31]Successfully downloaded data for Picross.
[124:48.59]Did he really just fucking expose me like that?
[124:52.61]Alright, let's try it.
[125:00.18]No, I don't want to change gear.
[125:07.71]If you find yourself in a really tricky spot, and we all do from time to time, you're not totally out of luck.
[125:16.49]Alright, I'll be fine.
[125:18.15]Play a practice round of XC golf.
[125:27.62]Verifying badge confirmed.
[125:29.04]Registration for XC golf practice round complete.
[125:31.52]Complete three holes and 30 strokes or fewer to advance.
[125:33.56]Okay.
[125:36.55]You may encounter tornadoes on the course.
[125:38.31]This is normal.
[125:39.57]They may be used to... Okay.
[125:41.91]Be careful.
[125:42.35]There are hazards.
[125:50.05]Got some flat lies will fly straight.
[125:52.63]Yeah, that's an uphill will curve Downhill will curve.
[125:57.32]Yeah.
[125:57.66]Yeah.
[125:57.92]Yeah, the moral.
[125:58.86]Yeah.
[125:59.22]Yeah.
[125:59.54]Yeah.
[125:59.72]Alright I'm not gonna play pick Ross right now.
[126:03.16]I'm okay.
[126:03.68]Stop Tornadoes on the course will blow both golfers and golf balls into the sky.
[126:13.56]Oh
[126:17.68]Okay.
[126:23.86]Did I do that?
[126:30.14]Wait, there are two different holes.
[126:34.90]So you have to... Okay.
[126:37.16]Alright, I got an idea.
[126:39.06]Is this stupid?
[126:42.87]Will this go into that wind and go up?
[126:48.81]That didn't do anything.
[126:56.86]I thought it was gonna go in the tornado and go up.
[126:59.50]I guess not.
[126:59.90]Oh, well, okay, never mind.
[127:02.34]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[127:09.30]Huge wind pushing this way, so I'm gonna sit right here.
[127:12.42]Big curve as well.
[127:24.38]Pretty good!
[127:24.88]It said watch out for them, don't go directly into them, but I thought it was gonna make the ball bounce up.
[127:35.52]That's a- that's steep.
[127:37.36]I think that's the one right there.
[127:42.11]Ah, again, I keep messing that up.
[127:44.69]This is the worst stream, it's not Picross.
[127:46.29]I'm not playing Picross, stop asking for it or I'm gonna be very upset with you!
[127:56.04]So now we go again.
[127:56.64]Oh, okay.
[127:58.70]This is actually cool.
[128:00.36]I do genuinely like this.
[128:05.98]Is it going to hit the wall?
[128:10.95]Oh!
[128:11.83]It does work.
[128:12.45]So why didn't it work last time?
[128:21.68]Alright.
[128:21.96]This is downhill a little bit.
[128:24.30]Big wind.
[128:33.48]I'm not playing Picross.
[128:34.56]I'm not playing Picross.
[128:39.96]No.
[128:41.25]No.
[128:42.27]I'll play Picross later.
[128:45.45]This is going to be like a 10-hour stream where you guys just buckle up.
[128:50.45]Oh, no.
[128:54.32]I did this completely wrong.
[128:55.34]There's the wind.
[129:02.12]Okay, tornado this way.
[129:09.14]I should go into that tornado and go up?
[129:13.92]Please make it.
[129:14.39]Alright, I'm fine.
[129:19.59]I'm not gonna play Picross for like four hours.
[129:21.75]Oh, I gotta go across the whole fucking game again.
[129:27.17]God damn it.
[129:39.94]I'll play a few rounds of Picross no later than at least 45 minutes from right now.
[129:50.07]Okay, will that actually go up?
[129:53.21]Will that travel up in the tornado?
[129:54.85]I hope so.
[129:58.81]That's why I'm doing it.
[130:00.21]Watch out!
[130:11.33]We were kidding, don't.
[130:12.28]That's what I'm saying, I know.
[130:14.84]You guys are such fucking jokers.
[130:16.30]He's not even gonna get on the green.
[130:21.34]What an idiot.
[130:22.82]17 strokes left, oh no.
[130:44.28]I knew this was going to happen.
[130:49.10]I knew it was going to happen.
[130:57.91]44 minutes until Picross?
[130:59.19]Maybe.
[130:59.45]Alright, let's do it for real.
[131:02.97]I was tracking my every move.
[131:11.18]Let's do it.
[131:12.56]Let's register for a standard XC golf tournament.
[131:18.88]That was actually pretty cool.
[131:19.68]Because you can approach that a bunch of different ways.
[131:27.98]Let's go.
[131:38.06]Use your coins?
[131:40.84]How do I use my coins?
[131:45.42]How to play?
[131:46.34]No.
[131:48.24]Who sells shit here?
[131:49.12]Does somebody sell something?
[131:53.68]Who is the shopkeeper?
[131:56.16]Over here?
[131:58.86]Ooh.
[132:00.04]Okay.
[132:02.53]Welcome.
[132:02.83]Anything you want to buy?
[132:06.63]Bullet bill for hybrid.
[132:14.77]Where's the... Where is it?
[132:18.74]Hold on.
[132:34.95]I don't think... Is this it?
[132:42.03]Let me just see if this is it.
[132:49.72]Now, where is this commercial for this fucking driver?
[132:52.03]I don't know.
[132:56.83]Boomerang.
[133:01.09]Ooh.
[133:03.87]These are good.
[133:05.55]I want those.
[133:15.31]Okay.
[133:16.21]So then... Piranha Plant?
[133:19.09]Makes it easier to control shots out of deep, roughened mud.
[133:21.45]I kind of want the Bullet Bill Hybrid.
[133:30.22]I mean, why wouldn't I use that?
[133:35.80]Elevation Finder?
[133:37.52]Yeah.
[133:38.84]Okay.
[133:43.54]What do you sell?
[133:50.84]Alright, let me put that stuff on.
[133:59.30]Okay.
[134:03.31]Alright, I think we're good.
[134:03.93]I thought there were no golf carts.
[134:19.19]You are clear for three holes of standard XC golf.
[134:21.97]Progress in any order.
[134:23.31]Complete the required holes in 30 strokes.
[134:28.71]Wait, there's a shot clock now?
[134:29.77]I know how a spin shot works.
[134:45.48]Can you die in this?
[134:49.13]I'm... no.
[134:50.49]You can't.
[134:53.79]You have two minutes to hit and reach your ball before you be assessed a stroke penalty?
[135:00.22]Okay.
[135:01.50]That doesn't seem that big of a deal.
[135:04.36]At least not yet.
[135:05.96]Not initially.
[135:19.99]This game is a unity asset swap.
[135:24.90]I think it's a little better.
[135:25.96]That's better than that.
[135:26.76]What do the coins do?
[135:33.28]I just purchased a few things.
[135:34.75]You can buy upgrades.
[135:38.13]And that guy's going to hit me, isn't he?
[135:54.84]What?
[135:55.12]Alright, watch it.
[135:57.56]We got high wind.
[136:01.89]Oh, I thought that was the pitching wedge.
[136:03.27]I didn't think that was a putter.
[136:14.86]I thought I had the pitching wedge on.
[136:16.36]Why do I sound like that?
[136:22.72]I'm going straight on.
[136:23.68]I'm just going to hit it as hard as I can.
[136:25.00]Shit.
[136:32.30]Sorry.
[136:33.68]That'll go in.
[136:35.50]How do I get up there?
[136:40.25]What is it doing?
[136:41.71]What?
[136:45.27]What are you talking about?
[136:46.15]What?
[136:52.64]Didn't go in the... Didn't go in the thing here.
[136:56.67]How am I supposed to handle this?
[137:23.70]Alright, I made it up there.
[137:29.80]Where is it?
[137:30.16]Alright, I made it.
[137:32.98]Yep.
[137:34.66]Now I use it.
[137:35.22]I'm good.
[137:40.84]Now this is downhill.
[137:47.62]Heavy winds.
[138:06.67]I'm so bad at putting.
[138:11.75]It's fine.
[138:12.75]I have 19 strokes left.
[138:19.01]Oh my god.
[138:19.74]I went the wrong way again.
[138:42.01]Now I understand where the stamina comes from.
[138:43.58]I didn't think it was going to be this important.
[138:53.78]Is this game open world?
[138:54.82]It is not.
[138:56.62]This is just kind of a cool game mode where you have to sink in three different holes in a certain amount of strokes, which I'll give him credit.
[139:07.25]It's time to give the Super Nintendo developer some credit.
[139:11.57]That's cool.
[139:12.39]That's a cool spin on golf.
[139:14.15]It just increased the letter grade.
[139:17.19]But here's the problem.
[139:18.49]How do I... Alright.
[139:22.55]I'm going to go nine iron.
[139:23.39]Can I do nine iron?
[139:26.80]Six iron might do it.
[139:30.50]Nine iron might just barely get over the hill.
[139:32.78]I'm going for it.
[140:02.92]I gotta get it up there.
[140:04.72]Ah, shit.
[140:08.18]Um, okay.
[140:12.54]Wait, it did go up.
[140:13.38]Wait, what?
[140:14.60]What happened?
[140:16.70]I've lost my mind.
[140:17.16]I don't know what's going on.
[140:25.91]Is that bad?
[140:30.85]Wait, how hard did I just hit that?
[140:32.05]It's right here.
[140:38.72]Alright, we're good.
[140:44.96]I did this completely wrong, but whatever.
[140:52.23]Whoa, I can break those.
[140:53.37]This guy's pretty good.
[140:58.71]This is gonna slice like crazy, so I'm gonna hit it this way.
[141:12.37]Why was that not even a slice?
[141:14.79]The game just told me, oh my god, dude, you're fucked.
[141:24.45]Thinking.
[141:26.51]In.
[141:29.58]Please do the let's freaking go voice.
[141:31.10]Maybe I will in a minute.
[141:40.61]That was fun.
[141:41.11]I like this.
[141:41.47]I'm not moving yet.
[141:46.41]Please do it.
[141:52.67]That was solid.
[141:53.37]Seems like you're figuring out XC golf.
[141:55.46]I think you'd do well in a competition.
[141:59.14]We're making good progress on course repairs, so we should be ready to host some kind of a competition soon.
[142:02.90]Play a standard round of XC golf.
[142:08.14]Alright, let's do it.
[142:14.36]The next stream should be you going golfing.
[142:16.36]The next big stream.
[142:18.25]I would just slice the ball.
[142:20.73]We'd do a big thing where I elaborately, oh, I'm going to do nine holes of golf.
[142:24.97]I'd get up there, I'd tee up, and I would slice the ball so bad that I'd lose the ball and get frustrated and probably stop streaming.
[142:32.05]Golf infuriates me.
[142:42.78]I need to do six holes in 35 strokes.
[142:45.64]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[142:47.92]This actually is where the game begins.
[142:56.51]Ready?
[142:58.23]Alright, there are six.
[143:00.25]We gotta go this way first.
[143:01.37]Go!
[143:02.69]That was like in my ear.
[143:03.53]That was weird.
[143:05.57]Alright, we gotta go this way.
[143:08.87]Is this gonna make it?
[143:16.89]Well, this is going to bounce right off the edge, isn't it?
[143:19.79]Might not.
[143:20.13]This is going to bounce right off the... Why would I not be more concerned about the tree that's there and not the rock?
[143:40.67]Now I have to sand wedge it up there.
[143:48.82]Can I sand wedge it up?
[143:51.36]Please?
[143:53.88]Come on.
[143:55.07]Sand wedge.
[144:03.57]Yes!
[144:03.85]Alright, how do I get up there?
[144:08.24]Um... Okay, we're good.
[144:21.07]Is this up on another ledge?
[144:22.25]Alright, another sandwich.
[144:26.97]I'm not far enough.
[144:31.51]Wait.
[144:32.77]Where was I going to end up?
[144:33.93]Okay.
[144:35.31]So if I do... Six iron.
[144:39.13]At about 50%.
[144:40.31]I'm going to say 50% speed.
[144:42.19]It's going to slice a little.
[144:45.19]I'm going to do nine iron.
[144:48.54]We're going to do a nine iron straight on.
[144:57.69]Yep.
[145:00.79]Yep, alright, nice.
[145:06.46]Were you thinking of the hammer driver infomercial?
[145:08.94]I don't know.
[145:09.66]It's like from like 1998 or something.
[145:14.84]I don't know what it is.
[145:16.80]But that shit, you can't, that shit's illegal.
[145:21.10]Okay.
[145:23.90]Where is this thing?
[145:24.70]Over here.
[145:26.14]Alright, we're almost there.
[145:27.06]I'm gonna drive it here.
[145:30.00]It's gonna curve a little.
[145:35.86]This next part shouldn't be too bad.
[145:42.25]God damn it.
[145:43.87]This one sucks to get to.
[145:44.95]I have 30 strokes left, I'm okay.
[145:54.21]Okay.
[146:00.79]Right before the putt.
[146:04.77]Why is he talking like he's fighting an Elden Ring boss?
[146:06.83]Because that's the only thing I've done for two straight weeks.
[146:18.24]Get the putter out.
[146:24.50]Can't tell.
[146:31.49]I had to hit it way harder because it was in the fucking rough... whatever.
[146:38.27]Alright, 28 strokes.
[146:38.87]We need five more holes.
[146:39.69]They're all over there.
[146:44.73]Um... I'm gonna say we're gonna go the one all the way to the right.
[146:51.17]Look how far apart these are!
[146:59.01]These things are so far away.
[147:16.53]What?
[147:22.97]Alright, move.
[147:30.70]Straight again.
[147:31.34]Oh my god.
[147:33.38]Can I actually make that?
[147:34.40]I wonder.
[147:38.83]Oh, that's what those fucking idiots did.
[147:45.75]Get over here.
[147:47.71]Alright, change plan.
[147:55.27]I gotta go this one.
[148:03.90]What the heck is this, dude?
[148:06.18]I'm playing Mario Golf!
[148:09.78]This is just to game my Twitch analytics.
[148:17.17]So my whole directory is not Elden Ring.
[148:31.11]There's got to be at least three hours of Mario Golf.
[148:33.32]So it will fit into the algorithm of like other games that I've played in the last month.
[148:37.32]That's good.
[148:53.64]And Pic... Oh, yeah.
[148:54.43]And Picross will be there, too.
[148:55.61]That's right.
[148:57.19]You got a good point.
[149:04.75]Okay.
[149:06.58]This is still very possible, because I need...
[149:11.71]I have to go this way now.
[149:12.67]We're gonna go this way, we're gonna go over to the right, and then I'm gonna come down into the middle again.
[149:17.30]Should be alright.
[149:18.78]What's the wind like?
[149:19.48]Alright, wind is blowing a lot this way.
[149:21.16]I'm gonna go a little bit short.
[149:24.69]Right there.
[149:25.11]Watch out for the tree.
[149:28.15]Oh.
[149:43.30]30 more minutes to meet the Mario Golf quota.
[149:48.83]I mean, it's not... This isn't a bounty or anything.
[149:51.57]Wait, did I do that?
[150:05.23]Did I fuck up the tree?
[150:17.89]Oh, this is gonna slice like crazy.
[150:19.41]Okay, 38 yards.
[150:30.26]Oh, there's a lot of wind too, though.
[150:31.66]Okay, don't mess this up.
[150:36.44]It's very, very, very steep.
[150:39.76]And I have to hit it not that hard.
[150:43.06]Right there.
[150:44.02]Right here.
[150:50.06]Perfect.
[150:51.22]God fucking damn it.
[150:52.34]I'll never get it.
[151:00.99]What the fuck?
[151:01.79]What?
[151:02.27]I was trying to skip through the... Where is it going?
[151:05.33]No.
[151:08.81]Well that's not good I was trying to skip the dialog sequence This is really uphill though Will this make it?
[151:34.22]Oh, I did.
[151:34.68]I got it.
[151:41.40]OK, same thing here.
[151:42.58]Fuck.
[151:49.70]That's not going to work.
[152:03.84]Oh, this is bad.
[152:12.11]I have to tornado it, but I can't.
[152:15.67]I have 16 strokes left.
[152:16.87]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[152:19.38]I need to... How am I going to do this?
[152:35.62]A hundred feet, I gotta go, like... That didn't do anything!
[152:53.05]Okay, alright, alright!
[152:53.93]That's it, I got it.
[152:56.49]No, it's over.
[152:56.99]This is ruined.
[152:57.63]How are you supposed to reliably get up there?
[153:06.88]Yeah, this is, this is ruined.
[153:08.02]I have to, it's got to go like over here.
[153:14.19]Wait.
[153:15.59]Alright, that's good.
[153:18.67]That's not what I want to do.
[153:28.85]I mean, I'm screwed either way, honestly.
[153:31.85]So does it really matter?
[153:36.00]Why does it keep zooming out so far?
[153:37.20]Like, what are you doing?
[153:39.36]What's with this shit view?
[153:43.64]What is with this terrible fucking camera?
[153:55.65]Will this get picked up by the thing?
[153:56.95]I hope so.
[154:01.50]Yep, there it is.
[154:02.00]Okay.
[154:02.10]I don't think I'm going to have enough strokes to do it.
[154:07.92]Oh my god, it's still not even close.
[154:13.62]Wait, what?
[154:17.72]Where's the ball?
[154:34.89]What is going on?
[154:35.97]Why does it say it's down?
[154:42.49]Why is the ball down here?
[154:45.33]Did it go out of bounds?
[154:48.92]I'm very confused.
[154:54.04]What happened?
[154:59.28]There was a penalty?
[155:10.79]It's got to go right through the middle.
[155:16.35]It's grayed out over there.
[155:17.40]Alright, well this obviously- Just restart the whole fucking thing.
[155:21.54]Restart, restart.
[155:22.30]This is stupid.
[155:23.66]Restart!
[155:30.51]I forgot Nintendo does the thing where- Remember, I told you.
[155:34.05]I want a fucking- I want a- I want Congress to pass a law.
[155:39.77]A is B and B is A across all these different consoles.
[155:45.07]Nintendo wants you to press the right button to accept stuff.
[155:49.17]Xbox says, no, bro, hit the bottom button.
[155:54.24]We didn't get Congress involved.
[155:57.28]Ready?
[156:07.39]Go!
[156:09.61]Alright, straight ahead.
[156:20.75]This dude's high on wallpaper glue.
[156:31.92]You don't understand.
[156:35.48]The president has to get involved.
[156:37.30]A is B and B is A across Nintendo and Xbox.
[156:41.31]You don't understand.
[156:42.17]It's really pissing me off.
[156:50.65]Don't.
[156:50.95]Okay.
[156:56.69]They should have all come to an agreement a long time ago.
[156:58.87]Nice.
[157:00.31]Okay, is it wrong for me to say that if your controller is X, Y, B, A, and the competitor's controller is X, Y, B, A, just come to a fucking agreement and shake hands in an office somewhere and be like, look, we're going to have the same button with commands, right?
[157:16.64]Like, we're going to.
[157:17.18]See, PlayStation gets to fuck around because there's symbols.
[157:22.34]Well, it's not.
[157:23.22]We have square and triangle.
[157:25.32]Alright, whatever.
[157:26.04]Fuck you.
[157:26.78]You go live in your own world.
[157:28.22]X, Y, B, A should be the same across the platforms that have X, Y, B, A. Literally, who cares?
[157:38.03]I do.
[157:50.28]Is it all downhill?
[158:03.25]Is he about to start crying?
[158:05.11]I've been really trying to hold it in this whole time.
[158:08.00]Okay, so don't go that way.
[158:11.76]Honest to God, don't go that way.
[158:14.08]What's the route?
[158:15.22]What's the right route?
[158:17.12]It's probably to the left.
[158:17.96]Over here.
[158:20.86]Has to be.
[158:23.08]As I go across this gap.
[158:25.78]There it is.
[158:26.60]Downhill.
[158:27.50]Don't go so hard.
[158:28.24]We're going to do six iron.
[158:31.24]At about 140 yards, I'm thinking a bit of strong wind will handle it.
[158:40.86]Alright.
[158:46.54]Nice.
[158:46.90]Okay.
[158:56.75]Time for Picross.
[158:57.39]It's not time for Picross.
[158:58.37]It's time for Picross when I say I'm going to play Picross.
[159:02.40]That's not right now.
[159:07.04]Need to hit it a little bit harder than I want to.
[159:16.71]That's in.
[159:18.41]Come on.
[159:20.21]That's such bullshit.
[159:21.21]Okay.
[159:29.80]Now we go this way.
[159:30.90]Which will take us... Oh, there's that one over there.
[159:39.77]Shit.
[159:39.99]I'm going to have to get that one later.
[159:41.63]Alright, if I go as hard as I can, I can get this at least to the sand trap.
[159:49.85]I'm going right there.
[159:52.47]Wind is blowing a little bit too.
[159:53.79]We're going full blast into the tornado.
[159:58.09]Wind, don't fucking screw me here.
[160:07.31]With the tornado... What happened to the tornado?!
[160:14.84]Now it's... I'm in big trouble!
[160:16.06]In Japan, the A button is on the bottom.
[160:26.82]On the West, Xbox has patents for button... bottom button on A that... That can't be real.
[160:31.80]If it is, that's fucking insane.
[160:41.51]now I'm so screwed what do I do now I can't just keep whacking into the wall I guess this way I'll have to come back that'll make it over that hill I hope nice shot
[161:10.85]Everyone PS1 games had confirm on circle.
[161:14.66]Well, that's the thing.
[161:17.02]Confirm is where circle is on just Nintendo.
[161:22.98]Circle is the rightmost button.
[161:26.36]A is the rightmost button, and that's confirm on Nintendo.
[161:34.46]It was like that on SNES too.
[161:35.81]Yeah, and then Xbox came along, put A on the bottom, and made that confirm.
[161:40.29]What are they thinking?
[161:44.03]How am I gonna... I can't just run up here, I don't think.
[161:52.70]Where am I going?
[161:53.38]I don't think I can walk up here.
[162:01.36]Nice.
[162:06.64]I have 30 seconds to do this, but 25 strokes...
[162:11.00]I think I need to level up before I go here.
[162:12.32]Look at this.
[162:15.02]This is horrible.
[162:15.88]38 yards.
[162:17.70]Alright, I'm gonna go, like, here.
[162:20.46]Alright, not bad.
[162:32.65]Straight on.
[162:33.01]Nothing fancy.
[162:46.29]because you're under leveled.
[162:47.23]I probably am.
[162:53.77]22 strokes.
[162:54.09]I have three holes left.
[162:56.92]This is going to be a monumental pain in the ass to get to the one down there.
[163:01.30]But I have to take what I can take and it's this here.
[163:03.46]Nice shot.
[163:16.49]Once that countdown for Picross ends, you're going to be very upset when I don't play the game.
[163:37.94]Are these worth one coin?
[163:43.08]Now I'll play a couple of rounds of Picross.
[163:45.48]I will.
[163:47.18]Gonna be weird with the controller though.
[163:48.34]Okay.
[163:59.92]Gonna curve a little bit with this wind.
[164:01.19]A lot of wind.
[164:01.87]Not sure what hurts more.
[164:04.07]We're just gonna go like this.
[164:21.04]Finally.
[164:21.46]Okay, 19 strokes to get two holes.
[164:27.56]This is the hard one.
[164:29.58]This is the one that I have trouble understanding.
[164:31.28]I think I have to hit it really hard.
[164:34.79]Just smash it so it flies up?
[164:39.01]Or... I don't know.
[164:40.45]How hard do I have to hit this?
[164:42.48]With a six iron?
[164:45.72]I don't know.
[164:50.46]I think I just have to smash it.
[164:51.54]Full power with the six iron.
[164:58.32]Yep.
[165:00.60]Did it go?
[165:07.83]What?
[165:09.79]No.
[165:11.65]It came all the way back.
[165:21.26]Uh, I have to put this back over here.
[165:23.66]There's no... Hit it with the driver and do backspin.
[165:33.77]I gotta get it back over there.
[165:36.83]I have to get this back in a better spot.
[165:44.61]No, not into the sand thing.
[165:46.31]God damn it.
[165:47.31]I didn't want to hit it that hard.
[165:49.94]Thank God.
[165:50.42]Okay.
[165:53.51]Alright.
[165:53.93]Drive it?
[165:55.75]And then put... How do I do backspin?
[165:58.89]Standard shot.
[166:00.35]Oops.
[166:00.55]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[166:01.65]I wanted to choose.
[166:02.67]I didn't get to choose.
[166:05.47]Fucking come on.
[166:06.57]I didn't want to do that.
[166:07.81]I was trying to choose a different, like, spin.
[166:12.16]It actually got up there.
[166:14.82]How did that happen?
[166:28.51]I think I can do this.
[166:32.03]Spin doesn't matter for what you're trying to do.
[166:35.68]Okay, this is the hard one.
[166:39.40]This is the one that sucks.
[166:40.14]Okay.
[166:51.58]This is going to curve a lot and there's a lot of wind, so I'm going to run into it here.
[166:54.82]There it is.
[167:01.97]Fifteen strokes to get one hole.
[167:03.75]There's one more across the whole game.
[167:16.82]I just have to drive it over and over again.
[167:18.50]Until I get there.
[167:21.99]Right?
[167:23.35]I should approach from here.
[167:26.59]Right?
[167:26.75]Because how uphill is that?
[167:28.35]I wonder.
[167:28.61]I'm going to approach them this way.
[167:31.01]God, I hope I make this.
[167:41.46]How am I going to get there?
[167:42.44]I only have two minutes.
[167:46.46]It didn't make it?
[167:49.13]Yes, it did.
[167:51.39]I was looking way too far.
[167:52.65]Ha ha ha.
[168:07.84]This is cool, though.
[168:16.39]I do have to get up there, though.
[168:18.53]I don't know how that's gonna happen.
[168:19.65]I don't know.
[168:23.70]I just have to guess.
[168:26.16]I gotta go over that.
[168:27.84]Dude, there's no way.
[168:30.68]Um... I have to get it on there first.
[168:34.80]I have 13 strokes.
[168:37.04]I'm gonna be alright.
[168:39.37]I gotta go from here to there.
[168:42.23]There's... Wait.
[168:46.85]Um... I don't know.
[168:55.07]I could hit it that way, but I don't think it'll get over there.
[168:58.13]That thing's downhill?
[168:59.05]Alright, I'm just gonna... I'm just fucking sending it.
[169:01.97]Who cares?
[169:04.59]It's gotta go in this general direction.
[169:06.62]I don't care where.
[169:13.18]We're good.
[169:25.98]Okay.
[169:27.82]Hey, I'm actually gonna complete it.
[169:34.91]This is down.
[169:35.63]I'll just send it, again.
[169:47.66]I think it'll cross over it.
[169:48.54]Did it make it across?
[169:50.56]It did.
[169:54.18]Alright, nice.
[170:00.95]Sims music is better than this.
[170:05.63]Where's the Mario music?
[170:10.96]Alright, 11 strokes.
[170:11.80]This would be hard to mess up.
[170:23.26]Mario's not in this?
[170:24.00]Yeah, he is.
[170:34.72]Think it.
[170:38.20]Okay, that was good.
[170:39.19]Got it.
[170:43.43]This isn't a Mario game?
[170:45.33]He's in the title.
[170:57.99]I have to put... I have to.
[170:59.05]Whoa, why are you doing that?
[171:07.43]What's going on with this bullshit?
[171:10.75]I lose points in the other one?
[171:20.51]Golly.
[171:23.30]Oh, this is bad.
[171:30.44]I don't want to do the qualifier.
[171:33.72]I have a Picross.
[171:42.01]This is fun, though.
[171:42.79]I liked this.
[171:43.33]Alright, I have to give it a rating so far.
[171:46.59]The person said that if this was not at least a 7.0, then that person gets banned for a month.
[171:52.29]They were in pre-stream chat.
[171:55.61]Hmm...
[172:06.84]Do what?
[172:11.26]This is not a 7, don't kid yourself.
[172:15.36]The thing is though, it could be.
[172:18.36]It actually could be.
[172:25.75]It's going to take me actually another few minutes to figure this out.
[172:31.25]Let me try some of the minigames first.
[172:33.25]That can really change my opinion.
[172:39.62]I want to play some of the, like, the Puck minigames, and the... Driving minigame, and... Those exist, right?
[172:53.67]Go to the main menu.
[172:54.67]Alright, is it on the main menu?
[172:56.37]Because I, we've tried this, this was cool.
[173:02.27]That was cool.
[173:06.80]What else we got?
[173:08.75]Play golf.
[173:09.27]Solo challenge.
[173:10.51]Okay.
[173:13.23]Door attack.
[173:14.57]Climb attack.
[173:17.53]One on one putt.
[173:20.87]Get one shot to find the green and one putt to get the ball in the hole.
[173:24.53]Nope.
[173:26.13]Aim for the targets.
[173:27.51]Okay.
[173:35.58]Speed golf.
[173:37.00]Battle golf.
[173:42.13]Alright, I wanna do Battle Golf.
[173:48.22]With four CPUs.
[173:49.68]I'm gonna play on Amateur.
[173:56.44]See!
[173:56.80]Look!
[173:57.00]They're all in this game!
[173:58.48]They're all in it!
[173:59.08]We have to hear all their voice lines.
[174:02.62]Yahoo!
[174:05.57]Yahoo!
[174:12.71]Wait, Pauline's in this?
[174:17.12]Cool!
[174:17.42]Okay.
[174:18.50]Okay.
[174:19.58]Mustache guy.
[174:42.80]Mustache Guy versus Pauline, and Donkey Kong, and Mario.
[174:49.56]Strategic, technical, simple terrain strategy.
[174:59.01]Alright, special shot.
[175:02.25]Where it's full energy.
[175:05.01]Shape shot.
[175:05.80]Top view.
[175:06.70]Whatever.
[175:07.02]Time for battle.
[175:10.68]Ready?
[175:12.40]First to three flags wins.
[175:25.27]Where is it?
[175:27.09]Where's my ball?
[175:32.60]This is fucking stupid.
[175:43.84]Wait, where is the... Did I not get it?
[175:48.33]Wait, what happened?
[175:49.15]Oh, it's gone.
[175:49.79]Alright, I'm going for this one.
[175:54.49]Let him fight for one.
[175:55.21]Who cares?
[175:56.27]I'm going for this one over here on the right.
[176:04.66]Alright, putt.
[176:05.36]Putt it, putt it, putt it.
[176:20.28]I got one.
[176:23.37]Donkey Kong is one away.
[176:24.69]I'm gonna do the effective thing of turning around and driving the wrong side of the road in Mario Kart.
[176:36.68]I don't even care if I win, I'm just gonna fuck it up for everybody else.
[176:49.76]Okay, where's the hole?
[176:51.62]Donkey Kong's... He's gonna win.
[176:56.92]Donkey Kong's up there.
[176:57.76]I gotta stop him.
[177:03.62]Stop!
[177:04.74]How do I fight him?
[177:06.67]How do I stop him?
[177:11.87]What do I do?
[177:16.31]Stop sliding!
[177:20.28]Where's my ball?
[177:25.54]Get in!
[177:28.86]Did I get it?
[177:32.14]Okay, that was... That was outrageous.
[177:46.55]Sure.
[177:51.62]Very cool.
[177:53.58]Let's go back to the main menu.
[177:55.40]I want to see the other thing.
[177:56.52]Battle Golf, Target Golf.
[178:03.58]Let's do this.
[178:04.02]And you know what?
[178:10.11]Fucking fine.
[178:13.53]I gotta play.
[178:14.27]I'm up.
[178:14.79]That character's weird.
[178:17.89]For a second I was like, who is this?
[178:28.71]what Mario character is that alright we'll do we'll go against um bowser uh rosalina and wario forest volcano we went to the volcano
[179:04.47]Who is Rosalina?
[179:05.45]You don't know who Rosalina is?
[179:09.01]Mario Galaxy.
[179:11.63]Hit the targets to score points.
[179:12.91]Highest score after five shots wins.
[179:14.73]Alright.
[179:15.11]Score the most.
[179:15.53]We just got to land.
[179:16.19]Are we doing it one at a time, right?
[179:19.93]Alright.
[179:21.72]Which one's worth more points?
[179:25.40]I'm going right in the middle here.
[179:26.44]Is there any win?
[179:28.18]Barely any.
[179:30.44]It's going to bounce a little bit that way.
[179:32.98]Here we go.
[179:40.10]You're in the middle.
[179:43.16]You can't get better than that.
[179:47.29]No, you can.
[179:49.81]That's alright.
[179:50.25]That's a good start.
[179:54.82]Here comes Bowser.
[180:07.41]So this is champ difficulty, which just means they're gonna get it in the middle every time.
[180:20.83]Yeah.
[180:22.13]It's gonna be a perfect shot every time.
[180:27.41]Wario's gonna mess it up.
[180:28.74]He's like a comedian, right?
[180:35.78]Yep.
[180:37.75]Where's Picross?
[180:38.83]You'll see it in a minute.
[180:42.65]Okay, ball one.
[180:44.65]Ball change.
[180:46.35]What is this?
[180:48.79]Egg ball?
[180:52.77]Key change.
[180:54.93]What's the ball do?
[180:55.81]What's the egg ball do?
[181:02.81]Just further away with more points?
[181:08.87]And does that mean that the middle's already been claimed?
[181:10.61]Good plate safe.
[181:24.40]Okay.
[181:25.50]No wind.
[181:26.00]Plate safe.
[181:27.98]It's downhill.
[181:28.70]Okay, I need, like, one, like, right, like, here.
[181:41.59]That's what it does.
[181:42.35]It bounces around.
[181:43.45]Roll back!
[181:44.67]Alright, whatever.
[181:47.25]You having a great day?
[181:48.05]I'm having a pretty good day, yeah.
[181:49.63]Hope you're having a good day.
[181:57.12]What was that?
[181:57.74]Don't get out of here with this bullshit.
[182:02.72]Yeah, okay.
[182:03.22]I was gonna say.
[182:08.10]That shuts points off.
[182:09.80]Nice shot!
[182:16.89]Nothing.
[182:25.19]Come on, hurry up.
[182:34.06]What?
[182:34.24]What?
[182:34.42]I'm in type of third place.
[182:42.99]Alright, I have one opportunity here.
[182:45.33]I gotta go with this middle ring here.
[182:55.44]It should land and bounce right into it.
[183:05.61]How are you this bad at Mario Golf?
[183:07.07]I'm about to potentially tie for first place on champion difficulty.
[183:14.32]Bowser can't get enough points to save him here.
[183:17.94]As you just saw.
[183:18.60]I'm literally tied for first place.
[183:20.80]And I literally might be tied for first place at the literal end of this game.
[183:26.02]What does Rosalina do?
[183:31.55]Bad.
[183:34.49]Keep going!
[183:35.47]Whatever.
[183:35.77]I come in second place.
[183:41.61]He's literally...
[183:45.69]Uh, there's not even enough points to get enough to win.
[183:48.17]Yeah, I'm in second place.
[183:49.31]I'll take second place, that's fine.
[183:56.68]60.
[183:56.76]I don't understand why they give him extra points for that.
[184:03.05]Literally next game.
[184:07.27]Uh, it's not over yet.
[184:27.18]That's too bouncy.
[184:28.12]Alright, I'm gonna play Picross.
[184:30.46]That was kind of fun.
[184:42.01]That was fun.
[184:43.35]That was fun.
[184:43.83]I gotta give you a rating though.
[184:46.92]And I think you're gonna have to ban that guy for a month.
[184:56.29]Well, hear me out.
[184:57.13]Let's figure it out.
[184:59.17]I think it's a solid experience.
[185:00.61]Like, it's fun.
[185:02.45]It needs to be a 7 out of 10.
[185:04.56]Or that person is banned for one full month.
[185:09.92]What makes it bad, though?
[185:11.86]Bad's a wrong word.
[185:12.68]What makes it not over a 7 for me?
[185:18.26]I feel like this game is a game that you... It's like on the TV in the college dorm room.
[185:23.86]And that makes it an 8.
[185:24.44]You know what I mean?
[185:28.31]Like, this is a college dorm room game.
[185:30.89]Which makes it a solid 8.
[185:34.49]As a 36-year-old in his office alone, I wouldn't say that.
[185:46.03]Hmm...
[185:50.24]You know, I'm gonna be fair.
[185:52.40]I actually think, okay, with that in mind, this is like a really good game to sit down, like you're in like a college dorm room with friends.
[185:58.22]Everyone's like, you know, everyone's like talking shit and like, oh my god, you fucked up my shot.
[186:02.13]That's an eight.
[186:04.65]But it's a six for me sitting here playing it by myself.
[186:07.39]So therefore, the average is probably somewhere around 7.0, 7.1.
[186:09.41]I'm gonna give this game a 7.2.
[186:20.13]But they can stay.
[186:26.22]I think this actually could be really fun with a group of people.
[186:33.16]More than three or four people all hanging out in a call playing this.
[186:36.64]Yep.
[186:38.03]That's an 8.0 game for sure.
[186:40.31]Maybe more.
[186:40.73]7.2.
[186:43.99]It's good.
[186:48.58]And there's like a story mode too.
[186:49.94]It's not just like, alright, that's good.
[186:51.42]It's good.
[186:51.74]I don't, I didn't hate it.
[186:52.46]Alright, let's play Picross.
[186:54.94]And then we're going to play Elden Ring.
[187:03.16]This is the worst game ever made.
[187:04.40]It's not.
[187:13.19]You gave Monster Ranger a 4.2?
[187:16.69]No, I... When did I give Monster Rancher... I gave Monster Rancher, like, a 9.
[187:19.24]What are you talking about?
[187:20.20]Alright, I need... Is Picross just on my...
