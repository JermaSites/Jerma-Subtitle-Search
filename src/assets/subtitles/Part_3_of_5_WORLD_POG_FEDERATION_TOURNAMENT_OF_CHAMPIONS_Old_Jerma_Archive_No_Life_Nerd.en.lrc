[00:00.81]Well, it looks like Joseph O'Connell and Matthew Smith have both been eliminated from the tournament.
[00:07.83]Good riddance.
[00:08.67]Now if you ask me, I don't think there's any place in the game for that kind of violent talk.
[00:13.42]But at least we get to spare the viewers' ears from hearing more of that shit.
[00:18.10]Which actually reminds me, I would like to apologize to all the fans out there who were offended by the athletes' remarks.
[00:25.14]Me too, Dick, me too.
[00:27.29]Well, let's move on, I guess.
[00:29.33]Our next matchup is between Norman Dafoe and Glenn Klubach.
[00:33.61]Now, this will be interesting, because you're matching up a germophobe, somebody who's terrified of filth and shies away from dirt and waste anytime he can, to a marine biologist.
[00:45.43]which is somebody who practically lives in fish shit.
[00:48.47]It is incredible.
[00:49.25]I cannot wait to see this matchup.
[00:51.19]But just wait for a second.
[00:53.09]I would like to take this opportunity to show everybody just how bad Norman Dafoe's germophobia really is.
[00:59.79]Has this been cleaned at all in the last, like, 14, 15 minutes or so?
[01:08.25]Like, 20 minutes or so?
[01:11.27]No, that's fine.
[01:12.26]I got it.
[01:12.58]That's cool.
[01:20.84]Nah, it's not like a, not a huge deal or anything.
[01:23.72]Oh, God.
[01:27.36]What's that?
[01:27.68]Nah, it's just, you know, some people sit on these seats and they never wash their hands or they never wash their feet or anything like that and they just think, it's okay though, I got it, it's under control, got it.
[01:38.43]Cool.
[01:39.47]Okay.
[01:39.93]Okay, alright, like, is it, will we be okay?
[01:44.65]Will we be good?
[01:45.79]Does it make sense?
[01:46.49]I'll just put my hands here.
[01:51.17]I started when I was a little kid.
[01:52.73]Can I do this again?
[01:54.51]Can I clean this again?
[01:55.52]I'm sorry.
[01:56.44]I don't feel like I did it good enough, you know what I mean?
[02:06.55]No, yeah, I was born with it.
[02:09.91]It's a curse, I know.
[02:19.69]It's already clean, right?
[02:23.73]He's back to nodding.
[02:30.47]Well, if you think that's bad, folks, take a look at Klubach and how nervous he was before this match.
[02:57.61]Jeez.
[02:58.09]Can this guy get his act together for even a minute?
[03:00.84]Doesn't look like it.
[03:03.12]How you doing?
[03:04.20]Hey.
[03:04.60]You ready to play?
[03:05.40]Yeah.
[03:06.36]Nice to meet you.
[03:09.06]How are you?
[03:09.42]How you doing?
[03:10.06]What's wrong?
[03:11.12]Nothing.
[03:11.58]You can't shake my hand?
[03:12.74]No, I can't.
[03:13.16]I just... I need to... What the hell is wrong?
[03:18.56]Nothing.
[03:19.02]What the hell are you doing?
[03:21.63]Just give me your hand.
[03:23.89]Just give me your hand again.
[03:24.95]Just give me your hand.
[03:39.93]9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[03:41.61]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[03:44.55]Okay.
[03:46.71]So I guess you're a little bit of a germaphobe, huh?
[03:58.31]I guess you could say something like that.
[04:01.17]No, I like to keep my area clean and I like to keep everything safe and make sure nobody gets hurt and stuff like that.
[04:09.00]Hold on, I'm sorry.
[04:09.96]I'm really sorry.
[04:13.78]So, I hear you are a traveler, right?
[04:16.39]Yeah, I'm a marine biologist.
[04:19.65]I go in the ocean, you know, explore things.
[04:23.05]What's that like?
[04:24.23]It's great.
[04:24.71]It's a little dirty, but... Play the game.
[04:26.49]Play the game.
[04:26.89]Let's go.
[04:28.11]Where's yours?
[04:28.55]Right here.
[04:31.67]Hold on.
[04:42.59]Good shot!
[04:43.23]Good shot!
[04:44.09]Good job!
[04:44.59]Yeah!
[04:45.87]You won't come out.
[04:48.57]Okay, hold on, hold on!
[04:57.06]Cut!
[04:57.68]Cut it!
[04:58.18]Now!
[05:00.02]Just give me a wipe, will you?
[05:01.02]Take them and fucking do it!
[05:02.82]Please!
[05:05.25]Hold on, I'll just do this while you're doing it.
[05:13.07]He looks like he's gonna be sick.
[05:15.43]You can't be fucking serious.
[05:17.05]I didn't sign up for this shit.
[05:18.85]Are you ready to play?
[05:21.96]Yeah, take yours off.
[05:25.44]Thank you.
[05:26.86]Don't touch any of mine.
[05:39.82]No problem, I'm sorry.
[05:41.04]I was going to get paid to be here for like... We need a fucking break.
[05:50.94]Slide attack.
[05:53.86]Don't even... Don't do that.
[06:02.88]One, two, three, four, five.
[06:05.56]Wow, what a shot by Glenn Flubach.
[06:07.64]That's five hogs.
[06:10.78]So, Africa probably was cool, huh?
[06:15.61]Yeah, it was awesome.
[06:17.09]What's wrong with Africa?
[06:18.61]Nothing, just don't look at it.
[06:32.41]You just blatantly cheated.
[06:34.43]No, I didn't.
[06:35.31]You just blatantly cheated.
[06:36.79]No, I couldn't do that.
[06:38.07]Get your fucking Jerma headphones off that.
[06:41.26]Fucking freak.
[06:41.98]I'll clean them.
[06:42.56]Just give me a chance.
[06:43.38]These are mine now, right?
[06:46.66]I get these, right?
[06:47.72]These are mine, right?
[06:48.98]I guess so.
[06:49.62]I cheated.
[06:50.02]Take them.
[06:50.34]I'm sorry.
[06:50.78]Go.
[06:50.86]Take them.
[06:51.55]I'm so sorry.
[06:52.11]I'm sorry, my friend.
[06:53.81]I really am sorry.
[06:56.00]We've already gotten this goddamn tournament in the first place.
[06:58.66]Let's play Pogs!
[06:59.58]Nothing is bullshit!
[07:00.60]It's your turn.
[07:01.18]No, it's my turn.
[07:01.88]Your turn.
[07:02.58]My turn.
[07:03.12]Okay, it's your turn.
[07:07.34]Go.
[07:07.76]Okay, you found them.
[07:16.08]It's prescribed by a doctor.
[07:17.06]It's prescribed.
[07:17.60]Go.
[07:18.48]Count them.
[07:18.88]It's prescribed.
[07:19.87]One, two, three.
[07:20.99]It's prescribed by a doctor.
[07:23.05]Wait a minute.
[07:23.89]Isn't that just water?
[07:25.88]Can we get this game on, please?
[07:27.32]Yeah.
[07:35.00]I'm not sure Norman Dafoe even knows how to play pucks.
[07:38.44]Alright, I guess I'll keep him then.
[07:40.12]Looks like you're losing.
[07:41.67]I don't even understand this.
[07:42.65]I don't know how a freak like you got in here in the first place.
[07:45.79]Call this my lucky slammer.
[07:47.11]It's a shock slammer.
[07:48.27]Take a bite right out of you.
[07:49.89]Three.
[07:51.85]All three.
[07:52.65]Game over!
[07:55.50]Really.
[07:55.92]Great game again.
[07:56.78]Great game.
[07:57.22]All of them.
[07:58.07]Got all of them.
[07:58.81]Good job.
[08:00.13]You shake my hand.
[08:00.93]I hate to do this again, but your whole body just looks like it hasn't been washed in days.
[08:05.03]I am so sorry.
[08:06.33]I'm sorry.
[08:07.25]I'm sorry.
[08:08.03]I'm so sorry.
[08:09.33]I think you just whined at him.
[08:12.02]Why did I do that?
[08:12.92]Why did I do that?
[08:15.12]Why did I do that to somebody?
[08:16.92]Why did I do that?
[08:20.82]Yeah, that can't be good for your eyes, hot dog.
[08:23.02]Here's a look at the tournament brackets so far.
[08:33.28]Now we must apologize for that one, folks.
[08:35.68]The World Park Federation never condones the use of chemicals in any of its matches.
[08:41.93]The next matchup is between Stuart Swanson and Michael Manson.
[08:46.29]Now, this one promises to be a doozy, folks, because we're matching up seven-time world champion Michael Manson against a no-life nerd who's never gotten pussy before in his entire life.
[08:59.06]Let's go to the arena.
