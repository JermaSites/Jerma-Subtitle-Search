[00:27.50]Welcome to another stream, guys.
[00:30.66]How you doing?
[00:34.10]I just, I did just brush my teeth.
[00:36.62]They're nice and clean.
[00:39.25]Can you hear it?
[00:44.35]I'm running my tongue across the front of my teeth.
[00:55.02]So tonight we're gonna play
[00:58.81]Hotline Miami.
[01:00.85]Because I know I'm kind of... I'm kind of jebaiting everybody here.
[01:07.07]Last night, I said tonight we're going to play EDF.
[01:10.93]But that was determined to be a lie.
[01:13.91]Well, not a lie, but... I wanted to play Mi, Star, and Etalyx are going to play it.
[01:22.79]But we couldn't... People need to get this stuff ready.
[01:29.17]And we weren't all on the same page for today.
[01:32.31]So... Tomorrow... We're gonna play it tomorrow.
[01:37.85]So stream tonight, stream tomorrow.
[01:42.71]So... Star needed to set up some of his stuff.
[01:46.51]He wasn't really ready to play it.
[01:49.41]And we're gonna wait till tomorrow.
[01:50.57]Because I obviously want to play with friends and... The game is way more enjoyable that way.
[01:56.29]So...
[01:59.59]So, we're going to play Hotline Miami tonight.
[02:04.71]Somebody just wrote, this is going to be very bad.
[02:09.65]Why?
[02:12.46]Very bad?
[02:13.50]Is that true?
[02:14.52]Yeah.
[02:15.74]But why, though?
[02:19.66]Should I prepare myself for something that I'm not going to have fun with?
[02:28.80]Yes.
[02:34.38]It's a very hard game.
[02:37.69]Well, whatever, we'll be fine.
[02:41.05]I'm not concerned about game difficulty.
[02:45.19]You guys have seen me play plenty of games that require skill and focus, and I just run them over with a lawnmower.
[02:56.62]It might be jagged.
[02:58.94]When the baseball comes shooting out of the lawnmower, it's gonna be torn up and all fucked up, but at least I did it.
[03:13.38]And no somebody said am I gonna do a face cam tonight because I'm brushing my teeth No, I don't have any clothes on Everybody thinks this is a joke and thinks I'm making this up.
[03:25.35]I am I don't have clothes on I have underwear and pants I Mean that's that's clothes.
[03:32.55]That's it No, I can't wear clothes
[03:37.29]I only wear clothes when I have to go out somewhere, when I have to leave the house.
[03:40.78]It is an absolute nuisance for me to wear clothing.
[03:51.44]Oh yeah, prove it.
[03:52.26]Sure, let me like turn it on.
[03:54.44]No, I don't wear shirts.
[03:56.32]I only wear shirts because I sweat through everything I put on.
[03:59.38]So, if I put on a t-shirt, oh yeah, I'm gonna do laundry.
[04:03.98]Oh, nice, fresh, clean laundry.
[04:05.42]And I put on a shirt, in two hours, three hours, it'll be wet.
[04:11.21]And it's not gross.
[04:12.61]It's not gross or anything.
[04:13.91]I don't understand.
[04:17.22]If I go out with that same shirt on, right?
[04:20.42]If I put that same t-shirt on and go out of the house, I will not sweat a single drop.
[04:26.40]Not one drop will come out.
[04:28.04]I'll be dry all day, all night.
[04:30.88]I sit in a chair and just sweat comes off my body.
[04:35.38]I don't understand why.
[04:36.11]Does anybody have a logical medical explanation as to why that happens?
[04:52.45]And I'm not, like, smelly or anything, I'm just wet.
[04:55.33]It's like somebody threw water, like, cupped water in a basin and, like, onto my armpits.
[05:03.74]It's just liquid.
[05:06.00]But anyways.
[05:07.88]Uh, we're gonna play Hotline Miami tonight.
[05:10.92]I've heard it's a very hard game from, you know, people in the chatroom here.
[05:14.39]It's a very hard game.
[05:16.19]So everybody be careful with it.
[05:18.53]Uh, it might be a little loud, I'm just making you aware of that.
[05:24.20]Stalling?
[05:24.96]I'm not stalling.
[05:25.64]We're just... I'm just talking.
[05:31.16]Stalling.
[05:31.52]It's been six minutes!
[05:35.56]I'm at the title screen.
[05:36.38]I'm just gonna make sure it gets captured correctly.
[05:39.64]Because if it doesn't, then I'm gonna be really, really, really, really, really, really angry.
[05:46.88]There it is.
[05:47.36]Okay.
[05:47.68]Hotline Miami.
[05:50.98]And it should pop up on the screen.
[05:54.78]Literally.
[05:56.22]Right now.
[05:57.96]Hey, there it is.
[05:59.82]So, I have not played this game before.
[06:03.49]I don't know how this works.
[06:04.99]I know it's a top-down... Like, almost looks to me like original GTA.
[06:12.99]The same kind of top-down, right?
[06:15.13]And the same animations when you punch people.
[06:20.41]Did I tweet this?
[06:24.15]Okay, I did.
[06:24.59]Alright.
[06:26.67]The music's incredible.
[06:27.51]I've heard it's really fun.
[06:28.65]I'm playing keyboard and mouse.
[06:29.89]Please correct me if that's wrong.
[06:35.35]Should I be playing with, like, an Xbox controller?
[06:40.42]Alright.
[06:42.50]Okay.
[06:45.04]So, Hotline Miami.
[06:46.02]Here we go.
[06:47.90]I'm here to tell you how to kill people.
[06:51.32]Okay, so I'm... Alright, I'm Pinocchio.
[06:53.50]So...
[07:19.91]Alright, now you should try killing the next guy.
[07:22.26]But use the bat in the red room over here, okay?
[07:24.80]This game's too hard!
[07:25.96]I can already tell.
[07:30.82]I can already tell this game's too hard.
[07:35.77]When you press the left mouse button to swing it.
[07:37.51]Okay, did that get through your head?
[07:38.79]So right click and then left click.
[07:43.35]Alright, right click, and then... Oh man, this is fun, but it's gonna be very hard for me.
[07:52.91]Well done, so let's get to the gun, shall we?
[07:55.89]You go and get the shotgun in the blue room.
[07:59.47]You do it the same way you picked up the bat.
[08:02.11]Just press the right mouse button, can you handle that?
[08:04.03]Use the shift button to look for enemies out of view.
[08:07.35]It's very useful for not getting yourself killed.
[08:11.21]Press the scroll wheel to lock onto enemies.
[08:14.13]Just make sure to place your crosshair over them first.
[08:17.47]Right mouse to grab.
[08:18.47]Shift to look.
[08:20.29]Left mouse button to shoot.
[08:21.27]Scroll wheel to lock on.
[08:23.99]Okay, hold on.
[08:24.41]Let me check that out.
[08:27.33]So, shift lets you look.
[08:30.65]Where that's lock on.
[08:33.85]So... Scroll wheel lock on.
[08:47.31]Okay.
[08:52.65]Got it.
[08:53.52]Alright, that about sums up the basics.
[08:55.28]However... However.
[08:58.02]There's always more tricks to learn.
[09:00.00]You can throw any weapon you pick up by pressing your right mouse button.
[09:05.21]You can use doors to knock enemies over.
[09:07.29]Guns are very loud and will alert your foes.
[09:10.11]So plan your moves and use melee weapons when you can.
[09:14.08]God damn it.
[09:15.30]You'll just get yourself killed.
[09:17.98]Why did I do that?
[09:19.58]Won't you?
[09:25.30]Phone calls!
[09:30.54]I don't know what that accent was.
[09:34.80]And who do we have here?
[09:35.84]We've got a horseman.
[09:39.72]Oh, you don't know who you are.
[09:41.04]Maybe we should leave it that way.
[09:47.07]We got a horse.
[09:47.99]We got Brojack Horseman.
[09:49.31]Chicken Little.
[09:50.73]I know you.
[09:51.57]Look at my face.
[09:52.33]We've met before.
[09:53.79]Haven't we?
[09:56.29]I don't know you.
[09:58.33]Why are you here?
[10:00.80]You're no guest.
[10:01.34]That's an OWO face.
[10:04.00]You're no guest of mine.
[10:04.94]Do you really want me to reveal who you are?
[10:08.86]Knowing oneself means acknowledging one's actions.
[10:13.81]As of lately, you've done some terrible things.
[10:17.65]Does April the 3rd mean anything to you?
[10:22.17]I believe that was the day of our first encounter.
[10:26.23]You look like you might be remembering something.
[10:32.94]April 3rd, 1989, Miami, Florida.
[10:34.80]Okay, this is just an intro to Earthbound.
[10:43.97]Same music too.
[10:51.31]Am I gonna get, like, attacked?
[10:58.32]You have one new message.
[10:59.58]Hi, this is Tim at the bakery.
[11:02.00]The cookies that you ordered shall be delivered by now.
[11:05.28]A list of ingredients are included.
[11:06.80]Make sure that you read them carefully.
[11:09.32]Click.
[11:10.58]Okay.
[11:13.60]Music needs to be louder.
[11:14.88]I... I can't.
[11:17.65]I can't right now.
[11:18.81]Just wait.
[11:19.23]Just wait till I get through the first level.
[11:23.60]Cookies.
[11:25.36]That's my DPI.
[11:26.96]It's not bad.
[11:29.08]The target is a briefcase.
[11:31.06]Discretion is of essence.
[11:32.82]Leave target at point F32 inside the dumpster.
[11:36.68]Failure is not an option.
[11:37.64]We'll be watching you.
[11:43.73]It's gotta be louder.
[11:47.57]Why is everybody adding me?
[11:51.50]Look, can I go on my balcony?
[11:53.14]I don't even have a balcony.
[11:58.48]Do I get to upgrade my house?
[12:00.12]Is this a game where you make money and upgrade your house?
[12:02.83]Can I have, like, cool stuff in the way?
[12:04.25]Like, turn it into a sim?
[12:05.27]Okay, I'm just... Get inside of Christopher Lloyd's time travel car.
[12:13.72]The Metro.
[12:18.41]Richard.
[12:19.83]Unavailable.
[12:20.45]Whoa.
[12:21.47]Okay.
[12:22.67]Looks like I'm Richard.
[12:27.79]Do I have to talk to anybody, or is this just time to play the game?
[12:31.27]Oh!
[12:32.85]Break his neck!
[12:42.18]Did I win?
[12:43.10]No, I lost.
[12:43.74]I... Okay.
[12:55.11]Okay, you gotta be quick.
[12:56.19]You gotta be very quick.
[12:57.21]Yeah, there's a guy on the phone.
[13:03.89]Guy walking around over here.
[13:05.91]Thank god there's a checkpoint.
[13:21.36]Okay, got it.
[13:22.92]Is this a gun?
[13:31.18]I don't think this is a gun.
[13:39.95]What?
[13:40.31]Whoops.
[13:53.22]This is too stressful for me.
[13:54.12]Is that a- Whoa!
[13:58.91]Okay, good.
[14:09.14]Oh man, oh no, wait, how do I get rid of the briefcase?
[14:12.60]How do I throw the briefcase down?
[14:29.21]I want to drop briefcase
[14:37.20]What, you fucking idiot!
[14:38.34]Oh my god!
[14:42.20]Just go, go, hurry up.
[14:50.59]Break his neck!
[14:51.17]Alright, go to the car.
[15:03.26]I did it.
[15:06.86]Is there more?
[15:07.30]Oh, I gotta leave it in the dumpster.
[15:14.76]Who's there?
[15:15.22]I can hear you.
[15:15.72]I know you're there.
[15:19.84]Stage clear.
[15:30.09]Alright.
[15:31.75]Chapter clear.
[15:40.68]Wait, was I not supposed to kill that guy?
[15:42.10]Was that the guy in the video?
[15:49.65]Did I do it?
[15:50.73]Was I not supposed to do that?
[16:02.82]Killing.
[16:04.80]Baloney.
[16:06.93]No, that's, sorry, that's a Spanish saying.
[16:09.03]That's a Spanish way to say it.
[16:10.45]Baloney.
[16:17.02]Uh, time bonus, flexibility, mobility, whatever.
[16:26.04]I got a B!
[16:30.50]Execution, exposure, two times combo, execution, execution, B.
[16:36.99]I got a new mask.
[16:40.71]Erasmus.
[16:41.17]What do you mean mediocre?
[16:44.69]Generic.
[16:46.51]A B is not generic.
[16:47.68]A B means you did a good job.
[16:51.92]Generic B. Give me a break.
[16:55.36]Hi there, man.
[16:56.00]Haven't seen you around.
[16:58.40]Thought something might have happened to you.
[17:00.70]You seem really down over losing your girlfriend.
[17:04.95]Don't remember seeing you after that.
[17:07.81]Maybe we should talk about something else.
[17:09.67]So, out for a midnight snack, huh?
[17:11.49]Nah, don't worry about it.
[17:12.29]It's still in the house.
[17:13.76]Good to see you.
[17:14.66]Have a nice night.
[17:21.06]I didn't do anything.
[17:24.86]What is this guy eating?
[17:26.62]Oh, is that sushi?
[17:28.08]I love sushi.
[17:30.18]Sushi?
[17:31.08]Sushi?
[17:32.54]What else I got?
[17:40.50]Okay.
[17:47.62]What?
[17:47.84]Everyone's upset that I said sushi?
[17:49.45]What's happening?
[17:53.03]I said sushi!
[17:54.53]Because it looked like it was sushi.
[17:56.11]And I love sushi.
[17:57.29]And all of a sudden I'm a bad guy?
[18:01.75]You have one message.
[18:02.73]Hello, it's Linda.
[18:03.97]I need a babysitter.
[18:05.35]Right away, I got a few kids that need to be disciplined here.
[18:08.71]I'm at East 7th Street.
[18:10.53]Make sure you have a long talk with them.
[18:12.62]I really need someone to get through to these rascals, and like last time, please be discreet.
[18:19.38]Turn it up?
[18:20.64]I have to quit the game to turn it up.
[18:22.26]Just wait.
[18:23.20]Just wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18:28.70]Guys, I was at a B, okay?
[18:32.30]I'm at a B for music.
[18:34.83]That's the kind of person that I am.
[18:40.07]I'm only- a B or- That's as high as it goes.
[18:46.81]Take music to an A+.
[18:49.64]No, music's gonna be an A. I get just 97.
[18:54.98]That's fine.
[18:56.46]Nah, it's up all the way.
[19:02.01]This one's called No Talk.
[19:05.87]Look, I'm getting the... I can see the whole level now.
[19:09.69]Start with Intro?
[19:10.49]No.
[19:12.61]Don't be afraid of dying, is what this thing says.
[19:19.06]Richard.
[19:20.26]An eye for secrets.
[19:21.58]What does that mean?
[19:24.14]Alright, let's go.
[19:24.62]Let's take a look.
[19:25.48]Who's inside?
[19:26.30]Long Corridor.
[19:29.26]Long Corridor again.
[19:30.12]That's it.
[19:30.58]Nothing else.
[19:32.46]Discipline the people in here.
[19:33.94]Alright, we've got... Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[19:38.16]Guy up here leads to guy... Nobody in the living room?
[19:41.70]Kitchen.
[19:42.42]Alright, kill guy in kitchen, shoot his head off, and then take his gun, right?
[19:48.58]That's... I almost just passed out.
[20:02.77]Psycho.
[20:08.47]Okay, I got a gun.
[20:09.31]Two rounds.
[20:12.95]Two... Alright, guy with a gun and a guy sitting on the couch.
[20:14.83]I can take a... Shoot guy, throw a gun at guy.
[20:24.18]Alright, I got it.
[20:31.58]Who's in this room?
[20:32.14]We got a guy on the couch, guy with a gun, and that's it.
[20:36.99]Wait!
[20:37.67]I need run- I need bullets.
[20:40.75]Is there any more guns?
[20:44.45]No gun.
[20:45.45]Okay, six rounds.
[20:49.04]Check this out, ready?
[20:50.54]Bingo, and then bango.
[21:02.43]Oh, come on!
[21:03.33]What?
[21:06.24]What the fuck was that?
[21:07.62]I missed him and he hit his head on the door.
[21:13.28]I gotta wait till he turns.
[21:33.56]No lock-on.
[21:34.62]Lock-on is going to hurt me.
[21:35.84]Lock-on is going to be bad.
[21:36.70]Unless I can plan what I want to do.
[21:38.58]This guy had a crazy gun too.
[21:50.95]Alright, I'm good.
[21:55.57]You shift to look further?
[21:56.89]That's what I've been doing!
[21:57.75]What are you talking about?
[21:58.57]I've been doing that this whole time!
[22:00.69]I've been using shift the entire time.
[22:09.45]Quite the discreet operation.
[22:16.18]What a 2010 streamer.
[22:19.54]You can look further away.
[22:22.36]What?
[22:23.05]Why is... A minus.
[22:27.25]See, I turned up the... I turned up the volume.
[22:33.63]What?
[22:33.93]Why is the... Alright, now you're just... Now you're just being...
[22:39.03]Bastards.
[22:41.55]Now we got Tony.
[22:44.83]We got three masks now.
[22:47.77]God, I love pizza.
[22:51.97]I haven't had- you know what?
[22:52.71]It's crazy.
[22:53.25]I haven't had pizza in like three months.
[22:55.20]Because I've been trying to stay away from bread.
[22:58.88]Because my whole body is like all fucked up.
[23:02.16]I've been not going to minute details.
[23:05.17]I'm trying to stay away from gluten, because I feel like I'm developing a gluten intolerance, and I've got a doctor's appointment coming up.
[23:11.57]I've missed pizza.
[23:14.65]Hey there, welcome!
[23:15.53]Oh, you don't need to order, your pizza's already done.
[23:21.73]Gluten-free pizza?
[23:22.63]Yeah, but you have to, like, go specially get it.
[23:24.60]You can't go... You can't go into, like, Pizza Hut or Domino's or... and order, like, a gluten-free pizza, can you?
[23:39.57]Don't get me wrong, I would eat a whole entire pizza to myself right now.
[23:44.86]But every time I've been eating bread, I get like sick.
[23:50.42]And it's, I don't know.
[23:51.74]And I've got a doctor's appointment coming up so you can find out what the fuck's wrong with me.
[23:55.46]Let's leave it at that for now, shall we?
[23:56.74]Yeah, I agree.
[23:59.04]Don't worry about paying, it's on the house.
[24:06.98]And then I don't know if it's something to do with, like, colitis or... I have no idea.
[24:11.82]But it's really, really not cool.
[24:15.36]You forget just how much shit has, like, bread or wheat or gluten in it when you try to avoid it.
[24:20.94]It's wild.
[24:26.25]So I got my pizza.
[24:26.91]And a phone call.
[24:33.73]You got one new message.
[24:38.43]Just eat it.
[24:39.05]I mean, I could, but it doesn't feel very good.
[24:41.97]This is Thomas from the Methadone Clinic.
[24:44.92]We've scheduled a short meeting for you tonight.
[24:49.60]We're at Northwest 184th Street, apartment 105, and don't worry, we know discretion is of importance to our clients.
[25:00.47]Click.
[25:04.97]This game's pretty fun.
[25:08.00]Why have I never played this game in, like, the seven years that it's been available to play?
[25:16.18]This one's called Overdose.
[25:17.04]You can shoot through some walls.
[25:21.92]Fists of Fury and Eye for Secrets.
[25:26.09]Uh, I'm gonna assume this means... harder punches?
[25:33.15]Alright, so guy's sitting on the chair, guy at the front door.
[25:36.33]We're gonna go front door, punch, break guy's neck into the other room.
[25:42.03]Avoid the piano.
[25:49.98]We got guy with a gun, guy pissing.
[25:54.78]Break his neck, space!
[26:07.51]I need that.
[26:11.25]Alright, I got a gun now.
[26:12.35]I don't think I want to use it though.
[26:18.82]No, I don't.
[26:19.24]I got a guy down at the piano.
[26:36.22]I knocked him out.
[26:45.12]Oh shit, I don't have any more weapons.
[26:46.16]What am I doing?
[26:47.76]Okay, we're good.
[26:53.25]Oh fuck.
[27:07.68]Oh no!
[27:09.48]Oh no.
[27:22.86]Oh, give me this.
[27:28.85]Is somebody left?
[27:30.71]Who's still alive?
[27:31.55]I'm gonna die.
[27:32.43]I'm gonna walk in a room that... Okay, that guy down there.
[27:35.67]He's the only guy left.
[27:36.29]Alright, I got it.
[27:46.73]Let's get out of here.
[27:47.83]Can I get this thing?
[27:48.41]Oh, that's not real.
[27:57.22]Crab?
[27:57.60]What do you mean crab?
[27:58.46]Crab.
[27:58.94]Crab.
[28:03.08]Grab the crab?
[28:08.89]Dead guy.
[28:09.37]Oh, what's this thing?
[28:14.67]Earl.
[28:14.99]Alright, give me fucking A plus for that one.
[28:23.40]Didn't even need to restart that one.
[28:31.68]Boomer accidentally activates sticky keys.
[28:35.31]Well that didn't, what?
[28:52.71]Good combos, I had a few combos there.
[28:56.12]Flexibility, like I threw the, remember I threw the thing at the guy and it bounced off the wall and I bounced back and I hit him and I shot him?
[29:00.80]New weapon unlocked and it's an A. Whew!
[29:14.78]New mask.
[29:16.11]Aubrey and Earl.
[29:19.15]Okay.
[29:19.91]New weapon.
[29:21.71]Do I get to start with this or something?
[29:23.25]Samurai sword.
[29:31.45]This is fun.
[29:33.97]I'm glad I played this.
[29:37.81]Hey dude, good to see you again.
[29:40.41]Did you hear about the massacre the other night?
[29:42.55]Bunch of, uh, rusties I heard.
[29:44.73]No loss, if you ask me.
[29:47.66]They say some maniac wearing a rubber mask did it.
[29:49.98]Jesus.
[29:51.10]Sounds like a scene straight from a slasher flick.
[29:56.38]Yeah, I have the perfect film for you.
[29:59.89]The one on the desk.
[30:00.73]Take it.
[30:01.03]It's on the house.
[30:01.81]Enjoy yourself, dude.
[30:08.18]Why does this guy keep giving me free stuff?
[30:20.22]I should play the second one, too.
[30:21.84]Well, one step at a time.
[30:25.61]April 25th.
[30:35.28]Hi, it's Kate from Hotline Miami's Dating Service.
[30:39.02]We have set up a date for you this evening.
[30:41.32]Should be waiting for you at Southwest 53rd Place.
[30:44.82]As usual, make sure you wear something fancy.
[30:46.68]Do I have to go to my wardrobe?
[30:53.18]All I have is a Nintendo console with two games.
[31:00.88]I don't have any of that.
[31:01.64]I don't have any clothes.
[31:14.79]This is called... decadence.
[31:19.69]Alright, what did we unlock?
[31:21.41]More guns... or... where's Earl?
[31:26.28]Survive two bullets!
[31:32.68]That seems kind of... crazy.
[31:34.18]That seems like it's even... that makes it... No, I don't want to be Earl yet.
[31:38.46]Not until I need it.
[31:39.10]Let's do more, uh... Let's do more guns.
[31:45.21]Alright, scope it out.
[31:47.95]Front door.
[31:49.69]Okay, we're gonna do this in one shot.
[31:51.93]You ready for me?
[31:53.01]You ready for me?
[31:54.39]Front door, knock the guy out.
[31:55.49]Grab the gun in the left room.
[31:56.89]Head to the left, shoot all three people with gun.
[31:59.53]Run out, throw gun at guy here, punch guy here, break that guy's neck, shoot that guy with gun that he drops.
[32:06.91]Go!
[32:12.19]Oh, that didn't work.
[32:22.81]Alright, so... I'm gonna go this way.
[32:28.57]Ooh, hit me right in the head.
[32:35.88]What the f-?
[32:36.68]Mmm.
[32:42.86]Whoa!
[32:50.35]Should've picked Earl.
[32:54.36]I gotta take it slow.
[33:00.38]Who's in here?
[33:00.86]Is this guy watching TV?
[33:04.27]How do I get in there?
[33:04.83]Alright, it's possible.
[33:09.67]It's very possible that I go... If this guy turns... I mean, I can get this guy without this guy knowing, I think.
[33:14.95]Oh, fuck.
[33:21.98]Oh, shit.
[33:22.72]My pants.
[33:34.36]Damn it!
[33:34.86]Oh, the guy's next to me, fuck!
[33:40.48]Oh, shit!
[33:46.59]I didn't... Oh, fuck.
[33:53.09]Okay, I gotta calm down.
[33:57.43]Oh, shit!
[34:04.83]Oh my god.
[34:11.48]Oh my fucking god.
[34:21.70]Damn it!
[34:22.18]Oh my god.
[34:22.70]Put the other mask on.
[34:29.03]Did I not kill that guy?
[34:30.07]How did they not hear this?
[34:33.13]He's alive.
[34:33.57]The door blocked it.
[34:54.52]I gotta do this quietly.
[34:55.44]I need a melee weapon.
[34:56.48]Is there a melee weapon in here?
[34:57.28]You know what I'm saying?
[35:02.87]It's gotta be shoot, shoot.
[35:03.83]You gotta shoot.
[35:04.53]I need six rounds here.
[35:05.64]I'm not sure I can do this silently.
[35:29.72]Oh my lord, this is fucking hard!
[35:38.90]Get back in!
[35:39.42]How do I get in the car?
[35:45.33]Wait, did I fucking ruin everything for myself?
[35:48.69]I think I did.
[35:50.87]I think I understand what happened here.
[35:53.32]That guy's got a melee weapon, get him!
[36:06.90]Uh, did I... Hold on a minute.
[36:10.02]Did me spawning Aubrey make more guns appear and not melee weapons?
[36:16.45]Hold on a second.
[36:17.11]I'm curious about this.
[36:17.83]Okay, I... Look at this.
[36:21.33]That's why.
[36:21.79]I figured it out.
[36:24.05]Oh.
[36:27.72]That's why I can't do anything.
[36:29.18]Is this guy trying to get away?
[36:40.51]Now I can do this without alerting the whole house.
[36:45.51]Alright, so this is what's going to happen.
[36:46.83]Now, listen, I figured it out.
[36:50.32]Once these guys are out of the way, I'm going to kill him and leave the room.
[36:53.64]Three, two, one, go.
[36:55.80]Fuck me.
[37:01.46]I forgot about the guy at the end of the hall.
[37:02.98]We're going to be here all night.
[37:04.74]Is he dead?
[37:09.06]He's not dead.
[37:43.63]Hit him with the door.
[37:49.91]How far does the door go?
[37:50.89]Oh shit.
[38:15.43]I'm almost done.
[38:16.01]These guys down here need to die first.
[38:21.11]We've got Guy walking, patrolling.
[38:23.61]I'm gonna hit him with the door.
[38:24.64]I'm gonna shoot the guy in front of me.
[38:29.38]And then I don't know what I'm gonna do after that.
[38:30.74]I'm gonna improvise after that one.
[38:49.32]My whole body just... That's not over.
[38:57.93]I need a good weapon.
[39:02.29]Homer Simpson.
[39:04.14]Fuck, at least I have a checkpoint.
[39:10.06]Legit scared, I know.
[39:22.96]I'm just panicking.
[39:24.82]Give me the melee weapon.
[39:33.97]Oh, it's the DPI.
[39:34.97]It's gonna be faster than this.
[39:37.31]That's actually better.
[39:38.19]No, it's not.
[39:39.09]I'm lying to myself.
[39:48.70]Hey, what?
[39:49.16]How did you see me?
[39:59.11]I can get these two.
[39:59.77]I can get guy with the door.
[40:00.75]Here we go.
[40:01.57]Guy with the door.
[40:04.37]Oops.
[40:06.79]Oops.
[40:12.61]Wait, wait.
[40:13.97]Okay.
[40:18.43]I need a melee weapon.
[40:19.26]Give me the knife.
[40:21.98]I gotta throw it at this guy's fucking head.
[40:27.77]That didn't kill him?
[40:30.30]You motherfucker!
[40:41.90]Fuck it, let's go.
[40:56.27]Who shot me from behind?
[40:59.36]Wait, somebody... Oh my god, what an idiot.
[41:02.68]My fists are instant kill with this character.
[41:04.51]Are you kidding me?
[41:17.85]Oh, the guy!
[41:18.31]The same guy!
[41:19.27]Oh my god!
[41:34.48]Where the fuck is he?
[41:35.14]Oh, shit.
[41:48.23]Can he see?
[41:48.61]No, he can't see through, right?
[42:07.97]Oh boy, my boy, oh boy.
[42:09.61]Okay.
[42:10.73]Secrets.
[42:17.63]That was fucking crazy.
[42:19.97]What a fucking fun game.
[42:21.49]What a wild game.
[42:22.85]I can't believe I missed this.
[42:24.32]This is like my favorite game of the year, and it's like ten years late.
[42:28.10]Uh oh, gotta do everything by myself, huh?
[42:33.94]Oh no.
[42:35.78]What?
[42:49.47]I gotta hide.
[42:49.93]Okay, gun.
[42:54.81]Alright, I'm getting flashbacks to the butcher in Diablo 1.
[42:59.36]It's actually scared right now.
[43:09.79]Oh my god, he's everywhere.
[43:16.85]Oh, break his neck.
[43:18.31]What?
[43:32.88]Oh, God, please... Please don't.
[43:38.46]Can I do anything here?
[43:43.74]Is this person okay?
[43:47.68]Can I save this person?
[43:50.34]Oh, well, I've just reached in his eyes.
[44:01.61]Oh, get, throw this.
[44:02.59]I don't want this, I don't want this equipped.
[44:08.15]Let's go.
[44:16.53]I did it.
[44:16.77]That was intense.
[44:34.99]Alright, what grade am I gonna get here?
[44:38.62]Just a C plus guy, aren't I?
[44:45.02]New mask, Don Juan.
[44:54.01]Hi there, welcome.
[44:54.69]Why is this guy every single employee in every store?
[44:57.15]You don't look well, sir.
[44:58.13]Are you alright?
[44:59.03]Are you sure it is okay for you to be drinking?
[45:00.87]Alright, then I'll get you something special.
[45:02.95]Do you like sweet or sour?
[45:05.45]Maybe you want it bitter.
[45:09.57]It's me again.
[45:10.37]Yeah, leather jacket.
[45:12.49]I was gonna say.
[45:13.17]Yeah.
[45:15.49]The resemblance is there, for sure.
[45:18.39]It's me again.
[45:22.47]And there you go, sir.
[45:23.35]Enjoy.
[45:26.76]No, it's me.
[45:27.66]Am I puking?
[45:34.01]I don't think I'm rushing these scenes too much.
[45:42.66]Is there other things to see in here?
[45:46.38]Apparently not, really.
[45:47.38]Alright, let's go.
[45:51.72]Next mission.
[45:55.91]I do like how they break it up, though.
[45:57.51]Because... I am like a rubber band ball right now.
[46:03.65]I'm in the center of it.
[46:09.48]Oh, it's you again.
[46:10.14]It looks like you've been busy since we last met.
[46:14.66]I see that you remember me now, don't you?
[46:16.92]But you still don't know who I am.
[46:18.36]You don't even know who introduced us, do you?
[46:22.25]Why did you come back here?
[46:24.06]You're not a nice person, are you?
[46:25.66]You make me sick.
[46:27.42]Split personality.
[46:28.86]It's me.
[46:29.62]I'm talking to myself.
[46:30.52]I wear the masks and I talk to myself.
[46:32.04]I already figured it out.
[46:33.68]The picture is starting to take form here.
[46:36.15]I wonder if it's accurate.
[46:37.17]Some pieces don't quite seem to fit.
[46:38.71]Maybe I just don't like the way it looks.
[46:45.63]I think our time is up, but we'll meet again.
[46:48.07]Before you go, here's our questions to ponder.
[46:50.45]Question number one.
[46:51.11]Do you like hurting other people?
[46:53.67]Question number two.
[46:54.94]Who are you leaving messages on your answering machine?
[46:59.34]Who are leaving messages on your answering machine?
[47:01.14]Question number three.
[47:02.24]Where are you right now?
[47:03.86]And the final question.
[47:04.68]Why are we having this conversation?
[47:14.50]He said the line?
[47:15.20]What do you mean the line?
[47:20.99]This is Blake speaking.
[47:21.89]We have a job for you.
[47:22.56]There's a power outage over on 24th.
[47:24.38]We want you to take care of it.
[47:26.34]We already sent someone over a while ago, but it seems he didn't do a very good job.
[47:30.44]Head over there right away.
[47:31.30]They're expecting you.
[47:32.62]Keep it quick and clean.
[47:41.10]I mean, like, guys, I don't know, this is like we're watching the prequels of Star Wars and Obi-Wan Kenobi is talking to Anakin.
[47:49.54]And spoilers, by the way, who cares?
[47:51.60]Star Wars, there's no such thing as a Star Wars spoiler.
[47:53.99]They have a whole ride based on this encounter at Disney World.
[47:59.47]And he says, alright, if you haven't just seen Star Wars yet, just fucking, you don't need to.
[48:07.33]What?
[48:07.93]Why am I so worried about that?
[48:09.98]When he screams, you're the chosen one.
[48:12.66]Right?
[48:13.86]If I've never seen that movie before, I don't know the line.
[48:16.02]I'm just like, oh, that was an interesting line.
[48:17.46]And then you sit next to me.
[48:18.66]You're like, oh, he said it.
[48:19.66]See?
[48:19.86]I'm just like, I don't know, man.
[48:23.25]Lethal doors.
[48:27.59]Let's try it.
[48:28.03]Alright, first try.
[48:41.01]What happened to the lethal doors?
[48:48.89]Am I missing something here?
[48:49.83]Alright, well anyways, fuck it Oh, you heard me!
[49:08.31]Where's that dog?
[49:11.03]What the fuck?
[49:22.68]How did I miss?
[49:23.71]How did I miss?
[49:41.05]Got them both.
[49:41.61]Double kill.
[49:47.10]Oh, no.
[49:59.79]Another Mike Peek.
[50:14.88]What happened to the lethal door?
[50:15.94]What happened to the lethal door?
[50:16.80]What happened to the lethal door?
[50:20.30]Give me another mask.
[50:31.18]Holy fuck, okay.
[50:34.20]Wait, I need a gun.
[50:45.02]Yeah, that works too.
[50:45.82]Okay, whatever.
[50:46.48]I don't give a shit.
[50:48.72]As long as it works.
[50:53.61]Is anybody up here?
[50:54.41]I can't see that far.
[50:56.77]No, I'm safe in here.
[51:15.93]Holy fuck, the guy behind me!
[51:19.33]My mouse couldn't move that- oh my god, I'm so mad.
[51:36.76]Dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, I need a gun.
[51:39.94]Do I have to use a gun on the dog?
[51:51.24]What the hell?
[51:52.72]Oh... Oh my god, this game is so hard.
[51:59.65]It's fucking so much fun, but holy shit.
[52:14.10]Holy fuck, kill him.
[52:21.36]This is the guy that opens this door.
[52:25.64]I gotta get the guys down here.
[52:26.92]Give me the melee weapon.
[52:29.40]I feel like I'm better with that than I am anything else.
[52:34.68]Alright.
[52:36.85]We got one.
[52:37.95]Two.
[52:38.17]Don't even count.
[52:38.81]Just go.
[52:41.09]You fucking dumb motherfucker.
[52:42.27]I swear to god.
[52:55.74]Oh my god.
[52:59.20]He's not dead.
[53:04.02]He is.
[53:30.17]Alright, lethal door.
[53:31.38]Let's lethal door this guy.
[53:35.46]That didn't seem very lethal.
[53:36.99]Oh, the fucking dog.
[53:58.86]Oh my god, I can't handle this.
[54:02.66]Oh my fucking lord.
[54:03.58]I really need to change masks.
[54:20.09]I was waiting for him.
[54:27.78]I gotta get these guys.
[54:29.30]The guy that comes out of the door here is the one that keeps killing me every time.
[54:38.00]I'm so nervous.
[54:41.26]Why did he turn around right there?
[54:42.92]God damn it.
[54:52.87]Give me a new mask.
[54:53.77]I'm not gonna use this thing.
[54:54.93]I can kill one guy with this door thing.
[54:59.47]You know what I mean?
[55:00.13]Like, I could get one guy with the fucking door killer in this level.
[55:04.31]Give me something else.
[55:08.32]Give me this thing.
[55:45.05]I gotta get in here.
[55:46.03]I think this is the only- I'm trying to think of the only way I can go.
[55:48.19]It's probably straight on, maybe?
[55:49.43]Around the corner?
[55:50.23]That guy's alive.
[55:55.46]Fuck.
[55:55.76]Oh my god.
[56:10.30]Oh my fucking god, you gotta be kidding me.
[56:12.70]How did he get blocked by the door twice?
[56:30.06]Let's get a gun.
[56:30.94]Nope.
[56:31.34]Okay.
[56:32.39]Gun.
[56:32.59]Give me a gun.
[56:33.31]Gun.
[56:33.95]Ah!
[56:38.31]Who's left?
[56:38.69]There's everybody left in this house.
[56:50.10]I'm scared to move.
[56:56.48]There's two guys with bats.
[56:59.16]Two guys in that room.
[56:59.90]Is the dog?
[57:00.58]The dog is gone, right?
[57:01.64]This only has five rounds.
[57:07.29]Okay, do it.
[57:09.45]I know you can do it.
[57:10.31]Do it.
[57:10.99]You can do it.
[57:12.15]Just shoot him.
[57:12.69]That's all you have to do.
[57:13.31]You have to go in the room and just get it lined up and shoot him.
[57:17.39]I fucking hate you.
[57:20.54]Okay, you're fine.
[57:21.00]I like you again.
[57:27.62]No, I need melee.
[57:38.37]These are the last few guys here.
[57:40.21]Wait till he's at the door, and then just rush him.
[57:42.47]One, two, three.
[57:44.69]Oh my fucking god.
[57:45.80]Mom!
[57:46.12]Mom!
[57:46.42]Okay, I'm good.
[57:57.46]What the fuck?
[57:59.80]What happened to my DPI?
[58:01.52]I pressed the fucking button on my Razor Death Adder.
[58:04.94]Okay, there we go.
[58:24.77]Get the guy at the door.
[58:28.64]He's gonna go all the way around, right?
[58:36.75]Holy shit, that guy didn't shoot me.
[58:38.19]What?
[58:38.79]I hit the button again.
[58:41.49]I did it again.
[58:57.75]I gotta keep, I gotta wait like a second before the fucking door opens.
[59:07.39]That's it.
[59:07.80]Last, last guy down here.
[59:09.32]There's two people hanging out in here.
[59:12.42]Two dudes in here.
[59:15.76]I think, I have to go.
[59:16.94]I'm going from the back.
[59:22.34]Give me the pool cue.
[59:23.87]Alright.
[59:24.89]I'm gonna throw.
[59:26.33]What's this guy attached to?
[59:32.61]That guy's a gun.
[59:33.15]I have to go around.
[59:34.55]How am I gonna do this?
[59:54.38]What the fuck was that?
[60:05.01]I don't understand.
[60:05.71]What the fuck happened?
[60:07.49]I know the bomb is rigged to the door.
[60:09.99]Okay.
[60:20.13]Well, that was unnecessary, but whatever.
[60:23.28]One guy here.
[60:24.98]No bullets in that thing.
[60:26.04]Okay.
[60:30.82]I can't use either.
[60:31.44]I gotta go.
[60:31.98]How do I get in there?
[60:36.18]Can I go through, like, the bathroom?
[60:42.42]There's only two ways to get in there.
[60:44.06]How do I def- how do I disarm the bomb?
[60:49.50]Just shoot the door, but if I shoot- am I gonna- I'll kill the guy in here.
[60:52.22]Don't I want to save this guy?
[60:56.30]Can I, like, do this?
[60:56.92]No.
[61:17.23]Can I get... hold on.
[61:30.92]Doesn't matter who they are, all that matters is you kill them.
[61:34.78]Can I... I can't like shoot through anything.
[61:44.67]Shoot the door.
[61:45.29]I just did that!
[61:46.05]Look!
[61:47.33]What are you talking about?
[61:48.17]I don't have any bullets!
[61:54.01]What?
[61:54.43]What?
[62:07.45]So wait, how am I supposed to know that I had to shoot it with different bullets for it to explode?
[62:12.44]Come on.
[62:13.98]Oh fuck, those guys are gonna kill me.
[62:17.57]I knew it.
[62:18.07]I fucking knew it.
[62:19.02]Oh my god.
[63:13.33]Okay.
[63:13.95]Shoot door.
[63:14.81]Shoot door.
[63:15.65]Shoot door.
[63:22.84]How do I deal with you idiots?
[63:29.70]You're behind cover.
[63:31.12]Hmm.
[63:31.44]Hmm.
[63:32.22]Hmm.
[63:43.62]Okay, so, um, hmm... I don't know.
[63:49.93]Well... Defuse the bomb.
[63:53.72]I can't defuse the bomb.
[64:13.70]Fuck me.
[64:14.85]They stand up before they shoot.
[64:16.67]Fucking hell.
[64:21.29]I need to get the guy with the gun.
[64:34.50]Oh my god, I just want it to be done.
[64:36.08]I'm trying to go so fast because I don't want to do it again.
[64:47.33]Where did he go with that gun?
[64:49.65]Where'd he go?
[64:50.51]He goes in this room?
[64:51.33]What?
[65:11.17]Why did he even go in there?
[65:12.15]That's the first time he's ever gone in there.
[65:13.49]Like 30 attempts.
[65:15.75]For real.
[65:26.15]I did.
[65:26.51]That didn't kill him.
[65:27.14]I hit him with the door, apparently.
[65:28.62]Why did that not hurt him?
[65:31.76]Why did it hurt him the first time?
[65:59.63]Okay.
[66:00.15]Now, let's blow up the door.
[66:03.09]Alright.
[66:03.69]Now, give me... Do I have a gun?
[66:06.73]I have... Here's a rifle.
[66:08.80]They stand up before they shoot.
[66:10.46]But I feel like the guy down here is shooting me before this guy does.
[66:14.38]And I can't see this guy.
[66:15.50]So let's keep zoomed in.
[66:17.04]Holy fuck.
[66:19.76]Okay.
[66:24.69]Oh my lord in heaven.
[66:30.45]He stood up first.
[66:31.31]Alright, we're fine.
[66:32.05]Everything's good.
[66:42.94]That's too much.
[66:43.70]That's too much for my puny brain to handle.
[66:59.22]I'm definitely gonna get a bad grade here.
[67:07.06]No, that's fine.
[67:07.88]I'm okay with that.
[67:09.78]Uh, $50 just came in.
[67:14.27]From Peanut Chan.
[67:15.91]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[67:18.70]Hey Jerma, your content got me through the stresses of college.
[67:20.84]I was lucky enough to get a nice job when I got out, so I want to pay you back now that I can afford it.
[67:26.66]I'm sure you'll pay me back when you spend it on something crazy to make me laugh and forget about the challenges of everyday life.
[67:32.72]Jerma Hart, Transgender Pride, have fun with this amazing game.
[67:37.07]Absolutely, thank you.
[67:39.91]Thank you, Peanut Chen, for your 50 bucks.
[67:45.09]And... congratulations, obviously.
[67:49.80]On getting through college, getting a job.
[67:56.20]Thank you so much.
[67:58.08]It means a lot.
[68:09.87]Graham is the bunny.
[68:15.89]Glass bottle.
[68:16.47]That's the one I'm fucking talking about.
[68:22.66]Yeah, trans, trans, transgender pride is the emote, right?
[68:37.17]Yes, okay.
[68:39.03]What are these guys doing out here?
[68:43.76]Should I be worried about this?
[68:50.46]Who the fuck, who the fuck is this?
[68:55.02]Alright, well, we can... Hey, something bad's going on outside your store, man.
[68:59.42]Oh, hi there, good to see you again.
[69:05.80]I was a bit worried about you.
[69:07.48]The city streets don't seem so safe anymore, you know?
[69:09.88]With all the killings and all that.
[69:11.68]Don't worry about paying, you're my friend.
[69:13.16]Your money's no good here, now have a nice night.
[69:21.96]Do I just go in every day to this door and the guy's like, hey, yeah, here.
[69:27.00]Want a stereo or something?
[69:33.30]Oh, wow, I forgot, by the way.
[69:35.74]I installed it and everything and... I completely fucking forgot about it.
[69:39.70]I just dropped a shitload of frames there.
[69:48.34]I installed Fortnite and made an account on Fortnite.
[69:54.17]And the joke was I was gonna do a... play a round of Fortnite every time I died in this game.
[70:02.16]I'm so glad I did not think that that was funny after installing it and doing it on setting everything up.
[70:09.35]Okay.
[70:15.12]That's Dave from Miami Pest Control.
[70:17.04]We need you.
[70:18.12]How many times have I died so far?
[70:41.23]Imagine playing, like, a hundred games of Fortnite and I've never played it before.
[70:46.42]This is called Full House.
[70:50.46]Be fast and efficient.
[70:51.42]Alright, who we got?
[70:56.12]Lethal Doors.
[70:56.70]Walk fast.
[71:02.43]This is for speedrunners.
[71:04.01]I don't know if I'm in that category.
[71:12.19]Ooh, that's a dog, dog, dog.
[71:13.37]Can't punch the dog.
[71:18.23]What am I doing?
[71:18.85]Pick it up.
[71:19.37]What?
[71:19.49]It's a knife!
[71:24.48]Holy shit, how am I still alive?
[71:26.00]I have no idea.
[71:34.93]I just threw it.
[71:35.81]What am I doing?
[71:39.03]This is the sloppiest fucking time I've played.
[71:41.83]And somehow I'm still a living.
[71:45.63]Gotta get this guy in the door here.
[71:55.64]Still a dog alive, gotta be worried about that.
[71:57.22]You gonna come up here, dog?
[72:06.02]Holy fuck, it missed.
[72:07.57]Just barely missed.
[72:08.71]Oh no.
[72:13.19]I tried!
[72:13.77]I tried!
[72:14.45]I tried to fucking break his neck and it wouldn't do it!
[72:17.96]Oh, I was like standing over his body for so long for no reason.
[72:45.86]Ah!
[72:52.90]Did it not kill him in one hit?
[72:54.02]What in the name of God just happened there?
[72:58.65]Almost done.
[72:59.99]Give me the pool cue, it's bigger.
[73:02.63]Okay, just the guy in the kitchen.
[73:08.73]Does the guy come out?
[73:11.01]I don't think this guy comes out.
[73:15.09]Oh, and okay, you gotta explain to me what the fuck is with the turnaround there.
[73:18.71]What's with the turnaround?
[73:20.15]Why did he turn around?
[73:21.03]You gotta explain what's with the turnaround there.
[73:22.65]Why did he turn around?
[73:23.27]What's with the turnaround?
[73:23.85]What happened?
[73:24.13]Why did he turn around there?
[73:40.49]Why did that happen?
[73:43.19]Why did that happen?
[73:43.99]I'm still reeling over why the fuck that happened.
[74:08.50]Still a dog.
[74:10.05]Alright, two guys in here.
[74:12.29]Oh, what happened to me?
[74:14.73]I don't know.
[74:15.07]I don't know what to do here.
[74:15.97]I just keep annoying this guy.
[74:37.76]Give me a fucking break.
[74:40.14]Damn it.
[75:07.94]Same deal.
[75:08.72]Don't have that happen again.
[75:09.70]I gotta throw this shit at him.
[75:21.02]Alright.
[75:22.44]Melee.
[75:22.76]Two guys with melee.
[75:23.60]Two guys with guns.
[75:24.32]I gotta go in there with a gun.
[75:26.67]I gotta go in there.
[75:27.39]I've gotta knock one guy down.
[75:29.45]Shoot guy in front of me.
[75:30.95]Play it cool for a second here.
[75:33.75]So, knock out guy.
[75:34.83]Shoot guy.
[75:35.57]Guy comes around.
[75:36.31]Got it.
[75:37.78]This guy right here is the one who's going to get shot.
[75:41.64]One, two, three.
[75:43.30]I don't even know how I went through.
[75:44.48]I went through the door.
[75:45.48]I went through the door.
[75:47.04]That's not what was part of the plan, Jeremy.
[75:48.98]I didn't want to go through the fucking door.
[76:02.45]That wasn't the plan.
[76:10.17]Holy fuck, and he turned around all the far away.
[76:11.97]That was so far away.
[76:12.95]You know what?
[76:13.27]Fuck the plan.
[76:14.55]I'll give you a plan.
[76:34.09]I'll give you a fucking plan.
[76:39.15]How did you turn on me that quickly?
[76:41.13]Fuck you!
[76:42.65]Come on!
[76:44.07]How?
[76:45.73]Through the fucking door!
[77:02.61]Fuck the plant!
[77:10.15]Did I kill one person?
[77:11.07]I just tried to... I ran out of bullets and I fucking ran out of bullets.
[77:24.02]Oh, I'm so fucking... I'm so...
[78:10.80]don't have a plan.
[78:12.80]Forget about a plan.
[78:17.69]Fuck the plan.
[78:18.95]Again, it works.
[78:21.67]Fuck the plan.
[78:25.77]Alright, let's go.
[78:32.59]Fuck the plan.
[78:38.49]Oh, somebody was sitting there.
[78:57.36]That guy's still alive.
[79:12.15]What does that item do?
[79:13.31]What does that item even do?
[79:15.09]What the fuck item did I pick up?
[79:17.17]I was trying to melee.
[79:18.25]What the fuck did I just pick up off the ground?
[79:20.97]What did I pick up?
[79:22.65]A glass bottle.
[79:26.15]If you can see my face right now, my fucking teeth are showing.
[79:28.94]Am I like mo- I look like a dog.
[80:17.66]One guy in here.
[80:18.30]I got... This guy was easy last time.
[80:19.74]Wasn't a problem.
[80:22.52]Here come the other two guys.
[80:23.38]No, they didn't hear it.
[80:26.29]One, two... A guy over here is definitely going to be more of a problem than this guy.
[80:29.75]For sure.
[80:31.39]And I missed.
[80:31.77]I...
[80:40.87]We're good.
[80:48.50]This is fucking crazy.
[80:50.85]Oh, this game is so much fun!
[80:53.17]But I- I like hate it.
[81:10.53]I love it, though.
[81:17.99]Damn it.
[81:18.63]I thought that was a B-.
[81:22.74]No, I hate it.
[81:25.54]I got Dennis.
[81:29.12]Yeah, don't... I'm never picking up... Okay, that's probably a good gun.
[81:32.26]But I'm never picking up that stupid bottle.
[81:42.03]Good evening, how are you doing?
[81:42.83]You look a bit distracted.
[81:45.15]Something got you worried.
[81:45.99]These are harsh times we're living in, I know.
[81:48.49]Haven't seen many customers lately.
[81:50.11]Maybe they've lost their taste for pizza.
[81:52.71]Maybe it's time to close shop once and for all.
[81:54.93]Anyway, got your order right here.
[81:57.19]Take care.
[82:00.74]What is going on in this game?
[82:09.94]Bottle gets you execution points?
[82:12.69]That would make a lot of sense.
[82:13.66]Okay.
[82:42.73]Wait, what?
[82:43.82]What?
[82:44.06]I just skipped the dialog sequence with this guy.
[82:47.94]How?
[82:48.34]I just, like, accidentally clicked.
[82:49.54]I thought I had to click on him.
[82:50.72]What did he say?
[82:58.15]It just says, go back.
[83:00.33]I'm gonna restart.
[83:02.63]Check the VOD.
[83:05.05]This one's called Clean Hit.
[83:07.31]Tip, you can throw weapons.
[83:08.71]Alright, so let's see.
[83:10.93]You start with a knife with Dennis.
[83:12.63]Let's try it.
[83:15.69]Alright, guy in the toilet.
[83:17.61]Room full of weapons.
[83:18.65]Guy in the toilet.
[83:19.31]Guy in the toilet it is.
[83:20.23]I don't think I even want to use those right now.
[83:27.24]Although there are a shitload of people in here.
[83:29.66]This is, yeah, how the fuck am I supposed to, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[83:41.87]I think this is like a turtle mission, isn't it?
[83:44.93]Are the waiters, are the waiters gonna pull out guns?
[83:49.67]Of course they are.
[83:53.04]Of course the fucking waiter is gonna pull out a gun.
[83:57.69]No, I wanted to... Holy shit, okay.
[84:00.95]Alright, I gotta be really careful here.
[84:13.89]All the way in the back.
[84:15.77]Up top.
[84:16.67]Guy in the back has a good shot.
[84:22.23]Okay.
[84:23.85]Last guy over here.
[84:25.57]Can I just cheese him?
[84:27.09]Oh, of course I can.
[84:29.81]Stage clear.
[84:30.37]Let's go.
[84:33.39]Anywhere else?
[84:33.97]Nothing else?
[84:34.77]I'm gonna make sure I have a weapon up here.
[84:40.68]Anybody right out the front door?
[84:41.66]Are we sure about this?
[84:47.98]Whoa!
[84:48.80]Okay.
[84:49.54]Where the hell did you come from?
[84:53.38]Oh fuck, okay, you're just down there.
[85:02.19]So what's... What's this trying to tell me?
[85:08.57]Oh.
[85:21.01]Okay.
[85:22.29]Hi.
[85:22.35]Nice to meet you.
[85:23.75]What about this window?
[85:39.56]Can I open this window?
[85:48.93]I can't open the window.
[86:00.71]There's nobody else in this room, so I think I'm alright to walk over here.
[86:03.63]This is gonna be very, very hard.
[86:10.42]I gotta be prepared for this.
[86:11.62]I don't... Okay, here we go.
[86:13.00]One, two, three.
[86:13.96]I gotta get, like, two people in one shot.
[86:15.32]One, two, three, go!
[86:15.86]Wow!
[86:36.02]What's going on?
[86:44.08]Okay, well... What is this floating?
[86:50.50]Oh, it's... Is there anything else in here that I need to see?
[86:57.83]I feel like I'm gonna be missing a lot of secrets if I just blast through.
[87:01.05]So give me one second.
[87:07.20]Nothin'.
[87:07.48]I mean, what about the janitor?
[87:16.47]No.
[87:21.51]No secrets.
[87:32.88]Whatever, I'm gonna miss the secret.
[87:33.96]It's my first playthrough.
[87:39.90]Did I actually miss a secret?
[87:41.04]I feel like I'm going to get a fairly good score on this one.
[87:42.74]I only died like two or three times.
[87:45.66]Right?
[87:50.70]That's probably going to be... Alright.
[87:52.62]I'll take it.
[87:52.98]That's fine.
[87:57.58]Dying doesn't matter.
[87:58.54]Okay.
[88:00.38]George the Giraffe.
[88:03.89]I played this game three times and I've never found a secret.
[88:06.25]There we go.
[88:08.89]This guy again.
[88:11.21]Hey, man!
[88:12.65]Boy, am I glad to see you.
[88:13.67]Have you been following the news about the killings?
[88:17.07]Now, this is top secret.
[88:18.11]You can't tell anyone.
[88:19.43]But I have a friend who's in the police force.
[88:21.64]He told me there's rumors going around.
[88:24.08]There could be more than one perp.
[88:25.90]Maybe a whole bunch.
[88:27.32]A group of people wearing masks killing Russians.
[88:30.80]It's like it's from a movie or something, right?
[88:33.28]Well, I think it's fascinating, right?
[88:35.14]So just grab any movie you want.
[88:36.86]It's on the house.
[88:41.30]Okay, I want this one.
[88:45.26]No, any movie and I have to take this?
[88:47.00]I have to take that movie?
[89:01.35]So we're now what?
[89:02.23]A little more than a month and a half from the start of the game?
[89:05.71]April, right?
[89:10.30]This girl is still here.
[89:17.23]Harry, from management, we have a problem.
[89:19.15]This big mess over by the condos on 122nd S.E.
[89:23.37]Street.
[89:24.67]One of the president's... One of the residents' water pipe burst.
[89:29.46]Wet all over.
[89:30.72]The whole building is gonna be flooded soon.
[89:33.00]Hope you can get on this shit as soon as possible.
[89:35.52]Don't go easy on the mob, quick.
[89:41.61]Don't worry.
[89:41.99]I'm not going to go easy.
[89:51.10]Neighbors.
[89:55.02]Start with a knife.
[89:55.86]Look further.
[89:57.82]Alright, George.
[89:58.47]That sounds... Well, George is the best item in the game.
[90:02.89]I mean, that's the best item in the whole game.
[90:06.07]In my honest opinion.
[90:12.56]Got two guys with guns.
[90:14.16]There's a broom right there.
[90:15.54]Alright, that's my opportunity to... I could probably sneak in... Alright, sneak in here.
[90:21.80]Yeah.
[90:22.72]Sneak in here, punch this guy, kill guy, take on, shoot guy.
[90:25.92]One, two, three, action.
[90:38.05]Nice and fucking clean.
[90:40.43]What?
[90:40.83]Oh, that guy...
[90:48.14]Okay, I gotta turn around and punch that guy.
[90:56.60]Alright, don't use the gun.
[91:01.25]I don't think I need to.
[91:05.77]Actually, I think I have to shoot, don't I?
[91:07.45]Maybe not.
[91:12.98]Oh, fuck.
[91:13.98]Mistake.
[91:16.48]Ah, shit.
[91:36.34]Fuck, is that guy still alive?
[91:37.30]Don't give me this thing.
[91:42.97]No more bullets in this thing, give me-
[92:11.16]Alright, let's go!
[92:12.02]Let's go!
[92:12.38]Let's go!
[92:12.68]I'm doing it!
[92:17.78]Secret!
[92:23.42]Ooh.
[92:24.74]That's a new gun.
[92:25.46]Is this my first playthrough?
[92:29.86]Yes, it is.
[92:30.76]It's the first time I've ever played the game.
[92:35.96]Alright, we got one dog.
[92:37.45]There's more than... No, there's only one dog.
[92:40.66]Two guys at the front door.
[92:46.67]Holy fucking hell.
[92:49.67]Oh, I thought that was a door.
[92:50.65]Shit.
[92:53.93]Fuck, dog.
[92:57.95]Fuck.
[92:58.40]I should have backed up.
[93:10.69]No, fuck.
[93:16.80]I got one bullet.
[93:22.30]Fucking DPI on the Razor Death Adder.
[93:24.22]Please.
[93:46.26]What do we got?
[93:47.57]Alright, here we go.
[93:49.87]I have to shoot this guy.
[93:50.73]I can't fuck this up.
[93:52.75]Alright, easy.
[93:53.79]That door's closed.
[93:54.67]Here's this guy.
[93:55.39]One, two, three.
[93:56.11]Got him.
[93:58.77]Last guy.
[93:59.19]Alright, good.
[94:03.30]Anything else?
[94:03.70]Uh, we're gonna go with the... No, I'm going with at least three rounds on this shotgun here.
[94:18.80]We got one, two, three, four.
[94:20.85]I think I can get them all ready.
[94:21.79]Here we go.
[94:22.27]One, two, three, action.
[94:34.72]Oh my god, I was trying to fuck.
[94:36.00]Oh, I'm trying to pick up the gun on the ground.
[94:45.29]Motherfucker.
[94:52.98]What the hell?!
[94:58.38]What happened there?!
[95:13.07]What are you gonna- honestly, did he not die from being shot by the gun?
[95:17.44]What the fuck was that?
[95:18.94]Oops.
[95:19.92]Oops.
[95:20.78]I'm going all the way out.
[95:22.50]Okay.
[95:28.64]Wait, what?
[95:29.44]Oh, that's it.
[95:30.00]I beat it.
[95:35.66]Yeah, so wait.
[95:36.80]You shot a door and the door knocked the guy down so he didn't die.
[95:39.18]Oh, well, fuck.
[95:41.24]Is there any secrets?
[95:57.36]Okay, am I losing my mind right now?
[96:00.75]What is going on?
[96:25.92]Last guy.
[96:27.22]Make it quick.
[96:27.78]Make it easy.
[96:33.70]Phone's ringing.
[96:38.21]There's been a small change of plans.
[96:39.77]We have a prank caller at the telephone company.
[96:44.39]Why don't you go there and see if you can talk some sense with him.
[96:47.51]You know what I mean.
[96:49.44]Go there now.
[96:50.36]Floor it.
[96:50.74]Okay.
[96:52.80]Can I have a...
[97:11.08]Oh, wait, we're not done.
[97:12.00]We're just going.
[97:13.84]Uh-oh.
[97:16.54]Phone mom.
[97:25.31]Okay.
[97:25.87]Is there any items on the ground?
[97:28.53]Can I go in there with a weapon?
[97:29.51]Is this a boss or something?
[97:38.77]Uh...
[97:40.63]They want me to get the giant Mega Man gun.
[97:44.01]That's like a giant machine gun.
[97:45.89]Okay, how am I gonna hold that?
[97:56.79]Hello?
[97:59.25]You're dead meat.
[98:01.97]Alright, give me the gun.
[98:03.99]What the fuck?
[98:14.62]It's not a gun.
[98:17.08]In fact, it's a set of golf clubs.
[98:26.25]Oh my god.
[98:33.47]Oh my god.
[98:34.11]I need a fucking golf club.
[98:36.95]What is this?
[98:44.54]I understand.
[98:45.00]You gotta go after him right after he swings.
[98:48.62]Oh, but I fucking got cornered.
[99:12.53]Whoa!
[99:13.33]Oh shit!
[99:13.77]Oh shit!
[99:14.61]I got him!
[99:15.07]I beat him!
[99:15.99]No I didn't.
[99:16.49]What am I thinking?
[99:16.95]I'm so fucking nervous.
[99:37.05]Why did it not lock onto him?
[99:38.29]Okay, do it again.
[99:48.53]What's with the fucking corner there?
[99:50.35]What?
[99:50.55]He spins around you!
[99:51.69]Why was he just walking with me?
[99:54.31]Ugh.
[99:58.38]That throwing just went phase through his body.
[100:13.45]Holy fuck.
[100:19.89]Throw it!
[100:24.39]This can't be happening.
[100:28.11]It can't end now, not like this.
[100:31.65]I'm so close.
[100:41.96]Holy shit, okay.
[100:46.12]Welp.
[100:48.68]I did it.
[100:55.99]It was only two hits.
[100:59.03]That was anxiety-causing.
[101:12.40]Ow.
[101:14.10]You don't even know what you did.
[101:18.55]116 total deaths.
[101:23.31]That seems like a lot.
[101:25.75]Alright, so what's a typical total deaths for an entire playthrough, for a first try?
[101:31.03]I got Ted.
[101:38.01]About 15.
[101:38.61]Interesting.
[101:44.86]Machete.
[101:51.28]We really should be playing Fortnite now.
[101:54.12]No, we shouldn't.
[101:57.39]I even installed it, too.
[101:58.57]What the hell?
[101:59.05]Why would I even do that?
[101:59.85]What a waste of internet.
[102:02.88]I'm not even gonna do it.
[102:03.74]I'm never gonna play it.
[102:04.66]I'm just gonna uninstall it.
[102:05.56]Welcome back, sir.
[102:06.54]How are you tonight?
[102:07.26]You don't look so happy.
[102:08.28]To be honest, I don't feel too good either.
[102:10.28]Something in the air.
[102:11.10]I don't know.
[102:12.72]I just have this really bad feeling like something terrible has happened tonight.
[102:16.66]I haven't felt this way since San Francisco.
[102:18.72]I don't like it, but not one bit.
[102:20.75]So how about a drink?
[102:26.43]Yeah, before the stream started, we were joking in the chat.
[102:32.23]Saying things like, if I turn on Fortnite, even as a joke, I will lose probably 1,500 viewers.
[102:39.94]And then the argument was made, but what about the potential 3,000 or 4,000 that you'll gain?
[102:44.30]And I don't even know what to do about that.
[102:47.48]I don't think I would want that to happen.
[102:57.32]think I want that.
[103:03.50]So, you came back.
[103:05.46]How are you feeling?
[103:06.22]You look ill.
[103:06.78]Maybe you should see a doctor.
[103:09.76]I told you not to come back here.
[103:11.12]I see that my opinion of you doesn't matter.
[103:13.86]If you insist on returning here, then I should leave.
[103:15.94]Have you thought about what I asked you last time?
[103:19.06]I'm not here to give you any answers.
[103:21.12]Questions are all I have to offer a man like you.
[103:24.82]If you're not feeling well, maybe you should rest.
[103:27.42]Some things work out best when you don't try so hard.
[103:30.46]No matter who you are, bearing too much weight inevitably leads to the collapse of everything.
[103:36.43]Next time we meet will be the last.
[103:42.03]I can see it in your eyes.
[103:43.59]Before you go, I'll leave you with three predictions.
[103:47.65]Someone you know is not who you think he is.
[103:50.24]Something will soon be taken from you.
[103:52.88]On July the 21st, you will wake up in a bigger house.
[103:59.32]Okay.
[104:08.24]Alright, where's, um... Let's just go.
[104:12.60]Hi, it's Pat from the club.
[104:13.72]We want you to DJ tonight.
[104:15.06]You're free to play any kind of music you want.
[104:17.22]Beer is on the house.
[104:19.48]Dressed to kill.
[104:20.22]See ya.
[104:20.98]Click.
[104:30.97]Why why is she wearing the matching colors of the Nintendo?
[104:37.89]That's such like a that's such like a streamer thing to do And I mean like look I'm wearing the colors of the thing that's in my room I
[104:54.10]Like, imagine if my character was dressed up in, like, this color scheme and there was a webcam on me.
[105:06.00]Drink from the sink?
[105:09.95]What?
[105:24.30]Push it!
[105:27.12]Jerma would do that if he had the foresight.
[105:29.00]S5 probably would.
[105:29.64]Dogs don't attack.
[105:30.70]Yup.
[105:32.39]I don't give a shit.
[105:33.03]Well, why would there be dogs here?
[105:35.03]Oh, there are dogs here.
[105:46.62]So the dogs don't do anything.
[105:47.84]That's... Okay, I might have to keep that on permanently.
[105:53.67]Holy fuck, where did you?
[105:55.57]Okay.
[105:57.03]Through the glass, apparently.
[105:58.55]Yeah, that's what we call a fucking triple.
[106:06.87]That's what we call getting it done.
[106:23.73]Only one more guy down here He's got a knife
[106:43.35]Who's left?
[106:45.99]Is somebody left?
[106:46.61]Who's left?
[106:47.11]Wait, I have to... I have to kill the dogs even though they're friendly?
[107:02.42]Oh boy, okay.
[107:03.54]That's not very nice.
[107:10.06]I have the special dog mask on.
[107:12.84]Rain gun.
[107:18.05]Alright, I'm gonna go left.
[107:20.17]Left room is more dangerous, I think, in my personal opinion.
[107:32.04]Why is a dog coming over here?
[107:37.07]No bullets, no bullets, no bullets.
[107:41.07]Fuck.
[107:46.63]Oh, you fucking... There was another guy pretending to be dead on the ground.
[107:49.11]Give me a break.
[107:57.13]What am I doing?
[107:58.61]What?
[107:59.73]How did I do that?
[108:05.34]That just threw me off What the hell am I doing?
[108:13.87]Watch out, watch out, watch out, he's gonna come in here
[108:46.08]Why did you stop throwing them?
[108:48.78]Oh, fuck me, man.
[108:50.35]Can I pick it up?
[108:53.55]Get them both.
[108:54.05]One, two, three.
[109:00.90]I didn't... I thought it was just the dogs left.
[109:02.98]I thought it was just the dogs.
[109:04.20]That's why I ran through there.
[109:05.52]Oh, man.
[109:06.36]I'm so... God.
[109:19.16]I just thought the dogs were left.
[109:27.17]Give me a fucking break.
[109:28.09]He was locked on too.
[109:29.43]Unbelievable.
[109:29.91]No, I don't want to pick the guy up.
[109:34.66]Just get rid of the dogs now so I don't have to think about this later.
[109:38.14]Why was he not dead?
[109:52.98]I'm not gonna forget about that guy now.
[109:54.98]Come here.
[110:08.13]Who's left?
[110:09.03]One guy, right there.
[110:10.23]Bingo.
[110:10.77]One, two, three.
[110:16.89]Let's go.
[110:19.28]That dog wasn't there.
[110:20.50]I thought the dog wasn't there.
[110:22.36]I thought it was just the dogs.
[110:24.10]Is that it?
[110:39.71]Well, we both had the same idea apparently.
[110:58.20]Get off of him!
[110:58.74]Alright, is there a way that I can jump off somebody?
[111:02.65]Hey, guess what I did?
[111:12.35]I hit the fucking DPI button on the mouse again.
[111:36.11]Fuck this.
[111:36.91]Alright, I'm... Can you disable it?
[111:42.46]I think I have to download the... the, like, virus software to disable that, don't I?
[111:48.47]Don't I have to get, like, Razer's virus shitty synapse program thing to do that?
[112:04.73]Just turn it off, you nuts.
[112:06.38]Alright, that's it over here.
[112:12.36]Two guys down there.
[112:13.14]Nope, a guy in the bathroom.
[112:17.56]I wanna go in there with the super shotgun.
[112:20.25]Nobody on the DJ floor?
[112:21.17]Okay.
[112:21.33]Let's go.
[112:24.85]Just solder it.
[112:26.57]Holy fuck, I was talking and I almost just ran into death.
[112:46.70]Go to the car.
[112:51.87]Wait, did I just go back up the stairs?
[112:55.21]I did, didn't I?
[112:56.49]Fuck me.
[113:10.83]Mask, mask, but... I def... I def... Whatever.
[113:18.94]I didn't pick up the mask, but... Read chat.
[113:23.64]Alright, let me tell you something.
[113:25.30]When I'm in the middle of an insane game where you have to focus 1000%, I can't look over here.
[113:31.43]I can look over here like now.
[113:48.28]Level was over.
[113:49.46]Who cares?
[113:50.93]That mask sucks anyways.
[114:03.81]How do I know?
[114:05.95]It's easy.
[114:06.71]Because Leather Jacket just told me and he's in the game.
[114:09.58]He's right here.
[114:24.45]Shit, that's bad What you just saw now did not actually happen you don't even you don't look like you believe me then allow me to demonstrate Hey, man, nice to see you friendly faces are few and far between these days.
[114:45.30]Just take what you want my treat.
[114:47.46]Have a good night Am I living in a simulation?
[114:54.81]I think this is a weird simulation game.
[114:56.45]We have one new message.
[115:10.81]Hi, this is Rick from the real estate office.
[115:12.76]This is showing for an apartment downtown today.
[115:15.50]It's at Southwest Street, 35, open house.
[115:18.78]Just swing on by when you have the time.
[115:28.38]Get the mask.
[115:31.19]I'm not gonna get the mask.
[115:33.11]It doesn't matter.
[115:34.03]I'm just playing the game.
[115:37.47]I'm not gonna peek my microphone.
[115:43.16]Survive one bullet.
[115:45.62]I kind of like the dog zone attack thing though.
[115:52.53]Walk fast, lethal doors, more guns, Fists of Fury.
[115:55.63]I like this one, let's try this one again.
[116:09.21]Holy shit, two guys!
[116:11.03]And a dog!
[116:11.91]Whoa!
[116:13.31]Alright, we're fine.
[116:13.89]There's only one guy left in this room, but he has a gun.
[116:19.30]Make it count.
[116:19.72]Make it count.
[116:20.08]1, 2, 3.
[116:20.74]Oh my fucking god.
[116:22.18]You didn't make it count.
[116:23.12]You didn't do it.
[116:23.78]Oh my lord.
[116:47.42]Man, the dog's not attacking thing is seriously so good.
[116:50.51]It's so good.
[116:51.19]I don't even want to pick up a melee weapon because I'm gonna... I kill instantly.
[117:00.45]But... I mean, we'll bait that guy over here.
[117:06.72]Dogs are so erratic.
[117:13.71]I thought the other guy died and they didn't have a gun.
[117:15.03]Fuck.
[117:24.47]Try a different approach.
[117:25.15]I had it.
[117:28.33]I can get it.
[117:29.15]Alright, now... What the fuck am I going to do about this?
[117:38.68]Pool kill.
[117:44.96]I gotta... If I poke my head in here, I'm dead.
[117:46.86]I gotta be careful.
[117:47.48]Because he's just facing this way.

[120:49.41]That guy has a laser.
[120:50.21]What am I supposed to do about this?
[120:54.63]Um.

[121:09.34]That sucks.
[121:18.21]I'm actually defeated.
[121:19.87]I feel terrible right now.
[121:32.82]How did you pick that up, you fucking idiot?
[121:41.58]Wait, I'm just trying to rush it now.

[123:46.65]What the hell happened to my body, my brain?
[123:48.43]No!
[124:03.69]No!
[124:05.61]No!
[124:08.15]I don't, why do I have to do this whole thing again?
[124:12.30]You give such great checkpoints, and then all of a sudden, like, the fucking entire police force shows up, and you just have to start the whole thing over.
[124:18.39]Fuck.
[124:31.58]I'm losing it now.
[124:32.66]I'm, like, just exhausted.
[124:38.72]Fucking hell.
[124:46.75]Fuck the gun.
[124:49.97]There's no more bullets in that fucking thing.
[125:09.14]Dogs.
[125:11.12]No, no, time to leave, right?
[125:12.52]The police are here, right?
[125:15.69]How do I get out of here?
[125:16.35]Where's the exit?
[125:17.33]But where's the exit though?
[125:18.21]I don't know where the fucking exit is.
[125:20.77]Oh my God.
[125:21.87]Why does this exist?
[125:24.44]Holy shit.
[125:25.04]I actually made a checkpoint.
[125:31.78]Oh my God.
[125:32.54]I actually made a checkpoint by leaving the fucking room.
[125:36.00]Oh.
[125:45.89]Oh my goodness gracious, that was fucking too much.
[125:52.05]Calm down?
[125:52.73]How are you supposed to calm down?
[125:54.71]Where I... I would have had, in my brain, I'm starting the entire level over again if I lose there.
[126:03.42]Hey, dude, calm down!
[126:05.76]You almost just had to do the whole thing over again after doing it.
[126:21.04]Why did my chat is gone?
[126:23.02]Okay, it makes perfect sense I don't know why that happened Hey, what do you want?
[126:45.77]I know our friend is looks like he's dead over there.
[126:48.52]Oh
[126:50.85]Could you hurry up?
[126:51.45]We're closing soon.
[126:52.25]I usually get shit here for free.
[126:57.43]Is that not a thing anymore?
[126:58.27]I'm gonna have to throw a flag on that round.
[127:07.89]Come on, that was fucking hard.
[127:09.89]That was no joke.
[127:17.58]Anything else to see?

[128:44.65]God, a gun comes in.
[128:45.89]Fucking Jesus.
[128:46.98]Okay.
[128:48.28]Maybe I can run up.

[128:51.36]Let's see if this works.
[128:54.40]Okay.
[128:55.30]Then this guy's gonna come down with a gun and I can backstab him.
[129:00.46]Or is he not gonna come in here?
[129:06.19]Wasn't there a guy?
[129:06.89]Yeah, there he is.
[129:08.53]Just wait till he comes through, and then... One, two, three.
[129:14.77]The long fucking animation there.
[129:16.91]That's what I'm gonna do, though.
[129:21.29]I probably... I don't even need to wait, to be honest.
[129:23.07]Let's just go wherever he turns the corner.
[129:28.70]Alright, where are you at now?
[129:29.86]Come investigate.
[129:32.12]Alright, one guy over there.
[129:33.30]I'll make sure I'm not gonna see the glass.
[129:39.81]I'll take a gun.
[129:40.81]More ammo.
[129:41.45]I have the mask on, why am I not using it?
[129:43.99]Alright, nobody down, nobody over.
[129:45.17]Okay, yeah, there is a guy there, actually.
[129:46.67]There's two.
[129:53.86]Oh, what the fuck was that?
[129:55.32]What was that weird corner bullshit?
[129:57.46]What the hell was that?
[130:02.18]What the fuck was that?
[130:03.20]Aye, aye, aye.
[130:08.40]I missed him.
[130:17.21]You know, I got a better idea.
[130:19.83]And it would have worked.
[130:22.67]Damn it.
[130:25.46]That guy almost got me through the fucking wall.
[130:28.60]Well, he's coming over here, apparently.
[130:31.14]I can't go over there.
[130:35.54]Alright, done.
[130:36.66]Let's go.
[130:40.84]Oh, come on!
[130:41.74]Come on!
[130:42.78]Ay-yi-yi!
[130:55.05]Alright, fundamentals here.
[130:56.13]Don't be crazy.
[130:57.69]You have to beat it, come on.
[131:06.94]Oh my god, I missed.
[131:24.92]Not really.
[131:30.11]Is it the last guy?
[131:30.77]I think it might be.
[131:31.51]No, there's two guys down here, aren't there?
[131:33.31]Yeah.
[131:33.85]Give me a shotgun for this.
[131:34.83]Eight rounds.
[131:36.81]Okay.
[131:37.77]Uh, I'm gonna pull... Oh, man.
[131:41.99]I've got an idea.
[131:42.41]I'm gonna shoot through the glass.
[131:52.84]Okay, that takes care of those two.
[131:55.53]Don't shoot it again, you dummy.
[132:00.34]My question is... How do I take these guys out?
[132:05.10]I'm gonna have to pull them through.
[132:06.18]I'm gonna have to shoot this guy when he comes down.
[132:08.78]And then hopefully they... They didn't react at all.
[132:13.25]Fuck.
[132:14.81]Oh no.
[132:16.21]Do I have any grenades?
[132:29.82]I gotta be quick!
[132:36.23]Why are they not moving?
[132:37.79]Oh no.
[132:51.21]Again.
[132:53.00]God, I hate this mouse.
[133:12.49]One bullet hits me.
[133:16.59]Alright, slow it down.
[133:35.96]I just assumed the guy was gonna run through the room when he...
[133:41.07]When I shot his... the other guard.
[133:42.87]I just was... Why wouldn't the guy run into the room when I shot the guy on the right?
[133:48.65]I don't know.
[133:49.15]Okay.
[134:05.58]I gotta get rid of this guy.
[134:08.92]Through the glass.
[134:09.44]What am I doing through the glass?
[134:18.99]They aren't friends.
[134:20.09]Yeah, but you wouldn't, listen, you wouldn't hear this and be like, oh, maybe I should not, oh no, I forgot to shoot this guy.
[134:25.86]I'm gonna get them both in one shot.
[134:26.82]I'm running out of bullets again.
[134:33.56]Fuck.
[134:39.51]Thank God.
[134:40.25]Okay, let's move.
[134:47.16]Really?

[151:44.19]Oh, I thought that was a window!
[151:59.63]He's still alive.
[152:06.36]Oh, what did he do?
[152:07.78]He died!
[152:15.15]Okay, slow-mo rewind that right now.
[152:17.69]Do it right now.
[152:18.19]Go back and rewind the fucking game.
[152:20.95]And watch those bullets go through the guy's face.
[152:22.89]What happened there?
[152:46.84]Does this guy have a... Okay, melee weapon.
[152:50.81]Holy shit.
[152:51.89]What?
[152:52.41]Oh my god, I'm panicking.
[152:53.91]Alright, I need a... I don't know what I need.
[153:06.42]I need a huge glass.
[153:13.27]Alright, let's go.
[153:16.97]Two out of two.
[153:22.27]I'll take the big shotgun.
[153:23.17]Why not?
[153:32.10]Oh, fuck.
[153:32.66]I didn't... He turned on me quick.
[153:39.90]Really?
[153:40.24]Really?
[153:41.54]Like, fucking really?
[153:42.26]I'm just gonna shoot you then.
[153:50.69]Well, no.
[153:52.23]Okay.
[153:52.73]I don't... I want to throw.
[153:53.63]I don't want to grab anybody.
[153:55.47]I didn't want to grab that guy.
[154:09.24]Glass.
[154:09.72]I'll shoot this guy through the glass.
[154:11.54]Wait, speaking of glass.
[154:12.20]No, not that.
[154:26.61]I'm so... Okay, he can shoot me through that glass.
[154:33.63]Any more glass?
[154:34.35]Nope.
[154:34.85]I'm just gonna go through this room.
[154:36.54]Get them both in one shot.
[154:38.20]Ready?
[154:39.64]One.
[154:40.84]Two.
[154:42.90]Three.
[154:44.42]Holy fuck!
[154:48.18]No, I'm okay.
[154:51.13]Am I though?
[154:51.59]Now I have three people in this room to deal with.
[155:01.62]Okay.
[155:05.84]That, I think, thank god it's long enough.
[155:08.08]Alright, two to two.
[155:08.80]Where is he?
[155:09.20]Right here.
[155:09.60]That's the last guy in this whole place.
[155:11.68]Make it easy on yourself.
[155:12.54]Alright, thank goodness.
[155:26.27]Okay.
[155:27.87]No masks in here, right?
[155:36.29]Holy... Um... What the fuck is this?
[155:52.84]I... Oh no, I can't go anywhere.
[155:59.11]There's no bullets in this gun!
[156:00.49]Fuck!
[156:03.23]Fuck!
[156:06.11]Holy god.
[156:07.09]Oh, now I'm in trouble.
[156:13.90]Oh, now I'm in trouble.
[156:23.82]I gotta hide.
[156:29.85]Who's throwing this shit?
[156:32.11]Oh my god!
[156:39.20]I don't have any more bullets.
[156:51.14]Holy shit, man.
[156:52.54]They don't give you a second.
[157:03.25]Jesus Christ.
[157:08.13]It's pinpoint fucking accuracy!
[157:15.27]I'm so dead again.
[157:15.99]I need a different gun.
[157:25.48]Holy shit, this is INSANE.
[157:32.00]I'm trying to pick the gun up.
[157:33.42]I just didn't- I couldn't get it.
[157:45.50]Oh lord, this is the hardest thing I've done the whole game.
[158:05.34]It's not enough to kill all of them.
[158:09.44]Jesus.
[158:10.22]My lord.
[158:20.12]I give up, you win.
[158:21.50]Don't even think about it.
[158:22.64]I'm not going over there unless I have a gun.
[158:25.86]I don't have a gun.
[158:26.36]Are there any guns on the ground?
[158:28.59]He's gonna... He's gonna stand up and shoot me.
[158:33.77]Okay, you're good.
[158:37.15]Alright, get to the car.
[158:38.50]Let's go.
[158:59.58]Hey, C-!
[159:00.64]No, I'll probably get like a B. Give me a B. C+.
[159:05.38]I'm alright with that.
[159:11.06]Oh, I got a... Peter.
[159:16.36]Brick.
[159:24.35]Why is everybody just dead?
[159:28.41]Hey, you.
[159:29.29]VIPs only tonight.
[159:30.13]I think you better leave.
[159:38.04]Why is it VIPs only?
[159:40.16]I am- What the fuck are you looking at?
[159:45.70]Oh, it's that guy.
[159:46.38]Okay.
[159:47.82]Interesting.
[159:55.57]Get out of the way.
[159:56.69]Part four.
[159:59.24]Connections.
[160:11.42]That's a new mask.
[160:14.03]Hey!
[160:15.71]Oh, what the f- Why does clicking skip?
[160:22.77]I like, went to go click on her to- and it skipped it.
[160:26.65]Instantly.
[160:28.55]What did it say?
[160:37.36]I tried like didn't know that literally clicking the button one time skips the whole cutscene.
[160:48.87]I can't restart this.
[161:02.44]What the fuck is go- What did I just do?
[161:03.84]What happened?
[161:04.38]What?
[161:04.90]What's going on?
[161:20.00]Is it- I can't- Can I- How do I watch the-
[161:32.88]Play level 11 again.
[161:36.44]What?
[161:37.12]Why?
[161:37.80]You told me to go back?
[161:40.45]I have to play the last level over again.
[161:42.43]Alright, give me a TL;DR.
[161:48.79]What did the girl say and what happens when you talk to the rat?
[161:51.21]I don't want to play that last level again.
[161:58.98]Watch it on YouTube.
[162:00.02]Oh.
[162:06.19]It's a one minute cutscene.
[162:07.27]Alright, hold on.
[162:09.51]What should I search for?
[162:10.79]Like... Rat on couch, Miami?
[162:15.15]No, there's gonna be a shitload of articles about like a rat problem in Florida.
[162:21.49]Alright, uh...
[162:35.92]I'm not gonna- there's no way to- Chapter 12.
[162:39.32]Chapter 12 intro scene.
[162:41.50]Hotline Miami.
[162:50.57]Um, this is not very- I don't think I can find a decent video here.
[162:55.67]And these are all, like, let's plays.
[162:57.49]I'm- somebody's been talking.
[163:07.61]Hold on.
[163:09.51]I just saw it.
[163:11.39]Okay, you get shot.
[163:15.19]And then... Looks like it's only you and me left.
[163:20.34]I'm sure you know by now that this won't end well.
[163:24.02]Soon you'll be all alone, but that's okay.
[163:26.66]Before we say goodbye, I'll let you in on a little secret.
[163:31.11]What you do from here on won't serve any purpose.
[163:34.54]You will never see the whole picture.
[163:36.04]This is the chicken saying this.
[163:37.16]And it's all your own fault.
[163:38.88]Now it's time for you to leave.
[163:40.02]There's a warm bed across the hall from here, and you look like you could use some rest.
[163:45.60]Then he goes over, and he turns into, like, another character.
[163:48.75]He turns into... Now he's in, like, a hospital.
[163:52.25]And his head explodes, and then he lies down.
[163:58.01]Alright, I got it.
[163:59.05]I figured out... I understand.
[164:05.27]I don't know if he's been in a coma for weeks now.
[164:12.62]But he's going to wake up, right?
[164:14.60]Chat didn't see it.
[164:18.40]Why did you tell me to restart?
[164:21.00]I gotta stop listening.
[164:23.62]I gotta stop listening to chat every time.
[164:25.71]Don't show it.
[164:33.35]What?
[164:34.23]What?
[164:36.24]There was one guy?
[164:37.18]No, it was like 400 guys.
[164:40.18]It was like three to four hundred guys.
[164:45.57]He's gonna wake up.
[164:46.19]Alright, listen, I'll give you the TL;DR.
[164:49.37]You walk in, guy on the couch shoots you, you fall down, you get back up, he says, hey, this is fucking all, this is fucked up, ain't it, buddy?
[164:56.24]And you're like, yeah, and then you walk out and your head explodes.
[165:03.27]There you go.
[165:03.80]This guy is a prime suspect in a major case.
[165:09.52]Look, my guess is as good as yours.
[165:11.65]Though I can say that it might be a while.
[165:14.01]Still not even fully healed from the surgery.
[165:16.61]Is there nothing you can do?
[165:17.73]We need this guy.
[165:56.64]Here, look.
[165:58.00]See?
[165:58.28]Just pretend I'm playing this.
[166:04.86]Holiday sale.
[166:08.54]Hey, make sure you check out Fry's Electronics.
[166:14.64]Goddamn.
[166:16.15]Alright, fuck it.
[166:17.19]Who cares?
[166:22.41]Wait, wait, wait.
[166:22.95]Get... Here, watch.
[166:25.29]Ready?
[166:28.49]See?
[166:31.53]There you go.
[166:32.01]That's it.
[166:32.31]So I'm in a coma.
[166:40.47]See?
[166:40.65]There you go.
[166:44.38]But that asshole ain't saying shit.
[166:46.46]And what makes you think this guy will?
[166:49.26]July 21st.
[166:51.16]Wait, I'm in the hospital.
[166:56.33]Hey, where do you think you're going, prick?
[166:58.39]I guess we better put restraints on you.
[167:01.22]July 21st.
[167:04.86]Oh, I thought every day was counting.
[167:06.50]Alright, well, I gotta sneak out.
[167:11.03]You get a bigger house on the 21st.
[167:27.06]The world is just spinning around now.
[167:28.64]Okay.
[167:32.84]This is hard to control.
[167:35.42]I don't like this.
[167:36.14]I hate this.
[167:37.64]Oh, no.
[167:38.08]I don't want to do this now.
[167:39.54]How do I get out of here?
[167:40.32]Can I go back outside?
[167:41.34]Because I turned the... Here, hold on.
[167:49.16]There you go.
[167:52.07]Am I missing something here?
[167:54.89]The other way?
[168:00.84]I can't go back outside.
[168:01.72]I can't open this window.
[168:14.41]Oh, okay.
[168:18.97]He's distracted.
[168:22.15]Alright, so I can go up there.
[168:25.01]Is there any patrol over here?
[168:27.67]Is this guy right here?
[168:31.83]You can see through the window, right?
[168:33.67]Oh fuck, I gotta move now.
[168:35.40]Can you see me through the window?
[168:36.26]I have no idea.
[168:39.24]I gotta go that way.
[168:40.06]Okay, let's go forward now.
[168:45.92]Okay.
[168:51.88]Through that door.
[168:54.54]Watch out for that guy reading.
[168:57.42]I'm going to go in the next attempt.
[168:58.36]Wait, watch out for the doctor.
[168:59.86]Is he going to come down here now?
[169:00.82]Here we go.
[169:04.34]What?
[169:04.58]What's going on?
[169:04.94]Holy fuck.
[169:05.90]Oh, I thought that... Come on, man.
[169:20.41]Is there anything in here I need to get?
[169:21.47]I don't think so.
[169:28.76]I'm assuming I just have to go over here.
[169:38.83]Oh my god, give me a break, really?
[169:54.67]What?
[169:54.95]The fucking window!
[169:56.49]Fuck you!
[169:57.18]No!
[170:01.90]Come on.
[170:22.27]Okay.
[170:27.37]More escape mission.
[170:29.31]Is there anywhere that I have to go in particular?
[170:34.33]I'm just going to go slow, room to room.
[170:37.17]Oh, that's not going to happen.
[170:38.53]Go back in.
[170:39.03]I'm down.
[170:43.27]Hey, hold it right there.
[170:43.89]You're not allowed out of here.
[170:44.71]Get back to your room now.
[170:47.75]Oh.
[170:49.79]Fucking idiot.
[170:56.83]This is not fun on hardcore.
[171:00.09]I can't imagine most of this game would be very fun on hardcore.
[171:05.33]Jesus.
[171:06.69]I have to make it over there?
[171:08.12]What the hell?
[171:23.41]When he passes, I'm going to go into this room here.
[171:30.20]Eh, never mind, there's another guy there.
[171:31.58]I actually could probably make it there in one... In one go.
[171:50.52]Into this room here.
[172:00.75]Jump out the window, nobody can see me.
[172:02.00]Alright, from here, it looks like... Can I... I can't punch anybody, can I?
[172:10.78]I mean, there's a spot... One second here, if... Like, if I go right... Now.
[172:22.47]I might be able to make it all the way over here.
[172:25.05]Okay, next run-through.
[172:30.36]another guy coming one there comes two alright now when he's gone this guy comes around time to go one two three go what the it drunkenly walked me into the other way
[173:10.31]What's this door for here?
[173:12.31]What?
[173:12.85]Uh... What the fuck is going on?
[173:36.51]Watch out for the windows.
[173:45.37]You can just skip that whole sequence.
[173:51.74]Okay.
[173:53.58]Why put all that nonsense down there where you could just walk out and leave?
[174:03.82]I guess so.
[174:06.87]Somebody's fucking up my car.
[174:18.85]Caution tape.
[174:22.92]Dead body.
[174:24.04]Looks like this is a crime scene.
[174:26.42]What was in?
[174:31.59]Like a clothes?
[174:36.51]Oh, he's in my clothes.
[174:39.89]Okay.
[174:54.94]The car still works?
[174:57.78]Assault.
[174:58.62]The 13th chapter.
[174:59.42]Richard.
[174:59.70]Oh, let's see.
[175:00.22]How about... Rip and steal.
[175:01.28]Quiet gunshots.
[175:01.84]Ooh.
[175:16.47]Okay, this... I don't know what I'm doing here.
[175:18.72]Is this like a... Well, okay.
[175:28.18]We got one, two... I could probably go like this.
[175:30.68]I'm gonna wait for him to come around.
[175:34.34]Knock you out.
[175:35.46]Watch out.
[175:37.67]Oh, I thought I had a gun!
[175:38.57]I didn't think I had a... That looks like a gun in his hands.
[175:55.99]What?
[175:56.89]I'm so confused right now.
[175:58.01]What am I... What the fuck am I holding?
[175:59.35]Is it a baton?
[176:05.25]So these guys don't have... Who has the gun then?
[176:08.19]Okay.
[176:10.34]They don't have guns.
[176:11.16]I'm so worried about being shot.
[176:19.40]I thought... Didn't I get shot at first?
[176:27.07]Okay, well now they did.
[176:27.97]I didn't get it.
[176:35.78]Goddamn.
[176:41.94]No, I wanted to hold on to that.
[176:46.90]I- I hate- I don't like this weapon!
[176:49.00]The weapon is like, awkward for me.
[176:50.28]I don't know why.
[177:02.57]Machine gun.
[177:03.33]Alright, hold on a second here.
[177:06.83]It's the same as the other weapons?
[177:08.71]You know what it is?
[177:09.89]Is it the fact that he's switching hands?
[177:12.49]Does that happen with the other weapons too?
[177:13.68]Is that something I've never noticed?
[177:14.64]Let's try going in here.
[177:27.88]Okay.
[177:32.85]Okay, I guess I got a gun now.
[177:35.25]Watch out for the window.
[177:37.17]Okay, guy in there.
[177:43.92]What?
[177:45.06]What?
[177:46.14]What the fuck?
[177:50.30]I was across the whole game.
[178:02.68]Oh my fucking god.
[178:11.37]Oh my fucking god.
[178:13.09]Pull me back in here.
[178:37.49]Here comes the guy with the gun.
[178:39.31]Another guy with a gun.
[178:47.83]Speaking of guns, please give this one to me.
[178:55.99]Alright.
[178:57.45]I'm not going this way again.
[178:59.39]Although I might have to do this.
[179:04.03]Okay, got him.
[179:05.77]What is that?
[179:06.55]I don't know.
[179:06.93]I think there's somebody behind him.
[179:08.21]That's the guy that killed me last time, right?
[179:14.66]I gotta do this a little slower.
[179:16.34]Um...
[179:21.29]I can fucking tell there's a guy right here.
[179:23.37]Oh, fuck.
[179:24.13]They're silent.
[179:24.57]It's okay.
[179:24.99]Alright, up here.
[179:25.63]No.
[179:26.05]God.
[179:26.49]I don't know.
[179:26.85]I just don't know if there's a guy right down there.
[179:33.04]Let's take care of that.
[179:43.87]And we got the window here.
[179:55.41]guy there that guy would have killed me thank goodness okay be careful is there another guy down here oh there's another window oh yeah what about down here no I think that's the only guy okay only guy watch it he's gonna be at the window in a second watch it what what that's not a window that's is that how did he shoot through that that's not a wall
[180:25.22]How did he shoot through the fucking black thing?
[180:29.18]Wait, is that not a wall?
[180:36.83]That's a metal detector.
[180:38.33]Oh, come on.
[180:41.57]Oh my lord, what the hell?
[180:44.05]I was so caw.
[180:45.21]That's the first time ever that you see it.
[180:48.75]That's just a doorway.
[180:49.89]It's the only doorway that's not brown.
[180:59.70]I'm so, so unhappy.
[181:03.46]I gotta get in here.
[181:15.69]He's gonna get up.
[181:43.92]Stupid metal detector.
[181:50.30]I'm actually more comfortable just running in there and fucking hitting it with a baton, I think.
[182:03.99]Where's the other guy?
[182:06.85]He's right down here.
[182:11.69]I think I want to get the giraffe for this.
[182:16.68]Not being able to see down here really sucks.
[182:18.36]I got him.
[182:18.76]Okay.
[182:19.76]But wait, wait, wait, wait.
[182:20.52]Watch out for the fucking windows over here.
[182:22.04]Shit.
[182:32.49]How did you... What the fuck?
[182:41.05]Holy shit!
[182:44.81]Oh my, I did it!
[182:49.06]Oh my goodness.
[182:51.04]Okay.
[182:51.86]How the hell do I get over here?
[182:59.64]Oh, right, the metal detector.
[183:04.04]Jerma sounds so scared of this stream.
[183:06.12]I am, this is hard, man.
[183:08.95]This is, this is like 1000% focus.
[183:35.42]Window guy.
[183:36.44]Can that guy shoot?
[183:37.15]I don't think he can.
[183:43.17]Alright, I'm going back down this way.
[183:50.13]No, I don't want that.
[183:50.65]Give me this back.
[183:52.31]Okay, take it easy.
[183:55.07]That's it for that.
[183:59.05]That guy.
[184:03.70]No windows, right?
[184:05.92]He can't shoot me through here.
[184:06.96]I'm safe.
[184:14.55]I almost died right there.
[184:15.37]That was a 100% almost died.
[184:18.97]Okay.
[184:20.39]One guy left right here.
[184:23.41]Holy fuck.
[184:24.49]He turned on me so hard.
[184:29.53]Got it.
[184:30.85]Keep going.
[184:45.17]Okay, boys, the bastard will be here any second now.
[184:47.79]It's time for us to show him what we're made of.
[184:50.37]Remember your training and play it safe.
[184:52.11]Follow protocol and we'll all make it out alive.
[184:54.21]Okay, whatever you say.
[185:01.14]Well, you did it.
[185:02.06]You won.
[185:02.54]You got the bad guy.
[185:11.10]And what did I die by again?
[185:12.50]I'm not entirely sure.
[185:17.37]He's alive.
[185:22.95]Window.
[185:23.23]Out of bullets, though.
[185:35.22]No, I'm not.
[185:35.78]There's another guy in there.
[185:41.28]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[185:48.88]I missed.
[185:54.72]Did I death add myself?
[185:55.71]Yeah, I did.
[185:59.67]I can't even tell anymore.
[186:01.07]I'm gonna rip these fucking buttons off with pliers.
[186:20.63]Something about this doesn't feel right.
[186:21.91]Okay, watch the fucking idiot that comes through here.
[186:48.59]Why is he using the motion controls?
[186:52.85]Alright, all of them are dead up there.
[186:53.91]I just have to worry about the guys in this room.
[186:56.53]That's correct.
[187:02.90]Who's left?
[187:03.56]Guy up there.
[187:04.84]Easy.
[187:05.82]No walls, no windows to deal with.
[187:09.48]And then here comes his buddy.
[187:10.80]And then here comes his other buddy.
[187:12.62]Oh no, don't go out there.
[187:13.44]No, go out there.
[187:19.74]That leaves us with the guy in the top room and the right side.
[187:22.39]Right side.
[187:23.01]I can't... I think I wanna... I don't know what I wanna do.
[187:26.53]I think I wanna be careful.
[187:29.67]How do I get in here?
[187:53.26]Like, open the cell or something?
[187:54.64]Oh, shit!
[187:55.18]I got Richter!
[187:57.66]Is there a way to, like... Do I need to do anything else?
[188:22.82]Oh, okay.
[188:23.48]That was kind of blending in with the blood.
[188:25.58]I thought it was blood on my prep roll.
[188:32.27]Alright, open.
[188:40.86]Do I have to shoot this guy?
[188:42.62]No.
[188:43.33]You gotta be shitting me.
[188:44.17]Why are you... Look, man.
[188:46.03]I'm sorry about your girl.
[188:47.39]It wasn't anything personal.
[188:49.67]I know you made it all the way here, but I think you're in for a disappointment.
[188:53.14]I don't really have any answers for you.
[189:05.97]Damn, that hurt.
[189:07.61]You know, I think we might not be that different, you and I. Have you also been getting those weird phone calls?
[189:16.60]Kogha.
[189:18.84]I wish I had something to tell you, but I don't.
[189:20.96]The police seem to know more about this mess than I do.
[189:23.26]They probably have a fire on the case.
[189:25.40]A file on the case around here somewhere.
[189:27.78]I'd ask you to spare my life, but... Kogha, you look like you've made up your mind.
[189:36.33]Spare or kill.
[189:41.16]What did I do?
[189:42.98]Oh, I'm already killing him.
[189:47.20]I killed him.
[189:47.68]He's dead.
[189:49.00]Well, see you later.
[189:56.87]Alright, we're looking for that.
[189:59.61]The filing cabinet with the file.
[190:03.07]Chapter done.
[190:03.66]Go to the car.
[190:07.10]Am I gonna get run over by another one?
[190:10.36]I got the mask.
[190:11.10]Alright, wait for the car to explode through here.
[190:27.79]No worries, boys.
[190:28.73]It's not canon.
[190:31.03]Did you just spoil me on the whole game?
[190:33.53]Did you just spoil everything for me?
[190:35.57]What?
[190:55.47]Zack the Frog, I don't care what this does.
[190:57.37]I will never take this off.
[191:05.49]Uzi machine gun.
[191:10.24]July 23rd.
[191:12.10]More weird shit in my house.
[191:17.34]Spreading out all the files.
[191:20.82]Suspects claim to have been threatened into- instructed to kill by messages on their phone calls traced to a club on South 86th Street with ties to an underground Russian mafia network.
[191:33.21]Multiple accounts of illegal activity reported.
[191:35.99]Insufficient evidence for a warrant.
[191:37.67]Okie dokie.
[191:46.32]Looks like that's where we're going.
[191:55.88]This one's called Vengeance.
[191:59.44]We're not gonna do Peter.
[192:02.99]Longer combo window.
[192:04.31]Just wanna see what the other one does.
[192:08.21]Killing throws.
[192:08.99]Start with a Silenced Uzi.
[192:10.57]That's pretty great.
[192:13.72]But I need to put the Frog Mask on.
[192:15.52]Longer combo window.
[192:24.96]That's it.
[192:25.32]I did it.
[192:25.62]I beat the level.
[192:26.14]Whoa.
[192:26.46]Damn it.
[192:26.98]Damn it.
[192:27.64]I want the gun!
[192:29.76]I want the gun!
[192:31.08]I want the gun!
[192:59.20]Actually a good thing.
[193:08.65]Turned out to be a good thing.
[193:11.41]Alright, what we got?
[193:14.99]Hey, hey, easy.
[193:21.48]Oh fuck.
[193:23.12]Come on, man.
[193:35.22]How does one attempt to reliably do something like this over and over again?
[193:38.62]That didn't connect.
[193:47.25]This might be a bad mask for this.
[193:50.40]I'm starting to realize this right now.
[194:03.90]Start with a silenced Uzi.
[194:05.06]That makes this room a thousand times easier.
[194:14.58]Only one shot left, and it's for the dog.
[194:16.52]And I didn't even get the dog because I missed.
[194:17.97]I need this now.
[194:20.33]I'm dead.
[194:21.83]I can't kill this guy.
[194:34.22]Yeah, I have to put another mask on.
[194:36.78]I feel like I'm not going to complete this without a different mask.
[194:50.43]Through the window, through there.
[194:51.89]I got to kill this guy right now.
[194:54.45]Watch out for the dog.
[194:55.69]How did you... He saw me through the window.
[194:59.85]Son of a...
[195:03.84]Okay, that's not fair.
[195:06.12]Not fair.
[195:06.64]That's gonna make me escape the game and go put a new mask on because that was fucking dumb.
[195:11.05]That was dumb.
[195:12.39]Everything about that was stupid.
[195:13.41]He spun around like three times and then landed on me.
[195:24.53]Alright, let's do the rat.
[195:32.70]Silenced Uzi.
[195:34.80]Easy enough, I'm not going to use it yet.
[195:42.83]Why would you... Get on him!
[195:45.37]What is... Get on top of his head!
[195:46.97]Give me the... Give me the Uzi.
[195:48.99]Silenced... That's not an Uzi.
[195:50.93]Where's my Uzi?
[195:54.23]That's not an Uzi.
[195:59.25]There it is.
[196:01.72]Alright.
[196:05.92]Beautiful.
[196:06.38]This is gonna be so much easier.
[196:13.01]Through the wall here, gonna get through the window.
[196:15.97]No, actually I'm gonna get you.
[196:24.04]Holy fuck.
[196:25.48]He tripped and died, I think.
[196:26.44]Alright, we're good?
[196:29.26]Much better start than anything I've done before.
[196:30.73]So here comes the dog.
[196:38.72]Oh my fucking lord!
[196:47.94]Of course the monster truck's in the way.
[196:50.52]Which way though?
[196:51.76]Which way is the way where I'm not gonna get sniped by some random person?
[196:59.38]That is the right way.
[197:00.38]See, first time I put the Uzi on and it's over.
[197:14.74]I just feel like this is wrong again.
[197:23.47]I feel slower again.
[197:25.37]Why?
[197:46.18]Blaming mouse?
[197:47.68]Yeah, I am gonna blame the mouse with the two buttons right sitting on your index finger and middle finger where if you press them it changes the DPI of your mouse.
[197:56.62]And the only way to change it is if you download... Razer's program that boots up every time Windows starts.
[198:03.78]You have to go in and force it to not turn on to change one combination.
[198:07.30]I can't believe I'm gonna do that.
[198:08.16]I'm about to give in.
[198:11.52]I'm about to give in and download the worst piece of fucking software that currently exists.
[198:16.94]It's Razer Synapse.
[198:34.05]Razer Synapse is if Skype and Uplay had a baby.
[198:39.51]And forced your peripherals to use it.
[198:53.04]What killed me?
[198:58.02]Alright, somebody wait first of all, somebody correct me if I'm wrong here, okay?
[199:11.52]Is that the only possible way that I can change what that does?
[199:15.88]Or can I go into my actual Windows mouse settings?
[199:18.60]Is it correct?
[199:19.54]Or do I have to go get Razer Synapse?
[199:30.71]Change the settings and uninstall it, but won't uninstalling it remove the settings?
[199:40.87]There are some softwares to disable them.
[199:51.45]Super glue.
[200:02.90]I can't go... Hold on.
[200:04.12]I can't go this way.
[200:06.15]Why would... Come on.
[200:07.27]Your invisible wall...
[200:12.23]Yeah, because this is wrong again.
[200:14.67]I just clicked the button up for higher DPI.
[200:16.45]I put that button on the bottom of the mouse.
[200:38.48]Anybody following me?
[200:42.62]Oh, shit!
[200:47.14]No!
[200:47.72]That was so cool too when I flew it!
[200:53.20]I swear to God, guys.
[200:56.45]It's changing it even when I don't press it.
[201:02.49]I just impressed all my friends and it didn't even matter.
[201:14.17]Dead.
[201:14.41]Dead.
[201:14.71]Alright.
[201:17.65]He's up there.
[201:18.17]Nobody.
[201:18.55]Nobody down following me.
[201:19.61]Just... Alright.
[201:21.81]Door's going to knock this guy out, right?
[201:23.47]No, it's not.
[201:24.21]It's not going to do that, actually.
[201:34.36]Window.
[201:34.72]I would have just ran... What the hell happened?
[201:42.12]What?
[201:42.32]What?
[202:06.26]That guy came all the way down from over here.
[202:08.88]Get rid of the guys in the toilet.
[202:17.67]Oh no.
[202:21.31]Oh no!
[202:21.93]There's no guns.
[202:25.21]There's no bullets.
[202:25.81]Okay.
[202:28.07]Now I don't have to worry about that anymore.
[202:34.61]I have one shot.
[202:39.23]Thank God there's a gun right here.
[202:42.39]No.
[202:43.21]No.
[202:44.03]I have to kill this guy.
[202:45.83]I have to shoot this guy with one bullet.
[202:47.61]I have to.
[202:48.01]Trying a different technique there.
[203:15.14]I can't.
[203:16.32]I can't.
[203:16.58]I'm trying to pick the fucking knife up.
[203:20.51]I'm just tilting.
[203:22.05]I'm just on full tilt right now.
[203:29.23]That guy was just lying on the goddamn ground.
[203:35.92]Oh, fucking god.
[203:42.62]I'm going to scream.
[203:49.06]No, don't... What the fuck am I gonna do about this?
[204:06.54]My fucking god, this is unbearable!
[204:23.40]Why didn't these guys get attracted this time?
[204:25.22]Why didn't the whole fucking left side of the entire game come down this time?
[204:28.98]Why?
[204:30.56]Why does it only happen like 40% of the time?
[204:56.89]What are you doing here?
[205:03.53]I'll be right back.
[205:04.27]I'm gonna go pee.
[206:09.77]Thank you.
[208:00.12]Oh, what am I doing?
[208:07.32]I didn't even say hi, but I'm back.
[208:18.44]Why does it not connect?
[208:20.44]I'm almost at that point where nothing I do works, because I've lost it.
[208:24.06]I've lost it all.
[208:30.60]You know what I mean?
[208:31.12]Like, I'm almost at the... And here he comes!
[208:32.92]And I need a gun!
[208:33.84]How do I do this to him?
[208:44.76]Ugh.
[208:47.84]Didn't... Not even one pellet decided to go around the fucking wall.
[208:52.03]Jesus, fuck me.
[208:56.83]Here he comes.
[209:01.18]Okay, this fucking guy's dead.
[209:03.18]It's over.
[209:03.56]I don't have to worry about that anymore.
[209:05.04]It's done.
[209:05.68]Just don't lose the toilet guy.
[209:23.37]I'm fucking panicking right now.
[209:25.47]Why are you guys over here?
[209:26.69]Why?
[209:27.27]What the hell?
[209:30.74]Why?
[209:30.98]What the fuck?
[209:31.86]It threw me off so bad.
[209:33.22]It threw me off so badly.
[209:35.32]It just threw me off so badly.
[209:38.32]Okay, don't even shoot these guys.
[209:46.03]Shoot them.
[209:52.29]Now be done with it.
[209:57.31]Is he chasing?
[209:57.93]Is the butcher coming over here?
[210:01.03]No, deal with the butcher first.
[210:06.99]Here comes the butcher, right?
[210:12.37]I didn't!
[210:16.62]Okay.
[210:18.06]Now I don't have a gun.
[210:19.30]I don't have a gun.
[210:23.70]I don't have any bullets.
[210:26.02]Same exact problem last time.
[210:27.26]No, we're good.
[210:27.92]Here's one.
[210:38.52]Just a melee.
[210:42.16]Oh, fuck.
[210:46.02]Who's next?
[210:46.80]Who's left?
[210:47.26]Anybody else up there?
[210:48.12]I have ten rounds.
[210:49.70]No windows.
[210:50.34]Good.
[210:50.68]Just get in here.
[210:51.24]No windows.
[210:52.03]One guy with a shotgun.
[210:54.43]Nobody else in the room?
[210:55.47]Just this one guy with a shotgun.
[210:56.75]That's it, right?
[210:59.17]Watch out for the window.
[211:00.35]Just go like this.
[211:01.01]Beep.
[211:01.43]Okay, I beeped him.
[211:03.05]And now beep this guy.
[211:06.38]And there's one more guy to beep over here.
[211:07.62]This last guy right there.
[211:09.94]Beeped him.
[211:10.38]Okay.
[211:10.78]Let's go back the other way.
[211:25.81]That's it.
[211:26.69]It's just this guy right here.
[211:29.63]Is this a bad guy or is this... I'm just gonna unload him when I open the room.
[211:45.76]Okay, look, I don't want no trouble.
[211:47.88]The safe is open, just take what you want and go.
[211:51.47]Look, I'm not the owner and he's not here.
[211:53.11]I just run the club, let's be civil about this.
[211:58.03]Alright, alright, I'll give you his address.
[212:00.71]Just please don't hurt me.
[212:01.85]Can you get shot from the residual bullet or something?
[212:08.06]Please just go now, he's on 114th place.
[212:20.79]Oh my goodness.
[212:28.87]Anything else?
[212:29.35]Any money or something I can grab?
[212:33.00]That's it, right?
[212:43.62]God.
[212:44.02]Hey, look.
[212:46.93]It's the car.
[212:47.65]Remember this?
[212:58.69]I could feel my sanity slowly slipping away during that level.
[213:11.42]New weapon unlocked.
[213:15.42]Combo combo combo combo combo combo... C+.
[213:19.18]I'm alright.
[213:23.52]New mask, we got Oscar.
[213:30.48]And the weapon is a sledgehammer.
[213:38.63]Showdown.
[213:39.37]This is the last level.
[213:41.01]Final chapter.
[213:43.91]Alright, let's take a look.
[213:47.51]This is called darkness.
[213:49.47]I don't even know if I want to do that.
[213:52.53]I didn't get the secret masks.
[213:53.79]Survive two bullets.
[213:56.70]Hmm.
[214:00.80]I want to start with the gun.
[214:03.72]Okay, here it is.
[214:05.92]Alright, two...
[214:10.82]Okay, just making sure there's nothing in here.
[214:15.96]Holy fuck.
[214:17.14]That was right when I opened the door.
[214:18.96]Alright, I got into the gun.
[214:19.82]Into the gun.
[214:27.26]Oh, no.
[214:27.80]I want to get that.
[214:28.40]Why did I do that?
[214:31.76]I got it, thank god.
[214:37.18]Oh.
[214:38.88]And who do we have here?
[214:40.40]You must be one of the assholes killing off my men.
[214:43.54]Doesn't look like you are here to chat, so why don't we get this over with?
[214:51.33]Uh... Pick it up!
[214:59.09]Pick...
[215:12.96]Okay.
[215:13.70]Leave him to me.
[215:15.68]What the fuck?!
[215:18.70]Oh... Leave him to me.
[215:30.32]What in the name of God do... You don't even give me a quarter of a second to react.
[215:38.26]Where am I supposed to go?
[215:39.27]Behind a wall?
[215:48.27]Leave him to me.
[216:00.15]They swing twice, the dash twice.
[216:02.35]Ah, fuck.
[216:03.43]One, two, shit.
[216:26.34]Damn it!
[216:39.13]Leave him to me!
[216:43.09]Crush her head!
[216:43.53]Crush it!
[216:47.15]What do I do?
[216:48.97]I'm not bad.
[216:49.61]I'm impressed.
[216:50.57]I wonder what gave you this thirst for blood.
[216:53.27]I've never seen anything quite like it.
[216:55.30]Now I want to see who's hiding behind the mask.
[217:08.30]I...
[217:29.85]Not bad.
[217:30.29]I'm impressed.
[217:31.15]I wonder what gave you this thirst for blood.
[217:32.75]I've never seen anything quite like it.
[217:34.65]Now I want to see who's hiding behind the mask.
[217:50.44]I'm gonna... I'm gonna stand back here.
[217:54.10]Come down here.
[217:54.66]You come fucking get me over here.
[217:56.44]What the fuck?
[217:57.24]Really?
[218:12.49]Why?
[218:13.59]So I can't do that.
[218:14.47]She instantly will kill me.
[218:15.60]She instantly throws a knife another way.
[218:17.40]If you try to hide behind the fountain.
[218:30.89]She just throws a knife behind cover.
[218:33.87]Yeah, she does.
[218:48.76]Alright, I'm just gonna fucking sprint.
[218:50.51]Not bad.
[218:50.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[218:53.45]Oh my god.
[219:24.49]Well, I fucked it up.
[219:41.52]I'm just gonna run to the fountain right to the right.
[219:43.86]And see what happens.
[219:44.52]I need like a knife.
[219:48.30]Jesus Christ, this is ridiculous.
[220:07.25]Why did it drop?
[220:18.22]I'm fucked here.
[220:26.18]Okay, so does he reload?
[220:27.18]Okay, so he goes reload.
[220:30.50]Oh fuck.
[220:40.75]Did I get him?
[220:41.69]What do I do now?
[220:42.27]I don't know.
[220:42.59]I don't understand.
[220:43.21]Do I have to go and attack him or something?
[220:45.94]He only has one hand.
[220:48.96]One... One.
[220:51.12]Two.
[220:51.34]I did it.
[221:02.33]I can see where this is going.
[221:04.31]I'll spare you the pleasure.
[221:07.92]What the fuck was that?
[221:08.82]I don't understand.
[221:09.64]My body can't handle what just happened.
[221:10.94]What happened?
[221:15.86]That's it.
[221:16.20]Okay.
[221:17.58]Give me this.
[221:22.29]Hello?
[221:23.15]Hello?
[221:23.89]Hello?
[221:24.11]Hello?
[221:25.07]It's your first day.
[221:26.17]What's going on down there?
[221:27.59]I'm trying to sleep.
[221:30.34]Is there anyone there?
[221:31.00]Can you hear me?
[221:31.50]Hello?
[221:31.68]Hello?
[221:38.91]Goddamn phones, I fucking hate these things.
[221:47.45]Okay.
[221:57.98]There's more?
[221:59.86]Oh shit, it's the Architect.
[222:06.27]Oh, so you're the one causing the ruckus.
[222:10.54]What's your business here?
[222:13.38]Actually, why don't we skip the details?
[222:16.78]I've done so many horrible things.
[222:18.90]Garfield?
[222:19.88]No.
[222:22.06]Nothing seems to really matter anymore, does it?
[222:24.75]I'm not going anywhere, as you can see.
[222:26.51]Just go ahead and do whatever you came here to do.
[222:35.05]Alright!
[222:38.77]Take the mask off, smoke a cigarette.
[222:47.32]Checking... What am I, looking for a Pokémon?
[222:49.24]Did I just take a selfie?
[222:53.12]Oh, I threw the phone, okay.
[223:13.76]Yes, the iPhone from the 80s.
[223:24.13]The end.
[223:25.93]Well, that was fun.
[223:28.97]That was... At some point, it was kind of like chewing on nails.
[223:42.68]But that was fun.
[223:47.44]Music by Moon.
[223:49.36]Very good.
[223:49.90]Very good song.
[223:53.24]Very good at composing.
[224:01.53]Wait, what's everybody doing?
[224:04.29]Haha, it's not over.
[224:05.51]Well, we're getting the credits.
[224:15.31]Is there an after-credits Infinity War scene?
[224:27.28]So, should I press space or something?
[224:29.86]Or do we just have to watch all the credits?
[224:45.20]Watch the credits, you boomer.
[224:50.64]How is not watching the credits a not-boomer thing?
[224:58.90]You usually get up from the movie.
[225:00.64]Yes, after-credits scenes have been a fairly new phenomenon over the last 15 years, 10 years or so.
[225:10.07]It really was only in a handful of movies, and almost every movie has an after-credits scene.
[225:30.63]That 33-year-old boomer that doesn't watch the credits.
[225:38.47]But there was no reason to 20 years ago.
[225:41.83]When the movie was over, you were like, oh, okay, that was a good movie.
[225:45.56]And then you would... This was the time when you'd hear like... Okay.
[225:47.74]Do you got your phone?
[225:51.00]Yeah, yeah.
[225:51.84]Don't leave any trash there.
[225:52.68]Pick that up.
[225:53.64]Okay.
[225:55.40]Do you have anything left in your drink?
[225:56.62]Can I have a sip of your drink?
[225:58.43]Let me check my phone.
[226:00.13]Okay, you got the keys?
[226:01.87]That's what happened here.
[226:04.01]During the credits.
[226:17.69]How can you be 33 and bald?
[226:18.79]I'm not!
[226:23.49]Dude, you understand that.
[226:25.79]Hold on, listen to me guys.
[226:28.94]Some of you guys might be young and so full of energy, but let me tell you, everybody starts to kind of thin a little bit when they get to be 30 years old, alright?
[226:38.58]It happens.
[226:39.88]Some people, they get the real good dice roll there and they don't lose any hair, but for the most part, most of us lose our damn hair after like 28.
[226:50.56]30 28 to like 35 is when you start to really thin out a little So it's gonna happen to all of us and it are and some of you guys here It's probably already happened to it's fine.
[227:06.50]There's nothing wrong with that.
[227:08.13]There's nothing wrong with it at all Maybe for you boomer, but I'll have future hair.
[227:16.75]Oh
[227:20.40]No, no, your Fortnite skin doesn't count, okay?
[227:32.41]Part five!
[227:34.93]Answers.
[227:40.35]That's the exact same sound effect.
[227:44.67]That's the same sound effect.
[227:46.25]You think I'm stupid?
[227:47.03]I look stupid to you.
[227:49.32]I know you aren't telling me everything.
[227:53.33]You helped me get into this mess.
[227:55.39]You told me it would be exciting, didn't you?
[227:57.15]Well, I'm fucking bored.
[227:58.29]I'm done, man.
[227:58.89]I've had it.
[227:59.71]I want out and you're gonna tell me how.
[228:01.07]This stupid game is gonna end now, you hear me?
[228:06.04]Alright, alright, calm down, man.
[228:08.01]You don't realize how much trouble I'll be in.
[228:09.57]There's a guy hiding out at the Blue Dragon, a tiny Chinese restaurant downtown.
[228:16.11]He knows more.
[228:17.11]Just don't mention my name to anyone, okay?
[228:19.82]I'm as good as dead anyways.
[228:22.36]New character.
[228:25.30]And is that... I don't know what that is.
[228:33.05]Motorcycle?
[228:35.13]Now I get to play as the cool character.
[228:37.59]Safe house.
[228:39.31]This is 16th chapter.
[228:42.94]Three knives?
[228:44.68]Like, I have a butcher knife.
[228:47.36]What the hell?
[228:48.82]Oh, there's a- I didn't even- I didn't even see.
[228:52.13]Okay, I gotta get back into this.
[228:53.45]I spent a whole, like, 30 minutes watching the credits.
[229:19.89]Any windows?
[229:22.97]Wait, I can't... Can I not pick up guns?
[229:25.90]Is this this character's thing?
[229:26.90]He can't pick up any... I can't pick up weapons.
[229:33.52]Can I pick up anything?
[229:34.64]I have... It's only melee.
[229:35.78]Alright, let's go.
[229:36.78]Let's go.
[229:37.24]Fucking let's go.
[229:38.34]Alright.
[229:49.83]Can I pick up the knives that I drop?
[229:55.55]Can I pick these up?
[230:02.86]I'm so confused right now.
[230:04.04]What the fuck?
[230:05.68]You can't pick up the knives.
[230:09.80]You can only pick up missed knives.
[230:11.76]Okay, well, now I'm screwed again.
[230:17.31]I'm dead.
[230:17.65]It was impossible.
[230:31.47]Okay, so I cannot pick up knives unless I miss.
[230:36.80]So just don't throw them.
[230:40.18]Except throw it at this guy, because I have to.
[230:42.04]Alright.
[230:43.58]I need to get this one more knife.
[230:45.70]I can use it on this guy, because these three guys I can take out with the knife.
[230:49.23]The question is, what's the angle here?
[230:55.07]Got it.
[230:55.31]Okay.
[230:55.47]Alright.
[230:57.59]There's no door.
[230:58.89]Be aware of that.
[230:59.69]No door.
[231:23.13]Got it.
[231:24.25]Okay.
[231:24.89]Here's the plan.
[231:25.91]I have to run through.
[231:26.78]Fuck.
[231:30.74]Why are you not noticing me?
[231:32.96]Why did you not notice me?
[231:34.73]Why did you?
[231:35.19]I'm so bad.
[231:36.13]I'm so mad that they didn't notice me.
[231:46.47]Look here, punk.
[231:47.47]I've got some things I need to know, so you better answer my questions, okay?
[231:51.09]Who are the people who keep leaving me messages?
[231:54.01]And don't even think about bullshitting me now, okay?
[231:56.19]I won't hesitate to pull you apart if I have to.
[232:01.27]I'll just tell you what I know, just don't hurt me.
[232:04.09]I can't tell you who's calling the shots, but they're using fun-nomenon to sweep up their trails.
[232:13.76]I only help them set it up at the station.
[232:16.66]You'll have to hack into their system to trace them.
[232:19.88]I went into hiding as soon as the job was finished.
[232:22.02]They seem to have some form of political agenda.
[232:25.25]Scared the shit out of me.
[232:27.05]Spent all my savings on getting this rat hole.
[232:29.63]That's all I have!
[232:30.43]Okay.
[232:53.70]Charlie!
[233:02.24]I now roll the credits.
[233:12.89]That's the first A of the evening.
[233:16.17]We unlocked Rick and Charlie.
[233:30.05]You have one message.
[233:30.77]Hello, it's Mark from Miami Drop-Off.
[233:32.81]It looks like you missed your delivery last night.
[233:34.65]We've got another parcel for you today.
[233:37.61]Please drop it off at... Our clients will not tolerate further delays.
[233:43.91]Click.
[233:56.26]Fun Games. 17.
[234:00.44]How come I don't get to pick a mask?
[234:06.41]What's going on with him?
[234:08.63]That's... Alright, that just freaked me out.
[234:10.23]Alright, anybody we need to throw a knife at?
[234:19.38]Maybe.
[234:20.20]I think I can get this guy without anyone knowing.
[234:24.58]And his buddy.
[234:27.81]I think I can do it all without throwing a single knife.
[234:31.87]No, maybe not this guy right here.
[234:33.05]I can definitely bait this guy in the room.
[234:37.25]Now, the question is, can I kill this guy without throwing a knife?
[234:44.92]That's going to be very... I don't think so.
[234:49.18]Maybe if he goes in the bathroom?
[235:04.45]Got it.
[235:04.67]Okay.
[235:05.97]Clean.
[235:07.19]Very clean.
[235:11.57]Oh, fuck.
[235:11.93]I thought that was a statue.
[235:27.64]Whoa!
[235:27.78]You saw me.
[235:39.48]Oh come on, you butthead!
[235:58.51]Oh my god, I can run into that.
[236:01.73]Wait for him to come around again.
[236:02.49]Another dog.
[236:03.21]Good thing I waited.
[236:11.91]Alright.
[236:12.83]Anybody left?
[236:13.43]We got two down there, both melee.
[236:17.44]Two guys with guns.
[236:18.22]I should be able to get one too.
[236:19.52]Is there anybody else in there that can shoot me through the fucking window?
[236:25.84]No.
[236:26.28]Okay.
[236:26.80]That guy can, but deal with these guys first.
[236:31.20]So, I'm talking about a go through, kill the... I'm talking about wait till he goes up, and then we'll talk.
[236:46.63]Alright.
[236:47.51]Now we can talk.
[236:54.48]Oh, fuck!
[236:57.60]Okay, we're good.
[236:59.22]Only these two guys left.
[237:01.32]Don't get shot through the door if this guy's gonna come at you.
[237:05.64]I seriously just panicked so hard for no reason, and this is the last guy.
[237:10.25]One, two, three... There's another guy!
[237:12.37]There's another guy!
[237:16.10]Okay, we're fine.
[237:21.86]My heart is killing me.
[237:22.80]I'm gonna have a heart attack on camera.
[237:24.86]I'm just gonna start going like... Boomer gets heart attack.
[237:43.05]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[237:43.99]Go ahead, say it.
[237:44.97]Go ahead.
[237:53.82]Chat wants facecam.
[237:54.72]I don't have any clothes on.
[237:56.89]I'm not doing it.
[237:58.93]Got Brandon.
[238:01.51]And there's another weapon that's been unlocked.
[238:04.58]I'm not seeing these anywhere, though.
[238:06.04]A sledgehammer?
[238:07.26]I haven't seen a sledgehammer at all.
[238:22.21]You have one new message.
[238:23.03]Hi, it's Jane.
[238:24.37]It was nice to see you again.
[238:25.61]How about another date tonight?
[238:26.95]Pick me up at Northeast 158th Street around 9, okay?
[238:31.20]And put on one of those nice suits you got.
[238:33.42]You're taking me somewhere fancy this evening.
[238:41.53]Show us your sweaty chest.
[238:46.27]Sweaty chest.
[238:55.21]18th chapter.
[238:55.89]Prank call.
[238:57.59]So, we got... Uh, they have guns?
[238:58.85]Um... Okay.
[238:59.21]Do it.
[238:59.53]I didn't get points for that.
[239:00.75]Uh, sorry.
[239:01.87]It was just a prank call.
[239:04.98]I don't understand.
[239:28.08]Wait, uh, am I the guy at the computer?
[239:35.69]I'm the guy at the computer.
[239:37.65]Stay away from me.
[239:39.89]Security, security, look, sir, please don't kill me.
[239:42.35]Please, I'll do anything.
[239:50.79]Interesting.
[239:51.77]North, 87th place, huh?
[239:53.43]So that's where you've been hiding.
[239:55.99]That's me.
[240:00.19]Get out of here if you don't want to die.
[240:01.79]Okay, have it your way.
[240:07.91]Wait, do I have to fight myself?
[240:14.46]What the hell is going on?
[240:16.32]You had your chance.
[240:19.34]What?
[240:24.16]I'm so confused.
[240:25.91]That's not... That's not canon.
[240:29.73]You guys, that's not canon.
[240:32.51]That's what that comes from.
[240:40.98]They were just in the way.
[240:44.36]That's why everyone said that, and that's why I got spoiled.
[240:56.84]So what happens, what really happens?
[240:58.76]You have one new message.
[240:59.68]Hi, it's Ben from Miami Funeral Home.
[241:03.45]I'm just calling to tell you we have the tombstone you ordered done and ready to be delivered.
[241:06.99]With a little luck, you should be getting it before the weekend.
[241:11.75]Click.
[241:14.35]Okay.
[241:17.67]Alright.
[241:27.96]19th chapter, Resolution.
[241:31.80]Resolution.
[241:34.00]Here we go.
[241:37.18]It was the janitor the whole time.
[241:38.64]What's this?
[241:39.36]Looks like I need a password to access this computer.
[241:59.00]It was the janitor.
[241:59.70]I could have killed the janitor too when I had a chance.
[242:05.00]What?
[242:08.14]Okay, this is just the Riddler from Batman.
[242:10.91]Didn't this happen in Arkham City?
[242:14.95]What's going on down here?
[242:15.89]Who are you people?
[242:20.67]We're playing a game, aren't we?
[242:23.35]And you're one of our pawns, aren't you?
[242:25.03]I guess this means game over.
[242:29.09]Who are you working for?
[242:30.23]You're the phone guys.
[242:31.69]What a stupid question you really need to ask.
[242:34.17]What does it look like to you, asshole?
[242:36.64]You don't know anything, do you?
[242:38.78]You think this is a game?
[242:39.62]Why are you doing this?
[242:41.16]We were bored, that's why.
[242:44.88]Why would we need to justify our actions?
[242:48.15]You've done far worse things than we have, haven't you?
[242:50.91]Besides, do you even know how much money we're making?
[242:57.62]killed anyone.
[242:58.16]You have.
[242:59.25]They were all scum anyway, weren't they?
[243:01.95]You think they deserve to live, do you?
[243:05.69]That's it.
[243:07.12]You seem disappointed.
[243:08.80]What were you expecting?
[243:10.66]I think we're through with your questions.
[243:13.78]Yeah, your move, creep.
[243:30.93]Okay.
[243:32.33]Where's the password?
[243:38.47]Phil?
[243:38.87]Okay, I just got Phil.
[243:47.19]So I don't have a password.
[243:53.75]Huh.
[244:03.56]The password is the secret from each level.
[244:06.36]Oh, okay.
[244:07.66]You have to find letters throughout every level and put them in order in the computer, meaning you have to play through again if you want the true ending.
[244:12.39]Oh, okay.
[244:14.71]That's pretty cool, though.
[244:20.17]You gotta collect the pixels.
[244:28.90]So I can't even access it.
[244:29.96]Alright.
[244:32.48]Gotta catch them all.
[244:36.66]Each letter for the password is a tiny dot, so they're hard to find.
[244:39.26]That's cool.
[244:43.29]Watch the credits, Boomer.
[244:44.45]We gotta watch the cred- That was an entire after-credits sequence, but we're running another credits f- after the after-credits sequence.
[244:52.78]Imagine if that happened.
[244:56.11]Oh my god, the after credits of Deadpool!
[244:58.87]I can't believe it!
[244:59.95]Cable's gonna be in the next movie?!
[245:01.67]Alright, I'll roll all the credits again.
[245:04.99]Wait, did they do that actually?
[245:07.10]Did they do that?
[245:16.34]That was fun.
[245:18.91]No, that was really, that was good.
[245:21.93]That was rage-inducing in a lot of places, but, you know, you have to put your fucking pants on and play the game and do it.
[245:33.00]How many times did I die?
[245:33.84]Okay, I'm gonna guess like two, two like 40.
[245:37.86]240?
[245:37.88]300 plus?
[245:38.14]No, no way.
[245:54.79]Now I have to play Hotline 2.
[245:57.23]Okay, I'm going to play Hotline 2, but I want to save Hotline 2.
[246:02.72]It was 351?
[246:03.22]Yeah, I expelled all of my energy playing through this game.
[246:16.50]I could not jump right into that again.
[246:18.98]Right now.
[246:19.96]I'll get to wait a few days.
[246:21.92]You're going to shit yourself playing Hotline Miami 2.
[246:32.40]I've hit gamer fatigue.
[246:40.95]Watch the trailer for two.
[246:44.85]Hotline Miami 2 ramps up the difficulty a lot.
[246:48.92]Well, we'll give it a try.
[246:50.38]If I lose my mind, I lose my mind.
[246:52.38]It's all good.
[246:57.54]That was a neat little game.
[246:58.60]Yeah, it is.
[247:03.92]Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[247:06.44]That was just a fun game.
[247:07.60]It was very hard.
[247:09.54]Well, no, but it was.
[247:11.57]You just kind of had to learn where to go and what to do, and sometimes you don't have to do that.
[247:19.73]You can play however you want.
[247:22.77]Hey, thank you for making this game.
[247:23.97]We're going to do Mask.
[247:24.83]Phil.
[247:26.23]Louie.
[247:28.59]Let me just see.
[247:29.29]I'm curious.
[247:32.25]Let's go... Let's just open up a random chapter, because I want to see what those masks are.
[247:36.40]Just curious.
[247:44.30]Let's see.
[247:47.39]Walk fast, look further, survive a bullet.
[247:51.35]Here we go, alright.
[247:53.09]Good... I thought that just said, good shit.
[247:57.15]Walk faster.
[247:58.07]More melee weapons.
[247:59.74]Hard to spot.
[248:01.48]French translation.
[248:02.82]French translation?
[248:06.96]Why does it have an achievement for dying like that?
[248:14.37]I don't understand.
[248:15.15]French translation.
[248:16.07]Is the game just translated into French?
[248:24.65]How?
[248:25.15]What?
[248:39.19]I missed.
[248:40.15]Ah, fucking dog.
[248:41.39]Does he have to throw it?
[248:47.49]R to restart.
[248:48.17]It's not even in French.
[248:57.07]What?
[248:57.95]I didn't want to let go of that.
[248:59.43]Why is it letting it go?
[249:01.81]I'm confused right now.
[249:03.11]Am I breaking this thing on people?
[249:04.98]I am.
[249:05.24]And then you throw it.
[249:06.88]I get it.
[249:07.30]Okay.
[249:08.10]Took me the whole game to figure that out.
[249:14.68]I'm curious about this French translation though.
[249:29.84]Beat one level with French.
[249:42.53]Oh, fuck.
[249:44.81]You're not gonna... It only works on cutscenes.
[249:46.93]Oh.
[249:49.72]Alright, well.
[249:53.86]That was a fun game.
[249:57.25]There's a bonus.
[249:58.17]Play the bonus level.
[250:00.19]Which one?
[250:02.35]Bonus level.
[250:04.76]Chapter 14, 18, 19.
[250:07.32]Bonus chapter!
[250:10.52]Wait.
[250:12.24]Special chapter.
[250:13.44]What the hell is all this?
[250:15.04]Bonus chapter.
[250:15.98]Does this game ever end?
[250:25.44]Alright, I wanna go with... Hard to spot.
[250:32.91]Let's try hard to spot.
[250:47.06]Holy fuck, he chased me all the way out there.
[250:49.64]I need that French translation.
[250:55.33]Oh my god.
[250:56.07]Um, I'm dead.
[251:01.92]Whatever.
[251:05.30]Um, okay.
[251:06.80]That's a little odd.
[251:10.91]I can't shoot him out here.
[251:24.25]If I can pick that up.
[251:27.11]This isn't a guy.
[251:29.47]Is that Minecraft Steve?
[251:33.61]Fuck.
[251:34.13]He's still alive.
[251:35.13]He's still alive.
[251:53.09]I can't see that down.
[251:58.27]Oh, shit!
[251:59.07]My brain almost just... No, I need Jeffrey for this one.
[252:13.03]This is just a huge open room.
[252:14.57]I need to be able to see everything.
[252:24.85]Window.
[252:26.81]No, those aren't actual windows.
[252:27.97]Damn it, they're behind a wall.
[252:44.16]I'll get the melee.
[252:45.56]Alright, so we got a guy down here.
[252:49.83]Really?
[252:50.15]I just... Why did he not shoot me the entire time that I was doing that?
[252:53.22]What the fuck, man?
[253:05.98]Really?
[253:08.76]Guns bug when you're outside.
[253:10.00]Yeah, that's called a bunch of bologna.
[253:15.88]That's a bunch of bologna.
[253:17.68]That's like actually a fucking bologna and cheese sandwich.
[253:33.62]Is there anywhere else I can go?
[253:35.74]I guess not.
[253:37.90]I guess I have to go that way.
[253:46.35]And he gets to shoot me, but I can't shoot him.
[253:47.71]Like, fuck off.
[253:50.49]Oh my fucking... How are you... What?
[253:56.74]What?
[254:14.81]Where did he even come from?
[254:15.73]We need to find cover.
[254:40.11]Oh my god.
[254:41.54]Why the hell does that exist?
[254:43.46]Why can't Out of Bounds be back here?
[254:44.75]Why does it have to be here?
[254:55.65]Just brush inside?
[254:56.61]That's not going to work.
[254:57.37]There's guys with guns around every corner.
[254:59.61]Here and down here.
[255:02.91]These guys over here are going to shoot me.
[255:06.19]I don't know how the hell I'm going to get in here.
[255:15.68]Will the tables cover or am I going to get shot right in the face here in a second?
[255:33.01]Not.
[255:33.57]Probably not.
[255:37.55]How am I gonna hit the other guy?
[255:47.28]I'm gonna have to go like this.
[255:55.65]Can I hit him from here?
[256:05.74]Got it.
[256:06.08]Okay.
[256:07.96]Rush him.
[256:08.50]No, I don't want to rush him.
[256:11.66]This is cover.
[256:14.92]Wait, nobody comes out of their rooms down here, do they?
[256:16.63]Is there anybody?
[256:17.15]There's probably some guy in the fucking bowling alley.
[256:29.15]Holy shit!
[256:29.47]There's a guy in the bowling alley!
[256:34.86]Oh no.
[256:38.22]Oh boy, I'm in trouble.
[256:40.22]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[256:41.52]I'm dead.
[256:41.80]No, I'm not.
[256:42.26]Get a bolt.
[256:46.92]I picked up the one that didn't have any fucking bullets!
[256:50.64]Oh my god, the fucking terrible luck.
[256:53.81]The one gun that doesn't have a single bullet in it is the one that I pick up.
[256:57.49]Are you fucking serious?
[256:59.39]You've got to be kidding me.
[257:02.23]I'm so fucking annoyed by that.
[257:08.97]There were like four guns on the ground, and the one that I picked up is the one that I just let go.
[257:15.32]Oh, I'm so annoyed.
[257:16.26]I threw the rifle with bullets away?
[257:23.17]I had to!
[257:24.89]I was getting chased!
[257:36.62]Now I need to keep this.
[257:41.75]Because I just can't see anything.
[257:49.25]Where's the one where you just can't fucking die?
[257:53.59]Holy shit.
[257:54.25]Give it to me.
[258:12.12]Yeah, I'm pressing them very hard.
[258:13.80]This gigantic open room.
[258:21.53]Oh, fucking lord.
[258:24.19]I'm about to destroy my entire office with a fucking slug hammer.
[258:26.93]And I'm not even gonna put a camera on, too.
[258:29.97]So you won't even be able to capture it.
[258:31.21]You'll just hear loud crashing noises.
[258:43.64]How am I gonna get this done?
[258:44.76]I need the gun.
[258:47.18]Is there any gun down here?
[258:57.12]And I knocked him out, but that's not gonna do anything for me.
[259:00.47]I need the knife.
[259:01.13]I need the knife.
[259:02.49]Is he coming out?
[259:05.39]He's coming out!
[259:29.36]I'm so paranoid about a guy just being right there.
[259:31.38]There's a guy right here, right there!
[259:33.02]He's gonna shoot me!
[259:41.25]There's a bowling alley guy down here too.
[259:44.01]There he is.
[259:54.35]Alright, only guy in here is this one.
[259:56.65]What about across the fucking way?
[259:57.82]Yup, two guys with guns.
[259:58.76]No windows here though.
[260:01.84]Okay, go in this room, kill a guy on the toilet printer.
[260:08.66]Why is he running over here?
[260:11.44]Why are they all here?
[260:12.34]Why are they all here?
[260:24.39]alright anybody oh oh my goodness okay it's just this one guy here and that's it oh fuck one round that's not gonna cut it here man there's still somebody alive down here right no is it one guy taking a piss and then I'm done
[260:58.52]Oh, do I have to kill these guys?
[261:13.25]Nobody left, right?
[261:14.09]There's nobody sitting down.
[261:15.61]There's nobody hanging out over here, right?
[261:18.76]It's just Minecraft Steve.
[261:24.35]Thank God.
[261:26.01]Oh, Dark Lord, grant us your eternal power.
[261:29.55]Hey, Brandon.
[261:30.83]Did you hear something just now?
[261:33.43]Shut up, Willy.
[261:34.89]Not while I'm chanting.
[261:40.25]I can't get over there.
[261:44.56]That was fucking hard.
[261:46.94]Can I not do anything about this?
[261:55.61]No, I can't get in there.
[261:57.81]Oh, okay.
[262:03.49]Alright, bye.
[262:05.21]Is there another door on the other side of the bar?
[262:07.21]No.
[262:11.92]What am I gonna go do?
[262:12.90]Put her back together?
[262:13.78]Although that's fucked up.
[262:32.95]Gotta go there and tell them it's not okay.
[262:35.75]I don't think that's going to work.
[262:41.44]C plus streamer.
[262:45.62]And a dart has been unlocked.
[262:46.94]There was one more, let's take a look.
[262:52.30]So we just go backwards.
[262:54.14]So this is a bonus chapter, highball, and then special chapter called Exposed.
[263:03.93]exposed let's go with um extra ammo speaking of exposed I understand why the level is called exposed
[263:34.77]Oh, shit!
[263:56.11]Who's up here?
[263:56.77]Anybody?
[263:57.07]Two guys in this... Oh my god, more than one guy.
[264:00.09]I think it's... Okay, that's what...
[264:04.29]Oh my god, my- my- my- my asshole!
[264:08.15]I'm serious!
[264:08.91]I'm not- I don't mean to be gross here, but holy shit!
[264:15.80]What did I just pick up?
[264:34.30]Can they shoot over this?
[264:35.14]No, they can't.
[264:38.16]Okay, but he's gonna run over here.
[264:41.18]Is he gonna shoot through this?
[264:42.64]He might.
[264:43.04]Nope, okay.
[264:47.99]What about up here?
[264:48.95]Take this slow.
[264:49.61]I'm already doing well.
[264:50.57]I don't need to freak out about this.
[264:51.91]Anybody up to the top left?
[264:53.83]Doesn't look like it.
[265:04.80]Nobody else.
[265:05.32]Alright.
[265:06.18]Just a few more guys over there.
[265:14.64]I'll take the other gun because it has more rounds in it.
[265:23.57]Okay, don't try to cheese it.
[265:24.65]Just do it right.
[265:29.91]There's three guys left.
[265:30.89]One guy with a bat.
[265:36.93]for this guy first he's gonna be quick one two three that's it okay that actually was fairly easy that really wasn't that bad at all okay why is it called special mission that was uh
[266:08.34]I didn't get very many style points, but... Get it with a full combo.
[266:14.62]I'm sure there are people that play this game that can do the wild, wild shit.
[266:26.79]Alright, that's cool.
[266:27.89]Is there anything else that I missed?
[266:31.61]Is that special chapter?
[266:32.51]That's bonus chapter.
[266:34.50]The world record is 15 minutes for the whole game.
[266:41.76]This one was good.
[266:42.50]This one was... I almost lost my mind.
[266:45.90]This one, not so much though.
[266:46.84]That was... I mean, I guess for comboing and trying to find interesting routes, probably.
[266:50.90]Stream ending voice.
[267:03.26]Well, so... Pretty much.
[267:05.88]But let me explain, uh...
[267:09.79]Let me explain the deal here.
[267:11.43]So... EDF was supposed to be tonight.
[267:15.40]But if you came in a little later... I had to postpone it till tomorrow because we wanted to get... Star wanted to get ready.
[267:21.48]He didn't really have all of his shit set up.
[267:23.24]He needs to set up his PlayStation 4 and capture stuff and he wasn't really ready to do it.
[267:27.88]So we just said, alright, we'll just do it tomorrow.
[267:30.64]So today is just kind of an extra stream while we wait till tomorrow.
[267:37.71]So, EDF tomorrow with Star and Etalyx.
[267:48.04]Oh, you're throwing Star under the bus.
[267:51.02]No, I mean, I could have just played it today.
[267:55.18]Like, I could have just played EDF today.
[267:57.70]But I would rather play with people that want to play, you know what I mean?
[268:01.80]If there's a multiplayer opportunity there, and look, Star and I played the game last time, EDF4.
[268:08.15]So I obviously want to, if he wants to do it, and we want to do it, and we think it would be fun, we're going to do it.
[268:12.19]And that's what we're going to do tomorrow.
[268:13.21]He just wasn't ready today.
[268:22.96]But for the purposes of tonight, I think I'll just call it there.
[268:28.57]That was a lot of fun.
[268:32.37]I will definitely be playing Hotline Miami 2.
[268:36.36]Just not immediately.
[268:38.26]I think I need a break.
[268:42.54]Rat movies at a million views?
[268:43.80]Alright, we'll watch it before I leave.
[268:50.33]Thanks for joining me.
[268:50.99]If you're taking off, let's see you tomorrow.
[268:53.49]Probably around the same time.
[268:54.45]Around like 3 to 3.30 Pacific.
[269:00.19]EDF 5.
[269:00.89]I'm not sure how good it's going to be, but the last one was a blast.
[269:05.87]And as long as you take it for what it is, you can have a lot of fun in EDF.
[269:09.69]See you tomorrow for EDF.
[269:13.84]Let's call it there.
[269:19.83]I'm going to get that.
[269:23.51]Okie dokie.
[269:24.81]Alright.
[269:27.66]So, let's head over to the bits.
[269:30.70]From a few four and a half hours ago or so.
[269:38.44]Yeah, hope you join us tomorrow.
[269:41.02]And then, after tomorrow...
[269:44.03]the let me take a look at the because just today is kind of pushed a couple things forward so the birdhouse stream was going to be on Friday but because I'm streaming tomorrow so that'll be Monday Tuesday Wednesday so I'm gonna take Thursday and Friday off and then the birdhouse stream will be on Saturday
[270:11.09]Birdhouse in the winter.
[270:13.57]I need to make a birdhouse, okay?
[270:19.78]Alright, we'll watch Rat Movie at the end.
[270:25.14]That'll be the sign-off for the night.
[270:29.92]Are there even any birds in Vegas?
[270:33.41]I'm just realizing this right now.
[270:34.67]Are there birds here?
[270:40.03]There might not be any birds here.
[270:47.56]Have you ever really seen a bird?
[270:50.80]Yes, many times.
[270:55.30]What the fuck, Jerma lives in Vegas now.
[270:57.08]Yes.
[270:58.38]I moved a few months ago from Massachusetts to Las Vegas.
[271:06.61]Turkeys.
[271:07.25]No, there are no turkeys in Las Vegas, I can assure you that.
[271:10.87]I haven't seen one.
[271:13.47]It was last month?
[271:16.31]Um... I got here... on... in October.
[271:26.20]The wind took me around a bunch.
[271:29.80]When did we land?
[271:37.59]At some point.
[271:40.37]Yeah, so it'll be about three months when we get to the first or second week in January.
[271:48.77]How long are you gonna keep up the balloon charade?
[271:54.03]I broadcasted it, so it's real.
[271:55.95]It's real.
[271:56.61]I did it.
[272:03.08]Anyways, thank you to Gaming Hash for the $2.50.
[272:04.66]They say nice.
[272:06.84]Hey, nice.
[272:08.48]Stix Renegade, thanks for the dollar.
[272:09.71]So I was getting a snack in the vending machine and I was about to pay via Apple Pay.
[272:14.29]I dropped my phone and tried to catch it.
[272:16.21]I involuntarily stuck my foot out.
[272:18.24]I kicked the screen and broke it.
[272:21.88]That doesn't sound like a good thing.
[272:28.31]I hope it wasn't a nice phone, because that's a pain in the ass to repair.
[272:31.77]But I'm sorry to hear that sticks.
[272:35.15]ExtraCheesy, thanks for the $1.
[272:36.41]Hey Jerem, I'm sorry for the low-brow, edgy, crab-related constellation joke I made yesterday.
[272:40.90]Please don't annihilate me.
[272:42.70]I can do better, I swear.
[272:46.95]Low-brow.
[272:48.21]Wow, this is a high-brow stream.
[272:52.22]Although I did just say that my, like, something about my asshole, uh, like, 13, 14 minutes ago.
[273:04.45]But yeah, let's say, um, let's put Jot Hotline Miami 2 down for next week.
[273:12.87]Because that actually was a lot of fun.
[273:17.32]I'm actually into that.
[273:19.22]I'm into it right now.
[273:23.77]But thank you, ExtraCheesy, and don't worry about it.
[273:25.73]It's alright.
[273:26.17]Thank you, Divus, for the three bucks.
[273:27.69]Every stream, Divus.
[273:30.29]Every stream.
[273:31.37]That's gonna add up after a while.
[273:33.31]But thank you so much.
[273:37.77]Uh, PeacefulHaley, thanks for the one dollar.
[273:39.27]Hey, Jerma, I'm turning 21 tomorrow and unfortunately can't go to Vegas.
[273:43.28]But that's okay.
[273:44.06]I've been trying to pursue my passion with streaming on Twitch.
[273:48.04]I think I'm doing okay.
[273:48.92]Hopefully I can make this a career someday.
[273:52.14]Love you, Jerma.
[273:54.11]I wish you the best of luck.
[273:57.22]It's a tough world out here.
[273:59.76]In Twitch.
[274:01.06]Very competitive atmosphere.
[274:04.92]Especially nowadays.
[274:06.02]I get asked for advice on streaming and... It's hard to give advice.
[274:19.11]And hard to...
[274:21.12]Kind of say, hey, this is how you should do it.
[274:22.61]Because I don't really have an answer.
[274:29.93]Here's my advice.
[274:30.81]Good luck.
[274:33.37]That's not what I mean.
[274:34.01]What I mean is... Everybody does it differently.
[274:38.11]And it's hard to replicate somebody else's... What somebody else did is not necessarily a recipe for success.
[274:47.29]I know a lot of people compare themselves to other people, and it's hard not to, but you can't.
[274:53.20]You just gotta do you, and hope that you can maybe gain some viewers, and if you do, you do.
[275:05.71]I wish anybody the utmost luck when they try to get into a passion or try to get into content creation.
[275:22.36]Are you saying that this person is trying to steal your shtick?
[275:24.90]No, no, I'm just, in a general sense, uh... A lot of times you compare yourselves to other people and you... Oh, how'd they do that?
[275:34.88]How did they do those things?
[275:39.11]Steal your shtick.
[275:41.05]No.
[275:42.77]What?
[275:49.55]When am I gonna get a Vive?
[275:50.73]Uh, probably like a few years.
[275:55.22]But no, good luck.
[276:00.41]I don't know what games you play or what you do on your streams, but hopefully you have fun doing it, because that's important as well.
[276:08.67]You have to make sure the first thing that's on that list is, are you enjoying what you're doing?
[276:15.39]The whole career aspect happens after that, you know?
[276:20.37]I think a lot of times people get into content creation, they're like, alright, I can't wait to do this for a job.
[276:25.90]But you have to be realistic, you know?
[276:27.34]It should go the other way around.
[276:34.86]As long as you keep an open mind and you don't... Because I mean, when I first started my YouTube channel, it was based on, I just kind of do this and I want to do this.
[276:46.60]It wasn't about a career or choosing a career.
[276:50.28]It just kind of happened.
[277:00.16]Just make sure that you are doing what you want to do.
[277:05.20]And you're having fun doing it.
[277:07.25]And try to set realistic goals for yourself.
[277:10.35]Even if that means on a week-by-week basis or a month-by-month basis.
[277:21.81]Hopefully, you could maybe take something from that.
[277:25.35]I'm not an expert.
[277:26.33]I really don't claim to be.
[277:27.81]I'm not an expert on, here's how you market yourself, and here's how you do this.
[277:31.66]No, I don't fucking know.
[277:34.60]You know what I mean?
[277:42.20]What's the point of slow mode?
[277:45.15]Make it so the chat goes slower.
[277:50.34]But with that being said, we will move on.
[277:52.88]Good luck.
[277:53.22]Peaceful Haley.
[277:56.58]Thank you for the $1.
[277:58.55]Thank you, Lakronda, for the $5.
[278:00.13]Jerma, I have been listening to you since middle school.
[278:03.23]It's been a long six years.
[278:05.23]And I can't thank you enough on how much your streams and videos have impacted me.
[278:07.71]Much love.
[278:12.31]Thanks.
[278:13.27]Thank you, Lakronda.
[278:17.22]It's a shock on a daily basis when I hear people say things like that.
[278:24.59]I'm incredibly happy that you can take anything from this stream.
[278:28.01]Or from the videos that I've ever made.
[278:29.45]So, thank you.
[278:35.55]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[278:36.61]Jerma quick.
[278:37.13]Duck.
[278:37.53]Duck before it's too late.
[278:40.52]Duck?
[278:41.32]Like, in the game?
[278:42.04]What are you talking about?
[278:43.22]Duck.
[278:45.06]That's fucking... Alright.
[278:46.28]Alright.
[278:48.16]You can't duck in Hotline Miami.
[278:54.87]Wholesome content.
[279:03.42]He has headphones on.
[279:04.74]I don't even have my headphones in right now.
[279:11.09]But thank you, Dr. Clay, for the warning four hours ago.
[279:14.93]I didn't duck four hours ago.
[279:17.25]And... I don't know.
[279:20.39]Was this a streamer that mentioned his ass?
[279:21.87]Yes, it is.
[279:23.72]Wholesome, in quotes.
[279:25.10]I don't... I don't live by labels, man.
[279:28.20]I just... You know what I mean?
[279:28.96]I just do me.
[279:32.02]Labels?
[279:32.68]Get rid of them.
[279:39.25]Yeah.
[279:41.19]Yeah!
[279:42.49]That's too much coffee.
[279:43.25]I'm not drinking anymore.
[279:45.27]Why am I drinking coffee at 9 o'clock at night?
[279:47.01]What am I, my fucking mother?
[279:49.41]My mother drinks like three coffees a day and she'll sip on one at like 11 o'clock at night to go to bed.
[279:54.51]I'm turning into my mother.
[280:01.67]Anyways, thank you, Dr. Clay.
[280:03.05]Thank you, ExtraCheesy, for the $1 watch, and you formulate possible strategies and play this game.
[280:07.24]It's sort of like if there was a model of Terminator whose processor was an old Texas Instruments grade school calculator.
[280:14.88]Thank you, ExtraCheesy, but I beat it, and it only took about 4 hours and 10 minutes to beat it.
[280:20.23]So, come on.
[280:21.43]I only died like 265 times.
[280:24.65]That's pretty good.
[280:25.73]I got B's and C's.
[280:26.91]That's- at the very beginning of the stream, we made sure to talk about B's and C's are okay.
[280:31.21]I didn't get any F's.
[280:31.99]I didn't get any D's.
[280:38.16]Thank you, Extra Cheese.
[280:38.80]Thank you, Swiggity Swanky, for the $1.
[280:40.20]What do I happen to wanting to play a relaxing game before EDF tomorrow?
[280:43.78]This game will take a year off of your life.
[280:45.48]It absolutely did.
[280:47.14]But I think it was worth it.
[280:47.96]It was fun.
[280:50.38]Chubbiest Thread, thanks for the $20.
[280:51.96]They just say FailFish, FailFish.
[280:58.72]FailFish, FailFish.
[281:00.96]I must have done something worth facepalming for.
[281:05.10]But thank you for the $20.
[281:08.50]Really appreciate that.
[281:09.22]Thank you so much.
[281:11.38]Peanut Chan, $50.
[281:13.84]Big money from Peanut Chan.
[281:14.92]Thank you again if you're still here.
[281:17.39]FlankTank gave $5.
[281:19.01]So I was watching this random vid from my YouTube homepage and I had to double take it.
[281:22.75]You are now famous.
[281:23.73]What are you talking about?
[281:33.06]Let's turn this down for a second.
[281:41.07]Oh, I gotta get out of this.
[281:43.01]Hold on a second.
[281:45.06]You were on Ellen.
[281:46.70]Can you imagine if I was?
[281:47.62]Imagine she was like, okay, so let's take a look at this weird guy.
[281:52.52]He's kind of a weirdo.
[281:53.63]Here he is on the screen there.
[281:54.71]And he just gets up and starts dancing.
[281:56.37]And it's me, like, doing the Fortnite dance.
[282:00.87]So next up on the program, we have kind of a weirdo.
[282:03.87]He's a weirdo.
[282:04.69]Here he is.
[282:05.47]You know, I like him, though.
[282:06.25]He's a really nice guy.
[282:07.67]But there he is, Jerma.
[282:09.19]What a weirdo.
[282:09.69]Jerma985.
[282:19.58]Odyssey DLC after a year.
[282:21.50]And you know what happens?
[282:22.84]Someone goes, fuck you.
[282:24.30]I'm making my own kingdoms then.
[282:26.01]And I'm making Bob-omb Battlefield 2 for good measure.
[282:28.69]And because Nintendo cracks down so hard on game tampering, the only way you can really access this kind of stuff is through homebrewing.
[282:35.83]Only to ironically be sanctioned.
[282:38.02]Only to ironically be sanctioned.
[282:39.72]Why am I being linked?
[282:40.66]What did he say?
[282:42.12]Nintendo wants everything that's made to be sanctioned under their own approval.
[282:46.22]But then they don't give people what they want.
[282:48.16]For example,
[282:48.92]Oh, I've walked by on the green screen.
[282:51.38]What the fuck?
[282:56.61]I just walked by on the green screen.
[283:00.77]What?
[283:03.53]Why?
[283:03.97]What the fuck?
[283:04.83]That's fucking funny.
[283:09.09]I didn't even pick up on it.
[283:10.18]I didn't even see it.
[283:19.81]That's wild.
[283:22.45]Funkeem also made a green screen video.
[283:27.07]And it was fucking wild.
[283:34.86]But anyways, thank you, Flank Tank.
[283:37.62]Flank Tank.
[283:39.18]For the $1.
[283:39.82]Craft Tech, thanks for the $1.
[283:40.96]They say hello, hello.
[283:42.90]Flank Tank, again, for the $1.
[283:44.32]Nightbot deleted my bit message because it had a link, and I was not a sub, so I had to sub, and there it is again.
[283:49.78]Oh, Jesus.
[283:52.31]Well, thank you, Flank Tank, for your $12 here.
[283:53.73]$11.
[283:53.75]And for sharing the link.
[283:55.33]Thank you.
[284:08.41]That was, yeah, that was interesting.
[284:11.03]Somebody wrote, I was looking at the Reddit maybe like a few weeks ago or two weeks ago or something, and somebody wrote, I don't think he realizes just how, like, how he's going to appear all over the place now.
[284:25.77]Like, even people that don't even, and I thought about this too, it's like, even people that don't even know this channel or watch this channel, somewhere on some page or some website, just, oh, free green screen footage.
[284:37.83]I'm just gonna appear in random fucked up shit, random crazy shit, random videos.
[284:42.71]I have no control over it.
[284:45.57]It's, I have no idea.
[284:46.77]It's, like, seven years from now, I'm gonna be fucking chadwalking on somebody's random video.
[284:58.96]20 years are gonna go by.
[284:59.82]My hair's gonna be white.
[285:02.98]And I'm gonna be doing, like, the Disney Channel opening for some new, like, up-and-coming YouTuber in, like, 25 years.
[285:16.81]What hair?
[285:17.35]It's gonna be nice.
[285:18.05]It's gonna be white.
[285:21.05]It's gonna be slicked back with grease.
[285:23.66]I'm gonna get just like... I'm gonna just get like oil, like olive oil and just slick it back.
[285:29.33]Bright white.
[285:37.52]But thank you.
[285:39.47]Thank you to Darkstar 700,000 Games.
[285:41.79]Thanks for the $1.
[285:42.47]I have a Python practical exam tomorrow and I'm afraid all the programming knowledge I've accumulated throughout the semester will leave my head the moment I walk in the classroom.
[285:50.84]Wish me luck.
[285:53.08]No, you think that, but you'll be fine.
[285:55.46]You'll wake up tomorrow after being like, oh shit, you'll sit down, the paper will be in front of you and you'll just pull it out of your memory.
[286:02.51]That's how it works.
[286:03.19]Just get some good sleep.
[286:04.99]That's one thing a lot of people, a big mistake people make when they're in college is they prioritize
[286:13.30]cramming all night before the exam and getting 45 minutes of sleep and then just slumbering just to class with your eyes half closed and then you're just delirious and you actually do better your mind retains information when you have a full night's rest to process and kind of break it all down get a good night's sleep
[286:43.07]Go over some basic stuff when you wake up.
[286:45.25]It's better for you if you do it that way.
[286:51.52]Don't sleep so your memory doesn't escape from your ear as you lay in bed.
[287:03.01]I skipped a good night's sleep to watch your stream.
[287:10.40]Don't tell me what to do.
[287:11.47]Hey, some people, some people it works.
[287:14.21]It never worked for me.
[287:16.09]I would get better grades when I just was sitting there going, okay, so I have this, this is all the stuff I need to remember.
[287:22.31]I kind of know it, but let me just, let me just like go over it and repeat over and over again information for fucking 12 hours and then like go to class.
[287:31.20]Wait, what?
[287:31.82]I forget.
[287:33.66]What if you just go to sleep and you study a little bit?
[287:36.51]Don't, I'm not saying don't study.
[287:38.43]Get some good knowledge in your head.
[287:40.71]Eat a good dinner.
[287:42.43]And I'm talking fish.
[287:43.97]Eat fish before dinner.
[287:45.79]And then go to sleep.
[287:46.97]Wake up and eat some more fish.
[287:48.69]You want like salmon.
[287:50.47]You want tuna fish before you go to bed.
[287:52.19]And then you want salmon in the morning.
[288:00.69]You want those omega-3s to be just... I can't do it.
[288:05.59]I can't go high anymore.
[288:07.10]I really am getting old.
[288:09.28]Let's try that again.
[288:14.90]You want those omega-3s in your head to go... See?
[288:19.91]Fuck, I still got it.
[288:21.47]So then, when the omega-3s go into your neuro area, it's much easier for memory, for cognitive ability.
[288:32.33]It's great.
[288:33.27]Fish, eat salmon tonight if you have a final tomorrow.
[288:45.26]Omega-3, is that a new Steam game?
[288:47.26]No, it's for your brain.
[288:50.96]Anyways.
[288:53.66]Good luck on your finals, guys.
[288:56.51]Where am I gonna buy salmon at 12 p.m.?
[288:58.95]At the grocery store at 12 p.m.?
[289:02.83]You're talking about 12 a.m.
[289:07.17]No, and do not supplement this with like a Filet-O-Fish from McDonald's.
[289:10.46]That's not the same thing.
[289:12.85]You may as well eat cardboard with fish flavoring.
[289:15.07]That's not the same deal.
[289:16.47]Don't do that.
[289:23.77]Oh, he said to eat fish.
[289:24.59]I'm gonna eat like four filet of fishes and have diarrhea in the morning.
[289:27.59]That's not gonna help you.
[289:36.60]That's gonna be bad.
[289:41.26]And if you can't get fish, then eat a bunch of macaroni tomorrow morning.
[289:48.26]Load up on some carbs.
[289:49.95]Carb out in the morning.
[289:51.05]So you just get brain.
[289:52.33]You got like the energy.
[289:53.23]You know what I mean?
[290:00.11]No, lose the cheese.
[290:01.15]Lose the cheese.
[290:01.93]Don't put cheese on that.
[290:04.19]Just macaroni, cooked macaroni, drizzle a bunch of olive oil on, sprinkle a little bit of, maybe a little bit of parmesan.
[290:10.80]You know what I mean?
[290:12.12]Parmesan.
[290:12.80]Parmesan.
[290:15.06]Am I saying that right?
[290:15.98]Parmesan.
[290:17.08]Parmigiano.
[290:18.56]It's parmigiano, right?
[290:21.42]How do you actually say that word correctly?
[290:29.19]It's like parmigiano, right?
[290:36.97]That's the correct pronoun.
[290:38.19]It's not Parmesan, right?
[290:39.57]It's like Parmigiano.
[290:47.14]Yeah, it's Parmigiano-Reggiano, right?
[290:51.12]Okay, good.
[290:56.01]Boomer pronunciation.
[291:06.67]Well, that's how they, that's what they do.
[291:07.79]That's how they do it on the Food Network.
[291:10.13]When I watch Chopped, the guy's like, okay, so, uh, what we got, what's in the basket?
[291:15.83]Well, I've got a, what I've got here is I've got a salmon steak.
[291:19.75]I've got some, uh, some salsa.
[291:21.91]And then what's over here where I got some, uh, parmigiano-reggiano.
[291:24.43]Okay.
[291:24.69]I'm like, alright, now I know how to say that now.
[291:40.49]Why is it always the same three judges?
[291:42.55]Because they're experts.
[291:51.15]Food Network uses fake ingredients, what?
[292:05.84]Hey, how you doing?
[292:06.50]Can I get a sausage mushroom pizza?
[292:08.70]What the fuck are you talking about?
[292:21.36]Why would you put that in all caps?
[292:24.95]What if you're not watching Guy Fieri?
[292:26.19]I've seen every single episode of Dinah's Drive-Ins and Dives.
[292:28.31]Every single one.
[292:34.73]There's not one episode I've missed.
[292:41.10]What happens in episode 34?
[292:42.26]He goes, this?
[292:44.12]That's killer.
[292:45.56]You knocked it out of the park, man.
[292:55.83]I just, there it is.
[293:00.37]Anyways, thank you to Drosophilia for the $1.
[293:02.80]Hey Jerma, I used to use a Razer DeathAdder for a few years, but the clicks started messing up and I had to get a new mouse.
[293:09.66]I've been using a PicTech mouse for several months now.
[293:12.30]It's insanely good for how cheap it is.
[293:14.96]And I promise the customization software isn't malware.
[293:30.25]Thank you, Terosophilia.
[293:33.85]I just got this, though.
[293:34.89]That's the worst part.
[293:38.21]And then they say I'm not sponsored, I swear.
[293:41.47]I didn't think you were.
[293:43.55]It's alright.
[293:46.51]Uh, Drummagedor.
[293:50.93]Drummagedor.
[293:52.47]Thanks for the $10.
[293:53.57]Greetings from Finland.
[293:54.89]Glad to see you playing one of my favorite games of all time.
[293:56.70]I hope you'll suffer through the second one too.
[293:59.96]That one also has a hard mode.
[294:01.42]I probably will never do it.
[294:08.64]But thank you for the $10.
[294:09.52]I really appreciate it.
[294:13.19]I hope you'll suffer.
[294:22.52]Thank you.
[294:24.77]Parfallamule, thanks for the one dollar.
[294:26.43]Can you be my father for five minutes, please?
[294:30.69]How about five seconds?
[294:34.46]Son?
[294:37.90]Okay.
[294:38.56]Thank you to one demonic cucumber, thanks for the one dollar.
[294:44.75]Hey Jeremy, I'm here to say, here to pay my comedy dues.
[294:47.11]I'm in a worse place than last month but your streams are pulling me through.
[294:50.22]Thank you for the wonderful community.
[294:51.32]P.S.
[294:51.64]Anyone else think that the Jex emote looks like a guy doing coke?
[295:00.30]What?
[295:04.60]I don't think so.
[295:05.26]This looks like my face.
[295:12.53]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[295:16.17]Sorry to hear that you're in a bad place.
[295:20.29]Take care of yourself.
[295:22.28]Thanks for sticking around.
[295:23.70]Hopefully you get better and feel better soon.
[295:32.35]Thank you.
[295:33.83]For the one dollar.
[295:36.20]And Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[295:37.74]Hey, remember when Demon Lord Zaraxos played Five Nights at Freddy's?
[295:41.02]I do and I won't let you forget.
[295:42.90]Yeah, that is a video that I did not delete.
[295:46.98]Or did I?
[295:47.42]I may have deleted that.
[295:52.66]Yeah, that video exists, I think.
[296:02.20]Does it still exist?
[296:03.04]It might not.
[296:03.81]It's still up.
[296:05.03]No, it's not.
[296:18.25]Alright, we're going to watch this video right now.
[296:19.63]Because this is going to be fucking painful for me, but maybe not.
[296:25.06]We'll see.
[296:26.50]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[296:37.73]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[296:40.43]It's me, Demon Lord Saraxos, here.
[296:43.57]You're probably wondering, where's Jerma?
[296:45.59]What happened to him?
[296:46.55]How come he's not doing this video?
[296:48.57]Well, it's because I have taken over his soul, and I will only release it after playing a round of Five Nights at Freddy's.
[296:57.36]Because everyone wants to see Five Nights at Freddy's, and who better than...
[297:04.56]The Lord of all hells and demons and hatred.
[297:08.52]I'm not scared of anything.
[297:09.84]What could I possibly be afraid of in this little shit game?
[297:14.32]I don't know.
[297:15.10]We'll find out very shortly.
[297:16.62]Let's go ahead and play a new game.
[297:17.92]This guy sounds kind of like an asshole.
[297:28.21]I'm going to ignore him.
[297:31.84]Let's go camera 4B.
[297:33.34]That's what we're on.
[297:35.31]It's too stretched.
[297:36.11]Hold on.
[297:36.71]Let me reset it then.
[297:43.05]So how come it's not happening over here?
[297:48.02]It has to be stretched, apparently.
[297:49.50]It's supposed to be 1080, man.
[297:52.90]Oh, whatever.
[297:53.28]You get the idea.
[297:59.49]Let me turn this off.
[298:00.41]Okay.
[298:04.28]Camera 5.
[298:05.80]It's in full screen.
[298:11.05]There's a bird.
[298:12.95]I don't like birds.
[298:14.17]Oh, this sucks.
[298:15.89]Camera 1A.
[298:18.69]Camera 7.
[298:21.05]Put it down.
[298:22.45]There's a door.
[298:25.54]I can close the door.
[298:28.98]What the fuck was that?
[298:32.07]Okay, well, that was a little weird.
[298:33.53]That was like a bird in my face.
[298:35.77]I wasn't scared.
[298:36.85]I was not scared at that.
[298:38.35]I was just startled at it.
[298:39.57]It jumped up at me and it scared me.
[298:41.60]So, obviously, that'll scare you.
[298:44.20]I wasn't... Don't think that I was scared, though.
[298:46.48]Because, like, you were scared.
[298:48.28]I wasn't the one that was scared.
[298:49.50]It was you, actually.
[298:51.06]And you look... There's a blinking light over there now.
[298:56.02]This has 300,000 views.
[298:57.90]I'm embarrassed.
[298:59.74]Where are you, Freddy?
[299:02.21]You can't hide from Demon Lord Zaraxos.
[299:05.79]I will boil you.
[299:07.07]I will eat your flesh and tear off the bones and use them as toothpicks in my stew.
[299:14.75]If you think I'm going to be scared of your... One of them is missing.
[299:19.77]Okay, one of them is missing.
[299:20.97]Now, there was a rhinoceros that was here before, and he just ain't here.
[299:25.55]This bear might have moved.
[299:29.49]I might have seen him somewhere.
[299:31.43]I don't know.
[299:32.05]Pirate Cove's out of order.
[299:34.65]Let's just go back and make sure there's nobody potentially trying to kill me.
[299:40.00]But I will kill them first.
[299:41.54]That's what you need to remember from this whole thing.
[299:43.84]I will kill them first before they try to kill me.
[299:46.32]We're halfway through this video.
[299:47.52]There is a guy standing there.
[299:49.52]There is a guy in a funny little suit standing there now.
[299:54.73]And I don't really know what to do.
[299:56.59]Should I... He's still there.
[299:58.37]Okay.
[300:00.89]I cut it.
[300:01.37]It was so boring.
[300:02.55]I had to like, oh, let's keep going.
[300:04.21]The night's almost over.
[300:04.99]I only have 3% power, so that means the cameras are all going to turn off and we're going to all go to sleep.
[300:10.61]It's going to be a nice, fun day at Freddy's Pizza Place Pizzeria.
[300:15.36]Right?
[300:19.76]What the hell is that?
[300:20.74]What the hell's going on?
[300:23.04]What the hell's going on?
[300:25.73]It's time to open the store.
[300:27.17]The pizzas are opening.
[300:35.71]Oh, there's more.
[300:36.73]Why would you work here?
[300:38.55]Who would work at an establishment where you could actually get killed by the people, the participants in the suits?
[300:46.05]I don't know why you would ever do such a thing.
[300:49.02]You come work for me.
[300:50.78]At least there's benefits down in hell.
[300:53.48]You know, you get a good dental plan.
[300:55.38]You get good dental.
[300:56.80]It's pretty good.
[300:57.30]You know, we're going to continue.
[300:59.36]I'm going to get past.
[301:00.38]I don't even know what the goal here is.
[301:03.48]Do not see him anywhere.
[301:04.68]Where is he?
[301:05.42]He's in the kitchen.
[301:07.34]He's in the kitchen.
[301:08.26]Son of a bitch is in the kitchen.
[301:09.20]We're doing the same thing again.
[301:13.14]That means he's coming out here.
[301:15.78]Yeah, he's in the kitchen.
[301:17.82]No, he's in this one.
[301:18.78]Oh, wait, by the way, I remember this video.
[301:20.87]I actually have a distinct memory.
[301:23.41]This video had a lot of dislikes.
[301:26.49]I remember uploading it and after, those of you guys that don't know about like YouTubing and making videos, I would sit there after an upload and I would go, oh, okay, let me see, did it publish correctly?
[301:40.27]Did it go into sub feeds?
[301:42.00]And what are people saying?
[301:42.96]And okay, like the first hour or so of video being live, I just, I kind of hung out to see what people were saying and how it was being judged and what people were saying about it.
[301:51.86]And like 40 dislikes came in really quickly.
[301:55.68]And that was a lot.
[301:56.64]I remember back here, this is back when I think the channel had maybe like 100,000 subs, 125,000 subs at that point.
[302:07.08]So I was not used to like 100 dislikes over the course of the first hour.
[302:12.68]And I remember going, what do I do about this?
[302:14.14]Do I delete this video?
[302:15.34]Should I delete this video?
[302:16.10]I actually was going to delete this video.
[302:18.10]Okay, now he's right here.
[302:18.90]He's going to be right here.
[302:22.54]No, he's not right here.
[302:23.50]Where is he?
[302:25.38]Oh, okay, he's right here.
[302:26.88]He's literally staring at me.
[302:28.80]It's 4 a.m.
[302:29.86]Don't let them come in.
[302:32.96]Do not let them come in.
[302:33.94]It's door locked.
[302:34.89]All the doors are closed.
[302:38.35]You stay where you are.
[302:40.17]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[302:44.11]None of that.
[302:45.65]We're not going to have any of that.
[302:47.13]I must have had, like, nothing to make for a video today.
[302:50.74]Boys.

[303:30.08]You know what?
[303:30.60]I'm just going to go play Super Mario Brothers.
[303:34.30]Because that game, I don't want to play this anymore.
[303:38.32]Jerma, Jerma, your soul is now free.
[303:41.96]I'm releasing you.
[303:43.48]Why?
[303:44.44]Whoa, where?
[303:47.44]What happened?
[303:48.04]Well, just calm down, calm down.
[303:49.18]Everything's okay.
[303:49.84]Everything's alright.
[303:50.48]I have it under control.
[303:51.82]I stole your soul so I could come to Earth to play Five Nights at Freddy's.
[304:02.62]Oh, that sucked.
[304:05.54]Alright, I'm deleting that video.
[304:14.21]I'm deleting.
[304:21.64]It's deleted.
[304:30.70]Alright, anyways, let's, uh, we're almost at the end of the bits here.
[304:37.76]Thank you to... Thank you, Smellyboy, for reminding us of that video.
[304:44.05]Demonicucumber, thanks for the one dollar.
[304:45.87]Two dollars, actually, here.
[304:46.77]I was introducing your streams to my mom on the way, uh, to therapy yesterday.
[304:51.27]She really liked the videos.
[304:52.63]Also, we both agree that you look really attractive for 33.
[304:56.96]Anyway, keep up the good work, Mr. Boomer.
[305:02.68]Alright.
[305:04.36]For 33.
[305:08.80]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber, for the $1.
[305:11.70]Ugly old man.
[305:12.57]Come on, get out of here.
[305:16.55]Boomer is attractive to mother.
[305:18.91]Oh, come on.
[305:22.27]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber, for the $1.
[305:24.07]Thank you, Leather Jacket, for the $5.
[305:25.18]I've been waiting for this day for a long time.
[305:28.94]Good to see you play one of my all-time favorites.
[305:33.09]That was good.
[305:33.97]That was really fun.
[305:36.41]That was a great game.
[305:38.45]Thank you, Leatherjacket, for the $5.
[305:40.60]And for being in the game.
[305:42.44]That was you.
[305:44.66]DemonicCucumber again says, Thanks for the $1.
[305:47.44]Loud crashing noises should be the name of your autobiography.
[305:54.89]Claire of Astora, thanks for the $4.
[305:57.41]So when is Hotline Miami 2 planned to be played?
[306:02.71]Uh, I would probably say next week.
[306:06.11]Next week.
[306:08.13]Maybe that's the first thing we'll do next week.
[306:10.55]Is just start with that and play it.
[306:11.90]Let's see.
[306:12.48]How long is it?
[306:13.58]Lengthwise compared to the first one.
[306:23.28]That was about four and a half hours.
[306:26.51]It's a little bit longer.
[306:27.21]It's like three times as long.
[306:28.73]Really?
[306:31.11]Way longer.
[306:33.42]So what is it?
[306:33.86]Is it like a 10 to 12 hour game?
[306:35.48]8 to 10?
[306:41.43]Alright, we might be able to do that in one stream.
[306:44.35]I might just completely hunker down.
[306:47.75]Why didn't EDF happen tonight?
[306:49.23]I pushed it to tomorrow because we wanted to make sure that we could get the party of three that we wanted.
[306:55.98]We wanted to play with a party of three.
[307:00.52]So, I didn't want to just play by myself or... Or just one person if it's more fun with like three or four.
[307:06.62]So we have... It's happening tomorrow.
[307:11.90]Yes, star on Etalyx.
[307:13.43]Those are the two.
[307:16.85]Thank you to PeelPeelPeeling for the five dollars.
[307:18.97]No message.
[307:19.45]Thanks for five bucks.
[307:21.59]DinkyDuper, thanks for one dollar.
[307:22.95]Had a lot of fun watching your PG Hotline Miami stream tonight.
[307:27.75]PG?
[307:31.35]I've actually never played it either.
[307:33.03]By the way, what the hell was with that missing easy shots joke?
[307:37.31]Maybe I'm not boober enough to get it.
[307:39.55]Have a great night.
[307:40.78]Man, excited for tomorrow.
[307:48.42]Well, whatever.
[307:50.80]Thank you, Dinky Dooper.
[307:51.68]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam for the $1.
[307:53.32]Back to your regularly scheduled bookstore conversation.
[307:56.97]What?
[307:58.55]Oh, right.
[307:59.25]Okay.
[308:01.21]Thank you to PLP appealing again for $5.
[308:05.08]I hate to get up in the morning.
[308:06.86]Me too.
[308:07.52]What time do you get up?
[308:08.62]At six o'clock.
[308:09.68]Why do you get up so early?
[308:10.86]I have to be at work by seven.
[308:12.56]I don't get up until eight.
[308:13.94]You're lucky.
[308:14.82]What do you do?
[308:15.74]I own a bookstore.
[308:16.98]What time does your store open?
[308:18.43]At 830.
[308:18.59]I hate to get up.
[308:23.08]I hate to get up in the morning.
[308:24.84]Me too.
[308:25.50]What time do you get up?
[308:26.60]At 6 o'clock.
[308:27.66]Why do you get up so early?
[308:28.84]I have to be at work by 7.
[308:30.56]I don't get up until 8.

[308:33.72]I own a bookstore.
[308:34.98]What time does your store open?
[308:36.42]At 8.30.
[308:39.86]The best part about Daily English TV, which is the best YouTube channel I think that currently exists, this video has 39 views.
[308:54.74]Daily English TV.
[308:57.80]What a great channel.
[309:01.89]Link it so you can have more than 30 now.
[309:03.93]Yeah, and probably all of them are from this channel.
[309:08.45]But, thank you.
[309:11.90]To Timmy Tim Tam.
[309:14.40]But, peel, peel, peeling, thanks for $5 again.
[309:16.70]Boulder City here.
[309:18.97]You'll be- you'll become more native when you see a stream of quail run across the road.
[309:24.27]A stream of quail.
[309:32.20]Run across the road.
[309:38.04]Sub- oh yeah, you definitely should sub to that channel.
[309:48.20]Quails are like ducks, right?
[309:51.87]Quail's like a mix between a duck and a chickadee.
[309:54.11]Am I correct?
[310:02.57]Aren't they like little mini ducks?
[310:07.19]Quail.
[310:07.53]Okay, quail.
[310:15.24]Quail.
[310:18.90]Yeah, look at this weird bird.
[310:20.10]It's like a duck chickadee thing.
[310:24.11]It looks- type in chickadee into Google.
[310:29.25]You type in chickadee, and you tell me that that's not a chicka- that's like a weird duck chickadee.
[310:39.60]I'm sorry guys, but that's a duck chickadee.
[310:52.31]That's a- that's a duckity.
[310:53.71]Uh, thank you, P-P-Peeling.
[310:59.67]Watch out for those quails.
[311:00.83]Thanks for the five dollars.
[311:02.85]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the one dollar.
[311:04.25]No message, thank you.
[311:06.18]Dr. Clay, thanks for the one dollar.
[311:07.76]Thank you.
[311:08.50]I was hoping you would literally duck in real life.
[311:10.60]I was trying to make a time travel joke, but it failed.
[311:13.68]Anyway, take care.
[311:16.24]Uh, thank you, Maisykit, for the one dollar.
[311:18.96]They say reasonable Frieza.
[311:26.33]It's Frieza from Dragon Ball Z. Set reasonable goals for yourself, but remember it's okay to take a break if you need it.
[311:32.46]Wholesome Frieza.
[311:33.40]Did he say this in the show?
[311:37.86]I own a bookstore.
[311:41.66]He did.
[311:41.94]That's interesting.
[311:43.14]I thought he was, like, evil.
[311:46.60]Well, I guess, whatever.
[311:47.93]Okay.
[311:50.51]KXZ501, thanks for the $10.
[311:51.81]Thank you, KXZ.
[311:57.73]Great watching you power through Hotline Miami.
[312:00.03]Looked like a tough fight, but you did good, friend.
[312:02.63]Plus, it'll be good training for Hotline Miami 2, so be ready for that.
[312:08.06]LOL.
[312:09.16]L-U-L.
[312:15.86]I am looking forward to it and not looking forward to it at the same time.
[312:20.00]It's going to be very interesting.
[312:23.70]But really appreciate the $10 here, man.
[312:25.49]Thank you.
[312:27.64]Mr. Pigeon, thanks for the $1.
[312:29.14]Hey, I hope the bald thing isn't getting to you.
[312:31.93]For 30, your hair is doing incredibly well.
[312:34.99]I'm 20, and it's happening to me.
[312:37.01]You have an iron brain for not letting it get to you, bud.
[312:42.52]No, it's alright.
[312:43.74]We just fuck around on this channel.
[312:45.06]Everyone's just having fun.
[312:47.08]It's alright.
[312:47.78]I know.
[312:48.24]It's fine.
[312:48.86]Don't worry.
[312:50.78]It's all in good fun.
[312:51.62]It is.
[312:56.89]Doesn't bother me.
[312:57.43]It's okay.
[313:00.59]Hey, Flugboy.
[313:01.29]Thanks for the $1.
[313:01.99]Hey, Jerma.
[313:02.91]Eve's Flugboy here.
[313:04.51]Hope you're doing well.
[313:05.35]Finals are a thing this week and I'm feeling the pain.
[313:08.00]And I'm hoping my mental perk up after it... I'm hoping my mental perk up after it just wanted to let you know how much your streams make me happy.
[313:15.90]Thank you.
[313:17.86]Thank you, Eve's Flugboy.
[313:21.72]Good luck with your finals.
[313:22.49]It's a stressful time.
[313:24.83]Just take it easy.
[313:26.75]Do what you can.
[313:29.35]Try not to drive yourself crazy.
[313:31.75]Because... I don't... Let's talk about education, okay?
[313:36.04]Can we talk about the education system?
[313:38.18]Listen to this.
[313:38.96]Let's hear me out.
[313:39.46]Let's just... Isn't this interesting?
[313:42.80]Why do finals... Why do they do them just all?
[313:46.96]In the same fucking week?
[313:48.85]Why wouldn't you... Like, you can't spread that out so...
[313:53.73]Does it have to be, like, seven major tests in a row?
[313:58.57]That, like, determine, like, 25% of your whole grade?
[314:03.41]Why you can't have something happen?
[314:05.23]You gotta... There's no way to spread that out to make it easier for the students?
[314:12.61]Some... Do some schools do it?
[314:14.40]I don't know why.
[314:15.10]I don't understand.
[314:19.76]How would you make a schedule for that?
[314:21.00]I don't know, but, like, that...
[314:24.09]That's tough to do, to make students do 20% of their grade four days in a row on every single class.
[314:44.41]My final on Thursday is 65% of my grade, and what's up with that shit?
[314:48.89]What?
[314:51.47]No, that's not... Why?
[314:54.33]You know how many, okay, listen, you know how many people in the world don't test well?
[315:01.99]You're intelligent, you're retaining information, but you don't test well.
[315:06.61]That should, come on, there's got to be more indicators of somebody's knowledge retention than one single 50% of your grade test.
[315:25.70]People were not born to do tests.
[315:27.50]I know, what?
[315:28.46]Why?
[315:30.24]Give our students a little bit of slack!
[315:36.23]I was there.
[315:37.29]I remember that shit.
[315:49.78]And not all college teachers care to teach, no joke.
[315:52.10]I had a bad teacher who was an hour late every class.
[315:57.39]Is that for real?
[316:06.82]Yeah.
[316:07.22]I don't know.
[316:09.08]It just seems a little odd.
[316:11.40]To base your entire education around four days.
[316:16.40]It's like you did the lab work.
[316:20.39]You were there.
[316:20.79]You were in class every day.
[316:25.91]Gosh darn it.
[316:27.57]Give a little slack to our students.
[316:31.85]Anywho, thank you to, uh... Buttsquire for the one dollar.
[316:38.56]There's a game from a developer I've been following for ages by the name of Cosmo D called, uh... The Norwood Suite that I'd love to see you play on stream.
[316:50.10]Cosmo's in a band called Archipelago with his friends and uses the band's music as a soundtrack for his games.
[316:55.43]It's super soothing.
[316:56.21]I don't know how you feel about walking simulators, but you should definitely check it out.
[317:00.07]Here's a link to the trailer.
[317:02.21]I will.
[317:04.33]I will definitely watch the trailer and see if it's something that I'd be willing to play, for sure.
[317:13.12]No, you won't.
[317:13.82]What do you mean, no, I won't?
[317:17.46]No, you won't.
[317:19.87]I will watch this trailer.
[317:23.29]He won't.
[317:24.01]Oh my God, he'll get back to you on that.
[317:25.91]Come on, give me a little bit.
[317:28.05]Give the streamers some slack, okay?
[317:32.36]I just gave students slack, now I'll have the streamers slack.
[317:44.70]He already forgot.
[317:49.81]Uh, thank you, Buttsquire.
[317:51.27]Definitely will.
[317:52.31]I will definitely take a watch.
[317:55.25]I'll see if it's worth my streaming time, which it probably is.
[318:01.54]It seems it's worth my time.
[318:03.20]What, what, what, what, what, what does that mean?
[318:05.74]Well, it seems it's worth my time.
[318:10.83]He won't.
[318:11.49]Stop.
[318:11.93]It is worth it.
[318:12.69]I'm, it's gonna, it's probably a very good game.
[318:19.25]He never watches it, Etalyx told me.
[318:21.15]That's not true.
[318:25.29]Hey, MuMeansMu, thanks for the one dollar.
[318:26.73]I took your advice, grabbed a fish out of the local river and ate it raw and I still fail.
[318:30.77]Thanks a bunch.
[318:33.45]Hey, eating fish does not guarantee good grades.
[318:35.53]Eating fish prepares your mind for knowledge retention and memory pulling.
[318:43.04]Okay?
[318:44.00]It's not a guarantee.
[318:46.27]Now we don't do any reboots here.
[318:47.53]Um, right now, no.
[318:48.30]Unfortunately.
[318:48.68]There's just too much to do.
[318:49.52]There's so many things that are planned and so many things to play and do.
[318:53.02]Going back to Oblivion right now, I can't do it.
[319:15.97]Maybe if I need to... Okay, what am I gonna play today?
[319:20.03]I don't know.
[319:20.39]I mean, I did that today.
[319:22.24]But my brain functions on... I don't know.
[319:26.22]It might happen.
[319:27.32]It might happen... It might happen tomorrow.
[319:29.68]It might happen never.
[319:30.88]It might happen in a couple weeks.
[319:33.28]I just... I base every stream off of, like, what I want... What's happening today.
[319:36.99]Or the next day.
[319:37.71]I'm very scattered.
[319:45.27]Still won't stream Ultimate.
[319:48.46]I got scared to stream Ultimate.
[319:51.90]There were ResidentSleepers in the chat when I said I was gonna stream.
[319:55.28]I didn't even press the play button.
[319:57.74]And it was like, I don't know, ResidentSleeper.
[320:01.79]And I was like, already?
[320:05.81]That was just a joke.
[320:08.65]Well, there's no context with ResidentSleeper, it's just ResidentSleeper.
[320:14.80]Okay, there needs to be a Kappa sleeper.
[320:18.24]To, you know, like, oh, I'm just fucking around.
[320:19.94]You know, like, have Kappa be with his head tilted with a Z coming out of his eye or something.
[320:24.80]You know what I mean?
[320:25.26]Like, snoring.
[320:28.52]Because then I would know.
[320:29.52]Kappa sleeper.
[320:30.78]You just, oh, look, it's boring, but I'm just kidding.
[320:32.36]It's not.
[320:32.78]Go ahead.
[320:42.18]Kappa sleeper.
[320:45.82]I'll look into it.
[320:46.38]We'll see.
[320:48.38]Hey, Jinzybo.
[320:50.22]Thank you, Jinzybo, for the $10.
[320:52.15]Kind of hard to catch your streams here in Sweden.
[320:54.41]But here's for years of laughs and Chadwalks.
[320:56.99]Cheers.
[320:59.85]Thank you so much for the $10, and I do have to apologize to people in the EU.
[321:06.34]I'm really sorry.
[321:08.26]I moved even further back in the United States.
[321:11.90]So it's very difficult to try to please every time zone living in Pacific time.
[321:19.29]For me to do that, I would, but I mean, it still would be hard, because if I start streaming at, let's say, 11 or 12, 11 a.m.,
[321:26.31]a bunch of the North American audience now is, I'm doing it at work, I'm at school, I can't watch.
[321:32.90]It's very difficult to try to pinpoint, like, a perfect time.
[321:40.89]So I start my streams around 2 or 3 p.m.
[321:44.55]in the afternoon here, which is 6 o'clock Eastern, which is like 11 p.m.
[321:53.92]11, 10, 11, 12 p.m.
[321:55.82]I'm sorry.
[321:56.62]I wish I could stream at 8 in the morning and be able to have everybody watch, but it's just time zones.
[322:11.18]But I did, I have pulled back.
[322:13.70]We used to start consistently at 7 plus Eastern.
[322:19.31]And since moving to Vegas, I've tried to pull that back an hour or so.
[322:25.41]At least like an hour or two.
[322:28.21]And tonight we started at 7.
[322:30.49]We started at 7 yesterday, but we've been pretty consistent with starting at around 5 or 6 Eastern.
[322:41.79]Just eat fish.
[322:44.45]But thank you for the $10.
[322:47.66]And welcome from Sweden.
[322:49.10]Thank you.
[322:52.72]Emooch, thanks for the $2.
[322:54.20]PogChamp, hey Jerma, wish I could have been here for the whole stream, but it appears I missed it.
[322:58.09]It's okay though, much love, and when are you streaming again?
[323:00.13]Tomorrow.
[323:02.15]Gonna be playing EDF5 tomorrow with Star and Etalyx.
[323:06.12]Hey Darkstar, thanks for the one dollar, so let me get this straight.
[323:08.57]I should wake up, eat fish, or cheeseless macaroni.
[323:12.37]Figure out how the hell to say parmesan, take the final, eat a filet of fish for dinner, and then have horrible diarrhea.
[323:18.45]Thanks for the advice.
[323:30.85]Is that what came out of my mouth?
[323:33.67]Is that what you guys took from that?
[323:40.10]No, I said don't eat Filet-O-Fish.
[323:48.81]That was verbatim your advice.
[323:52.31]I don't believe that.
[323:54.47]I don't believe that.
[323:57.11]But thank you, Darkstar.
[323:59.61]Thank you, Mr. Pigeon, for the one dollar.
[324:02.49]Here's... Sausage, mushroom, and pepperoni... Sausage and mushroom pizza.
[324:09.69]I don't get it.
[324:39.65]What?
[324:42.07]This is what the person was in here screaming.
[324:44.63]That.
[324:45.85]Was that the guy that made the video?
[324:47.73]Was he in there saying that in this stream?
[324:59.02]That's the video.
[325:00.78]This has the most million views.
[325:05.15]Well, thank you for that, Mr. Pigeon.
[325:07.72]Uh, MooMeansMoo, thanks for $1.
[325:10.22]Guy Fieri more like Dyer Rieri.
[325:14.56]I ate at his restaurant and I can't stop shitting.
[325:27.14]That's the best joke of the night.
[325:29.50]Without even a doubt in my mind.
[325:32.70]Dyer Rieri.
[325:39.99]Uh, no, my joke is good.
[325:42.59]I know, but, like, come on.
[325:43.69]Diary every... You should put that on a bottom... Put that on a top text, bottom text.
[325:53.66]You just got on the front page of, like, every Reddit.
[326:04.20]Hey, Smarky, thanks for the $1.
[326:05.36]Hey, Jerma, I dislocated my knee recently.
[326:07.42]Pfft.
[326:08.87]Sorry to hear that.
[326:09.45]So I've been cooped up in my house.
[326:11.24]Thankfully, you've been here to keep me occupied in the meantime.
[326:14.04]Really sorry to hear that.
[326:15.68]That hurts.
[326:17.28]Hope you recover swiftly.
[326:19.88]Thanks for choosing this channel to hang out.
[326:22.16]Thank you.
[326:26.10]Maybe the top page of every Reddit in 2012.
[326:30.34]You'd be surprised.
[326:34.55]You'd be surprised.
[326:37.25]Hey, ExtraCheesy, thanks for the $1.
[326:38.55]Here's another dollar because I wanted to balance my mean calculator moment.
[326:41.90]Comment.
[326:43.32]With this nice one by saying you're my favorite internet dude and your funny hotline jump scare screams make me go hee hee ha ha.
[326:50.42]Also, I'll bump you up to a T183, you genius of a streamer.
[327:00.17]Make me go hee hee ha ha.
[327:02.93]Thank you, ExtraCheesy.
[327:04.85]Appreciate it.
[327:06.74]It's time for Slime, thanks for the $3.
[327:08.24]You should re-release all your old videos with an audio track of you giving embarrassed commentary.
[327:14.32]Reaction videos of my own videos, where I'm embarrassed of my previous- I'm embarrassed of my children or something.
[327:21.84]Like, what does that even- Like, ah, yeah, you know, my- My son was gonna be a doctor.
[327:33.13]Now he just screams swears on the internet.
[327:38.35]He was supposed to be a lawyer!
[327:39.71]No, that's my dad.
[327:42.53]Whoops.
[327:51.10]That's the boomer voice.
[327:52.16]Are you still drinking coffee?
[328:01.70]Fuck, I am.
[328:02.46]You're right.
[328:02.80]I need to stop doing that.
[328:03.70]I drank the whole thing this whole time.
[328:10.76]What does your son do?
[328:11.68]He's a streamer.
[328:12.28]What does he stream?
[328:13.16]Online con- no, online media.
[328:17.40]Now, we've watched a couple of the videos from before.
[328:23.85]From years ago.
[328:25.83]I love all of my video children, okay?
[328:30.81]There was a reason why I made them, each one of them.
[328:34.35]Except for the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 ones.
[328:38.73]I... those... I don't have those anymore.
[328:50.74]And maybe another 40 or 50 different videos that I may have removed because I didn't think they were good at all.
[328:58.51]Come on, I have... I had 8... I had like 975 children.
[329:00.41]I am essentially like a beehive, okay?
[329:09.06]I can't see and take care of all of my children.
[329:21.61]Make 10 more, have 10 more, bring them back.
[329:31.90]Let us click.
[329:33.34]No, I'm not gonna let you click.
[329:35.20]So you guys can put a penile shaped
[329:39.66]Apparatus on the screen?
[329:41.34]No.
[329:42.75]You lost privileges forever.
[329:48.77]But, thank you, it's time for slime for the three bucks.
[329:50.73]Thank you, Lazy Luke for the one dollar.
[329:52.05]What's your voice line when someone opens the Jerma game I'm making?
[329:57.30]Uh... Uh... Duh.
[330:04.16]That's pretty good, I think.
[330:05.00]I think that's good.
[330:08.21]Or if you want like a good one, how about like... Welcome to the game!
[330:13.61]No, that's really bad.
[330:15.39]How about... No?
[330:19.31]Um... Strap yourself in!
[330:26.38]Um... How about... I hope you enjoy playing.
[330:38.21]My game.
[330:40.22]But it's not my game because I didn't make it.
[330:43.26]Somebody else didn't.
[330:44.10]I bet it's going to be real fun.
[330:53.04]Oh, how about... I got one for you.
[331:01.41]You can do whatever you want with this.
[331:02.33]So, here you go.
[331:10.05]Softwave Studios presents.
[331:15.47]You fucked it up with the sub sound.
[331:22.08]Whatever, it's staying.
[331:28.08]Hey, thank you Shoe Shroom for the $1 rats.
[331:29.92]Rats were the rats.
[331:33.08]And Lazy Luke, thank you for the another dollar here.
[331:35.38]By the way, all your 2013 to 2014 YouTube videos are absolute perfection.
[331:39.70]Seriously.
[331:40.56]Thank you.
[331:43.24]I did have a lot of fun making YouTube videos.
[331:47.17]It was great.
[331:51.81]Mr. Dunwich thanks for the one dollar.
[331:53.25]They say I have bad news.
[331:55.79]What's the bad news?
[331:59.92]Okay.
[332:03.50]Thank you, Flaming Pizza, for the $1.
[332:05.26]How you doing today?
[332:06.74]Please know you're loved and appreciated.
[332:08.10]What's the matter?
[332:08.88]Thank you, Flaming Pizza.
[332:09.68]We had an art show, and I dropped one of the artist's pieces.
[332:13.34]Oh, that's too bad.
[332:14.78]It's also expensive.
[332:16.83]$2,000.
[332:17.45]Don't be upset.
[332:19.69]I'm sure the insurance will pay for it.
[332:21.53]The company didn't take out insurance this time.
[332:24.29]You're kidding.
[332:25.39]No.
[332:26.59]But my boss says he'll pay for it.
[332:29.03]See?
[332:29.99]Everything will be alright.
[332:31.69]But he'll probably never let me work at an art show again.
[332:35.77]Oh, don't think so negatively.
[332:39.02]I'm having trouble trying to figure out if these are actual people reading a script or if they are bots, just really well-trained bots.
[332:48.04]What's wrong?
[332:49.03]I can't tell.
[332:50.05]I really screwed up at the office.
[332:53.38]Oh, and I got fired.
[332:56.28]That's too bad, but it's not the end of the world.
[332:59.74]No?
[333:01.06]Actually, Barbara and I broke up.
[333:03.26]You are kidding.
[333:05.65]And it is the end of the world.
[333:08.07]Oh, don't think so negatively.
[333:09.33]What?
[333:12.07]Hold on, that went back and forth very, very quickly.
[333:17.98]Actually, Barbara and I broke up.
[333:20.66]You are kidding.
[333:23.22]Actually, Barbara and I broke up.
[333:28.61]You are kidding.
[333:31.09]And it is the end of the world.
[333:37.17]Oh, don't think so negatively.
[333:43.94]I'll never get sick of that.
[333:49.42]Thank you, Mr. Dunwich.
[333:51.86]Flaming Pizza, they said, how are you?
[333:53.42]I'm doing well.
[333:53.94]Hope you're doing well as well.
[333:55.68]That was a lot of times.
[333:56.36]I said well like seven times.
[333:58.34]Hey, Buttsquire, thanks for the $1.
[333:59.64]We should all watch Norwood's sweet trailer together.
[334:01.60]Think of it as a bonding experience with chat.
[334:03.81]Say, do you like pie?
[334:08.75]Queue it up.
[334:10.09]It's Danny.
[334:10.77]Thank you.
[334:11.03]It's Danny for the $1.
[334:11.57]Hey, Jerma, will you ever consider playing Hotline Miami 2?
[334:13.71]If so, when?
[334:14.39]By the way, great stream.
[334:15.27]Yes, playing Hotline Miami 2 next week.
[334:18.78]Gonna try to do it all in one stream, but we probably won't.
[334:22.22]I might have to break that up into two streams so I don't lose my absolute mind.
[334:26.63]Because I could see myself getting exhausted and getting very, very sledgehammer-y.
[334:31.47]You know what I mean?
[334:33.17]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[334:34.93]But thank you, Danny.
[334:36.76]Uh, Toby...
[334:38.54]Laron, Ed.
[334:41.36]Thank you for the one dollar.
[334:42.24]What a terrible fucking pronunciation that just gave.
[334:45.06]Hey Jeremy, do you have any advice after a bad breakup?
[334:47.66]Not my first time, but it always feels pretty bad after it happens.
[334:50.44]Also, love you streams really helps every time when things are rough.
[334:54.66]Um... Honestly, here's the best thing that I could say.
[335:00.45]If you're having romantic trouble.
[335:02.89]And, you know, it's a breakup or, you know, whatever, right?
[335:07.51]Eventually, it's... Eventually, it's not gonna be as bad.
[335:13.35]Eventually, you'll move on.
[335:15.27]It's just right now, right now, it sucks.
[335:18.85]And right now, you're thinking, this is fucking the worst.
[335:21.07]This is the worst thing ever.
[335:23.45]How am I ever gonna recover from this?
[335:27.83]In a month or two, after like a couple of months, you'll just start to... You'll start to move away from it.
[335:38.45]It takes time.
[335:41.05]And it's the worst because right now, everything fucking sucks.
[335:44.18]Right now.
[335:45.94]But if you can reach into the future to future you, you'll be able to see that that future you will look back and be like, hey man, everything's fine.
[335:53.78]Everything's fine.
[335:58.41]It might take a little while.
[336:01.65]But the last time I had like a real, oh no, like,
[336:07.72]Romantic problem or breakup or anything it was I?
[336:11.50]Wish like future me could have just looked back and been like hey dude everything is everything is just fucking fine Just need to give it some time and let yourself grow you know let yourself let yourself grow and
[336:33.15]You keep yourself in a box and you keep thinking about this one thing that happened.
[336:37.18]You... No.
[336:40.48]You'll look back and be like, alright, I'm good.
[336:47.72]Let yourself grow more than 5'8".
[336:49.11]That person's banned for life.
[336:54.99]But... Take care of yourself, Toby.
[336:58.31]Thank you for the $1.
[337:00.67]And hopefully you feel better.
[337:07.70]Take some- take some me days, by the way.
[337:15.10]Those are very important.
[337:20.17]Hey, thank you!
[337:20.73]Moo means moo for the one dollar!
[337:22.05]And here it is!
[337:25.05]Alright, it's the Guy Fieri.
[337:28.80]More like Diary Harry.
[337:32.16]Alright, now get that-
[337:39.78]I'm telling you.
[337:40.36]I'm telling you, that's like a 4,000 upvote image.
[337:46.35]It just is.
[337:48.19]If I was scrolling through a subreddit and I saw that image, and I looked over to the right and I saw how many upvotes it had, I'd be like, I understand, it makes sense to me.
[338:00.22]I'm putting that on a t-shirt.
[338:01.58]Well, I hope you wear it in public.
[338:05.22]Thank you.
[338:05.56]Thank you Cool42 for the one dollar.
[338:07.40]I've been trying to farm bits for the past month since the Labo car stream, but then I found something that I needed to show you this stream.
[338:15.27]So here it is.
[338:16.43]I'm two more bits away from another hundred, so I'll give those next stream.
[338:21.25]Well, thank you.
[338:22.61]Thank you for bit farming.
[338:24.98]For months.
[338:28.86]And what you wanted to show me was... Why are we watching all these fucking old videos?
[338:53.55]Hey, by the way, they like deleted my entire Modern Warfare Grandpa series.
[338:59.65]It doesn't exist anymore.
[339:00.85]I made like 15 to 20 videos, and they're gone.
[339:09.06]These used to be on Machinima Respawn, and they like took them off.
[339:12.38]I haven't been able to find them.
[339:21.93]hello everybody welcome to modern warfare 3 if you're as excited for this game as I was being one of the top 10 players in the world that's right this is Germany's grandfather here annotation on the whole screen he can't give you the tips he can't give you the strategies that I can so let me just tell you that I'm one of the best players in the world and I'll show you right here look I just get the fuck out of here buddy
[339:48.24]Let me tell you, I have so much confidence in my game, if I die one time in this fucking gameplay, then I'm going to pay everybody $6,000.
[339:59.03]You understand me?
[340:00.41]That's how good I am.
[340:01.35]I usually put up 400... Fuck.
[340:05.65]Jeremy!
[340:08.01]Jeremy, come down here!
[340:09.91]What?
[340:11.75]Hey, how do I restart recordings?
[340:14.86]I can't hear you.
[340:15.62]What?
[340:15.82]No, I...
[340:17.83]How do I restart a recording?
[340:19.48]What are you doing?
[340:20.20]You're recording?
[340:21.42]Well, I just fucking told everybody I was going to give him $6,000!
[340:24.02]I don't have that kind of fucking money!
[340:27.10]Gee, it's F9!
[340:27.98]It's F9?
[340:28.98]Yeah.
[340:29.90]Okay, well, I just... Hey, everybody, it's Jeremy's grandfather here, bringing you a first-ever modern Warfare 3 gameplay on his channel, and I'm going to tell you all the tips and all the strategies on how to be the best player in planet Earth.
[340:46.19]And I'm pretty good at this game.
[340:47.87]I'm not that good, but I've been, you know, people have told me that I'm pretty good.
[340:53.06]So this gun is the SCAR-L and the attachments on it.
[340:56.74]And you're gonna be the red dot sight.
[340:59.17]And it's gonna have less recoil.
[341:02.67]I can't believe I... I'm actually saying this though.
[341:07.00]And I don't remember the third one.
[341:10.16]So I found that if you want to be lighter, you want to throw all your grenades out within the first two seconds of the game and every time you respawn because you don't want to carry that extra fucking weight.
[341:21.96]You know, that's just extra weight.
[341:23.58]And if you happen to hit somebody on your team with a flashbang,
[341:27.45]Another tip I want to give you is always unload your entire clip whenever you shoot the gun.
[341:35.23]Because it just scares people away.
[341:37.27]They see the spray and they get scared of you.
[341:39.66]And that's how you show real dominance.
[341:41.82]You say, here's my gun and here's me unloading the fucking whole clip on you.
[341:46.38]Hold on.
[341:46.78]I have to diarrhea.
[341:48.32]Oh, there it is.
[341:49.40]There it is.
[341:50.02]There's the diarrhea.
[341:51.68]Yeah, I got another tip for you.
[341:53.16]This one is for Communicating before the game you always want to make sure people understand what your plan is Because you have to make sure they know what you're talking about.
[342:02.75]So make sure here's an example Wow
[342:12.98]Shut up, alright?
[342:13.96]Jesus, fuck!
[342:15.57]Here's a scoreboard from the game, and as you can tell, I got 13 kills, and 15 people in the game said I was a cool guy, and they got rid of deaths.
[342:27.45]There's no more deaths.
[342:28.43]I did not doctor this photo.
[342:30.87]So it looks like this for everybody, and if it doesn't look like this, then you have a computer bug.
[342:37.33]So I'll talk to you guys later.
[342:39.61]See you.
[342:40.07]Have fun in the game, you fuckers.
[342:48.25]That's a long time ago.
[342:53.17]That is... You wanna know how long ago that was?
[342:55.78]That was November 9th, 2011.
[343:05.46]That was more than seven years ago.
[343:13.77]That's ancient by internet standards.
[343:22.27]I wasn't even alive seven years ago.
[343:27.64]Some of those I really thought were really, really fun.
[343:29.78]They were really fun to make.
[343:31.92]There's one where I was editing a video.
[343:34.94]Those of you that don't understand.
[343:38.36]This, like, I did a series on Machinima.
[343:41.42]Where, because Call of Duty and, like, montages and people spinning around in headshot and throwing tomahawks across.
[343:48.15]It was, like, the biggest videos on YouTube.
[343:50.87]You wanna talk about like large YouTube stars?
[343:53.11]If you had like a Call of Duty montage on your channel, that was the biggest thing on the whole website.
[343:59.51]So that's what these videos came from.
[344:06.28]And there was one in particular where I was making my own montage as Grandpa.
[344:11.22]And I pulled back, there was a huge premiere timeline.
[344:16.08]And I think that video's gone forever.
[344:25.90]But, yeah, that's some history there.
[344:29.81]I made a lot of those videos.
[344:31.47]I made at least 15 of them.
[344:33.75]And they all got, like, privated or removed.
[344:35.65]I don't know what the hell they were doing.
[344:38.19]Who knows?
[344:40.25]But, we're at the end of the bits here.
[344:43.65]Thank you, Cool42, for the link to that video.
[344:46.84]That's the only one I think that's still on my channel.
[344:48.48]There might be one more floating around somewhere.
[344:50.79]CriticalCorn, thanks for the $1.
[344:51.97]Hey, Jerma, it's one of the... It's one of the Georgia guys from PAX.
[344:56.35]Did you ever find a way to crack open that pecan and enjoy some of them?
[345:01.15]Still loving the stuff and we both still love everything you make.
[345:04.15]And so it's untypical of content creators to keep making great content like you do.
[345:08.89]Keep up the great work.
[345:09.89]Love you.
[345:10.77]No, I never figured out how to open them.
[345:13.57]I had no idea.
[345:18.02]Just like nuts.
[345:19.56]They brought like food.
[345:23.68]They drove.
[345:30.14]Are you ever going to make more videos on the main channel?
[345:33.64]I don't know.
[345:35.88]I kind of got really jaded after a couple of things that I don't really even need to talk about on stream.
[345:44.03]But kind of like the fall of YouTube in a sense.
[345:48.93]And how Twitch was a more... It seemed like a more inviting platform at the time.
[345:58.07]But there's a whole lot of other reasons that there's so many.
[346:02.59]I could go, we could sit here for a couple hours and talk about why I've essentially moved completely away from making YouTube videos.
[346:13.26]And we could be here all day.
[346:16.68]But, okay, let's do it.
[346:18.15]No, no, no.
[346:21.80]But there was a chance there at some point a couple of years ago where I wanted to start to do productions and videos and move sort of split the channel in two different directions, right?
[346:36.87]Have gaming stuff and gameplay stuff and gaming videos, but then also do other like big kind of passion projects that I've really always wanted to make for a long time.
[346:47.38]And it became very difficult to even attempt that.
[346:52.95]Because I've told you guys this a million times, that I need to keep myself interested.
[346:59.65]And remember, I've been doing this for seven, almost eight years.
[347:04.45]Straight.
[347:05.55]I've never stopped, you know?
[347:07.83]There's never been a time, the only, honestly, this last October was the only time that I was really away from making a stream or a video in probably eight years.
[347:21.48]I've never gone more than a month or three weeks or four weeks without kind of doing something.
[347:39.30]But I want to make sure that I stay interested because I can't do anything unless I'm interested in what I'm going to do.
[347:47.30]I can't put on a face.
[347:49.13]I can't pretend.
[347:51.09]Some people can.
[347:53.19]I can't.
[347:59.13]I want to make sure that what I'm doing is fun.
[348:03.40]Well, the stream just kind of ate shit there for a second.
[348:07.86]But I want to make sure the thing that I'm doing is I'm having fun.
[348:12.99]You didn't stream for almost a month when you moved.
[348:15.53]Oh, yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[348:16.47]Like, besides this last October, which is what I meant by that, from this move, before moving to Vegas, I was, you know, I've been doing it for eight years straight.
[348:29.80]I've taken some, you know, small breaks here and there, like a week or two, okay, whatever.
[348:33.28]But never much longer than that.
[348:41.10]The music is pitch shifting in the background.
[348:43.21]What?
[348:45.99]Is it really?
[348:48.03]That's weird.
[348:52.39]It's probably because the internet is like kind of... coughing right now.
[348:57.50]We're in a little rough patch.
[349:03.54]But yeah, I don't... Oh, YouTube, bye.
[349:07.30]See you later.
[349:07.66]I'm never going to make content again on YouTube.
[349:10.05]I don't know.
[349:12.26]I'm just going with what my gut tells me to do.
[349:18.14]And it was, I feel like doing streaming, because that interests me, and I'm really, really interested in that.
[349:27.65]I hope you guys stick around for the ride, because I'm going to keep going.
[349:36.62]End of content creation voice.
[349:42.53]New vlog.
[349:44.19]No.
[349:46.53]I don't know what's gonna happen next.
[349:48.41]I mean, it's Twitch.
[349:50.45]Once I'm on Twitch for as long as I've been on YouTube, things will probably start to get interesting for me.
[349:56.30]Because then I have to figure out, okay, so is this it?
[349:59.62]I was on YouTube for five years.
[350:02.74]This is year three of Twitch.
[350:05.68]Having, you know, streaming more than three times a week.
[350:10.15]So I don't know.
[350:10.65]In another couple of years, I'm going to have to kind of reevaluate where I am and what I'm doing and what's next.
[350:18.36]I don't know.
[350:25.05]I cannot give you the answer to that because I don't know what it is.
[350:28.75]But I'm going to go as long as I can.
[350:37.72]Facebook Live?
[350:38.64]I don't think so.
[350:39.46]No.
[350:42.11]But Buttsquire, thanks for the $1.
[350:43.53]How much of my very, very little money do I have to throw at you before you actually watch the trailer?
[350:48.80]Please, my crops are dying.
[350:49.96]We're going to watch it, don't worry.
[350:52.12]And then Killer Crocomire, thanks for the $5.
[350:55.12]And they said, is this true?
[351:02.57]Let's see.
[351:03.79]It's Mr. Slynde.
[351:05.24]Mr. Slim, Jerma claims that you and him are the same height.
[351:08.22]Is that true?
[351:08.96]Thank God he's gonna finally put this to bed.
[351:10.58]No, not even close, dude.
[351:12.78]What?
[351:13.60]Wait, what is he doing?
[351:15.54]Jerma is very short.
[351:17.20]Why is he doing this to me?
[351:18.60]Why are you doing this to me?
[351:20.74]What?
[351:21.62]Wait, I thought he was gonna come to bat for me.
[351:24.80]This is a big joke.
[351:26.00]This is a huge joke.
[351:27.95]He's pulling a big joke on me right now.
[351:33.11]No, listen to how he says this you hold on process this information They hear that now that that's like I'm joking around kind of I'm lying here He's just he's just being funny Take a look at that fucking image.
[351:56.05]I I really thought he was gonna be like, yeah, I
[352:02.28]Betrayed!
[352:03.52]Betrayed!
[352:04.26]Are the same height, is that true?
[352:30.19]No, not even close.
[352:31.57]Did you listen to the ha-ha there?
[352:32.81]He's made, this is a funny little reference.
[352:34.31]He's playing along.
[352:36.03]He's doing a really great job playing along, and that's fine, and it's funny.
[352:39.61]One of these days, I'm gonna prove this once and for all.
[352:50.80]And we'll see, we'll see who's laughing when I stand it up straight.
[352:59.76]I'm just standing there and it's like, oh, look at that.
[353:02.78]Look at him.
[353:03.96]Look at him.
[353:10.05]Measure the height on stream.
[353:11.97]No, I'm not going to do that.
[353:21.08]I could do that, but like, I don't, but that's so...
[353:27.56]Why not?
[353:28.50]Alright, I'll do it.
[353:29.70]I'm gonna measure my height on stream.
[353:31.78]Maybe not tomorrow, but maybe at some point in the next... I got betrayed!
[353:37.96]I've been betrayed!
[353:39.94]This is like when the... I just got backstabbed by one of my most loyal friends!
[353:46.15]I'm like the king on the throne!
[353:50.08]And like the second, like the second in command is like, yes, King, whatever you say.
[353:55.01]And I'm like, yes, absolutely.
[353:56.81]Send them all.
[353:58.17]And like I get stabbed in the back and I look back and I'm like, oh, you too?
[354:01.96]You too?
[354:19.13]Uh, he's a really, really nice guy, and he's funny, and he's making a funny joke.
[354:23.49]I appreciate the joke, and it's a very funny one, but he's a really great guy.
[354:26.85]Just know that Mr. Shalyn is a great guy.
[354:28.73]He really is.
[354:32.07]Uh, thank you MooMeetsMoo for the $1.
[354:33.83]Huge joke played on TinyStreamer.
[354:35.53]Hehehe, ha ha ha, he he.
[354:37.33]All jokes aside, hope things are well for everyone.
[354:39.53]Looking forward to watching the VOD.
[354:40.81]Yeah, hope everyone's doing well too.
[354:44.15]So let's watch, uh, let's watch the trailer for this game and see if I'm gonna be into it.
[354:49.12]Maybe I will.
[354:50.62]Maybe I won't.
[354:52.12]Maybe I will.
[354:56.48]Let's see.
[354:57.66]It is right here.
[354:59.86]Here's the trailer for Buttsquire.
[355:03.62]No, that's not the name of this.
[355:05.28]The name of this is the Norwood Suite.
[355:15.64]Here it comes.
[355:19.47]Alliance digital media Okay I like the characters Produced by online media
[355:52.84]You make sandwiches?
[355:55.08]Alright.
[355:57.60]You get to make sandwiches, that sounds fun.
[356:02.56]Vinny played this?
[356:03.58]Did he like it?
[356:15.09]He loves it, huh?
[356:16.65]That's a pretty good recommendation, then.
[356:28.69]The Norwood Suite.
[356:31.07]Okay.
[356:34.92]Seems like fun.
[356:37.14]Looks neat and surreal.
[356:41.34]Yeah, it looks pretty cool, actually.
[356:44.96]Alright, and finally... Dr. Steen, thanks for the $1.
[356:49.04]Doctor's appointment check upstream.
[356:50.23]Will you get your height, weight, hearing, and sight checked?
[356:54.29]Kind of funny, actually.
[356:55.73]But without further ado, we're going to end the stream here with... Let's see.
[356:58.92]Let me make sure this is correct.
[357:02.84]A rat movie.
[357:04.74]Rat movie has passed a million views on YouTube.
[357:08.46]So... Why not?
[357:11.74]The credits are going to roll while this plays in the background.
[357:22.08]Rat movie.
[357:24.24]The original one.
[357:28.16]Wait, didn't we just watch this, like... Like, not even a month ago?
[357:34.98]We actually watched this, like, a month ago.
[357:42.53]Doesn't matter.
[357:43.17]Oh, well, alright, here.
[357:46.71]I just fucking mashed my hands on my keyboard.
[357:58.10]Please, correct it for me.
[357:59.82]Get a YouTube... Alright, here we go.
[358:03.49]Here come the subs.
[358:04.55]Thank you, everybody.
[358:06.07]That's the end of the movie.
[358:26.31]So sue me for being thorough.
[358:28.06]I want to know that you know what the plan is.
[358:30.30]Look, seriously.
[358:32.52]How many artifacts do we need to steal?
[358:34.16]I remember it looks like this.
[358:35.96]Well, I just want to make sure you know what's happening.
[358:38.14]We're going to get the treasure.
[358:39.40]We're going to get out of there.
[358:40.88]And we also have to sell it.
[358:42.26]And we must get it.
[358:45.10]This is like a gigantic Patreon list.
[358:48.32]This video was made possible by all these people, which is probably, that's arguably true.
[358:53.08]Let's go, speed it up.
[358:53.58]Yeah, that's the speed I'm looking for.
[358:56.29]That's the type of fastness I want.
[359:12.63]I need to pick another one of these.
[359:14.05]It just takes so long to make them.
[359:15.13]The program is so old.
[359:16.41]It's actually $10 to dance in this building.
[359:19.09]You're gonna have to get...
[359:40.93]Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, may I have the attention of the class?
[359:44.93]My name is Dick Dastardly Richard, and I'm here to take the treasure chest... Just runs like shit.
[359:50.66]Go get it, boys.
[359:51.66]Make it a community event.
[359:53.48]And let me tell you something, clerk.
[359:55.37]If you so as move a muscle,
[359:57.83]How would that work, though?
[359:59.79]I mean, I guess it could- okay.
[360:04.29]No, but that would be so hard, because I would say, oh yeah, we'll just designate scenes to different people, but how do you designate that?
[360:11.07]Live-action remake.
[360:28.64]That's actually kind of a funny idea.
[360:30.52]Very low sodium.
[360:57.82]Oh, that's Star.
[360:58.98]I know that guy.
[361:01.10]Frozen is that old?
[361:02.02]Yeah, it is.
[361:02.31]This video is like five years old.
[361:28.78]It's the worst guy in the whole video.
[361:30.12]I hate this voice, and I hate this guy.
[361:56.49]No, no, why would that happen?
[361:57.89]That's not us.
[361:59.55]We're just people.
[362:00.47]Man, I'm going to be taking you in.
[362:02.05]Wouldn't it be funny if this were real?
[362:04.65]I'm just kidding.
[362:05.99]Be careful, though.
[362:06.69]There's apparently a giant rat around.
[362:08.97]You have a good day, Ops.
[362:10.45]Wouldn't it be funny?
[362:11.31]Yeah, I don't know what I was doing there.
[362:13.59]So, you figure anything out in there?
[362:15.07]I don't know what that was.
[362:17.29]It's back to the drawing board.
[362:19.35]Well, that's great.
[362:20.27]I don't know how to draw, so you're going to have to do the drawing.
[362:27.67]God damn it.
[362:30.04]I'm so glad they didn't return.
[362:31.40]Oh yeah, they did.
[362:33.44]They came back in the second one.
[362:34.80]What the fuck?
[362:56.31]Boss, we got big problems.
[362:57.61]The cat police are here.
[362:58.81]Are you kidding me right now, cat police?
[363:00.53]Get us the fuck out of here.
[363:02.53]Drive the car.
[363:03.47]Get us out.
[363:04.26]Let's speed it up.
[363:05.22]We're getting the fuck out of here.
[363:07.36]Come on, gentlemen.
[363:09.74]Cat police.
[363:14.24]Good job, cat police.
[363:16.40]You did it again.
[363:17.14]You saved the world.
[363:18.70]And that's what we do as cat police.
[363:21.10]We make the world a better place.
[363:24.92]No, there it is.
[363:25.58]There's the explosion of the Earth.
[363:27.26]Oh, yeah.
[363:28.52]I remember that from the green screen movie night.
[363:35.24]There it is.
[363:35.70]Million views.
[363:39.85]What the fuck is happening?
[363:42.35]Why am I playing?
[363:42.71]There's another video playing.
[363:47.67]What video is playing?
[363:51.99]Oh, 700,000.
[363:53.55]No, it's not playing.
[363:54.39]Never mind.
[363:58.69]They keep playing.
[363:59.97]How do I get rid of this?
[364:10.03]Oh, there it is.
[364:10.69]Okay.
[364:13.23]Alright.
[364:13.71]I'm going to get out of here.
[364:15.40]Thanks for all the subs.
[364:16.18]Thanks for all the resubs.
[364:16.86]Thanks for all the bits.
[364:19.22]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[364:21.40]Probably around between like 2.30 and 3.30 Pacific.
[364:27.63]I didn't have autoplay on.
[364:28.61]I had the browser plugin still running on OBS.
[364:33.27]But thanks for watching.
[364:34.25]Hope you enjoyed Hotline Miami.
[364:35.56]That was actually very, very fun.
[364:37.18]I had a really good time.
[364:39.80]We'll play the second one next week.
[364:42.16]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[364:43.32]Have a great rest of your night.
[364:44.44]Take care.
[364:45.32]Everybody.
[365:13.34]you
