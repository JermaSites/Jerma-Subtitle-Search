[ve:61.1.100]

[00:29.38]Well, how are you doing?
[00:31.04]How's it going?
[00:36.53]Welcome to another stream.
[00:37.95]How are you?
[00:38.73]Cool.
[00:39.93]Good to know.
[00:40.55]How are the kids?
[00:44.88]Now, we talked about this a couple days ago.
[00:48.02]And I have some data now.
[00:50.74]The majority of this stream, apparently, is over the age of 30.
[00:55.76]The biggest demographic of this stream, I think, is 24 to 30.
[00:59.57]24 to 35.
[01:00.47]I was able to see that on my dashboard.
[01:05.61]That's interesting.
[01:13.11]Alright.
[01:20.33]24 to 35 is not everybody's over 30.
[01:25.97]Yeah, but I mean, I can see the data.
[01:27.57]Uh, what's up?
[01:32.15]How you doing?
[01:33.69]Uh, we got some stuff going on.
[01:35.75]It's daylight savings time today?
[01:37.27]When is it?
[01:37.67]Wait, when is it?
[01:40.27]Wait, wait, when is it?
[01:41.17]Wait.
[01:42.37]Did it happen?
[01:42.93]Am I an hour late?
[01:47.07]No, no, no.
[01:47.61]Okay, I thought I was an hour late.
[01:50.64]It's this morning.
[01:51.22]Okay.
[01:52.20]Night.
[01:52.36]I was going to say, hopefully I'm not accidentally an hour late.
[02:00.06]But yeah, today we are going to be doing scary games.
[02:07.21]I made a promise.
[02:09.47]I told you guys that I was going to be playing horror games at some point.
[02:12.41]I was going to do an Ichio Horror Night with a facecam.
[02:18.04]And I intended to keep my promise there.
[02:20.54]That's exactly what we're going to do.
[02:21.82]I don't know if we're going to get through all of these tonight.
[02:30.44]I'm just going to go until I'm kind of done.
[02:34.83]There's 10 games, I think.
[02:37.69]All ranging between a 10 minute experience to a 45 minute experience.
[02:53.66]The facecam being such a treat is so creepy.
[02:59.35]I don't really use it anymore.
[03:00.41]I have it as an implied facecam in the corner.
[03:05.87]I just don't give a shit about it.
[03:07.07]I really don't anymore.
[03:07.91]I'm just like, it's cool.
[03:09.25]I like it sometimes, but I'd rather be able to, you know, pick and eat my own boogers without you guys knowing about it.
[03:14.48]I don't care.
[03:14.90]Oh my God, did you hear what he said?
[03:17.88]What the fuck?
[03:18.62]Oh my God.
[03:19.72]Somebody capped that.
[03:20.44]Screen capped that.
[03:23.40]Dude, I screencapped it, but there's no audio.
[03:25.62]There's no audio on it.
[03:26.84]How do we prove that he said that?
[03:27.84]Oh, no, I got it, dude.
[03:28.70]I was recording.
[03:29.20]We're going to get some ads playing during the starting soon.
[03:37.73]Hopefully they start when they're supposed to this time.
[03:40.27]If not, then we will just talk until they do.
[03:44.63]So I'll prepare for a few minutes of ads, knock out the pre-rolls.
[03:47.71]We'll be back.
[03:49.91]But again, in the event that they don't start, I will stay here until they do, and they will just cut me off.
[04:02.68]Take a photo of that.
[04:03.84]Yeah.
[04:06.26]I'm doing good.
[04:06.67]I'm doing good.
[04:07.19]I've got tea.
[04:09.49]Ads may play right now.
[04:10.85]Just to give you a warning.
[04:12.89]If they don't, then they will very, very soon.
[04:17.17]And if they do that... Oh, there they are.
[04:18.49]Perfect.
[04:19.91]Actually worked this time.
[04:21.29]Alright.
[04:21.57]I'll be right back.
[04:22.47]See you in a few minutes.
[06:53.93]I'm back.
[06:55.95]I think there's still about 20 seconds left in this original ad break.
[07:05.78]And then we're good for an hour.
[07:08.98]And I'm ready.
[07:09.34]See if I can time it.
[07:16.24]okay welcome back everybody thanks for hanging out here we're going to be playing some scary games today uh the first one I have here I just went to itch.io and just sorted kind of by popular I got some recommendations uh this one first one's going to be a car game and it's a demo uh it's called am demo apparently you drive around a car you may have heard of it I don't know

[08:03.36]I wanted to be kind of scary.
[08:05.19]And you're only going to see the shine of my forehead today, apparently.
[08:09.49]But that's alright.
[08:12.03]We do what we're going to do.
[08:15.47]Yeah, okay, I proved that I'm alive.
[08:17.11]I exist.
[08:18.43]There you go.
[08:19.79]All the doubters.
[08:22.56]That's what you look like?
[08:26.10]There's like 10,000 clips of my face zoomed in on the internet.

[08:33.98]Anyways, okay, this is AM.
[08:35.36]I've got it ready.

[08:36.96]And this one has music.

[08:38.83]I turned it down, but I'm ready.
[08:40.63]Well, hey, I told you we're going to get scared tonight.
[08:45.17]That's why I've got my ginger tea to make sure I quell the stomach upset that's going to happen when I eventually get scared.
[08:51.22]You have a mullet?
[08:53.00]I told you I'm growing my hair until I'm 40.
[08:56.32]This hair is going to go until my 40th birthday.

[09:40.91]I can't hear shit.
[09:41.53]Alright, here we go.
[09:47.99]Uh, I want an experience that is tense but fair.
[09:50.49]I prefer atmosphere over anything.
[09:51.97]Let's do tense.
[09:53.49]Tense but fair.
[09:55.92]Hard.
[09:56.24]Fairness is lame.
[09:57.64]I want a chance.
[09:58.46]No.
[09:58.86]Nobody does.
[09:59.26]I don't do that.
[10:00.14]I do.
[10:00.50]I'm normal.
[10:00.98]Okay.
[10:04.02]Okay.
[10:06.25]Another horror game demo.
[10:10.88]Playtime 40 minutes.
[10:12.22]Alright, what's the goal?
[10:13.36]What do I do?
[10:15.94]I should have time for two more games after this.
[10:18.00]This is actually what I just said.
[10:19.12]Okay.
[10:27.69]Okay.
[10:33.74]Alright, WASD, wait, what is F?
[10:36.54]Oh, flashlight?
[10:38.53]Brake, okay, handbrake.
[10:39.53]Alright, brake is space.
[10:42.03]Flashlight is F. And then respawn is tab.
[10:44.13]Alright, pretty self-explanatory.
[10:48.39]Click on the sides of the screen to rotate the camera and change the views.
[10:52.94]So I click on the screen to look around.
[10:54.46]Alright.
[10:57.28]Explore the car thoroughly and identify what can be interacted with.
[11:01.16]Turn the radio on, I guess.
[11:09.46]I gotta turn this up.
[11:15.66]What should I do?
[11:17.19]Radio station?
[11:18.45]Okay.
[11:19.29]Oh, that's windshield wipers.
[11:21.41]Alright.
[11:21.83]I don't need those.
[11:24.25]What's that?
[11:24.53]Lights?
[11:24.77]Oops, don't do that.
[11:26.59]How do I use the car?
[11:37.75]Is someone just gonna fucking jump out and scream at me?
[11:39.85]Do you drive the car in this game or are you just inside of a car?
[11:42.43]Oh, okay.
[11:54.13]What's the goal of the game?
[11:55.01]Do you just drive down the road?
[11:56.37]Do I have to worry about gas?
[11:58.75]Alright, the car is weird.
[11:59.62]Watch your speed when taking corners.
[12:01.12]Slow down if you want to maintain control.
[12:15.08]End of the world?
[12:31.68]Alright, I'm fine.
[12:32.60]I'm fine.
[12:33.06]I'm fine.
[12:33.38]I just like kind of... The car is fucked up already.
[12:35.66]I'm so glad it didn't play on hard.
[12:54.80]you see only god knows when the rapture will happen no matter how convincing some of these predictions might sound just remember that's a tight corner from people not the almighty
[13:07.59]Wrong side of the road?
[13:08.49]There's no other cars on the road.
[13:10.29]I'm fine.
[13:10.95]What?
[13:11.23]What?
[13:11.45]What?
[13:11.89]What?
[13:12.25]Is there a pig?
[13:13.27]Did I just run over a pig?
[13:14.05]What did I run over?
[13:35.66]In fact, if we were keeping score, we should be on Jesus' sixth or seventh coming by now, and that's in my lifetime alone.
[13:44.03]So let's just say history hasn't been too kind to those dime store prophets.
[13:49.62]But here's what I really want to get across.
[13:51.70]And I don't see anything close for this one.
[13:54.87]There was a face is not something to fear.
[13:57.83]No, it's the fulfillment of God's promise.
[14:00.25]I don't know what that was for eternity.
[14:02.79]Now, some of you might be.
[14:04.27]Maybe I should drive slow.
[14:05.30]Todd, you can say that, but I don't feel ready.
[14:08.70]It's too soon.
[14:10.02]Well, let me remind you of this.
[14:12.57]Wait.
[14:13.03]What?
[14:13.51]What?
[14:13.79]Poke is like... Poke just like knocked on my stream door.
[14:18.02]What was that?
[14:18.40]What was that?
[14:19.10]It said Poke wants to like not come in your house or something.
[14:22.64]What was that?
[14:31.42]So don't let fear or uncertainty rob you of your peace.
[14:35.05]Car.
[14:36.11]Keep your eyes on the Lord, trust his promise, and rest easy in the knowledge that time is always right.
[14:43.03]Oh, dudes.
[14:43.27]Dudes, what the fuck is this?
[14:45.13]Look, somebody got fired.
[14:46.39]Somebody got killed here.
[14:50.54]What?
[14:51.48]Did I get out of the car?
[14:54.48]No, no, no, no, no, roll the window.
[14:55.58]What are you doing?
[14:56.40]Oh my god, that's the scariest thing ever.
[14:57.46]Just wrapping the window up.
[14:59.34]I'm freaking out.
[14:59.82]Move, move.
[15:00.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:00.84]What do I do?
[15:02.16]Just leave?
[15:03.58]Are there items?
[15:04.08]I don't know.
[15:10.74]Uh.
[15:14.00]What the hell is that?
[15:21.81]Dead end.
[15:33.52]Hey, neighbor, how are you?
[15:35.82]Having a little bit of car trouble.
[15:37.66]I got some jumpers in the backseat.
[15:39.04]I'll take care of you.
[15:41.34]You got a triple A?
[15:48.87]Wait, wait, wait.
[15:49.75]Does it just turn around?
[15:58.87]Wait, I'm on like a different road.
[16:01.18]This is like an off road.
[16:05.69]I swear, if the fucking Bigfoot comes up from these trees, I'm running him over.
[16:24.65]But not before I get at least three pictures of him alive.
[16:36.27]I actually feel kind of safe in a car.
[16:49.32]I feel like a car is like the best place to be during a zombie apocalypse or whatever this is.
[16:54.39]And everyone says, oh man, but like, look at the Jason movies.
[16:57.03]Dude, I would run Jason over.
[16:59.62]Like, if Jason was trying to get me, I would just drive 100 miles per hour into his head.
[17:04.48]Like, I'm safe in a car.
[17:06.10]Which way do I go?
[17:12.88]What the fuck is going on?
[17:21.56]It reminds me of that Repo game.
[17:27.29]Alright, this is weird.
[17:29.53]Just go 100 and nobody can hurt you.
[17:31.53]Just go 100 and nobody can hurt you.
[17:34.61]Oops.
[17:36.19]The scariest part of this game is me crashing the car.
[17:38.39]It's not even a monster.
[17:39.39]Let's just drive a car in the woods kind of dark.
[17:47.31]Yeah, that's fucking scary.
[17:51.07]Okay.
[18:00.11]Alright, we're good.
[18:01.87]Oh my!
[18:02.45]There's a person!
[18:03.01]Oh my god, they're on the car.
[18:06.80]I can't drive anymore.
[18:08.24]Can I punch?
[18:09.58]Oh my god, somebody's clapping in the car!
[18:19.27]What?
[18:19.73]That's a... Hold right... What, am I picking it up?
[18:22.53]I'm collecting the puke.
[18:30.98]Uh... Use your newfound faith to fight back.
[18:33.32]Fully charging the flashlight will increase your damage.
[18:35.54]Careful, the power of Christ will drain your battery.
[18:40.62]Okay.
[18:44.94]So this is a scary lady here.
[18:47.22]It's attracted to light and movement.
[18:48.61]Keeping your headlights off will make you harder to find.
[18:52.35]If it can't locate you, it will grow impatient and leave.
[18:55.05]Alright, we're gonna turn lights off, turn the wipers off, everything.
[18:59.34]Stopping at a rest stop will refresh your battery, mind, and car.
[19:02.10]Rest stops also serve as checkpoints.
[19:05.36]Oh, God.
[19:05.84]Okay.
[19:08.34]How do I turn my lights off?
[19:12.75]How do I turn my flashlight off?
[19:13.99]Like this.
[19:23.85]Gas was a gas pump.
[19:33.96]shit I gotta go in alright car is coming back to life perfect okay am I good they guys keep going right
[20:03.10]Radio will react to its presence.
[20:05.14]Fight, hide, and prepare for anything as you search for a way forward.
[20:07.70]Good luck.
[20:10.32]So I hold right mouse button.
[20:11.44]I charge the... the uh... the Jesus laser?
[20:16.45]Is that a church?
[20:26.01]Am I safe at the church?
[20:26.71]Oh my god.
[20:27.59]What's that?
[20:29.96]It's a can.
[20:30.76]Is that a can of beans?
[20:32.02]Battery?
[20:33.55]Nice.
[20:40.76]I still am not even scared.
[20:41.98]I feel safe in the car.
[20:46.80]Oh, fuck.
[20:47.28]Okay.
[20:47.52]She's going to show up here in a second.
[20:50.24]Okay.
[20:50.82]Alright.
[20:52.84]Okay.
[20:52.96]I got to get ready.
[21:00.32]Is there another way to go?
[21:09.46]I'm literally going to be singing this wicked loudly.
[21:14.90]I'm covering this car in crosses and I'm going to be singing a bunch of hymns and stuff as loud as I can with the windows down.
[21:23.28]Where do I go?
[21:23.64]Do I go up here?
[21:32.00]Okay, I'm going.
[21:43.88]Oh fuck, oh fuck.
[21:50.32]Where is it, where is it?
[21:51.82]Oops.
[21:54.04]Whoa, oh fuck.
[22:09.11]I don't give a fuck.
[22:10.45]I'm gonna... I'm so sorry.
[22:28.08]Here we go.
[22:31.54]Here we go.
[22:32.22]Where is it?
[22:33.67]Where is it?
[22:37.68]Left.
[22:47.69]When this thing start to burn in my hand.
[22:54.12]With you down the road with Pastor Todd.
[22:57.30]Now let's get to this letter from Abigail out in Bellevue.
[23:01.96]Hello, Pastor Todd Roberts.
[23:04.34]I'm a long-time listener, and I love the show.
[23:07.76]I listen every day I'm able to, and it's really helped me over the years.
[23:12.25]The best Christian program... I hate this.
[23:14.07]I hate going so slow.
[23:15.19]Yesterday, my daughter and I were watching TV together... She's close.
[23:18.99]She's close.
[23:19.33]She's near.
[23:19.77]...since it's getting harder and harder to avoid all the talk about Judgment Day this and Rapture that.
[23:27.02]while we were watching my daughter asks when we go to heaven will our bodies come to or just our ghosts she was looking at her hand when she said it gave her a pause to be honest I'm not sure myself okay where luckily I need to unload this thing where the is she thinking all night can you help me out
[23:54.23]I want to give my daughter the right answer and truth be told, I want to know myself.
[24:00.31]Abigail, that is a great question.
[24:03.23]I believe the answer is in 1 Corinthians.
[24:06.12]Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable.
[24:10.50]Do I have to roll the window down first?
[24:13.02]What he's saying is that our earthly bodies aren't built for heaven.
[24:16.80]They wear out, they get sick, and they age.
[24:20.45]Our bodies will be left behind.
[24:23.67]You're driving in circles?
[24:24.97]Yeah, but am I?
[24:26.53]How do I get out of here?
[24:30.63]And as she starts to worry, remind her that there's no chores or homework in heaven, and that should cheer her right up.
[24:44.03]I think there was comfort in understanding what the future may hold, so thanks for sticking around as I read Abigail's letter.
[24:50.60]And thank you, Abigail, for rotting into the show.
[24:53.42]I hope you got the answer you were looking for.
[24:55.04]Am I going the right way?
[24:56.18]We got a lot of music coming up in the next hour, so stay tuned to Trinity 24.
[24:59.16]No?
[24:59.36]I'm going the wrong way?
[25:13.77]Why are you asking us?
[25:14.57]I don't know.
[25:14.97]I don't know.
[25:15.33]I know how to drive.
[25:16.05]I don't know directions.
[25:21.18]I haven't been here.
[25:23.56]Down here.
[25:30.41]Left or right?
[25:32.59]Left or right?
[25:35.95]Yo, W. Right?
[25:41.00]I'm just going left.
[25:55.52]Alright, I'm fine.
[26:13.13]Did I just go around in a circle again?
[26:14.63]It's so confusing in these woods!
[26:25.14]Turn around.
[26:25.66]Do it again.
[26:26.86]Dude, it's like go left or go right or go left or go right or go left or go... How did I end up going around in a circle?
[26:32.85]That's impossible!
[26:42.51]It's haunted.
[26:43.05]You only go in circles.
[26:44.31]Oh.
[27:15.05]Where is she?
[27:15.39]Where is she?
[27:15.69]Is she in the car?
[27:16.49]Is she on the car?

[37:18.74]OK, what should I do?
[37:23.81]How did you do this daily?
[37:24.77]I'm getting a rash on my neck from this game.
[37:27.95]Just go forward from here.
[37:28.71]OK.
[37:32.47]I was told by the studio to mention that apparently we now have an email address for the show.
[37:38.89]I may not know exactly how it works, but if you prefer or if you want to save a few cents on postage, you can now email us instead of writing in the old-fashioned way.
[37:48.48]That was one guy, but I believe you.
[37:51.30]Right?
[37:54.24]It'll still end up on paper for me to read.
[37:57.50]Did I get all that right?
[37:59.86]Okay, I'm getting a thumbs up from the engineer.
[38:02.66]Email's a computer thing, right?
[38:05.50]Okay, I got another thumbs up.
[38:07.88]I'm getting laughed at now.
[38:09.18]Listen, young man.
[38:11.00]I saw what computers do to kids like you.
[38:14.03]I have a grandson who spends all day on that thing, playing games and whatnot.
[38:18.99]One of the smartest kids I've ever met, but when he gets on that thing, his face just goes blank and he stares at the screen.
[38:25.38]Not a smile, not a frown, barely moving for hours.
[38:29.52]Staring at the screen.
[38:31.38]don't shake your head it's all true he used to read all day and now he's just staring at the screen every time I go visit my daughter he's like a zombie okay I might be exaggerating a little bit sometimes I enjoy being an old man I hear breathing and I think I think she's in the back of the car let's just get her sick listen did I seriously just go around okay I I'm too scared to do this one how did I go around a circle again she's in the car that's why
[38:57.83]and things stay simple.
[39:00.25]Anyway, I'll let you kids handle the computers.
[39:03.01]We have a big chunk of music coming up, so keep God in your heart and stay tuned to Trinity 24.
[39:07.65]What?
[39:08.19]Uh-oh.

[39:24.97]Up here.
[39:27.43]Alright, progress.
[39:28.56]I'm good.
[39:29.72]I have a full battery.

[39:58.61]Um, um, she's in the car.
[40:00.29]Hey!
[40:04.87]Get out of here!
[40:24.59]Get off the car!
[40:28.68]I think I made it.
[40:29.12]How do I get out of this?
[40:37.36]Ooh, battery.
[40:38.04]Thank God.
[40:44.83]Turn your lights off.
[40:51.83]What do I do here?
[41:13.25]Go right?
[41:13.65]I know.
[41:13.91]I just... I hear her breathing.
[41:25.62]I want all the lights on.
[41:26.34]I don't care.
[41:28.34]I hate this game.
[41:29.54]I hate this one.
[41:30.87]I hate this one.
[41:37.49]There's just like a maze.
[41:38.99]I just everyone told me to go right and then I went over here and there's nothing here.
[41:50.88]Oh shit.
[41:51.54]Let's gooo everybody, let's go.
[41:55.40]And then we're left or right?
[41:57.78]I'm a good driver, I'm not a good navigator.
[41:59.46]If you tell me that, hey, take a left up here.
[42:01.17]It's left, right?
[42:01.65]It's up here.
[42:15.10]Ah, she's behind me.
[42:19.06]God damn it.
[42:23.02]Oh my god, damn it!
[42:23.90]Oh my god!
[42:25.36]How?
[42:26.66]Is there two of you?
[42:27.36]Am I going the right way?
[42:35.77]Yep.
[42:39.65]Okay, um, left?
[42:40.69]I don't know.
[42:44.08]And when I am sad, he drives all my troubles away.
[42:49.80]When he's your friend, he's yours to the end.
[42:53.78]No matter what others may say.
[42:57.92]He don't tell me how I ought to be.
[43:03.16]He loves me just as I am.
[43:05.36]So when I feel blue, he's the chap I go to.
[43:11.10]For his
[43:13.67]No, I didn't actually.
[43:14.43]Did I?
[43:14.83]No.
[43:15.75]I think I'm good.
[43:23.14]Where is she?
[43:23.54]To the left, I think?
[43:25.46]Oh god.
[43:32.81]Oh fuck.
[43:34.15]Is she still here?
[43:35.81]There's so much blood in the car!
[43:56.60]Gas station, thank God.
[43:59.84]Okay, let's be careful here.
[44:01.06]Alright.
[44:04.26]I've been playing for about 40 minutes.
[44:05.37]I'm probably getting close.
[44:07.15]Am I getting close?
[44:10.66]That's a checkpoint.
[44:11.40]Is that the last checkpoint?
[44:18.56]No, you aren't.
[44:25.35]You surely are getting close.
[44:29.25]Just because I've had the game open for 40 minutes does not mean I've made 40 minutes of progress.
[44:33.31]That's true.
[44:35.39]He's here.
[44:46.31]Nice drift though.
[44:48.89]Left or right?
[44:53.36]Left?
[44:53.54]I would say left.
[45:11.84]A ton of people said right.
[45:12.90]Fuck.
[45:14.14]So many people said right.
[45:15.06]I gotta back up.
[45:21.43]Alright, there are wild bees in the car.
[45:45.93]I'd have to have the lights on.
[45:46.89]I don't care.
[45:56.53]She's still here.
[46:14.83]What if I don't?
[46:15.31]What if she just hangs out in the car?
[46:16.61]Can I get to the end and cross over the finish line?
[46:19.17]And by what place am I in?
[46:25.83]Shit.
[46:29.36]I'm playing against like 15 other people.
[46:33.24]This is a multiplayer game.
[46:35.28]I must have lost track of where everybody was, but this is a race and you don't get the haunted lady on your car.
[46:41.84]Which way do I go?
[46:47.26]This is bullshit.
[46:48.06]Yeah, I'm in 14th out of 14th place, and I'm losing by about eight minutes.
[46:52.62]You don't have to deal with the fucking grudge lady.
[46:58.75]Yeah, sorry.
[46:59.61]Toad, what'd you get hit by?
[47:00.47]A green turtle shell?
[47:01.77]Fuck you.
[47:02.27]Look what I have to deal with.
[47:17.96]I'm making like a pirate face.
[47:26.89]Where are you?
[47:32.65]You should play Mario Kart music.
[47:39.65]She's on the car.
[47:44.18]I'm dead here.
[47:48.18]I got one more shot left.
[47:49.18]It's got to count.
[47:51.32]Got it.
[47:52.16]Get up.
[47:53.40]Oh, no.
[47:58.43]Oh, boy.
[47:59.11]Oh, but that's it.
[48:00.15]I'm done.
[48:00.65]That's it.
[48:03.05]Alright.
[48:03.53]I'll do one more run with Mario Kart music, and then I'm done.
[48:09.13]What song?
[48:09.49]What's the... What's that one?
[48:22.27]Coconut Mall.
[48:23.67]Okay, here we go.
[48:26.75]I didn't set up the fucking VOD separator, but that's video game music.
[48:30.29]That's fine.
[48:30.59]Alright, give me one second.
[48:32.07]Let me get it.
[48:37.88]Coconut Mall.
[48:38.52]Mario Kart Wii.
[48:51.27]Alright, this might be loud, so just I'm warning you, like, maybe turn it down a little bit, because, like, I can't do it right this second.
[48:58.41]That's good.
[49:00.21]Is this Coconut Mall?
[49:01.11]Is it actually Coconut Mall?
[49:04.82]Okay, here we go.
[49:05.52]Let's do it.
[49:06.86]Fucking toad.
[49:20.46]Oh yeah!
[49:20.84]Oh!
[49:21.26]Ha ha ha ha ha!

[49:31.78]Just looked on a banana peel!
[49:32.88]Nobody gonna help me back here?
[49:36.24]Use a blue shell?
[49:41.28]Why am I holding this down?
[49:51.39]I'm gonna turn this radio down.
[50:00.70]This is not the right song.
[50:06.88]Oh, that's not good.
[50:20.35]Also, yeah, somebody key in, like, Luigi passing me.
[50:24.49]Yahoo!
[50:25.41]Mamma mia!
[50:44.32]It gets me every time.

[50:49.09]God damn it.
[50:54.70]Where's Peach?
[51:03.29]Peach?
[51:14.91]No, I'm not done.
[51:15.47]There's a battery right there.
[51:23.10]Uh-oh, I'm stuck.
[51:28.72]She's on the car right now.
[51:32.14]I'm just putting on another random one.
[51:33.06]What's this one?
[51:34.44]I don't know.
[51:35.12]Coconut Mall 10 hours.
[51:36.32]It's not the one I wanted to do.
[51:40.34]What is happening to my car?
[51:41.46]Is she squishing me?
[51:45.82]I didn't want this 10 hours.
[51:54.21]Oh, I got, somebody stood the squid ink.
[51:57.85]Gosh darn it, Mario.
[52:16.20]Did you just run into another circle?
[52:17.36]Fuck, I know, I know I did, but like everything was the same and there's a lady trying to kill me.
[52:24.20]No, I haven't seen this.
[52:36.27]What, did she just crash into the wall?
[52:37.99]She just crashed into the wall.
[52:44.72]She's a superhero.
[52:45.93]That's a Marvel character.
[52:47.09]She did the Marvel character dive thing from like the Eternals.
[52:59.92]And she smashed directly into the wall behind me.
[53:02.02]I can't believe she's still alive.
[53:36.06]What happened to the indicator?
[53:36.88]It just went away.
[53:40.94]Alright, I need a new Mario Kart song.
[53:42.48]This one is... I can't do this one anymore.
[53:45.42]I think I just went in another circle.
[53:51.49]Nope.
[53:52.65]Is it different?
[54:06.65]What's it called?

[55:01.19]Toad, where are you?
[55:01.93]I get it.
[55:02.33]I get it, Toad.
[55:03.39]I've been in the same position for like an hour, Toad.
[55:05.11]Is she on you?
[55:07.67]Where?
[55:09.74]Toad!
[55:12.46]Oh, she's getting Toad right now.
[55:13.60]It's bad.
[55:22.71]I can't tell what's the lady and what's Toad.
[55:25.51]I did it!
[55:25.83]I did it in 44 minutes!
[55:37.20]He actually sounds like he's having a good time right now.
[55:43.20]Toad's having a good time.
[55:47.09]That was a good one.
[55:48.03]That was called, um, A.M.
[55:50.25]Wait.
[55:59.22]What is that?
[56:10.61]Lap 2?
[56:12.97]I think this is assets that aren't quite ready yet.
[56:19.63]We're on Developer Island, I think.
[56:23.16]I think this actually is Developer Island.
[56:31.96]Just keep going for a minute?
[56:33.30]Alright, I'll keep going for a minute.
[56:40.93]This was a good one.
[56:42.49]We started off pretty strong, honestly.
[56:54.49]I thought that was Crash Bandicoot, I'm not going to lie.
[56:56.89]From far away.
[56:57.73]That's Crash Bandicoot from back here.
[57:09.30]What do I... I'm not going to scream at the credits jump scare.
[57:22.05]I'm not going to scream at the credits jump scare.
[57:25.54]I'm not going to scream at the post credits jump scare.
[57:28.50]I promise.
[57:30.10]You can turn me back up.
[57:31.54]I know you've had me at 10% volume the whole stream.
[57:33.42]I'm not going to scream at the post credits jump scare.
[57:49.25]That it?
[57:56.74]My flashlight doesn't work anymore.
[58:00.34]I can't do the flashlight thing anymore.
[58:10.85]What the fuck?
[58:23.44]Okay.
[58:27.22]Other way.
[58:35.73]I didn't go over here.
[58:36.55]Let me just check over here.
[58:39.31]This is fucked up.
[58:41.87]Dude, you know when a developer... That's definitely what they were thinking.
[58:57.25]Did I go right?
[59:06.61]This was a great one to start with, though.
[59:07.89]Holy shit.
[59:08.49]Is this just a demo, too?
[59:10.71]I wonder what the whole game would be like.
[59:18.39]This is a two clapper here.
[59:20.01]That's a double clap for this one.
[59:24.09]It's called AM Demo.
[59:26.75]It's on Itch.io.
[59:28.90]This is great.
[59:30.10]Just long enough.
[59:31.24]Just scary enough.
[59:33.04]This is a good one.
[59:33.54]This is a times two clap.
[59:35.80]Something's happening.
[59:44.34]That one was a lot harder than the other one.
[59:57.58]Do I have to hit all these?
[60:06.69]Is this some kind of secret ending or something if you hit them all?
[60:13.73]Little mini game, yeah.
[60:25.41]Or it's kind of like a little part two, isn't it?
[60:41.95]Collect the eight pages.
[60:43.09]I mean, this would be at least five.
[60:54.98]What is that?
[61:07.41]What did I miss?
[61:11.11]Did I miss?
[61:23.49]I don't know.
[61:27.67]I am coming up on an ad break here.
[61:29.59]I do want to get up and... I want to make sure there's no ads on anything I'm doing, so... Holy shit!
[61:37.47]I thought he jumped in the car and he didn't.
[61:39.53]That was just a really weird puppetry.
[61:54.77]Kind of going the other way now.
[61:55.63]Yeah, I'm going backwards now, but there's still, I can still see him.
[61:59.89]I don't get it.
[62:06.93]Is it under the bleachers?
[62:18.55]I wonder if he just keeps appearing and you just have to bump into him like five to ten times.
[62:25.11]I don't know.
[62:35.30]Oh, he's in the car.
[62:36.80]He's in the car.
[62:38.02]He's in the car.
[62:38.60]Alright, I don't know what to do.
[62:46.87]I got a lot more of these to play, so I'm going to move on.
[62:50.07]To your left?
[63:01.93]Seems like an unfinished area, maybe?
[63:04.49]What about up here?
[63:24.08]I think I just went around a circle again?
[63:25.59]Turn the radio on, maybe?
[63:27.31]Oh my God!
[63:32.63]Alright, I'm going to take a break.
[63:35.93]I'll come back and I will drive around for one or two more minutes.
[63:40.27]But I need to go pee out all this.
[63:43.05]I'm going to piss out.
[63:43.96]I don't even know what I'm going to piss out here.
[63:48.64]But I'll be right back.
[63:50.86]Ads incoming here.
[63:52.52]And I'll be back in a few minutes, probably three or four minutes.
[63:56.68]Game is paused, so we're good.
[64:03.97]I'll see you guys very shortly.
[64:05.49]See you soon.
[66:53.54]So,
[68:19.26]Welcome back.
[68:20.14]How are you?
[68:21.20]I got up.
[68:21.68]I moved around.
[68:22.43]I expelled a lot of the demons that were in my bladder.
[68:26.19]Feel good.
[68:28.05]Just fucking hanging out, you know.
[68:29.81]Fucking.
[68:32.05]Yeah, I swear I like to be, like to sound like, you know, I gotta fucking, you know, connect with the youth, you know.
[68:37.56]That's why I say fucking.
[68:42.70]Your hair looks luxurious.
[68:44.28]Appreciate that.
[68:44.87]Thank you.
[68:51.40]Alright, so anybody know if there's anything else to do here?
[68:54.68]Or is this just kind of we got to the end of the demo?
[68:58.20]Because I'm willing to go to the next one.
[69:05.54]There's a little bit more.
[69:07.21]There's a little end there.
[69:08.03]Okay.
[69:09.17]I'll go for about five more minutes, but I got a lot of these to go through, so.
[69:12.15]There's about five minutes left.
[69:16.35]Okay.
[69:16.81]Alright, let's do it.
[69:26.71]And you should be able to see.
[69:27.69]Hi there.
[69:33.03]I like it like this.
[69:34.20]I like the kind of darker atmosphere.
[69:35.86]It makes for... I don't want some bright-ass light.
[69:40.46]I did that before.
[69:41.38]I've done that.
[69:41.88]No, fuck that.
[69:43.66]I'm not doing that anymore.
[69:44.58]We're not doing any bright lights in my face.
[69:48.31]We're doing lights up here.
[69:51.35]Nice theater lighting.
[69:54.15]And it just starts with Shakespeare.
[69:55.95]Okay.
[69:58.67]Let's just... I'll do it for another five minutes.
[70:00.78]I think I'm on the right road.
[70:06.78]We'll see.
[70:07.24]There's no power.
[70:08.02]I need to turn around.
[70:14.87]Turn around.
[70:21.61]Yeah, let's look.
[70:22.59]OK, so should I just stay on the road or go straight?
[70:25.21]What's supposed to stay on the road?
[70:31.57]Turn the radio on.
[70:32.21]I don't know if there is.
[70:38.21]The radio is usable anymore.
[70:42.42]Nothing else.
[70:47.72]I want to see where this road goes.
[70:49.36]Stay on the road, OK?
[70:54.01]oh shit alright well we found it aliens it's probably aliens more road alright let's go
[71:24.96]Uh, here comes the jump scare right before I get to the end of this road.
[71:28.04]Yep, here it comes.
[71:29.24]Let's just say the end.
[71:35.72]Am I going to get hit by a the end?
[71:54.33]Checkpoint.
[72:30.97]Parking garage?
[72:34.53]Hello?
[72:54.73]My car is getting messed up so bad.
[73:01.90]I don't think I can hit this guy that many more times before the car is destroyed.
[73:13.14]Left or right?
[73:13.70]Where am I?
[73:15.83]Oh, there he is.
[73:28.09]Care more about your car than the people you are hitting.
[73:33.92]I can go up?
[73:36.41]What the fuck am I doing?
[73:40.55]Dude, what is going on here?
[73:42.91]Okay, the dev of this game... ...just made this, like, crack area.
[73:50.64]And I kind of like it.
[74:00.14]What...
[74:03.65]He's back again.
[74:05.10]I think I came this way, didn't I?
[74:19.49]No, did I?
[74:21.37]I don't know.
[74:21.79]I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[74:40.33]Shit.
[74:41.69]Something on the car.
[74:52.30]There is an end.
[74:53.04]It's behind you.
[74:53.62]Uh, what?
[75:07.95]Anybody know where to go?
[75:11.33]Back this way?
[75:12.61]Go towards the base.
[75:15.05]You got one guide?
[75:15.71]Oh, I got one guide.
[75:18.62]Towards the base?
[75:19.22]I appreciate all the help.
[75:24.04]I really do.
[75:25.90]Yeah, I think, yeah, it's definitely over here.
[75:27.28]Alright, so, towards the base.
[75:52.62]I'm losing control of the car.
[76:01.23]Dude what the fuck is going on?
[76:33.12]Bro.
[76:35.04]Bro, what is that?
[76:38.77]Yikes.
[76:48.11]What do I do?
[76:55.38]Oh, I can go down.
[77:16.19]Good.
[77:25.08]Your engine light is on.
[77:26.14]I think I have way more problems to worry about than that.
[77:31.00]I'm getting to the core.
[77:33.28]I'm just going to bump him because he's actually going to break.
[77:35.07]The car is going to break.
[77:35.69]I go towards the red light.
[78:10.13]It's another tunnel.
[78:11.31]Alright, this has gotta be it.
[78:13.33]This is definitely the end of the game coming up here.
[78:21.28]Apparently I found Lavos.
[78:39.62]Bed of Chaos.
[78:40.52]Yeah, it's.
[78:42.12]It's gonna be happy.
[78:42.80]It's gonna say happy birthday at the end.
[78:44.48]Watch.
[78:45.64]Give me a birthday had a birthday cake and it's going to go.
[78:47.62]Yeah, you know that that default.
[78:51.08]There's a person in that way.
[78:52.14]I got it.
[78:52.52]I'm fine.
[78:53.76]What the fuck was that?
[78:54.57]Yeah.
[79:03.33]Yeah, what was any of that?
[79:04.93]What was that?
[79:05.91]Should I play it again?
[79:07.39]I mean, maybe, yeah.
[79:12.66]I can't use this footage.
[79:14.58]Half my playthrough is missing.
[79:18.72]It's not corrupt.
[79:19.64]Is it going to exit the game or something?
[79:24.73]It never leaves the end screen.
[79:26.55]Thanks for playing.
[79:30.57]The mouse is moving and the music keeps looping.
[79:36.86]Over and over.
[79:38.72]It's going to be an Alt F4.
[79:39.94]Yeah.
[79:41.30]Whatever.
[79:46.40]No, I mean it was a good length.
[79:48.14]Let's get the claps in the chat, please.
[80:04.54]It was a car game, so it automatically gets one full letter grade.
[80:09.32]That was good.
[80:09.66]That's fun.
[80:12.62]Cars all messed up now.
[80:15.02]Play it again.
[80:16.11]What happens if I do it again?
[80:18.71]I'm just curious because it looked everything looks all screwed up.
[80:24.61]It was my choice.
[80:27.43]Right?
[80:38.44]I wonder if anything's different in the beginning.
[80:40.10]It is different.
[80:42.62]Is it a different monster now?
[80:44.04]Uh, I don't think I have access to the flashlight anymore.
[81:02.07]Yeah, I don't.
[81:03.40]This is hard mode.
[81:15.97]Alright, I get it.
[81:16.71]I get it.
[81:17.13]It's a little more.
[81:17.71]It's a little deeper than just playing a demo of the scary lady screaming at you.
[81:31.28]I don't even have a flashlight.
[81:32.50]Are you sure you have to hit this guy every time?
[81:41.44]I think... I didn't have to right there, but I did.
[81:48.28]I'm imagining it's part of it.
[81:50.94]I just want to see what happens.
[81:51.93]I just want to see what this guy does.
[81:53.87]Because we're back at the beginning of the regular game now, but it's not.
[82:00.79]So I'm just curious.
[82:04.55]What's the big deal here?
[82:07.34]And does this guy puke blood on you?
[82:17.14]We got other games to play?
[82:19.76]Yeah, I know.
[82:20.56]I know.
[82:21.20]I'm good.
[82:21.61]I'm good.
[82:21.99]I just have... Okay.
[82:36.48]Why would I roll the window down?
[82:37.46]What are you doing?
[82:39.34]Okay.
[82:40.36]Oh, no.
[82:40.72]It's just harder and scarier.
[82:41.93]Okay.
[82:42.27]Yeah.
[82:42.47]No way.
[82:47.87]Okay.
[82:48.57]I'm done.
[82:55.20]Got it.
[82:55.36]Alright.
[82:56.18]That was a good one.
[82:56.90]Let's do the next one.
[82:57.60]What do I got here?
[82:59.08]I got...
[83:07.05]A couple of these are like 15 minutes.
[83:09.31]I want to play the elevator one.
[83:10.55]I just got this one.
[83:11.25]I just randomly was picking out games.
[83:13.51]Let's take a quick second.
[83:18.06]Get it.
[83:21.82]This one is called Elevator Nightmare.
[83:26.94]Elevator Nightmare.
[83:30.44]Oh, that's cool.
[83:30.84]Yeah, the mods are throwing up the links to the games.
[83:35.62]That's a good one.
[83:36.10]I like that one a lot.
[83:37.66]Alright, Elevator Nightmare coming up.
[83:39.00]I'm going to be careful with your audio.
[83:40.61]Some of these, I don't know.
[83:41.61]Some of these are indie projects.
[83:43.43]I don't know how loud they are.
[83:44.87]I'm just going to open them.
[83:46.55]I dropped it on my end, but it could be pretty bad.
[83:49.47]So here we go.
[83:56.70]Shit, it opened on the other monitor.
[83:58.00]Fuck.
[84:01.30]Hold on a second.
[84:07.63]I think I have to open it down here.
[84:11.98]Shit.
[84:14.82]Ah, it's opening on my other monitor.
[84:18.02]It's alright.
[84:18.86]I can do it.
[84:19.30]I can just move some stuff.
[84:20.00]I want to get the chat down here.
[84:30.72]Get it together, man.
[84:31.92]I know, I know, I know.
[84:34.22]Alright, elevator.
[84:36.00]Nightmare.
[84:46.20]I got you guys down here now.
[84:47.22]Okay.
[84:49.50]I'm going to turn the volume up.
[84:51.21]Let's see if it's loud.
[84:52.13]Let's see if I need to do anything with it.
[84:55.09]Quality, very high.
[84:56.49]Audio is good.
[84:58.01]Sensitivity is good.
[85:01.53]Okay, what does this say?
[85:02.27]I'm going to turn it up on my end with my remote control.
[85:10.12]Why are you wearing the Mega Milk shirt?
[85:13.42]I'm making references to, like, a 2017 stream.
[85:17.32]Yeah, I still have t-shirts.
[85:18.42]I still fit into clothes when I was 25.
[85:20.64]That's pro- Is that a bad thing?
[85:23.62]Yeah, I fit into clothes when I was 25 and I'm almost 40.
[85:34.25]What's that?
[85:34.99]Look at that.
[85:35.85]Right?
[85:36.19]This thing?
[85:37.01]Look at that.
[85:37.59]This thing?
[85:40.23]I'm doing just fine.
[85:40.85]Okay.
[85:41.25]Okay.
[85:43.57]Alright, are we ready?
[85:44.11]Uh, elevator nightmare.
[85:48.18]Case notes.
[85:48.76]The remains of three... I can't... I have to, like, hold this up like this.
[85:52.36]Where's a light that I can... Q. What is Q?
[85:55.08]Oh, you can put things down.
[85:58.58]Case notes.
[86:00.50]The remains of three people were found in the Backwood neighborhood.
[86:03.71]A resident of a home in the neighborhood claimed she saw a bald man on all fours dragging an object that looked like the head of... of what?
[86:15.18]Okay.
[86:16.76]Floor 6, apartment 14.
[86:18.02]Wait, am I gonna grab onto shit?
[86:29.44]Alright, my back is really fucked up.
[86:33.74]That was loud, but it's alright.
[86:42.52]You gotta be careful with these.
[86:43.60]Alright, wait, wait, what was it?
[86:47.07]Don't trust her.
[86:50.65]I'm going to turn this down a little because I feel like we're going to get an explosion.
[86:54.86]And I am permanently traumatized by explosions.
[86:58.08]So just be aware there might be a fucking explosion.
[87:10.32]Floor 6, apartment 14.
[87:17.09]We're gonna get exploded.
[87:24.16]This elevator's a piece of shit.
[87:40.25]Oh shit, what is it?
[87:42.79]Do I call?
[87:43.55]Open the door.
[87:56.07]What happened?
[88:00.87]What do I do?
[88:01.37]Wait.
[88:01.61]I can hold the plate?
[88:10.23]Plate, hold.
[88:27.34]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[88:34.62]I can't pull it off?
[88:35.68]Come on, I can rip this thing off.
[88:41.69]I'm holding it down.
[88:46.01]What is that?
[88:46.35]Oh!
[88:57.97]what is this little thing?
[88:59.31]it's this little guy how do I get out of here?
[89:20.91]he closed me in
[89:31.13]Okay, I think it works again.
[89:32.09]Hello?
[89:34.88]Hello?
[89:35.68]Wait, he's back!
[89:39.64]Sorry, I can't help you.
[89:54.27]There's something weird going on here.
[90:04.01]I think I have to get it in one go.
[90:05.51]Alright, so he's here and then he's going to scream at me.
[90:10.71]Okay, good.
[90:12.23]Now what?
[90:12.57]Do I jump out?
[90:16.93]What did he say?
[90:21.98]What did he say?
[90:22.54]I think I died.
[90:33.32]I'm not happy with this outcome.
[90:35.80]Oh shit, did I?
[90:36.82]I think I lost.
[90:37.56]Alright, what about if we go to like five?
[90:42.20]Okay, here we go.
[91:01.77]He's going to say...
[91:04.32]I'm sorry.
[91:05.04]I'm going to get grabbed and killed.
[91:06.28]But then don't open that.
[91:09.20]So how do I get out of here?
[91:16.26]If I open these, the little guy comes and screams at me.
[91:19.45]I can't seem to open this.
[91:27.71]What if I... Okay, what if I switch hands here?
[91:29.19]Hold on.

[91:58.34]Are you the guy in the elevator that pushes all the buttons?
[92:03.26]Hold and pull back.
[92:07.66]It doesn't want to stay gripping on the right side.
[92:12.78]It's going to be like a perfect spot.
[92:13.78]I can do it, right?
[92:16.14]Hold the mouse buttons.
[92:18.22]I'm holding it.
[92:18.65]Alright, what if I do?
[92:20.17]Okay, hold on.
[92:24.27]It doesn't want to keep my hand in this one.
[92:27.01]What if I get really close?
[92:28.89]Oh, hold on.
[92:32.59]Yes!
[92:33.11]Alright, I just get really close.

[96:03.60]Okay, is there a checkpoint?
[96:07.62]Alright, what does this say?
[96:11.50]Phone locked.
[96:12.56]I'm being hunted by monsters.
[96:13.75]If anyone sees this note in this cursed house, they're around.
[96:17.63]I'm trying to enter the four-digit system code for the elevator.
[96:20.35]Door release 31... 15?
[96:20.93]Okay.
[96:21.19]3-1-1-5 is the door code.

[97:29.32]I didn't even get to do the door code.
[97:30.84]I just got crushed by the elevator.
[97:41.13]I don't know why you would pretzel yourself through the elevator and crush all of your bones.
[97:47.36]Alright, that was elevator nightmare.
[97:51.16]That was a good one.
[97:52.96]I love this shit.
[97:54.34]Okay.
[97:56.11]What's up next?
[97:58.15]Next up is called Beacon's End.
[98:01.46]There are probably multiple endings.
[98:02.56]Yeah, probably.
[98:07.78]Beacon's End.
[98:11.09]I think this one might... Let's see where this one opens.
[98:20.95]Okay, this one's on this other screen, so that's good.
[98:23.87]Flashing lights, loud noises, and disturbing images in this game.
[98:26.66]Alright, it's a horror game.
[98:29.60]The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is the fear of the unknown.
[98:34.28]That was Lovecraft.
[98:35.12]I just haven't captured it yet.
[98:36.08]I'm just making sure you know.
[98:36.80]This one looks cool.
[98:39.90]Alright, hold on a sec.
[98:51.35]Can you see it?
[98:52.07]There we are.
[98:56.66]This one is got that kind of PlayStation 1 aesthetic.
[98:59.76]Let me move some stuff around real quick.
[99:15.24]Oh!
[99:15.40]Jumpy.
[99:16.68]Jumpy tonight.
[99:17.72]Okay.
[99:22.40]What the hell?
[99:25.12]What the hell?
[99:31.35]Alright, let's do it.
[99:32.05]Apparently this one's pretty short too.
[99:33.61]So let's just give it a go.
[99:35.10]It's apparently very scary.
[99:37.04]How's the audio though?
[99:38.14]That's important to know.
[99:41.18]I think it's fine right here.
[99:41.96]Alright, that's loud, but I think it's fine.
[99:49.16]Alright, let's do it.
[99:50.86]I'm ready.
[99:55.62]Oh, this is crusty.
[99:57.40]This is super crunchy.
[99:58.52]Alright.
[100:01.81]Oh yeah, apparently this game's got a lot of flashing lights.
[100:03.93]It has a lot of like loud sounds and stuff.
[100:06.33]So, just be aware of that.
[100:09.77]It's gonna be crazy.
[100:13.26]So please be aware.
[100:14.32]Here's your warning right now.
[100:16.64]Okay.
[100:18.90]That lightning was inside of the house.
[100:23.29]Ooy.
[100:28.45]Put a warning on the- Maybe put a warning in the title?
[100:37.95]God, that's going to hit me every time.
[100:39.27]I'll open the door.
[101:01.73]Oh shit, OK, I'm holding somebody.
[101:10.47]Get rid of your wife.
[101:14.21]Okay.
[101:14.93]Oh shit.
[101:40.54]Oh, should I just throw it in the ocean?
[101:49.42]Oh, up here.
[102:09.97]Okay, damn.
[102:12.45]What if that was it?
[102:16.81]Alright, let's go.
[102:18.39]Alright, what's the next one?
[102:19.25]Just dump my wife in the river and that's the end of the game.
[102:27.40]I'm being shot with a gun every time that happens.
[102:34.82]Alright.
[102:35.78]There's definitely more to this.
[102:36.56]Let's go.
[102:44.83]She's going to come back and she's going to try to light the lighthouse.
[102:48.33]Yeah, that's not the end.
[102:49.27]The wife is going to come back.
[102:50.75]She's going to strangle me with piano wire.
[103:02.60]Can I not go in?
[103:06.02]Item maybe in the house?
[103:27.23]Whoever is editing this, whatever editor is editing this for the second channel, I have a very special request.
[103:33.51]I want you to take every time that that has happened and just bring them back to back.
[103:38.55]So it's just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[103:44.14]At the end of this one.
[103:46.50]And you give a warning, you know, like, oh, hey, Jeremy said to do this, so I guess I'm going to do it.
[103:52.98]I just, I kind of want to see, you know those videos where it's like Macho Man?
[103:58.31]And he's like... That's what I'm kind of looking for.
[104:05.11]Because I feel like it's going to happen like 50 times, and it might be pretty interesting.
[104:09.01]But make a warning saying you're going to get like flashed and sucks, but you know what I'm... How do I light the lighthouse?
[104:18.75]Oh shit.
[104:29.02]Yeah, oh I oh OK this way.
[104:37.80]What is this?
[104:42.94]I do appreciate the indicator.
[104:45.18]I do appreciate the indicator.
[104:52.51]I'm giving him a lot of material here.
[105:22.20]I said no more pictures.
[105:23.56]Oh, it didn't flash.
[105:24.44]Never mind.
[105:28.90]Okay.
[105:43.13]I like this one.
[105:43.81]I like how cool this one is.
[105:45.31]I think I did it.
[105:58.71]Oh, I thought that was a person.
[106:11.50]Lighthouse is lit.
[106:14.57]Back to the back to bed.
[106:26.58]Day one?
[106:26.94]What do you mean, day one?
[106:44.23]Light the lighthouse.
[106:46.60]Oh, shit.
[106:47.18]This is going to get progressively more and more awful, isn't it?
[106:57.42]Alright, we gotta go get the, what is it, the Flint?
[107:22.90]I gotta get this for the video.
[107:25.18]Not that one.
[107:25.84]After.
[107:26.28]Hold on.
[107:27.30]I gotta get this for the video.
[107:28.24]I gotta get this for the video.
[107:29.62]I don't care.
[107:36.33]It'd be funny if they don't even do this.
[107:52.66]My eyes!
[107:53.20]They burn!
[108:02.17]Why does your neck look so long?
[108:04.35]I don't know, because I went like... I've got like a V-neck on.
[108:18.42]Shut up.
[108:28.92]Alright, lighthouse is on again.
[108:29.98]You look like a giraffe.
[108:36.78]OK.
[108:44.91]I have to do something else too.
[108:50.68]We need to count how many miles away it is so I can know when it's coming next, right?
[110:07.39]What?
[110:11.92]Oh, how many booms are we gonna give it?
[110:14.54]We're gonna give it... One!
[110:22.55]Shit!
[110:23.03]You're supposed to say boom!
[110:26.27]Whatever.
[110:32.23]How'd they do that?
[110:33.41]I fucked it up.
[110:34.72]I screwed it up.
[110:35.48]I messed it up.
[110:36.20]Sorry.
[110:42.36]What is this?
[110:43.68]Oh!
[110:47.04]Oh no!
[110:47.37]It's Mr. Mouse!
[110:52.79]Something happened to him!
[110:55.01]No!
[111:25.31]I see two rats in the bottom right.
[111:28.87]That's fair.
[111:29.51]That's fair.
[111:32.51]Well, I guess we have to use it.
[111:33.25]I'm going to have to start cutting off arms now.
[111:39.31]When are you going to play VRChat?
[111:42.00]I don't know.
[111:43.68]Poke... We could do a horseman VRChat probably.
[111:48.06]Poke was talking about it.
[111:50.93]Poke's definitely the guy that I would want, uh, quarterbacking the VR.
[112:02.36]I will tell you though, I, those VR streams are just, they're, they're going to have to be like two hours and 30 minutes.
[112:08.97]You put on the Lord of the Rings when that stream starts and when the credits are rolling, that's when I'm probably going to take the headset off.
[112:26.74]Wait, why is it not... I lit it.
[112:30.72]Why is it doing this?
[112:37.22]Did it not work?
[112:46.89]The old one will come in three days.
[112:54.60]Want some more?
[112:55.26]Had to scratch that five out.
[113:02.36]Oh shit.
[113:06.04]Like I must be so stupid.
[113:12.45]Can I not keep track of five days?
[113:16.31]Like, oh, this guy's dumb as shit.
[113:17.71]I got to make sure he needs to be told.
[113:31.35]Find something alive.
[113:35.18]Fish or something at the dock?
[113:37.30]That I would think.
[113:43.89]Yep.
[113:53.41]What the hell was that?
[113:54.65]That was actually kind of crazy.
[114:35.94]More days.
[114:46.70]Getting kind of messed up in here.
[114:48.56]Can you move the cam?
[114:59.99]The windows blocking it.
[115:03.25]I can't.
[115:04.47]Can't do it.
[115:05.15]I can't reach.
[115:08.60]Almost time.
[115:20.80]I want to see if they crossed it out.
[115:27.04]Yeah, they crossed it out.
[115:37.39]More.
[115:40.57]More.
[115:42.63]More.
[115:45.40]So, you want me to put my hands on my head like this?
[116:09.50]What is this?
[116:11.10]Oh, I don't like this.
[116:16.44]We keep just feeding dead birds.
[116:20.32]More.
[116:21.20]Feed me more dead birds.
[116:23.80]Yes, we have rats and dead fucking seagulls.
[116:26.82]Mmm, delicious.
[116:29.76]I haven't had to carve an arm off yet.
[116:39.01]I'm gonna have to cut my arms off or something.
[116:41.51]It's gonna be messed up.
[116:46.63]Alright, this is it.
[116:54.54]I'm very interested in what happens here now.
[117:12.31]Are we good?
[117:28.29]It comes in five days.
[117:29.57]It's coming today.
[117:42.65]Well, I appreciate you actually cleaning the side of the house.
[117:47.45]Can you scream in reverse?
[117:51.77]I don't have any instructions.
[118:11.85]Is he going to come out of the water?
[118:13.65]It's going to be huge.
[118:14.19]He's going to come out of the water.
[118:18.72]Cthulhu is coming out.
[118:24.70]What?
[118:24.94]I don't know what else to do.
[118:29.19]Feed me what?
[118:29.87]Feed me what?
[118:30.83]I don't have to feed me myself, right?
[118:48.75]Go get another dead bird.
[118:51.85]Feed him another dead bird.
[118:55.29]It's gotta be me.
[118:56.74]It's definitely me.
[119:07.96]Is it not?
[119:15.49]What do you want from me?
[119:21.46]It's definitely your wife.
[119:24.26]I threw my wife in the ocean.
[119:26.02]It's definitely eaten the wife already.
[119:27.34]Yeah, can I go in the lighthouse?
[119:49.05]Oh shit, I can go in here.
[119:50.07]Hold on.
[119:52.27]Give it all.
[119:53.37]Give yourself.
[119:55.57]Give yourself.
[119:57.91]Give yourself.
[120:00.30]Give flesh.
[120:01.82]I have to throw myself in here.
[120:05.92]God.
[120:07.74]What?
[120:42.97]That was fucked up.
[120:44.49]That was a leg.
[120:45.65]Alright, I gotta put the leg in here.
[120:49.53]That was kind of a Charlie Brown scream.
[120:51.25]That's how you know it hurt.
[120:59.52]OK.
[121:00.92]Can I even walk?
[121:13.18]I guess I'm hopping around.
[121:16.60]Satisfied.
[121:19.80]Blood moon.
[121:23.44]We good.
[121:26.13]That thing's gonna.
[121:27.23]Oh, that thing looks scary.
[121:38.57]Did I try to go back to bed?
[121:45.20]Nope.
[121:47.14]I just gotta walk up there, I think, and get consumed by whatever it is.
[121:53.86]Just leap it off.
[122:18.59]What do I do?
[122:19.47]What is that?
[122:27.91]Up on the top of that thing?
[122:29.12]Oh, yup, up there.
[122:44.76]Okay.
[122:52.72]Alright, let's see what happens.
[122:53.38]It's gonna jump out.
[122:54.20]It's gonna be a huge Cthulhu face.
[123:40.72]Wait, wait, wait.
[123:41.66]Did I miss it?
[123:42.32]Did I miss the scare?
[123:43.10]What happened?
[123:45.42]What?
[123:46.10]I was ready to be scared.
[123:47.50]I think I was inside of it.
[123:50.54]Oh, fuck.
[123:53.54]I missed the scare.
[123:54.48]Fuck.
[123:56.10]Alright.
[123:57.20]I'm going to take a break.
[123:57.84]I'll be right back.
[123:58.42]It's been an hour.
[124:00.15]Oh, shit.
[124:01.19]I loved that.
[124:01.69]That was a good one.
[124:02.35]Alright.
[124:03.01]I'll be right back.
[124:06.63]I'm going to try to get there fast.
[124:08.23]I want to see that.
[124:08.81]Alright.
[124:09.35]Hear me.
[124:11.28]Damn it.
[124:13.00]That was a good one too.
[124:16.34]See you guys in three or four minutes.
[124:17.24]How's it going to start?
[124:19.30]Fuck.
[124:31.99]Did I go?
[124:32.67]I got to turn that off.
[124:33.89]Hold on.
[124:36.19]Did I walk too far?
[124:37.99]I missed it.
[124:41.04]I must have walked too far or turned around at the wrong time.
[124:45.46]I like that one a lot too.
[124:46.58]That was a good one.
[124:47.22]Alright, I'll be right back.
[125:37.35]you
[127:34.73]Alright, so I want to get the general consensus from the council here.
[127:41.27]The general consensus from the council.
[127:42.55]Do you want me to speed run that so we can see the jump scare?
[127:45.29]Because this one was actually pretty cool.
[127:47.13]I like this one a lot.
[127:50.77]What does the council have to say?
[127:55.26]Just YouTube it as well.
[128:00.00]You said that ending.
[128:00.64]What is it?
[128:04.17]Because I know I could just run around.
[128:06.01]But if people want to move on, we can move on.
[128:08.55]You could also just go watch it on YouTube too and get scared yourself.
[128:16.29]Put the speedrun timer up.
[128:17.33]Go.
[128:27.20]Is YouTube it?
[128:28.04]Alright, I'll YouTube it.
[128:28.82]Hold on.
[128:37.30]Or you could go see it yourself too.
[128:42.14]Actually, I don't think I want to YouTube it.
[128:43.62]I think I want to see that.
[128:46.90]It's in a video player.
[128:48.07]No, I want to see it.
[128:56.75]Yeah, I'll get through it quick.
[129:04.68]Okay, we'll end with that.
[129:11.33]I'll come back to it and we'll do it again.
[129:14.40]Because, yeah, I don't want you to.
[129:15.26]I want to see it.
[129:15.96]I want to be sitting here and I want to be engrossed in it.
[129:19.50]So I'll end with it tonight.
[129:24.23]Alright, let's let's keep going.
[129:26.75]Coming up next.
[129:30.43]I would give the double claps for that one.
[129:31.91]I think I screwed it up.
[129:34.41]That was my own fault.
[129:35.41]I backed up, I think, too far, and I stood there for too long, and I just... I think I turned at the wrong... I was... I think that was on me.
[129:45.00]Alright, let's keep going.
[129:46.96]I've got plenty of other stuff to do.
[129:52.64]Next one is... Hold on.
[129:59.46]Exit this one.
[130:00.32]Alright.
[130:04.47]Which one of these sounds are good to you?
[130:07.25]It wasn't a human.
[130:11.43]I think it wasn't a human sounds pretty good.
[130:14.55]It wasn't a human.
[130:23.36]Find out.
[130:25.60]Audio seems like it's in a good spot.
[130:26.92]We'll find out.
[130:35.97]This one looks like another short one that's... It looks like this one is in a grocery store or convenience.
[130:43.06]This is a convenience store one.
[130:49.26]And can we see it?
[130:51.12]Here it is.
[130:51.72]Okay, cool.
[130:55.37]Your webcam looks like creepypasta material when you have it at 160p.
[130:57.89]Yeah, we don't need high quality shit.
[131:01.39]Hold on, I can't see.
[131:02.47]There we go.
[131:09.67]I would love to close this.
[131:10.57]Alright.
[131:10.79]Alright.
[131:11.75]This one's called, uh, it wasn't a human.
[131:14.30]I'm ready.
[131:14.62]Let's take a look at the settings.
[131:15.92]Uh, FPS cap 60 and let's play.
[131:18.76]Let's see how it is.
[131:24.00]Take a look at the store.
[131:28.43]Oh, wow.
[131:28.81]I had no mouse in this one.
[131:31.41]This one's WASD.
[131:32.47]Let me turn it up a little.
[131:34.79]Might be a mistake, but I'm going to do it.
[131:37.15]WASD kind of, it's like tank controls.
[131:51.32]Those are breathing.
[132:01.95]Oh my god, alright.
[132:05.08]Oh, I feel like I have drunk goggles on.
[132:10.51]Okay, I'm looking at the store.
[132:19.78]Okay, go out.
[132:23.93]How do I use this?
[132:25.59]Is there a controls button?
[132:31.11]E?
[132:31.71]F?
[132:32.29]Okay, F. I don't need to leave now.
[132:43.14]Oh, E puts your head down.
[132:44.82]I feel like I've played this one and it was the worst jumpscare I've ever had in my life and it actually took a few years off my life.
[133:00.23]Smoke break?
[133:07.02]Count the money from the register.
[133:11.28]The puppet combo one?
[133:12.14]Yeah, this is going to be one of those.
[133:13.34]It's going to sprint at me and scream in my face.
[133:16.32]Alright, count the money.
[133:25.80]10, 20, 30, 40, 50.
[133:29.16]What?
[133:29.34]Did I do it?
[133:42.29]I can't leave.
[133:42.83]I think I did it.
[133:48.68]It's going to be fucking loud.
[133:59.04]I actually think I might turn it down.
[134:00.61]We all know what's going to happen in two minutes.
[134:03.71]Every single one of us knows what happens.
[134:25.22]Is that a can of Pringles?
[134:27.08]I think it's royalty-free Pringles.
[134:28.69]You can't really tell.
[134:29.37]Okay.
[134:35.07]I don't need to leave now.
[134:35.99]Am I missing something?
[134:42.24]Hmm.
[134:42.84]I must have misheard that.
[134:57.79]It's going to be loud.
[135:04.61]I don't want to turn around.
[135:05.75]I know what happens.
[135:17.66]What the fuck?
[135:18.46]Help me.
[135:20.12]What happened?
[135:21.22]Something was chasing me.
[135:23.12]Something?
[135:24.28]It wasn't a human.
[135:26.36]You want me to call the police?
[135:28.22]Yes, please.
[135:42.13]Did they get him?
[135:58.49]It wasn't a human.
[135:59.27]It was a pig.
[136:03.25]Now that's a way to subvert expectations for sure.
[136:05.25]Uh-oh.
[136:12.46]Turn your speakers down.
[136:13.86]Everyone should be operating at 8% right now volume.
[136:16.86]You all should be operating at 10% volume right now.
[136:53.73]We good?
[136:57.09]Dude, doesn't this, doesn't this happen in that other game?
[136:59.21]And I come back in here, I, I know, okay, everybody relax.
[137:09.74]What the fuck's going on?
[137:11.78]I turned it off?
[137:25.98]okay there we go we're good what the fuck
[138:17.34]I'm just waiting for it.
[138:32.35]Fuck!
[138:35.37]Well, it definitely wasn't a human, I will tell you.
[138:41.16]Let's get the claps in the chat, please.
[138:42.40]I think that's the end of that one.
[138:44.64]Wasn't human.
[138:52.04]Alright, that was that one.
[138:55.66]I want to make one of these convenience store games and have it just be like the horrors of being in the convenience store.
[139:08.36]Hey, it did get me.
[139:09.12]It got me twice.
[139:09.70]Alright, how about the hidden lair?
[139:18.26]You know what?
[139:18.82]Let's do a vote.
[139:20.80]The Hidden Lair, Silent Burial, or Salt.
[139:27.26]Which one of those sounds the most intriguing to you?
[139:35.52]I'm seeing a lot of Salts.
[139:41.27]That's a lot of Salt.
[139:42.47]Everybody wants to see it, apparently.
[139:46.01]Apparently the game is called Salt.
[139:49.84]We good?
[139:50.90]I think I'm just going to go for it.
[139:57.44]Okay.
[140:06.73]Good to go.
[140:09.37]English.
[140:11.57]Salt.
[140:20.76]Friglav demanding sacrifices.
[140:36.80]Another working day has come to an end.
[140:39.16]Finally, I'm almost home.
[140:43.57]Oh, new thoughts appeared.
[140:44.86]Press tab to view.
[140:47.72]You have a fucking brain?
[140:48.92]Alright.
[140:50.90]My mind says get to the apartment.
[140:54.98]I like this touch.
[140:56.24]That's a nice touch.
[140:58.42]I'm going to turn this down a little.
[140:59.72]I can already tell that was very loud.
[141:05.67]Okay, so this shows your thoughts.
[141:08.25]Get to your apartment.
[141:23.83]View current.
[141:24.49]Okay.
[141:25.37]My mind.
[141:26.07]Current goals.
[141:26.75]Yep.
[141:43.65]I love the different pitch changes between each step.
[141:48.39]Dude.
[141:49.07]Dude.
[141:49.77]Dude.
[141:50.45]Dude.
[141:51.15]Dude.
[141:57.19]I walk a... Oh, hold on.
[141:58.25]I can do it.
[142:01.42]I walk a lonely road.
[142:03.42]I was going to do it.
[142:10.47]Somebody said it, so I should do it.
[142:11.57]Did I walk the complete wrong way?
[142:15.53]No, I'm good.
[142:26.96]Gonna be a wrap.
[142:51.84]Oh, that's my footsteps changing on the different pavement.
[142:55.88]I thought somebody was creeping up on me.
[143:02.08]A cat?
[143:07.00]Hello.
[143:07.96]Can I do anything?
[143:11.10]Can I pet the cat or anything?
[143:14.82]Look at that hand!
[143:44.18]What the fuck is going on?
[143:49.50]Who is this guy?
[143:51.42]Who is that guy?
[144:15.08]Why is it so dark?
[144:17.46]Something can be here.
[144:20.53]Get me the fuck out of here.
[144:21.51]Get me in my... I can't go in?
[144:36.21]Why is it not open?
[144:48.48]Is it on the floor?
[144:49.32]In the trash or something?
[144:52.72]Is the key hidden?
[144:57.00]Get to your apartment.
[144:58.66]Maybe there's another button I'm not... Hold on.
[145:03.35]I'm on the wrong floor.
[145:17.83]Finally, I'm home.
[145:20.85]I'm terribly hungry.
[145:21.90]I hope there's something to edible in the fridge.
[145:37.37]What is it?
[145:41.68]Great.
[145:42.40]That's lasagna.
[145:45.14]Needs to be heated in the microwave.
[145:48.34]One box of lasagna?
[145:50.62]Reheat lasagna.
[145:52.70]Is this your mind speaking?
[145:54.42]Reheat the lasagna in the microwave.
[146:03.01]And then watch at least six episodes of the Red Green Show before falling asleep with half of the lasagna on your chest.
[146:19.12]That's a wild couch.
[146:20.26]Look at how weird this couch is.
[146:22.42]I like it.
[146:22.76]Alright, where's the microwave?
[146:38.01]Okay, I've got an anime poster.
[146:39.88]Okay.
[147:02.79]Did I make it?
[147:05.89]Now I need to take a shower.
[147:11.92]Take a shower.
[147:21.80]That's more realistic.
[147:39.16]What's up?
[147:42.68]Hello?
[147:46.58]I'm your neighbor upstairs.
[147:50.86]Could you lend me some salt?
[147:56.45]I'm cooking something right now.
[147:58.45]And as luck would have it, I'm out of salt.
[148:03.03]Uh, okay.
[148:06.65]I'll bring it now.
[148:17.75]We got a new friend!
[148:18.95]Woo!
[148:20.67]I just moved in here.
[148:21.47]Maybe she even wants to watch the football game or something.
[148:25.70]Oh, I can't wait.
[148:28.44]Oh my goodness.
[148:29.06]We could probably talk about sports and talk about, I don't know, women and, and, and, and, um, he's not here.
[148:38.27]Where is he?
[148:47.71]Talk about women and men.
[148:48.95]Press tab, take a shower.
[148:57.03]Can I knock?
[148:57.55]Wait, I have to take a shower still.
[148:58.89]Should I take a shower with the salt?
[149:07.64]Hey, you know, there are shitload of women on this channel.
[149:09.96]I lied, but we talked about demographics.
[149:11.96]Like 30% of this whole, 40% of the whole audience is women.
[149:21.28]Hey, shout out to the girlies, okay?
[149:23.30]Shout out to the girlies tonight.
[149:39.83]Now that's all that's up.
[149:40.55]Take all the trash and I can go to bed.
[149:41.63]Didn't I have to give salt to this guy?
[149:52.78]Dude, I got a great- Okay.
[149:54.82]Uh, I want 7% of the money from this.
[149:57.06]Um, so a game like this, where you walk around, you do a bunch of shit, and you have a neighbor upstairs.
[150:02.22]And... At some point, the big jump scare.
[150:04.98]I want 7% of this.
[150:05.76]No, I want 15% of this.
[150:06.94]Fuck that.
[150:07.30]This is- this is a great one.
[150:09.14]And during the game, you know, there's a- there's a scary guy, there's creepy shit going on.
[150:12.25]Um, and you do a couple of- a couple of days.
[150:14.97]This is like a 20 minute experience.
[150:16.91]Like, two days in a row.
[150:18.73]Where...
[150:20.50]It's like nothing really happens, but you kind of start hearing stuff.
[150:23.34]You have the neighbor shows up and starts asking you questions, but the culmination is he literally falls through the fucking ceiling in his bathtub.
[150:30.31]Like, oh my god!
[150:31.49]Like, he breaks through the ceiling in the bathtub and screaming and stuff, and that's the huge jump scare.
[150:39.24]Like, you kind of hear stuff upstairs.
[150:40.72]You're like, what is going on?
[150:43.74]You hear like...
[150:47.15]weird like singing and stuff and you're like there's something creepy going on up there but it actually was just a guy that gets home and takes a bath and sings and shower and stuff and he falls through the ceiling that's pretty good yeah I I want actually that's a 30 deal right there I think that's like a 33 that's the whole game so that's like a 35 at least
[151:18.98]Where's the trash?
[151:37.70]Where do I take the trash down here?
[151:45.31]Why am I trying to take other people's trash?
[151:48.15]That's a Family Guy bit, dude.
[151:52.99]So what?
[151:53.61]What are you so pe- What, Peter Griffin falls through the ceiling with a- Give me 15- Give me 15% of this Family Guy bit as a game.
[152:17.82]No, you don't get it.
[152:18.56]You don't get it.
[152:19.12]I would make it so different.
[152:20.48]It's the vision.
[152:21.08]You need to see the vision.
[152:23.88]If you saw my vision, you'd get it.
[152:25.68]Yeah, I need to get a good fucking game director and you would see the vision.
[152:28.14]Okay, there's the trash.
[152:51.15]Turn home, alright?
[153:13.94]Here's the trick.
[153:14.58]Chat's the only people that's gonna buy that game, so he's really just tricking people into getting him money.
[153:20.66]But just tapping into the community to just buy a game that you would never have bought anyways?
[153:26.24]I don't... No.
[153:27.46]No, it's... You haven't seen the vision.
[153:48.33]Okay, I can finally go to bed.
[153:50.75]I didn't bring the salt.
[153:53.19]I have the salt in my inventory still and I picked it up and I still have it.
[154:16.56]I did it already.
[154:17.46]I did that already.
[154:19.48]I need to give myself 7%.
[154:21.98]That's alright.
[154:23.26]Oh my god, oh my god!
[154:24.56]It's gonna be the salt guy.
[154:38.92]Alright, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[154:41.70]Who is it?
[154:45.72]The neighbor again with his salt?
[154:52.41]Check the front door.
[154:59.51]Some traces?
[155:06.11]And they lead to the fifth floor.
[155:07.83]Oh, great.
[155:11.79]What is my mile on?
[155:12.69]Hold on a minute.
[155:16.10]Check the fifth floor.
[155:17.80]You got it, mind.
[155:30.11]blood leading to the apartment alright do I knock bro what are you doing in here
[156:03.86]He's gonna be cooking and eating people.
[156:08.24]That's probably the symbol for, like, I... That's probably the symbol for, hey, I cook and eat people and want to cryptically tell people I do.
[156:14.90]Right?
[156:15.18]It's something like that.
[156:16.04]It's like a culter.
[156:16.76]I need a key?
[156:30.53]How come you know that?
[156:33.82]It's a guess based on the fact that there's a bunch of cultist shit in here, and the guy asked for salt, and there's a bunch of meat everywhere, and there's a bunch of potatoes and apples and cranberries and stuff, and he's like, oh, I need salt, and I cook and eat people.
[156:45.81]And here's a bunch of symbols about eating people.
[156:59.48]God, what is it?
[157:08.38]fuck oh my god he's a fucking killer he wanted to salt the corpses I need to call the cops in fast what do I do uh go to my apartment
[157:37.33]Do I take- do I do anything?
[157:38.33]Oh my god, this is actually fucked up.
[157:39.69]I gotta get out of here.
[157:40.39]This is fucking creepy.
[157:48.30]The FOV got higher too.
[157:49.50]That's a good- I like- that's an interesting touch.
[157:51.34]Do I have a phone?
[157:55.14]Where's my phone?
[157:55.56]Do I have a phone?
[158:12.39]I need to calm down.
[158:13.05]Always turn the power off.
[158:40.63]Leave.
[159:01.28]I knew it, too, and it's still there.
[159:18.26]I knew it.
[159:19.10]I knew it.
[159:19.62]Okay.
[159:26.09]That was good.
[159:27.23]That was atmospheric.
[159:28.66]Really creepy model, too.
[159:32.00]Ugh.
[159:34.86]Very good.
[159:35.78]That was salt?
[159:39.46]Okay, when it says leave, I'm imagining that the actual scare is going to happen somewhere downstairs.
[159:50.37]Okay.
[159:50.61]Okay.
[159:52.95]Uh, this one's called, should we do, this one's called kiosk.
[159:56.70]I feel like this one's going to be a short one.
[160:08.57]Kiosk.
[160:10.25]Kiosk is a long one.
[160:11.47]Kiosk is 10 hours long.
[160:12.99]Holy shit.
[160:14.81]Is it really?
[160:17.32]Maybe should I start it?
[160:20.81]There's also coffee at night.
[160:23.57]That's a 12-hour stream.
[160:27.17]It's good, though.
[160:27.75]Okay.
[160:29.92]It's like an hour.
[160:30.76]It's literally 46 hours.
[160:32.44]What?
[160:33.26]Wow.
[160:38.58]Let me open it.
[160:39.22]Let me take a look at it.
[160:40.93]We don't have to stay the whole time, but I could come back to it another day.
[160:51.74]Are you saying this one's long?
[160:52.84]Alright.
[160:54.78]I'm willing to check it out.

[172:34.81]What happened to the last guy?
[172:36.49]You don't know?
[172:37.25]He was my friend.
[172:39.71]They say he went crazy.
[172:40.73]Started seeing things.
[172:42.99]Last time I saw him, I could really see the fear in his eyes.
[172:46.71]Huh.
[172:48.45]Anyways.
[172:51.38]Gotta go.
[172:59.95]Close the button.
[173:22.28]My wife just left me and I need something to kill the pain.
[173:25.51]Give me five beers.
[173:27.49]Cold ones.
[173:31.61]Oh, this is open.
[173:32.27]Does that matter?
[173:32.73]Oops.
[173:52.71]Okay, thanks.
[173:54.09]See you around.
[174:00.67]What is that?
[174:02.13]Shut up!
[174:06.47]Jeez.
[174:17.92]This guy didn't pay last time.
[174:21.06]Uh, a hot dog and a cold beer.
[174:22.54]Hey, it's you.
[174:24.25]Uh, last time you ran off and didn't pay.
[174:27.93]I won't serve you again unless you pay.
[174:30.41]Did you just refuse to serve your master?
[174:33.87]You made a huge mistake.
[174:35.50]You will pay for this.
[174:36.22]Oh yeah.
[174:47.15]You know, I got hot oil over here too.
[174:56.12]Welcome to the Hot Dog Shack!
[174:57.20]How can I help you?
[175:00.10]You know that crocodiles can't stick their tongues out.
[175:02.28]They also can't chew.
[175:04.16]They eat rocks to help them digest.
[175:05.96]Can I get two burgers?
[175:10.82]Uh... Lettuce, ketchup, mustard.
[175:13.84]Lettuce, ketchup, mustard, cheese, lettuce... Don't say it like that!
[175:19.55]You want one with... I forgot the first one.
[175:21.47]One with lettuce, ketchup... They want... It's the same order!
[175:26.27]You want two with lettuce, ketchup, mustard, and one with... Lettuce, ketchup, mustard, and one with, okay, cheese, lettuce, ketchup.
[175:37.58]Lettuce, ketchup, cheese, lettuce, lettuce, ketchup, mustard, cheese, lettuce, ketchup.
[175:48.20]Bingo, look at that.
[175:49.58]Hey, just like they do at, um... What the fuck is a restaurant?
[175:53.66]They have... You put the sauce packet on the bottom.
[175:55.91]That means two eggs.
[175:57.09]Then you put the... On the left side of the plate, you put down a salt packet.
[176:01.11]And that means it's over medium.
[176:02.93]Who does that?
[176:03.59]Waffle House.
[176:04.07]Yep.
[176:04.55]The Waffle House way.
[176:07.11]And then you put the... A piece of silverware.
[176:09.13]You put the fork and you turn it upside down and you put it on the top of the plate.
[176:11.81]That means they want hash browns.
[176:15.83]I love that.
[176:16.31]Alright.
[176:18.57]Yeah, they have a system at Waffle House that's like that.
[176:22.97]Nice YouTube short, Andy.
[176:25.05]You watched it too.
[176:26.09]That's why you know that.
[176:27.43]So we're both YouTube short assholes.
[176:29.55]And we both brought it our fucking brains with that thing.
[176:32.01]Alright?
[176:32.67]The only difference is for every one reel that I watch, I have to let the sun hit me in the face for one minute.
[176:42.76]Hold on, sir.
[176:47.29]What did you want?
[176:47.75]Alright, he wants two burgers.
[176:57.63]Lettuce?
[177:01.35]I think the patty has to be on there first.
[177:04.69]Hold on.
[177:05.49]Almost ready.
[177:12.54]What even was that?
[177:13.34]I didn't get scared of nothing.
[177:14.20]There's nothing even here.
[177:14.84]There's a guy here.
[177:15.44]What?
[177:35.66]Okay, whatever.
[177:36.68]Hope you like one side of your burger at 160 degrees and the rest at 30.
[177:47.02]Lettuce, cheese, ketchup.
[177:50.05]Oink.
[177:51.75]There's one.
[177:54.15]What are you talking about?
[177:55.23]What do you mean?
[177:56.37]What?
[177:57.67]Lettuce, ketchup, mustard with cheese, lettuce, ketchup.
[178:01.05]This guy's full of shit.
[178:05.59]Cheese, lettuce, ketchup is what I just did.
[178:07.26]This guy's full of shit.
[178:07.96]You have to do it in that order?
[178:11.79]What kind of a weirdo orders like that and is mad that you got one before the other?
[178:16.37]Wrong order.
[178:24.32]I would tell this guy to leave.
[178:25.66]I'd be like, dude, you get the fuck out of here.
[178:28.52]Don't come back.
[178:29.86]And by the way, I'm ready for when you leave the Yelp review saying, oh, you know, I was treated very poorly by the staff.
[178:38.34]And I get to go in and say, hey, this is a fucking weird guy.
[178:40.56]He ordered two hamburgers and he got pissed off because I gave him one of the burgers before the other one.
[178:46.94]They were correct orders.
[178:47.78]The guy's just a weird guy.
[178:49.31]Don't take this review seriously.
[178:51.27]Owner of Burger Shack 6
[178:56.43]And I got a 5.0 rating, by the way.
[178:57.93]F*** you, okay?
[178:58.69]Alright, let's go.
[179:04.63]What's the first one?
[179:06.75]Lettuce, ketchup, and mustard.

[179:13.06]Lettuce, ketchup, and mustard.
[179:17.94]Give me a patty.
[179:23.00]Lettuce.
[179:24.44]Ketchup.
[179:25.24]Wait, is that correct?
[179:27.14]Lettuce, ketchup, and mustard.
[179:28.12]I just thought... This guy's a... He's freaking me out.
[179:34.33]There you go.
[179:34.77]Here's your first one.
[179:36.67]And now you want... What's the second one?
[179:38.41]Cheese.
[179:40.39]Cheese, lettuce, and ketchup.
[179:43.47]Now I have to make a whole... You're gonna make me open another packet?
[179:47.75]I have to open another packet for this guy.
[180:15.33]Oops, it was in the trash.
[180:17.93]Oops, I can't get it out.
[180:24.18]What do you want?
[180:24.82]Cheese, lettuce and... What was the second order?
[180:30.12]Cheese, lettuce and ketchup.
[180:31.20]You got it.
[180:43.25]Thanks.
[180:44.03]Smells like a good burger.
[180:46.47]Yeah.
[180:48.40]Man.
[181:05.04]What's happening?
[181:06.66]Beer and hot dog with mustard and ketchup, please.
[181:09.24]I love the easy customers.
[181:10.72]You want a beer and you want a hot dog with ketchup and mustard.
[181:14.38]I almost want to give this to you for free to make sure you keep coming back because you are so easy.
[181:30.76]I'm going to make sure I treat this customer very well.
[181:41.98]None of those hit the floor and you're not getting a floor hot dog.
[181:44.54]Not you.
[182:00.21]Perfect.
[182:01.15]You want to test?
[182:01.65]You want to smell?
[182:02.63]Smell it?
[182:03.39]Okay.
[182:04.09]Perfectly cooked.
[182:07.43]Going right into the bun.
[182:08.37]In view.
[182:09.10]In view.
[182:10.92]And I just want to double check the order to make sure I get it right.
[182:13.74]You wanted a beer and a hot dog with mustard and ketchup.
[182:15.99]You got it.
[182:21.01]Here's the dog.
[182:22.92]And here's the fresh ice cold beer.
[182:24.90]I got it from the back of the fridge where it's the coldest.
[182:26.82]So here you go.
[182:29.82]Thank you.
[182:30.82]Hear about the guy that died in a car crash yesterday.
[182:32.80]Damn, no.
[182:34.68]I heard his wife left him for another dude.
[182:36.96]Police found him out.
[182:37.64]They found alcohol in his blood.
[182:40.05]On drink and drive, I guess.
[182:41.39]Take care.
[182:41.71]That's good advice.
[182:44.67]Damn.
[182:55.21]I like this game.
[182:55.81]I think I'm going to stay on this one.
[183:03.37]I'll take that order in just one second.
[183:05.71]I, uh, I'm gonna take a break.
[183:08.17]I'm just pulling down, like, the thing.
[183:09.77]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[183:11.84]Taking an ad break.
[183:13.96]Imagine I just showed her fucking three minutes of ads.
[183:24.50]Yeah, I'll be right back.
[183:25.42]Alright, I'm getting up.

[187:27.60]Alright.
[187:27.98]The ad break is over.
[187:28.84]And I have done some squatting.
[187:34.82]Stretch the legs a little.
[187:36.70]Here we go.
[187:41.74]I appreciate you watching all those ads.
[187:43.98]So what can I get you?
[187:46.02]One coffee, please.
[187:47.10]I have to study all night.

[187:52.07]I'll give it to you.
[188:06.18]I want one of those right now.
[188:07.28]That was fast.
[188:13.73]Thank you so much.
[188:15.39]I've heard some strange stories about this place.
[188:16.95]Are they true?
[188:17.97]Do you also see them?
[188:20.32]See who?
[188:21.50]Never mind.
[188:21.96]I have to go.
[188:23.58]It's getting late.
[188:24.74]Keep the change.
[188:27.48]If you're wondering why I keep going like this.
[188:30.04]Just because the game is open on the other monitor and the other monitors up like over here.
[188:35.48]It's like above this one, so it's like.
[188:39.46]This was kind of blocking.
[188:40.40]I got a really weird setup, but it's it is what it is.
[188:48.60]One burger with cheese and a cold beer.
[188:50.04]Perfect.
[189:01.38]I might have cheese.
[189:02.04]I think I need cheese.
[189:23.84]There you go.
[189:25.42]It's overcooked.
[189:26.72]No, it's not.
[189:42.11]That's like when Gordon Ramsay goes in Kitchen Nightmares and the food is disgusting and the chef goes, well, that's how people like it.
[189:49.09]People have ordered it like that for 20 years.
[189:52.94]It's overcooked.
[189:54.56]No, it's not.
[189:56.72]Yes, it is.
[189:57.22]No, it isn't.
[189:58.54]That's how people like it.
[190:05.68]No one's ever complained.
[190:07.11]We've been open for 15 years.
[190:08.97]No one's ever complained.
[190:09.97]And now they're about to.
[190:12.79]Thanks.
[190:13.29]Here you go.
[190:15.63]Stay safe.
[190:32.30]Hey, what weapon are you choosing?
[190:35.95]You gonna go up there with a raw hot dog and just fucking throw it at him?
[190:40.00]You gonna go up there with a knife or you gonna go up there with a patty?
[190:53.73]Get away from me!
[190:56.59]Hey!
[190:56.67]Get away from me!
[190:57.08]Get away from me!
[191:14.55]I want to hear a joke about pizza.
[191:15.84]Never mind, it's too cheesy.
[191:22.70]Oh, man.
[191:32.79]Oh, man.
[191:34.67]A hot dog with ketchup.
[191:36.60]Give me a coffee and a hot dog with ketchup.
[191:38.16]Alright, you got it.
[191:55.59]I love staying in hotels because I just get one of these every morning and I'm good.
[191:58.53]I love that hotel coffee.
[192:08.25]Hotel coffee is how you really get your day started.
[192:10.62]I love that continental breakfast.
[192:13.94]I love that orange juice machine.
[192:16.02]You know the one.
[192:18.32]I could talk about it for hours.
[192:21.66]The only way I want orange juice from a hotel is if I press the button on this machine that was from, like, 1999.
[192:28.19]And it makes a sound effect and, like, gross orange liquid comes out.
[192:34.77]The only kind of hotel orange juice I want.
[192:40.59]Shut up.
[192:41.49]Put the hot dog in the bun.
[192:44.51]What did you want, ketchup?
[192:55.23]How much money am I making here?
[192:57.69]What you thought on the toast machine?
[192:58.79]Oh, I love it.
[193:04.83]And you go over to where the yogurt is and it's not even refrigerated.
[193:09.47]For some reason, the yogurt, there's no fridge.
[193:11.78]It's just sitting in a bunch of ice like a cooler.
[193:17.10]That's the only way I've ever seen yogurt presented that way.
[193:21.74]It's just sitting in ice like a bunch of beers.
[193:27.43]Okay, I see you're still here.
[193:28.87]You must really like this job.
[193:29.97]I hope it pays well.
[193:33.11]Soda and a burger with everything.
[193:36.19]Let me get the soda out of the way.
[193:37.13]And then you want a burger with everything.
[193:42.16]What is everything?
[193:43.90]Lettuce?
[193:46.04]Lettuce, ketchup, mustard, cheese, and a hot dog on it?
[193:49.02]That's everything.
[193:50.98]Customer was not specific enough.
[193:56.43]Yeah, and put a beer on it too.
[194:00.81]And a coffee on it.
[194:02.49]Man, it just doesn't make me want to eat like hot dogs.
[194:10.46]I think a cheeseburger is one of those things that's one of those craving foods that there's no getting over that craving until you get it.
[194:16.82]I just destroyed the ketchup and mustard.
[194:21.14]Did I just do a collateral on the ketchup and the mustard?
[194:27.94]Where do I get more?
[194:28.54]In the closet?
[194:36.77]Oh, okay, good.
[194:45.70]Catch up.
[194:57.19]I need cheese.
[194:57.95]Where'd that mustard go?
[194:58.79]I just threw it over here and I don't even know where it went.
[195:01.90]God, come on.
[195:09.46]And then lettuce.
[195:10.20]Now I need cheese.
[195:19.90]That's it, right?
[195:20.56]Lettuce.
[195:21.30]Lettuce.
[195:22.28]Nothing else, right?
[195:23.72]Okay.
[195:25.19]I don't know if I'm paranoid or I watch too many scary movies, but I have a feeling like somebody's following me around.
[195:29.14]A lot of creepy people around here.
[195:31.06]Be careful.
[195:32.98]Be careful, too.
[195:33.50]Why don't you take one of these knives with you?
[195:36.98]Hey, I've got a knife with every burger.
[195:41.70]Hello?
[195:42.63]I see you.
[195:43.87]Who is this?
[195:45.47]Why are you calling?
[195:46.87]Sleep with your eyes open.
[195:57.00]Fucking sledgehammer next to my bed.
[196:03.91]Sleep right next to the fucking sledgehammer.
[196:08.91]Hey man, can I get two cups of coffee and one hot dog with lettuce and mustard?
[196:12.93]Hot dog, lettuce, mustard.
[196:35.71]Okay, two coffees first because they have to do that correctly, right?
[196:39.67]I need more coffee things.
[196:53.20]Nice.
[196:54.14]Good shot.
[196:58.17]Sludge hammer sounds like a music genre.
[197:06.30]One coffee.
[197:10.51]Two coffees.
[197:22.00]You know that butterflies drink blood if there is an option.
[197:27.96]I always found them creepy.
[197:30.76]Here you go.
[197:34.71]Uh, isn't a hamburger effectively just like a bunch of blood and muscle tissue?
[197:41.98]Don't do this again.
[197:42.66]I'm just going.
[197:43.06]Fuck the jumpscare.
[197:43.97]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[197:44.87]Out of here.
[197:45.21]Go, go.
[197:46.29]You didn't have time to even do it.
[197:47.97]Gone.
[197:48.77]Hey!
[198:08.22]His stabbing reflex kicked in.
[198:11.66]Oh my God, a jump scare.
[198:20.34]Two hot dogs with lettuce and mustard, OK.
[198:24.54]Two hot dogs with lettuce and mustard.
[198:45.06]I had a lettuce.
[198:47.34]Oh, no, this piece.
[198:49.46]Is there two pieces?
[198:50.10]Okay, lettuce and mustard on both?
[198:51.38]Is that what you said?
[198:52.65]Please be more specific.
[198:54.61]Stupid.
[198:56.59]Lettuce and mustard.
[199:01.89]Am I out of buns?
[199:03.38]Yep.
[199:17.17]I'm just gonna store them over here.
[199:18.21]Okay.
[199:38.03]That's so fucked up.
[199:43.01]Uh, you wanted two of them.
[199:48.64]Oh, lettuce and mustard, right?
[199:50.60]Is one.
[199:50.88]And another hot dog.
[200:06.21]Don't tell Gordon Ramsay.
[200:08.65]Don't do it.
[200:10.33]Don't.
[200:13.51]He's going to see this on the floor and he's going to freak out.
[200:23.64]Cook a bunch of hot dogs ahead of time.
[200:24.92]I was thinking about doing that.
[200:25.77]I didn't know if you couldn't do it.
[200:28.23]Police found his body, by the way.
[200:29.97]Guy that worked here.
[200:31.47]My friend.
[200:32.01]Because he was stabbed.
[200:33.61]Report says he was stabbed over 50 times.
[200:37.23]His body was in some bushes near the park, not far away from here.
[200:43.54]He was left to rot in this rain.
[200:48.04]He didn't deserve what happened to him.
[200:49.84]No one does.
[200:51.85]Keep the change and stay safe.
[200:58.27]The heck?
[201:01.01]Okay, yeah, that's a good idea.
[201:01.90]Let's try this.
[201:02.56]Let's pre-cook like a hundred of these.
[201:12.47]Just one second.
[201:13.03]I'll be with you just very, very shortly.
[201:14.87]Give me one minute.
[201:55.84]That one cooked instantly.
[201:56.86]Okay.
[202:33.63]What do you want?
[202:34.75]What did you ask for?
[202:36.73]Oh my god.
[202:38.27]You've seen them too, don't you?
[202:39.62]What are you talking about?
[202:41.02]I can see them.
[202:41.78]I can see the fear in your face.
[202:43.88]You should quit this job.
[202:44.82]It's not worth it.
[202:45.90]Give me a beer.
[202:47.28]Maybe you should get one too.
[203:00.80]Thanks.
[203:01.98]And remember, you're not alone in this.
[203:06.11]I also see them sometimes.
[203:08.65]Stay safe.
[203:30.41]What's that?
[203:33.64]Okay, I have another good one for you.
[203:35.34]Why did the hot dog marry his wife?
[203:38.37]Because she had great buns.
[203:40.87]Just give me a beer and a burger with cheese.
[204:04.17]Oh, my buns are over here.
[204:14.83]Thanks.
[204:18.60]Favorite hot dog brand.
[204:21.10]What's it called?
[204:21.90]I think was Applegate.
[204:23.30]Something like that, right?
[204:26.54]Those are pretty good.
[204:28.64]Here comes another jumpscare.
[204:29.52]Be ready.
[204:45.04]A present?
[204:46.50]Uh, what's gonna be in here?
[204:47.42]It's gonna be a head.
[204:48.08]Was it a bomb?
[204:59.01]Wait, did somebody just give- deliver me a fucking bomb?
[205:03.53]What?
[205:07.79]I did not expect that somebody was going to give me a bomb for a package.
[205:12.35]I thought there was going to be a scary guy.
[205:26.42]Alright, well, was that one?
[205:27.91]Okay, that was crazy.
[205:29.13]I like that one a lot.
[205:29.83]That was a good one.
[205:41.22]I forgot that's how this ends.
[205:42.78]Yeah, I did not expect, um... Bomb.
[205:52.74]I expected jump scare by monster.
[205:55.22]You know what?
[205:55.76]That's a... That's the bathtub falling through.
[206:00.20]That's not jump scare going into your face, right?
[206:03.52]Into your face.
[206:04.84]That's just, hey, somebody... I guess somebody dropped a bomb off.
[206:09.42]Like...
[206:15.98]The guy that you refused to serve.
[206:17.84]What?
[206:18.38]Oh, I guess so.
[206:20.18]So was that just the ghost of the guy that was killed or something?
[206:26.92]Too much PTSD from Devil May Cry.
[206:28.76]Yeah.
[206:31.21]Alright, let's do another one.
[206:32.21]That was a good one, though.
[206:35.91]I liked that one.
[206:39.07]What if you throw the gift out the window?
[206:40.35]I don't think there was an option.
[206:41.53]I think it was just open.
[206:48.29]This is not the full version of the game, really.
[206:57.65]That's pretty cool.
[206:58.23]So what is it?
[206:58.83]This is just like the Ichio one?
[207:03.51]I liked it though.
[207:04.95]That was a wild ending.
[207:05.97]That was a wild game.
[207:07.25]I mean, any game where you could cook food is kind of fun.
[207:10.55]It's good.
[207:13.43]Okay.
[207:14.17]This next one is called
[207:21.30]I want to try this one.
[207:22.62]This one's called, uh, green grass, green grass awaits.
[207:28.54]I'm curious about this one.
[207:34.55]This one's good.
[207:35.17]This is great.
[207:36.15]Okay.
[207:36.41]Let's just go to try.
[207:37.57]How long is this one?
[207:44.07]Is this one like, uh, an hour, 40 minutes, 20 minutes.
[207:48.69]It's it's medium.
[207:49.31]Okay.
[207:52.81]Greener grass awaits.
[207:53.95]Yeah, that's right.
[208:03.19]Oh, there it is.
[208:12.83]On this other screen, some of them open up on this one and some of them open up on the other one.
[208:18.47]Interesting how that works out.
[208:21.13]How's the hair?
[208:22.74]Wait, is it a little wild?
[208:24.94]How do we look?
[208:29.12]Hey, get, get, get your screenshots because this is for that.
[208:31.42]We're not doing this facecam for like another fucking six months.
[208:46.35]Greener grass awaits.
[208:54.16]It's not the right resolution.
[208:55.30]There we go.
[208:58.38]Okay.
[209:00.64]Is the audio good?
[209:01.41]You look like Lord Farquaad's cousin.
[209:21.12]That's fine.
[209:30.89]Okay, here we go.
[209:32.51]Uh, begin.
[209:34.05]Levels.
[209:35.67]Uh, begin?
[209:38.25]Choose a body.
[209:42.71]Golf is loading.
[209:43.93]WASD to move.
[209:44.58]Mouse to look.
[209:45.14]Press E to interact when hand icon is visible.
[209:47.64]Okay.
[209:50.86]Enter the club.
[209:56.52]Oh, uh, let's get the mouse sensitivity down.
[210:01.43]Um, well, apparently there are enemies in this golf game.
[210:03.72]Well, I mean, you could have, could have guessed.
[210:22.89]play mouthwashing isn't mouthwashing a 20 to 30 hour game I feel like I'd that's not a that's not an itch.io grab bag night that's that would be like an entire stream no it's like three oh I don't know no don't
[210:50.28]I got no plans, but... One to two hours, depending.
[210:56.08]Alright, let's do it.
[210:56.56]Golf club.
[211:00.66]Try again.
[211:02.56]Find somewhere to jump the fence.
[211:15.90]Why is your webcam so out of focus?
[211:17.20]I don't know, because this thing's a piece of shit.
[211:46.88]I think it's because it's dark.
[211:59.07]What the fuck?
[212:00.36]I golf in my dreams.
[212:11.17]It's a clever way to put an invisible wall up.
[212:13.30]It's because your webcam is too far away and you have to crop a ton of it to get it where it is.
[212:19.49]Yeah, but then it's like HD and I want you guys to... I don't want to have an HD face.
[212:47.42]Oh my goodness.
[212:52.56]You want more of a resolution?
[212:55.58]Is the ball slowly rolling down a hill?
[212:56.90]Place a bag in front of it to bring it to a halt.
[213:05.90]Fullscreen the cam.
[213:13.84]What's wrong with this?
[213:16.35]It's a little blurry, but whatever, but it's higher resolution like this.
[213:21.92]What's wrong with this?
[213:29.52]That's better.
[213:35.23]Look, look how much higher crisper it is.
[213:37.97]That's like crispy now.
[213:54.57]Alright, here we go.
[213:56.07]All one.
[213:57.37]Welcome to the beginning of the Green Canyon Golf Course.
[214:00.64]Hope you enjoy the experience.
[214:01.56]Please remember no golf carts are allowed due to the sensitive environment.

[214:13.63]Press R to drop bag.
[214:14.65]E to select appropriate club.
[214:16.15]Okay, so bag, club.
[214:19.15]Press E to place ball on tee.
[214:20.91]Press E on ball to enter golf mode.
[214:24.74]A and D rotate around the ball.
[214:25.88]Press shift to go fast, control to go slow.
[214:29.27]Right click to see guide and adjust trajectory for the driver club.
[214:33.27]Wait, I thought this was mini golf.
[214:35.23]It's not mini golf?
[214:38.37]Click and drag with the left mouse button to swing.
[214:41.19]Speed matters.
[214:44.77]So you have to wound two.
[214:46.85]Press E to leave golf mode and retrieve your bag with R. Don't forget it.
[215:11.23]Oh, where are my clubs?
[215:17.15]Where are my clubs?
[215:20.81]Press R. I'm pressing... I pressed R. You forgot them in the car?
[215:28.20]No, I did not.
[215:34.36]Just throw the ball.
[215:38.12]I'm pressing R. R doesn't do anything.
[215:42.55]You forgot the clubs in the car?
[215:44.07]If they're in the car, I'm gonna be fucking... Where are my clubs?
[215:50.58]Look down at the ground.
[215:56.92]I didn't forget how to do it immediately.
[215:58.88]Alright, let's get it.
[216:04.77]Uh, what kind of... That's a putter.
[216:07.67]Alright, let's do it.
[216:08.29]Here we go.
[216:21.21]I don't even know where that went.
[216:37.67]Am I doing this right?
[216:39.13]Oh, shit!
[216:40.47]Okay, it's right... Okay, I was going ba- Oh, that's bad.
[216:44.33]I need to restart the game.
[216:47.71]I was going up and down.
[216:48.81]You have to go right and left.
[216:52.99]Alright, let's chip it in there nice and easy.
[217:00.65]I get it now.
[217:01.29]Okay.
[217:04.09]I went like this.
[217:08.19]My clubs!
[217:08.85]Dude, I'm not playing with a Wii mode.
[217:29.76]Give me the putter.
[217:30.28]Alright, let's get this right.
[217:47.30]Dude, I don't know how hard.
[217:54.36]This is the first hole.
[217:55.82]Hold right click.
[218:01.67]Oh, right.
[218:02.59]Yeah, I did forget that part.
[218:03.71]You're right.
[218:05.69]Yeah, you're right.
[218:06.21]That's fine.
[218:08.43]That's alright.
[218:08.99]I just have to restart everything.
[218:10.73]I'm good.
[218:18.00]Alright, hole two.
[218:20.92]You ever played golf IRL?
[218:22.62]Yeah, I suck absolute ass at it.
[218:30.26]I'll get better, just wait.
[218:32.20]Okay, this one is that way.
[218:34.04]We're going to skip that.
[218:34.88]I'm going to hit it as hard as I can that way.
[218:36.74]Par three, I'll do it in two hits.
[218:45.47]I forgot this was a horror game until one second ago.
[218:47.65]Alright, let's get that driver out.
[218:57.59]Right there.
[219:06.10]That's as far as this is gonna go?
[219:08.00]Uh... Just plow it?
[219:20.92]Hold on.
[219:28.45]Ooh, good hit.
[220:03.56]That's not bad.
[220:21.45]right there alright do another one perfect that's not bad that is uh how far away is that I don't think that's alright
[220:56.91]Alright, let's sink it right here.
[220:57.85]I'm going to use... Oh, shit.
[221:03.52]Should I put it from the fucking grass?
[221:10.32]It's all in the rough.
[221:11.16]I think I still get it in.
[221:11.90]I just have to smash it, I think.
[221:33.59]Oh, what?
[221:35.69]That would have been so sick.
[221:36.75]I can't believe that didn't go in.
[221:48.14]I can't believe it.
[221:59.12]I fucking hate this.
[222:00.06]I hate golf.
[222:01.56]Golf is the most... It's the worst sport in the whole world.
[222:13.31]And you know what?
[222:13.87]It angers me so much because I think golf is one of the hardest things to do.
[222:20.41]Golf is one of the hardest things in the world to do.
[222:23.21]Being good at golf, I respect it.
[222:25.75]But I don't like it.
[222:28.16]But I actually like this.
[222:29.68]Because it's fun.
[222:34.79]Oh my god.
[222:42.73]I don't know how hard to hit it.
[222:49.04]You're getting negative elo right now?
[222:50.82]Well, put me back into fucking chicken league, alright?
[222:53.22]Put me back into wood 2.
[222:58.72]This is the first golf game I've played since Wii Golf, and that was in 2010.
[223:01.38]Finally.
[223:01.62]Jeez.
[223:29.68]Part 4.
[223:30.60]Do our trees seem unique?
[223:31.80]We've imported saplings from Europe in order to give Green Canyon a distinct look.
[223:35.32]Very cool.
[223:37.74]You're doing great, babe.
[223:39.00]Don't let them neg you.
[223:40.26]Alright, this is part 4.
[223:48.01]I'm going to try to skip everything.
[223:49.69]Just hit it straight over this tree.
[224:12.11]And I'm going to crush this ball.
[224:13.79]I'm gonna hit as hard as I can.
[224:15.14]I need to go over the tree.
[224:23.27]Like that.
[224:23.95]Will it hit the tree?
[224:24.67]Or will it just go through the leaves?
[224:28.75]Dude, behind you?
[224:30.67]What?
[224:44.58]It's still good.
[224:46.16]It's still fine.
[224:46.63]Okay, where's the hole?
[224:58.26]Is it part four?
[224:58.98]Alright, I can just smash it straight over there, I think.
[225:03.48]How hard do I need to hit it?
[225:04.62]All the way?
[225:05.00]Let me get a birdie here.
[225:17.57]Now you guys are freaking me out because you're saying there's somebody here.
[225:24.96]Line drive right there.
[225:37.89]Nice.
[225:38.35]Alright.
[225:38.91]I got a chance here to actually redeem myself.
[225:52.02]Alright, come on.
[225:53.02]Give me a birdie.
[225:54.86]Don't screw it up.
[225:55.82]Line it up.
[225:59.37]Butter, let's go.
[226:00.17]Alright, what are we thinking?
[226:13.65]Right there?
[226:14.07]Right there.
[226:16.71]I got to hit it pretty hard.
[226:18.61]Should I smash it?
[226:24.02]Oh my God, it hits so much harder.
[226:26.04]I didn't, that hits so hard.
[226:29.38]The putter versus the driver is so different.
[226:36.50]I was so far away.
[226:37.67]I thought the indicator was like the end of that is like a super hit.
[226:56.79]Sink it, you fucking idiot.
[227:01.30]Nothing rages me more than putting.
[227:04.08]It's the most patient shit fucking game in existence.
[227:08.07]I can't believe I just didn't get it right there.
[227:32.10]Did I count?
[227:38.54]They gave me did I get double bad score?
[227:40.75]Hey, the course is closed.
[227:52.71]I didn't know.
[227:53.21]Well it is so you should get going.
[228:01.35]I know I'm getting out of here.
[228:03.96]Don't break anything.
[228:30.11]This guy's a monster.
[228:31.01]He's going to jump at me or something, right?
[228:41.78]Control and shift to slow down or speed up turning around the ball.
[228:45.20]Wait one.
[228:54.53]Now the game just got a little scarier.
[228:55.95]It's fine.
[229:02.16]Now I'm going to have to golf with something screaming at me and stuff.
[229:05.04]I'm so bad at golf games and golf in general.
[229:09.93]This is going to be a disaster.
[229:17.10]Watch out for the middle of this course as the land slopes into the water.
[229:19.94]More golf balls can be purchased at the clubhouse.
[229:28.23]What about Mario Golf?
[229:29.15]Yeah, Mario Golf is good because Mario Golf has, you can put your ball down and then add like +2 leafs to it and the ball will fly.
[229:38.25]You hit the ball and it gets wings and flies for 10 seconds.
[229:41.44]You land it and then it's not the same.
[229:43.52]It's not golf.
[229:45.00]It's like fun golf.
[230:05.36]I don't hit the bag, do I?
[230:06.76]What the hell was that?
[230:25.49]Alright, be careful.
[230:27.58]Where is the actual hole?
[230:33.02]Alright, so I can't.
[230:34.74]I gotta be careful.
[230:40.05]What is that though?
[230:40.73]They're actually something yelling at me.
[230:48.75]I gotta get a tight, tight, tight right there.
[230:51.67]I just I don't want to hit the wall.
[230:56.00]I think that's good.
[230:56.54]A little bit higher.
[231:01.00]Don't go in the water.
[231:05.82]I think I'm good.
[231:06.24]Alright, get this on the green.
[231:29.43]Just a nice wave sound, it's fine.
[231:36.38]I don't smash this.
[231:39.85]Just a little follow through with it.
[231:46.02]That's pretty good.
[231:48.16]There's no way.
[231:48.88]Okay.
[231:49.86]What's that?
[231:50.38]Happy Gilmore, right?
[231:51.41]I would play this game like Happy Gilmore in golf.
[231:54.41]You give me a good driver.
[231:55.65]You give me the Diablo driver from that infomercial.
[231:58.85]The thing that's illegal on every golf course.
[232:01.66]I will Happy Gilmore that 400 yards.
[232:03.76]And then I will give it to somebody else and they will putt the ball for me.
[232:39.72]How are you supposed to get a par 3 at this?
[233:02.23]Someone's going to jump on a rock.
[233:03.37]Watch this.
[233:09.85]Please be careful for safety reasons.
[233:11.13]We ask that you do not shoot over the cliff wall.
[233:13.53]Don't tell me what to do in my own game.
[233:50.37]Where's my ball?
[233:54.85]Oh shit, that's.
[233:57.09]Yeah.
[233:59.16]Where's the ball?
[234:10.90]I need to buy a new ball.
[234:14.22]Well, the thing told me don't hit it over the whole cliff.
[234:17.90]How do I get a new ball?
[234:21.79]Is it on the... Maybe it's on the other side.
[234:23.37]That actually would be awesome if it was.
[234:31.79]It bounced over here.
[234:39.41]You actually have to go find it.
[234:47.85]There it is.
[234:54.15]Dude, this is actually gonna be... Is somebody laying down?
[234:56.49]Did I putt around him?
[235:12.57]Wait, did I hit him with the ball?
[235:57.44]I hit it way too soft or I hit it way too hard.
[235:59.26]There's no Goldilocks in the middle.
[236:03.78]That just scared me, whatever that was.
[236:11.81]Yeah!
[236:18.49]Why am I not freaking out about this?
[236:26.01]Paw 6, I got it.
[236:28.43]Ah, whatever.
[236:28.85]Where's the other hole?
[236:36.97]Ball cleaner?
[236:39.47]I love this thing.
[236:41.16]The only cool thing about golf is that thing.
[236:51.92]Look at your scorecard.
[237:01.22]This one's bad.
[237:02.28]I will give you that.
[237:09.91]How do I get back to the game?
[237:45.09]On his house.
[237:53.15]Always keep a club out.
[237:53.95]Just fucking smash somebody.
[237:55.09]Parents lawn and landscape too expensive.
[238:00.54]Homes only out of range.
[238:02.86]Overbooked greener grass plus special specializes in large remote area.
[238:08.12]Not many reviews.
[238:09.30]Bizarre ad.
[238:31.34]I got scared that the game lagged for a second and then the thing actually scared me.
[238:39.95]What do I do?
[238:40.67]What do I do?
[238:51.80]Wh- I jumped the fence!
[238:53.06]What am I, a fucking cow?
[238:55.22]Wha- I- I can't- I can jump that!
[238:56.62]Am I a dog?
[239:10.86]Holy shit.
[239:23.30]Think we're about halfway, right?
[239:24.36]12 holes.
[239:34.95]Each golf ball that enters the water will cost an additional fee for recovery.
[239:37.95]Please do not try to retrieve the ball yourself.
[239:41.19]Par four.
[239:41.73]Alright.
[239:42.53]Can I just smash this over this?
[239:43.63]Whatever.
[239:43.83]Yeah.
[239:44.11]Okay.
[239:44.35]I'm going to go boom that way.
[239:48.25]Is there water there?
[239:56.07]There is water here.
[239:57.07]Shit.
[240:04.79]I wonder, can I do that?
[240:06.16]If I just go that way, can I just smash it over there?
[240:17.09]Or booms, because you should be able to do it.
[240:18.45]I'll play it safe.
[240:45.27]Three big ones and then one small boom.
[240:48.53]It's not going to win.
[240:49.31]I'm making that thing on this channel, right?
[240:51.16]Like I said that like three times and now I'm going to start making the big boom kind of reference.
[240:59.40]It's too late now.
[241:00.86]It's too late now.
[241:01.52]I did it.
[241:01.82]I did it like two days ago.
[241:04.07]Here we go.
[241:11.51]This is a long smash.
[241:27.15]What did it do?
[241:27.61]Did it bounce?
[241:29.48]It bounced over here.
[241:30.08]What the hell is this?
[241:33.46]That was... That sucked.
[241:36.04]Where is it from here?
[241:36.78]Alright, I'm going over the rock.
[241:48.21]It hit one of the rocks.
[241:49.21]I'm gonna try to go over this rock.
[242:08.96]I mean, dang it.
[242:10.50]That might have been too much.
[242:17.15]Is that too much?
[242:22.91]Oh, it was perfect, actually.
[242:27.64]Nice.
[242:27.90]Okay.
[242:28.44]Now get the short game on.
[242:37.90]Quit breathing down my neck while I'm trying to putt.
[242:49.90]Come on.
[242:50.52]Sink it.
[242:51.94]Sink it.
[242:53.28]I can do it.
[242:56.24]Sink it.
[243:03.18]Crispy onions.
[243:03.92]They had to be crispy.
[243:09.56]Gotta have crispy onions.
[243:13.16]Alright.
[243:14.20]I'm going to take probably the last break of the night, I would imagine.
[243:16.84]Maybe one more.
[243:20.82]Time flies when you're having fun.
[243:22.68]It's already been an hour.
[243:23.54]That's crazy.
[243:26.23]We got about five or six more of these.
[243:31.19]Daylight savings time.
[243:32.13]Yeah, it's going to kick in.
[243:33.65]That's one of the reasons why this might be it coming up here.
[243:37.45]Uh, cause it's about to be what an hour or two.
[243:43.41]We'll see.
[243:47.33]Nothing scary has happened yet.
[243:48.53]I mean the guy, uh, dead on the golf course and the guy screaming at me in the cabin.
[243:53.12]I like this one though.
[243:53.80]This one, I like, this is a good one.
[243:55.26]I like this one a lot.
[243:59.71]I'll be right back.
[244:01.35]Ads will start in about 20 to 10 to 20 seconds.
[244:05.36]See you in three, four minutes.
[245:16.62]so so
[246:45.19]So,
[247:44.03]Thank you.
[248:19.75]How are we doing?
[248:21.17]Okay, let's get back to it.
[248:33.57]All seven out of 12.
[248:35.01]12 is a par five.
[248:36.78]So we'll see.
[248:43.22]There we are.
[248:46.55]Oh, happy to see you play this game.
[248:47.95]Well, it's fun.
[248:49.26]I like it.
[248:49.98]It's been good so far.
[248:53.18]Put your hair down?
[248:54.02]I did.
[248:55.34]I didn't.
[248:56.13]I have the elvish thing going on.
[249:01.93]My hair is, the problem with my hair is it's really, really light right here.
[249:06.95]It's very light on top and it's very light on the sides.
[249:10.19]So if I push it back behind, it kind of gets bunched up back here and it gets really frizzy here and here and here.
[249:19.74]So I kind of just decided I was going to just leave it here.
[249:24.60]How long do you think it's going to get?
[249:25.50]I bet you it gets the longest it's ever been.
[249:28.95]It's hard to see, but I have like the preview over there.
[249:34.75]It's kind of like down to here at this point.
[249:40.93]Yeah, like it down here.
[249:41.75]This is the longest it's ever been for sure.
[249:48.66]Grow it more, grow it more.
[249:52.30]I don't give a shit.
[249:52.96]I'm whatever.
[249:57.24]Looks good.
[249:58.88]Yeah, I kind of told myself like last year that as I get a little older and as I turn about, I'm 39 now and I turned 40 this year.
[250:09.13]This might be the last time.
[250:10.09]It might be the last chance I get to actually do this, right?
[250:12.73]Might be the last chance.
[250:14.87]I don't know how this is going to stay.
[250:16.77]I don't know how it's going to be two, three, four years from now, but if I can do it, I said I wanted to do it at least once in my life, so.
[250:26.59]I think I'm going to be alright though.
[250:30.11]If I'm going to be 40 this year.
[250:33.73]Then.
[250:34.33]It might be.
[250:36.69]It's probably going to be here for a little longer.
[250:38.03]Probably already would have happened.
[250:41.99]What the fuck was that?
[250:49.88]We gotta go with one shot, right?
[250:50.62]Where is it?
[251:35.96]Nice.
[251:36.84]Good shot.
[251:38.30]What the fuck is happening?
[251:40.30]I don't like this.
[251:47.66]I think things are breathing on me.
[251:49.31]I don't like when people breathe on my neck when I'm putting.
[251:57.47]Good.
[251:57.75]Alright.
[252:09.15]Not as hard this time.
[252:10.05]Actually, maybe.
[252:10.75]I think I do have to do it hard.
[252:15.03]No, not that hard.
[252:18.01]Come on.
[252:23.31]Get in that hole.
[252:25.92]Eagle time.
[252:26.38]Let's go.
[252:29.38]Golf is kind of fun.
[252:34.06]Golf is... I'm having a good time playing some golf.
[252:45.28]Can I sink this from this far away, do you think?
[253:16.04]I hit that so hard, I smashed it!
[253:52.02]Yeah, double bogey.
[253:52.97]I'll take a double bogey with cheese and onions.
[253:56.23]And A1 sauce and jalapeños.
[254:24.11]Yeah, what?
[254:24.75]What is it?
[254:26.03]Behind me?
[254:31.60]Where is it?
[254:54.17]I got my clubs, right?
[255:03.80]You need to return to the clubhouse.
[255:04.88]A shortcut back will be available just beyond this hole.
[255:07.60]Refreshments are available.
[255:10.75]This is smush, smush.
[255:14.23]Got it.
[255:32.92]Alright, should I just go really high like this?
[255:35.88]Or keep it as a line drive?
[255:49.38]Right there.
[255:57.56]There's a person here.
[255:58.16]There's a person here.
[256:00.15]This is actually a scary game.
[256:01.75]This is a scary game.
[256:02.77]It's a scary game.
[256:03.59]And he's got the fucking sus guy face.
[256:10.35]Okay.
[256:25.77]Um...
[256:28.01]Look but don't stare.
[256:28.99]That was like a thumbnail.
[256:34.35]That was literally a thumbnail face.
[256:44.59]And I don't OK if I get a quadruple bogey, it doesn't matter.
[256:56.54]I'm not holding a club.
[257:03.25]I gotta grab the clubs immediately.
[257:04.83]We gotta- we gotta just drive and then drive.
[257:06.75]Here we go.
[257:08.58]I'm not gonna scream like a f***ing idiot again.
[257:28.89]What?
[257:30.98]You have to look.
[257:32.94]Oh my God.
[257:33.46]You have to keep looking at them.
[257:36.34]All this.
[257:36.66]I was having fun playing golf and just talking about fucking hamburgers.
[257:50.95]How long is a stair?
[257:51.87]Dude, hit the fucking golf ball.
[257:58.39]Hit the fucking golf ball, man.
[257:59.67]I don't have any clubs.
[258:02.02]Okay, this is hard.
[258:12.98]Oh my god, this sucks.
[258:21.71]I can't.
[258:22.93]I can't.
[258:33.28]It said look but don't stare.
[258:34.74]Doesn't that mean if I look for too long he's gonna get me anyways?
[258:46.65]It's long.
[258:47.20]It's long.
[258:48.04]Okay.
[259:00.61]This one sucks.
[259:01.25]I don't like this one anymore.
[259:03.09]Why is it all the way back here again?
[259:04.49]Getting away from my fucking clubs, man.
[259:18.13]I need to get my clubs back.
[259:45.21]This is a good one.
[259:48.67]This is a really good one, but fuck this one.
[259:57.94]Wrong one.
[260:04.53]I can't do this.
[260:09.87]Oh my God.
[260:18.67]Come on, get out of my fucking way.
[260:23.68]He's standing right next to the hole, man.
[260:25.22]Whoa.
[260:39.47]Fuck you, get away from me.
[260:43.79]How far... Stop looking away, but I don't know how long it is for you to stare.
[261:27.47]I need to get it out of the way.
[261:30.21]Par six, dude.
[261:31.61]I need to get him out of here.
[261:47.20]I gotta lock in.
[261:47.84]Alright, I'm locking in right now.
[261:48.88]Here we go.
[261:49.20]Lock it in.
[262:17.78]Where's the fucking ball?
[262:32.41]Guys, I'm not cut out for this one.
[262:33.65]I'm not cut out for this one.
[262:34.69]This one's fucked up.
[262:35.67]This one's so nerve-wracking.
[262:37.40]I can't do it.
[262:38.92]I can't do it.
[262:41.18]I can't do it.
[262:41.78]He's so close to me.
[262:42.70]I'm never going to get this.
[262:54.75]Oh, this is, what a brilliant idea this is though.
[262:56.97]This is a good idea.
[263:00.47]Play golf with this shit.
[263:02.02]Alright, he's in my view.
[263:03.68]Line it up.
[263:04.50]Who cares?
[263:05.70]Nice and good.
[263:07.36]I hate golf.
[263:09.42]I don't like golf.
[263:10.89]I'm not playing golf.
[263:12.15]If this was baseball, I'd be winning.
[263:22.90]Fuck off.
[263:23.73]Hey.
[263:24.92]Watch this putt.
[263:51.05]Holy shit, this one's scary.
[264:09.04]Wow.
[264:09.86]Okay, well now I know that's it.
[264:11.06]Now I get it.
[264:12.70]So an indicator pops up over his head when it's almost happening, right?
[264:15.71]Yeah, this one's...
[264:35.40]Did somebody just ResidentSleeper?
[266:13.83]I think I'm live am I live dude this happened this happened before too I don't know what's up with this hey we're back but I okay I got I got some bad news I got some really bad news sorry gamers I got some bad news uh so obs crashed at streamlabs obs whatever crashed
[266:41.34]It did this, remember it did this like last week too?
[266:43.44]It just like exited OBS.
[266:45.76]And then it thinks I'm still live, so I can't connect back.
[266:50.70]It's like, oh, your stream key is currently being used.
[266:52.56]It's like, because it was doing the disconnect thing.
[266:54.38]I got bad news.
[266:57.92]The game, as I was kind of fumbling around, I kind of quit the game.
[267:01.72]I don't know.
[267:08.69]Oh wait, I can do it.
[267:10.76]Oh, I thought it said locked.
[267:15.59]Oh, we got good news then.
[267:22.97]Okay.
[267:23.17]What hole was I on?
[267:28.19]Oh, shit.
[267:28.81]Twitch wants to do an ad break.
[267:30.95]Oh, fuck.
[267:31.47]A pre-roll's back on now?
[267:33.21]Oh, come on, man.
[267:34.57]Alright.
[267:34.89]Here's what we're going to do.
[267:38.95]So it was at exactly nine.
[267:40.73]Alright.
[267:41.67]So pre-rolls are back on.
[267:44.35]Let's maybe let people trickle in maybe.
[267:47.78]I guess I just turn them off.
[267:49.12]Alright.
[267:49.40]Like we're at the end of the night anyways.
[267:50.64]I'll just turn them off.
[267:51.38]I mean, you're going to get pre-rolls for the rest of the night here, but I don't know.
[267:56.58]I'm not going to run three minutes of ads right now.
[267:58.14]We're not doing that.
[268:01.17]Do what you got to do.
[268:02.85]Are you guys cool with that?
[268:04.17]If we wait till people trickle back in, I'll do it like a BRB and we'll finish this.
[268:10.53]Because people are going to get pre-rolls and they should be off technically.
[268:13.71]So if I ran ads like 20, 30 minutes ago, I feel like people are going to, if people are jumping around, they'd be like, wait, what the fuck?
[268:22.19]Alright, let's get it over with.
[268:25.57]And then this will be the last BRB.
[268:27.13]That, I don't know.
[268:27.65]I got to figure out why Streamlabs is doing that.
[268:30.53]Because it just exited.
[268:32.81]It just completely exited the game.
[268:35.60]Well, not, it exited OBS.
[268:38.88]So I don't know.
[268:43.79]It's very weird.
[268:44.77]But yeah, when they pop up here, I'll just take the break.
[268:49.09]So in the meantime, let's just go like this.
[268:51.53]Am I actually in the right spot?
[268:55.83]Just reload the hole.
[269:02.27]This is correct, right?
[269:11.75]Alright, so when, uh... We'll take that break in about five minutes.
[269:17.34]So... Man, my heart was just, like, pounding, and then, like, the computer started freaking out.
[269:23.19]It scared me even more.
[269:24.23]And then it said my stream key was in use, and I was like, what the fuck just happened?
[269:27.23]Alright, we're good.
[269:37.44]Falling courses pass under the entry bridge to this island.
[269:40.52]Please do not climb upon any part of the bridge.
[270:00.24]Okay, here we go.
[270:11.58]line drive is he back I don't see him is the game a bit louder oh
[270:33.86]I think it's just this hole.
[270:40.40]Could drop it a little bit though if it's too awful to listen to.
[270:42.84]Is that better?
[270:54.85]I'm so terrified he's going to show up again.
[271:14.75]I suck so bad at this.
[271:29.05]I suck.
[271:30.13]I suck.
[271:39.42]It's too hard.
[271:40.74]Putting is too hard in this game.
[271:42.38]It's too hard.
[271:56.55]What the fuck is going on with this?
[272:03.12]I feel like if I do it too slow, it goes two feet in front of me.
[272:07.12]If I go too hard, it goes over there.
[272:09.22]What the fuck?
[272:28.71]What are you doing here?
[272:30.47]Who are you?
[272:37.45]I hurt my neck hurts now.
[272:38.93]It's bad.
[272:40.55]Well, I'm going.
[272:41.15]Just dickheads.
[273:10.20]It's like pulled a muscle in the back of my head.
[273:19.39]It's 1025.
[273:19.81]Yeah.
[273:20.07]Did you forget the ball?
[273:25.05]I hope not.
[273:25.55]I don't know why.
[273:28.19]I just wanted to hold down tab to see what my mind was thinking.
[273:35.61]Alright.
[273:36.21]Uh, we're almost here.
[273:36.95]We're at hole 10.
[273:38.37]Uh, I'm going to take this break and we'll go from there.
[273:44.71]I'll see you guys in three.
[273:45.35]And this will be, this will be the last break is whenever, whenever I, if I get to the end of this game or I don't, then that's it.
[273:51.22]So you talk to your brain like Homer Simpson does.
[273:54.26]Yeah.
[273:54.56]Sometimes, uh, I'll be right back.
[273:58.25]That last scare hurt.
[273:59.19]Yeah.
[274:02.00]Last break before the last break.
[274:03.44]Yeah.
[274:04.00]Hopefully it doesn't crash the fucking OBS.
[274:10.66]So hopefully this will get rid of the pre-rolls are still off.
[274:16.44]Oh shit.
[274:17.94]Um, I think they're about to start.
[274:30.92]Uh, okay.
[274:32.80]So it still counted, even though the stream was a new stream?
[274:37.06]Oh, shit.
[274:37.66]Okay, well, they're going.
[274:40.93]Sorry about that, guys.
[274:43.25]But I guess I'll take the last break here.
[274:47.79]What a sellout.
[274:49.76]I did not intend to do this.
[274:51.22]I'm sorry.
[274:53.48]But we'll be right back.
[277:17.17]Okay.
[277:18.13]I'm back.
[277:22.92]Wait for everybody else to be back.
[277:27.86]Okay.
[277:28.58]We are officially, uh, should be officially ad free for the rest of the evening.
[277:39.80]And here we go.
[277:42.38]So that was whole nine.
[277:46.50]It just crashed.
[277:49.52]Oh, man.
[277:52.41]Something weird's going on.
[277:53.37]I gotta, like, defrag my hard drive or something.
[277:56.59]What is going on here?
[277:59.53]I guess I could just open it up and do it again?
[278:01.15]That was, like, just a game crash.
[278:06.51]That was not... I mean, it looks like we're still live.
[278:12.71]Uh, okay.
[278:14.65]What is going on with this?
[278:24.45]I guess I have to do that whole nine again, but I kind of already know what's going on.
[278:30.28]Yeah, this part of the stream has been completely cursed.
[278:49.09]I mean, if we crash again, I might kind of just have to take the L here.
[278:56.20]I can turn this down too because we know what happens on this hole.
[279:08.79]Go drive.
[279:12.97]Reload hole.
[279:13.71]I don't think I can because technically I wasn't in a hole.
[279:21.94]but this this one's just you just golf and then the guy comes up and screams at you and scares the shit out of you so
[279:50.14]It's funny when I don't give a shit, I get a way better score.
[279:53.78]Because I'm... This is uphill.
[279:55.70]So I'm going to smush this.
[279:57.63]I'm going to crush it.
[279:58.69]Because every time I've done this, it has been short by about five feet.
[280:19.40]Is the DPI of my mouse wrong?
[280:21.84]Or too high or something?
[280:22.84]Because... Or too low?
[280:26.17]You know what I mean?
[280:26.69]It doesn't matter.
[280:27.17]I already did this hole.
[280:27.95]I don't care.
[280:28.31]I'm just going.
[280:42.82]Can I do the thing with the mini golf where you just drag it into the hole and you have the face, that mad face?
[280:56.37]Here comes jump scare coming up like right now.
[280:58.76]It's actually that was horrible.
[280:59.74]So here comes 321 scary.
[281:04.18]Gary.
[281:05.54]Yep, he's printing.
[281:07.36]Who are you?
[281:13.81]Well, stay from the county house.
[281:15.87]It's bad.
[281:20.77]Well, I'm going.
[281:28.98]Why are they faster than you?
[281:33.52]Okay, we've officially gotten back to where we were.
[281:35.99]Very nice.
[281:36.57]Let's go.
[281:36.93]Hold 10.
[281:40.79]You know what?
[281:41.09]I'm going to turn it down.
[281:45.07]I'm going to turn this down.
[281:48.59]Not for you, but for me.
[281:55.58]OK.
[281:55.68]Let's continue.
[282:01.18]Console gamer.
[282:19.29]Did you buy a THX sound system only to turn the volume down?
[282:26.12]No, I don't... I have a little sound bar.
[282:30.98]I don't do the surround sound shit.
[282:33.22]No.
[282:37.45]Okay, here we go.
[282:38.93]All the way forward to the left.
[282:42.87]Our beautiful course is accompanied by a beautiful gift shop inside of the club.
[282:46.79]Where we sell decorative golf balls, snow globes, and clothing.
[282:50.60]Okay.
[282:55.90]I have a feeling that's gonna... that guy's gonna show up.
[283:00.39]Here we go.
[283:00.83]Ready?
[283:06.57]I'm preparing for it.
[283:07.75]And it's left in the... I have to hit to the left.
[283:18.48]No?
[283:25.74]Get over here.
[283:56.21]What the fuck, man?
[283:57.16]I thought I had time.
[283:58.74]Oh, my hand hurts.
[284:06.96]No, you know what?
[284:08.06]Fuck this.
[284:09.58]I got a better idea.
[284:20.31]We're putting it up in front of us.
[284:33.81]so so so
[284:56.70]Where's the ball?
[284:57.12]Where's the ball?
[285:00.53]Where's the ball?
[285:07.65]Did it go all the way down?
[285:08.77]It went all the way down.
[285:23.85]I think I, wait, can I go get it?
[285:25.71]I think I have to die.
[285:30.79]Yeah, it went over the edge.
[285:35.58]Look down, there are two balls.
[285:36.98]That's a good one.
[285:40.30]Just kill me.
[285:42.82]Kill me.
[285:43.04]Alright, this one is static electricity.
[285:55.60]You look like a lion that was made into a human.
[285:59.36]That's pretty cool.
[286:23.36]Alright.
[287:00.24]Okay.
[287:00.34]I'm gonna hit it over the rock.
[287:04.69]And three, two, one.
[287:06.65]Good.
[287:08.59]Go.
[287:09.95]God.
[287:10.75]Hit the ball directly into his face.
[287:34.87]Can I do that?
[287:35.45]Can I just drive it into his head?
[287:37.00]I gotta get him away from the ball.
[288:17.99]Fuck you.
[288:31.98]Oh shit, I gotta... I gotta wrap him around.
[289:02.72]I suck at putting.
[289:04.38]I suck at it.
[289:06.02]But it's so hard.
[289:07.00]Get the fuck- No, get out of here.
[289:26.51]No, get out of here.
[289:27.11]I just got it.
[289:27.47]Get out of here.
[289:27.85]Get away from me.
[289:30.50]Get away from it.
[289:30.96]I sunk it.
[289:31.42]I sunk it.
[289:31.86]Get out of here.
[289:33.14]Why is he not leaving?
[289:40.79]Why is he not leaving?
[289:43.34]You're not going to follow me to the end of the game, are you?
[289:46.50]No, I got to get the ball.
[290:23.12]Okay.
[290:23.28]I'm good.
[290:25.52]I got my clubs.
[290:26.10]I got the ball.
[290:26.62]I'm out of here.
[290:35.30]I'm going to run into another person right now, aren't I?
[290:38.27]Where is he?
[290:44.65]He's still here.
[290:49.88]Dude, no way.
[290:50.94]Hole 11.
[290:53.34]It's a little island.
[290:54.22]No way.
[290:57.38]I got to keep going with this shit on me.
[291:00.71]Oh, fuck off.
[291:03.38]Get out of here!
[291:05.74]I gotta run him down here.
[291:06.44]We have to take him all the way down here.
[291:32.41]Alright, here's the plan.
[291:33.13]Grab the driver, I'm gonna hit it down here.
[291:43.09]Oh my goodness, I almost got grabbed.
[291:49.43]I wanna see... Who else has played this game?
[291:51.99]Any other streamers, YouTubers or anything?
[291:53.39]I wanna see people play this.
[291:54.25]This one's awesome.
[291:56.18]This is horrible.
[292:02.56]Okay, here we go.
[292:04.36]Ugh.
[292:19.37]Oh my god, there's another one.
[292:20.25]There's another one.
[292:20.73]There's another one.
[292:21.15]This is two now.
[292:21.93]There's two here.
[292:22.49]There's actually two now.
[292:24.98]You got to be shitting me.
[292:26.94]There's no way anybody is going to beat this with a... There's no way.
[292:31.08]This is fucking unbelievable.
[292:33.50]This is unbelievable.
[292:34.68]I'm freaking out.
[292:35.66]Where's the other one?
[292:36.28]Where's the other one?
[292:36.96]I don't know where he went.
[292:42.62]They're actually both in a good spot.
[292:45.00]Oh, this sucks.
[292:52.63]That one's running even when I'm looking at him.
[293:07.08]It's going in the fucking water.
[293:09.56]That was such a shitty putt.
[293:11.40]That was such a shitty hit.
[293:15.90]Hey, you gotta do it slowly but surely.
[293:17.22]You gotta do what you gotta do, right?
[293:28.00]fucking ball what are you doing oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit I gotta I don't know I gotta run this way

[294:09.56]Wait, did I... Okay.
[294:13.15]I'm... I don't know if he's going to come back.
[294:15.21]Is he coming back?
[294:20.71]I think I just lost that one.
[294:22.45]That's the strategy right there.
[294:23.45]Alright, perfect.
[294:31.30]Oh my goodness.
[294:31.88]Yes.
[294:34.39]This game is rough, but it's fun though.
[294:39.37]Alright, let's get this.
[295:17.76]No way.
[295:20.43]Are you kidding me?
[295:23.49]Oh, that sucks absolute ass.
[295:34.53]They're gone, though.
[295:40.66]Okay, it's just... I think it's... I think it's just the one now.
[295:46.18]Unless, no, he's going to come from around the other side.
[295:48.44]Yep.
[295:49.26]Oh my God.
[295:50.22]What a fucking bunch of shit.
[296:03.11]I swear, man.
[296:05.61]What a bunch of shit.
[296:09.64]I'm dead.
[296:10.58]I'm dead.
[296:10.96]I'm dead.
[296:11.34]I'm dead.
[296:32.60]I had it too.
[296:33.92]That sucks that it can roll off the bridge.
[296:35.86]Oh, what a tough game.
[296:37.78]This is hard.
[296:40.88]Hmm, okay.
[296:43.86]Can you hit them with the club?
[296:44.88]I don't think you can.
[296:48.66]I need to have it line drive smash it.
[296:53.47]Just kill me.
[296:54.91]Just kill me.
[296:55.53]Just come and eat me or whatever you do.
[296:56.89]Because that was a terrible fucking hit.
[297:01.70]Wait, actually, it's down.
[297:02.60]It's down.
[297:25.56]I got to get him out of here.
[297:26.28]Alright, I'm going to just let's just get this out of the way.
[297:30.90]I'm going to drag this guy up here.
[297:31.96]Because he will de-aggro if you bring him up to this one.
[297:56.00]Yep, there he goes.
[297:56.52]Alright.
[297:56.86]And then we're very far away now.
[297:58.52]I should be alright now.
[297:59.16]Okay, let's go.
[298:09.58]I should get a pretty good distance from this guy now.
[298:34.69]Where are my clubs?
[298:38.94]I think there's a max range that they have to be at.
[298:41.02]Alright, here we go.
[298:45.11]Send it right here.
[298:57.54]Alright, good.
[298:57.88]Alright, so far so good.
[299:00.04]Let's go.
[299:16.41]Alright, gentle, gentle, gentle, gentle.
[299:19.87]I'm playing it safe.
[299:20.85]I'm bringing him all the way up.
[299:44.07]I can't.
[299:46.96]I can't.
[299:47.24]I'm too locked in right now.
[299:53.26]Alright.
[299:55.39]I gotta be super careful here.
[300:12.13]I went for it.
[300:12.69]I went for it.
[300:13.21]I went for it.
[300:13.61]I think I did it.
[300:14.07]I did it.
[300:15.39]I'm good.
[300:15.59]I'm good.
[300:16.03]I did it.
[300:16.32]I went for it.
[300:16.72]I had to just, I had to lock the fuck in right there.
[300:19.40]Alright.
[300:22.00]Now I'm going to play very, very carefully.
[300:23.69]I'm going to take them back pretty far.
[301:08.57]Max range him.
[301:11.19]Alright, sink it.
[301:19.19]Let's go.
[301:40.32]I don't want to be on the bridge with them.
[301:56.33]Oh shit.
[301:56.85]I'm playing safe.
[301:58.39]I'm playing it really safe.
[302:04.09]There's no enrage timer, right?
[302:32.49]Alright, sink it.
[302:33.19]We're good.
[302:33.67]Get out.
[302:48.88]Just tap it in.
[302:52.42]You fucking idiot.
[303:09.90]That was as gentle as I could have done that!
[303:12.34]Dude, what the fuck?
[303:19.36]Oh, that's... That stinks.
[303:22.25]But I'm alright.
[303:25.61]You saw how gentle that was too.
[303:27.23]It was... I was so careful.
[303:39.58]Dudes, I am having a little bit of trouble right now.
[303:46.02]This ball is a ping pong ball.
[304:04.37]Fuck off.
[304:05.05]Now get away from me.
[304:15.44]If I went to pick that ball up, I think if you looked down, I think he would have got me.
[304:21.95]Don't do that to me.
[304:22.61]Okay, we're good.
[304:33.83]All 12.
[304:45.59]Oh my God, OK.
[304:49.51]Oh.
[304:51.55]If that's how hard this one was, I can't even imagine how horrible this one is going to be too.
[304:56.55]It's going to be terrible.
[304:58.75]And it's red great.
[305:01.69]It's red.
[305:09.87]Look at them for a little longer.
[305:13.40]Caddy House at the end of this course has refreshments, general core services, and a restroom facility.
[305:17.94]This one's just kind of a straight shot, though.
[305:20.68]Alright, here we go.
[305:24.81]Lock in.
[305:26.61]Everybody get ready.
[305:31.27]Shoulder.
[305:33.39]Let's get comfortable, you know?
[305:34.56]I'm going to be quiet.
[305:37.82]I'm doing this first try.
[305:38.72]Here we go.
[306:35.42]Bunch of fucking trees.
[307:30.94]That was like a dog snoring sound, by the way, if you heard that.
[307:33.12]I don't know if the mic picked it up.
[308:17.02]This water here?
[308:18.30]What the fuck are you talking about?
[308:19.92]This water right there?
[308:21.14]Oh, shit.
[308:30.60]Oh, that sucks.
[308:40.49]Alright, I can do it.
[308:41.25]Come on.
[308:48.84]Right through the middle line drive.
[308:49.96]I got to get you away from me.
[308:51.74]It's right through here.
[308:52.38]Watch this.
[308:52.70]I'm going to cut it just a line drive down the middle.
[308:55.60]Okay.
[309:39.62]Oh, fuck off with these trees.
[309:41.74]This is a bunch of dog shit.
[309:43.38]I don't even know where the ball is.
[309:44.42]Okay.
[310:00.72]I'm just going to speedrun it.
[311:06.19]There's another one.
[311:09.09]There's probably three.
[311:12.97]Oh, guys, I don't know.
[311:14.07]It's like 11 o'clock.
[311:16.39]It's like, what, 2 a.m.?
[311:18.79]Oh, this one might be A. This one might be A. Let's just pretend I did it.
[311:22.23]No.
[311:23.43]No.
[311:25.53]Let's go.
[311:37.04]This is fun.
[311:37.90]I like this one a lot.
[311:38.80]It's fun.
[311:39.82]I have to.
[311:40.31]Here's what I'm doing.
[311:40.87]I'm going to aggro all of them.
[311:43.57]So one pops up.
[311:44.93]Had to have been over here, right?
[311:48.29]Where is it?
[311:48.61]Where is he?
[311:48.93]Where is he?
[311:49.47]I hear him.
[311:55.42]I'm trying to get all of them to come out.
[312:00.24]Maybe the ball has to cross a certain threshold.
[312:39.67]Alright, where is this other one?
[312:42.87]Where does he go?
[312:43.25]Where does he spawn from?
[312:48.08]Where is this other one?
[312:50.26]He grabbed me from behind last time.
[313:26.25]Where is he?
[313:30.36]He's going to be right here, man.
[313:31.80]This is going to suck.
[313:36.89]Where?
[313:37.13]Where?
[313:37.53]Where?
[313:38.63]Oh, my God.
[313:39.25]There he is.
[313:40.07]Okay.
[313:52.58]Sink it.
[313:53.00]Lock in.
[313:53.44]Let's go.
[313:55.57]Third one.
[313:55.87]Where's the third one?
[313:58.23]You know a third one, right?
[314:00.20]Third one?
[314:01.22]No?
[314:30.87]Oh, there's an invisible wall.
[314:32.27]There's an invisible wall.
[314:33.57]Calm down.
[314:34.03]There's an invisible wall.
[314:34.85]Calm down.
[314:35.35]Holy shit.
[314:36.63]I just... A dump just filled my fucking underwear.
[314:48.63]I can't.
[314:49.23]I can't do it.
[314:50.53]I need to... I can't do it.
[314:52.23]I can't.
[314:54.59]Calm down, calm down.
[314:55.95]My nerves are like at a million right now because I just walked into that invisible wall.
[315:00.09]Let's get him the fuck away from me.
[315:04.99]Just get him out of here.
[315:06.81]Pull him back.
[315:08.13]Sink it and run.
[315:14.75]I don't like this positioning at all.
[315:53.64]ball please oh I need um hold this hold there's a 13th hole what are you talking about oh shit invisible wall again
[316:23.91]How do, how do, there's an invisible wall.
[316:25.55]Hole 13, you are fucked.
[316:31.98]Oh no, this is not good.
[317:01.70]Dude, dude, why can't I walk over there?
[317:07.86]Why is there an invisible wall?
[317:10.30]Why is there an invisible wall?
[317:12.73]Why?
[317:13.55]Where am I going?
[317:15.67]Guys, why is there an invisible wall?
[317:17.11]The ball is still in there.
[317:18.59]The ball.
[317:18.91]I got the ball, didn't I?
[317:20.91]I didn't get the ball.
[317:21.47]Yes, I did.
[317:23.09]Guys, I picked that ball up.
[317:23.95]I swear to God, I did.
[317:28.11]No, I got the ball.
[317:28.87]I have the ball.
[317:39.05]What is going on?
[317:40.59]I got the ball, don't I?
[317:41.63]I got the ball.
[317:43.95]I got the ball.
[317:44.37]What's happening?
[317:47.46]What's going on?
[317:48.12]Why can't I fucking keep going?
[317:56.12]I'm stuck.
[318:04.45]The game is known to have a bug.
[318:06.19]Oh fuck.
[318:07.15]Alright, I'm just gonna say I won.
[318:10.96]What if I?
[318:18.90]Check the game facts.
[318:24.67]You're not in story mode.
[318:26.35]Oh.
[318:28.47]Oh no.
[318:37.68]I'm not in story mode.
[318:41.46]Shit.
[318:42.38]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[318:43.57]It's alright.
[318:44.07]There's a lot of stuff after this.
[318:49.11]Oh man.
[318:49.87]Oh dude, that stinks.
[319:01.41]Oh man.
[319:12.25]Too bad.
[319:12.67]OK.
[319:20.65]Pick, can I pick hole 13?
[319:21.73]Just select 13.
[319:28.16]I guess it doesn't count as completing 12.
[319:33.64]13, 14, 15.
[319:33.70]Oh man.
[319:41.48]Well, that's alright though.
[319:42.94]It's getting kind of late.
[319:43.66]I'm probably going to end here.
[319:46.14]Let me just see what happens if I do this.
[319:55.45]Yeah, it's going to start from the beginning.
[319:57.19]This was a really good one.
[319:58.59]That was really going.
[320:01.10]Unfortunate.
[320:01.72]That was intense the whole way though.
[320:06.76]You could beat it real quick and just do no enemy mode.
[320:09.31]It's getting late, though.
[320:10.80]Right now, it's about 2 a.m.
[320:12.54]Eastern.
[320:14.88]I'll be live tomorrow.
[320:16.44]Not with scary games, but I'm going to just do some chill out and game.
[320:23.01]Oh, right.
[320:23.69]3 a.m.
[320:24.13]because of daylight savings is right.
[320:28.89]It's worth it to get to the end.
[320:31.86]Off stream, maybe I'll just get to that point, just golf.
[320:35.52]And then we'll do that another time.
[320:38.70]That was a good one, though.
[320:40.80]Pretty much all of them were fun.
[320:43.55]They all had their own charm to them.
[320:44.61]Out of the, what, five or six that we played tonight?
[320:51.55]No enemies?
[320:52.01]Yeah.
[320:59.59]My neck hurts from that scare?
[321:00.93]Yeah, me too.
[321:03.10]That's right.
[321:03.56]You got it.
[321:03.98]You got it.
[321:04.60]The strategy.
[321:05.04]You got to crack the volume down.
[321:07.20]Volume down 10%.
[321:10.25]Screen brightness down at zero.
[321:12.95]And stand 10 feet away from the screen.
[321:17.31]That's how you play.
[321:17.85]That's how you do it.
[321:18.33]That's how you watch it.
[321:18.95]Alright.
[321:23.54]Thanks a lot, guys.
[321:24.00]Sorry for the crashes.
[321:25.38]I don't know.
[321:26.46]I mean, I got to figure out what's going on.
[321:28.94]Because that's the second time that's happened in two weeks.
[321:32.21]I might need to reinstall OBS and go from there.
[321:38.77]Yeah, thanks for watching.
[321:39.77]Thanks for hanging out.
[321:41.50]See you again tomorrow.
[321:42.26]Tomorrow, probably starting around... I don't know.
[321:46.76]Afternoon?
[321:47.72]Late afternoon?
[321:49.64]Not as late as this one was, but probably a couple hours earlier.
[321:53.04]Probably like two to three.
[321:56.02]I want to play Monster Hunter.
[321:58.68]I want to just kind of get to the high ranks.
[322:02.21]And then... Maybe I'll start with something else.
[322:05.93]We'll see.
[322:07.69]I'll make a decision tomorrow afternoon.
[322:12.29]YouTube the video ending?
[322:14.57]Oh, yeah.
[322:15.31]Okay, I was told that that ending is, like, the one that happens.
[322:19.47]And it can happen some other way, maybe, too.
[322:25.05]You can play Red Alert.
[322:27.30]We've talked about Command & Conquer, yeah?
[322:30.00]I don't know exactly when we're going to do it, but
[322:32.78]We've got a lot to do, so.
[322:36.83]What about Warcraft?
[322:38.35]Yeah, this is just a, it's just a lot.
[322:40.95]Dracula kind of took over.
[322:42.73]We started playing that and then I got really into Dracula and I played it for like five streams.
[322:50.78]But I still want to do WoW.
[322:52.08]I still want to at least get through some of the fun dungeons.
[322:56.60]The character needs to die, right?
[322:58.76]You got to see that death on camera.
[323:04.31]Alright, guys.
[323:04.71]Take care of yourselves.
[323:06.61]See you guys tomorrow at some point.
[323:07.95]Probably afternoon.
[323:08.49]See you soon.
[323:25.60]Thanks for watching.
[323:26.46]Thanks for staying up late.
[323:34.11]Or it could be a morning for you.
[323:35.73]Good morning.
[323:37.35]You're in it EU.
[323:40.42]Some of you, it's probably about 6 by 5 or 6 AM.
[323:52.53]Hey Australia, there's probably a lot of.
[323:55.95]3 PM 6 PM in Australia damn.
[324:12.26]8 PM in New Zealand.
[324:16.79]Well, it's 11 PM here.
[324:29.15]Yeah, well, maybe we'll start with something.
[324:31.38]I know there's a lot of things I want to try to get through tomorrow.
[324:33.26]Tomorrow is going to be pretty chill day, so.
[324:43.95]Omega Gaming Weekend, that's right.
[324:45.79]I think you'd like Pacific Drive if you haven't played it yet.
[324:53.26]I have not.
[324:54.76]I'll definitely look and see what it is.
[324:55.84]I feel like I've heard of it, but I don't remember what exactly it is.
[325:08.57]There's a long credits.
[325:09.55]Looks like there's a lot of subs tonight.
[325:11.27]Holy shit, there was.
[325:13.37]Damn.
[325:17.52]Scary games there.
[325:19.46]Scary games you guys really like, huh?
[325:28.66]I can only do scary games like once every few months.
[325:31.80]They kind of destroy me.
[325:33.14]Alright, take care.
[325:38.16]See you soon.
[325:38.60]Call you mother.
[325:39.96]Have a good rest of your night, guys.
[325:46.12]See you tomorrow.
[325:49.63]you
[326:24.50]Thank you.
