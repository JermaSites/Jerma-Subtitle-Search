[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.94]Hello, everybody.
[00:07.14]Or I'm dropping a lot of frames in the very beginning here.
[00:10.64]Uh-oh.
[00:12.16]This is a bad sign.
[00:13.24]Hopefully it situates itself so we can stream a video game.
[00:22.59]Oof.
[00:24.33]Oof!
[00:25.67]Come on, pull it through here, man.
[00:28.25]Pull it through.
[00:29.49]You can do it.
[00:37.45]Well, at least I hope so.
[00:40.41]But, hello.
[00:43.14]If we're able to stream today, which we should be, hopefully.
[00:47.94]Sam and Max, hope you're having a good day.
[00:51.86]And you all as well.
[00:53.14]I mean, not just Sam and Max.
[00:54.32]I hope they have a great time on stream today.
[01:00.70]Why are all the planets orbiting the moon?
[01:04.32]Uh, because that's what it looks like through a telescope.
[01:10.50]I don't... this... oh, by the way, probably gonna get this remade as well.
[01:17.34]Gonna add some planets, change it up a little bit.
[01:24.21]You thought the title said what?
[01:31.31]Why?
[01:32.01]It's not moon.
[01:33.79]That is the moon.
[01:35.95]But as of tomorrow, I'll give you an internet update here.
[01:40.67]I've been told that they're going to try to fix it tomorrow.
[01:44.99]Somewhere in the plant.
[01:45.93]Who knows what they're going to do.
[01:49.75]But hopefully this is situated as of tomorrow or the next day.
[01:52.59]I'm going to give them a couple days to figure it out.
[01:58.21]But, yep, we're gonna do Salmon Max.
[02:00.15]We are at the point in Salmon Max, episode 3, season 2.
[02:06.49]Episode 4, maybe.
[02:08.07]We'll do the two episodes, see where we're at.
[02:10.94]Starting early because I have to go get Kim later, so I want to be able to do that.
[02:20.66]Starting an hour or two early.
[02:26.67]Give me one second.
[02:28.40]And we'll get started.
[03:35.52]Alright.
[03:38.57]Let me move this out of the way.
[03:39.83]Man, I've dropped 20% of every frame in five minutes.
[03:45.81]Fuck, that's not good.
[03:46.79]That's actually a very, very bad sign to start the stream.
[03:52.56]Not good.
[04:06.00]Not good at all.
[04:12.03]Uh, give me a... Let's just hang out for a minute.
[04:13.87]Because if this continues like this, I might have to change my plan on the fly here.
[04:23.67]It wasn't this bad yesterday.
[04:24.92]Not even close.
[04:26.34]Well, the day before that.
[04:29.26]But this is, like, actually, like, unbearable.
[04:32.46]Ugh.
[04:33.14]Ugh.
[04:36.63]Um... What mouse and keyboard do I use?
[04:44.40]I use an Amazon Basics keyboard.
[04:48.44]And... That's true, I actually do.
[04:51.40]And a Razer DeathAdder.
[05:00.99]What a gamer.
[05:03.87]Yeah, Razer DeathAdder and Amazon Basics.
[05:09.22]We're gonna try.
[05:10.84]Hopefully this kind of gets over it in the next like 20 minutes or so.
[05:19.07]If not, then I have to change plans.
[05:21.07]We're gonna do something else.
[05:21.83]Because I don't want to be dropping 20% of all my frames and try to play something.
[05:26.87]But let's go.
[05:27.87]Let's give it a try.
[05:29.57]Hopefully it fixes itself.
[05:35.36]Anyways, let's get over here.
[05:36.86]Aye, aye, aye.
[05:51.31]Just calm down, Jeremy.
[05:52.92]Just relax.
[05:55.86]Just relax.
[05:57.16]Don't get angry.
[05:58.38]Don't start off in a bad mood.
[05:59.98]Just relax.
[06:01.58]Breathe in, breathe out.
[06:02.52]Let's breathe in.
[06:03.50]Let's do it together.
[06:09.43]And then breathe in.
[06:10.03]I think collectively, if we all do this at the same time, then it'll be, maybe I'll get even more calm down.
[06:19.86]You know?
[06:20.44]If there's like 1,200 people all doing this at the same time, it's gonna affect me.
[06:26.48]I'm gonna get all of your energies.
[06:30.84]And I won't elevate, I'm not gonna elevate my voice today.
[06:33.24]We're gonna stay silent like this.
[06:38.45]Alright, let me restart.
[06:39.27]Because with this game, as you know, it kind of just jumps right into it.
[06:44.74]Again, this is Season 2, Episode 3.
[06:47.94]And I would like to start a new game.
[06:51.62]Keep doing what you're doing, everybody.
[06:52.90]Keep breathing in and breathing out slowly, because it fixed the internet.
[06:58.07]It definitely didn't, but you know.
[07:00.91]Here we go.
[07:12.25]You have interfered with my plans for the last time, Sam and Max.
[07:17.35]Taking your vote will satisfy my dark masters once and for all.
[07:22.47]And then I will use my army of the undead to take over the world.
[07:29.26]Damn you, Yerger!
[07:31.02]You owe me five bucks, Sam.
[07:33.12]I never thought he'd go for the cheesy evil laugh.
[07:35.58]Insolent to the last.
[07:37.48]No matter.
[07:38.60]Oh.
[07:39.06]We shall see how you make this of ice cracks after you are dead.
[07:43.74]Well, looks like this is it, little buddy.
[07:45.64]My whole life is flashing before my eyes.
[07:48.64]I wondered where I left my wallet.
[07:50.74]I can't even remember how we got here.
[07:52.88]Come on, Max.
[07:53.72]Remember, we were back in the office, just back from Easter Island.
[07:57.96]Wait, wait.
[07:58.52]Do the whole thing with the music and all that.
[08:01.28]Oh, alright.
[08:05.25]Police shoot in the intro.
[08:06.95]Yeah, don't worry, I will.
[08:08.17]I'm gonna get them all.
[08:18.71]Here we go.
[08:21.43]We can't... Dude, I need to play some more of these types of games.
[08:31.88]I gotta get some more, like, mouse shooters.
[08:35.53]I feel like I'm pretty good at him.
[08:41.73]Doesn't being high priest of Easter Island and president violate the separation of church and state?
[08:46.95]Blasphemy!
[08:48.79]Oh, hang on.
[08:50.05]The holy water is giving me a religious vision.
[08:54.55]He's turning into Beavis.
[08:56.39]He's turning into, like, Cornholio.
[09:07.34]Bells!
[09:07.80]Bells!
[09:10.28]Bells!
[09:10.78]Hey, not bad.
[09:11.80]Hello, Commissioner?
[09:13.28]What the hell?
[09:20.66]Lightning!
[09:21.30]A dog castle!
[09:22.82]Dad!
[09:23.98]A snowy egret!
[09:25.72]No, a chicken!
[09:26.92]Wait, what?
[09:27.78]Do you mind not making so much noise?
[09:30.60]Speak up, Commissioner.
[09:31.48]I can't hear you.
[09:32.14]We're having a zombie attack.
[09:33.70]What's that, Commissioner?
[09:35.36]Zombie attacks?
[09:36.80]Gin running George A. Romero in a baby doll t-shirt outside the food court with a $43 gift certificate.
[09:42.09]We're on the case.
[09:43.25]The Commissioner says zombie attacks are popping up all over the world.
[09:45.93]Is he washing his armpits?
[09:47.01]Boils on the decaying flesh of, well, a zombie.
[09:50.59]Wait, who's attacking?
[09:52.21]They're coming from someplace called...
[09:54.26]Alright.
[09:54.68]So, Salmon Max.
[09:55.26]Let's increase the volume a little bit.
[09:57.40]To get that authentic Salmon Max experience.
[09:58.74]Welcome, everybody.
[10:21.96]That was the opening cutscene.
[10:23.02]Zombie apocalypse.
[10:24.52]Incoming.
[10:31.22]See, I think the internet has settled.
[10:33.36]It's still kind of not good.
[10:35.25]But this guy's still in here.
[10:36.67]He's been in here for like three weeks.
[10:40.57]Hey, Leonard.
[10:46.19]Is there any lore?
[10:47.29]Do we feed this guy?
[10:49.03]Does he eat?
[10:53.53]What about Jimmy?
[10:56.31]No, no, he's still alive.
[10:57.75]Yeah, but like, we have to feed him.
[10:59.63]We can't just like let him die in there.
[11:01.05]Alright.
[11:04.55]I just want to look around the office a little bit.
[11:06.89]It's been a while.
[11:07.51]We got... He uses photosynthesis.
[11:20.83]Should I do that?
[11:27.59]I'm doing that one day.
[11:28.92]Alright, I'm doing that, like, soon.
[11:30.60]I'm doing that as soon as fucking possible.
[11:36.68]I'm gonna do a full domino setup when I'm gonna, like, set a ball up and knock him down somewhere.
[11:50.92]Yeah.
[11:51.80]Yeah, we are.
[11:54.08]I'm doing a full dub.
[11:55.02]Actually, this is a zombie apocalypse.
[12:00.36]Alright, well, Jimmy, what's going on here?
[12:02.88]What do you think?
[12:03.69]That's legitimately the only thing worse.
[12:21.13]Then another Nintendo Labo stream.
[12:25.15]Not if I... Not if I hire, like, five people to help me do it.
[12:29.88]You know?
[12:31.78]Not if I hired, like, five people.
[12:34.48]And we make a huge one.
[12:38.32]Clowns.
[12:40.91]Do you know anything about the zombie factory?
[12:42.87]Nope.
[12:44.23]We're screwed, Sam!
[12:45.81]That rat was our only lead!
[12:48.14]Next Labo stream confirmed.
[12:49.65]Alright, can we talk to the zombies?
[12:50.89]Alright, what about this giant stein?
[12:57.57]Alright, so they drink.
[13:00.11]So they're not actually zombies.
[13:04.22]They're just, like, drunk?
[13:05.14]Alright.
[13:16.76]Are these just like really drunk people?
[13:19.04]Alright, what do I think down here?
[13:23.16]Let's start all the way.
[13:24.04]Zombies eat for free here.
[13:26.78]Let's check this out.
[13:32.33]Make a Rube Goldberg machine.
[13:36.41]Yeah, maybe you should talk about this with your therapist.
[13:40.09]She was my therapist.
[13:42.21]I need to hire, like, an engineer to be able to do that.
[13:44.72]Oh, good.
[13:44.88]Lamont and Wallace, you're here.
[13:46.90]Sam and Max, actually.
[13:48.68]Whatever.
[13:49.24]Your friend here is driving me crazy.
[13:51.62]Take him off my hands, would you?
[13:54.30]What's wrong with Lincoln?
[13:57.89]Lincoln, what's gone?
[13:58.51]What's gone?
[13:58.93]What's gone, Lincoln?
[13:59.97]I'm shaking, Abraham.
[14:01.53]She's gone.
[14:03.07]Left me.
[14:07.63]Uh... You talking about Sybil?
[14:10.84]Sybil!
[14:11.44]Of course she left you!
[14:12.96]She dumped you like yesterday's breakfast when she caught you macking on the moai heads!
[14:17.26]I was sure it was just one of her moods.
[14:21.85]Do you know anything about a zombie factory?
[14:24.53]Do you mean like a factory that comes to life after it's been shut down, cranking out products in a hideous parody of actual production, destroying other factories it comes into contact with?
[14:34.70]No, that's not what we're looking for.
[14:36.50]But I wish we were!
[14:37.46]Do you know anything about zombies?
[14:40.80]What do you know about zombies?
[14:42.32]Pests.
[14:43.24]Hooligans.
[14:44.38]They always gather outside the memorial with their million zombie rallies and groanings.
[14:51.34]Always playing that awful music they listen to.
[14:57.06]Alright.
[14:57.46]Well, how do you stop a zombie?
[14:58.50]How do you stop a zombie?
[15:00.24]Beats me.
[15:01.33]Just between the three of us.
[15:02.61]I'm pretty hopeless at anything except making speeches.
[15:05.19]Okay.
[15:09.95]What?
[15:11.29]That doesn't sound right.
[15:14.17]Let's do all dialog options.
[15:15.45]Take it like a man.
[15:16.81]Think of all the advantages of being single.
[15:19.31]Like what?
[15:21.28]Cox Jupiter.
[15:22.42]Yeah, this is really bad.
[15:25.00]I'm so desperately trying to swallow my rage right now.
[15:28.83]You have no idea.
[15:32.69]If the webcam was on.
[15:34.39]I keep looking over here and seeing it go down to, like, zero.
[15:37.23]And I, like, if the webcam was on, you would see, like, like this.
[15:43.31]Ready?
[15:43.87]This is what I'm doing.
[15:48.74]Yeah, ready?
[15:49.14]Look at this.
[15:53.01]Every, like, minute or two, this is what I do.
[15:55.75]Like, I'm looking over here, I'm trying to pay attention, and I look over and I go... It happens, like, every 30 seconds.
[16:07.83]I gotta fucking, like, just chill.
[16:10.53]I'm so fucking, like, tortured right now.
[16:14.02]I am being... I'm tortured.
[16:17.62]I look like Abraham Lincoln.
[16:19.94]What?! !
[16:40.16]That's fine with me.
[16:41.90]Hey, Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs.
[16:48.08]He is a lot taller than I am, but thank you, Kazzy.
[16:53.56]He's like seven feet tall.
[16:55.07]You can do what you want, when you want.
[16:56.95]You answer to nobody.
[16:58.75]And nobody cares if you die.
[17:02.49]Play the field.
[17:03.03]Grow a Lincoln beard for next stream.
[17:04.43]I don't think I could do that.
[17:05.57]I don't think this is helping very much.
[17:07.37]Do it.
[17:07.55]I can't grow a beard.
[17:08.19]Don't you guys understand?
[17:31.05]Keep a stiff, hairless upper lip, Abe.
[17:33.29]Always.
[17:33.45]Soup Store, thanks for the five community subs.
[17:34.93]Thank you, Soup Store.
[17:36.66]Back-to-back five community sub drops here.
[17:39.06]Thanks a lot, guys.
[17:41.96]Any items in here?
[17:45.78]Dude, you know what actually might be causing this internet problem here?
[17:50.86]And that always seems to correlate with it.
[17:53.17]Is when we get these crazy fucking wins.
[17:57.75]That's definitely what it is.
[17:59.89]It's just like doing damage to something and then they gotta fix it.
[18:02.61]There's like crazy winds.
[18:04.93]You probably hear it.
[18:08.55]Yeah, whatever.
[18:09.85]I'm not gonna let it bother me.
[18:10.81]Let's just play.
[18:16.30]I turn on the webcam and I'm like, like hanging onto a pole sideways.
[18:20.04]Help!
[18:22.62]If only I had the wherewithal to get that prepared.
[18:29.00]Hiya, cops.
[18:30.24]Do you know... Hi there.
[18:31.46]Are you tired of paying a lot for your internet service?
[18:34.83]What?
[18:35.29]Yeah, actually I am.
[18:36.61]Really?
[18:37.23]Well, those days are over.
[18:38.83]Welcome to a new type of internet access.
[18:41.75]S.O.L.
[18:43.25]So simple even a zombie could use it.
[18:46.65]Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[18:51.80]Do you know anything about a place called Spy Factory?
[18:54.57]Processing.
[18:56.11]We have gathered extensive marketing data on zombies.
[19:00.57]Zombies need an easier, less expensive way to access the Internet.
[19:05.01]That's why we developed Stuttgart Online for the greatest concentration of newly active zombies, Stuttgart, Germany.
[19:13.28]You've unlocked a new area.
[19:15.30]What'd he say that for?
[19:16.72]We do not know.
[19:18.42]He has been like this ever since the accident.
[19:22.10]Max, when I'm done yammering, remind me we gotta drive to Stuttgart, quick like a zombie.
[19:26.49]Drive to Stuttgart, right.
[19:28.39]Forgot it already.
[19:30.48]Okay.
[19:31.20]So you're selling the internet to zombies.
[19:32.32]You're selling the internet to zombies?
[19:34.22]Not just the internet, but much, much more.
[19:38.38]From trivia to music, lifestyles to death styles, and inventive new recipes for brains, Stuttgart Online is the premier online... Dude, that's where the best internet is.
[19:48.03]What am I thinking?
[19:48.75]I gotta move to Stuttgart.
[19:53.36]Move to EU, move to EU.
[19:54.74]I keep hearing it.
[19:55.52]Alright, let's go.
[19:58.72]Stuttgart.
[20:01.14]Didn't we destroy the internet?
[20:02.90]Luckily, Al Gore was able to recreate the internet from his original plans.
[20:10.05]What's on the internet that would interest a droning, glassy-eyed zombie anyway?
[20:14.43]Al Gore recreated the internet in his own image.
[20:20.91]What is so great about Stuttgart Online?
[20:23.65]It's the fun, easy-to-use online experience for zombies and zombies at heart.
[20:31.62]Okay.
[20:32.85]What about the car?
[20:33.73]We just want to pimp our car.
[20:35.23]We no longer offer car upgrades.
[20:38.61]Our income has been lower than previously forecast.
[20:42.15]But this neighborhood has the highest accident rate in five states.
[20:46.33]We have spent a lot of this year out of town, Max.
[20:49.81]Oh, right.
[20:51.13]So we've devoted our resources to developing the ultimate online experience, SOL.
[20:56.89]He finally wants to upgrade.
[20:59.28]Alright, well, what happened to the other thing?
[21:00.47]What happened to Bluster Blaster?
[21:02.01]Where's Bluster Blaster?
[21:03.55]There was a processing accident while developing our latest invention.
[21:09.75]I'm fine, Sam.
[21:11.55]Haddock is the best kind of fish.
[21:13.30]That's a different person.
[21:14.30]I'm fine, Sam.
[21:15.86]We regret any inconveniences may have come.
[21:19.54]I'm fine, Sam.
[21:21.06]Thanks for asking.
[21:22.36]I'm fine, Sam.
[21:23.99]I'm fine, Sam.
[21:26.11]I like that one.
[21:27.47]That's a good one.
[21:29.37]Can you guys fix it?
[21:30.41]Can you guys fix Blaster Blaster?
[21:32.41]They had me fixed before they brought me home.
[21:34.77]Sounds like Homer.
[21:36.91]It is Homer Simpson.
[21:40.30]After all this time, you're not offering any car upgrades?
[21:44.00]None at all.
[21:45.60]We regret the inconvenience.
[21:50.40]It is much too dangerous.
[21:53.27]intrigued go on it's the super high powered antenna for wireless internet access while on the road there are problems using it could result in catastrophic electrical failure and spontaneous expansion of your vehicle yeah it is what are the problems you're right wait we want the antenna super high powered antenna we spent our entire savings on development
[22:21.06]We can only give it to you if you help us market SOL.
[22:24.78]That's easy.
[22:25.12]Take the provided CD launcher and use it to give installation discs to zombies throughout the city.
[22:31.96]We like marketing.
[22:33.08]And we love shooting things.
[22:35.08]I like wearing short pants.
[22:37.28]Would you like to begin driving now?
[22:41.41]Yes.
[22:42.27]Affirmative.
[22:43.47]Initiating augmented reality driving sequence.
[22:50.19]Do the droopy voice.
[22:52.09]Wait, wait, wait.
[22:52.49]Is this pizza?
[22:52.99]Not pizza.
[22:53.61]Pizza man?
[22:54.01]What's the newspaper one?
[22:54.83]Newspaper throw?
[22:55.37]Paper boy.
[22:55.79]There it is.
[22:56.27]Ten zombies.
[22:56.61]Pizza boy.
[22:57.09]Pizza.
[22:57.21]Pizza man.
[22:57.59]Do I have a cursor?
[23:23.30]Um... What's going on?
[23:25.22]Why is my cursor off the screen?
[23:34.83]How do I...?
[23:35.33]Okay, it's right click.
[23:36.47]I'm sitting there driving into him.
[23:48.23]This is newspaper man.
[23:53.41]He said that?
[23:56.37]Did he?
[23:57.57]I was talking to you.
[24:02.41]We cannot be held liable for any injury or loss of life.
[24:07.95]I'm liking the sound of this more and more.
[24:10.49]Please demonstrate the operation of the antenna to our big winner.
[24:15.27]Not too late.
[24:16.03]I don't want to see the bright light again.
[24:19.65]Do the drooping voice.
[24:21.23]Alright.
[24:21.83]I will.
[24:22.15]Oh.
[24:25.46]Oh boy.
[24:27.02]Oh no.
[24:29.32]Boo hoo.
[24:32.88]Got it.
[24:33.16]Alright, so we got the antenna.
[24:35.36]What does this do?
[24:36.04]So we can now... Somebody said, what the fuck is this?
[24:42.25]What?
[24:42.99]Salmon Mac.
[24:43.59]Reinstall something well for once.
[24:45.73]I won't be able to just pull it off.
[24:47.79]Okay, so we got the antenna.
[24:49.95]Let's go... I didn't talk to Stinky.
[24:52.17]Let me make sure I have a conversation with Stinky.
[25:08.53]Now do Garfield.
[25:09.29]Okay.
[25:13.78]Alright, we want to... Well, ever heard of a zombie factory?
[25:16.16]Elves?
[25:43.72]Zombies giving you much trouble, Stinky?
[25:45.66]If that is your real name.
[25:48.28]Oh, no.
[25:49.28]They're a nuisance, but at least they eat quickly and leave.
[25:52.96]Your friend Lincoln is the real horror.
[25:55.18]Hey, it's the voice that I do when I do somebody.
[26:01.00]That's not me.
[26:02.40]Literally almost 90% of people that I do a voice for are sounds like this.
[26:06.28]Zach, what are you looking for?
[26:08.34]Probably you.
[26:12.91]So, have you heard from Grandpa Stinky lately?
[26:16.41]Like, from beyond the grave?
[26:19.87]What are you talking about?
[26:21.64]Grandpa's still on his Himalayan mountain climbing junket.
[26:28.24]I thought you said Grandpa Stinky was on an around-the-world cruise.
[26:31.84]Do Kylo run?
[26:57.25]Okay.
[26:57.69]Give Abe a break.
[26:58.77]Give Abe a break.
[26:59.95]He's on the rebound.
[27:01.29]He keeps trying to pay me in Confederate money.
[27:03.53]Who does that?
[27:04.43]That doesn't even make sense.
[27:09.46]It was pretty nice of Grandpa Stinky to leave his entire restaurant empire to you.
[27:14.08]Some empire?
[27:15.50]Zombies, deadbeat ex-presidents, trivia cheaters.
[27:19.66]Makes me wonder if it was worth the effort.
[27:22.43]If what was worth the effort?
[27:24.31]Oh, nothing.
[27:26.53]Alright, what's going on with the sun lamp?
[27:28.07]What's with the sun lamp, woman who will call Stinky for the sake of convenience?
[27:32.01]So that's what that is.
[27:33.45]Oh, I mean, of course that's what that is.
[27:35.93]I have to look my best, you know.
[27:38.34]Sun lamp.
[27:39.02]The magazine sets such an unrealistic standard of beauty for grandpa murderers.
[27:45.70]Can we have the sun lamp?
[27:46.48]Can we have your sun lamp?
[27:47.80]What could you possibly need it for?
[27:48.96]Did she just admit to killing her father?
[27:50.42]Max needs a UV bulb for his teeth bleaching regimen.
[27:53.10]You think a smile this white comes naturally?
[27:55.28]Teeth bleaching.
[27:57.10]I don't need... I mean, I'm done with it.
[28:01.49]Wait, why do you... What's a beauty doing in a restaurant?
[28:05.11]Did you think the food wasn't hazardous enough without the threat of melanoma?
[28:08.57]Oh, that.
[28:09.61]I was just going through some of the old things Stinky, Grandpa, had in storage.
[28:14.01]I need a big box for packing things that need to be sent away.
[28:17.25]Okay.
[28:21.74]Let's order something.
[28:23.40]Supplies are low because of the zombie attack, so we're probably out.
[28:27.48]You do realize that's not going to stop us, right?
[28:30.62]Go ahead.
[28:32.32]Do you have any enchiladas?
[28:35.35]Crab and salamander enchiladas in green sauce.
[28:38.33]Sal, I want new Dobbs and Greta Van Susteren doing double dutch on the back of a rogue elephant.
[28:45.33]I'd like... What's the special today?
[28:46.69]The special.
[28:47.77]Ah, my special gooey molasses tar cake.
[28:50.21]It's an ancient family recipe.
[28:52.39]Ancient?
[28:53.19]You've heard of the La Brea tar pits, of course.
[28:55.64]But have you ever tasted them?
[28:57.70]Sold.
[28:58.32]I'll take two slices.
[28:59.96]Sorry.
[29:00.90]I used up the blowtorch on some zombies who didn't tip.
[29:03.48]Are we ever going to meet the guy in the back?
[29:05.83]You're welcome to look at it, though.
[29:07.91]Just don't touch.
[29:09.51]Okay.
[29:11.03]So we can take the lamp.
[29:12.68]Let's just see what this does.
[29:13.34]Seared grouper in a maple syrup reduction with bacon-wrapped dates and toffee chips served on a bed of Venezuelan newspaper clippings.
[29:20.88]Sal, number three.
[29:25.40]Chicken chow mein.
[29:25.86]Chicken chow mein with chocolate-covered raisins and a caramel swirl.
[29:29.12]Sal, get me a hyperactive spider monkey and a powder blue cardigan, and why don't we go ahead and wrestle him to the ground and tickle him till he pees?
[29:36.01]I have got to see what goes on in this kitchen.
[29:41.71]Nothing for us, thanks.
[29:44.51]Let's go get the sun.
[29:52.23]Want to help me carry this thing around, Max?
[29:54.47]I just want the bulb.
[29:55.99]Get the bulb.
[29:58.19]Did you just get deja vu?
[30:00.39]Just close your eyes and it'll pass.
[30:04.18]I'm looking over here.
[30:05.80]With 12,000 drop frames in 30 minutes, usually I have like
[30:11.38]Ah, that's so bad.
[30:12.39]12,000 drop frames in 30 minutes is like... 150,000 drop frames for the stream.
[30:14.65]Uhhh... Fuck me.
[30:14.99]Bleh.
[30:49.08]It's alright.
[30:49.92]I'm gonna just relax.
[30:52.98]No, no, no, no, no.
[30:54.52]Just relax.
[30:55.14]It's gonna pass.
[30:56.44]It'll pass.
[30:56.98]In like 30, 20 minutes or so, it's gonna pass and we'll be fine.
[31:09.93]Do your breathing.
[31:10.65]I'm trying to do my breathing.
[31:13.07]So we have a... We have a lightbulb.
[31:21.01]2% calm!
[31:22.35]He's gonna start crying.
[31:27.90]Yeah, it's just very distracting.
[31:46.16]Okay, I'm fine.
[31:49.03]It's closed.
[31:50.07]Bosco went into hiding when we convinced him, T-H-E-M, we're coming.
[31:55.34]Bosco's not available anymore?
[32:01.60]Wait, that's not true.
[32:03.26]I can't talk to Bosco?
[32:04.88]It's closed.
[32:10.45]It's getting worse.
[32:14.57]I need positive breathing!
[32:27.35]Jerma, call Jerma.
[32:28.39]He's crying.
[32:32.03]Alright, so what can I do with the bulb?
[32:36.96]It's the UV bulb from Stinky Sun Lamp.
[32:39.66]Can I put that onto zombies?
[32:48.20]Six seconds in, six seconds out.
[32:49.88]Six seconds in, six seconds out.
[32:54.56]I'm not sure quite where I'd stick it.
[33:02.65]I thought like... I thought starting early was supposed to prevent the internet problems.
[33:07.93]It usually starts later.
[33:08.87]At least the last, like, week it has.
[33:12.05]Okay, let's go into Sybil's.
[33:25.12]Hey, Sybil!
[33:29.44]No, it's him.
[33:30.08]He's back.
[33:30.42]You got nothing.
[34:04.78]That's it.
[34:05.42]He's got nothing.
[34:10.76]Harry Molman.
[34:12.50]Last time we saw you, you were... Yeah, yeah, on the moon.
[34:16.48]What's all this I keep hearing about zombie attacks?
[34:19.30]They're everywhere!
[34:20.86]You boys have guns, right?
[34:23.49]Are we just not getting through to these people?
[34:26.03]Yeah, we're really not that complicated, Harry.
[34:30.79]How's the suitor business?
[34:32.01]How are things going with you and Sybil?
[34:34.07]Oh, she's playing hard to get.
[34:36.56]But women have a hard time resisting my charms.
[34:39.84]Oh, she'll grow to love me.
[34:58.49]I'm sorry guys.
[34:59.97]There's nothing I can do.
[35:03.41]What do I do?
[35:04.60]What do I do about it?
[35:06.02]You know?
[35:06.36]It's alright.
[35:08.60]What do I do?
[35:09.32]Nice spam chat.
[35:13.02]Very cool.
[35:17.61]Coxie Pasta.
[35:21.72]I'm hoping that it just stops.
[35:24.32]But right now, it's... It's almost like I shouldn't play this until it does stop.
[35:28.08]Like, it's almost like I should just turn the webcam on and fucking smile at you.
[35:33.23]Until, like, it's certain that I'm not gonna drop 20 fucking thousand frames.
[35:44.03]We'll see.
[35:44.41]If this goes on for, like, another 20 minutes or so, I'm gonna have to... We'll have to do something else.
[35:48.09]Because it really is... This is getting to be just unbearable.
[35:51.85]I hate to break it to you, Harry, but Sybil's not that into you.
[35:55.15]She's more into the whole hard rock scene.
[35:58.01]Just wait till she gets a load of my oboe.
[36:01.56]Was that clumsy innuendo or a pathetic attempt to sound cool?
[36:05.42]Both.
[36:08.30]And you have no shot... Do you really think you have a chance with Sybil?
[36:11.54]I'm in it to win it!
[36:13.24]Ha-ha!
[36:17.65]Alright, do you know anything about the zombie factory?
[36:18.86]Do you know anything about a zombie factory?
[36:21.02]Zombies don't make things.
[36:23.10]They break them.
[36:24.66]No, it's a factory that makes zombies.
[36:27.02]Inconceivable.
[36:28.64]That's like making hate and evil and awfulness.
[36:32.40]So you're saying you don't like zombies.
[36:37.69]Oh, okay.
[36:39.15]What have you got against zombies?
[36:40.71]Disgusting creatures.
[36:42.37]They're always breaking things.
[36:44.33]Zombies are why we can't have nice things.
[36:50.16]Zombies, why?
[36:50.50]Zombies break things?
[36:51.40]The reason we don't like zombies is that they break things?
[36:54.16]Yes!
[36:55.18]Stupid, clumsy undead.
[36:57.07]And that bothers you more than the brain-eating?
[36:59.79]They're hell on knick-knacks.
[37:03.73]What are we, still doing prismatology?
[37:04.75]Are you still into prismatology?
[37:06.33]Oh, no.
[37:07.51]Between the four of us, I wasn't that into it in the first place.
[37:10.75]You just relocated to the moon for it.
[37:13.95]Well, think how great Docent looks on a resume.
[37:18.96]You just relocated to the moon.
[37:21.78]What do you have to notice?
[37:22.40]That's Marge.
[37:22.80]That was like a peaked Mike scream.
[37:52.87]Alright, anything in here besides talking to Sybil?
[37:54.49]Let's see.
[37:58.90]It makes me feel like I'm in a deli.
[38:00.92]I am not a piece of meat!
[38:05.80]What gives, Sybil?
[38:06.88]Did you start your dating service again?
[38:08.88]Not quite.
[38:10.26]All my clients are applying for dates with me.
[38:13.40]Um, as kind of officers of the law, we have to point out that that's kind of illegal.
[38:17.66]Does that mean we can shoot her to regain health points or something?
[38:21.20]What?
[38:21.94]No.
[38:22.64]Get your heads out of the gutter.
[38:24.10]It's not like that.
[38:26.08]I'm looking for my soulmate.
[38:31.36]How are you going to do that?
[38:32.26]How are you going to find your soulmate?
[38:33.98]Not by jumping in with the first reanimated statue that comes along.
[38:38.18]That's for sure.
[38:39.88]I've got the initial screening, and then rigorous interviews, and finally, the soulmater.
[38:47.49]I want it.
[38:50.63]A soul mater?
[38:52.13]What does the soul mater do?
[38:53.73]Not sure.
[38:54.57]I won it in an online auction and the instructions are all in Sanskrit.
[38:59.43]Something about ripping souls from across the plains to reunite them with corruptible mortal vessels.
[39:06.27]Doesn't that sound romantic?
[39:08.92]I could just die.
[39:10.80]Sounds like a very real possibility.
[39:15.24]You can still clearly tell who that is.
[39:18.25]All you did is, you just, you just gave, like, Abraham Lincoln Batman eyes.
[39:23.05]You just made him Batman.
[39:29.70]Alright, do you know anything about the zombies?
[39:30.66]Do you know anything about a place called the Zombie Factory?
[39:33.52]Zombies?
[39:34.74]Where?
[39:35.84]Hmm.
[39:37.28]Irrational fear of zombies.
[39:40.00]Now do a Batman impression.
[39:41.16]Interesting.
[39:42.02]But yes, I did get an email about something like that from some friends in Europe into the whole equal rights for the undead thing.
[39:48.50]I'm sorry, that sucked.
[39:49.06]I can't remember where exactly.
[40:00.92]Sorry, my mind is elsewhere right now.
[40:07.35]That was a pretty good Batman impression from where my brain is at.
[40:13.61]Can we get the Soul Mater?
[40:14.55]Okay.
[40:29.92]Have you had a lot of applicants?
[40:31.58]A few.
[40:32.42]If you know anybody, anybody else, of course, send them my way.
[40:36.28]A lot of these guys have no chance, but I'm still interviewing them to be polite.
[40:42.52]Speaking of which, what kind of movies do you like, Harry?
[40:45.60]No, I don't go to the movies that much because of my astigmatism.
[40:52.12]Wait.
[40:54.19]Why couldn't you go to the movie?
[41:03.80]It's nice knowing you, chat.
[41:05.20]Wait, what?
[41:05.46]Oh, man.
[41:05.66]Am I still alive?
[41:31.33]That was a full-on zero.
[41:32.57]Hello?
[41:34.25]We... That was a zero for like three straight seconds.
[41:47.26]My blood is heating up.
[41:48.64]It's starting to get hot in here.
[42:02.70]Six seconds in, six seconds out.
[42:04.54]Six seconds in, six seconds out.
[42:06.98]This is not like a walkie-talkie.
[42:08.83]It's like the fucking internet.
[42:11.71]You know what I mean?
[42:12.97]Like... Over and out.
[42:14.47]Sorry.
[42:29.87]I have to address the story next... Sorry, didn't get that one.
[42:37.86]Over.
[42:41.16]We have to... Not much time.
[42:49.33]Don't you want to give Abe another chance?
[42:51.44]Abe who?
[42:52.58]You were telling me more about yourself, Harry.
[42:55.78]I was detailing my various prescriptions and inhalers, if I remember correctly.
[43:01.89]Yeah, I'm just driving around through tunnels.
[43:07.95]Streaming from my laptop.
[43:09.37]Just hold on, guys.
[43:10.81]Yeah, I'm playing Shaman Max.
[43:13.66]I hired an Uber driver to drive me through a tunnel back and forth.
[43:31.24]Yeah, we just went through one.
[43:33.63]We just went through another tunnel.
[43:34.77]Are we good?
[43:37.55]How are you?
[43:45.59]That seems like a waste of money.
[43:48.88]Kind of like most North American internet.
[44:10.02]LOL, dude!
[44:12.32]Plus 40!
[44:18.72]Good luck finding your soulmate.
[44:21.06]Well, hold on.
[44:30.75]I can't.
[44:31.13]I can't, guys.
[44:32.01]I'm sorry.
[44:32.47]We're gonna have to just hang out on camera.
[44:36.66]This is... 13% of the stream has been unwatchable.
[44:42.18]So it really is like... Every se- It's just not... I don't want- I- I- I wanna like enjoy it.
[44:47.96]I don't wanna have to keep... Cause there's a lot of dialog.
[44:50.74]You know what I mean?
[44:52.42]There's a shitload of dialog... That I don't- I don't want it to be like walkie-talkie cutout, drop down to zero.
[44:58.35]So... I'm sorry, unfortunately, that we have to change to do something else for a little while.
[45:10.08]This is the worst it's been since it started having problems again, like last week.
[45:14.76]So, sorry everybody.
[45:15.72]I really do apologize.
[45:19.04]I'm not going to let it get me annoyed or angry if for some reason we get green again in the next 20 minutes or so.
[45:25.25]I'm just hanging out.
[45:35.48]Why is it always me and not other streamers?
[45:37.36]What?
[45:38.44]So many streamers deal with internet problems.
[45:40.74]What do you mean?
[45:41.46]I'm the only streamer you've ever seen with internet issues?
[45:45.23]That's pretty rare.
[45:46.31]Alright, let me just go like this.
[46:02.11]You're the only streamer I've ever seen.
[46:07.91]Nova's been fucked lately?
[46:08.97]Yeah, I heard about that too.
[46:20.46]Call tech support on stream?
[46:21.58]They don't do anything.
[46:24.94]Me calling tech support on stream would be funny for five seconds, and then we would realize, oh, they're just going to tell me to turn my router off.
[46:33.18]I'm just gonna ping your router, and maybe that'll work.
[46:39.96]It's gonna turn you off for a couple of minutes.
[46:53.53]Well, let's, um... Well, I don't know, what am I gonna do now?
[46:57.90]Let's go like this.
[46:59.26]Hey!
[47:04.72]I'm just gonna have a huge facecam right now.
[47:14.73]Angry streamer?
[47:15.61]No, it's more defeated.
[47:17.87]It's defeated streamer.
[47:19.12]It's a little different.
[47:23.78]He is Abe Lincoln.
[47:29.68]Let's talk about stream ideas.
[47:34.22]Yeah, I gotta change this.
[47:35.84]If you're looking for Sam and Max, we'll do it again.
[47:40.55]Maybe even later, in like a little bit, once we'll try to get this to go through here.
[47:49.93]Hold on.
[47:51.05]Let me just say... What do I even title this stream right now?
[48:00.30]Frames...
[48:02.54]are depleting frames are depleting transformer maybe I don't know I'm I'm kind of a little pissy right now I don't know if I would be like I don't think I could do it I'm like a little pissy right now I don't know if I could get in there and be like okay let's have fun I'm like I'm kind of pissy
