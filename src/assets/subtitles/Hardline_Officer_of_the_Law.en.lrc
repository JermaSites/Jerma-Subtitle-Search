[00:03.04]Siri.
[00:04.28]How may I help you?
[00:05.96]Kill Jerma.
[00:07.90]I don't know what that means.
[00:09.76]If you like, I can search the web for Kill Jerma.
[00:13.48]Yeah, okay, yeah, that's perfect.
[00:14.76]Tell me what you got.
[00:16.75]Checking my sources.
[00:18.23]Here's what I found on the web for how do you choke somebody really hard.
[00:24.87]I'm an officer of the law.
[00:25.89]Put your hands up.
[00:27.03]You're coming in with me.
[00:28.45]Oh, this guy's going crazy.
[00:29.59]He's out of control.
[00:30.37]I can't stop him.
[00:33.13]Tell me where they are!
[00:34.41]Tell me where they are!
[00:35.83]Tell me where they are!
[00:37.73]Suspect is unconscious.
[00:40.07]You really do just drive off of walls.
[00:42.85]See?
[00:43.17]This is so stupid!
[00:45.92]Why can't you just like- It doesn't even fucking- See, I told you!
[00:48.56]This just looks so stupid!
[00:50.66]Why can't you just bounce off of walls on a motorcycle?
[00:53.30]Oh, watch out for the helicopter.
[00:56.08]It's pretty good underground strats.
[00:57.78]I guess I'm gonna be the one to say it.
[00:59.20]This- This is just a worse version of tactical intervention.
[01:03.42]Uh, I seriously can't even aim at anyone.
[01:05.92]All this- I'm dead.
[01:07.60]Are you?
[01:07.90]I can't even tell my camera's going crazy.
[01:10.08]I'm dead.
[01:12.22]Okay.
[01:18.46]Put your hands up.
[01:19.56]I'm an officer of the law.
[01:21.00]This is now under the precinct of cop- I'm under- I'm in control here.
[01:26.43]Holy shit.
[01:27.21]Holy shit!
[01:30.11]I can't spawn on my head.
[01:47.56]Okay, people that are passing us are gonna be like, what the fuck are these guys doing?
[01:52.82]Get the fuck outta here!
[01:54.82]Don't you know I got a boat?
[01:56.59]Why would you ever use a car again?
[01:58.99]Yeah, especially considering this thing has this thing has a minigun on top.
[02:03.73]I know.
[02:04.45]You're just driving the boat on like the highway.
[02:07.85]It's pretty fast.
[02:09.98]Now we're hitting this jump.
[02:12.00]Hit the jump.
[02:13.36]Are you wide enough?
[02:17.66]Physics!
[02:18.68]We did it.
[02:28.15]I'm so sorry, teammate.
[02:30.49]That shit has never happened before.
[02:34.25]You saw all the weird stuff bikes do?
[02:36.07]That's like impossible.
[02:39.91]There's a zipline.
[02:41.39]I... I don't... I have to kill someone with this, right?
[02:47.02]Putting up a zipline.
[02:54.88]Yeah, that's the best gun in the game.
[02:58.88]And apparently, even the shitty zipline multiplies your speed by like 200 times.
[03:04.80]I don't know why people are still making cars when there's boats and there's ziplines.
[03:09.25]Like, why isn't Toyota out of business?
[03:11.63]You sure this is a regular boat?
[03:13.49]It looks like a regular boat to me.
[03:15.21]Mm-hmm.
[03:15.81]It looks kind of like a regular boat.
[03:18.47]Let's see if it's land-worthy.
[03:20.45]Is it also a let-no?
[03:22.95]Insta-stopped.
[03:24.64]No.
[03:30.08]Trying to run from me.
[03:37.95]I know where you're going.
[03:38.71]Everybody always goes up here anyway.
[03:40.87]All your friends are probably up there.
[03:42.23]You throw a flash, climb the ladder, don't look.
[03:49.79]You're blind.
[03:51.31]You're blind.
[03:52.11]Dudes over there weren't even hit by it.
[04:04.88]They're just actually blind people.
[04:07.32]They don't know to turn around.
[04:09.44]Thank you.
[04:14.09]I'm an officer of the law.
[04:16.25]You're under arrest.
[04:17.35]Damn it.
[04:20.34]I said I'm an officer of the law.
[04:22.06]I said I'm an officer of the law.
[04:25.82]Get... Come.
[04:29.50]GET HIM!
[04:32.50]GET HIM!
[04:33.96]AHH HA!
[04:34.78]OH GOD!
[04:48.90]No, don't kill me!
[04:49.52]I'm laughing at something!
[04:51.90]Don't kill- Oh, come on!
[04:52.90]He was sitting on the roof!
[04:54.64]Come on!
[04:58.00]Here's the strategy.
[04:59.12]We go with non-lethal.
[05:00.30]We flash him out, we blind him, we take him in, bring him into custody.
[05:06.21]Fuck.
[05:07.21]Oh wait, he's a cop anyway.
[05:08.97]I'm the criminal.
[05:10.07]Never mind.
[05:13.79]You fly this thing.
[05:17.54]That was, like, such a smooth way to go tell someone to die in a fire.
[05:24.70]I sneeze, and then I kill a man.
[05:28.54]He's dead.
[05:30.18]I didn't feel nothing.
[05:33.27]I pulled that trigger before.
[05:35.69]Yeah, I'm just on the guy.
[05:37.69]I'm the guy on the roof.
[05:38.51]I'm sorry.
[05:39.81]Tell me where they are!
[05:46.34]No, Jerma.
[05:47.18]You're not in this part.
[05:48.58]I'm shooting people.
[05:49.96]I'm on a distress call.
[05:51.65]There's people inside that motel, and they're expecting to be saved by my bullets.
[05:56.11]Dude, you need to calm the fuck down.
[05:58.75]What the hell are you talking about?
[05:59.81]This is the clip where I actually just play the game.
[06:01.98]You're freaking me out.
[06:02.84]You're freaking out my dog, too.
[06:05.30]No.
[06:05.58]Do you hear him?
[06:06.32]No, shut up.
[06:08.18]Hey you, you're under arrest!
[06:09.22]You over there, you're under arrest!
[06:11.18]You too, you're under arrest!
[06:13.08]Yep, you're the same guy, I already told you, I read you your rights.
[06:16.59]Oh my god, I can't get out of this corner!
[06:18.19]There's like a med kit that was preventing me from getting out of the corner.
[06:22.35]Oh.
[06:26.31]I'm getting a lot of points for this.
[06:28.89]I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna sit quietly and... get my internet points.
[06:37.08]I'm listening to the radio.
[06:38.00]I think we're getting shot at.
[06:44.05]You okay?
[06:46.09]Oh, I got a perk because I've been doing so well.
[06:49.23]Uh, you could kill, you know, everybody on a roof, or you could sit in the passenger seat of a car and get triple the points.
[06:57.56]I think our car's gonna blow up.
[07:01.56]Yes, I'm the bank manager and I want to know what's going on in my facilities.
[07:05.61]Actually, you're a cop.
[07:06.39]You're dressed like a cop, so we should do this as if you were a cop.
[07:09.57]I'll re-enter, and you're going to be a cop.
[07:11.85]He's your assistant.
[07:13.55]Alright, assistant.
[07:15.21]Hi.
[07:15.53]Um...
