[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.66]Hello.
[00:06.62]How are you?
[00:07.86]Good to see you.
[00:08.30]Uh, you know, I was supposed to be live like 10 minutes ago, but I, uh, all, like, the Twitch stuff, I lost all my connections with all the stuff that I had connected.
[00:21.83]So, my, like, streaming service stuff that I use, I had to, like, re-log in.
[00:26.51]So, fuck!
[00:28.03]How you doing?
[00:34.30]Oh, here he is.
[00:35.67]First stream since the leaks.
[00:37.51]We have to hear what he has to say.
[00:39.17]Well, first of all, I'll tell you, I was just as surprised as probably maybe a lot of you were.
[00:47.09]I did not think that I was in that category.
[00:49.05]I just really didn't.
[00:51.85]When I saw that list, I was like, holy shit, wow, look at these top 100 fucking streamers.
[00:56.41]And they make a shitload of money.
[00:58.13]I wonder where I am.
[00:59.04]I'm 98.
[00:59.18]What?
[00:59.36]Wait, how?
[01:00.66]What?
[01:00.88]How?
[01:01.04]How?
[01:03.38]I was very surprised.
[01:07.34]He's a billionaire.
[01:08.66]No, no, no.
[01:09.74]I'm not going to... Look, I'm not going to touch too much upon this.
[01:13.83]You guys... I try to be transparent with money with you guys.
[01:16.87]Hopefully, I have been.
[01:18.15]Now you know exactly the amount of money that I have taken in from twitch.tv in the last two plus years.
[01:27.82]And whatever.
[01:28.26]I'm just going to keep using it.
[01:29.20]That's all there is to it.
[01:34.82]number 98 pay back your debt the debt's like billions I only have whatever it was I don't even have that by the way that's over the last two two years and one month two months I've been using it I don't even have it I don't even have any money
[01:55.88]No, I'm going to make a really clear statement on this.
[02:03.28]Don't ever give this channel money unless you absolutely can afford to.
[02:08.83]There's literally no reason for you to give this channel more than a sub ever.
[02:13.29]I just want to make that really clear.
[02:15.25]I hope that people don't think they have to give this channel money.
[02:19.48]Hopefully I've been clear on that the last five years or so.
[02:22.76]And I know I don't want to even, I don't want to talk about this too much because I know anytime you talk about like money, here come like a bunch of primes.
[02:29.23]I don't want, that's not what this is for.
[02:31.29]I'm not even going to address them.
[02:33.81]But I'm just going to keep trying to do what I can and
[02:38.01]use it on the stream use it on me too right like I want to make sure that because there's another thing that's really worth bringing up too is I mean I don't know how long this is going to last I don't think anybody does so I want to make sure that if I'm going to make this kind of money I want to have like investments and put it into like accounts that are going to like be okay in five to ten years because I have no idea how long this is going to last but there are far other people
[03:09.22]on this platform that are not in the top 100, top 200, that you should probably be giving your sub to every month.
[03:15.84]It's probably not me anymore.
[03:17.98]Let's be honest, right?
[03:22.48]But, I could talk about this for like another four hours.
[03:30.97]Invest in a proper e-clown car.
[03:33.81]For a second, I thought you said proper e-clown.
[03:35.43]Alright, Etalyx is waiting.
[03:36.71]Let me say hello.
[03:39.90]Hey, sorry, I forgot that I haven't addressed the leak since I streamed last night.
[03:45.44]It happened like in the middle of the week.
[03:49.79]Yeah, the leak.
[03:52.59]The leak.
[03:54.77]What, being like a top 30,000 streamer?
[03:59.07]Just making a casual average minimum wage on Twitch?
[04:02.79]What's there to reveal?
[04:03.73]Alright, we're playing Far Cry 6 today!
[04:13.13]This is Etalyx.
[04:13.79]You don't know who he is?
[04:15.25]How could you not at this point?
[04:17.81]Everybody knows who I am because they're real viewers and gamers.
[04:23.55]I think we're already in the game, right?
[04:25.43]Yeah, we are in the game.
[04:28.93]I have to run ads?
[04:29.87]No, I'm not going to run ads.
[04:31.71]You understand now?
[04:32.75]Do you guys get it?
[04:34.12]Maybe he should start running ads.
[04:36.62]Give us ads, Jerma.
[04:38.98]Are you serious?
[04:39.92]Why would I do that?
[04:42.28]There's a bunch of people in your chat saying who right now.
[04:45.74]Did you tell them to wear their name tags to the stream today?
[04:49.30]Well, you have your name tag on.
[04:53.22]Sometimes I feel like I have to wear a name tag.
[04:54.64]I feel like they don't know who I am.
[05:00.58]Alright, let's go.
[05:01.90]Did I even tweet this?
[05:04.97]Okay, I'm just going to retweet yours, because I'm incredibly lazy.
[05:09.45]Wow.
[05:10.89]There, that's it.
[05:11.33]There we go.
[05:12.07]See?
[05:12.77]I was just talking about how professional we were, like doing the whole tutorial before the stream even started.
[05:16.53]Yeah, but I mean, that's something you have to do in these games.
[05:19.45]And by the way, people were curious about the title.
[05:22.25]I've never sat through an entire Far Cry game.
[05:24.13]I walk out of the movie in the first act, and I keep seeing the sequels.
[05:28.20]I don't know why we keep doing this,
[05:30.44]We go to the Far Cry movie.
[05:32.92]We get up and leave the movie.
[05:34.50]And you, like, effectively showed up late.
[05:37.15]And I don't mean that as a stream joke.
[05:38.89]I mean, like, you got into the seat.
[05:41.07]You crawled over.
[05:41.61]The lights are already off.
[05:43.03]You skipped all the cut scenes to get here.
[05:44.51]I gotta, like, explain the plot.
[05:46.54]Yeah, I actually truly have no fucking idea what's going on, because he did the tutorial last night, and I was unaware that, well, he told me, but I just didn't do it, because, you know, I'm busy.
[05:58.60]So he did the tutorial last night, it's about an hour, and he's like, hey, did you do the tutorial yet?
[06:04.82]And I'm like, no, it's like, can I get through it in like an hour?
[06:07.48]And he's like, yeah, there's a bunch of cutscenes though.
[06:09.74]So I'm not kidding.
[06:10.72]I wish I had it recorded.
[06:12.52]I sprinted through every single thing.
[06:14.42]I mashed space bar to skip every single cutscene.
[06:17.40]I don't even know how to crouch.
[06:18.76]I have no idea.
[06:19.30]I just, I held shift the whole time.
[06:23.26]But anyways, this is our first segment is like a stealth section too.
[06:26.77]I just sprint.
[06:27.51]I went right through it.
[06:29.19]I just ran through it.
[06:29.87]Stephanie said, I thought you were done playing Ubisoft games.
[06:35.70]Uh... This isn't an Ubisoft game.
[06:38.50]This is Far Cry.
[06:41.36]It's the same game every time.
[06:42.98]We already played Far Cry 4 and 5, so you can rest assured, this is no different.
[06:48.54]Yeah, but why do we keep going to the movie?
[06:50.30]This is like you ha- Okay.
[06:51.54]So, again, let's- If Far Cry was a movie, and you and I went to the movie together, and after like 30 minutes of that movie, we were like, I'm fucking leaving.
[07:00.04]This movie sucks.
[07:01.33]Right?
[07:01.79]And we leave the movie.
[07:04.06]Why do we keep going to the sequels?
[07:05.78]Oh, hey, dude, Far Cry 5 just came out.
[07:08.18]We didn't really care that much, and we just goofed around for three hours in the first.
[07:12.00]Why do we keep going to the monstrous sequels and leaving?
[07:14.90]It's like Boss Baby.
[07:16.44]You don't watch the whole movie, Boss Baby.
[07:18.54]You watch like 30 seconds, and then you skip like 10 minutes, and then you watch like 30 more seconds.
[07:23.30]This is what we're doing with all these movies, trying to see what happens.
[07:26.43]Oh, you're talking about the skip through the movie thing.
[07:29.11]Yeah, I love doing that.
[07:29.67]I think you have to talk to this person.
[07:36.04]We need to talk.
[07:36.66]Because this is your game, not mine.
[07:40.95]I accept.
[07:41.33]Hey, hit that slave camp hard.
[07:45.25]Okay.
[07:45.45]I thought she was going to shoot you.
[07:48.47]She was aiming it at you for a second.
[07:52.00]Okay.
[07:52.18]Where do we go?
[07:52.74]I have no idea what's going on, dude.
[07:54.36]I have absolutely no idea what's happening.
[07:55.48]I don't know who that person is.
[07:56.94]The very first, like...
[07:59.37]thing anybody hears in the game is go hit that slave camp hard that you know that's exactly what we're gonna do let's go I don't even know I don't even know where we are alright let's go you could probably like just I I don't honestly wait we haven't we have an alligator remember that
[08:22.78]We do, yes.
[08:23.58]We have two alligators.
[08:24.72]And you can press E on the alligator.
[08:27.69]Isn't that so cute?
[08:29.57]You feed alligator.
[08:31.65]I already did this.
[08:34.07]You dropped like a ham sandwich in his mouth.
[08:39.92]I want to do that to mine, too.
[08:47.02]I was just trying to cook the steak.
[08:50.04]I was just trying to cook the steak.
[08:51.60]What the hell are you doing?
[08:54.10]It was just going to be like a cooked steak joke.
[08:59.08]I don't know.
[08:59.42]I don't know.
[08:59.82]Alright, let's go.
[09:00.72]Can we do a mission?
[09:01.38]Can we start the game?
[09:02.48]Even though I already did, I don't know what's going on.
[09:05.57]Yeah, welcome guys.
[09:06.19]This is Far Cry 6.
[09:11.29]How come you run faster than me?
[09:13.90]Hold on.
[09:15.10]First bug.
[09:16.68]First bug?
[09:18.02]First bug.
[09:19.74]Oh, I thought you were talking about like a beetle or something.
[09:21.93]No, do you see this person?
[09:24.03]I don't see anybody.
[09:25.47]She is flying like a T-posing Jesus in my game.
[09:30.49]I don't see that.
[09:30.97]Hovering like five feet off.
[09:33.25]I see a gun just sitting here.
[09:36.03]It's just a floating gun.
[09:37.15]Can you get on the horse?
[09:39.91]Don't please put it away.
[09:44.16]Can you get- No, I don't- Okay, alright.
[09:45.70]Look, we have to at least get on the road.
[09:47.26]Okay, you need your own horse.
[09:55.18]Just get a little further downhill.
[09:56.34]I can jump on that.
[09:58.10]Wait, what if you get on the zip line and then land on me?
[09:59.76]Easy.
[10:04.55]I can't.
[10:05.33]Hold on.
[10:05.61]Go.
[10:05.71]That's so stupid.
[10:07.47]Run as asshole!
[10:08.87]Holy shit!
[10:09.63]Oh my god, that was horrible.
[10:10.97]Are you alright?
[10:12.75]Yeah, I'm good.
[10:13.55]Alright, so we're going this way.
[10:19.47]So there's horses in this game.
[10:20.79]Why does this feel like it's like 10 FOV?
[10:23.55]It's going to make me want to puke.
[10:24.95]I already changed it.
[10:28.39]You're probably going to get leashed back to me.
[10:30.37]You can only be so far from me.
[10:31.82]I have to keep the backpack with the child maul leash.
[10:39.90]Are you really that far away?
[10:45.58]I gotta turn the FOV up.
[10:49.35]It's at like 95.
[10:50.61]I have it so high already.
[10:55.03]It's at 95.
[10:55.95]Should I put it at like 100?
[10:58.79]110.
[10:58.87]I think it's just like small on the horse.
[11:02.69]I think when you get on the horse, it just zooms in to like a nauseating level.
[11:05.87]Maybe it does.
[11:06.65]Okay.
[11:07.13]Alright, so we need to go meet Julio.
[11:11.55]Driving FOV is forced FOV.
[11:13.11]Ah, okay.
[11:13.41]I see.
[11:20.20]I gotta find like a vehicle.
[11:22.12]Otherwise we're gonna have to walk everywhere.
[11:23.94]Well, I'm already there.
[11:24.78]Oh.
[11:27.34]I'm coming.
[11:27.98]Characters like get tired in this Far Cry.
[11:30.44]I ran him over.
[11:37.35]I can't talk to this person though.
[11:38.63]This is your game.
[11:40.65]You're just passing through.
[11:41.63]Can the alligator attack him?
[11:47.34]I got here way before you did.
[11:50.37]Yeah, because I had to walk the whole way.
[11:52.26]Alright, I'm coming.
[11:58.48]Wait, what?
[11:59.08]Hold?
[11:59.50]I had it on toggle.
[12:00.58]What is this bullshit?
[12:04.69]I did.
[12:05.03]I swear to God.
[12:11.53]What the fuck?
[12:14.67]Where is it?
[12:15.95]Okay, there are so many options in this game.
[12:19.30]How long did it take you to actually sit here and go through each one of these?
[12:24.04]I didn't.
[12:24.36]I just turned off motion blur.
[12:28.12]What are you changing right now?
[12:30.09]I don't like to hold aim down sights.
[12:32.70]really you toggle yeah toggle gamer because I don't the pressure with my body yes the pressure on my middle finger hurts what do you use middle finger middle finger is right that's right click this for middle mouse button I'm just kidding I don't use that either I was gonna say what are you talking about alright will you talk to this guy finally listen I'm not going to you I wanted to do this alone but Clara gave me an order
[12:57.86]I can handle myself.
[12:59.14]Is there a punch?
[13:00.56]So, Carlita, he should be here right now, but instead, I get you.
[13:05.00]And I'm supposed to be in Miami, but instead... His health bar.
[13:09.16]I'm stuck here with you.
[13:10.48]He can't die, can he?
[13:12.83]Enough talk.
[13:13.93]Step one, we hit the tobacco.
[13:16.41]Step two, we destroy their poison supply.
[13:19.89]Step three, we get the fuck out of there, and Castillo gets a nice, pretty message from Liverpool.
[13:25.01]He uses toggle.
[13:25.83]Yes, I do.
[13:26.85]What?
[13:29.97]Now I get the horse.
[13:31.01]That's alright.
[13:36.25]He's like running after you.
[13:37.41]He's like, what are you doing?
[13:38.77]Wait, you just teleported over here?
[13:41.05]Wait, what happened?
[13:42.09]Why is he choking?
[13:43.51]What's he choking on?
[13:47.24]What did he eat?
[13:47.86]Alright, let's go.
[13:52.34]Leave the horse.
[13:53.26]We're just doing all the same jokes from the last one.
[13:56.92]We're watching the same movie.
[13:59.88]It's okay to do the same jokes because we're watching the same movie.
[14:03.02]He's waiting for me.
[14:03.86]I don't know.
[14:04.34]Where's the farm?
[14:06.14]I don't know.
[14:06.42]You killed him.
[14:07.10]You screwed everything up, I think.
[14:10.05]Okay, here we go.
[14:13.75]So what do we have to do?
[14:17.63]He gave me some gloves.
[14:18.97]He gave me oven mitts.
[14:20.70]Alright, suit up with that gear.
[14:21.54]Alright.
[14:25.77]Pretty sick.
[14:26.33]Alright, what do we got?
[14:27.35]We need, uh, different gloves.
[14:29.01]How does this even work?
[14:31.05]Hazmat?
[14:31.53]I think I got it on.
[14:39.33]There it is.
[14:39.65]Come on.
[14:46.46]Alright, did you do the how to change gear tutorial?
[14:49.02]No, yeah, I did it already.
[14:49.84]Um, oh, here it is.
[14:51.72]You're not wearing the gloves.
[14:52.64]Let's put them on.
[14:53.38]There you go.
[14:55.47]That's the first time I've seen the inside of the fucking menu.
[15:00.29]Wait, what is that there for?
[15:01.17]Alright, are you ready?
[15:01.83]Let's go get like a car or something.
[15:03.11]I don't want to walk 700 miles.
[15:04.43]We have to follow him?
[15:06.02]It says follow him, so I think you go walk near him.
[15:08.88]Oh, okay.
[15:09.24]But don't run him over though.
[15:20.50]Is this the walk and talk?
[15:23.87]It probably is.
[15:24.55]We actually do get a flamethrower.
[15:26.45]That's pretty crazy.
[15:26.97]Okay, the horse is just... I wish I had one.
[15:41.18]Why?
[15:41.40]Because then you can do this?
[15:43.44]Oh my god!
[15:44.50]Poor challenge completed.
[15:46.04]Ubisoft Connect XP earned.
[15:57.59]That's way too huge of a notification.
[15:59.83]He's almost dead.
[16:01.41]Did I do that?
[16:02.21]Yes.
[16:04.11]What happens if he dies, though?
[16:09.08]We probably have to restart it, so let's actually try to just get through the first co-op mission.
[16:14.72]That's a quarter of the screen.
[16:17.16]Jeremy's going to shoot and kill the NPC.
[16:18.80]No, I'm not.
[16:19.52]He is.
[16:21.06]He has proven already that he's the one doing that this screen.
[16:25.24]I haven't killed anybody yet.
[16:26.51]He's still alive.
[16:27.27]You killed him.
[16:27.77]I had to revive him.
[16:28.95]He was just down.
[16:29.97]That wasn't dead.
[16:31.93]That's why he still got half health.
[16:33.61]Don't we have cell phone cameras?
[16:37.47]I actually can't fit the horse through here.
[16:46.21]Get over here.
[16:46.71]Alright.
[16:47.69]Horse is getting abandoned.
[16:51.67]Okay.
[16:54.08]So we need to follow him up to the top.
[16:57.61]Yeah, but like what happens if you shoot him while he's on the ladder?
[16:59.75]I don't know.
[17:00.07]He's probably gonna fall off.
[17:00.79]I don't want to craft anything, by the way.
[17:02.17]I don't even like... Uh-oh.
[17:07.31]Hang on.
[17:07.55]There's crafting in this game?
[17:08.91]Of course there is.
[17:11.30]See the Vivero tobacco and the yellow poison tanks?
[17:15.52]Okay, so we have to scout.
[17:19.13]By the way, what kind of iPhone is this, where they can get this clear of an image zooming in this much?
[17:25.57]It's the kind, like, okay, so, for context, your side character dies when a boat gets shot full of holes, and they drown.
[17:35.57]Oh, okay.
[17:36.43]But on the beach, the first thing they do is say, give me my phone, and it's still working, even though they just, like, washed up on the shore.
[17:42.71]That's like a super phone.
[17:48.97]Hit me.
[17:49.81]Are you scanning right now?
[17:51.25]Yeah.
[17:51.91]I'm just looking around at stuff.
[17:54.22]I don't know how to do that.
[17:55.10]It still says, oh, hit X. How do I know that and you don't?
[17:58.20]Oh, because I pushed, like, the other phone button.
[18:05.14]There's no way you get that kind of image from this one.
[18:07.34]Are you fucking kidding me?
[18:11.20]When I, like, zoom in to take a picture of a bee at one foot away, it's still kind of blurry.
[18:16.29]Are you kidding me?
[18:17.21]Alright, well, whatever.
[18:17.83]He went down already, man.
[18:25.40]It's a video game, Jeremy.
[18:26.46]No, it's not.
[18:26.92]It's real life!
[18:29.79]Listen, just give iPhone another, like, seven iterations.
[18:32.43]They'll have them out in the next two years, and they'll have camera quality like that.
[18:35.73]They're purposely holding back camera quality so they have another iPhone to release next year.
[18:41.75]So, okay, I can destroy the yellow poison tank and explode.
[18:44.05]What the fuck is the alligator doing?
[18:47.11]How do you be stealthy with an alligator?
[18:48.75]See what I'm talking about?
[18:49.73]Like, what?
[18:50.15]How is this a stealth game?
[18:52.35]...fucking place to the ground.
[19:00.00]No, whoa, what would I just I shot who my shot somebody wasn't supposed to I think you just shot a civilian what?
[19:07.93]What is going on destroy the tanks they got like poison guns Wow we have to sabotage it is so loud the door
[19:28.67]Can you imagine listening to this when your compound's getting, like, raided by two special agents?
[19:33.41]Like, how do I get through the door?
[19:36.09]What's happening?
[19:36.65]Who's this guy?
[19:37.43]Oh, I got an enemy.
[19:40.05]Oops.
[19:40.73]Oh, shit.
[19:42.04]Alright, sure.
[19:42.38]Airdrop.
[19:42.60]Where do you want it?
[19:43.76]Where should I put it?
[19:44.42]Hey, there's a guy shooting at us over here.
[19:46.30]Why is it on fire?
[19:58.47]Why can I not move?
[19:59.55]I can't fucking move.
[20:01.00]I can't move the cursor.
[20:03.04]Is that gonna lead right on top of us?
[20:05.34]Oh, fuck.
[20:08.16]No shit, I can right click?
[20:11.48]Where is this?
[20:17.80]What am I looking at?
[20:18.80]How do I get- I can't get off of this.
[20:20.18]Okay.
[20:20.38]Wait.
[20:31.84]Did you just say a Spanish swear?
[20:33.74]I don't know why some of the gun sounds are so much louder than other ones.
[20:36.02]Eel.
[20:36.81]It's because one of them has a silencer on it.
[20:40.43]Okay.
[20:43.31]We only did 17%?
[20:45.19]Oh, we gotta get this car.
[20:49.96]Where's the music coming from?
[20:51.76]How do I drive this?
[20:55.98]W?
[20:57.02]Why can't I go to the front seat?
[21:03.36]Oh, are you kidding me?
[21:04.08]Yeah.
[21:04.46]I'm taking this thing.
[21:06.36]Oh.
[21:11.52]Okay, just sabotage the plantation.
[21:14.92]Here we go.
[21:15.28]Yeah, we've only destroyed 20%.
[21:16.17]I think we have to, like, hang on.
[21:18.55]Wait a second.
[21:19.27]Are they doing the, like, set the drug farm on fire quest at the beginning of the game as the first quest?
[21:24.89]Sorry, that scared the shit out of me.
[21:26.11]I don't know why.
[21:30.32]What was that?
[21:34.80]Oh shit, there's a guy.
[21:39.46]That guy just exploded into blood.
[21:43.06]Oh no, it wasn't.
[21:43.76]I thought he just like turned into blood mist.
[21:45.88]It's this guy.
[21:48.28]I'm like following you for some reason.
[21:49.60]I thought that guy just disintegrated.
[21:50.60]You're not moving.
[21:53.48]Oh my god.
[21:54.04]Alright, get me out of here.
[21:58.54]Oh shit, this is bad.
[21:59.58]Alright, alligator's okay.
[22:04.15]Oh my god!
[22:06.39]What the fuck?!
[22:09.69]He won't let me in.
[22:12.39]Okay, burn the red tobacco plants with my toadster.
[22:20.20]USB stick.
[22:20.76]Alright, we gotta burn these plants.
[22:35.05]What?
[22:35.61]Oh shit, it burns!
[22:37.41]Get rid of it!
[22:44.07]Do you think Spanish songs are still DMCA-able?
[22:47.25]I think everything is.
[22:51.44]Wait, collect gasoline?
[22:52.78]What do I do with this?
[22:56.98]Watch out, get out of there.
[23:06.51]How are you supposed to safely do this without getting burned?
[23:08.85]I'm just thinking, you know, if the DMCA people can't understand the lyrics, then maybe... It's an algorithm, man.
[23:15.66]It's an algorithm.
[23:22.28]Where are you right now, and why are you not helping me burn all this?
[23:24.98]I'm over here burning other farms.
[23:27.30]That's what I'm doing.
[23:28.24]This is co-op.
[23:29.26]It's cooperative.
[23:30.79]I don't burn the same farm you're burning.
[23:32.45]That's redundant.
[23:33.19]No.
[23:35.54]Go back to front.
[23:36.52]Alright, we're at 50%.
[23:46.66]This was not a stealth mission anyway.
[23:48.64]No, this is like you destroy everything.
[23:53.34]3D movie jump scare.
[24:03.57]Okay.
[24:04.61]Alright.
[24:05.05]I don't have any more gasoline.
[24:07.73]It picks them up from a barrel.
[24:09.57]I have been.
[24:11.23]You haven't made one weed joke?
[24:15.29]No.
[24:15.65]I mean, that's so easy.
[24:19.70]There are no weed jokes left.
[24:20.78]I mean, can I, like... I can't just, like, cut this down?
[24:27.90]Can I change my weapon?
[24:32.52]Does that work?
[24:36.29]He's just on fire running through all this.
[24:42.67]Now I'm on fire.
[24:43.55]There's still some over here.
[24:45.19]Do you have any gas left?
[24:47.27]Where are you?
[24:49.82]I'm trying to shoot the plants to get rid of them.
[24:52.54]Really?
[24:53.46]You can destroy the yellow barrels.
[24:58.22]Wait, that's where the music's coming from.
[24:59.56]Okay, you just get the shit out of me.
[25:04.39]I've got a blue friendly icon over my head.
[25:06.81]This is where the music comes from, hold on.
[25:07.83]And I'm wearing a mask, so you couldn't tell it was me.
[25:10.65]This is where- I see the- look at the volume indicator.
[25:12.71]That's where the music comes from.
[25:14.41]What?
[25:17.70]What?
[25:17.96]Okay, I, uh... I don't know what just happened.
[25:19.76]Something exploded.
[25:21.14]Yeah, that was, uh... Oh, that's a good guy.
[25:25.54]Wait, who?
[25:26.90]Okay.
[25:27.82]Oh, shit.
[25:29.66]What?
[25:30.58]Wait, I have grenade!
[25:34.01]Okay, what?
[25:34.61]Oh, that was my, like, three in Overwatch.
[25:37.10]I don't even know what the fuck I just did.
[25:45.86]First of all, Overwatch joke in 2021.
[25:48.54]Second of all... I'd say only Watchers and Smite.
[25:50.57]I'd say only two moments.
[25:52.91]Oh, we did it.
[25:53.27]We did it.
[25:53.51]We can go back.
[25:56.63]On my way.
[25:58.51]Yeah, I think we're good.
[26:00.97]We can keep going.
[26:05.61]We'll both head back to the large stone tower.
[26:07.63]Alright, we did it.
[26:09.37]Make sure you get your, uh, your... Where is this music coming from?
[26:12.16]I think it's just thematic.
[26:18.46]It's just there to, like, get you all jazzed up, dude.
[26:22.70]Well, I don't... There's no context of where we'll be coming from, though.
[26:28.42]I don't know.
[26:28.70]We're apparently sticking it to the government by destroying the drugs, which seems counterintuitive.
[26:35.75]Alright, song's over.
[26:37.64]But I think they're laced with poison.
[26:39.82]Fake raid?
[26:41.24]Somebody said fake.
[26:42.04]I don't see a raid, but fake raid?
[26:45.86]Then he just tried to raid you, but accidentally raided a fake Jerma.
[26:50.20]What?
[26:53.52]Hold on.
[26:54.58]Is that... What happened?
[26:57.26]Well, hi everybody.
[26:59.16]I guess not here?
[27:00.00]Where'd he...
[27:06.42]He forgot the 985.
[27:08.22]Oh, shit.
[27:09.26]Well, thanks anyways.
[27:10.44]Appreciate it.
[27:12.10]Is this not the large stone tower?
[27:13.79]This looks like it.
[27:18.37]He's over there, though.
[27:19.89]Wait, he's coming this way.
[27:22.05]He's pathing.
[27:23.39]Come on.
[27:25.33]Oops.
[27:25.99]You're okay.
[27:27.23]Yeah, he was just walking through, like, the brush.
[27:29.13]Oops.
[27:34.71]Yeah, but thanks Vinny if you're watching.
[27:36.31]That's actually fucking hilarious.
[27:40.01]Fake Jerva got a raid.
[27:44.04]But hey guys, welcome.
[27:45.80]Playing Far Cry 6 with Etalyx.
[27:49.32]Is he good?
[27:50.06]I think he's good.
[27:51.72]Did you do your super move?
[27:54.40]Don't do that.
[27:54.84]Stop.
[27:54.96]What are you throwing at him?
[27:56.25]What is those?
[28:05.08]How do you do that?
[28:05.94]How do I do that?
[28:08.58]Stop!
[28:09.94]You're telling me to stop.
[28:11.12]You're interrupting the NPC cutscene.
[28:14.34]How do I do it?
[28:15.87]Oh, yeah.
[28:16.85]Okay.
[28:17.41]It's middle mouse.
[28:19.21]I thought you said it was middle mouse.
[28:23.95]It is.
[28:25.39]You have to hit Q and then mouse over the holster and then mouse wheel.
[28:32.53]Hey, what?
[28:38.61]Is that the horse?
[28:43.83]Do you see something that I don't?
[28:45.71]Somebody's screaming, dude.
[28:47.31]Do you not hear the screams?
[28:48.58]No.
[28:49.50]Oh my god.
[28:53.42]I don't know who it is.
[28:54.22]Is it him?
[28:57.04]Did you kill him?
[29:02.12]I'm trying to cut the screams off.
[29:06.92]Now he's screaming in my game, though.
[29:08.60]Alright, if we bring him back, will the screaming stop?
[29:17.17]Okay.
[29:18.27]Holy shit, dude.
[29:19.43]That was insane.
[29:20.97]Somebody was screaming in my ear.
[29:22.15]I swear to God.
[29:25.37]Oh, head back to the tower.
[29:26.87]Alright, you want to grab a horse?
[29:32.87]Yeah, we got two horses here.
[29:34.68]Are you good?
[29:35.16]Is it streaming?
[29:36.56]Yeah, apparently it's fine.
[29:38.08]I still got to talk to him.
[29:39.92]Hold on.
[29:40.72]I can't believe you weren't hearing that.
[29:41.86]It was like a loud human scream in my ear.
[29:44.24]Okay, now we're good.
[29:45.30]That was a quick turn.
[29:46.76]Alright.
[29:47.76]Oh, nice.
[29:49.02]Now we both have horses.
[29:50.10]Awesome.
[30:09.19]Do you want to lead the way or should I?
[30:11.79]Do we have another mission?
[30:14.49]Where do you want to go?
[30:17.13]We should find a car.
[30:18.11]I mean, this car is back in the drug lab.
[30:22.11]Can you do that?
[30:25.65]What?
[30:26.11]Hold on.
[30:27.39]Apparently not.
[30:31.51]Oh, yeah.
[30:32.03]There you go.
[30:32.88]Nice.
[30:35.39]Sorry, my horse wasn't professionally trained.
[30:37.77]Oh, we're on the phone.
[30:38.77]Alright, stop hurting my horse.
[30:40.46]Oh, new quest.
[30:57.68]Which means votes for Libertad.
[30:59.34]He lives on the east side of Kassa's Cove.
[31:02.30]Hope nobody's in here!
[31:03.82]Aw, come on, really?
[31:05.58]That would've been really funny.
[31:06.42]We need Benito.
[31:08.06]Talk to him.
[31:10.50]So I've been following the story so far, and basically here's how it works.
[31:14.08]Literally any person who has speaking lines gets shot in the head at some point.
[31:18.44]It happens about five times in the prologue.
[31:20.34]Really?
[31:21.24]Yeah.
[31:22.54]So, um, basically just... violence is the answer, I think.
[31:27.48]I mean, I will say the game is, it's very pretty.
[31:30.70]It's like, really, the graphics are really decent.
[31:33.02]We've only been playing for 20 minutes.
[31:34.12]You're already making justifications for your future 6 out of 10.
[31:36.68]Okay.
[31:38.24]Um, I'm, do we really, every one of these is a 6 out of 10.
[31:42.04]Locked in.
[31:42.52]It's grayed out.
[31:44.26]You can't even scroll your mouse over it.
[31:46.28]It's grayed out.
[31:48.60]It's locked in 6 out of 10.
[31:54.31]Dude!
[31:58.86]Why would you swerve to my right?
[32:06.04]Oh fuck!
[32:13.10]Oh no, is he alright?
[32:13.92]Oh shit!
[32:14.66]He just ran him over.
[32:15.47]Is he okay?
[32:16.65]He's fine.
[32:18.57]He's alright.
[32:20.17]He's alright.
[32:22.73]He's still moving around.
[32:24.34]Get out of here.
[32:25.14]What the fuck?
[32:26.20]No, I didn't want that to happen.
[32:27.33]Hey, don't.
[32:30.45]Give me that.
[32:30.93]I can't.
[32:38.43]What's that?
[32:40.82]Oh, shit.
[32:46.98]I can't get off of him.
[32:54.70]What the hell was that?
[32:59.98]I don't know, man.
[33:03.14]I don't know why I'm riding this guy's ass.
[33:08.91]You're going too far away from your partner?
[33:10.45]Oh, shit.
[33:11.03]I'm gonna lose you.
[33:11.59]Yeah, you ran over my horse.
[33:12.67]I'm, like, running towards you.
[33:17.87]Wait.
[33:19.13]Where are you?
[33:20.19]I'm about to hijack a car.
[33:21.76]Okay, good, good.
[33:22.28]You're gonna have to come to me.
[33:26.93]Okay.
[33:27.89]Is that you?
[33:30.03]Wait.
[33:30.94]Are you on my... I'm so confused right now.
[33:34.78]I have no idea what's going on.
[33:37.32]That's you.
[33:38.50]It's me, yeah.
[33:39.70]Can we get the truck?
[33:41.56]Yeah.
[33:42.58]He just knocked a tree down on top of him, but he's fine.
[33:45.13]Okay, let's go.
[33:46.61]Where are we going?
[33:49.99]You're the pilot.
[33:51.19]Okay, I'm the pilot.
[34:04.19]Oh, you threw that.
[34:04.77]Did that guy say, I know I heard something?
[34:12.99]Yeah, there's a... The bad guys are in red.
[34:15.45]That's how you know they're bad.
[34:17.16]And the good guys are in blue.
[34:18.18]That's how you know they're good.
[34:19.50]The ex-guerrilla at his shipyard.
[34:20.86]Can you, um... Can you give, like, a waypoint for us?
[34:24.32]Oh, it's over here.
[34:25.58]What the fuck was that?
[34:27.28]There's dogs.
[34:28.20]They just spawned out of nowhere.
[34:30.74]They live here.
[34:33.77]Why are you chasing them?
[34:34.69]I'm going to the marker.
[34:36.39]See?
[34:37.01]This is the star thing.
[34:43.87]My character is bored with you driving, so he's just humming to himself.
[34:46.77]You are humming.
[34:50.50]Are we the questers?
[34:52.70]I think these are questers.
[34:58.18]Is this a fishing?
[34:59.86]Might be.
[35:06.68]There was a joke attempt.
[35:08.33]But you need a little bit more distance.
[35:11.57]The best part is he's looking over there.
[35:14.69]Because the explosions happened over there.
[35:19.65]It's just the sound is what made us afraid.
[35:22.92]Not the visual.
[35:23.86]Ooh, a car.
[35:25.18]Okay, I need to secure.
[35:27.52]I actually probably have a good idea.
[35:37.69]I don't... Can we even craft anything?
[35:39.63]I think so.
[35:40.03]Okay, I'm going to do... I'm going to do standard rounds in this.
[35:46.48]Wait, no.
[35:46.88]Soft target.
[35:50.30]The standard rounds are fine, right?
[35:53.78]I mean, sure.
[35:56.92]Charms?
[35:57.64]Oh, these are cosmetic.
[36:02.72]Oh, I have skins.
[36:06.41]Dude, did you get the ultimate edition with, like, cyberpunk skins?
[36:11.11]Absolutely not.
[36:12.61]I did.
[36:14.12]All your ride using Q. Okay.
[36:15.80]Your ride will be delivered to you.
[36:17.22]Okay.
[36:21.12]Are we actually going to get DMCA for these?
[36:24.82]I don't know.
[36:26.00]Where's baby?
[36:32.66]Um, hold on a minute.
[36:33.36]Are we, are we Ghostbusters?
[36:34.60]You can throw fucking baseballs at people.
[36:35.78]This game just went, it went a full letter grade up.
[36:37.83]That's what I was doing earlier.
[36:38.83]I was doing that 30 minutes ago when you asked me what I was doing.
[36:41.41]Oh my god, oh my god, this got a full letter grade.
[36:42.79]I thought you were throwing, I thought you were throwing knives at somebody.
[36:45.89]I mean, I can do that too.
[36:47.91]Oh.
[36:48.41]Alright, no stops.
[36:48.99]So now we have to call our ride?
[36:58.38]I don't have that option.
[37:00.48]You hold Q?
[37:08.94]That was a bad guy.
[37:10.14]That was a bad guy?
[37:12.07]Yeah, that was a bad guy.
[37:14.65]Oh.
[37:15.95]Wait, you can carry bodies?
[37:23.33]Do you have to call a ride?
[37:24.57]See if you have access to a ride.
[37:33.66]You're a psycho.
[37:34.98]I need a ride.
[37:36.50]Ride's on the way.
[37:40.92]Alright.
[37:44.50]No, don't!
[37:47.76]We just got this.
[37:50.08]It's so hard to judge the range.
[37:52.26]Alright, you drive.
[37:55.62]I'll be the guy that goes, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung.
[38:01.31]Let's see.
[38:02.55]Oh, no, I was wrong.
[38:03.39]Okay.
[38:09.30]Where are we going?
[38:11.72]I don't know.
[38:12.16]We're going the right way.
[38:16.18]Look, anti-aircraft cannons.
[38:17.78]Okay.
[38:18.68]Secure gasoline.
[38:20.78]This car drives to the right for no reason.
[38:23.66]You got all of them.
[38:29.42]Those are bad guys, right?
[38:30.40]I don't think two of them were.
[38:32.26]I think they were just civilians.
[38:33.08]Is he going to desynchronize me like Assassin's Creed?
[38:39.93]They were wearing red.
[38:40.71]You can't wear red out here.
[38:44.63]My game's lagging.
[38:45.37]Oh, there we go.
[38:47.61]Which way are you going?
[38:49.05]I'm trying to drive in a straight line, but unironically, it's pulling to the right.
[38:55.25]Why is it making me aim over there?
[38:57.95]What?
[38:58.23]I think auto-aim just took that over.
[39:08.67]Alright, let's go.
[39:09.67]Are you still- Okay, you still in the car?
[39:11.83]I mean, I was.
[39:20.98]Are you?
[39:21.34]I'm trying to assess the situation here.
[39:24.58]Get- Why does this look like the Ghostbusters car?
[39:28.52]That's why.
[39:29.78]I know.
[39:31.87]What the fuck?
[39:36.53]Heeeeeeey!
[39:39.76]Are you hooked on to that car?
[39:42.05]Yes.
[39:42.29]Where are we going?
[39:57.13]Oh no, here comes the Ghostbuster.
[40:01.11]I'm like kind of scared of what's coming down the road here.
[40:10.68]How do you turn the radio off?
[40:13.28]Left slash.
[40:15.42]Why?
[40:21.78]We're all just waiting to see what you do.
[40:24.38]Me?
[40:24.94]Yeah.
[40:26.28]What?
[40:27.42]You're in the little car, right?
[40:29.10]I mean, I'm attached to the little car.
[40:32.24]I'm not going to ram into you at full speed because that's too easy.
[40:35.29]No, it was.
[40:35.77]That would be a -2.
[40:37.15]No, that would be a +2.
[40:38.89]That'd be a -2.
[40:42.35]I am a person of refined tastes and I was just waiting on a better option to arrive But that that's a better option watch out for the alligator Well there it can chat loves easy joke somebody just said yeah I'm the one that died not the people other people there me subverted expectations, bitch
[41:10.85]How did... I'm the one that... Okay, well, whatever.
[41:12.53]Alright, let's get back in the, uh... Let's get back in the ecto-cooler.
[41:24.61]Oh, switch seat.
[41:25.21]Okay.
[41:27.83]So, assassinate Commandant Rosario.
[41:31.86]Okay, she's inspecting a military site.
[41:33.84]We have a lot of random shit to do.
[41:35.24]Alright, let's do it.
[41:36.20]We're gonna go to the closest one.
[41:37.66]Which is right here.
[41:46.82]Did he drown?
[41:52.16]Alright, it's right here.
[41:57.12]What the fuck is going on?
[41:58.88]It's right here.
[42:01.72]Right there.
[42:01.96]238.
[42:02.18]I just swam.
[42:16.68]Okay, yeah, but you, like, actually teleported from underwater.
[42:24.30]Yeah, somebody said that took 10 seconds for you to do that, but it also, keep in mind, I saved us probably two or three minutes driving that way.
[42:35.45]Um... There's someone over on this other side here.
[42:46.04]Yeah, but how do you get up there?
[42:47.64]I was just trying to, and I started screaming.
[42:52.68]So this is going to save us time.
[42:53.82]It's your ass, it is.
[43:03.91]Yep.
[43:17.77]Why have you done this?
[43:24.19]You know what?
[43:32.15]Alright, I'll activate it.
[43:36.02]Will you just teleport to me?
[43:37.54]Can you teleport to me?
[43:39.08]Probably.
[43:39.60]Oh, he's right here.
[43:47.89]You can't ride wild horses.
[43:50.12]You can?
[43:51.68]No, I mean, there's tame and there's wild horses.
[43:57.76]Alright, me and my alligator are going to hang out.
[44:02.75]Turn on friendly fire.
[44:03.63]It's already on.
[44:11.03]Be careful.
[44:12.05]Don't go there.
[44:12.59]Don't fall.
[44:15.48]Oh, there you are.
[44:17.32]I'm over here.
[44:18.60]I'm ready for the mission.
[44:19.72]Okay.
[44:20.26]You ready?
[44:26.20]We're trespassing currently.
[44:28.78]I think pretty much everything we do in this stream is illegal.
[44:33.58]Boat.
[44:35.12]That boat's really far.
[44:37.16]And probably not drivable.
[44:39.16]Oh, is it just an asset?
[44:40.18]Is it just like a far away like JPP?
[44:42.86]Like whatever, you know, the image thing?
[44:47.21]There are tanks we can ride, too.
[44:50.77]Okay, so this is... What is this?
[44:53.72]Wait, I think we have to... Who is who?
[44:56.08]Is somebody talking to me?
[44:57.66]I think we're supposed to blow this tank up.
[45:03.12]What just happened?
[45:04.46]Blew the tank up.
[45:06.46]Oh, you fired at me.
[45:07.32]Okay.
[45:09.10]There was a tank.
[45:10.00]Hold on.
[45:10.26]How do I get you up?
[45:15.26]Repair?
[45:17.61]Wait, oh, we're supposed to drive it.
[45:23.02]Get her.
[45:23.36]Oh, she's getting in the tank.
[45:28.50]She's getting in the tank.
[45:29.32]I'm just making you aware she's in the tank now.
[45:31.78]She's driving the tank.
[45:33.80]She's just taking the forest.
[45:38.42]Listen, why does it say repair the tank if they're going to drive the tank?
[45:43.27]Why did you mortar me when I was standing next to her?
[45:45.57]Listen, it said to blow up the tank.
[45:50.27]It's fine.
[45:50.63]We're right here.
[45:51.13]It's fine.
[45:52.14]Let's go.
[45:53.76]Ow.
[45:53.92]Ow.
[45:54.08]Alright, I'm stealthed.
[46:11.19]I'm stealth.
[46:12.42]We're invisible.
[46:13.10]I'm inside of a flower patch.
[46:14.70]Oh fuck, that guy just looked at me.
[46:17.58]Not stealth anymore.
[46:18.62]Are you stealth?
[46:24.36]That guy's running to get in the tank, by the way.
[46:29.43]He definitely is.
[46:30.03]Look at him.
[46:31.11]He's like, oh my god, they're here!
[46:32.13]Oh my god, we're gonna get in the fucking tank!
[46:35.73]Okay, he's getting inside the tank.
[46:37.37]He's inside it.
[46:39.86]Somebody else is... Somebody else in this tank?
[46:42.50]That was me.
[46:43.68]I'm dead.
[46:45.04]What the fuck?
[46:46.29]Are you dead?
[46:47.33]Somebody just aimed the tank at my face.
[46:50.15]Oh, he was in it.
[46:50.93]I thought he was gonna fire at me.
[46:53.05]I thought that's the tank you were talking about.
[46:55.35]You were like hiding behind that tank.
[46:57.89]It was like, dude, look, somebody's running into the tank right now.
[47:01.24]They're getting in.
[47:01.86]Oh my god, they saw me and they're running into the tank.
[47:03.90]And I thought you were like setting up for a joke.
[47:05.70]I mean, when he turned really slowly to look at me, I kind of wanted him to shoot me point blank range, I'll be honest.
[47:10.52]I'll be honest.
[47:12.02]What did my voice just do right there?
[47:13.14]That was weird.
[47:14.94]Dropping it.
[47:16.44]Alright, let's just get in here.
[47:23.70]Your parachute is still on.
[47:33.08]Get your parachute off, bro.
[47:35.14]That's why they can see us.
[47:41.99]That is so stupid.
[47:46.03]Get in there and fight him.
[47:48.05]Come on in there.
[47:51.67]You're the birthday boy right now.
[47:55.75]Just to make sure everybody knows who the birthday boy is.
[47:58.01]Oh, my God.
[47:58.53]The tank.
[48:00.65]Put the phone down, you idiot.
[48:09.63]What do you mean, help?
[48:16.10]Alright, let's actually... I'm trying!
[48:19.30]I'm on fire!
[48:21.20]The dude, when they get in the tank, they just... God, the parachute just fucking... The parachute just fucked the whole thing up, okay?
[48:27.97]It was a major distraction.
[48:29.23]I killed, like, eight people.
[48:31.35]Okay.
[48:32.03]We have to, like, go in there and just, like, sabotage the tanks with mortars and shit.
[48:35.51]We're gonna... Okay.
[48:36.03]Okay.
[48:42.42]Alright, look.
[48:44.28]First of all, let's just make sure what mission even is this.
[48:47.56]Go to the depot and free up the fuel so we can survive and kill the commandant so they think twice about trying again.
[48:53.76]Okay, this is a major mission we're about to do.
[48:56.08]This is rank four.
[48:57.52]Look, I bet I could do this in stealth by myself.
[49:01.15]You think so?
[49:02.21]Yeah.
[49:02.53]Okay, let's find out.
[49:03.79]I'll be watching.
[49:04.25]Okay, hang on.
[49:05.63]I'm going to leave Guapo here.
[49:06.53]That must be Rosario.
[49:19.79]Can I mark them for you?
[49:21.47]Yeah.
[49:21.69]Is that actually working?
[49:33.30]I got this.
[49:36.10]Birthday boy assassination mission.
[49:40.69]Nice.
[49:41.61]Very, very nice.
[49:42.43]Very nice.
[49:43.37]I think one person's running to me.
[49:46.04]Um, you've got one person in front of you.
[49:47.66]The person on the mountain directly under you.
[49:51.94]Yep.
[49:52.14]Oh, they're coming in.
[49:55.69]I don't think they know of your presence yet.
[49:56.83]Oh, somebody actually underneath me, too.
[49:58.23]There's two people.
[50:01.29]Guy, you're going to be right in front of you.
[50:02.55]Careful.
[50:03.33]He's going down towards the outside area.
[50:09.45]You see him?
[50:09.83]Okay.
[50:10.53]Are they facing me or away from me?
[50:12.15]He is facing you and you are, he's like above that lip.
[50:15.63]If you go, if you jump up, he's going to be right there looking at you.
[50:18.46]They're actually all coming up there right now.
[50:20.08]They're like climbing up there.
[50:20.98]Yes.
[50:21.68]That guy's climbing the ladder in front of you.
[50:23.14]What?
[50:23.74]That guy's climbing up there.
[50:24.98]There's a guy up here.
[50:27.98]You're chasing him right now.
[50:30.48]This guy knows you're chasing him.
[50:31.55]He's running away from you.
[50:37.23]Okay, now they're going up that ladder.
[50:39.22]Why are they all up there?
[50:41.20]I don't know.
[50:41.64]I think they heard you.
[50:42.64]They didn't see me.
[50:43.56]I haven't been spotted yet.
[50:44.54]They're coming down.
[50:46.60]They're sliding back down.
[50:51.05]They're both down.
[50:56.11]Uh-oh.
[51:01.33]Oh, you got two different people here.
[51:02.90]There's like four people here.
[51:04.14]There's the commander.
[51:05.50]Yeah, the commander's here, and there's three people on the other side.
[51:09.52]Listen, I need some Ubisoft call-outs.
[51:12.28]Uh, sure.
[51:17.92]Bro, watch out.
[51:19.38]On your three.
[51:20.36]Three o'clock.
[51:23.00]No, nice, nice.
[51:24.30]Three o'clock.
[51:25.66]Awesome, dude.
[51:26.32]Good job.
[51:28.70]Straight ahead.
[51:34.28]watch out watch out he's this guy's angry this guy's angry up on your left side you can see him right there right in front of him come on give him the booyah there it is nice job nice job they're suspicious I don't know if you can really get these two they see the body
[52:06.53]The one on the far side is the one... You know, it's really hard to not just get out of this binoculars and press V. Can I tell you how hard it is for me to not do that right now?
[52:14.59]Uh-oh.
[52:15.23]This guy sees.
[52:17.03]Uh-oh.
[52:17.63]Now two people see.
[52:18.57]Oh, they all see.
[52:19.77]Now you're in trouble.
[52:21.05]That guy just threw his bottle.
[52:23.41]That guy just threw like a... Wait, what did he just do?
[52:24.83]He threw like a firework.
[52:26.57]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[52:30.91]That guy just shot a lair in the air.
[52:34.94]I just used my best stealth maneuver.
[52:37.00]Let me help you.
[52:42.20]I did it.
[52:43.48]Oh, fuck.
[52:44.26]Oh, wait.
[52:44.52]I killed him.
[52:46.33]Was that you?
[52:46.95]I just killed that guy.
[52:48.51]Is there a mortar?
[52:49.45]Yeah.
[52:50.45]Wait.
[52:50.81]Hang on.
[52:52.01]You shot.
[52:52.37]That was me.
[52:53.83]I shot from here.
[52:55.37]You did yours, and then I did mine, and we doubled them.
[52:59.18]There was not a guy.
[53:00.08]You just mortared me.
[53:02.87]That was the only guy left.
[53:06.05]Roger that.
[53:06.41]I got a sniper rifle?
[53:15.50]Okay, so that was cool.
[53:17.46]Let's get a tank.
[53:18.34]Can we actually drive this one?
[53:25.10]Enter as driver.
[53:26.04]Can we both get one?
[53:27.18]Did it not let us drive during the mission?
[53:31.33]Apparently not.
[53:31.91]I know what you're going to do.
[53:35.51]If I don't get in this tank fast.
[53:36.67]No, I'm not going to.
[53:38.25]I actually want to roll into the next mission with two tanks and scare the absolute shit out of the four guards we have to take down because this is mission number two of the game.
[53:50.15]Don't do it.
[53:50.55]No, we have to make it work.
[53:53.03]I literally just looked.
[53:54.17]I have to look where I'm going.
[53:55.63]The turret just happens to point where I'm looking.
[53:57.62]Okay.
[53:57.88]I'm not going to like sabotage.
[54:00.04]We just won the mission.
[54:02.58]I just won the mission.
[54:04.18]We are so far away from this one.
[54:09.06]Better get going.
[54:11.17]Which way?
[54:11.95]We have a mission.
[54:12.53]It's the other way.
[54:15.17]It's like behind you.
[54:16.39]It's far away from the possibly could be.
[54:23.73]Map seems kind of small.
[54:24.61]I wonder if it opens up later.
[54:29.33]This is one of the islands, I think.
[54:30.77]There might be more than one.
[54:31.81]Yeah.
[54:35.29]This thing actually fucking moves for a tank.
[54:37.49]Holy shit.
[54:39.45]Doesn't this feel like it's driving way too fast for a tank?
[54:42.87]Tanks, uh...
[54:46.25]Maybe the sense of speed has worked.
[54:48.11]We're just so used to walking everywhere that you can just tell these guys.
[54:56.50]1800.
[54:56.52]This is going to take so long.
[55:04.77]Are you shooting the machine?
[55:05.73]Oh, that's a machine gun.
[55:07.99]No, don't shoot that.
[55:13.48]Tanks are deceptively fast.
[55:15.00]I think the only reason why is because the only time you see a tank in like a movie or a TV show, it's just going like... Like two miles per hour for some reason.
[55:24.04]You never see tanks moving fast.
[55:34.31]I did not know there was a person there.
[55:36.53]Wait, you moved the thing.
[55:38.29]You hit him with the stick.
[55:42.80]If you turn, if you turn and aim, you're gonna hit Slade in the head.
[55:46.58]No, she ducked!
[55:49.86]She actually ducked underneath it.
[55:53.71]No, don't!
[56:00.97]I think you hit her with a stick.
[56:02.17]Okay.
[56:13.48]Stop.
[56:14.12]Don't run into the road.
[56:15.21]Get out of here.
[56:17.01]Get out of here.
[56:18.55]Get out.
[56:19.39]Get out.
[56:19.99]Move.
[56:25.03]This is like when you spawn in the tank in GTA.
[56:28.74]Like, how are we supposed to be beat now?
[56:33.54]I wouldn't surprise if you, like, turned around.
[56:34.92]There was, like, just four, like, green, like, player number, like, uh, usernames.
[56:39.36]Attracted to shrink.
[56:40.37]It's a billion over.
[56:51.02]What was that?
[56:51.94]He's hard to drive.
[56:52.72]Every time.
[57:00.68]That guy just backed off into a ravine.
[57:03.91]You killed that guy.
[57:06.11]That was you that did that.
[57:08.07]Everything is so loud.
[57:13.00]Who did I kill?
[57:14.24]No, you're killing them.
[57:16.14]Why am I getting... Dude, you're doing dishonorable kills while we're in the same party.
[57:20.36]I'm getting negative points because of that.
[57:21.73]This is so loud.
[57:23.33]I can't hear anything besides tank sounds.
[57:44.05]Did they just try to spike strip us?
[57:45.37]Didn't work.
[57:53.02]I'm trying to do the thing that I used to do in TF2 where I would just load into like bad water and come out of the spawn and just aim the Huntsman and just shoot it into the air and hope to God that I hit somebody in the head.
[58:04.93]I think every single person.
[58:05.91]You're trying to do the COD like throwing knife beginning of match.
[58:10.09]Yeah, and the thing is, it sucks because in like 10 plus years that I played TF2, the hundreds of hours I probably played Huntsman Sniper, it never happened.
[58:19.46]That's just disappointing.
[58:20.20]You think that maybe once in like 5,000, 10,000 chances it would work.
[58:22.24]I mean, that's why it took so long to record the videos.
[58:26.72]You were just sitting there doing that the entire time.
[58:32.87]Alright, so what are we doing here?
[58:35.61]Secure gasoline.
[58:36.81]Alright, we got to secure the gasoline.
[58:46.57]Really?
[58:46.81]This is going to stop a tank?
[58:47.86]A fucking parking garage?
[58:51.18]A little strip?
[58:53.30]Oh, it's a spike.
[58:53.80]Yeah, spike strips.
[58:59.38]I told you.
[59:00.44]We're way over prepared for the second mission of the game.
[59:03.32]Oh, I think I just blew the gas station.
[59:05.86]I think I just blew the gas station.
[59:08.70]I'm just letting you go first.
[59:10.59]Alright, don't blow up those tanks.
[59:15.71]Secure fuel.
[59:16.45]Alright, we need to secure this fuel.
[59:17.41]I'm gonna get out.
[59:19.18]Cover me.
[59:20.80]That wasn't me.
[59:23.74]I haven't done a thing.
[59:25.92]You just got killed on by the actual regular guys.
[59:28.80]After getting up on a soapbox and saying how overprepared we were.
[59:33.60]Hold on, I'm gonna come save you.
[59:35.88]I would be careful.
[59:36.90]I'm probably gonna spawn in your car.
[59:41.99]I don't think he can even get me.
[59:42.95]Nice.
[59:44.41]Alright.
[59:44.75]So, secure the gas.
[59:46.11]Why is it going slow motion?
[59:54.74]I just killed that guy.
[60:10.25]Oh, it was the last.
[60:11.27]It was the last guy.
[60:14.36]Nice.
[60:14.54]We got it.
[60:14.82]Good job.
[60:20.42]Excuse me?
[60:21.84]No, excuse me.
[60:22.86]No alarms sounded?
[60:23.96]I like how the radio every single time is like, okay, so what you're going to want to do is get up on a high place, use your camera, spot as many enemies as you can, and try to stay in stealth.
[60:35.29]I was coming with two tanks.
[60:39.05]Yeah, it said we didn't sound an alarm.
[60:41.11]We were the alarm.
[60:42.69]Okay, Benito.
[60:44.04]Rosario is dead.
[60:45.86]And the fuel is flowing again.
[60:49.84]Okay, overcome the regime to become stronger.
[60:51.48]Are we just going to stay in the tanks for the whole game?
[60:54.56]No, that's kind of boring.
[60:55.54]I want to fly around like a helicopter or something.
[61:03.69]I'm ready for my new toy.
[61:06.33]We are so spoiled.
[61:09.25]Look at how spoiled we really are.
[61:14.03]The tank was fun to drive around a tank and shoot stuff.
[61:16.31]I want something else.
[61:17.19]Done with this thing.
[61:18.15]I'm done with it.
[61:23.34]I want a helicopter that can go on the water.
[61:26.66]That shoots missiles out the front.
[61:29.64]And I want to be able to fly- fast travel with it and I want to fly and I wanted to go underground too.
[61:33.70]How come there's no subterranean shit in Far Cry?
[61:35.82]I'm bored.
[61:37.08]I'm bored!
[61:46.37]I see what you're doing.
[61:48.13]I saw that.
[61:50.95]That guy is now- yeah, you fired- you fired guns at this dude on the motorcycle.
[61:57.15]And now he's going very fast to get away from you.
[62:04.16]I'm kind of wedged.
[62:05.48]Oh, nice.
[62:06.04]Thank you.
[62:20.10]Why would you drive directly into this?
[62:21.70]Don't you think you could hit the brakes?
[62:23.32]Oh my god.
[62:27.14]Did you do that?
[62:28.56]You did.
[62:29.14]Yes, you did.
[62:30.94]Okay.
[62:32.30]The alligators are cool and shit, but what the heck?
[62:35.57]What are they doing here?
[62:37.09]Why are they here?
[62:37.79]There's no reason for them to be out here right now.
[62:39.75]I don't know.
[62:40.39]Everybody, let's stay home.
[62:42.17]Do they run?
[62:43.75]They don't get in the car.
[62:45.31]They just run behind us.
[62:47.62]That seems just so strange.
[62:49.42]That shouldn't happen.
[62:52.77]What the hell's going on here?
[62:57.79]Who is that?
[62:58.31]It's like a random event.
[63:02.76]Okay, I think we need to save this guy.
[63:05.46]We're here to save you.
[63:09.98]I don't- I know what you- Get that- I'll get that away.
[63:14.34]I see what you are doing.
[63:15.40]I'm not doing anything.
[63:16.22]I'm just observing.
[63:16.78]Yes, you are.
[63:17.30]Yeah, observing with your gun.
[63:19.28]Okay.
[63:19.76]Look at the clouds.
[63:21.48]Oh, they're so beautiful.
[63:23.08]What's he doing?
[63:24.02]Oh, he's taking the gun.
[63:25.90]Alright, can we hang out?
[63:27.18]Can we hang out with this guy?
[63:28.40]I see you!
[63:29.62]What?
[63:30.56]Who the fuck?
[63:39.07]Bad guy.
[63:39.83]Is this a bad guy?
[63:40.57]That was a bad guy.
[63:42.01]I mean, he's a good guy.
[63:44.55]I see you!
[63:47.01]Can this guy get in the tank with us?
[63:51.11]Can you recruit people in Far Cry 5?
[63:53.35]It looks like he's kind of with us.
[63:54.64]Maybe he picked up a gun.
[63:56.56]Maybe he follows you.
[63:58.82]Here I go!
[64:03.98]Wait, that was you!
[64:06.88]I have... Okay, is it... He's almost dead.
[64:09.88]I know.
[64:10.12]He has one HP.
[64:11.18]But if you hit right-click, does it fire the machine gun until you hit right-click again?
[64:16.33]No, you just hold the button down.
[64:17.77]Listen, I... It's toggle.
[64:20.61]Because right-click is toggle for me.
[64:22.11]That includes this.
[64:23.69]Apparently, for some reason, this is aim down sights.
[64:27.45]It's the same thing, yeah.
[64:28.57]Yeah, but it's not.
[64:29.11]This is firing the weapon.
[64:30.09]It's not, but in the game it is.
[64:31.54]Alright, does he follow us?
[64:33.94]You killed him.
[64:34.34]I didn't.
[64:35.33]I didn't- He's alive!
[64:36.33]Why did you assume he's dead?
[64:37.41]I don't know, because I saw an explosion.
[64:44.43]Is that guy- Is that a bad guy?
[64:46.13]I don't know.
[64:47.09]They just rammed into me with a horse and I- I don't think that's a bad guy.
[64:52.92]I don't know what he's- Did he say sorry?
[65:01.28]Where's he going?
[65:04.14]I feel like we kind of need to see this guy's story.
[65:06.34]How it plays out.
[65:07.84]He's going to have a real short one.
[65:09.16]Alright, where is he?
[65:15.42]Where'd he go?
[65:17.38]Where'd he go?
[65:17.70]Did you just run him over?
[65:20.71]No, he's right here.
[65:25.35]That's not him.
[65:26.23]Who is this guy?
[65:26.93]That's not him.
[65:27.75]That's a different guy.
[65:28.57]Ow!
[65:32.42]That's a different guy.
[65:33.40]Where did my friend go?
[65:36.92]I don't know.
[65:37.38]No, he's right here.
[65:38.98]Alright, let's walk.
[65:39.72]I want to see where this guy goes.
[65:41.10]We have to see how this plays out.
[65:49.13]What's he doing?
[65:49.93]I don't know.
[65:50.43]Maybe he's not going to do anything.
[65:54.39]Why is he down here?
[65:55.45]I don't know.
[66:02.35]Guapo's in the way.
[66:03.35]Yeah, I'm trying to move him.
[66:05.91]Wait, he found a place to go.
[66:16.04]No, I think we've lost.
[66:18.64]This guy's not going to do anything.
[66:19.98]We expect way too much from this guy.
[66:21.86]I mean, we kind of do.
[66:25.06]I don't think we can tell him to come with us.
[66:27.89]I almost killed him.
[66:28.71]I saw the knife, yeah.
[66:30.47]That was scary.
[66:34.04]I don't know.
[66:38.28]Maybe if we just give him some space, he'll wander back to the road.
[66:41.80]No, I... Wait, he sees something.
[66:49.85]He does, yeah.
[66:50.67]Something sees us.
[66:53.39]Move your guapo.
[66:54.05]Alright, he's going up.
[67:06.84]I don't see anything so far.
[67:07.64]Oh, there's a guy over there.
[67:20.41]Wait.
[67:21.23]I hear something.
[67:21.65]Is that you?
[67:23.35]Alright, it's you.
[67:28.20]Okay.
[67:28.34]Alright, good.
[67:36.52]I'm just making sure the road was clear.
[67:45.09]I can't kill him.
[67:52.99]Yeah, you can't kill anybody with baseballs.
[67:57.70]Excuse me.
[67:58.04]Alright, he'll be fine.
[68:01.38]Let's go.
[68:04.28]I'm trying so hard not to snipe him with the tank.
[68:08.11]Oh, do it.
[68:09.31]He might show up later.
[68:11.29]You ever play Resident Evil 4?
[68:12.15]It's like a telltale moment.
[68:14.57]Maybe when you rescue the dog in the first 10 minutes of the game.
[68:19.19]And then, spoilers for Resident Evil 4 or whatever.
[68:20.94]Who cares?
[68:21.26]The game's like 15 years old.
[68:22.46]Why did you... Because I want to get in.
[68:24.78]Oh.
[68:28.90]I don't think I can.
[68:30.18]I can repair it.
[68:31.38]There's a gunner seat.
[68:32.78]Is there?
[68:33.92]I can't sit on it.
[68:35.40]Oh, there we go.
[68:35.78]Yeah.
[68:35.88]Alright.
[68:36.10]Let's go.
[68:36.44]Let's go.
[68:36.88]Let's go.
[68:53.31]You going to leave this behind?
[68:54.19]What?
[69:02.69]Oh!
[69:04.15]I wanted to be in the same tank and be friends.
[69:06.19]Oh yeah, that's fine.
[69:07.39]I'm trying to figure out what you're doing.
[69:08.73]What are you doing?
[69:11.75]I'm trying to get in the tank.
[69:12.66]Alright, what's the next mission?
[69:14.68]We gotta go back to the camp.
[69:16.12]Is it marked?
[69:16.54]Uh, I think it's just down the road.
[69:20.46]Alright, let's go.
[69:26.98]You good?
[69:27.48]Yeah, I'm good.
[69:28.63]What?
[69:29.27]Okay, alright.
[69:30.21]You're just oddly quiet.
[69:32.49]That thing is very loud.
[69:33.33]It's okay.
[69:46.74]We can just- Listen.
[69:47.92]We're friends.
[69:48.30]We can just have a quiet road trip.
[69:49.88]What are you going to be for Halloween?
[69:52.14]The Dark Knight Joker.
[69:53.62]That's what I am every single fucking year.
[69:55.76]I go to Halloween every year as the Dark Knight Joker.
[70:01.15]And I, like, go up to people and I go, oh, you know how I got these scars?
[70:03.31]Like, I just won't drop it.
[70:06.91]I'm just going to be, like, a squid.
[70:12.82]Alright, that's cool.
[70:24.78]Hey, wait, we have something going on over here.
[70:31.79]Put your gun away.
[70:34.77]I am in a tank.
[70:35.87]Put your gun away.
[70:38.01]That's true.
[70:39.09]That's true.
[70:39.41]Does this guy see me?
[70:47.80]I can't move.
[70:51.10]Why was he about to... It looked like he was about to be like, a ranger.
[70:55.04]Oh, yeah.
[70:55.57]I'll be eating you for dinner tomorrow.
[70:57.55]He's about to do like the nemesis system thing.
[70:59.37]He just like everything froze and it just looked at him.
[71:03.92]Oh shit, alright, we can get a gun?
[71:18.34]Christ is a bird.
[71:20.38]Oh, look at all these small, maybe crabs.
[71:25.61]Is it?
[71:25.99]Whoa.
[71:30.97]Alright, let's get a Jeep.
[71:32.29]Ah, boring.
[71:32.99]I want a boring new car.
[71:34.49]Can we get the person we just rescued in here?
[71:36.99]Yeah, it's only funny when you get... What's happening?
[72:02.59]Don't do anything stupid.
[72:05.35]That guy just blew his tires.
[72:07.73]Why'd he blow his tires?
[72:15.86]I don't want to hit her.
[72:16.88]I can't move.
[72:17.46]Can she get in?
[72:19.58]Hey!
[72:20.98]I see them!
[72:22.86]What?
[72:26.00]How do I honk the horn?
[72:26.63]Is it G?
[72:31.89]Can we get the crocs in the backseat?
[72:33.63]I don't know.
[72:33.97]I guess they don't... They can't jump in the back.
[72:35.69]That's kind of weird.
[72:41.25]Where are you going?
[72:45.67]Turning around.
[72:46.24]Okay.
[72:50.72]Oh my god.
[72:51.52]What is this?
[72:53.82]It's an anti-tank.
[72:54.90]It's an underwater fucking landmine.
[72:57.64]What the hell?
[72:58.10]Why?
[72:58.58]Oh my god.
[73:00.48]It's D-Day, in case somebody tries to invade this little beach inlet.
[73:05.85]There better not be another one right here.
[73:13.53]Alright.
[73:14.43]Heading up this way.
[73:15.21]We might have to get out and climb.
[73:19.21]Why would we?
[73:19.61]It's a... It's right here.
[73:22.80]I can't drive up there, I don't think.
[73:24.10]Okay.
[73:33.13]Because it's Clara's camp.
[73:35.25]Yeah, we're going back to the camp.
[73:37.92]Maybe they'll give us a new toy.
[73:40.26]I hope so.
[73:44.26]If they don't, I'm going to cry in the middle of the toy aisle.
[73:47.48]Oh, I thought that was an animal.
[73:50.98]Nope, just a bag.
[73:57.85]Are you zonked right now?
[73:59.21]No.
[74:01.49]Why should I be?
[74:12.96]Alright, here we go.
[74:14.31]Are we skipping the cutscene or are we going to watch?
[74:16.51]Because I don't know.
[74:18.49]I will try to skip it.
[74:21.01]How do you skip it?
[74:22.69]I don't think we can.
[74:37.14]Is this the black screen?
[74:37.92]Yeah, this is the black screen.
[74:40.66]The fire.
[74:42.26]Oh, there we go.
[74:43.98]You want us to take down cinematic with partner?
[74:46.46]Okay.
[74:47.36]Then leave us to die again.
[74:51.86]We are the worst.
[74:53.32]Like we really are.
[74:54.12]What's the point of like, what's the point of us playing this?
[74:56.92]I mean, we get to the gameplay.
[74:58.86]Okay.
[74:59.30]I just drive around cinematic trailers.
[75:01.51]Okay.
[75:01.83]Get to the gameplay.
[75:02.97]Am I right?
[75:03.37]Gamers.
[75:04.78]I mean, we're just, we're just driving, running people over with cars and throwing grenades and stuff.
[75:09.84]I guess that's fun, right?
[75:11.32]It's fun.
[75:12.52]Just kind of ride around and just drive around and ride around and drive around.
[75:17.19]Whatever I was saying.
[75:19.59]Alright, let's go.
[75:21.09]Now we have to get a mission.
[75:22.61]Oh shit, we probably shouldn't have skipped that.
[75:25.13]You get that chopper up and running.
[75:26.95]They got a helicopter.
[75:28.77]New toy!
[75:31.06]They heard you.
[75:32.16]The developers are listening.
[75:33.58]Okay, I'm going to put on like different clothes because I feel like I should be doing that, right?
[75:46.57]Do we have different clothes?
[75:47.65]I think so.
[75:48.17]Yeah, you have gear.
[75:48.99]We've gotten some stuff.
[75:52.98]We have like new weapons, don't we?
[75:54.06]I have a watch.
[75:56.42]I have a sniper rifle.
[75:57.58]I'm putting this thing on.
[76:06.89]Okay.
[76:08.49]How's the sniper?
[76:10.27]If I want air support, I have to blow it up.
[76:11.81]Alright.
[76:13.43]We need to, uh... There we go.
[76:19.93]What does it look like?
[76:23.83]Oh, shit.
[76:26.27]Okay.
[76:27.05]How do I zoom in?
[76:31.37]Is it really?
[76:33.09]What's the point of having a scope?
[76:36.25]Yeah, so you saw it too?
[76:39.27]It's basically just, uh... It's like when people play shooters that don't have crosshairs, and you just tape where the center of the screen is, like, on the middle of your monitor, so that you know where to hipfire.
[76:55.82]New photos, what are they?
[76:56.92]Okay, cool.
[76:59.23]So we have to destroy the, uh... SAM site?
[77:08.39]There are a bunch of horses here.
[77:09.27]You say we can't ride these?
[77:10.47]If they got a saddle on them, you can.
[77:14.03]That means they're not wild.
[77:15.50]That's how you tell the difference between a tame horse and a wild horse.
[77:19.94]I don't know if you knew this, but if you see horses in nature, they don't come prepped with leather saddles and other equipment.
[77:28.57]I don't have the ability to go on.
[77:31.86]Wait, can you climb it?
[77:32.88]Why can I not do that?
[77:33.52]Oh, there we go.
[77:35.92]Alright, so we're going to get that on the map.
[77:38.36]Where is it?
[77:38.68]Over there?
[77:40.72]We have to go destroy this shit.
[77:44.65]Okay, when did Far Cry become Just Cause?
[77:49.03]When they made six of them.
[77:51.83]Hey, we got to go over here and blow this up.
[77:53.63]Hold on, we got to go over there and blow that up.
[77:56.86]New mission?
[77:57.50]What are we blowing up?
[78:04.74]Is there a difference between... I mean, it's like... Not really.
[78:10.18]There's horses in this one.
[78:23.01]Do you think that the reason why they keep making Far Cry games, because all the Far Cry games are independent of each other, right?
[78:29.90]You think the reason is because they don't... If they came out with this game and it was called like... Into the Abyss or something, right?
[78:36.92]And it was not a Far Cry game.
[78:38.68]People would be like, this is just a Far Cry game.
[78:40.52]What the fuck are you doing?
[78:41.49]Like, what is this game?
[78:42.81]Them numbering these Far Cry games... I think gives them some leeway where it's just... Hey, it's just another Far Cry game.
[78:48.23]Don't worry.
[78:49.31]They don't have to explain why it's so similar.
[78:51.09]How do you fish?
[78:56.21]We got fishing rod as a reward.
[78:57.97]It's a known brand.
[78:59.49]Yeah.
[79:00.29]They can't make this another game.
[79:03.95]How do you fish?
[79:09.27]I don't know.
[79:09.79]We got a fishing rod as a reward.
[79:11.10]Yeah.
[79:12.34]Oh, there's like a spot right here.
[79:18.02]On the weapon wheel.
[79:18.96]Oh, shit.
[79:19.84]Oh, nice.
[79:20.12]There it is.
[79:22.38]Okay.
[79:23.20]Look for fishing spots.
[79:25.00]Each has opened the tackle box to equip the right fishing gear for the right fish and then cast the line.
[79:32.65]New toy!
[79:33.25]Oh, the tackle box.
[79:40.05]I didn't get the horse with that, right?
[79:41.35]Okay.
[79:41.61]Alright, tackle box.
[79:48.28]What are we looking for?
[79:48.82]We're looking for fish.
[79:51.46]Okay, let's put on a... I don't think you actually have to change anything because we... Oh, we don't have anything?
[79:56.48]Yeah, we don't have anything.
[79:57.50]I'm going to tell you if I have one.
[80:11.41]I don't... I don't want to catch the alligator.
[80:14.89]Cast it like... Okay.
[80:16.51]See, there's a fish right there.
[80:24.80]Alright, first person to... Got one!
[80:31.92]I got one.
[80:34.06]Do you?
[80:34.56]Yeah.
[80:35.44]You have to actually catch it, though.
[80:36.89]Hang on.
[80:37.19]I'm going to catch yours.
[80:38.51]No, get out of here.
[80:41.95]Doesn't look like you have one to me.
[80:43.49]I do.
[80:43.97]It's just like, I don't know.
[80:44.63]I'm trying to reel it in.
[80:45.31]I'm holding right trigger.
[80:46.73]I know.
[80:47.03]It's right click.
[80:47.59]Whatever.
[80:49.76]Come on.
[80:50.16]Get over here.
[80:50.56]Hey!
[80:54.79]You snapped the line.
[80:55.67]Fuck.
[80:57.79]One of us has to catch a fish.
[81:04.50]Alright, I got one.
[81:11.02]Wait, is it toggled?
[81:11.88]Is that the problem?
[81:12.78]Is that... Alright, please don't even tell me that's... Is that the problem?
[81:14.90]Is it because I have it toggled?
[81:16.78]Are you serious?
[81:17.96]You're just holding right click permanently?
[81:20.58]You might be.
[81:21.60]No, no way, right?
[81:24.76]Yep, that's what's happening.
[81:28.38]Poggle fishing.
[81:29.22]Alright, it's freaking me out because... That was such a far... Hold on, how far can you cast the line?
[81:40.86]No way, nobody's going to do it that far.
[81:43.63]Um... How do you... Okay, like...
[81:52.05]I got another one, but I gotta... Yeah, I see that.
[81:53.77]You see the lightning?
[81:55.11]Yeah, I saw the lightning.
[81:56.95]How do you get them to actually bite?
[81:58.23]You gotta, like, lure them in.
[82:00.01]You gotta, like, kind of wait.
[82:01.14]They'll come over.
[82:01.82]You'll see a little bit of water.
[82:03.64]Yeah, I see... And then... Can we get... Okay, I'm done.
[82:06.28]I fucking hate this.
[82:07.02]This is stupid.
[82:07.74]I'm fucking done with this stupid-ass goddamn minigame.
[82:09.48]It sucks.
[82:10.34]Put it away.
[82:11.02]I'm done.
[82:12.78]I'm done.
[82:13.99]I'm done.
[82:14.43]I don't want to do this.
[82:19.97]Oh, what a flop.
[82:27.36]Did he just drop my lightning?
[82:28.20]I can't put the fishing pole away.
[82:30.86]I know, yeah.
[82:31.81]I think you have to go into your, like, actual inventory and, like, it holds Q. Thank me once we've blasted through Castillo's blockade.
[82:40.43]See you on the other side, Danny.
[82:42.21]Well, neither of us captured Lufia.
[82:44.84]No, but it's alright.
[82:45.54]You have to, um, probably level the skill up.
[82:49.16]When are they gonna make, uh, like, Gamer Mouse that has Rumble?
[82:52.48]Oh, that would be awful.
[82:59.20]Your whole desk would vibrate.
[83:00.50]It would just be like... It would shake into your arm, and it would shake all through your desk and your monitors.
[83:08.62]That's why I can't tell when I caught a fish, because it was like... I couldn't tell the difference between a nibble and a bite.
[83:13.82]I need rumble on my mouse.
[83:15.86]We have to blow this stuff up.
[83:19.55]I still legitimately don't know how to put this fishing rod away.
[83:22.21]There we go.
[83:25.33]You hold Q. Alright, so we have to be careful, because we're about to...
[83:31.20]I don't know if that person sees us or... I think that person is... Is this... No, this is our car.
[83:37.91]Oh, I was wondering what the hell they were doing.
[83:39.81]They just like... They just like drop the car off in front of... Okay, this was a...
[83:53.39]Do you have anything?
[83:54.17]This guy just has a hat and like a t-shirt and like boots.
[83:57.71]We need to give this guy like a weapon.
[83:59.21]He's in the middle of like a car.
[84:00.17]Alright, where are you going?
[84:04.82]That's my chance.
[84:10.74]I need help.
[84:11.96]I need a hero.
[84:14.44]Got him.
[84:24.53]Nice work.
[84:25.05]Alright, let's go.
[84:28.27]We have to destroy that with explosives.
[84:33.63]I heard that guy.
[84:34.35]I'm going to lean out and snipe.
[84:38.39]Get us out of here.
[84:43.76]We have to destroy the big anti...
[84:51.80]Oh, I shot that guy into another dimension, dude.
[84:55.91]I had to shot that guy in his right ear so hard that it's pulled up.
[84:59.03]Okay, we got one.
[85:03.46]Oh my god.
[85:04.28]Okay, put out fire?
[85:09.12]What's five?
[85:12.42]What am I taping?
[85:13.62]Hey, Juan.
[85:15.65]Antioch off, Ganon's out.
[85:17.07]This guy is yours.
[85:22.81]Do you imagine you get burnt and you're like, oh, should I know duct tape?
[85:27.03]That'll do it.
[85:28.49]Take up the burn.
[85:29.57]Have you ever seen duct tape burn before?
[85:31.50]Alright.
[85:39.58]So that happened way too quickly.
[85:41.28]You just drove into that, exploded, and now we have to do another one?
[85:44.96]Yeah.
[85:45.80]Get the loot, though.
[85:47.92]Could be a toy in here.
[85:48.76]That's right.
[85:49.16]There's loot.
[85:55.17]What happens if you... Does it like share between us?
[85:57.73]I don't know.
[85:59.99]That's a good question.
[86:01.45]Probably.
[86:01.79]Okay.
[86:06.45]500 meters that way.
[86:07.98]How about... We get a boat?
[86:09.90]I feel like if we swim, we're going to get eaten by a shark.
[86:13.20]If you jump down there, you're doomed.
[86:24.37]What?
[86:29.24]Ah, sorry.
[86:31.20]Would you do C5?
[86:33.28]No, sorry.
[86:34.29]Yeah, you were close.
[86:35.25]You were close, though.
[86:36.79]My destroyer's close.
[86:37.75]Why don't you try a little bit closer until you're left?
[86:49.39]What's the plan here?
[86:50.21]What are you doing?
[86:51.15]What's wrong with me?
[86:54.86]You're just going deeper.
[86:55.76]Is this water toxic?
[86:56.74]What's going on?
[86:58.81]What's wrong with me?
[86:59.59]Can you see me?
[87:01.47]Yeah.
[87:01.81]What am I doing?
[87:02.39]Why am I... I can't breathe.
[87:04.87]Hold on.
[87:05.33]I'm not drowning.
[87:06.31]My head's above water.
[87:07.78]I think it's a good time to try the minigame.
[87:12.14]I can stand up here.
[87:15.36]Why would I be drowning?
[87:16.13]I can stand here.
[87:25.12]Nice.
[87:25.34]Alright.
[87:26.30]That just scared the shit out of me.
[87:27.70]I thought that was a fucking monster.
[87:29.92]What was that?
[87:31.50]What was that?
[87:34.51]What was that?
[87:34.93]Hey, you gonna get a nibble out here?
[87:38.65]I don't know what that was, but it was scary.
[87:42.67]Dude, I think the eye of Sauron just like looked over here.
[87:50.13]Hold on, I got something.
[87:55.00]What is hurting me?
[87:58.89]Huh?
[88:08.65]OH SHIT!
[88:10.69]ARE YOU DROWNING?
[88:14.92]GET HIM, GUAFFO!
[88:16.72]Is that a shark?
[88:19.68]Oh my god, that was terrifying.
[88:23.26]Yeah.
[88:25.12]Guapo was attacking something, and I thought he was biting me, but there was a shark in here trying to kill me.
[88:29.12]Hold on.
[88:30.58]I've got a fish.
[88:37.00]The line's gonna break.
[88:38.18]Guapo, stay with me, please.
[88:40.12]I need you.
[88:41.88]Oh, what a good boy.
[88:49.86]I'm gonna be the winner.
[88:53.22]I'm like about to be there.
[88:54.42]I'm the winner.
[88:56.93]I got a fish.
[88:57.99]Did you really?
[88:58.39]Yeah, I got a fish.
[88:59.75]What kind of fish?
[89:01.27]Um, a shark.
[89:06.03]Really, the big shark.
[89:08.55]I got a material.
[89:09.15]Did you actually get a shark?
[89:10.75]Yeah, it's huge.
[89:13.28]Oh, guapo, guapo, guapo.
[89:15.40]50 pounds.
[89:19.44]What is that?
[89:19.88]Is that what was attacking me?
[89:24.87]What is it?
[89:25.41]Oh, shit.
[89:26.13]Guapo, please.
[89:31.55]Come here.
[89:33.52]Can I just ride him?
[89:37.32]I'm about to be on the surface over here.
[89:43.14]Oh, interesting.
[89:45.44]Guapo, please.
[89:52.86]Come on!
[89:58.55]Guapo, please help me!
[90:00.51]I'm so close!
[90:01.23]Is that you?
[90:07.35]Yeah, the throw- actually, that's a good idea because you're gonna hit whatever's attacking me.
[90:10.15]Why am I still swimming?
[90:15.59]I just walked.
[90:21.44]No, but like I was still on my face in like eight inch water.
[90:28.62]I mean, I hope you had fun out there.
[90:29.96]It looked, uh, it looked pleasant.
[90:31.68]It was fun.
[90:45.31]Shoot the light out of the lighthouse.
[90:47.75]Uh, wild pigs?
[90:51.56]Oh my god.
[90:55.04]Yo, I don't want to like kill them.
[90:56.52]Am I just drinking a cigar?
[90:59.14]I just like drank a cigar.
[91:01.59]What was that?
[91:02.07]They're fighting Guapo.
[91:08.85]They just killed Guapo.
[91:10.05]What?
[91:10.31]You let them do this.
[91:15.85]How could they?
[91:18.89]It's okay, Guapo.
[91:22.45]There's a little cow in the back.
[91:25.91]Did you say we should shoot the light out?
[91:28.17]Yeah, shoot the light out of the lighthouse.
[91:32.44]I can't tell if it's a drop on bullets.
[91:36.76]I saw it done on one of the trailers.
[91:37.88]Just keep shooting.
[91:40.63]Should I actually do that or...
[91:51.57]I'm close to Castillo's ships.
[91:53.51]Muy bien, Danny.
[91:54.47]You'll be boarding those ships as our assault element.
[91:56.87]Julio, where are you?
[91:58.41]I'm in the... Oh, I want to hear.
[92:00.21]...with an RPG and perfect line of sight to the ships.
[92:03.49]Want to hear your voice, Raisa?
[92:05.28]Top of the tower, round the chamber, scope dialed in.
[92:08.38]Hit E. Oh, we got a new gun.
[92:11.94]Yeah, that's cool.
[92:12.90]New gun.
[92:15.88]Remember, we take those ships and we punch off...
[92:20.33]Okay, I love this comment.
[92:21.63]Somebody said, it's the house from the gamma correction screen.
[92:29.87]And I know exactly what you're talking about.
[92:32.49]You know, you get that, right?
[92:35.40]Like, adjust the brightness until you can see this, but you can't see that?
[92:39.00]Yeah, it is the gamma correction screen.
[92:41.54]How would you even catch that?
[92:43.42]What?
[92:44.30]How perceptive are you?
[92:45.76]It's crazy.
[92:50.58]They're the devs.
[92:51.16]Can I shoot somebody from here?
[92:57.25]Alright.
[92:57.49]We got to go up to the top of the lighthouse thing.
[93:06.96]Hold on.
[93:08.22]Wait a second.
[93:09.40]I love that Far Cry became so famous for jumping puzzles for tall things that they're like, yeah, fuck it.
[93:17.38]Let's just have them climb a rope to the top.
[93:21.38]Just skip everything.
[93:22.42]No more climbing.
[93:23.19]Just pull.
[93:28.65]We don't have time for these puzzles anymore.
[93:34.94]Danny, if you want to use your camera... Okay, I thought this was a bad guy.
[93:40.33]Look before you leap.
[93:41.21]Alright, clear the ship of... Clear both ships.
[93:43.77]If Lita was with us now, she'd be smiling.
[93:46.75]And halfway to those ships already.
[93:48.25]Okay.
[93:50.25]If Lita was here, I'd kick her ass for keeping you a secret.
[93:53.67]We have to parachute over?
[93:55.47]Do we?
[93:55.95]I was going to just snipe them.
[94:01.70]You want me to try to give you support?
[94:04.09]I already did a stealth mission.
[94:06.49]It's your turn.
[94:07.47]You want me to do the stealth mission part?
[94:08.69]I mean, do it however you want to do it.
[94:11.55]Okay, I'll try.
[94:12.15]Do you have a sniper rifle?
[94:15.59]I've got... Okay, I can mark waypoints for you.
[94:20.51]Okay, so... I'm going to try to stealth over there.
[94:23.84]So we have to clear both ships?
[94:27.24]Yeah, just do one, though.
[94:28.00]You don't have to do both.
[94:28.98]I'll come over after you to the closest one.
[94:37.52]I don't think this is enough.
[94:41.85]Are you holding W?
[94:44.43]Yes.
[94:49.91]I didn't have enough.
[94:53.41]I think it's okay because it's a thing to get up over here.
[95:01.13]Hoggle parachute.
[95:04.20]If I'm not gonna get attacked by a shark that's all I care about.
[95:07.59]I didn't see anybody on the first boat.
[95:10.47]There's a camera.
[95:11.77]There's a guy right here.
[95:12.49]Ladder?
[95:13.57]Where do you think I'm going?
[95:16.56]Oh, you found the second ladder.
[95:21.14]That's what I was about to do.
[95:38.79]Okay, do you got a good view?
[95:42.17]Can you see my waypoints?
[95:44.41]Okay, those are yours.
[95:47.52]Alright, I'm gonna... I don't know if I can kill these guys.
[95:49.94]What do you mean you don't know if you can kill them?
[95:51.48]I don't know.
[95:51.92]There's people everywhere.
[95:52.96]Is there a guy?
[95:56.08]Is there a guy over here on the right?
[95:58.34]On your right?
[95:59.94]No, there's a guy... The guy you're dead ahead.
[96:01.62]There's a guy to your left.
[96:03.77]Who saw me?
[96:09.61]Okay, good job.
[96:10.41]One down.
[96:12.35]There's the guy down below and the guy on the roof overlooking.
[96:17.51]Three guys in this little boat courtyard.
[96:20.01]I'm trying to dump the person over the edge.
[96:21.87]They're coming back.
[96:22.97]They're heading towards you.
[96:24.41]Oh, fuck.
[96:24.79]I'm trying to throw the guy over the edge.
[96:27.17]The sun's getting in my eyes.
[96:30.43]Somebody's up top.
[96:42.71]See you later, dickhead!
[96:48.17]Uh, I'm guessing the stealth part is over.
[96:53.35]I hear the alarm.
[96:55.44]Stealth is over.
[96:56.36]Oh, shit!
[97:04.40]That guy's at the helicopter.
[97:08.44]Did you see the helicopter?
[97:11.33]I think I got it taken care of.
[97:15.71]Kind of.
[97:20.67]I... Why would you put this here?
[97:24.61]Okay, what in God's fucking green Earth is this here for?
[97:28.83]This gate.
[97:29.61]You have a machine gun mounted up here.
[97:31.67]You're trying to block the view?
[97:33.77]What would you put this here for?
[97:35.00]What?! !
[97:40.39]Oh, are you down?
[97:42.13]Yes.
[97:46.98]Hold on, I got the hero music.
[97:48.26]You're blocking the mounted gun's view.
[97:51.32]My theme song is on.
[97:59.95]Thank you.
[98:01.87]Nice work.
[98:06.75]I want to grapple.
[98:20.06]That guy's not even here.
[98:21.04]He's underground.
[98:21.86]God damn it.
[98:23.86]I haven't done a single goddamn thing.
[98:28.03]There we go.
[98:28.43]Alright.
[98:29.19]One clear.
[98:30.21]Parachute.
[98:31.91]Where's the parachute?
[98:34.39]Help me.
[98:35.53]No, I'm dead.
[98:35.83]Never mind.
[98:36.99]I was trying to parachute down to the guy.
[98:40.25]I wanted to like parachute and swing down.
[98:45.34]Where am I?
[98:45.68]I'm inside of like a... I'm like left for dead.
[98:48.64]I'm inside of one of the like little supply closets.
[98:52.58]Seriously.
[98:53.26]Oh, what?
[98:59.48]Okay, one... Wait, why are you here?
[99:01.42]I just spawned next to you.
[99:03.64]Did you die?
[99:05.32]Yeah, I died.
[99:05.88]I tried to parachute down and I died.
[99:07.18]Alright, I'm gonna zip behind you.
[99:08.42]Hang on.
[99:08.80]You died again?
[99:09.34]Oh.
[99:11.43]Here comes... Here comes Robot Italian.
[99:16.86]We should have had to record stuff for this too.
[99:18.17]How are we supposed to get over the other side?
[99:29.05]I have a sniper rifle.
[99:29.95]What am I doing?
[99:30.31]Yeah, you got a sniper.
[99:31.17]I mean, it's not like it really matters.
[99:33.21]The thing doesn't really go that far.
[99:39.72]This is seriously what it feels like if it doesn't play PUBG.
[99:44.22]Two people just fucking shooting and missing over and over again.
[99:46.78]What happened?
[99:51.15]This is just like, okay, us sitting here sniping is like a shitty time crisis sequence.
[99:55.91]Okay, somebody is hitting us from somewhere.
[99:58.11]I don't know where.
[100:02.19]One dude's shooting RPGs from the lighthouse.
[100:05.38]Wait, he is?
[100:06.84]Yeah.
[100:07.82]He's hitting us.
[100:10.78]Fuck you, Danny.
[100:11.56]He's talking about us.
[100:15.84]We gotta go to the other boat.
[100:18.36]Wait, no.
[100:18.62]There's still people on this one.
[100:21.80]Did we clear it yet?
[100:22.64]Hold on.
[100:29.98]I think we can parachute out.
[100:31.14]This is not clear, though.
[100:31.96]There's still somebody on here.
[100:33.04]Oh, he's over here.
[100:35.32]I better have a parachute.
[100:38.39]They forgot to mention that there's about a staff of 150 people per boat in the military.
[100:47.03]There's too many people.
[100:51.37]They brought a helicopter.
[100:52.61]Oh, there's enemy choppers now.
[100:53.85]Are you fucking kidding me?
[101:14.84]Okay, got him.
[101:18.19]Hold on, I can do this.
[101:23.63]Oh, my God.
[101:24.45]How many?
[101:26.29]Did you shoot?
[101:26.89]That's our helicopter.
[101:27.43]That's a bad helicopter.
[101:28.43]It is?
[101:28.79]Yeah.
[101:48.81]I think the music has looped.
[101:50.97]At least one full time because we're taking too long.
[101:54.57]I swear to god I've heard like a... I think we got like the... You know when the music goes like... We got the full loop I think.
[102:15.66]This is like the... Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[102:17.14]There's actually a boat.
[102:18.70]Is there?
[102:18.92]A real boat.
[102:20.79]But I think our friendly helicopter is going to blow it up.
[102:23.63]Let's get it.
[102:23.95]Let's get it.
[102:25.29]Car shoot.
[102:28.21]Fuck you.
[102:29.15]No.
[102:29.67]What the hell?
[102:35.57]I'm just walking over there, man.
[102:37.29]I'm just going to walk over.
[103:03.84]Alex, how did the alligator get onto the boat?
[103:06.46]Does it use the ladder?
[103:12.34]Uh, probably.
[103:12.83]Clear!
[103:18.81]Clear!
[103:33.42]Yep!
[103:36.18]Cleared it out.
[103:41.21]More soldiers incoming.
[103:47.69]Where are you?
[103:48.56]I'm on the other boat.
[103:49.42]This could be good.
[103:50.56]It could be good?
[103:50.92]What are you thinking?
[103:53.20]I've got a swing spot.
[103:54.36]Alright, I'm looking at you.
[104:11.46]Break your legs.
[104:12.48]That was like a shattering sound.
[104:15.92]That was so loud.
[104:17.24]I love how it was like at 14 frames a second.
[104:23.68]Oh, wait.
[104:23.92]Here's the bad guy.
[104:24.52]Here's the bad guy.
[104:24.94]This is the guy we have to kill.
[104:28.31]I'm going to fucking nuke this guy.
[104:29.51]Nuke him.
[104:33.53]I don't have any bullets.
[104:36.31]What the fuck?
[104:37.31]How come I can't do this?
[104:41.77]Help!
[104:42.49]Help!
[104:43.31]Help!
[104:46.12]He's dead.
[104:46.96]Good job.
[104:53.46]Alright, there can't be that many more.
[104:54.86]We've probably taken out most of the Navy.
[105:00.21]What about these guys?
[105:16.55]Hey, come a little earlier next time.
[105:22.01]Just like the cavalry, showing up late and claiming all the credit.
[105:34.78]My game crashed.
[105:39.84]Did it?
[105:40.38]What's happening?
[105:41.98]What the fuck?
[105:42.46]I mean, it's one out of two.
[105:43.48]There's got to be like one guy left.
[105:47.09]That was weird.
[105:58.14]I'm bored.
[105:59.32]It's okay.
[106:02.82]It's okay.
[106:03.44]Where is this last person?
[106:05.02]I did it.
[106:05.79]Did you get it?
[106:07.45]Yeah.
[106:08.31]We did it.
[106:15.66]Both ships clear to soldiers guerrilla boats can now escape.
[106:18.90]Okay, and Maybe we'll get picked up I
[106:47.85]I'm alive.
[106:48.23]Don't worry.
[106:48.55]It was a joke.
[106:49.19]Where are you, Clara?
[106:53.01]How do we get off of this?
[106:58.63]Reach Clara's boat.
[107:03.25]Oh, she's coming.
[107:10.46]We made it.
[107:14.08]Leave a lever sad, Danny.
[107:18.80]You know, one of these times we're going to do that and the main character's body is going to be lying on the ground.
[107:23.10]Oh, shit.
[107:25.58]Oh, boat sequence?
[107:28.28]Holy shit, we just made it out of there.
[107:32.04]Hell of a fireworks show.
[107:34.04]I have to give you credit, Clara.
[107:35.76]You fucking did it.
[107:37.04]We did it, Danny.
[107:38.26]That was the difference.
[107:39.52]What's your plan when you reach America?
[107:41.45]What did she do?
[107:42.23]She didn't do shit.
[107:43.01]He came to rescue us with a boat.
[107:45.67]Open a body shop.
[107:47.27]If the Yankee blockade taught us anything, it's how to keep things running when you got nothing.
[107:52.54]That's the dream?
[107:54.60]Sure, Yankees might pay you to park their cars or pick their fruit, but you'll never be one of them.
[108:00.24]The American dream doesn't come in our color.
[108:02.48]Okay.
[108:03.36]If we're shitting on dreams, what are you going to do if you win?
[108:06.80]Who are the people in the boats back here?
[108:08.72]The next president won't last six months before they are assassinated.
[108:11.84]Were they on the boat?
[108:13.41]They're in fisher boats.
[108:14.87]You ever see Dunkirk?
[108:16.33]Whoa, whoa.
[108:17.61]It's a vision, Danny.
[108:19.03]But I'm not as naive as you think.
[108:20.95]This revolution will free Yara, but won't fix it.
[108:24.05]When we take the capital, Yara will be burning.
[108:27.53]What in the sky?
[108:30.71]Birds.
[108:31.27]Just wait until birds get smart enough to do this shit and shape into like a middle finger or something.
[108:36.22]Just wait until they get that kind of sentience.
[108:38.60]is stuck in a cycle of tyranny and revolution my job is to show us how to that's why we're making drones I mean they're just like birds but you have to do this more controllable no one would choose this no danny everyone who follows me who joins libertad chooses this but you know birds aren't real birds are drones
[109:03.42]I want to look forward.
[109:05.10]I don't like looking this way.
[109:06.22]That was the camera where we're doing the joke where we're going to crash and we're not looking.
[109:09.90]I know, but I want to be in control of that, not her.
[109:34.42]I think we got, uh, imprisoned.
[109:40.74]Wait.
[109:41.38]What happened?
[109:41.96]Oh, maybe we... No, uh, we, uh, can we... We can't skip this one.
[109:47.45]We can't skip this one.
[109:48.81]Do, uh... Uh, let's, uh, should we at least, let's watch this one.
[109:56.29]Oh, man.
[109:57.31]I haven't even seen this actor on screen yet, so I kind of want to.
[110:03.97]understands that loyalty to country is key to his survival.
[110:08.85]Not justice, not love, not even family.
[110:12.60]Loyalty to a vision that looks beyond themselves.
[110:17.72]Come mierda.
[110:20.18]Fake Yharnams love to be the outcasts.
[110:23.19]What was the subtitle?
[110:23.69]What's going on with the subtitles?
[110:24.77]It's like the last line goes to the top just in case you read really slow.
[110:30.07]That's not on the screen right now.
[110:31.00]That's a lot of words for that sentence.
[110:52.48]Can you imagine if you didn't, like, if you were on a different language and you didn't understand it and you thought this is all they said?
[110:58.58]Put Julio down.
[111:00.74]You would think, like, oh, wow, that's all they said here.
[111:03.02]Okay.
[111:06.01]This is a difficult step to Paradise, Mio.
[111:08.49]I understand.
[111:10.07]Somebody's still saying it.
[111:11.63]Our vision, I promise you, there will be no more steps.
[111:19.32]And if a dog refuses to break, there will be no more steps.
[111:22.58]And if a dog refuses to break, that's how each one of these is starting.
[111:27.62]Yeah, like the last words of the last sentence start the next line.
[111:32.48]And if a dog refuses to break.
[111:34.82]Enjoy the show.
[111:45.19]That's the comic book punch.
[111:47.79]By the way, that person's dead.
[111:50.23]You know what I mean?
[111:51.03]They always do that in movies and TV shows.
[111:52.44]Oh, I'm going to have the butt of the pistol or the rifle.
[111:55.32]I'm going to hit you in the head like 12 times.
[111:56.94]That person is dead.
[111:57.42]Why don't they just bring a club if they're going to do that?
[112:02.35]Bring like a stick.
[112:02.77]I don't get it.
[112:11.77]Julio checked in.
[112:13.21]Proof of death.
[112:14.17]Join your friend Lita in a suite hereafter.
[112:16.09]I keep my promises, Danny.
[112:18.15]You wanted a boat, you got a boat.
[112:20.07]This is the one.
[112:21.51]Subterranean missile launching helicopter boat.
[112:24.59]Is it really?
[112:25.77]You two are just going to let me leave.
[112:27.75]Bullshit.
[112:28.59]You could have sold us out a long time ago.
[112:30.69]Alright, so we kind of get what happened.
[112:35.95]Ooh.
[112:42.31]I'm driving the boat from back here?
[112:45.09]Yeah, where the engine block is.
[112:46.81]How do you drive?
[112:49.29]Wait, are you fucking with me or are you actually driving?
[112:50.63]Are you driving?
[112:51.87]You're driving.
[112:52.92]I am?
[112:53.16]Yeah, you.
[112:58.56]Military presence increased.
[112:59.84]Is there a horn?
[113:04.18]I don't think there's a horn.
[113:10.02]Okay, well this was fun, but we'd have to go over here.
[113:15.60]Don't be, okay.
[113:17.20]We're gonna get, you can respawn it a thousand times.
[113:19.53]Is this?
[113:20.81]Cars respawn, don't worry.
[113:24.43]Man, they really got the budget for this Far Cry, am I right?
[113:27.47]I mean, look at this boat.
[113:40.63]Wait, where is this?
[113:43.59]Can't we just dig?
[113:44.21]Ugh, whatever.
[113:45.77]Wait, let's go over here.
[113:48.51]Like, I swear to God, that person is so... If I put my mouth to the ground and went like... They'd probably hear us.
[113:55.44]And I could be like, where do you want us to go next?
[113:58.42]I could put my ear on the ground and they could yell it.
[114:00.82]I mean, that's how they communicated before cell phones.
[114:03.22]Ow, what the fuck?
[114:07.42]See, it's... Well, that's concrete.
[114:08.82]Never mind.
[114:13.35]Alright, let's work.
[114:18.97]Alright, let's work.
[114:21.33]What's the job?
[114:25.95]Can you hear this?
[114:27.49]I don't hear anything.
[114:29.14]He's only giving the quest to me.
[114:31.32]Oh.
[114:32.04]I'm just going to start taking stuff.
[114:42.48]Whatever.
[114:50.73]He said before we can do the next mission, we need to have the achievements for beating Far Cry 5.
[114:56.48]What?
[114:59.18]Primary weapon to... Alright, look.
[115:00.42]I'll get a new gun here.
[115:01.32]Let's put it on.
[115:01.76]Attachments.
[115:04.22]Yeah, looks good.
[115:04.78]Alright.
[115:08.04]I want to use this thing.
[115:11.25]What slot is it in?
[115:13.75]He also said he needs both of us to do the Voss definition of insanity line.
[115:20.68]Uh, this is the definition of insanity.
[115:25.98]Sorry, was that like the Shakespearean interpretation?
[115:29.17]It was me just saying it.
[115:30.47]To move on and go.
[115:34.27]Oh, we get different supreme... Whoa, what are these weapons?
[115:41.38]EMP pulse to knock over enemies.
[115:44.12]Chaos by launching poison ga... I don't need to hear anything else.
[115:47.04]I just want that one.
[115:50.88]What is this one?
[115:52.08]Resolve Equipment?
[115:52.98]I don't know what this thing is.
[115:57.25]I got the gas one.
[116:00.23]Which?
[116:01.99]There's a gas one.
[116:03.71]Yeah, Poison Gas.
[116:05.33]Oh, Poison Gas.
[116:06.49]Okay.
[116:09.15]Does that just equip now?
[116:16.63]Resolve Equipment.
[116:17.49]I want to go look out and see what this thing does.
[116:20.21]Which one?
[116:20.66]I'll pick a different one.
[116:21.32]Which one did you get?
[116:22.06]I got the one that looks like a wrench.
[116:23.82]Number two.
[116:28.96]Oh, okay.
[116:29.40]What is it?
[116:30.30]Flamethrower.
[116:31.68]Alright, that's the thing I just got.
[116:34.69]So what's this resolver weapon?
[116:36.05]How do we use it?
[116:45.90]You probably have to go into the inventory and equip it.
[116:49.14]In the armory?
[116:51.05]Armory?
[116:52.55]You have to equip it.
[116:54.37]The arsenal?
[116:57.59]Like in your actual arsenal?
[116:59.55]Okay, yeah, I see.
[117:03.99]What's the other thing do?
[117:06.77]I don't want the flamethrower anymore.
[117:09.78]Put this thing on.
[117:10.36]It's a crossbow.
[117:11.04]I'm done with you.
[117:15.02]This might be kind of fun.
[117:17.06]It sounds like the Ubisoft people playing with the ad.
[117:19.58]You know what?
[117:20.05]Whatever.
[117:21.75]I'm going to be wicked low fucking energy for the rest of the stream.
[117:24.01]You ready?
[117:24.39]Okay.
[117:25.57]Alright, dude.
[117:26.27]You ready?
[117:26.51]Let's go.
[117:30.45]I don't know.
[117:31.47]You sure?
[117:32.24]Yeah.
[117:32.40]Do you really?
[117:33.48]Okay.
[117:35.06]Let's... I got this cool thing here.
[117:38.00]So where are we going to go?
[117:41.82]Oh, yeah.
[117:42.27]Actually, I'm going to take a shit for like 30 minutes, and then I'm going to go make some dinner.
[117:46.01]Then I'm going to take my dog out, and then I'm going to run some errands, and then I'll play co-op with you again, I promise.
[117:51.15]Nah, I'm good.
[117:53.14]I'm good.
[117:54.96]I'll talk to you later, though.
[117:56.28]I'll talk to you at some point.
[118:00.42]Thanks for playing.
[118:01.16]Alright, we've got to go over here.
[118:12.79]Where's my chat?
[118:13.65]I can't see anything.
[118:15.81]Is there anything that you can relate to more than getting a co-op game with your friend and you guys play it one time and then you never play it again ever?
[118:24.87]That's every experience ever.
[118:26.39]We need to know this.
[118:27.21]This is important.
[118:38.17]I like that they're all scrapbookers.
[118:42.87]It's good to have some hobbies that you can do when you're waiting for your friends to log on so they'll play co-op with you again.
[118:50.24]This does look like a scrapbook.
[118:58.96]That means targeted operations that will unite the revolution and make Libertad stronger.
[119:04.88]To do that, I need you to recruit three groups in Yara to fight with Libertad.
[119:09.49]Each is waging war across Yara with a different piece of Castillo's empire.
[119:12.21]Okay, so there's more islands.
[119:12.85]We're on the tiny island.
[119:14.35]What are these subtitles?
[119:15.43]I should turn these off.
[119:17.72]What's going on?
[119:18.44]The moral of the story is we're on the tutorial island.
[119:21.34]If you guys get this game, I hope you enjoy these islands.
[119:24.55]And these other places.
[119:25.45]Aren't we going there now?
[119:36.05]This is the demo.
[119:37.37]We're giving you the demo of the game.
[119:39.39]So you can decide if you want to buy it or not.
[119:40.83]Because you're not going to see any of these places.
[119:44.24]I thought we were going there like now.
[119:45.86]Are we going here right now?
[119:47.06]Why are they telling us about all the leaders if we're not?
[119:49.68]I don't know.
[119:50.38]There's like a leader in each zone.
[119:52.95]And for some reason, the, like, HQ of the resistance is right in the middle.
[120:02.51]Conveniently located.
[120:05.44]People are saying, this is really confusing.
[120:09.64]Well, we're not making this any easier.
[120:11.36]We're skipping every cutscene.
[120:13.58]We're not making it really easy for you to pay attention.
[120:18.69]But the Montero family is waging war against Jose.
[120:22.09]They hate visitors, but I have intel on a mechanic who has a workshop in Costa del Mar.
[120:26.89]His name is Philly Varsaga, and he's their gatekeeper.
[120:30.26]Okay, can we get a helicopter and just fly to the leader's, like, compound and just drop, like, a missile?
[120:35.86]Isn't this what the boat's for, probably?
[120:39.92]You just need to find this mechanic, Philly.
[120:42.48]I'll be here actioning targeted Libertad strikes against Castillo throughout Yara.
[120:47.88]Hang on.
[120:48.82]I'm going to get all these groups to sign up to Liberta by myself?
[120:52.78]How?
[120:53.65]Simple.
[120:54.73]You help.
[120:55.81]We're going to get a change.org petition going.
[120:58.13]There's a lot of people we have to go get.
[121:00.45]We're going to get a lot of these.
[121:01.26]There's a lot of people here.
[121:04.95]I send a squad to these groups.
[121:06.41]I'm an invader.
[121:07.47]I send a scout, then I'm not serious.
[121:09.25]With you, they get my best career without politics and bullshit.
[121:12.87]Just help.
[121:13.71]We got a pretty good idea.
[121:15.07]Oh, I tried.
[121:15.57]I tried to skip earlier.
[121:16.53]Alright.
[121:17.15]Oh, we have a real boat.
[121:18.05]Ooh.
[121:35.33]Okay, now we're talking.
[121:36.77]Now we actually are talking.
[121:38.42]Meet the legends, okay?
[121:40.88]Meet the Monteros.
[121:44.66]Oh god, this did just open up.
[121:47.56]Alright, where do you want to go first?
[121:49.96]Uh, yeah, I think we can go wherever.
[121:51.92]Extra content now available.
[121:58.50]You want to go up?
[121:59.49]Down?
[121:59.77]What do you think?
[122:01.31]Hold on.
[122:04.83]I have a new friend.
[122:13.17]Pete the Elbertsons.
[122:18.00]Where's my new friend?
[122:18.72]What do you mean, new friend?
[122:22.40]I have a new buddy.
[122:25.00]Somewhere.
[122:28.34]Oh, we can call for our boats now.
[122:31.85]Hola, guerrilla.
[122:32.97]Oye.
[122:36.07]Okay.
[122:37.89]Do you want to get in the boat?
[122:38.97]Let's go this way.
[122:40.23]Yeah.
[122:40.73]What do I have?
[122:41.25]Okay.
[122:41.57]Hold on.
[122:43.05]Did you buy this game?
[122:43.87]Because I didn't buy it.
[122:45.21]I did the, like, Ubisoft subscription thing for, like, one month.
[122:51.42]What is that?
[122:51.84]You know, like, EA play?
[122:58.07]Yeah?
[122:58.41]And apparently it unlocks like every premium thing.
[123:03.06]So hold on.
[123:03.38]I'm about to show you how ridiculous this shit is.
[123:05.24]What?
[123:06.26]Hold on.
[123:07.96]I'm about to do like a Sea of Thieves cosmetic... You have like a Kano eye.
[123:15.04]Hold on.
[123:15.80]I haven't even finished yet.
[123:20.88]How much do you... Hold on.
[123:23.55]I need you to, while you're doing that, I need you to explain to me very slowly so I can keep up and understand.
[123:29.16]You're paying a monthly subscription to Ubisoft to play, like, three games that come out.
[123:33.52]No, no, no, no, no.
[123:34.40]You must understand.
[123:35.46]Please correct me.
[123:36.34]I paid $15 so I could play this for one stream, and then I'm just gonna unsubscribe before the next month charges me.
[123:43.16]Okay, but is that what the service is?
[123:46.63]It's to, like, play Ubisoft games, like, as a subscription?
[123:50.62]Yeah.
[123:51.48]Yeah.
[123:52.42]That's that seemed that's impossible.
[123:54.42]I don't believe you.
[123:55.66]That's what I mean.
[123:56.36]They gave me the super look at my look at my hand.
[123:58.22]I have a robot hand.
[124:00.04]Hold on.
[124:00.54]Hold on.
[124:01.22]Look, look, look.
[124:03.44]What is it doing there?
[124:05.84]No, no, no.
[124:06.44]Behind you.
[124:11.60]What?
[124:11.80]It has a QR code around its collar.
[124:16.98]Really?
[124:26.11]It's like a sad robot.
[124:27.47]So it's $15 a month and you get to play any Ubisoft game you want.
[124:32.57]I guess, yeah.
[124:33.24]Why are you saying it like we're doing a sponsored segment?
[124:35.92]Because I'm trying to understand because you can get every Ubisoft game that probably ever came out on like sales.
[124:44.32]Oh, I also apparently unlocked like new weapons.
[124:50.08]How many new weapons did I get?
[124:55.44]this really is like I use my cheat code I'm the guy standing behind the person cooking the food in the infomercial going now hold on a second kathy you're hold on you're telling me that this can cook rice and can cook chicken at the same time explain that to me I don't understand
[125:12.27]What the f- Okay, this game sucks.
[125:14.43]This is stupid.
[125:14.95]I hate this.
[125:16.45]I don't like it anymore.
[125:18.07]I don't like this game anymore.
[125:19.24]I got a Winchester.
[125:21.08]Get out of here.
[125:21.90]Get out of here with your Ubisoft subscription character.
[125:25.00]Hang on, I got a double barrel shotgun.
[125:26.84]This is stupid.
[125:27.68]This is not fair.
[125:30.12]I paid $60 for this game.
[125:31.66]How much did you pay for it again?
[125:32.68]Say it again.
[125:33.00]I got a gold-plated scorpion.
[125:36.09]This was $15?
[125:36.41]Yeah, I got $15.
[125:38.73]I paid three, four times as much as you did for this game.
[125:43.62]Okay, but I mean, nothing's stopping you from getting premium currency and just going ahead and buying it and adding these cosmetic items to your game.
[125:54.31]What the hell?
[125:54.91]You could just pay more, and then you could unlock them permanently.
[126:05.34]were supposed to buy the 200 edition I am so confused I didn't think that was a thing is that why they made their own launcher is that why they really like leaned into like the uplay connect thing uh that's probably just because steam takes like 20 of the profit on everything but but didn't we did I bought this oh my god what happened
[126:29.15]Okay, there are two objects in the vast ocean that could possibly be hit.
[126:37.50]And you have hit both of them.
[126:40.90]Statistically, if you use the whole surface area, it's like a 0.0001% chance to hit those boats.
[126:49.69]I am still so fucking... I'm floored by this whole Ubisoft thing.
[126:53.03]I'm sorry.
[126:53.59]I just am.
[126:55.15]I mean, you could probably access the Uplay shop in the game, I bet.
[126:59.52]Because you could in Assassin's Creed.
[127:04.16]How many games does Ubisoft think they're going to release?
[127:08.66]I don't know.
[127:11.36]That wasn't even my only costume.
[127:14.30]I have three.
[127:17.86]How many games does Ubisoft release a year?
[127:21.27]Uh, three, four, maybe two, two or three.
[127:25.97]The leader of a group of farmers trying to take back their land from the army, but he'll never meet with you.
[127:32.72]Why not?
[127:33.62]He's what you would call old school.
[127:37.24]Alright, look, let me show you my other one.
[127:40.00]And the cyberpunk one was pretty.
[127:41.62]This one's going to make you mad too, but for a different reason.
[127:45.56]You're doing more crazy things now?
[127:58.01]What?
[127:58.29]You get like a cool... You get like laser cannons and cool costumes and I get like a fucking crossbow that was made out of a toaster?
[128:10.57]Okay, let's go.
[128:19.26]We need a car.
[128:20.74]Listen, okay?
[128:22.14]I just want to be clear.
[128:23.66]We're trying to usurp the government while also taking part in beautiful capitalism.
[128:29.73]I don't... Listen, look at these beautiful shoes and my watch.
[128:34.01]Solid gold.
[128:37.93]Let's go.
[128:38.53]Listen, only the capitalist could have come up with his laser gun with magnetic reload.
[128:47.61]I just put the magazine close and it sucks it in.
[128:50.32]Oh, holster.
[128:51.22]Holster that so this guy doesn't get mad.
[128:52.52]Hey, why don't you use your, like, cool new gun on this guy?
[128:57.72]What the fuck was that?
[129:00.36]That's so loud.
[129:01.58]Is it $15 to get loud?
[129:02.94]I just pet this lady.
[129:04.50]What?
[129:05.14]Wait, no.
[129:05.76]What is going on?
[129:08.08]I thought I was pet.
[129:09.14]Why do I have the option?
[129:11.32]What is happening?
[129:12.34]Get away from me.
[129:18.70]Why?
[129:19.58]Why?
[129:19.80]Okay, I was so confused.
[129:23.54]Your gun is too loud.
[129:24.88]I don't care how much it costs.
[129:26.30]Get out of here!
[129:31.34]Get this lady out of here!
[129:36.37]This lady's a fucking menace.
[129:37.49]We gotta get rid of her.
[129:42.09]That's the wrong person.
[129:45.81]That's the quest.
[129:52.18]What the hell?
[129:54.26]They're too loud.
[129:55.20]You paid more money to be louder than me.
[129:59.18]Nobody's louder than me.
[129:59.96]I'm one of the loudest, most annoying streamers on Twitch.
[130:02.32]Don't you get it?
[130:03.04]You're not allowed to be louder than me.
[130:05.06]What does this do?
[130:07.88]She's back.
[130:08.18]You're not that loud.
[130:22.36]Don't!
[130:27.61]Why did your horse just fuck you off?
[130:29.85]I don't know, maybe it's the fact that there was an explosion that happened five feet away from me?
[130:33.37]Alright, we have to make contact with Philly.
[130:39.35]Shit!
[130:40.43]It's okay, I'll use pay-to-win robo-dog.
[130:50.84]Okay, are you ready?
[131:01.37]Yeah, I'm ready.
[131:05.89]I just like gassed everybody.
[131:07.97]Why'd you gas all of us?
[131:09.77]I don't know.
[131:10.27]Also, I don't have a horse somehow in that mayhem.
[131:13.60]Yeah, I wanted to go get a robot one from the fucking store.
[131:17.38]There probably is one.
[131:18.36]Rocket's on its back.
[131:20.16]Hold on, did I get a super rocket too?
[131:26.76]No.
[131:29.25]I think we can probably... I think we can take this over.
[131:32.11]There's a helicopter here, dude.
[131:35.15]We have to take this place out.
[131:37.09]Let's do this slowly and actually methodically.
[131:38.77]Let's actually do this correctly.
[131:39.68]Okay, really?
[131:40.24]There's a helicopter right here.
[131:42.72]Actually sneak and do this correctly.
[131:45.00]Okay.
[131:45.84]I'll, uh... I'll do some spying.
[131:48.96]No off any reason the military would take over a weather station.
[131:52.20]You're in the west, right?
[131:53.96]I've been wondering about that place myself.
[131:56.20]See if you can find a computer.
[131:57.88]They must be logging whatever... Okay, climb.
[132:00.20]Sure.
[132:00.78]I'll take a look around.
[132:02.44]Can I just climb up here and claim this?
[132:07.07]Is there anybody up on this tower?
[132:13.83]I don't see anybody.
[132:17.57]Oh, there are a couple people.
[132:19.27]It looks pretty open.
[132:20.41]There's just a guy on the roof.
[132:22.09]Is there a guy on the roof?
[132:23.57]How do I get up on that side?
[132:24.57]Not of that building.
[132:26.07]There's a guy on the roof to your right.
[132:28.46]How do I get up there?
[132:31.06]Oh, okay, yeah.
[132:33.96]I don't know what this guy's doing, but... You're asking about shooting somebody on a ladder?
[132:41.19]Well, that guy wasn't technically on a ladder.
[132:51.34]Alright, I'm just gonna go over here.
[133:00.13]I think they see you getting in the helicopter.
[133:02.25]I'm gonna try to cover you.
[133:06.99]Uh, it said anti-aircraft covers the skies.
[133:10.50]I'll go up.
[133:13.94]I need cover!
[133:15.78]Oh shit.
[133:16.58]Don't take a picture with your fucking gu- What?! !
[133:25.19]You good?
[133:27.59]Doesn't look like it.
[133:29.59]Oh, you're not good.
[133:30.35]You're not good.
[133:39.08]Damn it.
[133:41.16]I thought it already blew up.
[133:42.16]It wasn't exploded yet?
[133:44.26]How did you even get up there?
[133:45.28]Uh, climb the tower.
[133:46.74]Oh, you're already dead.
[133:50.15]That was a named guy.
[133:54.84]You're... This is fucked up.
[134:00.58]Um... Hey, Guapo is down.
[134:03.46]You... I'm ha- I'm coming, I'm coming.
[134:09.40]So how do we claim this place?
[134:20.80]Do we have to go in and like... Break something or grab something?
[134:25.09]Or is it just kill the people?
[134:29.11]I think this is just a random outpost.
[134:32.61]I think we can actually do something here, right?
[134:34.29]Like turn off.
[134:34.81]Okay, hold on.
[134:35.23]Interact.
[134:35.53]Here we go.
[134:37.01]Alright.
[134:37.35]Access.
[134:37.63]This is Chopper.
[134:39.47]I literally pressed Q-W-P-O-Q-L-P-O-P-O-Q-W-1-2-0-0-5.
[134:43.85]That's what I pressed.
[134:46.23]I don't even know what buttons.
[134:48.33]I just pressed random ones.
[134:49.27]Why did you say your password in chat?
[134:50.37]I have to give him everything that's happened recently.
[134:54.86]It's connecting?
[134:55.64]Okay, connecting.
[135:05.22]Alright, is it still connecting?
[135:14.11]Where's the mouse?
[135:14.87]Yeah, where's the mouse?
[135:16.99]How long does it take to connect?
[135:24.00]Somebody's coughing in here.
[135:25.26]Alright, what's... Does this go through glass?
[135:28.08]Oh, that's not good.
[135:28.90]This is a helicopter.
[135:30.89]I know this is a helicopter.
[135:31.85]I've been trying to shoot the pilot out.
[135:34.35]I, like, hacked this thing, but I don't know if it's doing anything.
[135:37.49]It says connected.
[135:38.59]Oh.
[135:41.27]What's down here?
[135:43.89]I'm gonna blow up the helicopter before I kill this guy.
[135:47.57]Um, I just went underground.
[135:52.50]Wait, where's my pay-to-win sniper?
[136:01.49]He's just patiently waiting.
[136:02.91]I feel like I'm watching the intro of a TV show.
[136:05.69]So much shit is on the top left of my screen.
[136:09.23]It's as if it's telling me who made the game and shit.
[136:12.43]Are you dead?
[136:14.22]I went down.
[136:15.06]I'm collecting military ingredients.
[136:20.12]I don't know.
[136:20.40]Whatever it is.
[136:23.24]There's a little building you can go in and I went down into the basement.
[136:28.31]I can't see a single thing.
[136:29.73]There's a lot of stuff down here.
[136:34.00]Okay, I think I got everything.
[136:37.87]Woppo is down.
[136:40.91]Um... Should I... NAA.
[136:46.85]Are you okay up there?
[136:48.09]No.
[136:48.82]No.
[136:52.36]There's a lot of people.
[136:58.40]Wait, I got a bunker keycard.
[137:03.32]Hang on, uh, is there a pop-up on my screen that says if I just put my credit card info in right now, I can actually buy a revive?
[137:09.39]I wouldn't be surprised.
[137:11.99]Bunker keycard, come on.
[137:13.19]They got me something cool here.
[137:14.95]There's about six people on my corpse.
[137:17.37]What the fuck?
[137:21.10]I... Alright, I'm just coming up.
[137:22.62]I have no idea.
[137:23.54]There's, uh, seven people on my body.
[137:30.42]Okay, I got a key card.
[137:32.42]Oh, you're dead?
[137:33.04]Okay, I'm helping.
[137:33.70]Oh my god, alright.
[137:36.56]Do you have any missiles or anything heavy?
[137:44.43]Yup.

[138:27.64]Are you still alive?
[138:29.61]momentarily.
[138:33.36]That was a nice slide.
[138:36.46]Yep.
[138:36.56]Alright.

[140:28.16]The guilt finally caught up with me.
[140:30.40]You're buying more?
[140:31.06]No, I've just been using the ones... I've just been using the ones that I already had.
[140:41.50]Alright, this is restricted airspace, so we have to get the hell out of here fast.
[140:46.20]We just captured it.
[140:47.18]It's ours.
[140:48.08]Apparently it's not.
[140:49.30]I guess not.
[140:51.54]Are you over here?
[140:52.32]Can you get in here?
[140:53.46]Yeah, one sec.
[141:03.89]Nice.
[141:04.11]Alright.
[141:06.59]Wait, someone's noticing us.
[141:07.67]How do you fly?
[141:09.41]We've been seen by... Alright, go.
[141:15.72]I'm just trying to get out of the airspace.
[141:20.56]Got it.
[141:21.24]We're out.
[141:24.77]Alright, hell yeah.
[141:26.97]That's kind of sad that our Guapos are running.
[141:31.85]They'll catch up if they can see us.
[141:33.13]Alright, let me get the controls here.
[141:36.59]Okay, descend and ascend.
[141:38.63]It's like WASD, so it's just forward, back, left, right, and then space control.
[141:45.32]K9000 just died, so I guess they weren't fine.
[141:48.50]How do I turn?
[141:49.08]Oh, I have to actually be... Okay, I'm gonna get a free look.
[141:52.84]Alright, let's go.
[141:58.72]Let's fly to the mission.
[141:59.46]Alright, let's try not to break this.
[142:11.10]You look like you just went to a rave.
[142:14.69]I do?
[142:15.47]You look like you just went to like Burning Man.
[142:18.13]I don't know why I thought it said E exit vehicle slash freak out.
[142:30.71]I'm gonna try to do this very carefully.
[142:33.95]What kind of person works in a place like this?
[142:42.95]Oh, I didn't even get to land it.
[142:47.25]Press E just to fucking lose it.
[142:49.57]Are you Philly?
[142:50.29]I'm Danny.
[142:51.27]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[142:54.66]Exactly what I would have done.
[142:55.42]I like this character.
[143:00.10]Whoa, I've seen your back.
[143:07.84]Billy said she was seen at the tobacco plantation.
[143:09.92]Alright, let's go.
[143:11.28]What happened to the chopper?
[143:12.68]I don't know.
[143:17.07]It's apparently gone.
[143:17.65]I guess I'll have to make do with this.
[143:21.45]If you bring this vehicle to a pickup point, you can call it in whenever you want.
[143:27.77]Can you slash DMCA, Jordan?
[143:29.93]Hold on.
[143:33.65]Hold on.
[143:34.03]Hold on.
[143:34.31]Hold on.
[143:34.49]Hold on.
[143:34.73]There's a plane.
[143:37.53]Yeah.
[143:40.60]On to the next toy.
[143:42.06]That's all we care about.
[143:43.10]Oh, wow.
[143:45.98]A toy.
[143:46.50]Can we both get in this?
[143:50.44]Oops.
[143:50.88]This is back.
[143:52.22]You're in the back?
[143:52.74]Yeah, you're the pilot.
[143:54.11]I'm facing backwards.
[144:00.27]Okay, how do I fly it?
[144:02.83]Restricted airspace is on your radar.
[144:06.52]Accelerate.
[144:07.52]De-accelerate.
[144:09.80]Yeah, and then pitch.
[144:12.34]Um, I don't know what that does.
[144:16.36]Holy fucking smokes, dude.
[144:17.84]Are you kidding me?
[144:19.76]We actually just do that?
[144:21.52]From a takeoff?
[144:22.50]This is a vertical takeoff and landing.
[144:28.92]Hitch and yaw.
[144:30.72]I'm trying, man.
[144:32.14]Press E to shoot.
[144:34.09]Press E to shoot.
[144:34.87]Press E to shoot.
[144:58.04]Oh fuck, we're gonna get fin- Oh no, I didn't mean to do that, I'm sorry!
[145:01.32]You're in trouble!
[145:11.30]I'm sorry.
[145:12.06]I'm sorry.
[145:12.96]That was it.
[145:13.54]That was a full-on painful.
[145:15.52]Yeah, that was a big one It went down so fast.
[145:17.24]Hey, you want to see my new trick?
[145:22.22]Yes, I do.
[145:22.90]I am Iron Man 1.
[145:40.39]Oh my god.
[145:41.83]That's all it does.
[145:42.73]Uh, what is that?
[145:49.58]Oh shit!
[145:52.06]Whose plane is this?
[146:04.08]Okay.
[146:04.60]I'm out of ammo.
[146:07.06]We got him.
[146:08.56]Nope.
[146:10.60]Oh, they're coming back.
[146:16.12]What was that?
[146:19.87]Uh, hold on.
[146:21.25]I've got like booby traps.
[146:28.37]The plane is just freaking out up there.
[146:30.41]This plane is freaking me out.
[146:32.95]It's like this scout or something.
[146:43.74]Well, the plane is gone.
[146:45.38]The plane just did a flip.
[146:47.70]Okay, we'll get another one.
[146:48.54]The plane's actually upside down.
[146:50.26]Well done.
[146:50.56]There's a supply drop.
[146:56.51]Whoever is in that plane right now has puked their guts out like five times.
[147:01.43]There's no way you're going to keep doing that.
[147:09.88]Reloading!
[147:13.74]so what is this another outpost or just like I think this is another outpost this is a good this is a person's laser oh okay I thought I don't know I thought that was a friendly it's like a bunker no this is like a little bunker like we probably claim it though
[147:37.04]Do we have to destroy stuff?
[147:37.92]Didn't the thing said destroy things and you'll... I swear to god it was like destroy stuff.
[147:43.54]Why do we both try to mach- machete the like stone statue?
[147:48.46]That's a good question.
[147:52.42]Just break shit.
[147:56.82]This clearly looks like we can take this.
[147:59.00]It does, but I don't think there's anything here.
[148:00.62]Holy... That was a UFO.
[148:07.89]That wasn't even a plane.
[148:08.39]Is that a guided missile?
[148:09.63]Alright.
[148:17.54]Well, I guess we have to go over here.
[148:19.78]Lower it now.
[148:24.76]Oh, lower it.
[148:25.62]No more.
[148:26.02]No more.
[148:26.74]Get up.
[148:31.81]Okay.
[148:32.31]Come on.
[148:32.87]Reloading here.
[148:35.85]I'm pulling like glass out of my body lower your croc lower your crocodile now oh no guapo are we back in the in the like tobacco field I gotta get guapo yeah we're back in the tobacco places
[149:05.50]Come on, Guapo.
[149:06.30]Wait.
[149:06.82]Who are you?
[149:16.93]This person has 500,000 health.
[149:19.65]Okay.
[149:20.83]Maybe a little overkill.
[149:36.47]Okay, I think.
[149:38.49]Guapo's alright?
[149:39.31]Alright, Guapo, you good?
[149:47.84]Where are my other gadgets?
[149:52.64]There's a really weird sound that just came out of your dog.
[149:56.43]Reloading!
[150:00.23]Maybe some like grease in his joints.
[150:02.67]I bet you he gets struck by lightning.
[150:07.00]Oh, another helicopter.
[150:11.01]Person I cannot kill.
[150:12.19]Okay.
[150:15.07]It's like I'm in dress pants doing this stupid mud slide.
[150:20.65]It's like a thousand dollar suit and you're just sliding around.
[150:23.03]He's a father.
[150:30.24]He isn't fucking around.
[150:34.40]Hey, is there like a player three in here?
[150:35.74]Because these guys are all already dead.
[150:38.72]I feel like we did this already.
[150:41.10]Thanks for burning me with your cool jetpack.
[150:44.42]That will never happen, by the way.
[150:45.96]There will never be a jetpack.
[150:48.33]Ever.
[150:49.25]Never going to happen.
[150:50.19]Oh, I get to do boosts.
[150:53.33]And you leave a wake of fire behind you.
[150:54.97]That's hurting us.
[151:02.86]Are we talking about, like, oh, flying cars, jetpacks?
[151:05.96]Nope, nope.
[151:06.60]When you add the other axis, not just left and right, but up and down and forward, you know, you don't understand how insane that would be if they were flying cars.
[151:16.71]I think they called it, like, Titanfall or something.
[151:22.59]People would be able to use the Y and Z axis to pass you on the road, which is in the air.
[151:28.14]Nope.
[151:29.92]There'd be a car, there'd be a flying car accident every, like, there'd be 50,000 flying car accidents every one second.
[151:41.45]If you think that that, like, dick behind you that is just riding your ass while you're going the speed limit on the highway, if you don't think that that guy has a Y and Z axis, he's not gonna fucking crash this first time he drives that car.
[151:51.93]You get twice as many lanes, though.
[151:53.69]Instead of just horizontal, you get vertical lanes.
[151:56.13]So they got more space.
[151:57.53]They got more room.
[151:58.89]And when there's 50,000 cars on the road, think of how many cars are on the highway.
[152:02.88]Yeah, but there's like, are there more people in this timeline?
[152:05.82]Or the same amount of people?
[152:07.24]The same amount of people.
[152:07.90]Just think about when you drive down the road, how many cars you are around.
[152:11.29]Imagine if they could just be anywhere in the sky.
[152:18.55]Listen, to me that sounds like you're stifling progress.
[152:20.93]People said that about cars, too.
[152:22.03]They were like, you know, there's so many horses.
[152:23.55]What if people added, like, cars to this?
[152:25.24]They're going to run over the horses.
[152:27.78]We're all still on the same axis, though.
[152:29.14]You're not adding an axis by having a horse to a car.
[152:33.04]They shared the same plane.
[152:45.53]Skip that.
[152:45.95]Skip it now.
[152:46.63]I don't want to see anymore.
[152:51.76]What?
[152:51.98]You don't like this new Guardians of the Galaxy character?
[153:01.74]James Gunn worked hard on this.
[153:03.32]He got fired, he got rehired, and that's the best he could do under the circumstances with all the mental anguish.
[153:10.72]Oh, here we go.
[153:12.58]Fight!
[153:12.84]Fight!
[153:18.28]Let's go!
[153:27.82]I'm sorry, Guapo.
[153:29.06]Guapo, run!
[153:29.78]I still think that looks like blood.
[153:37.04]It does.
[153:37.44]Alright, I'm gonna do my trick.
[153:42.90]These guys are dead already.
[153:44.24]Yeah, they're all dead.
[153:46.98]Is the game too loud?
[153:47.86]I feel like the game is excruciatingly loud.
[153:50.18]It's louder now, I feel.
[153:51.81]Like, right now.
[153:52.55]Yeah, it definitely got louder.
[153:54.41]Is it the music?
[153:57.03]I can't aim this gun that far.
[154:07.42]Why are they attacking this?
[154:09.92]Yes!
[154:13.36]What?
[154:14.68]Did you see that?
[154:16.30]No, I was too busy spitting gas over there.
[154:17.94]What happened?
[154:18.32]I just traveled like 15 feet for that knife kill.
[154:21.14]Like, floated.
[154:29.33]Take out the soldiers.
[154:30.03]I think there's only one more.
[154:32.35]I think it's still getting louder.
[154:34.23]It definitely is getting louder.
[154:40.01]Where's this last person?
[154:43.95]Oh, here comes a helicopter, of course.
[154:51.74]Helicopter coming in.
[154:52.60]Oh, he's just putting gas out here.
[154:55.30]This guy's taking off.
[154:56.36]He's like, I'm out of here.
[155:13.02]Did you do that?
[155:14.66]Yeah, but why did the car like flip 15 times?
[155:17.68]I don't know.
[155:23.75]Watch out!
[155:27.67]Come on, let me snipe him.
[155:29.73]Come on!
[155:35.07]Is it bulletproof?
[155:36.81]That's what I was thinking earlier.
[155:39.39]I think it is.
[155:42.38]Yeah, this shit's bulletproof.
[155:43.22]I can't hit him from here.
[155:48.29]I'm gonna go to the roof.
[155:55.79]Reloading!
[156:00.24]My jetpack can't go that high.
[156:10.64]Is he gonna land?
[156:15.49]I feel like he's going to land at some point.
[156:16.95]How is he hovering, like, while facing forward the entire time?
[156:21.13]What about the mounted guns?
[156:21.99]Can you aim a mounted gun that high?
[156:35.06]Yes!
[156:38.24]Whoa!
[156:39.86]He had more health than the helicopter.
[156:49.32]Everyone's just lying on the ground.
[156:51.96]Do you have a shield?
[157:05.63]What is this game?
[157:06.63]Okay, this one's actually not fatal.
[157:09.89]It doesn't work.
[157:14.90]I shot right through it.
[157:16.00]It's a piece of cardboard.
[157:17.26]Okay, thanks.
[157:20.79]Hold that shield up.
[157:21.88]I want to see something.
[157:22.52]Hold on.
[157:22.76]Hold on.
[157:28.12]Does it actually work?
[157:29.44]It does.
[157:29.88]It actually works.
[157:31.16]These are the same developers that made Rainbow Six.
[157:34.32]You know all the clips you see on Twitter?
[157:36.87]It's always the shield guy.
[157:38.23]He just walks into a room, holds the shield up for 30 straight seconds.
[157:41.69]Everybody laughs.
[157:43.49]Shot your feet, though.
[157:46.07]Hey, remember when I played Rainbow Six Siege and I thought I was going to like it?
[157:51.03]no that was that might have been like the the game that I would hate the most I remember uh rainbow siege rainbow six siege why are we saying rainbow siege rainbow six siege in alpha had forced open mic lobbies oh yeah that's so bad you're okay so everyone who was streaming it you just go into a lobby it was like alright they've got a guy in the next room yep I'm gonna go ahead and put up my shield hey hey can we get some grenades in there
[158:22.40]It was actually the Ubisoft trailers.
[158:24.67]It really was the Ubisoft trailers.
[158:25.81]People were just talking.
[158:35.78]Yeah, people don't talk when they play co-op games usually.
[158:37.96]I don't want people to hear me unrecorded.
[158:41.77]I've listened, like, back when I used to make YouTube videos, right?
[158:45.43]You'd record a bunch of stuff for, like, hours and hours at a time.
[158:48.61]And I don't know why I do this shit, but I just go like this.
[158:52.12]When no one's in the room and I'm just alone and I'm not even aware of it, I just go like this, like... I just, like, sniff.
[159:01.74]Every, like, two to three minutes, I'll just do, like, a... I don't get it.
[159:06.89]I don't know why.
[159:08.37]It just happens.
[159:10.45]That went pretty good, no?
[159:12.19]I will listen to whole parts of recordings that were, like, 20 minutes of silence and be getting, like, gameplay, and you just hear, like... I feel like now I'm sniffing.
[159:22.79]Right?
[159:23.73]Like, just right now.
[159:24.83]Yeah, you see?
[159:25.99]You just, like, you are now on manual sniffing.
[159:29.86]I don't know what it is.
[159:30.74]Maybe it's, like, breathing in to, like, get a... to stable my breath to shoot at something?
[159:36.28]I don't know.
[159:36.60]It's, like, weird.
[159:38.82]But leave that when I taste it.
[159:40.88]Haven't had anything but filly.
[159:43.22]Yeah, I go in and then it comes out.
[159:48.07]Maybe Otto's in the room.
[159:49.97]No, it's not like an irritation or like, oh, I have allergies or something in the room is bothering me or I have my stuffy nose.
[159:55.51]No, it's just I just make a loud inhale noise every like few minutes.
[160:01.60]Sniffing is kind of like an echolocation for humans.
[160:07.48]It's like, hey, I'm in this room.
[160:09.41]If I was in your chat right now, I would be doing triple question marks in the chat.
[160:16.76]I think, uh, everybody's already used to it.
[160:20.72]It's like, it's not, it's actually not abnormal.
[160:24.76]Echo location.
[160:26.20]Sniffing really loud to, like, here.
[160:28.78]Yeah, so, like, let someone know you're coming.
[160:30.48]So, if you're, like, walking down the hall and you think someone may not know that you're coming, it's like, you know, like, hey, I'm on my way.
[160:38.19]whatever you're doing in here better not be weird better not be weird or embarrassing because here I come that's so funny because like I that's like I have no idea what you're talking about that was it um I I actually he's right yeah true oh that's so funny
[161:01.21]You know what?
[161:01.91]Part of you probably is... That is probably correct.
[161:03.63]Because you hear people kind of like mouth breathing and stuff when they're walking around.
[161:07.43]You'll hear like... Yeah, it's like... So that makes sense, yeah.
[161:18.24]What's going on?
[161:19.54]You're in the west now, Guerrero.
[161:21.96]The sword and the hero.
[161:23.90]It's not coming around.
[161:24.76]Wait, is that a dachshund?
[161:26.20]I just saw a dachshund.
[161:28.12]There is a dachshund in this game.
[161:29.20]What?
[161:31.65]I just saw the doctor.
[161:34.07]We are in third person.
[161:40.30]I'm trying to capitalize on third person.
[161:43.98]This is really weird.
[161:44.82]Okay.
[161:51.34]Build camp facilities.
[161:52.48]Okay.
[161:58.44]just like like follow up for frame rates like worse than third person I really don't think we're supposed to be in third person I made contact with the monteros well carlos wants nothing to do with me but I get along with his daughter I think she's my way in you need to understand them become one of them first step is understanding this camp
[162:21.06]I'm going to have a look around.
[162:22.14]You need to become one of them.
[162:25.92]Yes.
[162:26.92]Sorry, coming in here with my $4,000 suit.
[162:29.00]Try not to get my shoes dirty.
[162:30.28]Could you guys put me in the right direction to overthrow the revolution?
[162:33.20]I want the dachshund pet.
[162:40.77]I feel like this would be a really... You would have an alligator right here next to a dachshund.
[162:45.51]This seems really bad.
[162:48.06]He's got a quest.
[162:49.20]It says, who's a good boy?
[162:51.10]I can't even touch him.
[162:53.28]Billy's furry friend fancies a fantastic feast.
[162:56.12]Look at this perfect little sausage.
[162:57.80]I've got to find him a yummy treat.
[162:59.56]A meal fit for a puppy prince on his special day.
[163:02.88]Reward 100 XP.
[163:03.44]Can you shoot me in the head?
[163:08.83]I'm stuck.
[163:10.43]I don't speak bark, amigo.
[163:13.95]I'm stuck in third person.
[163:15.78]Yeah, I'm stuck in third person too.
[163:17.12]Oh, you still are.
[163:18.22]Because I can't interact with anything.
[163:20.08]Because this is my world.
[163:22.26]You're just passing through.
[163:23.20]No.
[163:23.28]No, but seriously.
[163:24.69]I'm the host.
[163:25.29]Only in the camp.
[163:26.99]Okay.
[163:27.11]I love this little thing.
[163:27.97]The little wheels.
[163:28.63]Okay.
[163:45.90]Alright, I guess we're going to... Build a gorilla camp.
[163:50.06]I think you have to do that.
[163:53.19]Would you rather have access to a wingsuit and hideout locations for fast travel?
[164:01.92]Mm-hmm.
[164:02.89]Or, nah, the other one sucks.
[164:05.12]What is it?
[164:05.46]You can't just say, what if I want that one?
[164:07.52]One's a fishing hut, and we've already tried that.
[164:11.26]Didn't go so well.
[164:12.91]And then visit a cantina and trade animal and fish meat for meals that grant temporary buffs, like in that one Capcom game that everybody likes.
[164:25.66]Yeah, that's cool.
[164:27.68]We'll do the wingsuit one.
[164:29.68]Why would you pick the other one on stream?
[164:31.61]That's like the streamer one.
[164:32.39]You have to pick that one.
[164:43.93]Cool.
[164:45.67]There are lots of big crocs.
[164:47.61]Search for the park.
[164:49.29]West end of Cortina River has a great hunting spot.
[164:54.39]A lot of quests now.
[164:57.31]Yeah.
[164:59.27]We don't even have the main quest.
[165:02.37]Or the side quest.
[165:11.70]Is there mustard here?
[165:12.52]I don't have mustard on my back.
[165:15.87]This is water.
[165:19.80]It's a vacuum cleaner that I've turned into a put it on reverse and put a tube connecting to that into a tank.
[165:24.94]Which then it goes a little thing that goes into my mouth from the top of that and it's water.
[165:28.68]I turn the vacuum on reverse and I can drink it.
[165:31.36]What am I?
[165:33.94]I don't know what is going on.
[165:35.14]I have a leader and recruits.
[165:39.86]And I'm assigning.
[165:40.68]Wait a second.
[165:41.24]Are these passive missions?
[165:42.36]I think I just.
[165:44.16]What did you do?
[165:44.74]I just walked over here and put us in a cutscene.
[165:49.45]I mean, it kind of was.
[165:52.38]Alright, we just don't ever... Any way that we can get right to the fly the plane around is just...
[166:16.80]In the beginning, we talked about like the movie.
[166:18.84]We keep watching the Far Cry movie and leaving in the first act.
[166:21.38]And why do we keep watching the movies?
[166:23.14]It's gotten even worse.
[166:24.72]We are not only leaving in the first act of every Far Cry movie, we are looking up the Wikipedia page of the movie and just reading the spoilers.
[166:32.26]We don't even care.
[166:33.12]This is how, like, IGN always has a walkthrough guide every single time a game launches.
[166:38.91]It's probably just, like, one guy who skips every single cutscene and rushes through the missions to be the first person to have, like, the Google search engine optimization, like, walkthrough page up.
[166:52.60]Ugh.
[166:54.39]You and I are just sitting in the movie theater right now.
[166:55.93]We both have our phones up.
[166:57.73]Ten minutes of the movie has gone by.
[166:59.48]We're both on the Wikipedia page for that movie.
[167:02.24]And we're, like, nudging each other.
[167:03.58]Oh, hey, man.
[167:04.28]Hey, in, like, an hour or two, I guess, like, this main character, like, dies.
[167:08.82]Oh, yeah, that's crazy.
[167:11.82]And then we leave.
[167:12.62]Then there's the reverse.
[167:15.98]The person who doesn't care about any gameplay and just watches the, like, cutscene YouTube compilation.
[167:23.44]Just to skip through the lore.
[167:26.05]Oh, you can do that afterwards.
[167:29.37]You're saying it's super loud, so everyone's hearing you.
[167:37.22]Yeah, we're broadcasting it.
[167:41.28]We are broadcasting us sitting in a... Okay, alright.
[167:47.91]We're broadcasting us sitting in the theater, reading the Wikipedia page really loudly, and we leave after an hour of the movie.
[167:54.14]Hold on.
[167:54.42]I want to see if this works.
[167:55.86]Can you turn around?
[167:57.64]You just stay down there.
[167:58.52]Just look up.
[167:59.46]I want to see if this works.
[168:00.44]It doesn't work.
[168:01.02]The horse is too smart.
[168:02.88]It won't do it.
[168:03.38]Just shoot.
[168:17.69]Looks like a compound over here.
[168:18.81]Oh my god.
[168:30.29]How did I miss that?
[168:31.17]It's impossible.
[168:35.66]I can't do this.
[168:36.44]FOV.
[168:37.80]It is too low.
[168:46.00]Why would you drive a gas truck here?
[168:47.73]Yeah, bring the extremely explosive thing.
[168:52.75]It worked on me, I guess.
[168:54.05]Oh, shit.
[168:54.41]Oh, shit.
[168:54.71]I'm dead.
[168:57.95]3,000 IQ, like, suicide bomb play, I guess.
[169:01.08]They, like, island would be rid of us just sacrificing two people in a gas tank.
[169:04.80]I just want to smoke the cigar.
[169:13.70]Anytime a character in a game smokes a cigar, it doesn't matter what game it is.
[169:18.17]You want one?
[169:19.07]No.
[169:24.49]What I was going to say is I just... It's over.
[169:30.49]I can't even say it.
[169:32.11]Okay, you know what Metal Gear Solid, when you smoke the cigar and you hear the...
[169:43.65]There's a bomb there.
[169:44.61]Who dropped the smoke grenade?
[169:47.84]Where is that?
[170:05.28]Holy shit!
[170:05.84]That was a civilian?
[170:07.76]I mean, that was very, very violent.
[170:09.25]That's some gas.
[170:09.85]Alright, destroy the poison.
[170:36.80]There's a tank.
[170:39.20]What?
[170:40.20]There's a tank.
[170:40.98]Where?
[170:41.64]I need help.
[170:41.93]He knows.
[170:42.53]There's a tank?
[170:43.49]He knows.
[170:44.49]Where's our tank?
[170:48.71]Oh, that's a tank.
[170:51.59]He figured out where the accelerator was.
[170:53.21]Oh, thanks.
[170:58.81]Eat shit, motherfucker!
[170:59.69]Did I get him?
[171:05.11]I don't think so.
[171:10.85]Now you're doing the same thing I was doing.
[171:12.21]Alright, well he's very clearly... Right now he's like, oh fuck, I can't do anything.
[171:17.12]Can you hijack these?
[171:18.42]I don't think so.
[171:18.92]I think this guy... Alright, we're in a stalemate with the tank.
[171:20.88]Yeah.
[171:22.12]If I stand up, will he shoot me in the head?
[171:24.36]Yep.
[171:25.56]Will he shoot me with... I want to get shot with this thing though.
[171:28.68]No, don't... Lame.
[171:29.77]He tried to like burn him.
[171:34.55]That didn't do shit.
[171:35.71]Press V.
[171:41.52]The strategy was not to play.
[171:48.54]I think a tree fell on me.
[171:54.70]He knew.
[171:55.24]He's like, you know what?
[171:57.70]I sit here long enough.
[171:58.54]These two fucking dickheads are going to just die.
[172:02.73]I heard on the radio what they've been doing.
[172:04.39]I'm completely safe here.
[172:11.95]How do you do wingsuit?
[172:13.81]Can you?
[172:16.02]Shift.
[172:17.18]Shift.
[172:20.38]It doesn't do anything.
[172:33.14]That is so stupid.
[172:38.28]That's how you go out?
[172:42.05]We're, like, doing all this really important, we're, like, uh, liberating all these places, we're doing all this stuff, we're, like, and you just hit your head on a wall from the wingsuit, like, why would we even use these?
[172:52.47]What a fucking stupid idea.
[172:54.10]I can't deploy a wingsuit.
[172:56.42]Are you the only one that has it?
[173:00.04]I can't do it.
[173:00.96]I think you're the only one that has it.
[173:11.21]You might be able to pick it up at the camp.
[173:16.59]Oh, they're trying to fly into somebody.
[173:18.57]That's what I'm trying to do.
[173:20.93]If you can fly directly into somebody and just like Superman superhero tackle them.
[173:25.95]I see you, engineer.
[173:35.80]Where'd the people go?
[173:36.58]There's nobody here.
[173:38.46]Aww.
[173:41.09]Alright, yeah, you gotta slide tackle.
[173:43.05]You gotta tackle Lieutenant Alfonso.
[173:48.44]I gotta walk all the way up the hill just to reset the joke.
[173:50.90]This feels like a YouTube video.
[173:52.59]Uh-oh.
[173:55.31]We've been spotted.
[173:55.97]Alright, do it with that information that you need to.
[173:59.97]We've been spotted.
[174:06.29]Dude, aiming it is impossible.
[174:08.55]You freaked that guy out.
[174:10.43]That guy is backing away.
[174:11.37]He's terrified.
[174:13.12]He can't believe what you just did.
[174:14.16]I need them to be standing still.
[174:22.82]Your dog is killing the guy we have to kill.
[174:27.83]He just completed the mission for us.
[174:30.87]Where are you?
[174:34.09]I didn't even see you do that.
[174:36.99]It's good because I missed.
[174:38.55]There's no way.
[174:39.87]They have to be holding perfectly still.
[174:42.71]There's a guy sitting.
[174:45.72]Oh, fuck.
[174:50.52]There's a friendly civilian in there fighting for us.
[174:53.52]What?
[174:54.34]Yeah, the guy with the blue dot.
[174:57.37]Well, he's dead now.
[175:02.93]What did you just throw?
[175:08.37]Alright, I need stuff like watching the video and play the actual game here.
[175:16.87]We did it.
[175:17.86]I think.
[175:20.76]Maybe not.
[175:31.21]Probably with like one of these mounted guns.
[175:33.67]Sometimes he's fast.
[175:34.61]He actually is trying to run you over.
[175:37.52]Where is he?
[175:39.02]I'm distracting him.
[175:40.96]I'm in smoke right now.
[175:42.06]I can't see anything.
[175:44.89]I need some backup.
[175:56.94]Is it working?
[175:57.98]No.
[176:06.88]hey hey luckily he forgot he has a forward mounted like explosive is there are there motors somewhere over here if I feel like there has to be I think we're supposed to hang on hang on can we just like hot swap the backpack to rockets can you hot like just swap it out
[176:37.64]I have to make him dizzy.
[176:40.61]Fucker, what are you talking about?
[176:46.03]Get away from me.
[176:47.45]How'd you do that?
[176:54.12]I just changed back to rocket pack.
[176:57.50]Oh, okay.
[177:00.30]My jet pack wasn't doing anything.
[177:02.97]Your dog needs help.
[177:04.88]Okay.
[177:07.11]He's fine.
[177:09.39]He's good.
[177:09.77]That guy.
[177:13.27]Whatever.
[177:20.85]Yeah.
[177:21.05]Don't shoot the horses.
[177:22.33]Don't shoot the horses.
[177:27.45]Why do they just keep walking down this hill?
[177:29.31]I think the alarm raised.
[177:34.48]The horses bark?
[177:35.84]They've got horses, mobility, long-range guns.
[177:40.30]This is like in John Wick.
[177:42.34]When all of the enemies, the bad guys, for some reason, enter, like, gun-fu range.
[177:47.41]So that he can disarm them and, like, throw them to the ground.
[177:49.51]Okay, and you forgot about the music that plays.
[177:53.59]That, like... Alright, we gotta move.
[178:17.08]Carlos, it's Danny.
[178:19.10]We have to destroy the poison containers.
[178:21.34]That's the mission we're on right now.
[178:26.38]Oops.
[178:27.16]Oh, my God.
[178:27.68]Such an opportunity.
[178:28.56]Such an opportunity.
[178:30.37]Such an opportunity.
[178:31.19]There's a guy terror dropping in.
[178:33.97]Do you see the guy?
[178:35.23]Oh, you're shooting it.
[178:35.87]I've sniped him like five times.
[178:37.83]What the fuck?
[178:39.79]That guy can't be alive.
[178:45.42]Why do they always get the fun helicopters?
[178:46.81]Why is my dog on fire?
[178:56.81]War crime, Andy?
[178:58.01]What?
[178:58.25]What are you talking about?
[178:58.97]Hey, I'm dying.
[178:59.81]Help me.
[179:01.11]What?
[179:03.55]Me too.
[179:04.57]Oh.
[179:06.57]The helicopter did it.
[179:15.06]because you were shooting the guy parachuting.
[179:17.00]Oh.
[179:17.56]Oh, shit.
[179:22.65]Oh, shit.
[179:23.35]Okay.
[179:23.93]Right.
[179:24.27]You know what?
[179:24.79]If they didn't want to get shot, then they should have paradropped somewhere else.
[179:28.69]Poor crime.
[179:30.31]Well, they're poisoning people.
[179:32.79]I have no defense.
[179:35.05]I have no defense.
[179:41.96]Why are we here?
[179:42.84]I don't know.
[179:43.68]They put us all the way back here.
[179:46.07]Were we just at one of the two objectives?
[179:51.25]Yeah, but we died.
[179:55.46]Let's take a look at the map for a second, because I feel like we're just running around like morons.
[180:00.24]Clear the air.
[180:02.94]So, now we have to poison his troops.
[180:06.22]No, wait.
[180:06.62]Now he's poisoning his troops.
[180:08.64]He's killing us.
[180:09.96]Yeah, crop dusters.
[180:11.38]Yellow tankers, fumigators.
[180:12.56]That's what we're doing.
[180:14.25]If we take out the anti-air gun, then we can fly.
[180:17.87]Which is... here.
[180:19.95]Right next to the, uh... I got an idea.
[180:26.21]Which one do you want to do first?
[180:31.33]My idea is driving away.
[180:35.27]Wait, coming back.
[180:36.19]Is this one of the poison trucks?
[180:47.45]Holy shit!
[180:52.25]Oh my god!
[180:53.23]Okay, well we got it.
[180:57.97]Is this what you wanted?
[180:58.71]Yeah.
[180:59.51]Are you in the car?
[181:02.91]No, I'm coming.
[181:07.25]Alright, so what was your plan?
[181:08.61]We have like, I don't know, to like put C4 on this and just like drive it into the middle of the thing and then go full speed and dive out and blow it up.
[181:18.39]Do we have C4?
[181:19.19]Not really, but I mean, if we could just shoot it fast enough afterward, it would be fine.
[181:27.25]Couldn't we also just shoot the car and it would explode and do the same thing?
[181:31.50]That's what I just said, yeah.
[181:32.84]Yeah, but forget about the C4.
[181:34.02]Yeah, that's what I said.
[181:35.94]Oh, you just said that?
[181:36.68]You said, do we have C4?
[181:37.84]And I just said, yeah, we could just dive out and if we can shoot the car fast enough, then it'll explode.
[181:42.32]And you said, what if we just shoot the car and skip the C4?
[181:45.96]Like it was your own idea.
[181:47.50]No, I was corroborating your idea because I thought you said that we could get C4 and shoot the C4.
[181:55.92]Jerma never listens to the plan.
[181:57.14]Yeah, that's why they call me the wild card.
[182:01.05]Because I do crazy stuff like this.
[182:06.25]In my friend group, I'm the wild one.
[182:11.86]It won't... It won't blow...
[182:20.20]What did you do?
[182:21.84]I'm dead, somehow.
[182:22.76]Are you dead?
[182:23.46]Oh, fuck.
[182:32.79]Come on.
[182:35.58]Hey, thanks.
[182:38.32]Oh, that's a Spillan.
[182:40.32]Hey.
[182:48.06]The plane is here.
[182:49.16]Oh, we have to take out those crop duster thingies.
[182:59.20]We have to take out the crop duster thingies.
[183:01.32]Up there.
[183:01.60]How did that miss?
[183:13.20]How are we supposed to actually get rid of that?
[183:17.48]We need our own helicopter.
[183:25.99]This guy just has such an advantage.
[183:29.89]Alright, do you have rockets or something?
[183:35.58]I don't have any rockets or anything, no.
[183:38.42]We just have to... Shoot the pilot?
[183:44.11]You make that sound like that's a simple thing to do.
[183:47.42]I have this thing.
[183:49.26]Damn it.
[183:59.07]Going up top.
[184:07.99]I just popped an entire bottle of pills.
[184:16.88]What happened?
[184:18.64]Did he crash into me?
[184:20.59]Did the plane crash into me?
[184:22.65]Yeah, because I shot the pilot.
[184:24.81]Wait, did you get a good view of that?
[184:26.41]Yeah.
[184:27.69]Oh, I hope so, because I want to see that later.
[184:31.67]What the fuck?
[184:32.95]I'm coming.
[184:36.66]I'm coming.
[184:37.16]Oh, my God.

[185:18.74]This is the opportunity.
[185:19.78]We're going to sit here all day until you do this.
[185:21.68]I don't care how long it takes.
[185:23.03]It wouldn't go any further.
[185:25.11]I don't care how long it takes.
[185:26.09]This wingsuit sucks.
[185:28.13]You get back up here this instant and we do this.
[185:30.87]Did you get her?
[185:39.24]I had to.
[185:42.46]No.
[185:42.80]Because my body is right next to her.
[185:46.16]How did that not hit?
[185:47.36]I guess it didn't hit.
[185:55.30]She's deceptively, like... You gotta, like, drop.
[185:59.21]Alright, this is the one.
[186:01.03]My training will be complete.
[186:02.81]Oh, she's moving.
[186:16.43]That was it.
[186:17.43]That was it.
[186:18.13]You got her.
[186:20.71]She got like pushed back.
[186:22.80]Like 15 feet.
[186:26.50]And she's still alive.
[186:27.30]She's still alive, yeah.
[186:28.38]She killed me.
[186:30.20]She killed you?
[186:32.58]That's so stupid.
[186:39.17]Is she still just there?
[186:40.03]Did I just hear missiles?
[186:43.61]I just heard missiles fire.
[186:48.93]What are you firing over here?
[186:51.89]Oh, hi.
[186:55.21]Yeah, don't do that to my camera.
[186:58.45]I think you hurt her leg.
[186:59.53]She's holding her leg.
[187:02.28]I'm just watching because it looks like you hurt her leg.
[187:04.84]Her leg is hurt.
[187:11.66]What are you doing?
[187:14.79]Somebody said, everything is funnier when it's far away.
[187:17.91]You know what?
[187:18.35]That's actually true.
[187:19.31]I think you're missing.
[187:33.40]You just... On core challenge, you just did an achievement.
[187:37.30]Okay.
[187:37.74]That was just... Okay.
[187:41.92]What?
[187:43.34]What?
[187:47.20]You want to deal with the hazmat suit guy?
[187:49.04]Did you just go for a... You just went to kick the guy?
[187:53.52]You just went to do a huge kick on that guy.
[187:56.08]It looks like you kicked him.
[187:57.26]K9000 already won.
[187:59.27]Okay, that was fun.
[188:00.39]That was fun.
[188:01.71]Man, that was actually pretty fun.
[188:04.47]Okay, now... If you say it enough times, it'll be true.
[188:06.27]Wait, here's the POV of the plane.
[188:12.01]I need to see this.
[188:15.93]Hold on, we have to watch this.
[188:17.49]We have to watch Etalyx' POV for a second.
[188:23.00]Hold on.
[188:27.34]This is really important.
[188:32.50]Okay, let's take a look.
[188:36.05]This is your POV.
[188:38.03]Yes.
[188:45.53]Alright, that was awesome.
[188:48.31]Honestly, without you shooting it, it looked like he was going to just drive into it.
[188:52.54]It was going to be pretty close, yeah.
[188:54.14]It may have actually rammed into you, possibly.
[188:56.76]You just made sure it was going to happen.
[188:59.16]Okay, that was actually awesome.
[189:00.67]Alright, back to it.
[189:03.11]What were we doing?
[189:04.87]Uh, new gun?
[189:05.27]Did you get that gun?
[189:06.07]I did.
[189:06.31]Or do you have to loot everything that I loot?
[189:10.29]I think you... No, I got the gun.
[189:24.64]Is it poison inside search zone?
[189:26.94]There's still shit to do.
[189:27.95]What the hell?
[189:28.55]I was just giving you a moment to regroup.
[189:31.81]Okay.
[189:33.25]Let's go.
[189:33.91]We just need to get rid of the poison containers and shit.
[189:40.10]Okay.
[189:41.54]Well, this looks like poison container over here.
[189:51.37]This looks pretty poisonous, doesn't it?
[189:53.24]Yeah, you're kind of just walking in the poison.
[189:56.04]What's the origin of it?
[189:56.80]There's a guy in the watchtower.
[190:00.18]Come hide from me.
[190:01.62]He's climbing down to come to us.
[190:06.11]I see you!
[190:07.55]And it was the last thing he ever saw.
[190:12.97]He ever saw.
[190:13.58]I fucked it up.
[190:14.64]What a bad one-liner.
[190:22.34]Okay.
[190:23.00]So.
[190:23.78]It's just everywhere over here.
[190:24.90]That is so goddamn loud.
[190:27.84]Alright.
[190:36.46]Here.
[190:36.70]Poison barrels.
[190:37.56]Okay.
[190:37.84]Destroy them.
[190:38.56]Yep.
[190:39.55]There they are.
[190:40.05]Wait.
[190:42.31]Oh.
[190:42.47]Danger close.
[190:45.13]Alright.
[190:45.33]That one's gone.
[190:50.71]I think we have to move.
[190:51.98]I can Captain America these people.
[190:55.38]Yeah, you have a bunch of cool power moves.
[190:58.14]This is not the premium gun.
[190:59.56]This is just the one that I picked.
[191:00.66]Did you equip the guns you picked from the last thing we did?
[191:05.19]Yeah, I have the crossbow thing.
[191:06.51]You can get in?
[191:07.29]Wait, is there another guy?
[191:10.27]Hang on, my dog's in the front seat.
[191:20.39]He is in the front seat.
[191:21.07]Yeah.
[191:22.67]I'm up top.
[191:27.73]Jesus.
[191:31.66]This is motion sickness.
[191:33.84]That's just bad.
[191:35.54]What are we supposed to blow up?
[191:37.74]We got 49%.
[191:38.51]Yeah, because the two gold indicators are where we have to go.
[191:43.67]Wait, are you sure it's not more here?
[191:46.25]No, I don't think so.
[191:47.45]I think we got them all here.
[191:48.71]Okay.
[191:49.37]See, it's like, oh, poisoning.
[191:50.31]It's just weird to have a quest that's like the next objective is 800 meters away.
[191:53.66]Yeah.
[191:55.94]I'm pretty sure they're just spread out along all these indicators.
[192:08.48]He's bad at piloting every vehicle.
[192:10.16]I'm not driving this one.
[192:13.89]Kill these guys.
[192:14.37]He's got something in his truck.
[192:29.31]Okay, try to kill the... Alright, I'll try to kill the driver.
[192:39.49]He stepped out of the vehicle.
[192:40.73]Alright, let's get it.
[192:46.04]What the?
[192:48.30]I thought, whoa, there's people.
[192:49.38]There's people.
[192:53.06]Ow, help.
[192:56.06]Thank you.
[193:00.78]Yeah, I thought there are people.
[193:02.12]That's why you were in the gunner's seat.
[193:03.37]Alright, what'd we get?
[193:06.89]Something in here?
[193:07.35]Something in here, interact.
[193:11.69]Ooh, we got metal.
[193:13.07]Oh, I thought it was going to be like... I thought they were carrying like another vehicle.
[193:18.25]Not crafting materials.
[193:20.29]That's bad.
[193:20.62]That's a bad guy.
[193:21.94]Oh, shit.
[193:32.76]Okay.
[193:33.48]New car.
[193:34.34]New plan.

[193:45.96]Alright, get us somewhere and get us somewhere quick.
[193:50.83]Okay, I'll go as fast as I can.
[193:52.45]Drive fast and get us there.
[194:04.56]Not from my perspective.
[194:06.06]Not from my perspective.

[195:56.31]Did they take out the Far Cry 5 trucks that have the back doors that open for some reason?
[196:06.30]You drive.
[196:06.90]I can't be held responsible.
[196:10.57]I tried driving last time.
[196:12.11]It didn't work out so well for me.
[196:24.81]Oh, he's got a hazmat suit on.
[196:26.05]Shit.

[196:39.30]What happened?
[196:40.96]What happened?
[196:43.82]Huh?
[196:44.66]So I guess the guy in front of the car, I was trying to just drive forward.
[196:49.44]I ran over him and he exploded and like caught the engine block on fire.
[196:54.83]Oh, okay.
[196:55.73]And exploded.
[196:56.47]Alright, I'm tired of watching my companion get destroyed.

[198:54.53]There's so many distractions.
[198:59.72]Okay.
[199:00.74]I think I know what I need to do.
[199:01.96]Oh, God.
[199:02.40]This guy's behind us now.
[199:03.58]Wait, which way?
[199:05.38]We have to go to the gold.

[199:23.41]No, it's like a different one.
[199:25.67]Oh.
[199:28.01]Hold on.
[199:31.87]This front thing on the car is supposed to do something that has potential.
[199:39.03]Okay.
[199:39.57]We're going back to where we just came from.
[199:41.35]Yeah, I'm just looking for a car.
[199:42.91]Woppo!
[199:43.43]Woppo!
[199:44.04]What the?
[199:46.64]He's fine.
[199:49.36]Whatever, we'll put a pin on this.
[200:02.45]Oh my goodness.
[200:07.90]Alright, we're fine.
[200:17.00]Look out.
[200:17.88]Oh no.
[200:18.48]Oh no.
[200:20.71]I gotta turn this fucking game down, man.
[200:27.25]Alright, you drive.
[200:32.02]I'm gonna turn the game down.
[200:34.76]This shit's just so loud.
[200:40.86]I'm gonna hear this game in my fucking dreams.
[200:48.71]Um... I... Well, we made it.
[200:52.75]I guess we made it.
[200:54.35]Did you do it?
[200:56.75]Alright, I gotta get out.
[201:03.70]You're gonna make me fucking puke.
[201:05.10]I gotta get out of here.
[201:11.41]Oh, the guy on the left.
[201:15.63]Why am I... Oh, that was embarrassing.
[201:18.65]That was really embarrassing.
[201:20.69]Alright, I abandoned you.
[201:25.17]You're on your own.
[201:26.07]I'm dead.
[201:27.09]Oh, you're dead.
[201:28.47]I have one HP.
[201:29.58]I unloaded a clip into this guy's chest and he just super kicked me and killed me.
[201:43.91]Are you going to have to revive me?
[201:46.25]Wait.
[201:47.85]I was picking you up.
[201:50.55]I was in animation picking you up.
[201:52.51]How are you still down?
[201:53.39]I guess he must have shot me the second that I came up.
[202:00.68]How come Guapa doesn't have one of those things that those dogs have?
[202:03.54]The rescue dogs with little things around their neck?
[202:05.72]From the old cartoons and stuff?
[202:09.01]What?
[202:10.50]You remember like that, like the dogs, the big with the collar, they had like water in it and stuff?
[202:17.07]Had water in it?
[202:18.47]Yeah.
[202:21.01]You mean a flask?
[202:22.21]A cask?
[202:22.85]Yeah.
[202:26.65]It was booze?
[202:28.07]It was brandy, it wasn't water.
[202:29.88]What?!
[202:36.48]It was alcohol?! !
[202:40.37]It was booze to warm you up.
[202:43.65]Why was it not water?
[202:45.04]Where are you going, by the way?
[202:49.80]Put a fucking Gatorade in that thing!
[202:51.44]Alright.
[202:51.70]I'll go this way.
[202:55.42]Water would freeze.
[202:56.78]Oh.
[202:57.56]That's right.
[203:01.22]So what are you even talking about?
[203:03.26]Okay.
[203:04.36]I remember watching old TV shows and movies where there's a huge St.
[203:07.56]Bernard and it had this thing around its neck.
[203:09.38]And it was with a big group of adventurers.
[203:13.30]And they would drink out of the canteen around the dog's neck.
[203:22.61]It was in Beethoven.
[203:23.91]No, it wasn't in Beethoven.
[203:29.81]Oh, are you already in there?
[203:31.53]It was from Looney Tunes.
[203:32.65]I don't know.
[203:33.07]It was from some cartoon or some movie.
[203:37.01]Oh, my God.
[203:37.51]I'm down again.
[203:38.15]I'm so bad at this game.
[203:41.30]I'm on my way.
[203:45.14]It was booze to make you feel warmer.
[203:46.52]Yeah, well, you know what I'm saying.
[203:53.61]Pirates of the Caribbean.
[203:55.61]Yeah, it was like a flask.
[203:57.89]Oh, shit.
[203:58.25]Sorry, I punched you.
[204:02.15]It wasn't big.
[204:02.71]It was pretty small.
[204:03.41]Yeah, it was alcohol.
[204:05.95]Shit.
[204:06.15]You're right.
[204:06.47]Never mind.
[204:11.93]There's another helicopter.
[204:13.26]I feel like... Okay, we're doing this so wrong, man.
[204:17.46]I don't even know what we're... Okay.
[204:19.04]We can't just like... First of all... We're running into... Second of all...
[204:27.59]Although in legend, a cask of liquor around a dog collar to warm up travelers, no historical records exist of this practice.
[204:35.75]So did like the Looney Tunes just make this shit up?
[204:38.71]Why do I have that thing?
[204:39.83]Why am I thinking that?
[204:42.89]Dude, you keep bringing me up and I keep dying instantly.
[204:47.39]It was milk.
[204:56.18]Am I hitting this guy?
[205:00.43]Alright, where are you?
[205:01.91]Just forget about me.
[205:03.75]I will die if I have to.
[205:05.09]There's a helicopter flying dangerously low to the ground, by the way.
[205:11.20]Right above you.
[205:14.98]You have like a sword and shield.
[205:16.85]You look like such an idiot.
[205:19.05]Dude, I'm trying to level my paladin.
[205:23.31]Okay.
[205:23.43]Okay.
[205:27.93]Guapo.
[205:29.07]Wait, that's not Guapo.
[205:30.39]Still equally as important.
[205:31.41]Get up.
[205:40.27]I'm doing like the E3 trailer right now.
[205:43.43]Holy shit.
[205:47.45]Okay, I was.
[205:48.55]You alright?
[205:48.89]Okay, I'm coming.
[205:53.33]What's aiming at me?
[205:54.39]Why is that aiming at me?
[205:55.85]What the fuck is that thing?
[205:56.85]Why isn't there some...
[206:01.45]Really?
[206:02.33]There's robotic controllers?
[206:05.39]What?
[206:06.15]There's like two guys left.
[206:10.09]There's a turret there?
[206:11.33]Okay.
[206:22.11]We're not supposed to be doing it like that.
[206:27.13]We have to be tactical.
[206:28.09]I mean, but we have to blow them up.
[206:29.55]So they gotta... You can't do this in stealth, right?
[206:33.23]Okay.
[206:33.67]He sent us a photo.
[206:37.94]Okay.
[206:40.10]I'm just gonna snipe.
[206:44.44]Okay.
[206:44.72]You snipe.
[206:45.56]I'll go in.
[206:56.71]I sniped him in your hands.
[207:01.85]Oh, he got the alarm off.
[207:08.79]Shoot the alarm.
[207:11.42]Dude, they come instantly.
[207:13.04]They're already here.
[207:15.68]What the fuck?
[207:17.50]You can't disable the alarm after... These guys...
[207:25.05]I'm sorry, dog.
[207:26.03]Attack dog.
[207:26.51]There are attack dogs.
[207:28.59]I don't even know where the enemies are.
[207:32.15]Oh, shit.
[207:34.21]Alright, come on, Guapo.
[207:36.64]Let's go.
[207:36.82]I think we're okay.
[207:42.48]We're good.
[207:42.74]Alright.
[207:43.52]We're good.
[207:43.80]We're good.
[207:44.14]We're good.
[207:44.48]We're just going to kill them.
[207:45.98]Destroy all the stuff.
[207:49.54]Are you dead?
[207:50.70]No, I'm good.
[207:51.64]That person's body evaporated.
[207:54.10]Also, I need to blow up the barrels right next to you.
[207:55.95]Yeah, let me run another way.
[208:00.75]Force back.
[208:05.77]I think that's it.
[208:07.79]That looks like it's it.
[208:08.54]Nope, there's one more.
[208:16.20]Wait a minute.
[208:16.60]What's in...
[208:18.63]Okay, we got this dog.
[208:24.21]Let's dog out.
[208:24.79]Let's dog out.
[208:28.85]My pet is down.
[208:35.14]I hear loud sounds.
[208:39.32]Oh.
[208:43.12]I think we cleared it, though.
[208:49.19]Yeah, I think we're good.
[208:49.73]I think we can move on to the next one.
[208:51.61]Jesus.
[208:52.09]Yeah, we gotta get out of here.
[209:02.60]Come.
[209:03.36]Come to me.
[209:07.24]Uh-oh.
[209:08.64]Why would you ever pick the passenger seat, is what I'm wondering.
[209:12.08]Why would you ever do that?
[209:13.68]You alright?
[209:16.86]Oh, no.
[209:18.46]Oh, no.
[209:19.04]He's turning it to me.
[209:20.04]Where am I?
[209:26.22]Oh, you missed.
[209:28.68]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[209:30.84]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[209:36.51]Yeah.
[209:38.27]Alright.
[209:38.49]Where's the last one?
[209:39.05]Yes.
[209:39.15]That 400 meters to your right.
[209:54.24]I can't drive through that.
[209:55.38]I thought I could.
[209:55.80]It's made of stone.
[209:56.70]I know, but whatever.
[210:01.60]We're trespassing.
[210:08.29]Okay.
[210:17.57]The turret sinking in this game is better than the Battlefield 2042 Alpha.
[210:20.28]Mm-hmm.
[210:24.23]It's pretty clean.
[210:27.81]Okay.
[210:28.21]How about we just stay out?
[210:30.21]And just from a distance.
[210:32.22]Right?
[210:32.42]Why do we have to go in?
[210:33.20]We don't have to go inside.
[210:35.30]We're just surrounding ourselves with people.
[210:54.17]Alright, I'm going in.
[210:57.49]Why is there fire over here?
[210:58.39]They just called for backup.
[211:01.51]Jesus, who is shooting me?
[211:03.09]It's... God damn it!
[211:06.87]I couldn't even... I didn't see that guy.
[211:14.84]If I bleed out and you're alive, I'll just spawn right next to you, right?
[211:17.00]Oh, wait.
[211:17.38]Are you... Hang on.
[211:18.04]Are you dead?
[211:18.88]Yeah, but I think I'll just spawn right next to you.
[211:21.34]Bet.
[211:22.70]I'm going to die.
[211:23.80]You better bleed fast.
[211:31.52]Have you tried playing with your monitor turned on?
[211:34.42]Oh, shit.
[211:34.88]Hold on.
[211:35.92]What the fuck?
[211:36.40]That's right.
[211:38.28]I was wondering why I was just sitting here.
[211:39.57]It was just a glare.
[211:40.51]Look at my face.
[211:41.05]Look like a mirror.
[211:42.83]Hang on.
[211:43.31]Are you still on the contrast screen?
[211:46.31]No, no.
[211:46.59]I just didn't have the monitor on.
[211:48.27]I was wondering.
[211:48.69]I was like, this looks like me sitting here.
[211:51.29]Yeah, you have to turn the brightness up enough where you can just barely see the line.
[212:04.38]I heard the sounds and stuff, but I didn't know where they were coming from.
[212:08.54]Alright, where are we at?
[212:15.11]How have we still not done this?
[212:17.69]Because we just died.
[212:19.61]We're still on this mission, right?
[212:20.69]94%.
[212:21.23]We just have to destroy more tobacco things.
[212:24.78]Really?
[212:34.39]Come on. 99%.
[212:48.00]He's telling us to shoot the planes, but what he's not telling us is how, what, we need better weapons.
[212:55.11]We can't just shoot at the planes.
[212:56.07]We did that already.
[212:56.73]It didn't do anything.
[212:58.21]Alright, just look for a yellow barrel and shoot it.
[213:05.36]Just shoot harder.
[213:06.02]Make sure you craft the right bullets.
[213:12.12]You need armor-piercing rounds for those planes.
[213:15.16]This guy's fishing.
[213:16.40]Shoot him again.
[213:20.68]Okay, I killed that guy and we did it.
[213:22.10]Mission complete.
[213:34.63]Did you do it?
[213:35.63]Yeah, apparently.
[213:36.61]Someone in your chat just said, is this game co-op?
[213:49.92]um yes we're just we're both playing single player at the same time we just like talking to each other this guy's trying to come I'm just literally waiting in the car for you recipe I'm gonna try and make it for him I didn't do anything and these guys are attacking me for me to drive yeah
[214:20.51]Yeah, we just went to, like, the convenience store and I, like, didn't feel like getting out of the car, so I was on my phone.
[214:24.35]Oh my god.
[214:37.28]Sorry, I bumped you.
[214:40.30]Wait, what?
[214:42.05]I just, like, I punched, like, the mic.
[214:44.87]Sorry, I punched the mic.
[214:45.73]Oh, I thought you meant you bumped the car.
[214:49.05]And that's why we exploded.
[214:50.09]Alright, well, we have a main mission over here.
[214:54.87]I want to go to, like, the workbench and look at stuff.
[214:57.29]Right?
[214:57.71]I don't want to just shoot the same bullets.
[214:59.09]I do, yeah.
[215:00.29]Okay.
[215:00.97]Yeah.
[215:01.23]Maybe you should pay premium.
[215:02.89]You could have all the guns I have to play with.
[215:04.87]I'm not going to do that.
[215:12.22]We can't... Why did they put us here?
[215:14.86]Why did you put us in a trespassing area?
[215:18.38]It spawned us in the trespass.
[215:29.33]You're a Diablo II character.
[215:38.20]Alright, whatever.
[215:41.12]I don't think you can get on this.
[215:43.35]Sure, I can.
[215:44.13]You can?
[215:51.60]You are on it.
[215:52.78]Yeah.
[215:55.20]I'm here.
[215:55.58]The back of your head is right in front of my barrel.
[215:59.96]Yeah.
[216:02.61]Psycho!
[216:05.99]It took me two- Psycho!
[216:07.81]We're going the wrong way!
[216:17.23]That one lived.
[216:17.85]You're a menace.
[216:20.62]I'm just practicing.
[216:21.54]I love how you said cover me.
[216:24.32]I'm reloading.
[216:25.00]Alright, this is a bad guy right here.
[216:28.06]Not those.
[216:28.46]This one.
[216:28.84]Got him.
[216:31.14]You didn't hit a single... You're just going to leave him?
[216:34.35]I mean... This is chaos.
[216:40.57]Okay.
[216:41.09]We didn't even aggro those guys.
[216:43.15]No.
[216:43.23]They're just driving by shooting at us.
[216:49.02]This is the part of the fucking comedy movie where I go, hold on to your seats.
[216:54.40]And you close your eyes.
[216:55.36]You cover both eyes with both hands.
[216:56.66]And you go, oh, no.
[216:59.75]You're going to have to go faster.
[217:03.79]To really build up the drama.
[217:15.54]Oh.
[217:20.00]that go differently in your head?
[217:24.56]Yeah.
[217:33.63]Are you drowning?
[217:35.89]Wait, your head just went up all above the water.
[217:37.69]That's not fair.
[217:38.37]Hold on, you get air?
[217:41.56]You get air?
[217:46.96]I'm gonna live.
[217:48.10]That's not fair.
[217:49.76]That's unfair.
[217:56.24]The best laid jokes.
[218:03.38]Why am I?
[218:03.86]I'm sinking further than I think I should be.
[218:06.78]This is this deep?
[218:10.36]How deep is this?
[218:11.11]This is deep fucking water.
[218:12.53]What's going on?
[218:14.35]Let that be a lesson, kids, okay?
[218:16.31]Don't try and cross real rivers just because it looks shallow.
[218:19.71]This river is like 700 feet deep.
[218:23.03]That's how they died on the Oregon Trail and... What the fuck?
[218:26.33]In the Crusades.
[218:31.24]Where are you?
[218:32.62]I am 5,000 feet underneath this water.
[218:35.04]Okay, that... Actually, you were right.
[218:38.20]Let that be a lesson.
[218:40.32]You are... You just got watchdogged.
[218:43.56]I think that's what happened.
[218:48.29]How deep is this, actually?
[218:50.07]Okay, so you were under the map.
[218:51.75]Yeah, okay, this is literally, like, five, six feet deep.
[218:54.27]Not even, like, four feet deep.
[218:56.24]That was really weird.
[218:57.02]Unless there's this one, like, giant sinkhole thing.
[219:01.56]I think, I think what happened was, I was still on the back of the buggy, and you spawned on me, but since I was, like, facing up, behind me was, like, under the soil.
[219:11.98]Ah, I see.
[219:21.21]Oh, this is nice.
[219:23.33]Don't you dare.
[219:24.51]I'll be very mad at you if you shoot that thing.
[219:27.91]Okay.
[219:28.86]No, not that.
[219:31.02]No, the goat.
[219:33.62]Don't kill it.
[219:34.16]Don't kill it.
[219:41.74]I don't even see a goat.
[219:43.59]It ran by us and it was cute.
[219:45.99]It's not going to leave us alone.
[219:49.05]Leave us alone.
[219:51.47]What?
[219:56.33]Where's Guapo?
[220:00.59]Oh shit!
[220:01.53]Oh no!
[220:02.55]Guapo!
[220:02.95]Guapo, get him!
[220:04.31]What are you doing?
[220:06.70]Oh my god!
[220:16.50]Oh.
[220:17.76]Oh my- Okay, this is like fucking brutal.
[220:19.56]I don't like this.
[220:20.20]I don't like this.
[220:21.04]I don't like this anymore.
[220:22.28]I don't like this anymore.
[220:25.08]I don't like this anymore.
[220:27.42]They killed my cat.
[220:31.65]Holy shit.
[220:39.15]Oh, dude, we got some coyote meat.
[220:40.37]We could probably trade that for a new rocket launcher.
[220:45.59]That was a death roll?
[220:46.67]Yeah, that was brutal.
[220:58.28]There are people?
[221:00.20]Out here?
[221:01.22]Yeah.
[221:02.32]That was a road.
[221:07.04]These... These guys are in, like, different... What happened?
[221:12.31]It's like...
[221:16.30]Okay.
[221:17.06]What happened?
[221:18.64]What happened?
[221:22.79]I swear to God, every time a lady comes over with an ATV, the screen explodes.
[221:26.79]I don't know.
[221:27.69]What's happening here?
[221:28.41]It's better if you don't know.
[221:34.08]We actually need a vehicle.
[221:35.10]We need something.
[221:46.64]I don't... Who... Is that you?
[221:49.80]I thought that was you.
[221:53.65]Who is he?
[221:54.23]What are you eating?
[221:55.75]Drop it.
[221:56.59]Drop that.
[221:57.21]Drop it.
[221:58.87]Ah, don't do that.
[221:59.99]Drop it.
[222:00.47]Okay, I think we're okay now.
[222:15.58]No, no, no, no.
[222:16.88]No more ATV people.
[222:18.18]No more people on ATVs.
[222:19.92]They cause problems.
[222:21.16]He just rammed at the back of my car and started honking.
[222:29.23]Why is he sprinting after?
[222:33.03]Yeah, keep going.
[222:36.63]We gotta follow this.
[222:39.04]This is like a... We gotta have the camera out for this.
[222:42.90]I just saw blood.
[222:43.66]I don't know whose it was.
[222:48.60]What is this lady's problem?
[222:53.08]Yarin traffic, am I right?
[222:54.68]Oh, here comes another ATV!
[222:59.87]Okay.
[223:00.05]Eventually.
[223:00.43]Is that blood or mud?
[223:01.27]I don't know.
[223:19.63]What?
[223:20.47]What are you looking at?
[223:21.51]The horse.
[223:25.41]Oh, God!
[223:32.44]I don't know where to point my camera.
[223:34.50]She's still going.
[223:38.14]There she is!
[223:46.69]Her car is smoking.
[223:55.39]I'm trying to protect her.
[223:56.33]Channel 7 News.
[223:57.73]Making sure she's OK.
[224:11.77]He's alright.
[224:15.40]Did a plane just crash?
[224:27.24]I'm feeling like I'm holding down the cinematic button in GTA.
[224:30.66]Why do you keep crashing into shit?
[224:35.53]No, we're gonna lose her!
[224:36.37]I just got shot in the head!
[224:42.23]Why is it pulling me off the road?
[224:44.55]Oh my god!
[224:45.65]We are the worst at trailing somebody!
[224:48.24]That's how every Assassin's Creed trailing mission ends.
[224:54.86]They've got it down to a science.
[225:05.73]Okay.
[225:09.12]Going well.
[225:15.50]Is this dash cam footage?
[225:17.88]Imagine bringing this to, like, court.
[225:20.57]The amount of insane shit going on.
[225:22.65]The judge would just put his hands up and be like, I don't even- I don't know what the fuck is happening in your dash cam.
[225:28.80]It was 56 car accidents in 15 seconds.
[225:32.44]Who's at fault?
[225:33.34]Did you have to ride away?
[225:34.34]I have no idea.
[225:35.12]You're all just going to jail, I guess.
[225:36.73]I have absolutely no fucking idea what to do with this.
[225:51.64]No!
[225:52.48]No!
[225:54.02]No!
[225:58.48]Oh, God, no!
[225:59.80]Oh, God, no!
[226:07.31]He doesn't know.
[226:08.83]Oh, that hit us.
[226:09.81]That was a direct hit.
[226:15.33]I don't think that was him.
[226:16.87]Was it him?
[226:18.55]Why is he still driving down the road?
[226:22.86]I gotta get this on camera.
[226:31.58]Bye.
[226:32.40]Okay.
[226:33.04]Good.

[231:14.19]Oh, I see.
[231:15.23]It's a big gold star like 500 meters away.
[231:19.88]Did she just scream really loud?
[231:21.92]I'm wondering if it's the cat?
[231:24.60]No.
[231:25.56]Oh, no.
[231:25.86]She's like, yeah.
[231:26.62]She's saying yes.
[231:29.55]Dude, just fast travel.
[231:33.78]I got the bird.
[231:34.98]We can press F in the mini map.
[231:36.98]Or on the big map.
[231:44.08]Where'd the bird go?
[231:47.15]Hey, uh, hit up the map.
[231:50.39]Fast travel to the big blue.
[231:52.25]Oh.
[231:53.67]There we go.
[231:54.25]Much faster.
[232:05.93]Do you have a solid state drive?
[232:08.59]Yeah, I do.
[232:10.75]Am I still loading?
[232:12.55]Yeah.
[232:14.01]3090 omegalo.
[232:18.94]That doesn't compute data, but, you know, keep flexing.
[232:29.21]What a sellout.
[232:30.23]I bought, no, it's called, I got scammed.
[232:34.23]I'm one of the people that built their computer, like, seven months ago, eight months ago.
[232:40.03]And graphics cards, you couldn't get them.
[232:41.96]It was so hard to get.
[232:42.84]I have some bad news for you.
[232:45.12]What?
[232:46.54]You still can't.
[232:49.66]Oh, really?
[232:50.60]Oh, shit.
[232:52.73]But I needed a graphics card.
[232:56.19]I waited and waited and waited and waited and tried over and over again to get something that wasn't a 3090.
[232:59.71]And I was like, alright, I need to get a graphics card.
[233:03.56]I was like, I don't even care.
[233:09.32]You paid $50,000 for a 3090.
[233:10.24]No, I did not.
[233:11.98]This is taking a very long time, I will say, though.
[233:14.81]Yeah, I think it's a... I'm going to say game probably crashed in the loading screen.
[233:19.98]3090, but no 1080p stream, Metallix.
[233:21.84]I would let you take this one.
[233:23.04]Would you like to explain that?
[233:25.42]Um... Sure.
[233:27.60]See, you have to get approved by Twitch to have more than 6 megabit per second up for 1080p to look good.
[233:35.61]Why does 1080p not look good at 6,000 up?
[233:38.39]Could you explain that for the audience, please?
[233:40.19]Because bitrate sucks and, uh, cocks.
[233:46.48]It's the OX, the Internet, but also Congress.
[233:48.92]For a second, I was like, what are you doing?
[233:53.11]What the fuck?
[233:53.79]I got error-coded.
[233:55.31]Oh, no!
[233:57.33]Alright.
[233:58.11]Well, we have to... Wait, hopefully it doesn't script the whole game.
[234:00.65]Is that going to mess the game up?
[234:05.58]Oh, shit.
[234:08.10]You host it, though, right?
[234:09.44]So we should do your game.
[234:11.81]yeah I am trying to load back in I will never fast travel ever again that was the problem you know you know how every single video game always says never close your game during like a loading screen and our game just crashed during a loading screen that's a lot of and I'm I press continue to like continue my game and I'm in another loading screen I'm just gonna force quit the game
[234:38.76]I'm in the process of force quitting.
[234:40.44]Oh, I'm in.
[234:42.16]Wait, you got in?
[234:44.82]I'm in.
[234:45.78]I'm not.
[234:47.22]Yeah, because you have to join me.
[234:48.76]Yeah, but I'm still stuck in the loading screen.
[234:51.36]Oh.
[234:53.78]Yeah, you've got to force quit then.
[234:55.18]God damn it.
[234:56.92]I'm still hearing the game's audio and the game's force quit.
[235:00.90]Is she your number?
[235:02.87]I'm very upset right now.
[235:07.19]Why is this the game?
[235:10.59]Three people.
[235:15.49]There is no Ubisoft game open right now, and I still hear the music of the loading menu.
[235:22.47]Is it just me, or does it sound like I'm like Witcher music?
[235:26.42]You still have a... This is weird.
[235:27.96]I've closed everything.
[235:32.08]It says Far Cry 6 is running right now.
[235:34.02]What?
[235:36.06]Okay, I need to like... Give me a sec.
[235:40.69]I'm forced to quit the application, but it's already closed.
[235:50.40]2021 AAA release.
[235:53.14]Oh, megalol.
[235:53.84]You know what I mean?
[235:56.56]Come back in.
[236:00.01]AAA doesn't exist anymore.
[236:02.67]What's your favorite game of all time?
[236:11.07]Uh, Knights of the Old Republic.
[236:12.83]Tied with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time, of course.
[236:16.37]That's a good one.
[236:16.79]That's good.
[236:17.95]That's a good pick.
[236:25.56]Alright.
[236:26.72]I should be ready to be invited momentarily here once this can actually open the game.
[236:37.32]What's your favorite game of all time besides Mario RPG?
[236:41.93]Or Team Fortress.
[236:44.65]If I had to say.
[236:45.27]That was a real softball.
[236:46.95]I mean, it is.
[236:48.01]It just is.
[236:49.97]Okay.
[236:51.27]I gauge how much I like a game based on how much time I put into a game.
[236:56.25]So, I've put the most time into, like, Team Fortress.
[237:00.46]Into, like, World of Warcraft.
[237:02.04]Although, I would say World of Warcraft should be on that list up until, like, Wrath of the Lich King.
[237:06.50]That's it.
[237:09.11]Wow doesn't exist in my brain, really, until after Wrath of the Lich King.
[237:13.12]Alright, I'm ready for an invite.
[237:17.72]If you can give one to me.
[237:23.04]Zero.
[237:23.44]Oh, hold on.
[237:29.13]Alright, well.
[237:31.43]Continue game.
[237:32.75]New game.
[237:33.73]Add-ons.
[237:34.75]Store.
[237:35.59]Options.
[237:36.57]Quit to desktop.
[237:38.07]Quit
[237:38.92]Quit to desktop.
[237:40.30]Okay.
[237:40.84]You ready?
[237:41.74]Continue.
[237:43.10]Menu narration is disabled.
[237:44.76]Alright, I'm ready.
[237:47.48]How do I... Oh, right.
[237:48.68]Did you just send me one?
[237:51.38]I did, yeah.
[237:52.83]Why do I not see it?
[237:53.73]Oh, I turned off notifications.
[237:59.31]Wouldn't it be here?
[238:05.23]Should be, yeah.
[238:06.39]Core challenge completed.
[238:07.59]Did you join it?
[238:08.73]Okay, re-invite me.
[238:10.65]Okay.
[238:19.22]Um, why am I not getting it?
[238:21.18]Oh, I just said it again?
[238:22.70]What the hell?
[238:27.12]What the hell?
[238:29.84]Can you, um, just right-click on my name from, like, the friend list?
[238:34.95]And then right-click?
[238:35.87]There we are.
[238:37.01]I found it.
[238:38.55]Worst stream 2021.
[238:39.07]Get that!
[238:40.87]Abandon!
[238:44.01]Thanks for your input.
[238:44.91]And thanks for your feedback.
[238:45.71]Thank you.
[238:45.93]I appreciate it.
[238:48.81]I take all feedback, and I process it, and I put it in, and I process it.
[238:52.24]Thank you.
[238:53.74]Can I make, like, a mean stream joke?
[238:56.16]No.
[238:57.32]Okay.
[239:00.92]Can I do it anyway?
[239:02.24]Why do you want to be mean?
[239:02.98]Don't be mean.
[239:04.12]It's not really mean.
[239:05.30]It's like appeals to the chat at the expense of you.
[239:08.26]Oh, yeah, sure.
[239:09.08]Go on.
[239:10.16]What's here?
[239:10.44]Oh, worst stream of 2021?
[239:13.29]Number 10 out of 10?
[239:14.41]Is that what you're saying?
[239:15.09]You said there's been 10 bad streams this year?
[239:20.11]No, there's been 10 streams this year.
[239:22.55]Oh.
[239:26.77]That's not true.
[239:28.93]That's not true.
[239:33.80]Alright, let's do the crocodile meat.
[239:36.77]You just can't be trusted.
[239:48.73]Me?
[239:49.29]Yeah, you just fired at that guy.
[239:50.73]Stop!
[239:53.15]Why did you shoot a turkey?
[239:55.10]What is that?
[239:56.38]He was a pelican.
[239:58.12]By the way, it'll be soft.
[240:01.82]What is going on here?
[240:04.53]Really?
[240:08.97]What's wrong with you?
[240:10.27]My controls got reset.
[240:12.03]Okay, well, now I have to do this.
[240:16.59]I have to disable this again.
[240:19.05]People are sending me messages.
[240:29.52]Hold on.
[240:29.86]Let me turn off notifications.
[240:34.57]Who fucking has that?
[240:39.82]It was me.
[240:41.78]Did you leak me?
[240:42.64]Did you leak me?
[240:43.34]Oh, you leaked me.
[240:45.42]I got some bad news.
[240:46.90]120 gigabytes of my computer have leaked onto the BitTorrent.
[240:51.84]No, you don't.
[240:52.66]No, no.
[240:53.20]I don't want... No, no.
[240:54.30]No more leaks.
[241:00.50]Alright, I'm ready.
[241:07.15]But no, when I tried to invite you from the in-game menu, it popped up.
[241:13.09]Oh, I don't care.
[241:15.17]I don't care.
[241:16.01]It's my Epic Games Launcher account.
[241:19.73]I'm not concerned about it.
[241:27.92]Fuck you, bro!
[241:32.47]Listen, I think we can all just blame Ubisoft.
[241:35.61]Because you can see their shitty overlay inside games.
[241:40.90]Well, you can actually blame Ubisoft for having Ubisoft connect in the first place.
[241:48.00]Alright, so we don't fast travel, but we have to go all the way down here.
[241:51.15]I haven't mocked.
[242:04.11]So like getting in the car and like turning the radio off feels like getting an Uber on quiet mode.
[242:09.59]Like they're like jamming out in the car.
[242:11.11]But then since you asked for like silence, they pick you up and they turn it off.
[242:30.05]That's an option.
[242:31.31]Yeah.
[242:34.07]Although, sometimes you will pick that option.
[242:37.71]And they probably just don't even like... Okay, um... I'm just trying to... Did you get out?
[242:51.65]No, I'm here.
[242:53.15]I'm just watching.
[242:54.25]Who's the blip on the map?
[242:58.81]Um... I mean, you ran over a guy.
[243:05.03]Yeah, I've picked quiet ride before.
[243:06.81]I was like, alright, let's have a quiet ride.
[243:11.33]And you get picked up and the person's just like, hey, howdy, how are you?
[243:14.70]How you doing, stranger?
[243:15.44]And it's just like, oh, shit.
[243:26.98]So, what are you up to in town?
[243:29.66]I'm just like, oh, I guess you didn't look at the thing that I clicked.
[243:38.12]And I wonder if sometimes... Do you... Alex, do you think... Do you think that people look at that after they get picked up?
[243:44.28]Like, if you get picked up and you know that you were talking?
[243:47.51]Do you think you get really pissed off at yourself after seeing that afterwards?
[243:51.57]Are you like... Oh my god, that person wanted me to shut the fuck up and I talked for 30 straight minutes.
[243:59.45]See, that's what I did when I got in here, but I just didn't want to say anything.
[244:06.66]I feel like that's a really, really scary moment where you're just like, alright, see you later.
[244:10.22]Have a wonderful trip.
[244:11.48]It's been a great time having you in the car.
[244:13.24]You look over and you see like in the settings, they picked quiet ride.
[244:16.07]That's what I was saying.
[244:19.71]I picked quiet ride.
[244:20.53]But anyway, thank you.
[244:21.67]Thank you.
[244:22.09]It's been fun.
[244:23.71]I'll be sure to leave a five-star review.
[244:26.76]And I'm changing my tip right now.
[244:29.04]No.
[244:32.14]That's what you were doing.
[244:34.85]Alright, so we have this quest, but where does he want us to go?
[244:37.28]10 to 12 minutes.
[244:41.28]No longer.
[244:42.98]Don't take too long with that prison truck.
[244:47.98]Is that the meat one?
[244:52.17]Uh, this is a main quest.
[244:55.51]The meat one is... We have to find crocodiles.
[245:00.89]Also, are we gonna do the meme quest?
[245:04.24]What's the meme?
[245:09.58]This is the meme.
[245:10.66]What do you do?
[245:15.18]Well, if the menu didn't come up, this would have done it.
[245:18.14]So it was going to happen regardless.
[245:19.96]Because you're also on this screen.
[245:22.36]I don't understand.
[245:25.47]You have to press... You have to talk to this guy and press ready.
[245:27.93]Do we play?
[245:35.28]Can you, like, speak to this dude?
[245:36.70]I can't talk to this guy.
[245:39.34]How come I'm ready and you're not?
[245:42.50]Oh, what the fuck?
[245:43.72]This guy.
[245:44.14]It's not even my name.
[245:45.54]That's somebody else's.
[245:46.22]That's a fake name somebody would have.
[245:48.52]You need to find and pick at least one rooster.
[245:49.96]Oh, we don't have one.
[245:50.64]There's one in a box.
[245:51.10]I picked one up.
[246:09.38]I don't get it.
[246:11.18]Roosters.
[246:16.17]That's a rooster?
[246:20.99]Ah, there was one inside of like a crate.
[246:26.96]Do I have it too?
[246:27.66]I think because you picked it up.
[246:29.90]Maybe since I picked it up, both of us got it.
[246:32.10]I guess.
[246:32.92]Because I'm ready.
[246:36.24]What is this?
[246:38.52]Who am I inviting?
[246:40.18]Are we in a game?
[246:43.46]Yeah, I don't... How do you start this?
[246:47.51]How do you start this?
[246:48.63]Here, let me... Okay, there we go.
[246:51.87]Wait, oh.
[246:54.99]What the fuck is this?
[247:01.01]Bet.
[247:04.74]Why is there a character select screen?
[247:07.28]Look at this.
[247:10.48]You know, Etalyx has the secret DLC cucks.
[247:13.33]There actually aren't any DLC cucks.
[247:18.01]What the fuck?
[247:21.53]Wait, we're actually gonna do this?
[247:30.26]It's like Street Fighter?
[247:36.10]I don't know how to do this.
[247:38.41]What?
[247:39.67]How do you fight?
[247:40.79]I don't know.
[247:41.15]What's the attack buttons?
[247:46.68]E?
[247:46.88]I'm pressing like every button.
[247:56.35]I can't.
[247:56.69]There's no, like, attack.
[247:58.19]Yeah, there is no attack.
[247:59.05]Hold on.
[247:59.31]This is like every new fighting game.
[248:02.40]Back up.
[248:02.90]Back up.
[248:03.32]I'm just going to practice some combos over here in the corner.
[248:06.90]Mouse one?
[248:08.91]Yeah.
[248:09.51]Yeah.
[248:09.75]Don't fight me yet.
[248:10.35]JKL.
[248:10.43]Oh.
[248:27.09]This is kind of fucked up.
[248:28.43]Don't you think?
[248:31.43]Well, like, before or after we murdered all the civilians.
[248:37.56]Yeah.
[248:37.72]You have to build a meter?
[248:50.02]Okay, first of all, there's like 25 characters in this.
[248:53.58]Okay, how do you block
[249:03.56]There is a meter.
[249:05.16]Yeah, there's a meter.
[249:06.06]Left control?
[249:08.74]Did you do super?
[249:11.09]What the fuck?
[249:13.05]How do you do super?
[249:14.13]It was left control.
[249:15.29]Come on, come on.
[249:27.91]They spent way too much time on this.
[249:38.91]I'm like getting sweaty right now.
[249:44.83]And then flap right over your head.
[249:56.57]What?
[249:56.95]Dude.
[249:57.58]We're like holding it like, oh, good job.
[249:59.66]Like petting the chicken?
[250:03.28]What?
[250:04.84]The fuck?
[250:09.19]Oh, dude.
[250:10.23]Dude, this is fucked.
[250:16.39]Alright, well, you can unlock 25 different chickens and you can fight with them.
[250:22.70]You can, yeah.
[250:26.31]Now, let's go back to playing the other game that I think is significantly more tasteful, where my attack dog can rip the throat out of the people that I have trained it to.
[250:34.94]And I can go back to running over civilians with tractors and shooting people mindlessly in the head.
[250:40.44]I think that's a little bit more tasteful, guys.
[250:44.82]Alright, let's go.
[250:45.62]Do we have to go to the road?
[250:56.76]Good point.
[251:02.76]So where's this?
[251:03.22]Do you have this on your map?
[251:04.60]I don't have this on my map.
[251:06.58]I saw them down at the road.
[251:11.48]In... There we go.
[251:13.15]Well, we have options.
[251:14.33]Oh, okay.
[251:15.01]We can do this.
[251:17.75]We can do... Whatever this purple quest is.
[251:31.29]Why don't you give us something cool to do while I spawn a plane?
[251:41.30]How big is the map?
[251:41.88]It's actually pretty large.
[251:47.01]We like just got to the main island.
[251:49.23]Yeah, but if it's anything like any of the other Ubisoft games, it's probably just a copy and paste of this five times.
[252:01.19]Assassin's Creed Valhalla was actually too big.
[252:05.74]It was unplayed.
[252:06.30]It was like, no, there's no way to finish.
[252:10.12]Yeah, as we go into the next generation of video games, I don't, a selling point for a game is not how big a map is, right?
[252:19.94]I feel like people are still on that.
[252:22.76]Yeah, there's no reason to make a game like an adventure action game, like 300 hours where all you do is pop in and out of cover to shoot your enemies and listen to cutscenes.
[252:33.34]Sorry, Red Dead.
[252:34.54]Wait, you just talked shit about Red Dead?
[252:38.33]Yeah, it was a bait and switch.
[252:39.37]You thought I was talking about a Ubisoft game, but really I was talking about Red Dead 2.
[252:41.79]I just fucking threw up for a second.
[252:45.83]What did you say about Red Dead being... You don't like it?
[252:49.03]Why did you say that again?
[252:51.13]I just said it was like too long.
[252:53.00]How could you possibly finish it?
[252:55.28]I love that game.
[253:02.30]Etalyx is based.
[253:03.76]No, I am.
[253:04.55]I'm based.
[253:05.19]I'm the base one.
[253:06.21]Stop saying that.
[253:13.99]No, you're cringe.
[253:17.66]It's true.
[253:22.30]Okay.
[253:23.24]Odds of you turning abruptly and ramming this directly into the mountain?
[253:27.14]Zero.
[253:29.25]Okay.
[253:30.05]Okay, we have to.
[253:32.33]I have to move.
[253:32.95]It's just a fucking stupid airspace.
[253:42.79]I freaked out.
[253:50.88]I could just feel it coming off.
[253:52.42]Yeah, I didn't do that on purpose.
[253:53.94]I think that was self-fulfilling prophecy level of destiny where I created the scenario.
[254:01.60]I think so.
[254:06.42]Well, the thing just starts beeping in my ear and it's like... The person says a missile is going to hit us.
[254:11.84]I'm going to try to freak out.
[254:14.70]Okay, hang on.
[254:15.40]Let me pick a different mission.
[254:16.62]Let me guess.
[254:17.62]He doesn't show up.
[254:19.44]We can, um, steal some spurs.
[254:25.01]We can steal a military truck.
[254:28.19]We need to do the dachshund quest.
[254:33.95]Both of our chats are not going to be happy if we don't do the dachshund quest.
[254:37.17]We both have dachshunds.
[254:40.06]Chorizo.
[254:40.76]Chorizo the dachshund.
[254:46.33]Alright, helicopter.
[254:47.11]You drive it.
[254:47.83]I don't want... You know what's going to happen if I do.
[254:49.99]It says there are lots of crocs.
[254:53.09]Try searching Serpentino Park.
[254:57.19]Where's Serpentino Park?
[254:59.85]Oh, Serpentino Park.
[255:04.00]Okay, I see a spot.
[255:06.12]Is it in the same area we are in?
[255:07.86]It's pretty close.
[255:09.98]It's like almost walking distance.
[255:11.76]Do you not have a wingsuit still?
[255:14.23]No.
[255:15.15]Unless it's in my inventory and I have to equip it or something.
[255:21.61]Did you have to equip it?
[255:23.97]No, I just built a camp building.
[255:27.83]Come talk to this foreman and see.
[255:33.77]Maybe he'll just give it to me?
[255:35.85]Maybe.
[255:41.51]The crocodiles are down there.
[255:42.76]Did you mark them?
[255:43.90]Yeah.
[255:49.22]Only player one gets the wingsuit.
[255:50.77]Oh.
[255:51.67]Really?
[255:52.23]Really.
[255:53.49]You have to play single player in order to unlock it because you're the co-op partner.
[255:58.93]Oh, so your character doesn't like... So wait, do I not exist?
[256:02.23]Is this one of those games?
[256:04.41]Yeah, I think it's one of those anything that happens only happens in my game.
[256:09.72]You know what's really, really, really annoying about all that?
[256:12.42]If that's true, they push the fact that this whole campaign can be played in co-op.
[256:20.00]If you're gonna make that a huge part of your selling point for the game, and again, the whole campaign's playable in co-op, grab a friend!
[256:28.85]But don't let him leave.
[256:30.87]Don't let your fucking friend leave.
[256:37.35]At least give me, like, the major, like, plot points or something so I don't have to do the whole thing.
[256:48.58]Because I could definitely do this.
[256:51.60]You get to have the fun.
[256:56.72]Bye.
[257:06.83]I think I got you once, didn't I?
[257:08.38]You hit me once.
[257:21.46]dude she could be as cool as me with all my premium guns my suit skin hold on while I'm waiting for you to come I'm gonna equip one of my new premium skins alright let's see how much I care about this is it on well I just saw the curtain pull back from the game that just spawned in
[257:50.55]I have cowboy boots.
[257:53.63]And a hat.
[257:55.45]He's not going to shoot us, right?
[257:57.97]Put your gun away.
[257:58.49]Put your gun away.
[257:58.91]Yeah, nice.
[258:04.24]They can't see through your disguise, you budgeteer pyro cosplay.
[258:11.44]I guess they're unhappy.
[258:14.24]I think they've noticed that we look extremely suspicious.
[258:25.56]How are you supposed to deal with tanks?
[258:28.30]I think you're supposed to avoid them.
[258:31.78]Alright, get in the car.
[258:36.48]I have no heals.
[258:45.06]Who is that standing in the... What?
[258:46.68]Who is somebody standing in the middle of the road?
[258:50.82]Who is this person?
[258:53.74]Oh.
[258:59.80]I'm down.
[259:03.04]That escalates very quickly.
[259:06.01]We can't avoid the tanks.
[259:06.99]We stood there for too long.
[259:13.99]Has Jerma ever played a video game?
[259:15.67]Back in the late 80s, I played Mario 1 and 2 and stuff.
[259:19.99]I haven't played anything since Mario 3.
[259:27.24]We played Pong recently.
[259:32.20]Alright, we're going to stay on the road.
[259:33.46]We're not going to stop for anything.
[259:34.48]We're not going to shoot anybody.
[259:35.36]We're just going to drive on the road.
[259:36.90]We're going to go where we're supposed to go.
[259:40.93]Are you in loading screen?
[259:42.53]Yes, I am.
[259:43.51]We're currently stuck in here again.
[259:44.57]Uh-oh.
[259:46.17]When are you going to stream Q-Bert?
[260:00.91]When are they going to give Bomb Moms their own game?
[260:02.59]Like, how come Toad gets one?
[260:13.02]How come... Games made by, like, one person?
[260:21.55]Like, don't have you, like, get disconnected to their loading screen.
[260:29.07]They spent a lot of money on this loading screen.
[260:31.21]This was a high tier commission.
[260:33.00]Like there are games right now that were made by like three people and they run like flawlessly.
[260:49.10]Uh, I just got booted out of the game.
[260:57.63]He hates the game.
[260:58.83]No.
[261:00.33]I actually think it's fun.
[261:01.63]These games are all fun.
[261:02.37]They're all 6 out of 10s, but they're fun to play.
[261:06.31]Maybe more fun if we didn't have to reload in because the game crashes on a loading screen.
[261:10.77]Yeah.
[261:14.71]Yeah, I'm just gonna hard restart.
[261:16.25]How long have we been streaming for?
[261:17.33]I feel like it's been a while.
[261:19.28]Time flies when you're having fun.
[261:22.80]Alright, I'm gonna force quit the game again.
[261:28.81]He hates the game.
[261:30.25]I don't hate the game.
[261:31.05]How long have we been streaming for?
[261:32.12]I just want... No, it's different.
[261:37.94]It's not what you think.
[261:44.69]Okay, force quit again.
[261:46.05]It's still... It's not even on my...
[261:59.26]6 out of 10?
[261:59.98]Is that the number of times that the game loads back in after you die?
[262:05.03]I... I... I... Okay, thank God.
[262:07.53]I thought I was going to have to restart my computer.
[262:12.19]Alright.
[262:13.46]Strike 3.
[262:14.66]Strike 3 and you're up.
[262:16.52]Ubisoft.
[262:17.26]I'm telling you right now.
[262:17.92]Strike 3 and you're up.
[262:20.78]Coming back.
[262:23.92]Just don't die, forehead.
[262:25.58]We just have to not die and just run to where we need to go.
[262:36.75]And hey, me and Etalyx talked about playing this.
[262:40.49]And we even said, what did we say?
[262:42.51]Let's wait like a week or so.
[262:45.15]So maybe they'll iron out the connection problem stuff, right?
[262:49.83]You think there will be a patch in the first week?
[262:51.97]No, I don't know.
[262:57.05]It was running fine for like four hours.
[262:59.01]That's what I don't understand.
[263:02.77]Maybe I should have done a full hard reset of my game too.
[263:05.09]It's only been three days.
[263:07.01]Has it really?
[263:07.39]I thought it's been like five.
[263:15.82]Can you just join off me or do I need to invite you?
[263:17.74]Let me see if I can join you.
[263:22.95]This is another one of those games that has like 12 splash screens before you get to the game.
[263:26.83]Alright, can I join off of you?
[263:33.06]Let's find out.
[263:38.56]When the game is working, there's actually probably fewer bugs than Far Cry 5 had.
[263:47.17]Uh, I'm apparently offline somehow.
[263:51.81]Let me see if I can just join you.
[263:57.90]But also, I was basically playing with training weights because I've been playing the Battlefield beta.
[264:05.42]And I have a total misconception of what constitutes a buggy game after playing that because...
[264:14.05]I can go to my friends list.
[264:15.65]I have three icons.
[264:17.40]One of them is a controller, one of them is a chat bubble, and one of them is the three dots.
[264:20.88]I don't know what any of them do.
[264:22.78]I'm going to try to press them.
[264:24.70]I think I can invite you, but I can't join you.
[264:26.60]I think you're going to have to invite me again.
[264:36.67]Okay.
[264:38.67]Resident Sleeper?
[264:39.31]Yeah, I would be too.
[264:41.03]I am right now, actually.
[264:42.91]I am Resident Sleeper-ing right now.
[264:46.61]Go to the new play launcher on your desktop.
[264:52.79]It says you're offline for me.
[264:54.05]I don't know why.
[264:59.81]Did you get that?
[265:00.79]I got that, but I don't know why it says you're offline.
[265:03.15]Alright, here we go.
[265:04.59]As I'm online, I'm mine.
[265:05.94]Crack your knuckles.
[265:09.42]Let's go.
[265:11.60]Okay.
[265:13.52]Okay, cool.
[265:15.74]We're back.
[265:19.66]I'm in a plane.
[265:21.24]Are you in the plane?
[265:22.16]I guess I'm just in a plane.
[265:22.90]I don't think this is a good idea.
[265:24.56]We gotta just abandon the plane before we both crash and reset the game.
[265:30.91]Get in the plane.
[265:31.93]I'm gonna fly.
[265:32.87]We're gonna jump out of our parachutes and get out.
[265:35.99]That's funny.
[265:39.35]Good idea.
[265:39.93]I like that idea.
[265:41.07]Okay.
[265:41.62]Another plane bit.
[265:44.68]No, this is not going to... Wait, I'm not even driving.
[265:46.22]You are.
[265:52.16]Just get us close enough.
[265:54.00]Once we're in the red area, the red zone, we're going to jump out and just float.
[265:58.17]Nice.
[265:58.37]Very nice.
[266:08.77]Very nice.
[266:09.17]Can you turn the view angle?
[266:12.49]I don't think so.
[266:17.23]How low do you think I can fly without?
[266:19.17]Okay, and it's time to get out.
[266:22.89]I'm up.
[266:29.00]Did you get out?
[266:30.20]No.
[266:30.30]Let me know.
[266:32.64]I'm still in the plane.
[266:35.18]Where?
[266:36.00]You're going too far from your partner.
[266:40.75]Wait, why did it put me back in the plane?
[266:42.45]I don't want to be in the plane.
[266:44.13]I want to get out of the plane.
[266:46.07]I'm getting out of the plane.
[266:46.95]No.
[266:53.00]Okay.
[266:55.12]No, don't pull me back in the plane.
[266:56.42]It's going to pull me back in the plane.
[266:58.86]You're too far.
[267:03.14]I want one of us to survive so we don't have to have the... How are you?
[267:06.50]Wait, you're alive.
[267:07.19]You're fine.
[267:08.04]Yeah, everything's chill.
[267:10.53]I'm not sure why you're in such a panic, to be honest.
[267:12.59]Because we were in the red zone.
[267:14.81]Yeah, but there's an actual pilot right this time who doesn't just crash into the mountain at the first beep in his ear.
[267:21.43]He has some composure and gets back to safety.
[267:25.16]We have to go here.
[267:27.62]You got us to our destination.
[267:28.60]You did a good job.
[267:39.56]You alright?
[267:40.06]Yeah.
[267:41.88]I'm here.
[267:42.88]In fact, I'm here first.
[267:46.06]Oh, yeah?
[267:48.74]You're welcome.
[267:50.02]Imagine if we both bailed out the first time.
[267:51.83]We'd be in the jungle, lost.
[267:53.33]That's true.
[267:54.41]And we'd have to walk like 500 meters.
[267:57.20]So I just saved the stream like 12 minutes of aimlessly wandering while we're trying to scramble for something entertaining to say.
[268:03.90]That's true.
[268:04.48]Try to get a laugh in order to distract the resident sleepers in chat.
[268:07.18]That's true.
[268:08.26]Yeah, that's right.
[268:08.86]You got it.
[268:09.12]You know what you're talking about.
[268:11.75]Alright.
[268:11.95]Here we go.
[268:19.11]Steal favorite spurs.
[268:24.27]We'd be stealthed.
[268:27.96]I don't know why this quest is not what I came here for.
[268:31.84]Yeah, I thought we were doing the Dachshund quest.
[268:36.24]There's supposed to be crocodiles in the area above?
[268:44.67]Or alligators?
[268:46.89]Well, we can do both.
[268:47.63]What's the difference?
[268:49.31]I actually don't know.
[268:50.43]Which ones are native to America?
[268:54.11]Lots of stuff to collect.
[268:55.27]Who's getting hurt?
[268:56.79]What's hurting us?
[268:57.49]Something's bumping into us or hurting us?
[269:00.09]No?
[269:00.15]My character's making sounds like I was getting hurt.
[269:18.07]Where's all the throwable weapons from Far Cry 5?
[269:20.67]They took out throw weapons and they took out the car with the back doors that could open and trap helicopters in them.
[269:28.02]Why is Windows telling me to switch my language?
[269:47.74]I just changed my input language.
[269:50.54]What?
[269:50.74]Dismiss.
[270:06.55]Something going on down here.
[270:15.39]There's like a turkey over here.
[270:16.91]There's like a big rooster turkey chicken over here.
[270:20.83]Oh, good luck.
[270:21.37]King rooster.
[270:24.01]Do we have to fight it?
[270:27.95]The animals are angry.
[270:33.90]I'm trying to get this a good cinematic angle.
[270:36.82]Oh, that was... That was anticlimactic.
[270:43.38]Aww.
[270:45.28]my cat just kind of unceremoniously wait um escape the bunker yeah there was a bunch of them my my familiar has taken this quest objectives
[271:14.59]You gotta pay to win cat.
[271:15.95]That's not fair.
[271:16.47]I think this is supposed to be intense?
[271:24.05]No.
[271:24.51]I think this is supposed to be a horror hallway parody.
[271:29.18]Yeah, that was kind of funny.
[271:30.22]Let's go.
[271:36.08]DPS...
[271:52.35]Get out, get out, get out!
[271:54.05]Get out, man, get out!
[272:13.72]Okay, I think, um... Don't leave me in here!
[272:25.18]Dude, get him.
[272:25.66]Watch out.
[272:26.00]Alright, we did it.
[272:28.47]Nice work.
[272:28.87]Let's head back to... It's still very, very dramatic music.
[272:39.41]Okay, objective complete.
[272:44.82]Elvis, it's Donnie.
[272:47.60]That place.
[272:48.78]Flooded shit.
[272:50.08]Birds everywhere.
[272:51.60]There's supposed to be crocodiles here, though.
[272:53.57]A chicken put a bullet in me?
[272:59.44]That's 2,000 meters away.
[273:02.56]Oh, my God.
[273:03.34]That's not... That's just the turret.
[273:08.56]So, where's the... The alligators are right here somewhere, right?
[273:12.13]Does it look like it?
[273:13.39]Yeah.
[273:13.55]They should be... Well... No, they're down here.
[273:23.42]I'm not insignificant distance away.
[273:29.62]That's very far.
[273:30.56]That's further than.
[273:31.50]Oh my God.
[273:32.08]It's so far.
[273:34.90]I don't know how this one.
[273:36.05]I feel like I'm driving the car.
[273:38.27]Okay.
[273:40.33]Your ass.
[273:41.49]Oh, sorry.
[273:42.69]That better?
[273:43.11]Careful with your.
[273:53.00]I'm good.
[273:53.26]I think they're going to spike strip us.
[274:11.63]I think so.
[274:15.51]It worked.
[274:19.55]Emergent gameplay.
[274:28.39]Pick up the god damn purse.
[274:30.37]What the hell?
[274:31.27]Alright.
[274:32.43]I am guarding the alarm.
[274:35.11]I think we're okay now.
[274:42.73]The alarm should be broken now, right?
[274:45.47]Uh, I think so.
[274:51.53]Is it like one more guy?
[274:55.49]I think that's it.
[274:57.42]I think if we kill all the guys, we control the checkpoint.
[275:04.21]Oh, something in here.
[275:09.99]We got gunpowder.
[275:12.51]I think gunpowder lets you make guns.
[275:15.01]Oh, alright.
[275:15.41]It's probably just like craft new.
[275:16.63]Tank again.
[275:17.47]I'm just hiding.
[275:21.89]Just hiding here.
[275:23.39]Let's just do the left for dead strategy where everyone goes in the bathroom.
[275:28.50]And everyone aims out the door with auto shotguns.
[275:31.24]I don't think he knows.
[275:37.86]Is he leaving?
[275:39.08]He's investigating, sort of.
[275:43.15]And also crashing.
[275:46.37]Maybe becoming stuck.
[275:51.33]Looks like he's stuck.
[275:52.19]I think we can go.
[275:56.30]Yeah, he's stuck.
[275:56.80]Alright, let's get out of here.
[276:01.62]I mean, I can steal the horse, but... Just get the car.
[276:09.26]I missed.
[276:12.12]Whatever.
[276:15.98]Take this one.
[276:20.28]Uh-oh.
[276:21.42]No, don't just keep driving.
[276:25.36]I don't just keep driving.
[276:34.02]I'm just rolling up.
[276:40.00]This thing doesn't do shit.
[276:49.61]Alright, Mubi, you can jump on the roof of mine.
[276:52.79]I gotta get this shot, come on!
[277:07.59]A movie scene has to play out here.
[277:10.45]A movie scene?
[277:11.35]You're expecting a lot.
[277:14.23]Hey, Etalyx, go to do a movie scene in front of the camera.
[277:17.57]Hey, do something funny.
[277:26.17]Oh, that's a great shot.
[277:27.47]Great angle.
[277:28.98]Actually perfect shot right here.
[277:42.13]Okay, I got an idea.
[277:55.24]Nice and tight right there.
[277:59.19]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[278:00.35]That startled me.
[278:02.09]I thought he crashed into like a wall.
[278:12.32]Cut.
[278:13.98]Yeah, good shot.
[278:14.96]Good scene.
[278:18.30]On to the crocodile meat.
[278:22.87]You drive.
[278:23.89]Okay.
[278:27.29]Thank you, Etalyx.
[278:28.07]Now we don't have to do that for an hour.
[278:30.37]X is gun.
[278:33.48]Oh, cool.
[278:35.32]You kind of put this in a ditch here.
[278:37.80]I mean, I dove out of the car.
[278:39.32]It just went where it was going to go.
[278:41.84]I think we may need a new one.
[278:44.36]No, we're okay.
[278:49.64]The scooper on front is supposed to flip cars, but it doesn't seem to work.
[278:55.20]What just happened?
[278:57.00]You just came to a complete stop.
[278:59.26]Why?
[278:59.94]I don't know.
[279:01.44]Instantly.
[279:02.54]The engine just fell out of the car.
[279:07.22]I think I'm hitting you.
[279:09.49]I think I'm running into you.
[279:11.17]My power as host is simply too great.
[279:14.57]It might be your shield.
[279:16.73]I didn't want to hit all those chickens.
[279:17.86]That's actually a good idea.
[279:19.98]What if you run into me at full speed while I have the shield equipped?
[279:23.70]Will you block it?
[279:25.60]I don't know.
[279:25.90]That's what I wanted to find out.
[279:27.10]Your legs are doing lots of interesting things.
[279:39.33]You want to try it?
[279:43.53]Hold your shield up and put it right in front of the car.
[279:59.40]It works.
[280:00.56]Are you serious?
[280:01.76]Are you kidding me?
[280:03.46]No, it does not.
[280:04.38]Hang on.
[280:04.62]I wonder if it works with the tank.
[280:12.04]I'm fine.
[280:14.47]That shouldn't work.
[280:27.94]You dodged the horse.
[280:28.78]Good job.
[280:29.22]I did.
[280:29.62]I don't wanna hit the horse.
[280:40.56]This Marvel movie is whack.
[280:43.20]Perry to truck.
[280:58.24]Uh, we gotta try, like, a... airplane.
[281:01.27]I- I know, but... What if it blocks explosions?
[281:04.03]Ooh, if I flew into you with an airplane, would you block it?
[281:06.19]That's a good idea.
[281:06.89]Is a good idea.
[281:07.99]That's a really good idea.
[281:10.83]Let's try that in a little bit.
[281:17.02]What happens if I hit V while you're driving?
[281:19.78]It'll probably blow the car up and we'll have to get to a loading screen and be mad at the... Can you see me?
[281:28.22]I can.
[281:28.87]You got hit by a barrel.
[281:32.87]Alright, go faster.
[281:34.47]Yeah, we gotta go this way.
[281:38.75]Alright, go fast.
[281:40.24]Yeah, I'm just going to hit V. Going fast.
[281:45.78]You're still on the car.
[281:46.81]It works.
[281:51.73]Newton's law of physics says that a perpetual motion, something will be in motion until it is out of motion.
[281:57.94]When I was a young boy and I played with trains, I sure did love them.
[282:03.50]And my sister was a very interesting person.
[282:05.90]That's the first 15 seconds of Young Sheldon.
[282:08.87]Thank you very much.
[282:09.49]That was literally the first, like, 30 seconds of Young Sheldon, episode one, pilot.
[282:18.41]Yeah, but it sounded like the right man in the wrong place can make all the difference.
[282:27.82]They're just dropping, like, paratroopers down here.
[282:30.12]Are they firing at us?
[282:36.67]I'm very confused.
[282:37.31]Yeah, they're shooting at us.
[282:38.37]Why?
[282:38.71]What happened?
[282:39.95]We're just here.
[282:40.53]We exist.
[282:41.94]They don't need a reason.
[282:46.50]Well, what the heck?
[282:48.06]I have a shield.
[282:48.54]Why don't you get one?
[282:53.00]Come on, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.
[283:10.44]Get the helicopter.
[283:11.36]Get the helicopter.
[283:11.92]We might be able to fly that out.
[283:14.52]Give me this fucking thing right now.
[283:15.32]Come on.
[283:18.78]Does it let you jump in?
[283:20.28]No.
[283:27.86]What if we get a boat and push it?
[283:30.06]Why is it so hard to get a helicopter in this game?
[283:33.53]I mean, we have access to them.
[283:34.73]It's just... Yeah.
[283:35.81]We're in weird places.
[283:36.45]The shitty one.
[283:37.15]This is the big one.
[283:38.29]So, we're looking for... Looking for crocodiles here.
[283:41.03]There's one.
[283:45.51]Are we supposed to kill them?
[284:02.23]What's this look like to you?
[284:04.19]I don't know.
[284:05.29]I was videoing it.
[284:06.51]I was hoping he was going to kill you.
[284:09.07]I was hoping he was going to kill you.
[284:11.01]And I was going to have a picture of you getting eaten by a crocodile.
[284:13.47]But that didn't happen.
[284:14.51]I got chorizo some crock meat.
[284:16.41]See?
[284:18.69]Smells like spider's bits, doesn't it?
[284:21.33]He's going to love it.
[284:22.48]Chorizo's a little tiny to have a taste for crock meat, no?
[284:25.12]You fucked up, sorry, hero.
[284:30.21]who's this oh dude there's rats they're rats no it's not this is a gopher oh can you can they be friends what is this how do we uh can we like press e or anything
[284:59.57]It's like a beaver.
[285:00.15]I don't know.
[285:00.43]Yeah, that's like a beaver.
[285:05.91]Alright, so now we're going to bring the treat back to Otto.
[285:09.23]Or Midas.
[285:09.93]Either one.
[285:11.37]Hang on.
[285:12.41]Hang on.
[285:12.65]I just got the option to feed.
[285:14.43]Really?
[285:15.61]Yeah, but now I can't see it again because they're like scared.
[285:18.60]Holy shit.
[285:28.12]Damn it.
[285:30.15]Maybe we need to sneak up?
[285:31.01]I don't know.
[285:32.17]It definitely said feed.
[285:39.99]There's more up ahead.
[285:40.91]See if you can get the ones that haven't been spooked yet.
[285:44.02]Yeah.
[285:45.42]Alright.
[285:45.82]Let's creep up.
[285:47.44]Okay.
[285:47.62]That's a jackrabbit.
[285:52.76]Why are we hurting them?
[285:55.15]No, I don't think so.
[285:56.01]We're trying to feed them.
[285:57.32]No, like H-E-R-D.
[286:00.26]Oh, I see.
[286:00.78]We're protecting them.
[286:03.24]I really hope this doesn't lead to a street.
[286:13.78]Pretty game.
[286:16.22]They're just so squeaky.
[286:17.50]Oh, here we go.
[286:19.22]Oh, that's a rabbit.
[286:20.14]Damn it.
[286:21.68]Okay.
[286:23.20]Well, we tried.
[286:25.39]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[286:26.23]Right here, right here.
[286:26.75]Can you feed it?
[286:31.76]I did it.
[286:37.08]And they're just so hungry.
[286:38.14]Oh, my God.
[286:38.64]Do it again, please.
[286:40.34]You have to, like, crouch up to them.
[286:50.35]What are we feeding them?
[286:53.05]Pellets.
[287:02.40]Uh-oh.
[287:04.44]We have a... There's a predator over there.
[287:07.39]Oh, there is.
[287:07.85]There's a wolf just walking around.
[287:12.09]Can you feed the wolf?
[287:13.43]Can you just, like, walk up?
[287:14.29]Can you put your hand out?
[287:18.71]Don't try to feed wolves!
[287:22.98]Help.
[287:23.64]Help.
[287:23.98]I don't know what to do.
[287:26.44]Run to the water.
[287:27.06]Into the water.
[287:27.52]Run to the water.
[287:28.04]He's got my arm.
[287:29.00]Let's get in the water.
[287:35.24]Who's shooting a gun?
[287:36.30]Into the water.
[287:38.80]He won't go in the water.
[287:42.71]Okay.
[287:43.95]Yeah, I guess you're right.
[287:45.19]Okay, new toy.
[287:52.63]We have a new toy?
[287:53.23]There is a new toy.
[287:55.38]A new old toy.
[287:56.20]Also, they're fighting the wolf.
[287:57.90]And it's not going well.
[288:02.90]He's fighting the wolf.
[288:05.39]They threw three molotovs.
[288:11.02]Ah, yes, there is a new toy, old toy.
[288:19.27]Uh, where are we gonna go?
[288:22.21]That's a great question, but we're gonna go somewhere.
[288:25.81]We'll go somewhere.
[288:26.93]Yeah, fuck that dock.
[288:28.88]Who cares?
[288:38.26]How do I get out of here?
[288:44.14]These all dead ends?
[288:44.88]I think they're all dead ends.
[288:49.94]Give me a marker.
[288:52.16]You're just vlogging?
[288:54.03]Alright, yeah, I'll give you a marker.
[288:56.61]Um, we have to go this way.
[289:01.37]Hold on.
[289:03.57]It's a honeymoon video.
[289:08.60]And I'll be honest with you.
[289:10.61]Put the phone down, right?
[289:12.15]Like, okay.
[289:13.61]Oh, we're having so much fun.
[289:14.69]I'm going to record this.
[289:16.89]No, don't.
[289:17.41]Just like enjoy the vacation right here.
[289:20.87]Where's the marker?
[289:21.67]There are designated things to take pictures of.
[289:24.09]Don't bring your phone into the water.
[289:25.67]What is that?
[289:26.11]Oh, it's an alligator.
[289:32.12]We should be able to go backwards.
[289:34.69]Oh shit!
[289:36.01]What's wrong?
[289:36.95]The alligators!
[289:38.35]Oh, whoa!
[289:46.79]I kinda like wanna see what it'll do.
[289:47.89]They're getting so- Honey, they're getting so close!
[289:51.85]Wow!
[289:52.91]The wildlife over here is really interesting.
[289:54.89]I love being in nature.
[289:56.93]I wanna be out- I wanna be outside all the time.
[289:58.96]I wanna be camping, I wanna be hiking.
[290:04.55]I want to just sunbathe.
[290:05.49]I want to go swimming.
[290:06.57]My camera's, like, broken.
[290:14.68]Oh, what's this over here?
[290:16.14]What?
[290:16.50]This is... Oh, I don't know.
[290:21.74]What did they do?
[290:25.69]Let's go to, like, a safe distance right here.
[290:32.62]I don't think they even care.
[290:33.68]They're stuck.
[290:34.38]Do you want to go help them?
[290:47.31]Can you get on their boat and will they even care?
[290:51.09]Well, it depends on if they notice me, I guess.
[290:52.76]Why don't you stealth up there?
[290:58.64]I think you can stealth up there and take the guy out with the... Wait, see if you can go on the boat and just sit down with him.
[291:06.19]What if I can do one of the swimming machete animations where you're like, there's got to be one to pull the guy off the boat, right?
[291:12.79]I would hope so.
[291:19.62]He notices?
[291:22.48]He's aiming the gun around the boat at you.
[291:24.80]He doesn't want to get off.
[291:28.31]I see that.
[291:34.29]You're holding your camera?
[291:36.55]Yeah.
[291:37.19]Come over to this side around this angle.
[291:39.15]See if you can get him to like point around his left shoulder.
[291:48.18]They're just grooving.
[291:50.04]I feel like I'm taking a picture of you like filming a movie or doing like a photo shoot.
[291:54.72]Okay, they see me when I get like there.
[291:59.95]If I go up there, they can see too.
[292:02.38]Will he fire the gun?
[292:03.26]That's actually a good question.
[292:07.04]If you were to stand up around the left side of the boat... Alright, I'm about to get detected.
[292:10.50]Let's find out.
[292:14.12]I can't jump.
[292:22.32]I'm too puny.
[292:23.40]He can definitely fire if he wanted to right now.
[292:25.27]Go stand right next to him.
[292:26.95]I can't even get up here.
[292:31.31]Alright, give me one sec to reset my, uh, stealth meter.
[292:34.71]Okay.
[292:40.33]I'm filming you.
[292:41.27]I'm filming you.
[292:44.89]Okay, you're up there.
[292:46.03]Nice.
[292:47.05]Very cool.
[292:54.41]What the fuck was that?
[292:59.53]It was...
[293:03.12]That didn't do anything.
[293:05.62]That did nothing.
[293:06.50]Who killed me?
[293:07.36]What the fuck?
[293:09.50]Uh-oh.
[293:09.84]Uh-oh.
[293:16.92]What happened?
[293:17.56]I did like a backflip off the... I hope this loads.
[293:25.74]Please load.
[293:26.52]Come on.
[293:26.84]We're not done yet.
[293:27.62]Yes.
[293:35.75]Feed Chorizo.
[293:36.75]You're going on Facebook.
[293:40.50]Can we like eat these?
[293:41.22]I don't think so.
[293:47.82]Alright, let's go feed the dog.
[293:49.58]Let's actually finish that.
[293:51.52]Like you said.
[293:52.00]I said that.
[293:55.74]Yep.
[293:58.02]Want me to call in a car?
[293:59.78]That would probably be useful.
[294:02.82]When do I get to like call in other cars?
[294:06.56]You probably have to set it.
[294:08.10]Find in a warehouse at the F&D storage facility.
[294:12.12]Complete any grand premio race or go to a chop shop.
[294:24.81]Okay.
[294:25.23]Look at this.
[294:26.81]Oh, I thought he was biting this.
[294:28.65]Whatever it was.
[294:31.43]Hey, thanks.
[294:33.93]Alright.
[294:34.71]You want to drive?
[294:35.35]No.
[294:37.00]uh do you okay yeah you can drive I've been driving a lot why is he pissed is he yeah he didn't he just brought the car to us and he was mad it's because he has to walk home this is unfair why can't oh why can't that guy just not be in the car with us and you drop him off I don't know what happened yeah there's no like are there no familiar people in this game like maybe you can like get followers it seems really unfair
[295:20.25]What?
[295:21.73]Why would you run her?
[295:22.53]She could have gotten in the car.
[295:23.61]I thought she was bad.
[295:24.52]Is she not bad?
[295:26.58]Is this guy bad?
[295:31.60]Yeah, he's bad.
[295:33.51]Alright, pick her up and let her get in the car.
[295:45.86]Alright, let's go.
[295:46.44]This way.
[295:48.20]In the car.
[295:53.43]Point your phone out the window like a hipster vlog.
[295:58.53]She's not getting in the car.
[295:59.39]Can I lean out?
[296:10.45]Okay, let's just go.
[296:19.23]I thought I was going to.
[296:21.88]Take you out.
[296:23.10]Good.
[296:23.70]Excellent.
[296:24.20]Can you do a selfie?
[296:29.80]I don't think so.
[296:30.54]Put away zoom.
[296:33.32]Toggle UI.
[296:33.64]No, you can't.
[296:35.44]What happened there?
[296:48.62]Why is there a skull flying around in the sky?
[296:52.12]Is there a skull in the sky?
[296:53.28]I think that means there's like a... Is that a new Sea of Thieves event?
[296:57.48]I don't know.
[296:57.90]I never played it.
[296:58.36]Probably where Jack Black is.
[297:01.86]Like I said, I wouldn't be surprised if this was just the last game flipped upside down.
[297:08.46]Well, they just like flip horizontally every asset.
[297:15.88]They broke my tires.
[297:17.69]Oh, shit.
[297:23.19]Where's the other guy?
[297:31.60]I don't see anybody.
[297:32.48]Where are they?
[297:37.16]Anybody marked?
[297:39.17]No, I don't.
[297:40.33]Are you marking people?
[297:46.85]They got planes still.
[297:47.89]We just gotta leave.
[297:49.83]Run, run, run, run.
[297:50.77]There's gonna be more people.
[297:54.41]It's only gonna get exacerbated.
[297:55.95]I'm good.
[297:56.21]There's explosives back here.
[297:57.30]Just be aware of that.
[297:57.82]Be careful.
[297:58.50]I have almost zero health.
[298:01.76]I'm dead.
[298:02.76]Oh, shit.
[298:07.26]I can't get out of the fucking backseat of this car.
[298:12.12]I'm just running.
[298:12.56]I'm sorry.
[298:13.40]You'll spawn on me.
[298:22.38]Alright, I'm up.
[298:24.00]Oh, there's a spectator buff.
[298:25.04]Alright, I got away.
[298:32.13]I wonder if when you do, you probably just spawn right on me.
[298:40.25]And we're back.
[298:44.42]Yeah, that's a much better idea.
[298:46.56]What the fuck is this thing?
[298:48.88]A ferret?
[298:51.64]Why is it mad?
[298:53.13]What did I do?
[298:55.27]Because humans have corrupted their natural environments.
[299:01.29]There's a mongoose.
[299:06.99]What are you shooting at?
[299:11.42]What's even down there?
[299:14.24]I was going to get a car.
[299:16.94]Found one.
[299:18.80]Hold on, does this guy have a quest?
[299:23.05]Holy shit!
[299:28.19]No, don't shoot me.
[299:31.93]Alright, get in.
[299:37.72]I'm in.
[299:38.92]Alright, let's head.
[299:39.72]We're just trying to feed the goddamn dachshund, okay?
[299:43.32]Helicopter.
[299:59.03]Of course a tank.
[299:59.51]He ain't gonna hit us.
[300:00.15]I'd be surprised.
[300:04.69]They tend to do that.
[300:27.98]Are we there yet?
[300:28.74]No, I... Oh, no.
[300:31.91]I just... The waypoint's wrong.
[300:39.17]I was trying to cut through here because the waypoint is taking us somewhere else.
[300:45.71]Look, this is the wrong way.
[300:46.91]We need to put the waypoint.
[300:48.83]Waypoint!
[300:50.97]Okay, I'll give you some waypoints.
[300:53.07]Because I'm driving towards this waypoint here.
[300:55.07]You see my waypoint?
[300:57.93]Yeah, it's it.
[301:05.12]Now we have to go this way.
[301:05.88]Alright, the moment that everyone's been waiting for.
[301:15.46]It's finally among us.
[301:19.18]Why?
[301:19.88]Why?
[301:21.34]I can't say two words that are very common together without it being a video game that everybody likes.
[301:28.14]I don't think it contextually even made sense.
[301:41.78]You know, you're probably right.
[301:46.95]What am I doing?
[301:49.32]Excuse me?
[301:49.96]Why did this happen?
[301:59.02]Okay, well, let's go feed the dog.
[302:08.11]I am so ready for this.
[302:09.31]We're feeding the dog crocodile steak.
[302:16.26]are you okay are you gonna be able to see it I think so as long as I'm close probably right the work never ends there never worked so hard for it my god well you deserve it this should be enough to make us amigos right right we did it he's so hungry
[302:46.15]No, you have to eat the rest of the food.
[302:48.54]He doesn't want it.
[302:48.94]We bought you the good stuff.
[302:49.80]You have to eat the rest of it.
[302:52.46]Not hungry.
[302:53.08]It's okay.
[302:58.09]Wait.
[303:01.29]Chorizo has something to show you.
[303:02.77]Where is it?
[303:03.37]What is it?
[303:03.91]I should follow him to find out.
[303:05.55]Really?
[303:06.13]Oh, let's go.
[303:15.68]What you got there?
[303:16.96]Not for me.
[303:20.95]Oh, shit.
[303:22.13]Diamonds.
[303:23.95]Nice.
[303:25.81]You just have to keep following him?
[303:31.41]Yeah.
[303:34.70]He navigates this ramp pretty well.
[303:39.82]Another present.
[303:42.12]I tell.
[303:42.40]You're too good to me.
[303:46.70]Dog's been stealing shit through the whole community and like burying it in corners.
[304:00.41]Even more.
[304:00.95]Well that wasn't really hidden.
[304:05.16]That was just on the counter.
[304:18.66]Okay, but like what if he was one of the attack companions?
[304:24.20]That would be so funny.
[304:32.99]He just moves this slowly around.
[304:34.39]He's messing around.
[304:35.07]He's walking around.
[304:35.77]He is.
[304:46.67]No, he's not.
[304:48.07]He probably helped you steal this shit.
[304:51.38]Gracias, Chorizo.
[304:53.20]I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
[304:55.48]He's got a name tag.
[304:57.28]Really?
[304:59.50]Yeah, so you can equip his name tag.
[305:04.00]That way you remember him anywhere you go.
[305:07.46]Just put like a cute dachshund in your game and everyone won't care about disconnecting with their friend like two times in a row.
[305:17.12]very nice oh shit what it's real really hold on how do you do it hang on what where is he this is pet I can't do it it says pet chorizo

[306:02.59]Are you kidding me?
[306:04.39]Oh, it's on cooldown.
[306:08.11]I can't even get the dog.
[306:12.12]I'm just like trapped.
[306:13.14]I'm trapped like in a mirror or something.
[306:15.70]No, here's what it is.
[306:17.88]You're holding the controller that's not plugged in.
[306:24.15]And pretending like you're playing while I'm playing.
[306:30.13]What the fuck?
[306:35.44]Alright, let's keep going.
[306:39.97]How you doing?
[306:41.17]You doing good?
[306:41.73]You alright?
[306:42.19]I'm good.
[306:42.65]I just got our little friend who actually exists.
[306:45.79]Here he is.
[306:49.81]Oh my goodness.
[306:50.70]I can't believe it.
[306:53.40]I can't believe you can actually use... But what if he gets like attacked?
[306:58.44]He's gonna get like a... You're gonna throw a grenade and it's gonna be bad.
[307:01.22]Can you just go to sleep in the puddle?
[307:05.58]He's sleeping inside of the mud puddle.
[307:07.88]We have to protect this dog at all costs.
[307:10.41]Alright, bring the spurs back.
[307:17.39]Alright, where's the crafting bench?
[307:18.63]Let's make some new toys.
[307:19.91]We'll complete this first.
[307:21.46]We've had this pretty much completed for like an hour.
[307:24.20]Yo, yo, yo.
[307:25.12]Tell me you got good news, compay.
[307:27.18]Man, I'm... Can I be real with you for a second?
[307:31.90]You did something really special right here.
[307:34.30]I want to tell you a secret, okay?
[307:36.33]I throw most of my fights.
[307:38.97]I just can't stand the idea of you getting hurt.
[307:41.49]It burns me up.
[307:42.93]It spurs.
[307:44.73]It makes him happy.
[307:46.51]And that's all that matters.
[307:48.03]Now, you did us a favor, and I trust you.
[307:52.80]But if you say anything to anyone, I'll fuck you up.
[307:57.50]I got a rep to protect, okay?
[308:00.86]Where's my reward?
[308:06.26]Give my quest reward.
[308:08.38]You think I did that out of the goodest of my heart?
[308:11.84]We got it right there.
[308:12.44]Look.
[308:12.54]We're going to be rank four.
[308:17.44]Okay.
[308:17.74]New weapons and gear at Arms Daily.
[308:19.64]Let's go look at some new weapons.
[308:24.77]We should be able to craft some shit.
[308:27.84]Well, you should be able to craft some shit in your cool game that you have.
[308:31.33]No, you can't.
[308:32.25]Anybody can craft stuff.
[308:33.49]We just gotta find the crafting table.
[308:34.77]No, I can't.
[308:35.43]No, I can't.
[308:35.75]I can't.
[308:36.13]I can't do it.
[308:36.47]I can't.
[308:38.55]I don't even want to look.
[308:39.31]Mentally?
[308:39.97]No, I can't.
[308:40.35]I don't even want to look.
[308:40.95]It's stupid.
[308:41.73]I can't do it.
[308:53.50]I actually don't think I can.
[308:57.61]I can go, I can, can I talk to this guy?
[309:00.89]Listen, I'll just, I can throw one of my weapons on the ground and you can pick it up.
[309:04.55]Ah, it's alright man.
[309:06.35]I just, uh, that's fine.
[309:07.89]It's cool.
[309:09.28]As I can't do it.
[309:10.24]I genuinely don't even know where the crafting bench is.
[309:13.62]Yeah, just make a bunch of like shit, whatever, it's fine.
[309:15.18]I don't care.
[309:15.94]Yeah, you know what?
[309:17.20]Um.
[309:18.22]Um.
[309:19.20]It is what it is.
[309:19.64]I will have more fun with my $15 game.
[309:23.76]I mean, it's fucking, it's like fucking stupid.
[309:25.92]Lolo price of $15.
[309:27.22]You know, it's a pretty good deal.
[309:27.96]Alright, just make something and fucking whatever.
[309:33.98]You like push me up.
[309:35.62]You got a new face.
[309:41.46]Oh.
[309:43.70]Yeah.
[309:45.23]Oh.
[309:47.13]Fucking probably, uh.
[309:50.45]I'm building my base.
[309:52.79]Hang on, I gotta wait for your approval, though.
[309:54.81]Oh, no.
[309:57.35]You need my approval.
[309:58.29]Okay, let me deliberate on this.
[310:20.25]Oh, I thought this was going to sell weapons.
[310:21.81]They sell clothes.
[310:23.31]Clothes?
[310:29.27]Give me one second.
[310:30.67]Got a raid from Chibli.
[310:32.95]Thanks for the raid, Chibli.
[310:36.39]What's going on, everybody?
[310:37.45]Thanks for joining.
[310:38.05]Playing Far Cry 6.
[310:42.67]My buddy, Etalyx.
[310:46.04]How are you guys doing?
[310:49.84]I have Etalyx muted and deafened and he probably doesn't know what's going on, but thanks for the raid.
[310:54.00]Welcome, everybody.
[310:58.87]So, um... Where do you want to go from here?
[311:01.91]What would you like to do?
[311:05.67]Uh...
[311:07.94]I'll let you choose because I feel like my game is kind of better than yours.
[311:11.99]I've got the Dachshund dog pet.
[311:15.31]I've got the premium weapons.
[311:17.35]I've got the awesome clothes.
[311:20.51]It's a better game.
[311:22.77]It's a cooler game, but I think we can do what you kind of feel like because you're the one that has to be the quarterback here.
[311:31.60]Yeah, you do have a point.
[311:33.42]Anything we do really doesn't impact your save at all.
[311:37.95]Even though you own the game and I technically I'm renting it so No, let's go do well.
[311:44.24]Let's go fly.
[311:44.70]I want to fly a plane.
[311:45.52]I want to be in a plane Somebody's did somebody's throw a glass at the dog Who the fuck just did that who did that?
[311:51.44]Alright, let's go fly a plane spawn a plane and I went flat, okay just What's this controller icon
[312:11.85]I don't know.
[312:12.42]Wait, what is it?
[312:12.92]Yeah.
[312:13.40]Interact.
[312:14.70]Oh.
[312:15.54]Add-ons.
[312:16.26]They're DLC.
[312:16.94]Aren't these just characters from the other games?
[312:22.92]Yeah.
[312:23.18]I think that for some reason is somehow that also you, okay.
[312:27.08]If you don't move, I literally can't finish the game.
[312:29.86]Like if you went AFK right here.
[312:31.90]Yeah.
[312:32.46]I am a hundred percent boxed in.
[312:35.32]Really?
[312:35.60]There's no jumping in this mode.
[312:40.47]You just stuck.
[312:41.33]You just, you just put me in a Minecraft, like dirt, dark hut while I was using the bathroom.
[312:48.55]Oh, alright.
[312:49.11]Let's get in the plane.
[312:52.44]What time is it right now?
[312:53.18]When do we start?
[312:53.88]2?
[312:56.66]I got like another 40 minutes in me.
[313:02.64]Let's get some new vehicles and weapons.
[313:04.84]We gotta get new toys.
[313:05.32]Yeah, we need new toys.
[313:06.22]There's a crafting bench in there somewhere.
[313:10.08]I don't know where it is.
[313:13.38]There's a helicopter now.
[313:15.18]Or there was then, but there is now too.
[313:17.84]Can we have two different vehicles?
[313:20.43]Okay, so you want the plane.
[313:23.17]Why don't we try the shield?
[313:23.85]No, I want the helicopter.
[313:24.49]Okay, well, pick one.
[313:26.57]Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[313:27.62]Let's try the shield thing.
[313:28.72]That's a good idea.
[313:32.40]How are we going to do this?
[313:33.64]Where are you going to be?
[313:34.38]I'm just going to go to the end of the runway.
[313:35.76]I have to, like, pitch this down, then.
[313:46.19]Alright, the plane is currently moving, so I can't really stop it.
[313:49.15]Alright, just accelerate.
[313:50.13]Alright, here we go.
[314:00.06]Not that time.
[314:02.94]Didn't save me that time.
[314:04.18]I'm alright.
[314:08.04]Spawn in here?
[314:09.18]Yeah.
[314:11.80]I ground you up.
[314:13.33]Alright, where to?
[314:14.59]Can you grapple onto stuff?
[314:18.90]Is the grapple still in the game?
[314:20.03]That's just cause.
[314:21.75]No, no, no.
[314:22.21]That was Far Cry 5.
[314:22.81]It was?
[314:23.55]We were doing like grapple onto the helicopter.
[314:26.95]Remember we were trying to like do the physics bounce?
[314:31.72]Oh, I don't know.
[314:32.14]Maybe we have to unlock it.
[314:32.82]Into the helicopter blades?
[314:33.88]We probably have to unlock it.
[314:39.18]I'm going to a waypoint right now.
[314:40.52]What's this waypoint for?
[314:45.97]Attention unidentified pilot.
[314:48.11]This airspace is restricted.
[314:49.83]Land now.
[314:50.97]I don't know what to do.
[314:51.71]I'm panicking.
[314:52.11]I actually don't.
[314:54.57]I forgot how to drive the fucking plane.
[314:56.25]I don't know what to do.
[314:58.83]I cannot move my mouth.
[315:00.37]I can't move my mouth.
[315:02.17]Just get out.
[315:02.53]Just get out.
[315:02.85]Just get out.
[315:03.37]Just get out.
[315:12.66]You good?
[315:14.86]Yes.
[315:24.66]I can't look down.
[315:35.07]There you are.
[315:36.89]I'm going to try to make a cool landing in front of you, okay?
[315:40.40]Okay.
[315:41.72]Just stay still?
[315:43.30]Yep.
[315:45.20]We get this on camera, right?
[315:46.70]Like, pull out your camera.
[315:57.22]Here I come.
[316:00.12]It doesn't look like you're going towards me.
[316:01.92]I am.
[316:05.23]Alright, now revive me.
[316:09.81]That was fun.
[316:15.07]I was going to try to land on your camera lens, but that would have been really, really probably impossible to do.
[316:22.20]I didn't even have the camera out.
[316:25.04]And what happened there?
[316:26.94]You just walked right into my trap.
[316:29.16]What trap?
[316:29.82]I was waiting for you to land there so I could blow you up when you landed, but since you didn't land there, I had to leave the trap out so that then you just ran right over it.
[316:39.93]I couldn't pass up the opportunity.
[316:41.58]Yeah.
[316:42.82]I'm okay.
[316:43.66]I had to salvage it.
[316:50.64]It's okay.
[316:51.10]I made sure Teresa was clear of the explosion.
[316:56.32]I've got blood all... No, that's disgusting.
[316:57.88]I've got blood all over my hands.
[316:59.29]That's gross.
[317:02.11]He's healing the wounds.
[317:02.97]Alright, what do you want to do for the last, like, 30 to 40 minutes to an hour or something?
[317:12.63]Uh... Okay.
[317:13.69]Let's take a look.
[317:15.11]We gotta give ourselves an objective.
[317:16.44]I don't think we even have one.
[317:21.10]Okay, we need to figure out how to build the guerrilla garrison.
[317:24.37]Because everything fun is locked behind the guerrilla garrison.
[317:28.77]There's rocket launchers.
[317:32.11]There's bows.
[317:33.99]There's seven shotguns, four sniper rifles.
[317:37.76]Every single thing is tied to that.
[317:39.48]Okay.
[317:41.98]Do we have any indicator of where to go for that?
[317:48.74]I think it's supposed to be in the camp.
[317:50.54]But I probably already like... I don't know.
[317:54.44]What's down here?
[317:56.72]You can find them in military installations too.
[318:01.06]There's this Cortina Weather Station.
[318:02.58]Military target.
[318:05.39]Vehicle pickup points.
[318:08.79]There's this one over here, which is the tobacco factory.
[318:11.83]Military target.
[318:17.47]There's a town over here.
[318:22.56]You can't turn the stream off until you get on an airplane and try to just fly to the bad guy's HQ to kill him.
[318:30.45]Okay, we'll try that.
[318:35.77]Alex, you up for a challenge?
[318:36.65]To like just fly across to rank 8 and try to kill the guy with like a sniper headshot in the head?
[318:41.56]Fly to rank 8?
[318:44.38]just fly across okay sure where's the guy alright so hit go to your map uh-huh uh oh like the top yeah just go fly to his like compound um el presidente look he's getting a plane you're gonna drive because you're much better than I am okay fly across this this is gonna be like daisy level travel time
[319:15.25]Try it.
[319:15.59]Maybe we can fly out of bounds or something.
[319:18.32]We can fly around and land.
[319:22.40]Okay.
[319:22.88]You want to try it?
[319:25.48]I didn't mean to click that.
[319:31.89]How do we get a plane?
[319:35.13]Yeah, there's restricted airspace, but can we avoid the restricted airspace by flying around the ocean or something?
[319:47.71]I think we probably need to fast travel, which is not going to happen.
[319:50.51]What about like a jet ski?
[319:52.31]That might work.
[319:56.52]Yeah, maybe a jet ski might do it.
[319:58.44]If we go to the dock here.
[320:02.92]You actually might be onto something, seriously.
[320:04.28]If we go around the entire map here.
[320:05.66]Okay, let's go west.
[320:10.37]To that marker.
[320:11.77]I'll call in just like a regular car.
[320:13.23]Mm-hmm.
[320:18.80]and then the marker there's like a dock there could be a boat okay this is kind of stupid turn around run down this hill and slide like down down the slope and just hold wow that's fun you can almost do the entire hill okay let's go you guys are gonna stop the whole war
[320:50.49]I mean, we're gonna see what happens.
[320:52.37]It's worth a shot.
[320:53.21]Why does it always end up like this?
[321:02.78]It always ends up like this.
[321:03.64]Okay.
[321:19.51]and I'm kind of just hoping that there is a boat of some kind right yeah spike strips this car is not doing very well but nice job I just dodged the spike strips smoking a little bit though for some did we get shot I think we may have
[321:53.39]Is there a third person view?
[321:54.45]I don't think so.
[321:56.09]Only in the camp.
[322:01.55]That guy spawned and you killed him.
[322:03.09]Yeah.
[322:05.72]Okay.
[322:06.56]It just occurred to me that little Chorizo is like following us.
[322:12.14]Yeah, just running on the road.
[322:12.92]You think he can like do a wheelie on the slopes?
[322:29.69]Very nice.
[322:30.19]Oh, it's a cow.
[322:33.53]I thought that was a bison.
[322:43.59]Those windshield wipers are sure helping us right now.
[322:47.17]Keeping the smoke down.
[322:49.30]This dude flipped.
[322:51.68]Okay, I didn't realize there was a ditch.
[322:53.84]I was just trying to cut across the grass.
[323:06.99]We're almost at water.
[323:08.15]We're almost there.
[323:08.95]Uh oh.
[323:09.56]We just need to make it to the water.
[323:13.16]And oh Jesus.
[323:16.00]Uh oh.
[323:17.84]Hey, come look at me.
[323:19.38]You alright?
[323:21.13]Alright, this is your opportunity.
[323:23.41]Go to the rank 8 area and die.
[323:27.23]Thank you.
[323:30.55]This is...
[323:32.27]Your body is gone, but your arms are still there.
[323:34.09]Wait, come over here.
[323:35.87]If you swim this way... You're gonna drown.
[323:41.95]No, my head's above water right now.
[323:43.95]Is it?
[323:44.77]Yeah.
[323:46.00]I could be here as long as... Actually, there may not be a way out except drowning.
[323:49.78]I wanna help you.
[323:51.22]I can go underwater, though.
[323:52.56]But if I go underwater... There's a boat over here.
[323:59.83]Hang on, I might be able to...
[324:08.64]There's a boat right here.
[324:15.61]Hold on.
[324:17.75]What happened?
[324:21.95]I'm swimming back up.
[324:23.65]Are you dying?
[324:25.51]I got a boat.
[324:25.95]Uh oh, now I'm gonna drown.
[324:30.20]Alright, it's fine.
[324:30.68]We're gonna repair this shit.
[324:33.16]I'm just under the world!
[324:36.54]Grasping for air like a horror movie like I can see reality fourth dimensional through the bookcases I can see you in the boat having fun, and I'm like struggling to get to you Alex this boat has a machine gun Just really be very aware that whoa I think we're gonna be able to get out I think I think this is the ones actually a good boat.
[324:57.87]It's really good boat and We got to go
[325:07.37]I'm here.
[325:09.19]Okay, we're gonna try to... So you're gonna go right.
[325:14.05]We're gonna hit an invisible wall.
[325:15.87]Follow the coastline.
[325:17.55]We're gonna hit an invisible wall, I think.
[325:18.70]Am I going straight here?
[325:21.12]Self-defense.
[325:22.02]You go right outside this little opening.
[325:29.80]Does somebody just have a sailboat out here?
[325:31.28]I don't think that's a sailboat.
[325:33.06]I think they're coming to get us.
[325:34.66]Are they?
[325:34.96]The guy on the left is.
[325:37.00]The guy on the left is.
[325:39.31]You got a gun.
[325:41.43]I do.
[325:42.73]You got to go.
[325:43.69]You got to drive.
[325:44.35]I'm going.
[325:46.17]There's too much smoke.
[325:54.38]Oh, shit.
[325:55.14]There's a lot of machine Gunboats out here.
[325:57.56]There are.
[325:58.20]Yeah.
[325:58.94]This is their way to make it so you don't come over here.
[326:06.65]So how far do we need to go?
[326:09.89]Oh, I mean, you just keep going.
[326:13.16]There's almost no end in sight.
[326:14.28]If I can't look at my map, alright.
[326:18.46]Oh, Jesus.
[326:19.28]Okay.
[326:21.76]I'll set a marker for... Oh, you actually can't set markers up here.
[326:25.15]I don't think you can.
[326:25.81]No.
[326:26.53]No.
[326:30.11]It's like this is an illegal zone.
[326:33.86]We're beyond the veil at this point.
[326:35.98]As long as we can just trace the outside, I think we'll be fine.
[326:38.84]I hope they run into a destroyer and get vaporized.
[326:50.25]Hey.
[326:58.81]We're doing the... What's that RPG where you can win the game?
[327:02.83]Like, in the opening segments?
[327:04.49]Like, gothic or something?
[327:06.56]Yeah, something like that.
[327:09.10]Wait, do you just, like, sprint as fast as you can to this one town and, like, kill the guy?
[327:19.44]Alright.
[327:20.14]If we can actually kill the boss... I don't think he'll even be on the map.
[327:27.81]Do we even... Like, because we know what region he's in, but do we know, like...
[327:30.93]We know where his house is?
[327:32.63]Yeah.
[327:36.39]It's probably going to be a big building.
[327:38.33]It's probably going to be very clear.
[327:39.64]What do you think the odds are that they have something that's even better than tanks and choppers?
[327:50.04]Probably pretty high.
[327:50.78]You're about to drive A, into an island, and B, into the bad guys.
[327:55.05]Into an island?
[327:55.69]Wait a minute.
[327:56.37]I got plenty of room.
[328:00.80]I got plenty of room.
[328:01.36]I'm fine.
[328:03.88]Just confirm with me that I'm going the right way.
[328:05.80]I mean, look, the AI beached their boat.
[328:08.22]I'm just saying anything's possible.
[328:09.78]Okay?
[328:12.57]What?
[328:13.89]What?
[328:14.77]What?
[328:17.59]What are you talking about?
[328:18.59]No, get out and push.
[328:19.47]What?
[328:22.61]Just push it.
[328:22.97]We'll be fine.
[328:26.81]We can push.
[328:32.96]A little bit more.
[328:33.36]I think that's okay.
[328:39.41]I think we're good.
[328:43.45]How did you board this?
[328:44.93]From the edges.
[328:51.40]Where are we?
[328:53.26]We are actually way closer than I thought we were going to be.
[328:56.28]We're almost there.
[328:58.96]We're like halfway there, yeah.
[329:01.27]Are you gonna- are you gonna take the right and go through the little inlet?
[329:04.08]Like the little, um... Oh god, no, we're going that way.
[329:07.96]Uh, yeah, go around.
[329:08.70]Go around the tall side.
[329:10.14]Can you move?
[329:11.26]Yep.
[329:12.16]Okay, cause you're- Fucking asshole.
[329:17.83]Kill him!
[329:18.11]Kill him!
[329:18.43]Kill him!
[329:18.75]Kill him!
[329:19.07]Kill him!
[329:19.73]Kill this guy!
[329:23.73]Okay, that's good.
[329:24.97]I- I beeped at him and he fucking- whatever.
[329:31.93]Kill this guy too.
[329:32.47]Kill that guy.
[329:33.75]Nice.
[329:34.13]Good.
[329:34.85]Good work.
[329:41.99]Dude, okay.
[329:44.37]Boating accidents actually happen like that.
[329:48.53]Ow, fuck.
[329:49.65]You have so much space.
[329:51.17]You go anywhere.
[329:51.99]And you hit the only other... Like oil tanker spills.
[330:01.80]Alright, we're almost there.
[330:02.52]Look, we have to be really tactical.
[330:06.59]We have to be really stealthy, too.
[330:08.29]No bullshit.
[330:08.95]No, like, flying laugh-out-loud helicopters into the walls or whatever.
[330:12.81]No, we're going to get there and we're going to sneak to this guy's compound.
[330:14.83]And one of us is going to sniper rifle him in the head.
[330:17.37]Alright, I'm going to... I see, like, a haze on the horizon.
[330:21.80]You should probably, like, veer right a little bit so we don't hit some, like, water wall.
[330:28.54]Do they know?
[330:29.61]Dude, that guy's got a better gun.
[330:31.47]That's a better boat.
[330:33.40]How far are we?
[330:34.34]Or is it the same one?
[330:35.12]Is it the same boat?
[330:36.22]We're almost there.
[330:37.10]It's just right away.
[330:37.70]Alright, just keep going.
[330:42.57]Alright, so you guide me a little bit here because I don't know exactly where I'm going.
[330:45.77]Okay, you're going to go...
[330:50.31]Just kind of turn to the right side of that island.
[330:56.47]And just kind of follow.
[330:57.57]Like this way?
[330:58.77]Yeah, just follow that.
[330:59.58]Is it going to be an LOL laughing about it moment?
[331:06.34]Find out.
[331:15.31]So, okay.
[331:16.07]Rank is just...
[331:18.67]how hard it is relative to your equipment, I guess.
[331:21.37]I believe so.
[331:23.57]They kind of, like, turned Far Cry into an RPG.
[331:27.02]Weirdly.
[331:27.42]We're not supposed to be in this zone.
[331:30.02]Yeah, like, you have to have, okay, you have to have the right, like, level up guns, like, health bars and all that shit.
[331:41.24]Alright, so this looks like... This zone on the right here, I think, is... The zone.
[331:46.32]You think it's just that tall building?
[331:48.65]That, like, kind of cathedral-looking building right there?
[331:53.33]It actually probably is, yeah.
[331:54.97]I assume, right?
[332:01.73]One of them is, like, a huge hotel.
[332:03.83]Okay, so you watch, like, the first, like, few...
[332:11.31]Push.
[332:15.53]It's the only piece of land here.
[332:18.53]Of course it is.
[332:19.07]There's sharks everywhere, so just be aware.
[332:22.77]Oh, my God.
[332:23.21]Push it.
[332:23.59]Push it.
[332:24.01]Yeah, there's a lot.
[332:24.73]Push it.
[332:25.09]Push it.
[332:25.39]Push it.
[332:25.91]This is bad.
[332:26.53]They're closing in.
[332:30.93]Is this drivable yet?
[332:31.73]Not yet.
[332:47.21]Can you drive it?
[332:47.63]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[332:52.19]I can't get in.
[332:55.53]I can't get in.
[333:00.60]Take their boat.
[333:01.30]Take their boat.
[333:01.92]Take their- I mean, I've already shot the hel- It's sinking.
[333:04.36]No, it's not.
[333:04.84]We can repair it.
[333:06.68]There's- Those sharks are- Are everywhere.
[333:12.98]This- I mean, I think this one will drive.
[333:14.62]We can repair this one.
[333:20.47]This is a sure thing.
[333:21.43]This is absolutely a sure thing.
[333:22.51]Uh-oh.
[333:31.43]Why do I hear a dog?
[333:33.31]A dog?
[333:37.63]Uh, they're like ro- Why is a baby dog in the water paddle doing the doggy paddle?
[333:44.14]He's just in the water?
[333:45.12]Yeah, he's just in the water.
[333:55.51]Get this thing out of here.
[334:00.13]Alright.
[334:00.53]Come to my boat.
[334:01.59]It's in a good spot.
[334:05.85]I will protect you.
[334:06.59]I will make sure I shoot the sharks that come near you.
[334:15.08]Okay.
[334:15.62]I'm on your boat.
[334:16.84]Very good.
[334:17.18]Alright.
[334:20.30]Be careful.
[334:20.66]We don't want to hit the same piece of land.
[334:24.38]Very nice.
[334:24.80]Alright, good.
[334:26.24]What was that?
[334:27.60]Apparently, there is a vehicle weapon.
[334:37.21]So much smoke.
[334:39.85]Left Teresa.
[334:43.49]Are we smoking?
[334:44.17]Hold on.
[334:45.37]Are we?
[334:45.55]I have to repair this.
[334:48.45]Boat.
[334:53.85]Got it.
[334:55.75]dealt with.
[334:56.17]I can't get back on the gunner seat.
[334:58.87]Oh, wait.
[334:59.43]Come back.
[334:59.79]Come back.
[335:00.26]Come back.
[335:00.96]Come back.
[335:01.98]Come back.
[335:02.60]These sharks are going to eat me.
[335:03.84]These sharks are going to eat me.
[335:05.68]Come back.
[335:06.00]Come back.
[335:10.02]Don't kill me.
[335:11.12]Don't kill me.
[335:13.95]Okay.
[335:14.49]Holy shit.
[335:15.95]Wait.
[335:16.17]Wait.
[335:16.31]Wait.
[335:16.49]Slow down.
[335:16.89]Slow down.
[335:17.23]I need to sit down.
[335:19.39]Come here.
[335:20.81]You good?
[335:21.51]Okay.
[335:21.95]I'm good.
[335:23.23]I just road killed a shark.
[335:26.47]and we got the meat for it he's definitely in that big tower over there okay so uh once we get in here because they're like the highest level enemies in the entire game if they don't one-shot us we're just gonna no fighting like only run yeah just just try to get where just try to get where we're trying to get to
[335:57.56]That guy was on our team.
[335:59.74]How was I supposed to know that?
[336:01.18]Look, everything's a threat right now.
[336:02.60]We're trying to get to the last guy in the game.
[336:07.14]Does the water look weird to you?
[336:08.58]To the right?
[336:12.35]Kind of, yeah.
[336:12.79]No, it's just a seawall.
[336:16.39]Boat explosion?
[336:18.43]Watch out for the buoy!
[336:19.13]Watch out for the buoy!
[336:20.83]That wasn't mine.
[336:21.43]What do you mean abandoned ship?
[336:24.71]Oh, fuck.
[336:25.17]No, we're okay.
[336:26.29]Hold on.
[336:27.13]How do you, uh... Those are- those are mines.
[336:29.40]Whoa!
[336:39.18]No!
[336:41.04]What happened?
[336:41.96]You ran into a mine!
[336:44.00]Yeah, but like, uh, we were stationary.
[336:46.11]I didn't expect it to explode twice.
[336:48.43]Where's this gonna put us?
[336:49.67]Oh, no.
[336:51.39]Shit.
[336:54.81]I should have jumped.
[336:57.13]I was trying to get the other boat, the people off the other boat.
[336:59.43]Okay, what if we get on a plane and we take that same route around?
[337:04.29]That'll be faster, right?
[337:07.31]We need to get a plane that has a gun.
[337:12.33]I think the game crashed.
[337:14.87]I think we're just so far away from anywhere that it wants to spawn us that it's loading in the game again for the first time.
[337:23.31]But also, it may also bug.
[337:26.65]Yeah, but... Aww.
[337:41.50]I don't... What exploded the second time?
[337:44.49]I don't think it was a mine.
[337:45.67]I think they, like, fired an explosive round.
[337:48.01]I think the boat was on fire.
[337:51.02]Because the boat we're piloting has a grenade launcher.
[337:54.08]So if they had one of those, like, aimed at us, they could just shoot a grenade launcher.
[337:57.38]Oh, we were so close.
[338:00.04]We were so close.
[338:05.85]And also, it may have crashed.
[338:08.39]I think we're dead in the water here.
[338:10.85]Yeah.
[338:13.13]Yeah.
[338:15.61]I'll give it till it completes the circle, but that's it.
[338:17.23]And we're out.
[338:20.48]Aww.
[338:23.51]It got disconnected.
[338:28.13]Is Far Cry 6 good?
[338:29.88]No.
[338:32.06]Is Far Cry 6 worth playing?
[338:33.76]Yes.
[338:35.22]Hope that answers your question.
[338:49.19]Far Cry 6, playing it like we are right now, is an absolute blast.
[338:58.01]Does a 6 out of 10 rating still stand?
[338:59.89]Yeah.
[339:00.08]It's not a bad game.
[339:03.04]It's just more of exactly what you've played probably three or four times now.
[339:09.34]Yeah.
[339:09.80]It's fun.
[339:10.22]I seem to remember...
[339:13.04]I feel like there's maybe more stuff in this game, but there's more, like, locked stuff.
[339:17.84]Far Cry 5, I remember we streamed it twice because there was, like, more stuff to do.
[339:24.64]Yeah.
[339:24.88]I mean, granted, we are not playing the game the way that it may have been intended to be played.
[339:31.44]To be clear, I'm at, like, stream shit.
[339:34.10]Yeah, yeah.
[339:37.36]Alright.
[339:38.06]Do you want to try the playing strategy once?
[339:40.20]See if it works.
[339:40.62]Yeah.
[339:41.76]It's up to you.
[339:42.76]Yeah.
[339:43.10]Let's try playing strat one time.
[339:45.60]Worth a shot.
[339:49.34]I'm loading back in here.
[339:56.69]It's definitely fun.
[339:59.07]Like, not every game that comes out has to be, like, a masterpiece.
[340:05.07]It's just fun to play.
[340:06.29]It's not, I mean, it's good, I guess, kind of.
[340:11.84]Really pretty looking game.
[340:13.90]Seems to be well acted.
[340:16.24]But, you kind of, it would just, you're just playing the same game you've already played.
[340:21.63]Just kind of more stuff to do.
[340:24.85]Since what, since like Far Cry 4, right?
[340:27.39]It's sort of, every Far Cry has been like a DLC for Far Cry 4.
[340:30.75]Is that accurate?
[340:32.59]Yeah, pretty much.
[340:37.91]There's only so much new stuff you can add once you've got like helicopters, planes, jet skis, boats with guns on them, boats with grenade launchers on them.
[340:51.13]You got a black screen?
[340:51.86]Yeah, it's Aladdin.
[340:54.66]What is this warm up PSO cache thing?
[340:57.82]I've never seen that before.
[341:06.32]Alright, we're going to try the playing strat.
[341:08.12]Let's see what happens.
[341:17.66]What was the one you play, what, Far Cry Primal?
[341:22.04]Yeah, that was like the... That was the one with the dinosaurs and the mammoths.
[341:31.16]I wonder if that one's fun.
[341:32.56]I never played it.
[341:32.96]Alright, I'm ready for an invite.
[341:34.68]Okay.
[341:41.31]I'm currently connecting to the Far Cry servers.
[341:44.26]Please wait.
[341:44.86]How do you feel about Sora being in Smash?
[341:51.31]What are your thoughts?
[341:51.87]What are my thoughts on Sora being in Smash?
[341:59.88]Well, where to begin?
[342:02.59]First, I need to go ahead and show you guys the prologue.
[342:05.11]This is the lore for Kingdom Hearts 1, and I'm trying to figure out how to canonically connect the Sora in Smash Bros.
[342:10.71]with the other 17 Kingdom Hearts games.
[342:13.23]So if you guys would all just go ahead and sit down, get a snack, pay attention.
[342:16.31]We're going to watch all the lore videos for all the Kingdom Hearts games, back-to-back, in order to understand why Sakurai decided to do this and go ahead and extend the Kingdom Hearts lore into the Smash universe, thereby...
[342:28.50]putting every single smash character potentially in the next kingdom hearts game you say can I have an invite yeah I already sent you one let's see it what the heck that was pretty good uh explainer it says I don't have one from you it said I don't have a I don't have one I sent another one got it um
[342:56.17]One of the things that I heard or that I was looking at is that Sora has been, they wanted to put him in the game like a year or two ago.
[343:03.34]Right?
[343:03.94]But like, it took like three years of like lawyers all yelling at each other before they finally agreed to put him in the game or something.
[343:11.66]Because I was confused.
[343:12.34]Okay, if you're going to have Banjo-Kazooie, don't you think you want Banjo-Kazooie to be the last character?
[343:18.33]And then, why wouldn't Sora have come out during when Kingdom Hearts 3 was relevant?
[343:22.19]You want to know the real reason?
[343:23.57]The real reason is because, coincidentally, Sora is announced for Smash the same time that the Kingdom Hearts games are announced to be coming to Nintendo platforms.
[343:33.16]And there it is.
[343:34.02]And there it is.
[343:34.46]He's got it.
[343:34.78]There it is.
[343:36.50]You found the smoking gun.
[343:39.36]It's just a brand deal.
[343:40.69]Like, Nintendo doesn't give a shit who the last character is.
[343:43.09]They were just like, what major franchise can we bring to Switch?
[343:45.93]Because people are complaining there's not enough third-party games on our platform.
[343:48.37]And they're just playing Pokémon Snap for like 30 minutes and then putting the Switch down.
[343:52.47]Like, I don't understand.
[343:53.57]There it is.
[343:54.21]He's got it.
[343:54.53]We're going to get some long-ass games that will take 150 hours for gamers to complete and sell it in a big bundle so they can buy the bundle.
[343:59.89]And I guess we'll get a new character in Smash at the same time.
[344:02.14]There it is.
[344:03.54]Nailing it.
[344:04.54]There it is.
[344:09.56]Okay, let's go to the plane joke.
[344:22.97]Where is the plane joke from here?
[344:32.54]I was looking for the craft image.
[344:33.98]There it is.
[344:34.44]Okay, I got an idea.
[344:38.87]What if we both take a plane?
[344:40.21]That way if one of us crashes, the other one's alive.
[344:42.37]That's brilliant.
[344:45.51]I wonder if we can summon two at once.
[344:47.30]I'll have to say close.
[344:48.88]Yeah, because I'm going to port into yours and then my plane's going to explode.
[344:52.58]Okay, so you just drive like a few feet down the runway.
[344:59.27]You go first.
[345:01.25]I'm just going to be honest.
[345:02.29]I need to follow you, not the other way around.
[345:05.99]Trust me on this one.
[345:08.05]Okay, I'm just going to set like a marker.
[345:09.67]A helicopter is probably better, right?
[345:11.17]No, but plane... But it's slow.
[345:12.97]It is slow.
[345:13.43]You're right.
[345:13.85]Okay.
[345:17.34]What happens if you call for two planes?
[345:21.78]Just says ride cannot be delivered.
[345:23.34]Let's see if we can even spawn two planes in.
[345:26.06]Well, how about this?
[345:26.90]You just go.
[345:28.52]I'll try to spawn one.
[345:29.37]It's going to teleport me into your plane anyways.
[345:34.25]Oh, that should be fine.
[345:40.60]Vehicle currently in use.
[345:42.18]So, no, just go.
[345:43.28]So, just me?
[345:44.44]Just you.
[345:45.82]Are you in?
[345:47.22]If you fly, I'll just be teleported to the backseat.
[345:54.42]Why are things exploding on the side?
[345:56.20]You ran over, oh, I got 15 trees.
[345:58.42]Oh, what?
[346:00.02]I got you with that?
[346:00.96]No, I didn't.
[346:01.52]I did not hit you with that, did I?
[346:07.56]No way.
[346:16.11]I can't believe that hit you.
[346:18.59]Okay.
[346:19.05]Um, just fly away.
[346:21.48]Fly.
[346:21.92]Are you in or not?
[346:24.10]No, not yet.
[346:24.76]I'm just, I can still see you.
[346:33.04]Now I'm in.
[346:33.48]Okay.
[346:35.68]Theoretically here, if you go to the ocean, maybe the right, should we go fly to the ocean?
[346:40.17]If you, if you fly straight ahead from here, just fly straight.
[346:45.89]Oh, hang on.
[346:46.87]Oh, wait, I'm looking at the wrong person here.
[346:48.15]Yeah, you're gonna turn around, fly towards the ocean.
[346:51.15]You will not hit any... I'm running out of room here.
[346:54.67]We're about to be in some very heavily restricted airspace.
[346:57.55]I'm gonna fly over this mountain.
[346:59.26]There are places where we can fly.
[347:01.86]It's just the entire zone that he's in, we cannot.
[347:09.64]Do you like your, uh... Oh.
[347:11.84]He's flying north.
[347:13.58]Why are we upside down?
[347:17.15]uh to try to get out of restricted airspace I am okay I need to go west or what which direction I need to go so you need to go north fly north and north is the restricted airspace though is it
[347:37.65]Okay, both of our curses are on top of each other, and I can't tell who's pointing who.
[347:42.91]Okay, no, turn right, turn right.
[347:44.61]If you pull right and just kind of- I'm already committed.
[347:46.99]What are you talking about you're already committed?
[347:49.37]I'm already in.
[347:49.89]What are you doing?
[347:51.11]No, don't be in!
[347:52.71]What are you doing?
[347:53.57]Don't be in!
[347:54.11]We're going down.
[348:05.02]I fucking just pressed E.
[348:10.70]What just hit you?
[348:15.54]I'm still alive.
[348:19.22]Alright, it didn't work.
[348:20.20]Whatever.
[348:20.56]Is that you sniping at me?
[348:27.96]Dipper meant for himself now.
[348:33.88]I keep pushing this button.
[348:42.61]Okay, look, it's fine.
[348:43.85]We actually are almost halfway there.
[348:46.49]No.
[348:47.63]We're almost halfway there.
[348:53.03]Hold on.
[348:53.31]I got an idea.
[348:57.95]This helicopter is just chasing me.
[348:59.43]It's okay.
[349:00.75]You're going to come to me.
[349:02.01]I'm trying to come to you without being killed.
[349:06.57]I'm coming.
[349:08.53]You will.
[349:10.64]Spawn me into your car.
[349:13.32]Okay, I'm coming.
[349:16.34]I don't think... Are you just... Are you gonna try to just drive there on the road?
[349:19.32]I'm gonna GTA strat.
[349:20.28]We're gonna go to, uh... We're gonna go to the airfield and then steal a vehicle from the airfield.
[349:32.31]It's... It is right there.
[349:35.69]I told you we're not... We're really not that far.
[349:38.07]No, we're really not.
[349:41.79]God, I hope I can just throw a grenade in his room.
[349:45.16]Oh, that didn't work out apparently.
[349:54.90]Gotta go around the spikes.
[349:59.37]We're alright.
[350:02.45]We're in rank seven.
[350:05.47]Why do we have people behind us?
[350:06.59]Hey, it's alright.
[350:07.31]What rank are we?
[350:07.97]We're gonna get like triple experience.
[350:11.85]Oh, double XP weakened in Far Cry 6?
[350:14.11]Pretty much what we're doing.
[350:16.88]Right click on Etalyx' head, then left click.
[350:18.80]Oh, I wonder what that does.
[350:26.86]Okay, before we dive, do you actually, is there a plane available in this vicinity?
[350:33.62]Um, I didn't mean to shoot.
[350:35.80]I don't know.
[350:36.28]That's a very good question.
[350:37.10]You just alerted everyone.
[350:38.85]I alerted the pigs, oh no.
[350:40.93]Oh, was that?
[350:49.13]I mean, if there's going to be a plane, there, it's this one right there.
[350:53.07]There is in fact a plane here.
[350:54.18]Straight ahead.
[351:00.77]Move.
[351:01.03]Uh-oh.
[351:01.75]Guard.
[351:02.27]Hang on.
[351:02.51]I gotta take him out.
[351:05.17]Okay.
[351:07.17]Let's go!
[351:13.85]This one has a machine gun on it.
[351:15.09]Why wasn't he dying?
[351:21.31]Oh, there is a machine gun on this one.
[351:26.80]Okay.
[351:27.84]I mean, I did crash the last plane, so I can't really talk.
[351:30.74]How do you fly the plane?
[351:31.40]Quick, tell me.
[351:31.78]How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly?
[351:40.61]Okay.
[351:41.83]Now, Mouse, just head to the ocean.
[351:43.27]Ocean, fast.
[351:47.57]We're about to get...
[351:53.94]No!
[351:54.80]Sorry, get a boat, get a boat, get a boat, get a boat!
[351:57.28]I'm done, fucking I'm done.
[351:58.64]I'm still alive.
[351:59.58]You are?
[351:59.90]I'm alive.
[352:01.10]I have one HP.
[352:02.18]Okay, wait, stay alive.
[352:03.02]I'm gonna spawn on you in a second.
[352:03.96]I'm on you.
[352:05.94]Alright, we need a boat.
[352:08.32]It's right there, dude.
[352:11.00]Alright, we have to overwhelm the fuck out of somebody over here.
[352:15.04]Boat?
[352:15.92]Boat.
[352:16.12]We gotta go to the same boat.
[352:17.14]We have to overwhelm whoever's on it.
[352:18.40]Because there's gonna be people with machine guns and stuff.
[352:22.57]Is this boat on fire?
[352:24.51]I think so.
[352:25.69]Shark.
[352:26.13]Oh, God.
[352:26.83]Oh, shit.
[352:29.81]They hit the boat really hard.
[352:36.47]I will take... I'm just bait right now.
[352:39.21]I have two of them, three of them on me right now.
[352:41.11]There's more.
[352:43.77]I can't heal in here.
[352:45.15]Just stay alive.
[352:45.69]I'm going to try to bait all of them.
[352:47.29]Okay.
[352:47.45]I'm going to get to this boat.
[352:49.42]I just got killed.
[352:50.42]They're on you.
[352:52.59]I made it to the fiery boat?
[352:54.68]Excellent.
[352:56.94]Currently repairing?
[352:58.62]Excellent.
[353:00.20]Oh, excellent.
[353:05.02]Oh, no dinner today, huh?
[353:06.58]Get out of here.
[353:10.06]What the fuck is going on?
[353:11.27]Okay.
[353:19.31]Is it repaired?
[353:22.71]I'm gonna drive.
[353:23.17]We gotta go.
[353:23.47]Is there a guy in the water?
[353:24.61]I think there is.
[353:25.13]Fuck him.
[353:25.39]Who cares?
[353:28.90]Alright.
[353:30.44]Perfect.
[353:30.82]This is exactly where we were last time.
[353:32.60]We just have to get over here.
[353:35.58]Uh, can you stop for a sec so I can get in the gunner?
[353:37.08]Oh.
[353:38.40]Alright, you go.
[353:40.11]Alright, there are mines here we have to be aware of.
[353:49.16]Going for that building over there.
[353:50.80]Did that boat just appear?
[353:52.24]It did.
[353:52.40]They don't want us out here.
[353:56.97]So I'm thinking once I get in here, I'm going to take a right.
[354:03.03]Let's see.
[354:03.83]We could like... You should be able to see them.
[354:10.12]They're like floating in the water.
[354:13.22]So should I bang, should I go right?
[354:14.64]Just bang it right here and we'll go in there?
[354:16.74]Or should I wrap around further?
[354:17.72]Because I feel like it's right there.
[354:18.82]That's his like big hideout or something, right?
[354:21.02]Yeah, like we exploded just in front of this.
[354:23.47]Head towards the seawall to the right.
[354:24.67]Alright, I see the mines.
[354:27.57]Oh, there you go, yeah.
[354:28.55]The big, big red bubbles.
[354:32.13]Can I shoot him?
[354:35.35]I would, we are alerting people to our presence.
[354:38.87]Okay, so if we get up here.
[354:42.45]See this spot right here?
[354:46.61]Right where the wall is?
[354:52.24]Clearing a path.
[354:55.26]The question is, how far in is this place?
[354:59.41]From where we are right now.
[355:02.59]Should we jump over here and just kind of start to sneak into the house?
[355:06.39]We're going to have to go through the whole city.
[355:08.79]What about, is there a better place to be?
[355:10.33]Extremely restrictive.
[355:10.95]If you attempt to fly into it, you'll be shot down and die immediately.
[355:13.57]But we're not flying it.
[355:15.99]What, are we going for this building, like?
[355:18.09]I would say the big one, yeah.
[355:20.30]Like the one with the red, the red light at the top.
[355:22.18]Yeah.
[355:25.20]I feel like that.
[355:25.82]Isn't that the hotel?
[355:28.52]Or is that his, like, actual hideout?
[355:30.85]Well, he's got, we got... Square...
[355:36.96]This park.
[355:38.40]Torre del Leon.
[355:44.97]Where are the spoilers in chat?
[355:47.09]Well, we have to get out of here anyways, so let's just get out.
[355:50.73]We can't take the boat over here.
[355:52.17]It's a mansion.
[355:59.36]Okay, this is probably the good time to actually change to usable guns.
[356:02.78]Torre del Leon is the hideout.
[356:07.23]So, we need to go... Where was that?
[356:12.41]Okay.
[356:13.25]We have... Whatever.
[356:16.65]It's marked.
[356:17.03]We have to be very careful.
[356:24.16]Okay.
[356:28.22]I'm just changing loadout.
[356:32.30]There's a car right here.
[356:37.37]Looks like there's nobody around.
[356:38.37]Is that, is that, uh... Is that gonna be... Is that a car?
[356:52.51]Should we put all our eggs... I feel like we should... Not split up?
[356:56.61]Yeah, like not split up, but like... Be separated, I see what you mean.
[357:00.37]The respawn points are too valuable.
[357:04.29]I'm gonna slowly just kinda start moving around.
[357:08.47]Avoid all the red gas shit.
[357:10.55]That's enemy stuff.
[357:13.76]Yeah, there's a lot of enemies down there.
[357:16.02]Honestly, I would just get in the car for now because there's no enemies down here.
[357:18.14]Hold on, hold on.
[357:19.12]I'm almost away from their suspicion.
[357:22.16]There we go.
[357:23.22]Okay.
[357:25.18]Yeah, I would just get in the car right now until we find a new car.
[357:27.35]Because in the event that you do get detected, we can just get out of here.
[357:32.13]Alright, let's do it.
[357:40.79]I'm just avoiding all the red circles.
[357:44.40]Dead ahead.
[357:49.64]And the houses too.
[357:53.18]What does this feel like dying light?
[357:55.04]Oh, wait for the car to pass.
[358:01.79]We're just like running over shit.
[358:06.83]Okay, we can go this way now.
[358:12.28]It's a roadblock up ahead.
[358:13.52]There is, but there's nobody here.
[358:14.32]I think they're in the guard tower.
[358:17.98]Oh, fuck.
[358:18.58]How are we going to get through this?
[358:23.37]I think it's very purpose-built to not allow this.
[358:26.65]I think we're going to have to go on foot, to be honest.
[358:28.41]Alright, let's sneak.
[358:31.78]Just holster your gun.
[358:33.04]Maybe it'll buy us more time.
[358:34.72]Yeah, go for stab kills.
[358:42.69]Which way are you going?
[358:44.43]Uh, I just think there's... These are like restricted areas.
[358:48.49]Are there planes around here?
[358:49.74]Is there one to the blue marker?
[358:51.68]No, no, no.
[358:52.50]The white one.
[358:52.92]Can you make it again?
[358:59.10]Uh, yeah.
[358:59.34]The one I'm looking at is this one here.
[359:01.45]Toro de Leon is where he is.
[359:03.49]Oh, it's blue for me.
[359:04.59]Never mind.
[359:04.93]Oh, okay.
[359:09.96]What is that?
[359:10.64]Is that a stork?
[359:11.70]Can I feed the stork?
[359:18.18]I thought the stork made that noise.
[359:21.93]It's like the period just ended in like a hockey game.
[359:29.61]Pelican.
[359:30.47]Alright, let's go this way.
[359:34.20]Hang on, hang on.
[359:34.82]We have a silenced gun, but it probably does no damage to level 8 enemies.
[359:39.00]No, we're only going to be able to stealth kill these guys.
[359:42.14]Alright, there's a scary guy there.
[359:48.76]No, that's a dog.
[359:51.28]It's a dog and a scary guy.
[359:53.94]What about this way?
[359:59.36]Good idea.
[360:02.18]Nice and slow.
[360:02.66]Take it easy.
[360:04.50]We're not in a rush.
[360:17.07]We are literally dead on site now.
[360:19.77]This is actually... This gameplay right here is kind of what Deathloop is.
[360:24.63]Sort of.
[360:28.67]You alright?
[360:29.73]Yeah, we're good.
[360:30.73]Nobody's here.
[360:32.25]Are we good?
[360:32.69]Can we?
[360:33.23]Yeah.
[360:34.01]Yeah.
[360:34.57]We're good.
[360:35.13]Does it hurt?
[360:38.07]Ow!
[360:39.63]Fuck, that hurts.
[360:46.25]There's a crafting table here.
[360:47.78]I think those are good guys on the right.
[360:51.66]Are they?
[360:53.96]New fast travel open!
[360:57.50]Oh, dude.
[360:59.12]Oh, dude.
[361:00.16]There's no way the dude is here.
[361:02.35]Oh, he's here.
[361:02.91]Oh, he listened to my voice.
[361:04.13]Did you hear that?
[361:05.41]I want to be able to shoot him in the head once and kill him.
[361:20.88]Oh, that's definitely not going to happen.
[361:22.50]Silencer.
[361:26.83]Slightly reduced.
[361:29.43]Weapon noise.
[361:35.41]No, that's getting... No, no, no.
[361:37.23]No, I don't want range.
[361:37.99]I don't want to do that.
[361:41.05]Maybe I do.
[361:44.27]Optical socket.
[361:44.89]Okay, I want... I haven't unlocked any others.
[361:49.28]Armor piercing.
[361:50.14]Okay, I've got a decent weapon with a silencer now.
[361:59.42]Can I do armor piercing without... No, I can't.
[362:01.32]It's locked.
[362:02.38]Item missing.
[362:11.42]Alright, what other weapons can we do here?
[362:13.18]That's the sniper.
[362:16.10]I mean, there's also the theory that, I mean, if we can just run in this front door and just hold the fucking fire thing down.
[362:22.33]Like, just WM1 Pyro.
[362:24.57]His house.
[362:26.15]It's possible.
[362:27.61]Yeah, you could go flamethrower.
[362:30.53]Just, if you're gonna do flamethrower, put the, like, fire gloves on so you don't burn yourself.
[362:34.97]Yeah.
[362:35.13]Alright, I'm gonna put flamethrower on.
[362:44.03]And I'm going to put this new gun on, too.
[362:47.19]How do you unlock new utility, like, throwballs?
[362:49.55]Because there's, like, grenades and stuff.
[362:51.77]That's a great question.
[362:53.41]Okay, I've got level three Captain America shield.
[362:58.41]What you're seeing is democracy absolute.
[363:15.71]Oh, that's a good headlock there, sir.
[363:18.01]You know your judo well.
[363:21.95]Get your hand off of my... Classic.
[363:25.84]Okay, they're on this road.
[363:28.06]His voice is getting louder.
[363:29.28]He's on the mic right now.
[363:30.42]He is.
[363:46.62]Okay, what about if we go down this alley this way over here?
[363:53.44]What is the charm?
[363:54.28]A meal?
[363:55.55]A succulent Chinese meal?
[363:58.61]Ta-ta and farewell.
[364:08.09]We can use the grapple too.
[364:11.30]on is there is there a grapple point I I mean there probably is oh there is a grapple point I can't see it from here god damn it I keep thinking that like they've seen us yeah that's like oh you've been spotted why why be careful be careful be careful why oh it's the grapple from below oh okay
[364:43.94]It's fine.
[364:44.50]There's nobody down here.
[364:46.22]Alright, but there's like a perfectly cut scream clip, possibly.
[364:49.64]It has to be cut at the exact right moment.
[364:53.30]What is the charge?
[364:54.22]There's people to the left here.
[365:03.45]I'm thinking down this alleyway.
[365:07.87]Oh, what happened?
[365:08.93]What happened to you?
[365:09.67]Are you alright?
[365:11.32]Yeah, I'm good.
[365:12.28]How did you...
[365:19.59]I thought that was a guy's head.
[365:24.25]Getting closer.
[365:24.79]Alright, easy.
[365:27.77]There's a dog over here!
[365:32.03]There's a dog!
[365:32.43]There's a dog!
[365:32.79]There's a dog!
[365:33.07]What do we do?
[365:34.15]Run.
[365:35.17]Where do we go?
[365:36.65]This way.
[365:41.09]Oh, shit.
[365:42.87]We just gotta start lighting people out, I think.
[365:44.51]I think that's probably a better way to go, though, don't you think?
[365:49.79]That person has an RPG.
[365:51.07]No, they don't.
[365:52.01]Okay, we're getting rid of these people.
[365:53.03]We're just going to run to his house.
[365:57.01]Run to his house.
[366:00.03]They do have an RPG.
[366:05.84]Holy shit!
[366:07.00]He hit me in the face with the RPG.
[366:10.96]Oh, he hit me again.
[366:11.62]Oh, my God.
[366:15.04]Oh, my God.
[366:16.68]Oh, my God.
[366:17.88]I'm going to hide in the corner.
[366:25.26]Alright, I got mine taken care of.
[366:28.38]Down that hallway, straight in front of you, down that alleyway, there's two people with rocket launchers.
[366:35.38]Alright, I'm going to avoid them.
[366:41.82]Get my heal back.
[366:43.82]I don't think they could possibly know where I am.
[366:47.34]I wonder, can I get the rocket launcher from that guy if I kill him?
[366:52.84]I wonder if I can get him.
[367:02.85]Yep.
[367:03.73]Oh, you need help?
[367:04.41]He has a- Oh my god, the guy sent his dog at me!
[367:08.15]The fuck, I need help!
[367:11.22]I'm sorry, dog.
[367:12.44]I'm so sorry.
[367:13.34]Nice.
[367:22.04]Do they have rocket launchers?
[367:25.62]That guy, uh, very tanky.
[367:28.56]We've got to shoot in the head.
[367:30.39]That's very important.
[367:31.47]Watch out.
[367:31.75]I don't know what that guy is.
[367:32.61]Got him.
[367:35.47]Alright, helicopter.
[367:36.97]We've got to hide from the chopper.
[367:38.71]Where is it?
[367:39.95]Oh, shit.
[367:40.41]Uh-oh.
[367:44.11]More guards.
[367:45.23]Where are they?
[367:45.61]Yep.
[367:45.77]I'm going to retreat back.
[367:47.11]Turn back.
[367:49.58]He's dead.
[367:50.66]Oh.
[367:51.76]The chopper is what scares me.
[368:00.47]Dead?
[368:01.41]Is he dead?
[368:01.97]Alright, let's go.
[368:07.62]Oceans -2.
[368:13.96]Oh, shit.
[368:14.42]We're getting close, man.
[368:17.14]We are getting close.
[368:18.06]What's going to happen when we get there?
[368:19.70]I don't know.
[368:21.13]I'm going to run over the flamethrower and hold it down.
[368:32.85]As long as... Look, just me and you are the last people.
[368:35.97]There's two other people that are left in PUBG.
[368:38.32]It's you and me.
[368:39.26]Just play like your life depends on it.
[368:41.74]Okay, they're across the street.
[368:43.76]Someone's over there that can see us.
[368:46.22]Okay, let me... Can I snipe them?
[368:47.64]Do I even have my sniper?
[368:48.74]Very important.
[368:49.24]Are we playing PUBG PC or mobile?
[368:52.15]Oh.
[368:53.21]Yeah, there's a guy right there.
[368:54.39]I think I can get him.
[368:54.95]Got him.
[368:55.23]He's dead.
[368:56.05]I shot him in the head.
[369:02.72]I keep hitting them.
[369:10.12]There's a lot of people on this street.
[369:11.22]Sorry.
[369:12.53]Just left for dead.
[369:14.47]Left for dead.
[369:16.13]Bathroom.
[369:17.79]Until they leave us alone.
[369:20.37]This guy just ziplined.
[369:32.40]I guess not.
[369:33.38]Fuck.
[369:34.02]Oh shit.
[369:34.98]Oh fuck.
[369:35.82]Oh fuck.
[369:43.55]How am I not hitting this guy?
[369:44.47]I'm gonna stealth kill the mortar guy.
[370:03.50]Oh, wow.
[370:06.36]I can't help you.
[370:07.10]I have zero health.
[370:10.08]There's one guy down here.
[370:13.00]Alright.
[370:13.50]You just stay alive because I have zero HP.
[370:15.49]Okay.
[370:18.45]I'm healing.
[370:18.77]I don't know who can see me.
[370:20.35]Somebody can see me.
[370:25.61]Alright.
[370:25.95]I got my health back, my heal back.
[370:27.43]Let's see if I can pop this guy.
[370:29.42]I have no bullets in this gun.
[370:30.88]What the hell are you doing, Jeremy?
[370:36.30]Oh, shit.
[370:36.76]We need ammo.
[370:43.06]He's focusing on you.
[370:44.85]Alright.
[370:45.75]They almost got me.
[370:47.19]I'm alive down here.
[370:47.87]If you need to die, go for it.
[370:49.13]Alright.
[370:49.75]Alright.
[370:50.05]I'm in cover.
[370:52.91]I'm sorry, doggy.
[370:55.03]I'm sorry.
[370:58.39]I have to get ammo.
[371:02.94]I guess I'm... Oh, they got pistol ammo.
[371:04.90]You should... Give me a break.
[371:14.97]Alright, I think we have to run.
[371:15.82]This is totally walled off over here.
[371:17.70]Is it?
[371:20.00]Shit.
[371:20.26]What about down this way?
[371:22.06]Ow!
[371:24.16]Oh, I'm down.
[371:26.02]That hurt.
[371:31.09]I'm just gonna die so I can spawn on top with you.
[371:33.03]Okay.
[371:36.65]Just stay in a safe place.
[371:42.40]I feel pretty safe here.
[371:47.07]I gotta switch weapons.
[371:51.17]I'm about to spawn on you in like 10 seconds.
[371:52.71]Okay.
[372:00.30]Rank up to stand up to stronger soldiers.
[372:02.06]That's fine.
[372:02.38]Alright, I'm coming on you.
[372:05.14]Here we are.
[372:06.22]I need to change weapons.
[372:09.70]Don't stand up, by the way.
[372:10.94]If you stand up as a guy to the north, they may have seen...
[372:17.72]But I don't know if they can get up here.
[372:23.17]Somebody can see us when we stand, yeah.
[372:28.47]Dead.
[372:29.41]352 this way.
[372:29.85]Alright.
[372:30.13]We're just going to keep going this way.
[372:31.93]Reloading.
[372:32.45]Watch my back.
[372:35.49]Yeah, but that way is a super wall.
[372:37.69]Is it super walled completely?
[372:39.03]What if we go to the left?
[372:39.77]You might be able to parachute over it.
[372:42.17]You think so?
[372:43.51]Like getting on top of this.
[372:46.31]This is a bad place for- Yeah, we definitely need to get over there from here.
[372:48.81]On the roof.
[372:49.11]We gotta move, we gotta move, we gotta move, we gotta move!
[372:51.51]FUCK!
[372:52.37]The parachute didn't go off!
[372:53.51]No, don't jump!
[372:54.33]Don't jump!
[372:55.37]Don't jump!
[372:56.11]Wait, what?
[372:58.09]Did we both die?
[372:58.83]It wasn't high enough to deploy the parachute.
[373:09.14]Oh, come on.
[373:15.94]That was a classic fall joke.
[373:19.98]We got a fast travel point though, didn't we?
[373:21.66]Let's see if it works.
[373:28.97]Yeah, apparently.
[373:35.97]I can't believe we both didn't get the parachutes up.
[373:38.29]I think it was just too high but too low.
[373:42.17]Too high to live, too low to parachute.
[373:47.05]Alright, let's go.
[373:51.36]I didn't even see Chorizo the entire time.
[373:53.52]Somebody said you might be able to wingsuit.
[373:56.26]We have to go to like a re... Well, I might be able to and then pull you in.
[373:59.46]Yeah, dude, what if we just... Okay, hold on.
[374:01.68]Hear me out here.
[374:03.30]Let's go all the way up to the top of this building and then you just wingsuit and fly over there.
[374:11.34]Nobody sees us.
[374:17.28]Okay, I can't hurt these guys at all.
[374:19.48]We need armor-piercing bullets.
[374:26.27]Oh, shit.
[374:27.03]Oh, shit.
[374:29.47]I have soft ammo on.
[374:30.77]Soft ammo.
[374:46.04]I need the other gun, but I don't have time to switch to it.
[374:49.48]Oh, that was you.
[374:50.46]Shit.
[374:53.54]That was me.
[374:55.06]I can't even.
[374:57.65]No, not the dog.
[374:58.83]No, not the dog.
[375:00.85]Bird, motherfucker.
[375:01.91]How dare you?
[375:02.83]No, stop.
[375:03.59]Chorizo.
[375:06.25]Chorizo.
[375:06.97]Oh, sorry, Chorizo.
[375:08.77]It's okay.
[375:09.61]Chorizo.
[375:20.47]Okay.
[375:21.27]I need to... Hold on.
[375:22.19]Let me change my ammo.
[375:25.51]Do it at the... Can you do it at the bench?
[375:27.69]This thing sucks.
[375:31.28]Give me this thing.
[375:33.66]And I want to change the ammo on it.
[375:37.90]Armor piercing's on it.
[375:39.20]That's good.
[375:39.66]I got to put armor piercing on this thing, too.
[375:48.08]There's no ammo on this thing.
[375:52.75]I think you unlock more at the workbench.
[375:56.33]Is that you?
[375:57.91]What?
[375:58.13]I'm at the workbench.
[376:01.63]Oh, there we go.
[376:02.21]There's a guy.
[376:02.79]Okay.
[376:05.25]Just put armor piercing on every gun.
[376:07.77]Yeah.
[376:08.19]You don't have to be at the workbench.
[376:10.03]You can do it anywhere.
[376:10.93]Yeah, you can do it anywhere.
[376:16.32]Okay.
[376:18.66]One mod available to install at workbench.
[376:21.44]Oh, come on.
[376:30.46]Okay.
[376:32.22]Here we go.
[376:32.58]Do you put armor piercing on your flamethrower?
[376:37.78]I can't switch it out.
[376:38.70]I don't think I have it.
[376:40.34]You have to be at a workbench.
[376:43.90]Oh, wait.
[376:44.20]Because it's just fire.
[376:46.75]Oh, what the fuck?
[376:48.03]Why?
[376:49.71]Alright.
[376:50.19]So, hey, look.
[376:52.13]See that grapple point over there?
[376:55.09]We need to get on top of this building that's high enough for you to wingsuit across the town.
[376:58.97]Uh-huh.
[377:01.12]But you can't die, though.
[377:02.94]Can you safely land the wingsuit somehow?
[377:05.36]Parachute.
[377:15.56]Okay.
[377:16.56]We have to get higher.
[377:17.94]Yeah, we actually do need to get higher.
[377:20.68]Hold on.
[377:21.02]I got an idea.
[377:21.56]There's a workbench right there.
[377:28.98]Yeah, I know.
[377:29.86]It's too late, though.
[377:32.83]Are you gonna try to, like, worms ninja rope up to another platform?
[377:38.11]Yeah, but I can't, I can't, like... I need more, I need more slack.
[377:43.36]You're gonna hit the wall.
[377:46.46]I'm slowing down.
[377:52.79]Uh, I see.
[377:53.13]You're gonna try to go up here.
[377:53.97]Oops.
[377:58.61]You actually might be able to do this if you can grab on top of where that moss is.
[378:07.75]This is difficult, and it's not going anywhere.
[378:10.51]I need more space.
[378:14.53]Okay, is that- is the person throwing grenades up here?
[378:16.73]Alright.
[378:27.42]We gotta get across the- let's go across the street.
[378:29.94]Okay, you first.
[378:33.32]Etalyx, we don't have parachutes.
[378:35.60]That's why.
[378:36.46]That's what's going on.
[378:37.12]We don't have parachutes.
[378:39.82]It's grayed out.
[378:42.28]It's not that we're not deploying them fast enough or it's too low or too high.
[378:44.92]We don't have them.
[378:46.64]Maybe I don't have a wingsuit either.
[378:59.83]Okay, so there's another tall building that we can climb.
[379:08.35]You lead.
[379:09.07]You're the one that has the suit.
[379:10.35]Hopefully you still have it.
[379:11.65]Do I have the suit?
[379:12.93]I don't know.
[379:13.47]We'll find out.
[379:20.23]Oh, back.
[379:20.80]Turn around.
[379:21.64]No.
[379:22.96]Bad.
[379:23.96]Wait, are you alive?
[379:24.82]Yeah, oh yeah.
[379:28.08]Who's this then?
[379:28.60]Is that my dog?
[379:32.50]All the way back there?
[379:33.56]I think so.
[379:37.28]Yeah, there's like four or five guards on the street.
[379:41.72]Okay.
[379:49.17]Alright.
[379:53.97]I see.
[379:54.33]Yep.
[379:54.65]We got to take these guys out.
[379:55.51]Okay.
[379:58.19]Alright.
[379:59.11]You stay up there then.
[380:07.72]That guy's got a lot of armor.
[380:09.88]Do you think a human body can block a rocket launcher?
[380:12.08]Behind you.
[380:12.40]Behind you.
[380:12.70]Behind you.
[380:12.98]Behind you.
[380:13.28]Behind you.
[380:15.58]Behind you.
[380:15.88]Behind you.
[380:16.16]Behind you.
[380:18.06]I'm trying to shoot him.
[380:18.99]I'm trying.
[380:20.31]I'm going to hit you in the head.
[380:21.45]Okay.
[380:22.73]Is that it?
[380:27.29]I think that's it on this street.
[380:28.95]Helicopter coming in.
[380:33.23]Dropper is here.
[380:38.53]Oh, we got impact slacks.
[380:42.36]I feel like those are probably good.
[380:43.10]Those are like high level gear.
[380:44.88]Where are you?
[380:46.46]Over here.
[380:47.12]In the building.
[380:52.91]A helicopter's here now.
[380:53.65]There's a lot of attention coming this way.
[380:55.09]Yeah, there is.
[380:56.09]Alright, what if we go...
[381:07.73]I'm really sorry.
[381:08.68]I'm sorry.
[381:09.06]We have to... We need clear road.
[381:13.08]I don't think it... Does the chopper know where we are?
[381:15.54]I don't know.
[381:17.30]Probably.
[381:19.03]Okay.
[381:19.39]So I'm just going to go for this alley dead ahead.
[381:21.59]Is this person on the ladder?
[381:26.97]Oh, he just knocked that person off the ladder.
[381:37.24]They're freaking out down there.
[381:38.44]Alright, we have to move.
[381:40.66]Oh shit.
[381:41.16]Yeah, we gotta move.
[381:46.70]Where are we going from here?
[381:50.17]Uh... I need to get to the top of a really tall building to see if I can wingsuit.
[381:54.87]There's too many fucking people here.
[382:04.67]This is the street from last time.
[382:14.12]Is that a friendly dog?
[382:14.84]Oh, thank God.
[382:17.76]Okay, so we know how this ends.
[382:24.19]The tropper is just chasing me, but I'm behind you.
[382:28.57]The tropper is going to be overhead in a second.
[382:33.24]It's here.
[382:40.44]Oh, what happened?
[382:41.22]That hurt.
[382:52.75]Sucks.
[382:57.05]What about that alley straight ahead?
[382:58.31]To your right.
[383:00.34]Oh, fuck.
[383:01.76]Bad.
[383:02.32]Very bad.
[383:06.66]I'm hiding.
[383:09.98]I'm just hiding back here.
[383:10.74]Somehow I am technically still alive.
[383:14.36]I'm going to reload guns.
[383:23.36]Who sees me?
[383:25.02]Who sees me?
[383:27.56]Who sees me?
[383:29.66]Who sees me?
[383:31.80]Who sees me?
[383:40.25]Just hang over there.
[383:41.07]I'll hang over here.
[383:41.83]I can't hang over there anymore.
[383:45.29]I got an idea.
[383:49.59]I'm out of ammo for a lot of...
[383:54.13]Oh, this is bad.
[383:54.87]Okay, I'm gonna go for something here.
[384:01.71]Ow!
[384:12.24]Okay.
[384:17.96]Fixing my broken... Ow.
[384:19.85]Ow.
[384:20.94]Alright, I kinda went around to the right side.
[384:22.62]I'm gonna see if there's anything over here we can do.
[384:26.14]Have they sounded the alarm already?
[384:28.31]I think so.
[384:31.31]Like, on the roof?
[384:38.42]Damn it!
[384:38.96]They really don't want you to go over there.
[384:40.96]Yeah.
[384:42.10]Like, E1 is super off limits.
[384:50.78]Manhole?
[384:51.44]Manhole.
[384:51.90]There's a manhole.
[384:56.36]Where is it?
[384:58.56]Dude, come to me.
[384:59.48]Holy shit.
[385:01.80]This is the way in.
[385:02.34]Okay.
[385:04.06]This is actually the way in.
[385:06.07]Where are you?
[385:08.49]Uh, I'll just throw yourself out of the building.
[385:10.67]I have no idea how I got here.
[385:13.73]There is no wingsuit, yeah.
[385:15.39]No wingsuit.
[385:17.32]Not permitted at this location.
[385:18.82]Alright, I'm dead.
[385:20.05]So don't die.
[385:20.63]I'm just going to hide.
[385:29.29]I got to switch guns too.
[385:36.17]These are armor piercing.
[385:36.91]25%.
[385:36.93]Damn it.
[385:48.51]I just feel like the Metal Gear Solid death sound.
[385:53.49]I'm here.
[385:53.83]Okay.
[385:54.97]Take a look at this.
[385:57.43]Interesting, huh?
[385:58.71]Oh God.
[386:00.71]Don't do what I did.
[386:01.27]Don't do what I did.
[386:01.81]Don't do what I did.
[386:04.14]Nice and slow.
[386:13.30]Oh, we got flash gamer flashlights and everything.
[386:15.52]Isn't this the tutorial sewer?
[386:18.30]Yeah.
[386:19.46]There are alligators down here.
[386:22.03]You're gonna turn into one.
[386:22.81]Are they hostile?
[386:29.49]Let's not find out.
[386:32.59]Um... Are we gonna like pop up in his bathroom?
[386:36.53]Like in his toilet?
[386:46.27]There's a... I mean, that... We could, but we would just be copying.
[386:52.64]Alright, I'm not going to go out yet because I feel like... You might put your head out and die.
[386:57.04]Is it safe?
[386:58.10]There's a tank out here.
[386:59.34]Okay.
[386:59.78]Hang on.
[387:00.28]If we stay crouched, completely hidden, there's a chance we might... If they're not in the tank already, we might be able to get in the tank.
[387:08.23]Oh, bro.
[387:10.45]Okay.
[387:10.75]That sounds like a great idea.
[387:12.31]Ready?
[387:12.99]Ready?
[387:14.17]I don't have a silencer.
[387:15.35]There's a guy right to your left.
[387:16.49]Right to your left.
[387:16.97]Literally right next to us.
[387:18.29]You will see that.
[387:18.83]Okay, I'm taking the shot.
[387:20.95]But what about the guy right here?
[387:22.45]Tank person's dead.
[387:27.65]Take care of the alarm.
[387:30.13]I will shoot the alarm.
[387:32.99]What?
[387:33.89]Did you get it?
[387:34.91]No, he got in.
[387:36.02]Oh, shit.
[387:36.36]Oh, no.
[387:36.92]I don't know what to do.
[387:38.96]I don't know what to do.
[387:39.88]I don't know what to do.
[387:40.42]I'm freezing in panic.
[387:41.52]I'm going to go this way.
[387:43.16]I'm gonna- I don't know what to do.
[387:44.12]Where do I go?
[387:44.78]I'm gonna go this way.
[387:45.48]I think I'm running over here.
[387:48.12]Oh, yeah!
[387:51.48]Just run, just run, just run, just run, run, run, run, run.
[387:54.12]Back in the sewer?
[387:54.72]Hey, can you get back into the sewer?
[387:57.49]Oh, shit!
[387:59.01]No!
[388:02.89]He went into the tank.
[388:05.25]Yeah, like, he- okay.
[388:06.69]It's like, his animation started getting into the tank before I could, like, shoot him to get out of it.
[388:11.47]Damn it!
[388:14.23]He just started speeding.
[388:20.92]I freaked out.
[388:21.36]I didn't know where to go.
[388:21.88]I didn't know if I was going to run into a bunch of enemies.
[388:23.46]Alright, last try.
[388:24.44]One more try.
[388:24.91]Let's go for it.
[388:25.39]Okay, last try.
[388:26.01]Let's try going a different route.
[388:27.89]I'm going to put armor piercing on every single weapon you have.
[388:30.29]Let's try taking a different path.
[388:43.16]I don't know for sure if I was allowed to take the tank.
[388:46.64]There was no prompt.
[388:49.46]How do you craft ammo?
[388:50.96]Can you craft ammo?
[388:53.08]Some guns.
[388:54.84]You pick, like, primary weapon, whatever.
[388:58.89]Then the gun.
[388:59.43]It should be the first attachment mod.
[389:04.63]I really don't have enough to do armor piercing for... It's annoying.
[389:13.89]have to emp a tank to steal it you actually can have an emp really to disable vehicles but I don't know how to get it now you up you change your backpack oh they're here what do you mean they're here stun grenade smoke grenades dynamite I don't have we don't have emps I don't think there's a perception grenade
[389:44.48]I don't really know what that is.
[389:47.94]Yeah, EMP.
[389:48.82]Sticky EMP grenade.
[389:49.98]Blast grenade EMP.
[389:53.57]Acquire Supremo from Juan's office or his arms dealers.
[389:56.73]We have to do it first.
[389:59.93]Yeah.
[390:01.49]Oh, well.
[390:05.15]Go right in the sewers this time.
[390:06.63]It'll lead you to the compound.
[390:07.73]Okay, good to know.
[390:13.50]No armor piercing?
[390:14.42]I can't... Come on.
[390:15.44]There's a... If you look at your pack, your Supremo pack, and then mods, there's one for, like, minor armor piercing protection, and there's also one for just run faster.
[390:28.71]Like, it's like a go faster.
[390:33.45]Sharpshooter killstreak.
[390:35.08]Poison powered.
[390:35.88]Okay.
[390:43.55]Somebody, what a, that's actually a really good idea.
[390:45.75]Dude, what are we thinking?
[390:47.63]This person's brilliant.
[390:48.53]I want that person to be, um, I'm going to time them up for 10 seconds, just so people know who it was.
[390:53.19]Um, somebody said that I should just hide in the sewer and be your spawn point.
[390:59.70]While you just try to get into the compound.
[391:03.12]You could.
[391:06.36]That's a great idea.
[391:16.78]You ready?
[391:17.72]Hold on.
[391:20.38]Classic Halo strat.
[391:23.76]Dude, Halo 1.
[391:24.30]That's what you do.
[391:26.68]To play Halo on Legendary.
[391:29.15]Somebody is the spawn.
[391:30.27]Can we grapple this?
[391:34.37]We're going to get back to that sewer.
[391:43.05]Alright, back to that sewer.
[391:44.21]I don't remember where it was.
[391:45.01]It's that eyeball on the map.
[391:48.25]Holy shit!
[391:49.19]They've all... They were all just about to collapse on us.
[391:53.28]Uh, luckily I put armor piercing rounds on my... Well, that saves us some time.
[392:03.01]Rifle here.
[392:03.57]Hey!
[392:10.84]Yep.
[392:11.42]Okay.
[392:13.04]Good.
[392:13.30]So now... Alright, how do we... Dude, how the fuck did we... Oh, right here.
[392:18.56]Um...
[392:38.24]Follow the eyes.
[392:39.54]Nobody remembers a plus five minus five.
[392:46.89]What happened?
[392:48.21]What happened?
[392:51.65]You good?
[392:52.21]I broke my arm.
[392:52.65]Why are you going this way, by the way?
[392:54.67]I don't know.
[392:59.21]We need to get to that eyeball.
[393:05.51]The eyeball?
[393:07.23]Eyeball on the map.
[393:11.26]Where are these guys coming from?
[393:12.74]Are they shooting the dog?
[393:22.58]I don't know.
[393:25.94]Chorizo's getting them.
[393:40.23]Well, this is clearing them out.
[393:40.97]This is good.
[393:42.51]Yeah, but don't they just respawn?
[393:44.19]Do they?
[393:44.51]Alright.
[393:48.24]We got to get this way.
[393:50.04]Okay.
[393:53.10]Chorizo is down.
[393:57.46]Where is Guapo?
[393:59.72]I don't know.
[394:00.24]Where is Guapo?
[394:00.86]What happened to Guapo?
[394:02.00]I got to go heal Chorizo.
[394:10.71]I didn't do it long enough!
[394:12.03]I didn't do it long enough!
[394:12.95]I didn't do it long enough!
[394:24.85]Wait, here's Guapo.
[394:27.83]What?
[394:28.85]Has he been here the whole time?
[394:31.76]Alright, let's go.
[394:32.66]I don't know where you were going before, but you went in a full circle and were just killing people.
[394:36.20]I don't know how I got to that eye.
[394:39.12]See the eyeball on the map?
[394:40.80]That's where the sewer is.
[394:41.52]That's where we need to go.
[394:42.24]I think we have to go this way.
[394:44.74]See the blue marker?
[394:45.83]Oh, actually, I think we can go down here and take a right.
[394:49.47]See the little blue map down here?
[394:50.87]That's supposed to do a kill.
[394:56.29]I hate that.
[394:56.87]I hate that.
[394:57.75]I hate that I just had to do that.
[395:08.41]Yeah, this is the right way.
[395:16.69]Now we go through here and then we go... This way?
[395:24.71]This way.
[395:29.79]Oh my god, that guy fucking exploded.
[395:35.00]Oh my god.
[395:40.42]Then this way.
[395:40.96]Okay.
[395:46.03]It's one of those things that fires and explodes in front of people's faces.
[395:50.75]He's dead.
[395:51.03]Okay.
[395:57.65]Okay.
[395:58.55]Gamer moments.
[396:01.49]Now we need the sewer.
[396:04.31]Which, where the fuck is it?
[396:07.19]Shit!
[396:08.73]Where is it?
[396:09.09]It's definitely... Okay, I think it was this way.
[396:10.85]You're just going to have to ignore these guys.
[396:13.34]And then it was to the right.
[396:15.74]Actually, I don't know.
[396:16.26]I teleported to you.
[396:17.06]No, this is the wrong way.
[396:17.72]Hold on.
[396:19.42]We need to go... This is where I went before I died, yeah.
[396:22.98]Shit, I have no idea.
[396:25.04]Straight and then right?
[396:26.24]Straight and right.
[396:26.94]Right there.
[396:27.30]Straight and right?
[396:32.24]I think it actually could be this way.
[396:38.63]Did you just walk through this, like, checkpoint thing?
[396:40.61]Uh-huh.
[396:43.87]Holy shit.
[396:50.48]Yep, bingo.
[396:54.68]Don't... Chorizo?
[396:58.21]Run, Chorizo!
[397:01.31]Where's Guapo?
[397:02.15]Alright, there he is.
[397:02.63]Let's go.
[397:04.43]Alright, so now, like I said, in the sewer, go right.
[397:07.86]And that'll get us to the compound.
[397:09.90]You alright?
[397:10.46]Stop kicking me!
[397:11.40]I'm dead.
[397:11.74]Oh god!
[397:12.10]Oh!
[397:12.50]Don't die.
[397:12.90]What the fuck?!
[397:13.70]Are you dead?
[397:14.30]Nope!
[397:14.54]Almost, though!
[397:34.09]He's coming!
[397:34.51]He's coming!
[397:38.41]Are you petting him?
[397:39.15]If you die right now.
[397:42.30]I'm going to die.
[397:43.16]You understand?
[397:45.26]Did you stop to pet Chorizo while they were coming around the corner?
[397:49.76]Yes.
[397:56.04]I could have just gone in the sewer.
[397:57.98]It's too much pressure fighting people like 10 levels higher than us.
[398:03.31]Guys, I have the same gear I got from the tutorial.
[398:06.15]Alright, we can get there in five seconds if we don't go on a loop the first time.
[398:14.05]Alright, let's go, go, go, go, go, go.
[398:19.83]I was curious to see if you had invincibility frames if you pet one of the animals.
[398:27.08]Because it would have been huge.
[398:30.80]Alright, where did you go down?
[398:33.20]Yeah.
[398:39.20]I didn't do it.
[398:41.62]Oh, I'm here!
[398:46.55]There's a lot of guys down there.
[398:50.69]Holy sh- Oh my god, it is.
[398:51.93]Are these bad guys- These are bad guys too, over here!
[398:56.45]That was a great throw.
[399:00.68]Oh, fuck!
[399:01.44]Be careful!
[399:04.10]Yeah, we just need to get in the sewer.
[399:06.08]All that matters is the sewer.
[399:08.10]Just exactly where we just were.
[399:14.00]Okay, you fucking stupid ass game.
[399:23.29]How am I seeing all this and you're not seeing any of it?
[399:26.79]I'm just trying to stay alive, man.
[399:29.07]I'm just trying to live.
[399:29.76]There are people that are doing some insane shit.
[399:46.43]Yep, right behind you.
[399:53.69]Alright, let's go.
[400:00.49]That guy died like six times.
[400:01.87]Okay, hard right.
[400:05.87]Watch out, that guy's got a bomb.
[400:10.01]Alex!
[400:10.83]Did somebody set us up?
[400:12.88]Where are you going?
[400:13.62]Just come here.
[400:14.46]Where are you going?
[400:15.52]This guy has a rocket launcher.
[400:16.90]Turn around.
[400:17.36]He's fine.
[400:19.30]I'm just trying to be erratic so he doesn't kill us.
[400:21.78]Alright.
[400:22.64]They're coming through the checkpoint, though.
[400:35.44]Where are they shooting us from?
[400:37.34]Both sides.
[400:38.84]I'm dead.
[400:39.24]I'm down.
[400:40.48]I have no idea who's shooting me.
[400:41.38]I think he's up top.
[400:42.90]He's up top.
[400:43.26]Okay.
[400:44.08]Let's just go through.
[400:44.84]We're going to go.
[400:47.64]I got shield.
[400:49.16]I'll lead the way.
[400:49.78]I'm so glad you're in front.
[400:56.45]That guy just John-wicked.
[400:58.13]He has a rocket launcher.
[400:59.37]This guy's got a rocket launcher.
[401:00.71]The edible kicked in like fucking 10 minutes ago.
[401:02.71]I am so glad you're in front of me.
[401:12.05]Oh no, you're on fire.
[401:13.37]Don't spread it over me.
[401:15.83]Alright, I'm just going in the fucking sewer to be your spawn point.
[401:18.78]For the love of God.
[401:20.54]Alright, where do... Uh-oh.
[401:26.68]Good, because I'm about to die.
[401:27.98]He's got a flamethrower.
[401:28.94]That's fine.
[401:30.18]I'm your spawn point.
[401:31.02]I'm here.
[401:38.24]I just... He's just chasing you.
[401:41.19]Yeah, he's just chasing me with fire.
[401:43.35]I can't get away.
[401:47.52]Oh, he changed guns.
[401:49.88]If you just die, we'll be fine.
[401:54.70]There's just so much fire.
[401:56.10]I can't kill one guy.
[401:57.46]Hopefully he kills you.
[401:59.54]Your time to shine.
[402:00.20]Everybody's coming down here, right?
[402:06.02]Why does he look like he's coming to get me?
[402:08.72]He's thinking about it.
[402:10.66]Why do I hear bullets being shot?
[402:11.86]Oh, it goes guapo.
[402:17.20]I got 33%.
[402:20.42]Okay, we're good.
[402:22.07]Somebody said go right in the sewer and it gets to the compound.
[402:25.97]I was like 80 meters away from whatever the objective was.
[402:29.65]Really?
[402:30.89]But I may have set the objective marker way too close.
[402:33.43]Oh.
[402:36.22]There you are.
[402:36.72]Okay.
[402:37.84]Yeah, let's go to yours.
[402:39.02]Alright.
[402:41.90]Okay.
[402:42.27]I'm here.
[402:43.75]I'm running out of ammo, but I'm here.
[402:45.15]Yeah, me too.
[402:51.63]Okay.
[402:52.03]I'm not going to res Guapo.
[402:53.76]Sorry.
[402:58.68]Good.
[402:59.22]Very good.
[403:00.50]Well done.
[403:02.00]I'm going to...
[403:05.65]I would not go up there.
[403:06.55]Is this person alive?
[403:09.97]Are they dead now?
[403:16.05]They are dead now.
[403:17.05]Okay, Guapo's back.
[403:19.78]Combat's over, actually.
[403:21.50]Is it?
[403:22.08]Okay.
[403:23.88]Are you going to go... Are you going to check and see if you can just walk into the compound?
[403:30.05]I'm just going to go back.
[403:30.65]Remember that we ran into the tank?
[403:34.69]Yeah.
[403:35.19]I feel like that's kind of where we're going, right?
[403:37.35]I think so.
[403:39.73]Wait, did we come from this way?
[403:40.77]Or are we going this way?
[403:42.84]We are going kind of that way.
[403:44.16]New gun?
[403:44.58]That's pretty good.
[403:45.30]There's two dogs here.
[404:01.01]Oh, get in.
[404:01.65]Get in.
[404:03.25]Wait, hang on.
[404:03.91]Are you back there?
[404:04.96]Where'd you go?
[404:05.50]I'm in the sewer, man.
[404:06.28]I'm not leaving the sewer.
[404:09.16]I'm like on the street level.
[404:10.26]You're going to have to catch up to me, though, right?
[404:17.06]I mean, should I just go from the sewer?
[404:19.82]Yeah, you can go this way.
[404:22.82]You can go up to me, at least.
[404:23.78]You want me to come up to you?
[404:25.06]Are you sure you want me to?
[404:26.10]Yeah, because we're going to get... I could just keep going until I teleport you, I guess.
[404:30.39]That's true.
[404:34.35]Are we certain that you'll be able to... People are saying stay in the sewer.
[404:38.78]People are saying sewer, sewer, sewer.
[404:40.06]You have to do the sewer.
[404:40.74]Sewer is the only way.
[404:42.96]Apparently people are saying sewer is the only way.
[404:46.08]Oh, okay.
[404:46.72]Well then maybe... I'm just going in a circle then.
[404:55.64]Or maybe chat just really wants you to stay in the sewer just to see how long you'll do it.
[404:59.98]That's fine.
[405:04.86]You go... You got to tank through the sewer.
[405:07.76]Stay in the sewer.
[405:17.83]What are you doing down here?
[405:18.81]There's somebody down here.
[405:22.33]Okay, I'm gonna die so I can respawn on you in the sewer.
[405:25.38]Yeah.
[405:27.80]Who killed Guapo?
[405:42.04]What am I doing down here?
[405:43.24]He was the protagonist of a different story.
[405:51.03]You better not die.
[405:51.93]Don't do anything stupid.
[405:52.89]I am standing still.
[405:54.51]I'm not going anywhere.
[405:56.76]Don't get surprised by a crocodile.
[405:58.56]I won't.
[405:58.80]There's no crocodiles down here.
[406:09.82]It's a pretty good side character POV.
[406:12.39]That's fine.
[406:12.71]I just want to make sure we are alive.
[406:22.23]Okay, here we go.
[406:23.37]I'm here.
[406:23.65]Alright.
[406:24.97]So people are saying to go straight and then go right.
[406:32.67]What's that crock?
[406:34.79]Did you say that?
[406:35.41]We got bad guys in the rear.
[406:39.50]I think we can outpace them.
[406:43.34]They'll go right.
[406:44.32]I'm assuming this means right.
[406:52.55]How did we die down here the first time?
[406:54.15]Did we both jump or something?
[406:58.83]This goes out of the sewer.
[407:00.01]I'm staying here.
[407:02.89]This is a tank.
[407:04.92]Again.
[407:05.12]Yeah, this is a tank.
[407:06.30]This is the other way.
[407:06.84]Wrong way, other way, other way.
[407:07.90]Apparently it's the other side?
[407:10.05]Yeah, I'm on the wrong side here.
[407:12.81]He said there were people down here, right?
[407:19.91]Yep, they're right here.
[407:26.30]They said hug right.
[407:34.64]There's crocodiles here now too.
[407:35.58]That guy's still shooting me and you were right in front of him.
[407:38.91]Yeah, I have a shield.
[407:40.41]Would you shoot the shield guy?
[407:44.31]So left instead of right?
[407:48.15]I guess.
[407:49.13]There's just a secret back here.
[407:50.97]This is wrong.
[407:53.01]It's secret helmet.
[407:59.82]We have to get here.
[408:07.83]I guess we have to just go through where the tank is.
[408:12.79]Chat, what the heck?
[408:13.39]I thought you guys were helping us.
[408:16.31]The shotgun is like god-tier powerful.
[408:23.98]The pistol-shotgun-shield combo.
[408:28.24]Okay, well, we're gonna try... Watch out for the dog.
[408:30.82]There's a dog right next to you.
[408:33.30]A mean one.
[408:35.64]It is, yeah.
[408:39.38]Why is he not attacking you?
[408:45.04]How safe is it if I come up?
[408:47.75]20%?
[408:51.93]He knows?
[408:55.91]They, like, kind of know I'm here.
[408:57.35]Yeah, they know I'm here now.
[409:01.78]Sorry, dog.
[409:02.24]Okay, you... Guapo is down.
[409:07.49]I'm going for tank.
[409:08.43]Alright, you go for tank.
[409:09.87]Do you want me to help suppressing fire?
[409:14.37]I'm in.
[409:14.99]You're in the tank?
[409:16.08]I'm in the tank.
[409:16.76]Oh, hell yeah.
[409:17.46]Alright.
[409:20.32]But they have RPGs and shit.
[409:26.72]Okay.
[409:28.10]This is going to be a short-lived adventure.
[409:30.15]You think so?
[409:33.58]um both I don't think you should get in on the mounted turret that's for sure um I'm just gonna try moving so we need to go like that way kind of like right can we go right from here can you repair me if you come back down if you come this way yeah I don't want to go too far out hang on hang on I'm just gonna hop out and try to repair
[410:02.78]Where is this person that keeps seeing me?
[410:04.12]I don't know where they are.
[410:04.84]They're right there.
[410:06.94]Okay.
[410:13.98]Full health.
[410:15.62]That guy just tried to shoot a rocket at me.
[410:17.80]I think he's still looking at me.
[410:24.00]Press V?
[410:24.84]No, I know what V does.
[410:25.74]I don't want to do it right now.
[410:31.82]I can't get in your tank, though.
[410:34.12]You can, but then we'll just both die.
[410:36.15]That's true.
[410:37.31]There is a gunner seat, though.
[410:38.95]I don't know who keeps seeing me.
[410:42.73]There's somebody right across the way.
[410:49.01]I don't like... I'm on fire.
[410:50.01]Alright, what about... Can we go down... That road that's right next to you, can you go down that?
[410:56.30]This really doesn't take that much... Oh, shit.
[411:02.07]I shouldn't have gotten out.
[411:10.17]Did you pop up?
[411:12.27]Yeah.
[411:12.63]Fight or run?
[411:13.69]What the fuck?
[411:15.61]I think special forces are about to arrive.
[411:21.11]Wanted.
[411:21.63]We have to move.
[411:25.82]I'm moving.
[411:27.20]If we go down, can we go right?
[411:28.54]Can we go down this way?
[411:32.17]I'm stuck.
[411:34.47]I wonder if there's a way we can go.
[411:38.59]Back in the sewer?
[411:39.27]Because this is blocked off.
[411:44.61]We have to go left, but we can't.
[411:45.99]We have to go eventually.
[411:46.93]Are we supposed to go that way?
[411:54.70]Sewer chat.
[412:04.02]How do they keep getting up?
[412:06.14]They're like on the roof.
[412:08.13]Alright, there's a place we can go down here.
[412:09.91]This little alleyway.
[412:21.61]Is there anywhere?
[412:22.07]I don't think we can go anywhere.
[412:28.94]I can't.
[412:29.26]This thing doesn't turn like a tank should.
[412:36.46]Follow the blue line.
[412:37.66]Yeah, I'm trying to see where to even... We go... We have to go that way, but... What if we jumped on your tank to jump over the wall?
[412:45.43]Would that work?
[412:50.49]Watch out.
[412:50.85]I'm trying to repair you.
[413:05.87]Looking good.
[413:06.93]Why are you going in a circle?
[413:08.37]Because everything's blocked off.
[413:09.65]We're trying to find a place where we can get over one of the walls.
[413:14.72]Somebody behind us.
[413:20.58]I only see Guapo and my poor pup is just lying on the ground, writhing.
[413:25.46]We can't go this way.
[413:27.06]Kill my dog.
[413:29.03]Like, how do we... Maybe through here?
[413:39.96]I can't shoot?
[413:43.14]Fuck.
[413:45.50]Alright, Guapo, help me out.
[413:50.90]Is there a grapple?
[413:51.64]There's a grapple up here.
[414:00.47]Chiricho!
[414:02.57]You know, Jeremy, maybe the area isn't available to you to actually reach the point in this story.
[414:09.38]What is up here?
[414:09.92]Is that an explosive?
[414:16.76]I guess not.
[414:19.21]What is it?
[414:21.23]It's like a beacon on top of this place.
[414:27.23]Oh, shit.
[414:27.99]Crackle and pop machine gun.
[414:31.31]What happened?
[414:35.77]Light machine gun might actually be good here.
[414:37.23]That actually might be very good.
[414:40.85]Oh, this is where we tried to jump over.
[414:42.39]Alright.
[414:44.37]Hey, can you come to me?
[414:46.79]Oh, you're really far away.
[414:49.83]There's no grapple hook.
[414:53.59]All clear?
[414:58.66]Where is it?
[414:59.16]I have a door stuck situation.
[415:01.60]You've got a door stuck scenario.
[415:03.32]Yeah.
[415:06.55]Uh-oh.
[415:07.01]I might actually be stuck here.
[415:09.82]I feel like I can make it.
[415:19.22]Fight or run.
[415:20.00]They're now... Yeah, we know that.
[415:22.63]I'm coming back to you.
[415:26.63]Oh, you're very far away.
[415:28.97]Guys, I'm kind of just going in a circle because we don't know how to get into the center because I don't think you're allowed to.
[415:32.65]I don't think we can get in.
[415:35.34]There's one way.
[415:36.04]There's still one way.
[415:37.60]What is it?
[415:39.28]If I can actually... Okay, I wonder if you start wingsuiting from just outside the city limits, if it'll kill your wingsuit when you get in.
[415:49.67]Probably.
[415:50.05]You can, but I think the sewer is south of the tower area.
[415:56.35]Oh, so... Oh, dude, we've been in the wrong place the whole time.
[416:03.24]Have we?
[416:03.72]We need to be, like, here.
[416:08.72]We've been running around and the sewer is up here.
[416:10.68]We need to be down here.
[416:16.58]See these blue tunnels?
[416:21.78]Shit.
[416:21.88]Yeah.
[416:26.67]Okay, well, I'm just heading towards the new marker.
[416:41.20]So... How have we... If you look at the map... We've just been really far northwest.
[416:47.42]We're supposed to be down south of that area.
[416:50.96]Because see the blue lines?
[416:52.01]I think that's the sewers.
[416:55.81]We were getting like sewer directions for the wrong sewers.
[417:00.79]Damn it!
[417:02.07]Whatever.
[417:06.51]It's okay.
[417:07.05]I have a car.
[417:08.29]Or will have a car.
[417:10.10]Chorizo?
[417:10.44]Chorizo?
[417:12.85]Those guys literally just won.
[417:19.07]Why did they all run towards it?
[417:28.24]Thank you.
[417:30.12]Chopper.
[417:31.08]Chopper!
[417:31.50]Gameplay.
[417:36.86]Hold on.
[417:38.88]Gotta get closer.
[417:42.75]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[417:46.93]Nice.
[417:48.45]What a shot.
[417:58.56]Reloading.
[418:00.66]Almost there.
[418:01.84]Okay.
[418:06.97]Oh.
[418:16.24]Oh, is this car still here?
[418:17.28]This thing is insane, by the way.
[418:20.94]What?
[418:21.44]This car?
[418:22.89]Oh, the car that I... Let me get through this.
[418:24.19]Alright, get us to that sewer.
[418:26.63]We've got to find the manhole that's down here.
[418:29.67]I think this guy knows if... Wait, wait, wait.
[418:36.24]Hold, hold, hold.
[418:36.80]Hold, hold, hold.
[418:44.63]I'm going to your marker.
[418:46.03]No, go to that one.
[418:47.87]That's where we have to go.
[418:48.49]I think he knows we've been doing this.
[418:52.94]Yeah, we should get out.
[418:54.68]What?
[418:54.84]Yeah, because it's right here.
[418:55.84]There's a sewer right here.
[419:03.71]This is the sewer that we need to get into the compound.
[419:08.15]This is the secret sewer.
[419:10.91]We got the all clear.
[419:15.10]Don't do what I did.
[419:16.14]That kills you.
[419:18.32]Be very careful.
[419:22.92]Good fall, Joe.
[419:25.88]You're okay.
[419:26.38]Thank you.
[419:26.74]Alright.
[419:29.28]So now we have to just go from here.
[419:35.27]There's two ways.
[419:37.07]We got to go left.
[419:38.75]Yeah.
[419:39.17]Go left.
[419:40.05]This will take us through.
[419:41.01]Yep.
[419:42.69]This way.
[419:48.60]I don't know about this decision.
[419:51.72]Sewer looks awfully similar.
[419:53.24]Hang on, this is just free stuff.
[419:57.61]Oh, I get it all, even if I don't pick it up.
[420:02.03]Yep, we're about to be in his compound.
[420:12.09]This is the do or die right here.
[420:13.65]It's either we do it or we don't.
[420:16.31]So, we're in like another just kind of hellhole.
[420:21.87]Now, straight ahead, that building is his tower.
[420:32.54]Are there any people?
[420:33.92]I think these are civilians, yeah.
[420:35.96]Should we just holster?
[420:36.90]No, we're not supposed to be here.
[420:37.84]It's a kill on sight.
[420:42.06]The sleepy alien people are just standing outside yawning.
[420:49.15]Is there a front door?
[420:51.17]This is like in the movie when the bad guy tricks the good guy into thinking it was easy to get to this point, you know?
[420:57.94]And then like the lights come on.
[420:59.06]And they were expecting them to break in the entire time.
[421:03.06]Yeah, I don't... Can we go in here?
[421:09.76]This looks totally blocked.
[421:14.18]Shit.
[421:27.88]Okay.
[421:31.82]Okay, we're in.
[421:33.72]Alright, we're in.
[421:34.30]We're in.
[421:34.58]That guy was extremely surprised.
[421:38.27]Alright.
[421:39.67]No panicking.
[421:40.83]No panicking.
[421:41.31]We're going to get through this.
[421:42.07]We're going to go up all the way up the stairs.
[421:43.51]We need to play this together.
[421:46.79]Cover each other.
[421:49.99]Okay.
[421:50.57]Alright.
[421:50.85]Hang on.
[421:51.07]Hang on.
[421:51.31]Loot.
[421:52.87]Oop.
[421:54.19]There's no guards yet.
[421:55.51]Okay.
[421:56.41]We got a new shotgun.
[421:57.77]New shotgun.
[421:58.43]Wait.
[421:58.61]Hold on.
[421:59.09]Let me equip that.
[422:00.47]Cover me.
[422:01.31]I'll cover you.
[422:02.43]We got... Where are you?
[422:03.91]Oh, there you are.
[422:04.77]We got dogs incoming.
[422:06.65]I'm getting a shotgun equipped.
[422:09.32]Okay.
[422:10.24]Shotgun's equipped.
[422:14.76]Nice and easy.
[422:25.27]Can you go that way?
[422:26.05]No.
[422:33.80]Hopefully there's any way to go.
[422:36.26]Can we not go anyway?
[422:37.38]Because I'm looking at the enemy dog that's trying to get us in.
[422:40.86]They're just like pathing around.
[422:42.26]I would assume he's not open.
[422:52.88]I see a grapple point, but it's kind of outside.
[422:56.63]We can't go up.
[422:57.87]It's like... I hear somebody.
[423:01.59]Oh.
[423:04.35]Grapple on roof in big room.
[423:09.56]Shit.
[423:13.78]Hmm.
[423:15.36]Hmm.
[423:18.51]Like, I see that.
[423:19.33]I see that, too.
[423:22.36]Maybe that's outside.
[423:28.38]Definitely not available from here.
[423:30.73]Oh my god!
[423:37.73]Alright, we're fine.
[423:38.35]Come out here.
[423:47.28]The grapple looks like it was on this side.
[423:49.14]It was definitely like inside, but also not on the first floor.
[423:54.09]Yeah, it's like it's like right there.
[423:57.51]Shit.
[424:03.01]They've protected him.
[424:04.29]I don't think we can get in there.
[424:05.55]An impenetrable locked door.
[424:07.59]Damn it.
[424:09.61]We can't get up there.
[424:18.38]I don't think, um, I don't think you can fly anything here.
[424:24.75]No, you know, it's probably, it's probably like it loads the area probably.
[424:28.07]It's probably story locked.
[424:37.36]What are you doing?
[424:38.56]Dog's like attacking me while I'm like smoking a cigar.
[424:40.94]I'm sorry, dog, but I'm gonna die.
[424:43.30]I don't think there's any other place we can go.
[424:47.65]Is there a helicopter around here?
[424:51.99]I mean, we could look.
[424:56.09]If there is, I don't know where it would be.
[425:06.37]Wait, that's a good dog.
[425:07.01]No, it's not.
[425:08.70]That's a bad dog.
[425:10.42]That hurt.
[425:14.61]The dog barking at us and attacking.
[425:17.17]That's not a good dog.
[425:21.89]Why does that work for you?
[425:23.69]You can't slide tackle him.
[425:25.60]They're running into the building.
[425:27.18]I don't think there's a... I think we're screwed.
[425:32.14]I think we're probably screwed too.
[425:38.42]Hang out.
[425:38.78]Wait for him to leave and go to a restaurant or something.
[425:41.43]I'm dead.
[425:44.94]But I cleared the street.
[425:51.64]Use the vent?
[425:53.46]Jerma vent.
[425:54.26]Jerma vent.
[425:54.96]Jerma vent.
[425:55.50]Is this an Among Us thing?
[426:01.08]Probably.
[426:03.52]Come out and face us.
[426:06.77]Alright, well that was fun.
[426:10.67]I don't think we're getting in here.
[426:12.17]At least we made it.
[426:13.59]We did make it here though.
[426:17.93]I mean, it was a good idea.
[426:20.59]What the?
[426:22.15]I'm getting hit markers.
[426:25.19]Someone has health up there.
[426:28.36]Oh, that was me dying.
[426:29.16]Oops.
[426:32.22]Alright, that's it.
[426:34.58]Yeah, I'm just giving it one last look-see.
[426:37.74]I would assume that this area changes when you're supposed to come here.
[426:42.68]It probably does.
[426:54.43]Where are you?
[426:55.30]Oh, you're in that building.
[426:58.62]I was just thinking if there's a way to, like... Like, there's not really, like, a jetpack.
[427:05.09]This thing only has, like, a little boost.
[427:07.77]We need, like, a helicopter or a plane or something.
[427:28.81]Okay.
[427:30.75]Well played.
[427:31.31]I was hoping maybe I could like... No.
[427:40.24]Oh well.
[427:43.21]We're basically playing Deathloop in Far Cry 6.
[427:47.85]Yeah, it's alright.
[427:52.37]That was fun though.
[427:53.90]Yeah.
[427:57.07]Climb up his leg like a kitten.
[428:00.25]Hey, someone just find where the helicopter spawns are.
[428:06.95]This is a long stream.
[428:07.77]Um, it's long.
[428:08.79]I mean, look, we're having fun.
[428:10.11]Alright.
[428:28.51]Turns people to stone.
[428:29.37]Help.
[428:32.61]I'm bleeding here.
[428:34.03]My body's on fire.
[428:35.39]Don't you love in games when the shotgun shoots and it rips to the right like this?
[428:44.04]Yeah.
[428:44.28]What's up with that recoil?
[428:47.02]I don't know.
[428:47.38]You see the recoil on this?
[428:49.26]Look at this.
[428:52.40]That's a lot.
[428:58.70]This little pistol is really powerful.
[429:02.42]Jesus.
[429:03.82]What the fuck?
[429:05.15]Does your shotgun do that?
[429:07.21]No.
[429:07.55]Yours is like shooting fire.
[429:08.83]I think that's the one you found, right?
[429:10.23]Look at this.
[429:10.95]You see how crazy the recoil is though, right?
[429:18.08]Hold on.
[429:18.88]Let me switch weapons.
[429:19.96]Let me try it out.
[429:23.56]I can barely even aim it on my screen.
[429:25.16]This gun sucks.
[429:29.36]It's, uh, the El Ruby?
[429:31.26]Yeah.
[429:32.18]Alright, let me try.
[429:35.96]Shoot it.
[429:36.24]Holy shit.
[429:52.67]Alright, I'll see you later.
[429:54.37]I'm done.
[429:55.93]It was fun.
[429:57.05]Uh, everybody.
[429:57.85]This was Far Cry 6.
[430:00.26]This is Etalyx.
[430:00.92]Let me shoot this guy.
[430:01.50]Let me get the kill.
[430:02.08]That was fun.
[430:06.74]Uh, if you don't know Etalyx, this is Etalyx.
[430:09.58]And he screams.
[430:10.98]He's got a good scream.
[430:13.01]Screamer.
[430:13.75]Yeah, it was fun.
[430:17.55]Make an objective.
[430:19.29]Make objectives for yourself.
[430:21.14]Okay, so hey, the first part of the movie's over.
[430:28.14]What we did is we went actually up to the projector room and we fast-forwarded the movie with everyone still in there, just being like, what the fuck is going on?
[430:37.08]Why are we fast-forwarding to the end?
[430:42.92]You know, you might be able to do that for the other guys.
[430:47.24]Maybe not, but that'd be pretty cool.
[430:50.05]Alright, I'll, uh, I'll talk to you later, dude.
[430:52.42]Thanks for playing this one.
[430:55.40]Somebody said, I'll see you next year.
[430:56.90]Oh, interesting.
[430:58.00]You'll see me next year?
[430:59.36]How about, um, are we, are we doing the other thing?
[431:02.66]The Man of Medan?
[431:03.88]Yeah, we're doing Man of Medan.
[431:05.04]Yeah, that's Man of Medan's free, right?
[431:08.02]Or is it Man of Medan 4?
[431:09.00]That's like, that's like in two weeks.
[431:11.08]Oh, shit.
[431:11.96]Look at that.
[431:14.78]Yeah, I gotta play Man of Medan with Etalyx.
[431:16.62]That's how it works.
[431:17.16]Can't get rid of me that easy.
[431:19.04]Thought I wish I could.
[431:22.20]Got to try harder.
[431:23.06]Yeah, well, we'll see you again in a couple weeks.
[431:28.86]Or Man of Medan.
[431:29.70]That's not the name of the game.
[431:30.68]That's just the only one I could remember.
[431:32.53]That's what it should be called.
[431:35.67]Alright.
[431:37.87]I'll talk to you soon, dude.
[431:39.21]I don't know if you're still streaming or not, but if not, then I'll talk to you soon.
[431:43.21]I'm done.
[431:44.13]But thanks for playing.
[431:45.31]It was very enjoyable in...
[431:48.94]in and of itself, just being shitty, but also, you know, just having some good laugh-out-loud moments.
[431:53.80]Yeah, and look, Far Cry, look, the grade out, 6 out of 10, that's fine, but it's fun to play with friends.
[432:00.40]It just is.
[432:02.75]Yeah, it is a co-op game.
[432:06.45]We'll see you later.
[432:06.95]Thanks a lot, dude.
[432:08.43]Bye-bye.
[432:08.75]Good night, Germachat.
[432:11.11]Bye.
[432:12.19]Alright, he's gone.
[432:15.17]Yeah, we'll do the, um... Oh, what?
[432:17.05]Why did my computer just crash?
[432:20.33]Is my computer crashing?
[432:27.40]Hello?
[432:27.68]Anybody hear me?
[432:40.20]Hello?
[432:59.52]Hello?
[432:59.80]Can you hear?
[433:02.38]Oh, okay.
[433:06.02]No, we can hear you.
[433:08.76]Alright.
[433:10.18]My computer just crashed.
[433:11.34]I lost the access to my other monitor.
[433:13.87]Everything went onto my main screen.
[433:15.33]Everything was black for like 10 straight seconds and I have no audio.
[433:20.27]Say 50 in the chat if you can hear me.
[433:22.87]I need to know.
[433:29.65]Okay, alright, good.
[433:32.17]That was really weird.
[433:32.95]My left monitor is, like, dead.
[433:35.96]I think my graphics card crashed when I exited the game.
[433:40.10]Alright.
[433:41.66]Uh, thanks for watching, everybody.
[433:42.58]We'll see you again, uh, probably some point in the middle of the week.
[433:46.74]Um, probably gonna stream on... Uh, maybe Thursday?
[433:53.26]Tuesday?
[433:53.74]Thursday or Thursday, maybe?
[433:58.84]Wednesday?
[433:59.98]Keep an eye on the, uh, on the sus.
[434:01.78]It's gonna be some point midweek.
[434:05.10]Um, and you're probably asking, what are we gonna play?
[434:07.57]I, you know, I have no idea.
[434:11.55]I was thinking about maybe, uh, what are people saying in the chat?
[434:16.03]Smite, smite, smite, wanna play smite?
[434:18.25]Smite, smite.
[434:19.00]I mean, uh, that's a fun one.
[434:20.74]That's alright.
[434:22.36]I mean, a lot of people in the chat are saying it.
[434:27.15]A lot of people are saying it.
[434:28.13]That's interesting.
[434:35.08]Yeah.
[434:35.56]Well, maybe we'll play Smite.
[434:38.84]We said, fuck you.
[434:39.73]Come on.
[434:42.55]Just relax, man.
[434:45.08]There's no need for that kind of vulgarity.
[434:46.90]What about the Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl?
[434:48.62]Oh, that did come out.
[434:50.64]That's not a bad idea.
[434:52.52]We'll figure out something.
[434:54.02]Just keep an eye on the sauce.
[434:54.92]I got some stuff to do this week.
[434:57.23]You'll get something mid-week and then we'll be back on the weekend at some point as well.
[435:01.99]I'll see you guys mid-week.
[435:02.99]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[435:04.07]That was Far Cry 6.
[435:05.17]It was a doozy.
[435:09.76]Have a great rest of your evening.
[435:11.56]Have a great rest of your day.
[435:15.05]Thanks a lot, guys.
[435:16.95]Good night.
[435:17.47]Goodbye.
[435:17.81]Take care of yourself.
[435:19.25]Thanks for the subs, as always.
[435:21.07]And I'm gonna reiterate this one more time.
[435:25.38]Money on this stream, it sees a lot.
[435:29.72]I tried to be pretty transparent about how much money this stream takes in.
[435:32.09]There's no, you don't need to, like, give this stream a shitload of money.
[435:36.45]Please don't.
[435:42.30]If you give this channel $5 a month, that is more than enough.
[435:46.24]Way more than enough.
[435:50.81]Realistically, nobody should really be ever giving this channel more than that amount per month.
[435:57.05]I can't stop people from doing that, but... You know.
[436:01.69]You guys know how much... GoodGuy98.
[436:04.86]I'm not trying to be... Well, you know, I'm like a good guy...
[436:13.64]I just don't want people to think I'm taking all this shit for granted.
[436:17.06]Because I'm not.
[436:18.42]I just hope people know that.
[436:19.36]I don't think there's much else I need to say.
[436:22.70]I'm just trying to do what I'm doing.
[436:28.55]Herman98.
[436:29.07]Yeah, goodnight guys.
[436:32.99]I'll see you guys later.
[436:34.17]Have a great rest of your evening.
[436:35.45]Goodbye.
[436:35.83]See you in the middle of the week.
[436:38.03]Keep an eye on the sus.
[436:39.99]I'm going to leave before a sub train happens because I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen.
[436:44.92]Alright, see you later.
[436:45.60]Bye-bye.
[437:29.64]you
