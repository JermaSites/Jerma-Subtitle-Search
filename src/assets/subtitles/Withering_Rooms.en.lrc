[00:39.99]Hello?
[00:42.38]What's up?
[00:43.69]Hold on.
[00:50.20]There we go.
[00:53.37]Good morning!
[00:54.46]It's 11.30, 11.50 a.m.
[01:02.62]And how the heck are you?
[01:04.91]That's just great.
[01:09.30]You missed the Fortnite live event?
[01:13.74]I'll catch it next year.
[01:18.53]I'll catch it next year or whatever.
[01:22.58]What about the Roblox live event?
[01:24.10]I'll catch it next year.
[01:25.35]It's okay.
[01:34.18]Hmph.
[01:42.80]What about Wizard101?
[01:45.85]I feel like somebody says that every day.
[01:51.05]But yeah, hello.
[01:52.30]I am here to play a game that I really like.
[01:58.54]This is going to be a video game.
[02:01.29]My voice is...
[02:02.48]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[02:04.38]It was really good to see you for the time that I was here.
[02:07.37]uh just didn't turn out I could do it today so alright I'll see you guys later it was great to see you have fun with the rest of whatever you're doing
[02:17.77]We're going to play Wuthering Rooms today.
[02:20.76]This is one of my favorite games of the last year or two.
[02:26.76]It's been, look at the title.
[02:29.00]Do I even need to say it?
[02:30.11]It's been long enough.
[02:34.13]I kind of forget everything, and that's a great thing that happens with a lot of media.
[02:38.81]It's why I'm able to play games like Dark Souls.
[02:42.38]Elden Ring is different, though.
[02:44.97]Since the hype of Elden Ring and the DLC, I actually have not gone back and played through it again.
[02:51.37]Elden Ring is such a monster game.
[02:53.08]It's such a massive game.
[02:56.71]that it's, I want to do a full, long playthrough again.
[03:02.01]But that's like 200 hours to do everything, including the DLC.
[03:09.47]This came out two years ago, bro.
[03:11.10]That's what I said, a year or two.
[03:18.55]Did you not hear the two in my year or two?
[03:21.12]It was one of my favorite games to come out in the last year or two.
[03:25.22]Damn it.
[03:30.18]Anyways, uh, play Bloodborne again.
[03:33.27]It's actually funny that you say that, because I...
[03:36.78]I opened up Bloodborne the other day.
[03:38.93]I was just like, whatever.
[03:40.34]Just kind of nice to go take a peek and see what it was like.
[03:45.36]and I beat the...
[03:49.07]I just beat the Bloodstarved Beast.
[03:52.47]And this is just on, I'm just playing.
[03:53.72]I just opened it and I'm like, I'm going to play for like a few hours.
[04:01.87]He hates it.
[04:05.11]What about that new FromSoftware game for the Switch 2?
[04:08.35]Yeah, I don't know.
[04:09.47]It's weird that it's a Switch 2 exclusive.
[04:15.63]That feels kind of weird.
[04:17.73]Especially considering they've been working on this for years.
[04:22.75]So a Switch 2 years in the making?
[04:25.66]That's...
[04:26.60]I'm very curious.
[04:34.49]Bloodborne was exclusive?
[04:37.49]That's true, but Bloodborne was a...
[04:40.00]A game that was...
[04:41.37]Does Nintendo have anything to do with, uh, Duskbloods?
[04:45.86]I don't think they do.
[04:52.66]Is Nintendo on top of it?
[04:55.24]No.
[05:00.22]Because I remember Bloodborne was a huge deal for Sony.
[05:02.99]That was a PS4 launch title, wasn't it?
[05:08.60]That was a big deal for Sony.
[05:18.19]Pretty much, yeah.
[05:20.24]WBloodborne.
[05:21.75]If I could VIP you.
[05:24.96]If I had the power to do that, I would do it.
[05:32.67]El Withering Rooms.
[05:34.00]Alright.
[05:34.71]I do have the power to do this.
[05:36.74]And I'm going to do it.
[05:37.67]I'm sorry.
[05:38.95]You are like a 10 year subscriber or something.
[05:42.15]But you are done.
[05:44.32]You're done.
[05:46.24]I almost just invited you.
[05:48.90]I almost clicked invite and I don't know that what that would have done.
[05:54.73]Oh, you're a one-year sub and you're saying that?
[05:57.22]L withering rooms?
[06:00.23]Oh, come on.
[06:05.21]Withering Realms Waiting Room.
[06:07.78]That's kind of hard to say.
[06:10.48]Withering Realms Waiting Room.
[06:15.28]Yeah, and, okay, we talked about this before, but whatever.
[06:18.61]My plan was I was going to play through Withering Rooms on stream before Withering Realms came out.
[06:27.03]But I, uh... Wuthering Rooms... No, Wuthering Realms got delayed by a pretty significant margin, so...
[06:37.12]It's now coming out somewhere in 2026.
[06:38.64]It was the early access was going to release in October of this year.
[06:44.09]But hey, it doesn't bother me at all.
[06:47.97]I will take a full completed... What is it?
[06:50.32]What's that famous quote?
[06:52.44]A bad game is bad forever.
[06:54.69]A delayed game is eventually good.
[06:57.66]That was... Miyamoto said that, right?
[07:01.77]That's a Miyamoto quote.
[07:04.52]Right?
[07:08.16]Was it Gabe Newell?
[07:12.74]It was Miyamoto or Gabe Newell.
[07:16.85]Hey, either one of them, okay?
[07:20.08]It was Ben Franklin.
[07:33.01]Are you gonna be scared?
[07:34.27]Okay, Withering Rooms is not a horror game.
[07:37.69]It is a creepy game.
[07:40.46]It's a kind of a creepy atmosphere.
[07:42.85]You can get jump scared, it's possible.
[07:46.59]But it's less of a horror game and more of a...
[07:49.80]I guess it kind of is a horror game.
[07:54.93]Yeah, it's like survival horror, but yeah, it's kind of everything.
[08:00.78]The reason I like this game, which you'll find soon here in the next few hours.
[08:05.68]This game is kind of every video game that I've kind of ever liked.
[08:11.92]It's like a Dark Souls type game, but not really.
[08:15.33]It's like Clock Tower, but not really.
[08:17.74]It's like Resident Evil, but not really.
[08:22.03]There's keys that go to that door, and you have to explore everything.
[08:24.89]Or don't.
[08:25.31]Be careful.
[08:25.79]What's in there?
[08:26.66]I don't know.
[08:27.31]Good luck, dickhead.
[08:33.84]And I believe it was made by one guy.
[08:37.16]I'm not sure if it was maybe two people that were involved, but I know that one guy did most of everything.
[08:42.76]It's a one guy project.
[08:47.80]And I love it.
[08:49.18]I will give you a little bit of a fair warning.
[08:51.41]It is a little rough, but that's why I like it.
[08:57.26]Some things kind of work.
[08:58.69]Some things don't work sometimes.
[09:01.77]But I actually love it.
[09:02.63]This is my game of the year.
[09:03.61]2023.
[09:09.52]Are you Withering Rooms' only fan?
[09:13.77]Uh, no.
[09:14.09]There are a lot of people that like this game.
[09:17.90]Hey, and guess what?
[09:18.57]If I'm withering, if I'm the only fan of withering rooms, good.
[09:23.50]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[09:25.21]Get it.
[09:25.51]Go get it.
[09:26.56]No, that's stupid.
[09:27.10]That's bad.
[09:28.06]What I mean is, like, no, no, everybody should try this.
[09:34.37]I don't mean to say I'm glad that... No.
[09:36.64]You know what I'm saying.
[09:37.95]I love this game.
[09:38.65]I think everyone should experience it.
[09:40.25]It's a great experience at game.
[09:42.62]It's cool.
[09:43.71]It's awesome.
[09:44.72]I love it.
[09:45.20]It's my game of the year from two years ago.
[09:46.67]Alright, everybody relax.
[09:51.80]Steam says April 2024 release date.
[09:54.34]I think it was an early access.
[09:57.27]But this dev does early access pretty well.
[09:59.92]I think he makes it pretty clear that he wants the game to be mostly tons of stuff to do in it.
[10:07.26]And I think he only really wants early access when it's in early access for a small period.
[10:12.27]Now, hey, take as long as you need.
[10:16.55]All of us Withering Rooms fans, we can wait as long as you need.
[10:26.26]Are you crashing out right now?
[10:27.31]No, this is going to be a hangout.
[10:28.62]Just play game stream.
[10:29.70]Okay.
[10:29.86]Everybody just needs to shut the fuck up.
[10:35.07]You know, I found it over the years.
[10:36.14]It's funny, like turning on a live stream where I am talking into a microphone, talking to people and telling you all to shut up this, like right when I start, you know what I mean?
[10:47.56]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[10:48.85]Oh, it's good to see you.
[10:49.77]Shut the fuck up.
[10:51.40]Shut up.
[10:52.73]Okay.
[10:58.71]You almost got me with the up-the-ass thing.
[11:00.70]I know the mods have disabled that.
[11:02.25]I think that you can't even say that term.
[11:03.88]And go ahead, try.
[11:04.66]You're going to get banned.
[11:12.77]I don't care.
[11:13.44]We're in whatever era.
[11:14.77]You can get permanently banned.
[11:16.17]I don't give a shit.
[11:20.28]Oh, he's on one today.
[11:22.50]Alright, let's go.
[11:23.06]This is one of my favorite games.
[11:24.11]I love it.
[11:25.17]So if anybody comes in here and they're like, Gerber, this game is fucking boring.
[11:30.35]Shove it up your ass, okay?
[11:33.84]And let's go.
[11:37.44]Soundtrack is A+.
[11:45.05]I would say this is up there.
[11:46.14]This is one of my favorite soundtracks.
[11:48.95]Have we played the OST, haven't we?
[11:52.65]It's wonderful.
[11:55.06]The game is kind of a slow start, but I want to do a little stream playthrough.
[11:59.10]I don't know if I'm going to beat the entire game.
[12:02.03]Maybe I will.
[12:04.56]Maybe I will.
[12:05.20]You've played this before.
[12:07.37]Yeah, I did like a little hey.
[12:09.12]Okay, when I played this before, I just kind of ran around and looked at stuff.
[12:14.14]Just because I wanted to shout the game out because I liked it so much.
[12:17.89]This time, this is different.
[12:20.42]This is, yeah, we're going to vibe it today.
[12:21.75]This is a vibe stream.
[12:22.97]And if you, by the way, if your vibes are off in this chat over here, I'll be fucking furious with you.
[12:32.59]Okay, new game.
[12:33.43]Uh... Dude, look it.
[12:36.58]Remember when I opened it?
[12:40.82]When was it, right here?
[12:42.99]No, wait, right here.
[12:46.01]So, new game.
[12:47.64]Oh, this is important.
[12:49.73]Let's get a poll in the chat.
[12:52.89]Do you want me to go...
[12:55.84]Melee build?
[12:59.54]Ranged build?
[13:01.41]Or magic?
[13:04.69]Melee, ranged, or magic?
[13:09.06]Wait, don't do the poll yet.
[13:11.28]Melee.
[13:12.63]Ranged.
[13:13.67]Magic.
[13:14.59]Because I said magic funny, so people would click it.
[13:17.08]Right?
[13:17.38]So I gotta make that...
[13:18.30]I have to have them all be funny.
[13:21.48]Oh, melee!
[13:23.20]Ranged!
[13:26.47]Oh my fucking god, everybody said magic.
[13:29.15]Hold on, do it again.
[13:31.07]God damn it, why did I do that?
[13:36.88]Alright, hold on.
[13:38.42]Run it one more time.
[13:47.67]I fucked it up already.
[13:48.77]I should have never said anything.
[13:50.66]Well, it's okay.
[13:51.40]Magic is cool in this game.
[13:52.53]No, fuck!
[13:53.68]Okay.
[13:55.65]My off-stream character was Magic, and it's great, I liked it, but whatever, fuck it.
[14:02.85]Why did I just not do ranged?
[14:04.47]I was like, hey, you know, maybe I should do something different.
[14:07.29]No.
[14:09.38]It's fine.
[14:10.03]Magic is cool.
[14:11.53]We'll do it.
[14:12.82]Melee is getting up there.
[14:14.18]I'd say, hey, melee.
[14:15.73]It's over.
[14:19.10]Alright, we'll do magic.
[14:20.46]Whatever.
[14:21.34]Play how you want.
[14:22.07]We'll say how the vibes are, okay?
[14:29.13]that don't close the game, it saves automatically.
[14:33.83]How's the audio here?
[14:34.57]Should we turn it up a little?
[14:41.87]I think that's good.
[14:44.50]Alright, let's go.
[14:49.35]And I'm gonna do voices.
[14:51.30]No, I'm not.
[14:55.57]Mostyn Gatehouse, 1892.
[14:56.86]In a dream, Nightingale is sent to Mostyn Private Asylum by her father.
[15:02.12]new patients must spend their first night in the gatehouse for observation.
[15:06.28]It is there that Nightingale first awakens in the dream.
[15:13.66]Do the voices, coward.
[15:18.94]Okay, here we are.
[15:21.69]I'm actually kind of excited to play this.
[15:23.52]It's been- I have not done it since I played it last time.
[15:26.83]Alright, some furniture can be interacted with with X.
[15:30.55]You can look around.
[15:33.03]It is like Clock Tower.
[15:34.52]If you like Clock Tower, you would love this game.
[15:41.42]Two coins?
[15:45.01]Reddit son or Tumblr daughter?
[15:49.25]Why did I read that?
[15:58.13]This is the shit they do on Moon Moon stream.
[16:01.52]I've probably heard all these already from Moon Moon.
[16:13.33]Uh... Yeah, I'm gonna go with Reddit's son.
[16:19.42]I'm gonna go with Reddit's son.
[16:21.99]I feel like him and I could argue about things.
[16:26.10]Now, son, I don't know where you read that, but let me tell you how it really is.
[16:34.78]I could have debates, family debates with the red sun, I think.
[16:45.58]-2, Redditor.
[16:49.75]You actually thought about it?
[16:51.32]What, for two seconds?
[16:52.70]Yeah, I didn't spend an hour thinking about it.
[16:56.23]Alright, so I got two coins.
[16:59.27]Father destroys his son in a heated debate.
[17:03.10]Yeah, because I could pull up, I could look at what he's looking at.
[17:05.39]He'd be like, oh, look at this article.
[17:06.71]I'd be like, you fucking idiot.
[17:09.77]What?
[17:09.97]Let me see what you got here.
[17:13.03]No, no, there's no enzyme in dog saliva that can go through, I don't know.
[17:24.17]I don't know either.
[17:25.19]Let me play my game.
[17:31.95]I was going to say that can like melt through fucking plastic or something.
[17:36.37]Alright.
[17:37.12]You can open doors.
[17:38.68]You have a conspiracy theory, son?
[17:40.23]I don't know.
[17:41.01]What do you read on Reddit?
[17:42.40]You read like fucking news and like politics and shit.
[17:47.83]I don't read Reddit anymore.
[17:48.98]I used to.
[17:49.48]Okay.
[17:54.04]A corpse in a cage.
[17:54.68]It's blocking a hole in the wall.
[17:59.54]I go on the Jerma page and post funny memes.
[18:02.70]You see?
[18:03.10]So then you and I, if I was your father, you'd say, hey, look at these funny memes I posted.
[18:10.38]I'd be like,
[18:10.76]Oh, hold on a minute.
[18:11.73]Let me see that one.
[18:12.41]That's a cat dancing with a top hat on?
[18:17.40]Go to your room.
[18:19.67]God, every day I've... Go to your fucking room.
[18:24.67]Every day I just wish I had a fucking Tumblr daughter.
[18:29.24]God.
[18:31.87]Cat memes.
[18:33.43]Oop.
[18:36.26]Alright, some furniture can be used to hide when close press triangle to hide.
[18:40.17]Stay hidden until monsters pass by.
[18:45.70]And the monsters are weird.
[18:56.12]This game is weird, by the way.
[18:57.66]I hope you're ready for some weird shit.
[19:06.40]Yeah, everything can be interacted with.
[19:07.77]You're looking for items.
[19:09.22]There's a keyhole in the grandfather clock.
[19:12.05]You better remember that.
[19:18.55]Okay, a special placement log.
[19:20.65]Shows the patients.
[19:23.55]Millie Erwood, 13.
[19:26.64]Emma Bainon, 13.
[19:30.26]Symptoms pending fires, inappropriate behavior,
[19:35.56]1892 patient Becca Mason.
[19:37.37]Disagreeableness headaches.
[19:44.12]Uh, patient Nightingale Williams, age 15, symptoms pending.
[19:51.76]Do you think I come here to feel normal?
[19:56.05]I think you just need to chill, alright?
[19:58.18]You guys need to chill out.
[19:59.83]This is my favorite game of 2023.
[20:02.74]Sit down.
[20:04.45]Yeah, you can peek through doors to see what's in them.
[20:07.66]Uh, things will kill you.
[20:09.45]By the way, roguelike mechanics.
[20:12.42]Did I mention that yet?
[20:15.72]There's a map too.
[20:17.29]Health is top right.
[20:21.28]Should I spoil it?
[20:22.28]Nah.
[20:29.34]Gatehouse hallway.
[20:30.37]Oh shit, okay.
[20:41.69]Show the boys Thanksgiving again.
[20:43.66]Nah, you've already seen it.
[20:48.14]You don't need to see it again.
[21:01.37]I don't want to aggro this guy.
[21:04.40]Maybe we'll show it again.
[21:08.77]I love the voice acting in this game too, it's great.
[21:13.74]I should have gone to that door.
[21:22.38]Stop hiding?
[21:25.27]Dude, give me that key.
[21:27.04]Ooh, alright, got the key.
[21:28.42]Gatehouse key.
[21:29.19]The key to the front door of the mansion's gatehouse.
[21:34.33]David, did you misplace the key again?
[21:36.38]I should nail it to your backside, you absolute pillock.
[21:43.24]I'm worried I have periodontal disease.
[21:45.00]You gotta floss.
[21:49.10]Okay, interact with the exit door to unlock it with the key.
[21:51.48]Okay, so this is it, probably right here.
[21:54.48]Yeah, there we go.
[21:54.94]There's the front door.
[21:57.26]Let me get some more items though.
[22:00.72]David's mind is literally decaying, but he can still be of use.
[22:04.40]To keep him from wandering the grounds, I've locked the gatehouse door.
[22:07.96]I nailed the spare key into his back in case you need it.
[22:11.47]You'll have to be sneaky.
[22:13.34]As an additional safeguard, I've cast a spell.
[22:15.71]That's what we'll be doing.
[22:17.51]On the front garden of the mansion.
[22:19.16]Oh my god, the garden.
[22:21.19]I have flashbacks.
[22:22.46]That place was fucking miserable.
[22:26.02]Wuthering Rome's son or blood-born daughter?
[22:28.76]Oh, damn.
[22:34.54]That's going to be a Bloodborne daughter.
[22:36.87]I'm sorry.
[22:37.55]I love this game, but that's a Bloodborne daughter.
[22:43.06]Okay.
[22:44.78]I cast a spell on the front garden of the mansion.
[22:46.29]No undead may pass through.
[22:48.03]If you're out there, check for the glowing white sigil above the doorway to make sure it's still working.
[22:53.05]Your blood-born daughter, Margaret.
[22:58.78]You can also read it like this too if you want.
[23:02.63]Oh shit, he's coming back No he's not
[23:11.34]A white sigil above the doorway indicates enemies cannot pass through.
[23:14.16]This is a safe zone, so there are safe zones.
[23:20.72]So there's nothing dangerous here that we know of.
[23:24.46]Hint, hint.
[23:28.02]I've played this game before.
[23:30.19]How do I get the map?
[23:34.75]That's a quick menu.
[23:35.69]Where's the map?
[23:37.26]Map is really helpful.
[23:39.38]Yep, dodge roll.
[23:41.59]Do I have an item?
[23:42.58]Can I punch?
[23:47.00]Alright, here's the entrance, yeah.
[23:52.90]Oh, give me that.
[23:54.87]Okay, red wax.
[23:56.24]Wax colored with madder, a useful ingredient in the production of spells.
[24:00.21]There's a crafting in this game.
[24:01.58]It's very, it's not like Minecraft, but I like the crafting.
[24:06.24]It's more like kind of like Resident Evil.
[24:07.82]We use combined items and stuff.
[24:13.69]There's a lot of weird characters that I will do some voices one day.
[24:20.70]Chocolate, you can eat it.
[24:21.57]It's health.
[24:28.02]You look lost.
[24:29.07]First time in the dream?
[24:31.70]I'm Becca.
[24:33.41]I'm afraid you've stumbled into something you probably shouldn't have.
[24:36.54]We're having a sort of celebration to welcome a new member of our little club.
[24:40.36]You see, we're, I thought it was, we're weirdos.
[24:43.58]We're witches.
[24:45.37]In the dreary waking world, there's no magic but here.
[24:49.59]Magic is real.
[24:52.42]Sir, it's all terribly confusing.
[24:54.77]You need to go talk to the First Witch.
[24:57.08]She's our leader.
[24:58.91]You'll find her up ahead by the fireplace.
[25:01.16]Just answer any questions she has truthfully, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
[25:07.06]Oh, and feel free to grab a slice of cake.
[25:08.87]It's delicious.
[25:11.34]Okay, very good.
[25:20.72]You are not supposed to be here.
[25:22.72]Are you a patient here at Mostyn Private Asylum?
[25:27.19]Uh, I think I am.
[25:28.68]If I remember.
[25:29.93]But I forget everything, so...
[25:31.72]Yes.
[25:34.27]Hmm.
[25:35.79]Did you come from the gatehouse?
[25:39.03]Uh... No?
[25:42.57]Liar, butthead!
[25:52.21]Welcome to Withering Rooms.
[25:55.12]No one's safe.
[25:58.47]Why did you lie?
[25:59.22]Oh, I don't know.
[26:02.95]Because I want to do my butt head thing.
[26:06.18]In a dream, the pain of the flame subsides as Nightingale loses consciousness.
[26:11.39]She awakens in a strange bedroom within Mostyn House, still in the dream.
[26:19.77]This is where shit gets fucked up.
[26:27.79]Oh I forgot how loud that was.
[26:30.47]I forgot.
[26:32.43]Hey, that's a reminder.
[26:40.03]That's a good reminder.
[26:43.38]Let's see, how bad is it?
[26:46.23]Okay, that's better.
[26:51.21]Cleaver.
[26:52.27]An old kitchen cleaver generally used for hacking through thick cuts of meat.
[26:56.79]It does 4 damage, bleeding, build up, poise, impact.
[27:01.20]Yep.
[27:02.34]Now we just have it equipped normally.
[27:05.56]And now we have a weapon.
[27:07.06]You can hold it.
[27:11.78]There's a mirror here.
[27:12.80]Who knows what that is?
[27:14.25]This is teaching you how to play.
[27:16.03]It's a pretty long tutorial, but I like it though.
[27:18.77]I enjoy it.
[27:25.83]Yeah, if you don't do anything, dodge back.
[27:28.56]Yeah, like that.
[27:29.13]You bounce back.
[27:31.14]Mm-hmm.
[27:33.20]Search the room for an exit.
[27:37.04]Is this a Souls-like?
[27:41.46]Like I said in the beginning of the stream, kind of, yes.
[27:48.34]I'm terribly sorry if I frightened you by just appearing like that.
[27:52.28]I like to observe new arrivals to make sure they're not violently deranged before allowing them out of their room.
[27:57.41]I'm Margaret Blackett, and I share administration of this asylum with my father, Dr. Robert Blackett.
[28:05.78]Your name is Nightingale, isn't it?
[28:08.14]Let me first deeply apologize to you for being set on fire as you soon... as soon as you arrived here.
[28:15.65]I assure you, the responsible party has been severely reprimanded.
[28:20.08]I'm not familiar with your case history.
[28:23.12]But you may be wondering if this is all a delusion.
[28:27.44]I can assure you it is not.
[28:28.95]You've been drawn into a phenomenon unique to Mostyn House.
[28:33.08]It's a sort of dream or nightmare.
[28:36.23]Weeks will pass here during a single night in the real world.
[28:41.33]I'm sure you have questions.
[28:42.48]I'll answer as best I'm able.
[28:46.02]Blood-born daughter?
[28:47.04]I mean, kinda.
[28:48.01]That's pretty much what we're playing.
[28:53.53]Do an auto voice.
[28:56.99]You gotta save the auto voice for one of the other characters.
[29:01.35]What can I tell you about?
[29:01.95]Teach us about magic.
[29:05.48]In order to invisibly observe you earlier, I used a spirit twig.
[29:10.68]Simply by snapping the twig in my hand, I am able to briefly move about as if I were a phantom.
[29:15.93]In the real world, magic is the Providence of charlatans.
[29:20.39]But remarkably, in the dream, magic is real.
[29:23.59]I'm a novice magic user.
[29:24.96]You'll want to seek out the filthy wretch to learn more.
[29:29.75]Okay.
[29:31.84]As those trapped in the dream, not in the real world, they turn into deranged living corpses here.
[29:37.83]Unfortunately, the dream accumulates more such unpleasant residents every year.
[29:44.43]As such, it's critical that you avoid attention until you are properly armed with the tools to defend yourselves.
[29:50.52]While dying in the dream is a temporary affair, the experience is still horrible.
[29:56.10]So be careful.
[29:58.79]How do we get out?
[30:00.46]The methodology for waking up from the dream is not well understood.
[30:03.65]Some wake with ease, with only a vague memory of what occurred here.
[30:07.45]Others are trapped indefinitely, their comatose bodies slowly rotting in the real world.
[30:12.21]Told you this is crazy.
[30:15.31]Dying in the dream provides no release, you'll simply awake anew.
[30:18.32]When do you get the Doom shotgun?
[30:25.27]Alright, that way you were close to getting banned.
[30:27.63]Because I thought you were gonna lead into, like, play Doom.
[30:30.97]But, you're alright.
[30:33.60]I'm gonna allow that one.
[30:36.30]Okay, so we need to go find the filthy, uh, wretch.
[30:40.50]The mansion reconfigures itself each night, but you should be able to find me in the study easily enough.
[30:45.46]I'll leave you with the key to this room and make my exit in a different way.
[30:50.09]Oh, and Nightingale.
[30:51.73]Don't be discouraged if you die, as you've already seen it's only temporary.
[30:55.48]It sounds perverse, but death truly is the greatest teacher.
[30:59.23]See you around.
[31:02.61]Alright, find the filthy wretch in the occult library.
[31:07.10]Meet Margaret in the study.
[31:10.44]You're going to go for magic?
[31:11.63]Chat voted magic, but it's going to be a vibes-based decision.
[31:15.67]You can view current quests in the notes.
[31:20.29]Yeah, it's a pause menu.
[31:20.99]Okay, yeah.
[31:22.22]You have a little menu here.
[31:24.73]We have a list of things to do.
[31:26.26]We have stats.
[31:27.00]There are stats in the game.
[31:28.12]There are skill points in the game.
[31:30.37]Well, stat points, right?
[31:31.62]This is how you play the game.
[31:34.49]Take notes.
[31:36.52]Yeah, and then you get like clues and all this.
[31:39.30]Alright, we gotta find the filthy wretch in the occult library.
[31:41.19]The key can be found in one of the bedrooms in a chest requiring a code.
[31:45.37]Here's the map.
[31:46.96]How do we get the map on the screen?
[31:48.32]It's actually so useful.
[31:50.40]There are the keys.
[31:51.13]There is armor.
[31:53.81]There's...
[31:54.84]Weapons, armor, everything you could want.
[31:57.13]There's potions.
[31:59.33]Yeah, hell yeah, there's stats.
[32:03.26]Alright, how do I get the mini-map?
[32:04.48]There it is.
[32:05.03]Okay, so here you go.
[32:06.86]Question mark on the mini-map.
[32:08.95]Oh, it just told me.
[32:09.63]Thank you.
[32:10.72]Question mark on a minimap means that there's something in the room that you have not picked up yet.
[32:16.94]So the room is not clean.
[32:18.12]It's not clear.
[32:19.09]So what is it?
[32:20.95]What did I not get in here?
[32:26.38]Grandfather clock, there's a key hole on the front.
[32:28.67]Okay, so that's what I don't have.
[32:35.76]Okay, anybody here?
[32:43.20]I want to buy Ark Raiders, Dying Light the Beast, and Stellar Blade, or I could get Withering Rooms.
[32:48.64]What do you suggest?
[32:49.82]Well, I suggest Withering Rooms.
[32:53.98]It's got armor.
[32:55.49]It has melee.
[32:58.01]It has scariness.
[33:02.19]Okay, blank scroll.
[33:03.05]This is where the magic begins.
[33:05.75]A blank piece of parchment perfect for crafting a spell.
[33:08.90]You have to make all your spells.
[33:11.33]So it's kind of not hard, but you can end up not having enough.
[33:15.58]Blue wax, it's a crafting ingredient.
[33:23.70]So all these are doors, right?
[33:27.66]More wax, yellow wax.
[33:29.04]It's a crafting material.
[33:32.11]Okay.
[33:33.55]Bathroom.
[33:34.23]Let's go in the bathroom.
[33:36.00]Nobody in here, right?
[33:38.15]Somebody's gonna be behind that curtain.
[33:39.96]I guarantee you.
[33:44.20]Alright, this bandage heals any bleeding buildup and the bleeding status effect.
[33:47.90]I need to put that on him.
[33:48.60]Okay, yeah, you found a healing item.
[33:49.85]Use it from the healing items section.
[33:52.34]You also can put it on the quick menu too, which let's put it on right there.
[33:58.24]So then I can go like this.
[34:00.30]Boom.
[34:06.28]Poison antidote.
[34:07.00]Yep.
[34:07.40]Let's put that.
[34:08.45]Ooh, first aid kit.
[34:10.86]Convenient kit packed with healing items.
[34:12.91]Alright, that's plus 50% health.
[34:14.27]Yeah, this is like the big one.
[34:15.16]This is the one that heals everything.
[34:21.19]Let's put that one here.
[34:22.38]And let's put this one...
[34:25.65]This is bleed.
[34:27.50]This is poison.
[34:29.35]And that one's everything.
[34:32.26]Everything, bleed, poison.
[34:34.09]Got it?
[34:36.50]Why do you have a cleaver?
[34:37.31]Aren't you a magician?
[34:39.27]This is a starter item.
[34:41.57]Alright.
[34:41.95]There could be a jump scare right here.
[34:48.67]Nope.
[34:49.07]Okay.
[34:57.53]Can I search in here?
[35:11.18]Okay, I really was not expecting that, because where did you come from?
[35:16.87]I'm so glad I actually went in here.
[35:20.75]Should I try to kill her?
[35:22.06]I don't know how weak I am right now.
[35:23.23]I'm probably so weak.
[35:27.13]They do drop items though.
[35:28.31]Oh my god, where the fuck did you go?
[35:29.87]Close this door.
[35:31.44]Close the door, close the door.
[35:35.88]It's not a horror game.
[35:40.67]The game's not a horror game.
[35:41.81]It's just a weird game.
[35:49.00]You can die really- You can get killed quickly.
[35:51.14]That's why I'm scared.
[35:52.93]Because you start- Okay.
[35:53.80]I don't want to spoil the game.
[35:55.34]Just watch.
[35:59.02]Somebody's coming.
[36:03.56]It's a suspense game.
[36:11.32]I'm gonna kill her.
[36:14.41]Alright, let's go you piece of fucking rotten shit.
[36:26.20]She's bleeding.
[36:36.62]That's huge.
[36:37.46]Okay.
[36:40.46]The filthy finger of a living corpse.
[36:45.81]Warding Candle.
[36:47.00]Oh, I forgot about this.
[36:48.07]Alright.
[36:49.33]Gradually heals curse damage.
[36:51.69]The longer one stays close to it, the faster it heals.
[36:54.38]You guys know Darkest Dungeon?
[36:56.77]How it has the stress mechanic?
[36:59.40]This game has an insanity mechanic that's kind of similar.
[37:02.81]And you go insane.
[37:03.89]And horrible, insane things happen in the whole world.
[37:06.15]Whatever.
[37:06.64]You'll see.
[37:07.38]It's my favorite game of fucking 2023.
[37:09.20]relax and then you get a little card about what they do
[37:22.18]You relax.
[37:24.23]I'm just fucking around.
[37:27.38]OK.
[37:29.85]I got three coins.
[37:33.01]So I gotta find the key.
[37:35.24]Wherever it is.
[37:37.91]Maybe I should try to kill this thing.
[37:49.11]Banquet Hall.
[37:49.77]Is this open?
[37:50.62]Alright, this one's open.
[37:55.41]Alright, there's still some old musty bread.
[38:03.00]Roll 25.
[38:03.44]Okay.
[38:03.61]So this is a heal over time.
[38:05.53]Cool.
[38:11.96]Oh, he's a ghost.
[38:17.19]I think he's a ghost.
[38:20.75]He's a ghost.
[38:22.62]Uh-oh.
[38:27.47]Does he attack you?
[38:31.69]Okay, that door's locked on the left.
[38:32.96]I can't go there.
[38:41.24]Okay, let's move.
[38:42.29]I'm gonna go... Let's go up here.
[38:50.72]Are there are chests in this game?
[38:51.95]I forgot.
[38:55.59]Oh shit, this is a code.
[39:10.35]Ow.
[39:21.40]We're good.
[39:22.51]Okay, the zombies are very easy.
[39:24.38]Don't worry about them.
[39:26.79]Alright, two coins.
[39:27.47]Cool.
[39:32.13]You just attacked a frail old man.
[39:33.99]Well, it's... People are trying to kill us.
[39:37.87]A colorless fog fell upon Naples.
[39:40.28]In the morning, the city had seven painters, 14 sculptors, and seven priests.
[39:44.30]Then two priests burned themselves alive.
[39:46.99]On the following day, each priest ripped apart two sculptors.
[39:50.35]Next, three painters jumped to their death.
[39:52.84]In Naples, only a few painters, sculptors and priests remain.
[39:56.27]Okay.
[39:58.31]That's the code for the chest right there, right?
[40:00.80]Alright.
[40:02.06]So the city had seven painters, 14 sculptors, and seven priests.
[40:05.74]Two priests are gone.
[40:07.57]So we have five priests.
[40:12.01]So there's five priests, 12 sculptors,
[40:19.62]Alright, so 4, 12, 5.
[40:20.44]4, 12, 5.
[40:30.93]Wait, did I do the math wrong?
[40:32.65]14 and a 3?
[40:33.78]That's too many numbers on the note.
[40:37.23]There's seven painters.
[40:40.66]Four.
[40:41.53]So yeah, sorry, four painters.
[40:43.36]Four painters.
[40:44.10]Four, twelve, five.
[40:51.41]Each one killed two sco- oh, each- oh, each pr- right, right, right, okay, okay, okay.
[40:56.91]Okay.
[40:59.30]Let's do it again.
[41:00.53]Seven painters, their two priests burn themselves alive, right?
[41:04.47]I didn't read each priest.
[41:06.12]I just was like, oh, these guys just like, these people just died.
[41:11.56]Okay.
[41:12.24]Seven fainters, fourteen skulls, seven priests.
[41:14.23]Two priests, burns out the last of you.
[41:15.48]You have five... You have five priests.
[41:18.53]So that's five...
[41:21.23]So 10 sculptors were killed.
[41:24.41]So that's 5-4.
[41:31.71]5-4-4.
[41:31.99]5-4-4.
[41:42.37]Wait, 5-4-5.
[41:43.74]No, 4-5-5.
[41:45.09]Fuck.
[41:47.32]4-4-5.
[41:49.38]Yes.
[41:50.51]Because I'm not accounting for the...
[41:51.94]Okay.
[41:55.06]Are you high?
[41:55.83]No, dude.
[41:56.83]What did I even get?
[41:57.54]That's a math one.
[41:59.36]I have a math problem.
[42:04.62]What did I get?
[42:05.06]What did I get?
[42:05.42]What did I get?
[42:08.55]Ooh!
[42:09.99]Ooh!
[42:12.17]Okay, I got the library key.
[42:14.06]Sick.
[42:17.83]That's good.
[42:19.26]There's something still in here.
[42:23.76]There's gonna be...
[42:31.24]A creepy doll!
[42:33.29]Place to create a distraction or draw attention.
[42:35.60]Okay, this is like a taunt dummy.
[42:40.05]It's actually very useful.
[42:44.22]Put it here.
[42:50.65]Bedroom A is clear.
[42:56.98]Okay, I got the library key.
[42:58.65]Let me clear the... No, you know what?
[42:59.77]Let's just do this now.
[43:01.48]Because this is a safe zone.
[43:07.86]The Night Mother remembers we are her bricks and blood is her mortar.
[43:14.35]I believe this is a...
[43:15.45]It's kind of like a bonfire in a way.
[43:20.50]Think this is the person that teaches you magic.
[43:26.85]Table for pressing wax.
[43:28.11]Yeah, this is where you learn spells.
[43:35.07]Oh, a new visitor to our dream.
[43:36.87]How exciting.
[43:38.64]I don't have a name, exactly, but most folks around here call me the Filthy Wretch.
[43:45.06]I consider myself a tutor of sorts in occult arts.
[43:48.71]You seem like you would make a fine student.
[43:51.27]Before we get started, I have one small request which you might find a bit off-putting.
[43:55.05]I'd like you to bring me a corrupted finger, freshly clipped from one of the undead.
[44:01.41]Now don't look so scandalized, you don't even know what it's for.
[44:04.90]I'd suggest targeting one of the sleeping zombies.
[44:08.13]I appreciate this as an unusual and difficult request, but I assure you the end result will be worth it.
[44:15.04]You can have this finger.
[44:17.69]Excellent.
[44:18.39]I won't ask where you got it.
[44:19.96]Now what I'd like you to do is eat the finger.
[44:24.37]And just wait till I hold up my iPhone.
[44:26.74]Hold on.
[44:27.13]Okay.
[44:28.73]Just want to make sure it says it's recording.
[44:32.22]Just kidding.
[44:33.49]Such body parts are a valuable commodity which may... many uses are in the dream.
[44:40.02]You see the stone shrine in this room.
[44:42.36]A curious ancient thing.
[44:43.85]Place the finger into its basin to activate it.
[44:46.52]It will help you remember items you might otherwise have forgotten each night.
[44:50.01]You'll find shrines like these throughout the mansion.
[44:53.70]Just as no two people are alike, so are the shrines.
[44:57.28]Each one will require a different offering to activate.
[45:02.00]Each new shrine you activate will allow you to remember one additional item.
[45:05.92]Return to me, pupil, once you have activated the shrine.
[45:11.22]You are allowed to keep items if you die, but you have to do this.
[45:20.55]I have a finger.
[45:24.31]Plus one item remembrance slot.
[45:28.43]manager remembered items.
[45:30.46]So, if I die, I come back, the world resets,
[45:38.46]but I get to keep something.
[45:42.39]And I think it's probably
[45:48.70]And the rest of my inventory is removed, by the way.
[45:52.11]Besides the permanent items.
[45:55.66]So I get to choose which items I want.
[45:58.93]I would probably pick, at this point, a weapon for now.
[46:06.60]because all this stuff is pretty consumable and weapons are actually very important.
[46:11.34]Very good.
[46:14.03]You need to speed up.
[46:15.32]You need to slow down.
[46:18.77]Our next lesson will be the casting of spells.
[46:21.53]You may be skeptical about the existence of magic in the real world, but there is no doubting its power in the dream.
[46:26.31]Hold this blue scroll, focus your attention on the seal and imagine it breaking while you wave your hand over it.
[46:33.25]The seal will break, and the magical energies contained within consume the scroll and escape
[46:39.36]This blue scroll is a protection spell, giving you an invisible suit of armor that will absorb a few hits before dissipating.
[46:47.02]There's a price, however.
[46:48.83]Using magic will cause one to become slightly cursed.
[46:51.81]The effects are numerous.
[46:53.84]graying of the skin and increased awareness of paranormal activity nearby, next strange and horrific sights previously hidden will reveal themselves.
[47:02.17]Everyone has a tolerance for being cursed, which if exceed leads to a rather rapid internal rotting process.
[47:10.54]In that case, use a warding candle immediately to reduce your cursedness.
[47:16.46]Enough prattle, give that spell a try and see me when you're ready to learn more.
[47:23.15]Using magic makes you kind of go crazy.
[47:25.10]And if you go too crazy, you die.
[47:29.09]Interesting.
[47:30.78]Okay, so I got that spell.
[47:33.71]You have to equip them too.
[47:34.63]Is it currently equipped?
[47:40.50]Oh I think I just have it in my hand.
[47:47.21]Become slightly cursed.
[47:48.40]As your curse level increases, strange things will begin to happen.
[47:50.96]Yeah, so see the, in the top right?
[47:54.11]I got the two bars.
[47:55.28]The blue is shield and the other bar is my kind of like stress meter.
[48:00.53]It's my curse meter.
[48:05.05]So, it gets kind of weird.
[48:08.86]To craft your own spells, you'll need a grimoire.
[48:12.61]It so happens I have an extra beginner as a Grimoire.
[48:15.40]You may have.
[48:17.20]Use the table over there to create your spells.
[48:19.61]Here's a blank scroll.
[48:21.23]You need to find some wax.
[48:22.51]The rage in the chat feeds me.
[48:33.84]Alright, so we can do, uh, we can cast a mega dummy.
[48:41.67]There's a ton of spells you learn eventually.
[48:43.31]This is Door Hex.
[48:46.59]Anyone who opens the door will be engulfed in a cloud of energy.
[48:50.53]It's like a trap.
[48:52.80]Armor spell, very useful.
[48:54.69]Adds 25 armor.
[48:55.76]I'll make a couple of these.
[48:58.33]I'll make two.
[48:58.79]How much would I have?
[48:59.41]I have enough to make one of each.
[49:05.63]Okay.
[49:07.40]That's good.
[49:15.74]I've taught you everything I can for now.
[49:17.29]To continue your studies in the occult, you'll need to find the first witch in the basement.
[49:21.46]Here is the east stairwell key.
[49:23.31]Before heading down, you might talk to Margaret...
[49:28.85]I thought someone was going to come and just grab me.
[49:31.58]Uh, she mentioned needing something from down there.
[49:36.21]Okay.
[49:37.86]Be warned that someone has tampered with the gas pipes in the basement.
[49:41.36]All the lights are out.
[49:42.52]I hate that place.
[49:44.41]Basement's not somewhere you want to be without a light.
[49:51.07]Small passageway, crawl through.
[49:54.15]Yes.
[49:58.31]Oh, this is the wretch's room.
[50:05.52]I think this is a training session, training area.
[50:10.45]Oh, wait a minute.
[50:14.95]briefly transforms the caster into a spirit,
[50:18.58]Adds a brief window of invulnerability.
[50:21.05]Oh, right, okay, so here's another thing to know about this game.
[50:23.18]There is no iframes.
[50:25.01]So there are no iframes in the game.
[50:26.69]You can craft iframes with a spell.
[50:35.61]Yeah, this is just kind of explaining more how the game works.
[50:41.21]Yep.
[50:42.71]Sound is important.
[50:46.93]Yep.
[50:57.76]You now have an equippable item
[51:02.78]Where is it?
[51:04.43]In here?
[51:04.97]Yeah.
[51:05.78]Let's put this on...
[51:09.19]uh here and then put this one on here
[51:17.63]Alright, we're good.
[51:23.92]moonless formless paths connect the past and present light this candle to open a path so long as you do not leave this room death will return you to this moment
[51:33.52]So how these work, it's cool.
[51:37.10]This is a save state that you get to have.
[51:38.93]It's kind of like a little,
[51:41.96]Just in case you die moment, it's good.
[51:47.04]Alright, because I think the reason why they do this is so you can kind of learn how to do some of these things.
[51:51.17]Maybe I can kill it.
[52:00.57]He's explaining how to save a game to us.
[52:11.80]It's like I'm talking to a bunch of people that apparently have never played a video game in their whole life.
[52:17.46]So here, this is, what I have here is I have...
[52:20.87]This is a cleaver, and people normally chop onions and tomatoes with this, but it's used in this game for combat purposes.
[52:41.07]Ow.
[52:42.44]Actually, I kind of want to just die because I don't want my shield to be gone.
[52:45.36]Oh my god.
[52:46.04]Oh my god.
[52:52.08]The tutorial monster's gonna kill me.
[52:54.54]Okay, it's alright if you die in the tutorial.
[52:58.52]If you die in the tutorial, it's alright.
[53:08.73]You now have an equipable item.
[53:12.72]I think it wants me to...
[53:16.07]What is the... the candle?
[53:18.49]No, no, no, I didn't want to do that.
[53:19.54]Actually, I kind of did.
[53:23.58]it's alright alright let's build let's beat the tutorial monster please
[53:37.10]Okay, there we go.
[53:42.82]It's R2 to, like, steady yourself.
[54:08.91]Come on.
[54:12.34]Ow!
[54:12.60]I just rolled into it.
[54:13.35]Shit.
[54:17.67]This guy's hard, okay?
[54:21.59]I'm cornered.
[54:24.46]I'm a magic user!
[54:26.76]I'm a mage.
[54:27.77]I'm a mage.
[54:31.10]He's so bad at his favorite game.
[54:32.81]This is a monster that's supposed to kill you.
[54:36.84]I'm not high, my level's not high enough for this.
[54:41.84]Is it possible to die to this?
[54:45.48]You know, hold on.
[54:51.97]Filthy mat.
[54:52.74]There's also, there's like a beam of light coming into my face.
[54:55.45]I don't know what angle it's even coming from.
[54:59.21]Like sunlight is beaming into my eyes.
[55:01.23]How?
[55:05.49]I have to like shift my body every five seconds to not get hit in the fucking face with a beam of sunbeam.
[55:27.65]Fuck you.
[55:36.40]I'm not even kidding, this is fucking messed up.
[55:51.27]I actually have to pause and do something with my blinds.
[56:03.03]Fuck, this guy, I remember this guy actually being hard.
[56:10.15]Because there's no iframes.
[56:29.54]Yeah!
[56:33.66]Hold on, give me one second.
[56:36.71]It's so annoying to be mad at the sun.
[56:42.77]Hey, what is a boss or a mob?
[56:44.77]Okay, let me explain in a second.
[57:06.69]Is that better?
[57:14.50]This is why you hate what I...
[57:16.45]I just...
[57:17.94]I want this room to be dark.
[57:28.10]in my face.
[57:30.64]It's directly into my eyes.
[57:36.99]There's nothing I can do about it either.
[57:38.55]It's the part of the window where the blinds don't hit the very edge.
[57:46.19]Prove it.
[57:47.58]I actually might just prove it, because like, it's fucking crazy.
[57:51.27]Hold on.
[57:52.24]I'm gonna prove it.
[57:53.66]I'm in a- I don't give a fuck.
[57:54.57]I'm in a tank top.
[57:55.72]Relax.
[58:30.20]This is just so people don't think I'm lying.
[58:33.73]I'm only doing this to prove it.
[58:46.30]Ow.
[58:47.85]I had to put a shirt on.
[58:51.49]Okay, you ready?
[58:51.99]I'll prove it right now.
[59:04.86]My webcam's not even plugged in!
[59:06.51]Now I gotta plug my webcam in.
[59:12.32]Hold on.
[59:28.59]My webcam is plugged in.
[59:29.96]Why is OBS not seeing this webcam?
[59:38.66]Huh?
[64:49.21]Hi guys.
[64:51.67]That was, that was, that was insane.
[64:55.69]That was the craziest things ever happened to me when I was at a computer.
[64:57.73]I'm not kidding.
[64:59.46]Um, hold on a second.
[65:03.42]What the fuck was that?
[65:05.49]Give me a sec.
[65:05.98]Let me get my all my shit.
[65:06.90]My computer was off.
[65:07.81]I had to turn my computer back on.
[65:10.54]Um, okay.
[65:12.89]So you remember how I said, why is my camera not working?
[65:16.30]It's plugged in.
[65:18.36]So it was plugged in yesterday.
[65:21.89]It was ready to go.
[65:23.06]Plugged into USB slot.
[65:24.75]It's like, okay, that was weird.
[65:26.46]So let me confirm you guys can even hear me now.
[65:30.79]Let me get this up.
[65:34.47]You guys can hear me now.
[65:35.26]Okay.
[65:36.65]So, um,
[65:40.46]I unplugged the...
[65:42.11]I was like, okay, let me just plug it back in.
[65:43.84]That's strange.
[65:44.98]So I unplugged the webcam because it's not being registered for some reason in OBS.
[65:48.48]I plug it back in, and every device turned off.
[65:54.45]My keyboard?
[65:55.40]My mouse?
[65:56.38]My microphone?
[65:58.73]My controller?
[66:00.78]and it started to play the game audio at 10,000 times volume through my monitor.
[66:08.27]instantly when I plugged it back in.
[66:11.99]I could not communicate with anybody.
[66:14.17]I couldn't do anything.
[66:15.46]I unplugged everything.
[66:23.11]I couldn't plug anything back in?
[66:28.93]I was desperately trying to be able to communicate to you guys.
[66:38.93]So I had to hold the power button down on the fucking computer.
[66:49.67]What the hell?
[66:50.57]And I look like a dickhead.
[66:53.66]I'm not plugging this back in.
[66:55.23]I'm not plugging this camera back in.
[66:58.61]It was madness over here for about two or three straight minutes.
[67:04.37]I have no idea what just happened.
[67:07.39]The scariest part was just hearing the...
[67:10.08]I was at full max volume.
[67:11.44]It was coming out of my monitor speakers.
[67:14.41]I don't even have that set to even exist.
[67:17.95]That shit is disabled.
[67:21.47]Alright.
[67:21.91]Anyways.
[67:22.41]Oh, the sun got in my eyes and it was like, what the fuck?
[67:25.73]I can't see.
[67:27.84]Okay.
[67:29.68]What the hell?
[67:33.47]I'm gonna get back in the game.
[67:35.11]Hopefully it's saved.
[67:36.18]Because I had to hard power the computer.
[67:42.49]That was horse shit.
[67:44.04]That was so stupid.
[67:44.98]That's never happened before.
[67:49.69]Okay, well, whatever.
[67:51.04]Here we are.
[67:51.55]Thanks for coming to the stream.
[67:53.84]We did the tutorial.
[67:59.23]And let me open this all back up.
[68:01.48]I just gotta get, everything's gotta get, essentially all my windows have to be put in the right places.
[68:06.55]The last couple of Windows updates, I don't know, I feel like I've had some complaints.
[68:11.95]Am I alone in this?
[68:14.02]I've had some complaints about these last few Windows updates.
[68:17.53]I feel like the last two weeks has been like, why is Windows update being weird?
[68:23.21]I don't know.
[68:28.17]Okay, give me a second.
[68:37.06]I got to get OBS back over this way.
[68:39.88]I got to get this over here.
[68:41.29]It's just all screwed up.
[68:48.91]There we go.
[68:51.86]This kind of... this happened yesterday, too.
[68:53.89]At one point, my...
[68:58.46]At one point, my audio crashed, remember?
[69:01.31]I was like, that's weird.
[69:02.38]Why did my microphone turned off?
[69:07.01]I gotta check my USB shit.
[69:08.48]That's odd.
[69:13.21]Okay.
[69:13.33]Well, we're good.
[69:15.28]Back to it.
[69:18.42]Let me just get that up here.
[69:25.73]Alright.
[69:28.61]Is the sun still in your eyes?
[69:29.94]Hey, you know what's funny?
[69:31.93]It took like 10 minutes to come back.
[69:33.57]The sun has moved.
[69:37.49]So we're good.
[69:40.09]Where are my glasses?
[69:41.65]And all that craziness.
[69:42.58]My glasses fell off.
[69:43.46]They're on the ground.
[69:46.41]They were on the ground.
[69:51.95]Okay, Withering Rooms.
[69:57.32]What was the last thing that even happened?
[70:00.37]Oh shit, I gotta go fight that guy again.
[70:01.90]Oh no I don't.
[70:05.49]I don't have to.
[70:10.83]Did I craft the spells at least?
[70:12.00]At least it put me right here.
[70:12.82]Okay, yeah, we're good.
[70:15.64]Did I put them on my bar?
[70:17.20]I did not.
[70:20.79]Okay.
[70:27.65]I should put this on here too because you have to equip it.
[70:31.99]Well, welcome back.
[70:32.88]Sorry about that.
[70:34.63]I have no explanation for you.
[70:36.28]I can't pretend like I know anything that just happened.
[70:46.56]Sulfuric acid?
[70:50.61]Did you guys even hear anything?
[70:53.26]Did you hear any sounds or did it just all- did it cut to zero?
[70:57.48]Weird.
[71:05.49]I felt so weird.
[71:06.66]I was trying, I was yelling.
[71:07.75]I was like, guys, I don't know if you can hear me.
[71:10.49]ghost in your house trying to communicate with you I'm not even kidding I was trying to do uh symbols and stuff I was like how can I communicate I was like with my phone my phone's not even logged into Twitch right now
[71:19.82]I had no way to communicate.
[71:24.35]Ooh, I got a ring.
[71:28.36]Uh... 30% damage to melee attacks from behind.
[71:31.94]That's good.
[71:33.59]Wait, I didn't look over here.
[71:37.99]This is the study.
[71:42.06]Let me put my other headphone back in.
[71:47.97]Why do you lie so much?
[71:49.89]I mean, you can choose to believe what just happened, but... Why would I just turn my computer off?
[71:59.73]Unless like I shit my pants and I'm trying to find a desperate way to make it so you guys don't think that that happened.
[72:04.48]And I'm like, okay, I got away with that.
[72:05.93]I shit my pants, but we're clean and I'm ready to go back to the stream.
[72:11.71]Alright, there's a spirit twig.
[72:17.94]Spirits cannot be seen and are completely invincible.
[72:22.88]It's kind of just like a oh shit button.
[72:25.05]Oh, hello.
[72:27.99]Mawson House, situated on a hill in Monmouth between St. Eli's Church and Bryn Bac Abbey's ruins, has a fascinating and tragic history.
[72:37.49]Built by coal magnate Alfred Mostyn in 1869, the house was initially designed as a country getaway before a series of terrible events
[72:46.88]led to it becoming the private residence of an American doctor, a cholera clinic, and finally a mental asylum.
[72:58.06]I think this is a quest.
[73:00.47]I wasn't expecting to see you so soon.
[73:02.07]I believe you'll do well in the dream.
[73:04.32]Let me give you a little gift.
[73:05.97]This is an old ring of mine.
[73:07.65]If you die in the dream, you'll lose most of your items, but some blessed items, like this ring, will survive from night to night.
[73:15.21]Now that you're acquainted with magic, I have a favor.
[73:18.70]There is a powerful artifact in the Mostyn Mausoleum that may be the key to escaping the dream.
[73:25.87]The last person seen there was the butcher surgeon.
[73:29.58]He's a repugnant man.
[73:31.08]My father hired to help with research in the dream.
[73:33.74]I've heard he was seen in the mausoleum recently searching for corpses to anatomize.
[73:39.70]He spends most of his time in the basement studying corpses in the kitchen.
[73:43.63]As you are much more able with magic than I, can you venture down there and see if you can find anything out?
[73:49.73]Be careful, he's truly an odious and unpredictable man.
[73:53.57]Also, have you taken a close look at the curio cabinet in the occult library?
[73:59.39]Lots of interesting objects in there.
[74:02.92]Okay, very cool.
[74:06.25]I can learn about her.
[74:07.96]So let's do this dream.
[74:09.53]Let's learn a little bit.
[74:14.27]Uh, what about father?
[74:16.34]My father is Dr. Robert Blackett, famed American physician turned Welsh asylum owner.
[74:22.41]Have you heard of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach?
[74:26.24]He's my father's favorite.
[74:28.33]Bach was given a near impossible task by King Frederick of Prussia,
[74:32.14]devise the accompaniment to a complicated melody on the spot.
[74:38.25]You see, King Frederick loved to humiliate visitors to his court in this way, by having them fail at something they were supposedly excellent at.
[74:46.44]Bach completed the task, much to the amazement of everyone in the room.
[74:51.38]When I first started learning how to play the piano at the age of eight, my father gave me the same challenge.
[74:55.94]In fact, it gave me that same challenge every day for four years.
[75:00.04]When finally I had learned enough counterpoint to complete the challenge, he congratulated me for taking four years to match what Bach had done in a single night.
[75:11.29]My father always aspired to match the achievements of his heroes.
[75:15.19]He just never realized that his hero was really King Frederick, not Bach.
[75:22.38]What the fuck?
[75:26.29]What a dick.
[75:29.50]I never knew my mother.
[75:30.92]I was born in China in the wake of the Second Opium War.
[75:34.19]My father says she died in childbirth, but I'm not sure I believe him.
[75:39.44]I don't think it matters.
[75:41.07]The only thing my mother gave me was this face, which was not always an asset growing up in England.
[75:49.77]How about the future?
[75:51.65]My father wishes to pursue a full-time study of the dream.
[75:54.91]As such, I'll become the only administrator of the asylum.
[75:58.32]As for the dream, who can say?
[76:00.05]It has existed for at least 18 years.
[76:02.81]I suspect it will be with us forever.
[76:06.12]Interesting.
[76:07.69]Okay.
[76:08.27]So we gotta go to the basement.
[76:17.61]We got shit to do.
[76:22.61]Ask the butcher surgeon in the kitchen about.
[76:24.63]Okay, yeah.
[76:25.12]Investigate the curio cabinet in the occult library.
[76:30.88]Anything else here?
[76:36.02]Thank you for your purchase of Ponser's Chess, a unique and exciting new take on the classic game of chess.
[76:42.84]Before we explain how each unit operates, you'll need to understand some terminology.
[76:47.91]Okay, this is just the stats.
[76:49.72]Perception, see spirits for further distance, detect more sophisticated illusions.
[76:55.46]Poise, we know what poise is.
[76:57.64]It's stun resistance, knockdown resistance, speed.
[76:59.53]You know what speed is, luck.
[77:01.16]You know what that is.
[77:02.58]It means you're double the likelihood of finding something rare.
[77:06.24]And you find more coins.
[77:13.62]Alright.
[77:15.55]Let's move.
[77:23.83]I think it's a shop.
[77:25.44]Hold on, we're not gonna do this shop yet.
[77:26.72]Spirit twig.
[77:29.02]Let me clean this place out.
[77:44.82]Shit, I don't wanna get hit.
[77:48.90]Okay, empty jar.
[77:49.60]Yeah, you can fill liquids.
[77:51.77]T is health and speed, cool.
[77:55.37]Alright, I got plenty.
[77:56.22]I have a lot of curse though.
[78:03.99]You just went sicko mode on that guy?
[78:05.28]He was just sleeping?
[78:10.61]Alright, this is clear.
[78:14.32]Facecam, please.
[78:15.36]His computer's gonna crash again.
[78:17.09]I don't- I have no idea, man.
[78:18.92]I- I- You can't explain the unexplainable.
[78:25.57]Oh my god.
[78:33.81]Die, please!
[78:42.58]Don't shoot me!
[78:43.07]Don't shoot me!
[78:43.47]Don't shoot me!
[78:43.85]Don't shoot me!
[78:44.24]Don't shoot me!
[78:44.86]Don't shoot me!
[78:45.40]Don't shoot me!
[78:47.66]Don't shoot me!
[78:53.69]I was talking to somebody in chat and I fucking did.
[79:02.58]It's fine.
[79:03.44]No, all my items!
[79:06.90]No!
[79:07.30]I need that shit.
[79:09.19]Give me the present, fine.
[79:18.83]What did the person in chat even say?
[79:20.18]Was I just talking shit to somebody?
[79:22.17]I don't even remember.
[79:23.70]Alright, well, a firework.
[79:24.66]And look.
[79:29.46]Back to one.
[79:33.32]Alright, I'm locking in now.
[79:37.02]I do have the key for the left side, don't I?
[79:40.48]The keys are permanent.
[79:44.31]Do I have the key for this?
[79:47.86]What happened with the last stream?
[79:49.33]Shit got all messed up, man.
[79:50.37]You don't want...
[79:56.56]I forgot about this guy.
[80:00.10]I can't dodge through this, by the way.
[80:03.28]Can I?
[80:10.33]I love how he stops playing the piano.
[80:16.87]What?
[80:20.11]Uh oh.
[80:33.86]Please don't fart in front of the curtains.
[80:46.19]Alright.
[80:46.91]Don't go in the banquet hall.
[80:50.40]I do not go in that banquet hall.
[80:53.50]Biggest mistake of my life.
[80:55.75]Lowish.
[80:59.91]Oh, fuck.
[81:06.95]Oh, fuck.
[81:08.26]Oh, fuck.
[81:08.85]Okay, I gotta pay.
[81:09.51]I can't just not pay attention.
[81:10.72]This is a pay attention game.
[81:23.50]What an idiot.
[81:34.41]Oh, that side swipe, you piece of shit.
[81:38.64]Okay, we're good.
[81:43.67]I didn't even see you down there might have been a lot of minus twos for that I have no idea I didn't even look
[81:49.59]Alright, here we go.
[81:50.14]I got some more coins.
[81:51.67]We're doing fine.
[81:53.18]We're doing just fine.
[82:01.68]Wait.
[82:02.95]Wasn't there something horrible in here last time?
[82:12.39]No, different version.
[82:22.16]Can I fight it?
[82:22.94]I'm gonna fight it.
[82:31.16]Thinks I have a ton of health.
[82:41.53]He just poisoned himself?
[82:51.51]It'd be great if I can get this.
[83:02.36]Alright, I'm gonna go through.
[83:06.15]No, don't go in the fog!
[83:20.85]Nice.
[83:21.24]Alright, good.
[83:24.09]Antidote.
[83:26.64]Corrupted heart.
[83:27.67]The enlarged heart of a living corpse.
[83:33.24]The dream is usually quite accurate, so why are they so hideously distorted and enlarged?
[83:40.63]Alright, it's actually good to look at what they're resistant to.
[83:45.51]They have terrible poise.
[83:47.62]So they're very stunnable.
[83:48.74]Alright.
[83:49.28]That's good to remember.
[83:50.81]Lots of money too.
[83:51.55]Seven coins.
[83:56.76]What else is in here?
[84:01.27]Ah.
[84:03.18]Ooh.
[84:08.17]I've been sitting in total silence talking to chat for 18 minutes.
[84:11.30]I thought everyone was making up bits like they were pretending to watch him.
[84:14.25]What do you mean?
[84:17.12]What does that mean?
[84:29.74]This guy's stronger than the other one.
[84:36.59]Alright, that's fine.
[84:37.34]I got the finger.
[84:38.24]Tools.
[84:44.92]There he is.
[84:46.23]Alfred Mostyn of Lancaster was born of modest means.
[84:50.11]He managed to build a coal mining empire after he was bequeathed a small plot in southeast Wales by his uncle.
[84:58.24]Like many newly rich, Alfred hoped for a more leisurely, aristocratic life for his children.
[85:04.62]So off went his twins, Peter and Priscilla, to England for a proper education.
[85:10.02]In 1869, Mostyn started construction on a country home halfway between the mine and Oxford.
[85:16.67]where Peter was pursuing a classics degree.
[85:23.46]Interesting.
[85:29.29]I've got to upgrade some stuff here.
[85:37.95]Yeah, keep the cleaver.
[85:39.02]It's the best thing to have.
[85:42.35]We did this.
[85:43.17]Oh, the enigmatic Miles Creighton, researcher into the unexplained, gave us the following five fundamental traits of spirits.
[85:51.95]typically confined to the room in which they died.
[85:55.01]I think this is the piano guy.
[85:56.88]They cannot be harmed or manipulated through the physical mechanisms.
[86:00.59]have been known to assail the living, sometimes causing paralysis,
[86:05.00]They have limited influence over the physical world.
[86:07.99]Visible only in mirrors.
[86:09.60]Yeah, so that's a ghost in there.
[86:13.40]We've been in there.
[86:14.20]We're gonna go down to the basement, which is so miserable.
[86:17.17]I need some...
[86:19.32]There we go.
[86:19.80]Give me some spells.
[86:23.54]Alright, I gotta start to lure people?
[86:29.05]Let me get my ship back to where it should be.
[86:32.13]Okay, that's fine.
[86:33.12]That looks good.
[86:33.64]I'll put the bread on here too.
[86:36.22]Now I'm gonna eat- what's my health at?
[86:37.45]My health sucks.
[86:42.00]That's good.
[86:42.49]Alright.
[86:44.18]Is that the candle?
[86:45.25]It is a candle.
[86:54.61]Alright, here we go.
[86:56.50]This is the shop, if I remember.
[87:02.49]Hold the cover off the mirror.
[87:04.71]Yes.
[87:15.45]Where is he?
[87:17.67]There he is.
[87:21.31]A sterling reproduction, wouldn't you say?
[87:23.05]Good evening.
[87:25.00]I'd introduce myself, but people don't generally wear masks if they want their identity to be known.
[87:30.33]I've been here so long I can scarce remember who I was previously anyways.
[87:35.13]I no longer have the patience to beat back the ever-growing throngs of animated corpses in this house.
[87:40.32]As such, I have become something of a merchant.
[87:43.03]I traffic in all sorts of goods, and my inventory is always changing.
[87:46.77]Alright, I need...
[87:57.65]What do you got?
[87:58.34]Puzzle Oracle.
[88:01.31]A dial made of dark stone with Roman numerals etched on its face.
[88:06.21]Oh, this is an instant caveman idiot puzzle solver.
[88:11.15]How much is it?
[88:12.33]It's too expensive.
[88:15.90]This thing is huge.
[88:17.60]I need it.
[88:18.39]25 max curse tolerance.
[88:19.73]It's a big deal.
[88:20.38]Later it is.
[88:22.79]This just does curse damage to you.
[88:26.19]just for having it.
[88:29.16]Spell toll is a giving yourself curse for doing spells.
[88:32.60]It's actually very important if I'm going to be spellcasting.
[88:38.22]I'm gonna get this for now.
[88:41.74]And then...
[88:44.68]Give me...
[88:45.95]I need one of these.
[88:47.02]How many of these do I have?
[88:48.51]Two.
[88:48.83]Okay.
[88:52.15]Alright.
[88:54.17]You're gonna curse yourself for the lulz?
[89:01.83]Oh, a pipe.
[89:02.63]This is better than the...
[89:04.08]Okay, I'm gonna save the pipe.
[89:06.31]How much damage does this do?
[89:07.83]Seven.
[89:08.63]Versus... Yeah, this is way better.
[89:11.67]I'm sorry.
[89:20.97]Let me go put this in the fountain.
[89:25.18]Because it's much better than this.
[89:29.49]There you go.
[89:30.03]Save one of one.
[89:30.71]Cool.
[89:31.09]Alright, now I gotta pipe.
[89:36.41]Chat's gonna curse you again?
[89:38.70]Did one of you do that an hour ago or whatever it was 20 minutes ago?
[89:45.89]Alright, here's the study.
[89:47.94]We're already in here.
[89:48.68]This is where, uh... What's her name?
[89:53.06]Oh, this is more about ghosts.
[89:58.01]If you sit, you heal curse damage.
[90:08.00]I didn't have any, so I didn't need it.
[90:11.37]Do you actually like games, or is it a decade plus long bit of you pretending?
[90:17.08]That would be so... No.
[90:19.87]No, I'm not... That would be so weird.
[90:24.33]Pretending to have a hobby.
[90:27.76]But isn't the whole point of liking something or having a hobby or an interest is you have an interest in it?
[90:34.27]Faking a hobby is... That's weird, man.
[90:38.42]I don't know about that.
[90:42.84]We're learning more.
[90:46.86]You play games off-stream.
[90:48.55]Yeah, I just told you, I just beat the Bloodstarved Beasts in Bloodborne.
[90:52.92]Off-stream.
[90:54.51]I do.
[90:56.19]Alright, Alfred Boston was fond of saying he was an 18th century man born in the 19th century.
[91:02.20]Thus, Mostyn House, while fitted with the latest technology like gas lighting,
[91:07.21]had a distinctly Baroque sensibility, notoriously thrifty,
[91:12.44]Alfred filled the estate with replicas of expensive paintings and plaster copies of famous statues.
[91:18.53]Upon its opening in 1871, early visitors split on whether the interior was beautiful or tasteless.
[91:25.52]While Alfred was away during the summer of 1872, disgruntled mine workers burnt his primary mirthier typhdil
[91:33.32]Tybdfil, residents to the ground.
[91:37.17]Worse still, his sister was inside and perished in the fire.
[91:41.06]having put nearly all his financial resources into the construction of Mostyn House,
[91:45.60]Alfred had no choice but to move full-time into his country house.
[91:49.83]Other terrible events soon followed.
[91:57.95]Alright, we gotta keep going.
[91:59.72]Mission right now is to get to the basement.
[92:02.23]Which, let me just check, right?
[92:06.34]Find the first witch in the basement.
[92:07.63]Ask the butcher in the kitchen.
[92:09.10]Investigate the curio cabinet in the occult library.
[92:11.80]Create...
[92:12.36]Wait.
[92:15.62]What do you mean?
[92:17.87]What is a curio cabinet?
[92:26.68]It's this right?
[92:32.14]Yeah, okay.
[92:32.85]I think she just wanted me to... Um, I have...
[92:37.31]I don't like this room because this room's scary because it has... Ooh, okay, there it is.
[92:41.23]Evasion Codex.
[92:48.70]So this is now permanent.
[92:49.62]Alright, so when I...
[92:50.70]This is...
[92:53.33]I now have iframes.
[92:55.80]Because this is where everything went to shit last time.
[92:58.67]I'm gonna leave him for now because I don't want to lose and get embarrassed a thousand times.
[93:10.74]Alright, let's keep going.
[93:18.74]It's one more room.
[93:23.24]guest bedroom.
[93:23.90]Let's do it.
[93:25.81]Oh my fucking god.
[93:34.78]Close it, close it, close it, close it.
[93:38.03]Alright, I need my heels.
[93:44.38]If you were an 1800s streamer, which period-relevant pop culture figures would you put on your Curio shelf?
[93:51.19]Um, I don't know, Alfred Hitchcock or something?
[93:58.86]Why is he running?
[94:04.78]What the hell is that little thing?
[94:10.57]Where is this guy going?
[94:17.12]Don't shoot!
[94:24.85]Alright, groundskeeper.
[94:26.02]David.
[94:29.22]Alright, got coins, I got- I need to heal.
[94:37.54]Lord Mustard, I've failed you.
[94:43.54]That's not the only thing in here, I think.
[94:50.77]No, we're good.
[94:54.49]What's up with the mirrors?
[94:57.39]Guys, what's up with the mirrors?
[95:00.93]Alright, here we go.
[95:02.23]Let's go.
[95:07.04]Basement time.
[95:07.86]Doll dress.
[95:12.56]Okay.
[95:12.88]A dress commissioned by Priscilla Mostyn for her life-size dolls.
[95:18.51]It's medium weight.
[95:19.98]You lose speed for having received 5% less physical damage minus three speed.
[95:24.27]How bad is that?
[95:34.39]How much slower am I?
[95:37.83]Hmm.
[95:41.67]It's really not that bad.
[95:45.11]Poise is really important.
[95:46.55]Yeah, I might actually use the knife.
[95:51.09]Alright, so we gotta go basement or we can keep exploring this way.
[95:53.25]Let's go though.
[95:53.70]Can we go this way?
[95:55.81]Yes, we can.
[95:59.57]Rare house entrance.
[96:03.70]Nightmother remembers where her bricks and blood is in her mortar.
[96:07.70]Okay, we can activate this with a...
[96:09.01]I got Two Fingers.
[96:09.71]Let's do it.
[96:15.45]I can have two items now.
[96:18.80]100% keeping this.
[96:29.49]Although this is kind of important too, though.
[96:36.59]These are good.
[96:38.84]I don't wanna lose this.
[96:48.95]That place down there sucks, I'm not gonna lie.
[96:55.61]I swear the church was this way, but there's only a wall.
[97:00.81]Oh, do forgive me.
[97:03.00]Sometimes I forget that I am this damnable shadow world rather than the real one.
[97:09.43]I'm Victor of St. Eli's, the nearby parish church.
[97:13.51]Or at least, it used to be nearby.
[97:16.16]Feels like it has been so long since I've seen it.
[97:19.41]Never mind all that.
[97:20.96]You've been in the house recently.
[97:22.49]Positively reeking with evil, isn't it?
[97:25.65]As a warrior of Christ, I had once thought to save the poor souls in there.
[97:30.37]Now I only wish to escape.
[97:32.89]You may think it cowardly, but spend a few more nights here and you'll see.
[97:39.66]I see you staring at my lamp.
[97:41.97]I would be happy to give it to you.
[97:44.40]But I need proof that you are a valiant warrior of Christ.
[97:47.55]and not in league with the foul beasts in that house.
[97:51.49]Bring me the corrupted heart of one of those hefty poison-spewing sheet-covered abominations in there.
[97:57.48]Yes.
[97:58.94]Excellent.
[97:59.84]You are indeed worthy of this lamp.
[98:01.17]Use it well.
[98:04.16]Alright.
[98:05.22]I have the lamp.
[98:08.12]We have left-hand items now.
[98:14.63]Thank you.
[98:15.19]What else do you have to say?
[98:19.33]Basement.
[98:20.80]The basement is absolutely boiling with sinful characters.
[98:24.32]For one, there's the first witch in her initiates.
[98:27.64]Do not under any circumstances be tempted to join her foul coven.
[98:32.15]I believe the dream is a test from God to see how we might behave given eternal life.
[98:38.36]Harnessing the power of demons to cast spells does not sound like the sort of activity that would please our Lord and Savior.
[98:45.96]Secondly, the foul butcher surgeon resides down there.
[98:49.44]A despicable man.
[98:50.32]I've seen him go in and out of the hedge maze several times.
[98:53.72]He claims to be searching Mostyn Mausoleum for corpses to anatomize.
[98:59.12]What is his real intention?
[99:01.45]I don't know but you should ask him if you see him
[99:07.91]The Mast and Hedge maze used to be one of my favorite spots for contemplation.
[99:12.25]Seems to have been hexed recently.
[99:14.49]Oh, as I simply cannot find a way through anymore.
[99:18.31]Seeing through such illusions requires one to be significantly cursed, something I personally cannot abide.
[99:25.05]Whoever is in there does not want visitors.
[99:28.18]The Mastin Mausoleum sits in the center of the maze.
[99:31.36]Perhaps whoever hexed the hedge maze has discovered something there?
[99:37.22]In the dream, spirits are tricky fellows to deal with.
[99:39.80]One cannot even see them unless cursed.
[99:42.15]And being cursed is a rather unpleasant state to be in.
[99:46.98]In the real world, I'd rely upon my trusty Bible for protection.
[99:51.54]But in the dream, surprisingly, a camera is the best weapon.
[99:55.43]They say a photograph can capture a person's soul.
[99:57.72]Well, here in the dream, that seems to be true.
[100:01.05]At least for these damnable phantoms that flit about.
[100:04.29]Cameras are rare.
[100:05.16]I did see a girl about your age with one the other night, though.
[100:08.21]She took my picture and said she was going to sell it to the man in the mirror."
[100:12.93]Absolutely off her rocker, I think.
[100:15.45]She looked hideously cursed as well.
[100:16.88]No doubt she was seeing things.
[100:21.23]Find a way to meet the man in the mirror.
[100:22.44]Alright.
[100:23.35]This place is absolutely freaking miserable.
[100:29.42]It's a maze and you have to have like full curse to even use it.
[100:33.51]Anything here?
[100:36.59]this is effectively saying hey don't even think about it don't even come here
[100:45.08]As the game picks up and progresses a little, you'll see what I mean.
[100:48.32]But, is there any items in here?
[100:51.11]Ooh.
[100:57.19]So we're not going to do that yet.
[100:58.29]We're going to go to the basement.
[101:05.90]The reason why I have the lantern... is because of this.
[101:10.90]This place is so awful.
[101:12.51]Even with the lantern.
[101:15.69]Okay.
[101:17.21]Don't die.
[101:19.15]Wrong room.
[101:21.33]Sweet Millie dead girl, I still remember the trick.
[101:24.40]Open and close any door three times, then step through to the wrong room.
[101:30.62]Right, okay.
[101:31.69]Open and close any door three times, then step through.
[101:34.82]Any door three times.
[101:43.08]How's my health?
[101:43.66]I'm gonna get full health.
[101:44.97]I'm not doing this shit without it.
[101:48.55]Eh.
[101:49.87]I kinda have dog shit heals.
[101:54.96]Mm.
[101:56.06]I'm going for it.
[101:56.61]Whatever.
[102:11.31]Somebody's being eaten in here.
[102:13.56]Wait, is that someb- no, okay.
[102:16.59]Fuck.
[102:17.52]I- I do my spells.
[102:18.78]Where are my spells?
[102:20.49]Do I don't have any armor?
[102:21.58]What?
[102:26.43]How did I not get armor?
[102:28.26]I didn't craft at the crafting table.
[102:29.93]Oh, that sucks.
[102:30.77]It's alright.
[102:34.29]I don't want this!
[102:37.79]Okay, I have to put it on.
[102:43.13]I hear something.
[102:47.51]Ooh, good.
[102:55.46]Safe zone.
[102:57.26]Coin purse, permanent treasure.
[102:58.60]A cloth coin purse dyed red with blood and powdered organs.
[103:01.85]Normally, all possessions are lost upon death in the dream, but this purse will safely preserve 10 coins.
[103:07.03]Good.
[103:14.81]dry plate for a picture with a camera can be used.
[103:17.14]Yeah, you actually can take pictures in the game.
[103:18.94]It's really fun.
[103:19.65]It's really actually really funny too.
[103:23.14]I like it.
[103:23.46]It's one of my favorite parts of the game.
[103:29.51]I got to read the typeface here.
[103:31.85]Yes, I am.
[103:34.03]Calvinist.
[103:35.19]But that's not so unusual, not compared to the occult games that Unholy Doctor and his mongrel daughter have concocted.
[103:41.56]It was not my fault that I was stricken with cholera, but it is my fault that I dragged myself from the irresistible grace of Christ into this den of debauchery.
[103:50.60]But I could not stand the putrid waste pouring from my mortal frame one minute longer.
[103:55.31]So here I am.
[104:04.47]fire damage ring.
[104:06.14]Ooh.
[104:08.41]When the wearer is over 50% cursed, a faint violet glow appears around their feet.
[104:11.90]Their footsteps become much harder to hear.
[104:15.56]Interesting.
[104:19.39]I think the gear is random as well.
[104:24.35]Not the stats on it, but where it is in the world.
[104:26.64]So that's kind of cool.
[104:27.52]Because I don't even think I saw that in my other playthrough.
[104:31.31]Oh, hello.
[104:34.60]I know what you're thinking.
[104:36.44]Why would this gentleman and his dog be locked up if they hadn't done something nefarious?
[104:41.18]Surely this man murdered someone, and his great beast of a dog dragged the body into a lake.
[104:47.37]Well, I can assure you we are merely the victims of a cruel jape no more.
[104:52.38]My name is Felix, and this is my noble hound, Horace.
[104:55.61]If you would be so kind as to fetch the rusty cage key, I'm sure we can be of great use to you.
[105:03.72]I don't have the key.
[105:10.19]Yeah, you can make poison bombs, I think.
[105:17.22]Okay.
[105:18.70]I'm afraid.
[105:19.16]That's why.
[105:29.93]Can she see me?
[105:31.86]Did she see me?
[105:33.71]Did she see me?
[105:34.94]Did you see me?
[105:35.58]Did you see me?
[105:48.47]Turn the light off, you idiot!
[105:51.96]Ah!
[105:52.32]Turn the light back on!
[106:07.83]It's a mage.
[106:13.33]Ow!
[106:13.71]Oh, that hurt a lot.
[106:14.62]That hurt a lot.
[106:15.00]I gotta go.
[106:15.40]I gotta run.
[106:16.71]Um, don't open boxes.
[106:18.34]I need to heal.
[106:26.26]Oh, you piece of shit!
[106:33.11]I have no more heals, do I?
[106:40.67]I'm dead.
[106:42.20]I'm dead.
[106:52.94]I didn't have to do it.
[106:53.62]I have to do an inventory.
[106:54.33]I have one HP.
[106:56.06]Do not fucking tell me you're going to find me.
[107:01.34]I got bread.
[107:01.86]I got bread.
[107:02.27]I got bread.
[107:02.61]I can eat bread.
[107:03.58]Okay, I have two bre- Let me put these on the bar.
[107:11.35]Okay.
[107:13.72]I got three breads.
[107:19.30]No!
[107:21.13]No!
[107:23.58]No!
[107:24.18]What?!
[107:25.33]The light was off!
[107:28.26]She just raced under and stabbed me!
[107:32.05]Oh, what the fuck, man?
[107:35.43]You gotta be kidding me.
[107:36.41]I had three breads!
[107:39.51]I could have been fine!
[107:41.65]Oh, okay.
[107:42.86]Well, whatever.
[107:46.65]Oh, shoot.
[107:49.42]Okay, well, whatever.
[107:50.61]Let's go.
[107:52.76]Go again.
[107:54.26]As they say.
[108:00.23]At least I get to keep a lot of this shit.
[108:03.02]Oh, wait a minute.
[108:07.16]Okay.
[108:13.41]Alright, they're permanent.
[108:15.15]Good.
[108:15.87]I was like, I saved that one, right?
[108:28.80]Get all the breads back.
[108:29.77]I think when the night resets...
[108:34.44]Most of the items do too.
[108:36.85]So we kind of have to go for it again.
[108:38.13]Permanent stuff is permanent, but okay, I can kill this guy very easily now.
[108:45.73]See how much I've improved since, um...
[108:53.64]He's too big.
[108:54.73]I thought he was too big to fit through the door.
[108:56.00]Oh, this is, I'm going to die again.
[109:03.79]Fuck it, I'll take you both on, I don't care.
[109:13.25]I know.
[109:13.64]What an improvement, huh?
[109:21.93]Come on, I gotta get that one little pixel right in your head.
[109:28.86]No, I don't wanna go up.
[109:40.35]Why do I hear somebody running?
[109:43.43]Alright, fuck this.
[109:46.20]Do I even have any he- I don't even have any heals.
[109:55.84]Okay, good.
[110:03.66]Alright, every three to four rooms, I have to check my bars.
[110:07.54]It's important.
[110:09.85]We are learning more about the house, though.
[110:12.35]In 1874, Alfred was invited along on a diplomatic tour of the Ottoman Empire.
[110:17.90]Seeing an opportunity to ingratiate his children to the aristocratic class, he brought Peter and Priscilla along.
[110:25.26]Peter Mostyn returned from that trip alone.
[110:28.27]Both Alfred and Priscilla died of fever in Constantinople.
[110:33.12]Having brought both his father and sister home in crates, Peter was already a broken man at 28.
[110:39.40]He lived quietly, opening Mostyn House to the occasional privileged guest traveling to or from eastern Wales.
[110:49.15]Anything else to say?
[110:49.90]No.
[110:55.51]I gotta get...
[110:56.38]I'm just going right for the basement.
[110:57.35]We're gonna craft some healing stuff.
[110:59.55]Oh, there's more of this.
[111:02.42]It's not clear how, but Peter became so enamored with two such travelers that he would end up bequeathing Mostyn House to them.
[111:10.42]They were the American physician, Robert Blackett, and his half-Chinese daughter, Margaret,
[111:16.71]Nearby Monmouth residents reported Peter looking increasingly pale and in poor health in 1880.
[111:22.57]And in 1881, Peter, the last surviving member of Alfred Mostyn's family, died suddenly of a failed heart.
[111:31.04]Although foul play was suspected, especially after his will revealed that Mostyn House was to be left to Dr. Blackett, there was no concrete evidence.
[111:41.23]You can't say Peter normally ever again.
[111:43.47]I, dude, I know.
[111:44.89]You don't think I know?
[111:50.05]Trust me, I'm very aware.
[111:52.87]Alright, what have I got for items?
[111:56.20]This is invulnerability.
[111:57.26]I gotta get it on the bar.
[112:02.53]I gotta use the dolls more often too.
[112:07.75]Alright, you know what?
[112:08.35]I'm just gonna...
[112:10.41]I need heals.
[112:11.09]We have to get items.
[112:12.66]I can't.
[112:13.34]Good, that's four.
[112:14.44]I'm just gonna take one of those and run through the basement, I think.
[112:21.21]This is good.
[112:21.93]Okay.
[112:22.85]This is new.
[112:25.98]There's this guy again.
[112:27.85]Good evening.
[112:29.03]Alright, I need heals.
[112:29.98]What is it?
[112:39.60]I have two wax.
[112:40.56]Alright, I need to go to the wax place.
[112:44.38]I want tons of armor.
[112:48.95]I don't want...
[112:49.47]I want to put that... That artifact is for certain builds.
[112:52.99]Not the one I'm doing.
[112:58.30]Take this off.
[113:01.98]Hey, is there a Discord I can send a picture of my cheeseburger to?
[113:08.79]I'm just imagining that you're sitting around, you haven't eaten it yet.
[113:13.05]You could just eat it, but you're like, I gotta send this photo to somebody first.
[113:21.53]There is an active Discord that is active during stream time, and it is deactivated on off stream time.
[113:29.57]It is a broadcast Discord for the most part.
[113:34.09]It's an inactive active Discord.
[113:36.06]Yes.
[113:39.32]That's not true.
[113:41.15]Yes, it is.
[113:45.88]It's a retired Discord.
[113:47.23]Yeah, that's a good way to put it.
[113:50.76]This just, you know, obviously we know what poison does.
[113:53.06]Poison is, oh, it slows you too.
[113:55.16]I didn't know that.
[114:01.61]Yeah.
[114:06.63]Okay.
[114:08.06]I think I'm going right for the basement after I craft some stuff.
[114:10.84]I gotta find the crafting table.
[114:13.66]Oh my goodness.
[114:15.33]This is very bad now.
[114:17.30]Oh my lord.
[114:24.58]He can't do it.
[114:30.07]He can't do it.
[114:31.28]Oh, I'm breaking the game.
[114:34.45]That was a headshot, man.
[114:37.44]You got me in... Victor?
[114:40.17]Victor, uh...
[114:45.44]Victor, uh, can you fight with me?
[114:47.63]I don't know, are you like a fightable NPC?
[114:52.39]Fuck.
[114:53.01]Okay.
[114:56.14]I thought that was him.
[114:56.85]It's the statue.
[115:09.08]Please don't shoot me right in the head.
[115:13.22]I need to craft spells!
[115:19.19]I don't want to be down here either.
[115:24.81]Don't follow me down here, please.
[115:32.84]Investigating the potential murder of Peter Mostyn, 35, and possible forged will leaving family estate to American physician Robert Blackett.
[115:41.46]Estate staff reports Peter appearing pale and sickly for nearly a full year before his death.
[115:47.03]Peter had been a severe alcoholic for seven years following the death of his father and sister.
[115:53.88]and his daughter Margaret had been living in Mostyn House for three years.
[115:58.48]Estate staff report no conflicts between them.
[116:01.46]unsubstantiated rumors of an intimate relationship between Peter and Margaret.
[116:09.98]What the fuck is going on?
[116:13.76]Can I just say screw it and run?
[116:15.75]Screw it, run.
[116:18.03]I'm just gonna do the screaming panic technique.
[116:21.88]Wait, open?
[116:25.81]Open.
[116:28.20]Three times, right?
[116:30.54]Does that count?
[116:31.00]Is this technically three?
[116:43.31]What's wrong?
[116:44.26]Oh, I'm getting cursed.
[116:50.92]Uh, I got... Oh, I recovered some items.
[116:53.71]Melee ring?
[116:57.66]Okay, okay, okay.
[116:58.85]I just want to see if there's any...
[117:00.05]I gotta go.
[117:03.51]I thought that was the only thing that could have happened.
[117:15.69]I need a candle.
[117:16.84]Do I have any candles?
[117:18.14]I don't have any candles.
[117:42.47]I'm panicking.
[117:44.22]Oh, thank goodness.
[117:47.37]Thank goodness.
[117:53.24]I'm back.
[117:54.93]And... Mirror's weird, isn't it?
[118:06.74]History of Dr. Robert Blackett.
[118:10.15]Made a fortune as a talented physician in Boston treating unusual cases.
[118:14.41]Took a trip to China in 1860, possibly to avoid war in U.S.
[118:18.89]left China for England, bringing half-Chinese daughter Margaret with him, mother unknown.
[118:25.58]Unsubstantiated rumors of heavy opium usage.
[118:29.33]Met Peter Mostyn in 1878, Robert and Margaret move into Mostyn House.
[118:34.67]Three years later, Peter dead and Robert owns Mostyn House.
[118:41.96]That's crazy.
[118:49.85]Okay, we need the key to get- wait, there's items too.
[118:54.38]Spelless- ooh.
[118:55.72]How many rings can I have on?
[118:57.13]Spell toll is when you cast a spell.
[119:00.62]Okay yeah, you can have four rings on.
[119:05.63]It says max health, bleed resist, max curse, more damage from behind, and less belts.
[119:12.89]I knew you were going to do that.
[119:15.30]Dick.
[119:20.35]Alright.
[119:21.58]Portal to nowhere.
[119:32.99]It's my favorite song on the OST, by the way.
[119:41.68]Who are these weirdos?
[119:50.22]Oh, now you look familiar.
[119:53.17]No, I suppose not.
[119:55.01]Haven't had a visitor in a while.
[119:57.04]I guess I am overexcited.
[119:59.48]My name is Rose.
[120:01.21]I don't remember much else but my first name.
[120:03.60]So that will have to do.
[120:05.45]Don't take this the wrong way.
[120:07.50]But you seem like the type of girl who carries around a lot of junk she doesn't need.
[120:12.43]I love junk.
[120:13.93]It's the only thing keeping me sane in this starry purgatory.
[120:18.79]Well, somewhat sane.
[120:20.11]Better than Mr. Photographs over there, at least.
[120:23.32]I got a heaping mound of coins.
[120:25.49]If you have any extra items, I'll happily take them off you.
[120:30.21]Yeah, you can sell items here.
[120:31.26]I'm going to sell this.
[120:31.91]I don't want this.
[120:39.56]I kind of need everything, don't I?
[120:41.22]Although, I'm totally just gonna die.
[120:42.39]Would you ever want to live in the Victorian times?
[120:46.86]Absolutely not.
[120:49.40]Uh, the only time I truly would want to live is in a time with modern plumbing.
[120:57.53]How far back you gotta go from modern plumbing?
[121:02.12]That's where I would... that's it.
[121:06.76]Anything before that, I would like to, uh, fly over with a helicopter.
[121:13.07]You know what I'm saying?
[121:14.52]I'm talking like hover down with a helicopter and have binoculars and look around like, whoa, dude, look at that castle.
[121:20.76]That's huge.
[121:22.89]And then get us the fuck out of there.
[121:29.61]Yeah, I'd want to visit hovering over with a helicopter.
[121:38.01]They wouldn't be able to get rid of you.
[121:40.21]Oh, but what if they freak out and come after you?
[121:42.98]Are you going to load the trebuchet to shoot at the helicopter?
[121:45.85]Good luck.
[121:47.28]Although somebody could get like a Call of Duty frag movie moment and holy shit, they would be legendary.
[121:54.18]If they actually led that shot far enough,
[121:57.27]and you actually got the hit, that would be legendary.
[121:59.88]They definitely want to put that in the montage.
[122:03.72]I hope that somebody would be recording it.
[122:06.68]Oh, no, no, somebody would be writing a song about it.
[122:09.09]Dude, I can't, if somebody would, you know, the songs that will be sung about that one.
[122:13.41]And the song montage.
[122:20.25]Picking the perfect look from a giant pile of outfits and rings takes time.
[122:23.95]To instantly recall your best ensemble, you should write it down in this fashion record.
[122:28.74]I used to have more records, but I've given them all out.
[122:31.63]Maybe you'll find them.
[122:33.06]Multiple records means multiple looks at your fingertips.
[122:36.40]fashionable young women like us need all the help we can get.
[122:47.27]A new arrival.
[122:49.08]It's been a while.
[122:51.03]I'd introduce myself, but I'm afraid I've... forgotten who I was.
[122:56.28]One visitor gave the honorific Lord Nobody of Nowhere.
[123:00.07]I quite like that time.
[123:02.89]I'm afraid to find out who I was before.
[123:05.38]Perhaps I wasn't a good person.
[123:08.67]I still faintly remember things, smells, tastes, an uncanny sense of having seen something before.
[123:15.69]That's why I enjoy photographs.
[123:18.04]They bring back so many feelings.
[123:20.68]Have you ever used a camera?
[123:22.57]It's quite simple, really.
[123:24.48]If you'd like, I have a beautiful antique camera for sale.
[123:27.53]I'd give it to you for free, but I need coins.
[123:30.88]You see, I cannot leave this place.
[123:33.19]So I purchased photos from budding photographers such as yourself.
[123:37.24]As such, you'll be able to make back the purchase price of the camera in no time, I'm sure.
[123:46.43]Hey, look at this camera.
[123:50.40]I'll take it.
[123:55.16]Say, since you have a camera, I've got a favor.
[123:57.87]My photo collection is sorely lacking photos of the supernatural variety.
[124:01.84]Sell me a photo of a spirit and I'll throw in a special extra gift.
[124:06.85]They normally can only be seen when you're cursed, but you can take a picture of them anytime.
[124:14.61]Okay.
[124:16.20]The camera is an equippable weapon and it is very good and it's very cool and I love it.
[124:24.00]I'm gonna get it on the bar.
[124:27.67]I'm gonna have a weapons tab, which is gonna be two.
[124:31.84]Look at how awful this is.
[124:32.91]I gotta redo this whole thing.
[124:44.35]Alright.
[124:44.69]It's going to be... Let's do pipe up here.
[124:47.82]Camera here.
[124:49.32]Camera down.
[124:51.05]This is going to be attacks.
[124:52.77]This would be utility.
[124:56.70]And then... How do I remove something?
[124:58.77]There we go.
[125:03.22]Okay.
[125:05.64]That's better.
[125:06.47]Alright.
[125:06.69]And then I'll add more.
[125:07.74]Maybe put the dolls here too.
[125:13.66]Yeah, I'll put dolls.
[125:16.78]This is kind of combat oriented, right?
[125:22.43]And then I'll do a healing.
[125:23.68]This is going to be heals and it's already there.
[125:26.98]Get rid of this.
[125:29.03]Yeah, clear this whole thing up.
[125:32.39]Uh, can I clear everything?
[125:33.96]I guess I could just do this.
[125:43.21]I don't have any other heals than that.
[125:46.89]That's annoying.
[125:50.19]I think that's fine.
[125:52.32]Heals.
[125:53.70]Combat.
[125:54.83]And then this next one will be spells.
[125:56.83]But I don't have any spells right now.
[126:00.22]Alright, I gotta take pictures.
[126:01.30]I have to... Yeah, be careful.
[126:04.95]I don't want to accidentally take the photo.
[126:06.50]I forget how you do it.
[126:11.44]Can I die?
[126:12.36]I can't remember if you can fall.
[126:20.28]I'm not gonna sell anything else yet.
[126:23.68]I am gonna do this though.
[126:32.50]Dude, I kinda want a coffee.
[126:33.75]Should I make a coffee?
[126:42.15]It's where you see your stats and everything.
[126:48.69]Hey, look at another one.
[126:49.56]Okay, it's one coin.
[126:50.56]Activate.
[126:52.73]Um... Definitely one of the... one of these.
[126:56.15]Spell Toll.
[127:01.56]If I'm not doing melee for long term, then why do I care?
[127:08.43]Alright, let's go.
[127:11.70]So, the mirrors are your traveling
[127:17.74]Once you unlock a mirror, you're able to travel to it.
[127:20.31]That's why I've been taking the drape off the mirrors.
[127:25.77]So that's pretty cool.
[127:28.44]Play TF2 and then somebody's bat-chesting.
[127:40.62]Alright, well, I'm not going to play TF2 right now.
[127:45.23]When are they doing the man versus machine update?
[127:47.36]I keep hearing about that.
[127:48.38]It was like three to four months ago.
[127:50.03]It was like, here we go.
[127:51.54]Man versus machine.
[127:52.44]It's going to be huge.
[127:54.31]Where is it?
[127:55.39]What happened to it?
[127:59.78]It's just gonna, whenever it shows up.
[128:04.27]It's coming out tomorrow.
[128:07.56]It's not coming up tomorrow.
[128:08.76]Alright, so I need to go down to the basement.
[128:11.43]Thankfully, I have a mirror in the basement.
[128:12.86]That's good.
[128:13.90]I just unlocked it.
[128:15.15]And I believe this is a permanent unlock.
[128:17.78]So that's big.
[128:23.08]I don't have any heals, do I?
[128:24.79]No.
[128:26.95]I got this fucking accordion in my hands.
[128:29.12]It's not gonna help me.
[128:31.07]That is, though.
[128:33.48]Uh, what?
[128:34.08]Hold on.
[128:41.86]How is the pipe better than the axe?
[128:44.74]The axe's bleed buildup?
[128:46.85]Poise impact.
[128:51.21]I guess it's just worse, but bleed.
[128:54.54]Let me try it.
[128:58.51]This thing is slow.
[129:04.78]I guess it's not that bad.
[129:06.17]Pipe is better, though.
[129:09.95]Maybe I should sell it.
[129:11.92]Alright, let's go.
[129:15.12]Brass telescope allows one to see across the room
[129:23.36]Hey Jerma, I made my cat, um, feeder...
[129:27.82]I made my custom cat feeder sound you.
[129:30.29]So my cat is now conditioned to you to eat?
[129:38.39]It's to the teacher noise.
[129:40.93]Alright, that's so dumb.
[129:51.34]What's in here?
[129:51.98]I need...
[129:56.88]I need a crafting table.
[130:01.09]Whatever monster is here, I'm just running from it.
[130:05.78]Okay, this is where that witch was.
[130:09.78]Oh god.
[130:10.77]No, don't hide.
[130:11.49]Don't be a coward.
[130:12.18]Play.
[130:13.54]I gotta go.
[130:14.43]There's no handle on that.
[130:21.61]Mm-hmm.
[130:37.93]I don't know what I just...
[130:38.59]I just got a ring.
[130:43.53]Oh, okay.
[130:43.95]Thank God.
[130:44.56]Alright.
[130:45.58]Laboratory.
[130:52.71]You can only use the mirror when you're cursed as well.
[131:00.57]You must be Nightingale.
[131:03.53]I've heard wonderful things about you from my daughter, Margaret.
[131:07.68]I'm Dr. Robert Blackett.
[131:10.34]I do apologize for not coming to visit you sooner.
[131:13.62]Oh, I see you staring at my head wound Nothing to worry about I cut my head open on a low doorway We old men bleed so easily
[131:24.18]I'm afraid you caught me at a bad time and I must be heading upstairs.
[131:28.16]I'm sure we'll have plenty of time to get acquainted here in the dream.
[131:32.81]For now, feel free to use my laboratory.
[131:35.78]You seem like a clever girl, so I'll let you borrow my basic lab manual.
[131:39.87]Enjoy the rest of your evening, Nightingale.
[131:48.65]What?
[131:49.28]Dude, what was that?
[131:53.18]Alright, I can make stuff.
[131:55.96]You can do a jar throw build if you do ranged.
[132:02.10]This is acid damage.
[132:04.50]This is health potion.
[132:06.91]Yeah, definitely.
[132:10.12]This is a paralysis.
[132:11.09]We'll do one healing potion and one acid potion.
[132:20.71]I think that's everything.
[132:21.53]Wait, this is case notes.
[132:25.05]The autopsy has ruled Peter's death as alcoholic cardiomyopathy, although the performing doctor notes some irregularities.
[132:33.42]The transfer of Mostyn House to Robert Blackett following Peter Mostyn's untimely death is suspicious.
[132:38.69]However, given all of Peter's immediate family is deceased, it is not so unusual as to be implausible.
[132:44.15]It is this officer's opinion that this investigation should be closed.
[132:53.18]those acid poison things are amazing and then healing I just got a healing potion and
[133:03.98]and then put these candles up here too.
[133:06.06]You're going to see how important these really are eventually here.
[133:11.20]Okay.
[133:12.05]Combat 1.
[133:12.67]No.
[133:13.90]Healing 1.
[133:15.23]Combat 2.
[133:19.00]Why did I put that there?
[133:22.07]What am I, stupid?
[133:32.11]Oh, I have two combat things.
[133:35.47]What am I doing?
[133:42.09]That's better.
[133:44.65]Okay, that's fine.
[133:51.30]I want to drink that health potion right now.
[133:57.34]Nobody there, right?
[133:59.96]Okay, keep going.
[134:07.35]Wine cellar, go.
[134:09.64]Any opportunity where you're not going to get killed is a good opportunity.
[134:14.69]Curse ward ring.
[134:17.89]Less curse damage.
[134:20.25]Plus five speed ring.
[134:21.63]Move on.
[134:26.47]Okay, I have four rings on.
[134:30.72]Alright, curse tolerance versus actual curse.
[134:40.46]Get rid of that one.
[134:41.64]The melee one's useless for me right now.
[134:45.92]I'm not hitting anybody from behind.
[134:49.60]What else you got?
[134:54.50]Oh, nice.
[134:58.65]Nice.
[135:02.23]And we found the first witch.
[135:08.30]Nightingale, I'm sorry for our earlier misunderstanding.
[135:12.38]I'm the first witch, and I run the Soronal Order of the Initiated.
[135:17.41]The filthy wretch and I...
[135:18.88]through careful and often perilous experiments have come to understand much about the dream.
[135:23.90]I bestow this knowledge onto worthy young initiates such as yourself.
[135:27.62]How do we train you?
[135:28.97]This will sound a bit macabre.
[135:31.74]The blood and vital organs of the dreams inhabitants hold tremendous power.
[135:35.67]By offering them in ritual to the entity that controls the dream, the body may be permanently strengthened.
[135:43.87]Additionally, worthy initiates are given special gifts as they ascend in the ranks.
[135:48.84]In fact, you will receive a special gift after your very first offering.
[135:52.66]Here is a hunting guide and an offering list you can refer to.
[135:56.32]I look forward to working with you to unlock your full potential.
[136:01.74]Okay.
[136:02.73]This is how you level up.
[136:04.16]I'm short two coins.
[136:09.14]Well, shit.
[136:14.13]I'm gonna go sell some stuff.
[136:15.05]I'll be right back.
[136:17.77]I need to be cursed though.
[136:20.46]Is there a mirror in here?
[136:21.51]There is.
[136:23.41]What is that artifact?
[136:30.42]Do I not have that artifact?
[136:37.16]Shit, I need to be cursed.
[136:41.40]Play Look Outside in a year?
[136:42.83]Dude, I've... You don't know how badly I would love to do that right now.
[136:48.20]That's why I'm happy to do this because that means I can do that a year from now, right?
[136:57.45]What's in here?
[137:01.55]Alright, there was a two, that's a seven.
[137:03.38]There's gonna be a thing to unlock.
[137:05.07]Okay, I got coins.
[137:06.61]Somebody's coming.
[137:07.47]Sweet Millie, dead girl, in the dark I can almost see her.
[137:12.48]Our number game.
[137:14.15]West to east in white lead.
[137:16.76]The other two are where we laid our heads.
[137:20.31]Okay.
[137:22.00]West to east.
[137:23.14]So there's numbers across here.
[137:25.55]There was a two somewhere.
[137:26.43]There's a seven.
[137:28.05]The other two are where we laid our heads.
[137:32.01]Alright, so.
[137:35.39]Throwing a fucking jar at this guy.
[137:47.52]I still took damage.
[137:54.60]Yeah, I'm thinking about maybe even doing jar-based combat for this build.
[137:59.22]A set of French pins that can be used to fold the hair under itself.
[138:02.94]Ooh.
[138:04.51]Put that on.
[138:15.04]Okay, west to east in white lead.
[138:17.97]So this is seven.
[138:18.76]Where is this one?
[138:19.34]This one's probably the first one.
[138:26.82]Jar build.
[138:28.10]Yeah.
[138:29.93]Yep.
[138:31.88]We got lore to read.
[138:35.64]Each night I explore the boundaries of his magnificent and horrifying gift.
[138:40.35]I am eternally grateful to Dr. Blackett.
[138:42.55]Though he claims he does not believe in God, it is plain he has been chosen to do his work.
[138:49.63]Clumsily, the previous inhabitants of the house exposed the dream to magic.
[138:55.13]Cosmic concepts have been cloaked in the false vocabulary and childish schedules of the 17th century charlatans.
[139:04.40]It will take decades of study to properly harness this magic.
[139:07.34]Thankfully, I have plenty of time.
[139:14.64]Alright, this one's seven.
[139:21.33]Just gotta go in.
[139:26.20]Was somebody in here?
[139:28.02]Oh my god, get out!
[139:29.68]Seven.
[139:30.30]That was seven?
[139:31.27]Don't move.
[139:32.13]Holy fucking moly.
[139:34.61]Do I have any jars?
[139:35.84]I'm gonna put this down.
[139:43.65]There's gotta be items in here.
[139:46.61]Give me this!
[139:47.23]Okay, I got a scone.
[139:47.86]I'm fine.
[139:56.51]I think I have to take that heal.
[140:04.51]I do.
[140:08.03]It's fine.
[140:11.23]Scone is only like 20%.
[140:13.80]Ooh, what's this one?
[140:16.11]Yeah.
[140:22.61]Spell toll, curse tolerance.
[140:31.20]Probably this one.
[140:32.97]Less curse build up.
[140:34.64]Although if I'm going to do jar build, I know you guys picked magic, but I'm going to defy all of you and level up.
[140:44.94]There are multiple places to level up.
[140:52.92]This is one of them.
[140:55.35]So it's either health, curse tolerance, or...
[140:57.69]I usually just do health.
[141:03.15]I'm...
[141:12.73]I'm very glad you experienced it.
[141:17.15]It is a...
[141:18.21]I would call it a hidden gem, but there's a lot of people that like this game, so...
[141:22.71]It's very good.
[141:23.63]The story is cool.
[141:25.28]It's got a very interesting story, as we'll see.
[141:28.53]It's just kind of fun.
[141:29.27]It's kind of scary.
[141:30.60]I like it a lot.
[141:36.68]Go put it all into decks.
[141:38.56]Um, no, I'm gonna do...
[141:40.79]I'm just gonna do health.
[141:43.44]Hey, I got to level one.
[141:49.17]How long have I been streaming for?
[141:50.65]Dude, like an hour and 30 minutes and I got to level one.
[141:55.45]Everybody, clap for me.
[141:59.49]The key that unlocks our network of secret passages.
[142:02.87]The bookshelf in this room connects directly to another part of the house.
[142:06.17]Very convenient.
[142:08.02]Your next reward will be at level 5, an advanced Grimoire that will let you create new spells.
[142:17.25]Alright, I need fingers and coins.
[142:21.46]If you find yourself running out of foes to harvest, you need to begin a new night.
[142:26.51]All of your targets will be revived and be hunted once more.
[142:30.81]Dying is one way to start a new night, but it comes with obvious downsides.
[142:34.11]Search for another blue bookshelf and you might find another way.
[142:45.26]Can you please say it with us?
[142:47.52]Grim Moi.
[142:50.46]Grimoire.
[142:52.48]Grimoire.
[142:53.37]That person had it so wrong.
[142:54.75]Grimoire?
[142:57.43]Time that person out for being so incorrect.
[143:00.05]Grim moi.
[143:03.52]Grim war.
[143:04.44]Yeah, whatever.
[143:05.75]Grim war.
[143:07.09]Grim war.
[143:09.42]Grim war.
[143:10.76]Grim war.
[143:12.03]Grim we're.
[143:16.17]What would, how do you say it?
[143:18.03]Grim war.
[143:19.62]Grim weir.
[143:23.97]W-A-H-R. Grimoire.
[143:29.71]Grimoire.
[143:32.46]I was once a stranger to the dream like you.
[143:35.23]My title is accurate.
[143:35.98]After learning the occult arts from the filthy wretch, I became the dream's first true witch.
[143:41.50]I believe I am still alive in the real world, although it becomes harder and harder to know for sure.
[143:46.50]Doesn't matter to me because I have so much important work to do here.
[143:50.47]The filthy wretch and I are collaborating on an experiment of sorts.
[143:55.00]Through careful application of offerings of blood, permanent changes can be made to the dream.
[144:01.28]We're still early in our research.
[144:03.77]But I'll be sure to let you know how we get on.
[144:07.21]Okay.
[144:09.50]Find another bookshelf secret passage.
[144:13.09]Is there one in here?
[144:18.02]You know what?
[144:19.03]I'm gonna make a coffee.
[144:22.39]I'm making a coffee.
[144:29.89]Okay, now we're up in here.
[144:31.12]Wait, this is...
[144:34.24]Oh, this is in the...
[144:37.86]Cool, alright.
[144:40.43]Well, I know where this goes now.
[144:43.65]Because this is the actual first area.
[144:48.41]Let me loot this place.
[144:49.28]Hold on.
[144:50.40]And then I'll make a coffee.
[144:54.62]I'm gonna kill this motherfucker in here.
[144:59.52]Item run.
[145:06.20]Good item run.
[145:19.12]Don't.
[145:20.01]Don't.
[145:20.72]What are you doing?
[145:26.25]Okay, good.
[145:28.26]No finger?
[145:29.23]I could level up again if I get another finger.
[145:36.71]Because it had relatively modern plumbing, gas lighting, and plenty of space, Mostyn House was reopened as a private cholera clinic in 1883.
[145:45.40]received the occasional wealthy guest but keeping the house clean and running was too expensive for the operation to turn a profit and ultimately was shut down just five years later
[145:54.88]In 1888, the Blacketts joined the burgeoning private asylum business, which was a smashing success.
[146:04.70]Gentry from the Midlands pounced on the opportunity to send their troublesome children and misbehaving wives to Mostyn Private Asylum for rehabilitation in the beautiful estate
[146:14.69]Would they still be so eager if they knew the dark history of the house?
[146:20.22]They probably would.
[146:26.12]Would you live in a house with gas lighting for all the fixtures?
[146:29.87]Nah, dude, I don't want anyone, like, telling me something and then fucking, you know, pulling the rug from me into making me believe something else.
[146:35.03]I don't care if it's the chair I'm sitting in.
[153:45.44]I have returned.
[153:49.95]How are we?
[154:00.22]Says you're getting, uh, you said you're getting coffee, but it says you're getting tea.
[154:04.47]Somebody needs to be fired over this blunder.
[154:08.90]I drink a lot of tea too.
[154:17.69]Now I gotta play the game of trying to put my headphone in correctly.
[154:24.51]Because they don't color code it.
[154:26.54]They etch it in a tiny, unreadable font of what ear it's supposed to go in.
[154:34.03]Oh, look.
[154:35.65]It says L. Let me get a microscope to find that out.
[154:41.54]Just color code it.
[154:50.04]Have, I don't know, right be like green and left be the blue.
[154:54.72]It doesn't matter.
[154:58.16]just so I know left means green.
[155:00.15]And I painted a little thing on it, but the paint comes off because I'm a sweaty man.
[155:09.99]That doesn't go with my outfit though.
[155:12.50]I'm not looking for an outfit.
[155:13.57]I'm looking for practicality.
[155:18.15]You can have your outfit headphones, then you can have your practical desk headphones.
[155:30.67]Okay.
[155:31.80]Let's continue.
[155:32.82]I got it.
[155:36.16]Both headphones have to be in audio is a big deal.
[155:41.93]Does the paint go on your brain?
[155:48.00]Hey, you're my favorite streamer.
[155:49.25]Would you want to change that?
[155:51.55]That's up to you, not me.
[155:54.52]That is for you to decide.
[155:55.54]I have nothing to do with that.
[155:58.79]If you don't like me, you don't like me.
[156:00.42]That's up to you.
[156:04.09]I don't care.
[156:05.72]I don't even care.
[156:08.85]But if I did care, what do I care?
[156:13.79]I'm gonna, like, beg and grovel to keep you, like, a fan.
[156:18.26]I don't care.
[156:19.36]Just do I sound like I even care?
[156:20.53]I give a shit?
[156:25.69]I don't even care.
[156:34.12]Please don't go!
[156:38.23]Alright, let's make them spells.
[156:41.14]This spell is amazing and I want it.
[156:44.91]Finally.
[156:52.65]Amen.
[157:01.34]Alright, do I want to be a spell Andy or do I want to do throw jars at people?
[157:06.74]I think I already know the answer to that question.
[157:09.87]Am I just gonna completely veto the vote?
[157:22.74]Let me turn that spell on, by the way.
[157:28.83]There we go.
[157:30.02]Okay.
[157:31.82]Spell is actually very useful.
[157:36.05]That's it.
[157:40.19]Somebody was in here, right?
[157:41.33]Oh my god!
[157:42.48]Where did you come from?!
[157:43.94]Where did he come from?!
[157:44.79]Where did they come from?!
[157:46.83]!
[157:53.12]Were they both in the room just standing at the doorway?
[158:00.49]He shot this guy.
[158:01.78]He killed...
[158:02.41]I didn't do that.
[158:03.13]I think he killed this guy.
[158:11.14]Hey, your viewer count number is the same upside down.
[158:14.57]Is it?
[158:16.12]8698 upside down is eight of you know me flip that is funny 8698 what the fuck
[158:27.88]Wait, is that person wrong?
[158:36.87]I think the person is just wrong.
[158:43.03]I'll take the free items.
[158:48.86]Alright.
[158:49.30]Am I ready for the basement again?
[158:50.34]I think so.
[158:55.15]Cast that spell again.
[158:56.17]Alright.
[159:03.12]Don't screw this up.
[159:10.27]There's a slug person.
[159:30.13]Just hit him in the head, bash his fucking skull in.
[159:40.73]Okay.
[159:44.44]It's new meat.
[159:47.54]It's gross because that's a real photo.
[159:51.29]The dev just got like the grossest piece of shit meat ever.
[159:55.91]What kind of meat is that?
[159:59.04]Is that just like a steak that was like left in the fridge for a week or two?
[160:07.49]It's like, it's human.
[160:09.55]What does a snake even look like?
[160:14.04]A1 Wagyu Rotten, in parentheses.
[160:24.00]Okay, they're resistant to everything.
[160:32.41]I think I'm gonna throw shit.
[160:39.10]Oh, Alfred, I'm sorry.
[160:41.74]Oh, a skull.
[160:53.32]Alright.
[160:54.02]The big ladies out here.
[160:57.36]I'm gonna try to kill the big lady.
[160:59.29]How much health do I have?
[161:01.36]Well, let's...
[161:02.00]I gotta fix this shitty inventory that I have right here.
[161:12.34]Okay.
[161:14.85]I'm going for it.
[161:22.45]Am I gonna regret?
[161:23.11]I'm gonna regret this, aren't I?
[161:28.62]I could put a doorway trap.
[161:29.82]Let me do this.
[161:37.52]Okay, so anybody that goes through this door is gonna get hurt.
[161:44.14]It's me included.
[161:47.81]I thought it was enemies.
[161:49.38]Oh, fuck.
[161:50.65]I need to...
[161:51.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[161:56.47]Ah.
[161:59.51]I, it's, it can hurt you too.
[162:01.37]I thought it was, I thought it was enemies.
[162:03.64]This guy sucks.
[162:05.44]I, don't you come to my stream when I'm playing my favorite video game.
[162:10.83]I'm fine.
[162:11.69]Look, it didn't even happen.
[162:17.00]I lost all...
[162:20.57]Oh, shit.
[162:28.71]Should I take a picture?
[162:30.32]Wait, Taunt Doll.
[162:41.54]Put it down!
[162:41.93]Put it down!
[162:43.89]Yeah!
[162:48.26]Just give it back if it's not gonna work.
[162:54.72]Ohhh, in here.
[162:57.98]You can't come in.
[162:58.64]I can make more potions, I think.
[163:03.52]I have material.
[163:06.20]Yep.
[163:06.82]Alright.
[163:08.46]Health potion, health potion.
[163:11.65]Poison?
[163:13.36]More acid poison for sure.
[163:15.51]Just make it all.
[163:16.93]Yeah.
[163:18.26]I'm gonna have a whole inventory of just throwing shit.
[163:28.81]Yeah, this is the throwing shit inventory.
[163:38.24]Okay, so this is poison, paralysis, acid.
[163:50.36]I'm gonna throw acid at her.
[163:53.81]OK, I want the whole.
[163:56.73]Still, are you out here still?
[163:59.00]Yeah, you are.
[164:00.46]Oh my god!
[164:11.12]I didn't throw it!
[164:11.88]How do you throw?
[164:12.74]I forgot.
[164:13.41]Like this.
[164:17.13]I'm hitting myself with the acid!
[164:23.00]Hold on.
[164:37.21]Wait.
[164:39.32]Okay, I'm ready.
[164:48.93]Don't dodge, Roll!
[164:50.54]Don't!
[164:51.02]Wait!
[165:00.48]Eat.
[165:10.11]Fuck you.
[165:12.00]Oh, that worked!
[165:17.70]Just free hits.
[165:22.43]Where are you?
[165:29.86]Die!
[165:30.28]Alright.
[165:31.34]Okay.
[165:31.46]We're fine.
[165:33.05]None of this is real.
[165:33.61]You took too much THC and you had a mental break.
[165:36.80]This would be a very detailed...
[165:41.30]Uh, mental break.
[165:46.80]Okay, everything's fine.
[165:48.44]I got a new offering.
[165:51.34]Initiate.
[165:57.33]I forgot how panic-inducing this game can be.
[166:00.77]It was a lot of shit.
[166:08.40]There's still more in here.
[166:10.25]Alright, we got a 2.
[166:11.37]It was 7-7-2?
[166:12.84]There was a 7 in that other room.
[166:19.65]I think it was 772.
[166:20.65]There's still somebody out here.
[166:30.28]Whatever, let's go.
[166:38.92]That's fine.
[166:39.34]You have like three hits left.
[166:54.33]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[167:03.09]Corrupted liver.
[167:07.87]Giant Maid.
[167:09.13]Tara.
[167:12.25]That fire resist is terrible.
[167:17.55]A lot of money.
[167:21.01]Alright.
[167:21.27]Now that that's clear, I can actually take my time for a second here.
[167:26.61]I want to get the items that I may not have gotten.
[167:28.84]No?
[167:32.98]Did I get everything?
[167:36.57]Chat be normal about the giant maid.
[167:51.20]Ooh, dinner roll.
[167:54.75]Okay.
[167:56.58]So, this is the second part.
[167:59.49]This is the servant's bathroom.
[168:02.37]And then what's over here?
[168:04.92]Okay, that's the kitchen.
[168:06.13]I kind of remember that.
[168:08.26]Kind of.
[168:15.43]Don't even tell me.
[168:17.40]Yep, I see you.
[168:19.72]I got any shit I can throw at you?
[168:22.89]Acid.
[168:24.30]No, wait, was he resistant to poison?
[168:26.55]Just do parrot for losses.
[168:41.56]Oh my god, there's a second one!
[168:45.64]No!
[168:57.13]Get in here.
[169:01.18]Oh, zoinks, school.
[169:07.58]Fuck it.
[169:08.47]Chase me this way.
[169:15.85]Damn.
[169:16.92]Okay.
[169:17.58]I got a lot of money.
[169:28.37]So what was in here?
[169:35.16]Inspect the toilet.
[169:36.24]Reach into the toilet.
[169:37.47]Yes.
[169:41.23]Oh, I got the key.
[169:42.11]Okay, good.
[169:45.99]I should probably use that.
[169:46.77]Yeah.
[169:52.50]Excuse me?
[169:53.04]The fuck is that?
[169:56.48]Was that bad?
[170:02.40]What did I just do?
[170:05.26]Oh...
[170:13.66]Whatever, I...
[170:15.43]It's a dangerous fucking world, man.
[170:18.18]Oh, watch this.
[170:22.45]I don't have any left.
[170:33.72]It's a fake!
[170:43.95]didn't expect me to show up.
[171:00.00]I was hoping she was going to come out.
[171:10.56]She's casting.
[171:11.13]She's pre-casting.
[171:11.85]Do you see the floor?
[171:13.63]Oh my god!
[171:24.40]I was like, who died?
[171:25.34]I gotta run.
[171:34.52]Yeah, you need your spell casted after you were on the ground.
[171:40.10]Okay.
[171:42.91]coins.
[171:43.67]I have so much money.
[171:44.44]I gotta go sell something.
[171:46.43]Or I gotta go buy some shit.
[171:47.39]There's probably tons of good.
[171:48.31]Okay, seven?
[171:49.34]Is there one in the bathroom?
[171:52.35]Seven.
[172:01.00]No.
[172:01.48]So we got seven on the servants' quarters.
[172:07.75]Seven in the boiler room.
[172:12.02]So that's seven, seven, seven, seven, two, I think.
[172:21.51]Hey.
[172:23.70]The light is on.
[172:34.63]Nice.
[172:37.14]Excellent.
[172:37.53]Alright.
[172:38.25]So...
[172:41.12]I actually...
[172:47.93]I think I'm good to go to the kitchen now.
[172:51.71]Although, let me see.
[172:52.19]What do I have?
[172:52.59]What do I have saved?
[172:58.19]Do I want to take anything else?
[172:59.65]I guess I could craft some shit.
[173:05.26]I need a crafting table.
[173:06.53]I need a spell crafting table.
[173:08.16]I gotta go up.
[173:08.92]I need most... Yeah.
[173:17.33]Yeah, I need a crafting table.
[173:19.14]I have to go...
[173:19.94]Wait, can I go to the shortcut?
[173:22.35]Yeah, let me do the shortcut.
[173:27.47]Because this is the wine cellar.
[173:28.82]Basement hallway.
[173:30.49]There we go.
[173:30.79]Yep.
[173:32.62]I just did the shortcut.
[173:33.48]I wasn't even looking.
[173:43.87]I have so much of this to make.
[173:45.99]I have five candles, that's plenty.
[173:52.68]Now that I know what these do, let's not fuck it up again.
[173:55.26]I didn't even use this in my last playthrough.
[174:06.79]Hey, band 6-7.
[174:09.76]And somebody said, dude, your name is Skibidi or something.
[174:13.81]What is going on in this chatroom?
[174:17.52]What is happening over here?
[174:26.40]Okay.
[174:29.87]Alright, stuff's gonna get weird if I'm not careful.
[174:32.41]Although when stuff does get weird, you get like a whole, yeah.
[174:37.77]You actually, I'll show you what I mean.
[174:39.57]Watch this for this.
[174:40.28]Just do one of these.
[174:47.61]Stuff gets weird when you have high curse.
[174:51.05]But you also can get more items potentially.
[175:06.98]Oh my god, he just moved.
[175:13.38]Okay, I'm going back to the basement.
[175:17.26]See, like that.
[175:18.16]Oh shit, I got items from a previous night if you find one of those little chests.
[175:31.74]Nice.
[175:35.61]Hey, can you start aura farming, please?
[175:39.59]Um...
[175:42.01]Hold on.
[175:46.87]Coffin chamber.
[175:54.15]40% less poison buildup, three poison buildup to melee attacks.
[175:57.50]That's kind of cool.
[175:59.47]Befouled head.
[176:01.39]gruesome severed head the top of the skull has been sawed off when removed my asthmatic vapors emerge
[176:08.44]produce a poisonous gas cloud poisoning the holder and anyone nearby every five seconds.
[176:19.81]Ah, Nightingale, excellent timing.
[176:22.29]This is my associate, Mr. Coffins.
[176:25.79]Oui.
[176:25.85]His name is improbably perfect, as I have enlisted him to help with this coffin here.
[176:31.34]Tired of losing all your valuable possessions each night?
[176:34.77]By having Mr. Coffins lock you in here at night, you'll awake with all your things intact.
[176:41.83]There is a small price for this service.
[176:44.25]A few coins.
[176:46.23]Yeah.
[176:47.84]Oh fine, and a snack for Mr. Coffins.
[176:49.69]A corrupted finger or two will do nicely.
[176:52.24]The price will go up each night until you die.
[176:55.37]Dear Mr. Coffins is not a machine and must be compensated for not getting any rest.
[177:00.47]Keep her safe in there, Mr. Coffins.
[177:02.69]Don't eat the customer.
[177:06.67]Yeah, so you can effectively just reset the day without dying.
[177:15.65]What's your mewing streak like?
[177:17.47]Six or seven years.
[177:24.41]God damn it.
[177:26.08]I actually didn't do that on purpose.
[177:29.31]I didn't do it.
[177:29.87]I promise.
[177:30.54]I like wish I could.
[177:31.52]I wish you could get in my brain.
[177:33.73]and just like occupy it for 10 seconds and just go back and recall that you didn't do that on purpose to be like an idiot.
[177:42.85]you would understand you'd go oh he okay I get it I'm in his head I know I get it
[177:47.85]I know, liar, liar, you're a liar.
[177:49.68]I know.
[177:50.38]There's nothing I can say.
[177:52.95]I don't have anything to say.
[177:53.98]There's no rebuttal.
[178:01.52]What do I want to keep with me?
[178:04.82]This thing's goofy, but I don't really want it.
[178:14.43]Do I want to do...
[178:15.19]I think I want to do like throwing jars.
[178:18.74]That's so boring, but I kind of want it.
[178:23.71]Maybe the speed?
[178:24.41]I believe him.
[178:29.99]If he made that joke on purpose, all is lost.
[178:35.35]Your name is DxDiag, by the way.
[178:39.27]You have to be 40.
[178:42.57]You have to be.
[178:45.21]I don't think anybody under the age of 30 knows what a... DirectX Diag... That's DX Diag.
[178:51.48]That's... That's like...
[178:54.84]Playing like TF Classic and trying to figure out why your computer crashed.
[179:00.62]That is an old reference.
[179:06.59]You must be 40.
[179:07.72]I'm just saying that's an old reference to have.
[179:17.12]Why is it weird to be 40?
[179:18.37]I didn't say it was weird.
[179:19.32]I thought it was interesting.
[179:20.08]That's crazy.
[179:24.46]That's too low of a percentage.
[179:27.05]I think they can be higher with luck.
[179:30.28]Should I do full luck build?
[179:34.21]LOL, I'm 26, but I saw it as a kid.
[179:40.98]Well, hey, get that knowledge.
[179:43.78]You guys should be learning about computers.
[179:47.58]Just like figure out, you know, everybody here already probably knows a lot of it.
[179:53.56]Make sure you can navigate around a C drive.
[179:58.95]Because if the robots take over one day and you need to be the one that makes it, it's like, dude...
[180:05.23]How do we get into a directory?
[180:07.60]If only there was somebody after the collapse of society that knows how to...
[180:11.78]Get into a C drive.
[180:13.36]We don't know where that file is.
[180:15.57]You can do it.
[180:16.20]You'll be able to do a C dash.
[180:18.45]There's that folder.
[180:19.67]memory into the memory users slash the system 32 deleted.
[180:35.49]I don't know what I wanna take.
[180:44.51]I'll take the speed ring.
[180:46.66]It's kinda cool.
[180:52.61]There's always a nerd on the team.
[180:54.06]I'm just saying in like a thousand years,
[180:57.29]Just make sure you know how a directory system works on Windows.
[181:01.96]Because it works... and Linux too.
[181:04.15]And SteamOS.
[181:05.68]Dude, alright.
[181:09.39]I'll give you a crazy prediction.
[181:13.49]Valve?
[181:15.36]I really do feel like eventually could be
[181:19.01]They're like, holy shit, remember when they were just making video games and now SteamOS is better than Windows and everybody uses it like 30%?
[181:26.29]It's got like a 20% market share.
[181:28.66]I would not be surprised.
[181:31.14]Remember what people thought about NVIDIA?
[181:33.27]It's 10, 15 years ago.
[181:34.49]Man, wow, those GeForce graphics on that new fucking Crysis game.
[181:40.34]I think if Valve can actually make a good operating system and they really kind of knock it out of the park and they keep developing it, I wouldn't be surprised.
[181:48.33]That might be five years from now.
[181:54.39]I am very curious about it because
[181:59.47]I would make the switch.
[182:01.30]The reason why people don't switch from Windows or even Mac or whatever is
[182:05.80]Program compatibility.
[182:07.51]If you told me that I had an easy interface that still had file structure, that still had a directory, had a good UI...
[182:15.52]and it was compatible with software.
[182:18.19]That was the biggest issue with switching from Windows, was software compatibility.
[182:23.77]And most of the time that was games.
[182:26.78]At least for me, growing up when I was a teenager, getting into my twenties and in my thirties,
[182:31.38]It was, I want something that can play the games I want to play.
[182:35.16]And only one platform seemed to be able to do that.
[182:41.15]So you make it so I can do the things that I like to do on my computer.
[182:46.02]I would switch tomorrow.
[182:53.51]There's still a few streamer things that aren't fully solved in Linux,
[183:03.85]80% of games are on Linux, which is good, but also lacking.
[183:07.69]I think Linux needs to have a kind of Valve-esque
[183:12.31]Because Linux is just a platform, right?
[183:15.35]There's a ton of stuff built on Linux.
[183:18.50]And you almost need to have that, this is the system that everybody can use.
[183:22.95]And it feels pretty fragmented.
[183:27.58]And Steam is built on Linux, so you kind of need... Like, SteamOS, right, is kind of built off of Linux.
[183:35.83]You need that like power piece of hardware software.
[183:41.74]Is it not really?
[183:47.30]Is Steam based on... SteamOS is Linux as much as anything else is Linux.
[183:52.34]I guess that's true.
[183:54.14]Linux is the kernel.
[183:55.05]Valve is making a distro and software to come...
[183:57.21]Okay.
[183:57.29]I wish them the best of luck, I really do.
[184:06.56]Because like I said, if there was a really good clean...
[184:14.42]I need to take a second after that one.
[184:15.57]I was not prepared for that.
[184:21.43]Oh my god, I'm cursed, that's why.
[184:23.52]Alright, we gotta go to the kitchen.
[184:30.47]Oh, I put that here.
[184:34.25]I got scared for a second.
[184:35.75]I put that there.
[184:36.60]That's mine.
[184:46.74]Oh, get me the fuck out of this place.
[184:49.29]Alright, let's go back to the basement.
[184:56.00]But first.
[185:05.15]I don't care about the axe.
[185:08.08]I don't care about this thing.
[185:14.77]Can shoot fireworks at people.
[185:16.27]Okay.
[185:21.21]This is kind of useful.
[185:30.11]I'll keep everything else.
[185:38.10]Oh shit, hold on.
[185:42.97]25% less bleeding.
[185:44.39]This is max health, curse, bleed, coin discovery.
[185:51.61]This one seems kind of good.
[185:55.82]This adds bleed to your attacks.
[186:00.65]This is heavy.
[186:05.39]Actually, probably should have this.
[186:15.67]I'm going to get a few of these.
[186:16.73]OK, and then maybe this.
[186:25.88]No, I think we should
[186:36.07]Hmm.
[186:38.38]I'll get it.
[186:40.82]What is this thing that I have on right now?
[186:44.90]Okay, so this is 5% less damage, 2% less damage, but I guess the poise is huge.
[187:02.14]It doesn't change the appearance.
[187:03.10]Yeah, it does.
[187:03.65]Yeah.
[187:08.07]Yeah, there is drip in this game.
[187:11.41]Let's clear this.
[187:28.55]Dude, like the guy that stands up in the middle.
[187:33.75]It's that meme of the guy with like, I don't know, in the courtroom or something.
[187:36.52]I don't know what it is.
[187:37.46]I'm standing up and I'm saying something before like, I'll take the sac- I'll be sacrificed.
[187:42.98]It's just like one guy stands up just says, toenail cam or we riot.
[187:47.87]instantly deleted.
[187:49.33]Guy is gone.
[187:51.35]Just gone.
[187:57.14]I imagine that person's being like, I'm going to say it.
[187:59.49]I'm going to stand up for all of us that want this.
[188:01.97]And they're just instantly fucking annihilated.
[188:04.24]And then everybody kind of looks around and they're like, I don't really, I didn't want that.
[188:09.28]I don't care about that.
[188:10.08]That guy literally stood up and sacrificed himself for no reason.
[188:13.61]I didn't even want that.
[188:16.82]Like I sacrificed his chatting privileges for like 25 minutes.
[188:22.92]Thank you.
[188:29.56]For something so... For something so, like... Like, benign and weird.
[188:34.13]You know what I mean?
[188:40.91]Uh, the internet is fuckin' fried.
[188:43.16]Alright.
[188:45.11]Let's go in the kitchen.
[188:46.69]And, uh, I've got my spells.
[188:49.81]I have to activate this because this is scary.
[188:52.50]This is a safe state right here.
[188:59.59]Nope.
[189:08.32]Oh, you must be the new boy.
[189:10.77]Just so you're aware, the last boy died of sepsis.
[189:14.08]He did not listen carefully to my instructions.
[189:17.11]This patient's dying.
[189:18.64]I need you to run to the lab and craft a tonic jar.
[189:23.54]Oh, but that's all I have for heals.
[189:26.23]You may be just of some use, boy.
[189:30.18]Talk.
[189:30.94]Butcher.
[189:32.40]I do have a name, of course, but I'd rather not sully my reputation in the real world.
[189:38.48]Finding work has been difficult for an old-fashioned craftsman like myself.
[189:41.93]So I've had to do things I'm not proud of.
[189:45.05]That bloody fool, Joseph Lister, has turned the art of surgery into a complete farce.
[189:52.48]Dr. Black had offered me to top pay for a simple job.
[189:57.23]Each night I delivered him fresh corpses and dissect them.
[190:02.47]He claimed he was starting a medical school, but there were no students in that school.
[190:09.30]The bodies were to be anatomized.
[190:11.91]I don't know how to say that word either, mate.
[190:15.43]And I'm going to wait five seconds for everyone in the chat to correct how I'm saying it, because they do that.
[190:22.68]So I'm going to wait.
[190:26.35]Wait a minute.
[190:34.80]Anatomized.
[190:37.96]Apparently, I've been saying it correct the whole time, mate.
[190:40.97]Alright.
[190:41.73]Anotomized in front of curious window, the observer...
[190:45.04]Hold on.
[190:45.36]The bodies were to be anotomized...
[190:47.49]in front of a curious window, the Observer cloaked in shadow,
[190:52.74]A few nights later, when I awoke in the dream, the truth was made clear.
[190:56.53]I'd been hired to introduce the dream to the mechanical operations of the human body.
[191:01.95]Now I stay on assisting Dr. Blackett, yes, but performing my own investigations as well.
[191:13.93]The dream affords me the rare opportunity to study the human body in exacting detail.
[191:19.52]Each night, the dead are reanimated anew, so no one can truly practice in a way impossible in the real world.
[191:29.19]When I first arrived in the dream, I performed many an experiment on willing subjects.
[191:33.26]Well, mostly willing.
[191:35.17]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[191:36.17]Thank you.
[191:37.11]I think.
[191:38.02]Progress requires sacrifices, no?
[191:41.51]For instance, I spent a few weeks slicing one gentleman's Achilles tendon in a different way each night.
[191:46.81]as you can imagine he grew stock raving mad
[191:50.96]But by the end, I was able to consistently repair that hobbled foot.
[191:55.50]Don't even get me started on what I've learned about the brain.
[192:01.61]This guy's twisted.
[192:05.40]I believe I'm still alive in the real world, and that in a few more nights I'll awake as usual.
[192:10.42]Initially I had only the faintest memories upon waking, but over time I've learned to retain more.
[192:17.50]As soon as I awoke, I pick up a scalpel and retrace what I just did in a dream, what I've practiced in a dream.
[192:25.57]Additionally, I believe there's a way to escape the dream at will.
[192:29.07]But I certainly won't tell you about it, my little secret.
[192:33.27]Also...
[192:35.12]If I ever hear of you sneaking around Moston Mausoleum, I will cut your eyes out.
[192:47.22]Oh, I see.
[192:48.89]You're not the new boy.
[192:50.93]You're a puppet.
[192:53.10]I'm gonna snip your strings.
[193:00.38]Die!
[193:01.35]Oops.
[193:14.51]Poison him!
[193:17.78]Oh, we're both poisoned.
[193:18.68]It hurts me.
[193:19.36]No, I'm poisoned.
[193:20.45]Oh shit, that's not good.
[193:23.03]Where's the antidote?
[193:29.04]I'm just hiding in a boss fight.
[193:31.29]Okay, don't fuck around.
[193:32.28]I gotta fight this guy.
[193:48.90]Come on.
[193:55.32]I wish I had more acid.
[193:57.35]Ah!
[194:03.44]I'm poisoned and I'm bleeding.
[194:13.27]Anybody have bandages?
[194:22.78]What is he doing?
[194:32.94]What is he doing?
[194:33.83]Why is this guy frying?
[194:35.53]You left that guy on the burner, dude!
[194:38.97]He's just cooking that guy!
[194:40.68]He left the eggs on the fucking griddle!
[194:42.87]Oh my god.
[195:05.34]Ah!
[195:14.34]Just fuckin' smash him!
[195:21.10]Oh, fuck!
[195:22.82]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[195:23.85]I'm alright, I'm alright.
[195:24.53]Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[195:33.44]I have knives and shit, don't I?
[195:35.24]Alright, I got coffee.
[195:41.67]Uh, I got meat.
[195:43.96]I got... What are the...
[195:45.45]I can throw everything at him.
[195:46.25]I have somebody...
[195:46.63]I got invincibility.
[195:48.58]Throwing knife.
[195:49.76]And I'm gonna throw a firework.
[195:56.32]Should I take a picture of him?
[195:58.97]Throw the meat at him.
[196:00.96]No, I got it.
[196:01.50]I got it.
[196:01.93]I got it right now.
[196:02.69]Oops.
[196:06.19]OK, I gotta plan this out here, so hold on, let's.
[196:12.53]And then firework.
[196:16.25]Oh my God, that was awesome, but he's still alive.
[196:38.39]That didn't hurt him.
[196:39.83]I don't think that hurts.
[196:40.80]He's not a ghost.
[196:47.62]There are no fireworks.
[196:50.94]Oh, my God.
[196:51.89]Why did I not dodge under it?
[196:59.57]Die!
[196:59.89]Alright, I got him.
[197:01.17]I got him.
[197:01.41]I got him.
[197:01.67]I'm good.
[197:08.56]I'm sorry.
[197:12.33]It's so stupid that...
[197:14.70]The guy...
[197:14.96]This guy's fighting...
[197:15.74]This...
[197:16.83]It's so dumb.
[197:18.18]Alright.
[197:18.64]The right eye to an ancient stone idol.
[197:22.21]Something is just fucking frying over here.
[197:27.52]Drop into Remembrance Shrine to remember an additional item.
[197:32.47]And there he is.
[197:33.12]Alright, turn this, how do I turn this off?
[197:50.36]Don't do that.
[197:58.61]West basement stairwell.
[197:59.90]Okay.
[198:02.03]I probably should go back.
[198:05.53]But I'm...
[198:07.93]Stupid.
[198:10.01]What are the quests right now?
[198:13.13]Okay, we can rescue Felix.
[198:17.33]Lord, nobody wants a photo.
[198:19.29]And find a use for the right idle eye.
[198:21.25]Perhaps Margaret knows something.
[198:22.82]Okay, we can go back.
[198:24.85]But there's a little bit more to see over here.
[198:29.09]So let's see it.
[198:35.35]Good.
[198:40.43]I forget what this is.
[198:41.86]It's something weird.
[198:47.16]I already have a cleaver.
[198:48.05]I'll just sell it.
[198:53.91]Oh, this is the other side of the banquet hall.
[198:56.34]Right.
[198:57.93]Oh.
[199:02.37]Another one.
[199:05.22]Nope.
[199:08.16]Nope.
[199:11.03]Oh, you... Come on.
[199:24.64]No!
[199:25.11]It's gonna hit me in the face.
[199:29.89]I'm so stupid with this thing.
[199:31.12]Give me the meat.
[199:37.47]You're such a coward!
[199:38.41]Fight me head-on!
[199:39.22]Thank you.
[199:45.25]Ooh.
[199:46.45]Oh, that's the spell that she's doing.
[199:48.12]The summon spear thing.
[199:49.55]Summon a field of pointed spears from the ground.
[199:55.42]Nice.
[200:00.10]Do I have the item for this?
[200:01.13]I do!
[200:04.72]Yeah, I remember this being a pretty good one.
[200:06.17]And we can do this.
[200:11.85]Alright.
[200:12.27]100% need this.
[200:21.07]Although, is that just...
[200:22.66]I don't think that's learning it.
[200:23.67]I think that's just the spell, right?
[200:26.57]No, it's the book.
[200:30.22]I'm...
[200:31.04]I forget.
[200:36.34]It's just one spell?
[200:37.70]Okay.
[200:41.78]I have two more slots.
[200:44.77]Maybe the Bible.
[200:47.90]And...
[200:50.91]And...
[201:02.48]That's a good photo.
[201:06.24]If you had to eat one thing for the rest of your life, what would you eat?
[201:09.56]Um...
[201:13.79]Honestly, I've thought about this a lot.
[201:16.84]It's weird that you said that.
[201:19.87]I think I could eat a tuna fish sandwich every single day.
[201:25.27]I actually think I could do it.
[201:30.00]Just a tuna fish sandwich.
[201:33.25]gently toasted with a slice of either swiss cheese or provolone maybe a little bit of celery in there chopped up maybe
[201:44.60]I could eat that.
[201:45.15]Oh, lettuce?
[201:45.55]I could eat that every day.
[201:48.00]I would never, ever get sick of it.
[201:51.25]Raising Cane's box combo?
[201:54.81]Probably Yeah, that too.
[201:55.90]That's that's not a bad pick.
[202:02.08]That's the worst possible answer.
[202:08.95]I'm not saying it would be healthy to do that every day.
[202:11.33]I'm just saying I could.
[202:15.03]Okay, with a tuna fish sandwich, I have the same reaction as if I ate it for the first time ever each time I eat it.
[202:23.03]Each first bite of that sandwich is whoa, this is it's as if I never ever ate it before.
[202:31.38]I think I'll take this one.
[202:37.47]So now I can unlock this, which is the scary guys over here.
[202:42.49]Oh, I can... Let me take a picture of the...
[202:45.30]Hold on.
[202:48.12]Where is he?
[202:53.16]He's right there, right?
[202:55.05]Got him.
[203:00.12]Killed him.
[203:00.76]I want to get a picture of this guy.
[203:14.24]Goodbye.
[203:18.70]Got that guy mid-fart.
[203:22.43]Okay, that lock is broken.
[203:26.85]Let's go back Here's your photo
[203:40.91]Oh, I talked to him for a second.
[203:43.46]It's beautiful, isn't it?
[203:44.52]No better place to spend eternity, I think.
[203:46.81]It helps that nowhere is a crossroads of sorts, so I'm often meeting new people.
[203:52.09]Nowhere is the only place in the dream you can get to and from everywhere.
[203:57.39]Initially, it was just me, and then my trusty crow flew in from the portal.
[204:02.38]I've given him many names, but can't seem to remember any of them for very long.
[204:06.66]Sometime later, that old bag over there wandered in from who knows where.
[204:11.46]I can't stand her, but what can I do?
[204:13.85]She's so old that if I threw her through the portal, she'd turn to dust.
[204:20.31]Uh, tuna's disgusting.
[204:22.54]I'm still traumatized from tuna sandwiches as a child.
[204:25.07]It just has a terrible smell.
[204:29.39]It's alright.
[204:30.91]You're not going to convince me that tuna fish is not good.
[204:35.97]We have a difference.
[204:37.50]And that's okay.
[204:39.95]I think tuna fish is unbelievable.
[204:43.51]I love it.
[204:44.96]I have memories when I was a kid unrolling a little tuna hoagie roll and just being like, yeah!
[204:50.48]And I would open it and I would put Lay's potato chips in it, close the bread, crush it into the tuna,
[204:58.67]Yep.
[205:00.58]Excuse me.
[205:08.05]Okay, let me sell the, which one is it?
[205:09.85]This one, right?
[205:12.40]Okay, there it is.
[205:14.31]This photo positively gives me the chills.
[205:17.12]For your reward, take this perception codex.
[205:20.37]Ooh.
[205:30.49]Excellent.
[205:36.42]Perfect.
[205:48.53]Tuna salad versus chicken salad in a fight?
[205:52.77]Um...
[205:56.04]I don't know.
[205:56.40]That's like saying, what's a better day, Friday or Saturday, for the most part.
[206:00.98]It's like, mm.
[206:02.57]Those are both weekend days.
[206:04.61]for the better half of almost my entire life, right?
[206:08.21]It's those days where it's just, Friday night was awesome.
[206:12.02]Saturday was awesome.
[206:13.94]It's like saying is Friday or Saturday better.
[206:15.45]I don't know if I could pick.
[206:18.42]Like Friday night versus Saturday afternoon.
[206:22.57]I don't know.
[206:23.70]They both fit different categories in my brain in the same place.
[206:30.06]Friday's not the weekend?
[206:31.33]Well, I'm saying like Friday night, that feeling of just the week is over,
[206:36.61]I got the rest of the evening now for whatever I want to do.
[206:39.72]And this goes back to school too.
[206:40.86]This goes back to a lot of when I was in like high school and college and stuff too.
[206:45.76]It's like, man, it's over that the relief of like the week is now over, especially in school.
[207:04.44]Chicken salad is better.
[207:06.11]Tuna, bleh.
[207:09.48]Yeah, I'm...
[207:10.23]I...
[207:10.89]Wait, really?
[207:13.97]Am I missing science?
[207:15.18]What time is it?
[207:16.92]I gotta get to class.
[207:18.75]I still have those dreams though.
[207:21.98]Alright, let's go.
[207:22.65]We need to go to... Gotta go talk to Margaret.
[207:26.12]Where's Margaret?
[207:33.83]I think she's here, right?
[207:36.58]Oh, I want to buy stuff
[207:45.73]Good evening.
[207:47.96]I got money.
[207:52.80]Grandpa.
[207:53.28]Oh, give me that.
[207:57.20]Apprentice's candlestick.
[207:59.78]Don't do that.
[208:06.86]So this is the thing that scales with magic?
[208:10.35]I guess I could get it.
[208:13.64]Just try it for a little bit.
[208:23.31]Okay.
[208:25.06]How does it work?
[208:28.59]I don't know if I ever used it.
[208:33.50]It shoots out like a little... Oh, it's giving me curse too, shit.
[208:39.14]Oh god, well...
[208:41.41]I gotta sit in the chair.
[208:49.15]Is this the Dark Souls of side-scrollers?
[208:50.90]It is Withering Rooms.
[208:53.85]It's good shit.
[209:05.99]I think I'm good.
[209:06.72]I got heals.
[209:14.93]Okay, she's... in the study?
[209:21.00]If I remember.
[209:29.93]Margaret!
[209:31.64]I need to talk to Margaret.
[209:37.26]There you are.
[209:39.87]You met the first witch.
[209:41.81]Also, you've killed the butcher surgeon?
[209:50.59]That's tremendous news.
[209:52.18]I'm not one to celebrate the death of a fellow human being.
[209:54.89]But the butcher wasn't quite human, was he?
[209:57.74]you should proceed at once to Mostyn Mausoleum with that object you found.
[210:02.32]It must be some sort of key.
[210:04.47]The mausoleum can be found deep in the hedge maze,
[210:07.28]Some of the paths through the maze may be invisible to the naked eye.
[210:10.12]You'll need to be sufficiently cursed to see through the illusions.
[210:15.63]Yeah, this place is horrible.
[210:18.14]I hate this place.
[210:20.41]Okay, this is the poison swamp part of the game that I don't like.
[210:25.55]Oh, let me get him out of the cage.
[210:35.93]I played Garfield Kart.
[210:37.30]That game sucked.
[210:43.87]Let me build the cursor.
[210:48.64]Okay.
[210:55.35]Guess I didn't have to do that.
[210:56.47]I could've just walked to the right.
[210:59.00]Yeah, whatever, if I die, I die.
[211:01.00]I have twigs, I can run around.
[211:16.78]Welcome to Mario Kart.
[211:20.96]Select your player.
[211:22.27]Select your player.
[211:23.81]Select your player.
[211:25.64]No.
[211:26.93]Select your player!
[211:28.08]Select your player!
[211:30.03]Those are all sufficiently bad.
[211:33.11]I can do this so much better without headphones in.
[211:38.15]No.
[211:45.79]Alright, you gotta find your way through this maze.
[211:47.64]This place is a fuckin' shitshow.
[211:50.12]Um...
[211:51.16]It's a bunch of spirits and shit, and you have to run.
[211:54.20]It sucks.
[212:01.86]Yeah, bring candles, bring twigs.
[212:03.71]Oh, the Bible.
[212:06.67]Yep.
[212:15.04]Where's that perception ring?
[212:16.40]Do I even have it?
[212:20.38]Not really.
[212:21.24]I might just put...
[212:21.80]I'm gonna put this on.
[212:26.82]Uh, we should take off.
[212:29.68]I don't care about the bleed resistance.
[212:31.01]I want to run fast.
[212:34.00]Yeah, I want to be way faster.
[212:35.19]Good.
[212:36.60]Alright.
[212:36.88]Okay, I'm ready.
[212:45.33]Curse me.
[212:47.08]I think this, yeah, this gives you curse.
[212:52.02]I got my camera.
[212:52.66]I need the Bible equipped.
[213:00.97]Because you can, like, stay back!
[213:06.52]Alright, here we go.
[213:12.97]I have my heels on the bar.
[213:14.08]I don't have my heels on the bar.
[213:23.67]Let's go!
[213:30.25]Bleh!
[213:33.42]great that was insane that I did not get hit
[213:45.76]I got him.
[213:46.64]Good.
[213:49.58]Spectral remains.
[213:53.05]That guy moved?
[213:55.42]That guy moved.
[214:04.32]No no no no no no!
[214:16.71]Read inscription.
[214:18.39]The weary traveler lost in night breathes many a longing sigh and marks the welcome dawn of light with rapture in his eye.
[214:25.89]In memory of Anne Mostyn, loving mother to twins Peter and Priscilla.
[214:35.02]Ooh, good.
[214:39.11]Okay, is that it?
[214:40.52]Yeah, you have no- the map is useless here.
[214:42.07]You don't really have a map.
[214:54.13]Okay.
[214:58.15]Ooh!
[214:59.91]Light radius ring.
[215:02.80]Zombie outfit.
[215:07.16]Can fool most undead into thinking the wearer is one of them.
[215:12.04]So you can't really do anything but you can hide.
[215:14.53]That's cool.
[215:22.25]Enchant spell.
[215:24.18]This lets you enchant armor in the room.
[215:28.22]There's people in the suits of armor you can possess them and they become summons field of vampiric energy
[215:38.89]Cool.
[215:40.25]What the fuck is that?
[215:41.56]What sound is that?
[215:43.37]Oh, I'm just... What's going on?
[215:55.12]Nope.
[215:59.52]Ah!
[216:02.19]Uh, hold on.
[216:06.51]Ah!
[216:12.05]Ooh, Life Ring.
[216:16.03]Yeah!
[216:20.01]Uh-oh, this is bad.
[216:24.09]What an idiot.
[216:26.40]Get away from me!
[216:32.52]Ghost child.
[216:36.68]I'm so glad I bought the camera.
[216:50.61]Nice.
[216:57.85]I need it
[217:04.09]I don't know.
[217:05.88]This is Jurassic Park.
[217:17.45]Nice.
[217:18.12]I think I actually did it.
[217:19.91]Did I get lucky enough to...
[217:21.54]I did!
[217:21.80]Alright, that's actually awesome.
[217:25.30]I'll tell you, not knowing kind of where to go here, and not having the camera was actually awful.
[217:34.06]Pointless poison.
[217:39.68]Oh, well.
[217:43.90]We need...
[217:44.36]This is a save state.
[218:00.82]Ah, a fresh face.
[218:01.97]You look about the same age as me.
[218:03.96]Your face still looks intact though.
[218:06.31]I think my body must be rotting in reality and my face is the first thing to go in a dream.
[218:11.69]My name's Emma, not that it matters.
[218:13.73]I'll make you a deal.
[218:15.10]Bring me an enchant spell and I'll help you break into this mausoleum.
[218:20.31]You're gonna like what's inside, trust me.
[218:22.92]First, Witch can teach you how to make your enchantment.
[218:25.69]Alternatively, there may be some scrolls you can get if they're in the right range.
[218:34.29]You know, I'm thinking.
[218:41.34]What's in there is pretty valuable.
[218:47.57]I think I'll keep it for myself.
[218:49.31]No hard feelings.
[218:57.08]Coffee?
[219:02.32]I actually might die here.
[219:04.74]He's...
[219:06.05]He's getting a steel chair.
[219:12.37]Oh no, it's her!
[219:13.14]Right, kill her.
[219:13.80]I have no- I'm gonna die.
[219:30.77]Hit her, please.
[219:41.40]Get away!
[219:48.82]I have to, hold on.
[219:50.60]I got damage spells, right?
[219:57.43]Okay.
[219:57.95]Yep.
[219:58.96]I'm gonna do Summon Spears.
[220:01.87]Checking this out.
[220:02.44]Ready?
[220:08.68]Where is she?
[220:15.30]Yeah, I stabbed her!
[220:23.28]I can't just go in
[220:36.17]Oh, come on.
[220:38.54]I wish I had jars.
[220:46.59]Uh oh.
[220:59.58]Oh, she just hit her friend.
[221:09.94]I need more... spells or something.
[221:20.15]Don't I have some of the crazy shit I can throw?
[221:24.33]Harvest- Wait, for 20 seconds deal damage to each second and heal- Ooh.
[221:28.06]I'll do that.
[221:37.16]Am I damaging somebody?
[221:38.49]Oh, I am.
[221:38.87]Look at her health.
[221:43.72]I just got crushed.
[221:44.74]That was bad.
[221:47.54]This spell is incredible.
[221:49.36]It's just a permanent dot for 20 seconds.
[221:58.91]I'm not going to do it.
[222:04.69]Jesus.
[222:18.81]Forgive me, I'm safe.
[222:37.69]I can't attack during this though, I don't think.
[222:46.96]Sequel after that?
[222:57.92]I don't care.
[223:10.14]I don't care.
[223:12.09]It's gonna be close.
[223:20.74]Any more bread or buns or anything?
[223:23.15]Oh, I do.
[223:28.81]Scone.
[223:32.23]This music kind of fucks.
[223:33.88]I love this soundtrack.
[223:35.09]It's great.
[223:42.10]Damn it!
[223:44.01]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[223:49.54]I could eat the dirty, disgusting meat.
[224:01.44]Just bash her head in.
[224:07.16]No, I'm being so dumb.
[224:10.11]I'm being so annoying.
[224:23.19]No, I wanted to cure my whatever.
[224:28.06]OK. Well, this time that's not going to happen because she's dead.
[224:52.30]I'm just gonna spam on her head.
[224:54.59]I'm just gonna hit her in the head as many times as I can.
[225:00.00]No, I didn't quit the game!
[225:01.00]I'm here!
[225:04.50]Set her on fire.
[225:05.33]I...
[225:06.22]Okay, if I lose again, then I'm just gonna turn around and I'm gonna make some new spells.
[225:23.07]Alright, well he's distracted.
[225:24.01]That's actually great that he picked that up.
[225:26.00]Holy shit.
[225:26.81]No, it's not.
[225:27.17]I thought he only threw it.
[225:35.11]Okay.
[225:35.79]Better than last time.
[225:46.34]Let's get this out.
[225:50.51]Got her, okay.
[225:52.38]Give me the other one.
[225:55.63]Whoops.
[226:04.21]I can stay close to them.
[226:09.04]She's already at half.
[226:11.95]Thank God I dodged.
[226:23.34]Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[226:29.34]Somebody said, I think I keep thinking that's my dog.
[226:33.13]You said that like 13 or 14 minutes ago.
[226:35.84]You said that a long time ago.
[226:38.33]And then I thought you were just being a weirdo.
[226:40.32]Now I understand.
[227:01.11]Alright, the greed is so annoying to have.
[227:13.33]I'm good Holy shit
[227:25.21]There it is.
[227:25.98]Okay.
[227:31.52]GOATS fashion record.
[227:33.59]Set of notes that can record the current list of equipped rings, amulets, and outfits for quick recall.
[227:42.18]I think these are kind of like loadouts.
[227:51.31]29 coins.
[227:58.53]You seem like the kind of guy that eats turkey medium rare.
[228:03.68]You can't eat poultry under 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
[228:13.79]I don't know why you would think that that was a good idea.
[228:26.40]You can't tell me what to do?
[228:27.58]No, I can't tell you what to do, but we can... We can cut to the doctor's office
[228:33.43]with you complaining about stomach problems.
[228:37.61]And the doctor's like, well, that's what happens when you eat raw turkey.
[228:43.88]You're going to have to go on these antibiotics for like two or three weeks.
[228:54.48]Alright, here's the mausoleum.
[228:59.39]I knew it...
[229:00.43]I knew there's one.
[229:02.27]Curse Sentinel Candle?
[229:03.94]I don't have one of those.
[229:06.22]Huh?
[229:08.92]Alright.

[230:33.48]And then mother.
[230:34.43]six days a week caring for the rest, and one day to honor God.
[230:40.08]Truly the family is divine.
[230:45.90]Every letter?
[230:47.95]Okay, so that's gonna be the second letter of dad, fourth letter of... Oh wait, the four corners?
[230:55.49]No.
[230:55.89]Second letter of dad.
[230:57.54]Fourth letter of sister.

[232:15.48]Two-eye div.
[232:24.64]DIV.
[232:34.27]I am smart.
[232:43.35]This will end chapter one.
[232:45.03]Hold on.
[232:45.49]Did I get everything I wanted?
[232:51.06]Did we see?
[232:51.87]I think I got all the rooms.
[232:53.21]I think I did.
[232:56.93]Pretty sure I got everything I wanted.
[232:59.04]No!
[232:59.26]The guy in the cage!
[233:06.01]Dude, you withered every room, man.
[233:10.32]I kinda did.
[233:12.55]Oh, this sucks absolute asshole.
[233:15.00]I don't wanna have to go through all this again.
[233:22.00]Oh, wait, thank God.
[233:23.20]Alright, where was he?
[233:34.69]I think it was basement... cellar?
[233:37.53]Storage?
[233:38.12]Basement storage, I think, right?
[233:43.68]Alright, I'll let you out.
[233:49.62]I have the key.
[233:51.70]Oh, you will not regret this, not one bit.
[233:55.31]Let us dust ourselves off and we'll meet you upstairs in the study.
[234:02.26]You gonna do chapter two tonight?
[234:04.41]Uh, yeah.
[234:06.10]I'm here for like a little while.
[234:07.34]At least a little while longer.
[234:09.96]Alright, so let's go to the study.
[234:23.34]Where's the study?
[234:30.80]Ugh!
[234:33.98]Oh, there's no mirror in the study.
[234:36.69]This place is cursed.
[234:39.04]This is a curse.
[234:40.69]This is a dying curse.
[234:46.66]Oh shit.
[234:52.14]What the fuck, dude?
[234:53.35]Okay.
[234:58.72]You are not wanted here.
[235:09.84]Alright, where is he?
[235:13.71]There you are.
[235:18.72]Did you see the Sus Guy movie trailer?
[235:24.35]What a piece of dog shit that would be.
[235:32.69]I don't even know if it'll be worth the royalty check.
[235:36.83]If I could do like total veto, like total veto crush...
[235:41.64]a project, because I would be able to, right?
[235:51.85]If they're like, oh, hey, we're going to be making the Susguy movie.
[235:54.14]It's going to be you.
[235:54.72]It's going to be you or the Susguy.
[235:57.89]I'd say, no, absolutely not.
[236:02.38]Well, what about the royalties, man?
[236:03.72]You're going to make like five bucks every ticket sale.
[236:07.28]That's absurd.
[236:08.50]That's not even possible.
[236:09.85]I'd still be like, no.
[236:11.56]I'm not letting you make that movie.
[236:14.85]I will stand up and defend that IP right.
[236:19.59]You'll never be able to make that movie.
[236:21.80]And I'm going to make sure to pass on to my estate that no one can make that movie.
[236:26.04]No one can use that media ever.
[236:36.72]What if it was directed by Christopher Nolan?
[236:38.44]No.
[236:39.67]No.
[236:40.59]It's being vetoed no matter what in this hypothetical scenario.
[236:52.87]A Redditor made the sus guy image.
[236:54.60]You don't have rain over it.
[236:56.17]That's MY face.
[236:59.89]That's my face.
[237:01.54]I have at least a 50 to 70% of rain over that.
[237:13.69]It's public property.
[237:16.86]See, I know, it's crazy.
[237:20.02]It's legally distinct.
[237:29.30]I'm... Well, then you better send me a fucking cool million then.
[237:35.29]If I go to court and I'm like, hey, this guy took my face and made it into this thing.
[237:39.42]It's legally distinct as another thing.
[237:42.21]I want at least... What did he make?
[237:45.09]You made 50 million dollars in that movie?
[237:46.88]I want 1 million and I'll go away.
[237:49.41]We'll have a, uh, literally we'll go back, like, it'll be like a, a settlement, right?
[237:53.44]We'll just go back and be like, look, man.
[237:55.08]I don't want to drag this out.
[237:56.73]You don't want to drag this out.
[237:58.26]Just write me the check for a cool million and I'll fuck off.
[238:00.97]You made $75 million on that movie.
[238:02.90]I don't just maybe I'll fuck off.
[238:05.53]I don't want to have to drag this through.
[238:08.18]What about 1.3 million?
[238:09.55]You're right.
[238:12.00]That's true.
[238:12.56]I'm going against my own rule.
[238:15.11]Alright.
[238:18.31]Now that we're free, Horace and I would like to offer you a special service.
[238:28.78]What the fuck dude, I don't remember it happening during like cutscenes or like talking to people I know that
[238:38.57]Why does that happen?
[238:39.96]I think it's because I have like almost maximum curse and the game just freaks you out.
[238:53.32]Was that me gasping?
[238:54.50]Yeah.
[238:58.21]Are you going to be in the Cathy Mitchell documentary?
[239:00.44]Oh, that sounds so cool.
[239:01.63]I can't wait to watch it.
[239:03.23]I would love to watch it.
[239:04.96]Okay, as I understand it, the witch in the basement is always looking for offerings.
[239:08.85]Fingers, hearts, and that sort of thing.
[239:10.48]I don't know much about witchcraft myself, but I do know how to procure these offerings.
[239:17.92]You see, Horace and I are skilled hunters, always in search of our next target.
[239:22.44]So, you just let me know if you'd like us to go hunting, and I'm sure we can make a deal.
[239:29.74]Strangest thing waking up in the dark all locked up.
[239:32.93]What kind of wretched creature puts a dog in a little cage like that?
[239:37.11]Suppose we'll never know who the culprit was, but I assure you I am very grateful to be free.
[239:49.18]You've done a fine thing.
[239:51.65]And we'd like to reward you by offering you our hunting services.
[239:58.74]Horace has been my primary companion for years, in life and in the dream.
[240:03.94]I was born into a proper rich family, did not get along with them, took the family dog and went my own way.
[240:11.25]It's like trying to be quiet, opening a door at night.
[240:18.72]Yeah, that's true.
[240:22.10]The only thing I've ever really been good at is hunting.
[240:25.91]Not good with people, not good with numbers, but Horace and I can track a fox for miles.
[240:32.05]Doesn't help with paying the bills though.
[240:35.36]Alright, go hunting.
[240:36.57]God damn it.
[240:39.50]Uh, what do I want?
[240:42.93]I have one of these.
[240:43.67]I have zero of these.
[240:46.36]I think the thing I have zero of.
[240:51.77]Excellent.
[240:52.13]We'll be right back.
[240:59.51]He just, he's never coming back, is he?
[241:01.04]I am dirty.
[241:04.53]There we are.
[241:04.96]Pleasure doing business with you.
[241:13.62]Okay.
[241:16.17]Okay.
[241:20.32]Going for it, Margaret.
[241:30.58]Alright, let me get rid of the curse.
[241:33.08]Or at least enough of it where it's not everything freaking out and screaming at me every five seconds.
[241:39.90]There we go.
[241:43.93]Okay, he's good.
[241:44.99]I think I did everything else that I want to do.
[241:46.54]I can move on to the second chapter.
[241:51.05]Second chapter does not mean we don't come back here ever again.
[241:53.80]It's just... progresses the story.
[241:58.43]So I need to go back to nowhere.
[242:04.46]When was the last time you bathed?
[242:08.09]You're going to play the bird game or not?
[242:10.16]I'm not going to repeat myself, brother.
[242:11.61]I just want to have to pull the ass maneuver.
[242:13.87]I just don't want to have to pull the ass maneuver.
[242:16.00]What is the bird game?
[242:25.13]What's the bird game?
[242:28.26]It's called Bird Game 3.
[242:36.36]It's the famous bird game, dude.
[242:38.42]I don't know what the bird game is.
[242:49.79]Been playing Look Outside since you mentioned it.
[242:51.81]Game rips.
[242:53.60]It's great.
[242:55.54]It's such a nice experience.
[242:57.11]It's a great experience.
[242:59.29]I love it.
[243:02.98]Yeah, I don't know what Bird Game 3 is.
[243:05.15]I'll look it up later.
[243:07.58]Alright, I'm good to continue.
[243:08.82]I think I'm good to progress.
[243:10.10]Nothing else to do.
[243:12.21]Although...
[243:15.52]I haven't died.
[243:16.25]I kind of have money.
[243:17.23]I have tons of items.
[243:17.90]Look at all the items I have.
[243:19.03]This is kind of crazy.
[243:28.06]It's just called, it's not Bird Game 3, it's just called Bird Game.
[243:35.90]Why are you guys adding a 3?
[243:41.92]I think a Susky movie is more likely than a Three Stooges and Fortnite.
[243:45.95]No way.
[243:49.21]Just wait until that music kicks in and it's like old, dusty, scratchy CRT with the...
[243:56.63]black and white.
[243:57.88]They'll open the trailer in black and white with a bunch of crust all over it, static.
[244:03.87]Relive the moments.
[244:12.14]And it's gonna be Curly, Larry, and Moe as the same character all together.
[244:18.38]So you're kind of shoulder to shoulder.
[244:19.77]You have a huge hitbox.
[244:21.34]So that's not great.
[244:22.06]You have a three person wide hitbox.
[244:23.87]You move together.
[244:24.56]Tighter than ice climbers though.
[244:27.73]And you, when you do, when you shoot the weapon, it depends on like kind of, you can swap between, no, no, it's just Mo.
[244:34.56]Mo is the one that has like the weapons and the guns and stuff.
[244:36.91]But when you shoot, Curly, like every two seconds of holding down the trigger, like every two seconds of fire,
[244:44.72]Curly will do the finger poke into the eye of Larry and you take like 10 HP damage.
[244:50.97]But Mo has like a rage meter where when it fills all the way up you can kind of like just like attack the other two and it gives you like 50% more damage.
[245:03.91]Something like that.
[245:17.44]zoomers love three stooges just wait till people think it's cool and then I get to be right
[245:28.70]Do kids playing Fortnite even know who they are?
[245:31.49]Well, they should.
[245:35.24]Alright, let's move.
[245:36.20]I already did.
[245:36.65]I got everything I need.
[245:43.01]I guess I- wait, actually I should buy... Oh, fuck me.
[245:50.27]Cut to a skeleton in a chair.
[246:04.27]Oh, I'm an idiot.
[246:05.04]I could have just teleported there.
[246:06.45]I was too busy talking about Fortnite.
[246:09.21]Hold on, give me a second.
[246:17.35]Hold on give me a second.
[246:26.78]Make the eye poke a finisher?
[246:29.29]Are there finishing moves in Fortnite?
[246:40.25]Do people still like Fortnite?
[246:42.82]Is it still played?
[246:43.66]I feel like that's kind of one of those games that I'm just...
[246:47.05]I don't know if people actually like it or not.
[246:53.68]Alright, let's go.
[246:54.28]I think there's more to see here.
[247:16.57]Don't mind me.
[247:17.23]Sorry.
[247:17.84]I could teleport to where I want to go.
[247:27.45]Skibidi Toilet's getting a movie.
[247:29.00]I think the Sus guy.
[247:30.17]Yeah, it's... Did we talk about this yet?
[247:32.70]About how...
[247:34.74]You hit that point when you know that you're kind of too old for stuff.
[247:42.37]I had moments where I said,
[247:45.91]What are we fucking talking about?
[247:49.12]A Skibidi Toilet movie?
[247:52.74]Skibidi Toilet toys?
[247:55.70]It was that moment when I knew that I am older.
[247:58.58]I actually have gotten older, a lot older.
[248:02.89]I feel that way and I'm 20.
[248:04.93]I'm 23 and I feel that way.
[248:10.87]So you guys have that too?
[248:12.70]Alright, so does that mean it's a universal issue?
[248:15.66]Because if I'm 40 and I go, what the fuck is going on?
[248:18.04]And you're 20 and you're like, what is going on?
[248:20.94]I feel like that's a universal connection of generations.
[248:24.03]On the what's going on with the Skibidi Toilet shit.
[248:28.18]It's not an age thing.
[248:29.27]It's just a weird problem.
[248:32.69]We have a major problem on our hands.
[248:35.22]If we can get the two generations to agree on that.
[248:42.85]Dude, imagine connecting the generations together over the equal, confused, sort of half-hatred of Skibidi Toilet.
[248:55.03]Skibidi Toilet is for like six year olds.
[248:58.15]Is it for, I don't, is sick, I don't think so.
[249:02.19]Isn't there like a bunch of like punching and kicking and like violence and machine guns and stuff?
[249:07.80]When I was six, I don't remember watching stuff like that.
[249:12.41]I was like counting with fucking Grover.
[249:18.30]I was counting with the count in Sesame Street.
[249:20.50]I wasn't watching people get obliterated by machine guns.
[249:27.11]Isn't it like a giant war?
[249:28.96]It's like the TVs versus the cameras versus the toilets.
[249:34.33]I remember watching
[249:36.86]because I was curious this is like years ago at this point I watched episode 1 through 20 or 1 through 30 whatever was currently available
[249:46.38]And after, episode like 15, one through 15, I was like, okay, whatever, I get it.
[249:52.42]It's a funny toilet guy.
[249:53.49]Guy's head coming out of the toilet.
[249:55.23]Skibidi dum bum bum.
[249:56.98]Yes, yes, whatever.
[249:57.82]Okay, haha.
[249:58.43]It's a funny little meme.
[249:59.51]But then like when it just became like every video after video 30 was just like war footage.
[250:07.69]It's like episode 31 was like war.
[250:09.16]32 was like war footage.
[250:10.76]33 was like war footage.
[250:12.97]It's just like every single episode became just like a bigger explosion.
[250:18.48]this 20 episodes?
[250:19.40]This is like a hundred something.
[250:21.46]How many episodes are there?
[250:31.67]Ask Vinny.
[250:38.68]Michael Bay has creative control of the series now?
[250:44.95]Alright, if I was Michael Bay and I got creative control and I took it over, I would just record myself just flushing the rights down the toilet.
[250:52.35]Do you know what I'm saying?
[250:53.59]That's how you close that arc.
[250:55.80]With the song playing, right?
[250:59.75]Yeah, it would be such a huge piece.
[251:01.14]It'd be like, look, we're at the toilet.
[251:04.47]His head should be in the toilet.
[251:06.57]Like, eating the rights.
[251:10.69]And then he goes and he flushes down and then it pans over and it's a camera guy.
[251:16.95]And he does the thumbs up.
[251:19.03]What the fuck, and then the next episode?
[251:21.11]It's a war!
[251:26.09]What did you smoke today?
[251:27.06]Nothing.
[251:31.48]Alright, let's go back to the hedge maze.
[251:37.82]Is that the only way I can get down there?
[251:39.62]I think this is the right one, because, yeah, it's right here.
[251:49.25]I keep thinking that's my dog.
[251:50.91]I'm sorry.
[251:57.17]Alright, let's do it.
[252:05.20]I can't believe it.
[252:06.52]You've gotten the eye back.
[252:08.59]I apologize for the deception of this mask.
[252:11.28]Allow me to properly introduce myself.
[252:13.65]I am Peter Mostyn.
[252:16.18]Yes, that sarcophagus is my sarcophagus over there.
[252:20.08]I'm dead in the real world.
[252:21.68]Allow me to explain.
[252:23.69]My twin sister Priscilla and I have been interested in magic since we were children.
[252:29.87]We always hoped to find a way to contact our dear deceased mother, but nothing worked.
[252:35.71]It wasn't until 1874 that we finally found real magic.
[252:40.30]We were invited on a diplomatic trip to visit Constantinople, the ancient city of Byzantium.
[252:48.02]While my father worked to ingratiate himself with the politicians of the world we had traveled with,
[252:56.31]Priscilla and I searched for artifacts to purchase.
[253:00.61]After many encounters with shady merchants and frauds, we were finally shown this idol with ruby eyes.
[253:08.39]The price was high, but we were promised miraculous effects, so the idol was purchased.
[253:14.96]That night, Priscilla and I awoke in the dream for the first time.
[253:20.05]You see, this idol is the source of the dream, and it recreates anything its ruby eyes see.
[253:28.46]The idol is a painter of sorts.
[253:30.88]It tries to portray its subjects accurately, but is prone to extrapolation and flights of fancy.
[253:38.62]Once its ruby gaze has fallen upon someone, it will incorporate them into the dream.
[253:44.30]Father had caught a fever shortly after we arrived at Constantinople.
[253:48.64]Only a few days after purchasing the idol, Priscilla showed symptoms of the fever as well.
[253:54.33]Within a fortnight, they were both dead.
[254:00.06]My grief, as you can imagine, was boundless.
[254:02.81]But to my utter astonishment, Priscilla was still alive in the dream.
[254:07.35]The idol did not know of her death.
[254:10.59]I returned home to Mostyn House with the bodies and the idol.
[254:14.56]And as I showed the idol more of the house and of life, the dream grew grander.
[254:21.01]I was able to convince the idol that magic exists with some simple parlor tricks and pyrotechnics.
[254:27.50]In the dream, my sister and I slowly created a Paradise.
[254:32.75]Of course, even with magic in the dream, we never were able to meet Mother.
[254:37.35]The idol had never seen her.
[254:41.19]As you have seen, Dr. Blackett and his henchmen have turned the dream into a nightmare.
[254:45.86]It is time to end the dream by destroying the idol's representation of itself in the dream.
[254:51.18]Thank you for returning the eye.
[254:54.63]I'm too weak.
[254:55.33]I'm too weak to have done it myself.
[254:57.46]Now let me prepare the destruction spell.
[255:06.06]Oh, Peter, you've finally let down your guard for a moment.
[255:10.12]You've been quite a naughty boy, haven't you?
[255:14.74]Excellent work, Mr.
[255:16.81]Wretch."
[255:18.40]Peter, my old friend.
[255:20.99]How far have you fallen?
[255:23.32]I tried to help you.
[255:25.21]Why would you try to destroy the dream?
[255:27.80]Collect the ashes for the erasure ritual.
[255:30.40]Peter shall cause us no more trouble.
[255:34.01]Take the girl to the observatory.
[255:36.24]I have other matters to attend to.
[255:41.40]What could be more important for a villain than the culmination of every single villainous thing he's ever done?
[255:49.62]What is it that...
[255:52.92]compels them to leave during moments of intense, unbelievable climax of what they have desired and what they're trying to do.
[256:03.01]What is...
[256:03.86]I don't know.
[256:04.37]But this happens to most villains.
[256:12.50]Everything I've ever worked for.
[256:14.19]There you are.
[256:15.24]I've got you.
[256:16.20]You're in my grasp.
[256:17.91]I'll be back in a few hours.
[256:23.96]Here we go.
[256:27.03]Monster House 1892 in a dream.
[256:28.60]Nightingale is taken to the observatory in the attic.
[256:31.94]Eventually, the wretch's sleep spell begins to wane.
[256:34.91]She awakens to find a letter at the foot of her bed.
[256:42.81]Find a way to escape the observatory.
[256:50.70]Nightingale, I'm terribly sorry for the frightful events you bore witness to.
[256:55.70]Peter was a sick man, determined to destroy the dream even if it meant forever snuffing out its inhabitants.
[257:02.47]I understand you must be alarmed and confused.
[257:05.80]It would not surprise me if you think me a monster.
[257:08.96]I must assure you, these are slanderous falsehoods, and that no harm shall come to you in the dream.
[257:16.00]I'm afraid I have pressing business to attend to, so I'm going to stop the letter right now.
[257:22.60]Even in the note, there's something else he's got to do.
[257:26.87]I love that.
[257:28.49]Please remain safely in the observatory until I return and I will explain everything.
[257:33.93]Your friend, Dr. Robert Blackett.
[257:38.17]He's aura farming.
[257:39.54]How many chapters are there?
[257:40.56]A lot.
[257:41.99]I think there's at least four or five.
[257:44.38]This game is deceivingly long.
[257:46.95]It's kind of a whole experience.
[257:50.41]Well, stay in the observatory.
[257:51.79]That's what he said.
[257:56.25]Yeah, well, I have access to the mirror.
[258:00.58]Last night's counts.
[258:06.47]Dude tonic poison yep Make a bunch of poison bunch of acid
[258:16.18]You gonna stream the whole game?
[258:18.71]I'm thinking about it.
[258:20.22]I think that's probably the... the plan, yeah?
[258:27.01]I kind of want to have a little game to play.
[258:34.23]So what do you guys think?
[258:36.90]I mean, we're kind of through the first arc.
[258:38.39]We're about maybe 10 to 15% of the way through the game.
[258:40.60]Maybe like 15 to 20-ish.
[258:47.44]It's interesting.
[258:48.23]It's good.
[258:48.59]I think it's great.
[258:51.77]I think the reason why I like this game so much is because...
[258:56.29]I'm gonna use the word unique because I'm going to.
[258:59.79]I love when games, or even TV shows or movies,
[259:04.27]where you really kind of don't really know what's going to happen next.
[259:07.31]And I know, yeah, but you're going to walk through a hallway and there's going to be a monster.
[259:11.12]But it has a unique way of playing.
[259:13.49]It has a unique story.
[259:14.90]It has a unique...
[259:15.84]It's just a unique game.
[259:20.65]It keeps my attention.
[259:25.68]And really, that's really all I care about in games.
[259:29.31]Because I'm so ADHD, I'm so all over the place that when something actually keeps my attention, it's like, whoa, wait a minute.
[259:35.51]That's weird.
[259:37.46]Why do I want to pay attention to this more?
[259:41.04]So it actually, it's not that it's rare.
[259:43.19]I mean, quite a few things hold my attention, but when something kind of locks you in and kind of gets you,
[259:51.89]This game did it to me, and I figured, why is it doing that?
[260:01.22]Alright, here we gotta do a puzzle here.
[260:06.01]Do I have the information to do the puzzle?
[260:09.78]Does dispatch seem interesting to you?
[260:13.60]Uh, no.
[260:14.59]I'll be honest, no.
[260:15.64]Not really.
[260:24.00]I don't know, I...
[260:27.45]Okay.
[260:28.52]Before we do any more.
[260:32.14]I think...
[260:33.79]I just kind of think I'm over the kind of Telltale-esque games.
[260:39.09]And I think that's not that I think Dispatch is going to be like that, because obviously it's by the Wolf Among Us people, right?
[260:45.87]But I think playing all like through five, six, seven of those Telltale kind of games, it's just like, I don't really care about this kind of experience that much anymore.
[260:55.86]and I'm a choose your own adventure junkie but they always even the best of those kind of games always kind of feels like
[261:07.05]Here's characters.
[261:08.62]You're going to meet these characters and you're going to have to decide between two of them.
[261:15.42]Those, look at this person.
[261:17.01]That person's got an interesting backstory.
[261:18.61]That person has an interesting backstory too.
[261:20.72]You're ready to pick between who, which one of those you like more.
[261:24.47]That's kind of what the entire genre was baked around.
[261:30.15]It's like, oh, they've introduced two new characters this chapter.
[261:32.84]Okay, which one of them is going to fall off of a train?
[261:35.25]And, oh no, I could have saved that one by, but it's like just picking between two people every chapter.
[261:40.14]Yeah, oh no, they're both in peril, exactly.
[261:45.04]And I can't... That kind of storytelling, I think, is...
[261:50.34]And again, I've not seen a second of dispatch.
[261:52.77]It could be incredible.
[261:53.48]It could be not this at all.
[261:55.57]But I don't like knowing from the very beginning what the potential outcome is probably going to be.
[262:07.09]From episode one, being able to kind of see the plot points and where they're going to go,
[262:14.03]I like just being surprised.
[262:16.17]I like having being told a story.
[262:25.59]It is literally that, however really high quality writing and animation.
[262:29.12]I mean, it looks great.
[262:30.48]The...
[262:31.85]If you talk about animation, it looks fantastic.
[262:34.95]That's for sure.
[262:35.60]Okay, let me do this first.
[262:41.06]Far fewer visible stars than real Earth.
[262:43.79]Unclear if this is an acuity issue in the idol's eyes, or a flawed early imprint that's stuck.
[262:50.46]Subsequent exposure in the real world does not improve the situation.
[262:54.12]Alright.
[262:55.24]So 1, 2, 3 is...
[262:56.89]There's a grid.
[262:59.40]I think if I can recall this.
[263:01.02]So we've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 across.
[263:07.94]Okay, 10 across, 10 down.
[263:10.33]So that would mean... 1 would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 up.
[263:17.75]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[263:20.99]6 up, 10 right, right?
[263:29.97]6 up, 10 right.
[263:35.17]So that's 1, 2, 3, that's 4.
[263:39.89]And the other one was right above it, right?
[263:43.94]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[263:48.38]Wait, 710?
[263:49.52]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[263:54.23]710.
[263:57.44]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[263:59.87]Fuck you!
[264:01.60]Yeah, that's one of the most...
[264:05.49]It's like saying one, two, three.
[264:07.21]One, two.
[264:08.40]It's like saying two, three.
[264:09.62]It's a number sequence that is an incredibly popular number sequence.
[264:14.67]I think that's why everybody loves it and thinks it's funny because it's like, oh, look, you said the thing that we came after the other one.
[264:26.89]I don't think anyone thinks it's funny.
[264:28.41]How old are you?
[264:29.70]I'm 40.
[264:30.12]Are you 20?
[264:32.72]Are we all agreeing?
[264:33.74]Is this a Skibidi thing?
[264:44.64]25 yes.
[264:45.46]20 yes.
[264:46.55]26 yes.
[264:54.93]Alright.
[264:57.62]I'm just...
[264:57.86]I know... Look, don't do this.
[264:59.11]I can't even make this joke because somebody's gonna get fucking permanently banned.
[265:02.40]You know what I'm saying?
[265:04.21]I'm waiting for the one person to say, no, you're wrong.
[265:07.56]I can't.
[265:10.97]No, no, no.
[265:11.27]I can't do it.
[265:12.22]I can't.
[265:12.62]This is a studio.
[265:13.32]You can't even make this joke.
[265:19.82]You actually can't make this joke because it permanently bans you.
[265:26.03]I don't fuck around.
[265:27.36]I don't.
[265:27.91]Just let's move on because you have no idea what I'm talking about.
[265:29.99]If you do, you do.
[265:30.59]If you don't, you don't.
[265:35.04]but the joke was around somebody disagreeing with that.
[265:38.55]Alright, so what the hell?
[265:44.90]Let me look at this again.
[265:45.68]Without... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[265:50.44]After 6.
[265:52.66]So it'll be...
[265:55.63]Six, fucking, I need to say it.
[265:58.36]I'm just, I don't care.
[265:59.47]I'm not 11, okay?
[266:02.06]It would be 6, 10, 7, 10, 8, 10, right?
[266:14.83]So six.
[266:16.49]So that's four, two, two.
[266:27.10]Thank you very much.
[266:37.30]We need to get corporate America to incorporate 6-7 into a meme.
[266:40.45]Oh my god.
[266:42.04]No, we don't.
[266:42.68]I don't want... You don't want that.
[266:44.99]You really don't.
[266:47.05]Okay, large cursed snuff box.
[266:54.05]That's a way to build up curse.
[266:55.14]Mirror Shield!
[266:56.83]A mirror with a handle attached that can be used as a shield can block all incoming curse damage, but will eventually break.
[267:03.11]Poise increases effectiveness.
[267:07.06]And here is a...
[267:10.20]A little bit of a secret.
[267:11.83]It's a secret in the entrance hall, apparently.
[267:14.15]Find out why there's a question mark below the entrance hall on Mostyn House map.
[267:21.12]Alright.
[267:24.52]We can't go that way.
[267:28.16]Try to put the shield on.
[267:35.33]Get me out of here.
[267:46.57]How do I get out of here?
[268:03.26]Should I die?
[268:05.80]I forget what you do here.
[268:06.77]How do I get out of here?
[268:11.52]Yeah, I opened that.
[268:16.17]Is it both locked?
[268:18.15]Didn't it say to stay there?
[268:19.18]Maybe I can sleep?
[268:25.67]The moment old senators are joking about 6-7, you know it's over.
[268:30.44]Oh, I can get out of here.
[268:31.15]I can get out of here.
[268:32.73]Yeah, I gotta just get cursed.
[268:42.71]Yeah, there we go.
[268:47.83]I'm back.
[268:51.04]What?
[268:59.33]Well, isn't this awkward?
[269:01.20]I know you're probably not too pleased to see me, but unlikely as it may sound, we're on the same side.
[269:07.62]You see, me and the butcher surgeon had an uneasy alliance.
[269:13.94]He would guard the eye and I would guard the idol.
[269:18.28]That's an Omega raid.
[269:21.86]It's a raid from Lymes.
[269:23.21]Hey, Lymes!
[269:25.02]Thanks for the raid.
[269:27.83]Welcome, everybody.
[269:29.40]Appreciate it.
[269:32.95]Hello, hello.
[269:37.69]We are playing one of my favorite games in the last couple of years.
[269:44.12]This is Withering Rooms.
[269:47.78]If you're going to stick around, cool.
[269:50.26]If not, go check it out on Steam.
[269:51.76]Seriously, before you leave.
[269:53.79]If you're like, hey, that was cool.
[269:54.99]Lime's had a good stream.
[269:55.82]See you later.
[269:56.52]Go check this out on Steam.
[269:57.55]Withering Rooms.
[269:59.60]It's a good game.
[270:00.70]It's good shit.
[270:03.74]She played it, what?
[270:06.48]Did she stream this?
[270:07.23]Wait, is there a stream of limes playing this?
[270:14.21]I liked this game a lot.
[270:16.14]What?
[270:17.00]Holy shit.
[270:18.35]Guys, there's other people that like this game, I told you.
[270:22.02]A while ago.
[270:23.59]I didn't get to finish it, but I really enjoyed it.
[270:25.20]I've been meaning to go back.
[270:27.07]Oh, nice.
[270:29.66]The more people that play this game, the better.
[270:32.09]That's cool.
[270:35.45]Well, yeah, thanks for the ride.
[270:43.08]Dude, you're draining the battery on my iPad.
[270:45.29]Plug your iPad in!
[270:46.56]No, get off the iPad!
[270:50.37]Get off the iPad and do like jumping jacks in your fucking room for an hour.
[270:54.64]No, don't do that for an hour.
[270:55.90]I'm just trying to say 10 minutes.
[270:58.89]Sorry.
[271:00.10]I use the iPad a lot too.
[271:02.66]I can't throw stones at a glass house.
[271:07.84]But here's how I use the iPad.
[271:11.50]Do you know what one of my favorite things in the world is?
[271:13.61]I know you guys already know my favorite YouTube channels.
[271:17.79]Nile Red, Nile Blue.
[271:20.29]Everything Niall.
[271:23.02]He makes, I'm gonna make grape soda out of latex gloves.
[271:27.17]It's just like, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my whole life.
[271:31.95]I will, to wind down, I will put on a Nile Red experiment video.
[271:37.95]And I'm just like, this is, I love this.
[271:39.40]This is great.
[271:41.26]Oh man, that didn't work the way he wanted to.
[271:44.22]He's got to figure something else out.
[271:46.28]It's like a drama unfolding because sometimes it doesn't work and he has to figure out how to get the chemical extraction the right way.
[271:58.41]It's great.
[272:02.44]I turned lead into gold.
[272:07.37]But yeah, that's the iPad.
[272:10.33]My iPad time is...
[272:13.34]Yeah, dude, if I see that Niall Redd has a new video, I'm just like, oh man, what did he cook up this time?
[272:19.95]So, there you go.
[272:21.37]But get off the iPad.
[272:26.73]Okay, so here we go.
[272:27.78]Peter Mostyn wanted to destroy the dream.
[272:31.33]Robert Blackett wants to turn the dream into his plaything.
[272:35.40]Not a fan of either outcome.
[272:36.95]So I worked with the butcher to keep the idol out of their hands.
[272:40.37]So that was bad.
[272:41.29]We shouldn't have killed him.
[272:43.63]I was convinced you were one of Robert's lackeys.
[272:47.13]And can you blame me?
[272:48.82]You did everything they asked, whether you knew it or not.
[272:52.27]But now that you've been locked up in the observatory, I can see you're not aligned with them, at least not yet.
[272:58.14]As a gesture of good faith, here's the key to your prison.
[273:02.13]Now that Robert has full control of the idol again, we're in tremendous danger.
[273:05.60]We need to find out what he is planning.
[273:08.74]There are two places that might have the answer, Robert's room and the entrance hall.
[273:20.88]Have you been to the wrong room?
[273:23.01]You just open and close the door three times then go in.
[273:25.16]Yeah, I did that already.
[273:26.68]It's a spell my friend Millie came up with.
[273:29.33]The spell creates a false version of a room in the mansion.
[273:32.44]We used to pull great pranks on the other initiates by luring them into it.
[273:36.64]The last prank we pulled was pointing the wrong room at the entrance hall during an initiation ceremony.
[273:43.22]Oh.
[273:44.73]Not long after, I saw Millie in the hallway, but she was a ghost.
[273:48.37]The wrong room, as you can see for yourself, has become a cursed place.
[273:51.89]That means the entrance hall must be a cursed place too.
[273:54.44]What happened in there?
[273:56.45]Millie and 12 other people are now ghosts, and I know Robert had something to do with it.
[274:02.02]The first witch has something to do with it as well.
[274:04.60]I overheard her talking about creating a binding spell for something in the entrance hall.
[274:12.50]Doubtless she'd keep something so valuable on her person.
[274:15.93]So you'll have to defeat her to get your hands on it.
[274:20.75]I work at Dunkin' and made your blueberry coffee.
[274:23.36]And what is the verdict?
[274:26.18]Robert's room is along the upper hallway.
[274:28.25]You should search his room thoroughly.
[274:29.64]I know he's hiding something.
[274:30.78]Be careful, though.
[274:31.99]There's lots of initiates about.
[274:33.90]They, like the First Witch, have hardened their bodies against the effects of being cursed.
[274:38.05]Keep your eye out for an Initiate's Grimoire.
[274:41.95]There are loads of spells in there that do physical damage instead of curse damage.
[274:46.38]I'll bet the First Witch has one hidden in her bedroom.
[274:51.50]What do you sell?
[274:55.03]A whip.
[274:58.16]Spirit dust.
[275:01.72]Interesting.
[275:05.68]Ooh, alright.
[275:06.61]It's time to make the decision.
[275:09.60]I could go total glass cannon and do like 100% more spell damage and just go all in on spells.
[275:19.78]and die in like one hit.
[275:24.84]Or...
[275:26.54]I can't make the decision yet.
[275:27.97]I don't know.
[275:32.35]Ooh, give me some of these actually.
[275:36.72]A blank black book which can be stamped with a sigil to create spells.
[275:40.96]Okay, we need the Initiate's Grimoire.
[275:44.95]Grimoire.
[275:47.02]Grimoire Grimoire Grimoire Grimoire
[276:05.92]Hello.
[276:10.15]I got two left.
[276:11.15]They're expensive.
[276:13.72]I don't want to sell these.
[276:15.38]Oh, actually, he buys them because it's a ghost, right?
[276:17.41]Oh, he does buy them.
[276:19.44]That's a ghost right there.
[276:21.28]That's a cool picture, though.
[276:22.05]I should hang it up.
[276:24.42]What is this picture of?
[276:34.70]Cool.
[276:38.69]As a kid, I used to pray to God to make me a warrior cat, and when it didn't happen, I got so mad I stopped being a Christian.
[276:49.96]Okay.
[277:12.71]Why did you read that like it was in-game dialog?
[277:14.80]Because I was still on that mode.
[277:16.39]I was still on talk dialog mode.
[277:21.58]I saw somebody say, I think, I don't know if it was a chat comment or if it was a...
[277:26.15]I think it was a chat comment that I saw from the VOD.
[277:28.16]Because I looked back at the VOD yesterday, just seeing the other perspectives of the Thanksgiving video.
[277:35.10]I think I said, I forget whose stream I was watching, but they said, Jerma talks to these guys like they are in his audience.
[277:43.80]Ha ha ha.
[277:46.68]Like, they're audience members, and I was like, oh, what the fuck?
[277:49.77]Do I do that?
[277:55.39]I said that.
[278:00.43]I just get too enthusiastic about things.
[278:03.31]Alright.
[278:06.30]So it's a new day.
[278:14.62]Alright, so what are the quests I have?
[278:15.89]Let me see.
[278:18.40]I got a lot of stuff.
[278:22.20]Okay, defeat the first witch in the upper banquet hall.
[278:25.27]Explore Robert's room.
[278:30.60]Okay, so we gotta go up to... Let's do Upper Banquet Hall, see if we can get there.
[278:46.99]Where's the banquet hall?
[278:49.07]I think it's down there.
[278:52.02]What the fuck?
[278:53.38]Oh my god!
[278:54.02]Uh, I need the camera.
[279:01.35]Oh, fuck!
[279:02.15]Did I take a picture of it hitting me in the head?
[279:03.44]I got him.
[279:05.91]Thanks for ducking.
[279:12.05]Physician ghost?
[279:14.43]Geez man, I'm gonna die!
[279:19.86]Fuck you!
[279:21.47]I'm dead!
[279:21.85]I just barely got that off.
[279:28.75]This guy is crazy.
[279:36.72]This guy is insane.
[279:54.86]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up!
[279:59.79]Oh my god!
[280:01.15]Crazy guy, out of the... A ghoul.
[280:11.63]Let me see, this is stupid.
[280:20.58]Wait a minute.
[280:22.08]I have the... Set it to 12 o'clock?
[280:26.41]You set the clock to midnight.
[280:36.67]Um...
[280:45.11]I think I just summoned the entire fucking video game.
[280:52.64]Just take everything, whether I'll... Oh my god, what have I done?
[280:57.69]Close it!
[281:07.74]Uh...
[281:10.28]I need more offense.
[281:16.77]Please kill each other.
[281:17.85]Kill each other.
[281:20.67]Shoot him.
[281:21.17]Shoot him.
[281:22.15]Shoot her!
[281:23.22]Shoot him!
[281:25.75]Shoot her!
[281:26.67]Shoot him!
[281:28.90]Oh, fuck!
[281:33.04]Alright, he's poisoning people.
[281:39.13]Oh my goodness.
[281:40.37]Hold on.
[281:40.90]Eat that.
[281:45.41]There's people shooting fucking spells at me.
[281:50.74]Stay back!
[281:57.04]They're actually killing each other.
[281:58.76]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[282:04.69]Ow!
[282:08.41]Fuck you!
[282:10.64]Am I poisoned?
[282:12.34]Okay, I'm bleeding.
[282:15.87]That actually kind of worked out in a weird way.
[282:34.45]Ow!
[282:47.76]Stay in the corner.
[282:51.49]I lucked out.
[282:53.56]Actually, it was not a bad idea to summon everybody to the room because they all just murdered each other.
[283:00.55]Possession book.
[283:06.74]Oh, the initiate book will become possessed and follow the caster.
[283:09.61]It's a little familiar.
[283:10.34]That was an upper initiate.
[283:19.32]Alright, that's money.
[283:23.85]There's a chest in here too.
[283:24.82]I think it was a guarded chest.
[283:26.56]Yeah.
[283:27.75]So what was it?
[283:31.30]Yes.
[283:33.05]10% spell damage, inner light, 100 perception.
[283:41.44]This thing is amazing Amulet
[283:48.93]Oh, that's kind of crazy.
[283:50.96]I have like plus 80% spell damage here.
[283:57.93]Fucking hate it.
[284:00.10]I hate when it does that.
[284:02.72]Put a candle down.
[284:15.12]Somebody said poke gagging on the burger made me sick.
[284:21.50]I've watched it a couple times since.
[284:24.96]I love that video.
[284:26.01]It's just so stupid.
[284:30.12]One of my favorite parts of the whole video is the very beginning when Poke is...
[284:35.84]Okay, so when people send videos to me,
[284:39.13]It's like, okay, everybody just kind of sync up, queue up your videos so I can know when you're starting.
[284:45.85]And Pogue goes, hey, what I'm going to do is I'm going to tap the table.
[284:48.28]That's how you know to start my 15 minutes.
[284:52.29]I'm going to see what I can do.
[284:53.49]But that's where I'm starting.
[284:55.20]uh I left it in because he kind of does like uh getting ready he taps the table and then he does this like smirk where he kind of gets into character
[285:05.19]And he does like a little, like, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[285:09.65]So he's setting up, setting up, taps the table, instantly gets into character.
[285:13.56]It's like my favorite part of the whole video.
[285:22.98]Alright, so we gotta go to the entrance hall.
[285:24.26]15 minutes?
[285:27.96]It felt like 3 hours.
[285:29.55]Good.
[285:34.89]There's probably another monster here.
[285:39.73]Let me put that new fit on.
[285:46.09]5 max health or less poison.
[285:48.34]I don't really care about poison right now.
[285:54.16]Okay, cool.
[285:56.85]Looks pretty good.
[286:06.88]painting gallery, guest bedroom.
[286:15.71]No.
[286:16.12]Alright.
[286:16.34]I want to go to the entrance hall.
[286:25.89]And I thought somebody was gonna get McDonald's.
[286:28.82]I really thought that was what was gonna happen.
[286:32.42]but I wasn't totally confident in being able to say, oh, looks like you got the McDonald's.
[286:38.18]Wow, really, really like, not rude of you.
[286:42.52]I couldn't commit to it though.
[286:44.59]But even if I was wrong, it would have been funny.
[286:49.19]Okay, here we go.
[286:49.79]This is a banquet hall.
[286:55.01]I kind of, is the entrance hall this way?
[287:01.12]Let's see if I can get over here.
[287:02.56]This door is locked, right?
[287:08.34]I don't know if I can open this.
[287:10.48]I can.
[287:10.91]Okay, so here's the...
[287:22.62]I gotta get something besides a lead pipe for a weapon.
[287:43.36]That's fine.
[287:48.43]Oh.
[287:51.43]Good.
[287:52.91]Okay.
[287:53.03]Entrance hall.
[287:55.97]I think...
[287:56.37]Isn't it...
[287:56.63]It's this way, right?
[287:58.26]West stairwell basement...
[288:01.40]Where is the entrance hall?
[288:07.32]Have I not found the entrance hall yet?
[288:08.60]I have that thing.
[288:10.59]Where is it?
[288:13.03]okay banquet hall and then it's to the left of the banquet hall I don't think I can get over there yet
[288:24.30]Because Banquet Hall's there.
[288:25.50]You little shit.
[288:30.67]Give me that.
[288:37.41]Yeah, it's this way.
[288:39.48]Okay, I need a key to get in there.
[288:41.53]Does somebody have the key?
[288:45.97]Oh shit, okay.
[288:53.74]Robert Blackett's room.
[288:56.39]Where was his room?
[289:03.38]I think it's probably up, right?
[289:05.61]Observatory.
[289:10.51]This is the second chapter.
[289:14.25]Where is his room?
[289:29.49]Oh, hello.
[289:31.88]Are you friendly?
[289:33.31]Wait, okay, no, I think he's friendly.
[289:35.66]Hello there.
[289:36.71]You're the one who cleared that surgeon out of here, aren't you?
[289:39.56]My sincere thanks.
[289:41.21]I arrived on the train just a few nights ago and only to find my usual haunt occupied by that brute.
[289:48.09]The name is Thomas.
[289:49.55]Just a humble merchant trying to make my way through the dream.
[289:53.41]As a thank you, I'll show you some items you won't find anywhere else.
[289:58.22]Oh, hold on.
[289:59.95]Front door key.
[290:03.13]Wait, he wants organ grease.
[290:07.54]I get a wig.
[290:18.05]These are not expensive.
[290:23.13]Wait.
[290:24.67]Oh dear, it was expensive.
[290:26.86]It was 50 coins.
[290:29.63]It was the most expensive thing in the store.
[290:36.28]I actually kind of like this though.
[290:38.72]Ooh.
[290:42.30]I like it.
[290:43.61]But...
[290:45.04]Okay, stay where you are because I need more money because I want to come back and buy this.
[290:50.69]No, don't do that.
[290:55.03]Okay, this is still the basement.
[290:57.24]Let me just get a bunch of shit.
[290:58.82]I'm gonna do a loot run.
[291:06.52]This thing has terrible poise.
[291:14.16]Fuck.
[291:15.74]Come on out.
[291:24.24]Where's the anti-poison?
[291:25.38]Do I even have an antidote?
[291:26.23]I don't think I even have an antidote.
[291:28.44]Yeah, I do.
[291:34.80]Somebody's coming.
[291:41.68]Nothing in the toilet.
[291:43.12]Just pick up a ton of shit.
[291:47.30]That's good.
[291:51.84]Alright, mine- Nah, I don't wanna- I don't wanna fuck with you.
[291:58.66]Get away from me.
[292:02.04]Hmm, alright, so how do I get up to his bedroom?
[292:06.98]Progress is slow, I have no pupils.
[292:09.09]The dream has become overrun with disgusting, disease-ridden corpses.
[292:13.58]That wretched butcher surgeon turned the dream into a nightmare and now has the audacity to linger here.
[292:19.74]He claims Dr. Blackett hired him, but I cannot believe God would mislead one of his chosen ones.
[292:25.52]We need fresh inhabitants, free of disease, with minds open to Christ's wonders.
[292:34.40]Okay.
[292:37.37]Is there a stamina bar?
[292:39.70]No, I don't think there is.
[292:45.44]Ohhhh!
[292:56.86]Jesus.
[293:02.71]Okay.
[293:12.00]Well, I'm gonna keep looking here.
[293:13.84]Because I have a ton of materials now.
[293:20.56]Isn't this the first witch?
[293:22.88]Aren't we supposed to kill her?
[293:24.48]And she's now kind of mad at us, right?
[293:33.04]I have plenty of those.
[293:33.90]I want more of these.
[293:49.31]Should I heal?
[293:58.76]Okay.
[294:00.77]What's in here?
[294:03.44]Bathroom.
[294:04.37]There's gonna be an asshole in that cabinet.
[294:10.71]Watch this.
[294:11.49]Boom.
[294:12.14]Nope.
[294:13.50]Boom.
[294:14.67]Nope.
[294:15.26]Okay.
[294:16.46]Well...
[294:21.25]You gonna play Chibi-Robo?
[294:23.46]Uh, I did play Chibi-Robo, that's right.
[294:26.62]I played it quite a long time ago.
[294:31.26]I saw it was added to the switch, um... Whatever the hell that thing is.
[294:35.81]The switch... to...
[294:39.13]Um, emulator thingy, whatever it is.
[294:41.64]Okay.
[294:54.52]Okay.
[294:55.84]Give me everything.
[295:03.78]Painting gallery.
[295:04.64]What?
[295:04.80]Did I not go in here?
[295:10.19]What the fuck are you doing in here?
[295:18.16]I don't need an axe.
[295:20.05]I'm gonna try to kill this guy.
[295:20.99]How scary is he really?
[295:24.33]Alright, he's pretty scary.
[295:26.86]I will get a new item for killing him though.
[295:30.94]He has a huge hitbox.
[295:34.27]Oh my... Nope, goodbye.
[295:40.23]I just want to see if there's anything in there.
[295:49.54]We're fine.
[296:00.65]Check everything.
[296:01.39]I'm not gonna get jumped by somebody.
[296:07.50]Okay.
[296:07.62]Alright, we'll do East stairwell, maybe.
[296:18.37]Because this is to the outside.
[296:20.82]This is down to the basement.
[296:28.56]How do I get up to his room?
[296:30.94]Oh, what the heck?
[296:33.17]She gave me the key!
[296:39.73]There's no handle.
[296:44.98]She gave me the key.
[296:46.72]Okay, goodbye.
[296:48.69]Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye.
[296:50.42]What the f- I just closed the door on myself.
[296:53.23]That was great.
[297:00.05]Oh, um... Goodbye.
[297:05.95]Oh, Alfred, I'm sorry.
[297:15.40]Alright.
[297:16.86]What am I doing?
[297:17.47]I have the key to get out of there.
[297:25.19]Falling asleep to this cozy stream.
[297:27.59]Hey, that's fine with me.
[297:32.80]I sell this rotten meat.
[297:34.75]Look at all this stuff I have.
[297:35.57]Get rid of half of this.
[297:36.33]I don't need any of this anymore.
[297:41.15]I'm gonna put this on.
[297:43.87]Uh, I need to level up.
[297:51.17]You know what I mean?
[297:57.91]I'm going down here because I need to find the witch.
[298:01.53]Will I should be hostile?
[298:02.36]I don't remember.
[298:04.27]But I need to level up.
[298:12.86]See if I can find her in here.
[298:21.99]Give me all the heals.
[298:27.04]I have so many projectiles now.
[298:33.50]Excuse me.
[298:34.03]Wait, there's a chest over there.
[298:44.93]Spoiler room.
[298:45.59]We already did this.
[298:47.56]But... Oops.
[298:51.79]Yep.
[298:52.90]Yep.
[298:53.67]Goodbye.
[298:55.20]No!
[298:56.71]Dodge!
[299:10.58]Where is the witch?
[299:21.39]Where's the witch?
[299:24.60]Shit.
[299:28.88]Where's the witch?
[299:32.72]Where is she?
[299:35.37]A cult library?
[299:40.40]Is it?
[299:40.61]I think it's a cult library.
[299:43.21]The Level Up Witch.
[299:44.06]I forget what she was.
[299:46.08]I think it's a cult librarian.
[299:53.29]Because that way, is that where the, I think that's where the wretched one was.
[300:04.80]Because I need to level up.
[300:05.63]Let me see if she's there.
[300:22.46]Use the shrine?
[300:23.21]I don't think you can.
[300:25.16]She isn't there.
[300:30.92]Like, I have a remembrance tier, but... Where's the witch?
[300:36.83]Because she could level me up.
[300:40.40]I definitely want to keep that spell damage necklace.
[300:51.12]I forget where the witch is because I want to level up before I keep going.
[300:57.30]Did I lose my opportunity?
[300:59.21]That's very possible.
[301:03.79]What the fuck?
[301:10.68]I thought she was in the cellar too.
[301:19.05]Because this is the kitchen.
[301:19.83]That was weird.
[301:29.85]Don't do that.
[301:34.57]Yeah, servant's quarters.
[301:35.67]I'll just clear everything.
[301:37.50]Might as well.
[301:45.51]Are you still here?
[301:46.07]Max health, curse tolerance.
[301:50.19]Cool.
[301:53.66]I think you need to beat her.
[302:00.61]What the fuck are you doing?
[302:10.90]A wine cellar?
[302:11.79]I really don't remember.
[302:14.67]I thought she was like right here.
[302:27.71]Maybe it is the wine cellar.
[302:35.37]I guess not.
[302:39.12]Did I lose my level up opportunity?
[302:45.07]I think I might have...
[302:46.14]I think I have to find her somewhere else.
[302:47.60]I think I...
[302:47.99]I think she moved.
[302:48.83]Now I have to... Dude, I'm level one.
[302:55.22]I'm level one!
[302:56.24]Well, alright.
[303:06.84]Any organ grease?
[303:18.20]Hold the Bible up.
[303:20.55]Okay.
[303:23.75]flesh ring for all hits when cursedness is above 70%.
[303:30.32]So stay permanently cursed all the way and you get... That's kind of insane.
[303:36.63]God.
[303:45.86]Holy shit!
[303:49.66]There's... Oh, goodness.
[303:51.94]Hold on.
[304:00.98]That was a trap.
[304:01.86]That was a bear trap.
[304:06.77]Okay, you can step on those.
[304:12.55]There's other stuff in here to get, but whatever.
[304:14.41]I need the lantern on.
[304:17.32]Bible's not going to do it right now.
[304:24.32]Okay, we're in the hallway.
[304:25.54]There's somebody coming.
[304:35.67]Does that guy have a shotgun?
[304:42.09]He's going in the other room.
[304:47.81]Hope he's not looking for me.
[304:48.87]Oh, God.
[304:56.54]I think that was him.
[304:58.57]I don't like this at all.
[304:59.68]Oh my God.
[305:01.65]Oh my God.
[305:10.23]Mmm.
[305:17.49]That's supposed to be a safe room!
[305:21.54]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me!
[305:24.68]Give me out, give me out, give me out!
[305:27.22]Ugh...
[305:28.85]Okay.
[305:31.35]I'm glad I was cursed.
[305:40.00]I'm still poisoned.
[305:41.16]Shit.
[305:46.38]Can you... do you sell poison?
[305:48.07]No.
[305:50.77]I don't have any more heals.
[305:52.00]I have to make that anti-poison shit.
[305:54.01]I need a laboratory.
[305:55.06]No, I got one.
[305:55.46]I got one.
[306:06.51]So much more max health when I do that.
[306:12.89]Are these guys spirits?
[306:13.98]We'll find out.
[306:15.09]I'm still using a lead-ass pipe.
[306:30.05]I've devised a most clever contraption to keep father from snooping.
[306:34.08]It requires two people.
[306:35.45]One to turn the crank, and one to grab what's inside.
[306:39.85]So it's absolutely perfect for us.
[306:42.20]I've hidden our cult books there.
[306:44.67]The ones father keeps trying to throw out.
[306:47.06]Who says a girl can't show an interest in machines?
[306:50.34]Father is so insufferable sometimes.
[306:52.33]I think I'll construct a few more of these just to spite him.
[307:12.14]Hello?
[307:17.44]Oh, secret passage.
[307:23.61]Ah.
[307:26.82]I need a co-op partner.
[307:37.57]Upper Parlor.
[307:40.46]Oh, alright.
[307:40.98]I remember this.
[307:41.48]There's this guy.
[307:46.92]Ah, you remind me of my daughter.
[307:49.21]I'm Jeremiah.
[307:51.08]I do maintenance for the asylum, so I know these grounds better than anybody.
[307:55.27]I live in one of the cottages in the valley, but the dream takes me back here each night
[308:00.42]What a funny little slice of hell we found ourselves in.
[308:04.45]Say, I'm sure you could use a few things I found.
[308:06.34]An old mansion like this is just riddled with discarded valuables.
[308:11.32]If you can spare a few coins, I can spare some of the treasure.
[308:18.00]Resistance charm.
[308:27.22]Attached to a chain dating roughly from the 13th century, a potent mix of medicinal incense burns within, faint light and purifying the nearby air.
[308:36.50]Hold L2 to raise, increasing poison recovery and blocking any poison from attack.
[308:41.10]Oh, give me that.
[308:47.45]I want this.
[308:49.03]What's this one do?
[308:52.06]You can go full crazy.
[308:54.58]75% less physical damage.
[308:59.20]I feel like that's not that big of a deal though.
[309:00.82]If you're already that low,
[309:02.05]Okay.
[309:09.07]Am I doing projectile Andy?
[309:13.33]Should I just craft potions to throw at people?
[309:15.58]I think that's what I'm gonna try to do.
[309:20.19]I might do it.
[309:21.88]Magic is cool too, though.
[309:34.33]I have plenty of candles.
[309:40.48]I just spent all my money.
[309:43.95]Oh, you seem familiar.
[309:45.01]Things have been a bit hazy.
[309:46.93]I'm Becca.
[309:47.87]Nice to meet you.
[309:48.76]Or re-meet you.
[309:51.46]Have you seen this dollhouse?
[309:53.99]It may sound a bit childish, but I find it fascinating.
[309:57.32]If you look closely enough, you can see little creatures moving about inside.
[310:01.70]Isn't the dream just grand?
[310:03.41]You can do anything here.
[310:05.84]Training!
[310:08.53]I'm the very first person besides the first witch to be named a fully qualified witch trainer.
[310:13.78]If you need to make an offering, just let me know.
[310:16.60]Oh my god.
[310:17.56]Hold on, I'll be right back.
[310:26.19]No.
[310:30.47]I have a lot of- I'm just gonna sell a bunch of bullshit
[310:40.54]I'm such a hoarder in this game.
[310:43.55]Uh... That's too much shit.
[310:45.90]I...
[310:46.74]It doesn't matter.
[310:48.03]I'll sell...
[310:49.03]a pot piece and the throwing knife and the cleaver and
[310:59.21]I'm actually gonna...
[311:00.87]I'm not gonna use these.
[311:01.84]I really am not.
[311:12.74]Okay, that's enough to do it a few times.
[311:20.81]Okay.
[311:23.85]Health again.
[311:24.43]Okay, uh...
[311:31.63]I think I'm gonna do bleeding and poison tolerance and stuff.
[311:35.49]And yes, you get the other stats like speed, melee damage, you know, strength, dex, intelligence.
[311:42.10]Those come in a little bit here.
[311:46.86]Alright, I need five more coins.
[312:05.51]I have so much of those.
[312:06.37]Again.
[312:17.71]12 more coins, I can do it.
[312:27.87]I can sell this cool picture.
[312:35.49]No, the other guy buys it for way more.
[312:47.63]I don't want to get rid of anything.
[312:50.94]You know what?
[312:51.30]I can get rid of this.
[312:52.79]I don't care about that.
[312:53.77]Anything melee, I don't really care.
[312:55.26]5% chance of double damage?
[312:58.83]Nah.
[313:03.81]Alright, that's almost there.
[313:08.62]Okay.
[313:18.95]Alright, level five.
[313:20.42]Well done!
[313:21.92]You've proven yourself worthy of possessing an Advanced Grimoire.
[313:26.59]Use this at an occult wax table to mix your waxes together for at least more spells.
[313:31.67]Level 10, you'll get an initiate's outfit.
[313:35.43]I can't do it.
[313:35.95]I need more money.
[313:43.10]Sell everything I own.
[313:45.17]Sell the coffee.
[313:47.19]Sell the... this weird skull.
[313:50.37]I kind of like the weird skull.
[313:53.90]about, um,
[313:58.96]No, that's not worth it.
[314:01.35]I'm not using the dolls.
[314:03.30]I'm really not using them.
[314:08.71]How many, how many coins?
[314:12.75]Okay, let's go.
[314:14.08]Here we go.
[314:14.60]Okay, now, this is where it's important.
[314:20.11]More damage is required to interrupt one's actions also greatly enhances the effectiveness of shield.
[314:25.40]This is kind of tank.
[314:28.98]speed of all actions including attacking and dodging,
[314:33.49]Uh, increase the likelihood of finding additional treasure while bolstering one's ability to survive poisoning.
[314:39.25]It's like luck.
[314:43.07]Hmm.
[314:50.73]Did Jerma bulldoze through all the content before leveling, even past the hedge maze?
[314:56.79]Yeah, I was level one for all that.
[314:58.07]I got lucky.
[314:59.39]I did bring the camera though.
[315:01.14]I had prior knowledge of the camera needing to be there.
[315:09.80]I don't know.
[315:14.16]I feel like speed is just important.
[315:18.51]I'm gonna do speed.
[315:19.86]Do agility.
[315:21.82]I can keep going.
[315:24.90]Level up.
[315:25.40]I just need more money.
[315:29.73]I need 18 coins.
[315:36.30]Okay, I'm coming back.
[315:38.87]I'm glad I didn't die so I could hold on to all these things.
[315:42.79]Agility again.
[315:46.59]Fuck, I need more money.
[315:47.74]Hold on.
[316:00.73]These are way too valuable.
[316:03.02]Do you want my kaleidoscope, whatever the hell this is?
[316:07.34]I need that.
[316:15.29]I don't care about this.
[316:17.60]Fire?
[316:17.88]I feel like I'm gonna need that eventually.
[316:19.13]I forget anything is weird.
[316:21.76]You're too greedy here?
[316:22.73]I mean, if I die, I lose all this anyways.
[316:33.37]How many coins did I need?
[316:34.31]20?
[316:34.41]21.
[316:39.49]Just go kill a couple dudes?
[316:41.36]I could, but...
[316:48.15]I'm doing another agility.
[316:52.64]Oh my god, that was dumb.
[316:55.10]Okay, now it's gotten a little more awkward.
[316:58.11]Okay, I don't have a liver.
[317:09.63]I got plenty of cheese.
[317:15.22]Oh, hello.
[317:19.05]Wait a minute.
[317:20.54]Oh, I need money.
[317:21.20]Alright.
[317:21.44]I'm going to go.
[317:22.19]I'll be back.
[317:22.57]I need money.
[317:27.33]Holy shit.
[317:28.81]It's fucking Father Gascoigne.
[317:34.07]Safe room twig.
[317:36.44]Snap to turn the current room into a safe room.
[317:39.30]Ah, that's good.
[317:48.93]What the hell was that?
[318:00.54]I just got comboed.
[318:03.53]Why is the painting coming alive?
[318:11.48]Excuse me.
[318:16.37]Let's pick up everything.
[318:19.93]Pumpkin head.
[318:22.40]foul-smelling pumpkin with the bottom removed so it can be worn as a helmet.
[318:29.28]Okay.
[318:30.37]Less poison buildup and less physical damage.
[318:34.14]Should I put it on?
[318:37.73]Oh, look, I have the pumpkin head on.
[318:44.23]OK, I'm running all over the place here.
[318:46.48]I need to get a strategy.
[318:47.32]I don't know what I'm doing here.
[318:50.90]Priscilla's dream histories.
[318:54.09]From evidence found in the Byzantine labyrinth beneath Mostyn House, we can conclude that the idol was either created or discovered in pre-history.
[319:03.03]The shaman of some nameless ancient tribe would gaze into the idol's eyes each new moon and be taken into the dream.
[319:10.90]What he saw there was likely quite a crude rendering of reality, as the idol had witnessed little at that point.
[319:18.02]As was tradition for ancient man,
[319:20.09]blood sacrifices of animals, while more rarely humans, would be given to the idol.
[319:25.27]You're taking too long.
[319:30.39]Taking too long to what?
[319:38.98]I'm going just fast enough, alright, man?
[319:44.29]Oh, right.
[319:45.01]Okay, hold on.
[319:45.86]I can probably clear this.
[319:48.39]I'm dead.
[319:49.74]I'm dead.
[319:50.46]Good.
[319:57.27]Oh my goodness.
[319:59.90]There are a hundred people in here.
[320:02.61]There's two hundred people in here.
[320:10.75]Oh, I just wanted to go trick or treating.
[320:13.08]This is a fucking big mistake.
[320:15.31]Why did I want to go?
[320:17.30]Yeah.
[320:23.26]Hit him with a down!
[320:33.60]Okay, well, that room is going to have to stay like that for now.
[320:37.89]No, I'm not going in there.
[320:46.96]God.
[320:47.41]He's gonna shoot the gun.
[320:51.20]Oh!
[321:00.94]I have to kill these guys.
[321:02.12]Oh my god, it scared the fuck out of me.
[321:08.51]I knew he was coming too.
[321:15.21]Uh-oh.
[321:17.32]Uh-oh.
[321:20.74]Shoot him!
[321:21.30]Shoot him!
[321:26.65]Hey!
[321:46.99]Get out of here.
[321:52.00]Uh, let that go.
[321:52.66]Hunter ghoul.
[321:59.05]I need a lot of money.
[322:04.32]I gotta redo this quick menu.
[322:05.79]It's kind of all over the place right now.
[322:15.59]Okay.
[322:18.13]Let me look at the big map.
[322:22.38]Alright, attic room A. I could go left from the observatory.
[322:30.68]That's kind of everything here.
[322:32.22]Wait.
[322:33.03]East.
[322:33.21]I'm going to go.
[322:33.61]Let me go that way.
[322:37.98]This is a silly little game.
[322:40.45]It's a great game.
[322:42.74]We are not going that way.
[322:43.81]Never mind.
[322:44.53]That's a huge mistake.
[322:47.93]Fuck it.
[323:01.54]Nice.
[323:05.38]Oh shit, am I out of heals?
[323:06.30]No.
[323:14.20]Upper East...
[323:14.84]Okay, so now...
[323:20.27]This connects to here.
[323:21.81]Shit.
[323:23.73]Okay, upper bathroom.
[323:30.07]I need to- it's one of the rooms here.
[323:38.92]You look like the Headless Horseman I know
[323:49.97]There's no door here.
[323:52.45]Okay, that's weird.
[323:55.54]Priscilla's Dream Histories Part Two.
[324:00.22]The idol turned up in Byzantium around 200 BC.
[324:03.89]The dream steadily grew richer and more realistic as the idol was exposed to the sights, sounds, and smells of the ancient city.
[324:10.21]At some point, its owner realized the tremendous money that could be made by turning it into a playground for the nobility.
[324:16.20]free of any mortal obligations that might exist in the real world, anyone who paid the fee could act freely in the dream.
[324:23.52]At night, the idol would be uncovered and shown arenas, pleasure houses, prisons.
[324:29.29]Knowing not how they connected,
[324:31.08]The idol constructed a labyrinth out of them in the dream.
[324:42.76]Philosophae Somnium.
[324:45.81]The idol constructs a new iteration of the dream each new moon, around every 29 days.
[324:52.24]This is most likely a continuation of some ancient lunar ritual undertaken by its first owners.
[324:57.66]This iteration is further subdivided into periods of unknown length, which we will refer to as days, even though it is always night in the dream.
[325:07.55]After each period, the dream attempts to reset to the same state as when the iteration began.
[325:13.32]It has proven impossible to observe this resetting process as the observer suddenly awakes in bed with only a vague recollection of what happened in the previous day.
[325:24.02]new people, places, and objects beheld by the idol's eyes in the real world during the current iteration are incorporated into the next iteration.
[325:33.92]Somebody said, I'm too dumb for this.
[325:35.55]No, I assure you, you're not because there's more.
[325:39.12]There's more.
[325:40.30]Pretty much what you need to understand is this idol, whatever it sees, whatever you point it at, whatever it looks at,
[325:47.19]It incorporates it into a dream.
[325:50.30]So let's say that you uncovered its eyes and pointed it at the bathroom.
[325:54.75]And that's all you ever showed it.
[325:56.84]The dream would be a bathroom.
[326:00.21]It would be a dream bathroom that you could hang around.
[326:02.40]That would be it.
[326:04.40]It's just whatever it sees, it incorporates into its little dream.
[326:12.55]So if I show it me, if I'm standing in front of it and we show it to me, I can then, I'm now in the dream.
[326:19.66]We get it.
[326:20.34]You love bathrooms.
[326:21.79]You just made that.
[326:23.12]You just talked so loud that it shook the fucking wall.
[326:29.07]I don't like that.
[326:30.74]Wait is that her?
[326:31.20]I think that actually might be her.
[326:40.43]Oh, here's his room.
[326:43.64]God damn it, that's a tutorial monster that I lost to like 10 times.
[326:47.74]That, I thought that was real.
[326:55.01]Shit.
[327:06.16]You know what?
[327:07.48]Let's not mess around here.
[327:20.98]Max health.
[327:23.17]And...
[327:25.92]Put on a shield.
[327:26.64]I don't care about this one.
[327:28.67]Alright, now I'm gonna block.
[327:41.95]Aw, dude.
[327:43.30]Are you kidding me?
[327:48.86]You don't understand.
[327:50.84]I could explain, but I can't.
[327:54.00]I gotta redo this menu.
[328:15.20]Don't kill me!
[328:25.48]He's gonna charge, he's gonna charge.
[328:29.05]Did he charge?
[328:38.01]I got it Heavy zombie
[328:43.03]cholera patient.
[328:45.10]Now here's a proper brute.
[328:46.53]She got the idea for the shield from seeing Albert all dressed up in armor.
[329:00.59]Can I do something with that?
[329:01.56]No.
[329:01.64]Oh, there it is.
[329:03.55]Okay, thanks to the blood sacrifices undertaken by the ancient society that first discovered the idol,
[329:08.03]We have a method to preserve objects so that they are not reset at the end of the day in the dream.
[329:13.65]painting over an object's surface with blood or pureed organs
[329:18.73]will cause it to remain in its same state day after day in a particular iteration.
[329:24.30]These techniques can be developed in many directions, such as weaving clothing with a bit of blood on the silk or using organ paste as mortar between bricks.
[329:34.29]For those lucky few who are able to successfully cast magical spells in the dream,
[329:39.76]Organ grease can be applied to the body in a ritualistic fashion to permanently increase one's strength.
[329:45.75]For an even more powerful effect, organ grease can be vaporized and the gas inhaled.
[329:54.83]crazy alright there's a secret in here right we gotta we gotta get his what are we gonna do oh yeah we have to do this
[330:03.76]I can't turn it though.
[330:05.12]Can it stay?
[330:05.73]Okay, well that's the secret.
[330:10.39]What did the quest say?
[330:17.19]Explore Robert Blackett's room to find a key.
[330:24.41]Did I already get it?
[330:25.74]I just didn't see it.
[330:33.05]I mean, it's definitely behind that.
[330:48.44]Ooh.
[330:49.24]Heals one point of curse every two seconds unless curse rotted.
[330:55.25]Uh, that thing's incredible.
[330:59.88]Why would I not put that on?
[331:11.34]Cool.
[331:12.72]How about my rings?
[331:13.59]Dog shit.
[331:20.00]Yeah, take this off.
[331:21.40]Who cares about speed?
[331:22.14]Max health.
[331:24.63]That's good too.
[331:27.00]Max health, max health.
[331:30.24]Cursed Tolerance.
[331:32.53]I'm not casting that many spells, so I don't really care about this.
[331:35.06]I'll do the more, even more health.
[331:41.39]Look at that health bar now.
[331:43.62]That is a gigantic health bar.
[331:48.71]I'll fix my bars later.
[331:55.08]Oh my God!
[331:56.77]Who the fuck are you?
[331:57.96]What the fuck was that?
[332:02.25]I've never seen that before.
[332:03.38]I've played this game.
[332:04.26]I've played through this game before.
[332:05.36]I don't know what that was.
[332:07.77]Bones that have been turned to ash by incredible heat.
[332:11.89]What the fuck was that?
[332:21.15]I don't think I've ever even seen that before.
[332:26.35]Okay, well, I apparently learned a new spell.
[332:29.99]Oh god, who's that?
[332:33.22]What is that?
[332:37.03]Alright, she's in here.
[332:39.34]I'm not doing that yet.
[332:46.43]Upper bedroom, no.
[332:50.25]Hey, should I... Ding dong.
[332:58.80]Okay, this is a... That seems like something I can't kill.
[333:06.28]Look at that Gigachad walk.
[333:07.82]There's no way.
[333:16.84]Hold on.
[333:18.01]Look at me.
[333:19.92]Look at the difference.
[333:21.33]That ain't happening.
[333:27.64]fuck oh fuck um
[333:37.07]You broke my shit.
[333:44.18]That uppercut.

[333:58.25]Nice.
[333:58.86]He missed.
[334:04.39]That uppercut sucks.
[334:09.44]A bullet.
[334:10.64]Yes, there are guns in this game.
[334:13.26]There are multiple guns.
[334:20.56]Oh my fucking god.
[334:33.03]Um, hold on a second.
[334:34.82]Hold on a second.
[334:37.97]Somebody just fucking jumped off the ceiling.
[334:40.50]Who just jumped off the roof?
[334:43.63]Why are they all here?
[334:44.69]Oh no.
[334:47.08]Oh no.
[334:48.89]Um... What the fuck is back there?
[334:54.61]Okay, kill this stupid book.
[335:01.42]Oh!
[335:02.57]I'm rotting.
[335:03.19]I'm rotting.
[335:05.60]Rotting.
[335:07.88]Help.
[335:08.73]No!
[335:10.75]Are we good?
[335:11.35]Are we cool?
[335:12.13]Are you an NPC?
[335:13.66]I think we're cool.
[335:15.23]Are you good?
[335:18.20]Thank you for giving me enough time to eat.
[335:20.06]Thanks for giving me time to eat again.
[335:23.84]I appreciate the time for you to... Am I bleeding?
[335:28.21]No?
[335:30.02]I appreciate you letting me put this shield on.
[335:42.57]You piece of shit.
[335:49.96]Okay.
[335:53.29]Anybody hiding in here?
[335:55.62]Honestly, what the fuck just happened?
[335:58.51]I feel like I was in a GTA Online lobby for five seconds.
[336:03.38]Who was that weird ghoul that fell into the front of the camera?
[336:10.15]Oh god.
[336:19.88]I can't block...
[336:20.97]Yes.
[336:23.84]Hold on, hold on.
[336:24.46]I'm gonna do the dummy.
[336:31.68]It's like those slow-mo videos of somebody, right when somebody gets punched in the face, when they do like the slap somebody in the mouth.
[336:38.18]Hard.
[336:39.67]Okay, wait.
[336:42.90]I got my Phoenix Familiar.
[336:47.35]That might be good right here.
[336:48.72]Come help me.
[336:49.82]Alright, I got a book two.
[336:55.25]And... Alright, let's start throwing shit.
[337:06.52]You are a snake.
[337:15.47]Shit, I'm being throw jar, Andy.
[337:18.44]No way I'm not.
[337:23.72]Are you kidding me?
[337:24.31]This thing does like 40% of their health pool in one jar.
[337:33.41]You throw like a girl.
[337:36.84]Yeah?
[337:39.47]You think so?
[337:45.61]We don't know what this distance is.
[337:47.02]This could be 10 to 20 meters.
[337:53.54]You know how heavy this could be?
[337:54.99]This could be full.
[337:55.90]This could be like eight pounds.
[337:57.53]Maybe like a 10 pound jar.
[338:04.86]Alright.
[338:05.51]Am I okay to go out here?
[338:06.54]Or is this going to be chaos again?
[338:12.42]I think I'm alright.
[338:14.81]Let me heal.
[338:15.54]Alright.
[338:16.68]I got three of these.
[338:17.45]I got four of those.
[338:19.98]I'm gonna get these on the...
[338:22.23]Okay, I got three pieces of cheese.
[338:23.88]Two scones.
[338:27.30]Is that enough to beat the witch, do you think?
[338:29.25]I'm gonna get rolled.
[338:31.79]I'm gonna get my ass just fucking handed to me right now.
[338:36.41]Okay, well, she's apparently in here.
[338:43.39]Eat shit?
[338:51.23]Get her with acid!
[338:56.62]That wasn't even her.
[339:00.16]She's got a big ass bed!
[339:14.37]Thin metal wire treated with a mixture of blood and organs in the right hands can be weaved into fabric.
[339:20.24]You can upgrade armor.
[339:21.29]That is the way to do it, if I remember.
[339:24.10]It's been a while.
[339:24.80]It's been a couple of years.
[339:31.78]Ooh.
[339:35.66]Enchant spell?
[339:36.86]Up to three suits of armor or dolls can be enchanted to do battle for the caster.
[339:41.10]I will tell you, last time I played this game, this is the build that I did.
[339:47.13]I did do this, and it was really cool.
[339:52.20]Curseball and then Harvest Field.
[339:57.03]I'll show it to you, let's go.
[340:04.69]curse ball I'll try it that was really good too alright
[340:13.50]Thank you.
[340:25.55]You are such a piece of shit.

[340:43.81]Dude, what's- I got my- the seed that I got, I just have a lead pipe.
[340:49.80]I need a better weapon.
[341:00.72]Okay, what do you have?
[341:03.18]Possessed chest, it's a mimic.
[341:08.70]It's a decent amount of money.
[341:15.47]I'm almost out of health too.
[341:20.11]I only got like five more of these.
[341:21.33]Okay.
[341:27.03]To the first witch.
[341:30.38]Samantha, I waited for assistance in my room for nearly a full hour tonight.
[341:34.96]If you don't show up tomorrow, I'll simply enchant the doll to assist me
[341:38.55]and you will be dismissed from your duties.
[341:41.21]Don't disappoint me again, Robert."
[341:43.61]Alright, so we enchant the doll.
[341:46.81]That's absolutely what we do, because remember the doll was sitting there.
[341:49.64]Actually, we might be able to do it to this.
[341:50.97]Will you do this?
[341:53.50]I'm curious.
[341:56.10]Because that doll was just kind of sitting there and I think that's what you do.
[341:59.92]Let me try this.
[342:04.74]Will you actually lift this up for me?
[342:09.18]Come on, my creature.
[342:12.16]Don't run away, please.
[342:13.83]This way.
[342:14.73]Follow me.
[342:16.62]Alright, I need you to open that.
[342:19.13]Turn this.
[342:22.12]Turn this thing, please.
[342:24.43]Get- get it!
[342:27.12]Open the- turn it!
[342:30.85]I need you to turn this.
[342:34.37]Get the item for me.
[342:37.06]God damn it.
[342:37.72]He's stupid.
[342:38.68]Okay.
[342:39.25]Well... Well, at least help me.
[342:43.34]Protect me.
[342:50.18]Alright, get in there and fight.
[342:54.55]What did you do?
[342:55.17]Oh.
[342:56.56]Okay, good.
[343:00.55]Oops.
[343:02.77]God damn it.
[343:10.11]Alright, will you help?
[343:16.57]Fighter!
[343:21.94]Dude, you...
[343:26.00]I'm so confused.
[343:28.10]I can't tell if he's doing that...
[343:35.71]Nice.
[343:36.11]I don't have very...
[343:38.11]I think you have the most spell power you...
[343:41.22]I don't know who's doing that.
[343:42.31]It's freaking me out though.
[343:47.19]Nice work.
[343:49.35]Alright.
[343:50.30]Let me just loot this place.
[343:53.92]Who needs operators, you know what I mean?
[343:56.70]Look at me looting.
[344:10.24]OK, do you think he can handle this?
[344:15.30]This thing is going to kill us in my one hit, but I'm going to have you go in there.
[344:21.61]Fight it!
[344:28.42]What happened?
[344:30.01]Get out!
[344:30.23]Get away, away, away!
[344:36.02]no we're not doing that right now why is there clothes been following you
[344:46.49]Look at this inventory.
[344:47.59]This is so screwed up.
[344:50.46]I haven't...
[344:50.90]I don't have any more health.
[344:52.47]I have... Well, yeah, I do.
[344:56.71]I think I can do it.
[344:57.96]Let me just get some... Let me just ready up.
[345:02.47]Okay.
[345:03.95]I'm gonna do doll and then throw poison at people.
[345:08.41]Here we go.
[345:08.77]Ready?
[345:12.07]I'm gonna wait till he crosses.
[345:23.07]Okay, now let's get out the projectile poison.
[345:33.72]Well, I'm just hurting my own
[345:40.50]Oh my god, we're just fucking double team killing.
[345:43.42]Whatever.
[345:50.51]Is he poisoned?
[345:58.64]He can't be parallel- I think he probably has high parallel assisted resistances.
[346:04.66]Holy shit.
[346:06.49]Look at that!
[346:09.39]Do I have anything else I can throw at you?
[346:21.51]Fight that one.
[346:27.25]Ow.
[346:28.20]Wait, I have another dummy.
[346:32.06]Dude, there's so many versions of me just laying on the ground dead.
[346:43.65]Uh-oh.
[346:44.88]No, fight the doll!
[346:45.84]Fight the doll!
[346:47.81]Whatever, I'm running.
[347:03.61]I'll just eat a piece of cheese.
[347:04.52]I don't care.
[347:08.17]Nice.
[347:13.42]Elite armor.
[347:15.59]Okay, low fire resist.
[347:22.27]Cool.
[347:23.78]describes a method of running faster by harnessing the trace amounts of cursed energy that permeate the environment.
[347:29.23]Cursed toll is exacted during the run.
[347:35.17]How does that work?
[347:39.36]How do I activate that?
[347:46.24]There's still shit in here.
[347:49.24]Nice.
[347:49.82]Yeah, turn it on.
[348:00.25]Okay, I kind of want... Where's the projectile?
[348:02.38]Anything projectile?
[348:05.46]I'm all for it.
[348:08.06]And I'm probably gonna stop streaming.
[348:10.85]I'm probably gonna call it here in the next like 10-15.
[348:19.62]It's been about five and a half, six hours.
[348:21.85]If you talk about before the computer crash, it's been like five and a half or six.
[348:30.52]But I will be playing this again.
[348:32.17]Maybe even tomorrow.
[348:37.39]It's very possible.
[348:39.48]If not tomorrow, then I will pick it back up in a couple days.
[348:48.64]This thing is kind of insane.
[348:49.77]Yeah, I need to keep that.
[348:56.57]Fashion record?
[349:01.67]It really is effectively just loadouts.
[349:06.46]When the dream resets at the end of a day, every inhabitant awakens where the dream believes they were in the real world.
[349:13.16]In most cases, this isn't a bed.
[349:16.27]This process can be circumvented in a few ways.
[349:18.86]Going to sleep in a structure, such as a coffin, that has been coated in blood is one way.
[349:24.97]Magic rituals exist which can re-bind someone to a different bed.
[349:29.55]Finally, it is possible to fully erase an inhabitant of the dream by mixing organ grease with the ashes of their charred body.
[349:36.81]They do not return.
[349:42.83]Yeah.
[349:44.88]Yeah.
[349:47.42]Yeah.
[349:49.21]Okay.
[349:49.79]Got another axe.
[349:51.90]That's everything in here.
[349:53.85]I'm going back to the first witch's bedroom.
[349:55.76]See if I can go...
[349:57.06]I'm cursed, right?
[349:57.97]I think I should just maybe keep it like this for a little... That's so weird.
[350:05.16]Okay.
[350:06.25]No, we're not actually going to stay like this.
[350:15.85]SEGA CD type sound.
[350:17.24]I love the soundtrack.
[350:18.01]I think it's wonderful.
[350:20.78]Get drunk and play Minecraft on the PS4 again.
[350:26.91]Yeah?
[350:29.05]You'd like that, wouldn't you?
[350:36.25]So what happened in here?
[350:37.43]Why did this shit went so wrong in here?
[350:43.80]right okay I gotta get the doll to alright I have to get the doll to do that but
[350:52.66]I kinda need to, yeah.
[350:55.23]This'll be a next stream thing.
[351:04.32]I will collect all the shit that's here though.
[351:12.01]Weird, I don't know how to get in there.
[351:18.17]I didn't get everything in here?
[351:21.19]I might have to be cursed to get the other items in here.
[351:24.37]That's usually what it means.
[351:29.01]Okay.
[351:35.59]That's it.
[351:39.32]I will see you guys in the next few days.
[351:41.41]We will continue.
[351:42.82]We're kind of like just about halfway through chapter two.
[351:48.61]But it's one of my favorite games.
[351:50.81]I love it.
[351:52.40]We will continue it at some point in the near future.
[352:01.42]we'll pick it up exactly where we left it off.
[352:09.29]Have a great rest of your day or night.
[352:14.91]Yeah, it's funny.
[352:15.68]I really do love this game, but I really have only played it once.
[352:19.72]And I said I wanted enough time to go by where I could
[352:24.71]Wow, I forgot about that.
[352:27.08]I forgot about that.
[352:28.37]It's great when you don't play something or do something for a couple of years, you really can just go back to it.
[352:34.89]But I've gone through this one time.
[352:37.38]This is the second time I've ever played this.
[352:39.86]Well, you know what I mean.
[352:47.73]Alright.
[352:48.05]Have a good one.
[352:49.12]See you next time.
[352:49.74]Goodbye.
[352:50.93]Good night.
[352:52.56]See you soon.
