[00:04.81]Hello, everyone.
[00:05.45]Hi.
[00:08.13]Can you hear me?
[00:10.49]That's good.
[00:11.07]I'm coming through the headset.
[00:12.95]Here I am.
[00:13.61]Hi.
[00:16.29]Who?
[00:17.65]Me.
[00:20.07]Good afternoon, everybody.
[00:25.62]I'm back at my normal setup.
[00:28.28]Weird stuff at the end of the last stream, but it's okay.
[00:37.36]uh we're not going to talk too much about like the kind of haunted that I was dealing with it was kind of weird but ah maybe one day we'll talk about it but it was a little odd for me he's the imposter oh we took care of that guy we took care of the real imposter and it's me and it always has been I haven't gone anywhere
[01:04.82]But yeah, we're going to do VR virtual reality one more time.
[01:08.15]Because it's still set up and I don't really want to tear the whole thing down before I play a few more of these games.
[01:19.77]You don't have a pop filter on?
[01:20.99]This is the Valve VR headset.
[01:25.47]I'm sorry I don't have a pop filter on today.
[01:31.30]No pop filter?
[01:37.46]Oh, speaking of audio, I want to talk about this too really quickly.
[01:40.26]I'm going to bring this up like three times throughout the stream because I feel like it's important.
[01:45.74]So during the... During the replacement stream, the audio got all fucked up a bunch of times, right?
[01:54.12]That was because we had some connection problems to Twitch.
[01:59.20]And it was like feedbacking back to the stream.
[02:02.30]It was a weird connection problem.
[02:04.54]But...
[02:05.73]Huge, huge, awesome news here.
[02:08.97]We have the studio recording that is currently on the Archive channel.
[02:16.10]So 90% of those shitty audio problems that you heard randomly through the stream, almost all of them are gone.
[02:22.18]So we got the actual studio recording if you want to watch some of those scenes that you may have been kind of unintelligible.
[02:28.81]They are available because that VOD on the Archive channel
[02:33.34]clean audio for the most part there's still some problems but it's okay stream saved the director's cut yeah I'm not gonna it's no pop filter stop it so I'm really happy about that because uh I don't know people were talking about they were getting like weird Twitch errors on that stream too
[03:01.25]and the connection problems we had throughout that stream.
[03:04.61]I'm glad that like 90% of that stream was fine, but it's pretty much fixed on the VOD, so that's good.
[03:14.24]What about the POG filter?
[03:15.78]Oh, there's a shitload of new emotes I put on from BTTV.
[03:20.46]Yeah, I sound weird because I'm holding this headset upside down.
[03:25.96]I sound, it's like you're inside of my mouth right now.
[03:28.90]It's weird.
[03:32.79]Alright, anyways.
[03:34.55]We are going to get started.
[03:35.39]The first game on tap for the day.
[03:38.53]A game called Detective... Crowhill Detective Case Files.
[03:47.02]And there's audio popping in my ear.
[03:50.48]Alright, let me get on here.
[03:57.35]Not Frog Detective.
[03:58.43]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:58.93]Just a second.
[04:06.58]This is probably going to be really loud.
[04:07.86]Please tell me if it is.
[04:08.60]Hey, what's happening?
[04:20.10]You are Andy.
[04:20.88]I know it's going to this weird pops.
[04:22.89]I can hear them.
[04:23.53]That's not me.
[04:24.11]That's the game.
[04:24.57]Alright.
[04:26.09]This is VR detective case files.
[04:30.23]Let's get in here.
[04:32.48]Are you ready?
[04:32.90]Are you guys ready for the last VR stream in like at least six months?
[04:37.28]Because the whole thing goes into the package that it came in.
[04:40.36]And I literally put the package into a closet and don't touch it.
[04:43.95]And there's literally dust on it when I take it out.
[04:46.13]Alright.
[04:51.01]I'm in.
[04:52.87]Kind of.
[04:54.09]I'm getting like rumbles.
[04:57.02]Alright.
[04:57.22]My pants are on.
[04:57.92]Can I see you guys?
[04:59.06]I can.
[04:59.40]There you are.
[05:01.72]That sounds like VR.
[05:02.90]Alright, let's go.
[05:04.32]Oh, an anonymous skifter can skip five community subs!
[05:10.16]Fake Jerma.
[05:10.81]We went over this.
[05:12.49]I dealt with a little bit of weird shit in the hotel room.
[05:14.37]That's fine.
[05:15.03]I took care of it.
[05:19.45]You know what I tell you?
[05:20.13]My favorite part about that last stream was, even though I was being haunted, God, my favorite part of that stream is, remember when I was yelling Aaron?
[05:27.56]Oh, that was my favorite part.
[05:28.84]That was my absolute favorite part of that entire broadcast.
[05:32.95]I cannot tell you how much fun it was for me to say Aaron.
[05:36.57]Loudly.
[05:38.62]Oh my god, I loved it.
[05:39.56]Alright, let's go.
[05:41.08]New game.

[05:48.68]Alright, use left thumbstick and right thumbstick.
[05:54.59]Wait, hold on a minute.
[05:55.35]This is going to come on a little tighter.
[06:00.31]You know you're not doing VR right until it hurts.
[06:04.93]You know what I mean?
[06:08.37]And like, when are we going to get over that part?
[06:10.13]Right?
[06:11.31]Oh, it's kind of hard.
[06:12.05]I can't really see that much.
[06:13.87]Hey, what do I do?
[06:14.55]A guy that knows VR really well, what do I do?
[06:17.45]Oh, well, what you have to do is you have to tighten it until it hurts.
[06:20.40]Oh, okay.
[06:21.38]Yeah, that hurts.
[06:22.30]Good.
[06:22.74]Now you can see.

[16:26.32]Eh, that's weird.
[16:27.62]Alright, let me get back into this.
[16:29.40]That was like one of the most ridiculous five minutes I think ever.
[16:31.89]I don't even know what was going on.
[16:34.71]Oh my god, it's so dark in here.
[16:41.14]It's like it was dark in here.
[16:44.06]Alright.

[16:53.87]Yes, yes, I just tried to pick the gun up with my real hand.
[16:56.50]Yes, I did.
[17:01.80]Did I turn the lights off in this game somehow?
[17:05.82]What just happened?
[17:10.48]I just turned the lights on over there and the lights turned off here.
[17:18.54]That was pretty weird.
[17:19.44]Alright, let's go.
[17:25.19]Alright, I'm not going to fuck this up now.
[17:29.07]Let's do it.
[17:31.07]Wait, we're going to go in the car again, aren't we?
[17:32.45]Alright, car time.

[17:43.24]Can I go faster at least?
[17:47.64]Wait.
[17:49.97]I am driving the car.
[17:53.37]Is that the moon?
[18:01.90]What game is this?
[18:02.54]It's called Crowville.
[18:05.38]Is there a save?
[18:05.78]Why are you guys saying audio?
[18:12.26]You have your parking brake on.
[18:13.61]Oh, I- what do I hit?
[18:22.95]I- AH!
[18:24.69]The game is too quiet?
[18:25.71]Should I turn the game up, actually?
[18:32.24]Is it too loud?
[18:32.84]You guys are just fucking with me.
[18:37.26]I feel like Fred Flintstone.
[18:38.74]Like, I'm walking right now.
[18:40.12]I'm running with the car.
[18:46.87]Check your blinker.
[18:49.76]No, it's fine.
[18:50.50]Alright, alright.
[18:53.34]Alright.
[18:55.78]Alright, so now let me figure out what the hell I'm supposed to do here.
[18:58.48]I gotta get the key, but there's like a weird... Alright, alright, alright!
[19:01.46]Here come the animals!
[19:02.16]Here come the animals!
[19:03.28]Here come the animals!
[19:07.30]Where's my... Where'd it go?
[19:15.51]Where'd the clip go?
[19:19.70]Where's the clip?
[19:20.24]I just had it.
[19:23.36]What happened to the clip?
[19:33.75]Under here, probably?
[19:35.92]What the fuck just happened?
[19:38.44]What happened to the clip?
[19:39.60]Is it gone?
[19:40.80]Wait.
[19:44.08]Oh my fucking god.
[19:45.52]I don't even know where the clip is.
[19:49.26]Under the bench?
[19:50.05]I just looked under the bench!
[19:58.43]It's not here!
[20:06.08]I have to do it without it.
[20:09.28]It's under there.
[20:10.30]Just run.
[20:10.78]How do I run?
[20:12.34]Is there a run?
[20:21.19]Wait, you saw it?
[20:25.30]How do I run?
[20:26.06]I have to be able to run, right?
[20:36.01]Next game, please.
[20:36.85]No, just wait!
[20:39.77]Push in the sticks?
[20:42.13]Alright, I'm just gonna go by and see what happens.
[20:48.13]Go, go, go, go!
[20:50.49]Where's the key?
[20:52.03]Where's the key?
[20:56.63]He can't hit me if I'm inside of his body.
[20:58.09]Yeah, he can.
[21:03.52]I trapped him, I trapped him!
[21:07.48]How the fuck do you run?
[21:09.74]Alright, we're gonna move on.
[21:10.64]I'm not doing that again.
[21:12.12]I'm not doing it again.
[21:13.56]That game has potential though.
[21:15.26]That
[21:20.76]There's so much potential.
[21:22.06]I love this game.
[21:27.03]What should I do?
[21:27.51]Sweet!
[21:29.17]Last attempt, I swear to God.
[21:31.41]Somebody's made a good point.
[21:34.51]I'm gonna do seated VR and use the teleport.
[21:37.95]I promise this is the last time I'm gonna try this.
[21:39.59]I think this game has potential.
[21:40.63]I'm not going anywhere.
[21:42.26]Just give me a minute.
[21:46.52]Seated.
[21:46.76]Wait Wait, what?
[21:50.15]Hold on, wait, what?
[21:50.85]It was already unseated.
[21:58.31]Alright, maybe that was what the problem was.
[22:05.39]Left thumbstick and right thumbstick.
[22:11.75]I don't think that's how this works.
[22:12.86]Alright, last try.
[22:13.68]I'm going to make sure I have the gun and I'm going to run and shoot the guy and kill him.
[22:16.09]Go.
[22:16.15]Alright, no distractions.
[22:17.11]Go, go, go.
[22:17.49]Oh, no.
[22:17.65]Not about the guy with the axe, right?
[22:19.13]We don't care about that guy.
[22:20.61]I promise this is the last time you're going to see me do this.
[22:23.17]Dude.
[22:43.51]Go.

[41:43.81]Okay, so this is the first time I've ever sat just sitting here in VR.
[41:47.19]I've never done seated VR before, really.
[41:50.25]Um, I could never do this.
[41:51.85]I know this man isn't as luxurious as your old office, but we can't let Xoraxis know you survived your last mission.
[41:56.89]Xoraxis?
[41:57.63]You've got a knack for putting a wrench in Dr. Xor's plans, so Xoraxis employees remain agreeable kindly if they recognize you.
[42:04.68]On the bright side, now you've got a mini-fridge.
[42:06.90]What?
[42:07.24]As usual, Xoraxis Corporation is up to something vile and nefarious, but we haven't been able to figure out what.
[42:14.64]The prime minister is certainly making himself a target.
[42:18.08]Keep an ear to the radio agent.
[42:19.92]You never know what they might let slip.
[42:21.86]Game sucks ass.
[42:23.19]Your briefing materials should be arriving any second.

[42:42.92]Protect the Prime Minister.
[42:44.68]Alright, cool.
[42:45.12]Report available upon completion.
[42:46.06]Let's go for it.
[43:05.74]Excuse me.
[43:06.96]Let's get you undercover so we can figure out what Xoraxis is up to.
[43:10.02]How do I let go of this machine?
[43:13.66]Get my hand off this.
[43:17.88]Four days ago.
[43:18.50]Okay.

[43:26.12]I can't play this game.
[43:27.30]What do I do?
[43:29.64]My instincts were right.
[43:31.48]This place is crawling with Xoraxis operatives.
[43:34.59]Set stage.
[43:35.01]Okay.

[44:02.26]What the hell is happening?
[44:32.74]How far down do I have to do this?
[44:35.60]Banners down.
[44:36.36]All the way?

[45:27.61]No help.
[45:30.33]You're taking L's...
[45:33.03]I understand, but how do I stop being in the grip mode?
[45:40.29]I can't touch anything.
[45:46.50]No help, no help.
[45:48.02]The ratio.
[45:51.10]Like why?
[45:55.91]Let go of whatever you are fucking holding!
[46:00.03]What am I holding with this?
[46:03.48]What?
[46:09.05]I am so confused right now.
[46:10.67]What is going on?
[46:14.91]I need to restart?
[46:21.51]Dude, I can't even hit the restart button.
[46:23.85]What happened?
[46:28.54]Take the headset off.
[46:31.26]Okay, that gave me, that freed up my left hand.
[46:34.76]My right hand is still holding onto something.
[46:45.55]Like, am I holding this still?
[46:47.59]What does the game think I'm holding onto?
[46:50.21]Slow, do a flip.
[46:55.17]Okay, I literally just gripped for a second and now they're stuck.
[47:06.31]I don't know what to do.
[47:06.93]I don't understand what's going on.
[47:08.52]I think I have to restart the game.

[48:31.77]Josh said something.
[48:36.25]Game might be tabbed out on the PC.
[48:39.01]What?
[48:44.33]Can you see?
[48:51.34]Dude, why can't I press the button once and then never again?
[48:54.00]Holy shit, what's with these fucking games not working?
[49:07.47]Are you sitting under the sensor?
[49:09.65]No, it was working for the first, like, 24- 30 minutes.
[49:13.68]Let me try to restart it.
[49:15.90]Stupid.
[49:18.10]Fucking VR.
[49:20.59]I'm gonna dropkick this off the roof of my house when I'm done.
[49:24.27]Like, am I?
[49:25.13]Okay, hold on a second.
[49:27.74]Yeah, okay, so what?
[49:29.56]I don't know.
[49:32.34]I'm just gonna reload it.
[49:42.58]Oh, you know what?
[49:42.98]Fuck it.
[49:43.24]We're playing this other game.
[49:45.36]That just pissed me off more than anything.
[49:49.12]That just pissed me off.
[49:51.57]I'm not playing it anymore.
[50:03.16]Well, now my SteamVR just crashed.
[50:16.54]Okay, wait.
[50:17.58]Is it here?
[50:18.54]Can anybody see it?
[50:20.70]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[50:24.56]Okay.
[50:25.25]We're gonna play Furious Seas.
[50:26.79]I hope it works!
[50:30.67]When are we gonna get out of the tech demo stage of VR?
[50:33.99]I know every VR stream is a rant stream, but holy shit.
[50:36.51]Like, when did the fucking Vive come out?
[50:42.42]Like, 2015 or something? 2016?
[50:46.56]Are we ever going to get out of the fucking demo stage of VR?
[50:48.91]Or is it just going to be permanent demos forever?
[50:51.99]Alright, let's see.
[50:55.15]Does this work?
[51:00.01]Okay, this is called Furious Seas.
[51:04.39]Ooh!
[51:06.44]How do I shoot it?
[51:10.60]Do I have to reload it?
[51:11.60]Oh, this is going to be fun.

[52:03.64]If you're feeling hardy enough to take up sail on a mission, pick it up and pin it on the commission board over here.
[52:09.73]Why does it think I'm way smaller?
[52:12.05]You'll return here for your reward.
[52:14.67]If you're feeling a little yellow, you can always pick a different listing.
[52:21.20]Okay, so let's go with you.

[64:16.91]Oh, shit, bad.
[64:19.13]Oh.
[64:19.63]Fire, fire!
[64:43.03]Turn, that way.
[64:44.27]I think I'm doing okay.
[64:46.59]It's a telescope.
[64:47.83]It might as well not be anything because we can see where they are.
[64:59.54]Get him!
[65:04.00]Oh, that was not... That was so anti-climactic.
[65:07.34]Okay, well, whatever.
[65:13.67]Did I shoot my own boat?
[65:18.41]Am I shooting our boat?
[65:22.65]Nice job.

[65:49.37]Turn.
[65:49.93]Fast.
[65:51.25]How have you guys not loaded any more double shots?
[65:58.98]I don't understand.
[65:59.56]How have you guys not done that?
[66:01.24]I feel like a shitty asshole manager.
[66:07.34]Now, how come you didn't do that?
[66:08.70]Why is it not like that?
[66:10.52]Those should be loaded, ready to go.
[66:17.98]Shit, turn.
[66:18.54]He's gonna shoot us.
[66:19.14]Alright, here we go.
[66:27.00]Line it up.
[66:27.85]Fire up!
[66:35.13]Yeah!
[66:36.17]Nice job.
[66:36.61]Nice job.
[66:48.77]So how do I prove that I killed him?
[66:54.45]Wait, that's him?
[66:56.01]Why is he a dragon?
[66:56.97]Wait, what kind of boat is that?
[67:02.46]That's like an old flying machine from like 1800.
[67:12.39]No way, I need that!
[67:13.29]It's like a receipt!
[67:14.03]I think I need that.
[67:15.17]That's a receipt, right?
[67:16.20]Like, I killed him, so... Do I need that?
[67:25.38]I need health.
[67:27.95]Can we load up some new stuff, please?
[67:34.61]I'm kind of scared of this guy.
[67:40.19]Should I just go straight on?
[67:41.39]He's coming straight on.
[67:55.44]Let this be our final mission.
[68:00.50]Boys, it has been an absolute pleasure to have served with you all these years.
[68:04.13]Boys, it has been...
[68:12.50]Fire!
[68:19.21]Fire!
[68:19.71]Hey, what?
[68:22.33]Oh, we're dead.
[68:26.95]Hurry, turn.
[68:27.55]Turn.
[68:27.65]Can you do another note?
[68:52.58]Wait, throw barrels out!
[68:53.66]Where are the barrels?
[68:56.90]Oh shit, how do I throw barrels out?
[68:58.61]Turn.
[69:03.17]Keep playing, keep playing.
[69:04.47]Mate, keep playing.
[69:08.05]Oh, he's dead.
[69:10.98]That guy died.
[69:11.65]That guy got hit in the head with a cannon and it just took his head clean off.
[69:15.11]Here we go.
[69:26.80]Okay, that sounded like an accordion.
[69:34.59]That didn't even sound like a harmonica.
[69:37.13]He's just going... That's not a harmonica.
[69:44.02]Was it an accordion?
[69:46.80]What was that?
[69:51.86]That's not a harmonica.
[69:52.70]That's an accordion.
[69:55.89]Oh, just block him.
[69:57.85]He's going to crash into the island.
[70:02.35]What are you going to do now, huh?
[70:05.47]Where are you going to go?
[70:13.93]Oh shit!
[70:14.55]Everybody alright?
[70:25.47]We're good!
[70:29.95]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[70:34.03]No way that hits.
[70:36.19]You hit a direct hit.
[70:37.32]You gotta be kidding me dude.
[70:38.36]Alright.
[70:42.43]Damn it.
[70:42.85]Shit.
[70:43.17]Turn.
[70:43.89]Turn it slow.
[70:44.89]Right here.
[70:45.13]This is it.
[70:45.35]Right here.
[70:45.85]Bunch of hits.
[70:46.37]3, 2, 1.
[70:46.67]Good job.
[71:12.52]Oh, I don't like how close they're getting.
[71:13.62]Turn.
[71:13.80]Here they come, here they come.
[71:18.53]Ready?
[71:24.59]Are they talking to us?
[71:31.97]Watch out for that bomb!
[71:32.85]Here we go!
[71:40.92]It's an accordion!
[71:42.34]It's an accordion!
[71:44.02]It's an accordion!
[71:49.24]He was seriously using an accordion.
[71:52.44]Oh my god.
[71:53.24]I feel so validated right now.
[71:57.98]Nobody thought that was an accordion.
[72:00.55]God damn it.
[72:01.29]Why do they have such good shots?
[72:02.63]Come on.
[72:05.35]Holy shit.
[72:10.53]Hit the brake, hit the brake, he won't... I've never flown a ship before, I don't know how to actually do this.
[72:18.83]Bastard.
[72:24.33]Fuck!
[72:29.77]Oh, I got it!
[72:30.81]See how those shanties play at the bottom of the ocean, Tails?
[72:39.62]Got him.
[72:40.44]Hell yeah.
[72:43.15]That was intense.
[72:47.19]That was fun.
[72:48.41]Alright.
[72:51.49]Got no more money.
[72:52.25]Ship's destroyed.
[72:52.91]4400 bucks now.
[72:55.79]What can I do with this?
[73:01.17]Very cool.
[73:03.83]Now what?
[73:05.86]That was the mission I was on.
[73:06.80]Do I have to go get another mission?
[73:10.33]Upgrade the ship?
[73:12.79]This is fucking fun.
[73:20.67]Okay.
[73:21.37]Cannons.
[73:21.85]Yeah.
[73:22.21]Pick up raft for power up.
[73:23.35]Yep.
[73:25.11]Move up and down or zoom in and out.
[73:26.57]Yep.
[73:28.95]Wait.
[73:29.39]No.
[73:29.55]We're still here.
[73:29.99]What is this?
[73:35.23]If I want to collect the bounty on Tails' head, I gotta report back at the mission board.
[73:40.09]I just gotta ring the left bell until I come to a complete stop near the shack.
[73:44.07]Here?
[73:44.31]Then I'll let them know to open up shop.
[73:46.65]Okay.
[73:47.33]So we gotta go left.
[73:50.73]We gotta go back that way.
[73:52.09]We actually have to traverse.
[73:55.09]Carpe's Landing, right?
[73:56.47]Right here.
[74:01.63]Wait, no, what the hell is this place?
[74:08.78]Can I go here?
[74:10.44]Is this town?
[74:11.06]Am I allowed here?
[74:15.24]I think I'm going too fast.
[74:16.46]Alright.
[74:17.66]Can I come out?
[74:18.06]Is this where I need to be?
[74:19.91]Other side.

[75:13.18]Alright, slow down.
[75:13.80]I need to park this thing here.
[75:15.40]Alright, come on.
[75:19.11]Oh, look at this.
[75:19.95]What can I get for a million and a half dollars worth of gold? 2,880?
[75:41.35]I don't think I would want to bring this up here.
[75:42.99]Like, you know... So I've got, uh... I've got, like, $40 million worth of gold, and I've noticed you've got a handgun back there.
[75:53.48]Wow, I wonder if you're gonna use that on anybody.
[75:56.48]Yeah, I mean, I'm just here, just me.
[75:58.74]Crew is on the boat back there, but you got a clean shot.
[76:02.44]Alright, what do we do?
[76:04.89]How do I upgrade?
[76:10.80]Hey boys!
[76:11.08]What do you think I should buy?
[76:17.53]See how much I care about money?
[76:18.61]I don't even care.
[76:22.33]It's not about how much gold you have.
[76:23.81]It's about sending a message.
[76:33.36]Alright, does this guy like jump on top of me and tackle me into the water?
[76:45.62]What can I buy?
[76:46.16]Ooh, what's this?
[76:48.75]Harpy's Landing.
[76:49.53]You got it.
[76:49.95]Alright.
[76:50.35]I want to buy stuff.
[76:52.01]What's this?
[76:53.41]Wait.
[76:53.95]What do I do?
[76:57.87]No!
[76:58.37]Come back.
[76:58.71]Come back.
[76:58.99]Come back.
[76:59.23]Come back.
[76:59.57]I thought this... Oh.
[77:00.39]Ahoy, landlubber.
[77:02.75]Welcome to me shop.
[77:04.39]Have a look at me wares.
[77:05.97]You can put whatever you wish to buy in the chest over here.
[77:09.86]I actually... Hey, knock it off.
[77:16.02]Okay.
[77:17.84]A thousand of these?
[77:20.36]I would like... Is this like the last hole of the mini golf course?
[77:24.37]Where the ball just disappears?
[77:25.85]Which, by the way, when I was a kid, that always freaked me out.
[77:32.51]Because you go... Where do those balls go?
[77:44.21]There's some secret weird underground facility where those balls go at the end of the mini golf course.
[77:48.75]Where do they go?
[77:57.25]Into a bucket.
[77:57.87]But like, how?
[77:59.85]Does somebody have to like climb down a ladder into like a mine shaft and get those balls?
[78:04.31]Where do they go?
[78:10.51]Yes, they do.
[78:11.31]There's a big bucket under there.
[78:17.03]Okay, what am I buying?
[78:17.91]Oh, I want... That's 10 of these, please.
[78:21.50]I would like 20 of these, because my crew is... They're idiots, and they don't know how to load it themselves.
[78:28.88]Okay, that's 3,000.
[78:32.80]I want a bunch of these.
[78:35.56]I'm going to do one more mission, because I think this game is actually really fun.
[78:42.00]Look, can you just bring up five?
[78:44.46]Why do I have to do individual pieces?
[78:46.38]Here.
[78:48.24]Solid.
[78:51.11]Uh, sir, that's just dehydrated dog poop.
[78:55.31]Oi!
[78:56.11]Run, lads!
[78:58.34]Uh, alright, so... What is this?
[79:05.63]Buy the goat?
[79:17.70]Cool.
[79:18.10]Oh, I want some of these too.
[79:21.78]The pirate is paying for supplies.
[79:23.92]This guy would have been dead an hour ago.
[79:32.08]Oh no, my gold!
[79:37.26]Should I... Okay, hold on.
[79:42.69]Is there upgrades for the boat?
[79:45.72]Oh, no.
[79:45.88]Okay, well.
[79:46.36]So, what do I got?
[79:46.81]Sixty.
[79:46.93]Sixty.
[79:47.05]Nice.
[79:47.15]Where's the, uh, where's the lion thing that I bought?
[80:04.04]Check the far left.
[80:05.14]If I need a better view of my surroundings, I can always use the magnifying glass near the bottom corner of the map to zoom in or out.
[80:12.60]Alright, I gotta go to Harpy's Landing.
[80:13.90]That's the mission, right?
[80:15.92]We gotta go this way.
[80:16.74]Alright, let's shove off.
[80:18.28]Times 20... What is that?
[80:24.68]What am I looking at here?
[80:29.49]Ring the bell three times without letting go.
[80:34.83]What am I doing up here?
[80:37.97]Oh my god, I just used one.
[80:39.57]Okay, that's what that does.
[80:42.32]Why would I be, like, up there?
[80:43.82]Okay, let's keep going.
[80:47.14]We gotta go to this carpy's landing.
[80:50.22]Gonna bang a right.
[80:54.42]But you know I'm gonna have to do that to somebody, right?
[81:04.83]Walk the deck?
[81:06.39]I don't think I can leave this post here.
[81:07.87]Alright, we're going to thread the needle right there.
[81:13.23]Which will take us... We go straight through there all the way to Harpy's Landing.
[81:18.19]Let's open it up.
[81:19.15]Go full speed.
[81:19.87]Are we already at full speed?
[81:25.90]These things didn't go very fast, huh?
[81:30.76]How do you make a ship go faster?
[81:32.86]And is it possible to have a ship go too fast, but we're going like 1 to 200 miles per hour?
[81:37.88]Okay, if there were like 80 mile per hour gusts at sea, and we had like 30 of those lined up, but we'd be going 200 miles per hour, like holding onto the edge, screaming, because our legs are in the air flying up, what would happen?
[81:50.43]Alright, we got somebody right here.
[82:00.67]Put it in drive.
[82:01.37]Alright, we're ready.
[82:02.72]Let's go.
[82:03.74]Should I try this?
[82:04.34]Alright, let's ram this guy.
[82:12.58]Why is the music just still playing like this?
[82:14.44]Here we go.
[82:15.64]One, two, three.
[82:17.84]Got him!
[82:24.62]Got him!
[82:35.61]We got 70 binoculars, what are those?
[82:37.40]Oh wait, which way are we going?
[82:43.72]Turn around, turn around, we're going the wrong way.
[82:49.10]We gotta go that way.
[82:50.85]Uh oh.
[83:01.02]Well, that was a... That's a runtime error.
[83:11.13]Okay, well, we're moving on to the next one.
[83:14.52]Damn it, that was kind of fun too.
[83:15.78]Alright, well, we got to move on anyways.
[83:27.76]Alright, coming up next, we're going to do... I expect you to die.
[83:30.58]I'm so mad.
[83:31.60]I really wanted to play that.
[83:32.44]We're going to do Cooking Simulator VR.
[83:33.68]Let's see how this is.
[83:44.37]Not enough RAM.
[83:47.59]Is it a tuber game?
[83:48.85]Well, I played this game a lot a few years ago.
[83:51.15]Come on.
[83:55.32]Give me some credit here.
[84:06.02]I expect you to die is really good.
[84:07.34]Maybe I'll, maybe I'll, I'm going to reload it.
[84:08.68]Make sure I can see you guys.
[84:18.25]Okay.
[84:21.89]This is way too loud for me.
[84:23.57]I got to turn this way down.
[84:32.37]That's much better.
[84:33.03]Louder?
[84:37.17]Not louder, why?
[84:38.09]Home Depot.
[84:42.20]What was that laugh?
[85:01.39]Oh, Home Depot.
[85:08.15]Okay.
[85:09.31]This is kind of ugly.
[85:13.17]Alright, settings.
[85:14.41]Settings, where are we?
[85:15.69]Where are you?
[85:18.03]There you are.
[85:18.55]Okay.
[85:21.29]Let's do settings.
[85:25.95]Settings.
[85:27.45]Graphics, put them on high.
[85:30.13]Color grading, bloom, turn that off.
[85:31.98]Who wants to have bloom ever?
[85:34.24]Yeah, I guess it's staying on.
[85:43.08]Oh.
[85:44.77]Movement smooth, rotation smooth.
[85:46.73]Head position offset.
[85:50.25]Remote grab, sprinkles by shake.
[85:53.97]Okay, turn this fucking music off.
[86:03.74]Hands position?
[86:04.62]I think that's fine.
[86:08.24]Input.
[86:09.84]Grab.
[86:10.40]Use Blender.
[86:14.04]Okay, so it's like grab, grab.
[86:16.53]Grab is grab.
[86:18.13]Use Blender is... Crouch is A. Why would you need to tiptoe?
[86:23.37]Double click A. Pause menu is... What the fuck?
[86:29.50]Okay.
[86:30.92]What?
[86:31.08]No, hold on.
[86:31.50]What the hell is that?
[86:34.74]These two at the same time?
[86:35.96]Okay.
[86:37.28]Remote grab.
[86:38.50]Hold this and press that.
[86:43.46]I'm ready!
[86:48.43]I'm ready!
[86:48.81]Uh... I can't... Okay, I don't know how to play it in VR, though.
[86:59.07]Let's get... Let's do the tutorial.
[87:01.93]The game's gonna crash if you don't put it in low.
[87:05.01]I got a 3090.
[87:05.57]It just heats up VR games until they crash.
[87:16.58]Who said fuck condoms?
[87:19.20]What are you trying to, what are you doing?
[87:21.73]What?
[87:22.39]Fuck condoms, dude.
[87:23.69]Oh, I hate those.
[87:25.37]What?
[87:25.59]Alright, here we go.
[87:27.75]Pause.
[87:29.49]What?
[87:34.68]Okay, using a knife, most products can be sliced into smaller pieces.
[87:37.52]Grab a knife, cut four slices of bread.
[87:40.14]Is that four?
[87:50.17]Whoa, this is cool.
[87:53.21]Okay, I got four slices of bread.
[87:55.09]What about a plate?
[88:02.27]Nice.
[88:02.69]Oh, this is going to be fun.
[88:03.45]I love this.
[88:03.95]We're going to be here for a while.
[88:05.97]You finished the tutorial.
[88:09.20]Very cool.
[88:10.22]Very, very cool.
[88:11.12]Oh, my God.
[88:11.90]This is great.
[88:12.50]I can't wait to play this.
[88:15.72]Remote grabbing.
[88:16.50]Press trigger and point your hand, and then grab and go like that.
[88:24.68]Nice.
[88:25.14]Okay.
[88:26.70]Turn on the grill.
[88:29.22]Turn over the steaks using the grill.
[88:30.70]I don't...
[88:33.68]I don't have to do that?
[88:35.24]Wait until the steaks are ready.
[88:45.10]Holy shit, this is fun!
[88:46.26]This is actually really good.
[88:51.21]Okay, that's cool.
[88:55.45]No, you're gonna press all the juices out!
[88:56.85]Don't touch it!
[89:01.74]I can't wait, okay, cool.
[89:03.44]What do we do with this?
[89:05.86]Seasoning, there are three types of seasoning, liquid, herb, dry, yeah, let's try to add some flavor.
[89:09.69]Use five kilograms of salt, three kilograms of thyme, okay, five kilograms of salt, this is salt right here, right?
[89:21.96]Oops, that's a lot.
[89:23.30]Minus, wait, what?
[89:25.46]Oh, cool, okay.
[89:27.35]How much do you need salt and then three of thyme?
[89:29.31]This is thyme right here, right?
[89:30.95]I don't know.
[89:32.31]Why is it not on, why is it not listed?
[89:33.85]How come it's not listed on here?
[89:42.53]Okay.
[89:44.21]Three of cilantro, 10 of clarified butter.
[89:47.70]Is this clarified butter?

[90:05.33]Oh, that's the wrong thing.
[90:06.37]I get it.
[90:13.53]I know how it works.

[94:11.39]Is this an onion?
[94:11.87]This is technically an onion, right?

[95:39.53]Alright, that's fine.
[95:48.49]Why is that not right?
[95:52.23]Do I have to get it exact?

[96:04.11]Ten.
[96:07.70]Salt.
[96:16.02]Five.
[96:16.50]Okay.
[96:20.96]Three of time.

[96:35.14]One, two, three, four, five.
[96:38.48]I shook it five times.

[137:44.43]It was motor oil.
[137:45.83]Motor oil.
[137:47.81]And I'm not talking about that's the consistency.
[137:49.39]That's what it was.
[137:50.75]I watched you pour it in there.
[137:52.79]Valvoline.
[137:54.72]Yeah.
[137:55.06]I don't know how to use a knife, Chef.
[138:00.50]I have no idea.

[138:38.17]What, are you out of your fucking mind?
[138:39.47]Huh?

[138:58.52]I know all the fucking jokes everybody knows.
[139:00.06]Alright, I need salmon, salmon, salmon.
[139:16.52]Oh, Mr. Ramsay, I've got a special delicious dish for you.
[139:19.70]Do you think I would get kicked off immediately if I was like walking around like this?
[139:25.36]Okay, here we go.
[139:26.48]I need more potatoes.
[139:39.33]Oh, bugs in the pan.
[139:44.01]Potatoes, two potatoes and water.
[139:54.31]What am I doing?
[139:54.77]Oh.
[139:54.95]Let's go!
[140:09.76]Salt it up!
[140:20.04]Oh yeah, I hate that shit.
[140:21.72]I hate that more than anything.
[140:24.41]I hate that.
[140:25.81]The, like, wafting shit.
[140:27.23]No, don't do that.
[140:28.21]Get away from me with that shit.
[140:29.63]It's just weird.
[140:32.88]Why do people do that?
[140:34.82]I swear to God, people do that.
[140:36.48]They pretend.
[140:37.90]I know I've talked about this before.
[140:40.86]Going like... Stop.
[140:44.22]Just go like this.
[140:46.46]It's so gross to me.
[140:48.67]I don't know why.
[140:49.29]I hate it.
[140:55.51]It's a basic... I know, but, like, it's something about it just... I hate everything about it.
[141:03.02]What, it's going like this?
[141:04.56]What, can I, like, breathe in the vapors and, like, burn my nose?
[141:15.09]Yes.
[141:18.17]What if you leaned in and got boogers in it?
[141:21.00]What if I went like this and my sweat on my hand dropped in?
[141:24.88]That argument does not hold any weight for me at all.
[141:30.75]I need a plate.
[141:43.54]What's he doing?
[141:45.52]Oh, what is he doing?
[142:03.40]They love my food.
[142:05.31]They love my food.
[142:06.81]They just do.
[142:09.85]Not bad.
[142:12.71]Booger?
[142:17.63]What is... Booger.
[142:21.54]Guys, I don't know who you think I am, or what you think is kind of wrong with me, but there's not just water dripping out of my nose.
[142:30.78]I...
[142:32.17]The water's not just constant.
[142:33.34]If I lean over something, I'm not just gonna like... Huh?
[142:39.02]What are you talking about?
[142:42.34]Make a lemon soup.
[142:43.34]Oh, that's a good idea.
[142:46.00]I'm getting so tangled up.
[142:48.23]That's a good idea.
[142:49.07]Lemon soup?
[142:49.91]Sure.
[143:05.42]This is gonna make a lot.
[143:06.30]Okay.
[143:12.18]Start the boiling process here.
[143:15.33]So I need lemons.
[143:17.21]Should I cut them up?
[143:17.85]What do you think?
[143:26.46]Um.
[143:30.00]Just boil them with the rinds on?
[143:35.85]Maybe an onion?
[143:44.62]And then mush them up?
[143:46.60]I need to stick blend them.
[143:50.26]Okay.
[143:53.54]Ooh, it's actually turning.
[143:54.24]That's cool.
[144:06.24]Do I have more?
[144:09.63]Wait, what if I like boiled a piece of salmon in there?
[144:12.43]Would that be good?
[144:13.05]Would that taste good?
[144:14.97]That would be kind of interesting.
[144:28.14]No, why would I?
[144:28.60]Yeah, salt can go in there.
[144:33.03]Salt and pepper.
[144:37.71]Looks good.
[144:40.73]It looks like it's cooking.
[144:41.47]Hold on.
[144:48.98]I'm making baby food.
[144:51.36]These are the ingredients on the back of like a Gerber salmon paste.
[144:56.10]Hold it.
[144:56.38]How many can I put in there?
[145:12.04]This is gross.
[145:13.26]And I just wasted like $30.
[145:14.02]What baby?
[145:17.21]What do you mean baby?
[145:19.71]Baby, do not... Don't feed this to babies.
[145:21.37]What?
[145:21.55]I don't understand.
[145:25.15]Wait, what are you talking about?
[145:27.58]What are you talking about?
[145:37.02]Babies...
[145:39.72]Well, I'm not saying that you feed this to a baby.
[145:41.36]I'm just saying like that, like this is like, you put like a bunch of paste into a jar.
[145:45.64]You just grind up a bunch of stuff and it turns into baby, like peas and carrots and I don't know, whatever it else is.
[145:50.48]Mushrooms?
[145:50.84]I don't know what else is in it.
[145:52.16]What's in baby food?
[145:53.90]Peas, carrots.
[145:56.29]What else is in baby food?
[145:58.59]Is it just ground up peas?
[146:07.81]Hello?
[146:10.25]What happened?
[146:13.11]Somebody said going to say, yeah, let me, I'm going to go to sandbox mode.
[146:20.96]I want to do sandbox mode.
[146:21.90]I want to just, I want to make like pizzas and shit.
[146:28.34]Yeah, we're doing sandbox.
[146:33.41]Make a hamburger helper.
[146:34.95]I will make hamburger helper for you.
[146:36.25]I will.
[146:37.61]Let's do sandbox.
[146:47.41]I just burped.
[146:47.87]I'm so sorry.
[147:00.23]Ooh, new kitchen.
[147:04.18]Hell yeah.
[147:04.50]Alright.
[147:06.24]Now it's time for me to make you my famous hamburger helper.
[147:08.36]It's very easy to make.
[147:13.15]The beef stroganoff is probably my favorite.
[147:14.74]I think cheeseburger macaroni is pretty good too, but I don't think it's as good as the stroganoff.
[147:23.30]Oh, damn.
[147:26.04]Okay.
[147:29.64]What do we got?
[147:33.89]Right here, we'll start with... I just want to wreck this place.
[147:41.07]Okay, what do we got?
[147:43.12]First of all, let's get a plate.
[147:44.68]If you're going to have Hamburger Helper, you need one of these because it's literally just shlop.
[147:49.56]It's just shlop.
[147:51.34]It's just a big thing of shlop, and that's all it is.
[147:55.56]Start.
[147:56.08]Get our prep station ready, please.
[148:02.98]Okay.
[148:06.09]Michael Jackson?
[148:09.23]I need to put two on.
[148:10.89]I don't want to be like, okay.
[148:13.74]Should I even have gloves?
[148:18.64]Oh, you do asparagus too?
[148:19.98]Nice.
[148:25.44]Dr. Shlop.
[148:28.42]Bacon?
[148:28.96]Hold on, I just wanna, I want bacon.
[148:31.74]What is this tiny little shit bacon?
[148:33.60]What?
[148:37.22]This is bacon?
[148:40.61]This is not bacon.
[148:46.84]Holy shit, a banana.
[148:50.46]Alright, stop messing around.
[148:52.92]Burger meat, do they just have ground beef?
[149:00.06]We'll make cheeseburger mac.
[149:04.26]Need a few of these.
[149:04.96]Okay, burger meat, but do they have ground beef?
[149:17.55]Goat cheese, disgusting.
[149:20.34]Absolutely revolting.
[149:24.04]I don't see G, ground beef.
[149:30.32]I don't see it.
[149:33.95]No, they have hamburger meat, like burger meat, but I feel like this is a patty.
[149:41.09]Probably is, right?
[149:42.91]Yeah, can I chop this up?
[149:54.35]I can chop this up, right?
[149:55.15]Okay, I need like a pound.
[150:02.39]And then we'll also do... Oh, there's beef chuck.
[150:09.50]Wait, can I grind this up?
[150:10.38]Do I have a grinder?
[150:19.43]Is this a grinder?
[150:30.85]I mean, these chunks are too big.
[150:34.61]Can I do it to the patty?
[150:46.48]No.
[150:47.14]Oh, I can.
[150:48.10]Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[150:48.81]Right, right, okay, okay.
[150:49.87]Can I chop these up even thinner and finer?
[150:51.43]Let me see a knife.
[150:54.79]Let me see if I can chop this up.
[151:02.77]No.
[151:04.75]Alright, this is gonna have to do.
[151:09.03]This will have to do.
[151:10.05]Get it in here.
[151:14.12]Blend the beef?
[151:22.52]Um, no.
[151:23.92]No, we're not doing that.
[151:25.57]What do I do with this?
[151:27.11]No, I'm not gonna feed it to the plant.
[151:31.69]We're not doing that.
[151:35.62]Alright, just put these over here.
[151:36.44]Cause I'm going to ground all this up.
[151:39.57]We're going to grind the cheese too.
[151:40.89]It'll be nice and melty.
[151:47.35]Ooh.
[151:47.71]Alright.
[151:47.99]Let's do this real quick.
[151:56.96]Oops.
[151:57.24]That was a mistake.
[151:58.44]It's okay.
[152:11.67]God damn it.
[152:18.07]This is as ground as it's going to be.
[152:20.37]Which is fine.
[152:20.83]Let's get it all.
[152:27.32]There it is.
[152:28.76]There's our ground beef.
[152:30.02]Let's go ahead and get it over on the stove area here.
[152:33.74]Not going to cook it yet.
[152:35.12]Just going to get it there.
[152:35.86]Because we've got to brown that meat first and foremost.
[152:41.66]After you brown the meat, you're going to add your cheese and sauce and your macaroni, which we need to get that too.
[152:47.06]Alright.
[152:49.95]Macaroni.
[152:51.23]Hmm.
[152:55.83]Which one do I want?
[152:56.95]This one here probably is the one that looks the most.
[152:59.14]Can I see what it looks like?
[153:00.76]Yep.
[153:01.14]That looks like it's it.
[153:03.78]Okay.
[153:05.24]Sounds good.
[153:09.28]Prep that over here.
[153:10.16]I need a thing to boil this with.
[153:16.42]I'll give me that pan right here.
[153:17.64]Alright, so we're going to go like this.
[153:20.80]How do you turn on one of these fucking stoves?
[153:34.43]Alright, that's on.
[153:35.09]I need water in here.
[153:37.47]I mean, technically, you don't do that.
[153:40.29]You don't cook the pasta cooks in the sauce mix.
[153:43.68]Well, we need milk.
[153:47.26]This kitchen's too big.
[153:48.40]I don't know how people have kitchens like this.
[153:55.40]Alright, I need milk and water.
[153:57.83]Where's milk?
[154:06.03]Do I not have milk?
[154:09.20]Oh, here it is.
[154:09.64]Okay.
[154:10.92]Alright, we're going to do a little bit of this.
[154:16.15]We've got to get our station ready.
[154:18.41]Okay, where's the pasta?
[154:21.87]Where's the sink?
[154:25.95]Where's the sink?
[154:27.71]Oh.
[154:30.40]How are you supposed to use this thing?
[154:40.33]A little bit more.
[154:40.73]Okay.
[154:43.36]Sounds, don't spill it.
[154:46.28]Get that boiling.
[154:47.40]Ow.
[154:54.00]That hurt.
[154:55.66]I'm fine though.
[154:56.14]Don't worry about me.
[154:57.12]Okay.
[154:57.34]So now that's going to boil.
[155:01.21]Let's get the pasta in there.
[155:02.33]Put the milk in there too.
[155:09.11]That's all that's in this box?
[155:13.45]Um, no way.
[155:14.55]What?
[155:18.25]That's it?
[155:23.71]Well, back to the pantry, I guess.
[155:28.18]Are you serious?
[155:33.10]I need... Where's my device?
[155:37.00]Hold on.
[155:42.13]I didn't want to buy that.
[155:43.41]Okay, I need... Good.
[155:55.78]I don't need sour cream.
[155:59.82]Okay, I need... What do I need?

[156:20.12]Stool?
[156:23.62]Oh.
[156:25.24]Look at that.
[156:27.12]That is not what that looks like.
[156:32.00]Then you know it.
[156:35.68]Where... Where's the, um...
[156:42.83]Where's the pasta?
[156:44.89]Spices.
[156:45.91]Products, right?
[156:46.51]You would imagine.
[156:50.50]I don't see it anywhere.
[156:57.82]Where the hell is it?
[157:03.07]Oh, I missed it.
[157:03.79]What is it?
[157:04.29]What the hell is it called?
[157:06.25]Busy?
[157:08.51]Busy?
[157:12.20]Fousey?
[157:13.68]Fouseely.
[157:16.22]Alright.
[157:17.10]I need, like, three of these.
[157:18.16]Alright, let's go.
[157:43.61]fucking scam do I need more water?
[157:55.56]I need more water in here
[158:17.26]Wait.
[158:18.42]Hold on.
[158:21.46]Can I scoop it back into there with anything?
[158:23.58]Or do I have to do this whole thing again?
[158:24.84]Hold on.
[158:26.31]Let me scrape it out of the bottom of the sink.
[158:29.89]Hold on.
[158:32.77]Dude, that's so stupid.
[158:35.59]Oh, my God.
[158:36.29]Just give me another few boxes.
[158:39.49]Ow.
[158:44.49]That's going to make me puke, by the way.
[158:49.89]Pieces.
[158:55.69]Dropping the whole thing in the sink.
[158:57.73]You know what sucks?
[159:00.18]I've done that before.
[159:01.30]I have taken a strainer and poured wet hot pasta into it and it was like a little too heavy and it was a little too hot and I dropped it into the sink.
[159:11.32]It's happened before.
[159:12.94]It sucks.
[159:15.40]Alright, let me get back to where I was.
[159:22.24]We don't need this much pasta.
[159:32.81]I mean, we do because it's Hamburger Helper.
[159:34.35]It's just schlop.
[159:35.09]That's all it is.
[159:37.05]This will be enough.
[159:38.63]Yeah, this is more than enough.
[159:41.27]Go back to cooking this pasta.
[159:47.06]Okay, here we go.
[159:49.64]The game does not like this at all.
[159:53.12]The game hates that there's that much pasta in there.
[159:55.00]Okay.
[159:55.72]Now let's continue.
[159:57.54]Get our milk in there.
[160:02.68]That's a lot, but it's okay.
[160:06.44]Where's our cheese?
[160:17.27]Is that going to melt?
[160:19.25]Does the cheese melt in this game?
[160:22.51]I don't know.
[160:22.83]Does the cheese melt?
[160:25.91]I need another pan, please.
[160:37.78]Oh, no.
[160:38.20]It's melting.
[160:38.60]It is.
[160:42.55]Turn it on, dude.
[160:44.07]What are you doing?
[160:45.61]Turn it on.
[160:46.25]Is that our ground beef?
[160:57.80]And you just want to get this to brown.
[160:58.96]You just want it to brown a little bit.
[161:16.68]Okay, what are you doing?
[161:23.14]Is this cooking?
[161:28.06]What's going on?
[161:34.11]Okay, there we go.
[161:35.73]Let that cook for a little longer.
[161:36.87]Our pasta and our cheese sauce is here.
[161:39.73]I also like to add a little bit of onion, if you have it.
[161:51.39]What's in here?
[162:06.79]Some of these pieces need to be moved around because they're going to cook.
[162:08.99]You got to mush them up.
[162:10.23]You got to break it up with a fork or break it up with a utensil.
[162:17.86]Some of them are not going to cook completely evenly, but that's okay.
[162:22.00]They'll finish off in the other pan we're going to use, which by the way, I need one.
[162:27.25]It's just cook.
[162:28.07]Fucking cook already.
[162:29.41]Cook.
[162:34.25]There we go.
[162:34.55]Okay.
[162:36.46]I need a saucepan.
[162:38.24]Just like a deep kind of saucepan.
[162:42.52]The game really hates that there's that much macaroni in there.
[162:45.59]Hates it.
[162:48.57]Big pot.
[162:50.11]Bake tray, blowtorch, bucket.
[162:55.21]No, no, no.
[162:55.81]Grill pan?
[162:57.22]Is this what I need?
[162:59.10]No, I already have one of those.
[163:04.32]Paella pan?
[163:08.06]It'll okay.
[163:08.72]It'll do it'll work.
[163:09.58]It'll do it'll do So he's gonna set this one here on low don't want it to be too bad is it on Okay, oh No, oh no, it's okay.
[163:27.99]It's alright.
[163:28.37]Sorry.
[163:28.51]It's alright.
[163:28.77]Oh
[163:37.42]Then we're going to take our pasta mixture with the cheese sauce.
[163:44.55]And there's our hamburger helper.
[163:48.87]Got to Ster it up a little bit, though.
[163:50.01]Remember, this is the cheeseburger macaroni version.
[164:06.48]We can turn that off.
[164:08.72]And we can get this, we can scoop this out onto a plate now.
[164:10.82]There it is.
[164:11.63]Looks pretty good.
[164:13.33]If you want to grate a little bit of cheese on top, that's up to you.
[164:16.83]That's completely up to you.
[164:21.58]But there it is.
[164:22.02]There's our cheeseburger mac.
[164:24.34]We need that deep plate here.
[164:36.82]Okay.
[164:39.18]Oh, this is a two hander.
[164:48.92]And there it is.
[164:51.04]There it is.
[164:51.42]A mess.
[165:01.12]You know, it's kind of funny.
[165:03.70]I feel like over the course of my life,
[165:06.81]I feel like I have seen this exact image.
[165:10.22]Whenever you make a bunch of food that's really, really kind of a pain in the ass to make or gets really messy, I've left it like this for hours at a time.
[165:20.48]I have like spilled, dumped, and gotten it like there where it's like I got two servings maybe, and I just leave that shit.
[165:28.19]You know what?
[165:28.49]Like I could, but I want to eat.
[165:29.93]And then, you know what?
[165:30.49]I kind of want to watch TV.
[165:32.49]So it just stays there for like two or three hours.
[165:35.57]And then eventually, finally, you're like, you know what?
[165:37.51]I probably should... They're adhered to the counter, so it's probably time to take them up.
[165:42.94]You know, you're like... Okay, there's a little bit of give there.
[165:47.66]And you clean the counter and everything.
[165:53.79]Oh, oh, oh, it smells so good.
[165:55.63]Now we're going to make a pot roast.
[166:20.26]You good?
[166:20.96]Yeah.
[166:22.70]Boil it in the cheese water.
[166:26.96]What you want to do is you want to brown it a little bit.
[166:29.15]Are you going to put the au jus on top?
[166:50.15]How do I restart?
[166:51.17]I want to restart.
[166:51.77]I want to do another one.
[166:57.93]Boil it.
[166:58.43]Okay.
[166:58.95]I want to see what happens if you take a pot roast and you put it in the microwave for 15 minutes, what happens?
[167:08.21]I did it.
[167:08.53]Is it like a Thanksgiving Turkey that I can put in the microwave?
[167:13.26]I hope so.
[167:20.97]There's beef chuck.
[167:23.96]Okay.
[167:24.96]What about like full turkey?
[167:29.62]I could make like a hamburger too.
[167:31.14]Yeah, I want to make a burger for you guys.
[167:32.32]I want to make my... Oh!
[167:35.58]I'm going to make you guys two or three of my favorite burgers.
[167:39.06]And I'm not kidding.
[167:41.91]I just heard Holly laugh.
[167:44.51]I just heard her laugh.
[167:46.93]What happened?
[167:47.83]What?
[167:48.11]My burger?
[167:48.87]You don't like my burgers?
[167:53.17]She pretends to like them, okay?
[167:59.43]Okay, so I'm going to make you three of my favorite hamburgers.
[168:01.57]We're going to need that pan.
[168:06.59]I have pretty interesting burgers that I like.
[168:10.95]It's my go-to's.
[168:12.87]We'll see how you guys like them.
[168:15.31]First of all, we need cheese.
[168:19.95]I need lettuce.
[168:24.86]Wait, I can make corn on the cob?
[168:29.24]Holy shit.
[168:29.70]I'll use it for later.
[168:32.81]No, I know I'm not one of those people that's going to put an egg on it, so don't worry.
[168:42.03]Okay.
[168:44.92]Very nice.
[168:45.80]Just need one.
[168:49.76]I need, like, can I chop up these onions?
[168:53.66]I can chop the onions, right?
[168:59.49]a couple of onions uh no no no no wait how big is this alright that's huge we're gonna put that in the microwave as well how big is this what is this weird okay wait I don't want cabbage I want lettuce

[170:04.19]Miscellaneous, I don't, where, what would it be?
[170:06.51]I don't think it's in the game.
[170:12.97]It's cabbage.
[170:23.16]Basil leaf, asparagus, bay leaf, broccoli.
[170:29.93]Chives, cilantro, cucumber, dill.
[170:33.96]I do want to make a few eggs.
[170:37.42]I'm just curious of how that worked.
[170:42.52]Green bell pepper.
[170:43.76]No, it's not here.
[170:45.34]Mint.
[170:45.82]I could probably get mint leaf and pretend it's lettuce.
[170:47.30]Alright.
[170:49.27]It's going to have to be the cabbage.
[170:51.79]Yeah.
[170:52.05]Unfortunately, it has to be the cabbage because I can't.
[170:54.03]There's no lettuce.
[170:59.09]No, it's not there.
[171:02.67]What about sage leaf?
[171:04.99]No, that doesn't look like lettuce.
[171:09.27]It kind of does.
[171:10.09]I need a lot of it, though.
[171:12.81]What happens if I chop this?
[171:13.85]Is this going to look like a brain the whole time?
[171:20.88]The parsley leaves might look like lettuce.
[171:23.96]Yeah, okay, okay.
[171:24.82]We're going to get a shitload of parsley leaves.
[171:26.20]Because this looks kind of like lettuce, and that's all I'm looking for, is the look.
[171:39.10]Okay, that'll look like lettuce on the burger.
[171:40.79]That's fine.
[171:43.31]Romaine?
[171:46.71]No, it's not there.
[171:47.89]There's no romaine, man.
[171:49.71]Okay.
[171:51.53]Now I need... I need onions.
[171:54.27]Okay, onions.
[171:55.55]Where's mayo?
[171:56.09]Where's mayonnaise?

[172:07.91]You don't have mayo?
[172:08.85]You got like mustard, olive oil, milk, there's no mayo?
[172:14.31]What?

[172:28.28]What kind of oil is it?
[172:30.26]It's olive oil, right?
[172:35.46]Olive oil and eggs.
[172:37.49]And just whip it up.
[172:41.89]And vinegar, yeah.
[172:45.87]Alright, where are those eggs?
[173:05.37]These eggs are huge!
[173:09.93]Okay.
[173:12.35]Where's the blender?
[173:15.23]Over there.
[173:15.53]Are we going to make our own homemade mayonnaise?
[173:21.02]Okay.
[173:21.34]Where's the, uh, where's the blender?
[173:25.16]Where is it?
[173:27.90]Where's the blender top thing?
[173:28.86]Do I have to buy it?
[173:30.72]This is the Jerma meal.
[173:37.36]I think I have to buy it, right?
[173:45.06]What the fuck is this?
[173:47.62]What?
[173:54.18]What is it called?
[173:59.49]There we go!
[174:00.75]Wait, where's the food processor?

[174:10.18]Okay, alright.
[174:16.75]We need oil.
[174:17.37]Uh, white vinegar.
[174:29.32]I don't know how much I'm supposed to use.
[174:30.68]And then I need my eggs.
[174:35.95]That's gonna be disgusting.
[174:39.45]How many eggs do you put in?
[174:40.45]How do you make mayonnaise?
[174:43.33]Look, I'm making my secret patties for you guys.
[174:48.24]Oops.
[174:52.80]How does this work?
[175:00.54]There are shells in here.
[175:05.84]You know what?
[175:06.36]Doesn't matter.
[175:07.44]It's fine.
[175:09.16]It'll be fine.
[175:09.60]We got our eggs.
[175:11.24]I need a few more.
[175:11.86]What's happening?
[175:12.66]Oh, I need more oil.
[175:18.53]Shut up.
[175:20.62]Okay.
[175:21.30]I need a couple more eggs.
[175:41.74]Okay.
[175:43.19]Now we need a, we need a little bit of a kick.
[175:46.69]I'm going to say, let's go to the spice rack.
[175:52.31]And what do I want to put in here?
[175:53.43]I want to put in some, some things here, pepper, a little bit of, uh, garlic.
[176:07.64]Oh, yo, hold on a second.
[176:12.52]Hold on a minute.
[176:13.14]Okay.
[176:17.96]I want some garlic.
[176:24.84]Garlic.
[176:25.32]I want like two things of garlic.
[176:29.50]And then I think that that's alright.
[176:32.12]Maybe a little bit, maybe a little bit of salt.
[176:37.18]Okay.
[176:37.48]I think that's going to be fine.
[176:38.38]That's easy.
[176:39.64]Get this on the food processor.
[176:42.87]And let's begin.
[176:43.39]That's our fresh mayo.
[176:55.35]Let's try it.
[176:59.02]Thickness seems pretty good.
[177:07.82]That's alright.
[177:08.28]That's good.
[177:09.94]We got our mayo.
[177:14.64]I can sit right here.
[177:15.90]Don't have to do anything else with that.
[177:17.16]I can stay there for now.
[177:18.00]That's considered room temp.
[177:21.48]You made paint thinner.
[177:22.50]It's mayonnaise.
[177:23.34]Just relax.
[177:24.04]Why everybody hate mayonnaise so much?
[177:26.72]You like eggs.
[177:27.61]You like oil.
[177:29.75]You like creaminess.
[177:32.03]So what's the problem?
[177:33.39]Oh, mayo, gross.
[177:35.99]I don't get what the issue is.
[177:41.20]What's the issue?
[177:44.45]Alright.
[177:46.18]Let's make, let's cook these burgers up.
[177:49.46]I am going to do my first burger.
[177:51.34]Very simple.
[177:52.54]There's nothing too crazy about it.
[177:54.50]I need an onion.
[177:58.52]This is my go-to though, is a knife.
[178:02.48]Thank you.
[178:04.78]These onions have to be chopped fairly thin.
[178:09.03]And then we have to cook these because they need to be grilled onions.
[178:11.01]They have to be grilled onions.
[178:27.76]I like them nice and chopped and thin.
[178:30.18]Get away from me.
[178:32.42]Get away from me!
[178:40.40]That's alright.
[178:40.74]You get the idea.
[178:44.22]Because I can't seem to cut these any more than I already have.
[178:54.88]Alright, you get the idea.
[178:56.96]These are our onions.
[178:58.28]Let's go ahead and start sweating those out.
[179:01.22]Let's go and start sweating those out, guys.
[179:15.49]Okay, let's go and start sweating those out.
[179:22.31]Once those are done sweating a little bit, you just want to let them breathe a little.
[179:28.02]Give them a shake.
[179:30.88]Once those are ready, we can move on to the next step.
[179:40.17]Oh, excellent.
[179:45.17]Those are good to go.
[179:45.83]Those are good to go.
[179:46.63]Get them off.
[179:48.83]Okay, we've got our grilled onions.
[179:50.92]I need a little bit of oil for this pan so I can get one of these burgers going, by the way.
[179:56.56]Rare?
[179:57.30]No.
[179:57.88]Medium rare?
[179:58.58]No.
[179:59.24]We do medium in this house.
[180:01.50]This is a medium household.
[180:02.56]I don't even know if I'm talking to you.
[180:05.30]I probably am not.
[180:07.47]Yeah, I am.
[180:08.43]I'm a medium household.
[180:11.99]I do not do medium rare.
[180:14.41]No, we do not do that here.
[180:16.01]Oops.
[180:18.35]Um...
[180:21.01]I need oil.
[180:21.37]I just need some olive oil.
[180:31.11]Oh, you know what?
[180:31.69]Let's go butter.
[180:32.79]Yeah.
[180:33.31]Let's go butter.
[180:34.25]Hell yeah.
[180:35.47]This is making me want a burger now.
[180:38.42]Clarified butter.
[180:39.28]Oh, my God.
[180:39.64]You've got to be kidding me, dude.
[180:41.32]Oh, man.
[180:42.24]I want a burger now.
[180:43.40]Let's do burgers.
[180:43.92]Okay.
[180:53.24]That's... That's it.
[181:02.54]Okay, that's good.
[181:02.94]Good, good, good.
[181:04.22]Now we're gonna... I'm gonna do... I'm putting in... I need some... Give me that.
[181:10.22]No, not the mayonnaise.
[181:11.85]I don't want the mayo.
[181:12.61]Let's season it really nicely.
[181:20.47]That's good.
[181:20.97]A little bit of salt, too.
[181:23.08]And you know, I'm feeling a little weird today.
[181:27.43]We're going with, what do we want?
[181:31.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[181:32.33]I want like, I want, I want like coriander or something, right?
[181:38.46]So I look, so people think I'm like really smart.
[181:41.62]Oh, what do you put on your burgers?
[181:43.12]Oh, well, it's all pepper, garlic, coriander, cumin, a little bit of thyme.
[181:48.26]Oh, this person really knows what they're doing.
[181:50.18]They understand the kitchen very well.
[181:51.95]Oh, they know what they're doing.
[181:54.23]No, people that say all that shit, they just put it.
[181:56.59]You can't even taste it.
[181:58.66]Like, oh, well, it's a mixture I use of thyme, rosemary, cumin, coriander, cilantro.
[182:04.75]It's like they're just saying those things to make you think that they're like a chef.
[182:08.79]You can't even taste any of that shit.
[182:10.87]It's like it's mac and cheese, dude.
[182:13.39]Like, you can't even taste that.
[182:18.01]It's like you're not going to be able to eat.
[182:19.85]It's going to taste like cheese and pasta.
[182:24.68]What is this?
[182:28.12]What is it?
[182:31.31]Catnip?
[182:32.71]No, no mint.
[182:35.67]I'll do some white pepper.
[182:37.99]And... Lavage!
[182:40.72]Oh, yeah!
[182:41.68]How about some lavage, man?
[182:45.48]No, I want, um... I want, like, onion powder.
[182:47.70]Here we go, garlic powder.
[182:51.60]I'm a big fan of garlic.
[183:04.60]Ooh, I love this shit.
[183:06.98]Alright, I need salt and then I'm ready to grill.
[183:11.54]Ooh, let's use this.
[183:15.71]Where's salt?
[183:18.29]Okay, can you just pretend I put salt on it?
[183:19.67]Who cares?
[183:20.19]Because like, wait, there it is.
[183:22.97]Is this salt or is this like whipped cream?
[183:25.45]What is this?
[183:26.71]Whatever.
[183:30.13]Oh guys, you know what would be so sick right now?
[183:33.87]if I put some truffle powder on it.
[183:37.71]Nobody eats that stuff.
[183:38.91]You eat that when you go to a restaurant.
[183:45.87]Yeah, they go, oh, hey, do you want the truffle this?
[183:47.87]You want the truffle mac?
[183:48.70]You want the truffle fries?
[183:49.58]You want the truffle?
[183:50.48]You just nod your head and go, okay, thanks for the four extra dollars you're going to charge me for these now.
[183:56.52]Are you ready?
[183:58.26]It's time to begin the grilling.
[183:59.96]Oh, we're not using that.
[184:01.24]We're using this.
[184:12.50]Three minutes aside.
[184:13.96]Sometimes after you do three minutes aside, it's very important that you second guess the shit out of yourself over and over again.
[184:21.81]And you do three minutes aside, then you panic.
[184:24.45]And then you squish the fuck out of it because you're terrified of getting sick.
[184:28.77]And then you flip it five more times.
[184:30.66]So it ends up being about six minutes aside.
[184:42.55]What's wrong with this?
[184:46.76]Why is this made of tofu?
[184:51.98]It's not supposed to look like that.
[184:53.60]What's wrong with this?
[184:54.38]I want a new one.
[184:56.74]That's not supposed to look like that.
[185:00.99]That's not supposed to look like that.
[185:03.51]Salt.
[185:09.40]Pepper.
[185:15.64]fish eggs, whatever the fuck this was.
[185:19.93]And, oh, you guys can't forget the garlic powder.
[185:24.51]You can't forget the garlic.
[185:29.85]Okay, now it's ready.
[185:38.74]Now it's ready.
[185:47.59]Now what you're looking for is you're looking for a little sear.
[185:52.01]Three minutes aside.
[185:52.77]Anybody else sit here while this is happening and they freak out?
[186:05.56]You just go like this.
[186:06.42]Oh, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
[186:11.07]And then it starts to smell more than cooked meat.
[186:15.34]It starts to get kind of a different smell and you're like, I don't know if it's supposed to smell like that.
[186:18.78]It's burning.
[186:20.46]And you freak out and flip it in like a minute.
[186:26.54]I'm not a noob.
[186:27.34]Is this on high?
[186:41.61]Perfect.
[186:46.86]Perfect.
[186:52.02]You only seasoned one side.
[186:53.51]Alright, now we squish the fuck out of it!
[187:00.29]Squish it!
[187:03.61]Oh, this looks really good!
[187:16.10]What happened?
[187:16.68]Why is there white powder?
[187:17.96]What the?
[187:22.05]Where did it go?
[187:23.27]Why is there white powder all over it now?
[187:35.05]Oh, don't forget this.
[187:37.63]Don't forget this.
[187:38.39]The weeds from your backyard.
[187:43.49]Whatever that is.
[187:49.11]It's almost ready.
[187:51.31]Oh my God, dude.
[187:53.61]If you could smell that right now.
[187:56.59]Oh my God.
[187:57.65]That smells so good.
[187:59.79]It's just filling the whole house with it.
[188:02.75]Oh man.
[188:03.71]Oh my God.
[188:06.94]It smells so good, dude.
[188:12.06]Are you kidding me?
[188:12.92]It's like an alien meat.
[188:21.20]I'm, oh, mom, are you cooking burgers down there?
[188:23.44]That's right, son.
[188:25.74]Oh, it smells so good down here.
[188:27.26]Alright, that's almost done.
[188:38.74]We got a perfectly cooked medium patty with, I don't know, cocaine on it.
[188:44.46]Set it right there.
[188:46.04]Nice.
[188:46.38]It's like, it's okay.
[188:49.71]A bird shit on it, but I think it's going to be fine.
[188:51.57]It still will taste good.
[188:56.01]What was that?
[188:59.83]What was that?
[189:00.35]What was that?
[189:00.95]What was that?
[189:02.83]What was that?
[189:03.55]Something was flying.
[189:08.95]Alright.
[189:09.71]We got our burger here.
[189:10.81]I want to brush that off.
[189:11.69]I don't know what that is.
[189:13.54]Don't don't forget the grilled onions Shut up I Need a burger patty burger, whatever it is It's that you put starch on it at what I Put your eyes to her starch Andy I'm going fucking I'm being weird I Put some corn
[189:41.79]I'm trying to throw it onto the grill.
[189:44.97]Alright, where... Give me that.
[189:45.99]Hamburger bun.
[189:59.18]Where's burger bun?
[190:05.16]Burger bun?
[190:06.87]A, B?
[190:08.33]Burger meat, burger bun.
[190:15.25]Why is it two tops?
[190:21.02]What?
[190:26.92]Okay, well, whatever.
[190:27.72]It's two tops.
[190:28.54]I don't... I didn't know.
[190:29.34]I don't know why that happened.
[190:30.06]Let's start assembling the burger.
[190:32.17]Remember, this... I'm not kidding.
[190:34.33]This is my favorite burger.
[190:36.05]Or one of them.
[190:38.09]We'll go like this.
[190:38.99]Start here.
[190:41.47]Like that.
[190:47.66]That gets us to, let me make sure I look at you the right way.
[190:51.64]This is a puke-inducing turn.
[190:53.57]I'm so sorry.
[190:55.27]Alright, let's get the onions on there.
[190:56.63]These are grilled onions.
[190:57.33]Dude, I don't even have any cheese.
[191:11.10]What?
[191:18.09]Alright, you get the idea.
[191:19.25]There's the grilled onions.
[191:21.05]I need my lettuce.
[191:23.93]Which is... I don't know where it is.
[191:25.75]This joke is not funny.
[191:28.27]It's just an annoying sound.
[191:30.91]Alright, where's my lettuce?
[191:31.89]It's over here.
[191:32.65]This is the pretend lettuce, right?
[191:37.53]Shit.
[191:38.17]I need to make this over here.
[191:41.53]Grilled onions.
[191:42.48]Lettuce.
[191:42.86]Can I reach it from here?
[191:51.36]You have to pretend this is lettuce.
[191:58.20]Grilled onions and lettuce.
[191:59.04]A little bit of mayo.
[192:01.09]Okay.
[192:09.49]Mayo, lettuce, grilled onions, cheese.
[192:11.29]I don't think I have any cheese here so far.
[192:19.20]A little.
[192:21.08]I mean, I was trying to make it look like it was on there.
[192:24.78]And then cheese.
[192:25.64]Just cheddar cheese.
[192:28.74]Cheddar cheese is fine, although Swiss would be good too.
[192:30.97]So a provolone.
[192:32.29]Oh my god, I want a burger so bad now.
[192:36.37]I'm gonna get the biggest, dirtiest burger you've ever seen in your life.
[192:41.05]Okay, I need to cut this.
[192:50.50]Okay, that's good enough.
[192:54.62]This is the burger right here.
[192:57.14]Again, let's go over it.
[193:02.14]Oh, look at that.
[193:04.20]It's cumin, coriander, thyme, rosemary, baked into the meat, put in beforehand.
[193:14.59]It's got to go into the ground.
[193:15.79]Ground chuck, by the way.
[193:18.42]No, it's grilled onions, lettuce, mayo, cheese, burger patty, medium.
[193:24.01]I don't think you need any more than that.
[193:26.77]Can I cut it down the middle?
[193:30.55]The other one, should I even make the other one?
[193:33.29]Seriously?
[193:43.28]That didn't work.
[193:50.41]You get the idea.
[193:53.49]Alright, the other one, I'm trying to cut it.
[193:56.66]The other one is a little different.
[193:58.34]The other one is grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, provolone cheese, and A1 steak sauce.
[194:05.90]Just pretend like I made that one for you.
[194:10.77]Oh, you can cut it.
[194:18.33]Next game.
[194:18.65]Alright, we're going to move on.
[194:19.47]We'll do the next game.
[194:21.35]Just start.
[194:21.75]Alright.
[194:22.01]Now it's time for the stream.
[194:23.37]You know, the part that everybody thinks is funny.
[194:25.77]Here we go.
[194:26.79]What's he going to do now?
[194:28.19]Oh my God.
[194:29.19]Is he going to put all this stuff in the microwave and cause a fire?
[194:31.71]I actually want to do that.
[194:33.81]Let's hear it.
[194:44.66]Good.
[195:06.63]Will this actually work?
[195:10.86]Alright, if you put something on top of a microwave, will it get cooked, like, radiation style?
[195:24.50]It's working.
[195:35.09]Would this actually work?
[195:37.98]Put the corn in the microwave?
[195:39.02]Oh, that's a good idea.
[195:47.12]Uh, where's the corn?
[195:48.38]Will it pop?
[195:52.02]Oh, it's dirty.
[195:52.86]I gotta... I gotta get, like, just clean it up a little bit.
[196:03.09]Alright, that freaks me out with a microwave, too.
[196:06.46]When you're done and the microwave is, okay, here's your food is ready.
[196:09.75]And the food is ready.
[196:10.71]I hate that.
[196:12.65]There has to be residual like gamma rays in here and shit, right?
[196:17.65]I don't, I want it to sit there for like a good 10 seconds.
[196:27.16]No, no.
[196:30.64]Residual gamma rays.
[196:31.86]I don't know.
[196:32.28]It's like, that feels weird.
[196:34.91]I have talked about this more than a few times.
[196:38.93]We always talk about, okay, like 50 years ago, they thought that smoking cigarettes was healthy, right?
[196:44.89]It was like not a big deal.
[196:46.47]You know, 100 years ago, every 50 to 100 years, we learn something new about humanity that the next like three or four generations look back and say, what the fuck were they doing, right?
[196:59.62]I believe, I think, the microwave is going to be the thing that in a hundred years, people are going to be looking back and going, what were they doing?
[197:09.13]They were zapping their food with radiation?
[197:13.28]What?
[197:13.98]What?
[197:14.64]No, they were not doing that, right?
[197:16.24]Like, it has to be.
[197:20.04]Oh yeah, or plastic.
[197:21.32]Yep, plastic could be another one.
[197:37.44]Definitely plastic.
[197:40.36]Okay, that's good.
[197:41.28]This didn't do anything, by the way.
[197:44.54]I mean, it just turned it like a little orange.
[197:52.79]Alright.
[197:53.11]Bacon in the microwave.
[197:54.17]Yay or nay?
[197:54.85]What do you say?
[197:57.01]Laying raw bacon in the microwave and hitting the button.
[198:00.09]Yay or nay?
[198:05.05]I've seen it done before.
[198:05.91]I'm not a big fan.
[198:14.27]Not a fan.
[198:15.59]Baking it is best.
[198:17.05]You know, I used to really like putting it in the pan, but you can only do a few strips in the pan at a time, and that's a pain in the ass.
[198:25.90]I prefer the taste of strips in the pan versus in the oven, but you can do a whole pound or two pounds of bacon in the oven.
[198:33.52]It takes so long to cook it in a pan.
[198:38.13]Get a griddle, dumbass.
[198:44.28]Alright, let's move on.
[198:45.30]Let's play another game.
[198:47.56]Oh, I just want this.
[198:49.71]I want this right now.
[198:55.93]Oh, wait.
[198:56.45]I forgot to make a fire.
[198:57.65]Okay.
[199:06.24]How do I start a fire?
[199:16.11]Okay.
[199:16.39]Let's turn everything on, right?
[199:32.51]Okay.
[199:48.81]What's that?
[199:49.59]Fried egg shells.
[200:21.33]Alright, let's get that ready.
[200:25.79]Oh, right.
[200:26.33]Okay, this might be loud.
[200:27.79]I would turn your volume down.
[200:29.73]This could be awful.
[200:47.52]Ugh!
[200:50.68]Ugh!
[200:53.44]Oh, I hate this.
[200:55.38]I hate this.
[200:57.41]I'm not even in.
[200:59.23]I hate that.
[201:01.11]Nothing about that is fucking fun.
[201:02.79]Well, that was awful.
[201:05.60]Oh, I just see.
[201:06.86]I just hate that.
[201:08.50]I didn't like that.
[201:30.23]I feel like I'm sanitizing my house.
[201:34.97]No, you don't understand!
[201:35.79]I gotta... Sweeping motions, Jeremy!
[201:42.52]Sweeping motions!
[201:47.54]Put your iPad in the microwave.
[201:56.85]Open!
[201:58.23]Why is this sealed shut?
[202:17.22]I don't like this at all.
[202:18.82]I hate this shit.
[202:20.88]I hate this kind of shit.
[202:21.72]I really do.
[202:22.28]I'm just opening up those snake cans in front of my face.
[202:40.53]How's this doing?
[202:41.15]This is magma.
[202:46.77]Is it on fire?
[203:16.41]Alright, I'm done.
[203:23.44]Wait, what is that?
[203:32.93]What is this?
[204:05.68]This doesn't do anything.
[204:06.44]Alright, next game.
[204:08.26]I'm going to take a break.
[204:09.46]I'm going to get some water.
[204:10.16]I'll be right back.
[204:12.47]I have no idea.
[204:13.11]My face probably looks horrible right now.
[204:16.43]I'm going to take a quick break.
[204:18.57]I'll be right back.
[208:25.27]Hello.
[208:28.09]So now we're going to play Blair Witch VR.
[208:30.23]I said I was going to play this a few weeks ago.
[208:36.35]This is probably the last thing we're going to do.
[208:37.73]So however long I'm going to do this for.
[208:42.68]Somebody said be careful.
[208:43.50]This game is really slow going, but whatever.
[208:46.22]We'll see.
[208:48.88]I do need to untangle my VR.
[208:53.66]Very tangled.
[209:34.16]Alright, we're officially untangled.
[209:36.54]I want to mention this one more time too, because a lot of people are here now.
[209:41.68]So if you watched the replacement stream, the upload on the archive channel has fixed like 90% of all the audio problems.
[209:54.85]So I would say definitely, definitely check it out.
[209:58.69]Any of those like weird, laggy, glitchy moments have been fixed for the most part.
[210:05.47]So I would say, check it out.
[210:08.13]It was the studio recording.
[210:09.25]Thank God.
[210:09.90]All the lag issues we had are pretty much solved.
[210:14.94]Let me untangle this for a second.
[210:16.06]Give me one more minute.
[210:59.06]Okay, you promised us Among Us.
[211:00.92]Among Us VR is not out.
[211:04.32]You guys just gaslit me into saying I was going to play it next time.
[211:11.97]But yeah, I'm really, really, really happy that at least the studio recording came out perfectly fine.
[211:20.79]This is still a few little problems, but if you want to watch it again, those issues should be kind of resolved.
[211:29.08]Alright, let's go.
[211:29.82]Air, which VR, I'm so winded.
[211:34.04]I'm gonna play VR.
[211:37.62]A bunch of bricks on me.
[211:41.36]Headset.
[211:48.20]Talk about microwaves being problematic, but bacon is a carcinogen.
[211:51.79]It's a mush of all the worst parts of the pig.
[211:59.80]I'm not saying it's one's worse than the other.
[212:02.50]What?
[212:09.45]Plus, look, all cooked meat is a carcinogen, right?
[212:13.75]Especially if you grill it.
[212:16.27]That delicious, like, black char stuff?
[212:19.15]That's bad for you.
[212:21.95]I mean, am I going to stop eating that?
[212:23.54]No.
[212:26.42]Have I reduced the amount of meat that I probably consume?
[212:28.84]Probably.
[212:31.27]But I mean, come on.
[212:35.23]I'm not going to stop eating like char broiled bacon bits.
[212:38.06]Alright, here we go.
[212:46.46]Hey, Jerma, is lettuce a liquid?
[212:48.04]No.
[212:52.52]Alright.
[212:57.47]Okay.
[212:58.53]Coming back.
[213:00.44]Where's my mouse?
[213:04.08]Hello?
[213:06.70]I don't know if this... Where's the audio?
[213:09.60]Is there any audio?
[213:14.66]Weird.
[213:21.47]Oh my god, what?
[213:22.73]That scared the shit out of me.
[213:27.05]There's just an animal over here.
[213:34.52]I just saw movement and it was okay.
[213:36.30]Movement type headset, standing mode, free movement.
[213:39.44]Alright.
[213:41.59]I feel like should be hearing some kind of sounds here.
[213:45.83]Hold on.
[213:48.63]Why do we not hear audio?
[213:50.13]Hey, there's audio.
[213:54.26]Hopefully it's not too, too loud.
[214:00.64]Um, hello.
[214:03.41]What happened?
[214:04.05]I just had it.
[214:04.57]What the fuck happened to it?
[214:09.21]Fucking VR.
[214:15.43]What happened to the audio?
[214:16.53]I just had it.
[214:26.17]Where's the audio?
[214:27.23]It was just here.
[214:33.40]Get the fucking audio!
[214:34.61]Click the game window?
[214:39.07]Yeah, I did!
[214:39.67]I can't... It was... I just had it.
[214:53.07]Yeah, this ass is a carcinogen.
[214:58.10]Oh my god.
[214:59.42]Like, one out of every three VR games works.
[215:06.95]Okay, let me try reloading it again.
[215:08.65]I feel like there's better odds at playing roulette than actually getting a VR game to work the way you want it to.
[215:29.20]Yeah, the audio's there.
[215:32.68]Yeah, I got Blair Witch VR down here in my taskbar.
[215:35.91]I clicked it.
[215:37.23]It has clicked right now.
[215:39.94]It has opened up a second... Hold on.
[215:50.68]Why is there even a second window here?
[215:59.41]Yeah, it doesn't want to pull the audio anymore.
[216:02.93]Welcome to fucking hell.
[216:06.21]I'm going to restart the game and see if that does anything.
[216:12.80]Do you know how to work a computer?
[216:16.42]I hate VR.
[216:19.85]I'm literally never playing it again.
[216:20.93]I fucking hate this thing.
[216:32.83]Let me get back into it.
[216:34.17]Let me try to reload the game again.
[216:42.89]You can hear the audio now.
[216:43.86]I'm just going to give this headset away to one of you guys.
[216:51.34]I'm going to sign it.
[216:52.82]I'm going to write, don't fucking ever use this.
[216:56.00]Don't play this.
[217:05.09]only for decoration only as we're going to write on it.
[217:10.45]Okay, so it should be in the window right now.
[217:14.39]Oh my God, I can hear the audio.
[217:21.18]No, don't.
[217:25.98]Oh my fucking God.
[217:27.94]Okay, I need to full screen the window though.
[217:32.46]What the?
[217:34.16]God damn it!
[217:47.83]That- I did the exact same shit last time, didn't do anything.
[217:53.99]Like, the planets have to be in the right spot.
[217:56.04]The Earth has to be the right rotation for VR to work.
[218:07.71]Alright, what do I do?
[218:08.45]Can I pet the dog?
[218:15.30]Who's a good dog?
[218:16.46]Yes, you're a good dog.
[218:18.98]Who's a good dog?
[218:23.48]What is it?
[218:25.88]Okay, uh, standing mode, free movement, comfort, sir, that's fine.
[218:30.58]Video settings, auto-detect.
[218:33.35]Okay.
[218:35.11]New game.
[218:55.55]A Bloober team production?
[219:10.38]Where are we going?
[219:12.24]Welcome to... Burkittsville?
[219:21.29]Did I skip?
[219:22.01]I'm sorry.
[219:22.89]What's with all the cops?
[219:24.99]What's going on?
[219:55.78]I'm missing.
[219:56.88]Peter Shannon.
[219:59.38]Peter Shannon, my son, I'm going to assume, maybe.
[220:01.12]I think.
[220:04.98]Wait, why did this... Oh my god, don't do that.
[220:10.01]It sounds like it's jump cutting.
[220:15.87]Okay.
[220:21.43]Peter?
[220:22.13]Peter?
[220:26.55]Okay, imagine getting something in your eye in VR and it ain't coming out.
[220:30.61]Okay, grab your phone.
[220:32.58]I don't know how to use the phone!
[220:50.02]Good to hear from you.
[220:54.07]to be honest.
[220:55.23]Guess we're both full of surprises.
[220:56.29]So, what are you up to?
[220:59.46]Uh, did you hear about the missing kid?
[221:02.12]Missing kid?
[221:03.66]Oh, wow.
[221:05.46]Okay.
[221:05.78]You think that's a good idea?
[221:10.00]Why wouldn't it be?
[221:13.37]You know why?
[221:14.13]You know what?
[221:17.13]Never mind.
[221:18.21]You're right.
[221:20.66]How do you hang up?
[221:30.40]So I'm out here at a search party to look for a kid?
[221:33.36]Let's go, Bullet.
[221:34.33]Alright, let's go.
[221:42.35]What do we got?
[221:43.33]Let's take a look.
[221:45.15]What do you got?
[221:47.73]Okay, Bullet.
[221:48.47]Let's see.
[221:51.79]Oh, we got a note here.
[221:52.73]We got a note.
[221:56.60]What is this?
[221:57.16]Why would I have this for?
[222:01.40]Alright, what do you got?
[222:02.26]Keep going?
[222:02.58]Alright.
[222:02.76]I gotta find this kid.
[222:25.50]Some items found during the game can be stored in your backpack.
[222:27.84]Okay, cool.
[222:29.82]Oh, that's my backpack.
[222:32.46]What is this?
[222:33.40]My ID?
[222:36.23]What the hell is that?
[222:37.23]Wait, did I just take a sofa?
[222:39.13]What is this, a tent?
[222:43.19]Hey, what are you... Hey, drop it, drop it, drop that.
[222:45.21]Don't touch that.
[222:45.67]Disgusting.
[222:46.45]Disgusting!
[222:52.94]What was the point of that?
[222:55.78]What was the point?
[222:58.38]Oh my!
[223:00.88]That's some strength.
[223:04.24]Okay.
[223:09.52]What was the point of that?
[223:10.52]Let me see, what is this?
[223:13.06]Looking for the missing kid.
[223:14.18]Nine years old, he's four foot four, weighs 68 pounds, okay.
[223:20.18]He was in a green t-shirt.
[223:30.99]Donut, cool.
[223:32.53]Alright, none of this shit matters.
[223:33.45]It's just fluff.
[223:34.25]Let's go.
[223:38.37]What's that?
[223:38.67]A knife?
[223:41.11]What is this?
[223:44.54]You wanna play?
[223:45.06]Try grabbing the whistle.
[223:51.62]Okay, where's the whistle?
[224:08.06]What does this do?
[224:09.36]Snack?
[224:10.96]You want a snack?
[224:18.15]Snack.
[224:21.07]Do I have food for him?
[224:24.49]What?
[224:24.63]What?
[224:30.00]Stay close.
[224:32.00]What the fuck are you talking about?
[224:41.12]That's a really awful way to have that be mapped.
[224:43.24]Alright, let's go.
[224:47.39]You have to blow it?
[224:52.71]What?
[224:58.01]What are you talking about?
[225:00.07]Stay close.
[225:08.42]You were wrong.
[225:15.74]Come on, boy.
[225:17.32]Let's go find this kid.
[225:35.64]Stop saying gamer posture.
[225:51.45]Scary.
[225:52.37]Blair Witch.
[225:56.45]Be careful.
[225:57.51]She's gonna come get you.
[225:59.85]In the woods.
[226:02.70]Chapter 1, Into the Woods.
[226:09.66]Machine gun fire?
[226:13.94]The dog better not die.
[226:15.52]I know, right, it's... I don't want that to happen either.
[226:21.18]Okay.
[226:24.64]I don't know why he keeps doing this.
[226:26.00]Okay.
[226:36.95]Stay close.
[226:40.08]Do I have to press A or something?
[226:48.04]Is that- Is it- Stay close, just- During the game, you can try to communicate using the walkie-talkie, okay?
[226:56.23]Walkie-talkie.
[227:00.73]Okay.
[227:01.35]Where's the walkie-talkie?
[227:02.45]Up here?
[227:04.27]That's my whistle!
[227:06.49]What the f- fuck?
[227:08.19]Where is it?! !
[227:10.11]Pull it.
[227:17.96]Ellis to base.
[227:18.60]Did you copy?
[227:20.92]Ellis, what are you doing out here?
[227:23.96]Joining the search party.
[227:26.28]Ellis, if you think you've got some obligation to be here, you don't.
[227:31.72]I mean, I know it's his brother and all.
[227:34.26]Is there a sprint?
[227:36.52]I'm here to help.
[227:37.72]That's all there is to it.
[227:40.94]If he catches the scent, he'll lead us straight to the kid.
[227:44.02]You got a point there.
[227:46.28]You think you're up for it?
[227:47.44]Your health issues, they're not going to be a problem?
[227:53.29]Sir, I'm not going to screw this up.
[227:56.27]Not this time.
[227:58.59]Well, alright then.
[228:00.55]Just stay in the rear.
[228:02.01]Make sure we haven't missed anything.
[228:04.17]Roger that.
[228:05.29]Over and out.
[228:08.41]Okay.
[228:09.75]Oh, he's got something.
[228:17.11]What'd you find?
[228:17.55]Bullet?
[228:20.43]Did you find a trace of anything?
[228:23.87]What do you got?
[228:24.53]What's in here?
[228:24.97]Oh, look.
[228:25.27]Another missing persons thing.
[228:26.67]Okay.
[228:27.63]Okay.
[228:38.64]Night in the woods.
[228:40.26]Just like old times, huh?
[228:42.38]What, the students?
[228:43.94]I sure as hell hope not.
[228:45.98]We had twice the manpower back then.
[228:52.16]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[228:53.40]This will be different.
[228:55.29]Yeah, I hope you're right.
[228:57.17]Over and out.
[228:59.51]Yes, this is the Blair Witch.
[229:05.11]Ooh!
[229:06.17]The world's not your goddamn trash can.
[229:12.69]What do you got?
[229:14.99]Where are you?
[229:15.47]Oh, what do you got?
[229:19.13]Something?
[229:22.18]Oh my god, it's something.
[229:23.78]I think there's a body in here.
[229:24.94]What is it?
[229:25.32]Oh, I thought it was...
[229:44.42]Can I see it?
[229:45.60]Let me see it.
[229:46.64]The Boston Red Sox.
[229:47.91]Okay, I got... Alright, just follow the scent.
[229:53.17]Come here.
[229:55.79]Why is the game... What's happening with the game?
[230:01.37]Why is the game so dark?
[230:03.38]Can you smell?
[230:09.26]He's got it.
[230:10.52]Okay, hold on.
[230:10.96]I need...
[230:15.05]Wait, where'd he go?
[230:20.01]Bullet!
[230:24.34]Heal!
[230:28.60]Alright, where is it?
[230:33.48]Is there a sprint?
[230:34.24]There has to be.
[230:37.62]Where'd he go?
[230:42.79]Bullet, wait up!
[230:43.70]Don't go through this tall brush.
[230:48.44]What happened?
[230:58.65]Excuse me?
[231:07.59]What happened?
[231:10.01]I don't... What just happened to me?
[231:18.09]I can't call him.
[231:19.05]Did somebody shoot an arrow at me?
[231:21.17]An arrow just went by my head.
[231:24.89]What happened?
[231:42.50]What's going on?
[231:42.94]Why is the sun so bright?
[231:48.48]What's going on?
[231:48.88]What?
[231:53.73]That was weird.
[232:09.86]Prolonged loneliness can affect your mental state.
[232:14.64]Prolonged loneliness?
[232:18.44]Um, okay.
[232:22.32]Well, don't run away.
[232:23.02]Hold on.
[232:23.38]Come back here.
[232:26.56]Alright, stay close.
[232:35.43]Ooh, that's an itchy spot.
[232:38.17]Okay, now what?
[232:39.86]Where are we going now?
[232:51.13]Okay.
[232:52.23]I guess we're going to go this way.
[232:58.13]Where is that?
[233:00.97]No, I want to answer the phone, not button the person.
[233:04.49]Can I call that person back?
[233:11.04]Is that a... What is... Is that a picture?
[233:12.83]Oh, come on.
[233:21.87]Really?
[233:28.26]Good night, Jerma and Chat.
[233:33.24]Stay over here with me.
[233:35.82]Well, good night.
[233:36.85]Thanks for watching.
[233:37.47]Thanks for hanging out.
[233:39.43]Oh, a few things to talk about real quick.
[233:42.34]I'm going to be streaming on Saturday and Sunday this week.
[233:45.26]Sunday, Ster and I are going to play Dying Light 2.
[233:47.10]Going to go back to normal, back to the regularly scheduled programming.
[233:50.96]I'm not sure what we're going to do Saturday, but we'll figure that out.
[233:59.67]That's the plan for this week.
[234:01.73]So I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[234:03.07]End of the stream voice?
[234:03.97]No, not quite.
[234:05.01]Not quite.
[234:05.39]Not until I get scared at least once.
[234:10.42]This dog looks like Scooby Doo.
[234:25.78]Every video game, I win!
[234:33.11]Why am I yelling?
[234:37.59]Every time I play VR, I just talk so much louder than normal.
[234:52.25]Bullet, stay close.
[234:53.91]Bullet, stay close to me.
[234:58.17]There's a tent over there, Bullet.
[234:59.71]There's a tent.
[235:05.11]Is that a campsite?
[235:07.61]It is.
[235:09.57]Oh, no.
[235:12.71]Oh, no.
[235:13.53]Yeah, I think it still works.
[235:22.33]What?
[235:25.12]Ellis, maybe you should... No, I'm fine.
[235:28.48]I'll deal with it.
[235:29.52]I just need a little more time.
[235:32.00]Why does she have a blurred out face?
[235:33.37]Ellis, what you need is help.
[235:36.67]I could have managed.
[235:40.17]Ellis, I can't do this anymore.
[235:42.98]What?
[235:43.70]What is it this time?
[235:44.87]What, I wasn't smiling enough?
[235:46.31]Didn't say I love you for five fucking minutes?
[235:48.65]Jesus Christ, Ellis.
[235:49.99]Do you even hear yourself?
[235:51.29]Yeah, I can hear myself just fine.
[235:53.27]And I can see the way you look at me.
[235:54.91]Like I'm a fucking loser.
[235:56.31]Like a sick little puppy for you to look after.
[235:57.97]Oh, hi, Ellis.
[236:02.80]Get over yourself, Ellis.
[236:04.66]Be a man for once.
[236:05.88]This is like Silent Hill.
[236:06.70]There it is.
[236:07.90]There it is.
[236:12.33]I'm getting all this from looking at the camcorder?
[236:14.65]Jesus.
[236:14.91]Incoming call.
[236:46.74]What did I do?
[236:50.58]What am I doing?
[236:51.60]Come on, be a man.
[237:00.60]Alex, you got my message.
[237:03.49]You, uh, wanted to see me, sir?
[237:06.11]Better yet.
[237:07.25]I want to introduce you to someone.
[237:08.95]Bullet, meet your new partner.
[237:11.35]He's been through a lot, just like you.
[237:13.41]What?
[237:14.41]Sir, I can't.
[237:15.83]Oh, you got something else going on right now?
[237:17.23]Is he a puppy?
[237:18.17]Just take the damn dog, Ellis.
[237:20.65]Yes, sir.
[237:32.21]It's Otto.
[237:34.91]We're already at chapter three?
[237:36.45]I feel like this is going way too, wait, chapter three.
[237:42.81]Are there 45 chapters in this game?
[237:44.87]I'm speedrunning.
[237:55.09]Oh, we're inside the tent.
[238:03.12]Don't, boy!
[238:04.08]Jesus.
[238:06.46]Oh, no, where is it?
[238:08.98]Bullet!
[238:10.52]Bullet, where did it go?
[238:14.28]Where is it?
[238:14.72]Bullet, where'd that just go?
[238:17.24]You just had it.
[238:18.04]Bullet, where is it?
[238:18.80]Oh, shit.
[238:19.02]Wait, I don't have to do this again?
[238:20.94]Red tapes allow you to manipulate reality.
[238:44.93]Wait, what's going on?
[238:45.65]Okay, so there was a- something happened here.
[238:47.31]I can rewind?
[238:47.79]Okay, so what do I do now?
[238:48.83]Okay, that's fun.
[238:49.23]I need that flashlight.
[239:14.36]Thank God.
[239:14.84]Alright.
[239:16.64]Thanks a lot, Bullet.
[239:17.81]Appreciate it.
[239:20.95]What is this?
[239:21.37]Paintbrush?
[239:24.79]Okay.
[239:25.59]Ooh!
[239:32.59]Hamburger Helper.
[239:35.37]Oh, that looks like a fucking gross omelet.
[239:37.37]A few days old?
[239:45.48]Alright, let's go.
[239:46.02]I think I have to go over here.
[239:48.92]What does this say?
[239:56.97]Alright, you go first.
[240:03.77]Did I get everything?
[240:09.43]What's over there?
[240:09.89]Ooh, a note!
[240:11.47]A note!
[240:11.89]There's a note on the ground!
[240:12.71]A note on the ground!
[240:25.79]What?
[240:28.05]What is it?
[240:32.63]What is it?
[240:32.95]So, dog, these are leaves.
[240:44.88]Can I start a fire?
[240:51.66]Oh, a big, juicy, double cheeseburger sounds like it's gonna be perfect.
[240:56.44]Don't you... Don't you agree?
[241:02.36]I'm gonna... Oh, I can't wait.
[241:10.33]Oh, hey, is Lost Ark any good?
[241:12.05]Should I play it?
[241:12.95]I need some opinions.
[241:13.69]I need some outside opinions. ...
[241:22.13]No.
[241:23.13]Fuck that.
[241:24.75]No.
[241:26.75]Why somebody knows?
[241:27.39]Okay, that game got announced.
[241:31.83]I remember... I remember sitting, I think, in a call with, like, Ster and MLC_St3alth in, like, 2012 or something.
[241:41.42]And it was like, oh, wow, this is gonna be so much fun.
[241:43.40]It's like a Diablo-esque, like, MMO.
[241:46.98]Then 10 years later, I guess it's like out now somehow?
[241:49.56]It came out like four years ago in like Korea or something?
[241:53.12]What's going on here?
[241:57.46]What do we do about this?
[241:59.58]I'm not gonna put my fucking hand in there.
[242:01.10]Is that gonna do anything?
[242:05.35]You just clasped around me.
[242:08.53]What's wrong?
[242:11.19]Why is the dog freaking out?
[242:18.04]I don't know what's here.
[242:19.18]What's wrong?
[242:27.47]You guys... Okay, so I've never seen any of the Blair Witch movies.
[242:33.85]None of them.
[242:35.83]Does a Blair Witch ever come out on screen and is like...
[242:41.11]Is there, like, an actual Blair witch, like, old lady that is, like, walking around and being like, I'm scary!
[242:47.51]Does that happen?
[242:51.66]What's that?
[242:59.08]Okay.
[243:01.28]Where's my flashlight?
[243:03.95]Where's my flashlight?
[243:04.81]Where's my flashlight?
[243:06.29]Where's my flashlight?
[243:08.11]What is this?
[243:13.15]Should I record?
[243:21.93]HEY!
[243:24.05]HEY!
[243:24.65]HEY!
[243:28.83]Okay, relax.
[243:30.78]What even was that?
[243:33.38]I need my flashlight.
[243:39.64]I would be so bad in a scenario like this.
[243:44.66]Everybody be quiet.
[243:45.64]There's a monster out there that's going to kill us.
[243:48.34]Hey!
[243:48.58]Hey!
[243:49.42]What is it?
[243:51.10]What's happening?
[243:51.58]Hey!
[243:51.94]I hate when people do that.
[244:00.13]I'm supposed to just wear a t-shirt that's just a white t-shirt with just black print on it that says free food on it with an arrow pointing up to my face.
[244:15.40]Like flip-flops, because I ain't going to be able to run around in those.
[244:17.78]I can't.
[244:28.75]An arrow pointing... An arrow... I'm not even going to say it.
[244:44.26]Alright, come on dog, let's go.
[244:56.53]What?
[244:56.77]Okay, in what part of the world are we in?
[244:59.12]This is like Jurassic Park leaves.
[245:02.54]What looks like that and where are we?
[245:04.36]Wait, we did a full circle?
[245:16.21]Yeah, alright.
[245:16.59]Should I put the... Should I cook something?
[245:20.55]What do I got?
[245:22.96]Trash items?
[245:32.46]Wooden dolls.
[245:34.62]Key items.
[245:37.12]What should I do?
[245:39.98]Should I start, like, a fire?
[245:51.96]I don't understand.
[245:57.08]What about in the actual tent?
[246:06.82]Should I do the camera?
[246:15.76]What?
[246:16.04]Why is that happening?
[246:24.65]Toy car.
[246:25.57]Cool.
[246:25.71]I got- What?
[246:27.64]What's wrong?
[246:28.12]What?
[246:28.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[246:30.40]I need my flashlight.
[246:32.10]Where's my flashlight?
[246:33.04]There's so much junk in my pack.
[246:36.62]Okay.
[246:36.86]Where's it- Where'd it go?
[246:55.78]Hold the flashlight in your hand!
[247:00.73]Where are you?
[247:04.51]I'm not- Don't go that far!
[247:05.77]I'm not fast enough!
[247:06.60]Come back!
[247:08.32]Back!
[247:10.14]I don't- I don't know where you're going.
[247:31.88]Remember, you're lost in the hills.
[247:42.10]Huh?
[247:42.18]Did I spin around?
[247:44.53]Where's the dog?
[247:49.61]Did I do a complete U-turn here?
[247:51.41]There he is.
[247:52.13]There he is.
[247:58.77]Okay, let's go.
[248:01.37]It's gotten blue.
[248:10.48]I want the- I want- No, I want the- No, stop doing that.
[248:13.92]I want the camcorder.
[248:16.82]No, I want the camcorder!
[248:19.08]Where's the camcorder on my body?
[248:24.18]What is this?
[248:31.64]Dude, wait, what the hell?
[248:39.10]Where's the camera?
[248:39.70]I want to get this on film.
[248:57.31]We're doing a whole lot of walking here.
[249:16.16]Okay.
[249:18.48]Chapter 4.
[249:22.43]Each chapter is a paragraph in this book.
[249:29.31]The frames are dropping?
[249:33.31]I wonder... I don't think it's my computer.
[249:36.31]Maybe the internet's messed up?
[249:45.06]How bad is it?
[249:56.79]When you take the camera out, they drop.
[249:59.20]It's probably some weird problem with the game.
[250:02.70]It's not my computer.
[250:03.44]I've got a 3090.
[250:04.06]Okay, here we go.
[250:06.90]Time to get scared, right?
[250:10.04]Chapter 5.
[250:11.12]Jump scares.
[250:16.06]Chapter 6.
[250:16.68]Here comes the monster.
[250:19.38]Chapter seven, home.
[250:39.63]Hey, hey, hey, too far, too far.
[250:42.95]Too far, I heard a splash.
[250:50.60]Okay, is this just an elaborate Slenderman?
[250:53.08]Because I've gotten two of these.
[251:02.31]Okay, I have two notes now.
[251:06.73]Is Slenderman going to come show up in the woods?
[251:14.85]Dog?
[251:17.12]Dog, I need you.
[251:21.20]Okay, stay with me.
[251:24.20]Okay, where are we going?
[251:28.26]Sorry I'm shining that in your eyes.
[251:29.84]This way?
[251:39.39]Don't even think about it, game.
[251:43.15]What?
[251:58.08]I'm just waiting to see Snape's Patronus just walk by.
[252:11.83]Don't touch that.
[252:19.48]Don't touch it, right?
[252:20.38]Should I touch it?
[252:20.86]What is that?
[252:24.91]Wait, use the camera, use the reality shifting camera.
[252:49.67]That didn't do anything.
[253:01.68]Why?
[253:02.08]Why?
[253:04.73]That was... That was dumb.
[253:08.67]And I'll tell you why.
[253:10.59]The reason why that was stupid is because that filled up the entire screen.
[253:17.79]It didn't like pop out right here.
[253:19.97]It wasn't like a little thing that was right in front of me.
[253:22.40]That filled up every square inch of my view.
[253:26.38]Somebody actually just flashed my face with a red light.
[253:32.33]Come on.
[253:36.73]You got scared by cooking simulator.
[253:38.73]I don't like gas, okay?
[253:42.02]And I'm going to be very upfront with you right now.
[253:44.42]If I had to choose between taking a propane tank and putting it in an oven versus running around in the woods with your dog and touch a tree, I'm picking this one.
[253:56.08]I hate condensed, compressed gas.
[254:00.44]It's one of my biggest fears.
[254:01.89]It really is.
[254:03.57]I don't like ovens.
[254:04.95]I don't like small contained spaces that are like a foot by a foot that have all this pressure built up inside of it.
[254:12.45]The thing's ready to blow at any moment's notice.
[254:16.21]No.
[254:17.69]See, this shit doesn't scare me.
[254:20.41]Like, I mean, I would be terrified here.
[254:29.02]this doesn't scare me the way that a compressed gas in a container does is it a person I think we found the ravine you were talking about any updates on your side yeah actually you know if anyone's ever done any construction work out here like what like the oven concrete foundations or uh trenches
[254:56.08]Zero idea how ovens work.
[254:59.20]I know how an oven works.
[255:01.06]It's- I don't like it.
[255:04.26]I don't like gas.
[255:22.30]Okay, you can't tell me.
[255:23.78]I know we all know that it's safe.
[255:25.16]We all know that it's fine.
[255:26.89]Everything's fine.
[255:27.69]But if just pull yourself out of the world for a second and look down at the world and think of a propane tank, what is going on in there?
[255:35.95]Think of like just a propane tank.
[255:39.13]If you stop thinking about like, oh, it's so safe.
[255:41.14]It's scientific, right?
[255:43.54]It's kind of fucking terrifying.
[255:47.68]It's this tank that somehow is holding
[255:51.33]Like pounds and pounds of pressure inside.
[255:53.89]That if it decides to, if you heat it up or you hit it, or if too much pressure builds up, the thing explodes.
[256:05.28]Guess we're not going to find out.
[256:07.02]Oh my God.
[256:07.68]What the hell am I supposed to do about this?
[256:11.62]Locked.
[256:12.90]I can't, there's only like four combinations this could be.
[256:32.14]Locked.
[256:39.76]Dermot creates a fire and cooks over it?
[256:42.60]Yeah, I'm not- fire is fine.
[256:44.52]Fire is not trapped inside.
[256:50.39]Fire is not trapped inside of a container.
[256:55.63]You know, it's like all the warning labels, too.
[256:57.77]Like fire, you know fire's warning label?
[257:00.53]It burns out.
[257:01.90]Be careful.
[257:03.28]Propane tanks have this, like, huge, gigantic, like, just don't fucking touch it.
[257:07.98]Don't go near it.
[257:08.90]Look at all the warnings, the big red labels all over it.
[257:11.18]Be careful.
[257:11.54]This is going to explode.
[257:13.15]Like fire is just like it's going to burn, and it's going to burn.
[257:14.95]It's going to hurt you.
[257:15.43]It hurts.
[257:15.73]It's burning.
[257:17.49]I don't like it.
[257:18.57]I don't.
[257:26.38]Yeah, and I know I just described the same warnings that are on the side of a public pool, right?
[257:32.78]Like, don't dive.
[257:33.80]Watch that you're going to break your neck.
[257:35.02]Don't do anything crazy.
[257:35.68]Don't do anything stupid.
[257:36.32]It's too deep.
[257:37.22]I know that, like, all these warning labels.
[257:43.72]I'm just saying.
[257:47.81]Are you afraid of humans?
[257:52.35]Most of all.
[258:04.16]Yep.
[258:08.62]Empty truck.
[258:12.29]Dude, Elden Ring comes out in like 14 days or something, right?
[258:17.41]Are you kidding me?
[258:18.71]What's that?
[258:20.11]Toothpaste?
[258:20.59]The door just opened.
[258:34.14]What do you got?
[258:36.14]Don't... You're... There's a ghost in here.
[258:41.54]What?
[258:44.56]What's that?
[258:47.01]Another tape?
[258:47.59]Ooh, a tape!
[258:49.93]Let's see.
[258:58.65]Wait, is that?
[259:01.73]It's Peter.
[259:02.29]I think I didn't see that, Peter.
[259:04.67]Ballsy move, kid.
[259:05.98]Is that me talking?
[259:10.76]Let's call Lanning.
[259:14.40]Ellis to base.
[259:15.58]Peter didn't run away.
[259:16.74]He was kidnapped.
[259:17.86]I found a tape.
[259:19.18]It shows the man who did it.
[259:20.70]Me.
[259:21.12]What?
[259:22.06]How did... Wait, a tape?
[259:24.34]In the middle of the forest?
[259:26.10]Ellis, are you serious?
[259:28.09]This sounds like the guy from Trailer Park Boys.
[259:30.27]Ricky, you're a fucking idiot.
[259:54.71]What's his name?
[259:55.21]He was shot in those trenches I saw earlier.
[259:58.73]What's his name?
[259:59.39]Come on, Bullet.
[260:01.03]Leahy, yeah.
[260:01.65]Alright, let's keep going, man.
[260:06.17]Let's go.
[260:10.61]Gotta find that kid.
[260:23.79]What?
[260:26.14]What?
[260:27.08]What?
[260:29.57]What?
[260:31.09]What?
[260:32.71]What?
[260:39.85]Back here again.
[260:40.47]Okay.
[260:42.61]So I gotta do something with the car.
[260:44.97]I gotta film the car.
[260:48.75]The doors keep opening and closing.
[260:51.75]What's that?
[260:52.27]What's going on up there?
[260:54.05]Did I film the car?
[260:57.73]Otto!
[261:00.15]What's that?
[261:00.97]That's the tree, right?
[261:06.48]Hey, can you find some?
[261:07.32]Can you find some?
[261:09.04]Play Snake on the phone.
[261:21.76]What?
[261:25.64]It's hard to, okay.
[261:27.06]I love these controllers, but sometimes it's hard to grip and press buttons at the same time.
[261:32.23]Oh, cool.
[261:48.68]Let's go.
[261:54.96]It's so hard to see this.
[261:59.32]Did I go through the wall?
[262:07.88]This is taking so much to even see this.
[262:09.48]I feel like I'm shit-faced right now.
[262:12.77]Just leaning in, closing one eye, looking at the phone.
[262:16.03]I feel like I am trashed.
[262:31.51]I'm going to get jump scared, right?
[262:32.83]That's how this becomes funny.
[262:48.74]I can't see.
[262:52.88]What a boring stream this is right here.
[262:57.82]I can do this on my own, with my own phone.
[263:01.65]Right?
[263:02.45]Or maybe not even... Index controllers.
[263:06.79]You just fucked up my whole game.
[263:13.55]Hope everything's going well, call me when you have a minute.
[263:20.54]Alright, come on.
[263:23.40]What do I need to do here?
[263:29.13]You bought the index.
[263:30.33]The index is the best one.
[263:31.60]Now, I don't care how many times they show the commercial of like the people in the living room like dancing with their fucking wireless.
[263:41.60]No, this is the best one.
[263:47.51]And yes, it's a thousand dollars.
[263:49.57]Okay, whatever it is.
[263:51.83]Nobody has that much fun in VR.
[263:53.63]No one does.
[264:01.18]It's nice to not have wires, though.
[264:04.12]I know.
[264:04.86]And it's probably awesome.
[264:06.36]But you know what?
[264:07.26]I'm going to stick with my purchase.
[264:10.46]Give me the camera.
[264:13.44]What am I supposed to do?
[264:19.92]Something to do with the truck.
[264:21.80]Has to be.
[264:25.84]Person?
[264:26.46]No.
[264:27.38]I need to figure out what the combination of that lock is.
[264:35.62]You've nice butt crack, what?
[264:39.40]Shut up.
[264:46.14]Millionaire can't afford a Quest 2.
[264:49.84]I already bought, guys, I have a... I'm not gonna buy the PS4 four times.
[265:01.06]I have a Vive that is in a box in my closet.
[265:06.06]I now own an index.
[265:07.82]You want me to buy a quest?
[265:11.74]I'm the sucker at that point.
[265:13.14]Do you understand?
[265:17.48]I'm not going to buy a $800 GTA V again.
[265:23.74]I'm not going to buy the... I have it already.
[265:26.58]The video was shot around here somewhere.
[265:36.45]Where is it?
[265:36.75]Right here?
[265:39.63]Oh!
[265:40.05]What is it?
[265:43.71]Oh!
[265:46.81]What?
[265:48.65]What is it?
[265:48.97]Where is it?
[265:49.27]The video was shot around here somewhere.
[266:03.78]Come on.
[266:04.16]Where is it?
[266:06.96]Let's see it.
[266:07.44]Where?
[266:12.50]Bullet, wait.
[266:15.14]Bullet, wait.
[266:27.07]Play the tape.
[266:39.98]It's right here.
[266:41.66]Okay.
[266:45.76]So it's facing this way.
[266:51.56]He's going, hey, hey, ballsy move, kid.
[266:54.06]Right here.
[267:01.53]Okay, is there a rock?
[267:05.45]Was there a rock?
[267:15.50]Just guessed the code.
[267:21.48]It's gotta be a rock on the ground, right?
[267:23.36]It's like, hey, there's a ballsy move, Peter.
[267:26.20]Right here.
[267:41.13]What is that?
[267:48.05]What's happening?
[267:50.43]I swear he played something like this before.
[267:51.99]Yeah, Outlast.
[267:54.47]Brute force, please.
[267:57.75]Play the tape forward.
[268:02.12]Buy me a what?
[268:06.08]Stop saying Peter and help me with this fucking video game.
[268:09.82]Stop.
[268:10.36]It's half of the chat.
[268:12.77]All I see is butt cracking Peter.
[268:15.21]Help me.
[268:19.74]You guys got over that a year or two ago as well.
[268:23.97]It went so fast.
[268:25.09]Everyone would always say, Peter.
[268:29.83]Call 911 on your phone?
[268:33.13]You need to go back.
[268:35.29]Find the rock.
[268:36.01]Yep, yep, yep.
[268:36.83]Find the rock.
[268:38.13]Play the tape.
[268:48.34]Alright, tree falls in the forest.
[268:51.22]There's Peter.
[268:54.30]Ah!
[268:54.44]What's going on?
[269:06.67]Okay.
[269:07.93]Is he peeing?
[269:14.50]If the tree falls and nobody's around...
[269:17.90]Call Peter.
[269:19.10]Press right trigger to enter one.
[269:35.75]The tree?
[269:39.25]Buttcrack Peter is the code.
[269:41.13]Press left trigger to enter...
[269:49.88]To enter pregnancy mode.
[269:52.50]Okay.
[269:58.27]What?
[269:59.07]Like, oh yeah, dude, just press the left trigger.
[270:06.83]What would that mode even entail?
[270:08.78]What are you talking about?
[270:11.72]I'm going to have to look up the answer.
[270:19.74]Why is he so bad at this?
[270:20.72]I don't, I don't know what the game wants me to do.
[270:26.08]I guess I'm gonna go this way.
[270:35.65]Press A and B. No, this, the tree fell.
[270:40.05]We just told you the answer.
[270:41.55]Press left trigger.
[270:42.75]Do your tummy dance.
[270:44.99]Look down at the ground.
[270:46.21]Remember the code is in the truck.
[270:54.76]Rewind them.
[270:55.54]The only way to get out of this is to go back and try appearing offline.
[270:59.90]Use the camera.
[271:01.16]The dog might find with the stuff.
[271:03.67]Left trigger, press A and B. Look behind you.
[271:14.25]Where is this rock that I pick up?
[271:16.17]Why would they show that?
[271:29.82]What the hell?
[271:34.95]Play the tape while looking down at the ground.
[271:36.73]Oh!
[271:42.87]I think I didn't see that, Peter.
[271:51.74]Ballsy move, kid.
[271:53.06]Wait, where'd it go?
[272:00.68]Pause it!
[272:09.25]There it is.
[272:10.75]What the hell is this game?
[272:15.25]Alright, find him!
[272:16.75]Alright, we're moving, we're moving, we're moving, we're moving, we're moving, we're moving!
[272:23.58]We're moving!
[272:38.71]What you got, something?
[272:48.14]Weren't we already here?
[272:56.38]We just, we already did, we didn't find him at all.
[273:03.97]What the hell?
[273:06.11]You sniffed the baseball and then you brought us back to the truck?
[273:12.30]What?
[273:57.44]Where's the, it didn't fall.
[274:06.48]What the hell?
[274:07.12]This is gonna make a sick vlog.
[274:16.45]Your dog needs more strength.
[274:20.01]I beg you, press left trigger.
[274:21.45]The code is in the truck.
[274:29.21]Where do you see a code?
[274:39.91]I don't see a code.
[274:46.99]You just lied to me.
[274:47.69]That's alright.
[274:53.25]Honk the horn?
[275:00.95]Get the truck in the same view with the tape.
[275:03.75]The problem is it's hard to see what's on that tape.
[275:09.82]You see, I've got a complaint.
[275:12.18]Here's my complaint.
[275:15.34]Like, VR is kind of hard to see anyways.
[275:19.02]Your vision is kind of distorted in a way anyways.
[275:22.10]But, like, having to look at a video inside of VR, like, it's almost impossible to make out what's going on here.
[275:32.05]It's hard to tell.
[275:34.01]What even am I watching here?
[275:36.71]Like, what is that?
[275:38.31]It's hard to even see what that is.
[275:40.93]That's a tree falling, but what's underneath that?
[275:46.20]What the hell is that?
[275:52.62]What is that thing?
[275:53.42]It's like a campfire?
[275:55.52]Campsite?
[276:00.27]He really does hate VR.
[276:07.79]Use the x-ray function?
[276:20.48]X-ray on the truck?
[276:35.12]I don't see anything here.
[276:38.00]I got nothing here.
[276:42.58]Use the... Can we get a diaper cam?
[276:44.71]Give the dog the camera for fuck's sake.
[276:46.53]Put the camera down here.
[276:47.41]You have to time it right.
[276:50.61]Collect all eight.
[276:51.49]Pause it when the tree falls.
[277:02.96]I can't even see.
[277:04.16]What am I even looking for?
[277:05.78]Is that it?
[277:13.15]No, it's too thin.
[277:19.57]He's doing this on purpose.
[277:22.37]I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[277:25.74]Line it up.
[277:26.46]Stop looking at chat and use your tiny brain.
[277:30.94]The...
[277:34.66]I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[277:36.58]I don't know what that is.
[277:38.16]Because I, you see on your screen, I've got like 480p in both eyes.
[277:44.02]And then this is blurred to shit.
[277:46.24]What is that?
[277:48.60]Is that a bench?
[277:50.69]I can't, it's blurred out.
[277:52.91]I can't see what this is.
[277:57.37]It looks like a hot bench.
[277:59.53]It's like a bench that has like fire on it.
[278:03.94]That's the truck?
[278:13.03]That's not the truck!
[278:19.99]What fucking tree is that?
[278:24.08]It's from behind the truck?
[278:59.22]I don't, guys, I don't think that's the truck.
[279:03.03]It's the right side of the truck?
[279:10.75]Wouldn't it be showing up at this point though, seriously?
[279:14.29]It's not the right side of the truck.
[279:29.52]I don't think this is where I need to be.
[279:33.06]Go back to the baby.
[279:38.13]Have you gotten to the dog upgrade?
[279:39.75]The chat's going too fast.
[279:42.15]You're reaching abandoned?
[279:43.17]Give the dog the baseball scent again.
[279:52.12]Come here.
[279:53.86]Where is this?
[279:57.76]Where...
[279:58.89]Take a look.
[279:59.39]What do you think?
[279:59.81]What do you got?
[280:02.05]What do you got for us?
[280:02.65]Anything?
[280:05.11]No?
[280:06.43]He doesn't want to do it.
[280:11.86]Proceed.
[280:15.68]Just, okay, please everybody spam that copypasta, please.
[280:20.34]That's the only thing I want to see in the chat because I need to read it one word at a time.
[280:29.60]There's a fallen tree that you saw.
[280:32.46]The abandoned.
[280:34.84]Unfortunately.
[280:37.06]There's a fallen tree.
[280:38.95]Pause the recording.
[280:39.61]There's a fallen tree.
[280:42.27]Rain.
[280:44.23]There's a fall- I can't!
[280:46.41]I'm coming out.
[280:47.77]I'm coming out.
[280:48.35]I need to read this.
[280:52.05]What does it say?
[280:55.76]There's a fallen tree that you saw at the beginning of the last recording.
[280:58.80]Play it and pause the recording when the tree is still standing.
[281:00.82]Unfortunately, you will find out that the bridge behind the tree has been destroyed.
[281:04.68]Thus, you have to go back to the starting point.
[281:08.70]There's a fallen tree that you saw at the beginning of the recording.
[281:11.48]Play it and pause the recording when the tree is still standing.
[281:14.96]Where's the tree?
[281:18.72]You will find an abandoned small gauge train.
[281:22.50]What train?
[281:26.37]We haven't seen a train?
[281:27.56]Okay.
[281:38.04]I'm going to apparently look for a train.
[281:42.11]We're going to find a train.
[281:51.51]Okay.
[281:51.99]I'm leaving this goddamn area.
[282:00.25]The sound is gone again.
[282:17.39]He's in training mode.
[282:19.87]Okay.
[282:23.93]Okay, I'm ready.
[282:29.74]Excuse me, I can't see with my glasses.
[282:31.62]The whole thing is pitch black.
[282:34.90]Go find the tree.
[282:36.38]Oh, Sonny, I don't know where my glasses are.
[282:38.90]It's blurry in VR.
[282:40.18]But, you know, at least we have one fucking ounce of light.
[282:43.51]Oh, good thing I can see where the tree is.
[282:46.99]Find a tree.
[282:47.95]I think it could be this one.
[283:12.11]Okay, so... It's not this one.
[283:16.61]There ain't been no train, guys, okay?
[283:20.29]There hasn't been a single solitary choo-choo train the whole time we've been playing.
[283:26.74]That tree does not fall.
[283:29.06]Where is this train?
[283:30.22]You'll find an abandoned train.
[283:31.58]And where am I supposed to find the... I'm just gonna do 2-1-1 for you, because that's what people said.
[283:34.88]I don't even care.
[283:36.34]Just hurry up.
[283:36.92]Just go.
[283:42.20]Tree, not train.
[283:43.42]What?
[283:45.47]2113.
[283:45.55]I'm just fucking... I'm just putting it in.
[283:54.03]Give me this goddamn thing.
[283:57.66]2113.
[283:58.12]It's open.
[284:02.74]Fuck off.
[284:03.82]I'm going in here.
[284:08.00]We aren't even doing that part.
[284:24.39]Or what?
[284:34.74]Do I have anything to put in there?
[284:38.26]Don't.
[284:39.56]I need like wires or fuses or something.
[284:53.77]Whoa, was that the real dog?
[285:09.18]This dog is so happy.
[285:14.22]It didn't do anything for me.
[285:15.46]Alright, where's this train?
[285:18.03]Where's the train?
[285:19.81]There should have been a hundred trains by now.
[285:21.63]That liar.
[285:23.97]What do you think about scuba divers and their gear?
[285:27.71]It's weird.
[285:28.43]I don't know.
[285:28.77]It's too much pressure.
[285:29.55]Is that a tree?
[285:35.35]No.
[285:43.25]Is that the tree right there?
[285:44.07]I don't think so.
[285:53.83]Find the railroad.
[285:54.68]I've kind of been walking in a circle.
[286:02.48]Can I get up there?
[286:12.79]I'm back at the goddamn truck again.
[286:14.17]I swear to God.
[286:20.57]That is... That was the tree?! !
[286:23.05]What do you mean that's the tree?
[286:26.57]No, it's not.
[286:27.97]Somebody said progressive or state farm.
[286:30.77]Get out of here with your corporate bullshit.
[286:33.26]This is the tree.
[286:33.92]You're telling me this is the tree.
[287:10.78]You have to own an air fryer for this part.
[287:18.16]Okay.
[287:23.87]What am I looking at?
[287:25.83]I don't get it.
[287:34.51]I don't get it.
[287:37.60]Go back to the car and walk straight back from the car.
[287:43.41]Go back to the car and go straight back from the car.
[287:45.61]You have to prove you own an air fryer.
[288:05.69]So I'm going to go back this way from the truck.
[288:15.37]Where am I?
[288:16.19]Here?
[288:16.41]Am I going the right way?
[288:24.39]The back of the truck!
[288:54.10]I'm going back.
[288:56.98]I'm going back.
[288:58.96]Before the truck.
[289:01.31]Take care now.
[289:02.15]Bye bye then.
[289:11.24]Now what?
[289:28.62]Is this right?
[289:31.84]To do a BLJ, you have to... That's Mario stuff.
[289:41.42]I've already been... I thought I was writing in a notebook.
[289:45.26]I thought that was like I'm writing in a notepad.
[289:47.20]What is this?
[289:55.41]What the hell?
[290:07.17]That's it?
[290:07.91]That's all that was here?
[290:10.67]That can't be, right?
[290:11.49]It's gotta be here.
[290:14.88]Do you even do anything in this entire game?
[290:18.52]I don't know.
[290:26.24]They implemented this, like, reality-shifting camera.
[290:30.89]I kind of just wanted Slenderman to chase me around the woods with, like, a machete in his hand.
[290:37.42]And now I'm lost again.
[290:49.97]There's nothing else here.
[290:54.05]Please, Among Us VR, I'm begging you.
[290:56.31]I'm not going to say anything.
[291:09.80]Is this... Where am I even going?
[291:12.34]Is this correct?
[291:13.98]No, this is just a circle.
[291:17.88]Please God, play Monk.
[291:19.10]That shit's not going to come out until probably like June or something, guys.
[291:23.45]Focus on the task at hand.
[291:25.83]Finding me in this convoluted-ass game where I need to go record a reality-shifting camera to find the tree that falls down.
[291:38.87]Focus on the task we have in front of us!
[291:52.19]Go back to the car- You guys want me back at the car now?
[291:54.27]Remember this- People are saying the turn left is a railroad from the truck?
[292:08.71]Alright, well I'm going back to the truck.
[292:11.17]I could give this two more attempts.
[292:14.70]Before I uninstall this game.
[292:23.76]Truck is right here.
[292:25.60]It's not this.
[292:30.45]Drive out of the woods.
[292:35.33]Okay, so here's the truck you're saying that there's like a railroad around here somewhere?
[292:39.53]Because I went that way and then I went left.
[292:53.60]Walk from the back of the truck to the tree and then turn left.
[292:56.26]Didn't I just do that?
[292:56.98]I swear to God, I just did that.
[293:16.06]You need to vent.
[293:18.46]Oh, you're making an Among Us joke.
[293:20.24]I'm like, yeah, I kind of do.
[293:22.48]Okay, turn left.
[293:25.72]Oh, yeah, I already went down here, didn't I?
[293:27.98]This is where I just was.
[293:29.20]There's nowhere else to go, right?
[293:32.85]Go left?
[293:33.65]Like, I just was over here.
[293:35.35]There's a path before that.
[294:01.01]Is it this blue shit?
[294:18.30]I can't walk up here, can I?
[294:21.58]Oh my god, I'm walking up this hill.
[294:23.74]Is it this?
[294:32.73]Bros, I think I'm about to fucking flip out.
[294:36.68]Where am I going?
[294:53.33]There's like collision in a lot of these places.
[294:55.45]I can't even, I can't walk over here.
[294:56.77]It's like, it's like walled off.
[295:01.29]That's another path before that?
[295:05.08]That's the only place I can go from there.
[295:06.52]You're saying back of the truck, forward, left path.
[295:08.82]Path potentially before this.
[295:13.22]Do I need neon arrow signs to point me where I need to go?
[295:16.97]I feel like I really should have probably found this by now.
[295:22.89]Right?
[295:23.35]Like, you all don't even understand where to go either.
[295:36.18]Okay, so, like, there's only one way I can go, right?
[295:40.94]There's this way.
[295:43.70]And then there's that way.
[295:45.16]So I'm gonna go, I guess, that way?
[295:46.82]You should just give up.
[295:53.01]I'm kind of about to.
[295:58.65]Everybody gave a shit to, like, Fable 2 when they added the breadcrumb trail to the bottom of the screen.
[296:03.92]But, like...
[296:06.04]Must be real.
[296:08.92]What the fuck am I even doing right now?
[296:15.26]Like, I can't see anything.
[296:16.88]How am I supposed to find anything in this game?
[296:23.95]There's apparently a bridge with a railroad somewhere.
[296:31.53]I was already here.
[296:37.17]Return to the, I gotta read this.
[296:41.83]Gotta read this.
[296:47.66]Return to the road connecting the tree and the bunker.
[296:52.14]There, play the videotape that you found and pause it when the ball lies on the ground.
[296:56.38]This way, I already did that!
[296:59.33]This way, it'll appear next to you.
[297:00.55]Pick it up and let your companion sniff it.
[297:02.65]He'll pick up the trail immediately, follow the doggy, and reach an abandoned small-gauge train.
[297:06.79]There's a fu- What?
[297:09.47]He won't sniff the ball anymore.
[297:10.88]I just did that.
[297:23.28]He did.
[297:23.68]Remember, he smelled it?
[297:28.68]The game is soft lock now?
[297:33.97]Okay, I'm going to tell the dog to search if that works.
[297:36.77]I swear I'm pissed.
[297:39.67]I'm going to be pissed if I have to just tell him to go search.
[297:43.85]I'm going to be pissed.
[297:45.69]Are you ready for me to get really mad?
[297:46.77]Here we go.
[297:48.49]Seek.
[297:50.55]Seek.
[298:22.29]Go back to the truck, okay?
[298:23.95]We're at the truck again.
[298:28.42]What are you finding?
[298:30.18]Find it.
[298:31.82]Come on.
[298:38.72]Okay.
[298:39.76]We're going over here.
[298:41.74]If he runs me in a circle, I'm refinding the game.
[298:46.76]If we go back to where we just were and he like barks and lays down and takes his shit on the ground, I'm refunding the game.
[298:51.12]Where is he?
[299:24.31]Okay, I was here before.
[299:30.70]This is all the way back.
[299:33.36]This is, remember the little... Hey!
[300:04.13]There's a stupid thing!
[300:06.05]Okay, I found... Oh, there it is!
[300:08.53]There it is.
[300:09.21]The dog just had to go find it.
[300:11.23]I'm walking around like an asshole with six senses and I got a super-powered animal that has twelve.
[300:17.16]I have to use the super-powered dog that goes and finds everything.
[300:21.50]I didn't... Okay.
[300:22.90]Alright, fine.
[300:23.92]So, I'm the asshole, okay?
[300:25.32]I'm an asshole.
[300:26.18]I talked a lot of shit about the game.
[300:28.02]Let's be very clear.
[300:29.24]I'm still very upset, but pull out the dumbass webcam, and let's see what happens to this truck.
[300:50.73]Okay.
[300:53.75]Now what?
[301:03.28]Okay, we can go.
[301:04.34]We can just walk through.
[301:06.86]You understand it's blurry.
[301:08.74]It's blurry.
[301:09.68]It's dark.
[301:10.86]It's not calibrated correctly.
[301:17.80]Look, you have to do this, like, go.
[301:20.29]You find it.
[301:23.04]I just spent, how long was that, like an hour walking in a circle and I have a dog that I didn't even use.
[301:33.89]God damn it.
[301:49.59]I'm walking around, like, smelling the ball, like, sniffing the trees and shit, and he just is the thing that I described.
[301:58.12]He is the Fable 2 breadcrumb trail.
[302:00.54]I just didn't use it.
[302:02.62]That's my fault.
[302:03.78]I will take that L. That's my loss.
[302:06.44]But I'm going to be very honest with you.
[302:12.60]Just tell me where to go, dog.
[302:14.06]Just show me where to go.
[302:20.11]No, I'm not going to ask where I'm supposed to go now.
[302:22.15]I know exactly where I need to go.
[302:23.81]Follow the dog in the pitch black video game.
[302:26.23]And I sound very upset.
[302:28.77]You know what you can hear when you're just really upset about something?
[302:34.17]I can't believe I walked around.
[302:35.88]Here's the thing.
[302:36.94]Let me tell you, some of you guys.
[302:41.14]Where was the backseat Andes saying, tell the dog to seek?
[302:46.19]You guys are telling me like, oh, go to the back of the truck, turn left, take 10 paces forward, stop, look at your watch, back up four paces, turn right, look up to the sky.
[302:57.67]No, not one of you said to have the dog help me.
[303:02.23]Not one single person.
[303:04.28]It took an hour and a half.
[303:10.64]I can't believe it took that long.
[303:13.76]Okay, let's all relax.
[303:16.29]Let's chill.
[303:16.93]I'm about to... We're doing progression here.
[303:29.30]Well, the problem is, Jeremy, you're not facing due southwest.
[303:33.74]No, this can't happen.
[303:34.50]You've got to... I need you.
[303:35.70]Go tell me where to go, please.
[304:00.47]Oh man, this has been a wacky day of VR.
[304:03.67]I feel like I've been angry like 35% of the time I've been on this stream right now.
[304:15.56]That's a record.
[304:20.94]You shouldn't have trusted us.
[304:21.96]Well, I was trying to trust you guys because you were trying to help.
[304:24.85]You really were.
[304:25.43]Let's call Lanning.
[304:42.78]I don't have a s- what do you mean call lan- I don't have a signal.
[304:45.47]Bullet!
[304:45.87]Ellis to base.
[304:49.93]Uh, Lanning, where- where are you?
[304:53.15]Still under the tree.
[304:54.75]What?
[304:56.41]So am I. What?
[304:58.91]Are we talking about the same tree?
[305:01.03]White, leafless, uh, black vines all over?
[305:04.66]Yeah, that's the one.
[305:06.18]Look, this doesn't make sense.
[305:09.02]All of this.
[305:09.96]It's just ridiculous.
[305:11.54]God damn it, Ellis.
[305:12.75]It was a mistake letting you come here.
[305:15.25]You wanted to redeem yourself.
[305:16.81]I get it.
[305:17.71]And I wanted to help, but this is too much for you.
[305:20.33]You're not thinking straight.
[305:22.78]Hey, don't talk to me like I'm crazy.
[305:25.08]What do you want me to say, Ellis?
[305:26.64]That it's all fine and dandy?
[305:27.80]Because I sure as hell tried that, and it didn't work.
[305:31.60]Screw you, Emmett.
[305:32.78]I don't need your help.
[305:33.96]It's you who needs me.
[305:35.87]Now, I'm the only person in this goddamn forest who is even remotely close to finding that kid.
[305:44.17]Emmett?
[305:46.03]You there?
[305:48.31]Emmett?
[305:49.41]Goddamn it.
[305:52.05]What the fuck?
[305:53.17]Hey!

[306:01.91]Who is it?

[306:04.90]I'll tell you, Ricky, I'm gonna be real sure as hell pissed off and- What is it?
[306:11.84]What happened?
[306:12.44]Who is it?
[306:13.66]What was that?
[306:15.00]What, did the dog just bite me?

[311:46.40]Hello?
[311:49.87]A message.
[311:51.35]But there's no reception.
[312:00.98]Alright, now let's get to that truck.
[312:24.18]The game now just got good and I'm like exhausted now.
[312:27.18]I think I wanna play this again.
[312:28.66]No, but VR, I can't do anymore VR.
[312:30.68]Maybe when like Among Us comes out.
[312:33.90]I gotta go back to like other games.
[312:36.62]I can't just be VR Andy permanently.
[312:38.39]Alright, put the camera away.
[312:50.67]Let me at least get to the save point.
[312:57.86]Yes, you can.
[312:59.51]No, I really can't, though.
[313:04.09]After I do a VR stream, for like three days after I do it, I'm like locked up.
[313:16.02]Okay, let's get there.
[313:19.64]More of this game, please.
[313:21.20]Okay, I talked a bunch of shit about this game.
[313:24.14]I was unfair.
[313:26.14]That little weird super-fast gremlin guy was actually pretty pog.
[313:30.12]Pretty pog.
[313:34.62]I was just walking in circles for like 40... Are there more than like a hundred people still watching me?
[313:40.43]Considering I walked in a circle for like 40 minutes straight.
[313:44.47]Jesus.
[313:46.67]That's it, okay.
[313:47.53]The light.
[313:51.91]Locked, of course.
[313:58.13]Hey, can I get that?
[313:58.75]What is that?
[314:00.49]I can't reach that.
[314:01.25]Alright.
[314:03.91]Okay, that's it.
[314:06.20]That's it.

[314:21.23]Yeah, there was 16,000.

[319:36.76]Stick around.
[319:37.40]I need to get my credit card and stuff.
[319:44.08]I got to go find my wallet.
[319:47.00]I swear to God it'll be there within five minutes.
[319:53.14]Because I redid some stuff on Twitch.
[319:55.70]I have to put all my info back in.
[320:00.01]I used to be saved, but not anymore.
[320:04.57]Just run ads right now.
[320:12.03]Ad break time.
[320:13.46]But that's so, okay.
[320:15.04]You don't want to run ads?
[320:16.02]Fine.
[320:16.42]Let's run a few ads.
[320:18.10]Give me a minute.
[320:18.54]Let me close out of a few things.
[320:23.02]Alright, stick around.
[320:23.78]I'll be right back.
[320:26.82]Give me a minute.
[320:29.90]Hold on a second.
[320:36.51]Alright.
[320:37.37]One sec.
[320:45.58]you
[321:20.44]you
[321:55.30]Did it go through?
[322:00.11]Did it go through?
[322:01.63]How come it didn't go through?
[322:04.49]What?
[322:26.07]Did that go through?
[322:31.47]My payment couldn't go through?
[322:33.89]Wait, what?
[322:36.87]Hold on.
[322:37.55]Wait.
[322:38.17]What the fuck?
[322:40.67]Oh god.
[322:41.65]Give me a second.
[322:43.49]What the fuck?
[322:44.69]Hold on.
[322:46.73]Did I put my card in wrong?
[322:49.31]One sec.
[323:05.10]you
[323:39.94]Dude, I can't do this.
[324:07.32]I keep getting... Unexpected error has occurred.
[324:11.12]What?
[324:13.92]Literally scammed, yeah.
[324:15.72]I can't do it.
[324:16.18]I don't know why it won't go through.
[324:20.12]He's broke?
[324:25.48]That's weird.
[324:26.18]I don't know why my card's getting declined.
[324:33.57]Okay.
[324:34.87]So, I gotta kind of figure out why that's happening.
[324:42.96]Let me try something else.
[324:44.31]One sec.
[324:47.55]I'm going to try one more time.
[324:49.11]Let me try something else.
[324:50.23]I'll be right back.
[325:24.61]you
[325:53.85]Dude, that didn't work either.
[325:54.94]Is there something wrong with Twitch?
[326:00.42]I tried two or three different payment methods now.
[326:02.00]I think something's wrong.
[326:08.18]I have no idea.
[326:10.64]We're going to have to save this and hold on to this, I think.
[326:13.92]I've tried all the payment methods.
[326:15.28]I don't know what's going on.
[326:20.58]How convenient.
[326:22.36]I have never backed away from a sub, a gift sub.
[326:24.96]You all know that.
[326:33.53]You just did?
[326:34.15]No, but I mean previously, in previous time.
[326:38.49]Hold on to it.
[326:39.45]Next stream, I will do it.
[326:40.73]I gotta figure out why all my payment methods are getting just dropped.
[326:44.53]Purchase could not be completed.
[326:45.61]I don't understand why.
[326:50.32]I don't have, like, a text or anything from, like, a bank.
[326:52.16]No, nothing.
[326:53.02]This won't go through.
[326:56.42]But, uh... We're going to have to do it next stream.
[327:00.04]I'm going to have to figure this out.
[327:02.84]Sorry that was supposed to happen.
[327:04.11]I just tried.
[327:07.21]On Saturday, please remind me.
[327:08.33]I will add it.
[327:12.53]And we'll see you again.
[327:15.85]Take care, everybody.
[327:17.49]Have a great rest of your evening.
[327:22.86]And... See you guys soon.
[327:31.95]Now, because I've got to figure out if that's happening on other services.
[327:33.99]I've got to figure that out.
[327:36.03]Turn off my VPN.
[327:37.33]My VPN's not on.
[327:40.14]I have turned it off before I tried to do it, so don't worry.
[327:44.08]Remind me on Saturday.
[327:45.06]I'll see you guys soon.
[327:45.74]Take care of yourselves.
[327:46.62]Thanks for watching, as always.
[327:47.62]And I'll see you again.
[327:49.52]Good night, guys.
