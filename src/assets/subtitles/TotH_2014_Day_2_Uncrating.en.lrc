[00:03.34]Okay.
[00:04.88]We need to get this green screen working, but, um, that was, that was special.
[00:08.83]Hold on.
[00:09.43]Hold on.
[00:10.55]Hello, hello friends.
[00:11.79]I'm currently unmuted.
[00:13.19]The stream chat can hear me.
[00:16.94]Go ahead and say words while I get this green screen, while I get the cameras ready, basically.
[00:24.93]What was the Jonah in the tub video?
[00:27.93]Oh, there is a lot of context to that.
[00:29.89]There's...
[00:32.16]Do I need to explain anything that you just witnessed?
[00:35.13]I think it's extremely selfish.
[00:37.87]What are you doing in there?
[00:40.01]You have to explain that, because there's such a story behind that.
[00:45.04]You can't let that just sit.
[00:46.80]In the bathtub, giving a peace sign with a duck face is something that...
[00:51.84]came about when we were we had like a short dive kick phase we're playing a bit of dive kick that came to my stream and we had a bet like a best two out of three in dive kick whoever won I forget what you were gonna get if you beat me I don't think it was anything no I think we we just was saying like words we were just making up random bets and like this is the one that you came up with I I came up if I beat you you will pose for a picture in the tub giving a peace sign in your best kawaii like duck face
[01:20.83]And I recorded a video of it instead.
[01:23.87]And you asked me, you asked me, so did you take the picture?
[01:28.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.
[01:30.06]I'm sitting there just doing this, and I'm sitting there.
[01:32.30]The reason why I'm just staring like that, just sitting in a bathtub, I'm waiting for him to take a picture.
[01:37.01]I didn't know he was, like, recording this video in my face.
[01:41.88]It's funny, though.
[01:44.00]And yeah, that absolutely is, uh... That is a full production.
[01:48.93]It was perfect.
[01:49.89]I feel like I learned a lot more about Jerma from that video than I... Like, if it was a Wikipedia page.
[01:55.18]Almost too much.
[01:55.62]If there was a Wikipedia page, I would just skip over it now.
[01:59.63]Hello!
[02:00.95]Hi.
[02:01.35]Alright, alright, you've completed what was supposed to be done.
[02:05.94]So I'm gonna put $500 in.
[02:07.38]I'm gonna do it right now.
[02:09.18]Hello?
[02:09.99]Isn't that in the Bible?
[02:12.53]Hello.
[02:13.43]We're live, and people can hear me for once.
[02:16.30]You guys look beautiful on the stream.
[02:17.86]Thank you.
[02:18.40]So good.
[02:20.38]So we're going to uncrate these.
[02:23.59]So you guys donate towards it, and one person's going to win everything.
[02:26.39]The cat's running the green screen.
[02:27.59]Actually, the cat's helping the green screen.
[02:28.82]That's a lot better.
[02:30.24]Shout out to Jerma for actually donating the $500 for that video.
[02:34.34]True to his word.
[02:35.87]It was a silly challenge.
[02:37.09]How was it?
[02:37.82]I was in my basement getting a chair.
[02:39.46]How was it?
[02:41.18]I was in my basement getting a chair.
[02:42.52]$500 for me to show embarrassing photos of you.
[02:46.67]I know, right?
[02:49.27]What a guy.
[02:50.94]So do we do this now?
[02:52.24]What do we do?
[02:53.32]Yeah, go ahead.
[02:54.04]How do we do this?
[02:55.18]properties I don't know if it was going to be uh... the bad luck like that I don't know if it was going to be the only time that you can see my friends like to be part of the boxing match area alright we're going to get
[03:10.38]What are we going to get?
[03:11.62]We should probably explain why we're unboxing them.
[03:13.56]Okay.
[03:14.87]One of the raffles that has been running the entire weekend, it is $2 center.
[03:18.09]Close the door.
[03:19.03]And it is the uncrating raffle.
[03:22.31]We're about to unbox 200 crates.
[03:23.92]It's a fairly good assortment.
[03:25.80]I think there's some salvage crates in there.
[03:28.32]Kurt is going to show everything unboxed as we go on the stream.
[03:31.48]And the contents of these crates, all 200 crates, is going to be raffled to one winner in the uncrating raffle.
[03:39.91]And that raffle, this is the last hour you can get in that one.
[03:44.32]So, I mean, if we start unboxing 10 Unusuals, you guys need to get more entries in that.
[03:47.72]Good enough.
[03:49.08]And if we get none, you need to get more entries in that.
[03:52.27]It's a good cause.
[03:52.95]It's not about the prizes.
[03:53.93]It's about the cause.
[03:55.55]No, that's fine.
[03:57.09]Just sit in front of it.
[03:58.32]Wow.
[03:59.00]Yeah, just sit over to the side.
[04:00.44]Okay.
[04:01.84]Hello?
[04:03.12]Are we doing it now?
[04:04.02]I wasn't listening.
[04:05.51]Yes, I just informed them that the raffle will end at the end of the hour, and the contents of all 200 is going to one winner, right?
[04:14.24]Yes.
[04:14.50]Yep.
[04:15.25]If it is not obvious enough, Lang and I are fairly tired.
[04:19.13]I think I've gotten about eight hours of sleep in about three days.
[04:22.02]So let's do this.
[04:23.92]Let's open 200 crates.
[04:25.46]Yeah.
[04:26.40]I'm ready.
[04:27.40]I'm glad I'm not in there.
[04:28.78]Shut up, Mela.
[04:30.56]You're in the... Just come on in.
[04:32.27]You can sneak behind us.
[04:33.61]How nice, a regular Scottish Resistance.
[04:35.63]We closed the door to keep the cat out, Mela, but you can come in.
[04:38.15]That's fine.
[04:40.42]Cat face.
[04:41.56]Cat face.
[04:42.44]Apparently I opened the wrong crate.
[04:45.86]Okay, whatever.
[04:46.97]I, like, organized this.
[04:48.35]Look at this.
[04:49.45]I spent so much time, like, one, two, three, four...
[04:54.28]I'll on man whatever disappointment yeah the new key system doesn't exactly show it the same way you might have it organized gee whiz oh well gosh gee will occurs on nights what did you get we got art stuff just wait 30 seconds will up you'll see hope I'll believe you will let you know if we get some cool way a hat
[05:27.32]So, what do you guys think we're gonna get?
[05:29.55]You think we're gonna get... Ooh, we already got a head!
[05:31.67]We got a horrific head splitter.
[05:34.13]I'm anticipating paints.
[05:35.10]A regular.
[05:35.86]Let me see some paint.
[05:38.94]Just call it now.
[05:39.80]You have every crate, like every series, all the strong boxes.
[05:43.07]Not all, like, salvaged ones.
[05:45.47]We do have two salvaged number 40, but we don't have the other ones.
[05:49.54]Just tracking down a number 1 crate, especially hard.
[05:53.90]People were actually donating those.
[05:56.76]I had to buy a couple crates, which was fun, I guess.
[06:00.31]But we pretty much got hooked up with crates by the community.
[06:05.14]Thanks, community, for the crates.
[06:06.42]Thanks, community.
[06:07.52]Also the keys, too.
[06:09.14]But mostly the crates.
[06:10.26]We got paint.
[06:11.09]I forgot to turn that off.
[06:14.09]Hey, look at that.
[06:15.67]It's my room.
[06:16.81]That's my favorite part of my room, by the way.
[06:18.44]We run a very professional show here at Tip of the Hats.
[06:23.63]Only the finest.
[06:27.46]Oh, we got a thawed!
[06:31.56]Wait, where is that?
[06:32.32]Should I join a server so you guys can see what we get?
[06:37.59]JK.
[06:38.89]We're getting pained.
[06:41.61]This is going to last a while.
[06:43.22]Join the server and show me the pain.
[06:44.50]This does take a while.
[06:45.56]Like, if you do the multiplication tables and you figure it out.
[06:49.16]Like, opening crates takes forever.
[06:50.58]Why is it five seconds?
[06:53.06]The anticipation.
[06:55.09]It needs an auto-uncrater.
[06:56.59]You need like a bulldozer crater.
[07:00.35]What's a crater?
[07:02.52]It's a super bulldozer that can unbox just by bulldozing.
[07:06.92]It gets all the crates.
[07:09.06]Oh.
[07:10.59]We're getting weapons.
[07:13.11]You can like use them in the game.
[07:15.96]Like, to do different things that you normally wouldn't be able to do if you didn't have the weapons.
[07:20.05]Uh-huh.
[07:20.49]We're also getting hats.
[07:22.05]Uh-huh.
[07:22.37]But you can't do anything with these besides wear them.
[07:24.94]Yeah.
[07:25.74]But people like this, so good.
[07:28.06]We're actually doing okay.
[07:29.37]I think these paints people like.
[07:31.81]And the hat you can put on your head.
[07:34.05]How many crates are there?
[07:34.93]200.
[07:37.65]We gotta go quick.
[07:38.65]At some point, I believe we did the math, and we determined we have, like... We have, like, 15 seconds per crate, something like that.
[07:45.59]Oh, that's generous.
[07:46.61]I thought I was completely overestimating.
[07:48.82]I was like, oh, what are they, 200?
[07:50.24]Look at this paint!
[07:51.02]We can paint a house!
[07:53.23]There's no houses in this game, though.
[07:55.42]Great googly moogly.
[07:57.56]It's going to take you guys like three hours to do this.
[08:01.17]Uh, real quick, if we happen to not unbox an unusual, which is 200 crates, god, I hope we get at least one.
[08:07.69]But if we happen to not get anything really worthwhile, we're going to throw in one from the donations that we received in the last two days.
[08:13.38]We'll just throw in the ones I donated.
[08:15.47]I like designated one.
[08:17.55]I won't let you know which one.
[08:19.39]Probably the one that's worth the most that I donated.
[08:22.01]I think it's like Prince Tavish Crown...
[08:26.25]purple energy it's cool it's cool it's it's it's pretty uh rats yeah that's what I would call it so yeah for those of you who don't know I'm saying you can double click the keys as well they're like they're like about to leave do you want me to just like do it slower for you guys like spin your your cursor around each key like getting ready like is this the key you want to see how slow we can do it
[08:54.77]Okay, guys, we're setting Kurt's mumble to continuous transmit so we don't have to worry about push to talk.
[09:00.11]Because we don't know how to do that.
[09:01.87]But anyway, I just wanted to say, if you're watching the stream right now and you're like, who are these two weird looking dudes on camera right now?
[09:09.18]I'm Lang.
[09:10.02]I'm one of the producers for Tip of the Hats.
[09:11.67]This is Truck Truck.
[09:12.53]He's the other producer for Tip of the Hats.
[09:14.49]And we've been the ones running the stream.
[09:16.93]I shouldn't say...
[09:18.05]Okay, yeah, we've been running the broadcast aspect of the stream.
[09:21.74]We've not been running the whole show by any means, but we've been running the broadcast of it.
[09:26.00]Of course, we have Shamba and Whiskerbiscuit and all sorts of people.
[09:29.91]We have a whole credits video we're going to show that outlines all of our volunteers and our staff.
[09:34.49]But yeah, as far as the images that you're seeing before you, that's been all myself and TruckTruck here.
[09:40.12]So we decided we'd put ourselves on camera for this part of it while they open up all these crates.
[09:46.08]Isn't it fun?
[09:48.67]I find this fun, but I don't know how to make it entertaining for everybody else.
[09:52.93]You can keep being sarcastic.
[09:54.91]Wow!
[09:56.19]Wow!
[09:57.56]You're throwing the sharp needles at me.
[10:00.48]Getting roasted.
[10:01.28]Yeah.
[10:01.94]Getting roasted on camera.
[10:03.08]It's like a hot iron.
[10:05.15]We got the cameras ready.
[10:07.11]The cameras are ready.
[10:08.25]The cameras are ready.
[10:08.91]Alright, the cameras are ready.
[10:12.23]The cameras are pointing at you.
[10:13.84]Yes.
[10:18.38]Is there, like, an uncrating noise that we're missing here?
[10:20.83]I think we are.
[10:21.55]Hold on.
[10:22.95]Hold on.
[10:23.55]Volume .08.
[10:26.25]What about that production value here?
[10:27.57]Alright, here we go.
[10:28.90]Could you bump that volume up to, like, 20?
[10:31.34]I think the highest it goes is 1.
[10:33.42]I'm not positive.
[10:37.17]Oh, there it is.
[10:37.85]There it is.
[10:38.89]Now we know what the key is doing.
[10:42.03]Before, it was a mystery.
[10:44.83]Now we know it's unlocking the lock.
[10:47.23]We thought we were just combining the two.
[10:50.09]When are we going to start getting strange items?
[10:52.18]I thought you get strangers past crate 20 or something.
[10:58.41]It's deep in there.
[11:00.45]Are these strangers?
[11:01.43]I'm unfamiliar with this unboxing HUD.
[11:03.80]I think when they're red, they're strange for this.
[11:08.55]We need a lot of hats.
[11:09.65]I think there's like a 5% chance you get a hat.
[11:12.22]Oh, oh, oh no, it is the one that says, when they say they're strange, they're strange.
[11:17.72]Oh, I thought you, okay, we got a wrench.
[11:21.17]Uh, but, I thought, I thought I was the one dropping the S's in this, in this, uh, chat right here.
[11:26.91]You're the one throwing them at me.
[11:29.83]Oh, I got strange Mad Milk.
[11:32.44]Alright, I'm gonna go to this page.
[11:34.10]There we go.
[11:35.72]Harold is sorry.
[11:37.68]It's okay.
[11:41.29]Look at all this paint we're getting.
[11:43.87]So, I guess there's a 1% chance of getting an Unusual, right?
[11:48.46]So, I guess two Unusuals is hopefully what we'll get?
[11:54.54]Expected yield.
[11:56.98]I'm hoping for one really nice one.
[11:58.97]Can we get those TFT economists back here and have them crunch the numbers?
[12:01.63]That would actually be really helpful.
[12:03.23]That actually would be nice if we had Matty.
[12:05.34]How inefficient is using keys?
[12:07.96]I know people, you're better off buying stuff with the keys, but where's the fun in uncrating, you know?
[12:20.29]Oh my gooses, look at these hats.
[12:22.97]I'm pretty sure it's a very small percentage to get hats and we've gotten multiple.
[12:28.44]I'm being told you should be double clicking.
[12:30.30]I don't know what on.
[12:31.26]You know how much further it is to click there?
[12:33.84]Like not much further.
[12:35.08]Okay.
[12:36.13]And I've also had like 30, I've been awake for about 30 hours.
[12:40.79]I'm gonna let you do your thing, K. Russ.
[12:42.45]Don't, don't uh, don't let him hang.
[12:45.16]Mei looks pretty good at TF2, maybe he can do it.
[12:47.46]Yeah, I wanted him to come in here so I didn't have to embarrass myself being half awake trying to be entertaining.
[12:53.67]I mean, if you want to swap out... But I think he falls in the same boat, so we all kind of do.
[12:58.56]I need to bring up something really important.
[13:01.28]The clicking part isn't, like, difficult.
[13:03.93]Okay.
[13:04.17]I'm pretty sure the stream disagrees, but... I think as far as being time efficient, I think I'm still doing okay.
[13:11.64]Now I'm unboxing these hats.
[13:13.36]I'm unboxing them.
[13:15.02]It's not how you open up a crate.
[13:16.28]You gotta open up a crate with super glue.
[13:18.83]You don't use keys.
[13:21.29]Because we don't have to buy these crates.
[13:24.57]We already have them.
[13:25.75]Hey, you got some.
[13:28.70]Do you want to take the seat?
[13:30.50]Do you want to take the hot seat?
[13:33.91]So we have Mela here.
[13:35.52]He just wanted to stop by and make things... There's like nowhere to sit.
[13:40.19]Well, you could take my spot.
[13:42.05]I could sit where Curtis is sitting.
[13:43.88]We're going to shift over because I'm probably the least favorite person of the three here.
[13:47.41]I don't know about that, Chris.
[13:48.69]I like you a whole lot.
[13:49.61]I'm going to sit where Curtis is sitting.
[13:52.07]And then we're going to play some musical chairs here.
[13:56.44]I'm going to try to scoot over as much as I can because we've got to kind of compress.
[14:00.08]It's okay.
[14:01.45]It's okay, man.
[14:02.79]You can get closer.
[14:03.43]Female viewership is rising.
[14:06.81]Hi.
[14:08.32]It's great, yeah.
[14:09.46]Hi, how you doing?
[14:11.10]So we're just going to open up some crates here.
[14:13.71]Yeah, sure.
[14:14.41]That sounds great.
[14:16.91]You gotta go faster, Lang.
[14:18.17]The chat's getting really upset.
[14:20.14]You're not triple-clicking.
[14:21.22]Let me integrate this energy key into my workflow.
[14:23.02]Well, you're unboxing them out of order.
[14:25.82]Listen.
[14:27.65]I'm doing regular keys.
[14:28.65]It's important to not... We've got a strange fan.
[14:36.84]I think if I move over a little bit more and if Hale moves over a bit more... Do you want to get in here?
[14:41.69]The problem is we're all over six feet tall.
[14:44.84]Why isn't Bloodstyre here?
[14:46.44]We need him.
[14:47.30]Where is he when you need him?
[14:48.25]I like this look I got going on here.
[14:49.93]Yeah, okay, that's good.
[14:50.81]This looks good.
[14:52.75]I'm Maela's bodyguard.
[14:54.32]Yeah.
[14:54.86]That's what it looks like.
[14:57.64]We got a lot of strange parts.
[14:59.99]How many crates have you opened?
[15:01.69]Like 20.
[15:03.74]I think 50.
[15:06.00]If it's two pages, it's 50.
[15:06.94]Strange shovel.
[15:08.18]That's quality.
[15:09.23]That's one of those items that's just like, wow.
[15:11.23]Trying for some 2017, too.
[15:12.39]Strange conch.
[15:13.95]We got a strange conch.
[15:16.44]I'm going to watch the stream on my phone.
[15:25.49]Not on the laptop here?
[15:26.37]You are the stream.
[15:29.03]I'll see what the difference between the streams are.
[15:33.08]Lots of strange parts.
[15:34.71]Did you say something, Star?
[15:36.81]Pretend I didn't.
[15:37.95]Okay.
[15:38.49]Hi, Star.
[15:39.89]Hey, Melekun, Air Senpai.
[15:44.86]His name's Harold.
[15:49.00]Strange Crudicola.
[15:55.03]I think we've got a flow going here.
[16:01.10]Oh, we have no more crates.
[16:03.46]Wait, what were those crates?
[16:06.16]The yellow ones?
[16:06.98]Yeah, they're like the salvage ones, but they're newer.
[16:10.25]Salty, I totally thought it was the team captain.
[16:12.65]Me too.
[16:13.59]Oh, no, those are... There we go.
[16:20.76]We got any cool donation comments we want to read off?
[16:24.77]Yeah, the one time no one reads donation comments.
[16:27.83]This would probably be the time.
[16:29.69]No one taught me how.
[16:31.21]To be serious, for once in my life, is there a... Is the donations for this unboxing still open, or is it closed?
[16:45.34]Okay.
[16:45.62]If it's still open, you've probably... You've seen us unbox a couple hats, and there's a bunch of crates that's still open.
[16:52.37]At least 150, I would say.
[16:54.23]Dude, this is rough.
[16:56.35]I've got a... I want to give a rundown really quick of the raffles.
[17:01.11]Our timed raffle with the Australian fan and collector's flare gun, that will end at 11 p.m.
[17:08.97]Eastern.
[17:09.91]All of our other raffles, except for the crate unboxing raffle, will also end at 11 p.m.
[17:14.69]Eastern.
[17:16.86]The auctions will end then as well.
[17:19.42]The crate unboxing ends in 39 minutes.
[17:23.51]Oh, God.
[17:24.86]That's so funny.
[17:28.23]Some dude, the chat's just chatting and all of a sudden it's just, Jerma sucks.
[17:33.27]I gave him Jerma owns.
[17:34.70]I got him.
[17:35.50]I gave him a zinger.
[17:37.16]Counter argument.
[17:38.28]We've opened like ten strangers in a row.
[17:40.90]I've been quiet for the last five minutes.
[17:43.33]Jerma sucks.
[17:48.17]Getting all these strangers, man.
[17:55.78]Oh my god.
[17:58.02]Please.
[17:59.54]I know what the feeling is.
[18:01.28]You started to think.
[18:02.65]I like chat right now.
[18:04.41]What is it?
[18:04.95]Oh my god.
[18:05.75]It's all different stuff.
[18:08.31]Jerome's getting roasted in there.
[18:10.13]Oh my god.
[18:10.87]There's like a bonfire.
[18:13.46]Holy hell.
[18:15.36]That's a lot of people.
[18:17.18]It's okay.
[18:17.60]They're joking.
[18:18.96]All I do is open strangers.
[18:21.92]I disagree.
[18:27.17]What is happening?
[18:30.97]Thousands of people collectively are just saying that I suck.
[18:35.22]Twitch user Star says, Jerma is okay, actually.
[18:40.56]You caught that?
[18:43.35]You can't put anything past Mike.
[18:46.79]Seriously, how many strangers in a row is this?
[18:48.43]Is anyone keeping count?
[18:49.82]When you hit past crate 25 or something...
[18:55.38]the least you'll get is a strange.
[18:56.88]Oh, seriously?
[18:57.36]That's like a thing?
[18:58.75]Yeah.
[18:59.99]Besides that, giving someone regular items for $2.50 is probably... That'd be roasting them, right?
[19:06.54]That'd be roasting.
[19:07.28]If you spend a lot of money on crates, you're gonna get at least not garbage.
[19:12.19]Got it.
[19:12.95]Get some strange shovels up in here.
[19:15.41]That strange shovel collection.
[19:17.95]That young shovel collection.
[19:20.82]Probably worth about as much of a regular shovel.
[19:23.71]Sherman just really sucks.
[19:26.02]It's still going.
[19:27.92]It's just not stopping.
[19:30.43]He's probably like, oh yeah, all these people agree with me.
[19:33.07]Are you sure you don't want to just kneel down back here?
[19:40.02]I like this spot.
[19:41.04]You can take my spot, Kurt.
[19:42.18]No, I like this spot.
[19:43.49]I feel confident.
[19:45.06]not being on stream right okay taking the easy route I understand you've had you've had a long weekend you've had a long month you don't have to blame me when we don't get an unusual okay I I will I will I'm taking the safe route I will shoulder this burden I am ready safety straps yes safety rockets yes is that all we have left no there's no way you're going that quick no we have a ton I'm still on regular keys like
[20:12.85]Somebody has suggested that you read out the names of some of the items, but I don't know.
[20:16.40]It's 200 items.
[20:18.36]Well, you can go on TF2 Wikipedia, and then there's a crate section, and it shows you what's in each crate.
[20:26.11]I guarantee you we're going to get every one of the highest percentage stuff, because we have really bad luck right now.
[20:34.54]Right now!
[20:36.26]I'd like to recap to the last tip of the hat.
[20:39.65]What did you get?
[20:40.97]We got, uh, Unusual Sunbeam's Brigade Helm.
[20:44.99]I think it was worth, like, multiple buds.
[20:48.32]I think it was worth, like, five, six buds, something like that.
[20:51.36]Whoa, what is this?
[20:52.08]I got a few buds right here.
[20:53.08]Dope.
[20:53.20]Oh, you can open it and it gives you a bunch of paints?
[20:58.16]Yeah, you actually can uncrate that painting set to get paint.
[21:02.85]More paint?
[21:03.97]Yeah.
[21:04.27]Whoa.
[21:04.67]It's meta paint.
[21:08.05]People are hyped for this.
[21:09.84]People are high.
[21:10.54]People love watching crates get unboxed.
[21:12.25]I guess it's like not often that this happens.
[21:16.20]The 200 is a lot.
[21:17.73]Like the roll, like the...
[21:20.27]You're just climbing up to the top of the roller coaster, and hopefully you come back down.
[21:25.16]But if you don't unbox it, you're not coming back down.
[21:27.88]You're just stuck up there.
[21:28.80]Yeah, you're just stuck.
[21:31.57]Can I just make a comment here?
[21:34.03]Yeah, it's moving on to Star Sucks.
[21:36.12]Alright, since you mentioned it on screen, it's probably going to... And now it is.
[21:39.62]I mean, it is happening anyway.
[21:41.48]But I put the nail in the coffin of Star Ducks.
[21:45.61]Star Ducks.
[21:46.21]Here it comes.
[21:48.01]Well, now they just moved on to star sucks.
[21:50.76]Like, it didn't really help.
[21:52.86]Oh, yeah.
[21:53.06]Oh, God.
[21:53.76]Yeah.
[21:55.10]It happened.
[21:57.26]Oh, my.
[21:57.90]Here, let me open the crate.
[21:59.48]Yeah, we got some magic touch.
[22:01.89]No, let me just do one.
[22:02.51]That's not bad.
[22:03.11]Oh, my God, your sense.
[22:05.37]How do you do this?
[22:06.13]I like this mouse pad, though.
[22:07.63]Thanks.
[22:08.73]Where did it go?
[22:09.65]It's over here.
[22:11.46]You almost turned off the stream.
[22:13.00]That'd be funny.
[22:15.24]We're done.
[22:16.96]Bye, guys.
[22:19.30]We're done.
[22:20.20]Where'd they go?
[22:22.00]You gotta go further left.
[22:23.50]There we go.
[22:24.57]That's not all the way left.
[22:26.89]That's why I don't reach in.
[22:29.27]You're gonna want to alt-tab.
[22:35.44]15.
[22:36.18]It'd be ridiculous if you got one right here.
[22:38.73]What are the odds?
[22:42.25]Nice!
[22:44.58]You did it.
[22:45.36]You did it.
[22:46.74]It's a viable weapon.
[22:48.76]Truck trucks!
[22:50.81]Nice!
[22:54.07]I've been basically laughing at everything all weekend.
[22:58.84]I'm pretty sure they both can attest to this.
[23:00.81]When you're sitting in a room alone while, uh,
[23:05.23]People are having a good time.
[23:06.51]I'm having a good time too, but being alone for days on end is rough.
[23:11.54]You have some trubs there.
[23:12.62]There's been some chucks.
[23:13.60]We've established a new form of pack communication.
[23:16.87]Basically, we just do a high-pitched laugh that echoes throughout the house, and then we know the chucks are happening.
[23:21.82]He goes through his mic when he's trying to play.
[23:26.70]My mic picks up everything.
[23:28.05]It really does.
[23:29.43]Even me typing quietly is thunderous on your mic.
[23:34.70]lot of paints moved on to me now TF2 sucks how about that guys let's do that one lang is beautiful can that be the next one I'd be okay with that that's three words you gotta really put a lot of effort into that yeah beautiful is a lot and that's yeah that's a lot of silver way too much you have to really work on that one truck punch line what that doesn't make sense
[24:04.43]I think we're in the paint section now.
[24:05.81]Hey, someone put the free goal in there.
[24:07.19]Nice.
[24:07.67]And the surf.
[24:08.50]This is the most viewers we've had all day.
[24:12.92]It is.
[24:13.10]Sort of sad, but I don't even care.
[24:15.71]Hashtag for the kids.
[24:17.29]This is almost the actual game of CS2.
[24:20.63]This is like the pre-game.
[24:22.39]This is almost not a menu.
[24:26.18]It's several menus combined.
[24:30.68]Please.
[24:34.42]If you win this raffle, you can be a buckaroo.
[24:42.25]I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'd actually like to go over some of the promotions we have right now.
[24:49.44]We have a couple of promotions, some real big important stuff you guys are going to want to know about the charity stream.
[24:54.03]Big shout out to Basil.
[24:56.07]That's all I got.
[24:57.31]Okay.
[24:58.73]I have something to say that's important.
[25:00.19]Okay.
[25:01.36]We're actually, like, on the front page of Twitch.
[25:03.30]Like, the front page.
[25:04.76]Like, people that are on Twitch right now are seeing us right now.
[25:07.65]Hey, what's up, guys?
[25:08.39]We're unboxing some crates.
[25:10.49]Welcome to the crate cast.
[25:13.39]Thanks, Twitch John.
[25:16.56]Every time you put me on the front page, it goes so well.
[25:24.45]There's so many things that suck, man.
[25:25.81]You just started the shibby thing.
[25:27.32]Why did you do that?
[25:28.40]Because I... Now someone's going to comment on a shibby video and say that Tip of the Hats hates him.
[25:34.47]I thought it was funny because he's just not even here.
[25:36.65]That just has nothing to do with anything.
[25:38.95]Terrible.
[25:39.68]I guess he's TF2-er.
[25:40.86]It's a TF2 stream.
[25:42.58]It has everything to do with AsusGamer and shibby.
[25:45.59]Oh, man.
[25:46.17]We brought another person into the room.
[25:48.53]Oh, no.
[25:48.89]Star!
[25:49.61]We're really not going to unbox an unusual?
[25:51.57]Or have we unboxed one we just not noticed?
[25:54.10]It's possible!
[25:55.18]It was the buckaroo hat all along.
[25:56.92]Yeah, it was the buckaroo hat.
[25:58.82]Anything's possible.
[26:01.58]That's going to be so sad.
[26:04.53]Lessons will be learned if this doesn't happen.
[26:11.39]This is kind of research into the item system.
[26:14.69]Look at... We still have a lot of stuff left, Kurt.
[26:17.48]We're close.
[26:19.74]I'm scared.
[26:20.42]To be serious, let's get serious.
[26:21.93]I'm really not going to make another joke.
[26:24.07]Because we are on the front page of Twitch.
[26:26.68]Does somebody want to talk about charity for a second?
[26:28.91]Oh yeah, that's true.
[26:29.69]You know what?
[26:30.07]I can do that.
[26:30.65]I can multitask.
[26:31.65]So, if you are watching this stream and thinking, why are these people with glasses and hair opening crates in front of a poorly cropped green screen on the front page of Twitch?
[26:41.67]Well, I am here to tell you that we are Tip of the Hat, and we are a TF2-based charity annual livestream fundraiser event.
[26:49.18]And the thing we are raising money for is One Step Camp.
[26:51.95]What One Step Camp does is they hold camps throughout the year for kids with cancer.
[26:55.59]And it costs about $2,000 to send one kid to camp for about two weeks.
[26:59.20]And you might be thinking to yourself, Lang, you don't know my name this way that you're saying that.
[27:03.01]But you're thinking, Lang, that's a lot of dollars to send a kid to camp for two weeks.
[27:06.68]But I would say that One Step Camp really stretches that money as far as they can.
[27:12.13]They have an entire medical staff.
[27:13.91]They basically have a whole cancer ward on site at these camps.
[27:17.36]And they really just try to do everything they can to bring the treatment to the kids so that they don't have to interrupt the fun, they don't have to interrupt their activities, and they can just focus on being a kid and having a great time.
[27:27.17]So what One Step Camp does is really great, and they really make a difference in these kids' lives.
[27:31.18]And One Step Camp...
[27:32.80]You know, they not only focus on the kids, but they focus on the families of cancer, because cancer doesn't just affect the individual, it affects the family.
[27:38.85]And One Step Camp is really aware of that, and they do a fantastic job of providing support for the whole family of the affected child.
[27:44.58]So they're truly a wonderful organization, and I urge you to go check them out over at onestepcamp.org, and you can check us out at tipofthehats.org.
[27:53.93]What was that?
[27:54.61]That was amazing.
[27:56.53]That was very well done.
[27:57.95]That was exactly the point of the entire stream.
[28:01.13]Right there.
[28:03.82]Why are you opening boxes out?
[28:05.64]Why are you opening boxes out?
[28:07.78]Why are you opening crates?
[28:08.70]What is this?
[28:09.81]Wait, are we, uh... We broke 9,000.
[28:11.85]Have we done that yet?
[28:13.45]Oh, are we over 9,000 viewers?
[28:14.69]We were a second ago.
[28:15.65]We're gonna round up to the nearest 9,000 and say that we're over 9,000 viewers.
[28:19.16]No, we were at 9,070 a second ago.
[28:20.86]Okay, so we've officially broken 9,000 viewers.
[28:23.16]Which I believe we did actually very briefly yesterday?
[28:26.83]Question mark?
[28:27.57]I'm not sure.
[28:28.05]It's been a long couple days.
[28:29.15]Maybe.
[28:29.47]But in any case, we're gonna open these crates.
[28:35.48]Just had another $100 donation.
[28:38.58]Nice!
[28:39.20]Thank you!
[28:40.20]Adam Spickard.
[28:41.00]Feel free to read off the donation comments.
[28:45.23]It's really echoey.
[28:46.27]We don't want to say anything I don't think because we're echoing.
[28:48.80]Oh, okay.
[28:49.34]Sorry.
[28:51.18]I'll turn it down more.
[28:55.31]As far as I can hear you guys.
[28:56.35]Yeah.
[29:03.78]I'm just with I'm we are about 25 more how many did reopen 200 I'm totally doing I'm I'm I wasn't so far this is where it comes out of nowhere there's two we've opened two hundred are no no no two hundred store orders told me we have we don't know how many like 150 I'll my right around 150 got a lot of strangers
[29:33.61]That's a thing.
[29:35.91]I can't even sound positive while saying that.
[29:38.60]Please.
[29:39.10]Please be.
[29:39.52]There's a sword.
[29:41.44]We got a sword.
[29:43.08]You can kill stuff with that.
[29:44.28]You can sword some gamers.
[29:47.81]We got a sword.
[29:50.93]We got a saw.
[29:51.43]Saw with your sword.
[29:54.36]We got a shod.
[29:59.33]We got some boopy boppers!
[30:01.17]Alright, those are pretty good.
[30:02.33]Alright, those are worth a lot.
[30:03.44]Alright.
[30:04.14]Spirits are lifted.
[30:05.10]We can boop some boppers.
[30:11.39]Oh, look at that!
[30:11.85]We got a samurai sword!
[30:13.71]We got a lot of swords.
[30:15.48]Now, everyone who doesn't know what's going on still even more, like at TF2 at all, I just want to say there's a 1% chance these people will care about what's happening.
[30:26.36]That is very true.
[30:27.48]Dude, the 200th crate, you're going to open it, and it's going to freeze for a second at zero, and out of the box is going to come, like, a Skype, like, via Skype video of Gabe Newell.
[30:40.14]Okay.
[30:40.40]And he's going to be like, hello, everybody, it's me, Gabe Newell.
[30:42.88]I just want to say hi, and you are getting an unusual.
[30:46.03]Sorry.
[30:46.45]That was almost an Obama impression.
[30:49.35]Hello, everyone.
[30:49.99]I'd just like to say thank you for opening crates in America.
[30:53.67]Gabe Newell's gonna come on the stream.
[30:54.93]It's a crown, it's not unusual.
[30:56.51]Gabe Newell's gonna come on the stream and just say, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, you ain't no friend of me.
[31:01.38]And he's gonna delete all the items we unboxed.
[31:07.32]Because we ain't no friend of he.
[31:10.24]ain't no friend of me.
[31:12.46]So many regular keys.
[31:13.42]I'm just doing the regular keys first.
[31:14.64]Yeah, that's why I thought we didn't have many, because those are just regular keys.
[31:18.33]We have a lot to go, actually.
[31:19.37]We have a lot to go.
[31:20.55]Yeah, I forgot.
[31:21.09]I want you to start clicking faster.
[31:22.27]I was getting scared.
[31:23.45]No, you have time.
[31:24.40]Let me see how much time you got.
[31:26.90]You got 25 minutes.
[31:28.26]Okay.
[31:29.54]Speedrun strats.
[31:36.06]Please.
[31:37.62]Here.
[31:38.28]Take a seat.
[31:38.90]Oh man.
[31:39.94]I'm tagging him in.
[31:40.58]Mela's scared.
[31:41.14]I'm bowing out.
[31:41.76]I'm tagging him in.
[31:42.39]Mela's... I'm about to cry.
[31:44.41]It's... It's a hat.
[31:47.09]We got a sweatband.
[31:48.24]Okay.
[31:49.80]Please.
[31:50.58]You scared me.
[31:52.92]Someone call an ambulance.
[31:55.31]Please.
[31:57.23]Please.
[31:57.67]So many strangers.
[31:59.85]Not only the money spent for the keys, but the man hours spent to open them is ruining my spirits.
[32:07.78]Hey, you never know.
[32:08.60]This is what it takes.
[32:10.43]You gotta go through this to get a good one, you know?
[32:12.73]If we learned anything from Maddy and Bogan today, it's that TF2 economy is real.
[32:19.66]This is the... You gotta do some work to get something good, you know?
[32:24.55]You have to make some sacrifices.
[32:26.95]Hopefully you get something good.
[32:32.50]Yeah, good luck.
[32:36.33]Strange Kukri.
[32:38.79]We're almost out of regular crates, guys, so this is when it's gonna start getting into these novelty crates, these special crates.
[32:44.10]Yeah.
[32:44.82]And who knows what's gonna happen.
[32:45.94]Just to reiterate, if we do not unbox an unusual, we will throw in one of my unusuals that I donated to this raffle.
[32:55.75]Yes.
[32:56.31]So you will get an unusual if you are the winner of this, regardless.
[32:59.86]Don't worry.
[33:02.20]Hopefully it doesn't have to come down to that.
[33:03.76]This is the last regular crate.
[33:11.63]The last regular crate.
[33:12.87]Number 75.
[33:14.74]Please.
[33:15.52]Aw.
[33:15.98]That's like a head.
[33:21.00]But it's a weapon head.
[33:23.11]Alright, these are the salvage crates.
[33:24.77]Open the salvage crate.
[33:31.82]Okay, more strangers.
[33:32.94]Perfect.
[33:33.42]Just what I wanted.
[33:34.92]Let's just go right down the line.
[33:36.28]Reserve manco supply crate.
[33:38.07]Okay.
[33:38.67]I don't know most of these crates.
[33:39.99]What is that?
[33:40.89]I don't know.
[33:41.19]They're like the salvage crates, kind of, but they're not as expensive.
[33:45.18]Ooh.
[33:45.30]What?
[33:46.56]Pompson 6,000 stranger fire.
[33:48.10]So it's essentially a strange, but it's a thing that makes something strange instead of it actually being strange.
[33:53.21]In pog form, yes.
[33:54.83]I think that's what it does.
[33:58.81]A strange part?
[33:59.87]Like a Hadouken.
[34:01.48]yeah over 9000 xd there you go I read it do we have any more regular keys alright now we're doing the oh oh what we need one more we need one more for that one we'll do that one that one last we'll do that one at the very end we'll do that one at the very end are we okay so not over here here you want to do this yeah the robo crates are sweet okay we're opening some robo crates

[34:39.39]Tungsten Took?
[34:43.12]Beautiful.
[34:43.34]I like the... most of the robo effects.
[34:49.51]We got a pellet of crates and a bolted bicorn.
[35:01.75]This crate effect is intense.
[35:05.13]Okay.

[36:29.34]So many XTs.
[36:31.86]You like golf bag?
[36:36.37]I look over here when you unbox a hat and I'm like, wow, you got a hat.
[36:39.47]That was 30 seconds ago.
[36:43.72]Oh, nice, you just got a hat.
[36:44.80]Wait, I'm here.
[36:46.34]I'm here watching you do it.
[36:47.40]I'm actually in the room.
[36:49.75]Oh my gosh.
[36:50.81]Come on.
[36:51.89]I'm wondering... I think we might need a couple keys.
[36:54.71]No, we need one.
[36:55.79]The reason we need one is someone donated a salvage crate right at the end.
[37:01.88]So I didn't delete the crate I had before.
[37:04.47]I think you're right.
[37:14.76]Excuse me.
[37:16.15]Guys, we're coming up on 10,000 viewers.
[37:18.00]We got 9,600.
[37:18.98]You are excited.
[37:20.16]Oh, we got a chameleon.
[37:21.91]Chameleon.
[37:23.13]We got a Charizard.
[37:25.65]Alright, so if you want a Charizard, get on this raffle.
[37:30.38]Jerma sucks, $1.
[37:32.39]Oh, wow, we got the bros here.
[37:37.37]I'm like feeling the pain, I'm rocking back and forth.
[37:41.75]I'm great.
[37:43.37]I'm never doing this on my own.
[37:45.30]Like, if I didn't have you guys here, I'd be having like a breakdown right now.
[37:50.36]Please.
[37:50.90]I am responsible for the Kratos.
[37:52.29]Yes.
[37:55.13]What even was that?
[37:56.55]It was the Gaelic Garb.
[37:58.13]I don't know what it was, but it was called the Gaelic Garb.
[38:00.32]Okay.
[38:05.26]How to Raffle.
[38:07.05]Yes!
[38:11.78]I'm great!
[38:12.98]You are great!
[38:17.66]There's the Gaelic Garb over there on that screen.
[38:21.55]Oh, he got some sneakers!
[38:23.95]Look at those little tapin' shoes!
[38:34.35]How many more are left?
[38:36.20]Enough.
[38:37.02]I hope.
[38:38.10]It looks like 20.
[38:39.56]It looks like around 20, I hope.
[38:41.89]We're getting down to it, man.
[38:44.94]We need a whisker to unbox.
[38:46.26]I think he's unboxed at least two Unusuals.
[38:48.84]Oh my god, it's Little Potty!
[38:51.23]Look at him!
[38:52.35]He's so cute!
[38:56.58]I opened the middle one.
[38:58.00]What am I doing?
[38:58.66]Oh, shoot.
[38:59.18]I misclicked.
[38:59.98]Oh, cheese and crackers.
[39:01.45]Oh, cheese and crackers.
[39:02.77]Oh, you got a dead raccoon.
[39:05.95]Maybe it's alive, but he's holding a... I don't know.
[39:12.36]Hey, there's a buddy on that screen.
[39:15.07]Hey, we got another birdie.
[39:15.91]Another buddy.
[39:16.61]It's his brother.
[39:18.41]That's also a different species of bird.
[39:20.30]Yep.
[39:21.46]Complicated family.
[39:25.28]This is just shameful.
[39:26.74]Big man on campus.
[39:27.77]Okay.
[39:30.27]This is not what I wanted to do.
[39:31.79]Okay.
[39:33.66]How do uncrate?
[39:36.08]How do and how to uncrate?
[39:37.70]Okay.
[39:39.77]Founding father.
[39:40.41]It's pretty dope.
[39:41.61]It's not unusual.
[39:44.31]I'm pretty sure you guys are setting a record right now.
[39:45.98]I'm going to have to uncrate the next one.
[39:47.46]This is my last one I'm going to uncrate.
[39:48.92]Alright.
[39:50.12]That was level 99, by the way.
[39:53.67]That probably doesn't mean anything.
[39:54.65]69?
[39:56.23]Go!
[40:03.44]The Woolly Warrior!
[40:08.09]Alright, we got these acorns.
[40:09.47]We're going to put these acorns into some cardboard, and we're going to see what happens.
[40:13.04]So we got, like, 10 left.
[40:17.76]That is really cool, though.
[40:19.89]I don't know what that was.
[40:22.52]Dude, we're getting roasted.
[40:23.40]This is like the ultimate roasting of...
[40:31.36]Alright, that's probably worth winning the entire raffle.
[40:35.31]I love Truck Truck.
[40:36.27]Thank you for donating.
[40:38.81]Real quick, just a reminder, the raffle for the uncrating, the contents of what we're going to get here, is ending in 15 minutes.
[40:45.76]The rest of them will all end at 11 Eastern, but the uncrating one ends in 15 minutes.
[40:50.07]Got it.
[40:50.39]Thank you.
[40:56.16]But where can I win Ty's exquisite rack?
[40:59.24]Please.
[41:00.76]I bet you we... I wonder if we... No.
[41:03.23]I'm sure the chat would know.
[41:04.23]This is so hard.
[41:07.28]I'm sorry.
[41:07.92]I'm not sorry just yet.
[41:09.68]We have a little bit more to go.
[41:11.39]It's not your fault, I don't think you made it.
[41:12.51]It's just gonna be a new, unusual effect.
[41:14.02]Trust me.
[41:15.28]Trust me.
[41:16.30]We got four more to unbox.
[41:17.26]We're officially at 10,000 viewers.
[41:18.36]Okay, we gotta... We gotta... More crates.
[41:21.41]Alright.
[41:22.01]That's the worst.
[41:23.49]Don't forget, we need to get a key for this one.
[41:25.39]We need to get a key for that one.
[41:26.24]We need to get a key for that one.
[41:27.34]So, I'm gonna guess Whisker Biscuit, I'm hoping, is on that and he'll give us a key.
[41:31.36]But, we're down to the last four crates.
[41:33.71]Three of which we can open right now.
[41:34.73]And those are the stuff I found during the stream.
[41:36.67]You get those too.
[41:39.37]Okay, so we're going to open this young crate here.
[41:42.35]This is the newest crate.
[41:44.46]The strong box.
[41:45.92]Open the strong box.
[41:47.52]Yep, I'm sure.
[41:50.92]Come on, Star.
[41:51.62]Give it to us.
[41:52.50]Give it to us one time.

[42:46.35]It was 199 crates.
[42:47.87]Oh, right.
[42:48.50]No, I think it was 200.
[42:49.34]Oh, this is 201.
[42:50.50]We had 200 keys.
[42:51.68]Okay.
[42:52.02]But we had 201 crates because reasons.
[42:55.43]Because reasons.
[42:56.49]Godspeed fellow gamers, says Jason.
[42:59.07]They can't see this on stream because of the thingy.
[43:01.54]But thank you.
[43:03.50]Jason, okay.
[43:04.92]That's who Jason is.
[43:06.23]He kept saying Jason.
[43:07.51]I didn't know.
[43:08.23]Do you want to do it, Kurt?
[43:13.45]I think Mela should do it, honestly.
[43:14.97]Okay, no, no, no.
[43:15.77]Nope, we're getting up.
[43:16.70]We're getting up now.

[43:21.79]Yeah, okay.
[43:22.45]Is it just me on camera for this?

[43:25.13]You know what?
[43:25.87]I'm gonna, I'll be here for some moral support.
[43:28.38]Okay.
[43:28.92]Do you want to just embrace during this?
[43:30.90]How about we all, no, that's weird.
[43:32.71]Okay.
[43:33.56]We should all touch the mouse, but you know... Okay, open it and everyone should run out of the room.
[43:41.81]I'm just gonna open this.
[43:42.55]Yeah, just click it and just run out before it opens.
[43:44.66]As soon as you click it, just get out of here.
[43:46.68]Yeah, let's just leave.
[43:48.00]Let's just leave.
[43:48.72]Everybody just click it and get out.
[43:50.08]Here we go.
[43:51.32]Get behind the green screen.
[43:53.77]I'm racing for cover!
[43:57.39]Damn it!
[43:59.96]We got these young... We got some sneakers!
[44:02.68]Two shoes, two feet.
[44:04.06]Makes sense.
[44:04.86]Math checks out.
[44:06.20]So, um... You still will win an unusual if you win this raffle, by the way.
[44:10.87]Yeah, as per our promise, we're gonna supply an unusual to the winner of this raffle anyway.
[44:15.23]Look at this!
[44:16.34]190 strangers.
[44:19.64]That's insane.
[44:20.28]We got some sneakers, though!
[44:21.90]That's insane.
[44:22.34]We got some lame sneakers.
[44:24.22]We just got roasted by Valve.
[44:28.21]So hard.
[44:29.61]Chestnuts over open fire.
[44:31.79]Oh my god.
[44:32.61]That is unbelievable.
[44:35.94]Oh man.
[44:37.62]Maybe next year, guys.
[44:39.02]Last year we got a good one.
[44:40.79]We'll do like 20 next year.
[44:42.47]No, we're going to do 200 again next year.
[44:45.31]Don't worry.
[44:47.18]We'll get like 7 next year.
[44:48.54]It'll just be...
[44:51.10]Oh my gosh.
[44:52.01]The chat is freaking out.
[44:53.33]Okay, uh, let me see what time it is right quick.
[44:55.89]Okay, we got, alright, so we actually, we ended that early.
[44:57.74]We have ten minutes left before our next event.
[45:00.06]But, um, uh, Sean.
[45:02.12]Look at this!
[45:03.10]I have never seen, like, this is like a flame of a chat.
[45:07.55]It's just roasting.
[45:10.16]So, let's just scroll through the winnings here.
[45:11.64]So, this is the first page.
[45:12.96]I don't know if we want to do that.
[45:14.88]Cause, like, someone might think we got an unusual.
[45:18.68]I'm honestly pretty sure that the best thing you unboxed was the paint set.
[45:24.44]Really?
[45:25.21]This?
[45:25.79]Yeah.
[45:26.71]That, like, might be the best thing you got.
[45:29.19]Wow.
[45:29.95]I don't know, man.
[45:30.90]You got some sneakers.
[45:31.78]You got some shoesies.
[45:33.86]Oh, wait.
[45:34.34]Go back.
[45:34.74]Go back.
[45:35.12]Look at that.
[45:35.56]Look at this guy.
[45:36.42]Oh, yeah.
[45:37.37]Let's equip that one.
[45:38.39]Don't delete it.
[45:39.99]Don't buy it from the store either.
[45:41.81]Just go to the little NG.
[45:43.61]Okay.
[45:44.45]Go to the construction worker.
[45:45.34]Yeah, let's just throw it on him.
[45:46.60]Okay.
[45:47.06]This is what you guys got.
[45:48.38]Look at him.
[45:49.06]Oh, my God.
[45:50.20]He's so cute.
[45:52.80]That's it.
[45:53.32]That's all you win.
[45:54.28]So if you want to get out of this hot beard action, I think you have a few more minutes.
[45:59.15]I think you have nine more minutes to enter into this raffle.
[46:01.58]Is that correct, Sean?
[46:05.30]Uh-huh.
[46:06.06]Go on, Sean.
[46:07.03]Yes, it is, Lang.
[46:09.33]Sean's not in the mumble.
[46:10.49]That would explain a lot.
[46:11.57]Okay.
[46:12.92]Let's unequip this.
[46:15.24]In any case.
[46:15.93]That's basically better.
[46:16.91]That's better.
[46:17.63]Yeah.
[46:18.21]So I got to prep for production for the next event.
[46:21.44]So I'm going to dip out.
[46:22.92]But young Curtis will be here.
[46:24.59]I'm going to go cry.
[46:25.23]And Baylor's going to go cry.
[46:26.37]He's going to have a good little week.

[47:03.76]Alright, we're going to get the unusual that you're going to win here.
[47:12.09]Hello?
[47:14.31]Hold on, let me do this.
[47:17.44]Hello?

[47:29.16]Jesus.
[47:29.76]Okay, Fruud.
[47:30.86]Thank you, Fruud, is contributing an Australian rocket launcher.
[47:34.68]It's currently signed by WhiskerBiscuit.
[47:36.68]We can maybe get it signed by somebody else.
[47:38.93]Whoa!
[47:39.39]To the raffle.
[47:40.51]Although, I don't know if you guys know WhiskerBiscuit.
[47:42.69]He's a pretty good guy.
[47:44.35]Yeah, Whisker's awesome.
[47:45.58]But he's contributing that to this raffle as well.
[47:47.74]So if you want to enter that raffle, you have eight minutes and you have to donate a minimum of two dollars.
[47:51.94]You also will get this hat that I donated.
[47:54.72]And bam.
[47:55.61]This one's pretty.
[47:56.41]I like this one.
[47:57.81]When I got this one, I'm like, yeah, this one's pretty cool.
[48:02.34]As you can see, the unusual doesn't work.
[48:05.15]The unusual part of the unusual.
[48:06.99]I don't know what's going on.
[48:08.57]Let me join a pub.
[48:10.40]Oh.
[48:11.80]Hold on.
[48:13.08]Hold on.
[48:14.02]Hold on.
[48:15.03]The screen's going to be black for one second.
[48:16.69]I want to show you guys this.
[48:18.29]I want to show you guys this.
[48:19.45]I know what's wrong.
[48:21.27]I know what's wrong.
[48:23.26]This is very beautiful.
[48:25.10]Look at this screen.
[48:25.96]Hold on.
[48:26.32]I just want to mention that Stardust plunked down a thousand bucks.
[48:32.27]Star donated, let's see, we have a $100 donation.
[48:36.45]Jerma got a Market Garden star.
[48:39.26]Another one that says, I won.
[48:40.66]$50 that says, stop the singing.
[48:43.48]And then just now, $1,000.
[48:45.20]Kids are us.
[48:46.04]Thank you so much, Star.
[48:46.87]Can I say, dead serious, huge problem.
[48:48.81]Tried to donate $1,069.69, and it kept giving server errors.
[48:53.03]And I'm really disappointed.
[48:54.96]Huge.
[48:55.34]That is a big issue.
[48:57.06]We're looking to... Clap is for Star, chat, let's go.
[48:59.98]He doesn't suck, he's the best.
[49:01.90]Alright, we're back in game, guys, and we're going to show off the unusual that we're getting, and we'll put the Australian weapon that was donated towards this event as well.
[49:11.78]So it definitely is worth it to get in on this event for two bucks, in my opinion.
[49:16.48]Especially if you're new to TF2, you get a bunch of items and hats and paint to paint your hats and whatnot, so...
[49:23.13]Along with an unusual and an Australian weapon.
[49:26.44]Also, big shout out, LameFX is going to throw in two buds for the uncrating raffle as well.
[49:31.13]Wow, okay.
[49:32.97]Thank you guys.
[49:34.44]Making us feel much better.
[49:36.64]But the real question is, Sean...
[49:38.82]How do I get Tag's exquisite wrap?
[49:41.39]Where is that?
[49:42.83]Oh, oh, oh, there is a silent auction.
[49:44.91]I will, um, I'm going to go Nazi mod here for a second.
[49:47.53]We're going to spam the auction link.
[49:49.07]There's actually several star auctions, a Jerma auction.
[49:51.54]There's some stuff signed in by DJ Wheat.
[49:53.56]There's a Tag Unusual signed in there.
[49:55.94]And then there's a self-made key.
[49:58.38]For Mayla, I'd just like to say Tag Unusual is up to $5.50 right now.
[50:02.17]Oh, jeez.
[50:02.93]Alright, never mind.
[50:03.73]Does it come with a salt shaker?
[50:05.73]Oh.
[50:07.12]I don't have that kind of money.
[50:09.14]I can't do that.
[50:11.65]I just... I just want an exquisite random usual.
[50:15.39]You just wanna be like me, I know, I care.
[50:18.38]No.
[50:21.22]You don't have one anymore.
[50:23.40]Yeah, I do.
[50:23.80]You have a second one?
[50:27.45]My... No, that's not mine.
[50:29.29]Oh.
[50:30.93]What?
[50:31.74]No, I signed that for a person a long time ago, and they put it up for donation.
[50:36.29]Oh, I was appreciating the wrong person.
[50:38.69]My bad.
[50:39.15]No, I have an unusual that I donated.
[50:41.78]I donated an electrostatic Defiant Spartan.
[50:48.02]Shoutouts, by the way, to our boy Smacka, who just put down 50 bucks.
[50:51.77]Thank you, Smacka.
[50:52.61]We appreciate it.
[50:53.97]Star just gave a thousand.
[50:55.23]Tameka, whatever, dude.
[50:56.33]Young Dusty.
[50:57.67]Wow.
[50:58.49]Thank you, Dusty.
[50:59.57]Big Dusty.
[51:00.90]Do you have a comment for Dustin?
[51:02.86]Let me refresh.
[51:04.96]It's going to be something about me.
[51:06.90]Ashley Lang, is that Lang's mother?
[51:08.87]No.
[51:11.39]Would be my girlfriend.
[51:15.24]Yo, Steve, that's weird, man.
[51:16.70]Yo, I know, but it ain't even your real name.
[51:19.44]It's my middle name.
[51:20.78]Oh, well, I don't know.
[51:22.64]Back off.
[51:28.21]I don't see a smack.
[51:29.71]I do see a $5 donation from Raging Ster Boner.
[51:33.53]All caps.
[51:34.27]It fell all the way down.
[51:35.34]There were a lot, actually, in that one minute.
[51:36.98]11.24 and 11.25, there was like 20.
[51:40.60]Raging Ster.
[51:42.58]In all caps.
[51:45.07]Was there a comment with the Ashley donation?
[51:49.81]Yes, let me read that off for you.
[51:50.98]It says, tell Star to do it right now.
[51:53.90]I'm going to do it right now.
[51:55.48]Do it right now.
[51:56.40]I did it right now.
[51:57.32]It doesn't do it.
[52:01.75]And the comment from Smaka is... Hello.
[52:04.56]Hello.
[52:07.00]Hello.
[52:07.14]In that voice.
[52:08.06]It's hello in Lang's voice.
[52:12.95]Oh, I should probably turn the stream to a B-Rite back screen, shouldn't I?
[52:16.28]There we go.
[52:17.26]Chris, I'm going to have to fix that.
[52:20.02]We're still doing the... The Dota Fortress 2 is next, right?
[52:23.97]Yes.
[52:24.75]Yes!
[52:26.11]Let's do it.
[52:27.75]Yes!
[52:35.45]Hey, we're going to break.
[52:36.10]We'll see you in a few minutes.
[52:36.94]Coming up, the Dota Fortress 2 coming up soon.
[52:39.09]We're going to be going to that.
[52:40.36]It's going to be exciting.
[52:41.66]See you then.
[52:42.59]And remember, fake hair everywhere.
