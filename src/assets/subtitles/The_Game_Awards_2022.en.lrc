[01:32.11]Yeah, I just threw a shirt.
[01:33.75]I'm here.
[01:39.64]Did it just start?
[01:40.40]I thought it was starting like half an hour ago.
[01:42.30]40 minutes ago.
[01:52.63]This is going to dry so weirdly.
[01:57.10]Hold on a minute.
[01:58.98]Okay.
[01:59.26]Now I see why I couldn't get more than a plus one.

[02:05.89]Cool, cool, cool.
[02:06.79]Let's go.
[02:06.97]Thank you to the Game Awards.
[02:11.16]First of all, I have to thank my mama.
[02:21.51]Whose belief that I would amount to something good would never waver, even though it looked like I'd never amount to anything good.
[02:32.57]My brother, who's my hero, at 40, changed his life, went to medical school, and is now Dr. Judge.
[02:54.11]My children.
[03:01.96]Who I have been muted forever.
[03:06.08]Proud of.
[03:08.42]Forever thankful of and still the best role I've ever had is being your dad.
[03:15.61]He's phenomenal.
[03:22.36]Sony Santa Monica.
[03:30.60]Miss Yumi Yang, it is an honor and a pleasure to work for you and with you.
[03:42.43]You are a unicorn because you actually proved that for the first time ever, the trickle-down theory actually worked.
[03:55.55]Cory Barlog, thank you, brother.
[04:03.70]Thank you for believing in me and thank you for having me read for the role.
[04:15.36]I was the last actor in California to read a role.
[04:18.06]Stop touching your hair.
[04:20.36]And Corey said to me he didn't think I would do it.
[04:25.16]And if I had known it was a video game back then, I might not have.
[04:31.35]Boy, how things have changed.
[04:35.57]Matt, Rich, Dory, Bruno, Erica, Bees, everyone who made that volume so special and so sacred.
[04:57.01]Everyone.

[05:30.72]Are you so greasy?
[05:31.42]I haven't played it?
[05:32.94]I didn't play?
[05:35.92]Alright, I played the first three hours of the first one.
[05:38.97]Wait, Multiverse is one best fighter?
[05:40.91]Of course it did.
[05:41.53]Are you serious?
[06:00.42]Eric Williams is a motherfucking beast.
[06:08.82]Okay.
[06:09.94]Why do I look so smelly and slimy today?
[06:12.12]You're new.
[06:13.27]You're new.
[06:14.41]You have to be new.
[06:15.71]On kind of an artistic level, a level of that side of me.
[06:25.29]Eric Williams and I... He's always this slimy.
[06:29.91]...are from such the same place.
[06:31.89]Two different parts of the country.
[06:34.37]Two different... How are the game awards so far?
[06:37.50]I just turned it on.
[06:39.68]But two from a very similar emotional place.
[06:45.26]Make the face came bigger?
[06:47.04]And... Not right now.
[06:49.63]I'll never forget...
[06:53.60]I guess I can't say what it was, but it was something that moved me so deeply.
[07:00.05]Is it too small?
[07:01.31]And there's a time frame that cinematics have to fit into.
[07:08.97]Hopefully not speeches.
[07:14.55]Is it quiet?
[07:16.09]Reel it in.
[07:17.05]Oh, shit.
[07:17.55]What did I do?
[07:18.76]And Eric came over to me.
[07:20.44]I just muted it for myself.
[07:22.64]How did I do that?
[07:23.99]And he just hugged me and just held me as I was sobbing.
[07:36.03]And then he said words I will never forget.
[07:40.01]Okay, big guy, now give us one we can use.
[07:46.47]To this amazing, wonderful,
[07:52.32]group of actors um who brought as much or more than I did every single day why am I late I'm not I I just got here we were in there and we'll talk about something I don't want to this is a speech speech this group of actors who share their

[09:06.58]Don't be a douchebag.
[09:15.10]To every single person in this room, no matter what game it was you touched, you are heroes because you got so many people in the world through a very difficult, dark time that's still not over.
[09:29.84]Games and the gaming community mean so much to this world, so much in the course of dreams and escapism and just being better.
[09:43.26]The music is adding to the speech.
[09:49.43]That guy's awesome.
[09:59.14]Alright.
[10:00.11]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my coverage of the Game Awards.
[10:03.85]I'm here.
[10:04.25]I was a little late.
[10:05.69]We're going to give our opinions of what we see here.
[10:07.25]Okay.
[10:07.35]You can't even nominate these anymore.
[10:28.80]I'm very excited to share the global announcement of their next project.
[10:32.70]Here we go.
[10:33.46]You can't nominate this stuff anymore.
[10:34.80]I love that there's this dead zone where you guys can't nominate anything right now.
[10:42.77]Not for these awards.
[10:43.47]I'm talking about for my awards.
[10:45.21]I'm talking about for the end of the year awards.
[10:48.91]Alright, quiet.
[10:49.61]It's a cutscene.
[11:07.91]Oh, this is going to be good.

[12:11.85]I don't know.
[12:12.71]Was it?
[12:13.47]I'm sorry.
[12:15.51]Was it?
[12:16.11]It was, wasn't it?
[12:17.55]I don't remember.

[12:52.74]Oh, well.
[12:56.04]And trust me, we are just getting started.
[12:57.68]Hades 2 is the next game and first ever sequel now in development at Supergiant Games like the original, which was revealed here at TGA in 2018.
[13:05.50]Hades 2 is going to be developed in early access.
[13:07.70]So your feedback can help shape the game and news on early access is coming in 2023.
[13:10.90]Next.
[13:13.92]I'm so excited about this one.
[13:15.10]We're taking a journey to an exciting new world with a world premiere from a studio led by someone with a legacy of building incredible narrative-driven games and creating genre-defining experiences.
[13:27.31]It's moments like this that get me excited about the future of our medium.
[13:44.46]My ship is dying.
[13:49.73]And my only way out of here is with one of them.
[14:02.28]I was sailing to that distant shore.
[14:08.72]Leave her, Johnny, leave her.
[14:11.94]As the blue flowers
[14:22.20]What is it?
[14:23.92]Watch out!

[15:08.31]Like fix what?
[15:09.29]You broke.
[15:10.62]A few surprises tonight.
[15:11.70]That was a first look at Judas coming from Ghost Story Games, led by Ken Levine, who has created immersive gaming worlds like Rapture and Columbia.
[15:19.05]A few months ago, I visited the studio in Boston and played multiple hours of this game, and let me tell you, everything you saw there is in-engine.
[15:26.65]Ghost Story Games is also exploring different approaches to narrative that you will learn about in the future.
[15:31.55]Let me just say, I can't wait for them to tell you more.
[15:34.19]Didn't that look fantastic?
[15:36.52]Exciting stuff.
[15:38.49]alright well let's go to another brand is that another world premiere for the fans here at the game awards come on come on I need the Elden Ring DLC I need it I need it
[16:07.70]Is this the Bayonetta 3?
[16:11.55]I don't even know what Bayonetta they're on, guys.
[16:13.30]I have to be honest.
[16:22.18]You know, I'm of the opinion that we have to stop numbering franchises now.
[16:27.16]Yeah, Bayonetta Origins.
[16:29.16]Colon, explain the thing.
[16:30.88]Wait, what is this?
[16:32.17]Is this supposed to be Bayonetta, like, younger?
[16:51.33]Did I manage to summon a demon that is now possessed by Cheshire?
[16:58.57]Whoa!
[16:58.67]Gotcha!
[17:05.10]My dearest Cereza.
[17:07.10]Mummy?
[17:07.78]Don't worry, I'll send you home.
[17:15.26]The Colonel Demon?
[17:16.60]Avalon Forest.
[17:18.38]The White.
[17:23.96]Before she became Bayonetta... She was... Who was she?
[17:26.64]Bayonetta.
[17:26.90]Oh, she still was Bayonetta.
[17:51.41]It's not like... Barbara or something?
[17:54.10]I don't know.
[17:54.70]Bayonetta.
[17:55.60]Oh, I thought it was like before she was Bayonetta.
[17:58.12]She was this... I don't know.
[18:03.33]That's coming out soon.
[18:03.97]Okay.
[18:14.26]That's right, falling on the heels of Bayonetta 3, it won't be long until you get to play this brand new action adventure game in the Bayonetta series on March the 17th.

[19:29.30]Oh, okay.

[20:21.39]What if it's not Elden Ring DLC?
[20:22.91]But I'll shit my pants on camera if it happens.
[20:32.60]Can you imagine somebody standing up like, oh, Elden Ring got announced DLC.
[20:37.42]Are you serious?
[20:38.86]Alright.
[20:39.50]I stand up and just like, why would I want to do that?
[20:47.05]What's this?
[20:50.95]Oh, is this the, uh, the... protocol?
[21:02.11]Ballista protocol?
[21:05.49]I wanted to play this, but I heard it was kind of rough.
[21:09.59]I heard it was pretty rough.
[21:12.01]At least technically speaking.
[21:17.76]San Francisco.
[21:19.36]The city by the bay is under siege by forces not of this world.
[21:23.16]Please do it.

[22:00.22]Wait, where is that?
[22:01.14]Where is that guy?
[22:03.30]Doesn't look like he's outside of the house.
[22:05.34]One of those guys looked like they were outside the house in front of their front door.
[22:11.47]OK.
[22:19.52]You can play the quest.
[22:20.56]It's on Quest.
[22:22.82]Is it on Quest?
[22:23.76]I don't know what any of that means.
[22:26.31]Am I allowed to show this?
[22:27.69]No, I'm not IEUing this.
[22:50.07]I won't IE you this.
[22:51.85]I think it's fine, right?
[22:59.44]It's video, it's video game music in a video game, right?
[23:01.38]It's fine.
[23:04.55]I apologize for the window sound.
[23:05.75]It's so annoying and I'm such an annoying motherfucker.
[23:07.83]It's gonna happen.
[23:11.97]Three, two, one.
[23:13.96]Sorry.
[23:17.33]That seeks always its own kind The world that hardens as the harsher winter holds A parent forced to eat its young before it grows Every burden grown unheard
[23:47.38]I'll try to match it to the music.
[24:13.26]What's that device?
[24:23.95]What is that thing?
[24:28.41]Whoa.
[24:37.52]Hurdy Gurdy?
[24:39.30]That looks like a musical instrument I made up in my dream.
[24:44.63]That thing's crazy.
[24:46.93]This is good.
[24:50.11]This wind?
[25:18.56]Did this win?
[25:30.50]There's a person over here and a person over here sitting next to me.
[25:33.76]They're enjoying the music.
[25:34.68]Hey.
[25:35.48]Hey.
[25:36.52]Did this win?
[25:37.70]I don't know.
[25:41.53]Hey.
[25:42.41]Hey, dude.
[25:42.85]Hey, did this win?
[25:43.47]Fuck up.
[25:50.89]It's good.
[26:06.50]That was really good.
[26:08.08]That was like a come on.
[26:09.90]Yeah, that's what you get.
[26:10.86]That was actually very, very good.
[26:13.10]That was fantastic.
[26:20.41]Hey.
[26:21.81]Hey, John.
[26:23.15]Did you go up to the snacks thing?
[26:24.47]Can I have one of the popcorn you got?
[26:26.57]I don't feel like going up.
[26:27.41]Can I have some of the Milk Ducks?
[26:28.39]Come on.
[26:40.90]55 million.
[26:41.18]I feel like... I don't want to be moderating that Discord.
[26:42.98]Let me just be honest with you.
[26:44.24]Yeah, if you're... Oh, yeah, go discuss it.
[26:45.74]I bet you that Discord is probably...
[27:10.70]They're probably doing lots of moderation there.
[27:14.60]I don't want to alarm anyone, but someone in this room is a murderer.
[27:32.46]Just kidding.
[27:32.94]We're just joking around.
[27:33.92]But also, statistically speaking, someone in this theater probably is a murderer.
[27:38.32]I'm sorry.
[27:38.88]Let's not think about that.
[27:41.43]Anyway, I don't want to spoil our film, but I can tell you that there is a very popular video game featured in it.
[27:46.91]And now, to give you some more clues, please welcome writer-director Rian Johnson and the star of Glass Onion, Daniel Craig.
[27:56.25]Thank you, Jessica Hedgewick.
[27:58.59]And hello, Game Awards.
[28:00.78]We are so excited for you to see our new film.
[28:04.16]We have a special scene in it for fans of a certain game, so we wanted to bring a little something to that game.
[28:12.23]That's you.
[28:12.95]That's Benoit Blanc.
[28:13.57]Look at him.
[28:14.18]Look at him.
[28:14.68]He's adorable.
[28:15.44]It's a nice skull.
[28:16.84]I like the cravats.
[28:17.70]It's very, very nice.
[28:18.60]Yeah.
[28:19.30]And now, here are the nominees.
[28:22.04]This is so meme-y, isn't it?
[28:23.94]Best debut indie.
[28:25.42]Somebody's a murderer.
[28:26.30]Like, ding, ding.
[28:28.23]Oh, I got to play this.
[28:28.87]I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven.
[28:35.19]I got to play that one.

[28:47.80]Yeah!

[29:04.23]That's it.
[29:07.67]He made a whole new genre.
[29:09.45]Alright.
[29:16.11]Alright.
[29:18.10]Stray is apparently a very good game, okay?
[29:19.82]I've heard very good things about it.
[29:21.06]I'm a little upset right now.
[29:25.56]Sorry.
[29:25.90]It's supposed to be a great game.
[29:28.68]Thank you so much.
[29:29.34]It's an incredible honor.

[34:45.57]Oh, that's right.
[34:46.49]Yeah.
[34:51.47]Absolute, absolute fucking legend.
[34:54.84]After 30 years as the iconic voice of Batman in the Arkham video games, Batman the animated series, and countless other DC projects, actor Kevin Conroy sadly passed away last month at the age of 66.
[35:05.13]He was
[35:06.44]Such an iconic voice.
[35:08.38]He was so amazing in the Arkham games, and I know we're all going to miss him dearly.
[35:12.58]He was Batman.
[35:13.14]Tonight, we can share that he will return to Rocksteady's Arkhamverse one final time to play Batman in Suicide Squad, Kill the Justice League, when the game releases on May 26th of next year.
[35:24.83]That's cool.
[35:26.41]We're going to miss you, Kevin.
[35:31.41]Now, as we think about the next phase of our industry, it's important to recognize those who represent the bright, bold, and inclusive future of gaming.
[35:37.83]That's why we have our Game Awards Future Class presented by Old Spice.

[36:14.99]I was looking at the movement of NPCs in video games and realized that we as animation dancers have the unique ability to show the body control, the robotics.
[36:26.92]We have...
[36:29.88]Ability to bend time and reality among us among us is just still lighting.
[36:33.96]I think there's a lot of potential I don't think a lot of people thought that among us was gonna be still sticking around this I Didn't
[36:59.57]Where's your facecam?
[37:00.50]It's right here.

[39:24.72]There are lots of weapons.
[39:27.46]Very realistic.

[50:23.59]What is this?
[50:24.05]Is this Dune?
[50:25.85]I've never seen Dune.
[50:26.85]I've never seen the original.
[50:27.69]Guys, I don't take in any media.
[50:31.15]I just watch the same Fullmetal Alchemist intro a thousand times and then go to bed.

[53:21.32]We can't wait to see where the fun takes you next.
[53:26.60]Yes, you are consuming probably 200 to 300 advertisements over the course of these two or three hours.
[53:31.44]The whole thing is an ad.
[53:32.30]I thought that said Pornhub.
[53:37.53]It's like, oh, the Pornhub app.
[53:38.31]Oh, it's so simple.
[53:38.73]It's so easy.
[53:39.05]I was like, why is this Pornhub?
[53:39.93]The Pornhub app.
[54:13.90]What's this?
[54:14.22]I played this game on my iPad.
[54:17.40]Or I want to say two or three hours.
[54:19.28]I was so overwhelmed.
[54:20.04]I remember sitting there lying down on my back.
[54:25.79]Like this.
[54:26.25]Just being like...
[54:41.93]many things to do.
[54:42.91]I don't know.
[54:44.11]There's too many pop-ups.
[54:45.65]There's too many things happening.
[54:47.43]I have 40 sub-menus.
[54:51.01]What do I do?
[54:53.04]This looks so fun.
[54:55.78]There's so many things to do.
[54:56.82]I just got overwhelmed.
[54:57.56]I was like, I can't.
[54:58.18]It's just too much for me to even look at.
[55:02.90]It was fun.
[55:03.48]I remember just walking around and doing electricity moves and stuff.
[55:07.25]It was like, oh, this is kind of fun.
[55:08.63]I was so overwhelmed.
[55:18.70]Vampire Survivors is on iOS now?
[55:21.89]Pretty sick.
[55:33.18]That was literally the Marvel snap music.
[55:35.76]And don't ask me why I know that.
[55:37.28]That was the Marvel snap music.
[55:39.00]I played it.
[55:39.46]Okay.
[55:39.60]Get ready.
[55:40.24]You don't say get ready if it's not something huge.
[56:13.25]Is it Death Stranding?
[56:42.61]It's a Strand-type game.
[57:13.49]Why do I feel like Kojima would make a game that's just like a 500 million piece puzzle and he just releases it.
[57:36.66]It's on like PS5 store for free.
[57:42.39]And everyone just has to do it at the same time.
[57:56.82]And when it's completed, it unlocks the trailer for this game.
[58:05.57]And it might take 40 years for us to finish it.
[58:20.26]Don't worry.
[58:21.00]It's okay.
[58:24.93]Dark Souls 2.
[58:26.03]No one should have to suffer such loss.
[58:28.21]The worst one.
[58:30.99]You know, I meant it when I said I understand.
[58:33.27]Sorry, I just like pissed people off for no reason.
[58:35.23]What is that?
[59:04.26]No, this is not a SCORN-type game.
[59:06.71]Although, kinda.
[59:09.11]Kinda.
[59:15.39]It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.
[59:23.51]It wasn't the UCA that made the final decision.
[59:27.66]It was APAC, a private corporation.
[59:35.60]What is going on?
[60:02.40]Everyone, please join me in welcoming back to the Game Awards a true legend, Mr. Hideo Kojima!
[60:10.49]He just comes out with a t-shirt gun.
[60:13.65]People are like just clambering to try to get it.
[60:29.45]Aki, great to see you.
[60:31.25]Well, Mr. Kojima, it's been three years you're on this stage with us.
[60:34.71]In 2019, where you won Best Game Direction, DS2 has been announced.
[60:39.87]What can you tell us?
[60:40.73]How is it going to be different than DS1?
[60:42.01]Well, I can't tell you the details yet, but there are a lot of surprising tricks in the game.
[60:48.06]There are hidden hints in the trailer, so you can discuss them with everyone.
[60:53.62]I can't really be specific right now, but you've just seen the trailer, and I've put a lot of things inside, so I want you guys to talk about it and find details in it.
[61:03.09]Good luck.
[61:03.75]Alright.
[61:05.11]Well, I know we have some of the tasks for the game.
[61:07.39]This is a 600 million piece puzzle on a QR code in there.
[61:10.41]Go find it.
[61:12.14]Troy is here as well.
[61:13.32]We heard him there.
[61:14.30]Hello, Troy.
[61:16.16]We're so excited about this collaboration you have with an amazing cast.
[61:19.90]I wanted to ask you the story of this game.
[61:21.90]How has the pandemic and what we've been through, how has that impacted your storytelling?
[61:25.12]That's the cube from Peter Molyneux, yeah.
[61:37.69]Well, I had the story written before the pandemic, but after experiencing the pandemic, I just rewrote the whole thing, the story from scratch.
[61:47.28]I also didn't want to predict any more future, so I rewrote it.
[62:00.14]Alright, Mr. Kojima, it's always such a pleasure having you here.
[62:02.76]I wanted to ask, generally, what's next for you as a creator?
[62:05.40]I know we have our fun podcast we do, what else have you got planned?
[62:08.08]We are currently working on the DS2, but there is one more game we are working on right now.
[62:12.12]We are experimenting with the game, and we are working on the video as well, so please look forward to it.
[62:21.48]Well, yes, I'm doing the DS2 right now, and also one other title that's completely new, I'm kind of experimenting at the moment, and also other visual projects I'm still working on.
[62:30.79]So I'll hope to reveal it soon.
[62:33.49]Translating?
[62:36.25]It's such a skill.
[62:37.29]I'm thinking about this right now.
[62:41.51]If you told me in English...
[62:44.65]four or five full sentences and said, say it again.
[62:46.87]I'd go, hey, what the fuck did you even say?
[62:48.30]I'd be like, you, I can't.
[62:48.96]It's hard to do.
[62:49.40]I'll try it.
[62:49.86]Okay, I'll try it.
[62:50.28]From now.
[62:50.48]Ready?
[62:50.66]Right now.
[63:12.85]There's something here is a new pair of shoes.
[63:17.86]What did he say?
[63:18.60]Here is a new thing to present.
[63:21.76]I don't know.
[63:22.16]I don't remember.
[63:22.52]Good one.
[63:23.90]I'll try it after.
[63:44.42]you don't get it do you all you are is angry all of avium is crumbling apart you don't win in ever war you help us win this I'll know you're ready but didn't they just say you can't win you don't win here if you help us win what did I miss that
[64:27.40]Okay, I'm going to try.
[64:27.98]I'm going to try to say what... Okay.
[64:30.10]When Jeff is back on stage, I will try to do it.
[64:31.48]I will try.
[64:42.10]As an actor, I'm drawn towards stories, but I think that's true of all of us, especially those who pick up a controller.
[64:48.62]Narrative in games is a slippery thing because there's no single way to tell a story.
[64:53.13]The beginning, middle and end may not even happen in that order.
[64:57.05]And for each of us, there may be different outcomes altogether.
[65:00.05]But to be truly invested in a game story is to step away and feel as if you've lived another life.
[65:06.05]These are the nominees for Best Narrative.
[65:10.34]Our best narrative.
[65:12.10]This game was fucking crazy.
[65:13.54]I forgot to talk to you guys about this.
[65:16.54]It should be that one.
[65:39.86]That game was insane.
[65:40.68]It's that one.
[65:41.46]And the game award for best narrative goes to... God of War Ragnarok.
[65:49.10]Immortality was actually a crazy experience.
[65:52.70]I forgot to tell you about it.
[65:54.66]It actually was a really terrifying, strange, weird, wild experience.
[66:01.15]I forgot to tell you about it.
[66:02.45]Whatever.
[66:03.01]I lost.
[66:13.61]Why didn't you stream it?
[66:14.33]I don't know, because I... I felt like just sitting on the couch.
[66:19.38]Put a camera on your couch then!
[66:20.56]There are so many people, a lot of them over there, who should be on this stage with me right now.
[66:27.42]So much goes into the telling of a story.
[66:29.40]I just screamed at you, I'm sorry, by the way.
[66:31.24]From writers, animators, cine artists, level and technical designers, artists, QA programmers, audio, music...
[66:45.66]It's not just what's on the page.
[66:47.72]Obviously, our incredible cast, they elevate everything that we do put on the page.
[66:54.32]I'm honored to accept this on their behalf.
[66:58.00]I want to thank PlayStation, Scott, Herman,
[67:04.59]I want to thank, oh God, our SMS IT and facilities, the heavy lifting they had to do when we all had to shift to work from home.
[67:14.03]That's incredible.
[67:15.03]What's on the floor behind you?
[67:15.95]They're still supporting us now.
[67:17.13]It's one of Otto's toys.
[67:22.45]I'm grateful to be here.
[67:24.45]I'm grateful for your support.
[67:25.95]All the nominees in this category, you all have my undying respect.
[67:31.94]I also want to thank, obviously, Yumi, Corey, and our captain, Eric Williams.
[67:42.30]Rich and I, after Gloria stepped aside for this one, Rich and I couldn't have asked for a more supportive and incredible creative partner.
[67:51.05]And we're grateful for you every single day.
[67:54.86]Oh, I'm sorry.
[67:56.40]I also want to thank our families who went from having to see us in the morning and at night to having to see us all day every day.
[68:05.87]Why did you throw it?
[68:06.65]That's a burden I wouldn't wish for on anyone.
[68:09.79]My wife, Suzanne, my son, James, thank you very much.
[68:13.77]I love you, and I'll see you later.
[68:16.27]Immortality actually is cracked out.
[68:19.51]It's cracked out.
[68:20.46]If you have an opportunity to play it, don't look up anything.
[68:23.38]Don't do anything.
[68:24.44]Don't do anything.
[68:25.04]Just play it.
[68:25.96]And just enjoy it.
[68:26.92]Don't fucking type it into Reddit to see like, oh, what do other people say about this?
[68:30.32]Don't do it.
[68:32.62]Just play it.
[68:35.27]I know you're gonna look it up.
[68:36.95]You're gonna go, why did Jerma say immortality was a good game?
[68:41.17]Don't look, don't say that.
[68:43.01]Just play it.
[68:48.83]Jin.
[69:02.75]I used to love Tekken.
[69:18.92]I remember back in the day I used to just mash every button and it was fun.
[69:27.95]You would accidentally chain three or four moves together and your friend would go, dude, that was pretty good.
[69:33.82]You're like, yeah, I know.
[69:35.80]I know.
[69:36.92]I play.
[69:39.70]A lot of old Tekken was just each person was hitting as many button inputs as possible.
[69:44.66]And whoever pressed it more times won.
[69:49.32]That's at least what I remember when I was like, I don't know, like 14, 15.
[69:53.59]I don't know when it came out.
[69:57.54]Are you always this talkative?
[70:00.40]It's hard to shut me up.
[70:01.38]I never shut the fuck up.
[70:02.34]I'm sorry.

[74:47.91]Excuse me.
[74:49.71]Being able to play with the cloud.
[74:52.07]Sometimes, I'm telling you.
[74:53.75]I will just open up a game on the cloud.
[74:55.93]And I've never heard of it before.
[74:57.39]I might close it in fucking 10 minutes.
[74:58.81]I might close it in 5 minutes.
[75:00.56]Oh, this wasn't for me.
[75:02.54]But cool that I could play it though and try it.
[75:04.50]Move on.
[75:06.06]Sometimes I play a game for 10-12 hours.
[75:08.32]Play the whole thing.
[75:08.84]Through the cloud.
[75:11.30]Don't even have to install it.
[75:16.79]with everything in front of us.
[75:20.32]Infinite new worlds to explore.
[75:24.46]It's good.

[75:28.80]It's good.
[75:30.91]And I'm telling you Xbox, Xbox shit the bed.
[75:34.57]Last generation.
[75:36.53]They actually shit the bed like it was horrible.
[75:38.83]The Xbox One I thought was terrible.
[75:41.83]They're doing good things now.
[75:43.81]Once I get a couple of days under my belt of not vaping, I'm just going to feel better mentally.
[75:48.83]Today definitely was hard.
[75:50.24]I started vaping nicotine again because of the stressful events.
[75:54.76]I thought it was helping, but then I clicked.
[75:56.54]I'm talking about video games.
[75:57.58]It just made me feel way worse.
[75:59.18]I'm talking about gaming and peripherals and hardware.
[76:01.96]What I'm currently thinking about quitting vaping nicotine is don't be afraid to talk to someone.
[76:06.65]And if you don't have a support system, this is quitting can be there for you so you don't feel alone.
[76:12.33]I've got the Samsung 990 Pro series.

[76:30.44]The flash drive?
[76:31.22]Playing computer games?

[77:40.71]They're M.2 SSDs.
[77:42.01]Yeah, I have a regular SSD.
[77:43.75]It's not huge, but it's big.
[77:44.73]When we first started making games many, many years ago, we knew the potential was there to achieve almost anything, even to change the world.
[77:57.35]We're honored to be back here to present the award for Games for Impact, which recognizes games that change the way people think and feel about the world.
[78:10.52]Here are the nominees.
[78:14.17]Games for Impact.
[78:15.47]I swear it won't happen again.
[78:22.16]I just want to know that we can make it through this.
[78:24.62]Every cycle, you take your chances.
[78:26.77]Wake up, sleeper.
[78:33.33]It's hard not to drift into the past.
[78:43.54]And the Game Award for Games for Impact goes to... As Dusk Falls.
[78:58.68]I think this is on Game Pass.
[79:00.72]And I remember, I remember getting it, I remember opening it, and I remember being, I was really high, and I like, I just, I don't know.
[79:06.69]It was like a choose your path kind of game, like choose your own adventure type stuff.
[79:11.96]And I was like, I don't think I'm ready for this.
[79:21.88]But I was high.
[79:22.84]I don't... Sometimes I take a little bit of... You know what?
[79:25.90]We don't have to... Thank you so much.
[79:28.35]Alright, Mom.
[79:29.49]Alright, Dad.
[79:30.07]But...
[79:31.65]Forgot everything so let's improvise The game We made together with this amazing team Was like eight years in the making we really hoped this is important
[79:46.96]No an experience that was unique Narrative that was intense Grounded and also communal because as dust falls his multiplayer.
[79:57.40]I'll explain after I don't want to ruin the speech and approachable And so the story of us the spoils that presents, you know floats characters
[80:09.31]Normal people that struggle with their real life issues and are thrown in super intense pressure cooker situations and We hope that players would feel empathy for them and in the process would
[80:26.21]learn a little bit about their values, like reflect on what's important for them.

[81:41.84]People with parasites in their brains.
[81:45.56]All the way here from Baldur's Gate.
[81:50.27]You may just be the godsend we've been praying for.
[81:55.98]You're the same as me.
[81:57.92]You have a mind flayer tadpole in your brain.
[81:59.98]What is that?
[82:00.62]What is this thing?

[83:35.17]I'm here with Joe Madd, legendary comic artist and CEO of Airship Syndicate.
[83:38.91]Is it top-down?
[83:39.67]Joe, tonight you have a new title to announce, right?
[83:42.49]We do.
[83:43.15]A few months ago, we announced that we were partnered with Digital Extreme.
[83:47.43]Yes, because those games were awesome.
[83:49.32]Just a huge success over the last 10 years.
[83:51.92]And now we're going to leverage their expertise on our new game, which is a character-based online action RPG set in a brand new fantasy world.
[84:02.16]And we're super excited.
[84:03.56]I think there's a little bit more.
[84:04.70]You've got another partner to talk about, too.
[84:06.31]We do.
[84:06.89]Another partner has come on board to support us and help us reach even more players around the world.
[84:13.03]And you'll be able to play it a lot sooner than you might think.
[84:16.19]Okay.
[84:17.03]Well, let's take a look at the official announcement, the world premiere.
[84:19.61]Here we go.
[84:20.11]Thanks.
[84:29.27]The Gloom.
[84:31.56]Its arrival brought chaos.
[84:35.16]But we found a way to control it.
[84:43.14]We choose the path.
[84:49.69]We face the danger.
[84:53.29]We control the chaos.
[84:55.59]Is Baldur's Gate 3?
[84:57.11]No, no, this is a different game.
[84:58.22]I'm sorry.
[84:59.70]I was looking at you.
[85:06.28]We've all walked many paths.
[85:10.36]Sharpened many blades.
[85:13.20]Played a few tricks.
[85:16.11]Crushed a few skulls.
[85:21.29]But now, we fight as one.
[85:24.79]We are Wayfinders.
[85:40.56]Loot loot.
[85:56.53]Okay.
[86:04.44]what was the name of that uh what's the name of the game with the people floating around with the umbrellas I want to remember that I need to remember that one what's it called okay nightingale alright I gotta remember that one finally we're free
[86:32.71]We were just growing weary of each other's conversation.
[86:36.31]Lend me your strength!
[86:38.99]Don't hold this against me!
[86:40.47]I'd fight you forward to welcome you together.
[86:49.89]Let's do this!
[86:50.95]I'm on a mission!
[87:01.83]I wasn't doing that to be funny.
[87:02.67]I think it just was a little low.
[87:04.71]Joining me now are Jenova Chen from That Game Company, creators of Journey in Sky, and singer-songwriter Aurora.
[87:10.55]Welcome to the Game Awards.
[87:11.73]And Aurora, right after the show tonight, you are going to be performing a virtual and free concert in Sky, is that right?
[87:19.30]Yes, and I'm so excited.
[87:20.76]I'm sorry about my voice, it's so fucked up.
[87:22.72]There's going to be a concert in the Sky?
[87:25.64]I mean, yes.
[87:27.18]It'll be perfect in the virtual concert, though, right?
[87:29.38]But tonight it will be very good, of course.
[87:32.20]So tell us, this is an amazing collaboration working with Genova and the team.
[87:35.90]Why did you want to do this?
[87:37.20]I'm so excited about it, mostly because all of the people that are working on Sky, Children of Light and Genova, is just the best kind of people.
[87:46.41]And it feels like this project is so full of love and light and understandment of the outsiders in the world.
[87:54.83]I thought I just did something wrong.
[87:56.57]The top right was a picture in picture of this video, and I thought I broke something.
[88:00.79]Yeah, I got to experience it last week, and it really is very moving.
[88:04.21]I think it's kind of the future where virtual concerts should go.
[88:06.21]Jenova, you've always built games about connecting people, you know, relationships.
[88:10.33]I wouldn't peg you as someone that would go into the virtual concert space, but this is very special.
[88:13.67]Tell us, why did you want to do this?
[88:15.24]Yeah, I mean, historically, we always want to push the boundary of how a game can make you feel.
[88:21.31]And with our game Journey, we connect two people.
[88:24.41]But with Sky and now the upcoming concert, we want to try to see connect thousands of people together emotionally.
[88:32.36]And this is just something that I've never experienced.
[88:34.62]And to be honest, I just played it with 4,000 people this week, and I don't know what to say.
[88:41.71]So maybe we can just look at a trailer, and hopefully that will help to explain.
[88:46.89]Amazing.
[88:47.27]Let's check it out.
[88:47.89]Thanks, guys.
[88:50.03]Sky is a pretty game.
[88:50.98]From a full flower journey to Sky.
[88:53.92]What?
[88:54.06]That game company continues to push the boundary of video games' emotional potential.
[88:59.67]Can video game create a genuine human connection and bring players across the world closer, like a concert?
[89:07.30]In a real-life concert, you feel the collective energy of thousands of beautiful souls around you.
[89:14.32]You connect with the artist and their message at a personal level.
[89:20.20]We haven't felt this in any video games.
[89:23.16]And after 18 months of experimentation and development, we feel it now.
[89:29.06]We made this concert completely free so you can experience this amazing journey with your friends and loved ones.
[89:35.91]You can download on any of these platforms and take less than a minute from boot to concert.
[89:41.69]Join us for this groundbreaking moment shared by millions of players worldwide.
[89:48.62]Wasn't Journey the game where you randomly got match make and had to like take care of each other and stuff?
[89:53.96]It was incredible.
[89:54.46]It was like a crazy experience.
[89:55.34]Yeah.
[89:55.48]I played that.
[89:55.80]At PUBG?
[90:29.06]Google, what the fuck are you doing?
[90:34.59]Scary.
[90:45.44]Look, there's cars in that one.
[90:46.54]Yeah, there were cars in that one.
[91:12.31]Good afternoon, babies!

[93:38.66]Alright, alright.
[93:39.46]Everybody settle down.
[93:40.40]This is make or break it for me here.
[93:51.29]Ow.
[93:52.25]Ow.
[94:03.07]No, it's not going to be a card game.

[101:03.85]I thought they were all in the show.
[101:05.69]Wait, are they all in the show?
[101:06.83]Let's do it.
[101:09.35]Okay.
[101:11.62]We're here to present the award for best action game.
[101:16.18]Many games have action, and these are the ones that truly kick ass.
[101:21.80]This kicks ass.
[101:26.57]Here are the nominees.
[101:28.96]We got it.
[101:30.44]We nailed it.
[101:31.78]We nailed it.
[101:32.24]I haven't played it, but people tell me it was good.
[101:54.23]This was actually fun.
[101:55.01]This was very good.
[101:56.49]Highly recommend it if you haven't played it.
[102:00.49]It was a very good time.
[102:01.59]And the winner goes to... I've ruined it.
[102:06.22]Bayonetta 3!
[102:35.61]Alright, this is pretty awesome.
[102:37.73]On behalf of the development teams at Platinum Games and Nintendo that worked tirelessly on bringing Bayonetta to life for the third time, thank you so very much.
[102:50.40]It's about noon back in Japan tomorrow, and I'm sure they're watching right now, so this is for you folks.
[102:56.67]Congratulations.
[102:58.97]Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
[103:03.21]I think you all know this, but no one does action games and over-the-top action games like Platinum Games.
[103:10.21]And as you saw, they're already hard at work on their next project, so they asked me to say a few words on their behalf.
[103:19.11]With our long history of creating action games, it's a huge honor to be awarded Beck's Action Game for Bayonetta 3.
[103:26.02]We're also delighted to have been able to reveal a brand new title for the Game Awards today.
[103:30.72]We'd like to thank everyone who helped us bring the game to life, and of course, the fans of the series.
[103:36.53]With the characters just as important to the many players as gameplay, we hope you'll keep your eyes peeled for Cereza's next stories.
[103:47.15]From everyone at Platinum Games, thank you very much.
[103:49.61]Thank you.
[103:49.99]He was up there for probably 25 seconds.
[103:57.97]Congratulations to PG and Nintendo.
[104:00.27]And next, we have a trio of exciting new game announcements.
[104:03.35]First, let's head to Japan for a special announcement.
[104:14.25]In the beginning, players imagined a journey of heroism on a planet that has been in crisis for more than 1,000 years due to the spread of technology and chaos.
[104:23.50]Beyond time and space,
[104:27.34]Hello, I'm the executive producer of Bandai Namco Online Blue Protocol.
[104:33.30]I'm very happy to be able to participate in The Game Hours and introduce you to the games I've been working on with Amazon Games.
[104:49.07]I'm interested.
[104:49.65]Okay.
[104:50.19]Let's go.
[105:27.18]Do you remember what our world was before?
[105:39.21]Before the sundering.
[105:42.36]That looks pretty good.
[105:45.30]Before the war.
[105:50.37]Before the darkness.
[105:59.31]Constant conflict.
[106:26.63]There is no rest, only fireballs.
[106:52.25]Your future needs you.
[107:03.07]Looks kind of good.
[107:11.17]It's alright.
[107:12.09]I don't know what the game is.
[107:40.51]Can we see more of this game?
[107:42.19]What is this?
[107:59.56]Is it Remnant?
[108:01.00]I played a little bit of Remnant.
[108:02.00]It was pretty good.
[108:14.05]Alright.
[108:16.41]That's probably gonna be pretty fun.
[108:23.24]This ain't working.
[108:24.70]We should melt it down for ammo.
[108:29.98]And we're live.
[108:31.58]Sequencing at 17%.
[108:32.76]Loading memory core now.
[108:40.06]only the names will change and every day it seems we're wasting away
[109:05.72]I want to make a game called Constant Conflict.
[109:08.09]And even in the safe hub world, there's people just running around attacking each other.
[109:11.95]And like fireballs going off and like cars crashing into stuff.
[109:25.40]Transformers?
[109:33.10]Like, I want in cutscenes for you to be able to die.
[109:35.70]No, not QTEs.
[109:36.58]Like, you are having a conversation with another major narrative character, and there's just crazy shit happening behind you.
[109:42.99]And so it might just run into you.
[109:44.77]It's possible.
[110:08.21]Now we're going.
[110:19.10]Is the audio screwed up?
[110:29.63]We good?
[110:43.29]Oh, that was for a game.
[110:44.55]What did you think it was?
[110:45.61]I thought it was a movie or a TV show or something.
[111:16.38]The strength of your resolve is the only thing that will grant you another day.
[111:24.68]Another breath.
[111:27.52]The Game Awards?
[111:28.62]They talked about movies and TV shows.
[111:31.22]They had the whole cast of The Last of Us TV show come out.
[111:34.22]What do you mean?
[111:38.54]And soon, it will take your mind.
[111:47.97]I have found no meaning to this story.
[111:52.11]But when the end comes for you, do not yield.
[112:03.16]Emon.
[112:18.87]promising, but I'd like to see something that wasn't a full-motion video cutscene.
[112:25.19]It looked alright.
[112:26.59]I mean, I'm into it.
[112:27.69]VR, yeah.
[112:28.77]Yeah, that looks so fun, but what they don't show you...
[112:47.59]is the outside blue chaperone appearing every two seconds, the hands jiggling all over the place, and you walking into walls.
[112:56.29]And they also didn't show the character going like this every five seconds.
[113:13.39]Please welcome Keegan-Michael Key.
[113:21.02]Oh, Mario time.
[113:21.80]Pause, pause.
[113:24.70]What's happening?
[113:25.26]What happened?
[113:27.92]It is so great that we can all be here and having such a good time and celebrating tonight, right?
[113:34.29]Yes.
[113:35.89]Okay, now, alright, there is something that I would like to address.
[113:40.34]And if you guessed that it is, well, something about Toad's head,
[113:49.21]you would be right.
[113:51.11]Because I see a lot of people online saying that it's a hat, and you know what?
[113:56.83]It's not a hat, it's a cap.
[114:00.79]You see, because the cap is that top part of the mushroom that houses the spores and everything, and also, a cap... is another word for hat.
[114:14.88]I see how that, okay, I just right now saw how that could be confusing.
[114:20.15]Wow.
[114:21.69]Whether you call it a cap or a hat or a capat, I'm good with all of it because it's just part of Toad's awesomeness.
[114:32.10]So now please enjoy this clip of a few of our cracked and hatted friends in a sneak preview of their super awesome journey.
[114:40.94]The comedic timing is fucking unbelievable, by the way, so excuse you.
[114:45.30]That's a legend on stage.
[114:47.21]Excuse you.
[114:47.77]Excuse me, everybody.
[114:53.73]Coming through.
[114:54.59]Got a Big Adventure happening right now.
[114:56.63]There you go.
[114:59.01]Excuse me.
[115:00.37]Excuse me, everybody.
[115:01.77]Coming through.
[115:02.79]This guy's brother is going to die imminently.
[115:06.27]Out of the way, please.
[115:07.39]Just trying to clear a path.
[115:08.21]That's all I'm doing.
[115:09.03]He's going to be fine.
[115:10.21]Nice to see you, bud.
[115:15.24]We go
[115:44.20]Okay, so these bricks are just floating here?
[115:46.38]Just pop in this pipe and we're on our way.
[115:49.15]It's the only way to fly, man.
[115:50.85]Oh, wow.
[115:55.37]Love these pipes.
[116:09.20]Here we are.
[116:09.98]Palace doors.
[116:10.82]Big, big boom.
[116:23.87]That looks absolutely so amazing.
[116:26.08]Game time!
[116:27.14]Let's play!
[116:27.90]Let's play!
[116:28.52]Let's play!
[116:29.46]He's in the movie!
[116:30.36]Yes!
[116:30.98]I like the energy, as you can see.
[116:32.66]I'm now joined by Animal from the upcoming Muppets Mayhem.
[116:36.10]Say hi, Animal.
[116:36.62]They're recasting Chris Pratt.
[116:38.92]It's Animal.
[116:39.50]Hi, Animal.
[116:42.92]Playtime!
[116:43.66]Playtime!
[116:44.16]Playtime!
[116:44.62]Playtime!
[116:45.28]We are at the Game Awards.
[116:46.26]I love this enthusiasm, Animal.
[116:47.64]So I have to ask, what do you want to play?
[116:49.66]Do you have a certain game or?
[116:51.84]Tonnist.
[116:54.07]Elden Ring?
[116:54.75]Is that what you're trying to say?
[116:56.71]I didn't imagine you being a Soulsborne player.
[117:00.58]Do you have a favorite boss in Elden Ring?
[117:09.27]You're still thinking about her.
[117:16.08]She's pretty tough in the game.
[117:18.80]Now that I know you're such a big game fan, have you ever thought about appearing in your own game or having an animal game?
[117:24.35]Oh, yeah, yeah!
[117:25.29]Kojima!
[117:26.39]Kojima!
[117:28.55]Where Kojima?
[117:29.57]I don't know.
[117:30.15]Y'all, everyone's laughing.
[117:31.43]He's in Death Stranding 2.
[117:33.57]He's in Death Stranding 2.
[117:35.07]I'm telling you.
[117:36.65]Yeah, I guess you could.
[117:39.44]We'll talk to Hideo at the after party, see what we can make happen.
[117:42.14]There's no way Animal's not in Death Stranding 2.
[117:44.44]You had to make your own game.
[117:46.54]What would you call it?
[117:48.92]Uh... Animal Crossing!
[117:52.62]Ha ha!
[117:55.26]I think that one's taken.
[117:56.42]The Nintendo lawyers might have some issues with that.
[117:58.36]But anyways, Animal, it's great to have you here at the Game Awards.
[118:00.92]He just doesn't miss.
[118:01.48]Should we maybe give out an award now?
[118:03.02]What do you think about that?
[118:04.07]Oh, yeah.
[118:04.63]Music!
[118:05.43]Music!
[118:06.29]Music!
[118:07.25]Okay, Animal has spoken.
[118:08.71]Let's check out the nominees for Best Score and Music.
[118:12.17]Roll it!
[118:15.17]Best Score and Music.
[118:16.73]He doesn't miss.
[118:24.96]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[118:35.64]That's up there too, though.
[118:37.24]Who wins?
[118:45.69]Open, open, open!
[118:47.97]Okay, Animal, okay.
[118:50.69]And the game award for best score and music goes to...
[118:54.93]God of War, Ragnarok.
[119:05.70]God of War, congratulations!
[119:09.35]Congratulations!
[119:12.28]Wow, Animal.
[119:13.28]Whoa, buddy.
[119:14.74]My favorite drummer.
[119:16.00]I don't believe it.
[119:18.84]I literally don't believe it.
[119:21.58]Thank you so much, everybody.
[119:24.64]But I really gotta give a shout out to everybody at Santa Monica Studio.
[119:28.82]Corey.
[119:30.27]When you told me this story eight years ago, I was moved to tears then, and it's been a part of my life ever since.
[119:38.15]And Eric Williams, you really brought this out of me, man.
[119:42.73]Thank you so much.
[119:44.17]All the musicians, Ivor and Hozier, who is up here tonight, all the ethnic fiddle players and Hardinger fiddle and nickel harp, all these wonderful musicians from around the world also lent their beautiful performances.
[120:00.20]I just also want to say I've learned the power of simplicity, and Kratos is a man of few words, and I wanted to write him just a few notes.
[120:09.11]You knew it was going to be close.
[120:09.79]And I got to write... And if I only wrote that, I feel like the story would sort of be there.
[120:19.23]So I got to write a lot more.
[120:20.98]Thank you so much, everybody.
[120:22.32]This means the world to me.
[120:23.78]Thank you so much.
[120:29.02]Alright, I don't know why in my brain I thought he wrote this music.
[120:33.80]Did he?
[120:34.54]Wait.
[120:34.88]I'm confused.
[120:35.84]No.
[120:36.04]I'm losing my mind.
[120:36.64]What happened?
[120:37.10]I was reading chat.
[120:37.68]That was my own fault.
[120:55.27]You knew it was going to be tight.
[120:56.11]If a God of War game comes out, you know it's going to be close.
[120:59.84]Right?
[121:00.40]Every one of these categories.
[121:08.74]So, you're a banisher, eh?
[121:13.68]You want ghosts, right?
[121:16.74]You must have seen some strange things.
[121:31.29]We had our share.
[121:33.37]Yes.
[121:34.55]But I've never seen a ghost myself.
[121:37.76]But they are real.
[121:39.66]Right?
[121:48.71]So what?
[121:49.77]You track and kill him?
[121:50.81]Is that it?
[122:01.69]We banished them.
[122:16.55]I shall wish you a good hunt, then.
[122:25.42]It takes a brave man to walk these wilds alone.

[125:52.42]What?
[126:04.14]Okay.

[126:21.33]It's a game from 1997.
[126:22.99]Which game saw the biggest increase in viewership over the week?
[126:25.77]According to a Twitch Twitter poll, the winner was Katamari.
[126:29.09]Alright, we've got much more game awards ahead.
[126:31.61]That's a great one.
[126:32.43]I hope he comes out with a lightsaber.

[126:35.27]I know it's like licensed, but can he just come out with a lightsaber?
[126:38.74]Please.
[126:39.04]It would be so cool.

[127:45.64]But that's not an excuse.
[127:48.98]Blood Bowl is a demanding sport.

[129:08.21]I thought they would freeze frame it.
[129:19.01]What the?
[129:19.39]It's brash.
[129:33.32]Careful with the fur.
[129:34.60]I'm a little sensitive.
[129:35.58]Thank you.
[129:36.04]The remake was good.
[129:37.60]Oh, no.

[129:48.14]Zero.
[129:48.38]It's 7.30.
[129:48.56]Oh, no.
[129:48.78]Negative two.
[129:49.25]Guys, where's my crew?
[130:05.37]No, we're getting interneted out.
[130:07.59]What happened?
[130:08.87]We were supposed to meet up here and steal all the wumpa fruit from the Game Awards, which I'm now realizing was a fruitless plan.
[130:17.73]Oh, excuse me.
[130:18.89]Are you guys on mute?
[130:20.53]Oh, I get it.
[130:21.55]We're on 160p.
[130:21.99]The old silent treatment.
[130:23.69]That's fine.
[130:25.21]I think we're okay.
[130:26.37]More wumpa for me, wherever it is.
[130:30.03]Whatever.
[130:31.23]Roll the trailer, Grandma!
[131:04.75]Damn it, we almost made it the whole time too.
[131:06.63]We almost made it.
[131:14.99]Shit.
[131:15.69]No, we almost made it too.
[131:19.49]God damn it.
[131:20.03]I'm a real king.
[131:35.58]Come on, it's almost over.
[131:37.18]Now please welcome two outstanding- Here are Fuzli and Valkyrae.
[131:46.24]While gaming continues to rapidly evolve every year, if there's one category that seems to advance the fastest and furthest, it's innovation and accessibility.
[131:54.23]Each year, designers impress and inspire us by discovering new and thoughtful ways to enable an even larger audience to play their games through determined consideration for those who are often marginalized.
[132:04.55]Here are the Game Awards nominees for innovation and accessibility.
[132:09.51]Innovation in accessibility.
[132:11.09]It's a single player and multiplayer experience.
[132:13.94]We wanted to draw in people who weren't necessarily gamers.
[132:17.84]I might be able to get up there if you help me.
[132:21.86]When you are unsure of the way forward, open this book for guidance.
[132:26.85]That suite of features enables gameplay by players who are blind and have low vision.
[132:38.95]And the Game Award for Innovation and Accessibility goes to... God of War Ragnarok!
[132:50.90]God of War with the sweeps here.
[132:57.23]This is when Lord of the Rings came out.
[133:01.77]They won almost every single category.
[133:03.83]Back when Lord of the Rings but Return of the King won like 15 out of 20 categories.
[133:08.88]We are absolutely humbled and grateful to everyone who's helped us in this journey along the way because playing games is what's important for the players.
[133:17.47]It's you all, you who play the games that are really the ones that deserve this award.
[133:22.90]Everyone who was on the team at SMS, we are truly honored to be with you.
[133:26.84]Thank you so much, Eric and Yumi, for supporting us.
[133:29.76]John and Jason for being there while we were trying to make these accessibility features happen.
[133:34.46]Katie, Sam, and Zach, my closest cohorts when we were trying to make these features.
[133:39.55]And all of our team in the QA and accessibility research teams,
[133:44.49]the UIUX team, and everyone who made it possible.
[133:47.51]I can't thank you enough, and I think that the players themselves are the ones that are going to benefit the most.
[133:52.59]This is a race that no matter who wins, the player is the real winner.
[133:56.84]So let's go out there and make all games have no limits.
[134:00.12]Thank you.
[134:11.74]Welcome here.
[134:14.88]Oh wait, that's not Elden Ring.
[134:16.84]That's not Elden Ring, I'm sorry.
[134:20.82]Holy Aquarius, giver of life and light.
[134:25.02]In your divine radiance, we trust.
[134:32.85]What a child.
[134:33.85]Oh no, stop please.
[134:34.41]What a child.
[134:36.73]Eternal.
[134:45.58]Well, sorry, Elden Ring is for adults, so sorry.
[134:52.45]That argument just fell through, didn't it?
[134:54.29]May we vanquish the darkness.
[134:56.39]In light, we walk.
[135:30.48]Wait.
[135:31.84]Wasn't...
[135:50.78]Lords of the Fallen, wasn't it already a game?

[136:18.35]You see this trailer here, well, it's a little different than the rest of these trailers you're seeing tonight.
[136:24.52]This one's a little bit dangerous.
[136:27.26]So the boss wanted to come out here, make sure you don't hurt yourself sometime during the next 60 seconds.
[136:35.76]Wow, what a crowd.
[136:41.68]My God, what a night, wow.
[136:46.68]Listen, I've had some wild times.

[137:03.71]Donnie Brasco.
[137:04.65]If you haven't seen it, you should look it up, goddammit.
[137:11.30]Anyway, I have to say, being the crime boss of Rock K. City, that's a lot of fun.
[137:19.52]And we've got an amazing cast with us.

[142:09.83]Hey, take a look at that.
[142:11.65]The Samsung SSD.

[142:16.15]I have it.
[142:28.22]The 990.
[142:28.44]I thought that was an X. I was going to click the top left.
[142:29.90]I thought that was an X. The top left of this.
[143:05.51]Marvel Snap was actually pretty fun.
[143:07.21]It's quick.
[143:09.15]I feel like I can just play like an absolute asshole, like just a moron, and I can still have fun.
[143:13.47]It was fun.
[143:14.39]I don't play it anymore.
[143:15.27]I played it a little bit when, you know... I don't... That was fun.
[143:21.29]Marvel Snap was fun.
[143:29.88]Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[143:32.24]We have 900 people in here right now.
[143:33.98]How are you feeling?
[143:35.16]What's up, Kenzie?
[143:35.92]I see you out here.
[143:36.50]What up, what up, what up?
[143:37.56]My name is Michael Reynolds and I am the Fierce Diva.
[143:40.90]Where you been?
[143:42.00]So to me, what it means is just being very authentically myself and apologetically me.
[143:49.79]Mental health is very important to me for several reasons.
[143:52.63]Constantly thought that I was lesser than my peers.
[143:54.49]I just could never focus.
[143:56.11]But going through that mental health journey with my therapist, who I adore, we learned that I had ADD.
[144:00.94]It gave me a whole new perspective on my life and gave me a lot of answers that I didn't even know.
[144:05.94]God of War wins.
[144:07.36]I'm telling you, I think God of War is going to win Game of the Year.
[144:10.96]It hurts, honey.
[144:11.84]It hurts.
[144:12.12]I'm telling you.
[144:13.38]I knew that I wanted to help usher that experience for folks that really needed it.
[144:19.37]Thank you for the love per usual, the mess per usual.
[144:22.65]If I am inspiring other people to be authentic.
[144:24.69]I will give all of my energy to Elden Ring.
[144:27.41]And I don't know.
[144:28.47]Then I definitely feel good about that.

[147:32.29]So we have worked with several co-delectors, including Mr. Tanimura and Mr. Ishizaki.

[147:49.05]So we really want to share this great joy of receiving this award with them.
[147:56.21]It was great.
[147:56.83]It was just... Thank you.

[148:09.52]There was so much cool shit to do.
[148:11.24]It seemed like every single piece of that world with somebody hand made it out of clay.
[148:16.46]You know what I mean?
[148:18.42]How many times are you willing to get burned before you stop trusting someone?
[148:28.31]How many times you got to take a bullet for these motherfuckers in the name of empty promises?
[148:36.07]Politicians, military runners, intelligence operatives, all the rotten fish in one fucking barrel, this dog town.
[148:44.50]Tell me you've got a plan.
[148:46.78]Not a plan.

[149:02.11]Dogtown.

[149:04.45]It's a simple choice.
[149:08.73]Them or us.

[152:53.93]I'll take that.
[152:54.67]I'll take it over Elden Ring DLC, but it's not over yet.
[152:56.97]We don't know.
[153:00.24]People have been waiting a very long time for this.
[153:09.10]When we come back, it's time to crown the 2022 Game of the Year right here on the Game Awards.
[153:17.05]It's not ready.
[153:17.79]It's not ready.
[153:18.23]It's alright.
[153:19.45]It's not ready.
[153:20.31]Whoa.
[153:23.33]This is new.
[153:25.85]This place is the Mushroom Kingdom.
[153:30.61]Your brother has landed in the Dark Lands.
[153:32.59]They're under Bowser's control.
[153:34.82]A mustachioed human has arrived in the Mushroom Kingdom.
[153:38.60]Do you know him?
[153:39.76]Do you think I know every human being with a mustache wearing an identical outfit with the letter of his first name on it?
[153:45.48]Because I don't.
[154:03.33]I mean, Elden Ring's a big game.
[154:05.53]It's a huge game.
[154:09.51]It's probably gonna take a little bit longer.
[154:12.47]Right?
[154:14.45]There's a lot to do.
[154:15.70]There's a lot of potential story pieces they have to get correct.
[154:20.42]This is Cope.
[154:21.00]That's fine.
[154:21.46]It is.
[154:22.48]That's fine.
[154:23.32]It is Cope.
[154:24.66]It's gonna win Game of the Year.
[154:25.68]Bro.
[154:29.28]That's fine.
[154:30.14]It is Cope.
[154:30.88]It is.
[154:31.10]I'm coping right now.
[154:32.00]But it's gonna win Game of the Year.
[154:37.37]And then I'm going to give you my games of the year.
[154:39.79]I'm going to give you what I think.
[154:43.87]By the way, while I have you here, the voting for my awards, the end of the year award show, is going to be December 17th.
[154:55.05]I got an announcement of my own.
[154:56.67]December 17th is going to be the Christmas holiday show.
[155:00.65]Featuring the end of the year awards.
[155:02.57]Also, tonight, you are going to be able to vote.
[155:06.23]And yes, it is about a week and a half.
[155:08.41]It's like 10 days for this show.
[155:12.75]So if you want to vote, the poll will be up.
[155:15.07]Check my Twitter.
[155:16.27]Check the Discord.
[155:17.47]I will put it up.
[155:18.51]You'll be able to vote on all your favorite moments of the year.
[155:21.21]Or your least favorite moments of the year.
[155:23.21]Like we do.
[155:25.14]Be there tonight.
[155:25.62]Keep an eye on the Twitter.
[155:32.57]Oh, and I, uh... I might see you this weekend, too.
[155:40.32]I might see you this weekend, too.
[155:41.32]I don't know.
[155:43.96]Who knows what I could be doing this week?
[155:54.90]Delay Daniel.
[155:59.48]My computer keeps lagging, and I don't like it, and it makes me angry.
[156:05.17]Volume up?
[156:05.65]Yeah.
[156:05.89]Sorry, I just had to turn that down.
[156:07.31]By the way, here it comes.
[156:09.53]We're about to get a window sound.
[156:12.76]I will blink when it happens so you know.
[156:37.44]You can mute the window sound?
[156:39.77]Yeah, but it's like three clicks that I don't want to do.
[156:42.65]I know that's so dumb to hear.
[156:45.00]That was a look at Wild Hearts coming from Koei Tecmo and EA Originals next year, and now we welcome one of the busiest men in gaming, known fondly by his fans as Yoshi P, both the producer and director of the successful online role-playing game Final Fantasy XIV, winner of two Game Awards tonight, and producer of the highly anticipated new entry in the acclaimed Final Fantasy franchise, Final Fantasy XVI,

[157:18.33]What's happening here?
[157:19.63]What's happening here?
[157:20.71]What's this?
[157:21.15]Final Fantasy.
[157:27.82]Thank you, Jeff.
[157:38.90]On behalf of the Final Fantasy 16 team, I'm honored to be here to present you with tonight's final world premiere.
[157:52.89]To all our fans, thank you for keeping faith in us.

[158:14.59]I'm not going without you.
[158:16.63]I'm going to hold the enemy here while you make your escape.
[158:25.55]Your Highness!
[158:27.27]Run!
[158:31.63]No!
[158:32.49]Go!
[158:33.17]Joshua!
[158:52.16]Revenge is a weapon.
[159:02.47]I sometimes wonder if I am controlling it or if it's controlling me.
[159:29.23]Bad audio, Barry.
[159:32.57]Wait.
[159:42.27]No matter how bitter the truth that awaits me.
[159:44.58]I got it.
[159:44.84]I got it.
[159:46.16]I will press on.
[159:54.46]Good boy.
[159:57.00]What do we do?
[159:57.82]The usual.
[160:04.03]Very cool.
[160:34.14]Final Fantasy 16.
[160:39.19]Wait, it's a PlayStation 5 exclusive?
[160:42.33]Oh, the other ones were, weren't they?
[160:43.51]Here we go.
[160:44.91]Don't, my internet, please don't crash.
[160:46.38]This is important.
[160:59.40]Yeah, really nice being on stage again, actually.
[161:01.88]It feels really good.
[161:03.20]I know a lot of people are nervous, but don't be.
[161:05.82]I'm going to be super cool and short.
[161:07.98]So, let's see now.
[161:11.06]Yeah, I remember recently, last year, winning Game of the Year.
[161:14.68]It's a fantastic feeling.
[161:16.80]Obviously, as a nominee, you should be very happy and very proud, but trust me, you do want to win because it's a great feeling.
[161:24.55]But, however, you do actually win something at the Game Awards.
[161:27.74]They're super cool, because, you know, this beautiful orchestra, when they play the music from your game, I mean, I was sitting over there, and trust me, the hair on my body was all over the place.
[161:38.14]No.
[161:39.46]Goosebump, I mean.
[161:40.68]It's really awesome.
[161:41.74]So, please, give a big applause to the beautiful orchestra, and conducted by Lon Babb.
[161:52.90]Oh, we're gonna get, alright, this is huge.
[161:54.82]This is huge.
[162:45.19]Wow, look!
[162:45.83]Hey, look!
[162:56.62]Holy shit!
[163:03.93]Come on, Internet, you just have to get through the next five minutes!
[163:16.70]Oh shit!
[163:24.08]Please!
[163:26.56]Please, I just want my internet to work!
[163:38.77]I'm telling you right now, if this doesn't work out, I'm gonna be fucking furious.
[163:48.67]Come on.
[164:13.09]The earthquake is happening.
[164:19.29]Come on, man.
[164:31.96]He's losing his mind.
[164:40.97]What did I say?
[165:15.75]Who wins the game of the year?
[165:38.17]Goosebump, I told you.
[165:41.15]Alright.
[165:42.57]Game of the Year winner is... Eldery!
[165:49.16]They won!
[165:51.32]They did it!
[165:52.58]They did it!
[165:54.30]They did it!
[165:56.28]They won!
[165:57.31]Yes!
[166:22.49]dude somebody somebody said you are so unfunny I'm so sorry that you hate me I'm sorry thank you so much
[166:41.05]People are strangling each other in that Discord.
[167:03.58]I would like to share this great appreciation with our entire Erdending team members, everybody at FromSoftware, our partner, Banda and Amco, all collaborators, and last but not least, Mr. George R. Martin, who created the great Mythos for this game.
[167:21.99]Now, all jokes aside, it was actually probably
[167:26.26]I mean, I don't think an experience will come out for a while.
[167:28.57]I can match that.
[167:30.25]It'll be a while.
[167:30.65]A lot of good things did come out this year though.
[167:48.58]We have faced so many difficulties while developing this game, so as a director, I'm really relieved.
[167:55.42]And this might not be the light thing to say on the occasion of receiving the Goaty Award, but I have made up my mind to create even more interesting games than this one.
[168:16.71]As for Elden Ring, we still have several more things we want to do, so getting this Goldie Award really, really encourages us.
[168:41.12]You can't vote for that.
[168:44.47]You can't vote for the shitting my pants when Elden Ring wins.
[168:48.81]The poll is closed.
[168:49.69]Thank you very much.
[168:50.59]Thanks to all of you, we, or I, have been able to make the games we want to make with all our might.
[168:56.25]Thank you very much.
[168:57.90]I'm very happy to be able to contribute to game production in this age.
[169:03.50]Thank you very much.
[169:11.14]And finally, we would like to express our utmost gratitude to all the fans who played, who enjoyed, and who supported these titles.
[169:21.68]It was that bad?
[169:23.72]And we create the games we want to create and do our best because of you.
[169:28.83]Thank you so much.
[169:29.85]Thank you.
[169:36.55]Hey, Martin.
[169:38.31]That was actually deserved.
[169:39.49]I want to thank everybody and say that I think I want to nominate this award to my reformed Orthodox Rabbi Bill Clinton.
[169:48.33]Thank you, everybody.
[169:55.26]What was...
[169:57.29]Alright.
[169:57.81]What's happening?
[169:58.30]Well, the Betful evening, congratulations.
[170:01.42]This has been such a special night, and I can't believe that next year, 2023, marks the 10th annual Game Awards.
[170:08.28]So we are lucky to do this every year, and we want to thank all the industry for their support, and of course, all of you around the world, viewers of the show.
[170:15.44]Tonight, I do have one last special announcement from us.
[170:18.49]To celebrate our 10th year, The Game Awards is thrilled to be partnering with the LA Phil for a very special evening of video game music performed live at the world famous Hollywood Bowl next year on June 25th, 2023.
[170:33.25]We'll be celebrating the past decade of video game music and looking ahead to its future.
[170:37.96]You'll be hearing much more about this historic collaboration early next year.
[170:43.14]Until then, thank you so much.
[170:44.56]Have a safe and happy holiday season, and we'll see you in 2023.
[170:49.43]Good night, everybody.
[170:50.39]Very cool.
[170:52.25]I need to examine something really quickly, though.
[170:54.67]My internet's a piece of shit right now, but I need to see just how bad this was if I allow it into the awards, which I'm not going to.
[171:02.84]I'm not going to, but I need to see how bad it was.
[171:15.63]have to allow no I can't I can't do that alright there's some pretty cool stuff this year first of all Vampire Survivors I think is probably top three in game of the year I think wait what did I even say you're a man of your word what did I say goosebump I told you wait let me I gotta put it on stream
[171:51.14]Let's examine this.
[171:53.50]Goosebumps.
[171:57.98]Okay.
[171:58.08]I'm gonna go away for a second.
[172:01.17]That was scary.
[172:03.13]That was scary.
[172:06.45]You can see I'm getting ready to press the button.
[172:08.51]This is... This motherfucker right here is about to press the fart button.
[172:13.75]Those are... I'm pressing the fart button.
[172:15.57]Eyes.
[172:18.22]Goosebumps.
[172:18.82]I told you.
[172:21.21]Alright, game of the year, winner is... Eldery!
[172:29.20]They won!
[172:36.24]The fact that it was that one, I couldn't even hear it.
[172:42.74]Everything was so loud.
[172:44.32]I just clicked on the first one.
[172:47.44]Fart sound effect.
[172:48.52]I'm sorry.
[172:49.82]I'm really sorry.
[172:50.42]That was naughty.
[172:51.26]They won!
[172:52.98]They did it!
[172:57.76]They did it!
[172:59.87]I'm sorry.
[173:00.29]I can't put it in the awards.
[173:12.35]Why would somebody do that?
[173:15.69]Imagine you're watching this with a bunch of friends.
[173:19.44]You're in... It's like five or six of you on the couch.
[173:23.58]And one of your friends is just like, Dude, oh man, if Elden Ring wins, I'll shit my pants.
[173:30.26]That's so funny.
[173:31.28]You're such a goofy guy.
[173:33.67]What a character that guy is.
[173:36.35]And then the announcement of Elden Ring happens, and this motherfucker does this.
[173:41.77]I'm out of here.
[173:52.16]I'm leaving.
[174:00.23]Well, that was the game awards, but I do have to tell you who I think should have won, right?
[174:05.23]You're a coward.
[174:06.33]It's fecal funny.
[174:07.74]I...
[174:13.72]It's so childish and it's not, it's so, it's such a basic joke to make too.
[174:21.09]Anyways.
[174:21.81]Oh, so, oh, I think that, um, Vampire Survivors was a good game this year.
[174:27.37]I also think that Elden Ring was better.
[174:29.43]One or two, I think.
[174:31.35]Yeah.
[174:31.63]How do I, what do I even do?
[174:32.57]How do I go from here?
[174:35.34]Elden Ring.
[174:38.12]Vampire Survivors.
[174:44.28]What else did I say?
[174:52.90]It was three.
[174:59.71]Scoring didn't win anything.
[175:03.19]Yeah, I know my internet's a mess right now.
[175:07.29]But thanks for watching that.
[175:08.19]Sorry I was late.
[175:09.33]I've been doing a lot of shit.
[175:10.35]There's a lot of stuff going on.
[175:11.23]I will see you
[175:13.78]This weekend, maybe just follow my Twitter.
[175:16.92]I would follow the Twitter if you don't.
[175:18.76]Grotto Beasts is so close.
[175:21.27]Christmas show is coming here.
[175:23.75]17th of December.
[175:25.07]It's going to be great.
[175:25.67]There's a lot going on.
[175:26.49]Been working a lot.
[175:29.61]Been trying to get some of this stuff ready.
[175:32.09]poll for the award show will be live tonight so if you want to vote on that there's a lot I will say that um it's always funny to go through the nominees and uh because like and huge shout out to the mods too the mods did so much this there was so many submissions and then obviously me going through them too did you know have to narrow them down
[175:55.95]But it's always funny to do these because when you have something like best impression and worst impression, the best impression category had, you know, 10 to 15 nominees.
[176:09.64]The worst impression category had like 110 after, you know, the first few passes.
[176:16.12]So trying to... Worst Noise, I think, had like 70 nominees.
[176:22.49]Even after going through it a few times.
[176:24.33]But
[176:25.35]It's in a place where it looks pretty good.
[176:29.69]So you'll see it.
[176:31.44]Take your time on it.
[176:32.16]You've got eight or nine days, ten days, which just doesn't sound like a lot of time because it's not.
[176:36.60]I'll see you soon.
[176:40.68]Thanks for watching.
[176:41.30]I'm going to go.
[176:41.74]My internet sucks.
[176:43.21]I was thinking about changing over to like Frog Detective, but it's a mess right now.
[176:48.09]Past 7.30, 8 o'clock.
[176:49.53]That's why I've been streaming earlier.
[176:57.98]But yeah, I will see you next time you will see me will be this weekend.
[177:04.60]I'll see you.
[177:05.64]You'll see.
[177:08.14]I'm sure you'll see it.
[177:08.76]It'll probably get announced soon.
[177:10.46]Maybe I'll announce it on Twitter.
[177:12.44]Follow the Twitter.
[177:13.26]If you don't, follow my Twitter for, you know, just when I go live tweets and sponsor ads.
[177:23.73]Sometimes I read my drafts.
[177:25.67]So that's good.
[177:29.38]Alright.
[177:31.78]So let's raid.
[177:33.04]Let's raid somebody.
[177:33.56]Who are we raiding?
[177:33.96]Let me see who's alive.
[177:36.57]Thanks for watching, though.
[177:37.21]It's always fun to do this.
[177:40.01]A lot of great games this year.
[177:40.95]I got to play God of War.
[177:41.91]I have to.
[177:43.01]I feel like God of War is one of those games where you got to play it to get it, right?
[177:48.56]It's like, oh man, it's God of War one, like seven categories.
[177:52.36]Like what the fuck?
[177:53.10]But I've never played it.
[177:54.00]I'm sure I probably would feel pretty strongly about it if I played it.
[177:58.24]I've played the first one a little bit.
[177:59.37]It's amazing.
[178:00.61]The first two or three hours of that game is what I've experienced.
[178:02.85]Maybe a little bit more.
[178:03.73]It was awesome.
[178:04.95]I don't know.
[178:06.25]I don't know.
[178:08.06]Alright, where we going?
[178:09.54]Who's live?
[178:10.10]Let's see.
[178:10.44]I'm gonna pick somebody here.
[178:14.78]Who is currently live?
[178:33.89]Oh, Dwarf Fortress!
[178:34.75]Is that game good?
[178:42.15]I've seen people playing it.
[178:42.81]Etalyx is playing it right now.
[178:51.23]Should I just dump you guys on Etalyx?
[179:00.54]Yeah, let's go.
[179:01.00]It's been a while since you were rated Etalyx.
[179:04.38]Go say hi to Etalyx.
[179:05.63]He's playing Dwarf Fortress.
[179:10.91]Be good.
[179:11.33]Be nice.
[179:15.85]Be good.
[179:16.51]Be nice.
[179:20.05]But yeah, I'll see you guys this weekend.
[179:21.23]See you later.
[179:24.52]Go say hi to Etalyx Dwarf Fortress.
[179:29.26]I'll see you guys soon.
[179:30.58]Take care.
[179:31.02]See you later.
[179:31.56]Goodbye.
[179:32.26]Sorry for that.
[179:33.58]It's not worst joke of the year.
[179:35.54]This is in the zone where you can't nominate things.
[179:39.68]I'm sorry.
[179:43.10]Good night, guys.
[179:43.48]See you later.
[179:44.65]I'll see you this weekend.
[179:45.57]Oh my god, that's a lot of subs.
[179:58.20]Holy shit.
[180:00.52]That's actually a ton of subs.
[180:02.02]How many subs came in today?
[180:07.80]Well, thanks guys.
[180:08.42]Appreciate it.
[180:15.31]The next time I will be live on my channel, that's actually a good point.
[180:19.21]The next time I'll be live on my channel will be probably the, I want to say, maybe Tuesday the 13th?
[180:31.03]Wednesday the 14th?
[180:35.21]We'll do a couple of things.
[180:38.37]And I will tell you this, I want to make sure this is clear too.
[180:40.81]Once some of these shows are done, especially the Christmas one, there's a lot happening with the Christmas, a lot going into it.
[180:48.93]So once the Christmas show is done, we're going to get back to normal here.
[180:52.49]We'll do some, I'll make sure to, it's been kind of erratic the last couple months, I'm aware of that.
[181:00.29]Oh fu- Shit!
[181:03.12]Nevermind!
[181:04.34]Everybody's gone!
[181:08.28]Well, see you later!
[181:10.24]See you later!
