[00:00.05]Alright, I'm just getting it set.
[00:02.83]Hold on.
[00:05.39]I'm in my, like, pajama pants and, like, I don't even care.
[00:08.62]Let me just get this shit going.
[00:11.62]I got the long cord.
[00:12.78]Don't worry, we can set it up correctly this time.
[00:20.29]Everything's gonna be fine.
[00:25.73]My room's a mess.
[00:27.63]And, like, look at all this shit.
[00:28.75]Hold on.
[00:29.09]I'm just gonna turn the fucking... Oh, boy, this is gonna be bad.
[00:32.77]This is not gonna be good.
[00:36.32]Oh, yi-yi.
[00:39.68]The camera has to be in the right spot, too.
[00:41.72]This is not good.
[00:44.86]What a fucking D-I-S-A-S.
[00:48.04]Disass.
[00:49.06]What a disass.
[00:49.74]You know what I mean?
[00:51.34]What a disass.
[00:54.64]Has anybody seen any good movies lately?
[00:56.34]Anybody seen any fucking good, like, flicks?
[01:01.58]Anybody seen any flicks lately?
[01:02.86]Cool.
[01:08.33]I saw a flick the other night.
[01:10.47]I saw It Comes at Night.
[01:13.29]Cool.
[01:14.43]Yeah, pretty cool, I guess.
[01:17.35]Yeah, it was cool, I guess.
[01:20.93]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
[01:24.26]Short chord.
[01:25.08]Fuck.
[01:27.08]Just gonna plug in the camera.
[01:29.76]And then, like, we're gonna play VR, I guess, for a little while.
[01:36.35]Fucking mess.
[01:36.97]I just wanted to play Red Dead Redemption, and we're here just, like, fucking being dickheads on stream for, like, fucking two hours.
[01:46.72]What a fucking pain in the ballsack.
[01:49.68]Alright.
[01:51.02]I'm going to be here in a second.
[01:52.66]Don't worry.
[01:53.14]I'm going to play Job Simulator.
[01:57.09]So I wonder if it was good.
[01:58.93]Well, that's good.
[02:02.51]How the fuck am I going to get you to stay here without moving?
[02:05.39]That's a great question.
[02:10.87]I wonder if I can just get it plugged in.
[02:12.15]Ugh.
[02:13.71]Ugh.
[02:20.43]Don't worry, I'm like, I'm clothed tonight.
[02:22.41]At least I have clothes on.
[02:23.45]Is this thing even plugged in?
[02:34.94]Is this thing working?
[02:38.60]Alright.
[02:39.56]Let's try it.
[02:44.04]It's gonna be like a picture of my desk.
[02:45.85]Oh, goodness.
[02:51.51]Ow, fuck, my hands.
[02:52.89]Okay, well, that just can't move from there.
[02:55.23]And then we'll be fine.
[02:59.29]Turn this on.
[03:00.99]Boink.
[03:01.95]I think I need to plug in one more thing.
[03:03.79]I do this stupid fucking cable.
[03:07.42]Where does this even go?
[03:09.78]Fucking PlayStation.
[03:11.42]Alright, I'm going to lose you for a second, maybe.
[03:29.19]We can't do it.
[03:29.99]We can't.
[03:30.47]I gotta turn the stream off if I'm gonna be able to do this.
[03:37.46]Give me a second.
[03:39.06]Give me a second.
[03:42.90]Give me a second.
[03:45.14]We have to... I'm sorry, guys.
[03:47.02]I'm sorry.
[03:50.03]I can't do it.
[03:50.65]It's not going to work.
[03:51.29]I have to turn the whole fucking stream off and like plug it.
[03:53.65]There's like a lot of things that have to be done for you to do VR.
[03:57.55]So we're going to do something else.
[03:59.55]And like this has been a fucking nightmare the last like two hours.
[04:04.83]I'm so sorry.
[04:06.27]But here we go.
[04:09.41]We're going to play something on Steam.
[04:10.55]Like I just can't.
[04:11.43]It's not going to work.
[04:12.09]I'm going to be real.
[04:16.36]Give me one second.
[04:28.86]Jerma disappoints us all.
[04:30.72]I should fucking rename the stream too.
[04:32.42]Really.
[04:39.37]We're gonna play a fighting game.
[04:42.65]We're gonna play a fighting game.
[04:44.57]Happy fucking Friday.
[04:46.73]I am fucking upset right now.
[04:49.54]There it is.
[04:50.30]I don't even care.
[04:51.42]Here we go.
[04:53.27]It has to happen at this point.
[04:55.49]I'm going to turn my fucking facecam on.
[04:57.81]The PlayStation is still on.
[04:58.87]Look at this fucking hair.
[05:01.41]The PS4 is still on.
[05:03.11]I don't care.
[05:03.87]It's going to take too much.
[05:04.99]It's too much.
[05:08.68]Okay.
[05:11.80]We're going to play this.
[05:16.00]If it works.
[05:17.84]If it does work.
[05:19.66]Which it might not.
[05:20.40]Because nothing fucking works.
[05:22.20]When I try to do something, it doesn't work.
[05:24.20]That's just my mantra at this point.
[05:33.56]This should work.
[05:34.84]And it does.
[05:35.90]Okay.
[05:37.50]Alright.
[05:39.38]We're going to play this fucking game.
[05:44.42]I'm going to change the title.
[05:52.04]What's the name of this dumb game?
[05:55.30]Stay Dead Evolution.
[05:56.80]It doesn't even exist on Steam.
[05:59.17]Stay Dead.
[05:59.95]That's fine.
[06:02.67]Stay Dead.
[06:07.07]I can't change the title.
[06:10.19]For some reason.
[06:11.27]It will not let me change the title.
[06:13.65]I don't know why, but it won't.
[06:17.93]So let's just go ahead and kill the PlayStation.
[06:27.88]No Mountain.
[06:28.46]It pretty much is a virus game.
[06:30.62]You're right.
[06:31.08]It is.
[06:40.53]There was a problem editing my status.
[06:42.09]Why can't I edit my Twitch status?
[06:46.75]I can't even edit my Twitch status?
[06:48.58]There's an error on my Twitch status.
[06:51.30]What a disaster.
[06:52.54]Whatever.
[06:53.22]Apparently I'm still playing Red Dead.
[06:54.66]Let's go.
[06:58.61]We're gonna- empty slot, load it, let's go.
[07:04.04]It's a stay-dead evolution.
[07:12.59]Bad luck stream, and that's just the way it is apparently.
[07:18.65]Hope you guys are fucking ready for this game.
[07:28.31]Why can't I change my status on Twitch?
[07:32.30]I don't understand.
[07:37.74]Whatever.
[07:38.08]Let's go.
[07:38.44]Let's play.
[07:39.86]Mobile.
[07:40.40]Modern days.
[07:47.18]Stay Dead Evil.
[07:48.04]Is this an FMV fighting game?
[07:50.02]Yes, it is.
[07:51.26]Yes, it is.
[07:53.63]I'm sorry that this is what we had to come to.
[07:58.33]But this is where we are.
[08:06.57]We came to this, guys.
[08:07.87]I'm so... I'm sorry we came to this.
[08:14.17]But we came to this.
[08:15.57]It's a fighting game.
[08:16.58]It's a fucking fighting game on the PC.
[08:18.52]And it's a fucking full motion video fighting game.
[08:27.75]I'm gonna move this way.
[08:29.35]I'm gonna move.
[08:29.89]This is part of, this is supposed to be part of my, like, FMV dog shit games.
[08:35.03]And we're, like, already here.
[08:45.48]You're too good for this foe?
[08:47.88]Humiliating victory.
[08:49.10]Okay, we won.
[08:50.68]I gained a life point and I unlocked a triple combo.
[09:03.04]What do you want me to do?
[09:04.39]What do you want me to do?
[09:05.07]I'm stuck.
[09:07.99]I'm stuck in this mode because like things just didn't fucking work.
[09:20.57]I'm fighting like Psycho Mantis right now.
[09:24.02]Oh, nice duck.
[09:24.68]Nice spider duck.
[09:31.48]You know, I will admit when I'm wrong, this is bad.
[09:33.64]This is real bad.
[09:34.74]This is not good.
[09:40.71]This is actually worse than Red Dead Connection speed problems.
[09:57.86]Did this cost?
[09:58.46]It did cost me money.
[10:00.60]It did.
[10:04.95]Red Dead connection.
[10:09.79]I'm about to do something drastic.
[10:13.99]Give me a second.
[10:15.96]Hold on.
[10:23.02]I'm about to do something drastic.
[10:30.12]At this point, like, I don't even... You, like, tapped me right in the chin.
[10:37.43]Oh, boy.
[10:39.25]This is a bad acting class.
[10:44.18]Did I really download and buy a bad acting class?
[10:51.12]I did, didn't I?
[10:53.22]Guys, I didn't think I got a bad acting class on Steam, but I did.
[11:01.05]I'm still gonna win, though.
[11:02.97]Like, I have no idea what the fuck is going on.
[11:05.06]I have not a clue.
[11:06.12]But I'm going to win.
[11:08.20]I'm gonna beat this guy.
[11:08.88]And this is, like, a hard guy.
[11:09.94]You can tell because he has tattoos all over his face.
[11:20.49]Nice block.
[11:22.29]Up into the ba- No.
[11:23.57]A bad breaker, apparently.
[11:24.67]He's gonna hit me.
[11:25.22]I'm dead.
[11:29.94]Am I the only person that bought this?
[11:31.50]Probably.
[11:31.96]I'm so sorry.
[11:50.25]I'm so sorry.
[11:54.65]What am I supposed to do?
[11:55.77]I'm in a fucking situation.
[12:01.65]You see the situation I currently got myself into?
[12:05.25]And now buttons don't work.
[12:08.85]That works, though.
[12:15.82]I don't have the movies installed on it.
[12:17.32]I would.
[12:17.76]The movies is not on this computer.
[12:22.34]There are 14 reviews of this game on Steam.
[12:25.36]Are they all negative?
[12:27.11]I hope they are.
[12:31.19]This is some, like, martial artist thought this was, like, fun to do this, like, for, like, an hour.
[12:36.07]He got, like, two of his friends, painted his fucking face, like, a bunch of weird colors.
[12:39.83]Oh, my God.
[12:53.68]Get me out of here.
[13:08.08]My face is just sitting there.
[13:11.02]I'm just sitting there like... So angry.
[13:36.45]Hi guys.
[13:38.84]You know, sometimes we stream.
[13:41.42]Sometimes we stream games.
[13:54.77]Minecraft?
[13:55.59]I'm not gonna fucking open up Minecraft.
[13:57.70]I don't have Minecraft installed.
[13:59.50]I don't have that game INSTALLED.
[14:08.43]Let's go play Peggle.
[14:09.90]That's really all I got.
[14:11.52]I'm sorry.
[14:17.50]What do I have installed?
[14:18.50]That's a fucking great question.
[14:20.12]Like, I'm so done right now with, like, just everything.
[14:27.61]Ugh.
[14:27.69]Is there a game where you can play like a cockroach?
[14:39.30]That's not going to be fun.
[14:42.19]We can play Contradiction, which is that video mystery murder game which people thought was fun.
[14:58.29]Stay Dead Evolution?
[14:59.26]I can't.
[15:02.20]Oh, I'm so angry.
[15:06.82]Contradiction is an investment, is it?
[15:09.83]I don't know much about the game.
[15:13.70]You wanna be the cockroach?
[15:15.08]I don't know how to-
[15:44.09]Where the fuck is game capture?
[15:45.47]Just let's open it.
[15:48.19]Let's open it.
[15:49.69]What's the worst that's gonna happen?
[15:52.05]I've already embarrassed myself on stream enough today for fucking two hours almost.
[16:10.80]I got a lot of random shit that has to be deleted.
[16:18.79]Is this working?
[16:25.88]It's not, so let's try this.
[16:31.16]Fucking hell.
[16:36.32]There it is.
[16:54.26]I just wanted to play Red Dead.
[17:00.52]Baza Gaza, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[17:02.82]I can't go to sleep knowing you paid money for that game, so have some bits.
[17:07.99]Oh, God.
[17:09.31]Thank you, Baza.
[17:10.63]Hope all is well.
[17:12.99]Illvery, thanks for the bits as well.
[17:14.81]Jerma, please do me a favor.
[17:15.71]Stop apologizing.
[17:16.77]These problems were out of your control and the fault of the companies.
[17:19.39]You're doing great, and while worrying about your community is a sign of dedication, we do not blame you.
[17:24.26]I can happily say I enjoyed tonight's stream and what you've made of it.
[17:26.88]Sorry.
[17:27.94]Well, Ivory.
[17:30.34]Look, listen.
[17:31.78]Listen, this is important.
[17:32.80]I'm going to go off on like a Jerma reel talk here because it has to be said.
[17:40.48]We're gonna get real big on this.
[17:42.66]We're gonna get real big.
[17:43.84]You know what I mean?
[17:46.73]Oh, shit.
[17:47.35]Hold on.
[17:47.63]Where'd it go?
[17:50.83]So... I want you to be fucking entertained, okay?
[17:55.51]I want you to be happy.
[17:57.13]And if that means... If that means...
[18:04.09]Oh, what a stream.
[18:05.59]Hey, did you go to that guy Jerma's stream?
[18:08.77]I popped in for a second.
[18:10.11]He's a fucking turd.
[18:12.15]He had like a full fucking screen facecam and I like wasn't impressed.
[18:16.71]Don't ever link me this person ever again.
[18:19.08]It's getting fucking bigger.
[18:30.90]You know what I mean?
[18:38.49]I get disappointed.
[18:39.27]I do.
[18:40.31]I do.
[18:40.79]It's true.
[18:41.41]I get disappointed when things don't go correctly and I have problems.
[18:46.87]But, you know, this show must go on.
[18:48.45]You know what I mean?
[18:51.65]I get good dental.
[18:53.09]Yeah.
[18:53.71]I get real good dental at my job.
[18:57.72]Ding!
[19:01.44]Oh, Xbox controller.
[19:02.62]You see that?
[19:03.32]A-A-B-Y.
[19:06.14]Get me...
[19:17.00]Wait, wait, wait And the people that like come into the stream that have no idea what the fuck I'm doing gonna be real confused
[19:44.06]My name is Jenks, Detective Inspector Frederick Jenks, and I've been assigned to a last-minute investigation into the death of Kate Vine, a PhD student found drowned at midnight last Friday in a lake in the woods on the outskirts of the tiny village of Edenton.
[20:01.63]I have until first thing tomorrow morning to decide whether her death was a simple accident or whether this was murder.
[20:09.78]Kate Vine appeared to the world to be a bright, confident, fun-loving PhD student with everything to live for.
[20:16.70]However, a history of depression and alcoholism revealed in her medical records suggests that in reality, she had become adept at hiding behind a mask.
[20:26.44]A lab report indicating a high level of alcohol in her blood, along with the late hour of her death and a lack of witnesses, makes a strong case that this was suicide.
[20:36.75]But the verdict overlooked some curious details.
[20:39.83]Why was her driving license found on the opposite side of the lake in which she drowned?
[20:45.15]Also, there were traces of morphine in Kate's system.
[20:48.51]Where did she get it?
[20:49.98]Kate was known to be a free spirit with a nihilistic love of danger, which may in part have something to do with a business course called Atlas, which Kate had joined and which she had been attending on the night of her death.
[21:02.15]Based in a large stately home on the outskirts of the village, the exclusive Atlas is run by father and son team Paul and Ryan Rand.
[21:10.82]Both were interviewed following Kate's death, but neither claimed to have seen Kate after the meeting, and both were understandably eager to distance themselves and Atlas from the tragedy.
[21:21.76]This isn't the first time that Atlas has been investigated.
[21:24.79]Atlas and their questionable methods, which many have suggested border on mind control.
[21:31.09]Oh, mind control.
[21:32.05]That's where we're getting real weird.
[21:32.99]Ryan is married to Rebecca, landlady of Edenton's village pub, the George and Dragon.
[21:37.12]As yet, she hasn't been interviewed, though it's likely Kate visited the pub on more than one occasion.
[21:43.52]One of Kate's friends was Emma Bowman, who lives at Eden Lodge on the road leading out of Edenton Village.
[21:49.81]Emma was also doing a PhD at the same university, but didn't attend Atlas.
[21:54.83]Interviewed after Kate's death, Emma seemed shocked and upset, insisting she hadn't seen Kate that night.
[22:00.67]However, it turned out her boyfriend had.
[22:03.83]Simon Thompson met Emma at university.
[22:06.17]What are they saying?
[22:06.79]I don't know.
[22:07.15]After completing his degree around 18 months ago, he went to work at a shop in the neighboring village.
[22:11.63]He started at the Atlas course a few months ago.
[22:14.45]Simon insisted that he didn't see Kate after the meeting.
[22:18.20]What the fuck?
[22:19.16]I haven't paid any attention.
[22:25.06]Oh, God.
[22:25.62]What an investment.
[22:28.82]I know this isn't Red Dead Redemption.
[22:30.54]You're right.
[22:31.08]I need to change that immediately.
[22:35.08]What is this game called?
[22:36.00]Contradiction.
[22:40.11]No, not Contraption Maker.
[22:42.11]Contradiction.
[22:46.63]This is not the right game.
[22:48.19]By the way.
[22:48.69]And I can't edit my status.
[22:51.88]Twitch will not let me fucking edit the status.
[22:56.68]I don't know why.
[23:02.09]This is a different game.
[23:04.42]There we go.
[23:04.82]Okay, this is not the right game.
[23:16.70]Alright, let's go this way.
[23:17.75]Go back to the junction.
[23:30.79]Okay, go right.
[23:33.52]Go down the path.
[23:38.80]Okay, go down the junction.
[23:40.02]I didn't pay any fucking attention at all.
[23:41.80]Okay.
[24:09.79]Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[24:18.22]Is it Simon?
[24:19.86]Yeah.
[24:20.64]Detective Inspector Jenks.
[24:22.02]I'm investigating an incident in the village.
[24:23.87]Could I come in and ask you a few questions, please?
[24:25.91]Yeah, thank you.
[24:28.05]Yeah, you can.
[24:28.65]Come on in.
[24:35.87]We can just go through here if you want.
[24:37.51]Emma's working in the front room.
[24:39.16]Hi.
[24:39.30]Hi, hi.
[24:40.56]This is Inspector James.
[24:42.56]Jenks.
[24:43.46]What's all this about?
[24:44.76]There was a death in the village.
[24:46.22]Kate Vine, I believe you both knew her.
[24:48.20]Yeah.
[24:49.21]Do you need to speak to both of us?
[24:51.67]I'll just speak to Simon first, if that's okay.
[24:55.33]Just come through.
[24:57.93]I'll get it.
[24:58.37]I'll get it correct.
[24:59.78]Is it okay in here?
[25:01.50]Oh, this will be fine.
[25:02.64]I'll get it.
[25:03.10]Do you want anything?
[25:03.94]Water?
[25:04.60]No, no, no, I won't be long.
[25:08.44]Okay.
[25:18.41]Okay, let's, uh, her death.
[25:26.65]Did you know whether Kate had lost this or not?
[25:32.15]No.
[25:36.34]No, I don't think so.
[25:37.90]I've never seen it before.
[25:48.37]When was the last time you saw Kate Vine?
[25:53.97]Last Friday's meeting, I think.
[25:56.19]Did you see her after the meeting?
[25:58.43]No.
[25:59.59]How long have you known Kate?
[26:02.06]That would be when we started Atlas, three months ago.
[26:06.42]Did you socialize outside Atlas?
[26:09.24]No.
[26:09.76]I can't.
[26:10.26]How would you describe her?
[26:12.30]What sort of person was she?
[26:14.92]Well, she's talented.
[26:17.86]She was full of life, you know?
[26:21.30]Sharp, quite sharp.
[26:22.88]Would you say she had any emotional problems?
[26:27.56]She, her mood, her mood could change.
[26:30.89]And, well, there was the drinking problem.
[26:33.27]When did you become aware of that?
[26:34.99]Well, she would come drunk to meetings sometimes.
[26:39.26]And she would reek of the stuff.
[26:40.94]I mean, everyone knew, but nobody really said anything.
[26:44.24]So, tell me a bit about Atlas.
[26:47.22]Oh, it's just a business management training program for post-grads.
[26:52.59]And you started this after you left college?
[26:55.01]Yeah.
[26:55.85]And it's on every Friday?
[26:58.07]Yeah, well, my group isn't doing it this Friday, but one of the groups is.
[27:02.36]Okay, thanks.
[27:13.56]Jeremy has officially embarrassed himself.
[27:15.36]I don't... Do you think I care right now?
[27:19.50]What the fuck do I care right now?
[27:22.61]Honest to God.
[27:23.63]I'm like... I'm so dead.
[27:24.93]I'm about to go... You know what I'm about to do?
[27:28.71]In a minute here.
[27:30.55]You'll see.
[27:31.09]Oh, fuck.
[27:31.49]This is really close.
[27:37.55]If it'll work.
[27:39.10]And I'm gonna do it, because I don't, whatever, okay, let's get this, let's get this transform, let's get it in the right spot.
[27:53.69]In nine minutes, we're gonna do something else.
[27:59.11]When was the last time you saw Kate Vine?
[28:04.00]So last Friday's meeting, I think.
[28:06.94]Did you see her after the meeting?
[28:09.16]No.
[28:09.22]How long have you known Kate?
[28:12.80]That would be when we started Atlas.
[28:16.11]Three months ago.
[28:17.17]Did you socialize outside Atlas?
[28:18.73]It's the same thing.
[28:19.97]No.
[28:20.05]How would you describe her?
[28:23.05]What sort of person was she?
[28:25.67]Well, she's talented.
[28:28.62]She was full of life, you know?
[28:32.06]Sharp, quite sharp.
[28:33.64]Would you say she had any emotional problems?
[28:37.36]Exit, exit, exit, exit.
[28:38.40]Get me out of here.
[28:40.84]Okay, cool.
[28:41.52]Thank you.
[28:41.94]I'll probably be back later.
[28:43.16]Don't worry, it's only a few questions.
[28:46.84]Yeah.
[28:47.88]This is too big.
[28:52.51]When was the last time you saw Kate Vine?
[28:55.91]It was last Thursday in the college library.
[28:59.09]Um, I saw her and we chatted for a bit.
[29:03.74]She seemed her usual self.
[29:05.46]What was her usual self?
[29:07.90]Oh...
[29:09.63]Kate being Kate.
[29:10.81]You know, a bit wild.
[29:12.03]Wild?
[29:12.65]It's so hard.
[29:13.49]What way wild?
[29:15.69]Oh, she just used to question everything, you know.
[29:18.11]Have arguments with the lecturers, things like that.
[29:20.55]What else?
[29:22.79]Kate had a drink problem.
[29:24.71]How noticeable was that?
[29:28.16]Well, it wasn't at first, but as the year went on, she'd be drunk in the afternoon.
[29:34.64]But I think she cut down, you know, towards the end of college and when she started her PhD.
[29:47.83]Imagine being this bored is what somebody said.
[29:50.07]That's fucking hilarious.
[29:53.51]It's so weird when it lines up well.
[29:56.97]What am I doing?
[29:58.91]What am I doing here?
[30:00.23]That's all for the moment.
[30:01.09]Thank you.
[30:04.72]Where did my fucking facecam go?
[30:08.14]Try to match up the eyes?
[30:09.24]I'll try that.
[30:09.78]Okay, good idea.
[30:12.50]My facecam is deleted.
[30:14.64]I don't know why.
[30:15.32]Hold on.
[30:15.64]I need to go get it again.
[30:19.12]Worst streamer.
[30:21.42]I'm sorry if this is what you get when you first come here.
[30:24.98]I'm fucking sorry.
[30:27.43]Typically we do other shit.
[30:28.83]We don't just do this dumb shit.
[30:32.21]Like, typically we do something else.
[30:34.49]But I had a lot of issues tonight.
[30:35.93]A lot.
[30:36.63]A lot.
[30:40.76]What the hell is going on?
[30:42.06]Where is it?
[30:48.83]What?
[30:51.95]Okay, my webcam broke.
[30:54.13]Oh my god.
[30:58.52]Did I really break my fucking webcam?
[31:00.86]Did that actually just happen?
[31:05.40]I think it did.
[31:06.05]That happened.
[31:06.61]The webcam's broken.
[31:11.60]Well, it's alright.
[31:12.04]We only got like fucking four more minutes until we play Team Fortress 2.
[31:16.07]That's what's gonna happen.
[31:17.79]I'm gonna play TF2.
[31:19.51]Because this is just like fuck it Friday.
[31:21.57]You know what I mean?
[31:22.57]This is who gives a fuck Friday.
[31:29.08]Yeah.
[31:30.26]Yeah.
[31:30.96]This is who gives a fuck Friday.
[31:40.38]Am I gonna play?
[31:41.36]Why not?
[31:45.39]It's not worth it.
[31:46.33]I mean, I was, like, curious.
[31:48.47]Like, they did, like, some changes, right?
[31:53.13]Stop playing this game.
[31:54.31]Everything got thrown out of, into hell when Red Dead Redemption didn't work.
[32:00.19]And that whole story I told at the beginning of the stream, go watch the fucking opening ten minutes of the stream and you'll see what the fuck happened.
[32:07.74]It was a nightmare.
[32:13.40]No, not Titanfall 2, Team Fortress 2.
[32:18.18]There hasn't been a single update since I last played.
[32:20.60]Oh, whatever.
[32:23.42]This stream is the best.
[32:28.20]I hope so.
[32:28.42]I hope you've at least liked it for a second.
[32:42.76]But, um, I tried.
[32:46.14]That's all I can say.
[32:47.43]I tried.
[32:50.63]I tried.
[32:52.43]Okay, that's it for now.
[32:53.93]Thank you.
[32:57.85]Best to knock on the window for Emma.
[32:59.51]Simon always answers the front door.
[33:01.05]No, no, we're getting out of here.
[33:02.64]I'm out.
[33:03.82]We're gonna go into TF2.
[33:05.02]I'm gonna play as the fucking, like, Heavy and just murder people.
[33:10.63]No, I don't want to knock on the window.
[33:11.85]A few more questions, if you don't mind.
[33:13.31]Oh my god, fuck off.
[33:16.21]TF2 is, like, ready to go.
[33:20.28]Make fucking- I don't want to make this a regular thing, are you serious?
[33:26.00]Look, like, it was either VR or Red Dead Redemption.
[33:30.61]And, like, I could have had... VR takes a while to set up.
[33:33.43]It takes, like, a long time to get it, like, ready to go to stream it.
[33:37.17]I didn't do that.
[33:37.83]I was like, I'll play Red Dead.
[33:38.91]And, like, there's, like, a thousand options I have to, like, play.
[33:43.07]All of them need, like, time to set up.
[33:44.97]And, like, I tried to set up Red Dead and you saw what fucking happened.
[33:48.49]It was a nightmare.
[33:53.77]Play this game in VR?
[33:56.51]We're turning on the fucking webcam.
[33:59.81]And we're going to play TF2.
[34:02.62]I could play Mountain Blade.
[34:03.64]That is true.
[34:04.16]I could.
[34:09.30]But I really do think I broke my webcam.
[34:11.33]It doesn't work.
[34:15.97]My webcam isn't even turning on.
[34:19.57]Oh, shit.
[34:23.57]The PS4 is still turned on.
[34:26.63]God.
[34:26.95]Alright, well, whatever.
[34:31.11]Let's play TF2.
[34:33.06]Just for fun.
[34:35.76]I think my computer's blue-screening, by the way.
[34:38.10]I'm blue-screening.
[34:39.70]I'm blue-screening.
[34:41.32]Oh my god, don't fucking do it.
[34:43.52]No!
[34:49.31]Can you guys hear me?
[34:52.11]I don't know if you can still hear me.
[34:53.29]I believe this is the third blue screen of the night.
[35:01.99]Yeah, I'm stuck.
[35:04.12]I'm stuck in a black screen, by the way.
[35:07.02]This is fucking outrageous.
[35:11.54]Yeah, my OBS is crashing.
[35:14.99]Honestly, everything that could go wrong did go wrong.
[35:19.49]without a shadow of a difference.
[35:20.95]Like, everything went wrong.
[35:27.48]Yeah, this is my brand new fucking $4,000 computer, by the way.
[35:30.82]This was four fucking grand, this computer.
[35:34.72]And this is, like, potentially the third blue screen in a row.
[35:41.69]Oh, my God.
[35:44.21]This is such a fucking disaster.
[35:53.90]This is six core fucking 1080.
[35:57.36]This thing is fucking, I spent my entire life on this computer.
[36:03.47]And OBS has crashed.
[36:06.77]It's just sitting here hanging.
[36:08.63]Can you guys see anything on the screen?
[36:11.17]Probably not.
[36:12.45]What a joke.
[36:19.54]I'm so fucking angry right now.
[36:24.12]Chalk it up to another stream of, like, just everything that could go fucking wrong went wrong.
[36:29.20]Everything.
[36:31.26]TF2 is, like, launching right now.
[36:34.80]And I can't even... I can't do anything with it.
[36:45.81]Why is OBS, like, broken?
[36:47.67]I'm like... I'm...
[36:54.06]Well, this is what happens.
[36:55.08]This is a live broadcast, guys.
[36:57.32]Sometimes it just don't fucking work.
[36:59.00]No matter how hard you try.
[37:02.89]And I've been trying real fucking hard tonight.
[37:12.33]I'm gonna try this.
[37:12.97]I'll be right back.
[37:13.91]No, we're not fucking done.
[37:15.21]We're not done.
[37:15.91]Fuck this.
[37:16.41]We're not done.
[37:16.87]I'll be right back.
[37:19.25]I'll be back in two seconds.
[37:21.49]This is bullshit.
[37:26.97]I'll be right back.
