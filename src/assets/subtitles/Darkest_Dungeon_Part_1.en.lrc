[01:01.21]Jesse, you're concerned about me and my family.
[01:05.67]You shouldn't be concerned about me.
[01:07.51]I am the one who knocks Jesse.
[01:11.77]Hey, how are you?
[01:17.76]Who remembers that one?
[01:18.40]Remember that?
[01:20.32]Good quotable fucking TV show.
[01:25.70]Good evening, guys.
[01:26.36]Hi.
[01:28.12]We did this joke already.
[01:29.42]I've done that, I've done that, like... 15 fucking times.
[01:35.26]I've done that a lot of times.
[01:37.75]How many times have you opened up a stream... Where, like, you've been here at the very beginning?
[01:41.43]Like, some of you very beginning-ers, right?
[01:43.39]Like, some of you very beginning, like, people.
[01:47.41]Like, how long have you guys been here... Where I start a stream and I do, like, the Joker?
[01:55.69]That's happened, like, at least 12 times.
[02:02.15]How many times have I done, like, Jesse?
[02:03.61]Like, when I start a stream.
[02:04.45]It's just like, I'm just a fucking idiot.
[02:06.41]Like, sometimes I just say words.
[02:09.17]I don't know why.
[02:12.69]That joke is funny.
[02:13.52]It's better every time.
[02:15.18]What's my weakness?
[02:17.10]Why would I tell you my weakness?
[02:19.74]You're gonna have to figure it out.
[02:20.64]You're gonna have to figure out where to shoot the big black spear into my chest.
[02:25.72]I'm not gonna tell you.
[02:28.57]What was the dragon's name from Lord of the Rings?
[02:31.61]The Hobbit?
[02:32.37]There and back again.
[02:34.81]Smaug, right?
[02:35.97]I'm not even going to try.
[02:41.11]Hey, let's play Darkest Dungeon.
[02:44.99]Garfield?
[02:45.49]No.
[02:53.21]I was going to go for it, but no.
[02:54.61]No, we're not even going to go for it.
[02:57.33]Actually, you know what my real weakness?
[02:59.79]Sleep.
[03:00.05]I'm not even kidding.
[03:05.15]I may as well be like fucking Jojen Reed.
[03:08.40]My strength and my weakness is sleep.
[03:11.40]If I go to sleep, see you later.
[03:12.94]You ain't going to get a hold of me.
[03:14.06]I ain't going to get up for anything.
[03:16.01]My house could be burning down to the ground.
[03:18.63]And if I was dead asleep, like really sleepy, I would just be like, I'd look left and I'd look right, I'd be really tired and I'd be like, I must have been inevitable.
[03:27.60]And I'd put my head down and go back to bed.
[03:30.46]It is a weakness.
[03:35.58]Anywho.
[03:39.66]I bet Jerm is playing this on bed on his shitty iPad.
[03:42.03]Here's a funny story for you before we go.
[03:45.73]Darkest Dungeon.
[03:46.59]Look, Jeremy, why are you playing Darkest Dungeon?
[03:48.07]This game came out like a year ago.
[03:49.13]Why are you playing it now?
[03:49.89]Well, first of all, the DLC came out like a couple months ago.
[03:53.05]So, okay, Crimson Court came out like pretty recently.
[03:56.07]But, I wanted to wait until this game came on iPad.
[04:00.77]So I could play it in bed.
[04:02.17]I saw how cool it looked like a year ago.
[04:03.97]I was like, oh shit, Darkest Dungeon looks like a really fun game.
[04:06.13]I'd be probably really into that.
[04:07.25]Ah, I can't play it lying down in bed.
[04:09.69]Okay.
[04:10.49]Okay.
[04:11.76]And guess what?
[04:12.38]It came out on iPad like a week ago.
[04:14.30]So I like downloaded it on iPad, got my feet in the water, and realized I really enjoy it.
[04:20.55]So I'm ready to transition.
[04:23.83]We're gonna transition to the PC version.
[04:26.77]I already know a little bit.
[04:30.19]I'm not one of those streamers that knows everything about this game.
[04:32.99]You're probably going to have a lot of shit to say about it.
[04:34.81]First of all, I know about the merchant class.
[04:37.52]The Antique Equator.
[04:39.38]I know if you bring them, you get more money.
[04:41.84]And they should be touching all the curios.
[04:43.40]I know that.
[04:43.84]I understand that.
[04:44.88]The Antique Equator.
[04:45.90]When they come on the right mission, I know that.
[04:47.98]You probably didn't think I knew that.
[04:51.35]Anyways.
[04:52.61]Let's get started.
[04:58.03]Semi-pro.
[05:02.01]But this is... I beat a boss.
[05:05.02]I've already beaten one boss on the iPad version.
[05:07.64]And I'm like, you know what?
[05:08.50]I'm liking this.
[05:09.16]I think I want to stream this.
[05:11.74]So I've like completed some stuff already.
[05:14.20]And look, I was going to do that to make sure.
[05:16.32]Because this is one of those games where if you go in blind on stream, other games that I've done this with in the past, and I just fumble around and I'm a fucking idiot.
[05:24.96]Well, we're not going to be an idiot.
[05:26.37]Well, we might be.
[05:27.67]But I'm not going to be a clueless idiot on this stream.
[05:32.95]I can fucking bet your bottom dollar on that one.
[05:34.89]Let's go.
[05:37.07]I probably will get wrecked.
[05:37.85]I don't know.
[05:44.45]Let's begin.
[05:46.51]You may enable multiple DLCs at once for any estate.
[05:49.65]Okay.
[05:50.19]Well, this is just the Crimson Court, right?
[05:53.31]So why would I turn this off?
[05:54.33]This is the new class.
[05:55.95]I don't know.
[05:56.73]All I know is this guy is like a frontline person.
[05:58.35]That's all I know.
[06:00.01]And I did look up what this was.
[06:01.58]You get like little buildings that give you buffs and stuff.
[06:05.30]Something like that.
[06:09.80]Crimson Court sucks.
[06:11.91]Well, I mean, whatever.
[06:13.69]We're going to keep it enabled.
[06:14.73]We're not playing on Blood Moon.
[06:17.98]We're playing on the Darkest campaign.
[06:22.72]Oh, did somebody say Clueless Idiot?
[06:24.92]Yeah, we did.
[06:27.87]Hold on.
[06:28.35]We're just going to do the normal difficulty.
[06:31.01]Just Darkest.
[06:31.65]We're not going on Radiant.
[06:34.09]We're doing Darkest.
[06:36.70]DLC installed and the estate... I couldn't even fucking... I couldn't even... I was trying to... Alright.
[06:42.21]Here's a cutscene.
[06:44.81]We have the default... The default name of the fucking estate.
[06:47.99]Really?
[06:52.71]You will arrive along the old road.
[06:57.10]It winds with a troubling serpent-like suggestion through the corrupted countryside.
[07:03.81]Leading only, I fear, to ever more tenebrous places.
[07:09.59]There is a sickness in the ancient pitted cobbles of the old road.
[07:14.48]And on its writhing path, you will face viciousness, violence, and perhaps other damnably transcendent powers.
[07:23.80]So steal yourself, and remember there can be no bravery.
[07:34.75]without madness.
[07:37.33]The old road will take you to hell.
[07:40.77]But in that gaping abyss, we will find our redemption.
[07:47.89]The narrator's really good.
[07:49.89]I looked him up.
[07:51.19]Whoa.
[07:53.05]Hold on.
[07:56.51]KXZ501 gave a hundred fucking dollars.
[07:59.71]A hundred dollars for the intro to Darkest Dungeon.
[08:06.07]$100 for the intro there.
[08:08.58]That's a $100 intro.
[08:10.40]That intro cost the developers $100 to make.
[08:12.68]No, it was probably like $4,000, but it doesn't matter.
[08:17.30]Anyway, thank you, KXE, for the fucking $100.
[08:22.04]$100 right into the pit.
[08:24.84]It was a good intro, what can I say?
[08:28.14]Yeah, it was a good intro.
[08:31.61]Anyways, yes.
[08:32.75]Extremely kind of you to give me $100.
[08:34.79]We haven't even been live for fucking two minutes.
[08:39.77]Much love.
[08:40.27]Thank you so much.
[08:41.81]That's... That's too much money.
[08:43.69]I'm gonna have to spend... Look, I'm gonna spend that money.
[08:46.74]Look, I already know this shit.
[08:48.00]You don't think I know this already?
[08:50.02]You don't think I know what to do in this game?
[08:51.72]I've got like a solid 48 minutes in this game.
[08:54.90]You don't think I know everything about it?
[08:56.62]Come on!
[08:59.94]I know how to do this.
[09:02.90]You don't have to tell me this.
[09:06.63]We can skip this part.
[09:09.99]Oh, we got ambushed.
[09:11.23]What do I do?
[09:11.81]Solid 48 minutes.
[09:13.59]How do I fight?
[09:16.03]I know how to fight.
[09:20.08]Don't really think I'm stupid.
[09:22.74]Although, you're probably going to put this guy in the back.
[09:25.58]No, this is a fucking tutorial.
[09:26.66]Who cares?
[09:27.06]It's a bleed.
[09:29.95]He's gonna die right now.
[09:30.55]I've got a debuff on him.
[09:31.57]Smite him.
[09:32.33]One, two, three.
[09:33.59]Done.
[09:34.99]Loot?
[09:35.61]Oh, shit.
[09:36.23]Each item, if you... I know how to fucking take loot.
[09:40.98]Switch it off.
[09:41.40]Get back to normal.
[09:42.18]Yeah, I know you do that.
[09:43.62]The torch, if you have more light, you get surprise left off it.
[09:47.32]And if you have less light, you get extra loot.
[09:49.36]You guys didn't think I knew all that, did you?
[09:51.40]Got a solid 48 minutes in this game.
[09:55.28]I want you to take that.
[10:00.01]Ah, we got a big guy now.
[10:10.12]Why am I getting surprised every time?
[10:12.30]Get this text out of the way.
[10:16.72]Bad streamer can't beat the tutorial.
[10:18.68]Yeah, he can.
[10:20.02]Although it's a little weird for me because I'm used to playing this on the iPad.
[10:22.81]Can you imagine hearing that and the person's not joking?
[10:28.49]Let's...
[10:31.16]Let's get the guy.
[10:31.92]Let's, let's, let's, let's mark this dude in the back.
[10:35.64]I need to, like, move him forward.
[10:37.06]I got kind of screwed.
[10:38.04]How do you get screwed in the tutorial?
[10:40.17]I don't know.
[10:43.93]How do you get, like, screwed in the, I don't know how you get screwed in the tutorial.
[10:46.79]I'm not sure.
[10:50.00]Stun that guy.
[10:50.58]I don't want him to do anything.
[10:51.86]I need to move backwards.
[10:54.46]Mobile gamer.
[10:55.50]Let's fix this so I can just get this over with.
[10:59.19]I'm gonna stunlock him if I can.
[11:01.03]And he fucking resisted it.
[11:01.87]I'm gonna lose in the tutorial.
[11:03.75]Oh, wow.
[11:04.25]He just did 31 damage.
[11:06.59]We're reading right to left.
[11:07.88]It's a manga.
[11:08.82]Holy shit, that actually did hurt.
[11:12.92]Am I gonna die from RNG in the fucking tutorial?
[11:15.40]That'd be so funny.
[11:18.70]Okay, now... The guy in the back.
[11:22.07]I don't wanna... I just fucking killed this guy.
[11:31.47]Reign of whips.
[11:32.49]Fine.
[11:34.88]He just dies in the tutorial.
[11:37.30]There's no way that's gonna happen.
[11:39.58]I, like, that's not gonna... I crit that guy for 31 damage.
[11:44.78]Why are people saying reset?
[11:45.98]Oh, fuck, his name might... That doesn't matter.
[11:48.78]That's fine.
[11:51.96]Why?
[11:52.26]Come on.
[11:52.64]Why do you resist?
[11:53.26]You resisted it twice in a row?
[11:57.92]That's kind of poor shit, if you ask me.
[12:01.23]And the one thing that's weird about this game that I find to be... Like, this game's all about RNG, right?
[12:07.37]It's like, literally, roll the dice, the video game.
[12:10.14]Which, that's fine.
[12:12.68]How... I thought this was a turn-based RPG.
[12:15.14]It's not.
[12:16.13]There are no turns in Darkest Dungeon.
[12:17.89]That's something that took me a while to figure that out and, like, understand.
[12:21.39]Everybody just has a speed.
[12:23.98]Everyone's got a speed, a number on their person that is a speed number.
[12:28.44]It just rolls this every time, right?
[12:30.64]Like, 1 to 8, and then it adds this on top of it.
[12:33.44]And whoever literally, in every single possible... Like, after I go with this guy, everybody rolls, right?
[12:42.70]And whoever just has the highest number gets to go.
[12:44.54]There's no turn.
[12:45.98]That took me a long time to fucking understand that.
[12:49.86]Quest completed.
[12:50.42]Yep.
[12:50.50]Yep.
[12:50.98]Yep.
[12:51.18]I want to open this chest.
[12:53.46]It's a tutorial chest, and it's got something good.
[12:56.12]There are turns?
[12:58.98]I thought it was everybody has a speed denomination, and it just rolls every time.
[13:06.64]Too complicated.
[13:07.42]Alright, well, let's go.
[13:09.88]That's it, right?
[13:15.35]Blame... I ignore game mechanics.
[13:21.55]Speed tells you the order of the turn.
[13:25.47]Turns dictated by speed.
[13:28.35]Yeah.
[13:29.69]But my point is it's not like... You know like in typical RPGs, like a turn-based RPG, where it's like, okay, party one, you go, you go, you go.
[13:39.13]Party two, you go, you go, you go.
[13:41.44]Back to party one.
[13:43.02]I mean, some RPGs have the little speed bar, like Chrono Trigger-esque, but still everybody gets their own turn.
[13:54.14]yeah you go turn up the music alright now here's another thing if you don't know about Darkest Dungeon is every time you can get them in the dungeons too but if you level up or if you do a mission you get you get that you get the fucking happy sad face theater thing and it gives you quirks and sometimes it can be bad sometimes it can be good
[14:18.29]Experiences religious visions and delusions.
[14:20.53]And you know, has this forever until I remove it or until it gets replaced.
[14:26.89]I don't really know what these mean.
[14:28.07]I think he just kind of like... I think randomly this guy will just be like... And it'll like stress everybody out, right?
[14:36.07]It's okay.
[14:36.49]Whatever.
[14:37.27]Deadly plus 1% crit.
[14:38.39]Cool.
[14:39.51]And these are my first two troops.
[14:41.07]That's cool.
[14:45.06]You go.
[14:47.74]Okay.
[14:48.20]Let's listen to this.
[14:51.30]That's the whole game.
[14:55.63]So, uh, Darkest Dungeon.
[15:03.71]The reason why I like this game.
[15:05.41]Why, you know, the 48 minutes I put onto, like, the iPad.
[15:08.41]It's way more than that, by the way.
[15:10.77]I like that there's just a shitload of bad guys that I have to get rid of.
[15:14.61]There's just a ton of bosses.
[15:16.85]So there are just a bunch of bosses that are hard.
[15:19.51]So if you like Dark Souls, it's very much like Dark Souls.
[15:22.55]It's a Dark Souls type game because there's bosses in it that are hard.
[15:26.01]And when your heroes die, they're permanently dead.
[15:28.77]So if you like Dark Souls, it's just like Dark Souls.
[15:34.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:37.15]I actually need to read these because I need to know what they are on the keyboard.
[15:45.00]That's just helping that.
[15:45.94]Whatever.
[15:46.26]Let me see.
[15:47.42]Right click on it here.
[15:48.22]Okay.
[15:49.12]This is... I gotta have to learn... I gotta relearn some controls.
[15:52.46]Just because I'm used to using my finger.
[15:54.30]Okay.
[15:56.06]That's... You just right click.
[15:56.84]Okay.
[15:58.32]So another reason why I like this game.
[15:59.82]Why I've been sort of wanting to play it a lot.
[16:03.82]Is every single one of these buildings all has a purpose.
[16:07.54]And it can all be upgraded a bunch of times.
[16:10.11]These heirlooms down here...
[16:12.68]You collect these in the dungeons, and that's how you upgrade the... I'm like, why am I talking like you guys have never played this game?
[16:19.01]If you've... Maybe I haven't, I don't know.
[16:22.99]Someone just asked if this is Minecraft.
[16:30.19]I'm going to play this as if none of you have ever played it.
[16:39.48]I've got to be careful when I do this, though, because I only have a certain amount of time in the game.
[16:45.12]A game like Darkest Dungeon, it is just like Dark Souls, right?
[16:48.37]In the sense that there are a bunch of people that know way more than me.
[16:52.71]And if I explain something incorrectly, then those people are going to be like, whoa, dude, that's fucking completely wrong.
[16:58.03]And I'm giving misinformation to the people that have no idea what they're watching.
[17:01.74]So I'm in a weird position here.
[17:03.16]You know what I mean?
[17:03.66]Like, just like Dark Souls.
[17:05.26]Like, if I tell you a secret how to beat, like, for instance, the Curator in Dark Souls 2.
[17:10.40]If I tell you how to, like, beat the Curator, then it might not be the correct way for you.
[17:17.16]But somebody that has beaten the Curator a thousand times already knows, like, the one spot to hit him in the leg.
[17:21.20]You know what I mean?
[17:32.70]Alright, let's keep going.
[17:35.22]It's just like Dark Souls.
[17:37.37]Who?
[17:39.33]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[17:41.49]So, you go and... Let's start at the Stone Age, okay?
[17:46.94]This game's about just doing dungeons.
[17:48.97]It is called Darkest Dungeon.
[17:50.75]You embark on a quest.
[17:53.03]Each one of these has a certain amount of level that you have to be.
[17:56.99]So, for instance, we only have one here.
[17:58.54]Green means you have to be, like, 0 to 2 level.
[18:03.68]You level these guys up.
[18:04.62]The highest level, I believe, is 6, right?
[18:06.20]Because that's the Darkest Dungeon, right?
[18:11.05]So you can get to a max level of six.
[18:12.91]That could be wrong.
[18:13.75]Again, like Dark Souls 2, just like the Curator, I might be saying wrong information.
[18:18.51]But you have to level people up to be able to do the Darkest Dungeon, which is like the hardest one.
[18:26.80]I didn't recruit.
[18:27.30]I know, I know.
[18:28.10]I'm just showing the map for all people that have no idea what's going on.
[18:30.26]You bring four people.
[18:33.02]Each person, they're all classes.
[18:34.79]They all have their own different things they do.
[18:36.35]Plague Doctor is like a ranged diseaser, like doing dots.
[18:41.52]The Vestal is a healer, support.
[18:44.64]So they're essentially giving you... What about him?
[18:48.02]This is fake?
[18:49.10]What are you talking about?
[18:52.04]Name one of them after me?
[18:53.04]Yep, you got it.
[18:54.66]What's his name?
[18:55.62]Buff.
[18:56.25]Buff Shamans.
[18:56.93]He gets a name!
[18:58.83]This guy, right here.
[19:04.67]Thought I was fucking kidding?
[19:05.95]Did you, like, think I was kidding?
[19:08.65]You think I'm, like, kidding?
[19:09.67]Okay.
[19:11.67]You thought that was a joke?
[19:14.77]No, nobody else gets a name.
[19:24.88]What the fuck did I do?
[19:28.22]I'm gonna make sure this guy dies, like, immediately.
[19:35.16]No, fuck.
[19:35.68]I already, like, screwed it up.
[19:37.32]No, I'm not gonna be using... Maybe I will be using these guys.
[19:40.53]Name one after myself.
[19:41.43]Well, I'm definitely going to be the bird guy.
[19:44.87]Yeah.
[19:45.51]If I was going to pick somebody to be, it would be bird Jerma.
[19:52.80]This is not, like, actually me.
[19:53.98]It's bird me.
[19:54.72]You know what I mean?
[19:56.76]And I want to be blue.
[19:57.42]Do they have any blue?
[20:00.84]Of course they don't.
[20:03.04]I don't want this character, though.
[20:07.25]Okay.
[20:07.69]Here we go.
[20:08.05]I'm going to be red.
[20:10.75]Name one after me.
[20:11.57]Alright, how about... Name one... Whoa, what a waste.
[20:19.31]What?
[20:23.49]Get the expansion.
[20:25.92]Alright, what about this guy?
[20:27.30]He's a highwayman.
[20:28.06]He's a rogue.
[20:29.24]He's got the one-handed dagger.
[20:30.28]He's got the pistal.
[20:31.14]So, I'm going to say... Okay.
[20:38.70]And this is our...
[20:41.68]Let's rename her.
[20:46.56]Let's see.
[20:47.40]She's got a book.
[20:48.46]She's knowledgeable.
[20:49.24]She can heal.
[20:49.86]It's got to be somebody like me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[21:00.07]I'm not just going to pick random people in the chat, guys.
[21:02.39]That's not how this works.
[21:05.65]If you think it's going to be a random person in chat,
[21:17.69]They're all going too fast.
[21:23.14]It's just gonna be a random fucking person.
[21:27.02]Alright.
[21:27.56]Here we go.
[21:29.26]You.
[21:30.88]It's going too fast.
[21:32.04]I can't even pick somebody from chat.
[21:34.64]I'm just trying to... I'm just copying and pasting.
[21:37.95]Copy.
[21:39.07]I copy and pasted like nine people in chat.
[21:41.21]And it's gonna be one of you.
[21:42.65]Got him.
[21:56.09]There we go.
[21:56.77]Got egg salad 78.
[21:57.87]You are now in the game.
[22:01.15]Egg salad 78.
[22:01.99]Congratulations.
[22:04.44]Okay, so... Why have we spent so much time doing this?
[22:07.34]Okay, let's go.
[22:12.04]So the stage... Everything can be upgraded.
[22:16.79]So remember I told you about down here?
[22:21.53]Mod this person.
[22:23.35]No.
[22:24.27]No, I'm not going to mod egg salad 78.
[22:26.31]The lottery winner.
[22:31.99]Alright, so the stagecoach, I'm trying to explain the game.
[22:35.19]There's a lot to explain.
[22:36.51]I'm not the type of person to be able to do this unless I'm on a commentary, alone, with the blinds shut.
[22:44.49]Anyways, so this gets loaded up with random people.
[22:48.49]There are a ton of different classes.
[22:50.88]I can increase the amount of people I can have in my party.
[22:54.54]Like, not in my party, but in my house.
[22:56.74]In my land.
[22:57.66]My city.
[22:58.08]What can I call this?
[22:58.58]A town.
[22:59.28]It's a fucking town.
[23:00.78]You can increase the amount of people you can have in your town.
[23:04.28]You can increase the level that they start at, but you have to upgrade your blacksmith and stuff first.
[23:09.20]Or I can increase the number of available heroes.
[23:12.40]So, when I come back here each week, there'll be four people.
[23:15.42]If I click this, there might be fucking seven.
[23:20.05]I mean, free.
[23:24.36]I told you.
[23:25.34]Just like Dark Souls.
[23:26.72]I'm trying to like, I'm the guy.
[23:30.52]You understand.
[23:31.06]Okay, here we go.
[23:32.64]Let's just do a mission.
[23:33.42]I'm going to show you my real fucking video gamer skills.
[23:35.74]Just listen to this.
[23:46.36]That's alright.
[23:47.24]In time, you're going to know what happens.
[23:49.11]Anyways, Foxy Fury, thanks for the $30.
[23:52.07]Upgrade the stagecoach, you dingus.
[23:53.61]I know.
[23:54.39]I will.
[23:54.75]I will.
[23:55.07]Don't worry.
[23:55.75]I'm going to.
[23:56.15]I'm sorry.
[23:57.12]It's overwhelming.
[23:59.40]Thank you for the $30, though, Foxy Fury.
[24:01.00]Appreciate it.
[24:01.84]I do have to upgrade the stagecoach because that's important to get immediately.
[24:06.04]I think.
[24:07.49]Increases the size of the... We'll do them both.
[24:09.55]Available heroes.
[24:11.07]Bang.
[24:11.47]Bingo.
[24:11.91]Now when we come back, there'll be more people that will be here.
[24:15.59]Now, hero barracks.
[24:16.61]I can increase the size of how many people I can have.
[24:19.56]Bang.
[24:19.88]Bingo.
[24:20.24]Got it to 12.
[24:20.50]Now, these are all locked.
[24:21.08]I can't do these yet.
[24:29.88]Go get the blood court.
[24:33.32]Where people die.
[24:40.84]Where is the DLC content?
[24:44.68]Where is that?
[24:47.80]Do I need to do a certain thing to do it?
[24:50.12]Because I don't see it.
[24:50.78]It's a new building, right?
[24:55.96]Oh, it comes up later.
[24:56.56]Okay.
[24:57.65]Alright, let me explain.
[24:59.37]Oh, there it is locked, okay.
[25:02.66]There's nothing else I can really do right now.
[25:04.96]So we're gonna embark.
[25:07.95]Let's put some of these people in here.
[25:09.25]Let's take a look the usual suspects.
[25:10.93]Yeah So if you take you right click on anybody's name here, you can see where what moves they have You can only take four moves into a dungeon.
[25:20.38]So eventually you can take you can have this person Let's say for instance exiled 78 can have all these moves, but you can only have four active in a dungeon So you have to pick and choose like do you want this to be a buffer?
[25:32.19]Do you want this to be a healer?
[25:33.39]Do you want this to be a stunner?
[25:36.36]You ain't gonna have to call Stone Cold for that one.
[25:37.96]You know what I'm saying?
[25:39.34]So, that's fine.
[25:40.64]And this is where they're preferred to be.
[25:42.38]Depending on what you have selected, this is where they're most comfortable.
[25:45.74]So, this is fine right here.
[25:47.54]This is where they're all the most comfortable.
[25:51.56]And we're gonna go.
[25:52.72]We're gonna go to the provision state.
[25:57.80]Battle Cleric.
[25:58.42]I usually use the Vestal as... Actually, you know what?
[26:03.42]These two can share.
[26:04.24]It's fine.
[26:04.80]It don't matter.
[26:07.71]Minus fucking two.
[26:08.67]Why?
[26:09.93]Come on.
[26:11.03]I need another cup of coffee.
[26:13.69]I don't even have any more coffee.
[26:15.09]Fuck.
[26:17.92]What did I get myself into?
[26:19.44]Okay.
[26:19.72]The game sounds... It's very interesting.
[26:22.48]It's a very fun game.
[26:34.74]No, no.
[26:35.09]It's gonna be good.
[26:35.65]Don't worry.
[26:36.61]So, when you go on an adventure with your four chosen adversaries or allies, you're gonna get the option to pick a bunch of items to take with you.
[26:45.89]This is your inventory.
[26:47.99]You cannot hold any more than this.
[26:50.01]This is your... If you fill this up with loot and stuff, you're gonna have to start throwing shit in the trash.
[26:54.88]Okay?
[26:56.21]reason why it's called Darkest Dungeon is because game gets a little dark you know what I mean you get a one two three four five six seven eight let me I'll take like eight torches that might be a little too much for the first mission but it's alright this increases the level of the light in the dungeon so so uh there is you'll see we'll explain it when we get there
[27:23.27]We need to take food.
[27:24.39]Adventurers have to eat as well.
[27:25.99]Alright, you know what this reminds me of?
[27:31.64]So, like, okay, if you're a math teacher, alright, and I've actually had this problem before.
[27:35.62]I'm not even kidding.
[27:36.30]This is a real story.
[27:37.00]We're gonna take a second and now I'm gonna tell this fucking true real story.
[27:41.11]So, if you're a teacher...
[27:43.43]and you know everything about like long division, for instance, right?
[27:47.22]You teach long division, you teach multiplication tables and like basic algebra.
[27:54.84]You know how to tell that to people.
[27:56.22]You know how to teach that to somebody, right?
[27:59.08]I, right now, am the substitute teacher.
[28:03.02]I only know what was given to me.
[28:05.74]I don't really know... I mean, I know how to do long division.
[28:07.92]But here's the story.
[28:08.62]So I used to be a substitute teacher at a middle school.
[28:11.58]And in class one day, I was giving... It used to be I hand out a fucking couple of worksheets.
[28:17.73]right the kids would all come in and I would put on like a fake accent because I was a weirdo I'd do like a fake british accent for no reason and they'd all come and sit down and be like uh good afternoon everybody uh my name is uh Mr. Elbertson it's uh absolutely wonderful smashing to see you all uh please uh take this worksheet and complete it at your leisure and then we're gonna have a study period for the rest of the evening
[28:39.77]It was funny, and I fucking made myself laugh, and I entertained myself, right?
[28:43.65]So one day, I couldn't fucking dick around.
[28:46.79]I could just sit there and play with my hands.
[28:49.87]I would just play with my hands, you know what I mean?
[28:51.33]Just looking at him and stuff.
[28:52.91]But one day, it got to a point where I couldn't do that.
[28:54.99]The teacher wanted me to actually teach long division to the students, because they were in the middle of it, and they had a test the next week, and the teacher... I needed to continue her lesson.
[29:08.12]I don't know how to teach long division to somebody.
[29:10.76]I don't even know how to do it.
[29:13.67]I'm getting flashbacks of me being like, fuck, hold on, I gotta teach this now?
[29:18.05]And I can't just look at my hands?
[29:20.12]So I'm sitting there at the blackboard doing a long division problem.
[29:24.50]And, like, panicking, because I'm just like, hold on, 12?
[29:26.74]You have to carry shit, too, right?
[29:28.56]And I'm just sitting there, like, everyone's staring at me.
[29:30.95]And I'm just like, hold on, I can't so fucking avoid it.
[29:32.43]How do I do this?
[29:33.29]How do I do long?
[29:33.81]I haven't done long division in, like, 16 years.
[29:36.33]And, like, everyone's staring at me.
[29:39.78]It was terrifying.
[29:40.38]And that's what's happening right now.
[29:45.68]I have to teach you guys long division, and I don't know, like, how to teach it.
[29:51.09]So right now I'm just like, oh, you take these shovels just in case.
[29:53.39]What do you do that for?
[29:54.51]Oh, yeah.
[29:55.33]Because there's stuff you have to break.
[29:57.23]The teacher left me with a lesson plan.
[29:59.01]I'm sorry.
[30:02.22]Just show them a movie.
[30:03.02]That's what I used to do.
[30:07.12]You should have been honest with them.
[30:09.52]But that's the thing.
[30:10.28]I'm supposed to be like the teacher.
[30:12.90]I got fired fucking two days later.
[30:19.06]Alright, so anyways, adventurers have to eat.
[30:21.00]I didn't get fired.
[30:21.64]It was a fucking... I made that whole story up, alright?
[30:24.55]I didn't get fired.
[30:25.53]I'd never get fired.
[30:26.81]I don't get fired.
[30:29.61]Let's go.
[30:29.97]Let's go on the darkest fucking dungeon.
[30:32.07]And then we're gonna bring a key, too, just in case there's a chest open.
[30:39.36]What?
[30:39.66]Like?
[30:40.28]Yeah, I made that whole story was a fucking lie.
[30:47.63]It was a true story.
[30:49.06]No, it was.
[30:50.38]There was some truth in that one.
[30:51.42]It was.
[30:55.16]I was a substitute teacher, yes.
[30:56.18]That's true.
[30:57.10]And that did happen.
[31:00.29]I had to teach math, and I didn't know how to teach it.
[31:03.91]I knew how to do it, but didn't know how to explain it.
[31:07.07]Anyways, so we got our four.
[31:08.95]We got the Wizard of Oz here.
[31:10.37]By the way, that's going to be a party.
[31:11.67]It's adventure.
[31:12.01]We're going to make the Wizard of Oz.
[31:13.91]So we're going to move on.
[31:15.61]Down here is our map.
[31:16.47]We traverse through this way.
[31:17.73]Here's the four squares, depending on what's there.
[31:20.03]Here's the light, right?
[31:22.41]So when this is at full burn, see the plus to dodge, the plus to scouting, and you surprise monsters more easily.
[31:29.59]That just means that they don't get to go first and they kind of shake around and stuff.
[31:33.54]The darker it gets in the dungeon...
[31:36.28]And let's talk about this.
[31:37.18]So, stress.
[31:37.88]So, you see that, like, on that guy's head?
[31:41.27]Stress damage, you get stressed out when you go in a dungeon, right?
[31:44.79]Obviously, if you guys were put in this dark dungeon, I'd be shitting my pants.
[31:48.75]So, this is the shit your pants beater.
[31:50.01]When it fills up all the way, and lots of things can cause stress.
[31:52.81]See, like, that guy just, like, thought about something scary, and he got stressed out.
[31:56.77]When this fills up all the way, it's a different than health.
[31:59.19]It's a completely different bar than health.
[32:00.94]This guy shits his pants when it gets all the way to the top.
[32:03.55]They shit their pants, and they get like a very, very potential negative effect on their character.
[32:10.37]There we go.
[32:11.29]If it fills up twice, they have a heart attack, and it could just kill them.
[32:17.20]We're doing long division right now, guys.
[32:21.52]This is a room with a chest in it, so obviously we're gonna... This is gonna be fairly easy, so...
[32:28.64]I don't know why I tried to bleed this guy.
[32:30.98]Why did I even do bleed?
[32:32.69]I'm just fucking teaching long division.
[32:36.55]So again, this guy, this here, me, bird Jerma.
[32:40.93]Plague doctor has grenades and dots and they can stab, you know, for long division.
[32:46.25]So we're going to get the guy in the front with this.
[32:48.79]And he'll eventually die from this and maybe we can, you know, there.
[32:56.56]I didn't think it was gonna be this difficult for me to explain this fucking game.
[33:01.54]Yeah, and when somebody dies, they leave a corpse, and it fucks up everything, because you can't, like, the corpse has to be removed, or you have to, like, go over the corpse.
[33:11.88]This is just annoying.
[33:12.62]It's not gonna do anything, any problems, though.
[33:14.28]Fucking long division.
[33:16.01]I miss it.
[33:18.77]Tries to bleed a skeleton.
[33:20.23]Well, you know what?
[33:20.89]Look.
[33:22.88]It's alright.
[33:23.50]It doesn't have to.
[33:25.46]We're fine.
[33:26.32]I gotta get rid of this.
[33:27.10]I gotta get these subtitles off the fucking screen.
[33:29.62]And we got a chest here.
[33:30.92]I can use this key and we might get a secret compartment.
[33:33.60]I'm gonna show you how this works.
[33:35.68]I can open this with my bare hands and it might hurt me.
[33:38.07]If I use a key, bingo.
[33:56.24]What the fuck is this?
[33:57.76]I don't know this lesson plan.
[34:00.88]God damn it.
[34:03.76]The blood is a special type of supply item.
[34:05.86]Any collected bottles of the blood will be retained in your estate at quest end.
[34:10.49]They may be added to the provisions of embarking parties.
[34:12.71]The blood is rare.
[34:14.25]Spread it around wisely among those in need.
[34:18.05]What the fuck does this do?
[34:19.87]This is a DLC thing, isn't it?
[34:22.64]There's blood in the box.
[34:23.46]There is.
[34:25.37]Only the blood will quell this thirst.
[34:27.23]It has to be some kind of werewolf thing.
[34:29.33]Who knows?
[34:31.13]So scouting, if you want to know.
[34:33.73]Scouting is you get a chance when you complete a room.
[34:37.87]And you get bonuses depending on how much light there is.
[34:41.42]Depending on who's in your party.
[34:42.48]Depending on if you have any trinkets that increase it.
[34:44.76]You can see what's ahead of you.
[34:46.70]So ahead of me right now there's an obstacle.
[34:50.54]Which I don't have... I didn't take a shovel.
[34:52.67]Yeah, I did.
[34:53.29]Yeah, I did!
[34:55.21]So there's an obstacle that I need to break with a shovel, and there's a fight.
[34:57.85]And you can plan which way you want to go based around what's in front of you.
[35:03.61]And let's go ahead and take a torch, because I want full blast.
[35:06.45]I don't want to fuck around right now.
[35:07.95]This is the tutorial mission.
[35:12.19]So I use that shovel.
[35:13.15]Alright, let me go in here.
[35:14.73]I need to get rid of those subtitles.
[35:19.79]Where the hell are they?
[35:23.19]Where are they?
[35:24.89]Control options.
[35:26.99]Graphics.
[35:29.98]Gameplay.
[35:31.06]Did I miss it?
[35:34.40]Other.
[35:35.14]Tutorials.
[35:37.74]Where is it?
[35:38.10]Oh, there we go.
[35:42.67]Top.
[35:43.35]Bottom.
[35:44.33]Off.
[35:44.47]I'm going to turn them off.
[35:47.41]You guys already know what's going on.
[35:48.39]You want the music?
[35:50.61]Music's now at 20 percentile.
[35:56.70]Yeah, we don't need subtitles.
[35:57.71]You guys can hear.
[35:58.51]Alright, let's keep going.
[36:04.57]Alright, so I could have got... See, they got surprised because there was enough light.
[36:08.87]I didn't get surprised.
[36:13.84]Alright, so let's... Let me think here.
[36:18.08]We're just going to go for it.
[36:19.52]I'm just going to try to shoot the guy in the back.
[36:24.85]I could get him to fall out, but who cares?
[36:27.63]Let's just try to kill this guy in the back.
[36:29.06]Dodge.
[36:29.46]Fuck you.
[36:29.90]That would have been a kill.
[36:33.66]I wish there was another person back here, because I could throw the grenade at two people.
[36:37.70]But... Just get it on this guy.
[36:43.24]Now I need to lower the music?
[36:45.83]What's wrong?
[36:46.13]What are you guys talking about?
[36:50.27]Music's still low?
[36:51.49]Oh, God.
[36:53.60]These would be like 40?
[36:54.23]Alright, I'll put it up to like 30.
[36:57.47]In a minute.
[37:03.26]I might be able to kill him with this.
[37:06.58]Oh, come on!
[37:09.44]What the fuck?
[37:11.49]Crank it at 100?
[37:12.01]No.
[37:15.15]There we go.
[37:19.16]I'm not doing a hundred.
[37:21.46]We're not gonna do a hundred, see?
[37:22.86]The position that he's in right now, I can only really do this.
[37:25.12]That's all I can do.
[37:26.32]And it killed him, so that's good.
[37:29.03]So these, if you're wondering, these are the heirlooms.
[37:32.47]And they take up a whole slot.
[37:33.85]They can stack up to six, I think these ones can.
[37:37.33]So it's all about just like keeping your light at a decent level.
[37:41.63]And going through the dungeon.
[37:44.19]I'm trying not to get fucked up.
[37:47.45]We'll turn the volume up.
[37:48.55]Hold on.
[37:49.75]It's just music.
[37:50.63]35.
[37:51.76]There.
[37:52.94]We'll do it how old I am.
[37:57.56]Okay.
[37:58.34]Let's go.
[38:00.26]Again, here we are so we can go up here move to this room This is a room battle so in this room is a fight, and it's a treasure in there Well this room has like an interactable object, so I'm gonna go what's like explore 90% of the rooms Let's try to avoid this one because there's a chest up here.
[38:15.76]I want to just get the chest Fuck the curio Stress stress and he's got a quirk that makes him open up stuff without me asking and he takes he's selfish oh
[38:30.49]Alright, so, um, okay, I didn't get any of that, by the way.
[38:33.97]If you're curious what the hell's going on, um, he's a kleptomaniac.
[38:38.74]So one of his problems that he has, everybody has a bunch of, like, issues.
[38:42.54]Remember, like, what was the name of that game?
[38:44.68]The game where you have, like, all the fucking weirdos that went into the dungeon?
[38:48.76]Legend something?
[38:49.66]Legend of Zelda?
[38:50.92]No.
[38:51.10]What's the, what's the, what, you had a bunch of problems.
[38:53.65]League of Dungeons?
[38:55.19]Legends of Dungeons?
[38:56.11]What was it called?
[38:58.94]I don't know.
[38:59.90]It was something like that.
[39:02.58]Rogue Legacy.
[39:03.65]Yeah, there you go.
[39:04.69]Imagine Rogue Legacy, but it's like a turn-based RPG.
[39:08.43]So they all have these issues.
[39:09.61]Kleptomania means he can just sometimes steal things.
[39:14.57]He's kind of the dick.
[39:16.39]It's alright.
[39:17.95]Castle Griffinstein.
[39:21.62]So here comes the fight.
[39:22.26]There's going to be a chest back here.
[39:23.46]Good thing I tried to make my I teach you long division and I blew it.
[39:29.34]Okay, this guy is dangerous.
[39:31.70]This guy is annoying because he does stress damage.
[39:34.40]And obviously, see where it is now.
[39:35.59]You don't want to get that high.
[39:36.79]But whatever.
[39:39.15]We're going to go with... I want to get rid of the guy in the back.
[39:48.43]And he resisted it.
[39:50.65]Am I a total moron here?
[39:52.80]I want to see his shit.
[39:56.98]No, okay.
[39:57.48]I just got unlucky.
[40:04.64]Let's stop this guy.
[40:06.49]How many fucking misses and dodges am I gonna get in the first two missions of this game?
[40:20.27]Okay, so his blight resistance is only 20%, so that was just bad luck.
[40:33.86]Um... Can I reach back there?
[40:35.88]No, I'm just gonna have to keep shooting.
[40:38.20]Come the fuck on!
[40:39.78]Give me a break!
[40:42.42]Do I have to fucking miss every time?
[40:46.27]Get it on him!
[40:47.91]Thank you.
[40:48.73]So that means that he now has the dot on him.
[40:55.01]That it's core damage every time he gets a turn.
[41:00.79]Let's go with some heals here.
[41:03.70]I don't want everyone to be dying.
[41:06.90]Stunned.
[41:07.26]He misses his turn.
[41:08.24]And this guy sucks.
[41:09.18]Now he has to move forward.
[41:10.14]Great.
[41:12.48]Uh, he'll... I could do it again.
[41:16.15]And it stacks.
[41:16.97]But he'll just die from it anyways.
[41:18.71]So we're gonna do it to... Let me do it this way.
[41:22.37]Let's see if we can cut him.
[41:25.17]Ah, he fucking resisted.
[41:26.41]See, he died.
[41:26.93]I knew what I was doing.
[41:30.32]Now he'll die from this.
[41:31.24]Okay, on his turn he's dead.
[41:33.43]So forget about that guy.
[41:34.49]Let's heal.
[41:35.59]Let's do some more heals.
[41:38.33]Three.
[41:38.97]Not good.
[41:43.83]Graveyard slash.
[41:44.71]Instant kill.
[41:45.81]Thank god I missed that.
[41:46.43]That was an instant fucking kill.
[41:48.05]I got so lucky.
[41:53.59]Got him.
[41:55.09]Alright.
[41:56.43]So.
[41:57.23]Ooh.
[41:58.69]Found a trinket.
[42:00.07]Trinkets are, you collect them, you can put them on certain characters.
[42:02.29]Some are... You know, some are only for specific classes.
[42:07.81]Some can be used by anybody.
[42:08.85]This is used by the Aeroblast.
[42:12.45]Whatever... The Arbalest.
[42:16.17]I say Aeroblast.
[42:17.41]Aeroblast.
[42:17.97]I don't know, because it's like... Aeroblast.
[42:20.79]It's a person that uses a crossbow.
[42:22.31]They shoot their fucking arrows through the air and it blasts people.
[42:25.85]It's the Aeroblast.
[42:27.52]I don't care what you say.
[42:28.96]It's the Eroblast.
[42:30.25]Eroblast.
[42:33.33]Unfortunately, this is a locked chest.
[42:36.55]And it would be great if I had the key right now.
[42:38.87]It's okay.
[42:39.17]We're good.
[42:41.07]We got some emeralds.
[42:42.18]A couple of crests.
[42:43.56]Nice.
[42:44.20]Let's get back into position.
[42:48.06]Okay, so we're gonna go right.
[42:50.60]I want to avoid this room.
[42:52.41]Because we just have to explore... We have to explore all the rooms but one.
[42:57.05]And that's the one I want to avoid.
[42:58.09]Because if there's no battle, I don't have to worry about anybody dying.
[43:00.33]And no stress.
[43:01.25]And I didn't even... Look, okay.
[43:07.64]So there's traps in the game.
[43:09.28]That can be on the ground.
[43:10.84]And you want to make sure you look out for them.
[43:12.06]Because they can be disarmed by certain people.
[43:14.34]And I was looking at chat.
[43:16.00]Because I was holding the mouse button down.
[43:17.30]Remember, overconfidence is a slow and extremely devastating killer.
[43:22.03]What's the meme from this entire game?
[43:25.36]I just had too much confidence.
[43:33.38]This is medicinal herbs.
[43:36.23]The portrait of some fucking Frankenstein guy.
[43:38.93]And more food.
[43:39.43]That's a lot of food.
[43:41.51]I did not need to take... I knew I shouldn't have taken this much food.
[43:44.33]What a fucking mistake.
[43:48.28]See, sometimes randomly in the dungeon... You will have to eat.
[43:53.46]You also eat when you camp.
[43:55.36]If you don't eat, if I don't have four food... And I can't use that...
[44:00.50]They will all get stressed the fuck out and do a bunch of damage to them.
[44:03.40]It's very awful if you don't have food.
[44:08.48]Let's keep moving.
[44:11.47]Nothing in here.
[44:12.23]Good.
[44:12.83]That's the way you want.
[44:13.83]That's what you want.
[44:14.41]Let's see what's in the last room.
[44:15.99]We got a scout here.
[44:18.60]Okay, so there is a room with treasure here, but there's also an obstacle that I can't get by because I don't have any more shovels.
[44:27.05]So this is gonna suck, but this is a treasure room.
[44:29.27]I'd rather do this one.
[44:30.35]Take the damage, deal with it.
[44:33.60]Yeah, you also can eat to heal, but it only heals a little bit.
[44:36.80]And like, for instance, watch.
[44:37.74]If I eat one of these pieces of bread...
[44:41.18]And it heals two.
[44:42.20]And you can do it four times or so before they're full.
[44:45.75]But it's really not recommended because you... When you do the longer missions, you have to eat food to heal in the longer missions.
[44:54.61]You camp out and it takes a lot of food.
[44:56.65]So you don't really want to do that, what I'm doing, kind of.
[44:59.96]And I don't have a shovel, so watch this.
[45:01.50]If you don't have a shovel and you have to go by an obstacle, watch.
[45:04.62]It's awful.
[45:07.90]That was like 20 stress damage to everybody.
[45:10.31]It's terrible.
[45:10.77]You don't want that to happen.
[45:12.67]Don't do what I just did.
[45:15.55]Alright, we're about 40 minutes in.
[45:18.18]This is as much as I know.
[45:19.96]I'm just kidding.
[45:23.10]This is the last fight.
[45:25.78]Watch out for the Circus Clown.
[45:26.89]The Circus Clown is the worst guy.
[45:29.51]He throws his blood vial at you and he fucking does a hula hoop thing with his waist.
[45:34.45]This guy also sucks too.
[45:36.78]So now I get to do what I like to do with the... I like the Plague Doctor a lot because...
[45:42.46]I like, here's the thing, I like to run two Plague Doctors.
[45:45.23]Bing bang.
[45:46.07]Because you can throw, you can fuck up the backline so bad with the Plague Grenade.
[45:50.69]And it stacks.
[45:51.33]So if you've got two Witch Doctors that throw two Plague Grenades, this is going to be eight damage a tick.
[45:56.17]You know what I mean?
[45:56.62]Like, bingo.
[45:57.86]As long as it hits.
[45:59.90]Which it did.
[46:00.36]Oh, I'm going to, you know, let's stun this guy in the front here.
[46:07.52]Blight doesn't stack.
[46:08.30]Yes, it does.
[46:10.28]Blight does stack.
[46:11.62]It absolutely does.
[46:13.96]So... Let's just go... Let's just shoot one of these guys.
[46:19.11]Because when they die... They'll die.
[46:21.93]This guy's dangerous.
[46:25.35]I want him to die right now.
[46:28.09]I can show these guys... You know, I can show these guys my bills.
[46:31.31]Like, my monthly bills.
[46:32.35]And they'll fucking freak out.
[46:33.33]Watch this.
[46:33.71]Like, whoa!
[46:34.19]Dude, you pay that much for internet?
[46:36.41]Plus fucking 50.
[46:41.14]But, yeah, Blight does stab.
[46:42.93]It does.
[46:44.21]That's why, like, if you run more than one class that has Blight, it's a good thing.
[46:48.85]Because you can throw Blight on the same guy.
[46:52.49]I could throw Blight on this guy right now.
[46:53.77]Then it'll stab me.
[46:59.53]This guy might die.
[47:00.33]Oh, shit.
[47:02.71]Oh, no, he's at death's door.
[47:04.57]Uh-oh.
[47:06.07]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[47:12.14]Have I just not been paying attention?
[47:13.20]This guy's like already gonna die.
[47:14.21]I gotta heal the- I gotta heal me.
[47:18.77]Alright, what's- how much is five?
[47:22.61]Four.
[47:22.81]Okay, I got- I got a- These guys are all gonna die.
[47:26.83]So this guy needs to take damage here.
[47:29.98]So, that guy has to take damage.
[47:32.28]Oh my fucking god.
[47:40.27]That would have killed all three of them, but now I have to stun this guy.
[47:42.78]There we go.
[47:48.38]Okay, please heal him.
[47:50.06]I was looking for a crit there, but it's fine.
[47:53.03]And now it's going to go bang, bang, bang.
[47:55.13]He's dead.
[47:55.87]The guy next to him is dead.
[47:56.89]He's dead.
[47:58.27]His daughter's dead.
[47:59.45]His uncle's dead.
[48:04.92]Alright, now they're dead.
[48:06.48]Just stab this guy in the face.
[48:09.34]And then the Blight will do the rest.
[48:13.96]Watch.
[48:14.14]I'm going to show this to you.
[48:15.32]Ready?
[48:16.02]So if this hits him, you'll see.
[48:17.47]This is going to do 8 damage.
[48:18.77]Okay, does it get it?
[48:19.31]Blight.
[48:20.53]Watch this.
[48:20.85]8 damage.
[48:21.15]That's a terrible crit.
[48:26.53]See?
[48:26.99]There you go.
[48:27.89]It stacks.
[48:29.10]That was 4 damage per tick.
[48:33.08]Bingo.
[48:37.56]Kind of want to just like... No, I'll just kill it.
[48:39.98]Fuck it.
[48:40.28]Alright.
[48:42.14]That is the first quest ever completed.
[48:46.90]Cool.
[48:47.16]Let's open this.
[48:52.52]Got a couple of heirlooms.
[48:53.74]Nice.
[48:54.14]Alright.
[48:54.66]Now, so we're done.
[48:56.28]This mission is over.
[49:00.25]We can leave.
[49:01.59]Quest complete.
[49:02.11]And it's going to convert all this to money.
[49:05.57]And we'll take a couple of things back home with us.
[49:07.89]Nobody died.
[49:08.99]Nobody went crazy.
[49:09.85]She got pretty close.
[49:12.22]Let's go.
[49:14.89]So I got $3,000 for these crests and a common trinket.
[49:19.37]It essentially throws all the shit you had in your inventory in the trash.
[49:23.54]Like, you can't take... This is why it's like food is so obnoxious to deal with and torches.
[49:28.38]Because if you don't take enough food, you're fucked.
[49:31.08]And if you take too much food, you lose so much because these were all what?
[49:36.26]What did I get for these?
[49:36.78]Like 10 bucks?
[49:37.42]5 bucks or something for each one of these?
[49:38.76]It's just a waste of money.
[49:40.24]I wasted so much money.
[49:41.58]Terrible fuck.
[49:42.20]Terrible play.
[49:44.42]And these are the heirlooms you need to upgrade the buildings.
[49:47.54]So let's see if anybody's okay.
[49:48.78]We got somebody to level 1, level 1, level 1, level 1.
[49:52.51]Cool.
[49:54.23]Nuke work.
[49:55.75]Weak grip.
[49:56.85]Minus 3% crit on melee skills.
[49:58.82]Okay.
[50:01.60]What did Bird Jerma get?
[50:02.85]Fear of the Eldritch.
[50:03.73]Okay, this is bad.
[50:05.71]I get more stress versus Eldritch, and I miss more versus Eldritch.
[50:11.13]Second win, plus 10% damage if I'm below 50% health.
[50:13.80]That's cool.
[50:15.44]EggSalad78, you're the man, man.
[50:16.96]You're the man!
[50:17.88]EggSalad78, you in the chat, you're the fucking best viewer.
[50:21.96]This person is obsessed with food.
[50:24.65]I don't really know what that means.
[50:25.47]Maybe that means they eat twice or something?
[50:33.47]How many egg salad 78s are there?
[50:38.99]Wait a minute.
[50:39.41]Wait a minute.
[50:39.81]Okay.
[50:40.13]I just looked over a chat.
[50:41.06]There were two egg salad 78s in this chat.
[50:44.96]How's that possible?
[50:45.60]What happened?
[50:47.70]There were two of them.
[50:48.28]There were two of you in the chat.
[50:50.02]Did you both make your fucking accounts at the exact same time?
[50:57.37]That's not even possible.
[51:00.81]Three?
[51:01.15]That's not possible.
[51:02.25]That's not even possible.
[51:04.87]Okay.
[51:06.84]So, we did our first quest.
[51:09.56]I love this game.
[51:11.72]I love this game.
[51:14.63]So, here's another thing to talk about.
[51:16.27]Uh, so, there are... Because this person is not really stressed out, I don't want to take this person on another mission.
[51:25.82]I can.
[51:27.18]I can take EggSalad78 on another mission right now.
[51:31.34]I can stick her in the back and be like, you're fucking coming with me, and you're gonna buff and you're gonna fucking smash and you're gonna fucking stun people.
[51:38.67]I could tell her, you could force people to go on missions.
[51:41.88]It's a terrible idea.
[51:43.30]If this lady comes on a mission, she's going to get her stress bar filled, and she's going to go crazy, and she just might die.
[51:49.64]She's going to be, like, useless, right?
[51:52.00]So... I've read some literature about how doing stuff like this is a potential waste of money.
[52:01.73]Because what you do is... So, for instance, the cloister, the... You know, there's, like, a bar.
[52:06.55]Well, this is the church, but, you know, there's a bar, too.
[52:10.37]So this is the church.
[52:11.01]Oh, you can pray.
[52:11.83]You can do meditation.
[52:13.01]You can get whipped.
[52:15.63]That... It's a thousand bucks to do it.
[52:19.11]But this will reduce her stress down to pretty much zero.
[52:23.70]But I've been told that over time, this stress will decay over time.
[52:29.14]But I don't know.
[52:30.94]I've been using it.
[52:32.06]I like it.
[52:32.38]It's fun to throw people into the meditation chamber.
[52:36.90]Egg salad only book.
[52:39.61]So what you do, if I put this person in here for $1,000, they stay in there until another mission is done.
[52:48.39]So when I click this, boink, this person can no longer come on a mission until I do another mission.
[52:56.10]So this person is done.
[52:58.42]So this guy could come along for another one.
[53:00.50]These, okay.
[53:01.34]These two, not so much.
[53:02.52]We're going to throw these guys.
[53:03.36]I don't know if we're going to do that.
[53:08.85]And the problem is certain classes, for instance.
[53:13.51]See, God-fearing, right?
[53:15.24]InTalent will only pray for stress relief.
[53:18.38]So he will only go... I can't put him anywhere else.
[53:20.64]He'll only go to the church.
[53:22.50]So you run into situations where you have...
[53:25.28]Okay, if I have like 15 fucking people here, and no, I only go to the church, then it can really fuck you over.
[53:31.80]And you have to like figure out what you're gonna do.
[53:33.00]You gotta plan who you're gonna put where.
[53:35.21]Because if they only want to go to one spot, and you have like five people that only want to go to one spot, then you're gonna be screwed.
[53:41.27]So, but we're okay right now.
[53:43.79]Let's just put him in the church.
[53:50.13]One of the egg salads used an I instead of an L. That's fucking stupid.
[53:57.05]I love it.
[53:57.37]Alright, let's go see who came into town.
[54:00.72]Let's go to the caravan.
[54:02.70]Okay, so... We've got an occultist, a jester, and a leper.
[54:08.36]All new people you haven't seen yet.
[54:15.35]I'm gonna take them all.
[54:16.23]Because I have to.
[54:18.53]So we're going to have... He's going to stick around.
[54:21.79]Actually, okay, this is a healer as well.
[54:23.45]So, okay, we did take them all.
[54:24.77]To fight the abyss, one must know it.
[54:28.58]So I like to do... You can sort by class, you can sort by stress level, you can sort by level.
[54:33.54]I like to sort it by stress or by activity so I know who's available.
[54:39.06]So he needs to be not available.
[54:41.22]Where can he go?
[54:41.70]Put him in here.
[54:45.25]Okay.
[54:45.37]Okay.
[54:48.28]So we're by activity.
[54:49.36]Okay.
[54:50.06]So here are the four people we have available.
[54:51.55]This guy's okay.
[54:52.23]He can go on another mission.
[54:54.35]Then we're going to do some names here.
[54:57.45]Leper is a front of the line tank.
[55:02.21]Alright, let's see.
[55:02.73]Okay, the last person that just... No, I'm not doing that.
[55:07.42]I was going to say the last person that gave bits, but no, we aren't doing that.
[55:10.16]It's not going to be like, oh, if you bid and give me a hundred bucks, I'm going to name you.
[55:13.80]That's not going to happen.
[55:15.78]Absolutely not.
[55:19.03]Let's go with spec tag.
[55:21.11]Spec tag is our leper.
[55:27.00]Okay.
[55:28.36]I'm in there.
[55:29.80]What about our magician?
[55:34.14]We're just doing random chat names.
[55:35.56]Like, is it really... Name one Etalyx.
[55:41.70]This kind of looks like Etalyx.
[55:42.94]Okay.
[55:46.71]Oh, fu- Alright, whatever.
[55:49.65]Conovilli Etalyx.
[55:52.84]This is like a funny guy.
[55:54.24]This is a funny guy.
[55:55.22]This is like a jokester.
[55:58.16]This is the real- Fucking comedian.
[56:03.26]Jokester.
[56:04.72]That's the real Jerma.
[56:06.30]That's me.
[56:09.52]We're good.
[56:14.24]That's me.
[56:15.50]Make sure this guy doesn't die.
[56:19.41]I have some things I can do, I think.
[56:22.12]I haven't unlocked any of this.
[56:23.50]The tavern can be upgraded.
[56:25.20]And essentially what this does is... See these boarded up windows here?
[56:28.66]You can eventually unlock all these.
[56:30.76]So more people can go into each one of these.
[56:32.76]And it's easier.
[56:34.02]You can make how much it improves people's stress.
[56:38.55]Stat recovery.
[56:40.59]Stress recovery.
[56:42.59]It's alright for now, though.
[56:43.29]I don't think I'm going to do this right now.
[56:47.88]Go to the brothel?
[56:49.46]Yeah.
[56:49.79]The brothel is a little too expensive, by the way.
[56:52.07]Fifteen hundred bucks?
[56:54.99]You tell me I lose more money going to see a potential prostitute than I do at, like, gambling?
[57:00.41]That's not real.
[57:02.47]You lose ten times more money gambling.
[57:04.05]Alright, um... Let's go.
[57:10.43]So, as you see here, now the ruins... It's opened up more missions to do.
[57:16.07]And some of them range from this one short...
[57:18.24]Just explore rooms like we did before.
[57:19.74]And here's your rewards.
[57:21.80]This one's also short.
[57:23.38]Complete all the room battles.
[57:26.34]This one's medium.
[57:27.80]Means it's a much bigger area.
[57:30.78]And I have to complete 100% of the room battles here.
[57:33.62]I don't like to do medium.
[57:35.83]Unless... Like, I mean, we could do a medium.
[57:39.35]But it scares me early game.
[57:41.09]It really does.
[57:41.51]Oh, let's see.
[57:45.43]We'll do a short one.
[57:48.04]This is for... I don't even have a flatulent yet.
[57:54.17]Mediums... Yeah, you don't want to do mediums this early, because everyone will die.
[58:00.23]Let's just do... We have an occultist, so... I don't have a flatulent yet, so... We'll just do this one.
[58:10.52]This one's easy enough.
[58:12.88]We'll take the Jester.
[58:13.97]And... These guys need to be in different places.
[58:19.45]The Jester kind of can be all over the place.
[58:21.53]But he's most comfortable in the third slot.
[58:23.37]Leper is in the front.
[58:24.91]He's a tank slash damage dealer.
[58:26.80]Occultist is usually...
[58:29.37]You know, I usually put the Occultist in the back.
[58:31.45]Just because I use him as a healer.
[58:32.77]This heal sucks.
[58:34.47]This heal is 0 to 13.
[58:36.73]And it has a chance to make the person bleed.
[58:38.83]It cuts them.
[58:40.43]I hate the Occultist.
[58:41.27]I hate using the Occultist.
[58:42.35]Because this shit says 0 to 13.
[58:45.61]Forget about that.
[58:46.76]It's actually 0 to 3.
[58:48.02]Because that's what you get every single fucking time you use this.
[58:52.40]It's just unlucky and terrible.
[58:54.28]But he is a healer.
[58:55.42]So, whatever.
[58:59.53]Late game Occultist is way better.
[59:02.47]Yeah.
[59:02.91]Early game though, this is always like a 1.
[59:05.25]And it hurts me.
[59:08.21]The la- Like, I've brought like some mid-level Occultists.
[59:11.80]And not even kidding, I don't think I've ever seen a number higher than 4.
[59:17.84]But, whatever.
[59:18.82]We got a good team here.
[59:20.24]Explore the rooms.
[59:21.74]Just go at it again.
[59:22.54]Darkest fucking dungeon.
[59:25.06]This time I'm not gonna go overboard.
[59:26.70]Let's do...
[59:30.11]Let's do eight food
[59:35.40]We'll do, like, five torches.
[59:37.94]That's okay.
[59:38.40]It's a short, it's short, it's alright.
[59:40.58]Even if you go, look, if you get down to zero light, it's not gonna, it's not the end of the world.
[59:45.61]It's bad, but if you go into total pitch blackness, total darkness, you actually, you get a ton of fucking negative effects, but you get a lot more loot.
[59:58.66]There's much more percentage chance you're gonna get, like, good shit.
[60:01.76]So, it's not all terrible.
[60:03.18]It's okay.
[60:04.91]Let's get a shovel.
[60:10.01]I know these, like, you can... There's a lot of weird things in this game.
[60:14.90]You know all those weird devices that I've been touching?
[60:17.64]The weird curios and stuff?
[60:18.88]You can bless them, right?
[60:20.52]Or something.
[60:21.02]So they're guaranteed to not be bad.
[60:22.92]Because it's pretty much like a coin flip.
[60:24.13]When you run into anything in this game, it's going to be bad.
[60:27.83]What's that?
[60:29.91]Holy water.
[60:30.57]Let's get one.
[60:31.65]Because I think I know I'm supposed to use this somewhere.
[60:36.13]No key.
[60:36.83]It's just 200 bucks.
[60:37.69]I don't want to do that.
[60:39.01]We're good with this.
[60:39.67]I'll be okay with this.
[60:45.11]It will remove a negative trait.
[60:46.33]Okay.
[60:48.79]Let's just go.
[60:51.59]Get two shovels.
[60:52.31]I know.
[60:53.51]The thing about short dungeons, though, is every time I... Here's the RNG dice roll gods.
[60:58.51]Every time I buy two shovels, there's no obstacles.
[61:01.80]Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[61:06.71]So, again, we have to explore 90% of rooms, which means we just have to... We have to go everywhere but, like, one room.
[61:13.71]So, how I typically will do this, you know, we're talking 48 minutes in the game, expert, is I will just not go over here, so I don't have to backtrack, and just go, like, bing, bang, bing, bang, bong, bing, bang.
[61:23.64]No, no, we're gonna go bing, bang.
[61:25.18]No, we're gonna go bing, bong.
[61:27.32]Bing, bong.
[61:29.72]Bing, bang.
[61:30.48]This place, this is awful.
[61:35.31]Let's go!
[61:35.69]Hey, look, a thing!
[61:38.15]Unburnt torch.
[61:40.45]Free torch.
[61:41.61]Always a good thing.
[61:42.19]And we got ambushed.
[61:44.87]This guy's gotta go.
[61:45.95]This guy's horrible.
[61:48.33]This guy just does stress damage and it's a shitload.
[61:51.49]And if I got the music, I know the music.
[61:53.32]I know.
[61:53.58]Hold on.
[61:57.14]There.
[61:57.74]40.
[61:58.62]There.
[61:59.28]Better?
[62:04.84]Better?
[62:05.76]Music?
[62:08.01]Okay, so... The Jester is interesting because he has the... I don't have the move unlocked yet, but he has something called Finale.
[62:15.77]He's like a buffer.
[62:16.45]He can reduce stress.
[62:18.01]I usually just like to use him for bleed.
[62:20.59]Because, you know, he can hit two people at the same time.
[62:24.27]So I like to use him for bleed.
[62:26.61]That guy resisted it, but it's okay.
[62:28.89]This guy is like a debuffer and a stunner.
[62:31.23]He can pull people.
[62:33.54]I, in fact, want to pull this guy forward.
[62:35.98]Because I want this guy to die immediately.
[62:40.12]He's already bleeding.
[62:41.06]Let's do it again.
[62:41.98]Let's slash him.
[62:46.28]Turn off the music.
[62:48.32]Oh, by the way, anytime you see, like, the light golden kind of white, like, ding, ding, that means that their stress is going down.
[62:55.18]Because they liked what they saw.
[62:57.91]Alright, uh, this guy, I love the leper.
[63:00.43]He's my favorite front of the class from the line.
[63:03.34]Because he can do Q. I just love hitting two people with the big sword.
[63:08.14]It just does so much damage and it's great.
[63:09.48]This is the best character in the game.
[63:11.54]Like, without a doubt.
[63:12.48]That is the best fucking character in Darkest Dungeon.
[63:14.83]Like, it just is.
[63:16.43]He has the most fucking health.
[63:17.89]He does, like, the most damage.
[63:19.99]Like, why would you ever not have a leper?
[63:22.33]I want three lepers and, like, a Vestal.
[63:29.55]Alright, let's... Nobody's bleeding.
[63:32.03]Let's just try to pick somebody off.
[63:34.75]Leopard is the worst?
[63:36.34]What?
[63:37.04]Leopard is so good.
[63:39.96]And you can clear corpses.
[63:42.28]You have this cool face mask on.
[63:44.14]Makes you look like a cool.
[63:45.10]Let's pull him in front of the corpse.
[63:53.96]Now, the thing with the Jester, I don't like using the Jester that much because they... It's like a class that moves around all over the place.
[64:01.06]See all the forward one, see forward three.
[64:04.35]You have to pair the Jester with classes that don't really mind where they're standing.
[64:09.15]But this guy, like the Leper, like has to be in the first two slots.
[64:12.87]And if you have like a Jester fucking up with the rankings, you can really... People can't do their moves.
[64:19.92]So, let's just... Let's just whack it.
[64:22.76]This'll kill him.
[64:24.10]He'll die from this.
[64:27.53]We got a leper.
[64:28.23]That's good.
[64:28.75]We're just gonna smash the guy in the front.
[64:30.63]Leper's the wor- Oh, leper sucks!
[64:32.17]Leper's the worst.
[64:33.71]Leper's the worst fucking thing in the game.
[64:35.79]Get outta here.
[64:40.37]There are four-man comps that work by everyone moving during combat.
[64:44.08]Yeah, that's really cool.
[64:45.28]That's a very interesting thing.
[64:48.24]I just... I don't know.
[64:49.04]That's a little... I'd rather just do, like, a pretty standard playstyle.
[64:53.86]Really?
[64:54.15]Two fucking ambushes in a row?
[64:59.93]He's gonna suck later on.
[65:01.11]That's alright.
[65:01.89]Now, these guys don't bleed, but this does more damage, I think.
[65:05.68]No, whatever.
[65:06.18]We'll just shoot him.
[65:08.60]Yeah, just shoot him.
[65:13.56]Well, you can't do much right here, so just debuff this guy.
[65:20.52]And again, leper sucks!
[65:23.08]Light's okay for now.
[65:25.72]Alright, so what is even in this room?
[65:35.77]I don't know.
[65:39.09]Leper sucks.
[65:42.59]You know what?
[65:42.97]I'm gonna go left and then back it up again.
[65:46.39]So I'm just gonna run right here.
[65:47.29]Might as well just do it.
[65:47.89]I have to backtrack.
[65:48.54]I hate backtracking because you get stressed out.
[65:50.84]What the fuck?
[65:51.72]Stop looking at the other side.
[65:55.22]Ugh!
[65:56.22]I need to stop looking away.
[65:58.14]That's what I get for fucking looking away again.
[66:02.26]Like, stop doing that.
[66:03.23]I can't wait for the leper to die.
[66:10.25]Leper's not gonna die.
[66:13.66]Absolutely not.
[66:14.26]Leper's not going to die.
[66:15.26]Okay, none of these guys can be bled.
[66:18.80]Should I just fucking launch?
[66:22.36]No, that's just not... Nobody can mark in here, right?
[66:28.27]Leper's not going to die.
[66:30.13]It's not going to happen, because watch.
[66:31.61]I'm going to heal him for zero.
[66:34.39]Okay.
[66:39.43]That shut me up real quick.
[66:41.29]Saying that he's like the worst healer.
[66:47.54]Uh, this... No, I don't have... I can't bleed anybody, though.
[66:55.49]Hmm... I don't have the finale, so... I mean, I don't want to go that far forward.
[67:03.99]And I don't want to... I'll go forward one.
[67:06.00]Just stab somebody.
[67:06.76]This is a bad comp.
[67:07.74]I don't even have the finale unlocked.
[67:11.54]So I have to do, like, three damage to these guys and not bleed... Whatever.
[67:15.54]I don't want to fuck this up.
[67:26.66]This is extremely, extremely useful.
[67:29.54]The only problem is it marks you.
[67:31.72]But if you have a big, bulky guy, like a boss or something, you can sincerely drop their effectiveness by 20% across the board.
[67:38.01]And that's just at rank 1.
[67:39.01]All these can be ranked up.
[67:42.11]Oh, what's that?
[67:42.77]Leper sucks.
[67:44.51]Meh.
[67:45.29]Meh.
[67:45.91]Alright.
[67:46.61]Let's go.
[67:46.99]Yeah, whatever.
[67:47.85]It's fine.
[67:50.11]Grapeseed shot.
[67:50.93]Nope.
[67:51.03]I'm just going to kill this guy.
[67:57.14]Heal.
[67:57.70]He resisted the bleed.
[67:58.46]That's good.
[67:59.02]At this point... No, let me... I'm just going to do it.
[68:07.71]Whatever.
[68:07.89]Let's heal the stress on him.
[68:10.77]I just don't want to move him because everyone's in a good spot right now.
[68:15.13]Is this a PC game?
[68:15.93]Yes, this is on PC.
[68:18.59]This actually was a PC exclusive for a while, right?
[68:25.56]So next, I can do Purge and get rid of all these, but I'm probably not gonna need to.
[68:34.07]So at this point, I can just dive forward and see where he ends up now he moves forward.
[68:39.97]It kinda fucked everything up, but it's fine.
[68:45.74]I wanna heal.
[68:50.50]Right in the tricep!
[68:58.51]Fucking leper sucks.
[68:59.51]I just cleared the corpses to make it easier to kill this guy.
[69:03.39]Let's heal.
[69:09.70]That was a perfect roll.
[69:13.88]Never seen higher than... Never seen higher than, like, threat... And look at that!
[69:18.86]Jester's the one that's the problem, guys.
[69:26.65]Plus 20% stun resistance.
[69:29.50]The issue, okay, so, like, I want, this is for you guys that are at the higher level.
[69:33.64]This is for you guys, the guys that know how to kill the Curator in three hits.
[69:37.41]Dark Souls 2, you know what I'm saying?
[69:38.85]That's a question I have for you guys.
[69:40.47]So, this is, how important is dodge?
[69:45.53]Because I know that dodge is just straight up like a percentage to not get hit, right?
[69:51.75]So everybody has an ACC rating, and everybody has a dodge rating.
[69:55.43]So if your ACC rating is 100, and I attack somebody with a dodge of 12, that means they have a straight up 12% chance to not get hit, right?
[70:05.89]So is it really... All these trinkets drop your dodge.
[70:10.67]All of them, it seems.
[70:14.04]It's not important at the end game, but really important early in mid.
[70:16.82]Okay.
[70:18.44]It's generally pretty important.
[70:20.68]Yeah, because I always feel like I'm scared to put on trinkets.
[70:23.48]Because... Oh yeah, let me put on like two trinkets.
[70:25.94]It's like minus... It's like five dodge.
[70:27.70]It's like... Really, it's like 5% chance to get hit.
[70:32.18]Well, just for the sake of having this on, so I can have... I don't need it right now.
[70:35.36]So this... An ornate fountain of holy... Should I use holy water in this, or is this just holy?
[70:41.71]Is this corrupted?
[70:45.19]The buffs usually outweigh the debuffs.
[70:47.41]So this doesn't need to be cleansed, right?
[70:54.31]This is just a stress heal, okay.
[70:57.66]Use the juice.
[70:59.90]Okay.
[71:00.86]Okay, it's just like a little heal.
[71:02.90]And I should have used it on this guy.
[71:05.28]Look, I'm still learning.
[71:07.66]As much as I know, I'm learning.
[71:09.33]Always learning.
[71:10.19]Always be learning.
[71:16.67]Just keep going.
[71:18.15]This is why I hate backtracking.
[71:19.24]Because everybody just goes... You can tell that holy water heals for a lot of health and heals 30 stress.
[71:27.42]Okay.
[71:29.28]Oh, that's cool.
[71:32.30]Watch out for that confidence.
[71:33.31]I know.
[71:37.55]I know a lot.
[71:37.99]Look, I know a lot about confidence.
[71:41.57]I know you've got to be careful with that shit.
[71:43.77]You get too confident and all of a sudden...
[71:47.10]You get too confident, all of a sudden you start putting, like, seven ads on a, like, 12 minute YouTube video.
[71:52.58]You know what I mean?
[71:53.06]That's what, when you get, like, that's, you gotta be careful there.
[71:55.95]Overconfidence there, you got, like, 14 ads on, like, a 20 minute video.
[71:59.07]You gotta be careful.
[72:00.15]Don't do that.
[72:04.05]Oh, these guys will not die from that.
[72:07.22]Now they will.
[72:07.70]Oh, come on.
[72:11.40]That's bullshit.
[72:12.40]It's alright.
[72:13.90]I'm gonna heal myself.
[72:20.81]Whoa.
[72:22.91]Whoa, dude.
[72:24.37]Oh, leper sucks.
[72:25.47]$1,000.
[72:26.29]That's a lot of money for early.
[72:31.34]That's good.
[72:33.32]Where are we going?
[72:34.74]Where's the scouting?
[72:40.63]Okay, I'm fine with that.
[72:41.67]No scouting.
[72:42.25]Come on.
[72:45.87]I have to backtrack.
[72:47.88]What if I go left?
[72:50.02]And then... Okay, so here's what we're going to do.
[72:52.05]We're going to go left, right, right, down, right.
[72:54.21]So I don't have to buckle around in a circle.
[73:00.47]Lepus sucks.
[73:01.25]Too easy.
[73:01.83]It's not too easy.
[73:04.48]He's just good with his broken sword.
[73:08.14]Dim, dark, bright, or day, our task is...
[73:15.03]How did I not see that?
[73:21.22]How am I missing these every fucking time?
[73:25.86]I always fucking seem to not put my eyes on the fucking screen when it's most important.
[73:32.85]Seriously.
[73:35.15]Not even overconfidence is an insidious killer.
[73:37.37]No.
[73:38.56]Absent-mindedness is a slow and insidious killer.
[73:46.10]Remind yourself that being an absent-minded fucking idiot will get you killed.
[73:55.46]They're invisible without scouting.
[73:57.82]Usually you can see them on the ground.
[74:03.80]I thought you could, like, don't they pop up on the ground?
[74:05.72]I've done no scouting before and they've shown up on the ground.
[74:09.69]Packs laden with loot are often low on supplies.
[74:15.36]I want this guy to just whisper an entire book into my ear.
[74:19.50]Is that weird?
[74:22.86]Is there a way that I want to lie on my back in my bed and just have this guy whisper the novelization of Star Wars just right into my ear?
[74:30.88]Is that weird?
[74:35.54]No more torches.
[74:39.64]Fuck.
[74:44.04]Don't get trapped.
[74:45.87]Okay, so this is what I'm talking about.
[74:47.07]See this food?
[74:48.35]That was eight food.
[74:53.92]Now we're getting dark here.
[74:54.68]I'm actually happy about this.
[74:58.10]So we have one more room to see, and then we complete the mission.
[75:06.41]Oh, fuck you.
[75:06.99]Come on.
[75:08.71]Let's just do this to him.
[75:12.23]For fun, why not?
[75:16.85]No finale.
[75:17.43]Like, there's no reason to have a Jester in your party without a finale.
[75:20.75]At least in my opinion.
[75:27.30]Stun him.
[75:31.54]And... Leopard sucks!
[75:37.58]He actually does have, like, a pretty high chance to miss.
[75:41.94]Well, you're useless right now.
[75:43.72]Whatever.
[75:54.63]Take the money and take the shotgun shells.
[75:56.63]Take the shotgun casing.
[75:58.45]Almost at the end of this one.
[76:05.46]Anybody else think this guy got surgery to sound like this?
[76:16.73]You know what I mean?
[76:17.17]I feel like this guy had surgery to sound like this.
[76:20.62]I'm gonna aim down sights.
[76:25.04]I'm gonna get the circus clown first.
[76:29.10]I could bleed the guy in the middle.
[76:33.00]No, I can't.
[76:33.64]I could bleed this guy.
[76:34.74]Let's just try to get this guy again.
[76:43.85]No, this is not even worth doing this.
[76:47.47]It's just going to put me forward.
[76:49.57]Only one of these guys is going to get blood from this, but I'm going to do it anyways.
[76:59.06]Hold that guy.
[77:02.42]Come on.
[77:04.94]Alright, here we go.
[77:06.23]Show me your worth.
[77:12.90]The pit beckons.
[77:13.76]So you see, like, this is the game, essentially.
[77:17.80]Because then that, it's dark.
[77:22.12]It's too loud.
[77:22.62]The music's too loud.
[77:25.80]We gotta turn this music down.
[77:28.60]It's too loud right now.
[77:35.02]Uh...
[77:39.83]No, it's not.
[77:40.69]Fix the audio.
[77:41.70]I know, that's what I'm saying.
[77:42.36]Everyone complained that the audio needed to be so loud.
[77:46.72]And look at how loud it is now.
[77:48.62]It's too loud.
[77:54.33]Ah, shit, he went crazy!
[77:57.93]He's selfish now.
[77:59.13]He got full stress damage, and now he's selfish.
[78:02.27]That means a few different things, right?
[78:04.94]That means...
[78:07.48]I think that means he'll just do whatever he wants on his turn.
[78:09.80]I can't control him anymore, right?
[78:11.16]Isn't that how that works?
[78:14.80]He shit his pants.
[78:18.06]So now if I make him do something, he might not do it.
[78:20.48]Let's see.
[78:23.16]Zero.
[78:23.48]Alright, good.
[78:27.63]He just does dumb shit now.
[78:28.81]Sometimes he'll pass his turn.
[78:30.68]I gotta get rid of this.
[78:31.28]This guy's gonna die.
[78:32.40]Die now.
[78:33.30]Come on.
[78:34.00]Fuck you.
[78:35.64]Die.
[78:36.82]There we go.
[78:37.32]Mission complete.
[78:41.92]And look at the loot here.
[78:42.58]We got extra loot.
[78:44.58]Oh, let's open this up.
[78:48.94]Let's hope for some... It's pitch black.
[78:50.68]Let's hope for some good loot here.
[78:53.36]50 bucks.
[78:55.02]Whatever.
[78:57.24]Jester is the best, better than the rest.
[79:01.72]Look at all this stuff we got.
[79:02.68]A lot of crests, so I'm happy with that.
[79:05.52]Now, we don't, like, if we want to, but no, I'm going to, I'm going to leave.
[79:10.17]Fuck that.
[79:12.21]This is the important part.
[79:13.97]You want to collect as many heirlooms as you possibly can.
[79:26.46]The narrator does audiobooks?
[79:28.66]Well, sign me up.
[79:31.82]Okay, we got a couple level 1s here.
[79:38.05]Leak of grip.
[79:39.49]That's not good.
[79:42.07]And... zoophobia.
[79:44.36]Stressed out versus beasts.
[79:45.96]Okay.
[79:47.14]That's fine.
[79:52.29]Severe negative quirks over time so never be able to lock into place and become severe New courtyard quest available Okay, so as a sanitarium unlocked yet I
[80:12.19]The blacksmith is now unlocked.
[80:14.07]And the guild is now unlocked.
[80:16.63]So, the blacksmith, as you see when you put somebody in the blacksmith.
[80:20.95]Okay.
[80:25.71]Okay.
[80:27.49]I didn't want to talk over him because his voice is like fucking... His voice is like smooth margarine on toast.
[80:33.79]So I don't want to talk over it.
[80:36.19]So as you upgrade the blacksmith and as your heroes get to higher levels, you can upgrade this shit.
[80:42.66]So they can go upgrade it up to level four, right?
[80:46.96]Costs a lot.
[80:48.98]You can also upgrade all their moves and buy new ones.
[80:52.63]So this is why I like this game.
[80:54.65]This is why I think this game's fun.
[80:56.59]There's something about getting to the next level on your guy that's really, really fun.
[81:03.59]Controversial opinion.
[81:07.65]So I'm gonna do this because I feel it's pretty important.
[81:14.10]Because it's armor and weapons and cost reduction.
[81:16.79]So I want my people to be stronger, you know?
[81:21.51]Eggshell story.
[81:22.37]What do you mean, eggshell story?
[81:27.95]There's no eggshell story.
[81:31.79]Have you ever beat this game?
[81:33.09]No.
[81:35.03]I've played, like, a handful of time in this game.
[81:39.46]I've beaten a boss, I've leveled up some stuff, but no, I've never completed the game.
[81:44.10]I'm just currently, I currently think it's fun, so that's why I'm playing.
[81:47.62]Make up a story about eggshells.
[81:49.68]Um, Donald, don't feed them to your dogs.
[81:52.71]Don't, don't, like, give your dog eggshells.
[81:54.59]Don't eat eggshells.
[81:55.29]You don't eat an eggshell.
[81:56.61]There you go.
[81:58.77]Uh, let's do this.
[81:59.27]So, bingo.
[82:00.37]Now we can upgrade people's weapons.
[82:06.35]So it's obviously pretty important because the more damage you do, obviously, the less you have to be in fights.
[82:12.01]I don't have enough to do armor smithing.
[82:15.96]But this is where I like money managing and resource management.
[82:22.20]I just made a dog fart joke.
[82:23.40]What are you talking about?
[82:23.98]No, I didn't.
[82:25.54]But it's expensive.
[82:26.20]This is very expensive to do this.
[82:27.34]So you want to do this like... You can't tell a moral without a story.
[82:32.67]What?
[82:34.35]That's a PSA, not a story.
[82:38.49]Yeah, a personal story anecdote.
[82:40.37]That's what a PSA is.
[82:42.31]You don't know that?
[82:44.75]Let's upgrade this.
[82:47.61]Let's get the A team here.
[82:51.53]I know for a fact that I'm going to have this guy for a little while.
[82:53.45]I know for a fact that I'm going to have him for a little while.
[82:57.97]Because you don't want to upgrade everybody.
[82:59.79]That's the thing.
[83:00.46]Because most of these people are going to die.
[83:03.44]These guys are going to fucking die.
[83:04.90]Almost all of them.
[83:09.37]So, you don't want to dump a bunch of money into people like, for instance, BirdJerma.
[83:14.87]BirdJerma ain't gonna last very long.
[83:16.79]BirdJerma's gonna die next round.
[83:18.88]I'm gonna probably say that.
[83:20.04]He's probably dead next round.
[83:22.74]But Spektak.
[83:24.90]Spektak's gonna be around for a while.
[83:29.24]Spoiler alert.
[83:30.16]Spoiler alert, everybody you see here is probably going to die.
[83:34.48]Permanently.
[83:38.04]Okay, let me look at the... I don't... Okay, how much is it to level this up once?
[83:43.91]6 and 14.
[83:44.85]So now, point!
[83:47.33]I can upgrade their skills.
[83:49.31]Okay, let's, uh... I know for a fact that Time Machine 9 is going to be around for a while.
[83:54.96]Where is... Duelist Advance...
[84:00.52]Okay, so this is, you go forward one, minus 40% damage when Riposte activates Riposte.
[84:06.94]So I, I, this is good.
[84:08.67]I want this.
[84:11.19]Yeah, you heroes can only have four skills.
[84:16.21]So I can't have, I can't bring all these to the dungeon.
[84:20.53]So let's, the pistol shot obviously is going to be upgraded because it's just good.
[84:27.04]Okay, here's the thing about point-blank shot.
[84:29.48]Point-blank shot is cool, but I feel like my highwaymen are never in the front slot for more than one round.
[84:37.75]And I know that it makes you go backwards, but that means you have to make them go forward.
[84:41.07]So I have to do this more than once, and then do this and go backwards.
[84:45.93]I'd put him with a jester then.
[84:49.05]You know what I mean?
[84:52.29]I would have to move him to the jester team, because that would mean he could be dancing around.
[84:57.17]Point blank is for bosses.
[84:59.69]Advance point blank.
[85:00.47]Yeah.
[85:00.75]No, I know.
[85:05.21]Let's do... Let's do that.
[85:08.67]I don't give a shit about these right now.
[85:11.23]The jester.
[85:12.27]Where is finale?
[85:13.43]That's like we have to have this move.
[85:14.81]That's like the only reason why you have a jester.
[85:18.15]And... The ballads are good.
[85:22.13]These are actually very, very interesting.
[85:24.73]They buff your finale damage.
[85:27.08]I like to just be like a... I like to use the Jester as a kill shotter.
[85:30.70]You know what I mean?
[85:33.24]So I like to just use him as a buffer, and then now I'm going to instantly kill somebody.
[85:41.65]So let's go ahead and do this.
[85:45.55]Let's be Mr. Songman.
[85:50.75]So we're going to get rid of all his moves except for all of his songs and his finale.
[85:56.67]Didn't finale get nerfed?
[85:57.58]I don't know.
[85:58.68]I'm not sure.
[86:01.60]So we got this one.
[86:02.56]You get this forward three.
[86:05.40]And this one is back three.
[86:09.49]Although I do kind of... Which one of these do I not want?
[86:16.70]The stress heal is so important.
[86:18.12]Like, it's just too good.
[86:19.50]You have to have it.
[86:20.71]It is... Unfortunately, this is one of the only moves in the fucking whole game that is, like, a reliable stress heal.
[86:28.13]Right?
[86:31.43]This is just good to buff the team.
[86:34.60]It's just you get extra speed, more chance to hit, and crit.
[86:38.04]This...
[86:40.00]It's just a debuff to 10% chance to hit on the other team.
[86:43.24]But finale, 50%.
[86:44.38]What do you guys think?
[86:46.10]Solo or Battle Ballad?
[86:49.65]What do you think I should take first?
[86:51.43]Because we're doing one, two... We're doing one... Yeah.
[86:56.21]I have to take this.
[86:59.89]I know another way to heal stress and combat.
[87:01.13]The dog, right?
[87:02.79]Some people have their own heals, right?
[87:06.21]Battle Ballad?
[87:06.71]Okay.
[87:07.45]That's what we're going to do then.
[87:09.15]We're going to go one, two, three, four.
[87:14.21]This is good.
[87:15.05]Okay.
[87:19.90]Should I get point blank shot?
[87:21.22]I don't know.
[87:22.36]Not... Look at all these decisions.
[87:26.22]Obviously, we're going to level up the leper.
[87:30.04]And I'm going to do pretty much... What's the...
[87:34.17]Self-heal is good.
[87:35.41]This is I love using this even though it's like this kind of sucks Clearing corpses is important, but I don't know if it's as important as something else Mark You get minus nine stress.
[87:48.07]This is just a self heal and then this is a self buff But you debuff yourself, too
[87:56.85]Just recruit before you upgrade.
[87:58.77]Well, the thing about recruiting is I'm gonna get level zeros until I... Right, where is it?
[88:04.55]So, I'm gonna have level zeros until I get this up.
[88:09.20]And then there's a chance that there'll be level ones and level twos, right?
[88:16.72]Uh, let's just keep going here.
[88:19.38]Where was I?
[88:22.70]Um...
[88:25.98]25% damage and a crit and you just lose protection and dodge, but that's like a big, big smash.
[88:36.23]I kind of want that.
[88:36.91]I want it.
[88:37.81]I want it.
[88:38.75]Yeah, I want it.
[88:40.73]I'm getting it.
[88:41.21]I want it.
[88:43.19]I just want it.
[88:43.61]You want me to get an air blast?
[88:49.22]Actually, I'm going to bring her back in because I want to upgrade her heal.
[88:52.14]That's all she's going to get.
[88:54.90]Bird Jerma?
[88:55.40]I don't really care about bird Jerma.
[88:56.56]You know what I mean?
[88:57.60]So, like, who cares that bird Jerma exists?
[89:00.96]I don't really want to play doctor right now.
[89:05.10]Okay, um, let me bring in the aeroblast.
[89:10.16]Now we have four and four.
[89:13.40]Can't be upgraded.
[89:14.72]Nothing can happen here, but let's take a look at our trinkets.
[89:19.31]Uh, 10% move skill chance.
[89:23.15]How do I sell this?
[89:25.12]I know how to sell it on iPad.
[89:26.16]How do you sell it on PC?
[89:28.42]Hold shift.
[89:31.06]Who cares?
[89:31.68]That's dumb.
[89:34.60]30% move resistance.
[89:37.26]The move resist thing.
[89:41.75]I don't give a shit.
[89:43.27]Some people might tell me that that's a big mistake, but I don't care.
[89:46.71]This one, on the other hand.
[89:47.65]26 stun resistance.
[89:52.17]I feel like...
[89:56.62]Give me the name.
[89:57.34]Is the game on iPad?
[89:58.04]The game is on iPad.
[89:59.70]It just came to iPad last week.
[90:01.04]That's why I'm playing it.
[90:08.42]Oh, let's just give this to the Occultist.
[90:11.61]I mean, why not, right?
[90:15.17]I don't like the -2 dodge.
[90:16.23]I really don't.
[90:16.83]It's gone.
[90:17.69]I don't like that.
[90:20.71]I don't like that.
[90:22.53]I don't want it.
[90:24.31]Alright, we're gonna name somebody.
[90:25.93]We've got Torlaville.
[90:28.66]Okay, Torlaville.
[90:33.24]Alright, whose name is this gonna be?
[90:40.66]War of Walrus.
[90:43.57]200.
[90:44.91]First person I saw.
[90:46.25]That's literally the first fucking human being I saw type, so... War of Walrus, 200.
[90:50.41]Welcome to the team.
[90:54.95]No!
[90:55.55]Alright, Time Machine 9 is our main tank.
[91:02.26]And by main tank, I mean main guy.
[91:03.66]Let's do another mission.
[91:04.56]Let's go.
[91:06.16]I've upgraded some people.
[91:07.04]Let's see who we have available.
[91:08.16]Let's start this by stress.
[91:14.36]Who needs to go into the brothel?
[91:20.88]Okay, well, you obviously cannot go.
[91:23.64]Neither can you.
[91:24.22]Uh-oh.
[91:27.22]No, you can.
[91:27.76]She can come.
[91:28.58]As long as I bring the real Jerma and I can stress heal her.
[91:34.67]I need a tank, though.

[95:58.04]What, you wanted me to get all my guys killed?
[96:01.00]I'm playing this... I gotta play this smart.
[96:02.64]Darkest Dungeon is not a game where you can fuck around.
[96:04.53]This is perfect, by the way.
[96:06.41]Look at this easy mode.
[96:08.47]No backtracking.
[96:10.13]Not even one ounce of backtracking.
[96:13.49]Oh, he's selfish or something with klepto.
[96:16.01]Oh, fuck you, dude.

[96:18.61]I have to get rid of... Open up the sanitarium so I can get rid of that shit.
[96:21.17]I hate that.
[96:22.17]Kleptomania is my...
[96:25.78]Mechanical hazards possessed by evil intent.
[96:29.04]Kleptomania is my least favorite thing.
[96:31.93]I hate it.
[96:32.31]Alright.

[96:49.64]It's just quick and easy.
[96:55.69]I'll kill them both with the bills.
[97:00.07]Oh, that's too bad.
[97:01.57]Oh, no.
[97:04.21]What the heck?
[97:06.31]What the heck, man?
[97:09.96]Confidence surges as the enemy crumbles.
[97:13.76]I blew it.
[97:14.28]I didn't even blow it.
[97:21.31]Didn't even blow it.
[97:21.95]You guys thought I'd blow it.
[97:24.99]Didn't blow it.
[97:27.25]Look at that.
[97:27.63]Look at that confidence.
[97:32.63]Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer?
[97:34.49]No.
[97:34.83]If you don't have confidence, you'll never succeed.
[97:39.43]Uh... Should I dump a holy water on this?
[97:44.94]Holy water?
[97:47.48]What do you think?
[97:48.90]Holy this guy?
[97:49.82]Is that what this is for?

[98:25.28]Alright, let's get a good fucking round here.
[98:30.78]Okay, riposte.
[98:31.66]Should I just do this right off the bat?
[98:33.96]And smash this fucking guy right here?
[98:37.33]Forward one.

[99:09.96]I was hoping for a crit.
[99:11.30]Stun him now.
[99:16.10]These guys mark you, and that guy rends you.
[99:19.24]Ooh, excuse me, competent dog.
[99:23.43]See, these guys mark you, and this guy hits you for a bunch of damage if you mark.
[99:27.09]As long as that guy stays the fuck silent, I don't care.

[99:40.42]Everybody's buffed and now it's time to dive forward and then finale somebody because yeah Whatever whatever that means That's such a great move.

[101:18.69]Let's just go for Finale.
[101:21.07]I, like, want to Finale just for fun.
[101:25.37]Actually, I'll fuck him over if I move forward.
[101:31.38]Might not even get a chance to Finale.
[101:35.41]Alright, let me Finale.
[101:37.55]I like, I love the Finale.
[101:39.05]I'm going to heal because I want a Finale.
[101:40.52]Because I love the Finale animation.
[101:43.30]He just takes like a bow and like a spear goes through the bush.
[101:50.03]Alright, Finale.
[101:51.29]Here we go.
[101:52.11]Here comes the Finale.
[101:56.66]I love that.
[101:58.30]That's one of my favorite images in the game.
[102:00.20]The bow.
[102:02.42]Everyone's kind of fucked up here.
[102:10.66]That's what you get for touching that.
[102:11.92]You shouldn't have touched that.
[102:12.84]That was a big mistake.
[102:14.46]You idiot.
[102:14.70]Use the rope bow.
[102:15.04]You know, if it was in the game, I would.
[102:27.70]I got a shovel, right?
[102:31.54]Hmm.
[102:34.94]One HP, that sucks.
[102:42.64]Let's play a little magical tune.
[102:44.26]There we go.
[102:47.78]Nobody's close to shitting their pants, we're fine.
[102:49.42]Well, alright.
[102:59.34]How much health is six?
[103:01.00]This'll kill him.
[103:02.60]And nobody even got to do a move.
[103:04.54]See how fun this video game is?
[103:06.30]It took me a year to play it.
[103:07.12]Because I wanted to play it on the iPad.
[103:10.74]Here we go, here's a little early game challenge.
[103:30.35]These guys are all very annoying.
[103:34.81]I'll play Wheelman.
[103:37.77]No.
[103:40.71]I'm never going to play Wheelman ever again.
[103:43.68]Fuck.
[103:45.92]I'm going to have to Finale.
[103:48.22]He was supposed to be behind him.
[103:49.86]I fucked it up.
[103:51.22]It's alright though.
[103:53.50]forward one that fucks him over, but it's okay.
[103:56.19]Who cares?
[103:56.63]This guy, that's like the best move of the whole game.
[104:00.15]Like, who actually even cares?
[104:01.17]Oh, what's that?
[104:06.71]You just instantly get hurt.
[104:09.53]He's like so useless back here.
[104:13.71]That's fine.
[104:14.35]I'll move forward.
[104:22.11]What are we doing here?
[104:26.34]Grapeseed shot.
[104:29.24]Finale!
[104:32.39]Aww.
[104:34.07]I had an opportunity and I didn't use it.
[104:43.69]How many people have I killed in Darkest Dungeon?
[104:45.47]Zero.
[104:46.39]Where have we killed zero people?
[104:51.21]Um...
[104:56.20]Let's go, she's okay.
[104:59.00]Want to dodge?
[105:08.24]No, let's just heal everybody.
[105:12.97]That'll change problems.
[105:13.99]Oh, it absolutely will.
[105:14.91]Somebody will die.
[105:15.99]Don't you worry about that.
[105:24.55]Come on, hit me.
[105:30.25]Take a swing.
[105:31.30]Take a swing at the Highwayman.
[105:32.20]You know you want to.
[105:32.74]Or maybe you don't.
[105:44.10]Playing the music?
[105:45.80]Alright, didn't I forget to turn that down?
[105:51.37]What?
[105:51.75]How do you get a crit stun if it doesn't hit?
[105:53.75]That's horseshit.
[105:55.29]He'll die.
[105:56.77]Goodbye.
[106:00.75]Can't, like, heal or anything, though.
[106:05.08]Turn it up.
[106:06.90]Now pop up the jam, pop up the jam.
[106:09.54]Alright, uh... Let's put this on.
[106:21.58]Unholy abominations.
[106:23.76]Holy water, baby.
[106:27.48]This is where we use the holy water.
[106:28.66]We cleanse this.
[106:29.86]We cleanse it.
[106:32.62]Holy water purifies the altar.
[106:34.09]God-fearing quirk removed.
[106:36.21]Bingo.
[106:39.47]Finally, we get a scout.
[106:40.81]Let's see if there's one more.
[106:42.77]Of course, the last battle room is all the way in the end.
[106:45.83]Okay, that's fine.
[106:46.55]Sure.
[106:48.68]Sure.
[106:51.16]Let's go.
[106:51.74]Just keep going.
[106:53.34]There's a trap here.
[106:54.06]I'm not going to get hit by the fucking trap.
[106:57.02]Do not get hit by the trap.
[106:59.68]I beg of you.
[107:02.98]See you on the ground.
[107:04.96]There it is.
[107:05.44]Everybody's hungry.
[107:07.11]We're all hungry.
[107:08.03]I know.
[107:08.49]I understand.
[107:09.75]Disarmed it.
[107:11.95]Bingo.
[107:12.73]Alright, we're out of torches now.
[107:16.25]There's not a fight in here, but there's a fight coming up in the next one.
[107:18.49]There's two fights, actually.
[107:20.90]We're going to get down there quick before we lose light and I get too stressed out and everybody dies.
[107:29.60]You never want to hit backwards in this game.
[107:32.68]Nice.
[107:34.93]Good.
[107:36.83]Okay.
[107:37.35]Here comes a fight.
[107:38.61]Ah, it's getting dark.
[107:39.45]Come on.
[107:39.97]I should have brought an extra torch.
[107:42.91]Uh...
[107:50.16]I don't need the food anymore.
[107:51.54]Just pray I don't get a random roll before this fucking door.
[108:00.01]I'm instantly gonna finale this guy.
[108:05.01]Perfect.
[108:05.83]Come on.
[108:06.23]Just insta-kill everybody.
[108:07.77]No, don't give him a chance.
[108:11.78]What happens when the light goes out?
[108:13.68]The light, you get way more stressed.
[108:18.54]And it makes it so that the monsters are afraid.
[108:21.34]So I can get surprised more.
[108:23.18]The monsters do more damage.
[108:24.54]I get way more stressed, but there's more loot.
[108:27.96]Fuck off, really?
[108:28.82]Come on.
[108:29.92]How did I miss that?
[108:30.58]For now.
[108:35.59]Yeah, you get a lot more stuff.
[108:38.17]But... He said it.
[108:39.11]There it is.
[108:39.55]You guys were looking for that.
[108:41.25]He said it.
[108:42.01]He said the thing.
[108:47.81]Are we good?
[108:48.55]This is the last fight.
[108:50.67]Yeah, we're fine.
[108:51.39]Let's go.
[108:56.53]I think she has a move that can make the torch lighter, right?
[108:59.90]Let's go with this first.
[109:05.76]Cue the credits.
[109:09.90]These are the easiest enemies in the game, I would say.
[109:12.10]If you get four spiders, you're going to win.
[109:18.79]I say that now as I'm getting my ass kicked.
[109:21.69]Uh, I might be able to just grapeseed shot a bunch of people and then... Yeah.
[109:26.41]That's gonna be perfect.
[109:27.49]Perfect!
[109:31.38]Show them the bills, and then kill the next guy.
[109:33.42]That stun's fun.
[109:38.18]Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer, apparently.
[109:44.50]That's what I'm talking about.
[109:45.36]That's exactly what I needed to have happen.
[109:46.90]Overconfidence?
[109:48.00]Not enough confidence.
[109:49.64]Show him the bells.
[110:10.11]That's the kind of shit that happens to you in this game though.
[110:16.25]That's the kind of shit that will happen and this guy's my gesture has been stun blocked the whole game Okay.
[110:21.89]Alright.
[110:23.05]Come on.
[110:24.13]Give me a break show them the bills.
[110:26.65]Thank you And then kill this motherfucker Finale Just add it and everything's gonna be fine
[110:39.57]We're good.
[110:40.57]I do have to get rid of a lot of these dumb things, though.
[110:43.41]Um... Put in 15 gold, 25 gold, 20 to get rid of this.
[110:52.97]This is fucking Karaz.
[110:56.31]Let's go.
[110:57.33]There's no chest in here, so we can just end the mission.
[110:59.68]Nobody shit their pants.
[111:00.84]Got a lot of pages of our diary.
[111:08.65]This is like Dark Souls?
[111:09.39]Yeah, this is just like Dark Souls.
[111:13.17]If you like Dark Souls, you will love this game.
[111:20.52]Why didn't I use the anti-venom?
[111:21.80]Who fucking cares?
[111:24.72]Level 2?
[111:25.40]Yes, there we go.
[111:26.30]Resolve level up.
[111:28.47]So we're good.
[111:33.72]only uh two much more damage versus eldritch and crit problems okay well he's level two now like Dark Souls oh it's such a soulslike a fresh spirit some uh a sanguine memory sometimes you get these random events stress reduction activities in town are slightly less effective
[111:56.40]Okay, well, that's kind of annoying, but whatever.
[111:59.65]Uh, so if you excuse me for just a moment, I'm gonna pee.
[112:02.77]I'm gonna pee.
[112:03.29]I'll be right back.
[112:04.93]Continue our trek.
[112:06.17]And we'll try to kill a boss.
[112:06.97]I'll be right back. ...
[112:38.23]you
[113:26.46]Thank you.
[114:46.02]Let me just open up my drink that I just purchased on the internet.
[114:58.98]What are you guys thinking?
[115:00.94]In another 30 or 40 years, do you think we're going to be able to buy drinks on the internet?
[115:07.75]By the way, this is too loud.
[115:09.27]40.
[115:09.47]It's too loud.
[115:14.92]You know what I mean?
[115:16.56]This is too low.
[115:18.98]Better.
[115:19.64]Come on.
[115:21.63]Imagine being able to buy a drink on the internet.
[115:24.17]When I say buy it, no, no, no, no, no.
[115:26.30]That's not what I'm talking about.
[115:27.02]I'm talking about...
[115:30.01]I'm talking about you purchase it, like, on Amazon.
[115:32.95]And, like, a vending machine out the front of your disk drive is like... It just comes out.
[115:37.13]And in the back of your computer is a gigantic tube that goes... Look.
[115:42.19]Look, the first person... Remember when the internet was first a thing?
[115:44.78]The guy that erected the first, like, internet pole?
[115:48.50]Cables and shit?
[115:49.88]All coaxial wires?
[115:51.12]The guy that invented coaxial.
[115:53.27]is a trillionaire, and his entire family owns, like, a third of Nebraska, right?
[115:58.81]So, the first guy that makes the tube, right, TM, that's connected to all the streets, they're gonna have tubes on them, and you can press a button and, like, Futurama style, but not a person goes in it, a fucking drink goes in it.
[116:15.44]First person that makes a tube is gonna win a bunch of money in the contest.
[116:20.82]Alright, treatments, yes, I unlocked the sanitarium.
[116:25.94]No, you're going to have the internet and you're going to have the tube system.
[116:30.64]The coaxial... It's not going to get better.
[116:35.01]Internet speeds are going to stay pretty much the same.
[116:38.01]This is extremely expensive.
[116:40.95]Let's take this.
[116:45.67]First of all, let me see something here.
[116:48.67]Let's embark.
[116:49.08]Let me look at this.
[116:51.78]Get off of this.
[116:54.60]Stress.
[116:55.94]Who can not come on the next mission?
[116:58.34]I might need to do a little shit bomb mission.
[116:59.84]You know what I mean?
[117:01.28]Oh, wait a minute.
[117:01.86]Did we unlock anything else?
[117:02.98]Sure.
[117:03.28]This is goals.
[117:08.10]These are all good.
[117:08.58]We can go to the cove now.
[117:09.85]Cove and the warrens.
[117:11.55]We'll go to the cove next.
[117:14.27]Cove is interesting.
[117:14.83]It's a bunch of fish.
[117:18.93]Has anybody shit their pants yet?
[117:20.35]One person has.
[117:21.05]Yes.
[117:22.55]We have one pants shit.
[117:25.71]I kind of want to give this to the leper.
[117:32.35]Like, who gives a shit?
[117:33.73]That's really bad to lose that much dodge, but he's going to do more damage.
[117:36.31]That's fine.
[117:37.27]I'm okay with that.
[117:40.74]I wanted to change that out, so he'll be coming on this mission.
[117:47.72]Take the jester again.
[117:48.62]I don't like going and getting a bunch of people early.
[117:57.85]Just because... I don't know.
[118:01.61]I feel... Going to the wagon and getting, like, four more people just kind of overwhelms me.
[118:06.61]I can really only work with, like, 10 to 12 people at a time.
[118:09.87]Let alone, like, 25.
[118:13.00]Anyways.
[118:13.94]This person has to go.
[118:14.94]These three have to go into... I could bring him again.
[118:18.02]I could level him up again, too.
[118:24.46]Hmm...
[118:29.79]I'm okay with this.
[118:30.33]It's a lot of range, but as long as it doesn't fuck up the... Yeah, this will be okay.
[118:35.99]Yeah, this will be fine.
[118:40.01]Get this... Get this... Get war machine.
[118:43.25]War walrus.
[118:47.82]The fish are resistant to blight, right?
[118:49.94]So I probably shouldn't bring Plague Doctor there.
[118:51.70]That's fine.
[118:56.58]What else you got?
[118:58.90]Mark.
[118:59.36]That's good.
[118:59.90]Suppressing fire.
[119:00.62]This is okay.
[119:04.02]And he's got his shit.
[119:06.54]He's got his thing on.
[119:07.67]Okay.
[119:09.57]Oh, the fish are the ones that are resistant to bleed.
[119:11.59]Okay.
[119:14.79]The fish are weak to blight.
[119:17.07]I need to heal her, though.
[119:18.17]Alright.
[119:20.28]Sorry.
[119:20.76]Sorry, Walrus.
[119:23.26]Fuck.
[119:23.46]I need a new healer.
[119:26.35]These two are too stressed out.
[119:28.13]Alright, is there any other healers?
[119:31.15]Yeah, okay, there's another one.
[119:32.09]There's another Etalyx.
[119:34.59]To fight the abyss, one must know it.
[119:38.33]So we're gonna name, it's gonna be somebody in chat and Etalyx.
[119:43.05]So, like, who is it?
[119:44.74]Who's it gonna be?
[119:50.30]Um...
[119:53.36]Hey, what was it?
[119:54.24]What was it?
[119:54.88]Hey, hey, hey, hey, Disney.
[119:58.76]Is that the person's name?
[119:59.42]I was going to write Etalyx edition.
[120:06.85]There you go.
[120:08.37]Hey, hey, Disney Etalyx.
[120:16.12]Is that person even in the chat?
[120:17.96]Wait, wait, wait.
[120:18.66]Did I get it right?
[120:21.56]Let's go down to the H's.
[120:22.38]I need to make sure that I got this right.
[120:27.25]Hey.
[120:29.31]Hey.
[120:30.33]I got it, yeah.
[120:31.15]Hey, Divny.
[120:32.79]I got it right.
[120:36.19]But it has to be Etalyx.
[120:37.95]Always.
[120:38.25]Does this guy even have his heel?
[120:41.67]Look at the stab thing.
[120:44.91]That's fine.
[120:47.54]He's not going to like being where he is, but that's okay.
[120:49.64]As long as he can heal, I don't really give a shit about anything else.
[120:58.00]So, let's go with this.
[121:05.57]That's okay.
[121:06.65]That's good.
[121:07.75]I'm okay with this.
[121:09.11]And we're going to go to the cove.
[121:11.47]And we're going to blight the fuck out of these fish freaks.
[121:19.05]Mod me.
[121:20.76]You already are modded.
[121:24.76]This is short, right?
[121:26.18]Yeah.
[121:26.36]Let's go six.
[121:32.54]I don't like taking that.
[121:34.11]Light's not a huge deal.
[121:35.97]As long as you're somewhere in the middle, or 70% of the way.
[121:40.19]Once you start getting trinkets that require light, that's when it gets to be an issue.
[121:46.52]Oh, if the light above 75, you do 20% more damage.
[121:49.68]That's when you start to actually have to care about torchlight.
[121:58.43]At least get seven.
[122:00.67]Seven's an unlucky number.
[122:02.37]Six is the lucky number.
[122:06.98]Okay, fine.
[122:07.60]Okay.
[122:09.88]Okay.
[122:11.00]I did it.
[122:13.74]Okay.
[122:14.50]Fine.
[122:15.16]And a bandage.
[122:16.84]I don't know why I did that.
[122:23.50]Nine is better?
[122:24.14]No.
[122:26.60]Seven isn't a lucky number.
[122:28.56]You know what the luckiest number in the world is?
[122:30.42]13.
[122:30.50]It is.
[122:30.79]13.
[122:30.81]You know that 13 is a lucky number in other countries?
[122:46.89]I don't have any holy water.
[122:48.41]It's alright.
[122:53.76]Stashed heirlooms.
[122:54.66]Perfect.
[122:57.62]Zero is the unlucky number.
[123:00.32]There's no such thing as an unlucky number.
[123:03.72]Excuse me, don't you know the Taylor Swift?
[123:06.69]Look up Taylor Swift 13.
[123:07.83]And you tell me that 13's an unlucky number.
[123:12.33]Taylor Swift's 13 is her lucky number.
[123:14.23]How do you think that happened?
[123:15.03]She's like the most successful person in the world.
[123:18.16]She has more money than Bill Gates.
[123:21.16]I want to do this.
[123:21.74]I want to get him up to the front.
[123:24.90]Um, right in the back.
[123:26.62]Gotta kill this guy in the back.
[123:30.03]Stress wave.
[123:30.63]You gotta die quick.
[123:31.69]Thank God.
[123:32.79]Bird Jerma blocked it.
[123:39.76]Okay, the people in the back no longer need to be attacked.
[123:43.50]No... Ah, yes they do.
[123:45.94]That sucks.
[123:48.08]Drop the damage on you.
[123:50.00]And we'll debuff you.
[123:50.84]That's a damage debuff.
[123:51.86]He resisted it.
[123:52.55]What a great video game.
[123:56.07]His 10% fucking 15% debuff chance.
[123:59.61]Great.
[124:04.39]So this is just a super amount of damage.
[124:06.04]We're not going to do that.
[124:08.31]We're going to try... No, this is not going to work.
[124:13.39]Because he's guarded and he has a ton of protection.
[124:15.63]So I'm just going to make myself a fucking mute.
[124:20.54]The next round I'll be fucking unbeatable.
[124:23.82]Dead.
[124:26.73]This guy is probably dead too.
[124:31.45]10% equals 50%, seems about right.
[124:33.55]Yeah, I know, right?
[124:35.23]Darkest Dungeon, more like... weighted dice, the video game.
[124:39.29]I don't know, I could bleed.
[124:42.51]He's gonna know, I can't bleed him, I have to blight him.
[124:44.66]I'll bleed this guy.
[124:48.02]Oh fuck, he has the guard on, I'm an idiot!
[124:49.60]Ayayayayayayayay!
[124:54.22]Can't dodge that.
[125:02.01]Pretty much.
[125:03.95]I don't want to do it.
[125:13.35]Just do that.
[125:14.19]He's really stressed out though.
[125:15.31]This is not good.
[125:19.23]Perfect.
[125:21.03]I don't like that.
[125:24.23]My Time Machine 9 might die in this dungeon.
[125:30.64]He's not marked, but he's got too much protection.
[125:32.74]Just have to keep, like, bleh.
[125:34.21]I don't even know.
[125:36.25]I guess just do this again.
[125:37.21]Try to just revenge him.
[125:42.07]Stack it.
[125:42.43]Come on.
[125:43.61]Yes!
[125:43.87]He's dead.
[125:44.97]Sayonara.
[125:46.99]You're dead.
[125:47.67]Next turn.
[125:48.11]See you, Blader.
[125:49.13]See you, Blader!
[125:52.58]Okay, we're good.
[126:00.79]Heirloom chest.
[126:01.47]A chest with my sigil on it.
[126:03.55]Open it!
[126:06.61]Wow, that's awful.
[126:08.31]A bunch of useless crap.
[126:11.48]Finally a scout though.
[126:15.24]It's a battle room.
[126:17.49]Okay, we have to just beat all the battle rooms.
[126:18.95]So I'm going to hope that there's no battle room down here.
[126:21.45]It's just there's like two over here.
[126:23.83]So that's okay.
[126:26.82]I want to move... I want to move you over here.
[126:33.16]Yes.
[126:34.10]Yes, I do.
[126:40.67]Keep going.
[126:42.55]I see it.
[126:43.09]I see it.
[126:47.77]I want him to disarm it because he will get all the benefits of it.
[126:52.17]I don't want him to open that chest because if it's bad, then he'll get stress.
[126:56.84]I want this guy to be able to do the cool things to make him get stress reduced.
[127:00.56]Where's the masseuse?
[127:06.18]Here's a fight.
[127:06.88]I think we're good.
[127:07.56]Yes, we are.
[127:10.88]So is this like a video game or what?
[127:13.04]This guy's got to go.
[127:14.92]One thing I know about this guy is he explodes.
[127:17.90]This guy fucking explodes and like kills everybody, so he has to die like immediately.
[127:23.06]Uh... That guy does a lot of damage.
[127:29.43]Okay, let's... Go forward, hit this guy.
[127:36.04]Get rid of this exploding boomer.
[127:38.88]Play grenade.
[127:39.46]Hit them both!
[127:41.88]Yes!
[127:50.64]Going good so far.
[127:52.66]That's not good.
[127:53.54]That's actually really bad.
[127:56.49]Oh, God.
[127:57.25]The Blight has to kill him before he does it.
[128:00.89]Please have the Blight kill him before he explodes.
[128:02.87]I got lucky.
[128:05.33]Because I really think he would have blown up and killed somebody.
[128:10.75]Because I don't have to worry about him now.
[128:12.49]So I'm just going to Noxious Fumes this guy.
[128:16.41]Plague Doctor is so good.
[128:22.72]It's four.
[128:23.30]He's got three health.
[128:23.98]He'll be fine.
[128:24.84]Okay.
[128:25.30]Well, just whack him.
[128:31.55]And heal.
[128:33.95]Perfect roll.
[128:34.67]I like it.
[128:35.59]I'm liking these perfect rolls.
[128:36.95]It's a good thing.
[128:42.03]Blade Doctor is best waifu.
[128:45.17]It's a great character.
[128:52.60]It is the best character.
[128:59.53]Scout.
[129:04.73]I do like where he was, though.
[129:05.78]This is concerning me because he's probably going to get stressed out.
[129:10.42]The problem is when you get to a boss.
[129:12.42]We're sitting okay.
[129:13.92]We've been playing for a couple hours.
[129:15.70]This is like the introduction.
[129:20.53]Here come these idiots.
[129:24.82]I definitely want to do this to the guy in the back.
[129:30.48]Now, come on.
[129:31.32]Come and get me.
[129:32.82]Drop the damage on... On him.
[129:36.50]I hate these guys.
[129:37.42]God, fuck you.
[129:38.16]Come on.
[129:38.82]This is why I wanted to do that.
[129:41.97]I don't like getting hit by that.
[129:43.57]It's annoying.
[129:44.15]It makes me annoyed.
[129:44.99]It makes me annoyed getting hit by that.
[129:53.55]The Flatulence is better than the Plague Doctor, isn't it?
[129:56.65]I have never even seen it.
[129:57.43]I'm sure we'll see it soon.
[130:00.79]And he's dead.
[130:01.83]Is he?
[130:02.03]No.
[130:02.33]That's too bad.
[130:07.62]I don't trust like that.
[130:08.80]Is that what I said?
[130:10.10]I don't trust like that?
[130:18.32]The Flatulence is broken.
[130:21.49]Like, broken in a good way or broken in a bad way?
[130:26.59]Don't open that.
[130:28.35]Okay.
[130:29.95]That's too bad.
[130:32.15]Hard skin.
[130:35.82]Okay.
[130:36.72]This guy's got... A lot of, like, just good stuff.
[130:42.54]I really wish I got that on... The leper, though.
[130:46.43]Oh, well.
[130:46.69]That would have completely negated his, uh...
[130:52.01]It's okay.
[130:53.14]Can't win them all.
[130:57.82]Get in there.
[130:58.98]Damn it!
[130:59.40]I hate going backwards.
[131:08.35]Battle room.
[131:10.61]Damn it.
[131:12.75]A lot of battle rooms.
[131:13.55]Usually there's only like two or three.
[131:15.97]That would be one, two, three.
[131:17.32]Oh, there's three.
[131:17.86]Heh.
[131:23.05]There's an ambush here.
[131:25.39]Just be weary about it, be weary.
[131:29.74]These guys are lead resistant, that's fine.
[131:31.58]That hurt a lot though.
[131:42.59]Plague doctor's gonna have to do some work here.
[131:44.67]Ow.
[131:51.60]I'm only going to hit one guy in the back.
[131:52.78]That sucks.
[131:58.12]Grape seeded him.
[132:02.24]These are all such good rolls.
[132:03.21]I swear to God, guys, when I was playing this on my own, I was not getting these rolls.
[132:07.91]Fuck.
[132:09.97]It's not good.
[132:12.77]Grape it up.
[132:20.08]What the hell is going on here?
[132:22.56]What is this?
[132:23.85]Watching you play got me into it and figured I'd at least share the revenue.
[132:26.65]Darkest Dungeon Twitch Bundle?
[132:30.49]There's a twitch.tv, but, well, thanks, soup, but that, what is that?
[132:34.31]He's gonna die.
[132:34.85]I gotta be careful.
[132:36.60]He'll die from that.
[132:38.58]Okay, now they're both gonna die from this blade.
[132:40.94]This blade.
[132:42.24]I hit the guy in the back.
[132:44.15]Can I hit the guy in the back?
[132:45.17]Fuck, I can't.
[132:45.85]I mean, I can, but that's not gonna do it.
[132:48.75]It's not gonna kill him.
[132:53.19]I hope I can shoot him or something.
[132:54.59]God damn it.
[132:57.23]I get money if they buy the people rank on my page.
[133:01.53]Oh, I forgot that was even like a feature.
[133:03.42]Well, that's cool.
[133:06.58]If you buy it through Twitch.
[133:09.74]Yeah, I know he's bleeding.
[133:10.60]Yeah, that's cool.
[133:14.88]We're going to grapeseed extract.
[133:16.36]No, we're not.
[133:18.13]That guy's dead anyway.
[133:20.43]Alright.
[133:28.46]The problem with the Plague Doctor is... If there's not a full team of four that you're going against...
[133:38.52]It's kind of... He's kind of bad.
[133:41.33]You really want to use those play grenades.
[133:42.93]The grenades are the best because they hit two people in the back row.
[133:45.87]Otherwise, you're just lobbing.
[133:48.29]We got two more.
[133:49.11]Yeah, I need to use a couple of these.
[133:56.99]Unfortunately.
[133:57.55]This is a fight in here and I don't want to fucking die in here.
[134:07.99]Fuck.
[134:09.77]God.
[134:11.07]Alright, let's go.
[134:11.65]We gotta kill the stress people.
[134:15.53]They're the ones that are the worst.
[134:16.71]They're the worst.
[134:19.37]And damage.
[134:20.19]This guy does the damage.
[134:21.21]I'm not gonna starve.
[134:25.04]I got plenty of food.
[134:26.70]There we go.
[134:27.14]Plague doctor.
[134:29.38]Damn it.
[134:30.02]That's unfortunate.
[134:30.96]If that was a two HP hit, that would've been perfect.
[134:38.20]Just pick away.
[134:40.17]Pick away.
[134:40.81]What is that?
[134:44.49]What the fuck is that?
[134:45.11]What is that?
[134:45.95]What's this?
[134:46.63]Is this violence?
[134:51.93]He's dead next turn, so that's okay.
[134:55.25]He's not dead next turn.
[134:59.60]Oh, plague Dr. Pepper.
[135:01.14]Plague Dr. Pepper.
[135:04.86]Oh, you asshole.
[135:05.94]Oh well.
[135:07.68]That's fine.
[135:08.86]They're both dead because this isn't going to stack.
[135:11.80]Fucking resisted it.
[135:13.72]You idiot!
[135:14.50]You idiot!
[135:15.32]You idiot!
[135:16.98]God damn it!
[135:18.77]You idiot!
[135:20.23]Uh-oh.
[135:23.97]This could get hairy here in a second.
[135:28.23]The flesh is knit.
[135:31.81]They're both dead on the next turn.
[135:33.11]Unless he heals the guy.
[135:34.39]No, he's not even gonna get a chance.
[135:35.79]Stop getting stressed out!
[135:37.98]He just got scratched in the face.
[135:39.42]He's fine.
[135:41.66]Alright.
[135:42.40]Here we go.
[135:43.76]It's time to do the Philips Hue!
[135:51.94]How do you miss that?
[135:52.98]You fucking idiot.
[135:57.97]He's dead.
[135:59.91]What's his bleed chance?
[136:00.77]Meh, it's not even worth doing.
[136:02.05]Just shoot him.
[136:05.03]No, I could just... Yeah.
[136:06.37]Just turn it on again.
[136:08.15]Might as well.
[136:13.18]Stun... Nope.
[136:15.58]Blight.
[136:17.34]There it is.
[136:18.52]Bye.
[136:20.47]I can get one more heal off on you.
[136:25.29]He's already bleeding, so it's not going to matter.
[136:26.75]I'm going to use this after the fight.
[136:31.74]The Philips Hue driver.
[136:33.74]Yeah, watch out for that Philips Hue driver.
[136:46.62]Fuck.
[136:48.40]I just took it off.
[136:49.36]Get it off again.
[136:50.30]Come on.
[136:51.56]What is this?
[136:53.98]I still have another big fight to do.
[136:57.88]Yeah, I might have two big fights.
[136:59.16]If this is another battle room, then I have to do it.
[137:00.62]I know that line.
[137:14.59]Why did I... I should have let him do that!
[137:17.45]Pay attention!
[137:19.32]Come on, dude!
[137:20.42]Pay attention to the game!
[137:21.58]That is all damage in one stress.
[137:28.78]Stress guy gotta go immediately.
[137:30.64]Every time.
[137:34.03]This guy can fuck up the whole entire game.
[137:36.55]Simply by existing.
[137:41.23]Does he got 5 HP?
[137:45.95]Who does more damage?
[137:50.44]They both do, like, the same, don't they?
[137:53.12]Oh, get at the guy in front, though.
[138:00.38]It's a pull, right?
[138:02.53]Ooh, easy.
[138:04.61]Easy, Plague Doctor.
[138:08.11]Oh, easy.
[138:09.61]Easy.
[138:10.01]Nice.
[138:10.89]Okay.
[138:12.33]Uh, this is where we gotta be careful.
[138:19.30]I need a good crit heal.
[138:22.22]This will kill them both.
[138:23.93]Oh my god, why?
[138:25.69]Does it have to do that?
[138:26.55]Why does it have to do that?
[138:27.71]It would have killed this guy.
[138:28.69]Why?
[138:31.23]You fucking dodge.
[138:32.99]That's such... Ah!
[138:35.47]Yeah, dodge this.
[138:45.28]And that should be it, right?
[138:46.42]Yes.
[138:48.76]Goodbye.
[138:49.06]I got a key out of that.
[138:51.00]Hey, that's it.
[138:53.45]I got a key.
[138:53.81]I got a key.
[138:54.67]We're going.
[139:13.61]We're fine.
[139:14.35]No issue.
[139:15.52]Not yet at least.
[139:17.08]We're good.
[139:17.74]Boomer inbound.
[139:46.32]Like him.
[139:47.30]Get him with one swing.
[139:48.40]Ooh, you're getting close.
[139:55.91]You're getting close.
[139:56.71]4 HP, he's dead.
[139:59.05]Yeah, this is the bug zapper.
[140:04.43]Now you're super dead.
[140:10.14]Die.
[140:11.78]Die.
[140:17.75]It was worth... Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[140:24.61]Okay.
[140:25.37]We're reminded.
[140:28.01]This was worth doing because I just got like six more heirlooms.
[140:31.46]So... What should I do?
[140:33.64]Should I throw in the medicine?
[140:36.78]Should I throw this medicine in there?
[140:42.84]Should I cleanse?
[140:43.56]Like heal this plant?
[140:53.64]Known cheat removed.
[140:55.48]Oh, nice.
[140:57.22]Okay, this could be a battle, so I gotta be careful.
[140:59.28]Let's eat the rest of the food, just in case this is a fight.
[141:01.36]It really might be, and it could blow everything, so... Let's go.
[141:08.33]Well, no.
[141:09.33]It's nothing.
[141:10.39]All dungeon clear.
[141:11.31]Complete.
[141:11.69]Let's go.
[141:13.15]Not a weak grip, I know, right?
[141:16.41]Of course not.
[141:30.34]Campy, I did all the battles.
[141:32.94]You know, you're right.
[141:34.16]But it was worth doing to get the extra, like, six crests.
[141:38.63]I would say.
[141:42.35]Now, have we unlocked a... Ooh.
[141:44.61]That's good.
[141:45.91]I think we've faded.
[141:47.03]Chance to turn any miss into a hit.
[141:51.10]Sounds pretty fucking great, actually.
[141:56.96]Oh, there he is.
[142:00.10]This is the new guy.
[142:05.80]Okay, so I've never seen this person.
[142:08.14]What the fuck?
[142:11.78]So he's a bunch of bleeds?
[142:14.49]Okay, hold on.
[142:15.73]Wait, wait, wait.
[142:19.53]Punish some melee.
[142:23.39]There's no damage debuff on it.
[142:25.59]Four points for three rounds.
[142:29.56]Okay.
[142:31.38]This is also bleed.
[142:32.16]It's two people in the back.
[142:34.73]Two points for three rounds.
[142:36.41]And debuffs their bleed resistance.
[142:38.15]Jesus.
[142:42.27]I can only do this below 50% health.
[142:45.25]So I heal 33% max HP and heal myself 34% max HP.
[142:53.48]But lose a shitload of damage, dodge, and speed.
[142:55.94]What?
[142:57.88]What?
[143:02.63]What the fuck?
[143:06.05]Okay.
[143:08.75]Suffer.
[143:10.29]Clear marked.
[143:11.35]Transfer bleed and transfer blight to me.
[143:15.72]And this marks... Hold on.
[143:17.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[143:20.22]So I get 30% protection and deathblow resistance.
[143:23.98]But I get marked.
[143:25.26]So I clear mark, transfer debuffs, and get marked myself and 30% protection.
[143:35.75]Okay, but this is a stress heal.
[143:39.29]That's pretty great.
[143:41.74]Reclaim.
[143:42.28]Heal one point for two rounds.
[143:43.98]It was a hot.
[143:45.64]But you make yourself bleed.
[143:48.52]This guy's a little complicated.
[143:49.72]Alright.
[143:52.44]Extinguish.
[143:54.99]Five points for three rounds bleed and you make yourself, you heal yourself but lose damage.
[143:59.13]This guy's fucking weird, man.
[144:06.50]Um... I'm gonna name this one myself.
[144:16.37]Fucking Yardamite.
[144:18.85]There he is.
[144:19.39]The Yardamite.
[144:23.47]So he's a front of the line person.
[144:24.75]Okay.
[144:27.51]Name him me.
[144:31.83]Alright.
[144:32.05]Stress.
[144:32.57]Who's stressed?
[144:35.63]You're okay.
[144:36.73]You're not okay.
[144:41.81]Neither are you.
[144:45.46]You're okay.
[144:47.66]But still.
[144:48.60]No, you can't get... I can't whip this person.
[144:53.08]You can't... What's wrong with you?
[144:55.81]Well, only meditate shit.
[144:59.79]Obsessed with food.
[145:00.85]I gotta... I can... Hmm...
[145:09.57]I want to try the flagellant guy.
[145:14.30]That stress is okay.
[145:15.92]Do we have anything new here?
[145:20.22]Explore.
[145:22.36]Explore.
[145:23.38]Explore.
[145:23.90]Complete the broom battles.
[145:27.71]Okay.
[145:28.37]No bosses yet.
[145:32.95]We do have a medium.
[145:34.47]I think it's time to do a medium dungeon.
[145:41.08]Do pig town with the flagellant.
[145:49.22]We haven't done one here, have we, in the warrens?
[145:52.50]Ooh!
[145:54.24]Okay.
[145:54.91]Well, let's do that.
[146:00.41]Let's bring these both.
[146:01.81]Level them both up.
[146:03.91]So, bleeds.
[146:05.19]We need a bunch of bleed people.
[146:06.73]But wait, shouldn't that...
[146:10.76]Pig Town Flatulence.
[146:13.74]This is going to take a little bit for me to figure out how this works.
[146:15.62]So, like, it's all a bunch of bleeds.
[146:18.74]And he drops people's bleed resistance.
[146:20.34]So I should bring other people that have bleeds.
[146:22.32]I don't think I can fucking... Where's the Jester?
[146:26.83]He has a bleed, but I don't use it.
[146:28.19]Alright, I'm going to take off this and put it on the bleed.
[146:37.58]Still have Finale, so that's fine.
[146:42.47]What's my opinion of SCORN?
[146:45.29]I actually... I noticed that that was coming up, and I don't even really know what it is.
[146:50.70]That's blight, not bleed.
[146:54.26]Does she have a bleed?
[146:58.65]No.
[146:59.73]It's alright, though.
[147:00.15]You can just snipe from the back.
[147:02.11]That's fine.
[147:02.63]You can put marks on people and stuff.
[147:05.61]Use your sniper shot.
[147:08.77]Well, isn't SCORN the game that was in development?
[147:12.31]Or, like, was supposed to be in development for, like, a million years or something?
[147:19.29]This guy is technically a tank.
[147:22.01]So we need a support.
[147:22.74]I could bring... Hey, Diphne Etalyx.
[147:30.14]Or I could bring Egg Salad.
[147:35.14]Hmm.
[147:35.34]Hmm.
[147:41.28]I'm going to bring... Yeah.
[147:46.34]It fits in there better.
[147:47.16]Okay.
[147:48.80]Let's try it.
[147:51.00]Let's try this little party here.
[147:52.46]A bunch of level zeros.
[147:55.87]This one's short.
[147:56.51]I get a flatulent... Flatulent hood.
[148:00.47]So let's do it.
[148:04.65]Flatulent is a balancing act because you want him stressed out and damaged to do some more work, but not too much.
[148:10.54]Okay.
[148:12.92]I feel ya.
[148:15.28]This is short.
[148:21.67]7 and 10.
[148:21.85]It's good enough.
[148:23.65]Take a key, take a shovel.
[148:26.61]And I've got a lot.
[148:28.01]After this, I've got to upgrade some buildings.
[148:30.53]I do this.
[148:31.29]I'm a hoarder.
[148:32.51]I'm like a resource hoarder.
[148:34.12]So bad.
[148:42.20]Trinkets.
[148:44.42]Sorry.
[148:44.70]It's just a short mission.
[148:48.77]It's fine.
[148:49.33]Oh, Jesus.
[148:50.41]Interesting.
[148:51.17]Well, at least we don't have to backtrack.
[148:55.99]That's a good thing.
[148:58.51]So I want him stressed.
[149:03.00]Well, ow.
[149:04.28]Didn't see that.
[149:05.52]Not fucking this time.
[149:12.83]Well, 30- oh my god, this guy's already that stressed out?
[149:21.07]He's already like halfway to, uh, insanity.
[149:28.00]So I- come on!
[149:30.70]How am I not seeing these?
[149:32.90]Like, am I- am I missing something here?
[149:44.62]Alright, let's see.
[149:45.16]Oh, he's interesting looking.
[149:49.70]Welcome to the Warrens.
[149:52.04]I know, right?
[149:53.94]Uh, let's... Should I let him get stressed out?
[149:57.48]I feel like I shouldn't be letting him do that.
[150:03.46]Yeah, there was a shovel and a barrel.
[150:04.84]Let him.
[150:05.12]Holy fuck, that was 15 damage crit.
[150:15.77]Oh my god.
[150:17.35]Jesus, what the fuck?
[150:20.54]Like I'm getting smashed.
[150:25.78]She's bleeding.
[150:26.84]Okay, good to see you.
[150:32.40]Okay, so transfer bleed and blight.
[150:37.16]So let's try this.
[150:40.26]Let's do this right now.
[150:43.83]He took it all.
[150:45.45]And now he has more protections.
[150:48.03]Right?
[150:49.62]Something like that.
[150:50.24]That's actually really cool.
[151:01.29]So you're just supposed to punish this guy.
[151:09.46]I'm assuming he gets 30% protection.
[151:11.82]That's good.
[151:13.56]That would have done 10 damage.
[151:18.00]Well, he is getting his ass kicked.
[151:21.38]This guy's just taped up to the wall and we're throwing darts at him.
[151:27.42]I don't like that move.
[151:30.32]I could do the Bolas.
[151:33.14]Let's mark the person in the back.
[151:37.49]He gets off on it.
[151:41.13]No, hit the guy in the front.
[151:43.71]He gets off on it.
[151:48.08]Well, I think it's time to finale somebody.
[151:53.30]He'll die.
[151:55.42]Finale the guy in the front.
[152:02.95]He's going to be bleeding again.
[152:03.85]No, he's good.
[152:06.19]But I want to keep him below, like, 40%, right?
[152:12.05]Like, so for instance, this is a bleed.
[152:15.65]So it's just... Wow, you can go into the third row.
[152:22.35]Did he just hit himself in the back?
[152:23.77]I think he did.
[152:24.77]He whacked himself in the back.
[152:26.31]Jesus.
[152:35.13]So don't heal this guy.
[152:40.93]Okay.
[152:42.52]I guess.
[152:43.48]Why can I not Finale?
[152:45.64]I want a Finale!
[152:51.74]Okay, so heal 33%.
[152:52.70]But then I lose all my damage.
[153:03.60]Can I do it to myself?
[153:04.56]No.
[153:08.80]But I do heal.
[153:10.26]Myself.
[153:14.32]I guess I can heal him.
[153:18.80]Then you kind of just go back to square one.
[153:20.64]Alright, I get it.
[153:26.66]Good night.
[153:29.84]Free heal, yeah.
[153:37.50]Medicinal herbs.
[153:39.42]Barbaric rituals.
[153:47.77]Oh, god damn it.
[153:50.19]Rapturous?
[153:50.41]What is that?
[153:50.75]What is rapturous?
[154:01.95]What does that mean?
[154:02.55]What is Rapturous?
[154:13.62]He's just buffed up now?
[154:14.78]Oh.
[154:15.30]Okay.
[154:15.48]I guess.
[154:16.67]It's a unique affliction only he can get.
[154:31.86]What, did he just do like a dickload of damage now?
[154:37.54]Let's see.
[154:43.40]Jesus.
[154:44.04]Okay.
[154:49.68]These guys suck.
[154:50.50]He hits harder and dodges less.
[154:52.86]He causes stress to other people.
[154:55.59]Well, alright.
[155:03.74]He's a little weird for me.
[155:07.04]I'm not sure I like that.
[155:08.98]He's a little weird.
[155:14.97]Getting close.
[155:17.59]There are at least two more battles.
[155:20.15]Fuck.
[155:20.75]I think this is going to be a wash.
[155:22.31]I think these guys are all dead.
[155:23.83]How have I not collected any fucking loot either?
[155:28.80]You open it.
[155:34.74]I have two pictures.
[155:36.25]I have two shitty portraits.
[155:40.05]That's it.
[155:40.97]Okay.
[155:46.31]Here we go.
[155:49.93]Puke pigs.
[155:54.12]How do these guys bleed?
[155:55.38]40%?
[155:55.40]10%?
[155:55.42]I'm taking my chances.
[156:04.97]Hey, what did he do that for?
[156:10.27]Reign of sorrows.
[156:11.89]How do you resist that?
[156:18.45]Just kill the puke pigs.
[156:20.41]Get rid of them.
[156:30.08]There we go.
[156:36.59]Stop skipping the things.
[156:38.35]What things?
[156:38.81]What are you talking about?
[156:40.49]I kind of have to heal him, don't I?
[156:41.55]Because otherwise he's going to die.
[156:46.35]Alright.
[156:53.07]These puke pigs got to go.
[156:56.63]Incoming rip?
[156:58.03]No, I wouldn't say yet.
[156:59.13]Not yet.
[156:59.45]Press disadvantage.
[157:02.37]Give them no quarter.
[157:06.56]What was he doing?
[157:08.49]What the fuck?
[157:09.65]What the hell was that?
[157:12.27]Wait, did he just do that on his own?
[157:15.55]He just did like a super heal on his own.
[157:19.57]Alright, I guess.
[157:24.13]Interesting.
[157:27.54]That was cool.
[157:28.92]That's what he used his turn on, okay.
[157:33.85]The light glows even brighter.
[157:35.91]Well, that's scared everybody.
[157:39.25]Let's just finale him.
[157:43.45]Wasn't a lot of buff on that, but it's fine.
[157:45.17]Okay, let's just keep going.
[157:59.78]cut him this game doesn't look very good uh well sorry that you feel that way I think this game is very very good so I should I I shouldn't heal this like I shouldn't stress heal him or should I because he's gonna have a heart attack right he already is in this state so get him to this state and then make sure he doesn't have a heart attack right
[158:31.72]Is that what you want to do?
[158:37.00]Don't bother stress healing?
[158:44.50]Interesting.
[158:45.09]Okay.
[158:49.13]He's not... Okay, he has to get to 200 stress.
[158:51.33]Yeah.
[158:52.21]To get to... Oh god, I have two fights here.
[158:56.55]The more stress he has, the better it is.
[159:02.78]Dull transactions.
[159:03.70]Okay, whatever.
[159:05.22]Goodbye.
[159:07.58]Can I reach him?
[159:08.84]No.
[159:10.16]Actually, that's good.
[159:13.90]Horror.
[159:18.19]Rain of sorrows.
[159:20.03]Bleed, bleed, bleed.
[159:23.05]Let's do another bleed.
[159:24.17]40%.
[159:24.27]Come on.
[159:25.15]That's a 60% chance for it to hit.
[159:27.65]Well, no.
[159:28.03]That's a 50% chance that it's gonna hit.
[159:32.79]Roll the dice.
[159:33.29]Come on.
[159:34.61]Yes.
[159:40.03]So he's just on his own.
[159:42.83]Interesting, I guess.
[159:49.94]Math?
[159:50.22]What do you mean, math?
[159:53.64]That move has an attack rating of 90.
[159:57.58]Let me explain what was going on there.
[160:00.61]My move has an attack rating of 90.
[160:02.53]So it is a percent chance that he'll just miss right?
[160:06.95]Well, does that not include That chance Explaining math again, like this guy's fucking talking about math again Gently this is how a life is taken will he die from this?
[160:28.87]No
[160:31.72]I don't understand.
[160:33.54]Long division.
[160:39.14]Bleed.

[163:05.67]I don't know.
[163:07.99]That move, I don't think I'm... This move's kind of... I don't like it.

[178:22.10]We're gonna go short, and we're gonna do a complete pitch black run.
[178:30.87]Yeah, that's what we're gonna do.
[178:39.59]Yeah, and we're gonna do it with these people, because these guys need to level up.
[178:51.68]Let's go.
[178:53.18]You think I'm fucking around?
[178:58.37]We're going full.
[178:59.47]Going fast.
[179:00.11]As fast as we can.
[179:00.75]Go.
[179:03.03]Go.
[179:04.39]Ow.
[179:08.17]Let us burn out this evil.
[179:10.57]Oh, a free torch!
[179:12.43]Now that's an emergency torch.
[179:13.53]This is an emergency torch.
[179:15.85]Awarded to the brave and the foolhardy alike.
[179:23.27]That's fine.
[179:27.40]Reduce the torch manually?
[179:30.60]Hold on, wait, you can shift cliff the torch?
[179:34.96]Oh god!
[179:36.79]Okay, alright, alright, I didn't know that.
[179:39.69]Oh my god, alright, I'm like scared.
[179:41.91]Oh shit.
[179:51.40]It's okay, we're fine.
[180:00.46]And then show them the bills.
[180:07.18]Absolute horror.
[180:10.14]I can't reach that far.
[180:14.75]I ain't fucking around.
[180:18.99]Everyone has to be at full health.
[180:26.49]Oh, come on.
[180:27.07]What?
[180:29.80]Sorry, you're dead.
[180:31.92]Goodbye.
[180:34.86]Pull your hopes.
[180:38.71]Oh, I could just heal back here.
[180:43.71]Yeah, let's just do it myself.
[180:45.61]Heal some stress.
[180:47.56]Oh, fuck, no!
[180:48.34]No, no, no!
[180:48.70]Turn the lights off!
[180:49.68]Turn the lights off!
[180:52.84]Oh, what the hell?
[180:55.20]No, you just like- somebody just came in the room and turned the light on after I was asleep and it hurt my fucking eyes.
[181:00.06]Alright, we're back to pitch black.
[181:05.97]Kept those lights off!
[181:10.59]That's pretty good.
[181:11.89]Only for a Helion though.
[181:13.85]Helion.
[181:22.62]Fuck you.
[181:25.42]Come on, go, you stressed out idiots.
[181:29.25]Alright, I'm throwing this guy in the garbage can.
[181:32.89]I want this guy to die.
[181:35.57]When we get back to town, I'm packing up a fucking knapsack with a grilled cheese sandwich in it, and this guy's going home.
[181:44.05]Wow, that's a lot of stuff.
[181:53.00]Oh, shit.
[181:55.96]It's okay.
[181:56.74]It's alright.
[181:57.42]What are these guys?
[181:57.98]These guys have a lot of blight.
[181:59.48]No bleed, but these guys don't have blight.
[182:04.24]We can't.
[182:04.60]We're gonna have to incision somebody.
[182:11.12]Stop using him to open the packs.
[182:13.34]He does it on his own.
[182:16.80]That guy does it on his own.
[182:19.18]Dammit.
[182:23.22]to spend the money.
[182:24.10]It's like $5,000.
[182:25.50]No way.
[182:28.28]$5,000 is a lot of money in this game.
[182:31.33]No, go back.
[182:31.95]Get out of here.
[182:33.03]Move to the back of the line.
[182:40.29]I'm worth it, Jerma.
[182:41.89]The guy in chat who that's named after.
[182:45.54]That's funny.
[182:46.84]Show him the bills.
[182:52.99]No, stop fucking moving me around.
[182:59.31]Just grape.
[182:59.89]No, don't grape shot it.
[183:05.45]Why am I keeping the money?
[183:06.41]Because in like a little bit, I'm gonna have to... I wanna buy something.
[183:10.94]I don't know.
[183:11.26]Don't question.
[183:12.10]Don't question my insanity.
[183:19.94]You lose that with... You lose that much with klepto.
[183:24.04]That may be.
[183:25.04]You know, that may be.
[183:29.84]Oh, fuck.
[183:30.26]I just turned off the lights.
[183:32.08]Get him off.
[183:35.10]Back to pitch black.
[183:38.58]Oh, god damn it, man.
[183:39.74]This, like, shuffle around bullshit is really annoying.
[183:42.96]So what, are they, like, bumping into each other?
[183:46.40]Is that the problem?
[183:46.98]They keep, like, whacking into each other?
[183:56.45]Have I taken an IQ test on stream?
[183:59.49]Uh, no.
[183:59.93]That would take like six hours.
[184:09.40]Let's get a heal going here.
[184:17.60]Just kill him.
[184:20.84]We already talked about this?
[184:21.86]I know.
[184:22.16]Look at all that stuff.
[184:30.34]Oh yeah, 100 bits!
[184:32.02]It actually ain't that bad.
[184:41.42]Birthday stream?
[184:43.68]Oh, I guess there's 1985 people here.
[184:49.25]God damn it, that's so annoying.
[184:50.77]Remember like the move skill thing that I was talking about?
[184:55.15]How it's like, useless?
[184:56.53]Apparently not.
[185:05.23]100 bits, you say?
[185:07.39]Yes, yes, yes.
[185:12.57]What's the bleed on these guys?
[185:14.08]It's alright.
[185:14.86]Light?
[185:15.38]Yeah, bleed.
[185:19.94]You're dead.
[185:20.92]Judge this dude.
[185:21.74]You're not quite dead.
[185:26.00]Goddammit.
[185:28.97]We're about to get some problem here.
[185:36.18]My highwayman has rabies.
[185:40.74]He does.
[185:46.96]Plus 15% damage.
[185:51.03]Good.
[185:53.29]I want rabies.
[185:56.97]That's pretty sick.
[186:00.19]Stress here with the crusader.
[186:01.33]I don't want to put the light up.
[186:03.83]I don't want the light to get higher.
[186:05.81]How many band-aids?
[186:07.65]No bandages?
[186:12.83]Yeah.
[186:16.11]What's going on here?
[186:16.81]The runs?
[186:17.85]Oh, you're talking about actually shitting your pants.
[186:22.50]Oh, God.
[186:23.28]If she touched a carcass and shit her pants.
[186:28.92]Oh, my God.
[186:30.61]You guys all suck.
[186:32.39]All these fucking guys are just idiots.
[186:34.68]All they do is take stuff.
[186:35.60]They steal things.
[186:39.44]I got a scout in pitch black.
[186:41.34]Interesting.
[186:46.86]It's alright.
[186:52.11]We're good.
[186:53.25]Poop.
[186:53.71]Ha ha ha ha.
[186:56.66]I mean, yeah.
[186:58.90]You do get so much more money, though.
[187:01.18]That's true.
[187:05.13]Dumb, doofus, and Darkest Dungeon.
[187:12.09]Is that the best move in the game?
[187:14.99]It is, isn't it?
[187:17.44]Yeah.
[187:18.00]That's what I thought.
[187:25.91]He has half of what it takes to get rid of Klepto.
[187:29.41]That's so funny.
[187:33.91]Let's get out of here with this.
[187:55.93]I almost just threw that in the trash, so I'm glad I didn't.
[188:01.04]Drop the journals?
[188:01.94]What?
[188:03.14]Why would I do that?
[188:03.76]How much health do these guys have? 10.
[188:16.56]Oh, and I put on the stupid trinket.
[188:18.56]What am I doing?
[188:21.14]Oh my god.
[188:21.92]I put on that trinket specifically and it dropped my attack rating in rank.
[188:26.45]Ayayay.
[188:29.21]It's alright.
[188:29.81]It's okay.
[188:31.65]And these guys have- and these- good thing I'm fucking lucky.
[188:41.36]Everything's fine.
[188:42.36]Everything's fine.
[188:47.80]Doge dodge.
[188:53.74]That's a... I like that move.
[188:58.30]Moves that hit multiple targets that do a lot of damage.
[189:01.00]I love it.
[189:01.68]And he has the rabies too.
[189:02.86]Yeah, that's true.
[189:03.40]How much health does he have?
[189:06.01]Nine?
[189:06.27]That's a bad idea.
[189:16.45]Okay, stop doing those moves.
[189:20.01]Do the ones that are melee moves, because you're a melee highlay man.
[189:25.01]Can't talk, apparently.
[189:29.96]And... Whack.
[189:32.04]Too bad.
[189:39.56]Finally, ma'am.
[189:42.36]1700 bucks.
[189:42.82]That's so much money.
[189:44.16]Alright.
[189:44.72]Who wants to touch the weird thing?
[189:53.25]Weak grip.
[189:55.41]Weak grip removed.
[189:57.93]Should have done it with him.
[190:00.11]But it's okay.
[190:01.37]Don't worry about it.
[190:02.14]I got weak hands.
[190:04.30]We're getting out of here.
[190:05.06]No, we're not.
[190:06.32]No, we're not.
[190:06.58]We're staying.
[190:07.00]We're staying.
[190:14.82]And a shovel two keys Try just like Marf down all this food and then use it what about the shovel it might need it though Get the fucking shovel out of here money is more important than shovels
[190:43.33]That's great.
[190:43.77]That's the worst possible combination I could have done.
[190:52.55]That's like the worst thing that could have happened.
[191:00.80]Shit.
[191:03.94]Oh god.
[191:06.50]We're okay so far.
[191:19.77]It's getting hairy.
[191:22.07]Should I turn the lights on for a second?
[191:23.39]No.
[191:24.61]Why do you have to be all the- That was the worst possible team comp it could have given me.
[191:27.81]It moved him into all the worst possible places.
[191:30.35]Thank god.
[191:37.18]That move is way too strong.
[191:46.22]What am I gonna do with this cell phone?
[191:48.08]Shotgun cases.
[191:51.88]No, we're gonna eat all the food.
[191:58.35]Okay.
[192:00.29]Go on.
[192:01.93]Shit!
[192:03.19]Oh, come on.

[192:05.41]What happened to the shovel that I had?
[192:06.45]Ah!
[192:12.05]This is bad.
[192:14.39]No, goodbye.
[192:15.59]See you later.
[192:16.37]It's not going to happen.
[192:18.09]Driving out corruption is an endless battle, but one that must be fought.
[192:23.23]That's a lot of money.
[192:28.30]Just go home.

[196:05.85]I mean, you can.
[196:08.53]You can bring somebody that's not level 3 into here, but they will, like, instantly die.
[196:14.95]You cannot bring a level, like, 5 into a level 3 dungeon.

[197:27.99]So this is the runs.
[197:29.11]Get rid of that.
[197:32.29]You also have the runs.

[200:47.75]Let's go with that.
[200:48.37]Max HP...
[200:51.59]For dodge, well, it's the frontline person so might as well who cares about the speed at this point Turbo pizza Like doctor only it's okay.
[201:02.85]I might do that God I wish I was turbo pasta Let's go Alright, good luck guys Because I don't know what any of this does So you got this is this is a death run.
[201:20.01]Oh
[201:25.78]He's okay there.
[201:26.36]This is a new move.
[201:29.79]He's okay there.
[201:30.59]The dog is okay there.
[201:34.37]Okay.
[201:35.17]Looks good.
[201:38.17]Let's go.
[201:38.47]Uh... Yeah.
[201:52.22]A special torch twice wrapped in cloth and soaked in sulfurous compounds.
[201:57.76]Wait, isn't this a short mission?
[201:59.82]Short.
[202:02.23]Hold on, this has a name.
[202:04.43]Blood for the Blood God is the name of this team.
[202:10.91]It's a sign.
[202:14.25]Okay.
[202:22.29]Eight torches.
[202:22.89]Alright, so what the fuck is... Should I bring this stuff?
[202:30.44]I don't think I want... Do I want to... I don't want to waste this stuff.
[202:32.58]What if it, like, is important?
[202:39.52]No.
[202:39.94]That's not on the first trip.
[202:41.44]I don't even know what the hell is down here.
[202:42.52]Alright, let's go.
[202:45.52]wait you don't need torches what are you talking about the torches have a gimmick despite the expectation of propriety normally ascribed to those in our position
[203:06.88]We mocked the stoic melancholy of the moss-covered fountains and cherubic statues.
[203:13.54]Our salacious trysts half-hidden in the hedgerows.
[203:16.97]Our morality slipping ever deeper.
[203:19.35]Hey, thank you, Mostly Lost, for the five bucks.
[203:22.21]PSA, remember to tag your cheers with hashtag charity, and Twitch will donate to charity for the next 13 days.
[203:28.26]Hashtag charity.
[203:30.44]That's a very, very good idea.
[203:32.82]If you're not hashtagging charity on your bits, I would start doing it.
[203:38.17]Hell yeah.
[203:39.93]Only one room?
[203:44.23]One room.
[203:45.37]Alright, I'm like scared.
[203:52.24]Blood light plus stress minus bleed resistance.
[203:55.76]So there is... I bought eight torches for this shit.
[204:01.11]I cut my finger.
[204:06.88]Oh.
[204:08.28]Whoa, alright.
[204:09.76]The thirst.
[204:13.34]What the fuck?
[204:14.86]He evolves?
[204:16.48]Every time he hits you, he evolves.
[204:17.74]Alright, let me look at this for a second.
[204:21.21]Sixteen dodge.
[204:26.15]Nine speed.
[204:26.75]Alright, let's bring that down.
[204:29.65]It's just a mosquito doctor.
[204:31.21]It really is.
[204:34.05]It's fucking mosquito doctor.
[204:38.55]Uh, this is bleed resistance.
[204:39.69]Oh, that's alright.
[204:41.36]These marks.
[204:45.00]What is this?
[204:45.34]This is just a heal over time.
[204:46.76]Alright, that's fine.
[204:53.33]How do you resist that shit?
[204:54.23]I don't know.
[204:55.43]If it bleeds.
[204:56.99]Bleed, and then this is another bleed.
[205:01.59]Brought lots of bleeds.
[205:04.21]We got plenty of... Oh, god damn it.
[205:05.99]I misclicked.
[205:07.45]What a fucking blunder.
[205:08.97]What a failure.
[205:10.85]I misclicked.
[205:12.81]Aye, aye, aye.
[205:14.05]There should be a confirmation when you click in this game.
[205:18.83]I can't be making those kind of mistakes in the Crimson Courtyard.
[205:24.29]Whoa.
[205:27.56]Whoa.
[205:32.70]Holy shit.
[205:33.38]Okay, hold on.
[205:36.17]Minus 20% stress.
[205:39.59]Uh, sure.
[205:41.01]Put that on.
[205:42.99]Deep... I don't want that on.
[205:45.20]Okay, cool.
[205:48.14]Nice.
[205:48.90]Hold up.
[205:54.10]More aliens.
[205:55.56]The mosquito things are freaking me out.
[206:00.37]Pretty nice book.
[206:05.69]Hmm... This guy does not have... Is he in like the wrong spot?
[206:11.61]I don't like this guy's moves.
[206:12.43]His moves are all fucked up.
[206:17.51]This heal sucks.
[206:21.34]One point for two rounds.
[206:22.58]That heals two points and I take nine damage.
[206:27.94]Doesn't that seem like... I don't... I feel like that's not good.
[206:38.48]Whatever.
[206:42.73]The other guy was better.
[206:45.55]It's better when he's almost dead?
[206:46.71]Okay, well, let's see here.
[206:47.85]This is... Only hits one guy.
[206:51.03]Three points for three rounds, and I debuff myself.
[206:53.91]This is two points for three... I mean, it's... Whatever.
[206:56.14]Ah.
[206:58.28]Got back here.
[207:01.20]Sorry, I gotta... He has to be in the front, then.
[207:10.25]pre-digestion.
[207:12.27]That's gross.
[207:14.69]Hey, thank you, Bailey Nothing, for the 30 bucks.
[207:21.75]Charity, hashtag charity, hashtag charity, hashtag charity.
[207:25.76]Well, thank you so much for the 30 fucking dollars.
[207:28.52]You gave 15 dollars twice.
[207:30.74]Thanks a lot.
[207:31.62]Appreciate it.
[207:33.72]You literally sent them on a suicide mission.
[207:35.54]You're complaining that they're weak.
[207:37.90]See, that's how they're gonna win, though.
[207:39.56]They know that they're not good enough.
[207:42.50]And they're gonna prove themselves right now.
[207:43.88]And they're gonna end up being the most powerful of all my people.
[207:46.56]Right?
[207:50.56]Anybody got dodge?
[207:51.76]No.
[207:54.12]Uh... Just gonna do that.
[208:01.22]Hmm...
[208:08.17]He's not going to die from that bleed.
[208:11.01]He might eventually, but not.
[208:12.43]I'm just going to whack somebody.
[208:25.58]They'll die knowing they were sad and weak.
[208:30.79]Strong dog.
[208:31.71]I like the Howlmaster.
[208:32.69]Howlmaster's cool.
[208:34.51]He'd be very effective.
[208:41.89]So now this is, you get the debuff.
[208:43.87]So now the bleed resistance is at zero.
[208:49.35]Forgot that they have a guard too.
[208:50.64]What is this thing?
[209:10.87]The hive is twisted and unnatural.
[209:13.77]You hope this will do the... Can I not grab it?
[209:17.97]Oh, wait.
[209:18.31]I have to burn this.
[209:24.27]Oh, alright.
[209:24.77]Okay, you burn the hives.
[209:27.01]I get it.
[209:31.37]So I really didn't need to bring any torches at all.
[209:36.00]thank you squeaking hiccups for the four dollars for the kids hashtag for the kids hashtag charity oh thank you so much also thank you again to juge rotter the five dollars uh cragasm 100 cragasm 100 five times uh bubbo's phlegm blood and guts
[210:01.63]Boils, boogies, rod and puss.
[210:04.99]Listen, I ain't reading that.
[210:06.23]You're gonna, like, summon a fucking demon in my house.
[210:10.74]Like, I'm not gonna read some witch's brew shit.
[210:12.68]You know what I mean?
[210:13.52]No.
[210:14.58]Thank you for the five dollars, though.
[210:23.76]I'm gonna finish that and all of a sudden I'm gonna get fucking attacked.
[210:27.66]I really need to swap these two.
[210:29.10]He's more effective in the front.
[210:32.37]Robbing cocoons.
[210:36.96]And would you look at that?
[210:38.76]Would you look at that?
[210:40.28]There was a reason to bring torches.
[210:41.76]You burn these things.
[210:43.54]Right?
[210:46.70]Exactly.
[210:47.16]There's a fight here.
[210:57.89]No traps.
[210:59.77]There is a fight.
[211:02.66]Couple of mosquitoes.
[211:04.20]No big deal.
[211:09.98]Snakes manifesting.
[211:11.15]There's snakes everywhere.
[211:19.91]So where do I need to be for this to work?
[211:22.89]I gotta be... Okay.
[211:23.97]I just have to be below a certain amount of damage.
[211:26.82]I gotta take damage.
[211:29.14]Oh well.
[211:32.10]Any interest in playing the Mario and Rabbids game?
[211:34.84]Probably not.
[211:39.39]Uh, yeah.
[211:40.19]I mean, I don't have a Switch, so... Maybe if I had a Switch.
[211:56.64]$6,673 raised so far for extra life.
[212:01.08]13 more days to show support.
[212:03.34]That's cool.
[212:04.58]$6,700 so far.
[212:06.04]Nice.
[212:09.62]Donate so I can buy a Switch?
[212:10.98]No, you don't have to... I... I was gonna wait till the new Mario game comes out and then pretend like I was gonna stream it.
[212:17.03]You know what I mean?
[212:18.91]I was gonna be like, Mario!
[212:20.31]Odyssey!
[212:21.47]You can, like, steal cars and shit!
[212:24.05]Fuck, I don't have a shovel.
[212:26.29]Without tools of iron, you must rely on flesh.
[212:29.99]An indefatigable purpose.
[212:32.01]Super Mario Odyssey is like a GTA, right?
[212:33.83]It's like you take place in the real world, and you're in like New York City or something, and you're Mario.
[212:38.81]That's what it is, right?
[212:44.77]Maybe I should watch the trailer.
[212:46.24]I'm almost at the end.
[212:47.94]Why was this so hard?
[212:50.82]Everybody was like, holy shit, Jeremy, get away from there.
[212:52.78]It's too hard.
[212:53.38]These are like random level zeros.
[212:55.06]This is this hard?
[213:00.24]Speaking of zero.
[213:00.88]Let's try to get the gun back.
[213:09.32]I'm almost at the end?
[213:14.91]What are you talking about?
[213:19.07]This is so easy.
[213:20.63]Darkest Dungeon is not even a difficult video game.
[213:28.17]He said, blood for the blood god.
[213:29.73]Yeah.
[213:33.25]You don't think these random Twitch viewers are gonna be able to, like, look.
[213:36.40]You honestly think that Carnival Etalyx is gonna, this is, you know how, this is a streamer, guys.
[213:43.72]You know how powerful he is?
[213:45.06]He's a fucking twitch.tv streamer.
[213:58.31]whatever whatever what the fuck I'm just ah what the fuck torches for the torch throwing see
[214:21.06]I want her... I could have done it to him and I need to remember these things.
[214:24.02]Stop just panicking.
[214:24.98]I'm not even panicking.
[214:25.72]I'm just rushing.
[214:27.28]Oh, that's a lot of ways to go.
[214:28.46]Let's go up first.
[214:36.94]Ow, my finger.
[214:41.69]These bones held riches.
[214:43.79]Yes, they did.
[214:47.97]Alright, I gotta get rid of the clown butler.
[214:50.11]The clown bird butler needs to die first.
[214:55.93]Stop rushing?
[214:56.65]I can't help it.
[214:57.71]I'm a rusher, dude.
[214:58.55]That's what I did in Call of Duty.
[214:59.67]You guys remember my COD days?
[215:02.45]I'm a fucking rusher.
[215:03.33]And I was on the team.
[215:12.20]I was on the rush team.
[215:14.68]Actually, I have five points.
[215:19.90]Oh, so by the way, is the new Call of Duty a piece of shit?
[215:24.78]Is that what I understand?
[215:26.12]The Crimson Curse.
[215:28.58]One of your heroes has the Crimson Curse.
[215:31.36]The curse is not like other diseases.
[215:33.15]It can't be cured normally in the sanitarium.
[215:36.47]The only way to keep it at bay is with the blood.
[215:38.73]There may be other ways to cure it.
[215:45.39]Madness in my veins.
[215:50.75]Does the dog have it, or do I have it?
[215:54.69]What's up?
[215:56.79]Oh, that's not good.
[215:57.81]Minus 5% all everything.
[216:00.31]Minus 10% max HP in one speed.
[216:03.31]Huh.
[216:03.69]Okay.
[216:04.13]Well, that sucks, but it's not terrible, I guess.
[216:09.20]Let's hug my dog.
[216:11.06]We're both diseased.
[216:12.68]Give me a hug.
[216:20.61]Hmm this guy can't even do shit might as well just do this that guy's no dodge anyways Zero dodge he already was to begin with Well, whoever was infected just got the other one too now wait I can the crimson curse can be spread Oh another one of these things
[216:51.39]Bingo.
[216:53.74]I'm only going to do one more.
[217:02.20]It was a joke.
[217:03.08]Alright, what is this?
[217:07.56]Damned fountain.
[217:09.46]I don't have anything to cure this with, so just grab it.
[217:16.76]Can't catch a break with that guy.
[217:17.98]Alright, go down.
[217:24.54]Pretty uncommon.
[217:26.18]That's cool.
[217:26.98]That's a good thing.
[217:32.14]Activate three hives.
[217:34.34]Only one more.
[217:37.69]Holy water solves all problems, I can imagine.
[217:44.17]And there was nothing in this entire hallway.
[217:50.87]Nothing in here either.
[217:55.57]Might as well just exhaust all the options.
[218:04.23]Oh, great.
[218:05.21]Not only is he gonna have the Crimson Curse, he's also gonna go fucking insane.
[218:10.12]Who is this?
[218:10.50]Alright, Caesar Salad.
[218:14.34]This was a suicide mission.
[218:23.55]Oh, thank god he dodged it.
[218:25.92]No one's gonna die.
[218:27.00]No one has died in almost three and a half hours, guys.
[218:31.34]You didn't have any faith in me at all.
[218:33.68]You thought that I was gonna just lose.
[218:36.14]And like everybody was gonna die, I was gonna mess up everything.
[218:38.58]No one's died.
[218:39.36]Not one person's died and not one person will die.
[218:42.32]Except for this guy.
[218:48.37]What the fuck?
[218:51.87]They're not all gonna get it, are they?
[219:02.67]I don't like all their moves are bad.
[219:06.64]How much health do you have, 10?
[219:07.38]Fucking bloodsucker.
[219:16.87]Bleed out from that.
[219:21.49]Bleed out from that.
[219:23.97]Blood.
[219:27.97]Very common to get that in here.
[219:29.79]I assume it isn't.
[219:30.77]We're about to see him go nuts.
[219:32.31]He's going to lose his mind.
[219:36.62]And any second now.
[219:40.04]There we go.
[219:41.20]What's your problem?
[219:42.02]Here it comes.
[219:44.00]Nope, not quite.
[219:52.38]And just get killed.
[219:58.17]Why am I playing a discount Pokémon game?
[220:00.37]What are you talking about?
[220:06.99]One of these guys is getting guarded.
[220:09.13]Please die.
[220:11.73]I need AoE.
[220:12.77]None of you guys have any fucking AoE.
[220:15.89]You should have it.
[220:16.71]And you should have it too.
[220:18.14]And you should also have it.
[220:20.34]And so should he.
[220:22.70]Where's the AoE?
[220:27.63]I brought everybody with a bunch of bleeds.
[220:29.07]It doesn't even matter.
[220:34.85]Just hurt him.
[220:37.76]No one is targeting him.
[220:39.26]He needs to get stressed out so that he can lose his mind and start swinging at people.
[220:47.11]Do it.
[220:51.39]I need to change the move sets.
[220:52.51]Yeah, but this was literally just four level zeros.
[220:56.57]Except for Etalyx.
[220:58.49]Whatever.
[221:00.57]He's gone soon anyways.
[221:08.00]Nice.
[221:14.38]Finally.
[221:15.62]All these guys have such low damage bleed moves.
[221:19.10]This was a mistake.
[221:22.73]You know, I'm gonna just give myself a bunch of damage.
[221:24.47]And just whack the next person.
[221:35.52]Mm-hmm.
[221:37.34]Okay.
[221:37.88]What do these guys have for speed?
[221:40.60]10 speed, that's why.
[221:41.74]This guy has 10 fucking speed.
[221:46.36]No wonder he's been going- Oh, okay.
[221:49.07]Almost dead.
[221:50.91]There we go.
[221:52.72]Selfish.
[221:59.48]Well, this guy's going to the trash can when we get home.
[222:01.88]Alright, hold on a minute, hold on.
[222:05.92]This is a super damage move, and it heals me.
[222:10.52]No, I want to keep him where he is.
[222:12.82]No, keep him where he is.
[222:13.78]I'm going to need it later.
[222:16.22]Save the dog.
[222:23.27]Okay, we're good.
[222:27.59]Just die.
[222:29.03]This fight is taking so long.
[222:31.63]Alright, good.
[222:32.91]That's fine.
[222:33.59]You can do that if you want.
[222:40.71]Okay.
[222:41.89]So that was not the right way.
[222:43.55]Obviously.
[222:47.52]Let's not use the good move.
[222:48.56]No, because I want to keep him at like 50%.
[222:49.68]I'm not going to use that move on one mosquito.
[222:54.49]Really?
[222:54.89]No way.
[222:56.75]I'm not going to use that move on one fucking mosquito.
[222:59.18]I'm going to make sure he's at 50% health for the next fight.
[223:02.50]And really give it my all.
[223:12.48]Alright, watch it.
[223:13.30]Here we go.
[223:15.16]Alright, this is probably the last room, I assume.
[223:17.12]It's not.
[223:23.33]It's not.
[223:29.08]Come on.
[223:29.86]Come on, this awful team cough.
[223:32.08]Make it happen.
[223:42.34]Come on, Etalyx.
[223:43.06]What the hell was that?
[223:51.36]Who has the most health here?
[223:53.72]He does.
[223:56.36]I could just, I could smash him right now and just, he'll die in, uh, in like two or three turns.
[224:03.30]Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
[224:06.16]Fuck, I can't do it.
[224:06.96]I can't.
[224:07.42]Come on!
[224:10.68]Fine, I'll do it to the Dr. Mosquito guy in front.
[224:12.55]I just wanna see what it is.
[224:13.41]Alright, that's cool.
[224:15.27]Let's try this.
[224:24.13]Try this on for size.
[224:32.52]Focus the mosquito, quick!
[224:35.30]Well, the mosquito's gonna die.
[224:42.04]Stop stressing everybody out with your nonsense.
[224:50.23]Ow.
[224:56.19]Oh, great.
[224:57.94]Well, now he's in deep trouble.
[225:00.09]It's time for self-preservation here at Talos.
[225:09.99]Do it!
[225:10.75]Good, finally!
[225:12.29]Now he can lose his mind and he can turn into the raptures guy that I want.
[225:18.20]Good.
[225:21.70]She's just running away.
[225:22.46]Alright, just take care of yourself.
[225:26.70]You're doing great.
[225:31.97]Save the dog.
[225:32.53]I'm trying to.
[225:35.85]I gotta move, like, forward.
[225:37.19]God damn it.
[225:39.33]He's really messing this whole thing up.
[225:50.58]Come on!
[225:51.28]Give me something better than that.
[225:53.36]He's just been back there the whole time.
[225:56.73]Let's make somebody a fucking crush here.
[226:11.36]Nobody has any moves.
[226:14.00]Everybody's moves suck.
[226:18.67]I got so obsessed with this guy's bleed health.
[226:22.02]His reduction to bleed chance on everybody.
[226:24.72]I took a bunch of bleeds and I didn't take any real moves.
[226:34.70]Now he's dead.
[226:37.10]No, he's not.
[226:37.76]Who is he guarding?
[226:38.86]What the fuck?
[226:44.24]The body's limit heart attack.
[226:45.81]I know.
[226:46.11]I know, I know, I know.
[226:47.27]I know what a heart attack is.
[226:48.35]This guy's so dead.
[227:00.90]He's so dead.
[227:01.62]No.
[227:03.68]I have...
[227:14.86]Whoa!
[227:15.40]What are you doing?
[227:17.97]Hey!
[227:19.29]What?
[227:21.15]What was that for?
[227:23.11]No!
[227:23.41]I didn't want to do that!
[227:24.09]He doesn't have any bleed on him.
[227:30.77]Just don't hit the dog.
[227:34.21]You gotta move forward.
[227:35.33]Get over there.
[227:36.91]Alright.
[227:37.35]Everybody calm down.
[227:37.97]We're fine.
[227:40.24]Everything's fine.
[227:40.96]We're gonna eat some snacks.
[227:42.22]We're okay.
[227:46.12]We're just gonna have a snack.
[227:49.18]Get back to normal.
[227:55.36]Here it is.
[227:55.90]We're gonna get it right here.
[227:59.44]The party's falling apart.
[228:00.65]It's okay.
[228:02.37]We're gonna get there and... No traps.
[228:05.81]No traps.
[228:10.67]Craving the blood.
[228:11.48]One of your infected heroes has a thirst which can only be satisfied with the blood.
[228:14.72]Feed them sooner.
[228:15.42]They may begin to weaken.
[228:16.46]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[228:20.22]My life is fucking horrible.
[228:22.60]I hate everything.
[228:23.90]I just smashed a vase.
[228:33.19]What?
[228:38.56]This is short?
[228:40.37]You gotta be kidding me.
[228:43.71]I don't have any blood.
[228:44.55]It didn't take any with me.
[228:45.33]What the fuck is this guy?
[228:46.35]What is this?
[228:47.93]You're like the shithead of the group.
[228:49.63]You touch it.
[229:01.04]It's alright.
[229:01.72]He's just having a lot of problems.
[229:04.83]Oh boy, this is bad.
[229:09.10]No traps.
[229:11.56]You're just the Guinea pig for every situation.
[229:14.94]I don't have any blood.
[229:17.22]Alright, there's a fight, there's a fight, there's a fight.
[229:21.34]It's a crocodile.
[229:23.32]What the fuck is that thing?
[229:24.98]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[229:26.42]This thing has 110 health?
[229:28.59]Oh, God.
[229:34.87]What the fuck?
[229:36.25]Everything has 100 HP?
[229:47.52]He's sneaking down.
[229:49.40]Okay, I don't know what this mechanic is.
[229:52.14]He's got all resistances.
[229:53.75]He's got 20%... I can't hit him.
[229:59.77]Do I hit the grass?
[230:01.19]I don't understand this mechanic.
[230:02.27]He's getting closer.
[230:04.57]Just do some buffs.
[230:06.85]He's gonna, like, show up here.
[230:08.64]Swarming corruption.
[230:10.26]Woo!
[230:16.48]Hopeless!
[230:17.88]Oh, God.
[230:20.26]Oh, God.
[230:22.15]Oh, God.
[230:23.75]Hey!
[230:25.49]What are you... Teeth break.
[230:29.81]Oh, goodness gracious.
[230:31.01]This is what happened.
[230:31.93]This is why you guys were telling me this is not gonna be easy.
[230:35.79]I can't even... This guy has 50% bleed resistance.
[230:41.23]Don't resist it.
[230:42.11]Oh, God.
[230:47.43]Please, just a taste.
[230:51.55]You're already injured.
[230:54.32]He just ate himself.
[230:56.08]I can smell the blood.
[230:56.96]This is like the shittiest fucking... Alright, now we know what's in here.
[231:06.06]Your last hurrah.
[231:08.51]Two damage.
[231:10.09]These things... Oh, my lord.
[231:11.95]He won't even do it.
[231:18.45]There's no fighting him.
[231:19.27]We shall not survive.
[231:20.35]Okay.
[231:21.71]So, do it to the dog.
[231:25.40]No, we don't run.
[231:26.84]Captain goes down with the ship, guys.
[231:28.74]Except for Etalyx.
[231:29.70]No, wait.
[231:30.12]This is Etalyx.
[231:42.34]No!
[231:44.00]I didn't mean to do that!
[231:44.78]I didn't mean to do that!
[231:46.24]I didn't mean to do that!
[231:47.02]Where's he going?
[231:57.27]Heart attack incoming.
[231:59.89]Okay, there's definitely like a...
[232:05.53]He's right here.
[232:05.95]He's right here.
[232:06.39]He's right here.
[232:06.83]He's right here.
[232:07.29]He's right here.
[232:07.79]Get out.
[232:08.07]Get out.
[232:08.33]Get out.
[232:09.05]Get out!
[232:11.07]Get out!
[232:11.97]Do not pull me from the fight.
[232:13.30]What?!
[232:19.30]Okay, we're fine.
[232:24.48]This guy's still alive.
[232:27.53]He's still alive.
[232:28.09]He had a heart attack and he's still alive.
[232:31.77]Okay, well, good job, guys.
[232:35.47]Oh, I'm so close!
[232:36.63]It's alright, I left with like five grid and air loops.
[232:58.72]I mean, at this point, at this point, I mean, come on, all these guys, I don't want to cure all these guys.
[233:08.29]You made that choice?
[233:08.97]I don't know if there was going to be a boss in there.
[233:10.59]Why does this keep fucking happening?
[233:12.07]How do I get rid of this?
[233:16.14]This has been the town event for like four weeks in a row.
[233:21.00]How do I get the fuck, how do I get rid of this?
[233:26.00]Is this going to be that every single time until I do the first mission in the courtyard?
[233:29.13]Okay.
[233:35.21]These guys are going to go take a drink.
[233:40.45]I have to beat the crocodile to do that.
[233:43.69]Wow.
[233:44.13]Okay.
[233:44.43]I have to beat that quest.
[233:50.01]Alright.
[233:50.27]Stress level.
[233:50.79]How are we doing?
[233:51.44]Oh, you guys are doing great.
[233:53.63]Alright, well.
[233:59.47]Do I want to waste slots on you guys, or should I just tell you to go home?
[234:02.63]Where else does this guy go?
[234:05.33]He's got rabies.
[234:05.92]That's fine.
[234:06.86]I'm okay with that.
[234:12.02]Alright.
[234:12.58]Go get whipped for a little while.
[234:15.44]No, this is a waste of money.
[234:20.66]Get out of here.
[234:23.16]Did I just lose?
[234:26.37]Okay, no.
[234:29.95]Like, that's not worth it.
[234:35.41]Give me my book back.
[234:41.28]Get out of here.
[234:41.88]I mean, I could...
[235:01.29]Come on.
[235:02.19]He survived that whole thing.
[235:07.16]Come on!
[235:12.20]Etalyx the Unscared.
[235:13.60]There you go.
[235:15.46]I'm not wasting like $7,000 on people right now.
[235:17.20]What?
[235:32.70]I don't want him spreading that shit to everybody.
[235:34.12]See ya.
[235:42.87]Alright, well, that was a good mission to determine what was going on in that dungeon.
[236:05.58]Can we do any upgrades?
[236:12.73]I could.
[236:13.07]I think I could do an exchange here.
[236:15.33]Let's see.
[236:18.21]Three of these equals one page.
[236:24.77]Is that worth it for me?
[236:25.61]No.
[236:26.09]I'm going to do that like fucking 20 times.
[236:27.57]It's not worth it.
[236:33.73]I remain.
[236:34.49]That's true.
[236:37.99]Alright, let's do... I need more of these.
[236:47.02]Literally had a 5% chance to spread that.
[236:49.30]Well, whatever.
[237:01.76]Bring you here.
[237:05.71]Obsessed with Fugu to only meditate.
[237:07.39]Probably just get rid of that.
[237:12.81]I should have looked at that first.
[237:13.81]Fuck.
[237:19.83]Oh, whatever.
[237:20.44]You have any other problems I can work with?
[237:28.68]That's way worse.
[237:31.70]Yeah, this one's worse.
[237:36.00]Back to the pit.
[237:38.39]That is true.
[237:41.15]So what do we got?
[237:41.87]We got bird Jerma, real Jerma.
[237:45.95]They both can't be in the same team because then it would be a paradox.
[237:53.28]Who's in here?
[237:56.74]Okay.
[237:59.80]We have plenty of tanks.
[238:02.89]I have like mostly tanks.
[238:05.46]One, two, three, four.
[238:07.40]I have like half my entire squad.
[238:09.37]Half everybody I have is a tank.
[238:13.47]I need some more like damage dealers.
[238:21.53]Okay, full leper.
[238:22.35]You want to do triple leper?
[238:25.88]Are we doing another joke run?
[238:31.85]No, you can't do triple leper.
[238:33.39]You have to do double leper.
[238:34.87]Because they won't be able to hit anything.
[238:35.93]I'll do double leper.
[238:37.65]I'll give it a try.
[238:44.10]Yeah.
[238:46.52]Double leper.
[238:47.02]I'm going to give this guy a name.
[238:47.96]Who is he going to be?
[238:53.42]Play a shitty game for jokes?
[238:55.53]We've been doing a lot of that lately.
[239:02.17]Well, this is not a Crusader, so he can't beat Dens.
[239:08.29]Double Leper is your go-to.
[239:09.77]I feel like it'd be good.
[239:11.43]I'm going to go in and change the moves, though.
[239:13.15]Okay, we got Dan with Wings.
[239:18.57]There you go.
[239:21.08]There's your other Leper.
[239:22.94]What does this Leper have?
[239:24.98]This guy has the damage buff and the mark.
[239:29.81]I think I'm going to give this other one the self heal and the self... and the stress heal.
[239:38.10]Or the corpse clear.
[239:43.44]This guy has the corpse clear.
[239:45.56]So I'm going to give... Actually, you know what?
[239:46.80]That's fine.
[239:48.00]I am going to take this off for him and give him the stress heal.
[239:56.57]No, fuck that.
[239:57.05]I'm going to do the self heal.
[240:01.07]Yeah, let's just go unlock the self-heal.
[240:10.42]And here it is.
[240:16.24]Vin Diesel, the heal man.
[240:22.42]There's the buff and that, and there is the self-heal.
[240:28.80]Alright, we got that.
[240:30.94]You are... This guy's leveled up, so I gotta be careful.
[240:34.29]What about trinkets?
[240:35.85]Minus 20s.
[240:36.51]Minus 20s.
[240:38.81]Cultist only.
[240:42.27]Well, let's give it to him.
[240:42.95]Maybe we'll be stressed out, you know?
[240:47.79]Okay, what do we want?
[240:48.51]I need a support.
[240:49.99]I think I only have one support that's not being healed right now.
[240:54.71]Yeah, this guy.
[240:57.18]You can go ahead and come along.
[241:01.14]And damage.
[241:04.20]I think Bird Jerma.
[241:07.25]Bird Jerma.
[241:08.95]Yeah.
[241:09.79]It's going to be Bird Jerma.
[241:10.57]Because Bird Jerma can attack the back line.
[241:18.34]So can he.
[241:18.80]I'm going to go buy him that move.
[241:21.64]I like the artillery move.
[241:28.58]Jeremiah hi.
[241:29.80]Yeah.
[241:29.98]Yeah, I can't do that.
[241:31.42]Yeah I Want that's cool.
[241:41.13]That's the stun More damage, um, I Like this back line thing, but how do I replace it with this is good, too.
[241:52.84]Oh
[241:54.07]The stun?
[241:55.33]I have a stun.
[241:57.13]That'll be fine.
[241:58.19]I'll do that one.
[242:00.71]I like going to the back line.
[242:07.94]And the stab is good just to have.
[242:09.30]Okay.
[242:11.74]We're fine here.
[242:13.20]Bird Jerm is upgraded.
[242:14.20]He is upgraded.
[242:16.28]Okay.
[242:20.34]Let's go.
[242:24.20]I do like having people in the back line, especially if it's a plague doctor.
[242:27.15]I'm going to put him all the way in the back.
[242:34.11]Alright.
[242:34.89]Which one am I going to do?
[242:38.58]I have a pretty balanced short or they're all short.
[242:49.69]Let's go to the Warrens.
[242:54.78]No, let's go to the runes.
[242:55.46]Because this will level up to two.
[242:57.62]And then there should be a boss after this.
[243:05.19]Take this.
[243:06.65]There we go.
[243:09.22]Okay.
[243:12.02]Take a look at my cultist only.
[243:14.98]Can I have two of these?
[243:15.76]I can only have one at the same time.
[243:19.57]Plague Doctor, that's fine.
[243:20.81]I like that.
[243:22.05]It's only one less HP, so it doesn't matter, but you get much more percent chance to hit.
[243:29.50]Do the one at the top right.
[243:31.14]No, I'm not doing the Darkest Dungeon.
[243:35.29]That sure looks like fun.
[243:37.13]Now, we're going to do this, and we're going to try to kill the boss that's in here, too.
[243:39.55]Let's move.
[243:45.71]let's go it's like six torches and ten food a key and I'm not doing the Darkest Dungeon that's instant death for everybody everybody will die
[244:12.59]We gotta kill one boss before I turn the stream off, for sure.
[244:18.76]I do like double leper strategy, though.
[244:26.32]It's the name of the game.
[244:29.07]This ain't a suicide mission.
[244:29.97]This is a pretty good team.
[244:35.59]Please tell me I don't have to go down.
[244:36.55]I didn't go far enough.
[244:38.01]Fuck.
[244:38.59]It's okay.
[244:38.93]Whatever.
[244:41.81]yep yep yep yep yep yep that was nine damage you gotta be kidding me big guy that's fine I can deal with this this is actually this is like perfect comp for this team like this is a perfect comp look at this hit them I can go I can go way behind this big fat guy
[245:13.76]And we're gonna go... So he doesn't have any protection.
[245:19.71]He has high damage though, doesn't he?
[245:24.87]I could just fuck him up.
[245:25.73]I could just whack him.
[245:26.95]Just whack him.
[245:31.90]Almost.
[245:32.32]We have the power of God and anime on our side.
[245:43.80]Good, that doesn't matter.
[245:45.12]That doesn't fuck up my formation at all.
[245:52.37]Damn it!
[245:52.85]It's okay.
[245:53.45]Light him.
[245:53.93]Good.
[245:54.25]He's dead.
[245:55.11]Can this guy get a turn, please?
[245:59.76]Give this guy a turn.
[246:01.62]I need to give this guy a turn so he can heal.
[246:03.00]I'm not... This is too early for this.
[246:04.56]There we go.
[246:12.95]Fucking perfect team comp.
[246:15.85]Perfect.
[246:19.19]An altar dedicated to unholy abominations.
[246:21.28]Oh, unholy you say, huh?
[246:25.44]Fear of Eldritch removed.
[246:28.08]Nice.
[246:32.98]This is the new meta.
[246:34.48]Take this to the Darkest Dungeon subreddit.
[246:36.90]Be like, guys, this streamer was in the level 1 short dungeon.
[246:41.81]And he found arguably the best thing ever.
[246:45.39]Alchemy table?
[246:46.73]Should I put herbs in here?
[246:54.43]Very cool.
[247:03.21]What a genius.
[247:07.71]What a total genius.
[247:08.99]I don't know if I need to go down or not.
[247:11.98]I'd like to avoid... potentially too much... Fuck it, let's just go down.
[247:19.80]Whatever.
[247:21.20]Quadruple Jester Strat was discovered years ago.
[247:25.88]Uh... Well, I only have one Jester.
[247:28.74]There's only been one Jester in the town.
[247:42.23]I want it on that guy.
[247:43.17]You're a fucking smart boy!
[247:53.96]People have had this game figured out for over a decade.
[247:56.70]I'm sure they have.
[247:58.84]Fuck.
[248:01.48]I could have been deaf right there.
[248:07.19]Actually, what even is the meta for this game?
[248:09.69]It is something ridiculous.
[248:10.65]I can imagine something crazy.
[248:12.99]Something so specific and awkward.
[248:15.67]Alright, he's dead.
[248:18.67]Stun him.
[248:25.54]That's an 11.
[248:31.72]I can't reach him.
[248:34.18]So, I'm going to clear the body.
[248:42.27]Fuck.
[248:46.05]Four antiquarians.
[248:47.85]I haven't seen one antiquarian the entire game.
[248:57.37]Don't you want to have early game like one or two antiquarians in your party just to get a ton of money?
[249:02.14]I haven't seen one.
[249:03.42]That's kind of good.
[249:17.27]Locked cabinet.
[249:25.91]Alright.
[249:26.67]Cool.
[249:27.73]An urn holds ashes.
[249:29.07]Decorative urn.
[249:29.66]It's sentimental gifts are inside.
[249:33.44]How could there be more inside of a fucking person's ashes than inside of a locked chest?
[249:41.28]The abomination is... We haven't seen one abomination either.
[249:46.99]There's like two or three classes we haven't even seen yet.
[249:49.31]And look at fucking a perfect chest for that.
[249:50.69]God damn it.
[249:52.27]That's annoying.
[249:53.29]Oh well.
[249:57.57]That's very annoying.
[250:04.39]Double abomination, double flagellant.
[250:08.17]I can see that.
[250:12.86]The problem with the Abomination, when I was playing before, was he can't use him in a lot of comps, because all the religious people refuse to be in a party with him.
[250:23.75]So it's difficult to try to put him in the right spot, because he can't be with other people.
[250:35.52]So yeah, you couldn't even do that, because isn't the Flagellant religious?
[250:42.98]That's annoying.
[250:46.20]Come on.
[250:49.71]Yes.
[250:51.53]Fucking two plague doctors, two lepers.
[250:55.43]Game over.
[250:55.95]That's how you win the game.
[250:58.85]He's double stacked, so just stab him.
[251:01.02]Can you reach?
[251:01.48]No, you can't even reach.
[251:12.56]Now, can you imagine if that was 16 damage stacked up?
[251:15.76]That'd be awesome.
[251:16.30]And I don't have any more keys.
[251:19.58]And, of course, it's trapped.
[251:21.25]Why would it not be trapped?
[251:23.67]You know?
[251:24.61]Why would it not be trapped?
[251:25.61]This is Darkest Dungeon.
[251:26.25]It throws up a Gears of War logo every time somebody dies.
[251:28.93]What?
[251:44.86]Do I have any bandages?
[251:45.54]No.
[251:49.54]Ow.
[251:56.18]The unwavering corruption.
[251:57.64]I have a shovel, right?
[251:59.69]Yeah, I did.
[252:00.15]Good.
[252:01.67]Good.
[252:01.83]At least I was not dumb enough to not bring one.
[252:03.61]Still bleeding, apparently.
[252:10.99]Shovel!
[252:14.00]There it is.
[252:19.96]And... Nothing.
[252:26.59]Well, at least it... I don't like getting those rolls where you get a battle in the middle.
[252:33.75]Like, I have a battle now and I got a battle later.
[252:35.55]It's too many battles.
[252:40.39]And I wish I had two Plague Doctors.
[252:42.23]Just to rain hell on the backlines.
[252:53.54]Should be able to deal with two swings.
[252:57.04]Look at that.
[252:58.34]Now that's a comp I can deal with.
[252:59.70]That's a comp I'm fucking looking forward to playing with.
[253:01.74]You know what I mean?
[253:08.33]found that shovel don't matter two bird germans and two like chat members really nice hmm
[253:35.12]Don't focus on him anymore.
[253:36.24]Just attack the guy.
[253:37.02]Oh, he's already dead.
[253:37.80]Never mind.
[253:39.78]Should be able to reach over.
[253:42.26]Oh.
[253:44.72]That's not cool.
[253:46.62]Neither was that.
[253:49.30]Ah.
[253:49.90]Well, it's all up to the bird.
[253:52.56]He's not gonna die.
[253:58.05]Yeah, he is.
[254:00.99]The leper sucks.
[254:05.04]I have one more.
[254:13.58]Porch.
[254:14.36]Unyielding.
[254:17.33]Deathblow resistance.
[254:18.29]That's good.
[254:22.21]You open this one.
[254:24.75]It's a map.
[254:25.23]I guess it determines if this is worth going down to or not.
[254:29.46]It's not worth going down to.
[254:30.64]Just end this.
[254:31.46]Eat all the food and leave.
[254:37.42]Let's go.
[254:41.92]Why would I put lepers in a party with an occultist?
[254:44.54]Because the occultist is the only healer that I currently had that was not... Like, in town somewhere.
[254:53.55]And there was nobody available on the cart.
[254:56.67]There's your explanation.
[255:01.02]And you know what?
[255:01.52]Maybe because I just fucking feel like it.
[255:02.92]Hmm?
[255:06.20]It's the Darkest Dungeon, man.
[255:07.06]We don't need any answers.
[255:10.24]We can't even do anything.
[255:22.09]Oh, no.
[255:22.47]Not the Wolverine.
[255:23.13]Isn't the... The Abomination was made by a Kickstarter backer, right?
[255:26.07]Isn't that what it was?
[255:28.31]Like, the guy that... He donated just, like, enough money to make a character in the game.
[255:32.11]And the Abomination was the character he made.
[255:34.41]I think.
[255:34.67]Right?
[255:37.59]He will bleed from that.
[255:51.88]Indiegogo.
[256:00.67]Mmm, you can't do anything.
[256:01.71]None of this matters.
[256:03.07]They're dead.
[256:04.27]Just give them a turn and let them bleed.
[256:05.77]Let them bleed out.
[256:07.35]Poison goo.
[256:15.72]Congratulations, you did it.
[256:16.72]Anything in this room?
[256:20.16]No.
[256:21.80]Let's go.
[256:22.02]Alright, time for a boss.
[256:24.68]So, what boss are we going to fight right now?
[256:34.04]Jerma, what are you doing?
[256:35.94]Playing Darkest Dungeon on the Nintendo DS.
[256:39.97]I haven't even gone camping yet at all.
[256:49.13]Didn't I just lose this on somebody?
[256:50.62]I just gained it back.
[256:54.80]Alright.
[256:57.20]So, let's take a look.
[257:00.77]Let's go kill the Necromancer.
[257:03.48]The Necromancer.
[257:04.36]The Necromancer Apprentice.
[257:08.04]Bounty.
[257:08.50]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[257:12.36]Let's go get the Necromancer's Apprentice.
[257:21.20]More skill chance.
[257:22.14]Alright, we gotta bring a good team into this, though.
[257:26.91]Necromancer.
[257:30.35]Necromancer.
[257:31.97]Necromizer.
[257:33.15]Necromisome.
[257:35.87]Necrom... Yeah, but the Necromancer.
[257:40.48]New place.
[257:41.48]You can camp in this game.
[257:43.60]You can go camping.
[257:45.22]You can only do it on medium dungeons.
[257:46.44]That's fine.
[257:54.59]Alright, let's see.
[257:55.17]Who do we have available?
[257:58.27]We have you.
[257:59.49]I want a leper.
[258:01.72]I do want a leper.
[258:03.88]In fact, I'm going to upgrade this person.
[258:05.88]Because they deserve it.
[258:08.08]Okay, where's the highwayman?
[258:19.03]Hmm...
[258:23.38]I think I'm going to do an exchange here.
[258:30.63]Yep.
[258:30.89]Let's get this to 20.
[258:41.39]Because I want to do more damage.
[258:43.37]I want to be able to unlock another one of these or armor.
[258:45.09]I'm not sure which one.
[258:47.95]Hmm.
[258:50.01]Armor or weapons?
[258:51.21]What do you think?
[258:58.75]I don't know.
[259:01.33]Probably damage.
[259:06.68]Neck, robe, man, serpent.
[259:09.06]Alright, let's do it.
[259:13.22]Speed base 5.
[259:14.46]Speed base 6.
[259:15.13]6.0.
[259:15.23]Yeah, this is just better.
[259:16.43]Alright, so let's bring a dream team here.
[259:18.37]I'm going to spend some money here.
[259:21.89]Because this is the first boss.
[259:23.19]The first real boss.
[259:25.29]We are taking...
[259:30.07]Him.
[259:32.73]This guy's coming?
[259:33.73]Fuck.
[259:34.01]No, he's not.
[259:34.65]Shit.
[259:37.31]Who's level two?
[259:37.69]Who's level two?
[259:38.62]We gotta sort by level.
[259:39.88]Alright, Bird Jerma's gonna come on this.
[259:46.56]Time Machine Bird Jerma.
[259:49.64]He is gonna come.
[259:50.30]Alright, so that's fine.
[259:54.11]Is that a bad group, though?
[259:55.01]Let me think.
[260:01.31]I have to bring the Occultist.
[260:06.87]Take Egg Salad.
[260:08.83]Look at Egg Salad's stress.
[260:11.25]Too stressed out.
[260:12.11]It's not comfortable.
[260:13.41]I'm not comfortable bringing her.
[260:17.20]Captain Time Machine back at the helm.
[260:22.50]Time Machine has a disease.
[260:28.92]I could bring him.
[260:35.12]Okay, well I can't pull him out of there.
[260:36.74]He's like he's still like drinking Well, it's out I'm bringing bird Jerma bird Jerm is coming He's leveled up and it's fine how are these yeah level these up to I
[261:03.45]Not dream team material.
[261:08.43]I don't want to bring anybody to zero.
[261:09.77]That's for sure.
[261:11.43]Maybe I will bring him.
[261:18.22]Yeah.
[261:18.52]I want some backline damage.
[261:20.30]I'm bringing... Except I'm getting rid of this fucking terrible move.
[261:22.92]Where's the... Blindfire.
[261:27.54]It's the mark.
[261:30.20]The bowl of blindfire.
[261:31.87]Battlefield bandage.
[261:34.40]Clear stunned, clear marked.
[261:37.78]I really just don't like this move.
[261:39.60]I'll probably just do Blind Fire.
[261:46.95]Skeletons can't bleed, so I don't need to... Bleeding is not... I think I'm going to just take a Blind Fire.
[261:53.35]That's plus to speed is good.
[261:55.17]Just like a general shot.
[262:02.52]Hmm.
[262:03.80]Let me look at this.
[262:04.42]Hold on.
[262:09.34]So he needs to be... Buffing targets.
[262:15.45]Disorienting blast.
[262:16.31]That's fine.
[262:16.69]He has stun.
[262:17.19]He's got everything I need.
[262:19.23]He has to be here.
[262:23.41]Suppressing fire is good.
[262:27.21]Maybe.
[262:27.35]Maybe.
[262:31.92]I wonder if this is bad.
[262:36.28]Because then an Occultist here would just kind of... The Forsaken.
[262:40.08]Alright.
[262:52.97]Bowl is better than Suppressing Fire?
[262:54.23]Yeah.
[262:59.13]Suppress, Mark, Snipe, and Vantage?
[263:00.51]Yeah.
[263:05.12]I think this is enough damage, though.
[263:10.96]How many stuns do I have?
[263:11.82]I have one stun.
[263:14.32]I might want to get another stun.
[263:20.42]These aren't Eldritches.
[263:21.57]These are undead coming up here, so maybe I don't need the backline thing.
[263:24.49]Maybe I'll just take the stun.
[263:29.15]I think so.
[263:29.79]I think I'm going to get a shot with these guys.
[263:33.20]Does this guy have a leveled up heal?
[263:34.16]Let me see.
[263:50.75]Uh, he doesn't have a leveled up stun.
[264:02.07]Okay.
[264:03.47]I am ready.
[264:05.07]We're taking in this group.
[264:07.13]Hopefully nobody dies.
[264:13.33]Let's see.
[264:16.21]25% damage.
[264:16.63]I actually might drop the knife then.
[264:19.81]Yeah.
[264:19.93]I'm going to drop the knife.
[264:21.31]Bleeds worthless.
[264:22.05]I'm going to put on the vapors.
[264:25.25]Alright.
[264:25.77]Let's put on the vapors.
[264:30.58]Get in there.
[264:35.41]I'm going to be giving this to the leper.
[264:38.91]Or whoever, right?
[264:45.12]What else do we got here?
[264:45.90]Okay, well, let's see.
[264:52.09]Duelers advanced, that's staying on.
[264:56.01]Wicked melee or point blank shot.
[264:58.59]Yeah.
[264:59.61]We're taking off the bleed.
[265:01.05]And we're putting on point blank shot.
[265:02.35]Because he's probably going to end up in the front of the line a couple times.
[265:04.29]Because he's going to be diving forward.
[265:08.64]Alright.
[265:09.06]Let's go.
[265:09.46]No more planning.
[265:15.46]We've already done plenty of planning.
[265:16.78]What about this?
[265:17.42]Hold on.
[265:19.47]Does the cultist already have it?
[265:22.86]He does.
[265:24.16]Disease resist.
[265:25.12]Stun skill chance.
[265:26.44]Jester only.
[265:27.08]Alright, let's go.
[265:30.44]Let's do it.
[265:32.55]I like it.
[265:35.67]I like it.
[265:37.99]This is buffing himself.
[265:39.67]He'll be a fucking monster.
[265:41.53]He'll be doing like 60% more damage.
[265:48.05]And then take away the bleed and give him point blank.
[265:52.86]Let's knock back.
[265:54.04]I probably should take this off too then.
[265:57.00]That's pretty good though.
[265:57.92]I don't care.
[266:02.44]Yeah.
[266:04.52]Should I take that off?
[266:08.07]For now?
[266:08.91]Because I'm going to be doing ranged moves potentially.
[266:12.95]Although I'm not marking anybody.
[266:17.89]Maybe just put the slice on.
[266:24.34]I'll just take it off, whatever.
[266:32.93]That's fine.
[266:34.43]I'm okay with this.
[266:37.87]I'm okay with this.
[266:40.40]Slice is really good, but I want to be able to shoot behind people.
[266:44.52]Because he might get fucked and not be able to hit anybody.
[266:53.88]I think that's better.
[267:01.74]Alright, I'm prepared.
[267:05.88]Prepared.
[267:07.24]Prepared.
[267:09.16]Prepared!
[267:11.24]Wait.
[267:12.06]Firewood and camping.
[267:14.32]Uh, this is the right one, right?
[267:15.78]Kill the necromancer.
[267:16.56]Yeah, we gotta start camping.
[267:18.64]This is a medium dungeon.
[267:22.88]So that means we need more stuff.
[267:28.95]Like 16 food.
[267:30.81]And like... We'll take like... 12 torches, 16 food.
[267:37.47]Maybe a little bit more food?
[267:38.35]What do you think?
[267:40.43]Camping trip?
[267:43.93]Take a shovel?
[267:44.95]Take two shovels.
[267:46.32]Take a key.
[267:49.52]Get some holy water.
[267:53.85]Three shovels or two shovels?
[267:57.77]Less food?
[267:59.05]Are you sure about that?
[268:04.07]Less food, then somebody says more food.
[268:05.73]I usually take like 16 to 18.
[268:09.92]You know, just to be safe.
[268:14.26]I'm ready to go.
[268:15.48]Embark.
[268:17.00]Bring a tent this time.
[268:21.95]Ten shovels.
[268:26.51]Let's go.
[268:26.81]The Necroventure.
[268:29.05]So this game is fun because there are there are like 20 bosses in this game, right?
[268:34.61]Something like that?
[268:36.25]Like more than 15?
[268:37.23]And each one is like weird and different and does different things?
[268:52.18]I didn't blacksmith the highwayman?
[268:53.56]Yeah, I did.
[268:54.28]A devil walks these halls.
[268:57.15]Fuck!
[268:57.43]Only the mad or the desperate go in search of him.
[269:00.63]Shit!
[269:02.41]It's alright.
[269:02.87]Bert Jerma was gonna do all the da- Oh, I'm so- I thought I did that!
[269:06.23]Ay-yi-yi!
[269:08.57]Fucking, this is a bad place to be.
[269:09.83]I was gonna hope he's down.
[269:14.72]Because if he's over here, I'm gonna be very upset.
[269:16.40]But, you know, there's no way he is.
[269:18.22]Let's go.
[269:21.65]And dead.
[269:22.47]No, not gonna happen.
[269:24.13]Passager unsettling and we're already stressed the fuck out.
[269:29.12]Already stressed.
[269:30.30]And there's a trap here too.
[269:32.10]And he just took like 60 damage.
[269:34.68]Oh, this is great.
[269:35.86]Great start.
[269:43.69]That's fine.
[269:44.85]We're good.
[269:48.00]Um, let's go with a start on the middle guy.
[269:52.04]No.
[269:54.80]Can't even reach him.
[269:56.44]This guy does damage.
[269:59.96]Try to stop him.
[270:00.57]There we go.
[270:03.79]These guys have no blight resistance.
[270:10.91]And this is fine.
[270:12.01]9, 8, 7, 6, 5.
[270:13.03]Oh, he's dead.
[270:13.59]Pfft.
[270:22.19]That's good.
[270:26.01]Dodge it.
[270:28.93]Well, it's okay.
[270:29.30]We're camping.
[270:29.94]When we camp, we're going to remove some of the stress.
[270:31.92]Don't worry.
[270:32.26]We'll be fine.
[270:35.24]This will kill him if I hit another grenade.
[270:38.12]He's dead.
[270:39.66]Goodbye.
[270:40.18]And we're going to go with a heal.
[270:42.94]No, we're going to go for a stab because I just need some core damage.
[270:45.70]And explode him.
[270:47.52]Alright.
[270:51.56]Okay.
[270:52.02]Ooh!
[270:54.86]That's pretty good.
[270:56.91]An antique suit of armor stands amidst the ruins.
[271:02.57]Should I just grab it?
[271:05.19]The armor protects the hero with a high... Okay.
[271:06.91]Well, I did not even know that that was a thing.
[271:10.34]Perfect.
[271:10.62]Come on.
[271:11.08]Tell me he's not right there.
[271:12.78]Good.
[271:13.20]So we go down.
[271:16.16]He's probably down here.
[271:21.40]I feel like I shouldn't touch any of this shit.
[271:25.68]God damn it.
[271:27.26]He's getting so fucked up.
[271:29.38]This guy's opened up a bunch of like... This guy's like reading a bunch of like romance novels and getting like creeped out.
[271:40.19]He keeps opening up like scary stories.
[271:41.95]These guys are so easy to kill.
[271:47.89]Just fucking stab them.
[271:56.05]It's alright, give me the leper.
[271:57.67]Fuck.
[272:01.60]I mean, whatever.
[272:02.24]And not one person got hurt.
[272:04.06]Good.
[272:04.44]Locked display cabinet.
[272:06.44]I ain't using a key.
[272:22.50]I resisted it, thank god.
[272:25.42]Last time I used a key I got $200.
[272:28.18]What a waste.
[272:32.54]I'm gonna say it's this from here.
[272:38.22]Still good on food, still good on torches.
[272:42.51]Lasting effect on the hero.
[272:44.55]Slugger!
[272:48.23]Alright, uh...
[272:52.86]That's pretty good to me.
[272:54.23]That's really good, actually.
[272:59.55]Empty crate.
[273:01.35]Treasure ahead, I'll wager.
[273:02.53]So I need to camp before I go into this last room.
[273:06.09]So remind me to camp.
[273:11.86]Perfect.
[273:18.48]Oh, it better be right here.
[273:19.94]I'm gonna be so fucking mad if it's not.
[273:23.70]I'm going to be infuriated if it's not right there.
[273:29.81]Let's have him do this.
[273:30.49]Let's put some herbs in here.
[273:31.67]Right?
[273:35.09]Boon at last.
[273:35.75]I don't even know what it was.
[273:37.45]I don't even know what that was.
[273:38.61]I apparently clicked it immediately.
[273:40.19]I think it was money.
[273:44.48]Let's get a double swing here and instantly kill both these guys in front.
[273:55.03]I should have... No.
[273:56.04]Whatever.
[273:58.54]Might be able to do... Get some real lucky crits here.
[274:11.67]Poison a spider?
[274:12.37]Well, they only have 20% resistance.
[274:13.25]Okay.
[274:13.47]Don't... Thank God.
[274:26.29]Beast Slayer, another, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[274:30.28]That's two good things in a row.
[274:35.62]Slugger.
[274:37.84]That guy goes first, get rid of him immediately.
[274:39.90]A light.
[274:46.10]Of course he gets to go first.
[274:47.10]That's annoying.
[274:50.31]It's very annoying.
[274:53.97]Let's dive forward.
[274:55.39]He's going to die.
[275:01.79]More power.
[275:08.43]I've got some really good luck.
[275:09.53]I've got some pretty good planning skills and positioning skills.
[275:13.34]I think that's what you meant to say.
[275:18.36]Who does the most damage here?
[275:23.10]Probably you.
[275:32.52]Leper is so good with two people in front.
[275:35.33]If there are two people to stand in front of you and get hit by that, it's so good.
[275:46.93]Really good planning and positioning skills.
[275:56.27]My character has ten luck and one in everything else.
[275:59.29]Yeah, well, whatever.
[276:08.33]Oh, look, another thing to open with a lock.
[276:10.85]I'm doing it.
[276:14.35]That one was worth doing.
[276:15.17]Okay, good.
[276:18.11]Take out the trash.
[276:18.91]Okay.
[276:24.13]Almost there.
[276:25.85]Got plenty of food.
[276:30.67]Just like New Vegas.
[276:33.17]Alright, scout it.
[276:34.91]Alright, I think I'm going to camp here.
[276:37.81]I'm going to camp here.
[276:39.92]There's no reason not to camp.
[276:41.22]I'm going to heal my stress and get buffed up.
[276:42.76]Let's camp.
[276:46.44]So, if you don't know what camping does, is you eat food.
[276:50.69]You'll lose a bunch of stress.
[276:51.48]I'm going to eat all of this food because why not?
[276:54.00]Like I have it.
[276:55.80]And it's going to reduce a bunch of stress.
[277:00.70]And then everybody gets moves.
[277:03.04]You get a certain amount of things you can do.
[277:05.42]So let's see here.
[277:06.58]One companion minus 15% stress.
[277:08.27]One battle.
[277:10.03]Move Blight and Disease.
[277:11.15]Who has a disease?
[277:14.83]I'm looking for... Reduce the torchlight by 100.
[277:18.81]No.
[277:21.50]Minus 25 stress.
[277:22.62]All companions get... All companions get stress.
[277:29.44]Let's remove the stress on you.
[277:34.23]Self only.
[277:35.17]Minus resistance.
[277:36.79]Minus 20 stress.
[277:37.87]Plus 10 AC.
[277:40.85]Why the hell would I not do this?
[277:45.75]He's going to be in the front lines.
[277:47.75]I want him to be doing a lot of the work.
[277:49.18]What about...
[277:53.38]Yeah, fuck it.
[277:54.34]I want it.
[277:55.68]I want the plus 10.
[277:56.40]Because his... He has like a 75% chance to hit.
[278:02.61]Could drop his stress too.
[278:03.67]What about... What do we got?
[278:06.91]Now let's drop his stress a little.
[278:11.84]Too bad nobody has a... Here we go.
[278:13.82]Prevents nighttime ambush.
[278:15.32]This is something I want to prevent.
[278:19.94]Alright, should I roll the dice and prevent being ambushed at night, or should I make myself way better?
[278:25.80]I don't know.
[278:29.97]Why do you have a crappy leper?
[278:31.25]Why is there... Everybody hates the leper so much!
[278:34.35]What do you think?
[278:34.93]More damage, or... Should I make sure we don't get jumped?
[278:40.81]Yeah.
[278:41.55]Always prevent the ambush.
[278:42.62]That's true.
[278:44.70]Okay, anybody else have anything?
[278:48.38]Nothing worth doing.
[278:50.65]Time to go to bed.
[278:55.51]Blessed are we that no fear overtaken us.
[278:57.99]We've used our last log, so that's the state of things.
[279:00.15]Okay, good night.
[279:02.78]Let's go kill the fucking boss.
[279:06.92]Free torch.
[279:14.53]Everybody's good on stress.
[279:16.13]Of course we get jumped.
[279:17.97]Sorry, let's try to get these AIs up before they do any moves.
[279:29.99]Damn it.
[279:30.92]It's okay.
[279:33.06]Oh, I guess I could.
[279:34.12]Alright, here's what we're going to go for.
[279:35.12]We're going to go for a stun on you, so the bleed will kill it, and then the leopard does a double sway and kills them both.
[279:41.74]Didn't quite happen, but that's okay.
[279:44.75]Doesn't even matter.
[279:45.91]Doesn't even matter.
[279:48.65]You see that shit?
[279:49.97]That was a triple.
[279:51.47]Here we go.
[279:53.45]Boss fight.
[279:58.12]There's the necromancer.
[280:02.24]Let's do this first.
[280:05.10]I'm gonna buff the fuck out of him.
[280:10.46]There he goes.
[280:10.88]He's gonna do a swipe.
[280:12.46]Sure.
[280:12.70]That's fine.
[280:15.18]Okay.
[280:18.83]I'm gonna stun the Necromancer.
[280:20.93]He's got such a high stun percentage.
[280:23.71]Chance to not get stunned.
[280:30.78]Drop this damage Put on the riposte and here we go crush Stab the guy in front Now let's do some diseasing You don't have very much blight resistance.
[280:58.78]Do you necromancers apprentice?
[281:00.28]Oh?
[281:04.21]Look at that.
[281:04.91]That's how you fucking counterattack.
[281:06.77]Okay, um... Let's do it again.
[281:13.72]Let's keep the fucking onslaught.
[281:15.36]You know what I mean?
[281:15.78]It's all about the onslaught.
[281:19.96]Easy fucking game.
[281:20.68]It's all about keep up the onslaught.
[281:23.02]He's dead.
[281:23.88]Fucking game over.
[281:25.38]He's double blighted.
[281:26.68]And he's about to die.
[281:28.50]I win.
[281:37.01]Fucking time machine going him.
[281:38.27]That's like five crits.
[281:39.69]Good game.
[281:40.25]That's six crits.
[281:44.43]Don't give him any time.
[281:46.09]Don't give him any fucking time.
[281:49.02]You want to let him sit here and bring a bunch of shit up here and bring a bunch of skeletons and shit?
[281:52.76]No.
[281:53.38]Flawless fucking victory.
[281:54.30]No one even got scared.
[281:56.24]Playing on easy?
[281:56.78]I'm not playing on easy.
[282:01.89]What?
[282:04.02]I'm not playing on the easy difficulty.
[282:07.22]Come on.
[282:11.42]First try, no damage speedrun.
[282:20.23]Easy.
[282:20.53]Is there anything else in here?
[282:27.53]Look at that.
[282:29.47]That's not how it happened.
[282:34.16]DPS check.
[282:35.58]iPad difficulty.
[282:36.70]I'm on the normal like darkest difficulty.
[282:44.28]You know what happened right there?
[282:45.34]I got a lot of good crits.
[282:48.02]And I prioritized targets.
[282:53.38]We haven't even seen a bounty hunter yet, but there you go.
[282:57.61]How dark is the darkest difficulty?
[283:00.15]That was a good team.
[283:02.55]That was a good team.
[283:04.31]They all work together really well.
[283:07.35]No stress pouncing when walking backwards.
[283:08.79]That's good.
[283:12.57]It's because the Necromancer is an easy boss.
[283:14.45]I know.
[283:15.13]I'm just kidding.
[283:23.89]That's good.
[283:24.99]One blueprint.
[283:27.45]Awarded.
[283:31.56]Okay.
[283:33.66]Okay, this is the new DLC shit.
[283:35.22]I need to read this.
[283:35.78]Okay.
[284:01.74]Holy shit.
[284:05.47]There's a lot of information.
[284:07.33]Okay.
[284:11.75]Two additional spite points if you have at least one Abomination, Helion, or Leper in your party.
[284:18.11]Cool.
[284:19.77]Jester has minus 10% stress, +2 speed, and more finale damage.
[284:23.15]That's cool.
[284:23.65]These are so fucking crazy to make.
[284:25.51]Wow.
[284:30.44]Well, looks like I should have been a hoarder.
[284:33.73]Too bad.
[284:37.09]Bank.
[284:38.61]Interest gained on saved gold 5% per week.
[284:43.99]Damn.
[284:45.15]I need 50 paintings.
[284:48.17]The Red Hook.
[284:48.83]A monument with no purpose except proclamation.
[284:50.83]What does this do?
[284:51.31]750 crests and $50,000.
[284:53.12]What does this do?
[284:59.12]Does this give you, like, god mode or something?
[285:03.46]Get the red hook?
[285:04.28]What?
[285:06.76]It's just a money sink?
[285:09.86]Torchlight is more beneficial.
[285:11.16]That's good.
[285:13.60]Hold on.
[285:14.00]Slow down here.
[285:15.34]Granary.
[285:15.72]Plus 15% healing when eating.
[285:17.48]Some food is granted for free each week.
[285:21.20]This one's obtainable.
[285:23.90]So what?
[285:24.22]It just gives me food in my inventory?
[285:25.85]That's cool.
[285:28.91]And this one's pretty obtainable.
[285:30.03]I just have to save these busts.
[285:32.09]Puppet Theater.
[285:35.23]Ten idle stress relief in town per week.
[285:39.17]Increased to ten by ten.
[285:40.31]That's cool.
[285:41.75]Two bottles of the Bloodbrood each week.
[285:45.72]Cool.
[285:45.88]I mean, that seems pretty important later.
[285:50.14]Bounty Hunter, Grave Robber, and Highwayman get plus extra crit and more scouting chance for a hundred fucking portraits.
[285:55.70]I don't know about that.
[285:58.93]Stun resist, healing skills.
[286:00.53]Yeah.
[286:02.35]Max HP.
[286:03.49]This is cool.
[286:04.15]This adds to the game, I would say.
[286:07.57]For sure.
[286:07.87]I'm going to get fucked by the Crimson Curse if I don't build Sanguine Vintage.
[286:19.75]This is obtainable, though.
[286:20.95]So, I can see how that would be obtainable.
[286:22.57]Alright, that's cool.
[286:26.45]Cool.
[286:29.76]and what time is it I think yeah I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna call it a stream here I've been streaming for about five hours now we're going for five hours getting tired I want to keep playing this game though don't leave uh we I did miss some bits though so let me take a look
[286:58.11]So from earlier, yeah, that's going to be... Read the bits.
[287:04.19]Stream more of this game.
[287:04.89]What do you guys think?
[287:06.29]Do you think that you'd want to see more of this?
[287:14.12]Because at this point, the game really opens up here, and this is where you start to have people die and shit.
[287:21.86]Five hours?
[287:22.46]Such a long day.
[287:24.40]Well, it's just midnight.
[287:28.59]I usually don't stream for more than like four to six hours.
[287:34.97]Wouldn't mind another one?
[287:36.75]Okay.
[287:39.21]No, I... This game's great.
[287:40.97]I'm having like a blast.

[287:57.46]So we'll do this for Thursday.
[287:59.06]We'll stream more of this on Thursday.
[288:00.16]Well, I ain't going to do anything.
[288:01.16]I'm literally, the screen you see right here is the screen we're going to come back on.
[288:10.41]Here we are.
[288:12.95]This is intriguing to me because that was, this is like a level one mission and it was that ridiculous.
[288:17.71]So that's cool.
[288:19.89]Alright.
[288:20.37]Good night, everybody.
[288:21.27]See you on Thursday.

[289:27.54]Very nice.
[289:28.80]Rascal, thank you for the bits.
[289:29.97]I usually never can get into side-scrolling games, but I'm actually really interested by this.
[289:34.13]Stream's been great, and I would not have looked into this otherwise.
[289:38.35]Like I told you, I gave this game a look a year ago.
[289:44.62]And I knew that I was going to think it was fun.
[289:46.94]But I knew they were going to make it for iPad.
[289:49.68]And that's just like a shitty iPad gamer.
[289:52.53]That's me being a shitty casual iPad gamer.
[289:55.07]Because I foresaw how fun it was going to be lying in bed.
[289:58.46]So, it is on iPad.
[289:59.68]I don't think the Crimson Court's not on iPad though.
[290:02.12]So, if you're like, oh shit, I'm gonna get it on iPad.
[290:04.44]It's also fucking a dickload cheaper on iPad.
[290:07.96]Can I just be real about this for a second?
[290:10.77]It is... Let's see how much it is.
[290:12.63]It's like fucking 70% cheaper on iPad.
[290:17.19]Let me see if I'm making that number up.
[290:20.57]I mean, it's the same game.
[290:21.37]It's just there's no Crimson Court, I don't think.
[290:24.79]But let me see how expensive this is on iPad.
[290:30.07]Darkest Dungeon.
[290:36.71]Was it on sale?
[290:37.47]I don't think so.
[290:42.74]I can't even look it up.
[290:44.68]Crimson Court sucks?
[290:45.38]It's not good?
[290:45.90]Let me see this.
[291:00.03]Holy shit, it's 25 bucks on iPad now.
[291:02.69]Wait, did I buy, was it like a crazy sale?
[291:04.71]How much did I buy this for?
[291:11.17]No.
[291:12.94]Yeah, okay, hold on a second.
[291:13.70]Look, look, look, look.
[291:14.26]Yeah, it's five bucks.
[291:18.16]Darkest Dungeon tablet edition.
[291:21.20]This shit is $5.
[291:21.54]Right, I'm not out of my mind, right?
[291:26.39]Somebody else look this up.
[291:27.21]Am I going crazy?
[291:29.23]It's five bucks.
[291:33.45]Why are there two listings for this?
[291:39.34]Well, regardless, I'm pretty sure, I'm fairly certain I bought it for five dollars, something like that.
[291:45.92]Anyways, um... That's a deal.
[291:49.50]If it, if this is five bucks on iPad and you've been interested, it's a, that's a fucking steal.
[291:54.28]Lite version?
[291:56.16]No.
[291:58.08]That's only 500 bits.
[292:03.02]Anyways, thanks for the bits, rascal.
[292:06.02]Also, SDSDogman, thanks for the $5.
[292:08.53]Dermot, just want to let you know that I had to unsub because of some hard times going on.
[292:14.09]And I know what you'd say, but I truly want to support you for all the cheer you brought me over the years.
[292:18.27]I can't thank you enough.
[292:19.15]Also, is this game on any other platforms?
[292:22.52]Well, first of all, thank you for the $5.
[292:24.90]I know you know what I'm going to say.
[292:28.23]You know what I'm going to say.
[292:30.69]Don't worry about giving me money.
[292:32.99]You know what I'm going to say about that.
[292:34.85]But I think this is on every platform.
[292:37.92]I'm pretty sure you can get this on PS4, PC, iPad.
[292:42.14]It's pretty much everywhere at this point, right?
[292:45.36]I don't think I'm making that up.
[292:47.02]I might be.
[292:49.00]But thanks so much.
[292:49.94]I appreciate that, man.
[292:53.80]What about the Game Boy version?
[292:56.92]Juge Rotter gave 100 bits, 100 bits, 100 bits, 100 bits.
[293:00.92]Talking about rats.
[293:01.90]More bits because of the rats.
[293:02.96]Look at bits for the rats.
[293:04.46]Where the rats read your bits.
[293:05.78]Last bits until he reads for charity.
[293:08.12]Wait, what am I missing here?
[293:12.58]I'm going to keep donating bits until Jerma looks at bits.
[293:16.56]Look at bits.
[293:17.21]That's what I'm doing.
[293:24.55]What's going on here?
[293:25.85]What did I miss?
[293:27.93]Thank you, Scrub, for the $5.
[293:29.95]Jeremiah, just turn up your brightness and you can play easy Brightest Dungeon mode.
[293:33.77]Kappa 500.
[293:34.25]Yeah.
[293:37.23]I missed a shit ton of bits.
[293:38.29]Did I?

[293:42.16]Turbo Pasta, thanks for the $1.

[294:11.62]Thank you Ba- Okay, so here we go.
[294:12.88]This is what you guys were talking about.
[294:14.42]From like an hour ago or so.

[294:27.79]Now where's my fucking book?
[294:30.87]Uh... Dead Game!
[294:33.27]Hold on, somebody just said Dead Game.
[294:37.61]The DLC for this game came out like 42 days ago.
[294:42.01]It ain't a dead game.
[294:45.23]The Crimson Court came out in like June or July.
[294:47.73]July!
[294:50.63]It's an older game from like last year.
[294:53.76]Dead game.
[294:58.04]Alright, so hold on.
[294:59.88]This is what you'd consider a dead game.
[295:01.90]But people want me to go back and play PlayStation 3 games from like 2008.
[295:05.44]Am I correlating this correctly here?
[295:12.63]Dead game.
[295:14.23]This is like the newest game I've streamed in the last, like, month.
[295:18.79]This is like, the last two months, this is the newest game I've played.
[295:21.69]That's fucking terrible to think of.
[295:25.59]Yeah, going back to playing SEGA CD games from, like, 1996.
[295:33.12]The voice is a different story.
[295:35.42]But anyways, thank you, Bailey, for the $15.
[295:36.67]The book... You know what?
[295:39.83]I'm just gonna... I think I'm just gonna release, like, the... I'm gonna release just into the chat.
[295:44.65]I'm gonna go see... I'm gonna remember my password on Inkle.
[295:47.95]I'm gonna go pull, like, the 30 pages I wrote, and I'm just gonna dump it into the chat and just go.
[295:52.33]Like, who cares?
[295:54.89]I have like 60 pages written.
[295:56.85]Or something like that.
[295:57.51]It might even be like 8 pages.
[295:58.81]I'm just going to dump it in the phone.
[296:00.93]Who cares?
[296:02.53]You'll get to see my fucking madness.
[296:07.21]Anyways.
[296:09.67]Thank you so much, dude.
[296:11.20]Or dudette.
[296:13.62]Growative, thanks for the bits.
[296:14.70]Moo means moo.
[296:15.32]Thanks for the $15.
[296:16.40]Charity.
[296:17.76]Hi, Jermbo.
[296:18.32]Love you lots.
[296:18.84]I was wondering who you would consider your favorite musicians, bands, or genres.
[296:23.10]Just curious.
[296:23.74]Great stream as always.
[296:24.46]Well, thank you, Moo.
[296:25.10]It's the Gorillaz, if you're curious.
[296:29.06]Gorillaz are my favorite band.
[296:30.58]I think Damon Albarn is a very, very talented producer and musician.
[296:34.90]Humans was good.
[296:35.72]I think, obviously, if you're a huge Gorillaz fan, a new album from them, studio album, is huge.
[296:41.74]I think, like, five of the tracks on Humans, I just don't even need to be there.
[296:46.76]But I think that there's some really, really, really great, great songs on Humans.
[296:49.96]So it's the Gorillaz.
[296:56.89]Alright.
[296:57.19]So Jib the Great, thank you for the bits.

[298:18.06]What's the promise?
[298:19.48]I won't forget it.

[298:54.85]That's true.
[298:56.30]Well, hold on.
[298:56.82]Let me, like, sit here for, like, another one minute so I can have a full, like, a five-hour stream.
[299:01.24]Right?
[299:03.90]We gotta sit here for, like, a few minutes.
[299:05.78]One minute exactly, so I haven't... I'm gonna stop the stream at exactly five hours and zero seconds.
[299:11.69]But, see you on Thursday.
[299:12.41]More Darkest Dungeon.
