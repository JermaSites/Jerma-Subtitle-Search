[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.50]Okay.
[00:04.80]Welcome to the stream.
[00:06.66]Hope you all had a good couple last days.
[00:09.58]My name's Jerma.
[00:13.15]If you've never been here before, welcome to the stream.
[00:19.13]Today, we're gonna do some Dreamcast.
[00:21.90]And by do, I mean probably finish the Dreamcast.
[00:26.29]If you notice my voice today, it's very low and booming.
[00:29.57]I've been taking my booming voice supplements.
[00:32.83]I've been taking my vocal supplements.
[00:35.05]So now I can do a radio commercial.
[00:39.55]For a jewelry store.
[00:46.47]They give real bad diarrhea, though.
[00:49.04]I wouldn't recommend taking them.
[00:50.96]Anywho, we got a couple of announcements to make today.
[00:53.14]Something that's been for a long time coming.
[00:58.60]Should have been here a long time ago.
[01:01.86]But it's here now.
[01:04.08]And of course, what I mean is... T-shirts!
[01:09.15]T-shirts!
[01:11.27]There's only one new one.
[01:14.88]But these will be available forever.
[01:17.46]And I want to give you just a quick little sneak peek of what I'm talking about here.
[01:22.12]So, uh, don't look at that!
[01:23.26]You're not supposed to see that yet.
[01:26.32]So, uh, one of the ideas I had for a shirt, I thought it would be really, really cool, uh, because I'm such a huge fan of Star Wars, right?
[01:35.77]So why not make my own Star Wars shirt?
[01:40.53]I love Luke Skywalker, I love Darth Vader.
[01:43.07]So, figured I was gonna have my own version of a Star Wars shirt, and here we are.
[01:48.81]This is the one.
[01:52.38]It's Darth Vader in front of a fireplace for Christmas time.
[01:56.84]You know, look, you understand?
[02:00.33]And I think your friends are going to laugh at this.
[02:02.45]I didn't make this, though.
[02:03.69]This shirt has nothing to do with me.
[02:06.15]I just think you should get it.
[02:08.01]But this is what I meant by t-shirt.
[02:09.93]We're talking about t-shirt day.
[02:12.28]See?
[02:14.08]I had nothing to do with any of this.
[02:16.40]But you and your friends might think it's funny.
[02:18.56]So you should maybe get one.
[02:23.04]Alright, let's show the real one.
[02:30.41]Here it is.
[02:32.85]So halfway through that, I just realized I could have just been sued by Disney.
[02:35.85]So I kind of panicked and stopped that immediately because that's not a lawsuit that I actually want.
[02:42.97]I realized that about halfway through that joke.
[02:47.41]So here is what you can buy starting today and lasting forever.
[03:04.52]Here it is.
[03:07.44]I think I just crashed my OBS.
[03:11.17]Holy shit.
[03:12.69]I just crashed OBS.
[03:14.47]Because I tried to load this.
[03:18.63]Are we still here?
[03:20.51]Hello?
[03:22.43]I just overloaded OBS.
[03:24.92]Well, uh, alright.
[03:26.24]Anyway.
[03:26.64]Um...
[03:31.83]The whole stream just almost went down.
[03:33.91]I almost just broke my computer.
[03:36.95]If you do exclamation point shirts, or if you just go to teespring.com slash stores slash Jerma985, uh, Glue Man is back in multiple colors and multiple cuts.
[03:49.24]And the night sky is the new shirt.
[03:53.06]I wish, I don't know why I just did this.
[03:54.86]So bear with me for a second while I try to figure out what the hell that was.
[04:01.65]Hold on.
[04:02.09]Can I just?
[04:10.94]There we are, OK.
[04:16.80]I think I have to, alright, I'm going to have to make this my desktop background for some reason.
[04:20.93]Why did this have to happen?
[04:24.21]The night sky is literally what happens when you look through a telescope.
[04:29.96]fuck really what's going on with my computer like I actually can't I'm just gonna make it my fucking desktop because like this is I don't know why this won't even just won't work I can't open my file anymore
[04:58.55]Oh, that's interesting.
[04:59.53]Anyways.
[05:02.27]Restart computer.
[05:03.35]I can't.
[05:06.35]Where the fuck... Alright, I think my computer just got electrocuted because I dropped like a thousand frames.
[05:15.45]And it said, overloading CPU.
[05:18.10]And now I can't open files.
[05:20.74]Why?
[05:21.32]Because I...
[05:28.63]Fuck.
[05:32.11]Alright, well, anyways, we're gonna play Crazy Taxi tonight.
[05:36.33]I'm getting a lot of community subs here.
[05:37.75]Let me... This really just threw me off.
[05:40.67]I have no fucking idea why this is happening.
[05:43.44]I was gonna, like, show the image on screen.
[05:45.48]And my computer was electrocuted.
[05:49.70]Here.
[05:50.04]Who cares?
[05:51.34]Fuck this.
[05:52.36]Ready?
[05:54.04]Here we go.
[05:59.61]Well, let me do this first because I want people to see what it actually looks like So this is an old one.
[06:05.94]This is the glue man shirt This is what you can expect There are multiple colors now though.
[06:11.48]There's like three or four colors.
[06:12.94]So that's really cool I don't think it's the exact same t-shirt though.
[06:19.17]I believe this is they no longer have these like American American apparel doesn't exist anymore, right?
[06:24.51]So I think it's next level tees
[06:28.06]It's the highest goddamn quality I could possibly fucking select, and that's not even true either.
[06:32.32]But it was one of the highest quality shirts I could buy.
[06:35.66]To have them put on.
[06:37.40]It's like their premium t-shirt, whatever that means.
[06:41.73]But, uh, that's what it looks like.
[06:43.77]I don't even know what color this is.
[06:46.13]This is like that navy blue, maybe?
[06:50.45]All these were made, all the designs, both of them were made by Ashley.
[06:53.76]So, her link is in those descriptions.
[07:01.12]Name lag?
[07:02.42]Name lag?
[07:03.06]What's name lag?
[07:05.48]Name lag?
[07:19.91]I didn't know.
[07:20.51]We had it mirrored last time.
[07:23.67]That's what it looks like.
[07:24.75]This is the shirt you're getting.
[07:26.01]This is not the exact shirt, but it's very close.
[07:29.88]and they're available permanently.
[07:32.14]These are never, I'm not gonna take these off.
[07:34.70]The Gloom Man shirt, the Night Sky shirt, they are both gonna be available permanently, forever.
[07:39.58]That's a storefront, I can put other shit on that storefront.
[07:42.70]Fuckin' Disney, don't even look at this shirt, this is not even mine.
[07:46.10]That was a joke I made, I wanted to reiterate that, that was just a comedy piece.
[07:49.69]Anyways, forever.
[07:51.33]I'm not taking them down for any reason, they're always gonna be $20, just, if you want one, thank you.
[07:56.61]I hope you like the way it looks.
[07:59.05]And now we're gonna play Crazy Taxi and some more Dreamcast shit.
[08:03.43]I wanna fucking show this on... Why can I not open files?!
[08:11.46]It worked like 35 minutes ago!
[08:20.00]Can you make hats?
[08:20.66]I can make a lot of shit in that store.
[08:25.68]It's... There's a bunch of random...
[08:28.79]storefronts and accessories and iPhone cases and there's a lot of things.
[08:32.79]You can do a lot.
[08:37.17]If I could please.
[08:40.16]I'm gonna try one last fucking thing.
[08:41.80]Because this is like a big deal.
[08:42.74]I haven't had a new shirt in like three or four years.
[08:45.52]So let me just get this fucking situated.
[08:48.86]Because this is fucking dumb.
[08:53.51]I think I got it.
[08:54.69]Come on.
[08:58.21]Come on.
[09:01.03]Yeah, I had to do a little bit of, uh, I had to doctor a little bit of shit, but I got it.
[09:06.40]Okay.
[09:08.08]Finally, my fucking lord.
[09:14.30]Let's go over this shirt, because I've seen a lot of people asking about what the heck is this?
[09:17.88]I haven't even seen it yet.
[09:23.48]There it is.
[09:24.80]Look at that!
[09:25.64]Finally!
[09:27.14]Hey, it only took him like fucking two years.
[09:30.24]Here is the night sky.
[09:33.30]This is the new shirt.
[09:38.75]Just a father and son exploring the outdoors together.
[09:45.41]Taking a look through the telescope.
[09:49.05]clear, beautiful.
[09:50.61]At any point where you are right now, this is what you will see when you look up.
[09:57.28]It's just, you know, me and my dad.
[10:06.59]Why can they see the Earth?
[10:10.13]What are you talking about?
[10:16.98]I mean, they're just
[10:27.36]Yeah.
[10:28.80]I mean, where are they in this scenario?
[10:31.88]You know what I mean?
[10:32.64]That's the best part.
[10:35.96]Where are they?
[10:37.98]What fucking planet are you on?
[10:41.09]No, this is father and son looking at the night sky through a telescope.
[10:45.35]Okay.
[10:51.25]No Saturn.
[10:51.77]No, Saturn wasn't popular enough to be on the shirt.
[10:53.76]Sorry.
[10:58.24]Only the popular planets get to fit on the t-shirt.
[11:08.21]If you understand, uh, design choice-wise, unpopular planets can't fit on t-shirt.
[11:16.55]So, that's how science works.
[11:20.39]If the planet's not popular, then just fucking delete it, they don't care.
[11:28.56]Yeah, that means that they're on one of those planets.
[11:31.91]And guys, Saturn and Mercury, they could be behind that, they're behind there somewhere.
[11:38.27]See the Moon?
[11:38.77]The Moon's very large.
[11:40.55]Bigger than the Sun.
[11:41.35]So, of course that, like, Mercury could probably be behind the Moon.
[11:45.51]This is just what's available from this National Geographic photographer's angle.
[11:59.52]Why do they need a telescope if the planet's that big?
[12:04.07]Because you wanna make- you wanna see what's on the fucking surface!
[12:11.61]And how do you know that?
[12:13.37]We don't know where this photo could be taken from.
[12:23.92]You wanna see the crevices, like what's behind the moon?
[12:26.45]Where are the asteroids?
[12:35.82]But all jokes aside, I love this design.
[12:39.16]I think it's great.
[12:42.48]I think it'll look good on any chest.
[12:50.50]It's a lovely, lovely, lovely t-shirt.
[12:56.81]Yeah, like you guys could be looking through the telescope.
[13:00.05]Right?
[13:00.75]This is potentially two or three different angles melded together in a beautiful fucking incredible design.
[13:09.08]Don't you understand?
[13:13.30]That's you looking through that scope.
[13:16.74]Don't you get it?
[13:23.07]But I have to thank, again, this is Ashley for the incredible artwork.
[13:30.88]And realizing half the dumb shit that I said to her.
[13:34.92]That's really, really fantastic.
[13:36.46]Thank you so much.
[13:37.42]It looks great.
[13:39.64]And you all know what the Gloom Man one looks like, but this is the new one.
[13:49.06]This shirt is only available in black for very obvious reasons.
[13:53.82]Because the father and son in the telescope are supposed to be silhouettes.
[13:58.32]So putting, you know, that wouldn't really look okay on like a green shirt.
[14:03.84]So black is the only available color here.
[14:09.54]The site says only available for three days.
[14:13.67]That's not, no way, that's not true.
[14:16.46]I don't know why it's saying that, but I have it set to... I have it set to permanently be available.
[14:25.90]Only available for three days!
[14:27.65]No, that's... I have like a storefront.
[14:33.49]Let me just make sure.
[14:39.05]So they're printing in three days.
[14:43.09]So how Teespring works is every three days orders get printed and shipped out.
[14:48.97]So I don't know why it says available for three days, but that's just how they print.
[14:54.87]So if you order your shirt today, you know, three days from now, all the ones that were ordered in the last three days are going to print.
[15:06.01]And then it'll start over again.
[15:08.32]And it takes probably like a week or so, maybe a little bit more depending on where you live to get there.
[15:14.09]Well, we'll see.
[15:14.49]Hopefully they turn out good.
[15:15.73]The last time I used Teespring, the shirt came out good and I didn't change anything really.
[15:19.01]So let's hope that they look as good and wear as good as the Gloom Man shirts did a few years ago.
[15:26.68]Anyways, we're going to move on.
[15:29.40]If you want to buy one, they're there.
[15:33.82]And we're going to move on.
[15:35.36]I'm going to play Crazy Taxi.
[15:41.02]and move on to like SEGA bass fishing and maybe a little bit of a jet grind radio.
[15:53.39]Where's the link to the store?
[15:54.29]If you just do exclamation point shirts, it'll pop up.
[15:59.30]It's a Teespring storefront.
[16:00.50]You just kind of click on whatever you want.
[16:04.28]I added, again let me make sure I say that, I added a cut.
[16:07.66]I added another cut for the Glue Man shirt.
[16:11.83]So there's like a women's tee, there's like a unisex tee, there's a couple of them.
[16:16.13]I didn't do it yet for the night sky yet because I figured I'd just let just the t-shirt exist for now, I guess.
[16:29.23]Oh, the shirts have sold out!
[16:30.91]Oh my god.
[16:35.93]Make a dress.
[16:38.31]I can't do that.
[16:38.97]But anyways, thank you.
[16:39.93]It's been a long time coming.
[16:44.75]I know a lot of people have been looking forward to that.
[16:46.42]So have I. So it's good that it's finally available.
[16:54.70]So let's start Crazy Taxi.
[16:57.33]And kind of put a cap on the Dreamcast stuff.
[17:00.34]Maybe not, I say that, but there's still Shenmue.
[17:03.98]In my opinion, that's not Dreamcast stuff, though.
[17:07.42]Shenmue is not the Dreamcast stuff.
[17:12.49]It is Dreamcast, but it's not.
[17:16.43]Because it's coming out on PC now.
[17:17.87]Shenmue 3 is coming out in a few months or something, isn't it?
[17:23.55]Okay, let me make sure this works.
[17:25.29]If it does...
[17:30.67]Give me my controller.
[17:33.93]Seaman.
[17:34.49]Yeah, I'm still, I know, and I'm still gonna play Seaman.
[17:37.45]I'm gonna just load that up one day for fun.
[17:42.35]You will see Seaman, I promise.
[17:46.56]I just kind of got fucked over in the packaging.
[17:49.00]Somebody sent me the... Just disk and no microphone, so that sucked.
[17:56.24]But, let's go.
[17:58.51]Thank you for joining me.
[18:01.04]Joining me.
[18:01.52]I'm gonna turn the lights on in here.
[18:04.44]So Crazy Taxi is a game where you drive around in a taxi and it's fucking crazy.
[18:08.72]Best description, I could probably get it.
[18:09.78]I'm gonna turn the damn lights on.
[18:21.69]So how do you play this game?
[18:22.71]You just drive people around, right?
[18:28.09]We got arcade, original, crazy box.
[18:33.23]What is crazy box?
[18:35.23]We can do arcade, right?
[18:40.11]That makes the most sense.
[18:42.91]Arcade.
[18:43.95]Play by play, play by arcade rules.
[18:46.23]Work for three minutes, work for five minutes.
[18:47.85]Just go arcade rules.
[18:52.63]The box, the box, the box.
[18:53.67]Let me just remember how to play.
[18:55.87]Go ahead and pick a car and driver.
[19:02.11]Alright, let's see.
[19:03.43]I'm gonna be open shirt.
[19:07.47]Oh, okay.
[19:08.53]Alright, so how do you drive?
[19:10.39]Cable car stop top.
[19:11.87]It's probably kind of loud, but it's alright.
[19:15.95]Whoa, the...
[19:31.17]The analog.
[19:32.25]The analog is very sensitive.
[19:42.41]Get out.
[19:44.78]It's also very lucky.
[19:45.98]I'm in 99th place.
[19:46.60]978 miles.
[19:46.96]Um, why did it reverse the controls?
[19:49.16]Um, right trigger.
[19:49.86]Why is it doing this?
[20:02.09]I- What happened?
[20:05.77]Oh, right, okay.
[20:08.34]I can- I have to set it.
[20:09.54]I have to set the gear.
[20:18.35]Six bucks for the jump.
[20:22.25]Man, these are good tips.
[20:31.21]I can't even fucking focus.
[20:35.31]Alright, get out!
[20:39.37]I can't drive on the beach, why?
[20:46.19]Hold on a minute.
[20:47.15]This is important.
[20:49.68]This shit is loud.
[20:50.76]Alright, I'm gonna turn the music up.
[20:55.51]And the sounds down.
[20:56.81]This is hurting my brain.
[21:00.67]Let's go.
[21:08.04]Get in!
[21:10.22]That's gotta go very close, very close.
[21:13.94]Go!
[21:26.27]Get out!
[21:26.99]Alright, that's... That was my practice, don't you understand?
[21:35.62]That was my practice.
[21:52.51]692 bucks for two customers.
[21:54.58]Are you sure you don't want to register?
[21:55.96]I don't want to register.
[21:58.34]No.
[22:00.30]Stop popping up every time I log into your website to ask me if I want to register for updates.
[22:04.39]No, I don't want push notifications.
[22:06.37]I don't want you to email me fucking flyers.
[22:09.09]No!
[22:11.35]Alright, let me do that again.
[22:16.08]Excellent.
[22:24.13]Now I'm ready to get this going.
[22:26.59]Let's try to get like a thousand dollars at least.
[22:28.13]Kip, go stop.
[22:28.81]Yep.
[22:29.39]I'm picking up the same exact person they picked up last time.
[22:31.83]50 cents.
[22:45.43]Fuck.
[22:48.29]Get up.
[22:48.71]Speedy.
[22:49.27]Speedy.
[22:49.77]Alright, we're good.
[22:51.57]70, please.
[22:54.29]Alright, go through the chain link fence.
[22:55.57]Alright, this is big money.
[22:57.37]Right here.
[22:58.87]Yacht harbor.
[22:59.71]This is 1.2 kilometres.
[23:02.87]Alright, gotta get some air here.
[23:14.62]There it is.
[23:16.00]$2.50, good tip.
[23:16.32]$4, good tip.
[23:19.98]Why is everyone just parked?
[23:22.44]What are you guys doing just parking on the fucking road?
[23:33.07]It's the same like SUV.
[23:37.99]Yo!
[23:40.54]Speed it!
[23:43.39]Who's next?
[23:43.75]Yellow?
[23:44.29]Get him!
[23:46.89]That was a pretty nice maneuver.
[23:59.14]Oop, that's not a- Did they get out of the car?
[24:16.24]Whoa!
[24:16.98]What the fuck?
[24:20.81]Move it out.
[24:24.27]Made it over a thousand dollars, right?
[24:25.61]Good.
[24:31.64]PC or Alexa?
[24:32.72]What?
[24:32.98]Can I pick up more than one person?
[24:36.04]I forget.
[24:46.16]Excuse me, excuse me.
[24:53.75]PC port.
[24:55.19]Yeah, well, here's the thing, though, guys, right?
[24:59.27]This is available... Go!
[25:00.49]What the fuck are you doing?
[25:02.37]This is available on Dreamcast, but the PC port was like six bucks or something, and the actual Dreamcast version at lower resolution is, I believe, like at least $30 to $40.
[25:19.08]It's something like that.
[25:19.94]Come on, let's get over 1600.
[25:28.29]Come on, last one.
[25:30.75]Come on.
[25:33.27]Three, two, one, get out!
[25:42.46]That's not gonna be bad.
[25:44.83]That's what I currently have.
[25:45.89]Really?
[25:46.05]That wasn't good?
[25:46.57]I thought that was okay.
[25:47.23]What about original?
[26:03.89]Play by arcade rules in original.
[26:05.75]Alright, let's do, uh... I'm gonna try every person.
[26:12.43]No.
[26:12.69]Fuck off.
[26:13.07]I want the big money.
[26:14.15]This is a $400 affair.
[26:33.65]$1.50 $2 $4 Ooh, near miss.
[26:41.75]A head-on crash got me 50 cents Get out!
[26:57.70]Watch out, out, out, out, out, out, out
[27:02.57]Alright, I gotta turn the car around, right?
[27:05.15]I'm thinking of going down.
[27:13.18]Is it down, or is it...?
[27:21.55]No, I think it is this way.
[27:24.09]I was thinking I could go up a few jumps and make some more money.
[27:30.07]Actually, it kinda worked.
[27:37.43]I thought I could go off, I could jump going down.
[27:40.03]Apparently not.
[27:40.83]There's too many sounds.
[27:58.27]There are a lot of sounds, you're right.
[28:03.96]I need two grams.
[28:07.14]I just have to get in a car accident, because I need to get more tips.
[28:12.30]Like that.
[28:16.32]Oh, that would have been... What is under the car?
[28:17.98]What's going on?
[28:18.71]Why am I bobbing up and down like this?
[28:21.51]What's wrong with my car?
[28:22.41]Oh.
[28:49.64]Alright, I got more than I had last time.
[28:51.52]This is a quick one.
[28:56.13]Alright, near crash.
[29:02.26]There it is.
[29:03.66]Gotta drive on the wrong side of the road to make this money.
[29:10.30]Nice!
[29:11.30]That wasn't bad.
[29:19.85]I immediately picked one up.
[29:21.43]Okay, good.
[29:22.41]Turn around.
[29:26.75]Same deal.
[29:28.27]Oncoming traffic.
[29:28.99]Weave.
[29:35.62]Ooh!
[29:36.72]Ooh!
[29:38.54]Oh, don't even tell me I've never fucking played this game before.
[29:40.58]Because I haven't.
[29:42.10]I did, like, once.
[29:47.60]There we go.
[29:48.26]I better get like a Class B license for this.
[29:50.06]Alright, I need something.
[29:59.89]Come on, get in there.
[30:02.81]Landing here.
[30:04.93]I'm gonna say bang him right.

[30:10.89]Oh, look at this jump.
[30:14.46]Come on.
[30:14.80]Do I have enough strength?
[30:21.09]Apparently, apparently I- Alright, we're still fine.
[30:27.70]Everything's just good.
[30:28.58]We're just- We got hit by a fucking train.
[30:31.48]I think this is where the playthrough ends.
[30:49.05]That wasn't bad.
[30:54.55]God damn it.
[30:55.77]This game's too addicting.
[30:59.45]Might as well do triple A. Is it too loud?
[31:09.38]Should I turn it down?
[31:11.06]Or is it just good enough?
[31:12.32]Alright, original.
[31:13.90]I can do this.
[31:14.46]Play off by arcade rules.
[31:15.70]Alright, let's do, uh...

[32:27.77]I'm gonna clean this up.

[33:28.29]Class E gamer.
[33:29.73]I'm gonna get at least Class B before I change to a different game.
[33:34.10]Watch this one.
[33:41.38]Holy shit, Jermaine, I didn't think you could do that!
[33:44.35]Yeah.
[33:51.43]Dude, I played this game all day, years ago, and I still play it.
[33:56.02]And I didn't even know that was a possible jump scenario.
[34:00.65]Get in.
[34:21.27]Come on.
[34:22.21]Straight away.
[34:27.00]It's not straight away.
[34:31.96]It's that way.
[34:35.87]Ooh, I got it!
[34:37.27]Anybody in here?
[34:37.85]Is that somebody?
[34:41.43]This game's fucking fun.
[34:48.67]Still?
[34:48.97]That is not even good.
[34:51.77]I can do better than that.
[34:53.97]Okay.
[35:03.82]Whoa, don't crash on me.
[35:06.84]Don't crash on me.
[35:10.34]Class C streamer.
[35:11.64]Don't worry.
[35:13.94]I'm not a lot... Alright, so who did I like the most?
[35:16.09]Um...
[35:18.22]Probably BD.
[35:18.78]I think I made the most money with BD.
[35:20.37]No.
[35:21.15]Go expensive first.
[35:23.73]Wave Beach.
[35:24.77]I want at least $200 in tips.
[35:26.99]Count it.
[35:47.95]That's not a tip?
[35:49.17]How?
[35:54.41]You really threw me off with that no tip, dude.
[36:03.54]Air.
[36:06.78]Come on.
[36:07.26]Air.
[36:07.48]I need air.
[36:20.97]Did I actually turn the... How did I go the wrong way?
[36:28.27]Are you serious?
[36:30.17]No.
[36:30.59]Do it again.
[36:33.37]I thought I had to... I thought I cut it the right direction.
[36:41.42]What the fuck was the arrow doing?
[36:42.84]What the hell was that?
[36:44.80]Come on, man.
[36:49.29]Jumped the car, good.
[37:02.81]Ten bucks, come on, more!
[37:04.89]More tips!
[37:05.49]That was the best I possibly could have done that.
[37:12.40]Right here.
[37:17.38]Pizza parlor, this is far away.
[37:23.59]Drive.
[37:28.27]Nice.
[37:30.05]Good cut, good cut.
[37:31.75]Need a better cut than that.
[37:33.39]Like that one.
[37:37.50]That was still a pretty good cut.
[37:53.90]Right here.
[37:54.68]Got another person immediately.
[37:56.54]Big Bits, $50!
[37:57.58]Holy shit, Miniclip, thanks for the 50 bucks, they say slow!
[38:02.74]Wait, wait, wait!
[38:04.36]Hey Jerma, keep up the good work and never stop being speedy.
[38:07.93]Thank you, Miniclips.
[38:08.65]Thank you for the 50 bucks, 5,000 bits.
[38:13.63]It means a lot.
[38:14.13]Thank you so much.
[38:15.89]I'm gonna be fast.
[38:21.67]That's a shitload of money.
[38:22.65]Alright, mini-clips.
[38:26.78]I gotta... I gotta... I gotta make at least $50 in tips.
[38:28.90]Oh, fuck!
[38:38.91]It's too ridiculous!
[38:43.11]Jesus!
[38:43.65]Alright, I didn't make $50 in cash.
[38:46.27]It's okay.
[38:49.49]Anybody around here that I can pick up?
[38:51.22]I need them right now.
[38:54.20]You.
[38:57.32]The Millennium Tower.
[39:02.00]I need to make three grand at least.
[39:11.50]Good, good.
[39:12.04]I need to jump.
[39:13.58]Any jumps around here?
[39:19.12]Shit!
[39:20.92]It's alright.
[39:21.34]It's okay.
[39:21.66]Just build up tips.
[39:23.24]Cut it.
[39:23.48]Okay, we're good.
[39:28.62]There's a Millennium Tower right here.
[39:29.62]Let's go!
[39:39.22]Get in!
[39:46.66]Okay, this is gonna take us out.
[39:48.04]Where the hell am I?
[39:48.60]How do I get out of here this way?
[39:52.94]What was the last?
[39:53.54]The highest I may have was 26?
[39:56.12]I did the same thing last time!
[39:58.56]Oh, fuck!
[39:59.78]I made it.
[40:04.95]Okay, I need another bear.
[40:07.09]Where?
[40:09.21]Bear!
[40:11.15]This way.
[40:16.12]Alright, Grand Mercury Hotel.
[40:21.08]Don't do this to me, game.
[40:21.86]Come on.
[40:29.44]Get out of my fucking way.
[40:30.24]Too many cars.
[40:30.98]Holy shit!
[40:39.08]No!
[40:42.91]Got it.
[40:44.63]Somebody else!
[40:47.34]Is there any other pharaoh?
[40:48.96]Go!
[40:51.62]Yes!
[40:56.54]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[40:57.16]Back to the Millennium Tower.
[41:00.76]That guy just crashed into me.
[41:05.53]What a dick.
[41:07.77]Millennium!
[41:17.35]Tower!
[41:18.87]No!
[41:20.98]Oh!
[41:26.10]Fuck!
[41:26.64]No!
[41:47.67]Crazy box.
[41:48.19]What?
[41:50.77]What the hell is this?
[41:53.97]Crazy box?
[42:00.78]Jump past the K point.
[42:02.22]Stunt challenge mode.
[42:22.42]How do you do this without... What did I do wrong?
[42:25.94]Is there a... like a super mode?
[42:43.65]There's a speed boost.
[42:46.07]How do you do it?
[42:53.68]Pushing in the sticks.
[42:56.64]X, Y, that's the horn.
[42:59.18]That's going, that's reverse, that's... Press the gas right when you shift.
[43:10.94]Okay, there we go.
[43:13.09]That would save so much time if I did that in any of the actual game.
[43:19.25]That would save so much time.
[43:23.64]Okay, cool.
[43:27.90]So that's, you have to be in reverse and then go into gas.
[43:30.74]Go into front.
[43:31.97]Perform crazy drifts to earn a minimum 15 combo within the time limit.
[43:35.83]Crazy Dr- So we're learning, learning the ropes here.
[43:39.43]How do you do a crazy drift?
[43:40.83]You just hold on the brake?
[43:46.69]Is there like another combination of buttons I don't know how to do here?
[44:02.23]What a drift.
[44:02.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[44:06.55]Okay, how am I doing that?
[44:09.13]This is so many more ways to get tips that I wasn't doing.
[44:12.46]How did I just do that?
[44:14.10]I think it's hold?
[44:18.36]Okay, so it looks like you go into reverse, and then immediately into drive while you're turning.
[44:26.13]No?
[44:33.14]No, so you hit both of them at the same time.
[44:34.64]Okay, so you have to do reverse and drive at the same time.
[44:40.16]That's how you drive.
[44:41.84]Alright, so I'll get it this time.
[44:43.22]Press start.
[44:43.76]What do you mean?
[44:45.16]Like, options?
[44:46.68]You don't want, like, controls?
[44:58.32]Yeah, it doesn't... Break horn, confirm destination, gear, drive, reverse, yeah.
[45:03.06]It's not... I just got baited.
[45:10.41]Oh, it's alright.
[45:10.91]I got it.
[45:11.31]I figured it out.
[45:12.65]Alright, we need... Alright, so I need to get a 15 combo.
[45:18.83]Shouldn't be too hard.
[45:28.81]Press start.
[45:39.35]Uh, what is he apparently doing?
[45:44.69]Try it again.
[45:46.33]I think, let me go faster.
[45:49.77]Let's see, how long can I hold it for?
[45:54.03]Can I, like, go across the hole?
[45:55.13]Can I just drift across the whole thing?
[45:59.39]I guess it's like five or six that you can actually add it up to.
[46:05.93]Oh, there we go.
[46:07.43]Alright.
[46:10.49]So you can actually control it.
[46:13.75]Yeah, you can control it while you turn it.
[46:25.89]Take all the customers to their destination within the time limit.
[46:29.51]Let's go.
[46:32.61]109 seconds.
[46:39.78]Advice is the start button.
[46:42.40]You're talking about like at the menu, not like in game.
[46:58.46]why did I lose time what
[47:27.24]Oh, you're over here this time.
[47:28.46]Okay.
[47:36.00]I gotta get used to that.
[47:42.68]It's weird to hit that break like that.
[47:44.34]Have to hit both buttons at the same time.
[47:45.66]Gotta have you... It's A and B together to do that.
[47:51.09]It's kinda awkward.
[47:58.42]Ready?
[48:00.80]Go!
[48:11.99]Fifth? What- what the fuck, why?
[48:14.35]56 seconds.
[48:16.55]Am I insane or did that just say 109 seconds?
[48:28.47]I'm looking at the chat.
[48:30.15]Oh, it was a minute.
[48:31.16]Hold on.
[48:31.56]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:32.72]Alright.
[48:37.48]I mean, that's cli- like, why not just say 60?
[48:41.84]So that's one minute and nine seconds.
[48:48.52]Just count up.
[49:04.33]500 IQ, what?
[49:05.53]I mean, it doesn't say why in all three numbers, the first one should be large and the second two should be small.
[49:22.19]God damn it, I'm trying to, why do I go faster when you do a e-brake like that?
[49:28.26]You like drift and go so fast.
[49:43.93]Welcome to Crazy Taxi.
[49:45.45]I'm just gonna brake normally.
[49:47.01]I could get it if I- I'm gonna do it again.
[49:50.86]Let's do it again.
[49:54.06]It's time to get it.
[49:55.02]Go, go, go, go, go!
[50:15.89]What the fuck?
[50:17.07]Oh, why?
[50:18.45]You have to- that's annoying.
[50:25.49]It is.
[50:28.41]Alright, so let me explain something here.
[50:32.85]You have to press reverse and drive at the same time.
[50:36.95]So when you do that, when you take your finger off, sometimes you're just in reverse.
[50:58.57]He's making excuses.
[50:59.63]You can call it whatever you want!
[51:00.97]I'm just trying to get that down, because it's hard to do that.
[51:23.26]How did I get in your circle?
[51:44.37]Oh my god.
[51:46.13]You have to start that drift to turn around in the middle of the road.
[51:50.67]Like, 150 feet away, at least.
[51:57.61]Let me try that.
[51:58.25]I'm not even gonna do it.
[52:13.99]Just do it.
[52:14.63]Just like drop them off.
[52:16.67]You have to complete stuff.
[52:52.06]I should get it.
[53:00.39]Turn!
[53:03.27]Shit!
[53:09.62]No, I'm not gonna get it.
[53:12.88]I'm doing it in the wrong order.
[53:18.52]That's fucking crazy!
[53:20.64]That's ridiculous!
[53:23.31]How do you control that?
[53:24.79]That's insane!
[53:26.57]Wrong order!
[53:29.59]Aren't they the same distance away from each other?
[53:33.23]Alright, isn't it all the same distance away?
[53:47.39]Oh my lord!
[53:49.89]Wrong order of missions.
[53:52.01]How does that work?
[53:53.01]Let me try something.
[54:01.48]That's fucking crazy.
[54:03.24]Oh my god, how would you ever time that correctly?
[54:24.74]Hold on.
[54:25.52]Get me out of here.
[54:35.67]Wait, hold on.
[54:36.07]So you're telling me that I have to do this, like, Demon's Souls-wise?
[54:38.29]Like, 3-1 is harder than 1-2.
[54:42.13]3-1 is harder than, like, 2-2.
[54:51.92]I thought this was just kind of, alright.
[54:56.83]So I wasn't supposed to do 3, 1 until I knew how to do the other things.
[55:07.80]It goes down like this.
[55:10.40]I thought it was 1, 1, 2.
[55:11.22]Can't you just call it 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9?
[55:25.99]Alright.
[55:30.76]What the hell was I supposed to do here?
[55:36.24]Run over the flag behind the car within the time limit.
[55:43.88]To execute it, shift into reverse, shift into drive to do a crazy drift.
[55:47.89]There's a flag behind me.
[55:58.27]Okay, so... Okay, what?
[56:06.46]I didn't even need to... No, that was... They wanted me to drift, and then... I thought there was, like, a flag behind... I... Alright.
[56:25.13]I got it.
[56:33.82]Why does it want me to do the crazy drift here?
[56:37.96]Pop all the balloons within the... Okay, pop the balloons.
[56:40.48]You have to get a crazy dash right after a crazy drift.
[56:45.68]Crazy dash is... Let off the... Let off the accelerator, shift into D, press the accelerator.
[56:54.77]Okay.
[56:58.09]Let's see.
[57:07.19]Oh boy, that's hard to do that.
[57:08.29]I mean, what if I'm already... Okay, hold on.
[57:11.33]What if I'm already in Reverse... If I'm already in Drive?
[57:18.96]That's so confusing.
[57:19.96]So, if you're in Reverse... You have to be in Reverse.
[57:31.88]I just gotta learn how to do that.
[57:32.86]So if you're doing a drift, shift into drive and then do accelerate.
[57:40.49]But what if I'm not in?
[57:43.93]That makes no sense to me.
[57:46.23]So, hold on.
[57:51.44]No, no, no, back, back, back.
[57:55.54]A crazy dash is you let off the accelerator and then you have to shift into drive and then press the accelerator, right?
[58:02.32]To do a... To do a... No, god damn it.
[58:05.46]I want to look at the... You have to shift into reversed and then shift into drive.
[58:23.42]But you have to shift, so... Is it just like a practice arena?
[58:35.88]So, hold on.
[58:48.13]Just set up a macro?
[58:52.93]That seems really hard to do.
[58:55.67]Reliably.
[59:00.75]How the fuck am I supposed to shift back into drive after shifting from reverse to drive?
[59:10.28]Let off the accelerator.
[59:22.20]Well, shift into reverse, drive, shift into drive.
[59:28.01]Okay, well, I'm just gonna play.
[59:30.51]I'm just gonna try to do it.
[59:36.67]Uh, what is 2, 2?
[59:37.11]I don't know.
[59:41.19]You gotta go into reverse, turn, and then drive.
[59:46.87]Well, let me just try to do this with my new techniques that I've learned.
[59:49.33]Alright, that's good.
[59:52.10]Even that alone is gonna help.
[59:54.84]No, it's not.
[60:17.44]Oh my god, that's not helping at all actually.
[60:21.50]The drift just makes you go crazy.
[60:31.99]Jesus!
[60:43.48]I'm just killing people.
[60:52.39]Ugh.
[60:54.97]A, B, oh, that's annoying.
[60:56.95]I think I'm not still working.
[61:05.38]I should be.
[61:07.96]Alright, frame rate.
[61:08.96]What the fuck is going on here?
[61:14.72]Okay, I'm gonna track her drift.
[61:20.01]The drift uphill.
[61:21.51]What a great idea.
[61:27.92]I mean, that was kind of cool.
[61:29.08]That should be... No, but I'm in reverse.
[61:32.66]What the fuck is happening?
[61:45.51]I've done, like, exponentially worse since involving the, like, advanced techniques.
[61:51.67]See, now I'm in reverse.
[61:52.69]I don't like that mechanic.
[61:55.96]The handbrake should not be reversed.
[61:59.78]He's complaining!
[62:06.11]Only two dollars for me driving into a train and in the last second pulling away.
[62:21.84]Holy fuck, that was twenty dollars.
[62:25.27]Hold on, I'm gonna try it again.
[62:33.54]That's too fast.
[62:40.65]Somebody mentioned, it probably would be insane to see somebody do like a super expert, like 3000 hours in Crazy Taxi gameplay.
[62:48.89]That would be really insane.
[62:59.46]I'm only going to use those techniques when I need them.
[63:02.42]Like, for instance, right there.
[63:06.90]And then be in reverse.
[63:10.84]I thought those were just tables.
[63:12.68]Like, picnic tables on the street.
[63:28.89]Oh, I can't go in that way?
[63:31.33]This is all wrong.
[63:32.71]Really?
[63:33.11]Let's go.
[63:33.87]Come on.
[64:10.43]there it is come on get out 17 bucks a lot of money let's go
[64:41.48]That would've been clean if that asshole wasn't in the way.
[64:45.26]Too many cars to do this.
[64:49.59]Undriftable.
[64:50.15]Too many cars.
[65:11.82]Goddamn drift acceleration!
[65:15.98]Sorry.
[65:24.77]Oh my god, please.
[65:32.59]Turn.
[65:34.35]Turn around!
[65:58.49]Don't go for that jump.
[66:02.11]Get out of my way.
[66:03.19]It's right here.
[66:06.67]I need somebody right now.
[66:11.28]Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody.
[66:12.42]Anybody.
[66:12.92]Anyone.
[66:13.70]Anyone.
[66:14.18]You.
[66:16.00]Get in.
[66:22.71]Why?
[66:23.75]That's so hard to fucking do that reliably.
[66:25.87]Like, actually win a game without sitting there.
[66:29.09]I don't think I'm gonna make it.
[66:45.84]No, no way.
[66:51.13]Jesus Christ.
[66:53.03]We're gonna see.
[66:54.67]Again.
[66:55.39]I'll give it a few more attempts.
[66:58.23]Before we move on.
[66:59.93]Because we got a lot of other shit to do.
[67:21.31]He got worse after he trained.
[67:22.73]Yeah, because the techniques you have to do are actually fairly difficult to pull off in a game scenario.
[67:35.52]Like, those drifts?
[67:36.78]You get tips, but you don't complete.
[67:42.04]I mean, like, holy fuck, that was a lot of money, but I screwed myself up.
[67:45.02]I lost, like, four seconds.
[67:56.63]What the fuck does this want me to go?
[68:16.95]What?
[68:18.41]Okay, what the fuck is this?
[68:25.96]No, hello?
[68:28.74]What the fuck is happening?
[68:30.56]What?
[68:33.82]Oh my fucking, give me a break.
[68:37.70]Really?
[68:43.89]That was annoying.
[68:47.07]Nice job Xbox.
[68:53.07]You just decided to turn down, you just turned the controller off.
[68:57.41]That was great.
[69:00.81]That was really fun.
[69:01.77]Imagine if I was, like, at Gwyn in Dark Souls and that happened.
[69:07.94]Get out!
[69:29.10]Get it!
[69:34.21]I'm gonna go... It's the same person that... Where the fuck do you want me to take you?
[69:38.85]Every way is the wrong way.
[69:39.79]Well, this is the right way.
[69:57.13]Get out!
[70:11.39]Boink boink!
[70:11.79]Not bad.
[70:23.72]Alright, I gotta just focus on the next couple and just actually deliver people.
[70:39.14]I need time.
[70:40.14]I'm not doing... I'm not delivering nearly as many people as I was before.
[70:51.33]That's like cut in half.
[70:54.15]I don't get it.
[71:01.53]Let's see if I can get this delivered.
[71:18.29]I don't know.
[71:19.13]Unless it's somebody right here.
[71:21.73]Class D license!
[71:23.35]This isn't the right soundtrack.
[71:47.44]Alright, last try.
[71:49.63]Last try.
[71:51.73]To get above C. Last attempt.
[71:53.55]It's clean.
[71:53.91]Only drift when I need to.
[72:15.96]Not right there.
[72:16.81]It's okay.
[72:17.05]Get out of the car!
[72:30.22]Get out of my fucking car!
[72:36.68]Oh, come on.
[72:37.32]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[72:38.25]Lots of fucking time now.
[73:05.71]Hit the jump.
[73:06.29]Come on.
[73:07.41]Nice.
[73:15.76]Where the fuck am I going?
[73:17.26]What the hell?
[73:17.98]This is far away.
[73:35.09]Use car shop.
[73:39.61]What the fuck?
[73:48.54]What the hell?
[73:49.36]No!
[73:52.84]What the?
[73:53.50]The fucking arrow just like freaked out.
[73:57.27]Oh god damn it.
[73:59.29]What?
[73:59.81]I'm not gonna make this jump.
[74:03.75]What the hell was that?
[74:08.77]I still... It's okay.
[74:22.18]Just get... I can build time.
[74:25.20]Somebody right there.
[74:31.77]Get out.
[74:34.94]Whatever, doesn't matter.
[74:38.89]Trying to pull off something there, but I couldn't.
[74:52.56]Alright, just drive.
[74:53.90]Get there.
[75:00.62]Oh my fucking lord, that arrow.
[75:02.50]Just point over here.
[75:07.74]No, I'm not gonna get it.
[75:20.26]Not gonna get it.
[75:26.15]This game is so hard.
[75:27.93]It's so addicting, but it's so difficult.
[75:33.04]I can't imagine what a perfect gameplay this looks like.
[75:35.50]Holy shit, it's probably amazing.
[75:36.90]Alright, one more time.
[75:40.26]Last try to do this.
[75:58.99]I'm gonna go with you first.
[76:00.61]You've ruined it.
[76:01.21]Retry.
[76:01.79]Last try.
[76:02.31]Last retry.
[76:03.15]One more retry after this if I fuck it up.
[76:04.67]One more retry after that, and if I do one more retry after this, one final retry after the last retry.
[76:08.04]You understand?
[76:08.90]Go.
[76:09.00]Alright, no fun- no funny business.
[76:20.52]Just try to get above the C. I can do it.
[76:26.55]I'm doing a little bit of funny business there.
[76:28.03]It's good.
[76:28.59]It's okay.
[76:37.96]Fuck!
[76:39.42]Don't freak out.
[76:40.22]Easy.
[76:46.27]What?
[76:46.71]Okay, that's one retry.
[76:48.35]Ugh.
[77:00.07]That's a that was a good start don't blow it Good start very good Exceptional quality
[77:22.54]My controller just ripped!
[77:26.14]I just got possessed.
[77:27.70]I didn't do that.
[77:38.00]Okay, use car shop, I know what that is.
[77:45.13]It's literally right here.
[77:50.15]Easiest one I've done all day.
[77:54.44]Get it?
[77:56.02]Big Hills Park.
[77:57.00]Alright, get some money.
[78:08.11]Stupid fucking Winnipeg.
[78:09.01]I'll get out of my way.
[78:13.31]No drifting, just good driving.
[78:17.47]That still qualifies as good driving.
[78:22.41]Still qualifies as good driving.
[78:33.34]Get in the car, dummy!
[78:44.25]Nice.
[78:45.41]Just thread the needle.
[78:51.04]Just go!
[78:51.38]Just go, go, go!
[78:51.88]Keep going down this way.
[78:52.50]You can wrap around.
[79:09.59]No, he's unraveling!
[79:11.19]He's unraveling!
[79:36.02]Oh, no!
[79:36.98]What the fuck is this traffic?
[79:40.90]It's over.
[79:48.43]It's over.
[79:48.93]I don't want to see the fucking end, I don't care.
[79:53.47]Goddamn!
[79:55.74]This is so hard!
[79:57.70]Ugh!
[80:04.66]How did I get like 2,800 alls that last time?
[80:12.34]No, it's alright.
[80:19.27]Get out there.
[80:34.73]That was bullshit.
[80:35.25]Here we go.
[80:36.03]Ready?
[80:36.47]One, two, three.
[80:36.97]I'm gonna be quiet.
[81:04.62]With this long mission, I will conquer the world!
[81:16.47]So I just wait and see!
[81:33.58]It didn't fucking work.
[82:03.60]My god, I got why what I This is how they got all your quarters for the arcade Oh
[82:41.74]You know they stole all your quarters.
[82:43.10]And by quarters I mean, this is like 75 cents for one play.
[82:48.51]Three coins, really?
[82:49.37]I'll take that fucking cash money thing.
[83:04.45]I need another person.
[83:08.87]I'm not gonna make it, no way.
[83:17.41]No, I'm forever stuck at like $2,000.
[83:19.59]Forever.
[83:30.64]What just happened to the assets?
[83:31.96]They all just... What's going on?
[83:33.28]I got it still.
[83:38.04]Get out of my fucking car!
[83:44.13]Where is this?
[83:44.53]The beach?
[83:51.76]Fuck off.
[84:07.51]What is happening?
[84:08.85]I'm not gonna even get it.
[84:16.28]Get out of my fucking car now.
[84:18.02]Who's right here?
[84:18.48]Anybody?
[84:20.52]Forever stuck at like 2,500.
[84:21.34]Come on.
[84:33.70]I have to get it.
[84:35.82]I have to get it.
[84:36.56]I can't move on yet.
[84:37.74]I have to get beat.
[84:41.46]Six customers though.
[84:42.42]It's getting better.
[84:44.22]I got it.
[84:50.74]I have to do this.
[84:51.66]Gotta get that right off the bat.
[84:53.32]Gah!
[85:19.61]Okay, this is the equivalent of me at the arcade.
[85:22.21]I'm ripping the cord out of the back where it's plugged into the wall at Dave & Buster's.
[85:26.98]And I'm plugging it back in.
[85:28.80]I'm gonna get thrown out.
[85:47.30]Get it.
[85:47.66]Come on.
[85:48.40]This is the one.
[85:57.53]I almost just ripped the cord out of the wall.
[85:58.83]It was close.
[86:06.36]Hey, hey, hey.
[86:08.30]It's time to make some crazy money.
[86:10.32]Are you ready?
[86:11.16]Here we go.
[86:17.12]Got it!
[86:18.62]This is the one!
[86:48.69]Get up.
[86:55.06]Pizza parlor, let's go.
[87:28.57]Didn't even see that guy.
[87:30.17]That guy didn't even load.
[87:38.23]I'm in the worst possible position, no!
[87:45.22]Ooh!
[87:49.24]Use car shop, I know what that is.
[88:00.10]I gotta get green here.
[88:11.89]I thought the Darum were turning!
[88:51.02]Fuck you, you fucking bust.
[88:52.36]Oh my god, restart it!
[89:14.03]Now, the only way you can get, like, an A or an S rank in this game, is if you landed here in a spaceship, like, 400 years ago.
[89:22.79]And you've been, like, just, you're just wearing, like, people's skin, and you're just pretending to be a person.
[89:30.86]You've been, like, jumping around from body to body, you're like, oh, that was fun being Julius Caesar for a week.
[89:36.10]That was fun.
[89:38.86]Let me try, let me try like crazy taxi fucking world record holder.
[89:43.84]That sounds fun.
[89:45.34]You got your inhuman reaction.
[89:50.90]Getting stabbed.
[89:59.85]Like the level of skill required.
[90:01.51]You definitely are just, you land, you have to land here.
[90:05.01]You, oh, you got like the powers.
[90:07.34]You got possessed.
[90:08.38]You got, like, the gamer powers.
[90:09.70]Alright, here we go.
[90:15.88]Alright, let's wrap around.
[90:33.56]Get out.
[90:35.29]Somebody right here?
[90:36.27]Yep, got it.
[90:36.91]Good.
[90:43.47]It's right around the corner.
[90:46.81]$87.
[90:46.83]That's some bullshit.
[90:53.68]A fucking goddamn trash can is gonna stop me.
[91:17.60]Somebody standing right here.
[91:23.16]Get in.
[91:33.15]Decent.
[91:33.45]I got decent time here.
[91:52.34]Get out.
[91:58.04]Get in.
[92:00.28]Come on, boost it.
[92:08.64]Get out.
[92:24.11]This is the one.
[92:26.75]Fried chicken shack is- I think it's to the left.
[92:40.98]There it is.
[92:44.34]Get in my car.
[92:47.85]Across the street.
[92:48.37]Get her!
[92:58.37]I just shot that guy with a shotgun.
[93:01.29]I car-shotgunned that guy.
[93:02.55]That's every time.
[93:16.61]Don't take that right.
[93:17.83]Good call.
[93:18.78]Good call.
[93:20.42]Good call!
[93:38.18]Same thing.
[93:38.78]Straight down.
[93:46.28]Straight down.
[93:48.44]Green.
[93:48.78]Got it.
[93:51.20]You idiot.
[93:51.96]You idiot!
[93:53.21]Stop!
[93:53.55]Just... You fucking dumb idiot game.
[94:04.14]It went into reverse.
[94:05.06]God damn it.
[94:06.10]That's alright.
[94:06.42]I'll get it.
[94:06.66]I'll get it.
[94:06.90]This is good.
[94:12.29]Please accelerate.
[94:13.43]Oh, you idiot.
[94:21.15]I mean, not even smart.
[94:22.18]I'm smart.
[94:23.68]Look at that.
[94:24.04]Not even smart.
[94:25.10]I'm smart.
[94:25.82]This game's not smart.
[94:26.66]You know what I mean?
[94:36.72]Out of my way.
[94:38.50]What the fuck did you just do, Arrow?
[94:40.18]Why did you do that to me?
[94:41.92]What was the point in you doing that, Arrow?
[94:44.62]Unbelievable.
[94:46.36]Truly unbelievable.
[94:52.17]Got a new character right here.
[95:08.11]I don't know where it is.
[95:15.64]That's $3,400.
[95:16.06]That's $3,400.
[95:16.38]B. Oh, yes.
[95:16.84]I can... Whew, I can... Yeah.
[95:20.98]Yes, this game's so good.
[95:24.20]Can I get... I'm gonna try to get possessed by a demon.
[95:38.06]I'm not a demon, I said, I mean alien.
[95:40.76]I mean, what was I saying before?
[95:43.18]Ah, okay, now I can do it again.

[100:54.67]Get it.
[100:54.93]You got it.
[101:02.79]I need $5,000.
[101:03.21]I can get it.
[101:03.89]That would be perfect.
[101:09.16]This stupid game sucks.
[101:11.04]No it doesn't.
[101:11.40]No.
[101:11.62]Come on.
[101:19.73]I need somebody else.
[101:27.37]Get out of the car!
[101:28.75]3900 is gonna be a B!
[101:53.84]I can do it.
[101:54.36]I know I can.
[101:55.14]I can do this.
[101:56.14]I can do it.
[101:58.14]Don't pick... I had to pick... Reg was the closest one.
[102:00.18]It's alright.
[102:00.54]I'll get it.
[102:02.28]I'm gonna get A. I got it.
[102:03.56]5,000.
[102:03.66]I got it.
[102:04.38]This is the last try.
[102:09.92]For real.
[102:11.42]I got B. I already proved that I'm a B streamer.
[102:13.30]Cleaned up.
[102:31.35]No unnecessary accidents.
[102:34.33]Good.
[102:45.06]Get out.
[102:45.54]Good.
[102:45.94]Perfect.
[102:53.18]Oh my god, what am I stuck on?
[102:55.38]Please, game.
[102:56.24]What the fuck was that?
[103:11.39]There were only reds around too.
[103:12.59]That sucked.
[103:14.31]I literally got stuck on dirt.
[103:22.54]That was absolute bullshit, because that was a great first round too.
[103:27.46]But I drove over dirt.
[103:28.76]Sorry.
[103:47.87]I'm not fucking around anymore
[104:36.82]Right there, yellow.
[104:37.44]Stupid fucking arrow.
[104:59.90]What the fuck just happened?
[105:01.26]I just teleported into another dimension.
[105:03.64]This is the wrong way.
[105:10.84]Yeah, it's over.
[105:14.96]I blame that first, that arrow.
[105:16.58]Spinning around in a fucking circle for no reason.
[105:18.32]I can still salvage it.
[105:21.78]It's possible.
[105:22.56]Get him.
[105:37.47]No, I can't jump any of this.
[105:49.07]Still possible Any greens?
[105:54.71]There's a green over there Or a light green
[106:15.88]Park.
[106:16.16]I can do it.
[106:20.60]Alright, speed it up.
[106:40.39]Still green, come on!
[106:44.25]Yellow, right in front of me Stop slapping 5 and pick up another customer
[107:05.13]Did I want to jump that?
[107:06.09]I don't think I wanted to jump that.
[107:07.41]Fuck, I wanted to jump that, I think.
[107:10.93]No!
[107:12.27]No, I wanted to jump that.
[107:13.69]For some reason, I thought that was going to take me in the wrong direction.
[107:21.65]Stuck in B forever.
[107:27.79]Alright, this is the last try before I uninstall the game forever.
[107:33.80]After that one.
[107:34.66]I'm so close, but so far.
[107:55.42]When you come to a complete stop in this game, honest to god, it is so hard to start driving again.
[108:01.67]Even when you do this bullshit.
[108:05.39]Half the time, don't... It's alright.
[108:39.22]Get out!
[108:41.70]Get out of the car!
[108:43.39]No, I didn't want this guy.
[108:57.07]I'm turning around and getting that person back up there.
[108:58.55]I don't want any of these people here.
[109:07.46]Let me just get stuck on an object real quick.
[109:10.46]It's so annoying.
[109:12.88]It's alright.
[109:13.30]Relax.
[109:13.96]What the f- Why do you have the handbrake on the same button that- REVERT!
[109:45.49]This one's... this one's... this one's a dud.
[109:48.07]God damn it.
[109:51.07]I forgot this is the one that makes you... this is the worst one to pick up, because the arrow just points around in a circle the whole time.
[110:12.64]There's nobody even here.
[110:16.76]Oh great, they pick up a red.
[110:23.16]I can't restart.
[110:24.94]I'm gonna get trapped here forever.
[110:27.28]I'm never gonna leave.
[110:28.30]Do you understand?
[110:29.76]I have to get out of here.
[110:32.21]I'll never leave.
[110:33.19]I'll sit here until I'm 75 years old.
[110:35.93]I'll just get food delivered to my house every day.
[110:42.33]I'll have like a bathroom bag.
[110:43.93]I gotta get out of here.
[110:51.04]No!
[110:52.34]Oh god, just... How do I stop this?
[110:54.24]How do I stop this?
[110:58.48]I'm so addicted.
[110:59.26]I can't stop.
[111:00.70]I have to get out.
[111:13.04]Just park the car?
[111:13.95]That's not a bad idea.
[111:15.89]Alright, last one.
[111:16.89]This is actually the last one.
[111:20.81]No, no, I have to sit.
[111:21.97]Just go!
[111:22.41]Go!
[111:22.69]Just the last one.
[111:32.04]I'm exhibiting self-control.
[111:40.33]He's green right in front of me.
[111:43.89]Get him.
[111:47.71]Cafeteria.
[111:48.31]Come on, frame rate.
[111:56.01]What the hell are you doing?
[112:06.01]That's pretty cool.
[112:12.31]I don't even know where the fuck this is.
[112:14.39]Down here?
[112:16.32]It's all the way down here.
[112:31.93]No!
[112:33.91]No, no, no, no!
[112:37.57]Oh, I hate it.
[112:41.03]Oh god, come on!
[112:43.74]Come on!
[112:46.28]Four fucking walls!
[112:48.86]Ugh, it's painful.
[112:52.44]God damn it.
[113:04.79]Oh my god, it's not over.
[113:12.63]Get the fuck out of my way, you stupid idiots.
[113:28.76]Just trying to get points and I can't even get up there.
[113:31.46]There's so many cars on this road!
[113:37.77]The Simpsons hit and run all over again.
[113:39.53]There's one behind me.
[113:42.63]Marine.
[113:49.22]Oh, fuck you.
[113:50.94]Fuck you, train.

[113:58.70]No.
[114:12.47]Oh, fuck you.

[116:30.91]Where is he?
[116:32.81]Get in.
[116:44.19]Why is my framerate dying so much on this turn here?
[116:47.25]Always.
[116:56.67]Alright, it tried to fuck me over, but I got it.
[116:59.23]This is it, this is the one.
[117:02.99]Shh, quiet.
[117:19.67]Am I turning left?
[117:20.71]I am.

[119:20.58]Yoshi, I swear to fucking God, why won't you do it when I ask you to?
[119:41.23]This is to the right.
[119:46.81]No, it's not.
[119:47.39]I got baited again.
[119:48.19]It's right here.
[119:52.57]Alright, I need a... Got a guy right here.
[119:54.97]Get a record store.
[120:01.99]Let's go.
[120:04.81]3, 2, 1, Yoshi!
[120:06.01]I hate this game.
[120:17.43]I'm good.
[120:31.49]Inhumans, go!
[120:38.54]Get out!
[120:54.40]I'm gonna get them.
[120:55.60]Shh.
[120:56.10]Don't even look at the number.
[120:58.06]Just focus.
[120:58.38]Itchy face.
[121:09.37]Fucking face is itchy.
[121:10.67]I need an automatic face itcher.
[121:22.82]Fuck!
[121:28.00]He's gonna get out of the car!
[121:30.02]Oh, you stupid goddamn game.
[121:31.96]Stupid face!
[121:34.40]Unbelievable.
[121:44.15]Un-fucking-believable.
[121:46.05]He's going so well.
[121:48.11]And then, like, a bunch of itchy particles had to land on my face.
[121:53.75]How dare they when I'm in the middle of a Gamry moment.
[122:10.87]Getting close.
[122:17.96]Okay.
[122:18.60]Marine plaza.
[122:19.38]That's back this way.
[122:26.22]Fuck it.
[122:26.56]It's okay.
[122:27.08]As long as I can have a 5,000.
[122:27.86]That's all I care about.
[122:29.00]There's nowhere for me to go.
[122:39.99]Yeah.
[122:40.17]See?
[122:40.39]Look at that arrow.
[122:40.95]Look what that bullshit arrow's doing right now.
[122:42.95]Come on.
[122:43.71]Give me a break.
[122:44.12]We're good.
[122:59.11]Don't fucking do anything.
[123:05.34]Alright, let's go.
[123:06.62]I got this.
[123:06.98]I'm gonna get, like, fucking 7,000.
[123:08.70]That's gonna get S. Slow down.
[123:19.16]Not me.
[123:21.04]Them.
[123:29.43]Get out!
[123:29.77]Get out of the car so I can get the green!
[123:33.70]Speaking of green... Yes!
[123:37.84]Thank God the tire was still there.
[123:47.05]How many customers have I had so far?
[123:49.31]I feel like this is ages.
[123:58.50]I think it's the right head.
[124:07.00]Move.
[124:12.17]This is the part where the arrow doesn't make any sense.
[124:14.31]Alright, good.
[124:23.17]Yellow.
[124:26.95]Smith Club is... What the fuck?
[124:43.50]It's alright.
[124:43.92]It's okay.
[124:44.12]Just get it together.
[124:52.20]Sir, what?
[124:53.59]Sir.
[124:54.73]Uh, arrow.
[124:56.11]Okay.
[124:56.45]Get out.
[124:57.41]Hello, just kidding.
[125:10.93]Over $7,000 is what I'm gonna get here.
[125:12.79]It's gotta be perfect.
[125:19.71]No mistakes.
[125:20.59]Zero.
[125:22.31]That's not a mistake.
[125:27.49]Oh my god, I hate the other people driving on the other fucking side of the road.
[125:33.93]Not gonna get it.
[125:38.40]Nope.
[125:38.64]3, 2, 1, not good enough.
[125:41.44]$6,700.
[125:41.46]Fucking people just driving on the other side of the road.
[125:44.68]Like, how un-fucking-believable.
[125:46.30]By the way, that's an S ranking!
[125:47.88]I see it on my achievement, I win.
[125:51.64]That's it, get me out, I'm done.
[125:52.88]Dude, quick, get me out, quickly, quickly.
[126:05.41]What happened?
[126:13.31]No, good.
[126:13.93]The game, like, the game, like, fucked up.
[126:15.31]Good.
[126:16.01]I fucked it up.
[126:22.84]I just, I didn't mean to.
[126:23.52]I got, like, really loud right there.
[126:25.24]But I didn't mean to.
[126:27.55]I just skipped the credits.
[126:29.11]I don't... Then it crashed the computer.
[126:32.87]That's okay.
[126:33.11]Okay.
[126:41.49]um crazy taxi's still running it says can I like hopefully this doesn't turn off obs still live yeah okay uh did I actually skip the credits that sucks I didn't even mean to I got s and that's an s ranking and that's an s ranking oh quiet Jeremy
[127:11.63]There's like a 13-year-old that just did that in an arcade like five minutes ago.
[127:21.76]Alright, I think something's wrong with the computer now.
[127:24.86]Because there's a little box that's floating in the middle of my screen.
[127:32.36]I'm not sure I'm going to be able to load a game.
[127:37.12]Let me see, hold on.
[127:41.43]No, I guess we're okay.
[127:47.00]That was crazy, Taxi.
[127:48.18]It's awesome.
[127:49.82]The game's a blast.
[127:51.92]And now we're going to move on to Space Channel 5.
[127:58.97]Somehow, this is Space Channel 5 Part 2.
[128:10.27]Let me just make sure it is correctly... Now that's 1280x720.
[128:14.07]No, no, no, no.
[128:15.19]It's going to be better than that.
[128:20.81]Okay, looks good.
[128:21.84]Audio, we're going to have to have the sound.
[128:25.16]I mean, this is a music game, so the music is going to be up, right?
[128:28.50]Let me just change this.
[128:33.50]Part 2 is very hard.
[128:35.91]That's alright.
[128:38.15]See how long it takes me to fucking scream at this one.
[128:41.55]I don't want to be that guy, though.
[128:43.01]Am I, like, turning into that guy that's, like, the older, like, 30-plus YouTuber streamer that just is like, this guy, I'm not good at this.
[128:50.83]I don't like this.
[128:54.32]I don't like this game.
[128:56.86]Is that happening in real time here?
[129:02.20]God damn it.
[129:02.70]I'm going to work on that.
[129:09.26]I don't want to be, I don't want to turn into like the old boomer mutant guy.
[129:12.29]I don't want to do that.
[129:13.15]Alright, let me, this is not capturing for some reason.
[129:20.31]This is very soft.
[129:21.43]Alright, settings.
[129:25.11]Let me just stereo vibration off.
[129:27.47]Lyrics on screen mode, widescreen.
[129:31.99]Why is this so low?
[129:36.83]This is very quiet.
[129:39.51]I can't change the settings in here.
[129:40.60]Hold on.
[129:43.30]Really?
[129:43.94]I can't put the settings in?
[129:49.38]Hold on.
[129:50.94]Options.
[129:51.72]Play game.
[129:52.12]There's no... That's annoying.
[129:55.44]I'll at least let you see what I'm looking at.
[129:56.93]I'm going to have to reload the game and put the audio up.
[130:08.44]Because there doesn't seem to be an option here.
[130:11.22]There's like settings, but that doesn't sound stereo.
[130:13.82]There's no volume slider.
[130:15.60]The volume slider already... Hold on.
[130:16.86]I'm going to do this.
[130:23.94]Hopefully this works, otherwise... I'm not sure what the fix for that is.
[130:32.19]So this is a hard game?
[130:32.93]Isn't this like Parappa the Rapper?
[130:37.88]Alright.
[130:38.30]Audio.
[130:39.36]Sound effects.
[130:40.34]That's not that low.
[130:44.01]That's... normal.
[130:49.51]See if that does anything.
[130:55.53]Presented by SEGA.
[130:58.70]Uh... Okay, come on.
[131:02.66]Now it's very loud.
[131:04.40]Now it's extraordinarily loud.
[131:10.24]alright well uh I'm gonna hold on I'm almost at the sweet spot another like 10 down that's probably good that's probably the sweet spot
[131:35.37]Yeah, if you're just joining us and you don't know, I want to make sure I reiterate it because we had a little 10, 20 minutes in the beginning of the stream.
[131:42.36]Shirts are now available.
[131:43.86]There is a new shirt.
[131:45.82]And why don't we just put it on the screen because people are probably like, wait, what the heck's happening here?
[131:49.94]There is a new shirt and it is this.
[131:53.44]It is the Night Sky is the name of the shirt.
[132:00.76]It's currently available.
[132:02.26]It's beautiful.
[132:06.18]It is currently available on Teespring.
[132:08.84]Glue Man is also back.
[132:11.80]There's a command that's... Shirts, they're $20 each.
[132:20.31]I kind of told myself a long time ago that I didn't want to ever have, like, merchandise, especially t-shirts, be more than, like, $20 to $22, $23.
[132:25.35]So they're $20 each.
[132:30.83]Teespring Premium T. They're really comfortable.
[132:33.64]They're really nice.
[132:34.38]At least they were.
[132:35.14]I don't know.
[132:35.58]Hopefully they come out alright.
[132:38.52]But that is the shirt.
[132:39.94]The new one.
[132:42.30]Okay.
[132:43.70]Let's do Space Channel 5.
[132:49.53]Greedy streamer.
[132:50.45]Cheap streamer.
[132:55.77]No, you're kidding.
[132:58.14]$20 for one of those Teespring Premium shirts?
[133:02.81]Come on.
[133:05.85]I'm trying to keep him as reasonable as humanly possible.
[133:17.96]Alright.
[133:19.16]I think that's the sweet spot.
[133:20.04]Let's go.
[133:20.42]Play game.
[133:21.66]Story mode.
[133:22.36]Dance up a solo storm.
[133:23.32]Play as the Channel 5 reporter Ooh La La.
[133:25.80]Stop the fiendish schemes of the Rhythm and Rose.
[133:31.63]Okay.
[133:32.55]Changing room, that's... I don't have to, okay.
[133:35.55]Story, let's just do the story.
[133:36.31]Let's just see how we do it.
[133:40.01]Uh, back in action.
[133:40.99]Ooh la la, space symphony.
[133:42.17]A cruise ship soaring above Neo Pluto was attacked by a dance troupe.
[133:46.86]Oh no, this is bad.
[133:47.76]This is, like, you have to press, like, A, B, X, Y, A... I don't have that memorized.
[133:51.82]Remember the Red Dead?
[133:52.80]I need to plug in a PlayStation 4 controller.
[133:57.86]Why the fuck can't you see?
[134:07.86]You knew it was coming.
[134:08.52]Alright.
[134:19.09]Cool stream.
[134:19.67]Thanks!
[134:20.47]Hey, welcome to the stream!
[134:21.37]Alright, I'm gonna stop doing that.
[134:26.05]That's probably annoying.
[134:26.65]I was trying to match it.
[134:44.16]I hear the evil dance troupe.
[134:45.92]We have to beat them in a dance.
[134:50.66]Shit.
[134:51.28]I... I'm gonna be so bad at this with the Xbox controller.
[134:56.12]What is he doing?
[135:04.30]Makes them dance?
[135:06.88]What are you doing to all these Sims?
[135:27.01]8.30 AM.
[135:27.27]So this is the sub.
[135:29.22]This is not the dub.
[135:29.92]Is this going to be in Japanese?
[135:55.70]I think this might be in Japanese.
[135:58.28]Report number one.
[136:04.00]View rating.
[136:06.99]Uh, is she supposed to be invisible?
[136:24.38]Yeah, see, they're supposed to be invisible.
[136:31.12]Bad guy's unknown dance troupe.
[136:33.37]Where are the assets?
[136:35.93]If hearts run out, rescue fails.
[136:37.51]How am I supposed to do this without scenes?
[137:00.95]What was it?
[137:10.07]What the fuck?
[137:21.14]Okay, can you not do that please?
[137:22.82]Is this supposed to look like this?
[137:30.29]I thought this was just hyper-stylized, it's not supposed to look like this.
[137:38.65]Oh, I thought this was like a cool stylistic.
[137:44.94]Um.
[137:46.14]Okay, well.
[137:49.24]That's unfortunate.
[137:50.34]Let me just redo it?
[137:53.60]Let me go to the configuration and make sure I didn't activate something weird.
[137:58.58]This is just the graphics adapter.
[138:01.93]No, there's nothing abnormal here.
[138:11.29]You don't understand Japanese.
[138:12.69]You can't see the assets.
[138:16.47]This looks normal.
[138:17.15]Why would... That's weird.
[138:20.43]Why would some of the assets just not work?
[138:28.69]What the fuck is going on?
[138:32.15]Uh... Should I, like, verify the game cache?
[138:47.22]Okay, I'm gonna verify integrity of game files.
[138:49.32]Because... You're missing part one of the game.
[139:00.83]The menu is supposed to look like that.
[139:02.41]All files successfully validated.
[139:03.89]I think I'm just, it's just not rendering somehow.
[139:09.05]Turning off VSync works.
[139:10.79]I just turned it off.
[139:12.95]Maybe I'll choose like a different adapter.
[139:14.72]Maybe I'll choose like NVIDIA GGX number one or two.
[139:17.90]Let's try one.
[139:21.22]Because I don't know why there's three adapters here when I have one.
[139:24.84]Let me try like 1920 by 1080 at 60 hertz maybe.
[139:28.20]Instead of trying to do anything else.
[139:33.77]Let's just try 60 Hz.
[139:37.47]Alright.
[139:37.95]Vsync is off.
[139:39.19]Everything's off.
[139:40.15]Let's see if it does it on this adapter.
[139:44.25]Is this the... Yeah, this is the Steam version of this game.
[139:48.29]Hey, when are the shirts gonna be available?
[139:49.65]They are available right now.
[139:55.05]Um, I... Okay, so I figured out this is putting it on a different monitor.
[139:59.13]But that's not gonna help.
[140:00.45]That's just what that means.
[140:01.29]0, 1, and 2.
[140:01.99]Okay.
[140:05.41]I don't think this is going to do anything.
[140:10.93]Oh, it's still fucked up.
[140:13.84]Well, that was Space Channel 5 Part 2.
[140:16.70]For some reason, I don't... unless there's a... Turn down the resolution.
[140:24.40]I will try doing that.
[140:30.64]I'm going to turn off FXAA.
[140:35.31]The resolution is now at, let's just do, I don't know, 1400, 1600 by 900.
[140:43.81]See what that does.
[140:48.63]The menu is supposed to look like that.
[140:50.20]Oh, well, why does everybody tell me it wasn't?
[140:55.22]The menu is supposed to look like that.
[140:57.14]A bunch of people told me that was...
[141:06.66]Okay, let's try it again.
[141:08.63]I dropped the resolution, turned off V-sync.
[141:13.47]I will fix this if it works.
[141:16.83]Okay, I can just fix it right now, who cares?
[141:20.83]Hello, did it work?
[141:26.46]Come on.
[141:29.49]Uh, don't think it did.
[141:35.17]What the hell?
[141:36.03]So you're telling me that the reason why I didn't buy Space Channel 5 on the Dreamcast is because I know that they ported it to PC.
[141:52.21]And the port doesn't work.
[141:58.96]What?
[142:01.94]Well, uh, we'll maybe try that again later.
[142:05.36]But for the purposes, I'm gonna move on to a different one.
[142:07.10]Maybe I'll... We'll come back and try it again.
[142:12.16]Unfortunately, that's just kind of how it is.
[142:15.78]Turn Vsync is off.
[142:17.74]Everything is off.
[142:20.40]Alright, let's do, uh... Move on from that one.
[142:24.31]That's too bad.
[142:24.79]I wanted to play that for a while, too.
[142:27.07]So we have...
[142:29.84]Uh, we have knights what else is in the collection knights is in here Sonic adventure like dx, whatever the hell that is Sonic adventure dx this one.
[142:43.93]I was told to play the Dreamcast one jet set radio SEGA bass fishing.
[142:49.01]Let's do SEGA bass fishing.
[142:51.22]We got all night guys.
[142:52.10]Don't worry
[143:00.17]Alright, hopefully that doesn't happen to more than one of these.
[143:02.15]That would be kind of sad.
[143:03.89]Because, you know, that would be really unfortunate if percentage-wise, 700,000 games had more working titles than the Dreamcast collection on Windows.
[143:25.12]That would be very, very sad.
[143:29.06]Alright.
[143:29.92]Oh, we're good with audio.
[143:35.74]Let's go.
[143:36.66]I'm trying.
[143:38.70]What do you think I'm doing?
[143:44.52]Okay, here's this.
[143:45.28]Let's see if it works.
[143:54.43]Do we have assets?
[143:55.01]Oh, that's...
[144:01.76]That's, uh, the screen looks a little weird, so let's fix that.
[144:06.92]Good.
[144:09.94]SEGA.
[144:11.74]This is SEGA Bass Fishing.
[144:12.60]This is the original best fishing game ever made.
[144:16.29]According to some people.
[144:19.25]Okay, diary.
[144:22.51]Let's see.
[144:23.13]Sound.
[144:24.01]Sound sounds pretty good.
[144:27.37]Background music.
[144:28.49]Let's do a four, three.
[144:30.25]Let's see.
[144:35.23]Background music test.
[144:41.07]That's good.
[144:41.69]Sound effect test.
[144:45.71]That's good.
[144:50.24]Alright, fine, Jesus.
[144:59.05]Let's catch some fish, what do you say?
[145:04.09]Play game, arcade mode, original mode, arcade mode.
[145:06.99]Welcome to Lay Paradise, select an area.
[145:10.85]Cape Lodge.
[145:12.78]Lodge area, enjoy your fishing.
[145:15.42]I don't know how to play.
[145:17.29]Select the lure.
[145:18.55]Alright, reel and stop.
[145:20.65]Move lure.
[145:22.51]Move lure.
[145:23.67]Middle, deep.
[145:24.33]That's deep sea.
[145:25.07]Middle, shallow.
[145:27.29]Vibration.
[145:28.11]Pencil bait.
[145:28.87]Spinner bait.
[145:30.33]Let's just do shallow.
[145:31.21]Let's do something easy.
[145:32.01]They're all easy, except Mel.
[145:37.80]We'll do shallow and middle.
[145:38.84]Shallow crank.
[145:39.74]Select the casting point.
[145:57.96]Um, here's the one problem with what's going on right now.
[146:04.54]I have no idea how to play this.
[146:07.74]This just assumes I went up to the arcade and put a quarter in.
[146:12.28]Uh, I might have to figure out... I...
[146:25.54]Do I have to spin?
[146:29.31]I'm assuming the line tension has to be somewhere in the green.
[146:33.09]Is it left stick to spin around?
[146:35.31]Left trigger?
[146:35.83]I don't understand.
[146:50.36]I think we need to go to the controls menu.
[146:56.94]Hook rod control, move cast indicator, move selection, reeling fast.
[147:04.52]Lore selection, enter a mode area, cancel area selection, reeling slow, reeling normal.
[147:15.13]Okay, so reeling fast.
[147:19.55]This controller's made out of wood.
[147:24.32]So it's left trigger and right trigger and... How do I actually reel it in, though?
[147:29.96]Is that what I'm doing?
[147:33.34]Oh, he's... I have it.
[147:35.68]Nice!
[147:53.67]Okay, I just looked over, and somebody said, you're so bad.
[148:00.95]Listen, this is a game that's like 20 years old, that I have no idea what the controls are.
[148:08.50]I just opened it five minutes ago.
[148:13.70]What?
[148:13.90]I don't even know how to reel the fish in yet.
[148:24.04]How can- how is that possible?
[148:25.64]So that's slow.
[148:39.11]Alright, let's try it again.
[148:42.93]You wanted a quarter from me, okay.
[148:50.74]Can I turn the boat?
[148:55.39]How do I... Okay, I'm trying every direction.
[148:58.04]I can't, like, move.
[148:58.84]Uh...
[149:22.84]Alright, I gotta really slow, keep it, like, in the yellow.
[149:28.68]Okay.
[149:29.42]I get it.
[149:30.72]How do I- I can't turn the boat around?
[149:34.18]So there's no- I have to do it here.
[149:39.47]This is the only way.
[149:40.23]I can't turn, I can't move, I can't pull the rod in, I just have to cast somewhere, like, in front of the dock.
[149:45.33]And it has to be shallow.
[149:47.77]Let's get it.
[149:54.67]That's a huge one.
[149:59.13]Come on.
[150:07.50]Whoa, easy, easy, easy.
[150:09.12]What?
[150:09.36]Let it up, let it up, let it up.
[150:14.33]How do I let up?
[150:15.83]Ooh, he's a big boy.
[150:22.91]Come on.
[150:25.24]Come on, I almost got him!
[150:28.40]Get over here!
[150:30.28]No, don't break the line!
[150:31.52]He's gonna be, like, 300 pounds.
[150:32.90]Get him!
[150:33.20]Get him!
[150:35.25]Pull him up!
[150:35.83]Yes!
[150:53.20]How much is that one?
[150:56.25]Nine pounds?
[150:57.19]Pretty good.
[151:01.21]I did it.
[151:03.77]I beat the game.
[151:05.05]So, alright.
[151:07.58]What was with the fire alarm sound?
[151:10.36]Alright, let's do normal.
[151:12.46]Twitch rod.
[151:13.18]It means the twitch.tv one.
[151:15.26]Reel consistently.
[151:17.02]Move rod to make lure shake.
[151:21.49]We have to do the Twitch one.
[151:22.37]So this is shallow and middle.
[151:24.15]How about, like, here?
[151:30.40]This is a Twitch rod.
[151:32.00]You gotta, like, Twitch.
[151:35.84]Got it.
[151:37.34]Whoa!
[151:39.68]Slow it down.
[151:42.70]Just consistently reel it in.
[151:43.76]Don't freak out.
[151:44.61]This is another huge one.
[151:45.37]I am right.
[151:53.30]Get in here.
[151:53.82]Whoa!
[151:58.59]What?
[152:00.43]I'm trying to lower it.
[152:02.05]I gotta get you before the time runs out.
[152:03.73]Come on.
[152:06.09]Get up here.
[152:06.77]Oh, he's fighting me so much I can't hold him.
[152:12.03]Get it!
[152:14.59]Yeah, I put another coin in.
[152:23.31]That was a quarter to see what I caught.
[152:28.39]Special, uh, popper.
[152:30.11]Let's change the rod.
[152:34.99]Let's go deep.
[152:37.88]Reel and stop.
[152:38.56]Let's go trick, let's get a deep fish.
[152:41.42]Let's see here.
[152:43.44]There's a big one right here.
[152:44.38]Let's sink to the bottom.
[152:53.18]Come on.
[152:53.82]He's like a catfish.
[152:58.39]Come on.
[152:59.89]Nobody wants this?
[153:07.61]He does.
[153:09.85]No, I'm like, it's reeled up again.
[153:13.09]I can't put it, how do you put it down?
[153:14.31]I'm trying to push it down.
[153:15.15]No, too close.
[153:22.72]Try that again.
[153:25.06]Come on!
[153:25.76]There's a big one that's- there you go.
[153:33.31]Come on!
[153:59.11]Oh, he's too big.
[154:00.07]I'm not gonna get this in 45 seconds, no way.
[154:09.99]Get over here.
[154:10.61]No, don't break!
[154:12.09]Let go, let go, let go, let go.
[154:15.18]Let go, let go, let go!
[154:16.80]Let go!
[154:25.00]I am lowering the rod.
[154:26.14]It's too big.
[154:28.20]I have to put another quarter in.
[154:31.24]Get over here.
[154:32.38]No!
[154:33.68]Don't break it!
[154:36.78]Okay.
[154:37.04]I got...
[154:49.63]I beat it.
[154:49.97]I had to have beat the area.
[154:51.51]I think it's 18 pounds?
[154:53.45]19 pounds?
[154:53.89]23 pounds.
[154:54.21]I have one second.
[154:55.37]I have zero seconds, don't I?
[154:57.07]See, here's the thing that's unfair about this arcade game.
[155:00.65]Why... You can have the timer go when I'm selecting a rod.
[155:19.12]And why am I fishing like a nuclear power plant?
[155:22.64]I'm gonna roll consistently, right?
[155:48.05]Get it!
[155:49.55]He wants it!
[155:50.09]Come on, pick it up!
[155:51.75]Somebody get it!
[155:58.59]Got it!
[156:02.17]This one's little, but... I got it.
[156:09.35]Not that big.
[156:09.99]One second remaining, it's okay.
[156:11.45]I need to get a huge one.
[156:17.61]Ah, change the lore.
[156:19.35]I want a D. Reel and stop.
[156:22.72]Yeah, here's a coin.
[156:25.82]Captain Falcon.
[156:26.46]That was literally, that was actually Captain Falcon.
[156:28.82]That, like, come on!
[156:30.72]Move lore.
[156:31.16]Move and reel and stop.
[156:32.08]We'll do this one.
[156:49.53]Nah, he looks pretty big, but I don't know if you're big enough for me to want.
[156:53.56]He looks pretty average.
[156:55.64]And you're left.
[156:56.66]Almost got it.
[156:59.82]Come on.
[157:18.76]Not big enough.
[157:23.62]Where are the big ones?
[157:27.30]Okay, let's try over here.
[157:29.36]That looks like a big silhouette.
[157:30.94]That's a huge one down here.
[157:32.16]Come on, get it!
[157:33.02]You're so huge, do it!
[157:44.26]Oh, this is going to be a big one.
[157:50.96]Listen to him.
[157:52.84]You hear that?
[157:54.36]Slow it down.
[157:54.78]Got it.
[157:57.06]Take it out.
[158:08.67]That's definitely at least 20 pounds.
[158:10.03]Ooh, 10 pounds.
[158:13.92]More than that.
[158:16.64]16 pounds.
[158:17.52]I beat them all.
[158:21.36]What is the next area?
[158:24.83]The secret palace.
[158:27.43]Okay.
[158:28.47]This is the end.
[158:29.15]Where's the special lore?
[158:33.15]Move rod to make a pop sound.
[158:34.71]Are they like zombie fish?
[158:40.39]Floating minnow.
[158:41.11]Twitch rod and reel.
[158:46.58]We'll go with, uh... This is just the top, though.
[158:52.45]If I real consistently, constantly... Yeah, I'll try it with this one.
[158:55.29]Yeah, look at her ghost pass.
[159:00.73]Nobody on the steps?
[159:08.81]Come on.
[159:09.27]Okay, that actually kind of scared me a little.
[159:10.73]I was like, why is there a person down here?
[159:12.21]Okay.
[159:21.75]No fish.
[159:25.13]I can look for like silhouettes in the water.
[159:31.37]Anarpondo.
[159:35.18]Let's try over here.
[159:35.94]Could be around under this bridge where the fire is.
[159:41.50]Let's try it.
[159:44.92]There's probably not very many fish in here.
[159:48.16]It's a secret area.
[159:59.20]Speaking of big fish, there's one right here.
[160:00.96]Big one.
[160:01.46]Come on.
[160:02.96]Get it.
[160:06.47]A big one's close by.
[160:07.59]He can't go.
[160:08.37]His mouth is not... Look out!
[160:11.09]Fish!
[160:18.70]No Ghostfish, unfortunately.
[160:20.04]I gotta reel this consistently, right?
[160:26.32]Let up, let up, let up, let up, let up, let up!
[160:28.74]I can't let it up.
[160:37.40]He's got a long way to go.
[160:46.69]The rod is as right as I can make it go.
[160:49.83]You can do it.
[160:51.82]Into the boat with you.
[160:53.16]This one is gigantic.
[160:56.40]How big?
[160:56.64]19? 20?
[161:12.34]Is this Christopher Walken?
[161:13.44]That's a pretty good Walken.
[161:14.62]Got an A?
[161:15.22]That's pretty good.
[161:16.34]Let's see.
[161:16.56]Who cares?
[161:46.33]Master Ranking.
[161:52.61]That was a fun game to waste $4 at at the arcade.
[161:58.83]Does that announce any other secret areas or anything to do?
[162:03.57]This time I'm not going to skip the credits.
[162:22.57]This game is a lot shorter than I thought it was.
[162:27.15]But it is an arcade game, so it makes sense.
[162:31.63]DC Staff?
[162:37.51]Which one of these fish is from the DC universe?
[162:50.12]But I can't even skip it, actually, so... We have to sit here and watch it.
[162:58.93]Presented by SEGA.
[162:59.71]1997.
[162:59.73]1999.
[163:00.01]This is 20 years old.
[163:08.66]This has probably been out of the arcades for like 22 or 23 years.
[163:14.36]Thank you for playing.
[163:17.74]Thank you.
[163:19.28]You're welcome.
[163:25.09]This game is older than Fortnite.
[163:26.85]Game over.
[163:31.35]Yeah, I guess it is.
[163:32.05]Alright, hold on.
[163:32.60]Play game, original mode, practice mode, original mode.
[163:35.16]Let's just see.
[163:36.72]New game.
[163:37.20]What is there?
[163:39.38]You can select your fisher somehow.
[163:43.85]Please enter your name.
[163:51.94]This is an amateur tournament.
[163:53.22]I guess it's just a little different.
[163:54.86]Tournament because it's a five-state opl... whatever.
[164:00.56]Right in front of the car.
[164:08.94]Oops.
[164:13.86]So there's not much of a difference.
[164:14.84]It's just a tournament.
[164:16.00]No, I don't want the little one.
[164:21.23]In the big one.
[164:22.11]Big.
[164:24.57]Come here.
[164:29.51]No!
[164:30.79]There's an even bigger one right here.
[164:33.10]Get over here.
[164:34.18]That's fine.
[164:34.58]I got an A. I got an A.
[164:50.30]Also, I missed 50 bucks from, it was a $5,000 donation from Juno.
[165:00.71]I was so glued and my brain was only focusing on Crazy Taxi.
[165:05.25]Thank you so much for the 50 bucks.
[165:07.83]They say, thanks for the ride, Jeremiah.
[165:08.81]I appreciate how you ran over 46 people and crashed into 14 cars, but I didn't appreciate when you yelled, get out of my car at me the moment we arrived at my stop.
[165:19.44]Thank you.
[165:22.41]Did I get you there on time?
[165:23.99]The answer is yes.
[165:26.75]Thank you for the $50.
[165:27.33]Did we just get Sonic DX out of the way?
[165:34.74]Sonic Adventure DX.
[165:35.74]This game is terrible, right?
[165:37.02]This is like an awful, terrible dog shit game, right?
[165:41.06]Am I wrong?
[165:45.78]No, wait, which one is bad?
[165:48.96]Isn't there a really bad one?
[165:51.48]This one is the good one.
[165:57.42]Oh, okay.
[165:58.89]06.
[165:58.99]Right.
[165:59.23]Alright.
[165:59.75]Hold on.
[166:00.21]Let me rephrase that.
[166:01.03]Let me go ahead and just make sure I clear the air here.
[166:04.35]That's the one I was talking about.
[166:06.57]I thought this was Sonic Adventure 06.
[166:10.02]I didn't know.
[166:10.90]I'm sorry.
[166:12.02]I did not.
[166:12.36]I wasn't aware of what I was saying.
[166:13.70]Let's play Sonic Adventure DX.
[166:21.98]I thought it was 06.
[166:24.20]Let's give it a try.
[166:24.77]This is where all the theme songs came from, didn't it?
[166:28.07]This is like the original, we have rock music on every Sonic game, right?
[166:31.75]Alright, turn the audio down a little.
[166:44.98]Let's see how that is.
[166:49.86]3D Sonic has no flow and ages like milk.
[166:51.91]I didn't say it.
[166:52.41]Somebody in chat did.
[166:57.59]Are we going to do a full playthrough?
[166:59.21]I don't know.
[167:02.72]I did a full playthrough of Crazy Taxi.
[167:05.12]Got S ranking.
[167:05.88]That's all you need.
[167:11.10]How long is the game?
[167:23.30]And you guys get mad if I press start and skip the opening cutscene?
[167:30.36]Where's Sonic from?
[167:36.25]That was so loud, I'm sorry.
[167:44.55]This is so fucking loud.
[167:49.19]I turned it down, dude.
[167:57.33]I don't care, I'm sorry
[168:23.73]I'm sorry, guys.
[168:25.49]Until I can get that fucking figured out.
[168:28.11]I'm gonna piss my pants, too.
[168:29.82]We're gonna do a window pee break.
[168:32.10]I'll be right back.
[168:38.26]Pee break.
[171:51.66]this is loud okay hello I need to actually go back because I don't think I can yeah I got a vibration off yeah I got to go back and turn it all down again
[172:18.50]So I'm gonna put the lyrics on and we're gonna sing it.
[172:21.16]Each one of these songs.
[172:21.92]Okay, background music, put it like down here, down here, let's see how that works.
[172:42.67]Here, let's try it again.
[172:47.52]Simulated widescreen, not cool.
[172:50.48]That's better.
[172:54.90]I turned it so far down.
[172:56.83]What the fuck?
[172:58.75]How far do I have to turn this thing down?
[173:07.59]How does it even happen?
[173:09.70]I don't think it did anything.
[173:19.20]Whatever.
[173:19.46]I was gonna go into my actual audio.
[173:24.12]No, it doesn't matter.
[173:27.54]Absolute bullshit.
[173:28.44]Hold on.
[173:30.42]Let's see if that helps.
[173:34.81]It does a little.
[173:35.33]A little more.
[173:46.39]Oh, look!
[173:46.80]Bearable!
[173:48.92]Who do you want to play as?
[173:49.90]Alright, we got Amy, Big, E, 102, Y. I can only be Sonic.
[173:54.56]Instruction.
[173:55.56]I'm going to figure out how to play the game.
[174:02.47]I have no idea what's going on.
[174:06.59]Rotate camera.
[174:07.85]X and V is spin dash.
[174:09.07]A is jump attack.
[174:09.80]Maneuver character.
[174:10.58]Yeah, I know how to do that.
[174:11.56]Hold on.
[174:11.82]I don't want this to get loud.
[174:16.35]Alright, A is jump, spin.
[174:19.05]Press A in mid-jump, homing attack directed at the nearest enemy, yeah.
[174:22.91]Other actions, pick up, click down, yep.
[174:25.37]Throw, shake, press and hold, X, E, B. Press and hold X and shake it around.
[174:31.05]You stomp on the plunger.
[174:32.55]Well, sometimes an object other than a capsule is used, sure.
[174:38.39]Let's go.
[174:52.34]Mario Odyssey, this is that level.
[174:54.87]The new Jump City, what's it called?
[175:10.18]Oh yeah!
[175:11.14]With subtitles.
[175:11.97]This is happening!
[175:20.43]You shouldn't have punched, like, three pedestrians.
[175:22.93]What's up?
[175:23.75]And, like, drove into a wall.
[175:25.00]Now you got, like, two stars.
[175:34.62]Uh, it's a monster.
[175:37.68]It's a thing you're a monster in.
[175:38.68]EDF.
[175:38.86]It's the Earth Defense Force.
[175:50.96]Lock on target, men!
[175:51.42]Ready?
[175:51.54]Fire!
[175:51.76]What?
[175:51.88]Oh no!
[175:52.04]Our weapons are useless!
[175:53.83]Retreat!
[175:54.23]All personnel, fall back!
[175:56.95]Retreat!
[175:58.55]All personnel, fall back!
[176:03.33]Retreat!
[176:03.59]All personnel, fall back!
[176:04.39]Retreat!
[176:04.59]All personnel, fall back!
[176:05.35]Retreat!
[176:05.53]All personnel, fall back!
[176:06.13]Retreat!
[176:06.29]All personnel, fall back!
[176:06.97]Retreat!
[176:07.27]All personnel, fall back!
[176:11.03]They had already shot him.
[176:12.39]Aw yeah!
[176:13.27]This could be fun!
[176:14.09]So this is the original Sonic Adventure.
[176:23.94]What did this come after?
[176:25.04]Sonic, uh, Sonic Boom?
[176:26.72]No.
[176:26.86]He got us a zero.
[176:27.96]Sonic, uh, Sonic 3?
[176:30.53]Get all the rings.
[176:32.03]Oh, okay, she's gone.
[176:33.33]She's gone.
[176:59.57]Got hit on the tutorial room.
[177:02.14]What a joke.
[177:08.82]Two rings.
[177:09.60]Yeah, you don't collect all the rings, right?
[177:11.04]It's not like coins.
[177:11.78]I haven't played Sonic in a long time.
[177:15.80]The last game I played in Sonic was Sonic Unleashed and I cried.
[177:20.21]Because I spent a bunch of money on it.
[177:22.05]And I played it for like four hours and I cried because I didn't have any money left.
[177:41.41]You know nothing, fool!
[177:43.54]It's Chaos, the God of Destruction!
[177:53.58]I want to sip Chaos.
[177:55.20]Would you rake him?
[177:57.36]What would happen?
[177:59.96]Huh?
[178:10.32]Didn't they try to bring Sonic into a new generation?
[178:13.28]To get everyone more involved and care more about Sonic.
[178:16.14]They increased his leg length by like 8%.
[178:19.92]He has longer legs now.
[178:21.54]And there's that movie coming out too.
[178:24.66]Oh, hi.
[178:38.09]So it's... the bumper is just the camera, which is a little odd.
[178:43.71]First ever open world... ever.
[178:46.17]Want to see these?
[178:53.76]From now on, the casino is only open at night.
[178:55.60]Is there a casino in this game?
[178:56.80]How did I not know that?
[179:02.63]Don't talk about that travesty.
[179:07.66]Well, what did I do?
[179:08.36]That's correct.
[179:09.42]I know it is.
[179:11.14]I fucking knew it.
[179:12.20]How did I know that?
[179:13.88]What just happened?
[179:49.08]I'm not kidding.
[179:49.82]I think this may have been on, like, a playlist I had.
[179:57.66]It was on a playlist.
[179:59.26]I remember listening to this song and thinking it was awesome.
[180:12.49]I don't know why.
[180:19.74]No, this is the good one.
[180:20.58]I remember this one being fairly decent.
[180:23.72]If it was good enough for me to put it on a playlist.
[180:25.42]What the fuck just happened?
[180:27.88]Never mind!
[180:28.38]Did I fall through the Earth?
[180:43.55]That's the whale.
[180:57.28]Remember in 2001?
[180:57.76]The original PogChamp?
[181:00.26]We're in absolute- I don't know, it doesn't matter.
[181:12.88]I missed the thing.
[181:13.96]It's okay.
[181:28.00]It's the only song that was on my playlist, if you're curious.
[181:32.87]I didn't put any of the others, nothing else on here.
[181:36.19]I'm just going to do the first one.
[181:40.89]Are the characters more annoying, Sonic or Naruto?
[181:45.80]Uh... Am I supposed to kill that guy?
[181:54.24]I've never seen Naruto, so I have no idea.
[182:04.44]The only thing I know about Naruto is, just like Bart Simpson, Naruto is voiced by a 75-year-old lady.
[182:12.64]That's all I know.
[182:17.04]I don't know anything else.
[182:22.52]What?
[182:22.76]Oh.
[182:38.02]Wait a minute, I get these.
[182:41.26]Dude, I'm like seriously, like nostalgia is so cool.
[182:55.21]Throw it as big as soon as possible.
[183:03.37]Well, I need to play as turn down the volume.
[183:14.96]Yeah, not bad.
[183:16.26]See.
[183:25.45]Hey, Sonic.
[183:26.49]Long time no see, huh?
[183:29.05]I'm just glad you're okay.
[183:32.53]Same time.
[183:33.33]What happened anyway?
[183:34.79]You're too good of a pilot to just crash like that.
[183:37.23]No, no, that's embarrassing.
[183:39.44]That was a test run using a new prototype propulsion system.
[183:42.24]It's got a few bugs to iron out.
[183:43.50]This is just a Fullmetal Alchemist actress.
[183:45.52]Why not just use my plane, the Tornado?
[183:47.61]Convince me otherwise.
[183:48.95]Thanks, but you gotta check out my newest power supply.
[183:52.25]Ta-da!
[183:57.12]Whoa!
[183:58.56]A Chaos Emerald!
[184:00.98]Yep.
[184:01.74]I just happened to find one of the seven emeralds during one of my test fights.
[184:04.96]That's Alphonse and Edward.
[184:06.18]This thing's got unlimited power, you know.
[184:08.66]So I figured, why not use it to power my plane?
[184:11.91]Supercharged!
[184:15.29]You've gotta come over to my workshop, Sonic.
[184:18.05]I've got something I've gotta show you.
[184:19.57]Tails, that's not a toy.
[184:21.29]It's in the Mystic Ruins.
[184:22.91]The fastest way is by train.
[184:24.67]Let's go!
[184:25.99]Somebody will be
[184:33.40]Now you can play with Tails!
[184:35.18]Alright, where's that bucket of shade off?
[184:40.64]Only available at night.
[184:42.08]When does it become night?
[184:47.98]So now can I- how do I choose Tails?
[184:50.08]Can I be Tails now?
[184:50.96]What does this say?
[185:01.21]Welcome to Emerald Coast!
[185:05.39]He wants so bad to go to the casino.
[185:08.42]I just want to play Sonic Blackjack.
[185:12.36]That's all I want to do.
[185:22.18]Take the train to the Mystic Ruins.
[185:24.16]Take the train to the Mystic Ruins.
[185:25.92]Okay, well, where's the train?
[185:30.09]The train headed for the Mystic Ruins will be departing soon.
[185:33.41]Okay.
[185:35.03]Where's the train that goes into the casino?
[185:55.98]What an awful camera.
[186:00.40]I mean, I can't really think of a worse camera than this game.
[186:06.77]tails workshop should be around here somewhere Mario 64. if it isn't Sonic he's not wearing clothes I just realized that look it's a giant talking egg silence I thought Sonic got shorts on the pants the greatest scientific genius in the world
[186:34.50]Whatever you say, Eggman!
[186:35.92]Imagine running around naked, 150 miles per hour, with two men.
[186:39.13]And now, I'm gonna put them to work!
[186:40.59]That would not be comfortable.
[186:42.37]You're always up to no good.
[186:44.29]Now what do you want?
[186:45.29]I want all of the Chaos Emeralds!
[186:48.33]Better not interfere!
[186:49.99]Or else!
[186:52.31]Or else what, you big loser?
[186:55.82]Or else I'll take them from you by force!
[186:58.48]The hard way!
[187:02.60]Hit him three times.
[187:12.06]There's something about Eggman that's really weird.
[187:14.54]He always uses this same ship every game.
[187:18.06]He makes another one.
[187:21.04]Eggman, can you just make something out that's not the little circle spaceship thing that I hit three times?
[187:30.00]No!
[187:30.91]Well, it worked.
[187:42.68]I think I have to jump on the... I'm assuming homing dash on the missiles would be what I would do.
[187:53.22]Gotta run real fast, dash, and just land on top of it.
[188:12.62]All systems, full power!
[188:16.66]He's not gonna get away with this!
[188:30.33]That was close.
[188:32.27]This is gonna make me sick.
[188:33.39]I'm sorry, it is.
[188:35.55]All systems, full power!
[188:37.19]No, you hit me three times!
[188:40.63]No!
[188:42.42]I should hit the track tomorrow.
[188:43.32]It takes to kill me.
[188:46.88]Hey, I'll play with you some other time.
[188:54.75]Who's the engineer making these?
[188:55.85]Like, you gotta have a conversation with whoever's on your dev team.
[189:01.57]Can we have a device that's not going to take three bumps and explode?
[189:05.81]There has to be a way.
[189:06.93]I don't know what you're using for materials, but there has to be something you can do.
[189:09.71]Well, that wasn't so hard.
[189:14.98]Nice job, Tail.
[189:22.95]You brought that out there to give it to him.
[189:25.81]Why are you still holding that intent?
[189:30.22]You were delivering that to him.
[189:35.22]Oh no, isn't that the same monster I saw the other day?
[189:46.77]Oh, yes.
[189:48.08]It's just as the stone tablets predicted.
[189:50.38]This is the original Infinity War.
[189:55.06]His strength increases every time I feed him a Chaos Emerald.
[189:59.34]That's really true.
[190:00.14]With all seven Emeralds in him, he'll be invincible and work for me.
[190:06.01]Isn't Dragon Ball the original Infinity Stones, though?
[190:11.13]Yeah, no, Sonic the Hedgehog is just a direct copy of Dragon Ball.
[190:17.28]Isn't that what the owners said?
[190:19.84]Isn't that what they did?
[190:22.06]They made their own version of Dragon Ball because they loved Dragon Ball so much?
[190:24.78]That's what this is, right?
[190:29.80]Sonic!
[190:30.64]We can't let him get away with this, can we?
[190:33.27]No way, Tails!
[190:35.39]Without more emeralds, the monster can't transform.
[190:38.20]So, it's up to us to get the emeralds before Eggman does, huh?
[190:43.54]That's why he goes Super Saiyan.
[190:45.02]He turns into, like, yellow-haired Supersonic.
[190:47.30]What, you think they just made that up?
[191:01.37]I mean, yeah, that is a perfect copy.
[191:08.56]The Nice Neva- Nice Nevada Theory.
[191:12.11]I almost fucked it up.
[191:12.99]I almost said it wrong.
[191:22.02]Can I go in here?
[191:22.62]Who's in here?
[191:24.48]It's Tails Workshop.
[191:27.84]Nothing fun can be done in there.
[191:44.92]I wasn't supposed to go that way.
[191:45.74]Okay.
[191:45.98]Alright, let's go to, uh, the next area.
[191:51.20]Let's have the little, uh, fairy spin.
[191:58.67]Wait, what?
[191:59.79]I'm gonna go back to Tails' workshop.
[192:10.09]Why?
[192:13.20]I get the gem?
[192:13.82]I don't have- I-
[192:17.50]Did I not save the game?
[192:23.12]They go in the... They have the key in front of his workshop.
[192:25.59]Alright.
[192:46.51]Is that key gone?
[192:47.91]Okay.
[192:48.77]Looks like a key.
[192:53.63]Alright.
[192:57.43]Well, Tails, where do I put your new... Where do you want to put your, like, 8th grade science fair trophy?
[193:01.99]Over there?
[193:21.82]Put it off the cliff.
[193:32.67]Down?
[193:34.53]That's just water.
[193:36.13]Throw it.
[193:36.64]No, no, no.
[193:37.12]I'm not gonna throw it off the edge.
[193:53.29]I can't just jump in and fall down in there?
[193:56.96]Go in the cave, okay.
[193:58.24]The cave was over here, right?
[194:20.34]Cave near train.
[194:21.34]This is when I get to not paying attention to the cutscene.
[194:24.28]We were just talking about nonsense.
[194:26.10]Cave... in front of the... Okay.
[194:45.62]And I'll go in.
[194:55.73]Alright, let's get a Chaos Emerald.
[195:05.04]What the hell was that?
[195:05.98]Why did it stop me?
[195:09.08]It just... it just stopped me.
[195:10.93]I just... I was like a cinder block.
[195:12.93]What the hell was that?
[195:15.59]I didn't even bounce up like this.
[195:37.26]What happened there?
[195:37.80]What?
[195:37.94]That wasn't far enough.
[195:46.00]I need to get some... I have no lives left.
[195:49.05]We'll just walk through this, right?
[195:55.69]Is it 100 rings?
[196:06.99]Am I dead?
[196:10.71]No.
[196:13.59]What?
[196:14.39]Oh.
[196:15.61]Head straight up.
[196:16.67]You should be able to get out of the tornado.
[196:18.51]Is that a time limit or something?
[196:21.59]This looks like it has a time limit.
[196:22.77]Jump on panel number one.
[196:24.11]It will take you to panels two and three.
[196:27.33]Jump as soon as you land on a panel or else you'll fall.
[196:31.75]One more.
[196:32.25]Two more.
[196:32.57]Looks good.
[196:46.43]This is wild.
[196:47.01]Alright, where do I go from here?
[196:48.21]Sprite.
[196:54.58]Almost had another, uh... I was gonna say High Five.
[197:00.74]That's not correct.
[197:16.06]No, don't jump over.
[197:16.90]What is this?
[197:18.60]Okay.
[197:18.82]Got it.
[197:19.12]What's the official speedrun for this game?
[197:31.85]I feel like a Sonic the Hedgehog would be great to have a speedrun on.
[197:40.28]40 rings.
[197:40.80]Nice.
[197:52.38]Jesus.
[197:53.00]Where am I?
[197:53.42]Oh my god.
[197:56.65]This level's cold.
[198:07.70]Cold Left Stick Up Simulator.
[198:09.88]Yeah, but it doesn't mean it's not fun.
[198:12.18]Because right now I'm pretending that I'm him running.
[198:15.62]And it's really, really fun.
[198:24.07]What's that Marbles game?
[198:27.05]This is the Marbles.
[198:28.35]Marbles with friends, right?
[198:40.14]Wait, there's a streamer that actually likes the song?
[198:42.99]Do most people hate this game?
[198:44.01]Did they do?
[198:53.45]The train headed for Station Square will be departing soon.
[198:58.85]Yeah, I mean, the thing came out like 20 years ago.
[199:03.75]It's hard to hate something that came out this long ago, even though maybe it's a little... I don't know.
[199:08.94]I don't really have an opinion.
[199:11.30]I need to go back to the train.
[199:12.18]Go to Station Square.
[199:13.60]You may find something.
[199:32.21]Oh, casino time.
[199:37.77]I mean, don't worry.
[199:38.29]Right now I'm saying, yeah, this is kind of cool.
[199:39.75]It's fun.
[199:40.27]It's old, but it's interesting.
[199:41.59]And, like, don't worry.
[199:42.16]Give it, like, another 30 minutes.
[199:42.98]I'm going to tell you how this is the worst game I've ever played.
[199:45.60]There's a place somewhere in the city where you can go down into the sewer.
[199:50.70]Just give it, like, 30 minutes and you'll hear me.
[199:54.34]Alright, this is Twinkle Park.
[199:57.73]No.
[199:58.43]Alright, casino.
[199:59.21]Is it over here?
[200:09.13]This is it, right?
[200:10.21]No?
[200:13.27]The scene is only open at night.
[200:14.63]How do I get in?
[200:15.31]Is it not technically nighttime?
[200:28.12]Three rings?
[200:40.67]Is it gone?
[200:41.55]Okay.
[200:42.23]I need to play more fishing levels.
[200:46.37]Oh, it opens the door.
[200:48.03]Okay.
[200:55.20]Uh.
[200:58.04]Whatever.
[201:02.81]Alright.
[201:03.39]Sewer.
[201:03.63]If I was a sewer, where would I be?
[201:09.83]Probably not this way.
[201:14.05]No.
[201:14.19]Somewhere on the street.
[201:15.31]Out here.
[201:17.86]Out of the way.
[201:20.64]Remember our manhole cover?
[201:37.01]Looks like a sewer to me Super soon.
[201:46.64]What is it?
[201:52.53]Now you've got light speed shoes.
[201:55.01]Press and hold the action button to store up power.
[201:58.20]Once you have enough power, release the button and you can do the light speed dash.
[202:02.82]The light speed dash lets you race toward rings at light speed.
[202:06.61]As long as there's a trail of rings, you can go just about anywhere.
[202:09.93]Well, that solved the thing I was just trying to do.
[202:19.55]Use the light dash to run along the paths of rings.
[202:23.07]Hold the action button and let go when you have enough power.
[202:27.45]Uh, okay.
[202:30.79]Do I have enough power?
[202:31.55]You have to actually hold it for a while.
[202:38.80]Why doesn't it have a key?
[202:47.94]Alright, now I can go back and go in that room.
[202:50.46]Egg?
[202:50.88]What do you mean, egg?
[202:55.47]What?
[202:55.65]I can pick... I can pick that up?
[202:58.57]Who the hell was that?
[203:15.71]How do I get in that?
[203:16.48]Where was that room?
[203:17.32]Where was that?
[203:25.86]Pick this up?
[203:26.66]I'm not sure I can steal this.
[203:30.81]I can't steal it.
[203:45.33]Can I put a robot there instead?
[203:49.37]I can't place that one.
[204:01.41]Pick up a guy?
[204:02.77]Hey, don't use the back door.
[204:09.17]I can't get it.
[204:18.33]Put egg back.
[204:19.53]Get egg.
[204:20.31]Put egg back.
[204:22.99]Get egg!
[204:30.37]Alright, now I gotta go to... back to the casino.
[204:33.39]Oh!
[204:33.65]Casino.
[204:34.01]It's my time.
[204:35.43]Who gives a shit about anything else?
[204:47.90]The train headed for the Mystic Ruins will be departing soon.
[204:51.52]Cool.
[204:52.38]Alright.
[204:52.86]Where's the slot machine?
[204:53.62]Where's the poker table?
[204:59.84]Do I have one?
[205:06.53]Casino 10.
[205:08.09]Casino.
[205:10.15]Casino.
[205:10.79]Casinopolis is open, but the only way in is to...
[205:22.64]The music is way too loud.
[205:24.02]I wish... There's no solution.
[205:30.60]There's no casino open.
[205:33.50]So I'm just gonna go into that room and dash across.
[205:36.58]What the fank?
[205:40.26]Let me go back.
[205:41.86]Press the button?
[205:42.62]Press the button?
[205:44.94]I thought that they said I can't go in the front door.
[206:01.09]Okay.
[206:01.33]Alright, this camera is seriously starting to piss me off.
[206:05.67]I can't even turn the fucking thing around.
[206:08.09]Alright, let's go.
[206:10.95]Get the Chaos Emblem from the Casino Walkers.
[206:23.12]Throw your rings in the vault.
[206:26.56]Just try to save at least 400 rings.
[206:30.34]Ooh, I like this level.
[206:35.80]Slot pinball course ahead.
[206:37.84]Use L1 and R when you move the flippers.
[206:39.57]Match three pictures in a row and shoot the ball towards the arrow.
[206:42.05]If it's dumped in the garage, you don't have 100 rings.
[206:47.49]Shit, I don't have any money.
[206:51.19]Deposit your rings.
[207:01.14]I can't activate any of these?
[207:04.61]Alright, well, hold on.
[207:07.75]If it's that loud, I can't... Like, blame SEGA for having a 5,000 decibel game that they didn't fix.
[207:17.47]And it doesn't matter.
[207:19.11]I just turned down my audio on Windows.
[207:23.07]Like, my desktop Windows audio to 15%.
[207:24.99]Listen to this.
[207:26.73]Listen to this shit.
[207:31.07]Let's open up Sonic.
[207:31.79]Alright, I have to drop it in three different places now.
[207:45.18]Because now I can't hear anything.
[207:57.16]How's that?
[208:00.61]Turn the sound down in the game options.
[208:02.01]Well, the funny thing about that is I have to exit the game and restart the game to do that.
[208:05.36]And I did it three times pretty much already.
[208:08.08]So I really don't want to exit the game to turn the sound down.
[208:16.75]Alright.
[208:19.31]So what do I go from here?
[208:23.71]Cards?
[208:24.01]Is this card pinball?
[208:25.49]So I can't do any of this.
[208:30.56]You missed three times.
[208:31.40]However, if you have less than a hundred rings, you could dump them in the garage.
[208:37.91]So, I don't know.
[208:38.55]I'm just gonna get dumped in the garage.
[208:40.93]Unless there's, like, a stack of money somewhere.
[208:46.77]Shower room.
[208:51.60]Well, I'm robbing the casino.
[208:56.06]Apparently.
[209:01.67]I'm just punching machines.
[209:03.03]That's... That's not okay.
[209:07.43]You can wash yourself off.
[209:40.25]Any more?
[209:47.71]You know, it's not the video game that's gonna make me turn this game off, it's the camera.
[209:52.63]I don't mind the game.
[209:55.26]I just would love to see it at the angle that I want to see it at.
[210:16.00]Okay So what are you telling me I can just do this You just go in well, I thought if you have less than 100 rings you just get dumped in the garage Don't have to use money to make money I just get free money
[210:49.26]What kind of casino is this?
[210:51.02]Is he gonna play for free?
[210:53.84]Where are the stakes?
[210:54.44]I can't play like this.
[210:55.16]Give me that other, uh... No, no, no.
[211:12.17]Target.
[211:12.49]I want that other target.
[211:15.79]If you don't make enough.
[211:17.66]Three of a kind.
[211:18.28]Now I gotta go through the arrow, right?
[211:23.34]I have this game, too.
[211:25.34]By the way.
[211:25.86]I sent him to the garage.
[211:35.92]Who's this in the lower right?
[211:37.68]Elliot?
[211:38.38]Who the fuck is that?
[211:44.82]I'm gonna hit that other target I have two elliots Alright, that's uh got somebody else's card Get the target, please
[212:17.42]Alright.
[212:18.64]96.
[212:27.09]Where the fuck did I just go?
[212:30.17]Uh... Whaaat?
[212:33.76]Do I have to control this?
[212:36.76]How does it get the bonus?
[212:50.15]What did that do for me?
[212:56.78]I feel like Sonic Pinball, you're a little too- the ball's a little too slow.
[213:00.34]This is very easy.
[213:04.47]Alright, the bonus again.
[213:05.25]I kinda don't want to see it though.
[213:21.18]ResidentSleeper again oh I no don't do it again anything else give me a different bonus please stop this alright now it's stopped what does it
[214:00.19]Am I missing something here?
[214:10.72]Okay, I ended up back here.
[214:11.92]Now I just gotta- I gotta get that target and we can get out of here.
[214:21.24]Control with the joystick?
[214:26.28]No, that's me tilting.
[214:27.72]Now I lost because I'm tilting.
[214:30.86]The game knows when you're cheating.
[214:36.24]Alright, I'm not gonna get dumped in the garage.
[214:37.88]I got my coins.
[214:41.37]I so badly want that last target, but whatever.
[214:43.61]You can't have everything you want.
[215:02.50]okay good nice work so now should I deposit or just leave I got 142 coins alright where's the exit information how do I leave
[215:32.01]Let's throw your rings in the vault.
[215:43.41]I was just gonna hand them to you.
[215:45.15]There's a Chaos Emerald right there!
[216:04.06]We just have to do one more stupid game.
[216:05.60]It's a slot pinball.
[216:10.34]Alright.
[216:15.40]This one's cool.
[216:23.71]See, there's an actual machine here and it's going to spin.
[216:25.89]Look at that.
[216:26.27]That's kind of interesting.
[216:27.19]How do I stop it?
[216:33.50]Do I actually have to stop the rails myself?
[216:37.78]We just need to get to 400.
[216:38.70]I thought I was gonna lose that one.
[216:44.21]Nope.
[216:46.47]Nope, not that one either.
[216:50.16]Final Eggman.
[216:53.78]Oh, he takes your money.
[216:56.84]I just got Bowser'd.
[217:15.69]I didn't think you're gonna watch a guy play pinball.
[217:18.49]Bang, bang, bang.
[217:19.96]Two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[217:24.82]Damn it.
[217:27.22]I had a chance.
[217:29.24]Ring, ring, ring, ring, ding.
[217:34.89]Got it.
[217:35.13]Tails.
[217:35.47]Does that get me?
[217:49.94]Amy, Amy, Amy, no.
[217:52.90]It doesn't do anything for you, huh?
[217:59.92]Ring 3k.
[218:02.58]It's got 3,000 rings?
[218:08.18]What is that?
[218:08.58]It has to be something.
[218:16.11]Almost lost that one, but it's fine.
[218:22.47]Don't fall down!
[218:24.01]It fell.
[218:24.31]Oh, there's a lot back there.
[218:29.98]That's good.
[218:38.22]Went all the way back around to the spring.
[218:49.25]Get in that spot!
[218:53.22]It didn't go all the way in.
[218:54.00]Alright, well I did it.
[218:57.49]I just need how many more?
[218:59.81]A couple hundred?
[219:01.95]I have 140 something, right?
[219:03.27]So that's two... I'm just gonna get it done.
[219:07.18]Right?
[219:07.34]So we don't have to do this again?
[219:08.38]I mean, I act like I'm gonna play through this whole game.
[219:11.48]I'm not.
[219:22.08]What just happened?
[219:25.28]I shook the machine.
[219:26.16]I shouldn't have done that.
[219:26.98]Why would I do that?
[219:30.44]I'm not going to beat this whole game tonight.
[219:33.42]We only can do that with Crazy Taxi.
[219:36.28]That's the only one I'm allowed to give more than like two hours to.
[219:41.34]God, that game is fucking fun.
[219:48.29]Crazy Taxi was sick.
[219:50.13]What a delight that game was.
[219:57.93]Shining what?
[220:02.45]That's a jackpot.
[220:03.25]That was dumb.
[220:06.29]And what is with the timer?
[220:07.15]Isn't there a crazy taxi too?
[220:15.00]I have to get S ranking in that one too.
[220:23.10]Got it.
[220:26.51]You gotta go into the hole with the timer on it.
[220:29.89]Mmm, kind of easier said than done.
[220:31.01]It's tiny.
[220:39.53]One is better this- isn't there actually three of them?
[220:45.31]Lot of tails, good.
[220:52.00]Got it!
[220:58.92]Ah, I see.
[220:59.38]If you hit it in that certain area, it... the game freezes.
[221:03.78]No, it doesn't.
[221:13.73]I got enough.
[221:15.27]But... what?
[221:16.71]Can I get more?
[221:19.49]What happens if I get more?
[221:28.22]Do you actually get anything?
[221:30.94]If I deposit 500 coins... You might get an Eggman.
[221:47.59]Uh-oh!
[221:48.77]Oh, thank god!
[221:54.01]Yes, I got the Sonic Head!
[222:00.21]Look at how many coins this is.
[222:03.34]Wow.
[222:08.62]Oh, look at this.
[222:09.14]Come on, come on, come on.
[222:12.30]This is like 86.
[222:13.05]Get the 86.
[222:13.63]83.
[222:13.79]Oh, that's so many coins.
[222:14.85]No.
[222:18.47]It's just out of reach.
[222:19.27]Come on.
[222:23.40]Damn it.
[222:32.50]Alright, let me get down here.
[222:39.32]I'm gonna max the goddamn game out, guys.
[222:41.00]You know?
[222:41.48]Like, I gotta say that I did that.
[222:45.42]Like, holy shit, that was lucky.
[222:46.94]Okay, just don't hit it up there ever again.
[222:51.63]Damn it!
[222:52.41]No, get the 42!
[222:56.87]This really is like the gambling fallacy.
[223:00.17]Just get out.
[223:01.15]Just leave the casino.
[223:02.31]It's over.
[223:03.21]You already did it.
[223:05.09]You have so much money.
[223:06.19]No, but I want to make a thousand dollars tonight.
[223:10.36]No, just leave.
[223:11.32]You're done.
[223:12.84]You did it.
[223:13.30]No, but see, I just got another big hit.
[223:19.34]No, go home.
[223:28.24]There's so many coins that I didn't get there.
[223:29.74]Look, there's no way I'll get an Eggman.
[223:32.65]I haven't even lost one ball.
[223:36.05]Look at how many extra lives I'm getting.
[223:37.73]You don't think this is worth it?
[223:44.66]I'm untouchable right now.
[223:56.51]Eight extra lives.
[223:57.45]I'm gonna have like 15 extra lives for when I inevitably turn the... It's okay.
[224:03.51]Last ball.
[224:09.38]You could have gotten like 500 rings in the sewer area in two seconds.
[224:14.68]Yeah, but there's no shiny pinball slot machine.
[224:24.16]No balls.
[224:24.94]Yeah, I don't have any balls left.
[224:29.40]Shit, I need one of those.
[224:30.32]I'm gonna get to 999.
[224:42.52]What happens when you get to the 9... If you get one more, does it go to 0?
[224:53.98]Yes!
[224:58.26]Alright, there's 40- There's 42 up there!
[225:00.20]Wait.
[225:03.34]I get it.
[225:05.04]We're fine.
[225:20.09]Game doesn't even work.
[225:33.24]The game doesn't even work and I get to win look at that Didn't think we were getting 999 boys and girls we're getting there Okay, we're good lightning can't strike twice there I don't think I
[226:03.45]The house always wins.
[226:06.27]Yeah.
[226:08.99]It's not enough.
[226:11.39]700 coins.
[226:12.15]Ugh!
[226:17.21]Quick, deposit in the vault before they know what happened.
[226:29.46]Am I just depositing it into their vault?
[226:39.24]Alright, that's it.
[226:42.54]851.
[226:42.56]Where's my- give me my prize!
[226:58.31]Got the Chaos Emerald.
[227:06.59]Can I get a new egg?
[227:09.74]Well, that was fun.
[227:11.85]I blew every cent I have.
[227:15.01]You really should have left when we had a chance.
[227:16.89]Shut up, Tails.
[227:18.09]You don't know me.
[227:23.01]Why would you hit on a 19?
[227:23.87]Shut the fuck up.
[227:25.85]I thought there was a two in there.
[227:30.99]Eggman.
[227:39.06]Did he just steal it from me?
[227:42.32]How does that always work?
[227:44.30]What the hell is that?
[228:07.83]You see that thing that just flew by?
[228:10.29]Alright, now we gotta go to the sewer.
[228:12.77]The sewer was down... out of the casino.
[228:24.64]This is not bad.
[228:25.28]This game's not bad.
[228:35.80]Go get the key.
[228:37.40]Was it in the casino area?
[228:42.54]Was there an alley?
[228:43.88]Was that actually over here somewhere?
[228:46.28]Got it.
[228:46.82]Okay.
[228:58.17]So, pick this up.
[228:59.61]The ice stone looks like a key.
[229:00.67]Maybe I can use it in the Mystic Ruins.
[229:03.85]So I have to get back on the train.
[229:12.53]Oh, it's a cat.
[229:15.45]Alright, bye.
[229:42.19]I gotta get on the train.
[229:45.65]Can I like... Where the hell is that train?
[230:10.56]I don't remember where the hell the train is.
[230:16.44]Go in the elevator.
[230:19.08]This elevator.
[230:23.09]I went through the train station.
[230:27.25]Um... Where's my key?
[230:40.03]Okay.
[230:41.57]What are Chao?
[230:42.49]Raising Chao.
[230:43.25]Feeding Chao.
[230:43.85]How to get fruits.
[230:44.57]Small animals.
[230:45.34]Caring for Chao.
[230:46.04]Breeding Chao.
[230:47.34]Right.
[231:04.03]How do I get from the hatch?
[231:07.23]Is it like a little hatching pod?
[231:11.30]Warpole!
[231:12.10]You can go easily to gardens you have previously been to.
[231:15.20]You may bring Chao and eggs with you, too.
[231:18.52]Okay.
[231:22.55]Throw the eggs.
[231:24.21]Throw.
[231:37.88]Oh, that's an animal.
[231:38.70]Come here.
[231:41.54]How do I feed it?
[231:47.21]Jump and throw against the wall.
[231:49.85]I don't know if that's a good idea.
[231:52.31]Is that gonna... it's not gonna break, is it?
[232:01.82]What?
[232:02.58]You can actually do that?
[232:03.78]That's not what you're supposed to do, right?
[232:16.02]Okay, we'll power, swim, fly, run.
[232:19.48]Okay, that's kinda cool.
[232:20.80]You can name.
[232:23.18]Uhh... What?
[232:39.01]Oh, I sent it back?
[232:40.01]You just were born.
[232:40.83]Go, go get a job.
[232:48.31]Ooh, another one!
[232:49.89]Wait, is this the same one?
[233:02.24]How many are there?
[233:06.54]No, this is... Okay, well, that's an interesting thing.
[233:16.39]Chao Stadium.
[233:18.77]So you can kind of fight them and breed them.
[233:20.25]That's interesting.
[233:23.58]What do the gardens do?
[233:31.32]Do I have to take one with me?
[233:32.04]Is that how it works?
[233:42.83]What happened to you?
[233:46.71]Alright, I'm out.
[233:53.03]There are other gardens.
[233:53.97]Alright, so, uh, the train station, right?
[233:59.70]I... I go... back?
[234:03.98]Where's that train?
[234:04.66]I don't even know.
[234:05.28]I ran, like, by it, like, three times, I think.
[234:13.90]Get in!
[234:14.62]What the hell?
[234:27.16]Okay, so what is this?
[234:35.42]This is the crystal ring.
[234:36.83]What do I get to do with this?
[234:37.73]This reduces the time needed to store power for the light speed dash.
[234:41.27]Nice.
[234:44.19]Let's see how, let's see what the timer is.
[234:45.67]I can move around with this on.
[234:53.18]What does that activate?
[234:54.56]Is that just the door?
[234:55.35]There's no other cool thing to do there?
[235:03.35]Is it gonna play through the whole game?
[235:04.51]Uh, no.
[235:05.09]I don't think so.
[235:07.15]We have a couple other things to get through that I'd want to play.
[235:10.78]This game's fun, though.
[235:11.82]It's not... It's not a bad game.
[235:15.68]I have to go back to the casino alley to get the key, even though... Because I went into the dumb garden...
[235:25.11]Play the whole thing.
[235:26.00]Do you guys really want that?
[235:33.72]Don't play the stupid idiot blue rat game.
[235:45.53]I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[235:46.63]Don't worry.
[235:47.05]I just need to know where the elevator is.
[235:48.87]No, not the elevator.
[235:49.73]The train.
[235:50.25]Do I have to go out here?
[235:56.13]Where is the train?
[236:00.95]It's up the stairs.
[236:15.68]No, not that way.
[236:17.44]Not that way.
[236:19.14]Not that towards the casino.
[236:25.85]Chao Garden?
[236:26.83]There it is.
[236:28.40]So I have to bring this to the Ice Center.
[236:34.98]Where the hell that is?
[236:56.53]In there.
[236:56.95]I'm assuming it's the giant wall that just broke open.
[237:05.31]Uh... Is it not?
[237:10.06]Okay.
[237:25.23]Didn't you see a stone with an ice pattern on it?
[237:27.75]I don't think I did.
[237:44.48]The one guy who said it's not the right way.
[237:46.62]It's the thing I saw when I looked over.
[237:48.84]That's what I saw.
[237:51.73]I saw more than one guy.
[237:54.20]I saw, like, wrong way, idiot.
[237:55.86]Like, is he this bad?
[237:56.82]And I'm like, that has to be right, because he said that.
[237:58.50]Alright, here we go.
[238:14.96]Cold.
[238:16.08]Ice.
[238:17.38]Interesting.
[238:19.22]Since when does Sonic use a ladder?
[238:24.37]Ice cap!
[238:26.80]Get the Chaos Emerald.
[238:27.82]You got it.
[238:28.82]Wait, does it... does it work?
[238:29.84]Even if you're frozen, jump a couple of times and you should be able to crack through.
[238:33.80]Okay.
[238:35.04]What was that?
[238:39.59]I don't know.
[238:47.55]So I gotta continuously jump?
[238:48.85]Uh, that's very awkward.
[238:50.54]That's awkward.
[238:51.42]Shoot the gun?
[238:52.64]Uh, did I?
[238:53.20]Was that correct?
[239:19.79]I guess.
[239:20.97]No, I have the Sonic Run super thing, don't I?
[239:23.09]What the hell am I doing?
[239:24.05]I have the thing where I can just run across it.
[239:42.82]These are not even on the same plane.
[239:44.68]Fuck.
[239:48.03]Whatever.
[239:56.37]Oh, let me see what this does.
[239:57.51]That's pretty great.
[240:01.85]It's an easy way to collect all the coins.
[240:04.25]Oh, fuck!
[240:04.77]Easy, easy, easy.
[240:05.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[240:27.26]Wait till it's done Be careful not to fall off I think I'm gonna fall off Whoa
[240:58.23]Straight through.
[240:59.59]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[241:05.55]Oh.
[241:12.04]Snowboard level.
[241:13.04]Oh, cool.
[241:13.60]Alright.
[241:16.60]Is there anything else?
[241:17.16]Can I just jump or just get away from it?
[241:21.10]I guess.
[241:29.02]This is totally radical, man.
[241:36.99]Now the real game starts.
[241:44.95]This is by far the coolest thing in the game so far.
[241:57.17]Jesus.
[241:59.07]It's too fast.
[242:10.59]I'm missing every ring.
[242:12.44]It's okay.
[242:13.94]Oops.
[242:20.96]Am I closing in enemies?
[242:30.60]Easy.
[242:30.84]I think there's a secret right there.
[242:38.38]I kinda just went right by.
[242:39.30]It's alright.
[242:54.92]Hurry up!
[242:55.78]Hurry up!
[243:02.61]Tricks?
[243:02.93]I don't have any tricks I can do.
[243:08.81]Can I just get the emerald?
[243:18.28]How many em- I don't have very many other emeralds to get.
[243:45.82]How many realistically do I have?
[243:48.10]Three?
[243:48.86]Two?
[243:51.26]Am I not allowed to leave?
[244:12.54]The train headed for Station Square will be departing soon.
[244:16.22]Alright, so, uh, I'm gonna go to the sewer.
[244:23.02]No, bake the cat in the last 15 minutes.
[244:25.07]I'm sorry, I don't know what to do.
[244:26.37]Does Sonic have, I mean, does Tails have anything for me to do in here or no?
[244:33.23]Just leave.
[244:43.83]Play as big the cat.
[244:58.03]Go to the lake.
[244:58.83]Uh... What do you mean, go to the lake?
[245:02.83]Sorry, I went in here.
[245:18.91]What's up, Knuckles?
[245:20.25]What's his voice like in this game?
[245:25.04]Something bugging you?
[245:26.14]Like Raphael from Ninja Turtles, right?
[245:28.28]No time for games, Sonic.
[245:29.88]Kind of.
[245:30.48]Give me the emeralds you have, right now!
[245:35.20]What?
[245:35.92]Let's just see you take them.
[245:37.43]Fight with Knuckles?
[245:41.15]I could kick his ass.
[245:41.91]Watch this.
[245:42.33]Ready?
[245:43.01]Oh, no.
[245:45.65]Oh, no.
[245:47.64]Give it your best.
[245:48.52]Oh, no.
[245:51.40]I would.
[245:54.72]Oh, no.
[245:55.76]The chaos emeralds.
[245:58.39]These things are all punch.
[246:05.01]Ah, Eggman.
[246:07.29]Uh-oh.
[246:09.11]Ha, life's taking candy from a baby.
[246:17.15]That's a Chaos Emerald!
[246:20.77]That's right, fool!
[246:22.47]You made it all too easy!
[246:24.15]You practically gave them to me!
[246:28.01]Alright, I think we're gonna move on to Knights.
[246:32.64]Knuckles, don't tell me Eggman tricked you again!
[246:35.18]Me?
[246:36.44]What about you?
[246:37.56]It's not a bad game, we just, we've seen it.
[246:42.36]Now, I have four lovely emeralds!
[246:47.61]Chaos!
[246:50.59]Control!
[246:53.23]Right?
[246:55.35]Oh no, that's Shadow.
[246:59.55]These are for you, my friend!
[247:11.24]Ah!
[247:11.70]He transformed again!
[247:13.44]Man!
[247:14.25]No one ever cuts us any slack!
[247:16.76]Be more careful with some of the most powerful artifacts in the universe.
[247:21.84]Now put them in your back pocket.
[247:24.02]Store them in a safe inside of a safe with a 25 keypad hash.
[247:30.19]Oh, I can't touch the water.
[247:48.09]It's confusing.
[247:55.01]Is that a do?
[248:02.06]No, just keep doing that.
[248:09.31]I'm going to assume I'm not supposed to be able to see through this water here.
[248:14.20]Am I correct in that assessment?
[248:16.46]This should be a lot harder.
[248:17.72]I'm not supposed to be able to see him in the water.
[248:22.71]You are!
[248:22.99]Oh.
[248:42.65]I thought it was supposed to be, you can see, like, the surface level.
[248:46.19]Not his whole head.
[248:53.39]Yeah, this is the... Standing in the water is weird.
[248:58.56]One more hit.
[249:00.10]Alright, come together again.
[249:15.06]Come on!
[249:17.52]Come on, I got other games to play!
[249:19.50]Dammit, come on, I'm trying to... Am I missing something here?
[249:37.36]Can you put your head up?
[249:39.14]Put your head up!
[249:41.32]Hello?
[249:41.98]There you go.
[249:49.71]This is the game you're playing, Jeremy.
[249:54.18]Huh?
[249:54.50]Wait, the general consensus is everyone hates this?
[249:59.81]We just got a new full motion video cutscene.
[250:13.82]That's not bad.
[250:18.36]Behold my floating masterpiece, the Egg Carrier!
[250:23.04]When is Jetcrime Radio?
[250:24.72]Very soon.
[250:25.26]Fuck, it pales in comparison to the power of Chaos!
[250:29.66]Adieu, until we meet again, my friends!
[250:32.36]Alright, that's probably a good stopping point for Sonic.
[250:46.58]Hey, we can't let him get away.
[250:49.20]Let's get to my workshop and we'll take the tornado.
[250:52.84]Yeah.
[250:54.78]You guys go.
[250:58.92]I have some unfinished business to take care of.
[251:00.70]I mean, this is terrible.
[251:01.94]No problem, Knuckles.
[251:03.70]Objectively, this is awful.
[251:07.10]But, like, the video game is not that bad.
[251:09.18]It's pretty decent.
[251:24.92]The game is, I think, fun.
[251:26.98]Sonic's cool.
[251:27.68]There's nothing wrong with Sonic.
[251:28.92]It's just... Those cutscenes are just... There's nothing to them, right?
[251:36.08]Let's go see Big the Cat.
[251:47.71]Hey, look.
[251:48.47]For all the... Sonic is still around.
[251:50.67]Sonic is still kicking.
[251:52.61]He's doing just fine.
[251:53.76]Go to the Mystic Ruins.
[251:55.42]You might find something.
[251:58.40]Uh, Twinkle Park.
[252:05.28]Uh, only... Oh, ID card only.
[252:06.92]Okay.
[252:10.31]What is this?
[252:12.89]Special for couples right now.
[252:14.35]Okay.
[252:18.17]When this came out, and I played that first level, I was blown away.
[252:22.57]Because this is like the first time they ever really did anything really like this.
[252:28.09]You gotta give them the credit where it's due.
[252:29.75]It is.
[252:34.07]Here's the sewer.
[252:37.15]Can I do anything else in here?
[252:45.76]Hmm.
[252:54.22]I guess there's nothing I can do in here.
[252:56.72]Why do I keep going back to the sewer?
[252:57.96]I don't know.
[252:59.20]You see, because I kind of just ran away.

[254:05.18]Yeah.
[254:05.64]I... I can't break it.
[254:27.67]Alright, I'm gonna move on.
[254:30.67]That was Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Adventure.
[254:32.31]It was a fun game and pretty cool.
[254:48.82]It's good.
[254:50.20]I didn't save the game.
[254:51.66]What, I didn't save it?
[254:53.64]Yeah, I did, didn't I?
[254:54.70]It's okay.
[254:58.19]Alright, coming up next, we have Nights.
[255:02.69]Nights into Dreams.
[255:11.42]We want Floygan Brothers.
[255:12.94]I'm sorry, I can't deliver.
[255:19.08]Nights is Saturn, not Dreamcast.
[255:20.98]Fake SEGA Gamer?
[255:21.88]That's not true.
[255:25.25]This was ported to Dreamcast.
[255:27.47]There was one on Dreamcast.
[255:39.29]Is Knights going to open?
[255:47.52]Knights was on Dream.
[255:48.28]Yes, it was.
[255:50.32]No, you said Knights was on Breakfast.
[255:57.78]Did I finish Resident Evil 2?
[255:58.90]Yeah, I did.
[255:59.54]Well, I did Leon's campaign.
[256:06.02]No, we're not going back to the Flaygan brothers.

[256:28.53]Alright.
[256:33.13]This is made by the same company that made Sonic, by the way.
[256:42.54]It's going to be very loud.
[256:44.06]I'm just warning everybody.
[256:45.08]No, it's not.
[256:45.46]I turned it all down.
[256:46.02]We're good.
[256:48.76]PEGI 16.

[257:27.08]These games are for children.
[257:32.15]Why do you play little children's games?
[257:34.85]These games are not for children.
[257:36.27]These are the games that you played when you were... This is what was available.
[257:43.02]This is the game that was available to play like 20 years ago.
[257:46.94]Doesn't matter how old you were.
[258:00.12]And just wait.
[258:01.83]This is gonna be one of the DLC characters.
[258:03.67]What did I just do?
[258:04.99]Alright, let's go.
[258:07.03]How do you play?
[258:07.71]What are you supposed to do in this game?
[258:31.38]I can't play this.
[258:32.00]I have to stop playing.
[258:33.42]This is gonna make me fucking sick.
[258:39.93]Oh, this is fun though.
[258:42.71]What do I need to do?
[259:09.85]Nice, okay.
[259:10.67]I got it.
[259:12.12]How do I get out of that?
[259:47.83]Guys, this is a classic.
[259:48.89]You can't be... It's part of the collection, so we have to play it.
[260:05.15]Beware!
[260:06.09]Oh, I did it.
[260:26.36]What in the flying hell is happening?
[260:27.68]I'm actually... I think I have an idea.
[260:32.92]Slightly.
[260:33.58]Somewhat.
[260:34.01]An idea.
[260:35.13]I want to see... Let's go back.
[260:38.47]Let me see the SEGA Saturn.
[260:45.67]This is the classic.
[260:46.85]I thought you go forward. ...
[260:57.92]It's just... worse graphics.
[261:01.26]Yeah, you have to, like, pick them.
[261:04.86]They steal all your stuff.
[261:05.94]You have to get them back.
[261:08.08]This looks cooler.
[261:28.15]I prefer it like this, actually.
[261:30.17]You gotta collect the orbs.
[261:36.53]How do you go in the other direction?
[261:43.36]The waterfall just kind of throws you in a weird way?
[262:00.48]I see.
[262:00.78]So you have enough orbs to destroy them.
[262:02.72]And you gotta do it again.
[262:04.26]Collect them all.
[262:05.10]And you have a timer.
[262:09.42]I see.
[262:10.44]This is fun.
[262:12.02]This is cool.
[262:13.00]This is an interesting concept.
[262:15.45]I got a D.
[262:34.55]You're in a dream.
[262:35.49]Got it?
[262:36.35]Can you go through that?
[262:38.27]Do I have the orbs?
[262:44.37]Not quite.
[263:12.77]Would you please turn it up?
[263:14.63]Why would you want me to turn it up if it's too loud?
[263:18.04]No, not yet.
[263:25.34]Let me just beat this first level.
[263:26.70]The more that I do this, the more that I think this is actually kind of fun.
[263:37.65]Alright, I should have enough.
[263:46.02]Where's the bad guy?
[263:46.70]There he is.
[263:47.14]A. B. So there's one more somewhere.
[263:59.45]I think I just gotta check them.
[264:16.14]Alright, not that many- I just- here's the yellow one.
[264:19.80]Well, that's cool.
[264:20.92]What happened to my view?
[264:23.24]This is... I feel like I'm glitching a game.
[264:25.77]Did I do it?
[264:48.03]Oh, there's tricks!
[264:49.65]I'm getting points for tricks.
[264:54.01]Oh, a doctor.
[264:55.45]Where are the rings?
[265:18.05]Got it.
[265:22.11]Screw there, out, out, out, out, just go.
[265:25.39]And that should be it, right?
[265:27.37]Got him.
[265:36.88]There's more.
[265:38.16]It puts you on a different plane every time you get a new...
[265:49.47]Somebody just wrote, I'm so fucking angry.
[265:51.53]Why?
[265:51.65]It's just that we're just flying around.
[265:53.05]I'm so angry.
[266:25.48]Finally I get to get... ah, actually this is way worse than the other ones.
[266:28.86]I feel like I'm drowning right now.
[266:33.04]And I'm desperately trying to get air.
[266:38.69]Holy shit, a hundred dollars of stamina.
[266:50.95]Is that enough?
[266:53.74]Okay, nice.
[266:56.45]No, no, no, not is that enough money.
[266:58.55]I'm saying, is that enough of knights?
[267:01.87]Did I do it?
[267:04.68]Juno, thank you for the hundred dollars, Juno.
[267:08.66]One hundred.
[267:14.64]I'm so fucking angry.
[267:16.42]Alright, I did it.
[267:20.07]I win.
[267:22.86]You missed my bits earlier, but honestly, I want the nice, shiny pink badge.
[267:28.64]Thank you so much, Juno.
[267:30.04]Sorry I missed your bits from earlier.
[267:31.16]Actually, I think I... What is going on?
[267:36.69]I'm in a bus.
[267:40.93]Oh, Jesus.
[267:46.57]Minus five.
[267:50.74]Hold on, let me look at this for a second.
[267:55.18]Is there something I should be doing?
[267:57.42]Wrapping around, hitting her in the stomach?
[268:02.52]Yep, right in the stomach.
[268:12.39]Fuck.
[268:12.67]I gotta get her right in the jewel.
[268:16.03]Three times?
[268:18.57]More than that?
[268:26.12]Shit.
[268:27.12]I still got it, but I got minus 5.
[268:33.56]Down the hall.
[268:34.26]Do I have to break her out of this place?
[268:41.95]Hold on.
[268:43.09]What's over here?
[268:44.69]I think I have to break out the door.
[268:53.41]Yep.
[268:54.74]That's what has to be done.
[268:55.78]I only have 17 seconds to do this.
[269:02.13]I'll just walk here.
[269:08.11]This is the piano.
[269:11.63]This is the piano thing.
[269:17.30]Come on, break it!
[269:18.28]Oh, well.
[269:28.94]What is that?
[269:30.64]Snail with a giant mouth?
[269:32.16]That is the weirdest looking monster.
[269:33.68]Well, that's the whole night.
[269:39.38]Alright, let's play something else.
[269:46.41]It wasn't bad.
[269:47.19]It's cool.
[269:47.67]If you've played it, you think it's funny.
[269:49.41]I'm glad you do.
[269:54.55]I was going to say DLC for Smash Brothers, but that would have been kind of interesting to say like 30 minutes ago.
[270:02.38]Okay.
[270:07.14]It crashed, but that's fine.
[270:14.12]I know you've been waiting a long time.
[270:15.90]Some of you guys have been waiting here for a very long time.
[270:20.20]We're going to play Jet Set Radio.
[270:33.83]It really is too bad that Space Channel 5 did not work.
[270:40.08]Okay, Jet Set Radio.
[270:44.08]It's been a very long time since I've played this.
[270:45.52]Okay, Window No.
[270:55.79]Yeah, I think it's good to go already.
[270:58.61]Seems like it is.
[271:05.68]SEGA.
[271:06.08]This game kicks ass.
[271:12.56]Yeah, it does.
[271:14.24]It's pretty great.
[271:18.78]Graffiti is art.
[271:19.50]However, graffiti is an act of vandalism and is a crime.
[271:22.30]What?
[271:28.60]I just got a please don't do graffiti warning.
[271:33.67]Jetson Radio!
[271:40.79]By the way, I know one of the town... We're gonna go to Shibuya-cho.
[271:45.11]I might as well just do this.
[271:49.91]Shibuya-cho!
[271:52.09]There it is!
[271:52.65]Let's practice.
[272:10.43]Lesson one.
[272:11.35]Skate forward by pushing forward.
[272:13.11]Yep.
[272:14.41]I don't think I figured it out.
[272:24.62]Can you teach me something else?
[272:34.18]I know how to skate forward.
[272:38.24]Is there anything else I can learn here?
[272:41.04]I just want... Okay, so that's right trigger.
[272:50.41]Try doing a little freestyle skating without bumping into anything.
[273:32.45]I think I know how to do that, but... Can you tell?
[273:45.81]How do I do anything?
[273:54.05]I think I just know how to play.
[273:59.51]The tutorial doesn't want to tell me how to do anything else We're just gonna have to learn on our own
[274:21.85]Hardcore punk music.
[274:48.21]They roam the streets and cover the city with their personal graffiti, claiming that it is their way of expressing themselves to the world.
[274:54.74]However, ever since the Metropolitan Government and the financial conglomerate, the Rokkaku Group, combined their efforts to co-found the 21st Century Project, the streets of Tokyoto have never been the same again.
[275:07.07]Police crackdowns on the Rudis have become more severe, and Captain Onishima is more anxious than ever to put them behind bars.
[275:14.05]The streets of Tokyoto are ready to explode.
[275:19.62]And that's where you come in.
[275:22.34]Hold it, you can't go tripping through the streets until you learn some of the basics.
[275:24.82]No, I skipped this.
[275:33.55]Okay.
[275:38.02]What?
[275:39.92]Yeah, I... Just did it.
[275:49.40]Um... I know I can't go through the Roadrunner.
[275:54.67]Okay.
[275:56.39]Um... Try this.
[275:58.75]Hold down right trigger and then press jump.
[276:11.62]Okay.
[276:22.54]I have to go... I think I have to follow everywhere that you go.
[276:37.61]Let's see.
[276:38.35]Okay.
[276:38.93]He's going for the car.
[276:40.61]Hahaha!
[276:57.02]alright hey you sweet now try this next run if you pull left trigger the camera will automatically face forward try this line alright I currently have an h
[277:38.10]Alright, now it's time to get serious.
[277:42.32]If you see something floating over your head, pull left trigger to start spraying.
[277:48.08]You need spray plants.
[277:51.13]Yeah, you gotta spray everything, right?
[277:58.95]All the opportunities to spray?
[278:05.19]You can spray while you're grinding.
[278:07.91]Give it a whirl.
[278:27.46]Gum has joined you.
[278:39.75]Good.
[278:41.33]Not bad, I guess I can join you.
[278:42.63]Now this is better than the Floygan Brothers.
[278:48.95]Think you can keep up with me?
[278:50.91]Let's check your qualifications.
[278:53.76]If you see an arrow, use left to follow it and paint some fat lines.
[278:57.36]Double jump and spray.
[278:58.93]I can do that.
[279:24.68]You gotta flick your hand around.
[279:26.73]If you think you're all that, try this.
[279:54.80]If you grab onto the back of a car, you can slide uphill with ease.
[280:01.72]If you walk into traffic, you can get hurt.
[280:05.57]I have to do all these animations in real life.
[280:09.69]I'm not gonna do that.
[280:31.64]Come back all the way down and spray something down here.
[280:39.44]Grind that.
[280:44.63]Spray that.
[280:45.65]Alright, well I don't know what the button was to grab a car.
[281:03.70]I'm very clearly pushing this car.
[281:05.34]And back down.
[281:06.86]Okay, I did it.
[281:35.75]I almost missed it, but I got it.
[281:42.87]One last run.
[281:44.93]Grind, jump over the railing, grind.
[281:56.16]Stay grinding, down the whole thing, up on top of the .
[282:10.02]Had to get some speed.
[282:29.33]I guess you're cool.
[282:33.65]Listen up, bullets can't touch you when you're dashing, got it?
[282:36.12]That's the worst possible advice you could give to anybody.
[282:47.25]Hey out there, this is Tokyo's very own number one pirate power station, Jet Set Radio!
[282:53.69]Over the hood, through the streets, and right into your brain!
[282:57.89]We're transmitting our signal straight to you!
[283:00.67]Y'all got your antennas on or what?
[283:02.71]Yeah!
[283:03.33]We're bright and high in a smooth stream of supersonic sound!
[283:07.57]And I'm your captain and DJ, Professor K!
[283:12.40]Jet Set Radio!
[283:16.97]Three gangs are fighting for the Tokyo streets.
[283:20.15]In the west, from Benton Cho, the city of the night, we got those high-tech maniacs, those mad machines, the noise tanks.
[283:28.43]And in the east, from Kobane Cho, the city of the sunset, it's that crazy, monster-mask-wearing gang, Poison Jam.
[283:37.58]And from Shibuya Cho, in the south, the city of daylight, it's those troublemaking punks, the Gee-Gees.
[283:45.82]The GG's home turf, Shibuya Cho, was just attacked.
[283:50.62]Was it poison jam?
[283:52.38]They were talking about spreading out there.
[283:54.83]Or maybe it was the noise tank trying to send its sister craft through the whole city.
[283:59.89]Listen up, all you innocent fools out there.
[284:02.97]Officer Onishima has got some special order Satsu bracelets.
[284:06.60]It's all ready for you.
[284:08.10]Get yourself to the bathroom and brush those teeth, boys and girls, because a whole road of trouble is heading your way.
[284:16.82]Brush your teeth.
[284:18.52]Chapter one, let's go.
[284:19.44]For real, here it comes.
[284:21.64]You got internet.
[284:24.56]I don't have any radio system, graffiti.
[284:28.95]You can create your own graffiti.
[285:20.46]let's get a good one let's get I need a different color and then
[286:20.04]I'm gonna tag it now.
[286:21.76]No, no, no.
[286:23.58]Back, back, back, back, back.
[286:25.43]Back.
[286:48.93]Camel.
[286:50.01]Camel is fine.
[286:50.87]How do I make that bigger?
[286:56.01]Alright, let's play the fucking game.
[287:05.30]Like, I can't... It's gonna take too long.
[287:14.38]Yes, I'd like to go back.
[287:28.23]I still have to do the small ones.
[287:29.85]I'll do the small ones.
[287:35.24]I'm thinking I'll do like a green square.
[288:20.28]That looks good.
[288:21.06]X. And then on top of that, I'm going to put a clip art.
[288:56.51]That's hard to control.
[288:57.33]Here we go.
[288:57.87]Extra large.
[288:59.42]Um... God, I don't know.
[289:02.72]Let's just... I'm gonna say we need a... I wish we could make this bigger.
[289:29.24]I want red.
[290:07.88]Good enough.
[290:08.62]I didn't say fucking Garfield.
[290:14.18]Now we're going to go to wherever we can go.
[290:19.28]Graffiti.
[290:19.79]Power.
[290:53.77]Find the red arrows and start tagging them.
[290:56.45]My pleasure.
[290:57.04]I don't have any paint.
[291:03.48]Let me try.
[291:04.56]No.
[291:05.00]There's no, there's no net.
[291:12.65]Can I not grind?
[291:13.31]What's going on?
[291:21.89]Alright, well I am gonna retry.
[291:24.17]I can't.
[291:28.17]HQ to all stations, HQ to all stations, juvenile skaters have been spotted fleeing in the vicinity of Shibuya Bus Terminal.
[291:39.42]All officers respond, repeat.
[291:50.92]Yeah, you have to outrun the police now, I remember.
[292:02.81]Any more over this way?
[292:03.71]The red arrow here?
[292:04.65]Yeah, there's a couple up there.
[292:05.59]It's like a route from the big right here.
[292:07.46]Come on, really?
[292:10.74]What the fuck?
[292:13.28]What is- how is this wrong?
[292:19.38]Um, hello?
[292:22.82]What?
[292:25.30]That was odd.
[292:57.91]Don't think I'm out of tank.
[293:02.26]How many more are there?
[293:04.37]I think that's just that one.
[293:06.83]One more on this little side.
[293:21.50]He shoots at you.
[293:25.81]Give me that.
[293:28.13]Why are the police not going after you?
[293:29.41]No, there's a guy right behind me.
[293:35.61]I'm going to go.
[293:52.04]Come on.
[293:54.38]No, no, no, no, no.
[293:55.80]Well... I am doing it in one motion.
[293:58.38]I am doing it in one motion.
[294:01.67]Absolutely not.
[294:30.28]Do you have to press triangle?
[294:39.69]I don't think you do.
[294:43.33]Maybe I'm just wrong.
[294:48.17]Is that one up there I can get still?
[295:05.12]Don't shoot me.
[295:07.04]Don't shoot me.
[295:09.54]Thank God.
[295:13.55]I'm only missing like one more, right?
[295:18.19]That's mine.
[295:18.67]That's mine.
[295:19.11]That's mine.
[295:38.71]You're a bad shot, but it's alright.
[295:41.25]Ooh, that hurts.
[296:09.03]There's one more that I have to get.
[296:11.31]It's right here.
[296:15.41]Give it to me.
[296:20.89]No, get off.
[296:21.45]Out, out, out, out, out.
[296:22.69]Isn't there a way to make him stop?
[296:30.15]I think there is.
[296:43.27]Whatever it is, I have no idea how to do it.
[297:14.94]Got it.
[297:15.28]Okay, run.
[297:15.98]Jesus.
[297:20.63]That's right.
[297:26.54]Let's get scratchin'.
[297:33.47]I'm hijacking the airways and terrorizing you with tunes because we're going to turn these dirty streets into one big dance party.
[297:41.31]Jet Set Radio!
[297:43.83]Those cats who ransacked Shibuya Cho turned out to be the love shockers.
[297:48.87]Love broke their hearts, and now they're looking to do some breaking of their own.
[297:53.05]Watch out for these psychos.
[297:54.99]When you see their heart-shaped graffiti around, you know someone somewhere is crying with a ooky ooky waku waku feeling.
[298:01.92]Can the GG save Shibuya Cho from the trap of love, or is it too late?
[298:09.83]Alright.
[298:11.89]Let's do it again.
[298:15.40]Love trap.
[298:25.29]Hydrate?
[298:27.00]Uh, I'll take a break here in a minute.
[298:28.58]Go grab a water.
[298:32.20]I gotta get a good wine.
[298:33.80]It's all about the wines in this game.
[298:42.05]Some polymer.
[298:46.07]I don't have any... I need some spray paint.
[298:49.21]Oh shit, you gotta go off and around.
[298:51.29]Alright, I get it.
[298:52.59]Let's go this way.
[299:15.70]oh boy this is awkward oh man I'm trying to do this jump and get it but it's much harder than it looks you can't just go up
[300:03.69]Still too far away, how are you supposed to, you can't, it won't let you do it.
[300:06.93]What the fuck?
[300:08.03]Still didn't get it.
[300:12.66]Okay.
[300:32.51]Alright, well that was painful.
[300:39.11]Don't get me out of here.
[300:47.38]Where to?
[300:48.02]Up this way.
[300:49.32]Or not.
[300:52.32]That's the exit.
[300:54.38]That's not the way I want to go.
[300:59.70]Well, the police are here.
[301:03.80]Really like how why are you not grinding this rough?
[301:11.61]Wow, okay Sure
[301:44.23]This game is like freaking me out with this music.
[301:52.06]Alright, we're gonna go this way.
[301:54.34]God.
[302:14.59]Did I just actually hit run over on Cyborg?
[302:17.79]Who the hell did that?
[302:25.95]Get him!
[302:27.79]They're coming after me!
[302:32.51]God, here we go.
[302:53.22]What is going on?
[302:54.32]I'm doing it right now.
[302:56.22]Hello?
[302:57.70]What?
[302:59.60]What?
[303:00.04]I'm so confused right now.
[303:06.80]I'm not sure if I can keep it going.
[303:23.85]Where is this taking me?
[303:25.42]I'm gonna climb it like a fucking frog, whatever.
[303:55.04]Why did you just grab onto the car?
[304:01.58]What the fuck?
[304:11.59]Why?
[304:12.03]Did I really just fall down off a lift?
[304:17.49]Is this me with skates on?
[304:18.81]I don't understand.
[304:34.36]Alright, I'm going to try this again.
[304:37.74]I just shot him.
[304:40.45]That one's done.
[304:42.11]I want to go up and above.
[304:46.39]No, please.
[305:00.88]How is that incorrect?
[305:07.34]I don't understand why that one's incorrect almost every time.
[305:11.01]Now it's correct.
[305:11.95]And now I can't even start it.
[305:15.27]That motion hasn't changed the entire time I've been playing the game.
[305:19.19]What the fuck?
[305:32.39]Shit, I gotta make it... I gotta go faster across this line here.
[305:43.24]I couldn't get past the tutorial when I recently played it.
[305:56.90]It is very precise, I will say.
[306:03.67]Now what I want to do is grind this thing.
[306:07.17]Alright, there's two.
[306:09.95]Did I not pick up the tank?
[306:17.60]I thought I had like a bunch more.
[306:19.18]Uh, does it help?
[306:57.81]That wasn't a tutorial.
[306:59.77]I didn't play horse with one of the tutorial characters and have him tell me how to wall ride.
[307:03.79]I need paint though.
[307:11.99]Oh my god.
[307:15.63]No, I want a grind of rails.
[307:17.87]Oh my god.
[307:19.21]It's so precise.
[307:25.91]I don't remember this game being this hard.
[307:27.51]Alright, can you get off of the rail?
[307:50.79]I just left some.
[307:51.49]I just exited the level.
[307:52.93]Not even like a confirmation?
[307:56.77]You just go back to the main menu?
[308:23.02]I know it says exit, but you're not gonna like turn me around and put me back?
[308:33.57]No, that's how you exit to the main window.
[308:35.51]This is headquarters to motorcycle units.
[308:37.11]Headquarters to motorcycle units.
[308:38.93]Capture the suspect at all costs.
[308:53.13]It's like I'm made out of fucking wood.
[308:57.13]Get out of the way.
[309:29.24]Get off of this!
[309:30.56]Get off!
[309:44.24]Is there a reason why you guys have to show up right when I press left trigger on the wall and trash into me?
[309:52.99]You can't... There they come again.
[310:01.77]They don't even try to arrest you.
[310:03.32]They just drive into you.
[310:06.68]And then they all drive up the cliff and die.
[310:12.70]You got him.
[310:33.03]Why did I just read?
[310:36.28]What the fuck are you talking about?
[310:40.58]What does that even mean?
[310:42.22]Alright, I'm...
[310:58.37]I can't even... I can't concentrate now.
[311:00.53]It's okay, but I need more pink.
[311:25.73]I can't fucking do this, man.
[311:27.91]This game's very good, but it's very versatile, it's very hard, and there's a lot of, you know, if you like characters that mention fucking wood, then you'll love it.
[311:38.00]But no, this game's actually very cool.
[311:40.47]It paved the way for a defining genre-bending, genre-creating experience.
[312:00.40]Finish it!
[312:01.13]How much more is this?
[312:04.45]Yeah, that's gonna be at least a million points.
[312:11.88]Stop with that.
[312:14.04]You don't get to quit this one.
[312:17.64]Who said I was gonna quit?
[312:42.44]No, stop sticking!
[312:43.30]That was a real bad shot.
[312:48.56]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[313:25.04]Nothing I can do.
[313:26.00]What?
[313:26.24]That kid's spray panning.
[313:28.18]Get an army.
[313:29.35]Kind of is this game.
[313:30.87]Well.
[313:31.11]I got it.
[313:57.47]You don't need to get the greens.
[314:01.75]Yeah, but they're extra points.
[314:13.87]That's the end of the stream, boys.
[314:16.02]No, it's not the end of the stream.
[314:18.06]We're not done.
[314:19.74]We might be done with this game.
[314:37.18]I need to go down.
[314:38.38]I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do here.
[314:42.28]No, I need to go up across.
[314:45.02]Holy shit.
[314:47.60]I want to get off of the rail.
[314:49.20]Like, you stopped gluing me to rails.
[314:53.22]It's like a ha- Okay, when I want to jump on a rail, it's like, nah, you didn't do it precise enough.
[314:57.72]When I want to get off a rail- No, you're a magnet.
[315:00.32]Get back here.
[315:07.65]Alright, I got 13.
[315:08.05]I'm an old player now.
[315:13.18]You're going here, lady.
[315:14.26]How the fuck did 15-year-old me play?
[315:41.91]No, I thought it took five.
[315:43.30]That was Jet Set Radio.
[316:04.17]It's a good game.
[316:05.95]It's just very, very difficult.
[316:14.12]very precise and you can't play it like tony hawk you have to pretend you're made out of wood and that your shoes have glue on them that's how you play it's a good game it's it's very interesting go back to flogging
[316:44.15]He's too salty.
[316:45.13]I'm not salty.
[316:46.63]I'm not.
[316:48.35]It's just, I think that has a lot of learning curve, and I don't want to sit there and play that all day.
[316:56.25]I'm not mad at that game.
[316:57.49]It's just, I've told you a thousand times it's a very good game.
[317:02.64]How do I get Space Channel 5 to work?
[317:15.64]How did you survive Crazy Taxi Learning Curve but not Jet Set Radio?
[317:21.03]Because.
[317:22.27]Fast car, go fast, and there's money involved.
[317:29.99]Alright, give me a second.
[317:31.63]I'm going to take one last break.
[317:33.77]We're going to come back, and I'm going to try Space Channel 5.
[317:40.27]I'm going to Google this in a minute.
[317:42.29]So I'll figure it out if we can even play it.
[317:43.65]If not, then... And we're not going back to Floygan Brothers.
[317:47.09]I might open Crazy Taxi again.
[317:49.85]Maybe.
[317:50.27]Because I'm addicted.
[317:53.36]I'll be right back.
[317:54.62]See if we can get it to work.
[321:10.83]Alright.
[321:12.73]I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get this to work.
[321:15.99]There's not very much literature on why this is not working.
[321:20.59]I went into Steam discussions and it's like, oh yeah, I don't know how to get it to work.
[321:23.33]I'm missing character models.
[321:25.26]I've restarted the game and it's fine.
[321:27.34]Like, uh... Doesn't really help me.
[321:37.45]Let me just try opening it again.
[321:50.88]Jeremiah I am here tuber.
[321:54.14]What do you do buddy?
[321:54.83]What is it?
[321:59.65]Yeah, yeah, no, you can't see it right now, but I'm just seeing if I can Maybe go to the changing rooms did not have to load a game.

[322:23.34]Her model is in the game.
[322:24.37]Let's see what happens.
[322:35.19]Let's see.
[322:36.89]Look, ready?
[322:41.27]She's clearly from character models here.
[322:49.28]So, if the character model is just there, why then can we not do it?
[322:54.81]I'm gonna try it again.
[323:09.31]Got it!
[323:09.93]Oh my god, finally!
[323:12.45]Holy shit, hold on.
[323:15.18]No, no, don't crash!
[323:16.22]Don't!

[323:35.41]This is my childhood game.
[323:44.90]The game's in Japanese.
[323:46.22]That's too late.
[323:49.00]There's no setting to turn it out of Japanese.
[323:52.24]Up, up, up.
[323:56.74]Got it.
[324:19.72]I gotta pay you close attention.
[324:21.06]Why are there no prompts on the screen?

[324:46.63]Is that the best you got?
[325:23.98]Where do you think I got the walk from, guys?
[325:27.44]Where do you think I fucking got that one from?
[325:30.98]Take a wild guess.
[325:34.02]It's the Neverhood, actually.
[325:35.20]The Neverhood.

[333:04.03]That's a good D. No secrets.
[333:05.53]Alright, now let me put it on English.
[333:31.13]How are you all doing?
[333:32.99]President, would you like to say something?
[334:02.66]It was in Japanese by default.
[334:15.91]Keep it in Japanese.
[334:18.82]No, I gotta put it in English.
[334:38.27]The graphics still hold up pretty well.
[334:39.41]Yeah, they kinda do.
[334:46.06]You need English?
[334:46.78]Some of the tricks this game can pull are brutal.
[334:54.15]Yeah.
[334:55.21]I'm ready.
[334:56.99]I'm ready to... Hey, you skipped that.
[334:59.01]You, like, made it out of wood and glue.
[335:00.55]I can't wait to make, like, a reference like that and then quit the game.
[335:09.40]Uh...
[335:26.15]Hey, Urala, get back here.
[335:57.80]It's not pirated.
[336:00.06]Is it in the other options?
[336:02.62]I'm terrified to close the game, though.
[336:07.96]Hold on, let me see.
[336:08.82]Let me try opening it again.
[336:19.83]Sorry, you just got that loud sound.
[336:23.49]Is it in the other menu, like the other options?
[336:28.33]So it is audio.
[336:30.81]Hey, guess what, guys?
[336:31.89]It's on voiceover in English is the voiceover.
[336:36.35]It's not on Japanese.
[336:37.43]It's on English.
[336:39.00]What happens if I put it in Japanese?
[336:43.90]I'm just going to put it on Japanese.
[336:59.71]It says it's English.
[337:01.67]Let's see.
[337:08.23]This is weird.
[337:16.58]Let me just make sure.
[337:17.88]Play game.

[337:38.04]I mean, we have English subtitles now.
[337:46.80]What?
[337:49.54]No, it isn't... What language is this?
[337:57.10]Any comment, Mr. President?
[337:58.26]English.
[337:58.56]Why, yes.
[338:00.06]Of course.
[338:01.34]Good.

[339:01.89]The audio's still low.
[339:05.33]Holy shit, I almost just clicked the stop streaming button because I clicked over here to turn this up.
[339:12.30]Give me a break.
[339:13.10]I almost just clicked it.
[339:14.10]It went right over it.
[339:16.44]Is that better?
[339:27.88]Perfect!
[339:29.86]Great Canadian Fuck Club just came in with 10 community subs.

[341:36.17]Guys, I cannot speak.
[341:37.41]This is gonna be a silent playthrough of this game.
[341:40.87]There's no way I can speak.
[341:42.15]I can't talk.
[341:44.13]What I was going to say is, SEGA has a shitload of interesting mascots and interesting characters.
[341:48.69]Where are they?
[341:53.41]Now, let that spin around in your brain for like another 30 minutes while I be quiet.
[341:57.08]Left, right, left, right, left, right.
[342:01.28]We save them mostly.
[342:18.18]Alright Try
[343:07.29]I don't remember.
[343:40.18]Hey.
[343:40.48]Hey.
[343:40.86]Very nice.
[344:10.23]down down
[344:31.89]I'm too tired for this, I think.
[344:33.29]I tried to do it the other way.
[344:36.31]Alright, bring it on.
[344:37.31]Hey, hey, hey!
[345:10.03]Stay tuned.
[345:12.57]I got 36%.
[345:13.77]We've reached about a square.
[345:16.70]You've got to beat the other reporters to the scoop.
[345:21.10]It's the hey and the choo and the up and the down and the da-da-down and the down-down and the left-right.
[345:25.76]Choo.
[345:26.62]Hey.
[345:28.33]Okay.
[345:29.09]What?
[345:31.47]Get your coverage from Channel 42.
[345:35.55]Pudding?
[345:36.07]Pudding?
[345:40.70]Oh, it's an Anchorman scenario.
[345:42.40]Are they gonna fight each other?
[345:44.11]Stunned.
[345:44.45]It's not just... What?
[346:11.50]Hold on a minute.
[346:16.49]Wait, so it's different directions, not just down.
[346:21.89]What?
[346:22.29]What direction am I supposed to be going in?
[346:47.73]Holy shit.
[346:48.47]I... What's just the right direction?
[347:32.39]Aren't you the clumsy one?
[347:38.49]Hey!
[347:39.69]Hey!
[348:18.08]This is insane.
[348:20.34]I can't handle this.
[348:22.42]Oh my god.
[348:23.44]This is fucking ridiculous.
[348:35.88]Let's keep going.
[348:36.54]How am I supposed to beat this?
[348:44.99]Oh, God.
[348:49.34]Let's shoot!
[349:19.87]I love this game.
[349:20.97]This is fantastic.
[349:50.91]Oh god, it's speeding up.
[349:54.13]No, not good.
[349:55.13]There's more birds, they're attacking!
[350:14.95]They're killing that guy.
[350:34.29]I wonder how insane this game gets.
[350:37.59]That guitar thing was hard.
[350:40.74]Just because... the glow, sometimes it was hard to tell if it was up or down or right.
[350:47.54]Up and right were like the same thing in my brain, and when she's like, down, down, d-d-d-d-down!
[350:50.74]Ugh.
[350:50.88]Stay.
[351:05.50]How high am I?
[351:06.30]I don't know.
[351:09.14]I don't know how high you are.
[351:11.46]It's enough for me to know.
[351:14.78]I can't fuck up again right now.
[351:19.39]Oh, ooh la la!
[351:21.37]Please save me!
[351:23.89]Please!
[351:25.47]Hurry, we'll change your ratings into stars!

[352:19.10]Oh, this is great
[353:04.73]Oh my god.

[354:04.67]What the hell am I playing?
[354:07.41]Uh, you came in at a strange time.

[355:53.58]What?
[355:53.84]Try again, ooh la la!
[356:04.95]What in the name of God was that?
[356:06.27]I have no idea why that happened.
[356:13.86]I'm using an Xbox controller, yes.
[356:27.19]Is that bad?
[356:55.96]Why not Dreamcast?
[356:57.00]Because this is not on Dreamcast.
[357:02.14]I have it on PC right now.
[357:28.55]I had it perfect up until like the guy was just going like and it wouldn't work.
[358:03.07]Here we go.
[358:55.50]I pressed it!
[358:56.02]What the fuck?
[358:58.24]Is this thing fucking up on me?
[358:59.76]I'd be so mad if this Xbox controller just sucked.
[359:02.26]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[359:05.30]Here we go.

[361:58.56]This is not the original Space Channel 5.
[362:03.36]This is a different version.
[362:04.48]The second one.
[362:07.65]Do one more level.
[362:08.49]I'm not leaving.
[362:10.99]I'm not in a blast.

[365:20.32]That's what I'm doing.
[365:35.34]Alright, something going on with when I hold it and then hit press it again.
[365:38.30]I don't know why.
[365:41.97]Because I'm letting it go and pressing it again.
[365:51.90]It's not that it doesn't register.
[365:53.04]Xbox sucks.
[365:53.72]It's pretty much where I need to sell you.
[366:00.78]Here we go.
[366:02.06]Come on.
[366:02.76]I'm sweating.
[366:04.43]Press down to hit the drum.
[366:52.78]I forgot I was playing a game and I forgot I was streaming.
[366:54.54]I forgot I was sitting in a chair.
[366:55.28]I forgot where I was.
[367:37.72]Ate!
[368:09.45]I thought I was going to get a second.
[368:49.93]This is too much fun.
[368:56.03]You really have to turn off your brain, but it's fun.
[368:58.57]Look out!
[369:03.79]Pine Bazookas incoming!
[369:13.20]It's another 60%.
[369:17.76]It's Michael Jackson.
[369:20.40]That's actually Michael Jackson.
[369:23.60]Michael Jackson is in this game.
[369:43.02]He actually did voice work for it.
[369:44.36]Wow.
[369:44.46]That probably costs a lot of money.
[370:11.58]He alone made the budget this game, like $30 million.
[370:13.92]I need this space transmitter to complete my grand plan.
[370:20.28]Soon enough, none of you will have a thing to worry about.
[370:25.75]He came to them.
[370:27.23]Wow.
[370:29.01]He must have really liked the first one.
[370:41.79]Do we get to play with Michael?
[370:43.69]Do we actually get to see Michael Jackson on camera?
[370:46.31]In this level?
[370:47.13]This is great.
[371:10.44]Oops, that's a fucking wrong thing.
[371:12.03]That's the wrong button.
[371:47.17]Wait, how did I do that wrong?
[371:48.36]That was wrong?
[371:51.77]What?
[372:19.96]What is Michael gonna think now?
[372:24.13]Oops.
[372:34.63]I have raw motor again.
[372:36.06]I got- hold on.
[372:36.66]You can't just fuck up.
[372:38.20]This is so fast.
[372:56.86]We're good.
[373:00.66]It's amazing how they go from this to Tetris Effect.
[373:08.75]That's really cool.
[373:29.46]Where are the Power Rangers?
[373:35.76]On board.
[373:36.16]Where are we dropping?
[373:36.94]I can't wait to see Space Michaels.

[390:49.06]You can't do that.
[390:50.34]What do you guys have to say?
[390:52.33]Oh, cool.
[391:21.11]come on come on
[391:44.52]Just do it again.
[391:52.11]Oh, fuck.
[391:53.21]Oh my goodness gracious, that was just too many things.
[392:30.76]You need to parry.
[392:44.11]I guess maybe playing through them a couple of times.
[392:47.01]You know, playing through more than twice.
[392:49.83]You can start to memorize things, but...
[392:58.77]No secrets.
[393:00.49]What happened to his face, Michael?
[393:07.22]Yeah, that's a really good question.
[393:16.22]The achievement, by the way, for that was who?
[393:19.56]H-O-O-O-O.
[393:21.40]For those of you gnomes in the chat that find that to be very interesting.
[393:26.34]In case anyone was wondering.
[393:29.27]now the real party starts the whole galaxy will dance for me well I haven't hit the wall yet so we're gonna keep going Michael's fine he's right here
[393:55.45]It's a weird level though.
[393:56.43]This is the vaporware level.
[393:58.43]The film grain is actually hurting my face, but it's alright.
[394:02.98]We got this.
[394:27.64]The whole crew is here.
[394:28.76]The entire Final Fantasy party.
[394:31.24]MRIs the poses.
[394:45.09]My fucking hands!
[394:46.13]My fucking hands!
[394:48.37]No, do it again.
[394:51.19]I slipped off.
[394:52.02]I slipped off the fucking controller.
[394:59.50]my hands we heard it through pines my hands I pressed it and it went and my grease covered finger flipped over we see something ahead what's that the reading on Persian the president points us in this direction that's not even a real problem it's time to take a break what I just slipped off my controller I want to
[395:29.11]No one restarted.
[395:30.77]It's not gonna happen again.
[395:36.62]I'm good to go, I'm fine.
[395:40.46]Down, left, right.
[395:43.10]Good.
[395:59.95]Yeah, that is Michael Jackson that you've just returned.
[397:11.25]What the fuck?
[397:13.65]Oh my goodness.
[397:26.13]It's the pattern that they come out in.
[397:28.41]Oh my fucking Jesus.
[397:29.75]I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna lose.
[397:33.63]Just get me out of that area.
[397:36.39]That sucked.
[397:47.16]The pauses take you out of the beat and make you have to like memorize what you just saw and heard.
[397:53.23]Like five seconds later and it's hard for your brain to do that.
[397:55.51]That's why it's intentional for them to put it like that.
[397:58.17]It's robots.
[398:00.19]Loads and loads and loads of robots.
[398:02.09]We're surrounded.
[398:06.12]Be careful.
[398:06.74]Everybody stick together.
[398:07.90]Alright.
[398:19.94]How come Michael doesn't say chew?
[398:44.04]Oh my god.
[398:44.80]I might need a break.
[398:46.40]That person was right.
[398:47.14]That person was right.
[398:47.98]I need a break.
[398:52.70]I have no idea what this is.
[399:03.54]What?
[399:05.19]How is that a girl?
[399:07.23]I gotta do the whole thing.
[399:14.99]Good evening, everybody.
[399:16.75]We heard it through Pine's broadcast.
[399:26.32]I can't skip this either.
[399:27.28]Come back another time to it?
[399:29.70]I probably will.
[399:30.02]This game is a lot of fun.
[399:31.68]Let me try it one more time.
[399:32.48]This is a very, very fun game.
[400:16.17]Play while you're drunk.
[400:17.09]That would be the worst mistake ever.
[400:19.82]No stars lost there.
[400:21.56]No stars have been lost.
[400:46.64]This is the hard one.
[400:47.44]Ah, damn it.
[400:48.28]No.
[400:48.46]I missed it already.
[400:50.66]I fucked it up already.
[400:54.94]Oh, this is hell trying to memorize it.
[401:03.26]Oh, god damn it.
[401:04.66]I couldn't get it.
[401:15.94]I was paying attention to the last three and then I blew it.
[401:19.13]Gonna go around in circles.
[401:46.10]I blinked and I missed the first one.
[401:48.33]I actually blinked and I fucking didn't
[402:12.04]Alright, let me pay attention to this one.
[402:14.54]It's just all the eyes on screen.
[402:18.48]Here we go.
[402:50.04]Oh my fucking lord.
[402:54.04]No!
[402:55.78]Oh my god.
[403:00.63]It's really not that big of a deal, it's just when they go past like an 8 or 9 sequence, like more than 7 or 8 in a sequence, it's like, god, you have to like memorize.
[403:21.64]What?
[403:22.26]How did I not- I pressed A!
[403:25.06]I pressed A when you were out.
[403:30.12]We take them mostly!
[403:57.81]Is that the midway point?
[403:59.19]Stay tuned.
[404:05.47]Alright, that's the midway point.
[404:06.89]I got it.
[404:07.65]We've come even deeper inside.
[404:09.78]Just where could Purge and the President be?
[404:11.80]Help!
[404:16.92]You won't be going any further if you don't understand no.
[404:29.62]What?
[404:30.07]Do I have to do this?
[405:06.60]You get it?
[405:07.30]Yeah.
[405:09.54]Right on.
[405:10.68]Oh, my God.
[405:11.63]Okay.
[405:12.27]Here we go.
[405:41.77]That's up.
[405:42.99]I thought that was hay.
[405:46.20]I thought it was hay.
[405:48.54]That's up.
[405:49.16]It's up.
[405:51.70]It's not B. We've come even deeper inside.
[406:10.50]It's BANG, not HEY!
[406:15.70]This one's not bad, I'll get it.
[406:17.06]Why have you never heard of this?
[406:24.57]Uh, I can't, sorry, I have both headphones on, I can't talk.
[406:27.43]Um, why have you never heard of this game?
[406:30.03]This game's very old.
[406:31.92]I think it was recently ported, but it's a very old game.
[406:36.58]It's very good, though.
[407:11.31]2011?
[407:11.33]I thought it was like 2014.
[407:12.65]I... How is that wrong?
[407:47.54]thought it was Michael's turn it wasn't Michael's turn that's still hey that's still the little guy I thought it was Michael huh let's give it another shot oh I thought it was Michael we've come even deeper inside just where could person the president be you won't be going any further
[408:15.42]I got it, but I pressed the wrong button after.
[408:25.25]Space Michael, when the guy has the microphone, is that really the way to work?
[408:29.36]Because he's bright.
[409:03.85]This is where I fuck it up every time.
[409:05.43]Let me figure out what I'm doing wrong here.
[409:37.11]Alright.
[409:37.87]Here we go.
[409:40.79]Bang, bang, bang.
[410:16.74]That doesn't sound right.
[410:54.78]Hey, hey.
[411:03.75]No!
[411:13.03]Oh, that was the last note, a gun.
[411:17.13]Oh, man.
[411:19.95]Was it hay or was it chew?
[411:21.33]Was it hay?
[411:22.07]It was that like... Was chew?
[411:22.91]I did chew.
[411:28.17]How did I boing that?
[411:29.58]I don't know.
[412:05.75]Yeah, that's Michael Jackson.
[412:08.99]Oh my goodness gracious.
[412:11.33]It's Crazy Taxi all over again.
[412:37.28]Here we go.
[412:40.70]Come on, don't Star Lost.
[413:40.40]I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
[413:41.64]Do it!
[414:12.59]I pressed the wrong button.
[414:25.28]Where am I?
[414:30.32]Couldn't you buy me just a little more time?
[414:33.34]You can't change back yet.
[414:39.84]Okay, Arnold for a game I think you can spot the real one.
[414:43.64]Oh shit The real one's different from the rest of them.
[414:48.54]No Let's see
[415:11.28]What?
[415:11.64]Huh?
[415:12.56]I'm... It's gotta get the gun.
[415:17.83]What?
[415:17.97]Uh, I... I just... I just... I just pressed hey.
[415:20.85]I did hey.
[415:40.53]I did up, hey, so you don't, you shoot the real one or you don't shoot the real one?
[415:47.95]Are you supposed to shoot the real one?
[415:52.66]I, I, okay, I did, I did press hey, that's what I did.
[416:00.24]So the middle one is the one that has to be shot, but how do you get, is it up?
[416:03.70]I'm confused.
[416:06.38]Don't shoot the real one.
[416:12.70]No, I understand that, like, hay is save and chew is attack, so you have to save the first two, shoot the middle one, save the next two.
[416:31.68]Save the real one.
[416:34.72]Okay.
[416:36.32]We're so far back here.
[416:43.89]To the opposite.
[416:48.89]No, you shoot the real one.
[416:51.00]Again, eat the berries or not eat the berries.
[416:53.22]Half of you guys are saying shoot the real one and half of you guys are saying save the real one.
[416:56.22]Half of you guys are doing it for fun, so I fuck it up on purpose.
[416:59.39]And the other half are trying to help me.
[417:00.75]It's very fun.
[417:21.77]Guess I'm gonna have to just figure it out.
[417:25.51]There we go.
[417:56.46]Oh, I didn't do it.
[418:05.61]We'll do it again tomorrow.
[418:10.60]We're gonna do it again tomorrow.
[418:17.71]I've been streaming for seven hours of these Dreamcast games.
[418:26.22]I'm going to start with that tomorrow.
[418:33.60]Two rage quits in one night?
[418:34.86]What was that?
[418:35.42]Oh, Jet Set Radio doesn't count.
[418:36.54]I put like 20 minutes into that game.
[418:43.29]What's the name of that?
[418:43.85]That's Space Channel 5 Part 2.
[418:45.07]It's on Steam.
[418:49.72]It is a port of a Dreamcast game, and it's very good.
[418:53.86]But... I'm going to come back fresh tomorrow and play it tomorrow.
[418:57.27]I'm going to beat it tomorrow.
[418:58.21]It's going to be fucking very fun.
[419:02.05]This game sucks?
[419:04.55]No.
[419:04.91]What are you talking about?
[419:13.07]What?
[419:19.18]How could you say that?
[419:19.96]That game is so charming and fun and interesting.
[419:23.42]But anyways, we'll pick it up tomorrow.
[419:27.62]I've been going for seven hours now.
[419:30.36]After the bits will probably be about eight hours or so, eight and a half.
[419:33.46]So it's getting late.
[419:35.90]It's like 1, almost 1.30 a.m.
[419:38.14]Eastern.
[419:39.58]It's time.
[419:40.30]You know, you got to know when it's time to take a break.
[419:42.12]Like that one guy said, it's time to take a break, man.
[419:44.80]And I said, yeah, you know what?
[419:45.66]You're right.
[419:46.68]Sometimes you just got to know.
[419:50.33]Crazy Taxi, fucking awesome game.
[419:52.34]Space Pit Channel 5, amazing game, ton of fun.
[419:55.36]Jet Set Radio, hard to learn, but if you sit down and give it the time necessary, about 10 to 20 hours, maybe 40 hours of time, you'll learn it, and it's a very good game.
[420:05.22]I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
[420:06.18]These are all in the Dreamcast collection.
[420:07.62]When am I going to play Seaman?
[420:14.46]When I get it reshipped.
[420:18.66]Because it got shipped to me with the microphone missing, so I couldn't play it.
[420:24.14]So I returned it.
[420:24.78]And now I have to get another one.
[420:30.46]But that's going to wrap it up for tonight.
[420:33.76]I really want to finish Space Jam.
[420:35.84]I'm so into it right now.
[420:38.80]But there's only so many chews instead of haze that you can fuck up before you realize it's time to go get food.
[420:46.37]And do it again tomorrow.
[420:50.23]I had a lot of fun.
[420:50.95]As always, it was a blast.
[420:51.83]Thanks for sticking around.
[420:53.87]We're going to move on to the bits.
[420:55.39]I'll see you guys tomorrow for Space Channel 5 Part 2.
[421:00.27]And then after that, it's kind of up in the air after that.
[421:04.60]Because that was kind of the end of the Dreamcast stuff.
[421:12.54]But I'm looking forward to beating Space Channel.
[421:18.43]Space Channel 5 Part 2 Part 2.
[421:20.13]That would be the title of the stream.
[421:24.63]But as always, you guys rock.
[421:26.96]Thank you so much for sticking around.
[421:28.66]Here comes the outro.
[421:31.52]He rage quit.
[421:32.26]I didn't rage quit anything.
[421:33.18]I didn't rage quit.
[421:35.79]I... I just simply quit the game and put the controller down very, very hard.
[421:42.86]and air exhaled out of my nose very fast.
[421:46.98]That's not a rage quit, that is I ended the session of the game I was playing and I'm gonna come back and do it again tomorrow.
[421:56.57]With a little bit of rage, you might say?
[421:58.13]No, no, I wouldn't say that.
[422:00.03]I would say with a slight discomfort level.
[422:05.78]Hey, is it a rage quit?
[422:06.98]That's not a rage quit because I'm coming back and playing it tomorrow.
[422:11.17]Wouldn't a proper rage quit be that I'm not going to ever play it again?
[422:15.31]And fuck this game.
[422:16.73]Did you ever hear me say fuck this game?
[422:19.32]Mm-mm.
[422:21.46]I just simply am stopping my session.
[422:22.92]I'm going to pick it up tomorrow.
[422:30.46]But let's move back in time here to about seven and a half hours ago.
[422:33.88]Or seven hours ago at just about.
[422:36.64]See?
[422:36.88]Oh, shirts!
[422:37.50]The shirts!
[422:38.04]The shirts.
[422:38.40]Alright, I forgot to mention again.
[422:40.98]Shirts are now available.
[422:42.42]Glue Man is back.
[422:44.30]Permanently.
[422:45.66]And the Night Sky is the new shirt that is back.
[422:49.52]Not back, it's here.
[422:52.17]If you do exclamation point shirts, you will see it.
[422:54.81]You'll find it.
[422:55.33]There's a new cut for the Glue Man shirt as well.
[423:04.45]Hope you enjoy them.
[423:05.07]I hope they turn out very good.
[423:10.88]Because I love them.
[423:11.62]I think they're great.
[423:12.90]Ashley did a fantastic job, so... Kudos to Ashley.
[423:20.27]And with that, let's go over to the bits.
[423:21.43]So, seven hours ago, Krusty Earwax, thanks for $1.
[423:23.99]Glad to see you're okay.
[423:24.81]I thought you got arrested.
[423:27.59]I did not get arrested.
[423:29.59]That didn't happen.
[423:31.01]But thank you for the $1.
[423:31.89]Thank you, Alec, for the $1.
[423:33.03]Why does the resolution look like a 2007 Blackberry crossed with an Apple II?
[423:39.67]Well, this came out before iPhones even existed, so the iPhone has... Apple II has the graphics of the Dreamcast.
[423:49.08]You know, they copied the Dreamcast.
[423:51.04]2007 Blackberry.
[423:51.54]What do you think they got the idea from?
[423:57.76]But thank you, Yen Win, for the $1.
[424:00.51]Fun fact, I'm not actually a professional artist.
[424:02.29]I just like to draw in my free time.
[424:04.61]This time I have drawn a portrait of you in Shito.
[424:09.17]Uh, once again, I prefer to just keep the link to the high-res image.
[424:13.39]Okay.
[424:15.07]If only I keep the link to the- Okay, I see.
[424:21.09]I look forward to watching your reaction when you- when I wake up.
[424:23.97]Alright, cool.
[424:24.41]Let's see.
[424:28.67]I- I- There's no way that you just draw on your free time.
[424:31.75]This is- This is so good that, like, you- Like, no way.
[424:35.71]That's unbelievable.
[424:40.27]Just draw on my free- This is like some of the most talented artwork I've ever seen.
[424:46.09]So, if you just draw kind of in your free time for fun, you got quite the gift.
[424:50.27]That's fucking unbelievable.
[424:52.48]Uh, I'm gonna download it and just put it on stream.
[424:58.88]Let me just get it on the stream.
[425:00.90]Because, uh, per their wishes, I don't- I'm not gonna give the high-resolution download link.
[425:07.27]It's their request.
[425:10.87]So I'll get it on the screen here.
[425:13.18]Take a look at this.
[425:23.63]This is unbelievable.
[425:25.29]It's like looking into a mirror.
[425:38.22]Let's see.
[425:47.05]It's ridiculous.
[425:49.51]This is extremely high res.
[425:58.71]That is truly amazing.
[426:05.30]Well... Thank you so much for this.
[426:08.70]This is... Look at that face.
[426:13.05]Even the eyes.
[426:13.75]The eyes are just perfect.
[426:15.97]The eyes are perfect.
[426:21.70]The mouth.
[426:24.28]How are people this talented?
[426:27.90]Remember I told you about the aliens that possess people to, like, beat Crazy Taxi in, like, 30 minutes?
[426:33.01]Beat the whole thing, get S-plus on every single exact everything?
[426:39.45]That works in a lot of different places, I think.
[426:48.41]You got skill, you got talent.
[426:49.51]Great work.
[426:50.74]Absolutely excellent work.
[426:54.66]Thank you so much for that, Yen Win.
[426:56.92]Yen Win Lin.
[427:02.50]And thank you for the $1 as well.
[427:05.79]Thank you, SomeGuy, for the $15.
[427:07.41]So, funny story.
[427:09.17]I didn't actually mean to post the Phantom of the Opera Overture twice.
[427:13.05]In fact, I don't even think it was my intent to post it once.
[427:16.65]But anyway, here's another video.
[427:18.89]Thank you for $15 and... Take a closer look at that snout!
[427:30.96]That's Phantom of the Opera again.
[427:34.12]It's... a mouse-rat thing.
[427:39.37]I don't know what this is.
[427:43.27]But it's very clearly Phantom of the Opera.
[427:46.45]So thank you, Someguy, for the $15.
[427:47.95]And the Phantom of the Opera.
[427:53.13]Hey, Father Frogman, thanks for the $1.
[427:54.32]Whoa, Jeremy, great stream.
[427:55.78]Love, Grandpa.
[427:57.82]Everybody loves Grandpa.
[428:00.48]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam, for the $1.
[428:01.54]So how's the comb stream talk to chat stream idea coming along?
[428:06.35]The classic comb streams where you just sit in front of the camera and talk are some real comedy Jerma moments, and I'd love to see it become more of a regular thing.
[428:16.23]Yeah, I've thought about it before, but here's the thing about stuff like that, right?
[428:24.32]it's everything you've ever seen me do like on like the irl streams just kind of happened right it wasn't like here I'm gonna plan this and I'm gonna do that and here we go this is the thing I'm gonna do as a bit today we kind of just sit there and it just happens so I don't know planning out irl streams in particular I don't know if I if it's a good idea anymore I feel like they naturally will just happen when they need to and when they will
[428:56.45]I feel the same way about a lot of different other pieces of content, right?
[429:01.94]Stuff just kind of naturally has to happen.
[429:05.30]And putting myself on like a once a week or once every, oh, it's the comb stream.
[429:09.24]Here we go.
[429:10.02]Here comes the comedy.
[429:11.64]Like, here it comes.
[429:13.45]That's not going to really work because that's not how I operate.
[429:18.67]So just stream yourself sleeping.
[429:26.91]You can't do that on Twitch.
[429:28.08]You get banned.
[429:33.78]I mean, some of the most fun moments I've ever had on this stream came from things that I didn't even know was going to happen until 10 seconds before they happened.
[429:44.36]I mean, take that as you will, I guess, but that's sort of how it works.
[429:54.41]Can't wait for the next funny Friday.
[430:02.67]Like accidentally being naked.
[430:04.33]Yeah, that was a funny planned thing.
[430:06.21]That was a pretend.
[430:08.29]Everybody knows that.
[430:11.43]But thank you, TimmyTimTam.
[430:12.27]Thank you, C4G, for the $1.
[430:13.27]And they say, please give us pins of jermaJex.
[430:21.14]Teespring does not just do t-shirts anymore.
[430:24.00]I think I can make phone cases, wallets, keys.
[430:29.21]Well, you know, you get the idea.
[430:36.44]Socks.
[430:37.30]Pikachu socks.
[430:39.39]Whale plushies.
[430:40.21]You know, there's all this, plenty of options.
[430:45.57]So that storefront, if you notice, if you go to like the store, teespring.com slash stores, the Jerma985.
[430:52.45]It's all just there.
[430:53.87]So any other pieces of merchandise that I want to do through Teespring will just go up on that storefront.
[431:00.00]Those shirts aren't coming down.
[431:03.00]Things will just be added over time.
[431:12.29]And if it's out of the wheelhouse of Teespring and it's something else that I want to do, then I'll put it somewhere else, right?
[431:21.92]But thank you, Lazy Luke, for the $1.
[431:23.42]I will spend all my money of my bank account for the Night Sky shirt.
[431:29.22]Well, I hope you don't spend all your money in your bank account.
[431:32.80]If you have enough money to buy that shirt and it's something that you want and you think you're going to wear it,
[431:38.31]And by all means.
[431:39.73]But I really don't... I really hope you don't clear out your bank account to buy that shirt.
[431:43.87]It'll be around for a long time.
[431:45.13]You've got plenty of time to do it.
[431:50.48]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.
[431:51.86]Saturn is popular.
[431:52.78]Chat will spam jermaSaturn now.
[431:54.44]Just watch.
[431:55.78]Well, somebody mentioned they might be on Saturn.
[431:59.72]So, that's the ultimate part of that t-shirt.
[432:02.28]Because you are Saturn.
[432:03.72]They're standing on you.
[432:05.10]Which is Saturn.
[432:06.38]Or Mercury, depending.
[432:11.16]Thank you Ike Turtle for the $1.
[432:12.44]Yo, I got a question about that shirt.
[432:14.42]Why are we just spying on this family through a telescope?
[432:19.41]These are questions that I don't have an answer to.
[432:23.61]Thank you Todd for the $1.
[432:25.07]Hey, hey, it's time for some crazy taxi.
[432:31.78]Thank you Demonic Cucumber for the $1.
[432:34.66]Hey, Etalyx.
[432:35.18]I know the reason why you didn't stream yesterday, because you were busy cremating the late Jerma.
[432:39.20]I guess Shito hasn't appeared because he can't handle the grief.
[432:41.46]Anyway, Jerma would have made a spill joke by now.
[432:44.36]Just a heads up.
[432:52.23]Thank you, Marvash Magali, for the $1 petition to make an egg t-shirt next.
[432:56.61]Also, a reminder for chat that this video exists.
[433:01.55]What video exists?
[433:05.39]This is, uh... This is Bird Boy puking.
[433:12.07]There's a video on my channel of one of my friends throwing up on camera.
[433:16.00]Because he's laughing so hard at a game.
[433:17.84]That's one of my favorite videos, by the way.
[433:23.58]This is one of my favorite videos on my whole channel.
[433:25.79]Did you just seriously puke?
[433:29.85]Yep.
[433:55.51]This is it.
[433:55.89]It's like a house.
[433:57.97]Oh, the memories.
[434:00.01]Good old YouTube 2012.
[434:02.51]Burger Boy puking on webcam.
[434:06.53]So, yeah, there it is.
[434:10.66]I have so much vivid moments.
[434:12.02]Vivid memories of that exact video.
[434:19.35]We were laughing so hard.
[434:21.91]He just threw up.
[434:25.85]He was drinking something out of, like, a big baby cup, too.
[434:30.94]I have no idea.
[434:31.60]He was drinking, like, booze or something.
[434:34.88]But anyways, thank you, Marvash Magali.
[434:38.21]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[434:39.57]Also, is the shirt edible?
[434:43.65]What shirt?
[434:44.03]The shirt?
[434:44.25]What shirt?
[434:46.66]Like, my shirts?
[434:48.46]They're made out of the most premium material.
[434:50.65]You wouldn't want to eat those.
[434:53.95]Hey, Divas, thanks for the two bucks, Divas.
[434:56.21]Dork Cube, thanks for the one dollar.
[434:58.41]All these screaming punk singers in extremely dangerous driving reminds me of when my sister got her license.
[435:07.40]Punk singers.
[435:10.96]Anything is edible at least once.
[435:13.12]Well...
[435:15.36]I mean, could you eat that shirt?
[435:17.94]You could.
[435:19.86]It would be incredibly ill-advised.
[435:22.48]That would be a very bad idea.
[435:24.27]You would get sick, something bad.
[435:25.67]You'd get like a blockage in your intestine.
[435:27.87]You shouldn't do that.
[435:29.11]Do not do that.
[435:29.87]It technically is you could, but do not do it.
[435:44.89]I'm gonna eat it.
[435:45.71]I didn't tell you to.
[435:46.39]I'm telling you right now, do not do that.
[435:49.37]Absolutely do not consume that shirt.
[435:52.31]Wear it.
[435:55.12]Run from it.
[436:03.98]Thank you, DoorCube.
[436:05.30]Again, for the $1.00.
[436:08.80]Uh, Fat Fartmaster.
[436:11.10]Okay, never mind.
[436:14.02]Thank you Jebediah for the $10.
[436:15.48]You ever going to post on the main channel again?
[436:19.59]I have no plan to.
[436:24.39]We've gone over it more than a dozen times at this point.
[436:29.41]Probably not.
[436:31.52]That channel is going to stay there.
[436:32.70]It's never going to come down.
[436:34.10]But in the current landscape of how
[436:39.04]things work right now on Twitch, I don't have time to make a video.
[436:43.84]I really don't.
[436:46.06]Streaming, I used to make a video once a week.
[436:50.10]But now, instead of making a video that takes me four days to make, you know, four or five days to make it, or come up with an idea, now I just stream four days a week.
[437:04.36]Sometimes less, sometimes more.
[437:12.83]And I'm not going to just make a video because I have to.
[437:17.19]If that makes any sense.
[437:19.39]I'm not going to just be like, I gotta make a video, I have to.
[437:21.75]Because then that's not why I wanted to make a video in the first place.
[437:28.35]I will never phone in a stream.
[437:29.80]I will never phone in a video.
[437:31.60]I just, I don't want to.
[437:32.94]That's not why I want to do it.
[437:35.42]So, hey, you gotta make a new video on the main channel.
[437:37.48]It's like, I... But I don't.
[437:40.92]Because...
[437:42.98]Going back and trying to do a video just because I have to do a video.
[437:49.47]That's not going to happen.
[437:51.99]The magic will not be there.
[437:53.45]It just won't feel fun.
[437:55.83]It won't be something I'm interested in currently.
[437:58.87]All of my interests right now are on trying to make live stuff.
[438:05.46]And obviously since the move to Vegas, you've already seen a handful of streams that have taken a lot more time to make.
[438:13.53]And, like I said, once every, like, 30 to 40 days, you're gonna see something else.
[438:18.31]It just depends on exactly what I want to do.
[438:19.91]But that is the new interest and the new thing that I want to try.
[438:24.31]I don't know what you could upload that people won't be upset about at this point.
[438:34.66]Yeah, there's... There are a million reasons why.
[438:43.09]But I'm not going to just do it.
[438:47.45]If I get the urge and it's like something that I want to do.
[438:49.61]And hey, this would be great as a YouTube video.
[438:53.39]Maybe I'll work on it and try to put it up.
[438:55.05]And now obviously we'd talk about it.
[438:56.37]But I want to try to transition to more experience.
[439:02.27]Live experience based content.
[439:05.92]Because it's fun.
[439:16.83]And it has to be, it's a natural progression, right?
[439:18.55]Because you, we talked about it literally 20 minutes ago, not even.
[439:27.33]I, I, I need to be interested.
[439:30.03]I have to be.
[439:30.91]It's just not, it's not something that I can do.
[439:35.33]I'm not capable of putting a face on and uploading a video because I want to.
[439:41.04]Nope.
[439:43.30]But I'm sorry that a lot of people don't want to hear that.
[439:48.26]But I'm not going to lie to everybody and be like, just wait six more months and there'll be Jerma Rumble 2.
[439:55.80]Jerma Rumble Live 2 is going to be a live broadcast.
[440:00.58]Actually on Twitch.
[440:01.33]That's what I want to do.
[440:03.89]No one's ever done something like that before.
[440:05.21]No one's ever tried to do something like that, I don't think.
[440:08.11]And neither have I. That's something I've never tried to attempt before.
[440:11.91]So I've slowly been trying to do more live showy type stuff.
[440:19.85]to test the waters to see how possible I think it is.
[440:25.27]The WWE, yeah, I mean the WWE has like a thousand employees.
[440:28.79]I'm talking about like eight people with like 20 actors.
[440:40.94]And people maybe with something with extensions.
[440:46.02]could like vote on who could get eliminated or maybe you could vote on who comes in next stuff like that is what interests me right now and over the few months coming years that I want to try to level up to that and right now it's a lot of meeting people checking out studios talking to the right people getting the right position where it's something I could do
[441:17.53]And so far I think I'm on the right path.
[441:25.11]We'll see.
[441:27.03]But hopefully that answers your question.
[441:31.13]Thank you, Peter, for the $3.85.
[441:32.54]I had your stream audio for Crazy Taxi playing during my drive home.
[441:37.38]I'll just say that the honking, tire screeching, and screaming made for a great 4D driving experience.
[441:45.22]Oh, Jesus.
[441:49.70]Uh, make sure the volume is at a level where you're not going to get confused.
[441:57.40]Be careful.
[441:57.98]Make sure you're driving safely and you can pay attention to all your surroundings.
[442:04.73]Oh my god.
[442:05.49]Well, thank you, Peter.
[442:13.03]Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[442:14.71]They redid the entire Let It Go song from Frozen in Kingdom Hearts 3.
[442:20.77]Only difference is Sora, Donald, and Goofy are sitting in the background and it's hilarious.
[442:27.05]I can't play this on stream, I'll go to jail.
[442:41.80]Oh, by the way, an idea that I had for Jerma Rumble Live.
[442:45.81]You guys might think this is funny because it's pretty relevant.
[442:48.49]I didn't want to go to jail though.
[442:50.49]It was going to just start snowing and this was going to play and Elsa was going to come out.
[442:57.87]The snow was going to just start falling onto the ring and Elsa was going to be like a contestant.
[443:01.91]Everyone was going to stop and like look.
[443:04.87]Don't worry, I got fucking a million tricks up my sleeve.
[443:06.55]You don't even know about some of the other ones.
[443:12.53]That was like a bad, not funny version of like 30 other contestants.
[443:17.67]So don't worry.
[443:20.65]I got an entire Jerma Rumble Live 2, 3, and 4.
[443:25.66]Upstairs.
[443:28.00]But I ain't going to jail.
[443:28.96]So I can't play that whole video.
[443:30.00]Thank you.
[443:31.82]Bro luck, thanks for the $5.
[443:33.16]That is not how you drive a taxi.
[443:35.32]It is how you do it in Crazy Taxi.
[443:42.01]Hey, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[443:43.60]I'm starting to have serious doubts in my theory that Etalyx is doing the streams now because only Jeremy could come up with something as batshit crazy as skin aliens in possession by gamer powers.
[443:53.49]Guess it must have been in his mad ramblings before he died.
[444:00.15]There are a few different theories as to how people are so good at video games.
[444:04.11]Theory one, alien gamers possession spirits.
[444:07.50]Theory two, highly skilled video game players see the world at .98 speed.
[444:16.40]We've already talked about that one.
[444:19.08]I'm convinced.
[444:21.38]You just, you have that edge.
[444:23.66]You see the world in like 0.97.
[444:25.41]Not slow enough to really have it be a superpower, but slow enough where you have like an edge.
[444:42.20]Somebody should test it.
[444:49.36]0.98 is now 0.97.
[444:52.02]0.97 ratio.
[444:52.80]Fighting game players, yeah.
[444:56.84]It's like, it's like trying to catch a fly in the air.
[445:01.93]You have to see the world at like 0.96.
[445:06.93]It's not, humans can't do that.
[445:09.35]Unless you have the superpower that lets you slow down time permanently by just a tiny bit.
[445:16.24]And then they grab the fly.
[445:17.22]And it's like, holy, no, people can't do that.
[445:18.56]You must have fucking powers.
[445:22.23]You can train reflexes with practice.
[445:28.67]You could probably bring it down to like 0.99.
[445:29.99]I don't know about 0.98 or 0.97 though.
[445:37.64]Do you see the world at 1.02?
[445:39.52]Probably.
[445:42.34]I bet I see the world like 0.
[445:43.42]I probably see the world at 1.14.
[445:56.26]I want to test this theory one day.
[445:57.72]I want to like clap at the same time or like try to grab something and see what the... Aren't there apps and games that do this?
[446:07.04]There's like a click when the... There's a click when it's a green light, right?
[446:10.13]Isn't that a game?
[446:11.73]And you can see how fast your reaction is?
[446:17.91]I'll have to do that next stream.
[446:23.01]It's a reaction test.
[446:25.46]Yeah, we're going to do that next stream.
[446:27.46]I can't do it now.
[446:28.34]I've got gamer fatigue.
[446:31.12]It won't be an accurate representation of my skills.
[446:43.50]But anyways.
[446:45.76]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[446:48.70]Thank you, Jess, for the $1.
[446:49.96]Hey, Jerem, you're not becoming a mutant boomer who hates everything.
[446:52.28]Not yet, at least.
[446:52.94]Here's my parting gift.
[447:01.31]Nobody actually likes this game, do they?
[447:03.17]I'm kidding.
[447:19.78]I'm kidding.
[447:20.58]I love Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.
[447:24.08]I'm just kidding.
[447:25.10]It's a joke, guys.
[447:26.85]It's just a joke.
[447:28.57]I've loved going to the movie theater and watching seven movies in a row and then swinging a sword around for five seconds.
[447:38.64]And then going back in the theater and watching like six more movies.
[447:48.58]Was it like 16 hours of cutscenes in that game?
[448:00.34]Metal Gear Solid 4.
[448:02.10]I think Metal Gear has less cutscenes.
[448:03.34]Let's figure it out.
[448:04.06]Let's find out.
[448:06.36]What has more cutscenes across the whole franchise?
[448:09.10]Metal Gear, Solid, or Kingdom Hearts?
[448:20.30]I think Kingdom Hearts 2 has like 14 hours of cutscenes.
[448:24.16]Metal Gear?
[448:27.02]Metal Gear has like 100 hours of cutscenes.
[448:34.26]Metal Gear Solid 4 has 74, 71 minutes.
[448:38.33]Is that, no, that's not real.
[448:41.63]It's got seven games.
[448:48.33]And then you called me an idiot.
[448:51.35]How dare you.
[449:00.97]Kingdom Hearts 3 actually has a fictional Square Enix anime bullshit game inside the universe of Toy Story.
[449:14.27]But here's the thing.
[449:15.17]Kingdom Hearts, right?
[449:17.15]Kingdom Hearts was a really great idea.
[449:21.01]Really great games.
[449:22.00]They are very good games.
[449:24.84]They're incredibly detailed.
[449:25.88]There's a lot to do.
[449:26.64]There's a lot to see.
[449:27.88]They brought together all the Disney worlds.
[449:30.65]And it was, you could go to Jack Skellington.
[449:33.17]And then from there, you could go to Winnie the Pooh.
[449:34.77]It was like the biggest Infinity War crossover event in history for video games.
[449:40.38]It just was.
[449:42.95]And then they came up with the second one.
[449:44.79]And they even added more.
[449:45.87]There was more to do.
[449:46.43]There was more to see.
[449:47.17]Oh, that's awesome.
[449:48.01]Cool.
[449:48.75]And then the second one, and even in the end of the first one, they kind of just said, hey, instead of it being about like Disney characters and, you know, being like a good person and Kingdom Hearts, there's a door.
[449:59.62]They went so far off the rails.
[450:03.74]To a point where there's so much random shit going on that...
[450:10.58]It's almost like they have nine movies playing at the same time.
[450:15.21]Pausing four of them halfway through, letting the other five play, pausing those, going back and letting the other four play for like two hours, and then turning them all off.
[450:29.28]The game came out like, what, 13, 14 years later.
[450:33.94]There were like a bunch of other random games in the middle.
[450:36.60]There was like a DS, like Game Boy Advance games that were part of the story.
[450:41.53]They had to, like, catch people up.
[450:42.75]It's like, there's a lot going on.
[450:50.40]And they're all canon.
[450:52.42]Wow.
[450:59.59]But that's what I mean.
[451:00.07]They got, like, movies from a decade ago playing in the background for you.
[451:03.92]While you have the current movie playing in front of you.
[451:11.48]The problem with Kingdom Hearts is they released a shit ton of games on handhelds, but didn't actually tell you they were part of the story.
[451:22.77]But jokes aside, if you like Kingdom Hearts and you were excited for it, then that's great.
[451:29.05]That's awesome.
[451:29.98]Because, let's be real about it, they actually finished their fucking story.
[451:37.44]They actually did it.
[451:38.10]It took them a long time, but they did it.
[451:40.08]They announced it, and here it is, and it's done.
[451:42.52]I can name you a couple of companies that have not done that.
[451:45.38]That everybody really wishes they did.
[451:47.02]What do you mean, no, they didn't?
[451:54.78]Kingdom Hearts 3 is not the end.
[452:01.06]Wait, Kingdom Hearts 3 is not the end of Kingdom Hearts.
[452:06.39]Oh, don't spoil anything.
[452:07.71]Hold on.
[452:08.01]Wait, what?
[452:09.57]Well, whatever.
[452:10.25]They... My whole point is completely moot here, though.
[452:16.12]Just a bit... Yeah, but this... That's like saying Half-Life 3 never came out, but it didn't.
[452:21.30]But if Half-Life 3 came out, maybe there would be more Half-Life games, like offshoots and... Kingdom Hearts 1, 2, 3, done.
[452:28.61]That storyline is done.
[452:30.37]They did it.
[452:38.91]But regardless, I don't want to, like, rain on anybody's parade for liking Kingdom Hearts.
[452:46.11]Because I do.
[452:46.89]I think it's good.
[452:48.53]I played the shit out of those games.
[452:49.77]The first two.
[452:50.27]I'll probably end up playing the third one.
[452:55.12]But there's a lot of strange things going on in that series.
[453:00.56]And it kind of bounces all over the place.
[453:08.39]To a point where it has gotten to Metal Gear level of... What is that?
[453:12.84]Who is that?
[453:13.86]Why is that?
[453:16.02]And in my opinion, I don't know if you should be making... I don't know if you should be making those statements during a Disney game.
[453:22.10]Why is that?
[453:22.96]Who is that?
[453:24.28]Where is that?
[453:27.18]Donald Duck is... Donald Duck is just hanging out in the background.
[453:36.73]I got a Coca-Cola right here.
[453:45.38]I got a Pepsi it's not even whatever I need to hydrate that's not water but I'll probably play it I will probably play it uh
[454:06.52]By the way, I just realized what happened there.
[454:09.52]So, um... I got a one dollar from Jess who said, You're not becoming a mutant boomer who hates everything.
[454:15.74]And you linked... The kingdom... That's... Then I went off on... Kingdom Hearts.
[454:22.65]So you just played me like an absolute fiddle here.
[454:29.31]That was very well done.
[454:31.29]Very well done.
[454:34.95]Uh, thank you...
[454:37.63]Uh, fuck, I can't, my brain.
[454:40.93]Thank you, Phylactery.
[454:42.95]Phylactery, for the $15.
[454:44.67]Jerma, you're so handsome, I have to be careful not to watch your stream when my girlfriend's around.
[454:50.01]Take this money to appease your rugged good looks.
[454:56.89]Thank you.
[454:57.17]Appreciate it.
[455:03.14]Metal Gear's story is just as bad.
[455:05.22]Don't kid yourself, chat.
[455:10.50]Uh-oh.
[455:10.84]Kingdom Hearts story versus Metal Gear story.
[455:15.40]Which one did you quit halfway through because you went... Oh, please.
[455:19.96]Uh-oh.
[455:31.25]Both of them?
[455:40.02]Metal Gear is fine until 4.
[455:43.98]Metal Gear 3 is... Well, I mean, you got it at 3, is then 5, and then 5 is then the beginning of 1, and then 1 is then 2, and then 2 is then 4.
[455:53.17]And then 2 actually is not even in... It's like, it's based on a whole nother storyline.
[456:09.16]Then there's, in the middle of five, you got the Michael Jackson hee-hee.
[456:15.00]Except it's more of a ha-ha.
[456:18.76]Right?
[456:30.19]Eh, close enough.
[456:39.64]What a great sound effect, by the way.
[456:44.94]When you smoke that cigar, it's, that's, I love that part of that game.
[456:47.75]I love, that game's a great game.
[456:50.61]Can we talk about good games?
[456:53.63]Metal Gear Solid V is good.
[457:03.63]Anyway, SaranRaps, thanks for the three bucks.
[457:05.25]It'd be great to see Evo search for Eden on a future stream.
[457:08.16]It's a childhood favorite of mine and kind of like Seventh Cross was good.
[457:13.14]Much love.
[457:16.20]Thank you, SaranRaps.
[457:18.49]And I'll type it into Google and I'll see what the hell it is.
[457:23.35]You're playing Metal Gear Solid 3 for the first time.
[457:25.05]That is... I think that's probably my favorite one.
[457:29.50]In fact, Metal Gear Solid 3 is probably the only one that I would go back and play again.
[457:35.39]Is that strange?
[457:44.39]Hmm.
[457:46.94]The first two were very classic pieces of cinema, right?
[457:52.82]Video game cinema.
[457:55.80]But gameplay-wise, I think I'd rather go back and play 3 more than any of them.
[458:06.53]Here's the thing about 4.
[458:07.47]I have not played 4.
[458:10.38]I tried to start 4, but I just ran out of time, ran out of... It didn't grab me, and I stopped playing it.
[458:24.13]Four is good, but it's too long for replays.
[458:28.74]Yeah, I think Metal Gear Solid 3 sits somewhere right in the perfect little place for length, gameplay, storyline, cutscenes.
[458:39.13]I love the boss encounters.
[458:40.53]I love the... I'm not going to spoil anything because I don't know who's played it.
[458:44.66]But the different the.
[458:47.24]The different thes is great.
[458:50.44]I just love that.
[458:52.44]It's got a... I can't really say anything, but you know what I'm talking about.
[459:02.51]Maybe I will go back and play 3 again.
[459:05.63]Great game.
[459:09.27]The... The existence of the Cobra unit isn't exactly a spoiler.
[459:15.87]No.
[459:18.03]But a couple of those characters, you really... If somebody was going to play through for the first time ever, I'm not sure you'd want to start saying some of those names.
[459:27.94]Because, you know...
[459:30.82]Thank you, Hero of Trainses, for the $1.
[459:33.78]Hey, Jerm, a longtime fan here.
[459:36.00]Just want to say that Sonic Adventure DX needs its own stream.
[459:39.28]It actually has a story as opposed to some of these arcade games.
[459:44.51]Space Channel 5 has a story.
[459:49.07]And Michael Jackson's in that one.
[459:52.46]So we've got to go back and beat that one.
[460:00.56]They scream their names throughout the game.
[460:06.45]Oh, I forgot about some of those characters.
[460:10.03]They're so good.
[460:12.79]Oh, I'm just gushing about Metal Gear Solid 3.
[460:21.90]But Sonic was a fun game.
[460:24.56]I did not like it.
[460:27.59]I'm just not into the whole story, like, Sonic world.
[460:31.62]Sonic the game, I love.
[460:33.24]Sonic the world and Sonic the characters, I really am not, it doesn't, it doesn't really do much for me.
[460:40.28]Sonic the video game is phenomenal.
[460:43.43]But in my opinion, I'm not a big, like, huge fan of the Sonic world.
[460:56.21]Dirty Margaret, thanks for the $10.
[460:57.89]This music is pleasing.
[461:00.43]I'm not sure what you're referring to, but maybe you're talking about the music from Crazy Taxi.
[461:07.85]Dork Cube, thanks for the $1.
[461:08.99]How much of Sonic 06 have you seen?
[461:10.71]Because if you haven't seen much, I would suggest you play it for a laugh.
[461:14.41]Well, actually, the chat will be laughing.
[461:15.77]You'll be full of rage trying not to throw the controller at the screen.
[461:20.66]Uh, Sonic 06, I have seen it played.
[461:23.73]I have played pieces of it.
[461:28.15]That's the one where there's... Elsa's in that game, right?
[461:31.95]You're in, like, the weird human world.
[461:34.89]And there's all those weird cutscenes where you... Yes.
[461:42.32]So I'm thinking of the right game.
[461:45.84]I don't remember much.
[461:47.64]I didn't get very far.
[461:52.17]And I made a lot of people very angry at the beginning of this stream.
[461:57.75]Oh, this game sucks, right?
[461:58.93]Sonic Adventure.
[461:59.84]This one is a terrible one.
[462:02.00]And I was thinking of 06, so I apologize again for that one.
[462:11.96]Snooze and Copter, thanks for the $1.00.
[462:14.87]I think I bought God Hand digitally and gave my PlayStation 3 away.
[462:16.75]I think that's what happened.
[462:17.99]I have to get it again.
[462:44.97]Excuse me, sorry.
[462:48.61]Mini Clips.
[462:50.55]Thank you, Mini Clips, for the $14.35.
[462:54.61]No message.
[462:55.55]Nearly $15.
[462:56.47]Thank you so much.
[462:57.37]And on top of your other huge contributions.
[463:00.13]Thank you so much, Mini Clips.
[463:04.31]DragonZeroHexa, thanks for the $1 play.
[463:06.49]Some dirty Overwatch League.
[463:09.73]Overwatch League 2000.
[463:10.49]I'm not going to play Overwatch.
[463:16.13]No, I'm not gonna play Overwatch.
[463:18.29]I've moved on.
[463:25.49]I'm glad that people can play that game and enjoy it.
[463:27.35]I'm glad that people can play any game and enjoy it.
[463:29.76]But I got my time in Overwatch.
[463:31.22]I had my fun in Overwatch.
[463:34.00]I just... I've moved on.
[463:35.74]It's not something I'm probably ever gonna play again.
[463:38.04]Unless they make me as a character.
[463:40.66]If the next Overwatch character is Jerma, and it's me, and I have a hook,
[463:47.08]That I can kind of stick it into walls and like throw myself and it's a movement ability.
[463:53.54]And in my right hand is a three burst shotgun that goes boom, boom, boom.
[463:59.97]Boom, boom, boom.
[464:04.09]And you have to be pretty close range.
[464:06.65]And then my ultimate would be I turn into a top.
[464:10.37]And other people can... You can... Two other people on the team have to throw me.
[464:15.39]So it's a three-person ultimate, kind of.
[464:16.93]I can't use it unless there's two people around me.
[464:27.60]Boom, boom, top.
[464:28.44]There's a Beyblade, yeah.
[464:33.08]And I would have to cost 50 fucking dollars.
[464:37.41]And every cent...
[464:41.31]Goes directly to charity.
[464:42.30]It's the only way I would do it.
[464:53.00]But thank you to Dork Cube for the $1.
[464:55.99]This just in.
[464:56.55]Local streamer expects real gambling games in children's Sonic game.
[465:01.09]They had a slot machine in there.
[465:03.33]Inside that pinball machine there was a slot.
[465:07.92]It existed.
[465:10.71]Thank you, Broluck, for the $5.
[465:12.03]Dude, you, my fucking brain, please stop the Fever Dream Sonic game.
[465:21.32]It wasn't that bad.
[465:21.90]It was okay.
[465:23.38]There's some pretty good music in that game.
[465:31.10]Thank you, Aerolus, for the $1.
[465:32.02]jermaEarth.
[465:35.24]I'm going to be rocking that shirt when it comes in for sure.
[465:39.86]Thank you to no, no134 for the multiple bits here.
[465:46.70]And they say, go back to fucking Sonic.
[465:48.49]Fucking go back to Sonic.
[465:53.77]I can't.
[465:55.63]Crazy Taxi Space Channel 5.
[465:57.73]Those are my top picks.
[466:00.93]And so much so that we're going to go back and try to finish Space Channel 5 tomorrow.
[466:06.51]But thank you.
[466:08.06]Sonic was not a bad game.
[466:08.94]So many games, so little time.
[466:10.42]There are a lot.
[466:10.78]There are too many, some would argue.
[466:12.72]Which is why, how do you have the time to watch fucking 17 hours of cutscenes in Kingdom Hearts 3?
[466:39.96]That's a whole... The amount of cutscenes in Kingdom Hearts 3 is the amount of time it takes to play through on an average playthrough of Resident Evil 2 campaign.
[466:52.09]Who's got the time for that anymore?
[466:57.44]I know I just slurred those words.
[467:00.58]Gamer fatigue.
[467:06.67]Thank you Jack the Mac for the five dollars.
[467:09.69]Better watch that coming at you.
[467:13.25]Giggle, giggle, giggle.
[467:15.57]Wizard Rivet, thanks for the $1.
[467:17.62]It's time for slime, thanks for the $2.
[467:18.94]Yeah, Jet Set Radio is so good.
[467:20.94]Looking and sounds great and is really cool, but is really not that fun to play.
[467:28.54]But I forgot, though.
[467:32.10]My memory is not serving me correctly here.
[467:34.33]I remember having a ton of fun in Jet Grind Radio.
[467:40.66]Was I just young and just didn't care?
[467:52.21]It was just simpler.
[467:53.15]It just has a huge learning curve.
[467:57.02]You just have to get used to it again.
[467:58.36]Yeah, that's why I can't tell you that it was a bad game.
[468:02.58]I can't.
[468:04.02]I made the wood comment, but that was just me being a dick.
[468:09.20]I hold true to the statement that I think that is a good game.
[468:12.35]Just requires a lot of attention.
[468:16.01]But thank you.
[468:16.49]Thank you, Anonymous, for the $1.
[468:17.81]Hey, Jerma, it's the Animal Shelter guy.
[468:20.07]By the time you read this, it will be my birthday.
[468:21.75]I want to say thanks for having such a great community.
[468:24.63]I've gotten a lot of kind words from Chad on the Duck stream.
[468:27.51]Hey, love you, Chad.
[468:28.89]Oh, and for the peeing so often, just be happy.
[468:30.67]It's all you have.
[468:31.89]Most people over 70 have had hip replacements, so cheer up.
[468:39.06]you know that's true sometimes I forget uh thank you eclectic eclectic for the two dollars hey Jerma I wanted to say thanks for all that you do your vods and streams helped me this last year relax and pass the time on a long deployment I'm glad to be back and hopefully I'll be able to catch more of your streams thanks so much for what you do uh thank you as well uh welcome back
[469:08.12]Hopefully we see you around.
[469:18.76]Welcome back.
[469:22.03]Almost done here with the bits we have.
[469:24.57]We had a lot from... A lot from... Not bits, but we had a lot of subs from Great Canadian.
[469:31.69]Ten.
[469:33.39]Thank you.
[469:34.79]Came in a couple hours ago.
[469:38.15]Thank you, Plasma Player, for the $1.
[469:39.92]Just wanted to give a shout-out to... Hideki Naganuma, the composer for Jet Set Radio, for making awesome music for more than 25 years.
[469:50.92]He also composed music for Jet Set Radio Future and Sonic Rush.
[469:55.41]Uh... Lethal League Blaze ain't nothing like a funky beat.
[470:00.21]It's an absolute banger that feels like a Jet Set Radio song.
[470:03.95]Hold on a minute.
[470:09.76]They did the music for Lethal League?
[470:22.42]Just one song?
[470:24.10]Just the one track.
[470:25.14]That's really cool, though.
[470:28.38]That's very, very cool.
[470:33.07]Still going.
[470:33.63]25 years later.
[470:36.49]That's really awesome thank you for the one dollar plasma.
[470:37.49]Hey, Garfield the Monday killer thanks for the one dollar. Long time no see Jerma, unfortunately Garfield has had his bits stolen by Swiper the fox.
[470:46.49]So it took a while to track him down and take the garf bucks back. The punishment has been doled out properly. He got the Monday treatment.
[470:53.49]Anyway that's a pretty wacky video game you're playing over there.
[470:56.49]Jerma! I remember that one time I dated a news reporter for a while (that's not a joke by the way I dated one) she was nice but she had to move to space.
[471:05.23]That was a very long space, but I... The legend returns.
[471:09.29]Garfield.
[471:10.11]Thank you for the $1, Garfield.
[471:12.34]Superman, thanks for the $1.
[471:13.52]Hey, Jerma, I was just wondering if you played any PS2 eye toy games, because I had fun memories playing with them and my stepbrother.
[471:22.44]He's currently stationed in Sicily with the Navy as a dental technician, and I miss spending time with him.
[471:28.21]Also, how many siblings do you have, and what kind of jobs, if you don't mind me asking?
[471:33.85]I have a brother and a sister.
[471:39.92]And for the joke response, I have two brothers.
[471:47.66]And they're very, very mean, and I don't like them.
[471:50.74]That's the joke response.
[471:51.96]But for the real response... I mean, I don't know if I want to say.
[471:57.59]I don't know if my... I keep my siblings and my family kind of out of everything to do with what I'm doing.
[472:04.51]So, I don't really talk about my family too much.
[472:10.80]What was the fake dinner?
[472:11.88]Oh, he hates his family.
[472:16.64]No.
[472:16.80]A lot of you guys already know this, but I keep a lot of stuff in my private life just private.
[472:27.66]And that's just kind of how it's gonna stay.
[472:33.02]But I do appreciate the... I appreciate the inquiry.
[472:37.64]Inquiry, right?
[472:40.87]But yeah, they're both older.
[472:42.95]Older brother, older sister.
[472:48.55]Thank you so much, Superman.
[472:52.55]Dr. Steen, thanks for the $5.
[472:54.06]Read scary stories to tell in the dark on stream in the future.
[473:00.40]That means Bugleberry.
[473:01.14]I'm not going to do anything scary unless Bugleberry's on the screen.
[473:10.80]Tell me your credit card info.
[473:12.00]Okay.
[473:12.90]The credit card number is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[473:15.28]Expiration June of 2180.
[473:16.15]I got a good deal on that one.
[473:41.80]Hey, Tingy, thanks for the Vondala.
[473:42.96]I found the real reason why you didn't die on the 23rd.
[473:45.85]It's because your real death was determined during this stream.
[473:50.69]What?
[473:51.27]Your life is gone.
[473:52.23]That's what I'm turning.
[473:53.47]No, that would imply that I'm going to live to be 100.
[473:54.93]I'm not going to live to be 100.
[473:55.93]I'm not going online and typing in that, like, what date are you going to die?
[474:01.66]I'm not doing that.
[474:03.12]I did that once, and I'll never do it again.
[474:05.72]Back when I was in high school or something.
[474:09.94]I'm not doing it.
[474:12.21]I wouldn't, yeah, I wouldn't do it right now anyways.
[474:14.05]Fine, I'll do it.
[474:15.05]Why did I do that?
[474:15.66]Less than 25, non-smoker.
[474:17.02]Okay, when am I gonna, what's my death clock here?
[474:19.42]Why would you do that?
[474:22.18]Uh... Friday, July 4th, 2059.
[474:24.10]Okay.
[474:24.56]What's today's date right now?
[474:28.04]What year is it right now?
[474:28.78]2019?
[474:28.80]19, 29, 39, 40, 59.
[474:28.94]40 years from now, I'll be... I'll be like 80.
[474:45.34]Yeah, hey, July 4th, 2059, I'll be streaming.
[474:49.06]And I'm gonna get in... child's hockey pads.
[474:53.76]And a boxing helmet.
[474:56.06]We'll do it again.
[475:02.95]And then you guys can sync it up.
[475:04.83]You know, 40 years later.
[475:05.91]40 plus 30 equals 80.
[475:10.96]Well, I'm 33 right now.
[475:14.50]And that means I have like 40... How many more years from like 40?
[475:18.30]That would be 73.
[475:18.92]That's alright.
[475:19.32]73 equals 80.
[475:26.38]I'm gonna be fine.
[475:35.01]Thank you, Tingy, though.
[475:35.95]Thank you, Tingy, again, for $1 marketing your calendars, chat.
[475:38.21]Jerma's death is February- uh, Friday, July 4th, 2059.
[475:43.75]How many- you got- half- half of you guys wouldn't even probably be here anymore.
[475:48.79]How many of you guys can reliably say that you could put up with my shit for, like, another 40 years?
[475:55.74]What?
[475:57.22]Is that for- you could?
[476:01.76]Can you imagine if I was streaming still 40 years later?
[476:10.72]Imagine if you had a subscription to this channel and I'm like, oh, thanks for the subs.
[476:14.01]Oh, you guys, thanks for the 37-year sub.
[476:18.63]Well, that's kind of wild.
[476:24.95]I'll have a bunch of tiers.
[476:25.91]You know, there's like one month, three months, six months, 12 months, 24 months.
[476:30.40]Imagine having like a 25-year sub badge.
[476:35.94]What the hell would that even be?
[476:44.90]Imagine, like, other streamers.
[476:46.27]Think about that.
[476:48.27]Imagine if, like, Twitch is still going strong 20, 30 years from now.
[476:52.93]And some of your favorite streamers are still going.
[476:55.81]Hey, thank you, IcePick21252 for the 18 years in a row.
[477:02.18]Much love to you.
[477:02.66]Thanks for sticking around.
[477:05.24]We have another one coming in from Spaceman44.
[477:08.18]28 years.
[477:08.56]What a weird world this is going to be.
[477:22.92]The sub-baby goes to college.
[477:26.62]The usernames are gonna get really long.
[477:30.96]Yeah.
[477:39.30]Florida's gonna be the streaming capital of the world.
[477:46.27]Retirement homes are just gonna be lands.
[477:51.27]Welcome, everybody, to the 2081 League of Legends World Championship.
[477:58.82]Today we have... No, what this is implying that no one else is ever going to play video games ever again.
[478:07.16]Why is that the implication here?
[478:10.64]People are still going to be born and be playing games when they're younger.
[478:13.63]They just won't?
[478:21.78]Or will the old people be on Twitch still, and the new, younger... What is it, Generation Z?
[478:29.61]Generation, like, I don't know, XX4.
[478:33.48]Whenever they come out.
[478:36.00]They're gonna be in, like, holograms.
[478:37.76]So that will happen.
[478:38.52]It'll be... Twitch will just be where all the old people are.
[478:42.01]It'll be like reading a newspaper.
[478:45.76]Today we have, in this corner we have TSM.
[478:50.51]And like all the TSM guys will still be there.
[478:53.43]Versus Cloud9.
[478:58.19]Coming from Sunnydale Retirement Home.
[479:10.42]TSM.
[479:10.80]TSM.
[479:11.56]TSM.
[479:15.11]There's like fights in the fucking crowd.
[479:16.99]And the crowd is like 11 people.
[479:21.99]Four of them have like TSM hats on and fucking shirts.
[479:27.13]They're like throwing drinks at each other.
[479:28.75]You shut the fuck up.
[479:31.16]He went top.
[479:31.98]He was supposed to go middle.
[479:33.34]And that's the only reason why he lost.
[479:37.54]The nurse will come over.
[479:40.80]Dave, David.
[479:41.84]What is it?
[479:43.64]Is your diaper full?
[479:45.26]Yes, but I'm not moving till this match is over.
[479:48.56]Okay, that's okay.
[479:49.58]That's right.
[479:50.96]And I want some water, too.
[479:51.94]I don't think the kids will be laughing at us.
[480:05.39]All 11 people are just over 80.
[480:08.19]All 11 people.
[480:11.43]You'll have to go to, like, the archive.
[480:12.85]Archive.org, whatever, to go to Twitch.
[480:15.87]There'll be a new thing.
[480:19.31]Though, guys, there's gonna... You know what I'm saying?
[480:21.46]Like, in, like, 25, 30 years, Twitch is not gonna exist.
[480:24.24]It's gonna be something else.
[480:27.58]It'll be, like, going on virtual... It'll be, like, going on virtual roller coasters with celebrities.
[480:34.19]won't be any theme parks anymore you'll just put on like this weird suit and you'll like you you'll just be able to go to like Disney world online and like George clooney will just be there signing autographs on the ride and like that you're gonna be able to walk around it's gonna be like ready player one we'll have VR streams yeah but no that would be impossible because how would that ever work
[481:02.46]I've thought about that before too.
[481:03.42]It's like, hey, let's do this thing.
[481:04.76]We're gonna have, everyone's gonna have VR headsets on.
[481:07.20]We're all gonna be in the same place.
[481:09.06]Hey guys, meet me on the Vegas Strip.
[481:11.75]We're gonna go, it's gonna be so much fun.
[481:13.95]There's gonna be like 5,000 ghosts, just like people.
[481:19.87]That wouldn't work.
[481:21.45]What if you had like 10 streamers all streaming like in Hollywood at the same time and you just got like fucking 40,000 just people, like holograms walking around?
[481:35.88]It's going to be like weird ghost hangout chat.
[481:39.85]Imagine trying to go get a coffee.
[481:42.51]Going in with your hologram IRL stream.
[481:48.43]Can I get a large latte?
[481:52.04]What about anybody else?
[481:54.48]Oh no, there's these 6,000 people in your 900 square foot business.
[481:59.71]And they're all screaming.
[482:07.26]It's gonna be like private instances like WoW dungeons.
[482:13.27]Remember the infrastructure that needs to be there?
[482:15.79]Elon Musk wants to build underground tunnels.
[482:18.66]Where you drive your car into them and they like go really fast in a tube.
[482:25.62]That seems... That seems very reasonable compared to like a hologram VRChat in a coffee shop.
[482:48.86]There are already programs to allow VR viewers into your VR games.
[482:51.87]They just show up as little ghost headsets.
[482:53.77]They'd be looking like the Pied Piper walking down like... Walking down the street with like 4,000 little rats behind you headsets.
[483:04.48]Might as well get like a flute out and start dancing.
[483:20.79]you could be the giant rat that's true but anyways we're almost done just figured we'd talk about um virtual world the virtual reality and where it's going these are serious topics to talk about on the podcast what is gonna happen with ai
[483:54.05]That's going to be weird.
[483:56.63]A lot of people just kind of, you kind of, look, your parents, my parents, if there is the same type of exponential growth in technology, my parents saw the invention of the television, the color TV, and they're still alive.
[484:18.95]And we, I'm on Twitch right now.
[484:23.52]You can open up your telephone that is in your hand, press two buttons, and somebody will deliver a pizza to your house.
[484:32.65]They've seen that.
[484:34.11]They saw the Atari.
[484:36.45]What is going to be our Atari?
[484:40.27]If technology hasn't plateaued, which it may have, I don't know, that's weird to think about.
[484:44.62]You just don't even know.
[484:46.50]And it's become so normal.
[484:53.69]The Dreamcast was our Atari.
[484:55.15]Yeah, but when you're like 70, what are you going to be saying about Fortnite?
[485:05.47]I'm of the opinion that we're going to go too far.
[485:09.99]Like, think of just Wi-Fi.
[485:13.05]There are like wireless... There are wireless signals.
[485:18.45]You can go on the internet without a cord.
[485:23.28]We shouldn't be able to do that.
[485:25.04]That should not be possible, right?
[485:30.36]No cords?
[485:32.28]Wireless shit?
[485:35.35]That has to be, like, mutating our DNA.
[485:43.59]Like, 500 years from now, they're gonna go back.
[485:47.48]It's going to be like, oh, yeah, they were doing wireless.
[485:51.36]Yeah, they didn't have, but they weren't in, like, the shells.
[485:54.76]Yeah, see, nowadays, you know, you've got to be, if you go outside in your house, you've got to be wearing your, like, astronaut shell.
[486:06.87]How do you send something through a tube without a tube?
[486:08.75]Yeah, I don't get it.
[486:14.49]So right now, I'm holding my phone in my hand.
[486:18.89]I'm going to type something into it.
[486:21.64]And an electric zapper shock, electric data ray that we can't even see, just went through the back of my head, through my eyeballs.
[486:31.72]And mutated my DNA.
[486:35.89]400 years from now, we're going to have fins.
[486:38.01]We're going to have like fucking flippers on our asses.
[486:46.18]It's non-ionizing.
[486:48.52]Yeah, and they bled George Washington because they thought he had fucking puke in his blood.
[487:04.24]That's not how electromagnetic waves work.
[487:14.07]Jerma's ass flippers have not grown in yet.
[487:18.11]Oh, what the heck man?
[487:23.73]When am I gonna get my fins?
[487:39.00]If only smarter people than you were in charge.
[487:42.52]I know.
[487:44.18]If only there were people that were way more capable of breaking any of this down than me.
[487:49.20]They just don't exist, though.
[487:54.36]That's the problem.
[487:55.18]That's the worst thing to have to think about.
[487:57.20]Alright, alright.
[488:04.57]I'm done fucking around.
[488:06.59]There's too much puke in their blood.
[488:15.22]Hey, thank you, CluelessSniper for the $1.
[488:18.56]Deeps1 for the $1.
[488:20.02]MrLocalStreamer, who has streamed for three plus years, where are the three-year sub badges?
[488:25.69]I gotta make them.
[488:27.85]That's a long time.
[488:28.65]Three years in a row.
[488:30.05]That's a long time.
[488:37.11]Bless you.
[488:40.56]uh thank you to door cube for the one dollar I like how you read someone's message that said you weren't turning into an irritated old man and then immediately shout on kingdom hearts and questioned whether anybody actually liked the game but that was just a joke look I told you like 90 of everything I say is just like a poker it's just like a fire poker and there's like a joke target that it's it's not I'm just kidding it's not real
[489:09.54]Thank you, Venus Gothic, for the $10.
[489:11.34]No message.
[489:14.76]Thank you.
[489:15.86]Dr. Steen, thanks for $5.
[489:16.68]Hey, Jeremy, I've got a question for you.
[489:18.10]Why Vegas?
[489:19.76]Just curious as to why you chose to move there instead of anywhere else in the entire world, such as Antarctica.
[489:24.74]Well, Antarctica is too cold.
[489:27.69]You can't live there unless you're on some type of research base or one of those kind of areas in Antarctica that are habitable.
[489:36.11]Some people do, I think, live there.
[489:39.79]Uh, but I've touched upon it a few times.
[489:42.85]Vegas is cheaper than LA.
[489:45.11]I wanted to live in LA.
[489:47.29]It's close to LA.
[489:48.99]It's its own entertainment hub.
[489:50.61]It's got its own studios.
[489:51.83]It's got its own movie, TV shows, TV studio stuff.
[489:55.43]It's a 24 hour city.
[489:57.01]So, I mean, it's 1130 right now and I'm about to go get like food.
[490:01.17]It's late, late.
[490:02.75]It's a late person's town.
[490:06.14]I love kind of the lights.
[490:08.66]I love the town.
[490:09.70]I love the city in general.
[490:10.85]Been here quite a few times in the past.
[490:15.19]And Circus Circus Casino is here.
[490:20.17]It's one of the lowest reviewed casinos on the Strip, and it's my favorite one.
[490:26.51]actually had a conversation with one of my close friends when we went to Vegas together and we talked about we went to circus circus we were like oh this is amazing I love it here this is so cool and then we read all the reviews online how it was like everyone you know this is a bit different thought it was a piece of and we had this long kind of internal conversation with and with each other about like are we the weirdos are we like the people
[490:53.57]that these reviews are talking about.
[490:56.11]And it was a really, really, like, existential kind of conversation.
[491:04.78]Like, we loved this place.
[491:06.14]Oh, this is great!
[491:08.14]And you go read the reviews, like, I cannot believe how bad this place was.
[491:12.41]It's like, why did we like this place?
[491:20.39]But no, those are all the reasons.
[491:22.65]It's a 24-hour city.
[491:24.67]There's a lot to do.
[491:25.41]There's a lot of entertainment stuff here.
[491:26.73]It's way cheaper than LA by a long shot.
[491:33.40]It's great.
[491:34.80]I've been absolutely adoring it so far.
[491:44.36]You shouldn't base your enjoyment on other people's opinions.
[491:46.79]Oh, no, no, absolutely not.
[491:49.26]But I guess, I mean, this is coming from a guy that liked the Venom movie.
[491:53.75]Right?
[491:53.91]Does that make me a bad guy?
[491:55.01]Am I a bad guy?
[491:57.73]I might be.
[491:58.19]No, yes.
[492:13.38]Everyone liked the Venom movie.
[492:15.16]No, they didn't.
[492:17.91]You know what I mean?
[492:18.33]Like, Twitters were, like, unbelievable.
[492:20.51]Un-fucking-believable.
[492:25.55]I can't imagine anybody enjoying the Venom movie.
[492:28.16]You have to imagine that they would also be gambling at Circus Circus.
[492:31.34]One of these reviews, it said that.
[492:34.64]I was like, what the fuck?
[492:46.40]I felt personally attacked by it.
[492:50.64]But thank you to Dr. Steen.
[492:59.11]Vegas is a great place.
[493:00.13]Vegas is one of those places everybody loves to visit, but people just kind of forget that it exists and they don't want to live there.
[493:06.95]And the unfortunate truth around it, I guess, is that if you don't want to be, you know, for employment opportunities, there's the casinos, there's a lot of restaurants, there's a lot of entertainment stuff here.
[493:19.23]And hospitality stuff.
[493:20.89]Hotels, restaurants, casinos.
[493:23.71]But other than that, that's not, at the moment, you know, it's a growing city.
[493:33.72]But I love it.
[493:35.62]I think it was the right call.
[493:39.16]And those are the end of the bits.
[493:42.01]Can you imagine enjoying things?
[493:45.03]I can't imagine it.
[493:50.59]See, like, remember what I just told you?
[493:53.32]Kingdom Hearts is a great series.
[493:55.30]I hope you love it, and I hope you enjoy it.
[493:57.60]Hope you get a lot out of it.
[493:59.16]I really mean that.
[494:03.69]But make another fucking Chrono Trigger.
[494:08.24]You should be ashamed of yourselves for not doing that.
[494:14.20]I'm sorry.
[494:15.18]I'm sorry.
[494:16.06]That's it.
[494:17.50]We're going to roll the credits.
[494:25.64]I got like the weird bug tonight for some reason.
[494:29.79]They made Chrono Cross.
[494:30.59]Yes, they did.
[494:30.95]And then they were going to make a third one and they gave up on it.
[494:34.41]But thank you all the subs, all the free subs.
[494:35.83]You guys are amazing.
[494:39.00]Sorry, I'll get to work.
[494:47.08]Thank you Venus Gothic for the five dollars.
[494:48.68]Jerma, everything you say on stream is the equivalent of watching someone swing a bat at a hornet's nest.
[494:54.41]No, I don't think that's true.
[494:59.65]That's not true.
[495:05.31]What did I say this stream that was hitting the hornet's nest?
[495:17.12]I'm just messing around.
[495:19.58]I really am just fucking around.
[495:20.90]Hope you guys know that.
[495:27.57]Sonic Adventure.
[495:28.57]I didn't say that.
[495:30.31]Liking Circus Circus.
[495:31.27]That's true.
[495:31.79]It's just a prank.
[495:46.31]Yeah, I mean, look, I'm of the opinion that there is true criticism
[496:08.41]There's true, you know, if you think that there's something, I mean, at the end of the day, stuff costs money, and if you don't think it was worth paying for, then of course.
[496:16.89]Criticism is important, very important.
[496:20.42]But also I'm one of those people that I like to kind of just poke fun at even some of my own shit that I think is, you know, that I like or that I don't like.
[496:28.60]I think you have to kind of, the mood doesn't have to go as negative
[496:36.78]as I think a lot of critiques can be.
[496:41.50]As long as people know that, for the most part, you're just trying to have a good time, then all is great.
[496:58.67]But I agree.
[496:59.87]There's plenty of things that I think are great that people think are bad or dumb or... And that's fine.
[497:05.63]That's what makes us different.
[497:07.83]You know?
[497:12.33]Everybody doesn't have to like the same things.
[497:25.54]Fuck, I could go for some gravy.
[497:33.90]The world would be a weird place without personal interests and opinions.
[497:39.56]I agree.
[497:39.98]It would be, uh... Look, if everyone didn't have different opinions and different tastes and different points of views and thinking, we would all end up just like Squidward in that episode where he gets the can of bread with all the other Squidwards walking in line and going to the Squidward grocery store.
[498:05.68]And it seems great for a little while.
[498:09.77]But watch that episode.
[498:18.82]Tell me how it goes at the end.
[498:26.14]Canned bread.
[498:31.58]Wasn't the point of that episode that he was the odd Squidward and wasn't like them.
[498:36.36]And that as much as he doesn't like SpongeBob and SpongeBob causes so many problems, it's still, it's an interesting person.
[498:43.26]Interesting thing.
[498:52.66]Canned burgers exist.
[498:53.82]That's really strange.
[498:58.58]But we had one final bit come in from Dr. Steen, $15.
[499:08.81]Thanks for answering the question.
[499:09.71]I'm going to go to school in New York City, and I love the fact that I can do stuff at night as well.
[499:15.13]Have a great night.
[499:16.73]Jerma, enjoy your food.
[499:18.12]Spend $100 on it.
[499:20.38]You deserve a feast after all the work you do for us.
[499:22.64]Keep on doing what you do, and we will be there the whole time, riding every ride you throw us onto.
[499:29.20]Go, get your VR headsets ready.
[499:31.50]And close them.
[499:33.22]Because we're going on that roller coaster.
[499:35.30]Let's go.
[499:36.54]$100 meal.
[499:38.31]I'm not sure I'm going to do that right now, but...
[499:41.52]Thank you so much, Dr. Steen.
[499:43.34]And finally, Ike Turtle with $1.
[499:44.84]I missed the Tony Hawk stream a few days ago, but watched the VOD and it was good.
[499:48.60]Have you considered trying out Tony Hawk Underground or Thug Pro?
[499:54.28]Oh, that's not Underground.
[499:55.46]It's a mod.
[499:55.86]Oh, it is.
[499:56.56]It's a mod for Tony Hawk's Underground 2.
[499:58.20]It allows you to play pretty much any Tony Hawk level that's ever been made.
[500:05.04]Yeah, that's an interesting idea.
[500:08.66]Because Tony Hawk 2 is great.
[500:10.00]Tony Hawk 3 is great.
[500:12.24]I'm going to have to type that into Google.
[500:18.67]How often has Jerma gambled?
[500:19.83]Is that what he does in between streams?
[500:23.29]In between... This is what I do.
[500:27.27]I just turn... Alright, see you guys later.
[500:28.81]I'll see you tomorrow.
[500:29.81]And the stream turns off and I get my coat on and I go to the casino.
[500:34.21]I don't think I... I would run out of money really, really quick if that happened.
[500:40.22]No, like all things, as long as you control yourself, moderate yourself, all things in moderation, and you don't do anything insane, then, you know, if you go to the casino once in a while, you can have some fun without being crazy and have a couple of drinks.
[501:05.48]But no, I do not go to the casino every day.
[501:14.41]If you go to the casino trying to win money, that's not what you're doing.
[501:17.73]That's not correct.
[501:20.25]If you go to the casino, you should be going to the casino to have fun to play.
[501:26.30]You can go play without doing $500 blackjack hands.
[501:30.26]You can play and have fun.
[501:32.42]You don't have to do that.
[501:37.82]But having said that, I am about $60,000 to $70,000 down.
[501:40.97]So...
[501:44.69]And I go, uh, I go like five days a week.
[501:52.12]I'm just kidding.
[501:52.68]I'm not.
[501:53.06]I'm kidding.
[501:53.56]That's a joke.
[501:57.86]So should I start doing $5,000 blackjack hands?
[502:00.69]If you have $50 million in your checking account, then it don't, whatever.
[502:09.65]I can't tell you what to do.
[502:16.06]streamer is encouraging chat to gamble no that's not what I said don't first of all don't do it unless you're old enough and only gamble if you know that you're you can control potential urges that you'll have in the casino all casinos are designed in a way to keep you there they don't have any windows they're all a mess of a layout to make sure you get lost
[502:43.92]Don't go in there alone.
[502:44.96]Go in there with a few friends.
[502:48.83]Because then you get to keep each other honest.
[502:50.95]So you can't just sit there and be like, ah, this is a new slot machine that I want to play.
[502:56.23]Just keep going.
[502:57.42]Keep going.
[502:58.22]Keep going.
[502:58.84]No, keep going.
[503:01.02]Somebody can be like, hey man, what are you doing?
[503:03.80]Ah, nothing.
[503:12.26]In nine years of Vegas, I literally never played a single table game.
[503:15.08]I went to movies, buffets, arcades, tons of stuff that had nothing to do with gambling.
[503:19.04]That's another thing about Las Vegas.
[503:21.00]It's not just gambling.
[503:23.32]There's so much stuff here.
[503:24.46]There's so many shows.
[503:26.05]There's some insane movie theaters.
[503:39.17]But yeah, life lessons.
[503:45.71]I would say that about anything.
[503:50.81]You know, just because your car can drive technically over 120 miles per hour on the highway, you're not going to do it.
[503:59.63]You're going to go 60, 65, whatever.
[504:02.89]You're going to go like 60 to 70, right?
[504:05.77]Just because you can doesn't mean you will or should.
[504:21.19]Speed limit's 80 in Nevada?
[504:23.13]No, it's not.
[504:23.81]Nevada.
[504:29.59]Alright.
[504:29.89]Good night, everybody.
[504:32.56]Last one.
[504:33.08]John Horns for $1.
[504:33.80]Just want to let you know how much you mean to us.
[504:35.54]We genuinely give a fuck about you and hope you have continued success in the future.
[504:39.02]You earned it.
[504:42.30]It's incredible to hear that, that there's that many people that are kind of rooting for me.
[504:48.09]Uh,
[504:52.23]It floors me every time.
[504:53.49]And that kind of support pushes me to want to achieve the things that I want to achieve.
[505:01.17]So thank you so much, everybody.
[505:04.01]Cheers to that.
[505:04.79]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[505:05.77]Same time around 3 o'clock Pacific.
[505:08.15]We will finish Space Channel 5 Part 2.
[505:12.03]And maybe just a little bit of Crazy Taxi for old time's sake.
[505:16.49]Don't you know what I mean?
[505:18.05]Have a great night, guys.
[505:18.61]See you tomorrow.
[505:22.00]Take care.
