[00:00.73]Hello.
[00:03.78]Good afternoon, everybody.
[00:09.08]EU stream.
[00:09.98]Well, I'm a few hours early.
[00:12.52]1.30, 2.30, 3.30, 4.00.
[00:14.04]Yeah, like two and a half hours early.
[00:16.12]There's a reason for it, though.
[00:21.60]I wanted to make sure I could get at least a solid three hours, four hours in today.
[00:27.40]I got a lot of shit to do.
[00:29.66]I'm just running around in circles!
[00:32.60]And I mean that quite literally.
[00:34.94]When the stream ends, I still have a bunch of pent-up energy and I fucking just sprint in a circle for like 15 minutes.
[00:41.81]And then I go to bed.
[00:45.79]You know how hard it is to sprint in a circle?
[00:48.71]Have any of you guys ever tried that?
[00:51.58]Like a 5-10 foot circle.
[00:53.78]Can anybody sprint in a circle?
[00:56.56]You can't.
[00:57.20]It's too hard.
[01:01.48]Like a like a 10-foot circle you know now you can't Did you drink your shower water again?
[01:09.55]No, I put it in my mouth and I spit it out like every normal human on earth But today Like I said starting early cuz I want to make sure I can stream for a few hours We're gonna play something that's gonna take probably a few hours and that is Some of you guys are gonna be really happy about this.
[01:29.13]Those of you that weren't here over the last few days
[01:32.60]I'm going to say this game, and you're going to go, what the what?
[01:38.34]Ikaruga.
[01:40.86]Your speakers just went, and blew you away.
[01:43.90]Your mouth is flapping back.
[01:45.74]You can't fucking believe it.
[01:48.94]When I just said that word.
[01:52.24]Ikaruga is a shoot-em-up.
[01:54.54]It is a bullet hell game, and it's considered to be one of the best ever made.
[02:01.97]Now that's not according to me.
[02:02.95]That's according to every single person I've ever known in my whole life.
[02:12.60]Doesn't matter.
[02:14.28]Now this is a pog, yeah?
[02:16.38]Play the real one.
[02:17.50]Toho.
[02:22.64]Alright, I'm gonna have to be honest with you here.
[02:23.86]Alright.
[02:28.44]The... The more that people tell me to do something...
[02:33.34]You know the less inclined I am to actually do that thing, right?
[02:42.30]The more that people say, play this game, the more I go, eh, maybe I don't want to do that.
[02:50.23]Like, I've seen Play Toho, even, I'm talking like six months ago.
[02:55.49]Just, people just write it, and that's like the only thing they write.
[03:05.95]Don't play Touhou.
[03:07.35]I mean, maybe I will.
[03:08.37]I don't know.
[03:13.32]He hates us.
[03:14.40]Don't take your shirt off on stream.
[03:16.40]I don't think I'll be doing that one.
[03:20.70]I don't plan on that one.
[03:21.78]But anyways, let's go.
[03:22.54]I'm gonna play Ikaruga.
[03:25.13]It looks fucking awesome.
[03:26.91]It looks so good.
[03:33.42]I looked at it, and I was like, wow.
[03:36.48]This one's gonna be a good one.
[03:38.94]Let's take a look.
[03:39.46]What do you think?
[03:42.89]Already the menu's clean.
[03:46.19]Is this loud?
[03:48.67]You tell me this is loud, okay?
[03:52.59]Why do you say, oh no?
[03:53.81]Somebody said, oh no.
[03:54.74]Why?
[03:54.92]Oh no?
[03:56.20]Oh no?
[04:01.87]This doesn't have blood.
[04:03.75]No, but it's got explosions.
[04:06.12]All right, all right.
[04:06.96]As long as it got explosions, then you got it.
[04:08.86]That's fine.
[04:09.30]Count me in.
[04:09.76]You're going to be digging a hole in this one?
[04:13.00]No, no, I promise.
[04:14.06]Okay, thank God.
[04:16.27]The last, like, six streams have been you digging holes, bro.
[04:19.77]No, I promise there'll be explosions.
[04:21.23]Okay.
[04:23.11]Better be.
[04:28.14]All right.
[04:30.14]Select with the stick.
[04:31.26]Decide with the button.
[04:36.46]This is a little loud for me.
[04:37.66]All right.
[04:39.13]Arcade mode.
[04:39.73]The default arcade mode.
[04:40.81]Prototype mode.
[04:41.67]Has the limit of shots.
[04:44.07]Chapter select.
[04:44.79]Select the level to play.
[04:48.35]Let's just do arcade mode, right?
[04:51.88]We can try the other modes later.
[04:54.12]This has got to be turned down, by the way.
[04:57.73]All right, this is very difficult.
[04:58.57]This is easy, normal, and hard.
[05:01.73]Whoa!
[05:06.61]What just happened?
[05:13.41]Why did that just do that?
[05:14.99]What was that?
[05:16.09]I didn't even hear that.
[05:16.83]I just saw that.
[05:17.59]I saw the- I saw the audio go up to like a thousand.
[05:20.10]What happened?
[05:21.12]Oh, you're gonna get flown away!
[05:24.20]You're gonna get flown away when I say the words Ikaruga and your face is gonna be flapping!
[05:31.24]I'm sorry.
[05:31.82]I didn't mean- I don't know what happened.
[05:33.21]I didn't do anything.
[05:35.93]Okay.
[05:36.73]Please don't do that again.
[05:39.60]What the fuck are you doing?
[05:40.54]I didn't do anything!
[05:41.34]I just was like changing the audio level over here.
[05:43.53]I didn't do anything!
[05:45.23]Alright, enemies with the same polarity return fire.
[05:47.59]That sounds like fun.
[05:49.53]Alright, enemies all- I mean... Let me try normal first.
[05:54.08]What a fucking professional streamer.
[05:55.74]It- It did that on its own.
[05:57.76]I didn't do anything.
[05:58.32]I'm doing normal first.
[06:01.04]I will not die until I achieve something, even though the ideal- I didn't read that.
[06:06.39]Uh... Don't you know not to use fucking vertical video?
[06:11.45]How do I move?
[06:12.01]Uh... How do you move?
[06:16.14]Oh, it's W, A, S, D. Alright, W, A, S, D. I'm already dead.
[06:18.58]Alright, hold on.
[06:19.38]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[06:19.98]Alright, I'm dead again.
[06:25.46]Alright, chapter one.
[06:27.86]That last... I can't even read that.
[06:29.68]It's too fast.
[06:33.57]This is like... You have to switch polarity in this game.
[06:36.69]You can absorb bullets if you're the same polarity.
[06:40.93]You... I looked at the fucking instructions before we played.
[06:44.17]If you absorb bullets of the same polarity, listen to me, then you can do extra damage.
[06:50.58]For instance, see, there's white and black.
[06:52.32]Black and white, that's it.
[06:53.24]I'm dead again.
[06:54.54]And I lose.
[06:55.34]Alright.
[06:56.22]Cool.
[06:56.88]We'll, uh, we'll get... Alright, let's go.
[07:01.39]Now uploading the replay.
[07:02.93]Don't upload the fucking replay.
[07:07.10]I don't want someone to see that replay.
[07:08.92]What do you mean, upload the replay?
[07:13.22]No, I don't want to upload a fucking replay.
[07:15.20]All right, so that's how it works.
[07:18.92]It's games considered one of the hardest games ever made, too.
[07:21.56]I forgot to mention that.
[07:22.76]I didn't even know what the buttons were.
[07:23.96]All right, let me explain.
[07:27.22]Let's do some explanations here.
[07:29.01]Explanation number one.
[07:31.53]I don't want to watch the replay.
[07:35.38]Thank God there's no replay.
[07:37.41]Thank God.
[07:40.15]Wait.
[07:46.29]Uh...
[08:02.93]That's so bad.
[08:09.46]You get three lives, okay?
[08:11.18]You get three lives.
[08:12.32]And after you die three times, it's over.
[08:17.24]But his polarity is, you see, the game's fucking fantastic.
[08:23.09]You have to absorb bullets of the same polarity.
[08:26.90]As you see in this replay.
[08:28.12]Check that out.
[08:28.64]See?
[08:29.72]Black goes into black.
[08:31.80]And then, as you see... Wait, Otto, what's wrong?
[08:35.04]Otto, what are you doing?
[08:35.84]Alright, that one's done.
[08:42.25]He's not even actually playing.
[08:43.33]No, I was just watching a cool replay.
[08:45.11]Alright, let me try this again.
[08:48.87]We gotta get through... And you guys want me to play it hard?
[08:52.13]Have you lost your mind?
[08:57.08]You want me to play on heart.
[09:00.76]This is an actual fake... That was real gameplay that I previously... That was previously recorded gameplay.
[09:08.27]Let Otto play the game.
[09:09.37]Alright, let's try this again.
[09:10.85]So remember, polarity is important.
[09:13.65]Let's see if I can do... I didn't even know W... I thought it was move with the mouse.
[09:20.90]You do double damage to people of the opposite polarity.
[09:30.56]Oh, this is pretty sick, actually.
[09:31.70]Alright, and then I can do a super move.
[09:34.42]If I press mouse 4, I can shoot out homing missiles.
[09:37.08]Can you hear me?
[09:38.02]Can you guys hear me?
[09:44.18]Just don't run into anybody.
[09:50.24]Watch out!
[09:55.55]If you get three people in a row, you get a chain, by the way.
[09:59.91]Like that.
[10:00.27]I have two chain?
[10:07.71]Okay, cool.
[10:08.67]Wait.
[10:12.16]Oh, dear god.
[10:15.08]Ugh!
[10:18.34]Alright, kill the one on the right first.
[10:20.06]Double damage, right?
[10:24.30]Holy shit, that was actually really cool.
[10:25.88]Fuck!
[10:26.50]Sorry.
[10:33.95]I get three lives, I'm alright.
[10:40.37]After this, I'm gonna have to see what's going on with Otto.
[10:42.26]He wants to get out.
[10:43.46]Absorb that whole thing.
[10:48.24]Whoa, is that gonna hit me if I go from behind there?
[10:52.54]Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, I've changed... Oh my god, changed polarity again.
[10:56.47]I can absorb... Oh, fuck.
[10:57.89]Oh my god, what do I do?
[11:06.24]It's so confusing, but it's actually really cool.
[11:10.00]I have to hit the... I didn't kill them.
[11:19.04]Wait, am I the boss?
[11:21.44]But this is on normal difficulty.
[11:26.01]I have one health.
[11:28.15]Is he white?
[11:28.61]Yup.
[11:33.97]Oh, man.
[11:34.61]Fuck.
[11:35.49]God.
[11:36.17]All right, hold on.
[11:36.67]I think Otto needs to go outside.
[11:37.94]I'll be right back.
[12:33.42]Yeah, he's okay.
[12:38.62]He's starting to get nervous.
[12:41.12]Because of the boxes.
[12:42.14]Have you ever moved with a dog before?
[12:47.15]They start to see you pack up shit.
[12:49.49]And they... They don't like it.
[12:51.53]They're like, what are you doing?
[12:53.11]Like, why are you doing that?
[12:55.33]Oh, this is my house.
[12:57.24]Where are we going?
[12:59.58]We're trying to make it as easy as a process as possible.
[13:06.05]But he's okay.
[13:11.02]It's true.
[13:11.44]Alright, in the meantime, let's go back here.
[13:16.38]I'm gonna get into this fucking game.
[13:20.38]I'm not saving the replay.
[13:23.25]Why am I stealing from Otto?
[13:32.54]Forget the link, he's gonna play.
[13:33.86]Yeah, forget the link.
[13:35.10]I'll click on it in an hour.
[13:38.40]Here we go.
[13:41.42]Jeremy, you're gonna finish Odama today.
[13:43.37]Alright, start banning people that say the word Odama.
[13:47.59]For like four days.
[13:54.93]Shit!
[13:55.31]Restart.
[13:59.03]I switched polarity in the wrong time.
[14:11.29]What's the story of this game?
[14:15.91]You're gonna ban the entire chat.
[14:17.49]Yeah, I know.
[14:19.16]Alright, four chain.
[14:22.92]I got four chain.
[14:25.16]Alright, I get it, I get it.
[14:35.64]mods don't care what are you why are you doing that go back to four oh I see I gotta absorb okay I have max energy right now who the is calling me what the hell by a lot of stream time hold on
[15:35.87]I don't want to save fucking 10% on my fucking car insurance, okay?
[15:43.19]Jesus God.
[15:44.15]That's a good deal, though.
[15:54.58]Should I call them back?
[16:00.87]Should I ring them back?
[16:06.63]You gotta do polarity switching.
[16:09.35]Like this.
[16:09.81]Bang.
[16:11.33]Like that.
[16:11.85]Alright, get it again.
[16:15.02]Absorb.
[16:16.70]Oh my god, what did I do?
[16:17.52]I'm a fucking idiot.

[16:19.90]I'm okay.
[16:23.20]I got full energy.
[16:24.98]Why should I use this?
[16:26.20]It's all homing missiles, by the way.
[16:36.25]Alright, this part fucked me up last time.
[16:37.53]Get rid of the right one.
[16:40.24]Good.
[16:41.26]Absorb it all.

[17:07.47]I think I'll be okay.
[17:10.78]That was hard.
[17:14.32]Should I switch?
[17:15.32]I don't know.
[17:16.14]He has a black shield.
[17:18.96]Eat the whole thing.
[17:25.25]Oh, I get it.
[17:25.67]Okay, I can... Fuck.
[17:30.77]God damn it.
[17:33.44]I get it.
[17:37.03]Okay.
[17:38.77]Now what?
[17:40.79]What's she switching to?
[17:47.43]Sir, are you sure we're having a one-day deal?
[17:56.24]Why is today the day?
[17:57.52]Just in case you want to take us up on our offer.
[18:00.66]40% off the whole store.
[18:02.62]You know that, Mr. Jeremy Elbertson?
[18:10.49]I'm okay.
[18:11.79]Oh my god.
[18:12.95]Alright, I'm gonna throw- I'm gonna fucking throw my phone into the toilet in a second, I swear to god.
[18:22.55]Hey, they can't call you if your phone's in the toilet.
[18:26.12]You know, that's thinking face.
[18:30.48]God damn it, this is fucking hard.
[18:32.14]Alright, I'm turning my phone on silent.
[18:53.50]He thinks this is hard.
[18:54.66]I'll get there.
[18:55.94]Wait, we're 30 minutes into the stream and we're already on phone in toilet stage.
[19:05.28]Well, no, not because of the game.
[19:08.39]Because people keep fucking calling my phone.
[19:13.59]I didn't say I wanted to put my computer into the toilet.
[19:16.35]Because that would be sufficient if I was angry with the game.
[19:30.90]Alright, take that, take that, switch around.
[19:32.74]Alright, let's go.
[19:34.06]Double fucking damage.
[19:36.64]This is a phone game, though.
[19:39.19]This is not a... I mean, it is as big... Alright, whatever.
[19:45.41]This is a hyper pay attention video game.
[19:47.69]I'm gonna just lock in.
[19:49.13]Alright, I got max energy.
[20:00.82]I gotta save this.
[20:01.44]Let's do it.
[20:01.78]You know what?
[20:02.36]You can just keep doing it.
[20:05.62]Watch that polarity shift.
[20:19.12]I gotta become like an actual gamer here.
[20:21.24]You know what I mean?
[20:32.84]It takes a lot for your brain to understand and process that you should run into bullets.
[20:37.27]You know what I'm saying?
[20:41.33]My brain is like, don't run into those bullets.
[20:42.93]But I'm like, yes, you have to.
[20:49.86]There we go.
[20:50.96]Right side.
[20:53.74]Wow!
[21:00.08]Ah!
[21:00.82]Ah!
[21:02.24]Same thing happened last time!
[21:03.72]It's okay, just don't panic.
[21:13.12]Oh, fuck.
[21:19.08]Okay, here we go.
[21:20.22]I'm at the boss again.
[21:21.04]Just be careful.
[21:23.81]Kill the things on the left and right.
[21:27.37]He's got those two orbiters.
[21:31.72]Need that health?
[21:32.22]Get rid of it.
[21:33.40]Good.
[21:38.02]Come on, move, move, move, move, move.
[21:39.06]Don't get hit.
[21:42.02]Don't be a fucking... Don't.
[21:46.17]God, this game's like Binding of Isaacs.
[21:47.81]Okay, shut up.
[21:51.13]Do that one.
[21:52.27]Alright, now, what do we switch to?
[21:55.61]Ooh!
[21:56.68]Alright, now they switched.
[21:57.76]The polarity shifted.
[21:58.79]I get it.
[21:59.21]Alright, now they're different.
[22:00.25]They're different.
[22:01.15]Fuck!
[22:01.93]Okay, I need to be quiet.
[22:11.11]Stop being like a tuber in play.
[22:22.83]Oh shit!
[22:44.70]Got him, got him!
[23:02.34]Did I get him?
[23:13.79]That was actually really hard.
[23:15.11]That's whatever.
[23:15.77]Seize.
[23:19.67]What are we at?
[23:20.11]Level 2?
[23:20.79]Alright, let's do it.
[23:33.14]Oh, they fly into you and shit now.
[23:36.91]Oh, man.
[23:37.73]Damn it.
[23:38.25]Game over.
[23:38.73]All right.
[23:39.09]Do I get to start at level two?
[23:44.38]Yeah.
[23:50.30]Yes, I do.
[23:53.03]Yes, I do.
[23:53.89]Because he didn't think so.
[23:57.03]I want to watch him suffer.
[24:00.23]I'm only on level two, guys.
[24:03.15]Okay, arcade mode.
[24:04.92]Chapter two.
[24:07.68]Unnormal.
[24:11.07]This ain't Chapter 2.
[24:11.93]What the fuck?
[24:17.37]Why is this not... This is supposed to be Chapter 2.
[24:24.89]Arcade starts from the beginning.
[24:26.48]Oh, alright, alright.
[24:27.22]Well... Let's see if I can just do this.
[24:33.70]So what do I have to select?
[24:34.64]Just the other one?
[24:43.58]I just have to do chapter mode.
[24:47.64]Well, this is good practice.
[24:56.00]Good practice.
[24:56.81]I like practice.
[24:59.67]Oops.
[25:01.49]Alright, that was good practice.
[25:08.95]Alright, chapter select.
[25:14.35]Please select game.
[25:15.17]Wait.
[25:15.97]Chapter 1.
[25:16.53]No.
[25:17.59]Chapter 2.
[25:18.33]Here we go.
[25:20.99]This one's called Trial.
[25:23.85]Enemies with the same polarity return.
[25:25.49]Oh, yeah.
[25:25.69]That's fine.
[25:27.79]Here we go.
[25:28.05]Let's do it.
[25:31.19]Turn continues on.
[25:34.55]I could do that.
[25:35.21]Are people going to think I'm a cheater?
[25:45.27]Holy shit!
[25:48.20]This is fucking crazy.
[25:54.12]Take it all.
[25:54.56]Observe the whole thing.
[25:55.18]Alright, I gotta switch polarity here.
[26:01.00]I'm on the same one.
[26:03.88]Put a black.
[26:06.83]Why is he not playing Afterburner?
[26:13.96]I don't know.
[26:14.74]We're playing Ikaruga.
[26:16.80]This shit is so loud still.
[26:18.08]Hold on.
[26:24.19]You gotta be kidding me.
[26:24.91]Right when I switched.
[26:26.03]Fuck.
[26:27.13]That's annoying.
[26:32.23]God damn it.
[26:33.41]Fuck.
[26:33.75]That's crazy.
[26:34.59]Okay.
[26:34.81]You gotta do it immediately.
[26:36.03]I gotta turn the game down.
[26:48.31]Am I gonna play as Hulk at some point?
[26:52.83]Yes.
[27:07.14]How many chapters are there in the game?
[27:15.29]Oh my god, I tried to get so fancy.
[27:16.55]Fuck.
[27:16.87]Alright.
[27:17.47]Do it again.
[27:18.51]Call me Restart Randy.
[27:19.33]That's fine.
[27:19.63]I don't care.
[27:39.16]The bosses are the most interesting thing to me.
[27:42.40]Jesus, man.
[27:44.52]Ugh.
[27:48.15]It's so erratic and... I should have gotten hit like five times by now.
[28:03.38]Take him out, take him out, take him out.
[28:07.42]Alright, alright.
[28:07.90]What a bad place to lose a life.
[28:12.27]Use more magic?
[28:25.18]Alright, this is where it gets funky.
[28:26.38]Alright, here we go.
[28:33.12]Jesus!
[28:35.50]I have to go through them, I guess, huh?
[28:48.92]Oh, man!
[28:50.68]Oh, man!
[28:51.32]What do I do?
[28:51.84]I...
[28:54.57]Okay.
[28:55.88]Wait, is that a... Open.
[28:58.72]Open!
[29:00.00]Open, please!
[29:01.58]Open!
[29:03.46]Oh, man!
[29:05.38]I'm gonna get crushed!
[29:08.59]Holy shit!
[29:18.17]I, like, cheated.
[29:19.53]How did I cheat and win?
[29:32.52]Oh man!
[29:36.74]It's too much!
[29:37.65]It's too much for me to do!
[29:39.13]It's too much for me to do, I think!
[29:45.05]This is too much for my brain to do!
[29:49.97]Ugh!
[29:53.98]How do I lock it?
[30:06.82]Oh shit!
[30:11.02]Fuck.
[30:11.32]I'm gonna die.
[30:12.32]I'm gonna die here.
[30:13.90]This is where I die.
[30:15.72]This is how it ends for me.
[30:17.41]I'm gonna just explode.
[30:21.01]Okay, I have to be the boss too.
[30:32.51]I need to put continues on I gotta put on continues, dude I can't believe I made it through that.
[30:55.12]I don't have any I've no idea how that happened.
[30:57.84]Oh
[31:02.55]Okay, weak point.
[31:03.91]What?
[31:05.37]Get those wings?
[31:09.01]What do I have to do?
[31:09.95]Open up the fucking crevice?
[31:12.84]I think I have to bring both of his head down?
[31:14.40]Oh!
[31:24.14]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[31:34.31]Is this doing this?
[31:37.39]What is this having to do?
[31:39.95]What is this?
[31:40.71]I can't even speak.
[31:42.53]I'm dead.
[31:57.44]Holy shit.
[31:58.08]That's insane.
[32:00.46]That's hard as fuck.
[32:06.27]Wow.
[32:07.25]Okay.
[32:08.61]I'm going to turn on continues.
[32:09.77]I'm turning on continues.
[32:12.18]Yeah.
[32:17.64]When continue is on, replay is going to... It's okay.
[32:22.92]How many continues?
[32:27.12]How about like two continues?
[32:31.51]One continue?
[32:32.89]That's all you're going to let me have here is a one continue?
[32:41.78]I'll try it with one.
[32:46.04]Look, this is an arcade game.
[32:47.31]Back in the day, I would just have to put 25 more cents in.
[32:52.95]By the way, Red Lemonade gave five community subs.
[32:56.23]Thank you, Red Lemonade.
[33:01.24]What's wrong?
[33:02.88]The default setting has changed.
[33:04.18]High scores will not be saved.
[33:09.08]Wait, hold on.
[33:09.96]People want me to click on this image very badly.
[33:11.90]Let's... Okay, I'll give it to you.
[33:13.48]I don't... What is this?
[33:20.67]What... Why is this like... Did you... Did you copy and paste a book?
[33:26.17]And put it down one strip?
[33:34.38]It's Play Dome.
[33:37.68]Okay.
[33:38.44]Play...
[33:45.02]I couldn't even see until I zoomed in.
[33:48.80]You should take his advice.
[33:55.38]How many credits do I have?
[33:57.01]Alright, that shit is fucking hard, man.
[34:01.23]Alright, let's try this again.
[34:07.37]This is fun, though.
[34:09.31]Fun, but hard.
[34:10.19]Fun, but hard.
[34:23.49]Fuck you!
[34:24.19]That was a good start too.
[34:25.55]She doesn't need those continues.
[34:37.24]Just save that.
[34:41.88]Damn it.
[34:42.68]And that's not even the beginning of the level.
[34:46.02]Gift a sub per continue.
[34:49.15]Um, I'm sorry guys.
[34:50.59]It didn't cost five dollars to continue in the arcade.
[34:57.02]You didn't slide a five dollar bill into a machine.
[35:08.59]I gotta pay attention here.
[35:18.92]All right.
[35:19.48]Bingo.
[35:21.05]Bingo.
[35:25.11]Same shit I did last time.
[35:26.07]Remember I was... Remember last time I was going... Not this time.
[35:46.95]Why was I looking at chat?
[35:48.43]Why was I looking at the chat?
[35:49.91]What am I doing?
[35:50.61]I wasn't looking at the game.
[35:53.07]I was looking over at you guys.
[35:56.31]Why am I doing that for?
[36:04.60]Start?
[36:05.14]What's the start button?
[36:09.28]What's the start button?
[36:12.96]What?
[36:17.46]Left click, right click, enter?
[36:18.78]It's not enter.
[36:35.23]Mouse 3.
[36:36.03]It's okay.
[36:36.37]It's middle mouse button.
[36:38.16]Alright, let's go.
[36:49.23]You're playing with a mouse?
[36:51.89]Should I not be?
[36:52.49]Is this like playing Dark Souls with a mouse?
[36:55.21]Is that a bad idea?
[36:55.85]Should I not be doing this?
[36:59.53]Use a controller.
[37:00.35]What?
[37:05.06]Is this dumb?
[37:07.18]This is dumb.
[37:11.20]Okay.
[37:11.90]I'll put my controller in.
[37:12.88]Is this dumb?
[37:15.62]Is this dumb?
[37:16.38]Wait a minute.
[37:31.58]Guys, I don't think a controller can be used.
[37:43.08]Why is my Xbox controller not getting recognized?
[37:49.49]I have my Xbox One controller plugged in.
[37:53.88]Let me try it with the controller.
[37:54.72]See if it's any better.
[38:04.07]Use the arrow keys?
[38:04.77]How is the arrow keys different than WASD?
[38:06.85]It's the same thing, it's just more over to the right.
[38:08.91]Let me try with the controller.
[38:24.41]Alright, here we go.
[38:26.84]They reached the CPU slightly faster.
[38:32.08]What?
[38:36.63]That's absolute horseshit, right?
[38:39.19]That's not real.
[38:42.17]No, right?
[38:42.79]Is that real?
[38:44.61]Okay, no, turn off vibration, for the love of God.
[38:48.82]Alright, how do I do the...
[38:52.06]Okay, let's do... Yeah, I don't know what the... What are the controls, though?
[38:58.98]Okay, A or... A is fire.
[39:00.74]Polarity is B. Okay.
[39:05.36]Release power is right trigger.
[39:06.64]Alright, that makes sense.
[39:09.26]That is kind of true.
[39:10.02]How is that true?
[39:11.22]Isn't the... Isn't the keyboard just... I'm not going to pretend to believe that.
[39:16.22]If you had a keyboard with a PS2 connector, it would be faster.
[39:26.79]I don't believe a word you guys are saying right now.
[39:35.43]Uh, it's... Okay, it actually is a little easier.
[39:42.45]By a little bit.
[39:57.41]Absorb.
[39:59.89]Absorb.
[40:07.07]Jack's activated?
[40:07.87]Not yet.
[40:09.25]Not yet.
[40:09.63]This is riveting.
[40:11.83]Resident sleeper.
[40:12.55]Don't worry.
[40:13.84]Hey, we'll wake you up.
[40:15.52]We'll wake you up in a few hours.
[40:16.42]Have a nice rest.
[40:20.02]Alright, now watch out here.
[40:31.28]There we go.
[40:31.68]Fuck!
[40:32.10]There's another wave.
[40:32.74]Alright, good, good!
[40:37.38]Thank you.
[40:39.34]You're welcome.
[40:39.88]Alright, now we go like this.
[40:48.85]Fuck!
[40:49.15]Okay, I'm fine.
[40:52.29]Same deal, I'm gonna go up that left side.
[41:05.16]Alright, easy.
[41:05.74]Slow down.
[41:08.82]You absorb that, then... I think it's... is it black?
[41:11.74]Yep, black.
[41:14.88]Is it white again?
[41:15.54]I think so.
[41:17.03]Alright, we're good.
[41:19.67]Now is where I have to be... I gotta full charge here.
[41:28.45]What the fuck?
[41:29.87]Did you see that shit come out of nowhere?
[41:36.87]Damn it!
[41:37.40]I'm just gonna stay back.
[41:50.57]Fuck!
[41:53.03]God damn it!
[41:55.55]Shit!
[41:55.99]Your brain just doesn't want to do it.
[42:04.35]It's just confu- it's like scratching your head and patting your ass.
[42:07.88]Whatever that saying is.
[42:08.96]Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man!
[42:26.47]Fuck you!
[42:33.78]All right, here we go.
[42:34.69]I have one health.
[42:45.41]Take it all?
[42:45.83]All right.
[42:49.36]Good?
[42:49.72]All right.
[42:50.32]Let's go.
[42:52.60]He's angry.
[42:53.42]No, I'm not.
[42:53.94]I'm frustrated.
[42:54.62]It's different.
[42:56.14]Okay, so now this one, you got to get the middle.
[42:58.06]Okay.
[43:02.37]You gotta get right there, in the center.
[43:28.40]Ay, caramba!
[43:37.83]What's coming out first?
[43:42.73]Oh, my God!
[43:43.81]Oh!
[44:06.88]I don't get it.
[44:08.44]I don't understand.
[44:08.94]I don't get it.
[44:10.42]Anybody get it?
[44:15.93]Do they have to be out, extended all the way?
[44:18.59]Before I can hurt it?
[44:21.41]This is hitting it, I guess.
[44:29.50]Oh!
[44:30.16]Okay, so...
[44:39.76]I have to fly inside.
[44:41.38]I don't understand.
[44:42.42]I gotta get in there.
[44:43.92]I gotta fly inside the tubes.
[44:52.76]So, okay, will that damage me if I'm the wrong polarity though?
[45:07.68]Alright, this time I gotta be careful.
[45:26.27]There we go.
[45:26.61]Those homing missiles are so good.
[45:27.78]Alright, I got this first part done pretty well.
[45:35.84]That should be good.
[45:36.38]Alright.
[45:49.28]How long do you think he's gonna play this game?
[45:50.59]The whole stream or just another hour maybe?
[45:52.99]Well, it depends on how, uh, if I can even complete it or not.
[45:55.73]We'll find out.
[46:03.23]Fuck.
[46:09.13]I blew it.
[46:09.85]It's alright.
[46:22.31]Oh shit!
[46:23.43]What the hell am I doing?
[46:28.53]Oh, interesting to note.
[46:31.03]From every Steam discussion and review of this game that I've read, most people don't beat this level.
[46:37.71]They go, I've done it after this level too and I can't do it.
[46:41.49]Just want to make that very clear from what I've read.
[46:48.83]It's level 2, which this is level 2.
[46:51.03]I can't... I don't want to write a Steam review about it.
[46:52.97]It's fun, but I can't get past level 2.
[47:01.04]Stay the fuck back.
[47:04.06]Forget about points, just stay alive.
[47:09.28]Oh my fucking god, what have I done?
[47:11.63]I didn't... Why did I kill that thing?
[47:12.83]I should have just left it alive!
[47:25.99]Jesus!
[47:36.35]Okay, go this way.
[47:37.27]Right?
[47:37.49]I don't know.
[47:38.77]Stop!
[47:40.81]Fuck!
[47:42.79]I'm freaking out, man!
[47:47.63]Just make it!
[47:52.25]Stay away from me, please!
[48:05.04]Alright, let's go.
[48:15.43]I need some... I need some shit.
[48:16.69]Absorb that.
[48:18.19]Alright, come on.
[48:24.78]I want Max.
[48:28.32]I got pretty much max 11 11 homing missiles now you gotta get in there man all right I know I gotta get in there man get in there I'll get in there I got one I got one shot
[48:56.82]Oh, what am I thinking?
[48:58.16]Oh, my God.
[48:58.66]Okay, get in there, man.
[49:01.12]Get in there.
[49:02.22]Oh.
[49:02.38]Oh.
[49:25.78]Give me that shit.
[49:31.78]Hold on.
[49:32.16]Slow it down.
[49:32.81]Okay.
[49:33.15]Eat this.
[49:39.73]What the fuck?
[49:44.71]It's so fucking hard.
[49:46.60]Fuck.
[49:47.74]Oh god damn it.
[49:53.64]Yeah, I thought Pickle Rugo was a really fun game, but unfortunately I couldn't get past Chapter 2.
[50:09.77]I'll get it.
[50:10.71]I'll get it.
[50:11.15]I'll get it.
[50:11.57]I'll get it.
[50:11.91]All right.
[50:21.80]Charge.
[50:22.60]Charge it up.
[50:24.64]Restart, restart, restart.
[50:25.82]Hold on.
[50:27.60]Somebody gave $50.
[50:28.09]Hold on a second.
[50:30.29]I just got 5,000 bits right now.
[50:32.93]That's huge.
[50:34.91]I'll take a fucking ship explosion over that one.
[50:37.19]This is from Cabadger.
[50:42.34]This is a nice journalist gameplay.
[50:45.04]I bet you you couldn't beat this in 10 minutes.
[50:48.60]I bet you one fake germicent that you couldn't beat level 2 in 10 minutes.
[50:53.69]How's that sound?
[50:55.46]Who's the real- who's the journalist here?
[50:59.52]Anyways, uh, if you wanna play- if you wanna play- play a shmup, please play Zero Ranger.
[51:05.20]The game is absurdly underrated.
[51:06.74]It's an excellent entry point for newcomers.
[51:08.38]While Ikaruga is one of the great shmups of its time, it requires a whole lot of playthroughs in order to fully understand it.
[51:14.34]It is arguably harder than most Touhou games on arcade mode.
[51:19.93]Zero Ranger is an excellent starting point.
[51:22.01]It's sure to be a crowd pleaser for chat.
[51:23.61]By the way, you can give yourself infinite lives in the options menu, which is fine.
[51:30.18]I love this.
[51:31.30]I love this comment.
[51:33.19]I love this- this bit message, because it's fine if- it's- that's fine.
[51:37.65]It's okay.
[51:38.17]I can do two continues.
[51:42.35]Really appreciate- thank you for the $50, seriously.
[51:48.04]Thank you for the 5,000 fucking bits.
[51:49.12]You know what?
[51:52.68]I actually really do like these kind of games.
[51:55.38]I can get into them pretty easily.
[51:59.04]So, you probably would see a few more of these.
[52:01.42]I mean, Binding of Isaac's one of my favorite games.
[52:03.56]I know, I know, everything's Binding of Isaac to Jerma.
[52:07.90]But, I mean, it's dodging and shooting and... We'll see.
[52:16.20]Let's see if I can get through the hard one.
[52:17.76]If I can get through the hard one, then everything is just like coasting at that point, right?
[52:23.98]Alright, hold on.
[52:24.44]Let me, let me, let's do that again.
[52:25.80]That was fucking pathetic.
[52:34.44]This is level two.
[52:36.47]Yeah, this is the one that people get stuck on.
[52:39.27]I'm, I'm, I'm going hard.
[52:40.95]I'm, I'm gonna try to beat this today.
[52:46.98]Guys, the time to beat, if you know what you're doing, is like an hour.
[52:51.26]There's only like five stages in this game, but they're all just like super tricky.
[53:00.69]Almost blew that.
[53:01.79]That would have been bad.
[53:08.48]Resorbed, but...
[53:14.03]All right, I want to take... All right, all right.
[53:15.59]Got two lives.
[53:17.47]Folk waiting room.
[53:22.85]All right, have you guys noticed that like... There's always apparently a waiting room for another game.
[53:30.22]You know what I mean?
[53:30.88]It's like Ikaruga waiting room, like three days ago.
[53:34.08]Animal Crossing waiting room.
[53:35.62]And then I played it.
[53:36.54]Oh, Viva Pinata waiting room.
[53:38.06]And then I played... You know what I mean?
[53:39.36]Like you... Take a number.
[53:48.21]I can't believe it.
[53:49.04]Where's Viva Pinata?
[53:50.72]He's playing Viva Pinata now.
[53:52.12]Get this game out.
[53:52.74]This game sucks.
[53:54.78]Where's Ikaruga?
[53:56.36]Oh, Ikaruga.
[53:56.86]Ikaruga waiting room.
[53:59.22]Oh, here's Ikaruga.

[54:05.74]This game's dumb.
[54:06.96]Fucking Mario 2 waiting room.
[54:13.15]There's not much room in the waiting room.
[54:24.24]waiting room.
[54:25.30]Get out of here with that!
[54:26.92]I'm gonna beat this!
[54:32.55]It's this part right here.
[54:34.49]This is the tricky one.
[54:36.03]Just stay the fuck back.
[54:40.11]I just forgot how to change polarity.
[54:50.20]Oh shit!
[54:52.56]Oh shit!
[55:02.21]Oh, fuck!
[55:02.94]I forgot what I'm doing!
[55:04.28]Oh, fuck.
[55:07.76]Oh, that sucks.
[55:09.20]It's alright.
[55:21.09]Okay, eat him up.
[55:21.87]Eat him up, eat him up, eat him up, eat him up, eat him up, and eat him up, and, and, and, and go.
[55:25.41]And then eat him up.
[55:26.41]Good.
[55:36.82]Good.
[55:37.24]Good.
[55:37.78]Good.
[55:38.32]Good.
[55:39.00]Alright.
[55:39.26]I've got... Look at how much... I've got plenty of time.
[55:41.29]I've got plenty of health.
[55:42.15]Come on!
[55:53.19]What the fuck are you thinking?
[55:54.73]I'm so mad.
[55:55.63]I'm actually pissed off at myself right now.
[55:57.61]I'm fucking furious right now.
[55:59.43]I'm so furious.
[56:01.11]I am so angry you can't even tell.
[56:03.53]Yes, you can.
[56:06.55]Okay, get the... I got like fucking three lives for this shit.
[56:11.25]He's seething.
[56:12.12]I got it.
[56:13.06]I gotta beat level two.
[56:13.88]I have a question.
[56:29.74]So when I dodge like that, does it... I'll ask it later.
[56:45.75]Do I have a frame invincibility on that shit?
[56:47.61]Holy fuck.
[57:06.30]Come on, fire it!
[57:07.86]Oh, you idiot!
[57:24.71]Just give me a chance.
[57:29.86]It's firing at me.
[57:34.90]Oh my god, what happened?
[57:36.26]Oh, I hit the back.
[57:36.81]It's okay.
[57:43.37]Oh my fucking god.
[57:51.40]I have a question.
[57:54.01]Oh my, I thought I was going to die if I went in there with this.
[57:57.87]I ran out of time.
[57:58.45]I don't know, I thought it was a... I thought it was like a fucking, like a beam or something.
[58:14.18]Like if I went in there, it was going to kill me.
[58:15.66]If I was the other polarity.
[58:25.64]I figured that because I didn't know.
[58:27.32]I thought if I walked in there, it was like, they're gonna kill me.
[58:30.82]Alright, now that makes this way easier now.
[58:33.23]Not easier, but you know.
[58:35.47]This game's fucking good.
[58:37.21]I like this.
[58:46.13]So those are, okay, I have actually, an actual question.
[58:50.10]Is this considered one of the harder shoot-em-ups that have come out?
[58:53.44]Is it?
[58:54.14]Like, just be real with me.
[58:55.00]Is that real?
[58:57.24]I want to know if I'm going up against, like, the hardest.
[59:08.42]Yep.
[59:08.90]Yep.
[59:09.36]All right.
[59:09.58]Good.
[59:10.12]Good.
[59:10.92]That's how I want it.
[59:16.06]Treasure games are regarded very difficult.
[59:17.78]Yeah.
[59:19.00]I get this.
[59:19.44]I'm not going to do it on hard, but, you know, we'll do it with one contingent.
[59:23.89]You literally ignored 70% of chat.
[59:27.23]Well, 70% of you fucking guys are just making shit up.
[59:30.09]70% of you guys probably have never heard of this game until 12 minutes ago.
[59:35.37]So, uh... Sorry.
[59:38.05]Excuse me.
[59:48.92]Oh no, he knows.
[59:50.21]Of course I know!
[59:56.85]Oh shit, he knows.
[59:59.72]Oh my god, why the fu- Alright, no more reading chat ever again.
[60:04.20]I'm just wasting lives for no reason.
[60:14.89]Kill, kill, kill.
[60:16.73]Swim.
[60:17.94]Kill, kill, kill.
[60:19.16]Swim.
[60:19.54]There are probably people that fly all around the edges here and kill everything.
[60:28.01]I think that's not me.
[60:32.87]I gotta be careful again.
[60:33.81]Just don't fuck it up.
[60:35.00]Don't be an idiot.
[60:59.61]Alright, this part always fucks me up.
[61:11.32]Just go forward.
[61:12.14]Don't worry about anything.
[61:13.04]Just get up there.
[61:13.84]Don't do shit.
[61:18.67]This just to go now?
[61:23.51]I'm too high strung for this shit.
[61:24.87]I really am.
[61:35.98]I know I should be switching polarity and yeah, yeah, yeah, but whatever.
[61:44.88]Holy fuck.

[64:28.78]And then shit in my pants.
[64:34.56]And let me get this straight.
[64:35.71]All this because you're upset at a video game.
[64:39.07]Is that what I'm understanding here?
[64:41.59]Yes.
[64:43.03]Okay.
[64:44.03]Just make sure I'm clear.
[64:55.05]What?

[65:46.31]Stage three, waiting room.
[65:47.67]All right.
[65:49.69]What happened?

[66:23.08]So I'm just going to give myself 100 continues.
[66:24.68]All right.
[66:29.82]So I'm going to give myself like five continues.
[66:36.19]I get a continue.

[67:11.16]Just do free play?
[67:11.84]Because who cares?
[67:13.12]Oh, but then I can just do it forever.
[67:15.54]That's super cheating.
[67:20.70]Alright, five lives, three continues.
[67:23.86]That's normal.
[67:24.96]That's normal.
[67:26.78]That's normal.
[67:27.42]That's what I'm doing.
[67:36.68]You need 25 lives to beat this.
[67:41.51]Just do infinite, we won't judge you.
[67:43.35]Yeah, right.
[67:46.43]There's no way I don't get judged.

[68:32.39]I do remember that.
[68:36.94]But what happens when the guy comes in with, like, $20 in tokens and fills the whole thing up like I just did?

[79:57.28]You know that, right?
[79:59.00]A majority of the stream now is just, look at the streamer's fucking mirrored face.
[80:04.68]This is no longer an Ikaruga stream.

[89:56.27]Red, green, blue!
[89:57.99]And the other ones!
[90:30.00]I'm just testing you.
[90:30.78]I'm just, like, testing you to see if you think you're fucking big in skulls when I do.

[91:36.53]I really thought that one was going to be the end of me.
[91:38.79]What am I... Alright.
[91:39.95]Why am I doing like a fucking Malcolm in the middle?
[91:44.45]Why do I keep addressing the camera?
[91:48.43]Why is this like my video diary right now?
[92:02.36]You're not the boss of me now.
[92:05.22]You're not the boss of Vino.
[92:08.02]And you're not so... Cool.
[92:23.11]Hold on, I heard a ship!
[92:35.29]Polarity in my pants.
[92:36.95]What the fuck are you saying?
[92:38.45]I mean, no.
[92:41.29]Alright, stop.
[92:41.87]We're just going for one side.
[92:54.17]Worth it.
[92:54.89]Switch sides.
[92:55.75]Check it out.
[92:57.05]Boo!
[93:05.82]That's how you fucking get it done.

[93:58.97]I can't escape.
[94:00.03]I can't.
[94:00.41]That's my escape chute.
[94:02.36]It only does one.
[94:14.81]What's... You should play Lisa the Painful.
[94:21.07]Did anybody just say that or am I making that up to be annoyed?
[94:33.33]Alright, easy.

[94:36.26]Easy!
[94:36.94]Easy!

[96:00.54]Polarity shift.
[96:02.84]Go back.
[96:05.22]Go back!
[96:11.37]Little... the little guy!
[96:14.51]Alright, I got plenty of continues.
[96:15.83]I'm good.
[96:33.00]Alright, switch.
[96:33.66]Polarity.
[96:36.62]Where the fuck I hit the button with my fat ass finger?
[96:47.41]Yo.
[96:57.49]Ah!

[98:21.42]Oh.
[98:23.36]Oh, it's... It's like... It moves fucking faster!
[98:50.07]Oh shit, it's going the other way.
[99:01.26]Go this way instead.
[99:06.06]Oh my god.
[99:07.14]I'm fucking running into shit.
[99:17.07]I don't know if it continues.
[99:26.54]Dude, this is un-fucking-believable.
[99:29.76]This shit is, like, so fucking difficult.
[99:32.80]Like... Spin!
[99:42.87]Fuck!
[99:44.43]I had so many fucking... Alright, that's it.
[100:00.68]Delay one side?
[100:01.56]I can't.
[100:02.06]I tried it before.
[100:02.98]I need to get this off.
[100:04.70]This is like, I'm annoying you.
[100:06.74]I'm annoying me.
[100:07.42]Give me that chain.
[100:23.17]You're making it better.
[100:27.88]Give us more.
[100:28.78]There's no more room to put more.
[100:30.56]What do you mean you want more?
[100:46.40]I can't do more.
[100:54.11]Add a reverb.
[100:55.63]You just made me die!
[101:07.25]Why would I add a reverb?
[101:08.71]That's the... Why would you... Why do you want that?
[101:15.05]I... You don't want this.
[101:18.72]Nobody here actually wants me to do this.
[101:20.98]Besides you.
[101:22.16]You're the only person in the room.
[101:24.00]When I said, who wants a reverb?
[101:25.48]And there's 10,000 fucking people in this audience.
[101:28.28]I see one hand and I go, that's all right.
[101:30.34]Let's get it on there.
[101:34.65]Invert the colors.
[101:42.00]Make it for different polarities.
[101:44.06]I don't think I can do that.
[101:46.48]One white and one black.
[101:48.28]I don't think I can do that.
[101:51.09]I can't do like a monochrome thing.
[101:55.57]It won't work.
[102:00.12]Negative.
[102:01.60]That's going to hurt your eyes.
[102:10.89]I can't.
[102:12.07]All my webcams are packed.
[102:25.83]There.
[103:07.83]Now wait.
[103:10.77]Make one delayed?
[103:11.71]I can't unless I have another webcam.
[103:13.85]I seriously would love to do that.
[103:16.15]I really would.
[103:17.41]But I need a second webcam because it takes the source.
[103:21.56]I can't do it.
[103:27.14]The reason why I could do that before is because I had another cam.
[103:32.54]Turn one upside down.
[103:35.46]Get a sec- I don't- it's- everything's packed.
[103:37.62]I don't have anything.
[103:39.96]I wonder if I could- fuck it, can I split this?
[103:41.84]Let me see.
[103:48.89]No, I can't.
[103:50.69]It's the same source.
[103:54.63]Add more.
[103:58.21]No, I can't do it.
[104:00.39]Add ambient audio effects.
[104:02.80]Oh fuck, I'm still on reverb!
[104:06.05]No, not four more.
[104:07.19]No, no, no, not four more.
[104:10.15]No, no.
[104:11.43]You're getting this for a little while.
[104:14.94]No, not prototype mode.
[104:20.14]Back up.
[104:21.48]No, how do I get the fuck out of here?
[104:25.90]How do I...
[104:45.01]Where's the... What the fuck is happening?
[105:00.06]There we go.
[105:09.36]No, I don't want to see the fucking credits.
[105:14.06]Alright, here we go.
[105:15.42]Now I'm going to play.
[105:17.86]This hurts my head.
[105:19.26]I know.
[105:19.66]I blame the 15 people that said to do this.
[105:22.80]And I'm turning it off soon.
[105:27.79]Alright, let's go.
[105:28.35]The one on the left just doesn't make any sense.
[105:41.50]I changed where the thing is on the screen.
[105:44.93]I don't like that.
[105:45.43]Put it back.
[105:45.79]Where was it?
[105:46.49]Put that back.
[105:48.05]Was it six?
[105:48.65]Right there.
[106:01.52]Keep it.
[106:04.36]Alright, this is the one.
[106:05.32]I'm going to get past chapter three.
[106:08.58]I really should play chapter three on its own and practice it.
[106:22.59]That's the correct thing to do, yes.
[106:24.93]If I get past Chapter 3, then I'm gonna pick Chapter 4 and I'm gonna practice Chapter 4.
[106:48.97]Choose your fighter.
[106:51.89]Select your character.
[106:54.50]Let me take you for a ride.
[106:58.38]I want to take you for a ride.
[107:00.78]Now let me take you for a ride.
[107:07.72]You know, when I was younger, you know what I thought that they were saying?
[107:12.04]I thought that instead of take you for a ride, I thought they were saying, I want to shake you boom boom bye.
[107:20.02]I want to shake you boom boom bye.
[107:23.73]I was like fucking 13.
[107:25.23]I don't know.

[113:04.76]How much is a webcam?
[113:07.30]This is, you're talking, this is a real investment.
[113:10.42]A decent webcam is like 60 or 70 bucks.
[113:14.17]I can do like full HD 60 FPS.
[113:16.87]It's like $60.
[113:17.17]So this is going to be thousands of dollars.
[113:25.10]Just get really garbage ones.
[113:26.66]Yeah, but they might not be able to even get pulled through.

[129:07.03]5,000 bits from Phylactery.
[129:10.65]Phylactery says, buy the webcam, slave.
[129:12.65]This is pleasing to chat.
[129:16.01]I'm gonna get him.
[129:16.79]Well, I'm gonna do that as soon as I can.
[129:19.73]This is, this is absurd.
[129:26.09]I have to stay on one polarity.
[129:27.25]I can't change it.
[129:33.15]And then they start coming in.
[129:35.71]Holy fuck.
[129:44.99]My lord.
[129:49.83]Use the shields to your advantage.
[129:51.79]I'm kind of an itchy head right now.
[129:53.99]Hold on.
[130:06.55]This game was designed to take $50 from each person that wanted to try to play it.
[130:34.84]Where's the safe place to stand here?
[130:37.04]I hope I get back here with ten fucking continues.
[130:55.62]Is that it?
[131:04.03]Of course not.
[131:20.46]Holy shit.
[131:54.42]Come on, stinky.
[131:55.28]This is a baby game.
[131:58.54]Multiply mics.
[131:59.56]I can't do that.
[132:01.87]Oh my god, you're killing me.
[132:03.95]How many are there?
[132:32.50]What is that?
[132:34.94]What was that?
[132:35.92]What was that?
[132:36.56]I don't even know what it was.
[132:38.99]What happened?
[132:43.45]What it was?
[132:44.27]That was the game audio?
[132:46.39]Why is the game audio coming through?
[133:09.77]This is all fucked up.
[133:11.11]Because of the mixer.
[133:15.77]How about this?
[133:16.21]Did that change anything?
[133:24.18]No.
[133:26.88]No, it's fucked up.
[133:27.72]I can't do it.
[133:29.34]Just add a chorus.
[133:31.16]Might as well just do this.
[133:34.02]This is a potential best joke of 2020.
[133:36.78]I would hold on to that because there's going to be 30 fucking webcams attached here.
[133:43.87]This joke is going to absolutely run its entire course.
[133:48.63]Yeah, I can't do it.
[133:51.16]Yeah, it won't work.
[133:54.16]I got this fucking mixer here.
[133:55.34]It's all screwed up.
[133:58.42]29 and I'll be furious.
[134:00.02]Alright, let me try to figure out this fucking chapter 4.
[134:03.37]You have 30 USB ports.
[134:04.85]I'll just get a... I'll get an extension.
[134:08.18]Hopefully... I have to be careful because... If I have a USB extender with, like, an extra 10... Right?
[134:20.79]You know what I'm saying?
[134:21.49]Like, would that work?
[134:24.73]I need enough, like, bus spots, right?
[134:27.00]Whatever they're called.
[134:35.64]It needs to be an active extension.
[134:38.90]Well, whatever.
[134:40.48]I gotta pee.
[134:56.90]Fuck.
[135:08.45]Oh, man!
[135:16.52]Try to just not fire at all?
[135:38.73]Does the wall?
[135:39.51]Yeah, but they come down this wall.
[135:41.94]Behind the wall, they still fly in.
[135:49.30]I'm just doing 1,000 continues.
[135:50.56]I don't care.
[135:58.59]I'm literally going to put on 99 continues.
[136:10.58]You can call me a cheater if you want to.
[136:12.14]This is fucking crazy.
[136:16.93]They've already taken like $30 of my tokens at this point.
[136:20.29]Can I sit back here?
[136:22.89]What if I just... Hold on.
[136:23.73]What if I just sit back here?
[136:25.78]Wait.
[136:26.04]Hold on.
[136:30.40]I probably should only go... I'm gonna only shoot for the... I don't know.
[136:34.86]This is fucking outrageous.
[136:37.79]Left Jerma could have done this.
[136:41.09]Fuck, man, this is so fucking crazy!
[136:45.05]Left, right, left, right, left, right, while switching polarity?
[136:48.87]Like, right, right, left, left, right, right, left, left, right, right, left, left, right, right, left, left, right, right, left, fuck!
[137:02.98]Right, left.
[137:14.11]This is a $500 game.
[137:16.15]Like, you gotta spend $500 to beat this.
[137:17.59]This is one of those scenarios where the guy... You know when you went to the arcade and you would get the cup?
[137:38.01]Because it didn't fit in your pockets how many tokens you got.
[137:41.34]There's somebody with a big fucking big gulp cup sitting on top of this desk.
[137:46.17]On the cabinet.
[137:49.53]And they're just like... And the thing weighs like fucking three and a half pounds.
[137:56.65]Like that... It's a big unit.
[137:59.90]And this probably has like two or three hundred tokens in it.
[138:05.94]Call me a cheater if you want.
[138:06.80]I just want to see the... I want to see the boss.
[138:08.36]Call me a cheater.
[138:08.80]I don't care.
[138:37.51]Remember, there's a line of people behind you.
[138:38.93]Man, they're all small, but look at them.
[138:44.02]Did I just exit the game?
[138:47.36]What just happened?
[138:57.74]Alright, let's go.
[138:59.12]It's time.
[139:00.00]Chapter 4.
[139:02.14]Chapter select.
[139:03.48]I'm beating this shit.
[139:04.54]Even if I have to fucking use powers.
[139:10.59]Wait, I should do arcade mode then, right?
[139:20.72]Somebody said, you're 5'8", lol.
[139:22.60]Yeah, and somewhere like fucking 700 million people on the planet.
[139:28.46]Oh, wow.
[139:29.72]Oh, I can't believe he's 5'8".
[139:31.92]That's like the same size as a billion people.
[139:45.09]Why does he sound so... What?
[139:53.21]Uh, Tom Cruise is fucking 5'7".
[139:55.51]Following him.
[139:57.39]That motherfucker like saves the world But what I am talking about in this movies what I can't they make him stand on boxes Guys I'm fucked up
[140:29.12]Energy max.
[140:31.40]This is pretty good.
[140:31.98]This is a pretty significant play in this game.
[140:33.72]Doesn't matter.
[140:35.22]I have infinite lives.
[140:36.20]We're just going to beat the fucking game right now.
[140:47.93]Doesn't count?
[140:48.49]That's okay.
[140:50.75]Whatever.
[140:51.05]Whatever.
[140:55.16]This game is pretty cool, though.
[141:00.24]This game is really good.
[141:10.93]How is it not dead?
[141:24.46]It's uber.
[141:27.40]Play with 99 lives instead of Infinite Continues.
[141:30.26]I think I were already past that vote.
[141:31.78]I just want to see the bosses and stuff.
[141:34.60]Look, I'm playing on, like, story mode.
[141:42.59]Play Mario Paint?
[141:45.21]Is that game good?
[141:48.15]Is that like the Looney Tunes one for the Super Nintendo?
[142:12.20]Come on.
[142:13.04]Come on, Ikabuga.
[142:18.74]Energy back.
[142:19.98]Energy back.
[142:21.80]Energy back.
[142:23.99]Back.
[142:26.99]My grandma can play this game better than you.
[142:34.73]Oh, yeah?
[142:48.71]Challenging.
[142:49.81]Rewarding.
[142:58.85]Why is this stream under puzzle category?
[143:04.29]What?
[143:07.79]This is under... Why is it under puzzle?
[143:15.29]English, puzzle, shoot'em up.
[143:17.17]I didn't do that.
[143:22.32]Oh, that's another thing we can do.
[143:24.12]Okay, so I'm gonna write this down.
[143:25.80]On the 30 webcam stream, we're gonna do a German jigsaw puzzle with my whole body.
[143:32.38]I'm gonna, like, just stand, and we're gonna try to put me together.
[143:37.41]Sounds fun.
[143:38.05]Alright.
[143:38.55]By the way, we're doing this in, like, we're doing this in, like, less than five days.
[143:42.73]You understand?
[143:43.15]This is happening, like, within the next week.
[143:45.41]I fucking promise.
[143:46.79]We're doing this, like, this, like, probably next weekend.
[143:49.33]I swear to God, this is too interesting for me.
[143:59.59]don't give me hope no there's no way that doesn't happen if I can connect I might need another computer right I might need to get another computer like a laptop which also has like seven or eight usb buses feed that video through and control them like I'm gonna need like probably three computers right
[144:27.64]Laptop with eight?
[144:28.60]What happened?
[144:29.44]What did I leave the game for?
[144:32.62]What just happened?
[144:39.84]What just happened?
[144:46.99]Why did that just kick me out?
[144:50.73]I lost?
[144:52.81]No, I didn't.
[144:55.49]It was on chapter select?
[144:59.07]No, it was not.
[144:59.57]Because it goes on free play?
[145:10.66]It was?
[145:11.30]No.
[145:12.04]Fuck.
[145:12.48]I can't believe it.
[145:14.02]No, it wasn't.
[145:14.58]Pretty sure it was.
[145:17.48]Fuck.
[145:18.26]One player game arcade.
[145:23.52]Arcade.
[145:26.16]It was on it.
[145:27.96]Arcade normal.
[145:34.96]German forgot his homework.
[145:35.74]He didn't tell us why he never was going to play Lisa.
[145:38.95]I just, well, I told you yesterday because I don't want to.
[145:44.59]What?
[145:46.67]Didn't I say I don't want to play?
[145:50.87]I'm not playing Odama right now.
[145:53.63]I got to figure out how I'm going to do this webcam thing.
[145:57.21]Does anybody know, realistically, how many actual video devices you can pull through something like OBS?
[146:04.64]Without having a separate computer?
[146:06.22]All that, like, that speed?
[146:08.98]What is it, like, four or five?
[146:10.52]At least, yeah, it's at least two.
[146:11.92]It's probably, it's probably like five or six.
[146:13.90]Twelve?
[146:23.33]OBS allows at least Odama.
[146:25.13]Fucking god!
[146:40.61]Kill the big one on the left, and then the big one on the right.
[146:43.79]Did you check the toilets on the left?
[146:45.20]Did you check the toilets on the right?
[146:46.26]Did you check the toilets on the left?
[146:47.12]Did you check the toilets on the right?
[146:47.98]Did you check the toilets on the left?
[146:48.84]Did you check the toilets on the right?
[146:49.70]Did you check the toilets on the left?
[146:50.52]Did you check the toilets on the right?
[147:03.79]Do do do do do do do do do do!
[147:07.07]He's uncracked.
[147:07.83]He's uncracked.
[147:08.75]He's uncracked.
[147:09.87]He's uncracked.
[147:10.96]No, he's not.
[147:12.24]He's uncracked.
[147:31.51]He's uncracked.
[147:32.73]He's uncracked.
[147:34.11]Okay, stop.
[147:40.78]Morning, morning, morning.
[147:48.43]Hair flip.
[147:53.70]Boring, boring, boring.
[147:56.50]Shut up, all right?
[147:58.12]Shut up.
[148:11.04]kill that one.
[148:11.70]What do you think I'm doing?
[148:19.77]I'm killing.
[148:20.55]We want blood.
[148:23.17]We want explosives.
[148:24.25]We want blood.
[148:49.06]I'm fucking crazy.
[148:52.73]This is why the webcam's never on.
[148:54.19]You guys understand?
[148:54.95]Do you get it now?
[148:55.93]Do you actually get it?
[148:56.63]Alright, so why am I not going to Chapter 2?
[149:09.44]This is fucking me up.
[149:13.94]I thought it was because of nudity.
[149:14.94]Well, it's both.
[149:16.28]It's because of both.
[149:16.92]Okay.
[149:18.72]Boss battle bonus.
[149:20.02]I did it.
[149:20.48]Score.
[149:21.26]Axe chain.
[149:21.90]Grade C. Moving on to chapter two.
[149:25.63]I don't... What the fuck was that?
[149:27.43]That was weird.
[149:28.07]All right.
[149:28.67]Let's beat this whole damn game.
[150:00.70]double.
[150:01.98]Please stop swearing.
[150:03.14]Please stop.
[150:03.78]Alright, I won't.
[150:05.12]If you hear me swear one more time, I will give one community sub for every F-U-C-K you hear, okay?
[150:16.67]Only that one.
[150:25.43]Only for today, by the way.
[150:27.75]Only today.
[150:29.71]Only today.
[150:31.41]Today only.
[150:33.35]For the next five straight minutes.
[150:51.51]Come on, say it.
[150:54.61]Fun!
[150:56.35]I am having fun!
[151:10.81]And now he's having fun.
[151:14.35]I heard a... I heard a rumor over there, and typically I would say the F word.
[151:20.70]Not today, though.
[151:46.06]Whoops.
[151:46.30]Got it. Got it.
[152:01.82]Eat em all. Eat em all. Eat em all. Eat em all.
[152:10.82]Shmup.
[152:15.00]When is he eating a shoe?
[152:22.30]I'm not eating a shoe.
[152:24.38]Sorry.
[152:28.15]I'm not eating a shoe.
[152:32.19]Pardon to the mic.
[152:48.00]No.
[152:48.22]All right, let's do this one.
[152:58.21]Why did I read that?
[152:58.97]I don't know, because the chat's going real fast and I'm reading random shit.
[153:26.39]What the fuck, man?
[153:51.56]Whoa, I got the whole thing.
[153:55.52]Oh, whoops!
[153:59.58]That's a sub!
[154:00.94]That's one.
[154:04.58]I... I... completely forgot we were doing that.
[154:10.43]I don't... I completely forgot.
[154:14.91]That's one.
[154:16.03]Alright, you get one.
[154:18.23]I'll... I'll... I'll pay up at the end of the stream.
[154:22.76]Just get me to the end of the stream.
[154:23.86]Just get me to the end of the stream and I'll get you.
[154:41.14]I already have a sub.
[154:42.18]I want another one.
[154:42.92]3D?
[154:43.96]3D!
[154:52.86]Gimme another one.
[154:53.56]A greedy!
[154:55.97]Alright, I'm just like fucking... That's two!
[155:22.75]Are there speedruns of this game?
[155:23.69]Do they run this at stuff like, um, HDQ or anything?
[155:28.03]I feel like this would be crazy to watch somebody do this and not get hit.
[155:36.54]There's speedruns for every game.
[155:42.43]That might be inaccurate.
[155:43.49]That might not be accurate.
[155:50.48]I'm not sure that's accurate.
[155:52.36]It's something that nobody's speedrunned before.
[155:55.46]Right?
[156:13.19]Alright, let's go.
[156:28.58]I got funky.
[156:31.65]I didn't say I said funky.
[156:45.12]So I ran out of quarters and what I ended up doing is I opened up the machine.
[156:51.66]The front of the machine where the coins go.
[156:54.65]And there's that little tab that registers the coins.
[156:58.57]And I got in there and went... And then I closed it up.
[157:01.45]That's illegal.
[157:01.97]Not if you own the arcade, it's not.
[157:02.89]Not if it's my place.
[157:22.34]After hours, the business is closed.
[157:24.00]I want to play Ikaruga until I win!
[157:25.62]What do you mean illegal?
[157:34.83]Hold on.
[157:35.33]It's illegal for me to open up an arcade cabinet that I own after hours and jiggle the coin thing to get a hundred lives.
[157:45.78]No, it's not!
[157:47.38]I own the machine!
[157:57.26]I own the machine.
[158:04.30]The machine owns you.
[158:05.78]What?
[158:17.86]Now that... Okay.
[158:19.54]Doesn't matter.
[158:23.35]Okay, I'm just playing so sloppy now because when you know that there's nothing to fear, I'm just like, whatever.
[158:29.50]I can just die a bunch of times.
[158:30.98]I own the fucking arcade.
[158:32.26]This game is kind of hard.
[158:35.12]Alright, play for real.
[158:40.70]Let's go.
[158:51.91]I mean, this is fucking hard as shit.
[158:53.51]It is.
[159:02.11]Jeez.
[159:03.34]Give it up for four.
[159:07.32]Four what?
[159:08.72]Oh, four subs.
[159:09.76]I mean, that's the technique.
[159:24.85]Got it.
[159:32.89]Where's the blood?
[159:33.49]This game sucks.
[159:45.11]Look at me.
[159:45.77]Times 20.
[159:58.26]Shit.
[160:05.56]These shmups, I swear.
[160:06.74]These shmups are so difficult.
[160:12.39]Replay, by the way.
[160:13.45]Omega low.
[160:15.41]Oh, shmup.
[160:20.50]Hey, you shut the shmup up!
[160:39.50]He's learning.
[160:40.32]He's learning.
[160:41.14]God, finally, he's learning.
[160:43.76]Alright, I gotta slow down.
[160:46.62]I'm probably freaking some of you out right now.
[161:06.46]Mm, I... There's nowhere to go.
[161:07.84]It's just coin... It's just coin stealing.
[161:10.37]It's just stealing coins at this point.
[161:27.19]Oh.
[161:35.16]What even fucking hit me?
[161:36.84]Five.
[161:47.89]Oh my god, this is crazy.
[161:51.29]I feel like this is the part of the game where, like, if you speedrun the game and you get hit once, it's over.
[161:55.56]You hate this part.
[161:58.42]You probably sit there and go, this is the worst thing.
[162:01.04]I just gotta make sure I don't get hit.
[162:02.26]I gotta be careful.
[162:03.18]This is the worst one.
[162:12.58]This is easy when you know.
[162:14.12]Yeah, I guess when you know, you just know, right?
[162:17.54]But this part in particular is freaking me out.
[162:19.40]Should I follow the beams?
[162:20.74]I mean, I guess this is kind of, sort of... It's just too many colors on the screen.
[162:33.11]My brain can't look at it.
[162:41.32]It's too many colors.
[162:44.06]They're just full... It's... I feel like I'm playing, like, Guitar Hero 12 times in a row.
[162:49.89]Like, on five different screens.
[162:52.43]And five different songs.
[163:10.34]Give us a good reason why you don't want to play Lisa.
[163:16.68]Because I said so.
[163:37.11]Okay mom.
[163:45.90]This is it.
[163:46.76]This is where we separate the gamers from the... Whatever.
[163:51.83]I don't know.
[163:59.65]Hard game.
[164:04.90]I feel bad for that guy that wrote that Steam review that doesn't realize you can put it on free play mode.. I feel you, man.
[164:10.85]You and I are in this together.
[164:19.04]What?
[164:23.08]Jeez.
[164:28.40]Okay.
[164:29.13]It's just don't move, but it's... You have to.
[164:36.29]I only have 13 seconds left.
[164:40.61]I'm gonna die from time!
[165:01.11]Uh, did that come back?
[165:02.51]Do I get more time?
[165:05.25]Oh, what?
[165:05.51]What happens here?
[165:06.63]Is that going to start the countdown at three seconds right now?
[165:12.36]No, it's not, right?
[165:16.88]It's like a timed mission.
[165:17.88]Alright, here we go.
[165:21.94]Okay.
[165:34.75]Oh, man!
[165:35.63]This is fucking... This is ridiculous!
[165:49.30]You have to... You have to move!
[165:51.26]You have to move!
[166:05.80]Dude.
[166:10.14]I can't even switch polarities in time.
[166:23.14]I'm gonna run out of time.
[166:52.15]Yo, kill him!
[166:52.87]Kill him!
[166:53.21]I have 10 seconds!
[167:12.54]Lame.
[167:13.00]What do you mean lame?
[167:13.86]That was pog.
[167:22.07]Didn't I say I was gonna go pee, like, two hours ago?
[167:24.17]I did, right?
[167:32.72]You're a cheater.
[167:36.00]Tell me whatever you want.
[167:37.40]I'm
[167:44.47]That's a big chain.
[167:45.31]20 chain.
[167:45.69]Oh...
[168:19.40]Ooh, big boy!
[168:37.13]Would you play Dark Souls 3 with infinite health?
[168:40.90]Not even a fair comparison.
[168:46.23]I make you alive so that you can walk along the right way, but you can't understand it.
[168:49.87]What, is this the brain?
[168:50.87]Right in the middle.
[169:05.18]You play Dark Souls with infinite health.
[169:08.28]No, I wouldn't.
[169:09.64]But that, that, that's... You're wrong.
[169:32.38]Damn.
[169:33.76]Okay, I guess I'm wrong then.
[169:38.64]You can't feel the visible things.
[169:39.90]How can you feel the invisible things?
[169:44.49]This is pretty sick.
[169:45.91]Wait, let him grab me?
[169:47.25]Oh, no.
[169:55.76]This shit is fucking wacky.
[169:59.05]That's wacky.
[170:06.83]You got him.
[170:10.28]That's wacky, man.
[170:12.68]Oh, there's no way you beat this normally unless you put in 500 bucks.
[170:16.98]There's no way you do this normally without $500.
[170:53.33]It is impossible to cut off this metamorphosis forever.
[170:55.30]Can you see?
[170:56.02]Can't you?
[171:21.92]Do I have to destroy something?
[171:32.25]Holy shit!
[171:35.71]Absorb!
[171:37.25]Absorb!
[171:38.23]Fire!
[171:39.56]Absorb!
[171:40.10]Fire!
[171:47.06]I-
[172:22.00]That was a disgusting empty win.
[172:39.22]Oh, that's not it.
[172:40.12]That's not it.
[172:40.62]Can you imagine if I had gotten here and beat... Wow, good thing we didn't do that.
[172:44.13]Can you imagine if I had gotten here and just didn't do this?
[172:55.03]What am I supposed to do?
[173:08.66]Dude You want to absorb for points?
[173:13.60]I gotta get to at least four million
[173:43.28]Remain bonus.
[173:47.23]Plus 500,000.
[173:48.59]4.785 million points.
[173:51.63]He keeps forgetting basic mechanics.
[173:54.13]No, I'm not.
[173:55.15]It's just lights are filling every inch of the screen.
[174:07.56]This is a hollow victory.
[174:09.28]Maybe for you.
[174:10.74]Not for me.
[174:12.87]Is this what we wished for?
[174:17.29]Don't worry.
[174:17.73]We will understand each other someday and the life has succeeded into a distant future.
[174:21.70]What the fuck is happening?
[174:24.28]There was like some kind of story here?
[174:31.90]Ikaruga.
[174:33.50]That was fucking fun.
[174:35.51]Hey, I beat the first three levels without cheating.
[174:39.25]That's a
[174:41.76]Hey, if I'm allowed to take- if I take up 66% of the screen, I'm allowed to cheat for 66% of the game.
[174:50.80]Because the 66% of the stream has been me.
[174:53.26]I'll be right back, I gotta pee.
[177:40.68]Okay.
[177:42.72]So I'm going to make you all real sad right now.
[177:47.54]Well, hi.
[177:47.92]I'm going to make you all real sad.
[177:50.49]I've got a lot of shit to do and I've got to stop.
[177:59.11]Sorry, these last few streams have been like three to four hours, but they have to be.
[178:04.11]I'm sorry.
[178:04.65]That's the way it is.
[178:06.25]But I will tell you, I'm going to work on something very, very important.
[178:12.60]When I get back.
[178:14.38]Now, I know you're not going to want to hear this either, and I don't want to say this either, but like I have to do so many things I have to do.
[178:19.04]I'm sorry.
[178:21.24]I have to.
[178:21.86]I'm going to have to do another small leave of absence here.
[178:27.17]Another couple of days.
[178:29.05]Another two or three days.
[178:30.13]And then we'll hopefully be back to normal.
[178:32.41]I'm sorry.
[178:33.05]I know.
[178:33.29]I'm sorry.
[178:33.91]I know.
[178:34.21]I know.
[178:34.58]I know.
[178:34.82]I know.
[178:35.06]I know.
[178:35.28]I was just gone for like five days.
[178:37.16]And we just did three here.
[178:38.90]And they're shorter.
[178:39.52]I know.
[178:40.20]Trust me.
[178:40.58]I know.
[178:40.86]I want to stay.
[178:43.92]But.
[178:45.88]I forgot I'm like over here.
[178:47.42]I'm like leaning in.
[178:48.60]But.
[178:52.17]Wink to make up for it.
[178:56.77]I... Here's what you can look forward to.
[179:00.50]The next stream... Where's the calendar?
[179:04.82]When I come back... You ready for this?
[179:10.14]Are you ready to hear this?
[179:13.33]The next stream will be on Thursday or Friday, probably Friday.
[179:17.43]And I am going to do whatever I can to make it possible to do the webcam stream on Friday.
[179:27.25]And then Saturday and possibly Sunday, Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[179:34.66]That's the plan for this weekend.
[179:39.92]Finally, Hulk Ultimate Destruction waiting room.
[179:45.92]There you go.
[179:47.78]If I can get that- I'm so interested in that webcam stream.
[179:51.49]So, like, not only am I gonna go do a bunch of other shit, but I'm gonna do a ton of research into how I can get, like, at least 10 to 15 webcams pointed at me and- and captured.
[180:02.92]But with that, I am go- you're going to see- here we go, we're gonna disappear here.
[180:07.78]Who's gonna be left?
[180:09.04]Alright, place your bets.
[180:10.74]Place your bets.
[180:11.22]Which one's gonna be the last one remaining?
[180:12.92]I'm just going down the list and deleting them.
[180:15.85]Who's gonna remain?
[180:18.32]Whose light's gonna turn off last?
[180:23.61]Top right?
[180:24.23]That's cheating though.
[180:30.45]It wasn't even top right!
[180:32.35]It was this guy!
[180:33.21]Who's this guy?
[180:38.74]Oh, it's me!
[180:41.62]How many community subs do I have to give?
[180:44.68]Six?
[180:44.90]Seven?
[180:45.40]How many?
[180:46.94]Seven?
[180:51.47]Nine?
[180:51.91]Where are you getting nine from?
[180:55.41]Nine?
[180:55.91]Are you adding numbers on?
[180:57.11]Why do I look so weird?
[180:59.45]Oh, it's because I'm flipped.
[181:01.51]It was nine.
[181:02.23]Was it nine?
[181:02.85]You're adding nine?
[181:06.81]Are you adding?
[181:07.55]You're adding them, are you?
[181:08.25]You did a lot of sevens.
[181:11.35]It was nine, you greedy...
[181:16.21]I'll just round it up to 10, whatever.
[181:18.23]That's all good.
[181:20.13]Sure.
[181:20.85]I'll help you out here.
[181:22.23]Fuck.
[181:23.71]Fuck.
[181:24.21]Fuck.
[181:24.67]See, there you go.
[181:25.17]I have 7, there's 7, 8, 9, 10.
[181:26.97]We're gonna do 10.
[181:28.19]Do it right now.
[181:32.10]So, those of you leaving, I'll see you guys on Friday.
[181:35.26]Sorry again for the very short streams I've been doing recently, but it's very necessary.
[181:43.43]We're going to have a ton of fun on Friday.
[181:47.45]The fucking webcam nonsense stream is going to be pretty fun.
[181:52.80]Unless it's all fucked up and doesn't work, and then you'll hear me complain about it for about 45 minutes while I play Cooking Mama 2.
[181:59.50]There you go.
[182:06.73]Let me give subs.
[182:12.80]Actually go to the outro.
[182:14.90]So people know that I'm an outro.
[182:16.12]Ikaruga is actually, that's a really good game.
[182:18.70]That's a really cool mechanic.
[182:19.84]It's a classic.
[182:21.64]I'm glad I played half of it.
[182:25.26]I'm glad I played half of that game and then cheated for the rest.
[182:29.39]Alright, gift community subs.
[182:30.61]Where is it?
[182:33.33]Fun, fun, fun, fun.
[182:35.51]Gift a sub.
[182:36.79]You've gifted, you've given 791 gift subs.
[182:38.81]When?
[182:44.46]When have I given... I've given 800 subs?
[182:46.78]What?
[182:47.24]When?
[182:47.52]I remember a couple... There was the one time when I did 500, like, a couple months ago.
[182:53.89]A month ago, right?
[182:56.03]That was, like, two weeks ago.
[182:56.93]Oh, shit.
[182:59.09]Okay.
[183:00.37]Alright.
[183:01.09]Gift subs.
[183:02.17]10 gift subs.
[183:02.71]Here they come. 10.
[183:14.44]And there it is.
[183:17.58]You gifted 10 tier one subscriptions.
[183:20.11]That puts me over 800.
[183:21.17]That puts me at 801.
[183:25.49]Just giving money to Twitch.
[183:32.11]Yes, that's pretty much what I'm doing.
[183:38.83]But anyways, let's do the subs and the bits and everything.
[183:41.49]Thanks again for sticking around.
[183:44.88]Hope to see you again soon.
[183:47.92]On Friday, specifically.
[183:49.83]Specifically on Friday.
[183:54.15]I'm so pumped up for this thing.
[183:55.43]I'm going to do whatever it takes to make this work.
[183:58.02]Even if I have to get like two or three computers in here to get this to work, I'm going to do it.
[184:03.22]I gotta get, like, a list of just weird shit to do.
[184:06.40]You know what I mean?
[184:08.66]Like, the human puzzle, right?
[184:11.35]Scramble them off, try to put together the fight in the room, like the brawl.
[184:15.23]There's, like, at least five 15-minute bits here that will last us a good hour or two.
[184:26.29]Can't wait for Cooking Mama, right?
[184:27.79]Alright, let's do this.
[184:33.55]We have 250 from Hole of One Zombie.
[184:35.47]Thank you, Hole of One Zombie.
[184:36.85]Let's turn the volume up a little bit.
[184:38.19]It's a little low.
[184:39.95]That's better.
[184:45.08]It occurred to me that yesterday's Viva Pinata was like when you ask for a Power Rangers toy for Christmas, but get a bootleg Wild Ranger instead and proceed to cry.
[184:53.34]It was great fun, though.
[184:56.88]What was wrong with Viva Pinata?
[184:58.44]It was a good game, man.
[185:01.02]What's wrong with it?
[185:02.09]It was Viva Pinata.
[185:03.21]It wasn't like... What?
[185:06.03]Whatever.
[185:07.75]Thanks for the $2.50.
[185:09.77]LM, man, thanks for the $2.50.
[185:13.11]Earthworm Jim was the hardest character to make, for sure.
[185:19.70]Because painting his whole head took so long because of how long it took to load every single spray on his head.
[185:30.10]Yeah.
[185:30.30]Every little detail on his face and shit just took so much stupid amount of time because of how that game loads layers.
[185:35.30]I think he turned out alright, though.
[185:45.34]Thank you to Gnarly for the 250.
[185:47.18]Hey, I'm glad you took my advice yesterday and did some more crack before today's stream.
[185:51.38]Loving this new crack era of JermaStreams.
[185:53.52]Keep up the great work.
[185:54.32]Wait, wait, wait.
[185:54.80]Are we... Boston era, Vegas era, crack era.
[185:58.71]Is that where we are?
[186:01.17]Why does that chain of events sound very realistic?
[186:07.51]Dude, that's fucked up.
[186:09.50]Oh, Boston!
[186:11.18]Vegas!
[186:13.62]Now he's on... That's... Alright, well, see, in like seven or eight months, when I'm not like... It's like a Christian stream, and I'm like a Christian guy, and I really like the Bible and stuff.
[186:33.58]Thanks for the $2.50, though.
[186:36.06]Dinner Master, thanks for the five community subs.
[186:37.84]Missed it earlier, but thanks for the five subs.
[186:42.98]Thank you, Dinner Master.
[186:44.19]That's a pretty great name.
[186:45.31]Dinner Master.
[186:48.07]Uh, Dungeness, thanks for the $5.
[186:50.15]Just want to let you know that you look like a shorter version of Shaggy from that live-action Scooby-Doo movie, L-U-L.
[186:55.69]Okay, yeah.
[187:01.49]Okay.
[187:03.39]Hey, Dark Soul, thanks for the $2.50.
[187:06.64]Local streamer buys out all stock of webcams during pandemic.
[187:09.86]Family's now unable to Skype video chat grandma.
[187:28.25]Actually webcams are super expensive right now.
[187:30.65]What?
[187:30.89]What are you talking about?
[187:33.45]Are they?
[187:36.03]Wait, is there like a webcam shortage right now?
[187:39.46]Am I about to pay like insane premium prices?
[187:43.08]No, right?
[187:45.40]No.

[188:50.57]Just that general camera.
[188:54.19]Is $189 right now.
[188:55.20]Oh my god.
[189:02.84]Isn't this thing usually like 20 bucks?
[189:04.94]Really?
[189:05.54]Oh no.
[189:06.16]Can I not do this?
[189:10.11]There's only one of these.
[189:13.83]What?
[189:15.39]Do it on eBay?
[189:16.67]Yeah, but eBay will take forever to get here.
[189:20.24]If I do eBay, it will take like two weeks for this shit to get here.
[189:23.18]Alright, I'm going to have to keep looking into this.
[189:27.32]Because some... Oh boy, these are all so... These are probably not going to work.
[189:34.65]$329 fucking dollars.
[189:35.55]You aren't kidding.
[189:39.67]I love how this one is webcam 1080p with microphone and cover.

[190:18.23]It's in stock.
[190:19.89]If I buy 10 of these and they don't do anything, what the fuck am I gonna do?
[190:27.16]I'll figure this out over the next couple days.
[190:28.92]I gotta figure out if this is even possible now.
[190:31.46]Well, Cookin' Mama looks real fun now.
[190:38.01]The world's supply of webcams.
[190:41.31]Alright, I'll, uh, let's keep going.
[190:47.06]Let's keep going.
[190:47.66]I'll see if I can figure this out.
[190:50.65]Thanks for that heads up, though.
[190:51.47]I didn't even realize that.
[190:52.67]I didn't even think about that.
[190:56.71]That was Dark Soul.
[190:59.45]Dark Soul gave us the heads up.
[191:04.07]Bowl of one zombie.
[191:04.86]Thanks for 250.
[191:05.66]I came back and thought you'd gotten all the power-ups.

[191:14.01]Hey, the plushie, thanks for 250.
[191:15.47]Congrats, you got Luigi'd all the way through Bowser.

[191:26.86]And hang out.
[191:28.56]Sometimes.
[191:30.78]Freshly brewed cider.
[191:33.64]Thanks for the 1500 bits.
[191:36.02]$15, they say.
[191:36.39]If you sat in a puddle of your own piss long enough, would your legs disintegrate?
[191:43.87]Why would your legs disintegrate?
[191:51.40]P... P is just water and all the extra vitamin C that you didn't process.
[191:56.60]That's all it is.
[192:00.04]It's just P and vitamin C. That's it.
[192:10.30]It's like...
[192:20.37]Jeremiah is too IQ- if- okay.
[192:23.03]I know we fuck around a lot here.
[192:24.65]We do, we really do, but if you really think that I think that human urine is water and vitamin C, I don't- I can't help you there.
[192:35.63]I can't- do you think I really think that?
[192:42.46]Do you think I actually think that water and vitamin C is piss?
[192:49.99]No, it's that smelly stuff that's in the cleaner.
[192:55.88]Bleach.
[192:57.22]Water and... whatever it is.
[193:04.26]Whoa, that would fucking be horrible.
[193:07.62]Hey DarkSoul, thanks for the $2.50.
[193:09.04]Pretty unbased that you refuse to collab with Caron.
[193:12.32]Just saying.
[193:12.86]Kind of cringe, you know.
[193:14.12]Pretty stupid.
[193:14.82]Just saying.
[193:15.28]Ha, just kidding.
[193:15.87]Great stream streamer.
[193:16.77]Keep up the streams and stop fucking cheating.
[193:18.53]One more sub.
[193:22.33]Alright, we're talking about collabs.
[193:29.33]I fly solo until it's necessary for me to want to do anything with somebody else.
[193:36.34]We already talked about this.
[193:37.24]I don't have plans to do any collabs.
[193:39.54]It's just if they happen, they happen.
[193:42.08]I go, I'm solo.
[193:43.33]This is solo act.
[193:45.07]One man show.
[193:51.82]Han Solo.
[193:53.04]And he was the coolest character in that whole show.
[194:00.57]Okay, I just saw Jerma985 gave 10 community subs, and I forgot, and I thought somebody, I don't know, I thought somebody had the same name as me.
[194:07.99]I was about to thank Jerma985 for 10 subs, and I was like, wait a minute, that's me?
[194:12.10]I just did that.
[194:12.68]All right.
[194:15.90]That's like five times more.
[194:17.02]What?
[194:41.15]I was gonna like start saying like oh here and then you threw that in there and now I'm all you fucked me all up Okay Well, I hope we don't get there
[194:58.66]I really hope that that doesn't happen.
[195:00.18]I hope that over the next few months we can really just try to get back to normal.
[195:05.64]Hopefully there's a vaccine comes out sooner than later.
[195:10.06]I know people are thinking it's maybe the end of the year or early next year.
[195:12.98]Hopefully we make it to there.
[195:16.44]Slowly we get rid of this shit.
[195:18.08]That's what I hope.
[195:18.82]That's what I really want.
[195:19.74]Right?
[195:20.84]Everybody wants that.
[195:24.46]We've been told like 12 to 18 months for a vaccine.
[195:29.86]And now hopefully, over the next few months, cases start to slow down.
[195:36.59]That's the number one thing.
[195:39.17]Once you're in a pandemic, people are going to get it.
[195:42.33]It's going to spread.
[195:43.05]That's what a virus does, right?
[195:44.49]But to try to make it so it doesn't spread everywhere to everyone is what we're trying to do.
[195:57.01]Be careful.
[195:58.21]Especially if you are in direct contact with people that are susceptible to the illness, right?
[196:04.32]Like, if you have older people, people with underlying conditions, right?
[196:08.18]I mean, I know I'm saying the things that you've already heard, but we have to say it.
[196:11.44]We have to think about it.
[196:12.18]We gotta talk about it.
[196:13.30]Gotta be fucking careful.
[196:14.78]Take care of yourselves.
[196:15.56]Wash your hands.
[196:17.44]Don't get too close to anybody, right?
[196:26.23]Just don't spread the damn thing.
[196:27.53]That's the bad part.
[196:28.23]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[196:40.13]A block in my neighborhood had a block party yesterday.
[196:44.55]What the hell are they doing?
[196:51.41]What?
[196:51.67]That's... That doesn't make any sense.
[196:56.56]Hey, you know, there's like this big virus going around that, like, it's really starting to, cases are starting to inflate in, in the, in the country.
[197:04.79]You know what a great idea would be to, like, put myself with a bunch of other people and as, as many people as we can get in the same place and let's all sing songs out loud.
[197:23.38]That's like how it spreads.
[197:31.27]And I know the thing is, I'm not gonna get it.
[197:33.83]I'm not gonna get it.
[197:35.41]Right, but if you touched a surface, or you came into contact with a doorknob that had it on there, and then you don't get it, but you give it to somebody else, and they get it, that's how this happens.
[198:00.25]You might not get it, but you might be the reason why 30 other people do.
[198:18.41]Jeremy, you literally just kissed someone.
[198:20.58]No.
[198:26.31]Just be careful, don't- don't do any of that shit.
[198:29.54]There's no reason for like- I've seen like the photos of like the beaches and people are like fucking on the beach.
[198:38.60]Like let's play- hey, let's- let's play tag on the beach!
[198:42.67]No, what are you doing?
[198:44.53]Go home!
[198:53.61]But anyways.
[198:56.80]I really hope that we can hit, I, we need to hit a, we need to hit that flat, like they say, flatten it, flatten it.
[199:04.72]We're gonna see more cases, but just, we gotta fucking make it so hospitals don't get overrun by people, that's the main problem, right?
[199:14.78]I know it's like, oh, it's like the flu.
[199:17.22]It's like a bad flu.
[199:18.72]It's a lot of what a lot of people say.
[199:19.98]It's just like the bad flu.
[199:21.02]It's all good.
[199:22.48]Yeah, but when fucking 100,000 people in the same city get it at the same time, and 20,000 of them need potentially to go to the emergency room, that's the problem.
[199:40.65]That's the issue.
[199:43.45]Right?
[199:44.21]It's a big part of it.
[199:58.15]People are dying from this.
[199:59.15]Yes, they are.
[200:01.43]It's not just old people.
[200:03.22]It's younger people too.
[200:06.86]It's mainly about making sure our hospitals don't get overrun.
[200:13.26]Because when you're out of beds and you're out of ventilators and somebody comes in and they need one and you don't have one, you don't have a bed for that person.
[200:24.50]That's where it gets very bad.
[200:33.31]Yes, that's why it's important to stop the spread now.
[200:35.45]Yes.
[200:37.51]Exactly.
[200:38.01]You guys get it.
[200:43.93]I don't want to continue to... We can move on from this, but... It is good to talk about sometimes, just to make sure kind of everybody's on the same page.
[200:55.96]It is a current fucking huge problem right now.
[201:01.64]Take care of yourselves.
[201:06.40]Wash your hands.
[201:06.94]Stay safe.
[201:11.48]Moving on.
[201:14.35]We had 400 bits from Sergeant Chicken Wing.
[201:16.86]Thank you for those.
[201:18.80]$4.
[201:20.14]Jeremy, kind of out of the loop since I missed a couple streams.
[201:22.00]Why all the short streams lately?
[201:23.34]Are you moving again or did I miss something?
[201:24.80]Yes.
[201:26.67]Kim and I are in the process right now of moving.
[201:32.75]We're anticipating.
[201:34.43]We did a lot of stuff last week to get ready and start getting out.
[201:39.13]And over these next probably six to 15, seven to 15 days, we hope to be finally completely out completely.
[201:49.42]The issue and the reason why it hasn't happened already is because, because of what we were just talking about with the coronavirus, a lot of stuff is a lot slower.
[201:58.30]Whether that be trying to find apartments, or a house to go to, or services that you need for a, for a new place, it, it's, everything's very, slowed down a lot.
[202:13.15]So, it's, we're trying to do it as best we can.
[202:18.19]No more webcams, no.
[202:20.80]If Las Vegas is so good, how come there's no Las Vegas 2?
[202:25.09]Why would there need to be a... What?
[202:32.83]But that's why they've been shorter.
[202:34.75]I anticipate that the... After this coming weekend...
[202:42.87]So let's say after like somewhere around the first week of April, second week of April, I plan to be back to normal with streaming.
[202:53.95]And that means obviously streams that are more than four hours long.
[203:00.10]Back to kind of that normal, like six to seven, six to eight.
[203:05.28]We'll see.
[203:05.58]That's, that's the plan.
[203:13.17]But also, there's nothing to consider.
[203:15.75]I might try something in the future here when this is all said and done.
[203:25.53]Typically, this stream is live three or four times a week.
[203:32.02]For about six to eight hours, right?
[203:35.92]I was thinking, maybe...
[203:39.84]what if that turned into like four or five days a week but pulled back to about three or four hours of strength I was trying to think of and that though there's a reason why the only reason why I say this is because the last three or four days remember we talked about how much the cost of chondritis and this potential like arthritis shit is like fucking me up sitting down for more than a few hours
[204:10.50]When I get up after these three, four hour streams, I feel okay.
[204:15.68]I feel alright.
[204:17.38]And I think that sitting down and being in the same place for more than six, seven, eight plus hours is... I think it's not helping, let's just put it that way.
[204:30.58]And until I can have some type of solution where I have a standing desk where I can really just move around, I might try it.
[204:39.01]Maybe.
[204:40.77]I haven't made a decision on it yet.
[204:43.55]But I was thinking about it.
[204:47.45]You know, like, four or five days a week for, like, three to five hour streams, instead of three days a week, eight hour streams.
[204:55.28]Or eight plus, whatever you want to call them.
[204:59.18]I'm trying to figure it out.
[205:03.70]Do yoga breaks?
[205:05.48]Yeah, the thing is, though, when you get into something...
[205:08.82]If I'm gonna sit here and stream and I'm into something and I'm having fun and I want to stick around it... Getting up for 20 minutes throws me off.
[205:19.83]Like, I'd like to just kind of sit here and do what I want to do.
[205:25.41]I have not decided that that's gonna happen.
[205:27.51]But it's something that's floating around.
[205:29.65]Just want to let you know.
[205:35.16]Yeah, it would be more frequent but shorter.
[205:38.35]Rather than less frequent, but longer.
[205:41.93]But we'll move on.
[205:44.44]Thank you, TheStickyStickMan, for the 250.
[205:46.20]Hey, Jerma, first time catching the end of a stream from over here in Europe.
[205:49.70]Thanks for keeping us entertained during this tough time.
[205:52.25]Hope all goes well with the move.
[205:53.39]Stay healthy.
[205:53.97]You as well.
[205:54.65]Thank you for... kind words.
[206:02.13]Need to gain muscle and eat properly.
[206:04.07]I eat fine.
[206:06.27]I eat at least two green vegetables every day.
[206:09.79]I mean, it comes out of a can, but I still eat them.
[206:13.09]Alright, let's do the credits.
[206:15.31]I'm gonna bump you.
[206:16.01]Whoops.
[206:18.87]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[206:19.61]We'll see you on Friday for, hopefully, the webcam insanity stream.
[206:25.90]If I can get them.
[206:28.26]If I can figure out how to get those.
[206:31.47]If not, then we'll do something else, of course.
[206:37.88]Let's run the credits.
[206:40.50]You should see them any second now.
[206:44.00]These are all the subs from today.
[206:45.84]From today.
[206:52.13]Even with a three-hour stream, there's a shitload of people subscribed, which is insane.
[206:56.45]Thank you, guys.
[207:02.01]Thanks for the continued support.
[207:07.04]You guys give a lot of money.
[207:08.56]As always, thank you.
[207:10.74]Was it only three hours?
[207:11.80]Yes.
[207:12.58]About three hours and 30 minutes if you count the end of the stream here.
[207:17.10]25 minutes.
[207:23.09]Thank you, OneBlondie, for the 300 bits.
[207:25.29]Jerma, I love you.
[207:27.53]Do you, though?
[207:29.72]Are you sure about that?
[207:38.76]Love is a strong word.
[207:40.32]Are you still at 10k subs?
[207:47.00]No.
[207:50.37]No, crossing that threshold was fucking ludicrous.
[207:56.65]We've since come down.
[208:03.22]But still, even after losing those subs from New Year's, it's still a shitload of people that have subbed to the channel.
[208:11.13]There's still a ton.
[208:16.45]Like, it's just, it's still increasing.
[208:20.39]Let's just put it that way.
[208:21.27]And it blows my fucking mind.
[208:26.95]Where are we at now?
[208:27.53]Let's see.
[208:28.17]Let's just tell you.
[208:30.79]Oh, we are at
[208:34.09]We've been hovering this channel.
[208:38.83]It is 7,800.
[208:41.71]Holy shit, yeah.
[208:43.92]So we've come down from 10.
[208:45.86]But 7,800 subs is still a monumental amount of paid subscriptions.
[208:57.10]Even if anything, this is a lot of people.
[209:00.30]That's a lot of subscriptions.
[209:08.48]Somebody said dead channel.
[209:11.39]Oh my god.
[209:13.69]Okay.
[209:19.65]That's fucking funny.
[209:24.39]No, I can't.
[209:25.63]Every time I open up my stream manager, guys, and I look at that, I go, that's fucking... Why?
[209:30.65]That's a lot.
[209:31.29]That's too many.
[209:33.25]That's too many people that are... Okay.
[209:35.83]That's a lot.
[209:37.21]And then I hit the broadcast button.
[209:42.71]Anyways.
[209:44.21]We got one more message to get to.
[209:46.85]Just came in right now.
[209:49.49]Somebody's gonna fucking scream by the house.
[209:51.67]That's fine.
[209:54.16]you guys on friday and we have tar alakrin one of the band wait did I ever unban tar I think I did right thanks for 250 first of all they say germa hi it's tar here one you banned yesterday because you streamed despite my prediction that you wouldn't for the record my original statement was the odds of germa moving and streaming by the end of the week are less than zero which was proven one thousand percent true since you didn't even move
[210:19.46]I can't believe you even banned me temporarily.
[210:21.34]You're a disgraceful streamer.
[210:22.96]There was no sense of justice or honor.
[210:25.20]P.S.
[210:25.48]Love the stream.
[210:26.06]Been subbed for 42 months now.
[210:27.42]Waiting for my three-year badge, please.
[210:32.08]Did you see the... I got... I got the book thrown at me.
[210:39.08]Wait, why did this not... What?
[210:41.38]Oh, sorry.
[210:42.16]I fucked that up.
[210:45.94]Ban him again for calling you out.
[210:48.54]Well, I can't do that.
[210:49.26]I mean, like, we just both walked out of the courtroom with our luggage and shit under our arms and different lawyers.
[210:55.63]Well, I can't, what am I gonna, I can't sue you.
[210:57.97]Okay, if you win the case, and we walk out together from the, uh, and we both, you, okay, it's over.
[211:04.01]You have been found guilty.
[211:05.45]When I walk out, if you look at me and, like, go, mmm, stick your tongue out and go, ha ha!
[211:11.26]What am I gonna do?
[211:12.28]Bring him back in!
[211:12.94]I wanna sue him for that!
[211:14.84]Can you bring him back in?
[211:15.72]I wanna sue him for that!
[211:17.26]No, that's not how it works.
[211:25.10]Guilty in a civil case.
[211:26.67]Omega lul.
[211:31.31]Spite sue.
[211:32.99]A spite sue.
[211:38.47]I'll fucking sue you.
[211:40.85]I'll sue you, motherfucker.
[211:42.89]Just wait.
[211:43.67]Alright, let's raid somebody.
[211:49.48]You won't see me for a few days.
[211:53.84]We got Kiwo.
[211:54.42]Oh, Kiwo!
[211:55.46]Kiwo.
[211:57.24]I never catch Kiwo ever streaming.
[212:02.35]Kiwo's awesome.
[212:07.24]Because I never end my streams.

[212:16.53]Yeah, we'll raid Kiwo.
[212:17.53]Go say hello.

[213:28.66]Fuck you.

[213:32.24]Are you crazy?
[213:34.78]Are you out of your mind?
[213:37.91]Do you have any idea?
[213:39.19]Do you have any idea the repercussions of the insanity that could... No, no.
[213:51.60]Be polite to Kiwo, yes.
[213:53.16]Fuck, no, no.
[214:00.74]It's nothing to do with, like, politics.
[214:03.40]It's just, I'm not comfortable doing that.
[214:06.79]I'm not.
[214:08.71]I don't want to do that.
[214:09.59]I'm not comfortable doing that.
[214:10.91]Okay, we're going to go say Kiwo.
[214:12.05]Say hi to Kiwo.
[214:12.67]Okay, Kiwo isn't Bernie.
[214:14.83]That's alright.
[214:15.38]That's okay, but Kiwo's cool too.
[214:17.72]Kiwo is also very cool.
[214:18.88]I mean, Bernie's cool, right?
[214:20.12]Like, where is Bernie?
[214:21.22]He's streaming on Twitch.
[214:21.94]That's fucking awesome.
[214:22.78]That's cool.
