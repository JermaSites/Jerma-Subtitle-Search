[ve:61.7.100]

[00:08.70]Oh, hello.
[00:11.41]Pardon me, just one moment.
[00:18.53]Good to see you again, all of you.
[00:23.01]Of course you know who I am.
[00:24.67]I know who you are.
[00:27.16]It's me, P.F.
[00:28.10]Bugleberry.
[00:29.42]You saw your favorite person in the world.
[00:33.04]I am here to show you a few wonderful things.
[00:38.13]magical three of which don't want to drop my magical potions but what is it what's the matter there's there's too much reverb but it's like me I don't I I haven't even gotten started yet just give me one moment oh
[01:09.43]Hold on, wait just a second, hold on a minute.
[01:15.76]Reverb.
[01:16.08]That what he said.
[01:22.62]Hold the book upside down for God's sake.
[01:25.78]Reverb, reverb, reverb.
[01:30.80]That's it.
[01:33.62]The smell of, the smell of diminishing echo.
[01:38.26]Take that very quickly.
[01:41.37]That's one tablespoon of riboflavin.
[01:48.47]That's good.
[01:48.99]Is that even correct?
[01:50.61]I believe it was.
[01:55.11]One dash of mouth droppings.
[02:04.74]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:11.49]A batwing, which I have here somewhere.
[02:17.05]Batwing.
[02:22.34]And of course cave moss.
[02:24.40]Cave moss from a cave that I explored.
[02:28.68]All these ingredients I explored.
[02:32.74]Many times over.
[02:36.05]Just like that.
[02:40.66]Now this should... I know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[02:45.62]Everybody relax.
[02:49.52]All done.
[02:51.57]With one touch of the head.
[02:56.11]One, two, three, carrot!
[02:58.41]All done!
[03:03.75]As they say, bottoms up.
[03:21.70]Hello?
[03:31.01]Hello?
[03:31.65]Can anybody hear me?
[03:34.87]Can anybody hear what I'm saying?
[03:37.95]Hello?
[03:38.95]Yes?
[03:39.87]Are we fixed?
[03:43.29]Is it better?
[03:45.35]Oh, that is such a breakthrough.
[03:47.33]That's quite a breakthrough.
[03:48.75]The spell of diminishing echo, I have to write that.
[03:53.47]Make sure it's etched with blood.
[03:57.46]Anyways, let me just briefly tell you what we're doing now that you can possibly understand.
[04:03.64]As you know, I'm Bea Fugleberry.
[04:06.22]I'm here to show you my cauldron of acid, my cauldron of demonic fluid.
[04:11.68]And in this, we will be creating
[04:14.51]Spells, monsters, creatures of the likes of which you have absolutely never seen.
[04:20.51]I can guarantee you that one.
[04:23.61]I'm your host, Beagle Mary.
[04:25.77]Let us begin, shall we?
[04:28.00]The first recipe that I would like to create for you is one that I'm sure you're going to be very interested in.
[04:37.50]It is a spell of secret drink that everyone knows the ingredients to.
[04:45.49]And I'll start with a little bit of nutmeg.
[04:48.33]Nutmeg flavoring.
[04:49.81]Oh, no, that's not right.
[04:51.01]That's musk of muskrat.
[04:52.63]Gotta get that one right, Bugleberry.
[04:55.29]This is it.
[04:55.97]Make sure I have the label right.
[04:58.89]Yes, this is nutmeg.
[05:01.30]A dash of nutmeg into the cauldron it goes, whispering, billowing, screaming in a way, yearning
[05:16.18]for its brothers and sisters to join the pot with it.
[05:20.08]Next is lemon-lime peel.
[05:23.08]There's a lemon peel here.
[05:25.52]And we go like this.
[05:26.14]We go bam!
[05:27.12]We go bam!
[05:29.88]Up next is two ounces of corn syrup, which I believe this is.
[05:36.47]We have some flavored corn syrup here.
[05:43.05]There it is.
[05:45.35]A dash.
[05:46.69]A dash of caramel coloring, which is this way here.
[05:51.80]There it is, a dash of caramel color.
[06:01.80]And then we Ster.
[06:04.78]We Ster.
[06:06.66]And we end up with a beverage that I trust you will let put this down.
[06:10.96]I really want to get into this one here.
[06:15.20]What do those witches say?
[06:16.24]What do those witches say?
[06:18.04]Double, double, toil and trouble.
[06:22.11]We don't actually say that, you know.
[06:25.09]We don't actually do those things.
[06:26.79]Why would we say double, double, toil and trouble?
[06:31.51]I don't understand.
[06:32.16]It doesn't make any sense to me.
[06:42.08]I believe it's ready to test.
[06:45.26]So, let's see how the cotton's on it, shall we?
[06:57.17]Looks like it's the right color.
[06:58.45]That's a good smell.
[07:01.03]Let's give it a taste.
[07:09.90]Just like the real thing, I bet you can't tell a difference.
[07:12.98]I bet you couldn't tell a difference.
[07:15.48]Let me upload this to YouTube on a science channel.
[07:21.42]This is technically a science channel now.
[07:23.40]I mean, I am creating all kinds of spells and creatures that you will see very soon.
[07:33.35]That's the recipe.
[07:34.67]Hold up.
[07:35.47]I don't want to say the first word.
[07:40.41]I'll get arrested.
[07:44.48]So coming up next,
[07:47.40]Oh, if you wondered, ladies and gentlemen, where the characters that Gerber creates, where they come from, oh, do I have news for you.
[08:03.71]He has nothing to do with it.
[08:06.33]He commissions me, and I create the creatures, I create the characters, and I create many other things that he uses.
[08:16.46]Don't let him fool you.
[08:17.74]Don't let him do that.
[08:19.46]So we're going to make some now, because that's why I'm here.
[08:22.90]I'm here to show you the process, my thinking, how I do things when I create these characters.
[08:31.18]The first character we're going to make, we'll see.
[08:34.37]I want to see if you can guess who they are before they come out.
[08:39.39]First up, we're going to use... Let me get it right...
[08:46.86]One walrus whistle.
[08:52.00]And it's been dehydrated many times over.
[08:59.00]If you don't spin it, it won't work.
[09:02.91]One can of Pringles.
[09:10.45]I don't have those.
[09:12.53]What can I substitute?
[09:15.03]One concentrated liquid
[09:17.51]from a tomb of the 70s.
[09:19.47]This is it right here.
[09:23.05]As you see, this is from 1976.
[09:24.09]1970... No, yeah, 1977.
[09:24.89]I can tell.
[09:25.35]This is very, very raw.
[09:27.21]Very raw.
[09:28.45]I can't... It's very raw.
[09:29.53]The 1970s, there we go.
[09:31.33]A little extra...
[09:49.50]And then next onto this is wishful thinking.
[09:53.06]Okay.
[10:02.21]And the final ingredient is this.
[10:07.47]Gemma's DNA.
[10:09.05]I collected this up for many years, collecting soda cans and scrubbing his toilet.
[10:19.06]Many times over.
[10:23.26]Plenty of Jerma's DNA to create.
[10:27.14]Let's see who we get here.
[10:30.06]We need quite a bit of this.
[10:32.39]Okay.
[10:36.73]Whoa, whoa, don't be too... Whoa, hold on.
[10:40.11]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[10:43.35]Oh, it's starting to get windy.
[10:45.33]It's starting to get windy.
[10:48.01]Oh.
[10:52.14]There's a few more stairs.
[10:55.44]And then... What's that?
[10:57.02]Come on!
[10:57.30]Rise!
[10:58.10]Rise!
[10:58.24]Mustache, Jerma!
[11:00.26]Where's Chris?
[11:04.20]What you do, Dixie, you do what you're told to do.
[11:10.94]You do what you're told to do.
[11:15.09]I don't know what's going to happen.
[11:19.87]Who are you?
[11:21.15]Who the fuck are you?
[11:23.13]Where am I?
[11:23.85]Why am I alive?
[11:24.83]Why am I alive?
[11:27.61]Why am I alive?
[11:28.95]Why am I alive?
[11:31.43]This way?
[11:35.33]I don't... What do I keep saying?
[11:38.66]Yeah, there you go.
[11:41.40]Now, character registration is on your right.
[11:44.78]Go that way.
[11:47.18]No.
[11:47.62]Oh.
[11:48.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[11:49.13]That way.
[11:49.77]Yes.
[11:51.73]Oh, he's an idiot.
[11:53.75]Didn't put very much brain power in that.
[12:00.95]Our next character that we will be creating.
[12:05.07]This is a popular one.
[12:07.05]Let's start the process.
[12:09.09]I've got to keep this moving.
[12:12.08]Five percent.
[12:14.06]Not that one.
[12:14.76]Not that one.
[12:16.14]There it is.
[12:18.14]five percent of every children's Halloween costume yes a pinch a small pinch of mouse droppings you'll be using these quite frequently that was more than a pinch hey I just
[12:53.10]That wasn't part of the recipe of this one, just to see what that felt like.
[12:57.86]It felt pretty good.
[12:59.94]Strange.
[13:02.09]Very strange.
[13:04.75]Anyways.
[13:07.89]A pinch of purple liquid.
[13:11.37]This is blue, but we put red in already.
[13:16.09]There it is, of course.
[13:20.13]which will be used very frequently.
[13:26.42]And as you see it pillowing, bubbling again like it always does, mesmerizing, hypnotizing goes.
[13:35.02]I'm weak of men, but I am not a weak man.
[13:38.92]I'm a strong man.
[13:41.06]And then all we need to do is wait, Ster,
[13:53.40]And that will give us... Who do you think will be that?
[14:00.83]Characters.
[14:02.79]Arise.
[14:04.53]Arise.
[14:28.38]I don't think that's gonna make it that far.
[14:31.62]I'm not even quite sure a Jerma would be able to use that one.
[14:35.94]It's not that different.
[14:37.74]It's kind of... I tried.
[14:41.21]Maybe he'll make use of it.
[14:42.75]I mean, it is his DNA.
[14:45.59]Coming up next... We have a good one.
[14:54.19]The first on this list is protein powder.
[14:57.41]Protein powder, which I have down here somewhere.
[15:02.33]Well, we can use mouse droppings.
[15:08.35]Protein powder.
[15:09.41]This protein is mouse droppings.
[15:10.95]You just don't know it.
[15:13.09]A small dash of testosterone.
[15:17.23]Lots of it.
[15:18.51]There it is.
[15:19.73]Lots of it.
[15:22.45]A little bit of vitamin D3.
[15:25.76]Which is this one here.
[15:26.86]Let me sample it.
[15:34.79]Yes, it is vitamin D free.
[15:36.33]Make sure you take that, by the way.
[15:38.89]Not enough people get vitamin D in their diet and they don't go in the sun and get the sunshine.
[15:44.13]You need more vitamin D?
[15:46.01]Go get it.
[15:47.92]It prevents a lot of things.
[15:49.56]Helps you with the cold, the flu.
[15:52.70]Makes you feel good.
[15:55.94]A little bit of tanning lotion, which I believe I have some down here.
[16:00.41]Tanning lotion.
[16:04.43]Oh, I'm just pushing my mouse button.
[16:10.45]Tanning lotion.
[16:11.37]Oh, yes, yes, yes, there we are.
[16:14.13]If you didn't know, tanning lotion was made from fig leaves.
[16:18.11]I don't know how accurate that is, but this is not a science.
[16:27.06]A little bit of kosher salt.
[16:28.38]A little bit of kosher salt.
[16:34.64]And finally, the DNA.
[16:41.39]Oh, that was way too close to my face.
[16:48.69]Jehovah, please arise.
[16:50.60]Whatever you have been, whatever you have been, whatever you will do, arise.
[16:58.44]Oh, this is a big one.
[17:00.06]He's a big boy.
[17:01.62]That's a big boy.
[17:03.96]Of course, that's muscle Jerm.
[17:06.28]Here's a big guy.
[17:26.20]Very strong.
[17:26.94]You know, it probably takes a long time in the gym unless you know me.
[17:30.15]Unless you know me.
[17:32.33]And I can make a clone of you.
[17:34.45]Then you can just send your clone in to go out in the town and people will think it was you.
[17:39.35]And you can just sit there and just go like this on your computer and nobody will know it was you.
[17:43.55]Perfect.
[17:46.38]So, the next one.
[17:52.80]This is going to be a doozy.
[17:57.06]I've been waiting to create this for a few months now at least.
[18:02.42]Give or take.
[18:04.16]I was told that this was an important character.
[18:09.22]So let's go ahead and start with the catnip.
[18:13.95]Just a pinch.
[18:14.93]You don't need very much.
[18:17.29]Just a little bit of catnip.
[18:20.45]Kitties love it.
[18:23.95]Some humans do too.
[18:27.64]I see a pinch of catnip, a small amount of lynx venom.
[18:36.48]Lynx venom.
[18:38.52]One of the most powerful, powerful destructive substances on Earth.
[18:45.21]Just a drop will kill a donkey.
[18:48.49]Don't ask me why we always use that term.
[18:51.33]Don't ask me why a donkey has to be the thing we kill to determine how poisonous something is.
[18:58.20]Oh, it's enough to kill a horse!
[18:59.84]Why are you killing a horse?
[19:01.78]What's wrong with you?
[19:03.44]You don't understand.
[19:04.16]You're killing demons.
[19:09.04]Ridiculous.
[19:11.04]Up next we have... What is next?
[19:15.45]I can't read any of my glasses.
[19:18.09]I got some water on me.
[19:21.09]Up next we have... Hare of the Bobcat!
[19:32.36]And finally, oh, Jabba's DNA.
[19:40.33]I might put something else in here to find out Jabba's DNA.
[19:44.07]What will we create this time?
[19:45.81]Arise.
[19:50.95]Doesn't even need stirring.
[19:52.35]It's ready.
[19:53.52]It's just the chemicals reacting into each other.
[19:56.16]Wait.
[20:01.89]Come on out.
[20:04.03]Catboy Jerma.
[20:14.28]Where am I?
[20:20.68]I need to wink into the spirit.
[20:23.04]Why?
[20:25.92]Ow!
[20:26.06]My head!
[20:26.44]My brain just hurt!
[20:28.48]What the fuck is happening?
[20:31.87]What?
[20:32.11]Do I know who you are?
[20:33.55]Just wait.
[20:34.75]Bye-bye.
[20:36.69]Registration.
[20:37.73]Registration.
[20:38.77]Character registration over there.
[20:40.95]Talk to Lucy.
[20:43.31]Talk to Lucy.
[20:44.37]Lucy, she's waving at you.
[20:47.43]Yes, Lucy, thank you.
[20:50.67]The next character we'll be creating is a silly one.
[20:54.31]Ooh, it's cold, I think.
[20:57.31]Wonderful.
[20:58.89]two, three, four, four dehydrated frozen ice cubes.
[21:07.37]I dropped it because it was too cold and I got it in.
[21:10.25]Wow, wowee!
[21:12.23]That was very, very cold.
[21:14.02]Too cold, too cold.
[21:15.64]A little bit of kosher salt.
[21:24.98]The fangs of the ever-living dragon like we used previously.
[21:29.60]This is a diarrhea potion or whatever it was.
[21:35.80]And then, all it takes is a very simple potion, very simple brew, a little bit more of, you guessed it.
[21:44.19]Do you understand?
[21:50.09]Here it goes.
[21:52.31]Ooh.
[21:54.45]Oh, it's getting cold.
[21:56.41]It's getting chilly in here.
[21:57.93]Anybody else feel a breeze?
[21:59.97]Does anybody else feel a slight breeze?
[22:27.05]Wow.
[22:29.01]That was cool.
[22:31.07]That was cool, man.
[22:32.35]Oh, don't do that, actually.
[22:36.46]Yeah, right, right.
[22:39.02]That was cool.
[22:41.02]You got it.
[22:42.20]I know some of you do.
[22:43.08]I see it.
[22:44.48]I see it right there.
[22:45.52]That was a good joke.
[22:46.26]Thank you.
[22:47.94]I do them better than the guy that owns this place.
[22:52.34]So the final creature we're going to make
[22:58.16]I don't even need the book.
[23:01.38]We're going freestyle on this one.
[23:05.51]Link's heaven.
[23:09.33]Clumping kitty litter.
[23:12.51]Captain.
[23:16.18]Mush of the bushcraft.
[23:18.94]I don't even have a recipe for this one.
[23:21.90]Ocean water.
[23:26.66]The caramel coloring.
[23:29.08]We are going to get something extraordinary.
[23:32.98]Oops.
[23:34.58]It's alright, it's alright.
[23:35.44]It was just a catnip.
[23:36.30]Cat stuff's pretty cheap.
[23:38.50]It's not... It's not this stuff.
[23:40.60]Don't drop this stuff.
[23:45.18]Let's Ster it up.
[23:52.83]What are we going to get?
[23:53.79]I want to create my own creature.
[23:57.47]My own...
[24:03.07]And what is it?
[24:05.07]What is it?
[24:05.47]I feel like I'm playing Monster Rancher.
[24:09.21]I saw those Terminator 5 streams.
[24:10.95]They were pretty good.
[24:13.95]Whoa.
[24:15.45]What is it?
[24:18.09]Oh, dear.
[24:18.49]Oh, God.
[24:20.53]Oh, God.
[24:21.09]Oh, no.
[24:21.47]This is horrible.
[24:23.55]Oh.
[24:23.73]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[24:28.78]Oh, he's coming after me!
[24:30.34]Oh, he's fighting!
[24:31.20]Okay, I've got to be ready for this!
[24:34.62]Hey!
[24:34.82]I didn't even give him the name!
[24:37.00]What was his name?
[24:37.98]I don't even know what he was doing!
[24:39.50]Why would he attack me?
[24:42.12]A fish bastard!
[24:44.42]I don't even know what I did, but... I keep putting my hands in here, and it feels... It burned for a little while the first few minutes of the stream, but...
[24:59.02]You need to track him down, Lucy.
[25:00.52]He's on the loose.
[25:03.26]Ow, it hurts.
[25:04.58]But it doesn't hurt at the same time.
[25:06.09]It's very odd.
[25:09.67]Lucy.
[25:11.81]I'm going to do something here.
[25:12.93]That might... I don't... When they were coming out, it looked comfortable.
[25:17.77]Ow!
[25:20.12]Ooh, ooh.
[25:21.32]Ooh, it hurts a lot.
[25:22.54]It hurts a lot.
[25:24.16]But something about this is... Ooh.
[25:27.96]Ooh.
[25:32.09]Something's missing though.
[25:34.71]I like it, but I feel like I should be more comfortable.
[25:38.22]I feel like the atmosphere needs to change.
[25:42.66]My mindset needs to change.
[25:45.76]I'm getting this strong, incredible urge to receive donations and subscriptions.
[25:54.83]I don't even know what that means.
[25:57.98]I don't even- I-I-I've only ever screamed with Germal once.
[26:01.79]Twice, maybe.
[26:04.89]I feel so good right now.
[26:08.35]Oh.
[26:09.47]Something about this.
[26:11.67]I could get used to this.
[26:14.80]Hot diggity dog!
[26:21.56]Lucy!
[26:24.36]Get all this shit out of here!
[26:26.30]Clear this out!
[26:28.22]I want to hang out with the chat now.
[26:30.74]I want to hang out with everybody over here.
[26:33.82]I want to give them... Yeah, clear this out.
[26:36.85]I want you to get rid of that stuff.
[26:40.61]Get rid of it.
[26:42.59]Thank you.
[26:44.64]No, no, go out the back door.
[26:45.96]Go out the back door.
[27:09.79]Don't drop any of those.
[27:11.67]Don't drop any of those potions.
[27:15.07]I saw you.
[27:16.83]You have no idea how hard it took.
[27:19.65]That's 5,500,000 years of my life.
[27:25.84]What do we do?
[27:26.38]Did somebody say I was muted?
[27:33.24]Muted?
[27:33.66]Are we muted?
[27:36.23]I was just yelling at the people with my potions.
[27:38.29]I said, don't drop them.
[27:42.63]They just picked them up and walked out of here.
[27:48.47]They went too fast, is what they did.
[27:51.51]But this is kind of nice.
[27:54.36]What should we do now?
[27:55.18]I mean, this wheel is here.
[28:02.76]I wonder if we should use it.
[28:04.90]Should we use the wheel?
[28:08.73]What's on here?
[28:11.13]Can we get a closer view of this?
[28:19.77]But should we have a reason for this to be on here?
[28:26.36]Let's put an overlay on.
[28:28.22]Why don't we make it fun?
[28:30.34]Let's make it fun.
[28:37.96]This is pretty nice.
[28:41.02]Five subs for a name on a ball.
[28:43.76]Ten subs for a name on my body, which I'm going to have to take this off.
[28:49.44]Eventually.
[28:52.39]Twenty subs for a dance party.
[28:54.21]Oh, I bet you want to see that.
[28:58.25]It's nice in here.
[29:00.87]Without the cauldron bubbling.
[29:02.91]Trust me.
[29:03.81]Why not?
[29:04.71]Why not?
[29:07.10]Without the cauldron bubbling, it's actually pretty nice.
[29:11.45]I really hope that that fish face guy... I hope they catch him.
[29:16.69]I feel like I have a scratch this big right here, right there.
[29:31.10]Wait, hold on a second.
[29:32.98]Did you just say that every single thing has been redeemed?
[29:37.88]It happened already?
[29:39.68]It's only... How many subs was it?
[29:42.81]It happened already?
[29:44.09]This is very liquidy.
[29:47.95]This is very liquidy.
[29:50.57]Already?
[29:51.03]I haven't even gotten my cool shirt on yet.
[29:59.00]Well, we're gonna have to get their names down.
[30:02.24]Zero remaining.
[30:09.62]Apparently people love me!
[30:13.22]Well, let's hope we can get all those on the party before we continue.
[30:18.55]How do I even put this on?
[30:23.89]Oh, if it's good on the back too, this feels good.
[30:30.14]I haven't even gotten the shirt on.
[30:32.54]How many?
[30:36.99]Can you even count?
[30:43.39]Wow.
[30:45.25]My days of potion making should be effectively over.
[30:58.04]Oh, we got some names.
[30:59.92]Oh, there it goes.
[31:03.48]Community Jake, could you come over here?
[31:08.26]I don't even have the shirt on.
[31:11.82]Thank you, community, Jack.
[31:12.84]See, I can hire him, too.
[31:14.64]I can hire him, too.
[31:17.53]I'll go over these names in just a second.
[31:22.83]We just have to spin the wheel.
[31:26.81]Four times.
[31:27.49]I can't do it.
[31:38.64]like this, because what the hell?
[31:41.54]Oh, we have Call Me False.
[31:44.52]Thank you so much for your 10 community subs.
[31:48.14]Also, the great Canadian FK Thug, thank you so much.
[31:54.69]I really appreciate it.
[31:57.21]Thank you to Tipped Over.
[31:59.17]Wow.
[32:00.43]That's your name on a ball.
[32:06.57]Lock me...
[32:10.41]I'm going to say people's names twice.
[32:13.14]Oh, don't look at that.
[32:13.94]Don't look at that.
[32:14.84]It's just not.
[32:15.66]Don't look at that.
[32:20.94]Daddy?
[32:21.38]Oh, no, it's Daddy Big Bucks.
[32:25.41]That's kind of comedic if you think about it.
[32:29.47]It's pretty comedic.
[32:31.95]Blind.
[32:33.99]Blind Irene 1.
[32:35.43]Thank you, Blind Irene.
[32:39.64]Polyhex.
[32:41.28]Thank you.
[32:43.40]Wow.
[32:45.99]I'm not going to put this in again.
[32:47.53]Let's put this here.
[32:50.31]Oh, and we also have EcoLeach.
[32:52.23]Thank you.
[32:52.73]There's no more of these remaining, by the way.
[33:00.93]At this point, we didn't get enough balls to do this with.
[33:05.59]Throw them in.
[33:08.39]Good.
[33:09.36]Good.
[33:10.20]Alright.
[33:10.72]Oh, that went in the eye.
[33:13.60]Fames.
[33:14.44]Wow.
[33:15.08]Fames, thank you so much for those 10 community subs.
[33:19.98]Who else we have?
[33:22.08]Cherry Rowlet.
[33:24.18]Wow.
[33:24.92]Thank you for those 10 community subs.
[33:27.47]Shinomi.
[33:29.23]Thank you for those 10 community subs.
[33:32.91]Oh.
[33:35.13]Oh, that counts.
[33:38.20]I can't get up and spin the wheel.
[33:40.00]Let's do it.
[33:49.44]That's eight bugs.
[33:51.03]That's eight bugs, my favorite.
[33:53.69]Oh, I love bugs.
[33:56.31]Give me a few bugs.
[34:00.37]Did I get the mic right?
[34:02.15]Is the mic muted?
[34:05.71]Are we good?
[34:08.45]Oh, this is what I'm talking about, delicious bugs.
[34:15.91]That's unbelievably delicious.
[34:23.46]Again!
[34:23.80]You all ready?
[34:27.26]Oh, that's a random potion!
[34:39.46]The microphone is wet, apparently.
[34:44.63]Ah, what's in this one?
[34:45.57]This looks to be manna.
[34:49.97]Like it's underwater.
[34:53.72]Can you hear?
[34:56.02]It just sucks?
[34:57.50]Oh, well.
[35:16.45]I have to write somebody's name on my face?
[35:46.49]How am I gonna write that?
[35:48.95]That's impossible!
[35:51.47]Come here, Jake, please take this.
[35:53.89]Storms and shadows, you're gonna go right here.
[36:00.46]Let's see.
[36:02.98]Oh, jeez.
[36:04.28]It's gonna be quite difficult.
[36:08.48]I don't... Oh, that's an E.
[36:20.85]This is literally not possible.
[36:22.53]I need an S. What if the aliens find us one day?
[36:39.02]It's over.
[36:43.23]Wrong way.
[36:44.21]Snow them with what?
[36:50.76]Storms of... This is so hard, you have no idea.
[37:00.57]I'm drawing backwards.
[37:01.53]Storms of shadow.
[37:07.42]You get the idea, okay?
[37:14.22]I still have a bug in my mouth.
[37:25.94]I lost it, there it goes.
[37:33.84]I didn't even know who that was.
[37:45.38]I need to swallow this thing in my mouth, okay?
[37:49.18]Somebody said damaged?
[37:58.09]Swallowed.
[37:59.53]Just that simple.
[38:01.97]Oh, Shinoli.
[38:02.55]Did we get Shinoli already?
[38:05.69]Who did I not get?
[38:07.69]Oh, well, let's try.
[38:09.43]Thank you.
[38:11.19]Thank you.
[38:12.91]Thank you.
[38:14.25]Thank you.
[38:15.13]Has this 15?
[38:18.61]A feline.
[38:19.49]Feline defined.
[38:21.57]Thank you for your 10 community subs.
[38:23.31]Do I have to write that on my face?
[38:26.19]Oh, okay.
[38:28.85]Vertex, thank you.
[38:31.63]Clavicle, thank you.
[38:33.93]And hello, my name is blank, thank you.
[38:36.67]Let me try to move them.
[38:39.57]Do you want to come and adjust the microphone?
[38:41.55]Yeah, let me get a little better.
[38:43.89]What would your microphone adjust?
[38:46.82]That's my neck.
[38:47.78]Ow.
[38:47.84]I'm going to attach to your jowl here.
[38:53.36]Ow.
[38:55.54]OK.
[38:57.79]How does that sound?
[38:58.67]Is that better?
[38:59.19]I sound like Bane.
[39:02.43]What does that mean?
[39:03.17]I don't know who that is.
[39:07.11]You have skin?
[39:08.17]Your neck skin is peeling?
[39:12.08]Yeah, saved.
[39:13.12]Saved, okay.
[39:14.40]Thank you.
[39:16.02]We have some more to read.
[39:17.18]I need to spin the wheel a few more times.
[39:21.81]We did not anticipate this many people were going to actually do this.
[39:27.22]though we were not very well prepared.
[39:30.52]Century J Man, thank you, Century J Man, appreciate it.
[39:35.38]Master Mudkips, thank you.
[39:39.45]Oh, Chef Lazarus, thank you.
[39:43.13]And Real Anime Hours, thank you so much.
[39:47.93]So who do I need to put on my body?
[39:52.43]Where is that marker?
[39:55.15]Oh.
[40:00.21]Okay.
[40:02.03]Call me false.
[40:04.84]Call me false.
[40:08.98]Okay, there you are.
[40:10.16]Call me false.
[40:11.80]And then blind Irene.
[40:13.54]Oh, interesting.
[40:15.88]Blind Irene won.
[40:20.78]And then who?
[40:22.27]Ego.
[40:22.71]What's it again?
[40:23.49]Sorry, my hearing's not as good.
[40:25.75]Ego leech.
[40:26.85]Ego leech.
[40:27.73]Okay.
[40:30.27]Eco-leech.
[40:32.21]Oli-hex.
[40:33.75]Oli-hex.
[40:37.35]Oli-hex.
[40:39.81]Okay.
[40:42.51]Daddy big butt.
[40:43.43]Is this what people do?
[40:46.89]I'm running out of room.
[40:51.33]I'm running out of space already.
[40:54.07]Where do you put it?
[40:54.83]There we are.
[40:58.47]Fames, okay.
[41:01.23]And this is not coming off.
[41:02.41]This shirt's not coming off.
[41:04.13]Sorry about that, all of you.
[41:06.56]Sherry Rowlett.
[41:08.02]Fames.
[41:09.58]Sherry Rowlett.
[41:15.36]I'm gonna go on the other arm.
[41:18.90]Why not?
[41:19.38]What?
[41:21.42]What are people saying?
[41:22.28]Do it.
[41:22.64]I'm not going to do it.
[41:24.36]I'm not going to take this off.
[41:25.62]Are you out of your mind?
[41:26.66]Have you lost your mind?
[41:30.42]You already got the scene of the abominable snowman pretty much naked!
[41:34.66]That's not enough for you!
[41:35.78]What was it again?
[41:42.35]Real anime hours.
[41:44.91]Real.
[41:45.81]Anime.
[41:47.83]Hours.
[41:48.66]Well, I did my best.
[41:51.32]I just keep on... Alright, I can't do this anymore.
[41:57.04]What was that?
[41:57.92]Century J-Man.
[41:59.00]Century J-Man.
[42:03.21]This thing's running out of ink.
[42:06.63]Take a look, everybody.
[42:07.93]Those are your names on me.
[42:11.31]He removed the jorts.
[42:14.79]Okay.
[42:15.88]Alright, that was interesting.
[42:17.68]Century J-Man and all of you.
[42:21.03]I hope nobody heard that.
[42:22.53]I really hope nobody heard that, because that was awful.
[42:25.65]That was awful.
[42:26.83]It was absolutely horrible.
[42:28.01]Please tell me no one heard that noise.
[42:36.42]Nobody did.
[42:36.90]Alright, no more writing on body.
[42:40.28]I'll do right on face.
[42:41.50]I'm not writing on body anymore.
[42:43.35]You can't do this.
[42:44.81]I know about potions.
[42:45.97]I know how things work.
[42:47.07]I know if you do this too much, it could get you sick.
[42:51.26]It'll make you sick.
[42:52.86]I'm not doing it.
[42:56.00]What is this?
[42:57.64]Red Riolu.
[42:59.06]We did not anticipate this many.
[43:00.61]We thought we were going to spin the wheel three times.
[43:04.61]We didn't think we were going to spin the wheel more than like five times.
[43:08.55]Sedata.
[43:09.43]Thank you.
[43:10.75]Red Riolu.
[43:11.57]Thank you.
[43:12.73]What else we have here?
[43:14.17]Sculprit.
[43:16.45]Sculprit.
[43:17.39]What else we have?
[43:19.75]Forklifter, wow.
[43:21.87]Selling out.
[43:23.19]Is this what it is?
[43:25.46]Selling out.
[43:27.22]Selling out feels pretty good.
[43:30.68]E-Himbo.
[43:35.62]This is the one that I just grabbed.
[43:37.92]This is quite, quite the image, I would say.
[43:46.33]Quite the image, I would say.
[43:50.20]We got 100 subs?
[43:52.96]Oh, God.
[43:57.77]Okay, let's spin the wheel.
[44:00.93]It's very hard to keep track of and keep up with it.
[44:03.81]But we're going to try.
[44:04.61]Let's see if we can get something here.
[44:05.91]What's the question?
[44:18.75]Oh.
[44:20.62]You see, when we originally envisioned this stream, I thought maybe, maybe we would have people ask me questions.
[44:30.75]But when 2,000 people subscribe at the same time in 15 to 20 minutes, that becomes not possible anymore.
[44:39.89]I have a question.
[44:42.60]What's the question?
[44:43.60]Did you fart in the tub?
[44:44.80]Did I fart in the tub?
[44:53.62]Does that answer your question?
[45:08.03]Alright, I need to do things.
[45:09.21]50 more subs.
[45:10.47]What's the name?
[45:12.43]Freddy Dredd.
[45:12.93]Freddy Dredd, the musician.
[45:16.83]I'm just going to use this because it's easier.
[45:19.35]Oh, you have it right there.
[45:20.53]Freddy Dredd, the musician.
[45:24.96]Very talented young man.
[45:28.37]Oh boy, oh boy.
[45:29.49]You're going to have to go down somewhere on the neck area.
[45:35.99]Riding backwards and sideways, mirrored.
[45:41.11]It should be a special skill.
[45:42.78]It should be like at the Olympics.
[45:53.11]Oh, actually, that makes it a little easier.
[46:01.10]E. Oh, shit.
[46:05.24]Fuck.
[46:07.44]F-R-E.
[46:11.02]D. How do they do this?
[46:12.84]How do people do this?
[46:15.70]It's not possible to do this.
[46:17.57]It's impossible.
[46:18.33]It really is.
[46:21.27]Fred.
[46:24.38]Freddie Dredd.
[46:26.68]I like your last name, if that is your real name.
[46:31.26]E.F.
[46:31.66]Bugleberry is mine.
[46:32.90]It stands for Barry Fanard Bugleberry.
[46:36.64]You need room for the 170.
[46:39.49]I do, okay.
[46:42.13]Let's see.
[46:42.67]Freddie Dredd.
[46:50.75]Good.
[46:52.05]Very good.
[46:53.84]h f s k a h oh man h f s h f s k a k a h f h f h this is painful j d a
[47:23.59]I got scammed.
[47:25.61]I'm scamming?
[47:27.43]Oh, I'm the scammer.
[47:28.83]There's another 50 subs.
[47:33.14]Another 50 subs.
[47:33.52]Did you wait?
[47:34.02]What did you say?
[47:34.62]Did you just say that we had, that there was a phone call?
[47:37.70]Somebody was trying to call?
[47:38.96]Who's calling?
[47:42.72]You said 50 subs before that.
[47:43.84]You said that there was a phone call.
[47:47.38]Is that Jerma?
[47:47.98]Hey, what's up?
[47:52.74]Yes.
[47:52.84]Yes, I made the course I did.
[47:54.84]I can't just hang out.
[47:56.60]It's a cauldron.
[47:57.34]I'm not done.
[47:58.20]It's a cauldron.
[47:59.08]It's not a hot tub.
[47:59.86]It's a cauldron.
[48:14.61]He's just pissed because he's not getting the money.
[48:16.29]How much money did you make?
[48:17.03]That's right, yeah.
[48:17.99]Too much.
[48:18.89]I get some of that money.
[48:19.97]No, you don't.
[48:20.77]I get at least half of that money.
[48:23.58]No, he doesn't.
[48:25.28]Not at all.
[48:26.72]Hang up on him.
[48:27.64]Nothing to do with anything.
[48:28.72]Hang up on him.
[48:29.76]This is not what we agreed to.
[48:31.12]Hang up on him.
[48:32.14]Just get out.
[48:33.18]Thank you, everyone.
[48:34.14]Thank you, Bugleberry.
[48:35.16]It was really nice to see you again.
[48:36.72]Shut up.
[48:37.06]Now get out of the fucking house.
[48:38.38]Hang up on him.
[48:40.38]Did you hang up?
[48:43.92]Good.
[48:45.08]If he, when he calls back, don't answer again.
[48:47.86]He can come down here if he has a problem.
[48:50.72]Oh, making money.
[48:51.74]Oh, that's what it's about.
[48:53.04]He's annoyed that I'm making more money than he is.
[48:56.86]What a fucking joke.
[48:59.56]That was not a fart, I swear to God.
[49:01.62]That was not a fart.
[49:04.29]It looked like it, but it wasn't.
[49:05.83]It kind of did look like it.
[49:07.97]It sounded like it, too, if that picked up.
[49:13.20]Oh, what have we got here?
[49:14.04]More balls.
[49:14.58]Let's see them.
[49:17.12]Well, he could do this if he really wanted to.
[49:19.14]Why is it my problem?
[49:23.00]Is there a lot coming in?
[49:24.74]Oh, shit.
[49:30.49]I can't read these all.
[49:32.29]I cannot read these.
[49:35.11]Freddie Dredd gets a ball.
[49:36.65]He's on my face.
[49:38.95]Why does he get a ball?
[49:40.15]He has the whole real estate.
[49:46.94]Fanches, thank you.
[49:50.76]Ghostpoplive, thank you.
[49:55.56]Hey, Kip, thank you.
[49:57.26]Three more from the face.
[49:58.54]Oh, I think we have two mics on.
[50:05.52]Nosebuss, S-N-K-F-E-X, thank you.
[50:12.25]Let's spin the wheel.
[50:15.43]Are there two mics on?
[50:16.41]Not anymore.
[50:17.71]Oh.
[50:20.33]Let's spin it.
[50:24.39]Who's got a question?
[50:29.76]I'm not trying to scab, I promise.
[50:40.13]Aaron?
[50:41.25]What is that?
[50:41.75]What's Aaron?
[50:42.67]What's Aaron?
[50:44.03]What is that?
[50:44.45]What's Aaron?
[50:45.95]Why are they saying that?
[50:47.99]Oh, I think we lost one of our lights.
[50:50.97]I think one of our lights got screwed up.
[50:52.69]Here's a question for you.
[50:54.07]Why the fuck are we doing this?
[50:56.12]How's that one?
[51:03.18]What is your actual height?
[51:04.98]What is my height, Bugleberry?
[51:06.70]I'm six foot four.
[51:09.20]I'm not Jerma, you know.
[51:12.30]I'm up here, and he's not here.
[51:14.06]I'm not Jerma.
[51:17.06]Oh, these are the ones that go on the face?
[51:20.27]Holy smokes, hold on.
[51:23.59]What has happened?
[51:28.83]Question.
[51:29.31]How many more questions?
[51:32.09]Oh, how?
[51:33.01]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[51:35.15]Okay, so we have Vinsmore.
[51:39.19]Vins... Oh my god.
[51:44.92]Vinsmoke.
[51:48.92]Vinsmoke.
[51:54.29]Vinsmoke.
[51:55.41]Metal Zalor.
[51:56.53]Metal Zalor.
[51:58.21]What'd you say?
[51:58.89]Metal Zalor.
[52:02.09]Hold on.
[52:03.23]Metal Zalor.
[52:06.63]I tried.
[52:08.09]And then Goiki.
[52:09.05]Goiki, I'll put you up here.
[52:11.27]By the way, I just want to make this clear.
[52:14.01]I'll say it in a second.
[52:16.81]Goiki.
[52:18.87]Here you are.
[52:21.85]Goiki.
[52:24.09]Excellent work.
[52:25.49]It just looks like the original.
[52:26.93]It looks like old caveman paintings.
[52:29.75]This is Grug.
[52:30.97]My name's Grug.
[52:34.90]After paying...
[52:36.40]for production and paying for the people that are kind enough to be spending their time here.
[52:42.80]The remaining proceeds of this stream will be given to charity.
[52:45.50]I want to make that very clear.
[52:48.30]So, I'm going to be giving this to charity.
[52:50.83]I'm not going to be taking this.
[52:53.11]It's time for a dance party.
[52:54.21]It's time for a dance party?
[52:56.87]Oh!
[52:57.47]Dance party!
[52:59.97]Play the music!
[53:05.13]Hold on!
[53:07.91]What the hell is that?!
[53:22.20]Wait a minute, hold on, what's this?
[53:26.10]What is this?
[53:28.37]What the hell?
[53:33.41]Oh.
[53:34.88]Oh, oops.
[53:36.92]I don't know how that happened.
[53:40.91]Ah, man, that hurt.
[53:46.33]Shall we spin the wheel again?
[53:47.47]Okay.
[53:50.33]Is the water warm?
[53:51.87]Yeah, it is.
[53:53.20]It's perfect for me.
[53:54.24]Negative 15 degrees Celsius.
[53:58.60]That's nice and warm for me.
[54:01.92]Mmm.
[54:05.51]Stand up?
[54:06.53]Oh, no, no, no.
[54:08.67]I don't stand up.
[54:10.09]I will spin the wheel again and hopefully we land on something besides question.
[54:14.98]Maybe question should have been something we made small.
[54:17.40]That's my fault.
[54:19.44]I should not have made question big.
[54:21.82]Figured it would be easy.
[54:24.88]Let's go.
[54:28.76]That's foam!
[54:29.58]Time for a foam party!
[54:45.45]Whoa!
[54:48.17]Hold on, I gotta... Okay, okay.
[55:06.84]This looks really, really ridiculous.
[55:09.42]But that's 2,000 subs.
[55:13.48]I just rolled around for 20 minutes.
[55:16.52]Who is this?
[55:17.78]Gooberry Juice.
[55:19.20]Gooberry Juice.
[55:21.82]Well, I dropped the marker in the hot tub.
[55:24.74]Hopefully we can get that out with a little bit of elbow grease.
[55:28.95]Gooberry Juice.
[55:36.29]Gooberry Juice, OK.
[55:40.15]That was directly into the eye socket.
[55:41.89]Thank God, I'm already dead.
[55:44.05]I'm an undead demon.
[55:46.86]I can handle it.
[55:48.60]Gooberry, a boat.
[55:50.66]I think it's time to end the names on face.
[55:54.58]We're running out of room and I'm very wet.
[55:58.02]Gooberry, we'll get you right here.
[56:01.03]Goo.
[56:03.11]Oh my God.
[56:03.99]Gooberry.
[56:10.69]This looks like two musical notes.
[56:13.86]Gooberry juice.
[56:19.28]J-U-I-C-E.
[56:27.60]There you go, Gooberry juice.
[56:33.52]You don't understand, I'm very wet and this is wet too?
[56:37.82]This mask, what mask?
[56:41.12]This mask is gonna be, why are you saying that?
[56:45.01]You're talking about my skin.
[56:48.35]Weird, weird people on this community.
[56:52.89]I sweat my arse off making characters for you to enjoy.
[57:00.00]You know how much I get paid for it?
[57:02.88]40 bucks a character, 40 bucks.
[57:09.58]Oh, Gerber, don't do that hot tub stream.
[57:12.06]Don't do the hot tub thing.
[57:13.59]It's a cauldron, first of all, and I've got, what?
[57:19.19]I would rather give it to charity, is what I'm doing.
[57:25.09]It's Shinoli.
[57:26.89]I'll do Shinoli on the cheek.
[57:28.21]Or on the chin.
[57:31.67]Shinoli.
[57:38.12]Shinoli.
[57:40.86]Fix the S. What's the other one?
[57:45.32]Captain Nemo.
[57:49.83]Captain Nemo.
[58:02.10]I keep laughing really hard, but this looks like a three-year-old's bedroom wall that he would get in trouble over.
[58:11.35]This is just... You got into the crayons.
[58:18.06]Let's spin the wheel.
[58:28.00]Oh no, not again.
[58:37.14]Phil, Phil!
[58:38.38]Don't hit the eye again!
[58:40.02]How?
[58:40.80]How did that happen twice?
[58:42.90]Spray it in the tub!
[58:44.62]In the tub!
[58:45.62]In the tub!
[58:46.40]Inside!
[58:47.64]How did this happen twice?
[58:54.41]Okay.
[58:56.31]I might need a small towel.
[58:59.77]It happened twice.
[59:01.57]Thank you, community, Jake.
[59:10.01]Thank you.
[59:12.40]Oh, goodness gracious.
[59:15.78]Oh, can't wait to see the out-of-context Twitter tonight.
[59:22.46]Oh, boy.
[59:24.21]Just throw them in.
[59:25.37]Let's do another spin.
[59:30.79]Piñata time.
[59:32.25]It's time for the piñata.
[59:34.49]Alright, let's go.
[59:35.54]Where's the...
[59:41.06]Okay, here it comes!
[59:43.66]The piñata!
[59:44.54]Oh ho ho ho ho!
[59:46.98]Oh!
[59:47.44]Oops!
[59:47.92]Oh!
[59:48.48]Whoa!
[59:49.30]Oh, I got it!
[59:50.36]I got it!
[60:00.17]Alright, take it back!
[60:01.19]The piñata!
[60:01.95]I just broke his neck!
[60:03.47]That's all I did!
[60:05.93]He didn't have any candy in it!
[60:07.47]That was just awful!
[60:12.51]His neck just fell down.
[60:14.67]No, I don't want to.
[60:16.47]Get him out of frame.
[60:17.87]Get him out of frame.
[60:19.01]No, I don't want to.
[60:20.59]I don't want to.
[60:22.54]Look at him.
[60:23.16]He's so sad.
[60:25.28]Hold on.
[60:25.66]I'll fix him.
[60:27.18]I'll fix him.
[60:35.82]Take it away.
[60:37.79]Take it away.
[60:39.85]Spit it again.
[60:40.61]Why don't we?
[60:48.00]Another random potion.
[60:51.25]Interesting.
[60:56.31]Oh, what's this one?
[60:57.71]Yellow.
[61:04.13]Smells like eggs.
[61:05.48]Smells like eggs.
[61:14.46]Tastes like eggs too, but I like that.
[61:17.61]Oh, you know what I would do with this?
[61:19.07]I would drizzle this on top of a piece of toast, put an avocado on it.
[61:23.46]Oh, let me scrumptious.
[61:26.90]You can take that from me.
[61:29.10]You're probably noticing there's a small sliver here.
[61:37.64]I don't want to burp.
[61:39.10]Mute my microphone.
[61:40.42]Mute my microphone.
[61:46.25]Did you make that?
[61:46.75]Did you lie?
[61:48.41]Or did you actually mute it?
[61:50.71]Good.
[61:51.89]Good boy.
[61:55.32]So you're noticing there's a small sliver here.
[61:58.38]If that hits, it says apocalypse on it.
[62:02.06]Oh, and you know what that means?
[62:03.34]That means we are done here.
[62:05.32]Oh, look at that.
[62:06.88]Look at that nerd neck.
[62:09.08]I've heard that.
[62:09.72]Germans use that term before.
[62:14.16]Let's try.
[62:15.87]Get another one.
[62:21.93]Bugs again.
[62:25.15]Eat more bugs.
[62:29.19]Just give me one of the little ones.
[62:30.43]One of these little guys here.
[62:32.33]OK.
[62:38.10]Holy shit.
[62:38.64]These are good.
[62:44.42]I really actually.
[62:46.34]Hold on.
[62:46.70]Hold on.
[62:47.02]I'll get it.
[62:47.64]I'll get it.
[62:48.42]I'll fix it.
[62:48.92]Where is it?
[62:49.88]I'll fix it.
[62:53.07]There we go.
[62:57.96]These are very creamy.
[63:01.26]I would just throw them in.
[63:07.22]You're going to eat the bugs?
[63:09.58]You eat the bugs.
[63:11.14]You will eat the bugs.
[63:12.60]You will eat the bugs.
[63:13.72]What are you saying?
[63:15.91]What's worse?
[63:20.17]Turtle.
[63:22.91]It's a turtle.
[63:29.55]It's sold out.
[63:33.51]Oh no, everything is sold out.
[63:36.93]Oh no.
[63:42.01]It's all sold out?
[63:43.03]Why don't we spin the wheel one more time, huh?
[63:47.50]Again, everything's going to charity from my portion.
[63:50.10]I'm going to be paying the production staff handsomely.
[63:54.54]And then all of my portion from this stream is going to charity.
[63:59.34]I wonder what's going to happen if we spin the wheel again.
[64:01.90]What do you think is going to happen?
[64:07.54]I'm falling backwards.
[64:11.80]It's so dumb.
[64:16.10]Don't end the stream.
[64:17.64]Let's hang out for five more minutes.
[64:28.85]Let's see if I can read some of these names.
[64:31.29]That's X Sparta, 45.
[64:32.53]Oh my God, a human.
[64:37.90]Thank you.
[64:40.10]So what I want to do is I want to take a picture of this.
[64:42.40]I want to get them all out, take a photo of it.
[64:47.20]I'll retweet it out.
[64:47.96]That sounds fun to me.
[64:49.88]Maybe I'll do that in the next day or so.
[64:52.26]I'll ask Jerma if it's okay.
[64:54.89]PP slap.
[64:56.37]Thank you.
[64:59.09]Oh, tipped over.
[64:59.97]I think we got that one already.
[65:01.05]Somebody said, our stream Andy.
[65:08.67]Our stream Andy.
[65:10.09]Where's Andy?
[65:17.60]We did not anticipate this amount of things happening.
[65:22.14]We only had enough stuff, like 25 people.
[65:27.34]I don't know why we thought that that was going to work.
[65:32.13]Uh-oh, it's time to spin the wheel.
[65:45.09]What's it landing on?
[65:46.91]OH SHIT!
[65:47.67]IT LED TO AN APOCALYPSE!
[65:50.77]I'LL SEE YOU ALL SOON!
[65:51.87]DON'T WORRY!
[65:53.21]WE'LL GET OUT OF THIS TOGETHER!
[65:54.87]Thank you.
[65:55.47]Let me just be really clear before the world ends.
[65:58.81]This was a- this was a fun little joke, but I hope you enjoyed it.
[66:06.05]I appreciate you hanging out here, everybody.
[66:09.17]We'll get a nice photo of all the subs from today.
[66:21.52]Get this off camera right now.
[66:23.04]Get it off camera.
[66:23.74]That's like a... Did we miss anybody up here?
[66:29.08]He was rigged.
[66:45.06]Ocean dweller?
[66:46.96]Ocean dweller.
[66:47.70]Ocean dweller.
[66:48.34]Should we get him up here too?
[66:49.30]Let's get him up there.
[66:57.42]Want to get at least those ones?
[66:58.72]You said potion dweller?
[67:15.23]Potion dweller?
[67:16.95]And that's all the 50s?
[67:25.25]OK.
[67:33.93]All the people on the arms, I'll give you a special thanks very soon.
[67:38.43]I'll write it on my arm another day.
[67:39.93]I didn't anticipate this many people.
[67:44.74]Thank you, everybody.
[67:45.58]Have a great rest of your evening.
[67:49.92]We're out of here.
[67:50.56]Good night.
