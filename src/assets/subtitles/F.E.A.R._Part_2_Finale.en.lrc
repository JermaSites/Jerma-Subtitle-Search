[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.10]That was a little odd.
[00:03.24]For some reason, my Steam wouldn't connect.
[00:04.86]I had to force quit it and then open it again.
[00:09.40]Weird.
[00:10.98]Anyways, hello.
[00:14.42]Welcome back.
[00:21.62]I'm doing alright.
[00:24.34]I can't say I'm at 100% right now.
[00:27.74]Because that would be a lie.
[00:29.46]And you could go ahead and make a new one.
[00:30.70]Jerma lied about being at 100%.
[00:31.96]Because as the days progress here on this medication, I feel like it's probably going to get worse.
[00:44.49]As we go forward over the next another five or six days... Ugh.
[00:59.21]end of the life no I'm fine it's just I'm I'm alright I can't this is one of those things you just can't talk about on stream you just can't just know that like what the that's all you need to know
[01:23.21]But we're going to continue our fear playthrough from yesterday.
[01:28.05]I think we probably have an equal amount of time left.
[01:33.79]So I've been told there's probably about four hours, five hours maybe left in the game.
[01:37.42]We're just going to do it today.
[01:46.38]What happened?
[01:46.80]I missed it.
[01:47.22]Uh, I guess I'll just talk about... Alright, well, the nature of live broadcasting and the nature of Twitch and live stuff is people that were there yesterday may not be there tomorrow.
[02:03.43]And the people that weren't there yesterday may be here today.
[02:08.16]So, it's, um... That's... People wonder why... Well, you've already talked about this, like, three times.
[02:14.67]Well, it's because... You may not have been here two days ago.
[02:18.14]And if you were, maybe your friend right there... Sitting at the table... May not have been here yesterday, either.
[02:25.81]But, um...
[02:28.36]Yeah, I'm on a couple of new medicines.
[02:30.70]I'm having some stomach issues that, uh, I... we think are completely unrelated to, uh, colitis and stuff.
[02:41.57]So, I'm trying some new stuff, and what it does is it's causing me some discomfort.
[02:46.69]A discomfort, in quotes.
[02:51.05]And I have to do it for a while.
[02:52.39]So, the stream's over the next week or so, up until probably around Halloween.
[02:57.86]Are going to be shorter.
[02:59.74]But I'm going to do more streams.
[03:01.74]That's pretty much the way it's going to work.
[03:03.50]You're going to get less time on stream.
[03:05.66]But you're going to get more days streamed.
[03:09.44]There you go.
[03:10.44]Spread it around.
[03:11.06]Pass that around the lunchroom.
[03:15.32]I don't really even need an intro here.
[03:18.20]Because we already know what's going on.
[03:21.48]But I do need to tweet something.
[03:25.74]So let me do that real quick.
[03:31.46]Spread the word.
[03:34.69]Well, don't spread it too much.
[03:38.15]Because it's not going to be permanent.
[03:44.01]It's only going to be for like a week or two.
[03:47.65]Finishing Fear.
[03:48.73]I'm having a good time with this game, though.
[04:00.09]If you didn't catch the stream yesterday, this is a good one.
[04:07.39]And it really makes me want to play the other ones, even though I know that I'm going to be disappointed.
[04:12.73]But still, it's the same company, it's the same franchise.
[04:16.89]Could it really be worse by that much?
[04:21.30]2 is alright, 3 is the bad one.
[04:29.80]Fear 2 is alright.
[04:30.78]Fear 2 is fine.
[04:31.60]Okay, so Fear 3 is not the same company.
[04:33.94]Monolith didn't do Fear 3.
[04:35.76]Okay, alright, alright.
[04:41.09]Fear 2 is good.
[04:43.33]Alright.
[04:45.83]That's... I think I want to do them.
[04:49.15]Even if Fear 3 sucks, you don't think we should do the 3?
[04:51.59]We shouldn't do the trio?
[04:52.60]No.
[04:55.08]Will I hate that game to a point where there's a meltdown on stream and I quit the game halfway through?
[04:58.88]What do you think?
[05:01.27]Is it not worth doing?
[05:10.77]It may be.
[05:12.21]Never mind, you should play it.
[05:13.63]Alright, now we see where your... Now we see where your true intentions lie.
[05:22.32]Alright, let's go.
[05:22.78]Hi.
[05:25.28]Hi, it's me.
[05:27.94]So the last thing that happened... Let's break down the story here.
[05:32.39]Scary girl.
[05:34.15]Find this guy.
[05:36.31]Kill that guy.
[05:39.03]Cool.
[05:42.29]Pretty fun game.
[05:45.80]Pretty much.
[05:46.68]That's pretty much the plot of every horror game.
[05:50.74]Alright, I'm going in.
[05:51.36]I can't see anything you guys are saying now.
[05:55.03]Fear 3 isn't a bad game, it's just not a good fear game.
[05:57.51]It's worth playing if you like Fear 1.
[06:01.07]We'll see.
[06:02.87]I should probably at least do Fear 2.
[06:05.21]But there's... I got other stuff to do.
[06:07.88]There's a lot of games to play.
[06:10.82]Alright, I apparently saved it.
[06:13.62]Where was I?
[06:14.22]Okay, let me just check the audio levels.
[06:15.72]Boom, that's really, really loud for me, but it's probably alright for you.
[06:20.64]I can't tell.
[06:21.36]Is it really bad?
[06:22.36]Alright.
[06:23.26]Play the expansions to Fear 1.
[06:24.68]Alright.
[06:26.62]Maybe we'll do that too.
[06:30.54]Oh, I know why it's loud for me.
[06:32.62]Because I had to turn this up last night.
[06:37.98]Now it should be good for you.
[06:40.42]Check this out.
[06:41.12]Ready?
[06:43.55]That may have been too loud for you.
[06:48.39]Ow!
[06:51.52]I'm wasting ammo.
[06:57.30]Am I running?
[06:59.58]Why am I not... Wait, why am I going slow?
[07:01.50]Oh, it's because I'm crouching.
[07:04.36]Alright.
[07:06.88]How am I doing on health?
[07:07.60]Okay, I got... How many health packs do I have?
[07:12.14]The last thing I did... Alright, right, okay, I turned off the gas.
[07:18.11]From what I remember.
[07:18.71]And then I... Yep.
[07:20.99]No, I have to turn off the gas and then go up there.
[07:26.20]So the gas was over here.
[07:28.86]He didn't notice he was crouching.
[07:32.52]Yeah.
[07:33.64]I... Yeah.
[07:34.40]Okay.
[07:39.88]Alright, so this... I went down, but... No, this is where I came around...
[07:46.79]Didn't really pick the best place to stop Cuz I kind of it's like I'm turned around here Should have gotten the end of this section last night, but I just couldn't I couldn't do it Is this take place after I didn't I turn it off already did I pick the wrong save I May have picked the wrong save
[08:21.55]What a Chad.
[08:24.15]Really?
[08:33.28]I already got scared by this.
[08:34.50]Yeah, I picked the wrong save.
[08:38.00]It's the wrong save.
[08:39.54]And do you remember what I said yesterday?
[08:42.34]And I still feel the same way.
[08:43.97]That ended the stream last night.
[08:49.13]That hurt me again.
[08:50.63]That was the one.
[08:53.47]Why did I pick this save?
[08:54.69]No, I can't turn it off now.
[09:02.20]Alright, I'm fine.
[09:08.68]So that's turned off now.
[09:09.74]I'm gonna go up here.
[09:14.01]It hurt me.
[09:14.67]It did.
[09:20.60]Keep out.
[09:21.74]I don't think I will.
[09:26.22]What the fuck is in here?
[09:27.84]Health pack.
[09:28.84]Health upgrade.
[09:29.48]Alright.
[09:30.32]No, don't want to go down.
[09:34.58]Wait.
[09:34.84]Charge up the flashlight.
[09:42.17]This is... No, I need something with actual... What?
[09:44.61]There's no... I don't... No ammo in any of my guns.
[09:52.63]None of my weapons have ammo.
[09:55.65]Okay, so then now I can climb up the... There's this thing over here.
[10:01.58]I can go through there, or... Yeah, let's go through here.
[10:04.76]Because that's that.
[10:06.98]Alright, now I can go up the ladder.
[10:08.36]Oh, nice!
[10:11.60]Save it.
[10:16.95]Yeah, okay.
[10:17.69]This is where we stop.
[10:27.21]Yeah, I loaded the wrong save.
[10:28.37]That's my bad.
[10:28.89]That's on me.
[10:32.46]This is the wrong save.
[10:33.94]It's okay, though.
[10:34.54]Don't worry.
[10:34.86]Because this is where... I remember stopping here.
[10:41.34]Let's go up.
[10:51.03]I guess we're gonna go over here.
[10:53.87]Water?
[10:55.49]Is this a water valve or is this a steam valve?
[10:58.61]And I don't mean that.
[10:59.77]I really don't mean that as a reference to any video game companies.
[11:03.03]I actually mean like a steamer.
[11:15.27]I honestly did not mean that as like a... This is a funny valve joke.
[11:20.23]Like a company valve.
[11:21.07]What is going on over here?
[11:26.89]Okay, well the water's up.
[11:34.10]Am I killing somebody right now?
[11:41.75]Yes.
[11:43.91]Oh, that was a good joke, gay man.
[11:48.93]No, that's not what I was doing.
[11:55.15]Gay Ben.
[11:55.73]Remember when that was the funniest thing you could possibly say?
[12:00.17]It still might be.
[12:01.77]I don't know.
[12:04.27]Did I get everything in here?
[12:06.47]Wait, hold on.
[12:10.84]Okay, what year do you guys think had the best memes?
[12:17.56]Do you think it was like 2011, 2012, 2013?
[12:18.42]I think I'm missing something here.
[12:26.61]2012 started a lot of fucking weird stuff.
[12:31.03]Can I swim?
[12:33.65]Okay, I'm just gonna swim.
[12:39.13]2010 to 2015.
[12:39.27]I would even say probably... I'm not sure I would put... I don't know if I'd go as far as 2015.
[12:44.30]That's a little too far, I think.
[12:53.94]Turn it on?
[12:54.92]Turn it off.
[12:56.57]Oh shit, I just turned it on.
[12:59.57]What, like, shitty design that is.
[13:01.37]Down is not on, down is off.
[13:04.15]Up is on.
[13:05.23]Like a light switch.
[13:06.37]That's universal.
[13:07.03]That's like... That's driving on the right side of the road.
[13:09.75]In America.
[13:11.23]Or on the left side of the road in Europe.
[13:12.53]Like, come on.
[13:15.93]Up is on, down is off.
[13:22.20]Well, that did that.
[13:23.16]Now I just have to go back.
[13:25.69]They are hard to turn on.
[13:29.04]Oh, that's why.
[13:30.82]Because you need to, like, put weight down to turn it on.
[13:33.24]Alright, I just thought it was... Alright, whatever.
[13:35.22]You're right.
[13:38.18]Up is off, loser.
[13:38.94]Alright, here we go.
[13:46.45]Checkpoint.
[13:48.59]There's probably gonna be fucking monsters and shit here now, so I gotta be ready.
[13:59.43]I can now go through the door of the elevator.
[14:11.83]Somebody else?
[14:14.75]Who the fuck is here?
[14:24.50]What is happening to this guy's head?
[14:36.24]Save him.
[14:38.29]There is no saving that one.
[14:41.73]Okay, now I can go... Uh, wait.
[14:46.07]I can... Actually, I can use this, right?
[14:50.07]Where do I want to go?
[14:50.83]Two?
[14:51.31]One?
[14:52.60]Can I use... Oh, alright.
[14:58.18]Stop!
[14:59.65]okay just how do I alright they're gone while you were out of contact I gotta read a federal transmitter it's all the way on the other side of the research area from you you're gonna have to hustle to intercept okay intercept
[15:29.55]Uh, did the elevator... Did the elevator just open behind us?
[15:33.49]I don't know.
[15:34.05]I don't care.
[15:34.65]I... I just... You exploded?
[15:39.92]Wait, did he... What did he say?
[15:42.20]You exploded.
[15:44.90]Oh shit, you exploded!
[15:52.14]Oh no!
[15:53.12]Ugh.
[16:03.76]Oh, shit.
[16:06.95]This game is fucking so fun.
[16:09.37]Okay, here we go.
[16:10.47]Shotgun.
[16:10.97]I like the shotgun the best.
[16:14.23]Although... This thing sucks.
[16:18.56]It really does.
[16:19.44]It's just not very good.
[16:21.86]What the hell are you doing?
[16:24.12]Pick it up.
[16:26.13]What?
[16:27.27]Hey!
[16:31.59]Okay, 65.
[16:32.17]What do I have for heals?
[16:33.07]Might as well use one.
[16:36.53]I feel like I've been completely, just totally neglecting the pistols.
[16:40.23]I think I used it once in the first five minutes of the game.
[16:44.69]I feel kind of bad.
[16:45.43]You know what I mean?
[16:50.33]I feel like I want to... Is it just bad?
[16:52.38]There's a lot of ammo, and...
[16:57.37]Oh, that scared me.
[17:07.81]Alright, what's in here?
[17:09.47]Anybody in here?
[17:13.21]Okay, I don't know why my brain decided that this is what it was going to do, but I was going to hit control to see a hitman BOOM and look at points of interest.
[17:23.65]You know, it's the way that this looks.
[17:25.63]This room is a Hitman room.
[17:27.45]You know, does that make any sense to anybody?
[17:31.89]This is a Hitman room.
[17:36.90]It is.
[17:37.36]That's why I wanted to do it.
[17:38.36]It makes sense.
[17:44.82]Somebody's gonna be in here.
[17:48.82]No.
[17:49.34]Computer, computer...
[17:58.35]I was gonna close all of them, but... I decided that was not worth my time.
[18:03.33]Look out!
[18:03.69]It's high voltage!
[18:05.64]Should I... No.
[18:09.42]Okay.
[18:14.34]That's new music.
[18:21.03]Oh.
[18:22.75]It's the human Garfield.
[18:23.87]I forgot.
[18:24.39]Alright.
[18:29.92]I love how human Garfield has his own jokey, like, fairy tale music.
[18:33.86]Feed him.
[18:39.08]Should I feed him?
[18:41.00]Alright, let's feed him.
[19:12.13]Nobody move he usually eats him remember oops.
[19:18.38]Oh my god He's wearing a hat
[19:40.16]The whole building just went up.
[19:46.86]Okay.
[19:51.04]Well, that was fun.
[19:55.71]Override the security lockdown.
[19:59.21]You created a black hole.
[20:01.91]Somehow.
[20:02.59]Accidentally.
[20:03.17]Alright.
[20:03.59]I got my shotgun.
[20:05.84]Yes, I did think that was a person for a second.
[20:09.00]It's a horror game, come on.
[20:10.46]It's hard to not think the shadow is a monster.
[20:12.40]Imagine getting hit right in the face by an absolutely more than 8 to 10 pound weight.
[20:22.69]And just going like this.
[20:26.24]Without even flinching.
[20:36.21]What a true Chad.
[20:40.70]No, guys.
[20:41.82]No.
[20:53.37]What's in there?
[20:54.15]Wait.
[21:25.92]I fucked up his toaster.
[21:27.50]Sorry.
[21:30.86]What?
[21:31.18]Somebody opened the door?
[21:36.28]No, that's a waste of a grenade.
[21:37.98]Come back.
[21:49.46]Save scum.
[21:52.02]Yeah.
[22:41.53]Hmm, let's try and see if it could contain the blast.
[22:53.68]Okay.
[22:59.87]We already heard it.
[23:08.40]So where is this security room then?
[23:12.08]Through here?
[23:18.40]Somebody's gonna pop- That guy getting eaten in one of these, he's gonna come- Somebody's gonna fall out of one of these.
[23:24.55]A monster or something, a new enemy type.
[23:27.05]It's just completely and totally absolute.
[23:32.51]Oh shit.
[23:40.30]Good work That guy was very unsure
[24:12.73]What?
[24:13.71]Wait, what is going on?
[24:17.97]Hold on.
[24:19.03]So I threw... I frisbeed in to the room.
[24:24.22]They couldn't see me.
[24:25.08]I... They didn't know where I was.
[24:36.06]Quick.
[24:41.21]Shit!
[24:58.30]Alright, I need a
[25:31.96]Where is he?
[25:51.36]Stop.
[25:51.64]Talk.
[25:52.18]Sit.
[25:52.98]All clear.
[25:55.34]Where was he?
[25:55.70]I don't even hear it.
[26:00.14]I want to stick this on one of his butt cheeks.
[26:03.92]It's so important.
[26:12.96]The music is... What?
[26:23.16]Okay.
[26:24.94]Uh...
[26:30.21]Alright, I got him.
[26:32.33]Was he?
[26:32.55]Oh, that's cool.
[26:38.43]Alright.
[26:39.07]Who cares?
[26:48.54]I had to reload the fucking gun.
[26:59.96]That thing actually is not very good.
[27:03.56]It's not very good.
[27:04.98]You have to shoot him like three times in the head.
[27:07.31]Just only use the shotgun.
[27:08.63]It's the best weapon in the whole game.
[27:25.24]This guy...
[27:34.75]Was that guy shooting at him?
[27:36.78]I think he was shooting at him.
[27:39.30]I have no idea.
[27:43.94]That guy was on my team.
[27:53.12]He could have been.
[28:02.39]I'm stuck.
[28:06.13]How did they not see me that whole time?
[28:16.75]He's trying to flank.
[28:19.03]He's running straight at me.
[28:20.48]He's flanking us!
[28:21.52]Oh shit!
[28:27.44]I'm never gonna be able to hear them say that and not laugh at it.
[28:32.94]Oh shit!
[28:34.60]What I'm looking for is, I'm looking for three people in the same room.
[28:37.64]Four people.
[28:38.46]And it's- Oh shit!
[28:39.92]Oh shit!
[28:41.16]Oh shit!
[28:42.57]I wanna hear it four times in a row.
[28:44.97]That's the only thing I want.
[28:46.39]What the fuck is that?
[28:53.24]There's a rocket launcher?
[28:58.35]I want to have five people in a room, rocket launch, explode, oh shit, explode, oh shit.
[29:04.59]I want the pitch to keep going down.
[29:07.43]That'll be the ultimate video game laugh out loud moment for me.
[29:14.31]Alright, let's go.
[29:16.43]Save it.
[29:22.68]We got two in a row.
[29:24.64]Can we get like four in a row?
[29:28.90]Oh, uh, it's gonna take just dice thrown in the air.
[29:32.48]It's gonna- What?!
[29:41.08]It's- You shoot three?!
[29:54.45]Okay, this is too good to use right now.
[30:06.44]It's just, it's, I don't want to use this.
[30:08.20]It's too good.
[30:15.42]I wasted it.
[30:17.89]I know.
[30:18.67]That's alright, though.
[30:21.01]I'll get more ammo for it, and I will only use it.
[30:24.01]I thought it was a one-shot, that's why.
[30:25.33]Still helping?
[30:35.13]What the fuck?
[30:38.59]Hello?
[30:38.93]Oh, dude.
[30:41.85]You're down there.
[30:42.72]No, no, no.
[31:05.23]Oh, shit.
[31:05.71]Nice throw.
[31:06.45]Oh, shit.
[31:15.59]Why are you holding the gun like that?
[31:31.08]Okay.
[31:38.01]I guess I'll take it.
[31:45.03]I know I can get in there?
[31:45.85]I'll get out this way.
[31:50.79]Security room?
[31:52.41]Here we go!
[32:02.27]He performed final acrobatics before he died.
[32:08.07]Yes, I'm still on hard.
[32:09.03]Okay, here we go.
[32:09.53]Who's coming in?
[32:10.57]Why would you have the monitor here?
[32:13.22]It's going to be a scary thing that runs by.
[32:37.82]Apparently not.
[32:39.35]Alright, everything has been activated.
[32:41.35]Now we have to go back.
[32:45.11]I can leave through here.
[32:48.61]Alright, it's done.
[32:54.75]Nope.
[32:55.43]That is not gonna fucking happen.
[32:56.91]14, 35, 43.
[33:26.28]Damn it!
[33:46.57]It's gotta be the detonate one.
[33:56.84]No, I have to do this once Didn't I Didn't even get it in You motherfucker I swear to God I
[34:27.83]There, it's in.
[34:30.85]Oh well.
[34:46.98]Nooo!
[34:59.78]Quick, run around to every floor and hit- quick!
[35:02.44]Sprint up!
[35:04.40]Press every button on every floor on the way down, running down the stairs.
[35:07.36]That'll fuck him.
[35:15.09]Why do I keep trusting that guy?
[35:22.29]That guy just disappears.
[35:24.47]He doesn't do anything else, he just runs away.
[35:28.19]Alright, I was already in here.
[35:29.23]This is the way to go to where I just was, so... Didn't another door open?
[35:39.34]I'm certain that another door opened.
[35:42.46]And then he turned off.
[35:44.76]That's so annoying.
[35:49.16]Can I even go over here?
[35:51.65]Oh shit!
[35:54.47]Do I have to meet him upstairs?
[36:02.88]Oh, God damn it, I do.
[36:04.16]Hold on.
[36:12.93]This... Come on, there's not a health upgrade here.
[36:17.27]Why would you have this here if there wasn't an upgrade?
[36:20.65]That's total bullshit.
[36:24.64]What just happened?
[36:25.18]There's no cool music right now?
[36:30.80]I know, what the fuck?
[36:47.35]This is, uh, great.
[36:48.53]Just seeing what happened.
[37:01.35]Alright, we made it.
[37:07.77]Game is saved.
[37:09.21]What's next?
[37:15.56]Sayonara, sucker.
[37:24.20]It's very, very quiet.
[37:25.22]That means something's going to jump out.
[37:30.04]That's audio editing 101.
[37:36.07]Make the audience have to focus on the fact that there's no audio.
[37:40.61]Go, wait, why is there no audio?
[37:42.13]Then loud noise.
[37:49.55]This doesn't open?
[37:51.79]This looks like it's on.
[38:02.54]Oh, perfect.
[38:04.02]You again.
[38:04.88]See this button?
[38:07.38]I wonder what this does.
[38:09.59]Bye-bye now.
[38:15.66]You almost didn't fit through the door!
[38:16.98]You almost didn't fit through the door!
[38:18.64]I get the last lap!
[38:30.90]Okay.
[38:32.90]Can I destroy it?
[38:38.70]Let's just hide.
[38:59.52]Why is that in here?
[39:00.54]Why does that exist?
[39:04.58]Yo, you left your cactus.
[39:07.98]I don't think he cares.
[39:09.24]Alright, so let's go in here.
[39:14.28]No?
[39:14.92]No?
[39:18.49]Jesus.
[39:27.39]So I can't go this way now.
[39:29.05]There's no... Make sure I don't miss this, like, no... What the fuck's happening?
[39:32.11]Okay.
[39:33.99]Go back.
[39:34.33]Okay, well.
[39:49.34]It's a retro stream.
[39:50.68]Uh-oh.
[39:59.55]Why is my bitrate so low right now?
[40:03.83]These graphics suck.
[40:10.00]Why is this happening?
[40:13.26]Oh, I think I have a setting.
[40:15.40]I think there's a new setting on OBS now.
[40:18.94]Where if your internet sucks, it doesn't drop frames, it drops your bitrate.
[40:31.55]I wonder, that's interesting.
[40:37.12]It's 2007 all over again.
[40:42.86]That's better?
[40:43.40]Yeah, it was like a pretty revolutionary thing that they were working on.
[40:47.84]I remember I talked to somebody at TwitchCon about it.
[40:52.34]But the real question is, how long?
[40:54.28]I wonder, do we just kind of slowly come back?
[41:00.24]Let me just do one thing.
[41:01.14]Let me just look at this real quick.
[41:02.17]I want to see if this is actually... If that's what's actually happening.
[41:06.01]I saved it.
[41:06.43]Hold on.
[41:07.73]Let me just check something.
[41:12.58]That's very, very cool.
[41:18.04]Let me just see if that's what it's doing.
[41:22.71]Maybe...
[41:30.11]Because this is happening in like real time.
[41:43.42]This is so strange.
[41:47.44]I didn't think this was on any of the other OBSs though.
[41:55.10]Because I don't think this is enabled.
[42:00.27]What's this link you guys are spamming?
[42:02.91]Wait, that's what this looked like.
[42:07.43]Oh my god.
[42:08.41]That looked like I made it out of clay.
[42:16.62]I think that is what's happening though.
[42:20.40]You know, I'm just going to say that's what's happening.
[42:22.70]And we're just going to go back to playing the game.
[42:24.73]Because it looks like it's climbing back to like 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 now.
[42:30.09]Interesting.
[42:35.13]What did it hit?
[42:42.82]Dude, that is an amazing feature that they came up with, though.
[42:45.34]That's insanely awesome.
[42:48.59]Because your stream won't turn the fuck off anymore.
[42:59.10]That's so awesome.
[43:02.82]Thank God for smart people making smart things in technology.
[43:07.10]Alright.
[43:07.92]This is actually the bitrate that I used to stream at.
[43:10.92]I used to stream at this exact bitrate.
[43:13.06]At like 4800.
[43:13.50]So this is actually twitch.tv/Jerma985 from like 2016.
[43:15.46]2015.
[43:15.54]Can I activate it?
[43:28.21]Why can I not turn that on?
[43:31.03]Warning, video cameras are operating on these premises.
[43:33.77]Good.
[43:34.01]What?
[43:34.91]How could you tell?
[43:36.92]Alright, I'm going for... This is what these are for.
[43:39.40]Hmm.
[44:01.89]Excuse me?
[44:03.29]Excuse me?
[44:03.99]I... Huh?
[44:10.46]What?
[44:22.03]Never mind, those things suck.
[44:24.61]I can't even see where this thing is now.
[44:26.41]Where did it blow up?
[44:39.76]That was... That was... I can't... I can't save scum.
[44:44.50]Just go.
[44:46.56]That was too many health packs.
[44:55.91]Okay, so... See, what we do here on Jerma985 is we make sure that we show everybody our best and our worst.
[45:03.94]This is the Mario Tennis stream.
[45:06.83]Alright, we started out alright, and then I started, like, swearing at people and making fun of people on Mario Tennis, and everybody really hated it, and it went right down.
[45:13.72]But I want to make sure everybody knows that we don't do that shit.
[45:17.02]We show the worst that we have, but we also show the fucking big recoveries that we have, too.
[45:23.08]This is from the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 stream, where I was playing really poorly, and everybody was, like, making fun of me, and everyone made fun of me, and then I pulled off a one million point trick and made a ton of great jokes in a row.
[45:34.54]You can always salvage it.
[45:35.80]Don't throw it away.
[45:40.10]And then this one is... That one's Tesla.
[45:43.90]I just always want to keep track of it because I trade it.
[45:55.79]Okay, so... No, I'm not doing any chin faces anymore because I know how bad I look.
[46:18.55]I'm doing Kermit the Frog.
[46:35.72]Why won't these explode?
[46:48.85]Throw them next to it.
[46:50.07]Well, what?
[46:50.97]It shouldn't explode.
[46:52.48]I need more health now.
[47:09.14]I have a quicksave to about five minutes.
[47:10.76]I'm supposed to make a macro for that.
[47:13.30]I'm supposed to make a macro for every time I throw a grenade, it saves the game.
[47:20.11]Okay, uh, let's go that way.
[47:28.40]Right.
[47:28.72]Electricity.
[47:30.24]Off.
[47:30.84]There we go.
[47:32.02]Oh no, I don't like that.
[47:34.48]No more turrets.
[47:37.28]That's a good thing.
[47:44.70]Does that let me open the doors now?
[47:52.05]Okay, I think like three hours have gone by.
[47:54.53]In-game.
[47:59.19]No, none of these open.
[48:01.03]That just turned off the turrets.
[48:04.53]That's it.
[48:04.98]Didn't do anything else.
[48:07.82]That's that.
[48:08.54]Nothing up here.
[48:09.50]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[48:14.96]Maybe now I can keep going?
[48:17.02]Further through... What's this way?
[48:20.46]Could go that way.
[48:21.06]Yeah, I'll go up.
[48:23.44]We're down.
[48:23.76]No, I'll go down.
[48:25.12]I haven't been over here yet.
[48:32.83]Health upgrade?
[48:35.41]No?
[48:38.59]Jerm is so smart, he can see time.
[48:43.53]Um, I can't see time.
[48:45.63]I can see the system that we have created as humans to be aware of its passing.
[48:53.60]There's a difference.
[48:55.34]I turned it off!
[48:56.10]I turned it off!
[49:03.58]Am I missing?
[49:04.56]Oh god, I'm in trouble.
[49:07.29]I'm just miss- Did I get it?
[49:16.25]Oh my god.
[49:19.90]I thought I turned this shit off.
[49:22.18]Just throw a grenade.
[49:23.85]What do you mean just throw a grenade?
[49:25.03]The last two times I've thrown a grenade into it, they've magically disappeared.
[49:29.87]A regular grenade would bounce off of it and come back and kill me.
[49:34.76]I can't use the rockets because I might need it for something.
[49:40.36]Like this.
[49:42.50]Like this scenario.
[49:44.87]This is the scenario.
[49:46.49]To-
[49:56.28]Is this what hackers do?
[49:58.24]Is this like pulling up to a red light next to a guy in a Lamborghini?
[50:03.03]Is it like... Alright.
[50:07.27]You ready?
[50:07.73]Let's go.
[50:08.59]Fine.
[50:16.12]What's he doing?
[50:17.86]Is he in yet?
[50:26.59]I hope I can just push this guy off, like, the edge.
[50:30.41]You know what I mean?
[50:30.89]I don't want to, like, kill this guy.
[50:33.41]I just want to push him over, like, a cliff.
[50:34.91]That would kill him, probably.
[50:41.79]Maybe.
[50:45.03]I can't activate that, so let's just go.
[50:48.45]Wait.
[50:49.21]One, two, secrets.
[50:56.50]Trevor, that kills people.
[50:59.00]Well, it depends.
[50:59.56]I don't know.
[51:01.42]There's a difference.
[51:03.28]Guys, pushing somebody over an edge off a cliff could mean, like, on the top of a playground slide.
[51:10.88]Or, like, Grand Canyon.
[51:12.82]You know what I mean?
[51:13.60]It's off the edge.
[51:15.10]I just want to push them off a slide.
[51:16.28]That's what I meant.
[51:23.96]That's a slide, not a cliff.
[51:28.14]We could argue semantics here.
[51:30.53]What is a cliff?
[51:31.45]What could it be?
[51:32.33]What is an edge?
[51:33.21]What does pushing somebody off an edge mean?
[51:36.03]A cliff is not a man-made... Why is he running around?
[51:48.86]I don't understand what this guy's game is.
[51:51.08]There's people... There's like a whole agency of weird super soldiers that are killing us and trying to kill everybody.
[51:58.99]And there's all this awful shit going on.
[52:02.11]There's a little scary girl.
[52:04.09]And... Why is he running away from me?
[52:10.08]Okay.
[52:12.26]Let me ask a question.
[52:12.96]It's been like six hours in the game.
[52:14.66]Can you cook grenades?
[52:21.59]Yes.
[52:23.07]No.
[52:25.79]We're about to find out.
[52:38.42]You cannot.
[52:39.80]Otherwise this would have exploded.
[52:51.67]So we're just gonna have to use this thing.
[52:53.99]Here we go.
[53:05.58]It's still there.
[53:06.16]Is it gone?
[53:13.44]Oh my god, it needs six rockets?
[53:20.27]Well, that's unfortunate.
[53:21.43]I can't open this.
[53:31.69]No?
[53:32.51]No Easter egg to give to a soda?
[53:40.22]I get to push him over an edge.
[53:41.90]I get to push him down a cliff.
[53:43.80]I get to do that.
[53:45.61]I am gonna... He's gonna say his last line, and I'm gonna push him down the laundry chute.
[53:50.13]I get to do what I've wanted.
[53:51.03]I... I get to do it.
[53:53.77]I can't wait.
[54:09.22]Oh, come on!
[54:16.07]He made it in.
[54:19.49]Wonderful.
[54:20.65]Good.
[54:20.79]I think I don't get to do my fun thing that I wanted to do so bad.
[54:28.80]That's very disappointing.
[54:37.78]Alright, let's take a look over here at anything that's over here that I need to do.
[54:42.58]Oh, shit.
[54:43.62]Just, hold on.
[54:49.18]Yeah, he's stuck in that vent.
[54:51.06]Just fill that thing with chocolate syrup and you got the first half of the Willy Wonka movie.
[54:55.48]Alright, that's good.
[55:21.97]Wait, why are these here?
[55:38.36]What the fuck was that?
[55:44.14]OK.
[56:17.85]Alright, that's gone.
[56:27.13]I think I'm by it by this point.
[56:37.45]How are you still aiming down here?
[56:39.03]What?
[56:39.13]Oh, that's a crock of shit.
[56:49.45]no here comes a Jupiter storm watch out left or right uh let's go right first right looked shorter good call uh oh um is it one of those things
[57:31.31]You love cocaine.
[57:34.10]I would advise on not doing that anymore.
[57:39.72]It's not very good for you.
[57:40.95]I would not do that anymore.
[57:47.33]Clip that, yeah.
[57:52.92]I would advise on not doing anything like that.
[57:56.18]It's not good for you.
[57:57.54]It's not good for you.
[57:59.42]Eat a fucking banana, okay?
[58:01.32]Eat a banana.
[58:17.39]What?
[58:20.71]What?
[58:21.01]Did he just jump out of the ceiling?
[58:32.53]He did.
[58:34.99]Roger.
[58:35.75]Oh no, that was Roger.
[58:36.71]That was one of his friends.
[59:01.31]I have one bullet left in this thing.
[59:03.40]I need a new gun!
[59:10.42]I'm in trouble here.
[59:17.43]What?
[59:20.89]Alright, I have one health pack left.
[59:34.22]There we go.
[59:35.79]Good.
[59:37.49]Any other ammo or anything?
[59:38.81]I need a new gun.
[59:44.95]Hello?
[59:46.03]Ooh, perfect.
[59:49.64]A boost to my reaction speed thing.
[59:56.26]Turn the flashlight off.
[59:56.96]There's probably more.
[60:14.15]Was he destroying one of those turrets?
[60:20.33]Got him!
[60:50.94]Anymore?
[60:54.18]Kill that light.
[60:54.88]Alright, I have to replace the... I gotta replace the... No, this thing.
[61:01.49]Replace this.
[61:02.41]I don't... The nail gun isn't really that good.
[61:05.91]It takes too much.
[61:06.67]Even if you headshot, it takes like three headshots sometimes.
[61:09.83]That's too much.
[61:11.47]It should be two or one.
[61:23.70]Okay.
[61:26.26]So this is now... I can use this?
[61:28.30]Not yet.
[61:28.99]I will be using it though to go up or down.
[61:45.97]Wait a minute!
[61:46.53]He can shoot through the glass!
[61:55.08]Okay, give me some weapons here.
[61:56.74]This thing doesn't come into this room, right?
[62:07.45]Where is he?
[62:20.46]Holy...
[63:06.08]Come on, get in here.
[63:06.96]I can pick him up.
[63:10.24]I can pick him up.
[63:10.72]I can pick him up.
[63:17.32]Here's the plan.
[63:19.33]You ready for the plan?
[63:25.50]Okay, pull him over here.
[63:26.80]Put a gigantic trap for him.
[63:30.04]I'm going to pull him into this room.
[63:32.32]He's going to be all the way back here.
[63:34.64]Get this out.
[63:35.76]A gigantic trap.
[63:36.84]This guy is fucking dead.
[63:39.60]There he is.
[63:40.28]Okay.
[63:41.22]How are you?
[63:41.80]Good to see you.
[63:43.58]Now you're dead.
[63:53.30]See you in hell.
[64:20.76]Then why is the music still going?
[64:42.58]Alright, I guess I'm out of here.
[64:45.98]Wasn't even hard.
[64:48.30]It just took all of my stuff.
[64:50.98]Wait, there's ammo.
[64:54.58]I mean, I'm going, this is the last, the final boss is up here.
[64:56.78]That's where I'm going.
[65:06.96]That's a specific noise.
[65:09.14]That little, like...
[65:12.21]What is that from?
[65:24.80]I don't know.
[65:25.46]It's... Oh, it's gonna kill me.
[65:27.36]Is it from Mario 64?
[65:32.78]No, it's not.
[65:33.22]Is it real?
[65:44.82]Okay.
[65:46.02]Good, I have 100 now.
[65:48.50]100 armor.
[65:49.64]Save it.
[66:02.39]What's in here?
[66:02.93]Another one of those things?
[66:03.69]You're probably gonna have to fight, like, a few of them.
[66:07.83]Wait.
[66:09.94]Alright, I haven't been in here yet.
[66:11.94]Right?
[66:12.14]Okay.
[66:18.80]There it is.
[66:19.82]No.
[66:26.99]Why did I not break that?
[66:28.13]I should have fucking known.
[66:30.64]Really?
[66:30.90]That's the point.
[66:33.68]That's why I'm doing this.
[66:35.34]See?
[66:35.54]Because I know that I was there.
[66:48.34]Alright, what we got?
[66:50.50]Ladder.
[66:50.94]Let's go.
[66:53.83]Government, the game is too scary.
[66:54.81]Please change it.
[66:56.57]Nah, this is... Nah, it's not... It's not that bad.
[66:59.79]It's scary, but... Nah.
[67:13.40]Ready?
[67:13.62]It's gonna go...
[67:18.07]Do it.
[67:19.83]Do it!
[67:23.11]Come on, I'm really off with these predictions today.
[67:26.33]Come on.
[67:29.31]Amnesia is better than this?
[67:31.72]Well, I mean, this is not, oh my god, this is not supposed to... Okay.
[67:37.38]This is like a shooter game, though.
[67:43.60]I mean, it's, hey, you don't, you can't talk smack about fear.
[67:50.19]This is, like, a really cool game.
[67:51.65]I really like this game.
[67:54.61]And it's, like, scary.
[67:55.75]Man, but this is... This is old.
[67:58.01]It's not, like, brand new.
[68:11.16]C, Omega LOL, Omega LOL L. Cool.
[68:18.27]I actually really like this game.
[68:19.89]I think it's really good.
[68:20.94]I think it still holds up.
[68:23.64]This many years later.
[68:25.46]Is it toxic gas in here too?
[68:35.64]Why would you have a button to press that does that?
[68:37.42]That's Bill.
[68:52.56]I'm concerned about my findings since that effluent comes from residential areas.
[68:57.65]It may be originating in Auburn.
[69:00.05]I'm going to send you a copy of my report so you can make sure the proper people are informed.
[69:05.82]Next message from Ian.
[69:07.98]Hi, it's Janice.
[69:10.76]Yeah, it's Ian.
[69:11.42]I wanted to give you a heads up that you might be getting a call from Bill Moore.
[69:17.59]You might be getting a call from Bill.
[69:19.09]He's a fucking asshole.
[69:20.17]I think all he really wants is to believe that someone in authority has taken the ball and running with it.
[69:27.16]I fucked up by blowing him off, so I'm guessing he'll run to you.
[69:30.70]Anyway, look, let me know how it works out.
[69:36.38]That's a serious question.
[69:41.29]When was the last time you left or listened to a voicemail?
[69:44.73]When was the last time you left a voicemail?
[69:53.58]It's been a while.
[69:57.62]I think... Everybody knows that nobody checks their voicemails, so nobody leaves voicemails.
[70:04.59]Every time I get to a point where I really need to tell somebody something, I gotta talk to this person.
[70:11.41]By the time I leave a voicemail for you, if you're not available right now, I'm just gonna text you and you'll see that first, before you'll listen to a voicemail.
[70:21.67]Voicemail is really just... I don't have a reason to do it.
[70:27.78]I think, like, maybe if you, like, call the doctor or something to, like, leave.
[70:31.00]But even still, you just call again.
[70:33.42]You call, like, at 8 a.m.
[70:35.12]the next morning, and y'all, you get through to somebody.
[70:41.87]I don't really leave them anymore.
[70:45.95]And I don't listen to them either.
[70:52.14]Somebody could literally leave me a voicemail that says, Mr. Elbertson, this is Free Money Giveaway Incorporated.
[71:02.71]We have a check with your name on it.
[71:04.77]Literally, this is no questions asked.
[71:06.41]You get a million dollars if you just call me back.
[71:09.97]That's it.
[71:11.13]It's just a full taxed one lump set payment.
[71:14.56]And there's three doctors and two scientists in the room to make sure it's legit and a police officer and a tax attorney.
[71:20.38]Please call me back within seven days and you'll get it.
[71:22.60]And I wouldn't get it.
[71:29.44]I would get that voicemail, if that voicemail was left like yesterday, I would listen to that voicemail in July of 2020.
[71:38.23]When I go through and delete every voicemail that's saved in my iPhone.
[71:50.97]Check now, what if it's there?
[71:52.35]Well, it's too late anyways if it's there.
[71:55.58]No, it's too late anyways.
[72:00.39]Check now.
[72:01.21]No, I definitely don't have one.
[72:04.26]See, now, a great joke for this stream, if I had thought about that beforehand, was to have a voicemail on my phone of that what I just told you.
[72:13.18]And it's like, at the end, it says, End of message.
[72:16.24]Received on May 12th, 2018.
[72:18.84]Oh, well.
[72:30.67]Alright, let me make sure I got everything that I need here.
[72:33.07]I have full everything.
[72:34.08]I don't think there's anything else in here, so I'm going to go the way that I'm supposed to go, this way.
[72:52.29]And here, this would be an even funnier thing to do.
[72:54.81]Is have that voicemail, a different version of it, like six or seven different times.
[72:59.33]Over the course of like a full year.
[73:05.49]Like, I had a really good chance.
[73:09.19]Stop.
[73:09.89]Stop.
[73:10.39]What?
[73:12.91]Missed lore.
[73:17.05]There's a scary girl and you're in the facility.
[73:20.14]There.
[73:22.36]Pitch that around.
[73:30.70]Look, I won't miss this.
[73:33.86]Nothing even in there.
[73:34.88]I don't want that.
[73:36.82]Is this where the... Here we go.
[73:39.58]Where are they?
[73:42.32]Wait, am I gonna... I'm not gonna, like, poison them, am I?
[73:46.84]Oh, I...
[74:01.43]Do they know where it is?
[74:11.89]Who are these people?
[74:15.23]It's a turret.
[74:16.09]Don't come in the room with the turret.
[74:23.17]Why would you go in the room with the turret?
[74:28.88]Oh shoot, it's a turret in there!
[74:31.68]Everybody go in!
[74:32.78]Everybody run in at the same time.
[74:50.95]No you won't.
[75:12.76]Who?
[75:13.10]Where?
[75:24.64]It's a turret!
[75:26.28]There's a turret in there.
[75:28.79]What's with the cactus?
[75:31.77]I feel like this is a cactus theme in this game.
[75:37.65]Okay, what about down here?
[75:44.06]What?
[75:44.95]Alright, but who is this?
[76:12.66]Did somebody fall off?
[76:15.06]And they're just like, oh, oh well, resume patrol.
[76:19.44]These guys aren't on the same team.
[76:21.70]Okay, that's good to know.
[76:24.67]Any secrets?
[76:31.15]What the hell is the ATC doing?
[76:41.57]Okay, let's sneak around up here.
[76:42.89]A lot of ammo going to be up there, definitely.
[76:44.59]Put out the shotgun again.
[76:45.55]It's the best weapon.
[76:47.65]You heard my gun?
[76:49.63]You didn't just hear my gun, did you?
[77:01.08]Okay.
[77:06.84]Look at how many people are up here.
[77:08.24]This is ridiculous.
[77:11.70]find him.
[77:12.28]Well, you did.
[77:15.02]You found me.
[77:18.54]Lot of blood.
[77:19.62]Lot of blood here.
[77:21.72]Lot of blood.
[77:30.99]Mist lore.
[77:31.69]Mist lore.
[77:37.27]What do I got?
[77:37.69]Five?
[77:48.29]Nothing else over here?
[77:51.64]Is that the way that I have to go?
[77:54.60]I guess.
[77:59.06]Tell us the lore to Mist.
[78:01.92]I couldn't do that.
[78:03.96]I couldn't do that.
[78:10.52]I don't know.
[78:10.82]Mist is you wake up on an island and you have to figure out why you woke up on the island and then, I guess, leave the island.
[78:16.77]Is that somewhat accurate?
[78:18.79]At least, slightly accurate?
[78:34.56]I couldn't stop.
[78:35.12]That may have just ended the stream.
[78:52.34]I sneezed the shit out of my pants.
[78:55.72]Kidding.
[78:57.24]Where is he?
[79:01.36]Ooh, health.
[79:02.41]I want that.
[79:11.87]Nice health.
[79:13.63]Upgrade.
[79:16.09]Lower.
[79:21.47]He's... No, I'm not.
[79:23.17]I'm kidding.
[79:24.89]I'm filming it.
[79:25.33]I put it to the...
[79:54.29]Sure.
[79:57.01]Don't skip lore, don't skip lore, don't skip lore.
[80:01.32]Don't skip lore, don't skip lore, don't skip lore, don't skip lore!
[80:17.81]you again they tried to bury their sins but instead planted the seeds of their doom a war is coming I've seen it in my dreams fire sweeping over the Earth bodies in the streets cities turn to dust retaliation
[80:39.97]This guy's doing a really great job of doing the random voice lines that play when you spawn for the first time in a League of Legends game as a champion.
[80:58.46]That's kind of all he does.
[81:13.45]Oh, fucked up medical stuff.
[81:14.81]Fucked up medical stuff.
[81:22.47]Dude, you know the game starts to get hairy when there's a bunch of fucked up medical stuff.
[81:28.32]What are they doing in here?
[81:29.66]Alright, I got the upgrade.
[81:36.36]Wait, is this something else?
[81:40.57]No.
[82:03.29]I just ruined this gear.
[82:35.29]Stop stop it What is that?
[83:14.76]Wait, what?
[83:21.21]Why?
[83:22.17]I have to slow down.
[83:25.01]Why did that guy go?
[83:26.11]He did like a push-up.
[83:28.47]Flush him out!
[83:36.35]What?
[83:37.42]How would you know it's me?
[83:39.14]What if I was one of your colleagues?
[83:44.77]What?!
[83:45.13]He's trying to flank!
[83:51.61]No, I'm trying to hide!
[83:52.61]What?
[84:08.18]Shit!
[84:08.76]We lost the man!
[84:32.05]That was not even slowed down.
[84:34.27]That was not even slowed down, but it sounded like it was.
[84:38.84]They all of them have been so far the whole game.
[84:40.66]They've been up shit.
[84:43.46]That one was not slowed down.
[84:45.16]It was not during a slowdown period.
[84:47.18]It was just shit.
[84:55.94]God dammit.
[84:56.86]I love this game.
[84:58.24]What a fun game.
[84:59.06]Look out!
[85:12.88]Grenade!
[85:19.48]looks like we missed the party if anything has taught me anything in my whole life ever since the talkback came out from home alone if you slow anybody's voice down by 30 or 40 percent it's funny every time the talk boy the talk back yeah the talk boy
[85:51.20]Everybody had a talk, boy.
[85:53.43]What?
[85:56.81]What do you mean, heads?
[86:02.87]He dropped it on the... How did you... How did you do that?
[86:08.99]That's impossible.
[86:32.14]They all sound like orcs.
[86:34.04]Like ogres.
[86:36.90]Yes, they do.
[86:37.68]Ugh.
[86:39.40]Ogre.
[86:49.95]Oh, my.
[86:51.21]Oh, looks like we missed the party.
[86:53.25]Oh, man.
[86:55.77]Alright, let's... is the lore in here?
[86:59.84]If there's lore in here, I'm gonna intentionally skip it.
[87:04.28]No.
[87:08.10]What?
[87:12.24]What are they fighting?
[87:25.16]I'm helping!
[87:29.36]Hey!
[87:46.36]He fucking exp... He was trying to get away.
[87:51.76]He was going like... He was trying to like shimmy backwards.
[87:58.36]Just run.
[87:59.48]Why are you doing that?
[88:04.04]Instead of like sliding backwards, turn and sprint.
[88:09.66]Oh my god.
[88:14.03]My doctor's gonna be mad at me.
[88:20.42]I'm supposed to be just like taking it easy I'm sorry doc I I couldn't help it you should have seen what the guy did he flew up I I the guy went was going this way and then he got magnetized his face to the wall and blood splattered he's gonna be like what the are you talking about oh
[88:49.02]cliff doc you gotta see this it's hilarious yeah you don't understand the guy was magnetized and his head hit the wall and blood went there and he like flew this way and the other guy went oh really really slow because time was slowed down and then he stepped backwards and his b exploded
[89:14.12]It's gonna be like, Jeremy, um, I would like maybe to refer you.
[89:18.45]It's like, what?
[89:25.53]Yeah, and then we have this, that 15,000 seagulls were saved.
[89:33.04]Oh, it's a big guy.
[89:52.36]No, it's not skee-ball!
[89:54.37]God damn it!
[90:23.92]Okay, I feel like I'm playing against my little brother in an online multiplayer game, and he doesn't really understand how to actually play in FPS correctly.
[90:32.70]I'm just trying to give him an opportunity to think he's doing a good job.
[91:19.51]Oh shit, it's... Okay.
[91:43.45]That was fun.
[91:45.85]Move your camera.
[91:48.00]No, I can't.
[91:48.82]There's nothing up there for you to see.
[91:49.92]There's all bullshit up there.
[91:52.01]There's nothing up there.
[91:53.01]I can't move it because then if I move it, it'll go in the wrong spot.
[91:55.53]No.
[91:55.85]I'm not going to move it.
[91:57.15]I'm not going to.
[91:57.67]That's the final.
[91:58.79]That's my final word.
[91:59.59]I'm not going to move it.
[92:00.25]I'm not moving it.
[92:11.61]Shit, I think Fettle's going after that Alice Wade chick Bishop mentioned.
[92:15.05]Looks like he's heading for the executive building.
[92:17.05]You've got to get to her before he does.
[92:19.09]She might be able to help us figure out what Fettle's after.
[92:23.17]Locate Alice Wade.
[92:26.89]Easy.
[92:29.71]We've got funny music.
[92:31.33]No, that's not... Alright, this is my shot.
[92:36.23]This is my shot.
[92:36.71]This is my shot.
[92:37.15]I have to make this work.
[92:46.02]Why would you throw a... Oh, shit!
[92:59.87]Why would you throw a grenade?
[93:02.13]Because you saw a light over here!
[93:03.77]Oh, I threw the- whoops, I screwed that up!
[93:07.91]Ah, shit!
[93:10.37]Oh my god, this game is fucking ridiculous!
[93:20.33]Oh.
[93:26.30]He knows what he did immediately after throwing it.
[93:30.14]Oops.
[93:31.90]Oh.
[93:32.86]Oh, shit.
[93:39.71]Really?
[93:45.35]What was that explosion?
[94:02.13]I want to see it.
[94:02.77]Can I see that?
[94:06.39]I want to see it.
[94:07.14]I need to see the grenade.
[94:08.20]Oh, shit.
[94:08.88]I have to.
[94:09.76]Somebody has it, right?
[94:11.94]I need to see it.
[94:15.26]I can hear his intestines melting.
[94:16.66]I just want to watch it.
[94:21.01]You know when you see a really awesome part of the movie and you want to just rewind it and see that part again?
[94:34.36]Mashed banana?
[94:35.38]What the fuck is this?
[94:38.26]Here we go, here we go.
[94:40.97]I just need to see it.
[94:45.59]No, not this one.
[94:50.59]Not this one.
[94:57.80]The one that just happened.
[95:09.84]When he throws the grenade down the hall.
[95:12.33]Oh, here it is.
[95:21.51]Here it is.
[95:21.81]Okay.
[95:22.09]Here it is.
[95:22.43]I just want to see it.
[95:23.15]Just give me a second.
[95:28.96]Why would you throw a...
[95:37.71]The best part about this one is you can't really hear him, but it's on the screen.
[95:48.04]Here.
[95:53.11]Show us.
[95:53.99]You just, no, I just want to see it.
[95:56.93]Back to our regularly scheduled program.
[96:07.34]Whoa!
[96:13.58]You want to fucking go?
[96:14.34]You want to try this?
[96:16.84]You want to do it like this?
[96:18.36]Good.
[96:19.76]Can you throw it?
[96:20.31]Can you get it in here?
[96:21.69]Get a grenade in here.
[96:22.95]Get a grenade in here.
[96:23.57]You can do it.
[96:24.93]Terrible.
[96:25.99]Fucking awful.
[96:26.87]Your buddy.
[96:28.05]I want your buddy to do it.
[96:29.23]One of you, come on.
[96:31.27]I won't move.
[96:31.99]You get it in here.
[96:38.50]Do it.
[96:39.38]Get it in here.
[96:45.44]Nope.
[96:47.16]Not very good.
[96:50.98]This is just the dunk tank again.
[96:54.90]I gotta be up a little higher.
[96:55.80]Come on.
[96:56.62]Up here.
[96:56.92]I don't have any heals left.
[97:18.14]What?
[97:50.01]Let's go.
[97:54.58]I need heals.
[97:54.98]I need a heal.
[97:58.62]There we go.
[98:00.72]Any more in here?
[98:02.41]Come on.
[98:03.01]Give me something else.
[98:03.85]Give me some more.
[98:04.67]Give me some more lore.
[98:06.63]Skip.
[98:28.44]Pistol?
[98:29.39]No.
[98:30.37]No pistols.
[98:34.09]Oh, I already got these.
[98:35.67]Cool.
[98:38.04]What?
[99:01.01]Are you... Are you checking it out?
[99:06.70]Your first instinct is to throw a grenade.
[99:31.36]I thought he was aiming up here.
[99:41.01]Oh fuck, that's a big guy.
[100:00.11]Did he throw a grenade?
[100:00.77]I don't know.
[100:04.78]Alright, it's time.
[100:28.49]Fire every single weapon at that man!
[100:35.62]Do it, hurry!
[100:42.46]Unbelievable.
[100:51.07]He shot me through a wall!
[101:07.89]Flashlight!
[101:08.49]I'm gonna die.
[101:11.45]Hold on.
[101:21.77]Is there a health pack?
[101:23.29]There's probably one secret health pack that I didn't get.
[101:25.59]And I need it.
[101:27.73]Bad.
[101:28.05]I definitely don't need it.
[101:33.62]I don't need it.
[101:37.71]I need it.
[101:52.00]Dammit.
[101:58.15]I'm in trouble.
[102:05.60]He's gonna de- Wait, what do you mean it's gonna de-spawn?
[102:08.18]What are you talking about?
[102:09.50]What's gonna de-spawn?
[102:12.02]De-spawn?
[102:19.42]That big guy dropped Excalibur.
[102:23.83]Well, what the- I don't give a shit.
[102:27.33]I can't use it anyways.
[102:28.45]That's not how Excalibur works.
[102:33.96]You don't just pick up Excalibur and go, this is neat, and use it.
[102:57.53]Nice peek!
[103:04.91]This thing sucks.
[103:09.39]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[103:15.53]Where are you?
[103:16.47]Where are you?
[103:17.07]This is why I don't play games like BR.
[103:21.02]He could be in any of these bushes.
[103:23.14]I have no idea.
[103:24.12]And he could see me and I don't know where he is.
[103:27.34]I don't know where he is.
[103:28.98]No, but he's an awful player.
[103:30.32]He just installed the game like an hour ago.
[103:41.87]Yeah, I don't BR.
[103:43.61]I don't, I don't BR.
[103:45.57]I don't do it.
[103:48.17]Flying low.
[104:02.50]Oh my god.
[104:09.76]How is...
[104:19.23]There's one way you do that.
[104:22.57]You're watching the stream.
[104:26.48]There's no other way that's possible.
[104:33.68]No, I'm in trouble here.
[104:44.29]Let's go!
[104:45.47]Let's go!
[104:46.93]Duck!
[104:57.59]Oh!
[104:59.55]No!
[105:06.42]No!
[105:19.33]I gotta stick him.
[105:44.54]This guy sucks.
[106:01.05]God, what are you doing?
[106:02.05]Did I get hit by him?
[106:04.83]What the hell hit me?
[106:18.46]I'm fucked.
[106:21.88]I'm in deep shit right now.
[106:40.84]Walk forward!
[107:09.87]Shoot it with the gun?
[107:13.97]I've shot him with the gun a thousand times.
[107:26.18]It's not here yet.
[107:28.94]Shoot it until it dies!
[107:32.06]That's good advice.
[107:43.62]Oh my fucking god.
[107:46.65]How did I use all my heals already?
[108:09.40]How could you not make that jump?
[108:11.55]That's ridiculous.
[108:17.04]GET IT!
[108:17.36]GET IT!
[108:17.80]GET IT!
[108:18.18]PICK IT UP!
[108:18.76]WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?!
[108:23.79]What is this?!
[108:25.77]Oh fuck!
[108:26.51]Hold on.
[108:29.21]What do you mean squad?
[108:30.63]Help me!
[108:36.88]Oh!
[108:37.80]Oh!
[108:45.09]He freaked me out so bad.
[108:46.91]I don't know why, he was freaking me out.
[108:53.05]Okay.
[108:53.93]I have to make it into that fucking room.
[108:55.77]But this time, if you have the detonator out, you can't pick up any items.
[109:01.75]Okay, here we go.
[109:03.15]New strategy.
[109:13.64]Start walking down here.
[109:24.07]Is this stupid enough to work?
[110:03.66]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[110:09.88]No!
[110:10.82]Pick it up.
[110:29.37]See you later.
[110:40.46]we can't hit him sir he's behind a glass door
[111:06.68]No.
[111:07.60]You're just watching your life.
[111:08.98]Oh, this is not good.
[111:10.16]Oh, shit.
[111:14.20]That's my line.
[111:15.12]Okay.
[111:20.22]Don't use this.
[111:21.82]That's for emergencies only.
[111:34.85]Good.
[111:39.32]Okay, I thought this was like a Google satellite image of like a warehouse and roads and stuff.
[111:44.02]I was like, whoa, where is that?
[111:45.12]Alright, let's go.
[111:52.52]What's the next step here?
[111:54.52]Computer?
[111:55.50]No.
[111:56.48]No, out here into the left.
[111:58.66]Take out the assault rifle.
[111:59.64]That's got the most range.
[112:00.42]That's got the most range on everything else.
[112:04.12]Up here and through that door.
[112:05.69]Sure thing.
[112:12.82]Can I get more?
[112:25.67]Wait, kill the lights.
[112:31.41]Why would you kill the lights?
[112:34.23]How can you see me in the dark?
[112:36.39]Do you have night vision?
[112:41.33]No, he can't see me.
[112:44.74]I just, like, proved that he... He cut himself off.
[112:56.31]Get down, oh shit!
[113:13.61]Alright, this health.
[113:17.41]It's kinda up against the clock with health here.
[113:20.59]I need some better... skill.
[113:24.59]So I don't keep losing.
[113:26.27]I'll turn the lights back on, for God's sake.
[113:32.83]They were sitting in the dark.
[113:35.15]Now that's embarrassing.
[113:37.80]They were huddled together, terrified, going, I don't know, I can't see anything.
[113:49.49]Nothing else.
[113:52.21]No, we should turn it off again.
[113:58.82]Is that the guy standing?
[114:01.84]What the?
[114:02.06]Contact!
[114:17.64]He, yeah, you think I have attention problems.
[114:44.68]I have to stop laughing at this!
[114:48.71]I have to like... ugh.
[114:56.92]Did you just throw a grenade in a dark room?
[115:57.95]That was pretty awful.
[115:59.35]Okay.
[116:00.59]Health.
[116:05.65]This transmitter's a piece of shit.
[116:22.18]That's all the health that's here.
[116:24.81]Let's go.
[116:25.47]75 HP is not enough HP, especially when you're playing on hard mode.
[116:37.19]It's dangerous.
[116:39.89]That's where I just was.
[116:42.25]Hey, look at this.
[116:44.59]Ooh.
[116:51.11]Nothing here.
[116:56.91]Well, um, there's nothing I can interact with in here?
[117:01.49]That seems a little strange.
[117:05.00]This is like the only place I can go.
[117:09.58]Out the window?
[117:10.30]Because I was just down there, wasn't I?
[117:15.06]Or was I not down there?
[117:18.82]Maybe I wasn't down here.
[117:28.12]I guess I wasn't down here.
[117:37.81]Interval seven.
[117:40.57]Redirection.
[117:46.91]Nothing?
[117:47.37]Okay, cool.
[117:52.47]Locate Alice's office.
[117:56.00]I believe it's probably here somewhere.
[117:58.14]Look at a computer.
[117:59.10]There it is.
[117:59.58]I'm not skipping it.
[118:00.34]Except for me.
[118:01.52]Because I'm the third.
[118:02.38]Or I'm the first.
[118:03.10]No.
[118:03.40]First is the girl.
[118:05.42]Second is Fetal.
[118:06.08]Third is me.
[118:07.20]I mean... Come on.
[118:08.24]Do I need to spell it out for you?
[118:37.73]Okay.
[118:39.64]No health packs.
[118:40.52]That's not good.
[118:42.82]Why?
[118:49.86]Scary.
[118:51.16]Scary thing.
[119:01.73]There we go.
[119:04.69]Handsome mines.
[119:05.78]Good.
[119:18.00]Uh, oh.
[119:18.56]Okay.
[119:22.22]That was kinda creepy.
[119:31.23]Oops.
[119:35.39]What?
[119:43.82]Looks like we're getting in!
[119:49.54]Is human Garfield dead?
[119:50.94]I don't think so.
[119:57.59]It's possible.
[120:11.84]I would assume we'll see that character again.
[120:22.20]Alright here's some lore.
[120:27.70]This sounds real important.
[120:51.40]Received on June 3rd, 1991.
[120:55.14]We're going out this way.
[121:06.33]Now, I think if you work in a corporate environment, you have to listen to your voicemails every morning, don't you?
[121:12.93]That's how it works.
[121:16.71]I want to get that.
[121:17.37]What is it?
[121:27.68]Where's this ringing phone?
[121:31.69]Is it not even in this room?
[121:56.11]I would have loved to have seen whatever scary thing was in here, but the Venetian blinds prevented me from going in.
[122:00.65]Are you serious?
[122:04.25]Really?
[122:04.53]I could just go into that door.
[122:19.16]Where's this phone?
[122:21.02]This is fucking driving me crazy!
[122:28.50]I'm gonna find the other guy's office.
[123:02.64]That's not it.
[123:12.96]Break room?
[123:28.33]I mean, we'll get in, apparently, right?
[123:29.97]No, not yet.
[123:30.73]We can do that later.
[123:33.27]I need to get health.
[123:42.00]Where's this fucking phone?
[123:46.38]Oh, well.
[123:49.80]Maybe in another lifetime I'll get it.
[124:05.22]Oh, it fell.
[124:07.80]Crap.
[124:09.30]Wow, it fell.
[124:10.16]This way.
[124:30.47]Uh... Efficiency is not more important than safety.
[124:48.93]How much further do I have to go?
[124:49.99]Okay.
[124:51.27]Okay, there's a supernatural force blocking the door.
[125:00.82]Nice.
[125:08.87]Supply room.
[125:09.85]Health.
[125:11.81]Give me something else.
[125:12.87]Something more than that.
[125:16.57]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[125:19.09]No, not yet.
[125:19.79]Hold on.
[125:20.09]Is there nowhere else I can go up here?
[125:25.67]Fine.
[125:28.89]I could go up.
[125:30.01]Let me just see what happens if I go up.
[125:37.67]Good thing I went up.
[125:44.03]I'm surprised there's no upgrade up here.
[125:49.84]It definitely is Somewhere right Nope Climb it Climb it down
[126:18.67]Alright, that's fine.
[126:19.37]What was this guy's name?
[126:20.11]I have to find this other guy's office.
[126:24.97]Alright, well, we're at a checkpoint.
[126:26.19]Good.
[126:31.01]And then pick up the phone in his office.
[126:32.53]Man, I hope this chick's alive.
[126:36.34]Nobody's been snacking on her.
[126:43.14]What?
[126:43.28]Wait, these soldiers are eating people?
[126:47.54]I don't think that's what's going on.
[126:51.65]Why was so many of you- Those guys are not eating people, are they?
[126:55.11]Was that ever implied?
[127:01.97]I'm not sure that's the case.
[127:06.85]Holy- What the fucking hell?
[127:18.93]I'm not going over there.
[127:34.35]It doesn't read the lore.
[127:35.43]It starts asking what's happening.
[127:37.39]What?
[127:37.57]I mean, I know what's happening.
[127:47.28]We've listened to all the lore!
[127:52.47]I missed one lore.
[127:53.93]Wait, listen, did you?
[127:55.72]Not really.
[128:27.11]There was that one time when the guy was talking about... Like, why are you not talking to me?
[128:34.96]I'm trying to call you.
[128:36.76]What?
[128:49.09]Got it.
[128:50.65]Anybody left?
[128:51.37]I think that's it.
[129:06.22]I see you up there!
[129:07.08]Oh, and here's another thing, though, about, like, the lore.
[129:24.43]Every time that I open up, like, a piece of lore or listen to the lore, I look over and somebody writes L-Omega-Lul.
[129:30.25]R-E.
[129:33.23]You gotta talk to those people, not me.
[129:37.93]Don't, that, that's, don't, that's, it's not me.
[129:48.00]What?
[129:48.86]You heard the vase break?
[129:53.24]Ow.
[130:01.83]Okay.
[130:02.81]That was a little odd.
[130:16.31]Turn the light off.
[130:24.44]Just use the door like a regular human, please.
[130:26.48]Alright.
[130:39.67]Let's go.
[130:45.21]Alice Wade.
[130:46.97]Hi, this is Alice Wade.
[130:48.49]I just wanted to give you a quick status report.
[130:50.81]We're still collating data, but it's pretty clear that whatever happened to Auburn wasn't because of the usual socioeconomic factors.
[130:57.25]The downturn was actually a symptom of people avoiding or leaving the area for other reasons, which we'll summarize in our presentation.
[131:04.13]One more thing.
[131:05.21]From what we can tell, it all started about 20 years ago.
[131:08.50]I'll let you know when we've got a clearer picture.
[131:10.60]Thanks.
[131:11.90]End of messages.
[131:17.02]Oh, they heard the- they heard the message!
[131:33.45]That like- Who's shooting me from where?! !
[131:51.82]No, you can't.
[131:52.91]Somebody finally gets it.
[131:54.81]Somebody gets it.
[131:56.07]I'm actually surprised by that.
[132:01.33]I don't want to... I'm not going to shoot that guy.
[132:09.87]Weird.
[132:14.72]I got owned.
[132:34.52]Why is there an alarm going off right now?
[132:53.69]Flashlight off.
[132:57.30]Data?
[132:57.86]No.
[133:00.44]Already picked up everything over here.
[133:04.69]Why does this shit make you laugh but fuck doesn't?
[133:08.27]Because they don't say fuck all the time.
[133:11.08]This guy.
[133:25.64]Case in point.
[133:27.80]That's why it's funnier.
[133:39.51]I think that's it, right?
[133:41.73]I still have to go to... Let me see.
[133:46.99]Where, where, where, where, where?
[133:48.61]Where was I?
[133:49.21]I got turned around.
[133:53.79]This door doesn't open.
[133:57.31]So I have to go all the way through here.
[133:59.37]There we go.
[134:06.28]Is that door open?
[134:10.27]Can I go through here?
[134:13.13]Come on.
[134:13.51]There we go.
[134:19.97]Doesn't really do anything for me, just kind of wraps back around.
[134:22.05]Yeah, I know.
[134:27.17]I wanted to go in that other room, though.
[134:30.03]I got the health pack.
[134:33.75]Alright.
[134:34.57]Where the fuck am I supposed to be going, though?
[134:37.33]Locate this guy's office.
[134:43.17]I have not found this office yet somehow.
[134:49.99]Is it not in here?
[135:06.88]I don't... I shouldn't go down.
[135:08.60]Was there a room that I didn't go in up here?
[135:14.09]He's just walking over dead bodies.
[135:15.61]He should have read the lore.
[135:29.02]Was I in the right area?
[135:30.98]I just didn't go in the right spot.
[135:33.90]Well, we'll try it again.
[135:35.74]So this is where I was before.
[135:38.70]So this is like the middle room that goes through.
[135:41.30]Here's like a little break room.
[135:47.44]I guess, I mean, have I gone through here?
[135:49.88]Yeah, because this is a circle.
[136:00.69]This whole corner is just a circle.
[136:04.53]Is there a door here?
[136:10.63]Or do I have to go down?
[136:13.93]Because this is actually just a circle.
[136:18.35]Here we go still spot here feel like I need to get in there Alright Where is your phone?
[136:43.59]Okay.
[136:43.89]Am I in your office?
[136:45.77]I don't think I am.
[137:14.28]What?
[137:17.45]Why did you do that?
[137:35.50]Jesus!
[137:55.34]What's your status?
[137:59.17]Ah, well, I don't know.
[138:00.77]Somebody made a mistake is the status.
[138:03.21]Whatever that is.
[138:17.79]Okay.
[138:21.19]Activate.
[138:22.29]All the doors are now open.
[138:25.67]Oh, that goes into that other room.
[138:26.86]Okay, I know what that is.
[138:34.02]Okay.
[138:36.16]But, I want to explore a little.
[138:39.12]A little bit.
[138:40.42]See if I can get some more stuff.
[138:43.40]Like this.
[138:47.19]Okay, got full.
[138:48.05]I'm going to actually use that for a little while.
[138:51.69]What about this?
[138:55.84]Ooh!
[138:56.30]It's turret time.
[139:28.61]I think I did it!
[139:29.89]How do I get out?
[139:30.37]Okay.
[139:40.92]So that takes care of that.
[139:43.66]Now I just have to go back there and go in that room.
[139:48.26]Easy!
[139:48.58]Yeah, well, just hit a checkpoint anyways.
[140:02.94]Okay, this is back this way.
[140:05.98]There's one of the first doors back here.
[140:07.46]Alright.
[140:10.57]Wait, what is this?
[140:19.11]There it is.
[140:21.70]And everybody's gone!
[140:22.46]I get the place to myself.
[140:25.54]For the first time ever.
[140:37.41]That's hurry up music.
[140:46.77]I... I guess we're just gonna go.
[140:52.03]Why does it want me to go so fast?
[141:04.72]What does it want from me?
[141:20.86]Um... Faster?
[141:24.52]But why did it start here?
[141:25.94]Um... Move, move, move, but there's nowhere to go!
[141:30.79]It wants you to slide kick the bodies.
[141:40.41]Oh, come on!
[141:41.67]Who heard that?
[141:42.45]Is somebody up here?
[141:44.34]This has to be opened.
[141:54.13]Yeah, I think I can't do shit up here.
[141:55.65]I gotta go the other way.
[142:13.99]Holy fuck.
[142:16.09]You lived.
[142:33.28]Wait.
[142:34.42]I thought he was a chair.
[142:39.78]What?
[143:03.02]Okay.
[143:03.90]Uh, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[143:06.22]I don't hate anxiety music in games.
[143:11.92]It makes me feel like I have to rush.
[143:39.57]Good.
[143:39.81]Not bad, let's go.
[143:47.91]Now we've got new music.
[143:52.39]Why is the soundtrack just kicking in for the first time ever right now?
[144:15.38]What?
[144:17.90]Why?
[144:18.24]Why did he say that?
[144:20.33]Wait, why is he?
[144:35.27]Why?
[144:36.06]Why did he move all this stuff?
[144:38.82]Squad check in.
[144:41.28]There's some problems in that troop.
[144:46.93]Shut your fucking mouth.
[145:02.39]Wait!
[145:04.51]Where are they?
[145:08.76]What in the fuck are they using for a weapon?
[145:10.99]It's inside my head!
[145:13.19]It's inside my brain when they fire it, it's firing in my head!
[146:04.15]I'm trying!
[146:05.97]What was that noise?
[146:08.63]That was the... That was an arcade.
[146:15.82]You know when you walk by the arcade?
[146:18.24]Do you wanna know that sound?
[146:20.34]That's the most quintessential arcade sound effect.
[146:24.14]I'm gonna see if I can do it.
[146:25.64]You'll know exactly what I mean when I do this.
[146:27.64]When you're walking by an arcade, or there's an arcade near you, or you're in an arcade, and you hear this sound.
[146:44.68]That's the only sound.
[146:45.48]That's the number one thing you pull from an arcade.
[146:51.65]And I don't even know what machine that is.
[146:59.99]I don't know what it is.
[147:00.67]You just never know what that sound is, but you know it's there every time.
[147:08.28]It's funny because I've never played a game of the arcade that made that sound.
[147:12.60]But I've heard it every time.
[147:15.22]Why?
[147:17.02]Where should I go?
[147:19.32]I wish we just got to shut the fuck up right there.
[147:29.96]There's nobody here!
[147:31.10]There's blood!
[147:33.32]Did he hit his head?
[147:34.25]Oh, he's over here now.
[147:43.13]Oh, shit!
[147:46.09]He's... No, that's... I wanna do better than that.
[147:54.08]The blind boomer.
[147:59.88]Why was there blood here?
[148:00.88]You don't understand.
[148:06.56]There's blood.
[148:07.24]I want... Whatever the gun they have, I want it.
[148:12.37]What the fuck is this?
[148:13.23]It's a shotgun.
[148:14.67]That's not... That doesn't make any sense.
[148:16.17]That's impossible.
[148:17.95]What do you have for a gun?
[148:28.29]So they were shooting from back here.
[148:31.03]Like this.
[148:32.51]With a shotgun.
[148:33.75]And it was like I was being sniped in the head.
[148:37.63]Cactus?
[148:38.17]Yup.
[148:40.93]Good call.
[148:41.51]Thanks.
[148:45.13]It's the Deluxe DLC.
[148:46.84]No, wait a minute.
[148:50.64]Okay.
[148:51.26]Alright, I got three heals now.
[149:00.76]I'm alright.
[149:03.16]Check it out.
[149:17.11]Is there a door up here?
[149:31.78]I got his arm.
[149:39.76]Oh, somebody come on.
[149:42.24]You gotta go through this.
[149:44.30]Through the hole.
[149:46.78]without slovo just bang through the hole he's not gonna move he's actually he's not going to move he's not gonna move he's not gonna move
[150:37.10]Why are they getting so... defensive now?
[150:43.04]They weren't... They weren't doing this before.
[150:44.82]He spun... It's not gonna help you.
[150:58.71]It's a couch.
[151:05.61]What?
[151:05.83]Somebody back here does not want to take orders.
[151:07.37]I saw you!
[151:17.15]Go!
[151:17.79]I can't!
[151:21.57]Easy down!
[151:29.64]Shut the fuck up!
[151:34.96]These guys are fucked.
[151:39.30]They hate each other now.
[151:41.30]What happened?
[151:41.88]They hate each other.
[151:42.87]How do you?
[152:00.90]What do you mean three?
[152:14.15]Oh no!
[152:24.51]Where is he?
[152:27.35]What the?
[152:29.85]I am!
[152:44.23]You're strong.
[152:45.59]You're very strong.
[152:52.46]Big guy.
[152:52.96]Oh.
[153:27.32]Let's go!
[153:28.48]Ooh, nice.
[153:43.27]Oh, I just took a health pack though.
[153:45.33]It's okay.
[153:47.13]It's alright, don't matter.
[153:51.71]Oh, you idiot!
[153:54.84]What in the name of God?!
[153:55.64]What?! !
[154:19.24]I'm almost dead, man.
[154:44.97]He's just waiting for me.
[154:50.14]Oh my god, he's got a skeleton gun!
[155:45.35]Refill.
[155:54.36]Didn't think that was gonna work.
[156:04.27]Let him sleep.
[156:05.11]He's a skeleton inside of there.
[156:12.69]Who the fuck is this?
[156:14.01]Oh, that's, um... That's, uh... Alice.
[156:16.90]Listen... You got all these voicemails!
[156:24.06]You have two new messages.
[156:25.48]First message from...
[156:30.95]Chuck Habegger.
[156:32.27]Arlen, it's Habegger.
[156:34.07]Look, I know how you feel, but I don't see any alternative.
[156:37.21]We need to purge the vault.
[156:39.33]Somebody's gotta go in there and deal with it or this whole situation's gonna boil over.
[156:42.94]If you want to do it for the rest of us, do it for Alice.
[156:47.02]Next message from... Felbeckio.
[156:50.70]Arlen, you were right.
[156:52.18]The crazy bitch is determined to blow this site to kingdom come.
[156:55.74]God knows who she thinks is gonna pick up the pieces when her plan backfires.
[157:23.17]Fall joke.
[157:26.59]You're not one of them.
[157:28.68]I've pretty much given up on being rested.
[157:30.02]Sorry.
[157:31.02]Gotta go.
[157:31.58]Okay.
[157:32.58]Give her a comm link.
[157:46.85]Oh, oh, mega LOL.
[157:48.05]I gotta go.
[157:49.95]You're not one of them.
[157:52.03]I'd pretty much given up on being rescued.
[157:54.39]Thank God she's okay.
[157:55.91]Give her a comm link.
[157:56.97]Okay.
[157:58.36]You have two new messages.
[158:01.48]First message... Hello?
[158:03.30]Miss Wade, we're gonna get you out of there, but you're gonna have to move quickly.
[158:06.40]I need to get to my dad.
[158:07.88]Where is he?
[158:09.18]Some kind of classified facility.
[158:11.26]I've never heard of it.
[158:12.74]There isn't even a street address, just UTM coordinates.
[158:16.11]The entrances are all hidden, but I have passcodes.
[158:21.29]You mean a helicopter
[158:44.88]Can we drive instead?
[158:46.08]My car's downstairs in the parking garage.
[158:47.84]Let's go, car, plus one letter grade.
[158:50.46]Kind of.
[158:51.86]Trust me, you're safer in the air.
[158:54.40]Yeah, right.
[158:58.12]Checkpoint, alright.
[158:59.38]Hurry, let's go get my dad.
[159:02.21]You're not going anywhere but a safe house until this is over.
[159:05.09]What?
[159:06.03]Don't worry, your father will be joining you as soon as we pick him up.
[159:09.43]No way, I'm not going anywhere until I know he's okay.
[159:14.88]LOL!
[159:20.40]I get, okay.
[159:21.72]I'm like, I get like so ADD bored at like such random things.
[159:27.66]Alright, let's go.
[159:28.72]I'm ready.
[159:32.74]No, stop!
[159:33.66]Just go!
[159:34.38]Alright, here we go.
[159:35.38]Go.
[159:36.18]We need to escort to the roof for evacuation.
[159:41.00]Can you handle a weapon?
[159:52.29]How do I get to the roof?
[159:54.93]Oh, you actually have collision too.
[159:56.77]This is gonna be great.
[160:03.55]You have to go up.
[160:05.83]Just go up.
[160:08.33]Good call.
[160:22.90]What a mess.
[160:31.85]Where are you going?
[160:33.11]Where are you going?
[160:34.95]Where are you going?
[160:37.07]Get over here!
[160:38.33]Oh, you're concerned about that.
[160:44.98]Where did she go?
[160:46.66]Okay, where is she?
[160:49.73]Alright, don't... Get the fuck over here, you're freaking me out.
[161:05.92]Okay, hopefully she just teleports with me.
[161:32.72]So, yeah.
[161:38.28]Who said that?
[161:43.89]Excuse me?
[161:55.15]Oh my god!
[161:56.19]Alright, safe.
[162:06.38]Tuber.
[162:08.36]That was not a tuber reaction.
[162:09.92]That was an actual oh my god reaction.
[162:12.42]I have to go back to like the elevators.
[162:29.27]Let's go.
[162:30.79]Up to the roof.
[162:32.97]In.
[162:33.09]In.
[162:37.45]Nope.
[162:37.55]Somebody's crossing the...
[163:02.54]She was about to say the... She was about to say the thing that I said earlier.
[163:06.59]Someone's pressing all the buttons.
[163:10.31]Some fucking... Some... Some little... Some little shit's going down and pressing all the buttons.
[163:15.94]Wait.
[163:16.08]What do you mean close?
[163:16.86]What are you talking about?
[163:20.12]Close!
[163:30.91]It's not voice activated, lady!
[163:32.73]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[163:42.67]With the... Okay.
[163:45.19]Okay.
[164:06.38]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[164:10.84]So close it!
[164:13.91]Close it!
[164:14.63]You have to close it!
[164:15.67]I'm gonna bring people in here with me.
[164:27.21]See if we can get some friends in here.
[164:31.03]Here we go again.
[164:44.09]I mean... I know this is kind of... What do you mean this sucks?!
[165:12.04]I have one health!
[165:21.37]I don't know What Hey
[165:46.90]That was a late reaction.
[165:55.87]Okay.
[165:56.93]Did I turn it back on?
[166:01.91]Oh, no.
[166:02.53]She's dead.
[166:10.72]Can't open this.
[166:11.26]It's offline.
[166:11.84]We just gotta move.
[166:13.60]Save it.
[166:27.83]Can I make it under?
[166:29.40]Definitely not.
[166:34.94]Going up.
[166:46.69]I turned it off!
[167:29.56]What?
[167:46.24]What was the difference from last time?
[168:01.46]Squad, take cover!
[168:04.07]What's the difference between the last fucking first time that I did it?
[168:09.69]That's it.
[168:17.80]That motherfucker heard me stand up.
[168:35.29]freaky knees apparently
[169:06.21]Go.
[169:10.21]Let's go.
[169:12.45]Did this game's source code get leaked?
[169:16.77]I don't know.
[169:18.58]Dead hit?
[169:19.42]That's kind of bad.
[169:26.24]Supply room.
[169:27.40]Damn it.
[169:37.80]It got leaked?
[169:39.20]The actual source code got leaked.
[169:41.18]That's not good.
[169:47.35]After it was released, though.
[169:56.83]There you are.
[169:57.79]How did we get separated?
[169:59.25]How did you get out?
[169:59.71]I remember the power going out in the elevator.
[170:01.73]Then the next thing I knew, I was arriving on the top floor and you were gone.
[170:05.69]You should have a visual on the evac chopper.
[170:08.94]Great.
[170:09.16]Well... I'm laughing.
[170:26.12]I'm not laughing at the explosion.
[170:28.24]I'm laughing at the... Shit.
[170:31.12]Just... Okay, I need to... I want to look this time.
[170:38.22]What?
[170:38.44]I thought it just exploded!
[171:12.24]Did the helicopter just crash?
[171:16.48]What?
[171:21.04]No, right?
[171:31.21]Alright, hold on.
[171:41.06]That guy is so bloody Oh my god Where's the other guy?
[172:15.41]What an idiot.
[172:21.62]What a moron.
[172:22.66]Alright, let's go.
[172:36.45]I'm supposed to cut her off.
[172:42.46]Whatever.
[172:43.54]Flashlight.
[172:44.28]How did we have the same idea every time?
[173:27.97]He fucking made it!
[173:30.27]Wow!
[173:59.68]Pretty good.
[174:25.44]I have to cut her off, so I have to go down there, I think.
[174:27.67]But there could be a health pack.
[174:29.57]And that's much more important to me.
[174:34.21]Than game progress.
[174:44.99]Absolutely ridiculous.
[174:46.85]Which elevator?
[174:47.31]This one?
[174:48.27]No.
[174:51.77]Oh, come on.
[174:53.46]I can't get in there.
[174:58.86]Just have to go down This guy's voice change he's not he doesn't have the accent I
[175:27.68]He used to talk like this, and he's like, that's the... Not anymore.
[175:31.36]He just has a different accent.
[175:44.59]You could have said something.
[175:48.63]Oh, look, another character that is unarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister swords.
[175:58.55]Come with me.
[175:59.15]I don't care.
[176:00.41]As long as one person gets that, I don't care.
[176:03.63]Like, two people will know what that is.
[176:05.29]That's good for me.
[176:06.23]I don't care.
[176:26.59]I wasn't, yeah, I don't care.
[176:28.77]I don't get it.
[176:30.33]Well, I thought better of you guys.
[176:32.13]You didn't get it.
[176:57.56]You didn't get it.
[176:58.64]Alright, fine.
[177:00.70]Didn't get it.
[177:10.92]I see no alternative but to destroy it completely.
[177:14.08]If you have a better suggestion
[177:32.06]There are two ways to make everybody angry in chat.
[177:35.18]Make a Rick and Morty reference or say the word Game of Thrones.
[177:39.00]I think it's a guaranteed way to make everybody angry.
[177:48.14]Do a Game of Thrones reference and everybody will start screaming.
[177:53.58]It's like the new Rick and Morty.
[177:55.66]Remember like season one Rick and Morty?
[177:57.35]Everybody loved it and thought it was like a funny show.
[178:00.75]And then the show kept going and everyone was like, I hate that show.
[178:03.91]Game of Thrones season one and two, that's the best show on TV.
[178:06.99]Now everybody hates that show.
[178:12.54]It's weird.
[178:13.10]Yeah, it's very simple.
[178:14.80]Very simple process.
[178:23.46]Fucking master manipulator.
[178:26.48]Sorry.
[178:34.96]Alright, I'm going over here.
[178:47.57]Master manipulator, but can't fucking follow simple directions.
[178:54.00]You know, we have our weaknesses.
[179:10.11]Well, the master manipulator has a fairly sore sense of direction, as you see very clearly.
[179:17.73]Oh, but once I get out of here, I will put you in a scenario that you'll be very upset that you got it and make you angry.
[179:28.65]And maybe eventually, if I can figure it out, how I even got in here in the first place, I don't fucking remember.
[179:38.37]I actually don't remember how I got in here.
[179:48.16]Found it.
[179:54.06]What's another one?
[179:55.08]What's another show or movie or something that everyone, like, really liked and then everybody hates now?
[180:06.25]I'm trying to think.
[180:10.99]Dexter?
[180:12.69]Yeah, maybe.
[180:14.95]I guess the real moral of that story is if you don't want the word or reference to your show to make everybody puke in their mouths and hate everything about your show, is to just only have five seasons ever of a television show.
[180:29.30]I think that's what it is.
[180:32.84]Think of every TV show that had less than five seasons.
[180:35.62]People remember it very fondly.
[180:42.95]Okay, let's go.
[180:43.51]Five is too many.
[180:49.42]House had eight seasons?
[180:50.18]House did get a little weird at the last like two or three seasons though.
[180:55.34]You know what I mean?
[181:12.18]If House was four or five seasons, I think it would have been fine.
[181:22.01]But then you run into a Family Guy scenario, where Family Guy had like three or four seasons, and everybody loves those fucking seasons.
[181:29.93]Best, wow, that's the most funny, most hysterical show on television.
[181:34.84]Oh my god, I wish they would bring it back.
[181:36.80]Bring back Family Guy, it was so good.
[181:38.94]Everybody, oh, it's my favorite fucking TV show.
[181:42.32]Please bring it back, Fox.
[181:43.75]Please, god.
[181:44.67]It's on Adult Swim now.
[181:45.61]Everybody loves this fucking show.
[181:48.25]And then they do ten more seasons and now here we are.
[181:50.63]Everyone hates that show.
[181:55.80]It's weird how that happens.
[182:00.42]Because they went too long.
[182:01.52]They did it too long.
[182:02.14]They went too long.
[182:10.85]Simpsons was only good back... Yeah, but here's the thing.
[182:13.63]Like, South Park is still good.
[182:26.33]What about that inch?
[182:29.05]Now we're fighting robots.
[182:30.19]Okay.
[182:36.15]No, it isn't.
[182:36.77]What?
[182:43.93]I think South Park is still doing, like, still making fun, funny shit.
[182:53.89]Chat thinks nothing is good.
[182:56.05]That's another thing, too.
[182:57.27]Do you guys like anything?
[182:58.37]Does anybody on Twitch like anything?
[183:08.85]I mean, I have a lot of things that I don't like, but I feel like, does anybody enjoy anything anymore?
[183:14.68]Hold sh- no, I already have that.
[183:24.77]What's your favorite, what's your favorite TV show?
[183:29.79]And don't say Dream of Night Night 5, because we already know that one.
[183:41.14]Should I go in here?
[183:46.24]He took my answer.
[183:47.12]Wait, let me pay attention for one second.
[183:51.56]I want to make sure I don't miss any heals or something.
[183:57.35]Mash.
[183:59.17]Alright, yeah.
[184:07.71]It's probably actually your stream.
[184:10.51]Well, thanks.
[184:16.47]You know, I'm of the opinion we've got we've got like too much media now it's like it's with you could just open up Netflix and Watch every television show ever You got like Netflix Hulu HBO now You've got so many shows and so many movies and
[184:42.31]It used to be you had to wait until that shit was on cable television.
[184:46.87]Once a week.
[184:49.09]Now it's just every two weeks there's like five new Netflix movies.
[184:54.88]Where the fuck do these come from?
[184:56.16]And they're all bad.
[185:04.28]This is a 75 year old opinion?
[185:12.14]I don't think so.
[185:13.62]It's just like, this is a lot.
[185:15.69]Hold on, aliens.
[185:31.44]Can I turn those into a skeleton?
[185:33.14]That'd be cool.
[185:36.22]Everything's in color nowadays.
[185:40.85]No, there's a lot of options.
[185:48.42]Oh yeah?
[185:49.12]Do you see me?
[185:53.89]He's too fast!
[186:00.81]Wait a minute!
[186:12.30]It's making the arcade sound.
[186:13.30]Oh, I'm dead.
[186:16.28]I'm dead.
[186:17.09]I'm dead in that scenario.
[186:18.53]I gotta pull out the other gun.
[186:23.13]When was the last time I saved it?
[186:27.61]Why am I all the way back here?
[186:28.63]Are you serious?
[186:39.38]Why are there aliens?
[186:40.24]No, it's not.
[186:40.68]It's this way.
[186:43.02]I think they're just robot drone attack things.
[186:48.26]I didn't save.
[186:53.26]Sorry.
[187:03.63]Always Sunny is actually hilarious?
[187:05.07]Yes, it is.
[187:05.49]I mean, there's definitely... There are shows that are still good.
[187:09.71]You know what I mean?
[187:14.13]It really does feel like, if everybody loves your show, more than five to eight years later, everybody doesn't like your show.
[187:26.89]Here we go.
[187:40.29]That's why I'm telling you guys, I'm getting close.
[187:43.13]I'm getting close to being over that, like, 10 year seasons.
[187:48.41]When are you guys gonna start hating this show?
[187:50.04]I just didn't even get a chance.
[188:03.05]Was that one of the robots that just said that?
[188:20.12]okay save it here now really yeah really when we already kind of had this conversation before about like oh yeah after spree it was just like come on man like what that's my favorite episode is it will always be my favorite episode
[188:51.82]It was the helicopter.
[188:52.62]Shit.
[188:52.74]I got plenty of heals.
[188:53.44]Let's get a safe right here.
[188:54.42]I think that's a good idea.
[188:55.84]Alright.
[189:21.36]Let's go.
[189:40.53]What the fuck?
[189:55.33]You know I had to do it.
[190:00.65]Okay, just... The word, uh... Okay.
[190:09.69]No, alright.
[190:11.51]Oh, I could be here all day.
[190:13.33]I could do this fucking for like an hour.
[190:16.66]Watch this.
[190:17.08]I'm just gonna drop a grenade.
[190:24.51]Are they alright?
[190:25.15]Uh oh.
[190:28.38]They're okay.
[190:40.12]Holy shit.
[190:40.94]That guy.
[190:41.60]That's the guy in the squad that invited the two guys to play and he's really good at the game.
[190:47.16]Those other two just were doing it because they wanted to make their friend happy.
[190:52.58]I'll get him this time.
[190:55.48]I'll get him.
[191:09.39]There's nobody alive.
[191:16.52]Nobody's alive to say that.
[191:25.87]What?!
[191:48.89]Ooh, nice room.
[191:50.33]Nice room.
[191:54.01]Watch your sti- I know, I'm trying to like, stifle it.
[191:57.82]I'm trying.
[191:59.56]It's going alright.
[192:00.46]It's going alright.
[192:01.24]I'm fine.
[192:02.08]I'm going okay.
[192:07.72]I think we're fine.
[192:12.23]Don't shit yourself laughing.
[192:13.85]I won't, I won't.
[192:14.47]I'll be okay.
[192:20.48]Okay, let's see.
[192:21.96]I don't think there's anything else.
[192:24.08]Wait, should I go downstairs?
[192:26.84]Can I go all the way down?
[192:28.42]Have I ever shit myself laughing?
[192:30.09]No.
[192:31.55]I've never shit... I knew I should have went down!
[192:37.01]No, I have a lot of control over my lower half.
[192:44.60]Don't worry.
[192:45.78]I have a very good amount of control
[192:52.70]How many messages is this guy left?
[193:20.80]I got your message, Genevieve.
[193:24.84]I think what Harlan is trying to say is that we should be leery of knee-jerk impulses.
[193:29.50]I understand there are some time pressures to consider, but we really need to be thinking strategically.
[193:34.38]Reopening the vault at this point strikes me as a dubious proposition, considering all that's happened.
[193:39.50]It's probable that we'd just be adding fuel to the fire.
[193:46.80]think I just I I scared myself doing that a little bit I think I scared a lot of you too stay down
[194:36.41]And there was even an oh shit in there.
[194:40.45]I'm not sure you were paying attention.
[194:44.61]I love that so much.
[194:45.81]It's like my favorite thing.
[194:48.68]They planned this.
[194:51.12]They did all that.
[194:53.48]And the guy still, still was confused.
[195:01.83]Two can play at this game.
[195:07.69]Health packs.
[195:08.35]No, I got him.
[195:10.80]I got him.
[195:11.34]Didn't I?
[195:11.76]I got five.
[195:14.14]I think I got him, man.
[195:15.34]Can't turn it off, sorry.
[195:51.14]What?
[195:51.36]What's... Oh, I thought he was... Okay.
[196:06.23]Nice.
[196:12.71]I thought he was pointing over there or something.
[196:29.95]I can't get him.
[196:30.61]I can't get him off.
[196:33.51]He's stuck there forever.
[196:34.57]That's okay.
[196:58.41]What was the explosion that didn't hurt him?
[197:09.24]Jesus.
[197:09.66]I did.
[197:26.71]Yeah.
[197:27.69]Yeah!
[197:29.19]You gonna let me try out now?
[197:30.37]Psycho.
[197:52.87]Cover up.
[197:53.25]Anything else in here?
[197:55.09]Nope.
[198:25.17]I killed the light.
[198:30.54]Can I use the elevator now?
[198:33.14]I should be able to.
[198:35.20]Power's back on.
[198:44.19]Do my best Joker laugh.
[198:46.85]Um... Maybe, like, maybe later.
[198:53.72]Like, and by later I mean, like, a few weeks.
[198:56.26]You got out?
[198:56.76]What?
[198:56.88]Wait.
[198:57.10]No.
[198:57.70]Why is she going so fast?
[198:59.60]So what, she's going up to the roof right now?
[199:27.32]she gonna try to run me over with her car oh god I hope so I'll be ready is she gonna try to kill me with her car do I have to walk up to the I have to I'm not gonna get there before her she's in like a porsche yeah run up there maybe you'll get there before she does uh

[200:06.89]No!
[200:19.07]How did I miss?
[200:20.25]My crosshair was right on his body.
[200:32.56]You've soiled it.
[200:34.85]Yeah, I did.
[200:36.53]You're right.
[200:37.01]I did.
[200:37.31]I soiled it.
[200:47.45]I soiled it.
[200:58.04]Goodbye.
[201:10.91]Alright.
[201:12.59]Done deal.
[201:13.61]Don't... I can take... I can put that away now.
[201:15.05]Let's get the assault rifle up.
[201:28.52]Lots of health.
[201:29.54]I hope it's a car boss.
[201:31.08]Please be a car boss.
[201:33.92]I would be so happy if it was a... Fight the lady in the Porsche.
[201:53.65]Holy shit, there's a lot of people over there.
[201:59.79]That guy snuck all the way around.
[202:23.10]Alright, I'm going to keep it out.
[202:24.42]No, we're doing grenade.
[202:27.31]Grenade.
[202:29.93]There's a lot of people over there.
[202:31.25]This way.
[202:39.44]This game is epic.
[202:41.84]Yes, it is.
[202:43.28]You're right, it is.
[202:51.79]They don't even know!
[203:05.43]Where?
[203:05.79]Where?
[203:11.85]Nothing?
[203:13.95]Ooh, hold on.
[203:15.85]What about the truck?
[203:20.69]Ooh.
[203:22.68]Refills?
[203:24.56]Don't really need any of them.
[203:29.84]Um... Hold on.
[203:33.63]Just check.
[203:36.97]Nope.
[203:37.39]Let's go.
[203:49.89]Turn the corner.
[203:52.41]G2.
[204:05.98]How do I... That's not gonna do anything, man.
[204:11.26]Holy shit, is that how you stop getting hurt from a grenade?
[204:13.52]Oh!
[204:32.07]I do not have any.
[204:33.31]I'm gonna have to use the electric gun.
[204:53.66]See ya.
[205:02.98]Yeah, electric gun is pretty good.
[205:05.27]What did you have?
[205:06.77]Don't want it.
[205:07.19]Dude, don't... Don't do that to people.
[205:24.60]Good.
[205:28.00]Think I've made it to the top.
[205:31.74]Right?
[205:38.09]Dammit.
[205:38.33]No secret.
[205:40.05]I have to look at that.
[205:40.71]Well, hold on.
[205:41.09]I can't alt-tab.
[205:41.83]When I alt-tab, the game will crash if I don't do it in a very specific way.
[205:45.11]Ooh.
[205:45.27]I did it!
[205:46.67]I did it!
[206:05.42]From Wade's laptop, a right smack in the middle of a Rammelmeyer industrial compound in Auburn.
[206:09.32]The place has been shut down for years.
[206:11.76]Why there?
[206:12.87]Well, I did a little digging.
[206:14.51]No car boss.
[206:15.13]Comes out Armacam popped his sight from the government back in the 50s.
[206:18.37]Get this.
[206:19.09]There used to be some kind of underground military complex in that area.
[206:23.01]I don't think Armacam was interested in what was on the property.
[206:25.81]They wondered what was under it.
[206:43.50]I really thought we were gonna get out of there.
[206:46.36]You know what I mean.
[206:49.67]It looks okay.
[206:50.73]But the pilot's dead and Jin's banged up pretty bad.
[206:53.55]What about you?
[206:54.55]I'll live.
[206:55.05]We're fine.
[206:55.77]But it'll be a while before I can ice skate again.
[206:57.49]Yeah, we're fine.
[206:58.07]We have dialog.
[206:58.75]Alright.
[206:59.51]In that case, I want you to stay with Jin and wait for the medivac.
[207:02.24]You sure you want to send him alone?
[207:03.94]These guys ain't fucking around.
[207:05.88]We don't have a choice.
[207:07.16]Vettel can be anywhere and Alice is out there on her own.
[207:09.70]By the time backup reaches you, she could be dead.
[207:13.13]Oh, it's true.
[207:13.43]It's true.
[207:13.71]Hm?
[207:43.51]Okay, let's go... Can't go in there.
[207:45.93]Can't go in here.
[207:47.99]Kind of a creepy place, though.
[208:13.92]Alright, I thought that was a person folded in half.
[208:18.18]I looked over, I thought that was their legs in the shoes, and that was their body, like, folded up.
[208:31.33]Okay.
[208:33.51]I'm getting condemned vibes from this place.
[208:35.57]That game is great.
[208:39.37]What a great game that was.
[208:50.46]You didn't finish the second one?
[208:54.36]I didn't?
[208:54.66]I didn't finish the second one?
[208:55.60]Are you sure?
[209:00.06]I did.
[209:02.16]Yeah, I did.
[209:13.94]Okay, I think the guy just stepped on his friend.
[209:38.90]Alright, let's get the shotgun going.
[209:49.00]Stuff in this room, probably.
[209:50.30]Was it both of them?
[209:56.64]Oh, I got them both.
[210:16.55]Is he dead?
[210:18.97]I think so.
[210:30.13]What am I looking for in here?
[210:31.41]The enemy patrols.
[210:36.46]I'm just walking.
[210:40.60]What?
[210:54.54]Hello?
[211:03.57]Is this guy dead?
[211:05.07]No.
[211:10.47]Okay.
[211:24.24]Itchy face.
[211:25.04]Itchy face, not good.
[211:28.64]Lethal shoulder injury.
[211:29.74]Not gonna go through here.
[211:36.87]Around this way.
[211:43.59]Uninhabitable, I can't get in.
[211:45.27]Come on, really?
[211:48.01]So how do I get through here?
[211:50.08]I gotta go all the way around?
[211:55.12]Can I make it through here?
[211:57.94]I mean, I can... Not really.
[212:03.34]Should I maybe go down the hole?
[212:04.38]Because I can go... What is that fucking explosion?
[212:19.21]Oh, I do have to go down there, okay.
[212:20.35]Alright, I see the health pack.
[212:32.46]You idiot!
[212:33.56]That might softlock me.
[212:34.50]Oh my god.
[212:44.44]Where are these guys?
[212:45.44]Seriously.
[212:53.40]Oh, you motherfuckers.
[213:08.79]Great.
[213:09.55]Alright.
[213:11.27]That could be... Guy was right here.
[213:39.04]Don't throw a grenade, please.
[213:47.18]Where is he?
[213:54.53]He was gonna- He was gonna say it.
[213:56.91]He was gonna say it.
[213:57.67]I stopped him from saying it.
[213:58.99]He was supposed to say, shit.
[214:03.25]Ah.
[214:11.64]Okay.
[214:20.54]Uh oh.
[214:23.64]Whatever it is, it's big.
[214:34.13]Oh dear.
[214:45.00]You alright?
[214:47.04]Oh my god, he can run through, he can break through all the walls!
[214:52.59]Holy shit.
[215:10.10]Oh fuck, cool.
[215:36.47]I'm gonna use this whole damn thing.
[215:44.21]Holy god!
[215:46.59]I only get five more shots out of this thing.
[215:52.76]It's like the most powerful gun in the game.
[215:54.72]And that took so long.
[215:57.40]Holy shit.
[215:58.28]Okay.
[216:02.50]Well, maybe I can get out of here now.
[216:09.09]What did he destroy?
[216:11.05]Wait a minute.
[216:16.44]Where is this?
[216:17.10]Okay, now this is the right way.
[216:21.96]Watch there be two of those things.
[216:28.86]There's gonna be two of those things.
[217:06.63]What happened?
[217:07.22]It's that motherfucker right there.
[217:34.80]I don't know what they were looking at there, but it wasn't me.
[217:54.06]Where is he?
[217:54.42]Right there?
[217:56.50]Is that- is that him?
[217:57.32]Is that the guy?
[217:59.90]Holy fuck it is.
[218:17.13]Oh, they all have one.
[218:18.01]I wish I could go in that room and get all that ammo.
[218:29.28]That'd be great.
[218:29.90]Alright, we have to make a jump here.
[218:35.22]Is that not where you go?
[218:46.07]Um, is there a little thing on the right?
[218:50.47]Is it that?
[218:51.47]I think that's what I have to do.
[218:56.08]Just... Yeah, it's right there in the number.
[219:02.72]You gotta stand on, like, the brick part sticking out.
[219:17.96]Oh, fuck!
[219:18.94]Whoa, he went the other way!
[219:22.40]God damn it, that sucks.
[219:24.34]Do I really have to restart this again?
[219:25.73]I don't think- I can't cross over here.
[219:34.97]So, is it really just that simple?
[219:38.17]No, it's not, is it?
[219:38.99]I don't think I can do this.
[219:42.79]That looks like you stand there and jump to there.
[219:47.74]I admit, that's maybe not what you're supposed to do.
[219:53.77]I don't think you're supposed to do that.
[220:00.27]But I did it.
[220:09.63]I got a lot of ammo for this thing.
[220:20.77]Okay, I'm... I need to start using that.
[220:26.25]I'm just target practicing.
[220:33.06]Let's go.
[220:37.78]Who else is here?
[220:38.48]Anybody else?
[220:40.92]Oh, wow, look at you.
[220:42.83]That's what I get for talking.
[220:44.17]Shit.
[220:44.95]I don't... Why am I talking?
[221:02.97]Help backs?
[221:03.43]No.
[221:09.32]Alright, here we go.
[221:34.09]Where's this other guy?
[221:35.53]There's three of them, and then there's another guy over here somewhere.
[221:42.42]Up on the roof, I think.
[221:43.30]Okay.
[221:54.92]Anybody else?
[222:05.73]Okay, that was a bad place to save the game, but it's okay.
[222:24.70]Alright, save it right here.
[222:31.31]Anybody else, right?
[222:33.35]Don't just pop out of the window and shoot me in the head, please.
[222:41.57]Yeah?
[222:42.09]What's... Just one person.
[222:49.33]Oh no, how scary.
[222:51.96]Why is this so scary?
[223:01.77]That was... They had... They played specific music to be scared of that guy.
[223:18.58]He's playing this on easy, this is on hard.
[223:29.26]What's with all the meat?
[223:38.46]I can't see shit in here.
[223:43.98]He flew up so fast that the top of the door guillotined his head.
[223:51.03]That was fucked up.
[224:13.36]Are these the- ooh, gimme that.
[224:15.16]These are the guys with the lightning- the electric guns.
[224:19.98]That's pretty great.
[224:21.66]How much do I have now?
[224:23.34]28.
[224:24.54]Nice, that's awesome.
[224:36.56]Where is he?
[224:39.28]Where the fuck is he?
[224:40.56]Where is he?
[224:47.07]Check it out.
[224:47.71]So where is he?
[224:57.74]No.
[224:58.52]I'm going to run right into him accidentally over here.
[225:06.08]He's over there.
[225:06.92]What?
[225:11.31]What?
[225:16.93]Why is he talking?
[225:21.43]I thought he was talking.
[225:24.43]I was trying to listen to him.
[225:25.63]I thought he was having that conversation with the guy.
[225:28.49]Oh, inventory.
[225:29.05]We had a Blackhawk helicopter.
[225:30.41]Crap.
[225:34.32]Oh, shit.
[225:37.42]This one in my bird.
[225:45.49]Okay.
[225:45.71]What?
[225:46.05]Ooh, there's a health thing in there.
[225:48.31]Is he alive?
[226:45.32]found him he was outside on the side
[226:57.45]This place sucks.
[227:02.71]Alright, give me the upgrade.
[227:07.44]170 health.
[227:09.82]Seems pretty good, doesn't it?
[227:12.58]OK, let's go.
[227:30.17]Get in there.
[227:30.57]Alright.
[227:43.58]Oh, there she is.
[227:44.20]The girl that drove off in her car.
[227:47.67]I should liquidate you right now.
[227:49.27]Wait, is somebody behind you?
[228:22.34]No flashlight.
[228:22.90]Somebody in here?
[228:34.71]What?
[228:35.15]What happened?
[228:35.79]What happened?
[228:38.12]What?
[228:49.74]She told me so many things.
[228:57.47]Is she dead?
[229:05.92]No, it was just a pot and a piece of cardboard.
[229:16.23]No, not this.
[229:35.34]I took damage in my dream?
[229:36.88]That's bullshit.
[229:40.53]That's not how it works.
[229:59.01]Damage, yeah.
[230:01.31]I took damage in my dream.
[230:02.91]That's not how that works.
[230:04.87]You can't get hurt in your dreams.
[230:13.03]Yes, you can.
[230:16.23]Yeah, maybe if you're having a dream about something and you punch yourself in the face in the dream, maybe.
[230:23.88]If you, like, roll around and, like, roll out of bed and hit your head on your night table next to you, then yeah.
[230:35.80]If you, like, sleepwalk making eggs and you put your hand in the pan... Yeah.
[230:50.27]I don't wanna go that way.
[230:56.23]Wait, there might be a health pack in here.
[231:01.95]No.
[231:07.35]What the hell was that?
[231:08.95]Give him back.
[231:12.52]That is the exact TV that I used to hide under my blanket and watch WWF Wrestling when I was younger.
[231:18.52]The exact television.
[231:30.81]That's not the right gun Alright, let's move now
[232:03.39]Why do they do that every time?
[232:05.56]It's almost like the game knows when I press the grenade button.
[232:25.69]Not this time.
[232:33.42]That's fucking ridiculous.
[232:41.42]Okay, I need to slow down.
[232:45.36]In my brain, there was no possible fucking way that there was going to be another person inside of that truck.
[233:02.49]Impossible.
[233:08.49]Oh no, I can't get in.
[233:18.29]Checkpoint, good.
[233:23.36]Mmm, two health packs.
[233:24.90]What are you preparing me for?
[233:27.78]What are you preparing me for?
[233:42.61]Wait.
[233:47.27]This is important.
[233:47.89]I just want to see if it's possible to get hit by the- Yes, it is.
[233:55.42]Okay.
[233:55.62]I needed to make sure.
[233:57.00]I didn't want to see if it was possible.
[234:11.22]Did I just drop that?
[234:30.01]Does anybody know what happened?
[234:33.80]Spawn camping.
[234:36.76]Spawn camping.
[234:40.14]Spawn camping.
[234:41.66]Did somebody throw... Spawn camping.
[234:53.22]Who the fuck are you?
[234:55.28]That's so funny.
[235:10.25]Hello?
[235:15.31]Idiot.
[235:16.31]Uh-oh.
[235:19.99]It's like a... It's one of those... Okay.
[235:29.24]This... This spawn killing.
[235:34.68]It's gonna make me laugh every fucking time.
[235:51.36]Okay.
[236:06.23]I would laugh if they just kept spawning.
[236:12.25]Like why wouldn't they be able to get out?
[236:21.27]Just hold down left mouse button.
[236:23.49]One of you will kill me.
[236:28.01]Even when there's a hacker, all you can do is hold left mouse button out the door.
[236:51.18]More in there now.
[236:52.10]Okay.
[236:59.88]Were there four in there last time?
[237:31.24]Okay.
[237:32.26]That's that.
[237:36.24]I want to be, like, in that perspective.
[237:39.12]I've been in that perspective before.
[237:40.60]That perspective is just a guy going... speed hacking back and forth and just holding down the mouse button that auto-aims to your head.
[237:49.90]And all of us just in there like, oh, no!
[237:52.64]Hold on!
[237:53.24]Wait, wait, just pocket medic me!
[237:54.40]Uber me!
[237:55.50]Uber me!
[237:55.80]We'll get out!
[237:56.56]We'll get out and just... Everybody, five medics!
[238:03.16]I know what that's like.
[238:03.92]It was bullshit.
[238:06.10]Alright, I got full armor.
[238:39.70]No.
[238:40.82]I don't want it.
[238:50.09]Something's about to happen here, so I'm gonna... I don't know.
[238:55.27]Something's gonna bust through.
[238:56.45]Yeah, look at all these health packs they're giving me.
[238:58.93]This is gonna be a fight against something.
[239:02.54]Through here.
[239:02.96]No?
[239:03.96]Really?
[239:04.32]Really?
[239:06.53]I'm surprised.
[239:07.11]Oh.
[239:12.27]Okay, we're going over the fence.
[239:31.64]Can't jump it.
[239:33.46]There's a door right here.
[239:37.68]It's the revenge of the... Wait, where is it going?
[239:52.25]Where is it going?
[239:58.61]Is it backing up?
[240:05.70]You still alive?
[240:09.77]He fell in the window.
[240:14.17]Yeah, that guy didn't know what the fuck he was doing.
[240:31.66]Check the back of that car.
[240:46.52]I was too focused on that guy.
[240:59.21]Cool Anything else?
[241:05.04]No?
[241:14.78]Largest concentration.
[241:16.08]This is gonna be fun now, isn't it?
[241:30.05]Scaffoldings?
[241:36.39]Okay, nothing down here.
[241:49.43]I don't get to be a badass, like I was told.
[241:59.32]Save it here.
[242:01.12]I need to use the bathroom.
[242:02.96]I've got to use the bathroom.
[242:04.12]I've got to pee.
[242:05.88]So let me get in a spot in the corner here.
[242:09.50]I'll be right back.
[242:10.50]I have to use the bathroom.
[242:13.40]In game?
[242:13.84]No.
[242:14.10]Like, in real life.
[242:15.30]I'll be right back.
[244:49.90]Alrighty.
[244:56.33]I have returned.
[245:05.36]Hello.
[245:11.46]So I feel like we're getting to the...
[245:15.77]The last leg of the game, if I were to take a guess.
[245:18.71]I would say this is probably it.
[245:23.81]Eliminate enemy patrols.
[245:25.61]Is this another sniper section?
[245:39.56]Oh no.
[245:41.26]Another fucking car.
[246:01.03]There was a whole squad in there.
[246:06.17]They were ready.
[246:07.15]They're sitting in the back.
[246:08.05]Let's go.
[246:08.59]We're gonna do it.
[246:09.27]We're gonna kill this motherfucker.
[246:13.77]I don't know what the driver is doing.
[246:17.56]Why would you do that?
[246:25.58]He's like, hey, Tom, Tom, he's right there.
[246:30.96]Tom, you're still going.
[246:33.51]Tom, you're going over the cliff.
[247:00.52]Okay.
[247:03.61]He knows we're fighting.
[247:04.71]You know what I've noticed a lot more in this part of the game here?
[247:11.11]Not a whole lot of enemy talking.
[247:14.57]I think they're... I think they're trying to focus.
[247:21.26]Well, two can play at that game.
[247:23.14]I just won't talk either.
[247:36.35]Nevermind they're talking That is unbelievable that he still was able to get that off he got ten seven or eight bullets in his arm and his body and he still pulled it off and
[248:01.54]His angle even changed.
[248:07.28]What happened?
[248:14.57]Oh, there was a tank right there.
[248:25.80]Nice.
[248:46.37]Is he still alive?
[248:53.44]Bite the legs.
[248:55.08]Alright, I gotta get up.
[248:57.20]Hold on.
[248:57.52]Check, check, check, check, check.
[248:59.74]Check.
[249:00.70]Check.
[249:01.14]We're good.
[249:02.66]Check.
[249:03.67]Get up.
[249:06.47]One health pack.
[249:20.61]Did he just dodge it?
[249:23.31]He went like this.
[249:28.33]Holy shit, man.
[249:37.01]I can't... Where do I go from here?
[249:38.59]I gotta jump from here to there?
[249:42.11]Okay.
[249:42.95]I have to jump?
[249:43.91]No, I don't.
[249:44.45]It's right here.
[249:52.76]Health upgrade?
[249:53.32]Yeah, I know.
[249:53.72]I'll get it.
[249:54.06]I think I have to go around for the health upgrade like this.
[250:00.63]Yeah, see?
[250:03.59]Well, it's not a health upgrade, but... Still good.
[250:11.72]I do want to go up here and see if there's anything over here, though.
[250:15.99]We'll check.
[250:23.43]There is.
[250:26.93]Body armor is nice, but I don't really... This doesn't open right now.
[250:35.99]Nothing.
[250:38.63]No fall damage, right?
[250:44.84]Let's go.
[250:57.42]Down or around?
[250:58.18]Probably around first.
[251:03.21]Spawn camp.
[251:05.91]Are they just sitting in there waiting for me to do something?
[251:15.16]Alright, I'm going to surround the outside with stickies.
[251:20.32]And the second I see the door open, right click.
[251:24.08]and then watch the chat room and watch everybody in that spawn talk about how much of a piece of shit I am.
[251:35.82]That's gonna open, right?
[251:38.53]I'm taking a gamble that this is going to open.
[251:40.91]That's just a gamble.
[251:41.79]I'm just playing the odds.
[251:43.39]Okay?
[251:48.79]I'm just playing odds.
[251:50.37]I can pick them up if it doesn't happen.
[251:53.04]There's also a health upgrade over there, I think.
[251:54.62]Okay.
[252:03.82]Is it going to open?
[252:10.43]It might.
[252:11.33]It actually might.
[252:12.69]I might have to turn something on, and all of a sudden, boom, it opens.
[252:20.90]Doesn't look like it.
[252:26.83]If that happens though, just know that I was thinking about it.
[252:31.58]Alright, let's make this smart.
[253:08.60]Wait, wait, don't do it yet.
[253:09.75]He's almost here.
[253:10.33]You're not gonna... Why do you guys always do this?
[253:34.38]Oh!
[253:39.81]You... Alright, you're actually pretty smart.
[253:43.78]Everyone else is stupid.
[253:49.74]Never mind.
[254:04.64]You're all idiots.
[254:05.48]You're idiots.
[254:05.92]So...
[254:15.04]No, not you guys.
[254:16.56]No, what are you talking about?
[254:21.49]I'll put words in my mouth.
[254:22.51]That's not what I said.
[254:23.41]That's not what I said.
[254:25.01]I mean, it is what I said, but I was referring to these.
[254:30.51]These idiots.
[254:33.66]Okay, let's save it here.
[254:38.52]Nobody's mad in that room.
[255:04.54]Is he stuck?
[255:08.84]I think he's stuck in the wall.
[255:27.64]um I can't open the door well I don't think I have to worry about that guy anymore okay I heard a grunt and then
[255:56.03]There was a loud grunt and then he stopped moving and his leg was sticking out of the wall.
[256:05.66]You motherfucker.
[256:09.94]Wait.
[256:11.10]That's not you, is it?
[256:36.99]You guys are the worst.
[256:41.03]Alright, back to the shotgun.
[256:46.06]Armor.
[256:51.34]Oh, he didn't get stuck.
[256:52.54]He just walked back behind this way.
[256:56.62]And he walked the whole time.
[257:06.43]He walked a long way.
[257:10.26]A very long way.
[257:13.58]It was actually in my favor though.
[257:22.52]I'm gonna use it.
[257:26.74]I need some big heavy weapons.
[257:30.04]There's a lot of those big guys now.
[257:32.54]So I'm gonna use it on the big guys.
[257:40.73]okay this is she's close now her presence is strong here thanks for the info nothing down
[258:03.93]Who touched?
[258:04.49]Wait, a heavy?
[258:05.15]No, I'm just talking like straight up.
[258:08.23]Like heavy.
[258:09.79]Like a heavy gun.
[258:11.77]Like heavy weapons.
[258:12.91]Not the heavy weapons guy.
[258:14.13]Well, I mean, a heavy weapons guy uses heavy weapons.
[258:26.33]Really?
[258:26.65]What the fuck?
[258:30.55]That guy's not... They're so accurate with these.
[258:34.11]How is that guy not dead?
[258:49.10]Okay, I need someone to explain how that guy's alive.
[258:53.98]I need someone to tell me what happened and why, where is he now?
[259:05.00]He didn't, but I shot him with... What the fuck does he have for a gun?
[259:25.21]Hold on.
[259:25.65]Okay, he has a repeating cannon.
[259:31.13]So these guys are much... They're much harder.
[259:33.85]Alright, I gotta bring out the real thing here.
[259:38.63]He's... That's not gonna hit me!
[259:40.83]It's not gonna hit me!
[259:41.83]You're in a room by yourself!
[259:52.85]Oh no, your leg!
[259:54.47]Your leg is hurt!
[259:59.48]Alright.
[260:02.75]This thing.
[260:03.23]Look at this.
[260:06.15]I love how we dove out of the way, too.
[260:11.69]Okay.
[260:12.49]Let's check it.
[260:13.09]Is this thing going to be good?
[260:17.36]We'll try it.
[260:17.84]Repeating cannon.
[260:21.82]Oh, nice.
[260:22.48]Okay.
[260:23.06]That gave me a lot of ammo for this.
[260:27.68]Very cool.
[260:29.72]Let's shoot somebody with this and see what happens.
[260:42.82]Good.
[260:44.05]Good.
[260:45.23]Up the ladder.
[260:48.59]This is the best weapon in the game.
[260:52.25]I wonder what it does.
[260:52.87]I'm looking forward to shooting my first person directly at the chest.
[261:04.04]This is where the little door that I couldn't go through earlier.
[261:25.48]In more ways than one, I think.
[261:27.20]Okay, I need that bad.
[261:31.00]Do I have shark?
[261:35.64]Yeah, I got plenty of shark anymore.
[261:40.48]This is very funny.
[261:44.22]I mean, I'm just saying.
[261:49.60]minute just saying do I have any regular okay I got a lot of regular grenades it's a little too quiet
[262:19.52]I knew it was quiet I don't like that outcome
[262:49.55]that's better okay I actually like the shotgun for this better
[263:23.63]Where is he?
[263:28.03]There he is!
[263:35.18]Default shotgun is just the best weapon.
[263:39.23]No matter what scenario.
[263:41.87]It's just the best.
[263:58.14]That was a good faceplant on the corner.
[263:59.72]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[264:16.23]Where is he?
[264:17.83]Where is he?
[264:21.15]Nope, I think that's it.
[264:57.21]Nice work.
[265:33.52]Banned for grenade spam.
[265:50.57]Keep at it.
[265:51.07]Keep at it.
[265:51.57]Keep at it.
[265:52.03]I'm coming.
[265:53.19]I'm coming!
[266:03.66]Uh-oh.
[266:12.01]Oh, here he is.
[266:36.85]Why did he go back?
[266:44.90]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[266:47.32]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[266:48.94]This way.
[266:51.38]Don't de-aggro to your original spot.
[266:57.58]I need that.
[266:58.44]I need you to step on that.
[267:00.08]I need this.
[267:03.86]Okay, I'm getting high ground here.
[267:17.57]Give me some... Oh, fuck.
[267:45.38]God damn it.
[267:52.76]He hit me right in the face.
[267:53.54]Done.
[268:03.38]Now what?
[268:06.60]You cheesed him?
[268:08.05]How else are you supposed to kill those guys without cheesing them?
[268:10.59]That's the whole point.
[268:12.57]The entire point is to cheese that.
[268:14.43]Because it's impossible.
[268:16.39]You have to cheese that.
[268:53.39]Got it.
[268:53.67]There's probably a third one, too.
[268:57.96]I thought that was a gun.
[269:02.64]It's an arm.
[269:05.80]And I thought that was a frying pan.
[269:07.88]But it's a tire with a thing sticking out of it.
[269:09.92]I wasn't even gonna say anything, but I guess I just did.
[269:19.51]No healing sticks.
[269:22.72]Is this the guy that beat... yeah.
[269:26.74]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream and I'm incredibly proud of it.
[269:30.80]And the DLC.
[269:38.52]That's not even an achievement anymore.
[269:45.42]I want to hear that conversation.
[269:50.56]I didn't know they were behind me at this point.
[269:57.33]It's okay, I want to hear that whole conversation.
[270:08.36]Come on.
[270:12.88]That's unbelievable.
[270:14.12]How the fuck would you even rip around?
[270:18.23]Yeah!
[270:28.63]Yep, come on out!
[270:29.67]Everything's fine!
[270:33.06]We got him!
[270:35.14]That fucker's dead!
[270:36.12]Okay, it's time to just use my tried and true.
[271:12.99]He's here!
[271:14.65]We've got a man down!
[271:19.19]Everybody take cover!
[271:28.26]You alright?
[271:31.52]Are you talking to me?
[271:32.20]Like, actually me?
[271:49.95]I mean, if I'm in that scenario, and this is super, like, he's, like, sprinting around speed hacking, and I'm gonna be like, hey, man!
[271:57.93]Nice!
[271:58.41]What are you doing later?
[272:01.88]You wanna, like, hang out?
[272:03.80]I guess, I don't, um, no, you did it, good work!
[272:07.30]What are you gonna do?
[272:11.10]And then be like, yeah, nice job, when he's not looking.
[272:15.43]And then be like, I did it!
[272:22.15]Where do I go?
[272:29.93]Oh.
[272:30.29]What the hell is that?
[272:31.66]What?
[272:36.98]Okay.
[272:41.73]I guess you have this whole area back here.
[272:53.03]I don't have any at full health, so that's good.
[273:25.37]Uh... What is this attached to?
[273:38.22]I get, um... This is Baby Bear.
[273:41.86]Medivac just got here.
[273:43.30]Glad to hear it.
[273:44.62]Thanks for the help.
[273:45.44]Wish I could've known.
[273:46.60]Kick some ass.
[273:48.32]Kick some ass, okay.
[273:50.76]Uh, so, we can go down here.
[273:56.24]I was just in here.
[273:57.76]But wait.
[273:58.86]I didn't look at this.
[274:04.06]No?
[274:08.21]I guess I don't need to do anything there.
[274:10.27]What about through here?
[274:11.01]There's like an elevator up there or something.
[274:17.45]There's two skylights.
[274:20.74]That just leads to this one.
[274:25.53]I'm getting nerd-neck, am I?
[274:31.57]I feel like I have to do something with this.
[274:32.79]I can't, like, drop it?
[274:40.10]I mean, obviously I have to get up there.
[274:44.60]The question is, how?
[274:49.02]And why can't I open... This door didn't open last time.
[274:55.75]Why is it open now?
[274:59.51]I tried to open it.
[275:00.17]I pressed... I did.
[275:01.67]You can go back and look.
[275:02.43]I really did.
[275:03.03]I promise.
[275:06.37]I did.
[275:06.71]I really did.
[275:07.61]Alright, let's go left.
[275:20.82]Health upgrade!
[275:21.66]Yeah. 175.
[275:31.85]Why do I sound scared?
[275:32.84]Um, I'm not scared.
[275:39.66]I'm... Well, I'm a little flush and queasy.
[275:43.75]But that's for other reasons.
[275:48.17]Did I just fall?
[275:57.88]What was that?
[276:04.28]Uh, here we go again.
[276:05.56]Hey!
[276:41.79]Okay, I'm... alive.
[276:46.80]And did I... I didn't even go anywhere.
[276:59.23]Cool, you wasted ammo.
[277:00.87]Well, they would have killed me.
[277:05.68]Thank you.
[277:05.98]Incursion.
[277:36.13]Okay, ah, okay wait That didn't do anything Dead I'm dead
[278:15.94]I'm glad you regenerate to at least 25.
[278:17.96]That would be so awful if you didn't.
[278:23.86]Well, on hard, it really doesn't matter.
[278:25.73]Because if you get shot like two or three times on hard, you just die.
[278:31.45]So maybe that doesn't matter.
[278:32.43]No, that's not an alarm, right?
[278:53.25]Wait, just check for, like, health packs.
[278:56.41]I don't... I am in the market for them.
[279:00.06]Here we are.
[279:04.02]Go that way.
[279:05.64]Go up here.
[279:11.47]Nothing?
[279:11.85]Okay.
[279:13.19]Let's check over this way.
[279:25.88]Multiple ways to go.
[279:27.86]I'm just going to go through the vent.
[279:35.38]Oh, nice.
[279:35.80]I haven't had these in a long time.
[279:41.79]Alright, can I break this one?
[279:45.93]I can't go through this.
[279:46.69]Alright, it was just two grenades.
[279:49.35]It's fine.
[279:57.81]Okay.
[280:02.76]Let's go down.
[280:03.76]I don't think there's much else for me to do here.
[280:20.53]Still no health.
[280:30.05]Wait, hidden?
[280:32.01]No.
[280:34.35]Nope.
[280:45.56]Hi, guys.
[280:48.82]It's the last thing you're ever going to say.
[280:50.60]Ooh, I got him on the way down.
[281:15.54]Are you?
[281:27.90]It's Garfield.
[281:28.98]It's human Garfield.
[281:29.76]Do I get to kill human Garfield now?
[281:34.11]I really hope I do.
[281:45.40]Hey, remember me?
[281:47.02]I'm coming for you!
[281:51.18]You don't have very much time remaining!
[281:53.32]Oh, that sucks.
[282:11.53]I'm gonna die.
[282:25.95]Let's go.
[282:27.47]I'm going to pull out.
[282:28.21]I'm going to do, yeah.
[282:29.85]No.
[282:30.21]Yeah.
[282:32.35]It's probably the best.
[282:32.95]Let's do it.
[282:54.21]Best gun in the game.
[283:04.53]I do not know the power of one guy.
[283:07.57]One guy... can seriously change everything.
[283:11.75]That's right.
[283:19.93]Attack me during a cutscene?
[283:21.42]Fucking coward.
[283:22.94]Coward!
[283:24.32]Attacks me during lore.
[283:25.74]Coward.
[283:28.22]He's peeking around the side.
[283:34.04]Yeah, and now I'm gonna make your life a living hell.
[283:38.23]I'm killing you with this scary gun.
[283:56.17]The genetic reference they used for the program was apparently a powerful psychic.
[284:00.17]Makes sense.
[284:01.31]If you want a telepathic commander, you could tell a man.
[284:04.29]And there was a woman.
[284:05.45]It says here she gave live birth to the prototypes.
[284:08.80]It seems Wade wasn't expecting the psychic characteristics were genetic.
[284:12.20]He figured there was a better chance he'd be passed along if the fetus gestated inside the subject.
[284:15.92]So they put her in a coma, made her carry a genetically engineered baby to term, then induced labor.
[284:23.24]Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing.
[284:25.16]You took the words right out of my mouth.
[284:27.04]That's really fucked up.
[284:28.30]Okay.
[284:33.05]Let's go up.
[284:51.28]Go up and... Can I crawl over?
[284:54.22]I think I can crawl over the whole thing.
[284:58.44]Oh, that's sick.
[284:59.38]Nice.
[284:59.64]Alright.
[285:05.74]I'm gonna drop in on him.
[285:10.72]Spider-Man meets Fear.
[285:12.44]Why would it be Spider-Man?
[285:29.23]He's not in here again.
[285:32.27]When is the final confrontation gonna be with this guy?
[285:35.77]He keeps just barely getting away.
[285:39.82]Come on.
[285:41.44]Alright, okay.
[286:02.64]I mean, I'm going to do what I want to do.
[286:04.08]It's me.
[286:05.04]It's my life.
[286:06.48]So I'm going to decide what I... I decided to shoot that guy.
[286:11.69]Because he was dangerous to me.
[286:24.65]These are all explosives.
[286:44.39]Yes!
[286:47.29]Alright, full health pretty much.
[286:50.08]That's all I need.
[286:53.66]Just like my father when we used to play Mario Brothers.
[286:57.90]See, my dad was not like necessarily really great at video games, but we had the regular Nintendo.
[287:05.63]And...
[287:07.29]What he would tell us to do, we had regular just Super Mario Brothers, right?
[287:11.47]And he would tell us if we got him to the last level with five lives, that he would beat the game for us because we couldn't do it.
[287:20.68]So we would always just try to get to the end and have five lives and be like, Dad!
[287:26.58]Dad, you have to beat the game!
[287:27.78]We got five lives at Bowser's Castle!
[287:31.70]And he'd come over and be like, alright, excuse me, let me sit down.
[287:34.36]And he would do it every time.
[287:36.45]But we had to have five lives, though, because there was a couple places where you knew he was gonna die, like, three or four times.
[287:42.39]Uh, how do I... I guess we're going this way.
[287:52.82]Gamer dead.
[287:53.40]It was only with that, though.
[287:54.50]It was only with Mario Bros.
[287:57.70]He didn't really play anything else.
[288:02.12]It was pretty wonderful.
[288:07.01]but he wouldn't beat the game for us.
[288:10.53]What?
[288:13.08]I had nothing to do with that one.
[288:18.16]Uh oh.
[288:20.38]Uh oh.
[288:25.43]Okay, we're gonna have to do this strategically.
[288:41.97]One more.
[288:47.93]I gotta like use the force to find out where the fuck this thing is!
[289:01.93]That was not fun.
[289:13.93]Back to the regular shotgun, please!
[289:30.80]Gentlemen?
[289:35.34]Not a very good hiding spot.
[289:43.07]Oh, it's not explosive, come on Grenade!
[290:18.78]That was a silent under the breath shit.
[290:23.66]You did that.
[290:24.70]You're the one that killed me.
[290:26.39]You're the one that finally got rid of me.
[290:29.41]You finally killed me.
[290:31.53]Outplayed me completely.
[290:34.95]Shit.
[290:37.45]I love this game so much.
[290:39.71]It's so... It's so stupid.
[290:53.38]Which way?
[290:53.98]Oh my god.
[290:55.24]What a fucking fun game.
[290:56.24]These guys are... I feel bad.
[291:33.08]What the fuck?
[291:35.34]Why is he not skeleton?
[291:47.69]Oh, no, no, no, no!
[291:52.41]Panicking.
[291:55.96]I panicked like a lot.
[291:58.36]A lot.
[292:15.52]Okay, cool.
[292:32.18]More health.
[292:35.60]Alright, that's not a terrible place to be in.
[292:38.50]Just don't want to die down here.
[292:40.94]Turn off the light.
[292:42.49]Reload the gun.
[292:44.17]And get ready for that.
[292:45.57]And we're going to do a wall bounce here.
[292:47.05]No, I don't think I need to.
[292:55.86]He backed into it.
[292:56.88]He stepped... You idiot.
[293:04.78]Did you kill everybody too?
[293:05.76]You did.
[293:07.06]Nice work.
[293:08.78]Did I overthrow that?
[293:37.16]I got him.
[293:38.20]I got that guy.
[293:39.06]I really did.
[293:51.14]What's over here?
[293:56.59]Nothing?
[293:57.25]Okay.
[293:59.57]What in here?
[294:00.31]No.
[294:04.23]What exit?
[294:06.94]You locking me in?
[294:09.28]They're locking me in.
[294:13.32]Well, fine.
[294:13.74]I'll just go down the sewer.
[294:19.53]I'm your favorite centipede streamer.
[294:30.19]Okay.
[294:30.45]Down we go.
[295:05.24]Okay.
[295:05.84]I did that on purpose because I took a lot of damage for no reason.
[295:18.43]Oof.
[295:18.71]That was pretty...
[295:34.71]Sorry about that.
[295:35.53]Alright.
[295:45.60]Oh, shit.
[295:45.99]He's coming down here.
[295:52.57]Goodbye.
[296:09.08]What was that?
[296:11.46]Alright.
[296:11.72]There's the little shortcut to get out of here.
[296:14.06]Up and under.
[296:17.69]Let's go.
[296:18.21]Alright.
[296:35.20]There's traps everywhere.
[296:37.26]Just activate them.
[296:40.94]Shit.
[296:41.44]I may have fucked that up.
[296:42.72]It's alright.
[296:46.93]Well, whatever.
[296:47.47]I'm just going to walk this way anyways.
[297:01.94]You check it out.
[297:02.86]I don't want to go over there.
[297:14.50]Couple of dopes.
[297:26.40]Someone needs to make a fire extinguisher smash super cut.
[297:32.46]It's just available for me, so I do it.
[297:42.30]Alright, and then turn this.
[297:43.40]Now, I'm not exactly sure what that did, but it did something, so let's go up.
[297:58.31]It's just a... It's just a thing that I know.
[298:00.99]You know what I mean?
[298:02.35]It's routine.
[298:04.61]In a game with scary jump scares and all kinds of weird fucked up enemies, this is routine for me.
[298:10.47]It's comfortable.
[298:18.00]Okay, I can't go anywhere.
[298:35.70]Does it kill me?
[298:41.94]Nope.
[298:43.24]As long as I don't fuck it up, I'll be fine.
[298:50.86]Here we go.
[298:53.14]Costco is garbage tier pizza.
[298:58.35]Why would you eat Costco pizza?
[299:04.25]Is it good?
[299:07.13]Because it's good.
[299:11.29]It's pizza tier list.
[299:12.53]It's good and cheap.
[299:15.91]I thought Costco is where you go buy like 40 tubes of toothpaste.
[299:32.91]No!
[299:33.39]Hey!
[299:34.22]I wanted to do that.
[299:37.02]Why is it on TV?
[299:40.82]That was so anticlimactic.
[299:56.24]He's just like, I just wanted to do what needs to be done.
[300:05.74]Come on.
[300:06.10]That guy can't get thrown into one of the silos or something.
[300:12.01]Yes, we're going to slide kick his corpse off.
[300:14.25]Don't worry.
[300:19.63]You'd think I'm not going to do that.
[300:25.78]Those things open every time.
[300:28.18]Those notebooks just go like that when you go near them.
[300:31.84]It's actually really strange.
[300:41.81]He's gonna be like, Hero!
[300:44.19]Come over here!
[300:46.63]There's one last thing I need to tell you, right?
[300:48.83]Why is he like happy?
[300:57.64]He locked you out the only way in is to divert power to the door Divert power to the vault door I can't you can't slide them off One last meal for you still hungry
[301:39.33]Why did I die from that?
[301:40.45]Alright, tell me again.
[301:47.58]Okay.
[302:09.84]I'll see if I can divert some power.
[302:14.10]You hang tight, guy that'll be dead when I get back lying down further on his back and not breathing.
[302:28.21]See?
[302:31.33]I'm gonna go down this way.
[302:50.74]What?
[302:54.30]How the fuck do you keep doing that so well?
[302:57.40]I'm gonna die.
[303:01.05]He's throwing another one.
[303:02.37]He's trying to throw another one.
[303:16.49]Turn off the flashlight.
[303:26.10]What is that?
[303:26.54]Oh, I guess it's got health.
[303:32.98]Okay.
[303:35.62]Here we go.
[303:38.04]I'm taking this out.
[303:38.96]This thing is... You fucker!
[304:02.84]Really?
[304:03.83]Alright, I need to start using the other gun.
[304:21.04]Did you drop one of these too?
[304:23.28]Didn't you?
[304:24.56]I guess not.
[304:25.10]Alright, this thing's gonna be used.
[304:27.58]Get the fire extinguishers.
[304:28.63]No, I'm over that, no.
[304:30.17]I don't do that anymore.
[304:40.20]Say right.
[304:49.00]Nice.
[304:50.66]Yeah, I'm open to that.
[304:51.41]I'm more into the Magic Notebooks opening, though.
[304:54.85]I wanna open those.
[304:55.59]Fucking... Fire Stickers are old news, guys.
[305:15.74]Do we have power?
[305:16.34]Is that what that means?
[305:19.10]We're connected?
[305:19.62]Do we have a signal?
[305:28.07]Maybe?
[305:28.33]I can't believe I used to do that shit.
[305:36.57]Embarrassing.
[305:58.12]Uh, let's just go check it.
[306:11.69]No, I thought that was... Damn it.
[306:14.81]Do I have to do both sides?
[306:16.23]I mean, that was a pretty elaborate thing that happened.
[306:23.15]Is it open?
[306:26.74]This does not look like it's open.
[306:29.56]It is not.
[306:30.54]I have to do them both.
[306:43.15]So, let's go this side.
[306:55.56]Wait, what is it?
[306:57.74]Did I go down here already?
[307:02.39]No, did I?
[307:03.45]Was I on this side?
[307:07.43]Yeah, I did this already.
[307:08.33]Are they connected?
[307:15.04]Is both sides the same thing?
[307:24.07]Do I have that right?
[307:25.53]Do I just have to do something else down there?
[307:27.57]Or do I have to actually go to the other side?
[307:29.09]And this is the side that I was on before.
[307:30.74]I just went the wrong way, yeah.
[307:33.26]That's what I'm figuring.
[307:45.57]Okay.
[307:47.25]So, theoretically now I'm on the other side.
[307:51.18]No, I'm not.
[307:53.32]Am I?
[307:53.64]Am I?
[307:54.52]I'm fucking confused.
[307:55.59]What the fuck am I doing?
[308:03.43]Okay, so... They are connected.
[308:13.74]They are connected.
[308:15.28]So... I have to go back down to where I was before.
[308:25.23]Because that device was down there.
[308:30.27]So... It's not about two different sides.
[308:34.56]It's just going back down there and pressing more buttons.
[308:42.23]Because I went right last time.
[308:44.31]Okay, yeah.
[308:45.59]I thought I had to go on the other side and there was another one of these.
[308:59.66]Alright, this is double yellow.
[309:06.98]We have both yellow switches in.
[309:12.39]Whatever the... Whatever that means.
[309:22.89]So now...
[309:28.21]Is that enough?
[309:29.37]Does that open another door to do the blue ones now?
[309:31.67]I don't know.
[309:35.42]Or is that just power?
[309:44.78]Well.
[309:46.28]This door is the two yellow.
[309:47.52]Now I gotta find the two blue.
[309:48.84]Alright.
[309:49.32]That's what you gotta do.
[310:18.90]Alright.
[310:21.76]Is he alive?
[310:26.85]Anybody else alive up here?
[310:29.97]I don't believe so.
[310:32.35]Oh, no.
[310:33.17]You're dead.
[310:35.03]Just making sure you're actually dead.
[310:36.79]What does that say?
[310:43.76]Caution.
[310:44.16]No.
[310:44.54]No.
[310:53.10]This guy used to be my favorite fire extinguisher smasher.
[310:57.22]Okay.
[310:57.64]Sure, whatever you say.
[311:01.91]Let's get up there if I can.
[311:22.24]So I need to get up there, but... What's that?
[311:28.72]Secret?
[311:30.91]Is it great right there?
[311:35.47]Nice.
[311:35.79]I didn't even know there was a magic notebook up there.
[311:38.65]Fucking sick.
[311:47.92]He's over this game?
[311:49.36]No, no.
[311:50.68]I'm not.
[311:51.04]I really am not.
[311:52.62]I'm just a little drained.
[311:56.26]But that has nothing to do with the game.
[311:58.06]It has to do with me.
[312:04.84]Every fucking time.
[312:06.22]It's awesome.
[312:10.50]There's other magic books?
[312:16.59]Alright, so now, this is too yellow, so I can open it.
[312:20.58]Nice.
[312:22.30]Hey, look at me, I'm up here.
[312:30.38]I hear something.
[312:32.68]Finally, I have two health- I haven't had two health packs in probably an- What is in the wall?
[312:48.46]Alright.
[312:49.28]Long range.
[312:49.78]Think I can get it?
[312:55.89]No.
[312:56.53]Not like it matters.
[312:58.99]Somebody threw a grenade.
[313:01.03]And it hit me right in the head.
[313:04.71]I'm stuck in the... I'm stuck right now.
[313:09.80]I don't like that outcome.
[313:24.27]Yeah, fucking the- the grenades.
[313:47.88]The grenades.
[313:51.58]I got double tapped.
[313:54.03]I'm just going in.
[313:55.41]Fuck it!
[313:59.46]Out of my way!
[314:36.21]What does he have for a weapon?
[314:42.70]Nah, I don't want the outcome here.
[314:43.94]Alright, let's go.
[314:45.64]I'm actually done fucking around.
[315:33.48]Okay.
[315:35.64]That was fun.
[315:37.88]Where's the guy with the rocket launcher?
[315:44.48]I had to get serious there for a second even though I took two health packs.
[315:54.03]The streamer dies to grenade and goes bald.
[316:00.27]One of these days... Here's the real... Listen, this is important.
[316:05.30]One of these days... You know, let's say I stream for, like, another... Let's say I keep streaming for, like, another five to ten years.
[316:11.62]Right?
[316:12.92]There's going to be a scenario where I'm going to actually be truly bald.
[316:17.51]Like an M on the top of my head, back here.
[316:22.11]And you guys are gonna have so much fun.
[316:25.95]Why won't this...
[316:33.27]Isn't that too yellow?
[316:48.73]I'm gonna go up.
[316:55.05]Can I even go up anymore?
[316:56.29]Am I just... I'm confused.
[317:09.68]glitch it out and get up there.
[317:13.07]No.
[317:16.23]Because this door doesn't open.
[317:17.09]Can I get up here?
[317:25.68]So why can't I get this door open?
[317:31.82]Is there a problem with this?
[317:32.96]Why can't I open the toilet room?
[317:41.69]I don't know.
[317:43.03]But that means I have to go back through... Where the fuck do I go?
[318:00.08]Here we go.
[318:07.84]No one tell him.
[318:12.40]What?
[318:12.56]We're getting no one to tell him.
[318:17.42]Alright, is this blue?
[318:24.89]Blue, blue.
[318:36.21]She's not in there.
[318:41.53]She's not, like, lying on the ground, right?
[318:48.23]Okay, blue is not ready.
[318:55.64]Where is it?
[319:02.92]Wait, wait, wait.
[319:03.70]What's going on there?
[319:12.20]What, is this in the way?
[319:12.96]What do you mean?
[319:19.14]Well, fucking get rid of it!
[319:39.30]Okay.
[319:41.18]There we go.
[319:41.96]We got data to upload.
[319:43.28]Get it uploaded.
[319:45.11]Get over here.
[320:11.07]Alright, that's it.
[320:12.17]Now plug the damn thing in.
[320:21.25]Be on shoulder.
[320:25.68]Will you guys relax?
[320:36.72]And then I gotta go through that door.
[320:41.25]Blue, blue, right?
[320:42.34]There it is.
[320:48.68]Cool.
[320:50.20]Let's go.
[320:52.56]Now I need red.
[320:53.14]Come here.
[320:57.19]Give me that.
[320:58.71]Red and red.
[321:00.43]And that's it.
[321:09.50]You have bees all over your skin.
[321:10.96]Oh shit.
[321:12.14]I should probably go to the doctor.
[321:23.95]Cool.
[321:24.37]Alright.
[321:25.60]So that leads me to now I need to go back to the door that I just was at because that won't open.
[321:33.74]But now it should open now.
[321:37.83]I wonder if my hypothesis is going to be correct.
[321:53.66]It is.
[321:53.98]Okay, well...
[322:12.10]Oh my lord.
[322:21.62]Hey, hey!
[322:29.43]Why is it... Why is it... Get this dust out of here!
[322:39.21]Whoa!
[322:48.09]Alright, I've had enough of this.
[322:50.19]I hate these things.
[322:52.01]How the fuck are you alive if you're supposed to kill these things without them arcade machining you?
[323:00.01]Oh, like that.
[323:00.69]Okay, nice.
[323:01.85]These things aren't even that bad.
[323:03.09]They're fine.
[323:03.45]I remember when I thought that was fun.
[323:20.99]Memories.
[323:21.37]It's like looking at an old photo.
[323:45.64]No item.
[323:46.02]Where are the items?
[323:55.78]That's new.
[323:57.86]What's in there?
[324:00.18]Who knows?
[324:01.76]We'll never know.
[324:04.15]Till I go this way!
[324:06.31]Hold on.
[324:10.01]I'll take that heal, please.
[324:11.93]Thank you.
[324:19.33]Pretzel Jerma?
[324:21.45]What do you mean?
[324:22.05]Pretzel?
[324:22.69]Pretzel?
[324:36.89]Is the rocket launcher... I don't think I want it.
[324:40.82]No, fuck that thing.
[324:42.04]Okay.
[324:43.92]So what is this for?
[324:45.60]Something to do with this.
[324:47.22]What do I need to do with this thing?
[324:51.38]I tried shooting it.
[324:53.76]There's something else here.
[324:55.48]Grab... I could put some barrels in here.
[325:00.63]Shoot the ones that explode.
[325:10.85]Get inside.
[325:11.67]Okay.
[325:14.93]Get inside.
[325:15.63]That's a little odd, but whatever.
[325:26.70]I hear those stupid robots.
[325:40.69]They're in the ceiling.
[325:42.13]Do I go in?
[325:53.62]Maybe I should go in.
[326:00.35]Alright, I need to get up there.
[326:04.33]Can I just walk over there?
[326:09.35]I sure can.
[326:10.07]I was trying to get superpowers.
[326:29.92]Alright, we're good.
[326:33.04]No, I shouldn't... I didn't mean to do that.
[326:36.22]I wanted to get a good view.
[326:39.95]This door's gonna open.
[326:46.92]They're all done.
[326:53.78]I win.
[326:57.40]I created this- I finished- You want superpowers, dude?
[327:08.18]I can try to get you some.
[327:22.04]Not today.
[327:26.14]Not today.
[327:27.22]Almost still in there.
[327:39.74]She has to be.
[327:41.84]Alright.
[327:43.28]I'm gonna do my best.
[327:50.73]I just have to go through the door now.
[328:01.86]These people aren't even real.
[328:24.40]Hey.
[328:24.62]No, no.
[328:24.88]There are four pylons.
[328:25.82]Damage the reactor.
[328:56.55]What about you?
[328:58.31]What are you gonna do?
[329:11.98]I guess he's just gonna die there, yeah.
[329:13.66]Okay.
[329:13.80]Let's go.
[329:16.22]Well, he doesn't have the super shotgun
[329:27.27]What does he have?
[329:28.71]Mustache and a big brain.
[329:34.84]Good luck.
[329:38.53]You take walls down with this thing.
[329:55.91]Alright, well, what about... Here we go.
[330:06.24]Alright, I'm gonna save this.
[330:10.56]I'm gonna use the default shotgun.
[330:11.67]It's my bread and butter.
[330:13.73]You guys
[330:22.13]I'm not this shit again.
[330:23.01]It's the Joker.
[330:24.11]It's the Joker.
[330:25.03]I don't know.
[330:26.51]Where was I born?
[330:54.92]And I were born from the same mother.
[331:02.69]Can you tell me the story without me having to shoot ghosts?
[331:05.09]You must have sensed it.
[331:06.53]Like, just tell me.
[331:07.37]She cannot see in your mind, but perhaps you can see into hers.
[331:10.99]A life of waking from one nightmare, only to find herself in another.
[331:28.58]Damn it.
[331:29.86]Can we rain check?
[331:31.26]I don't have any grenades.
[331:46.86]What?
[332:00.24]But what happened?
[332:05.28]This soldier's just been watching, just... Oh, shit.
[332:10.80]That's the real time to say that, is right now.
[332:52.88]I just fucking hurt myself.
[332:53.92]I thought this was a dream.
[333:06.74]What do I have on weapons?
[333:09.76]Just this, okay.
[333:17.80]She was a very disturbed child.
[333:19.88]Terrible, debilitating nightmares, hallucinations, hysteria.
[333:24.75]She never had a chance at a normal life.
[333:27.31]It was Dissler who realized she was telepathic.
[333:30.39]He speculated that she was extremely sensitive to the negative emotions of people around her.
[333:39.82]Shit.
[334:14.04]It's fucked up.
[334:28.61]You probably shouldn't shoot the volatile ball of destructive gas.
[334:32.11]Hey!
[334:32.41]Hey, open up!
[334:45.09]It's me!
[334:46.63]Actually, it'd be more like this.
[334:51.88]It'd be like... He can't hear me.
[335:05.43]Oh no!
[335:14.90]Get away from me!
[335:15.84]Get away from me!
[335:39.45]I do appreciate the golem run.
[335:44.19]Has to be in every horror movie.
[336:02.10]What's that?
[336:03.24]Is that smoke over here?
[336:16.26]What did I just do?
[336:19.63]Uh... Who opened up the portal the hell?
[336:28.37]I took a lot of damage there.
[336:34.33]You did.
[336:35.39]YOU did this.
[337:03.17]Just lying around.
[337:03.99]Let's use the pistol for the first time ever.
[337:08.75]Yeah, I'll use the pistol.
[337:13.27]It's like kind of fun to shoot.
[337:16.08]It's only taken me until the last 20 minutes of the game to realize it's a fun weapon.
[337:21.45]It's not as good as the super shotgun.
[337:22.81]Should we go this way?
[337:38.99]Nope.
[337:47.42]Escape and destroy... Expose and destroy reactor cells to sabotage energy pylons.
[338:05.62]Okay.
[338:12.20]Hey, that doesn't... that doesn't cause damage.
[338:27.07]Shoot all the yellow spots.
[338:40.90]Am I getting in close?
[339:07.59]Did I do it?
[339:11.01]Okay, go!
[339:11.53]Uh-oh.
[339:22.93]What the hell?!
[339:23.59]I'm almost dead!
[339:55.86]Give me a health pack.
[339:57.90]Give me a health pack right here.
[339:59.26]Uh-oh.
[340:16.73]Uh-oh.
[340:17.97]That way.
[340:18.61]That way.
[340:19.41]That way.
[340:19.75]That way.
[340:20.03]That way.
[340:35.64]Let's go!
[340:35.98]They're gonna get in, right?
[340:48.22]They're gonna get in here.
[341:03.12]He's alive.
[341:03.56]I just picked up his signal.
[341:05.28]If you can hear me, get to high ground.
[341:07.20]A chopper is standing by.
[341:10.14]Hey!
[341:11.40]How are you guys?
[341:13.01]Alright!
[341:14.83]How's everybody doing?
[341:16.51]I've had quite a day.
[341:19.51]Who just gave a hundred dollars?
[341:22.00]Freddy Dredd just gave 10,750 bits.
[341:26.93]Jerma, I'm scared.
[341:28.69]Well, thank you for your more than $100.
[341:30.93]An insane amount of bits.
[341:41.41]Motherfucker.
[341:46.31]Hey!
[341:47.73]Duck?
[341:48.81]Go around it.
[341:51.11]Come on, that's a child.
[341:52.01]That's a...
[342:02.31]Let's go.
[342:02.71]Get me out.
[342:10.42]Alright, where are they coming from?
[342:11.84]All surrounded.
[342:13.28]All... Oh, fuck.
[342:24.78]Oh, fuck.
[342:25.12]Where are they going?
[342:25.92]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[342:34.34]Get away from me.
[342:37.37]Where am I?
[342:37.89]Did I do it?
[342:40.31]Okay.
[342:40.57]I'm going.
[342:43.29]Oh, shit.
[342:44.83]Oh, shit.
[342:45.65]Oh, my God.
[342:46.17]They're everywhere.
[342:46.79]Did I miss the health pack?
[342:58.18]Fucking dumb person.
[343:01.04]Just jumped back down.
[343:04.16]No, I'm fine.
[343:04.80]Okay, go.
[343:11.22]Don't break it.
[343:11.68]Almost out of bullets.
[343:25.13]Almost out of bullets.
[343:26.11]And then I have to use the shotgun?
[343:27.07]That hurts me.
[343:29.19]Nope.
[343:29.87]I'm gonna...
[343:34.30]No.
[343:37.95]I didn't want to have a temper tantrum.
[343:39.17]Like, where is it?
[343:42.75]I've been able to do this the whole game?
[343:44.37]I've been able to punch the whole game.
[343:48.53]No.
[343:55.80]Oh, but there's so much fun things I could have done.
[343:58.08]Where's the gun?
[344:03.82]happened to the gun there's like two guns that I want the other one why I don't even know where it is it exploded and flew away that's great okay whatever I'm just gonna put this on for now it's on the ground yeah I'd put that's over here
[344:32.54]Doesn't hurt, right?
[344:50.01]Oh no, there's a lot of weapons here.
[345:16.73]Close the portals.
[345:29.64]This gun is too good, but I can't get close with it.
[345:41.69]I almost just fell through that.
[345:43.47]You've got to be kidding me.
[345:49.49]Oh.
[345:50.97]I'm supposed to fall through that.
[345:58.41]Let's go back to the, no, the machine gun.
[346:02.98]Oh my god, what are these?
[346:05.32]Like, they jump now.
[346:10.12]Oh, this is a way scarier game than the last seven to eight straight hours of this game.
[346:35.08]I've tried to forget.
[346:36.31]I've tried so hard to forget.
[347:19.44]Place.
[347:22.06]This place.
[347:24.05]That's me.
[347:25.53]That's me.
[347:27.35]Making those noises.
[348:00.70]Give me back my baby!
[348:05.80]You will be a god among men.
[348:07.74]Take her back to the bath.
[348:18.07]No!
[348:18.45]My baby.
[348:39.89]Okay.
[348:41.91]Let's leave.
[348:46.81]My baby.
[348:58.37]What a brick.
[348:59.80]Did I do it?
[349:08.93]That doesn't seem right.
[349:16.08]That's not right.
[349:17.22]That's incorrect.
[349:19.26]That doesn't seem like the right.
[349:20.60]Can I get back in the room?
[349:23.52]Go back in this room.
[349:26.06]Go quick.
[349:26.90]Go get in the bathtub.
[349:28.64]Go get in the bathtub.
[349:30.28]That's what you're supposed to do.
[349:31.22]Go get in the bathtub.
[349:40.80]I think I'm dead.
[349:47.58]There he is!
[350:17.19]Holy shit!
[350:17.73]Did I just throw a grenade?
[350:19.76]I just, like, threw a grenade.
[350:22.26]What?
[350:22.38]How is that an epilogue?
[350:24.04]Epilogue?
[350:24.28]We just...
[350:48.72]We just watched a mushroom cloud and then the ring lady went into the helicopter.
[350:57.66]It's gotta set us up for fear too.
[351:06.03]The helicopter you're on got attacked again.
[351:08.97]Attacked again.
[351:09.95]Yeah.
[351:16.69]How long are the expansions?
[351:22.20]Are they a couple hours each, or how do they play out?
[351:28.62]Four hours?
[351:29.64]That's not bad.
[351:31.84]Well, so here's what we're going to do for the next few days.
[351:37.52]I am not going to be streaming tomorrow, but we are going to go... Stop falling over.
[351:45.62]We are going to do... I originally was going to do today, yesterday, and then Saturday, Sunday.
[351:51.06]But we're going to do Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[351:57.82]So we'll, instead of doing four days, we'll do like five of the last six days.
[352:05.81]And what's on the list... There are a few things, actually.
[352:09.95]There's rhythm games, which I'm probably going to break up the horror stuff.
[352:15.44]But we are eventually going to make our way to this.
[352:18.96]This is Siren for the PlayStation 2.
[352:28.62]And... And... The last of the, probably, the horror games that I'm going to put at least some significant time in is this one.
[352:44.95]We've got some interesting stuff, for sure.
[352:51.01]The Thing and Siren are probably how we're gonna round out.
[352:53.09]And then the Halloween stream.
[352:55.93]Now that's a... Yeah, I've heard... I've never played this.
[353:03.32]That game is hard as sin.
[353:04.88]Well, it's alright.
[353:07.06]You guys can help me.
[353:09.16]You guys can help me out in these ones, so don't worry.
[353:13.12]But I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[353:15.44]I'm just gonna try to gain some energy.
[353:19.37]And hopefully by the end of this week, I'll be a little bit more used to me having to use this medication.
[353:28.97]Because I'm really only gonna be on it for another probably four or five days.
[353:34.25]So.
[353:36.32]Do less cocaine.
[353:38.92]Yes.
[353:39.50]And by less, you mean zero.
[353:41.36]And by zero, you mean never.
[353:47.59]Yeah, I'm really going to start doing less cocaine over the next few weeks.
[353:53.53]Jesus Christ.
[354:05.78]Jeremy strikes me as an E guy.
[354:08.52]No, Jeremy should strike you as a guy that likes salad and bananas.
[354:12.53]He likes eating salads and bananas.
[354:14.63]And sometimes he has like Captain Crunch sometimes.
[354:20.71]what I like I don't do drugs that's what I'm saying I don't do drugs I don't do drugs I don't do drugs that's not true I'm on them right now
[354:45.27]Oh!
[354:46.67]I mean, like, prescription.
[354:49.21]For a prescription!
[354:51.70]Hey, thanks for watching, everybody.
[355:04.47]I'll see you on the next one.
[355:07.95]Not tomorrow, but the next day, and the next day, and then we'll do three days in a row after tomorrow.
[355:13.89]I'm going to spend most of tomorrow just trying to energize again.
[355:19.40]I've just been so tired.
[355:23.18]It's definitely this medicine is making me so fucking exhausted.
[355:26.10]I don't even know why I shouldn't.
[355:30.36]I just broke all my bones.
[355:35.42]But you do what you got to do, right?
[355:40.74]Somebody just wrote good.
[355:43.99]What's wrong with some of you guys?
[355:47.39]Why?
[355:47.67]Alright.
[355:50.49]I'll see you guys on today.
[355:53.55]Hold on.
[355:54.01]Let me look at the actual what I want to do.
[355:55.74]Yeah.
[355:56.04]So Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[356:01.00]Yeah.
[356:01.70]That sounds good to me.
[356:03.78]And then I got to hold on.
[356:05.94]I got to really plan this out because if I do Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[356:12.86]And then maybe... Because the Halloween stream is going to take a few days to set up.
[356:21.86]So no, there'll be plenty of time to do, at least.
[356:24.50]Because before the Halloween stream, I'll be live how many more times?
[356:30.33]see one two three we get some rhythm games done and then maybe like one or two or one day there two days off there and then like one two three four yeah there's definitely plenty of time to do at least one alright let me ask you then so I can plan this what would you rather see over the course of a couple of streams the thing or siren because
[356:54.28]There's only really one of them that I could do and get it done.
[356:57.30]I would assume.
[356:58.99]I'm going to do a straw poll right now with the still people here.
[357:07.97]If I can do them both, I will.
[357:09.91]If I can make that happen, but I'm pretty sure both these games are at least 12 to 15 plus hours long.
[357:19.34]And look, if it's not interesting, I can, you know, I can move on.
[357:28.94]They both are going to be interesting.
[357:31.80]Just because, you know, I did a little bit of research to see.
[357:37.13]What's the thing?
[357:37.75]The thing is the sequel to the movie.
[357:43.45]It's actually, I believe it is actual canon.
[357:46.39]This is like what they did for a sequel.
[357:50.49]The thing is a sequel to the actual The Thing movie.
[358:00.36]And this is still very close.
[358:05.38]Yeah, you have like a squad in this game, and you have to control everybody's emotions.
[358:10.90]People sometimes don't trust you, they think that you're the thing instead.
[358:14.09]It just seems like a fun experience, at least for a couple of streams.
[358:26.31]And Siren, from my understanding, is a game where you control multiple protagonists.
[358:33.97]You choose a protagonist that you want to play for that particular chapter or something, right?
[358:42.52]They both seem pretty interesting.
[358:46.29]and siren siren is going to be probably much scarier than the thing the thing is going to be more third person creepy gross action game whereas siren is I believe an actual horror scary game but uh I'm I'm gonna call this here in a second if you have not decided if you're not picked I suggest you do because it is very close
[359:18.06]They're both horror games.
[359:20.04]They both are technically horror games.
[359:23.66]But I think Siren is just a scarier game, and The Thing is more action-y.
[359:31.83]The Thing is probably more like Fear was.
[359:46.57]Alright.
[359:48.09]Can you re-vote?
[359:49.13]What do you mean, re-vote?
[359:55.44]Re-vote?
[360:03.06]You didn't know what the games were.
[360:06.94]Wait, so if you didn't know what they were, why did you pick one?
[360:12.00]I said, what would you rather see me play?
[360:13.91]This or this?
[360:14.61]And it's like, ah, this one!
[360:15.73]But it's like, alright, well... Shut up, just let me re-vote.
[360:29.84]They're both very good, apparently, so don't worry.
[360:32.32]And I'm gonna play... I didn't get them to not play them.
[360:35.64]I just, which one would you, which one would you rather see first?
[360:41.57]Alright.
[360:43.17]Alright, that's it.
[360:44.07]That's it.
[360:44.45]We're doing the thing.
[360:50.27]That's the one.
[360:59.90]We're going to be doing the thing.
[361:03.38]And the siren will happen probably immediately after it.
[361:10.75]Let me change my vote.
[361:12.83]Mad face.
[361:14.53]No, you'll see them both.
[361:15.67]Don't worry.
[361:20.74]What is this?
[361:21.16]Oh, right.
[361:25.24]I love this game.
[361:26.08]Alright.
[361:26.86]My final thoughts on the origin of the fear.
[361:30.32]No, not the fear.
[361:31.03]It's not the thing.
[361:31.85]It's not the fear.
[361:33.01]On fear.
[361:35.33]That was very good.
[361:38.39]It was just fun.
[361:40.53]And that's all you want out of a video game.
[361:44.13]It was just fun.
[361:46.09]It got a little repetitive in a couple places, but it was still fun.
[361:50.69]I still liked it.
[361:53.77]Good stuff.
[361:56.07]Alright, let's do the... Let's do the bits.
[362:01.89]Have them open here from earlier.
[362:07.74]And if you take it off, we'll see you again this weekend.
[362:12.62]For a Saturday, Sunday, and then Monday extravaganza, three days in a row, we'll do.
[362:18.71]I thought, no, it was great.
[362:28.55]I loved nearly every second of playing Fear.
[362:33.20]It was great.
[362:34.96]And the oh shit stuff is going to be stuck there forever in my brain.
[362:40.95]Alright, we'll see you on Saturday if you're leaving.
[362:44.07]Thanks for joining us.
[362:45.39]And for the rest of you.
[362:48.51]We've got a few things to talk about.
[362:49.87]We've got some bits to do.
[362:52.15]Let's go back to earlier today.
[363:03.00]We had 300 bits from Co-Ray, who says, Hello, Mr. Streamer.
[363:07.44]Hope you're feeling good today.
[363:09.50]It's cool you're doing EU-friendly streams now.
[363:11.58]Also, do you think you'll play Planet Zoo when it comes out?
[363:15.28]Absolutely.
[363:17.14]I just didn't want to play the beta because I wanted to do the complete game.
[363:19.88]I didn't want to be limited by anything.
[363:22.27]And that's not... Hold on.
[363:24.41]This top sub gifter thing is just all fucked up.
[363:26.57]Let me change it.
[363:29.11]Okay, here we go.
[363:29.61]Let's try it again.
[363:31.33]If it's still me.
[363:32.57]Alright, if this is still me, I'm going to uninstall Streamlabs OBS.
[363:38.43]Alright, it's gone.
[363:47.26]Okay, it's gone.
[363:52.94]Alright, but anyways.
[363:54.67]Yeah, Planet Zoo, I just... I limit it in the sense that it's not like, oh, I'm so good at these games, and I'm so talented and so creative with all of my... I look at my habitats, I... No.
[364:06.73]But I just want all the animals.
[364:08.75]I just want access to everything.
[364:15.78]And that's coming out soon, isn't it?
[364:23.94]What are the rhythm games going to be?
[364:24.98]They've got Parappa the Rapper, Parappa the Rapper 2, I'm Jammer Lammy, Busta Groove, Guitar-O-Man, and... What's the other one?
[364:35.78]There's like one more.
[364:36.40]There's at least one more that I have.
[364:44.68]Yeah, all great games.
[364:45.68]Yeah.
[364:46.36]Guitar-O-Man is god tier.
[364:47.88]Oh, yeah.
[364:49.30]And guess what?
[364:51.84]I've never played it.
[364:53.95]I saw it in stores.
[364:55.39]I've seen people play it.
[364:57.03]I've never held the controller in my hand and played Guitaroman.
[365:00.22]So it's gonna be blind.
[365:03.73]Mm-hmm.
[365:07.19]Can't wait.
[365:09.71]But yeah, I've dialed the streams back a couple hours just because I know that living in Pacific daylight time still, whatever it is, streams get late for everybody.
[365:20.19]So I don't want to start at like four o'clock anymore.
[365:22.24]Starting around one or two is much better for everybody, me included.
[365:27.00]So yeah, I'm happy that people think it's a good start.
[365:31.10]SadVega, thanks for the $2.50.
[365:34.15]But here's the thing.
[366:05.22]No, I have no excuse.
[366:06.00]You're right.
[366:06.76]It's not nice.
[366:07.84]You're right.
[366:08.86]But it's everybody.
[366:11.56]It's everyone.
[366:14.94]It's not just me.
[366:16.68]When I brought that up, I think 3,000 people all said that they do the same thing.
[366:23.74]So it's an us problem.
[366:24.76]You know?
[366:29.03]Until we find out a way to have voicemails be... You know what?
[366:33.41]Voicemails will be gone in 10 years anyways, doesn't matter.
[366:37.18]You'll be able to get a text message and it'll just be read in your brain.
[366:40.82]You'll get like TTS text messages.
[366:43.48]You can just turn them on.
[366:45.36]So yeah, the voicemails will won't exist in like another probably 10, 20 years.
[366:50.60]So your job will get way easier.
[366:55.34]Hey, justasadboy, thanks for the 300 bits.
[367:00.76]Okay, thanks.
[367:01.16]I'm of the opinion that you should never take trading advice from anyone.
[367:31.40]Because everybody's guessing.
[367:35.71]You just have to try to use your best judgment on what you think if you're gonna just kind of play around with like a little bit of money and don't ever use
[367:44.67]that much money when you play when you like trade is not don't do that if you want to have like a little robin hood account or something where you mess around with like 30 40 50 bucks or something but don't don't like oh right right I guess I'll buy 10 grand worth of uh apple and then it's just it's gonna maybe it'll go up tomorrow uh but
[368:12.68]If anyone ever tells you... Let me tell you something.
[368:14.80]I got so many... Let me tell you.
[368:16.18]I know everything about the stock market.
[368:17.83]I got this.
[368:18.29]I got that.
[368:19.05]I got this chart.
[368:19.85]I've got this.
[368:20.21]Let me tell you.
[368:21.11]You've got to buy this one.
[368:24.83]No.
[368:25.01]Just eat a banana.
[368:33.00]He's talking to his past self.
[368:42.38]eat banana stalks.
[368:47.46]And maybe you'll calm down.
[368:49.34]And maybe you'll get the right amount of potassium.
[368:53.16]I don't think you guys realize just how many problems are solvable with a banana.
[369:00.85]Just by consuming a banana.
[369:05.27]It is the world's most versatile fruit.
[369:08.51]It does everything.
[369:18.97]He's saying invest in... No, I'm not saying to invest in, but no.
[369:22.85]Why would you do that?
[369:26.37]O... W... O... Why did I read that?
[369:32.76]I hate bananas?
[369:34.12]I used to, too.
[369:35.94]I did.
[369:40.94]I don't know why I read that, but... No, here's the one thing that you need, that I've realized over the last five to ten years.
[369:51.81]You can't... You can't tell people what to do with their money.
[369:58.65]Because then you almost become responsible for if something goes wrong.
[370:03.85]You know what I mean?
[370:04.39]Let's just say, for instance... And I'm gonna put a huge, gigantic asterisk on here.
[370:11.24]This is a joke scenario.
[370:13.48]This is not real.
[370:15.44]And the following sentences are fabricated.
[370:22.55]If I told you to go right now... Hey, y'all!
[370:25.59]Yeah, I got some tips for you.
[370:27.35]Yeah, open up, um... Yeah, you really should get into... I mean, honestly, seriously, like, Whole Foods is starting to really take off.
[370:35.51]Amazon, like, you really probably should start to buy a little bit of the Amazon stock.
[370:38.87]So, uh, once, like, the big Whole Foods earnings call happens, uh, it'll go up, uh, maybe for probably, like, 5-10%.
[370:44.42]Sell it on the next day.
[370:47.20]If that doesn't happen, I... I've just made an enemy.
[370:57.19]You know, if that doesn't happen, I did that.
[371:02.93]So I will never tell anybody what they should buy, investment-wise.
[371:11.32]Except, you know, if you were... Let me be talking about Bitcoin.
[371:19.33]But I still wouldn't.
[371:30.11]Bitcoin.
[371:32.43]Invest in Baltcoin.
[371:33.57]No, I... But long story short, yeah, I can't... I don't want to tell you what to do with your investments.
[371:41.73]Just do your research.
[371:43.87]If you think a company is worth investing in, really look into it and see what their plans are in the future.
[371:50.05]See what you think they're going to do and if you think it's worth it.
[371:54.26]Don't let anybody else try to tell you that unless this person...
[371:58.84]no you just can't you can't if you have a financial advisor then you have a stock portfolio then yeah then trust what that person does because you're you're that's your financial advisor not the guy on the subway you understand anyways
[372:26.88]Where we are here?
[372:27.60]Thank you, Fitty, for the 500 bits.
[372:29.84]You're the best.
[372:30.84]You're honestly the fucking best, Jerma.
[372:32.20]Thank you for being you.
[372:33.06]Can I get some jermaHearts in the chat?
[372:34.54]Well, thank you.
[372:35.00]That's incredibly kind of you.
[372:41.84]Thank you, Fitty.
[372:45.52]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[372:46.26]Thank you.
[372:51.84]Well, congratulations on getting your first job.
[372:53.16]Hopefully you'll learn some stuff.
[372:54.16]Hopefully make some money.
[373:23.48]And, yeah, I mean, depending on what you do, if, um, maybe they will just let you just kind of hang out with, like, some earpods in or whatever.
[373:35.33]But if not, then whenever you decide to show up, if you feel like coming out and hanging out here, yeah.
[373:43.16]Oh, you want to watch the VODs?
[373:44.08]There's a lot of people that do that too, so.
[373:47.60]Thank you for watching for as long as you have.
[373:52.37]And make sure you do your work, though.
[373:54.73]Like, you know, I scream a lot on this stream.
[373:58.75]You're talking about stacking boxes?
[374:00.03]I don't want you to have, like, a 50-pound box in your hand, and I scream something, and you, like, drop it.
[374:05.06]I don't want you to get, like, hurt.
[374:13.61]But thank you.
[374:14.37]Congratulations on the job.
[374:17.03]Stefunkey checking next to the 300 bits for all the new viewers in chat.
[374:19.50]Don't worry, Jerma has an inside joke where he acts really stupid and doesn't understand something.
[374:23.36]Yeah, I know, right.
[374:26.46]All the new viewers, they'll figure it out.
[374:28.22]You know, it's just like a funny... It's a yellow belt moment where we just... Where am I?
[374:34.34]Where the fuck am I?
[374:36.02]Is this another hallway?
[374:37.14]I'm in a circle?
[374:38.36]Fuck!
[374:41.27]And everybody laughs wicked hard.
[374:43.47]And then I look in the camera and I go... And I wink.
[374:56.48]And then the stream turns off and I lie in bed and I look at the ceiling and I go, how the fuck did I walk in a circle seven fucking times?
[375:20.29]And I squeeze my eyes real tight to try to block out the memory.
[375:25.41]I'm just like... Blink!
[375:29.81]Alright, it's gone.
[375:36.04]He's crying.
[375:46.56]And then I take a nice bath.
[375:50.19]You like Ren from Ren and Stimpy?
[375:55.35]You know, I've always really connected with Ren.
[376:06.97]Do the voice.
[376:12.13]No, nobody can.
[376:13.51]There's one person that can do that voice and it's Billy West.
[376:15.57]No one else can.
[376:27.83]That reminds me, I need to go back and watch the old Ren and Stimpy's.
[376:33.45]They tried to bring it back and it was just a disaster.
[376:38.53]The original Ren and Stimpy is just so bizarre and interesting.
[376:51.14]Billy West is in the chat?
[376:52.38]Holy f- Are you serious?
[376:58.26]What's up?
[376:59.30]I'm a huge fan.
[377:02.14]I'm a huge fan.
[377:02.86]PogChamp.
[377:03.68]No, don't.
[377:04.38]I can't talk like that.
[377:05.58]Pog.
[377:06.02]No.
[377:07.46]What's up?
[377:07.88]Hey.
[377:08.60]I'm a big fan of yours.
[377:09.56]You're really, really cool.
[377:12.92]I loved you in Futurama and Doug.
[377:16.60]Pog.
[377:21.92]Thanks for coming.
[377:22.46]Thanks for coming to the stream.
[377:24.52]I appreciate everything you do.
[377:28.87]He left.
[377:35.89]I'll be alright.
[377:36.29]I'll get over it.
[377:36.81]I'll take a fucking banana.
[377:38.78]Bath.
[378:09.88]banana banana bath is when you have a banana flavored banana scented bath this is a cool outro yes it is
[378:31.57]No.
[378:32.85]Alright.
[378:33.15]I'm going to stop blinking.
[378:35.79]I'm going to blink.
[378:36.55]Yeah.
[378:37.27]Okay.
[378:37.81]I'm going to stop.
[378:39.25]Okay.
[378:39.59]We're good.
[378:42.81]So, thank you to CVFD for the thousand bits.
[378:51.87]Hey Jeremy, yesterday you said you had to drink some nasty medicine.
[378:54.86]Yes.
[378:55.92]That reminded me of the time I had to drink steroids for my leg.
[378:58.50]The stuff was disgusting.
[379:00.22]I lost my appetite for a few days, but I couldn't get over the taste out of my mouth.
[379:04.38]Yeah, it's kind of similar.
[379:10.83]Two times a day, morning and night, I have to drink this gross, thick, sugary liquid.
[379:19.71]It's disgusting.
[379:22.31]It is not appealing at all.
[379:25.63]It's just... The word is just vile.
[379:34.88]And it's kind of just like fucking me all up.
[379:40.76]Prescribed maple syrup.
[379:43.18]Yeah, weirdly.
[379:46.22]Dunkin Donuts coffee.
[379:54.01]But yeah, it's annoying, but, you know, like, you gotta do what you gotta do.
[380:01.30]Hold your nose while drinking it?
[380:02.46]That makes it worse for me.
[380:04.20]Because my brain dials up a thousand percent.
[380:08.64]You know what this tastes like.
[380:09.48]You know what that tastes like.
[380:10.33]You know what that tastes like.
[380:11.31]It's disgusting.
[380:11.71]You know what that tastes like.
[380:12.33]You know what this tastes like.
[380:13.11]And I'm just like, I know what it tastes like.
[380:14.99]I know, I know.
[380:15.55]Yeah, you do.
[380:15.97]Yeah, you do.
[380:16.79]You know what that tastes like.
[380:21.17]And it makes it worse.
[380:28.67]Especially because it's consistency, too.
[380:30.85]Uh-oh.
[380:33.03]I just have to do it.
[380:40.98]Get a turkey baster and shoot his tongue in your throat.
[380:44.48]No, it's too... Number one, it's very thick.
[380:46.62]And number two, I don't really want to gag and puke.
[380:53.30]I can't.
[380:53.78]Oh, I've got bananas.
[380:55.82]I can't.
[380:56.16]You know what I'm going to do?
[380:57.16]Listen to this shit.
[380:58.34]I'm about to blow your mind right now.
[380:59.80]Let me tell you something.
[381:00.58]Let me tell you a secret.
[381:02.60]Take six bananas.
[381:04.92]Chop them up.
[381:05.90]Peel them.
[381:06.22]Make sure they're ripe.
[381:07.92]Chop them up into little, you know, maybe half-inch circles.
[381:12.82]Put them in the freezer.
[381:13.42]A few hours later, when they're frozen, take them out.
[381:18.38]Put them into a blender.
[381:19.84]Blend them up.
[381:22.22]Smooth.
[381:24.85]Take them out of the blender now that they are banana ice cream.
[381:29.33]Scoop it up.
[381:30.87]Put it into a bowl.
[381:32.75]And eat it.
[381:36.12]If you want to add a little bit... Maybe, you know, sometimes if you want to get a little... A little fun with it.
[381:41.68]You can add like a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
[381:44.69]You could add a scoop of chocolate ice cream.
[381:47.05]You could add a little bit of your favorite other, like, strawberries.
[381:53.47]Maybe you could add, like, a couple of strawberries.
[381:55.87]Maybe some yogurt.
[381:57.01]Somebody just said, that sounds disgusting.
[381:58.87]It's really difficult for me not to ban you permanently from the channel.
[382:04.86]I mean, like, I'm hovering, and I've never done that before, but that's... It's close.
[382:13.24]Saved you.
[382:13.86]Okay.
[382:16.53]Just make banana bread.
[382:18.92]If you've never had it before, I would like you to not talk smack about it until you eat it.
[382:26.08]It is the most intensely delicious banana ice cream.
[382:30.42]And it's not even ice cream.
[382:35.45]It's so much better for you, too.
[382:40.71]Can you repeat the instructions?
[382:42.06]I wasn't listening.
[382:42.88]Well, that's unfortunate because you should have listened to the tutorial, Jerma.
[382:49.74]Why didn't you know that F was open door?
[382:57.77]Why weren't you paying attention, Jerma?
[383:03.53]He hates us.
[383:13.23]okay let's keep going we only got a little bit more to do but anyways uh six bananas chop chop chop chop chop make sure they're ripe freeze them take them out of the freezer when they're done about three to two to four some with three or four hours depending on your freezer I don't know how powerful it is you might have like a blast chiller I don't know that did I don't even have one of those
[383:36.40]Don't put it in there, uh, but if you- I don't know why I even brought that up.
[383:39.36]Three or four hours in the freezer, take them out, put them in the blender, blend it up until completely smooth, no chunky bullshit, wait till it's smooth, it might take a little while.
[383:48.29]Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if you feel like it, you don't have to, this is on you.
[383:52.25]Add a scoop of chocolate ice cream, if you feel like it, that's on you, not on me.
[383:55.81]Add- Whoa!
[383:58.23]Add two or three full tablespoons, like, of peanut butter.
[384:04.86]Blend it up.
[384:05.36]There you go.
[384:06.04]Done.
[384:10.88]That's your homework for the next day.
[384:13.66]I want all of you to have a banana.
[384:15.74]A whipped up frozen banana with maybe a little bit of peanut butter in it.
[384:20.87]Or a little bit of vanilla or chocolate ice cream.
[384:23.17]Or just straight up.
[384:25.41]And I want you to come back and I want to discuss that it's your homework.
[384:33.83]No, don't eat six bananas in one sitting.
[384:36.27]That's just to make enough to eat it a few times.
[384:42.25]I'm gonna make it, and I'm gonna show it to you on stream.
[384:44.15]And I want us all to show it at the same time.
[384:50.50]But, anyways.
[384:52.56]S10W update.
[384:53.68]Thank you, slow update for the 250.
[384:56.38]Hey, Jerma back again to wish you a happy Halloween.
[384:58.60]Unfortunately, last stream I caught was the Carnival.
[385:01.20]Which, by the way, is my favorite stream ever now.
[385:03.48]But I couldn't watch you because of work and stuff.
[385:05.78]But I'm happy to say I'm back to donating and supporting you.
[385:08.44]Peace and love.
[385:09.10]Peace and love.
[385:10.06]P.S.
[385:10.34]What's your favorite horror game?
[385:12.14]Just asking.
[385:13.53]Probably Outlast.
[385:17.31]Or Resident Evil 2.
[385:19.73]Or the first six hours of Resident Evil 7.
[385:24.99]Something like that.
[385:32.24]Resident Evil 4 didn't scare me as much as Resident Evil 2 did.
[385:39.88]Especially the remake.
[385:42.38]Hey, we're talking straight up scary?
[385:44.44]What's my favorite horror?
[385:46.60]There's a couple of criteria there.
[385:48.09]Yeah, Resident Evil's not that scary.
[385:54.95]There was a few times in Resident Evil the Regenerators were terrifying.
[386:00.61]The first few times you see them.
[386:04.51]In fact, I would put the Regenerators up as some of the scariest enemies I think I've played that were in a game.
[386:14.71]Number one, the number one scariest enemy, the most intensely terrifying enemy experience has to be Mr. X. It has to be at this point.
[386:30.04]It just was.
[386:33.27]Just the stress.
[386:37.18]And the... The walking around and the fact that... Because a lot of scenarios like that... It happens for a little bit and then you don't see them anymore.
[386:47.55]It doesn't happen anymore.
[386:50.95]It's a thing that happens for a 30 minute period during the course of a game.
[386:58.29]That motherfucker...
[387:03.96]does not leave you the fuck alone.
[387:11.80]It's horrible.
[387:14.52]It's so stressful and so scary.
[387:19.70]And just design-wise, he's just a really interesting designed character.
[387:23.68]I mean, it's just a huge guy.
[387:26.24]It's just a huge guy with a little top hat on and an overcoat.
[387:33.00]So...
[387:34.74]It's cool.
[387:36.82]But yeah.
[387:39.00]I actually think that Resident Evil 2... We're getting closer to the end of the year.
[387:43.35]Resident Evil 2 might be the best game of the year.
[387:49.17]I think so.
[387:50.23]It's going to be close.
[387:53.95]Sekiro?
[387:54.73]I wouldn't put Sekiro there.
[387:59.83]At least for me.
[388:02.81]I would put Sekiro somewhere... probably in the top, like, five.
[388:10.01]But I think, uh... I think Resident Evil 2 is the best game I've played this year in regards to just total, like, the whole thing.
[388:22.77]Goose Game?
[388:24.03]That's funny you say that, because I probably would put that somewhere in the top, like, five or top ten.
[388:30.25]What came out this year?
[388:33.21]Let me think.
[388:33.71]What, like, came out this year?
[388:35.31]Like, actual games that released this year.
[388:37.05]What came out this year?
[388:49.79]Smash came out, but I wouldn't put that up.
[388:53.59]It was cool.
[388:54.09]It was good, but I don't... Kingdom Hearts 3, I didn't even play it.
[388:56.77]Like, I don't want to.
[389:03.92]Let's see.
[389:07.27]Kingdom Hearts 3.
[389:10.91]Crackdown 3.
[389:14.23]Anthem, which I know.
[389:16.37]Metro Exodus, I didn't play it.
[389:18.31]Devil May Cry 5, I want to play it.
[389:24.54]Sekiro.
[389:25.18]Mortal Kombat 11, didn't play it.
[389:30.14]Control, didn't play it.
[389:37.44]uh no it's it's it's Resident Evil 2. unless something else comes out I think what came out for Nintendo Mario Maker 2 death stranding is coming out yeah
[390:09.04]What else?
[390:10.20]What else even really... Even like indie-wise, let me think of what I... You know what I have to... What I do?
[390:16.20]I have to go... Anytime that there's like an end-of-the-year scenario, it's like, what did I actually really like at the end of the year?
[390:22.45]I go back to my Steam purchase history and go to the year.
[390:26.55]And then look at what I've played.
[390:28.23]Yeah, it's Resident Evil 2.
[390:37.54]At least now.
[390:44.93]Big spender?
[390:47.29]No, I just need to remind myself what I bought in 2019.
[390:55.00]Please, do not criticize my Steam spending habits.
[391:00.08]All of us.
[391:01.90]Almost everybody in this channel right now is addicted to Steam.
[391:06.54]And buying Steam games.
[391:10.11]There's everybody here.
[391:11.29]Maybe some of you don't.
[391:13.98]I've been... I have, like... I think I have.
[391:16.84]I don't even know how many games I have.
[391:19.64]I've had... I'm trying to think... Okay, I can look.
[391:25.73]Every Steam sale that happens, people just buy them.
[391:29.63]You just do.
[391:31.39]That's how it was, and that's how it will be.
[391:38.00]When they... Even now, but they used to do...
[391:41.50]Five years ago, it was a big deal when a game was 75% off.
[391:46.72]Oh, there's a bundle.
[391:47.90]Here's the entire Ubisoft bundle.
[391:50.73]It's 75% off.
[391:52.61]It's normally like $165.
[391:53.35]Okay.
[391:53.67]I guess I'll own every single Ubisoft game.
[391:58.29]I guess.
[392:10.02]You buy games, you don't even play them.
[392:11.78]I have not done that for very many, though.
[392:20.68]Most of the... I would say almost all of the games that I've purchased, they're games that I've wanted to play.
[392:26.40]And even if they weren't, they're games that I eventually did for at least enough time to understand if I really cared about it.
[392:38.17]I get bored of games, like, halfway through.
[392:39.64]That happens to me all the time, too.
[392:43.54]A lot of you guys will ask, like, oh, how come you won't stream a game more than three, four, five times?
[392:49.74]It's because I don't really play very many games for more than, like, three, four, five sessions.
[392:57.93]It's not really necessarily a stream thing.
[393:00.19]Like, well, I don't want the view counts to drop.
[393:02.99]No, it's more of... It's...
[393:06.51]I lose attention on stuff more than halfway through.
[393:15.89]That's why playing games like, uh, back in the day, like playing TF2, and playing Diablo II, and some of these other games that I was obsessed with, it didn't matter how much time you spent.
[393:26.42]You could play it for an hour, or you could play it for ten.
[393:28.78]It didn't matter.
[393:29.30]You were gonna play it regardless.
[393:36.18]And a game has not really come along that has done that to me.
[393:41.87]Where, oh, I'm just going to turn it on for like two hours.
[393:44.57]And that's what I want to do today.
[393:53.54]That has not really happened.
[393:56.18]And I think that's one of the reasons why is because a lot of that has... A lot of those markets have kind of turned into, like, BR markets.
[394:05.61]Like Fortnite, Apex.
[394:07.83]I just don't... I don't really care about those games.
[394:12.05]They don't do it for me at all.
[394:24.20]I can understand why BR is an interesting experience.
[394:27.47]I just cannot stomach it.
[394:29.13]I just can't do it.
[394:32.83]Jerma won't even give a no to S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[394:36.81]What is with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[394:38.11]thing?
[394:42.33]I played, like, I played S.T.A.L.K.E.R., what, Call of Pripyat?
[394:45.47]I played it for, like, a stream or two.
[394:47.03]It was, like, three years ago.
[394:52.61]God dammit, like, is he ever gonna finish Stalker?
[394:56.25]We haven't seen a Stalker episode in three years.
[395:01.43]It's been a long time.
[395:02.56]That's back, like, I've been, I was living in Massachusetts still.
[395:11.60]He's not gonna play Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.
[395:15.89]Yeah, but that's just kind of how I play games anyways, too.
[395:22.97]I'll get... When I play a game, this is how you guys know that I actually like something.
[395:30.67]Like, really like a game.
[395:33.58]Really.
[395:35.16]Oh, that was kind of fun.
[395:36.24]Oh, this is kind of interesting.
[395:38.04]No, no, no.
[395:38.54]Like, truly enjoy and fully appreciate a video game if I want to finish it on stream.
[395:49.01]Because that means I really just want to play it and...
[395:54.00]I want to... I have... I livestream, don't I?
[396:05.16]Lifeline, Clocktower 3.
[396:08.56]Yeah, alright, hold on.
[396:09.40]There's a couple of variables here, though.
[396:13.44]Sometimes, you just have to get to the end, because you have to.
[396:23.25]There's no other reason.
[396:27.40]I was not going to see, after the first six, seven, eight hours of Clock Tower 3, I was not going to turn that stream off and then turn on Clock Tower 3 again.
[396:41.73]I knew it.
[396:44.39]We had to see it through that night.
[396:52.49]He's playing it out of obligation.
[396:54.95]Well, obligation to... I want... Needing to see how it ends because I know that I will not go back to it.
[397:01.35]It'll come out of the PlayStation 2.
[397:03.31]It'll go in a box.
[397:04.53]And then it'll turn into one of those scenarios where... Oh, yeah.
[397:06.89]I guess... Yeah, I could finish Clocktower 3 sometime.
[397:10.79]Maybe sometime.
[397:11.37]I don't know.
[397:11.71]I want to have Clocktower 3 and find a way... You know, scary monsters and try to get away from them.
[397:20.78]I mean, maybe one day...
[397:23.53]Get scared of them, maybe.
[397:28.32]No.
[397:29.20]I'm not going to go back to it.
[397:30.86]You have to do it sometimes.
[397:35.46]But, let's finish the bits.
[397:39.28]We're getting into some tangents here.
[397:43.47]I love getting on tangents.
[397:46.89]I do.
[397:47.95]It's one of my favorite things.
[397:52.65]You just got your Andy Marko in the mail, and you're watching the stream with the Andy Marko.
[397:58.25]Well, fuck yeah.
[398:00.29]Hell yeah.
[398:02.67]They're very cute.
[398:03.92]They're very great.
[398:05.20]That company is amazing.
[398:08.25]If you guys ever have anything that you need for anything to do with robotics, they sell all kinds of stuff.
[398:17.72]And they are a company full of wonderful, wonderful, wonderful people.
[398:21.74]Actually, like, just great people.
[398:30.33]Andy Mark.
[398:31.59]The... The folks that helped produce the Carnival Stream.
[398:37.07]They made the robots.
[398:43.54]They're awesome.
[398:46.59]Read bits, please.
[398:47.81]I'm doing it.
[398:48.85]I'm doing it.
[398:49.25]Wait, you gotta go to bed?
[398:50.29]Wait, you gotta go to sleep?
[399:04.25]Imagine sleeping.
[399:10.09]Sleepy chat.
[399:11.02]It's late.
[399:13.23]I mean, is it, though?
[399:14.49]What time is it?
[399:15.05]8, 9, 10, 11?
[399:15.91]It's a little late.
[399:17.57]It's a little bit late.
[399:23.27]S-L-O-M-E-G-A-L-E-L.
[399:26.95]That's not even correct.
[399:29.59]Anyways.
[399:31.45]Thank you to Kimmel for the $2.50.
[399:32.45]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching this since TF2 days.
[399:35.99]Glad to give back for all the amazing content.
[399:37.77]Keep it coming.
[399:40.23]I plan to.
[399:43.03]I plan to.
[399:45.07]Read the bits.
[399:45.57]My mom is screaming.
[399:49.63]Well, then you probably should get off the computer and go find out what that's about.
[400:00.52]Lovely, Carver.
[400:01.28]Thanks for the 2,500 bits.
[400:01.90]$25.
[400:01.96]Thank you.
[400:08.23]Hey Dermot, I've been watching you for about six years or so.
[400:10.59]I just recently took a big exam.
[400:12.81]Think, uh, like CPA exams.
[400:16.95]And in the middle of the testing area, which is dead silent, I started thinking of the Greedy Grinner and your no emotion bit and burst into laughter.
[400:26.31]They kicked me out and I failed the exam.
[400:28.95]No.
[400:32.34]They say unsubscribed.
[400:34.92]That's not good.
[400:41.33]That kind of reminds me, that reminds me of a story.
[400:46.46]That reminds me of a nice long-winded story that I'm gonna go off on here.
[400:54.18]One time, I took a picture.
[400:57.17]No, no, just listen to me.
[400:59.23]One time I took a picture of my friend.
[401:02.75]We were, he was in the backseat, we were on a road trip.
[401:06.93]And he was sleeping.
[401:09.87]And I just took a picture of his sleeping face because he was snoring really loudly.
[401:16.79]And it was like, oh my god, why is he sleeping so loudly?
[401:22.52]And I just took, he was just like, his mouth... His mouth was just open and his like eyes, it looked just like insane.
[401:34.16]So...
[401:36.56]Eventually, he woke up and he was like, I was like, look at how he was sleeping.
[401:40.75]He was like, holy shit, like, what the fuck?
[401:44.04]And seriously, for the next week,
[401:48.46]For the next week, I was at the grocery store, I was driving around, and I would just see the image of his face, and I would start laughing hysterically.
[402:01.53]I remember being at the checkout at a grocery store, and just... There's no reason for me to think about this image.
[402:10.21]And this is absolutely, absolutely like seven or eight days later.
[402:14.14]Had to be.
[402:16.58]I just started laughing.
[402:19.14]uncontrollably in the checkout.
[402:21.86]And I just kept going, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just, something really funny happened.
[402:29.28]And I remember the lady just being like, she was kind of laughing too.
[402:35.25]But this photo, I don't have it anymore, but it's, it's fucking funny.
[402:46.05]Patrick Bateman, what?
[402:53.35]No, not, it wasn't, she was like, she thought it was funny.
[402:56.64]I wasn't, guys, I wasn't being like a fucking weirdo.
[402:59.74]I wasn't like... No, I was just laughing, going, I'm sorry, something really funny happened.
[403:07.86]And I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to get through it, you know?
[403:10.44]And sometimes it pops in your head.
[403:12.08]She's like... It's contagious, it's funny.
[403:18.28]Actually crazy.
[403:19.27]No, it's, it was funny.
[403:26.36]Her friends told, no, her friends told her, she told her friends later that there was a serial killer in the store.
[403:31.96]No, that's not what happened.
[403:42.13]Okay, good, good story.

[404:31.36]Oh, also, remember you chose a duckling and named it Bilbo?
[404:34.62]Well, that duck's the tamest duck out of the hundreds.
[404:38.08]He follows any person through the yard and loves to cuddle.
[404:41.70]Here's a real, real short vid of him if you want to see.
[404:46.62]Thanks for all you do.
[404:50.68]Isn't that just fucking adorable?

[406:03.64]I have an update?
[406:25.26]Okay.
[406:26.82]Alright, let's watch this video.

[406:33.50]This one!
[406:36.08]There it is!
[406:44.32]Not that one.
[406:45.34]This one.
[406:53.35]This one.
[406:56.97]These are apparently, this is the ducks.
[407:01.14]So this is what happens every time I walk through the yard.
[407:09.86]Oh look, there he is.
[407:10.96]It's me.
[407:19.25]Hello.
[407:24.48]Why are you not paying attention to me?
[407:25.74]What are you doing, Bilbo?
[407:32.81]That's so cute.
[407:37.97]Bilbo.
[407:40.23]That's awesome.
[407:41.95]Thank you for sharing that.
[407:42.75]That was great.
[407:44.91]And that's the duck that I named.
[407:46.59]And out of all the ducks, out of the hundreds of ducks...
[407:51.50]That's the best one, is what you said?
[407:52.96]That's the most well-behaved, the most lovable, the most interesting?
[407:57.46]I mean, that's a pretty good pick, I think, of millions of ducks.
[408:08.39]Keep telling yourself that.
[408:10.61]Hey, I don't have to tell myself that.
[408:12.19]Somebody else told me that.
[408:13.89]I don't have to tell myself that.
[408:16.95]But I will continue to do that in the mirror later on this evening.
[408:29.50]But thank you though, seriously.
[408:31.58]That was an anonymous... Bring back the duck stream.
[408:41.14]Hey PotatoChief, thanks for the 700 bits.
[408:43.28]Dermot just turned 26 today.
[408:44.54]Here's your cut of the birthday money.
[408:46.57]Happy birthday.
[408:47.65]It's hard to imagine you're almost 30 years older than me.
[408:52.31]Anyways, love the streams and I hope you're feeling better soon.
[408:55.19]Okay, for a second I thought you were four.
[409:01.42]That's very advanced computer knowledge for a four-year-old.
[409:07.56]But no, happy birthday.
[409:09.36]Hope you have a good one.
[409:11.00]Hope you had a good one.
[409:11.82]I'm not sure what time it is for you now.
[409:14.57]But thank you.
[409:17.95]Thanks for the 700 bits.
[409:21.35]Casio plead thanks for the 500 bits.
[409:23.31]Hey Jeremy, it's my 20th birthday today.
[409:25.23]26th birthday and then 20th birthday here.
[409:28.11]Back to back.
[409:30.12]Uh, I had a very shitty day.
[409:33.22]Please give Otto a pat for me.
[409:34.70]I'm sorry to hear that.
[409:38.32]You want your birthday to be a good day.
[409:39.80]Hopefully it turns around.
[409:44.14]Sorry to hear that.
[409:48.61]But happy birthday.
[409:52.89]Take care of yourself.
[409:57.85]Can we get a few, uh, jermaHeart birthday man, please?
[410:02.25]Feels jermaBirthday heart man, please?
[410:08.38]But thank you for the 500 bits.
[410:10.50]Take care.
[410:11.08]Appreciate it.
[410:13.70]Vilemi, thanks for the thousand bits.
[410:18.08]Hey, Jerma, I don't know if you've confirmed this yet.
[410:19.58]I haven't been able to get to your streams very often.
[410:21.60]But is there a set date for the next green screen stream?
[410:23.86]No.
[410:25.07]No.
[410:26.78]There's not going to be a set date for it until I start to pull suggestions in a new Discord channel, and that will happen after Halloween.
[410:39.43]So, after Halloween, because we already have two channels open right now that people are doing stuff in, so... At some point after Halloween, you'll see that channel pop up.
[410:50.38]And that stream's going to happen in November, so...
[410:54.10]It'll probably be early, one of the first or second weeks of November, I would assume.
[411:00.99]But thank you so much.
[411:02.93]C4G, thanks for the 250.
[411:04.39]Rhythm Games means Hatsune Miku's stream debut, right?
[411:09.91]Right?
[411:11.87]Wrong.
[411:13.31]But thanks for the 250.
[411:13.77]Appreciate it.
[411:23.14]oh no chairman Pluto no not now I don't know not now and maybe not ever I don't know but thank you though I'll take the suggestion thank you uh argnator for the 300 bits
[411:49.22]Hey, Jerma, thanks for playing Fear.
[411:50.38]It's one of my favorite games, and you butchered it to near perfection.
[411:54.96]I did alright.
[411:55.80]I walked in a... Alright, hold on.
[411:58.70]I walked in a circle, like, a few times, and that was it.
[412:04.33]I did alright.
[412:05.33]I did alright.
[412:06.75]It was fun.
[412:07.39]I didn't... Come on.
[412:12.35]Come on.
[412:13.50]I did fine.
[412:14.10]I did... It was fun.
[412:17.44]Would you consider getting a perm to be curly?
[412:20.22]No.
[412:21.24]Curly didn't have hair.
[412:22.30]That's not even what you said.
[412:23.22]Uh, thank you for... You didn't even... There's no bits here.
[412:26.90]You just wrote that in chat.
[412:28.13]Thank you.
[412:34.93]Why would you read a perm comment?
[412:36.17]I don't know.
[412:38.16]But, no, I, uh...
[412:40.99]It was great.
[412:42.53]I can see why it's a lot of people's favorite games from a while back.
[412:48.79]It probably would be one of mine, too, if I had played it 10, 15 years ago.
[412:53.82]I hope your stomach gets in order and your energy can be restored so we can get more chunky, delicious, 15-hour, play-the-whole-game, not-a-joke, Clocktower 3-type streams.
[413:05.57]Tell Ster to get well soon, too.
[413:09.70]Thank you.
[413:11.47]Um... I mean, Darkwood... The last Darkwood stream was almost 12 hours.
[413:18.95]I started to lose my fucking mind at the end of that one.
[413:33.26]But...
[413:35.14]Doing more than 12, 15 hour streams.
[413:41.34]They kill me.
[413:43.52]I can't do them.
[413:46.77]I can't.
[413:48.67]Sometimes you can do... I don't know how people do it.
[413:52.05]I really don't.
[413:55.72]Trap joke, grenade joke, fall joke, dying joke, pretending joke.
[414:03.86]Why do people think that I'm pretending?
[414:10.20]It's pretending.
[414:12.20]You know how difficult it would be to pretend to do all that shit?
[414:18.35]It would take like three times the amount of work to pretend.
[414:24.03]Pretending not to pretend.
[414:30.17]Can you imagine setting up elaborate ways for you to step in like bear traps and that's what you're doing?
[414:38.11]Imagine like falling off a cliff like and pretending to do that more than like five times Can you imagine LUL?
[414:54.27]The spill jokes, no
[414:56.85]No, it's called not paying attention to my surroundings.
[415:04.19]I should get like my old guidance counselor from like the fucking ninth grade on the phone and ask them a few questions.
[415:26.99]Do you think it would be odd if I were to put down something and then forget I put it down?
[415:33.50]No, no.
[415:33.98]In fact, we had to give you a pen every day.
[415:37.72]Because you would bring a pen to school and you would not leave school with a pen.
[415:47.53]I've lost books before, guys.
[415:49.53]I've lost textbooks.
[415:57.69]Teachers would give me stuff and I just wouldn't, it would never come back.
[416:01.60]Oh, yeah, I'm gonna loan you this pen.
[416:03.28]I want this one back.
[416:04.60]Okay.
[416:07.52]I don't have it.
[416:09.46]Where'd it go?
[416:09.92]I don't know.
[416:12.58]Where is the pen?
[416:14.74]I don't know.
[416:15.18]I don't have.
[416:19.24]Okay.
[416:21.82]Well, here's another one.
[416:23.16]Don't lose this one.
[416:24.87]Thanks.
[416:25.11]I don't have it anymore.
[416:28.77]I just handed you the pen.
[416:31.57]I don't know.
[416:33.80]I just gave it to you.
[416:36.50]Did you eat it?
[416:39.12]I don't know.
[416:39.92]Maybe.
[416:45.40]And then I, like, smile.
[416:47.10]And I got a bunch of, like, wood in my teeth.
[416:51.18]And then we cut to commercial.
[416:52.96]Oh, well, that would be a funny show.
[416:55.21]It'd be called, like, Jerma just doesn't get it.
[417:10.35]Everybody hates Jorma.
[417:15.29]Bad pilot.
[417:17.17]Bad pilot, you said.
[417:18.53]Did you say bad pilot?
[417:21.91]Did you guys know that Young Sheldon exists as a television show?
[417:30.69]That makes 500 fucking million dollars.
[417:44.63]Wait a minute.
[417:46.19]It's not about making a good show.
[417:52.53]It would be about making as much money as possible.
[418:04.90]Yeah, you should see.
[418:06.18]You should see the huge grin I got right now.
[418:22.20]No.
[418:24.68]No, I called out almost all network television at the same time.
[418:41.77]Cut his mic.
[418:43.60]How original.
[418:48.24]Jerma is big bang tear comedy.
[418:52.82]Here's the difference, though.
[418:54.72]Uh, I don't... I don't pump in audience members.
[419:01.99]Okay, if you wanna go that far... That means that you've... That means that you've laughed at the Big Bang Theory, then.
[419:10.20]Oh, wait, wait!
[419:11.02]Wait, we can't have that!
[419:12.06]We can't have that!
[419:12.84]Uh-oh!
[419:16.74]Uh-oh!
[419:29.28]Big Bang Theory sucks.
[419:32.12]You know, actually, an old college professor told me one time that saying that something sucks is... You can't ever say something sucks if it makes that much money.
[419:47.51]Because that means that more people think it does not than think it does.
[419:57.11]Your professor sucks.
[420:10.97]Popularity does not equal quality.
[420:12.65]No, it doesn't, but I mean... Yeah, now that I think about it, that guy... Yeah, that guy was only my professor for like six months, and he got replaced.
[420:26.60]Shit.
[420:36.83]I'm kidding.
[420:37.61]Alright, alright.
[420:38.21]No, I'm not fucking around.
[420:41.68]I love fucking around, but we've got a job to do.
[420:54.78]Play Fear 2 right now.
[420:56.28]Why would I do that?
[420:56.96]Alright, that's it.
[420:59.18]Let's get the credits on.
[421:01.76]I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[421:07.94]See you on Saturday.
[421:10.85]Here come the credits.
[421:11.37]Thanks for subbing, everybody.
[421:14.27]Appreciate all the support, as always.
[421:17.07]The stream gets a lot of it, so thank you, seriously.
[421:20.58]We fuck around a lot.
[421:22.26]I talk a lot of bullshit all the time.
[421:26.04]But real, real, real, thank you for continuing to let me live this fucking life.
[421:37.72]Each and every one of you, thank you so much, seriously.
[421:42.63]Means a lot.
[421:46.25]But, while we see that, we still have a handful of bits to do.
[421:52.37]We had Creamy Sensation, gave 500 bits, planning to do anything on Halloween.
[421:56.77]Hope we get to see a lot of MonkaS moments.
[421:59.70]Yes, there's going to be an elaborate Halloween stream.
[422:06.16]Probably on Halloween day, I would assume.
[422:09.10]There will be a Halloween stream, yes.
[422:12.16]There's going to be a lot going on there.
[422:13.24]There's going to be a Secret Slime action part of that stream.
[422:16.02]Go check out the Discord, go to the Secret Slime discussion stream so you can see exactly what is going to happen there.
[422:23.04]Should be fun.
[422:25.04]But thank you for the 500 bits.
[422:26.04]Thank you GrumpClump for the 300 bits.
[422:27.57]GrumpClump!
[422:29.65]One of my mods.
[422:30.95]Can you tell my friend he did a great job on his video?
[422:35.25]Teehee.
[422:36.23]Thanks.
[422:38.31]That video was incredible.
[422:43.99]Oh, they forgot to link it.
[422:46.80]Oh.
[422:49.28]Let's see.
[422:56.92]He just lied.
[422:58.80]Well, it didn't say... It just... The message just said, hey, can you say that he did a good job on this video?
[423:08.03]Sure.
[423:09.25]What video?
[423:13.87]I was just like, alright, you did a great job on this video.
[423:15.56]It was great.
[423:20.24]Alright, let me see what this is.
[423:21.42]This is called frog.
[423:28.35]Hold on.
[423:34.31]Somebody get that, please.
[423:47.03]Can somebody get the fucking door, please?
[425:01.67]Did I lie about that video or was it as a great video so what are you guys talking about?
[425:16.05]What do you mean?
[425:17.89]I'm not watching the frog compilation.
[425:19.43]No, everyone was just yelling at me to go to bed.
[425:22.13]And, hey, hurry up and finish the bits.
[425:26.26]But let's watch a frog compilation.
[425:37.25]Why not?
[425:38.41]Thank you, GrumpClump.
[425:39.11]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[425:41.32]Slow update.
[425:41.82]Thanks for the $2.50.
[425:42.14]Hey, Jerma, just a quick update on my last donation.
[425:44.26]I was going to donate a lot more until I saw jermaSour, and now I'm not donating, but I'm suing for emotional damages.
[425:53.52]Happy to watch you again.
[425:54.32]See you next time.
[425:57.26]You know why that emote's there, right?
[425:59.80]Because I said out loud if that emote was not there within 24 hours, I would do a 24-hour stream.
[426:05.77]That emote is only there so I would not have to do a 24-hour stream.
[426:15.82]Came pretty close.
[426:16.50]Yeah, it was about an hour and a half before the stream started that it was there.
[426:22.02]Yeah.
[426:45.64]That happens at least two or three times.
[426:47.14]I was going to say a stream.
[426:50.10]That happens two or three times a shower, without a doubt.
[426:56.66]And my favorite part is, you know, you do that and then you piss in the shower.
[426:59.85]That's like the best part.
[427:03.37]Thanks for the 250.
[427:08.63]Thank you, water, for the 1500 bits.
[427:13.38]Hey, Jerma.
[427:13.60]I've been watching your YouTube channel for years.
[427:15.36]First time Twitch viewer, and I cannot thank you enough for all the laughs.
[427:20.36]You've done more good than you can imagine, and have truly changed not only mine, but many others' lives for the better.
[427:26.12]Thanks for being you.
[427:27.70]Long time fan.
[427:28.71]Water.
[427:29.89]Thank you.
[427:33.53]Welcome to the Twitch channel.
[427:38.13]I still have as much fun as I did here today.
[427:44.34]At the same amount that I had on the YouTube channel.
[427:47.80]I have a lot of fun.
[427:49.48]Thank you so much for the 1500 bits and thanks for hanging out.
[427:52.18]And I need to just quickly turn to the chat and just say that peeing in the shower is one of those weird things that everybody says, talks shit about, and says that's ridiculous, unbelievable, what the fucking God, disgusting, what a psycho.
[428:08.28]And you do it every single day.
[428:11.06]I don't know why people are like this.
[428:14.34]Is there a reason why people pretend that they do not pee in the shower?
[428:19.84]It's one of those things that people just... You're disgusting!
[428:26.24]You're gross!
[428:27.42]And then you're like groggy in the morning and you just look down and you just like pee into the drain.
[428:32.83]Nobody knows I did that but me.
[428:49.12]it's just pipes what's the difference what do you mean how does it smell you don't look you don't you don't pee into a hot shower you open up the door you turn the shower on and you pee into the shower
[429:23.47]Okay, my stomach hurts.
[429:25.61]There's a perfectly good toilet right behind you.
[429:31.43]But you don't give a shit.
[429:33.67]For some reason.
[429:34.59]No, I'm fucking kidding.
[429:51.54]But I'm just...
[429:53.62]I'm seeing it in my head.
[429:55.54]I'm watching the thing I'm saying that I'm conveying is real.
[429:59.22]And I'm imagining what you're seeing in your head and it's making me laugh fucking hard.
[430:04.20]Because the second I start talking about it, people just start... It's... I'm kidding.
[430:14.13]No, I... No, I do not pee into the shower from outside the shower.
[430:20.45]I do it while I'm in there.
[430:23.05]Like a normal person.
[430:34.12]Define in.
[430:35.02]Like I'm talking in.
[430:36.12]You're standing in.
[430:37.22]Alright, we're not going to even go over this.
[430:38.76]Everybody does this shit.
[430:39.96]Everybody pretends like they don't do it.
[430:41.63]And like the three of you that actually don't do this.
[430:48.39]Good work.
[430:50.24]Because you're amongst a sea of liars right now.
[431:02.47]What about the sink?
[431:03.37]No, no, no.
[431:03.93]Excuse me.
[431:05.95]There are lines.
[431:06.91]No, absolutely not.
[431:13.30]Why do people pretend that they don't take their shirts off to poo?
[431:17.98]That's another mystery.
[431:32.59]Do you guys okay?
[431:34.07]No, we're not gonna go here but just know that uh for the longest time I was I used to actually I still kind of do it sometimes I Completely naked to take a shit Like I'm talking not even socks You know how difficult it is to go to the bathroom in a public bathroom
[431:59.45]When you have to take off every single article of clothing, including your shoes and socks.
[432:04.88]It's impossible.
[432:24.97]I'm saying I've never done that.
[432:27.81]That's too hard.
[432:39.80]What the fuck is happening?
[432:40.96]Why is... The credits... Okay.
[432:51.05]Ugh.
[432:54.28]and walking into like a public bathroom and you're going to like wash your hands and you see like draped over the top of the stall like a shirt, pants, underwear, socks and the guy's shoes are out in front of the stall.
[433:09.97]What the fuck is going on in here?
[433:30.19]God.
[433:32.19]Alright.
[433:33.17]Let's get out of here.
[433:35.35]Thanks, everybody.
[433:35.97]Oh, fuck.
[433:37.57]I closed the website.
[433:40.01]I closed the website.
[433:41.07]Do people still call them websites?
[433:43.78]Or do you just say, like, I closed my tab or my site?
[433:46.80]Do you say website still?
[433:54.46]There's no cool new way to say that?
[433:58.66]Window.
[433:59.06]Yeah, there you go.
[434:00.58]You close the window.
[434:01.66]You don't close the website.
[434:02.70]You close the window.
[434:03.42]Alright.
[434:10.84]Let's finish this.
[434:16.75]Thanks for sticking around.
[434:18.63]We have just a couple more to do.
[434:23.51]Thank you, HaveGun, for the 250.
[434:25.67]Hey, Jerma, if you enjoyed Fear, you might want to give Shogo Mobile Armor Division a look.
[434:32.18]It's a pretty fun 90s shooter by Monolith.
[434:34.22]Monolith made a lot of great games.
[434:37.58]I wonder what they're doing now, after Shadow War.
[434:43.12]Thank you, Vilemi, for the 2,000 bits.
[434:47.87]Thank you.
[434:49.91]20 bucks here total.
[434:50.51]I'm not addicted to buying games, I'm just addicted to giving Jerma bits.
[434:55.82]You don't have to do that.
[434:57.44]But thank you regardless.
[434:59.34]And then they say, at this point, we really need the Jerma Psycho emote.
[435:04.22]Fine.
[435:10.63]I don't know.
[435:11.59]The Jerma Psycho emote has to be that image.
[435:16.43]On something.
[435:17.05]I don't know.
[435:17.63]I have to find one.
[435:21.25]Which face is it going to be?
[435:22.39]I don't know.
[435:25.38]If it's not ready by Saturday, we get... No, I'm not doing that again.
[435:29.14]But it'll probably be there on Saturday.
[435:30.54]But I'm not giving up.
[435:31.18]No, I'm not doing that.
[435:32.80]I could not do a 24-hour stream right now, even if I lost that bet.
[435:36.26]I'm too screwed up right now.
[435:38.68]On this medication, so... I'm actually surprised I'm able to be here for this long.
[435:43.98]It's actually because I've been eating very light today.
[435:47.03]That's probably why.
[435:49.39]So this stream was really not supposed to be more than like four or five hours long.
[435:53.25]But I've been okay.
[435:54.05]I felt alright, so... I'm cool to hang out.
[436:00.08]But... There will be one soon.
[436:02.86]Finally, Stifunky Chicken, thanks for the 400 bits.
[436:05.80]Did you get my other bit message?
[436:07.08]If not, I just said the thing was a tricky game where if you don't manage it correctly, you can softlock yourself.
[436:14.29]It's fun when you know what you're doing.
[436:17.45]Plan on two or three save files where two of them get softlocked, I would assume.
[436:24.67]This is the one right here.
[436:25.43]Let's see.
[436:30.24]Yeah, I'll find one.
[436:31.60]Some of these are good.
[436:38.64]I'll get a good one.
[436:40.16]I'll get a damn good one.
[436:48.75]Wait.
[436:49.59]No, now it sounds like I don't think Kim is funny.
[436:53.39]I like this one.
[436:55.19]It'll probably be this one.
[436:59.26]Yeah.
[437:00.10]But that's not... This is not even Jerma's Psycho.
[437:03.66]Look.
[437:04.46]That's not Jerma's Psycho.
[437:06.42]That's fucking... That's like Jerma deranged.
[437:10.20]That's Jerma scary.
[437:17.39]That's not the same thing.
[437:27.22]I'll find one.
[437:32.62]Use the deepfake?
[437:34.13]We'll see.
[437:40.59]But, that is gonna be it.
[437:42.33]I'll see you guys later.
[437:47.68]Have a fantastic next day.
[437:51.34]I'll see you guys very soon.
[437:56.53]What do you mean, wait?
[437:57.45]Wait, wait, wait, wait, what do you mean, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait?
[438:01.47]What are we waiting for?
[438:02.05]What's the matter?
[438:09.48]What are we waiting for?
[438:16.30]Okay, you can go.
[438:16.84]Oh, thanks.
[438:18.68]What did Kim... What's the first thing Kim said to me?
[438:23.96]Um... I don't know, like...
[438:31.50]Uh, she said I was a, she said I was a C minus.
[438:47.24]Yeah, I remember I was like, oh, what would, what would you give me for like a, that's not the first thing though.
[438:50.28]That's like, I don't know, after like a, maybe like five days, four or five days of, uh,
[438:58.58]of like hanging out.
[438:59.30]I was like, what would you give me for like a letter grade?
[439:02.10]And I'm like, I would give you an A. Like, I give you an A. She's like, you get a C minus.
[439:12.63]And then, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[439:13.87]This story, there's a small little, hold on, interestingly enough.
[439:18.21]After another... I mean, it was a joke.
[439:20.75]She was making a joke, and I laughed at it, because she knows that I think things are funny.
[439:24.69]You know, we laughed.
[439:26.23]And then, a few weeks later, I asked again.
[439:29.19]Hey, what was... Did I increase my... Would I still be at a C-?
[439:33.93]Nope.
[439:34.53]I went up to a B+.
[439:38.57]And now... What is it now?
[439:43.04]Kim's here now.
[439:43.76]Kim's in the chat.
[439:44.92]What is it now?
[439:47.69]I mean, it's been almost three years.
[439:49.43]What is it now?
[440:09.00]What?!
[440:13.38]No!
[440:17.13]Come on, you're supposed to say, you get an A. You get an A+.
[440:26.59]And then everybody goes, oh, what?
[440:32.34]And I go, oh.
[440:39.36]I just got dunked on.
[440:41.22]A B, A, B plus is great.
[440:43.40]That means solid, very good,
[440:48.34]Not too good where you're like trying too hard.
[440:52.00]You know, like a B plus is perfect.
[440:54.56]I think B plus is the best grade you could possibly get.
[440:56.39]You'd be an A if you weren't bald.
[441:17.53]Oh my god.
[441:22.38]There's context for what Kim just said, okay?
[441:25.72]She... I don't... Okay, listen.
[441:29.20]I gotta... I have to... I gotta explain this one.
[441:31.74]Because I can't leave after a bombshell like that one.
[441:36.90]I don't have any tattoos.
[441:38.94]Kim has a lot.
[441:40.67]So... She was referring to...
[441:45.35]I don't have any tattoos.
[441:47.05]I want you to get a tattoo.
[441:51.41]And, uh, no.
[441:53.09]That's not gonna happen.
[441:54.64]The only tattoo I would ever get would be the fucking venom symbol on my shoulder.
[441:58.48]Almost got that tattoo, by the way.
[442:01.00]I was potentially hours from getting the venom symbol across my entire left shoulder.
[442:06.43]Thank God I didn't do that.
[442:16.75]Because now I'm going to get it on my chest where it belongs.
[442:23.55]Hey, anonymousgifter, thanks for the five community subs.
[442:26.02]Appreciate that.
[442:29.74]And that's it.
[442:33.50]I will see you guys on Saturday.
[442:39.73]It's over.
[442:41.95]It is over.
[442:45.51]Goodbye.
[442:46.33]Good night.
[442:47.69]See you Saturday.
[442:50.39]I missed... Did I miss bits?
[442:51.59]What do you mean?
[442:51.95]Where?
[442:53.77]From where?
[442:57.73]No, I got them all.
[443:06.26]I don't see any from... I missed... You missed my bits.
[443:11.68]Did you... Was it... Did you give 250? 250?
[443:17.86]It's not highlighted.
[443:20.44]Where is it?
[443:24.86]Where is it?
[443:28.74]This should have everything.
[443:34.20]So, oh yeah, it was right at the beginning.
[443:38.64]So I saw Kourei was here.
[443:40.16]I wonder why that didn't get picked up.
[443:43.50]Because Kourei's is the first one.
[443:47.63]Well, sorry about that.
[443:49.65]Uh, I didn't see it.
[443:53.09]But that was from C, uh, from... I fuck up this, I'm gonna fuck your name up bad.
[444:01.58]CZexonS.
[444:03.62]Or Zexon?
[444:05.34]Zexon?
[444:06.00]S?
[444:07.70]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[444:10.08]It is here?
[444:10.50]Yeah, I know it's here.
[444:12.42]Oh, it actually shows you how to pronounce it.
[444:15.44]Chexin.
[444:16.64]Chexin S. Okay.
[444:18.34]Hope you're feeling better soon, my man.
[444:20.10]I've been watching you since your early YouTube days, and your streams are always a gateway to having a better day.
[444:25.37]My birthday was last Saturday, and I missed your stream, but I wanted to say my girlfriend got me a super cool gift.
[444:30.79]She printed all your Twitch emotes as stickers, and they're so cool.
[444:34.81]That's awesome.
[444:36.95]My favorites are Germaboomer and jermaChomp.
[444:40.06]Thanks for all the entertainment.
[444:41.06]That's lovely.
[444:45.46]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[444:47.22]Sorry I missed it earlier.
[444:51.22]But it was not on here before.
[444:55.22]Strangely enough.
[444:59.86]But yeah, happy birthday.
[445:02.52]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[445:03.94]And that's a really, really adorable, awesome gift.
[445:08.31]Thank you.
[445:09.99]Well, thank you for the 500 bits.
[445:12.41]That's your gift, not mine.
[445:15.99]Alright.
[445:17.03]I will see you guys on Saturday.
[445:20.14]I'm still going to be fucked up from this medicine, so... Hopefully we don't have any issues during that stream.
[445:28.44]Because that will be... I'll be on it for about three, four full days.
[445:32.18]And it takes a good two plus days to have it really get into your system, apparently.
[445:39.79]So, I don't know.
[445:40.73]We'll find out.
[445:42.05]We'll just cross that bridge when we do.
[445:44.71]Have a wonderful, wonderful Friday.
[445:46.46]See you Saturday.
[445:48.14]Goodbye.
