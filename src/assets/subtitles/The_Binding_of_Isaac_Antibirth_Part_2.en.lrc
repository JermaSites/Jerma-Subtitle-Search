[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.02]Hello.
[00:03.68]What's going on?
[00:04.74]How are ya?
[00:13.34]Wait, somebody said, you know it's bad if he's playing Isaac.
[00:18.07]What does that mean?
[00:20.65]Oh man, you know it's bad if he's playing Isaac.
[00:24.93]Well, I'll give you, we'll talk about this for just a quick second.
[00:29.42]Let me, let me, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:30.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:32.55]Wait, wait, wait.
[00:33.75]Okay.
[00:35.81]There we go.
[00:37.81]I had to tweet it.
[00:41.06]I'm not even here.
[00:42.68]Just watch the fucking... I'll be back in like a minute.
[01:35.19]So Kristen goes to the grocery store and she buys 15 apples.
[01:41.23]She trades those apples to David for 40 bananas.
[01:50.96]Those 40 bananas are then turned into a banana puree and put on top of a cake, which is then sold for $100.
[02:03.15]What was her first name?
[02:11.37]Yeah, I got you.
[02:20.69]I got fucked over from that one, like, a few hours ago.
[02:25.68]I got fucked over from that one.
[02:26.98]It was like, oh, how many... And times two, minus that, it was like, oh, what was their name?
[02:33.02]Oh, fuck.
[02:33.76]It was, I don't know, Jen?
[02:36.92]They got you guys, too.
[02:41.22]Uh, yeah, so today... Uh, I'm gonna play Isaac today.
[02:46.05]I did say I was gonna play it yesterday.
[02:47.75]I also said I wanted to play City Skylines, but... I'll be honest with you.
[02:53.91]Uh... Kinda hurting today.
[02:57.13]So I figured I would just sit back for a little bit and play... Uh, something that I know how to do.
[03:03.67]And just chill for a little bit.
[03:06.53]So, uh... Took some Advil.
[03:08.93]Just gonna hang out.
[03:13.59]Oh, no, okay, for those of you, I'm not, like, sick.
[03:16.19]For those of you that are like, wait, what are you talking about?
[03:18.35]Why are you taking Advil?
[03:22.11]Uh, no, it's my back and chest and shit.
[03:25.24]But I'll be alright for a little while.
[03:26.60]I just want to get that out there.
[03:28.94]Uh, so City Skylines is going to be the first thing we do.
[03:32.36]And I figure let's just do a whole stream on it.
[03:34.94]Rather than try to do, like, two hours of Isaac, three hours of Isaac, and then, like, go do, like, four hours of City Skylines.
[03:42.72]I'd rather just do a full stream on it.
[03:44.73]Maybe a few of them.
[03:49.61]But, that's the next thing we're going to do.
[03:53.77]But I do want to stream today, and I do want to play Isaac.
[03:56.85]So, that's what we're going to do.
[03:58.83]Because I can't reliably tell you how long I'm going to be able to sit here for.
[04:03.01]I'm going to just be 1,000% honest.
[04:06.27]I don't think this is going to be an 8-hour stream.
[04:08.55]No, not like last time.
[04:13.24]So, without further ado... Did I tweet this shit?
[04:20.82]Here comes 16.
[04:21.94]I'd be very surprised.
[04:28.12]I would be very surprised.
[04:30.99]I'll go as long as I can.
[04:32.27]I don't know.
[04:35.81]This whole thing's been, like, flaring up like crazy.
[04:38.41]It's like... The last, like, three weeks, it's just been like, fuck.
[04:46.62]I must have been doing, like, physical therapy.
[04:48.84]Maybe I'm, like, I've aggravated it, and it's, like, just maybe... I don't know.
[04:54.71]But, anyways, we're gonna do anti-birth.
[04:56.71]I'm gonna try to actually beat the fucking boss of this game.
[05:03.90]I mean, I'm gonna try to beat the actual encounter.
[05:08.50]Oh, he's aggravated.
[05:10.32]Take it easy.
[05:10.82]Don't worry, I'm fine.
[05:13.47]I am fine.
[05:13.99]That's why I'm telling you already, if it gets to the point like it already happened this week, I'll just call it, right?
[05:22.25]We'll try again.
[05:24.61]I'm open.
[05:26.77]So, let's go.
[05:28.49]Binding of Isaac.
[05:30.38]Ooh, I just hit you.
[05:31.38]Where am I going to put my cheat sheet?
[05:34.14]Oh, over here.
[05:36.78]That fits over there.
[05:37.95]Watch out for the GameCube disks.
[05:40.61]There we go.
[05:42.61]Alright, webcam's not on, right?
[05:43.83]No.
[05:44.09]Okay.
[05:44.29]I don't have any fucking clothes on.
[05:50.34]He doesn't want us to worry.
[05:51.86]No, don't worry.
[05:54.22]Do not worry about me.
[05:55.54]Don't worry about me.
[05:56.54]Don't do it.
[05:57.26]Don't do it.
[05:59.43]Alright, who do I want to play with?
[06:01.37]And you guys have to help me here.
[06:03.15]Because, seriously, I'm going to forget about the fire shit.
[06:06.07]I'm going to forget about the puzzle stuff.
[06:07.75]I'm going to do Judas.
[06:10.21]Who do you want me to start with?
[06:16.11]I fucking love this game.
[06:18.53]I'm obsessed with this game.
[06:22.25]Just do random?
[06:26.53]Use mods that... Oh, this is a mod.
[06:28.58]This is Antibirth.
[06:30.28]There are other mods for Isaac?
[06:32.82]Random, random, random, random.
[06:34.62]How do you do random?
[06:37.51]Oh, there it is.
[06:38.31]Alright, here we go.
[06:38.77]It actually spins a wheel.
[06:44.63]Oh, god damn it.
[06:47.53]Alright.
[06:48.35]Fucking Azazel.
[06:49.67]Really?
[06:51.09]Okay.
[06:55.99]Let's go.
[06:58.58]Do I really want to play as Azazel right now?
[07:00.90]Oh, fuck.
[07:03.74]Azazel... Okay, I need a warm-up, though.
[07:08.76]I need one warm-up round.
[07:10.06]This is not the... What is it pronounced?
[07:14.65]I need a warm-up round.
[07:19.35]Free Lemonade.
[07:22.89]Azazel's not the character you play when you warm it up.
[07:24.73]Azazel's the character you play when you're like...
[07:28.71]I fucking played like six rounds already, and I'm not ready to go.
[07:30.73]Like, kill everything in one second.
[07:33.53]How do you pronounce it?
[07:34.17]Is it the Steam Workshop mods?
[07:39.82]What does this lemonade do?
[07:42.18]Azazel.
[07:45.54]Azazel?
[07:46.58]It's Azazel.
[07:52.81]Well, what did I say?
[07:54.25]Azazel?
[07:56.19]I kind of like mine better.
[08:01.20]Don't, don't you?
[08:04.83]Extra lemonade, whatever.
[08:05.73]Fuck.
[08:08.97]Alright, this is that, this is, this is a delete.
[08:10.89]That's, I got one heart.
[08:14.47]I think this is a delete scenario.
[08:21.25]Have it your way.
[08:24.27]Did somebody just say the Burger King jingle?
[08:29.00]Hey dude, have it your way.
[08:33.72]He's dying with Azazel.
[08:36.74]I'm warming up!
[08:37.70]It's a warm-up round, don't you know?
[08:39.30]There's a window here that's causing some kind of lag for some reason.
[08:47.41]Don't ask me why.
[08:48.07]What's going on here?
[08:48.83]Alright, my cheat sheet's open in an iPad window.
[08:52.44]Alright, what else do I got?
[08:55.82]I'm going down here.
[09:03.28]He's already making excuses.
[09:06.64]Yeah, that's what I... And I can do that.
[09:08.85]I can make excuses.
[09:10.55]I can say... Nah, this fucking thing doesn't even work.
[09:13.95]Like, I can say anything I want.
[09:15.82]I can tell you that my control is broken.
[09:18.06]Like, I can tell you that the analog on my thumb just came off.
[09:21.76]When I died.
[09:22.26]Like, oh, I died.
[09:23.62]Oh, fuck, dude, my analog just came off.
[09:26.26]And I have a dummy analog stick here, and I can put it on camera.
[09:29.06]And people will be like, oh, fuck, I guess his analog fucking came off.
[09:33.44]That's fucked up.
[09:34.14]I've never heard of that before.
[09:35.08]I don't ever trust anything anyone ever tells you.
[09:39.66]Especially me.
[09:45.48]He's always, always lying.
[09:48.30]Fuck, what a wash this is.
[09:50.98]Not yet.
[09:53.40]Not yet.
[09:55.48]Not a wash yet.
[09:56.48]Okay.
[10:03.78]I'll just open it.
[10:04.28]Let's go.
[10:06.22]Ooh, good.
[10:08.22]Those of you that have no idea what's going on, this is anti-birth.
[10:11.15]This is not the regular Binding of Isaac.
[10:15.15]Do we have any tinted rocks?
[10:18.41]Nobody's been spamming tinted rocks.
[10:22.52]I haven't seen a single tinted rock spam.
[10:27.53]There's one back to the left, because I got five bombs.
[10:39.15]Two stone and one tint.
[10:44.15]I don't think there is any.
[10:47.01]No.
[10:47.53]Somebody would have been like, Dude, it's in room A7!
[10:51.80]Be like, oh, fuck, right.
[10:54.72]Let's go.
[10:56.58]What the fuck does this lemonade even do?
[10:57.98]I haven't even tried to use it.
[11:04.40]It just makes you pee?
[11:07.78]I'm gonna try.
[11:08.10]I'm gonna use it in this next room.
[11:10.67]Never mind.
[11:11.05]Wait.
[11:11.85]Lightning.
[11:12.59]Oh, shit.
[11:13.85]Fuck it, throwers.
[11:18.55]Come on, Azazel.
[11:24.47]No, that's just that, okay.
[11:26.25]Rock!
[11:28.69]Oh fuck, not a lie!
[11:30.19]Okay, I gotta start listening to you guys every day.
[11:32.19]Alright, this is not over yet.
[11:39.28]The next one is two bombs, right?
[11:49.78]You should listen to us.
[11:54.78]He needs to listen to us more often.
[11:56.68]I do, you're right.
[11:57.88]What are these?
[11:58.32]Yeah, but I'm Azazel, though.
[12:01.25]Like, none of the cool items do anything with Azazel.
[12:08.51]That's like the super tier, right?
[12:10.29]Left, left, left, left.
[12:12.71]Mega tiers.
[12:13.35]Does that work with Azazel?
[12:18.16]Look at how long this takes to charge!
[12:21.01]One, two, three.
[12:23.63]Oh my god.
[12:26.83]That's a shitload of damage, but I'm not gonna be able to attack anything.
[12:31.24]Alright, I gotta queue it up before I go into every room.
[12:38.39]Oh, for the love of...
[12:50.92]God damn it, man.
[12:52.08]The hard counter.
[12:57.81]Fuck.
[12:58.65]That sucked.
[13:00.35]Do I have any hearts?
[13:03.05]Look at the damage though.
[13:03.89]It's so good.
[13:08.16]Fuck.
[13:11.26]It's so long.
[13:13.48]It's so long.
[13:17.76]I've melt bosses.
[13:18.68]I just gotta stay alive.
[13:24.96]Okay, just right just go with a sad face Damn it There's no spirit hearts in here.
[13:34.74]I thought that was gonna be Just go I just I just just go I
[13:55.34]Get the pill.
[13:55.98]This is going to be like tears down, and it's going to ruin the whole run.
[14:01.44]If this is tears down, I'm going to reset.
[14:02.64]Ooh, what's this?
[14:16.89]Talos, your feet feels... Oh, I can walk over spikes, right?
[14:19.42]That's what this thing does?
[14:20.18]Okay, let's go.
[14:25.45]Alright, it's useless?
[14:28.59]Bomb the left.
[14:29.27]You want me to bomb over here?
[14:32.61]That could be the secret room, you're right.
[14:35.79]You could literally fly.
[14:39.36]Right, right, I can literally fly.
[14:42.82]Alright, don't use all these bombs, but I need this shit.
[14:51.55]Come on.
[14:56.57]Imagine being able to fly and, like, buying fucking... Ah, goddammit.
[15:06.68]I'm so dumb.
[15:07.76]Alright, Beezlebub.
[15:11.78]Okay, well that was fun.
[15:18.51]HP up.
[15:19.71]That was, okay, this could work out pretty well.
[15:23.27]Get nail.
[15:24.05]Get the nail.
[15:24.95]Get the nail?
[15:25.91]How much health do I have?
[15:28.12]Wait, that's not the nail.
[15:29.22]That's a different nail.
[15:34.34]Yes, get nail.
[15:35.32]Who cares?
[15:35.82]Get nail.
[15:36.30]Should I get the nail?
[15:37.72]How many hearts do I have?
[15:40.99]If I pick this up, is it going to kill me?
[15:44.75]You can't get the nail.
[15:47.57]Don't fall for it.
[15:48.53]Don't get the nail.
[15:49.11]Don't fall for it.
[15:50.95]What about this thing?
[15:53.38]Get this for more hearts.
[15:54.36]Get them both.
[15:58.02]Do it, please.
[15:58.92]Nail, you're a coward.
[16:01.26]Mask, definitely.
[16:03.16]You cannot get the nail.
[16:04.52]No, you can get the nail.
[16:06.62]I'm getting this.
[16:15.87]I don't want the nail.
[16:17.17]I don't know.
[16:19.65]It's ruined.
[16:25.13]No, the nail fucked up the last run.
[16:29.21]You can't get the nail now.
[16:30.15]No, the nail fucked up the last run.
[16:31.67]I don't want it.
[16:33.56]On principle.
[16:42.14]I fucked up.
[16:42.72]No, I didn't fuck up the last run.
[16:46.51]Didn't everyone say that I was going to get three hearts for this?
[16:53.95]I thought, guys, you guys said if I got gimpy that it was gonna give me three hearts.
[16:59.13]It gave me one!
[16:59.89]Oh, man.
[17:02.27]Who said that?
[17:03.05]I don't know, somebody did!
[17:03.99]I swear to god, I read it!
[17:06.65]Like, five times!
[17:09.59]Don't worry, I'm just not gonna get hit.
[17:12.97]Fucking hard counter, come on!
[17:14.63]Come on, Ed!
[17:23.45]I'm just not going up there again.
[17:31.11]These things are rocks.
[17:40.72]The run... No, the run's not over yet.
[17:43.64]Not over yet.
[17:46.69]Should have got the nail.
[17:48.33]I could have... Oh my god!
[17:52.25]Whatever.
[17:52.77]Whatever's a warm-up anyways.
[17:54.01]Who gives a shit?
[17:55.27]Throw the fucking dice.
[17:56.15]Alright, I'm okay with this.
[18:05.40]I'm okay with this.
[18:05.88]This is Judas.
[18:07.76]Let's go.
[18:10.28]He's already malding.
[18:11.30]No, I'm not.
[18:11.97]You can't... There's no malding in Isaac unless you die at...
[18:17.34]Like 48 minutes of a run at a boss.
[18:21.08]No, this is nature of the game.
[18:22.52]Nature of the game.
[18:23.32]What is that?
[18:25.28]Rock Blast.
[18:26.06]Okay, I've seen this before.
[18:27.72]Five bombs.
[18:34.58]Just a reminder that you didn't beat Odama.
[18:38.15]No, I... Nope, I didn't.
[18:39.77]And I'll... Go ahead.
[18:41.87]You can... You can tack that on my permanent record.
[18:45.77]I don't... That's fine.
[18:52.54]I'll look at my streamer report card at the end of the year, or at the end of the semester, and yeah, okay, I'll get like fucking... like a C- in didn't finish a fucking game.
[19:06.27]You didn't finish as many games as you were supposed to in 2020, semester one.
[19:11.46]Because you got an F on Odama.
[19:13.30]It just brought me down.
[19:14.14]I got like a fucking C- on, what was that one I just beat?
[19:17.70]Katana ZERO.
[19:21.60]What's the last game that I beat?
[19:22.54]What's the last game that I completed?
[19:25.68]What was it?
[19:30.36]Super Mario Sunshine.
[19:31.31]Okay, yeah.
[19:31.77]That's fine.
[19:34.97]I'll take that.
[19:44.04]None.
[19:44.30]You're just talking over somebody else's gameplay.
[19:52.06]Now, I beat a game before that.
[19:53.24]That hurts me?!
[20:00.65]What?!
[20:02.47]Oh no!
[20:03.33]What the fuck?!
[20:08.25]My own- that- that trickle comes over and hurts me!
[20:11.78]That's such a good item to get though, I have seven damage, I can't fuck this up.
[20:17.70]Oh, I didn't even know that's so bad.
[20:23.07]Well, let's go.
[20:27.97]The run's not over.
[20:28.73]I got full health again.
[20:31.73]He's never played Bomberman.
[20:34.89]You know, I've played Bomberman, but I played Bomberman 64.
[20:40.03]That was it.
[20:40.99]Stay away from me.
[20:47.27]Stay away from this fucking guy.
[21:00.45]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:02.29]Fine.
[21:03.61]Not even a single fucking hit.
[21:04.69]Oops.
[21:05.87]What's... What's that?
[21:10.67]Plus one to lowest stat.
[21:14.46]Oh, that's pretty cool.
[21:17.64]At least I can move around fast.
[21:18.58]I need health.
[21:20.71]Alright, let's go.
[21:21.63]Oh, beautiful.
[21:22.79]I need... Oh my god, where do I stand?
[21:24.35]Right here.
[21:26.41]Fuck you, game.
[21:31.56]He never apologized.
[21:37.28]Sorry.
[21:48.11]I'll give you a quick little tip on playing games like this.
[21:52.85]Focus less on where you're shooting and more just on your immediate surroundings so you don't get hit by anything.
[22:02.34]Except for when things blend into the ground.
[22:05.34]Oh, I can't walk over here.
[22:09.92]Okay, that was like... I don't even know what the fuck those things even did.
[22:13.26]Like, give me a break.
[22:16.55]They just, like, appear next to you.
[22:18.13]That's a great tip.
[22:27.71]Yeah.
[22:30.11]And even- I was paying attention to my immediate surroundings.
[22:33.22]Snakes were appearing next to me.
[22:39.14]Nope.
[22:42.34]No.
[22:43.44]Abso-fucking-lutely not.
[22:44.36]It's the worst item in the whole game.
[22:59.14]Hold R. Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[23:16.87]No rewinds.
[23:22.31]Well, you're probably wondering why is he doing this.
[23:23.89]Because I know I'll fucking walk into it accidentally.
[23:48.55]You fucking die, oh my god!
[23:50.07]How is he not getting hit?
[23:56.56]Pog!
[23:58.84]This is like not- God damn it, stop making me laugh!
[24:05.81]Oh, you fucking making me laugh!
[24:10.74]That room's like not even hard.
[24:13.40]It was like, I mean, it was annoying, but like I could have been fine.
[24:16.52]Oh, dude, how is he not getting hit?
[24:18.48]Fog!
[24:21.54]Good thing this is a warm-up round.
[24:22.84]This two-tinted rock.
[24:31.04]Oh, this is fucking bad.
[24:32.69]Game over.
[24:33.35]Oh, that was fun.
[24:35.41]Okay, let's do it again.
[24:36.13]Maybe we'll get a good run.
[24:50.65]Alright, just blow yourself up.
[24:53.89]It's just the 5th one, it's the nature of the game.
[24:59.97]Fight it, fight it!
[25:02.53]See, it's the nature of the game.
[25:04.44]Mr. Mega Blast Damage.
[25:06.02]Okay, that's not bad.
[25:09.84]Oh, dude.
[25:11.32]It's like the enemies are going like this.
[25:12.86]And it's like, oh my god, holy shit!
[25:18.19]He's so good.
[25:19.41]Pog.
[25:23.95]That's so funny.
[25:29.63]Oh, that's gonna make me laugh for the rest of the day.
[25:32.56]So thank you for that.
[25:34.00]Whoever the fuck you were.
[25:36.58]I didn't see the name.
[25:41.82]Take that pill.
[25:42.50]Hold on.
[25:42.96]I've got these, like, weird enemies.
[25:46.66]I gotta fight these flies.
[25:52.24]Okay, let me give you some insight.
[25:54.28]If you play games and talk at the same time, you'll know.
[25:58.12]You know what I'm talking about.
[26:00.18]Where words don't... You can't say them while you're concentrating.
[26:06.17]Your brain has to focus on the concentration aspect.
[26:09.31]And you've been on the phone... I'll give you some... You've been on the phone talking to somebody while you're playing a game.
[26:16.33]And they're trying to talk to you, and you just let them talk.
[26:20.11]You let them just fucking rifle off a hundred sentences.
[26:24.58]And you're just like, yup.
[26:27.02]Yup.
[26:27.34]He's like, what do you think about that?
[26:32.07]And you have no fucking idea what the hell they were even saying.
[26:34.91]Not a clue.
[26:36.53]And you're trying to reach so desperately to find out what you could even say to make it sound like you were even remotely paying attention.
[26:43.74]Yeah, um, that's pretty, no, that's like pretty, uh, that's pretty good news.
[26:50.68]I just got a fucking car accident.
[26:52.72]What are you talking about?
[26:53.48]No, no, I'm saying like, um, that like you, it wasn't your fault, so like your insurance probably won't go up.
[27:00.16]So that's like the cerebral lining, I guess.
[27:04.55]Best friend, what is this?
[27:10.73]Best friend.
[27:14.20]Look, I'm going to the Isaac Cheat Sheet for this one.
[27:17.26]Okay, best friend.
[27:21.64]I've never seen this item.
[27:24.54]I just clicked on a fucking ad.
[27:26.18]God damn it.
[27:33.29]Best friend.
[27:34.51]Places a decoy on the floor which attracts enemies and explodes after a period of time.
[27:37.39]When it explodes, there's a hundred... Okay.
[27:40.67]The fuck did I just do?
[27:42.25]No.
[27:42.77]Turn that off.
[27:46.50]Okay, that sucks.
[27:48.82]I mean, it might be kind of good, but... Get an item description mod?
[27:56.45]No, it's more fun to look it up.
[27:58.47]Because I like to be challenged to use a separate device to go to a different website to click on a fucking ad.
[28:07.42]So, no, I like to... I like to challenge.
[28:14.53]Hold on.
[28:19.94]I'm too lazy to do what you're saying, to like quit the game and go to Steam Workshop and do that for like the next few minutes.
[28:39.07]Just tell Siri to look it up for me.
[28:40.59]Does Siri, does that work?
[28:43.99]Alright, did we miss any tinted rocks?
[28:46.69]No, no, no, no.
[28:48.33]There's no way that works.
[28:52.71]Like, hey, Siri.
[28:55.21]What does the item... I kind of don't want to do that, though, because it's like, hey, Siri, what does Mom's tampon do?
[29:02.83]Well, Jeremy!
[29:04.33]Um... You see... Alright, there's nothing here.
[29:20.49]Blighted.
[29:20.93]Alright, no more mistakes, man.
[29:27.40]Ooh, he almost touched me.
[29:33.45]Thank you, Super Milk.
[29:40.23]This is the run now.
[29:41.19]This is the one.
[29:43.88]It's me.
[29:51.69]Oh, super milk!
[29:56.01]It's the super frog voice for those of you that are not paying attention.
[30:01.15]Curse of the Giant?
[30:04.91]What does that do?
[30:06.77]What's Curse of the Giant?
[30:09.71]Bikes on the ground.
[30:10.37]The fuck?
[30:19.15]Dude, what the fuck?
[30:21.77]That was fucking ridiculous.
[30:24.53]What?
[30:25.25]That's like not even doable.
[30:27.39]That's not even- you can't even beat that one.
[30:29.28]Holy shit.
[30:33.20]You can't even beat that one.
[30:34.74]It's the nature of the game, you know what I mean?
[30:36.18]It's the nature of the game.
[30:36.88]Just restart.
[30:38.58]That was good.
[30:41.20]I promise I will get to the third floor tonight.
[30:48.62]That was insane.
[30:50.58]People just running around with a bucket.
[30:51.88]They were going so fast.
[30:53.33]What does Curse of the Giant even do?
[30:56.33]Curse of the Get Fucked is what somebody said.
[31:02.93]It's all big rooms, okay.
[31:04.81]That makes sense.
[31:06.28]That's insane.
[31:08.62]They were all champions.
[31:15.72]Give me something good.
[31:19.09]Oh, don't!
[31:19.57]I'm so bad at these.
[31:20.31]I hate these fires.
[31:21.31]They really get me every time.
[31:30.27]Mine.
[31:30.63]Okay, good.
[31:33.15]Is it sour, please?
[31:33.91]Yeah, it's a pretty good song.
[31:36.19]It's pretty good.
[31:37.21]I like it.
[31:42.67]I like the, uh... I like this mod's
[31:52.18]Hold on, sorry.
[31:53.36]Don't, don't, don't tell anybody.
[31:54.52]Don't, don't, like, tell me any, like, bad news right now.
[31:56.87]Alright, now I can focus.
[31:58.15]Toxic blood.
[31:59.19]Bad.
[31:59.55]Okay, so, uh, what was I saying?
[32:04.37]I don't even remember.
[32:04.95]I have no idea what I was saying.
[32:06.19]I don't even remember.
[32:07.87]See, I'm on the phone with myself.
[32:10.41]And I don't even remember what I just said.
[32:13.01]To me.
[32:13.42]I have two, I have, like, I have a phone upside down next to one ear and right side up on the other one.
[32:21.49]I don't even know what I just said to myself.
[32:35.20]Yes, the gamer brain.
[32:40.80]Oh, right, the music.
[32:41.68]Okay, so... I like...
[32:45.46]I like this mod's title screen music more than any of the other.
[32:50.13]That's gonna explode.
[32:51.83]More than any of the other Isaac expansions or musics or original game.
[32:56.39]I like this one the most.
[33:01.83]This is kind of a shitty start as well.
[33:06.51]I like the title screen of this.
[33:07.61]That's objectively wrong?
[33:13.85]The fuck?
[33:15.68]Oh, no.
[33:16.06]Not this one.
[33:17.68]The hardest first boss.
[33:20.38]Don't make excuses.
[33:23.35]I want to see somebody say, holy shit, how's he not getting hit?
[33:32.59]No.
[33:36.97]Body blocked him.
[33:37.53]I did that on purpose.
[33:39.15]I know I have a heart over there.
[33:39.93]See?
[33:41.33]I did that on fucking purpose.
[33:43.23]Damaging HP up.
[33:43.93]That's good.
[33:44.23]Alright, we got hearts over here.
[33:45.11]We got a heart over here.
[33:45.61]I did that on purpose.
[33:46.09]I body blocked him so he wouldn't be able to hit me twice.
[33:48.70]If I didn't stand in that spot and get hit by that, he would have hit me twice.
[34:01.11]Speak words?
[34:01.85]What are you talking about?
[34:02.39]I said body block.
[34:04.80]What do you think I said?
[34:05.47]Like, body wash?
[34:06.71]What are you talking about?
[34:16.19]I'm very bad at this game.
[34:18.32]And make excuses for every time I get hit by an enemy.
[34:29.28]Oh, by the way, in case you didn't know.
[34:44.96]Alright, I wasn't even looking.
[34:49.94]I didn't understand, but +2 anyways.
[34:58.10]Good effort.
[34:59.00]Alright, I hate these little things.
[35:00.32]I need a key.
[35:09.86]I need bombs too.
[35:22.20]I hate them.
[35:22.52]When they turn into the meat chunks, it's the worst.
[35:24.16]Because they come back.
[35:26.65]This guy had a coin, right?
[35:32.69]Or a battery?
[35:33.93]Oh, yeah, a coin.
[35:35.03]Don't pick that up unless I need it.
[35:36.15]Alright, this guy's gonna shoot out.
[35:49.42]Yeah, I know what you do now.
[35:53.11]I know what you fucking do now.
[35:56.19]Not going to trick me a third time.
[35:58.11]Let's go.
[36:00.49]Rock.
[36:00.71]I'll get the rock.
[36:07.00]Don't let them come over here.
[36:10.18]They all go in a straight line.
[36:11.64]I would get hit.
[36:16.82]I gotta get that.
[36:17.48]Okay, so, you guys, when I get to the point where I need to do a puzzle for the second knife piece, you gotta, like, I need to see spam.
[36:28.25]I need to see, like, attention, attention, attention.
[36:32.13]You need to say the word attention.
[36:35.59]When there's a knife piece that I can get.
[36:39.25]You have to get my attention.
[36:43.49]I'm not doing that.
[36:43.99]I don't have any keys.
[36:52.45]He missed a rock.
[36:53.45]I only have one bomb, though.
[36:54.57]And I need two.
[36:55.91]Hold on.
[36:59.62]Come on.
[36:59.80]Give me a key down here.
[37:01.62]Well, I... No keys.
[37:16.83]Yeah, I mean, I could go here.
[37:17.93]Should I blow up the... The heart guy over there?
[37:23.50]Or is it secret room left or right?
[37:25.05]What do you think?
[37:25.73]I need two bombs.
[37:26.69]Tinted rock.
[37:28.87]I could get a key out of the tinted rock, right?
[37:36.17]Attention!
[37:37.03]Attention!
[37:39.45]Donation guy, yeah.
[37:43.50]The rock could give... Well, let's see what happens.
[37:45.48]Let's take our chance.
[37:47.66]Well, good.
[37:49.90]Eh.
[37:51.16]Now what?
[37:51.68]Now I can't get the item in the second room.
[37:57.36]Attention all Fortnite gamers.
[38:02.93]Go to the sacrifice room.
[38:07.17]No, I'm going to lose all my hearts.
[38:10.57]Let me just kill this guy and see what happens.
[38:17.20]This is a bad room to fight this guy in.
[38:39.16]Alright, where are you?
[38:40.74]Wait!
[38:41.54]What the fuck?
[38:43.00]Holy shit!
[38:43.92]I didn't even know that was a pos... Oh, right.
[38:45.64]You wanted to push... Here, you wanted to push one into your lowest stat.
[38:49.96]Here you go.
[38:50.84]You're a lucky guy now.
[38:54.02]Oh, shit.
[38:54.40]Wait a minute.
[38:55.56]That's not... How is that not... Why is that my lowest stat?
[39:02.19]Isn't luck my lowest stat?
[39:03.93]Alright, now I'm going to sacrifice a bunch of hearts to this guy.
[39:15.20]Give me some shit.
[39:16.48]Give me something.
[39:19.49]Beggar, the beggar.
[39:20.15]Yeah, this guy.
[39:20.79]No, I don't want the coin beggar.
[39:22.33]I want this guy.
[39:24.12]This guy's gonna help me out.
[39:58.89]You can use him twice for one.
[40:02.03]Well, I don't know.
[40:03.25]I don't know the exploit.
[40:09.09]Secret room.
[40:09.93]But I need a bomb.
[40:15.92]Do I take my chances?
[40:20.56]Do I take my chances and give him the rest of these hearts?
[40:28.10]The coin beggar.
[40:28.94]Where's this coin beggar you're talking about?
[40:33.20]Is he on the other side?
[40:34.04]Is he up here?
[40:35.19]Oh, he's... Oh, fuck, yeah, he is.
[40:36.83]No, this is gonna be all my money!
[40:38.61]Alright, I'm gonna get... Here, take it all.
[40:51.58]Ray!
[40:54.72]Take... Here!
[40:57.04]Come on!
[40:58.33]No, not another fucking card!
[41:00.53]Do it again.
[41:01.79]Again.
[41:07.93]What the fuck is this?
[41:09.68]A lighter.
[41:18.80]You have to reset now.
[41:23.87]Just reset now.
[41:25.01]No, I can't just reset.
[41:26.81]No, that's the nature of the game, but just... Any more coins lying around?
[41:32.56]Somebody look under that couch.
[41:33.80]Is there any more coins?
[41:38.84]No, no, I'm not holding down R. I'm not doing it.
[41:40.78]I got the world.
[41:41.38]I'm going.
[41:44.53]I'm not holding down R. I'm not resetting.
[41:46.53]Hold R, buddy.
[41:47.59]No.
[41:48.33]Look.
[41:49.39]There's things I can't do.
[41:59.26]Whatever, just... Shit, I need to do like a fucking run.
[42:03.99]I keep getting in trouble.
[42:19.44]Okay, well easy, easy, easy.
[42:32.87]I need a key.
[42:33.73]It's salvageable.
[42:36.07]This is salvageable, as long as... Key.
[42:40.45]Take a room.
[42:44.86]I need two bombs, though.
[42:45.88]Whatever.
[42:46.20]You gotta take a chance.
[42:50.06]Okay.
[42:52.52]So I blow up the... I need two bombs.
[42:55.14]That's not worth it.
[42:56.50]If I get a key, I'll be okay.
[42:58.51]It's salvageable.
[43:08.41]What's left?
[43:08.83]What's left?
[43:12.29]I got three bombs now.
[43:15.81]Go do the left room.
[43:18.25]Secret room.
[43:19.81]He is inside of you.
[43:34.60]Ah.
[43:37.85]Blow this up, right?
[43:39.66]Blow this up.
[43:41.90]And then I go down and let's hope it's a cool item.
[43:44.34]No, it just skips the level.
[43:50.49]It's not a ladder.
[43:53.51]Sleep in the bed.
[43:54.43]Minus one bomb.
[43:57.43]No, don't tell me to hold down R. R.
[44:06.58]Look, can I open the door from here?
[44:08.53]The door's unlocked now, right?
[44:09.61]Yeah, I can walk out and unlock it.
[44:13.51]Hey, well, look at this.
[44:14.47]I can skip.
[44:15.27]Just give me a key and this can be salvageable.
[44:21.65]What does the fighter do?
[44:27.38]Oh, fuck these enemies.
[44:29.46]Oh, fuck you.
[44:32.00]Got it.
[44:34.11]Bomb the Beggar.
[44:35.65]I don't want to do that yet.
[44:38.19]I need two bombs, remember?
[44:40.53]I need two bombs to get the heck out of here.
[44:45.02]Okay.
[44:47.78]Run saved, I think.
[44:54.30]Run saved.
[44:58.22]Yeah.
[45:00.21]Should we get a translation?
[45:02.07]You know the drill.
[45:02.63]I don't know what either of these two things do.
[45:12.08]It hurts.
[45:12.50]No, it doesn't.
[45:20.90]Okay.
[45:25.88]I guess it doesn't hurt.
[45:31.99]Bomb into the shop?
[45:32.81]No, I need two bombs.
[45:35.73]If I bomb into the shop, I'm going to lose a bomb.
[45:39.27]You're playing on keyboard, I'm playing on controller.
[45:51.98]What do you mean, ew?
[45:57.12]It's like a top-down shooter game.
[46:00.28]I'm going to play on...
[46:02.23]Can we move the keyboard?
[46:03.55]No, my fingers will hurt.
[46:04.61]It'll hurt my fingers.
[46:06.71]I've tried it before.
[46:07.37]Alright, what's this shit?
[46:11.33]Ooh, it's a knife piece.
[46:12.55]Got it.
[46:12.95]Okay.
[46:13.41]I can't even use this because I don't have any bombs.
[46:26.76]I know, I got the knife.
[46:27.46]You don't have to do attention.
[46:28.42]I don't have any bombs, so this is over.
[46:32.54]That was fun.
[46:34.56]Maybe if I blow up the beggar, he'll drop a double bomb.
[46:48.64]Going to the shop.
[46:49.30]Alright, but I have three coins.
[46:53.18]Boss could give bombs.
[46:54.28]Alright, we'll try that.
[47:01.59]If I skip the level, is that gonna... Alright, I need some Isaac veterans here to tell me.
[47:06.69]If I skip the level, will it bring me to the anti-birth level or just go to the normal level?
[47:13.06]I don't know.
[47:13.40]This is the first time I've ever seen this boss rainmaker.
[47:21.83]Not that bad so far.
[47:24.71]Oh, that is...
[47:32.95]Tears and shots beat up.
[47:33.93]It's too bad, because look at how good this is now.
[47:38.77]It goes to the normal level.
[47:41.26]But you have the opportunity again on the next one, really.
[47:43.68]Fuck.
[47:47.66]That's just more damage.
[47:48.96]But I don't think I have enough hearts for that.
[48:04.56]I have two?
[48:04.98]This is just a waste of time.
[48:15.08]Okay, so we're gonna bomb the beggar and see if he drops two bombs.

[53:34.55]What does it do?
[53:43.26]It's good.
[53:43.92]Hmm.
[53:44.62]Maybe I should listen to that version.
[53:47.22]I'm not touching it.
[54:04.50]Chat is mental.
[54:05.66]What?
[54:10.89]Ah!
[54:11.07]God damn it.
[54:11.61]It's alright.
[54:14.28]I didn't know that's what that... I didn't know that's what those things did.
[54:33.68]No tinted rocks.
[54:34.50]How have there been no rocks tinted?
[54:38.41]This is XL.
[54:41.99]Why are you guys beeping?
[54:55.59]What's the beat?
[54:56.13]I don't understand.
[54:59.74]Stop destroying the rocks.
[55:01.04]I have to.
[55:01.44]The rock could be in here.
[55:04.44]Got one.
[55:04.76]Oh, wait.
[55:08.20]I... Sometimes... Hey.
[55:11.56]What's that old saying?
[55:13.59]Scared money don't make money.
[55:34.83]Oh, no.
[55:35.53]No, hide.
[55:36.09]Hide.
[55:36.29]Just hide.
[55:39.89]I'm safe in here.
[55:40.51]In my fucking fort!
[55:41.67]Go the other way!
[55:42.33]Dig the other way!
[55:42.85]Dig the other way!
[55:43.31]Dig the other way!
[55:44.11]Dig the other way!
[55:44.63]Is that it?
[55:54.91]Is it over?
[55:56.80]I don't know.
[55:57.32]I can't tell.
[55:58.54]Oh, shit.
[55:58.98]It's just like Minecraft.
[56:00.84]Should I dig up?
[56:02.50]No, Jerma.
[56:02.98]Don't dig up ever.
[56:05.59]I'm gonna dig into a bomb, I know it.
[56:07.13]Is it gonna be like going into lava?
[56:13.30]Is it open?
[56:13.74]The door's open?
[56:15.62]It's over.
[56:15.98]Okay, hold on.
[56:16.48]Let's just break every rock.
[56:30.86]What?
[56:31.10]What?
[56:31.26]What?
[56:31.38]What?
[56:31.52]What?
[56:31.70]What?
[56:31.88]What?
[56:32.10]What?
[56:32.30]What's going on?
[56:34.60]Was I not supposed to do that?
[56:38.28]Oh, don't do the attention thing!
[56:44.09]That's only for when I have to do the secret to do the final boss.
[56:50.83]Oh, shh.
[56:53.05]Ow, fuck, that hurt.
[56:56.23]Okay, let's go.
[56:57.65]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[56:59.61]Don't break it.
[57:02.09]Yeah, but how do we know if there's any secrets?
[57:20.83]Don't put that down.
[57:26.39]What do I do?
[57:30.68]Okay.
[57:32.08]It's where the pebbles are.
[57:34.78]The order with the pebbles.
[57:35.76]So top.
[57:36.50]Okay.
[57:36.82]It's the pebble order.
[57:40.64]So this one first.
[57:41.56]Top right.
[57:42.56]Bottom right.
[57:43.50]Top left.
[57:44.19]Bottom left.
[57:48.07]Got it.
[57:59.32]Knife piece number two.
[58:03.34]And a tinted rock.
[58:04.04]Fuck you.
[58:06.59]There's a monster in there.
[58:08.79]Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[58:13.85]Okay, I got both pieces.
[58:15.67]The last piece is with the fire.
[58:17.93]It's gonna get there.
[58:18.75]I need a key.
[58:20.19]Okay, let's go.
[58:30.34]You just got jumpscared by a rock.
[58:32.30]Do the mushroom.
[58:33.16]Oh man, I should have listened to you an hour ago.
[58:50.09]There's probably a tinted rock in here somewhere.
[58:56.70]No.
[58:58.74]Yup.
[59:02.62]There's the key.
[59:04.96]Hey, what's that old saying?
[59:06.20]Hey, what's that old saying?
[59:27.57]It's in a BB unit?
[59:29.43]No.
[59:32.40]Go back and get Tammy's head.
[59:34.94]I don't want Tammy's head.
[59:36.52]I want the Book of Belial.
[59:39.97]Hey, what's the old saying, you know?
[59:41.65]Yeah, that's the one.
[59:46.25]Tammy's head is good.
[59:47.23]I know, but... Is it as good as being able to have, like, maximum damage?
[60:09.63]Just use Tammy's head.
[60:10.97]You know what?
[60:12.64]Yeah.
[60:13.94]I'm gonna use Tammy's head temporarily.
[60:17.40]Because I can use it every room.
[60:20.84]What's with the beep?
[60:21.40]Stop beeping.
[60:21.90]Why are you guys beeping?
[60:42.23]I'm beeping.
[60:42.75]What do you mean, I'm beeping?
[60:47.03]There's the key for the, uh... Oh, it's the song.
[60:51.76]Okay, any... any tinted rocks?
[60:55.94]Do you see any?
[60:56.62]Attention.
[61:03.49]Use the head.
[61:04.01]What do you use for the head?
[61:27.85]Where are I?
[61:28.19]Hey, yo!
[61:30.09]Okay.
[61:31.71]Tinted rocks.
[61:40.64]I don't see any.
[61:42.28]Alright, we need... There's another... We're gonna go to the shop.
[61:47.80]It's time for the shop.
[61:50.18]I also need... I don't know.
[62:01.30]Alright, important.
[62:03.18]I think I'm going to buy the spirit heart.
[62:05.46]I'm also going to buy the map.
[62:13.03]Full visible map.
[62:17.12]Nice.
[62:24.90]Is it tinted rock?
[62:25.80]No.
[62:27.59]Okay, I need the other... I need the other room.
[62:38.38]Jesus Christ!
[62:40.00]Okay.
[62:40.94]Hey, do that... Alright, it's just a pattern.
[62:44.76]What's the dice guy do?
[62:52.35]Um... One of these, I think, is just money, and the other one is... I don't know.
[63:03.80]Which one of the... Isn't that like just a bunch of money?
[63:07.99]Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[63:09.15]All stats up is right.
[63:10.25]Are you serious?
[63:15.39]Oh my god.
[63:17.55]I'm guaranteed victory.
[63:19.26]Guaranteed to win.
[63:20.80]And I'm gonna beat that fucking bot.
[63:25.80]Don't forget about this.
[63:27.04]Okay, now I can go down.
[63:28.34]Let's...
[63:29.86]Ooh, yeah.
[63:30.67]Fucking idiot, there's a bug.
[63:37.25]This is looking real good.
[63:38.63]I just can't fuck up the fire thing.
[63:40.07]Mushroom.
[63:48.20]Fire.
[63:51.24]This is good damage so far.
[63:53.28]Good, good tears up.
[63:59.31]Don't touch that thing.
[64:01.43]Don't even go.
[64:02.05]Don't.
[64:02.47]Jeremy, don't even think about it.
[64:04.38]We're good.
[64:04.80]Let's go.
[64:15.18]I must have just fooled me.
[64:16.09]Here we go.
[64:22.35]Wait.
[64:24.13]Wait.
[64:26.08]Attention.
[64:26.89]Attention.
[64:27.71]I need the book of Belial.
[64:30.37]That's correct.
[64:31.69]Yes.
[64:32.61]I'll go get it.
[64:34.35]Attention.
[64:35.03]Attention, gamer.
[64:37.01]Where is it?
[64:37.43]Up here?
[64:37.99]Where did I leave it?
[64:41.72]Two bosses in a row.
[64:42.58]Yep.
[64:43.26]And then we'll deposit two hearts and we get to get to the end game.
[64:48.74]Where is this fucking thing?
[64:49.68]Oh, it's down here.
[65:01.87]I'm not going to use the book until the second boss.
[65:06.31]That's the smart play.
[65:08.31]That's the play that gets you into the big leagues.
[65:12.68]Challenge room?
[65:14.94]I don't think so.
[65:17.08]I don't think so.
[65:18.48]I don't think I want to do that.
[65:19.20]I don't think I want to do that.
[65:22.28]That's a teeth room.
[65:24.28]No, I don't want to do it.
[65:25.00]I don't want to do it.
[65:25.96]I'm not doing it.
[65:27.56]No, it might be good.
[65:28.14]I don't want to do it.
[65:29.68]I'm a coward.
[65:30.40]I'm a coward.
[65:37.35]This guy, this is a bad place to fight him.
[65:41.46]Clear it, clear it, clear it, clear it.
[66:24.38]Bad item.
[66:26.12]Very bad item.
[66:46.62]Just feed him through.
[66:48.08]Look at how good this is at this boss.
[66:49.98]This build was made to kill this boss.
[66:56.43]What's that?
[66:59.59]Don't usually have to blow that thing up.
[67:01.61]That was a hard counter.
[67:02.71]Was it soap?
[67:08.66]Don't pick that up.
[67:13.82]Tears and shots beat up.
[67:16.02]Oh my god!
[67:21.25]Let's go.
[67:22.39]Let's go.
[67:22.77]Any tainted rocks?
[67:26.06]I don't see any.
[67:28.88]No, right?
[67:31.56]Yeah, OK, cool.
[67:33.98]Deposit.
[67:41.52]What the hell is this again?
[67:53.64]Just take it.
[67:54.34]Don't question it.
[67:55.08]Okay.
[67:56.56]Don't question the run.
[67:57.26]Yeah, alright, I'm ready to go.
[67:59.60]Don't let me fuck this up.
[68:01.62]It regens after every run.
[68:02.66]Well, that's incredible.
[68:03.66]Don't let me mess this up.
[68:05.17]When we go down here... I'm gonna have chat attached to the bottom of my fucking eyelids, so when I blink, I see what you're writing.
[68:34.00]This is so good.
[68:38.15]Just don't ever shoot a fire.
[68:39.51]Yep.
[68:43.59]And no Kylo Ren impressions for the rest of the day.
[68:56.66]Who am I kidding?
[69:05.07]Should I get this?
[69:14.89]It's better than the lighter.
[69:18.79]That's what makes chests red.
[69:20.27]EW!

[70:24.82]That's double shot!
[70:27.80]No?
[70:28.28]Oh, it's not.
[70:30.47]It's x-ray vision.
[70:34.91]It's still good though.
[70:35.89]It's better than the floating eyeball.
[70:42.74]Oh, I thought that was double shot.
[70:43.76]I was gonna say this is over if it was.
[70:49.21]Strength.
[70:50.35]The world.
[70:50.79]Does that really matter?
[70:54.73]I guess I'm just... I can know where everything is.
[70:58.52]There it is.
[70:59.16]Okay, alright.
[71:02.52]We're gonna carry around strength.
[71:04.96]The boss.

[72:24.79]Okay, I can go over here, though.
[72:28.01]There's no fires in here.
[72:36.39]This is free stuff.
[72:38.39]Oh my god.
[72:39.91]Jackpot.
[72:47.95]Oh my god.
[72:50.06]Is that an item?
[72:51.12]Is this an item?
[72:53.22]Oh, okay.
[72:53.66]No, I thought it was a pedestal.
[72:56.84]I was like, oh, wow.
[72:58.64]Cool.
[73:03.28]Death.
[73:04.80]Strength.
[73:06.73]Death.
[73:11.75]Death!
[73:20.28]What the fuck?!
[73:20.88]That just scared the shit out of me.
[73:32.88]Yeah, dead.
[73:34.08]But I have plus one.
[73:48.90]Dead.
[73:50.60]Yeah, dead.
[73:51.02]Ooh.
[74:01.65]Shot speed and full health.
[74:04.77]I take every pill without even looking at whatever the thing is on the label.
[74:09.80]Here we go.
[74:10.58]I'm going to go up.
[74:12.70]I've got to find this secret room.
[74:23.10]That's a lot of bombs.
[74:26.00]And if we get the third piece, I get the knife.
[74:31.28]Go up.
[74:35.60]Okay.
[74:36.96]Uh.
[74:44.28]Attention.
[74:44.88]Remember, there are signs over the map that correspond to signs on... What?
[74:51.35]What?
[74:52.44]On the puzzle?
[74:56.42]Press this.
[74:57.14]Attention gamer, attention!
[75:05.79]Why did that just happen?
[75:16.38]No, I don't want it.
[75:17.52]I'm good.
[75:22.59]I do need a key or something, right?
[75:27.14]Wait a minute.
[75:29.94]I gotta get over there.
[75:33.28]Do the challenge.
[75:33.90]You're a coward.
[75:34.92]You have max health.
[75:37.68]Yeah, but this is not a point for me to get cocky and do dumb things that I know I'm not capable of.
[75:42.22]I'm capable of it.
[75:42.95]Let's do it.
[75:44.33]Fuck yeah, let's go.
[76:06.53]Ooh, there's a third.
[76:09.59]Oh, this is wicked fucking easy.
[76:11.01]I don't even need that heart.
[76:19.31]Not a key, though.
[76:31.35]So, am I in trouble here?
[76:32.61]Because I can't get over this?
[76:36.11]Buy a key from the shop.
[76:38.73]Oh, I need to buy a key.
[76:45.18]Bomb the spikes.
[76:46.58]Knife pieces next floor.
[76:48.02]Break the spikes.
[76:49.16]Oh, I can just shoot the rocks.
[76:52.22]Shoot the rocks.
[76:58.88]Okay.
[76:59.00]Okay.
[77:09.23]Step on them at random?
[77:11.39]I need a key, though.
[77:12.53]I'm just so paranoid because I don't know what to do.
[77:15.58]Touch the button.
[77:18.32]I'm going to buy a key.
[77:19.58]This is not a puzzle.
[77:21.66]This has nothing to do with a piece.
[77:32.49]Okay.
[77:32.97]Well, fucking who cares?
[77:33.79]I'll go buy a key.
[77:41.94]I don't have any... Well, I'm gonna blow this up.
[78:04.75]Stop it!
[78:06.17]What?
[78:07.27]I want at least 15 bucks, man.
[78:15.75]I'm not throwing this run down the toilet.
[78:19.47]Alright, let's go do this.
[78:27.23]Okay.
[78:27.55]So we're looking for... Let's open this.
[78:40.54]Okay.
[78:43.31]Alrighty, let's go.
[78:45.03]Well, I got plenty of health everywhere.
[78:47.56]It surrounds me.
[79:15.50]This motherfucker just spams at you, huh?
[79:24.43]My god!
[79:43.10]Dude, I just... I can just take hits.
[79:45.00]Who cares, man?
[79:46.26]Hit me.
[79:47.28]Hit me.
[79:57.75]Missed a rock.
[79:58.27]We'll get it on the way back.
[80:07.91]Whoa, his brain popped out of his skull.
[80:26.24]Wasn't there a, uh... Wasn't there a game, an old board game, where you pulled boogers out of a person's nose until their brain popped out of their head?
[80:37.83]What the fuck is wrong with that?
[80:39.85]Why?
[80:40.47]What was the point of that?
[80:43.10]Yeah, there's a board game where you pull boogers.
[80:45.76]Gooey Louie.
[80:46.66]You pull boogers out of a guy's nose until his brain fucking rockets out of his skull and you kill him.
[80:59.23]I'll play it on stream, yeah.
[81:09.32]No, dude, you know what?
[81:10.68]Fuck it.
[81:11.94]Okay, I'll get all the old fucking shitty board games.
[81:14.64]Play them all.
[81:17.90]I'm talking about, like, Slobber and Sam.
[81:20.08]Mm-hmm.
[81:22.44]Post it here.
[81:23.38]Count it.
[81:29.42]Oh, he walked into a fucking fire.
[81:30.79]Two spades.
[81:32.73]I'll take some fucking free shit.
[81:39.97]What's the game with the ice?
[81:42.63]Where you like... And you don't want to break the ice?
[81:46.37]I think it's called Don't Break the Ice.
[81:47.85]I think that's what it's called.
[82:03.53]Play it on stream.
[82:04.43]I'll do them all.
[82:07.63]Don't wake daddy?
[82:08.79]Mm-hmm.
[82:18.92]It's gonna be a complete fuckface stream.
[82:22.97]Alright, what's this rock you guys talking about?
[82:24.69]What's this rock?
[82:36.45]Elephun the elephant.
[82:43.16]Down.
[82:48.66]I can't even hold them all.
[82:56.26]What was that one?
[82:56.78]Mr. Bucket.
[82:59.85]I got all the balls in my mouth.
[83:01.55]I'm Mr. Bucket.
[83:02.19]Out of my mouth I'll go pop.
[83:04.75]I'll get that one too.
[83:14.41]What's this?
[83:16.13]Oh, good thing I don't have very many of those.
[83:18.55]Another one of these!
[83:19.29]I don't want that.
[83:30.37]They have melee.
[83:36.90]Mouse trap?
[83:39.10]Mouse trap?
[83:39.54]Okay.
[83:40.82]I will play mouse trap, but...
[83:43.93]It's gonna be a scenario where I don't even play the game.
[83:46.01]I just set the trap up.
[83:47.05]This is what everybody did.
[83:47.85]I used to have that game when I was younger.
[83:50.39]When I was a kid.
[83:51.55]But I don't even know how that game works.
[83:53.39]I've never played it.
[83:54.96]I just set the traps up and then just play with them and put the mouse in it and stuff and have the Rube Goldberg machine happen.
[84:00.26]I don't even know how that game works.
[84:03.90]Has anybody actually even played that game once?
[84:07.32]To the point where they've... What is this?
[84:09.00]Key?
[84:12.33]It feels lucky.
[84:18.18]I mean... I mean, this is kind of bad, I think.
[84:22.62]Keep the lighter instead.
[84:24.56]Watch the world burn.
[84:25.80]I actually did and it fucking sucks.
[84:34.79]Keep the key!
[84:35.67]Keep the key!
[84:36.41]Keep the key!
[84:37.03]I gotta look it up on my fucking Binding of Isaac.
[84:38.94]What do I do?
[84:39.58]Cheat sheet.
[84:41.10]What's it called?
[84:41.66]The key?
[84:52.10]It looks like it... Rusty.
[84:57.17]Gives Isaac a higher chance to find keys and chests.
[85:00.65]Yeah, that's way better.
[85:01.51]What does a lighter do?
[85:02.65]A lighter.
[85:03.09]No, not laughter iPad.
[85:13.30]Lighter.
[85:17.93]Chance for enemies to burn when entering a room.
[85:22.33]Hmm.
[85:27.31]Hmm.
[85:30.06]Am I going to need keys?
[85:31.38]Yeah, let's go do it.
[85:37.58]I'd rather have that.
[85:38.22]The enemies burn.
[85:39.16]Look at my damage.
[85:39.82]What's wrong with my character?
[85:44.66]Why is my character all fucked up?
[85:56.22]Go into the curse room.
[85:59.23]Go in the curse room.
[86:00.19]Fine, it's free.
[86:03.11]I'll take it if it's free.
[86:14.94]Did you do the puzzle?
[86:15.62]The puzzle is in the next floor.
[86:16.84]That's what I've been screamed at.
[86:28.76]Okay, is this a... is there a heart?
[86:30.78]There's one in the regular room.
[86:35.74]Puzzle is next floor, yeah.
[86:43.38]Alright, take me back.
[86:49.77]It's time.
[86:54.01]Let's go.
[86:55.59]I'm gonna save the... I'll use the book, but... No, whatever.
[86:59.87]Who am I fighting?
[87:02.91]Siren.
[87:03.59]This is new.
[87:06.07]Probably gonna give her a chance.
[87:20.42]Where am I?
[87:20.72]That was weird.
[87:27.10]And that is speed and shot speed up.
[87:30.94]What do we got in the devil room?
[87:34.05]Don't want it.
[87:35.65]Although I guess I could just take it.
[87:39.37]It's going to end up being just free because I'm going to be at infinite hearts.
[87:48.20]No, it's fucking useless.
[87:49.34]You're right.
[87:51.02]Blow up her skull.
[87:53.48]What?
[87:58.89]Oh no, I didn't do it.
[87:59.92]Fuck, too late.
[88:01.80]Might as well restart the whole thing.
[88:11.43]Okay, this is important.
[88:13.01]This place is huge.
[88:14.59]I have to be careful.
[88:24.13]Temperance.
[88:24.91]Okay, this is just a blood donation machine.
[88:27.79]Just blow it up.
[88:32.70]Lucky toe has appeared in the basement.
[88:34.96]Bouquet.
[88:35.84]Money.
[88:37.60]And the love is just hearts.
[88:39.89]So we're just gonna... we're gonna put these down on the ground?
[88:44.13]We'll come back if we need them for any reason.
[88:53.77]Nice keys.
[88:56.47]I can't believe I got hit.
[88:57.31]I might as well fucking never stream again.
[89:03.24]Use the teleporter?
[89:14.62]I got fucking hit.
[89:15.38]I might as well eat a shoe on stream.
[89:28.50]Oh shit, hold on.
[89:33.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[89:35.01]This is, uh, this is gonna, this is, this is really fucking crazy.
[89:40.37]The bottom one, from what I remember, makes your tears fire.
[89:44.88]And they can fucking explode.
[89:46.26]That might be a little too risky.
[89:55.36]It hurts me, too.
[89:57.59]Top one is safer.
[90:00.25]Explode and kill you.
[90:02.32]I'm going top.
[90:04.38]Knockout.
[90:04.90]Yep, this is the... Whoa.
[90:14.14]That's cool looking.
[90:15.02]It actually flies out.
[90:15.83]A hand flies out.
[90:22.67]What do I do?
[90:23.79]Is this it?
[90:30.44]No.
[90:47.37]Wait, what did I do that for?
[91:01.79]Can I?
[91:10.11]That move is so cool.
[91:12.28]There's a heart there.
[91:16.46]Ow... Oh, I walked into it.
[91:19.12]I walked into it.
[91:19.92]I walked into it.
[91:20.82]It's okay.
[91:21.28]Plenty of... plenty of healing.
[91:35.47]Ooh.
[91:36.93]I'll take them both.
[91:39.62]Ooh.
[91:41.00]Answers.
[91:41.74]Vision.
[91:42.24]Do it.
[91:48.98]Now I have the world.
[91:50.78]Oh.
[91:52.53]Okay, well, I know I'm not going this way.
[91:53.99]Let's go over here.
[91:54.53]I want to go into the shop.
[92:05.40]Oh my god, this is just the shop for free, but I already went in there.
[92:13.41]None of this shit is even necessary.
[92:18.28]Let's just put the money back.
[92:19.34]Alright, 500.
[92:23.32]Take the pill.
[92:33.92]Shot speed down.
[92:34.70]Ban every person that's said to take that pill.
[92:37.42]For at least two to three minutes.
[92:39.66]At least.
[92:40.02]Ooh.
[92:58.01]Come on.
[92:59.55]Come on.
[93:01.01]Come on.
[93:03.89]Ah, just a net loss.
[93:05.39]Great.
[93:05.87]Thank you.
[93:06.29]Okay, the stars.
[93:13.09]That's just a shop.
[93:17.00]Go donate.
[93:17.76]No!
[93:19.42]I might need this money.
[93:31.29]What's going on?
[93:31.83]Why did- Hey!
[93:33.93]It's supposed to blow it out!
[93:34.79]Is this it?
[94:00.83]Is this it?
[94:01.41]Is this it?
[94:01.83]Is this it?
[94:04.30]I see two... I see fires in a room with no enemies.
[94:09.71]Don't... I'm not gonna put out any fires.
[94:16.73]Do I have to put out any of these fires?
[94:21.47]You know how it looks.
[94:22.47]Why are you asking?
[94:23.49]I... I don't know.
[94:24.49]Because I'm fucking nervous.
[94:26.13]I'm stupid.
[94:31.13]Mom's pearl.
[94:33.71]Meh.
[94:40.15]Keeping the key.
[94:44.35]Nah, I'll keep the pearl.
[94:45.19]That's more soul hearts.
[94:47.02]That's more soul hearts, yeah.
[94:50.24]Oh my god.
[94:53.24]Okay, good.
[95:07.51]What the fuck?
[95:11.18]I'm just, I'm un-fucking-killable.
[95:18.04]I don't lose.
[95:21.64]Unless I accidentally blow out a wrong fire, which at that point, I'd be very upset with myself.
[95:26.86]Remember how this one started, where it was, like, guaranteed I was not gonna be able to do it?
[95:35.30]Fuck.
[95:42.89]I just punched through all three of those guys.
[95:47.03]That was insane.
[95:47.91]I wish I had more luck.
[95:58.12]He punched that guy's brain out.
[96:03.54]Oh, I didn't even see it.
[96:04.42]Oh, I didn't even see it.
[96:07.20]Alright, I gotta be careful here.
[96:23.44]Attention gamer, there's a rock.
[96:26.20]Attention, rock.
[96:30.58]Where do you see a rock?
[96:33.64]Where is there a rock?
[96:34.46]What are you guys talking about?
[96:35.63]Where?
[96:38.51]Is there a rock?
[96:40.47]In the left?
[96:48.01]Alright.
[96:52.16]He's blind.
[96:52.72]He's blind.
[96:53.32]He's blind.
[96:56.46]Okay.
[96:57.94]So where is the fire room?
[97:05.99]Where is it?
[97:21.52]A big room next to the boss?
[97:28.91]Zero!
[97:30.25]Don't touch any fires.
[97:32.43]Don't blow out any fires, no matter what.
[97:35.67]I don't care where they are.
[97:39.90]This one up here?
[98:05.54]Okay, so... Where is it?
[98:07.54]All the way to the right?
[98:12.86]Oh, I gotta do this shit again.
[98:16.79]Okay.
[98:39.57]Alright, this way?
[98:41.53]No?
[98:43.77]It's probably this one up here.
[98:48.52]But... Um... Just get it?
[98:57.91]Can I just take it?
[99:03.13]I can just take it.
[99:04.83]There's no fire puzzle.
[99:06.73]Just pick it up.
[99:07.51]There's no fire puzzle.
[99:09.13]Don't blow out any fires.
[99:10.17]Just pick it up.
[99:14.20]I got it.
[99:19.72]Alright, let's go.
[99:23.61]I got the knife.
[99:32.34]Now, is there anything special I have to do to get to this last area, or no?
[99:38.28]Just beat this boss, and then I get to go through another door.
[99:40.80]That's it.
[99:41.08]Okay.
[99:47.40]Let's go.
[99:59.73]Shit!
[100:00.71]Oh my god, it's stomping!
[100:08.20]We're good?
[100:11.94]Okay, I was supposed to do that.
[100:14.27]Do I pick up anything or just go?
[100:21.27]Pick up the Polaroid.
[100:27.58]Let's go!
[100:30.98]Mom's heart?
[100:34.14]What?
[100:35.40]Wait, what?
[100:40.56]Wait a minute, is this supposed to be happening?
[100:53.27]Oh my god, I just took like a fucking million damage.
[101:04.28]Do I leave?
[101:14.34]Okay.
[101:18.90]Oh, Jesus.
[101:25.30]Okay, so here's like the, here's the real, the real tunnel to the... Oh, God.
[101:36.35]I can't leave.
[101:36.91]I'm going in.
[101:43.85]This is... Rotten Heart has appeared in the basement.
[101:49.26]You're in corpse.
[101:50.76]Okay, I gotta play smart, because I need to fucking get some hearts.
[101:53.94]Okay, nothing there.
[102:14.56]Let's get some good shit in here.
[102:18.92]Good shit only.
[102:19.54]That's not good shit.
[102:22.42]That's not good shit either.
[102:25.83]Where am I going?
[102:29.75]In Krampus!
[102:32.59]Of all the assholes I didn't want to see right now, I don't want to see you.
[102:35.95]But I'll take the coal.
[102:42.45]Okay, back to what we were doing.
[102:57.73]Okay, good.
[102:59.00]Very good.
[103:03.70]Poop, wine, tears.
[103:05.90]Holy shit, okay.
[103:12.39]I'm gonna say down.
[103:28.44]Keep your distance.
[103:29.72]Keep your distance.
[103:41.21]Just don't let him come near you.
[103:42.15]Just knock him the fuck out.
[103:44.37]Okay, we're good.
[104:00.33]Oh my god, it's another one.
[104:04.21]Oh, okay.
[104:06.03]Can I destroy those?
[104:06.87]No.
[104:07.01]Well, it's obviously not over here.
[104:24.36]You're doing so badly.
[104:27.27]I haven't gotten hit since I came down here.
[104:28.93]What?
[104:29.67]What are you talking about?
[104:31.75]I haven't taken one point of damage.
[104:37.74]This is different.
[104:39.56]What's this?
[104:43.71]What does this thing do?
[104:45.35]It's like a broken needle.
[104:50.12]It's a trinket, right?
[104:50.98]Let's see.
[104:51.78]Let's cheat.
[104:53.04]There it is.
[104:54.37]Broken syringe.
[104:55.21]Gives you a random syringe effect every room.
[104:59.63]Well.
[105:02.91]Um.
[105:09.65]That could be bad.
[105:11.81]Too random.
[105:12.39]Too random.
[105:16.82]Too random.
[105:19.59]We're not going for... I don't know what that is.
[105:21.59]It's like a... like a... a foxtail.
[105:25.81]We need to work in certainties right now.
[105:27.39]I got a lot of money.
[105:58.08]I'll never know what these guys do.
[105:59.98]Okay, who's the boss?
[106:03.65]Keep him away.
[106:04.11]This is it.
[106:13.07]Oh man, that's gonna be even more, isn't it?
[106:15.07]Holy shit!
[106:21.57]Oh my god.
[106:22.35]Okay, I'm ready.
[106:24.12]This is un- this is impossible for me to lose, right?
[106:28.50]I'm going in.
[106:28.92]I don't even care.
[106:29.38]I got full hearts, I got a book, and I got strength.
[106:31.53]Three, two, one.
[106:33.19]Go.
[106:58.46]And I was gonna hold reset on this shit.
[107:03.09]Alright, well.
[107:04.51]There's my evil up.
[107:10.33]Okay, what do you got for me, devil?
[107:11.73]Not that it was Krampus.
[107:12.61]Let's go!
[107:15.33]Take the deal.
[107:16.35]What deal?
[107:16.79]This is it, right?
[107:23.64]This is the end.
[107:25.08]Orbs 2.
[107:27.59]Look at those.
[107:28.03]Look at those three huge rooms down there.
[107:30.21]What the fuck?
[107:37.19]Holy shit.
[107:39.23]That was insane.
[107:54.68]Casino.
[107:58.51]I can do the Book of Belial twice.
[107:59.43]God dammit.
[107:59.65]Scammed.
[108:32.78]That's what I want.
[108:33.34]There it is.
[108:34.50]Right in the middle.
[108:34.90]There we go.
[108:40.93]You don't even need that.
[108:43.07]But I want it.
[108:43.87]It has nothing to do with needing anything.
[108:45.14]It has to do with wanting it.
[108:46.20]What am I going to spend it on?
[108:59.80]At this point, it's just a thing I want.
[109:03.42]See?
[109:04.00]That's why we collect these things.
[109:11.96]Look at this tier delay.
[109:19.52]This is like soy milk.
[109:23.67]Come on.
[109:24.15]Yeah, we want the cosmetic.
[109:26.43]What just happened?
[109:28.19]Oh.
[109:50.27]Poop hat or riot?
[109:51.51]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[109:55.45]What do you think this is?
[109:58.26]I'm very clearly trying to get the shithat Jerma, get- use the blood bank to get yourself to one heart to have the Polaroid be active Did I do that?
[110:17.63]Did I do that?
[110:18.63]Did I do that?
[110:21.27]Like that?
[110:33.41]You have to be at half a heart.
[110:34.97]Oh, well I can't... If I do that again, I'll die.
[110:39.38]I'll pick up half a heart and then do it.
[110:41.10]Okay.
[110:50.90]Cool.
[110:57.33]What does that matter?
[111:03.74]How often is that going to activate?
[111:07.76]It does it better.
[111:09.02]So why did I just do that?
[111:12.81]When I get hit, I'll go invincible.
[111:14.79]Every time you get hit, you'll be invincible.
[111:17.90]God, I love this game.
[111:19.02]Don't you just love this game?
[111:22.39]Don't you just love having a 20 of everything?
[111:27.15]Don't you love getting the poop hat?
[111:28.77]Is that I'm not leaving till I get it?
[111:30.38]Just don't accidentally touch any of that shit.
[111:34.36]Alright, I'll do it.
[111:35.28]Here, here, here, here.
[111:35.90]There you go.
[111:37.62]See?
[111:38.54]Nothing.
[111:42.45]I picked up a fucking stupid heart.
[111:56.57]Attention.
[111:57.03]Okay, I don't care about... I'm leaving.
[111:59.75]I don't want to do it anymore.
[112:05.03]I don't care.
[112:07.56]Use the machine when you have a shield.
[112:09.00]No, that means I'm going to get more money.
[112:11.86]And I'll have to sit in here for another 20 minutes.
[112:13.68]Just scam money with the shield.
[112:19.24]I don't want any more money.
[112:20.14]I don't want any more money.
[112:29.39]Alright, no.
[112:30.47]Okay.
[112:31.41]Scam!
[112:32.99]Don't do it!
[112:33.57]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[112:36.21]I'll do it accidentally and die.
[112:37.35]Oh no, don't do that.
[112:39.37]Where's my poop hat?
[112:43.30]Where's the hat?
[112:45.48]This kills me.
[112:47.42]Okay, I can get a troll bomb.
[112:48.60]I'm leaving.
[112:48.98]Okay, I'm done.
[112:51.00]I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[112:56.92]No, bye.
[112:59.57]I'm not gonna get it!
[113:00.56]What was that?
[113:19.75]You only get one chance.
[113:23.68]Wait.
[113:24.84]You only get one chance.
[113:30.19]Or is somebody just saying that to, like, save the stream?
[113:43.69]It's a hero.
[113:47.72]Oh, I don't want any more hearts.
[113:49.12]Come on, I have ten chances here.
[113:50.38]Hold down?
[113:53.02]I'm not gonna do that because I'll walk into the fucking enemy.
[114:05.94]You need to hold R to activate your shield.
[114:15.62]Five chances is it.
[114:16.94]I'm not going to even get it.
[114:17.88]It's not even going to show up again.
[114:29.98]One more chance, that's it.
[114:33.98]Yeah, sorry.
[114:35.04]You don't get a poop hat.
[114:36.32]Sorry, guys.
[114:39.30]Don't!
[114:39.82]I don't care.
[114:40.16]I have 28 keys.
[114:41.38]Do we think I give a shit about this?
[114:42.68]Let's go.
[114:43.04]Wait.
[114:48.56]What's that?
[114:50.62]Why is that hard to have shit on it?
[114:53.96]Wait.
[114:54.32]It's blocking the door.
[114:55.12]It's blocking the door.
[114:57.25]It's blocking the door.
[114:59.59]Okay, I'm fine.
[115:00.59]Don't pick it up.
[115:01.13]It's blocking.
[115:01.69]Can I move it?
[115:02.19]I'm going to blow a bomb up next to it.
[115:14.93]I'm out.
[115:15.15]I don't care.
[115:18.43]I don't even... I don't care what it does.
[115:19.57]I don't want it.
[115:29.24]You owe us a poop hat.
[115:35.68]Shit.
[115:38.12]Is this... Is that full health?
[115:40.96]This is not gonna give me, like, health.
[115:47.68]Oh shit!
[115:49.20]No!
[115:50.24]Stop opening chests!
[115:52.46]No more opening chests and shit.
[115:54.84]There's probably hearts in there.
[115:57.89]Give me a fucking break.
[116:02.99]Don't touch anything.
[116:11.81]No, I'm not.
[116:12.45]I don't care about the poop hat.
[116:14.77]Somebody make a new username for it.
[116:16.13]I don't care.
[116:42.01]Get out of the way!
[116:42.95]Get out of the way!
[116:43.77]You're blocking my shot!
[116:47.65]How many more?
[116:52.56]I heard something.
[116:54.68]I heard a... What was that?
[117:20.03]Excuse me, excuse me!
[117:52.86]Come here.
[118:01.57]Okay.
[118:06.66]Oh, bunch of drugs.
[118:20.72]Okay, um... Should I just take this?
[118:25.35]And just forget about the shield?
[118:26.89]Because... Uh... I mean... You're talking about, like, three or four hits that I can't take?
[118:36.72]I'm gonna carry it with me.
[118:39.32]I've got an idea.
[118:40.12]We're gonna do health up again.
[118:43.72]Right?
[118:45.48]And then, I'm gonna do full health... If I lose these hearts.
[118:51.24]You know what I'm saying?
[118:51.98]If I go down to one... spirit heart, I'm gonna do... eat the... Am I an idiot?
[118:57.20]Is that a bad idea?
[118:58.20]Alright, I'm just gonna take the health up, but what about the strength?
[119:02.90]You'll lose it.
[119:03.61]Holy shit.
[119:04.35]Okay.
[119:08.39]Fuck strength.
[119:09.47]Just heal and use strength.
[119:10.75]Full health just makes you lose health.
[119:15.29]Just... take the health.
[119:17.99]Who cares?
[119:18.73]Take strength and leave.
[119:21.29]Let me take strength.
[119:22.03]I can't leave?
[119:23.71]Alright, okay, alright, alright, alright.
[119:26.61]Take the full health, not health.
[119:28.29]Fuck, okay.
[119:29.61]Alright, I'm ready.
[119:30.88]Let's go.
[119:31.48]Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[119:33.44]I'm ready.
[119:33.82]I'm ready.
[119:34.36]I'm ready.
[119:35.22]I'm ready.
[119:36.04]I'm ready.
[119:36.86]I'm ready.
[119:43.33]Use strength now.
[119:44.03]That is not going to do anything.
[119:44.93]It's going to disappear.
[119:45.41]It's going to disappear.
[119:50.52]Use it and take the strength.
[119:51.91]I'm gonna go up my gut!
[119:53.17]I'm gonna go up my gut!
[119:59.97]What?
[120:18.04]What is all this stuff?
[120:23.72]What's that radish thing?
[120:24.66]Did I get it?
[120:31.04]What does it do?
[120:36.08]Delicious.
[120:36.62]Rotten tomato.
[120:44.73]I'm going.
[120:49.81]The witness.
[121:02.89]And you were concerned and you were concerned oh, that's not it Look at the little spiders like what happened dad?
[121:26.77]That was so easy.
[121:28.33]I killed it.
[121:29.23]That was so fucking bad.
[121:31.47]I'm like sitting there debating, what should I do?
[121:33.35]I've got fucking 21 damage and two tier delay.
[121:38.81]Pull up skull.
[121:52.24]Well, that was fun.
[121:56.54]Why is there a helicopter overhead?
[121:59.07]More?
[122:02.56]Use every bomb.
[122:26.78]That was cool.
[122:28.62]That build was really, really, really powerful.
[122:49.24]You unlocked Jacob and Aesop.
[122:51.30]You unlocked Challenge 8, Awakening.
[122:53.24]You unlocked Challenge 9, Seeing Double.
[122:57.09]What did I unlock?
[122:59.34]What the fuck?
[123:00.92]Jacob and Aeson.
[123:05.48]You play two people?
[123:10.81]That seems kind of cool.
[123:15.07]Let me see what this looks like.
[123:21.00]What?
[123:23.19]Wait.
[123:24.03]They have their own health bars.
[123:26.81]This is some ice climber shit.
[123:28.09]I don't know if I can handle this.
[123:33.26]Do they get different items each?
[123:35.48]Or do they use the same item?
[123:50.27]This is cool.
[123:53.31]Alright, can Papa get knocked off the stage?
[123:57.27]This reminds me of Lilith, but way cooler.
[124:17.53]So if one of them dies, do they both die?
[124:19.93]This is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[124:26.60]Yes!
[124:27.26]Oh, God.
[124:27.82]Uh-oh, wait.
[124:36.48]Uh-oh.
[124:38.83]Wait, you can't- How do I make them go back together again?
[124:40.73]Just push them to the wall.
[124:42.03]Okay, there we go.
[124:45.63]They can get stuck.
[124:48.11]You got de-synced.
[124:50.22]Ooh, yup.
[124:51.26]This is... I know I see where the trickiness of this comes in.
[124:56.86]The trickiness of playing as, uh... Ben and Jerry?
[125:00.58]What are their names?
[125:01.50]Jacob and... And... It's... What is it?
[125:11.27]Iso?
[125:21.16]I'll get that key.
[125:21.76]Don't worry.
[125:22.08]I'm just clearing.
[125:24.04]But they both have the effects of whatever item you pick up.
[125:31.33]Read the Bible.
[125:33.63]Oh, sorry.
[125:34.35]Okay.
[125:35.07]Yeah.
[125:36.17]Yeah, sorry.
[125:36.49]I'm not caught up with my fucking Bible lore.
[125:40.31]I'm sorry.
[125:41.57]Yeah.
[125:42.09]Let me read the Bible real quick to figure out who these two are.
[125:47.76]This isn't like Infinity War, you know what I mean?
[125:50.48]Like, I haven't read the Bible in a very long time.
[125:56.15]What?
[125:57.03]Who ha- What's going on?
[125:58.61]Who has that?
[125:59.73]Where is it?
[126:00.57]What just happened?
[126:07.75]It was used?
[126:08.80]It's used instantly?
[126:10.70]They use pickups automatically?
[126:13.22]What the fuck?
[126:15.54]Why?
[126:15.92]Hold on.
[126:17.18]So I can't use any pickups.
[126:18.60]I don't have anything to blow it up with.
[126:26.70]I want an item room.
[126:41.77]They auto-use pickups because they can each have a different active item?
[126:45.50]That's bizarre.
[126:49.99]That's weird.
[127:08.65]I can see this being really fun, though, if you get some... If you get, like, the Ouroboros tears, whatever, the ones that spin around, and, like, anti-gravity and shit, this could be really, really cool.
[127:29.80]Awww.
[127:30.68]That's unfortunate.
[127:32.88]That's unfortunate.
[127:34.85]I mean, just use it.
[127:36.17]No, they use it automatically!
[127:37.37]I can't... Oh, this is not... It doesn't just fall on the ground.
[127:44.15]Oh.
[127:53.11]That's a reset right there, if I've ever seen one.
[127:59.48]Reset Randy.
[128:02.36]Come on, you would reset too.
[128:05.12]You would reset too if you were in my position.
[128:07.30]Wait, is it the MonkaS?
[128:20.99]Is that what we should be doing?
[128:23.30]The Book of Genesis speaks of the relationship between, I don't know, the
[128:38.07]Guys, the only book of Genesis I've ever read was when GameStop used to come out with the cheat code book for the different consoles.
[128:59.78]No, don't pick it up!
[129:01.64]Oh!
[129:01.98]Oh!
[129:03.04]Here comes a reaction!
[129:03.88]Uh-oh!
[129:24.47]One, two.
[129:25.29]One, two.
[129:26.11]One, two.
[129:26.57]One, two.
[129:32.17]Game's pretty fucking good.
[129:37.22]Ooh.
[129:37.52]Ooh.
[129:39.98]Looks like we ain't going to the underworld, or whatever it's called.
[129:43.92]Don't stand over there.
[129:45.37]Yeah, I know.
[129:46.23]I saw it.
[129:50.35]Genesis I know you don't have to spy.
[129:52.74]We don't need but this is not like the Bible study class Who's taking it?
[130:00.66]Yeah Speaking of item rooms Where the hell is the item room?
[130:23.92]Uh-oh, gonna have to start dishing out some timeouts here.
[130:28.70]Gonna have to start timing people out for their misbehavior.
[130:33.94]Uh-oh, gonna have to start timing people out for their unbehaving.
[130:58.28]Wait, they both don't get it.
[131:02.25]Only one of them gets it?
[131:04.33]This is so confusing.
[131:08.31]Oh, so you have to plan out who's going to be what character.
[131:13.15]You have to play... They get separate stats each.
[131:18.97]This is so cool.
[131:20.05]Let's see if I can get that.
[131:24.91]Just Jack up one character.
[131:26.41]Yeah, alright.
[131:26.85]What if I just make one character insane?
[131:29.26]And just make sure the other one doesn't die.
[131:36.18]Where's that tinted rock?
[131:40.61]Give every health item to one person and give every damage item to another person.
[131:44.77]And then the one with the health just stands in the front.
[131:47.69]Okay, this is... What the?
[131:52.34]I...
[131:56.41]Get us out of here!
[132:02.22]Fuck.
[132:03.60]One of them's almost dead.
[132:04.84]Who's the one on the bottom right?
[132:07.48]Red guy or green guy?
[132:08.90]Okay, red guy can't get hit anymore.
[132:18.85]Oh, shit.
[132:31.87]Smush.
[132:35.25]It's Mario and Luigi?
[132:47.27]Oh god.
[132:50.43]It's too confusing with... Shit.
[133:00.85]Watch out for that fire!
[133:02.13]Oh, come on!
[133:16.54]Stop!
[133:17.18]I-I can't move!
[133:18.30]If I move up or if I move down, one of them's gonna get hit!
[133:27.89]I-
[133:32.03]God.
[133:32.47]That's okay.
[133:36.35]Shit.
[133:43.65]It's okay.
[133:47.47]Watch out for super frog.
[133:58.60]Nothing.
[134:04.43]Just give me an item room.
[134:07.43]Damage or something.
[134:14.27]What?
[134:14.49]Fucking die.
[134:23.26]I wanna bring these two into greed mode.
[134:24.52]How come it doesn't exist?
[134:31.06]Jesus Christ!
[134:38.81]Does that mean I get more than one key?
[134:41.74]So if this one key, does that mean it's actually two keys?
[134:43.92]Can I walk in with one of them and not the other one?
[134:56.90]Oh, I can't get that.
[135:00.26]Wait, I can't like stand on his shoulders?
[135:25.89]Okay.
[135:28.47]That's unfortunate.
[135:30.45]What's the seed?
[135:32.51]Here's the seed if you want it.
[135:33.43]I don't need to restart, yeah?
[135:41.35]I'll be happy if I can kill mom's foot with this.
[135:44.89]I'll be happy.
[135:47.63]This in and of itself is almost like a challenge mode.
[136:04.82]Mmm.
[136:06.48]Hey, that was erratic.
[136:15.39]Don't tell him you need to plug in another controller.
[136:17.33]Oh, this is also really bad, too.
[136:20.77]What?
[136:34.70]What?
[136:43.43]I can hold... Oh no, that's... I was trying to tell you that.
[136:57.38]Well... Um...
[137:02.35]So I can just play the game with this one.
[137:04.67]Just make sure this one doesn't get hit.
[137:07.73]Why would I do that?
[137:08.67]Alright, you stay over here.
[137:30.84]I just like swallowed air for a second.
[137:32.98]Relax.
[137:36.97]Might as well reroll the enemies!
[137:57.72]Whoa, that was very, very close.
[137:59.82]Okay, come on, something good.
[138:06.97]Something worth taking.
[138:08.43]Let's not re-roll enemies.
[138:10.85]Let's not, like, the wing thing, whatever it is.
[138:15.89]Oh, bad.
[138:16.39]Oh, this is bad.
[138:17.75]Oh, this is bad.
[138:29.12]Hold on, I have a wicked itchy head.
[138:30.56]Okay.
[138:47.89]There we go.
[138:54.01]Dude, these two guys, these two suck.
[138:57.80]It's not me, it's them, not me.
[139:00.08]Oh my god.
[139:10.73]Well, refill your health.
[139:12.21]Alright, if it's not a really good item, I'm gonna undo character.
[139:43.85]That doesn't break?
[139:44.37]Dead, dead, dead, dead.
[140:02.82]Okay, who's gonna take it?
[140:04.24]Red guy.
[140:05.44]You take it.
[140:05.90]Ah, yeah.
[140:14.51]Alright, red guy's gonna be the drug taker, I think.
[140:21.22]What?
[140:21.64]Red guy is food tester.
[140:24.42]Here, red guy, eat this!
[140:27.10]See if it's poisonous!
[140:29.39]Yeah, it is!
[140:29.93]Okay, I'll make sure not to eat that one.
[140:41.37]What a shitty place for this.
[140:43.30]Oh!
[140:58.40]Don't get hit by that.
[140:59.26]It's gonna shoot me again.
[141:00.32]Fucking what?
[141:01.08]Look at this!
[141:10.91]Okay, red guy, that's mine.
[141:14.31]Damage up.
[141:21.92]Not bad so far.
[141:25.03]Alright, can I make Red Guy walk into the spikes?
[141:27.69]So we can... I guess I needed that health.
[141:34.70]Damn.
[141:35.82]Red Guy, do you need health?
[141:37.80]No, do I?
[141:38.28]No.
[141:41.72]A rock.
[141:51.49]Is there a rock?
[141:57.37]Oh, up?
[141:58.55]I don't see it.
[142:03.51]Left and up.
[142:13.15]Nope!
[142:24.06]Whoa.
[142:33.77]Flies.
[142:41.44]Whoa, he just jumped very far.
[142:42.88]Okay.
[142:44.02]What is it?
[142:44.38]Who's gonna get it?
[142:44.86]Okay, it's lipstick.
[142:46.60]Get out of the fucking way, red guy.
[142:49.84]It's mine.
[142:52.56]You can have the next one, red guy.
[142:53.78]Did I go through?
[143:03.94]I don't think I want to do that.
[143:05.42]No.
[143:06.62]I want to do regular game.
[143:22.83]Destroyed on red wine.
[143:27.85]Ugh.
[143:40.51]That's pretty good.
[143:43.99]Remember, if there's a tinted rock, make sure you go.
[143:45.59]Jerma, I see a tinted rock!
[143:48.48]I see one.
[143:48.90]Nothing so loud.
[144:01.63]It annoys me.
[144:11.61]Alright, red guy.
[144:13.87]Okay!
[144:15.26]Good.
[144:16.32]Very good.
[144:36.85]Oh, he leaks!
[144:38.29]I didn't know he leaked.
[144:56.62]He leaks!
[145:03.42]Oh my god, I'm- alright, I'm gonna- Oh my... GOD!
[145:16.41]It's the- Fucking die!
[145:43.08]Alright, you each get one.
[145:44.26]Share.
[145:51.10]I see intended rock.
[145:53.18]Where?
[145:59.10]Those dumb enemies.
[146:00.36]Dumb.
[146:10.59]Who should take it?
[146:20.42]What does this do?
[146:21.16]It spawns flies?
[146:27.16]That's pretty cool.
[146:28.14]Ooh, that is pretty cool.
[146:38.49]Does it really matter?
[146:39.23]You just take it automatically.
[146:42.37]Hold on.
[146:50.75]From what?
[146:51.39]What happened?
[146:55.29]What?
[146:57.91]Wait.
[147:03.65]I'm gonna go from both sides.
[147:04.72]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[147:06.58]We're gonna move.
[147:07.82]Oh, I'm so stupid.
[147:08.86]I didn't think that through.
[147:10.40]I had to move.
[147:11.54]Okay, hold on.
[147:12.24]You need the red guy.
[147:13.08]Go get it.
[147:22.03]I don't think that's Rue at all.
[147:26.78]Okay, what is it?
[147:29.76]Ooh, yay.
[147:49.12]He loves it.
[147:51.18]He loves it.
[147:52.06]Let's go.
[148:04.84]Frozen in fear.
[148:25.48]Oh, come on.
[148:26.14]Why do you have to explode?
[148:28.08]What's the point in that?
[148:29.90]What's the point in that?
[148:32.16]You're just trolling your audience.
[148:35.60]You're trolling your gaming audience.
[148:37.23]Oh, God.
[148:37.77]I died.
[148:38.23]I actually died.
[149:04.18]Wait, I have an idea.
[149:04.82]Okay, good.
[149:34.81]Now, those items were trashy anyways.
[149:38.21]You know, like what?
[149:38.89]I got mom's tampon thing.
[149:44.51]Not even worth it.
[149:45.01]I didn't get any good items.
[149:47.63]Red guy got hit like four times.
[149:52.69]Wait.
[149:55.78]Did they both get a familiar?
[150:01.56]If you pick up a familiar.
[150:03.72]Oh, what?
[150:04.26]What's this game?
[150:04.86]Not even worth it.
[150:07.98]Alright, uh, who gets the drugs?
[150:11.55]I, red guy, you do it.
[150:23.53]Speed is good with these two.
[150:28.80]They both get it.
[150:29.58]Nice.
[150:29.84]So they shared the drugs?
[150:33.49]I know.
[150:33.81]I see it too.
[150:36.73]What was that?
[150:37.63]Oh, it was the stupid exploding bug.
[150:40.73]Alright.
[150:52.16]You know who's taking it.
[150:55.03]Why did it hurt me?
[150:57.81]Wait, he said, did he took the drugs and then slap me in the face?
[151:05.82]Well, this is gonna be a pain in the ass, huh?
[151:30.26]Restart?
[151:30.82]Oh my god.
[151:35.70]No, not until I... Not until I fight the boss.
[151:46.93]Oh, we're dead.
[151:56.90]We're like so thick together.
[152:17.71]Oh!
[152:17.83]Okay, we're good.
[152:19.83]What is it?
[152:21.05]Dog food.
[152:21.85]Red guy.
[152:22.21]I don't have any keys, so we have to go down.
[152:36.32]No keys.
[152:38.39]Ejerma hates restarting.
[152:40.69]Well, not... Okay, if I don't get any keys, I want to play as a different character.
[152:44.93]But the random... You have to go with the random.
[152:46.70]You gotta roll with... And that's the nature of the game.
[152:52.28]I want to make these two work.
[152:54.16]But... I might not be able to.
[153:08.65]Red guy's pissed.
[153:13.68]Excuse me.
[153:15.40]Alright, more drugs.
[153:18.42]Shot speed down.
[153:21.06]Can I run faster than the shots?
[153:22.57]Are you serious?
[153:32.79]That's so stupid.
[153:43.27]Bomb.
[153:43.85]Bomb.
[153:44.41]Bomb.
[153:45.39]It's a bomb.
[153:46.94]It's not a bomb.
[153:51.68]Split up.
[154:02.13]No.
[154:02.27]I don't want it.
[154:16.93]Alright, it's not bad.
[154:18.29]It's not bad.
[154:18.97]We just need a key.
[154:23.52]I got quite a leap on you.
[154:30.20]Grandma, I see a rock.
[154:31.56]I see a tinted rock.
[154:35.00]You do?
[154:37.47]No, you don't.
[154:44.25]You don't see a... What are you talking about?
[155:11.41]Alright.
[155:12.89]No keys either.
[155:17.45]Right there.
[155:17.99]Oh my god!
[155:22.62]Horrible room.
[155:29.70]Who gets the Jawbreaker?
[155:31.72]Why is there not a third Ed Brother?
[155:33.22]I get it.
[155:48.22]I need health.
[155:48.72]Is there any hearts lying down on the ground somewhere?
[155:50.16]There's not.
[155:59.67]This is bad.
[156:00.35]This might be a reset.
[156:02.15]This might be a restart.
[156:05.47]Depends on what happens here.
[156:17.44]Holy shit, I almost... Did I eat it?
[156:18.98]I'm good.
[156:26.97]Dog food again.
[156:29.19]Well... We may as well just have them both be the same.
[156:34.23]But there's a devil deal.
[156:36.09]Okay.
[156:36.35]Holy shit.
[156:37.28]Alright, one of you take the... Alright.
[156:40.94]One of you take the collar, and one of you take the tail.
[156:42.96]Hold on, will he die?
[156:53.02]die alright so what if you take the collar and the tail and then I make sure you stay alive okay red guy
[157:25.63]What have you ruined?
[157:27.39]Why?
[157:29.61]Times one?
[157:31.69]Was that joke funny?
[157:33.07]I don't know.
[157:34.53]Still can't get in the item room.
[157:39.24]That sucks.
[158:05.57]Oh, dude, drinking game.
[158:06.43]Drink every time Jerry says, this is bad.
[158:07.77]This is it.
[158:09.21]This is bad.
[158:10.57]Oh, no, this is bad.
[158:12.11]Oh, it's bad.
[158:15.67]Jerry, drink fucking water, though.
[158:16.91]Not anything else.
[158:19.37]It's a water drinking game.
[158:20.41]You take a shot of water.
[158:27.71]What?
[158:27.97]What is this?
[158:28.55]Church?
[158:29.79]You know what I mean?
[158:30.27]Like, oh, we're taking shots of water.
[158:34.99]You don't have to drink that alcohol.
[158:38.18]No, we don't.
[158:38.78]No, no, no, no, no.
[158:57.40]Big plays.
[158:58.90]Come on.
[158:59.31]Big plays, big plays.
[159:15.37]There we go.
[159:17.33]Run over.
[159:19.57]Oh, you sure about that?
[159:20.70]Run over, huh?
[159:21.92]Run over?
[159:23.00]Run over?
[159:25.02]Red guy.
[159:26.44]Get it.
[159:41.07]I feel like I'm playing every Resident Evil game that had co-op after 2008.
[159:44.89]Oh my fucking god.
[159:48.61]That hurt my whole body.
[159:53.56]That actually did hurt.
[159:54.22]That sucked.
[159:54.96]Fuck.
[159:58.18]They both... They both hit the fire.
[160:12.05]So it doesn't matter who picks this shit up.
[160:14.99]I guess you got that one.
[160:21.43]Jerma Isaac 1.
[160:22.67]Okay.
[160:31.15]I'll allow it.
[160:32.65]I'll allow it.
[160:58.26]Pretty good.
[160:59.10]Pretty good.
[161:00.74]Nice work.
[161:06.06]Okay.
[161:07.20]So after we completely fuck that whole thing up... Opening.
[161:18.57]I see an opening.
[161:19.17]I see an opening.
[161:42.38]This guy's fucking insane at this game.
[161:44.04]Imagine like you just came in right now and you're like... Imagine like you're like... And you're like... And you're like... How many times can you say fucking like in the same fucking like sentence?
[161:53.33]Like fucking like.
[161:53.87]Imagine like you... Imagine you come in right now.
[162:34.60]Speed up.
[162:35.38]I don't want speed up.
[162:36.28]It kind of sucks with these two.
[162:39.55]Because they run into walls.
[162:41.71]Jeremiah, I see it.
[162:42.39]It's a rock.
[162:47.39]It doesn't matter who gets it.
[162:48.11]It doesn't matter.
[162:49.73]I need keys.
[162:53.06]Have I found one key in the whole time?
[162:55.02]In like three floors?
[162:59.46]Oh, you...
[163:07.16]Whoa.
[163:07.44]That was close.
[163:23.06]Blow up.
[163:23.90]Blow up.
[163:25.26]Blow up.
[163:29.52]Okay.
[163:31.16]Okay, now I need... Should I open a...
[163:35.55]Hey, scared money don't make money.
[163:47.88]Back to Bob's brain.
[163:49.56]Bob's brain percent.
[163:52.20]It's over.
[163:54.94]Okay, like, if you could make a bet right now.
[164:00.57]And you had...
[164:01.99]Like, let's say it was 500 to 1 odds that I wasn't going to die in the next one floor.
[164:10.14]Would you take those odds now that I have Bob's brain and one heart?
[164:14.74]Like, would you take that?
[164:15.56]Would you do that?
[164:16.12]Would you be like, you know what?
[164:17.00]I think he, you know what?
[164:17.90]It's a huge fucking chance, but I think he might be able to do this.
[164:26.71]Would you put like 10 bucks on that?
[164:35.52]What happened?
[164:36.24]Oh.
[164:41.58]Wait, where's Bob's brain?
[164:43.00]Where's the... Oh, there it is.
[164:45.52]Okay.
[164:45.84]I got a little concerned there for a second.
[164:51.12]Hold on a second.
[164:54.22]Just have Red Guy die every time.
[164:57.98]And I'll never lose.
[165:03.79]Just have him get killed every time.
[165:20.13]That's gonna kill me.
[165:21.90]Might as well just play as a different character at this point.
[165:26.72]There's no way I'm gonna live.
[165:32.36]These two are cool, but they really are very difficult to play.
[165:45.95]Oh yeah, I was gonna do a Bethany run, wasn't I?
[165:47.67]I'm gonna try.
[165:54.39]Oh my God, everything.
[166:21.22]Watch out for that fucking brain.
[166:23.68]It's okay.
[166:24.72]I'm never gonna.
[166:25.98]Just go in a different room.
[166:27.46]Just go in a different room.
[166:28.50]Oh, great.
[166:29.06]Super wrath.
[167:02.02]With these two it's too hard.
[167:04.00]I'm too concerned about Bob's brain now.
[167:06.04]And I gotta move them both around.
[167:08.85]They're both super thick.
[167:09.97]It's triple the hitbox.
[167:33.42]Did I even go to the item room yet?
[167:34.58]No.
[167:34.96]I don't have a fucking key.
[167:41.71]Jump, Bob!
[167:47.66]What's still alive?
[167:53.16]Don't.
[168:08.80]Okay.
[168:12.02]We can continue.
[168:21.90]Sorry, I can never lose.
[168:33.42]I can play as many times as I want.
[168:45.81]Don't leave me!
[168:46.47]Don't leave me!
[168:47.39]Don't leave me!
[168:51.70]Oh my god, I almost just killed him with Bob's brain.
[168:55.14]Back up!
[168:56.00]Back up.
[168:56.38]Together.
[169:08.11]Alright, we're good.
[169:14.85]No key.
[169:23.29]This is like the kid that's rented out the arcade and gets as many coins as he wants.
[169:28.41]Oh, there's Chad.
[169:33.82]I can see that.
[169:34.44]The thing I got is Bob's big ass brain.
[169:55.10]Dude, I could... No, just do the... Do the regular game.
[170:01.60]I have no chance.
[170:06.21]Do it!
[170:07.75]Do it!
[170:10.83]Item room?
[170:11.37]I can't get into the item room.
[170:14.54]You're immortal.
[170:15.90]Literally immortal.
[170:17.96]Yeah, I'm immortal, but I can die over and over again.
[170:22.30]I still have to not get hit.
[170:24.45]Secret room.
[170:26.01]Where's the secret room?
[170:26.71]Up here?
[170:38.47]This is training.
[170:40.94]Right here, right?
[170:42.20]Well, let's just cover all of our bases.
[170:43.88]It's like one of these slots right here.
[170:48.14]No?
[170:52.56]What the fuck?
[170:53.88]No.
[170:56.10]What the fuck?
[170:57.74]Line up with the door.
[170:58.76]Alright.
[171:00.34]What are you guys talking about?
[171:04.26]No.
[171:19.53]You can't use brain.
[171:26.42]Yeah, I just get to time travel.
[171:29.04]I can just go back in time.
[171:31.70]I get hit once and I die, but I can do it infinite amount of times.
[171:35.80]Alright, who thinks has better luck at the casino?
[171:42.81]Red guy or other guy?
[172:03.23]Oh my god.
[172:04.51]I just panicked through Bob's brain.
[172:08.69]We need hearts.
[172:10.94]No!
[172:15.20]I can't.
[172:15.92]Just blow it all up.
[172:36.72]Fire the brain, fire the brain, fire the brain.
[172:41.97]Retreat, retreat, retreat.
[173:05.93]What is this one?
[173:06.37]I just unlocked it.
[173:09.23]Isaac's... What the fuck?
[173:20.26]You get a sword?
[173:21.22]Wait a minute.
[173:29.80]Is it an actual melee weapon?
[173:33.83]Dude you can... I'm gonna be real good at this.
[173:36.40]I think I found the thing that I can do very well.
[173:49.11]I'm gonna kill every boss in less than a second.
[174:08.51]How much damage does it do?
[174:09.57]Does it get damage up?
[174:11.34]How can I find this out in the wild?
[174:12.90]Goddammit.
[174:34.80]Let's go.
[174:36.91]Cuckoo flies?
[174:37.55]Oh, that's really interesting.
[174:38.71]Really cool, like, character you are.
[174:41.89]Let me introduce you to fucking 39.2 mouse clicks a second.
[175:00.93]What's this?
[175:06.32]Still hit?
[175:06.76]That's fine.
[175:07.26]If I take one heart, I'll spam and kill him instantly.
[175:09.78]Yeah, I don't want to do that.
[175:14.08]I want item room.
[175:20.05]I can pick the rocks up.
[175:21.49]Yeah, that's... Yep.
[175:26.87]There is no item room in these challenges, is there?
[175:30.30]No, there's no item room in challenges.
[175:44.91]Coins.
[175:46.33]Fuck.
[175:48.28]You have the bracelet of strength.
[175:50.16]Re.
[175:52.20]Pick up coins.
[175:52.78]What the fuck?
[175:55.27]I'm gonna get them.
[175:56.49]Wait, where?
[175:57.23]Why did that just not show up on my fucking mini-map?
[176:13.31]You have the bracelet of- yeah, funny.
[176:20.43]Okay, let's go.
[176:37.67]Slow down, MonkaS, please.
[176:45.13]nope so does the shield block all projectiles or is only some this is a really cool item though is this added in anti-birth or is this an item that's in the base game
[177:17.24]It's from Antibur, though.
[177:18.74]Okay.
[177:25.49]Got a big arc, too.
[177:31.41]Let's just go... Hold on.
[177:33.59]Whatever.
[177:43.94]Let's go kill this boss instantly.
[177:59.96]HP up.
[178:02.34]Not like it matters, but I could maybe try to find a key.
[178:13.02]Beep.
[178:21.54]There we go.
[178:22.27]Finally.
[178:28.26]No rocks?
[178:28.84]What about this?
[178:29.38]Can I pick a throw bucket?
[178:31.34]Ooh, it has money in it!
[178:32.70]That's cool.
[178:34.91]Do all of them have money in them?
[178:36.99]Um, I just got a fucking item.
[178:42.83]Bloodsucker?
[178:50.42]That's Little Leechie.
[178:52.64]Alright, item room or just pray?
[178:59.28]Thank you.
[179:01.72]And I have enough for an item in the item room.
[179:05.34]Look at that.
[179:06.88]Perfect.
[179:09.80]Too bad.
[179:11.91]Too bad.
[179:19.25]Wait, what?
[179:20.91]Hold on, I can... I can hold it out?
[179:24.34]It's a lance?
[179:27.47]Deck of Cards is good.
[179:28.49]Yeah, but I have Rock Throw.
[179:38.71]Won't replace it.
[179:39.29]What do you mean it won't replace it?
[179:41.22]This is a... Oh, it's a passive.
[179:45.20]I thought that was the... And there's the Sun card.
[179:49.84]Okay.
[179:52.56]Well.
[179:53.98]I thought that was the one that was the active that you had to activate.
[179:55.92]Okay.
[180:03.13]Let's keep going.
[180:06.53]Kermit doesn't get the reference.
[180:09.59]He hates Zelda.
[180:11.65]I don't play Zelda.
[180:16.98]I don't play Zelda.
[180:17.56]I play FPS games.
[180:21.78]I need money for this.
[180:24.82]How do I cycle between the cards?
[180:26.30]Right, there we go, yeah.
[180:27.98]I need money before I summon him.
[180:42.95]Throw them all.
[180:44.19]The buckets seem to give you good shit.
[180:47.25]This game is literally Zelda.
[180:48.47]It's not.
[180:48.79]It is literally StarTropics.
[180:50.47]Sorry.
[180:53.50]It's not Zelda.
[180:54.42]It's StarTropics.
[181:05.40]It was inspired by Zelda.
[181:06.46]It was inspired by StarTropics.
[181:14.09]Hard counter countered.
[181:25.66]This is really fun.
[181:30.16]Get Ed on the line.
[181:31.35]He was inspired by StarTropics.
[181:45.61]How we doing?
[181:46.75]Good.
[181:49.13]It was inspired by the Bible.
[181:52.99]Wait, do I need to collect these?
[181:54.19]Why do I need these knife pieces?
[181:57.45]Why do I need these knife pieces shit?
[182:00.44]Why do I need these knife pieces shit?
[182:03.32]I can't even use it.
[182:13.22]Do I have to get the knife?
[182:14.24]Finish this?
[182:19.42]This is a challenge.
[182:20.22]I can't believe that fucking hit me.
[182:32.99]Wasn't everything inspired by the Bible?
[182:34.97]Fuck it.
[182:37.27]Thanks.
[182:39.63]Everything was inspired by the Bible.
[182:44.33]There's no bucket down here.
[182:45.39]A lie!
[182:48.75]The Bible was inspired by the Bible.
[182:51.77]They made another one.
[182:53.21]They wrote like three of them.
[183:02.68]Yeah, there's like the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[183:07.94]The Third Testament.
[183:12.60]I'm not opening that door.
[183:13.52]Let's go.
[183:30.79]Oh, fuck, he's doing another move.
[183:33.96]Oh, fuck you, man.
[183:46.95]Nice!
[183:50.15]HP up, tears up, shot speed down.
[183:56.78]Okay, so, let's go.
[184:03.67]You're a walking cheese grater.
[184:08.43]Wood chipper.
[184:10.33]Laugh and Jerma laughs with you.
[184:23.68]It worked!
[184:26.14]Have you ever considered that The Binding of Isaac was inspired by Zelda?
[184:28.72]It was inspired by Star Troppings.
[184:40.27]Fool.
[184:41.99]Fool sucks.
[184:58.54]Alright, look for a... Yup.
[185:01.14]Come on, Chet.
[185:04.98]Spider rock.
[185:06.40]Alright.
[185:11.23]The Bible.
[185:21.29]Play it safe here.
[185:23.39]Just fire at them.
[185:26.09]You know what?
[185:26.95]I can't even get over there.
[185:32.82]There we go.
[185:33.68]Stupid.
[185:34.14]Poked your head up.
[185:37.77]coin on the table.
[185:39.13]There's a coin on the table.
[185:40.01]It's your coin on table.
[185:41.07]Someone else will pick it up.
[185:42.99]I leave stuff behind sometimes so other people can, like, have some fun and collect coins.
[185:54.78]I keep thinking this little leech guy is a bad guy.
[185:57.50]I should give him, like, a big blue outline so I know.
[186:08.74]This game looks and plays nothing like StarTropics.
[186:13.36]Um, that's spoken like somebody that's never played one second of StarTropics.
[186:25.89]I beat StarTropics when I was 11.
[186:27.53]I think I should know.
[186:46.36]Look at how much better I am with this melee involved.
[186:49.65]Streaming.
[186:50.33]StarTropics is grid-based.
[186:52.03]This is not... Okay, guys.
[186:56.59]I think it's time to put this to rest for you once and for all.
[187:07.02]I think it's time to put this shit to rest once and for all.
[187:43.75]Sorry, what are we watching right now?
[188:21.85]What's this?
[188:22.83]Little fucking... little maggots on the ground?
[188:28.50]This is Zelda.
[188:30.62]Zelda came before this?
[188:31.70]Oh yeah?
[188:34.02]No, it's inspired by StarTropics.
[188:36.02]And by the way, the song is fucking... the song is an absolute banger.
[188:51.47]Alright, uh... Mike... Mike Jones?
[188:56.39]I think that's the main character's name?
[188:58.19]Is Mike Jones, right?
[189:00.09]He's gonna be in the Smash Bros.
[189:01.61]DLC pack number two.
[189:02.69]He'll be the fifth person.
[189:13.34]Now put on Zelda.
[189:14.80]When it starts... Zelda NES.
[189:18.30]I've never played Zelda.
[189:21.54]Alright, let's put on Zelda NES.
[189:24.09]Okay.
[189:27.77]This looks like a fucking wildly different game to me.
[189:29.75]What's going on here?
[189:50.57]What's going on here?
[189:51.69]I don't want to play your fucking MMO.
[189:53.11]Get a move.
[189:58.43]Let's go.
[189:59.01]Oh my God.
[189:59.98]I don't want to play Roblox.
[190:03.86]Oh, look at this.
[190:06.56]Just like Isaac, huh?
[190:22.23]Inspired by fucking StarTropics.
[190:27.08]By the way, StarTropics came out December 1st, 1990.
[190:29.58]That's when the fucking Zelda came out.
[190:33.08]1993?
[190:33.26]Yeah.
[190:34.92]I knew it.
[190:36.34]Zelda.
[190:37.06]Legend of Zelda.
[190:38.32]NES came out.
[190:40.48]On... Uh... February 21st, 1996.
[190:46.73]So, sorry guys.
[190:48.95]That's not... Who copied who?
[191:12.30]Star Trap is fucking sick.
[191:13.96]If you guys only played it, you would know that it's inspired by... It inspired The Binding of Isaac.
[191:27.70]Wait, there were games before Fortnite?
[191:32.32]Ow!
[191:32.92]I got blocked projectiles, why am I not using this?
[191:37.55]How am I not... I have so many keys, just go in.
[191:47.31]Isaac was inspired by GTA 3.
[191:59.11]I thought you could drive a car in this game.
[192:09.29]Oh, too bad!
[192:10.55]Fucking relax, what the hell am I doing?
[192:16.77]Oh yeah!
[192:17.69]Alright, I'm done.
[192:26.32]I can't block those?
[192:30.21]Oh, that's not good.
[192:32.25]See?
[192:32.59]Told you.
[192:32.85]Pick up the TNT.
[192:33.68]I can't.
[192:37.04]I can't pick up TNT.
[192:39.66]Fuck.
[192:40.62]I'm... I'm done.
[192:41.59]I'm done for.
[192:42.03]I can't just use the only thing I'm good at, which is pressing a button very fast.
[193:01.79]Block it with shield.
[193:12.73]Oh, this sucks.
[193:16.82]Oh, fuck.
[193:17.36]This is bad.
[193:19.56]I can't even get over there.
[193:22.92]Like, that thing's gotta...
[193:34.42]Oh, I didn't block it.
[193:35.24]Fuck.
[193:35.44]Alright, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[193:53.25]I made McMillan's death.
[193:54.15]What do you want?
[193:54.91]What?
[193:56.53]What?
[194:10.29]Copy Zelda and Meat Boy to copy Mario.
[194:12.17]Just make it your own and be true.
[194:13.92]I know, fucking Zelda is one of the inspirations.
[194:22.38]One of the many inspirations of Binding of Isaac.
[194:35.04]Bomb this guy?
[194:37.52]Does it work?
[194:39.40]Doesn't work.
[194:42.56]It's one of the many inspirations of Binding of Isaac.
[194:45.44]StarTropics is one of them.
[194:51.93]He never mentions StarTropics once ever in any interviews.
[195:01.75]Oh, come on.
[195:02.41]Are you sure?
[195:27.85]Okay, if you type... If you type in... This is where it gets sad.
[195:32.23]When you type in, Binding of Isaac StarTropics, there are only four pages of results.
[195:39.91]And when you get to page three, or page two, you get... You're going back to like 2008 of... That's almost impossible that there's three pages on Google.
[196:03.48]Look, I never said that it was the direct inspiration for Isaac.
[196:07.44]I said it was one of the many factors in a long line of clearing enemies in a room and then the door opens and using keys to go in those rooms.
[196:15.87]In a long line of those games is what I said.
[196:21.57]Binding of Isaac is directly inspired by Zelda, StarTropics, and viewers like you.
[196:36.39]Coming up next is Arthur, episode 380.
[196:39.10]He gaslit himself, is what happened.
[197:02.09]Hot, is it hot, is it hot?
[197:07.27]Backpedal!
[197:08.11]What?
[197:08.55]I... Tell me.
[197:10.25]You play Star Tropic.
[197:13.01]You'll see.
[197:15.97]There's items.
[197:17.09]There's item shop in Star Tropic.
[197:20.00]There's little maggot enemies that go... When they fly over.
[197:24.72]Look, I know.
[197:26.60]I've played it.
[197:32.33]Fuck.
[197:32.71]Technique.
[197:33.41]Yes, well...
[197:56.19]Yep!
[197:58.97]Get you some hearts.
[198:06.70]You know... Not yet.
[198:18.50]Zelda had hearts.
[198:21.28]Yeah, StarTropics had hearts too.
[198:26.67]Remember, if you say the word StarTropics again, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[198:33.30]Said, like, okay, this is ridiculous.
[198:35.60]Unbelievable.
[198:38.90]That's un-fucking-believable.
[198:45.17]Alright, bite him.
[198:47.75]Eat this guy.
[198:56.96]Eat them.
[198:58.44]Eat them.
[199:01.63]Eat them.
[199:04.77]Eat them.
[199:08.75]You're not eating them fast enough.
[199:19.90]Eat everybody.
[199:26.92]StarTropics had religious imagery, and... Well, StarTropics was aliens.
[199:34.23]So, I mean... Are there fucking aliens in Zelda?
[199:38.91]Are there aliens in the fuck?
[199:49.61]Aliens in the Bible.
[199:52.44]And then that is when, that is when Peter spoke upon the large alien creature.
[200:04.13]When they landed in their spaceship, Peter could be heard saying,
[200:29.12]You laughed at that.
[200:30.73]Don't even start with me.
[200:32.45]You laughed at that.
[200:35.17]I know a couple of you didn't.
[200:37.27]And you're like, fuck up.
[200:38.87]I didn't laugh at that shitty joke.
[200:41.71]But it's okay.
[200:47.09]Because I know for a fact that at least 100,000 of you did.
[200:49.13]Okay, can you...
[200:59.52]Don't ever go against technique.
[201:11.26]Any tinder rocks?
[201:12.02]Anybody see any?
[201:14.70]There's 5,000 people here.
[201:15.66]What do you mean?
[201:18.77]What did I say?
[201:32.88]Jawbreaker.
[201:33.38]Jeremiah, I see a tinted rock, do you?
[201:38.07]Are you making that up, or do you really see one?
[201:42.05]I don't see one.
[201:44.69]Oh no, he lost 95,000 viewers.
[201:45.35]That would be bad.
[202:10.80]This sucks.
[202:12.10]This sucks.
[202:13.66]Alright, eat him.
[202:15.70]Look, it's my guy versus your guy.
[202:18.00]You're a lot bigger and stronger, but mine has more perseverance.
[202:24.40]Get him.
[202:34.38]He is doing the rat emote.
[202:36.10]Good work.
[202:48.18]lot of you guys over here.
[202:49.08]Alright, you finish the job.
[202:55.64]Haha.
[202:58.68]That's two for two.
[203:16.46]I don't see a tinted rock.
[203:17.66]Thanks for the input.
[203:24.49]Full health.
[203:26.59]I think I'm going to do this shit.
[203:35.88]I think we're going to fucking be able to do this.
[203:48.40]Alright, bite him.
[203:49.42]Kill that one.
[203:49.94]I'll take out this one.
[203:50.70]You get this one.
[203:52.42]Kill him.
[203:54.72]Get him.
[203:56.40]Get him.
[203:57.56]Get him.
[204:04.19]Nice.
[204:04.37]Up there at top right.
[204:07.23]No tinted rocks.
[204:11.15]Name the leech.
[204:14.51]Okay, I'll name the leech.
[204:16.04]How about something that I would be able to remember?
[204:19.32]Something I can remember.
[204:22.04]Oh, here's something I could always remember.
[204:30.53]Star Tropics is a better game than Zelda.
[204:33.01]That could be his name.
[204:42.95]Easy to remember.
[204:57.54]He's never played Zelda.
[205:01.34]Watch out.
[205:01.98]What do I do?
[205:02.78]Oh, I don't know.
[205:03.42]Maybe... I can't get over there.
[205:14.21]Oh no!
[205:15.65]No!
[205:16.01]Oh, he's okay.
[205:17.74]I was gonna say, he's not my friend anymore.
[205:24.64]Oh my god, there's a teleporter.
[205:51.37]Blow it up, right?
[205:52.71]Blow up the head.
[205:56.40]Wow.
[206:09.02]You know what the Zelda game was?
[206:13.48]I'm being honest.
[206:14.04]I mean, Ocarina of Time is great.
[206:20.78]Um, I still play Breath of the Wild.
[206:37.36]Good.
[206:38.90]Keep up the pressure.
[206:42.76]Keep the pressure up.
[206:43.46]Don't even let him attack.
[206:44.32]Just keep the pressure up.
[206:48.42]Casino.
[206:54.51]Stream Breath of the Wild, please.
[206:57.27]I would probably really like it.
[207:04.14]Another dumb card that nobody wants.
[207:13.98]Speed up.
[207:15.70]I'll take it.
[207:16.08]Alright.
[207:20.98]Here we go.
[207:22.40]Give me some stuff.
[207:25.48]No, I want to blow these up.
[207:27.16]I don't even want to do anything.
[207:31.03]Oh, come on.
[207:37.13]I want money from these.
[207:38.23]It's like the game can't even hear me.
[207:43.43]Hello, can you hear me talk?
[207:44.39]I'm going for it.
[207:59.16]Come on!
[208:01.34]Ugh!
[208:09.03]She tried to step on his head.
[208:10.51]Fuck.
[208:14.48]She knew.
[208:19.28]I can come back with more money.
[208:29.06]Why can't I pick up these rocks?
[208:32.42]Pick it up, man.
[208:33.30]Pick up the rock!
[208:43.20]Where's my face cam?
[208:45.28]Sometimes I don't have my face cam on because I don't want to be on face cam.
[208:48.66]Sometimes I'm camera shy and I don't want to be on cam.
[208:52.48]Alright, finish the job.
[208:59.22]And yes, I don't have any clothes on.
[209:01.80]People think that's a joke.
[209:02.62]They really do.
[209:04.04]And that's fine.
[209:04.62]It's actually probably better that way that you think that that is just me messing around.
[209:09.42]But I am sitting here right now.
[209:11.74]I don't have a shirt on.
[209:12.82]And I'm in pajama pants.
[209:20.12]And you'll never know if that's true or not.
[209:21.36]You know what?
[209:23.86]No, fuck it.
[209:24.22]I'm wearing a suit.
[209:26.48]I'm in a tuxedo right now.
[209:35.36]Do I need to do this?
[209:36.04]Wait.
[209:37.06]Fires.
[209:37.48]Right?
[209:42.47]Fires, right?
[209:47.39]Holy shit.
[209:51.95]No?
[210:04.95]Where's this gonna take me?
[210:06.95]Ooh.
[210:07.93]Interesting.
[210:09.93]Interesting.
[210:13.59]Interesting.
[210:18.80]Aren't there?
[210:19.32]Oh, what the fuck?
[210:20.50]Why?
[210:20.92]What the?
[210:28.70]Oh, they shoot.
[210:29.45]I forgot the purple ones shoot too.
[210:31.29]It's just a net zero.
[210:38.59]Wink.
[210:38.89]I don't do winks anymore.
[210:42.15]I'm not that guy.
[210:43.63]I don't do that anymore.
[210:55.84]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[210:59.98]One more for the road.
[211:01.10]No.
[211:05.33]Is there a reason why I cannot pick up rocks anymore with this gauntlet?
[211:09.93]I can't pick up rocks.
[211:17.70]There's special rocks.
[211:23.44]I'm not talking to you until you wink.
[211:34.50]Are they gonna keep splitting?
[211:39.52]I'm gonna just... Come on.
[211:45.26]Do I actually have to do this?
[211:50.22]Focus.
[211:50.68]Good thing I got the bomb back.
[212:02.05]Oh my god, Manka.
[212:03.31]Oh my god, Manka, Omega!
[212:05.19]Oh my god, fucking Manka, Omega!
[212:13.50]Oh, I see what's going on.
[212:15.32]I see what's going on.
[212:16.50]Oh, you're not talking to me anymore.
[212:18.52]You're not talking to me anymore.
[212:19.94]I see.
[212:20.36]I see how it is.
[212:26.25]Not talking to me.
[212:27.55]Now I'm being silent.
[212:28.91]I don't want you to
[212:33.03]Hold on.
[212:33.37]Two hearts.
[212:34.91]Two spades.
[212:35.45]Just take it.
[212:35.89]32.
[212:35.93]Put the heart.
[212:38.08]Who cares?
[212:39.24]The hermit is the... Algalaz.
[212:42.56]The lovers.
[212:44.32]Explode now.
[212:45.46]What is this?
[212:46.12]Leo Stumpy.
[212:56.69]Oops.
[213:01.67]Nice!
[213:05.14]Not nice, actually.
[213:10.04]You guys can give me the silence for even all you want.
[213:17.49]The broken watch or something?
[213:18.71]Give me that part.
[213:19.63]I don't even care.
[213:27.48]I gotta kill like one or two more bosses anyways, right?
[213:34.08]Oh shit.
[213:49.09]Jerma, your mic's muted.
[213:50.73]So is yours.
[213:53.97]Let's see who cracks first.
[214:04.52]Oh, don't these guys look at you and just go like, REEEE! Yep.
[214:24.04]What do you want me to do?
[214:24.64]You want me to wink?
[214:26.62]No, I'm not going to have you guys be like a defiant, unruly baby.
[214:32.50]No, I am not going to do anything until you do this.
[214:34.66]Oh, don't move.
[214:50.43]Okay.
[214:50.61]That's good.
[214:52.05]I got it.
[214:53.18]He's three.
[214:57.34]Okay, they're all lit except for the... Okay, so it's all the ones in the middle.
[215:08.57]All the ones in the middle over here, and then a smiley face over here.
[215:11.95]That's it.
[215:14.70]All the ones in the middle over here, and then the smiley face, and that's it.
[215:18.90]Good.
[215:25.10]Guys, this is, we're never gonna end up, we're gonna have to come with some kind of compromise.
[215:29.53]Because there ain't no fucking way in hell I'm putting clothes on right now.
[215:33.83]So.
[215:41.69]Wait.
[215:51.52]There ain't a chance in hell.
[215:58.87]Oh my god, I can't believe I got hit.
[216:11.75]You guys are really into this.
[216:13.59]Alright, is it next floor or is it this floor?
[216:15.33]Somebody's gonna crack and tell me.
[216:16.89]It's the next floor, right?
[216:19.07]One of you's gonna crack.
[216:21.15]One of you's gonna crack and tell me.
[216:28.20]Next floor, right?
[216:29.52]Yep.
[216:30.30]It's the next floor.
[216:31.20]Yep.
[216:31.66]Thanks for that one person.
[216:34.75]Good job.
[216:35.97]I know I have a bunch of fucking, like, supporters in here.
[216:43.95]It's... Wait.
[217:18.00]I don't even need it.
[217:20.28]It's already open.
[217:23.67]Oops!
[217:24.09]I didn't get the... I didn't get the thing I needed to grab.
[217:45.04]He's being reckless.
[217:55.52]I win the challenge.
[217:56.40]I win the challenge.
[217:57.34]I win the challenge.
[217:58.30]I win the... Oh, fucking great.
[218:07.32]The game crashed.
[218:20.73]They're starting to crack.
[218:22.61]Fuck.
[218:24.90]What?
[218:25.74]Alright.
[218:28.44]Let me go back in.
[218:29.20]Is that going to kill my game?
[218:34.17]This happened last time too.
[218:35.17]What's going on at this point?
[218:37.81]This is bullshit.
[218:48.17]Continue.
[218:51.78]Isaac sides with chat.
[218:57.01]Um, I have to do this all over again.
[219:07.13]Come on, really?
[219:07.91]I beat the boss.
[219:10.31]Why wouldn't it shave there?
[219:11.63]I don't even want to do this.
[219:14.86]I already have everything I need.
[219:16.26]Where was the boss?
[219:18.02]I'm just gonna crack.
[219:20.82]I don't remember.
[219:21.32]It was over here somewhere, right?
[219:22.42]I don't fucking remember.
[219:26.15]It really should shave though, it's unfortunate that it doesn't.
[219:34.86]Don't tell him?
[219:35.38]Fine, I'll just get there wicked quick.
[220:11.24]Good outcome.
[220:15.90]$50 from chunky baloney 5000 bits.
[220:19.20]Holy shit!
[220:22.46]And they say... Nothing.
[220:26.62]They say dot, dot, dot.
[220:28.86]That's it.
[220:38.97]Takes the 50 fucking dollars.
[220:49.23]Wiggle worm?
[220:51.01]Oh, that's too bad.
[220:57.41]Where's my validation?
[221:02.01]You will accept if I say shpee.
[221:04.61]No, I'm sorry.
[221:05.92]Why don't you give in to demands?
[221:09.78]I'm not giving in to demands.
[221:11.54]That's over for me.
[221:12.68]I'll never be able to... I'll have no negotiating power for the rest of the time I have a livestream.
[221:24.04]I'm not getting into your demands.
[221:53.84]$50 from 5,000 bits from Goiki.
[221:57.83]Goiki, $50 from two people in a row, which is huge amounts of fucking money.
[222:02.48]Goiki says...
[222:04.92]Hey Jerma, just really happy that you're playing Binding of Isaac.
[222:07.12]It's one of my favorite games ever made.
[222:09.12]And it is very exciting that the new expansion is coming out, although sad that it is going to be the last one.
[222:17.46]That's true.
[222:19.08]Anyways, thanks for the content over the years.
[222:21.44]Really appreciate everything you do.
[222:24.00]And chat doing the silent act thing is really, really, really childish.
[222:28.36]And I can't wait to at least stop doing it.
[222:30.38]Thank you, Glicky.
[222:31.00]Appreciate that.
[222:34.43]Thanks.
[222:34.63]The $50 is a lot of money.
[222:39.58]Two diamonds.
[222:41.24]Hold on.
[222:41.64]Okay.
[222:44.36]Hold this.
[222:48.00]I need money and I'm coming back.
[222:58.14]Alright.
[222:58.36]Don't fuck that up.
[223:02.49]Chat's cracking.
[223:04.43]I think I can last longer than chat can.
[223:10.23]Guys, come on.
[223:11.38]You're referring to a group of people that, if I spend more than eight minutes on a tutorial, they freak the fuck out.
[223:17.46]I think I can outlast them.
[223:25.46]Piece three.
[223:29.58]Where's piece two?
[223:35.44]Tinted rock.
[223:36.42]We've got a cracker.
[223:38.10]We've got a cracker.
[223:39.88]Thanks a lot.
[223:42.96]Ah, more health for me.
[223:44.81]Thank you.
[223:47.81]We've got a chat crack.
[224:02.52]No, what the fuck?
[224:04.80]No, like you've cracked!
[224:06.62]You've cracked!
[224:07.44]Alright, I gotta kill the boss.
[224:30.50]You cracked!
[224:42.56]Oh, fuck.
[224:44.36]Wow, Isaac!
[225:11.86]Okay, Polaroid.
[225:14.12]Oh my god, my eyes are wicked itchy.
[225:28.48]And...
[225:44.14]Alright, moving on.
[225:45.78]I can't believe this is gonna be the last Jerma stream.
[225:52.01]What are you talking about?
[225:56.01]Alright, fine.
[225:57.61]Alright, we got 50... We got 50... 5,000 bits from Red Planet of Mars.
[226:08.83]Who says, Hi chat, will you at least say hi to me, please?
[226:16.25]That's $50.
[226:16.77]Hi.
[226:18.77]Hi.
[226:18.99]Hi.
[226:22.03]No.
[226:22.59]Hi.
[226:23.51]Oh, there you go.
[226:24.03]Thanks for the $5,000.
[226:24.99]That's a lot of fucking money.
[226:26.77]Thanks for the $50 fucking bucks.
[226:35.16]And then an anonymous cheerer.
[226:38.12]gave 5,000 bits as well.
[226:40.02]200 fucking dolls and bits have come in in the last five minutes.
[226:45.16]I thought you guys were supposed to be being defiant.
[226:46.63]You're paying me tons of money.
[226:50.19]You're rewarding me.
[226:57.73]They're pity bits.
[227:11.76]get a chance.
[227:12.28]Fucking idiot.
[227:14.22]Fucking idiot.
[227:14.84]Fucking idiot.
[227:15.46]Fucking idiot.
[227:16.88]Fucking idiot.
[227:19.52]Five community subs from Arison.
[227:22.20]Arison.
[227:23.64]We also had five community subs from StraightPube and SuperBruce.
[227:28.69]Both gave five community subs.
[227:34.29]Don't tell me what.
[227:37.71]Don't tell him.
[227:38.55]Don't tell him.
[227:55.59]Don't move.
[227:57.43]People just giving money and doing dot, dot, dots.
[228:04.57]Defiant chat.
[228:06.47]Were you there the day that chat finally was defiant to the streamer?
[228:11.98]Were you there?
[228:14.06]And they didn't crack?
[228:16.38]Except for one person cracked.
[228:19.44]They cracked.
[228:22.68]How do I get through this?
[228:25.35]What the fuck?
[228:32.00]Will you dare today?
[228:32.96]Will you dare today?
[228:33.80]I'm gonna lose in here.
[228:46.85]What?
[228:53.36]Use the suicide king.
[228:54.84]Oh, yeah.
[228:55.82]Um, sure.
[228:59.28]The thing that has suicide in its name is the thing I'm going to use right now.
[229:10.82]We're winning.
[229:11.54]There's no competition here.
[229:15.50]Alright, if I promise, I'll give you a wink at the end of the stream.
[229:22.57]Can we go back to the way it was?
[229:24.03]Can we go back to the way that it was before?
[229:26.85]Okay, and what if I lie to you?
[229:32.56]And I don't.
[229:33.74]Then what happens?
[229:43.03]We'll never trust you ever again.
[229:50.87]Well.
[229:52.30]A chance that we are all gonna have to take.
[229:54.19]Open your mouth.
[230:04.06]I'm dead.
[230:04.96]I'm dead.
[230:05.30]I don't think I'm gonna make it through this.
[230:09.92]I've been too distracted.
[230:12.90]With all this nonsense going on in my chatroom.
[230:15.77]I've been very distracted.
[230:29.18]I know how to get you guys to crack.
[230:35.71]You see, if there was ever a thing to make everyone command me to stop, it would be hearing the Bane impression.
[230:50.93]Maybe I'll do this for the remainder of the stream.
[231:02.09]I'm not bringing out that one.
[231:03.17]I'm not bringing out the A word.
[231:07.19]Sorry.

[236:10.51]You guys have been giving a shitload.
[236:12.73]Like always, and... All I can say is thanks.
[236:17.94]And that Star Tropic is a better game than Zelda.
[236:20.70]So, I mean... That's all I have with me right now.
[236:23.78]That's all I can say.
[236:28.92]Don't you dare.
[236:29.46]What?
[236:40.70]No, you don't get two.
[236:42.14]That's the thing.
[236:42.80]You don't get two.
[236:51.97]Zelda is better!
[236:52.95]Zelda is better!
[236:53.69]You know what's a better game than both of them?
[236:57.85]Solitaire.
[236:59.95]Been around for like 600 years.
[237:12.15]Come on, I gotta get one more good run.
[237:14.33]I wanna just beat like Satan again.
[237:16.83]Or, perhaps Mega Satan.
[237:19.21]If I can get there.
[237:19.97]Yeah, I want a Mega Satan run.
[237:27.22]We're going down.
[237:28.16]When are you gonna play Solitaire?
[237:33.82]I actually don't know how to play Solitaire.
[237:37.78]I have no idea.
[237:39.06]I just pretend like I know how to play, and then I put, like, some of those cards... I have no idea how to play.
[237:47.47]I know you just, you go, like, up.
[237:48.83]I don't get it.
[237:49.45]Like, I get it, but I don't.
[237:50.97]You go, like... Is that bad?
[237:54.49]I understand it's like you go, okay, you have to go in order.
[237:57.72]But I don't understand the rows.
[237:59.22]And I understand, like, the deck at the top, you just, like, you click it, and it gives you a bunch of new cards.
[238:04.62]You have to take that card and put... I don't get it.
[238:06.74]I swear to God, I don't know.
[238:07.84]I've never... I don't play it.
[238:08.80]First charge shot.
[238:17.93]Kind of not good.
[238:22.85]It's kind of not good at all.
[238:25.75]It only works because I have the penetration.
[238:32.90]This is not a restart yet.
[238:33.84]Not yet.
[238:36.54]If I didn't have penetration, it would be.
[238:37.72]I'm alright.
[238:42.69]This is not terrible.
[238:55.83]Whack.
[238:57.57]Whack.
[239:11.27]See?
[239:11.70]It's better.
[239:13.94]It could be really, really bad.
[239:15.34]But it's not.
[239:16.60]It's not.
[239:18.12]It's good.
[239:27.26]Ooh, I see another tinted rock.
[239:32.52]Is this going on with my hair?
[239:33.58]What do you mean?
[239:45.54]This item is so bad.
[239:49.28]But there's a chance that I'll be able to get, like, quad tears or something.
[239:52.59]It's possible.
[239:53.15]A lot of tinted rocks.
[239:58.38]Okay.
[239:59.42]It... That's pretty good.
[240:05.48]Okay, and I got a... Come on.
[240:07.85]Like, that's pretty good.
[240:17.31]I'm gonna investigate a little more.
[240:18.51]Find a pog, I guess.
[240:23.06]Find a pog, I guess.
[240:25.90]Yeah.
[240:27.18]Yeah.
[240:32.89]Where did that come from?
[240:34.59]Oh, that kind of pog, I guess.
[240:35.98]I guess.
[240:41.82]There's been a tinted rock in almost every single room.
[240:47.25]Whatever, it's not a big deal.
[240:50.85]Not a big deal at all.
[241:02.24]Pressed it really slowly.
[241:13.06]That was a kind of hog, I guess.
[241:15.54]Not a big deal at all, wasn't it?
[241:25.29]I guess.
[241:37.39]Somebody just called the gay guys the Wink Dinks.
[241:41.85]Hold on.
[241:42.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[241:42.53]I need to read this.
[241:44.25]Mitchell comes in and says, The worst part isn't that they now have footage of you winking in a bathrobe, but that the Wink Dinks think their solidarity action will get them everything now.
[241:53.58]Good luck, Jeremy.
[241:54.16]Love you.
[241:54.40]Streams.
[241:57.50]That's what I was afraid of.
[241:59.30]But it's okay.
[241:59.84]Remember.
[242:01.02]All I have to do is just wave my magic fucking wand.
[242:05.84]And they'll just- I can make them disappear.
[242:20.61]What?!
[242:28.09]Stop!
[242:28.77]What the fuck is- Oh, it's the cursed charged shot.
[242:34.37]Oh, this really is the shittiest item in the game, isn't it?
[242:40.69]Link Dinks.
[242:41.77]Well, here's the thing.
[242:43.43]You just gave them a nickname that they're going to repeat and love and they're gonna cherish it and they're gonna say it.
[242:49.18]They're gonna be the Link Dinks now.
[242:53.10]And I bet you they can't wait to... Yeah, now they have a name.
[243:02.28]oh my god I can't even dink I'm not gonna I can't handle that I'm getting free money
[243:45.13]There we go!
[243:47.94]There we go!
[243:50.36]Hey, any dinks in chat?
[244:03.40]Close it up.
[244:08.67]So yeah, City Skylands is what we would do later on this week.
[244:11.09]If you were curious.
[244:13.67]This is new.
[244:14.51]It's a new item.
[244:19.71]All stats up.
[244:22.15]Super Meat Boy Fan?
[244:28.15]Oh.
[244:29.51]That's cool.
[244:30.79]That's not bad.
[244:35.06]At least we're over four, almost five damage.
[244:37.18]Right at the very beginning.
[244:43.05]Did somebody wink the dinksters?
[244:50.27]I'm glad you guys are having fun.
[244:51.85]I'm glad you're having fun.
[244:59.22]What about me?
[244:59.72]Don't I get to have fun?
[245:01.00]Don't I get to have any...
[245:04.60]Where's my... Where's my, like... Where's my dink winker?
[245:07.42]Ooh, this item's great.
[245:20.03]Actually, good item.
[245:27.02]Wait, no it's not.
[245:28.52]Hold on.
[245:29.84]This is... This is not the moment you collect the bugs and you can have five...
[245:34.59]Oh.
[245:34.71]I thought this was the one where if you kill things, you collect it and you can release them.
[245:47.28]What does this thing do?
[245:47.94]It collects... I see a tinted rock.
[246:05.07]Where?
[246:05.31]Where do you see one?
[246:14.99]No, he's fucking with me.
[246:20.06]In the shop?
[246:28.78]Oh, okay.
[246:29.58]I can't even do anything about it.
[246:43.44]Ooooooooh.
[246:47.94]Wink.
[246:54.35]Okay.
[247:04.07]Not very good.
[247:09.25]Wait, somebody's asked me if they could have my Skype.
[247:23.33]Oh, who uses Skype?
[247:47.51]Bugle fairy, get on Skype.
[248:19.34]Scissors.
[248:20.52]Lose your head.
[248:26.53]Wow, that item is very, very bad.
[248:32.05]What a bad item.
[248:33.41]Doesn't even do anything.
[248:34.63]It's not even as good as the empty jar.
[248:37.67]I don't even know what the jar does.
[248:50.32]Six room recharge.
[248:51.38]Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[248:54.55]Is it just me?
[248:56.00]Or have we been getting some really, really, really foul finding of Isaac seeds?
[249:03.70]I'm getting some pretty foul ones.
[249:12.07]Is it just me?
[249:16.49]Why did I just use that right there?
[249:19.07]There was no reason to do that.
[249:21.91]Oh, wait, I gotta do the jar.
[249:24.03]I have one heart in the jar?
[249:25.47]How many can you put in there?
[249:26.25]Bugleberry calling you on Skype.
[249:35.70]Pick up.
[249:37.76]How much can you put in here?
[249:38.56]Four?
[249:39.16]You guys said this item was bad.
[249:41.92]This thing's actually pretty good.
[249:44.92]What's wrong with this thing?
[249:54.19]Why were we getting so many antipods when I collected this?
[250:19.55]The Bionic Isaac is so fun.
[250:21.05]It really is just a fun game.
[250:22.29]It really reminds me of another game that I like that's a good game.
[250:32.18]Serious Sam 3.
[250:33.00]Why is he so big?
[250:54.76]Do you know how many times I've thought Sirius Sam and Duke Nukem were the same game?
[251:03.36]Up until like 2008 or 2009 or so, I thought they were the same game.
[251:10.92]Okay, what's in here?
[251:59.87]I got the nail.
[252:00.73]Everybody can relax.
[252:02.25]Why is it a spirit heart, though?
[252:03.67]I thought it was devil hearts.
[252:15.42]You can't beat Mega Satan now.
[252:18.52]Why not?
[252:27.15]Not with that attitude.
[252:30.94]Oh man, just... I can break the fucking rocks!
[252:40.99]You know, there's no barriers!
[252:43.61]There are no barriers!
[252:45.17]Why do I keep acting like there's barriers in place?
[252:48.88]I'm not restarting, I don't need to.
[252:54.30]I'm acting like I have to- I'm constrained.
[253:06.91]You need access to the angel rooms.
[253:08.19]Oh, right.
[253:08.75]That's true.
[253:10.65]Well, it's alright.
[253:14.47]Start thinking about what our city skyline name is going to be for the town.
[253:19.29]When I come back later this week, I'm going to have an efficient, awesome town.
[253:27.19]Did you ever meet Bill?
[253:31.19]Uh, I don't know.
[253:33.86]I don't know about that one.
[253:43.45]I can't get over there.
[253:47.63]Nobody said that!
[253:55.22]Let's wait.
[254:02.22]Wink dink city!
[254:19.94]Fighters.
[254:21.00]Watch out.
[254:26.62]Wink dink city.
[254:37.60]Access to the nail.
[254:40.54]There's no... Nothing in here to break.
[254:46.35]That almost just got me.
[254:51.14]That almost just got me.
[254:52.12]Except that just barely got me, Odell.
[254:58.81]Except that just got me, Odell.
[255:14.41]Tinted rock?
[255:18.23]What are you talking about?
[255:19.55]There's no tinted rock?
[255:21.63]Pay attention, boomer!
[255:23.87]Where's there a tinted rock in this?
[255:24.95]Ohhh!
[255:26.33]Good thing I opened it.
[255:31.38]Now I don't have access to the nail.
[255:47.33]Holy fuck, I almost just hurt myself.
[255:51.68]Two bombs?
[255:53.34]Ooh.
[256:05.57]Relax, man.
[256:10.41]Attention.
[256:12.77]We got big damage now.
[256:14.05]7.18.
[256:14.07]I'm going to keep looking around.
[256:24.94]folks right now we made emergency surgery in the studio why is that on my mind they're all free all the chests are free
[257:03.02]I love these things.
[257:04.76]These little guys?
[257:08.90]Gerties?
[257:09.30]What are they called?
[257:09.82]Little Gerties?
[257:10.95]Mini Gerties?
[257:27.01]Tech point five.
[257:28.29]It's still being tested.
[257:39.24]So wait, I get to keep my tears, but I also get lasers?
[257:47.34]That's really good.
[257:52.63]That's really, really good.
[257:54.67]Wow, okay.
[257:57.81]We might have a run in the bag here.
[257:58.97]Good tech.
[258:01.84]I just gotta learn it.
[258:09.69]Another room, too.
[258:10.47]We get free doors.
[258:11.23]Oh, f*** you.
[258:19.72]Flatworm?
[258:22.04]Nice!
[258:23.86]Oh, I can still use it.
[258:26.61]Wait, what happens if you combine tech .5 with tech 2?
[258:30.97]What if you do both techs?
[258:34.05]What happens?
[258:36.77]That's too much tech?
[258:39.48]That's tech one.
[258:40.34]This is tech one.
[258:52.17]A stack?
[258:53.93]Do it, do it, do it.
[258:54.83]Do I lose .5G?
[258:59.53]I wonder what happens if I get...
[259:03.07]Take it, moron.
[259:04.85]It's Omega Tears.
[259:06.35]Omega Lasers.
[259:07.23]It's worse.
[259:08.76]No, they stack.
[259:13.06]Why would you lose it?
[259:14.34]Take it and find out.
[259:15.18]At least tell us the seed.
[259:18.90]This one.
[259:21.29]Just Google it, you fool.
[259:22.45]What are you guys doing?
[259:53.73]A few seconds.
[259:56.57]Oh, that's unbelievably funny.
[259:59.41]Unbelievably fucking funny.
[260:02.79]They came for a few seconds.
[260:08.78]But that means that it was in the brain at some point during the development.
[260:14.96]It was up there somewhere.
[260:16.02]He's had experience.
[260:22.47]Why did I just walk into this?
[260:25.01]Whoa, it's doing triple lasers.
[260:43.73]This is so good.
[260:44.67]Look at this shit.
[260:48.87]It's open every door.
[260:49.59]Who cares?
[260:50.03]This game is so good.
[260:53.39]Do I get the eraser?
[261:01.24]Do I get the bra?
[261:02.24]What does the bra do?
[261:03.42]Fogo bombs.
[261:06.54]Oh.
[261:07.86]Buy one... Oh.
[261:24.32]And that's gonna get annoying.
[261:25.20]Money printer go brrrr.
[261:57.08]Why did I just say that?
[261:58.26]I don't know, because somebody wrote it.
[262:02.46]Oh, it's the two plebs.
[262:03.56]What are these guys' names?
[262:05.41]The two plebs!
[262:27.03]I just need tears up.
[262:28.05]Thank you.
[262:28.93]Thank you.
[262:29.79]Thank you.
[262:30.41]Oh, that's not very good.
[262:31.34]It's only 0.63.
[262:31.86]I thought it was tears up.
[262:40.93]Carrion Queen.
[262:57.20]Term of my queen.
[262:58.40]You guys are fucking crazy.
[263:13.46]Yeah, I've seen the tweet.
[263:14.47]I've seen the tweet.
[263:15.07]And please, I don't want to have to... Obviously, this is very, very basic info.
[263:22.69]But please do not harass anybody or spam a developer of a game because we're having a little fun here.
[263:31.24]Let's be real about that.
[263:32.26]You know what I'm saying?
[263:44.67]He was doing a Q&A.
[263:54.12]I can't even... I can't even say something that's like nice and good now.
[264:04.31]He's doing an AMA.
[264:07.93]Guys, stop harassing this guy.
[264:09.65]He's like doing an AMA at the moment.
[264:12.38]Oh my god.
[264:22.06]I'm fucking done.
[264:23.50]I'm done.
[264:23.95]I'm done.
[264:25.31]Okay, this is a really good build.
[264:27.13]I gotta play.
[264:34.45]This is like a guaranteed kill Satan run.
[264:38.06]Chat just can't stop winning right now.
[264:46.06]Where's I supposed to go?
[264:49.82]Running out of steam here.
[264:56.51]I just can't stop winning.
[264:57.91]There it is.
[265:03.67]And there it is.
[265:07.41]And there it is.
[265:12.47]I don't know what this is.
[265:13.25]I'm waiting for other people to be excited about it.
[265:15.39]So then they'll say what it is in the chat and I'll just pretend that I know.
[265:25.01]This is... I don't... I take less damage.
[265:27.41]Block shots.
[265:28.51]Okay.
[265:28.75]I don't like these.
[265:43.57]Ooh, it did block it.
[265:51.63]Holy shit.
[265:52.59]That was the motherlode.
[265:57.39]Chance to not take damage.
[265:58.25]That's pretty good.
[266:02.39]Don't run too fast.
[266:05.43]That's a mega chest.
[266:13.77]Watch out!
[266:18.00]What is it?
[266:18.28]I don't know.
[266:18.62]Drugs.
[266:19.06]Good.
[266:29.67]First skull.
[266:30.33]First.
[266:34.87]I really do need health though.
[266:35.88]This is bad.
[266:43.80]Left hand.
[266:44.22]Left hand.
[266:45.12]Dark rewards.
[266:46.92]Drop it!
[266:47.42]Drop it!
[266:47.92]Drop it!
[266:49.19]What?
[267:15.97]Oh, I did it.
[267:16.53]It's been five years.
[267:17.46]Oh, yay.
[267:42.21]Fuck.
[267:42.67]I need- Oh, this is really bad.
[267:45.43]I keep getting like hit by shit.
[268:19.14]Jeremy, use your fucking item!
[268:21.40]Oh!
[268:24.69]Jeremy, use your fucking item!
[268:39.37]He's throwing again.
[268:40.21]No, I'm just, like, hanging out with chat and, like, listening to you guys and, like, hanging out with you.
[268:44.75]Right?
[268:45.31]Come on.
[268:45.99]Who cares about... I'm hanging out with you guys.
[268:49.80]We're hanging out here.
[268:50.58]We're having a good time, you and I. The two of us.
[268:55.22]Plus the other 5,098 people.
[268:56.21]It's just us here.
[269:12.58]Alright, I'm gonna focus.
[269:26.57]Don't pick that up.
[269:29.63]Hold on.
[269:31.11]Please.
[269:35.20]Please do it.
[269:38.96]Come on.
[269:40.60]Oh!
[269:41.06]Why?! !
[269:42.65]Every time I'm gonna record a sneeze for fucking soundboard playback, it screws up.
[269:48.77]I psych myself out of being able having to sneeze.
[269:50.89]Oh my god, I'm itching my face.
[270:02.88]Why is my face so itchy right now?
[270:04.28]Of all the times to be itchy right now, it has to be right now?
[270:20.64]HP and luck.
[270:21.94]Good.
[270:22.18]You're making me look like an asshole.
[270:31.97]Nice.
[270:36.64]What we're looking for is... We're looking for the... We're looking for the guppy.
[270:40.10]The guppy cruncher.
[270:42.20]The real good guppy cruncher.
[270:45.38]What you do is you put these... You put this dog shit down here.
[270:52.96]I like to pretend it's my granddaughter's wedding.
[270:59.06]So anyways, I keep picking up dog shit.
[271:00.88]I wonder how many of you guys know that.
[271:15.72]Wow.
[271:16.48]We've got... Ding, ding, ding.
[271:17.50]We've got a winner.
[271:19.57]We got a winner.
[271:21.93]We got a winner.
[271:30.86]Good.
[271:31.82]Good.
[271:32.82]Easy.
[271:33.06]Blow that up.
[271:42.16]Ooh.
[271:49.33]Secret without even needing to know.
[271:51.19]And it's Greed.
[271:56.40]Use your fucking item.
[272:00.48]I will.
[272:01.68]Right now.
[272:02.56]Not right now.
[272:08.99]Right now.
[272:13.87]Then it'll charge again and I can use it again.
[272:22.26]Item used.
[272:25.20]Hmm.
[272:35.95]Lots of these chests.
[272:37.97]I'm going to get... Come on, push up.
[272:42.22]Can I get Guppy?
[272:42.98]Is there a chance that I could actually get Guppy?
[272:49.92]Kind of.
[272:50.54]Maybe a little.
[272:51.76]Small.
[272:57.88]I'm never going up in that room again.
[273:23.07]I'll use it.
[273:23.89]Don't worry.
[273:26.19]I want tears up.
[273:27.45]Tears up would make this unbeatable.
[273:29.39]It'd be great.
[273:29.99]It'd be amazing.
[273:34.49]Well.
[273:36.21]Come on.
[273:42.88]I love when it goes...
[274:04.75]The fucking item.
[274:06.63]I'm going to grab... That's like a word you're trying to get me to say.
[274:13.93]I don't know what the hell it is.
[274:24.19]Tear shot.
[274:25.75]No.
[274:26.39]I need... Tear's up.
[274:31.31]Please.
[274:31.99]Please.
[274:39.57]It's like a double shot.
[274:41.33]It would happen so many times.
[274:43.21]Please give it to me.
[274:46.52]Do a little bit of casino then.
[274:47.58]He's not grabbing the... I'm not going to say it.
[274:52.58]I don't know what it is.
[275:00.83]I can't even get by this.
[275:02.17]I'm blowing it up anyways.
[275:20.83]Alright, I'm in a good spot.
[275:33.14]Slot machine go brr.
[275:34.66]I don't think that works here.
[275:44.62]Go up.
[275:46.52]Secret room right here.
[275:47.78]Guaranteed or I will...
[275:51.01]Sit back down in my chair and forget I talked.
[275:53.01]Look at all this damage.
[276:00.81]Ooh, we're killing Satan tonight.
[276:02.63]Too bad it's not going to be Mega Satan.
[276:31.75]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[276:37.25]What the fuck?
[276:39.89]Left or right?
[276:41.02]Left.
[276:42.42]Polaroid.
[276:42.94]Oh, it's just a Polaroid.
[276:44.10]Alright.
[276:44.74]Uh-oh.
[276:47.88]Let's take a guess.
[276:54.32]Top piece of collar.
[276:56.87]And... We need to go deeper.
[276:59.75]Fucking worst item in the game.
[277:13.57]Throwing?
[277:14.23]I'm not throwing.
[277:14.82]I'll have... I'm gonna begin... Check this out.
[277:24.10]Throwing.
[277:30.87]Rock.
[277:32.99]There's no rocks in this room.
[277:43.55]Uh, it's Pinhead, whatever his name is.
[277:45.37]Yep.
[277:48.65]Pray to me.
[277:56.53]Pinwheel.
[277:57.09]Uh, I don't want that.
[278:02.84]I have the... I have the, um, the guppy generator.
[278:09.94]The cursed chest thing.
[278:10.68]I want to keep that.
[278:19.33]Give me a break.
[278:20.01]Give me a break.
[278:26.31]Oh, no, no, no!
[278:31.17]No, no!
[278:32.29]Yeah!
[278:34.19]No, no, no.
[278:34.75]Are you prepared, huh?
[278:35.57]I was just doing no more heroes, enemies.
[278:38.31]My spleen!
[278:49.70]What just hit me?
[278:50.20]Alright, I gotta pay attention again.
[279:02.34]No, no, no!
[279:05.02]I can't get over it.
[279:06.02]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[279:08.18]Don't answer that.
[279:25.16]No tinted rocks.
[279:27.44]Nope.
[279:29.64]Hate these things.
[279:38.89]No rock.
[279:42.99]Fuck!
[279:43.97]Did I get the scratch in my face again?
[279:45.27]I'm still gonna do this, don't worry.
[279:48.97]I refuse to let this fall.
[279:53.41]I refuse to have this be a fall down.
[279:55.29]You know what I mean?
[279:55.71]Be a failure.
[279:56.15]I mean, what was I supposed to do there?
[280:08.64]What was I supposed to do there?
[280:11.93]Use your fucking item.
[280:19.70]There it is.
[280:20.92]There it is.
[280:21.24]There it is.
[280:21.86]There it is.
[280:22.16]There it is.
[280:24.22]Oh, yes.
[280:24.66]Yes.
[280:24.96]Yes.
[280:25.22]Coming back.
[280:25.66]Coming back.
[280:26.10]Coming back.
[280:26.46]We're coming back.
[280:32.95]Game over.
[280:35.89]Game over.
[280:36.43]Guppy achieved.
[280:47.99]Let's go.
[280:55.13]Melt.
[280:56.61]Melt egg.
[280:58.87]And a goat head.
[281:02.21]And... I don't want it.
[281:06.91]This is good enough.
[281:10.56]I don't want it.
[281:11.36]I don't want it.
[281:12.20]I don't want it.
[281:16.48]I'm not taking it.
[281:17.08]I don't want it.
[281:25.52]This is a really good room.
[281:31.25]I have Guppy, guys.
[281:32.55]I'm invincible.
[281:48.17]Guppy flies, right.

[282:51.61]I'm feeling the true power.
[282:54.95]Ow!
[282:55.57]I forgot that he's exploded.
[283:04.66]Pill.
[283:05.18]We instantly take every pill in every single run.
[283:08.55]Well, there you go.
[283:10.05]Boom.
[283:12.89]Oh!
[283:16.53]Drop left hand.
[283:17.31]It ruins chests.
[283:18.37]Drop left hand.
[283:19.25]What the hell do I care?
[283:24.53]I'm guppy.
[283:33.53]I can't- I can't drop it.
[283:34.93]How do you drop an item?
[283:37.92]Drop left hand.
[283:38.66]I can't... How do you... I can't throw it... What?
[283:40.74]The first G?
[283:44.24]If control... Hold control... It doesn't do anything.
[283:56.94]Control.
[284:04.90]That doesn't do anything.
[284:05.54]You guys... What are you talking about?
[284:08.85]Did you change bindings?
[284:09.95]No, he said I'm gonna... No.
[284:11.91]Are you sure?
[284:12.67]This is anti-birth.
[284:19.79]No, I'm fine.
[284:20.43]Left ult.
[284:36.20]Left ult.
[284:42.18]No?
[284:53.05]Hold the map button.
[285:07.38]One of the triggers for the controller.
[285:10.02]Left trigger.
[285:14.50]Left bumper.
[285:15.84]It's a bomb.
[285:30.91]Did I actually get fucking hit?
[285:33.77]Alright, we're going down or up?
[285:36.78]Down or up?
[285:37.86]Begotten baby.
[285:38.66]Down or up?
[285:39.08]Should I go up or down?
[285:40.10]Up or down?
[285:40.86]Up or down?
[285:41.62]Up or down?
[285:49.43]I don't want that.
[285:49.87]Let's go up!
[286:07.50]I tried to move.
[286:09.15]He's throwing.
[286:13.11]I'm not throwing.
[286:13.59]I'm gonna kill Isaac in fucking a tenth of a second.
[286:31.79]Drop the hand.
[286:32.97]There's no... I don't know.
[286:34.13]I can't.
[286:42.61]Kill it.
[286:42.93]Kill it.
[286:43.27]Kill it.
[286:49.91]It's right trigger.
[286:53.61]Don't touch that.
[286:54.47]I don't want that.
[286:56.46]Right trigger?
[287:01.98]It's right trigger got it Why would I I'm not you don't get double guppy I'm already guppy It's only take it.

[287:36.71]Ooh.
[287:38.31]Platinum.
[287:42.24]Judas's tongue.
[287:50.73]Judas's tongue.
[287:51.53]Payment received.
[288:02.33]Free devil deals?
[288:06.93]Fuck, I'm dodging all over the place and I even get hit by it.
[288:09.14]God damn it, that's annoying.
[288:10.64]Oh, hello.
[288:32.61]You can have every single cent.
[288:34.07]You can have it all.
[288:36.69]Take it all from me.
[288:39.27]Thanks to the bombs.
[288:45.60]HP up.
[288:50.22]This feels so good when you get a build like this and you can just... Ooh, don't touch.
[288:53.80]Alright, let's go.
[288:57.12]Isaac.
[288:59.52]Isaac.
[289:28.37]I thought you were Isaac.
[289:29.27]What the heck?
[289:30.49]Um, no.
[289:32.37]I'm not.
[289:34.55]Done.
[289:35.31]Goodbye.
[289:36.45]Continue.
[289:40.00]Too bad I don't have the... no keys or anything.
[289:48.62]Hold on.
[289:49.26]That's another technology.
[289:54.00]That's all of them.
[289:54.81]I got all of them.
[289:56.53]Technology 2.
[290:00.74]Holy shit.
[290:03.04]Oh my god.
[290:03.87]It's all the techs.
[290:06.21]And damage on them.
[290:07.07]And HP.
[290:09.39]And a piggy bank.
[290:11.85]This is all the technologies.
[290:13.04]Triple, triple taser.
[290:14.88]And guppy.
[290:15.82]I don't think I'll ever have a cooler build than this ever again.
[290:22.38]And it's fear shot.
[290:38.63]I feel like I'm doing less damage.
[290:42.65]Am I doing less damage?
[290:47.99]I am.
[290:52.37]That's very un-POG.
[290:58.08]I think I'm too old to be saying that.
[291:00.00]You know what I mean?
[291:00.54]I think I'm a little too old for saying the word POG.
[291:03.54]What do you think?
[291:05.42]Is it working?
[291:06.90]Is it working?
[291:12.80]Is it working?
[291:13.94]When I'm like, oh, Pog.
[291:14.84]Are you guys like, shut up.
[291:16.52]Or is it like, dude, he said it.
[291:24.60]You're never too old to Pog.
[291:26.50]Yeah.
[291:27.68]That's good to know.
[291:33.58]This is cool to see this all together, though.
[291:41.11]Rocks don't stand a chance.
[291:42.15]Eh.
[291:50.78]Did I kill the last boss with the Germicraft?
[291:55.44]Okay, that's just a troll room.
[292:07.15]Why do I even collect the bombs right now?
[292:08.51]I don't even need them.
[292:24.55]Ooh, the seven deadly sins in the same room at the same time.
[292:39.47]Don't want it.
[292:40.19]It really wants me to grab that, huh?
[292:53.71]Almost there.
[292:59.73]Look at that, oh yeah
[293:29.34]Ooh!
[293:30.42]Big, beautiful fly.
[293:31.74]Wait, is this a Bob's brain?
[293:35.54]This is a Bob's brain that just floats around.
[293:37.12]But thank God I'm like halfway... Halfway!
[293:39.66]Thank God I'm like done with this playthrough.
[293:44.65]Golden touch.
[293:56.90]Nothing in there.
[293:58.54]Where is this place?
[294:02.75]Oh, we're doing a copypasta now.
[294:04.45]I see.
[294:13.46]I'm not picking it up.
[294:24.10]At this point, I'm playing Diablo and just walking by all the rares and uniques that I know what they are.
[294:28.95]I'm not even going to pick them up.
[294:33.90]Monster manual.
[294:47.05]Alright, time for a game over here.
[294:58.19]Blue baby!
[295:11.53]Alright, take yourself down to one heart, or like... Or don't.
[295:15.57]Take it down to one heart.
[295:19.93]I can't even.
[295:20.51]The flies are gonna kill me.
[295:27.52]Hooray!
[295:30.42]Infinite carry.
[295:34.39]Yay!
[295:35.13]I get to finish another run.
[295:45.53]That music... This cutscene, that's... God, you hate this game.
[295:55.60]What are you fucking on about?
[296:01.18]Store credits appear in the basement.
[296:02.32]I want to look at one more of the challenges.
[296:06.12]I did have a demo, man.
[296:09.45]What's this one?
[296:11.21]Seeing double... What's this one?
[296:18.09]So what's the... This is just... Wait, we both have it?
[296:25.22]Purist is fun.
[296:27.94]Um, isn't Purist where you... You don't get any items at all?
[296:42.97]Yeah, that's so difficult.
[296:44.05]It's just, I got no intention of doing that.
[296:49.27]Boiled baby.
[296:59.73]Just takes forever to kill bosses.
[297:05.01]Food clubs, alright.
[297:22.73]So no items, huh?
[297:26.39]Oh, there's another secret.
[297:29.95]Fuck, I thought I could kill them all before they touched me.
[297:33.69]Remember when he said it was going to be a maximum four hours Isaac stream?
[297:39.71]That's true, I did say that.
[297:42.01]But also remember, if you weren't here earlier, the stream's probably not going to be very much longer.
[297:49.40]I'm trying to take it easy.
[297:52.20]I've had some annoying pain.
[297:54.89]Those of you that know the yadda yadda yadda.
[297:59.51]I was kind of hurting the other day.
[298:04.55]And I'm kind of hurting now.
[298:06.99]But I took some Advil.
[298:08.25]And I'm like, okay now.
[298:09.71]But I can't sit here.
[298:13.42]I can't do like an eight hour session here.
[298:18.83]It really is the worst because, like, sitting down actually does make it worse after, like, five plus hours.
[298:26.60]What I'll probably have to end up doing is I'm probably gonna get a standing desk.
[298:34.87]And see if it helps.
[298:45.93]So, it's on the table.
[298:49.53]Tape yourself to the ceiling.
[298:51.30]What?
[298:51.48]Because I have noticed that... Lying down is alright.
[299:00.67]Like, I wake up in the morning and I'm kind of stiff.
[299:03.91]But... And, like, moving around.
[299:06.67]If I'm, like, walking around and moving around, I'm, like, usually... I'm, like, okay.
[299:11.84]It's not as bad as it is with just seated.
[299:14.36]Something about the seated position, even with a good posture and with a brace on, something about it, I don't know.
[299:20.42]It's like somehow it's compressing my spine and ribcage and making my issue already, it's there, worse.
[299:28.70]That is a credit card.
[299:32.16]Good thing you just used it for no reason.
[299:36.81]Oh, that's good.
[299:37.35]Luck up.
[299:39.86]Get a hanging fro- Get a hanging roller coaster chair.
[299:50.99]That would actually be pretty cool.
[299:54.39]But we're gonna fill this room with shit.
[300:00.45]Oops.
[300:00.63]I thought there were no item rooms.
[300:06.58]In the challenges.
[300:07.32]Wait, what?
[300:09.28]How is there an item room in here?
[300:10.26]Get a lumbar roller?
[300:13.82]I have one already.
[300:17.42]I'm doing physical therapy.
[300:19.34]I have.
[300:22.77]Trust me, if there's a device to help with, like, potential costochondritis, like, arthritis, I've probably used it or tried it.
[300:35.57]I've tried it.
[300:37.54]Some of them help.
[300:38.24]Some of them make it worse.
[300:48.38]Is that a tinted rock?
[300:49.32]Fuck, it's not.
[300:59.95]What about marijuana?
[301:02.93]It's true.
[301:05.27]Although...
[301:07.34]Here's the issue.
[301:07.94]Okay, I'm gonna give you guys the real talk time, okay?
[301:14.12]So, of course, something like marijuana.
[301:17.03]I mean, it's legal in Las Vegas.
[301:19.87]It's completely recreationally legal.
[301:21.51]Here's the problem.
[301:25.39]If I smoke weed, or if I do CBD, if I smoke weed...
[301:30.79]I... I can't stream.
[301:33.13]I can't, like, do anything.
[301:35.63]I just sit in, like, a room and just... I'm already so scatterbrained and so fucked up and so ADHD.
[301:45.73]No.
[301:47.01]I can't do anything.
[301:54.91]Like, imagine if I, like, smoked and then streamed.
[301:57.47]It'd be like... You don't want to watch that stream.
[302:02.69]And then, but there's also, like, just... Ooh, there we go.
[302:04.48]Got it.
[302:05.84]Finally.
[302:06.16]Um... Yeah, there's also just CBD oil, which you can just have... You can have no THC in it or anything, but yeah.
[302:18.22]I actually have done it before.
[302:19.94]I had a bottle.
[302:21.66]It was, like, little droplets I would put under my tongue.
[302:27.88]I have tried it before.
[302:44.65]Go to chiropractor.
[302:45.95]Well, um, the theory is I'm doing stuff, physical therapy first.
[302:52.08]So, once physical therapy is like, hey, this is gonna work or this is not gonna work, that's what we're doing first.
[303:04.44]Chiropractors are shit.
[303:10.05]Yeah!
[303:12.41]But part of me is also in that boat right now where... I mean, I gotta get like a clear, clear picture of exactly what's going on.
[303:24.16]And right now, it's like, okay, you might have this like osteochondritis, but now you might have rheumatoid arthritis.
[303:32.46]Rheumatoid?
[303:36.88]Apparently, I have a high rheumatoid factor.
[303:42.51]I did a blood test for it, and I don't know.
[303:44.65]We're gonna check it out, and we're gonna see.
[303:49.18]And, here's the thing.
[303:52.60]It's... I have autoimmune problems already.
[303:57.73]Like the colitis thing.
[304:00.57]That's autoimmune.
[304:03.98]RA is autoimmune.
[304:06.16]So the doctor was like, you know, it's not against the realm of all possibility that you could just have RA.
[304:13.48]I'm like, okay.
[304:23.10]But once there's a clear indicator of what is actually fucking going on,
[304:30.71]That's when, you know, if it's something, if I have fucking like arthritis, then whatever, I have arthritis and you take medicine for it.
[304:38.54]You manage it and you'll be, you're fine.
[304:40.42]You'll be alright.
[304:41.20]You might have good days, you might have bad days, but you, you know, you're still doing it.
[304:47.22]See, right now the problem is I'm not being really treated for anything.
[304:49.72]Like, we're like throwing darts.
[304:53.15]And none of those darts have really landed significantly in any area that is like, yeah, that's definitive.
[304:58.99]That's exactly what's going on.
[305:02.38]And while I talk to my friend on the telephone and just walk into every enemy.
[305:15.48]Fuck!
[305:18.72]Throwing spaghetti at the ceiling.
[305:27.84]You'll have problems getting into your clown car, but you can still stream.
[305:31.43]Yeah, I... I'm not... I'm not... I'm trying just to stay... It's really easy to get frustrated at something like this.
[305:42.67]When I have the camera on, you've probably seen me, like, lean back and, like, spread, and it's like... It's kind of why I'm doing that.
[305:52.92]Just do shrooms!
[305:54.52]Ha ha ha!
[305:56.90]I'm not so sure that's going to help me.
[306:02.28]Alright, we'll do one more.
[306:03.58]One more Psycho try as hard as I fucking can Azazel run.
[306:10.20]I want to do Greed Mode in Anti-Bird, but it doesn't exist.
[306:24.37]I would.
[306:28.46]That's not trying as hard as I can.
[306:29.57]That's getting hit by a spider.
[306:30.83]It's getting hit by a default spider.
[306:35.95]What happened to Bethany?
[306:37.61]Yeah.
[306:39.10]That's true.
[306:41.28]But I can't go wicked fast and try as hard as I fucking can.
[306:45.98]Mongo, baby.
[307:00.65]We got the kind of a kind of a shitty start not a pretty bad start it's a shitty start whatever
[307:20.17]Why do I say wicked?
[307:20.95]Because I'm from the East Coast, specifically Massachusetts.
[307:25.79]And it is part of every one of our... Every citizen that lives in Massachusetts is part of their vocabulary.
[307:30.91]I'm talking even like lawyers and doctors and shit.
[307:40.21]Well, you see, uh, judge.
[307:43.73]I'm sorry, but the plaintiff here has been wicked stupid with the way that he handled this case.
[307:49.33]Doesn't matter.
[307:55.27]Oh, boy, I'm getting hit.
[307:57.13]Wow, that had much... Oh, well, just reset.
[308:00.05]Shitty items.
[308:06.98]R?
[308:07.18]What the fuck?
[308:09.14]R. Okay.
[308:33.61]It was.
[308:34.25]Passage.
[308:35.07]Ooh.
[308:35.41]That's the one that makes the thing underneath you, right?
[308:37.01]I don't see any tinted rocks.
[308:44.25]Yes, I do.
[308:44.91]I'll have to come back.
[308:58.96]Holy water, splash.
[309:00.76]Aw, this thing sucks too.
[309:01.96]This thing really, you get hit and it just puts water on the ground, right?
[309:05.80]This thing's so bad.
[309:13.19]That's not a good first item.
[309:14.31]You gotta get something better than that.
[309:24.45]He's turning into a Randy.
[309:26.54]I want my last one to be at least sufficient.
[309:46.09]But yeah, we'll be stopping after this.
[309:49.91]Whatever that may be.
[309:53.45]Ammy's head.
[309:54.53]Ooh.
[309:56.22]That's a... Yup.
[309:57.72]That's a really good start.
[310:00.06]Like, phenomenal, actually.
[310:01.30]Let's see if I can do, like, the challenge mode, right?
[310:12.07]Don't you have to go... Is that an anti-berth?
[310:25.85]Yeah, boss rush.
[310:26.55]Maybe I'll try it.
[310:29.75]Friends till the end.
[310:30.41]Best friend.
[310:31.23]Okay, well.
[310:33.47]What the fuck did you just do to me?
[310:36.36]What did you just do to me?
[310:37.48]You're just supposed to be my best friend.
[310:38.84]You just threw a grenade at me.
[310:40.40]What?
[310:40.62]Sorry, we made it for it.
[310:54.42]No, reset.
[310:55.16]I don't have to reset.
[311:03.55]Come on.
[311:10.18]No, I need passive items.
[311:13.03]I mean, I'm gonna win.
[311:15.09]Like, it... You got Tammy's head with Azazel, you pretty much... There's a 95% chance of victory, no matter what.
[311:23.66]And I can go really fast.
[311:24.96]But, I have to get to the boss rush room.
[311:26.94]Maybe I shouldn't even do that.
[311:28.62]Just go for another victory.
[311:41.92]Look at this.
[311:42.38]This is just deleting time.
[311:45.91]You're the 5%.
[311:46.61]You just threw me off with that.
[311:52.57]Now that's what we're talking about.
[311:57.50]Halo, all stats up.
[312:00.62]And a room.
[312:03.36]What was that?
[312:03.96]Time is money?
[312:04.62]I don't want it.
[312:12.79]I need a key.
[312:19.73]Key, key, key, key!
[312:23.55]The bum?
[312:24.17]I don't need it.
[312:28.73]Devil, bum, dude, what the fuck?
[312:30.48]I don't need it.
[312:33.86]It's too, I, I wouldn't, it would kill me.
[312:36.96]I would, I would die, I would die from it.
[312:38.40]You know I would.
[312:41.91]You know I would kill me.
[312:42.63]I'm begging you.
[312:48.66]Well, it's closed now.
[312:49.48]I can't go back in there.
[313:01.37]Thank God there's a key.
[313:14.25]You can survive on non-red health, you fool.
[313:17.13]I didn't even go in the item room.
[313:25.35]PHD, better pills, that means it's guaranteed no matter what that the pills will not be bad.
[313:30.06]Range up is really good on a Zazel.
[313:32.86]As you see.
[313:45.73]Seed's gone.
[313:47.35]Fucked up.
[314:02.69]Boss rush.
[314:03.33]Let's go.
[314:03.75]I have no confidence in boss rush because I can only use Tammy's head once.
[314:17.32]Better pills.
[314:18.78]I can see forever!
[314:19.98]Good.
[314:24.00]New key.
[314:30.90]There's huge range on this too.
[314:32.24]Because of the thing I just got.
[314:34.94]That's good.
[314:39.38]Ah, the fucking TNT.
[314:44.42]Changes every boss wave?
[314:46.26]Really?
[314:48.63]I did not know that.
[315:00.86]Really?
[315:05.86]How fucking much range do those things have?
[315:25.05]do it okay we got need a key got the item room let's go what's your next game uh city's skylines city skylines is gonna be the next game that I'm gonna play oh dear which one
[315:56.92]What's the candle do?
[315:58.26]Not one spirit heart.
[316:00.43]Ugh.
[316:02.35]Hook them up, you cheater.
[316:03.31]I mean, I know what the shield does.
[316:12.83]Let's see.
[316:13.29]Candle.
[316:17.13]Candle.
[316:17.66]Hit.
[316:22.85]Past Gel Candle gives minus one tier delay for each room completed without taking damage up to a maximum of minus six.
[316:33.07]So as long as you don't get hit, you get tiers up every room.
[316:41.32]But that's not... I mean, I'd rather just not take damage sometimes.
[316:46.96]I'd rather just, like, not take damage sometimes.
[316:50.48]Let's go.
[316:55.36]Blow up the angel.
[316:56.38]Right.
[316:57.36]Right.
[316:57.60]That's ticky.
[316:58.02]Yeah.
[316:58.50]I didn't have any more bombs.
[317:02.24]Oh, we can open the door.
[317:02.86]Open the door.
[317:03.24]Open, open, open, open.
[317:03.94]Go, go, go, go, go.
[317:05.60]He sucks.
[317:07.36]Hey, come on.
[317:11.48]Feed and... That's what I wanted.
[317:12.70]Good.
[317:20.25]Find a bomb.
[317:27.25]Alright, just go down.
[317:34.10]One problem with Tammy's head with Azel is when you do that, the whole screen is gone.
[317:57.92]HP up.
[318:01.26]And I'll get it again, too.
[318:12.39]Bomb the door?
[318:13.03]No, I want to do some... This current save file does not have... None of these characters have beaten Satan and shit in this save file.
[318:28.98]I don't want to do it.
[318:37.31]I can't afford that.
[318:38.55]If I am going to try boss rush, I might as well go for it, right?
[318:55.48]What is this?
[318:57.14]Maestosis?
[318:57.60]Maestosis?
[319:02.22]I can't believe they're gonna put this.
[319:03.20]It's a different seed completely.
[319:04.48]What does this do?
[319:30.73]Holy water doesn't up your holy stat.
[319:33.07]Yeah, that's right.
[319:36.54]That's true.
[319:37.04]That's absolutely right.
[319:38.80]It should.
[319:41.50]I'm not picking that up.
[319:42.66]I know what this thing does.
[319:44.58]This is actually the worst item in the whole game.
[319:48.21]By far.
[319:49.55]That's the one where if you take damage, it teleports you out of the room.
[319:54.75]That thing sucks.
[319:59.82]item isn't it called item martyr that's not what this does you're thinking of it's involved in a bunch of game breaking combos oh
[320:37.00]Gives you a spacebar item charge.
[320:40.68]Ah, right.
[320:41.42]Okay.
[320:45.57]Speaking with such certainty.
[320:47.87]And knows nothing of what he speaks.
[321:05.62]You can't get me over here or you can't walk in the air like I can.
[321:08.12]Because I'm Azazel.
[321:09.54]I don't know what you're tipping, but I'm fucking mad about it.
[321:37.27]Spirit of the Night.
[321:38.29]Scary.
[321:42.89]What is that?
[321:44.99]Hey chat, what's that do?
[321:53.92]It's useless?
[321:54.84]Oh.
[321:54.92]What the fuck?
[322:09.40]You can double fly now.
[322:10.98]Cool.
[322:11.28]Get four wings.
[322:16.75]Fuck, every time I can't see.
[322:17.87]I'm trying to go too fast.
[322:25.26]That's the issue.
[322:25.84]I'm trying to speed, speed, speed.
[322:30.72]Tammy said, Tammy said, Tammy said, Tammy said.
[322:32.16]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[322:34.32]Like that.
[322:39.00]Unk!
[322:39.68]Turn a light.
[322:42.76]He's really gonna lose with Tammy's head on Azazel, huh?
[322:46.27]No, he's not.
[322:46.89]He's not.
[322:47.55]He will complete at least one portion of this game.
[323:01.70]Azazel!
[323:05.86]Who you playing on, dude?
[323:12.25]I'm saying it the way that I say it.
[323:13.39]Which is wrong.
[323:24.14]But it's Jupiter, though.
[323:30.38]You guys know that's not the correct way to say it.
[323:32.02]You still say it that way, don't you?
[323:37.30]call the fuck out call the fuck out call the fuck up call the fuck up
[324:06.27]What the fuck?
[324:06.89]Got one.
[324:09.45]Let's go.
[324:17.64]Ah!
[324:24.36]Shot speed and damage up.
[324:25.44]I don't know what it is.
[324:28.87]I don't want it.
[324:37.26]Did you just fight a boss?
[324:38.22]Yes.
[324:40.31]Why does this room keep filling with hearts?
[324:54.61]It's the trinket.
[324:56.17]Oh.
[324:59.51]Alright, well I got a lot of money.
[325:10.28]That spawns all the items left on the previous floor.
[325:12.71]That's really, really cool.
[325:13.85]That's really interesting.
[325:30.30]Should have got Dark Bum.
[325:34.18]Yep.
[325:35.62]I really should have.
[325:44.30]I was just too scared.
[325:46.21]Bombs are key.
[325:49.11]They are now.
[325:57.36]What the fuck does it mean?
[325:58.76]Oh, if they spluttle, I'll blumb.
[326:03.22]Slow effect.
[326:30.02]Awww.
[326:33.34]Cool.
[326:37.53]Dude, it's a mega milk bean.
[326:40.79]You guys are fucking crazy.
[326:58.36]Kinda sucks.
[327:02.66]What do you got, mom?
[327:06.60]Okay.
[327:07.95]I can bomb.
[327:09.53]Use a bomb.
[327:10.65]Polaroid.
[327:14.13]Polaroid.
[327:15.73]Bomb.
[327:17.33]Or boss rush.
[327:19.97]Boss rush.
[327:20.77]Or Polaroid.
[327:21.63]And go bomb.
[327:24.03]Polaroid.
[327:24.83]Boss rush.
[327:26.13]Let's go.
[327:29.98]Which one is the best?
[327:35.30]Wait.
[327:37.36]Oh.
[327:39.42]I can still get there.
[327:39.98]I can still do it.
[327:50.82]Wafer, yep.
[327:58.58]Alright, so what one of these is any good?
[328:01.89]These kind of all suck, huh?
[328:11.10]Plug?
[328:11.90]Is the plug any good?
[328:12.60]120 volts up.
[328:32.92]Why is my thing not charged?
[328:46.52]I didn't get lied to, did I?
[328:47.40]Oh, well.
[328:50.31]There it is.
[328:50.67]I just have to get hit.
[328:52.37]I got pranked.
[328:56.13]Sorry.
[328:56.45]I only use it when I need to.
[329:04.74]I hate this motherfucker.
[329:05.51]Get rid of him.
[329:05.97]I don't like that guy.
[329:06.51]That guy sucks.
[329:27.15]I wish it wasn't so dark.
[329:33.97]Fuck, sorry
[330:30.40]There's a lot of people.
[330:41.56]Who?
[330:42.06]Oh, he's dead.
[330:50.26]How am I not getting hit by that shit?
[330:51.96]You gotta be kidding me.
[330:52.66]That was lucky as hell.
[331:25.02]Watch out for these fucking guys.
[331:30.17]What the hell?
[331:32.03]Oh.
[331:38.57]Top's slowing me down.
[331:39.31]No!
[331:40.45]That's the worst combo to have right now.
[331:42.73]But he's dead.
[331:44.57]That's fine.
[331:46.35]Where is he?
[332:04.67]I did it!
[332:04.97]You know what?
[332:14.21]That was pretty cool.
[332:19.28]Oh my god, don't fucking die.
[332:20.56]Alright, that was fun.
[332:25.06]Bomb the angel.
[332:25.66]I can't.
[332:35.40]Well, I'll take some of these.
[332:36.33]It's alright.
[332:44.62]I have a couple of opportunities, don't I?
[333:01.35]Buy all caps because zero brain cells.
[333:03.41]What are you doing?
[333:09.17]Let's go.
[333:14.39]Damage and health.
[333:15.19]Good.
[333:15.47]Okay.
[333:18.27]No room though.
[333:19.39]Oh well.
[333:25.68]Like I need more damage right now.
[333:30.83]Two hearts.
[333:32.41]Two hearts is better.
[333:41.26]That one felt good, I will say.
[333:43.37]That one felt very good.
[333:44.33]It was very satisfying to do.
[333:59.36]The lightning arcs, too?
[334:01.32]That's awesome.
[334:03.56]Are there people?
[334:07.82]You know what?
[334:08.18]I hear... You ever play Binding of Isaac?
[334:10.62]How many of you here?
[334:11.98]You ever get an item build that you wish that there was, like, ten more stages to the game so you could keep playing with it?
[334:18.29]Damn it.
[334:25.75]I got cocky.
[334:30.01]That's what victory lap is for.
[334:31.52]Yeah, yeah, I know.
[334:32.94]But still.
[334:33.32]I missed a rock.
[334:39.16]How do you even see that from there?
[334:43.12]How would you even see me missing a rock?
[334:44.94]Holy shit, your eyes.
[334:46.08]20-20 vision.
[334:51.09]Wait, there's another one.
[335:10.90]Is it Jubeid?
[335:12.72]Right next to the door?
[335:17.09]Oh, the boss door.
[335:24.07]In here?
[335:26.29]I don't even... Really?
[335:30.32]Damn it.
[335:30.86]Sorry.
[335:35.70]Damn it.
[335:36.04]It's alright.
[335:44.38]Here we go!
[335:45.04]Opportunity, right?
[335:45.88]Can I still do it?
[335:46.54]Damage and HP up.
[335:52.28]I don't have enough?
[335:55.64]Is it still time?
[336:04.37]No?
[336:05.89]You get a Joker?
[336:06.97]Oh.
[336:09.25]Well, shit.
[336:17.76]There's a chance.
[336:18.84]There is a chance.
[336:23.79]There's just a chance.
[336:24.65]That's all I need to hear.
[336:25.33]This shit does so much damage.
[336:34.38]It's unbelievable how much damage Tammy's head does with Brimstone.
[336:38.20]It's just not even fair.
[336:57.49]Oh, we're right here already!
[336:59.17]Speed!
[337:00.63]The speed!
[337:05.20]Zero percent chance?
[337:06.02]Should we just go in or explore in case we get a Joker?
[337:26.30]Oh, I didn't get them all.
[337:30.96]Joker or Sacrifice Room.
[337:42.55]Even if you get the Joker, it might take you to the Devil Room.
[337:44.47]Yeah, worth a shot.
[337:58.70]The game's just playing itself at this point.
[338:11.31]The lovers!
[338:12.55]Oh, look.
[338:15.37]Telepills!
[338:20.21]Oh!
[338:21.09]No, I thought that was the temple from shit!
[338:26.26]Let's just do it for fun.
[338:45.75]For a second I thought we had it, but then I was like, nah, it doesn't matter because it's not the Angel Room.
[338:54.17]So I guess I just didn't remember from a while ago when I played Binding of Isaac.
[338:58.52]So after the boss rush, the game doesn't end.
[339:00.18]Sorry, I did not know that.
[339:02.86]I thought the game was, I thought the game ended.
[339:15.24]cards joker joker joker joker joker mom's bottle of pills tele pills yes here we go
[339:43.62]Keep trying.
[339:44.18]Oh, I'm gonna keep trying.
[340:07.63]Oh, you're still alive.
[340:12.66]Well, that's pretty much done deal.
[340:18.00]Unless I can find a battery.
[340:32.99]Try for super secret rooms.
[340:36.59]Where are some possibilities?
[340:37.57]Up here, right?
[340:38.97]It's only connected to one room, right?
[340:41.05]So it could be like right here.
[340:50.49]All the way to the left.
[340:53.87]One near the boss.
[341:01.23]This one here.
[341:07.94]Could be.
[341:11.66]Same room, but the left wall.
[341:14.78]It's within two rooms from the boss.
[341:24.84]It could be the one on the left, right?
[341:28.61]Or the north wall above the boss wall.
[341:30.59]I only have two tries anyways.
[341:35.39]Top or right of boss.
[341:43.83]It could not be up here or over here.
[341:46.60]East wall, like over here.
[341:51.06]Either one.
[341:51.44]We'll try this one.
[341:57.33]No.
[342:32.69]Dad's key.
[342:33.58]Dad's key in chest.
[342:34.91]Dad's key!
[343:00.67]You're gonna be so upset if it's actually an angel room here.
[343:03.68]Oh, I'm gonna be so sad.
[343:09.20]No angel room.
[343:10.20]No angel room.
[343:10.90]Don't worry.
[343:11.50]It was all for nothing.
[343:12.26]Don't worry.
[343:18.06]Alright.
[343:20.10]Dad's key.
[343:22.83]That's not it.
[343:23.81]That's not it.
[343:24.97]That's not it.
[343:26.23]That's not it.
[343:29.29]Give me the lemonade.
[343:34.94]Poison tears.
[343:37.72]Triple shot.
[343:38.72]Holy fuck.
[343:44.39]What is this thing?
[343:46.41]Undefined.
[343:55.84]What?
[343:56.02]I don't have Tammy's head anymore.
[344:11.74]Wait!
[344:12.08]Will this give me Tammy's head?
[344:13.28]The forget-me-not?
[344:15.00]Alright, I'm going in.
[344:31.71]Recharge with the fly.
[344:46.78]Alright, but what?
[344:53.63]What am I doing?
[344:54.29]To leave?
[344:56.43]Use it now.
[344:56.97]Ah, that didn't do anything!
[345:04.19]What?
[345:21.66]Wait, what just happened?
[345:41.85]Bob's brain.
[345:42.99]Pog.
[345:44.87]Oh, no, I don't have Tammy's head.
[345:46.99]It doesn't matter.
[345:47.59]This shot, this quadruple shot is fucking crazy.
[345:56.75]Look at that shit.
[345:58.79]Find the timeline that opens the door.
[346:01.65]Just loop it.
[346:03.41]Loop again.
[346:04.54]Until you get Dad's key.
[346:05.92]Okay.
[346:17.19]We'll try it.
[346:33.36]Alright, here we go.
[346:37.74]Yeah, I also- I need keys too, though.
[346:39.31]That's the thing.
[346:47.35]Super Greed?
[346:49.61]No!
[346:50.47]That's not who I wanted to see.
[347:02.96]No, I don't want this.
[347:16.90]Daddy's love.
[347:18.38]Oh, too bad.
[347:36.08]I kill him if I touch him.
[347:49.74]Well, I... This is throwing?
[347:53.90]What do you mean?
[347:55.70]Dad's key is not in the item pool.
[347:59.06]Uh-oh.
[348:06.82]Well that's unfortunate.
[348:08.23]Yes it is.
[348:09.13]What do you mean?
[348:10.93]It is.
[348:12.98]Well which one is it?
[348:51.36]Watch out.
[348:53.82]Alright, here we go.
[348:58.50]Why am I taking so much damage?
[348:59.78]Because I'm trying to teleport around.
[349:01.70]I'm trying to teleport to the fucking... I'm taking damage.
[349:06.20]This heart's all in the chest room.
[349:09.38]Taking damage charges it, because of the thing I have.
[349:13.13]I'm not just walking into enemies, but I'm drunk.
[349:21.25]Alright, that's good.
[349:30.60]Don't pick that up yet, right?
[349:31.52]I'll pick it up.
[349:31.96]Whatever.
[349:32.20]Who cares?
[349:32.54]Whoops.
[349:39.57]Turn it up.
[349:40.11]It doesn't...
[349:46.67]Alright, well we're here.
[349:47.59]I got like one more chance for this.
[349:51.51]Kill this stuff in this room.
[349:57.91]Here we go!
[349:59.89]Wait, there's... WAIT!
[350:05.87]No, I need these keys!
[350:07.43]I need the keys!
[350:09.17]Holy shit, what is all this?
[350:37.76]No, I don't wanna.
[350:39.48]What is this thing?
[350:41.64]That's doctor feet.
[350:42.56]I don't want that, right?
[350:55.29]How many items can you have in the game?
[351:10.69]Okay, I need to heal.
[351:11.81]I can't just die.
[351:39.16]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[351:44.30]Wait, this is gonna explode if I hit anyone!
[351:46.84]It's all up to Bob's brain!
[351:51.55]Get me out!
[351:52.01]Get me out!
[351:54.41]I have to kill people with Bob's brain or I'm dead!
[351:58.65]Right?
[351:59.13]Am I good?
[352:00.29]Okay.
[352:02.69]Okay, I gotta stop fucking around.
[352:04.29]I gotta go back.
[352:05.03]I gotta go right.
[352:05.85]I gotta get the hell out of here.
[352:13.29]I need health.
[352:15.14]Oh my fuck.
[352:16.70]Okay.
[352:17.80]I gotta go.
[352:19.52]Down?
[352:20.38]Down here.
[352:20.68]I need these hearts.
[352:34.17]How the hell did I get over there?
[352:46.27]Oh fucking my god.
[352:47.65]Oh my god.
[352:48.65]Oh my god.
[352:50.23]How do I get back down?
[353:20.23]Okay, only have to do two more rooms.
[353:21.81]Okay.
[353:25.23]98 coins.
[353:51.33]Take Dr. Fetus.
[353:52.45]I'm not- I know what he does.
[353:53.47]Charging with damage is a last resort.
[354:00.07]Empty the chest pool!
[354:01.23]Holy shit!
[354:07.90]What the fuck?!
[354:10.58]What the fuck is going on?!
[354:13.28]Oh no!
[354:14.80]Empty the chest pool!
[354:16.95]I wanted that- okay, I emptied the chest pool!
[354:23.87]I'm gonna do this one last chance.
[354:32.68]Oh, I gotta go fucking kill the boss now.
[354:42.70]Timelines are split.
[354:43.60]What do you mean no?
[354:50.64]What the hell are you talking about?
[355:06.99]In terms of building it up on my own, loop until you faint.
[355:11.09]You can take more damage.
[355:13.04]You guys are fucking nuts.
[355:15.24]You guys are fucking nuts.
[355:17.95]But I like it.
[355:42.70]Just look at how much damage this shit does.
[355:45.04]It's kind of like better.
[355:49.52]It's a little bit better than what I just had, except it goes all over the place and hurts you.
[355:58.77]Nope.
[356:08.36]He's got a raid?
[356:09.16]Joel just came in with a raid?
[356:10.39]What's going on guys?
[356:13.58]We are currently doing, uh... Okay, this is the room.
[356:17.39]It's half a heart.
[356:18.99]Uh, we're doing... We're doing a finding of Isaac.
[356:21.85]And I fucked up big time.
[356:23.77]I need to find... I need to get Dad's Key.
[356:26.41]Which spawns inside of one of these chests sometimes.
[356:30.16]Uh, so we're redoing in a time loop over and over again this level.
[356:33.30]Because I have a... I have a thing that can make it so we can potentially do that.
[356:37.52]So that's what we're doing.
[356:39.06]It's really, really ridiculous and super fucking crazy...
[356:46.59]I want that heart before I do anything.
[356:50.41]But thanks a lot for the raid.
[356:51.27]Welcome, guys.
[356:52.19]I don't know what you guys are doing, but hopefully it was fun.
[356:56.42]Come on.
[356:57.74]Yes!
[356:58.48]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[357:00.26]Let's do this tactically.
[357:02.66]I just killed him.
[357:09.41]We do it again.
[357:28.36]Look at how many people are behind me.
[357:32.44]This is not even Binding of Isaac anymore.
[357:34.52]This is just like what it's like to go to the DMV.
[357:39.66]It's like a Disney World line.
[357:41.56]Okay, how much... We got... I gotta get it.
[357:50.13]I gotta get it.
[357:51.19]I gotta... How many items are in Binding of Isaac?
[357:59.67]I gotta do it by fighting.
[358:03.66]Because I can't take any more damage.
[358:05.22]We lost all the hearts.
[358:08.10]I have to clear rooms and go from there.
[358:17.67]Just half the heart?
[358:18.29]I'll get it.
[358:18.67]This is so fucking stupid.
[358:29.18]You have a second life.
[358:30.20]Yeah, I don't want to waste it.
[358:31.18]No.
[358:48.98]No, I'm going to be here forever.
[358:51.31]I'm never going to fucking leave.
[358:53.47]I'll never leave.
[358:54.37]I can do this forever.
[358:58.82]Um, alright.
[359:02.24]How many more spaces are there?
[359:12.91]Jesus Christ.
[359:14.83]How many of those am I gonna get?
[359:15.95]I'm gonna get full hearts.
[359:38.02]Ninety... Is there like a giant key that's 99 keys?
[359:43.45]Here we go.
[359:43.83]Nope.
[360:11.24]God damn it.
[360:14.68]What is this?
[360:15.40]A magic room.
[360:20.50]Toxic aura tears.
[360:24.25]I can't even hurt myself with my own bombs anymore?
[360:38.24]I can just spam.
[360:39.60]I'm unkillable with my own bombs.
[360:46.57]This is fucked up.
[360:52.01]When I take damage, it kills the whole room.
[360:57.05]Yes!
[360:58.01]Okay, what does this stuff do?
[361:01.01]Sweet suffering and damage up and range up.
[361:04.64]Controlled tears?
[361:06.66]What?
[361:11.99]Okay!
[361:30.04]More eyes!
[361:34.02]Hold on a second.
[361:34.90]You gotta be shitting me.
[361:37.69]Wait, I thought I...
[361:40.20]I can't- I'm supposed to be able to detonate these on my own!
[361:42.22]Okay.
[361:49.07]Let's go.
[362:04.64]I need those keys though.
[362:06.18]I'm gonna run out of keys.
[362:23.30]I can't fucking believe this shit.

[363:00.98]Fuck.

[363:19.33]Whenever I take damage.

[370:53.04]Where do I see my items?
[370:54.72]It won't even show them to me.
[371:05.41]No, nothing.

[372:01.33]Jesus.
[372:05.12]Dude, I can't even pick this up.
[372:06.12]There's too many people around it.
[372:08.98]Shot speed up again.
[372:11.16]And... Just leave me alone.
[372:17.23]I can't even pick it up.
[372:21.03]I'm full heart.
[372:22.73]I only have seven keys left, though.
[372:23.91]This is bad.
[372:42.40]Brother Bobby.
[372:44.32]All stats up, then shuffled.
[372:45.74]I can't... The screen is more of people.
[372:52.55]Farm for keys now.
[372:53.77]Okay, that's a good idea.
[372:55.79]Just farm for keys.
[372:57.84]I can always teleport.
[372:59.96]This is key farming only.
[373:01.28]Okay.
[373:12.59]Keys.
[373:13.47]Bingo.
[373:14.36]Five.
[373:28.68]I'm hacking.
[373:29.26]This is what it's like to hack this when you hack in the game.
[373:33.42]More keys.
[373:33.76]Good.
[373:36.04]This is... I downloaded a trainer.
[373:40.23]And this is what the outcome was.
[373:41.64]I put every item on in the whole game.
[373:47.36]What is... You feel balanced.
[374:07.32]I don't even know who's in that room.
[374:14.70]Very balanced.
[374:15.06]Very balanced.
[374:25.87]I need more keys.
[374:28.39]By the way, when I get to Mega Satan, you do realize I'm just gonna hold this button down and it's gonna happen eventually.
[374:33.73]I don't care if this takes another six hours.
[374:36.19]I'm doing this shit.
[374:37.05]I'm getting Dad's key and I'm opening that fucking door.
[374:46.36]No keys.
[374:48.76]Look at all these hearts, too.
[374:53.96]Alright, keys.
[374:56.15]I just got a quarter.
[374:59.29]Alright, it's time to go.
[375:04.06]Was that a god item?

[376:47.04]What's happening right now?
[376:50.72]Why am I surrounded by these shits?
[376:52.92]What is happening?

[385:15.77]Okay.
[385:18.19]Go.
[385:20.65]The game's gonna crash.

[386:20.70]Holy shit.

[386:33.32]Should I exit just in case?
[386:35.50]Exit and come back?
[386:37.12]Just in case something horrible happens?
[386:40.24]No?
[386:41.04]No.
[386:42.00]What if it fucks up?
[386:42.98]Okay, no.
[386:43.58]What if it fucks up?
[386:44.10]You're right.
[386:49.48]Did I get a key?
[386:50.02]Was that a key?
[387:07.13]Okay, no key.
[387:10.80]What is this?
[387:15.26]Multi-colored tears!
[387:18.20]It's a fucking goddamn Skittles party in here!
[387:22.97]Oh shit!
[387:23.69]I gotta get out of here!
[387:24.79]I gotta get out, I gotta crash the game!
[387:32.91]Okay, alright, slow down, slow down, slow down, I need... How have I not gotten any keys?
[387:38.40]Alright, minions, kill them.
[387:41.90]Shit, running out of keys.
[387:48.62]Gimme a key.
[387:57.01]Do you have dad's key unlocked?
[388:11.53]I have to?
[388:14.53]Why wouldn't I?
[388:15.17]You have to unlock it?
[388:21.40]Wait.
[388:24.57]I got it?
[388:25.94]I do have it?
[388:27.10]I have it.
[388:27.62]Okay.
[388:34.64]Judgment.
[388:35.00]Wait.
[388:35.38]We might be able to get a few keys out of this.
[388:40.37]Excuse me.
[388:40.71]I don't know.
[388:50.39]Somebody picked it up.
[388:51.05]Wouldn't me.
[388:52.37]Somebody pocketed it.
[388:53.13]Well, it just came out.
[388:56.57]Yep, good.
[388:57.67]Yes!
[388:57.93]I'm looking for keys.
[389:04.92]Can everybody get away from me for a second?
[389:16.46]Can you get keys out of this?
[389:27.05]I don't want to take that.
[389:33.47]Get rid of this.
[389:45.08]And I have spiders now.
[389:47.94]I'm playing a game of snake.
[389:53.65]But, like, a toddler set it up, and they colored outside the lines.
[389:58.13]I heard a key.
[390:04.68]Where is it?
[390:05.82]Got it.
[390:10.24]Oh!
[390:10.38]Oh!
[390:11.38]Oh!
[390:11.66]Oh!
[390:11.92]Oh!
[390:12.16]Oh!
[390:12.56]Oh!
[390:23.05]Stream ain't fucking ever turning off now, boys and girls.
[390:26.75]We are never stopping.
[390:28.77]It's never gonna turn the fuck off.
[390:32.01]We have... We can get every item in the entire fucking video game if we have to.
[390:36.49]In the... 200 fucking items?
[390:39.80]Whatever.
[390:40.14]200?
[390:40.16]300 items?
[390:43.82]Game's gonna break eventually, but you know what?
[390:45.58]Fuck it.
[390:49.70]Okay.
[390:49.90]Let's go.
[390:54.09]Godspeed, everybody.
[391:04.18]Poop.
[391:05.18]Poop on the ground over here.
[391:07.04]Blast damage?
[391:08.01]Holy shit.
[391:12.47]Oh my fucking god.
[391:13.67]Damage reduction.
[391:14.45]Toxic blood.
[391:16.17]And... And evil.
[391:19.25]And I'm evil!
[391:24.91]We gotta go.
[391:25.37]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[391:39.63]Got it.
[391:48.95]He became Lord of the Flies.
[391:50.49]Ice cream scoop?
[391:55.53]There it is.
[391:55.95]Hooray.
[391:59.59]Now, I have a question.
[392:03.17]If I do not pick that up, can I do this 900 more times and get it again?
[392:12.95]What if I... No.
[392:18.14]I have to pick it up.
[392:22.06]It won't show up again.
[392:24.87]Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it's over.
[392:27.09]It's over.
[392:42.68]Do the whole floor first.
[392:49.04]Seed.
[392:50.40]Write that down.
[392:51.40]If you'd like to do this.
[393:00.74]How long do you think it's going to take me to kill Mega Sager?
[393:03.46]Let's put it this way.
[393:05.00]I'm going to hold down... Just use it now.
[393:12.37]I'm going to hold down an attack button and stand still.
[393:16.55]You guys ready?
[393:25.37]I am.
[393:28.12]Three, two, one.
[393:32.14]Get item.
[393:34.72]Okay.
[393:44.22]There you go, Satan.
[393:49.11]It's time for your-
[393:57.63]I'm gonna die!
[394:02.03]I'm gonna die!
[394:02.87]I'm not even... I'm not even hurting him!
[394:07.31]I don't think I'm even hurting him.
[394:19.98]It's just...
[394:29.71]I didn't think I was even attacking him he had this look on his face like holy shit man I'm not gonna go near that he was just watching like a whole city burn
[395:02.23]That was fucking crazy.
[395:14.36]I can't believe that actually happened.
[395:15.94]That actually worked.
[395:18.24]Damn, that was fucking crazy.
[395:19.60]That was cool.
[395:20.68]I'm just speechless the whole time.
[395:23.06]I don't even know what the hell to say.
[395:24.92]That was outrageous.
[395:35.64]And that's the one you go out on.
[395:40.70]Like... I can't... I don't think I can play this game again like this.
[395:50.53]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[395:54.63]It's... I feel like I'm in slow motion right now.
[395:57.79]That's gonna be it.
[396:06.21]That was supposed to be the last one anyways, so.
[396:11.87]Anywho, thanks for watching.
[396:13.95]I'll see you again later this week.
[396:16.03]I will be off for the next three days.
[396:19.32]So you'll see me again on Friday.
[396:21.52]Friday the 20th.
[396:23.20]We'll do probably Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[396:30.99]We are going to start Cities Skylines...
[396:35.04]On Friday.
[396:36.26]That's the plan.
[396:40.12]A bunch of people have given subs.
[396:42.20]A ton of money came in today, too.
[396:45.62]We'll make sure to go over it all.
[396:46.74]But 25 community subs from Morkus Borkus.
[396:49.00]Thanks for the subs.
[396:51.84]And a wild marrow thanks to 10 community subs.
[396:54.77]Huge sub drops right at the end.
[396:56.05]Thanks, both of you.
[396:57.93]That was quite the crack stream, it was.
[397:03.74]But I'll see you guys on Friday.
[397:07.32]We'll stick around for a little bit longer, like 30-40 minutes.
[397:09.04]We'll do the bits and hang out for a little bit.
[397:11.84]But see you guys on Friday.
[397:14.08]Have a wonderful night.
[397:15.44]Take care of yourselves.
[397:16.70]Good night.
[397:19.58]Just move to the end.
[397:22.36]Ow!
[397:25.74]I gotta like put this microphone... I gotta hang this microphone from the ceiling.
[397:30.50]Seriously, like I gotta hang this thing from the fucking ceiling.
[397:36.79]I just like almost broke my fingers.
[397:40.93]But let's do this.
[397:44.59]Back to earlier today.
[397:48.74]Like a boxing announcer.
[397:50.10]Exactly.
[397:52.26]You get it.
[397:56.06]Music on.
[398:02.00]And we're going to go back to earlier this afternoon.
[398:06.26]To, uh... LM, man, thanks for the 10 bucks thousand bits.
[398:11.20]That sucks.
[398:11.50]That's really not cool.
[398:12.00]I mean...
[398:38.72]None of that matters.
[398:42.22]Remember, if somebody around here has it, regardless of their race or gender, it doesn't matter.
[398:50.37]If you don't practice the necessary hygiene and you don't do the necessary things, you're the one that has spread it.
[398:57.11]And a lot of people don't even know they have it.
[399:00.23]Right?
[399:01.25]You're asymptomatic for like a week or two, aren't you?
[399:08.92]so it's like you can't be you can't be especially not going after because oh it originated in in China well so what it's here
[399:34.59]Now we've got to take the precautions to try to not have it spread around anywhere else in the world.
[399:41.13]It's all over the world now.
[399:42.26]It's the whole world.
[399:49.64]It doesn't matter what somebody looks like.
[399:51.60]We're talking about a global pandemic.
[399:53.22]It's not about where they're from.
[399:54.62]We're talking about a global scale.
[400:01.97]But, regardless, I'm really sorry to hear you going through that bullshit.
[400:06.53]And hopefully, all this blows over really soon, because I know that we're inching closer and closer to... Now, in the United States, people's cities are kind of starting to go, well, we probably need to start locking down shit, and nobody can really be out.
[400:22.08]And who knows what'll happen in the next five to ten days.
[400:29.49]But thanks for the thousand bits and sorry to hear about that bullshit.
[400:35.99]StixRenegade, thanks for the 250.
[400:38.27]As a streamer, it's your duty to stream a thousand percent more during this time of pandemic.
[400:42.35]Many of us are now out of work or had our hours cut and are bored at work without you.
[400:47.44]Please.
[400:51.60]I'm here.
[400:56.44]The please at the end just...
[400:59.41]Oh my god.
[401:03.98]For real though, thanks for the $2.50, will the city skyline stream be modded at least so you have custom buildings and vehicles?
[401:10.18]Probably not initially because I've never played it before.
[401:12.68]So I'd like to figure out how the game works before I do any of that.
[401:18.28]So initially I'm just probably going to play the game the way it's intended to be played the first day maybe.
[401:23.41]Depending on what it does.
[401:27.69]Yeah.
[401:29.06]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $2.50.
[401:30.54]Hi, Jerm, I want to thank you for these streams, especially for The Binding of Isaac content.
[401:33.41]You're one of the only three things that made me forget for a while about the lockdown ever since it started here in Italy.
[401:40.73]I wanted to celebrate my two-year sub by getting the Glue Man shirt, but I'll have to wait for the lockdown to be lifted, because I'm afraid the package could get stuck somewhere because of it.
[401:48.76]Can you plan on making any more shirts in the future?
[401:54.53]Uh, not immediately.
[401:57.27]Nothing in the immediate future.
[402:01.07]But I do have plans of things I'd like to do.
[402:07.02]But none of them are really at the tip of the tongue right now.
[402:12.04]They're all in the back of the mouth.
[402:16.00]Someone will figure out what the fuck that meant.
[402:19.04]I don't know.
[402:21.29]But yeah, at some point in the future, I do want to add, because that Teespring store is just there permanently.
[402:25.44]So I'm just going to, the idea is just add shit to that store as, you know, the years go by and they just are there forever.
[402:37.26]I'd like to put maybe a couple a year, one or two a year, maybe something like that.
[402:41.95]There you go.
[402:46.00]No, it happens in my head.
[402:46.94]I mean, the answer is yes, but I do it upstairs.
[402:48.73]I don't really do it out loud.
[402:50.63]It depends on what the game is.
[402:52.97]Hey.
[403:14.94]I know, that's what I'm saying.
[403:17.48]That's what I mean.
[403:21.04]I don't give him the silent treatment unlike the rest of these clowns LOL.
[403:23.64]What a weird night.
[403:44.28]This was a weird one.
[403:45.42]This was a wild one.
[403:49.86]Uh, thanks for the dot dot dots.
[403:51.02]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[403:53.53]Abomination zero, thanks for the 250.
[403:54.77]I'm gonna tell Kim you're neglecting us.
[403:56.45]Um... Fucking do that, man.
[404:03.80]Hey, don't do that.
[404:06.42]Inferno, thanks for the thousand bits.
[404:08.68]$10.
[404:08.70]Jerma, you didn't have to listen to these babies.
[404:10.91]There's some people that are fighting here.
[404:19.13]Hey, SarenFP, thanks for the $2.50.
[404:20.85]Jerma, you remind me of when I was younger.
[404:22.79]Star Fox Adventures was one of my favorite games as a child, and I disliked Zelda, even though I hadn't played Ocarina or Wind Waker.
[404:31.30]You need not have bitterness in your heart just because you didn't play the better game.
[404:38.87]I played Ocarina of Time.
[404:41.68]I loved Ocarina of Time.
[404:43.54]I love that game.
[404:44.86]I love Ocarina of Time.
[404:46.46]What's the one for Super Nintendo?

[406:04.66]Mitchell gave you guys the wink dink.
[406:08.97]The Wink Dinks.
[406:10.07]That was Mitchell256.
[406:11.04]Forever will be infamous for creating the Wink Dink, uh, moniker.
[406:19.20]Uh, AfterSmith, thanks for the five dollars.
[406:21.20]Hey, GermyBoy.
[406:22.04]Haven't caught a stream in a while, but I did today after watching one of the second Germovids on a whim.
[406:27.61]Glad to see nothing's changed.
[406:29.91]Remember to remind chat to wipe.
[406:37.09]And then here's a meme.
[406:38.89]My friend playing Mario Galaxy and me collecting all the Star Bits as player two.
[406:47.72]Why do these people have Pringles taped to them?
[406:57.62]Nice Reddit link.
[407:00.26]I'm gonna fucking time that person out.
[407:01.98]I can't.
[407:02.70]I can't even do that.
[407:03.28]Streamlabs.
[407:04.48]OBS is a dumb program.
[407:07.40]anyways uh goiki thanks for the five dollars let's see what we let's see we got the drew crew the moo crew the shroom crew the wink dinks did I miss anybody I don't think so I think that's all of them what is this community the warriors
[407:41.80]Like, how many different, like, fighting groups of people do we have?
[407:52.53]Anyways.
[407:56.50]Come out to play!
[407:58.96]That's hard to do.
[408:00.26]I have to scream it, and I'm not going to.
[408:01.58]Uh, Green Day and Cats, thanks for the five dollars.
[408:09.30]I'm glad to see you're still streaming despite not feeling the best.
[408:11.56]I've been watching the VODs forever now and finally was able to catch them live.
[408:16.42]In regards to your mystery pain, I have a friend who has EDS and absolutely swears by eucalyptus oil.
[408:24.56]I want to get an actual confirmed diagnosis first.
[408:30.02]And I have another appointment here.
[408:31.18]I have to go see a couple other doctors to find out.
[408:35.05]Hey, because I'm one of those people, I want to get a definitive diagnosis.
[408:38.43]Because I've had a couple of doctors already who have wanted to throw darts and do some potentially invasive procedures that I don't want to do unless I have to.
[408:48.57]You already talked about the nerve block.
[408:51.90]An intercostal nerve block is what one of the doctors wants to do.
[408:55.74]And I just don't fucking want to do it unless I have to.
[408:57.80]I just don't.
[409:00.88]Because it's just not really that good for you.
[409:05.61]So, I kind of want to know exactly what's going on before I do it.
[409:14.42]But yeah.
[409:16.36]Uh, I will give it a look, though.
[409:18.55]Kim gets that kind of stuff.
[409:20.49]She gets, like, eucalyptus oil and lavender oil and stuff.
[409:24.71]She has that stuff.
[409:25.87]I'll ask her about it.
[409:26.55]Hey, Stripes Beast, thanks for the $2.50.
[409:30.89]Jerma, I picked the worst time for a road trip, but I was unable to go to Hash House Ogogo and even eat out in different states.
[409:37.10]It's ridiculous.
[409:38.66]I'm excited for Gotcha Force, and I hope you have enough toilet paper to pay off the Corona Goblins.
[409:43.82]Love ya and the community.
[409:46.31]Yeah, Vegas is shutting down.
[409:51.28]It's sad.
[409:52.10]It really is.
[409:52.78]It's just, you know, you look at a place like Las Vegas, people come here to have fun and to go on vacation and enjoy themselves.
[410:01.46]And a lot of the casinos now are shutting off.
[410:04.83]You can't even go to them.
[410:06.39]Happened at Disney World.
[410:08.59]And it's, yeah, it's depressing.
[410:12.31]It is.
[410:14.28]Hopefully this shit doesn't last that much longer and we can get back to normal.
[410:22.76]I'm sorry to hear that you had a trip planned during this time.
[410:27.35]You'll be back.
[410:29.01]You'll get Hash House to go.
[410:30.03]Go at the link.
[410:31.63]Best fucking burger I've ever had.
[410:34.93]Let's put on the credits.
[410:36.41]I have a couple more bits to do.
[410:40.33]Let's put them on here.
[410:43.10]If I can do it.
[410:44.66]I should be able to.
[410:46.00]Let's swap you out here.
[410:49.28]I'm gonna f*** you.
[410:50.22]Sorry about that.
[410:52.87]These are all the subs that were today.
[410:55.61]Thanks, guys.
[410:56.01]There was a bunch of community subs that came in right now and earlier.
[411:01.23]Thanks a lot.
[411:02.69]Thanks for subbing.
[411:03.79]Thanks for watching.
[411:06.00]Thanks for continuing to be a part of this community.
[411:09.38]Appreciate it.
[411:11.90]All of you.
[411:16.33]But there are still some bits to be done.
[411:20.93]FutureGamer says, This is some monkey paw stuff.
[411:25.35]You asked for 10 extra levels and you sure got them.
[411:29.49]That's true.
[411:31.95]Thanks for the 250.
[411:32.87]This is some monkey paw stuff.
[411:39.40]Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[411:43.38]How do you even play Binding of Isaac after this?
[411:46.43]Go to fucking run and have a good night.
[411:48.91]Yeah, I might have to take a break for a while from Binding of Isaac.
[411:55.39]Binding of Isaac is gonna have to take a back seat.
[411:58.82]Because you don't come back to play after that for a while, I don't think.
[412:06.52]That's not something that just is, oh yeah, I'm gonna play that right now.
[412:17.22]So, yeah.
[412:18.62]It was too good.
[412:21.14]Aw, futz, thanks for the $25, 250 bits.
[412:26.08]That's way more than 250, it's 2,500.
[412:27.30]Thanks for the $25.
[412:34.39]Growing up, my father, sister, and I had a running joke.
[412:37.41]We would say, I'm not talking to you until blank.
[412:40.97]And we would play what we would call the silent game.
[412:44.35]I mean, it was pretty funny.
[412:45.05]It was pretty funny.
[413:16.21]Yeah, there's a lot of... You know, there's a lot of shit that's just not... That's just gonna turn off for a while.
[413:50.39]So many places, businesses, medical offices.
[413:54.21]I really hope this is done because it's really going to start to fuck up people's lives.
[413:58.49]Their day-to-day lives.
[414:10.01]I mean, like we talked about yesterday, just the fact that, you know, you've got people going to the grocery stores and buying everything and
[414:17.97]Everybody's just preparing for this catastrophe and it's just, geez.
[414:26.34]every day there's something new whether it's the government's trying to to intervene and and dump a bunch of money into you know like the markets and and no there's another case there's another thousand cases it's just it's a lot of noise it's a lot to take in and I really feel for the people that have in their life that's now getting just detonated because of it workers people that can't go to work
[414:51.69]people get laid off because there's they have to close places they have to shut down like we just talked about um the strip and everything like casinos here think about how many people work at Disney world disneyland restaurants bars it's not good
[415:16.23]And each day, hopefully, we can soon start to get an idea of just how long this might last.
[415:28.34]Hopefully it blows over soon.
[415:32.35]This is the fourth time in history that Disney has closed.
[415:35.11]Yeah, we brought it up yesterday.
[415:37.92]Disney World has been closed only a few times ever since it was opened in like 1901.
[415:44.92]Whenever the fuck it opened.
[415:46.06]Like 1960?
[415:47.21]When was it?
[415:48.51]It's insane.
[415:55.61]But yeah.
[415:57.91]Thanks for the $2.50.
[416:01.44]Take care of yourself.
[416:04.08]What the fuck are you talking about?
[416:05.40]What are you talking about?
[416:22.10]Also play Majora's Mask.
[416:22.82]Maybe.
[416:52.67]But that's, uh, sorry to hear about the thing with your girlfriend.
[416:59.18]Hopefully that you can do it again.
[417:03.06]That's the thing.
[417:03.60]There's always another time.
[417:06.48]There's always another time.
[417:07.38]It just sucks that a lot of stuff has to get delayed and pushed and moved.
[417:16.43]Thanks again.
[417:19.39]I'm not sure I would be able to do that.
[417:20.75]I don't think, like, legally speaking.
[417:21.63]I mean, it's a restaurant, and I think they have, like, code.
[417:23.82]So, probably not.
[417:39.57]Oh, you got it.
[417:40.85]There you go.
[417:41.39]He said it.
[417:41.77]He said it.
[417:42.09]He did it.
[417:42.55]Not only did you get a fucking wink, you got a shpee, too.
[418:06.74]You're going to dot, dot, dot, dot, dot me again?
[418:08.36]You're going to dot, dot, dot, dot, dot me again next time?
[418:13.66]Not you.
[418:14.48]Yeah, we can.
[418:14.86]I'm talking about everybody else.
[418:19.75]Milla38, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[418:22.51]Incredibly streamed, Jerma.
[418:25.01]Thanks so much for all the incredible content.
[418:26.55]Thanks for watching.
[418:27.23]Thanks for sticking around.
[418:28.07]Thanks for being here.
[418:31.00]Thank you.
[418:33.00]I really appreciate it.
[418:36.71]Much love to you.
[418:40.93]Now, we are going to go raid somebody.
[418:43.11]We're going to raid Kryken.
[418:45.07]Because we haven't really raided Kryken in a long time.
[418:48.27]In months and months and months.
[418:51.05]We're going to go say hello to Kryken.
[419:00.34]Currently playing Kenshi, which everyone always is telling me to play.
[419:03.36]Although, probably not going to happen.
[419:06.64]A few weeks?
[419:07.66]I haven't raided Criken in at least four or five months.
[419:11.93]Something like that.
[419:17.55]Go say hello.
[419:18.61]Hell of a fucking rat sent you.
[419:39.92]And yeah, I'll see you guys on Friday.
[419:43.45]Good night.
[419:44.45]Take care.
[419:46.29]Last minute bits.
[419:48.28]Holy shit.
[419:50.20]I just want to say that if that standing desk doesn't work out, I suggest a running desk.
[419:59.00]I have one myself, and I've been really enjoying it.
[420:00.56]All you need is a treadmill in front of your computer to really get those steps in.
[420:03.70]I mean, sometimes I fall face-first into my keyboard when I'm trying to type and run at the same time.
[420:07.48]But you know what I've... Two and a three?
[420:12.48]Oh, that's funny.
[420:15.10]Alright, see you later.
[420:16.62]No, not tomorrow.
[420:17.60]See you on Friday.
[420:20.27]Good night guys.
[420:35.31]Bye.
