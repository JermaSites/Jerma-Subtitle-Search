[00:13.17]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16.01]Welcome to the new season of Grandpa as an MLG Pro.
[00:21.87]And this is episode one.
[00:23.43]I'm glad you joined me, because this is a special episode.
[00:27.43]As you can see on the screen here, this is my montage.
[00:30.95]I'm in the process of rendering and editing.
[00:33.47]You know how it is, all you editors.
[00:36.26]And so I'm a little drunk right now.
[00:38.32]I've been drinking vodka tonics since 6 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:44.80]And what time is it right?
[00:46.54]It's 11 o'clock.
[00:48.04]Holy shit, time flies.
[00:50.34]So as you can see here, I got this timeline and Machinima wanted me to show you this.
[00:57.63]And hopefully it's the best thing you've ever seen, and I think it will be.
[01:01.37]I think it's gonna be better than The Matrix.
[01:03.53]I think it's gonna be better than any of those motherfuckers at the FaZe Clan.
[01:07.28]I got something on you, motherfucker.
[01:08.82]You and the FaZe Clan.
[01:09.88]You wanna come fuck with me?
[01:11.28]Then come take it outside, buddy.
[01:13.58]So here we go.
[01:15.00]Clicking on play right now, and it's gonna load, and... There we go.
[01:20.02]Here it is.
[01:20.66]Okay, I'll be quiet now.
[02:25.67]What the fuck is that?
[02:27.77]What is it?
[02:28.53]Premiere Pro has crashed.
[02:30.99]Well, what the fuck is that?
[02:32.69]It was like 11 minutes after that.
[02:34.34]This is taking me a long time.
[02:35.48]Let me just try and reload the project here.
[02:39.00]Reload this.
[02:39.82]Click on that.
[02:41.50]Bear with me for just a second here, folks.
[02:43.36]I apologize about this.
[02:45.45]Just get this loaded up and I'll get back into work here.
[02:49.39]And... There's nothing here.
[02:52.77]Where's my project?
[02:54.31]What happened?
[02:54.71]This is an empty timeline.
[02:56.97]Where the fuck is my project?
[02:59.39]I spent like 60 goddamn hours in this fucking program.
[03:02.56]It better be here.
[03:04.68]Jeremy!
[03:05.06]What are you doing?
[03:07.78]Are you okay?
[03:08.32]Come here.
[03:08.74]You gotta help me with this.
[03:10.50]What are you talking about?
[03:12.43]Bring like three more bottles of vodka, too.
[03:15.57]I'm gonna put one up my ass.
