[00:03.07]Go ahead and just open House Flipper.
[00:05.93]Nobody needs to know that internally right now there are animals fighting inside of your body.
[00:13.51]They don't need to know that.
[00:16.33]Nobody can hear you anyways.
[00:17.73]Nobody can hear you.
[00:18.39]It's just you and me.
[00:20.43]There's nobody else here.
[00:22.59]Remember that.
[00:23.03]It's just us.
[00:24.31]Okay, it's just us.
[00:28.83]Hey, and now I've got to change this to a different title.
[00:32.52]Hello, flippers!
[00:34.74]We haven't played this game in a while.
[00:35.70]Ugh, I gotta be... Ugh.
[00:41.92]Okay, this is like already relaxing me.
[00:45.26]New title needs to be... Zen Breathing.
[00:52.57]That's it.
[00:58.57]Go into your BIOS and disable hyper-threading.
[01:02.93]Well, that's for another day.
[01:05.31]I appreciate the help, but we're doing a zen breathing stream now because I need it.
[01:13.87]Okay.
[01:14.93]House Flipper.
[01:16.23]Let's see what they did.
[01:16.83]They added cockroaches.
[01:19.80]Oh, I don't like them.
[01:20.90]Now you can turn them into glass.
[01:23.76]Screen spacing.
[01:24.56]They did some new achievements.
[01:26.66]Hiding the UI.
[01:27.62]Bugs and improvements.
[01:29.10]They've improved the FPS.
[01:29.94]60% better FPS.
[01:33.74]Huh.
[01:35.12]Okay.
[01:35.90]Let's see.
[01:36.40]Where'd we leave off?
[01:42.47]The resolution is off.
[02:57.16]I must listen to Master.
[03:03.51]Strangely enough, when I get to the point where I pass out, Master usually takes money out of my wallet, and I just barely catch him doing it.
[03:16.61]I don't think he knows I see him do it.
[03:23.86]I found him on Craigslist as well.
[03:32.03]Okay.
[03:45.90]Six minutes.
[03:46.44]Okay.
[03:48.12]That's how we do it.
[03:48.74]I feel pretty good.
[03:52.00]Yeah.
[03:54.25]I'm starting to see my spirit animal in front of me.
[03:58.99]It's a radish.
[04:00.19]It's a radish-shaped horse.
[04:03.12]Alright, I feel zen now.
[04:04.42]Okay, what do we need to do?
[04:05.16]We have bedroom.
[04:05.90]Mount devices.
[04:06.90]That's what we do every time.
[04:07.78]I forget how to play this game.
[04:10.06]I do have skill points, too.
[04:14.26]What do I have points in?
[04:15.86]One point available.
[04:16.74]Fast hands.
[04:17.36]Faster cleaning.
[04:18.64]I'll take it.
[04:21.36]Faster house painting.
[04:23.18]Paint three walls.
[04:25.22]Less paint.
[04:25.90]Oh, this is actually pretty good.
[04:30.05]Why is prototype so weird looking?
[04:32.37]Let's do three walls.
[04:33.11]50% faster breathing.
[04:36.87]That's fine.
[04:37.43]We're good.
[04:38.55]So we are in... I have $93,000 where we left off.
[04:41.60]Mount device.
[04:43.62]What am I looking for here?
[04:46.36]Is this thing mounted yet?
[04:49.66]Use the tool.
[04:50.76]Change the tool, right?
[04:56.12]Let me just do a crash course on myself here and figure out how to do this.
[05:00.06]That's the flashlight.
[05:00.96]That's your tablet.
[05:03.40]Looking for a socket.
[05:06.98]Is there a socket in here somewhere?
[05:12.16]What is that?
[05:12.88]Do I have to move the bed?
[05:17.85]There we go, okay.
[05:19.91]Why not?
[05:20.51]Let's, uh... Turn the dial.
[05:23.90]Do I have to clean out all the gunk that's in here?
[05:32.52]What's your problem, man?
[05:34.72]Oh, okay.
[05:38.05]Now this is prototype.
[05:41.85]Turn the power on first.
[05:47.71]Yeah, you really want to reach Zen?
[05:49.31]Yeah, you'll reach permanent Zen.
[06:02.87]Local guy tells everyone to hold breath.
[06:04.75]No, that was a joke.
[06:08.83]That's not real.
[06:09.65]Don't do that.
[06:13.53]That's how you reach enlightenment in like a cartoon.
[06:15.83]Don't do it.
[06:16.65]Life is not a cartoon, guys.
[06:18.75]I need to turn the sensitivity way down here.
[06:26.06]Even more.
[06:30.52]That's better.
[06:31.04]Alright, so now I've got mounted devices.
[06:32.30]I've got two more tasks remaining.
[06:33.42]Let's put the bed back where it was.
[06:36.77]Right over there.
[06:40.06]Nice cat.
[06:41.00]Nice cat picture.
[06:42.14]Alright, open.
[06:42.80]Anything outside?
[06:45.32]No tasks.
[06:45.96]I need to paint the rooms.
[06:48.62]Don't worry.
[06:49.08]We're going to flip a house in a minute.
[06:50.70]I just want to make sure I remember how this game works.
[06:53.70]Don't tell me you've never done that before.
[06:54.96]I've walked into a screen door before.
[06:56.97]I've walked into glass before.
[06:59.35]This is not this room.
[07:00.27]Is this the bathroom?
[07:02.87]No.
[07:03.43]What room is it?
[07:06.03]Okay, paint with the colors Amaranth, Adventure, and Gray.
[07:10.65]Let's mount the device first, wherever the heck that is.
[07:14.62]You know, like, where the heck is that?
[07:33.23]What am I supposed to mount?
[07:39.49]Is this already mounted?
[07:40.25]This is mounted already.
[07:48.88]Mount device?
[07:52.06]Mount the TV?
[07:52.78]I don't see something to mount.
[08:04.31]Do you?
[08:10.27]I love how I'm Dora the Explorer-ing you guys.
[08:15.45]Does anybody know where that is?
[08:17.69]Can you find the mountable device?
[08:19.23]And then I sit there silent for 10 straight seconds.
[08:24.26]Oh, the wall!
[08:24.98]You're right!
[08:25.52]Do I have to mount a fire alarm?
[08:35.32]Where's the thing I have to mount?
[08:43.68]Whatever.
[08:44.00]Let's just paint this damn place.
[08:49.37]Amaranth.
[08:51.51]Amaranth Adventure.
[08:57.27]Alright.
[08:57.91]Load the roller.
[09:00.47]That's not a paintbrush.
[09:01.62]That is a mop.
[09:04.54]Alright.
[09:04.84]We got paint.
[09:05.60]I can do three at the same time now.
[09:14.29]What do you mean the casting couch?
[09:17.78]That's not a casting couch.
[09:19.68]That's a regular couch.
[09:24.60]I wish painting was this easy.
[09:25.72]Yeah.
[09:26.72]I also wish repairing massive amounts of water damage was easy too.
[09:34.91]It's been pretty rough the last couple days, okay?
[09:37.29]I just want to make sure you're aware.
[09:48.39]I still don't understand why there's a mountain here.
[09:49.93]I also have to do gray.
[09:58.81]I'm so glad I'm playing this right now.
[10:01.84]I would have been in a total career meltdown.
[10:06.29]You know, you guys know when you go to, like, you know, reddit.com or something, and you look on, like, some of the front pages, you look at, like, oh, livestream fails, or, oh, oh, public freakout.
[10:18.22]I would have been there.
[10:18.74]I would have been number one.
[10:21.65]If I didn't do my fucking zen breathing, I would have been number one.
[10:31.76]I would just be, I would just end my whole career.
[10:41.54]Oh, did you hear that?
[10:42.44]Oh, my God.
[10:42.94]This guy.
[10:43.70]Did you hear that what he did?
[10:44.64]Did you hear what he did?
[10:46.00]Did you hear what he said?
[10:46.98]His career is over.
[10:54.44]Holy shit, guys.
[10:55.36]His career is over.
[10:57.50]Playing video games.
[10:59.61]Oh, no.
[10:59.93]How could he ever come?
[11:00.65]How could he ever rebound from something like this?
[11:06.33]How could he ever come back?
[11:18.14]Oh, goddammit, I have to dispose of this.
[11:24.47]No, I need gray, you're right.
[11:35.78]Heated gaming moment.
[11:38.34]No.
[11:40.08]I think I have enough control of my body.
[11:44.10]By the way, this looks awful.
[11:51.45]I missed a spot.
[11:52.05]I'll get it.
[11:52.35]I'll get it.
[11:52.69]I'll get it.
[11:52.97]I'll get it.
[11:53.23]Don't worry.
[11:53.47]I'll get it.
[11:57.99]The wall is already gray.
[11:58.99]Why would I need to do this twice?
[11:59.98]Actually, no.
[12:00.32]I could have fixed that though.
[12:01.18]Because this would make sense.
[12:04.64]The guy went too far.
[12:08.18]This painter went too far.
[12:10.28]How is he ever going to return from this?
[12:18.55]Does the whole thing have to be like this?
[12:22.78]It looks worse.
[12:23.54]No, this is nice.
[12:24.42]This is like a chocolate raspberry room.
[12:28.29]This is the inside.
[12:29.29]When people come and tour this house, I'm going to stand outside here.
[12:33.34]And I'm going to be like, okay, guys.
[12:35.72]Here's what I want you to imagine.
[12:37.54]I want you to imagine a lint truffle raspberry chocolate bite.
[12:42.72]Take a step in and feel the chocolate and feel the raspberry inside of your mouth.
[12:47.35]And they're going to be like, whoa!
[12:48.27]And I'll have a little thing here.
[12:50.27]Right here.
[12:50.55]It's like a little tin that has a lint raspberry chocolate truffle in there.
[12:54.79]And they take a bite while they walk in the room.
[12:57.19]That's how you sell a house.
[12:58.47]How do you think I'm gonna do it?
[13:11.80]You tell them to eat the raspberries.
[13:17.74]I'm kind of just going over this again.
[13:20.62]It's 65%?
[13:23.19]Does it have to be like a perfect match?
[13:24.81]A perfect amount?
[13:28.71]Living room with kitchenette.
[13:33.75]Because this is at 65% still.
[13:36.73]Oh, shit.
[13:37.54]Okay, this is... Hold on.
[13:39.20]Now it needs to be equal.
[13:42.34]Can't paint the roof.
[13:43.16]Okay, hold on.
[13:48.88]I need more of that other paint.
[13:52.27]Amaranth.
[13:55.17]Amaranth.
[13:55.59]There it is.
[13:57.62]Alright, we're gonna flip our house after this.
[13:58.86]I got a lot of money.
[13:59.48]We're gonna spend it.
[14:00.08]There we go.
[14:11.25]Window and ceiling?
[14:12.29]I can't paint the ceiling.
[14:13.33]I have to paint these stupid little mini bars.
[14:22.58]Big money.
[14:22.98]We have big money coming?
[14:29.00]let me see big money huh um I see 10 bucks from wiretm thanks man appreciate the 10 bucks big money I mean that's that is pretty big money actually you're not wrong
[14:56.22]Now we're gonna get money from this and then... I don't care about mounting the device.
[15:02.19]These people can deal with their own house.
[15:07.61]You can mount your own device.
[15:08.61]I'm a painter.
[15:15.37]You think I'm a magic man?
[15:16.51]You think I'm a magic maker?
[15:18.91]No.
[15:20.89]You don't hire a painter to install your ceiling fan.
[15:23.57]I'm sorry.
[15:30.56]I mean, I guess I could be a Jack of all trades, right?
[15:34.18]What did I miss?
[15:37.00]94%?
[15:37.06]Where's the other percent?
[15:50.47]Does that count?
[15:57.19]No, that's not correct.
[16:04.76]Damn it.
[16:06.12]Hey, I'm a painter, not a magician, guys, alright?
[16:13.62]So that's 95%.
[16:20.95]Where's this other percent?
[16:28.26]Window.
[16:30.28]I can't paint the...
[16:32.10]I did that tiny little spot right there.
[16:33.80]I already got that, though.
[16:35.84]Strange.
[16:36.34]Okay.
[16:43.11]That's changed from the update, by the way.
[16:44.37]You didn't used to have to do that.
[16:46.21]It wasn't this slot to paint.
[16:51.63]Just paint the window shut.
[16:54.86]Alright, that's done.
[16:57.46]Now, mount devices.
[16:59.16]I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about, man.
[17:04.07]Does something screw in here?
[17:10.64]I'm not sure exactly what they want me to do here.
[17:15.46]Because there's an outlet here, but I can't... It's already there.
[17:19.90]Is there another outlet that I didn't see?
[17:21.14]On the table, maybe?
[17:26.66]No outlet over here.
[17:31.66]That's a switch.
[17:40.82]Is it behind this?
[17:41.90]Oh.
[17:44.78]Okay.
[17:47.28]Pull it out.
[17:53.99]What's on the wall on the left there?
[17:54.97]Alright, get it in there.
[18:05.26]screw this in shouldn't I power off the house no I got rubber gloves on I have my gloves are made out of tires shredded up tires don't you know that when you're in a car and your car gets struck with electricity uh you're gonna be fine because the tires on your car mean that if your car gets struck by lightning everyone's gonna be just fine
[18:31.00]because the lightning goes around the car.
[18:33.36]It doesn't go in and it grounds itself on the tires.
[18:42.24]It's actually the metal.
[18:43.20]It's interestingly enough.
[18:44.76]There was a guy that used to be at, like, the Museum of Science that would do a show where he would stand in a birdcage, a giant human birdcage.
[18:54.27]And it was a laser light show, and it was a scary thing where electricity was shooting, bang, bang, bang, everywhere.
[18:59.26]And this guy said, let me show you kids this.
[19:02.00]And he would put his hand up on the birdcage.
[19:05.07]And everyone in the audience is like, wait, what is he doing?
[19:07.25]Like, no, no, no, don't do it.
[19:08.39]Don't do that.
[19:09.41]And he goes, fire it up, Johnny.
[19:11.95]And they do a giant Tesla coil zap into the cage.
[19:14.93]And he like, boom.
[19:16.13]And he pretends to get like really hurt.
[19:18.36]And then he goes, no, I'm just kidding.
[19:19.84]Actually, here's the science behind it.
[19:21.36]And he explains to you that it grounds itself through the like aluminum, whatever the hell it is.
[19:26.28]It makes him completely and totally fine.
[19:28.32]Unfortunately, I think at one point it actually did hurt him.
[19:33.99]think there was like a thing where that guy actually got hurt one time uh so I don't know how I might be misremembering this but I'm pretty sure like one of those demonstrators in that like birdcage got hurt I don't know I vaguely remember that fire it up alright that's it we did it uh we have other tasks but
[19:59.51]Fuck them.
[20:00.51]Let's get the money.
[20:01.79]Let's get the money and run.
[20:02.75]Alright, back to the... That's it, right?
[20:06.59]How do I get out of here?
[20:10.03]Back to the complete order.
[20:12.35]$1,600.
[20:12.41]Now let's buy a house.
[20:16.34]I am ready to purchase a home to flip.
[20:21.32]Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[20:22.44]Remember, you always have to have a picture of your beginnings.
[20:24.74]You always have to remind yourself of where you came from.
[20:29.97]I came from apparently like a murder bunker so alright uh browser let's look for oh we got a new house listing here we need an expensive one these ones are all dumpy dog houses I want like a good one ninety four thousand where I got ninety five thousand is that enough that's not enough but like look at this place this place is nice okay I thought that said harambe
[20:57.75]And then I was like, yeah, and fucking Harambe!
[20:59.81]Like, okay.
[21:03.13]I don't have enough... I have like a thou... Alright, if I buy this house, and I don't have any money left, if I just clean it up and sell it again, what happens?
[21:17.14]I have no money left.
[21:22.86]But, look, as long as I clean this up,
[21:29.28]Oh, this is... This is Walt's house.
[21:31.50]Oh, this is... I thought I was gonna make the joke, too.
[21:35.08]I was gonna make the joke about throwing the pizza up there.
[21:37.35]Good thing they made it for me already.
[21:38.61]How did I get... I can't get the pizza.
[21:39.83]I'm not tall enough.
[21:45.29]Oh, Jesse!
[21:47.23]You threw a pizza on my roof, Jesse!
[21:50.95]Get it.
[22:00.93]This is a big house.
[22:01.63]Alright, I'm ready to clean.
[22:04.31]Any, uh, any more dump out here?
[22:06.03]Yeah, that's when Jesse, like, frisbeed the pizza on his roof.
[22:13.27]Let's all get clean.
[22:14.13]What does this say?
[22:16.04]Bark?
[22:19.12]Vio?
[22:21.26]Uh, Framped?
[22:23.20]And... That's, like, somebody's high school letters.
[22:26.52]Okay, well, whatever.
[22:27.54]See you later.
[22:27.92]It's gone.
[22:30.29]Walt threw the pizza up on it.
[22:31.91]Spoiler alert!
[22:33.67]I haven't seen the fucking thing.
[22:34.71]I haven't seen the movie yet.
[22:37.41]Somebody just drew a bunch of random stuff.
[22:38.89]Okay.
[22:40.23]Nice and clean.
[22:40.80]Imagine if I just turned the corner here and my real signature was right there.
[22:48.54]Alright, let's dispose.
[22:54.86]No, no, don't smash.
[22:56.56]Dink doink.
[22:59.34]Anything else?
[23:03.00]That's nice and clean out here.
[23:04.36]There's bugs on the roof, though.
[23:09.71]Tiling.
[23:10.21]No, we don't need that yet.
[23:10.95]Let's just get in there.
[23:14.89]Need to replace this door.
[23:19.28]Boy, it is fucking ripe in here.
[23:21.52]Hamburg.
[23:25.42]Hamburg.
[23:36.46]Let's just actually get rid of all the debris first.
[23:38.40]I don't have any money to do anything.
[23:40.42]No, don't build a wall.
[23:45.27]As long as I can get money for this.
[23:46.85]Like, I can sell the house empty.
[23:47.93]Don't you know what some people do?
[23:49.95]They buy up these beat up shit houses and then they just clean them up and then turn them around.
[23:53.65]You don't have to do anything else.
[23:56.42]Just pick up the cans on the ground and make $180,000.
[24:07.28]So this is actually supposed to be Walter White's house.
[24:09.32]That's the joke.
[24:11.62]Is this canonical?
[24:14.74]This was the living room right here.
[24:15.88]The kitchen was right over here.
[24:17.06]It actually is.
[24:17.78]This is actually canonically their house.
[24:23.52]Huh.
[24:28.85]It actually is.
[24:29.41]Alright, let's just go from... Let's get rid of all the graffiti first.
[24:37.56]Time to sue them?
[24:38.54]How?
[24:40.02]What do you mean, sue them?
[24:43.98]Now, here's the real creepy part, guys.
[24:45.38]Here's something that maybe a lot of you guys don't realize.
[24:48.18]That's somebody's house.
[24:50.54]That's somebody's real house.
[24:54.31]They didn't build a house to film that movie.
[24:56.49]That show.
[24:58.03]Somebody lives there.
[25:00.73]Somebody actually fucking lives in that house.
[25:03.41]Imagine if that was your house.
[25:05.53]And you just watched it on TV and watched all the references.
[25:08.93]And you're in your bedroom.
[25:11.02]On your iPad watching your room.
[25:16.46]They used one of the set houses in Hollywood.
[25:19.14]Are you sure about that though?
[25:20.14]Is this up in the garage?
[25:26.57]Do they film on a movie set?
[25:32.17]Not all the time.
[25:35.66]A lot of times they use real locations.
[25:42.35]That family has to move out of their house for like six months.
[25:45.01]Alright, this is all clean.
[25:53.51]This is all clean too.
[25:57.87]Do I get to keep this?
[26:03.14]How do I keep this?
[26:07.42]What do you mean, switch to clean?
[26:18.16]What am I supposed to do with this?
[26:22.78]This is not a lot of money at all.
[26:24.02]There's like $12 in here.
[26:30.64]Well, I don't want them to have this, so we need to delete it.
[26:36.25]Can I sell the dollar?
[26:38.15]Okay.
[26:38.55]I can sell the dollar for $549.
[26:46.45]That sounds like a plan.
[26:49.06]This is a lot of... Remember I told you I was broke?
[26:52.22]Not anymore.
[26:56.60]We already made out on this house.
[26:59.96]That's nine grand.
[27:00.68]Okay.
[27:02.92]It's better than what I make on YouTube.
[27:09.21]Okay, yeah.
[27:10.09]I mean... I don't know what that has to do with anything.
[27:15.28]Alright.
[27:17.64]Any more dirt everywhere?
[27:18.80]Of course there is.
[27:21.34]There's dirt everywhere.
[27:22.60]Grease stains.
[27:24.98]Piss stains.
[27:27.51]I need to clean this window.
[27:32.51]How do I do that again?
[27:33.23]Is there a way to do that?
[27:34.31]I thought there was a way I could do that.
[27:37.57]Can't sell this.
[27:42.68]No.
[27:43.96]Isn't it like, clean the window?
[27:45.38]I guess it's not an option.
[27:48.79]Alright, finish the cleanup.
[27:51.25]There's still a spider egg up here somewhere.
[27:53.01]I think it's on the outside of the house.
[27:56.49]I just heard of bugs.
[27:59.99]Was this ever in the show?
[28:00.83]I don't remember there being an inflatable pink bear.
[28:11.43]What was it in the show?
[28:13.62]I don't remember it being in the show.
[28:15.10]What was it in the show?
[28:17.46]Hold on one second.
[28:47.33]Alright, I'm sorry I'm breathing.
[28:48.61]Nah, I just, Kim need to ask me a question.
[28:54.50]Question answered.
[28:56.06]So what was the bear from?
[28:56.96]I don't remember it being from a bear.
[29:08.29]No, that's not the question that somebody just wrote.
[29:14.25]That would be pretty fucking insane.
[29:17.10]Just in the middle of a stream.
[29:19.56]Oh, yay, yay.
[29:22.44]Dirt.
[29:22.84]Get that dirt!
[29:24.24]Get the dirt out of here, man.
[29:25.48]Come on.
[29:26.76]Got it.
[29:29.82]It was in the show for an entire season.
[29:31.28]I just don't remember it.
[29:39.12]alright there we go oh you just have to open and close them these things I don't even need to spend any money here looking good alright clean Jerma what is your home address it is 444 Walter white avenue that's where we currently are alright I think we got a couple more rooms of dirt
[30:09.86]Is it a holy Bible?
[30:11.84]The secrets.
[30:18.95]Yeah, I just saw the Bible.
[30:20.05]I know you're not supposed to do that.
[30:21.17]What are you supposed to do with a Bible?
[30:25.75]I'm not fucking around at all.
[30:27.41]What do you do with a Bible?
[30:28.39]Do you bring it with you?
[30:32.02]If you move and you have a Bible in your house, it just comes with you.
[30:34.44]It just comes with you.
[30:38.56]Do you buy one Bible and then bring it with you forever?
[30:41.14]And, like, you're 90 years old and you've had the same Bible since you were, like, 12?
[30:47.59]I don't know.
[30:51.83]How many bathrooms does Walter White have?
[30:56.18]No, I'm not saying anything bad or mean.
[30:58.68]I'm just curious.
[30:59.46]That's an actual question.
[31:00.82]I don't know.
[31:03.02]Like, are you allowed to... Never mind.
[31:08.74]Never mind.
[31:09.62]Never mind, never mind, never mind.
[31:10.86]Alright, the house is clean.
[31:14.80]There's one more bug in here.
[31:16.00]I was just waiting for somebody to say, like, oh, Bible dev in the chat.
[31:23.86]Can you do it?
[31:29.44]Okay.
[31:29.56]Okay.
[31:31.91]Alright, let's clean this place up.
[31:34.41]Actually, it already is clean.
[31:35.51]Let me just replace the doors.
[31:36.61]Get rid of some of this junk.
[31:39.37]And I want to open up the kitchen.
[31:41.37]You know what I mean?
[31:44.39]Open the kitchen up.
[31:46.98]None of this closed up.
[31:47.88]What's this even here for?
[31:49.68]Makes no sense.
[31:50.58]Why do you even have walls?
[31:56.64]In fact, the bedrooms are getting their walls taken down too.
[31:58.74]Because no closed or locked doors in my house...
[32:03.34]Hey dad, uh, this is my, this is a girl I'm seeing, uh, her name's, uh, Cindy, uh, yeah, we're just gonna, like, hang out.
[32:10.11]Alright, son.
[32:12.23]Keep that door open.
[32:13.95]Not if you're gonna need to, because there ain't gonna be no fucking walls.
[32:20.04]Yeah, we're just gonna go in and study, we have a big, uh, math test tomorrow.
[32:23.16]Okay.
[32:24.78]Like, okay, I can see into the room.
[32:28.66]Are you studying in there?
[32:29.72]Yes, you are.
[32:40.15]No, I don't want walls in my kitchen.
[32:41.35]This is exactly what I want.
[32:46.14]Open floor plan.
[32:49.80]And every, like, five minutes, I'm gonna walk over there and just say something really embarrassing.
[32:55.46]I'm just gonna make sure, like, anytime that my son has a fucking girl over the house or whatever, it doesn't matter, I'm gonna have, I'm gonna have, like, a stack of his old photos.
[33:02.92]It's like a baby.
[33:04.06]Ready.
[33:05.36]Like birthday party when he was two.
[33:08.02]Oh my god, he's in a diaper?
[33:09.95]Hey, Cindy, look.
[33:12.01]Look at him in a diaper.
[33:12.69]Isn't that funny?
[33:24.17]come back and she laughs and it's kind of embarrassing and I'm like, you two kids have fun studying.
[33:30.95]And I find it really embarrassing when he sneezes and boogers will come out of his nose.
[33:34.10]Hey, did you see the one with the boogers yet?
[33:35.98]Look at that one.
[33:44.94]Dad, get out of here.
[33:45.84]Get out of here, Dad.
[33:49.83]And I'll like grab him and like mess his hair up.
[33:51.99]Like, ah, you little bastard.
[33:58.32]And he took a long time doing his hair.
[34:00.04]And he's like, fuck, Dad, what the heck, man?
[34:11.82]Hey, Cindy, did you know?
[34:12.66]He was 45 minutes in the bathroom before you came over here.
[34:16.63]Ah, nice little hair there.
[34:18.67]He's cute.
[34:19.17]He doesn't need it.
[34:19.87]He doesn't even need the gel.
[34:21.09]Don't you think, Cindy?
[34:28.16]Let's replace the doors.
[34:31.50]Because these doors are just trees.
[34:35.66]They didn't even bother to treat the wood.
[34:37.36]They just took a birch tree and just flattened it out.
[34:43.08]Let's go to the, uh, door section.
[34:49.17]They'll just be in there, like, studying.
[34:51.73]Oh, what other, like, thing is Dad gonna do?
[34:53.19]I'm just like, here's, like, the wall.
[34:56.31]Hey, you little bastard!
[34:57.41]Oh, it didn't work.
[34:57.99]What?
[35:01.76]Hey, I hope your notebook is open!
[35:04.14]Why is this not working?
[35:05.72]What?
[35:09.86]Oh, well, that would've, that was kind of, that would've been funny.
[35:13.61]Let's just look in there.
[35:16.37]And Cindy will be like, what's going on?
[35:17.83]I'll be like, I'm a multi-millionaire, Cindy.
[35:19.63]It don't matter.
[35:23.17]I was a Twitch partner for like seven years.
[35:25.61]And I had 748 million bits.
[35:30.30]And I'll reach in to try to grab his hair.
[35:33.40]I'm like, I can't reach his hair and mess it up from here.
[35:36.50]Oh, I can't have fun with my son.
[35:38.66]Good luck.
[35:45.25]Can I stop this?
[35:52.52]Then I'll go in and I'll like tap my watch and be like... WAND'S NOT GONNA MOW ITSELF!
[36:02.15]It's gonna be impossible for him to have like a... Or her to have a boy, girl, don't matter.
[36:06.57]It'll probably be possible.
[36:13.07]And even if they go somewhere.
[36:14.49]Hey, Dad, I'm going to the bumper, the go-kart course tonight with Cindy.
[36:20.51]Oh, that sounds like fun.
[36:22.47]That sounds like a lot of fun.
[36:24.13]My little tyke there.
[36:25.60]I hope you have a good time.
[36:27.14]Which one was that again?
[36:28.18]Down the street here?
[36:30.62]Yeah, I'll be back by 11.
[36:31.62]By 11.
[36:31.78]Okay, good.
[36:34.36]And I'll show up there and fucking just zoom by him and like pass my son and be like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:39.35]And I'll make sure I pull up right next to him in the middle of the drive and like pull his hair and grab his hair and shake his hair on the drive and then pass him and then leave.
[36:51.73]Why are you Jimmy Neutron's dad?
[36:58.98]Why am I LARPing this?
[37:06.06]I don't even remember what we were playing.
[37:07.85]Okay.
[37:10.51]Store.
[37:11.19]We need to get doors.
[37:13.15]New doors.
[37:15.71]I say we go with... Mahogany... What matches this house?
[37:23.30]Just the internal brown door.
[37:27.60]I need to remove this, though.
[37:28.70]How do I delete this?
[37:29.36]Just sell it, right?
[37:29.90]There we go.
[37:32.83]Let me just do all this first so I don't end up having to do it again.
[37:43.79]No doors so you can see your son studying.
[37:45.91]No, I don't... That's the potential for... That's the potential for data to be lost there.
[37:51.38]You know, I don't want my data to be taken from me.
[37:53.76]Somebody could come in and steal our data.
[37:55.34]No.
[37:56.70]There needs to be doors to the outside of the exterior, but not the interior.
[38:01.61]I missed one.
[38:02.05]Where is it?
[38:08.73]You think I'm going to have somebody come in here and steal my data?
[38:10.55]I don't think so.
[38:13.72]Can I buy more than one door at a time?
[38:16.96]That's the door to the... Okay, I need to have a better door there.
[38:20.02]And by the way, sliding doors, that's incredibly dangerous for your data.
[38:23.57]No.
[38:24.07]That's gotta be more secure than that.
[38:25.17]I mean, are you telling me all it takes is somebody to put one hand through a slider door?
[38:30.37]No.
[38:31.27]Your data's at risk.
[38:33.53]Now this can go right here.
[38:39.30]That's fine.
[38:39.88]Do it again.
[38:44.58]The whole house should just be a door.
[38:49.14]The whole house is just a bunch of doors.
[38:51.93]Every possible wall is a door, except there's one big, like, cement brick in here.
[38:58.11]No, I need to make money.
[38:59.21]We can't dick around.
[38:59.87]I just lost $100,000 while buying this place.
[39:10.24]Okay, any more doors...
[39:13.41]I kind of want to sell the fireplace, but is that like a set?
[39:15.51]That's a... How much is this?
[39:17.97]No, that's a good piece, though.
[39:19.11]Somebody will want this.
[39:22.65]I'm going to need an actually exterior door.
[39:26.61]A front door with a knocker.
[39:28.17]There's a front door right here.
[39:29.35]I'm not going to make the same mistake I've made a million times.
[39:35.77]Deadbolting myself into the house is... Okay, I did it right.
[39:38.77]I did it correct this time.
[39:43.78]Okay.
[39:45.32]Looking good.
[39:49.04]I don't want this, though.
[39:51.03]This is not fucking secure.
[39:55.03]We need something much more secure.
[39:56.37]How about a fucking wall?
[39:58.15]No, no, no, no.
[39:58.67]There needs to be a way out to the pool.
[40:04.12]Door, door.
[40:07.10]No slider.
[40:07.76]I don't want any soylent green doors.
[40:10.64]I don't want any soylent doors.
[40:13.58]Is there a double door?
[40:14.30]No, this is better.
[40:18.74]We're gonna have the two deadbolts go right into each other.
[40:30.62]Can this fit?
[40:37.21]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[40:38.71]Can I get rid of this?
[40:41.69]Oops.
[40:47.27]I got an achievement for doing this.
[40:53.22]Shit.
[40:53.58]No, this ain't gonna work.
[40:56.88]I need to sell it.
[40:59.66]This is not just a double door?
[41:00.80]What kind of video game is this?
[41:06.58]I might just close it off and make it one door.
[41:11.08]No, people like sliders.
[41:12.92]It's got to be brown, though.
[41:14.78]And it's got to be new.
[41:16.20]The other one was a piece of junk.
[41:21.98]How's that?
[41:22.42]Does that look alright?
[41:23.44]Does that look okay, guys?
[41:24.17]Does that look alright?
[41:25.15]Does this look okay?
[41:30.81]Come on.
[41:33.17]Maybe there's not enough room to place this here.
[41:41.39]What the fuck?
[41:45.21]Why?
[41:45.85]What?
[41:49.88]Do I really have... I don't want it to be the white one.
[41:51.54]This one's skinnier, though.
[41:56.06]Fine.
[41:58.94]Just look at how bad this is.
[42:01.07]I don't want anyone to be able to see into my house.
[42:04.93]I don't know what it is with people that want to look at me.
[42:06.69]If you like this, then I'm happy and I'm glad you do.
[42:10.13]But man, why would you want a giant open windows and giant like, oh, I want a bay window, huge open front space.
[42:19.70]I want to be able to sit and watch TV naked or like with my underwear eating a bowl of Captain Crunch.
[42:24.86]I don't want some fucking dickhead to walk by and be able to look in my house and see me there.
[42:32.92]Most windows have curtains.
[42:34.69]That doesn't matter, though.
[42:35.67]Like, curtains?
[42:36.77]That's not going to protect you.
[42:38.35]But what if you draw them out because it's sunny out?
[42:40.61]Oh, there's a lot of sun coming up today.
[42:43.49]And you forget, and you go get a bowl of Captain Crunch, and you get in your underwear, and you watch Spongebob right here.
[42:48.37]And your neighbor's out there walking his dog, and he turns around, and you look over, and you see him over there walking the dog, and you make direct eye contact with a mouthful.
[42:56.96]And you both sit there for one second, and then you go back and watch TV, and you pretend you didn't see him.
[43:08.05]The area is walled.
[43:09.29]Not right here.
[43:10.85]He could just stand right there and look in.
[43:16.26]He's walking his dog into your backyard.
[43:20.68]No, but what if this is in the front?
[43:21.90]Like, I know plenty of people that have big open fronts.
[43:23.76]Like, even right here.
[43:25.40]Look at this.
[43:26.48]Somebody could just drive by and see my neck and head walking around.
[43:30.03]What if I'm singing?
[43:31.29]He's gonna see me singing in there?
[43:35.07]He could be walking his dog right there, turn and look.
[43:38.03]And if I'm doing like an exercise routine right here, he's gonna see my balls.
[43:42.51]It's gonna be like jumping Jack.
[43:43.91]One!
[43:44.63]Two!
[43:44.85]Right there.
[43:45.51]Freeze frame it.
[43:46.42]He looks over.
[43:47.46]He makes direct eye contact with my penis.
[43:50.90]I'm not letting that happen.
[43:51.70]I'm not gonna... I'll never buy a house.
[43:53.24]Don't buy a computer.
[43:53.96]Don't buy a house.
[43:55.32]Don't ever do that.
[43:56.18]It's a bad idea.
[44:03.73]Why am I exercising naked?
[44:04.83]Because you... Okay.
[44:06.19]Why don't we go over this?
[44:07.65]While I just walk around in a circle.
[44:11.11]Hold on.
[44:11.47]Let me just... What happens when you work out?
[44:16.99]When you're working out heavily, you just sweat.
[44:19.70]A ton.
[44:20.40]And you sweat through your clothes and you have to take a shower.
[44:23.46]Why not just cut out the middleman and just not have to make a bunch of clothes dirty?
[44:32.93]Just do a vigorous exercise while you're naked.
[44:38.20]Canned food.
[44:41.84]Bunk beds.
[44:42.38]Should I just put a bunch of gas everywhere?
[44:44.78]Yeah, come on into the new house!
[44:46.08]Just, like, plaster him all over the place.
[44:49.41]Uh, let's get some paint out here.
[44:51.83]I am gonna brighten this place up with a lemon white.
[44:56.39]Morning yellow.
[44:58.35]We're brightening this kitchen up with some lemon-scented yellow.
[45:04.95]That should be enough.
[45:09.41]Get the gun.
[45:11.05]No, hold on.
[45:14.99]Nice.
[45:15.39]Okay, I like it.
[45:16.61]This is gonna be wild.
[45:21.15]This is gonna be wild.
[45:27.53]No gun.
[45:30.41]I'm gonna make sure this is an apartment designed for the current...
[45:35.41]Modern art styles that people love.
[45:40.54]We're gonna open up this kitchen a lot.
[45:43.14]We're gonna have our own personal little wine cellar.
[45:50.76]Get the gun.
[45:53.42]Look, I'll get the gun.
[45:54.92]Eventually, don't worry.
[45:57.28]We only have $7,400 to play with.
[45:58.12]And it's over.
[46:03.43]Jerma, don't forget.
[46:04.11]Don't forget to do that.
[46:06.63]Jerma, what are you... Jerma, what are you... Jerma!
[46:10.19]Jerma!
[46:10.77]Jerma, you forgot that part.
[46:12.03]Jerma!
[46:14.01]Jerma!
[46:15.42]I got it.
[46:15.82]Uh, what is it?
[46:23.64]Stop right there.
[46:24.16]That's fine.
[46:30.17]Jerma, we have
[46:37.36]Consume the berries.
[46:43.31]I need more paint.
[46:44.27]Parole.
[46:48.03]Is he still doing an Anor Londo?
[46:49.39]I'm thinking of a different video game.
[46:53.77]This is Zen breathing.
[46:56.83]Am I painting over wallpaper?
[46:59.13]What, you've never done that before?
[47:00.17]This is a video game.
[47:03.28]There's no... What am I supposed to do here?
[47:07.37]It's a video game.
[47:10.91]What do you want me to do?
[47:13.66]Peel off the wallpaper?
[47:16.08]No.
[47:16.40]In this video game universe, it's a new wall.
[47:24.52]Okay.
[47:25.44]That's good.
[47:26.06]Ooh.
[47:28.39]Lovely.
[47:29.01]Absolutely lovely.
[47:31.19]Now, what contrasts well with yellow?
[47:34.93]Magenta?
[47:36.79]I still have a lot of this yellow paint, though.
[47:38.01]We're going to hold on to it.
[47:41.11]Not pink.
[47:41.55]I'm not doing pink.
[47:45.62]When did I stop playing Prototype?
[47:47.16]When I couldn't play it on PC because my computer's too good.
[47:50.30]You think that's a joke?
[47:51.14]I wish that was a kidding.
[47:52.62]It's not.
[47:53.48]My computer's too good to play Prototype.
[47:58.70]This is all junk.
[48:04.81]It's all junk.
[48:08.11]I need a place.
[48:08.79]I want a place.
[48:09.71]I want a clean home.
[48:10.51]What did they say?
[48:10.95]I need a place and I want a place for what?
[48:12.62]Bookshelf?
[48:13.12]Okay, I'm going to make that one idiot happy.
[48:18.30]I base all of my property decisions based on if there is or is not a bookshelf in the house.
[48:32.55]Vegas?
[48:33.09]No.
[48:34.43]No.
[48:34.49]No.
[48:40.57]Ooh, no.
[48:43.93]I think it's gonna be white.
[48:44.97]Yeah.
[48:45.39]White.
[48:45.81]The details will be... We'll do white, white.
[48:50.56]White, white.
[48:51.84]Uh... Mm-hmm.
[48:53.10]No.
[48:54.46]White, white.
[48:57.00]White, white.
[48:58.04]Venga.
[48:59.78]Gray.
[49:00.78]White, white, gray.
[49:02.62]Bye now.
[49:03.50]Watch this guy.
[49:04.02]Watch this stupid idiot that's gonna pop up right here.
[49:07.44]Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, that's what I'm looking for.
[49:11.59]I'd increase the property value by $50,000.
[49:13.85]Where can this go?
[49:20.13]Right here is alright.
[49:23.02]Watch this, ready?
[49:25.32]Oh, did he put it in?
[49:27.44]Did he put it in?
[49:27.98]He put it in.
[49:28.36]It'd be nice to have a place for all of our books.
[49:35.62]Not all my documents will fit in there.
[49:37.38]What are you doing?
[49:40.60]Yeah, your documents have a good, like, view of the TV.
[49:44.58]That's a kind of... That's a small TV, though, don't you think?
[49:47.64]It only has, like, enough 4x3 ratio.
[49:49.47]And it's, like, on the ground.
[49:51.15]This TV sucks.
[49:56.43]Alright, we need to come over to the living room.
[49:57.87]I like the wood down here.
[50:01.65]Yellow into... I need to see the paints.
[50:05.27]I can't just choose.
[50:14.36]What color do I want for the... Bright peach.
[50:17.88]That might be alright.
[50:20.52]Mandarin orange.
[50:24.62]Spring?
[50:25.08]No, this is just turning into like an Easter rabbit's house.
[50:28.93]We're not doing any of these colors.
[50:30.25]It'll turn into Easter.
[50:31.81]That'll be the Easter bunny.
[50:35.10]Should it just be the Easter?
[50:35.90]No, this is not the Easter bunny's house.
[50:37.50]Coffee with milk?
[50:42.02]Almond.
[50:42.21]Almond.
[50:49.29]Spring grass.
[50:49.88]Sunny yellow.
[50:51.80]Sky blue.
[50:53.22]Gray.
[50:54.94]Blood.
[50:59.14]Pistachio.
[50:59.96]No, that's still in the Easter Bunny house.
[51:03.20]Gray fox.
[51:04.82]Icy blue.
[51:05.79]Black.
[51:07.81]Yellow.
[51:08.21]Now it's the Bumblebee house.
[51:09.91]Nothing goes with yellow, does it?
[51:17.17]Does anything go with yellow?
[51:18.09]I mean, gray could go with yellow, right?
[51:21.18]Yeah, that'll look alright.
[51:24.76]That should be fine, let's see.
[51:33.01]Yeah, that's alright.
[51:33.65]It's a little too dark though.
[51:38.57]That's fine, that looks good.
[51:41.37]That looks fine.
[51:45.94]We need some lamps in here, though.
[51:47.44]That's very important.
[51:51.40]Green is worse than yellow.
[51:57.56]Look, we don't like the yellow eventually.
[51:59.44]I can turn that to like a lemon zest.
[52:01.80]Doesn't have to be full-on yellow.
[52:07.44]This is disgusting.
[52:11.98]Well, just, just relax.
[52:14.86]Hey, you don't have to live here.
[52:21.56]Make it orange.
[52:22.52]Hey, you know, Burger Boys painted his bedroom like bright electric pumpkin orange.
[52:31.45]And he was always like, yeah, it's like fucking shit.
[52:35.29]It was so fucking ugly.
[52:39.95]It was actually like, it was nauseating being in the room.
[52:48.23]He loved it though.
[52:52.19]You know what?
[52:52.63]His room was so orange, it almost smelt like when you peeled an actual orange.
[52:56.73]You know how your brain sometimes does that to you?
[53:00.08]I could smell like orange juice when I was in the room, even though that wasn't even real.
[53:11.09]And eventually, like, he started to want to have, like, girls come over.
[53:14.41]So he'd be, like, eventually, like, ah, shit.
[53:17.02]I can't really have, like, a bright orange room.
[53:18.88]Because I guess people would come over and be like, ah, what the fuck is this?
[53:25.36]Oh.
[53:26.44]He's fucking hilarious.
[53:37.74]Your childhood bedroom was bright orange?
[53:41.09]Some bold colors do look pretty good though.
[53:48.09]The darker you go, obviously, the smaller your house looks.
[53:53.17]That's a quick tip.
[53:54.13]Quick interior design tip.
[53:57.47]The darker your walls are, the smaller your house is.
[54:03.88]Look it up.
[54:08.16]Yeah, like you perceive the space is smaller.
[54:14.33]Alright, how does that look?
[54:15.75]Pretty bad, but it's alright.
[54:25.65]Room 99M2.
[54:26.49]I feel like that's not what I would name this room.
[54:32.04]I would name it the living quarters.
[54:35.48]I need some lamps because I can't see.
[54:38.38]I kind of dig this whole wood here and then the brick.
[54:45.77]I don't hate this.
[54:48.51]Give me some lamps.
[54:49.71]Or some resets.
[54:50.43]Can this switch even work?
[54:52.34]Is there a switch for this light?
[54:57.12]Ah.
[54:58.58]See, what's wrong with this?
[55:00.40]It's a little... It does look like a dessert.
[55:04.94]It does.
[55:05.34]This looks like something you would order.
[55:11.29]Alright, I don't like it.
[55:12.55]I'm changing it.
[55:13.09]I'm changing it to the lighter one.
[55:15.67]Let's see how it looks when we change that.
[55:16.84]We're gonna go with the lighter one, the like off-white here, whatever it's called.
[55:22.10]Faded Lemon, there it is.
[55:24.68]This will look good.
[55:26.10]You guys will be surprised at how much you'll actually like this.
[55:33.35]Hey, that's a lot better.
[55:36.57]That makes me feel right at home.
[55:41.27]You're a Faded Lemon?
[55:47.35]What?
[55:53.89]Light blue?
[55:54.59]Oh, light blue would be so good!
[55:58.39]Light blue would be so good here!
[56:00.15]Oh, it would be beautiful!
[56:02.31]Get out of here!
[56:10.99]Ice blue?
[56:11.76]No, that's too weird.
[56:14.57]Indigo, azure, navy blue.
[56:17.44]Do they even have like a royal blue, sky blue?
[56:19.98]I don't think they have just like a little tinted blue.
[56:24.96]This is the lightest you can get here.
[56:26.36]Royal blue or sky blue?
[56:29.72]I think I'm gonna say sky blue.
[56:33.64]Actually, royal blue is probably a little bit... Yeah, that matches more.
[56:37.86]Let's just take a look at it, see if we hate it.
[56:45.34]Perfect.
[56:48.44]Okay, and that's it.
[56:49.18]We just needed one little strip to make it change up the pace a little bit there.
[56:57.14]Do I have any more level up points from my painting?
[56:59.00]I really need it.
[57:01.23]This looks like a toy kitchen.
[57:05.09]We'll just give it some time, okay?
[57:07.41]Trust me when I say you are gonna love it.
[57:09.85]Remember that show, Love It or List It?
[57:12.63]We're gonna get you inside of your old house.
[57:16.34]And we're gonna make it look so much better.
[57:18.34]And then you have to decide if you want to sell or if you want to stay.
[57:21.67]I got it.
[57:30.13]I already know somebody's yelling right now.
[57:33.06]You don't have to yell so loud.
[57:33.90]I'm doing it.
[57:36.32]I hate leveled or listed.
[57:37.52]They never choose to move in a bigger house.
[57:41.98]Don't you know?
[57:43.46]It doesn't matter.
[57:46.21]Nobody wants to actually move out of where they're comfortable, right?
[57:54.47]Don't you know?
[57:55.09]Yeah, that's going to be a sell from me.
[58:07.92]Big houses are annoying.
[58:08.94]I like having a room for each thing that I do.
[58:16.31]I like to have a separate room to go to the bathroom, a separate room to go to sleep, a separate room to view entertainment quality programming, and then a separate room for working, like an office or a study.
[58:44.59]I also like having a separate room to smoke.
[58:46.51]A smoking room and a drinking room.
[58:48.89]I like a separate room to read.
[58:50.31]A book room.
[58:54.10]A separate room to shower.
[59:03.56]I need a dog room.
[59:04.46]I have a dog.
[59:05.52]You need a separate room for the dog.
[59:10.04]And I'm at least like four or five bedrooms.
[59:12.82]I guess I'll get bored of sleeping in the same place.
[59:15.77]And each one of those rooms have to be a different theme.
[59:19.37]So I never get bored.
[59:34.00]Why do you have a smoking room?
[59:36.40]Because you don't want the house to smell like smoke.
[59:38.14]So you close off a room.
[59:41.84]And you have your cigars in there.
[59:50.81]No, I don't smoke.
[59:53.57]I need other lights turned on, though.
[59:56.57]Can I turn those on?
[59:57.37]I need more light.
[59:58.83]Big time.
[59:59.33]Is there a light in the garage?
[60:06.93]You don't have a goddamn garage light?
[60:13.13]What are you, dumb?
[60:20.13]You're in my garage?
[60:23.35]Hey, so this Bitcoin thing, man.
[60:30.21]There is a light in your garage.
[60:34.84]That was a reference to here in my garage.
[60:41.58]I was making a reference.
[60:43.79]I need another lamp or something because this is just depressing how little light there is here.
[60:51.33]What are we going to get?
[60:52.57]I'm going to say we need to have lamps, lights, fixtures, installations, home electronics.
[61:04.39]Hmm.
[61:08.09]There we go.
[61:08.67]A sconce.
[61:10.87]Fluorescent lights.
[61:12.36]Put them everywhere.
[61:24.22]Get like McDonald's heat lamps all over the house.
[61:30.33]No, I hate those.
[61:32.09]No.
[61:32.29]Well, they're going in.
[61:35.59]Everybody needs a McDonald's heat lamp.
[61:41.50]That's better.
[61:42.68]Couple more.
[61:44.33]We got a small fluorescent light.
[61:48.27]Big fluorescent light.
[61:49.21]There we go.
[62:10.99]I love it.
[62:12.91]I love it.
[62:16.03]One more right over here.
[62:21.97]One more here.
[62:28.82]Do it!
[62:29.18]That's because the wall is broken.
[62:35.50]I'll fix it later.
[62:39.97]Alright, let's keep going here with the blue.
[62:42.17]I'm gonna take the blue.
[62:48.51]The brighter the room, the larger it appears.
[62:50.23]See, you get it.
[62:52.65]You get it.
[62:53.03]You actually get it.
[62:57.80]I gotta move this thing.
[63:04.84]Actually, it looks like a prison now.
[63:06.10]No, it does not.
[63:06.72]What prison do you know has separate bedrooms?
[63:10.58]Like this.
[63:11.90]There's a privacy door.
[63:14.50]I don't know a prison with a privacy door.
[63:16.02]Sorry.
[63:21.84]Everyone.
[63:22.44]No, no.
[63:23.58]Excuse me.
[63:24.26]Prisons don't have a privacy door.
[63:29.17]Haven't you ever seen a TV show, a video game, or a movie?
[63:33.77]They're in barred cages.
[63:36.33]That's it.
[63:37.45]Ever.
[63:48.07]from every video game and TV show you've ever seen.
[63:56.02]And when the main character gets there, he's always like... He meets his cellmate.
[64:00.65]And the cellmate says something really fucking crazy.
[64:03.89]And then the main character, who's definitely... Well, I'm not used to prison.
[64:07.61]I'm not supposed to be here.
[64:08.57]The camera pans out to outside the cell.
[64:11.70]And it does... It shows both characters.
[64:13.50]And then the main character runs up to the bars and goes like... Oh my god!
[64:16.54]I'm not supposed to be in here!
[64:18.22]Okay.
[64:24.34]Okay.
[64:26.81]Then it cuts to, like, the other people trying to get him out.
[64:34.37]Here, why don't you sit down and have some of this toilet wine?
[64:37.66]Oh, fuck!
[64:38.18]Cut.
[64:38.70]Same exact place.
[64:39.88]God, grab the bars.
[64:40.96]Face into the bars.
[64:41.90]Not quite, like, through the bars, but, like, really... What the heck?
[64:46.18]I gotta get out of here!
[64:55.21]Let me put the radiator on there.
[65:08.38]Get on there.
[65:20.53]It's a very satisfying twisty noise, don't you think?
[65:24.49]They did a good job making it satisfying to do the twisties.
[65:28.13]Are all these sockets fine?
[65:29.97]They look like they're fine.
[65:32.92]Anything broken, run down, destroyed, bent?
[65:39.34]Okay, we need to fix this.
[65:45.92]Ooh, dark in there.
[65:50.84]Alright, let's do the garage while we're out here.
[65:57.25]What do you do to a garage?
[66:02.59]This is dingy, right?
[66:26.09]Well... I'm trying to do it to the ground.
[66:30.05]I guess I can't.
[66:35.08]This is gonna be a cool garage tile in the garage you what we want cement Hold on.
[66:41.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait floor panels floor panels.
[66:43.52]There we go Just in case you know your guard you need a car to sit on oh
[67:10.05]Hey, it's gonna be real comfy in here.
[67:13.87]It's an extra room.
[67:16.42]Alright, before anybody freaks out here, excuse me.
[67:19.68]What is with everybody that has a house?
[67:23.46]Let's talk about square footage and let's talk about real estate here.
[67:27.84]Why is the garage just... Yeah, that's the garage.
[67:30.55]It's just a big fucking cement wall with floors and it's huge.
[67:36.40]Uh, that's, look at how much real estate this is.
[67:38.94]This is a huge room.
[67:42.82]Use your garage for like an extra room.
[67:44.72]You can make it like a den.
[67:46.44]That's where the cars go.
[67:47.28]That's fine.
[67:48.42]The car can still come in here, but there's a TV and an Xbox and a PlayStation in here.
[67:54.54]Storage.
[67:55.49]Look at this.
[67:56.29]This is bigger almost than the whole house.
[67:58.05]This is bigger than the whole living room.
[68:00.69]Have it be a full room and then, oh, honey, I'm home.
[68:03.31]You'll see.
[68:03.73]I don't need to talk about it.
[68:08.13]It's a two-car garage.
[68:11.50]That's fine.
[68:12.08]No, it's a two-car garage, and it's also a four-person bedroom.
[68:16.94]So you'll see, this is gonna be like the baby room, you know what I mean?
[68:18.96]Like the... The baby room, the crib can be like right over here.
[68:23.52]All the baby toys, all the stuff.
[68:25.88]And then you just have to be really quiet when you come in.
[68:27.78]Dad comes home, I'm home.
[68:29.60]Dad's home!
[68:30.94]It's like the kids are in here sleeping, and you just pull the car in.
[68:36.51]You know, the car just like drives slowly right into here and parks.
[68:40.57]Turn the car off.
[68:42.29]There you go.
[68:47.24]It's so much space.
[68:48.52]We waste so much space.
[68:50.60]And what are you going to use it for?
[68:51.62]Well, you know, I like to use my garage for storage.
[68:55.56]Get rid of that shit.
[68:56.38]What do you have it for?
[68:57.18]No, no, no.
[68:58.08]You see, I have nine lamps.
[69:00.35]Why?
[69:00.85]I just have them.
[69:04.26]Oh, I need to have, I got to put my tools in there too.
[69:06.14]What tools?
[69:07.16]Oh, you know, my hammer, my wrenches, my electrical work stuff.
[69:11.66]Have you ever replaced anything with any of those tools?
[69:15.26]Never.
[69:15.64]Not one time.
[69:16.88]Okay.
[69:17.74]So what happens then?
[69:19.25]Well, what happens is I get way over my own head and I try to fix it with my giant amount of tools.
[69:24.65]And then I just call a guy that actually can do it.
[69:26.77]And my tools are useless in the first place.
[69:30.60]I love my garage.
[69:31.60]It's great.
[69:32.26]I love the space.
[69:32.86]I love going out there and using my tools and hitting stuff with a wrench for a minute.
[69:37.62]I gotta have my workshop out there.
[69:38.94]It's its own damn space.
[69:43.78]It's its own damn room.
[69:48.98]And then you just put stuff in here that just rots for years.
[69:53.31]And then eventually you gotta go, like, when you move out eventually, what do you do?
[69:58.10]Oh, like, I'm in a garage.
[69:59.87]Oh, I have... Oh, what's in here?
[70:02.83]Oh, that's my tool bench that I haven't used in six years.
[70:05.49]Oh, we gotta put it in a dumpster because we're moving.
[70:10.93]Make it a room, and make it a good room, and get the heat in here.
[70:13.23]It can be cement, that's fine.
[70:19.12]Alright, so that's good.
[70:20.44]I need a lamp in here.
[70:24.50]You're projecting.
[70:25.94]Alright, faster plaster.
[70:30.35]Let's do that.
[70:32.77]Any more?
[70:34.10]No, shit.
[70:39.38]Nine lamps.
[70:39.98]Yeah, might as well put a bunch of storage in here too.
[70:45.54]Yeah, like old sofas.
[70:47.93]I'm going to sit... Okay, I'm going to sit here right now and I'm going to think of what is currently in...
[70:57.55]The garage.
[70:58.47]Are you ready?
[70:59.67]Here we go.
[71:03.11]Uh, four bags of clothing donations.
[71:06.55]Okay.
[71:09.35]Two space heaters that I haven't used in two years.
[71:14.81]Um... Paint.
[71:18.31]Like six, uh, six just giant buckets of paint.
[71:28.33]A bunch of old electronic shit that I haven't used in like six years.
[71:34.37]By the way, I don't have a garage.
[71:39.39]Whose house have I been in?
[71:43.27]Whose house was I in?
[71:48.25]Alright, let's get like lamps in here.
[71:49.93]Or at least lights.
[71:50.87]I know what I'm going to do.
[71:51.59]Of course, I'm going to put... Are you kidding me?
[71:55.59]Fluorescent.
[72:11.79]How do you pronounce fluorescent?
[72:15.57]Huh.
[72:17.17]Interesting.
[72:39.48]I'm going to move him.
[72:40.04]Don't worry.
[72:40.38]Everybody calm down.
[72:45.20]Essence of flower.
[72:46.20]Okay.
[72:46.56]Where's my light switch?
[72:48.26]God damn it.
[72:49.04]Where's the light switch?
[72:54.50]No, it's because it wasn't on all.
[72:58.49]Modern light.
[72:59.13]Standard light switch.
[73:00.01]Get it on there.
[73:03.01]Do you see what I'm talking about here now?
[73:07.33]I would love to have an exercise room.
[73:10.05]You know, I just don't have enough space in my house.
[73:14.05]If only I had a giant room, SpongeBob, apparently, to be able to do these things.
[73:27.11]Okay.
[73:28.83]It's too dark.
[73:29.57]Buy a garage door.
[73:30.49]I already have a garage door.
[73:34.83]Speaking of which, get some beds in here, dummy.
[73:36.87]I need some better floor panels and floor... No, we need

[74:02.48]Oh, this sucks.
[74:03.96]Oh, this is wood again.
[74:14.15]I hate it.
[74:17.23]This is just brick.
[74:18.27]No, that's not a cozy room.
[74:20.21]Plaster.
[74:21.51]Plaster bucket?
[74:22.45]This wasn't in the game before.
[74:23.38]What is this?
[74:37.27]Wait, I don't have anything on here.
[74:43.67]You can now plaster in the hole.
[74:46.07]Now you can put the plaster in the hole in the wall.
[75:02.09]Plaster over this?
[75:05.09]What?
[75:11.55]Imagine if you tried to plaster that much damage.
[75:17.36]Well, I guess I don't need this.
[75:25.22]Show us the hole.
[75:25.72]It's right here.
[75:26.28]I can't plaster it.

[78:15.39]Oh, these are floor tiles only.
[78:16.77]God damn it.
[78:23.35]How the hell did I do this before?
[78:25.05]Wall panels.
[78:26.29]Wall tiles.
[78:26.93]There we go.
[78:29.81]I kind of like these.
[78:32.67]Just do it white.
[78:42.83]I hate to have to do this one by one.
[78:54.58]Now it's just a giant bathroom.
[78:56.14]And you know what?
[78:56.54]Fine.
[78:56.96]Fuck it.
[78:57.28]We're going to put a bathroom in here.
[78:58.28]Can I?
[78:58.52]There's a light socket in there.
[79:00.99]I can put a bathroom in here.
[79:04.05]There's two outlets in here.
[79:04.97]A toilet can go there.
[79:14.87]This is going to cost money.
[79:17.25]There's no time limit here, right?
[79:21.94]Is it an electrical toilet?
[79:24.32]How do you think the water goes in and out of your toilet?
[79:28.28]You connect it with the cord and the data goes out.
[79:32.14]You put the ethernet cable in.
[79:34.89]You flush the toilet and it just goes into the cloud and deletes.
[79:41.87]I need to buy like three of these.
[79:54.70]Oh, that must be a shit connection.
[79:57.90]Somebody play the drums for that guy.
[80:00.70]That was a good one.
[80:09.28]I don't have enough signal to go to the bathroom.
[80:13.23]Yeah, I can't flush the toilet.
[80:15.15]My Wi-Fi is not good enough.
[80:19.11]Sorry, poor connection.
[80:20.73]You just took a huge dump.
[80:30.68]What is this?
[80:32.22]Oh, that's the garage door.
[80:33.14]I wonder if I should just put like seven doors here.
[80:34.82]No.
[80:34.88]The car still needs to be able to go in there.
[80:42.99]I need more lights by the garage door.
[80:44.21]Don't worry, I will.
[80:45.89]There's going to be plenty of cool shit in this garage.
[80:55.27]Car wash.
[80:57.79]Car wash.
[81:01.71]Oh, man.
[81:05.33]Carpet.
[81:05.97]Yeah, this is carpet in the garage.
[81:08.31]You might not have been here when we talked about it.
[81:11.19]I went on a whole... There's a whole ordeal as to why.
[81:21.08]Go to the VOD and rewind like 15 minutes.
[81:24.92]There's a full like 17 minute conversation about this.
[81:32.34]The resale value of this house.
[81:33.54]This is another full room.
[81:35.20]I know it's not caught in the square footage, but that's a crock of shit anyways, by the way.
[81:45.85]Need more of those.
[81:46.77]Almost done.
[81:48.39]I think that'll be good.
[81:52.83]Oh, hello, VOD.
[81:53.81]I already had a light switch in here.
[81:58.54]No, this one's, like, dirty.
[82:01.12]That one's better.
[82:04.36]That one was covered in cigarette smoke.
[82:10.61]Oh, hello, VOD.
[82:11.53]How are you?
[82:13.31]You have finals tomorrow?
[82:16.15]Oh, well, hopefully you do well in your finals, man.
[82:19.33]Finals now?
[82:22.56]Seems, uh... Middle of July.
[82:25.30]Well, good luck regardless.
[82:33.23]I thought most finals were in April into May.
[82:37.21]Late May.
[82:46.54]Summer classes?
[82:47.38]Okay.
[82:48.20]Good luck, man.
[82:50.54]Hopefully you do very good on them.
[82:51.74]I hope you get an A+.
[82:54.74]No, I don't.
[82:55.58]We've talked about that before.
[82:56.45]I hope you get a B+.
[83:00.24]Hope you get whatever grade is good enough to make you know that you did a pretty good job, but you didn't try too hard, you know what I mean?
[83:14.28]Look, all you... Do you get A pluses?
[83:18.71]Getting A pluses means you can, like, memorize the book better than Steve can, you know what I mean?
[83:23.55]That's all school is.
[83:25.83]It's just, can you remember these things that you read?
[83:29.45]Where's the real knowledge?
[83:30.47]Where's the knowledge creation?
[83:32.43]Where's the knowledge creation class?
[83:35.97]You got A pluses?
[83:36.83]You could retain knowledge like water.
[83:40.05]Where's the knowledge creation?
[83:52.02]Galaxy brain.
[83:58.11]Jeremy Jeremy you buy you you got a D. You got a C on this test.
[84:02.83]Why what's why have you done that?
[84:04.25]Why are you come on?
[84:05.31]You can do better than that And I always stood up in the middle of class and stood on my desk and would say Yeah, some of you guys with the a pluses.
[84:16.62]Oh good.
[84:16.92]You can open a book and you can remember it tomorrow I Create knowledge and then I pulled out a fucking magic wand I do like a card trick bang right in front of them Flowers come out of the cards
[84:38.12]And then I get Saturday detention every week.
[84:42.36]Do they clap?
[84:43.34]No.
[84:44.22]Pretty much as stone cold of a face as you could have.
[84:49.01]Then you'd hear maybe a cough after about 12 seconds of dead silence.
[85:02.85]And then I had to sit at my own lunch table.
[85:07.01]This is true, by the way.
[85:09.87]I swear to God.
[85:11.27]Like, forget about, like, the bullshit that I just said there.
[85:13.25]I actually... I had to sit at my own lunch table.
[85:15.73]They called it private dining in my high school.
[85:21.05]If you were, like... If you were, like, an unmanageable little shit, you had to eat at, like, a separate table.
[85:30.14]Oh, yeah.
[85:30.38]I couldn't hang out with my friends.
[85:31.70]Yeah, this looks good.
[85:37.10]Although I'm not, like... God damn it.
[85:44.58]I know, I know, I can see the window.
[85:45.84]I know.
[85:46.16]I can see it.
[85:47.54]Don't worry.
[85:51.66]I'm gonna clean the window.
[85:52.80]I'm gonna clean it.
[86:00.68]The worst part about it though is I never did anything bad.
[86:07.45]People would throw oranges across the fucking entire cafeteria.
[86:11.87]And they'd be like, excuse me, don't do that, you're a guy, excuse me.
[86:17.82]I do a magic trick on a desk and all of a sudden I'm like, I'm like a serial killer.
[86:31.52]Alright, clean the window.
[86:34.44]I think, why can I not actually clean this window?
[86:37.50]Did they take that part out of the game?
[86:38.71]Remember like the whole thing with the, I guess the window's already clean.
[86:50.19]That's good.
[86:51.31]I'm happy with this room.
[86:53.43]This room makes me feel at home.
[86:55.41]Okay, now we gotta make it a real room, though, guys.
[86:58.13]I have to remember, this would be room for the car.
[87:07.06]Bed grill.
[87:08.92]Grill.
[87:10.72]Bed, uh, Oda.
[87:12.72]Double bed.
[87:14.20]That's not bad.
[87:14.82]Alright, let's do instead of cream... Back needs to be...
[87:20.75]Cream.
[87:22.33]Frame.
[87:24.85]Cream.
[87:34.70]Okay.
[87:37.30]Run for the car.
[87:39.03]And we need to run for the crib.
[87:44.59]Color can be... And look, we can do light blue.
[87:47.45]Oh, it's not... It's not gonna match?
[87:52.19]No, what the fuck?
[87:52.97]I mean, it kinda does.
[88:03.08]Alright.
[88:03.42]Alright, look.
[88:04.38]I know this is a good place for the bed, and I understand why.
[88:08.96]It's because during the middle of the night, this is a really, really easy access to wiping your burgers on the wall.
[88:16.69]It's right there.
[88:17.27]It's tile-proof.
[88:23.82]I had a big problem with that when I was younger.
[88:26.74]I had my bed right next to a wall and I would just pick my nose, turn over and just wipe it on the wall.
[88:50.29]These drive my motherfucking crazy.
[88:54.06]Get a tissue!
[88:54.86]What are you doing?
[88:55.84]What is wrong with you?
[88:57.12]Get a tissue!
[88:58.02]Yeah, guys, I was like 11.
[89:03.68]This didn't happen last weekend, okay?
[89:06.91]You guys make it sound like I did this, like, this morning.
[89:12.59]I'm gonna need some, like, a desk in here.
[89:17.42]How much is... Can I put a car in here?
[89:20.34]How much is a car?
[89:27.24]I guess I can make lines for the car.
[89:30.04]Genius!
[89:31.48]Absolutely genius!
[89:33.56]We're gonna make two lines here, like a parking spot.
[89:36.08]And then you'll know not to go further than there, or further to the right or the left.
[89:44.49]It's a white tile, where are they?
[89:45.51]I need floor tiles.
[89:52.64]Floor tile... Just... Right here, we need white.
[89:56.66]Perfect.
[90:00.00]No, no, no, no, no.
[90:00.84]Dick.
[90:02.98]Okay, so the car... This opens.
[90:04.28]Let's see.
[90:07.56]Fuck.
[90:07.70]I have to change that.
[90:09.08]I have to make that better.
[90:09.82]Okay, so here we go.
[90:12.51]We'll make it a standard spot.
[90:14.31]So, like, right here.
[90:28.06]And a little bigger.
[90:28.94]That's fine.
[90:34.08]And look, if you get home really late and you're really tired, you just come in.
[90:38.88]You'd end up opening the door here.
[90:40.58]Wait, no, fuck, you can't get out of the car.
[90:50.79]How are you supposed to get out?
[90:53.53]This has got to move.
[90:54.39]Alright, the crib can go over here.
[90:56.86]No, actually, this can just stay where it is.
[91:06.07]Don't wake the fucking baby.
[91:07.35]Alright.
[91:08.29]Then that's fine.
[91:10.91]So then we just need to move it to here.
[91:11.95]I mean, this could be a two-car garage.
[91:15.65]Or like a bike.
[91:16.77]This is like the bike lane over here.
[91:18.09]I need to change this, though.
[91:27.58]Come on, pick this shit up.
[91:35.06]Pick it up!
[91:37.38]Oh, whatever.
[91:39.02]Uh, I need to re-carpet it.
[91:44.91]What's this one?
[91:45.67]Was it fitted blue?
[91:48.77]What color is this carpet?
[91:50.47]No, not E-T.
[91:52.41]Carpet.
[91:54.57]It was fitted blue, right?
[91:57.69]Yes.
[92:03.24]Gotta get this right.
[92:06.98]Okay, so one, two.
[92:11.11]That sounds good.
[92:14.99]Well, this is better.
[92:16.23]This is better.
[92:16.73]Just have it be like this yellow or... Is this white carpet?
[92:21.81]We can just make this yellow one.
[92:23.09]It's white enough.
[92:24.63]Gray, whatever.
[92:25.29]This is fine.
[92:27.10]Oh, fuck.
[92:27.78]Well, actually, this could work.
[92:28.68]It's like this is drive onto this.
[92:30.92]Your car can have a rest.
[92:38.01]Uh, float.
[92:38.55]No, just go back to the fucking tiles and the... There we go.
[92:41.03]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[92:43.59]So, door has to open here, so this is right there.
[92:46.63]Can be fine.
[92:47.41]That's good.
[93:00.54]There we go.
[93:01.10]Perfect.
[93:02.36]Much better.
[93:04.76]Is that even?
[93:05.30]It is.
[93:08.74]I need to do the carpet again because I missed a few spots here.
[93:14.18]Blue carpet.
[93:15.38]Blue.
[93:15.80]There it is.
[93:28.96]Looking good.
[93:31.38]Looking good.
[93:32.04]Okay.
[93:33.71]You drive in, door closes, you're right here.
[93:36.59]I'm gonna put like a shelf right here.
[93:38.03]Get like a bookcase.
[93:42.31]Or a shelf.
[93:43.75]Uh, hanging shelf works.
[93:46.21]Just make it, that's fine.
[93:48.37]Right when you come in, put your keys and shit right here.
[93:51.13]You'll get out right there.
[93:54.93]What, why, why is this bright?
[93:56.49]What the, what is going on here?
[93:57.57]I don't want to see a lamp.

[94:38.09]This is perfect.
[94:38.85]This is absolutely perfect.
[94:39.95]You guys don't think this is like a bad idea.
[94:41.49]Imagine you could just pull your car up, turn the car off and get in the bed.
[94:51.35]Alright.
[94:51.96]Does this look off?
[94:53.04]No.
[94:54.16]Got the shelf there.
[94:55.06]I need a book.
[94:55.72]Just a bookcase.

[95:04.83]Pine.
[95:06.21]No, white.
[95:09.19]I don't like the white, but I kind of have to.
[95:13.88]You tell me this ain't a cozy fucking room.
[95:19.72]And even better.
[95:21.98]Check this out.
[95:24.86]This is my son's room.
[95:27.11]Not anymore.
[95:27.85]Where's the bathroom?
[95:30.83]If you could see my face right now.
[95:32.85]I wish you could see it.
[95:35.10]Where's the bathroom?
[95:35.66]Right here?
[95:41.32]Don't want to wake up anybody?
[95:43.09]No problem.
[95:48.75]Own separate dad entrance to the bathroom.
[96:05.15]You have to move the bed a little bit Yeah, we got our own separate dad entrance So if you pull up don't even worry about it Let's go right into the bathroom take a piss come back out and go to bed Nobody even needs to know you're home
[96:34.39]That's perfect.
[96:38.97]Why don't more people do this?
[96:46.68]I need a door.
[96:47.44]Let's move the bed.
[96:52.44]Okay, now this can go...
[96:55.58]No, if this is gonna be like a dad zone, then this bed's too big.
[96:59.40]If it's just for dad, right?
[97:00.42]If dad... Ah, we're not playing darts.
[97:03.62]Right?
[97:03.96]That's what dads do.
[97:04.77]They play darts, right?
[97:08.87]No, don't look for darts.
[97:14.89]Let's see.
[97:17.59]We just need a bed.
[97:18.41]Bed.
[97:19.82]Bed.
[97:21.70]A little one.
[97:22.42]Just enough for a dad.
[97:23.64]Just enough for a dad to go to bed in there.
[97:25.88]Single bed praying mantis.
[97:28.58]This one matches.
[97:32.77]We see a single bed.
[97:36.27]Black with the flowers.
[97:37.29]No, it didn't make it navy.
[97:52.99]Nice.
[97:58.85]Okay.
[98:01.81]That's enough room to get over here.
[98:03.31]Don't need very much space.
[98:05.13]That's a race car bed.
[98:10.62]Come on.
[98:11.20]You can be young and hot, can't you?
[98:18.58]Door.
[98:22.43]Yeah, keep out.
[98:24.01]This is dad's private entrance.
[98:26.49]His biohazard entrance.
[98:28.75]Fallout shelter.
[98:30.95]That's perfect.
[98:32.55]Oh, it's perfect.
[98:33.44]There's going to be one there and one here.
[98:35.08]I love it.
[98:40.62]It's exactly what I want.
[98:44.83]So you know, this is fucking the dad zone.
[98:46.95]You ain't coming in here.
[98:51.64]It's themed.
[98:52.42]Alright, I need a wall, actually.
[99:12.24]Get cans of food.
[99:13.16]Wait, that was $900?
[99:15.82]That's too much money.
[99:22.17]But now we got... Hold on.
[99:23.37]Need tiles for the wall.
[99:29.01]Wall tile.
[99:29.73]And they were just the white ones.
[99:40.83]Gun?
[99:41.41]No.
[99:41.65]So now I have my actual private entrance.
[99:52.13]And, like, you know what?
[99:53.09]Into here... I think I want, like, my own dad entrance that goes to, like, my own dad room.
[100:00.41]Right?
[100:01.49]Like, I don't want to see my family at all.
[100:03.17]Ever.
[100:04.55]Wall this off here.
[100:05.57]Put his door over here.
[100:07.41]And, like, this, like, will be a separate dad hallway that goes into the dad study.
[100:16.69]So you never have to see dad.
[100:22.52]You know what I'm talking about?
[100:23.42]Wall.
[100:24.14]Wall.
[100:26.00]Have a door here to go into this... We'll turn this into like a bedroom.
[100:31.07]Another door here to go into this room.
[100:32.85]So if you want to come out here... Into this actual family bathroom, you can.
[100:40.97]You may as well just like separate from the family.
[100:45.84]Nah, this is a dead house.
[100:47.30]Alright.
[100:49.38]By the way, you better not use this fucking bathroom.
[100:57.53]This shit is off limits.
[101:15.26]Alright, so now I can wall this off.
[101:19.07]I'm gonna wall this off.
[101:21.69]No, no, no.
[101:21.99]Hold on.
[101:22.27]Keep this open, actually.
[101:23.23]Because if I'm going to have my own dad sanctuary... Where I don't ever have to see another person.
[101:29.25]This goes... This stays... This is going to take some of my thought.
[101:32.11]I've got to think this through.
[101:32.99]I'm making it like a Dark Souls level.
[101:35.41]Where's the dad shortcut?
[101:36.75]Okay, it's right here.
[101:37.59]Alright, so that's open.
[101:52.79]So if I wall off here, let's remove this door.
[101:58.79]Let's wall this off.
[102:04.79]What's wrong with this?
[102:07.69]Not enough room to place this wall?
[102:08.95]What are you talking about?
[102:09.59]I have to take all this.
[102:16.95]Oh, shit.
[102:17.85]It's alright.
[102:26.63]Okay, now I can wall that off.
[102:33.26]Why the fuck not?
[102:33.76]What are you talking about?
[102:34.48]There we go.
[102:35.40]What?
[102:43.44]This is giving me a hernia.
[102:45.06]Yes, wait till you see the method of my madness.
[102:47.53]You'll understand.
[103:00.14]All I'm making is a separate living space for a tenant.
[103:05.00]I thought it was out of money.
[103:20.86]Illegal subletting.
[103:29.43]Come on, build it.
[103:29.99]Alright, so here's the... So this is the dad entrance here.
[103:36.24]Secret dad entrance into the bathroom.
[103:39.22]This will lead out here.
[103:41.16]Now we gotta take care of this situation because... This just goes back to here.
[103:46.66]Hold on.
[103:47.10]Fuck, I'm making my, like, dad shortcut Dark Souls level.
[103:49.82]Wait.
[103:52.16]This is the bathroom.
[103:53.20]So this has to be walled.
[104:04.66]Dad just lives in the walls.
[104:09.46]Yeah, Dad essentially is like a pest in the house.
[104:18.64]There's a family that lives... Oh, God, I'm getting lost already.
[104:21.28]I'm actually getting lost.
[104:22.92]Wait, I forget.
[104:23.89]Where am I?
[104:24.47]Okay, hold on.
[104:25.07]This is... I need a door here.
[104:27.91]Oh, fuck.
[104:28.41]I don't... I forget what I'm doing.
[104:29.45]Okay.
[104:30.96]Where's the other rooms?
[104:32.20]Did I trap the baby?
[104:34.09]No, okay.
[104:34.57]Right here.
[104:35.13]This wall has to come down.
[104:40.57]Yeah, this wall comes down here.
[104:45.37]Where's this going to lead me to?
[104:47.14]Right here, right?
[104:50.70]Yeah, this is like the Walter White money room.
[104:52.56]We're going to change this room.
[104:54.50]This room is dumb.
[104:55.28]We're going to expand this room a little.
[105:03.69]Okay, that's good.
[105:04.59]Alright, now... So this goes out to the back.
[105:09.40]Should I have my own dad pool?
[105:11.64]Yeah, fuck this family.
[105:14.14]This is my pool.
[105:17.30]I have, like, my own back entrance to my own pool and wall it off.
[105:23.55]Yeah, dad pool 2 with cable.
[105:26.03]I'm gonna get HBO.
[105:27.97]I'm gonna get Cinemax.
[105:29.19]It's my second dad pool house.
[105:38.35]Alright, so now this leads to here.
[105:40.81]Remember, I don't want any goddamn contact with this fucking family.
[105:45.63]So this is my dad door.
[105:47.27]Oh man, this is how it is to actually make a video game level, isn't it?
[105:51.69]You work backwards.
[105:53.39]So this comes down.
[106:03.19]Come on, break.
[106:07.05]This leads into the kitchen.
[106:14.09]Hey, what are you working on, honey?
[106:16.71]Nothing, just a project.
[106:18.51]I've been trying to get to work for a long time.
[106:21.63]Oh, you're doing some renovations?
[106:23.19]Yeah.
[106:29.46]Wow, honey, you've been working on this project for like three and a half years.
[106:32.22]It's a pretty big project.
[106:36.12]Alright, so this is the front door.
[106:39.64]This is the family entrance.
[106:42.80]They come in here.
[106:43.54]Okay, I'm going to move this because this is the kid's room.
[106:46.54]Let's put that over here for now.
[106:51.35]So let's take this down.
[106:57.69]So now we don't need the... Actually, this is alright, but I'd rather have this...
[107:04.79]That's like a little family computer room.
[107:08.45]Okay, maybe I should just make it a larger room.
[107:11.00]That's what I'm gonna do.
[107:12.54]We're gonna make this, expand this room so it's bigger.
[107:14.34]Okay, so this room's gonna get a little larger.
[107:32.21]What's going on?
[107:33.25]You'll see.
[107:33.93]You will understand very shortly.
[107:39.01]Make a maze.
[107:40.77]By the way, this is not even my house.
[107:42.25]I'm building this for somebody else.
[107:46.24]Alright, so that ticks this way.
[107:47.44]Let's make this a bigger room.
[107:54.74]Should I have a couple of those dad spy holes?
[107:58.40]To see what the family's doing in the kitchen sometimes?
[108:05.68]What are they eating in there?
[108:07.60]Pot roast?
[108:08.90]Maybe they'll come out tonight.
[108:09.84]Maybe they'll come out after dark and take the pot roast out of the fridge and warm it up in the microwave.
[108:23.17]Let's move this back to here.
[108:29.54]Now this is a bigger room.
[108:38.33]Alright, this is opened up.
[108:40.35]Beautiful.
[108:40.97]Actually, I need to redo these walls.
[108:48.45]Is this a horror movie plot?
[108:50.87]No.
[108:51.87]Don't you know there's a very fine line between what is a horror movie plot and what is a comedy plot?
[108:58.66]Think about that really, really, really deeply.
[109:03.74]Is that a comedy plot?
[109:05.82]Or a horror movie plot?
[109:09.51]All of your favorite comedies, they could have been horror movies.
[109:12.93]And all your favorite horror movies could have been comedies.
[109:17.37]What's the latest scary movie craze?
[109:19.09]Oh no, the doll.
[109:21.07]The doll's alive and tries to get you.
[109:24.03]Write that into like an old relative, like an old ex-wife's mother-in-law.
[109:29.04]That like torments him and drives him crazy.
[109:32.94]That's a comedy.
[109:38.34]The hangover.
[109:41.21]What a funny movie.
[109:42.31]Three guys get lost and horrible shit happens to them.
[109:45.56]That could be a horror movie.
[109:48.04]Take away some of the jokes and add some scary shit there.
[109:50.58]That's like hostile.
[109:59.57]Alright.
[109:59.93]So now we got some shit to work with here.
[110:03.55]What is on the other side of this?
[110:06.65]Okay.
[110:07.21]This is the garage.
[110:08.11]I don't think I can make a dad zone here.
[110:10.89]Oh, fuck.
[110:11.29]I can.
[110:11.75]I can!
[110:12.13]I can make my own dad kitchen.
[110:14.21]No, I don't want my own dad kitchen.
[110:15.41]Do I?
[110:17.98]What is behind this?
[110:23.16]Okay, there can be another room here.
[110:24.54]There's my study.
[110:27.38]The dad gaming room.
[110:28.62]By the way, I'm not going to take care of the baby.
[110:30.53]Get this out of here.
[110:41.98]I'm more into the, into the making a separate secret dad house.
[110:45.62]Okay.
[110:47.60]Here's the gaming room.
[110:48.32]I'm going to have like my PC.
[110:54.69]So then this needs to be, so this is the PC gaming room.
[110:58.37]We can go one, two.
[111:02.61]Come down here.
[111:03.15]This then can turn into a, okay, I got it.
[111:05.41]I got it.
[111:06.39]The wall builder.
[111:09.80]Right here.
[111:12.54]That's good.
[111:15.12]Expand until the family lives in the pool.
[111:21.87]I do love the idea that there's a guy that just has a whole house inside of your house.
[111:28.67]And... I wonder... That would be so odd.
[111:34.45]Like, imagine if somebody built a house in a way, because obviously there are plenty of duplexes, condominiums, right, where all the houses are connected to each other, and the, essentially, oh, yeah, upstairs and downstairs.
[111:46.26]But imagine if, like, this was your bedroom, and, like, right here was, like, an elaborate set of dad tunnels, and, like, there was his, like, own, like, his bathroom or something was right here.
[111:55.86]Like, a person that you don't know.
[111:57.50]And right here is, like, your head, his ass shitting.
[112:03.36]And like over here through this hall was his room too.
[112:07.06]And it was like weirdly hallway interconnected that you would like pass through each other.
[112:11.09]Like holograms.
[112:14.19]Instead of just being connected at the top and bottom level.
[112:17.49]Or no, side to side.
[112:19.69]No, you got a guy walking through your house.
[112:22.57]Inside of your house.
[112:29.82]What, you don't get it?
[112:30.60]What, you don't get it?
[112:38.35]What are you on?
[112:38.95]I'm not on anything.
[112:45.03]Stop.
[112:46.21]Okay, so this is... This now can come over here.
[112:49.53]Because this is the kitchen.
[112:51.45]This is the living room.
[112:54.31]So this bed right here.
[112:55.53]This bedroom here.
[113:07.69]I hope Etalyx checks the house for dad tunnels.
[113:11.63]That's the thing.
[113:12.21]A great dad architect.
[113:15.91]You'll never fucking know the difference.
[113:22.02]Those of us in the chat here... You know... This is now a horror movie.
[113:32.72]No, or it's a comedy.
[113:35.25]Have you ever seen Mrs. Doubtfire?
[113:39.01]Okay.
[113:39.55]Now, imagine if Mrs. Doubtfire, instead of, I want to get back with my family, I'm going to dress up as, like, an old lady and be their nanny, it's, I'm going to build a house in their house and, like, listen to them and try to talk to them through the walls and stuff.
[113:53.83]Wall dad!
[113:56.28]Or like, Dad's in the house!
[113:57.70]And like, the poster could be, you know, Dad has got like a dirty face with a bunch of tools all over him.
[114:03.85]With like a hard hat on.
[114:05.43]And he's got like, he's grabbing like one of the kids behind him by the hand like, oh!
[114:09.55]And in between them is like a broken wall.
[114:11.74]And like the mom is like on the phone like with the police like shaking her finger.
[114:23.17]Just replace me dressing up like an old lady with I'm hiding in the walls.
[114:28.63]And just keep the same movie plot.
[114:30.41]The same plot can stay intact.
[114:51.84]alright so now we got this room here that leads into the computer room and little do you know I'm up till like two in the morning playing fortnight and what's that oh like little tommy's gotta go to school tomorrow get fucked over noobs what are you gonna do about that like slam a coffee and he's in there just like sleeping
[115:22.42]-2, what do you mean, for Fortnite?
[115:23.88]Because I said the word Fortnite.
[115:28.08]Yeah, and like, there could be the trailer where like, I hear something in the walls.
[115:33.39]Like, Sturminator comes, and like, Dad's like in the walls, like dodging the spray, like the spray nozzle, bang, goes through the wall, and it's like just close to his face, and he's like, whoa!
[115:49.40]He's like dodging, and like dipping his head down,
[115:52.56]Yes, ma'am.
[115:53.10]I'm not sure.
[115:53.62]It sounds like you might have a gigantic marsupial in that wall.
[116:05.13]And then eventually one of the kids finds out that dad has built this whole fucking thing inside the house.
[116:12.50]And he keeps the secret, but it's hard.
[116:14.40]Because, oh boy, dad had to go to the kitchen for a minute and he snuck out of his house, out of his little door.
[116:20.48]And the little boy has to distract the mom with all kinds of funny faces and act weird so dad can get some chicken from the fridge.
[116:39.12]They would never notice their whole house was changed.
[116:40.99]Well, I know.
[116:41.41]This is all total horseshit.
[116:44.15]I'm glad you're figuring that out.
[116:48.81]I only get points.
[116:51.37]Faster building.
[116:56.30]Can build three walls.
[116:57.60]Why can't I do this now?
[117:01.02]Built walls already painted?
[117:02.18]Just faster building.
[117:05.29]It's a lot bigger.
[117:06.63]Okay.
[117:06.75]Okay.
[117:08.48]So now let's get this closed off here.
[117:10.96]That's because I need to hold shift, don't I?
[117:14.73]Control?
[117:15.11]What is it?
[117:17.37]Alt?
[117:17.97]I know it's something weird.
[117:19.79]Tab?
[117:20.25]No.
[117:21.21]How do I build more than one?
[117:25.39]Q?
[117:27.15]It's something strange.
[117:27.97]It's like R or T or... Alt F4.
[117:46.78]I like your pitch, but what if you change the dad to like a weird hobo?
[117:49.86]Yeah, but how does the hobo have like a connection to the family?
[118:06.34]He's the dad.
[118:07.00]No, but how would he build the whole thing?
[118:11.26]The whole joke with, like, the family doesn't know is dad's been working on a project for a long time, and then, like, there's a big problem between dad and the wife.
[118:26.76]Oh, actually, let me address this while there's enough people here.
[118:29.12]While we're just hanging out.
[118:31.38]So, the emote contest is getting pushed to not today, because I just didn't have enough time to get everything I wanted.
[118:40.88]All the bullshit that happened with the water damage and all that stupid shit had to be taken care of.
[118:46.36]Still ongoingly being taken care of.
[118:52.86]So it's not ready yet.
[118:55.32]The plan is that on Friday there's going to be a stream on Friday and Saturday.
[119:01.28]We'll do the emote contest on Friday and then we'll stream again on Saturday.
[119:07.13]No emote contest tonight.
[119:08.77]I'm sorry.
[119:09.47]It was not ready.
[119:11.35]By the way, I forgot where everything was.
[119:14.55]I just, I'm an idiot.
[119:18.13]Pretty sure this is the dad room, right?
[119:22.83]The emote's gonna be all dried out by then.
[119:24.75]Alright, here's this room, that's good.
[119:29.62]No, this is the kit.
[119:34.68]Fuck, I did it wrong.
[119:37.58]Goddammit, this is incorrect.
[119:42.90]I should have planned that better.
[119:45.58]This is just the second... Okay, yep.
[119:49.12]Yeah, this needs to be sealed.
[119:51.46]Because then right here is that kid's room.
[119:58.99]I'll clean it up.
[119:59.47]I'll fix it.
[120:04.03]And I want to make it so it's so close to this room, but it's just not at all, you know?
[120:10.81]How much am I going to sell this place for, I wonder?
[120:12.56]Okay, that's enough for a door, right?
[120:22.44]Is that going to... Get out of here!
[120:23.54]Okay.
[120:25.12]So we patched this one up.
[120:32.11]Okay.
[120:33.57]Door.
[120:33.71]Door.
[120:41.64]Uh, what are they all?
[120:42.54]Oh, it's like brown one, yeah.
[120:46.68]Alright, so that's this one.
[120:48.24]It's only enough for like a bed in here.
[120:52.16]And maybe a light.
[120:53.58]That's fine.
[120:55.38]And this has to be closed again.
[120:58.42]Get a door right here.
[121:02.85]All the dad doors, so I can know exactly where they are, have to have...
[121:10.41]you know what yeah the bio has the doors so I can just I can differentiate which is actually a door for the other house he's gonna have no windows he'll have a window to the kitchen we'll knock out like some of it so no then he won't have any privacy that's not gonna work uh oh wait a minute oh this is not good
[121:41.74]This is not good at all.
[121:42.72]This has to be the dad room.
[121:44.92]Because there's windows here.
[121:45.72]They could see what was going on.
[121:48.40]Uh-oh.
[121:50.30]This might be a botch.
[121:56.57]No, it's got to be right here.
[122:03.71]Let's take out the windows.
[122:06.30]I don't think you can.
[122:08.26]Because you did... I didn't build this house.
[122:10.20]You have to just touch it up.
[122:17.07]Okay, yeah, so I have to have the smaller room here.
[122:18.81]That's fine.
[122:20.61]I keep saying I for some reason.
[122:22.15]Like, it's mine.
[122:22.65]I don't know why.
[122:23.19]Alright, so then this is... This has to go.
[122:29.34]Let's change the rooms.
[122:33.64]Wall that off.
[122:37.68]Okay.
[122:42.24]Just give me a regular door.
[122:50.16]That makes more sense.
[122:58.07]No way to tell.
[123:00.41]Shit.
[123:01.15]That's not gonna work.
[123:02.03]I need to break the rest of this.
[123:10.82]Okay, let's put this in here.
[123:15.50]Come on, go away.
[123:16.14]Why do you have to stay here?
[123:21.83]The door, they just melt eventually.
[123:23.71]Alright, that's better.
[123:28.28]Yes, I'm aware I'm spending way too much time on this, but sometimes you have to.
[123:36.80]Dad never runs out of money.
[123:38.28]Yeah, he made the right investments.
[123:44.25]He got lucky on a big investment.
[123:46.13]Okay.
[123:53.29]So this has to go now.
[123:59.29]I can't build it like this.
[124:09.52]What if a single person wanted to buy this house?
[124:12.18]Well, then you would sell the other one to somebody else and tell them it was their own house and nobody else lived there.
[124:18.69]What's with the other entrance on the other side?
[124:20.33]Ah, rats, bugs.
[124:35.55]Okay.
[124:37.29]That's better.
[124:38.11]So now, look at the window you got there.
[124:43.41]Now this gets sealed up.
[124:47.69]I think the plan has pretty much worked out then.
[124:53.66]That's what you call a duplex?
[124:54.80]Yeah, but no duplex is built like this.
[124:58.92]Like, right now, this is a bedroom right here.
[125:01.82]Think about that, right?
[125:02.50]So...
[125:03.77]When you buy a duplex... This is... Oh, this is my kitchen right here.
[125:07.79]Okay.
[125:09.21]Here's somebody's bedroom.
[125:11.33]Here's my bedroom.
[125:13.79]That's... No, they're never made like that.
[125:17.78]This is... This is encroachment here.
[125:23.46]A family of five want the house.
[125:28.72]Oh, he gets it.
[125:29.47]Dad already gets it.
[125:30.47]He already knows.
[125:34.06]He's like, holy shit, I should live in a dead sanctuary.
[125:36.96]I'm like, I'm going to take that one.
[125:40.55]So now this leads up to the backyard.
[125:43.51]They need a bathroom, though.
[125:44.53]Alright, I need to think this through.
[125:47.41]Now they have entrance.
[125:50.11]A little bedroom.
[125:53.05]They have their own way to go to the back.
[125:54.97]So this is the backyard.
[125:56.11]Kitchen.
[125:57.19]Kitchen.
[125:59.78]And then down here is Dad's entrance.
[126:03.34]Dad's exit.
[126:04.08]We're going to wall this off here.
[126:05.92]Or right here.
[126:11.18]Looks good.
[126:21.93]There's a method to the madness.
[126:22.99]It's already over.
[126:23.61]You can already see it.
[126:24.47]It's already done.
[126:25.11]This is complete now.
[126:33.40]Dad takes up almost all the space in the house.
[126:36.66]A family of four have to sleep in one bedroom.
[126:45.03]Well, at least they wait.
[126:45.87]Hold on a minute.
[126:46.49]They have the big living room and a kitchen.
[126:49.77]I don't.
[126:50.11]I have a garage bedroom.
[126:55.56]And that's it.
[126:59.52]Yeah, I'm gonna have a sick computer room, but, like, that's it.
[127:04.42]That's not... That's not that cool.
[127:18.05]You have... Wait, what?
[127:21.84]My family doesn't have a bathroom?
[127:24.30]Wait, the family... This they do?
[127:27.68]Oh, shit.
[127:28.06]Wait, now I can't even get over there.
[127:34.06]This is the better... Oh, god damn it.
[127:37.90]Oh, how do I fix this?
[127:38.88]I have both bathrooms.
[127:51.77]Okay.
[127:54.15]Here's one... Oh, this is my bathroom here.
[127:56.41]So, where's their bathroom?
[128:02.32]No, I can fix this.
[128:02.96]Okay, so here we go.
[128:14.04]Alright, I got the back entrance here.
[128:15.74]I don't think I can build out here.
[128:17.24]I don't think I can make a wall over here and wall off the... Can I?
[128:23.49]Get out of here.
[128:27.13]Alright, that's fine.
[128:27.87]Now that I have a bathroom.
[128:35.20]Two bed, two bath, or one bed, one dad?
[128:37.92]That's a good question.
[128:43.35]Uh, here.
[128:50.81]Problem solved.
[128:53.06]At least in my opinion.
[128:54.44]That is a problem that has been solved.
[128:58.24]Now we just wall off the other side.
[129:05.70]You can build a basement now?
[129:08.14]You can?
[129:08.54]How the hell do you do that?
[129:15.03]Is there a way I can go down?
[129:16.35]Let me see if this is all correct.
[129:23.84]Alright, this wall, get this walled off.
[129:31.45]I need a jackhammer?
[129:32.47]I don't have that yet.
[129:40.98]Oh, fuck.
[129:41.22]They don't have a bathroom.
[129:42.04]They have just two sinks in here.
[129:44.12]Okay, they can piss in that sink and they can shit in that one.
[129:46.80]Just remove the drain from that one.
[129:48.74]And then they can just go right down.
[129:54.57]Build a house now inside of dad's house.
[129:56.47]That's not possible.
[130:04.56]Okay.
[130:06.54]That looks good.
[130:07.98]Let's just do a trial walkthrough here to make sure.
[130:09.88]I need more lights.
[130:14.37]Entrance 1, entrance 2.
[130:16.73]Entrance 1.
[130:19.40]My bedroom.
[130:20.18]My car.
[130:22.04]Bathroom.
[130:23.98]Hallway.
[130:27.02]Another big hall.
[130:31.34]Into the pool.
[130:32.17]Okay.
[130:32.29]Okay.
[130:34.26]This can be, like, a study or a second bedroom in case I want to have some friends over or have, like, a family over or something.
[130:41.48]And now, of course, I'm not talking about the family that's here.
[130:43.33]I'm talking about somebody else.
[130:46.01]There's a window there.
[130:46.73]It's alright, though.
[130:48.31]Can fix it.
[130:50.77]Um... This leads... Where does this go?
[130:54.53]This is another room.
[130:56.15]That's the computer room.
[130:59.38]I gotta clean this up.
[131:00.90]So then they come this way.
[131:02.72]This is their entrance here.
[131:05.62]Like the living room.
[131:08.52]Bedroom.
[131:10.76]Into their kitchen.
[131:11.92]Back door.
[131:13.46]Bathroom.
[131:14.79]Alright.
[131:16.17]Let's do it.
[131:19.15]Let's start with the computer room because that's obviously in the bottom of my heart.
[131:27.54]Here, okay, let's get some lights in here.
[131:32.03]Looking for home electronics, installations, light switch.
[131:42.44]Okay, oh shit, now we gotta fix that.
[131:52.73]I can't run prototype.
[131:59.23]Dad doesn't need doors if it's only Dad in it, but he gets to have fun with his Fallout doors.
[132:05.49]That's his favorite game.
[132:06.59]Oh, watch out!
[132:07.81]Go into the chamber!
[132:08.71]I need to go into the disinfecting chamber before I go into my computer room!
[132:14.08]You know, Dad's a tool.
[132:15.42]Dad's a loser.
[132:18.48]He's gonna put... I'm gonna put fake, like, spray up here and shit.
[132:21.16]Like, oh, I gotta get my hazmat suit.
[132:31.39]Larving dad.
[132:33.33]Dad's panic room.
[132:34.42]Alright.
[132:36.46]I need lights.
[132:39.54]Perfectly on the ceiling.
[132:44.86]Fluorescent light.
[132:48.04]No, I want better ones.
[132:51.72]Ceiling lamps.
[132:53.77]Halogen.
[132:56.85]Halogen's not... That's fine.
[133:10.10]Perfect.
[133:11.52]Wait.
[133:12.44]This one's not centered.
[133:20.07]Is this my house?
[133:21.71]No, it's not.
[133:23.67]Why is it not centered?
[133:24.63]Stop it.
[133:25.57]Get it right.
[133:26.05]Shit.
[133:30.40]Shit.
[133:40.93]Okay I can just click on paint
[134:14.07]Bright orange computer room.
[134:20.21]I'm alright with it.
[134:20.97]It's good.
[134:21.67]Nice and bright.
[134:36.38]Get it on there.
[134:39.62]Skill points?
[134:41.44]I got skill points.
[134:44.05]I thought I said I had a skill point.
[134:44.95]Yeah, I do.
[134:46.49]Alright, demolition.
[134:48.07]Faster demolition.
[134:49.76]Big professional hammer.
[134:50.96]More muscle strength.
[134:53.64]Faster demolition, probably, I would say.
[134:55.14]It's probably the best thing to do.
[134:59.96]I'm getting claustrophobic in this room.
[135:02.26]And there's not even any furniture in here.
[135:06.60]$50!
[135:06.68]$50 from CookieCR.
[135:07.64]And thank you, Cookie, for the $50, man.
[135:12.16]Much appreciated, dude.
[135:14.44]And what do you say?
[135:15.30]You say... Go away.
[135:17.94]Go away?
[135:20.28]What do you mean, go away?
[135:23.38]Why are you saying that?
[135:27.29]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[135:31.31]Going right into the computer room.
[135:36.89]Go away to Vegas?

[135:39.66]Very soon.
[135:42.35]Alright, this is done.
[135:42.99]Let's make sure I got everything I did.
[135:46.97]Oh, I like how those... I kind of like this.
[135:48.97]I kind of want this for my room.
[135:54.10]Now we need a computer desk.
[135:55.56]Now I need a new floor here.
[135:57.36]This floor sucks.

[136:18.65]Oh, yep.
[136:33.00]Come on.
[136:39.91]It needs to be under there.
[136:45.57]Alright, that's good.
[136:53.50]Alright, what portal level did I make?
[136:55.24]Why does it look off?
[136:58.86]Alright, now we need a desk.
[137:07.57]Standard desk.
[137:09.15]This one looks alright.
[137:11.81]Classic desk.
[137:12.75]Standard desk.
[137:13.99]I don't like the way that looks, though.
[137:15.09]How about... I guess that does kind of match, though.
[137:20.56]Steel?
[137:32.23]No, this is not going to fit in here.
[137:37.28]It's not gonna fit in here, guys.

[145:05.87]Yeah, this is... This is how... It's like the police are in this room.
[145:11.34]In their secret room, right next to, like, the actual room.
[145:15.68]Hey, sure, you gotta catch him saying he's gonna sell the drugs.
[145:23.17]Okay.
[145:24.57]What's next?
[145:30.46]I get to make a bathroom.
[145:31.74]I'm not going to have any more money.
[145:34.68]This joke, I think, is exhausting.
[145:36.42]I don't have any more money.
[145:40.88]Mountable toilet?
[145:43.46]Okay.
[145:47.09]Oh, God.
[145:47.89]Come on.
[145:51.93]Why is it right here?
[145:53.27]Why would the toilet be right here?
[145:54.71]What are you doing?
[145:55.97]I can't move this?
[146:09.20]It's the step over the toilet.
[146:13.03]God damn it.
[146:14.95]I can't turn it.
[146:18.91]That is lost money.
[146:24.49]Stay over there.
[146:27.50]Why won't you let me do this?
[146:35.04]Where am I assembling this?
[146:50.52]Just move the door slightly.
[146:51.98]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[146:53.02]But no, I can't.
[146:54.81]This is a shower?
[147:02.45]I can't move it over because the shower is supposed to go here.
[147:11.66]Okay, well... Mountable shower.
[147:20.34]Oh no.
[147:34.27]I might have to redo some things here.
[147:37.05]I don't need to shower?
[147:37.79]Yeah, I do.
[147:39.77]What about a bathtub?
[147:41.81]Nah, fuck this.
[147:42.45]Get me out of here.
[147:42.93]Bathtub.
[147:44.95]Towel radiator.
[147:46.66]Sink.
[147:49.90]Hold on.
[148:02.13]Oh, fuck you, game.
[148:04.73]Sink.
[148:07.43]That's it?
[148:08.17]That has to be a shower?
[148:24.27]Whatever.
[148:24.57]I can just move the door.
[148:31.64]Does he use the sink?
[148:33.56]I want to be clean.
[148:34.30]I don't want to be dirty.
[148:40.20]I forgot how long the shower takes to make.
[148:56.70]Nice.
[148:56.98]I like the sound.
[148:57.92]They sound nice.
[149:10.41]Okay.
[149:12.01]Last little piece here.
[149:12.99]Screw these in.
[149:20.39]I can't afford anything else with the rest of the family.
[149:23.41]Dad's got to have his nice shower.
[149:29.74]The sound effects are really nice.
[149:31.88]It's a very relaxing game.
[149:33.68]That's for sure.
[149:44.46]Top on, man.
[149:57.33]There is no top.
[149:59.55]There's no ventilation.
[150:00.55]Okay, there is a window right there.
[150:06.12]Alright, close it up.
[150:11.92]Done.
[150:15.47]I actually think I can still get out.
[150:18.47]No, this is fine.
[150:21.81]That's alright.
[150:22.21]Let's go put the sink in.
[150:44.60]assemble stick it on there spin it down do it again I didn't connect these though can I leave them unconnected no
[151:14.77]uh this bathroom sucks well it's also a secret bathroom so you know get on there attach
[151:44.23]I'm doing it so wrong.
[151:49.23]Alright.
[151:51.20]Towel warmer.
[151:57.02]Don't need this.
[151:57.68]Alright.
[152:02.77]Towel warmer.
[152:05.95]Let's get that built.
[152:13.25]This house is going to go for a lot of money, though.
[152:14.65]It just has to.
[152:15.45]Look at how many extra rooms I've built.
[152:16.95]Look at how many things I'm installing.
[152:18.13]$5?
[152:18.15]No.
[152:28.44]More like $500,000.
[152:28.96]That's it for here.
[152:29.88]Got a good light.
[152:44.67]Shit.
[152:45.12]It's alright.
[152:48.42]I need to match this tile, though.
[152:53.38]There's wall tiles.
[152:55.10]Where is it?
[152:57.23]It's a weird blue.
[152:59.11]Light blue.
[153:00.51]That's not it right there, is it?
[153:04.19]Light blue rectangles.
[153:05.35]Is this it?
[153:07.69]Close enough.
[153:10.78]Yeah, that's it.
[153:13.87]Get a TV in the bathroom?
[153:16.09]That's not a bad idea.
[153:25.56]Right under the towel warmer?
[153:28.44]I think that makes sense.
[153:33.67]You know, what an awesome thing to have.
[153:35.13]I wish I had a TV in my bathroom.
[153:39.59]You know, I'll give you a quick little story.
[153:42.29]I love spending time in the bathroom.
[153:45.93]I used to... Remember, this is before... There was ever such thing as... Well, you know, a tablet, an iPhone.
[153:55.11]That didn't exist back when I was 12 years old.
[153:58.55]It just didn't.
[154:00.80]So what I would do is I would bring my whole computer into the bathroom.
[154:06.00]Remember, there's no laptops.
[154:09.17]I would bring the tower, the monitor, keyboard and mouse into the bathroom and sit at the toilet like it was a desk.
[154:22.31]That is not a lie, I swear to God.
[154:28.61]Am I insane?
[154:29.67]No, I- I- I- What was I supposed to do?
[154:32.42]A lot of you guys don't remember.
[154:35.22]These fucking things didn't exist.
[154:38.49]I know a lot of you guys sit on that can with your phone or an iPad in your hands or a Kindle Fire and you sit there for two hours playing Clash Royale.
[154:50.71]I couldn't do that.
[154:52.57]I had to bring my whole computer into the bathroom and play Diablo II or Diablo 1.
[155:10.94]Two hours?
[155:13.34]You guys don't do that?
[155:14.26]Sometimes you spend like 30 or 40 minutes just contemplating with the world around you.
[155:20.54]And you spend like 30 minutes just hanging out, thinking.
[155:25.99]And then like 40 minutes like playing a video game or reading something.
[155:29.59]Here we go.
[155:36.63]Painting.
[155:37.07]This is what I want.
[155:41.00]Less paint.
[155:44.12]Game Boy 2.
[155:44.80]Yeah, but Game Boy sucked.
[155:50.08]You guys don't know how good you have it.
[155:54.37]Yeah, I could bring the original clunky-ass Game Boy in there.
[155:59.67]Well, that was fun.
[156:01.51]Needing to have a desk lamp beaming onto the front of that screen to see it after 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[156:10.20]There was no backlighting.
[156:11.40]There was no LCD screens.
[156:13.34]That thing was made out of, like, wood.
[156:20.06]The original Game Boy was made out of wood.
[156:24.55]I need to clean this.
[156:36.08]I like this room.
[156:37.46]This room's fine.
[156:38.84]Bathroom's done.
[156:39.54]Bathroom's done and clean, right?
[156:43.12]Ah, wait a second here.
[156:44.94]That's disgusting.
[156:47.06]Something better than that.
[156:47.81]Let's do ceiling lamps.
[156:55.61]Cube.
[156:57.21]Make it brass.
[156:57.93]Uh-huh.
[157:05.68]I mean steel.
[157:13.63]Do I have a light in here?
[157:14.53]Like a switch?
[157:16.33]I don't.
[157:16.67]Okay, good.
[157:31.72]What is in here?
[157:35.62]okay I was like when did I do that that's a secret entrance secret what am I gonna teleport am I gonna open that and go down into the lair okay oh I need to fix that wall panels please a wall tiles which one is the white ones
[158:05.18]I think back though at just how... At just how the world has changed so rapidly and dramatically since I was 15 years old, 12 years old.
[158:23.98]Like twitch.tv, youtube.com?
[158:27.80]Playing online with your friends?
[158:30.78]Huh?
[158:32.10]What?
[158:32.92]What are you talking about?
[158:35.42]When I was like 15 or 16, guys, if somebody called the house, the computer would crash.
[158:45.06]And if I was playing a game online, like I used to play Command and Conquer Red Alert all the time, me and my brother.
[158:51.06]Somebody fucking calls the house?
[158:53.83]Oh, sorry, you can't play your video game anymore.
[158:55.85]Somebody picks up the phone, then you get that robot language that would be in your ear.
[159:00.07]Oh, sorry, oh, I picked up the phone.
[159:02.21]You can't do anything.
[159:12.63]Midlife crisis.
[159:13.57]No, that was the way it was!
[159:14.57]Alright, that looks good.
[159:22.71]No outlets, but who gives a shit?
[159:24.21]They'll figure it out when they buy it.
[159:25.49]Let's paint this a better color.
[159:27.65]What do you say?
[159:29.19]Gotta have like a fucking plant in here or something, right?
[159:38.28]Give me a plant.
[159:44.18]Uh, what?
[159:46.98]No, I don't like a canteen.
[159:48.36]These are all too small.
[160:20.96]I can't... Get in there.
[160:27.60]I can't put that in there.
[160:28.58]Alright, what about this one?
[160:35.32]Um... Can I put anything in here?
[160:48.93]Oh come on!
[160:50.51]Really?
[160:50.83]What's the point of having this open?
[161:01.80]Oh, here we go.
[161:02.68]This is important.
[161:03.30]That's very important.
[161:17.79]uh switch shovel knife canister pickled cucumbers a generator food large food container yep that's fine
[161:42.36]And a box of something in it.
[161:45.18]Whatever it is.
[161:47.14]My supplies.
[161:47.70]I need a generator to power the computer.
[161:54.28]I can't afford it.
[161:55.83]I can't afford a generator.
[162:00.93]Turbine power generator.
[162:08.31]This is all my... I don't have any more money.
[162:16.68]Yeah, I can't use the family's electricity.
[162:23.15]There goes all the money.
[162:24.59]I have 200 bucks.
[162:28.67]Doing an IRL setup.
[162:31.01]Do I even have enough paint?
[162:35.23]Oh no, this is not good.
[162:38.39]Well, how do I take care of this?
[162:39.55]What do I do about this?
[162:40.19]I have to start selling all this stuff.
[162:42.87]Can I sell the pool?
[162:47.88]Come on.
[162:48.36]I can't sell this.
[162:51.96]The pool's made out of glass, apparently.
[162:53.58]Okay, I can't sell the pool.
[163:00.11]Shit.
[163:02.71]Anything really expensive in this house?
[163:14.02]What happens if I leave this house?
[163:18.91]Can I leave?
[163:19.99]And will this stay the same?
[163:29.34]Okay, it saves, right?
[163:33.18]Do you want to return?
[163:33.82]Your progress will be automatically saved.
[163:37.32]Okay, so that's fine.
[163:40.87]I'm afraid to drink out of this cup.
[163:41.99]I don't know what's in here.
[163:45.53]Let's do a mission.
[163:53.11]A garage.
[163:54.53]Aunt's home garage.
[163:55.87]What's this one?
[163:57.53]I bought a new car, but there's so much trash that I can't fit it into my garage.
[164:01.49]Can you please clean out my garage?
[164:04.09]So I have somewhere to park.
[164:05.55]We talked about this.
[164:07.27]Look at this.
[164:07.69]This is exactly what I was describing.
[164:11.55]Look at this shit.
[164:12.75]I told you guys.
[164:18.26]Oh yeah, I love good garage, right?
[164:20.68]Where do I get that picture?
[164:21.82]Where do I get this one?
[164:24.12]How do I take this?
[164:25.62]This is exactly what I wanted.
[164:26.95]That was supposed to be in like the dad zone.
[164:46.23]I can't sell the car.
[164:53.53]Clean up the trash.
[164:54.41]Just do the trash first.
[165:05.26]Steal me to put in somebody else's house.
[165:11.14]Hey, he did tell me to clean out the garage.
[165:17.00]So that means everything in here is trash.
[165:21.93]Your car sucks.
[165:24.20]Like, I'm not being mean, I'm just speaking honestly here.
[165:32.70]We're so worried about your dirty garage, how about your dirty car?
[165:35.48]Alright, get off of the... more junk.
[165:42.65]Please take the damn thing to a car wash, man.
[165:51.91]Alright.
[165:53.61]That it for the junk.
[165:54.43]Now let's do a couple things here.
[165:55.57]Alright.
[166:01.61]Let's start the clean.
[166:02.63]Am I turning his car on?
[166:16.10]Just start from the back here.
[166:22.14]Already $2,500.
[166:22.40]See, look at this poster.
[166:29.80]That's exactly the dumb dad man cave poster I was talking about.
[166:46.01]Wait a minute.
[166:56.41]Okay, hold on.
[166:56.91]Okay, photo saved.
[167:08.63]A little bit closer, maybe?
[167:14.96]That's fine.
[167:16.28]Okay, we got it now.
[167:20.48]Hey, dumb man cave.
[167:21.72]Nice dumb man cave story, you dumb man cave man.
[167:27.61]Got a bunch of trash in the backyard.
[167:34.19]This is so funny.
[167:34.81]Hold on.
[167:37.19]Again.
[167:37.43]And I hate to be right here.
[167:40.34]I hate to be right.
[167:40.96]I don't want to be right.
[167:43.14]Tools.
[167:43.44]Yeah, tools I don't use.
[167:45.80]Yeah, I'm going to have a tool, a bunch of saws and shit.
[167:50.28]Yeah.
[167:50.60]Okay, I knew it.
[167:54.43]I'm telling you.
[167:59.30]There are bugs back here.
[168:04.99]How did I know this mission was going to be a dad mission?
[168:08.61]No, this is this dad.
[168:09.35]This is not a true.
[168:10.11]This is like just, come on, man.
[168:12.43]If this was a real dad, he would have respect for his space.
[168:17.31]And it would be, he'd have like a computer here.
[168:20.25]He'd be playing Quake on it.
[168:23.27]This is not, please.
[168:24.25]Please.
[168:33.90]That didn't even have Quake 2.
[168:35.84]He's got... Cool.
[168:37.66]You've got tools.
[168:41.50]What happened to this?
[168:42.22]Why did I just do that?
[168:56.66]50s.
[168:56.78]Buy so much money.
[168:57.74]Imagine paying somebody like 10 grand to come pick up the trash in your garage.
[169:06.03]Like, this job is probably like an hour and 45 minutes right here.
[169:11.21]It's not even that bad.
[169:12.11]There's just boxes.
[169:31.12]I need those later.
[169:35.67]More shit back here that I can't reach.
[169:37.65]Yeah, I can.
[169:40.25]I can reach it.
[169:40.97]That corner's good.
[169:46.05]Yes, it is.
[169:46.51]A little bit more on the side.
[169:56.38]This is clean.
[169:57.50]Clean, clean, clean.
[169:58.56]Okay.
[169:59.74]That's it.
[170:03.14]How's your car?
[170:03.70]Are you car clean yet?
[170:07.54]Almost.
[170:12.34]Still some boxes to get rid of.
[170:13.74]That's it for that.
[170:17.36]Window needs to be cleaned.
[170:20.60]Squeegee it.
[170:24.96]It really is so ridiculous.
[170:26.14]This game, I don't know why.
[170:28.34]This is a good game.
[170:34.18]For some strange reason.
[170:35.81]It just is.
[170:41.49]I just really wish you could build your own house.
[170:48.20]Because I don't think in this current state the game is in that you can just build your own house.
[170:57.10]What's this last box?
[171:05.50]You can?
[171:06.08]I thought... You can improve your office.
[171:11.76]Oh, there it is.
[171:12.24]Okay, I'm blind.
[171:13.90]Where's the last piece of dirt?
[171:22.27]A little bit more dirt outside.
[171:26.97]Corner here.
[171:30.41]Oh, it's almost done.
[171:34.70]Got it.
[171:34.92]100%.
[171:35.18]Oh, there's still some dirt.
[171:38.82]Where is it?
[171:40.56]Where's the last 2% of dirt?
[171:42.26]I don't see it on the minimap.
[171:47.88]No.
[171:48.68]This is going to drive me insane.
[171:52.16]I can't sell the car.
[171:53.02]I can pick it up.
[172:08.78]Alright, where is it?
[172:10.48]Where is this last piece of dirt?
[172:11.78]99%.
[172:11.80]Ugh.
[172:12.44]Ugh.
[172:40.80]No!
[172:41.44]99.
[172:41.46]We can't do this without 100%.
[172:58.93]I won't be able to go to bed tonight.
[173:15.73]Got it.
[173:16.85]Alright.
[173:20.25]Alright, that's done.
[173:28.24]$8,400.
[173:28.26]$8,600.
[173:28.28]Now we can go back and do what we were doing.
[173:31.60]So... Use.
[173:35.12]Now I can go to browser and... This is where... Yeah.
[173:40.35]Huckster's House.
[173:46.30]Alright, go to the house.
[173:54.22]This ain't gonna be like this, right?
[174:04.73]No, it's taking a long time to load, therefore, yeah, of course.
[174:08.29]No pizza, that means.
[174:09.05]Fucking kids.
[174:13.14]Punk kids.
[174:15.43]vandalizing my property.
[174:16.71]Alright, so we left off.
[174:21.99]I was going to... I like it clean.
[174:26.33]Yes, you do.
[174:28.05]Don't we all?
[174:28.59]Alright, I got some radiators to mount.
[174:35.33]I don't want to clean this.
[174:38.47]I mean, this is really dirty.
[174:39.53]Can I just clean it or do I need a new one?
[174:43.50]Yeah, this thing's run down.
[174:44.40]This thing's got to go.
[174:47.74]What about the windows?
[174:48.26]Are the windows like that too?
[174:50.34]Nah, that one's new.
[174:54.33]These ones are fine.
[174:59.19]You can set it as your office?
[175:00.77]Well, I'm going to sell it.
[175:02.17]I'm going to flip this thing for like 400 grand.
[175:06.79]Alright, let's paint this not this dumb color.
[175:10.59]Actually, no, no, no.
[175:11.71]I need my dad posters up here.
[175:23.31]This one's better.
[175:45.63]I can't fit it anywhere.
[175:48.13]It doesn't fit anywhere.
[175:52.33]$6,000 dad poster.
[175:54.16]It won't fit anywhere in this whole house.
[175:56.68]It's not possible.
[175:58.42]No, this ain't gonna happen Come on, really?
[176:09.78]Can I put it on the ceiling?
[176:15.08]Wait
[176:21.40]In the big family room.
[176:23.76]I have to go out.
[176:24.80]Hold on a second.
[176:28.79]This is just wallpaper at this point.
[176:34.05]Put it on the garage door.
[176:36.75]It's not gonna fit.
[176:37.39]This is way too big.
[176:46.74]Make it smaller.
[177:00.83]Oh, you dick!
[177:22.47]Alright, this is just the thing that follows a plane to advertise a fucking furniture store.
[177:37.91]What's wrong with that?
[177:41.23]What is wrong with that?
[177:42.13]That would fit perfectly.
[177:51.56]This is starting to anger me.
[177:53.36]This is not fair.
[178:02.32]It's going to have to just be this whole wall.
[178:08.60]Here we go.
[178:09.02]Got it.
[178:12.90]Oh, that was like fucking $2,000.
[178:13.94]Oh, no!
[178:23.55]It should have been longer.
[178:25.22]Oh!
[179:23.98]No, I'm not, I gotta, I have to, this is perfect.
[179:28.70]This is exactly, you know, like, you got, you got, like, the, the image of the, the, you got, like, the David Bowie poster, right?
[179:35.51]You got, like, the sexy lady, whatever it is.
[179:39.89]You got the beach photo.
[179:41.07]This is perfect.
[179:51.90]Okay.
[179:52.68]Whoever moves in here is going to love this place.
[179:54.31]Now I need... I need to... I need quiet.
[180:03.36]I need silence so I can think.
[180:05.52]Quiet.
[180:06.41]Everybody quiet.
[180:26.15]Damn it.
[180:31.81]You can't do it.
[180:32.39]Never mind.
[180:38.27]Paint.
[180:38.55]Alright, you guys can... The silence is off.
[180:43.86]Let's go with a nice little... Let's go with some... Let's go with a little bit of... Let's go with some...
[180:55.42]Let's go with some mmm.
[180:57.90]That's too dark.
[180:58.80]Mmm.
[181:00.34]Let's go with a little bit of mmm.
[181:02.12]How about some cocoa?
[181:06.96]That's a Swiffer.
[181:07.56]That's not a paintbrush.
[181:22.47]Mix the paint by hand.
[181:26.54]If I ever saw anybody do that, and they weren't fucking around, I think I might lose my mind.
[181:32.68]I might have laughed harder than I've ever laughed.
[181:41.37]Paint lasts a lot longer, that's good.
[181:48.43]Don't zen breathe on the toilet?
[181:52.39]What?
[181:54.38]What do you mean, don't zen breathe on the toilet?
[181:56.08]Why would I breathe on the toilet?
[182:01.94]If you're breathing on your toilet, I feel like you had a night out.
[182:06.23]And you didn't do so well.
[182:10.67]You had too many shots of Jaeger.
[182:23.91]No, I said breathing on the toilet.
[182:25.89]Like, you're throwing up in the toilet, therefore you're breathing on the toilet.
[182:36.56]So much shit everywhere.
[182:38.02]Okay.
[182:41.26]Wall out, man.
[182:42.26]Alright, now what about... I want different floors on here, though.
[182:48.31]Actually, the floor... I can... No.
[182:50.03]No.
[182:51.07]No, fine.
[182:54.80]Wall, no, floor panels.
[182:57.88]Floor tile, floor panel.
[183:06.53]Let's just have this come out all the way.
[183:10.11]No reason not to.
[183:15.27]Looking good.
[183:16.63]Looking snazzy.
[183:19.28]Now in here.
[183:21.28]I want to say, this is because this is the real living quarters here.
[183:25.63]TV's gonna go right here.
[183:30.67]I'm gonna say, let's do some... Paul Sander.
[183:35.46]Get a carpet, too.
[183:36.40]Yeah, yeah, you know, let's do some green carpet.
[183:41.32]No.
[183:42.22]Some Darkwood.
[183:43.18]Is that what's already there?
[183:45.56]No.
[183:46.20]I gotta fix this.
[183:47.78]Get this thing out of here.
[183:48.86]It's ruining my whole house.
[183:54.51]No, I got a better idea.
[183:55.58]Like, I can't move it.
[183:57.44]It's a joke, so it has to stay there.
[184:00.02]Uh, here.
[184:00.62]I can't even get it in there.
[184:18.75]I cannot just paste over it?
[184:20.85]Someone will fall in there, though.
[184:22.07]Let's put, like, a fucking table on it or something.
[184:26.95]There we go.
[184:27.41]Okay, I can do something.
[184:28.57]I can cover it.
[184:37.88]I wonder if I can just go over it, though.
[184:39.86]No, I can't.
[184:45.97]Can't pick it up.
[184:48.19]Can't sell it.
[184:49.79]I can't destroy it.
[184:51.24]And I can't build in here.
[184:53.16]Wait.
[184:53.34]I don't know what I just did.
[184:56.32]I kind of feel like I shouldn't have done that.
[185:04.41]Look how... No, it has to be like a chair.
[185:07.45]No, I got an idea.
[185:10.07]I got an idea.
[185:14.37]I need, like, a nice couch chair.
[185:17.67]Like a lazy boy.
[185:22.69]Chairs.
[185:23.75]I mean, this is gonna... Okay, here we go.
[185:25.73]Armchair.
[185:40.38]Got it.
[185:54.24]What kind of a sicko would you have to be?
[185:56.20]I'm not sure.
[185:56.92]I don't know how much of a sick fuck you'd have to be.
[186:02.91]I like this wooden zebra.
[186:05.35]It's like an interesting zebra pattern.
[186:11.03]Almost like cat scratch.
[186:12.72]Yeah, this is cat scratch.
[186:13.88]I like it.
[186:22.61]What can I sell this for?
[186:23.54]I almost don't want to sell this.
[186:26.62]It's like four hours of work right now.
[186:28.72]How long has this stream been going on for?
[186:29.88]I mean, a green?
[186:40.85]A sky blue?
[186:41.49]Let's try sky blue in here.
[187:00.13]No, this sucks.
[187:04.42]Let's try indigo.
[187:17.20]That's... mmm.
[187:27.54]Mmm.
[187:28.68]I need more.
[187:34.45]Yeah, that's better.
[187:36.27]That looks really nice, actually.
[187:37.47]Why does everything have to be blue?
[187:44.90]No, what are you talking about?
[187:46.54]We have chocolate in here.
[187:50.22]Oh, fuck.
[187:51.08]They're right.
[187:51.46]I was trying to prove you wrong.
[187:54.92]Look at how correct you actually are.
[187:57.26]Oh, even the shelf is blue.
[187:58.92]Fuck.
[188:00.64]Ugh.
[188:10.27]But blue is like the best color.
[188:11.79]It just is.
[188:19.00]We're going to go.
[188:19.72]We're going to do like a half.
[188:21.08]We're going to do a half a year.
[188:22.58]Watch.
[188:32.32]No paint.
[188:33.00]$4,000.
[188:33.58]I still got enough money.
[188:36.64]I got plenty of money.
[188:43.10]I've got plenty of money.
[188:44.06]Don't worry about me.
[188:49.82]Yeah, three at a time.
[188:51.34]Is this the max upgrade?
[188:54.30]Where are skill points?
[188:55.02]What are they?
[188:56.00]Cleaning.
[188:56.80]See dirt.
[188:57.58]See some dirt.
[188:58.36]See most dirt.
[188:59.28]See all.
[189:01.68]See... I want to see more dirt on the minimap.
[189:04.16]Seriously.
[189:06.40]Desperately need that.
[189:07.24]Negotiation.
[189:09.18]Negotiation.
[189:12.96]Sell one more house and I can do this.
[189:16.10]Cleaning... What about... What is painting?
[189:19.46]Yeah, I can do four walls at the same time.
[189:23.71]Oh, don't worry.
[189:24.15]I can get this after I paint 568 more walls.
[189:28.67]Well, that sure is going to take a while.
[189:34.53]Are there cheat codes in the game?
[189:35.69]I don't think so.
[189:36.53]I think that would defeat the purpose of the whole game.
[189:39.50]This entire game is about slowly doing these things.
[189:44.22]Cheat codes would make the game.
[189:46.38]Like, what was the purpose of even buying it?
[189:51.92]Now, I'm going to do that.
[189:54.22]Let's take a look here.
[189:55.98]I'm curious.
[190:01.56]Just hold on.
[190:02.20]Hold on with me here.
[190:03.10]Let's wait until you see the whole thing.
[190:04.18]What do you mean, oh no?
[190:16.34]Don't oh no it yet.
[190:26.81]What is it?
[190:27.17]What is it?
[190:27.51]What does it look like?
[190:28.07]It looks like something very in particular.
[190:29.67]This whole color wheel here.
[190:32.89]Oh, what is it?
[190:33.83]Oh my god.
[190:35.69]What is it?
[190:38.57]It is something.
[190:39.33]It's something very, very in particular.
[190:44.61]You got it.
[190:45.05]Windows 98.
[190:48.67]Plus 100 points to that person.
[190:55.29]Absolutely perfect.
[190:56.75]You got it.
[191:07.21]Windows 98.
[191:08.09]It really is.
[191:11.83]You know, when you say something that's just completely correct.
[191:20.79]That's worth half a Canadian cent.
[191:25.66]Or zero.
[191:29.18]Buy plaster.
[191:31.78]Found what plaster is for.
[191:44.84]Plaster.
[191:59.15]Is that it?
[192:02.40]That's it, right?
[192:09.94]Why am I going so fast?
[192:10.84]I wasn't doing that before.
[192:13.79]Alright, I got the Windows 98 room.
[192:19.47]Now I kind of want a picture of Windows 98.
[192:30.21]Now, this isn't Sonic the Hedgehog.
[192:34.41]Like, this would be Sonic the Hedgehog.
[192:36.81]This is Windows 98.
[192:50.76]These dirty lights gotta go.
[192:52.10]These, like, dirty mummy lights.
[192:54.85]Lights made out of papier-mâché.
[192:56.11]Get the fuck out of here.
[192:57.51]What is this?
[193:12.44]Lookin' good!
[193:14.84]Lookin' good!
[193:16.50]Okay.
[193:17.26]So now... Let's, like, break this.
[193:20.52]Where is this coming from?
[193:21.36]I don't know.
[193:25.78]Uh, we need... This is the living space, so let's get the radiator.
[193:31.48]Let's get the appliances out of the way first.
[193:33.95]I need lights.
[193:39.45]Ceiling lights, please.
[193:47.29]I'm sticking with these.
[193:47.95]They're the easiest and they make the most light.
[193:50.79]Sneeze is coming again.
[193:51.49]I apologize.
[193:54.39]We're good.
[194:16.80]It doesn't have to be perfect.
[194:17.70]It just has to be there.
[194:24.40]Hey, beautiful.
[194:26.64]I like it.
[194:28.53]Let's get TV.
[194:31.03]TV stand probably first would be better.
[194:35.65]We got TV.
[194:37.09]TV stand.
[194:37.89]Yeah, that looks good.
[194:42.47]That matches pretty well.
[194:49.88]The other cable goes right there.
[195:23.31]Just in case somebody else is here and wants to play Sonic.
[195:31.39]I need to move this.
[195:35.26]Okay.
[195:42.98]Let's get a couch.
[195:49.51]We're going with the sofa shadow.
[195:51.89]I like it.
[195:53.82]Oh man, this is... Look at this one.
[195:58.74]I like it because it looks like TV static.
[196:10.99]It's a denim couch.
[196:15.16]Here we go.
[196:18.04]Wait, did somebody like something about this?
[196:21.00]I saw somebody looks like they said, ooh, I like that.
[196:26.62]Alright, radiator.
[196:33.26]Couch in the way.
[196:33.78]Ooh, I like that.
[196:42.79]What a good job you've done.
[196:48.00]The TV stand doesn't match anything else.
[196:51.08]I'll fix it.
[196:55.64]We'll do cherry green on it, whatever we need to do.
[196:58.52]Okay, this seems to be dark walnut.
[197:15.16]I think dark walnut looks like it's the correct one.
[197:18.72]There we go, that's perfect.
[197:20.24]Absolutely stunning.
[197:32.69]It has to be blue?
[197:33.66]No, it doesn't.
[197:34.14]Why does it have to be blue?
[197:35.84]Then it'll camouflage him with the wall.
[197:38.96]Double TVs in here.
[197:40.12]This is just in case, you know, you want to do a LAN with somebody.
[197:42.14]They can get in the beanbag and sit back and watch.
[197:45.43]They get their own separate switch here to turn all the lights off.
[197:48.39]Let's get some slider doors back here.
[197:55.59]Sliding doors.
[197:57.26]Brown.
[197:58.44]Bye.
[198:01.57]This one always just doesn't fit.
[198:03.07]You just don't fit.
[198:08.14]Why?
[198:12.86]Why does that one not fit?
[198:14.14]That's better.
[198:23.53]Privacy.
[198:33.38]There we go.
[198:33.88]Now my data is protected.
[198:40.72]Okay.
[198:44.66]Home appliances.
[198:50.57]Looks good.
[198:51.05]Refrigerator.
[198:53.57]I've got to have like a fucking stacked... A stacked up fridge, right?
[198:59.03]A little refrigerator stack.
[199:02.89]No, just in case you want to get a cold beer.
[199:12.01]Make the fan blue.
[199:18.83]You can't.
[199:21.12]It has to be white.
[199:23.20]Just in case you want to do a little bit of tailgating.
[199:25.24]You know what I mean?
[199:25.76]Tailgating in the man cave.
[199:30.26]Or for like a nice foot warmer.
[199:33.00]You know, this thing, I believe all gas stoves have heat and massage.
[199:37.57]So... That should be fine.
[199:40.07]Okay, that's alright.
[199:52.98]I think this room is done.
[199:54.02]Wait.
[199:55.84]Need... Oh, you need like an air conditioner too.
[200:03.35]No, I don't.
[200:04.07]I only have a heater.
[200:05.97]Sorry, you don't get something in the summer months.
[200:07.59]Home electronics.
[200:09.45]There we go.
[200:10.01]Microwave oven.
[200:11.01]Keyboard.
[200:13.17]Loudspeaker.
[200:14.09]Yeah, I could do a speaker system.
[200:15.57]Let's do this one.
[200:30.90]This thing's stupid.
[200:32.34]Why would you ever want this to come out of one part?
[200:34.86]This is awful.
[200:37.54]Don't you want two speakers?
[200:39.26]Or at least have it be a bar that lies down?
[200:44.71]Sounds all gonna come from one side of the TV.
[200:48.13]No, it ain't.
[200:55.77]Look at that shit.
[201:02.10]I'm ready to watch the game.
[201:06.79]I'm ready to watch the Patriots take on the Las Vegas Raiders.
[201:11.07]Oh, but wait.
[201:11.53]Where do his allegiances lie, though?
[201:13.63]What team does he truly believe in?
[201:14.63]Okay.
[201:14.77]Okay.
[201:26.02]That's good.
[201:27.24]I'm liking it.
[201:29.26]This is done.
[201:30.44]Close up the door here.
[201:32.74]Bathroom is done.
[201:35.00]Bedroom is done.
[201:36.89]Man cave is done.
[201:39.35]Wait, this is also a man cave.
[201:41.65]Oh.
[201:43.19]How do I get out of here?
[201:44.27]Oh, like this.
[201:47.07]Las Vegas has a football team?
[201:48.15]Yeah, they just actually bought the Raiders.
[201:50.57]Or they moved.
[201:51.21]The Raiders moved to Las Vegas.
[201:52.73]They're not the Oakland Raiders anymore.
[201:55.58]Alright, let's actually just... With whatever money we have available here, let me paint the rest of this house.
[202:04.13]This color here.
[202:07.03]Let's give them an actual living space.
[202:16.66]Do I like the Raiders?
[202:17.70]I mean, I don't really watch football.
[202:24.76]I mean, back when I used to care about football, sports, baseball, like, you know, Patriots, Red Sox.
[202:32.23]You know?
[202:34.23]What does this door lead?
[202:37.19]Into the family bathroom.
[202:42.31]You know what I thought about that?
[202:46.04]Even their house is blue.
[202:51.31]Two sinks?
[202:51.85]I didn't put those there.
[202:52.57]They were just there by default.
[203:01.90]I had nothing to do with that.
[203:09.93]Don't ask me.
[203:15.39]Come on.
[203:16.05]No.
[203:16.81]I need like one more dip in there.
[203:20.54]God damn it.
[203:21.14]I have to buy a whole other thing of paint.
[203:26.26]Shit.
[203:32.21]Which one was this one?
[203:33.01]Royal blue.
[203:35.63]Hope so.
[203:36.13]Cause that's what it's going to be.
[203:43.39]Okay.
[203:49.28]What the fuck am I doing here?
[203:50.52]Alright, hold on.
[203:53.46]Get rid of this.
[203:54.50]What is this here for?
[204:00.90]Looks like shit.
[204:02.18]Get rid of it.
[204:02.62]I need grey again.
[204:08.72]Grey can go all the way down here and around.
[204:10.60]I'm taking enough of the supports.
[204:16.38]You only need one big one.
[204:19.13]As long as you have one big support that goes right straight in the middle.
[204:23.39]Then you can take out every other support in your house.
[204:29.29]That was a load-bearing wall.
[204:32.05]Well, don't be over here.
[204:35.28]Unless you have to.
[204:39.46]I'm just grabbing a tent.
[204:41.42]And why do you think tents have been for the last, like, 60,000 years...
[204:46.04]the go-to since the dawn of civilization because they figured out a long time ago you don't need more than one support you're in a tent right now well that just shows just the the the level of your intelligence
[205:16.09]That just shows just how smart you actually are.
[205:20.31]That's a very smart thing to do.
[205:26.38]Most tents have more supports.
[205:27.52]Yeah, maybe the nice, like, high-tech ones.
[205:33.26]I don't believe in technology, though, so... I don't... I'm sorry.
[205:38.29]I don't vaccinate my tents.
[205:39.71]So, I mean, there's that.
[205:52.41]I was the first one to be in a tent.
[205:59.11]Mainstream with a computer does not believe in technology.
[206:01.97]I feel like I want to replace this floor.
[206:11.04]Is this floor stupid?
[206:12.34]I don't like this double... We're just taking the wood all the way down.
[206:17.32]Replace the tile here, taking the wood all the way down.
[206:24.43]It's almost sell time.
[206:30.61]Almost getting there.
[206:35.85]A little bit.
[206:42.91]Just bring the thing closer.
[206:44.80]I'm so lazy.
[206:47.40]You know when you're so lazy that it actually makes you do more work?
[206:51.44]And wouldn't you think you'd do the thing that was really easy for you?
[207:06.11]Not a lot picking up the paint can, though.
[207:08.25]Why would I do that?
[207:08.91]That's stupid.
[207:10.55]How much are you going to sell this house for?
[207:15.09]A lot.
[207:17.69]I'm going to say at least a real prediction would be between like 140 and 175 hundred thousand.
[207:28.54]Not single.
[207:29.46]We're talking to add a couple of zeros.
[207:37.57]Taking the wood all the way to the door.
[207:47.90]Add a couple of light coins.
[207:52.38]Yeah, that's what you gotta do.
[207:53.12]Let's just get rid of the structural support here.
[208:15.77]Wait, shit.
[208:16.65]I fucked this up big time, didn't I?
[208:22.89]Damn it.
[208:24.22]This wall's gonna be remade.
[208:25.74]No!
[208:26.50]Fuck!
[208:27.52]No, it doesn't.
[208:27.96]I don't care.
[208:28.32]I'm gonna see how you solve this problem.
[208:42.51]Thicken up your doorway.
[208:59.53]done how is the house standing engineering a building distance is one meter more can build five walls at once just do that's so much faster okay let's take a look yeah I mean it looks stupid but I'll fix it
[209:31.69]Alright, need to paint that.
[209:32.67]Hold on.
[209:33.09]Let's go with a 1, 2, 3.
[209:37.22]That's now the load-bearing wall right on the door.
[209:39.72]Yeah, that thing falls.
[209:40.48]Somebody knocks on the door.
[209:42.28]The load-bearing wall.
[209:43.08]That's gonna crash down on them with a simple door knock.
[210:10.52]Like this Anybody home?
[210:25.64]That was not that was such a bad sound effect Okay, well great
[210:37.11]Oh, hey, you shot?
[210:38.33]You home there, Jeremy?
[210:42.03]Done.
[210:46.55]That was filmed with a cell phone from 1996.
[210:48.31]Some heavy-duty equipment and set out to destroy a slew of vehicles.
[211:04.61]No, that's not right either.
[211:08.18]A huge crash sound.
[211:17.23]Hey, uh, you home there, Jeremy?
[211:23.38]I'm trying one more.
[211:26.12]Jeremy?
[211:27.32]Are you there?
[211:30.48]No, fucking, I'm done.
[211:31.94]Like, nobody knows how to make a goddamn crash sound.
[211:36.07]What happened to- what happened to making V- sounds?
[211:40.61]Unbelievable.
[211:41.13]Why is he- Alright, let's go.
[211:47.73]That would have been funny, wouldn't it have?
[211:50.70]Wouldn't it have?
[211:51.28]Okay.
[211:55.36]Somebody planted C4 behind the door.
[211:57.94]Alright, let's just finish the painting.
[212:13.27]Almost done.
[212:13.97]I actually like the way this place looks.
[212:16.77]As dumb and shitty of a joke as this was, I actually like this place.
[212:21.75]I'm going to be sad when four plus hours of this stream has been doing this house.
[212:28.03]And damn, it's going to go away.
[212:30.16]I'm never going to see this house again.
[212:33.34]Someone else is going to live in it.
[212:35.30]Alright.
[212:35.98]So that is, this is not painted all the way.
[212:38.60]Yes, it is.
[212:38.98]It just looks stupid.
[212:41.28]Alright.
[212:42.14]Speaking of looking stupid, god damn it.
[212:43.96]I need more gray paint.
[212:57.41]Right to the wall.
[212:58.85]And to the edge.
[213:00.47]That's better.
[213:01.07]Okay.
[213:03.67]All this is done?
[213:04.45]Nope.
[213:06.98]Make it the office?
[213:08.40]I can't.
[213:09.36]I can't.
[213:09.71]I need money.
[213:10.21]I only have a thousand dollars.
[213:18.81]How's it look underneath?
[213:24.27]I spent every cent I've made in this game so far on this house.
[213:28.54]So, I need to make, like, 200 grand.
[213:30.34]Because then we can buy a mansion.
[213:31.96]Then I'll make the mansion my office.
[213:34.90]Let's go do some cleaning jobs.
[213:38.36]I wonder how much I can get for this.
[213:41.81]Sell the old office.
[213:42.67]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[213:43.37]I'll do that.
[213:45.85]Washer and dryer is going to go here.
[213:47.07]Do I even have enough for that?
[213:52.19]I don't think so.
[213:52.75]Alright, I need wood.
[213:57.06]Floor panels.
[213:57.72]Where are they?
[213:58.12]I think this is the current one?
[214:05.66]No, that's not even right.
[214:12.17]There it is.
[214:12.67]What?
[214:12.87]That's not even right either.
[214:19.53]That's not even correct either.
[214:30.68]What?
[214:46.64]Is this one even available?
[214:57.13]I didn't even put this... Wait, did I?
[214:58.37]Hold on.
[214:58.75]I didn't put this one in, did I?
[215:00.95]This was just here like this, wasn't it?
[215:02.19]What do you mean ruined?
[215:10.13]I'm about to replace it.
[215:12.59]This was default!
[215:14.91]I'm replacing... Lookit, you want me to keep this too?
[215:23.32]What are you guys on about?
[215:26.78]This is what I'm gonna put on here.
[215:41.15]Dark brown is better?
[215:43.25]I like the light brown.
[215:47.69]I thought that was a bug right there, but it's actually a tree.
[215:57.44]Hmm.
[215:58.80]Does he like something that I don't like?
[216:03.33]Nope!
[216:20.80]Wait, is that shade of brown not even on the tooth whitening commercial scale?
[216:29.39]Literally the next one on the next shade from yellow to white.
[216:34.55]I don't know if I can be in the stream anymore.
[216:59.39]When I hold my teeth up to the strip that shows what color the wood is towards my teeth, it's not the right one.
[217:07.15]You picked the wrong one.
[217:08.39]Hey, shut up, Jeremy.
[217:29.57]Look, the only difference between this one is this looks like somebody put, like, cigarette ashes on it.
[217:33.27]That's the only difference.
[217:34.09]I'm gonna leave that.
[217:48.26]God, panic.
[217:48.88]Panic!
[217:55.69]Nice.
[217:56.43]Okay.
[218:05.30]Mmm, getting some frame problems, okay.
[218:06.82]Yeah, as much as I'm like kidding around, I actually, I can't handle that either.
[218:21.95]Get it all?
[218:25.77]I can't, I wish I could see.
[218:31.54]These lights suck.
[218:33.56]They just, like, point on the walls.
[218:37.97]This is too shiny.
[218:38.87]I don't like the shiny floor.
[218:40.23]It's too glary.
[218:41.35]Why didn't you guys tell me about this?
[218:43.03]You should have warned me that this was gonna happen.
[218:52.28]Finally, he notices.
[218:53.24]Alright, what's going in the, uh... What's going in the laundry room slash kitchen?
[218:59.15]Can I make this?
[218:59.87]No, let's do the... This is the laundry room.
[219:03.85]Bathtub.
[219:05.27]Shower.
[219:06.55]Toilet.
[219:06.99]No, this is the bathroom.
[219:08.65]Fuck.
[219:10.15]Get rid of that ghastly looking thing.
[219:12.23]Okay, lights.
[219:21.88]Hmm.
[219:23.58]This is fine.
[219:26.86]This thing is kind of huge, though, unfortunately.
[219:30.88]Is this huge, or am I going crazy?
[219:33.26]This thing is gigantic, isn't it?
[219:34.72]Yeah, okay, this is too big.
[219:41.90]That's too bright, isn't it?
[219:43.08]I mean, it's alright.
[219:54.25]I think it can...
[219:57.54]Yeah, this has to go in the other room.
[219:58.64]Get two of those.
[220:19.21]How is that less light now?
[220:23.43]My electrical bill?
[220:24.47]That'll be alright.
[220:25.23]Don't worry.
[220:27.58]I ain't paying for it anyways.
[220:34.98]Cockpit in the bathroom.
[220:37.11]There's a tile down here.
[220:38.95]I'm gonna leave this tile.
[220:40.07]No, I don't like this tile.
[220:42.25]I'm gonna make... I'm gonna do the really funky one.
[220:44.77]Remember the blue one?
[220:46.93]This shit right here.
[220:47.79]Get some light in here first, though.
[220:54.60]Hmm.
[221:04.39]Two of these guys in here.
[221:05.67]Well, I feel like I got, like, kind of crooked, but that's fine.
[221:08.95]Okay, it's the blue house.
[221:17.41]Aye-yi-yi!
[221:23.13]Okay, I think we just need one.
[221:24.35]Right?
[221:29.45]Right-click again.
[221:30.31]I will just throw up.
[221:34.81]Yeah, that really just looked like a public bathroom.
[221:38.15]Looks like a Walmart bathroom.
[221:41.70]Alright, that's fine.
[221:43.14]These are dirty and dingy, though.
[221:44.36]I don't think I can even clean these up.
[221:47.40]Now, these have got to go.
[221:48.06]These things have to get out of here.
[221:49.32]Let's do the paneling first.
[222:01.65]Um... Okay.
[222:06.43]Why do I still have that in my hand?
[222:13.10]Blue house.
[222:13.94]No.
[222:15.04]That's fine.
[222:18.68]$8 sinks.
[222:19.06]Well, that's what they could be refurbished and recycled for.
[222:33.33]Yes, I do realize this is like a...
[222:36.99]I understand.
[222:37.49]I know exactly what you guys are going to say.
[222:39.01]This is the public bathroom at an amusement park.
[222:44.95]I know.
[222:46.65]This is like one of the bathrooms at Disney.
[222:49.62]It'll be fine.
[222:50.18]You'll be alright.
[222:50.70]I need more of those tiles, man.
[223:06.84]Why are you doing this to me?
[223:08.30]There we go.
[223:12.90]Pick it up.
[223:15.16]I like it.
[223:16.08]I like it, too.
[223:17.91]I do not like this.
[223:22.35]Play a game for my real IQ, like Minecraft.
[223:27.15]Thanks, man.
[223:27.55]I appreciate that.
[223:29.71]I really appreciate you saying that.
[223:30.73]Because, you know, like the Star Trek Next Generation...
[223:37.10]the ship, you know, the Voyager from Star Trek Voyager that was made in that game.
[223:42.17]Like, that took tons of effort and an incredibly intelligent person.
[223:47.09]Oh, sorry, you know, somebody just made the Taj Mahal in, like, one square block.
[223:53.88]Yeah, but please tell me.
[223:55.78]Please tell me that, like, putting up wooden panels is, like, a smarter game.
[224:09.54]Voyager was trash?
[224:11.30]Whoa, hold on a second here.
[224:12.58]Are you saying that the best Star Trek is the worst Star Trek?
[224:19.55]Do you want to get started on that?
[224:23.09]Trash?
[224:23.81]Oh, yeah, let's let, but what about like Captain Kirk?
[224:26.13]He was so great, though.
[224:28.91]Wasn't William Shatner like, oh, he moved around like this, and let's go, I don't know.
[224:37.59]Dude, in Star Trek Voyager, really weird shit happens.
[224:46.86]That was a bad impression.
[224:48.04]Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[224:49.26]You understand my point.
[224:51.98]Spock was the only cool person on that show.
[224:54.50]The rest of them were shit-faced every day.
[224:57.12]Like, Spock was the only one that was acting.
[224:59.57]They all thought that they were actually doing that.
[225:13.31]bad no it's not I like it okay I can't disagree with that okay picard was the best captain and data was the best computer okay but voyager I feel like had the best scenarios they just had really strange interesting scenarios every episode data was the best like doctor computer thing
[225:40.82]Data's not a computer.
[225:43.32]What was he then?
[225:44.88]He was a guy.
[225:45.62]Oh, just a guy?
[225:46.24]He was an android.
[225:47.60]Android is a computer.
[225:49.12]He was a robot person.
[225:52.42]How is that not a computer?
[225:56.50]He was a doctor computer analyzer person.
[226:00.97]Data was a human.
[226:01.93]No, they made him human in one of the dumb movies.
[226:05.71]Spoiler alert.
[226:06.77]They make make Data a human.
[226:19.72]How am I not a computer?
[226:21.64]I'm not a computer.
[226:28.74]This room is ugly.
[226:30.13]He's made of metal.
[226:32.51]The computer in Voyager was actually the computer.
[226:36.07]He was the ship.
[226:37.49]And he could just kind of holograph and teleport himself into places.
[226:41.31]He wasn't actually there.
[226:45.01]The actor was a good actor.
[226:47.84]Doctor.
[226:48.28]His name was just Doctor.
[226:49.70]Of course it was... Okay.
[226:50.90]Doctor.
[226:51.76]Data.
[226:52.12]They're just Doctor Data Processing Computers anyways.
[226:55.70]It doesn't matter.
[226:56.18]They could both be the same character.
[226:57.26]Alright, let's go to floor tiles.
[227:05.20]I'm not doing the psychedelic purple.
[227:11.35]Jerma cannot sell the captcha.
[227:14.63]Huh?
[227:23.23]I like these.
[227:27.61]Jeremiah, just shut it.
[227:30.77]Oh, just fucking around.
[227:31.89]Star Trek, all Star Trek is terrible.
[227:33.91]So, like, it doesn't matter what my opinion is on it.
[227:37.59]I'm kidding.
[227:38.25]I'm kidding.
[227:38.81]It's a joke.
[227:39.70]Star Trek is good.
[227:40.54]I love Star Trek.
[227:43.60]That was a joke.
[227:44.36]I'm actually kidding about that.
[227:45.50]I watch Star Trek all the time.
[227:49.67]That's a joke.
[227:51.25]Don't worry.
[227:52.00]Your favorite Star Trek episode is probably my favorite Star Trek episode.
[227:55.24]I promise.
[227:59.30]But I do think that Voyager is the best Star Trek series.
[228:05.45]Now we need... I don't want to shower in here.
[228:08.23]I'm going to get a bath.
[228:09.19]Because I don't have enough money.
[228:14.03]What's the cheapest toilet?
[228:15.13]This one.
[228:16.12]No, they're both the same.
[228:16.86]It's standard toilet.
[228:24.55]What's my favorite Star Trek episode?
[228:25.82]I can tell you that right now.
[228:28.48]It's in Voyager.
[228:30.80]Spoiler alert if you don't want to hear Voyager spoilers.
[228:34.09]It's the episode where the whole ship gets cloned.
[228:38.27]and the whole episode you're following around the cloned ship and they start to disintegrate and get like diseased and like melt away as people and you don't know why that's happening and at the very end of the episode they all fucking die and then their ship explodes and then it comes out they were trying to send like a distress signal out to a ship
[228:59.11]Like, somebody please fucking save us!
[229:01.45]And you find out at the very end that they were like the clones.
[229:04.41]And the actual Voyager crew sees the explosion really fucking far away and goes, huh, I wonder what that was.
[229:12.06]It's a great episode.
[229:13.16]It's my favorite Star Trek episode.
[229:16.42]That episode was awful.
[229:17.50]Excuse me.
[229:18.82]You're trying to get yourself permanently internet protocol banned from my chat.
[229:28.39]I have to put the bathtub right next to the... It's going to go in the corner, right?
[229:36.41]I'm going to have to unscrew this dumb thing.
[229:43.16]Who cloned them and why?
[229:44.82]They went through this weird... They landed on some planet or something and got some weird clone disease.
[229:49.82]And they didn't even know what happened to them.
[229:59.55]That was a Doctor Who episode, not Star Trek.
[230:01.76]No, it was not.
[230:02.50]That is a Star Trek episode.
[230:03.96]The episode is called Oblivion.
[230:09.50]That's not Doctor Who.
[230:13.92]Terma, who's the worst doctor?
[230:15.78]Oh, I could... I've never seen one episode of that show.
[230:24.52]That's an Elder Scrolls game.
[230:27.40]Ha ha ha ha.
[230:29.94]Only real Star Trek kids remember.
[230:34.31]Nah, you gotta love Picard, though.
[230:35.31]Picard's the best captain.
[230:39.07]Engage.
[230:40.82]That was a terrible Picard.
[230:41.78]Pretend I didn't say that.
[230:43.22]Nobody was here for that one.
[231:02.54]And plus, like, you gotta love, like, the weird chef guy, Neelix.
[231:08.23]Let me just ask you a question, Captain.
[231:10.03]Do you like my, uh, fudgicle cake?
[231:12.89]That guy was great.
[231:13.39]That guy was just like, oh, the fucking tub is in the... Everyone hates Neelix?
[231:22.77]No, they don't.
[231:42.53]Somebody built a house Well, I seem to have messed up here.
[231:48.68]Well, it's alright.
[231:49.52]I'll just take this wall down and do it again Talk about a waste of company resources Come here you fucking little shit

[232:13.01]Get over here.
[232:13.77]I can't pick you up.
[232:17.27]Fine.
[232:18.35]Get IP banned.
[232:19.65]Fucking dumb door.
[232:24.39]Won't be seeing him again.
[232:26.14]Saying all that fucked up shit about me.
[232:32.84]Door, door, door, door, door.
[232:34.52]There it is.
[232:44.77]That's better.
[232:47.09]Okay.
[232:49.05]Now let's just put this back up.
[232:51.05]Seal it up.
[232:51.51]Wait, I can't do that yet.
[232:52.79]One sec.
[232:53.27]Right there is good.
[233:06.12]Excuse me.
[233:06.81]Crunch.
[233:09.15]Don't you just want to eat this wall?
[233:11.73]I feel like I know exactly what this wall tastes like.
[233:17.77]Tastes like the blue popsicle.
[233:21.77]In... I mean, not really.
[233:38.78]Why did I break the last one?
[233:42.86]Because I'm strong.
[233:46.00]What's going on under here?
[233:49.20]There's trash there that I never picked up.
[233:51.40]Alright, let's do... What do we need now?
[233:53.90]We need the sink.
[233:55.92]Okay.
[233:57.22]Sink.
[234:03.73]Mountable sink.
[234:08.03]Oh, fuck you.
[234:10.11]Okay, that's fine.
[234:14.15]That's fine.
[234:15.00]That was actually almost very bad.
[234:24.09]No, slide the washer down.
[234:26.91]Why am I so obsessed with tile?
[234:29.89]Because it sounds really cool when you touch it and, like, knock your fingers on it.
[234:33.18]Like, I can't even do it because this is wood.
[234:36.30]Next time you get a chance, go up to tile and take your knuckles and just slowly tap on it.
[234:45.06]Take your fingernails and just go, like, on the tile.
[234:49.02]It sounds like fingernail rain.
[234:50.24]It's amazing, man.
[234:58.97]Audiosyncratic mandatory remittance, right?
[235:01.63]That ASMR feeling.
[235:21.04]Stick it on there, come on.
[235:27.85]Okay, that's good.
[235:29.51]I hate how close this is.
[235:30.67]I wish this was like The Sims where I could just move it.
[235:32.95]But you have to have the dumb infrastructure, and you can't put the infrastructure in.
[235:37.68]Tile radiator.
[235:39.94]A towel radiator, not a... You know what I was trying to say.
[235:44.60]And have you tried my vertical cake yet?
[235:52.99]Do I like ASMR?
[235:54.03]No.
[235:56.17]I mean...
[235:57.95]No, I mean, it's... I don't want to offend anybody.
[236:05.11]Look, I like crinkling up paper bags.
[236:08.98]You know what I mean?
[236:09.78]I guess when I open up a new bag of chips, and it makes that sound, it's kind of cool.
[236:16.18]But no, I don't want somebody to put a hairbrush in my ear.
[236:22.74]I don't want somebody to pretend to shave my face.
[236:26.79]You know, like, that gets a little weird for me.
[236:35.14]I enjoy, like, the notebook tapping.
[236:37.80]Brain.
[236:38.32]I enjoy, like, the little crinkle sounds.
[236:41.14]But once you, like, want to give me, like, an ear exam as a fake doctor, that's where it's like, okay, it's time for me to click somewhere else on the internet.
[237:01.89]ASMR is nice until people start talking.
[237:05.79]Yeah, I think everybody loves those little, like, sounds.
[237:08.09]Like, uh... Glass shattering.
[237:11.87]Someone dragging their fingernails on a chalkboard.
[237:14.05]That's very, you know, that sounds nice.
[237:17.40]The dentist drill.
[237:25.78]Fuck, I can't have a TV right over the bathtub.
[237:30.56]I only have $200.
[237:31.02]Oh, no.
[237:33.32]Um... We need to... I need to do another mission.
[237:39.46]Oh, back to the mission.
[237:41.16]Back to the office.
[237:41.82]Let's go.
[237:42.16]Toaster.
[237:48.43]Put a toaster in the bathtub.
[237:51.61]What?
[237:51.87]Just to warn them?
[237:53.11]What do you want?
[237:53.55]What do you mean?
[237:56.13]My house sucks.
[237:57.39]I want a new house.
[237:58.29]This place is so bad.
[238:01.41]This is when I just was learning how to play the game.
[238:07.16]Were those two thousand dollar posters worth it?
[238:10.80]Of course they weren't.
[238:13.18]Of course not.
[238:14.24]No, not even in the slightest.
[238:17.32]Help to clean a big house, please.
[238:21.10]After the death of my beloved wife, I sold our old house as it brings back so many memories that I cannot cope with.
[238:25.90]I decided to buy a new house and it requires some work.
[238:28.54]Needs cleaning and new radiators.
[238:29.92]It is too much work for me and I don't have the strength.
[238:31.82]This is fucking like sad.
[238:33.36]I'd like to move out of my old house as soon as possible, but it's too painful to live here.
[238:40.09]My two daughters will be living with me and would like their rooms to be painted their favorite color, bright blue.
[238:46.15]I'm taking this one.
[238:53.57]That was sad.
[238:56.89]Clean the house.
[239:04.45]We're gonna speedrun this one.
[239:08.39]This is a big house, though.
[239:11.05]Oh, damn it.
[239:11.59]We gotta go room to room, actually.
[239:14.83]Okay, this is clean the window.
[239:16.21]This is gonna take a while.
[239:17.27]Hopefully this is a lot of money.
[239:25.43]That's good.
[239:25.71]Get some fresh air.
[239:30.46]Paint.
[239:31.34]All.
[239:31.74]No.
[239:32.06]Oh, God.
[239:32.66]That was... I'm not going to do that.
[239:35.46]I just threw up because you said that.
[239:42.02]Let's try to place object.
[239:43.29]Bed.
[239:43.59]Mount devices.
[239:45.35]Yeah, he's radiating.
[239:46.51]Am I... He paying for this?
[239:48.35]How much money do I have?
[239:49.51]450?
[239:49.55]He's paying for this, right?
[239:50.27]Okay.
[240:02.96]Why do I like this game so much?
[240:05.68]I'm serious.
[240:06.36]Like, I'm not even kidding.
[240:07.46]This is... Not a joke.
[240:09.32]I'm not even kidding.
[240:09.94]I'm not even kidding.
[240:10.40]I swear to God.
[240:10.84]I gotta go.
[240:11.38]I'm not even kidding.
[240:12.30]I gotta go.
[240:12.94]I gotta go, guys.
[240:13.42]I'm not even kidding.
[240:14.04]I swear to God.
[240:14.47]I gotta go.
[240:14.79]I'm not even kidding.
[240:19.39]Uh... So... Place object bed solid.
[240:26.58]Bed solid.
[240:30.17]This is the kind of bed you want for your daughter?
[240:31.49]This is like a fucking prison bed.
[240:35.91]Desk?
[240:36.71]What kind of desk?
[240:37.25]I don't have any money.
[240:46.57]I can't pay for this.
[240:47.33]I don't have any money.
[240:57.84]uh why did I take the job I didn't think I was gonna have to spend money on this job I thought I had to like paint a room and clean the house with my bare hands whatever we're gonna we're gonna do this one to 70 and take the money alright let's go slowly room to room here because there's a bunch of shit everywhere yeah I have to sit wait a minute
[241:31.51]Fuck.
[241:31.69]I thought I could.
[241:37.45]Mount devices.
[241:38.19]I don't have enough money to mount any of these devices.
[241:41.12]Am I going to be able to do this?
[241:42.74]Just by cleaning?
[241:45.14]Maybe.
[241:48.30]It's going to be tricky, though.
[241:49.36]Yeah, we'll do a 70% job and then leave.
[242:06.78]That's very bad and sad, but I don't have any money to do this.
[242:20.88]That's fine.
[242:21.48]Clean dirt.
[242:23.96]Do I have to mount anything?
[242:25.20]Probably not.
[242:27.64]No, screw that.
[242:32.73]Honestly, I just don't have enough.
[242:33.75]I can't do it.
[242:40.36]Getting decent money for doing this, though.
[242:42.66]So that's fine.
[242:43.80]As long as I can take this to 70%.
[242:47.24]That's going to be so sad if I can't.
[242:50.40]Sad because bad.
[242:51.49]Sad because bad.
[243:05.11]Looking good.
[243:07.19]I don't have enough to mount the device, so let's just keep going into the other room.
[243:14.77]Remember guys, say it with me.
[243:15.87]Sad because bad.
[243:16.93]Mad because bad.
[243:17.91]Sad because bad.
[243:35.53]I don't know if it's gonna get there.
[243:36.53]This sucks.
[243:39.54]I'm in deep shit here.
[243:45.98]How dirty is the rest of your house?
[243:56.57]I don't know.
[243:57.29]It's gonna be tight.
[244:02.00]No, mad because bad.
[244:03.32]Mad because... I can't even do it.
[244:05.37]I was gonna just say something else.
[244:06.61]I was gonna say glad because Chad.
[244:12.17]It's hard to say out of my mouth.
[244:26.16]No, is there an upstairs too?
[244:29.45]What a waste of time this is going to end up being if it's not the case.
[244:37.25]Can I get an advance?
[244:38.15]There's still dirt in this room.
[244:44.11]Place bed.
[244:44.85]Dirt's gone.
[244:48.86]Mount device.
[244:49.50]I don't think I can afford it.
[244:55.38]44 bucks.
[244:56.44]I can do this one.
[244:59.30]Hopefully this is not a waste of fucking money.
[245:09.32]Is this still the old house?
[245:10.36]No, this is one of the emissions.
[245:16.32]Minimum of $10.
[245:18.82]Paint with the color Sleepy Blue.
[245:20.98]Do I have enough to paint?
[245:21.84]How much is paint?
[245:24.78]Like $5?
[245:24.94]No, it's too expensive.
[245:30.83]This is a wash, guys.
[245:32.03]I can't do it.
[245:33.49]Game over.
[245:38.92]We're not even getting to 40% here.
[245:40.02]I have to take a different task.
[245:52.47]Nope.
[245:53.23]Game over.
[245:55.15]Alright, I'm done.
[246:03.06]I guess I could do this.
[246:04.04]And then I can save it and come back.
[246:27.13]Hey look, you gotta do what you gotta do.
[246:31.96]Nobody can break in here, right?
[246:34.70]Can I sell my laptop?
[246:41.13]Alright.
[246:42.93]That's good.
[246:45.13]Let's go... End of the era.
[246:50.09]Browser.
[246:53.73]First office.
[246:54.49]That one.
[246:54.89]Where's the... Can I go back to... Burned house?
[247:00.79]For a second, I thought I burnt a house down.
[247:07.61]Archive.
[247:07.97]Can I go back?
[247:18.55]I'm not sure I can go back there.
[247:27.12]Oh, well.
[247:29.03]I think I have enough money, though, to be able to put in... It's the second email?
[247:35.97]Oh, resume.
[247:36.41]Here we go.
[247:36.71]Okay.
[247:39.49]Matt, because bad.
[247:40.53]Matt, because bad!
[247:46.24]My phone's dead.
[247:48.32]What a piece of shit, you know what I'm saying?
[247:49.70]Alright, we got a radiator there.
[247:52.28]I gotta paint this room sleepy blue.
[247:59.29]Sleepy blue.
[248:01.47]There it is.
[248:01.99]Okay, there it is.
[248:18.86]Why am I painting a prison?
[248:20.98]Because I have bad interior decoration skill set.
[248:23.66]Just don't have it.
[248:31.02]Load it up.
[248:33.16]Slide it on.
[248:33.76]For a second, I thought this was costing money every time I rolled it.
[248:47.57]What's your guys' favorite ResidentSleeper moment, do you think?
[249:00.22]I mean, of all time.
[249:01.88]Of any stream you've ever watched.
[249:03.96]Not just this one.
[249:19.50]I actually like this color a lot.
[249:20.56]It does remind me of one of those dopey, sleepy hats.
[249:28.89]I could see this room having cartoon Z's come out of it.
[249:31.88]In like a thought bubble.
[249:34.94]Every moment of every stream.
[249:38.54]I don't think that sounds like a boring stream problem.
[249:40.23]I think that sounds like a you sleep a lot problem.
[249:44.89]What about the- Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you guys.
[249:46.61]I started laughing out loud.
[249:49.53]Like, three or four days ago.
[249:50.55]I was in the grocery store and just started cracking the fuck up laughing my ass off.
[249:56.28]At the loud piano guy.
[249:58.50]That really, like, max volume mashing the piano.
[250:04.38]With that, like, kid that was sleeping.
[250:09.64]I don't know why, I just thought about it.
[250:10.86]I just thought of, like... And his headphones on, like...
[250:15.38]It made me fucking laugh.
[250:16.86]I was laughing at it again.
[250:20.55]After all this time, yeah.
[250:23.83]Just seeing him sleeping through that.
[250:30.32]I cannot link the vid because it doesn't exist.
[250:38.34]We had a... This was a stream.
[250:40.70]This wasn't a video.
[250:43.94]We spent a long time desperately trying to find it.
[250:47.55]I need another tube of toothpaste here.
[250:59.32]Yeah, that was back at the Red Dead Redemption stream.
[251:06.54]That shit was so outrageous, man.
[251:14.28]He's referencing... Yeah, I'm referencing... I'm referencing... I'm referencing a stream I watched.
[251:22.13]This is back when IRL was just really barely, I think, even getting any traction at all.
[251:29.15]I'm not even sure IRL was a category at this point.
[251:33.17]Dude is sleeping in his bed that has loud song donations.
[251:37.29]And he was asleep with his headphones on.
[251:40.62]and people were just putting out fucking outrageous shit and just trying to wake him up and the one like everyone's already heard it before but it doesn't matter I can say it again the fucking piano there was a mash the piano loud over just you went into the audio program and you push the decibels up as high as it can go just blasting out your ears with somebody mashing on a piano
[252:08.40]And just watching this dude sleep in this bed with this going on.
[252:13.10]I don't know why it happened.
[252:14.74]Something about it was so fucking funny.
[252:20.09]I'm retelling it verbatim.
[252:21.11]Maybe these people weren't here.
[252:22.65]Maybe a lot of people weren't here.
[252:34.15]Just the absolute fucking absurdity of the whole situation.
[252:40.60]I just kept on analyzing it over and over again in my head.
[252:45.31]sleeping guy sleeping on Twitch why are you doing that first of all what are we doing then has headphones on other people that just don't give a about anything just blasting in his ears just trying to wake this dude up he won't wake up and it was song after song after loud noise was like explosion sounds screaming and he was just asleep oh
[253:15.47]It's like, what a fucking time to be alive, man.
[253:17.79]Seriously.
[253:19.93]What do we got for paint?
[253:22.89]99%.
[253:23.23]What's this other percentage?
[253:27.42]Right there.
[253:29.04]Alright, now I need a computer desk.
[253:34.34]Computer desk.
[253:39.00]Doesn't matter.
[253:40.58]Office chair.
[253:50.13]Making me spend so much money here.
[253:54.27]Wardrobe Charles.
[253:55.51]That's the wrong way.
[254:08.82]She'll figure it out.
[254:10.78]Chest of Drawers.
[254:15.57]Chest of Drawers.
[254:16.85]Chest of Drawers.
[254:18.43]Chest of Drawers.

[254:50.02]Yeah, somebody's logged on AIM.
[254:54.16]Most of the money's already gone.
[254:55.81]I just have to get this to 70%, 75% or whatever.
[254:59.35]Clean the window.
[255:05.07]All that really is... The only thing that needs to be done to the other house is some random kitchen stuff.
[255:14.33]A piano to mash on.
[255:20.29]Double bed Hermes.
[255:30.18]Bed Hermes, where's my money?

[256:09.98]I don't have anything else to sell.
[256:12.36]You think I'm gonna sell any of my computers?
[256:15.16]Or any of my... posters or anything?
[256:23.56]Jeremy's the dad that plays Microsoft Flight Simulator, but he's not smart enough to play that, so he plays House Flipper.
[256:30.70]Look, I never told you guys I was smart for playing this game.
[256:33.76]I was told I was stupid for playing Minecraft, which is that's not true.
[256:36.80]You guys know that Elon Musk makes all of his employees play Minecraft for at least 40 hours when they first join the company?
[257:00.41]Okay, gray and royal blue.
[257:01.89]Let's get gray.
[257:16.66]Everyone's talking about shorting Tesla, by the way.
[257:34.57]This is not financial advice, but, uh, word on the street is, uh, short, short Tesla.
[257:42.93]I didn't say that, though.
[257:43.67]Somebody said that on the internet.
[257:46.01]It's not me telling you that.
[257:47.26]Fucking dumbass thing.
[257:57.90]No, somebody said, I didn't say that.
[257:59.16]Somebody in chat said that.
[258:00.10]I'm just seeing what they said.
[258:02.15]Short and got margin called.
[258:05.70]I didn't do anything.
[258:09.52]I'm not giving you financial advice.
[258:11.32]Is this gray?
[258:15.81]This is like a dark gray.
[258:37.96]What does that even mean?
[258:38.92]That means you put an order in that you think that the stock price of Tesla is going to go down.
[258:44.82]That is what a short did mean.
[258:47.24]That's what it means when you're shorting something.
[258:50.86]If you do a long, a long is you are anticipating the stock is going to go up.
[258:55.92]Up, up, up.
[258:59.06]So when I say people are short Tesla, I'm saying that people are anticipating that the stock is going to go down.
[259:08.04]learned that from the big short yeah that movie with I was gonna say dan akroyd but that would be wrong Steve Carell go long on bald coin with a hundred times leverage and uh lose your all of your money in like 11 seconds
[259:32.35]Alright.
[259:33.13]Double bed Hermes.
[259:34.27]I can't even afford it.
[259:36.33]We're so close.
[259:37.65]Anything else need to be painted?
[259:38.55]Something that's a radiator.
[259:43.63]Okay, towel radiator.

[260:05.32]No, I did not do the emote stream.
[260:06.88]I am postponing it until later on this week.
[260:10.23]Just wasn't ready for it.
[260:13.25]Blame the toilet and the water problem.
[260:17.79]Fuck.

[260:21.23]This is my only hope is radiators.
[260:30.28]That's all I can afford to do.
[260:38.67]Who uses radiators in today's world?
[260:41.33]Probably plenty of people that live in a house.
[260:53.71]So close.
[260:56.63]Oh, this is gonna be so... This is gonna just be such a tease.
[261:01.05]It really is gonna just tease us.
[261:02.35]Because I can't do anything else.
[261:07.08]Nothing else.
[261:07.74]No, come on.
[261:08.26]There's one more radiator right here.
[261:11.07]Get your dumb table out of the way.
[261:18.89]Please get us there.
[261:21.46]What if I give you a big radiator?
[261:25.54]I can't even do that.
[261:29.04]Come on. 70%.
[261:40.53]done there's another radiator come on please oh this has to be it big radiator alright that's huge that has to be at least a few points
[262:14.26]Yes!
[262:16.65]7,900 bucks.
[262:17.11]We can finish the house.
[262:26.73]Alright, time to finish the house and sell it.
[262:28.25]Let's head over to the huckster's house.
[262:36.16]Go to house.
[262:44.75]Leaving the table and sofa out there?
[262:46.15]Who cares?
[262:50.17]Do two more $4,000 posters.
[262:57.54]Yeah, this is the Breaking Bad house.
[263:02.64]I wonder if there's any other replicated houses in this game.
[263:06.44]I'm sure there is.
[263:06.98]Alright.
[263:14.20]Looks good.
[263:16.34]Scale points available.
[263:17.96]Negotiation.
[263:18.76]Increased chance of successful negotiations by 5%.
[263:23.38]Minus 2% of the order's requirements.
[263:30.58]Probably say price negotiation is probably better, right?
[263:36.52]Because this is... This brings it down to like, what, 68%?
[263:39.10]Definitely negotiation.
[263:44.63]So I get an increased chance to get better sales.
[263:51.09]Alright, the family wants to move in here.
[263:54.75]Looks good.
[263:55.67]Make sure everything's clean.
[263:56.67]Yeah, that works.
[264:04.50]Check out our room.
[264:05.22]Alright, there's the man cave.
[264:10.44]Generator in there.
[264:11.30]Alright, now here is the other man cave.
[264:13.69]With the massaging unit.
[264:16.09]Double speakers.
[264:17.95]Data privacy vent.
[264:20.07]And two TVs.
[264:20.97]Okay.
[264:22.31]Still have to put on a few of these radiators.
[264:26.93]And I gotta get laundry shit.
[264:32.51]Yeah, that's... I would say probably $7,000 or $8,000 in posters.
[264:35.83]That's correct.
[264:44.08]New tile here.
[264:47.10]Floor tile.
[264:50.79]Floor tile.
[264:51.35]Let's do... This is a kitchen, so let's make it... This one will be fine.
[265:04.57]That's homey.
[265:04.85]That's homey.
[265:15.87]That's homey.
[265:17.84]No, that's homey.
[265:20.50]This is the exact floor of my grandmother's house.
[265:25.84]I swear to God, I almost want a picture of it.
[265:27.84]It's the same floor.
[265:34.62]Yeah, I know someone's going to make a Minecraft skin joke.
[265:36.79]Go ahead and make it.
[265:37.81]Because it's available for you.
[265:39.53]Or like a shitty poo Tetris.
[265:42.57]Whichever one you want to make.
[265:43.75]Either one works.
[265:50.86]Let's paint again.
[265:51.68]Do I have any paint left over?
[265:54.02]No.
[265:55.66]This is empty.
[265:56.42]Something's got to go here.
[266:00.35]Something has to go, right?
[266:01.09]Like a stereo or something.
[266:02.43]Alright.
[266:05.81]Paint.
[266:14.11]Royal Blue.
[266:24.58]A poster can go there.
[266:30.26]Yeah, I could put a poster here.
[266:32.62]Should it be more than three grand, though?
[266:34.16]I'm not sure.
[266:34.72]Alright, we need... Washer.
[266:39.73]Let's get a washer and dryer in here.
[266:49.95]Washer.
[266:57.77]I just realized this is the kitchen.
[267:00.90]This is the kitchen.
[267:02.48]You don't do laundry in the kitchen.
[267:12.03]Maybe you do.
[267:20.50]You do in the UK?
[267:21.42]Do you really?
[267:25.71]Well, I guess you could throw all your dishes in here, too, couldn't you?
[267:32.74]Yeah, you could just throw- you could put your dishes in here.
[267:40.17]Spin cycle.
[267:42.35]Mmmmmmm.
[267:43.15]Pfft.
[268:00.20]Stick it on.
[268:00.86]Screw it in.
[268:03.28]And then push it into the wall.
[268:04.56]So it's not in the way.
[268:09.42]There we go.
[268:13.70]I hate this, whatever it is.
[268:14.90]I don't like it at all.
[268:16.86]Alright, now what else?

[268:33.31]Sink.
[268:47.22]Is this a public bathroom?
[268:53.56]I know there's a sink already, but I have to do it.
[268:57.09]So I'm going to be like, you know, I really wish there were two sinks in there.
[268:59.98]I don't want to complain or anything.
[269:14.22]Two sinks and a half bath.
[269:17.75]This isn't a half bath.
[269:19.35]This is a full bath.
[269:21.11]This is a double bath, actually.
[269:27.38]What are you doing?
[269:27.90]Let's go.

[281:34.81]Alright, the joke is over.
[281:37.41]Let's go with a... Purple.
[281:41.07]Purple quartz.
[281:42.31]That's a good baby room.
[281:51.10]Somebody's going to go up there and they're going to say, Oh, wow, look, a nice place to put my baby.
[281:54.68]Put a couple of stuffed animals in here.
[282:00.82]That's all she wrote.
[282:13.95]Lime green?
[282:14.53]No, not lime green.
[282:16.55]Which TV color?

[283:05.64]Alright, if this house makes a million dollars, I'm going to stream this game again.
[283:23.65]That's good.
[283:24.11]The baby needs to have a brighter floor than that.
[283:27.08]Alright, that's...
[283:47.87]I like it, actually.
[283:48.63]It kind of looks like the floor is covered in frosting.
[283:51.55]It's just a cake room.
[283:54.09]Have you tried my fudgicle cake?
[283:56.15]Uh, me likes.

[286:23.82]Baby room is done.
[286:25.26]The house is done.
[286:26.90]Let's just double check everything else.
[286:28.40]So we got front door here.
[286:31.67]We gotta get the mustard paint, though.
[286:34.33]No.
[286:35.03]No, you do it.
[286:39.23]What is it called?
[286:40.47]Peach?

[288:11.51]I don't know if I like that.
[288:12.57]Whatever.
[288:15.14]Okay, let's do a tour.
[288:16.44]We'll start with the normal house first.
[288:20.08]Make sure we get everything situated.
[288:21.26]Okay, so here we go.
[288:23.96]Close this up.
[288:24.74]You're not supposed to see this.
[288:28.33]Here's the house.
[288:31.85]And let's start it.
[288:33.37]Here's the front door.
[288:34.21]Front door opens.
[288:36.49]You got a nice little sofa here with a light.
[288:39.79]a painting from Gaspacho one of the most famous painters in the entire world or at least whoever you want to believe it we got a fireplace here that leads into the first room of this baby's room it's pretty nice I like the color everything looks clean
[289:04.80]Baby's room, that's the first one.
[289:06.84]Because everyone can have access to it, obviously.
[289:08.56]If you're on the couch and you hear the baby crying, ah, gotta get up and get that baby.
[289:11.76]Watching TV, you can hear the baby crying.
[289:13.28]Oh, yeah, you know, you understand.
[289:15.88]Out here, we got the first walkway to... Oh, this is kind of dirty, though.
[289:20.51]Can I do anything about this?
[289:23.61]I think this is just the way it is.
[289:26.01]Yeah, it is.
[289:27.13]Got a pool out there.
[289:27.93]That's fine.
[289:28.61]Close that up.
[289:31.33]Typical kitchen.
[289:32.35]Sponsored Coca-Cola soda fridge.
[289:34.89]Because I'm a Twitch streamer, so I have to have one of those.
[289:39.86]Washer, dryer, gas stove combo.
[289:44.96]Window to outlook the neighbor's yard.
[289:47.58]Yeah, neighbor's house.
[289:50.03]Took this photo when I was on vacation.
[289:52.72]Here is your... This is an oven with... I don't even know how this is an oven.
[289:58.66]This looks like a wooden safe.
[290:00.80]Looks like a four-digit password lock.
[290:02.86]Whatever.
[290:04.04]Here's the bathroom.
[290:05.60]Pretty... Silly.
[290:09.62]Oh!
[290:10.42]Oh, I'm sorry, folks.
[290:12.22]I'm sorry about this.
[290:13.50]I didn't know that was there.
[290:14.84]I didn't expect that.
[290:17.78]Good thing we did that.
[290:28.37]Oh, yeah.
[290:28.67]It's because I had to move that.
[290:29.83]Right.
[290:35.97]Not buying.
[290:36.67]I will call the owner immediately.
[290:45.26]God, this room tastes so good.
[290:49.29]Perfect.
[290:49.87]Okay.
[290:51.73]Standard double sink.
[290:55.61]Hot rack.
[290:56.85]Toilet.
[290:57.71]Bath.
[290:58.99]You know.
[291:00.47]Recently renovated.
[291:01.39]This was recently updated.
[291:02.69]New bathtub.
[291:06.57]And that's the house.
[291:07.59]Okay, now you, like, teleport to, like, another showing.
[291:17.38]Alright, so, like... No, not another showing.
[291:19.48]That's the house.
[291:20.46]That's it.
[291:23.64]And then they move in.
[291:25.47]And then the dad... This is what dad did behind everybody's back.
[291:31.47]Garage door.
[291:38.02]Garage door opens.
[291:39.56]Here's his parking spot.
[291:41.50]Bed right here.
[291:42.14]Doesn't need to wake anybody up.
[291:43.02]He can just pull in.
[291:43.94]No one will know he's there.
[291:44.82]Sleeps in the bed.
[291:45.52]His favorite color is blue.
[291:48.51]This closes up complete privacy.
[291:50.40]We talked about why a garage, people are out of their fucking minds and they just waste all their space in the garage with useless garbage and they want to make a bedroom, want to make a nice place.
[291:59.33]Here's the first bathroom, first dad bathroom.
[292:23.51]You can get out of there.
[292:27.58]That leads us to, obviously, he's got a shelf over here in case you need anything.
[292:33.86]first room over here in the pretend house that dad built without anybody knowing just general supplies a safe bunch of water because I mean he makes must make sure nobody knows he's here plenty of food in his food bucket leads him out into his secondary room this is his living room with his two tvs his privacy door which leads him out to the pool also he will make sure that the kids are at school and the wife is at work before he goes back there
[293:02.53]Leads into this room over here.
[293:04.41]Which is the... Oh, this is the Coup de grâce.
[293:07.12]As you can see, this is the actual man cave.
[293:10.30]This is where he spies on his family and plays Quake 2.
[293:13.00]Of course, he's got all these cool posters.
[293:17.05]Generator, because he doesn't have electricity in here.
[293:21.55]Some snacks over there.
[293:22.97]The Bible.
[293:25.83]And that's the whole house.
[293:28.55]For one second, I thought this was looking outside.
[293:30.73]And I was trying to figure out how the fuck that was possible.
[293:35.75]Because there's no... Like, look.
[293:37.76]What?
[293:39.84]I'm ready to sell.
[293:46.16]Let's see what we can get.
[293:46.82]Does the whole rest of the family sleep on couches?
[293:54.18]Uh...
[293:59.15]Hold on, let me see.
[294:02.67]Let me see that criticism of the... Oh, wait, I have to go in the actual house.
[294:07.05]There's no kitchen sink.
[294:07.93]Alright, look.
[294:10.21]Looks like it's got everything but the kitchen sink.
[294:14.75]Right, guys?
[294:15.19]That's what you were saying?
[294:16.45]Alright, so.
[294:17.59]I need a kitchen sink.
[294:19.06]There's no room for it.
[294:19.84]I can't put a sink in here.
[294:23.24]The sink won't function, but at least I can pretend like it works.
[294:25.58]Maybe I can sucker somebody into buying it.
[294:32.76]Alright, kitchen sink.
[294:37.28]Fridge.
[294:39.96]The kitchenette matches the living room.
[294:42.84]I'll cook meals for our whole family in there.
[294:44.74]Oh, okay.
[294:48.43]So he's saying we need more beds.
[294:54.85]Bathroom.
[294:57.05]Kitchen.

[295:10.02]That's possible.
[295:11.50]Baby.
[295:12.58]Dad.

[295:26.51]I need a mirror in the bathroom.
[295:34.12]I don't need a mirror in the bathroom.
[295:36.78]There's a mirror in the baby room.
[295:38.08]You can come here and like check yourself out, make sure you're alright.
[295:47.11]Oh fine, I'll put a mirror here.
[296:02.59]It's not perfect.
[296:10.53]That's so huge.
[296:15.37]Alright, I'm ready.
[296:17.03]Let's take a look at what we can get.
[296:18.35]Is this... I don't think I can... Wait, this is upside down.
[296:26.90]Right?
[296:28.48]No.
[296:33.28]No, okay, it doesn't matter.
[296:34.54]It doesn't matter.
[296:37.85]Alright.

[297:23.82]There are too many rooms.
[297:25.62]A big bedroom is another point for you.
[297:28.26]I prefer two types of things than those for babies.
[297:32.44]Why did you put them here?
[297:38.01]Okay, so... Here's the boomer, by the way.
[297:44.73]I want to rent this house to two people, so it would be great if they will have a place to sleep and elegant.

[299:39.12]Okay, hold on.
[299:40.90]Let's go down a little bit.
[299:41.82]93.
[299:42.78]115.
[299:42.90]Why is this $115,000?
[299:43.54]A bunker?
[299:43.94]Uncle's bunker.
[300:03.22]Here we go.
[300:03.72]These are the most expensive houses you can buy.
[300:05.46]161,000.
[300:07.50]188.
[300:07.62]Try to just buy the shack that has the bunker?
[300:22.21]A house with a bunker which belonged to an old pep- pepper?
[300:28.04]Pepper?
[300:28.84]Prepper?
[300:42.03]It is $115,000.
[300:42.27]What's that going on?
[300:49.12]Who's that?
[300:49.46]Okay.
[300:49.90]This is the aftermath of the previous house.
[301:11.36]This is what happens when dad has the place for like four years.
[301:15.54]And he just lets everything go and he doesn't give a fuck anymore.
[301:23.24]Oh, that's so funny.
[301:25.08]That is actually funny.
[301:32.11]So where's the bunker?
[301:34.01]How do I go down?
[301:36.77]Oh shit, really?
[301:37.85]This is cool.
[301:40.92]Look, jars are like shit and piss.
[301:46.71]Look, this is the room!
[301:48.35]I told you!
[301:50.19]It's gonna push the gas in here, like the cleansing gas.
[301:55.98]Holy shit.
[301:58.26]Oh my god, and there's a secret entrance?
[302:07.93]Like when you go into the cleansing spray.
[302:13.14]When you have a hazmat suit on it, it like sprays you.
[302:15.44]Hold to clean!
[302:16.32]Oh no, that's not what it was.
[302:21.98]When you close this thing and it goes like... And like all the antibacterial juices on you.
[302:31.27]Like Sandy's house from Spongebob, exactly.
[302:35.21]Oh, look at this.
[302:35.69]This is perfect.
[302:41.02]You are a person with castrophobia.
[302:43.67]If you're cockroaches, in the general game options, you can change cockroaches into pieces of glass.
[302:51.03]Wait, hold on.
[302:55.86]So wait, they actually have a... In the game, they have a option if you're scared of bugs.
[303:03.38]Huh.
[303:06.65]Ah, that's nice of them.
[303:10.26]Alright, I'm telling you right now.
[303:12.26]We're playing this again.
[303:19.18]I want to do this.
[303:20.00]We're playing this again.
[303:24.65]This game is too much fun.
[303:28.19]But, unfortunately, I gotta go.
[303:33.98]I have to eat dinner.
[303:35.92]And I've got a lot of shit to do tomorrow.
[303:37.50]So, unfortunately, we gotta go.
[303:43.16]So let me just reiterate one more time.
[303:44.68]The emote contest is not happening tonight.
[303:47.40]Didn't happen tonight, if you're curious.
[303:51.24]Tomorrow there's going to be no stream.
[303:53.34]So I can make sure I get it ready for Friday.
[303:56.48]There will be a stream Friday and there will be a stream on Saturday.
[304:00.34]So Friday, Saturday.
[304:03.04]See you then.
[304:03.94]Friday's the emote contest.
[304:08.43]But after that, I kind of think I want to go back and play this.
[304:12.45]It's scratching the itch from me again.
[304:13.73]This game's actually really fun.
[304:16.41]As weird and as strange as it is.
[304:22.44]Hold fast.
[304:22.80]Oh, we got hold fast too.
[304:23.82]I'm going to be playing that as well.

[309:54.26]Alright, so, bits, what do you say?
[310:01.63]I really didn't think I was gonna play that game ever again.

[310:07.59]You know, I'll just play it like once for, I played it for like eight hours one day, right?
[310:14.14]Something about that game, I don't know what it is.
[310:18.94]Okay, so let's go back to earlier tonight.

[313:19.61]Phew.

[313:29.27]Thank you, Andy.
[313:30.11]Appreciate the five bucks.
[313:32.10]Thanks a lot.
[313:38.83]uh thank you casey for the one dollar stream idea buy a razor scooter and film yourself doing sweet tricks you fall down we laugh we all win you can call it the jex games no I'm not getting on a razor scooter oh no I think a b is in here
[314:02.20]I have a story for you real quick.
[314:04.32]So there were guys here today that took a couch out of my basement because I have a lot of just random stuff that it needs to be to get rid of and it needs to be moved.
[314:14.54]So these guys got a couch
[314:16.95]It's a huge couch and they had to really get it out my back door.
[314:19.39]It was like really fucking difficult for them to do.
[314:22.05]So when they opened my back door and they started to push the couch out, there was apparently a beehive right next to the door.
[314:31.60]So when they opened the door, they started swarming these two guys.
[314:37.32]And I'm just standing in my house looking at the open door and bees swarming everywhere going into my house down here.
[314:44.93]And I'm just like, oh, this is not good.
[314:47.43]Are they going to be alright?
[314:49.59]And I did the thing that you kind of like, what am I going to do at that point, right?
[314:55.42]They're being swarmed with bees.
[314:57.20]Thankfully, neither of them got stung.
[314:59.12]I have no idea how they didn't get stung.
[315:01.36]It makes no sense.
[315:02.74]We're talking about like at least 40 bees were swarming these guys with this couch.
[315:07.29]And guess what?
[315:08.79]Talk about like good workers.
[315:10.21]They didn't even put the couch down.
[315:12.31]The guy was like, no, no, no, it's alright.
[315:13.55]It's alright, just keep going.
[315:14.39]Like, I got it.
[315:15.35]It's like, whoa, you have, alright.
[315:18.67]They didn't give a fuck.
[315:20.63]Didn't get stung at all.
[315:22.65]But my point is I was standing in the, inside the house looking out just, oh, hey, are you guys alright?
[315:30.59]Are you guys alright?
[315:32.33]Oh, there's bees everywhere.
[315:35.29]Are you guys okay?
[315:37.34]What am I supposed to do?
[315:39.76]That's all you can do, is just be like the bystanding idiot that can't do anything and just says that.
[315:46.88]Yeah, but there are a bunch of bees got in this room.
[315:51.53]Because it's right next to my back door.
[315:53.79]So there were probably like four bees in here.
[315:56.27]Like six hours ago.
[315:58.17]Seven hours ago.
[315:59.17]And I just heard one.
[316:01.09]Just like zoom by.
[316:02.31]I have no idea where he is now though.
[316:04.24]Anyways, we're fine.
[316:06.62]But yeah, that happened today.
[316:09.04]But thank you.
[316:09.40]Thank you YRTM for the 10 bucks here.
[316:12.74]Another opportunity to stream IRL fishing lost forever in the sands of time.
[316:19.24]Why do you want me to fish?
[316:20.90]I feel like that would be boring.
[316:24.16]Then again, I could say the same thing about flipping a house.
[316:27.99]But that was like fun.
[316:33.39]Maybe.
[316:34.33]Maybe one day.
[316:36.34]But thank you, Wire, for the ten bucks.
[316:37.56]Appreciate it.
[316:37.88]Thank you, Sticked Renegade, for the one dollar.
[316:39.28]Hey, Jeremy, you still don't remember, do you?

[317:08.73]Remind me.
[317:09.27]What did I forget?
[317:12.21]What did I do?
[317:18.30]When am I moving?
[317:19.94]In like five or six weeks, I will be completely moved in.
[317:24.62]Just under six weeks, I will be complete, totally 100% moved in.
[317:32.31]But thank you, Sticks.
[317:32.91]Remind me what I forgot.
[317:33.99]I got to figure it out.
[317:35.45]Okay, I'll try.
[317:38.25]Let me think.
[317:38.85]Hey Frextor, thanks for the one dollar.

[319:12.00]Hey, GetDunkedOn, thanks for the three bucks.
[319:13.48]Thanks for streaming this again, Jerma.
[319:14.56]This is legitimately the greatest form of entertainment on Earth.
[319:17.56]Greatest form of entertainment on Earth.
[319:18.98]I can't understate that.
[319:23.97]I have a great time when I play this game.
[319:26.95]For some weird... I don't know why.
[319:28.29]I just do.
[319:28.57]It's just relaxing, fun.
[319:31.93]It's good stuff.
[319:33.93]Thank you, GetDunkedOn.
[319:34.75]Thank you, Sly161, for the six dollars and fifty cents.
[319:38.33]Hey Jerma, donating this for my $100 bit badge.
[319:41.85]I've been subbed for over two years and not a cent feels wasted.
[319:45.99]Said it before but you're an inspiration that helped me handle being diagnosed with IBD stuff.
[319:53.27]Wish you the best with the move.
[319:54.50]Can't wait to see that Vegas content.
[319:58.60]Thank you, Sly.
[320:01.48]Really appreciate that.
[320:04.67]Thank you for being subbed and supporting this channel for two straight years.
[320:07.75]Thanks for being around for as long as you have.
[320:11.22]I know, like, people sub to the channels and, oh, yeah, alright, well, yeah, here's a sub.
[320:16.46]But that does blow my mind that there are a lot of people that stay subscribed for years.
[320:24.98]Thank you.
[320:28.38]You don't know what that means.
[320:29.72]That means a lot.
[320:32.70]Thank you, Sly.
[320:35.17]captain red life thanks for the one dollar heard about your situation with the toilet don't have much but take some bits and prime sub hope you have a good day happy birthday jerma thank you it is my birthday today oh that's what I forgot okay I'm 36. thank you thanks for coming out to my birthday party hey vats that's thanks for the one dollar before I moved into a new house my parents asked me and my siblings what color we wanted to paint our rooms
[321:01.90]I chose a gray color, but once I walked into my room for the first time, only one wall was painted gray, and the rest of the room was painted a different shade of gray.
[321:11.94]My parents only painted one wall the color we chose, so now my room has one gray wall that's a slightly different shade, and once you notice it, you can't unsee it, and it kills me every time I look at that wall.
[321:24.53]What, did you run out of paint?
[321:25.87]Did your parents run out of paint and just like, ah, shit.
[321:28.79]What was the color code on that one?
[321:31.49]Ah, gray.
[321:31.99]Just go get gray.
[321:33.77]Go walk into Home Depot and pick up a gray.
[321:37.34]That's funny, though.
[321:38.68]But yeah, I'm telling you, feng shui, that's kind of a real thing.
[321:45.32]Some places and some spaces and some colors just make you angry.
[321:49.35]And some ways that they're put together and the way that you look at furniture, it sucks.
[321:53.79]I can feel that.
[322:01.52]Hey, Captain Morgan, thanks for the $1.
[322:02.90]If you like garages so much, why don't you just live in one?
[322:06.54]Okay, fine.
[322:08.26]I will.
[322:08.46]I don't know, maybe like 40 years.
[322:14.67]Hey, Reaper, thanks for the $1.
[322:16.05]Carpet and bathroom tiles in the garage.
[322:19.23]If you were showing this off to people in real life, they would vomit upon seeing it.
[322:23.38]And then I would give them the spiel that I gave you guys, and it would turn their minds upside down.
[322:31.11]thank you thank you uh mega aggro for the three bucks have you thought about doing an irl House Flipper stream I there would be no content it'd be me like painting a wall I can't take a sledgehammer and smash down what no I can't do that you know it would actually be like really funny though and I don't even know the logistics and legality behind any of this
[322:53.92]But wouldn't that be really funny if I went and just bought, like, an absolute fucking dump somewhere?
[322:58.89]We're talking, like, a $41,000 house.
[323:02.95]Put it on a mortgage and just buy it.
[323:04.93]And then go in there and do, like, a stream of, like, a fake, like... And we're here at Fix It Up!
[323:12.35]And we try to fix the house in, like, a two-day stream period.
[323:16.47]Really, like, actually try to fix the house on stream.
[323:23.46]I don't know what I'm doing.
[323:24.18]I have no idea what I'm doing.
[323:26.74]Bring in like at least one person that has knowledge of like, okay, so that's the gas line.
[323:31.96]Don't fucking touch that.
[323:34.38]Have like one guy that knows what he's doing.
[323:36.38]And then like three dickheads and try to fix the house.
[323:42.28]That would be dreadfully unfun for you.
[323:46.98]I see a power tool injury in your future.
[323:58.08]try to get like like a dozen people to fix it that's how you die no we'd have like the proper safety equipment I'd be in a suit of armor dude I mean like oh yeah everyone's really concerned that I might get hurt but not with this suit of armor on I'll have a full suit of armor on then what's gonna happen to me I'm not gonna get hurt
[324:24.80]ring mail no it would be plate mail we're talking like 400 pound plate mail it's gonna have to give me like four people that have to help me walk around get like electrocuted no electrical would be turned off we wouldn't actually make it like any electrical systems or plumbing we would just try to fix up the house and put in furniture like a video game
[324:54.18]I actually like that idea a lot.
[324:58.46]Something about that is just doing it for me for some reason.
[325:05.37]Oh, we need to put a pool back here.
[325:06.81]I'll think about that.
[325:10.95]Hold on to that one.
[325:13.54]But thank you, too.
[325:15.14]Mega aggro for the three bucks.
[325:16.74]Thank you, justthatguy1121 for the one dollar.
[325:19.60]Jeremy, you wonderful meme boy.
[325:21.32]Keep on doing what you do.
[325:23.06]By the way, you know you can import your own images for the paintings in the game.
[325:27.83]Yeah, I know.
[325:28.21]I just kind of got locked in the zone there and didn't really do it.
[325:33.53]But we will play that again.
[325:36.53]Soon.
[325:36.93]Very soon.
[325:38.65]It's been like a month or two since I played it last and I got that itch again for it.
[325:42.43]It's just a fun, stupid game.
[325:45.37]But thank you, JustThatGuy.
[325:46.59]Thank you to TechnoToast for the $1.
[325:49.91]I hope this Dad Lives in the Walls plot is actually the plot line for Rat Movie 3.
[325:57.20]No, you guys already know the plot for Rat Movie 3.
[325:58.88]I've already talked about it.
[326:02.08]I already talked about the Half-Life 3 leaked script.
[326:07.57]CookieCRM, thanks for the $50 earlier.
[326:09.97]Again, let's touch upon it.
[326:10.97]Thank you so much.
[326:14.39]Thank you.
[326:16.11]You're too kind.
[326:19.49]When?
[326:20.37]I did.
[326:20.59]It was the sponsor thing.
[326:22.85]Like, I was gonna try to get, like, 30 sponsors in the video.
[326:27.89]Remember when we talked about this already?
[326:33.12]I was gonna try to get, like, Colgate toothpaste and every, like, frozen food item all in the same video.
[326:41.43]The rats, like, have sold out.
[326:42.98]They have, like, an actual, like, mixtape.
[326:45.18]They have songs.
[326:49.10]I talked about this, like, a year ago.
[326:58.11]You could do that with fake companies.
[327:00.13]Well, I didn't want to do it with fake companies, because the fact that it was real was funny to me.
[327:04.33]The fact that there were going to be, like, 20 to 30 sponsors in the video, and, like, they all wouldn't have even known...
[327:10.25]That's why I, like, stopped and thought about it again.
[327:13.34]Because, like, how funny is that that, like, Colgate thinks they're getting, like, a sponsor video.
[327:18.76]They are.
[327:19.60]But, like, also, so is, like, Celeste Frozen Pizzas in the same video.
[327:31.13]It's funnier if the sponsors are real.
[327:32.67]Yeah, that's... If it's really happening, that makes it funny.
[327:36.51]If it's not actually happening, then it's just me taking the piss out of something.
[327:42.57]include competitors yeah like they're drinking like all the different sodas at the same time they pour them all in the same glass that was one of the things like a coke Pepsi and rc cola all of them go in the same glass and then they go I'm not sure which one of these is the best one there are I don't know one of these in here is definitely very good
[328:15.52]If only there was a way we could figure out how.
[328:22.32]Kids, soda rots your brain.
[328:23.58]It does.
[328:25.36]But thank you to TechnoToast.
[328:27.18]Thank you to CookieCRM again for the 50 bucks.
[328:30.37]Mostly lost.
[328:30.97]Thanks for the $1.
[328:31.83]Jerma, you were fucking weird when you were 11.
[328:34.93]Can you find me an 11-year-old that's not weird?
[328:40.50]I think you'd have a tough time.
[328:43.77]Well, I can't believe the things that you say when you're 11, 12, 13.
[328:45.89]Hm.
[328:46.29]What do you mean, me?
[328:58.16]Can you control RC Cola with a remote control?
[329:00.25]No.
[329:10.46]Those 11-year-olds need to grow up.
[329:12.88]No, you don't have to grow up until you're at least, like, 25.
[329:18.12]Don't listen to what anybody ever tells you.
[329:20.48]You don't actually grow up until you're in your, like, mid-20s.
[329:24.56]Trust me.
[329:25.14]I already did it.
[329:30.66]Goddammit, I'm 26.
[329:31.94]Uh-oh.
[329:33.68]I'm 32.
[329:35.36]So don't worry.
[329:36.48]We're all here together.
[329:44.27]Honestly, the way that the world is right now... I think that the... You should be an adult at 18, right?
[329:53.00]Like, you're an adult.
[329:54.20]But you should be an A- adult when you're 25.
[330:00.00]And the A stands for actually.
[330:03.04]Yes, you're 18, you're an adult, but you're not an A- adult yet.
[330:06.18]You're not an A-.
[330:07.66]You're not an actual adult yet.
[330:13.06]I wasn't a fucking adult until I was at least 24, 25, 26.
[330:15.10]No, you're not an A dash.
[330:26.29]Like this.
[330:38.49]B adult.
[330:39.01]No, you're not an A dash.
[330:40.77]Until you're 25.
[330:44.87]But anyways, thank you.
[330:47.99]To... Hey, Dr. Forever, thanks for the $1.
[330:52.63]Let's give a quick shout-out to Christina Applegate.
[330:55.81]We had this... This is something from the internet or from a television or movie or something.
[331:02.15]Thank you.
[331:02.43]Mostly lost for the $1.
[331:04.27]R.I.P.
[331:04.59]Dad.
[331:04.93]He died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
[331:13.47]You wouldn't keep the car on.
[331:15.15]What are you?
[331:17.65]I'm not going to pull into the garage and like, oh, the keys are still in there and the engines on time to get out of the car and go to bed.
[331:26.89]What are you talking about?
[331:27.79]Warm the car up before work.
[331:41.63]But if it's Frostio, then you pull it out of the garage.
[331:45.43]You turn the car on, pull it out of the garage, get out of the car and go back into the bed.
[331:49.47]Jesus Christ.
[332:00.40]Alright, alright, alright.
[332:02.02]Thank you, Stix Renegade, for the $1.
[332:05.00]We're all dying to know.
[332:07.64]Where do you sneeze?
[332:08.88]I find sneezing inside your shirt through the neck hole is the best way.
[332:13.97]All the spray stays out of sight.
[332:15.61]You might have a slimy wet chest, but at least your hands are fine.
[332:19.25]Well, there's a couple of scenarios here that you need to know.
[332:23.05]Scenario one.
[332:24.09]Well, let's break them down.
[332:25.01]Are you around somebody else?
[332:27.64]Right?
[332:28.14]Is there at least... What is your relationship to this person?
[332:32.13]Are you in public?
[332:33.71]There are lots of different ways to sneeze by how many humans are in close proximity of your body, right?
[332:40.34]Alone in a room?
[332:41.92]That shit goes straight in the ear.
[332:43.50]I don't even cover my mouth.
[332:44.90]I don't do anything.
[332:46.18]If I'm just alone sitting here, bang, it just shotguns out of my mouth and my face directly in front of me.
[332:52.86]I don't give a fuck at all.
[332:55.62]If there is another person around me,
[332:59.82]what my relationship to that person is.
[333:01.14]If I'm close, close friend, in a relationship with this person, then instead of going directly out, I calculate really quickly exactly where they are.
[333:12.09]For instance, okay, person to my left.
[333:15.25]Alright, analyze it, calculated it, and I sneeze really loudly over to the right.
[333:20.34]I turn my head, bang, shotgun to the right.
[333:24.32]In every other scenario,
[333:27.72]I hold the sneeze in until it is absolutely fucking painful and it might kill me.
[333:35.59]I would rather, like, die holding in a sneeze than do it in public.
[333:43.20]Those are the only three ways to sneeze.
[333:44.44]You know what I'm talking about.
[333:46.88]That, like, oh fuck, here it comes.
[333:52.50]And sometimes you try to do that and it makes it way worse and you sneeze way louder.
[334:00.13]Those are the only three ways to do it.
[334:09.18]That might legitimately kill you.
[334:10.98]No, it won't.
[334:15.82]Can you die from holding in a sneeze?
[334:17.12]This reminds me of one time when I searched, can you die by eating a whole jar of peanut butter?
[334:24.53]Can you die by holding in a sneeze?
[334:39.65]Ah!
[334:40.97]This pressurized air will travel back through the ears, eustachian tubes, and into the middle ear where it could cause damage, such as a ruptured eardrum.
[334:50.92]Holding in a sneeze could affect more than your ears.
[334:54.02]Stifled sneezes have caused blood vessels to break in the eyes and result in spells of incontinence.
[335:09.41]Alright!
[335:11.29]So you can- I'll make sure I s- uh, but how do I do it?
[335:15.39]I can't.
[335:15.93]I- socially, I can't do it.
[335:17.71]It's unacceptable for me.
[335:18.85]I can't.
[335:21.92]Should I pretend I'm screaming somebody's name?
[335:24.06]Cause that's acceptable to me.
[335:25.34]If I'm like, far away from somebody, or if like, Hey!
[335:28.00]Hey, like, Danny!
[335:29.40]Danny!
[335:30.34]Should I just like, pretend I'm screaming at somebody?
[335:31.74]Cause I'm okay with that, doing that in public.
[335:33.28]So should I be like, Danny!
[335:36.10]Like, will that- is that alright?
[335:42.35]Because actually, that would work for me.
[335:50.11]That makes me sound insane.
[335:51.53]But at least people will know that I'm not sneezing.
[335:53.73]It's disgusting.
[335:54.81]Unbearable.
[335:55.58]No, I don't want to do that.
[335:56.60]I'll scream Danny's name.
[335:57.70]Anyways, thank you.
[336:04.76]Thank you to... Where are we?
[336:07.86]Where are we?
[336:08.30]Where are we?
[336:11.77]Where are we?
[336:12.89]Here we are.
[336:15.52]Uh, thank you to Stix, by the way, for that.
[336:18.68]Sneeze Conversations.
[336:19.66]Thank you Imseldom for the five dollars.
[336:22.41]I subscribed to Jerma when I witnessed his amazing PUBG mobile victory.
[336:26.05]I have since learned his opponents were all bots.
[336:28.27]I fell for the fake news and I'm ashamed.
[336:31.97]That's not true.
[336:34.37]The bots are in those games until about level 10 or rank 10.
[336:38.63]I was rank 13 or 14 when playing that game.
[336:40.82]Bots are still kind of there, but they are weaned out from rank 10 onwards.
[336:46.64]So maybe there'll be 20 to 15 bots in a game past rank 10.
[336:51.31]Fake news dispelled.
[336:55.37]I was rank 14 on that stream.
[336:57.76]Go look.
[336:58.54]It's available for the internet.
[337:00.06]You can see it.
[337:03.62]You said you were rank 10.
[337:04.58]That's not true.
[337:05.80]I said I thought I was rank 10 because I thought I was rank 10, but I was rank 14.
[337:09.36]Go check the VOD.
[337:11.40]Take a look.
[337:12.49]The internet can't lie.
[337:16.05]Well, I mean, people can lie on the internet, but you can't lie about factual data that's on the internet.
[337:20.45]It's there forever.
[337:22.82]If I sneeze, then you can go back and watch it a million times.
[337:25.62]It's there forever.
[337:26.74]Me being 14 is there forever.
[337:27.94]Go look.
[337:31.30]You've been live for over six hours, and by this point in your broadcast, you should have consumed at least 24 ounces of bleach.
[337:37.04]What?
[337:37.28]What the fuck, Hydratebot?
[337:38.49]Don't tell people that.
[337:39.27]What's wrong with you?
[337:48.29]You're 14.
[337:51.27]Thank you to GetDunkedOn again for the $1.
[337:54.25]Can we talk about how good William Shatner looks for his age?
[337:56.71]Dude, he's almost 90.
[337:59.73]But he looks 50.
[338:00.79]William Shatner is 90?
[338:01.95]No, he's not.
[338:12.02]William Shatner is 90?
[338:15.10]Oh my god.
[338:16.82]He's 80 fucking 7.

[339:15.10]Hey, Flying Sombrero, thanks for the $1.
[339:16.48]Hey, Jeremy, first time giving bits, so I hope I do this right.
[339:19.62]Me and my friend have been fans since high school, and your humor has shaped ours.
[339:24.47]I want to thank you for all you've given us, and can't wait to see more from you.
[339:28.39]Expect more bits from me in the future.
[339:29.85]I owe you all for the effort you put into your content for us.
[339:36.40]I've told this to a lot of people, but first of all, thank you.
[339:38.62]Second of all, you don't owe me anything.
[339:40.62]If anything, I owe you.
[339:42.58]I owe you guys.
[339:44.24]Not the other way around.
[339:47.82]Again, you guys have allowed me to do something I never have thought possible.
[339:52.66]You let me live a comfortable fucking life doing something that I love to do.
[339:58.20]So, thank you.
[340:01.77]I owe you for this shit.
[340:05.77]Thank you.
[340:10.33]Don't ever forget that.
[340:12.41]But thank you, Flying Sombrero.
[340:13.63]I look forward to seeing you around.
[340:17.15]Hey Spreeo, thanks for the $1.05.
[340:19.73]Here's another fact about seagulls brought to you by Seagull Savers Association.
[340:24.05]Seagulls are expert flyers.
[340:25.37]They have mastered control of air and wind.
[340:28.35]They help to turn the shape directional changes in the air.
[340:32.53]In addition to that, the reason why they smash into buildings all the time and directly into the glass is because they're so stupid and their brains are one third smaller than that of a field mouse.
[340:44.24]Oh, interesting.
[340:45.12]Okay.
[340:49.13]I didn't know that.
[340:49.59]That's an interesting fact.
[340:53.59]Thank you, Sprio, for that seagull fact, yeah.
[341:00.04]Hey, Flying Sombrero, thanks for the $1.
[341:01.26]Hey, here's a second donation to the cause, Jerma.
[341:06.14]I got a job recently in Kanoa.
[341:08.27]I can now afford to pay you the minimum amount of bits to read this.
[341:11.19]I want to see a picture of my cat.
[341:13.15]I would love it.
[341:14.05]He likes to watch your streams with me.
[341:15.43]His name is Ratatouille.
[341:18.35]Because he looks like a rat.
[341:22.89]Oh, look at this little rat cat.
[341:27.11]That's a cute cat.
[341:28.91]Here, everybody else needs to see this cat.
[341:34.99]A cute little ratatouille cat.
[341:36.99]Thank you, Flying Sombrero.
[341:39.69]Cute cat.
[341:43.57]Uh, Talamaka, thanks for the one dollar.
[341:45.13]Order an egg.
[341:46.95]Okay, Talamaka, thanks for the dollar.
[341:48.41]Two dollars, actually, here.
[341:49.51]Three in a row.
[341:51.05]Uh, Google order an egg.
[341:53.67]Google order egg.
[341:56.46]Google.com egg.
[341:58.24]What is this?
[341:59.42]I don't have any of those robots that do things for you when you talk.
[342:03.00]That's not gonna happen to me.
[342:05.32]I know, like, you might have, like, seen another streamer that goes, like, like, Alexa!
[342:11.01]Thanks for the four dollars.
[342:12.05]Alexa, order, uh, hot Cheetos!
[342:14.81]Okay, but I don't have one of those.
[342:20.94]I will never own one of those.
[342:23.08]So... I'm going to Google it right now.
[342:26.28]I'm going to Google order egg.
[342:28.56]Because I'm a person and I don't need a robot to do things for me.
[342:31.47]So let's see.
[342:31.99]Google order egg.
[342:37.67]How to order eggs.
[342:39.77]Your egg ordering guide.
[342:44.10]Just kind of where to order eggs for you.
[342:47.10]I guess.
[342:49.20]I guess.
[342:50.66]But, uh, thank you.
[342:52.54]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[342:53.96]I found footage of chat during the emote contest.
[343:14.11]You think that, but... Remember, I did a first pass on these emotes.
[343:20.25]Some were not applicable to the current state of the channel and have been potentially removed or not removed due to contrast issues with the background or being shown up in a way that it did not conflict with the channel's view sets.
[343:35.92]Okay.
[343:38.70]Thank you, Katalamaka, again, for the $2.00.
[343:43.13]Excuse me, can I speak to Google?
[343:44.61]I need eggs.
[343:46.07]And then he says, Cracker Barrel.
[343:47.53]Cracker Bagel.
[343:49.43]Barbel.
[343:49.76]What is this?
[343:52.58]Are you pretending to be like an old person at an ATM?
[343:54.90]I don't know what this joke is.
[344:02.75]Uh, thank you.
[344:05.75]Thank you for real dough for the five dollars.
[344:07.15]Are you going to give up on prototype or are you still going to try to get it to run decently?
[344:11.55]There appears to be some people who got it to run on four cores.
[344:15.31]I have six cores, unfortunately.
[344:17.52]But, is it available on PSN?
[344:21.38]Is it on PS Now?
[344:24.22]Anybody know?
[344:25.12]Offhand?
[344:26.14]If I can play that on PS4?
[344:27.42]Or do I need to get that on PlayStation 3?
[344:34.45]Maybe.
[344:34.69]I think so.
[344:36.77]We'll try it.
[344:39.93]But thank you, For Real Dough, for the five bucks.
[344:41.79]I definitely don't want to give up on that.
[344:44.75]I would need the PlayStation 3.
[344:46.43]That game seems like a lot of fun, so... I will try to get that to work again.
[344:51.98]Thank you, HoleOfOneZombie, for the one dollar.
[344:53.64]Top 100 Faded Lemon Streamer.
[344:56.50]I don't know what that's a reference to, but thank you.
[345:01.45]HoleOfOneZombie again for the one dollar.
[345:02.85]Here's a dollar so you can get some raw bees for dinner.
[345:06.65]Just cook them down into some nice honey.
[345:14.65]I don't know where you guys pull out some of this shit.
[345:17.25]Where is this from?
[345:21.03]Hey, thank you Asian turtle for the dollar.
[345:22.98]Oh one.
[345:23.52]I covered the rest of mostly lost donation.
[345:25.70]Read it.
[345:27.26]Okay, so most of the loss gave 99 cents, and he got one cent from Asian Turtle, so that makes him have one dollar.
[345:33.58]J.A.
[345:33.88]Daly, check to see if he reads this, and I did, because that was 99 cents, and you've been brought in to the door.
[345:40.96]So thank you, most of the loss.
[345:41.90]Thank you, Asian Turtle.
[345:43.40]And thank you, Ratuna, for the one dollar.
[345:45.10]This is another stream that I was in tears from laughing.
[345:47.66]My face also hurts from laughing so much.
[345:49.84]Thanks for the awesome stream.
[345:50.68]And here's another dollar for the water for Vegas Fund.
[345:53.72]Thank you.
[345:56.27]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[345:58.31]Glad you had fun.
[345:59.23]It was a good time.
[346:01.51]Noodle Pickles, thanks for the $1.
[346:02.89]He says... What do you guys think it is?
[346:04.99]Don't look.
[346:05.31]No, don't look back.
[346:06.01]What does Noodle Pickles have to say?
[346:09.54]$1.
[346:09.56]What does it say?
[346:15.20]No, it does not say egg.
[346:16.38]No.
[346:18.92]No.
[346:20.30]No, come on.
[346:22.41]Come on.
[346:25.11]Ah, somebody got it.
[346:26.11]Poopoo Peepy.
[346:28.48]Thank you.
[346:30.40]Hey, snooze!
[346:31.12]Thanks for the $1 snooze.
[346:32.84]Speaking of bees, one time I came home and laid down and heard a buzzing and saw a bee right by my head on my pillow.
[346:38.98]I left my room immediately and closed the door.
[346:41.56]Later I went back in and looked everywhere for it but couldn't find it.
[346:45.19]So I went to bed and the next morning I found it on the floor so I guess I had my slumber party with a bee.
[346:53.57]Okay, I thought that was going to go real dark.
[346:55.61]I thought you were going to say it went into your mouth.
[346:58.27]And like stung inside your mouth when you were sleeping.
[347:01.45]But hey, you just hung out with a bee.
[347:03.75]That's pretty cool.
[347:05.05]That's good, right?
[347:05.69]That's better.
[347:09.29]Well, thank you, Snooze.
[347:09.95]I'm glad you had fun with that bee.
[347:11.03]Thank you.
[347:11.37]Mostly lost for the one dollar.
[347:13.57]Well, we're all sharing bee stories when I was... Well, hold on a minute.
[347:17.13]Like two of us did.
[347:19.68]You got two bee stories here.
[347:24.69]Thanks.
[347:25.35]Thanks for the $1 mostly lost.
[347:26.63]Hey, while we're all sharing bee stories, when I was three, we were out playing on the playground and there were these clumps of like 20 bees huddled on the playground and genius me decided to put my hands on one clump.
[347:39.64]It took until a few years ago to get over my fear of bees.
[347:46.32]What happened to you?
[347:47.07]Did you get stung?
[347:47.83]That sounds pretty fucking terrible.
[347:53.24]Thank you, though, man.
[347:53.86]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer for the $1.

[348:31.50]Click.
[348:31.84]Garfield comes in again.
[348:32.78]This guy's gotta stop at some point.
[348:34.42]Click.
[348:34.82]Can we ban Garfield?
[348:37.90]Do you like being hated by chat?
[348:40.22]Well, I wouldn't say I dislike it.
[348:49.29]Now, okay, I got, I'm not gonna do this, but this is like the real, the real like dick in me.
[348:57.03]You know, like what, what if I was like, it's still a dollar, but all Garfield's bits have to be ten dollars to be read.
[349:11.12]It's the same rule applies, but Garfield's bits have to be twenty-five dollars.

[353:13.99]Probably one of the True Crimes.
[353:15.19]That was so much fun.
[353:16.58]Those True Crime games were fucking hilarious and just a ton of fun to play.
[353:23.16]Or some PSVR stuff.
[353:24.38]It was just so much fun being in the VR and doing dumb shit.
[353:29.65]The movies.
[353:30.25]Yeah, the movies is probably up there too in the top five most fun I've ever had on stream.
[353:38.57]Sorcery.
[353:40.84]Yeah.
[353:41.88]It probably would be sorcery because that was just like one of the first major streams I really ever did.
[353:50.20]No, that was a lot of fun.
[353:51.24]There's too many to name.
[353:54.70]We tend to have a lot of fun here, so.
[353:56.96]We tend to have a lot of fun here, guys.
[353:59.34]It's hard to pinpoint one specific thing.
[354:05.00]That's tough, but thanks, Bob.
[354:07.52]Thanks for the doll.
[354:09.14]Jesus.
[354:09.42]That sounds like a lot.
[354:10.20]That sounds like a lot of bees.
[354:11.24]To lock down a school.
[354:11.91]Were there like a thousand?
[354:12.87]But, thank you burnt muffins.
[354:13.73]I think you'd enjoy it.
[354:14.35]Probably not.
[354:40.15]What did me and Etalyx try to play?
[354:41.90]Oh, that's Far Cry 5.
[354:45.52]These games are all the same video game.
[354:47.58]Just Cause and Far Cry are the same game in my brain.
[354:50.90]And I can't get rid of that.
[354:51.76]I don't know.
[354:58.35]I can't see them as separate things.
[355:03.93]Even if it's completely irrational, I don't know why it is.
[355:08.85]But thank you, MostlyLost.
[355:09.81]Thank you, MostlyLost, again.
[355:10.83]Hey, Jerma, it's my friend Styx's birthday today.
[355:13.21]Can you wish him a happy birthday for me?
[355:14.75]See, I told you I didn't forget.
[355:16.58]Happy birthday, Styx.
[355:18.86]And last but not least, finally, JadeSnake.
[355:21.02]Thanks for the $10, JaneSnake.
[355:23.56]And JadeSnake says, Hi, Jerma, I just wanted to say I hope your move goes well.
[355:27.68]I recently moved nine hours away from my hometown, and it was a little scary at first being far away from my family, but so far I feel like it was really worth it.
[355:36.67]Hope it's the same way for you.
[355:39.07]But Jade Snake, that is very encouraging.
[355:42.80]Because this will be the first time that I am living in a sort of permanent residence more than three to four hours away from my, like, hometown area.
[355:57.67]So this is going to be a major change.
[355:58.89]It's going to take a little bit of getting used to, but I'm going with... Again, we talked about this a little bit briefly, but, you know...
[356:08.17]My girlfriend's going to be there.
[356:10.24]My dog's going to be there.
[356:11.56]One of my good friends is going to be there.
[356:12.84]Like, Etalyx is going.
[356:14.04]It's... That dampens the blow a little bit.
[356:18.44]So... I think I'll have hopefully an easy time to do.
[356:22.43]But it should be fun.
[356:28.28]Is my dad going to be in the walls?
[356:29.52]I'm not sure.
[356:30.02]All I know is that this place that we're moving to is getting a lot of construction work done to it.
[356:34.87]And it's weird because my father has not been around.
[356:38.81]He's been traveling a lot.
[356:40.89]I don't know why.
[356:41.61]He said he was doing it for some work or something.
[356:44.60]But he's been bringing a lot of tools with him.
[356:45.96]I'm not sure.
[356:46.40]I don't think it's related.
[356:51.16]night guys I'll see you guys on Friday for the emote contest Friday 7 p.m we'll have a lot of fun it'll be ready no stream tomorrow good night have a good one take care you
[357:25.76]Thank you.
