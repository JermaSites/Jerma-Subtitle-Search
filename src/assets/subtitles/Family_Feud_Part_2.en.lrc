[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.56]I didn't think I would be installing this game right now, so... We are in the meantime.
[00:09.49]I don't know.
[00:10.09]We might have to do something else.
[00:16.59]There's still like an update.
[00:18.16]I wish Hitman would work.
[00:20.68]Can I do the Christmas mission on Hitman still?
[00:26.18]Should I try the Christmas mission again?
[00:34.01]comb stream play chess milk stream Hollow Knight I could open Hollow Knight but I feel like I haven't played it in a week and I need to like we'll see I'm gonna try to do the hitman mission the hitman um Christmas mission Christmas is here early there's a free bayonetta game is there really
[01:04.39]Yeah, sorry, I really, really expected that that game was going to be at least, like, a couple hours.
[01:08.53]I thought I was going to get at least, like, two or three hours of content from FlatOut4.
[01:12.67]And, uh... No.
[01:15.75]No, I didn't.
[01:16.97]No.
[01:19.75]So.
[01:20.91]I wonder if the... Remember when I did this last time, it, like, broke my game?
[01:26.83]Like, my computer couldn't handle it.
[01:30.81]Christmas has never ended.
[01:32.87]Can I even do...
[01:36.12]Does anybody know if the Christmas mission is still there?
[01:41.02]No, no Hollow Knight.
[01:41.72]I'm not going to do Hollow Knight.
[01:43.92]I just don't want an hour and ten minute stream.
[01:48.25]I'd rather play anything else for the next hour or so.
[01:53.17]Because I was not prepared to have to stop playing flat out because it was nothing to do.
[01:59.23]But...
[02:03.13]Where we at for Lego City Undercover?
[02:04.98]It just needs to download.
[02:05.96]But hopefully in the meantime when I play Hitman, I'm playing like one thing in Hitman.
[02:10.22]Should be ready to go.
[02:14.06]Family Feud?
[02:14.56]I could actually do Family Feud right now.
[02:16.64]Yeah, let's do that.
[02:18.63]That is always fucking fun.
[02:20.71]The shitty SNES Family Feud.
[02:24.41]We'll do that.
[02:26.77]Until like Hitman's ready.
[02:30.58]Christmas is not a season, it's a way of life.
[02:32.84]Alright, well, give me a second.
[02:35.02]I'm gonna get that set up.
[02:35.80]We're gonna play Family Feud for, like, 20 or 30 minutes.
[02:37.92]Oh, actually... Hitman's, like, pretty much done.
[02:49.20]Alright, I'll give you this.
[02:50.86]If the Hitman mission don't fucking work, then we're going back to the bumps.
[02:55.71]And I'll do Family Feud.
[02:56.71]But if Hitman works, then we'll play it.
[03:04.26]And then we'll play LEGO City Undercover tomorrow.
[03:07.14]Or later tonight.
[03:07.88]We'll see how long this takes.
[03:08.94]I really, really wish it would just fucking download though.
[03:17.14]Poll for Spore.
[03:22.33]How does SNES Family Feud work?
[03:24.93]It's just the computer.
[03:25.97]The computer has like a set thing of guesses.
[03:27.99]I really don't understand how it works.
[03:29.43]I really don't.
[03:31.69]Because wouldn't it just guess correctly every time?
[03:34.77]It's really weird.
[03:37.97]You know what?
[03:38.53]Here.
[03:39.03]Here you go, guys.
[03:39.61]Here you go.
[03:41.71]You guys want a straw poll?
[03:42.61]You'll get one.
[03:44.79]Here's your straw poll.
[03:46.49]We need to go... Hitman.
[03:57.10]Hitman and fucking HaHa.
[04:01.85]Or... Uh... Feud.
[04:08.52]Haha.
[04:09.78]Alright, which one of these haha's do you guys want to do, you think?
[04:12.68]Here we go.
[04:16.54]There you go.
[04:16.98]There's your Hitman haha or Feud haha.
[04:22.21]What would you guys rather see?
[04:32.02]No spore?
[04:32.58]No, no spore.
[04:34.28]Not today.
[04:35.72]Oh, it looks like, it looks like Feud is currently, actually, maybe not.
[04:43.46]Battle of the ha-ha's.
[04:45.78]The vast majority wants spore.
[04:47.28]I don't even have spore installed.
[04:48.60]I don't even have Origin on my computer.
[04:51.86]Do the movies?
[04:55.18]No, I need to go download fucking Origin and install spore.
[04:59.09]That's gonna take like two hours.
[05:02.51]This is close.
[05:08.21]This is close.
[05:10.39]So we'll just do both, apparently.
[05:13.15]We'll start with Family Feud and we'll go to Hitman or then we'll go to LEGO City Undercover.
[05:18.98]We'll just see where the night takes us.
[05:22.54]But as of this moment, thank you for voting.
[05:24.32]We're going to play Family Feud first.
[05:27.30]Spore is on Steam, is it really?
[05:33.41]Alright, polls closed, we're doing Feud first.
[05:35.19]Let me change my settings to say... Uh... Z-E-S.
[05:43.69]Fam Feud.
[05:44.38]Did I spell... Am I spelling Feud right?
[05:52.30]I don't think I'm spelling Feud right.
[05:53.48]I don't even care.
[05:59.02]No, not Family Dog.
[06:00.10]Family Feud.
[06:02.31]I'm not spelling feud right.
[06:03.73]Don't care.
[06:12.11]Family feud is a funny way to say spore.
[06:15.49]This is true.
[06:16.25]Alright, where is it?
[06:20.37]It's like over here somewhere.
[06:24.78]There it is.
[06:25.64]Alright, here it comes.
[06:26.40]Family Feud.
[06:28.10]SNES Family Feud.
[06:29.02]The tried and true SNES Family Feud.
[06:33.52]As we've all come to love it.
[06:34.55]Let me just do this.
[06:39.51]It might be loud, so I'm going to warn you.
[06:40.81]It's going to be very loud, probably.
[06:43.49]Turn your shit down.
[06:44.69]Alright, here it comes.
[06:52.39]Da-da-da.
[06:54.11]Da-da-da.
[06:56.30]Alright, move back here.
[07:00.28]Not game capture.
[07:01.18]We want this to be... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:09.28]Yeah.
[07:10.70]Yeah!

[08:31.13]Was not prepared.
[08:32.60]Never prepared.
[08:36.46]Sorry, I expected... Sorry!
[08:38.90]Sorry, I expected a fucking $40 game to have more than like 32 minutes of content.
[08:46.88]Does that make me a bad guy?
[08:47.98]Does that make me a stupid idiot to expect that a fucking $40 game would have more than like 12 minutes of things to do?
[08:58.19]I don't think that makes me a bad person.
[08:59.31]I think it makes me a realistic person.
[09:08.05]Okay, here we go.
[09:09.79]Hold on.
[09:12.93]We back.

[69:52.02]Yeah, let's do it again.
[69:57.61]Name the best Christmas gift you ever received as a young kid.
[70:00.89]That's so subjective, though.
[70:02.39]Think about sub- like what do you- That's the most subjective thing ever.
[70:05.61]Like a car?
[70:06.81]No.
[70:09.74]That could be anything.
[70:10.80]You could tie sentimental and emotional value to something.
[70:14.32]It could be like a dirty sock you got, but it was like your favorite dirty sock because like your like grandmother gave it to you or something.
[70:19.90]That's way too subjective.
[70:21.18]I don't like this one.

[70:35.38]No, apparently not.
[70:39.08]I don't want this.

[70:47.99]A train set!
[70:52.15]Yeah, that's okay.
[70:53.11]Cool.
[70:53.33]Great.
[70:53.79]If I got a train set when I was like fucking younger, I would have smashed it and screamed in my mom's face.

[71:25.51]I'm kidding.

[71:33.38]But no, it's not going to be video games.
[71:36.14]As much as it could be.
[71:36.92]It's going to be all these lame things like exercise and like learning about trains and like taking care of a doll.
[71:43.95]Where's the video games and potato chips?
[71:49.57]Where's the fucking console game and the fucking hot dogs and shit?

[72:13.00]Hey, Mr. Sneak Man.
[72:15.02]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[72:17.28]And they don't get two no guesses in a row, by the way.

[72:24.02]He's been right fucking here the whole time.
[72:26.60]Of course he can play.
[72:27.38]He sits here sometimes and he grabs a controller and he takes his guess.
[72:32.31]And when I was a kid, when I was fucking 16, I was blessed with getting a race car for Halloween.

[84:38.29]Okay, I was going to say, like, your conscience sometimes is like, give up.
[84:42.77]And you're like, I don't want to give up.

[87:55.74]Oh, God.
[87:56.70]Um... College?
[88:07.93]It's either car... We're gonna go with car.
[88:10.61]Car.
[88:14.45]Car.
[88:15.01]Okay, fuck.
[88:15.77]What is this last one?
[88:19.46]College?
[88:19.94]I'm gonna say, like, educate.
[88:21.40]College.
[88:22.86]Has to be college, right?
[88:23.62]Okay.
[88:27.92]Wait, not collage.
[88:29.54]You don't buy a collage.
[88:32.60]You go to college.
[88:34.86]We aren't making like a dream catcher to hang over our head.
[88:42.98]Jesus.
[88:47.24]College.
[88:47.62]Shit.
[88:51.56]Don't steal this, please.
[88:55.88]What could it be?
[88:56.74]No guess.
[89:02.24]Furniture.
[89:02.74]I swear to God, if this is furniture, I'm gonna be so angry.
[89:07.22]Don't be furniture.
[89:07.94]It's fucking furniture.
[89:11.50]That goes into house.
[89:12.74]Like, house and furniture is like the same fucking thing.
[89:16.25]When you buy a house, you're gonna buy furniture.
[89:21.49]Why would you just buy a couch?
[89:25.09]There's no reason for that.
[89:26.31]Like, you're just gonna buy a couch and just let it sit in your fucking garage?
[89:33.04]God damn it.
[89:39.06]I decided to invest in a couch.
[89:44.36]Really?
[89:44.62]Guys, I'm really thinking about the future here.
[89:46.92]I'm thinking about the future.
[89:48.04]I really want to invest in my future.
[89:50.60]I'm buying a couch this year.
[89:52.18]Go.
[89:55.38]I don't care.
[90:02.57]Damn it.
[90:05.83]That's how I feel internally right now.
[90:08.37]Skip, skip, skip.
[90:09.27]I don't care.
[90:10.49]Just get me the fucking actual game.
[90:11.85]I don't care if I make any money.
[90:14.38]Let's go.
[90:18.82]Name a food you buy more than one of at a time.
[90:22.30]Bananas.
[90:26.51]I'm going to add an S this time.
[90:27.69]Don't worry.
[90:30.25]Bananas.
[90:33.03]You buy more than one of at a time.
[90:39.80]Eggs?
[90:40.08]That's going to be number one.
[90:42.45]No, it's okay.
[90:46.19]Here's the thing, guys.
[90:46.95]So many things come in a package of more than one.
[90:50.15]We'll never get all these.
[90:51.13]Because you know some dickheads are going to write, like, hot dogs.
[90:56.20]Or, like, chicken patties or something.
[90:59.80]It's just so many things.
[91:03.19]I mean, grapes is obviously the easiest one.
[91:06.74]You don't just buy one grape.
[91:09.62]Somebody could write like olives.
[91:13.10]It's not even number one either.
[91:14.08]I would assume that would have been.
[91:19.41]Berries.
[91:25.29]Strawberries.
[91:25.99]That's very vague.
[91:28.66]Of course, it's probably blueberries or strawberries.
[91:30.58]Something stupid because it won't fucking fill it in for me.
[91:35.50]Rice?
[91:35.80]Yeah, you don't buy one grain of rice.
[91:37.30]Oh, please.
[91:44.23]Bread?
[91:44.67]But bread comes in, like, a loaf.
[91:47.23]You don't buy, like, more than one loaf of bread.
[91:49.09]I mean, I guess it could be sliced.
[91:57.81]I don't think it's bread.
[91:58.51]I mean, like, hot dogs, but, like, who the fuck knows?
[92:03.97]It could be anything.
[92:07.33]Potatoes, yeah, potatoes.
[92:15.41]Potatoes.
[92:15.95]That's number one.
[92:23.60]Chips?
[92:27.56]You buy a bag of chips.
[92:31.12]You can't, like, purchase a chip.
[92:32.56]You have to buy a bag of chips, which has chips in it.
[92:41.52]I don't know.
[92:42.02]Like, corn?
[92:43.38]You don't just buy one- You don't buy one ear of corn.
[92:47.48]You buy, like, a shitload of corn.
[92:49.06]Corn.
[92:53.58]So what is it, then?
[92:57.10]You don't buy, like, one chip.
[92:58.54]You buy a ba- You can't even buy one chip.
[93:03.45]Apples.
[93:04.05]Oh, fucking god.
[93:05.19]I knew it was just gonna be one of these random fucking fruits or vegetables.
[93:08.93]There it is.
[93:13.12]hot dogs and soda.
[93:23.99]Well, let's try it again.
[93:26.03]Try this shit again.

[93:36.55]I don't know.
[93:38.32]Helicopter?
[93:43.58]It's, like, the only thing back in, like, the 90s.
[93:45.48]It was a helicopter.
[93:51.60]Track criminal?
[93:52.44]Like, car?
[93:53.48]I don't even know.
[93:58.14]It could be dog.
[93:59.08]Yeah, dog?
[93:59.68]Well, they're having an issue, so I think I'll be okay.
[94:04.54]They're having an issue.
