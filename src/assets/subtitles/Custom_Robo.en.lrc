[00:01.21]Hello.
[00:01.45]I was where I get that.
[00:03.71]I don't think maybe I didn't open my mouth for a long time.
[00:06.74]But when I just opened my mouth, it was like.
[00:10.68]My mouth was glued together.
[00:16.77]What's going on?
[00:17.25]Yeah, sorry I'm late.
[00:18.45]This is on me.
[00:19.05]A couple things came up that I had to give a solid real look to.
[00:24.29]Auto had to be taken care of.
[00:27.29]I had to eat a 10 milligram CBD edible brownie.
[00:33.24]That part didn't happen because you don't always tell when I'm lying when I make that here comes a live voice.
[00:37.40]What's my tell?
[00:41.28]I'd be so bad at poker.
[00:49.67]I would lean in on poker.
[00:51.29]I'd have like pocket aces.
[00:54.87]And they'd go around the table.
[00:55.63]What do you want to do?
[00:57.21]Call.
[00:58.71]Call.
[01:00.61]Call.
[01:01.35]Mr. Elbertson, what would you like to do?
[01:04.16]I'd like to race.
[01:04.70]That's my tell.
[01:06.70]That's my live voice, apparently.
[01:14.62]He's late.
[01:15.28]I know I'm late.
[01:16.04]You don't think I know this?
[01:17.12]I'm looking at the clock.
[01:18.30]I gotta mute.
[01:23.23]I said they're staring at the clock going, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[01:26.42]I'm going to be in so much.
[01:27.32]I'm going to be in so much trouble.
[01:28.64]Everyone's going to be so mad.
[01:29.66]But I'm here.
[01:31.28]I'm going to play Custom Robo.
[01:36.60]The GameCube.
[01:40.38]Get him into detention.
[01:43.34]This game is one of the greats that I've never played.
[01:50.83]When I bought the Wii and I bought this, it's been sitting there for a while.
[01:54.14]It's been on that shelf for at least six months.
[02:01.86]Custom Robo.
[02:02.60]I thought you said sucks.
[02:08.31]But people, I'm going to tell you right now, this is the welcome to the stream today.
[02:12.87]20% of you are gonna be like, oh, fuck this game.
[02:14.97]20% of you are longtime fans of this whole series.
[02:18.73]You're gonna be fighting those people.
[02:21.16]And then 60% of you have me in a tab anyways, and you don't even care.
[02:35.92]Like 60% of you guys have me in a tab.
[02:37.86]And the second that you start hearing like the live voice, you're like, alright, let me tune in.
[02:41.82]What's he lying about today?
[02:44.38]I'm going to go this way.
[02:45.75]What the fuck is that thing?
[02:48.35]And let me tell you something, guys.
[02:49.33]Let me tell you.
[02:49.99]Oh, click over.
[02:50.55]Click, click, click, click, click, click.
[02:52.07]Okay, I'm ready.
[02:52.93]What's he doing?
[02:58.27]It's only like 5% of you.
[02:59.69]I hope.
[03:10.63]Alright, let's go.
[03:11.79]This is Custom Robo incoming.
[03:15.67]I don't know anything about this game.
[03:18.89]At all.
[03:19.13]I hope you can hear it.
[03:21.95]Because I can't.
[03:22.55]Can you hear it?
[03:26.66]Yeah!
[03:29.18]Alright, this is a game about customizing a robot.
[03:31.16]You put them and they fight.
[03:32.09]They battle.
[03:33.57]You battle other people's robots.
[03:35.25]It's like Pokémon, except you actually make shit.
[03:37.19]You don't just like steal animals and put them into a fucking ball.
[03:41.28]It's Pokémon, but the person has to actually work and actually do shit.
[03:55.09]No, that's not right.
[03:56.57]That's not real.
[03:57.34]Alright, this is a new journey.
[03:59.44]I'm ready.
[03:59.80]I'm excited for this.
[04:04.40]Hello?
[04:09.00]You hear a phone ringing, and it could be anyone.
[04:12.28]Nobody can do Kiefer Sutherland but him.
[04:13.68]That's another guy that you can't do.
[04:15.94]Hello?
[04:17.38]Oh, you're there.
[04:18.02]Good.
[04:20.53]Sans Sans when he's older and he's talking to his son Sons Dad?
[04:42.69]What's wrong, Dad?
[04:43.51]Why aren't you at work?
[04:46.63]It's your birthday, isn't it?
[04:48.39]I brought you a present.
[04:49.57]Here, hold out your hand.
[04:50.83]Is this where, like, Dad makes you pull his finger or something?
[04:55.85]Wow.
[04:57.15]It's the watch you promised me.
[04:59.86]Don't you need that for work?
[05:03.22]It's a very special watch, sons.
[05:06.54]There's nothing else like it in the world.
[05:09.12]And I want you to have it.
[05:12.93]they're serious you're really giving it to me thanks dad this is so cool cut to the watch is broken because the kid dropped it and stepped on it and smashed it and maybe dad you shouldn't give like an eight-year-old like a 14 million dollar rare artifact watch not a great idea like I said it's very special and I need you to take care of it
[05:39.67]No problem, Dad.
[05:40.37]I'll take good care of it.
[05:42.33]Good.
[05:42.59]I'll promise you one more thing.
[05:45.24]Keep it on you always.
[05:46.78]Don't ever take it off.
[05:48.46]Even in the shower.
[05:50.42]Even when taking a bath.
[05:52.74]Uh-huh.
[05:53.22]You got it, Dad.
[05:54.60]I'm never ever gonna take it off.
[05:58.18]Think of me when you wear this watch.
[06:00.44]Take good care of it.
[06:02.61]Even when you're all grown up, I want you to keep it safe.
[06:06.51]It's not gonna fit anymore.
[06:07.57]It's gonna be embedded in his arm.
[06:10.71]Don't ever take that off and don't ever adjust it either.
[06:13.25]Oh no.
[06:14.83]It's gonna be a big red embedded infected fucking thing on his wrist.
[06:21.10]Huh?
[06:23.88]The watch ringing?
[06:24.82]Look at the time.
[06:29.28]Dad's gotta go.
[06:30.20]You be a good boy now.
[06:31.40]He's gone.
[06:34.57]And he's never coming back.
[06:38.60]Huh, you're leaving?
[06:39.45]But you just got here!
[06:41.43]I'm sorry, son, but I have to.
[06:43.61]Uh, there's some work that only your old man can do.
[06:46.67]I have to go and get cigarettes.
[06:55.49]Goodbye, son.
[06:56.89]Why are we getting a I'm-gonna-get-cigarettes meme?
[06:58.98]Remember, think of me when you wear this watch.
[07:02.78]Take care of it.
[07:03.32]Don't forget, alright?
[07:04.24]Is this even my dad?
[07:09.54]I won't, but Dad, where are you going?
[07:12.38]Far away.
[07:13.04]I have to go to a place that's very far away.
[07:17.40]Prison.
[07:19.08]I'm going to prison, son, and I don't want you to know.
[07:22.00]Holy shit, he sped off!
[07:36.17]Dad?
[07:42.62]That was insane.
[07:43.74]Why would you do that in front teaching your kid all this fucked up shit?
[07:48.80]Wake up.
[07:50.55]You got wax in your ears?
[07:51.91]I said wake up and get out of bed.
[07:53.83]What the hell am I in a hospital?
[07:59.75]Honestly.
[08:02.08]Just because you don't work doesn't mean you can sleep your day away.
[08:05.00]Do you even know what time it is?
[08:08.26]It's past noon!
[08:10.00]You were supposed to start streaming 31 minutes ago!
[08:12.34]Don't you have a job interview?
[08:16.42]What was that place again?
[08:17.78]Stale Horse?
[08:20.76]You need that job if you're gonna pay your rent.
[08:23.00]Now get up and get that job.
[08:28.13]You heard me.
[08:28.61]Get out of bed and drag your lazy behind to that Steel Horse interview.
[08:35.33]Jeez.
[08:35.96]Good morning to you too.
[08:37.06]And it's not Steel Horse.
[08:38.58]It's Steel Hearts.
[08:41.48]Whatever.
[08:42.20]Just get up and get out of bed.
[08:44.26]You need that job.
[08:46.32]Oh, and good luck.
[08:52.56]What kind of room is this?
[08:53.88]This is a hospital.
[09:00.07]I still have the watch on?
[09:01.11]Wow, these are interesting clothes.
[09:04.33]Holy shit.
[09:05.21]This is awesome.
[09:06.89]I wasn't expecting it to be running.
[09:13.14]Half-Life TF2 open door sounds, right?
[09:15.58]Whatever.
[09:18.14]Wait, can I do anything in here?
[09:19.88]Can I touch anything?
[09:24.74]No new part data.
[09:25.81]Please come back.
[09:28.09]It's Kingdom Hearts.
[09:34.16]Yeah, this character exists in the Kingdom Hearts universe somewhere.
[09:38.16]Oh, hold on.
[09:39.80]Well, look at you, all gussied up and ready to go.
[09:42.48]Now, don't you come back here without a job.
[09:46.30]I've been worried about you, and not just because of the rent, you know.
[09:51.39]You worried about me?
[09:53.35]Well, we've all been worried.
[09:55.17]Not a single word from your father for years, and then that letter comes.
[10:00.48]It must have been a terrible shock to find out about his death like that.
[10:03.70]Just a letter and a will.
[10:04.94]Did he crash his car eight years ago?
[10:12.24]Just curious.
[10:16.88]Telling me to become a robo commander?
[10:18.75]I know it's weird, but I hadn't seen him for so long.
[10:23.29]In fact, the only thing I really remember about my dad is the watch he gave me.
[10:30.38]I don't remember anything else, but that's beside the point.
[10:33.68]I need to worry about the future now.
[10:38.44]That's certainly true.
[10:39.42]You've been living off your family savings for years.
[10:43.17]It's about time you got a job.
[10:46.35]I'll do my best.
[10:48.51]In fact, I'll do whatever it takes to become a commander.
[10:54.30]He's a neat.
[10:59.18]That's what your father wanted, isn't it?
[11:00.80]At least that's what it said in his will.
[11:04.10]You're a good boy.
[11:05.36]You could go for any job you wanted, but you don't want to let your father down.
[11:09.08]You could go for any... What do you mean?
[11:11.80]You're a good boy.
[11:12.96]You could go for any job you want.
[11:15.68]But since when does being a good boy represent skills in a field?
[11:20.01]You go to a job interview.
[11:25.07]Now what would you say your skills are?
[11:27.09]Well, I'm a good boy.
[11:28.13]Holy shit, that's the first one we've heard today.
[11:30.77]Come on in.
[11:32.17]We only have bad boys here.
[11:34.01]They all have tattoos all over the place.
[11:35.99]They have neck tattoos and they wear leather jackets to work.
[11:39.33]Oh, thank goodness we've got a good boy finally.
[11:48.00]I wonder why did my dad want me to become a commander?
[11:51.54]I don't know why it was so important to him, but I'll give it a try at least, huh?
[11:57.85]I'd like to see his last wish fulfilled.
[12:00.01]A commander, huh?
[12:01.31]Yeah, I can do it.
[12:04.85]What's a commander do?
[12:05.71]A commander's a person who controls a custom robo.
[12:11.14]Hmm.
[12:12.94]No, I'm afraid I just don't follow that.
[12:14.74]Could you say it a little less green?
[12:17.96]Anyway, don't think of me as a landlady.
[12:20.65]Think of me as a friend.
[12:22.89]If you need any advice, just ask.
[12:25.13]Thanks.
[12:28.15]Well then, you go get that job and become a commander at Stale Horse.
[12:33.06]I'll do my best.
[12:35.18]Bye.
[12:35.66]What the fuck just happened to the game?
[12:52.16]Hold on, nobody move!
[12:53.50]Nobody move.
[12:58.97]Nobody move!
[13:00.95]Okay, we're good.
[13:04.57]Alright, is this the steel horse?
[13:12.32]One day, I'm gonna join the police squad and use my robo to fight Prime.
[13:15.92]What are they doing?
[13:20.30]I'm going to keep practicing with my custom robot until I'm a big and strong bounty hunter.
[13:23.82]Are these kids in timeout?
[13:28.54]This looks like future timeout.
[13:30.60]I don't get it.
[13:32.34]What are they doing?
[13:38.12]My wife told me the kids would need a robot if they were going to get anywhere in this world, but those things are expensive.
[13:45.28]I have my needs too, you know.
[13:49.57]Hi there, neighbor.
[13:51.17]Job hunting again?
[13:52.33]It must be rough out there.
[13:53.97]Good luck.
[14:01.01]It's not Bernie.
[14:01.75]Alright, we have to go to the stale horse.
[14:05.50]Is this like Pokémon?
[14:09.14]Hey, just a second.
[14:10.52]I said you could treat me like a friend.
[14:11.96]That doesn't mean you can go poking around in my office.
[14:16.46]Right, left, right, left, right, left.
[14:20.92]Where is this place?
[14:26.16]Whoa.
[14:32.43]Oh, it's doing it automatically.
[14:35.09]Okay, that's good.
[14:36.43]Uh-oh, here comes the first tutorial battle.
[14:41.69]Who do I talk to first?
[14:45.60]Alright, let's talk to you.
[14:48.84]What do you want?
[14:49.70]Alright, you're here for the interview.
[14:52.36]You see that scary looking guy over there?
[14:55.53]He's the guy you want to talk to.
[14:56.41]He's the boss.
[15:08.49]Okay.
[15:09.13]What's this one?
[15:09.81]That's weird.
[15:11.31]It sounds like a trash compactor that's not a person talking.
[15:15.31]So, you're here for the interview.
[15:17.07]Alright, let's get this over with.
[15:20.29]Ever work a bounty hunter before?
[15:21.99]Of course.
[15:25.68]No, it's my first time.
[15:27.02]I think I have.
[15:30.24]No, it's my first time.
[15:31.58]Of course.
[15:32.42]No, it's my first time.
[15:34.32]I think I have.
[15:35.10]No, it's my first time.
[15:37.40]And don't be cocky.
[15:42.87]Look, forget it.
[15:44.93]Moving on.
[15:45.55]Next question.
[15:46.53]You got a robo?
[15:48.93]I lost it.
[15:49.73]I can't afford it.
[15:50.35]I lost it.
[15:50.95]I can't afford one.
[15:52.09]You got a spare?
[15:52.91]I lost it.
[15:54.75]I can't afford it.
[15:55.31]You got a spare?
[15:56.03]That was perfect.
[16:07.22]I don't have to do this one.
[16:09.82]That's just how the guy laughs.
[16:10.82]That's okay.
[16:13.75]You're funny.
[16:17.28]Anyway, I'm sorry, but I need an experienced guy with his own robo.
[16:21.87]I just can't afford to hire an amateur.
[16:24.05]My watch is going to turn out to be a robot, right?
[16:26.79]What are you talking about?
[16:29.45]We can't afford to hire anyone who's not an amateur.
[16:33.71]Besides, I'm being the new guy.
[16:35.68]I'm sick of being the new guy.
[16:36.58]We need someone I can push around.
[16:39.27]I'm sick of dealing with the chief on my own.
[16:42.77]What did I tell you about these bad boys?
[16:44.53]Hey, just a quick question.
[16:48.17]You wouldn't happen to be a good boy, would you?
[16:53.45]You got something to say?
[16:56.43]Listen, even if we did hire you, we don't have a robo or a spirit.
[17:00.32]You'll need to get one.
[17:04.88]Make a good impression.
[17:06.72]What should I say?
[17:13.07]I'm a good cook.
[17:16.75]Oh, great.
[17:17.55]I'll call you when we're going after the sinister spatula and his bake sale bandits.
[17:22.23]None of this really matters though.
[17:25.67]The simple fact is we don't have the money to buy you a robot.
[17:32.46]So that's why I can't hire you.
[17:34.08]Does he have a booger hanging out of his nose?
[17:38.85]Oh, but we really need some fresh blood around here, Chief.
[17:44.33]We've got too much work and not enough people.
[17:46.04]Can't we get an old junker robo for him to use?
[17:51.18]You don't pay the bills around here.
[17:53.42]Sorry, pal.
[17:55.86]You look nice enough, but you might as well forget it.
[17:59.45]Whoa, we've got a call.
[18:02.29]Maybe it's a job.
[18:04.83]Job, huh?
[18:05.41]Let's see.
[18:06.95]Steelheart, your one-stop bounty hunting shop.
[18:10.00]This is Ernest.
[18:13.34]How are you today?
[18:14.40]You're sounding lovely, as usual.
[18:18.07]Lovely?
[18:18.53]Is that a woman, chief?
[18:20.25]You got a girlfriend?
[18:22.65]Shut up, you!
[18:28.02]Oh, yes, yes, of course.
[18:29.94]No, we'll be, yeah, yeah, right, yeah, yeah.
[18:32.43]I got it, I got it, I got it, yes.
[18:34.31]Understood.
[18:34.81]I'll send someone right away.
[18:40.70]Got work to do.
[18:41.80]Harry, standard burglary and the police squad's fighting theme.
[18:50.17]Police squad's fighting them now.
[18:53.51]We need a bit of theme music.
[18:55.45]Hey, you said you're a cook.
[18:56.31]Are you also a musician?
[18:57.45]I don't want to go if the police squad's going to be there.
[19:01.51]By the way, who just called?
[19:04.05]Whatever.
[19:06.19]Shut your yap and get going.
[19:08.47]Head out to the research lab.
[19:10.93]Request comes from the lab director.
[19:16.33]Linda?
[19:18.21]I'll go.
[19:18.85]Leave it to me.
[19:20.79]Oh, and Harry, take the kid with you.
[19:23.70]Once he sees what a real fight looks like, he'll tuck his tail between his legs and run home.
[19:28.82]What?
[19:31.08]Oh, man.
[19:31.54]Alright, come on.
[19:32.14]I just don't get in the way.
[19:33.26]Did somebody just say Reddit walk?
[19:45.99]That was Linda on the phone.
[19:48.41]She's the director of the Robo Research Lab.
[19:52.26]Hmm something going down at the lab She's really gorgeous smart and compassionate really she's the perfect match for me Okay, I think of her like an older sister sorta I mean not really but oh now that that's weird now That got weird
[20:14.86]That got weird.
[20:15.76]Really weird.
[20:16.62]In fact, like weird where it just made me uncomfortable being in the same seat as you.
[20:23.76]We're not sitting together.
[20:26.16]Don't try anything funny with her.
[20:27.36]You got it?
[20:29.28]Yeah, I got it.
[20:31.06]I make no promises.
[20:33.22]What do you mean funny?
[20:39.30]You know, like hiding behind a wall and then jumping out and scaring her.
[20:41.87]Stuff like that.
[20:47.80]Oh, they're in, like, thought battle.
[20:54.38]This is a fucking banger.
[21:00.07]It's those bottom feeders.
[21:03.07]Don't be mean.
[21:03.69]We're bounty hunters.
[21:08.61]Whatever, you all pray off the lowest of the low.
[21:10.45]You bounty hunters are all bottom feeders.
[21:12.71]Don't give me any static.
[21:14.85]We're here on an assignment.
[21:17.27]Oh, yeah?
[21:17.53]Nobody here asked you for your help?
[21:19.79]I did.
[21:20.13]Why does she have grill marks on her legs?
[21:28.07]Well, we got this covered.
[21:31.88]Looking good as always, Linda.
[21:34.88]Thanks, Harry.
[21:36.78]I need you to take care of those crooks right away.
[21:41.94]They're after Ray-01, our newest robo.
[21:44.69]It's still in development, and it was top secret.
[21:48.78]Off-secret?
[21:49.44]Oh, that's so cool.
[21:52.60]Hmm, yes, but there's no telling what could happen if it were to fall into the wrong hands.
[21:57.14]We can't let them take it.
[21:58.14]With your skills, you should be able to take care of them easily.
[22:02.22]But that's what we're doing.
[22:03.70]They're stealing our newest robo.
[22:06.04]One can't be too careful.
[22:09.66]That's right, you heard her.
[22:10.50]You can't be too careful.
[22:11.66]And that's where we come in.
[22:12.86]I can't imagine if my window was open and my neighbor was listening to this.
[22:21.26]I'm realizing this now.
[22:27.16]Hearing this out of context, this person... You know what?
[22:31.03]I would be happy with it completely.
[22:32.23]You know why?
[22:33.27]I'm writing a screenplay.
[22:35.09]I'm like doing a screenplay thing.
[22:37.59]Holy shit, that guy's up there acting.
[22:39.41]Oh, he's writing a screenplay.
[22:40.75]That's definitely what that is.
[22:42.03]What else could the fuck that be?
[22:43.86]There's nothing else that makes sense of that situation at all.
[22:46.88]That's a pretty cool screenplay that guy's doing.
[22:51.24]So we gotta get involved.
[22:52.08]But you know, you can't always rely on the police squad.
[22:53.94]Some jobs are just too important.
[22:58.54]Okay, then.
[22:59.90]You wait here.
[23:00.44]Try not to get in the way.
[23:02.34]You just watch, Linda.
[23:04.03]You just watch, Linda.
[23:05.09]This one's for you.
[23:09.27]Good luck, Harry.
[23:14.25]Burglar.
[23:14.97]Why do the burglars wear those on their faces?
[23:19.69]What do you want?
[23:20.75]You don't look like one of those police squad goons.
[23:24.11]My name's Harry, and I'm a bounty hunter.
[23:27.81]Bounty hunter?
[23:29.09]You mean one of those mercenary scumbags?
[23:31.97]I'm just doing the other guy.
[23:32.97]So what do you want with me?
[23:35.39]You want me to fight or something?
[23:37.29]Bingo!
[23:40.79]Man, do I feel sorry for you?
[23:41.99]I feel like this is me.
[23:46.83]I feel like this is me talking.
[23:51.44]Man, I feel sorry for you.
[23:52.54]Your luck just ran out.
[23:54.92]For the love of Linda, I, Harry of the Steel Hearts, will be your undoing.
[24:02.16]Wait a minute, Steel Hearts?
[24:05.18]You mean those bottom feeders.
[24:08.20]We're not bottom feeders.
[24:09.84]We're bounty hunters.
[24:15.12]I'm counting on you, Harry.
[24:16.60]Please, hurry up with the tutorial and protect Ray 1 and teach him how to press A already, for God's sake.
[24:25.01]We're trying our hardest, you know.
[24:31.77]Excuse me.
[24:33.99]What is it?
[24:34.33]What are those people doing?
[24:36.63]What are they doing?
[24:39.59]They're fighting, of course.
[24:42.75]Fighting?
[24:43.35]You expect me to believe they're fighting?
[24:47.41]Uh, yes.
[24:49.65]But they're not doing anything.
[24:51.89]They're just staring at each other.
[24:53.42]No, no, no, no.
[24:56.72]They're using their custom robos to fight.
[24:58.66]Can't you tell?
[24:59.38]Huh?
[25:02.59]Where?
[25:02.87]I don't see any custom robo anywhere.
[25:06.68]That's because they're fighting inside the Holouzam.
[25:09.15]The Holouzam, of course.
[25:13.41]Holouzam.
[25:15.49]It is a thought battle.
[25:17.61]Yes, a Holouzam is a fighting arena created in a digital environment.
[25:21.90]The custom robots fight within that virtual battlefield.
[25:25.06]Hmm, I think I get it.
[25:28.46]Please stop spinning it though.
[25:31.90]Oh, but yes.
[25:33.46]Where is Rail 1?
[25:37.02]I haven't seen any Robos at all since we got here.
[25:40.98]Well, a custom Robo remains in cube form until it is released into the Holosam to... Wait, you're teasing me, aren't you?
[25:49.37]Surely you know all of this already.
[25:53.08]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:53.86]I've never really seen a bell.
[25:56.16]You do work with Harry, don't you?
[25:57.80]Aren't you one of the Steelheart's bounty hunters?
[26:02.49]Steam coming out of my... I mean, yeah, I'm with the Steelheart's thing.
[26:06.51]Out of my ears.
[26:09.57]Well then, get to work.
[26:10.33]Go fight some burglars.
[26:11.35]What are we paying you for?
[26:19.84]Take a look.
[26:20.24]Harry and the police are having a tough time.
[26:21.84]You should be helping them.
[26:23.80]Uh, why don't I just go punch one of these guys in the stomach?
[26:28.35]What are you talking about?
[26:29.09]I mean, aren't these burglars right now completely engrossed in their digital world?
[26:33.69]What if I just went and stabbed them all in the back one by one?
[26:38.19]No, no, no, no.
[26:38.73]That's... I mean, you could try.
[26:41.07]I don't think it'll work.
[26:43.79]Yeah, I guess I'll help.
[26:45.37]Dead.
[26:47.12]Dead.
[26:48.56]Dead.
[26:51.95]Alright, is there one that's not fighting?
[26:55.46]This guy here is pretty strong.
[27:01.12]Just pick one of these up and overhead hit him in the head with it.
[27:03.46]I don't understand the problem.
[27:07.22]Harry, I'm here to help you.
[27:10.00]What did you... Ah!
[27:17.51]Oh, wait.
[27:18.03]There's the cube.
[27:20.81]Oh, you idiot, don't talk to me when I'm fighting.
[27:23.33]I lost the fight because of you.
[27:26.93]Yeah, that's what you get for not paying attention.
[27:30.25]Ow, ow, I think I hurt myself.
[27:32.11]Oh, shoot, they're going to swipe that new robo.
[27:35.21]Harry, uh, why don't we just shoot him?
[27:39.82]Let me help.
[27:40.28]But you don't even have a robo.
[27:43.96]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[27:44.92]Should I punch him in the face?
[27:46.16]I could punch him right now in his face.
[27:49.31]Let me borrow your robo.
[27:50.85]I'll use it to fight.
[27:51.63]It won't work.
[27:54.37]I've already done my eye scan registration.
[27:56.85]I'm the only one who can use it.
[27:58.07]Eye scan registration?
[28:00.42]What the heck?
[28:01.42]I got no time to explain.
[28:04.74]Whoa, can I go now?
[28:06.76]I mean, if you two were just going to fight amongst yourselves, you really don't need me here, do you?
[28:11.52]Even the crooks are making fun of us.
[28:13.98]If only you had a robo and a scrumptious cake.
[28:17.99]Robo?
[28:20.09]Hmm, I guess I'll take this one.
[28:26.41]What's this box?
[28:28.67]Huh?
[28:29.85]There's a button on the back.
[28:31.03]I better press it.
[28:33.82]I better forget it.
[28:37.60]Hmm.
[28:38.44]Let me show you a cool trick.
[28:39.94]I'm going to smash this off my head and it's going to crumble up like a can.
[28:42.98]I'm going to do the bar thing.
[28:44.18]I'm trying to describe the thing I want to describe to you guys, but it's hard to do it right now.
[28:54.10]Huh?
[28:54.24]It's starting to buzz!
[28:56.36]Whoa there!
[28:56.96]Did you just do an eye scan registration?
[28:59.96]You still haven't told me what that even is.
[29:03.89]Eye scan registration is when you look directly into the robo's sensor while pressing that button.
[29:10.61]But there's no time to explain that.
[29:13.33]The point is, you're now the only one who can control that robo.
[29:17.66]Hurry and dive!
[29:20.74]Dive?
[29:21.10]This is a robo.
[29:24.36]Shut up and do as I say.
[29:26.50]Beat that burglar.
[29:36.45]Think about it, kid.
[29:37.11]You should think about this, kid.
[29:38.45]You sure you want to go up against me even though you never used a custom robot for your entire life?
[29:42.45]This wise guy thinks he's too tough just because he hasn't got lucky against me.
[29:46.45]But, Captain, he's definitely not going to be lucky against you.
[29:50.51]And make sure to be in the mess hall for dinner.
[29:56.68]Nobody knows what that is?
[30:07.95]I'm not even gonna say what it is.
[30:09.23]Oh yeah, there's a lot of new people here.
[30:10.47]Oh, whatever.
[30:12.43]You'll figure it out.
[30:15.79]Alright, your robo will shoot out from the robo cannon on the left side.
[30:22.42]Robo cannon.
[30:25.83]It's a machine that shoots out the RoboCube.
[30:29.57]The RoboCube transforms once it's been fired.
[30:31.74]Alright, so I shoot it out of a cannon and it turns into a robot?
[30:38.94]This is custom Robo 101.
[30:40.84]What is this link?
[30:43.40]Alright, this is like, this is, whatever, I'll show it.
[30:48.69]This is better, I gotta make sure this is not the Chuck E. Cheese kiss image.
[30:53.27]Okay, cause I've, alright, it's not.
[31:03.32]What the fuck?
[31:15.17]There.
[31:16.63]There you go, I got it for you.
[31:17.51]Alright, when the robo cube counts down to zero, it completes its transformation.
[31:24.96]Do I actually run around with the robo?
[31:26.12]Press the B button to fire your gun.
[31:29.58]Use your gun to blam, blam, blam your enemy's energy down to zero and you win.
[31:33.36]Use the control stick to zoom, zoom, zoom around and use the B button to fire?
[31:38.11]Alright, I'm just going to do it.
[31:41.79]Look, the fight's made him weak.
[31:44.13]You don't do just that.
[31:46.29]Boom, zoom, zoom, bang, bang.
[31:52.65]Buzzwords.
[31:56.33]Enemy.
[31:58.68]Oh, shit.
[32:00.56]Alright.
[32:01.70]That's... That's the enemy.
[32:08.31]Changed parts and model types.
[32:10.67]Alright, hold on.
[32:12.77]Customized Robo.
[32:13.80]What do I have?
[32:14.34]Oh, he's so cool looking.
[32:16.66]This is Ray-01.
[32:18.68]Fighter model.
[32:19.58]Basic gun.
[32:22.13]Okay.
[32:22.91]Gun with basic capabilities.
[32:23.91]Fires three rounds at a time.
[32:25.22]Aerial and ground shots are the same.
[32:26.72]Medium range.
[32:28.90]Standard.
[32:29.80]Standard bomb.
[32:30.40]Standard pod.
[32:31.06]Standard everything.
[32:31.60]I don't have any... I... I... Oh, shit.
[32:34.66]Okay.
[32:36.24]There's 13 pages of guns?
[32:40.31]I'm sorry.
[32:41.29]That was... That just came up.
[32:43.77]Alright, let's go!
[32:50.06]It's an American game?
[32:51.54]What do you mean American game?
[32:53.00]Alright, ready, three, wait, we can, what?
[32:58.85]You, you have to throw them out like dice?
[33:03.21]How do I get out of the cube?
[33:04.47]How do I get out of the cube?
[33:14.02]Holy shit, this is actually pretty cool.
[33:17.94]He's reborn-ing?
[33:23.44]Zoom, zoom, zoom around.
[33:25.65]I don't have a zoom, zoom, zoom.
[33:29.65]Uh-oh, he's going to beat me.
[33:32.55]Do I have any other buttons or weapons?
[33:34.39]Wait, he just... Oh, wait, there's a double jump.
[33:42.91]Wait a minute.
[33:44.25]Alright, I get it.
[33:46.66]That's a missile.
[33:48.84]He hit himself with his own missile.
[33:51.36]Use the terrain to my advantage.
[33:57.06]I'm not mashing buttons.
[33:58.42]Oh, that was a dash move.
[34:05.18]That was like Falco.
[34:06.04]Alright, that was cool.
[34:11.80]That was pretty fun.
[34:12.66]That was just the basic tutorial.
[34:15.12]He landed on his neck.
[34:25.75]Uh-oh, one of the police guys just blew it.
[34:27.23]Go over there and clean up his mess.
[34:35.36]I like the soundtrack.
[34:38.12]Oh, come on, I knocked that loser out.
[34:39.58]Don't I deserve a break?
[34:40.56]Alright, listen up, that guy ought to be worn out from his fight too.
[34:43.87]If you listen to my advice, you should be able to beat him.
[34:46.09]Use the R button to fire bombs and use the L button to launch an attack pod.
[34:52.13]Okay.
[34:53.80]Sticky bombs.
[34:54.24]Now this is the enemy.
[35:24.98]Let me just look at it.
[35:29.58]Pod.
[35:29.86]Bomb.
[35:36.10]Finish.
[35:36.36]It's just easy enough.
[35:37.02]Just drop bombs.
[35:39.16]I'm still confused about this part.
[35:40.88]I have to tap A?
[35:47.85]Why does he have an advantage?
[35:56.77]They're kind of like homing missiles in a way.
[36:19.77]Why would you come over here?
[36:20.47]It's my fucking specialty.
[36:21.42]It's mid-range, dude.
[36:22.14]I'll shoot him in the air too, right?
[36:39.55]I'll come down and then do it.
[36:41.74]Ow.
[36:48.44]This game's cooler than I thought it was going to be.
[36:49.67]Uh-huh.
[36:51.91]Okay, class.
[36:53.69]Can I get an apology now?
[36:57.95]No.
[36:58.09]Why?
[36:58.27]That's just kind of hard to hit.
[37:18.96]Okay, boom.
[37:20.40]What?
[37:25.64]This game's worse than Evolva.
[37:27.36]What are you talking about?
[37:28.92]No.
[37:29.54]No, it is not.
[37:30.68]It is not even close.
[37:31.92]By the way, that game wasn't even bad.
[37:33.44]That game was actually kind of fun.
[37:34.72]You guys just wouldn't give it a chance.
[37:39.72]Not bad for an amateur.
[37:46.79]This is way better.
[37:47.51]I mean, this game is like a classic video game.
[37:51.09]We lost another cop.
[37:51.92]Take the next guy.
[37:52.58]The police squad ain't nothing still.
[37:58.85]I break a sweat.
[38:00.93]looks pretty tired if you listen to my advice you should be able to win try using the a button go jump you can do I know I'm going to Neelix again I know but it's it's fits for me I don't know why it doesn't fit this character at all though I just it's what I'm doing you can do an air dash twice I learned that already you can charge with the x button yeah nice alright I get it
[38:25.62]Rebel can't move when it's down.
[38:27.78]Use the A button to jump and the X button to charge.
[38:30.30]Crash.
[38:32.00]Got it?
[38:32.50]Got it.
[38:35.92]You only do a charge when you're on the ground.
[38:37.44]It won't work if you're in the air.
[38:38.83]Jump and crash.
[38:42.09]Evolva 2 waiting room.
[38:44.13]That game doesn't exist.
[38:46.51]Happen.
[38:47.77]Man, these people...
[38:55.73]make it.
[38:56.09]I can't make a game.
[39:00.60]Alright, get out of here.
[39:06.84]Alright, I'm just going to overwhelm this guy.
[39:08.00]Alright, he has a much longer countdown than me, doesn't he?
[39:10.32]No, he doesn't.
[39:14.01]Yeah, yeah, yo, yo, yo!
[39:16.27]Yo!
[39:18.03]Why does that happen?
[39:29.42]Yep.
[39:29.62]Look at that juggle.
[39:30.76]Look at that, around the corner.
[39:33.42]That's some Mario 64 battle team shit.
[39:35.92]Fuck, that hurt.
[39:58.75]How'd you get that close?
[40:03.26]Hey, oh, this game's fun.
[40:05.40]I really like this.
[40:07.92]This is just this is the tutorial.
[40:10.02]Got a lot more to see.
[40:11.34]With 13 pages of guns.
[40:15.94]You now have access to the twin flank pod F. Go visit a parched generator.
[40:24.61]You want rail one and smash?
[40:28.56]Um.
[40:31.69]Not really.
[40:32.61]No.
[40:35.41]Well, I think you still need some work, but well done.
[40:37.33]He was an assist.
[40:42.68]Yeah, I mean, I don't know him enough.
[40:45.00]I have to get to know this character and see if I like it.
[40:49.50]Before you take them on, go over to the parts generator and get yourself some new parts.
[40:53.12]Parts generator?
[40:55.14]I'll explain that.
[40:56.10]Just stand in front of it and press A. You'll get a new part.
[40:58.84]One you can use right away.
[41:00.00]Okay, go in front of that machine and press A. Yes, go press A. Thanks.
[41:05.59]You could have said that in one panel.
[41:08.53]You've got a twin flank pod F. Nice.
[41:13.71]Okay.
[41:13.95]So what does that mean?
[41:17.26]What happened here?
[41:17.78]I turn my back for one second and all my men get wiped out.
[41:20.90]I'm worn out, but we need that robo.
[41:22.77]The last guy is exhausted.
[41:25.63]This should be as easy as a scrumptious cake.
[41:30.09]Still, you'd better listen to my advice.
[41:32.63]Use the control stick to change the direction of the robo cube when it launches.
[41:40.12]When the cube hits the ground, the number shows how long it needs to charge for the transformation.
[41:45.59]To speed up the charge, tap the controller buttons rapidly.
[41:48.82]Okay.
[41:51.52]If you transform before your opponent, you get to attack first.
[41:53.68]So, I didn't know that.
[41:54.50]Use the control stick to aim the Robo Cannon where you want to shoot and then tap the buttons.
[41:57.74]Got it?
[41:58.84]Got it.
[42:02.51]Mash, mash, mash, mash, mash.
[42:08.01]Why are you linking me to this?
[42:09.63]What is it?
[42:09.99]Why?
[42:11.71]I don't get this.
[42:20.12]That's a shitty picture of me too.
[42:21.90]Like right about to start laughing with like eyes.
[42:24.64]I hate that photo.
[42:30.19]Turn, tappity, zoom zoom, jumpity jump, bang bang, boom boom, clam, crash.
[42:40.02]The porn ads, love it.
[42:41.00]Can we talk about that for a second?
[42:43.76]I was in a second porn ad.
[42:45.82]Is that what you... Because I know there was one before.
[42:51.52]Is this number two?
[42:56.82]Yes.
[42:57.36]Okay.
[42:57.92]For those of you that have no idea, and I'm not going to link it.
[43:00.19]I don't want to give any attention to it.
[43:01.77]It's like, why would I do that?
[43:04.21]Somebody used, for some reason, people used this.
[43:08.97]Me laughing and talking like six years ago or five years ago, whatever this was.
[43:14.69]And they put it on top of like it's me interacting with a girl online.
[43:19.21]It's like an interact with a girl fake.
[43:21.42]I didn't do it.
[43:22.04]Like they just use it.
[43:24.82]I have no idea.
[43:28.64]Yes, it's real.
[43:29.52]And this has happened twice.
[43:40.16]This is not a one-time occurrence.
[43:49.73]Somebody, alright, somebody said, oh, you sue him.
[43:53.38]Uh, okay.
[43:55.18]Okay, let's go over the amount of effort that it would take for me to get into a legal battle with a porn ad.
[44:02.10]What, am I gonna, should I lawyer up?
[44:04.46]Alright, I'm gonna lawyer up.
[44:05.44]Let's do, I don't, what do you want me to do?
[44:08.21]I don't even know where this company is based.
[44:09.69]I don't know who this, I don't know anything about these people.
[44:17.99]It's not worth it for me to do that I'm just waiting for the day that I get hit up by somebody that I like Haven't talked to in probably five ten years or something like that Hey, dude.
[44:32.61]Are you like doing porn now?
[44:35.39]What's this?
[44:35.79]What's this ad are you what's going on here?
[44:37.87]Did you see this and I'm like I should say yeah
[44:42.13]Yeah!
[44:43.51]Is that alright with you?
[44:46.57]Uh... Um... Yeah, I just was curious.
[44:49.87]That's you.
[44:50.45]Yeah, it's me!
[44:51.92]Okay, man.
[44:52.40]I just... Yeah, how are we having a good... Do you have any kids or anything?
[44:55.46]No, no.
[44:55.76]Do you have any kids?
[44:57.22]Yeah, four.
[44:58.18]Cool.
[44:58.42]How are they?
[44:59.26]They're good.
[45:00.08]Alright, see you again in ten years when you ask me another question.
[45:05.18]Hi.
[45:06.54]Wait, I have to customize.
[45:13.51]Plus, if it's not based in the U.S.
[45:14.91]Yeah, it's just that... Look, I'll be honest with you.
[45:19.50]I don't care.
[45:20.76]I really just don't care.
[45:21.80]Alright, where's that new thing?
[45:28.00]Basic?
[45:29.12]Standard?
[45:31.75]Where is it?
[45:32.13]Is it already attached?
[45:34.29]What was it called?
[45:41.66]It's a pod.
[45:43.14]Oh, it's the pod.
[45:44.24]Fuck.
[45:50.06]One flank pod.
[45:51.04]Oh, wait, mash.
[45:54.28]I wasn't mashing.
[45:54.96]I wasn't mashing.
[45:55.72]It's okay.
[45:56.08]Yes, I was.
[46:04.09]But no, I don't care.
[46:05.27]Really, I don't.
[46:08.13]Look, okay, let's go over this.
[46:10.31]If it was, like, something egregiously awful that I was in.
[46:16.03]Like, you guys all know, I have the green screen shit.
[46:18.79]And the green screen shit is literally, I don't care what anyone does with it.
[46:23.42]Except, you know, there's some things that I would not be comfortable with my image being put up, right?
[46:33.02]It's very few things.
[46:35.85]But let's be honest, I think you all know what they could be.
[46:43.29]That's how you juggle.
[46:51.54]Turla is sexy.
[46:54.62]Wait, I can aim this!
[46:56.58]Holy shit, this changes everything.
[47:06.57]You got like little mice?
[47:18.18]What about a penis enlargement pill advertisement?
[47:20.27]No, I don't care.
[47:23.53]You have access to the three-way gun.
[47:33.69]OMEGALUL, that's actually funny.
[47:35.93]Okay, yeah, I don't... There's a line, right?
[47:42.20]And the line, when you, if you cross the line, you know you're crossing the line.
[47:48.64]It's not hard to determine that.
[47:50.94]I don't think so.
[47:51.84]There's a very clear line, I think, of what, like, alright, don't fucking do that.
[48:03.82]Wait, who's this?
[48:07.38]God, when did you get here?
[48:10.92]Why did you hit your head?
[48:12.68]Listen, the reason you got beaten is because you're not properly trained.
[48:15.40]I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[48:18.86]You need to get out of the mercenary business.
[48:22.20]Start studying.
[48:23.24]Get yourself a class A license and join the police squad.
[48:27.92]Oh, don't start on that again.
[48:29.56]I told you I wouldn't be caught dead in one of those tacky uniforms.
[48:33.69]look I'll pay all your exam fees it won't cost you a dime come on what do you say it's not about the money I just don't like studying captain mira we've sent the criminals over to hq we ought to head back to there ourselves I can't believe we needed help from those bounty hunters
[49:00.41]I'll make sure that all police squad members present at this travesty will hit the training room hard.
[49:08.13]Captain Mira, we should get back to HQ.
[49:11.67]I'll be waiting at the front gate.
[49:16.95]See you, Harry.
[49:18.35]I'll be working late, so don't wait up for me.
[49:21.48]Get some sleep.
[49:23.58]Keep yourself warm when you go to bed.
[49:26.88]You don't want to catch a cold.
[49:33.35]Stop.
[49:37.55]Stop, stop.
[49:38.21]No, stop.
[49:38.61]You're ruining her for me.
[49:40.27]Stop, please.
[49:42.33]That's not what it's in up here in my head.
[49:44.02]That's not what she sounds like.
[49:44.82]Stop doing that.
[49:50.84]You always treat me like I'm a kid.
[49:52.44]Is that your brother?
[49:56.33]Is that your older sister?
[49:57.53]Is that your girlfriend?
[50:02.18]Is that your older sister?
[50:04.52]Yeah, geez.
[50:05.48]She's always acting so macho.
[50:06.92]It really freaks me out.
[50:08.16]Not that it's any of your business.
[50:15.59]Harry, are you hurt?
[50:18.39]Linda.
[50:21.99]Yeah, I'm okay.
[50:22.83]I never felt better.
[50:24.97]By the way, Harry, this person's weird.
[50:26.47]I would not want to talk to this person.
[50:28.00]They'd be weird.
[50:30.23]Look, I don't do this in real conversations with people.
[50:35.69]When I'm like one-on-one, I'm not like, Hello!
[50:38.23]Yes, Kim!
[50:39.43]We're gonna go get a nice delicious steak!
[50:41.66]I don't do that.
[50:43.58]I do sometimes.
[50:45.36]I do sometimes.
[50:46.84]A few times, I've done that.
[50:49.80]I yell up the stairs and I'm like, Honey?
[50:52.77]Can you come down here for a few minutes?
[50:54.07]I do this all the time.
[50:55.13]Fuck.
[50:55.85]I do this all the time.
[50:58.68]But not that often.
[50:59.82]Not every sentence.
[51:00.84]Maybe like once every few days.
[51:07.96]Well, he's got what it takes to be a great commander someday.
[51:09.86]Still, he's got a long way to go.
[51:12.41]Oh, I totally agree, Linda.
[51:14.19]Oh, you were so observant like that.
[51:15.71]It's incredible.
[51:17.57]It's not like he got the best robot that exists, Ray01.
[51:20.63]It's like the most strong robot.
[51:22.90]You gave him like a, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:24.68]I have a regular default Hearthstone deck and he has every legendary in the game.
[51:28.42]That's not, no, that's fair.
[51:34.74]Great commander, sheesh.
[51:40.59]Harry, I've got an idea.
[51:41.43]How about letting him use our new robot, Rayo One?
[51:46.73]He adapted it pretty quickly.
[51:48.83]And I'd like to gather some data on his usage and control.
[51:51.34]Can we talk about Hearthstone for one second?
[51:52.98]I know everyone's going to be like, just hold on.
[51:56.62]I played it recently and holy shit how much that game has changed.
[52:02.99]I was doing like the solo adventure stuff and I was like, oh, this is kind of fun.
[52:05.61]I remember when they did this stuff.
[52:07.55]The amount of like
[52:09.55]Throw up eight minions on the board, wipe eight minions, throw up eight minions on the board, add plus four, plus four to all minions, wipe all minions, put eight minions on the board?
[52:19.94]When did that start happening?
[52:23.40]No one asked.
[52:24.88]Yeah, I decided I wanted to talk about it.
[52:30.46]It was three years ago when it happened.
[52:33.68]That's probably the last time I really tried.
[52:41.22]you have no free will oh yeah are you sure are you sure it's not you that doesn't have and there he goes purged who has the power here wait this guy he's not really he's not with us he came by today looking for work
[53:06.53]The chief doesn't want to hire him, though.
[53:08.75]Oh, really?
[53:09.21]I'll recommend that Ernest hire him myself, then.
[53:14.01]I can't wait to see his face.
[53:15.21]So we can go ahead and take this Ray 01?
[53:17.88]Sure, go ahead.
[53:18.76]Of course, he's already registered.
[53:20.80]So he can only use the one that he's the only one that can use?
[53:23.50]Time to read.
[53:24.14]Yeah, I know.
[53:26.50]Dang, if only I'd made eye contact with it first.
[53:29.24]Wait, what?
[53:35.95]That's weird.
[53:38.09]It's an eye scan.
[53:39.23]So what, it just attaches to anyone that looks at its eyes first?
[53:46.33]So what if a baby looks at it first?
[53:49.49]Like an infant just happens to match eyes.
[53:51.60]Is that, is that it?
[53:58.32]We have to wait till that kid gets old enough to like think?
[54:01.88]We just put it in a shelf?
[54:05.19]Good link, good link, OMEGALUL, good link.
[54:08.29]Of course, you always say that.
[54:09.81]It's always good link, OMEGALUL, and then I click it and my nose is stretched by 20%.
[54:13.75]What is it?
[54:20.66]Did you, is this, did you photo, who is this?
[54:24.44]What is this?
[54:24.78]Wrong.
[54:36.25]No, I'm okay.
[54:37.17]No, no, no.
[54:37.57]I'm done.
[54:38.23]I'm done playing the game.
[54:40.15]I'm not showing anymore like Chuck E. Cheese and I. I'm not doing that anymore.
[54:44.06]We're done with that.
[54:46.18]Oh, another great question I completely forgot to ask.
[54:48.92]Oh, nothing.
[54:49.54]Come on.
[54:49.95]Tell your name.
[54:51.53]What?
[54:53.49]Oh, what's my name?
[54:55.41]Well, what is it?
[55:07.38]Not Jax.
[55:11.56]Paul.
[55:15.13]Oh, my name's Paul in all capitals.
[55:19.39]It's important.
[55:19.95]Otherwise it's lowercase.
[55:20.93]It's not my name.
[55:27.18]Paul 01.
[55:27.90]It's weird that... Oh, I should make a... I should make a Cheeto.
[55:59.79]Dale, huh?
[56:01.47]I'm Linda.
[56:02.01]Nice to meet you.
[56:06.92]Don't worry, Dale.
[56:08.26]I'll talk to the chief.
[56:09.44]Oh, fuck.
[56:09.78]It's lowercase d. Whatever.
[56:11.00]Ain't that great, Dale?
[56:13.06]Isn't it Sums?
[56:16.02]Oh, right.
[56:20.41]By the way, Linda, do you want to grab some lunch?
[56:23.49]Oh, I'm sorry.
[56:24.81]I've just got too much work to do.
[56:26.27]The whole lab's a mess.
[56:27.77]Thanks to those burglars.
[56:29.71]Besides, your work here is done.
[56:31.30]Don't you have to get back to the Steelheart's office?
[56:35.80]I'll give Ernest a call and ask him about Dale later.
[56:38.68]You know what I mean?
[56:40.76]See you later, Harry.
[56:44.00]No, I can't load a save state.
[56:45.50]I don't have a save state.
[56:51.57]Don't tell me that exists, by the way.
[56:57.83]She knows I'm a busy guy.
[56:58.93]She's got a lot of class.
[57:00.41]That Linda is awesome.
[57:04.41]Poor women or something.
[57:06.75]I almost forgot, Dale.
[57:09.85]I was going to tell you about the parts generator.
[57:12.98]You mean that machine?
[57:13.96]I've got one in my apartment.
[57:17.98]What?
[57:19.78]What's a parts generator doing in your apartment?
[57:22.32]You don't have a custom Robo, and you don't even know what they are.
[57:26.23]It belonged to my dad.
[57:28.83]I never knew what it was supposed to do.
[57:30.41]It just kind of sits there.
[57:32.77]Yeah?
[57:33.41]Well, I guess I'll just have to skip that accidentally.
[57:36.27]Anyways, I was about to explain about the parts generator registers new part data into your RoboCube.
[57:41.97]When you buy a Robo, it only comes with the standard parts.
[57:46.56]You won't have access to a lot of parts if you don't collect enough battle experience.
[57:51.92]When a Robo gathers battle experience, the internal computer records the battle information.
[57:56.93]And the parts generator automatically reads the record and gives you the new part.
[58:02.21]Any new parts you get, you can use them in the next battle.
[58:06.60]Whatever parts you want to use is up to you.
[58:10.44]You can customize as much as you'd like.
[58:15.24]That's it for the hard stuff.
[58:17.26]It's best to check the parts generator after every battle.
[58:20.47]Your opponent... Sorry, your opponent's not going to wait for you while you make a quick run to the parts generator.
[58:27.17]Obviously, you can't slip out during a battle.
[58:31.12]That's why it's best to check with the parts generator after every battle.
[58:34.84]Even if you forget to check after a battle, you can still get the part afterwards.
[58:38.56]However, if it's just waiting for you to pick it up, why not go get it as soon as possible?
[58:43.78]The more parts, the more you can customize your Robo.
[58:45.95]It gives you... I... Look, I know how to... I get it.
[58:47.85]Fuck.
[58:49.77]That last thing was important.
[58:51.29]It was just a hundred words of nonsense and then one important line.
[58:55.77]Also, open the customize screen before a battle.
[58:59.34]If you press the R button in that menu, you can practice with your new part.
[59:02.83]Cool.
[59:03.07]If you want to get out of practice mode, press start and then retire.
[59:08.85]Oh, like that guy, Jerma985, in about four years?
[59:10.71]Got it.
[59:11.23]Four years.
[59:26.30]Well, if you don't understand, press start while you're walking around.
[59:29.64]Let's get back to the office.
[59:30.57]Alright, let's go.
[59:36.29]Hey Dale, before we go, why don't you ask these lab guys for some info?
[59:39.33]They're robo researchers.
[59:40.75]They'll probably have plenty of stuff they can teach you.
[59:43.65]Give me a holler when you want to leave.
[59:51.23]You're done already?
[59:53.56]I don't want to hurry back.
[59:54.42]We get back too quickly and Ernest will just give us more work to do.
[59:57.26]Chill out.
[59:57.94]What?
[59:59.00]I told you I was ready to leave.
[60:00.24]Okay, here we go.
[60:04.09]I need to clean this place.
[60:05.01]There are parts all over.
[60:06.99]I've got no clue where to start.
[60:08.95]Custom robots are composed of five parts.
[60:11.13]A body, a gun, a bomb, a pod, and a leg unit.
[60:13.61]The commanders have the freedom to customize any of these five parts in any way they want.
[60:17.51]The custom part comes from planning your robot design based on battle situation.
[60:21.90]Thanks.
[60:25.57]Those criminals nearly got away with Ray-O-1.
[60:33.93]Robo's... They're in the holo museum.
[60:37.21]Wow.
[60:37.81]Go look in the museum one day.
[60:39.57]Go look in the museum.
[60:40.27]Isn't that cool?
[60:46.48]I talked to all the people.
[60:51.72]Wait, so you're the one who's taking Ray-01 from us, and you already did an eye scan?
[60:55.42]Whoever makes eye contact with a robo first is its registered commander, the only one it obeys!
[61:00.69]That's what eye scan registration is all about!
[61:07.25]Thanks for helping us.
[61:07.95]We're good at science, but not at fighting.
[61:09.59]By the way, did you know that people who are trained to pilot robos are called commanders?
[61:18.18]You're not even doing any work.
[61:19.22]What's your problem?
[61:20.56]Tell me.
[61:22.20]Most commanders become better at fighting by mastering each of the Robo's abilities.
[61:25.99]By fighting, Robos customize their programming and develop ability to operate on new parts.
[61:30.47]That's why Robos don't come pre-installed with all the parts.
[61:33.69]The custom Robo needs battle experience in order to alter its code and learn new parts.
[61:39.49]Parts generators, read your Robo's battle log and install any new parts in your Robo.
[61:42.75]Excuse me for a minute.
[61:47.07]Install any parts your robo is able to use.
[61:49.75]That's why you should check the nearest parts generator.
[61:51.97]Yes, check it all the time.
[61:56.92]Yeah, you want to know about the lab?
[61:58.26]There's a government-funded robo research and development lab.
[62:00.94]You've already met Linda, right?
[62:02.18]She's director of our lab.
[62:03.26]She's director.
[62:03.96]Cool.
[62:06.08]I feel like if all these guys just ran as fast as they could into each other and fucking full sprint smushed and smashed into each other, they could just be one guy and he could read me all that.
[62:17.09]I mean, you could have two, maybe.
[62:18.21]Oh, you're done already?
[62:22.95]I am done!
[62:23.61]Oh, you got a three-way gun!
[62:27.55]Did I miss somebody?
[62:32.12]This is a secret.
[62:47.27]Go on without me.
[62:49.23]Let's head back.
[63:00.31]No, don't take us off course.
[63:01.55]Don't take us off course, man.
[63:07.57]I'm going to abbreviate everything that's said for the next few minutes.
[63:14.34]Guys, talented chief.
[63:16.92]I don't know what happened out there, but Linda called.
[63:19.71]I'm supposed to hire him?
[63:21.49]Hey, you got a cool robo.
[63:25.43]Alright, you're hired.
[63:28.71]We don't pay very well.
[63:30.12]Aw, man.
[63:30.60]You got the job.
[63:33.58]Go home.
[63:34.70]I'm going home.
[63:36.66]Thanks.
[63:37.28]Tired.
[63:37.88]Yeah.
[63:38.66]See you later.
[63:39.86]Good.
[63:48.08]The Netflix dub.
[63:49.26]Oh, wake up, sweetie.
[63:55.00]You don't want this to be a complete and total voice acting stream where you just read dialog and everyone just goes, oh, wake up, you're going to work already.
[64:18.34]What the fuck are his pajamas?
[64:22.00]What was wrong with them?
[64:22.84]It's time for you to wake up.
[64:25.30]Don't you start work today?
[64:26.88]Good luck with that.
[64:27.48]I'll do my best.
[64:30.53]Now, I'm a little confused about all of this.
[64:33.25]What does a bounty hunter do?
[64:34.73]Is that like a mercenary?
[64:35.81]It's hard to explain, but basically we hunt down criminals with their crimes and robos.
[64:41.23]But isn't that what the police squad does?
[64:44.01]We take requests that the police squad considers too small to bother with.
[64:48.19]Sounds almost like those private eyes from the stories.
[64:51.15]Are you like a detective or something?
[64:54.66]Well, I guess all that really matters is you're a commander just like your father.
[64:59.64]So hard work.
[65:00.70]Uh huh.
[65:01.74]Bye.
[65:02.04]Oh, look at me.
[65:17.18]It's all the same voice.
[65:19.18]Yeah.
[65:20.20]Catching on.
[65:20.82]They're catching on.
[65:21.42]What do I do?
[65:21.86]Go check in with Ernest.
[65:24.16]He doesn't act like it, but he is the boss around here.
[65:31.96]Oh, you're here.
[65:32.54]We don't have the manpower to spend long training you.
[65:35.32]We need to get you up to speed quickly.
[65:38.52]Say, Ernest, where's Marcia?
[65:40.94]I mean, the new guy gets here right on time and she's nowhere to be seen.
[65:44.08]What's up with that?
[65:46.85]Marcia's on duty right now.
[65:48.24]She's not a slacker like you, Harry.
[65:49.84]Huh?
[65:51.30]On duty this early?
[65:52.36]I called you this morning, but you didn't answer.
[65:55.32]Really?
[65:56.82]That's odd.
[65:57.90]He ought to know I never answer my cell phone before noon.
[66:01.74]Well, that's why I sent Marcia.
[66:05.23]Let me go help her.
[66:06.35]I'll go.
[66:06.71]Thanks for the offer, but there's no need.
[66:09.97]Marcia will be fine on her own.
[66:12.91]Marcia's a skilled commander.
[66:14.51]Not quite as skilled as me, of course.
[66:17.34]I heard you blew it pretty bad yesterday.
[66:19.64]Got yourself hurt in the process.
[66:23.07]That was Dale's fault.
[66:24.15]He snuck up behind me and... Anyway, like I was saying before, you have to be ready for action.
[66:30.45]At a moment's notice.
[66:32.57]Harry, I want you to take Dale to the gym.
[66:35.59]Have him do some warm-ups.
[66:39.13]A little training, huh?
[66:40.13]Gotcha.
[66:40.49]Let's go, Dale.
[66:42.41]And keep your cell phone on.
[66:47.20]Yeah, yeah, I hear you.
[66:52.17]We get to go to the gym together?
[66:53.33]That wasn't Mr. Satan.
[66:58.77]This is Mr. Satan.
[66:59.87]And that's how you do, Mr. Satan.
[67:01.07]That was not even close.
[67:02.79]I got more than four voices.
[67:03.81]Come on, I got at least eight.
[67:09.16]This is the training gym.
[67:10.72]Ernest got us a group membership here so we can train whenever we want.
[67:13.76]Okay, let's do a round.
[67:15.68]You versus me.
[67:20.16]Two Macs.
[67:25.59]This table here is called a Holosam deck.
[67:27.69]It's a machine that projects a Holosam.
[67:29.49]Some commanders like me can create their own Holosam.
[67:31.81]Some can't just the way it is.
[67:34.75]Commanders who can't just use a Holosam.
[67:36.61]That's built.
[67:37.45]I thought I said that's bullshit.
[67:39.37]Commanders who can't just use a Holosam.
[67:40.87]Oh, that's bullshit.
[67:42.90]But they use Holosam decks like these to make one for them.
[67:47.25]Okay, before we start, I've got some pointers for you.
[67:49.77]You've probably noticed this, but you can change the direction the pod fires in.
[67:52.94]Mm-hmm, yes.
[67:54.90]If you don't tilt the control stick, it'll automatically fire in the direction of your opponent.
[67:58.74]Yes.
[67:59.48]Got it?
[67:59.92]Yes.
[68:20.93]Okay, I know you messed with the mouth But the eyes those are like my real eyes and it really does look like my eyes are made out of clay Like that's somebody's art project Jeff the killer
[68:48.82]This is his robo?
[68:49.90]Alright, let's put on my new parts.
[68:54.69]Ray 1.
[68:56.15]That's all we got right now.
[68:56.99]Basic.
[68:57.91]Three-way.
[68:59.29]There's three rounds and three rows.
[69:02.09]Aerial and ground shots are the same.
[69:04.67]It's easier to hit your target when shooting from afar, so try to stay away.
[69:08.02]Yeah, let's try it.
[69:10.50]For this guy.
[69:11.84]Standed.
[69:13.02]For this guy.
[69:14.44]Standed.
[69:16.62]Twin flank.
[69:18.31]Deploys one pod left and one pod right.
[69:20.13]Deploys two pods at one time.
[69:21.67]Alright.
[69:27.83]Standard is all we got.
[69:28.67]Alright, anything else?
[69:29.37]Oh, let's just check this out.
[69:34.30]You can change the color, too.
[69:36.36]We'll get into that.
[69:44.82]Mash buttons, right?
[69:52.16]Okay, good.
[69:54.28]They jump on you.
[69:55.00]Ooh, this one's nice.
[70:03.16]Odd, right?
[70:05.69]Ooh.
[70:06.05]This is the mouse thing the guy had.
[70:23.09]Ow.
[70:23.83]Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.
[70:33.01]Doing missile spam.
[70:34.59]I'm not doing missile spam.
[70:36.37]Remember, this is a fan art stream.
[70:50.67]This is not a fan art stream.
[71:01.99]Shoots more missiles, but I'm not sure I like it more.
[71:09.82]Alright, no.
[71:10.90]No more links.
[71:15.07]You now have access to the standard bomb S. Ooh, okay, cool.
[71:18.13]Alright, open the game up for me.
[71:20.31]I want to start customizing, fighting, and leveling up.
[71:23.59]I'm gonna rest for a bit.
[71:26.50]Why don't you just go up against the computer?
[71:27.88]No, I don't want to go up against the computer!
[71:33.52]Is he putting me into the room with the bots?
[71:43.74]Wait, I wanna go to a parts generator.
[71:45.00]Is this the only entire house that doesn't have a parts generator in it?
[71:49.46]It's saying... Where do you think you're going?
[71:58.50]I wanna... There we go!
[71:59.10]Right here.
[72:01.22]Standard Bomb S. Ooh, cool.
[72:06.00]Somebody said you're on an emulator.
[72:08.41]Shut... Stop it.
[72:10.21]Once a robot stops moving, it takes time for it to reach full movement speed again.
[72:13.67]Okay, cool.
[72:17.63]No, I own the game.
[72:18.63]I own the disk.
[72:19.47]I own everything.
[72:20.35]I own the Wii modes.
[72:21.17]I own the GameCube controller.
[72:23.16]It's right there.
[72:23.82]I own it.
[72:26.38]I own this game.
[72:27.64]I own it.
[72:28.00]I own it.
[72:29.26]I own the whole thing.
[72:32.88]Don't stop moving.
[72:33.70]Do you understand?
[72:35.66]Yeah.
[72:39.87]I am playing Custom Robo right now.
[72:42.27]I own the GameCube.
[72:43.63]I own the disk.
[72:44.63]I own the GameCube controller.
[72:46.19]I own it.
[72:46.83]That's all I'm telling you.
[72:47.53]I own this.
[72:49.62]Whatever.
[72:50.04]I'm fine.
[72:51.92]Stop it.
[72:58.16]Others.
[73:00.00]Okay, what was it called?
[73:03.01]It was a bomb, right?
[73:04.59]Standard S.
[73:07.18]Basic functions.
[73:08.38]Fly straight forward.
[73:09.62]Launches one bomb at a time.
[73:12.32]Immobilizes target.
[73:13.28]Launch as often as possible so your opponent cannot hide behind walls.
[73:15.80]Cool, let's try it.
[73:16.28]Why don't you prove it?
[73:21.00]Show your ankles.
[73:21.66]Ban that guy for at least three days.
[73:32.75]Alright, here we go.
[73:33.37]Alright, should I spam now?
[73:51.50]Oh, what?
[73:52.46]The spawn protection?
[74:00.14]Shit.
[74:00.36]Fuck, I'm gonna lose to the bot.
[74:33.58]I don't like this standard B. I'm not a big fan of standard B. It's too spread out.
[74:48.12]Destroy him.
[74:48.66]I'm trying!
[75:02.86]The normal one would have been better.
[75:03.86]I don't like it.
[75:05.31]I don't like it.
[75:05.75]Oh, please.
[75:29.75]Go ahead.
[75:38.85]No, fuck that rebirth shit.
[75:40.48]No!
[75:43.94]No!
[75:59.72]Game's good.
[76:01.48]Speed pod.
[76:03.56]Wait, so can I just farm pods?
[76:06.84]That was the wall.
[76:07.40]That was the tutorial wall.
[76:15.78]Speed pug.
[76:16.72]Let's see what it is.
[76:18.16]You got a speed pug.
[76:19.10]Okay.
[76:22.77]What does it do, though?
[76:24.99]Hey, where do you think you're going?
[76:28.29]I told you to practice.
[76:29.01]I just did.
[76:29.45]I just kicked his ass.
[76:34.62]I'm done training you.
[76:37.94]Oh.
[76:39.14]You become vulnerable after you fire a gun.
[76:40.94]Use a slide shot to cover this.
[76:44.55]If you press the B button while moving, you can fire your gun while sliding in that direction.
[76:47.91]If you use this skill properly, you can shoot while moving behind a wall.
[76:51.23]Ooh.
[76:53.25]A slide shot.
[76:54.23]Kinda cool looking.
[77:03.18]Alright, I wanna change some things here.
[77:06.00]Let's take the, uh... Speed pod, right?
[77:18.21]speed d quickly fly straight ahead can deploy two pods at one time tons of speed no homing right standard s yeah we'll keep standard s that's right what's with GameCube games and revoice tutorials you know you know
[77:52.92]I got three seconds on him already.
[77:54.04]Alright, let's make this happen.
[78:01.43]Play it right.
[78:03.71]Speed pod.
[78:21.51]The fast CPU.
[78:22.55]Ow.
[78:26.90]Wow.
[78:36.90]Fast VTuber versus what?
[78:54.72]This game's kind of challenging, like in a fun way.
[79:10.71]Get him down, get him down, get him down, get him down.
[79:22.44]Hey Nintendo, what the fuck are you gonna remember the series?
[79:24.94]You're gonna ask kids what are you saying?
[79:37.01]Somebody just did a spam and I couldn't read it.
[79:46.42]Fuck!
[79:51.22]I'm doing the slide shot, but I'm not doing it well.
[79:53.06]Alright, right here.
[79:58.41]Hey Nintendo, I can't read it.
[80:07.84]Hey Nintendo, when the fuck are you going to remember the series or remember F-Zero for more than aesthetic callbacks?
[80:15.18]When are you going to remember Kid Icarus and Nintendo stop fucking around and bring back the underdog games?
[80:21.16]You now have access to the criminal.
[80:23.26]Okay, cool.
[80:29.28]What's the criminal?
[80:33.56]You got a criminal!
[80:34.56]Wait, what?
[80:36.03]Is that a new robot?
[80:41.63]Allow me to explain the Trick Flyer model.
[80:44.35]My robo utilizes this body type.
[80:45.95]The Trick Flyer has excellent aerial abilities, however it moves slowly on the ground.
[80:51.12]Doesn't jump far, but it can do a quick air dash up to three times.
[80:55.51]When using a trick flyer, you should approach your opponent with an air dash and then attack.
[81:00.33]Get it?
[81:00.57]Oh, this looks cool.
[81:09.80]Alright, customize.
[81:13.28]Ray 1, I got criminal.
[81:21.21]Agile while airborne.
[81:23.03]Extremely slow on the ground.
[81:26.07]Red?
[81:26.35]Ooh.
[81:28.22]Red, blue.
[81:29.68]That's not blue.
[81:30.30]That's green, yellow.
[81:34.96]Hmm.
[81:36.54]Green.
[81:45.97]I like this one better.
[81:47.75]And it has speed D. Speed D is fine.
[81:51.51]Standard legs.
[81:54.25]Yeah, I'm fine with this.
[81:57.25]Alright, so this guy, I can move very fast.
[82:02.00]Basic is just worse, though.
[82:03.20]I know, it is worse.
[82:05.14]CBD?
[82:05.68]What, you want me to do CBD?
[82:25.64]Holy shit, this thing's awesome.
[82:26.80]You can go so fast in the air.
[82:28.16]Alright, don't waste it.
[82:38.35]Actually, kind of hard to do.
[82:47.21]He's horrible on the ground.
[82:48.17]It takes a... Okay, after you fire, it takes a full, like, two seconds before you can do anything.
[83:01.05]Ah, I don't know.
[83:06.01]This guy sucks.
[83:06.35]I don't like him.
[83:22.39]This character's terrible.
[83:29.89]Throw it in the trash.
[83:32.18]Just snap it in half at the torso and just put it in the recycling bin.
[83:40.46]I don't care about the trick flyer.
[83:42.20]I'm gonna kill you with Ray-01.
[83:52.92]No, not criminal.
[83:53.72]I want Ray 01.
[83:58.02]Yeah, he's better.
[83:59.04]And he's green.
[84:00.82]I want blue Ray 1.
[84:01.56]By the way, the speed thing, no.
[84:07.47]Not a big fan.
[84:18.27]I like the actual bullet bill travel ones.
[84:40.59]Ow!
[84:41.25]No, no!
[84:44.55]I'm using cover.
[84:45.23]I'm gonna use cover to my advantage now.
[84:55.22]Shit!
[84:55.42]I'm not losing already.
[85:03.55]I'm fine.
[85:18.86]I'm definitely a standard B guy, I'll tell you that.
[85:33.62]Found him, found him!
[85:36.50]I hate that rebirth stuff.
[85:41.85]There's no standard V. Yeah, it's standard V. Alright.
[85:44.67]What do I want right now?
[85:46.92]I want something.
[85:47.58]What do I want?
[85:49.78]Had some food earlier.
[85:50.86]Gemini Bomb P. No, not food.
[85:57.14]I want... Okay.
[85:58.40]Like another coffee or... What do I want?
[86:01.34]Water.
[86:03.89]Water.
[86:13.21]This is the last one here.
[86:15.18]You should take caution to prevent your robo from being knocked down.
[86:17.46]If you receive a powerful attack or repeated attacks in a short period, your robo will overload.
[86:23.32]It's knocked down and vulnerable to attacks for a short time.
[86:25.34]However, you'll be invincible for a short time if you get up while your robo's systems reboot.
[86:29.58]If you tap the buttons quickly, your robo will rise more rapidly.
[86:33.45]Fuck your stomach, get a milkshake.
[86:34.79]When am I going to get a milkshake right now?
[86:40.29]You wanna go make a milkshake?
[86:42.94]Go open, get a blender, put ice cream in it, put some milk in it, put chocolate syrup in it.
[86:47.24]It's gonna take like 12, it's gonna take like 15 minutes.
[86:49.34]I don't want a milkshake.
[86:56.65]What's that new item?
[87:01.73]MNIP.
[87:04.55]Launches a split bomb towards either side of your foe.
[87:08.78]I'll try it.
[87:09.20]I just punched you.
[87:10.16]I'm sorry.
[87:10.50]He's lactose intolerant.
[87:11.76]No, not really.
[87:12.46]I just have issues.
[87:13.41]How can he already have been able to go?
[87:38.85]Alright, what's it look like?
[87:43.13]Gemini P. Hard to tell.
[87:49.29]I'm gonna wrap around this side and then dash him.
[87:50.75]Aim sucks.
[87:58.56]Oh, it just spreads it out.
[87:59.90]I get it.
[88:00.34]Eh.
[88:05.04]I'm not a big fan of it.
[88:15.85]What's that?
[88:23.07]Oh, come on!
[88:37.01]Is this homing?
[88:45.41]There it is.
[88:46.87]He's dead.
[88:50.78]Whoa, late again, huh?
[88:52.50]I don't even know what it said.
[88:58.22]Use the grenade launcher when he's on the ground.
[88:59.28]It'll linger.
[89:00.70]And you can hit multiple times.
[89:02.14]You get the cockroach pod.
[89:06.82]Expertly done.
[89:07.44]Alright.
[89:08.37]I did it.
[89:08.71]The tutorial is over.
[89:13.45]Oh, the phone.
[89:13.95]Who could it be?
[89:14.43]Hey, hello.
[89:16.05]Where's Harry?
[89:16.59]That idiot turned his cell phone off again.
[89:18.69]Tell Harry to call me back right now.
[89:21.18]Got it?
[89:21.40]Cockroach pod.
[89:33.75]Come on.
[89:34.01]What's your phone number?
[89:36.19]You want my phone number?
[89:38.97]I could fool around.
[89:39.79]How about a date?
[89:42.55]Hey, what is it, Deal?
[89:43.53]Ernest wants me to call him back?
[89:46.13]Oh, man, I was totally going to get her number.
[89:51.38]Yeah, Harry here.
[89:53.28]What's up?
[89:53.70]I'm kind of busy right now.
[89:56.82]Why isn't Gina with Smash?
[89:58.42]I don't know.
[89:58.74]I wish I knew.
[89:59.16]Do you have to use language like that, Chief?
[90:03.49]Yeah, I got you.
[90:07.57]Hey, Deal, we got to work.
[90:10.24]See you, Sophie.
[90:10.88]Let's go on a date next time.
[90:12.30]Oh, you gotta go?
[90:13.61]What a shame.
[90:14.13]Good luck with work, Harry.
[90:18.07]Woo.
[90:19.87]This is when the number comes back.
[90:23.97]Woo-hoo!
[90:26.34]It's like, Harry, I think I'm gonna be busy forever.
[90:29.38]Yeah, just don't call.
[90:31.50]This is a don't call me, please.
[90:33.98]You're a weirdo.
[90:35.82]You better believe I'll be back.
[90:37.93]Okay, Dale, let's go.
[90:38.87]I'm all pumped up.
[90:41.07]It's just you button this person every time they call.
[90:45.27]On the first ring, because you don't care.
[90:46.94]Alright, we're going for Hub Park.
[90:50.64]A park?
[90:52.16]Yeah, you know, the park with all the roads circling around it?
[90:57.08]Chief said something about a couple of young punks duking it out with their robos.
[91:02.80]Yes, some girl called us up, asked us to make them stop.
[91:06.53]Hmm.
[91:06.75]Sounds messy.
[91:07.41]We should get moving.
[91:09.33]You're right.
[91:09.75]Come on.
[91:10.01]Let's go.
[91:10.35]Alright.
[91:19.15]Which one are you?
[91:20.75]There they are.
[91:21.27]Wonderful.
[91:21.81]What they're fighting about.
[91:23.61]I wonder why do I care about this?
[91:27.81]Why do I have to get involved?
[91:35.17]oh god oh my god no she's mine she's my date okay that where the land of the creeps okay I'm the one who called you these silly boys are fighting over me because I'm so cute
[91:59.64]Well, I mean, I guess I did tell them to go out.
[92:02.26]I did tell them I'd go out with them on the same day and time.
[92:05.56]Alright, this clearly is like a 45-year-old dude that wrote this dialog.
[92:13.42]But I didn't know which one to cancel, so I thought I'd just come out and see what happened.
[92:17.92]And while I was waiting, they saw each other and they started fighting over me.
[92:26.72]Well, what did you expect?
[92:28.74]So anyway, I'm like freaking out here.
[92:30.62]I called the police, but they said they didn't have enough men.
[92:34.66]I think you've got more than enough men already.
[92:36.85]But I'm not worried at all that you're here.
[92:40.95]And so I'm going to go home.
[92:42.01]Okay, I'll leave the rest up to someone.
[92:43.41]Now there's going to be two more people fighting over you?
[92:47.65]You've just increased the amount of people that are fighting over you now.
[92:51.34]There's four of us here.
[92:52.88]There was two.
[92:53.96]You've just increased the amount of humans here.
[92:56.62]Now I'm gonna go home.
[92:57.54]Hey, she left, but what about her dates?
[93:05.66]They're so mad at one another that they haven't even noticed that she dumped them.
[93:10.42]Oh well, let's face them one-on-one to try to chill them out a little.
[93:14.50]They'll pick a guy, I'll handle the other.
[93:18.78]What are we fighting for?
[93:30.23]What song is that?
[93:30.93]It's a Mario song.
[93:36.45]What the hell is it?
[93:41.94]It's the water theme.
[93:42.80]Yeah, okay.
[93:48.40]Oh, and I suppose you've got a date with her too?
[93:52.54]Okay, I'll straighten you out.
[93:56.20]Now I'm going to get kind of specific here on combat techniques.
[93:58.80]Here's another tutorial for you.
[94:00.28]The longer you hold the A button, the higher you'll jump.
[94:02.18]Tap the A button to do a short jump.
[94:03.82]You should try it out.
[94:04.54]Got it?
[94:04.76]Okay, thank you.
[94:07.76]Just do whatever you can do to beat him.
[94:09.94]It's a t-shirt.
[94:10.58]Alright, what do you got?
[94:20.17]Nice.
[94:20.65]Okay.
[94:21.34]Good.
[94:21.78]I put my thumb up.
[94:22.86]Good, dude.
[94:23.70]Good fucking job.
[94:25.30]Wicked good job.
[94:27.98]This is gonna be easy.
[94:30.36]And then I put the fucking VR helmet on.
[94:31.98]Alright.
[94:37.34]Keep Ray.
[94:39.61]Give him an IP.
[94:40.13]I don't like it.
[94:42.17]I want standard.
[94:44.45]Standard.
[94:45.07]Only standard.
[94:47.77]I like the standard ship.
[94:48.95]What's the cockroach?
[94:51.10]It normally flies slowly.
[94:52.46]It quickly increases its speed when it spots its target.
[94:56.38]I'll try a cockroach.
[94:58.87]That's boring to do standard everything.
[95:01.89]No, it's efficient.
[95:10.51]You're a basic bitch.
[95:12.58]Okay.
[95:20.76]Alright, get in there.
[95:22.84]Oh, there are little cockroaches.
[95:23.92]It's awesome.
[95:31.01]Get him!
[95:34.11]Ooh, that is pretty nice.
[95:41.64]Come on, what's up with that?
[95:49.58]Get him, get him, get him.
[95:50.34]Dash, dash, dash, dash.
[95:51.08]He's so close.
[95:51.56]Get him.
[96:00.98]Bash him.
[96:06.21]Dash, dance.
[96:06.93]Dash, dance.
[96:09.11]I'm working on it.
[96:11.19]That was pretty good.
[96:11.79]It just didn't hit him.
[96:14.27]I'm...
[96:19.38]Sorry, no date for you.
[96:25.83]Oh man, you mean losing in a fight against some dude?
[96:29.95]You mean I can't date her now?
[96:33.65]What does she think about this?
[96:36.29]Well, I do like you, but you lost in the battle, so now you're my boyfriend.
[96:41.73]What the, what?
[96:49.49]Good grief.
[96:49.83]Let's get out of here.
[96:52.77]Dead.
[96:53.11]Nope.
[96:59.93]Uh-oh.
[97:08.41]You'll pay for this.
[97:09.27]Thanks, Marcy.
[97:15.56]You saved me.
[97:17.28]Don't mention it.
[97:19.25]Oh, you must be Dale, our new partner, right?
[97:21.73]I'm Marcia.
[97:23.63]That takes four or five cans of spray, uh, hairspray to get that to be like that.
[97:29.16]Probably more.
[97:29.58]It's probably glue.
[97:33.14]Oh, um, well, I have class B license, Dale.
[97:37.20]Say, Dale, what's your license class?
[97:39.60]Oh, if I tell you if it's under B, you're not gonna date me?
[97:45.91]License was that.
[97:52.61]I mean, I have to do that one.
[97:54.47]License?
[97:54.95]What was that?
[97:56.09]What?
[97:58.27]You don't have a license?
[97:59.61]He's an amateur.
[98:02.55]Of course he ain't got no license.
[98:04.75]But if you're a bounty hunter and you don't have a license, you can get arrested.
[98:10.19]Oh, that's right.
[98:11.01]I forgot.
[98:13.67]Harry, how could you forget something like that?
[98:16.28]You know, that's why nobody's got any respect for the Steelhearts for getting stuff like that.
[98:24.90]Ah, give me a break.
[98:25.48]It just slipped my mind.
[98:29.04]Well, okay, I've got a problem.
[98:30.35]Let's head back to the office.
[98:34.21]Harry is low-key stupid.
[98:37.83]Uh, he's high-key stupid.
[98:42.64]New party member unlocked?
[98:48.14]A license?
[98:48.68]Oh, yeah, that.
[98:49.92]I guess that's not such a bad idea.
[98:52.42]But licenses cost money.
[98:53.74]Money we don't have.
[98:55.97]Yeah, but no matter how good you are, if you don't have a license, they'll arrest you.
[99:00.05]Well, that's your own business.
[99:01.33]It's not my fault if you guys get taken by the cops.
[99:05.47]I could have sworn that the law places full responsibility on an employer of a robo-commander.
[99:09.66]What?
[99:11.48]Are you serious?
[99:14.68]Alright, then.
[99:16.48]Alright, I want you to take him and get his license tomorrow.
[99:22.18]What, me again?
[99:22.98]Well, okay, he shouldn't have a problem getting a Class D license.
[99:27.51]A Class D license.
[99:29.83]That's burned in my brain.
[99:33.56]Sure.
[99:36.20]Sure, no problem.
[99:38.13]Hey, are you aware of what you have to go to do with the test?
[99:41.67]Anyway, take that Class D license test tomorrow.
[99:45.65]If you don't pass that license, Linda's reward is out the window.
[99:48.77]That's right.
[99:49.11]I'm not going to get anything.
[99:50.13]That's not to mention that it'll get you arrested.
[99:52.87]You're going to go to jail.
[99:53.49]You're going to go to jail for the rest of your life.
[99:54.85]Listen, Harry, you've absolutely got to make sure that he passes.
[100:00.71]It's impossible.
[100:01.31]What do you want a simple assistant like me to do?
[100:04.74]Stop complaining.
[100:05.68]It's not for Rick.
[100:07.94]Stop complaining.
[100:09.11]I don't want you to come back until our deal passes.
[100:11.53]What?
[100:12.89]You don't want me to die?
[100:13.91]Oh, the test.
[100:18.61]Right.
[100:20.95]Which reminds me, you're class D, too.
[100:23.23]Why don't you take the class C while you're there?
[100:25.56]Wait, he's class D?
[100:28.76]No way.
[100:29.28]Who do you think you're kidding?
[100:32.26]Jay Jameson.
[100:35.69]I want those photos.
[100:36.39]I want those photos of Spider-Man, and I want them tomorrow.
[100:40.45]You understand me, Peter?
[100:41.69]Get those photos of Spider-Man, or your job is toast.
[100:44.23]I'm getting out of my office.
[100:48.54]As long as I'm in this business, a Class D license is plenty.
[100:51.26]Hey, isn't it about time you took the Class A test?
[100:56.60]How many times have you tried? ...
[101:05.60]Oh, I'm so scared of something.
[101:09.86]This isn't good.
[101:12.08]Everyone's worked hard today.
[101:13.06]You can all go home.
[101:17.70]What a lazy fuck.
[101:19.96]He wouldn't even get up and walk.
[101:23.97]He left.
[101:27.01]You should go home too.
[101:27.87]Let's come straight to the test hall.
[101:30.37]The place is called the Custom Robo Department of Licensing.
[101:35.82]Dale, don't let anyone make fun of you for being a steel heart.
[101:39.58]Yeah, I won't.
[101:40.54]By the way, do you have any tips on that test I'm taking?
[101:45.80]This is John.
[101:46.14]I'm just doing John Wick the whole time.
[101:47.26]I'm realizing this is just Keanu Reeves.
[101:52.49]Right.
[101:52.87]Okay.
[101:57.21]Any tips on how to pass the test tomorrow?
[102:04.42]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[102:06.84]I've been saying that.
[102:08.36]I didn't see what you're doing.
[102:09.46]That's not even close.
[102:12.02]He uses Reddit.
[102:18.12]Okay, yes, I guess I use Reddit.
[102:23.43]She doesn't beat around the bush, does she?
[102:25.77]Dale, make sure you come straight to the testing hall.
[102:29.57]Okay, we're done for today.
[102:30.53]What are you doing after this?
[102:32.97]Miku, what are you doing?
[102:40.50]I'm tired, so I'm going home.
[102:42.54]See you tomorrow.
[102:43.88]Yeah, don't be late.
[102:51.42]He said it.
[102:52.48]I mean, that's the obvious reference to make.
[102:54.35]This is my voice acting audition stream.
[103:04.18]Don't you have that lying test today?
[103:06.24]You better get up if you don't want to be late.
[103:10.28]Lying?
[103:10.92]I wasn't lying.
[103:11.78]It tastes good.
[103:13.96]No, really.
[103:14.68]What are you babbling about?
[103:17.54]Wake up.
[103:17.94]Wake up.
[103:18.30]Wake up.
[103:18.66]Wake up.
[103:19.12]Wake up, Jeremy.
[103:19.84]Wake up.
[103:20.56]Chuck E. Cheese is here.
[103:26.25]What the hell am I talking about?
[103:32.55]Chuck E.
[103:34.19]I forgot that even happened.
[103:35.91]What a wild day.
[103:37.27]You got a reflection pod.
[103:39.23]You got a long frost leg.
[103:40.63]What?
[103:42.05]I want something.
[103:42.73]I fucking want something.
[103:47.44]Do I want?
[103:48.14]Should I?
[103:48.42]Okay.
[103:49.58]One's in the chat if I should get a coffee.
[103:51.82]Two's in the chat if I should eat a CBD edible.
[104:04.76]No.
[104:05.93]Two, two, two, two.
[104:12.83]Both?
[104:13.27]No, I don't want to do both.
[104:14.13]Fuck that.
[104:18.73]Good morning.
[104:19.15]Good luck with the test.
[104:20.73]Yeah, thanks.
[104:22.12]What a fucked up room.
[104:23.96]What do you have to lie about?
[104:25.34]No, it's not a lying test.
[104:28.34]It's a licensed test.
[104:30.80]How many times do I have to tell you that?
[104:33.95]I don't get all this robo mumbo jumbo.
[104:35.65]In order to work as a bounty hunter, you need a class D license.
[104:40.31]I'm going to take that test.
[104:44.67]It's all crazy talk to me, but it sounds like you don't pass this test.
[104:47.45]You don't keep your job.
[104:49.74]Yeah, that's right.
[104:52.92]Oh, that's terrible.
[104:53.86]Hurry and get going.
[104:55.66]Yeah.
[104:56.92]Where was it again?
[104:57.86]I think it was someplace called the Department of Licensing Test Hall.
[105:03.55]Oh, well, it's pretty easy to get there.
[105:05.29]Just go to the right when you leave.
[105:06.55]Are you sweeping the lawn?
[105:13.18]Grandma, I think, needs to go sit down in a chair.
[105:14.92]That's weird.
[105:18.28]No, I don't want to drink coffee.
[105:23.04]No, that's bad.
[105:24.96]Go right.
[105:25.60]Test hall.
[105:27.89]Alright, I gotta... Oh my fucking god.
[105:33.27]So, your name's Trish.
[105:34.91]That's a cute name.
[105:35.77]Oh, come on.
[105:36.83]How about it?
[105:37.35]Tell me your phone number.
[105:39.79]If something were to, you know, happen to you, I could rescue you.
[105:41.83]I'd even give you a discount.
[105:44.46]A discount?
[105:45.38]Is that supposed to impress me?
[105:47.28]Still, you've got kind of a naive charm.
[105:50.32]See, I am charming.
[105:51.42]Here, write it down here.
[105:52.34]Oh, sorry.
[105:57.11]I didn't know you were there, Dale.
[105:59.88]Just getting every single woman's phone number in the entire world.
[106:04.40]Everyone I talk to wants to give me their phone number.
[106:06.64]What did you do today?
[106:09.56]I got you registered.
[106:10.38]Leave the rest to me.
[106:11.08]Take your test.
[106:15.87]Stand in front of the exam machine and insert... I thought it was going to be insert your eyes.
[106:20.57]To put it simply, press the A button.
[106:24.01]Use your exam card.
[106:24.81]Don't lose it.
[106:25.27]By the way, could you write your number on it?
[106:30.01]So where were we?
[106:30.57]Oh yeah, write your number down there.
[106:31.81]What about this guy?
[106:38.26]In order to take the test, insert your exam card in RoboCube into the test machine.
[106:43.46]To begin the process, simply stand in front of the test machine and press A. Thanks, kid.

[110:24.19]Reflection.
[110:27.25]Doesn't chase your opponent, but travels around for a long period of time.
[110:31.33]Hmm.
[110:33.63]Try it.
[110:34.61]We got boots.
[110:35.23]Long thrust.
[110:37.69]Increases your dash distance.
[110:39.57]Features no descent augmentation.
[110:43.69]I'll try it.
[110:48.20]2.6 GPA won't get you into community college.
[110:51.22]It did 14 years ago.
[110:55.56]So, guys, I didn't just go to college yesterday.
[110:59.06]I didn't just get out of school.
[111:01.46]I've been graduated from college for like 15 years.
[111:05.70]It's been a very long time.
[111:15.47]2.6 is... That's not the GPA that I had to get in to college.
[111:19.39]It's the GPA I had in college.
[111:22.45]And look, we all get the same damn diploma, okay?
[111:30.33]Good start.
[111:31.11]Good start!
[111:36.58]Unbelievable start.
[111:50.59]Average grades.
[111:52.69]Yeah, guess what?
[111:53.21]I still got the diploma.
[111:56.51]Every one thing was like, oh wow, 2.6 GPA.
[111:59.41]Oh no, you didn't make the Dean's List.
[112:01.95]No, okay, and who cares?
[112:04.58]I don't like greet people that I'm just meeting for the first time like 15 years later going, ah, yeah, Jeremy Elbertson, nice to meet you.
[112:11.20]Ah, Dean's List.
[112:14.42]I don't fucking care.
[112:23.62]You would if you were on it, OMEGALUL.
[112:29.78]No.
[112:31.62]No.
[112:32.24]Alright.
[112:33.76]I'm gonna be real with you here.
[112:35.98]I remember getting the Dean's List.
[112:38.70]It was like, oh here, by the way, here are the people on the Dean's List.
[112:41.00]And it was just like, fucking, it was just like a thousand names.
[112:47.08]Sorry, I didn't get put on that list.
[112:49.78]It was like the, it was like the credits in a movie.
[112:56.88]Nobody that gets that paper in the mail scrolls down and goes, who is this?
[113:02.18]Who is it?
[113:02.50]Who are you?
[113:03.22]Ooh, Jeremy Halbertson.
[113:05.46]He made it.
[113:06.26]He made it.
[113:06.72]I know him.
[113:08.06]No.
[113:09.54]You show it to your parents.
[113:10.62]Your parents go, excellent work.
[113:13.19]And then you forget it existed ever again.
[113:17.09]And then your parents forget it existed like a month later.
[113:22.17]Like six months later.
[113:23.03]It's like, oh, you're just a person now.
[113:29.63]He's mad.
[113:30.55]I'm not going to get my intelligence just killed here.
[113:36.89]I just got a class D license.
[113:38.65]He's getting clapped.
[113:41.31]What?
[113:45.09]Cool.
[113:45.41]So I'll give you a call tonight.
[113:46.49]Hey, did you pass?
[113:49.83]0.6.
[113:55.77]It doesn't even matter.
[114:02.09]See you later, Trish.
[114:10.85]What you should be caring about is not about how high your GPA is, but what you are retaining from the shit that you want to learn.
[114:20.97]That's way more important than having like a 4.0 GPA.
[114:26.24]How much are you taking?
[114:27.08]How much are you retaining?
[114:27.62]How many skills are you developing?
[114:28.70]Develop some skills.
[114:29.57]Develop some brain power.
[114:31.13]Oh, I didn't get it.
[114:31.97]I got a D on this.
[114:32.91]Who fucking cares?
[114:33.65]You got a D on that test?
[114:34.75]Who gives a shit?
[114:36.09]What did you learn?
[114:39.53]When my son or daughter goes to college, and they come back and they're like, Dad, I got like a 2.1, 2.2.
[114:46.81]Let me see that.
[114:48.03]Let me see.
[114:49.51]Okay, alright.
[114:50.21]What did you learn, though?
[114:51.96]Show me what you've learned.
[114:55.51]And then they'll pull out like a piano and like start playing a fucking beautiful song.
[114:58.17]And I'll be like, there you go.
[114:58.97]That's what you've learned.
[114:59.63]Whatever you're doing.
[115:00.17]I don't care.
[115:00.43]Whatever it is.
[115:00.87]Good work.
[115:04.41]What are you retaining?
[115:05.63]Not what are you remembering?
[115:07.35]That's way more important.
[115:09.52]Think about that.
[115:11.08]Tests.
[115:12.04]A test.
[115:13.04]What are you retaining versus what are you remembering?
[115:19.28]Short term to get a passing grade.
[115:23.16]Keep that in mind.
[115:23.74]It's very, very important.
[115:36.67]It's too bad employers don't think like that.
[115:39.43]Some of them do.
[115:43.74]Some of them do.
[115:48.82]Omega Q. Alright, you want to talk about productivity and what makes a good employment environment?
[115:59.49]This should be a four-day work week.
[116:01.35]You know how much more shit people get done not spending five, six days a week?
[116:05.95]You get way more shit done.
[116:16.69]But you get a 15-minute break every eight hours here at the job.
[116:22.01]You're stressing out.
[116:23.85]You've got too much stuff to do.
[116:25.37]You're not being able to take breaks.
[116:27.41]Your mind can't function that way.
[116:31.24]We need four goddamn work weeks.
[116:32.86]I'm not talking less work, by the way.
[116:34.38]I'm not talking everybody should do less.
[116:37.94]You get way more done when you have less time.
[116:41.52]It's weird, but it's true.
[116:43.88]When you're working for less time, you have more time to spread out your brain and be able to actually develop your brain off work.
[116:55.57]Trust me, it's scientific.
[116:56.71]Look it up.
[117:02.94]Not 14 hours a day.
[117:04.36]No.
[117:05.06]Same time, less days.
[117:12.84]Unionize your workplace.
[117:14.06]Thanks for the five subs.
[117:16.86]We're not talking about any... We're not talking... I'm just talking about productivity.
[117:20.17]Alright?
[117:26.13]And why do you have the mods work 100 plus hours a week?
[117:29.03]SHUT UP!
[117:33.18]Hey, I'm kidding.
[117:37.06]You should... No, dude.
[117:39.80]We'll talk about that later.
[117:42.44]Good job.
[117:45.32]I've got some business to take care of.
[117:46.68]I want to leave right now.
[117:55.69]If you two are going to be partners, you ought to spend some quality time together.
[117:59.31]Chat on the way home and get to know each other.
[118:02.06]That dude is drinking his own tears.
[118:03.88]He is ugly crying.
[118:33.93]Okay, uh... I gotta be honest, I was not... Hey, I was not retaining any of that information.
[118:40.29]I was just saying it or remembering it short-term.
[118:43.07]What happened there?
[118:43.77]I don't know.
[118:44.17]Where am I going?
[118:45.21]I didn't retain any of that.
[118:52.51]Not even short-term.
[118:59.15]I didn't fail the test.
[119:02.32]You were talking during it.
[119:03.86]I was talking during the test.
[119:06.32]Where do we need to go?
[119:07.19]Training gym?
[119:10.89]What's the square root of 16?
[119:13.25]I don't know.
[119:17.65]I don't care.
[119:20.01]Where were we actually going?
[119:22.96]I was not paying a single attention at all.
[119:24.62]Was it the training grounds?
[119:28.52]It was about go to Marcia, right?
[119:32.20]Go home?
[119:33.56]Alright, spend quality time with this person.
[119:35.14]Alright, let's go bowling or something.
[119:40.94]Don't tell him.
[119:41.42]What do you mean, don't tell him?
[119:45.30]Tell me.
[119:45.60]Hmm, you're dad, huh?
[119:47.86]And that's why you want to work.
[119:49.66]Well, everyone's got a reason.
[119:51.36]Anyway, as of today, you're a full-fledged bounty hunter.
[119:53.86]Do your best.
[119:54.46]See ya.
[120:02.24]Okay, gotta get back home and call Trish.
[120:04.08]Is that Trish's number?
[120:13.62]Is that the comic relief there that that's the number that he dropped, I guess?
[120:17.97]Yeah.
[120:25.89]Dale, get up.
[120:27.43]Hurry up and go to work.
[120:40.78]This person only has two outfits.
[120:42.80]That's sort of strange.
[120:45.76]Feather legs.
[120:47.56]Betcha I can fly.
[120:56.68]What do you call this?
[121:01.36]I don't know!
[121:03.70]They're being awfully loud this morning.
[121:06.72]Do I care?
[121:11.13]I know you're curious, but it's not right to go poking around in other people's business.
[121:14.65]I'll do it later.
[121:15.53]Okay.
[121:21.91]Good morning.
[121:42.93]Now you just got your deal, but I need you to go back to your apartment.
[121:45.91]Huh?
[121:47.74]There's a married couple fighting over at your apartment building, and they're using robos.
[121:52.72]I got a call from the landlady.
[121:54.36]She said it's out of her control.
[121:55.68]She requested you specifically.
[121:59.98]I thought so.
[122:01.19]Hey, Harry, go with them.
[122:04.07]I'm fine.
[122:04.81]It sounds like a crummy job.
[122:07.32]Dale can handle it by himself.
[122:09.94]I'm totally bummed today.
[122:11.08]I had my chance yesterday and I blew it.
[122:15.34]Stop complaining and go.
[122:16.86]Yeah, yeah, okay, I'll go.
[122:21.94]Oh, Trish.
[122:24.07]Oh, where did I put that note with your number on it?
[122:28.87]Ah.
[122:42.21]Alright, dude.
[122:47.37]Come on.
[122:58.04]Hi, thanks for coming back, Dale.
[123:00.95]When did you call Ernest?
[123:03.09]Right after you left.
[123:03.87]It's so awful.
[123:05.51]Who's this?
[123:07.31]Oh, that's Harry.
[123:09.12]Oh, really?
[123:09.62]Is he a stolen horse too?
[123:12.10]Oh.
[123:13.94]That's what her hands are doing.
[123:15.33]He's quite a hunk of a man.
[123:16.65]Give me his number, will you?
[123:20.51]It's sweet of you.
[123:21.95]Can we talk about the job here?
[123:25.97]What's going on?
[123:27.83]Oh, right, right.
[123:28.99]Walt and his wife are fighting, and it's getting crazy.
[123:32.01]They're using their robos to fight, and their children are crying.
[123:35.31]I tried to stop them, but I don't know a thing about robos.
[123:39.64]You know that?
[123:40.34]I didn't have a clue how to stop them, and that's why I called Stolen Horse.
[123:47.66]I actually wanted to see what you were like when you had work.
[123:50.19]Thanks.
[123:54.14]Dale, let's cut the chat and go stop him.
[123:58.79]Yeah, you're right.
[124:00.73]Good luck.
[124:01.25]It's turning into Roger.
[124:08.91]Man, this is bad.
[124:10.84]Let's wrap this up quickly.
[124:13.58]I'll stop the husband.
[124:15.80]You go handle his wife.
[124:17.08]It's turning into either Roger or Neelix.
[124:19.58]It turns back and forth somehow.
[124:23.68]I've turned the safety switch on so that nobody gets hurt.
[124:28.68]What's a safety switch?
[124:31.42]It's a switch that describes, decreases your robo's power to prevent you from hurting your opponent.
[124:37.48]The switch is on the robo cube.
[124:38.82]If you turn the safety switch on and dive, the safety mechanics will automatically kick in.
[124:43.04]It won't look any different.
[124:44.82]Okay.
[124:49.85]Can we get, should we do an investigation?
[124:54.45]Let's get along yeah, stop fighting Holy shit
[125:16.13]What?
[125:16.63]You're taking his side?
[125:18.89]Don't mess with me.
[125:21.29]I'll beat you to a pulp with my metal ape.
[125:24.13]It's a metal grappler.
[125:26.51]Little grappler?
[125:29.88]Got a little excited there.
[125:31.60]The metal grappler has extremely high defense.
[125:35.04]It's hard for it to get knocked down, but since it moves slow, I have a hard time dodging attack.
[125:40.04]I can only do one air dash.
[125:43.24]Oh, I'm gonna lean in real close.
[125:45.54]I usually focus on attacking rather than worrying about a little damage.
[125:49.55]Got it?
[125:55.89]Got it.
[125:57.29]Huh?
[126:01.38]Why am I explaining all of this to you?
[126:03.38]Yeah, why are you telling me this?
[126:10.74]Got a cool sword.
[126:16.57]Alright.
[126:17.37]So, just hide.
[126:20.41]I like this.
[126:21.19]I currently like this.
[126:24.15]Battle!
[126:24.73]Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of that line, by the way.
[126:28.49]You require my assistance?
[126:30.45]I could do a better job than that.
[126:31.97]You require my assistance?
[126:34.65]Battle!
[126:36.23]That's better.
[126:36.55]That's what he sounded like in Warcraft 3.
[126:40.93]I would've done.
[126:41.29]Just replace it.
[126:51.26]What an egomaniac.
[126:55.22]Don't say that.
[126:55.84]Don't say that or you're going to get fucking banned.
[127:00.13]The dash is way better.
[127:01.43]Send out the mice.
[127:10.82]We just have to dodge.
[127:11.68]This is an ape type, right?
[127:19.98]Knocked him down.
[127:21.34]Good volley.
[127:23.98]Thermal punching.
[127:24.68]Fuck you.
[127:26.98]Don't use me against me, okay?
[127:28.42]Don't forget, that's me punching you.
[127:32.84]I'm going to punch myself.
[127:36.27]Careful with that emote.
[127:38.11]There's lava in this thing.
[127:55.15]Stop hitting yourself.
[127:56.05]Stop hitting yourself.
[128:03.82]That was clean.
[128:22.98]Grandma slaps himself.
[128:24.04]Why are you doing that?
[128:24.60]Nobody has raided.
[128:25.28]We don't have a raid.
[128:28.66]Why are you embarrassing me in front of a raid that doesn't exist?
[128:31.82]Vertical gun.
[128:42.15]Ow, ow, ow.
[128:43.09]Right, that burns me up.
[128:47.20]That was a waste of time.
[128:48.20]Let's head back to the office.
[128:52.07]Ow, ow, ow.
[128:53.33]Are you hurt, dear?
[128:54.29]Who hurt you?
[128:56.37]That crudely dressed punk over there.
[128:59.61]What are you talking about?
[129:00.53]You're hurt because you got into a stupid fight with your wife.
[129:03.51]I only calmed you down.
[129:04.49]How dare you hurt my hubby?
[129:09.31]Get up, dear.
[129:10.21]We'll defeat these evil villains and show them that our love is strong.
[129:15.08]That's right.
[129:15.90]I love you.
[129:18.36]I love you, too.
[129:28.03]Why does this have to happen to me?
[129:29.11]I'm just some guy.
[129:30.33]Hey, Dale, come here.
[129:32.69]We're gonna beat him up.
[129:36.88]You never had a two-on-two battle before, have you?
[129:38.86]It's when two people team up on two others.
[129:41.40]What are you doing?
[129:43.12]Sorry, just wait one minute.
[129:44.20]I have to explain to the new guy.
[129:46.18]Hey, Dale, listen carefully.
[129:47.04]I'll explain two-on-two battles.
[129:50.58]At least they're aware, right?
[129:52.72]The basic controls are the same as the one-on-one battles, but there's one difference.
[129:56.53]The arrow on top of your robot's head locks onto one of your opponents.
[130:00.78]You want to change your target if you press Y. Okay, good thing I didn't skip that.
[130:12.85]You're red and I'm blue and our opponents are green and yellow.
[130:15.75]Every time you press Y, the colored arrow above the changes and it goes that way.
[130:19.03]Okay.
[130:20.17]I told you I'm blue.
[130:21.29]What good does it do to shoot your own partner?
[130:23.23]You can't fire your gun while you're changing targets.
[130:26.39]Are you done yet?
[130:28.19]Sorry, there's just a little bit more.
[130:29.87]One more second.
[130:31.57]Your opponents have colored arrows over their heads too.
[130:33.95]When those arrows turn red, that means that they're locked on to you.
[130:38.36]Got it?
[130:39.06]Got it.
[130:40.58]Got it.
[130:41.46]Now listen.
[130:42.44]Look carefully at the colored arrows and see who's locked on to who.
[130:44.94]Keep that in mind while you fight.
[130:46.70]Alright, Nightbot just said I've been live for 2 hours and 11 minutes.
[130:52.79]I thought someone was chatting saying, Jerma, it's been 2 hours and 11 minutes, ResidentSleeper.
[131:03.08]Actually, this is... I like this.
[131:07.48]I'm gonna stay with what I got.
[131:08.34]I like it.
[131:12.62]Oh, by the way, tomorrow... Tomorrow is part two of DLC Movie Night.
[131:20.37]And watch the rest of the playlist.
[131:24.41]I'm already up.
[131:27.20]Wait, is that my friend?
[131:28.76]No, no, it's not.
[131:32.01]This is a little confusing.
[131:33.09]Alright, I'm with this guy.

[131:53.21]Attack him.
[131:54.61]Yes.
[131:54.79]Yes.
[132:04.81]They got the big guy first.
[132:06.15]Focus the big guy.
[132:07.23]What are you, dumb?
[132:08.57]Alright, that's it.
[132:20.38]Don't even let him get up.
[132:26.02]I'll just rain missiles.
[132:26.78]You just do all the work.

[133:08.39]Are you two okay?
[133:10.69]What are you doing here, Marcia?
[133:13.05]The chief was worried about you.
[133:14.28]He said... Where is this going?
[133:16.84]I'm not sure where this is going.
[133:18.08]It's going somewhere.
[133:18.90]I don't know where it was.
[133:20.88]I guess we're just going to do this.
[133:22.80]The chief was worried about you.
[133:23.84]He said you weren't your normal self today.
[133:27.87]Well, you've got perfect timing.
[133:29.11]It's all over.
[133:30.63]I see.
[133:32.05]But how do things turn so ugly so quickly?
[133:38.44]That's what I like to know, man.
[133:39.48]What a mess.
[133:42.69]I was washing my husband's clothes this morning and I found a note in his coat pocket.
[133:46.81]There was a phone number on it.
[133:48.69]I didn't know what it was.
[133:49.67]I called it and a young lady answered.
[133:51.71]I was certain that my husband was cheating on me.
[133:56.04]But honey, I told you I just found that note out front this morning.
[133:59.98]I believe you.
[134:00.70]You'd never do anything like that.
[134:02.72]I'm sorry I lost my temper.
[134:04.26]I'm sure it was only a prank.
[134:07.88]Really?
[134:08.95]Who would have planted that thing out where you'd fight it like that?
[134:11.61]Prank or no prank?
[134:14.51]I hope you're sorry.
[134:15.75]We're bruised up because of your stupid fight.
[134:20.01]Harry, please stop.
[134:21.75]There are children here and you're scaring them.
[134:24.35]I'll get them.
[134:27.38]I'm the murloc.
[134:27.92]What's from the game Hearthstone?
[134:36.65]What's his name?
[134:38.11]Sir Finley, right?
[134:39.07]Sir Finley.
[134:39.61]I've played... Look, every stream is the... Every stream is the last thing that I did.
[134:44.13]Okay?
[134:46.13]The last thing that I did, you guys are gonna hear about it.
[134:48.33]All day.
[134:49.61]Every time.
[134:52.91]What do you want me to do?
[134:54.43]It's just up there, and I can't get it out.
[134:55.73]I mean, I don't like it.
[134:57.29]I think the game's stupid now.
[134:58.49]But, like, I played it, and that's all that's up there.
[135:00.09]I can't help it.
[135:07.72]This is how memories work.
[135:14.19]Fucking boomer loser.
[135:16.09]Alright.
[135:18.29]You get some leeway.
[135:20.07]But, alright.
[135:22.01]That's time out for ten minutes.
[135:24.50]Time out for ten minutes.
[135:29.60]First ready for some adventure.
[135:56.82]CBD!
[135:57.94]CBD!
[135:59.08]CBD!
[136:05.99]I'm going to get a water.
[136:06.93]Relax.
[139:02.68]Okay.
[139:03.40]I'm back.
[139:04.42]Got a glass of water.
[139:06.52]And I got some coffee.
[139:09.72]Just a little bit more.
[139:18.56]Weed-infused coffee.
[139:19.66]That would be... I'm not a fan of that kind of stuff.
[139:22.87]I don't... Like, just... I'm just gonna... Just give it to me.
[139:24.93]I want to eat it.
[139:25.39]I don't want, like, weed-infused fucking, like, salmon fillets.
[139:30.61]No, I don't want that.
[139:33.14]I don't want like a weed-infused coke product.
[139:35.38]No, just give it to me.
[139:36.62]I'll eat it.
[139:36.94]If you're into that stuff, cool.
[139:40.64]Cool.
[139:41.66]I'm glad you are.
[139:42.28]I just want to eat it.
[139:49.68]Weed and cocaine mixed together.
[139:52.70]No, don't do that.
[139:53.60]That's a terrible idea.
[139:56.02]Don't do that.
[139:57.78]We found this in front of our front doorstep.
[140:08.02]Stop blinking me the mustache hair guy.
[140:10.38]I saw it.
[140:10.94]Looks like it was written by a girl.
[140:13.36]She has cute handwriting.
[140:20.78]Cute?
[140:21.74]Let me see.
[140:22.22]Whoa.
[140:27.00]I'll take this as evidence.
[140:27.86]Give me that.
[140:35.40]Modded 3D movie maker characters.
[140:36.82]Got it.
[140:37.20]Figured it out.
[140:37.64]It's taken me a while.
[140:38.52]That's what this is.
[140:40.54]It's nothing.
[140:41.30]I can't let a helpless girl carry around a heavy load, you know.
[140:46.87]It's just a piece of paper.
[140:48.69]It's great everything worked out.
[140:49.81]Don't they look good together?
[140:50.87]And they lived happily ever after.
[140:52.09]Harry, are you alright?
[140:57.04]Huh?
[140:58.34]What do you mean?
[140:59.64]Just a second ago, you were furious, but now... Furious?
[141:01.76]Who, me?
[141:02.38]Nah, I'm made of love.
[141:03.42]Hey, Dale, you need to lighten up?
[141:05.95]Married couples have their reasons for things.
[141:07.73]You gotta give them some slack.
[141:11.77]Got it.
[141:14.61]Okay, kids.
[141:16.71]Are you scared?
[141:17.59]Your parents are fine now.
[141:18.85]Everything's alright.
[141:21.04]Listen to me when I'm talking.
[141:22.82]We're talking to the children now, Harry.
[141:25.56]Stop.
[141:25.84]Come on, let's go play over there.
[141:30.48]Marcia.
[141:32.80]You both want to be commanders when you grow up?
[141:34.60]How about a custom robo game?
[141:38.54]Sheesh.
[141:41.25]What's wrong?
[141:41.81]Surprised to see Marcia being nice to the kids?
[141:47.23]Um, I don't care.
[141:49.41]I don't care at all.
[141:50.88]Like, that's cool.
[141:51.92]Nice.
[141:52.38]Why would you not be nice to kids?
[141:53.42]I don't care.
[141:56.36]Come on, hear me out.
[141:57.02]She's actually a nice person.
[141:58.18]I... Okay.
[142:00.33]You see... Time to lore dump on you.
[142:03.33]Marcia's parents passed away a few years ago.
[142:05.45]It was just her and her big brother.
[142:06.73]Her big brother was an elite member of the police squad.
[142:08.67]Marcia got along well with her brother real well.
[142:10.45]Her brother took good care of her.
[142:11.75]But one day, Marcia's brother up and quit the police squad without a word.
[142:14.73]And then he just disappeared and no one's seen him since.
[142:16.28]Okay.
[142:19.16]Um, then... Okay, not only did Marcia lose her parents, but she also lost an older brother.
[142:23.62]That's...
[142:25.51]I don't think this is the appropriate place to do this.
[142:28.19]Like, in this house here.
[142:31.99]And now she's alone.
[142:32.85]Yeah, that sort of sums it up.
[142:37.04]This is like a situation where we leave and you pull me aside.
[142:40.40]And say, hey, just want to let you know a couple things.
[142:44.64]He's just monologuing in this person's living room.
[142:49.52]I feel the same way.
[142:50.24]For a long time, Marcia has been gifted with a strange power.
[142:53.47]Uh-oh.
[142:55.66]oh that girl's got a strange power she's like a god she has god powers and and she I got it I got it because of that she's always been the quiet type she used to be a lot happier and now she's lost her parents and her big brother shut out from the world and unable to reach out to anyone she's gotten a lot better though
[143:19.17]The reason Marcia wants a Class A license is because she wants to join the police squad.
[143:22.73]You can't join the police squad unless you get a Class A license.
[143:25.68]How was I supposed to know that?
[143:26.40]I failed that on the test.
[143:27.22]She probably wants to track down some clues on her brother herself.
[143:43.67]They left.
[143:47.35]How do I uncook Luigi?
[143:48.91]I accidentally dropped him in the deep fryer.
[143:50.67]Uh, well, you're going to be in big trouble.
[143:53.79]Because that's half of Nintendo's entire fanbase.
[144:00.51]And library.
[144:01.21]You're going to have to come up with a solution for that.
[144:12.83]What am I saying?
[144:13.76]Somebody said that!
[144:19.63]I didn't say that.
[144:21.09]Would you guys think that I'm saying this?
[144:24.49]Oh, shit, I did say it.
[144:25.37]Like, I just said it.
[144:26.97]Yes, they did say that.
[144:28.29]I will find it right now before I get still lost in the chat.
[144:33.30]I'm just, like, insane.
[144:35.04]And I'm sitting here going, okay, how do I uncook Luigi, guys?
[144:37.76]I dropped him in the fryer.
[144:42.04]I gotta find it.
[144:43.00]Somebody fucking really said that, and it was fucked.
[144:51.10]Okay, it's gone.
[144:54.50]Okay, let's head back to the office.
[144:55.66]Awesome, I got Trish's number back.
[144:59.60]Yeah!
[145:04.48]So, Jerma owns the game and he'd rather emulate it.
[145:06.89]Am I wrong?
[145:08.97]Um, Mike, listen.
[145:10.89]Sometimes some games have problems being captured.
[145:14.26]They become uncapturable.
[145:16.85]Happens with a lot of them, actually.
[145:18.83]Try to pull it through a capture device and the audio might be all messed up.
[145:21.51]There could be a huge problem.
[145:22.65]The disk could be scratched.
[145:23.79]Doesn't mean you don't own it.
[145:26.78]No, not all of them.
[145:27.70]Excuse me.
[145:28.98]Excuse me, not all of them.
[145:30.64]Only like three ever.
[145:36.58]Hold on, it's on the phone.
[145:38.99]Hello, Chief.
[145:39.81]Yes, Harry and Dale took care of it.
[145:41.97]Hurry up and head over to Bogie's Cafe.
[145:44.17]Marv's there.
[145:45.05]More characters.
[145:47.73]Show disk.
[145:48.57]I don't have to do that because I know I have... Fucking God.
[145:52.87]No, this is a gaslight bullshit.
[145:54.81]I'm not doing it.
[145:55.21]If we catch that Marv, we should get a big reward.
[145:59.34]If the police squad gets there before you, the reward's gone.
[146:02.78]Hurry up.
[146:05.19]You need to show us the disk.
[146:06.77]You need to show us the disk.
[146:15.25]Alright.
[146:15.65]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[146:17.05]Alright.
[146:17.79]Here's the disk.
[146:22.63]Okay.
[146:22.85]Let me show you.
[146:24.71]Hold on, folks.
[146:30.23]Hey, here we go.
[146:33.62]Dick reveal incoming.
[146:35.04]Disk reveal.
[146:36.40]Disk reveal.
[146:40.76]No, stop.
[146:44.24]You have to show this.
[146:45.64]I don't have to do anything.
[146:47.85]It looks like I'm going to, right?
[146:51.43]How did my headphones get tangled?
[146:55.83]Prepare to screenshot.
[146:57.21]Why does this matter?
[147:00.05]Hold on.
[147:02.09]Where's the camera?
[147:05.51]My camera's broken.
[147:06.31]Remember from yesterday?
[147:06.99]Hold on.
[147:16.26]What the fuck?
[147:20.13]Why is it so tiny?
[147:20.99]Can you guys see me?
[147:39.05]Why is this so small?
[147:39.95]Alright, alright, alright, I got it, I got it, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[147:51.80]I know everyone's gonna freak out, I'm wearing the same shirt that I was wearing yesterday.
[147:55.26]I don't care.
[147:58.54]I'm wearing the same clothes as yesterday, what the fuck do I care?
[148:00.59]Why am I like a ghost?
[148:03.83]Why am I a ghost?
[148:08.04]Okay, here we go.
[148:08.70]You ready?
[148:13.05]What do we have here?
[148:14.51]What do we have here?
[148:16.73]What is this?
[148:18.67]Hmm?
[148:20.09]This looks like a GameCube disk of Custom Robo, doesn't it?
[148:22.85]By the way, here's the controller.
[148:25.15]Here's the controller.
[148:25.81]It's the GameCube controller, by the way.
[148:27.01]I don't want you to see this.
[148:31.49]Oh, what's this?
[148:34.73]What's this fucking thing?
[148:39.35]What is, uh, what is, what is this?
[148:43.45]Is this a, is this a Wii?
[148:49.89]It looks like it.
[149:06.96]It's a router.
[149:13.90]It's a router.
[149:17.68]I have that.
[149:18.56]That's the Netgear 2000, man.
[149:23.46]Not plugged in.
[149:24.30]Not plugged in.
[149:25.74]Not plugged in.
[149:26.94]I have the disk.
[149:27.56]I have to prove that to people, apparently.
[149:30.35]I'm sorry, everybody that was waiting for me to play the game.
[149:33.71]I'm sorry.
[149:34.33]Yell at them.
[149:39.59]flexing on your viewers, but proving that I own the game, the console, and the controller?
[149:50.56]Okay, here we go.
[149:51.14]The chief wants us to go to bogeys.
[149:52.80]That guy is the reward.
[149:55.34]Alright, I'm gonna do us all a favor.
[150:03.61]I like my co-
[150:13.17]No, skipping Miku, no!
[150:18.86]How do I unpoop my pants?
[150:21.38]Waddle over to the toilet, take your underwear off, and just take the underwear and turn it upside down and dump it into the toilet and then just throw the underwear in the trash.
[150:29.63]Done.
[150:32.47]His name is Evil.
[150:37.81]Huh?
[150:38.31]Harry and Marcia.
[150:39.89]No, I can give it a...
[150:41.36]Harry and Marcia, what's going on?
[150:44.83]Oh great, not him.
[150:47.09]Harry, Harry, Harry, still have the manners of a kindergarten, eh?
[150:52.11]I assume you're here for the notorious outlaw Marv.
[150:57.22]I'm sorry, but you're too late.
[150:59.26]Dark Blue, or more specifically, I, Evil, have already captured the rogue.
[151:06.48]Darn it.
[151:07.54]Dark Blue got the reward.
[151:14.31]But how did you know that Marv was here?
[151:16.95]So, you want to learn my secrets?
[151:19.71]You hope to benefit from my wisdom, perhaps?
[151:22.61]Okay, I'll tell you.
[151:23.65]Want to know something weird about voices and acting and just hearing people talk very loudly?
[151:29.45]I'm going to ruin every single thing for you ever.
[151:33.20]You are now going to hear all the huge intakes of air when people do voice acting now.
[151:42.78]It's all you're going to hear.
[151:45.23]Even when you watch the news, you're not going to hear the breath.
[151:50.13]When newscasters talk, especially anchors or reporters, just listen.
[151:56.35]So we are here live on the scene and I'm here.
[151:59.35]You'll hear it.
[152:01.19]It turns out the car drove past all these.
[152:03.98]Yeah.
[152:06.16]It happens now.
[152:07.38]That's all you'll hear.
[152:10.84]Don't listen.
[152:11.48]Don't listen.
[152:18.68]That's not how normal people breathe, just listen next time.
[152:22.84]I'm gonna drive somebody insane.
[152:24.36]Because he's gonna- people are gonna be like, no!
[152:28.91]No, he's right, it's the only thing I can hear.
[152:36.09]Bogey here officially requested the services of my little mercenary crew.
[152:39.47]Dark- now I'm freaking out because you're gonna hear it.
[152:42.92]What?
[152:43.50]Bogey, why?
[152:45.06]But you told us you always go to Steelhearts when you've got trouble.
[152:53.60]Well, your boss has been here all day, sucking down coffee and... And what?
[152:59.75]And he was sitting in a dark corner all by himself, writing poetry and occasionally weeping.
[153:06.01]How can I rely on you guys when your boss is such a space cadet?
[153:10.35]Poetry?
[153:11.94]I'd be worried too.
[153:16.06]Young Ernest is a poet and you didn't know it?
[153:20.10]Oh, this is too shit!
[153:21.90]It's all I hear.
[153:30.89]I did it myself.
[153:34.37]Well, now, aren't you the kid who came in looking for a job with Dark Blue not too long ago?
[153:38.22]Of course, that's right.
[153:40.38]Your name's Dale.
[153:42.80]You apply to Dark Blue, too?
[153:45.68]Yeah, I apply to lots of places.
[153:51.26]I applied a lot.
[153:51.94]This is not me making a joke.
[153:52.90]This is real life now.
[153:54.93]Don't act coy.
[153:55.67]Evil knows your name.
[153:56.43]You must have applied at Dark Blue.
[153:59.03]So you couldn't get into Dark Blue and were next on your list?
[154:02.67]Fine with me.
[154:04.85]Oh, what is with you?
[154:06.29]Ceaseless blathering.
[154:07.63]Harry, are you saying you know Dale too?
[154:11.03]Wait, don't tell me.
[154:13.73]Did Steelheart hire this amateur?
[154:16.63]That is rich.
[154:25.69]Shut your face.
[154:28.81]Dale has tons of talent and someday he'll be an excellent commander.
[154:33.94]At least that's what Linda says.
[154:36.06]I have to stop paying attention.
[154:37.96]Alright.
[154:38.60]I need 30 seconds to recalibrate and just forget about the thing that I just told you guys.
[154:42.78]It's fucking up my brain.
[154:52.58]I've got an idea.
[154:55.07]Somebody said he sounds like a skipping CD.
[154:59.53]Oh, he sounds like a skipping... What did you say?
[155:03.47]Breathe and blink manually.
[155:13.74]Stop it.
[155:15.38]Why did I do this to myself?
[155:16.48]I casted a spell back at myself accidentally.
[155:21.62]And all of you in chat are going to have one arm now.
[155:24.84]And it bounced back in a mirror.
[155:26.66]Oh, shit.
[155:29.31]I have one arm now.
[155:36.89]Reversed.
[155:38.17]Yeah, I've got a few verses for you right here.
[155:44.55]Oh, very witty, Harry.
[155:45.55]Have you ever considered a change of career, perhaps as a clown?
[155:50.07]Enough chit-chat.
[155:50.73]We're leaving now.
[155:53.65]Dale, if you do turn out to be a worthy commander, we'll make you an offer.
[156:02.20]Don't make a Hearthstone reference.
[156:03.38]Don't do it.
[156:03.78]I'm gonna do it.
[156:04.51]Don't make the Hearthstone.
[156:05.51]Say it, Dr. Boom.
[156:06.57]Fuck.
[156:11.11]Harry, let's go back to the office.
[156:12.07]We need to report this to the chief.
[156:14.89]Yeah, you're right.
[156:19.54]The last thing I did is the only thing I've done.
[156:23.88]You -2 suck.
[156:25.34]-2.
[156:25.86]You can't do two.
[156:26.76]Come on.
[156:28.26]Come on.
[156:30.82]Alright, we get to report back to our stupid chief.
[156:32.86]I didn't get to play the game.
[156:34.44]That was just a ton of exposition.
[156:47.35]Steel hearts.
[156:52.21]What?
[156:53.31]So let me get this straight.
[156:54.51]Not only do you not catch Marv, but you let Dark Blue nab the ransom?
[157:00.56]You know, that's why everyone keeps making fun of us.
[157:03.66]If we'd caught Marv, we'd have gotten a huge reward.
[157:07.04]So what in the world took you so... for any good poems lately?
[157:12.66]Hey, what?
[157:13.59]Bogey called in Dark Blue.
[157:16.89]Bogey said he didn't want to hire someone who'd rather write poems than catch felons.
[157:25.65]What?
[157:26.93]Uh-oh.
[157:31.79]Well, these things happen.
[157:33.77]Good work, everyone.
[157:34.97]Let's call it quits for today.
[157:36.05]Dismissed.
[157:38.21]We go to business now?
[157:45.36]He got away again.
[157:47.24]Let's go home.
[157:47.82]Got to call Trish.
[157:48.58]Got to call Trish.
[157:50.88]Dale, what are you doing after this?
[157:51.98]Going home.
[157:56.64]See you tomorrow.
[158:02.96]The future gamer chair.
[158:13.90]Ring.
[158:16.30]Who could be calling me this early in the morning?
[158:22.97]Yeah, it's me, Harry.
[158:23.87]You awake?
[158:25.65]Uh, Harry, yeah, morning.
[158:26.99]I'm up.
[158:27.27]What's going on?
[158:29.25]Showtime, partner.
[158:30.31]Seems like there's a robo-fight at the Diamond Chinese restaurant.
[158:35.87]Ernest wants us there as soon as possible.
[158:38.77]There, you mean at the office?
[158:40.93]No, he wants us to go straight to Diamond.
[158:44.35]That thing at Bogie's yesterday has been bugging him, so he said he'd meet up with us there.
[158:49.59]Okay, got it.
[158:50.35]Diamond, right?
[158:51.81]Coolio.
[158:52.59]See you there.
[158:53.01]Alright, so every ResidentSleeper I see, one cent goes into the ResidentSleeper bank.
[159:06.35]You know that's- you get that, you know that, right?
[159:08.84]Holy shit.
[159:15.66]Vertical gun.
[159:18.36]Spider pod.
[159:25.47]bankrupt him.
[159:26.29]No, no, I'm talking about you guys.
[159:29.58]I'm talking about you.
[159:31.28]Not me.
[159:31.64]Yeah, you scared me.
[159:37.82]What happened?
[159:38.30]You woke up on your own.
[159:39.34]No, no, no, no.
[159:41.28]Harry called me.
[159:41.85]I've got work to do.
[159:43.39]Oh, and I'm so proud of you, having woken up yourself at once.
[159:46.61]Oh, yeah, right.
[159:47.63]Look, I have to go.
[159:48.27]I have to get to the Davin Charity's restaurant.
[159:50.80]Oh, Diamond, that place is the best.
[159:52.70]The owner's a great chef.
[159:53.58]His name is Dandotan.
[159:54.56]Tell him he's so nice.
[159:55.80]He can make anything.
[159:56.40]Ramen, gyoza, fried rice, sour pork, egg, mayonnaise, pizza.
[159:59.69]Oh, it sounds delicious.
[160:00.69]I'm making myself a burger.
[160:02.43]So, where's Diamond?
[160:04.03]You don't know?
[160:04.51]Just go north, in the Middle East.
[160:10.43]Sorry, I had to times-do that on the YouTube video.
[160:16.54]Diamond.
[160:18.24]It's time for a fight.
[160:26.53]What happened here?
[160:28.14]Body on the ground.
[160:32.00]How could this have happened?
[160:32.78]It's terrible.
[160:35.96]Hey Dale, you're here.
[160:36.90]We were too late, it seems.
[160:37.88]Poor guy, he was dead before we came here.
[160:39.24]Looks like mental shock must have killed him.
[160:44.35]You could take real physical damage in a robo-battle.
[160:46.93]If you die in the game, you die in real life.
[160:49.51]It takes a tremendous amount of stress to actually kill someone.
[160:53.99]I go to all the trouble of coming here in person and this is what I get.
[161:00.57]How many layers down was he in the dream?
[161:03.14]Right?
[161:12.52]I'm kidding.
[161:12.96]It was a joke.
[161:13.72]It was a joke.
[161:14.50]It was made.
[161:15.02]It was deliberate farming.
[161:17.60]If it's a deliberate farm, it's not a -2.
[161:19.74]It's an equals two.
[161:22.43]Equals to if it's a deliberate farm.
[161:24.37]Don't you get that?
[161:32.70]Cops are too busy to solve a murder.
[161:34.28]Apparently.
[161:35.76]It was already too late when we arrived.
[161:40.10]We're late.
[161:40.48]Things have gotten pretty bad here.
[161:41.56]Do we have his cube?
[161:46.01]Harry?
[161:47.15]What are you doing here?
[161:48.95]We got a call, but it came too late.
[161:50.23]Whatever happened, it was over before we got here.
[161:52.83]Bounty hunters.
[161:53.77]Bah!
[161:54.95]We got it from here.
[161:56.41]So why don't you all beat it?
[161:58.36]Say what?
[162:00.06]We've got a job to do and you bounty hunters aren't a part of it.
[162:04.04]Oh, is that so?
[162:05.28]Sure, you show up for these cases, but for the small ones you don't even bother.
[162:09.55]That's easy for you to say.
[162:11.71]You bounty hunters are free to pick your missions, but we police have far more responsibility.
[162:17.40]Where's the law that regulates average folks needed, huh?
[162:22.53]Can't be bothered, is that it?
[162:25.07]You're not looking after the people who need you.
[162:28.29]Why do I even waste my time on a waster like you?
[162:31.39]You're nothing like your sister.
[162:33.49]You!
[162:34.71]Leave it, Harry.
[162:35.79]It's out of our hands now.
[162:38.24]Harry, let's go.
[162:39.64]Come on, Gale.
[162:42.66]Wait, you got a minute?
[162:44.69]Roy, according to the witness, the victim was fighting some sort of autonomous robo.
[162:52.45]What did you say?
[162:53.07]And when it killed the victim, it fled the scene.
[163:00.59]Sounds like trouble.
[163:03.33]You really don't have a clue what's going on, do you?
[163:06.30]An autonomous robo moves itself without having any commander dive into it.
[163:10.24]They were designed for manual and repetitive labor that I've never heard of where that one fights.
[163:15.47]Oh.
[163:17.97]Which is why I have to ask you for a favor, Marcia.
[163:20.65]I need your help.
[163:23.11]What?
[163:23.41]Me?
[163:24.71]You know what I'm going to ask you?
[163:25.99]I need to do a half dive and read the victim's last thoughts.
[163:32.76]Skip the dialog.
[163:33.72]Okay.
[163:38.54]You call that asking a respected fellow law enforcement for help?
[163:41.08]Say it like you mean it.
[163:42.16]What do you mean no?
[163:46.72]Thank God.
[163:47.28]No, fuck you.
[163:48.10]What?
[163:48.28]It was one guy?
[163:49.38]More than one.
[163:50.76]What?
[163:52.02]Shut it, Harry.
[163:52.63]Marcia, business is business.
[163:55.19]If you think you can take it, then give the cops a hand.
[163:58.41]I don't know, Ernest.
[164:00.31]I haven't done a half-dive in so long, I'm not even sure I still can.
[164:02.85]I'm not sure I'm following this, but I don't think Marcia can help out here.
[164:10.06]We need her to help, though.
[164:10.92]There's no one else we can turn to.
[164:13.50]See, we understand if you can't do it.
[164:15.30]We won't blame you if you fail.
[164:16.50]Please help us.
[164:17.20]What a bad audition this is for a TV show that I want to be on.
[164:23.13]Imagine coming in.
[164:25.69]You have an audition for one character.
[164:28.15]And you step in.
[164:28.93]You have these big sunglasses on.
[164:30.73]You're like, no, no, no.
[164:32.29]You don't have to read for me.
[164:33.29]You don't have to get anybody to read.
[164:34.68]I'm going to do all of them.
[164:38.02]Then you do this.
[164:41.02]You, is this impressive to an audition or is this like, ah, this guy's kind of fucking weird.
[164:45.11]I don't know if I want this guy in here.
[164:46.35]Alright, let me concentrate.
[164:52.29]What's a half dive?
[164:53.17]Uh, I know, they just told me what a half dive is.
[164:56.81]It's when they go in and they can pull data out.
[164:58.33]What are they going to do?
[165:01.78]Just watch.
[165:02.60]It's Marcia's special power.
[165:04.16]Lord, I told you a while back, Marcia's had this special power since she was young.
[165:09.79]Garcia can dive into a robo that's already been registered by eye contact.
[165:14.81]Doesn't mean she can control a pre-registered robo, though.
[165:18.13]However, she's able to read the commander's remaining cognition.
[165:22.65]So whatever the commander saw through his robo's eyes, she sees.
[165:25.57]She can even read that guy's last thoughts, gruesome.
[165:31.58]Become an unboxing YouTuber?
[165:33.26]No.
[165:36.28]No.
[165:38.70]Alright, she's gonna half-dive.
[165:39.72]Arrrgh!
[165:44.58]Orseo, what's wrong?
[165:45.41]What happened?
[165:45.97]Okay, I'll calm down.
[165:47.49]I'll explain later.
[165:48.31]How'd it go?
[165:49.83]What did you find?
[165:53.21]It just cuts to, like, he's at the drive-thru.
[165:55.49]It's weird, boring shit.
[165:57.19]He's ordering, like, a number two or something.
[165:59.66]And then he just comes in here and lies on the ground and dies.
[166:01.66]He wasn't fighting a custom robo!
[166:08.20]What do you mean?
[166:08.68]It didn't look like a robot.
[166:10.44]I've never seen anything like it.
[166:11.62]It was like a living thing.
[166:14.86]That's ridiculous.
[166:15.56]No living thing can enter a holo-zam.
[166:18.07]You're right.
[166:18.41]It's just not possible.
[166:20.21]But everything about it is different.
[166:21.35]It doesn't move like a robot.
[166:22.43]It doesn't even look like one.
[166:26.11]You see what it was?
[166:27.73]Only vaguely, it's just... I've heard enough.
[166:29.67]There's no way that could happen.
[166:31.73]Shh!
[166:32.29]Shut up, Roy!
[166:33.85]Marcia, what?
[166:34.55]Just what?
[166:36.41]I've never felt such overwhelming power.
[166:45.83]Come with us to HQ.
[166:46.77]We'll want to make a composite sketch of the robo you saw.
[166:50.44]Hey, whoa there.
[166:53.12]Look at her.
[166:53.52]Marcy is in bad shape.
[166:54.62]The stress of the half dive is getting to her.
[166:58.04]I see what she has to go through every time she does this.
[167:01.38]We're sorry about that, but as a citizen she must comply with any and all police squad orders.
[167:07.07]Unlimited power.
[167:08.19]As if.
[167:09.27]Look at you barking like a dog.
[167:10.41]Still taking orders from my own sister, loser.
[167:15.37]Harry, you're out of line.
[167:27.46]Just don't over exert.
[167:28.18]We got your back.
[167:28.64]Bye.
[167:28.76]Hey Harry, let's go.
[167:57.54]This is a visual novel?
[167:58.88]People happy.
[168:10.11]It kind of is, yeah.
[168:11.93]But, okay, it's a visual novel with really fun shit sprinkled sometimes in the game.
[168:18.25]It still has my attention.
[168:24.61]It's taking Marcia so long.
[168:25.93]I wonder if she's okay.
[168:28.41]Marcia will be fine.
[168:29.19]She's got a strong will.
[168:30.29]She's not like you.
[168:31.13]That's not nice.
[168:34.61]But how come Marcia was so willing to help those cops?
[168:36.65]I mean, she hardly argued at all.
[168:37.91]Hey Harry, what's so special about a half dive?
[168:41.38]Why can't anyone else do it?
[168:42.34]I don't know.
[168:44.88]It's a rare talent.
[168:46.14]I've never met anyone who can do it.
[168:48.74]Really?
[168:49.02]But there might be others.
[168:49.94]I've never even heard about a half dive before now.
[168:53.59]Well, according to my system, Marcy is the only commander.
[168:56.41]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[168:57.52]You can do a half-time.
[168:58.70]Whoa, that's insane.
[169:00.50]Well, she's something alright, but it doesn't sound all that great.
[169:03.16]Her power makes her extremely sensitive.
[169:04.74]Emotionally speaking, I mean.
[169:07.10]Oh, so, for example, you ever have times when there's something on your mind that you get worried?
[169:14.80]Well, in Marcia's case, take those worries and multiply them by a hundred.
[169:21.48]She gets so stressed out, she just freezes.
[169:26.04]That's pretty sensitive.
[169:32.72]Uh, yeah, she's been like that since she was a child, okay?
[169:36.52]That's why she seems so distant.
[169:37.90]She needs the distance to keep from getting hurt by people.
[169:41.62]See, it's like this.
[169:43.00]Marcia's big brother always used to protect her.
[169:45.82]It's rough being that sensitive and losing both your parents and your brother.
[169:49.22]Yeah, she really sort of hit rock bottom.
[169:50.78]It took a lot of work for Marcia to get to where she is now.
[169:54.47]Hey, that's enough out of you.
[169:56.41]If I even catch you guys treating her differently because of this, I'll whoop you both good.
[170:02.23]It's the phone.
[170:02.69]Maybe it's Marcia.
[170:04.95]How sensitive is she?
[170:05.83]I don't know.
[170:08.29]Very?
[170:08.71]I think she's pretty sensitive.
[170:13.13]Steelheart, you squeal.
[170:15.07]You squeal, we'll deal.
[170:16.04]This is Ernest.
[170:19.08]Oh, bogey.
[170:19.64]Sorry about yesterday.
[170:21.32]I knew he was a wanted man.
[170:22.67]I forgot my robo.
[170:23.79]That's why I couldn't catch him on the spot.
[170:26.48]What?
[170:26.82]Oh, I get it.
[170:27.66]You gave Dark Blue the job yesterday, so now you're handing one down to us today.
[170:31.92]Thank you.
[170:33.36]You're absolutely right.
[170:34.25]I'm a very loyal customer.
[170:35.31]Your cafe has great atmosphere.
[170:37.63]Oh, you're starting a poetry slam night?
[170:40.21]What makes you think that I write poetry?
[170:43.43]You saw that?
[170:44.79]Well, I'll send the boys over right now.
[170:51.82]Alright, we've got work.
[170:52.78]Get over to Bogey's, pronto.
[170:55.29]This is not a tutorial.
[170:56.33]It's been three hours.
[170:58.01]Seems like there's some guy making a killing on battle wagers.
[171:02.01]Bogey said the guy's incredibly strong and he's going to put Bogey out of business if this keeps up.
[171:05.13]Oh, you're not coming, Ernest?
[171:10.18]I don't think so.
[171:10.64]I feel like a bad luck right now.
[171:13.48]I got some light filing to do.
[171:15.88]Yeah, sure.
[171:16.54]Hurry up.
[171:20.16]Go, go, go.
[171:20.62]Go.
[171:22.22]Go.
[171:32.05]Ogie's Cafe.
[171:32.79]Here it is.
[171:33.15]Time for a fight.
[171:38.71]Thanks for the call.
[171:39.63]At your service.
[171:42.31]Well, hello.
[171:47.71]I've been waiting for you, Harry.
[171:49.01]And you too, Dale.
[171:50.67]Oh, great.
[171:51.11]Not you.
[171:51.51]Here you go.
[171:52.11]Let's fight.
[171:54.33]I'll give you the TL;DR.
[171:56.61]Bad guy versus good guy.
[171:57.97]Trying to teach.
[172:00.07]Why is his hands up?
[172:03.97]We would have resolved the situation right away, but Bogey insisted that we gave you Steelheart's fellow a fair shot.
[172:09.41]And fair's fair, of course.
[172:10.45]We're waiting until you screw up.
[172:11.48]Fair's fair, Bogey called us, not you.
[172:13.40]This is our job.
[172:14.12]Oh, please, Harry.
[172:14.88]Are you even listening?
[172:15.52]We're mercenaries.
[172:16.22]The job goes to the fastest team.
[172:18.60]But we're a generous group.
[172:19.98]We dark blue mercenaries.
[172:21.78]We'll fight.
[172:22.10]How about two on two?
[172:42.16]Did you hear all those breaths?
[172:44.86]I want to see the new things we got.
[172:47.40]Vertical.
[172:48.36]This is so cool.
[172:49.34]There's 13 pages of guns.
[172:51.75]But unfortunately, there's 13 pages of dialog as well.
[172:55.53]Between every single scene.
[172:56.87]I want to try vertical.
[173:01.73]Vertical.
[173:06.76]Keep standard, I like the standard.
[173:09.82]I got a new one of these too, didn't I?
[173:12.94]Spider.
[173:14.12]Remains in place when deployed, and homes in on a target when it approaches.
[173:17.96]Try it.
[173:19.02]Where's the vertical?
[173:21.28]Two rounds straight.
[173:24.12]And two more vertical.
[173:27.00]Ah, okay.
[173:27.22]You can clear walls?
[173:30.18]The vertical ones clear walls.
[173:31.24]Alright, that's awesome.
[173:33.67]Yeah, let's try this.
[173:35.03]It looks pretty cool.
[173:35.87]Alright, let's do it.
[174:03.14]Six seconds, what?!
[174:05.26]I've been mashing!
[174:13.90]Get over there, get over there.
[174:14.72]Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.
[174:19.24]Wait, the spider.
[174:21.56]The spider is weird.
[174:26.70]Do a live commentary of pre-recording.
[174:28.30]I'm almost dead!
[174:30.18]How am I almost dead?
[174:30.96]No, that's weird.
[174:41.75]Get out of the tutorial.
[174:42.85]I'm trying!
[174:47.80]With like... With like... Eight-tenths of the game's dialog, there's not much I can do.
[174:52.58]Where's my partner?
[174:59.23]What is he doing over there?
[175:01.31]Oh wait, I'm gonna lose.
[175:18.97]I think we were supposed to lose.
[175:26.06]It's scripted.
[175:27.76]It's scripted.
[175:33.70]Let me tell you a little bit about two-on-two.
[175:35.54]In a two-on-two battle, your partner's gunshots and charges won't hurt you.
[175:39.36]Still take damage if you get... Yeah.
[175:42.23]I got it.
[175:42.53]Will we get a second chance?
[175:44.77]Full throttle.
[175:45.49]Let's go.
[175:46.01]Okay.
[175:49.21]Sorry, he's new.
[175:50.07]Alright, I want to go back to what I was using before.
[175:53.65]Get him an IP.
[176:03.44]Get the spider off.
[176:04.88]I don't like it that much.
[176:05.54]Cockroach is the way to go.
[176:06.60]Better get rid of it.
[176:07.86]Long thrust.
[176:09.78]That's my guy right here.
[176:12.62]Wait, I have a new robot.
[176:17.63]I'm sorry, there's so much talking in this game that I forgot that, like, I forgot some stuff that I actually unlocked.
[176:23.10]The you unlocked this thing is one sentence squished in between, like, 300 sentences.
[176:29.58]Anything red?
[176:37.43]Red.
[176:44.51]I'm gonna keep this one.
[176:46.36]Yeah.
[176:47.10]Let's try him.
[177:01.59]Bam.
[177:05.95]What the fuck?
[177:06.77]Why am I so slow?
[177:19.02]Get those cockroaches out.
[177:25.84]Cockroaches, cockroaches, cockroaches!
[177:29.53]We gotta bully this guy back here.
[177:37.83]Bully, bully, bully, bully.
[177:42.31]Good.
[177:42.47]Alright, this guy's toast.
[177:48.14]Roach is the best, for sure.
[177:52.30]Knock him down.
[177:52.92]I'll get him with this.
[177:53.44]Knock him down.
[177:55.50]Knock him down.
[177:55.98]Get a knockdown.
[178:05.75]Cockroaches are by far the best item in the game.
[178:07.41]Let's get back to the story already.
[178:21.36]I got two more pods.
[178:24.65]Oh, exhilarating.
[178:25.31]How best to measure one's skill than to permit him to have victory.
[178:28.31]Did you learn something?
[178:29.73]I certainly hope you did.
[178:30.65]Why don't we talk about my story?
[178:34.84]You see, when I was a young boy, my father left me and my mother left too.
[178:40.30]And then I decided I was go- Thank God.
[178:49.53]Can I go off script?
[178:50.57]No, I'm staying on script, but quick.
[178:54.84]We beat him.
[178:55.34]Can't even own up to it.
[178:56.18]Anyway, that was a nice little waste of our time.
[178:58.04]Now we'd better get back to work.
[178:59.10]Okay, Bogey, where can we find this guy you're after?
[179:03.00]How's that door?
[179:05.66]Oh.
[179:07.65]That's a false wall.
[179:08.91]There's a door hidden there.
[179:10.55]We hold robo battles in the back room.
[179:12.81]This guy's been winning every match and I'm losing money.
[179:19.65]Stop pretending to read.
[179:20.91]Don't read.
[179:21.37]Stop pretending.
[179:22.09]Okay.
[179:26.22]Well, I mean, what is illegal anyway?
[179:28.48]I mean, it's such a vague term, you know?
[179:31.30]I get it.
[179:31.52]That's why you called us instead of the cops.
[179:32.86]You didn't want to get busted.
[179:35.14]It is 3D Movie Maker.
[179:36.02]This is the same exact restaurant.
[179:39.90]In fact, it's like the same actor behind the counter.
[179:42.41]This is the same shot.
[179:45.96]Maybe when you're older, you'll understand.
[179:48.37]Listen, don't tell anyone, okay?
[179:52.79]Harry, alright, what's in it for me?
[179:54.13]I mean, I can be quiet about it, or I can be real noisy.
[179:59.57]Hey, hey, don't be that way.
[180:00.27]You'll get paid well if you pull this off.
[180:01.83]Alright, keep your mouth shut, Dale.
[180:04.06]Let's go.
[180:05.12]I would appreciate your discretion.
[180:16.30]Sephiroth?
[180:18.70]We should chat up the crowd for some info before we sign up.
[180:27.67]Left flank bomb.
[180:28.53]What else did I get?
[180:30.35]Tank pod F. Pretty cool.
[180:35.33]Let's chat up the crowd.
[180:38.57]Mentoring the next tournament.
[180:40.21]I'll probably bump into one of you, depending on how they mix up the entries.
[180:44.59]Pardon me, but are you the one who's been winning all the matches?
[180:48.13]You got the wrong person, buddy.
[180:49.83]You want to talk to Shiner.
[180:51.93]He's in the waiting room right now with the other combatants.
[180:55.77]Okay, I wonder who he is.
[180:56.61]Okay, it probably has to be you.
[180:59.77]No, it could be you.
[181:00.81]It's probably you.
[181:01.89]One of you two back here?
[181:02.80]No, it can't be you.
[181:04.32]Can't be the only person with an actual video game model that was made.
[181:08.30]You're not the guy.
[181:11.95]And I have the Phantom of the Opera thing in front of my face.
[181:16.53]No, that's not him.
[181:19.59]I keep betting on the underdog, but Shiner keeps beating them.
[181:22.06]I'll never break even now.
[181:26.22]The guy over there hasn't placed one bet.
[181:27.80]He's just been sitting there watching the battles.
[181:30.22]What's he even doing here?
[181:33.18]Wait, is this not the guy?
[181:36.63]Shiner's been winning all the matches, so it's no fun to bet.
[181:39.55]That's why it's slow today.
[181:46.76]You might as well just write M-U-A-H.
[181:50.00]M-U-A-M-U-A-H-A-H-A-H-A.
[181:54.44]At this point.
[181:59.17]Today just ain't my day.
[182:00.49]I'll barely break even if I bet on Shiner.
[182:03.19]He's the odds-on favorite, but nobody's going to beat Shiner, so there's no point in betting on anybody else.
[182:13.14]Is this Shiner?
[182:16.33]You must be Harry and Dale.
[182:18.37]Bogie told me you'd be coming.
[182:20.39]Are you ready to fight?
[182:21.21]No, not yet.
[182:23.11]You need some time to talk to all the creeps around here.
[182:25.69]I understand.
[182:26.78]I'll be ready when you are ready.
[182:29.78]I talked to everybody already.
[182:32.88]Day by day.
[182:37.06]Sorry, guys, but I'm going to take Shiner down and claim the prize.
[182:43.09]Who did I not talk to?
[182:49.29]If you enter the battle tournament, you can win big.
[182:52.93]You can get badly beat, though.
[182:58.52]Day in, play day.
[183:01.52]Shiner's been winning all the games.
[183:02.84]Where is he?
[183:11.54]You must be Harry.
[183:13.18]I'm hosting a battle tournament with 16 commanders.
[183:16.67]I was just making the entry list for the next tournament.
[183:18.43]16?
[183:19.51]I hope we get to play.
[183:21.77]I'm determining your entry position now.
[183:23.39]Hold on a moment.
[183:28.07]Beep.
[183:30.04]16.
[183:31.62]All the way at the back of the Mario Kart line.
[183:33.72]Right?
[183:34.12]Uh-huh.
[183:35.06]Dale is number 9.
[183:40.85]Which one's been winning all the matches?
[183:43.01]Well, that would be Shiner, entry number one.
[183:44.55]He's number one, I'm number sixteen.
[183:48.79]And Dale is number nine.
[183:50.85]Gang, according to this, we won't get a chance to face him until the finals.
[183:55.45]And that means that Dale and I have to fight each other in the semi-finals?
[183:59.43]What?
[183:59.73]Season two of every anime ever?
[184:02.27]Season fucking the entire season is this whole thing?
[184:05.91]You can skip season two of every anime that's ever existed?
[184:09.42]What?
[184:11.96]Can't we change?
[184:17.68]Sorry, everything's done by computers.
[184:19.00]It's totally random.
[184:19.88]I can't change your number for you.
[184:21.16]If I start messing around with the numbers, the guests will think I'm fixing the matches.
[184:29.27]But I thought Bogey set this up for us.
[184:31.07]Aw, man.
[184:31.61]Well, I guess we'll just have to win your tournament.
[184:34.39]Please wait here.
[184:34.85]I'll call you when it's your turn.
[184:36.37]Please call me when it's my turn.
[184:48.73]Is it my turn?
[184:50.86]We can't leave.
[184:51.50]Uh, excuse me.
[184:55.08]Is it my turn yet?
[184:57.34]Are you ready to go?
[184:58.04]Make sure you check the parts generator.
[184:59.66]You said you were going to call me.
[185:07.47]First battle will be Dale versus Polly.
[185:12.06]That's right, it's me, Paulie.
[185:13.72]Your original character.
[185:16.79]You thought you could say, make Paul and then just delete him?
[185:19.81]No.
[185:21.39]I exist.
[185:25.29]Go for it, Dil.
[185:25.83]Don't worry, I've got tons of advice to get you through this.
[185:34.00]Tons of advice.
[185:34.76]That's not fair.
[185:35.36]This should be disqualified.
[185:36.32]I win by default.
[185:38.28]Hey, chill.
[185:38.66]I'm not fighting.
[185:39.24]I'm just watching.
[185:40.82]Hang on, aren't you a cop?
[185:43.54]What's an upright member of the police squad like yourself doing in a place like this?
[185:49.54]Shh, not so loud.
[185:50.34]How could you tell?
[185:50.92]You know he's wearing his uniform.
[185:55.40]Wait a minute.
[185:56.00]You're those guys who busted the lab burglary.
[185:59.61]You must have recognized my distinctive features.
[186:04.75]More like your distinctive uniform.
[186:06.93]Cops all look the same to me.
[186:09.73]So wait, that means that you're one of those guys the burglars beat up.
[186:14.11]And you're one of those guys who shuts up.
[186:17.11]Insurance didn't cover any of my bills, so I'm trying to make some scratch on the side, okay?
[186:23.41]Listen, guys, I'm sure you've got lots to catch up on, but we're trying to hold a tournament here.
[186:28.97]I'm going to do better this time.
[186:30.01]This time I'm in it for the money.
[186:32.24]Yeah, whatever you're saying.
[186:34.46]Okay, my advice for you is to beat this guy up, but good.
[186:40.69]Enough dialog.
[186:41.97]I'm trying.
[186:42.67]This guy's using a Strike Vanisher model.
[186:45.55]Let me explain.
[186:47.07]Like the Shining Fighter, the Strike Vanisher's model, the abilities are well balanced.
[186:52.22]But the biggest difference is that it has a stealth function.
[186:55.50]Stealth function?
[186:56.88]If you do an air dash, this function will make your robot disappear, dodging incoming gunfire.
[187:03.51]Compared to a Shining Fighter model, it moves slowly.
[187:10.33]I'm like yawning now.
[187:11.13]You guys made me yawn because you said yawn.
[187:17.49]Wouldn't that be funny?
[187:18.57]If you're going to use a strike banisher, take advantage of its stealth ability to dodge.
[187:22.60]Got it?
[187:22.92]No, why?
[187:29.64]And one more thing.
[187:30.96]There's a holozeum called a diamond cell that the police squad use.
[187:35.18]There's a magma zone in that holozeum, so be careful.
[187:38.79]Oh, yeah.
[187:39.39]It's that red stuff.
[187:40.61]Don't step in it.
[187:42.03]How's that irony, though?
[187:43.11]You're not a crook, but you're fighting a cop.
[187:44.87]Comedy.
[187:47.63]Harry, can I play the game now?
[187:50.13]Oh, yes.
[187:50.53]Sorry.
[187:50.91]Sorry.
[187:51.25]Sorry.
[187:51.51]Yes.
[187:51.87]Yes.
[187:55.21]The Gatling gun?
[187:55.83]Let's check it out.
[188:00.29]I like the ape.
[188:03.91]So much stuff.
[188:05.88]I wish I would just be able to play and unlock.
[188:07.42]Alright, bang to F. Stops in front of its target.
[188:12.06]Can deploy two at one time.
[188:13.20]Can I get another one?
[188:18.09]I mean, you kind of have to try everything once, right?
[188:19.63]I did vertical.
[188:25.77]I didn't like it.
[188:29.68]Let's try this.
[188:38.34]Alright, don't stand in the lava.
[188:39.22]Mash.
[189:03.48]What the fuck was that?
[189:04.14]He just lagged.
[189:17.94]Oh, that's the stealth feature.
[189:19.30]Okay.
[189:20.44]It's a shitty connection.
[189:26.48]I don't even know what that does.
[189:30.90]Don't lose.
[189:31.28]Don't lose in the tournament.
[189:37.95]Play smart.
[189:49.93]Shit!
[189:52.95]You're gonna lose in the first round?
[189:54.03]I'm not gonna lose in the first round.
[190:00.95]If I lose in this round, I will gift 25,000 subs.
[190:14.88]I'm good.
[190:15.16]Don't have to do that.
[190:18.10]Access to the Javelin.
[190:26.24]Why couldn't I have drawn an easier first match?
[190:28.06]So much for paying my bills.
[190:30.68]Skills like those, how do you ever get to be a cop?
[190:35.20]That's sad, isn't it?
[190:36.52]Do I shake hand this guy $100?
[190:39.30]Right?
[190:39.42]I feel bad.
[190:45.49]Alright, next fight.
[190:49.35]That's a new, uh, that's a new Robo-type.
[191:01.70]Javelin.
[191:03.04]Strike Vanisher model.
[191:03.98]Oh, this is one of the stealth ones.
[191:05.18]I'll try it.
[191:05.58]I don't like the criminal one.
[191:11.86]Alright, Javelin and, uh, Yellow.
[191:18.55]Hmm.
[191:19.95]I'll try to get this to work.
[191:23.43]What do I do with my channel points?
[191:26.17]You just hold on to them forever.
[191:28.93]Pretty much that's going to happen.
[191:32.21]Cockroach.
[191:43.30]Holy shit, I can do that.
[191:46.92]Alright, let's go.
[191:48.24]Round two.
[191:50.40]No, not this shit.
[191:51.50]Not this, just don't do this.
[191:52.98]This is like, the only thing you guys use channel points for is the one thing that I haven't disabled.
[191:57.97]And that's the purple text that takes over.
[192:00.01]It's the only thing that you can do besides the emote changes.
[192:02.65]And it's 1,200.
[192:03.37]And I know at least 2,000 to 3,000 of you have like 20 million channel points.
[192:08.87]So this could go on forever.
[192:10.63]You could, some of you guys, this is like a nickel to a lot of you guys.
[192:18.39]Alright, I won my first match too.
[192:19.95]Shiner won his match.
[192:21.59]Are we going up against his dad again?
[192:22.81]Let's have a clean fight.
[192:26.73]Isn't that the one guy who got in a fight with his wife?
[192:29.33]Yes, it is.
[192:31.43]What are you doing in this place?
[192:33.69]Well, it's like this.
[192:34.52]My wife handles all our money and I don't get much allowance.
[192:37.12]So I figured this would be a good way to make some extra money.
[192:40.72]You want allowance?
[192:44.35]You better believe it.
[192:45.01]By the way, I have a favor to ask.
[192:46.55]Could you take it easy on me, you know, so I could win?
[192:50.31]No.
[192:51.49]I want to win.
[192:53.61]Highlight my message.
[192:58.11]I have to delete channel points.
[193:02.17]Think where you're going to fire when you use that pod.
[193:04.23]You can do all kinds of things with the pod.
[193:06.05]Pod, pod, pod, pod, pod, pod.
[193:07.28]Yeah.
[193:07.58]Uh-huh.
[193:10.24]Thank you, Dale.
[193:12.31]Wake up, I'll say it again.
[193:13.33]Oh, no.
[193:17.13]We just made him do it again.
[193:18.35]Remember, you lost the chat hours ago.
[193:23.06]Did I?
[193:29.44]Did I lose the chat hours ago?
[193:30.86]I feel like I didn't.
[193:32.22]I feel like we've been talking.
[193:35.74]We've been having a conversation.
[193:37.36]We've been hanging out.
[193:42.28]That's a cool type.
[193:42.90]Was it a super type?
[193:43.65]That's a Dr. Robotnik type.
[193:45.57]I want that one.
[193:51.99]Let's try the javelin.
[193:59.82]Beanbag Sonic Robo.
[194:01.46]Yeah.
[194:01.68]This is a cool area too.
[194:03.98]Alright, why am I not being able to get this draw here?
[194:07.24]Alright, go.
[194:10.10]Here we go.
[194:14.14]Damn, this thing actually works pretty well when it's a slow.
[194:16.50]Holy shit, this is awesome.
[194:26.17]Vertical with this guy.
[194:27.69]What's his move do?
[194:45.78]Roaches, get him!
[194:51.28]Speaking of Rebirth... Hey, hey, what?
[194:53.94]Speaking of Rebirth... Wasn't there a new Binding of Isaac thing that was supposed to come out like two years ago?
[194:59.16]What happened to that?
[195:03.67]Is that out?
[195:11.87]Go get him, Roaches, go!
[195:16.57]Yeah, like Redemption or something, or Repentance or something, whatever it's called.
[195:28.88]Damn, come on.
[195:29.34]I've got to get in closer to drop these broaches on him.
[195:35.54]There we go.
[195:46.53]Adam Roaches.
[195:55.77]You can do that three times.
[195:57.31]Holy shit.
[195:58.67]This character is really good.
[196:08.40]I need to play X-Men Origins.
[196:11.04]What do you mean watch the movie on stream?
[196:12.44]Because I can't do that.
[196:16.59]Left five-way gunner.
[196:24.06]I'll never afford that lovely toupee now.
[196:26.04]What was the name of that robo game that I played?
[196:32.28]Wait, what did you say?
[196:33.68]What was the name of that robo game that Jerm played a while ago that was almost like this?
[196:37.64]It was called Gachuforce.
[196:41.06]And it is incredible.
[196:43.94]That is a fantastic video game.
[196:45.68]I love every second of it.
[196:52.49]Semi-finals are going.
[196:53.47]Here we go.
[196:58.94]This is worse than that.
[197:00.96]Are you implying that Gacha Force is not a good game?
[197:02.88]Because if you are, then that is a permaban on this channel.
[197:06.52]An aha permaban.
[197:07.56]It's going to be like a minute.
[197:08.68]No, no, no, no.
[197:09.22]Like you are removed from the... You are removed forever.
[197:13.84]I will make sure that you are banned permanently and you don't get to chat ever again.
[197:16.72]Like, oh yeah, that's wicked funny, like I'm gonna ban you for like a minute.
[197:21.48]No, no, no.
[197:22.30]Absolutely not.
[197:23.24]You said Gotcha Force sucks?
[197:25.28]Be careful!
[197:25.80]Playing with fire.
[197:34.23]Everyone's gonna be banned.
[197:38.95]The higher you jump, the more vulnerable you become.
[197:40.90]Same goes for an air dash.
[197:44.93]Me versus you.
[197:52.06]I didn't watch that stream with a happy face.
[197:56.58]Edit your comment and make that a sad face.
[197:59.93]Or... You know what that is.
[198:05.01]I'm gonna keep this.
[198:05.53]I like this.
[198:05.87]Wait, what was the other thing I got?
[198:13.75]Fires five rounds that spread to the left side.
[198:16.09]The rounds turn in the opposite direction when fired from the air.
[198:19.49]I'll try it.
[198:29.19]Give me mod privilege and I'll edit it.
[198:31.47]Yeah, I'll give you mod, dude.
[198:34.91]Fucking hell freezes over.
[198:42.09]I like this one.
[198:43.45]Holy shit, this one's perfect.
[198:45.11]This is the spreader from Contra 3.
[198:49.45]Most satisfying weapon in any video game is the spreader from Contra 3, and it's in this game.
[199:08.28]Get him, roaches, get him!
[199:13.75]It's got roaches too.
[199:14.37]It's got good spread, but it doesn't do very much damage.
[199:26.39]Did I get a hit?
[199:39.76]Fuck.
[199:39.92]I have to be on that stupid thing.
[199:48.35]Earn, get him!
[199:48.75]Did I just hit myself with my own bomb?
[199:56.90]Shit!
[199:57.54]Oh no, he's just styling on me now.
[200:18.88]Is that health?
[200:21.30]I lost.
[200:22.68]Lost to Harry.
[200:23.59]Pepe LOL.
[200:29.39]It's a new guy.
[200:30.25]I haven't played with him.
[200:34.39]Do I lose the tournament?
[200:40.38]You're still a novice, so I'll give you just a bit more advice.
[200:42.66]The higher you jump... Wait, is he going to give me another chance?
[200:47.57]So I can't lose the tournament.
[200:49.23]Let's go at it for real this time.
[200:50.81]Yeah, the game is save scumming for me.
[201:00.63]Alright, I know his little bullshit.
[201:02.17]Watch this.
[201:04.73]Go back to the ape.
[201:06.93]Green Hulk ape.
[201:09.73]Go back to vertical.
[201:10.84]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[201:13.72]No, no, no, no, yeah.
[201:17.73]like H. Ockroach is alright, but I think I want speed D for this.
[201:31.16]Hey guys.
[201:33.16]He's pretending to know the strategy of the game.
[201:35.31]Did you hear the confidence in his voice?
[201:48.60]That was my mistake, not using this.
[202:01.89]Why did mine hit the wall and his went over the wall?
[202:09.90]Get him, speed!
[202:20.99]Close.
[202:21.35]I didn't say shbe.
[202:41.74]Where's the juggle there?
[202:48.16]Pirate!
[203:03.67]Eat that tree.
[203:04.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[203:08.93]Heard that one before.
[203:10.01]I win.
[203:27.93]Monkey always wins.
[203:28.61]Caboose pod.
[203:33.10]Now we gotta fight the guy in the Phantom of the Opera mask.
[203:34.74]I didn't think you'd be so good.
[203:37.62]I've trained you well.
[203:41.06]I didn't feel like going full strength on you.
[203:43.00]Heh.
[203:44.46]You're our man.
[203:45.12]Make sure you don't screw up because this is an important job.
[203:47.32]Alright, is Shiner gonna let me win?
[203:50.16]If I lose?
[203:54.66]Boost pod.
[203:55.24]Time for the finals.
[204:07.18]Is that Shiner?
[204:15.00]It's time for the finals between Shiner and our newest star.
[204:18.08]I've never seen this guy before.
[204:19.34]Doesn't matter what you do.
[204:24.02]Everyone will bet on me.
[204:25.64]I'm the best.
[204:27.34]No one wants to throw away his money on an obvious loser.
[204:31.33]You know what?
[204:32.39]I don't care about all these losers make this place a profit.
[204:37.13]As long as I'm with Waluigi.
[204:41.38]That's not even close to Waluigi.
[204:45.62]Not even close.
[204:52.32]As long as I'm making money and the masses go weak at the knees when they see me, I'm happy.
[205:00.37]That's such a stretch.
[205:03.57]So tell me, are you jealous of my skill?
[205:06.81]Do you hate me?
[205:08.35]Hey, what do you say?
[205:10.18]Sorry, what was that?
[205:11.82]We were busy polishing our RoboCubes.
[205:13.96]What is wrong with this guy?
[205:16.42]Excuse me.
[205:17.36]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[205:19.16]It's a laugh.
[205:20.37]I'm the one who's going to eat him alive.
[205:22.77]I'll show you the power of Breaker, my lightning sky Robo.
[205:27.42]Lightning Sky?
[205:28.20]I don't know what that is.
[205:29.14]Can you explain to me what a Lightning- Lightning Sky model is the newest addition to the custom robot line.
[205:34.22]It can attack and change directions while doing an air dash.
[205:37.98]It can only air dash once, but it travels for a long time.
[205:40.82]It almost looks like it's flying.
[205:43.34]However, it moves really slowly on the ground.
[205:45.86]It's got a low defense, and that's its weakness.
[205:48.98]Got it?
[205:49.56]Thanks.
[205:51.80]There are 13 pages of this shit, and every one of them we're going to get an explanation.
[205:58.34]Alright, we got an ape.
[206:08.54]What do you got?
[206:09.06]A flame cannon?
[206:12.15]A straight G?
[206:13.87]A caboose X?
[206:16.73]This is like really cool looking actually.
[206:18.17]This is a really cool looking robo.
[206:20.95]I was a straight G. We straight ahead.
[206:25.87]Six rounds.
[206:29.27]I'm going to keep the ape.
[206:35.11]I want to check Caboose X. Caboose C. Huge attack and huge size?
[206:47.01]Why is it in the opposite direction of where you aim?
[206:50.84]That does a lot of damage.
[206:51.58]Let's try it.
[206:56.56]Where's the one that stays there for a while?
[206:58.14]Let's see.
[207:02.07]You have an IP, right?
[207:04.73]Yeah.
[207:05.26]I want you to have an IP.
[207:08.68]I'll keep Feather on.
[207:14.01]Change the color?
[207:14.63]Um... I think I can, but I like the green.
[207:30.44]How did you get first hit?
[207:32.20]Holy fuck, I just knocked him a million years in the future.
[207:36.80]It goes in the opposite direction, so I gotta run the other way and shoot it this way.
[207:54.32]Easier than ha-
