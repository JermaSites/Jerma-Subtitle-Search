[01:07.71]Good evening.
[01:09.39]Good evening.
[01:10.31]What was that intro?
[01:14.17]Let's just turn on the mic.
[01:15.21]There you go.
[01:16.39]Good evening.
[01:18.25]That was somebody trying so hard to pretend like they're not sick.
[01:22.86]Or pretend like they feel good, you know?
[01:25.72]You could tell I was sitting here, just amping myself up to say something into the mic.
[01:31.06]Here we go.
[01:31.72]I gotta be personable.
[01:33.26]I gotta be good.
[01:33.80]I gotta be a streamer.
[01:36.54]Good evening.
[01:38.93]No.
[01:41.29]We, tonight, are going to do something.
[01:42.63]We're going to play Hollow Knight.
[01:45.80]I don't know how long the stream is going to be because I am... I'm sick.
[01:49.20]I'm not cold sick.
[01:50.72]Like... I feel great up in the face area.
[01:56.03]But not in the head area and not in the tummy area.
[01:59.43]That's for sure.
[02:01.44]So, I don't know how long I'm going to be able to stream for.
[02:04.78]I don't feel well at all.
[02:06.41]So, take that as you will.
[02:09.09]And we'll get going.
[02:11.51]I'll just make a tweet.
[02:12.41]I'll be right back.
[02:13.19]See you guys in like a minute or two.
[02:18.17]Wait, what?
[02:56.26]Wait, what?
[03:03.92]Wait, what?
[03:34.42]Okay, let's switch on over here to the game.
[03:43.64]Gonna play Hollow Knight.
[03:44.30]Let's turn that volume up.
[03:47.99]Spin that around.
[03:50.29]And there we go.
[03:53.03]Hollow Knight.
[03:53.53]So this is like a Metroidvania, kind of Castlevania bosses side-scroller.
[04:01.02]I've heard very good things.
[04:03.26]So obviously, that's why I'm going to give it a try.
[04:07.50]It should be ready to go here.
[04:10.82]Sort of.
[04:13.89]Yeah!
[04:14.81]It is.
[04:17.83]It was probably an opening cutscene, so everybody shut up.
[04:21.07]No, not yet.
[04:21.59]Hold on.
[04:23.51]Alright, everybody's... If I hear one noise from anybody in the auditorium... You know like... You know like when...
[04:31.18]Alright, so you know when you go to school, and you have like an assembly at school, and there's like a couple people that are like in the back, that are like making a bunch of noise during the assembly, like the don't do drugs assembly, and then like Principal like, Principal like Evans comes up, and he's just like, Excuse me, uh, hold on, pause the assembly.
[04:48.29]Uh, can the gentleman in the back row back there please like have some respect?
[04:52.91]And he, like, fucks up the whole assembly.
[04:55.27]You know what I mean?
[04:56.81]If he just let those little shits just go on and do what they were gonna... God, I just dumped something on the ground.
[05:02.16]You know, if he just let those little shits do what they're gonna do... Like, he fucked up the assembly.
[05:09.20]So right now, I'm fucking up the stream.
[05:10.96]Because I'm, like, calling out the people that are talking.
[05:16.69]So, you know, whatever.
[05:18.57]Don't talk during the... Don't talk.
[05:23.72]What is this?
[05:25.22]Oh, ugh.
[05:26.04]No, that's fine.
[05:28.58]Adjust your brightness to your desired brightness.
[05:33.92]Alright, let's go.
[05:37.91]What do we got?
[05:40.03]Opening cutscene, right?
[05:45.21]Stop talking during the cutscene!
[05:53.92]Is that like an actual guy?
[06:03.92]Is this a real quote from this person?
[06:06.41]I don't know who that is.
[06:10.51]Was he like a philosopher back in like the 1400s?
[06:12.37]Alright, I guess I have to pay attention.
[06:34.07]I think it was accidentally skipped.
[06:35.79]Wait, what?
[06:49.67]It's so funny how, like, some notifications just, like, can turn a cutscene into just complete nonsense.
[07:04.54]This is very pretty.
[07:10.74]So now this is gonna go right into gameplay, right?
[07:12.89]Alright.
[07:13.25]I gotta be, like, prepared for this.
[07:17.71]Ooh, it's hand drawn.
[07:20.11]Everything is hand drawn in this game.
[07:21.47]If you didn't know.
[07:22.27]Okay, cool.
[07:28.11]Left and right is move.
[07:29.17]I gotta do the tutorial.
[07:30.65]Left and right is move.
[07:31.79]Got it.
[07:34.61]X to jump.
[07:36.59]If you tap X, you do a little jump.
[07:38.81]Hold X. Big jump.
[07:39.93]Okay.
[07:46.09]I already missed one of the biggest secrets of the game.
[07:50.73]They drop coins, okay.
[07:55.79]Oh, wait.
[07:56.21]Can I not go in there?
[07:59.17]I guess I can.
[08:00.11]Did I get hit by something?
[08:04.33]I don't think so.
[08:08.26]Okay, I can look up and down with the right stick.
[08:10.84]Easy enough, right?
[08:13.92]What's the range on this thing?
[08:18.25]Alright, there's coin rocks.
[08:19.76]Just like in Super Mario Brothers.
[08:23.48]It's a very, very cute game.
[08:24.78]It is, Minxy.
[08:28.48]The controls feel pretty fluid, too.
[08:32.36]I'm trying to see if there's a... Is it like a side grab?
[08:34.94]No, there's no side grab.
[08:36.48]You gotta just land on the platform.
[08:37.94]I don't know if there was a side grab or not.
[08:43.20]What was this?
[08:44.89]Interact.
[08:45.31]It's just up.
[08:46.57]Okay.
[08:49.26]higher beings these words are for you alone your great strength marks you among us focus your soul and you shall achieve feats of which others can only dream collect souls by striking enemies once enough soul is collected hold circle to focus soul and heal okay so that top left is I collect soul and I can heal and heal is circle I guess
[09:18.69]Something like that.
[09:24.21]I do like how every... Apparently... Now, according to what I've read... On the internet... This game has a lot... A lot of enemies.
[09:32.53]There's like a lot of hand-drawn enemies in this game.
[09:35.47]Alright, hold on.
[09:37.11]We're going up right now.
[09:38.07]I gotta remember to come back down here.
[09:41.06]There is a crystal here.
[09:42.06]Do I smash this?
[09:43.30]Yeah.
[09:44.68]Oh, wait.
[09:45.16]What's in there?
[09:47.44]These are like soul hearts?
[09:49.70]Yeah, these are definitely like Isaac's soul hearts, it seems.
[09:53.54]Okay.
[09:54.90]Interesting.
[09:55.92]Is there a double jump?
[09:56.62]No.
[09:58.92]Doesn't feel like there is.
[10:03.66]Do I have a map?
[10:07.49]Whoa.
[10:08.41]Okay.
[10:10.55]Well, we fell down.
[10:16.79]Okay.
[10:18.94]Going up.
[10:21.12]This is kind of like Metroid, where... Oop, wait.
[10:23.52]Found a way up.
[10:28.72]Okay, well here's another... ...inspection rock.
[10:33.65]Uh, beyond this point you enter the land of king and creator.
[10:35.91]Step across this threshold and obey our laws.
[10:38.53]Be a witness to the last and only civilization.
[10:42.65]The eternal kingdom.
[10:44.21]Hallownest.
[10:47.98]This is the point of no return?
[10:48.92]Am I like missing something here?
[10:54.32]I'm sure there's something that I can get down here that I probably might use or need, but whatever.
[10:58.42]We're just gonna go.
[11:01.67]This like just teaches me how to play.
[11:02.93]Anything else I need to like know that I don't know?
[11:08.01]I don't know.
[11:08.55]Whatever.
[11:14.33]Smash it up.
[11:21.50]Cool.
[11:22.54]I believe I'm about to start the game.
[11:30.66]Alright!
[11:32.06]Alright!
[11:35.39]Oh, Skater Dad!
[11:39.11]Skater Dad already!
[11:40.63]With like, with like the money drop.
[11:44.91]Well, Skater Dad.
[11:46.55]Thank you for the hundred bucks.
[11:49.95]And there is no message there.
[11:51.63]So... Thank you so much, dude.
[11:55.01]A hundred dollars from Skaterdad.
[11:57.27]Well, I have to do a hundred dollar joke then.
[12:01.66]There's the first fucking boss of the game.
[12:04.48]Elkenstein!
[12:07.74]There's your hundred dollar joke.
[12:09.70]No, no, no.
[12:10.40]Too robust.
[12:14.27]Ugh.
[12:15.29]His name actually was Elderbug.
[12:16.45]Okay.
[12:18.01]Oh, dear traveler, I'm afraid there's only me left to offer welcome.
[12:20.93]Our town's fallen quiet.
[12:21.93]Why am I doing it like this?
[12:23.37]I need to stop being sick so I can do this.
[12:26.21]Okay, here we go.
[12:28.43]Oh, dear traveler, I'm afraid there's only me left to offer welcome.
[12:33.22]Our town has fallen quiet, you see.
[12:36.46]The other residents, they're all disappeared.
[12:39.24]Headed down that well one by one.
[12:42.14]Alright!
[12:43.50]Into the caverns below.
[12:45.72]Alright!
[12:48.40]That was 200 fucking dollars.
[12:53.01]Somebody just gave 200 bucks.
[12:56.13]Juicy.
[12:57.83]Juicy!
[12:58.97]Just gave 200 bucks.
[13:04.11]Well, dude, I... What do I say to this?
[13:10.07]Now I have to do a 200 dollar joke.
[13:15.15]Cold medicine fund.
[13:16.26]Well, it's not a cold.
[13:17.16]It's more of a tummy issue.
[13:20.14]But, thank you to SkaterDad and Juicy.
[13:26.14]And he says the juice is loose, apparently.
[13:29.52]But, thanks a lot, guys.
[13:32.57]Big spenders.
[13:33.41]Alright, let's go back to this.
[13:40.51]Let's go back to this shit.
[13:43.17]The tummy fund?
[13:44.53]No, I'm alright, it's just like, I did a lot of puking, you know?
[13:52.10]You know when you puke a lot and it hurts to kind of even exist?
[13:56.70]It's like that.
[13:58.35]30 year old still says tummy?
[14:01.05]Stomach is a dumb word.
[14:03.19]What the fuck is a stomach?
[14:06.38]Tummy.
[14:07.46]Belly.
[14:08.74]Stomach.
[14:09.20]Alright, let's go.
[14:14.21]Uh, by the way, I just want to say, the other residents, Skater Boy and Skater Dad and Juicy Man, they've all given $200, headed down that way, one by one.
[14:25.30]It used to be there was a great kingdom beneath our town.
[14:28.45]It's long fell to ruin, yet it still draws folks into its depths.
[14:33.47]Wealth, glory, enlightenment, that darkness seems to promise all things.
[14:38.06]I'm sure you too seek your dreams down there.
[14:40.50]Alright.
[14:43.10]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[14:48.14]Hold on, Skater Dad.
[14:49.77]What the fuck just happened?
[14:54.77]Skaterdad just gave $250.
[14:55.77]Dude, that's like $350 in three minutes from you, dude.
[15:06.91]Oh my god, what the fuck happened?
[15:10.17]He says, you deserve this, I love you.
[15:11.99]Well, Skaterdad, that's a lot of money in such a short amount of time.
[15:17.98]Same thing for Juicy.
[15:19.02]Same thing for any of you guys that have given that amount of money in a short amount of time.
[15:27.67]Here comes the $550 spirit bomb joke.
[15:34.93]I don't even know if I can even... Is there even an opportunity for, like, a fucking Kamehameha joke?
[15:44.37]But that's $250 from SkaterDad, and he gave $100 earlier, too.
[15:47.74]So that's... Thanks a lot, dude.
[15:50.66]Hopefully you enjoy the stream tonight.
[15:55.28]Here we go.
[15:59.23]Yes, yes, I did.
[16:01.45]And by the way, just to let you know, you know, you did just get $550 in three minutes.
[16:06.86]You know, this town is all fucked up.
[16:08.86]Maybe you could do me a favor and buy me a sandwich and maybe an extra house or something.
[16:14.02]Please, this place is fucked.
[16:16.38]Well, watch out.
[16:17.02]It's sickly air that fills the place.
[16:19.22]Creatures turn and mad and travelers are robbed of their memories.
[16:23.19]Perhaps dreams aren't such a great thing after all.
[16:26.29]Wait, what?
[16:28.53]Oh, do not.
[16:32.38]Not do.
[16:34.70]Hallownest, it was once called.
[16:36.28]Supposedly the greatest kingdom there ever was, full of treasures and secrets.
[16:39.94]Hmm, now it's nothing more than a poisonous tomb full of monsters and madness.
[16:44.24]Everything fades eventually, I suppose.
[16:47.00]Except for your $550.
[16:48.51]If you just gave me five of that, I could go to Subway and get myself a 60% soy, 40% chicken, chicken sandwich.
[16:59.03]You heard about that in the news, didn't you?
[17:01.05]I heard about that as well.
[17:02.61]Subway, what the fuck is that bullshit?
[17:07.19]I'm gonna sit on a bench?
[17:08.05]Okay, so what does this do?
[17:12.97]No, dude.
[17:15.03]No.
[17:18.29]Skaterdad just gave Skaterdad just gave another hundred fucking dollars, dude.
[17:22.40]I don't even know what this does.
[17:28.10]And Foxy Soro just gave 15 bucks.
[17:33.45]Oh my god.
[17:35.80]You guys just, like, paid for my mortgage in, like, fucking four minutes.
[17:40.08]Holy shit, guys.
[17:41.06]Oh, thanks.
[17:46.99]Thank you, SkaterDad.
[17:47.75]He says, okay, I'm done.
[17:48.85]I promise.
[17:51.51]Don't let him play the game.
[17:52.53]Keep doing it.
[17:53.37]Oh, I'm gonna play the game.
[17:55.23]Adventures at Bonfire?
[17:57.15]Okay, that's cool.
[17:59.58]For all your mapping supplies, we'll be opening soon.
[18:01.62]Okay, so there's no maps that don't exist yet.
[18:05.48]But yeah, SkaterDad, a big salute to you, man.
[18:09.54]That's very, very kind of you.
[18:11.48]And of course, also to FoxySora who says, I'm broke as fuck, but this is for you, Jerma.
[18:15.82]Now be funny, damn you.
[18:17.22]Well, thank you for the $15.
[18:17.88]I will try to be entertained.
[18:22.61]All I care about is you guys enjoying the stream.
[18:28.45]So, hopefully that happens.
[18:33.17]I guess we went down the well.
[18:36.74]Am I dead?
[18:37.58]Oh, no.
[18:37.98]Okay.
[18:38.10]I was just seeing if it was like a one-hit-kill situation.
[18:40.96]No.
[18:42.12]So, when you get hit, here's how this game works.
[18:44.30]Apparently, when you get hit, you lose one of your Alienware computers.
[18:48.42]And there are five Alienware computers that you currently have in your backpack.
[18:52.63]And getting hit, because Alienware is so delicate, you break the computer.
[18:57.49]But holding down circle will replace one of your Alienware computers.
[19:05.56]Sounds pretty close to being a $550,000 joke.
[19:13.72]You know, it is going to be weird.
[19:14.86]This is definitely going to be a double jump, I would assume.
[19:17.28]Eventually here.
[19:19.40]I need a map.
[19:19.94]I need something.
[19:21.68]What do I need?
[19:26.10]Is it fall damage?
[19:27.70]I don't know.
[19:30.08]I'm just going to do this and see what happens.
[19:31.96]Okay.
[19:33.52]No fall damage, it seems.
[19:36.33]What does this do?
[19:38.61]Okay, so that's how you heal.
[19:39.85]It takes about, like, 15%.
[19:41.09]I will say, it is actually very fun running around just hitting stuff.
[19:53.56]Skater dad.
[19:55.60]Skater dad!
[19:58.06]Skater dad!
[20:00.36]Skater dad!
[20:03.53]Skater Dad, I'm gonna call Bank of America and tell them to turn off your card.
[20:13.18]Skater Dad just gave another hundred fucking dollars.
[20:16.88]He promised!
[20:17.98]He promised that was it.
[20:21.48]Skater Dad, like... What's the old credit limit?
[20:31.22]Oh, shit.
[20:36.15]This game is actually very fun.
[20:37.71]So far.
[20:43.64]Here comes the money.
[20:47.36]Oh, helping Llama, I missed the secret.
[20:49.46]Well, I'm gonna miss a thou- Whoa, what's that up there?
[20:53.33]There's like a lava in there.
[20:56.77]Can I- I don't think I can even jump up there at this point.
[21:00.69]No.
[21:02.11]I probably get rocket boots or something in like an hour.
[21:05.75]No.
[21:06.47]Unless I can come in the other direction.
[21:07.91]I think you're stuck there, buddy.
[21:08.95]Sorry.
[21:19.34]Well, that's a new enemy.
[21:23.12]What do I do with these coins?
[21:31.51]Oh, fuck, that guy.
[21:33.09]That's a little big.
[21:34.09]Okay, I gotta like pay attention now.
[21:37.19]I just got hurt way more than I should have.
[21:39.07]Like the dumb beetle enemy.
[21:43.66]I do love this healing feature though.
[21:45.08]This is a great feature.
[21:47.52]Truly.
[21:53.46]Well, sorry, I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[21:58.97]I'm not entirely sure what- OH!
[22:01.71]What am I supposed to be looking for?
[22:04.53]Is it anything?
[22:05.73]Or what?
[22:10.24]It's the first room with spikes.
[22:12.72]Okay, something- nope.
[22:16.96]Alright.
[22:20.33]Please.
[22:22.13]What the fuck?
[22:22.83]Like, very quickly this all just started to, like, cascade.
[22:28.74]Can't jump on that.
[22:37.20]Alright.
[22:37.46]Let's heal again.
[22:41.70]Hit the jewel rock.
[22:45.96]Plus 15.
[22:46.26]Okay.
[22:47.97]Can I read this sign or something?
[22:49.91]No.
[22:50.55]What does it want me to do?
[22:53.05]You deserve a facecam.
[22:55.05]Oh, there's like a house here.
[22:58.15]What's this?
[23:01.11]What is this?
[23:04.83]It's like a new area.
[23:05.71]I feel like I shouldn't be here right now.
[23:09.51]Somebody is singing.
[23:12.49]I hear creepy girls singing.
[23:13.91]Alright, let's investigate.
[23:17.80]Uh... Am I able to snap this person's neck?
[23:31.80]Oh, bury my mother pale and slight.
[23:33.94]Bury my father with his eyes shut tight.
[23:36.27]Bury my sisters two by two.
[23:37.75]And then when you're done, let's bury me too.
[23:39.79]Do you know that one?
[23:43.54]It's one of my favorites.
[23:46.26]We can sing something else if you like.
[23:48.08]You start singing and I'll join in.
[23:49.56]I bet you have a beautiful singing voice.
[23:54.19]So what are you doing down here?
[23:55.03]You're here to get wealthy?
[23:56.01]Just look around you.
[23:56.85]These mines are still bursting with riches.
[23:58.43]There's p-p-p-plenty for everyone.
[24:00.59]Just grab a pick and join in.
[24:01.86]Ha!
[24:07.94]Bury the knight with her broken nail.
[24:09.34]Bury the priest.
[24:10.16]Something about a crown.
[24:11.04]Can't remember the rest.
[24:12.82]Alright, I feel like this is important.
[24:18.12]Bury the knight with her broken nail.
[24:19.46]Bury the priest.
[24:21.96]Something about a skater dad giving like a fucking grand in 30 minutes.
[24:32.24]Alright, well I'm just gonna go up.
[24:34.36]Hold on a minute.
[24:36.28]But I can't... Hold on.
[24:40.33]Hold on.
[24:40.93]Hold on.
[24:41.45]Skater dad, thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.
[24:45.86]And Foxy Sporo, 1500.
[24:48.68]Not $1500, 1500 bits.
[24:51.50]15 bucks, thank you, Foxy.
[24:53.42]This one's become 5'9", too, Jerma.
[24:55.50]It's a great height.
[24:56.54]The Goldilocks height.
[25:00.15]Alright, here.
[25:00.85]I'm gonna turn on the facecam for like 12 seconds, okay?
[25:04.55]You get a 12 second facecam.
[25:06.35]I look like shit right now, and I'm in my underwear.
[25:08.77]So the camera better not be pointed down at my fucking legs.
[25:12.34]I need to make sure of this first.
[25:16.86]You get a 10 second facecam.
[25:20.08]What did I say, 12 seconds?
[25:25.78]I look like shit.
[25:27.52]You know what I mean?
[25:27.96]I've been sick for like fucking three days, guys.
[25:31.73]Four days.
[25:32.11]Alright, we're good.
[25:34.09]We're good for me just to have like my fucking dirty hair, like gross ass face on camera for five seconds.
[25:39.37]I'm okay with this.
[25:43.67]Alright, here we go.
[25:44.97]Here's your 12 second facecam.
[25:51.99]Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
[26:02.18]There it is.
[26:04.64]Alright, thank you for watching.
[26:09.54]I'll be counting.
[26:10.86]I just counted.
[26:15.54]What face?
[26:25.85]This stream is fucking gross.
[26:30.03]What shirt was that?
[26:31.09]It's an Ant-Man shirt.
[26:32.69]It's an Ant-Man.
[26:33.33]Alright, this person's, like, humming.
[26:37.09]I gotta move.
[26:37.83]I gotta move.
[26:38.31]I gotta just go up.
[26:40.67]I can't believe that I've, like... I did not expect this at all.
[26:44.42]I'm, like, sick.
[26:46.02]I need to have, like, a good stream now.
[26:48.14]Oh, what is that?
[26:48.56]I'm getting Salt and Sanctuary flashbacks.
[26:54.69]Check this, right?
[26:56.96]What is this?
[26:58.62]Should I interact with this?
[26:59.72]Hit it?
[27:04.26]Is it just a full health kind of thing, I guess?
[27:08.20]Situation here?
[27:11.51]I don't know.
[27:16.41]Nothing in these gems, though.
[27:18.51]I guess, whatever.
[27:22.79]Why do I feel like there's going to be a boss here?
[27:25.45]Or something.
[27:26.73]Significant.
[27:27.25]Does anyone remember how I even got here?
[27:32.21]Alright, well I just have to win.
[27:40.79]Or is this gonna even fall?
[27:41.73]Apparently not.
[27:46.79]What happened to the movie stream that I was gonna do?
[27:51.01]Well... The movie stream... Fuck.
[27:56.10]Uh, it needed a lot of preparation that I didn't end up getting to do, but I promise that movie stream is gonna be worth watching.
[28:04.33]Hit down?
[28:04.87]Yeah, I tried.
[28:07.65]I tried, like, jumping down.
[28:12.33]I can't swing down, I can only swing up.
[28:16.52]Oh well, maybe I have to have, like, heavy shoes or something.
[28:18.54]I'll come back.
[28:23.37]So I found this area.
[28:25.41]Whatever this place is.
[28:26.09]This is obviously later in the game.
[28:30.78]And that's that.
[28:31.58]Can I tap this again, though?
[28:37.68]And that's all I can do in here.
[28:38.80]So, singing weird person down here.
[28:41.70]Just gotta remember this is bottom right.
[28:44.16]So without a map, I'm fairly useless here.
[28:48.94]Plunging attack?
[28:52.32]Can you even do that?
[28:53.28]I can, like, swing down like that, but... Swing up, but stand upside down.
[29:06.95]Should I try that, though?
[29:09.89]I feel like that's not gonna work, but, you know what?
[29:11.49]Just for shits, I'm gonna try it.
[29:13.03]Just in case.
[29:15.39]Oh, God damn it.
[29:16.25]Somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[29:17.71]Guys.
[29:21.73]Scale Lord.
[29:23.95]Scale Lord gave $50 and said this is worth six seconds of facecam, right?
[29:27.77]No, I don't want you guys to pay for facecam.
[29:31.82]I mean, I don't want you guys to have to pay for facecam.
[29:33.78]You know what I'm saying?
[29:47.05]You know what I'm saying?
[29:47.89]I don't want to even have to think about this.
[29:51.08]I don't want to even have to think about this, you know what I mean?
[29:54.60]Like, you know, what do you think I am?
[29:55.98]Some kind of fucking sellout streamer?
[29:57.76]You think I'm some kind of like... You guys, what?
[29:59.60]You think I'm some kind of sellout streamer?
[30:01.28]What do you think I am?
[30:01.76]Some kind of sellout to people?
[30:04.02]You think that's what it is?
[30:07.30]You think that's it?
[30:08.68]You think that's what this is?
[30:22.42]That's not true.
[30:23.04]That's a joke.
[30:23.60]Don't fucking do that.
[30:24.94]Don't do that shit.
[30:26.54]No.
[30:26.94]Alright, so that doesn't work.
[30:38.95]More than six seconds.
[30:41.87]Put that ugly thing away.
[30:43.23]No.
[30:43.65]You cannot pay for a facecam.
[30:46.40]You understand?
[30:46.98]That's never going to be a reality.
[30:50.42]No.
[30:50.64]No.
[30:52.69]That was a joke.
[30:53.44]That was a little stream jokey joke that we just did.
[30:57.48]If you donate money and you ask for a face game, I ain't gonna do it.
[31:01.58]That was for Holy Mackerel to use as like a jokey joke.
[31:05.40]So let's go.
[31:05.86]Where did I come from?
[31:06.45]Down?
[31:07.97]I really want a fucking map so bad.
[31:14.65]Oh, fuck.
[31:15.29]Who is this guy?
[31:16.09]Oh, God.
[31:16.59]What is this?
[31:18.07]Am I ready for this?
[31:18.63]I don't know if I'm ready for this.
[31:21.26]I'm not ready for this.
[31:21.80]I'm not ready for this.
[31:28.12]I'm not ready for this.
[31:41.03]Ah!
[31:42.73]I can't.
[31:42.97]How do I get around him?
[31:55.62]Okay.
[31:56.20]I think I get it.
[32:00.08]Got him.
[32:00.58]First try.
[32:02.14]Beat the first boss first try.
[32:08.23]Then I rescued one of these Pokemons.
[32:12.67]What does this do for me?
[32:15.75]What'd I do?
[32:20.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[32:23.45]Did you just...
[32:26.18]Did you just give a hundred bucks again, Skaterdad?
[32:29.54]Thanks for the facecam.
[32:36.11]What do the caterpillars do?
[32:43.25]I guess I just did it, I guess.
[32:44.81]Whatever that means.
[32:45.51]Did you go back to town or something?
[32:48.73]I missed a hundred bucks?
[32:49.65]No, I didn't.
[32:50.09]Did I?
[32:50.65]No way.
[32:51.16]No, Skaterdad just said thanks for facecam.
[32:57.00]Skaterdad is, like, single-handedly gonna send me to, like, Disney World.
[33:07.35]Alright, Skaterdad, I promise, like, I'm gonna go to, like, Disney World with, like, the fucking $7,000 you're giving me, and I'm gonna buy, like, a skateboard.
[33:16.42]But thank you.
[33:18.38]Thank you.
[33:18.78]Alright, I came over here.
[33:20.46]Let's go this way.
[33:27.11]Skaterdad's the game dev.
[33:35.35]That's two for those guys.
[33:41.92]Is this the send me to Disney World stream?
[33:46.44]Can I drop down here?
[33:48.20]Is this a pit or is this a way to go?
[33:50.22]Let's check.
[33:53.46]It's a way to go.
[33:55.63]But I can't get out of here.
[33:57.63]Okay, well, these have to be open somehow.
[34:02.87]There's a lever.
[34:05.26]VI-vive?
[34:06.66]Vive time?
[34:11.04]Well, let's... I got that caterpillar.
[34:15.82]Watch out for the falling stalactites.
[34:17.88]Remember guys, you can always tell if it's a stalactite or a stalagmite.
[34:23.86]Why is that?
[34:25.42]Because a stalactite, tight, like it has to be tight so it holds on to the ceiling, so it has to be tight.
[34:31.47]Stalagmite grows from the ground and it has to be mighty so it can bury itself, its roots into the ground.
[34:40.89]You know what I mean?
[34:43.33]There you go, there's your lesson.
[34:45.99]Foxy Soro again.
[34:46.99]Foxy Soro, for all the hundred dollars that have been being dropped, you're up there now too.
[34:53.83]This equals one cinnamon churro?
[34:56.65]Well, thank you, Foxy.
[35:00.47]It's stalactite.
[35:04.51]It has to be tight, so it has to grip the surface of the Earth.
[35:08.55]I mean, it has to grip the ceiling of the Earth.
[35:15.94]Where have I not gone?
[35:16.66]Hey, whoa, there's a person in there.
[35:18.32]Oh, they're dead.
[35:18.70]I don't think I've gone this way yet.
[35:22.87]If I have, then whatever.
[35:25.87]It's all about exploring.
[35:33.37]We haven't gone up.
[35:35.97]I love all these shy guys.
[35:38.29]Remember the shy guys that can fly in Mario 2?
[35:41.85]They've transitioned to this game.
[35:47.40]The money stream.
[35:49.72]Sometimes it just happens.
[35:50.94]And there's nothing I can really like... Nothing I can do about it.
[35:55.14]All I can do is say thank you for the money.
[35:56.86]That's all I can do.
[36:01.39]What is this?
[36:03.99]Like it shocks me every day.
[36:05.63]That somebody is willing to give me like $500.
[36:11.15]So I have to make it worth it.
[36:13.33]And this summer.
[36:14.63]This summer.
[36:15.77]I fucking promise.
[36:18.12]Promise you one thing if there's one thing that you could I can actually truly promise you is over the summer You're gonna see some shit that is gonna take a lot of time a lot of money and a lot of work so Hopefully it'll be worth it, but I rescued this guy, right?
[36:35.55]We just gave me a bunch of money this is a secret I
[36:45.21]So I'm assuming there's like 30 or 40 of these things in the game, and you have to find them.
[36:50.67]Grandpa Slug gets really happy.
[36:54.38]Well, this is where they are.
[36:55.12]Okay.
[36:56.16]What about down lower left?
[37:02.52]Thank you, Juicy, again for the 15 bucks.
[37:06.94]Fast pass fund.
[37:11.38]Funding the Fast Pass.
[37:16.69]Okay, that's fucking funny.
[37:18.43]That's funny.
[37:23.33]I haven't gone this way.
[37:24.15]We'll check here.
[37:24.71]And then the lower left is the only place besides this I haven't gone.
[37:29.42]I like this, though.
[37:31.78]I'm actually... Oh, wait.
[37:34.00]Where am I?
[37:34.70]But this is...
[37:39.01]This is the first area of the game?
[37:44.53]Yeah, this needs like a key, I guess.
[37:47.19]Stone door with a simple lock, whatever.
[37:49.97]Renegade coaster with 50 bucks.
[37:52.75]Can I buy six seconds of auto cam?
[37:55.35]No, no, we're not buying cameras.
[37:57.01]We're not buying cameras.
[38:05.18]Mapping supplies.
[38:07.78]Well, we'll go lower left.
[38:08.80]That's the only place we haven't gone.
[38:10.82]But, uh, seriously, Renegade, thank you for the money.
[38:13.18]Thank you for the money is all I can say.
[38:14.54]Thank you for the money!
[38:20.68]You guys spoiled me fucking rotten.
[38:24.99]Like, rotten.
[38:32.73]So where have I not gone?
[38:33.59]Just all the way down here on the left?
[38:34.75]Alright, now I've gone in there.
[38:40.90]Down here.
[38:42.12]Ooh, that hurt.
[38:43.18]I don't think I've been in here.
[38:47.26]Uh, no, I have not been this way.
[38:49.26]Let's check it.
[38:55.61]Also, we had... What did we miss?
[38:57.09]Did I miss one?
[38:57.93]Swiggity Stag, five bucks.
[39:01.11]Say hi to Miserable Mikey for me when you go to the Quizney Planet.
[39:06.09]Don't worry.
[39:06.77]Miserable... Oh, fuck.
[39:07.98]I don't know.
[39:08.28]Like, boss.
[39:08.86]Alright, we gotta first try this guy, too.
[39:11.77]I have to first try every boss.
[39:13.87]Are they gonna hit that back at him, probably?
[39:22.31]No?
[39:25.84]I'm not sure.
[39:26.36]I mean, I would think that would shoot it back at him.
[39:34.54]Maybe I can't go over here yet.
[39:36.80]Maybe I need a ranged weapon.
[39:40.04]I'm just gonna see what happens if he does this a few times.
[39:44.24]Does he, like, charge or anything?
[39:45.34]Or no, I probably need a ranged weapon.
[39:47.88]Yeah, whatever, he'll go up.
[39:52.97]Clutch or kick?
[39:55.79]Travelers of Hallownest descend through the verdant wilds and fungal groves to the city of this kingdom's heart, where all wishes shall be granted, all truths revealed.
[40:01.97]Can I not go in here?
[40:08.94]Yeah, I can't fight this dude.
[40:10.74]Okay, well, we'll keep going down lower left.
[40:15.45]Ska... Skaalor, thank you, says, name your firstborn child Skater Dad.
[40:21.61]Well, something tells me I don't want to necessarily do that because... That'd be really odd.
[40:27.82]That'd be a very odd name for a kid.
[40:33.40]What if I was a girl?
[40:35.92]Yeah, you know, here's just, you know... This is my daughter.
[40:39.37]She's our firstborn daughter.
[40:41.75]Oh, she's so beautiful.
[40:43.01]What are we gonna name her?
[40:44.67]Skater Dad!
[40:51.91]Well, this is... different.
[40:56.06]Oh!
[40:57.96]You know, I like when you get hit in this game, because the game freeze frames, and you kind of get to see what's going on, and where you could possibly go to escape it.
[41:06.24]I don't think I want to do that.
[41:07.48]That thing is like a full recharge, right?
[41:08.84]What the fuck is this?
[41:17.10]Well, I don't have any wall jump ability yet, so I can't do that.
[41:25.22]Or even if it's like a son.
[41:27.54]Oh yes, my son.
[41:29.87]Skater dad.
[41:37.47]It's a family name.
[41:40.01]Well, it looks like we're going down even more.
[41:47.02]Down here?
[41:47.48]I hear another person.
[41:56.50]You look like you have something.
[41:57.88]Hello there.
[42:01.24]Come down to explore these beautiful old ruins.
[42:03.07]Don't mind me.
[42:04.57]I have a fondness for exploring myself.
[42:06.59]Getting lost and finding your way again is a pleasure like no other.
[42:09.93]We're exquisitely lucky, you and I. I'm a cartographer by trade, and I'm working on mapping this area right now.
[42:16.76]Would you like to buy a copy of my work so far?
[42:20.64]Uh, yeah.
[42:22.48]There's the map, baby.
[42:25.48]LB.
[42:26.48]To view a map of the current area.
[42:28.22]View a detailed map of Hollow Nest in the map pane of the inventory.
[42:31.12]Okay.
[42:32.69]A map can be a useful thing, but alone won't show you where you're going.
[42:36.74]If you're not the head for directions, I suggest purchasing a compass from my wife, Iselda.
[42:42.82]She's just now opening our new map shop in Dirtman, selling all sorts of useful things to wanderers like yourself.
[42:48.11]She'll even sell some of my old maps from time to time.
[42:51.89]I pop back to see her whenever I finish mapping an area.
[42:54.35]She's always excited to see me.
[42:55.99]Okay.
[43:01.06]So now that map shop is open.
[43:02.66]I see a scary face guy.
[43:04.24]Anything else?
[43:08.98]Oh, by the way, I haven't introduced you to myself.
[43:11.25]Do you have IS?
[43:12.89]I should apologize for that.
[43:14.47]When you spend a lot of time by yourself with just your own thoughts, you forget the niceties of conversation.
[43:20.39]My name is Cornifer, and I've always loved exploring the world.
[43:23.52]Why, when I was first hatched and I wandered off immediately, leaving my brothers and sisters and poor mother behind.
[43:28.00]That's why as soon as I could move to Dirtmouth with my wife, I did a huge unending kingdom.
[43:33.54]Yeah.
[43:35.08]Anyway, I'll let you return to your travels.
[43:36.94]With a little luck, we'll meet again.
[43:38.76]Be safe and farewell.
[43:45.76]I now have a map.
[43:47.24]But what does that do for me?
[43:48.54]Where am I currently?
[43:51.82]Where's the UR here?
[43:52.80]Am I going to be able to get back up if I drop down here?
[43:59.76]I guess.
[44:00.14]I don't know what I'm looking at here.
[44:07.77]I guess I need the compass.
[44:09.59]Maybe I should just go get the compass.
[44:12.95]That's what I'm going to do.
[44:14.95]Oh yeah.
[44:17.52]Go by the compass, then I assume it tells you where you are.
[44:19.56]Oh, fuck.
[44:25.65]Oh, no.
[44:26.65]What is this?
[44:28.25]What is this?
[44:30.07]Why am I locked in here with this fucking, like, puss sack?
[44:37.07]What?
[44:37.51]Is this, like, a mini-boss or something?
[44:39.17]Okay, that's weird.
[44:45.85]Oh, it's like a little... It's a little fight the enemy area.
[44:49.85]And I have to probably fight, like, the sick waves, and it'll finally open, I guess.
[44:52.99]If I were to take a guess... Yep, there it is.
[44:57.45]Okay.
[45:03.27]Interesting, I guess.
[45:04.83]I should go buy that compass, though.
[45:06.07]Alright, this is a bad idea.
[45:08.85]Yeah.
[45:10.80]Although the compass isn't that expensive.
[45:20.77]Where the fuck am I going?
[45:23.09]Ooh, ooh!
[45:24.83]Money vines!
[45:25.47]I'm gonna need Skater Dad to help buy the compass.
[45:33.35]Skater Dad's gonna have to do a little bit of investment here.
[45:36.11]No.
[45:39.32]He already did.
[45:39.94]Hold on one second, I'm gonna move this down.
[45:53.30]Let's get back up there.
[45:54.38]I can't imagine this compass being more than, like, a hundred.
[45:59.59]We're eventually going to have to come down here anyway, so... Whatever.
[46:09.71]Don't tempt him.
[46:12.51]We go back up to Dirtmouth.
[46:15.24]Let's see what has changed.
[46:17.62]It's a great name for a town, by the way.
[46:19.28]Dirtmouth.
[46:26.14]Ow.
[46:30.72]Can't wait till somebody speedruns this game.
[46:32.18]It's gonna be so cool.
[46:36.60]Where am I going?
[46:37.68]I'm gonna go, like, up and to the right.
[46:40.97]Um... Where the hell am I?
[46:51.07]It's this way, right?
[46:54.34]Yeah, okay.
[46:59.55]How much money to shove a handful of moist soil in my mouth?
[47:04.42]Uh, zero.
[47:05.28]I ain't gonna do that.
[47:05.88]Alright, here we go.
[47:07.48]It's up.
[47:11.80]There she is.
[47:15.04]Come to buy a map, have you?
[47:16.40]It's really my husband.
[47:17.30]I'm doing the same voice.
[47:18.31]I'm doing the same one.
[47:23.19]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:28.07]Okay, hold on.
[47:30.57]Whoa, 220!
[47:30.99]Do it for free?
[47:39.49]What is all this shit?
[47:40.21]Okay, hold on.
[47:41.37]This is a lot of money.
[47:45.19]Oh, pinpoint your location on your map.
[47:46.49]Incredibly helpful for finding your... Yeah, I'm just gonna get this, right?
[47:53.15]I'm just gonna buy it.
[47:54.71]Wayward compass.
[47:58.19]Okay, I just spent like all my money.
[48:01.40]Equip a charm to activate its powerful abilities.
[48:04.44]Open the charms menu while resting at a bench.
[48:06.47]Okay.
[48:12.79]I'm going to go to the bench.
[48:19.53]And to equip a charm from the charms menu, I'll press this.
[48:21.79]Ooh.
[48:24.95]There's a lot of charms here.
[48:26.65]So I have three notches.
[48:35.57]Okay.
[48:36.81]Well, whatever.
[48:41.03]Now that'll pinpoint me.
[48:43.58]Yeah, that's so much better.
[48:44.92]I can't imagine not having this.
[48:47.26]How could you ever not have this?
[48:52.77]Well, let's keep exploring.
[48:56.18]So where do we want to go?
[48:58.96]Looks like... Either lower left or all the way to the right.
[49:05.22]There's a lot of areas on the right that I haven't gone to, so let's try those.
[49:11.12]We'll go all the way down to the right and see if I can do that.
[49:19.57]The music in this game is actually very nice.
[49:21.37]Yeah, it is.
[49:23.63]It is.
[49:26.89]Wait, what was that?
[49:29.78]What is this?
[49:33.66]Temple of the Black Egg.
[49:40.30]Oh.
[49:40.91]Hello there.
[49:42.05]How delightful to meet another traveler on these forgotten roads.
[49:44.85]You're a short one.
[49:46.15]You're stupid, but you've a strong look about you.
[49:55.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:58.37]So this is a huge egg.
[50:00.21]A giant egg.
[50:02.09]It's Lavos.
[50:08.10]Mm-hmm.
[50:10.12]This is just a Chrono Trigger game.
[50:18.11]Okay, so I found the final boss.
[50:23.96]What a time to choose to arrive.
[50:24.82]This dead world has sprung to life.
[50:26.34]The creatures are riled up and the Earth rumbles.
[50:27.86]The air is thick.
[50:28.92]I wonder what could have brought it all about.
[50:30.20]It was definitely you, Lavos.
[50:31.64]I think that's all he can say.
[50:42.68]That old nail alone just won't be enough, though that's no problem.
[50:45.32]One only has to look around.
[50:47.18]Plenty have come before us and most have met their grizzly end.
[50:49.48]Many more equipped than you and I.
[50:52.14]I'm sure they wouldn't mind if we're a fellow explorer to relieve them of their tools.
[50:55.54]It's kindness, really.
[50:56.87]The dead shouldn't be burdened with such things.
[51:00.19]Okay.
[51:02.71]Well, there's the final boss of the game.
[51:07.49]It's the final boss.
[51:12.22]And when I fight, it's gonna go...
[51:13.88]That's only for Chrono Trigger fans.
[51:28.41]Only for Chrono Trigger fans that understand that.
[51:30.09]So we're gonna go down and then right.
[51:34.71]Try that first.
[51:35.37]Hmm.
[51:37.91]Yeah, we've already been in there.
[51:39.21]We have not been over here though, right?
[51:42.70]Guess not.
[51:46.20]I have though.
[51:46.96]I did go over here.
[51:47.62]Yeah, this is a place I couldn't go.
[52:01.51]There's like three spots here.
[52:05.93]I can't go down here either.
[52:08.16]Well, shit.
[52:13.00]So there's the boss, but I need to get this open.
[52:15.90]How the fuck do I open this?
[52:22.18]Do I need to just save up money and buy some more shit?
[52:25.50]Maybe.
[52:26.62]Well, I'm dead.
[52:27.72]I don't know.
[52:34.84]I don't know, it's vague.
[52:44.45]All that other shit was like a hundred, right?
[52:45.81]I guess I'll just save up some money.
[52:52.42]Need to collect cash.
[53:01.40]Might as well drink the Estus.
[53:08.99]Currently above this guy.
[53:11.32]vagary ensues.
[53:12.64]Yeah, it is fairly vague, but you know... That's what these games are.
[53:25.73]I'm just gonna go in a money collection.
[53:35.15]Kill the flying bugs.
[53:37.39]It was 100, right?
[53:46.45]Can you say, hey gamers, for me?
[53:48.79]Why do you want me to say, hey gamers?
[53:51.75]There's no opportunity for me to say, hey gamers, yet.
[53:55.25]Something crazy has to happen.
[53:56.37]I gotta fight, like, the first boss, and I gotta make sure my, like, my mouse and keyboard is, like, the best product it could be, you know?
[54:02.66]We're not using a keyboard.
[54:04.68]I'm using a PlayStation 4 controller.
[54:06.52]There's no, hey gamers, there.
[54:12.60]Ow.
[54:12.72]Ow.
[54:14.29]Ow, ow, ow!
[54:15.91]Okay, there's no fall damage at all.
[54:18.56]That's good to know.
[54:23.80]Down there is a map guy.
[54:24.82]I'm just looking for a hundred bucks.
[54:29.53]Once I have a hundred bucks, I'm going back up and I'm going to buy something else.
[54:33.29]Hopefully like a ranged weapon.
[54:40.95]Bugs?
[54:41.35]What?
[54:41.57]What?
[54:44.96]What microphone do I use?
[54:47.21]I use a Razer Micro Plus.
[54:52.91]675 Adder 51.
[54:53.49]Fuck.
[55:03.92]Almost there.
[55:04.42]Almost at 100 bucks.
[55:05.28]I'm going to get a little bit over 100 too.
[55:10.74]I'm not just going to go with 100.
[55:12.10]I'm going to get more than that.
[55:15.28]Where's all the cash?
[55:15.96]Where are the mineral veins?
[55:24.91]That's where the weird caterpillar people are.
[55:28.39]Let's heal.
[55:31.63]Joke opportunity ruined?
[55:35.65]Was there a joke opportunity there?
[55:44.92]It's gonna break everything.
[55:47.26]Oh, there we go.
[55:47.72]Nice.
[55:48.50]Perfect.
[55:50.72]Perfect.
[55:51.02]Alright, I got way more than a hundred now.
[55:53.13]Let's check it.
[56:00.01]Do I use an electric razor?
[56:01.15]No, I use a safety razor.
[56:03.69]I use one of those grandfather safety razors.
[56:06.63]Okay, what can I buy from you now?
[56:13.63]Bapanada.
[56:14.87]Quill.
[56:16.91]You'll need this if you want to update your map with new areas you explore.
[56:20.26]It's essential for anyone serious about mapping.
[56:22.52]Bench pin.
[56:23.84]Will mark benches and other rest stops.
[56:26.26]Cocoon pin.
[56:28.50]Keep track of cocoons.
[56:30.64]Vendor pin.
[56:33.93]Or hot spring pin.
[56:36.37]I mean, a quill, right?
[56:41.73]These are like the two essentials.
[56:43.97]I would assume.
[56:44.45]It has to be, right?
[56:46.99]Because these are just marks of hot springs.
[56:48.94]Like, whatever.
[56:50.50]It's just map stuff.
[56:53.10]Well, I mean, I want to have it, you know?
[56:57.38]Does this need to be equipped?
[57:07.88]Pay the bill.
[57:08.78]Get the quill.
[57:11.26]Let's get it.
[57:16.35]Let's just get it.
[57:16.89]I don't have to equip that, right?
[57:20.57]Is it just on?
[57:24.67]Inventory.
[57:26.33]Old nail.
[57:27.49]So there's other weapons.
[57:28.45]Map and quill.
[57:29.73]Alright, so let's rest at a bench.
[57:33.93]Let's see what happens.
[57:38.37]Map updated.
[57:41.05]Map has been updated.
[57:41.97]Okay.
[57:47.01]It's like filling this shit in.
[57:48.31]That's weird.
[57:54.09]You can only update a map and a bench.
[57:55.93]Alright, well.
[57:57.69]Okay.
[57:59.17]So.
[58:01.59]Shit's getting filled in.
[58:02.59]Now the real question is, I have not gone all the way down there.
[58:11.30]We're going that way.
[58:15.49]So it looks like down, down, and then left is where I have not been to.
[58:22.80]Time to do some exploring.
[58:26.52]This game's pretty unique.
[58:27.66]This actually is very fun.
[58:31.87]I don't really have any complaints at all so far.
[58:35.57]It seems fairly straightforward, fairly fun.
[58:37.83]Alright, where do I need to go?
[58:41.48]All the way down.
[58:44.81]Heal.
[58:45.63]That puts us here.
[58:51.97]So we go down again.
[58:53.19]And this is where I have not gone.
[58:55.46]Over here.
[58:59.16]Here we go.
[58:59.54]I'm assuming there's new weapons and items in.
[59:06.58]Yeah, take a look.
[59:07.18]There's some tremors now.
[59:10.48]I don't think I can hurt him.
[59:11.30]I just have to avoid him.
[59:16.16]I'm gonna look for an advanced tactic here, guys.
[59:21.38]That was an advanced tactic, but I didn't get it.
[59:24.97]Like damage canceling, right?
[59:26.25]I gotta do the damage canceling and get up there.
[59:32.87]Let's heal.
[59:33.37]Alright.
[59:39.03]Keep on moving.
[59:42.97]Still going.
[59:43.55]I have to update the map if I want any of this to, you know, be updated.
[59:50.41]So it tells me where I was.
[59:51.51]That's kind of cool.
[59:54.29]That's pretty interesting.
[59:55.77]The fact that this map is not updating.
[59:57.40]I have to actually go sit on a bench to write it in.
[60:00.80]Oh, and there's another caterpillar.
[60:06.52]So that's what's over here.
[60:08.04]That's done with.
[60:10.45]I still don't get what that even is supposed to do.
[60:12.25]I don't know.
[60:14.49]That's all I can do over here, though.
[60:20.94]There's literally Mario paint.
[60:28.64]Be careful I don't, uh... If you weren't around when the Earth was first created... What?
[60:38.46]I really want to get up there, but I kind of can't.
[60:43.50]So now we just go to the right.
[60:46.22]I think I'm going to fight the first boss here.
[60:47.73]I assume that's what's going to be coming up fairly quickly.
[61:02.15]Yeah, I can see him on that map there.
[61:09.34]Let's just go... Wait, I didn't... What's up here?
[61:13.61]Another super secret.
[61:19.59]Hot springs.
[61:22.76]And a bench.
[61:24.02]Hey, look at that.
[61:24.74]Map updated.
[61:26.34]This is cool.
[61:27.28]I like this a lot.
[61:29.22]Oh yeah, this is fucking great.
[61:31.48]This is real great.
[61:37.04]You're probably gonna see me play this game for a while.
[61:40.10]I can already tell that.
[61:46.22]Now, what does the hot spring do, I wonder?
[61:47.82]This probably heals you and it's like a little rest spot.
[61:50.25]A little bonfire spot.
[61:54.59]Can't get up here.
[61:56.25]Let's go down this way.
[61:58.09]Oh shit!
[61:58.61]You were in the ground.
[62:04.57]I really hope there's more stuff to buy too.
[62:10.69]It's a relaxing stream.
[62:11.81]Yeah, we're just kind of chilling.
[62:15.86]I say that now, and then we're gonna get to a boss, and I'm gonna be like, fuck this game!
[62:19.84]This game sucks!
[62:21.06]Like, who made this game?
[62:22.06]A fucking six-year-old?
[62:23.66]That's, like, probably gonna happen.
[62:27.12]So just, like, let's enjoy it for what it is right now.
[62:29.13]You know?
[62:29.61]A good, fun game.
[62:30.55]And I, like, I wanna stop having those bunch up over here.
[62:33.75]I wanna get those.
[62:46.50]Jump, jump, jump.
[62:48.96]I don't sound sick.
[62:49.72]I am not, like, cold sick.
[62:52.42]I am stomach sick.
[62:55.94]I am, like, puke sick.
[63:00.49]I am, like, intestine sick.
[63:05.09]My face is okay.
[63:06.11]I have, like, a headache, but it's mainly a stomach situation currently going on here.
[63:18.85]Okay, I'm gonna go up.
[63:25.29]This boss that's up here in the middle, there'll be a shortcut to him, I would assume.
[63:28.43]And I can't go that way.
[63:29.35]I'm gonna have to drop down.
[63:31.31]I want that.
[63:31.99]I'm gonna get it.
[63:32.83]I'm gonna hit the ceiling, I think, if I jump.
[63:44.18]Nope.
[63:45.16]I do want that, so...
[63:48.33]Give me the money!
[63:50.35]I mean, this is a money stream.
[63:51.49]Might as well get the money, right?
[63:57.62]Hmm.
[64:04.52]I wonder if there's anything over there that I can get.
[64:07.60]Yeah, there's more money.
[64:08.26]I'm gonna go up that way.
[64:13.57]You can tell when I'm having a good time when I want to get the stuff.
[64:16.51]Right?
[64:17.35]Like, I want to go get that.
[64:19.27]I don't want to just skip it.
[64:21.02]I want to collect it.
[64:25.58]That's how you can tell when Jeremy's having a decent time in the game.
[64:28.44]When he's like, you know, I kind of want to get that stuff.
[64:34.40]Shit, that's going to be a pain in the ass to get all that.
[64:49.08]Okay, well, I can't get that one.
[64:50.86]It's alright.
[64:51.84]I got most of it.
[64:59.03]Hmm.
[65:00.19]Down?
[65:00.53]Let's just see what's... No, there's a little shortcut.
[65:04.91]Remember the lever I could switch up here?
[65:07.45]There's a switch.
[65:13.80]Flip the switch, which will lead right to a shortcut.
[65:18.34]Right?
[65:18.54]Okay.
[65:23.82]From what I remember, I couldn't come down here.
[65:27.79]But I will now.
[65:30.11]And that will lead me right to a super shortcut.
[65:34.93]And then the switch.
[65:38.03]Told ya!
[65:40.05]Boink.
[65:45.07]Not entirely sure if that's really that big of a deal.
[65:48.03]But, you know, it's there now.
[65:49.35]It's switched.
[65:51.78]And I can go over here.
[65:55.97]Oh, dear.
[65:58.09]Oh!
[65:58.93]Whoa!
[65:59.13]What's in here?
[66:00.51]Where's my block?
[66:05.63]Okay, now we leave.
[66:06.53]Get out.
[66:07.07]Get out.
[66:07.35]Get out.
[66:07.59]I don't know what this is.
[66:11.14]I don't know what that is.
[66:13.18]I must need, like, a lantern or something to go in there.
[66:17.50]Oh, God.
[66:18.30]Now I fucked it all up.
[66:22.69]Whatever, I have the switches flipped.
[66:25.05]Let's go see what this is.
[66:26.11]Let's go check out the... Whatever is over here.
[66:36.07]Looks like there's a big guy, one of these big dudes.
[66:39.93]Come on, do it.
[67:03.40]Ooh, you dropped a lot of stuff.
[67:05.08]Cool.
[67:07.02]Well, that's not the boss, but that leads me over here?
[67:13.83]Whatever is down here?
[67:14.81]Hopefully there's a bench or something here.
[67:19.11]Alright, well.
[67:29.02]Uh... Here we go.
[67:33.91]Good luck.
[67:36.61]Room with giant horns.
[67:38.63]Here we go.
[67:42.03]First boss of the video game, I think.
[67:47.71]Let's see what it is.
[67:56.99]Hopefully I'm prepared for this.
[68:00.56]Is there anything even in here?
[68:03.41]Oh, no.
[68:06.38]Oh, shit!
[68:07.00]Okay.
[68:08.00]The false knight.
[68:10.96]He does a jump.
[68:11.52]He does a jump.
[68:12.36]He's jump slam.
[68:13.12]Okay.
[68:14.00]There's not a good place to be.
[68:15.06]Okay, I don't even know what the fuck he's doing.
[68:21.06]Alright, when he jumps in the air like that, I can't go through him.
[68:27.01]I, like, just... I have no idea what the fuck's even going on.
[68:30.87]He does that.
[68:31.79]Big wave.
[68:34.39]Jump.
[68:34.91]He does a big overhead swing.
[68:36.97]Like that.
[68:37.49]Okay.
[68:37.95]Here comes the wave.
[68:49.98]Big smash.
[69:05.97]No big deal at all, right?
[69:08.21]How do I kill him?
[69:08.89]What do I do?
[69:09.97]Oh!
[69:11.57]Hit him in his puffy face!
[69:12.63]Holy Jesus!
[69:17.58]What the fuck?
[69:18.08]He's changing!
[69:19.60]Oh my god, he... Okay, I'm gonna, like, die.
[69:27.63]Okay, this shit is now getting new.
[69:50.73]Here we go, here we go.
[69:51.27]Right in his face.
[69:52.83]You gotta heal.
[69:58.17]In a second he freaks out.
[70:00.61]Cool.
[70:01.09]Make him have to wave.
[70:10.94]Make him have to wave!
[70:17.70]Overhead smash!
[70:19.59]Ooh, shit!
[70:20.37]Easy.
[70:26.17]Alright, this has got to be the one, right?
[70:27.31]It's over.
[70:31.51]Not yet!
[70:32.49]Not yet!
[70:32.97]Whoa!
[70:37.89]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[70:40.51]Where'd he go?
[70:40.87]Where'd he go?
[70:43.20]Oh!
[70:46.76]Wait, this is like Mortal Kombat!
[70:49.72]We, like, dropped down a level.
[70:54.02]Oh my god, is that it?
[70:54.68]Did I get him?
[70:56.72]He's dead.
[70:58.22]That means I get a suit of armor, right?
[71:00.18]And I become Earthworm Jim.
[71:04.97]Nice.
[71:05.29]Okay, he's dead.
[71:06.01]City Crest.
[71:11.77]That was fun.
[71:18.52]What is that?
[71:19.24]What is this fucking, like, hemorrhoid?
[71:21.86]Get the fuck out of here.
[71:29.97]Let me see what that is.
[71:31.59]City crest, stone slab bearing the crest of the hollow nest, capital city.
[71:35.31]Has an insert in the back that would fit into a slot.
[71:38.33]Okay.
[71:43.13]No secrets, nothing else?
[71:45.93]Well, there is this thing over here.
[71:47.45]Whatever the fuck this, like, weird dome is.
[71:50.58]What is this?
[71:53.22]Oh, wowie!
[71:55.40]Wow!
[71:57.14]Okay, that was a lot of money.
[72:04.27]Cool.
[72:08.97]Call false knight.
[72:10.19]He's crying.
[72:14.57]That was fun.
[72:15.81]This is fun.
[72:16.47]I like this game.
[72:18.83]This is currently getting the Jeremy stamp of approval at this point.
[72:23.25]I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[72:30.85]Which I probably did, but whatever.
[72:32.13]Let's just go.
[72:39.30]I need a bench so I can write this stuff down.
[72:42.82]Why did I kill Bug Boy?
[72:43.78]Because Bug Boy came at me with an axe.
[72:48.12]Come on, guys.
[72:48.61]You gotta give me a break.
[72:50.23]He may have been like a little Bug Boy, but he tried to kill me with a fucking axe.
[72:54.23]What am I supposed to do?
[72:57.91]Just let him kill me?
[73:04.34]This is new.
[73:04.82]Hold on.
[73:08.56]Okay.
[73:11.48]Remember the five-hour tutorial?
[73:13.14]Neither do I. Plus 5.2 game rating.
[73:16.18]I know, right?
[73:18.90]Seriously.
[73:20.66]The game... Look.
[73:21.74]This game did exactly what it needed to have happen, right?
[73:25.09]It gave me, like, the control settings.
[73:27.43]It told me, like, two very important things and was like, go play the game and have fun.
[73:33.05]Let's see what... Um... That's not a charm?
[73:40.00]That, like, city crest thing?
[73:44.94]Oh, okay.
[73:46.38]What the fuck is it then?
[73:49.92]Oh, who is that creeping out of the darkness?
[73:51.36]My, you're looking grim.
[73:52.26]A strange empty face and a wicked looking weapon.
[73:55.12]Something important has thrown you down to the hollow nest corpse.
[73:57.98]I won't ask what.
[73:59.04]Perhaps the reason you found me is because you need my help.
[74:02.00]Say no more, friend.
[74:02.77]I'm going to give you a gift.
[74:03.93]A nasty little spell of my own creation.
[74:06.15]It's just perfect for a little one like you.
[74:08.31]Woo-hoo-hoo!
[74:13.24]Get my first new ability or what?
[74:15.42]Just like Mega Man?
[74:22.91]Cutscene?
[74:25.29]Consume the vengeful spirit.
[74:26.73]Tap circle to unleash the spirit.
[74:29.23]Spells will deplete soul.
[74:33.01]Okay.
[74:37.58]I think I found a... Well, there's our way to get past that beetle that was shooting the fireballs, right?
[74:46.57]Oh, you've woken at last.
[74:47.33]I apologize.
[74:47.89]Perhaps I should have warned you about the power of that spell.
[74:50.19]I was watching over you as you slept, but seemed to have slipped away myself.
[74:54.52]Now we're awake, I was wondering whether you would do me a small favor.
[74:58.38]Not as repayment for my gift, of course, simply because we're now friends.
[75:02.42]You see, a horrid great beast has made its home in the heart of this temple.
[75:05.16]Such disrespect.
[75:06.88]I would be quite grateful if you would venture deeper in and slay it for me.
[75:10.57]It's a hearty creature, but with your new power, you're more than a match for it.
[75:13.17]Good luck with this small favor, my friend.
[75:22.02]So what, I can't leave until I kill the monster?
[75:27.66]Really?
[75:28.82]You're gonna fucking lock me in here?
[75:32.95]Didn't I already kill this thing?
[75:34.95]I already killed the monster that's in the temple.
[75:40.81]Alright, I get it.
[75:41.47]That's really cool.
[75:42.09]So you can either heal...
[75:47.44]You heal or use.
[75:48.92]That's cool.
[75:50.06]It's like mana.
[75:51.78]You just have mana.
[76:00.71]I'm assuming there'll be more things to do with that mana bar.
[76:08.09]But I really like the fact that it's not like an Estus Flask.
[76:12.02]And it's not based around like having to carry like healing items.
[76:20.13]That takes you away from having to worry so much about, oh my god, I have to have like, how many healing herbs do I have right now?
[76:26.42]Four?
[76:27.04]Is that enough?
[76:27.58]It's like, you're always going to have enough.
[76:32.36]And that's good.
[76:36.25]That is a good feature.
[76:37.17]Where the hell am I?
[76:50.89]Oh!
[76:52.95]Damn it.
[76:55.61]I fell.
[77:03.44]The platforming so far is very clean, very fun.
[77:07.08]Very cleansed.
[77:10.35]You're gonna see me play this game.
[77:11.93]I'm gonna play this game more.
[77:20.20]Uh, what's down there?
[77:21.90]Oh, there's big boy.
[77:22.62]But let me open this and see what's over here.
[77:31.48]Still not entirely sure what those, like, actually do.
[77:36.24]But there is a lot of money up there, so we're gonna get it.
[77:38.16]Shit.
[77:45.42]Thought I hit him.
[77:52.03]And I think there's a ton of bosses in this game as well.
[77:55.17]That first one we just fought is one of, like, more than 20, I think.
[78:07.89]Oh, one of those.
[78:08.44]What do these things do again?
[78:10.76]I don't remember.
[78:12.18]Something comes out of this.
[78:14.22]What the fuck comes out of this?
[78:15.64]Oh, the gooey shit.
[78:18.54]The spirit hearts.
[78:19.64]Fuck, I probably shouldn't have done that.
[78:23.20]I gotta remember that for next time.
[78:25.08]Damn it.
[78:25.64]Oh well.
[78:27.48]Because I could really use that probably at a certain boss fight.
[78:29.76]And I just used it.
[78:32.67]Shit.
[78:33.09]Oh well.
[78:35.03]Alright, let's kill this dumb thing.
[78:41.95]Okay, thank god.
[78:45.17]I was gonna say, how do I shoot him again?
[78:54.42]Something here.
[78:55.62]Soul Catcher.
[78:58.76]Oh, they respawn.
[78:59.44]Okay.
[79:02.60]Soul Catcher.
[79:03.32]What is that?
[79:08.90]Ooh.
[79:11.50]Used by shamans to draw more soul from the world around them.
[79:14.26]Increases the amount of soul gained when striking an enemy with a nail.
[79:19.76]So that's just straight-up upgrade.
[79:22.00]I mean, why not?
[79:23.18]That thing's insane.
[79:25.52]Let's take a look down here.
[79:29.52]What do you want me to do?
[79:31.27]Oh, okay.
[79:33.19]I just have to kill that thing.
[79:38.41]Hey, thanks.
[79:38.93]Oh, look, the gate between us is open.
[79:41.19]I'm sure you're eager to move on.
[79:42.23]Farewell, have faith.
[79:43.03]Whatever you're seeking, it will find you.
[79:44.39]Ho, ho, ho.
[79:44.93]Okay.
[79:46.13]When on in, man.
[79:49.70]Let's get out of the rest of the bench and put that on.
[79:56.90]That's just... I only have two charms and this is a 100% upgrade.
[80:00.16]So, cool.
[80:02.82]Map updated as well, right?
[80:05.38]Alright, where... Where was that guy standing in front of the... That weird beetle that I can shoot with the fireballs now?
[80:15.35]I don't remember.
[80:18.27]But I'm going to go this way.
[80:31.70]And a lever.
[80:32.20]I already pressed it.
[80:38.34]Somebody says, sorry I missed you.
[80:39.48]If you're feeling lost, why not pop up to our store in Dirtmouth and purchase a map of this area?
[80:42.84]Available now for an excellent price.
[80:46.22]Don't I already have a map of this area?
[80:50.10]Well, I'm gonna go buy one.
[80:55.10]There's the left-hand side of the map.
[80:56.27]Oh yeah, I'll just take a look.
[80:57.25]But I'm gonna buy a map.
[81:01.61]Just because I feel like I just need to have one, should have one.
[81:09.62]A map of this area.
[81:15.42]Hey.
[81:17.24]Hey!
[81:19.29]I was born in Dirtmouth?
[81:23.21]I heard it's really nice this time of year.
[81:26.41]Alright, Dirtmouth!
[81:37.24]Let's go buy a map of that new spot.
[81:40.94]I already have this map, but why did he tell me to do it if I already have it?
[81:45.74]Well, why did I buy some of this stuff?
[81:47.36]Benchpin.
[81:52.26]Oh, blue cocoons.
[81:54.62]Should I just buy up the whole store?
[81:55.81]I could buy everything, right?
[81:59.81]I'm assuming I'm gonna need to have these at some point, right?
[82:03.21]Why not just... I'm just gonna buy them.
[82:04.47]What's the worst that could happen?
[82:05.26]Bench pin.
[82:05.74]Like, just have them.
[82:08.82]Why not?
[82:13.64]Vendor pin...
[82:19.42]We're talking comedy?
[82:21.02]Is it... Should I not just purchase the whole store?
[82:27.18]Is there any downside to buying everything?
[82:29.69]Because, I mean, I have the money.
[82:34.93]They're all worth buying?
[82:36.91]I'm just going to buy them.
[82:38.03]Just buy them all.
[82:40.45]I can always get more money and I can afford it and just... These are very basic things to have.
[82:48.17]So, nothing left for me to buy from you.
[82:54.08]Cleaned out the star.
[82:55.24]Okay.
[82:58.08]Cleaned out the star.
[83:02.59]I'll go sit on the bench.
[83:03.35]I guess just to heal up.
[83:10.31]You don't need it, but it's super useful.
[83:11.80]Downside, of course, that you might need the money later.
[83:15.76]I'd rather know where I'm going and know exactly where things are.
[83:18.66]If I'm completely honest.
[83:26.34]Yeah, this is better for me.
[83:28.93]I like that better.
[83:29.63]Just so I can see exactly where things are and where I'm going.
[83:34.53]I won't get lost.
[83:38.05]Alright, let's go lower left, I think, is where I need to be.
[83:39.85]Right.
[83:40.64]Right.
[83:41.76]Right.
[83:45.30]Don't forget to put the charm on.
[83:46.20]I have the charm on already.
[83:47.66]Charm is on.
[83:53.94]Alright, where was that?
[83:55.14]Over here?
[83:55.92]Yeah.
[83:59.85]Alright, let's fight the beetle!
[84:05.57]Now spit out a guy for me to swing at.
[84:08.21]Like that.
[84:08.65]Ow.
[84:17.37]Well, they got just like air shot me.
[84:18.77]Okay.
[84:19.19]Well, whatever.
[84:19.65]It's done.
[84:22.19]Poison gas.
[84:24.27]Be careful.
[84:28.13]Hey, what is this watchable game?
[84:29.41]Why isn't Jerma playing something super boring?
[84:31.33]I don't know, man.
[84:37.51]This is a play... This is an actually play video game stream, you know?
[84:43.16]Sometimes we don't play the video game, and sometimes the video game just sucks, and there's nothing else to do but, like, make dumb jokes.
[84:49.62]But you are currently, as of right now, watching a play video game stream.
[84:55.29]You know?
[84:56.27]Think about that.
[85:03.39]Green path.
[85:04.73]New area.
[85:11.24]Let's do some exploring.
[85:12.18]Make sure we don't miss anything.
[85:13.36]Weird flying insects.
[85:18.20]Bush person.
[85:25.16]Pretty area.
[85:25.82]I like it so far.
[85:29.43]Stink bug.
[85:33.21]Ooh, okay.
[85:33.87]He just explodes.
[85:35.37]Three hits.
[85:37.47]Good to know.
[85:42.60]Can I heal to full?
[85:43.32]No.
[85:47.19]What happened to Lego world?
[85:50.01]Nothing really.
[85:50.57]I just kind of did... I did what I needed to do.
[85:54.69]I'm going to go back.
[86:00.61]I want to look around over here.
[86:02.62]Kind of just speeding through this.
[86:03.96]Wow, that was lucky.
[86:09.60]Okay, down here.
[86:17.02]No!
[86:22.75]No.
[86:23.71]I don't like how when you hit them, like, if you jump and you hit, you bounce backwards.
[86:32.55]Anything else down here?
[86:36.95]Down this way, lower right.
[86:40.02]Well, I can go this way.
[86:46.12]That's where I came from.
[86:49.12]Fucking bush bug.
[86:51.52]Oh, let's just go.
[86:51.98]To the left.
[86:53.34]Move, move, move.
[86:57.62]I thought there might be an area to go down, but, you know, that's all good.
[87:04.35]I like being able to look as well.
[87:06.49]Thank you for giving me the look feature.
[87:13.61]And he explodes.
[87:14.31]Right, okay.
[87:16.41]Beer.
[87:17.55]Beer, I know.
[87:18.35]Beer.
[87:20.31]Easy.
[87:26.84]Go up.
[87:27.82]Go down.
[87:29.84]Secret!
[87:30.34]Secret!
[87:31.14]Secret!
[87:32.14]Secret!
[87:39.28]Nobody's found this yet.
[87:41.36]I'm the only one that found that.
[87:44.89]Found the secret.
[87:56.55]Down?
[87:57.17]Yeah, I can only go this way.
[88:00.71]Secret, secret, secret!
[88:02.49]Yeah, that was a secret.
[88:04.04]Gave me a bunch of money.
[88:04.70]Here's a new bench.
[88:12.14]Very cool.
[88:13.22]Map updated.
[88:17.68]I don't have a map of this area.
[88:19.32]Oh, shit.
[88:21.66]Oh, that's like super shit.
[88:29.35]That's like a... That's a big shit.
[88:35.27]That's a real big shit.
[88:36.33]Hopefully I can buy one.
[88:40.61]Whatever.
[88:43.41]I've killed more plants than animals.
[88:45.42]Or people.
[88:54.96]Can't really go up there.
[88:57.03]Well, alright.
[89:00.71]There's no jumping to that.
[89:06.99]Guess we're just going down.
[89:09.61]Down, down, down.
[89:12.98]I fucking hate you.
[89:14.62]No, don't do it again.
[89:15.68]Wait.
[89:16.30]Don't.
[89:19.30]Jesus, man.
[89:20.08]Slow down.
[89:24.45]I just felt my whole body tense up and explode there.
[89:27.29]Alright, we're fine.
[89:32.91]Where did I go?
[89:41.46]I had it.
[89:41.94]I know, I panicked.
[89:44.26]You guys have panicked before in video games, haven't you?
[89:49.51]Watch out for his exploding head.
[89:57.92]Is there nowhere to go here?
[90:02.06]I have to go that way.
[90:06.76]Fuck.
[90:07.65]I don't think I can make that jump.
[90:11.55]There's nowhere else to go besides, like, down this way.
[90:14.87]Top left is the only place to go.
[90:17.08]Shit.
[90:17.42]Okay, well.
[90:17.90]Let's go over here.
[90:25.87]Dive out.
[90:26.49]Dive, dive, dive.
[90:27.15]Ooh, you're fast.
[90:28.61]Faster than I thought.
[90:37.45]Um... Shit.
[90:44.47]Hey, Dr. Plato!
[90:46.25]Jerma, you're the best streaming on this website.
[90:47.97]Hope you feel better and your stream goes well today.
[90:51.67]Well, thank you.
[90:52.63]Thank you, doctor.
[90:54.18]Thank you.
[90:56.45]Dr. Plato.
[90:58.15]Appreciate the five bucks, man.
[91:00.97]Thank you so much.
[91:03.14]What the fuck am I doing right now?
[91:08.36]Can I not even get back here?
[91:11.96]I don't think I can even get back that way.
[91:13.08]I think I'm stuck here forever.
[91:18.23]Unless there's another way to go up.
[91:20.55]Oh!
[91:22.35]Right.
[91:22.91]Okay.
[91:23.49]Well, there's that.
[91:28.44]Just explore down here.
[91:29.48]I would need a map so bad.
[91:30.66]I came from over there.
[91:33.38]Let's go this way.
[91:34.40]Am I going to stream more Monster Hunter?
[91:42.69]Not in the future, no.
[91:44.53]Not in the near future.
[91:45.79]If they make a new one, yes.
[91:49.23]If Nintendo makes one for the Switch, you bet your ass I'm going to play that all the time.
[91:55.68]Really?
[91:55.94]Come on.
[92:01.68]I can't just whack that down?
[92:02.72]That's kind of bullshit.
[92:13.39]Can't just drop that?
[92:24.05]Die.
[92:24.25]Okay.
[92:25.33]R.I.P.
[92:25.69]Monster Hunter?
[92:28.30]I mean, not really.
[92:29.88]Just R.I.P.
[92:30.88]Monster...
[92:33.66]I hear him.
[92:34.44]There he is, this map guy.
[92:36.04]Please give me a map, dude.
[92:41.76]Yeah, chart the area.
[92:45.48]Purchase map, yes.
[92:48.38]Thank you.
[92:49.10]Ran into another traveler as I made my way down here.
[92:52.04]I tried to call out to her as she dashed, yeah.
[92:56.57]I saw her too.
[92:57.17]She's in the top left.
[92:59.65]Alright.
[93:00.85]Thank God.
[93:01.37]Now I can actually see what the fuck I'm doing.
[93:04.05]Thank you, by the way.
[93:04.65]Anything else you need to tell me?
[93:05.75]No.
[93:06.41]Of course not.
[93:13.17]Can't go that way.
[93:15.07]We need to go down and to the right.
[93:19.25]Down to the right.
[93:23.09]That's going to be harder than I think.
[93:24.29]Because I don't think I can make that.
[93:28.99]No, looks like... This poor guy.
[93:38.55]This guy is gonna just be getting crushed for eternity.
[93:42.91]Sorry.
[93:43.63]I didn't mean to do that to you.
[93:45.43]Except I did.
[93:46.05]There's no way for me to get up there.
[93:49.98]Wait till I get my fucking double jump, maybe.
[93:54.84]So we can't go that way.
[93:55.72]We just gotta go down to the left.
[94:06.23]Can I even go down?
[94:09.61]Fuck.
[94:12.13]I don't think I can even go down.
[94:19.13]Fuck me.
[94:19.67]I don't think I would.
[94:20.47]I can't really go anywhere.
[94:22.22]No.
[94:22.38]Hmm.
[94:39.98]I mean, all I can think of is cutting that and being able to jump over this way.
[94:44.38]I'm going back over here.
[94:59.94]Whoa!
[95:04.22]Oh!
[95:07.00]We're good.
[95:07.68]Oh, we good.
[95:12.27]Nice, okay.
[95:13.81]I'm gonna cut this one too.
[95:15.83]Just for fun.
[95:22.92]Now this is just straightforward.
[95:24.48]Hey, come on, I was looking at the map.
[95:26.64]That wasn't fair.
[95:28.72]Watch out for the explosion!
[95:36.49]Oh, you don't explode.
[95:37.15]Let's try right.
[95:44.06]We can cut that.
[95:44.85]Don't need to do that yet.
[95:46.11]What's over here?
[95:53.17]New NPC.
[95:53.99]New spell.
[95:54.57]New ability.
[95:55.15]New thing.
[95:55.83]New... New scary monster.
[96:01.16]Monster over here.
[96:06.40]Alright, it's the Fenrir voice.
[96:08.70]You approach fearless.
[96:09.54]Are you a hunter like me?
[96:11.60]Do you feel the urge inside to stalk, to kill, to understand?
[96:14.14]Then take it.
[96:14.70]My journal will aid you.
[96:15.96]At first, the text may seem difficult to discern, but a learned hunter will come to understand its words.
[96:20.45]Venture the depths of this land and slay its beasts.
[96:22.27]Prove yourself worthy to bear the mark of hunter.
[96:26.43]Please eat my shit.
[96:28.21]Sure thing.
[96:31.58]The Hunter's Journal.
[96:34.23]Oh, navigate the journal pane.
[96:35.29]Defeat enemies to add new entries.
[96:36.55]It's just a bestiary.
[96:37.99]Okay.
[96:40.13]Thanks.
[96:42.10]Uh-huh.
[96:45.18]Yup, yup, yup.
[96:45.86]Anything else?
[96:48.44]Thank you for the bestiary!
[96:54.18]Might as well just look at it so it leaves me alone.
[96:56.74]Yeah, here we are.
[96:58.76]Just teaches you about enemies.
[97:03.24]Cool.
[97:04.77]Does Blue Man have a sidekick?
[97:09.73]No, not yet.
[97:10.19]Blue Man does not have a sidekick.
[97:14.89]But one day he will, because every superhero has to have one sidekick.
[97:20.27]Let me see, where am I going?
[97:24.01]Left, but I'm gonna go right first.
[97:27.35]There's a caterpillar over here!
[97:28.43]Hello!
[97:35.49]Done with that.
[97:36.85]Watch out for these dive bombers.
[97:41.09]I'll do it again.
[97:42.41]Just peruse this area.
[97:49.54]Spikes.
[97:50.66]Anything else that I don't want to miss?
[97:55.72]Any money?
[97:56.32]Any money veins?
[97:57.74]Oh, there's one of these.
[98:00.60]Really?
[98:01.94]Get out of here.
[98:07.09]Just fills you up.
[98:07.91]Okay.
[98:10.05]Oh, there's a money vein.
[98:14.21]Kinda lost like 50% of that shit, but whatever.
[98:20.68]Keep moving.
[98:32.88]I can't wait for that person to teach me how to dash.
[98:37.89]New journal entry.
[98:39.63]This is fucking fun, man.
[98:41.81]I like this.
[98:42.89]This is fun.
[98:45.87]You can't tell me this game made fun.
[98:47.23]Like, I will argue you.
[98:49.29]I will argue your face.
[98:52.65]Secret!
[98:55.07]Those who stray from the White King... Hold on.
[98:57.55]There's a fucking piece of shit following me right now.
[99:02.78]Those who stray from the White King's roads shall face the law of Unn.
[99:10.56]It was destroyed from the Vikings roads.
[99:14.08]I don't know what that means.
[99:14.84]It means something.
[99:17.69]Who knows?
[99:20.45]Go down.
[99:21.07]Should I try just going down?
[99:27.47]We need an update.
[99:31.21]We need an update.
[99:32.41]What is this?
[99:34.20]Oh, there we go.
[99:35.02]Speaking of updates.
[99:39.38]That's all that's in here?
[99:40.16]Just a bench?
[99:43.44]Cool.
[99:46.68]Well, thanks for the rest.
[99:47.40]Blue Man's sidekick is a horse?
[99:54.05]What?
[99:55.69]A horse.
[99:57.69]I don't think that's necessarily true.
[100:00.99]You, my friend, need to stop doing that.
[100:03.06]Because you're really causing me stress.
[100:05.34]I'm not quite down enough.
[100:17.17]And this is... Dark.
[100:20.27]I don't like this.
[100:20.91]I don't like the dark areas.
[100:23.64]I'm just gonna fire randomly.
[100:29.08]Who gives a shit, right?
[100:29.94]I'll end up killing them all.
[100:32.56]By accident.
[100:36.79]Wow!
[100:37.29]Okay, that was close.
[100:39.67]Do it again.
[100:45.68]New NPC zone or something?
[100:53.63]Oh, shit.
[100:57.27]Should I?
[100:58.03]Oh, easy, easy.
[100:59.75]No, I can't see.
[101:06.80]Okay.
[101:07.66]Well, we're doing this in the dark.
[101:18.47]Nah, I can't.
[101:20.19]I can't.
[101:20.87]I'll come back.
[101:22.97]There's no way.
[101:23.73]I ain't gonna just kill myself a thousand times.
[101:26.10]No.
[101:27.06]Just gotta remember what that is.
[101:28.02]It's just over here on the right.
[101:29.30]The dark area.
[101:30.28]There was a really dark area in the first zone, too.
[101:33.46]That I can't forget about.
[101:35.16]This is one of those games that you will forget about the little secret things that you could've done.
[101:45.89]I gotta sense darkness.
[101:48.45]I had an opportunity to.
[101:53.99]Can't go up there yet.
[101:55.05]I don't have the dash that that person's gonna teach me, but I do... ...have you here.
[102:03.39]And I'm gonna guess this is what I have to do.
[102:06.12]And I was correct.
[102:07.42]I was correct.
[102:09.22]Sometimes you're not correct, but other times you are very correct.
[102:17.98]Down to the bubble pop room.
[102:19.07]Alright, while we're still, go down.
[102:23.79]Oh dear.
[102:24.91]Fog Canyon.
[102:26.83]New- I'm in a new zone.
[102:32.19]Hmm.
[102:34.26]What the- Jesus!
[102:37.82]Those guys shoot missiles at you when they die.
[102:47.30]Not supposed to be here.
[102:52.49]But here's the guy with the maps, so might as well.
[102:56.47]See what I'm talking about?
[102:57.37]See what I'm talking about?
[102:58.37]When you hit somebody, it pushes you backwards.
[103:01.41]I don't like that.
[103:04.76]Watch out for the fucking gigantic explosion.
[103:07.80]What's it doing?
[103:09.32]Why is this a blue shell from Mario Kart?
[103:11.28]That's not fucking fair.
[103:15.64]Come on, seriously.
[103:19.88]I can't go through this.
[103:21.34]I need like an umbrella.
[103:31.33]I guess I can't do this yet.
[103:35.01]Okay.
[103:35.39]I need a bile umbrella to go over there.
[103:45.69]Gear check.
[103:48.06]Well, I'm going back up.
[103:49.00]I obviously can't do anything here.
[103:50.06]I'm going to go with one more attempt to come down.
[103:54.22]Let's see.
[103:59.40]Is there a penalty for dying?
[104:00.22]There doesn't seem to be a penalty for dying.
[104:04.06]So, I think it's all good, but this is not smart.
[104:08.64]I need to get out of here.
[104:09.54]This is not a smart thing to do.
[104:14.27]It's pointing me down this way.
[104:15.41]I shouldn't be doing this at all.
[104:17.81]This is just not smart.
[104:23.80]This is an area that I don't need to be in right now.
[104:25.96]I'm just getting bombs dropped on me.
[104:32.44]My curiosity is seriously taking hold of me right now.
[104:35.96]I don't know what this is, but we're going over here.
[104:42.69]What is this?
[104:44.64]A store.
[104:45.00]Hello there, dearie.
[104:48.43]The banker.
[104:50.93]Banking services?
[104:52.91]Losing one's geo is a terrible thing and it's so much more likely if you carry it about on yourself.
[104:56.47]My vault is more secure and all my time as a banker.
[104:59.59]I've never lost a single geo.
[105:04.98]Open an account.
[105:07.96]I'm going to open up a bank account.
[105:13.41]What does that do?
[105:19.60]You're a smart one.
[105:20.16]Next time some dreadful bestie or beastie gets the best of you, you'll be glad to know your geo's safe within my shell or my vault.
[105:26.80]Now let's do some banking.
[105:28.92]Deposit.
[105:31.32]Oh!
[105:35.29]Okay.
[105:36.61]So if you die, you lose all your money.
[105:41.33]Got it.
[105:42.81]Okay, cool.
[105:45.45]Got it.
[105:47.39]That's cool.
[105:48.39]So... I guess just... I'm gonna die and forget where the fuck she is.
[105:59.00]So there's your death penalty, right?
[106:01.86]Your penalty for dying is that.
[106:06.86]So... Whatever.
[106:08.96]There's something else over here.
[106:11.13]Whatever this is.
[106:16.80]Queen's Station.
[106:21.24]This huge stag station up to that foggy descent.
[106:23.77]The bugs of hollowness must have been an impressive law at building such grand structures.
[106:29.73]Perfect place for a quick rest.
[106:32.17]Can you imagine this place in its time?
[106:33.79]Hordes of bugs traveling about the kingdom.
[106:35.22]So what, this is like the hub on a fast travel world?
[106:41.56]Special thing that's supposed to cherish these sites even in their decay.
[106:43.68]Hmm.
[106:46.46]I can still hear the echo.
[106:51.24]Do I have to spruce this place up?
[106:55.62]I'm going to assume this unlocks eventually.
[107:00.36]Turns into a hub.
[107:05.65]I'm getting so lost.
[107:08.55]I guess I don't have the super meat boy ability.
[107:10.13]I can't do a wall jump, but there's a secret over there, so don't forget that.
[107:17.31]Okay.
[107:18.01]Hm.
[107:22.89]Well, this is a place to rest.
[107:27.17]Is that an elevator?
[107:29.31]Well, let's rest here.
[107:30.03]I don't have an, uh, area.
[107:35.43]Inspect this.
[107:37.01]A toll machine with the symbol of a stag.
[107:38.84]Insert geo.
[107:39.64]120?
[107:39.66]What the fuck are you talking about? 120?
[107:47.74]Does that just take me back to the surface?
[107:49.12]I have no idea.
[107:50.48]That's too much money.
[107:51.22]I don't have that.
[107:52.86]Alright, let's just go.
[107:56.60]Let's get back up.
[108:00.58]What the fuck is this?
[108:04.62]There's so many characters in this game.
[108:07.45]Come in search of treats.
[108:08.41]Okay.
[108:13.39]This place must have once been quite the hub.
[108:15.37]That's what I said.
[108:17.96]Neither place seems particularly welcoming, so while my little treats last, I think they'll stay right here.
[108:23.63]Could we stop by any time?
[108:24.53]Though I do like the quiet in this station.
[108:26.21]A little company is always good for one's health.
[108:30.23]What treats?
[108:35.12]She's got like little treats above her, apparently, or something?
[108:41.30]Oh, she's standing.
[108:43.56]She's standing up and eating.
[108:46.00]But I'm not tall enough to do the same thing.
[108:48.31]I'm not tall enough.
[108:57.91]Oh well.
[109:00.53]It's all good.
[109:04.13]Although that is right here, right?
[109:07.55]She's eating from here.
[109:08.72]Okay, whatever.
[109:10.26]Let's go back to the actual game.
[109:15.35]Small hero.
[109:16.53]Yeah, I know.
[109:17.45]Just like in real life.
[109:18.85]Just like in real life.
[109:20.99]Well, there's the bank.
[109:21.69]Should I take the money out of the bank and go do the elevator?
[109:23.67]Just see what it does.
[109:24.25]We're gonna see what it does.
[109:25.03]I'm gonna do it.
[109:28.51]Give me my money back.
[109:29.54]Let's just pay for it.
[109:30.28]Hopefully it just unlocks it.
[109:38.06]Give me the money.
[109:38.60]About to throw money down the fucking drain.
[109:45.67]Let's go.
[109:50.13]Money in the bank match.
[109:50.95]Yeah, I gotta climb the ladder.
[109:57.67]Compact aggravated streamer starves.
[110:00.39]What?
[110:01.13]What are you talking about?
[110:07.05]Collect the interest.
[110:07.83]Alright, let's put the money in.
[110:09.67]120. 120.
[110:14.07]Alright.
[110:17.00]This thing is not functioning, I guess.
[110:20.39]Just call the bell?
[110:21.55]Yep.
[110:25.62]Whoa!
[110:27.00]Oh, that's cool.
[110:29.50]Greetings, little one.
[110:30.04]It's been an age since I last heard the ringing of a station bell that echoed down the stagways and called me to you.
[110:34.58]I've grown stiff and tired over these many years and I've forgotten much, but the sound of the bell will always call me back.
[110:39.68]These stagways stretch to the depths of Hallownest.
[110:41.90]If you want me to travel them, hail me from the platform.
[110:43.68]I will take you where you need to go.
[110:46.38]Oh.
[110:47.70]Wow, that's... That is very useful.
[110:57.56]I like how everybody's a bug.
[110:58.50]And that brings us here.
[111:02.14]But where is here?
[111:05.30]Where the hell is that?
[111:08.01]Elevator.
[111:10.61]Ah.
[111:12.41]Ooh.
[111:13.99]This is that door that's all the way over here, right?
[111:16.31]Yep.
[111:19.25]Nice.
[111:19.51]Okay, I'm very happy about that.
[111:23.44]Very happy.
[111:24.02]Let's rest.
[111:24.66]Rest.
[111:30.14]Go T-Bug, have anything else to say?
[111:31.62]What does Go T-Bug have to tell me now?
[111:38.84]Yeah, he just said, thanks for opening the station.
[111:42.72]Alright, back down to where we were.
[111:45.92]See if we can't get to, like, the second boss.
[111:51.97]Which we need to go... Hmm, green paths down here.
[112:03.15]Green path.
[112:12.80]Go down.
[112:16.92]Here.
[112:20.86]Style looks good.
[112:22.58]Yeah, this is very, very, very, very fun.
[112:24.67]Very, very interesting game so far.
[112:26.13]I am intrigued.
[112:29.03]I'm into it.
[112:32.92]And it's been pretty good so far.
[112:35.64]I don't really have any real major complaints about the game.
[112:43.97]Seems to be paced pretty well as well.
[112:50.46]Pretty bad.
[112:50.86]Alright, let's make sure I'm going the right way because I don't want to miss anything.
[112:57.38]I can't really do much unless I figure out how to get up to that spot.
[113:01.12]So let's just go over here and make sure I don't miss anything.
[113:03.92]And I mean anything.
[113:12.55]Right.
[113:17.17]Replenish.
[113:19.47]Your first playthrough of this game was 30 hours.
[113:21.59]Really?
[113:21.95]Damn.
[113:23.15]Holy shit.
[113:25.11]That's a long time.
[113:28.62]This game is long then, huh?
[113:31.66]That's really cool.
[113:34.54]Well, I'm looking forward to playing it.
[113:37.10]As long as I can keep up with it, right?
[113:44.31]Let's think about this here.
[113:45.39]Over this way... There was a little secret over here, from what I remember.
[113:51.39]Come on, open.
[113:53.84]Open your mouth!
[113:57.49]Wait, what?
[113:59.31]30 hours for even coming.
[114:00.47]No.
[114:01.21]No way.
[114:07.18]There's only one way to go.
[114:12.54]You're buying this?
[114:13.06]Thanks for the introduction.
[114:13.98]Yeah, my pleasure.
[114:15.92]I hope you have as much fun as I am having right now.
[114:20.31]Just wish I wasn't sick.
[114:24.45]More puff.
[114:27.29]Here's the thing to rest at, we'll do that.
[114:31.12]Anything else up?
[114:32.02]No.
[114:32.40]I gotta figure out how to move forward.
[114:46.65]Can I cut something here?
[114:48.97]No.
[114:51.25]So I can't go that way.
[114:53.09]So we have to keep going down.
[114:55.57]Just not all the way down.
[114:57.01]So down, down, down, down, down.
[115:01.25]Just don't land in the acid like you did last time.
[115:05.33]That'll take us to here.
[115:11.00]Yep.
[115:18.48]I have never played Ori and the Blind Forest, although I've heard many, many fantastic things about it.
[115:25.85]I think I like games like that, but this is one of those... I mean, is Ori and the Blind Forest like this?
[115:35.71]Or is it more of a story kind of action platformer game?
[115:44.43]Wait, what?
[115:46.20]Because to me, this is one of those almost like Salt and Sanctuary-like games where there's like a bunch of bosses, you have to explore, and it's, you know, difficult.
[115:56.95]Is Ori and the Blind Forest like a difficult game?
[116:00.61]It's very similar.
[116:01.21]Maybe I should play it then.
[116:02.23]Alright, we're going left.
[116:05.85]I'm going to try to go left.
[116:07.97]Wow, he just darted right into me, huh?
[116:15.87]It's faster paced than this game.
[116:16.91]Yeah, this game is a little bit slower.
[116:21.15]But that's okay.
[116:22.69]It's still fun.
[116:23.53]Alright, we're going left.
[116:27.59]More platforming.
[116:28.33]Yeah, everything I've seen of Ori and the Blind Forest is Ori just dashing around.
[116:32.93]Darting around corners and stuff.
[116:34.47]Come on, really?
[116:37.99]Don't do that to me.
[116:42.88]Alright, down.
[116:43.54]Let's try going left.
[116:44.51]I think this was not trackable, but... Let's see.
[116:53.05]I guess it is.
[117:01.09]No!
[117:02.41]No!
[117:02.93]These guys drop a lot of money, though.
[117:07.09]So it's worth killing them.
[117:09.49]What am I gonna do?
[117:09.99]Garry the Gull?
[117:14.43]I beat the entire Gary the Gull video game.
[117:19.11]Alright, so we've not been here yet.
[117:21.01]Good.
[117:25.54]Whoa!
[117:27.26]Watch out for little Chub.
[117:28.42]Oh, okay.
[117:31.94]Well, he's gonna get the dust off of him.
[117:43.83]The difficulty ramps up very quickly.
[117:46.06]I could see that.
[117:48.00]Once they give you a lot of the basic shit to play with and the basic things to do, I can see this game getting very, very, very hard real quickly.
[117:59.54]But that's fine.
[118:00.18]I'm okay with that.
[118:02.94]I'm very much okay with that.
[118:08.46]There she is again.
[118:09.10]I'm just going to follow her.
[118:10.14]Wait, not follow her.
[118:11.00]There's an item right there.
[118:13.55]I can't get that item.
[118:14.83]Damn it.
[118:15.39]Oh well.
[118:18.03]Well, not so fast.
[118:18.89]Hold on.
[118:23.95]There is a place to go up here.
[118:28.60]Have I ever played... Cave Story is one of the first games I think I ever streamed.
[118:33.50]I played Cave Story on stream for a very long time, actually.
[118:40.37]You guys remember the old YouTube streams?
[118:43.29]Cave Story?
[118:48.22]I remember.
[118:58.32]Those were the days.
[119:02.84]The days of YouTube streaming.
[119:05.56]Holy shit, what a nightmare.
[119:07.03]What an awful piece of shit platform that was.
[119:12.32]Legit YouTube streaming was the fucking shittiest thing I may have ever done on any website Hospital sim I remember those two good times good times guys good times Secret secret secret
[119:40.81]Kinda can't see.
[119:42.23]You're in the wall.
[119:45.82]What was so bad about YouTube streaming?
[119:48.20]Everything.
[119:50.52]Think of something that could be wrong with a service for streaming, and it was wrong with YouTube streaming.
[119:56.87]Hasn't YouTube streaming gotten a lot better?
[119:58.53]Probably not.
[119:59.41]No.
[120:02.68]I would say, like, I'm gonna say not a chance.
[120:05.40]I'm not sure.
[120:06.10]Like, I remember seeing it, that they were doing, like, a new beta for it.
[120:10.00]And being like, huh, good luck.
[120:12.39]And apparently, the only good thing that YouTube streaming has is a higher, like, bitrate.
[120:18.87]Allowed.
[120:21.97]So you can stream at a higher quality on YouTube if your computer can, like, handle it and your internet can handle it.
[120:29.56]But I think that's pretty much it.
[120:34.10]And if you're wondering what I'm doing right now, I just want to be able to update the... I want to be able to traverse most of this so I can write it down in the journal.
[120:43.44]So I know where I'm going later.
[120:44.78]So now we're just going to go back.
[120:53.01]Right here.
[120:57.25]YouTube Gaming has some great features such as being able to rewind...
[121:01.84]Yeah, that is cool.
[121:02.84]It's kind of... Instead of it being a live broadcast, it's more of like a TiVo, right?
[121:08.59]You get to actually have... It's like you're watching a VOD instead of watching a YouTube stream or watching a Twitch stream.
[121:18.09]But the reason why you stream on Twitch is because not only is Twitch already like the established platform for broadcasting, the subscription features, the chat, the YouTube chat, YouTube streaming chat is still just fucking awful.
[121:33.52]It's still just fucking useless.
[121:35.98]It's like one of the most important things of live streaming on a website is like the chat feature.
[121:42.73]This shit sucks so bad on YouTube.
[121:48.01]Like, the whole reason to do a live broadcast.
[121:51.27]To, like, be able to see what people are saying in real time.
[121:53.64]And, like, engage in real time.
[121:55.98]And all the, like, different features that Twitch has.
[121:57.64]Like, YouTube's just... No.
[122:01.76]YouTube threw up in the bed, like, fucking three years ago.
[122:05.30]And they've never cleaned it.
[122:09.67]YouTube.com literally diarrhea-ed in the bed.
[122:14.29]And woke up.
[122:15.71]And realized that they shit the bed.
[122:17.93]And didn't even change their fucking underwear.
[122:24.25]You know, here's what YouTube did.
[122:25.55]YouTube shit the bed, shit their underwear, diarrhea their pants.
[122:29.78]And like, fucking bought a new house.
[122:33.50]And then brought the bed, didn't change their underwear, they brought the bed they shit in into the new house.
[122:38.56]They bought a new house to, like no, just change your underwear and change your sheets.
[122:43.26]Don't buy a new house.
[122:44.72]What the fuck are you talking about?
[122:47.23]oh no I shit my pants and shit the bed I gotta buy a new I gotta buy a new house don't just buy new underwear crazy who started me on the rent Etalyx going way off script here
[123:13.54]Alright, what is this thing?
[123:15.34]The greater mind wants to read with leaf and cast these caverns.
[123:17.64]So, in every bush and every vine.
[123:18.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[123:19.93]So, what do you want?
[123:21.01]What do you want me to do here?
[123:21.89]You keep giving me vague information.
[123:25.27]Why?
[123:25.49]Alright, let's see.
[123:29.33]I don't have this tracked out yet.
[123:30.95]Should I just go down?
[123:35.90]What am I talking about?
[123:36.64]That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[123:37.86]You guys should understand this.
[123:40.40]What is this?
[123:46.81]Oh!
[123:47.65]Final boss.
[123:48.83]I made it to the final boss.
[123:49.67]Alright, no fucking around.
[123:51.33]Okay, he can block.
[123:54.65]He swings.
[123:55.23]That's when you hit him.
[123:56.41]He swings his sword.
[124:00.19]Ooh, he hit me hard.
[124:01.44]Okay, I don't know why I did that.
[124:09.02]Let's heal here.
[124:12.04]Oh, and you can throw.
[124:12.74]You throw shit, too.
[124:17.43]Block.
[124:17.77]He's going to go forward.
[124:18.57]I'm not sure.
[124:19.55]One swing.
[124:22.47]Spits his damn shit out.
[124:24.45]Swing.
[124:24.89]Two hits.
[124:25.65]Got him.
[124:28.40]No big deal.
[124:29.76]Not a big deal.
[124:35.64]Actual Mothman.
[124:41.68]Yeah, my point I was making there with YouTube is... YouTube... YouTube had a bunch of problems, like, three years ago.
[124:50.10]With subscription issues, and, uh, problems with the feeds, and uploads, and processing.
[124:56.51]There was a ton of problems a few years ago, like two years ago on YouTube.
[125:00.03]And instead of, like, fixing the problems, instead of changing their underwear, they, like, redesigned the whole website.
[125:07.37]And the problems, they didn't change, they didn't fix the problems.
[125:13.34]They fucking just should have changed their underwear.
[125:15.20]Don't buy a new house.
[125:16.60]That's all I was trying to say.
[125:17.90]Oh, journal updated.
[125:21.82]Okay.
[125:24.04]So we're up here now.
[125:27.21]I really need to rest to update the map.
[125:29.65]Kind of getting a little lost at the moment.
[125:37.01]And people always ask me, and I've talked about this a couple times before, but we'll touch upon it again, like, oh, how come you don't do, like, why don't you make, like, a video?
[125:44.92]Like, why don't you make, like, videos?
[125:46.22]Do you make more videos?
[125:48.72]And, like, that's part of the problem, is YouTube just got really frustrating because of how they were dealing with the site.
[125:56.20]And I find this to be a more engaging platform at the moment, right?
[126:03.28]Let him go.
[126:10.12]Is that like a new... How do I like save this guy?
[126:13.50]Another boss.
[126:16.61]Shit, he's hard.
[126:18.19]He's hard.
[126:18.51]He has like the most predictable pattern in the game.
[126:20.59]He's fucking hard.
[126:21.37]Okay, I'm gonna shoot him.
[126:25.67]No, I'm gonna miss.
[126:30.44]Oh shit, he shoots little bugs at you.
[126:32.54]Wow, wow!
[126:33.94]Easy, slow down.
[126:41.61]I gotta go with it.
[126:42.99]Damn it.
[126:47.80]Come on.
[126:48.14]No, he's dead.
[126:56.73]Easy.
[127:00.21]You dropped a lot of shit.
[127:01.03]Let me get that first.
[127:04.77]Can I help that guy?
[127:06.23]Oh, he's alive.
[127:06.85]He's actually alive.
[127:08.04]Hold on.
[127:08.52]Hold on.
[127:08.80]Let me talk to this guy.
[127:13.33]Can I like...
[127:47.48]I feel like he'll appear later for some reason, right?
[127:53.97]I did rescue him.
[128:00.38]Getting fairly close to something over here.
[128:04.00]And by something, I have no idea what it is.
[128:12.03]But whatever it is... Oh, there's one of those knights.
[128:14.25]Look at all that money.
[128:15.25]Okay.
[128:16.67]We gotta play smart here.
[128:18.83]Fight Mr. Knight.
[128:27.82]Shit.
[128:28.36]He did two swings there.
[128:29.28]Come on.
[128:32.62]Come on, swing, buddy.
[128:33.38]Swing!
[128:35.20]Swing!
[128:40.10]You're really causing me a headache here.
[128:42.24]Just fucking kill him.
[128:43.68]What the f- What?
[128:44.80]Why?
[128:45.46]Hey!
[128:47.11]What is the- What is up with this?
[128:54.89]Come on.
[128:55.43]Like your fucking twin brother came out of the ground.
[129:10.18]Alright, don't respawn.
[129:11.18]There's so much money over here.
[129:16.33]Like, please don't have, like, a third one of you guys spawn.
[129:22.35]Game stat is good.
[129:23.11]Yeah, game status is good.
[129:24.27]It is.
[129:25.57]We got money.
[129:26.35]We got money to spend.
[129:29.31]Ugh, I need to go left.
[129:31.21]How in the... How in the F...
[129:52.63]Open?
[129:53.43]Alright.
[129:54.05]Got him.
[129:54.47]Saved him.
[129:56.17]The game is very fun.
[130:00.59]I could get lost here for a while, you know?
[130:07.52]Hmm, this way.
[130:10.38]Aye, aye, aye.
[130:16.42]Hmm.
[130:19.38]I wonder if this has...
[130:23.51]A bench.
[130:24.09]I hope it does.
[130:25.43]I hope it has a bench.
[130:36.76]This looks like part of the pub world, right?
[130:45.18]Um... Damn, dude.
[130:47.70]Where the hell am I?
[130:49.12]Where the fuck am I?
[130:53.70]Thank God, a bench.
[130:54.76]Oh, and a fast travel.
[130:56.06]Thank God.
[130:59.49]Alright.
[131:00.65]Beautiful.
[131:05.25]Let me see if I can get a compass for this place now.
[131:07.61]Because this is perfect.
[131:13.55]How was PAX?
[131:14.22]PAX was fun until I got really fucking sick.
[131:18.41]So we have the green path station, now let's go to Dirtmouth and let's see if I can buy a compass for this place.
[131:26.05]Or buy a map for this place.
[131:34.18]I'm happy to find that though.
[131:43.34]I didn't even get... It's not cold.
[131:45.44]It's not a cold.
[131:47.04]It's just straight up an illness.
[131:49.84]Oh, wait, there he is.
[131:50.42]Yeah, he's here.
[131:52.06]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[131:52.36]He keeps talking dribble over there.
[131:54.92]Seems to think the very air is deadly in the town, yeah.
[132:14.08]Dreams.
[132:14.58]Are you gonna give me something?
[132:15.52]Okay, well.
[132:20.86]Yeah, I'm re-establishing the railroad system.
[132:29.11]Stagway pin.
[132:32.75]Nothing for me besides a stagway pin?
[132:36.53]Well, I'm gonna get it.
[132:49.50]Well, um, I guess I already have the map for that whole area.
[132:54.96]I just needed to update it.
[132:55.82]Okay.
[132:56.32]Well, we're good.
[133:02.01]It's pronounced dingy, not dingy.
[133:04.27]No, it's dingy.
[133:06.67]It's a dingy little place.
[133:10.27]Thank God this doesn't cost any money.
[133:13.29]Yeah.
[133:16.21]Maybe I have a stomach ulcer?
[133:17.31]No, I have all kinds of stomach problems, my friend.
[133:20.67]Trust me.
[133:21.05]Alright.
[133:25.83]We're gonna go up to the left.
[133:33.97]That's the place to go.
[133:39.59]Oh, it's a dinghy.
[133:42.23]It's a goddamn dinghy.
[133:47.43]A dinghy is a boat.
[133:48.27]Yeah, a dinghy.
[133:50.29]It's really dinghy.
[133:52.81]And if you were talking, like, okay, if the temperature was really cold, what would you say?
[133:56.39]It's really dinghy outside.
[133:58.49]Alright, boss fight.
[134:10.60]Boss fight.
[134:12.00]Ooh, didn't think I was gonna do that shit, did ya?
[134:19.45]Alright, when she says, Shaw, that's when you dodge.
[134:32.40]Shit.
[134:32.90]What is she doing?
[134:36.62]Oh, boy.
[134:37.06]Alright, this is the opportunity to go hit her, but I need to heal.
[134:40.97]Shit.
[134:50.04]Fuck!
[134:51.36]Shit, that's my opportunity.
[134:54.73]Shit!
[135:17.46]Damn it!
[135:18.78]Got Grady.
[135:20.32]Shit!
[135:24.09]Easy.
[135:51.81]What the fuck?
[135:52.27]Right on the tip.
[135:52.85]Come on.
[135:53.15]Got her.
[135:54.93]Come on.
[135:55.73]Dead.
[136:03.29]I win.
[136:27.17]Boss down?
[136:29.41]I just beat Hornet.
[136:34.21]Moth wa- oh there it is, there's the dash.
[136:36.35]Right trigger to dash forward.
[136:42.64]The- ow.
[136:45.90]Would it seek to break the seals?
[136:47.30]They cannot be undone!
[136:48.23]They must not be undone!
[136:49.19]Let us sleep, little shadow.
[136:50.55]Return to your darkness.
[136:51.55]Allow us peace.
[136:52.69]Aye!
[136:58.49]She was just bored.
[137:05.09]Well, this guy's dead.
[137:07.71]This guy has his fucking skull crushed in.
[137:17.86]Where's my money?
[137:19.24]Don't you get a chest if you fight a boss?
[137:22.44]Does this cost anything, by the way?
[137:27.28]Doesn't look like it.
[137:28.14]Oh, hold on.
[137:35.75]Cool.
[137:39.79]Currently down here.
[137:40.85]There's only one way to go.
[137:46.02]But we're going to check this area.
[137:48.96]Okay.
[137:51.68]Broke that down.
[137:52.54]Don't know what the hell that's for, but I did it.
[137:57.12]Interesting.
[137:57.64]Okay.
[138:04.31]Should I go up?
[138:06.55]I mean, I guess I could go up.
[138:07.77]I could go up or I could keep going that way.
[138:17.46]Well, let's just do this.
[138:18.64]Just to see.
[138:19.10]Because this was the reason why I did this, right?
[138:23.47]In a way.
[138:23.79]Okay.
[138:26.47]How's the dash feel?
[138:28.33]Feels pretty clean.
[138:32.87]Yeah, feels actually really good.
[138:37.23]Can I not go up here before?
[138:38.19]I don't know.
[138:39.47]What the hell am I doing?
[138:42.29]I've lost all control.
[138:43.41]I feel like there was something I could do up here though, right?
[138:47.86]Wasn't there something I could do that I couldn't do before?
[138:49.56]Why does it look like I've never been this way?
[138:59.23]Is this the entrance?
[139:01.91]What the hell is this then?
[139:07.42]Don't have a map for this area.
[139:09.22]So yeah, I have not gone this way.
[139:11.84]That's not... No, this is... I ain't going this way.
[139:19.30]I just knew there was a spot I didn't go over here.
[139:23.37]I like that these things bark like little dogs.
[139:30.43]I'm like overusing the dash now.
[139:31.87]Let's go back.
[139:39.59]Give me that cash.
[139:49.00]Shit.
[139:49.92]Can I not dash and attack at the same time?
[139:53.02]I can't.
[139:53.42]Okay.
[139:54.26]Just checking.
[139:57.23]Was that a dinghy?
[139:57.75]Yeah, it was a little dinghy.
[140:01.43]Down down Okay, we're just gonna go all the way down Can move much faster though, that's good Down Well, ow
[140:29.17]Ow.
[140:30.06]Now I'm just trying to speed through this.
[140:32.98]So there's a place to go to the top left and the left.
[140:35.04]I could go down and to the left.
[140:38.24]Just keep going where I was going.
[140:39.50]I got this lot of shit to do in the first area.
[140:43.08]Yeah, there is.
[140:45.82]There is.
[140:47.21]But I kind of just want to progress through here.
[140:57.86]I want to progress this way.
[141:06.20]Diner dash.
[141:09.64]This is kind of a diner dash situation, isn't it?
[141:13.96]Meeting dinner and I'm dashing.
[141:17.79]And I mean that quite literally, like I'm dashing.
[141:23.33]Lake of Oon.
[141:28.45]let's go let's go in oon's house hi there oh is it okay well this guy's not oon can't hardly believe those dingy old highways led to such a lush and lively place this building suggests some sort of worship though its idol has clearly been long forgotten doubles equally well for a moment's respect
[141:54.73]Saw a strange fellow out there.
[141:55.69]He seemed quite taken by the lake.
[141:57.79]I had planned to offer greetings, though figured I'd first tend to my nail on chance our meeting goes poorly.
[142:04.78]Your nail looks like a fine instrument, but it's showing signs of wear.
[142:07.70]I'd wager up there it would take you far.
[142:09.88]Down here, however, I suspect you'll soon meet dangers of the surface.
[142:12.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[142:13.52]So I need a new weapon.
[142:19.93]Well, he's pretty much telling me my weapon sucks.
[142:24.29]That's fine.
[142:25.99]Wait, didn't I get a new charm?
[142:27.83]Or new something?
[142:29.09]No.
[142:32.11]I got a new thing, though, didn't I?
[142:33.63]No.
[142:40.08]Respite?
[142:40.48]Respite?
[142:41.04]Eh, whatever.
[142:41.46]I'm a fucking idiot.
[142:44.04]Hey!
[142:46.54]I thought I could talk to this guy!
[142:47.98]What?
[142:50.02]Well, fine.
[142:52.75]I thought I was gonna speak to him.
[142:55.09]Now he's got me all fucking messed up.
[143:06.04]And now all the shit went in the water.
[143:11.68]So what was the point of me doing that?
[143:17.25]I can dash, right?
[143:18.09]Should I dash?
[143:20.91]Okay, I killed this guy.
[143:21.81]What does he do?
[143:25.25]I did it.
[143:25.81]Now what?
[143:28.41]Really?
[143:32.86]Huh.
[143:38.20]Well, this... There's a flying bug right there.
[143:43.60]Can I, like, do something with a flying bug?
[143:49.84]I don't think I can do anything about this right now.
[143:55.65]I cannot dash more than once, I don't think.
[143:57.91]No.
[144:02.41]I guess I have to come back here later.
[144:04.04]Lake of Un.
[144:06.54]Oh well.
[144:10.54]Although I should rest up, don't I?
[144:15.27]Go to the one place I haven't gone.
[144:17.57]I just killed an NPC.
[144:18.89]Are you serious?
[144:23.99]When did I kill... That's not an NPC.
[144:26.53]Why did he try to... I wasn't supposed to do that?
[144:31.08]I was supposed to fight that guy?
[144:39.18]That is a special enemy?
[144:40.54]Oh, God.
[144:41.28]What have I done?
[144:41.82]Alright, we're going down.
[144:50.86]Actually, can I get this through here?
[144:58.59]Just an idle enemy, don't worry.
[145:02.09]Now you guys got me all worried!
[145:03.24]I can now not beat the game.
[145:09.46]That would be fucking hilarious if that were true.
[145:14.88]Hey, Dens is a talented swordsman.
[145:16.86]Thank you for your $14.
[145:20.20]They say, hey, Jerma, I've been through... I've been through a tough year.
[145:24.28]I think that's what he was saying there.
[145:25.58]But you've always been able to put a smile on my face.
[145:27.59]Keep it up.
[145:28.23]Well, Dens, thank you for the $14.
[145:30.45]I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
[145:33.13]Watching the stream, the videos.
[145:34.79]Thank you.
[145:36.50]And then Jerma's Hat Hair gave three bucks.
[145:39.16]It says, LOL, noises are cute.
[145:44.71]Cheer, cheer, cheer.
[145:46.71]Thank you.
[145:48.15]Also, Devin the Magic Dog, thank you as well.
[145:52.57]Let's keep going down.
[145:59.20]Straight down, right?
[146:01.24]Well, that almost killed me.
[146:06.20]It's gone full circle?
[146:07.32]What do you mean it's gone full circle?
[146:11.18]Shit.
[146:18.48]I like the button placement for everything, too.
[146:22.19]Feels very, very deliberate.
[146:26.29]There's the entrance, yeah.
[146:30.81]Feels like they developed that, you know?
[146:32.27]Feels like they actually made that.
[146:33.37]Video game!
[146:40.78]I wonder when I can buy my first weapon.
[146:44.00]I wonder.
[146:45.76]Laugh un-lound.
[146:48.98]Yeah, laugh un-loud.
[146:54.51]Just check over here.
[146:55.79]Another one of these vague things.
[146:59.71]For moss and leaf our life is drawn, while it grows upon the path we shall never wilt.
[147:03.45]Whatever you say.
[147:11.43]And... New spot.
[147:17.81]Well, I just fucked that up royally.
[147:19.57]I don't want you to drop.
[147:24.64]Yeah, hello.
[147:27.98]Well, time to dash.
[147:30.57]No, not time to dash.
[147:31.47]Now it's time to dash?
[147:35.05]Nope.
[147:37.98]Okay.
[147:39.30]I guess I don't go this way either.
[147:45.64]Oh, definitely not.
[147:47.02]No way.
[147:47.46]I need like Super Meat Boy ability.
[147:51.21]Can't go this way.
[147:52.11]So we're going to go back to the right.
[147:53.13]Okay.
[147:55.05]Okay.
[147:58.00]Hey, game sucks.
[147:58.92]Thanks for the $5.
[147:59.82]They say, love you.
[148:00.60]Well, thank you, game sucks.
[148:08.08]Nice.
[148:08.58]I know, right?
[148:12.88]But we actually have to go all the way back here.
[148:16.32]Yeah.
[148:17.61]All the way to the right.
[148:18.29]Make sure I don't miss any secrets.
[148:23.03]Secret.
[148:28.70]Uh, no secrets.
[148:29.89]Well, there's a secret.
[148:38.42]There's a secret.
[148:39.16]Nice, tasty secret.
[148:48.65]There was that spot over here that I could not get to, so I have to dash to it.
[148:52.89]And it's all the way to the right.
[148:54.19]You can see that left area.
[148:57.49]Let's do it!
[149:05.48]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[149:07.24]Just gotta go all the way across.
[149:09.64]No big deal.
[149:12.44]Found a nice little soukrette over here.
[149:20.93]Okay.
[149:25.17]Now, was that actually the second boss?
[149:27.74]Oh, no.
[149:29.76]Okay, now go here and down.
[149:32.20]Ow.
[149:35.10]Like, was that the second boss?
[149:38.21]Or was that the second, like, mini-boss?
[149:45.81]There we are.
[149:49.20]Alright.
[149:50.50]Over here, right, is where I couldn't get to before.
[149:53.39]I believe.
[149:57.89]I believe it's down here.
[150:06.07]I was correct.
[150:07.27]Okay.
[150:08.61]Now what?
[150:11.25]Hornet is the second boss.
[150:12.23]Okay, cool.
[150:18.06]No, I think the second... I think this is a boss.
[150:24.06]Nope.
[150:25.86]Oh!
[150:27.18]It's just a scary enemy.
[150:31.39]Easy enough, right?
[150:43.01]I'll just do that over and over again.
[150:52.79]There it is.
[150:55.86]Got it.
[150:59.12]OH SHIT!
[151:00.02]I didn't get it.
[151:00.50]It's gonna come back.
[151:01.10]Fuck, I did not expect that.
[151:03.22]At least I made it through the area.
[151:13.19]I've got a lot of money.
[151:17.93]What, a centipede ripoff?
[151:24.71]Are there other weapons in this game?
[151:26.15]Can I actually upgrade weapons and buy new weapons?
[151:28.89]It seems like there's a lot of shit in this game.
[151:30.43]I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface.
[151:34.54]Like, I've barely scratched this game's balls.
[151:36.36]You know what I mean?
[151:37.88]Barely.
[151:38.22]Is this area still this big?
[151:54.79]I wonder what else I'm missing from here.
[152:00.75]Is it all hand-drawn?
[152:01.41]This is all hand-drawn.
[152:02.37]The whole game.
[152:03.56]Everything.
[152:09.88]Everything.
[152:10.46]Ooh, chest.
[152:11.38]Big chest.
[152:13.01]I want that.
[152:13.77]I need that.
[152:25.64]That's gonna be a shitload of money in there.
[152:27.32]Oh, yes.
[152:35.06]We're getting full pockets here, guys.
[152:41.14]This game was a Kickstarter project, wasn't it?
[152:43.44]From what I can recall.
[152:53.14]Is this one of the Kickstarter success stories?
[152:58.75]What was that?
[153:00.19]Can't really get that, though.
[153:05.38]Zero deaths?
[153:06.72]Yeah, actually, I have not died one time.
[153:08.64]That is true.
[153:12.62]I don't think I can get over there.
[153:18.15]No.
[153:18.91]Not yet, at least.
[153:19.57]I think that's all I can do here.
[153:38.26]You jumped in the water?
[153:39.14]Well, I guess I've fallen in the water a couple times, that is right.
[153:43.22]But I have not gotten to, like, the you died screen.
[153:45.72]Because you just lose an Alienware computer if you do that.
[153:56.15]You don't actually lose, you just lose one of your computers.
[154:02.39]Is this anything?
[154:09.31]Okay.
[154:10.65]I guess it's time to go to the fog canyon?
[154:12.35]I don't think there's anything else I can do here.
[154:16.99]Fog canyon is the next area.
[154:21.62]Maybe?
[154:22.82]Possibly?
[154:31.78]Uh, one second.
[154:32.44]I just want to see something.
[154:33.71]Yeah, maybe like another, um,
[154:38.88]Maybe, like, another half an hour or so, guys.
[154:40.98]Maybe 40 minutes for me.
[154:44.10]I'm starting to get the, uh... The curdling stomach feeling at the moment.
[154:50.49]But... You will see this game tomorrow.
[154:54.93]I'm gonna keep playing this game.
[154:56.99]Because I'm actually having a very good time.
[154:59.99]I don't really have any complaints at all.
[155:04.90]So, maybe get to the next area.
[155:07.11]Explore the next area a little bit.
[155:08.93]And then we're going to play this tomorrow.
[155:20.09]Loud poop?
[155:21.10]What?
[155:23.28]Have I tried drinking kefir?
[155:24.46]I drink kefir all the time.
[155:26.34]Kefir is one of my favorite drinks.
[155:29.02]I love that stuff.
[155:30.54]I drink Lifeway kefir.
[155:32.24]Lifeway.
[155:35.35]Oh, I'm dead.
[155:40.47]First death.
[155:47.82]Stream Friday.
[155:48.26]I'm going to stream for the next three days.
[155:50.34]It'll be tonight, tomorrow, and Friday.
[155:54.95]Just having a little bit of these colitis issues at the moment.
[155:59.99]On top of being kind of puke-sick.
[156:04.28]Hasn't been very fun.
[156:06.02]But I don't have a map of this area yet.
[156:07.90]But can I... Can I dash through the puke?
[156:11.14]The bile?
[156:11.58]I don't know.
[156:16.20]Fuck.
[156:18.20]Yeah, kefir is a... It's like... It's dairy.
[156:21.97]It's milk.
[156:23.85]They call it the champagne of dairy.
[156:25.33]Can I dash through this?
[156:29.49]Maybe I can't go in here yet.
[156:34.18]Fuck.
[156:37.12]Can't dash through it.
[156:37.92]Can't swing at it.
[156:42.42]Okay.
[156:43.89]I'm not entirely sure what to do then.
[156:47.29]Do I just have to keep exploring this area?
[156:54.61]Maybe.
[156:54.89]Until I can find a way to get through that.
[156:56.77]Hmm.
[157:00.73]Hmm.
[157:01.42]Hmm.
[157:02.44]Hmm.
[157:06.57]Hey, there's your first death We were talking about like haven't died yet, and I just fucking died I lost all my money Are you fucking serious?
[157:32.59]Sitting there like being a dickhead and I just died and I lost everything
[157:37.59]Why did we have to talk about it?
[157:40.59]And now I'm all the fucking way back here.
[157:43.77]You gotta be kidding me.
[157:47.28]We jinxed me so fucking hard.
[157:50.54]Give me a break.
[157:54.40]I just lost 800 fucking dollars.
[157:59.68]Oh my god.
[158:00.90]Fuck.
[158:03.77]No.
[158:04.07]Where's the...
[158:06.06]We gotta ride the beetle.
[158:07.68]This is fucking stupid.
[158:11.96]I ain't walking all the way again.
[158:16.52]I was just sitting there casually talking about how I didn't die and I got hit by two meteors.
[158:24.32]I'm gonna go ride the ferry.
[158:35.20]Ferries down here, right?
[158:43.10]Take me down there.
[158:51.27]Queen station.
[158:51.95]If I go up from the queen station, right?
[158:57.01]I haven't lost the money yet.
[158:57.91]I really enjoy this game.
[159:02.21]I do.
[159:04.86]I guess I just wasn't paying very much attention.
[159:06.60]So, do I go up?
[159:11.71]If I remember right, I just have to go up from here.
[159:13.65]I don't even remember.
[159:15.15]I'm pretty sure I have to go up.
[159:20.86]I think.
[159:23.14]Oh, there's this dumb lady.
[159:37.85]Just like, I gotta go claim it.
[159:39.27]Yeah, well... Alright, um... Up, right?
[159:45.95]Wherever... I'm pretty sure it's right here, right?
[159:48.19]Just gotta go really slow.
[159:50.46]These things are the worst.
[159:52.18]You things, you guys suck.
[159:54.20]Like, seriously, don't die here.
[159:58.38]Those things are so horrible.
[160:00.90]Because it's in these little corridors, these tiny little hallways, and it's just a homing rocket that shoots right in your face.
[160:08.68]Jeez.
[160:14.60]She's not dumb.
[160:15.36]She's cute.
[160:18.03]You can be cute and dumb.
[160:23.03]Have I played Night in the Woods?
[160:23.91]I have not.
[160:24.93]Just ignore them?
[160:26.55]Yeah, but what's the fun in that?
[160:27.43]I need my 100% completion rate.
[160:31.74]I don't think I can even get up here, by the way.
[160:33.42]Oh, yeah, I can.
[160:39.87]It was up here.
[160:40.73]I got hit up here, right?
[160:50.32]Um... Where is it?
[160:52.52]Oh, dear.
[160:59.39]It's gonna dash.
[161:03.61]I don't want to fight these dumb things.
[161:07.51]I say that and I just accidentally...
[161:12.52]Shot the goddamn thing.
[161:16.43]No, I don't like how careful I have to be here.
[161:18.75]I don't like this.
[161:19.25]There's my ghost.
[161:19.85]There's my ghost.
[161:20.35]There's my ghost.
[161:22.29]I just have to shoot my ghost in the face.
[161:26.69]There we go.
[161:28.11]Like it never happened.
[161:29.07]Okay, cool.
[161:33.19]I've already gotten the bad ending for killing that NPC.
[161:35.29]There's no point in going forward.
[161:37.69]I guess, right?
[161:42.43]So how do I come back this way now?
[161:49.07]So what's the deal now?
[161:50.15]I obviously have to find some way to get through that bile so I can get the map.
[162:00.36]I don't know.
[162:04.96]This does not seem like I can go across it, so...
[162:11.16]Right?
[162:11.52]Can't go that way.
[162:12.82]I'm gonna go get my surfboard.
[162:15.30]There's been a lot of opportunities where I needed a surfboard.
[162:21.23]What's the deal with airline food?
[162:24.37]What's the deal with airline food?
[162:27.82]What's happening?
[162:28.52]What's the deal?
[162:28.94]What's going on here?
[162:31.08]You can't do that.
[162:31.88]You can't.
[162:32.64]Airlines.
[162:35.50]This is not right.
[162:38.45]Um, this just takes me to the bank, which I don't necessarily... Maybe I should.
[162:44.05]I'm gonna.
[162:50.52]I'll deposit, like, enough.
[162:57.56]$20 joke?
[163:01.20]Whatever, just put it all in there.
[163:03.60]My dumbass will lose all this.
[163:11.79]Alright.
[163:13.83]Alright.
[163:14.91]Alright.
[163:16.41]You guys ready for like a... Hey, are you guys ready for Jeremy, Jerma985, to transition to a new stage of thinking or a new stage of the game?
[163:26.14]Alright.
[163:26.88]So... Okay.
[163:29.42]Alright.
[163:33.41]Deposited that money.
[163:34.39]Time to go to a new thing, do a new... Alright.
[163:48.84]Uh-oh.
[163:50.22]So where the hell am I going to go?
[163:51.98]Oh, you dumb shithead.
[163:53.20]I hate these things.
[163:53.96]Is there anywhere that I haven't gone to that's up this way?
[164:02.03]I don't think so.
[164:03.95]Get out of the way.
[164:04.57]This is like the Mario enemies.
[164:05.65]They're the worst.
[164:06.13]I guess I'm just going to have to go this way.
[164:10.12]We're going to backtrack and see if I can go up at all.
[164:17.82]Just over there.
[164:20.19]Try this.
[164:31.80]Can I even get up there?
[164:34.56]Duck!
[164:35.80]No!
[164:38.30]Fuck.
[164:38.74]I gotta be perfect.
[164:40.42]Oh, shit.
[164:44.55]No!
[164:48.77]I don't think I can do that.
[164:49.83]I died twice.
[164:50.81]I've died twice now.
[164:55.32]Map updated.
[164:55.98]I don't even have a fucking map.
[165:00.28]I don't have a map for this area.
[165:02.12]I can't get the fucking map because I'm not allowed to go get it.
[165:07.76]I can't get the map.
[165:09.16]Alright, you want to hear a complaint?
[165:10.26]You want to hear my first complaint about this game?
[165:14.06]What's with this map bullshit?
[165:16.00]That's what I'm going to call map bullshit.
[165:20.51]What's up with that?
[165:21.99]What's the deal with that?
[165:23.97]Why does every area I have to find a new map?
[165:28.35]I should have the map!
[165:29.47]I've already been playing the game!
[165:30.53]Where's the map?
[165:31.59]That's a terrible... I'm fucking angry.
[165:34.21]If you can't already tell.
[165:37.31]No, I'm not.
[165:37.85]I'm just kidding.
[165:38.39]This is a joke.
[165:39.03]I'm fine.
[165:39.71]It's alright.
[165:42.93]It's okay.
[165:44.39]I wish I knew where the fuck I was going.
[165:51.54]I can't even do a Jerry Seinfeld because I'm too angry at the fact that I have to find a map for every new area.
[165:57.16]Just give it to me.
[165:58.74]Give me the magic compass.
[166:01.21]You know?
[166:03.45]I should have a magic compass by now.
[166:08.09]Every game you have to find the map.
[166:09.21]No, it's not true.
[166:10.07]Fallout New Vegas.
[166:12.03]Oh yeah?
[166:12.29]What about that?
[166:12.74]What about Fallout New Vegas?
[166:23.24]Oh, you think so?
[166:24.64]What about... What about Mario Galaxy?
[166:26.60]How do I get... What?
[166:31.94]Did I go the wrong way?
[166:38.67]It is literally my... Oh, no.
[166:40.07]I'm just kidding around, guys.
[166:45.29]Trust me.
[166:46.21]I'm just joking around.
[166:49.25]Did I go by it?
[167:02.66]Oh boy, thank God I deposited that money You stupid asshole get out of the way.
[167:11.12]I don't need to fight you.
[167:12.12]There's no reason to fight this guy.
[167:14.82]I didn't lose anything Okay, we're good
[167:34.16]okay holy shit dude really fuck me wow this so it's up dash Jesus
[168:09.77]Alright.
[168:10.45]We're fine.
[168:12.26]Everybody calm down.
[168:13.62]We're okay.
[168:15.76]It was just... It was just a little bullshit that we had to deal with right there.
[168:22.52]No big deal.
[168:24.46]And there's an item on the ground.
[168:27.53]Hollow nest seal.
[168:34.03]What is that?
[168:38.57]Official seal of the Kingdom of Holonis, symbolizing the authority of the king and his knights.
[168:42.19]Relic from Holonis past, this item now holds little value except for those dedicated to the kingdom's history.
[168:48.79]What?
[168:50.29]The fuck does that mean?
[168:54.48]Like, what is that?
[168:56.58]Can I... It's just... I just have it equipped?
[168:59.00]I have one of them equipped?
[169:04.40]Well, I can get the soul hearts at least.
[169:12.92]At least I can get the soul hearts.
[169:14.54]Now we go down.
[169:16.42]Please hit the blue thing.
[169:17.42]I know about that.
[169:18.18]Yeah, that's like the third one of those I've seen.
[169:22.82]Okay.
[169:35.09]Are we in green path again?
[169:37.07]No?
[169:37.67]No?
[169:42.56]Interesting.
[169:48.74]This fell so far.
[169:49.62]Another one of these dumb things that I can't go through.
[169:53.36]This game makes you feel nostalgic?
[170:01.03]Well, it makes me feel great.
[170:02.71]I like this game.
[170:07.35]This game is scratching some itches.
[170:09.21]I don't know why.
[170:09.77]It just kind of is.
[170:14.18]Shit.
[170:18.14]Hmm.
[170:20.80]Okay, well, there's not much else for me to do, is there?
[170:23.83]I wish I knew what to do with these black bile things.
[170:30.99]Can't go up.
[170:32.83]Well, whatever.
[170:37.37]Shit.
[170:42.58]Nothing I can do, then.
[170:47.50]Nothing at all.
[170:52.15]Yeah, you can't go that way.
[170:55.39]Well, whatever.
[170:59.35]Can't really do anything.
[171:16.91]Can't go under, can I?
[171:19.95]I thought that was a place for me to stand.
[171:21.37]I thought I could, like, sneak under there.
[171:22.69]Already been up there.
[171:37.80]Not sure, guys.
[171:44.14]I guess maybe I have to go back to the beginning of the game, in a way?
[171:48.72]I guess?
[171:49.04]Because this is bringing me down where the map is.
[172:10.47]I gotta go back.
[172:11.15]Yeah, there's nothing I can do here.
[172:13.69]I'm a little over my head at the moment.
[172:19.13]That is for sure.
[172:24.01]I'm going back.
[172:25.47]Let's just go ride the train to the first area.
[172:28.32]Let's just fall to our deaths till we get to the first area.
[172:42.03]Can't do that.
[172:50.12]Oh, hold on.
[172:53.38]Exploring.
[172:54.42]We are exploring.
[172:55.72]Oh, I couldn't make that jump before.
[173:03.73]Wait.
[173:08.47]Fungal Wasteslands.
[173:10.69]Wasteslands.
[173:12.73]That's a bad guy.
[173:13.89]Thought it might have been an NPC being like, Welcome to the Fungal Wastes, my child.
[173:30.34]okay there's something over here uh I'm gonna get to a point where I can stop so the next uh rest point I'm going to call it a day there because I want to go take some tums and eat a little bit of a snack or something so let's see if I can do anything over here the music here is very good
[173:59.76]okay that was an explosion that was a very big explosion fine I'll take it what is this what is this the dash is going to be useful here I can assume the dead person over there wait a minute can I have him blow up the wall can this wall be blown up I don't think so
[174:33.23]Need currency?
[174:34.63]Ah, shit.
[174:35.23]Whoa!
[174:36.43]Alright, these guys have a terrible voice.
[174:49.80]Wah!
[174:54.78]Wah!
[174:57.50]Wah!
[175:08.13]The way this area looks is really cool too.
[175:14.64]We're just farming some money at the moment.
[175:16.16]If I can get more than like a hundred, hopefully.
[175:23.38]I need a rest area.
[175:24.82]I need a lot of things right now, don't I?
[175:31.19]Owen Wilson.
[175:35.03]It's the Owen Wilson shrooms.
[175:37.23]Oh, wow.
[175:38.67]Wow.
[175:40.39]Oh, wow.
[175:40.83]I love you.
[175:41.75]Wow.
[175:43.47]Wow.
[175:45.03]Wow.
[175:47.36]That's good.
[175:47.88]Who said that?
[175:48.92]Who said that?
[175:49.56]Because that was funny.
[175:52.26]Wow.
[175:56.06]Did you just open up something?
[175:59.19]Wow, you just opened something up.
[176:02.15]You just totally, totally opened a
[176:09.25]It's truly, it's unbelievable.
[176:11.13]Give me that cash.
[176:19.43]Mod Owen Wilson.
[176:22.62]Yeah, okay.
[176:24.78]Okay.
[176:26.10]I will mod Owen Wilson, sure.
[176:28.64]If Owen Wilson comes in this chat right now, the real one, and he proves it on Twitter, then yeah, sure, I'll mod him.
[176:38.76]He's gonna prove it though.
[176:40.06]I want like a Twitter verified Owen Wilson to say that.
[176:48.31]This didn't open?
[176:49.29]Shit.
[176:52.21]Shit!
[176:52.85]Where am I going?
[176:53.48]Okay.
[177:00.82]Um... Kinda lost right now.
[177:03.14]I need to... My stomach is starting to bother me.
[177:06.63]It's starting to make me not be able to pay attention.
[177:10.27]I don't think I went.
[177:12.72]I guess we have to go back.
[177:13.52]Oh wait, did I go over here?
[177:19.28]Owen, it's your only chance.
[177:21.06]Yeah, Owen Wilson, it's your only chance.
[177:24.40]Let's go back that way.
[177:35.35]Ow.
[177:43.71]Can I go up and try it?
[177:51.49]Get the little coins.
[177:52.85]Let's go up, up, up.
[177:55.48]Yeah, looks like I can go this way.
[177:57.12]Just gotta avoid the bombs.
[178:02.52]And there is something here.
[178:03.92]Another seal.
[178:07.15]Game, I don't know what the hell those things do.
[178:09.39]But holy shit, am I in big trouble.
[178:20.03]We're good.
[178:27.84]Do everyone tweet at Owen Wilson?
[178:32.70]No, don't do that.
[178:34.60]Don't make me look like a dickhead.
[178:40.48]Owen Wilson's going to be like, what's happening?
[178:42.10]I don't understand.
[178:42.86]There's just so many people coming from the SkypeJerma985's channel.
[178:47.76]Wow, it just doesn't make any sense.
[178:51.08]By the way, you're wonderful.
[178:52.77]I could live with you.
[178:53.47]I could be forever with you.
[178:56.13]Why can't I jump?
[178:56.81]Ooh.
[179:06.69]Cash.
[179:07.79]Cash.
[179:08.75]Cash.
[179:09.63]Cash.
[179:13.46]He's gonna, like, talk to his publicist.
[179:16.44]What's happening?
[179:17.84]Why are all these people... Did I do something wrong?
[179:22.86]This is, instead of Owen Wilson, this is turning into Little Nicky.
[179:27.51]This is turning into Adam Sandler.
[179:29.27]It's not necessarily Owen Wilson anymore.
[179:31.75]It's turning into... He got it with a shovel.
[179:35.15]Alright, where's the map guy?
[179:37.83]I gotta start paying attention.
[179:41.13]Ow.
[179:47.47]Get out of here.
[179:53.45]I can hear him.
[179:58.65]Yeah, you want to work on your own, Wilson?
[180:00.33]Just work on your little Nicky.
[180:03.31]You'll get it.
[180:08.16]There he is.
[180:08.82]Hey, it's me.
[180:10.76]I'm the guy that sells you maps.
[180:13.80]Yeah.
[180:15.60]I would love a map.
[180:21.10]Hey, thanks.
[180:28.18]Now I see where I'm going.
[180:29.22]Okay.
[180:31.72]So, we gotta go down to the right.
[180:35.18]Down to the right?
[180:36.62]Down to the right.
[180:40.76]Over and down.
[180:42.78]Or we can go left, too.
[180:44.68]We're gonna go down to the right.
[180:59.05]I guess we can't do that.
[181:02.30]Never mind.
[181:03.68]And we can't go left either, so we have to go up.
[181:09.26]Oh, that's actually probably a fairly good stopping point.
[181:11.46]Let me just get back to where I was.
[181:19.13]Yeah, and you can turn Owen Wilson or Little Nicky into Richard Nixon.
[181:22.73]That's true.
[181:24.73]Yeah.
[181:25.49]Owen Wilson is a little more calm and collected, and he just loves it.
[181:29.87]He loves being around.
[181:30.88]Little Nicky is a little harsher, and it's just there's a little more S's on things, and then if you really want to get into Richard Nixon, just add some more S's and add some more shakes when you move your face around.
[181:43.40]They're all connected.
[181:44.40]Everybody's connected.
[181:47.65]So, again, we're going to go over this again.
[181:49.37]Owen Wilson, less SH.
[181:51.63]Little Nicky, more SH.
[181:54.01]And Richard Nixon, shake well SH.
[181:57.01]Harsh SH.
[181:57.53]You know what I mean?
[181:59.93]You'll get it all down.
[182:06.65]Head back here.
[182:09.03]Everything's connected.
[182:12.63]Speaking of everything, I'm going to call it here.
[182:15.68]I'm just going to get to a bench, which is over this way.
[182:25.27]We got a map updated.
[182:27.21]And that's a save point.
[182:29.69]Options okay, yeah, I'm gonna call it here.
[182:33.51]I'll be back tomorrow There's the $250 job there you go, there's the $250 job Richard Nixon Owen Wilson and little Nikki are the same person just throughout different stages of their life So tomorrow night We are gonna be playing this again.
[182:57.58]We're gonna continue playing Hollow Knight and
[183:01.72]I just wasn't around yesterday and I wanted to make sure I was around today.
[183:05.94]Because I've not been feeling well.
[183:08.60]I've been feeling pretty terrible, actually.
[183:11.10]Really terrible.
[183:11.98]Especially like a day or two ago.
[183:14.62]But I'm okay now, I think.
[183:18.18]One more of these days here and I'll be good to go.
[183:21.18]But if you want my first impressions of the first three hours of this game, like three and some change, I would say to get it.
[183:28.93]I think this is pretty fantastic so far.
[183:33.17]I can't see how a game like this will really turn out to be ruined for me.
[183:36.39]I don't think anything could really happen.
[183:38.83]But I guess it does ramp up very, very quickly in difficulty, so we'll find that out tomorrow.
[183:43.54]So, good night.
[183:44.36]See you guys tomorrow.
[183:45.64]Have a good rest of your night, everybody.
[183:47.72]And I'll see you guys tomorrow night, 7 o'clock.
[183:50.22]Have a good night, guys.
[183:52.44]And goodbye.
[184:05.56]you
[184:40.42]Thank you.
