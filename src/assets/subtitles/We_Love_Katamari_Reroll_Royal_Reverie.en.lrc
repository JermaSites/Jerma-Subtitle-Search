[ve:60.16.100]

[00:22.00]I was not late.
[00:22.64]I was on time.
[00:24.87]Yeah.
[00:28.43]I'm here at the appropriate hour today.
[00:34.32]You were one minute late.
[00:37.08]That's alright.
[00:37.72]Alright, what's your favorite word?
[00:52.60]Uh... Truck.
[00:57.44]I don't know.
[00:58.18]I don't know about it.
[00:58.94]I just thought of the first thing I could think of.
[01:06.39]I don't know.
[01:07.97]I thought of the first word I could think of.
[01:10.01]I was just like, okay, I guess... Whatever.
[01:12.78]It's pretty... It's fine.
[01:14.30]It's fine.
[01:24.88]Or... What are you saying?
[01:26.04]What did you say?
[01:28.26]Let me see.
[01:28.50]What did you say?
[01:31.92]What should I get at Taco Bell?
[01:32.98]I'm in the line.
[01:33.98]Please hurry.
[01:35.58]Cheesy Goody to Crunch.
[01:36.32]That's it.
[01:37.26]Take two of them.
[01:37.80]That's it.
[01:38.48]And maybe a drink?
[01:41.26]Does he even know he's live?
[01:43.94]I just clicked the button.
[01:45.45]I know I'm live.
[01:53.39]He doesn't have enough fiber?
[01:55.89]Oh, quantum.
[01:56.66]Yeah, no, quantum is a good word.
[01:59.64]Quantum.
[02:01.60]Quantum just sounds elaborate.
[02:04.24]It sounds interesting.
[02:05.58]Something's going on with that word.
[02:06.66]You know what I mean?
[02:07.12]It's very interesting.
[02:08.50]Lots to break down with that word.
[02:10.26]Quantum.
[02:15.21]Fulcrum.
[02:17.09]That's pretty good.
[02:20.27]Package is a good word.
[02:21.29]There are a lot of good words.
[02:27.87]Anyways, he doesn't even remember saying that.
[02:30.13]No, I don't.
[02:34.08]My hard drive is being filled with new information and I'm cleaning out the shit from before.
[02:41.78]I have a full hard drive.
[02:43.82]Just wait.
[02:44.82]Just wait.
[02:45.18]I want you all to wait until you turn over 35.
[02:48.31]When you get to be 35 plus, shit just starts getting front filled.
[02:55.71]You only have a 512 kilobyte hard drive?
[02:58.77]Bro, upgrade.
[02:59.74]I, no.
[03:03.24]Ster just cleared Q Remastered.
[03:05.88]It's time to pack it up.
[03:07.48]You know, I talked to Ster about this.
[03:10.40]And I was like, oh yeah, that game, Cube Remastered.
[03:12.93]Yeah.
[03:14.41]Like, what a fucking ridiculous, hard fucking game.
[03:17.25]Like, you played it for like 20 minutes, right?
[03:20.35]He's, he loves this game.
[03:23.76]And apparently he plays it all the time.
[03:25.82]And he's almost 100% of the whole experience.
[03:32.92]really he's like yeah yeah actually like I watched you do it and I kind of felt that way too just kind of doing I had to know what the hell was going on and when I finally got it it became like like it was an amazing experience like wow sounds like Ster's got a pretty high iq caveman brain versus genius brain
[04:02.58]Which one is which, though?
[04:05.71]Hm.
[04:07.59]Which one is which?
[04:09.21]Hm.
[04:11.47]Hm.
[04:12.51]Hm.
[04:15.25]A genius caveman.
[04:22.88]Dude, you've got a rat brain?
[04:31.98]yeah whatever alright I my brain is very good at very specific things but I think we're all like that aren't aren't you good at a few things that you can really go like you know I'm really good at this I'm not really good at these things too though you can't be good at everything and you're not bad at everything either you get it
[04:58.56]You can't be good at everything, but you're not bad at everything either.
[05:02.77]Write it down.
[05:03.39]That's a quote.
[05:05.71]I made that quote.
[05:06.51]Write it down.
[05:12.93]And you attribute that to me when you say that.
[05:14.72]Is that fair?
[05:24.32]I wrote it down.
[05:25.22]I wrote it down.
[05:26.50]That's not how quotes work.
[05:32.34]Alright, we're going to play Katamari.
[05:35.16]I didn't even know this came out last week.
[05:37.70]I was unaware.
[05:40.72]We Love Katamari, the remake, came out.
[05:45.76]Played the first remake.
[05:47.45]Obviously, I love this franchise.
[05:48.85]I think this is a great franchise.
[05:50.79]Really cool to see that they ported and recalibrated another one, too.
[05:55.27]This is the second game.
[05:56.55]This is Katamari 2, I believe.
[06:01.38]I saw one BatChest, which is a really good sign that usually, okay, if one person is bat chesting something and it's not a wave of them, then, alright, then that just means, alright, come on.
[06:14.14]That means that that person is just, oh, it's Katamari.
[06:17.92]You don't BatChest Katamari nowadays?
[06:20.11]No, we don't.
[06:21.15]Who does?
[06:25.15]You probably don't even know what the game is.
[06:28.53]You probably don't even know what the game is.
[06:31.16]You just saw that I was playing it and I was excited about it, so you wanted to BatChest to make me feel bad.
[06:35.46]You can quote that one, too.
[06:43.89]Exactly.
[06:44.53]Alright, let's... I'm probably not going to stream for too, too long tonight.
[06:50.97]I...
[06:52.82]I don't want to be excuse Andy, but I do have kind of a bad headache, and it's going to affect me.
[07:00.30]You can already tell, like, four or five hours from now.
[07:05.43]So, not that short.
[07:06.79]Just probably not, like, over six or seven hours.
[07:08.65]Alright.
[07:13.41]You guys ready?
[07:13.75]Let's go chill.
[07:17.21]It'll be a chill stream.
[07:22.34]Oh, here it is.
[07:27.18]Drink more water?
[07:27.92]I am.
[07:33.10]I don't just get up in the morning and go through my whole day and afternoon just like... Something's wrong today.
[07:41.23]I just wish I... Maybe if I had one sip of water, it'd fix it.
[07:47.79]I drink a lot of water.
[07:50.09]I'll prove it.
[07:54.30]See?
[07:54.40]Alright, let's go.
[07:57.86]Does the controller work?
[08:02.75]Oh, that's kinda loud.
[08:06.61]Kinda loud for me.
[08:10.45]Are you a- No, I'm not a milk guy.
[08:15.58]Why do people ask that every week?
[08:18.92]Hey dude, do you like to drink milk and shit?
[08:22.08]Why are you asking this question?
[08:23.42]You ask it all the time.
[08:29.72]Hey dude, talk about milk for 20 minutes.
[08:32.82]Why do you want me to continue to do this?
[08:34.32]Alright, let's watch.
[08:37.68]This is good.
[08:47.81]This game is so good too.
[08:48.93]I think this is probably the best one, isn't it?
[08:50.68]Wasn't two, was two or three the best one?
[08:52.20]Yeah, two is the best one, isn't it?
[09:09.81]We talked about video game soundtracks and how what is actually the best video game soundtrack.
[09:16.03]Katamari is probably up there in the top five.
[09:21.13]It is.
[09:21.73]It actually might be in one or two.
[09:23.85]It's possible.
[09:26.68]These games always had unbelievable soundtracks.
[09:29.46]Every single track was amazing.
[09:30.92]Every single one.
[09:31.46]There wasn't a single bad song.
[09:34.58]It's definitely in the top five, top ten.
[09:42.96]We're not skipping any songs.
[09:46.64]Alright, let's go.
[09:48.60]Uh... This is... I opened this.
[09:53.09]Making a new save, yeah.
[09:54.57]I opened the game just to capture it, so don't worry.
[09:56.63]I didn't play already.
[09:57.45]People are going to be very upset about that.
[10:00.87]The Great Cosmos.
[10:03.69]A world of mystery, both tantalizing and terrifying.
[10:08.98]Not a very well-publicized world to understand, but a glamorous and influential world nevertheless.
[10:18.63]Are you bald?
[10:19.37]No.
[10:22.21]I'm getting there, though.
[10:23.83]I got another, like, at least five good years.
[10:25.17]Bold yet sensitive and rugged to boot.
[10:28.64]Tolerant and compassionate with a heart deeper than the oceans.
[10:33.56]such is the great cosmos and the king that rules over it is marvelous to behold except for the one time that he destroyed all the stars in the universe no big deal really that was a good laugh having come to and realized the folly of his ways the wisest of kings sent to the planet Earth his beloved son the prince and commanded him to make a katamari of ample proportions
[11:05.42]That was an AI-generated comment.
[11:16.00]More things than you can count vaulting boxes pencils erasers postcards ramen robots cows The prince
[11:41.99]rolled them all up rolled and rolled until the katamari was big enough to be lifted up to space to replace the shiny stars that were so grievously lost and that dear friends was the plot and purpose of the fabulous game called katamari diversity
[12:05.08]its popularity recognized no boundaries or borders and it rolled right out of the game to bundle away the many and sundry ills that blight the modern world overnight the king found himself a superstar the adulation of the crowd knew no limits I want to meet the king I think he should be bigger
[12:27.66]every audiobook you've ever heard by the way every audiobook you've ever listened to is that oh dear such a chorus fans crying out from all over the world for the magnificent and I love it by the way
[13:08.33]Still not enough stars.
[13:17.12]Ah, sweet memories.
[13:18.32]Yes, it was that time.
[13:19.68]That time we smashed all the stars in the sky.
[13:24.09]It's like something out of a dream.
[13:25.39]We should have totally forgotten.
[13:29.31]What made us remember?
[13:31.87]Lookie, the only place with stars is around Earth.
[13:35.83]Looks like Katamari Damacy was being lazy.
[13:39.53]Looks like Katamari Damacy had everyone fooled.
[13:43.37]What impresses us all over is the scale of destruction we rock.
[13:49.02]We were on a roll, yes we were.
[13:51.32]Fierce and fabulous, we certainly were.
[13:54.35]We were really something, yes, yes.
[13:57.11]Oh, speaking of something, there's a tidbit.
[13:59.97]Not what we get.
[14:01.15]Not that we get it.
[14:02.31]But it seems we're quite a hit.
[14:05.39]SCORN.
[14:05.89]A big hit with Earth, the star so full of stuff.
[14:11.15]The star now apparently full of our fans.
[14:16.14]Prince!
[14:16.48]Prince!
[14:17.54]What do you think they love about us?
[14:19.70]Our looks?
[14:20.18]Our tights?
[14:20.92]Our mustache?
[14:23.14]Oh!
[14:23.30]Eureka!
[14:23.82]We've got it!
[14:25.10]It's our chin!
[14:26.12]Yes!
[14:26.70]That must be it!
[14:27.76]Yes!
[14:28.10]Must be!
[14:29.11]Our chin is so magnificent!
[14:31.05]Earth is full of dedicated followers of our chin.
[14:33.11]I want to hold your chin!
[14:35.23]Let me feel your goatee!
[14:37.23]They ask so nicely.
[14:38.81]So passionately.
[14:39.71]How can we say no?
[14:41.71]Oh, that's right, they did this overworld thing
[15:08.21]Looks like the fans in the Select Plaza want to ask the prince something.
[15:11.99]Talk to them.
[15:13.43]An icon will be displayed at the bottom of the screen when new fans arrive.
[15:16.99]Make their dreams come true.
[15:29.23]I love this part.
[15:30.09]I'm going to turn it up a little.
[15:38.65]Okay.
[15:39.07]Hi.
[15:39.99]Oh, I forgot.
[15:40.83]How do I do this?
[15:43.01]Nice to meet you, Your Highness.
[15:45.47]Boy, it was fun.
[15:46.08]I think it must have been fun.
[15:48.24]I'm sorry.
[15:49.06]I've forgotten.
[15:50.42]I've completely forgotten how to roll the Katamari.
[15:53.16]I know I'm a goof, but I love Katamari Debasi.
[15:56.02]Help me remember, please.
[15:58.46]Vittorio.
[16:03.53]Alright, let's leave our fans on Earth to the prince.
[16:07.57]Now, where shall we go and play?
[16:09.73]Oh, it's the prince.
[16:11.74]What do you want with us?
[16:13.32]What?
[16:13.70]Oh, you forgot.
[16:15.56]Forgot how to roll the Katamari?
[16:17.02]How to enjoy the Katamari?
[16:19.48]The meaning of life?
[16:20.36]Of course you forgot.
[16:22.20]The things you can't forget that make you hurt.
[16:24.46]We think it may be better not to dredge things up.
[16:29.07]Your highness is cool.
[16:33.26]No, it's important to remember.
[16:34.44]No, it's crucial to remember.
[16:35.90]Yes.
[16:36.88]We'll just try and think back.
[16:37.98]Yes, yes.
[16:39.72]Bugleberry.
[16:41.34]Bugleberry voice.
[16:43.28]Lots of different applications.
[16:49.62]Friends that forgot all about Katamari Damacy.
[16:52.62]Poor friends.
[16:55.24]Playing the very first game of Katamari Damacy.
[17:00.52]Would you guys buy...
[17:03.91]An audiobook, just like a horror story read by Bugleberry.
[17:11.62]Was that something that you would want?
[17:12.64]Alright, so what is a Katamari?
[17:21.20]What could a Katamari be?
[17:22.50]What does Katamari taste like?
[17:24.47]Does it have a point?
[17:25.67]Why roll?
[17:26.45]Why make it bigger?
[17:27.47]So many opinions and schools of thought, but let's just try it out first.
[17:32.50]Here you, here you, we present to you in all and sundry the Katamari.
[17:40.95]Only if it's at least eight hours.
[17:45.21]It would have to be a book that I got permission to read.
[17:49.23]And kind of have it licensed out to me or something.
[17:52.95]It would have to be a really obscure horror book.
[17:56.82]And it has to be less than 200 pages.
[18:04.29]Take the standard Katamari and roll it firmly.
[18:06.03]Okay, it's a left and right stick.
[18:10.36]I kind of remember.
[18:10.96]Alright, let's go.
[18:19.03]Yeah, you can go backwards, you can go side to side.
[18:23.07]You can just spin around.
[18:24.79]There we go.
[18:39.65]Roll up some stuff.
[18:40.75]The best part of the game.
[18:42.12]This is, okay.
[18:43.96]This whole game is just oddly satisfying the entire game.
[18:46.76]If you've actually never played this before, even have seen this be played, get it.
[18:50.20]Go get it right now.
[18:52.20]Get it now.
[19:01.81]If there's one thing you do this week,
[19:08.65]This game is not expensive, right?
[19:10.15]I think it's like 20 bucks, 30 bucks?
[19:14.85]It wasn't that bad, right?
[19:19.39]30 bucks?
[19:30.04]What the heck am I looking at?
[19:31.88]You're looking at a very, very good video game.
[19:38.94]alright we have to overcome the wall not big enough yet the soundtrack is so good too just wait till you hear some of these classic beats
[20:06.57]Alright.
[20:07.23]Wowies, you got up there.
[20:11.69]Prince turn.
[20:12.77]Oh, that's huge.
[20:13.46]Yep.
[20:14.26]That's a big... That's a big freaking deal.
[20:19.10]Quick turn.
[20:19.56]You can also do the Katamari view.
[20:26.12]You can just kind of take a look.
[20:29.53]These things get... I'm not going to spoil it for anybody who doesn't know.
[20:32.57]This game is just really fucking good.
[20:33.93]That's all you need to know.
[20:36.62]Okay, prince view.
[20:40.62]Ah, miracle eye?
[20:41.88]How are this?
[20:44.83]Let's just zoom.
[20:46.51]Miracle eye.
[20:48.41]Alright, then we're going to do the dash.
[20:52.37]The dash is just going to go.
[20:54.85]Oh, hold on.
[20:56.17]When you're just a little bigger, you could maybe roll ace up.
[20:58.91]Here, this is ace.
[20:59.83]A cousin to the prince.
[21:01.52]Or a cousin once removed.
[21:02.66]We forgot.
[21:03.22]Oh.
[21:04.26]Cousin, kin, something like that.
[21:06.73]Alrighty, time for you to challenge Ace head-on.
[21:08.97]If you go like this, you can go fast.
[21:14.30]Be careful.
[21:18.56]Is somebody just going to put a different soundtrack on?
[21:22.63]What?
[21:24.81]I'm not going to put a different soundtrack on one of the greatest soundtracks of all time in all video games.
[21:31.41]Can we get a poll up to see, is Katamari Damacy's soundtrack one of the most important pieces of media in history?
[21:37.03]Yes or no?
[21:37.97]Can we get a vote?
[21:43.04]Alright, let's get him.
[21:49.47]Fabulous, you're pretty good.
[21:51.13]Anyway, let's go back.
[21:54.67]Royal Rainbow.
[21:59.99]Is Katamari's soundtrack a big deal?
[22:02.21]That's a good, vague way to word it.
[22:04.89]I like it.
[22:07.09]Is it a big deal?
[22:08.13]Hmm, was it like this, Katamari Damacy?
[22:13.21]Honestly, this is not what we were thinking.
[22:16.17]But it looks kind of fun.
[22:18.01]A kind of sort of fun game.
[22:21.69]18 centimeters, 7 millimeters.
[22:23.11]We see we are a little tough.
[22:25.39]So big, it's just a training run.
[22:28.17]Unbelievable size.
[22:29.39]Astonishing, really.
[22:30.88]Very and truly fabulous.
[22:34.50]Oh, it's Cousin Ace.
[22:35.40]What were you doing on Earth?
[22:37.76]You at the tutorial stage?
[22:41.08]We have no idea what you're talking about.
[22:42.56]Hmm, this feels... This feels strange-ish.
[22:48.84]But then we understand if that's a good thing or not.
[22:53.40]Oh wow, I remembered everything, really everything this time.
[22:56.08]It's totally the best, Katamari Damacy.
[22:58.42]Your Highness, thank you so much.
[23:00.34]This Katamari is just a token of my thanks.
[23:03.32]I'd like to offer it to you.
[23:05.42]Oh, really?
[23:06.42]You're giving it to us?
[23:07.92]Seriously, fabulous!
[23:09.33]Thank you, we are so pleased.
[23:11.15]What should we do with it?
[23:12.23]Oh, we can pop it up into the cosmos.
[23:14.71]Yes, that's what we'll do.
[23:20.64]Oh, alright, so you guys agree.
[23:23.60]Look, it's a star now.
[23:24.44]Wow, it's so beautiful.
[23:25.36]Are you gonna play the Jump King DLC?
[23:33.49]No.
[23:38.53]We totally forgot to tell you, but this is the Select Plaza.
[23:42.75]Talk to fans, chat with cousins, do a little saving, look at your collection, move around a little maybe while pressing X or right bumper.
[23:50.68]When you get tired of rolling, just hang out here.
[23:55.46]Okay, cool.
[23:58.04]I think we can... Yep, we can change.
[24:00.62]Should I be Ace or should I be the Prince?
[24:04.92]I'll be Ace.
[24:08.91]Reflection, 0.4%.
[24:16.77]Options.
[24:17.33]I think we're good with audio and everything.
[24:18.97]I put the graphics in a good spot.
[24:20.65]Alright, let's do the next one.
[24:22.14]I want to see the royal rainbow.
[24:24.38]Hello, your highness.
[24:25.14]I just love you.
[24:26.62]That beard, that nose, that chin, that style.
[24:29.72]I love it all.
[24:31.72]But I love the royal rainbow the best of all.
[24:35.38]My dream is to see a real live one.
[24:37.01]Please show me.
[24:39.64]But of course, I'll show you.
[24:44.40]We are hungry.
[24:45.34]Our tummy is empty.
[24:46.42]What shall we eat?
[24:48.00]Oh, it's ace.
[24:49.24]Hmm.
[24:50.62]What?
[24:51.76]What kind of food?
[24:53.10]Huh?
[24:54.16]Royal rainbow.
[24:56.42]Why, when our tummy is so empty?
[24:57.92]No way.
[24:58.52]Boring.
[25:01.06]Your highness, you're so striking.
[25:04.10]Striking.
[25:06.26]Oh.
[25:07.14]We so like rainbows.
[25:08.80]You must simply must... You simply must see it.
[25:12.15]Should we go ahead and make a Katavari too?
[25:15.06]Yes, yes, yes, let's go.
[25:22.84]Alright, yes, I'm so ready for this.
[25:25.32]We're hungry.
[25:26.14]Oh, let's roll here.
[25:27.44]This is an Earth home, so unbelievably small.
[25:32.42]Plenty spacious for Ace, but not so much for us.
[25:36.22]Oh, we forgot about the Katamari.
[25:38.15]How about this much time to make this big a Katamari?
[25:42.11]Three minutes for 15 centimeters.
[25:45.43]If you can manage, that would be nice.
[25:47.79]All righty, Ace, it's all yours now.
[25:51.71]Let's go!
[25:52.99]Ooh!
[25:54.11]Your first ever roll-up!
[25:57.73]It's 6 out of 10 today!
[25:59.51]It's 6-10!
[26:00.85]Congratulations!
[26:05.57]What did I even get?
[26:06.19]Alright, I gotta go.
[26:07.12]Only three minutes.
[26:07.68]Yep.
[26:15.40]Nice.
[26:15.58]Alright, the food... I don't want to leave until I get everything.
[26:23.33]What was it?
[26:23.79]15 centimeters, right?
[26:26.45]Yeah.
[26:29.35]Alright, I got to go this way.
[26:34.25]Too small to get anything else.
[26:42.44]I can't get the cat.
[26:44.38]Not yet.
[26:51.47]I want to get the cereal box too.
[26:52.79]Remind me the cereal box is up here.
[26:56.69]Oh shit, that's bad.
[26:57.77]Maybe not.
[26:58.49]No, it's okay.
[27:05.23]Oh, cousin.
[27:07.14]Come here, cousin.
[27:10.34]Yes.
[27:11.68]You just rolled up some weird buffness.
[27:17.14]Wait.
[27:18.66]Second cousin macho.
[27:20.36]Oh, stop getting in the way.
[27:24.38]Second cousin macho.
[27:30.57]Can't get these?
[27:31.21]Okay.
[27:32.31]I'm almost there.
[27:35.23]I got plenty of time.
[27:36.49]15, right?
[27:41.85]Not big enough for the tennis balls.
[27:45.34]Oh, look at all this.
[27:45.98]Look at how juicy this is.
[27:52.11]One minute left, we got it.
[27:52.91]Alright, I'm big enough to... I don't think I'm big enough for the cap.
[28:03.40]15 centimeters already!
[28:05.62]We asked for a 15... Wait, what?
[28:08.78]Does it have to be exact?
[28:16.93]Does it have to be exact?
[28:18.25]No, I don't think so.
[28:23.21]Make it bigger.
[28:27.17]Oh, your first ever crash.
[28:29.33]Wait, what?
[28:32.23]It's 610.
[28:32.83]Today is 610.
[28:34.99]The birthday of your first crash.
[28:40.00]Congratulations.
[28:42.82]I want to get all this stuff, but it's alright.
[28:48.70]Yup.
[28:50.02]Come on.
[28:50.64]Oh, sorry.
[28:51.56]I love this game.
[28:55.29]My tummy is empty.
[28:56.05]You're done.
[28:57.11]Shall we go home and get something to eat?
[28:59.51]Yes.
[29:02.33]Turn the music up.
[29:03.85]I'll go in the options and turn it up a little.
[29:10.33]I'm looking at my tags again.
[29:11.45]Tournament arc.
[29:12.77]Dislike.
[29:13.31]Boat cheese.
[29:13.93]Not the sus guy.
[29:15.19]Stop asking.
[29:15.87]This is... People are going to find this stream and look at those tags and be like, I fucking hate this guy.
[29:24.09]I would read those tags and go, I hate this streamer.
[29:26.29]I don't like this guy.
[29:30.08]Like this cream puff that looks so good.
[29:31.86]Oh, it's Katamari.
[29:34.76]That was a surprise, but what a... That's a word I don't know.
[29:39.58]It's 18 centimeters.
[29:40.70]Yes, well, so undistinguished.
[29:43.35]You can go bigger, you know.
[29:45.07]Do us a favor and roll a bigger one.
[29:51.16]Oh, it's Second Cousin Macho!
[29:52.98]What were you doing on Earth?
[29:55.02]Hmm, making friends with the Krapish.
[29:57.40]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[29:58.99]This feels, uh, it feels Snacks-ish.
[30:02.69]Oh, I had mostly Snacks.
[30:05.57]That's better.
[30:08.33]Do we understand what Snacks means?
[30:11.00]I got to see the Royal Rainbow, but it wasn't exactly lively.
[30:14.89]I think it's because the Katamari was so small.
[30:18.23]I'll give your highness this stale old Katamari.
[30:23.75]Oh no.
[30:26.74]Okay, cool.
[30:28.56]Into the cosmos.
[30:36.94]Oh, it's a star now.
[30:37.84]Wow, it's so beautiful.
[30:39.49]Wrong voice.
[30:42.72]The biscuit Uranus.
[31:37.99]That storyboard was quite interesting.
[31:40.09]It's a storyboard, but the pictures move.
[31:44.11]There's music.
[31:45.79]Extreme storyboard, that's what it is.
[31:49.89]It's called a movie.
[31:51.95]A fascinating movie.
[31:54.49]For that storyboard movie, what it showed is a glimpse into our youthful days.
[32:00.67]A pretty tumultuous tale of derring-do.
[32:04.31]We can't wait for episode two.
[32:06.35]But if we keep rolling, we'll eventually get to see it.
[32:10.07]Alrighty, we're going to roll on ahead.
[32:12.70]See you later.
[32:15.82]Battle mode has been unlocked.
[32:17.44]Talk with the one-player and two-player characters together.
[32:23.82]Where's Macho?
[32:32.11]Probably should save the game.
[32:37.62]There is an autosave, but I don't trust it.
[32:45.10]Okay.
[32:46.66]Uh, usual stuff?
[32:48.52]Controls, usual stuff.
[32:49.70]Yeah, alright.
[32:50.14]Rumble, it's fine.
[32:51.10]Alright, here we go.
[32:51.60]Background music.
[32:53.73]We want the sound effects a little bit lower, but we want the music a little higher.
[32:56.67]That's correct, right?
[32:57.41]Alright, we got a lot of new things going on.
[33:06.15]Alright, what are you doing?
[33:07.51]I'm really sleepy, but first I want to see a big Katamari.
[33:11.68]The songs you can set to background music increase as you play the game.
[33:14.56]Set your favorite song to the BGM using Y. Okay.
[33:17.54]Hey, King Dude.
[33:23.43]You're so cool and relaxed lounging around as usual.
[33:25.85]I love Katamari Damacy.
[33:28.17]I love how mellow it is.
[33:29.79]I'm copying Katamari Damacy and lounging around.
[33:31.71]Oh, now I'm falling asleep.
[33:34.39]Before I do, I want to see a real Katamari.
[33:37.13]Come on, dude.
[33:38.07]Show me.
[33:47.37]Oof.
[33:48.81]We were asleep.
[33:50.29]Or our eyes opened.
[33:52.19]Oh, Macho, what?
[33:53.91]What?
[33:55.09]He wants to see a Katamari before he goes to bed?
[33:57.39]What?
[33:59.63]Are you serious?
[34:01.11]No, this is Katamari Damacy.
[34:02.70]We are not that easy.
[34:04.90]We work hard at rolling, you know.
[34:06.52]No, no, not possible.
[34:08.46]Cannot be done, no.
[34:11.33]Your Highness is the best.
[34:16.73]The best?
[34:18.98]No, not impossible.
[34:20.36]Not at all.
[34:21.76]Yes, you are very and absolutely right.
[34:23.90]If anything, we should play except just before bed.
[34:26.94]Yes.
[34:28.72]All aboard.
[34:29.24]Let's make a Katamari.
[34:30.32]It's the best.
[34:41.11]So sleepy, after all.
[34:42.37]Let's roll here.
[34:45.07]It's a room again, but let's just work on getting it big.
[34:49.75]If you make it bigger, you can roll it in lots of other places.
[34:52.46]Um, let's see.
[34:55.66]How about this much time to make this big a Katamari?
[35:02.82]If you can manage, that would be nice.
[35:05.48]Alrighty, Macho, it's all yours now.
[35:11.73]Alright, gotta be big.
[35:14.37]Start with the basics.
[35:24.68]Shit, I'm losing time here.
[35:26.95]I gotta get bigger.
[35:27.63]Alright, sorry, we fell.
[35:30.75]No, this is perfect.
[35:32.91]Actually perfect.
[35:46.49]Oh, I'm not big enough for the nail polish or whatever it is.
[35:48.53]I have to come back here.
[35:54.68]Something is coming.
[35:55.56]What do you mean something is coming?
[35:57.72]Alright, I get the batteries.
[36:02.02]Here we go.
[36:02.40]Nice.
[36:02.62]I think I can get all these batteries.
[36:09.77]Yep.
[36:12.59]And the locks too.
[36:13.17]Yeah, I'm going to get all this stuff.
[36:22.35]Where's the prince?
[36:23.51]I changed character.
[36:24.13]I went to macho.
[36:24.81]Alright, a few more things.
[36:30.29]Something's coming.
[36:38.65]Nice.
[36:39.03]Alright, I'm big enough for the toothbrushes.
[36:40.37]Can I go outside?
[36:48.84]No, I have to be 20.
[36:49.26]20 centimeters?
[37:01.75]Alright, I'll probably upgrade here in a sec.
[37:09.45]You should speedrun this game.
[37:10.54]Um, no, it's alright.
[37:15.08]I like just playing this game.
[37:16.24]Alright, we're about to snowball here in about 10 seconds, I want to say.
[37:36.02]Oh, alright, I'm gonna go through the middle.
[37:37.60]Alright.
[37:44.18]Loading.
[37:45.18]Can't.
[37:46.33]Ah, finally we can talk.
[37:47.93]We have a little trouble with loading.
[37:49.63]You can't talk during loading, you know.
[37:52.41]We finally have our voice back, but we can't talk when it first starts loading.
[38:00.76]Goodness gracious, we're sleepy.
[38:02.32]We're just such a sleepyhead.
[38:05.65]You can get to more places if you roll on from here.
[38:09.63]We're very drowsy, but we'll keep it together.
[38:12.39]Alright, we can... I'm not going to leave yet, though.
[38:16.07]I think there's stuff in here that I don't want to... How much time do I have?
[38:19.57]Four minutes?
[38:25.54]These are big.
[38:31.10]All these tuna cans.
[38:32.18]Oh, yeah.
[38:35.83]Alright, I'll go now.
[38:42.06]Oh, I got a crayfish.
[38:46.14]Can I go out, out?
[38:47.74]Oh my goodness, I think I can.
[38:52.77]Alright, I gotta hurry up.
[39:01.99]Everything's a little too big.
[39:03.06]There we go.
[39:04.76]Oh my god.
[39:09.49]I can't get the little elephants?
[39:16.27]Oh shit, that hurt.
[39:20.65]Give me all this food.
[39:23.20]Shit, I'm not big enough.
[39:24.40]Oh well.
[39:51.33]I gotta go speed this way.
[39:58.16]Get it!
[40:02.92]It's 40.
[40:03.56]I'll get it.
[40:03.92]I need to upgrade one more time and I'll be able to get all this other stuff.
[40:14.73]There we go.
[40:15.03]Give me the bottles.
[40:16.75]Alright, I'm good.
[40:23.71]Look at this over here.
[40:24.29]Look at all this shit to get.
[40:35.04]I think I get 50 or 60.
[40:37.94]This dude is never playing Zelda.
[40:46.05]You're probably right.
[40:47.33]You're probably right, man.
[41:04.97]I'm happy with 50.
[41:13.62]Oh, I got somebody.
[41:16.46]A present.
[41:17.08]Oh no, I didn't get... I got a present.
[41:25.36]Did I get the lizard?
[41:35.56]Oh, give me all this.
[41:37.04]I could get so much bigger if I just pick up some more of this.
[41:43.02]Cousin was in the house.
[41:47.40]Your Katamari is as big as 17 of these toolboxes.
[41:50.29]That's cool.
[41:54.35]I missed a cousin.
[41:55.01]Eh, it's okay.
[42:07.23]But I don't know, I might play it.
[42:10.70]I had a lot of fun, but... I don't know, I just don't have a plan.
[42:16.60]You know what I mean?
[42:18.66]We fell asleep with our eyes open.
[42:20.30]Oh, there's a Katamari here.
[42:21.95]Came out of nowhere.
[42:25.31]63 centimeters.
[42:26.61]Makes us sort of sleepy.
[42:27.87]It's not small, but it's a stale Katamari.
[42:30.41]So average.
[42:32.63]We think you can make it much bigger.
[42:36.69]Wow!
[42:37.55]We got a camera as a present!
[42:39.03]Fabulous!
[42:40.23]We love cameras, but it's far too small for us.
[42:43.44]Macho, you can have it.
[42:44.98]From a fan, so make sure you appreciate it.
[42:48.16]This feels like... This Katamari feels necessities-ish.
[42:53.39]Like... What does that mean?
[42:57.41]Oh, it's a planet now.
[42:58.27]Awesome, dude.
[43:27.71]I want to travel the universe in my dreams.
[43:32.09]Play Breath of the Wild off stream.
[43:33.85]Yes.
[43:38.09]I don't know.
[43:42.67]By the way, are you using all those presents from our fans?
[43:46.85]Do you know how to use them?
[43:48.35]You know the birthday cake in the select plaza, yes?
[43:51.83]Go there to put on your presents.
[43:53.27]They'll give you a snazzy new look.
[43:57.03]Yep.
[43:59.79]Little costume pieces.
[44:01.18]If you get a camera as a present, you can take pictures with the prince camera.
[44:04.90]In prince view.
[44:06.28]Take a picture of any stickers you find with the camera.
[44:08.26]Collect a lot to get a... Collect a lot to get a picture frame.
[44:13.43]Oh, okay.
[44:14.87]You can take a selfie using selfie from prince camera.
[44:18.08]Really?
[44:28.72]OK, well, we're going to put the camera on.
[44:32.50]Oh, alright.
[44:36.78]What a video of Zelda being played in the corner.
[44:41.59]I need Zelda sensory videos going on for you guys to want to watch the stream.
[44:44.85]Alright, this one's like a beach level, but.
[44:50.11]What else we got?
[44:55.77]Your Majesty.
[45:00.21]8%.
[45:00.23]Alright, let's do this one.
[45:02.90]A new approach to Ikebana?
[45:06.86]What is Novel Ikebana?
[45:11.16]What does it mean to be new?
[45:13.00]Is newness?
[45:14.24]What is new Ikebana?
[45:17.51]What is Novel Ikebana?
[45:19.33]Am I saying this wrong?
[45:21.63]I'd like to ask your dynamic highness. ...
[45:30.46]We like red roses, the divine flowers, the deadly thorns.
[45:34.24]Oh shivers, oh macho.
[45:37.08]What?
[45:38.54]What?
[45:41.00]It's pronounced... How do you pronounce it?
[45:46.78]Ikebana.
[45:49.34]Ikebana?
[45:51.52]We like roses, so we're all about gardening.
[45:56.23]No interest in Ikebana, though.
[45:59.53]None at all.
[46:00.27]Your Highness is so sensual.
[46:02.57]Sensual?
[46:05.33]Ikebana is too fabulous.
[46:07.11]We think this is the time for Ikebana.
[46:10.90]Off we go to create a new style.
[46:18.72]Ooh.
[46:20.18]Wonderful.
[46:21.32]This is the land of dreams.
[46:23.30]It's so beautiful.
[46:24.30]We are awestruck by the power of Mother Nature.
[46:27.30]Oh, completely slipped our mind.
[46:28.56]How about this much time to roll up as many flowers as you can and make a beautiful, herbaceous Katamari.
[46:37.50]Alrighty, Macho.
[46:38.58]It's all yours now.
[46:39.59]Pick up flowers.
[46:51.98]I wonder how many you need.
[46:53.24]I think it's just as many as you can get.
[47:05.74]Anything?
[47:06.18]I want to get that big one in the middle.
[47:15.44]I don't want to neglect any certain area.
[47:17.64]Really easy to do that in this game.
[47:21.93]Ow.
[47:26.73]You'll miss everything that moves.
[47:31.83]Oh, wonderful.
[47:34.29]It ran off.
[47:37.05]Macho, you silly goose.
[47:38.59]Wait, talking about the... Getting hit by the... What was it, an animal?
[47:44.29]Ow.
[47:58.08]That's good enough.
[48:04.24]Can I get everybody yet?
[48:05.20]Let me see, can I get this person?
[48:07.06]Yep.
[48:15.98]Can I pick up the grass?
[48:16.62]Yep.
[48:17.94]Alright, I'm gonna go up.
[48:28.59]Whoa, that was a bird.
[48:29.71]Okay.
[48:34.35]Sunflowers?
[48:34.89]Yep.
[48:36.77]I'm gonna go all the way down on the other side.
[48:41.49]Alright, I'm going to go the other side now.
[48:53.10]There's a whole entire... What is over there?
[48:56.32]Alright, I'm going to go this way.
[49:02.55]600?
[49:06.31]I wonder how many I need to be good.
[49:12.26]I'm going down here.
[49:18.68]Can I pick up the actual?
[49:19.60]Yeah, I can.
[49:28.11]How big of my one meter?
[49:34.96]You have to roll up moving things before they run off.
[49:44.85]So romantic.
[49:49.37]Two minutes?
[49:49.77]Alright, what about the... Alright, in here.
[49:59.65]What's that?
[50:00.09]A flower.
[50:01.05]It's rather large, isn't it?
[50:02.63]Alright, let's see if I'm gonna pick up more of the bigger things.
[50:12.29]Not yet, shit.
[50:17.84]Am I really not going to pick that up?
[50:20.42]Don't.
[50:20.62]700.
[50:21.66]Oh, a lot over here.
[50:22.18]800.
[50:22.35]Shit.
[50:23.89]Oh.
[50:49.17]Oh, I got to get over 1,000.
[50:49.83]Oh, cousin.
[50:50.25]This is going to be close.
[50:56.78]Oh, come on.
[50:59.66]There we go.
[51:00.00]1,000.
[51:00.02]Nice.
[51:26.98]Right when I get big enough to actually start picking up everything.
[51:35.67]Ah!
[51:37.11]It's alright, I got you a thousand.
[51:41.49]Go.
[51:45.17]Okie dokie, moki, all done with the flower power Katamari.
[51:50.63]Your Katamari is as big as 4,300 of these.
[51:55.17]Yeah.
[51:56.09]Oh, that's pretty flowered up already.
[51:57.51]Want to go home now?
[51:59.77]Yes.
[52:15.74]Passionate love.
[52:16.56]Passionate amore.
[52:19.93]The international message of the Red Rose.
[52:22.35]So fabulous.
[52:23.35]Too fabulous.
[52:25.66]This Katamari is fabulous, too.
[52:27.28]Wait.
[52:27.94]When did you make this?
[52:30.73]One thousand flowers.
[52:32.19]Oh!
[52:32.49]It sort of has that never-before-seen vibe.
[52:36.21]It's a Katamari, but kind of soft.
[52:38.23]A Katamari that dares to wear perfume.
[52:41.35]But we're fairly certain there are far more beautiful Katamaris out there.
[52:48.30]Oh, it's cousin Ichigo.
[52:50.53]What were you doing on Earth?
[52:52.21]Traveling on the back of a baby deer.
[52:54.45]We have no idea what you're talking about.
[52:58.11]This feels kind of flowers-ish.
[53:01.59]That was mostly what was there.
[53:03.84]Of course, it's probably because you paid nothing but flowers.
[53:05.66]I'm starting to see something now.
[53:07.86]There's a clue in this Katamari.
[53:10.44]From here on, I have to find it for myself.
[53:13.22]Yes, thank you so much, your highness.
[53:14.92]Please keep this Katamari as token of my thanks.
[53:20.34]Okay.
[53:21.02]Let's make it a planet.
[53:25.01]I wish you were named Luigi.
[53:31.05]Why?
[53:31.39]A sunflower planet.
[53:34.65]Ooh.
[53:36.37]Probably gonna have some major sunflower updates.
[53:40.65]In the next week or two, I would say.
[53:42.85]Gonna be a major sunflower update.
[54:09.88]Is she growing a sunflower out of your ass?
[54:16.80]Um... Yeah.
[54:18.68]Let's just go with yeah.
[54:23.57]I'm gonna make this person really excited.
[54:25.87]The answer is no, but whatever.
[54:31.30]Cool, okay.
[54:33.38]Let's play with Ichigo.
[54:54.01]Hello.
[54:55.85]Please, can you clean this up?
[54:59.85]Music list.
[55:00.91]Hold on.
[55:02.27]Should I pick a song?
[55:03.15]Register your favorite songs.
[55:04.17]Once you've registered more than two songs, you can set a favorite.
[55:08.96]I don't know.
[55:09.42]I don't know if we can do this yet.
[55:11.04]Not yet.
[55:18.36]The real thing is something else.
[55:20.68]Anyway, nice to meet you, Your Highness.
[55:22.58]You're as stylish as ever.
[55:23.84]I'm a parent with a son in elementary school.
[55:26.31]He loves Katamari, too.
[55:27.97]He likes the rolling up part.
[55:33.83]He rolls up everything, so there's nothing left.
[55:37.61]But his room is a huge mess.
[55:39.54]Seems he can tidy up things in the game, but... Your Highness, please do something.
[55:46.64]I feel this.
[55:49.72]When a game asks me to clean, like my favorite part of the whole game, but cleaning up my own desk is like, nah, nah, I, fuck that.
[55:58.65]I don't want to do that.
[56:01.80]Why is that?
[56:03.34]Why?
[56:03.64]I will spend six hours making sure the desk in the game is pristine.
[56:12.57]Not my own real desk.
[56:17.95]We tidied it all up in the last Katamari Damacy Ichigo, do you even get that part?
[56:25.39]Huh?
[56:26.27]What, the kids' room?
[56:27.93]What happened to our story about cleaning up the universe?
[56:31.08]Did we finish talking?
[56:32.06]We don't care about kids' rooms!
[56:35.08]Actually, I love Katamari!
[56:38.00]Love it!
[56:39.98]You say kids' room, we say miniature universe Did you know that?
[56:45.34]We're very good at cleaning up miniature universe
[56:48.52]Anyway, let's go tidy.
[56:57.62]Weirdly compared to the universe, this isn't cluttered at all.
[57:01.79]But still, it bothers us.
[57:04.35]It bothers our love of order.
[57:05.91]There's this many things cluttering this room.
[57:09.71]So let's clean them all up as quickly as possible.
[57:13.63]We know you can do it, Ichigo.
[57:15.63]Alrighty, good luck.
[57:19.68]Alright, I gotta get everything.
[57:22.67]Hat.
[57:23.03]Oh, ooh, present.
[57:26.13]Shit.
[57:27.27]Okay.
[57:28.49]I gotta get everything.
[57:29.09]Uh, I'll have to come back up here.
[57:39.97]Shit.
[57:42.91]Am I really not big enough?
[57:43.69]Besides, I can only pick up gum?
[57:49.04]There's no time limit, so this one is fine.
[57:51.80]Oop!
[57:53.38]Cousin?
[57:56.56]Some weird caterpillar.
[57:59.92]Wait.
[58:00.70]It's second cousin, L'amour.
[58:03.56]Oh, stop.
[58:04.28]I don't know what he said.
[58:17.13]Ow.
[58:20.63]Alright, there we go.
[58:21.13]Now I can really start to move.
[58:33.10]This one's banging.
[58:34.18]Yeah, this is a good one.
[58:37.26]32 remaining.
[58:37.99]If I do this in under 4 or 5 minutes, I'll be happy.
[58:42.85]Come on.
[58:48.95]Come on, hurry up.
[58:51.82]Back up with a gift now.
[58:53.92]I'll make sure to get that before I'm done.
[59:01.18]Let's head back up.
[59:06.53]Alright, this is the start.
[59:08.67]Give me that present.
[59:11.47]Alright, got a gift.
[59:29.27]I got the character.
[59:31.41]Yeah, I'm good.
[59:33.71]It's the last item.
[59:35.75]Right here.
[59:38.17]Two.
[59:40.71]Shit.
[59:41.17]What did I miss?
[59:41.67]I don't know what I missed.
[59:51.08]Uh oh.
[59:56.87]Something up here?
[59:58.97]Yep.
[60:01.13]One more item.
[60:05.09]Blind, blind.
[60:05.91]Am I?
[60:06.05]What do you mean?
[60:09.09]Where is it?
[60:14.49]Ah!
[60:16.56]Under three minutes, I'm happy with it.
[60:23.64]I'm happy with under three.
[60:34.07]There's a lot of Gua in this franchise.
[60:46.88]Is the miniature universe of my kid's room sparkling with cosmic order?
[60:51.40]Cleaned up, kind of.
[60:53.56]It took a good 2 minutes 59 seconds in 10 seconds.
[60:59.49]But there are no messy bits left.
[61:01.73]But this is all about rolling fast, yes?
[61:04.77]Crispier, crunchier roll, please.
[61:09.73]Wow!
[61:10.75]We got an antenna as a present!
[61:12.43]Fabulous!
[61:13.81]So stylish and connected, but it's far too small for us.
[61:17.77]Ichigo, you can have it.
[61:19.26]For the fans, I make sure you appreciate it.
[61:22.83]Oh, it's Second Cousin L'Amour!
[61:24.81]What were you doing on Earth?
[61:26.87]Nothing much?
[61:27.71]Well, that was unexpectedly honest.
[61:30.59]Oh great, the end of day sale is over.
[61:32.97]I could have gone if the cleanup were done faster and better.
[61:36.41]Oh no, what am I going to do about dinner?
[61:38.52]You can have this thing, Your Highness.
[61:40.54]Why does everybody hate me?
[61:44.16]You're giving it to us?
[61:45.56]Okay.
[61:54.12]untidy planet.
[61:56.50]It's so pretty once it's a planet.
[61:58.74]Hmm.
[62:08.09]Because you are so fucking slow.
[62:10.21]Do you ever think that you're going too fast?
[62:16.07]Do you know what I mean?
[62:17.47]Do you ever think that you should slow down a little?
[62:20.73]Do you know what I'm saying?
[62:25.64]Am I going too slow or are you going too fast?
[62:27.67]Looks like it would be shocking to touch.
[62:32.57]It brings us back, but we don't want to remember this.
[62:34.41]How to say it?
[62:34.99]We forgot.
[62:37.97]Are you curious?
[62:38.85]So then try out the shock.
[62:41.23]It looks dirty, so we won't touch it.
[62:43.09]Okay.
[62:54.43]Bamboo Sword of Memory.
[62:55.72]So what does it do?
[63:00.82]Enough playtime, Prince.
[63:03.10]The king of all cosmos needs knowledge and strength.
[63:06.28]The road to the throne is long and hard.
[63:08.24]If you have time to play, then roll a Katamari.
[63:12.46]Experience the king's memories.
[63:13.84]You'll gain access to more memories as you make fans' dreams come true in the Select Plaza.
[63:19.17]Oh.
[63:19.31]Cool.
[63:27.71]Do I have anything to do yet?
[63:29.35]Study time.
[63:32.01]This is new content.
[63:35.80]Oh, okay.
[63:36.66]Well, I'll wait to do this later.
[63:41.46]This is, what, kind of like new DLC?
[63:44.08]Oh, no, it's part of the remake then, because this game did have DLC, didn't it?
[63:50.81]Old, old Xbox Live DLC.
[63:53.01]Or was that the third one?
[63:57.93]Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me!
[64:12.97]Yeah, I'm just thinking of the explosion from like three weeks ago.
[64:18.66]I want to roll up the brightness.
[64:23.00]Wait, I want to be the new character.
[64:26.99]Where's the new character?
[64:27.69]There you are.
[64:28.03]A lot more.
[64:32.92]And I want to put on some new clothes.
[64:34.02]Here's the cape.
[64:36.64]Cool.
[64:46.97]Alright, let's do it.
[64:48.23]I'm a dog, but I love Katamari Damacy.
[64:50.01]I play it constantly when I'm in the doghouse.
[64:53.21]I play against other dogs, too.
[64:55.85]Woof.
[64:56.41]I was just thinking, can't you roll up the sun?
[64:59.19]I'm sure you can.
[65:00.37]Woof.
[65:00.93]You can roll it up.
[65:01.73]Woof.
[65:02.61]Okay.
[65:08.70]Katamari Damacy is cool, don't you think, Lelmore?
[65:12.02]Really, there's even a dog in our fanbase.
[65:14.66]Doggy play, too?
[65:15.68]How cute.
[65:16.30]Hmm.
[65:18.25]What?
[65:18.75]But the dog?
[65:19.69]What did she say?
[65:20.26]She said, why don't we roll up the sun?
[65:25.22]Really?
[65:25.78]We want to hear her too.
[65:30.32]Woof, the sun.
[65:31.56]Woof, woof.
[65:32.20]She said sun.
[65:33.28]Almost, maybe, maybe, almost, nearly.
[65:37.02]But we are so moved by our canine fan that we will roll it up.
[65:41.04]The sun, anyway.
[65:49.57]Wowies, you're finally here.
[65:51.74]It's space.
[65:52.50]Outer space.
[65:54.54]Okie dokie.
[65:55.60]Want to go for the sun?
[65:56.38]Want to roll the Earth and roll up the sun?
[65:59.96]We know you can do it.
[66:01.54]Alrighty, good luck.
[66:02.20]Huh?
[66:15.67]I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[66:19.25]Oh, it's Cassiopeia.
[66:22.59]We made that, you know.
[66:23.55]I think I can't do this until the... that sun?
[66:36.95]Wait, not yet.
[66:44.14]So this is the planets that I have now.
[66:51.35]Yep.
[66:55.94]Yeah, so OK, there you go, right?
[67:00.71]I definitely don't have enough.
[67:13.44]Oh, too bad, too bad.
[67:15.18]It's because the Katamari is still too small.
[67:17.86]Which means that there's not enough stars in the cosmos.
[67:21.98]Not enough, not enough, so not enough.
[67:25.01]Okay.
[67:29.83]Uh, let's go to the beach.
[67:31.87]Sounds fun.
[67:33.75]Nice to meet you, your majesty.
[67:34.79]I don't look it, but I'm a complete brick.
[67:37.71]Sure I can swim, but my dream is to be a gold medalist.
[67:41.20]I'm thinking the 100 meter butterfly.
[67:43.70]Since I need to practice anyway, let's try rolling underwater.
[67:47.76]We couldn't go underwater in the first Katamari Damacy.
[67:50.78]What do you think?
[67:51.18]You want to roll?
[67:51.72]Yeah.
[67:58.01]Have you never played this game before or something?
[67:59.63]I'm getting tired of your decision making.
[68:01.39]What?
[68:03.35]You roll over objects with a ball.
[68:10.46]It's not like I have to choose who lives or dies.
[68:16.26]I'm literally rolling objects over with a big ball.
[68:22.13]We prefer the mountains to the beach.
[68:24.09]What about you?
[68:24.61]I mean, yeah, I played this game 20 years ago when it came out for PlayStation 2.
[68:35.74]It's been almost two decades since I've played this game.
[68:40.79]What are you on about?
[68:43.78]Underwater, not the mountains or the beach?
[68:45.64]Well, there goes our vacation, Buzz.
[68:59.20]You streamed the game.
[69:02.40]This is a different video game.
[69:03.81]This is... Do you not... Wait, hold on a minute.
[69:06.07]Do some of you think this is the same remake from two years ago?
[69:11.14]What are you guys on about?
[69:16.26]You already did this.
[69:18.82]This is a different game.
[69:29.85]Is it?
[69:30.11]I mean, the concept of rolling up objects is the same, but I don't understand what the concern is.
[69:43.59]Alright, let's go.
[69:44.31]Six minutes.
[69:46.07]We need 80 centimeters.
[69:52.84]Let's go.
[70:00.52]Poisonous.
[70:02.50]Oh, there we go.
[70:09.60]You're a lot slower underwater, too.
[70:20.20]Am I too small to pick up anything down here?
[70:30.03]Hmm.
[70:35.81]The ocean floor.
[70:36.37]There we go.
[70:42.30]We'll get a little bigger this way.
[70:48.57]Go this way.
[71:08.96]Oh shit, alright.
[71:12.88]Reeled in, what a quirky quandary.
[71:15.04]Okay.
[71:21.50]I didn't even see that one.
[71:32.34]Oh my god, I just fucking got magnetized to it.
[71:37.35]I couldn't even move.
[71:44.75]Oh my god, I have no control of the character right now.
[72:01.67]There we go.
[72:09.13]Oh, can I not switch?
[72:15.25]Yeah I can.
[72:19.00]There we go.
[72:32.50]Go fast.
[72:32.98]Am I big enough to pick the crabs up yet?
[72:36.57]No.
[72:48.60]How big does it need to be?
[72:50.60]60?
[72:50.62]100? 80.
[73:07.26]What?
[73:08.08]They're too big?
[73:08.80]I thought I was going to get all of them.
[73:21.63]Excuse me.
[73:23.01]Okay.
[73:33.98]I named one of my koi after you.
[73:35.82]Like the fish?
[73:37.81]That's pretty cool.
[73:40.41]You got a koi?
[73:41.03]Damn.
[73:45.73]Alright, now let's try to snowball this.
[73:57.48]Go fast.
[74:10.00]Give me the present.
[74:11.62]I want that present so bad.
[74:16.27]Give it to me.
[74:19.61]Give me the present.
[74:26.45]Come on.
[74:34.99]Wasting time.
[74:35.69]Yeah, I got plenty of time.
[74:43.51]Well, I can get the big crabs now.
[74:46.61]Alright, now's the time to go get it.
[74:52.73]Okay... Can I get these yet?
[75:07.92]No.
[75:09.42]I'll probably get a hundred.
[75:15.61]I don't like how floaty you are underwater.
[75:23.75]Spin around!
[75:33.12]I didn't get the present, but whatever.
[75:34.42]It's alright.
[75:49.98]Give me 100!
[75:54.37]Well, I gotta... Alright, that's a fine number.
[75:56.73]I gotta... Glug.
[76:04.01]Nice.
[76:04.37]Glug.
[76:04.91]Glug.
[76:05.31]Go home.
[76:16.71]Same number as my IQ, that's right.
[76:19.16]Brilliant.
[76:19.62]A lot of crabs.
[76:32.55]Bob, float and roll up.
[76:35.51]Ooh, we did get a new cousin.
[76:43.59]He's riding the manta ray.
[76:44.93]Okay, cool.
[76:55.14]No underwater skills, I get it.
[76:56.68]I shouldn't have suggested rolling underwater.
[76:58.72]I don't need this brick, Katamari.
[77:00.46]You can have it already.
[77:01.30]They're never happy with what we do.
[77:20.69]That's it, that's it.
[77:47.61]Stop laughing.
[77:48.79]I'm laughing at Mod Chat because they posted 985 new record.
[78:28.15]They weren't paying attention.
[78:29.10]Yes, I was.
[78:34.48]We want to eat something sweet.
[78:36.24]Ooh, okay.
[78:39.02]Pencil and Gretel.
[78:44.95]We love Katamari Damacy, but we love sweets, too.
[78:50.69]Okay.
[78:51.55]Let's do it.
[78:54.77]You should make an album.
[79:00.80]Like a music album?
[79:03.02]What do you want me to do?
[79:03.94]Like, have some of the tracks just be poetry?
[79:12.10]Okay, we actually, it's not easy for us either.
[79:14.66]It's not easy to just sit and watch, no.
[79:17.15]Huh?
[79:17.93]What?
[79:18.25]Sweets?
[79:19.51]You want to eat sweets?
[79:20.59]Well, we want to eat them too.
[79:23.19]Really and honestly, a good idea.
[79:24.31]Now let's go eat.
[79:35.53]Rock Opera Concert.
[79:37.94]I don't know if I'm capable of doing that.
[79:41.06]The Gingerbread House.
[79:42.54]Smells like buttercream.
[79:43.48]So yummy.
[79:44.74]Now we must control ourselves.
[79:49.50]Alrighty, you have this much time to roll up the Gingerbread House.
[79:52.78]Then, once the sweets... Did I play this game like six years ago?
[79:58.23]Seven years ago?
[80:05.13]the original version on like PlayStation 2 for like an hour or something maybe not this one it's all yours now let's go wait I'm gonna get all these these hamburger buns holy
[80:37.74]It's a good game.
[80:39.40]I don't think I played the original one if I did.
[80:42.52]It was probably during like a PlayStation 2 fuckface night.
[80:47.44]Probably only played it for like an hour or so.
[80:52.28]From like almost half a decade ago.
[80:56.45]I don't think it was this one though.
[81:09.54]Oh, you got a... Give me that.
[81:12.38]Give me that present.
[81:12.96]I gotta get big enough to get that.
[81:14.27]Remind me of that later.
[81:36.32]I'll go back and get the rest of those later.
[81:42.58]Oh, shit.
[81:42.90]I just picked them both.
[81:44.06]No, I didn't.
[81:44.42]I got one?
[81:48.27]Okay, all... Wait, what?
[81:51.85]All done?
[81:53.73]Oh, shit.
[81:56.56]No, no, no, I don't want to go home.
[81:59.06]The goal was to roll them up at the end.
[82:00.58]Oh, I'm sorry.
[82:01.24]Alright, we got it.
[82:03.58]Oh, sorry, I didn't read that part.
[82:06.04]We're good.
[82:09.02]I was reading chat.
[82:12.79]Sorry, we'll make it better.
[82:26.29]I'm just going to stay in the house.
[82:27.25]I'm not going to leave this till it's all gone.
[82:28.82]There we go.
[82:50.54]Alright, I'm already much bigger now.
[82:52.34]Okay.
[82:53.66]Once it's big enough... Okay, so it is big enough.
[82:57.27]Am I big enough for the fork?
[83:03.49]No, shit.
[83:04.89]Okay.
[83:24.69]I got two minutes.
[83:25.83]I gotta get to a thousand.
[83:26.63]Come here!
[83:33.06]Give me that treasure!
[83:36.52]What?
[83:39.10]Am I seriously not big enough?
[83:57.04]Get over here!
[83:57.62]Alright, we're good.
[84:06.26]One minute.
[84:07.34]I got time.
[84:21.31]At 20 seconds, I'm gonna go for it.
[84:26.80]Alright, we're good.
[84:27.98]That's good enough.
[84:29.26]1,300? 1,400?
[85:01.00]JermaStream's Katamari Damacy re-roll from four years ago.
[85:03.82]Yeah, that's the first one.
[85:05.50]This is the second one.
[85:06.67]This is the second remake.
[85:19.23]You did beautiful Katamari at the end of 2019.
[85:20.98]That's true.
[85:29.81]This isn't Damacy.
[85:31.03]Because we love Katamari, that's right.
[85:33.35]Alright, they had to have been happy about this, right?
[85:37.59]So here we are.
[85:38.22]This is the sweet Katamari.
[85:39.64]The Katamari that even we could only dream of.
[85:42.00]It's full of sugary goodness.
[85:43.26]Yes.
[85:44.20]Unbelievable.
[85:44.82]Okay.
[85:46.28]I think they're happy about it.
[85:49.84]Wow.
[85:51.36]We got a long nose as a present.
[85:53.38]Fabulous.
[85:53.94]Ooh, cool.
[86:00.53]You wanted to eat cookies?
[86:02.31]Can you save any cookies for us?
[86:04.99]It's snacks-ish.
[86:10.81]We're covered in cream and crumbs after getting rolled up in the sweets, Katamari.
[86:14.54]Oof, we're full now.
[86:15.78]You can have the rest, Your Highness.
[86:16.92]Oh, they're very happy.
[86:17.52]Good.
[86:23.68]As long as they're happy.
[86:36.84]2.9?
[86:37.08]That's not bad.
[86:47.39]Hmm, new.
[86:48.43]Alright, let's pick a new character.
[86:51.17]Where's the ball?
[86:53.09]There's a big ball character.
[86:54.11]Where are they?
[87:02.07]Oops.
[87:03.47]Where's the ball?
[87:05.73]There you are.
[87:07.86]Marnie.
[87:09.06]Alright, Marnie.
[87:09.66]I'll get you some different clothes.
[87:19.46]Perfect.
[87:26.00]Oh, I can only have... Well, I'll keep it.
[87:35.71]What do you think?
[87:38.57]Sure.
[88:06.06]Video games are bad for you.
[88:08.82]Barney, you're so tiny as ever.
[88:11.62]Are you working out?
[88:12.42]Are you boxing?
[88:13.18]Oh, we used to box.
[88:15.42]We just remembered.
[88:16.97]We did beat a rabbit once.
[88:18.95]What?
[88:20.95]Grandchild?
[88:21.61]Like we know what that means.
[88:24.11]Don't interrupt.
[88:24.67]Can't we wallow sometimes?
[88:27.83]Magnificent.
[88:33.05]Yes, grandchildren are sweet.
[88:34.89]Very precious grandchildren are, yes, yes.
[88:37.83]Alright, let's try a little rolling with the grandchildren too.
[88:49.37]Alright, let's roll here, another Earth house.
[88:51.67]It's about time to start somewhere new.
[88:54.92]To roll in the fresh air, to roll with the wind in your hair.
[88:58.02]Oh, we forgot about the Katamari.
[88:59.82]How about this much time to make this big a Katamari?
[89:02.96]That's a long time for three meters.
[89:04.20]If you can manage, that would be nice.
[89:07.82]Alright, Marnie.
[89:08.90]It's all yours now.
[89:13.98]Shit, I fell off already.
[89:14.84]Can I... I'm gonna restart.
[89:20.23]What?
[89:21.03]You're going to roll again?
[89:21.89]Oh, really?
[89:22.73]How nice.
[89:23.13]You know the rules, yes?
[89:24.09]Alright, good luck.
[89:29.73]I fell off too.
[89:30.97]The early game is really important.
[89:32.43]What is going on in this song?
[89:52.30]There's a bunch of car traffic.
[89:54.08]Go outside at 20.
[89:54.80]Get out of the way.
[89:56.24]Get out of the way!
[89:58.12]Get out of the way!
[90:22.81]I think I'm just going to speed across the whole bottom here.
[90:24.65]Ooh.
[90:25.49]I can't get up there yet?
[90:28.39]Come on.
[90:29.01]Keep launching over those.
[90:51.19]That's not a bad pace.
[90:53.15]Loading.
[90:53.57]Can't.
[90:53.69]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[90:57.43]We can finally talk.
[91:00.07]When we were little, we used to box.
[91:02.65]Well, not just boxing.
[91:04.73]We used to study every kind of material art.
[91:08.19]Ballet, karate, pro wrestling.
[91:10.05]It was very tough.
[91:11.43]We were always crying.
[91:13.56]All the memories.
[91:15.48]Material art.
[91:19.08]It's hard to read today.
[91:22.86]Serial arts!
[91:37.42]I can go outside, but I'm not going to go out there yet.
[91:39.91]Hang on for a minute.
[91:47.23]Let me get all the change your papers.
[91:49.59]Let me get all the remote controls.
[92:06.13]Yes!
[92:13.54]Get everything.
[92:15.74]Get the plate too.
[92:17.14]Get the frog.
[92:17.66]Get the plate.
[92:18.38]Everything.
[92:19.40]I'm going to the fridge now.
[92:23.61]Couldn't get in there before and now I can.
[92:29.56]Nice.
[92:30.10]Alright, good.
[92:33.30]I'll go outside now.
[92:38.66]Ooh!
[92:40.08]I got another prince.
[92:41.46]I want to get up on the table, actually.
[92:43.52]I got plenty of time to go outside.
[92:44.80]I want to get on the table.
[92:50.68]Shit.
[92:53.64]Cousin Johnson.
[92:55.17]Stop getting in the way.
[92:59.75]There we are.
[93:01.67]Alright, I'm going outside now.
[93:06.15]Oh, I got the cat.
[93:07.39]I love when cats just watch TV.
[93:09.33]Alright, squid.
[93:30.78]Alright, I gotta get- I have seven minutes to get huge.
[93:47.48]This will snowball as it is.
[93:48.82]We're here.
[93:51.89]Go!
[93:52.21]Not big enough
[94:18.16]Once I get to one meter, it'll be good.
[94:19.38]I'll be able to get pretty much everything.
[94:21.92]Alright, so close.
[94:30.01]Ooh.
[94:32.96]We can finally talk.
[94:34.09]Anyway, one day we're in a real bout.
[94:36.63]Boxing bout, of course.
[94:38.33]Our semi-final opponent was a rabbit.
[94:40.63]Appointant?
[94:41.57]We just missed it.
[94:43.41]Listen.
[94:44.83]It's because this music playing in my ears, both ears at the same time.
[94:48.74]And it's like louder than me hearing myself talk.
[94:52.28]I also don't like to hear myself in my headphones.
[94:55.34]So it's kind of a... It's just all around.
[94:58.74]I'm like speech jamming myself.
[95:00.01]But it's alright.
[95:04.98]Didn't beat the rabbit, by the way.
[95:06.32]You can get to more places if you roll on from here.
[95:10.08]Everyone have a good time.
[95:11.95]Show that grandson what it's all about.
[95:13.73]This dude is faded.
[95:17.27]Fine.
[95:18.65]Dude, this dude is fucking faded right now.
[95:25.75]Yeah, gosh, I can't take the sounds in my ears right now.
[95:30.73]I... I can't talk!
[95:33.83]I forget how to speak English.
[95:37.09]I just rolled up a fucking fat joint.
[95:38.79]I don't even know what English is!
[95:40.99]Why do we have language?
[95:42.33]Why are languages a thing?
[95:43.46]Who made up the first language?
[95:44.56]Is there a reason why we don't all just talk the same?
[95:49.46]Why was there more than one language ever made?
[95:51.32]How?
[95:53.24]What happened?
[95:55.24]How come we don't communicate with each other better?
[95:58.96]Who made the first sauce?
[96:00.03]Alright, actually, I gotta get a little bit better here.
[96:24.76]Got to be 50 to get over this.
[96:26.06]Let's go.
[96:34.65]Move out of the way.
[96:36.49]Stop.
[96:37.11]Alright.
[96:44.83]Five minutes.
[96:56.67]Shit!
[96:58.29]Everything's too big.
[97:02.94]All these TVs are gonna get scooped up here.
[97:05.53]Oh!
[97:05.71]Uh-oh.
[97:08.17]I may have come here too early.
[97:24.88]back to the smaller area that's probably a good idea because I'm gonna be in trouble if I don't although I might get over here it's really easy to go from two meters to three meters so I think I'm alright
[97:58.07]Go, go, go, go, go.
[98:01.20]Alright, there we are.
[98:12.59]We'll snowball now.
[98:26.54]Alright, I'm going to turn down because there's way too many people on the road.
[98:32.99]Alright, what's the best way for me to go now?
[98:36.53]This way.
[98:39.17]PBs.
[98:42.07]I got it all in one go.
[98:55.00]Come on!
[99:03.53]Get everybody!
[99:20.49]Train tracks?
[99:22.45]Oh, okay.
[99:23.21]The flower beds?
[99:26.05]I'm getting hit by the train over and over again.
[99:34.44]I can pick the fences up, that means we're gonna get through.
[99:36.68]Alright, I got one minute.
[99:46.67]Come on, get the houses too!
[99:51.60]Oh, what the fuck is all this?
[100:02.22]Oh!
[100:08.94]Oh my god, the screams!
[100:13.62]Did I not get anybody?
[100:25.34]These things are huge!
[100:30.89]Get them all!
[100:32.21]Get me to four!
[100:33.97]Get to four!
[100:41.54]It's alright.
[100:48.54]I love this game. 3.6?
[101:00.35]Do you do aromatherapy?
[101:04.03]Sometimes I'll... I don't know.
[101:08.54]I don't know, sometimes you want to smell something like eucalyptus for like five minutes.
[101:19.40]What's this in our right hand?
[101:21.11]It's a Katamari!
[101:23.61]Ooh, 3.6?
[101:24.55]Isn't that kind of small?
[101:26.09]No, it's not.
[101:26.63]It's huge.
[101:27.87]It's barely a Katamari.
[101:31.01]You should make a Katamari big enough to make his grandson sit up.
[101:39.00]3.6 is big!
[101:45.48]This feels schooly, too.
[101:51.11]Hmm, it's a complicated Katamari.
[101:56.24]Average Andy.
[101:57.04]What are you... I'm not gonna... What should we do with it?
[102:00.55]Let's put it into the cosmos, of course.
[102:02.59]The Shopping Pluto.
[102:44.43]Jesus!
[102:45.57]I'm so fucking... little noises that are quick and loud to me.
[102:49.13]You've got me fucked up forever.
[103:07.04]Ooh, so many quests have opened.
[103:15.43]What are you?
[103:15.93]I wish we could roll together.
[103:17.39]Just a copycat, isn't it?
[103:21.41]When you make a snowman, you roll a snowball to make it bigger.
[103:25.33]The game just copies that, am I right?
[103:27.78]It must be.
[103:28.96]I mean, it's the same thing, so let's get back to the roots.
[103:31.50]And make a simple snowman.
[103:39.94]Oh.
[103:41.02]Look.
[103:41.82]It's snowing.
[103:42.52]When it snows, we think of snowmen.
[103:48.22]Snowmen are cool.
[103:49.93]Yes, they are.
[103:52.27]Oh, it's Marnie.
[103:53.23]What do you want?
[103:53.85]Hmm.
[103:53.99]What?
[103:54.11]Copycat?
[103:54.47]Katamari Damacy, a copycat?
[104:02.43]Let's get started on a snowman.
[104:04.37]Alrighty, how do we do this?
[104:32.99]See the snowman body here.
[104:35.17]Marnie is going to roll up a head and then roll it onto the body.
[104:40.03]Very simple, yes?
[104:41.43]Yes.
[104:42.44]That's all it takes to make a snowman.
[104:45.44]Wowee is amazing.
[104:46.56]Katamari Damacy is so amazing.
[104:48.66]Let's get back to the basics and enjoy ourselves.
[104:50.96]Joy to the Katamari.
[104:55.72]Just gotta make a snowman, okay?
[105:07.86]Do I just have to roll up snow?
[105:08.90]Oh, do I have to pick anything up?
[105:16.55]Oh, okay.
[105:16.97]There's no time limit.
[105:29.07]This is a great song.
[105:51.56]I turned the volume up
[106:13.64]Is there any little things I can grab?
[106:14.88]Or should I just roll the snow?
[106:29.65]Can I get the penguins?
[106:35.13]I'm too afraid to do it right now.
[106:39.51]Everyone's having so much fun over here.
[106:46.93]Get up here.
[106:52.11]What did I just pick up?
[107:02.05]Now I should be able to get... You just rolled up something.
[107:11.76]It was weird and naked.
[107:14.24]That's la la la.
[107:32.39]I'm going to get all these because I feel like they're good.
[107:40.81]I think we're pretty much ready, right?
[107:43.36]That's the size of a snowman's head.
[107:45.84]I think I'm done.
[107:51.42]If I was making a snowman, that's what the head would look like.
[107:55.00]Bigger than this?
[107:58.05]Snowman's head is not that much bigger than the body, it's smaller.
[108:07.21]Make it huge?
[108:09.27]That wouldn't be accurate.
[108:26.66]but it'd be funny if it's huge well alright
[108:46.55]This is the kind of song... This song just makes me think that everything's gonna be alright.
[108:50.83]You know what I mean?
[109:09.66]Present!
[109:10.50]Give me that present, Santa.
[109:20.05]I got it!
[109:22.39]A present for us?
[109:25.48]A present from a fan?
[109:26.70]This head is way too big.
[109:30.70]I think you guys got this wrong.
[109:33.84]I think it's supposed to be normal.
[109:40.00]It's supposed to be a regular snowman head.
[109:50.23]I think I can almost get this whole thing.
[109:58.60]Roll up everything, dude.
[110:06.03]They're going to be pissed off.
[110:09.17]We're going to really piss them off.
[110:19.18]We don't care.
[110:20.32]That was so quick.
[110:26.04]We don't care if they're mad.
[110:28.96]What's this penguin selling?
[110:42.77]Wait, I wanna take a picture.
[111:06.54]What are you doing over here?
[111:09.03]I'm just making some delicious food.
[111:13.89]You want some?
[111:15.83]No, thank you.
[111:16.49]I've eaten today.
[111:17.43]Okay, come back when you're hungry.
[111:37.96]The sleigh is just moving on its own.
[111:39.24]That's kind of sad.
[111:50.53]It's okay.
[111:50.95]You can have that.
[112:03.69]Oh, shit.
[112:04.23]It's vault.
[112:08.09]No, go down.
[112:19.34]Too big, too big, too big.
[112:21.18]No, I'm sorry, you have to live with this, guys.
[112:22.93]If you don't demand I make it as big as possible, and then start chanting, too big.
[112:37.06]What is going on up here?
[112:37.92]Can I get up here yet?
[112:40.62]Come on, get up there.
[112:42.20]What are they eating?
[112:42.84]Are they eating something?
[112:43.59]What is that?
[112:49.57]Can I get the trees yet?
[112:59.04]More.
[113:01.10]More?
[113:08.42]There's not much left to get here.
[113:09.70]I'm almost at maximum.
[113:25.09]Bro, just create a mass extinction event.
[113:41.65]Yeah, do it!
[113:42.39]Yeah, do it!
[113:43.67]What the hell are you guys doing?
[113:53.32]I'm too big to get any of that stuff.
[113:54.56]Alright, I've gotten everybody.
[114:05.16]I'm not sure I can pick up anything else to get bigger than this.
[114:07.02]I think this is it.
[114:17.40]Can't get the igloo yet.
[114:19.91]I can't climb this either.
[114:23.81]Use the house as a ramp?
[114:30.69]Snow is making you bigger.
[114:34.80]Oh, I see the one you're talking about.
[114:36.12]This one here.
[114:43.50]No, not quite.
[114:49.61]I want to get the igloo, but... Oh, no.
[115:02.96]Still can't climb it.
[115:06.96]I'm happy with this.
[115:08.14]This is alright.
[115:17.55]I'm happy with this.
[115:23.44]I'm happy with it.
[115:27.41]How's the snowman?
[115:28.37]It looks awful.
[115:33.85]Oh, yes.
[115:34.13]Looks good.
[115:35.89]Good.
[115:36.19]It's terrible.
[115:49.49]A snowman's so fun, so much fun, isn't it?
[115:51.99]We just can't win.
[115:53.39]It's 200% more fun than a Katamari.
[115:56.99]What makes this so much fun?
[115:58.41]Hmm, what is it?
[116:01.77]Is it that it's fun?
[116:03.39]Or that it lets you forget yourself?
[116:06.12]Well, we know the answer, but it'll build character for you.
[116:08.64]You figure it out.
[116:14.67]Wow, we got a present.
[116:16.22]Looks kind of familiar.
[116:17.12]Oh, it's Papa.
[116:19.56]Oh, we want you to have it, Barney.
[116:22.64]Oh, it's Cousin Lala.
[116:24.83]What were you doing on Earth?
[116:25.89]Hmm, working on a tan in the snow.
[116:28.89]We have no idea what you're talking about.
[116:32.34]Wow, that was so fun.
[116:33.18]Building a snowman is the best.
[116:34.63]The best fun.
[116:35.91]I don't know much about games, but as long as it's fun, who cares?
[116:38.63]It may be a coffee cat, but Katamari Damacy is still fun.
[116:42.81]Please put the snowman up in the cosmos.
[116:45.61]That's something only Katamari Damacy can do.
[116:48.17]Yes, of course.
[116:50.29]Of course we're going to do that.
[116:51.33]What kind of a star will it be?
[116:53.41]We wonder.
[116:55.35]We can't wait to see it.
[117:04.77]Snowman planet.
[117:07.07]Cool.
[117:15.79]Wait, can't you?
[117:24.31]Do I have this weird memory where you can dance?
[117:32.38]Can't you dance?
[117:36.04]There it is.
[117:58.28]My God!
[118:01.02]What the fuck?
[118:03.30]I can't, dude.
[118:15.81]why I am I'm alright I'm alright I have I have a very very hard limiter on the audio now so don't worry nice to meet you your highness I think katamari tamasi is fun I play it a lot alone I've never played the versus mode since I'm alone and your highness will you be my friend
[118:49.58]The answer is yes.
[118:52.80]My students are all big fans of Katamari Damacy.
[118:54.83]With the King of Katamari Damacy around, they're too excited to work.
[118:59.77]Your Highness, can I ask you to come see the student?
[119:15.06]Like, Carl Jacobs gave subs earlier.
[119:18.48]When did that happen?
[119:20.42]Was Carl Jacobs here?
[119:21.80]Wait, Carl Jacobs was here.
[119:27.13]Really?
[119:27.43]Holy shit.
[119:28.03]Oh, hey, what's up?
[119:30.82]It's like two hours ago.
[119:36.81]Well, uh, thanks, dude.
[119:38.55]Alright.
[119:38.89]See ya.
[119:39.35]Students at Earth schools?
[119:43.07]No!
[119:43.49]They're studying Esperanto.
[119:45.85]We are trepukupata.
[119:47.55]We love your highness.
[119:49.45]Love.
[120:05.34]Hooray, done with studying, perfect timing.
[120:07.79]Alrighty, off to see Bugleberry.
[120:19.40]But this is a school.
[120:20.24]Very lively.
[120:21.04]Looks fun.
[120:21.92]What?
[120:22.78]School is for studying?
[120:23.64]What kind of studying?
[120:25.52]Rolling?
[120:25.92]Oh, we forgot about the Katamari.
[120:28.86]You can only play with the students for this long.
[120:32.46]If you can make a Katamari this big, they'll have a great time.
[120:36.91]We know you can do it, Marnie.
[120:38.49]Alrighty.
[120:39.55]Good luck.
[120:50.86]No!
[120:51.28]I want to restart.
[121:22.25]I think I'm... Yep, we're good.
[121:26.62]A lot of buckets.
[121:27.40]Go in a circle.
[121:37.66]Looks like you can get out onto the hallway.
[121:43.74]Not yet.
[121:47.32]Not yet.
[122:02.22]Whoa.
[122:10.62]Not big enough for any of this.
[122:17.70]Okay, then... I have to go back the other way.
[122:24.10]Yep.
[122:24.36]There we go.
[122:32.57]Alright, I guess we're on.
[122:34.89]What?
[122:35.35]Stop bouncing me around.
[122:38.99]I'm going back in here.
[123:08.00]Come on.
[123:08.44]Oh, I got something.
[123:12.68]Get me on the table.
[123:15.02]I'm kind of glitching through this.
[123:21.14]Cousin Niso.
[123:24.58]Get on the desk.
[123:28.81]Get all that shit.
[123:38.33]A little too big.
[123:39.27]There we go.
[123:40.79]Oh!
[123:44.67]Do I have the camera?
[123:48.51]Shit.
[123:49.03]That's a sticker.
[123:50.07]I can't do it.
[123:55.78]Can I go outside?
[123:59.24]I'll pick the chairs up now.
[124:08.92]Wait in here.
[124:10.62]Look at all this shit in here.
[124:15.56]Can I get the desks yet?
[124:17.87]Get out of the way!
[124:25.71]Oh shit, I'm stuck.
[124:42.54]What is all this?
[124:43.84]Oh, this is all toilet paper.
[124:47.52]Shit, I have enough time.
[124:48.32]No, I don't want to go outside.
[125:10.90]Alright, go!
[125:13.72]Get everybody quick!
[125:17.57]I got 30 seconds.
[125:23.37]I need to go in a different room, hurry!
[125:28.93]Get in there!
[125:40.02]Get in there!
[125:41.60]Get in there!
[125:42.18]It's too- I'm too big, I can't get in here.
[125:46.83]I can't move.
[125:48.75]Alright, I did okay.
[125:56.51]Did you make friends with the kids?
[125:57.59]Want to go home now?
[125:58.31]Dude, they are suffering.
[126:12.89]Is that good enough?
[126:22.17]Yes!
[126:22.77]We counted!
[126:23.57]We counted for the first time!
[126:24.65]Okay, to the Katamari in our right hand, too.
[126:32.20]Oh, Katamari came out of nowhere!
[126:34.67]Go, go, go!
[126:36.03]Bigger!
[126:36.51]Make it bigger!
[126:37.43]Bigger!
[126:39.01]2.5?
[126:39.37]Hey, that's small!
[126:40.19]Nobody can have fun like this!
[126:41.63]Make it bigger and let the good times roll!
[126:43.35]I'm doing this one again.
[126:47.18]Oh, Miso.
[126:50.40]You were wandering around a school.
[126:51.80]Someone's going to eat you if you're not careful.
[126:55.54]Is this the TF2 guy?
[126:57.84]I mean, kinda.
[127:00.80]Years ago, that was correct.
[127:06.42]Is this the TF2 guy?
[127:07.44]You know what?
[127:08.46]That's pretty rare nowadays.
[127:10.74]That you're not asking if I'm the sus guy.
[127:13.62]You know?
[127:14.62]Alright, cool.
[127:17.99]Welcome to the stream.
[127:25.05]What is that I'm feeling?
[127:26.45]Kind of ripped off is how I feel.
[127:28.15]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[127:30.41]I'm doing it again.
[127:40.63]I'm going for five meters.
[127:42.27]I'm going to get it this time.
[128:18.65]Aren't you the put cigarettes out on my dick guy?
[128:20.99]Yeah
[128:42.87]Oh, man.
[128:43.19]Alright, school is great.
[128:44.70]Playing with friends, confessing your love.
[128:46.22]Yeah, that's me.
[128:50.28]Why did you read that?
[128:51.00]I don't know.
[128:52.86]Culture fest, sports fest, graduation.
[128:54.62]Ah, youth.
[128:55.06]We went to school, too, of course.
[128:59.29]It was night school.
[129:00.31]We feel youth was bittersweet.
[129:04.91]We'd remember from the shock of the bamboo sword, but the king never looks to the past.
[129:13.31]I'm going to put on... Hold on.
[129:17.45]I want the camera.
[129:18.17]Alright, you can only have two things on.
[129:26.76]Camera.
[129:29.32]Camera and mask?
[129:31.24]Camera and nose.
[129:35.40]I like nose.
[129:40.06]Don't you eat bugs?
[129:42.02]Um, no.
[129:46.15]No.
[129:46.99]What?
[129:49.23]What?
[129:49.61]What?
[129:53.15]What?
[129:58.23]Good day.
[130:02.65]I'm kind of bored.
[130:04.05]Oh, wait.
[130:04.27]No, I want to do this one.
[130:04.97]I want to do the school one again.
[130:09.60]Where's the school one?
[130:10.26]Over here?
[130:15.19]I have some kids refusing to come back to school because the Katamari was too small.
[130:18.07]I'll... Alright, I'm gonna do this one again.
[130:23.31]I think you'd like Tears of the Kingdom if you played on stream.
[130:25.97]Would I like it?
[130:27.09]When are you gonna do the next Smite tutorial?
[130:40.76]I'm working on one now.
[130:49.16]Smite's still going strong.
[130:52.29]And are there more cartoon characters than gods in the game now?
[130:59.03]Wait.
[130:59.31]I just remember there was like a Ninja Turtles crossover and I was like, oh, okay.
[131:09.10]The Ninja Turtles are in Smite now.
[131:11.70]They added a lot of just random shit.
[131:16.31]Whatever.
[131:17.19]I can play as like Donatello.
[131:19.43]That's pretty cool.
[131:22.71]Alright, so I have to pick up... Wait, this is a different mission.
[131:33.57]What is going on in here?
[131:45.85]This is kinda loud in here.
[132:12.03]Okay.
[132:15.26]Oh!
[132:15.88]I got a new, uh, cousin.
[132:19.90]Huey.
[132:20.82]Keep going.
[132:22.60]Not yet.
[132:56.88]Somebody said, dude, open up multiple streams to get sound echo?
[133:02.03]Why?
[133:14.44]That probably would be annoying to listen to.
[133:27.83]There's only one more person, where are they?
[133:36.58]One more?
[133:37.06]This is two minutes man, come on.
[133:43.15]Where's the last person?
[133:43.97]Shit.
[133:58.06]Time to get out of school.
[134:04.97]Bye now.
[134:07.07]Under 220?
[134:07.47]That's probably better.
[134:15.66]I have this open on five tabs.
[134:17.42]This sounds insane.
[134:25.07]Okay.
[134:25.63]Uh-huh.
[134:29.53]It's hard to judge.
[134:30.70]You can get the students home from school much faster, yeah?
[134:34.16]229, that's really good.
[134:42.04]Hey, it's Huey.
[134:43.14]What were you doing on Earth?
[134:44.10]You were playing?
[134:45.28]With kids, that's a good thing.
[134:46.99]Oh, it feels seeding-ish, or rather, children-y.
[134:53.71]Eureka.
[134:54.07]Okay.
[134:56.41]None of the students would leave the school for a while.
[134:59.33]I think they wanted to play with your highness a little longer.
[135:02.59]So it's not as though you were just slow.
[135:05.56]It's fine to have a dawdling Katamari now and again.
[135:09.42]I'd like you to have this card.
[135:12.08]Is it bad still?
[135:14.76]Two minutes and 29 seconds?
[135:28.35]Hey, look, it's a backpack.
[135:29.35]I used to have one like that.
[135:38.59]Cool.
[135:46.20]Bunch of lives.
[135:46.88]I'd like to win.
[135:47.64]Hmm.
[135:49.12]Okay.
[135:53.46]Nice to meet you.
[135:54.72]As you can see, I'm pretty small, but I'm a sumo wrestler.
[135:57.48]I'm so small that I can't win very often.
[135:59.14]I thought playing Katamari Damacy would make me bigger, but it didn't.
[136:02.01]My Oyakata got mad and told me to stop playing video games.
[136:08.99]Anyway, I thought it through and I want to study with your highness.
[136:11.87]I want to be stronger.
[136:12.67]Please say yes.
[136:22.69]What are you guys doing?
[136:23.81]I just looked over at the dashboard for the first time in like an hour or two.
[136:29.25]The stream went up like 2000 viewers because you guys are opening a fucking shitload of tabs.
[136:33.34]Just in the last 20 minutes, I think, the stream has gone up by like 1000 or 2000 viewers.
[136:35.28]How many of you are actually doing this?
[136:36.22]Inflating the numbers, yeah.
[136:56.26]Alright, so what are we going to do?
[136:58.12]You want to be strong for what?
[137:00.24]Here's the thing about strength.
[137:01.48]You have to work.
[137:02.66]Don't ask for it.
[137:04.50]I want to be like you.
[137:12.06]We see now.
[137:12.73]Yes, we absolutely get it.
[137:14.11]We get it.
[137:15.13]All righty, let's get stronger.
[137:18.93]I keep forgetting to turn the music up and the sounds down.
[137:23.76]We're getting fired up.
[137:24.64]The battle is starting.
[137:25.52]Today's opponent is ready and standing by.
[137:28.09]It's the Komusubi.
[137:36.99]He seems pretty strong, but still... Give it your best shot.
[137:40.11]Give it all you got.
[137:40.87]How about this much time to decide the bout?
[137:47.05]Miso, make sure you roll our fan firm and steady.
[137:51.31]As for you, our fan, eat everything inside and grow nice and big.
[137:55.50]Alrighty, we wish you a good fight.
[138:03.53]Okay, I need to eat food.
[138:06.87]What's he saying?
[138:20.44]I just lost everything I just picked up.
[138:22.76]Alright, let's get some cabbage.
[138:25.10]Can't get it yet.
[138:25.88]Oh, cookies.
[138:28.44]I love delicious cookies.
[138:57.01]a lot right here.
[138:58.59]Give me the fish.
[139:10.26]I missed every single object, but honestly, every single one.
[139:13.22]That was impressive how bad that was.
[139:14.57]There we go.
[139:31.66]Can't get the chicken and turkeys.
[139:33.17]I want that cart.
[139:34.97]Oh my god, look at those raining mushrooms.
[140:17.88]Alright, I don't want to get up there yet.
[140:22.88]I'm not quite ready.
[140:23.86]How big should I be before I try it?
[140:49.88]Shit.
[140:54.86]Can't get watermelons here either.
[140:59.94]I think I can get- yup.
[141:05.10]Good.
[141:05.66]It's a big amount.
[141:21.43]Dude, your view count is fucked up now.
[141:22.99]A lot of stuff over here.
[141:45.49]Alright, with one minute, I'm going to go back.
[141:48.15]Cousin.
[142:13.15]Alright, where is this?
[142:15.51]Where is it?
[142:21.95]Right here.
[142:27.61]Not yet.
[142:28.93]Oh my god, look at all this.
[142:43.27]Let's go!
[142:48.51]Alright.
[143:05.06]You ate well and rolled well, and now you're pretty strong.
[143:07.28]Yes.
[143:07.84]Alrighty, let's go.
[143:09.94]That wasn't bad. 234.
[143:18.40]I'm gonna go to sleep.
[143:21.14]Where is it in the world for you right now?
[143:22.44]We're starting to figure it out.
[143:27.18]What the most powerful thing in the world is.
[143:29.81]Not missiles or guns.
[143:31.07]It's the heart in all of us, we think.
[143:34.25]Of course, sumo is important too.
[143:37.71]Tsukari Moridashi, it's the best.
[143:41.12]Oh, did you happen to win?
[143:42.12]Micro Wrestler Man, did you finally get to win?
[143:45.38]And did you happen to win by roll up?
[143:49.26]Super rolling up a spool.
[143:51.48]You ate hard and rolled hard?
[143:52.50]Yes, we think you worked very hard.
[143:54.32]Congratulate you on your victory.
[143:57.92]Oh, it's Cousin Nick.
[143:59.68]What were you doing on Earth?
[144:01.15]An eating contest?
[144:02.85]That was food as usual.
[144:05.53]Much obliged, Your Highness.
[144:06.33]I finally won.
[144:07.67]I was up against someone fairly strong, but I managed to win by roll-up.
[144:11.03]I'll apply myself and become stronger.
[144:12.63]Work harder so I can beat an Ozeki.
[144:16.13]Oh, it's almost time for practice.
[144:17.17]I'll leave the... Alright.
[144:19.48]We've got a happy customer.
[144:24.78]Welcome to the cosmos.
[144:37.10]Looking good.
[144:40.12]Yokozuna Win Planet.
[144:44.62]Remember, this game is freaking goofy.
[144:47.86]Yeah.
[144:48.16]I mean, it's... What you meant to say is this game is wonderful.
[144:54.96]Very wonderful game.
[144:59.40]I need more presents.
[145:08.40]What am I going to do about dinner?
[145:10.83]His room is sort of cleaned, I guess.
[145:12.75]But it took a while, didn't it?
[145:13.77]He'll be in college before you finish.
[145:15.31]You know, parents are busy people.
[145:19.19]You have to clean up this faster.
[145:20.71]Alright, we'll just go try this faster.
[145:22.11]You gonna order a pizza tonight?
[145:26.07]Um, if you want a pizza, get one.
[145:27.63]Alright.
[145:28.57]I'm gonna try doing this one again.
[145:44.88]Okay.
[145:46.30]A hundred things in the room.
[145:47.66]Go.
[145:55.91]Two.
[145:56.49]Okay.
[145:57.29]Under three minutes.
[145:57.99]Okay.
[146:07.95]How's my pace so far?
[146:09.05]Better?
[146:09.69]He said eh.
[146:36.40]Dammit.
[146:37.94]Too small.
[146:38.92]I got plenty of time.
[146:40.44]Am I big enough to get this?
[147:09.19]Nope, not yet.
[147:11.07]Okay, there we go.
[147:22.14]Seven items left.
[147:23.02]I'm too big to fit through here.
[147:31.21]Two, one, zero, up.
[147:45.49]Where is it?
[147:46.89]Where's the last item?
[147:50.79]Where's the last item?
[147:58.32]Get it!
[147:59.86]It's right here.
[148:00.54]Roll over it.
[148:01.08]Alright.
[148:01.66]That was almost a full minute quicker.
[148:02.88]You can do definitely better than that.
[148:19.11]I could probably do better than that.
[148:20.35]We'll see if it's good though.
[148:25.22]Is the miniature universe in my kid's room sparkling with cosmic order?
[148:29.50]It took 2 minutes and 12 seconds.
[148:32.95]Are you sure you can't be more efficient?
[148:36.67]Shit.
[148:37.45]Okay.
[148:38.75]It's sort of cleaned up.
[148:39.63]Of course it's cleaned up.
[148:40.91]But it's not so different from what I usually do myself.
[148:43.19]I guess this is about it.
[148:45.22]It's only Katamari Damacy after all.
[148:47.56]This Katamari is kind of in the way.
[148:50.02]It's gotta be under two minutes.
[148:58.98]Planet or Planet Dust?
[149:00.88]Well, let's replace this one.
[149:14.70]Mission is hard.
[149:19.12]This game is just as challenging as it needs to be because you can just roll around and have fun or you can try to do the very, very intricate challenges.
[149:28.75]What do you got?
[149:32.71]So you're the king.
[149:33.31]It's nice to meet you.
[149:34.55]I'm almost 89 years old, but still young at heart.
[149:38.71]My perspective is still fresh, but I can't seem to find anything fun.
[149:43.49]A friend told me that Katamari Damacy was fun.
[149:46.68]Is it true?
[149:47.12]Yes, it is.
[149:54.45]Miso's hair is boring, so not fun.
[149:57.51]You know there are options, don't you?
[150:00.19]The afro, mohawk, pompadour.
[150:03.15]Oh, we just remembered.
[150:04.53]We had a pompadour.
[150:07.07]We were the sharpest of the sharp.
[150:08.51]Those were the days.
[150:10.68]What, excitement?
[150:11.66]You want excitement?
[150:12.42]You're talking about a pompadour, yes?
[150:15.30]Oh, it's far too late now.
[150:16.74]Ah, your highness is avant-garde.
[150:23.44]Avant-garde?
[150:25.75]Alrighty, so starting now, let's roll it Vanguard style.
[150:29.53]Okay, here we go.
[150:30.63]Are you winning, Jeremy?
[150:39.80]I think so.
[150:42.64]Mmm, it's so sunny.
[150:43.36]It's a nice day.
[150:46.00]It's hiking time.
[150:47.50]Let's get going.
[150:48.48]Oh, we forgot about the car.
[150:50.10]How about this much time to make this big?
[150:51.84]12 minutes for 12 meters.
[150:54.57]I can do that.
[150:54.95]Alright, this one's going to be good.
[150:58.99]I'm going for it.
[150:59.46]This is going to be a real one.
[151:02.80]This song is phenomenal, by the way.
[151:04.14]And I didn't turn the music up again.
[151:05.82]Fucking idiot.
[151:08.78]This is arguably like one of the better songs in the whole game.
[151:12.04]No, not this one.
[151:12.68]I lied.
[151:13.20]No, it is this one.
[151:15.31]I think I'm making that up.
[151:16.65]I think it's this one.
[151:17.69]I think I'm lying.
[151:23.63]bananas, corn, pigs
[151:51.92]This reminds me of, like, Toon music.
[151:53.50]I feel like I'm walking around, like, Toontown.
[151:58.69]It's an amusement park.
[152:00.27]Oh, I got them all.
[152:20.87]50 not quite I'm not going there yet I can't pick up the bananas
[152:48.90]These things are worth picking up.
[152:52.39]I still have 11 minutes.
[152:53.49]I'm good.
[152:56.91]Alright, let's go this way.
[152:59.97]Okay.
[153:18.80]I think that was fairly efficient.
[153:20.02]Give me that upgrade.
[153:29.33]Here it is.
[153:32.75]Loading.
[153:34.51]And, oh, we can talk.
[153:35.77]Where were we?
[153:36.79]Oh, yes, we used to have a pompadour.
[153:38.70]It's a very cool look.
[153:39.84]Sort of sticks out over your forehead.
[153:41.74]But that can be a problem, yes.
[153:42.90]If you don't do it well, it gets saggy.
[153:45.02]Well, it's mostly about the attitude.
[153:46.26]That's what it comes down to.
[153:50.03]You can get to more places if you roll from here.
[153:52.41]More rebellious, more glamorous.
[154:03.88]Not going there yet.
[154:06.14]Get all this other shit.
[154:14.94]I'm going back in here.
[154:22.47]Alright
[154:57.97]Or I'm in line at a ride at a theme park.
[155:02.37]I gotta come back down this road.
[155:27.45]There's so much shit here.
[155:30.47]Eight minutes.
[155:45.99]Shit.
[155:50.87]Okay, time to snowball.
[155:55.51]I got lots of time to snowball too.
[156:02.16]Really?
[156:02.66]Still can't get the umbrellas?
[156:04.48]I need the big soups.
[156:07.84]Get up on there!
[156:09.12]What?
[156:32.56]Get out of here.
[156:34.22]It's a gun.
[156:38.64]Flowers.
[156:40.88]Oh.
[156:41.02]Shit.
[156:41.36]Not big enough.
[157:05.03]You roll like my grandma.
[157:09.59]That's fine.
[157:10.97]We can all play Katamari differently.
[157:12.74]Alright, now I'm going to go up.
[157:25.18]This is going to be... I'm going to suck up all of this right now.
[157:28.78]What's this?
[157:30.50]What's up everybody?
[157:45.71]All these chairs are going to be so much space.
[157:47.33]Nice.
[157:57.08]Three meters?
[157:59.86]Not quite.
[158:07.71]okay I gotta go back out on the street oh I can't get that
[158:35.52]Have I got the fence yet?
[158:36.22]I don't think so.
[158:56.64]We can finally talk.
[158:57.40]We don't like loading.
[158:58.64]Anyway, we can't manage a pompadour anymore, no.
[159:02.26]We can't handle a hairstyle that draws so much attention.
[159:06.05]Shy and retiring, we are by disposition, yes.
[159:09.51]Because we were young, youth can be very embarrassing, but it's whatever.
[159:13.03]You can get more places over there.
[159:15.43]Can I get the horses?
[159:25.33]I got a lot of time, but it's not going to fix anything here.
[159:32.84]I'm going to go down every road.
[159:35.36]Every street.
[159:42.21]Yep, I'll get those tables later.
[159:53.48]Once you can start picking fences up, that's when it's all over.
[160:06.05]Fences, cars, that's when you can start to really just kind of go crazy with it.
[160:10.57]Alright, I'm going back this way.
[160:23.55]Get it all!
[160:28.63]Get it all!
[160:29.31]These things are pretty big, I'm gonna get them all.
[160:38.37]That too.
[160:38.61]Alright, what about down here?
[160:55.59]I'll turn around.
[160:59.96]There it is.
[161:06.32]Shit, I gotta get bigger.
[161:09.04]Come on, hurry.
[161:19.57]A whole nother section I haven't been to.
[161:26.82]Okay.
[161:30.36]Give me this whole fucking structure.
[161:36.95]Anymore?
[161:37.23]Can I pick all the houses up now?
[161:40.11]Okay.
[161:57.00]I gotta roll over here, back to where I was.
[162:03.71]Cars are very good right now.
[162:11.97]Frees are good right now.
[162:20.75]Let's go, hurry!
[162:21.89]Alright, I gotta get to a different spot.
[162:38.39]I gotta go back up to the town.
[162:39.64]And up this way.
[162:42.32]Hurry!
[162:43.96]Hurry!
[162:50.15]I'm not gonna make it!
[162:54.31]Let's go!
[163:19.00]more houses more houses 18. these are all so big just get these
[163:49.16]okay I'm good I'm good could have been 20 but it's alright did I get a present oh it's right there
[164:18.07]Imagine your house gets sucked up by a meatball.
[164:21.77]Okay.
[164:24.82]So many memories.
[164:25.66]Oh, what's this?
[164:26.48]It's a katamari.
[164:30.32]Once we took a good look, it seems kind of half-baked.
[164:33.51]Besides, the appearance 18.8 is just mediocre.
[164:36.57]A Katamari that breaks on through.
[164:38.79]That's what we want to see.
[164:40.67]This feels... plants-ish.
[164:44.39]That was a little boring.
[164:47.54]It's over?
[164:48.14]That's the end?
[164:48.94]Don't you have to make the thing bigger for the game to be fun?
[164:51.30]I don't need a boring Katamari.
[164:53.86]Here, Your Highness, you can have it.
[165:04.57]Here we go.
[165:05.37]That's kind of exciting.
[165:07.89]It's going to be in space.
[165:13.78]My grandma took an edible and is washing her screen.
[165:17.58]She's freaking out.
[165:20.20]That's a fake story, but alright.
[165:36.08]What the hell?
[165:56.86]What happens to the people you roll up?
[165:57.96]Do they die when they go to space?
[166:02.27]No.
[166:04.37]No, they don't.
[166:31.02]There we go.
[166:32.56]I'm going to play as you.
[166:37.28]Alright, what are the new quests?
[166:44.19]Is this a versus or what is this actually?
[166:45.85]This is actually like a two player thing.
[166:55.53]An adorable pet to play adorable games with.
[166:56.77]Everything about you is amazing.
[166:58.09]Everything.
[167:23.99]Friends are so very important.
[167:25.65]We are everyone's beloved superstar.
[167:27.71]So we can't be a friend to just one person.
[167:31.89]Let's get rolling and find some friends.
[167:39.70]When are you doing the shock collar scream?
[167:42.46]I'm not doing... Alright.
[167:44.64]Why did I even read that out loud?
[167:48.09]Okay.
[167:49.41]Mother Nature's very own zoo.
[167:53.56]Too long, it barely fits.
[167:55.56]Since our fan probably wants friends fast, how about this much time to roll as many friends into a Katamari as you can?
[168:03.19]We know you can do it, la la la.
[168:06.35]Alrighty, it doesn't sound right if I say it that way.
[168:08.19]Alright, friends.
[168:12.97]What counts as a friend?
[168:18.40]Oh, this is the woofing and the meowing one.
[168:21.60]I love this one.
[168:25.34]I love this song.
[168:28.16]That's animals?
[169:00.30]More friends.
[169:00.76]Is it people too?
[169:12.07]A lot over here.
[169:34.77]Did he get the rabbit?
[169:35.97]Bunny?
[169:36.33]Okay.
[170:15.92]I definitely can't get the tigers right now.
[170:19.58]Can't get the pigs?
[170:23.78]Climb that, please.
[170:46.87]Ooh, look at all this.
[170:49.14]Get me in here.
[170:58.26]Shit.
[171:10.32]Get all those lingoes.
[171:12.27]Good.
[171:17.14]I'll have to come back here later.
[171:26.87]What's considered a good amount of friends here?
[171:28.79]100?
[171:28.81]200?
[171:28.83]Alright, I think I can get the tigers now.
[172:08.64]that I hear that everywhere I think I can go for 200. oh I got a present nice these don't count as friends but they make me bigger
[172:46.09]Can't pick these up yet.
[172:47.49]Oh, yes I can.
[172:48.25]Any of the camels?
[172:51.59]Yeah, let's go.
[173:05.61]So many over here.
[173:18.15]Elephant?
[173:22.64]Nope.
[173:22.86]Didn't get the giraffes either.
[173:28.90]Stop walking!
[173:39.83]Any thoughts on Tom Brady?
[173:42.79]Oh, Tom Brady?
[173:51.61]Oh, you mean fucking Hall of Fame, Tom Brady?
[173:58.97]Most passing yards of any fucking quarterback ever?
[174:05.21]You don't know shit about football.
[174:11.31]Oh, cousin.
[174:27.53]This is getting kind of out of hand.
[174:31.88]I have not watched a full game of the Patriots since I was probably 20, maybe like 25.
[174:40.40]I don't know.
[174:41.12]Alright, anything else I'm missing here?
[174:56.19]Climb this.
[174:59.45]We're going all the way up.
[175:00.23]We're going all the way up.
[175:06.21]Can I get the big?
[175:07.09]Can I get him?
[175:08.90]Yes!
[175:09.24]I got 200 plus.
[175:10.48]I got quite a lot.
[175:34.00]Okay, am I missing anything?
[175:34.90]There's a bunch over here still.
[175:37.14]Getting caught on shit.
[175:43.77]I need 250, come on!
[175:50.67]Come on, 247!
[175:51.11]I need 250! 250!
[176:05.43]Oh, you piece of shit!
[176:07.05]Come here!
[176:07.47]Yes!
[176:07.87]We're good.
[176:27.16]Brady.
[176:28.82]Come on, Brady.
[176:37.73]Why did you +2 that?
[176:38.79]I didn't even do anything.
[176:42.19]Why are you plus twoing this?
[176:44.65]I just said, Brady.
[176:46.57]Come on, Brady.
[176:47.33]That's it.
[176:49.07]I didn't do anything else.
[176:54.01]I put like the funny accent on, right?
[176:56.06]That's right.
[176:58.68]Alright.
[176:59.98]Fabulous.
[177:00.74]250 friends.
[177:09.32]That's good.
[177:12.53]We could have rolled up more friends.
[177:16.21]Oh, with second cousin beyond.
[177:18.59]What were you doing on Earth?
[177:20.48]Slumming it somewhere up high.
[177:22.24]We have no idea what we're talking about.
[177:29.89]You think the subtle touch of a Chinese zodiac is the signature here?
[177:34.07]Oh, wow, so many!
[177:34.79]This is amazing!
[177:36.01]Katamari Damacy is amazing!
[177:37.41]So many!
[177:37.79]I'm really grateful!
[177:39.35]Now, all that's left is Your Highness to persuade.
[177:42.36]Will you be my best friend in exchange for this Katamari?
[177:46.78]Oh, really?
[177:48.26]You're giving it to us?
[177:50.32]Fabulous!
[177:50.86]We are so pleased.
[178:04.82]The Evolution Planet.
[178:13.87]Now that you mention it, there weren't any.
[178:15.71]Hmm.
[178:16.21]Swans.
[178:16.63]You know swans?
[178:19.23]We think we remember seeing swans at the zoo.
[178:22.43]Wait, was it swans?
[178:23.69]We're not sure.
[178:24.78]We'd remember from the shock of the bamboo sword.
[178:28.44]There is no need.
[178:29.22]Hey, who are you?
[178:36.84]You're a lot bigger in person.
[178:37.88]I used to watch Katamari Damacy when I was still in my mom's... What did I say?
[178:42.66]I used to float in there and think, you roll up stuff and get bigger, crash and get smaller.
[178:48.21]Kind of like life.
[178:50.77]That's what I thought.
[178:53.33]But sometimes there's not a lot to roll up, right?
[178:59.59]There are times like that.
[179:02.06]So how about trying to get as big as possible with just a few things?
[179:07.46]I thought you were reading chat for a second?
[179:14.46]No.
[179:16.83]I'm bored of Katamari Dimash.
[179:19.19]It's so boring just to roll.
[179:21.67]Monsters, dungeons, la la la.
[179:24.13]Are we there yet?
[179:24.89]Huh?
[179:24.99]What?
[179:25.11]Going to use a new rule to roll?
[179:27.07]Are you sure this is fun?
[179:34.23]Roll according to a rule?
[180:02.55]The rule here is... Make as big a Katamari as possible using a limited number of objects.
[180:11.11]A thoughtful kind of rolling, yes.
[180:12.34]We can't possibly do it.
[180:14.18]We would break this rule left and right.

[181:50.14]It is big as possible with only 50 objects.
[181:54.99]These things are pretty big.
[182:02.15]Let's go look around.

[184:52.04]That's another thing we're not sure about.
[184:54.40]And we have to hold fast, make it much bigger.
[184:56.34]Something's not right.
[184:58.26]This sort of thing is sort of different from what I was thinking.
[185:01.98]Roll it right, please.

[186:52.07]So we're making a thousand something.
[186:54.83]But the cranes got scattered by the wind and it's a mess.
[186:58.57]Highness, can you help us collect the cranes for my friend?
[187:02.67]Absolutely.

[187:19.59]Don't tell me which one... Okay, Jack and Daxter is... Don't tell me if I'm wrong or not.
[187:26.35]Because there's a couple games where this plays out.
[187:30.96]Jack and Dexter is the one where it's like a weasel and a young man with like big hair, right?
[187:45.47]So Jack and Dexter are... but I don't know who is who.
[187:50.27]Is Dexter the weasel character or is Dexter the character you play with?
[187:59.86]Dexter is the... Daxter.
[188:01.38]Daxter is the weasel.
[188:04.38]Okay, and you want me to do an impression of this character.
[188:10.67]I don't know what this character sounds like, but I'm going to give it a shot.
[188:13.51]Can you give me a line to read?
[188:14.49]I feel like I know what this person sounds like, but I don't.
[188:19.58]Give me a line.

[188:56.58]Give me a line.
[188:57.32]If you want me to do an impression, give me a line.
[189:04.16]Give me a line.

[190:01.48]Slowly, all ten of them surrounded me, Jerry.
[190:04.38]But do I surrender?
[190:05.20]No.
[190:06.16]I summon my highly trained killer instincts and pounce.
[190:09.50]Ha, yeah.
[190:10.58]And when the dust is cleared, there were 20 less metalheads in the world.

[192:52.38]Alright, just Love, Peace, and a few other guys.
[192:54.66]Oh, we forgot about the Katamari.
[192:55.88]You have this much time to roll up lots and lots of paper cranes.
[193:01.50]A thousand cranes to grant a wish.
[193:07.64]Okay, so I gotta get to a thousand.
[193:10.20]Easy enough.
[193:11.94]We know you can do it, la la la.
[193:13.80]Let's go.
[193:15.06]Alright, I turned it up.
[193:17.60]I turned it up, everybody.
[193:19.30]I know a lot of people are asking me to turn it up, so it's turned up.
[193:28.72]It's not a whole lot of time.
[193:30.54]The chicken just fucking destroyed me.
[194:18.87]What was your favorite subject in math?
[194:20.95]Uh, logic.
[194:24.03]Not kidding.
[194:25.06]That's a Redditor comment.
[194:38.79]No, it's not.
[194:57.74]How do I?
[194:58.52]There's not a thousand paper cranes in here.
[195:01.30]Is there another?
[195:02.89]Is there an exit?
[195:04.11]Okay, there is.
[195:06.53]Okay, there's quite a lot in here actually.
[195:27.53]Crispy voice today, crispy.
[195:41.12]It had to be crispy.
[195:44.12]Alright, crispy onions.
[195:57.64]You happy you had the onions?
[195:58.96]Are you glad you had the onions?
[196:01.68]You happy you had the onions?
[196:04.95]Don't blame this on me.
[196:06.15]They have to be crispy.
[196:11.85]Crispy onions.
[196:12.64]They have to be crispy.

[197:04.97]Wait!
[197:07.73]You scammed him!
[197:10.02]I just completely forgot.
[197:12.84]Alright, don't worry, I'll take care of that.
[197:21.38]Can you please say it was a bad day for you?
[197:23.62]Hold on, I don't want to lose.
[197:31.14]Oh, this is the room to do it in!
[197:40.06]I'm gonna get so close.
[197:44.18]It's gonna be so sad.
[198:05.33]Hurry!
[198:06.17]Hurry!
[198:12.49]Hurry!
[198:19.41]I didn't do it.
[198:20.27]I'm an underachiever.
[198:22.31]Yeah, it's from Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[198:25.13]They get behind the slow golfer because Larry's cousin, they really want to get in front of the slow golfer, but Larry's cousin orders crispy onions with his eggs, which is going to take extra time, which Larry's like, you fucking idiot.
[198:40.59]We got to get in front of the slow golfer.
[198:53.10]And then the guy fucking dies.
[198:54.10]90%, that's not bad.
[199:02.77]Won't help get anyone out of the hospital sooner.
[199:08.09]I need to get 100%.
[199:10.61]It's Opio.
[199:11.03]Woo, Opio.
[199:29.42]Up to the cosmos.
[199:34.75]What about Clank from Ratchet and Clank?
[199:36.57]Okay.
[199:48.44]Clank.
[199:48.96]Clank is a robot.
[199:51.80]Right?
[199:54.78]So it will probably have a robotic voice.
[200:01.53]But are we talking C-3PO level of a robot?
[200:06.30]And I talk very eloquently.
[200:08.44]Or are we talking like caveman style robot where I have five words I say?
[200:14.38]Hmm.
[200:17.61]Come on, this is important.
[200:23.67]What are you linking me here?
[200:31.05]Looking for 20 minutes.
[200:32.07]Just drop a ball.
[200:32.83]I haven't been looking for 20 minutes.
[200:34.53]You can't hold up the whole course like this.
[200:36.69]Let us play through.
[200:37.87]You don't play through.
[200:39.23]Out of the question.
[200:40.31]It's not right.
[200:41.10]It's very inconsiderate.
[200:42.86]I'm not inconsiderate.
[200:43.80]You're inconsiderate.
[200:44.66]You're inconsiderate.
[200:45.50]No, you are.
[200:45.78]You're inconsiderate.
[200:46.46]You want to do me a favor?
[200:47.58]Yeah, yeah.
[200:48.16]You shove it up your ass.
[200:49.22]Are you happy you had the onions?
[200:50.86]Huh?
[200:52.06]You're glad you had the onions?
[200:53.48]Let's go.
[200:54.23]Don't get angry.
[200:55.13]What are you going to do?
[200:57.29]No, we'll come back tomorrow.
[200:58.57]I come here to relax.
[201:01.00]Are you happy on the audience?
[201:03.26]Oh, that's so fucking funny.
[201:04.56]That show is so good.
[201:13.59]I'm sorry.
[201:14.37]I just laughed really loud in your ear.
[201:16.55]But somebody said I sounded like Beavis and Butthead.
[201:18.57]I sounded like Butthead from Beavis and Butthead.
[201:21.17]Clip it.
[201:21.61]I want to hear it.
[201:24.47]You sounded like Butthead?
[201:27.39]Shut up.
[201:28.67]Flink it.
[201:34.34]It was a great laugh, was it?
[201:41.30]I need to hear it.
[201:42.84]It was the... You have an attitude today?
[201:57.69]Bro, somebody just said I sound like Butthead.
[201:59.85]That is an attack.
[202:01.04]Alright, that's an attack.
[202:02.44]I'm going on the defensive.
[202:06.61]That wasn't that Not even that close
[202:40.29]I'll tell you, one of my most, my favorite episode from Beavis and Butthead is when Beavis sits down in one of those automatic blood pressure machines and just fucking freaks out.
[202:58.40]You guys remember those things?
[203:04.28]He's like, he's like, put it!
[203:05.84]It's squeezing my arm!
[203:08.14]Put it!
[203:08.59]Get it off me!
[203:11.01]You look stupid.
[203:13.39]He's like, he's fucking in, I think it like, he gets like hurt.
[203:17.92]He has a fucking meltdown sitting down in that thing.
[203:29.90]You did the clank voice perfectly.
[203:31.58]I did?
[203:32.33]Well, that's good.
[203:32.81]Oh.
[203:34.33]Should we do honey or... No, I want to do opio.
[203:39.40]I need more presents too.
[203:41.52]I'm really lacking in the present department.
[203:56.97]Alright, let's go here.
[203:58.77]I want to roll up a car.
[203:59.92]What I want to roll up is a car.
[204:05.22]Are you glad you had the onion?
[204:07.01]Are you happy you had the onion?
[204:11.05]I tried myself during a race but couldn't roll them up.
[204:12.71]Give me a chance, please.
[204:16.55]Do a master shake impression?
[204:17.87]I think I could probably do a good one, and I think I did do a good one, and people said it was a bad one, and I was really disappointed.
[204:29.69]You've got some real Cornholio energy today.
[204:32.01]He used to like... He used to put his shirt... Oh my god.
[204:40.89]He would make... Okay.
[204:43.67]Cornholio used to sit there and be like... He would make Popeye noises.
[204:49.74]You know Popeye?
[204:51.96]Popeye would be like...
[205:00.52]It's so childish, but it's fucking funny, I don't even care
[205:37.46]Yeah, Holly's been watching King of the Hill.
[205:41.16]That's a great show, too.
[205:42.08]Mike Judge does a lot of great work.
[205:51.25]Everyone, including the Katamari, will go at the same time.
[205:54.43]Roll up cars to your heart's content.
[205:56.35]Let's see how many... Okay, so I get six minutes to roll a bunch of cars.

[207:50.08]Oh, look at these Super Mario pipes!
[207:51.38]Whoa, it is moving on its own.
[207:52.94]I wasn't kidding.
[207:54.88]It's actually moving on its own.

[209:55.00]So close.
[209:57.10]There we go.
[209:57.52]Get the rest of the cars, and then I'm gonna start picking up everything else.
[210:07.34]Really?
[210:07.60]Not big enough?
[210:15.64]What'd I get?
[210:17.02]Oooh!

[211:02.35]On the big boat?
[211:07.23]Big boat.

[212:12.71]It's pretty fun.
[212:13.19]It was pretty fun.
[212:28.31]Everyone won the race.
[212:32.34]Cars, they're pretty fast.
[212:33.38]Of course we are faster.
[212:35.10]If we fly, we are even faster.
[212:37.46]Oh, what's this Katamari doing here?
[212:40.34]What is this clunker?
[212:41.26]Is it a 3cc engine?
[212:44.82]7cc?
[212:45.36]Let's work on getting it bigger.

[212:57.22]Wow.
[212:58.16]We got a horsey as a present.
[212:59.94]Ooh.
[213:01.00]It's kind of charming, but it's a small thing.
[213:05.83]Hope you can have it.
[213:07.25]I'm a fan.
[213:07.65]Appreciate it.
[213:09.99]Hey, what the?
[213:10.47]This isn't as fun as car racing.
[213:11.81]This sure ain't as exciting as car racing.
[213:15.39]Katamari Damacy was more fun before.
[213:18.67]This is a letdown.
[213:19.51]You can have this thing, Your Highness.
[213:24.26]I almost beat the record by 100%.
[213:26.98]Alright, we're going to go put the music up and the sound down again.
[213:47.08]Let's swim in the ocean.
[213:47.90]The pride of the beach we used to, uh, blue sea, white sand, seagulls, umbrellas, starfish, crabs, seashells, tires.
[214:02.99]Hmm.
[214:03.87]Tires.
[214:06.71]I remember from the shock of the bamboo sword that we have no interest in tires.
[214:13.76]No, that didn't fucking do it.
[214:16.29]Quiet.
[214:16.63]I didn't say it.
[214:17.52]You all thought it was going to happen.
[214:22.18]How dare you think I was going to say that.
[214:27.36]Genuinely upsetting.
[214:29.17]Genuinely upsetting.
[214:31.43]What have you got?
[214:38.41]Hello, Your Highness.
[214:39.61]Katamari Debasi is a really popular thing all around the world.
[214:42.49]Anyway, I'm on a camping trip right now.
[214:43.95]We're having a good time, and every camping trip needs a campfire, but we can't get the fire lit.
[214:50.02]I mean, we haven't had any luck.
[214:52.74]Your Highness, can you help us out?
[214:54.10]Of course I can.
[214:58.50]Da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba.
[215:03.11]long day today home in a hot bath oh we left a fire burning for the bath oh opio what are we going to do huh campfire we have more important issues we must return to the royal castle and check on the fire for the bath
[215:20.10]Patamari is le fantastique.
[215:23.10]Fantastic.
[215:26.54]Think of that.
[215:28.42]Today is sauna day, not bath day.
[215:30.20]That's why we left the fire burning on purpose.
[215:32.26]Okay, then.
[215:33.08]To the campground.
[215:44.51]This is the campground.
[215:45.32]Wowies, we're a little bit excited.
[215:48.00]Everyone else looks like they're having fun too.
[215:50.38]We want to pitch a tent next to them.
[215:51.72]Okay.
[215:53.80]This is the small wood pile.
[215:57.02]Light this by rolling it up and you have a campfire.
[215:59.58]Okay.
[216:03.97]If you can manage in this much time, that will make everyone happy.
[216:07.17]Okay.
[216:13.01]I don't get it.
[216:15.76]Did I get as sick as I can?
[216:50.09]Fuck it, Brady.
[217:17.91]I can't pick up the buckets, but I can pick up the cats.
[217:25.89]Still gonna play Sorcery, you bet.
[217:28.59]Bet on it?
[217:31.09]Oh yeah, bet on it.
[217:46.46]I have a feeling going in the water will be bad, so I'm not going to.
[217:57.34]But I will get the Cinder Blossom.
[218:03.62]Am I big enough to pick the mushrooms up yet?
[218:08.07]Now I probably am.
[218:10.49]No.
[218:14.81]What about Hylics 2?
[218:17.27]Oh yeah.
[218:18.21]Yeah, I'm backlog barrier right now.
[218:24.21]Alright, I don't want to touch this yet, but I will roll over all this.
[218:32.48]Right.
[218:47.33]Oh my god, my eye is so itchy.
[218:51.41]What happened?
[218:52.65]How does it feel to be known as a liar?
[218:59.19]uh-oh I just why did I even look over a chat for no reason fire goes out when you stick it in water you should be able to understand that simple fact please roll with some common sense
[219:22.83]It went out.
[219:23.34]The fire went out.
[219:24.54]The fire carrying everyone's trust.
[219:27.40]The fire that was going through his ears.
[219:29.00]It went out.
[219:31.28]This goes way beyond simple disappointment.
[219:34.92]Think about it, Hopio.
[219:36.40]Extinguish the flames of their hope.
[219:38.82]They don't love it at all.
[219:40.42]They don't love us.
[219:41.45]No, maybe the fire of our spirit is out to ruin us all.
[219:48.05]We can shoot.
[219:50.67]From our eyes are these laser beams.
[219:54.81]Usually it's a much more effective form of spanking.
[219:58.70]Relighting a fire that's gone out.
[220:00.68]It's not easy.
[220:01.60]We're going to go home now.
[220:03.28]Goodbye.
[220:05.48]Oh, this one is hard.
[220:09.40]You sound like Giga Chad.
[220:11.28]Oh, I feel like I look like Giga Chad.
[220:36.94]Dude, did you even eat today?
[220:37.96]Yeah.
[220:45.17]I had a little bit of avocado and a tortilla with some chicken and some Tabasco.
[220:55.94]It was pretty good.
[221:07.43]And a gallon of milk.
[221:08.67]There's the milk guy again.
[221:10.29]There's Mr. Milk.
[221:13.87]And a gallon of milk too!
[221:16.39]No, no, what's with the milk guy?
[221:30.23]There is a milk guy that's in this chat every day.
[221:47.93]We care about your bones.
[221:48.87]I get plenty of calcium, don't worry about me.
[222:13.76]I need to go back to... I need to touch the fire right now.
[222:17.10]Or I'm dead.
[222:25.70]Thoughts on you being a cultural and developmental figure of my life?
[222:30.73]Uh... I hope it's a good thing.
[222:34.93]I hope it's a good thing.
[222:40.01]Oh, that's a good thing.
[222:41.07]Alright, now that I got you here.
[222:45.83]Really?
[222:47.53]Okay.
[222:48.75]Brush your teeth every day.
[222:49.59]Eat a well-balanced diet.
[222:52.41]Get sleep.
[222:53.77]Sleep every day.
[222:54.69]Make sure you get some good sleep.
[222:58.05]Vegetables are not gross.
[223:01.36]Milk is fine.
[223:02.96]Don't eat too much.
[223:04.16]Don't drink too much milk.
[223:06.82]Have some milk.
[223:07.48]Who cares?
[223:08.12]Sometimes you're gonna have milk.
[223:10.68]Um.
[223:10.84]Try to be, like, nice to people if you can.
[223:15.23]I know I can be fucking hard sometimes, but I get it.
[223:17.65]I get it.
[223:19.27]Try to be, like, try to be nice to people if you can.
[223:23.17]I know some people, I get it.
[223:24.72]Some people, you're just like, oh, how the fuck am I gonna be nice to this person?
[223:34.10]Try to be a good version of yourself, right?
[223:36.39]And we all go through ups and downs.
[223:40.49]I'm not telling you to be the best version of yourself because... You need to be... Let me just roll a puncher.
[223:54.59]Thanks a lot, dad!
[223:58.91]you game I didn't even pay attention to this alright if I can hit once I'm gonna delete my Twitch channel after next like six years from now I'll play this again
[224:28.14]Yeah, in six years, when I play this again, I'm going to do this exact thing, and if I get hit, then whatever.
[224:34.75]I almost just went right into the water.
[224:42.49]Is this a baby game?
[224:48.67]Yes and no.
[224:50.51]You can make this as difficult as you want, or you can just kind of roll up stuff and have fun.
[224:55.45]You don't have to take it too seriously.
[225:02.30]best kind of game.
[225:02.98]A game that's just fun to play, no pressure on it or anything, but you could really go hard with this game and be very good at it.
[225:14.50]I typed that three hours ago, dude.
[225:16.26]My connection's bad.
[225:28.96]this is a reddit game what does that even mean anymore that's losing meaning that's losing meaning everything is a reddit thing I think you're replacing that with like alright this thing that I think is kind of stupid this is a reddit game
[226:00.07]reddit chill yeah well that one makes sense to me I'm falling
[226:29.17]I think they mean it's a game for millennials?
[226:37.25]I mean, this game... I mean, this came out when I was... 19?
[226:43.54]18 or something?
[226:47.18]20?
[226:47.22]I don't know.
[226:48.02]When did this come out?
[226:49.02]How old was I when this came out?
[226:52.28]17 or something?
[226:53.20]I need a fire right now.
[226:55.41]Hurry up and go.
[226:56.69]Oh my god, I'm not paying any.
[227:09.46]Can you please remind me to take my pizza out of the oven in 30 minutes?
[227:13.67]30 minutes!
[227:17.75]Bro.
[227:20.29]Why are you cooking a pizza for 30 minutes?
[227:22.07]That thing is gonna be like charcoal.
[227:32.80]It's gonna be a slow roast?
[227:44.40]It's gonna be a burnt ass pizza, yeah.
[227:50.03]Slow roast pizza.
[227:52.05]Would that do anything?
[227:53.21]Okay, let's have a food conversation.
[227:55.55]That's our favorite thing, sir.
[227:57.93]If you put a pizza in the oven at like 250 degrees and you cooked it for an hour, what would happen?
[228:04.96]For like 200, what's... It would be awful.
[228:06.54]It would be terrible.
[228:14.74]it would just be a bad pizza it would be very yeah it would be terrible frozen pizza is gonna be it's gonna be terrible already there are some good frozen pizzas I'm telling you I don't I don't see them anymore they probably I don't know they probably discontinued the whole franchise I have no idea
[228:46.12]Dr. Roker's Pizza doesn't exist anymore.
[228:49.10]I can't find it anywhere.
[228:53.95]That shit was actually phenomenal.
[228:57.79]Alright, I'm not confident that I can do this one that well, so I'm just going to end it soon here.
[229:05.04]I'm going to just go in there and do it.
[229:14.99]30 minutes for a pizza, though.
[229:15.92]That does feel like a very long time.
[229:19.06]DiGiorno?
[229:19.62]If I could do a pizza tier list, frozen pizza tier list, I could probably do it.
[229:25.88]I've had a lot of them.
[229:28.14]DiGiorno's stuffed crust is pretty high up there.
[229:32.40]I'd say it's very high up there.
[229:42.58]I got it.
[229:42.86]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[229:53.12]There's fire up there.
[229:58.27]Good.
[229:58.49]I only have 27 seconds.
[229:59.87]I thought there was no timer.
[230:11.91]just hit me oh my fucking god I didn't think there was a timer did that timer just appear out of nowhere or was I just not paying any attention to the game I was just talking about pizza I think there is a timer okay I just I seriously was not even looking the game was playing by itself I was in food mode
[230:39.45]You know what game actually has a great food mode that we've not talked about?
[230:41.94]Red Dead Redemption 2.
[230:43.94]It has an unbelievable food mode.
[230:45.46]You just have to hold down a button.
[230:54.86]You can sit there and just watch the conversations that happen within Red Dead in the cinematic mode because they just stay on the road if you press one button.
[231:02.73]So you can sit there and you can use at least one hand to eat like out of a bag of chips.
[231:16.51]has a food boat it's called engineer no no that's it yeah I know you know how I know that you get backstabbed every single time you play the game because you AFK standing first of all you put you didn't put your dispenser against the wall and you didn't protect your back with the dispenser the only way okay the dispenser right behind you and the century right in front of you and the teleporter right to your left
[231:40.77]Spy has to jump on top of your shit and then crouch and try to get you.
[231:44.97]As long as you're looking around, it's not going to happen.
[231:48.89]I can tell you get backstabbed all the time.
[231:50.45]Food mode is one of the most involved classes in the whole game.
[231:54.92]Gotta move that gear up.
[231:56.78]What are you talking about?
[232:03.85]We're gonna do it eventually here.
[232:06.55]Because it's like seriously the only time a company has ever made a fucking fun version of this thing.
[232:11.27]And how infuriating is what I am about to tell you.
[232:15.89]Team Fortress 2 comes out with this game mode called Man vs Machine.
[232:21.37]I was playing Man vs. Machine and sitting there thinking, wow, this is going to be a new paradigm for video games.
[232:26.35]I cannot wait until more companies make this shit.
[232:29.19]I can't wait to play this in more first-person shooters.
[232:33.60]Team Fortress is the only game to make one of those fun.
[232:39.76]The only one.
[232:41.28]I feel like it's the only one I've played that I genuinely fucking loved every second of it.
[232:48.19]I've played the other ones.
[232:48.99]They're okay, they're good, but it doesn't even come close.
[232:57.67]Man vs Machine is some of the most fun I've had in Team Fortress.
[233:04.57]So here's what I'm telling you that I'm going to do.
[233:07.21]Listen up.
[233:08.78]I'm going to set up a man versus machine stream or something with streamers.
[233:15.20]See if I can get like five, six people.
[233:18.80]Sounds like a lot of fun, doesn't it?
[233:22.25]I actually have been thinking about doing this for a long time.
[233:30.65]just because of how long it's been since I've played it, and just how much fun I remember it being.
[233:38.19]I cannot tell you this is something that's going to happen immediately.
[233:40.21]It's going to take a little while.
[233:43.31]Not that it's, oh my god, it takes so long to get into man versus machine, but it's something I do want to do.
[233:53.06]Because I feel like, don't correct me if I'm wrong here, everybody.
[233:57.77]You can call me a boomer if you want.
[233:59.09]Call me a boomer, call me a millennial, whatever you want to say.
[234:02.51]I feel like a lot of people in the gaming world right now, or PC gaming at least, didn't really ever experience TF2.
[234:10.78]Have you noticed that?
[234:14.47]TF2 is kind of people go, oh yeah, I've like heard of that.
[234:16.45]It sounds like that's fun.
[234:17.85]Yeah, I've heard of that.
[234:18.84]I mean, you've heard of it?
[234:21.36]You've only heard of it?
[234:22.26]Have you played it?
[234:24.66]Oh, not for very long.
[234:27.82]Man, really?
[234:30.21]I feel like it was kind of its own era.
[234:36.65]Oh.
[234:39.92]but I'm I thought I I'm kind of getting the itch to not necessarily I don't know not to play Team Fortress again I really don't think that's gonna happen but man versus machine I've been itching to play it alright I'm just gonna turn this in now never played it never played alright you know you know what let's do a real like not no joking around no fucking around right now
[235:03.82]mods run a poll how many of you here have played Team Fortress 2 for more than three hours like you've played it for more than a few hours how many people here have done that more than a few hours like let's go with five hours because I feel like that's a good amount of time to be like okay I'm not playing the game and I'm gonna lose yeah if you've played for over five hours like alright
[235:46.06]is I think will go down in history as the single greatest thing to ever be on the shelf I don't think people understood back in the day of of everything has to be monetized everything has to be separated and monetized everything has to be worth they spend tons of money on it the orange box was like five fucking full games in one box
[236:09.98]And they just were like, yeah, have it.
[236:11.24]We don't even give a shit.
[236:13.10]Have all these genre-defining experiences in the same fucking box.
[236:19.66]At least three of those things in the orange box were genre-defining experiences.
[236:24.68]And it's all in the same box.
[236:28.80]So 60% of you.
[236:31.35]That means 40% of you have not really played Team Fortress 2 more than a few hours, probably.
[236:38.24]That's pretty remarkable, honestly.
[236:43.10]Now TF2 is... I want to say they want to do... Oh, we're going to fix stuff and do updates and stuff.
[236:49.38]I haven't paid that much attention to it.
[236:56.85]I just know that they were doing stuff.
[236:59.75]Like, oh, we are going to do some updates and try to do some fixing and change this and get rid of that and...
[237:12.30]I have to imagine at this point.
[237:15.16]It's so old now.
[237:18.83]And I don't know if the money is there for them to kind of do like a TF2 remaster or something.
[237:23.45]You don't even really need to.
[237:24.95]I feel like that game still holds up.
[237:27.87]Isn't that weird?
[237:30.71]That game is so old.
[237:36.75]But still holds up.
[237:44.06]Port it to Source 2.
[237:46.20]We thought they were going to do that.
[237:47.71]Years and years ago.
[237:48.67]It just never happened.
[238:01.64]We got a mushroom as a present.
[238:04.74]We really hate mushrooms.
[238:06.08]Opioid.
[238:06.52]You can have it.
[238:07.10]I'm a fan.
[238:08.60]Make sure you appreciate it.
[238:10.74]Oh, it's second cousin Kinoko.
[238:13.67]What were you doing on Earth?
[238:15.11]Hmm, dancing with a grandpa?
[238:16.73]Oh, okay.
[238:24.48]Every time TF2 is going to do... This doesn't feel the same, does it?
[238:29.70]Remember when TF2 was going to do a huge update and they were going to add a ton of shit and people had no idea what it was going to be?
[238:34.66]I guess maybe Fortnite still kind of does that, don't they?
[238:37.36]Where it's like, hey, here comes something huge.
[238:40.72]There's a ton of new shit in this.
[238:43.90]Does it still hit as hard as it did back then?
[238:50.68]Tell me the truth.
[238:56.62]What's your TF2 blunt rotation?
[238:58.58]Engineer.
[238:59.38]Spy.
[239:01.04]Heavy.
[239:02.96]Pyro.
[239:06.68]Engineer, Heavy, Spy, Pyro.
[239:15.14]What about the Demoman?
[239:16.82]What, you don't... I want to go out drinking with the Demoman.
[239:19.90]What are you talking about?
[239:23.01]No, I... And by the way, my... It's... Yeah.
[239:37.83]Sorry.
[239:42.21]He's definitely already thought about this.
[239:48.12]What about the scout?
[239:49.70]No, no, no.
[239:52.02]No, the scout's gonna take, like, the scout's gonna take, like, like a puff and just start fucking freaking out and yelling about aliens and stuff.
[240:01.46]Like, he's gonna be, he's gonna talk about how the aliens are coming through the walls and shit.
[240:03.90]No, it's gonna be like, oh, man.
[240:04.86]Okay.
[240:12.39]That's literally you.
[240:14.25]Yeah, well, you gotta put up with me, alright?
[240:17.09]That's how it works.
[240:26.25]That's just you.
[240:27.03]Yeah, well...
[240:38.47]Nightmare blunt rotation.
[240:40.34]That's such a funny term.
[240:42.34]I know exactly what it means, too.
[240:45.94]It's so stupid.
[240:48.20]Save the pandas!
[240:50.28]Okay.
[240:51.44]Support a good cause today.
[240:52.44]Save the red pandas.
[240:53.36]Unless we step in, red pandas will turn into regular pandas.
[240:58.64]They need to eat yummy strawberries or they turn into regular pandas.
[241:01.70]Okay.
[241:11.93]OK, we need your support.
[241:21.25]Yo, you have any idea who came up with the first sauce?
[241:26.60]Something else jumped up there recently.
[241:28.12]And it was a really detailed conversation.
[241:30.94]I forget what it was.
[241:31.60]What does this person say?
[241:41.85]Irma, Vinny, Joel, Northernlion is ideal blunt rotation.
[241:46.97]True.
[241:48.47]True.
[241:49.17]True.
[242:12.24]Is sauce a solid or a liquid?
[242:15.48]Uh, it's neither.
[242:17.46]It's a gas.
[242:19.39]Okay, let's go.
[242:21.07]Why did I skip all that?
[242:21.85]That was, like, kind of interesting.
[242:28.71]Mmm, so good.
[242:29.58]Chocolate.
[242:30.20]We want to have some.
[242:31.72]Oh, the red pandas.
[242:32.38]Yes, of course.
[242:33.64]This much time to roll up a bunch of things.
[242:36.70]Katamari should be able to save the red pandas.
[242:39.55]We don't know a thing about Earth money, but we're sure you can do it.
[242:43.45]Alrighty.
[242:48.70]Life.
[242:49.58]Absolutely priceless.
[242:57.52]So I have to get chocolates or is it just that was just for fun?
[243:09.34]Every time somebody writes this, I have to say it.
[243:11.66]And it's annoying that I have to.
[243:18.33]Expensive things.
[243:19.31]I got it.
[243:21.05]It's meat.
[243:21.85]Ham is expensive.
[243:27.22]Rotractors are expensive.
[243:29.68]Diamonds are expensive.
[243:33.80]Blenders are expensive.
[243:34.86]$27 for a blender.
[243:40.09]Where'd you get that kind of deal?
[243:42.40]Hey, did you take your burnt-ass pizza out of the oven yet?
[243:53.69]I'm reminding you.
[244:12.44]Well, dude, don't... You really... You don't... Do you... No, you don't do that.
[244:18.80]What is happening right now?
[244:23.70]Ooh, another diamond.
[244:31.36]Expensive.
[244:31.78]Oh, shoes.
[244:33.78]150.
[244:33.90]Trophy.
[244:34.14]Expensive.
[244:41.52]Thousand.
[244:42.52]Alright, cash register.
[244:50.12]Cool.
[244:54.03]Will there be any Katamari spoilers this stream?
[244:56.49]A ton.
[245:01.47]Way too many.
[245:02.74]I don't think you should stick around.
[245:10.07]Oh, they're not happy that you did that.
[245:11.96]Okay.
[245:20.00]Oh!
[245:20.12]Alright, 14,000.
[245:25.84]Hero's cap?
[245:29.51]Could you please play Magic the Gathering?
[245:33.31]That would be the worst stream I've ever done.
[245:37.43]Look at that little frog!
[245:40.52]Hello, Mr. Toad.
[245:48.01]How expensive is it?
[245:48.67]Oh, it's a washing machine.
[245:52.05]Roast pork.
[245:53.05]Only 50 bucks.
[245:53.87]Alright, hold on.
[245:55.75]Telephones.
[245:56.65]These should be good.
[245:57.13]Alright.
[246:19.72]20 grand, I can get to 20, right?
[246:26.82]17,000.
[246:26.94]Guitars are expensive.
[246:31.50]Uh.
[246:33.49]Uh.
[246:36.97]Get me to 10.
[246:37.35]This is like golden shit.
[246:41.35]Here we go. 21,000.
[246:53.42]$21,000.
[246:54.20]Can you please do a Dennis Reynolds impression?
[247:01.32]I'm on my knees.
[247:07.00]I don't... I don't think so.
[247:08.74]A labor of love, carefully rolled by Opio.
[247:16.47]I wonder how many strawberries we could buy with this Katamari.
[247:19.23]Mmm.
[247:21.89]Okay.
[247:25.23]Whoa, $21,676 pretending to be all surprised, but actually we are totally clueless.
[247:32.13]So is this a lot?
[247:36.62]Oh, it's second cousin Odeon.
[247:38.90]What were you doing on Earth?
[247:40.02]Hmm, helping out at a rummage sale?
[247:43.30]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[247:45.94]Okay.
[247:49.43]There's not a lot there.
[247:50.27]That's not much.
[247:51.11]We may have to settle for black and white pandas, but it's the thought that counts.
[247:56.50]I appreciate the thought, so I'll just take $2.50.
[247:58.14]You can have the rest.
[247:59.14]$21,000 is not a lot of money.
[247:59.78]What the heck?
[248:20.35]Familiar Venus.
[248:23.56]$21,000 worth of strawberries.
[248:24.30]That's a lot of strawberries.
[248:28.30]A Bible stream would be amazing.
[248:32.12]No, it wouldn't.
[248:33.08]You think it would be.
[248:35.99]You have this thing in your head of that being so funny.
[248:40.33]But I'm telling you, it won't be.
[248:46.38]I assure you it will not be.
[248:56.30]Oh, I want this mushroom character.
[249:00.28]Cool.
[249:02.16]Sweet.
[249:02.34]Hey, I'm a bird.
[249:04.96]That's right.
[249:05.38]I'm a bird.
[249:05.84]I love Katamari Damacy.
[249:07.62]I've played it till my feathers fell out.
[249:09.54]While I play, I think.
[249:11.41]Gosh, if only I were that big.
[249:13.77]What?
[249:14.07]I have it wrong?
[249:15.23]You can be big inside?
[249:17.09]Oh, that's true.
[249:18.33]Being big inside, it's all about heart.
[249:20.87]Please, good king, won't you let me roll?
[249:31.44]Please do a Patrick Bateman impression.
[249:38.31]What is it?
[249:39.13]Okay.
[249:40.63]Every morning I put stuff on my face and then I peel it off and it's a nice skin peel.
[249:47.99]Makes me feel good.
[249:48.95]Makes me feel good about everything.
[249:50.44]And then I go to work with my suit on.
[249:52.92]Who cares?
[250:02.51]That was Woody Allen?
[250:06.31]I go to work and I put my suit on.
[250:10.28]And I'm telling you.
[250:24.60]Can you do a cat impression?
[250:26.52]Maybe.
[250:34.57]Now do Jesse Pinkman.
[250:37.23]Mr. White.
[250:53.08]Dude, where are the three stooges in Fortnite?
[250:54.78]That's what I've been saying for years.
[250:59.95]For years, I've been saying that.
[251:07.13]Okay.
[251:08.39]Anyway, 17 minutes.
[251:09.91]To get to 500 meters.
[251:13.43]Oh, shit.
[251:39.41]There's plenty of time.
[251:40.25]Can you apologize for that please?
[251:45.54]No.
[251:48.67]I'm sorry.
[251:50.13]Well, I've apologized.
[251:51.63]Oh, yeah.
[251:52.25]Whoops.
[251:53.25]I'm apologizing for not saying something.
[251:55.65]I don't know what that was.
[251:56.47]You know that.
[251:56.92]Whatever.
[251:59.02]Like, sorry, I'm not apologizing.
[252:00.84]Sorry.
[252:01.66]That's what that context was.
[252:08.58]Sorry, I did the sorry, not sorry.
[252:11.16]Racist.
[252:12.48]He didn't one bite.
[252:13.92]Who cares?
[252:15.34]We're fucking crazy over here at races.
[252:19.17]Oh, whole thing in one bite?
[252:20.71]In the wrapper?
[252:21.47]What are you talking about?
[252:24.53]He must have lost your mind.
[252:27.04]Reese is not sorry at all, ever.
[252:47.74]Can you do a Vince McMahon impression?
[252:49.16]Yeah.
[252:51.49]There you go.
[252:52.31]He's wicked red.
[252:52.73]There.
[253:20.29]Can you do an impression of my dad?
[253:21.51]Yeah.
[253:24.45]Hey, son.
[253:25.53]Poor daughter.
[253:26.01]How are you?
[253:27.61]It's me, dad.
[253:29.57]Just got back from work.
[253:30.93]Checking on you.
[253:31.47]How you doing in there?
[253:33.05]Okay.
[253:35.03]Oh, checking out some Katamari Damacy.
[253:36.96]Okay.
[253:38.02]Okay.
[253:40.18]Well, hey, Jim.
[253:42.42]Just seeing how you're doing in your science projects.
[253:46.00]We've done this like a thousand times already.
[253:47.66]I'm cutting it off.
[253:50.64]The next one is going to be Goku.
[253:52.94]We've done this before.
[253:53.98]We've been here before many times.
[253:58.91]You're going to say Mr. Satan right now.
[254:02.13]And then I'm going to do Mr. Satan.
[254:04.83]And you're all going to clap.
[254:08.27]We've done this show before.
[254:11.96]Well, I mean, alright.
[254:14.70]Do what you're good at, right?
[254:16.78]Do what you know.
[254:17.34]Well, alright.
[254:19.39]It's time for me to do Mr. Satan over here.
[254:25.49]And then it's going to be Dutch.
[254:28.06]And then we do Dutch.
[254:29.18]And then, well, I tell you Arthur, you need to get out of here.
[254:34.66]And then of course we do Dutch.
[254:36.28]And then that turns into Freddy Krueger.
[254:38.65]We've done this so many fucking times.
[254:40.09]Bill Murray?
[254:41.33]Do Bill Murray?
[254:42.07]Okay.
[254:44.85]Okay.
[254:46.49]Shit.
[254:46.81]Hold on.
[254:47.45]I'm going to do it off stream for a second.
[254:56.64]Okay.
[254:59.25]This is toast!
[255:01.99]Who can do Bill Murray?
[255:16.86]Somebody just wrote, sucks.
[255:27.96]Do it, do it, do the same like six impressions you do every stream.
[255:34.67]Is it new every time for you?
[255:36.21]Can I ask that?
[255:36.93]Is it new every time for you?
[255:39.37]How does it feel?
[255:40.39]Is it new each time?
[255:54.96]It's not a bad pace.
[255:58.34]It actually probably is.
[256:10.19]Was wasted like 15 straight seconds doing that.
[256:12.85]Alright, where have I not been?
[256:18.36]I gotta go this way.
[256:22.94]Yeah, once you start getting fences, that's when it all hell breaks loose.
[256:45.73]Pizza's ready?
[256:50.57]Alright.
[256:53.73]I hope it's good.
[256:55.15]I hope you actually didn't do that.
[256:57.32]Sounds fucking heinous.
[257:02.86]Most pizzas are like 12 minutes or lower.
[257:06.04]But like 15 minutes total?
[257:12.14]It's been so long since we've had an Aaron, please.
[257:14.08]No, I retired that one.
[257:18.15]Yeah.
[257:21.03]It's a deep dish pizza.
[257:22.71]Oh, maybe that's different.
[257:29.53]Alright, I got 12 minutes.
[257:38.91]And start getting cars.
[257:52.82]Pizza review time.
[258:00.19]I would love to just do food review stuff.
[258:02.31]I think it'd be fun.
[258:17.64]Food review would be fun.
[258:19.78]Remember the tier list stream where I just... Was I full of shit or not?
[258:22.52]That was... I liked that a lot.
[258:23.64]This one.
[258:33.91]What the hell is going on in here?
[258:36.81]What is going on?
[258:42.31]Super good farm spot right there.
[258:55.39]Alright, when's the next upgrade?
[258:56.31]I think I can do nothing else here.
[259:00.80]Let's go over here.
[259:01.60]Hurry up.
[259:09.90]Well, shit.
[259:25.13]Water.
[259:27.25]What am I doing?
[259:29.03]Oh my goodness, what have I done?
[259:30.50]I've ruined everything.
[259:34.96]I've ruined everything.
[259:35.58]Where am I going?
[259:40.36]Why is there a car under here?
[259:41.69]I need to get a better view.
[259:45.53]I need to see where I'm going here.
[259:48.17]Back that way.
[260:00.56]How do I get back to the other place I just was?
[260:02.08]Here we go.
[260:11.83]There we go.
[260:12.47]Okay.
[260:15.90]Finally, we can talk.
[260:17.54]We have a little trouble with loading.
[260:19.17]Well, a touch of boredom has something to do with it.
[260:21.19]We are bored of being us.
[260:22.65]Bored with the king thing.
[260:24.17]For now, we could shave off our beard, maybe.
[260:26.53]What else?
[260:28.21]We could get our hair permed.
[260:29.95]Could be a makeover.
[260:31.96]That's kind of important.
[260:32.98]Perms are nice.
[260:34.24]Yes, pretty nice.
[260:36.42]We can get to more places now.
[260:39.36]Not yet.
[260:40.68]I have to capitalize on this because I kind of really screwed up.
[260:51.04]Too big?
[260:51.42]Alright, capitalize.
[260:57.70]Capitalize!
[261:00.16]Capitalize on it!
[261:02.02]You're not capitalizing!
[261:03.21]Capitalize!
[261:18.14]All these fishes.
[261:43.16]Come on hurry up.
[261:44.48]I like eight minutes.
[261:45.12]Oh
[261:54.12]How did I perfectly get stuck under here?
[261:58.88]Where am I?
[262:05.85]Bad time loss.
[262:07.29]Oh, I know that this is a disaster at this point.
[262:15.50]Why do you keep going in the water?
[262:16.36]Because I'm spinning and there's a ton of forward momentum and I can't stop.
[262:20.81]It's my fault for doing that.
[262:24.37]Alright, I think I can make all this up.
[262:30.91]I step alright.
[262:33.06]Go.
[262:33.56]I'm about to be able to start picking up the big trees.
[262:42.64]Alright, I gotta go to the next area.
[263:01.85]How much of this can I pick up yet?
[263:03.43]Nothing?
[263:07.54]Oh, shit.
[263:08.22]I can get some of them.
[263:16.72]There we go.
[263:20.40]Alright.
[263:22.17]Go!
[263:23.03]Is that Stonehenge?
[263:44.26]There are people inside of these buildings.
[263:48.21]Model town.
[263:49.15]Alright, I just picked up almost this whole parking lot.
[264:11.62]Is this the?
[264:12.06]It's like the Taj Mahal or something.
[264:16.99]These are all landmarks.
[264:27.75]I can get most of these buildings now, can't I?
[264:35.00]Small islands?
[264:36.34]Not yet.
[264:43.68]Whoa!
[264:50.11]I need more of this.
[264:52.57]I'm gonna run out of time.
[265:00.91]What was I doing?
[265:01.67]Can I get the elephant?
[265:10.74]Yep.
[265:21.27]Okay.
[265:23.49]Let's go.
[265:24.11]Oh!
[265:26.21]I can now go over there.
[265:29.05]Alright.
[265:34.70]Oh, it's London!
[265:42.80]New York!
[265:55.88]Tattoo of Liberty.
[265:58.20]What's this?
[266:04.65]I'm so big and I'm just like lumbering around.
[266:07.33]Shit, I'm going too slow.
[266:33.95]85 Holy shit, I just picked it up.
[266:45.58]Alright.
[266:45.84]Alright.
[266:46.10]We're good.
[266:46.32]We're good
[267:02.98]I got the ferris wheel.
[267:04.00]I can't get the bridge yet.
[267:10.42]No.
[267:11.43]Get out of this.
[267:12.87]Oh, come on.
[267:13.41]Don't do this.
[267:19.61]I'm going to run out of time.
[267:20.51]No.
[267:39.66]Go to that next area.
[267:40.46]I don't even know where the next area is.
[267:45.58]I'm so big.
[267:48.14]Where was it?
[267:59.46]It was next to New York.
[268:12.18]I don't think I'm going to do it.
[268:12.86]It's going to be really, actually really tight.
[268:25.15]Oh, I'm so slow and so heavy.
[268:26.87]I move so slowly.
[268:42.37]Two minutes.
[268:42.79]I can start getting the islands now.
[268:49.10]Start picking shit up.
[268:50.34]Hurry.
[268:50.70]500.
[268:51.34]No way.
[268:54.74]Was I just dicking around for like 10 minutes?
[268:58.36]How am I so small?
[269:03.16]What do we do?
[269:03.52]Did I pause for eight minutes and talk about like fucking how much I like pickles like sour or better than dill or whatever?
[269:25.81]Alright, I'm doing it again.
[269:34.51]I'm restarting.
[269:38.28]I'm gonna restart.
[269:40.02]This is a good one.
[269:40.56]I wanted to make this one right.
[269:52.25]Nah, this one doesn't count.
[269:52.93]This is a warm-up.
[269:53.41]Nah, this is a warm-up.
[270:02.00]Because I didn't do it.
[270:03.64]Alright, I'm going to pay attention.
[270:11.65]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[270:12.51]I'm going to get to 500 really quickly.
[270:17.08]Oh wait, change the music.
[270:21.46]I'll put a different track on.
[270:35.25]Okay.
[270:35.43]So what do you want for a song?
[270:39.28]Katamari on the Rocks.
[270:42.92]Fluffing Spirits.
[270:43.68]Scorching Savannah.
[270:45.30]Baby Universe.
[270:46.26]What do you want?
[270:46.76]I'm going to have to listen to this like five times.
[271:06.79]Everlasting love.
[271:09.07]You got it.
[271:10.69]Alright, I'm going to get locked in now.
[271:16.12]Let's go.
[271:36.93]What a great start that was.
[271:39.05]Better.
[272:09.89]I want to get these fences.
[272:44.77]It's not bad.
[273:23.17]the boxer and the matador people are putting essays in chat I don't know what they say turn it up oh sorry now it's turned up
[273:55.97]Right down here.
[273:58.45]Okay.
[274:00.09]Pigs!
[274:28.01]Oh, that's not good.
[274:31.53]What happened?
[274:36.05]It's alright.
[274:37.27]This is actually fucking awful.
[274:57.66]I should not be here right now.
[274:58.92]That was such a bad move.
[275:01.78]I didn't realize I was going to get stuck in there.
[275:03.94]I have to restart.
[275:04.80]This is actually the worst possible thing that could have happened.
[275:19.38]That was a full minute that was just removed.
[275:21.34]It's so important at the late game.
[275:25.90]Oh, this is shit RNG too.
[275:27.42]There's nothing here to pick up.
[275:56.11]God, what shit RNG.
[276:22.46]There is no RNG in this game.
[276:28.26]Yeah, there is.
[276:30.58]It's all procedurally generated.
[276:32.80]The whole game, everything.
[276:36.05]Even, like, the dialogue that you see.
[276:59.79]Alright, don't do the same thing twice.
[277:01.11]The train screwed me over so bad.
[277:02.93]Get out of the road!
[277:04.49]Get out of the fucking road!
[277:06.45]Just stand in there, blocking the whole entrance.
[277:35.57]Alright Good taste
[278:07.28]I think I'm gonna go back to the little town.
[278:09.28]There we go.
[278:16.24]Alright, start actually picking up a bunch of shit.
[278:18.04]There we go.
[278:19.46]I'm getting most things up here now.
[278:53.57]Alright, where's next?
[278:55.77]Here?
[278:57.58]Okay, now we head over there.
[279:06.66]Give me the fence.
[279:08.84]Okay.
[279:23.71]Okay, now where?
[279:25.41]Over here?
[279:30.38]Spin it!
[279:33.18]What the fuck are you doing?
[279:52.47]There we go.
[279:53.21]I got here at like seven minutes left.
[279:57.02]I definitely have a much better pace.
[280:02.62]Woohoo!
[280:19.99]Me the houses.
[280:46.52]Next area is all the way over there to the right.
[280:50.28]No.
[280:57.61]12 minutes.
[281:05.15]Get as many trees as you can.
[281:13.66]Or none.
[281:15.10]None works too.
[281:30.04]all of them I'll come back
[282:01.61]Oh.
[282:02.21]This is a way better pace.
[282:13.40]Oh.
[282:33.07]10 minutes!
[283:02.04]oh not big enough yet but I can get it
[283:26.79]Are you going to play the Persona remake on stream?
[283:30.43]I never really got into Persona.
[283:32.51]Almost at 60, but I need...
[283:50.06]Alright.
[283:51.24]This is the end here.
[283:53.12]Alright.
[283:59.18]Over to New York.
[284:01.72]Soon.
[284:02.28]Ooh.
[284:21.67]Okay, I gotta... I don't know where to go.
[284:25.15]I wish I could pitch the camera differently.
[284:28.37]Instead of having to press the drive bumper, standing still.
[284:35.62]There we go.
[284:36.36]Can I get Mount Rushmore?
[284:37.90]Yep.
[284:51.02]Hollywood sign.
[284:54.73]I'm gonna go right over to New York.
[285:06.62]Alright, get it.
[285:19.40]Eight minutes.
[285:30.61]Plenty of time.
[285:51.49]All the, how big these?
[285:53.73]These things aren't that big, actually.
[285:55.35]I'm not big enough to pick these up?
[286:07.05]Yes, I am.
[286:07.57]Alright, out here.
[286:14.88]It's time to scale.
[286:33.78]Alright, back over here.
[286:44.79]Alright, give me the whole wall.
[286:48.77]There it is.
[286:49.19]Let's go.
[286:49.75]In the mountain.
[286:52.39]Present in the mountain.
[286:56.27]I need some more movement.
[287:01.15]I'm so slow.
[287:08.41]Got the islands.
[287:09.03]250.
[287:12.85]I need to get to 500.
[287:18.72]Not there yet.
[287:28.87]It looks like I have enough time, but I don't think it's still going to be close.
[287:55.61]Give me the monsters.
[287:59.37]You can definitely get up there, dude.
[288:00.73]What are you doing?
[288:02.01]Why could I not climb that?
[288:14.24]There's only islands left!
[288:15.24]Pick them up!
[288:19.05]Spin!
[288:19.99]Can I not spin anymore?
[288:34.64]Almost there.
[288:43.56]Oh, I see a cousin.
[288:46.17]Oh, it was LaLaLa.
[289:13.45]The band is still playing.
[289:14.55]They're waiting for me to start singing.
[289:15.93]And I just won't.
[289:18.49]I'm just dancing around the stage.
[289:19.97]The song has just... We've been playing the intro for the song for like 15 minutes.
[289:38.09]Alright, start picking up fucking islands.
[289:39.81]There we go.
[289:42.78]Get it all.
[289:44.38]All of it.
[289:45.64]Leave nothing left.
[289:46.42]Yeah, there it is.
[289:59.49]There's a whole sky world.
[290:07.50]Oh, I'm not big enough to get it.
[290:23.47]I'll be happy with a thousand.
[290:31.98]I am completely stuck.
[290:35.23]Come on.
[290:38.67]Alright, all these?
[290:41.47]These are huge.
[290:50.20]Dammit.
[290:50.90]What is that?
[290:51.62]I only got three minutes?
[290:57.02]Three minutes remaining is it?
[291:00.98]Oh!
[291:04.21]Oh!
[291:12.19]Oh, it's the- it's the king!
[291:19.48]Alright, we're going for Sky Island.
[291:28.81]You thought you were safe all the way up in the sky?
[291:31.51]Once you get this big, it is really hard to move it around.
[291:49.87]Am I actually not big enough to pick these up?
[291:53.83]Really?
[292:19.33]Can I get the volcano at least?
[292:22.93]No.
[292:23.59]I got some of it.
[292:24.87]What's going on?
[292:25.89]Oh, I'm ascending.
[292:50.71]Cool.
[292:51.05]1500, let's go.
[292:53.87]That's good enough.
[293:09.70]We don't fret about the future, the king is the king, you see.
[293:13.15]Oh, we feel so much better.
[293:14.09]Hmm, Katamari?
[293:16.09]Oh, we'd forgotten.
[293:18.61]Smaller than we thought.
[293:22.75]Oh!
[293:24.55]That thing is huge!
[293:25.35]I was sucking up whole volcanoes!
[293:31.49]We got a Mount Fuji as a present.
[293:33.19]Fabulous.
[293:34.41]It's kind of cool, but it's far too small.
[293:36.28]I got a new cousin, didn't I?
[293:54.98]Sweet, Big Bang, you've made the beginning.
[293:58.86]Mysterious Big Bang.
[294:40.02]I want to put on this new thing I got.
[295:08.14]64%.
[295:08.18]Save it.
[295:10.58]And I am going to call it here.
[295:11.74]I told you I had a little bit of a headache.
[295:16.65]It's starting to creep up a little more.
[295:19.21]It's the last level or two.
[295:23.69]I'm glad I streamed for five hours.
[295:25.15]Did I say like four?
[295:28.97]I will see you.
[295:30.07]We're going to finish this.
[295:33.30]What did I say I wanted to do?
[295:34.86]No, wait, wait, wait.
[295:35.70]Here's the plan.
[295:37.82]So, the plan is, on Monday, we're going to do Zumbinis.
[295:46.20]I'll probably finish this.
[295:47.58]We're going to finish this.
[295:48.56]Zumbinis.
[295:50.38]Sounds good.
[295:59.92]I want to get the other Zumbini games, but the only one they put on Steam was Logical Journey, which is, I think, the best one, but...
[296:09.72]I've never even played the other Zumbi and Easy games.
[296:15.93]Write that down so you don't forget it.
[296:17.01]I'll just type in something real quick.
[296:36.59]Okay.
[296:37.71]Who is he typing to?
[296:44.36]I'm going... Okay.
[296:53.06]When's the BLT stream?
[296:54.18]BLT stream is gonna be... That scares me every time.
[296:59.49]I'll leave the BLT... On... The same time I play Sorcery.
[297:11.64]When I play sorcery, I will eat a BLT before the stream starts.
[297:18.92]Will it be toasted?
[297:19.60]No, not a toast.
[297:20.54]I actually prefer BLT to be dry as fuck.
[297:28.53]What is this?
[297:30.57]Oh, it shows you all the stuff.
[297:36.05]No, of course it's gonna be bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo.
[297:42.03]On a sub roll.
[297:43.69]Not a sandwich bread.
[297:44.59]Sub roll.
[297:46.86]Get it right.
[297:47.82]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[297:52.08]Thanks for watching.
[297:52.62]We'll see you guys in a couple days.
[297:53.68]See you on Monday.
[297:58.57]Definitely.
[298:00.35]Definitely.
[298:02.89]See you Monday.
[298:05.69]Monday is very important.
[298:08.67]Uh... Monday's a really interesting big day.
[298:14.67]Very excited for Monday.
[298:17.95]Monday is gonna be an interesting day.
[298:20.31]I'm looking forward to it.
[298:22.27]We're gonna play Zoombinis.
[298:23.55]We're gonna play... I just said Five Nights at Freddy's.
[298:28.46]We're gonna play Zoombinis.
[298:29.62]We're gonna play Katamari.
[298:30.94]We're gonna do some other shit.
[298:32.78]I'm excited for Monday.
[298:35.76]Alright, Peggle.
[298:36.84]We're going to play Peggle.
[298:37.62]Good night, guys.
[298:44.93]Thanks for sticking around.
[298:47.61]Katamari is really fun.
[298:48.61]It's a great game.
[298:49.11]You should definitely get it.
[298:52.73]I'll finish it on stream.
[298:53.91]There's only like probably five or six more missions left, so.
[299:01.99]Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday.
[299:16.82]You gonna play Street Fighter again?
[299:20.52]I'm gonna practice Street Fighter off stream before I play it on stream again.
[299:24.42]And understand how combos work.
[299:27.66]But I haven't completely written it off yet.
[299:33.58]Somebody said so no.
[299:34.92]I don't know.
[299:35.82]It depends.
[299:41.72]Take care of yourselves.
[299:44.13]See you Monday.
[299:47.56]Very excited for Monday.
[299:51.89]Yeah.
[299:59.17]Hope your head heals.
[300:00.73]It's fine.
[300:01.26]It's just... One of those annoyances.
[300:08.72]I actually have not really...
[300:11.37]Besides maybe a few days ago?
[300:12.86]I'm trying to remember.
[300:14.26]I feel like it's been... I haven't had that many headaches lately.
[300:17.36]I've been on a pretty normal sleep schedule, though.
[300:21.76]I've actually been waking up in the morning, going to bed at night, that kind of thing.
[300:25.88]So I'm trying to get it back to normal.
[300:32.50]Yeah.
[300:36.96]Thanks a lot.
[300:39.18]Take care.
[300:40.79]See you Monday.
[300:44.28]How's Otto?
[300:44.74]Otto's doing good.
[300:48.12]Otto is doing good.
[300:52.87]Are you going to give a hard day for sorcery?
[300:54.87]I'll give it to you right now.
[300:57.57]We're going to go back to sorcery.
[300:58.55]We'll do a little recap.
[300:59.81]And we'll chill out.
[301:01.15]Drink some tea.
[301:07.38]On...
[301:18.99]24th.
[301:20.11]Saturday the 24th.
[301:21.43]Mark it on your calendars.
[301:22.31]That is Sorcery Day.
[301:27.88]We'll just relax a little bit.
[301:31.78]June 24th.
[301:33.04]Sounds like a good time.
[301:34.52]Two weeks from now?
[301:35.33]Two weekends?
[301:45.75]As always...
[301:50.79]Take care of yourselves.
[301:52.21]Goodbye.
[301:52.79]Call your mother.
[301:53.23]I'll see you Monday.
[302:08.72]Have a great night.
[302:15.38]See you soon.
[302:28.17]you
