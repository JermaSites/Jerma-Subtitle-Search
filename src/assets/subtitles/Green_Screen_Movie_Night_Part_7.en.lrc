[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.03]Hello.
[00:08.21]Good afternoon.
[00:08.77]Good evening.
[00:09.83]Probably good evening for most of you at this point.
[00:15.16]How are you?
[00:16.04]He's not even here.
[00:16.60]I'm here.
[00:21.91]Just because I don't talk for the first... I'm checking buttons and making sure things look okay.
[00:27.93]And checking knobs and twisties and... There's a lot of buttons here.
[00:34.91]There are a lot of buttons.
[00:37.43]You know, I can count them.
[00:39.52]You want me to count how many buttons I have to pay attention to?
[00:42.64]Let's do it.
[00:43.00]Okay, so here we go.
[00:43.84]1, 2... 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11...
[00:52.14]12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[00:56.19]I've got 20 buttons that I need to be aware of at all times.
[01:01.89]And let alone the keyboard.
[01:03.73]How many buttons are on a keyboard?
[01:07.48]A lot.
[01:09.62]There's probably 75 buttons that I need to be aware of at any given second.
[01:17.77]No, how are you?
[01:18.39]Good to see you.
[01:20.03]We're going to talk about a few things.
[01:21.91]I want, we're going to wait because obviously this is green screen movie night DLC.
[01:26.25]The second part of our green screen fun times, I guess you could say.
[01:37.35]This time we are going to be browsing through 125 videos, I think to be exact.
[01:46.99]will bring the total of videos shown so far after today at somewhere around 250 300 out of like 700 plus submissions so I'm just happy we might be able to get through half of them and then half of them got to get shown
[02:03.43]Again, I want to make this really clear.
[02:06.09]There were so many submissions and there were so many good ones that if your submission did not get shown, I'm sorry.
[02:14.18]I'm sorry that's just the way it works.
[02:16.04]There's no other way I can say it.
[02:19.84]When there's that many submissions, we have to be selective.
[02:22.64]So I'm really sorry if you don't get shown.
[02:25.13]It's not because yours wasn't good enough.
[02:28.69]It's because there were too many really good ones.
[02:32.37]No, I didn't say sorry, not good enough.
[02:39.90]Sorry.
[02:40.78]No, that's not what I said.
[02:43.22]He hates us.
[02:46.52]Yours sucked.
[02:48.44]And then a quote.
[02:49.34]That's not what I said.
[02:51.62]but oh god freddy dread I just looked over I I don't say anything I don't like shout out subs anymore you know that but freddy dread holy shit freddy dreads very talented talented young man follow freddy if you don't make some pretty sick music I've actually hung out with freddy in real life a lot of you maybe don't know that
[03:22.39]Maybe, Melvin, now you do.
[03:23.17]Alright, so, I plan- here's the thing.
[03:26.49]I planned on- I planned on doing a free baseball stream hype session, but that's probably not gonna happen.
[03:37.97]So what we're gonna do instead is we're gonna do a baseball hype session right now.
[03:47.39]And the reason why I thought about this is because there's not a whole lot that I'm going to talk about, right?
[03:54.48]I was trying to think if I was going to do like a one to two hour kind of a like ask me anything kind of thing with like we did with Dollhouse, I wouldn't be able to answer very many questions.
[04:05.83]Because I don't want to just be like, oh, this is this thing that's going to happen.
[04:08.90]This is this funny joke that I want to do.
[04:10.58]This is this how it's... No, I mean, the whole thing is essentially a... It's not like Dollhouse.
[04:16.46]It's a viewing experience, not necessarily a participating experience.
[04:21.33]But I do want to make sure that I put enough attention on it because as Ludwig famously told me, dude, you didn't even tweet when we did the replacement show.
[04:35.93]So let's hype it up.
[04:39.48]Let's go.
[04:45.24]There will be a tweet.
[04:46.56]I promise there will be a tweet in the next 24 to 48 hours to really hype up that show.
[04:54.33]But also, the difference between this and, let's say, the replacement show, I didn't want people to know I was doing the replacement show, right?
[05:01.48]Because I wanted that to be a big surprise that we were doing that, and I think it was pretty successful.
[05:07.18]Oh, I want you to know we're doing this, because this is obviously a much larger scale, and costs a lot more money, and has a lot more moving parts than the replacement show.
[05:20.80]But, I don't know.
[05:22.30]There were a lot of moving parts in the replacement show, too.
[05:24.37]There were a lot of people.
[05:28.35]Is there going to be merch?
[05:29.67]Yes.
[05:30.61]There will be.
[05:31.43]Okay, I will answer that.
[05:32.49]There will be merch for the baseball show.
[05:35.82]There will be specific themed merch for the baseball show.
[05:42.08]Yes, there will.
[05:44.09]And I will tell you this.
[05:48.31]the let's just go over what the show is okay it is part of the Jerma baseball association a lot of you guys didn't know that I had I had a league uh I am the sole umpire of the whole game and and this exhibition match it's between the California circus and the Maryland magicians
[06:16.78]I am the only umpire of the entire game.
[06:21.16]That's my role.
[06:22.25]I'm going to take it very seriously.
[06:23.55]I'm going to take it incredibly seriously.
[06:25.35]You dropped some frames, I did?
[06:30.09]Oh, shit, I did.
[06:31.69]Let's hope that's not a problem.
[06:43.67]Somebody said, you're going to get hit, aren't you?
[06:50.29]You don't know.
[06:51.81]Listen to me.
[06:53.00]I think a lot of people don't understand what this show is.
[06:56.04]This is, listen to me.
[06:58.06]This is a real baseball game between real baseball players.
[07:03.72]This is a real baseball game that I am going to be officiating.
[07:09.85]This is not, oh, it's a fake game.
[07:13.29]No, this is real shit.
[07:15.39]Real baseball.
[07:19.20]Real umpiring.
[07:21.70]And yes, I have practiced.
[07:25.20]You don't think that I have spent at least the last few weeks studying umpire terminology?
[07:32.94]Studying umpire stances?
[07:34.98]Studying how to call a game?
[07:36.50]You don't think that I've done that?
[07:37.92]What, you're not going to give me the credit?
[07:39.38]You don't think I've done that?
[07:43.85]I'm going to call a very, very good game.
[07:48.57]Can we get your best year out of here?
[07:54.43]Will there be hot dogs?
[07:55.33]Of course there will.
[07:58.79]Wait, did somebody just say, what the fuck is an umpire?
[08:03.00]You don't know what an umpire is?
[08:05.78]What the fuck?
[08:07.10]Oh, what do you think, it's like a judge?
[08:08.50]I mean, it kind of is a judge.
[08:13.82]Dude, what is an umpire?
[08:16.33]Okay, we have a problem if a lot of you don't even know what an umpire is.
[08:21.61]An umpire is the referee of the game, essentially.
[08:33.09]What time is it at?
[08:34.99]4.30 Pacific PM.
[08:40.03]At 7.30 Eastern Time.
[08:43.73]We need to stream of you explaining what baseball is.
[08:48.20]Somebody made a shirt for the show.
[08:50.24]That's awesome.
[08:51.04]Let me see.
[08:52.58]Hold on, I'll show this.
[09:01.45]Well, that was probably really loud.
[09:02.39]Maybe not.
[09:03.43]It wasn't too loud.
[09:08.93]Okay, but yeah.
[09:11.53]Let's see.
[09:14.37]Where did this go?
[09:14.89]Oh, there it is.
[09:18.39]But yes, this is not official merch or anything, but this is cool.
[09:23.16]Somebody made this?
[09:29.50]Let me make it smaller.
[09:32.03]Look at that.
[09:33.73]You're going to wear this during the show.
[09:35.63]Well, yeah, good.
[09:40.49]Is it going to be popcorn?
[09:41.41]Probably.
[09:43.67]Soothe them.
[09:47.95]That's the first comment that I read.
[09:49.53]This is really cool.
[09:54.55]That's awesome.
[09:57.03]Yeah, wear it.
[09:59.95]Yeah, we've got broadcasters.
[10:04.89]There will be people calling this game.
[10:07.41]There are two broadcasters.
[10:09.81]They are professional baseball commentators.
[10:14.30]That's very important for you to understand too.
[10:20.50]It's a game of baseball.
[10:25.04]And I know a lot of people have asked this question, so I'm going to answer it.
[10:30.40]There are no special guest appearances on this stream.
[10:35.37]There aren't.
[10:36.87]This is a game of baseball.
[10:38.97]There's no other streamers on this.
[10:40.31]It's just me, the circus, magicians.
[10:47.41]There's nobody else.
[10:51.20]Not a lot of people were asking, wait, is this person going to be there?
[10:54.13]What about that person?
[10:54.87]Oh, I wonder if this person... Let me just make sure you understand.
[10:57.77]It's just me calling a good, clean game of baseball.
[11:06.56]Are you lying?
[11:06.92]No, I'm not lying.
[11:10.06]You're a liar.
[11:10.54]No.
[11:17.52]Just wait for the next one after baseball if you want to see some potential special guests, okay?
[11:24.53]Just wait for the next one after baseball.
[11:29.10]Because that'll be something that's talked about very soon after baseball.
[11:35.68]Are you playing in the game?
[11:37.18]I am the umpire.
[11:39.60]I got to call every ball, every strike.
[11:42.06]I'm going to be behind the plate.
[11:43.06]I'm going to be out there in the field, making sure I call it correct.
[11:54.15]Do you pinky swear?
[11:55.03]Well, there's nothing for me to... I don't want to give much away.
[11:57.43]Can we bet on the game?
[12:00.92]I'm sure the mods will probably do it at the beginning.
[12:09.35]How long is the game going to go for?
[12:12.03]Well, that all depends on how long it takes to play nine innings of baseball.
[12:16.03]Sometimes it depends.
[12:16.69]It depends if it's a big scoring inning, big scoring half inning.
[12:21.60]You're talking about probably three to five hours, depending.
[12:30.88]Something along those lines.
[12:34.00]The date is the 19th, August 19th, which if you look at your calendar, that's this Friday coming up here.
[12:40.44]Friday.
[12:44.02]Is the umpire the masked guy?
[12:45.99]Yes.
[12:48.01]Yes, the umpire is the masked guy behind the plate.
[12:53.43]The one with the mask.
[12:54.89]Yes, there you go.
[12:56.17]Hope maybe you guys can get it there.
[13:06.89]Will you please do a cricket stream for EU?
[13:08.95]I don't know cricket, so no.
[13:12.92]I'm answering as many questions as I can.
[13:22.42]Is Jigsaw going to be there?
[13:23.83]No.
[13:24.65]Why would Jigsaw be here?
[13:28.65]What purpose would Jigsaw have at the baseball game?
[13:41.12]Are you dropping frames?
[13:42.20]I am not drop.
[13:43.89]I dropped a couple frames in the very beginning, but I have not dropped any frames.
[13:48.93]In the last 10 straight minutes.
[13:51.77]I don't know if I don't see anything on my end.
[13:54.83]Right when I turn the stream on, I drop some, but there are no drop frames now.
[13:58.09]I wonder if it's a Twitch problem.
[14:01.03]Maybe try refresh.
[14:03.87]It keeps loading for me.
[14:04.99]That's weird.
[14:07.67]Is it is it actually happening?
[14:11.43]Because I don't see anything on my end here.
[14:17.91]What if it rains?
[14:19.65]Oh, then I'm fucked.
[14:22.83]Here's the thing about rain.
[14:25.39]You can play baseball in the rain.
[14:29.56]Just drop some more or buffer.
[14:31.44]Really?
[14:33.72]You can play baseball in the rain.
[14:36.02]As long as it's not too crazy.
[14:42.14]Is everybody having issues with the stream dropping?
[14:47.76]Because I don't see any on my end.
[14:51.52]Is this happening to everybody?
[14:54.38]What?
[14:56.54]I don't see any problems at all here.
[14:59.17]What's happening?
[15:01.11]I don't know.
[15:03.29]It buffers for a second.
[15:04.61]It does?
[15:10.25]Huh.
[15:15.91]Yeah, I think this is a Twitch issue.
[15:19.23]Because I mean, usually I can see it and it's usually me.
[15:23.37]Hold on, let me check something.
[15:27.76]Usually I can look over here and see like my stream health and see the amount of frames I've dropped and I haven't really dropped any.
[15:34.08]That's kind of concerning considering this is the green screen DLC movie night.
[15:43.46]Let's see here.
[15:51.77]Huh.
[15:52.33]Well, let's ride it out for a second.
[15:59.12]Let me know if it happens again.
[16:02.18]People are collectively saying it's buffering at the same time, so it seems to be a Twitch thing.
[16:05.59]Huh.
[16:08.37]Well, let's hope it passes.
[16:09.19]My DLC is lagging.
[16:13.69]Uh-oh.
[16:25.16]Please walk, everybody.
[16:29.51]Alright, well, here's the thing.
[16:33.83]All these calls, everything is at my discretion.
[16:37.84]No one else.
[16:39.92]When I started talking to Community Jake about this idea a long time ago, because, you know, usually I write up a bunch of shit.
[16:47.62]I call up Jake.
[16:49.12]I'm like, Jake, there's a thing I want to do.
[16:50.76]He's like, okay.
[16:51.40]And we start going back and forth.
[16:52.99]Jake starts to figure out what things that we can do, where we can do it.
[16:56.49]We're hiring the right people, whatever, right?
[16:58.95]So I write a bunch of shit up and I give it to Jake.
[17:03.21]And Jake came back to me when I first came up with this idea.
[17:05.15]And he said, hey, you have to call a whole game of baseball with this idea.
[17:09.84]like what what if you don't know like a certain rule I'm just like who cares he's like but what if you don't know what to do like well I'll just figure it out whatever I'll just I'll make something up like I'm I I could get a lot of calls wrong but I don't think I will I think it's gonna be fine
[17:40.71]He's like, okay, like, yeah, like I'm looking at all the things you've written here.
[17:44.34]And the most concerning thing is the fact that you need to call a full real game of baseball.
[17:48.76]And I'm like, yeah, okay.
[17:50.58]Alright.
[17:57.44]Should we try?
[17:57.90]Should we go for it?
[18:02.13]You need to wrap it up.
[18:03.31]Well, I can't, I don't want to wrap it up if people are dropping the frames every 10 seconds.
[18:07.93]It's not my internet.
[18:09.85]Is it happening in a while?
[18:10.79]Are we okay?
[18:11.29]Should I just go?
[18:12.25]Yeah, we typically would have gone by now.
[18:22.84]I just, it's not dropping anything right now.
[18:25.22]Okay.
[18:25.54]Alright.
[18:25.78]Whatever.
[18:26.08]Let's go.

[23:58.56]There's got to be a different term.

[25:18.84]I feel actually alright.
[25:20.22]I feel warm.
[25:20.86]I feel really warm now.
[25:21.98]What the hell?
[25:22.98]What was that?
[25:23.52]What was that?
[25:42.01]I got an 830 res at Dorsia.
[25:44.50]Great.
[25:45.74]Sea urchin ceviche.
[25:48.20]Dorsia on Friday night.
[25:49.48]How do you swing that?
[25:50.84]I think he's lying.
[25:51.78]Is this your regular deck of cards?
[25:55.18]Is that a gram?
[25:56.76]There you go.
[25:57.30]There you go.
[25:58.98]Playing cards.
[26:00.01]Pick a card.
[26:00.47]Any card.
[26:00.85]I don't want to see.
[26:02.13]Pick a card.
[26:03.37]Pick a card.
[26:03.81]Very nice.
[26:05.39]Look at that.

[26:06.59]That one right there?
[26:08.46]Good color.
[26:08.84]Take that one.
[26:09.28]I'm going to stick it back in the deck right here.
[26:11.76]Check that out.
[26:12.73]Cut it.
[26:13.53]It's very cool, Bateman, but that's nothing.
[26:16.03]Look at this.
[26:17.53]That is really nice.
[26:19.47]Eggshell with Romalion type.
[26:22.53]What do you think?
[26:23.77]What was it again?
[26:24.29]What was that card?
[26:26.01]That one right there, wasn't it?
[26:28.02]Bingo.
[26:29.24]Jesus.
[26:30.50]That is really super.
[26:31.64]How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?
[26:33.34]I have no idea.
[26:36.90]Not a clue.
[26:38.66]Not a clue.
[26:40.12]But wait, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[26:45.36]Raised lettering, pale nimbus.
[26:47.58]Is that the card right there?
[26:52.07]Oh, it's a joker.
[26:57.35]Bingo.
[26:57.71]Here's your card.
[27:01.05]Thank you.
[27:02.98]You're right.
[27:03.74]Absolutely.
[27:04.86]Let's do this now.
[27:05.64]Ready?
[27:05.94]Check this out.
[27:20.01]I'm going to strangle your parents, okay?
[27:26.59]I'm really sorry that people are having problems.
[27:29.18]I think Twitch is fucked.
[27:30.92]That was a really good one.
[27:32.12]That was a very good one.
[27:33.36]I hope some of you got to see it.
[27:40.12]I wonder, should I switch servers or something?
[27:44.48]The audio is really quiet too.
[27:46.19]It shouldn't be.
[27:51.78]Alright, actually, answer this poll truthfully.
[27:55.24]We're not joking around.
[27:56.28]Truth only.
[27:57.54]Truth only.
[27:59.28]Can I get a poll?
[28:01.10]Are you having a bunch of stream problems?
[28:03.50]Like, lagging.
[28:07.07]Because I'm looking over and I'm seeing a ton of people say they have problems.
[28:11.15]And answer the poll honestly.
[28:14.39]Are you having problems watching this stream?
[28:16.99]Yes or no?
[28:22.69]Answer truthfully.
[28:30.35]I want it to be answered completely and totally truthfully.
[28:38.31]It's happening on multiple streams.
[28:41.33]Shit.
[28:47.86]Did we just deal with it?
[28:50.27]Did we just put... I mean, this is 20% of all of you apparently are having a problem.
[28:55.27]That's a lot of people.
[28:56.56]Is it alright?
[28:57.20]Should we just deal with it?
[29:06.62]Sometimes it's regional.
[29:08.18]I wonder if this Twitch server problem going to some of you guys.
[29:15.83]Because I would tell you, because you know me, man, if I have internet problems, I will not stop talking about it.
[29:22.13]If I drop frames, you know for a fact I'm going to be like, I don't understand.
[29:25.99]I don't get it.
[29:26.59]Why am I dropping frames?
[29:27.27]I don't understand.
[29:28.63]So, I mean, that's not happening at all.
[29:30.23]So I hope we're just going to power through it, I guess.
[29:36.70]So 20% of you, I'm really sorry.
[29:41.38]But it sucks that it's on this stream.
[29:45.65]Hopefully I figured that out, because that's not cool.
[29:49.97]Alright, let's go.
[29:51.15]I'm sorry.
[29:51.73]I know a lot of you guys are going to be probably spamming FS or F for stream, but we're going to power through it.
[29:58.91]It's not on my end.
[29:59.82]I'm really sorry, but we're going.
[30:03.08]Dermot the Grillmaster.
[30:05.10]I'm going to strangle your parents, okay?
[30:06.94]That's what's going to happen to them.
[30:08.24]I'm going to put my hands around their neck and strangle them.
[30:11.61]Smoke meats for real old-fashioned barbecue.
[30:14.39]Absolutely anywhere you go.
[30:16.17]With the revolutionary Red Devil.
[30:17.94]The portable outdoor kitchen from Quantum Homeware.

[30:25.22]Be careful over there.
[30:26.30]Be careful.
[30:26.84]Don't be too rough.
[30:28.19]Ah.

[30:49.66]I don't know, nobody can hear me, but still.
[30:51.12]Just sit up here all fucking goddamn day.
[30:52.74]With 15 patties here.
[31:09.92]Four of them are gonna get eaten.
[31:10.80]Stupid fucking idiots.
[31:12.12]Does anybody want dogs?
[31:12.98]No one wants a dog.
[31:37.08]So what's your favorite thing about this shape?
[31:38.88]Well, it even cooks pizza, too.
[31:42.42]I love pizza.
[31:46.44]Yep, you're my boy.
[31:47.78]Yeah, you are.
[31:48.26]Oh, goodness.

[31:53.12]Phil, we've got something you're gonna love under this one.
[31:55.84]Now, you don't believe in barbecue sauce, right?
[31:58.32]Right?
[31:58.84]You believe that... Say how many fucking hot dogs I'm gonna make.
[32:01.77]It's seven?
[32:02.45]And nobody eats them!
[32:03.67]Nobody eats seven dogs!
[32:07.93]You know, I'm going to eat one.
[32:11.84]Those are fucking gross.
[32:12.68]Those are raw.

[39:24.14]It's about grilling out here with the family, with the friends, and yeah, alright, okay.
[39:31.37]You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.
[39:34.47]You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows.

[39:49.07]No, I think I deserve to win.
[39:58.16]I need to break that one down for a second.
[40:02.00]My favorite part about the last one was how the guy with the grill is saying, why don't I hire someone to be here and do this?
[40:13.12]But what do you mean hire someone?
[40:14.38]Like, you're the chef.
[40:15.54]Like, why?
[40:18.90]Okay, what is this?
[40:19.80]Use your eyes.
[40:20.40]E-clown poses as driving instructor?
[40:23.03]It's going to get you two grades off, I think.
[40:25.51]You're not getting your license today, by the way.
[40:31.53]No human drives a car like this.
[40:33.37]You could get a chimpanzee in this car.
[40:34.79]You'd probably do better with the test than you did.
[40:36.63]You'd get an armadillo.
[40:37.44]You could do this test.
[40:38.40]You'd get an ant.
[40:39.62]Alright, could you pull this way and park for me, please?
[40:41.76]Right there, right there.
[40:42.36]Oh.
[40:43.59]Pull in smoothly.
[40:44.57]Smooth it out.
[40:46.57]Stop.
[40:46.89]Throw your window down.
[40:49.73]You give me an army of ants and get them up to the wheel.
[40:52.91]Four or five thousand ants.
[40:53.93]What is going on?
[40:54.61]And I could train them to do a better parallel parking job than you could ever imagine.
[40:59.62]What is going on?
[41:00.56]Get out of the way.
[41:01.50]I'd like to try a new chicken tendie combo.

[41:07.04]Two cheeseburgers.
[41:09.11]Three McChickens.
[41:10.39]You don't think I can do that?
[41:11.11]You don't think I can train ants to do that?
[41:13.36]What's that?
[41:13.66]You don't think I'm smart enough to train ants?
[41:15.28]Can I have no sauce on the McChickens?
[41:18.12]No sauce, please?
[41:19.32]Uh, what are you talking about?
[41:21.09]You can't do that here.

[51:53.94]Patient J and E mental asylum was reported missing from facility.
[51:57.24]Patient J985 was diagnosed with severe paranoid schizophrenia and was often seen, hearing things that others should perceive.
[52:03.10]He's being held in solitary confinement due to his aggression towards other patients and staff.
[52:05.75]He's a member of the security.
[52:06.63]Okay.
[52:09.89]Wildlife trail cam?
[52:21.27]Was that the splatoons?
[52:56.62]I just feel like there's bugs everywhere.
[53:00.06]I hate coming out here if there's bugs everywhere.
[53:01.44]I don't like when the bugs are everywhere.
[53:03.34]I can tolerate them when they're in small doses.

[55:07.59]What you see before you is a choice.
[55:19.66]A very important choice.
[55:23.00]One that will live with you forever.
[55:25.98]If you can make it, you might be able to save yourself.
[55:28.78]There's a key inside of your eyeball.
[55:31.26]Dig it up with your bare hands and eat it.
[55:33.44]Then just shit it out.
[55:34.26]Shit it out then.
[55:35.22]Only then do you need the keys.
[55:37.44]Why would I have a tricycle this small?
[55:40.32]Why wouldn't I get one for adults?
[55:42.58]Get one for adults.

[59:04.77]Unbelievable.
[59:09.95]What a real piece of work you are.
[59:11.47]What?
[59:12.97]I've got something to say to you, and hopefully you listen this time.
[59:17.44]You know what?
[59:19.06]I can't even say it to you, but you know what I was going to say.
[59:22.97]I was going to say, forget you.
[59:25.63]That's better.
[59:26.40]Forget you.
[59:28.72]You are a real piece of work.
[59:38.38]Hopefully you can hear me.
[59:42.86]So what?

[59:54.40]Ow!
[59:58.12]This one's awesome.

[60:04.84]Please!
[60:06.38]You hit way too hard!
[60:10.06]Ow, my butthole.
[60:30.94]I feel like I'm at like a weird audition.
[60:33.40]I feel like I'm at an audition right now.
[60:35.30]There's like three people with clipboards over there and they're just like judging every word I'm saying.
[60:40.82]How we doing?
[60:41.30]How are we?
[60:41.78]Good?
[60:43.76]You can begin at any point.
[60:45.30]Wait, what?
[60:47.10]I'm going to be paying a lot of attention to what you're doing, by the way.
[60:51.24]Yeah.
[60:55.40]I'm an actor, and I'm a good one.
[60:57.56]A good actor can take a script and can change it and make it sound better in front of the camera.
[61:03.08]I'm an actor.
[61:04.78]Are you an actor?
[61:06.28]Can you do this?
[61:09.12]Okay, I don't know what that was, but just stay in your lane here, please.
[61:13.42]Nope.
[61:15.18]I'm an actor.
[61:16.43]I act for a living.
[61:20.58]I can't just like sit up here and just like fucking do like a one-man monologue show.
[61:25.99]Okay, I'm gonna have to take off a few points for that one.
[61:28.51]It's gonna get you two grades off, I think.
[61:30.49]Like I'm just doing like an acting study.
[61:32.84]Like I'm not, who's gonna use it for anything?
[61:35.32]Alright, yeah, we're gonna play a new song.
[61:36.66]This one is something we've been working on for a long time.
[61:39.16]I hope you all enjoy it.
[61:40.24]It doesn't have a name, it's currently untitled, so.
[61:44.59]That's what we're going to do.
[61:45.27]It's an untitled song, and I hope you enjoy it.
[61:47.91]Maybe you can help us come up with a title after the end of the show.
[61:58.02]Alright, that's enough.
[61:59.00]That's enough.
[61:59.94]Very nice.
[62:01.69]Now, that was a good one.
[62:03.53]And now, we proudly present to you, the tale, the great King Jeremiah, son of Albert.
[62:22.38]I want everyone to understand that the king made a lot of good things happen today, don't you think?
[62:31.25]You little jester over there, you're so funny.
[62:39.09]It's like show 200 of my residency in Vegas.
[62:43.19]Feed him to the lions.
[62:46.17]Yeah, feed him.
[62:47.49]Feed him to the lions, don't you think?
[62:56.82]I don't know how to twerk.
[62:59.09]How do you twerk?
[63:02.11]Get the crown off.
[63:07.07]What's a crown?
[63:08.85]Whose crown could this be?
[63:11.13]Don't mind if I do.
[63:12.73]Don't mind if I do.
[63:17.18]The king's treasures are so heavy.
[63:18.96]There must be so many things in here.
[63:21.26]Let me take a look.
[63:22.36]Stop.
[63:22.56]Let me see.
[63:28.25]uh yeah that was that was seriously like oh guys I've got this show in Las Vegas I've got residency in this place whatever whatever city and that's after like 180 shows I'm just completely phoning it in and it's just like it's everyone's giving me terrible reviews on trip advisor Jerma show trailer oh no world he inhabits is in some respects counterfeit
[63:57.21]There's nothing fake about Jerma himself.
[64:00.80]No scripts, no cue cards.
[64:04.14]It isn't always Shakespeare, but it's genuine.
[64:08.25]It's a life.
[64:13.37]I'm not gonna make it.
[64:14.55]You're gonna have to.
[64:21.03]We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort and
[64:44.97]Well, for me, there is no difference between a private life and a public life.
[64:49.28]My life is my life, is The Truman Show.
[64:52.18]The Truman Show is a lifestyle.
[64:54.88]It's a noble life.
[64:56.40]It is a truly blessed life.
[65:02.02]Yeah, tell me something I don't know.
[65:05.88]Alright, promise me one thing, though.
[65:09.67]If I die before I reach the summit, you'll use me as an alternative superhero.
[65:21.75]It's all true.
[65:22.87]It's all real.
[65:24.13]Nothing here is fake.
[65:25.04]Nothing you see on this show is fake.
[65:28.00]It's merely controlled.
[65:30.92]Oh my god.
[65:31.96]Damn it.
[65:39.66]That's an order.
[65:43.72]Maybe just your love handles.
[65:46.61]I have love handles.
[65:53.82]Okay.
[66:05.93]Oh, my God.
[66:06.91]Howdy.
[66:09.61]Good morning.
[66:10.49]Morning.
[66:10.89]Good morning.

[66:22.43]Yeah.
[66:22.90]The whole.
[66:23.52]Alright.
[66:28.15]Yes, yes, okay.
[66:29.17]We had to, for those of you that weren't here last time, I need to make sure I say this.
[66:34.67]Somebody edited the entire Truman Show movie and put me in every single scene.
[66:40.14]It must've taken weeks to do.
[66:42.36]It must've taken so long.
[66:45.28]And we had to deny it.
[66:46.60]We can't show that.
[66:48.70]We can't show the entire movie.
[66:51.16]That's not gonna happen.
[66:52.92]Truman Show is a beloved movie that's still available to purchase.
[66:58.65]I cannot tell you to go do that.
[67:00.09]I cannot tell you to watch that.
[67:01.41]All I can tell you is that's insane.
[67:03.79]That's absolutely insane.
[67:06.37]Okay, how on Earth do you balance like that?
[67:10.01]They said it took over two months.
[67:12.39]Why?
[67:14.85]Why?
[67:19.23]That's ridiculous.
[67:22.62]I can't.
[67:27.48]Alright, let's keep going.
[67:28.40]This is how on Earth do you balance like that?
[67:36.21]How do you do that?
[67:37.07]How on Earth do you balance like that?
[68:15.94]I think we saw this one.
[68:21.56]What did we not?
[68:45.19]What the hell just happened?
[68:48.84]Jerma gets scammed in RuneScape.
[68:50.54]That was insane.
[68:51.32]Oh, wow.
[69:11.23]A magical potion?
[69:12.73]This is for me?
[69:14.29]No way.
[69:15.56]Thank you.
[69:17.34]How much do I owe you, stranger?
[69:18.56]10 pieces of gold?

[69:35.55]That hurts a little.
[69:39.35]Hey.
[69:41.28]It feels... My whole face hurts.
[69:43.88]My face is burning.
[69:46.06]That burns a lot.

[70:34.00]Here, walk down and get the hell out of here, dude.
[70:40.08]Alright, Jerma's on the move, and the UFO hasn't shown up yet.
[70:42.96]I don't know what's taking it so long.
[70:44.69]I called it like ten minutes ago.
[70:46.45]If only there was some sort of transition or something that could make this go by a lot quicker.
[70:50.13]Can we watch something else?
[70:52.45]It's about to get really good.
[70:53.45]It's about to get really good.

[71:34.95]Yes.
[71:35.95]Did you get any money?
[71:37.49]No.
[71:38.27]Alright, well all of our time has been wasted.
[71:39.93]I don't know how we're going to end it here.
[71:52.50]Unfortunately, I have to diagnose you with cringe.

[72:08.66]What?
[72:10.83]Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job.
[72:16.15]No one is more deserving of a rest, and all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until... Well, let's just say your hour has come again.
[72:30.61]Huh?
[72:32.39]The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world.
[72:39.96]So wake up, Mr. Freeman.
[72:43.98]Wake up and smell the ashes.
[72:49.31]End of the line.

[74:29.36]That's crazy.
[74:31.38]Dude, look, you can see.
[74:32.44]You can see the water rides.
[74:34.18]I didn't even know the park had water rides.
[74:41.53]Jesus army of pants and get them up to the wheel four or five thousand minutes And I could train them to do a better parallel parking job than you could ever imagine Do you see what what's in front of us you do right?

[75:12.02]What?
[75:12.22]What is going on?
[75:15.50]Is this the same video?
[75:17.44]No, it's a different video.
[75:18.88]What's going on?
[75:19.81]Oh, shit, I got...
[75:39.02]Dad.
[75:41.66]Dad.
[75:41.91]Dad!
[75:42.11]What's he doing out here?
[75:43.31]Aren't you guys friends?
[75:44.83]Oh my god.
[76:09.94]Shut the fuck up.
[76:14.54]This water is so dirty.
[76:25.98]I learned this one when I was traveling.
[76:27.36]Abroad, right?
[76:36.85]What?
[77:11.83]That's it?
[77:12.39]Wait, what?
[77:13.69]The portable outdoor kitchen from Quantum Homewares.
[77:16.79]It's so hot.
[77:17.57]What a terrible day to be cooking in the kitchen.
[77:19.53]Didn't even go in the kitchen.
[77:21.71]How did you make all this incredible looking food?
[77:24.37]That's why I invited everybody here today.
[77:26.99]I want to show you something that me and I have found that is so revolutionary.
[77:31.40]It has literally changed the way we think about cooking.
[77:35.06]When I take a tally... When I take a tally...
[77:40.00]And I say, what do you want?
[77:41.34]Do you want a burger or do you want a dog?
[77:43.24]And I hear, dog, dog, dog.
[77:45.16]I think a fucking dog.
[77:49.13]Phil, we've got something you're going to love under this one.
[77:51.91]Now, you don't believe in barbecue sauce, right?
[77:55.04]You believe that true barbecue should be smoked, right?
[77:57.94]Look at this.
[77:59.92]Just add moist wood chips underneath the grilling rack.
[78:02.64]I like mesquite.
[78:04.00]And you can cook meats like delicious smoked turkey, even real old-fashioned barbecue ribs.
[78:09.07]You know, Mick, the super skillet really is the perfect wok, but there's a much more important reason for this curved design.
[78:14.23]Ah, that's right.
[78:15.27]You see, what I'm using is the shape... Shut up!
[78:18.99]You like to talk like you know the food, but you actually really don't.
[78:21.88]You got kicked out of chef school.
[78:23.28]I didn't.
[78:23.88]Shut up.
[78:24.54]Just look at that.
[78:25.50]That's great.
[78:26.61]But watch this.

[88:10.23]And he looks fucking amazing.
[88:11.31]Oh my God.
[88:13.80]Let me check and see how you're doing.
[88:14.94]He was cut up, blemish-free, flowing hair, healthy.
[88:18.44]Very, very healthy sounding.
[88:20.25]Very healthy.
[88:21.69]Yeah.
[88:22.65]I haven't had a headache, by the way, in a long time.
[88:24.43]If I fly, it's not down, right?
[88:25.49]I'm not gonna get in trouble.
[88:26.77]You wanna eat some bugs?
[88:31.25]And we eat bugs together and have a romantic relationship of some kind?

[89:01.52]A lot of fucking weird shit.
[89:05.75]You did this.
[89:06.73]That can't be right.
[89:08.53]You did this, and you can fix it too.
[89:12.07]This can't be right.
[89:13.75]I'm killing you.
[89:15.41]I'm killing you.
[89:16.65]I don't care about anything else.
[89:17.79]I don't give a shit about anything else.
[89:19.28]Back up.
[89:19.72]Everybody back up.
[89:20.40]I'll prove it.
[89:21.24]What is this?
[89:21.96]I don't know what that is.
[89:22.74]My programming is just getting... What is this?
[89:25.74]Why does this exist?
[89:26.68]This fucking guy.
[89:27.76]Explain this to me right now.
[89:34.91]I feel like a completely different person.
[89:36.27]What's your name?

[89:38.95]I'm Sean.
[89:39.95]Shave Sean.
[89:41.21]From now on.
[89:47.20]Are you scared?
[89:50.46]Yeah, I bet you are.
[89:51.30]I bet you're scared.
[89:55.62]I'm not scared at all.
[90:01.18]You're listening to KO City Pirate Radio.
[90:05.16]I'm taking over the airwaves to welcome all you new brawlers out there.
[90:09.54]Lace up your shoes, tie back your hair, and kiss your mama goodbye.
[90:14.20]This is Knockout City.
[90:19.72]New in town and looking to make a name for yourself?
[90:22.70]Your humble DJ's here to talk you through those first brawl jitters.
[90:27.02]Team KO, round one.
[90:30.94]Let's start with the basics.
[90:32.62]Get a hit before they hit you.
[90:34.98]Ooh, that looked like it hurt.
[90:37.62]You gotta learn to catch if you wanna like that.
[90:41.08]This cat's gotta figure it out.
[90:43.14]On a quest to be the best.
[90:45.68]They're putting their skills to the test.
[90:48.58]And class is in session, baby.
[90:52.52]Oh man, that's just mean.
[90:54.78]Is this game fun?
[90:55.94]I admit, you cool.
[90:58.26]But some advice.
[90:59.84]That's it.
[91:00.66]Get yourself a crew.
[91:04.60]Going solo in this city will only get you so far.
[91:08.67]When brawlers unite, it's like poetry in motion.
[91:13.50]But hey, it's not all throws and KOs.
[91:16.96]Go the extra mile and define that style.
[91:21.32]And as your crew ups its ranking on the streets, there's an opportunity to claim some serious loot.
[91:31.03]Okay, back to the action.
[91:34.97]I'm telling you, this city has it all.
[91:37.92]This took a lot of time There's so many small edits
[92:06.95]Just remember, this ain't dodge ball.
[92:11.47]It's dodge brawl.
[92:12.85]You think I was going to catch it?
[92:18.70]Gotcha.
[92:22.46]Pass to me.
[92:31.52]Crew up and show me what you got.
[92:33.16]I'll be watching.
[92:40.27]Hey, they will knock out city.
[92:41.75]I guess you could play it today if you'd like to.
[92:44.95]Oh, no.
[92:46.57]Not what I want you to do.
[92:47.55]Another driving one.
[92:48.69]I want you to pull that McDonald's.
[92:49.89]What?
[92:50.55]McDonald's?
[92:52.00]Very important part of your test.
[92:53.02]Driving through a drive-thru is actually very hard.
[92:55.72]Why?
[92:56.48]It's a very narrow road.
[92:57.80]It's a very narrow part of... It's hard to kind of navigate in there.

[93:05.16]Right there.
[93:05.40]Right there.

[93:09.89]Stop.
[93:10.21]Throw your window down.
[93:15.29]Get out of the way.

[93:45.14]I'm marking that down on your exam.
[93:47.98]Why?
[93:48.50]What?
[93:49.64]You can't do a McDonald's without any fucking sauce.
[93:52.19]You can't take it off?
[93:53.49]No, that's okay.
[93:54.41]That's alright.

[94:50.22]Keep that in mind.

[96:38.08]Mr. Gerard, I don't want to buy Google stock.
[96:40.82]I don't want to buy the TikTok company.
[96:45.86]That was ridiculous.
[96:59.34]Oh my God.
[96:59.98]OK, so this one is called a daytime television show.
[97:05.28]Jigsaw Jigsaw is here.
[97:11.88]How did he get in here?
[97:20.15]How did he get in here?
[97:21.71]You're not supposed to be able to get in here.
[97:28.67]No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[97:30.79]You didn't make your choice.
[97:33.11]Your choice is to be killed.
[97:35.09]Oh, shit.
[97:36.45]Hi, everyone.
[97:40.46]My name's Sean Elberton.
[97:44.00]I'm the actor, writer, director, producer, and main talent of the daytime television show Jigsaw Is Here.
[98:00.28]And it's something very important that we all have to do.
[98:02.82]We have to make choices.
[98:04.69]And one choice is for you to watch this show, because the ratings have been very poor.
[98:09.43]And I believe that we are below reruns of infomercials at this point.
[98:15.72]So I figured we could give you a quick little, like, maybe you could watch the show if you want.
[98:20.22]I think you're going to love it even more now, because look what we can do.
[98:23.72]Big, thick, man-sized sandwiches.
[98:34.11]I almost just took down the whole camera!
[99:01.45]Come on, let's go!
[99:02.33]Let's do the Mario!
[99:03.63]No, no, no!

[100:43.20]Thanks.
[100:43.84]Onyx here.
[100:44.44]It's complete pandemonium out on the street tonight at Park Avenue.
[100:47.88]Tossies or compact streamers are causing complete and total chaos.
[100:55.17]Police reports state that the outbreak was caused when a car accident awoke a mythical streamer, Sherman985, who sent his army of clones to wreak havoc on our mortal plane.
[101:03.93]All citizens are advised to arm themselves and stay indoors until the crisis is resolved.
[101:07.94]Sir, can I have the mic?
[101:09.02]Nah, you don't have to give it to me.

[105:15.74]This mustache shirt guy has been doing a lot of fucking weird shit.
[105:24.28]That can't be right.
[105:26.85]Right here.
[105:32.62]I was gonna do a routine where I shake my balls.

[106:01.97]Skyrim, but everyone is me.
[106:08.77]I made things happen.
[106:10.15]I raised taxes on everybody.
[106:12.35]Every single person now owes 40% more taxes.
[106:14.93]That means more money for the kingdom.
[106:17.84]Oh, yeah.
[106:23.04]Well, it's not the common cold.
[106:25.20]I unfortunately have to diagnose you with cringe.
[106:29.19]What's that?
[106:31.39]What's that?
[106:32.09]What did you say?
[106:33.53]Okay.
[106:35.15]Feed him to the lions.
[106:38.01]Yeah, feed him.
[106:39.43]Feed him to the lions, don't you think?
[106:44.00]You're in trouble.
[106:45.18]You're in trouble.
[106:52.88]I have the power of God and anime on my side.
[106:59.67]What are those pictures in the background?
[107:01.15]Is that AI shit?
[107:27.54]Sire, get down.

[110:03.18]Green Goblin!
[110:11.06]Gotcha!
[110:14.45]That's not Green Goblin.
[110:17.13]Who's that new man?
[110:25.14]I'm crazy or not.
[110:26.10]This is all in your head.
[110:27.24]You're sick.
[110:27.82]Twisted.
[110:29.64]You're an pathetic psychopath.

[111:46.79]I'm doing Cookie Monster, not in Mario mode.
[111:48.89]Set reset.
[111:50.17]I'm glad so many people used the Mario Kart stuff.

[112:32.48]Well, let me just be the first to tell you that, you know, it's not fun when it's not totally via-hoo.
[112:37.21]What did they do to my head?
[112:38.85]Drugs and alcohol.

[113:16.58]And a one, two, three.
[115:24.78]The music ones are awesome.
[115:26.46]The reason why the music ones are so good is because they're kind of a nice interlude between the insanity.
[115:32.40]No, they're nice.
[115:33.62]Alright, let's catch our breath a little.
[115:36.08]That was awesome.

[123:59.02]Yeah!
[124:00.52]What the fuck is that?
[124:05.48]When I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely.
[124:17.11]So you're telling me this guy comes here every week?
[124:19.79]That person's a fucking weird person.
[124:22.29]Let's live in it.
[124:25.21]I've got my money.
[124:26.42]Let's spend it all.
[124:27.64]Onion rings.
[124:29.18]I've got an onion ring.
[124:31.84]What a psycho.
[124:32.76]Damn.
[124:34.09]absolute perfection no ifs ands or buts this fight here is absolute perfection that was fucking awesome
[125:00.05]If Dermot was Saw, gasp it with video, apparently.
[125:05.96]Okay?
[125:08.62]I'm interested.
[125:18.90]The door has just locked behind you.
[125:20.76]You thought this was a tour.
[125:22.98]Your test begins now.
[125:25.20]I know how much you don't like smelly smells.
[125:28.31]I know how much you think it's disgusting.
[125:30.26]Beetles and bugs.
[125:32.34]You wouldn't touch them when you were a child.
[125:33.82]But now you must.
[125:36.34]Because if you cannot be in this room for more than one minute, gas, gas, gas, the gas will start flowing.
[125:43.81]Only after you puke, Bill.
[125:44.91]I gotta make that really clear.
[125:46.01]I've been talking for a while.
[125:47.43]Only after you puke.
[125:48.79]If you puke into that toilet, gas will fill the room.
[125:52.77]Gas will fill the room.
[125:57.90]Make your choice.
[125:59.30]Will you stand the smelly smells for ten minutes?
[126:03.22]Or will you puke into the toilet?
[126:04.56]Filling the room with gas!
[126:05.30]Gas!
[126:05.42]Gas!
[126:05.50]Gas!
[126:41.03]Those are the best.
[127:11.20]That hurts a little.
[127:12.00]Is that supposed to feel like that?
[127:16.92]It feels... My whole face hurts.
[127:19.53]My face is burning.
[127:21.71]That burns a lot.
[127:23.89]What the... What is that?
[127:31.69]I feel actually alright.
[127:33.59]I feel warm.
[127:34.25]I feel really warm though.
[127:39.67]What was that?
[127:40.61]What was that?
[127:42.15]What was that?
[127:44.97]I'm going to lie down.
[127:47.39]I don't know who gave it to me.
[127:50.97]Why am I blue?
[128:05.44]Mm-mm.
[128:07.75]Is this all you have?
[128:08.93]No.
[128:09.79]You got another card back there.
[128:10.81]You're going to have to bring it in.
[128:15.81]That's it?
[128:16.61]Yes.
[128:17.01]How much?
[128:18.41]That's $49.
[128:18.93]Put your card in.
[128:22.84]Flip.
[128:23.12]It goes the other way.
[128:25.00]It goes the other way.
[128:25.76]The card reader, it goes the other way.
[128:27.20]You have a chip on it, right?
[128:28.96]You have a chip.
[128:29.66]The chip goes chip-facing in.
[128:32.42]How many stores have you been to in your whole life that you don't know the chip goes the other way?
[128:44.59]Peter and Harry?
[128:45.65]I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.
[128:55.23]Sire says that you're in big trouble, Harry.
[129:00.01]Oh, yes.
[129:01.89]Of course.
[129:03.73]Oh, he's very angry.
[129:05.59]Sire, sire.
[129:16.04]That was awesome.
[129:17.68]Pat, pass me the salt, please.
[129:19.00]No, no, no!
[129:45.87]What the fuck?
[129:47.29]Three, two, three, two, one.
[129:50.75]If I chop you in a meat grinder, the only thing that comes out and I've left with you is your eyeball.
[130:02.25]You're probably dead.
[130:04.93]If I would have put you in a meat grinder.
[130:22.43]That was awesome.
[130:25.23]Wait, there's another Truman Show?
[130:28.77]Edit?
[130:31.71]Okay.
[130:34.98]Those last two were awesome.
[130:37.16]Alright, here we go.
[130:37.86]Here comes Jeremiah in the Truman Show.
[130:39.86]I don't know if this is related.
[130:40.98]I don't think it is.
[130:45.21]Why don't you let me fix you some of this new mo cocoa drink?
[130:47.92]All natural cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua.
[130:51.14]No artificial sweeteners.
[130:53.62]Wait, how?
[130:55.74]What?
[130:56.96]I've tasted other cocos.
[130:58.72]This is the best.
[131:01.10]No.
[131:03.64]No.
[131:04.96]Wow.
[131:14.30]Wow.
[131:14.86]Spoilers for the movie.
[131:16.36]This is what it looks like up close.
[131:17.78]Yeah, I mean, you're going to get spoiled.
[131:19.61]From back there, it could have been anything.
[131:26.85]You can speak.

[131:30.58]Real funny stuff.
[131:33.54]You did this.

[140:51.40]You didn't signal when you went right, and that's the first thing that we're going to do here.
[140:54.28]By the way, if you get four or five points wrong here, your license is not going to come through.
[141:01.29]You can merge over here if you want to.

[156:48.21]The funniest part about that, it's like they're trying to show my eyes.
[156:51.75]Like, look, the angle of his eyebrow bone's different.
[156:54.41]His chin's a little different.
[156:55.63]It's sagging a little more after aging 10 fucking years.
[157:02.08]What they are describing in that meme is human aging.
[157:09.16]My face does look a little different.
[157:10.78]Of course it does.
[157:11.84]Because I was 25 to 36.
[157:12.38]Yeah, it's called human aging.
[157:21.67]It's called, my skin is a little saggier because I'm not 25 anymore.

[158:37.09]Yeah.
[158:37.33]Who's that?
[158:39.51]That's someone else.
[158:41.15]Harry Potter.
[158:42.93]Class is in session right now.
[158:44.59]I don't know.
[158:45.19]Looks like he's charging.
[158:47.82]And if you're going to use your wand, I might as well suggest you use it.
[158:56.70]You're a little shit, and you always were.
[158:59.43]But you didn't know, Harry, that I have lightning hands.
[159:02.29]Oh!

[159:18.81]I think I killed him.

[159:22.35]Harry, are you okay?
[159:23.69]Harry?
[159:25.83]The second half of the Spider-Man No Way Home movie felt like a college humor video.
[159:35.10]Not a bad opinion.
[159:36.98]But a part of me almost felt like some of the scenes in the new Spider-Man movie, like the director was just going to start walking around on the set.
[159:48.80]The room is about to fill with gas.
[159:52.79]And by the way, Spider-Man, the deal is not on the table anymore.
[160:32.75]Let me tell you something if somebody want to tell you to take drugs Always say no
[160:39.88]You see, Luigi tried to drink and do drugs one time.
[160:44.16]And I said, no.
[160:45.64]And he said, Mario.
[160:46.95]And I said, no.
[160:50.11]Peter Parker's here.
[161:01.45]Alright, hold on.
[161:02.87]People are saying, what the fuck?
[161:03.99]What's that opinion?
[161:04.77]Your opinion sucks.
[161:06.80]I'm just saying that the second half of No Way Home felt like a Saturday Night Live sketch.
[161:15.06]Like if I was waiting for the audience to laugh with like a laugh track.
[161:19.26]I'm sorry.
[161:20.22]I'm sorry.
[161:20.74]Did I like the movie?
[161:21.62]I thought the movie was fine.
[161:24.05]I'm a huge Spider-Man fan.
[161:27.03]I am a massive Spider-Man.
[161:28.33]Spider-Man's like my favorite character.
[161:29.41]Spider-Man and Venom.
[161:33.77]I almost felt like, maybe I said this before, but I'll say it again.
[161:36.27]It felt like at some points in that movie, they were going to look into the camera like Jim from The Office.
[161:42.29]It would have actually made more sense to me if Tobey Maguire sometimes just kind of looked in the camera.
[161:51.17]I thought the movie was fine.
[161:52.89]I liked the first two better.
[161:54.86]I liked the first one probably the best.
[161:58.60]The first one as in of that trilogy, right?
[162:04.23]Nice Reddit taste.
[162:07.09]It's just my opinion, okay?
[162:10.05]But it took me out of the movie a few times.
[162:16.37]I think you're wrong, so you suck.
[162:19.23]You are free.
[162:20.15]Look, I like the Venom movie, okay?
[162:24.39]I watched the Venom movie, and when I was done, I went, that was a good movie.
[162:28.46]I liked it.
[162:28.90]That was a good movie.
[162:30.78]Right?
[162:31.14]So, like, you could go, holy shit, dude, what a fucking moron.
[162:34.00]Right?
[162:34.66]That's fine.
[162:38.11]I mean, the Venom movie was a terrible movie, but I liked it.
[162:42.63]That's fine.
[162:43.57]You can think I'm stupid.
[162:44.31]That's fine.
[162:44.83]We all have our opinions on movies.
[162:48.25]Mine just happened to be correct.
[163:04.72]Hey, what's up?
[163:06.53]Heard you were talking about me and my kingdom.
[163:09.67]Just a little too, a little too harsh.
[163:12.63]No, this was welded with dragon bone.
[163:16.75]I don't know if you can tell by looking at that.
[163:21.18]I remember I was there when this, I almost fell backwards.
[163:25.22]I remember I was there when this was crafted in dragon blood.
[163:29.40]They call it dragon stone steel.
[163:33.49]You think you can handle that?
[163:35.33]You think you can handle that?
[163:36.93]Let's find out.
[163:38.05]You want to duel?
[163:39.20]You and me.
[163:40.76]Dragon bone steel.
[163:42.42]With whatever you have there.
[163:43.90]Whatever that is.
[163:44.56]What's that again?
[163:47.16]Stainless steel?
[163:48.56]Yeah.
[163:50.26]We all know how sturdy that is.
[163:53.04]Why don't you come over this way and let's see.
[163:55.18]Come on.
[163:58.76]Why don't you come here?
[164:09.71]That hurts a little.
[164:10.51]Is that supposed to feel like that?
[164:15.46]It feels... My whole face hurts.
[164:18.06]My face is burning.
[164:20.24]That burns a lot.
[164:22.42]What the... What is that?
[164:30.21]I feel actually alright.
[164:32.09]I feel warm.
[164:32.75]I feel really warm though.
[164:38.17]What was that?
[164:39.16]What was that?
[164:40.68]What was that?
[164:43.48]I'm going to lie down.
[164:45.90]I don't know who gave this to me.
[164:56.47]I was like, what's happening on the screen right now?
[165:07.28]Another player?
[165:08.92]You see what I got dealing with back here?
[165:11.12]You think I'm going to do that shit?
[165:12.92]No.
[165:13.66]You do it.
[165:15.13]You go do it.
[165:15.97]You deal with this.
[165:16.93]I'm not dealing with that.
[165:18.87]I may have caused it, but I'm not going to deal with it.
[165:20.95]You are.
[165:22.31]You're the one with the money.
[165:29.69]What does everybody gets drunk mean?
[165:34.37]Just about quarter to five and take a look at this viral video from... Another news viral video.
[165:51.16]Alright, Vivian Gomez wrote on Facebook that her security camera captured this on Sunday morning.
[165:56.99]There are people on Facebook who say it looks like Dobby from Harry Potter or a ghost or an alien or a kid in flip-flops and underwear.
[166:04.89]We think it looks like Lisa doing her Sunday morning dance.
[166:08.13]I don't know.
[166:08.43]Lisa, were you in La Junta on Sunday?
[166:10.35]I know she was out of town.
[166:11.38]Give it away.
[166:11.76]The video has been seen by 11 million people.
[166:15.54]That's going to be the new dance craze right there.
[166:20.81]Oh shit!
[166:23.05]What you see before you is a choice.
[166:25.12]A very important choice.
[166:30.00]One that will live with you forever.
[166:32.92]But you can make it.
[166:34.30]And you might be able to save yourself.
[166:37.78]I'm of course talking about drugs and alcohol.
[166:40.75]Hi, everyone.
[166:41.75]My name is Sean Elbertson.
[166:43.79]I play the character Jigsaw on the daytime TV show Jigsaw is Coming for You.
[166:50.09]I wanted to make sure I did this quick little PSA that we all have a choice to make, and that's drugs and alcohol.
[166:58.93]No reason to do that.
[167:00.49]Drugs is something if you ever approached and pressured, make your choice and say no.
[167:06.05]No to drugs.
[167:08.88]Thank you.
[167:16.93]Now let's get back to the show.
[167:22.75]I love the drug PSAs, they're so good.
[167:25.43]Wait, what?
[167:26.17]I didn't read that.
[167:28.01]Hey, hey, what's up?
[167:28.71]How are you?
[167:46.62]Yeah, I just moved in, yep.
[167:49.00]New to the neighborhood.

[167:55.09]Let me in your house, please.
[167:56.97]Can I come in?
[167:59.51]Oh, yeah, okay.
[168:01.45]Right, of course.
[168:03.03]I had some dental work done and... Can I come in?
[168:05.39]Can I just come in and move?
[168:08.16]I have to come in, though.
[168:09.14]Can I come in your house?
[168:10.44]No, sir.

[180:04.01]What you're failing to understand is the ball ache that we both had trying to get this from inside there to out here.
[180:11.01]That would make a lot of sense to me if there wasn't a giant red button.
[180:18.57]All the magic of mechanical garage doors.
[180:22.04]Yeah, OK.
[180:23.02]But how were we supposed to see the big red button when we were inside?
[180:27.87]You're right.
[180:28.49]A couple of idiots.
[181:14.92]Why am I muted?
[181:15.52]Wait, how did I just get muted?
[181:18.18]That was weird.
[181:19.06]I didn't press any buttons.
[181:21.88]How long have I been muted for?
[181:25.46]How long have I been muted for?
[181:34.08]Since the start of the video?
[181:36.34]Oh, shit.
[181:37.14]I was asking, like, where... The whole thing?
[181:40.70]What?
[181:40.98]I was just, like, ranting for two straight minutes.
[181:43.40]Why was I muted?
[181:44.12]Oh.
[181:45.30]Okay, I was saying, where am I?
[181:51.64]I was like, where am I?
[181:52.96]Why am I not in here?
[181:54.83]And then the mods were lighting up.
[181:57.41]It was like, just... This is not supposed to be here.
[182:03.63]Oh, okay.
[182:04.61]Alright, well, whatever.
[182:05.09]Let's go.
[182:07.04]This is just an ad for what we do in the shadows.
[182:09.74]It's just like a funny clip from the show.
[182:12.56]Is it?
[182:13.72]That's funny?
[182:26.17]Oh, shit.

[182:58.11]Where?
[183:00.12]We're in full 60 FPS.
[183:05.48]Not 30.
[183:06.34]Not the 30 bullshit.
[183:08.04]Are you ready?
[183:08.70]You don't look ready.
[183:23.27]I don't know who wins!
[183:25.35]I'm gonna say 2.
[183:35.74]2 was by far the most unhinged.
[183:37.76]Without a doubt.
[183:43.30]You're in trouble!
[183:46.14]You're in trouble!
[183:50.29]Bowser!

[184:25.88]I may have caused it, but I'm not going to deal with it.
[184:28.00]You are.
[184:28.82]I'm going to do it.
[184:29.66]You're the one with the money.
[184:33.08]I'm going to do it.
[184:34.48]I swear.

[185:08.26]It's a boom microphone.
[185:09.44]Isn't that funny?
[185:14.39]What was I talking about?
[185:19.23]Oh my god.

[185:35.02]Entire?
[185:35.76]I did a Boston accent for five seconds.
[185:38.12]I got rid of that.

[189:26.32]I'm sorry, I don't... I'm new in the neighborhood.
[189:29.00]Me and my family just moved in down the street.
[189:31.72]Okay, yeah.
[189:32.40]And I'm just trying to meet the neighbors.

[189:54.91]How do you get it that long?
[189:56.31]I don't know.
[189:56.77]Maybe you give some pointers.
[189:57.97]You can't come in my house.
[190:01.73]Can I come in your house?
[190:03.09]You've been here for an hour.

[190:14.68]Can I come in?
[190:16.42]No.
[190:18.42]I'll wait here until I can.
[190:20.62]No, it's all good.
[190:21.32]Don't worry about it.
[190:23.66]No, I'm alright.
[190:24.54]I barely sleep.
[190:31.65]What the fuck?

[191:39.51]Can I take a bite and will you guys get over this?
[191:43.80]If I take a bite of this, will you get over it?
[192:00.53]It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be.
[192:02.91]It tastes kind of like shit though.
[192:04.69]Wait a minute.
[192:15.32]Got it back.
[192:19.44]Alright, folks, take your seats.
[192:24.20]We're going to be starting here in just a moment.
[192:26.66]Who?
[192:28.14]Is it just the audio?
[192:30.59]We're going to be running a quick audio test, and then the show will begin shortly.
[192:33.71]Alright, ready?
[192:39.24]This is an audio test.
[192:41.72]What's up?
[192:43.16]Audio test.
[192:44.52]Testing the audio.
[192:46.46]I'm going to scream, so turn down your volume.
[192:48.44]I'm being dead serious.
[192:51.60]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[192:54.23]That was probably horrible.
[192:56.27]I just got these microphones like fucking a day ago.
[193:01.20]My apologies to everyone.
[193:02.48]We have no idea who that guy was.
[193:04.82]I'm sure we'll get that sorted.
[193:07.54]Our first performers of the night are the Banana Bros.
[193:16.80]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[193:17.72]Thank you.
[193:18.16]Thanks for coming out.
[193:20.03]Yeah.
[193:21.25]We got a new song that we're going to play.
[193:22.53]I learned this one when I was traveling.
[193:25.21]Abroad, right?
[193:29.24]Alright, yeah, we're gonna play a new song.
[193:30.56]This one is something we've been working on for a long time.
[193:33.02]I hope you all enjoy it.
[193:34.10]It doesn't have a name, it's currently untitled, so that's what we're gonna do.
[193:39.14]It's an untitled song, and I hope you enjoy it.
[193:41.80]Maybe you can help us come up with a title after the end of the show.
[193:44.50]It's gonna be peppy, it's gonna be a lot of upbeat, so hopefully see somebody out there dancing.
[193:49.49]Okay?
[193:52.89]And a one, two, a one, two, three, four.
[194:10.41]Holy shit.
[194:39.83]It sounds like before a band, an orchestra starts playing.
[194:43.29]Don't splash me.
[194:44.13]Don't splash me.
[194:45.05]Thank you.
[194:45.53]Thank you so much.
[194:48.19]Before we walked in.
[194:49.41]No, sit down.
[194:50.19]Easy, easy.
[194:50.91]Thank you.
[194:51.47]Wow.
[194:51.83]That's broken up.
[194:53.46]We've been working on that for like, what, two weeks?
[194:56.46]Three weeks now.
[195:08.37]Yeah, John, John came up with the lyrics.
[195:12.47]What the fuck?
[195:14.57]Am I late?
[195:17.99]On September 22nd, 2007, the Elbertson Three were planned to perform at the Sus Grill, a local bar in Conchester.
[195:25.38]It was also on this night that they decided to film all their performances, having the Elbertson Three also in this compilation.
[195:31.51]What you're about to watch now is the real tape of their performance.
[195:37.44]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[195:38.34]Thank you.
[195:38.94]Thanks for coming out.
[195:40.18]We got a new song that we're going to play for you here.
[195:42.54]A new song?
[195:43.80]For context, it was the previous year where they released their commercially failed album in the dollhouse.
[195:49.33]So hearing new music come out is exciting for some of the people in the crowd.
[195:53.86]I hope you all enjoy it.
[195:55.68]It doesn't have a name, it's currently untitled, so... That's what we're gonna do!
[195:59.98]It's an untitled song, and I hope you enjoy it.
[196:02.62]Maybe you can help us come up with a title after the end of the show.
[196:05.37]Another thing the crowd noted was the absence of the lead singer, Jeremy, making only two on stage.
[196:11.45]However, in a Twitter post from earlier that day, it was confirmed he wouldn't be coming down due to sickness.
[196:16.79]And so, the two instrumental team would shortly begin.
[196:22.21]And a one, two, one, two, three, four.
[196:27.57]It was terrible.
[196:28.41]Okay.
[196:30.01]The crowd was so very shocked by what they were hearing right now.
[196:33.29]Not real music.
[196:42.49]Absolutely terrible.
[196:45.50]Nothing about this.
[196:47.48]Not one thing.
[196:48.89]It was time for them to get off the stage, but not before doing this.
[196:56.48]Jeremiah was struck over the head by Jeremy's guitar.
[197:00.64]Crowd goers were obviously frightened by this obdication, and now you could see an unconscious Jeremiah laying on the floor as the cameras are shut off.
[197:13.83]And the interviews would begin.
[197:15.71]What a pain in the ass it was.
[197:17.19]I was in the chair.
[197:18.03]I was in there for, I was probably what?
[197:19.99]Five, 10 minutes straight.
[197:21.35]Just add the TikTok UI to that whole thing.
[197:26.17]And it'll be a fucking 10 out of 10.
[197:27.67]It'll be a literal 10 out of 10.
[197:29.81]And add music to it.
[197:31.13]I'm coming for you.
[197:32.08]You're the one I'm going to get.
[197:33.16]Are you coming back to this group?
[197:34.48]No.
[197:35.48]Okay.
[197:35.82]What if you were?
[197:36.38]No.
[197:37.26]What if you were offered a free?
[197:38.84]No.
[197:40.90]Absolutely not.
[197:42.02]Okay.
[197:42.24]No, I ain't going to do it.
[197:43.20]Alright.
[197:43.84]No, sorry.
[197:44.93]How much did you have to pay to get in?
[197:46.33]$12.
[197:46.35]$12?
[197:46.37]That's right.
[197:50.05]Wow, alright.
[197:51.33]I'm assuming you really enjoyed that offer of $12?
[197:57.91]That's equivalent to like a pack of cigarettes, $12.
[198:01.57]That costs way, way less than that.
[198:03.59]Really?
[198:05.37]Even the manager of the Elbertson 3 came out to get an interview.
[198:09.07]You deal with this, I'm not dealing with that.
[198:11.99]I may have caused it, but I'm not going to deal with it.
[198:14.05]You are.
[198:14.69]And in the matter of a day, the Elbertson three were absolutely abolished.
[198:22.91]That was crazy.
[198:23.66]That was a good one.
[198:29.72]There's been so many good ones that it's hard to even say that was a good one, right?
[198:33.70]That was a great one among great ones.
[198:36.72]It's hard to even decide what's a great one.
[198:38.85]They're all great.
[198:39.53]It's crazy.
[198:41.89]The quality of the submissions has been just too high.
[198:46.01]It's been so high.
[198:47.12]Alright, this is Jerma Combat.
[198:55.10]It's warping time.
[198:56.18]I'm supposed to be discovering fire?
[199:01.58]This is inappropriate.
[199:08.58]You know, I heard this is the scariest ride in parkour.
[199:13.22]That was the good one.
[199:14.86]I'm not scared though, are you scared?
[199:19.29]Yeah, I bet you are.
[199:20.69]I bet you're scared.
[199:22.09]I'm not scared at all.
[199:41.63]Hey, you can see the whole park from here, can you see?
[199:46.22]Okay, this is really high, huh?
[200:02.58]Why does every wooden roller coaster do this shit?
[200:13.02]Yeah.
[200:13.54]Hey, what's up?
[200:15.51]Heard you were talking about, uh, me and my kingdom.
[200:18.63]Just a little too, a little too harsh.
[200:19.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[200:20.77]That's what I hear.
[200:21.83]Shut up.
[200:22.49]You want a duel?
[200:23.17]Shut up.
[200:23.65]You and me?
[200:25.17]Dragon, bow, and steel.
[200:26.43]Shut up.
[200:26.87]With whatever you have there.
[200:28.33]Whatever that is.
[200:28.97]What's that again?
[200:31.60]Stainless steel?
[200:32.28]Yeah.
[200:32.98]Yeah.
[200:33.86]We all know how, we all know how sturdy that is.
[200:35.64]Shut the fuck up.
[200:36.30]Why don't you come over this way and let's see?
[200:39.04]Shut up.
[200:39.64]Come on.
[200:39.96]I have the power of God and anime on my side.
[200:44.59]Oh my god.
[200:47.11]Come on, do it already!
[201:00.54]Let's go.
[201:01.16]You can't just stand here all day and do nothing.
[201:15.63]Duel of the DMCA.
[201:30.74]I mean, it's DMC.
[201:33.84]We're trying to avoid it, but, you know.
[201:37.32]The VOD for these two streams are just probably not even going to be available anywhere.
[201:42.11]It's going to be really hard.
[201:43.89]I know that the Archive channel has worked on it, but, you know, it's tricky.
[201:50.23]It's tricky with the amount of copywritten material.
[201:54.93]But, we continue.
[201:57.59]Jeremy watches TV.
[202:17.07]I see something horrible.
[202:20.43]Come closer, come closer.
[202:23.04]A dire thing will happen to you.
[202:26.88]You will spill your water on the table, and it will drip, drip, drip over the edge down to the ground.
[202:34.58]Next weekend, you're gonna get invited to a party on Facebook.
[202:39.68]You're gonna say maybe, and you're gonna be kind of excited to go.
[202:44.77]But they're going to cancel.
[202:46.49]They're going to cancel it.
[202:49.35]Oh, yup.
[202:50.01]That one is bad.
[202:52.03]Hot, hot, hot.
[202:55.15]What the fuck?
[202:56.95]You know what's not funny?
[203:03.06]Something that's not completely via who.
[203:06.26]Drugs and alcohol.

[203:24.12]Now!
[203:58.46]I don't- what's the context of this one?
[204:13.63]This is, okay, this is literally just a shitty that somebody got last second from a bag.
[204:19.51]This is gonna be fucking loud.

[205:25.41]Nice job.
[205:26.29]Finny, your turn.
[205:27.81]I shoot the one in the middle.
[205:29.49]Roll to hit.
[205:32.91]Shit, natural one.
[205:42.78]Jerma, your go.

[206:20.63]Wait.
[206:21.61]Where are the miniatures?
[206:24.97]What the fuck?
[206:29.23]Okay, that took me to almost the end of the video to realize that those were AI voices, especially Critical's.
[206:34.97]I thought Critical did a thing where he did like a D&D thing.
[206:37.53]That was convincing.
[206:48.79]Wow.
[206:49.13]That's insane.
[206:54.76]I've got some good news.
[206:57.12]Shut up.
[206:57.95]Guess what?
[206:58.31]I am very much unhappy.
[207:00.71]No, really.
[207:01.05]I don't want you to guess.
[207:07.33]What are you doing?
[207:11.89]Shut up.
[207:12.61]What?
[207:13.23]Shut up.
[207:13.97]I know for a fact.
[207:14.65]Shut the fuck up.
[207:15.69]I'm sorry.
[207:16.33]Please don't speak to me like that.
[207:17.63]I'm simply saying.

[207:38.85]What the fuck?
[207:49.72]Good afternoon.
[207:52.16]My name is, uh... My name was not Borden, actually.
[207:57.88]Ugh.
[208:00.59]I want to make this video really quickly to say, uh... Hello!
[208:06.75]It's me, Mario.
[208:08.41]I have to do a drug PSA.
[208:10.63]Okay.
[208:11.84]Let me tell you something about drugs.
[208:14.46]Mario tried to pressure to do drugs one time, and I said, no!
[208:19.68]You should never take any drugs.
[208:22.02]Never.
[208:22.40]Mario wouldn't.
[208:23.30]Luigi wouldn't.
[208:24.52]Toad... Drugs.
[208:29.42]Stay away from them.
[208:31.51]If somebody tries to pressure you into drinking or smoking, tell them with the hardest of hearts, no, I don't need to do that.
[208:42.21]We can get back to the playing and games now.
[208:50.48]Let me check and see.
[208:51.14]I think we're getting down to the end here, I think.
[208:54.16]Let me check to see.
[208:55.88]We have... Okay.
[208:58.72]We're getting down to the final 25 videos.
[209:04.53]There are 25 videos left.
[209:09.55]Just so you know, we're down to 25.
[209:20.52]Hold on.
[209:20.96]Let me get this over here.
[209:21.76]Okay.
[209:26.39]Here we go.
[209:26.89]Final 25 videos.
[209:28.01]Let's go.
[209:33.30]What is this?
[209:33.82]Spider-Man.
[209:39.66]Enjoy everyone else on Spider-Man now.
[210:29.48]You're probably wondering why you're here.
[210:33.44]What you're doing locked up down here.
[210:37.65]Six weeks ago, you had over 40 Pornhub tabs open.
[210:41.67]You crashed your computer.
[210:44.99]So now, you have 40 computers with 40 different porn videos on them.
[210:51.74]You need to go and close them all before the knock on the door of your mother finds you.
[210:59.50]You have one minute.
[211:02.60]Make your choice.
[211:04.72]Which one?
[211:05.12]Which one do I start with first?
[211:05.92]This one over here.
[211:11.17]Oh no!
[211:39.65]Shut the fuck up, you fucking cunt!
[212:11.84]That was good.
[212:17.85]What was that?
[212:21.91]What was that?
[212:22.63]Hold on.
[212:23.11]What was that one?
[212:26.87]What the fuck was that?
[212:29.17]I'm actually so confused.
[212:30.39]Was that part of a different video?
[212:50.64]Well off to visit your mother My first Mario Kart win

[217:23.61]I exited the fucking game.
[217:24.87]No, I didn't.
[217:25.35]I'm still in.
[217:28.71]Close the door!
[217:29.45]Alright, I'm good.
[217:30.83]I can't believe I actually played this on stream.

[220:27.57]Air to the what?
[220:56.37]There's something wrong with your fans' brains.
[220:59.86]Why are you saying that?
[221:01.08]That was like incredibly well done, detailed in the music.
[221:04.14]It flowed perfectly.
[221:04.94]What are you talking about?
[221:08.86]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let me check.
[221:11.14]We are getting down.
[221:14.81]There are about 15 or so left.
[221:22.53]We're getting to the final 15.
[221:27.33]Ever.
[221:27.79]Well, not ever, but, you know, for today.
[221:31.25]Let's go.
[221:37.53]Oh, yes, I love the MasterChef ones.
[221:39.70]Down to 10.
[221:40.14]And this is what you bring?
[221:44.22]Coke.
[221:45.08]This is the most important dish of your life, guys.
[221:46.80]You see this?
[221:49.04]This is... Hi, Bob.
[221:57.03]Hey, Mom, I'm on TV.
[221:58.11]I'm sorry.
[221:58.45]I'm sorry.
[221:58.71]Can I have the mic?
[222:00.07]Nah, you don't have to give it to me.
[222:01.41]I'm on TV, Ma.
[222:02.53]Look at me.
[222:03.01]I'm on TV.
[222:04.13]JAMA.
[222:04.91]Yes, Chef.
[222:06.04]Stay there for a minute.
[222:07.64]Yeah, I'm currently trying to make sure that I have enough of the seasoning on here.
[222:11.98]Just step back.
[222:13.88]Look at the mess.
[222:17.68]But it takes up so much less space.
[222:19.42]It's not in one space.
[222:20.56]It's from there all the way down and all over the place.
[222:23.32]Look at the cupboard.
[222:24.34]Let me tell you one more thing.
[222:26.62]If you were in any of our kitchens, you'd been fired six months ago.
[222:30.51]Dude, I looked over here, and it's a mess over here.
[222:34.61]There's like 75 items over here.
[222:37.47]And then I'm looking over here.
[222:39.19]There's a door right there, and there's a big exit sign.
[222:42.83]I'm just looking back and forth like...
[222:47.12]Oh, me.
[222:51.18]That is a disaster.
[222:55.25]Bring it up.
[222:56.85]What is that?
[222:57.83]What I made for you today is I have a creamy mushroom risotto and a side of creamy broccoli risotto with a hint, a small portion of a creamy chicken risotto.
[223:08.64]And then on the side of that, I also have two pork chops that I have created and I seared to perfection and then finished off.
[223:14.90]And it's served on a bed of raw flour, right?
[223:17.84]Yes, Chef.
[223:22.42]I actually just had it before you did.
[223:25.78]I just had some before you did.
[223:28.50]I may have undercooked it.
[223:31.24]It's not good?
[223:36.79]What do you mean it's not good?
[223:40.27]It's a perfect risotto.
[223:41.69]It's perfect.
[223:48.32]You work in a mess, you produce a mess.
[223:51.44]I'm struggling to identify what the hell you're doing.
[223:54.15]I really am.
[223:58.17]You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.
[224:01.29]You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows.
[224:04.51]You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows, and I'm not gonna stand for it.
[224:09.12]I've had enough.
[224:10.88]I've had enough!
[224:12.34]I'm not leaving.
[224:13.48]No, I think I deserve to win.
[224:15.26]Get out!
[224:16.38]Out!
[224:25.45]Whatever.
[224:26.17]I f*** this competition.
[224:27.37]I don't care.
[224:36.65]Dude, somebody in the chat was saying, why would somebody make a risotto pizza?
[224:41.74]Risotto pizza, Omega Lull.
[224:46.34]That just kept popping in my head and just doing it.
[224:52.16]Let's go.
[224:58.32]I'm killing you.
[224:59.42]I'm killing you.
[225:00.40]And here I come!
[225:01.62]I'm gonna smash your fucking head with a mallet like Gallagher used to.
[225:12.99]I'm gonna put you in a meat grinder!
[225:36.42]That game was awesome.
[225:37.60]It was really hard though.
[225:39.10]Nice.
[226:19.05]That's awesome.
[226:26.31]They changed the clothes.
[226:56.55]Ooh, excuse me!
[227:01.31]Yabba dabba doo!
[227:01.95]Look at me!
[227:02.85]Look at me!
[227:03.51]Yeah, that's what you sound like.
[227:04.81]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[227:09.29]Bam!
[227:10.22]Die, you motherfucker!
[227:13.00]There it is.
[227:13.60]Fucking bones!
[227:21.44]Ow!
[227:21.62]Boink!
[227:33.86]Damn.
[227:40.67]I'm not even winded.
[227:47.29]Bug Dr. MD.
[227:48.45]Just got done with a quick bike ride.
[227:53.04]Kickstand.
[227:54.32]Comes in.
[227:55.00]Just like sweat just glistening off his forehead.
[227:59.10]So, what brings you in today?
[228:02.72]Well, I have a little bit of a headache.
[228:07.18]It's kind of like a migraine-esque kind of deal I got going on here.
[228:11.03]One second.
[228:13.35]Takes the bike helmet off and just tears.
[228:16.09]It's like at least 16 to 20 inches of hair.
[228:20.11]It pulls up the license.
[228:22.07]60, by the way.
[228:25.31]And I'm like, oh, wow, look at that crazy thing.
[228:27.65]Wow, you got a lot of hair.
[228:28.89]Yeah.
[228:30.35]I haven't had a headache, by the way, in a long time.
[228:36.35]You want to eat some bugs?
[228:37.27]Final Fantasy V?
[228:52.83]We haven't seen a Slytherin mustache guy in a while.
[229:37.82]Lightning hands!
[230:08.70]Hello boys and girls!
[230:17.90]It's twerking time!
[230:26.27]Suck a fart out of my ass!
[230:59.43]Oh, hey, what's going on?
[231:00.29]How are you doing?
[231:03.48]Wait, are you summoning... Watch out!
[231:23.35]Oh, I thought the video froze.
[231:24.59]Oh.
[231:40.90]That was awesome.
[231:42.66]Hi chefs.
[231:48.43]What I made for you today is I have a creamy mushroom risotto and a side of creamy broccoli risotto with a hint, a small portion of a creamy chicken risotto.
[232:04.16]Is that normal?
[232:06.44]Amazing Bazzini's risotto.
[232:08.69]Wow, that's extraordinary, no?
[232:12.25]Yeah.
[232:12.75]It doesn't even move.
[232:17.07]Well, I mean.
[232:19.07]Well, maybe that'll look better up there.
[232:23.37]Yeah.
[232:25.31]It fits the colors.
[232:30.03]Come on.
[232:36.17]I'm a mess and absolutely disgusting.
[232:39.35]And that's what my mom taught me, you know?
[232:42.76]It just tastes of mush.
[232:44.88]It's not good?
[232:45.44]It's just so bland.
[232:48.48]Honestly, I mean, it's just greasy.
[232:50.18]What do you mean it's not good?
[232:52.52]It's a perfect risotto.
[232:53.92]It's perfect.
[232:54.62]The crap and the gunk on top of it is just hideous.
[232:56.70]It's a perfect risotto.
[232:57.96]It looks like refried beans.
[233:01.89]You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.
[233:05.12]Unbelievable.
[233:06.50]Now I know the problem.
[233:08.34]You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows.
[233:12.13]You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows.
[233:14.79]And I'm not going to stand for it.
[233:16.85]I'm not leaving.
[233:18.47]Get out of here!
[233:29.73]Melted ice cream.
[233:30.69]Creepy mushroom risotto and you don't have a fucking pallet to save your life, you fucking idiot.
[233:36.95]Yeah, why am I leaving?
[233:46.08]It's so good.
[233:47.98]It's so good.
[233:48.76]Whatever.
[233:49.16]I fuck this competition.
[233:50.66]I don't care.
[233:55.25]Alright, so people saying, why do you only know what risotto is?
[234:01.62]No, but in every one of these shows, in every one of the competitions, they're always like, oh, of course I have a creamy mushroom risotto.
[234:07.30]It's like they always do that.
[234:08.78]It's just like the thing that they all make on every episode.
[234:11.03]There's always a risotto.
[234:13.35]There's always a risotto.
[234:14.39]Okay, volume 985, Jeremy Catalog.
[234:45.11]Hey, hey, how are you doing, man?
[234:46.13]Good to see you again.
[234:46.89]How's it going?
[234:47.41]Hey, what's up, dude?
[234:47.95]Nothing much.
[234:48.99]How are you doing?
[234:49.59]No, nothing.
[234:50.07]I'm just curious as to why you're like the worst streamer on Twitter.
[234:52.05]Oh, is that what you think?
[234:52.83]You think that's what you think?
[234:53.91]You fucking...
[235:15.92]Thank you.
[235:46.84]What a god.
[235:52.39]You got something to say?
[236:02.87]I'm gonna leave.
[236:04.59]I'm gonna leave.
[236:05.47]I'm gonna leave.
[236:06.41]I'm gonna leave.
[236:17.97]We could stop at five or six different stores.
[236:22.41]Just one.
[236:29.06]Oh, now we're to Mario.
[236:30.52]Here we go.
[236:31.18]A scary one.
[236:34.70]No, it's me.
[236:35.76]We're back in a fun Mario one now.
[236:40.27]This game is sick by the way.
[236:41.81]Mario Yahtzee.
[237:14.66]Good block.
[237:15.58]Perfect dodge.
[237:39.88]And somebody like T-Bowser needs to understand.
[237:43.05]Boys and girls, don't do drugs.
[237:45.97]If you do drugs, you'll end up like T-Bowser.
[237:50.34]Dad, boy, the West and the West.
[238:11.70]Bowser!
[238:12.29]It's a Bowser!
[238:50.22]Not this fucking level.
[238:51.32]No!
[238:54.55]It's me, Mario!
[238:56.05]Okay.
[238:57.05]I'm done.
[238:58.17]I can't.
[238:59.25]I can't do it.
[239:00.71]I can't.
[239:00.95]That was it.
[239:01.51]That was the end.
[239:06.71]Remember the window cleaner?
[239:16.21]Hi, Bob.
[239:17.73]Hey, Bob, I'm on TV.
[239:19.57]Oh, I'm on the television.
[239:21.55]Channel 2.
[239:23.16]I'll leave.
[239:24.04]I'll leave.
[239:25.12]I'll leave, but... Whoa, hey.
[239:26.36]Hey.
[239:27.10]Hey, you can see the whole park from here.
[239:28.48]Can you see?
[239:28.90]No, I ain't gonna scream.
[239:30.02]That's crazy.
[239:30.78]You're gonna scream.
[239:31.96]I feel like I'm at an audition right now.
[239:33.40]There's, like, three people with clipboards over there, and they're just, like, judging every word I'm saying.
[239:40.60]Again?
[239:41.20]Really?
[239:41.82]You're going to do this again?
[239:42.89]You did this, and you can fix it too, you know.
[239:45.91]Words cannot even comprehend how it... Sire says you're about to be in very big trouble.
[239:50.33]Oh, you've got a mouth on you, don't you?
[239:51.81]Oh, he's very angry.
[239:53.43]Sire, Sire, he's angry.
[239:55.19]I'm coming down there, and I'm going to fuck you up.
[239:56.89]Hey, come on out here, because there's bugs everywhere.
[239:58.54]I don't like when the bugs... Mind the red truck.
[240:01.58]Use your eyes.
[240:02.80]Dude, is there something on me?
[240:03.76]Is there something on my back?
[240:05.36]Is there something on my back?
[240:06.36]Just tell me.
[240:06.96]Zombies!
[240:08.18]Get it, get it, get it.
[240:10.12]Oh my God, it's huge.
[240:11.12]Dude, it's huge.
[240:12.26]Would you like to see the notes?
[240:13.83]You can see it if you want.
[240:14.71]Would you like to see what I've written down?
[240:15.83]Go ahead and look.
[240:17.37]Do you see what's in front of us?
[240:18.45]You do, right?
[240:19.31]No human drives a car like this.
[240:21.91]You're not getting your license today, by the way.
[240:24.23]Make that very clear.
[240:25.19]Uh-oh.
[240:34.65]Damn.
[240:35.55]Damn.
[240:37.29]Lúcio.
[240:41.33]Behind the red truck.
[240:43.65]Alright.
[240:43.85]Where are we?
[240:49.01]We're down to the final.
[240:50.53]Oh, man.
[240:50.91]The final, like, seven.
[240:51.93]No, there are eight.
[240:55.73]There are eight remaining.
[240:59.56]This one is called Lúcio Malfoy's First Lesson.
[241:02.54]I wonder what it is.
[241:10.32]Okay, he's alright.
[241:11.32]He's fine.
[241:11.90]He's fine.
[241:12.52]Everyone's laughing.
[241:13.40]It's fine.
[241:13.97]It's okay.
[241:16.91]Why is the professor wearing a clown shirt?
[241:20.67]Hello, students.
[241:21.61]Welcome to the Defense of the Dark Arts class.
[241:28.00]My name is Lucien Malfoy.
[241:31.04]I'm the new teacher in town.
[241:33.00]Hey, you and me, you're evil too, right?
[241:36.18]We're probably going to be really good friends.
[241:38.54]Uh-uh.
[241:40.40]If we could all open up your textbooks and go to page 200, please.
[241:46.06]Yes, yes.
[241:47.28]Ron, please.
[241:49.16]There's nothing in here about using defensive spells.
[241:51.15]Page 200, we're going to be making a frog breath potion.
[241:56.03]You know all about that, don't you, Harry?
[241:58.57]The one you used when you killed Lucius?
[242:05.24]Shut up, Malfoy.
[242:10.58]I'm in the middle of teaching, Harry.
[242:12.22]That's not the time to use that spell.
[242:14.54]And how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?
[242:17.56]Didn't they ever tell you you only use that spell if you mean to kill another wizard?
[242:22.59]And yes, I'm aware that your old teacher has perished.
[242:29.47]Dr. McGillicuddy.
[242:30.49]It was murder.
[242:31.23]Voldemort killed him.
[242:32.07]You must know.
[242:32.49]Now you're going to be floating in the air.
[242:38.97]Down.
[242:42.15]Well, class, it's been a pleasure, absolute pleasure.
[242:45.58]But you all don't understand the power of the Dark Lord.
[242:50.18]And for that reason, I'm out.
[242:53.23]Just like that show Shark Tank.
[243:08.22]You're a little shit, and you always were.
[243:12.48]But you didn't know, Harry, that I have lightning hands!
[243:17.26]Oh!
[243:27.38]You have no idea what's in store for you, Harry.
[243:30.14]Me and Malfoy are going to destroy you.
[243:42.34]I just hit him right in the skull.
[243:44.14]I just cracked his skull.
[243:52.06]Oh, that was a good one.
[243:54.89]That was really good.
[243:57.77]Frog's Breath Potion.
[244:00.53]Imagine dying to Frog's Breath Potion.
[244:02.63]How would that even fucking hurt you?
[244:05.77]That doesn't make any sense.
[244:07.81]How would that even, how would that hurt you?
[244:10.15]What is that?
[244:10.59]What is that?
[244:11.15]What spell is that?
[244:11.71]What potion is that?
[244:13.75]That killed, wow, what a terrible wizard you were.
[244:15.91]What a shitty wizard.
[244:18.69]You died from a frog's breath?
[244:20.03]That's like the joke, cartoon, goofy part of the movie.
[244:23.87]When it's like, oh, I got bad breath.
[244:26.30]That killed Lucius Malfoy?
[244:28.26]What a shit wizard.
[244:33.26]Okay, let's go.
[244:39.03]I'm on the way to work right now.
[244:40.41]No!
[244:40.49]Why don't you come here?
[245:07.43]Come on.
[245:07.63]Come on!
[245:08.03]Do it already!
[245:09.13]Let's go.
[245:09.87]We can't just stand here all day, dude.
[245:11.58]I got shit to do.
[245:12.28]Come on.
[245:13.94]Hey, who wants coffee?
[245:24.85]I got coffee.
[245:25.37]I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.
[245:48.80]It's amazing.
[245:50.98]See that again.
[245:52.28]I'm sorry, we have to see that again.
[246:05.56]This one has flashing lights and blinking lights, flashing sounds and lights.
[246:11.77]Just so you're aware.
[246:12.43]Okay, this is flashing lights.
[246:18.31]You ready?
[246:19.63]Flashing sounds.
[246:21.97]We're always striving to make you feel as comfortable as possible, which is why we have the complimentary breakfast and the pool.
[246:32.37]Also, a golf course.
[246:37.15]But don't take it from us.
[246:37.97]Is this a bunch of stock footage?
[246:39.03]Take it from this testimonial from our esteemed guest.
[246:56.67]Wherever life takes you, we are there.
[247:00.24]Best Western.
[247:05.82]What is going on?
[247:27.53]I'm just hanging out.
[247:30.59]Who's talking?
[247:31.27]What are you up to?
[247:34.15]How are you?
[247:35.41]How are you?
[247:36.25]Good to see you.
[247:37.21]Oh, I'm clean now.
[247:40.43]Clean Andy.
[247:40.97]Prove it.
[247:41.27]You gotta prove it.
[247:42.57]Okay.
[247:43.68]I'll prove it.
[247:44.97]Alright.
[247:45.59]I didn't tweet yet.
[247:46.21]I have to send a message.
[247:49.23]What I thought you were saying is pour ice down your pants.
[247:53.48]Prove that I was just in the shower.
[247:54.72]There it is.
[247:56.42]No more face cam.
[247:57.44]Not today.
[247:58.64]Don't see the stupid face burned onto their thousand dollar TV.
[248:02.46]What do I do?
[248:03.02]My dad saw a video of yours.
[248:06.85]He had a heart attack.
[248:10.09]No.
[248:10.53]No.
[248:10.67]We're not going down this road.
[248:12.57]It's literally just a wall, dude.
[248:13.69]It's gonna live a long time.
[248:14.85]It might.
[248:16.71]What was the last thing I did?
[248:18.11]I gave tablets.
[248:18.67]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[248:19.55]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[248:20.37]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[248:22.51]Good.
[248:23.19]Excellent.
[248:23.51]Peep the horror.
[248:26.14]I don't have that image anymore.
[248:30.84]There we go.
[248:32.14]You want to peep the horror?
[248:33.22]Here.
[248:37.18]Oh, shit.
[248:57.17]Holy shit.
[249:15.35]That was fucking crazy.
[249:17.96]That one was awesome.
[249:23.00]That was really good.
[249:25.48]That's a clap for that one.
[249:29.56]Alright.
[249:29.82]Jerma985 attempts to survive in Vampire Survivors.
[249:31.65]Okay.
[249:39.37]Are you ready?
[249:41.85]Oh, that was disgusting.
[249:45.65]It's warping time.
[249:47.11]Huh.
[249:50.84]Huh?
[249:52.30]No.
[249:53.02]No.
[249:53.60]No, I'm sorry.
[249:54.04]No.
[249:54.14]I ain't gonna do it.
[249:56.00]No.
[249:57.76]No, fuck you.
[249:59.37]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[250:07.31]Alright.
[250:09.26]Dermo 101.
[250:32.94]Alright, that's enough, that's enough.
[250:42.79]You got an F?
[250:44.43]And you're not gonna get your license.
[250:54.20]This can't be, this can't be right.
[251:04.30]Wait, what did that say?
[251:06.01]What did that say?
[251:07.21]If I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing that comes out that's left of you is your eyeball, you're probably dead.
[251:19.93]My name is Lúcio Malfoy.
[251:22.95]I'm the new teacher in town.
[251:25.41]And yes, I'm aware that your old teacher has perished.
[251:33.79]Hold on, wait, wait, I want to go back.
[251:36.23]What did that say?
[251:36.99]Death note.
[251:42.69]2020 baseball stream.
[251:43.91]2021 baseball stream.
[251:44.71]July baseball stream.
[251:46.55]Hey, August baseball stream is not written down in here.
[251:51.67]I think we're fine.
[251:52.37]I think we're good.
[251:53.09]Alright, so the next one is Infinity War.
[251:58.22]Spoilers, like it matters, but okay.
[252:02.78]Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good.
[252:05.40]That was stupid.
[252:14.84]This tie is so long.
[252:17.58]Can you see this?
[252:18.38]I look like a 10-year-old wearing dad's suit to work.
[252:30.29]This is ridiculous.
[252:31.13]This shouldn't be like this.
[252:32.57]I feel like I'm two feet tall.
[252:34.70]I heard that the second game had four to five minute loading screens when you went outside or inside of a building.
[252:41.74]So that's why I never played it.
[252:45.65]True.
[252:50.81]Witches.
[252:57.20]I'll not drink with Weevil, those freaks.
[253:00.44]I'll take a drink.
[253:01.64]Beg your pardon for those thugs.
[253:03.15]Oh, you don't know who I am?
[253:05.35]Geralt of Rivia.
[253:07.99]You should know.
[253:10.81]Two orange juices.
[253:11.49]Freaks.
[253:12.45]I'm gonna drink one now, and one later.
[253:16.57]Thank you.
[253:21.85]Wait, hold on.
[253:23.01]Let me do my patented move that I do.
[253:24.87]Hey, you.
[253:37.54]Come here.
[253:42.18]That's right, you.
[253:43.42]Any witches?
[253:44.53]No, nothing.
[253:45.63]I just wanted to take you aside without cluing the others into what we're up to.
[253:50.55]Sneaking upstairs to make love.
[253:56.13]Heard you were a witch.
[253:59.54]I got a letter from the King of Rivia that said that you were a witch.
[254:06.64]I've never played this game.
[254:09.32]I've never played this game.
[254:10.70]I have never played any of the Witchers.
[254:13.52]Suddenly I have an immense desire to drink.
[254:18.45]Oh, I hate those motherfuckers.
[254:24.25]I think we're down to the final two.
[254:25.89]Let me check.
[254:30.10]Yeah, so we're down to the final three.
[254:33.36]There are three more.
[254:35.76]This one, one more, and one more.
[254:37.08]Here we go.
[254:38.06]Jerma gets a coffee.
[254:46.12]Hey, what's up, man?
[254:46.86]Hey, what's up?
[254:50.09]There's the cream.
[254:52.77]There's the sugar.
[254:53.69]There's the milk.
[254:55.79]Hey, what's up, bro?
[254:56.87]How you doing?
[254:57.79]I got a coffee for you.
[254:58.79]Brewed it right before you got in.
[255:00.57]I know your order.
[255:01.23]Come on.
[255:01.69]I don't know your order or not.
[255:04.13]Oh, shit!
[255:06.07]That's my new red.
[255:06.73]That's freshly brewed, by the way.
[255:08.49]Yep.
[255:17.96]What the hell?
[255:55.08]Hey, how you doing?
[256:09.32]That was good.
[256:09.96]That was a good one.
[256:13.46]Final two.
[256:18.08]Jerma BBQ.
[256:21.53]You flip, you flip, you flip, you flip, and you just wait for somebody to come tap you on the shoulder.
[256:27.68]Oh, hey, hey, Dad.
[256:31.38]Oh, there's the grill master.
[256:32.58]There he is, the grill master.
[256:33.92]Yeah, yeah.
[256:34.94]Because nobody else wants to fucking do it.
[256:39.54]So I do it.
[256:40.72]And I sit here all day.
[256:41.64]You're going to think I'm going to be back there.
[256:44.28]What's that?
[256:44.66]No.
[256:46.38]You're doing a great job out there, son.
[256:50.04]I love how much this- Oh my god.
[256:51.90]Oh my god.
[257:22.86]Alright.
[257:26.06]There is one more.
[257:28.10]Final one of the evening.
[257:39.70]Oh, my.
[257:40.22]Okay.
[257:42.18]Why did you put it?
[257:43.00]Alright.
[257:45.14]Okay.
[257:45.44]Everybody settle down.
[257:48.31]Settle down.
[257:49.07]They're sneaking them in.
[257:51.74]They're sneaking them in.
[257:52.78]This is the actually last one.
[257:56.44]Hello.
[257:58.62]Yeah.
[257:59.12]And guess what?
[257:59.76]You can hear me, huh?
[258:01.14]You can hear me pretty well.
[258:02.90]Not like it was before.
[258:05.08]Well, while this plays out in the background, we'll skip to a random place.
[258:11.37]Thank you.
[258:11.69]What was that?
[258:13.25]Everybody that gave any submissions.
[258:17.01]This is some of the best submissions we've ever seen.
[258:22.69]But yeah, incredible work.
[258:25.88]That's just about almost 250, 300 videos out of hundreds and hundreds of submissions.
[258:36.29]Yeah, I'm floored every time we do one of these just because of how good and how creative and how much actual time you guys put into these.
[258:45.24]Will green screen ever come back?
[258:48.12]I mean, it's tough to say because I have to be into it, right?
[258:53.25]The reason why I did it again was just because I got that urge to do it.
[258:57.67]And I have to want to get in front of that green screen because that's where I have the most fun.
[259:02.77]So it's just going to happen.
[259:03.73]It might just happen again.
[259:04.75]I don't know.
[259:06.69]But I never want to just be like, no, I'm going to do it next week.
[259:08.93]Because I've got to want to do it, right?
[259:12.01]Raise taxes on everybody.
[259:15.06]Thanks to anybody that participated, anybody that sent anything in.
[259:20.84]Yes, the playlist.
[259:21.76]There's two playlists.
[259:23.08]There's DLC and there's the original playlist.
[259:25.58]Both are going to be available for you to watch.
[259:27.76]And then for the other submissions, I don't know if there's anything going to happen with the other ones.
[259:34.37]It's tough to kind of be like, alright, should we do a third playlist and put it in the Discord or something?
[259:39.47]Or should we let people just put their work into the Discord?
[259:44.15]and maybe just share it with each other.
[259:46.49]Stuff like that might be something we might do, but obviously no guarantees or anything.
[259:53.28]But that was amazing.
[259:56.08]And everybody, get hype for baseball.
[260:00.54]That wasn't in the Death Note book.
[260:02.10]Alright, shut this guy off.
[260:08.38]August 19th.
[260:10.99]At 4.30 Pacific, that's this coming Friday, is the Jerma Baseball Association presents the California Circus versus the Maryland Magicians.
[260:23.66]It's going to be a full nine innings of baseball.
[260:25.88]I'm the only umpire in the whole game.
[260:29.12]It's going to be fucking wild.
[260:30.76]I'll just tell you that.
[260:32.14]So that's one I don't think I'd want to miss if I were you and I were here and I was watching this channel.
[260:38.28]The Jerma Baseball Association is a go.
[260:41.59]Friday, this Friday at 4.30 Pacific.
[260:56.75]I wonder who's going to win.
[260:57.73]I wonder who you guys are going to root for.
[261:00.89]Because they're both going to be awesome.
[261:04.76]So I'm incredibly excited for it.
[261:08.78]You know, every four or five months or so, once every six months, try to do something really extravagant.
[261:15.93]And this is one of those things.
[261:18.68]It should be a lot of fun.
[261:20.28]Hey, whatever happens, it will be fun to do regardless, so I hope you enjoy it.
[261:24.62]The next time you will see me will be on the Jerma Baseball Association stream August 19th again.
[261:31.30]Don't forget it.
[261:33.02]I'll tweet about it too.
[261:33.72]It's probably tomorrow or the next day.
[261:35.74]Type it up a little bit more.
[261:38.11]See you soon, though.
[261:40.23]Yeah, Grump will post the video playlists in the Discord too, probably, I would assume.
[261:49.27]That concludes the green screen movie night.
[261:54.51]The second one.
[261:58.68]What about the dog video?
[262:00.60]I don't know.
[262:03.40]Will there be baseball merch?
[262:04.50]Yes.
[262:05.50]There will be baseball merchandise around the show.
[262:08.80]I promise you that.
[262:16.08]I'll just keep the dog video in there.
[262:17.10]Why not?
[262:19.84]Yeah, who are you rooting for?
[262:21.61]I don't know.
[262:21.99]I think you have to wait until they're on screen before you find out who your favorite team is.
[262:27.07]It's going to be very, very hard for you to decide.
[262:31.45]So many people are like, oh, the circus, the clowns, oh yeah, the magicians.
[262:35.41]Well, just wait.
[262:37.43]Let the first hour of that stream happen before you figure that out.
[262:49.77]Have you been physically preparing for this?
[262:51.37]Yes.
[262:53.78]I have been physically preparing both mentally and physically because I need to know I've been studying umpire terminology and umpire rules and how to regulate and keep a baseball game going smoothly.
[263:14.47]Can we bet on who wins?
[263:16.93]Yeah, I'm sure we could do that at the beginning.
[263:19.29]The mods will be on top of it.
[263:20.29]Mods will just do it.
[263:22.92]Maybe before the game starts in the pre-show, while you guys are hanging out, maybe we can start one.
[263:30.04]That sounds like a plan.
[263:37.49]Is merch going to be after the stream?
[263:39.45]Yeah, it'll be after the stream is over.
[263:41.97]It'll be at 50% exactly.
[263:45.95]California Circus.
[263:47.88]Huh.
[263:52.59]Root for your team.
[264:08.05]Go, magicians, go.
[264:09.93]How long do nine innings take?
[264:12.69]Well, in a regular game of baseball, it could take somewhere between two and a half to three and a half hours, but this is not a regular baseball game.
[264:23.95]It's regular baseball, but it's not a regular game.
[264:29.29]That's all I'm going to say.
[264:31.70]But it's going to be nine innings.
[264:33.82]What will you do if it rains?
[264:35.24]Well, it's not going to rain.
[264:37.12]So stop saying that.
[264:38.25]We don't talk about rain.
[264:40.97]There's a rain delay in baseball.
[264:43.25]If it is raining, we wait.
[264:45.83]We will have to wait for a rain delay potentially.
[264:50.39]Or if it's light enough, we just go.
[264:53.79]People, they play baseball in the rain.
[264:56.08]I don't think it's going to rain.
[264:57.66]So don't worry.
[264:59.36]But there are plans in place.
[265:07.20]Are there going to be any special guests?
[265:08.86]No.
[265:10.28]That I can tell you for sure.
[265:17.98]What if it snows?
[265:18.84]That would be strange.
[265:23.32]No, there are no special guests.
[265:26.56]Unless you want to say that the baseball teams playing are the guests, which I would say yeah.
[265:30.61]So those are, I would say, special guests.
[265:38.63]What if the baseball stops working?
[265:41.21]We'll just get another one.
[265:50.68]Alright, that's it.
[265:52.78]Just show up on Friday.
[265:57.05]That's all I can tell you.
[265:59.81]What if the baseball won't fit?
[266:02.39]Everything's going to be fine.
[266:03.25]Just show up on Friday.
[266:05.73]With that, I'll see you later.
[266:08.71]Wish us luck in the pre-production here over the next week.
[266:13.77]There's a lot of moving parts on this show, kind of like we've described.
[266:17.75]It is a full baseball game with two full baseball teams.
[266:23.10]So there's a lot to do.
[266:24.58]So I'll talk to you guys soon.
[266:26.18]See you on Friday.
[266:26.84]Take care of yourselves.
[266:29.14]And good night.
[266:31.30]Friday, August 19th at 4.30 Pacific.
[266:35.03]Go, go, go, go.
[266:37.75]Good night, guys.
[267:00.64]Make sure to call your mother.
