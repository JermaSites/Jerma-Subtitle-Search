[02:36.24]You want me to do it?
[02:39.10]Well, it says whoever has the best computer should host it, and that's definitely not you.
[02:45.25]How do you know?

[03:15.38]Although whenever I do a heavy computer game, I smell ozone in my room.
[03:21.92]So I don't know if that... I probably shouldn't host the game.
[03:25.57]Okay.
[03:25.87]Star, you got a good one?
[03:27.25]You're in the middle of all of us, I think.
[03:30.57]I forget if mine's a 3090 or a 40.

[04:04.97]Down to the numbers.

[04:12.92]Of pure gaming.
[04:17.80]Yeah.
[04:19.68]Well, I think you're going to like this game.
[04:22.52]Okay.
[04:25.51]Yeah, it's going to be just to change topics.
[04:27.19]It's going to be great.
[04:27.91]I think you're going to have a nice time.
[04:30.09]Oh, man.
[04:30.63]I'm going to host.
[04:32.05]No.
[04:33.13]You're not allowed.
[04:34.49]It's the best computer to internet ratio and you're on the East Coast.
[04:38.24]Oh, you guys hear me now?
[04:39.04]I can hear you.
[04:40.60]Hi, Poke.
[04:41.46]Oh my God.

[05:07.74]Yeah.
[05:09.54]Yeah, you have to host, dude.
[05:12.62]Okay.
[05:13.98]This game was gatekeeping all of us.
[05:18.63]So this is proximity voice.
[05:20.23]So imagine when we get in the game, we're just going to be in Discord.
[05:22.91]Yeah.
[05:24.89]So I can give you guys some pointers.
[05:27.18]I'm not going to spoil too much.
[05:28.70]I played it for a couple hours.
[05:30.42]It's very good.
[05:31.30]I liked it a lot.
[05:32.92]And yeah, here's my one tip.
[05:36.94]Be sure to type in the game a little bit.
[05:39.14]Type a message when you get in the game.
[05:40.43]I think you'll enjoy that.
[05:43.70]So do we join a game off of... Oh, sorry.
[05:48.00]I was being a settings guy.
[05:49.00]I had to turn off motion blur.
[05:50.88]I'm not even friends with you on Steam.
[05:53.78]I think it has a coach for the room.
[05:59.30]Here, I'll give you my friend code.
[06:01.66]I could host then.
[06:03.00]Because I'm actually friends with all of you.
[06:06.98]Well, if you want to add me, I'm there.
[06:11.78]I'll consider it.
[06:12.32]Alright.
[06:18.36]You know, I was at the mall.
[06:19.52]I walked by.
[06:20.16]I went to Spencer's.
[06:22.24]I saw some lava lamps, and I was like, Oh, really?
[06:27.67]These are nothing.
[06:28.67]Yeah, like, wait till they see ours.
[06:31.55]That's what I kept saying.
[06:32.55]You felt nothing.
[06:34.06]What was the quality?
[06:35.48]I was just saying, ugh, garbage.
[06:36.88]Wait until they see our lava lamps.
[06:38.22]I was going to say, what was the make and model?
[06:41.22]Was it steel?
[06:42.16]Aluminum?
[06:43.10]Glass?
[06:43.42]Just basic.
[06:44.78]Just basic ass plastic base.
[06:46.78]Basic shit.
[06:47.40]That's not us.
[06:48.38]Yeah.
[06:49.62]Yeah.
[06:50.28]I can hear you in game twice.
[06:53.12]I didn't even host.
[06:55.90]I'll stop talking.
[06:56.40]No, I hosted.
[06:57.20]I'm inviting.
[06:58.02]I invited everybody.
[06:59.07]Wait, I could have hosted.
[07:00.84]You didn't invite me.
[07:01.82]Hang on.
[07:02.81]I did, but you're offline on Steam.
[07:04.17]I know.

[07:27.02]You're usually Jerry, aren't you?
[07:29.20]Yeah, it's me that's usually Jerry.
[07:33.59]How do you change your character?
[07:34.61]Wait, how do you do that?
[07:38.47]Oh, you just change color.
[07:40.25]You can be like a little fella.
[07:42.27]There you go.
[07:43.13]There you go.
[07:46.67]Wait, I kind of like this.
[07:47.67]I feel more like myself when it talks like that.
[07:51.74]You're in natural state.
[07:53.47]Yeah.
[07:56.67]Which one's green?
[07:59.13]I mean, I'm typically green in games, but I don't mind switching it up.
[08:03.05]Your call, Po.
[08:05.43]Yeah, but there could be, like, light green and then dark green.
[08:08.51]Yeah, so we can split the difference.
[08:10.80]Which one do you like?
[08:13.70]Uh...
[08:16.29]nah you have royalty so I'll let you take it first which one do you want I don't I don't mind being this guy like I like this this is like a like a vomity kind of green okay I'll find one alright sir can you talk in the game Ster are you here sir sir sir that's kind of scary is this the color you guys want I had I had pushed the talk and I forgot just make sure everybody sounds good
[08:46.38]Jerma, is this the color you want?
[08:48.80]I was gonna be like teal or light blue, yeah.
[08:52.62]And Ster?
[08:54.64]I'm very happy.
[08:56.36]With my color.
[08:57.18]I can be yellow.
[09:00.75]That seems like a good... good color variety.
[09:04.89]Do it.
[09:07.67]Oh, I have to show the game.
[09:08.55]Oops.
[09:11.17]Have you done this before?
[09:13.62]This is Jerma's first stream.
[09:15.54]I... I'm... Yeah.
[09:18.04]It's the first of many.
[09:19.54]I'll give you some tips.
[09:21.75]Alright, so what's the TL;DR of this game?
[09:26.91]I don't know.
[09:27.39]What do we do?
[09:29.69]That's like Vampire Survivors.
[09:31.91]No.
[09:32.93]No.
[09:33.43]It's... Yeah, a little bit.
[09:37.70]So there's a quota.
[09:39.14]You're meeting a quota, and you're bringing objects...
[09:42.53]via a gravity gun to a spot don't damage the objects like if you hit them against the wall they lose money okay so that's that's kind of it I mean you'll pick up the rest as we go um it's actually very good and I can give you guys like little control advice as we go so okay so just don't bump stuff into the walls and bring stuff yeah deposit it and make money
[10:08.88]yeah and then when you make money you can buy stuff and and it's it's uh very addictive oh it's like Lethal Company in gmod okay cool yeah kind of we're the other way around are we ready I'm ready okay you crashed
[10:37.80]Next, get the horseman to play Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
[10:40.50]Oh shit, Ster, do you hear my chair?
[10:42.87]Yeah, it's kind of squeaky.
[10:44.41]I did a chair move earlier.
[10:46.49]Everybody has a really funny way that their mouth moves when they talk.
[10:49.71]That's right.
[10:50.45]Hello, buddy.
[10:51.19]I'm not your guy, buddy.
[10:53.35]Oh, so here, press N. Wait, what button is the title?
[10:57.58]Oh, T?
[10:58.40]Hello, you wrote.
[11:01.56]Hello.
[11:04.26]Hello, guys.
[11:10.15]Well, why do we even have voices?
[11:11.57]Why do we even talk?
[11:13.55]Check this out.
[11:14.59]If you go small, press Q, and then type.
[11:18.74]Yeah.
[11:39.53]So your left click... Left click is your, um... So here, grab me.
[11:49.14]Use the scroll wheel to move forward and back.
[11:52.28]Oh, it's one of these.
[11:54.00]Right click to rotate.
[11:58.02]Do I have to keep holding?
[11:59.32]You hold.
[11:59.76]Yeah, you hold.
[12:00.54]No, I don't know.
[12:01.84]I don't remember.
[12:02.48]Oh, yeah, you do.
[12:04.90]And then another thing you could do is this.
[12:06.24]If you run and jump, you could press Q in the air.
[12:09.88]And you do a cool thing.
[12:13.50]Cool.
[12:14.19]So why would you be... What's the point of being small?
[12:18.19]Hiding from things.
[12:19.61]What do you mean things?
[12:23.61]There may be things.
[12:26.71]Let's get some stuff.
[12:29.93]So we need 11,000, and I'll show you, Jerma.
[12:32.75]Take a look at this.
[12:33.67]Only Jerma, no one else.
[12:34.64]Oh, they're not here anyway.
[12:35.94]Alright, so you grab ball, and then you're going to put it in this collection area.
[12:40.22]Ball.
[12:41.74]We're already in it?
[12:45.10]Right here.
[12:46.08]Yeah.
[12:47.78]Right?
[12:48.20]So now that we already have 1,000, and there's this cart here that we can bring with us so we can make item collection a little easier.
[12:55.71]Good job, Ster.
[12:58.25]You figured it out.
[12:59.64]I'm trapped.
[13:00.68]I am trapped.
[13:02.76]Alright, have fun guys.
[13:04.20]Just don't break stuff.
[13:07.22]A little bit.
[13:09.89]Tripping out.
[13:10.95]It gets weird.
[13:12.55]Very, very scary already.
[13:14.25]I don't know that I can do this.
[13:16.59]So we can ride in the cart too, that's cool.
[13:18.33]If you want.
[13:20.94]I'm imagining a lot of things can be picked up, but not everything can be picked up, I imagine.
[13:26.00]Wait, what's going on?
[13:28.52]What happened?
[13:31.44]Oh, don't get close.
[13:33.74]Who's vomiting?
[13:35.16]Oh, you're... Oh.
[13:37.08]Shake him.
[13:37.92]He's pissing.
[14:01.28]Are we peeing onto you?
[14:05.52]Shit, alright, nevermind.
[14:08.22]I'll just go vomit elsewhere.
[14:10.30]So if you puke on us, is that bad?
[14:11.60]I think that's bad, yeah.
[14:16.34]Hey, can you please, can you say, can you say, uh, you got a freaking dart in your neck?
[14:22.78]And then say, you're crazy.
[14:23.60]It's over now.
[14:25.02]Oh, man.
[14:26.05]Sorry.
[14:26.29]What's going on, guys?
[14:29.81]You got a freakin' dart in your neck, man.
[14:34.53]Um, this... Oh, God, guys.
[14:36.63]This explosive barrel is worth 11,000.
[14:38.55]Holy shit.
[14:40.41]But it is highly... Let me handle this one.
[14:44.02]Oh, God, we need two people to handle this one.
[14:45.66]Oh, fuck.
[14:46.54]Oh, God.
[14:46.90]Yeah, you guys got that one.
[14:49.04]Don't bump it.
[14:49.48]Be super, super careful.
[14:51.52]Okay?
[14:51.78]Don't bump it.
[14:52.46]You looked like you were gonna bump it.
[14:54.56]Don't bump it.
[14:56.52]You're close to the wall, guys.
[14:59.10]Please don't scratch my walls, guys.
[15:00.52]Come on.
[15:01.60]This will... Don't... Poke... Don't get too close to... Oh.
[15:04.63]Good job, buddy.
[15:07.67]I can't see behind me.
[15:09.53]I have to be guided.
[15:10.21]I don't know where we're going.
[15:10.99]Are we walking forward?
[15:12.33]You might want to strafe left a little bit.
[15:16.22]More.
[15:16.66]Good.
[15:17.16]Back.
[15:20.58]This is very tough.
[15:22.18]Okay, so we're going to go...
[15:27.17]All the dust in here.
[15:28.29]Look at your keyboard and press Q. Hang on, I'm gonna drop this for a second, okay?
[15:32.26]I'm very quiet.
[15:33.00]Okay.
[15:33.80]Um, I wanna get this door out of the way, so we can make this easier.
[15:40.26]Lift it up here, maybe.
[15:41.76]Keyboard.
[15:43.38]Back here.
[15:43.78]Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is good.
[15:44.89]Right here.
[15:47.23]I am Deeth.
[15:49.99]Deeth.
[15:51.69]It's a funny name.
[15:53.90]How do you, uh, somebody... Write a, write a line from Papers, please.
[16:00.00]I've never played it.
[16:03.11]Whatever, what do they say?
[16:03.91]They go... Why not bring the cart to the barrel?
[16:08.81]That's a probably a good idea.
[16:12.32]I'll bring the bear.
[16:13.09]I'll bring the car.
[16:13.69]Oh, you got it.
[16:14.45]Oh, I'm dead.
[16:15.45]Sorry.
[16:17.29]Am I dead?
[16:17.77]No, you're good.
[16:19.65]Just press Q. Alright.
[16:22.68]Let's do it very, very carefully.
[16:28.02]Let's fucking just, let's smush it in there.
[16:36.60]What if the cart moves?
[16:38.45]Okay.
[16:38.91]Cart can move, I think, and it should be alright.
[16:41.39]I'll handle this.
[16:42.05]If I die, it'll be my fault.
[16:54.80]You look like you're at school.
[17:01.88]You're coming with me.
[17:04.79]You're coming with me, buster.
[17:06.93]Alright, I need a little help here.
[17:09.89]So I'm gonna grab this part, you grab this part.
[17:13.91]Oh wait, can we just drag the cart onto it?
[17:17.36]Let's see.
[17:21.10]Move the door out of the way.
[17:23.56]We're good.
[17:23.88]Oh my god, we just won.
[17:24.70]We got everything we need.
[17:25.92]Yeah, we won, and we got a bunch of extra money.
[17:27.59]Holy shit.
[17:28.39]I got poke.
[17:30.79]Alright, good.
[17:36.22]Wow, I did it.
[17:36.86]Wait, we did it?
[17:37.96]You did it.
[17:39.84]It's that easy.
[17:47.13]Okay, so now we have a bunch of extra money.
[17:49.73]And that's good.
[17:50.23]Can we get the Gatling done?
[17:54.41]I love the eyes.
[17:56.45]I'm... I'm confused.
[18:05.55]Oh, Tab gets a nice map, apparently?
[18:08.19]Yep.
[18:10.37]Oh, it does.
[18:11.95]Guys, I just drank a Red Bull.
[18:13.07]If I'm weird, just let me know.
[18:14.21]Okay?
[18:15.27]Let's get fucking weird, dude.
[18:17.03]Yeah, let's get fucking weird.
[18:18.88]Bro, let's get fucked up.
[18:21.68]Come on.
[18:23.10]What?
[18:24.96]Like, on what?
[18:27.92]These are upgrades for your character.
[18:31.10]These are great.
[18:32.50]You can buy anything.
[18:35.54]We have that 16k.
[18:36.97]That is not needed for the next round.
[18:38.97]That is purely for buying stuff.
[18:41.97]What does energy crystals do?
[18:44.77]I think it refills something.
[18:49.30]That's not helpful, I know.
[18:53.86]Um...
[18:56.27]Oh, what's happening?
[18:57.89]That seems like a bad idea.
[18:59.27]How do you even buy things?
[19:01.66]Wait, did you just throw a grenade in the corner?
[19:04.14]I tried to pick it up and I activated it.
[19:06.54]So you can buy stuff like this here.
[19:09.40]I'm gonna buy something.
[19:10.68]I'm gonna buy something really cheap.
[19:14.05]I'm gonna get the stamina upgrade for 2k.
[19:17.99]And I'll...
[19:23.38]Is that mine?
[19:24.38]Why is it on the ground?

[22:34.64]Oh, come on, guys.
[22:37.88]Why are you putting this thing so big?
[22:40.27]Why are you bringing it in here?
[22:41.11]Well, because I'm trying to help.
[22:46.47]You could just put the things in here.
[22:48.15]Come on.
[22:49.15]I'm the kid at the grocery store.
[22:51.31]I'm the kid at the grocery store in the front of the cart.
[22:55.34]Our child's poke.
[22:57.14]Hey, hey.
[23:02.46]I want the slime toy.
[23:04.18]How about this?
[23:04.82]You can't have the slime toy.
[23:06.12]You have a slime toy at home.
[23:08.31]You can pick out any cereal on the island.
[23:10.13]How's that Captain Crush looking?
[23:11.33]How about, how about Count Chocula?
[23:14.45]Let's go.
[23:14.85]What?
[23:14.97]How does Count Skibbity sound?
[23:16.39]What was that?
[23:16.87]What?
[23:17.15]Are you alright?
[23:19.47]What?
[23:19.92]Ow!
[23:32.73]It's really cumbersome.
[23:33.75]This is a really annoying object.
[23:36.57]Sorry.
[23:36.91]Sorry about that.
[23:39.92]How do I stand up?
[23:40.62]Okay.
[23:42.92]Alright.
[23:43.96]Give it a crunch.
[23:47.44]I think I'm with a stack potential.
[23:49.56]I love a good physics stack.
[23:54.89]Oh, we got a chest.
[23:55.95]You got a key?
[23:59.93]What's in there?
[24:02.53]Yeah, you hold it.
[24:03.03]There's a diamond in here.
[24:05.81]Careful.
[24:06.07]We can't both be grabbed.
[24:07.13]We can't.
[24:07.67]No, no.
[24:08.67]Yes, we can.
[24:09.45]Oh, I need it.
[24:12.12]We can both hold it.
[24:14.40]Let me hold it for a little longer, though.
[24:16.02]Okay.
[24:18.96]Alright.
[24:19.24]Okay.
[24:22.00]I got this vase.
[24:26.01]Does this say $9 or is that $9,000?
[24:30.75]Why is there a .177?
[24:31.99]Are we trading in fractions of Bitcoin?
[24:35.07]It actually does look like $9.
[24:35.77]We have $9,000.
[24:36.03]We're doing very well.
[24:41.81]Is there a push on the other side?
[24:43.32]I'm walking backwards through here.
[24:44.78]Where are you going?
[24:45.58]Where are you running?
[24:47.70]I was looking for loot.
[24:49.22]Oh, that was very, that was very, that was like menacing.
[24:51.96]Dude, this whole time my headphones were on backwards or something and I was freaking out thinking I was the problem.
[24:56.70]Well, let's, let's test, right?
[24:57.86]So if I stand here, do I come out?
[24:59.76]Am I in your left ear right now?
[25:02.95]Yeah, you know, it's right now, it's correct now, but my headphones are, I had to flip them manually.
[25:08.15]So I don't know.
[25:09.13]I don't even want to talk about it, but I'm bringing it up.
[25:11.61]By the way, have you also noticed that like on the headphones, that shit says L and R on it and it's engraved?
[25:17.59]Yes.
[25:18.47]You can't even read it.
[25:19.35]You have to put it under a fucking microscope.
[25:21.19]What's up with that?
[25:24.99]We should make our own headphones.
[25:26.93]Yeah, we'll make four different headphones.
[25:33.88]And they'll be very in quality too.
[25:36.20]Can we open this?
[25:39.50]Uh... I think Vinny did.
[25:42.30]Oh, I heard he got it.
[25:44.86]Yeah.
[25:45.10]Alright, we gotta... There's not a lot of blood over there.
[25:49.32]They're probably waiting for us.
[25:53.40]Oh shit!
[25:54.33]What was that?
[25:55.07]What was what?
[25:56.55]It's a shadow.
[25:59.83]What, what, what, what, what?
[26:00.89]Oh my god!
[26:02.45]Oh my god!
[26:03.17]What the?
[26:06.05]Oh shit!
[26:06.75]Oh shit!
[26:07.21]Dude, I think I just turned my computer off.
[26:09.30]I think I turned off my computer.
[26:10.68]Hold on, I actually think I turned my computer off.
[26:12.64]I hit the Windows button and then went to, like, shutdown.
[26:14.40]Shit!
[26:14.54]Fuck!
[26:14.76]You didn't tell me?
[26:33.00]I actually hit the Windows key.
[26:36.64]Oh my god.
[26:39.44]I forgot to tell you guys how to revive.
[26:41.98]It'll never know we're here.
[26:45.30]We're never gonna get revived, Jerm.
[26:46.70]Alright, so I pressed 1 to throw a grenade at that guy, but all it did was take it out, and I was just holding it.
[26:52.57]So then I pressed E to throw, I guess I threw it, but it didn't go very far, and it just dropped in front of me.
[26:57.61]Hey, shut up about your favorite type of anime!
[27:01.19]Yeah.
[27:03.05]Oh man.
[27:03.55]They're dead!
[27:05.03]They're dead.
[27:05.51]We gotta get the cart.
[27:08.09]We need the money.
[27:09.71]So- so they have to- Hey, this is- this is venue, right?
[27:13.19]I'm colorblind.
[27:13.91]What color was this?
[27:15.87]They have to get us.
[27:17.25]Uh, I'm gonna- I'm gonna message in the group.
[27:20.25]Oh, he's like DM'd.
[27:21.25]Oh no, they got me!
[27:22.49]They got me.
[27:23.45]There's a baby.
[27:24.29]I hear a baby.
[27:26.19]Okay, so yeah, all they have to do is bring it to the-
[27:30.15]Hold on.
[27:30.95]Put this in the cart.
[27:31.81]I think he saw something.
[27:32.69]I don't know.
[27:33.57]You're good.
[27:35.85]Weird.
[27:36.13]They got a pop-up on how to revive.
[27:40.17]That's good.
[27:41.23]Alright.
[27:44.31]Alright.
[27:45.67]I may eat pineapple in a little bit.
[27:47.24]Alright.
[27:48.04]Ooh.
[27:49.08]Really?
[27:49.36]Just want to let you know.
[27:50.44]Yeah.
[27:50.58]That sounds awesome.
[27:52.98]Yeah.
[27:55.12]Where are you?
[27:55.90]Do you eat it until your mouth hurts or do you only eat like two pieces?
[27:58.40]Oh.
[27:59.96]Oh my god.
[28:05.54]That's a great, like, yell.
[28:08.24]He does have a good yell.
[28:11.06]After the dentist today, I don't think I can eat it until my mouth hurts, because it already hurts.
[28:16.39]So I'm gonna just have a little bit.
[28:19.07]I need you to guide me on the map when I'm pushing.
[28:22.25]I thought you meant like, do I eat it like raw?
[28:27.89]Like without, you know like the spikes, and then my mouth would hurt?
[28:32.76]Yeah, like I eat the spikes.
[28:34.16]You should look the other way, you should like... What is that called, a shell?
[28:38.76]Does a pineapple have a shell?
[28:41.58]I think it is a shell.
[28:45.80]Boneless pineapple.
[28:48.92]Take a left!
[28:50.38]Okay, hold on.
[28:51.12]Watch the gear.
[28:51.92]Okay.
[28:52.52]Okay.
[28:53.40]The gear's good.
[28:54.10]Gear's good.
[28:54.56]Take a right.
[28:55.24]Take a right right here.
[28:56.50]Now we're going to take a left right here.
[29:02.57]They got this.
[29:03.19]They're doing good.
[29:04.57]I think that should be fine.
[29:06.19]It's right there, right?
[29:06.87]Oh, yeah.
[29:07.83]Yeah.
[29:09.01]Right here.
[29:09.45]You can really run with it.
[29:10.51]It's an exoskeleton.
[29:14.09]And here we are.
[29:14.79]We're coming back.
[29:16.03]Really?
[29:17.11]Oh, that's awesome.
[29:21.20]With one health.
[29:21.84]Are we dead?
[29:22.58]They fucked up.
[29:24.64]Oh.
[29:25.62]No, we're... We're just... Hey.
[29:31.03]Hi, guys.
[29:32.49]Hey!
[29:33.59]So... We have one health each.
[29:37.63]Oh.
[29:38.69]Thank you.
[29:39.23]Now I have 20.
[29:40.11]All I need is 20.
[29:40.97]That's fine.
[29:41.35]If you want to give Jerma a little bit of your health, click the back of his neck.
[29:44.48]What is this right here?
[29:45.46]Well, Poke has to give it.
[29:46.92]I already gave health.
[29:47.78]I already vamped.
[29:48.58]Why are you dropping the cash?
[29:50.16]How do I get money again?
[29:51.10]We need that because we're going to go to extraction point number two now.
[29:54.16]How do I get that money?
[29:55.84]Click the back of his neck.
[30:00.20]Ooh.
[30:01.04]Alright.
[30:02.54]That's alright.
[30:03.06]30 health.
[30:03.78]That was very altruistic of you, Poke, because now you're like almost dead.
[30:06.39]Oh, wait.
[30:06.67]I need to give some of that back.
[30:08.53]Here, let me give some back.
[30:09.65]Oh, thank you.
[30:12.31]I have 28 now.
[30:13.69]How much you got?
[30:14.65]21.
[30:14.71]Alright, cool.
[30:16.89]I think that's good.
[30:24.23]Wait, did you get hurt though?
[30:25.29]That almost killed me.
[30:28.24]Go over there.
[30:29.58]Where's Vinny?
[30:32.24]Can you throw things?
[30:34.38]Try to catch.
[30:34.92]Here's something weird.
[30:41.70]Watch this.
[30:42.56]Watch this.
[30:42.88]Watch this.
[30:43.88]Maybe.
[30:46.25]Are you scuttling?
[30:48.21]No, there's people behind us.
[30:49.61]Watch this.
[30:50.21]What are you going to do?
[30:51.25]I'm going to get stamina.
[30:54.59]What was that?
[30:55.59]I don't know.
[30:56.56]You just hit me in the face with your flashlight.
[30:58.88]No, I don't know what that was.
[30:59.78]You guys couldn't?
[31:01.78]Yeah.
[31:02.00]Okay, guys, come here.
[31:06.04]I'm all behind you!
[31:07.06]Oh, shit!
[31:08.06]The head is back!
[31:10.10]The head!
[31:15.30]Save yourself.
[31:17.38]No.
[31:18.20]I want to be with you.
[31:18.84]How are you supposed to fight that thing?
[31:20.26]I don't know.
[31:21.04]Thanks, man.
[31:22.16]That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said.
[31:26.76]Wait, I didn't think there was monsters in this game.
[31:29.29]Yeah, I didn't really know what we were getting into, but now I kind of understand what we were getting into.
[31:33.43]I understand everything now.
[31:34.59]Yeah, I get it now.
[31:35.69]Did I tell you my audio is weird?
[31:39.29]Dude, hey.
[31:40.49]You know what's fucked up?
[31:43.86]What's going on with that engraving?
[31:45.82]Left and right.
[31:47.22]Shit's so fucking annoying.
[31:48.32]You don't know.
[31:48.98]You gotta get it under a microscope.
[31:50.82]It feels like... It feels like you have to really... You put it in and sometimes... When you push it in too far, you can't hear anything.
[32:00.26]And it blocks all your hearing.
[32:03.42]Wait, so how do you stop the head guy?
[32:05.58]Oh, God.
[32:16.63]Well, tutorial is now over.
[32:20.29]Yeah, I think we did.
[32:30.14]Yeah, quite nice.
[32:31.78]What?
[32:31.98]Quite nice.
[32:33.76]What's this?

[32:40.27]Beat the shit out of each other.
[32:43.96]What the fuck was that?
[32:45.00]Why did I just go flying?
[32:47.46]What?
[32:48.98]Why did I just go flying off the atmosphere?
[32:51.22]I didn't do it.
[32:52.96]Nobody even attacked me.
[32:53.84]That was a good dodge.
[33:00.76]Damn.
[33:05.48]It's like that time in the holodeck when, um, Barclay created a bunch of, uh, fake members of the Enterprise, and then he, like, they were like musketeers and they fought with, um, swords.
[33:18.02]And then he kissed Counselor Troi.
[33:21.07]Die!
[33:21.51]Oh no!
[33:26.11]Holy shit, he's dead.
[33:28.03]How am I supposed to kill you with this?
[33:29.53]I don't, like...

[37:02.75]Where do you want to leave now?
[37:05.29]Oh my god, he's got an obliteration ray!
[37:08.41]What?
[37:09.49]I don't know how to leave!
[37:10.54]I don't know how to leave!
[37:16.02]Well, we should just restart.
[37:28.33]Where did those things even come from?
[37:31.10]Oh no.
[37:33.60]I forgot to teach them how to leave.
[37:36.74]That's an important one.
[37:39.90]Well then again, I can't help but leave too for a second.
[37:41.82]Alright.
[37:45.49]Oh, no.
[37:46.69]Hey guys, ready?
[37:47.29]I'm going to be typing into the game.
[37:48.59]Oh, shit.
[37:52.17]Hey, somebody help me lift this up.
[38:02.21]Team, team, team, team.
[38:03.47]Somebody pick this up.
[38:05.63]Pick up the other side.
[38:06.17]We can smash this into somebody's head.
[38:09.28]Alright, ready?
[38:10.12]You get one side.
[38:10.58]Alright, Vinny, let's hook him up with that.
[38:11.78]Vinny, Vinny.
[38:12.34]Alright.
[38:13.48]We're going to have to kill him.
[38:16.52]Sprint.
[38:17.56]Battering ram, charge.
[38:22.30]Didn't work.
[38:23.58]Okay.
[38:25.08]Just shut them up, Vinny.
[38:26.08]Just... Help.
[38:34.18]Ow.
[38:34.38]Dammit, this tranquilizer gun didn't work.
[38:42.61]Ow!
[38:42.89]Did you just hit yourself in the head with a frying pan?
[38:48.07]Ow!
[38:50.48]What the fuck?
[38:57.68]I am the master of the crystal and I will win!
[38:59.84]I just won.
[39:05.98]Yeah, everyone's a loser again.
[39:08.82]Yeah.
[39:09.24]Guys, let's try and beat level two.
[39:12.82]We can beat level two.
[39:14.38]We can beat... Can you hear me?
[39:25.97]Okay, so that was fun.
[39:32.59]Alright, when you want to leave up here,
[39:35.95]You do that.
[39:37.85]Okay.
[39:38.75]But yeah, not until we have all the money.
[39:40.69]They're not paying attention to the rules.
[39:43.03]No, yeah, that's the only screen I remember.
[39:45.73]Okay, these green plates are very, very fragile.
[39:51.05]You are just ramming this into every room, Ster.
[39:55.45]Ster, you just broke $2,900.
[39:56.41]And that's coming off of your screen, by the way, not ours.
[40:01.93]Oh, no.
[40:04.32]I'm in the red.
[40:10.30]Watch out for ghouls.
[40:13.43]You're a ghoul.
[40:14.03]Just move.
[40:15.29]You're a what?
[40:16.29]Wow.
[40:16.93]Wow.
[40:17.81]Wow.
[40:18.21]You two are gonna have to do this.
[40:20.89]Oh, okay.
[40:21.59]Really?
[40:23.07]Oh, my God.
[40:24.59]What?
[40:26.71]What is that?
[40:28.19]Oh, shit!
[40:29.47]What is it?
[40:29.86]What is it?
[40:30.16]What is it?
[40:30.46]Why am I facing the other direction?
[40:32.16]Close the door.
[40:32.76]Close the door.
[40:33.18]Door, door, door.
[40:34.50]Got it.
[40:34.70]Oh, my God.
[40:35.76]It opened again.
[40:36.42]We sprung it too far.
[40:37.52]Wait, it's just a little duck.
[40:38.44]Oh, he's there.
[40:38.94]He's there.
[40:40.93]Oh my god, he turned into a fucking monster!
[40:43.13]There's a guy with a broom?
[40:45.37]This guy has a gun!
[40:47.23]In the box!
[40:51.61]Hello?
[40:52.74]That box, that's a good hiding spot.
[40:54.30]Yo, yo, it's bad in there.
[40:57.22]It's bad in there.
[41:00.38]Oh no!
[41:04.54]I'm in this box!
[41:05.20]Do not pick up the duck.
[41:06.28]Do not pick up the duck.
[41:07.52]Why is it like Farmer Joe or something walking around with a shotgun?
[41:11.07]I opened the door and he point blank shot me in the face.
[41:14.96]He was just standing there ready.
[41:16.70]He was camping.
[41:17.46]I thought it was a broom.
[41:19.96]I thought he was like a cleaner or janitor or something.
[41:25.10]Don't pick it up.
[41:26.30]Or like the guy that curates the museum or something.
[41:28.80]Alright, this duck will do everything it can to get you to pick it up.
[41:37.15]I hope we beat level 1.
[41:40.73]Hold control and you can crouch under the bed.
[41:43.65]Oh, Pokes said it was a gun?
[41:44.77]Oh.
[41:46.61]There was a lot going on there.
[41:47.78]There was a lot of screaming.
[41:48.90]There was a lot of panic going on.
[41:50.52]Got one of them right there.
[41:51.30]Alright.
[41:54.22]This thing makes you spin.
[41:56.90]Oh, my bad.
[41:57.52]No, that's all good.
[41:59.02]That was under the bed.
[42:05.89]What happened to the shotgun guy?
[42:08.61]Um, he's gotta be here somewhere.
[42:10.83]Yeah, where is he?
[42:11.89]Fuck, I found him!
[42:15.48]And the duck, too.
[42:16.08]Is he right there?
[42:17.02]He's behind this door.
[42:18.18]I don't think they see the duck.
[42:21.84]Well, he was saying if you pick up the duck, it hurts you, so don't pick it up.
[42:24.94]I think it's just annoying.
[42:26.90]Now we run.
[42:33.71]Do we have enough money?
[42:34.35]Nope.
[42:37.83]There's other rooms we can investigate that aren't there.
[42:41.51]I'm behind him.
[42:42.05]Don't worry.
[42:48.49]Get out of my cart.
[42:50.05]Oh, it's in the cart with him.
[42:51.66]Yeah.
[42:53.54]No.
[42:56.12]He wants to be picked up so bad.
[42:57.68]That's funny.
[42:58.54]You may not.
[43:00.10]I wonder if you can do anything with it though.
[43:01.98]Is it something that's just kind of in the way?
[43:08.31]oh shit fuck oh good hiding spot I really like how you can hide in this it seems to work pretty well too
[43:39.11]Oh, fuck!
[43:46.16]Oh, fuck!
[43:48.86]Where's the cart?
[43:53.02]Just take it to the place.
[43:57.52]He's got his phone.
[44:02.07]This is a -2 kind of game, but it's 235.
[44:19.91]Yeah, I want to definitely see the next few levels for sure.
[44:22.36]There's nothing valuable here?
[44:25.58]Really?
[44:26.58]Nothing?
[44:34.58]I didn't expect the guy with the shotgun, like, we had just started.
[44:38.18]Yeah, he was just literally 100 feet down the hallway.
[44:44.14]My favorite remit.
[44:50.59]Oh, I gotta try something.
[44:52.21]I gotta try something.
[44:52.83]I'm gonna annoy the fuck out of the entire lobby.
[44:54.37]It's gonna be awful.
[44:54.77]I don't know if there's enough stuff on this level to make us win.
[45:00.21]I think we damaged it.
[45:02.19]Yeah.
[45:02.43]Let's see if it works.
[45:10.02]Wait, I found some covers.
[45:13.65]The classic text-to-speech.
[45:16.91]Oh, quick.
[45:31.97]I have to do this in front of everybody to annoy as many people as possible.
[45:35.22]I didn't say the B, why?
[46:06.77]What about this duck?
[46:08.05]Do not touch the duck.
[46:10.67]One click will kill you?
[46:11.57]Like a small click?
[46:13.63]Yes.
[46:16.63]Like 100% kill you.
[46:21.60]Alright.
[46:23.28]Hey!
[46:24.90]Hey!
[46:26.64]Guys!
[46:27.96]Oh my god!
[46:28.38]Oh my god!
[46:29.32]What do I do?
[46:29.88]What do I do?
[46:30.30]What do I do?
[46:30.66]What do I do?
[46:32.94]What do I do?
[46:33.92]Don't click the duck!
[46:36.28]Do we need to bring him into the truck?
[46:38.08]I'm bringing him.
[46:40.02]Got him.
[46:44.66]I got him in the duck.
[46:49.81]That might have been my fault.
[46:54.93]We didn't bring the duck with us, right?
[46:56.97]No.
[46:57.49]We need health.
[46:58.23]We need health.
[46:58.71]Can we get health?
[46:59.69]Can we get some health?
[47:00.97]Yeah, we can't afford most of it.
[47:03.39]Can we please get some health?
[47:23.80]It's $10,000 for a health pack?
[47:26.52]There's a little bit of health I got.
[47:28.12]I can share that.
[47:29.65]How about this?
[47:31.75]We get this one, and we get the other one, and that's 75 health.
[47:37.61]Can you throw things any other way than whipping your camera around?
[47:42.45]Not that I'm aware of.
[47:45.01]Wait, who needs health?
[47:47.20]I need health.
[47:48.68]You can lead the duck onto the extraction point to kill it.
[47:52.84]Wait, it's not showing.
[47:55.89]I can't give you anything here.
[47:58.49]We gotta go into the truck first, and then we can share the health.
[48:01.78]Okay.
[48:05.26]Whoa, that was a good throw.
[48:06.14]We have zero dollars, we just leave.
[48:08.42]Yeah, it's time to leave.
[48:14.77]Saw that.
[48:20.07]Can you, like, do a flip?
[48:24.45]Like, what if I do this?
[48:31.08]Oh!
[48:32.84]What are these?
[48:34.25]So you bought these?
[48:35.69]Who eats these?
[48:37.57]Who's got the lowest health?
[48:38.35]I'm going to just split them.
[48:39.79]I'm going to share it.
[48:40.99]I'm going to give you some health.
[48:44.80]Here.
[48:45.78]Oh, okay, never mind.
[48:47.18]Ooh, nice.
[48:48.28]I was going to give you some of me.
[48:51.88]How much do you have, Ster?
[48:54.12]76 now, I used that.
[48:55.36]Alright, so wait.
[48:55.88]So, okay, if I give some to you, Poke, and then you give some to Ster, and then Ster gives some to Vinny.
[49:00.35]I'm full.
[49:01.77]Ster, please give help.
[49:04.41]Here, Ster, you walk forward.
[49:05.55]Well, Poke is full.
[49:06.47]Poke just said he's full.
[49:07.61]Poke, please.
[49:08.05]Yeah, who wants some?
[49:09.31]I'll take two.
[49:10.05]I mean, I could use some more.
[49:11.25]Juice some.
[49:11.77]Juice some.
[49:12.21]I got them.
[49:12.65]Thank you.
[49:12.93]Alright, now you give me some of yours.
[49:15.88]Let me give you some more.
[49:17.28]No, you give, yeah, give me some of yours, and I'll give some to him.
[49:23.97]He just wants people behind him.
[49:26.93]I'm dead.
[49:28.87]I'm good.
[49:29.25]You can keep that.
[49:30.95]You good?
[49:31.37]You topped off?
[49:32.11]I'm at 40.
[49:33.32]I'm at 56, so I'm good.
[49:39.04]We just lost the health we just gained.
[49:41.54]Did I just die?
[49:43.46]Well, there goes all my health.
[49:46.52]Oh man, that reminds me of a fucking hilarious story.
[49:48.78]Left square bracket, right square bracket, left... Hilarious!
[49:52.14]Hilarious!
[49:52.88]It's so funny.
[49:55.80]Shit bugged.
[49:56.30]Alright, nobody, uh... Nobody die?
[50:02.57]Is this a vault?
[50:03.51]Is this vault 13?
[50:06.03]Looks like it.
[50:08.97]I found a thing, a frog.
[50:11.01]These things suck.
[50:13.33]What?
[50:15.14]I love frogs, but not this one.
[50:16.40]This is a bad frog.
[50:17.00]There's no such thing.
[50:19.64]There's nothing here.
[50:23.43]I'll be the cart guy.
[50:24.29]Not a bad job.
[50:34.20]Oh my god, I just crushed you.
[50:36.86]I'm not gonna be the cart guy anymore.
[50:37.92]I'm putting it down.
[50:38.40]I think I hear someone.
[50:40.28]Hey, let me refill you.
[50:44.30]No, I'm good.
[50:45.00]I got plenty.
[50:45.81]OK, fine.
[50:47.43]There's no damage.
[50:56.17]Nothing up here.
[50:59.31]Something down here, I think.
[51:02.11]Drop it.
[51:04.29]What is down here?
[51:05.13]Big Voss.
[51:06.93]Big Vossy.
[51:08.59]Pocket watch.
[51:09.03]Something in here.
[51:18.18]It's like you dropped fucking like grandma's urn.
[51:21.88]Oh no.
[51:24.12]Her ashes.
[51:28.18]I already don't know where I am.
[51:32.45]The thing Antarctic base, there's a fetish flag on the wall.
[51:36.87]Oh, interesting.
[51:38.69]Where's the cart?
[51:42.39]There it is.
[51:53.68]You got something big.
[51:54.66]Close the door.
[51:55.48]Close the door.
[51:56.68]Close the door.
[51:58.28]No, no, not that one.
[51:59.18]Where's the cart?
[52:00.38]Oh, this way.
[52:00.82]Follow me.
[52:03.80]Hey, are you hot?
[52:05.58]Straight here.
[52:06.08]I'll blow you some air.
[52:08.79]Right over here.
[52:11.39]Can you help me lift this?
[52:13.37]Yep.
[52:15.03]Yeah.
[52:15.59]Very good.
[52:16.15]Gentle.
[52:20.31]Should we lay it down?
[52:21.64]Yeah, we should.
[52:22.88]Even if it's like diagonal.
[52:24.20]Okay.
[52:26.24]Sauron.
[52:26.78]Sauron.
[52:27.10]There's Sauron.
[52:27.74]Sauron.
[52:28.24]Sauron.
[52:28.54]Watch out for Sauron.
[52:29.74]What?
[52:30.58]No.
[52:31.10]Did it take my diamond?
[52:31.98]Where'd the diamond go?
[52:34.06]There's no Sauron.
[52:35.60]No, there is.
[52:36.34]I think Polk is screaming.
[52:42.40]That's weird.
[52:42.98]Whatever that is.
[52:43.47]I'm not even scared.
[52:45.09]It's fucking stupid.
[52:46.09]Who cares?
[52:47.13]I'm not even like, I mean, come on.
[52:49.05]It's like, oh, long neck or something.
[52:51.15]Oh, no.
[52:51.61]Close it.
[52:55.29]Open it.
[52:55.85]Close it.
[52:59.08]Did you pick up a turd?
[53:00.72]What is that?
[53:01.20]It's an ocarina.
[53:04.14]Oh.
[53:05.58]Bad.
[53:07.08]Oh, my God.
[53:12.34]What the hell?
[53:13.60]Be calm.
[53:14.16]Be calm about it.
[53:15.72]Uh, guys.
[53:16.72]The door fell off.
[53:17.71]Guys, I want to have a sense of urgency here.
[53:19.91]There's a big monster behind us that I want to freak out, but there's a big one.
[53:22.81]And Vinny died, I think.
[53:23.95]I'm going under the table.
[53:24.97]Yeah, I think he's probably hiding.
[53:31.48]I ain't scared of nothing.
[53:35.04]We made the money.
[53:35.72]Do we want extra, right?
[53:40.87]We gotta go get Vinny.
[53:42.41]He died over here.
[53:44.35]Oh.
[53:50.74]Wait, where did he die?
[53:53.54]Must clear all extraction points.
[53:56.94]What do you mean?
[53:57.76]Where's Vinny?
[53:59.36]Sorry, I forgot.
[54:00.04]Vinny died somewhere in here.
[54:02.30]Can we use that one again to revive Vinny?
[54:05.07]Or no?
[54:05.89]I don't know.
[54:06.25]I mean, he's the guy that would know this.
[54:09.10]There's no reviving Vinny now.
[54:10.68]Oh no, really?
[54:12.26]Okay, I'm sorry.
[54:13.46]This happened to my buddy Eric once.
[54:15.64]We gotta go forward.
[54:18.14]Eric is dead.
[54:18.82]You know, Pokey... Yeah?
[54:25.52]We have to do all of the other extractions before we can leave.
[54:28.02]Oh.
[54:29.62]We have to bring him to a point two.
[54:32.38]Wait, I bring him with us?
[54:34.03]Yeah.
[54:35.03]Okay.
[54:46.12]disrespecting his corpse.
[54:48.78]Goblin.
[54:50.82]Goblin in there.
[54:51.38]He's dead.
[54:51.64]He has no idea.
[54:52.43]Don't open that door, Goblin.
[54:54.65]Don't open that door, Goblin.
[54:56.61]Goblin?
[54:56.99]Alright.
[54:57.43]I got Vinny's head.
[55:03.55]You got one guide.
[55:04.33]You can revive him at the second one.
[55:07.92]I found a car, a base.
[55:10.06]Do I bring it here or should I go home?
[55:14.67]Um, maybe there is no home anymore.
[55:17.45]We have to find the next one.
[55:18.47]I think we have to find the next thing.
[55:21.51]Oh, that was a shattering sound.
[55:29.30]Uh, we got big stuff in here, but we need to find the other one.
[55:31.62]I hear something spooky behind this.
[55:34.78]Oh, I think I found it.
[55:38.38]Is that how we leave?
[55:39.38]Should we?
[55:39.84]We haven't been over here.
[55:48.49]This is a pretty messed up living room.
[55:51.37]I got a propane tank and I should probably be very careful with it.
[56:11.98]Where's our cart with all the money and stuff?
[56:15.28]Like even that, I'm being so careful.
[56:18.99]Wait, I think we have to go back and get the cart.
[56:21.73]We don't need it.
[56:24.51]Oh, look.
[56:27.67]Where's Vinny's head?
[56:28.91]It's on the ground.
[56:33.93]It's right here somewhere.
[56:34.71]Where is it?
[56:35.85]It's in.
[56:36.55]I got it, guys.
[56:37.31]Guys, am I even here?
[56:40.88]Is this real life?
[56:42.48]Yeah.
[56:43.33]man we would have made quota but I saw poke break this this vase over here there was more stuff in that room that was not me okay there's one more room here oh wait 600 600
[57:14.01]There's a way to scan?
[57:16.29]I think I pressed right click and it highlighted stuff that was in the room.
[57:20.81]If you hit tab, the gold is also on the mini-map.
[57:23.11]I think there's only this thing left.
[57:29.11]Loot will show up on the mini-map as gold, yeah.
[57:32.73]I want to turn around, but I kinda can't.
[57:37.58]That was like a child scream.
[57:39.10]Dude, I got trashed.
[57:42.60]I'm a grown-ass man, dude.
[57:43.54]That's just scary.
[57:48.40]We need exactly the amount of money that I broke.
[57:51.98]I have 600 going in.
[57:57.53]Oh, no.
[57:58.79]Is there anything else?
[58:02.51]Okay, down here.
[58:06.15]Oh, it changed my pitch.
[58:08.45]Yeah, your voice went like... Oh, ping pong.
[58:12.79]I felt insecure for a bit there.
[58:13.85]I get it now.
[58:14.65]Thank God.
[58:17.87]Here's the frog.
[58:25.16]Alright, this is 1,000?
[58:25.80]1,100?
[58:25.82]I'll deposit it.
[58:26.20]I think we've explored the whole area.
[58:30.92]So what do we do?
[58:38.69]Poor Vinny, he's probably just being, he's probably sitting there going like, oh, what are these clowns doing?
[58:42.72]How do you get more stamina?
[58:59.18]Yes, you do.
[58:59.78]Yes, you do.
[59:01.08]I got this.
[59:01.62]This is worth 70,000.
[59:03.03]70,000?
[59:03.89]Yeah, I just need to be careful.
[59:06.67]Are you serious?
[59:19.27]There's 1,000.
[59:20.74]We're close.
[59:21.56]We need a little bit.
[59:23.74]Why would you inflate the number so much?
[59:26.16]It could have said two.
[59:27.56]Poke.
[59:28.16]Poke has the last thing.
[59:30.87]Poke.
[59:31.45]Oh, you got the cart too.

[59:43.19]That's it?
[59:43.61]Wait, we don't have enough.
[59:46.27]What do we do?
[59:52.01]Is there no way to just make money?
[59:54.21]There's one thing on the ground.
[59:55.41]Yeah, I think this... Behind this door, there's something.
[59:58.28]Something here.
[59:58.80]Is there?

[68:28.06]Okay, well, you said let's play, and then you were gone for 12 hours.
[68:31.71]Oh, sorry.
[68:32.39]My family wanted to hang out and have Korean barbecue.
[68:37.03]Okay, well, you also said I could have Korean barbecue, so I'm double betrayed.
[68:40.97]It's because you didn't come with my family to Korean barbecue, you made the Monster Hunter community mad.
[68:45.32]Press Q.
[68:52.35]Wait, what's happening?
[68:56.73]What?
[68:56.95]Did you kill him?

[69:01.61]That was so magical.
[69:04.45]I'm sorry I didn't come back home last night.
[69:07.91]Oh, by the way, by the way, I'm sorry.
[69:10.77]You deserved it.
[69:11.69]You deserved it because I got something.
[69:13.33]I got a gripe between the two of you.
[69:15.91]Vinny, what is your Monster Hunter rank right now?
[69:19.89]5?
[69:20.59]Yeah, I'm 5 too.

[69:31.37]No, just keep talking.
[69:32.91]Okay.
[69:33.28]I'll put him in the pot.
[69:34.56]Put me in the pot.
[69:35.06]Put me in the pot.
[69:35.66]Just burn him off.
[69:36.26]Burn him off me.
[69:37.88]Burn it off me.
[69:38.78]What?
[69:39.00]What?
[69:39.56]No, just keep talking about monsters.

[69:42.20]I'm sorry.
[69:42.72]Beep!
[69:46.58]Jeremy, you just have to, you just have to survive it.
[69:48.86]You just gotta do it.
[69:49.58]It's a process.
[69:50.38]Are you okay?
[69:56.78]So John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, his name is my name too.
[70:03.43]Whenever we go out, the people always shout in their ghosts.
[70:06.85]Oh, I'm fine.
[70:08.37]Oh, we got a big Nazi.
[70:11.45]I'm not, I broke the last one.
[70:12.81]I'm not brave.
[70:15.02]Help me.
[70:15.44]I would... I can help.
[70:17.28]Let's do it.
[70:18.18]Was my voice fucked up for that?
[70:19.42]Or does that just sound... Oh, the whole time it was messed up.
[70:21.78]It was great, yeah.
[70:23.16]No, it was messed up for the first second, and then we heard you normally the whole time.
[70:30.76]Why am I holding this?
[70:31.62]You guys got it.
[70:32.28]I'm fine.
[70:32.62]I'm just being an idiot.
[70:33.88]So, so Monster Hunter Rank 5?
[70:36.00]You're upset that everyone's outleveled you, Jerma?
[70:38.40]I'm Rank 5, you're Rank 5.
[70:39.84]These two knuckleheads are Level 20!
[70:41.86]Yeah.
[70:44.49]yeah but it all happens so fast once you figure it out that's my Monster Hunter experience literally every game when you get to skip like five levels I went from like 9 to 15 in one monster kind of yeah oh really okay so everything I'm saying is completely unfounded I apologize you're you're very close to the end and it's fine it's not I don't have any big weapons or anything
[71:08.40]Jerma, we can just, we'll just, we'll get those monsters dead and we'll reach high rank.
[71:13.50]It'll be fun.
[71:14.10]We could join you.
[71:14.78]We're not even like that ahead.
[71:16.52]Nope.
[71:17.82]We're not even much stronger.
[71:19.43]Nope.
[71:20.47]Yeah, no.
[71:29.56]We'll find other HR5s.
[71:31.54]Hey, Vinny, you know what?
[71:32.88]We could just ram them right now.
[71:35.16]When they come through the door, we could just fucking ram both of them.
[71:37.14]Just get rid of them, you know what I mean?
[71:39.01]Yeah, yeah.
[71:40.43]I'm ready, Captain.
[71:41.11]Let's wait for them to get in this.

[71:55.28]It's like a golden pineapple.
[71:57.88]Mmm, delicious.
[71:59.50]I can taste it through the game.
[72:01.26]That's weird.
[72:06.22]They might be too far away.
[72:07.02]Yeah, they're too far away.
[72:08.44]25k.
[72:08.48]Oh, there's a lot of stuff in here.

[74:07.22]Just like the one I used to know.
[74:10.80]Don't look at me.
[74:12.70]Don't look at me.
[74:15.12]Don't look at me.
[74:20.19]And may all of your Christmas...
[74:28.77]That's all we need.
[74:40.02]We need just that.
[74:41.40]That's it.
[74:42.10]Let me get him off me.
[74:43.22]Hold on.
[74:43.92]Hey, who wants... Hey, soup's on!
[74:57.38]He's off me.
[74:59.40]Yep, he's gone.
[75:00.46]Is Poke dead?
[75:04.80]He won't be in a second.
[75:11.12]That's big money.
[75:13.18]Hey, there you are.
[75:18.15]I'll give you some health, Poke.
[75:21.39]I can only spare one.
[75:24.25]I can do one.
[75:27.91]Sir, can you do one?
[75:30.01]I can't afford it.
[75:30.63]What do you mean?
[75:31.45]Yeah, you can.
[75:31.89]You're hoarding health.
[75:34.35]I have like six HP.
[75:36.99]Yeah, Jerma gave him like 10 and he hit 30.
[75:40.29]I don't think that I have enough.
[75:42.01]You give him one.
[75:43.65]Give him one right now.
[75:45.27]He seems like he's in another room right now.
[75:47.83]He is.
[75:50.57]He's looking in the bathroom.
[75:53.00]What happened?
[75:56.38]This is an expensive thing over there.
[76:01.05]Why did you bring this up here?
[76:04.29]Get in the fucking acid, okay?
[76:09.71]It's the funny voice.
[76:10.85]Don't let it gurgle.
[76:24.43]He did it on me.
[76:29.46]Poke!
[76:32.73]Open up stuff.
[76:34.53]Poke, you wanna help me get this door out?
[76:40.97]Yes.
[76:42.43]So, like, the strength upgrades help you lift bigger stuff?
[76:45.27]Yeah.
[76:45.53]Yeah, actually... Dude, I'm gonna do a strength two-handed axe build.
[76:52.44]You could... You could.
[76:53.78]There's no axes, but you could do hammer.
[76:57.14]No, it's an axe.
[76:59.68]Alright.
[77:09.20]This isn't Monster Hunter, sir.
[77:12.78]Yeah, we're not at 20.
[77:14.90]I'm gonna blow air at you.
[77:16.68]What are you gonna do?
[77:19.86]Blow air?
[77:21.04]You're gonna... What are you... What does that mean?
[77:23.86]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[77:25.20]Okay, thank you.
[77:26.46]Now give me some of that health now.
[77:29.19]I came up with that joke by myself.
[77:31.39]Hey, what 80s movie do you think this guy's from, Stirr?
[77:35.29]Did he do the fan joke?
[77:38.45]He did the fan joke.
[77:39.25]Why did he steal it from you?
[77:42.43]Don't worry about it.
[77:44.01]Did you take that from him?
[77:46.27]You piece of shit?
[77:46.99]Did you steal that joke from him?
[77:49.79]He told me I could have it.
[77:50.47]He told me I could have it.
[77:51.89]Is that true?
[77:53.02]Oh, he left.
[77:53.42]He didn't care.
[78:01.73]Ow.
[78:03.01]I need your hoarding health.
[78:03.81]Get out of the way.
[78:05.47]Get out of the way.
[78:07.27]Alright, Stuart, might as well take all the health.
[78:08.93]Might as well give him everything.
[78:10.11]I'll give him all my health.
[78:13.54]Crazy item this way.
[78:14.46]This way.
[78:16.46]Hello?
[78:16.78]We need like four of us to get it.
[78:19.22]Got a frog.
[78:20.62]Ooh.
[78:22.82]Cool frog.
[78:23.26]This thing is worth 42,000.
[78:23.98]That's big.
[78:28.06]Can I ride it?
[78:28.74]Holy shit.
[78:29.36]I think we need, we need like all four of us.
[78:32.68]Okay, let's do this right.
[78:33.38]Should we just shimmy in?
[78:38.04]We need to, yeah.
[78:41.84]Where am I getting the pump?
[78:43.52]First rotation, good.
[78:44.52]Okay, okay.
[78:47.02]You guys are gonna go back?
[78:53.15]Alright, we're gonna rotate it so that it's safe to go down.
[78:55.00]We should come down with it, not... Guys!
[78:57.86]Guys!
[78:58.74]Careful!
[78:58.98]Okay, rotate it.
[79:01.20]Good?
[79:02.30]Oh no, that was not good.
[79:03.52]Just two thousand dollars gone.
[79:04.98]Alright, we got this.
[79:05.64]We got this.
[79:06.26]Why are we bringing this upside down?
[79:08.18]Why is it backwards?
[79:09.00]You could've just made it... It's fine.
[79:10.86]It's fine.
[79:11.42]We could just do it.
[79:13.08]We could just slide it!
[79:14.81]It's on a platform!
[79:17.15]No, no.
[79:18.41]Lower!
[79:18.89]Too late.
[79:19.35]It's too late.
[79:19.85]Lower!
[79:20.29]Go back up!
[79:20.83]Go back up!
[79:21.97]No, we're good.
[79:22.37]We're good.
[79:26.54]Okay, we can't see anything.
[79:27.98]Leave it here now.
[79:29.30]For now.
[79:30.38]And then we find the room and we bring it.
[79:32.14]Okay.
[79:34.52]Okay, perfect.
[79:36.58]We only lost like 5k.
[79:37.14]What was that?
[79:40.85]What was that?
[79:42.49]We got it.
[79:42.89]This is the extraction point.
[79:44.05]We can bring it.
[79:44.81]Oh, okay.
[79:45.75]Let's clear this stuff out of the way.
[79:49.33]You can't.
[79:49.67]Never mind.
[79:51.19]There's a secret room here.
[79:53.83]Where?
[79:54.29]What's in it?
[79:56.69]Well, I can't get in it.
[79:57.49]I need help.
[79:58.55]I need someone to put me in.
[79:59.57]Above the stairs here.
[80:06.47]If someone could put me in the room, there's a power blast in there.
[80:13.89]Really?
[80:14.13]Oh, he's throwing them up?
[80:14.86]Can you figure this one out?
[80:15.70]Look at me.
[80:16.94]Really?
[80:17.24]Wait, what happened?
[80:19.10]Where are you?
[80:20.04]I died.
[80:21.00]Embarrassed.
[80:21.86]Embarrassed himself.
[80:24.20]I died.
[80:26.12]You're fine.
[80:27.30]Oh, yeah.
[80:28.42]Alright.
[80:30.10]Here, let's do this.
[80:31.78]Let's get this.
[80:33.56]Why are you exploding?
[80:34.46]Bowling ball, bowling ball, bowling ball!
[80:36.10]Something crazy is happening.
[80:37.34]Whoa, dude.
[80:38.48]Whoa!
[80:38.88]Oh, shit!
[80:41.29]Oh.
[80:43.13]Guys?
[80:44.23]Holy shit.
[80:46.31]Guys?
[80:48.12]That was such a fake jump scare into a real jump scare.
[80:52.62]That was a horror game.
[80:54.52]Oh, look at the bowling balls.
[80:55.76]Oh, that was scary.
[80:56.50]Nope.
[80:56.84]The real thing is right next to you.
[80:59.30]The bowling ball was the red herring.
[81:01.07]And Ster did that.
[81:04.13]Fuck.
[81:08.17]He's hiding from the monster.
[81:09.75]I'm hiding on the cart.
[81:19.11]What is this?
[81:21.35]He's enthralled by this.
[81:22.78]Oh no.
[81:45.06]It's bad here.
[81:45.90]I don't know if they're going to do it.
[81:47.54]I don't even know if they can lift that thing.
[81:49.64]I don't think they can.
[81:50.40]Oh my god, he's dropping shit down the stairs and it's losing like half its value.
[81:56.76]Does he even know he's doing that?
[82:00.20]Oh.
[82:02.70]Don't come down here!
[82:07.14]Studio Ghibli!
[82:11.04]That's its name now, I guess.
[82:12.12]Just Studio Ghibli.
[82:13.10]Okay, he got it.
[82:20.38]I didn't that's I didn't know that's what he said.
[82:22.04]That's so stupid.
[82:23.52]That's great It's probably still worth a decent amount I don't know if they can lift it with two people maybe I
[82:42.98]They need it, because otherwise we're not going to be able to... I don't think we're getting the thing out of there, because we've refused to put it in the cart.
[82:50.10]Where's the... Wait, hold on.
[82:50.88]Hold on.
[82:51.04]We need to find the exit.
[82:52.78]They can do it.
[82:53.34]It's... Oh, man.
[82:55.04]Oh, man.
[82:57.85]I'm going to put my pineapple away now, alright?
[83:02.01]Oops.
[83:02.15]Am I talking to myself?
[83:04.35]Ooh, that makes me want to eat a pineapple.
[83:09.62]Is this truly what solo leveling is like?
[83:11.79]Do you cut your pineapple yourself or do you get the pre-cut?
[83:24.49]Yeah, it's right here.
[83:27.14]But we need to be able to break the horse.
[83:30.88]Okay, listen, we can do the horse together.
[83:35.18]As long as Ghibli doesn't show up.
[83:38.12]Yep.
[83:39.06]I'll get the front.
[83:39.64]I think they got it.
[83:40.20]I think they can do it.
[83:41.08]Why don't we just do that?
[83:42.60]Yeah, I think we're just doing a full drag.
[83:46.14]Oh.
[83:46.94]Oh, shit.
[83:47.82]Oh, no.
[83:49.01]Dude.
[83:49.79]No, no, that was bad.
[83:50.63]That was bad.
[83:51.17]That was a big hit.
[83:54.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[83:54.95]Okay.
[83:55.31]Okay, we got a turn.
[83:56.05]Alright, this way, this way.
[84:01.49]Oh.
[84:02.29]Oh, my God.
[84:02.81]This is going to be worth nothing.
[84:06.79]You run out, perfect.
[84:08.05]You run out, perfect.
[84:10.69]Keep backin' up.
[84:12.45]Keep backin' up.
[84:15.43]And then we're gonna push the cart in right away, because it might be like 3, 2, 1.
[84:22.96]20k's good.
[84:24.42]Sorry about that.
[84:25.04]I didn't realize you were trying to talk to me while I was gone.
[84:27.40]Yes.
[84:28.32]I was just talking about pineapples.
[84:30.66]I said, do you get pre-cut, or do you get, um, do you cut your own pineapple?
[84:34.62]I got pre-cut today.
[84:35.44]What happened?
[84:37.30]Yeah.
[84:39.34]What happened?
[84:39.68]He's here that way.
[84:40.50]Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[84:41.46]Yeah, it was the variety.
[84:42.48]I mean, I say pineapple, but it was variety.
[84:45.08]Oh, hey.
[84:46.74]Hey.
[84:47.96]Yo.
[84:49.16]So, noticed he lost about $20,000 on that golden horse.
[84:52.39]What were you guys talking about?
[84:53.81]What were you guys talking about?
[84:56.16]We're talking about the value.
[84:57.72]We're splitting the value four ways.
[84:59.77]And we saw 20 grand.
[85:01.01]The thing was worth 40 grand originally.
[85:03.13]This is fail RP.
[85:04.99]You were dead.
[85:05.53]You can't say that when it happened.
[85:08.25]Don't fucking tell me what fail RP is, okay?
[85:12.14]You're using meta knowledge right now.
[85:16.22]I don't feel so good, guys.
[85:19.80]Oh, it's a baby.
[85:20.36]It's a boy with a baby.
[85:24.46]Okay, Ghibli, Ghibli, Ghibli, Ghibli.

[86:00.87]I can't whistle.
[86:01.85]I can't whistle.

[86:14.50]Uh.

[88:10.47]Where's the extractor?
[88:11.17]Where is it?
[88:11.53]I don't know where it is.
[88:12.21]Oh my god, it's right here, isn't it?
[88:15.34]I didn't know that I had time limit.
[88:16.36]I didn't know I had a time limit.
[88:17.48]I didn't know that I had a time limit.
[88:18.58]I didn't know.
[88:19.08]I didn't know.
[88:21.08]I didn't know that I had a time limit.
[88:23.14]I forgot there was like a time limit.
[88:24.22]I just thought I was trying to hide from the monsters.
[88:28.50]Monsters!
[88:30.39]I didn't know there was a time limit.
[88:31.73]I forgot, I was like, there was ten monsters everywhere, and I was like, I gotta hide for a minute.
[88:35.01]Oh, no, that was me, because I was supposed to leave.
[88:37.99]I thought it was only me and Poke.
[88:39.65]Oh!
[88:40.79]No, so we won.
[88:41.37]You won.
[88:43.51]Oh.
[88:43.71]Good job.
[88:44.85]Oh, fuck yeah.
[88:45.57]We're good.
[88:46.17]We will need stuff.
[88:47.87]We will need a health thing again, so... Uh, large health pack is worth it, the rest are not worth it.
[88:54.08]It's got the best value, because you get a hundred health.
[88:58.37]Um, health check, everyone?
[89:00.27]I'm at 40.
[89:00.93]I have one, so I should probably get it.
[89:04.55]12,000?
[89:05.35]Yeah, get another 12k.
[89:08.70]Dude, I kind of want the stamina upgrade.
[89:12.56]What the, what is, what?
[89:15.52]Yeah, bring the, so we're gonna get two large health, and then anything else you guys want, just get, whatever you want.
[89:21.89]It'll be worth it.
[89:22.37]I'm a race car, I'm a race car!
[89:24.67]What the fuck is this?
[89:28.65]What is that?
[89:29.17]Right there.
[89:39.22]Tumble launch upgrade.
[89:40.91]And it drives me where I'm looking.
[89:43.37]I have no idea.
[89:44.37]That's cool.
[89:46.07]What is going on with that?
[89:55.52]We need to take some weapons.
[89:56.60]We gotta be able to defend ourselves instead of just screaming Studio Ghibli and running in four directions.
[90:02.72]Getting a stun grenade.
[90:04.90]Getting a stun grenade, because why not?
[90:06.86]Stun grenade's good.
[90:08.60]Usually they have hammers and there's even a gun.
[90:13.05]What were the crystals?
[90:13.87]Stamina regen?
[90:15.61]Oh, sprint, speed, upgrade.
[90:17.95]Is it just for one of us or all of us?
[90:20.19]Uh, one.
[90:21.73]But we have money.
[90:22.47]May as well just buy shit.
[90:23.49]Yeah, you know.
[90:24.50]All the upgrades.
[90:26.19]Do it.
[90:26.65]Buy some upgrades.
[90:29.85]Bro, that big cat thing or lion was like 50k.
[90:33.59]50k?
[90:34.73]Yeah, that was huge.
[90:37.45]Yeah, it was good.
[90:40.75]Feather drone is really good.
[90:41.93]It makes things light.
[90:45.07]How do you get it to target something besides yourself?
[90:47.29]Do you have to rotate it like the other way?
[90:51.51]I've never used it before.
[90:59.92]You shooting him?
[91:02.44]No, it's like you just roll.
[91:07.30]This cot's worth like 47k.
[91:12.62]Cot?
[91:17.29]You can take the Boston out of Vegas, but you can't... Wait, I don't know what I'm saying.
[91:22.81]Yeah, I know what you mean though.
[91:27.48]Alright, I think we've got all the stuff we need.
[91:29.50]I'm just gonna buy all the stuff.
[91:33.28]Oh my goodness.
[91:41.11]You ready, sir?
[91:41.69]Hoppies!
[91:51.43]Weeeeeee!
[91:52.77]Ah!

[92:00.43]Where's Kyok?
[92:03.17]Oh, hey.
[92:09.42]Puppies!
[92:10.16]Oh, I wanted to do the... Hold on.
[92:12.72]Who wants to do the Muppets... Outer Space Muppets with me?
[92:20.28]What does that mean?
[92:23.61]Uh, where you just type, yep, over and over again, like, 50 times, and then you look around.
[92:28.65]You ready?
[92:31.01]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[92:37.78]There we go, that's perfect.
[92:41.04]I was, sorry, I was using all of the, uh, upgrades.
[92:43.62]Wait!
[92:47.99]Okay, who gets what?
[92:48.94]Who gets what?
[92:49.86]I said Jerma, get health, full health.
[92:51.96]I'm gonna share with Poke.
[92:56.50]Okay.
[92:58.14]Me and you, we give Poke a little... There we go.
[93:01.85]Poke of health.
[93:02.63]There you go.
[93:03.07]Thank you, guys.
[93:04.23]I'm gonna get a stamina upgrade.
[93:06.83]There's strength and more stamina available.
[93:09.43]I took a stamina upgrade.
[93:12.97]I like to run.
[93:13.62]Alright.
[93:17.90]What?
[93:19.02]Nothing.
[93:20.46]What was that?
[93:22.04]That was scary.
[93:23.79]Nothing.
[93:24.07]Who wants a strength upgrade?
[93:25.93]No, not me.
[93:27.77]That would be a waste.
[93:29.35]I know that now.
[93:31.23]It's a waste.
[93:32.05]I'm going to be like a cockroach dude.
[93:35.21]Something's going to run in the room and I'm going to sprint around in five directions and it's going to step on my head.
[93:38.24]Alright, Ster got it.
[93:40.62]Yeah, Ster should take it.
[93:41.40]Ster is like a gamer.
[93:42.34]He'll kill, he'll play.
[93:44.67]You're a gamer.
[93:45.98]I've never played Path of Exile.
[93:47.90]That sounded like an accusation.
[93:53.18]I play it too!
[93:53.90]It's an accusation.
[94:01.77]Don't listen to this guy.
[94:03.45]I'm scared.
[94:03.97]14k?
[94:04.57]15k?
[94:09.43]Dude, what is that?
[94:11.37]This mainframe is worth 20k.
[94:14.46]Oh, yeah.
[94:16.56]Oh, that's high tech.
[94:17.26]That's pre-war.
[94:18.28]Should we just dump it into the cart?
[94:19.66]I got the plus strength.
[94:23.12]We could put it on the cart to make it easier.
[94:25.54]Watch this door.
[94:26.48]Hold on.
[94:29.02]I'll hold the cart still.
[94:30.96]You just lay it on top.
[94:34.71]All ginger-like.
[94:35.85]Nice.
[94:36.39]Alright.
[94:37.07]Nice.
[94:37.41]Okay, now... I think we should probably just bring it now.
[94:42.92]Yeah, absolutely.
[94:47.30]Can't really see.
[94:49.02]Vinny.
[94:49.40]You're good.
[94:49.94]Straight.
[94:50.26]You're good.
[94:50.92]No way.
[94:51.24]Hold on.
[94:51.54]Great find.
[94:52.34]Yeah, you're good.
[94:52.78]Straight ahead.
[94:53.18]Great find.
[94:54.92]This guy, I'm telling you.
[94:56.02]I know.
[94:56.74]He's one of the best.
[95:00.05]Let's stand this up.
[95:01.17]We have room on the bench.
[95:04.95]We won this one.
[95:06.63]Oh, this one.
[95:07.19]Watch out, back up, back up, back up.
[95:08.31]Oh my god, oh my god, what do I do?
[95:10.57]You're good, you're good, you got it.
[95:13.13]Lucky man.
[95:13.83]Wait, how come it says zero?
[95:18.97]Wait, you're right, what?
[95:23.07]Why does it say zero?
[95:23.97]Oh god, it destroyed it.
[95:25.49]It broke, why though?
[95:27.61]Why did it break?
[95:29.37]Did it not go in correctly?
[95:31.53]Oh, it had to be stood up?
[95:33.51]We crushed it?
[95:35.58]Oh... We didn't crush anything, guys.
[95:38.36]We... I wish we crushed it.
[95:41.62]Okay, now we know.
[95:45.28]There's 20,000.
[95:46.90]I'm gonna start a circus.
[95:49.76]You guys are all in it.
[95:52.76]Oh, can I be a clown?
[95:55.24]Yes.
[95:56.13]Cool.
[95:58.11]Can I be a sad clown?
[96:01.96]Take this.
[96:09.48]Send in the clowns.
[96:11.42]I think that'd be a good act.
[96:15.30]Hey, guys, that'd be a great act.
[96:19.20]Something's there.
[96:20.24]Something weird is there.
[96:21.92]No.
[96:22.96]Something cute.
[96:24.12]Something cute.
[96:24.94]I have a grenade.
[96:25.38]Where should I throw it?
[96:29.02]Oh, this is a flamethrower?
[96:33.55]There's something in there that's really making me feel feelings for the first time in years.
[96:38.39]That's just me, Ster.
[96:40.41]Oh, hey, Vinny.
[96:41.65]Oh, it's a truck.
[96:44.63]Poor little truck.
[96:53.62]See, it's the thing.
[96:56.50]That's what this whole level is, the thing.
[96:59.18]This whole level is the thing.
[97:01.44]Kinda.
[97:02.28]It is it itself.
[97:05.74]We haven't been in here.
[97:07.58]Skip.
[97:12.15]What is over there?
[97:12.61]There's a lot of shit over there.
[97:13.55]What is this?
[97:13.95]This truck is japes.
[97:15.29]There's nothing in there.
[97:21.21]I'm an idiot.
[97:25.82]Shoot it.
[97:27.87]This is the... Oh, it's... Yeah, cool.
[97:30.37]Should we go in it?
[97:31.65]Can we go?
[97:32.99]There's no items in there.
[97:35.47]Looks like we gotta... Oh, wait, there's something.
[97:37.29]There's a clown.
[97:37.61]Yeah, there is.

[97:50.41]It's only 100.
[97:51.28]Hey.
[97:57.67]I don't trust this clown.
[98:00.33]Is this bait?
[98:01.07]Or is this actually... I mean, it says it's worth money.
[98:03.85]You guys are dilly-dallying.
[98:06.43]Yeah, we're shilly-shallying.

[103:23.03]Be careful with the door.
[103:24.33]Oh, man.
[103:24.77]Okay, so let's open the other way.

[103:38.70]Okay, good.
[103:39.96]Is Vinny dead?
[103:40.46]Where are we going, Poke?
[103:41.22]We need directions.
[103:42.90]Uh, hold on, hold on.
[103:44.86]There's a... Ow, my... Ow!
[103:49.60]We don't even know where the exit is, right?
[103:51.07]The fingers are getting all cut up on the wood.
[103:53.79]Yeah, this thing hurts.
[103:54.45]Alright, let's set up some... Yeah, we don't know where the exit is.
[103:59.49]Extraction this way.
[104:04.07]Where?
[104:04.29]I'll show you.
[104:05.42]Yeah, follow me.
[104:06.24]Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, chill!
[104:07.62]We had a method!
[104:08.34]Alright.
[104:10.00]You two, you two go get your goddamn meatballs.
[104:13.82]We're handling this.
[104:14.70]Alright.
[104:16.16]We're gonna make our own, we'll make our own pizza.
[104:18.98]Oh, Vinny, come here.
[104:20.30]Made it, made it at home.
[104:21.00]Yeah, it's gonna have blackjack.
[104:23.00]Oh, cool.
[104:24.39]We, we can make our own pizza at home.
[104:25.83]Sometimes this flamethrower ignites randomly.
[104:29.41]Are we just going in a circle?
[104:30.79]Uh, did we just walk in a circle?
[104:33.33]No, no, no, no, this way.
[104:34.41]Through this door, and then left.
[104:41.19]Guys, are you serious?
[104:42.79]This doesn't represent me.
[104:50.75]Are we going through the door?
[104:54.67]Alright, we are.
[104:57.99]He's cheering us on.
[104:59.13]Where are we going?
[105:00.75]You're going to that door on the left.
[105:04.12]Oh shit, hold on.
[105:06.16]Alright, you go right?
[105:06.90]Yeah, go straight.
[105:11.82]Left.
[105:12.13]Okay, there you go, now you wanna rotate, there you go.
[105:16.07]Good job.
[105:18.71]He was just sick of being in the back, we did not need to rotate.
[105:20.95]We didn't have to walk towards me?
[105:23.45]Oh no, we got room, okay.
[105:26.41]Dearest Melpert, save the other items for the next extraction.
[105:29.27]I think that's you, Poke.
[105:31.63]Yeah, okay.
[105:34.60]Doesn't it just turn into money though?
[105:35.78]Yeah, but... Are we gonna get the money for this?
[105:39.40]Yeah, it's gonna get squished anyway.
[105:44.29]Unless you get it there in three seconds.
[105:45.97]Yeah, it's fine.
[105:47.33]It's good.
[105:54.89]Oh man, big money.
[105:57.19]Oh, we're up to a three extraction.
[106:00.82]This is getting too scary.
[106:05.52]Damn, that thing is huge.
[106:07.04]Oh no, we're going back to the beginning?
[106:08.28]Um, we could have squished it all into one money bag.
[106:12.68]We should ban that viewer.
[106:15.70]Sorry, that was my fault.
[106:17.27]I'll ban myself.
[106:18.93]Okay, cool.
[106:25.97]Uh, something exploded over there.
[106:27.09]Excuse me, please.
[106:34.42]Dream, I know they've changed his voice.
[106:35.78]Oh, sh- Don't tell them.
[106:38.04]Don't fucking say that.
[106:39.70]I saw it.
[106:40.10]I know, but that was too... Please.
[106:41.70]Please.
[106:42.10]Alright, shh.
[106:42.52]Okay.
[106:49.94]This way.
[106:51.78]You know they changed Fork?
[106:55.12]What?
[106:56.62]Yeah, one day.
[106:57.34]He just sounds way different now.
[106:59.68]He's different?
[107:01.12]Why?
[107:01.82]I don't know.
[107:02.54]I don't know.
[107:03.09]He just sounds way different.
[107:08.65]Why?
[107:09.83]I just, I don't know.
[107:15.64]Oh, dude.
[107:18.98]Didn't one of you guys say you're the cart guy?
[107:20.68]You said you're the cart guy.
[107:22.94]You gave up?
[107:23.90]I just copied for you like five minutes ago, by the way, and now you're going to put it on me?
[107:28.20]Oh my god, what are you crashing?
[107:31.51]Oh shit!
[107:33.19]Not good.
[107:35.97]Oh my god, we're losing money.
[107:37.13]Who could have crashed the cart like that?
[107:42.29]Guess you could say I'm crashing out.
[107:44.23]Let's bring the money separate.
[107:46.96]Sir, you got it.
[107:47.70]You're strong.
[107:48.62]There's a gnome.
[107:49.44]There's a gnome.
[107:50.10]I am going to...
[107:59.25]Why did you do a cat hiss?
[108:02.87]I think the gnome just did.
[108:03.91]Alright, fellas, we did it.
[108:10.48]Let's go.
[108:12.40]Good eating.
[108:19.65]Good grab.
[108:23.99]I almost died.
[108:27.60]Alright, and now the map will tell us.
[108:29.28]We just have to follow that arrow, that line.
[108:32.82]We had no Ghiblis.
[108:34.90]Not a- which, thank god.
[108:36.93]No Saurons, no Ghiblis, no Fa- Oh, fuck!
[108:40.11]Ah, a Gib!
[108:41.83]Watch out!
[108:42.39]I threw a grenade at us!
[108:49.01]How do you throw the grenade?
[108:50.31]I'm sorry, I tried to warn everybody as fast as I could.
[108:54.80]How do you throw the grenade?
[108:57.73]It says E for grenade and you just drop it on the ground.
[109:00.25]What the fuck is going on over there, man?
[109:07.53]To me now, they're stunned.
[109:09.10]To me?
[109:09.56]Okay, I'm coming.
[109:10.26]I'm coming.
[109:10.56]Run, run, run, run to Vinny.
[109:11.80]Run to Vinny.
[109:12.42]Run to my voice.
[109:13.62]Run past them.
[109:14.68]Let's go.
[109:28.97]Good job.
[109:30.01]You're doing a good job.
[109:31.09]Good, good, good.
[109:31.75]Nice, excellent work.
[109:32.75]You did all the work.
[109:33.47]Is anyone else alive?
[109:34.75]Is anyone else alive?
[109:36.19]I don't believe so.
[109:41.29]We'll give him 10 seconds.
[109:43.44]Vinny, I have a question about projectiles.
[109:48.14]Yeah?
[109:49.30]So if you have a grenade in your hand... Yeah?
[109:55.10]And you want to throw the grenade How do you throw the grenade without dropping it on your teammates accidentally twice?
[110:03.39]Yeah, you just Yep, and then that's how you do it and that's how you do it.
[110:10.87]Yeah The same way that would like we're throwing the gnomes.
[110:14.87]Oh, okay My life lasts before my eyes.
[110:18.51]I just I
[110:22.18]Okay, so for future reference, let me be the one that has, like, you know, strike two, so no strike three.
[110:27.28]If you have a grenade, you have to, like, whip it.
[110:33.88]Right now, you can take some stuff and practice throwing them, because this stuff doesn't matter.
[110:39.86]What does the rubber duck do?
[110:43.62]Oh.
[110:44.12]It quacks.
[110:45.34]It appears it quacks.
[110:47.77]Someone said inspect one of the roof tiles.
[110:51.63]Huh?
[110:58.80]What do you mean?
[111:00.12]Aligned with the lights?

[111:27.55]I think it's the second cart, I believe.
[111:29.29]It's between the light and the ship.
[111:36.95]Equip the pen.
[111:41.21]It's really good to jump and hold left click to find the movable tile.
[111:50.87]I think I'm good.
[111:52.03]I put all the stuff in there.
[111:53.35]Alright, press the button.

[113:02.26]What is it?
[113:03.58]I can't even describe it.
[113:04.64]It's so cool.
[113:05.40]Alright, well, you gotta pull us up.
[113:12.51]Use the mill.
[113:13.29]Scroll wheel.
[113:14.01]That helps.
[113:15.09]Okay, cool.
[113:16.33]Apparently, there's sometimes items up there, but not today.
[113:20.35]Something really messed up up here.
[113:27.85]I'm leaving.
[113:29.38]Yeah, it's not that exciting.
[113:30.50]It's just like a kind of a goon cave situation.
[113:33.36]Kind of weird.
[113:34.02]That guy was dead up there.
[113:44.21]Are you implying that guy gooned himself to death up there?
[113:48.49]I think so.
[113:50.67]Oh.
[113:51.83]Number one, I had quite the goon chamber when I was in Starfleet Academy.
[114:11.50]Recharging!
[114:12.28]Gear up!
[114:14.36]Polk, you need health.
[114:16.30]What did we buy?
[114:17.12]Someone bought a frying pan?
[114:18.46]What else did we get?
[114:20.52]Should I take this large health pack?
[114:23.53]I have one HP.
[114:24.51]I'll give you all of my health.
[114:26.67]Whoever has one should take it, and then we can all share.
[114:30.58]Anything destructive, like any weapon?
[114:32.46]I'll give you mine.
[114:33.68]Jerma, you're not allowed anymore.
[114:36.52]No grenades.
[114:37.18]Who's not topped off?
[114:38.12]No grenades.
[114:39.46]I'm 60, so what do you have right now, Poe?
[114:42.35]Ten.
[114:42.57]I'll give you all of mine, get to one, and then I'll use this full health pack.
[114:46.45]Okay, sounds good.
[114:47.33]That's all I can give you.
[114:48.31]Maybe one more.
[114:52.61]Alright, I don't need any more.
[114:53.69]You could just give it to a Jerm or... We could both use one or two ticks.
[115:02.29]I'm at 70.
[115:04.93]Okay, I'm at 60.
[115:06.67]51.

[115:10.69]Alright, roll all our 60s.
[115:18.84]Thankfully, not yet.
[115:27.43]That sounds like a Hideo Kojima character.
[115:40.84]Grown Assman.

[117:21.66]Where are they?
[117:22.10]I'm going in with the pan.
[117:25.08]It was something on the wall and looked like a big spider.
[117:28.54]And then it disappeared.
[117:34.35]I'm coming!
[117:34.97]I'm coming!
[117:35.41]I'm coming!
[117:35.81]I'm coming!

[117:41.17]I'm coming!
[117:47.26]Oh God!
[117:47.86]How did he get me too?
[117:51.89]What am I even looking at?
[117:53.15]I was like 30 feet away from him.
[117:55.09]Wait, how is Poke alive?
[117:58.83]I can put a trap here.
[117:59.87]I thought he was smothering Poke.
[118:01.35]I thought he was like grabbing him and sucking his blood out.
[118:03.81]That's why I freaked out.
[118:04.92]Poke was fine?
[118:05.90]Yeah, he was fine and almost... Wait, wait, wait.
[118:11.04]It comes, it comes.
[118:12.98]That wasn't even close.
[118:14.74]Wow, yeah, why did you die?
[118:16.20]Yeah, no, we have to go the other way.
[118:18.10]He has a gravity mace, he pulls you in.
[118:20.20]Oh, man.
[118:20.66]Are they both dead?
[118:23.28]Uh, alright, well... Oh, 34k!
[118:30.91]They're not gonna get this grand piano, there's no way.
[118:36.93]Guys?
[118:39.19]Guys?
[118:39.53]If you dropkick the robots with enough force, you can damage them.
[118:45.10]don't want to do that alright we found that one we gotta find the next place we need to find their heads and we can revive them in the start can't we can you oh that was a big decrease I thought we had one here I'm so bad there's nothing
[119:11.51]There's footsteps!
[119:13.79]What is that?
[119:14.83]Oh!
[119:15.25]He got me again!
[119:16.45]Help!
[119:18.29]Help!
[119:20.11]Oh my god.
[119:20.73]Oh man!
[119:24.16]I don't even see what's carrying him.
[119:26.28]Yeah, what is go- This is so confusing.
[119:28.08]It's just invisible.
[119:28.84]What?
[119:29.12]They went by- He went by the monster I freaked out and attacked.
[119:31.96]I didn't- So what?
[119:33.46]I think he's fine.
[119:35.34]It's like a ghost.
[119:37.06]That's two monsters.
[119:42.35]I was under the assumption that that big guy with the huge eye, I thought that was what grabbed him.
[119:56.96]That was just a different monster that was just there, that I aggroed.
[120:01.56]Oh.
[120:05.42]Well how much damage do you think he did to it?
[120:07.54]I think he did like two solid hits with a frying pan?
[120:12.76]Oh god, Star is getting... decimated.
[120:15.70]Wow, that was close.
[120:24.88]So... Oh shit, Poke is hiding from the big scary thing.
[120:27.70]Yeah.
[120:28.64]Yeah, he's... oh god.
[120:32.04]I don't think we're coming back.
[120:53.31]Hello?
[120:56.46]Oh my god.
[120:57.18]Oh, I thought that was... Okay, I thought his arm was the guy's eye.
[120:59.86]I was about to say, holy shit, that's horrifying.
[121:01.58]I just need a moment.
[121:14.49]No!
[121:14.63]No!
[121:17.84]They're both doing the same thing.
[121:31.38]Hey, you're not- NO!
[121:32.86]OH FUCK!
[121:34.77]I wasn't collecting the corpses, I put everything into the bag.
[121:40.91]Did you find the thing?
[121:42.11]Dude, I was in the basement getting just spawned a door can by the big guy.
[121:49.11]Did you find the exit?
[121:51.09]No.
[121:52.57]There was a room over here, I was gonna go check this room.
[121:57.73]Where is the basement?
[121:58.53]This place is all...
[122:05.43]Oh shit.
[122:06.01]Ster has one health.
[122:08.31]Yeah, I knew it.
[122:09.43]Game sense.
[122:10.81]Okay.
[122:11.25]Everybody's head is in the cart.
[122:14.25]Okay.
[122:15.63]We might be back.
[122:17.49]Damn.
[122:18.87]We might have it.
[122:19.95]It's possible.
[122:21.61]I think there's like... Someone said there's like something very expensive.
[122:28.26]Nearby.
[122:28.66]God.
[122:29.70]It's right there.
[122:36.02]So that thing has the most HP in the game.
[122:37.46]That's apparently one of the hardest, scariest things in the game.
[122:42.92]Oh, man.
[122:47.56]I think he's good.
[122:54.13]Oh, shit.
[122:55.63]Okay, take it right.
[122:56.51]Yep.
[123:03.24]Yeah, you're a pro.
[123:05.44]Damn.
[123:06.58]Damn.
[123:10.37]Okay, let's bring it to me.
[123:11.21]Uh, remember the 12k?
[123:14.01]Uh, there's a piano out there worth 30 or something.
[123:15.91]Yeah, they gotta get that piano.
[123:19.17]But there's, there is that monster.
[123:22.33]Yeah.
[123:22.81]Oh, man.
[123:27.33]So do you play with the, uh, the crusty filter on?
[123:29.42]Do you turn it off?
[123:31.20]Read that.
[123:32.72]Um...
[123:35.50]I have the graphics on pixelation default.
[123:39.26]Yeah, so it's like a little crusty, but not too bad.
[123:44.22]How about you?
[123:44.86]I like it.
[123:45.34]I think it adds to it.
[123:46.62]Yeah, I don't mind like a light pixelation filter in some games.
[123:51.42]I think it's pretty good.
[123:52.72]It's kind of gives you a chance to... I don't know what it does, but I like it.
[124:03.86]It adds a little bit of extra oomph.
[124:05.44]A little bit of extra crunchiness.
[124:07.51]There's no way they're going to get that thing downstairs, by the way.
[124:13.79]They need the pie aner.
[124:15.11]Oh, nice.
[124:15.49]You got a coffee mug.
[124:18.79]Was that sarcasm?
[124:20.79]Uh, come with me.
[124:23.27]I think there's some... I think there's a small thing we can grab up here.
[124:31.30]Okay.
[124:39.34]But if you want to do Monster Hunter Ketchup That's my favorite part.
[124:46.59]That's my favorite game in the series.
[124:48.57]I also like Monster Hunter Mustard.
[124:51.95]Yeah, Monster Hunter Relish was a little too complicated, I think, for a lot of people.
[124:56.77]Yeah, yeah, but sorry, I ruined a nice sentiment.
[125:01.88]I'm down.
[125:02.56]We can play.
[125:03.42]I mean, if we also, if we get bored of this tonight, I'm down to play it after.
[125:07.07]It's fine.
[125:08.71]Oh, God.
[125:10.52]But yeah, Joel is actually going to be in town here in New York City.
[125:14.73]New York City.
[125:16.67]Really?
[125:18.09]Yeah, this weekend.
[125:19.13]So we're going to be doing New York things like make it a pizza.

[125:26.36]You got to get the meatball.
[125:27.58]He's got to enjoy that meatball.
[125:29.08]Yeah.
[125:33.36]I thought they were talking to us.
[125:35.62]I thought they were asking for us.
[125:37.25]I'm like, wait, how can they hear us?
[125:38.29]Poke, don't break it.
[125:39.71]Poke, don't break it.

[125:40.99]Poke, you're breaking it.
[125:43.72]Yeah.
[125:44.90]It's the best pizza I've ever had in my whole life.
[125:48.27]And that's good.
[125:48.91]I'm glad.
[125:49.39]I'm glad I could bring you to a place.
[125:51.29]That's my favorite place.
[125:52.25]I think I tell the chat all the time.

[129:55.70]Slenderman, Slenderman, Slenderman.
[130:03.35]Should we stand him up?
[130:05.55]Oof.
[130:11.40]This is not a good operation you guys got going on here.

[130:18.47]He's on the other side of the door now.

[130:56.88]I think we're okay.
[130:59.24]Vinny's alive.
[131:00.94]Vinny's alive?
[131:01.62]Oh, no.
[131:02.08]Run.
[131:14.62]oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god okay
[131:47.61]Someone just got killed.
[131:59.44]Oh, thank God.
[132:00.10]Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.
[132:02.29]Vinny, oh my God.
[132:03.11]So glad to see another person.
[132:05.05]Yeah, yeah.
[132:05.67]I've been steadily acquiring materials.
[132:07.75]We only need a little bit more.
[132:10.24]There were two really scary monsters out there.
[132:12.66]And I don't know what happened to Poke, but we split up, and I don't know, he might be dead.
[132:18.25]If we were... Is this our... This is our last one, so we can finish right with the statue.
[132:25.43]Statue or anything.
[132:26.83]Anything.
[132:27.30]Or the piano was right here.
[132:28.76]We can drag this piano.
[132:29.74]Ah...
[132:40.06]Other way.
[132:41.02]Yeah, you're good.
[132:45.39]No, other way.
[132:46.03]Other way, man.
[132:46.55]On that hallway.
[132:49.83]Sorry.
[132:52.13]I'm hanging on by a thread.
[132:54.03]Ooh, look.
[132:57.40]Hold on.
[132:58.14]I'm going to hold it.
[132:58.72]I'll just hold it.
[133:00.46]I'll walk with you.
[133:02.26]Has no one seen this monster?
[133:04.72]He's barely hanging on.
[133:13.27]There we go.
[133:13.71]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[133:15.57]You're halfway there.
[133:17.69]There we go, good.
[133:18.35]Perfect.
[133:19.59]That's the song of your people, you know?
[133:21.53]That's Bon Jovi's... You're going the wrong way.
[133:23.91]It is straight down this hallway.
[133:26.03]Oh no, it's a statue!
[133:32.35]The music of your people, Bon Jersey.
[133:35.63]Okay, two of us can just carry this.
[133:37.35]Putting it inside of the cart is making it more difficult.
[133:39.55]This way?
[133:39.89]This way?
[133:40.47]The cart already facing the correct way.
[133:42.98]Yeah, just card it, I think.
[133:45.06]What's wrong?
[133:45.53]Um, what happened?
[133:46.71]Bye.
[133:48.99]What happened?
[133:53.93]Poke?
[133:56.99]Poke?
[133:57.83]Poke, are you here?
[134:05.14]Usually Poke gets dragged down here, so...
[134:17.90]I gotta get back there.
[134:18.56]Can I get the piano?
[134:33.82]Will they think I'm cool if I get the piano?
[134:35.87]Unprompted?
[134:39.69]I can't get it.
[134:48.72]No, no, no, no!
[134:50.28]I- No, I was- Help!
[134:52.82]I- I was on the way back!
[134:55.78]Oh my god.
[134:56.46]Are you gonna leave me alone?
[135:07.95]This- This ghost is fucking annoying.
[135:14.79]Okay.
[135:15.63]Let's try this again.
[135:17.31]I'm going this way.
[135:17.99]I'll cut around here.
[135:20.71]Build the stamina up.
[135:21.41]I don't want to lose stamina.
[135:24.37]It's not my fault that I'm going to die.
[135:27.67]Where is it?
[135:28.15]Right there.
[135:31.73]I don't think I'm going to make it.
[135:34.39]Guys, I don't think I'm going to make it.
[135:35.25]I'm going to try, though.
[135:43.27]I made it.
[135:45.16]Did I?
[135:45.48]Wait, did I make it?
[135:49.61]Wait a second.
[135:49.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[135:50.87]Is this right?
[135:56.20]Okay, I'm good.
[135:57.24]I'm just gonna wait.
[136:01.46]No sense going out there and dying.
[136:18.09]Okay, shh.
[136:27.36]Is this the wrong truck?
[136:44.01]wrong truck what do you mean wrong truck wrong truck wrong truck no that's one guy that was like 20 guys
[137:14.08]I WAS SUPPOSED TO SCARE YOU!
[137:15.30]WHAT THE FUCK!
[137:16.32]I WAS SUPPOSED TO SCARE YOU!
[137:19.18]OH MY GOD, MY HEART IS EXPLODING!
[137:22.06]I WAS TRYING TO SCARE... DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK!
[137:37.48]I... this didn't... I'm sorry, man.
[137:43.19]It's alright.
[137:43.63]Wait, how did I die?
[137:44.41]I don't remember.
[137:44.87]Oh, there was a Slender.
[137:46.63]Yeah, yeah.
[137:48.49]We should check the special score first.
[137:53.55]Indestructible drone.
[137:55.29]So there's a drone here that will make one object, like, fully indestructible.
[137:58.60]It's kind of amazing, actually.
[138:01.86]Could be cool.
[138:03.32]Um... I thought this was a pump.
[138:06.66]Like, I actually thought... We have a gun, guys.
[138:09.52]Do we always have a gun?
[138:12.63]What's that?
[138:14.27]You know.
[138:14.69]You know what kind of pump.
[138:15.61]I just never saw it.
[138:18.86]Oh, gun.
[138:19.34]Yeah.
[138:19.48]Oh, yeah.
[138:20.62]Gun.
[138:22.00]We kind of need this.
[138:24.32]If you want a gun, I'm not going to stop you.
[138:26.10]I think it's a great idea.
[138:27.20]Oh, sorry.
[138:30.64]That's okay.
[138:31.06]Don't get the two healths.
[138:32.52]The mediums are a waste.
[138:33.77]Always get three because you get more value.
[138:36.21]Two is 50.
[138:36.93]Three is 100.
[138:37.63]You get more for your money.
[138:39.83]Oh, this is like all of our money, by the way.
[138:41.45]How many bolts are in it?
[138:44.70]I saw this, uh, I saw that in QVC.
[138:49.74]Um, how much, wait, wait, I need a health check, because we might be, we... Health check?
[138:54.70]Uh, 26?
[138:58.10]One.
[138:58.30]Why don't we check that roof room?
[139:04.83]Oh, the roof room, yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[139:07.55]How about you check the room your computer's in?
[139:13.03]He's eating pasta.
[139:13.91]Let him eat his pasta in peace.
[139:15.07]Thank you, Vinny.
[139:16.17]Oh, okay.
[139:16.89]I was saying that.
[139:17.55]That's why you sound so far away.
[139:19.01]It's a new mic.
[139:19.95]It's a new mic.
[139:25.22]It's not Alfredo, is it?
[139:26.22]Is it a red sauce?
[139:26.92]Is it a white sauce?
[139:27.56]What is it?
[139:30.18]Red sauce spaghetti.
[139:34.28]Alfredo spaghetti.
[139:35.94]That sounds good.
[139:37.04]So good.
[139:39.12]I'm on my last few bites, though.
[139:41.65]Okay, so hang on.
[139:42.79]I don't think we can afford one of these if we want to have decent health.
[139:46.63]So... I would say the strength upgrade might be a little bit... A $44,000 gun might be a problem.
[139:55.79]Wow.
[139:56.91]I feel like we should just get more stuff and less gun.
[139:59.09]We don't need a gun.
[139:59.85]How many bullets does the gun have?
[140:03.36]Oh my god, I killed him.
[140:05.93]Oh my god, I didn't... I thought we were in the training fun area.
[140:08.39]I didn't think... I didn't think... I thought you had to buy it first before you could use it!
[140:13.34]Hang on.
[140:14.24]Let's do a funeral.
[140:15.54]Jerma, follow me.
[140:18.60]Shit.
[140:21.38]I thought you had to pay for it first.
[140:24.61]He was untenable.
[140:26.89]He was unendable.
[140:29.21]He shall be sorely missed.
[140:31.67]Rest in piss, our dear friend Ster.
[140:36.61]Yeah, might as well just... Yeah.
[140:45.18]Can I bring one of you guys up to the secret room?
[140:56.78]Uh, yeah, let's do it.
[140:59.20]I can't even hear Poke, but yeah.
[141:01.22]Alright, it's... Why are you so quiet?
[141:02.64]I'm really right here!
[141:05.34]I can't even... I can't even hear him.
[141:06.89]He's even more muffled!
[141:09.87]Jerma, what do you think?
[141:10.55]Do we buy the gun?
[141:11.89]Or do we... do we not?
[141:14.47]Um, I just killed Ster with it.
[141:15.85]I think the ha-ha funny thing that was potential, uh... I think we got our 44,000 worth and it was free.
[141:22.84]Oh my god, I thought you don't... Oh my god.
[141:24.44]Nah, I'm kidding.
[141:25.22]I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[141:25.96]Alright, yeah, yeah.
[141:26.70]Alright, let's just get health.
[141:27.62]I found a human grenade.
[141:29.96]Keep it.
[141:30.54]Use that shit.
[141:31.17]Yeah.
[141:33.97]Wait, human?
[141:34.77]Oh.
[141:35.81]Should I press E on it?
[141:38.41]If you do, we're going to be in a lot of trouble.
[141:42.95]Yeah.
[141:43.50]Are you sure?
[141:45.52]I think we just get tons of upgrades.
[141:48.90]Let's buy it.
[141:49.38]It's only 2k.
[141:50.14]We should buy it.
[141:50.62]We need to save our lives.
[141:53.48]2k is good.
[141:54.06]Yeah, that's good.
[141:55.86]So we have... Alright, how much health do we have?
[141:57.74]We have two full healths.
[141:59.52]That should be good.
[142:02.65]What happened?
[142:05.76]You still shoot?
[142:06.32]Oh wait, this thing is dangerous.
[142:07.42]We need to get rid of this.
[142:13.31]Wait, what?
[142:13.85]Wait, what are you doing aiming at yourself?
[142:18.05]Stop!
[142:20.25]Stop!
[142:20.99]Wait, I didn't... You can... I didn't want to do that.
[142:28.66]Now why?
[142:29.10]Now you're doing it!
[142:36.43]I'm gonna grab a stun grenade.
[142:43.08]I'm gonna get it.
[142:43.62]I have a game, I have a game.
[142:44.38]I'm gonna spin it.
[142:46.38]Okay, spin it and farm.
[142:47.16]I'm gonna see you one time.
[142:48.80]Ready?
[142:50.32]Oh shit, hold on.
[142:51.74]Just gonna stay away from that.
[142:53.06]As far away as possible.
[142:54.34]Alright, here's a... I'm ready.
[143:01.16]Ooh, that was good.
[143:02.42]We both got one point.
[143:03.82]Alright, Vinny, call it.
[143:06.11]heads oh three two one oh he's gone he shot himself right in the face by the way he picked it up dude he picked it up like this and he turned it this way and he shot himself right in the face my joke up what a disaster what a nightmare
[143:34.68]Alright.
[143:35.22]It's fine.
[143:35.78]It's fine.
[143:36.87]Um, okay.
[143:37.51]So I think we're good.
[143:38.17]We have everything we need.
[143:39.51]Um, I bought a bunch of shit.
[143:40.83]Mostly upgrades.
[143:41.73]We can hoard all of them.
[143:45.49]We're gonna... Oh my god.
[143:46.83]Put them in the buy zone?
[143:49.77]Wait, they're gonna come back, right?
[143:54.64]Will they not come back?
[143:59.02]Careful with that, buddy.
[144:06.47]I was like, he's gonna die, isn't he?
[144:07.85]Why would I kill myself to eat right there?
[144:12.30]Whoever has one, grab the other health.
[144:18.28]What do I get for being killed?
[144:19.88]Take whatever you want.
[144:22.82]I got stuff for all of us.
[144:23.75]You can have a strength upgrade, and you can have the health upgrade, and you can have... You can take the pan, too.
[144:30.25]I mean, you are the pan guy, right?
[144:33.03]Equip the pan.
[144:34.33]See?
[144:36.46]Um, Spoke, how much health do you have?
[144:38.56]I'm at one, so I should take one.
[144:40.10]Yeah, grab one.
[144:42.25]I'm at 40.
[144:44.25]46 on me.
[144:45.01]Alright, so... Yeah, we're gonna give some health.
[144:47.35]We're gonna share some health.
[144:48.33]Alright, Jeremiah, I'm gonna... Alright, I'll go Ster.
[144:51.71]I am gobbling.
[144:55.43]Oh, you fucking weirdo.
[144:57.15]Stop that.
[144:59.53]What?
[145:03.98]It says a lot about you, Test 2.
[145:07.15]I cannot hear you.
[145:09.15]Why?
[145:10.51]Because you're looking.
[145:11.41]Are you in the other room, Polk?
[145:14.70]Wait, what happened to me?
[145:16.18]Wait, hello?
[145:16.80]We can hear you now.
[145:18.20]Oh, I thought I left the game.
[145:20.62]Yeah, I turned myself up to 86%.
[145:21.60]I never had like this.
[145:24.04]Oh, there you are.
[145:25.04]Am I good now?
[145:26.20]Sound perfect.
[145:26.56]Yeah, you're good.
[145:28.64]Sorry, guys.
[145:31.84]Marion Cooper.
[145:36.52]Oh, that laugh.
[145:37.32]I thought that was a guy.
[145:38.27]He said something funny.
[145:42.81]I mean, you are the monster.
[145:43.95]I haven't died to monsters, but I've died to you throwing a grenade and you shooting me in the face.
[145:50.13]Classic.
[145:50.93]Walter.
[145:59.69]Sorry.
[146:00.84]It's been a while.
[146:01.40]We haven't had a Walter in a while.
[146:03.38]Apparently I need a... Is there an upgrade for me?
[146:08.66]Name's Mike.
[146:10.30]Mike check.
[146:14.72]I got a trophy.
[146:15.98]I hear someone's chair squeaking.
[146:18.12]Did Ster take it?
[146:27.97]There's no upgrades in here for me.
[146:30.45]I got nothing in here.
[146:48.93]Okay.
[146:50.23]I'll try not to.
[147:19.31]Can you get him to jump into the pit?
[147:21.54]I would love that.
[147:23.08]I would love nothing more.
[147:24.08]Yeah, maybe he'll jump up and fall in the hole.
[147:38.41]I could have caught it!
[147:42.13]I did catch it.
[147:45.83]Oh, I thought this was a nice decorative plate.
[147:47.95]This is Vinny's head.
[147:51.80]Look, go get him.
[147:52.64]He's over there.
[147:54.18]He's over there.
[147:54.68]Get it.
[148:03.06]Why are you doing this?
[148:05.71]Why are you so cruel to me, felon?
[148:08.15]Finally.
[148:08.55]Okay, um, Vinny fell in the hole, and then I was trying... This thing was distracting Vinny, and then I just killed it.
[148:13.91]So, uh, we're... I think we're fine.
[148:17.81]Wait, this is Poke.
[148:19.01]Wait, what?
[148:19.73]Yeah.
[148:20.11]What's going on?
[148:20.63]We're both dead.
[148:22.19]Why did Poke's head come up when Vinny fell down?
[148:24.39]I'm so confused.
[148:28.73]I don't know.
[148:30.97]It was like he chewed him up and like gargled up and spit the bones out, but the bones were a different guy.
[148:34.78]All I know is we have a gamer obligation to return this.
[148:40.86]We have enough money.
[148:42.06]Oh, Vinny had Poke.
[148:43.18]Oh, okay.
[148:44.20]Alright, let's get out of here then.
[148:53.45]me me me backing up oh you're going you're going in you're going in no what don't push me in don't do it no no no that's not wicked funny oh my god oh my god
[149:19.75]Wait, why is it over for us?
[149:21.95]Why am I dead?
[149:22.79]Something came and grabbed Jerma.
[149:27.03]Wait, you won?
[149:28.65]Why am I not... Why am I... He was under it.
[149:32.82]He was under it.
[149:36.24]I got crushed, but how come I didn't get... Wouldn't my head be in there when it got crushed at the same time?
[149:40.54]I was just trying to make Ster happy.
[149:44.37]That's all I was trying to do.
[149:45.39]I was trying to make Ster laugh.
[149:48.65]And he didn't even, he was like, oh I'm gonna throw you in, I'm gonna throw you in, here we go!
[149:52.58]So I was like, okay, when you do something like that, when you trigger a YouTuber to, okay, this is what we're doing now.
[150:01.90]Like my YouTuber sense went off because he was like, I'm gonna push you in!
[150:05.36]So it's like, okay, whoa, that's funny.
[150:06.85]Okay, haha.
[150:14.64]One of us clicked a duck, one of us fell in a pit, and one of us got killed by the crusher.
[150:18.90]Yeah, well, I just relapsed for a second.
[150:20.40]The gun would not have helped us.
[150:21.56]What was that?
[150:24.97]That is my stomach.
[150:27.23]Oh.
[150:31.14]What a...
[150:39.39]Alright, let's see if we can find the next extract.
[150:41.74]You relapsed on being a YouTuber.
[150:48.65]They're in trouble here.
[150:49.41]This is not safe.
[150:50.31]This place is huge.
[150:57.05]That's improv?
[151:00.61]I did it on purpose.
[151:02.15]I was trying to make Ster say, I can't believe it.
[151:05.48]I say leave it until we find the exit.
[151:07.70]Yeah.
[151:08.50]Yeah, haha, look at me.
[151:09.60]Exactly.
[151:12.16]He found it.
[151:13.38]I think he found it.
[151:14.56]What that noise was.
[151:16.20]Wait, hold on.
[151:19.59]The title is great.
[151:20.67]You gotta read the title first.
[151:21.63]Come on.
[151:23.25]Where are you?
[151:24.13]Oh.
[151:26.49]Ow.
[151:32.39]Ow.
[151:32.67]Yeah, I can't.
[151:36.58]I love that Vinny is just here alone.
[151:39.04]And they're playing the Burger King game.
[151:47.05]And now they're looking for him.
[151:48.27]They would have just, they left him.
[152:07.32]he'll get it he'll get it he's just having fun
[152:37.53]Those are some cool moves.
[152:40.37]Did I just lose all my health?
[152:45.29]Nice cup.
[152:59.36]The back of my head is so... My back is so itchy.
[153:02.21]Can you catch it?
[153:03.41]Eight seconds.
[153:06.62]Yeah, I got you.
[153:07.60]There you go.
[153:08.00]Thank you.
[153:09.20]Thank you.
[153:11.28]We don't want to bring that computer here.
[153:16.37]It's an emerald cup?
[153:18.41]Oh, okay.
[153:21.83]Fuck.
[153:24.57]Where am I going?
[153:26.55]Not here.
[153:27.27]Hey, buddy.
[153:36.70]What's happening?
[153:37.78]Oh, sorry.
[153:38.60]How we doing?
[153:41.31]Not too bad.
[153:43.73]This is a bad spot, though, so be careful of the plank.
[153:50.25]Alright.
[153:50.65]Any expensive stuff, I figured the next one would be a better place for it.
[153:58.05]No jokes.
[153:59.13]Stop doing jokes.
[154:00.74]Don't joke at me.
[154:04.41]Something fucked is in here with us.
[154:06.65]Something fucked.
[154:08.25]The music just changed.
[154:09.42]Oh, God, there's a thing.
[154:10.44]There's a thing.
[154:11.94]It's fleshy.
[154:15.60]The voice changer thing.
[154:16.56]Whoa, what?
[154:17.25]Squidward!
[154:19.09]Oh, what is that?
[154:19.81]It's a fucking weird alien thing, man.
[154:21.19]I'm hiding.
[154:23.51]I got one health.
[154:32.09]Don't move.
[154:32.89]You're hiding behind a computer monitor.
[154:36.75]Oh my god, what?
[154:37.53]Are you okay?
[154:40.89]I think so.
[154:42.66]You know, I've been thinking.
[154:44.60]I just really want to go to sleep.
[154:48.82]Hey, open your mouth.
[154:49.54]Wait, did I kill him?
[154:55.50]I almost died, dude.
[154:58.67]I almost died, dude.
[155:00.49]Dude, chill.
[155:02.38]Hey, if somebody goes, uh... Dremel's freaking TKN, dude.
[155:10.41]Okay, I'm fine now.
[155:16.33]He's running after somebody else.
[155:17.41]Watch out, he's coming.
[155:19.77]Here, you know what?
[155:20.93]Give me.
[155:22.23]Wait, where's my frying pan?
[155:23.33]Do I break it on someone's head?
[155:24.71]Oh...
[155:32.08]He wanted the funny voice.
[155:33.74]I get it.
[155:34.20]He wanted the funny voice, but that's too bad.
[155:38.59]Yeah, that's rough.
[155:40.89]Where'd Vinny go?
[155:43.89]Vinny went down this hallway, but watch out.
[155:45.89]There's a Squidward.
[155:46.71]A Squidward?
[155:48.79]I don't like that thing at all.
[155:52.98]Yo, I found a skeleton in gelatin down here.
[155:55.78]Skeleton in gelatin.
[155:57.39]That's gotta be worth a lot.
[155:59.29]It's cool.
[155:59.83]It's really cool.
[156:00.67]I'll show you.
[156:01.57]Hold on.
[156:01.93]This computer is worth millions.
[156:05.09]22k.
[156:06.45]We should figure out where we're going, I guess.
[156:09.03]Yeah, that's good.
[156:11.91]Oh, skeleton in gelatin.
[156:13.91]You were not lying.
[156:15.71]Actually, wow.
[156:16.77]Skeleton in gelatin.
[156:17.79]Yeah.
[156:23.41]He's Elef on the Elephant, see him go.
[156:25.69]Let me go on the top.
[156:26.91]I have strength 3.
[156:30.03]I'm a Skeleton and Gelatin, don't you know?
[156:34.45]You know.
[156:36.19]You're a Skeleton and Gelatin, see him flow.
[156:39.23]Oh no.
[156:41.94]I'm stuck in here, get me out before I go!
[156:45.20]And you have like a take of two minutes to collect all the gel on the ground or something?
[156:51.71]We gotta put it on top.
[156:55.20]Put it on top.
[156:57.02]Put it on top.
[156:58.80]I don't think it's gonna be easy.
[157:00.00]Somebody move Poke's head.
[157:01.80]Because it's balancing on top of Poke's head right now.
[157:05.97]Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[157:07.05]It's gonna get weird, I think.
[157:09.75]That guy's got a freaking... So it's fine.
[157:16.66]The skeleton and gelatin's going to fall.
[157:25.70]We don't know where we're going yet.
[157:27.60]Oh no!
[157:28.16]It seems I've been turned into a wall!
[157:36.23]And the game was made with fucking lead.
[157:37.85]And they've been in that fucking massive lawsuit.
[157:43.03]Okay.
[157:44.47]You guys look like demons.
[157:48.67]That's something weird.
[157:49.21]Let me go look.
[157:52.55]oh that's a weird thing!
[157:54.47]bad thing!
[158:03.38]no skeleton and gelatin that's what I'm talking about is that a real song drama that you or no or did you just make that melody up?
[158:15.74]it's coming!
[158:25.26]I hear locating.
[158:31.35]Here we go.
[158:32.03]It got up here.
[158:33.13]It actually got up here.
[158:38.81]We found the elephant commercial song.
[158:41.67]You guys are going to give me nightmares with this elephant stuff.
[158:49.67]I'm.
[158:49.85]A.
[158:57.01]I'm dreaming.
[158:59.99]Is it safe to go back and get all of our cool stuff?
[159:03.61]Yeah.
[159:07.29]That thing had blades for hands.
[159:08.52]I don't know about that.
[159:10.26]Edward Scissorhand was the good guy in that movie.
[159:12.80]If you don't recall.
[159:14.30]He was really just misunderstood by society.
[159:18.64]Did Edward Scissorhand accidentally kill a guy in that movie or am I...
[159:25.19]Uh, I believe it was an accident.
[159:26.95]I don't know if it happened at all.
[159:28.37]Sir, um, hide.
[159:29.37]Hide.
[159:40.12]Uh, it was literally right at the door.
[159:44.16]Did you stop being so literal?
[159:46.58]It was literally.
[159:50.84]Alright, we gotta make sure skeleton of gelatin gets up here.
[159:54.75]Yeah, I took Pope's head out.
[160:00.07]Do you have the confidence?
[160:01.47]This thing is sliding and slippery.
[160:03.67]I can, I will hold it.
[160:06.34]If you push it and I hold it right in the middle.
[160:09.32]Let's see what happens.
[160:09.80]I think, no, let go of it.
[160:11.02]Let go of it.
[160:11.36]Is it good?
[160:12.44]I'm going to show you.
[160:13.16]I'm going to show you.
[160:15.64]You freaking guy.
[160:18.90]I'm going to show you.
[160:21.65]Vinny, out of my way.
[160:27.05]Everybody stand clear of the moving.
[160:29.19]Hey, hey, hands off.
[160:34.55]Hey, you're good.
[160:35.51]A little more right.
[160:40.51]Like a good.
[160:41.71]Yep.

[161:29.36]I can't, I can't hear anything!
[161:33.77]So when did I, how long, you've been dead for a long time.
[161:36.23]I was carrying around your head for a little bit.
[161:38.17]Yeah.
[161:40.93]Dude, look at the little characters on the bottom left.
[161:45.94]When I talk, your eyes go down.
[161:48.64]Did I cut out?
[161:50.18]Oh, yeah, I can see.
[161:53.69]That's funny.
[161:54.47]I know, I know.
[161:55.23]I just want to get this thing done.
[161:56.47]I feel like your little green character is this cannon.
[161:59.03]That's how we see all these characters.
[162:00.13]That's what I see in the life of myself.
[162:01.21]I'd rather be this than a person.
[162:02.01]They kind of have to get this thing, don't they?
[162:21.08]um it's 20 it's like 20. dude Ster Ster's crazy sir's gonna do it where's Vinny oh he's over here voices are telling me to kill the voices are telling me to kill again I don't want to talk about Vinny you can't no yeah I'm good oh my god dude you must hate this guy just the way my head moves
[162:52.69]It's coming, it comes.
[163:01.05]Wait, can you go all the way?
[163:02.25]Sorry if I hear your... I might hear your ear.
[163:07.84]Oh my god, oh my god.
[163:11.46]Oh my god, that's...
[163:24.76]I got alarm.
[163:26.46]Where's Jerma's corpse?
[163:39.25]That sounded like a fog alarm.
[163:40.57]Oh my god.
[163:42.03]Jerma is one with the planet again.
[163:43.49]Fell in the Mako.
[163:45.27]Okay.
[163:45.55]Jerma fell into the Mako energy.
[163:46.59]I don't think we're getting him.
[163:48.07]Yeah, well sometimes you just gotta make some noises.
[163:51.38]Gotta get it out.
[163:52.60]Use the map to find his body.
[163:54.76]He's literally not even on the map.
[163:56.90]Yeah, I'm long gone.
[163:58.08]They ain't finding me.
[163:58.76]No way.
[164:01.52]So they can't res you until next round?
[164:03.90]I kind of went all the way to the bottom.
[164:05.24]I didn't think you could actually fully disintegrate your body in this game, but Jerma has proven otherwise.
[164:10.54]If they res me, I'll find you.
[164:14.83]I'll find you.
[164:16.68]He is one with the skeleton and gelatin.
[164:19.87]We need to put this gelatin in.
[164:21.45]Yeah, put all that in.
[164:25.61]I tried to save you from that guy that was taking you and dragging you away, but I aggroed another enemy and it killed everybody.
[164:34.22]I wanted to do the voice.
[164:35.96]I wanted to have the voice thing happen and just kill me.
[164:38.94]That was so funny.
[164:39.88]That was a perfect camera view on you doing that.
[164:42.49]It was perfect.
[164:47.33]I guess that's the best we're gonna get.
[164:49.53]Yeah, yeah, that's good, that's good.
[164:51.95]I think I won't see it.
[164:52.94]Oh no, oh no, oh no!
[164:54.78]Oh my god, what did they do?
[164:56.34]It moved up!
[164:58.98]Good thing no one was here to see that.
[165:06.52]Did you not get, you didn't get rezzed from that?
[165:09.66]No, they're missing money.
[165:12.26]Ah.
[165:17.79]Wait.
[165:18.77]Someone from Linedown over there?
[165:26.00]Oh shit, he's in trouble.
[165:28.60]I think he sees us.
[165:29.08]Yo, stop at- Yo, Smod, get the guy to stop asking to FaceTime his child.
[165:32.96]I don't want to FaceTime his family, please stop asking.
[165:39.08]Sorry, I forgot to- I don't know how to mute it on here.
[165:41.52]Who's FaceTiming somebody's family?
[165:43.98]Yeah, this guy keeps asking me to FaceTime his child.
[165:48.97]How old is the kid?
[165:49.92]I don't know, I think he's... It's every day with this guy.
[165:54.28]It's like a baby?
[165:57.66]Like, oh, we're gonna FaceTime grandma and it's a baby.
[165:59.66]Yeah, I think it's a baby.
[166:08.47]How is this thing not killing him?
[166:10.09]This thing doesn't really care, honestly.
[166:13.17]Oh, I was watching.
[166:13.75]I was watching you, Ster.
[166:15.09]Uh-oh.
[166:15.29]I'm gonna die on that.
[166:17.21]Yeah, Vinny is just kind of slowly walking away from this thing.
[166:24.07]Where am I?
[166:30.69]Oh, dude.
[166:32.33]Where is he?
[166:32.65]Is this a weapon?
[166:33.47]Where did he go?
[166:34.21]Oh.
[166:35.39]God, he's gone.
[166:36.11]Oh, my God.
[166:36.69]What is that?
[166:38.55]Holy shit.
[166:39.71]That is a weirdo.
[166:40.51]That is a weirdo.
[166:48.37]Oh.
[166:49.77]I've been waiting for a moment like this with you.
[166:51.25]Oh my god.
[166:56.17]How much health do you have?
[167:05.12]How much health do you have?
[167:10.34]They shared some health, it seems.
[167:11.64]I'm just trying to be friendly.
[167:13.95]I appreciate it, but I thought you only had one.
[167:20.94]There's a vase.
[167:25.26]Am I loud?
[167:26.40]I had an extraction locator and that shit's gone.
[167:32.75]Lost down a pit.
[167:35.99]I'm surprised it didn't break.
[167:40.13]I just dropped it.
[167:47.10]I think you're about to be spawned, maybe?
[167:51.43]Yeah, there he goes.
[167:53.27]I didn't even say bye to him!
[168:00.05]It's totally gone.
[168:01.49]It fell into, like, a pit.
[168:05.93]You're now louder than usual, Poke.
[168:09.60]I can hear myself.
[168:11.68]You have your chair squeaking or something, too?
[168:16.74]Like, I haven't wanted to mention it.
[168:22.76]Guess I'll just sit here.
[168:27.08]Something just blew up.
[168:28.74]I think the alien blew up.
[168:31.62]Oh, maybe.
[168:32.32]I had a mine.
[168:34.74]What is that?
[168:35.88]Something.
[168:37.96]They're losing money.
[168:39.11]Look at this.
[168:40.05]What happened?
[168:42.07]He doesn't want to talk to us about it.
[168:46.09]Where's the $22,000 computer?
[168:48.19]Oh my God, that's right.
[168:48.99]I think it was upstairs.
[168:50.03]He really ran away.
[168:53.32]Oh, money.
[169:01.40]I love switching between the POVs because you end up just... Where's our... Oh, here we go.
[169:07.27]Not heavy.
[169:08.15]You know, like I've been... Games like this are fun because you know you're being watched, but you don't know you're being watched.
[169:14.27]No, I think I just got to be really close to this mic
[169:17.46]Alright, we got to find that computer metal talk to the know where it is on the map Fuck Oh
[169:47.45]I'm gonna say so lonely.
[169:53.66]Are you- NO!
[169:54.82]What?
[169:56.40]Did you not see- No!
[169:59.06]It's Nancy!
[170:00.74]No!
[170:02.40]No!
[170:04.30]No, I was trying to do like a shortcut back!
[170:08.54]Oh, man.
[170:09.34]I was typing, and I had the aerial view of your head, and then you just started falling.
[170:16.50]Hey, but what's been happening?
[170:18.44]We can talk again.
[170:19.44]Yo, yo.
[170:20.02]What's up, man?
[170:21.27]Sir?
[170:23.57]Chillin', bad mic days, just stressing me out.
[170:27.91]I think the mic sounds good.
[170:29.89]Oh, thank you.
[170:31.29]What kind of mic is it?
[170:31.91]It's a new mic.
[170:34.47]It's a new mic.
[170:35.91]It's a mic.
[170:38.53]What have you been up to?
[170:39.47]Playing the Dracula game?
[170:41.41]Yeah, they're so much fun.
[170:44.25]Yeah, I've been watching.
[170:46.15]You got to get in on the Dracula.
[170:47.43]I don't know what's going on in that game, but it's interesting.
[170:49.88]Apparently there's five of them.
[170:52.68]I guess there's at least five of those games.
[170:55.06]I don't know how.
[170:59.24]I don't want to spoil it for you, but... Well, no.
[171:03.92]I mean, when you go through the whole series, you'll see, right?
[171:06.54]You're going to play the whole thing, right?
[171:07.78]I see you.
[171:08.60]Yeah, I'll do it.
[171:09.20]That was good, though.
[171:11.10]That was a good spot.
[171:13.38]Surprisingly good spot.
[171:14.58]How bad is the computer?
[171:16.62]It's still enough.
[171:20.08]Dude, you know, I want to go.
[171:21.24]I don't think these professional mics with the mic stands and boom.
[171:26.81]We should go around this way.
[171:28.85]I'm so done with this.
[171:30.61]I just want a mic on my face.
[171:32.57]It'll connect this way.
[171:35.09]I realize this is better.
[171:35.97]Okay, Buster.
[171:38.57]I want one of those.
[171:39.15]I bought this mic for music.
[171:42.66]For music stuff.
[171:44.02]Is it a lav mic or is it just a stand mic?
[171:48.08]Uh, a stem, like a pro mic.
[171:50.67]It's like the shirt.
[171:51.99]Careful.
[171:53.93]Okay.
[171:54.61]I just want like a good lav mic.
[171:56.13]I move around too much, but I end up putting the mic all the time.
[171:58.29]Because that big bar goes in front of your face.
[172:00.83]I just, I'm not cut out for a mic in my face.
[172:03.30]You take care of that.
[172:06.88]You should get like, yeah, just use like a headset mic.
[172:11.48]Yeah.
[172:11.92]We should all just get headset mics.
[172:13.51]I feel like it's more authentic in a way, isn't it?
[172:20.30]Yeah.
[172:20.70]The crunchiness would be more authentic, especially in a game like this.
[172:25.69]Oh my god, that's 2,000 worth of damage?
[172:29.50]We're all podcasting right now.
[172:31.24]Let go.
[172:31.92]Yeah, this is not gaming.
[172:34.57]This is a cast.
[172:35.91]We should be with crusty mics.
[172:37.77]This should be fucking dogs barking in the background.
[172:40.81]Someone eating chips.
[172:44.31]Someone eating chips.
[172:45.88]Someone's phone watching TikTok.
[172:48.00]Every so often you just hear a loud cough that peaks the mic to plus 500 dB.
[172:55.24]Fire alarm.
[173:07.10]Actually, I think we're gonna pull this off.
[173:11.14]Could somebody, like, pay the electric bill in this place?
[173:17.07]It was that dude that we just saw.
[173:19.25]He's not paying shit.
[173:32.40]Any secrets in here?
[173:38.06]When you can't webcam mics, yeah.
[173:41.44]We should all just use it.
[173:46.38]I think that'd be kind of fun, though.
[173:47.66]Just have everybody have just shit stuff.
[173:49.68]Oh, there's a cat that's lying here.
[173:54.83]Who can have the shittiest mic next time?
[173:57.30]That's actually a fun idea.
[173:59.18]Who can have the worst mic next time?
[174:02.54]Yeah, but still understandable.
[174:06.81]I'm getting that.
[174:07.35]You know that white stand mic that was on old Macintosh computers back in the early 90s?
[174:15.05]Oh, come on.
[174:15.45]What about the Logitech?
[174:16.59]Yeah, that's the one.
[174:18.58]It's the little white stick.
[174:20.38]The webcam mic is the best one.
[174:26.08]But I feel like it's just so overdone now.
[174:28.92]You know, the C920, like... You just become a certain volume, it just dies.
[174:35.42]Dude, what is going on with... Why has no webcam technology gone past 2006?
[174:44.05]I feel like the C920 came out and then just, that was it.
[174:46.45]It was like, we don't... And then, like, they made more that really weren't even that much better.
[174:52.96]Oh, this thing, it's not surviving.
[174:54.28]Have you seen the new ones?
[174:55.38]Are they any good?
[174:56.28]They're expensive as hell.
[174:57.52]I don't know.
[174:58.18]I tried, like, 200 bucks, but it was okay.
[175:04.12]God damn it.
[175:05.72]I just feel like they made 100 million of these things, and they're just going to sell them to be all gone.
[175:10.65]I think it's easier without it.
[175:12.65]Okay.
[175:15.91]I can drag it.
[175:17.97]Fine.
[175:18.33]1k.
[175:25.35]This was... How much is this worth now?
[175:29.47]Oh god.
[175:30.57]Oh, that's not good.
[175:33.83]Oh.
[175:35.31]You just ran away.
[175:38.81]I should've.
[175:41.33]Are these screwed?
[175:41.78]I don't know if there's enough stuff on this map.
[175:45.12]I think they're screwed here.
[175:45.94]I don't know either.
[175:46.42]They need 10k bucks more.
[175:48.24]Yeah, I think that was probably the only way it was gonna happen.
[175:52.00]If there's not enough, do we just jump?
[175:54.81]That was you?
[175:59.23]How do we kill the duck?
[176:01.71]Do I just put him in the zone here?
[176:03.47]They need to drop a gun on his head.
[176:06.42]They have to crush him with an anvil.
[176:07.98]Use their head to kill it.
[176:10.02]Gun.
[176:10.30]Alright.
[176:16.64]I think it's over, man.
[176:18.94]Oh, Squidward.
[176:24.72]I just thought you said Squidward because you thought it was a quirky word to say out loud, but no, I forgot we were calling that thing Squidward.
[176:31.32]20k, computer.
[176:34.84]20k, computer right here.
[176:38.11]Oh shit.
[176:40.69]Ah, Squidward upstairs.
[176:48.72]He's just chilling with the duck now.
[176:49.92]This is interesting.
[176:51.44]Yeah.
[176:58.19]The duck really sounds like Ster's duck sound.
[177:01.15]It does.
[177:03.87]Uh, where is the cart?
[177:06.36]Maybe we safety cart this one.
[177:10.80]Right there.
[177:11.16]Okay, yeah, I can tip it in.
[177:14.80]Maybe you can't kill it, maybe it just has to... follow you around until somebody accidentally touches it and that's all it is.
[177:21.68]I don't think that's gonna work.
[177:26.08]Too weird of an angle.
[177:26.68]What does that thing work?
[177:28.51]um try to get it 20k you know let's get it on okay okay okay okay okay that was teamwork and that's power uh weapons from the store can do it you probably shoot it oh nice so you got this I hate this I really and I love ducks I hate this duck I love this dog don't you dare
[177:54.83]Okay, we're going straight through this door then to the right.
[177:57.09]That's, uh, I don't feel comfortable doing this.
[177:59.37]I'll check.
[178:00.65]I'll check.
[178:04.17]All clear, all clear, all clear.
[178:06.17]I can't see shit because I'm crouched.
[178:10.13]Stop, stop, stop.
[178:11.75]Okay, slow turn, slow turn towards me.
[178:14.10]Getting a water.
[178:15.96]Yep.
[178:16.90]Straight.
[178:18.64]Turning, turning.
[178:22.34]They actually might do this, but I think they're going to get it.
[178:24.04]Perfectly straight.
[178:25.82]Watch the door edge.
[178:27.17]Okay.
[178:27.85]We're going up these stairs, Buster.
[178:29.61]You can do it.
[178:31.01]That's a lot coming from Vinny.
[178:32.25]He usually loves ducks.
[178:33.49]He's all about ducks.
[178:34.39]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[178:39.03]Be careful.
[178:39.51]Okay.
[178:41.65]This spot up here, there might not be enough room.
[178:43.70]Yeah, they're going to get caught.
[178:45.60]They're going to get caught right here.
[178:46.46]Okay.
[178:49.87]Oh, good.
[178:50.45]That was a good play by sir.
[178:51.47]I want to tip this up so it doesn't get crushed because if this destroys, we're done.
[178:55.23]Do you want to use the cart or no?
[178:59.89]No, just like help it stand up.
[179:02.21]I have the top.
[179:05.25]This way, come this way.
[179:08.78]Let's rotate it nice and vertical.
[179:10.52]Okay.
[179:11.76]Okay, now I'm going to grab the top and we're just going to walk it on.
[179:22.85]Hey, I think they did it.
[179:26.12]Oh, boy.
[179:27.16]Wow, with one... We're not done yet.
[179:29.02]With just one thing.
[179:32.96]Very nice.
[179:33.16]Alright, we got Poke with us, but we got to get back to the extraction point.
[179:37.62]Or the truck or whatever.
[179:38.64]Alone again.
[179:39.12]Hi, Poke.
[179:40.26]Alright, we got to go.
[179:41.75]I died right here.
[179:43.85]What got you?
[179:44.67]I was trying to do like a shortcut jump, but I just died.
[179:47.83]Squidward.
[179:50.35]Squidward.
[179:51.74]I guess I can give commentary.
[179:52.92]What does he do?
[179:54.10]I don't know.
[179:54.48]He also has a man with him.
[179:56.52]Oh, I can do the red-green thing.
[179:58.00]Oh, I can do the red-green thing.
[179:59.16]Okay, cool.
[179:59.62]I'm stuck.
[180:00.23]I'm actually stuck.
[180:01.79]Oh, I'm out.
[180:04.85]Well, looks like Vinny was down here trying to find the monster, and well, it looks like the monster grabbed him, well, didn't grab him just quite yet.
[180:11.67]The other two are kind of upstairs, looks like he's hiding, and I don't know, doesn't want to get killed, I understand that.
[180:16.34]It looks like the duck is not there, but he's got a different duck.
[180:22.02]And these two swords, I'd be careful if I were you.
[180:24.86]I'm not there, obviously, but I would not want to have any issue, you know.
[180:31.11]Now we have Vinny here going to this truck and it seems like he's out of heat up there.
[180:34.71]That's pretty good.
[180:37.91]Oh, a little extra throw up there.
[180:40.43]I probably had a little too much tacos earlier at launch.
[180:43.66]No.
[180:44.70]You died?
[180:45.08]What?
[180:45.24]You died?
[180:45.98]What happened?
[180:47.78]Guys.
[180:49.72]Guys.
[180:50.78]Dude, no.
[180:51.50]You can't tell anyone.
[180:53.34]I'm glad to have you back.
[180:54.62]You gotta tell them Squidward killed you.
[180:56.90]Dude, no way.
[180:58.28]Squidward killed me.
[181:00.37]Oh, what is it?
[181:01.89]What do you do for a move?
[181:04.01]Oh, God.
[181:04.57]I don't know.
[181:05.63]You good?
[181:06.79]Yep.
[181:07.73]Fine.
[181:08.17]Thank you.
[181:08.69]Alright.
[181:10.89]Time to go.
[181:12.27]Poke is out there.
[181:14.12]Oh, this is back here.
[181:15.76]I brought it back.
[181:17.38]I literally just, I died to the ball.
[181:19.72]Whatever.
[181:20.82]I'm not going to lie.
[181:21.50]I died to the balls.
[181:22.16]That actually did damage.
[181:23.86]It's easy to die to anything in this game, honestly.
[181:26.70]I'm making this terrible.
[181:28.16]It'll be worth it.
[181:28.95]It'll get health if he comes back.
[181:31.89]Oh my god.
[181:32.99]Get it!
[181:34.67]Get it!
[181:34.99]Get it!
[181:35.27]Get it!
[181:35.97]Oh, you can kill it.
[181:40.35]It's dead.
[181:41.99]Oh, when you kill monsters, you get their essence.
[181:43.85]I definitely didn't break one before.
[181:45.35]Watch out for that duck.
[181:46.34]I saw a few of those.
[181:47.08]I didn't know what they were.
[181:48.16]Kill the duck!
[181:49.37]Okay, they're worth money.
[181:50.87]They are.
[181:51.75]They fucking break immediately.
[181:53.39]They're both dead.
[181:54.50]Go, go, go, go, go.
[181:57.18]He's dead.
[181:57.54]Watch that.
[181:58.52]How do they know we're dead, dude?
[181:59.98]They're cheating.
[182:00.54]Oh yeah, they're mitigating.
[182:03.58]Oh my god.
[182:04.12]This is fucked.
[182:05.40]This is fucked.
[182:06.74]This is fucked.
[182:09.06]I don't know how we did that.
[182:12.74]Jeremy, it feels like it's been two years since I've heard your voice.
[182:16.39]I think I was dead for 45 minutes.
[182:19.79]Jesus.
[182:20.77]Yeah, I was following you guys, and then... But, man, thank you guys so much.
[182:27.65]Oni did it.
[182:28.73]We did it.
[182:29.43]Oh, by the way, nice metagaming, by the way, sir.
[182:32.27]Wait, what metagaming?
[182:35.12]You were like, oh, no, they're dead.
[182:36.28]Wow, you knew we were dead.
[182:37.36]It was Vinny.
[182:38.04]Vinny said that.
[182:39.34]Stay right there for a second.
[182:40.66]Just hold on.
[182:41.12]Dude, I don't know why I did that.
[182:42.36]Vinny metagaming with your bullshit, I heard.
[182:45.24]I think he just, like... Someone told me it's their fault.
[182:51.92]It's always you.
[182:52.84]It's not my fault.
[182:54.24]Okay.
[182:55.67]If I were to... If I were to get bit by a bug right now in the room, I would probably think you sent it somehow.
[183:03.81]If a mosquito bit me in the leg, I'd be like... What's up with that?
[183:10.41]I'll throw you in there.
[183:12.14]Okay, guy who shot me in the forehead in this very room.
[183:16.28]Tell us what's in there, buddy.
[183:17.72]You can just jump.
[183:20.00]Oh shit, I'm so sorry.
[183:22.40]Ow.
[183:23.61]I'm not as strong as I used to be.
[183:28.19]There's nothing up here.
[183:29.31]Oh wait, now there's something.
[183:30.17]There's just a human grenade. 63,000?
[183:41.39]Just like the Roblox jumpscare?
[183:43.03]Okay, the Roblox jumpscare, Ster, if you remember that, you made a bunch of funny sounds and then said, hey, turn me up.
[183:50.41]Oh, because I made funny sounds.
[183:52.79]No, you said, turn me up.
[183:53.86]Hey, turn me up.
[183:54.42]Turn me up.
[183:54.76]Listen to this.
[183:55.78]And then it was like... He's been sending me messages the whole time he was dead in my Discord that are like, stop talking.
[184:02.60]It's enough.
[184:03.72]We get it, dude.
[184:04.76]It's like, I don't even know what he's on about.
[184:06.30]I was there.
[184:08.58]Unless you were Stunlocked.
[184:10.85]Packing the duck will enrage it.
[184:14.67]I was scared.
[184:15.43]I was there.
[184:16.97]Alright, I need some stamina.
[184:18.55]How much stamina do you guys have?
[184:19.59]Like 70?
[184:22.23]I got 40 stamina.
[184:25.99]Buy all the stamina upgrades.
[184:27.75]I need at least two.
[184:28.47]I still do not understand what these energy crystals do.
[184:39.53]Has anyone?
[184:40.03]What about strength?
[184:43.41]17,000.
[184:48.85]I think strength is like the best upgrade in here.
[184:53.55]Wait, Ster, look.
[184:54.19]I think it's like recharging.
[184:59.76]Oh my god, you saw that?
[185:00.40]I did.
[185:03.55]I think it's for recharging... I think the things that have batteries?
[185:09.25]Just slip on that?
[185:10.57]It's like trying to do an ollie for the first time and you sprain your fucking ankle.
[185:18.79]Oh my god.
[185:21.61]Holy shit, Lois!
[185:26.10]Do we have anything else we want?
[185:27.90]Look, I can get in here without you guys help.
[185:29.94]Look, look, look.
[185:31.02]You gonna buy a mine, unless we are buying anything else?
[185:33.80]I can do this.
[185:35.02]Wait, we only have one health?
[185:36.60]Oh, that's not great.
[185:37.36]Shit.
[185:38.82]Ster, you try.
[185:39.24]We're gonna need more than one health.
[185:44.13]I'm telling you, it does work.
[185:45.75]You can get inside of it?
[185:48.15]I think you stand on it first, and then... ...jump, like Half-Life type.
[186:01.12]Oh, that was actually kind of cool.
[186:07.73]Okay, so what do we have here?
[186:13.38]A bunch of upgrades, some health, not a ton, but a decent amount.
[186:19.00]Grenade, yep, okay.
[186:20.40]You ready?
[186:20.96]I'm going to buy all this crap.
[186:21.80]I think we're good.
[186:22.74]Alright.
[186:27.42]I mean, we have survived for, like, this is a really good run.
[186:32.47]So, I mean, I don't know if there's an ending to this game, but we have a chance.
[186:36.23]Yeah, surprisingly, this has been going very well.
[186:43.38]I have one HP, by the way.
[186:45.02]I don't know.
[186:46.56]Yeah, sorry you didn't get to play last round.
[186:48.94]We got more health, so we'll get you some.
[186:54.57]Has there ever been an ending to any of these types of games?
[186:58.29]I don't think so.
[186:59.88]Zort?
[187:00.28]What is the name of that game?
[187:01.42]It's a lork?
[187:03.16]Zordberg.
[187:08.80]I hope nobody heard that.
[187:09.62]I hope only my community heard that because it was embarrassing.
[187:12.82]I didn't hear anything.
[187:13.56]What are you talking about?
[187:14.40]Thank God.
[187:14.82]Okay, Poke or Jerma, grab that 100.
[187:24.52]And, uh, let's heal up, Poke.
[187:27.50]I am 40.
[187:27.84]For the record.
[187:30.82]Come over here.
[187:32.66]Yeah, do it.
[187:33.73]I'll get you one more, Poke.
[187:35.29]Oh, fuck!
[187:36.73]Are you dead?
[187:37.51]Oh, that's a broken finger.
[187:38.45]That's a broken finger.
[187:39.93]Broken fucking finger.
[187:40.75]I'm so sorry.
[187:42.49]Oh, uh, I think I have to put it on ice or something.
[187:45.13]What do you have for health?
[187:53.50]I can.
[187:53.68]I can give poke two.
[188:16.29]How did you just get there?
[188:17.07]How did you get to go?
[188:19.63]Alright, let's all do that.
[188:21.59]Just look up.
[188:23.05]Just spam I, look up.
[188:28.66]We have to harmonize.
[188:29.84]One of us go low, one of us go high.
[188:31.60]Everyone has to start low, then you look up.
[188:33.30]Oh, God.
[188:35.20]Harmonize.
[188:36.18]I'll go really low.
[188:37.68]Somebody go really high.
[188:39.30]Ster it.
[188:40.54]Okay, who wants to go really high?
[188:41.70]Oh, you're right.
[188:42.12]Okay, that's a good idea.
[188:43.14]I'm gonna do my impression of a plane while you guys do that, alright?
[188:45.77]Here we go.
[188:46.87]So you're gonna- okay.
[188:48.17]So I'll go low, Ster you go medium, and then Poke you go high.
[188:51.89]And I'll be the plane.
[188:52.81]Alright.
[188:53.01]Alright, ready?
[188:53.65]Who's toting?
[188:54.59]Three, two, one.
[189:01.90]Uh, when's the food gonna be done?
[189:03.02]Cause that's a fuckin' microwave.
[189:09.63]I thought I was ascending to heaven.
[189:11.03]Yeah, does it work?
[189:14.35]Yeah.
[189:14.57]What is he saying?
[189:15.25]I can make that a song.
[189:40.18]Alright, where's my stamina?
[189:42.80]I need at least one of those.
[189:43.62]Shiny.
[189:43.86]So succulent.
[189:44.26]So round.
[189:44.46]So full of power.
[189:45.52]So full of destruction.
[189:46.48]So tempting.
[190:07.81]These levels are getting harder there's more like holes in the ground
[190:39.04]It's a bunch of doors.
[190:39.88]Please take this from me.
[190:40.54]It's a bunch of doors.
[190:41.54]Ster, take it from me.
[190:42.40]What are you doing?
[190:43.24]I don't want to use this.
[190:46.40]Poke.
[190:47.04]Take this from me.
[190:48.72]Ster.
[190:49.12]Someone's dead.
[190:50.24]Someone's dead.
[190:51.10]Vinny might be dead.
[190:51.75]This is Vinny's head.
[190:52.23]Take this from me because you need to use it because I will... Put it on here.
[190:55.29]On here.
[190:56.31]Give it to me.
[190:57.93]Oh.
[190:58.33]Just drop it.
[190:59.03]I can't press E. One, two, three.
[191:02.55]You press one, two, three.
[191:03.65]You can't walk at me with a grenade.
[191:05.63]I want him to have it because I can't use it.
[191:08.61]Watch out for the hole.
[191:09.65]Vinny's dead already.
[191:10.61]I think one of the skeletons got him.
[191:13.27]We got a big grand piano here.
[191:16.03]Let's get the piano.
[191:17.95]It's right there.
[191:18.79]It's locked.
[191:19.53]Let's find the exit.
[191:20.57]Let's find the exit.
[191:22.68]Oh, it is right here.
[191:24.22]That's a later one.
[191:25.08]Do we have to go back?
[191:26.46]Oh, we have to do a starter one first.
[191:27.74]Yeah.
[191:29.42]We can keep this piano here and then keep the piano for this one.
[191:33.85]Yeah, let's do that.
[191:34.53]That's smart.
[191:35.11]That's... Oh, shit!
[191:36.95]Head.
[191:37.79]Give head.
[191:38.30]We're gonna call him out for that.
[191:42.84]What the fuck just happened?
[191:44.56]Oh, my God.
[191:48.92]No!
[191:49.40]It's the same thing after all of us.
[191:51.94]That's hard to see.
[191:52.80]I got bumped.
[191:55.16]Well... Looks like Poke is the one who's gonna save us.
[191:59.05]Ah!
[192:04.97]Wait, was that the girl that was screaming before that you heard, Ster?
[192:10.11]That's weird.
[192:11.39]I thought it was you.
[192:12.91]No, it must have been Poke.
[192:14.99]Ah, you got him with that one.
[192:16.43]I said bitch.
[192:18.45]I said bitch.
[192:20.39]I said bitch.
[192:23.01]I said bitch.
[192:25.26]Oh, he does listen to sound.
[192:26.48]He's not happy about that.
[192:35.29]How is there like two tones of fart?
[192:38.25]How does he do two at once?
[192:39.33]That's weird.
[192:43.88]Are we going to have a duck off?
[192:51.10]I can, yeah, I can do, actually I was joking around because I can do two ducks at the same time.
[192:55.18]So.
[192:58.18]You did that right when you opened his mouth.
[193:03.68]Yeah.
[193:04.42]What the hell?!
[193:05.82]What the hell?!
[193:06.22]That didn't last very long.
[193:07.90]Dude, no!
[193:08.98]No!
[193:09.80]No!
[193:10.06]What?!
[193:10.60]Dude, what?!
[193:12.69]Why?!
[193:13.17]Uh, well... I thought I was safe!
[193:18.67]No, I think they're attracted to the noise you make.
[193:24.71]You talked a lot of shit.
[193:26.24]Wait, so it hurt me?
[193:31.64]Maybe.
[193:32.88]Ow!
[193:37.98]Did you just... Did I just kill you?
[193:39.86]Holy shit.
[193:40.80]I gotta use my technique that I use on everything.
[193:44.42]Holy shit, I just killed... Holy shit.
[193:48.45]You're next.
[193:50.85]It's over for you.
[193:58.40]It's over for you.
[193:59.16]It's over for you.
[194:02.70]It's over for you.
[194:10.52]Oh my goodness.
[194:11.26]Oh my God.
[194:12.36]What happened to you?
[194:23.61]Come on.
[194:27.15]You think that's going to work?
[194:41.69]And I get all the jewels to myself.
[194:45.19]You cheated.
[194:45.77]Well, I didn't want to win that prize.
[194:55.26]I'll take it.
[194:55.80]I'll be king of the losers.
[194:56.84]That's fine.
[195:01.56]Excellent.

[195:43.66]I'm gonna play Monster Hunter, catch you guys up on Boss 2.
[195:51.20]Anything else?
[195:52.42]Dude, monsters.
[195:56.21]It's up to you, Jerma.
[195:57.59]I'll leave it in your hands.
[195:59.43]Wow, that was a really sly way to say no.
[196:04.46]No, I mean, I'm good.
[196:05.34]I usually stream another two hours.
[196:06.82]I stream until like 1.30 Eastern.
[196:12.20]I have to get... The last thing I did was... The boss after the second... I think it was the... It's like a big bear thing.
[196:21.99]Like a big blue bear.
[196:23.51]After the... I don't want to spoil the whole game for people.
[196:27.79]A big blue bear.
[196:29.57]We might be similar.
[196:30.67]I might be just behind you in Monster.
[196:33.73]archivald no it was after the fire um eight tendrilled uh monster so Jerma I'm up to that bear then that's where I'm at so I have to do that bear and then you and I are caught up okay yeah we can help you or I don't know whatever I mean I'm up for it sure
[196:59.79]Can we take a break though?
[197:03.53]I need to pee.
[197:05.52]Yeah.
[197:07.06]Alright, I'm back.
[197:11.82]Huh?
[197:13.80]Alright, so I guess we're... That is so bright.
[197:21.89]It's been so dark for three and a half hours.
[197:23.55]That was just a flashbang.
[197:28.05]I think we're going to do a little bit of Monster Hunter maybe, and I want to play Monster Hunter more.
[197:32.43]I'm probably going to try to play it this weekend too.
[197:44.84]That was really fun though.
[197:45.56]That was cool.
[197:51.74]Is he going to smoke a bowl?
[197:53.40]No.
[197:56.18]But yeah, I'll take a quick break.
[198:01.74]I'll probably manually just... I'm probably just going to run three minutes of ads.
[198:05.97]Just because I didn't get rid of some pre-rolls for a little while.
[198:09.47]I haven't run any today, so... Sorry if you've been getting ads when you didn't know and you didn't want to.
[198:18.17]You can't really run three minute ad breaks every hour when you're doing co-op stuff like this.
[198:23.74]I wouldn't want to do that, so...
[198:26.94]My pre-roll isn't that bad.
[198:29.66]Yeah, but especially when you're jumping around to different streams.
[198:32.26]I can imagine that might be kind of annoying if you're opening the four streams that are going.
[198:37.64]But I'll be right back.
[198:41.31]See you guys in a few minutes and then we'll play some, I guess, some Monster Hunter maybe?
[198:44.55]I don't know.
[198:46.87]Here we go.
