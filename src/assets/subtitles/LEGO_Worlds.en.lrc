[00:35.13]Wait, what?
[01:29.01]Hi.
[01:30.85]I'm currently trying to get this to work.
[01:32.89]Lego Worlds seems to have a lot of video issues initially, but... Hi.
[01:38.93]Good evening.
[01:40.68]This is going to be the fairly short stream before PAX East.
[01:45.80]I'm going to PAX East.
[01:47.28]I'm going there tomorrow morning.
[01:50.30]So I got a lot of stuff to get ready.
[01:52.42]There's a lot of things going on.
[01:54.43]So this is going to be not that long of a stream.
[01:57.19]If you're going to PAX East, please say hello if you see me.
[01:59.95]I'll be there all three days.
[02:01.77]All three days and nights.
[02:04.53]And yeah.
[02:06.23]Yeah, that's how we roll.
[02:08.85]So give me one minute while I continue to get this set up, I'll be right back.
[02:19.90]Wait, what?
[02:29.90]Wait, what?
[02:41.64]Alright, let me just, let's just give this a try.
[02:43.12]I'm gonna switch this over for a second.
[02:45.84]I wonder if it's gonna get capped.
[02:48.70]Hope so.
[02:49.31]Well, there it is.
[02:53.27]And... Do we have liftoff?
[02:56.69]We might.
[02:57.23]We might have liftoff.
[03:00.15]Do we have liftoff?
[03:01.91]Hey, we have liftoff.
[03:03.91]Okay.
[03:04.65]So, how loud is this right now?
[03:06.33]Do you guys want, like, the royalty-free music?
[03:10.60]Graphic settings, whatever.
[03:11.64]Who cares?
[03:12.00]Effect settings.
[03:14.34]Motion blur off.
[03:16.50]Ambient occlusion.
[03:17.32]Just no motion blur, whatever.
[03:21.64]Medium.
[03:21.96]Let's do high, right?
[03:23.68]Very high.
[03:24.16]We're going to stay on high.
[03:28.47]New game, right?
[03:30.61]It's too quiet?
[03:34.61]It's a little quiet here.
[03:35.61]Hold on.
[03:35.87]Let me do this.
[03:40.25]Do a voiceover?
[03:42.27]Yeah, I have no idea what this game is.
[03:44.64]Not a single clue.
[03:47.04]It came out of Early Access, and I'm just kind of curious.
[03:53.92]Now I can't see the chat.
[03:55.92]Because running this game in a window in Borderless does not seem to work with two monitors.
[04:02.17]But, whatever, let's just get it started, right?
[04:05.05]Okay, well, I can see the chat now, I just... What just happened?
[04:10.33]Dude, I alt-tabbed and it made it 800x600.
[04:11.65]What the fuck?
[04:14.39]Wasn't this in fucking early access?
[04:17.45]Like, it came out of early access.
[04:19.39]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[04:20.39]Alright.
[04:24.83]Let's go.
[04:26.75]Back.
[04:27.61]New game.
[04:29.01]Slot 1 is empty.
[04:29.89]Is this an MMO?
[04:31.45]This is an MMO, right?
[04:33.77]Confirm.
[04:34.39]Yeah.
[04:34.91]Saving game.
[04:35.37]Let's go.
[04:37.11]Autosave will now use game one.
[04:38.81]Dr. Wily.
[04:39.81]And make sure you watch out for Dr. Wily.
[04:42.05]Okay, uh, welcome to LEGO Worlds.
[04:47.21]What is that?
[04:49.34]Did I build this?
[04:53.18]I think I made this.
[04:54.76]Settings.
[04:55.24]No, I don't need settings yet.
[04:58.12]Uh, add on content back to join game.
[05:01.52]Play game.
[05:03.66]Just join... No, that's like... That didn't do it.

[05:10.31]Start new game online.
[05:11.95]This game has like a story?
[05:20.98]Well, let's watch the story.
[05:22.52]What?
[05:29.14]Watch out, fucking R2-D2 is floating around.
[05:32.87]Oh shit, R2-D2 lost his brain.
[05:34.69]His brain is a little guy.
[05:35.89]What's happening?
[05:45.56]What the...

[06:18.57]Um...
[06:21.99]Okay.
[06:23.03]You're dead, by the way.
[06:24.17]This will kill you.
[06:25.41]If you're ever in space, don't do this.
[06:27.27]That's not him happy.
[06:28.13]That's him fucking gasping for air because he's dying.
[06:31.45]The smile just happens to be how his face looks normal.
[06:35.94]No beards, really?
[06:41.64]There's only two hands.
[06:45.52]Wait, what?
[06:48.42]There's nothing here.
[06:49.44]Do I have to unlock these things?
[06:57.25]We're gonna look like this apparently I don't I wish I had I can have a cape whatever Really oh you can move around Dude this is just like the gift of flight pirate playground I
[07:18.41]That would kill you.
[07:19.95]Your first LEGO world.
[07:22.61]So much to discover.
[07:24.37]Look at this.
[07:24.89]But your rocket took a beating.
[07:27.13]A few gold bricks should fix it right up.
[07:30.08]I need some gold bricks.
[07:32.14]See, this is the tutorial I was talking about.
[07:34.02]Take a look at the bottom.
[07:36.68]Everything.
[07:37.12]Move, hold.
[07:38.30]You can move and hold.
[07:39.14]W, A, S, D. Jump is space.
[07:40.84]Action is left click.
[07:43.16]Or F, right.
[07:45.19]Okay, cool.
[07:47.67]Ability is E. Look, a meteorite.
[07:50.31]Items, the number pad.
[07:52.35]Look around.
[07:52.93]Okay.
[07:53.77]I know how to play the whole game now.
[07:59.67]Okay, what is this?
[08:02.59]I need three gold bars.
[08:06.15]I just started laughing.
[08:07.39]The graphics are... Wow, what a great graphic game.
[08:09.67]You know what I mean?
[08:12.79]Okay.
[08:13.61]Here's what I needed.
[08:14.15]I guess the discovery tool.
[08:20.39]Alright, so now I unlock the discovery tool.
[08:22.93]The discovery tool.
[08:24.19]Shush!
[08:25.14]Use the powerful discovery tool to scan and collect new models, outfits, creatures, and vehicles.
[08:31.68]Once they're in your collection, you can use the tool to summon things into your worlds.
[08:36.87]Place them precisely where you want them, or fire them into the sky with wild abandon.
[08:43.23]Getting to grips with the discovery tool is the first step on your journey to become a master builder.
[08:51.56]Alright, so I have the discovery tool.
[08:55.24]So how do I use the discovery tool?
[09:05.86]Tab, right?
[09:07.61]There it is.
[09:09.11]Tab or to do this one?
[09:12.51]No discoveries made.
[09:16.63]Hold on.
[09:17.09]I've got to discover this bird.
[09:21.37]Come here.
[09:23.56]Come here.
[09:23.90]I'm trying to discover you.
[09:26.50]Discovered him.
[09:28.76]Nice.
[09:29.18]Okay, so I have 1,200 seagulls.
[10:01.71]Maybe I shouldn't have... I'm not going to ever be able to have a picnic.
[10:08.29]Okay, well, that's fine.
[10:11.18]How do I get off of this now?
[10:16.98]How do I turn off the discovery machine?
[10:19.33]No, I want to discover other animals.
[10:22.65]That's fine.
[10:23.05]Alright, let's go over here.
[10:23.79]We gotta go this way.
[10:28.22]R is rotate.
[10:29.22]There's a person.
[10:31.34]Can I discover the person?
[10:33.56]Pirate lady.
[10:34.06]Cannot discover yet.
[10:36.42]Why not?
[10:39.46]Put this away.
[10:44.79]What the fuck is going on here?
[10:47.85]I want to put this away.
[10:50.13]Navigate menus with the mouse.
[10:51.83]Put away a C. What do you want me to do?
[10:57.24]Some pigs and chickens is what I need right here.
[10:59.64]Savvy.
[11:00.48]Alright, let's go discover some pigs.
[11:07.80]Discover the chicken.
[11:10.41]Okay.
[11:13.55]It's this easy, right?
[11:14.93]Yeah.
[11:16.63]And then we have to hit tab and we have to shoot the chicken in here.
[11:22.33]Imagine the world would be such a different place if you could just discover an animal and then shoot it into somebody's backyard.
[11:29.38]Alright, so that's three out of five.
[11:30.46]Alright, now I'm just going to discover this.
[11:37.13]And put that out there.
[11:39.01]I don't have enough.
[11:42.69]I don't have enough bottle caps.
[11:45.15]How do I get more bottle caps?
[11:54.35]Well, I know, I know it's tab, but I can't, I don't have enough.
[11:58.41]Did I make too many?
[11:59.51]Unlock.
[12:02.59]Shit, did I, like, spend too much money on the seagulls?
[12:09.74]Okay, I guess I shouldn't have done the seagull bit.
[12:13.36]Alright, like, how do I get the fuck out of, like, this menu without having to click that button?
[12:20.15]Let's go smash, let's go find, alright, just grab a...
[12:23.81]Whatever this is.
[12:25.39]No, I didn't want to do that.
[12:26.37]Okay.
[12:28.95]Discover this.
[12:31.79]Sand castle, okay.
[12:33.05]Discover grass.
[12:34.89]I don't care about this right now.
[12:43.64]So I can't... Oops-a-daisy.
[12:47.04]It was a quality bit, don't worry.
[12:52.10]So, I guess I can just have these dumb quests?
[12:56.24]Okay, well, what do you want me to do?
[12:58.23]I need a pirate throne to make this ship feel like home.
[13:04.51]He needs... a throne.
[13:09.65]Can't I just, like, break this guy's fucking jaw and take that gold brick?
[13:13.21]Isn't that what a pirate would do?
[13:14.89]Smash everything, it's a Lego game.
[13:21.49]Why do I have Super Mario sounds?
[13:26.23]Oh.
[13:33.57]They're really... Wow, Nintendo's gonna be fast!
[13:36.17]Alright, let's... Break shit?
[13:40.86]I'm kind of trying.
[13:44.36]Alright, well, I'm... Okay, now I got enough.
[13:46.88]Is this like Minecraft?
[13:47.62]Do I have to, like... Can I smash stuff?
[13:51.47]I can't really break the tree, can I?
[13:52.83]Whatever.
[13:53.25]I think I have enough.
[14:00.27]Let's get the discovery tool.
[14:02.35]Discover this fucking thing.
[14:04.37]And there we go.
[14:05.89]Bang.
[14:07.83]Bang.
[14:10.55]Yeah, I'd like to place the pig.
[14:13.49]I would like for you to place this pig.
[14:15.72]I would love it if you would place the pig.
[14:19.10]Come on.
[14:23.06]Place the pig.
[14:29.20]Do I need 1,200 to place this?
[14:32.13]Because it's telling me I can.
[14:33.35]Come on.
[14:37.47]What?
[14:40.75]Okay, well, I guess I need more money.
[14:43.01]Apparently.
[14:47.84]Place the... You guys don't think I'm left... What?
[14:50.56]You guys don't think I'm left-clicking right now?
[14:53.26]Left click!
[14:54.72]I can't- apparently I can shoot him from back here.
[14:58.09]Left click.
[14:58.51]Yeah, I was left clicking the whole time.
[15:02.97]Legitimately was left clicking.
[15:05.83]And apparently one got out.
[15:14.66]I'm having trouble with the kids- I was left clicking!
[15:17.42]It's not my fault this game should be fuckin' in early access for like another six months.
[15:22.40]The first golden step on the road to becoming a master builder.
[15:26.99]But you'll need two more gold bricks.
[15:30.05]Just like GTA.
[15:31.21]I got two.
[15:33.15]Look at those.
[15:33.65]See the four stars?
[15:34.39]See those hearts?
[15:34.85]Those are four stars.
[15:36.06]Here comes the FBI.
[15:38.56]Never gonna catch me.
[15:43.18]What was I supposed to do?
[15:44.40]Oh, go this way.
[15:47.53]Is there a sprint?
[15:55.70]What did I just do that for?
[16:01.02]What's the point of that?
[16:07.51]Captain wants a pirate clock tower, but I can't open the chest to open the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:12.05]You need... You need, like, a lantern.
[16:15.27]Okay, tab.
[16:15.97]Tab.
[16:22.32]Okay.
[16:23.96]Sand castle.
[16:26.42]Whatever.
[16:26.72]Uh, I guess I can discover this shit.
[16:31.01]Well, thorny bush.
[16:34.69]What else is back here?
[16:36.57]What are those?
[16:36.91]Skeletons?
[16:37.73]Okay, I just discovered a skeleton.
[16:39.37]Nice.
[16:43.24]Discover the- Okay, discover the seaweed.
[16:44.68]Discover the fish.
[16:46.68]Must be caught.
[16:47.52]Okay.
[16:50.20]Yeah, what is a pirate clock tower?
[16:51.84]I don't really know.
[16:52.64]Look at all these quests that just opened up.
[16:56.85]Alright, let's go.
[17:00.17]What does it want me to do here?
[17:06.88]It's blinking on tab, but I don't really have any options here.
[17:09.14]Oh, I guess it's just showing me the new things.
[17:14.50]Alright.
[17:16.62]Well, I just made those.
[17:18.21]Apparently.
[17:20.17]Here's like my unlock screen or something.
[17:21.73]I have no idea.
[17:22.17]I'm going to go back and get this thing.
[17:36.78]Oh.
[17:38.31]What's that?
[17:39.85]Treasure chest.
[17:40.37]I can't discover that.
[17:41.13]What's back here?
[17:41.79]I'm going to get out of the way.
[17:45.95]Why can I not discover this?
[17:46.77]Okay.
[17:48.51]Discovered a torch pole.
[17:54.84]Anything else?
[18:04.54]There it is.
[18:04.88]Come here.
[18:10.31]I can actually get in the boat.
[18:11.23]Alright.
[18:16.11]Well, I want to discover the lantern.
[18:17.31]It's right there.
[18:21.86]New discovery type unlocked.
[18:23.75]I can make a motorcycle?
[18:25.05]Vehicles.
[18:27.31]No, I want to discover that.
[18:30.07]I want this thing.
[18:32.91]Well, I just unlocked the boat.
[18:36.37]Okay.
[18:38.11]Well.
[18:39.81]Whatever you say.
[18:40.35]I actually want to get in this.
[18:57.63]Open!
[19:02.15]What's in here?
[19:05.81]It was in the chest.
[19:09.02]Is this person that fucking dumb that they're asking me to find... ...this?
[19:15.88]It's in the chest behind them.
[19:17.04]We're putting it right there.
[19:17.82]You know what?
[19:19.56]Fuck you, lady.
[19:22.28]It's going right there.
[19:22.96]Clever streamer.
[19:31.10]I need two more gold bricks.
[19:31.96]Okay, can I climb this?
[19:34.32]That'd be fun if I could climb it.
[19:50.83]Okay, I can't climb the ladder, but I can climb the wall like Spider-Man.
[19:56.23]I don't know why this seems to make no sense to me.
[20:03.14]Can I go to the top?
[20:05.70]Oh, whatever.
[20:06.08]Just get out of here.
[20:06.70]Okay.

[22:21.98]Is the throne up?

[23:33.96]What is this thing?
[23:35.73]Is that a throne?
[23:38.79]No, it's a fucking sand castle.
[23:46.43]Turn.
[23:47.64]There's a horn?
[23:48.22]Alright, go, go, go.
[23:53.42]We're over this way.
[23:56.86]And we're going to beep the horn.
[23:59.40]Pick it up.
[24:01.86]Here's the throne.
[24:07.08]Easy enough.
[24:09.82]Let's go ahead and make a pirate throne.
[24:11.18]Alright.
[24:17.12]Cool.
[24:17.82]I can just pick up this fish, can't I?
[24:23.73]Why would I even get in the boat at this point?
[24:26.89]Wait, what's going on?
[24:27.76]Did I miss something?
[24:28.72]Why does this still have a gigantic beam on it?
[24:34.94]Did I not discover it or something?
[24:38.22]No, okay.
[24:38.98]Well, I discovered a campfire now.
[24:43.22]Alright, well... Should I... I unlocked the campfire.
[24:47.67]Cool.
[24:52.11]Why am I not streaming Horizon?
[24:53.95]Because I don't have very much time tonight.
[25:00.02]Tonight is just kind of chilling until Pax East is tomorrow.
[25:04.14]So I'm just kind of playing this to relax a little bit.
[25:06.78]Because I have to get ready to leave to be able to go to Pax East for the next three days.
[25:13.52]So let's go give this guy his throne.
[25:17.87]Yeah, bonfire lit.
[25:20.50]Okay, let's go ahead and give this guy his dumb throne thing, whatever.
[25:26.64]There you go.
[25:31.20]Right here.
[25:33.39]I love you too, thank you.
[25:34.63]Alright.
[25:39.81]Alright!
[25:41.47]Hold on a second.
[25:42.61]Hold on a second.
[25:50.33]I got the little tube.
[25:52.85]Somebody just gave a fucking shitload of money.
[25:54.67]Hold on a second.
[25:57.79]This game's gonna go on pause for a second here.
[26:02.54]Somebody just gave me three gold bricks.
[26:07.57]Alright, first of all, Goodboy gave me a thousand bits a little while ago.
[26:12.13]Thank you for the ten bucks, dude.
[26:13.09]Thank you, Goodboy.
[26:14.14]They say nerd.
[26:15.56]Well, thank you.
[26:17.22]But, Spoychem gave me a hundred dollars.
[26:25.19]Goddamn, dude.
[26:25.99]Thank you.
[26:27.05]It says, Minecraft looks a little different than I remember.
[26:32.11]Well, it does.
[26:34.39]It does.
[26:36.05]It looks fairly different, but, dudes, boy.
[26:38.83]And why did this happen?
[26:42.82]Why am I playing on a little Game Boy screen?
[26:46.36]Alt-tabbing this game because you can't.
[26:48.54]It turns it into a little, like, fucking CRTV screen.
[26:52.88]And I can't even see that.
[26:54.02]Oh, god damn it.
[26:55.06]What does that say?
[26:56.36]That's not on my screen.
[26:57.24]I have to look over at the OBS screen.
[26:59.89]Where's the settings so I can do this again?
[27:03.31]Do you tell me I have to leave the fucking game to do this?
[27:06.17]No way.
[27:07.51]What the fuck?
[27:10.13]Why?
[27:10.53]Dude, LEGO is such like a huge brand.
[27:14.89]How is this game like... I can't alt-tab the game?
[27:20.69]I don't know what any of these are.
[27:22.53]Okay, I... Hold on.
[27:24.21]Let me like full screen OBS.
[27:29.31]So I can read what that says.
[27:31.33]Okay.
[27:32.27]Great.
[27:34.02]Oh my god, dude.
[27:36.36]What the fuck?
[27:39.02]Settings, there we go.
[27:39.84]Effect setting.
[27:43.50]Why the fuck is it blinking?
[27:45.06]Sound effects, camera angle, video settings.
[27:51.46]Okay.
[27:53.18]Vertical sync, off, windowed mode.
[27:55.30]Off, I can't do windowed mode, except please give me back to... There we go.
[28:02.17]No, this is just...
[28:06.97]I swear to God.
[28:09.11]I swear to God.
[28:12.79]Like, what on Earth in your video game's code do you have something where... This is not correct.
[28:23.32]Yeah, I can't move my mouse down further than this.
[28:37.86]Please.
[28:39.44]Please, let me just get to the video settings so I can fix this shit.
[28:44.95]Ugh!
[28:47.23]And now it's gonna be like 800 by 600 again, isn't it?
[28:50.17]Thank God.
[28:50.87]Get me the fuck out of this.
[28:54.05]Holy shit.
[28:57.48]Alright, what do I need to do?
[28:58.50]But seriously, though, thank you for the $100, dude.
[29:00.34]That's a lot of money.
[29:05.28]Alright, let's go over here.
[29:08.81]This is supposed to be relaxing.
[29:10.19]I know.
[29:10.51]Here, take my 300,000 bits.
[29:12.47]I can get in here, right?
[29:13.93]I can't... I believe I'm stuck here.
[29:41.45]I can't... I can't do anything right now.
[29:43.72]I'm currently stuck inside of the boat.
[29:46.10]Of the fucking R2-D2, whatever the hell this is.
[29:49.20]Just fucking stop spawning chickens at this point.
[29:51.64]Let me get the fuck... Please get me... Let me get into my ship!
[30:04.81]Okay, Q.
[30:09.35]The galaxy map shows you the world you've been to, the world you're on, and the world you're yet to explore.
[30:17.25]Collect more gold bricks, and you'll be able to travel farther afield to bigger worlds with more biomes and a huge variety of new discoveries.
[30:28.99]Okay, so it wants me to go here.
[30:33.15]Go to world.
[30:40.44]Stop memeing this instant.
[30:43.66]Alright, well, we're good.
[30:44.84]We're ready to go into some guy's world.
[30:50.38]The chicken noises are still in the background.
[30:52.23]56%, we're almost there.
[30:54.63]95%, 98%.
[30:54.67]Houston, put it into hyperdrive!
[30:55.53]Drying out deserts.
[31:10.73]Launching cows.
[31:11.97]98%.
[31:12.11]Hey, Chewie!
[31:15.50]Punch it!
[31:17.14]Oh, we're burning up in the atmosphere!
[31:22.12]My fucking ship explodes and that's the end of the game.
[31:24.22]Okay.
[31:35.85]Okay.
[31:37.59]Ooh, I wonder whose, look at, whose world is this?
[31:40.74]Ooh, 10.
[31:40.84]Hmm.
[31:40.92]Hmm.
[31:41.00]Discovered this crab.
[32:03.79]I actually like- I kind of like this.
[32:10.57]This is like kind of fun.
[32:16.99]Is it weird that I think this is fun?
[32:19.97]Just wait.
[32:20.75]Just wait till I can make my own world.
[32:23.16]In like seven hours.
[32:25.36]Gonna discover the crows.
[32:27.46]Oh, no I can't.
[32:30.97]Yeah, but look at how, look, somebody made this volcano.
[32:32.83]That's so, dude, here's the thing about this game.
[32:36.39]Somebody made this.
[32:38.87]Look at the Super Mario ripoff!
[32:40.92]I told you!
[32:42.02]I fucking told you this was a Mario ripoff.
[32:43.94]This is Mario 64, it does the same thing.
[32:45.84]There's a naked guy over here.
[32:55.05]What's going on?
[32:55.51]Can I talk to you?
[32:57.15]Can I discover the caveman?
[33:03.32]Okay, quest not found.
[33:04.72]I know, I'm just exploring.
[33:06.73]Oh, whatever, let's go.
[33:08.03]Let me get this Mario rip-off.
[33:20.88]Ooh, there's a new item.
[33:23.12]It's... The Shock Chalker.
[33:28.82]Terrain tool.
[33:29.22]The landscape tool.
[33:31.16]The landscape tool gives you the power to reshape the land around you.
[33:35.18]I can't wait.
[33:36.18]Raise up a mountain.
[33:37.90]Dig yourself a valley.
[33:40.08]Or flatten an entire village.
[33:43.29]You have the landscape tool.
[33:45.69]You have the power.
[33:47.75]Nice.
[33:51.03]Alright, so I believe that's on the utility belt, right?
[33:55.28]There it is.
[33:58.43]Okay, well, don't tell me that I have the power, and then don't let me use the power that you just told me I had.
[34:04.35]It's a little unfair.
[34:09.92]Well, let's go ahead and talk to this guy.
[34:12.02]She's stuck.
[34:12.52]You rescue.
[34:13.84]Me give this.
[34:14.28]Flatten a village.
[34:14.66]Flatten a village.
[34:15.12]Alright, so let's do it.
[34:30.53]Place bricks, swap, delete, change cursor size.
[34:33.61]Oh, shit.
[34:36.31]Oh, that's huge!
[34:42.82]I did it.
[34:47.96]I don't... What did I do?
[34:49.06]Okay.
[34:53.28]I did it.
[34:54.00]I win.
[34:55.30]Please dig the landscape responsibly.
[34:59.05]So, hold on.
[34:59.57]Let me get that open again.
[35:00.51]What did I just do?
[35:02.91]How do I delete?
[35:14.78]Why did I do that?
[35:18.38]Wait, hold on.
[35:18.82]Undo.
[35:19.08]Undo.
[35:26.55]We can just rewind time.
[35:28.07]That's fucking so cool.
[35:29.25]I'm so glad that exists.
[35:30.35]Can I toggle axis?
[35:33.87]Okay.
[35:35.39]Axis, locks, axi.
[35:37.93]Draw a line, hold, left shift.
[35:41.40]Lock the cursor.
[35:42.38]Okay, we got a lot here.
[35:45.32]Pan, put away.
[35:47.46]Alright, we'll figure that out as we go.
[35:52.88]No rewinds.
[35:57.77]Alright, do it again.
[35:59.50]He's stuck.
[36:00.24]Yep.
[36:00.74]I know how to get him out of there.
[36:03.28]This isn't the first time I've ever done something like this.
[36:05.84]Yeah.
[36:06.30]You know how I helped your other friend?
[36:08.74]We do a big, giant, green square.
[36:12.74]See?
[36:13.10]He's fine.
[36:13.54]I don't think he's fine.
[36:23.60]How come this worked last time?
[36:26.32]There he is.
[36:28.76]Now we just delete it.
[36:33.00]See?
[36:33.80]I saved him.
[36:41.24]Alright, congratulations.
[36:42.32]I got him.
[36:43.54]He's rescued.
[36:46.94]The landscape tool gives you many choices.
[36:49.84]Now, choose how to rescue this poor fellow unlocked.
[36:57.77]Oh, shit.
[36:58.86]Whoa, hold on a second.
[37:03.20]Somebody just gave $250.
[37:03.98]Are you shitting me in one go about it?
[37:07.82]Hold on a minute.
[37:09.28]Hold on.
[37:09.60]Captain Planet with metal arm just gave 25,000 bits.
[37:11.37]250 bucks.
[37:27.54]They say, I said I'd do it, Jerma, and I'm doing it.
[37:31.11]Well, Captain Planet... That's... That's a lot of money to give in one go.
[37:39.80]Holy shit, dude.
[37:41.38]Like, thanks.
[37:44.28]A $250 joke you are owed.
[37:45.68]Like, I don't even know what a $250... I mean, I've done $100 jokes before, right?
[37:51.85]I've never done a $250 joke before.
[37:53.79]I don't know.
[37:55.59]I'm not sure I'm capable of it.
[37:57.97]We'll have to see.
[38:01.81]But, thank you so fucking much.
[38:06.97]I'm going to have a $250 joke incoming.
[38:09.87]I better be good.
[38:16.01]Buy me Overwatch.
[38:20.07]I'm crashing the bid economy.
[38:21.46]Sell, sell, sell.
[38:28.24]The clown car fun.
[38:29.36]Let me just dump these too.
[38:30.50]I need five more, right?
[38:36.17]It might not be on this stream, though.
[38:37.63]You know what I'm saying?
[38:42.85]I'm not sure there's a $250 bit here.
[38:46.59]It's possible, but I'm not sure.
[38:52.57]You can choose either to raise or lower terrain.
[38:55.97]We're going to lower the terrain.
[38:56.87]Whichever you go for really depends on the situation.
[38:59.93]Unlocked.
[39:01.35]Raise and lower.
[39:02.47]Okay, hold on.
[39:03.63]Let me make this smaller.
[39:07.65]Open menu.
[39:10.65]Oh, draw a line.
[39:14.84]Oh, okay, I see.
[39:16.30]There we go.
[39:19.94]Alright, whatever.
[39:22.14]Am I saying that Legos are not funny?
[39:23.86]No, I'm just saying that this scenario, I'm not sure there's going to be any real big laughs in this game.
[39:31.83]We've had a couple of chuckles so far, but I'm not sure there's any big laughs.
[39:39.80]Everybody's stuck on this world.
[39:43.08]Wait, you mean really?
[39:44.26]Like, everyone that plays this game gets stuck on this world?
[39:47.80]There must be a way to bridge this lava.
[39:50.54]Let's do this quick.
[39:51.22]You could use the landscape tool to place some bricks.
[39:54.58]Unlocked.
[39:55.60]Add and remove.
[39:58.44]Okay, add, remove, draw a line.
[40:01.68]Where am I going?
[40:03.98]Let's make this guy a little bridge.
[40:08.46]Alright, come on over here.
[40:11.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:12.51]Come on, one more.
[40:15.13]Come on now.
[40:20.70]Oh, for the love of God.
[40:24.28]I thought I lost him forever.
[40:25.38]I thought that guy was gone forever.
[40:34.57]Alright, only a few more.
[40:39.83]You could build an island out at sea, or a stairway to the clouds.
[40:45.17]Your tools, your decision.
[40:47.90]That volcano looks dangerous.
[40:50.30]You might want to take this opportunity to get out of here.
[40:53.34]Get out of here?
[40:55.94]Don't I need ten bricks to get out of here?
[40:58.28]I have six in there.
[41:02.53]There's no more.
[41:04.45]Six out of ten.
[41:07.93]Where did I get this?
[41:12.84]Can I just get out of here?
[41:15.85]I guess I can.
[41:16.87]Alright, well, there's here.
[41:22.47]New worlds available.
[41:24.05]How do I make my own world?
[41:25.95]I guess this is it, right?
[41:27.01]6 out of 10.
[41:39.82]I can't wait to do all this tutorial shit, and then me get to an actual world, and just, it's total carnage.
[41:49.00]There's just gonna be no rhyme or reason to anything.
[41:56.51]That's what I'm looking forward to.
[42:02.91]What, this is candy cane land?
[42:05.97]You need a hundred golden bricks to make your own world.
[42:11.49]Really?
[42:11.81]I'm not going to get 100 gold bricks.
[42:21.50]I knew it was Candy Land.
[42:22.88]This is awesome.
[42:25.32]This is fucking awesome.
[42:26.60]This is the best world so far.
[42:29.41]I want this to be my land.
[42:33.97]Oh, that's so awesome.
[42:35.69]Look at this.
[42:36.51]Why are all these things getting hit by meteors?
[42:40.74]Every single one of these worlds is getting hit by a fucking meteor.
[42:44.66]Why would you want to live here?
[42:49.14]Coffee tool.
[42:55.57]The copy tool.
[42:57.15]The copy tool makes it easy to take copies of things you find.
[43:01.63]You can also use it to duplicate your own creations.
[43:05.38]Just place the box around any brick-built model that you like the look of, adjust the size, copy it, and then you can place it anywhere you like.
[43:14.76]You can also save creations to the My Builds gallery so you can take them to other worlds.
[43:21.36]Okay.
[43:25.68]Well, it definitely wants me to do this, right?
[43:27.52]Let's do it.
[43:29.00]Put this away.
[43:30.95]Where's the copy tool?
[43:33.21]Alright, so.
[43:35.05]Pan.
[43:36.37]Cursor up, down.
[43:37.39]Okay, whole drag box.
[43:45.24]I want to get this whole thing here.
[43:52.70]Hold on.
[43:55.86]I want to keep the candy house.
[43:58.04]It's very important to me.
[44:00.34]I wish I could move the camera.
[44:03.90]Okay, got it.
[44:09.14]Got that.
[44:09.60]Let's get this.
[44:14.49]Come on.
[44:16.25]Come on.
[44:18.63]Come on, get the whole thing.
[44:21.15]I want the whole thing.
[44:21.99]There it is.
[44:23.87]Right?
[44:25.17]Got it.
[44:27.54]Got it.
[44:29.12]What is fucking happening?
[44:33.42]What the fuck is going on?
[44:39.70]Copy.
[44:42.70]Yeah, what?
[44:45.00]This wasn't part of the tutorial.
[44:50.15]Box select.
[44:52.27]Yeah, that's good.
[44:56.22]I've lost control!
[45:06.98]What am I doing?
[45:07.51]Stop this!
[45:07.89]Stop it!
[45:08.21]Stop it!
[45:08.45]Stop it!
[45:08.73]Stop it!
[45:09.01]This is not gonna happen.
[45:17.59]This looks like my video card broke.
[45:22.76]Uh, hold on.
[45:23.98]I can save this.
[45:26.33]Can I undo?
[45:26.93]I don't know.
[45:32.77]Yeah, performance-wise, this really hasn't been that... It's been alright.
[45:39.09]It's like it never happened, you know what I mean?
[45:43.73]This is cool.
[45:45.07]What the fuck is up here?
[45:47.83]Wait, it undoes the house, but not all the plates.
[45:50.40]Okay.
[45:54.02]Where am I?
[45:55.50]Where did I go?
[45:56.10]Uh-oh, this is not good.
[45:59.84]$250 well spent.
[46:03.28]That wasn't the $250 joke.
[46:04.99]That was not a joke at all.
[46:08.07]That was just purely me having fun.
[46:10.39]Alright, well, let's go.
[46:15.47]I know that I am capable of doing that now.
[46:19.98]And by the way, if I can, like, parkour and, like, climb these, I'm gonna do it.
[46:26.83]Come on, let me, like, make this a real Mario game and let me climb this stuff.
[46:32.07]Oh, well.
[46:36.17]You'd love to see what's happening, but you just got a two-minute Nickelodeon ad?
[46:40.54]Well, I don't know why that happened.
[46:45.74]Just like Zelda, what's in here?
[46:51.29]Paint tool.
[46:52.77]Nice.
[46:54.27]Here comes the tutorial, right?
[46:58.51]The paint tool.
[47:00.29]Select the paint tool to change the color of anything in your world.
[47:04.72]Just choose a color and slap it all over the place.
[47:09.10]Go crazy!
[47:11.44]Or just paint one brick at a time.
[47:13.74]Make your world a brighter place.
[47:15.91]And notice that changing a brick's color can sometimes change its characteristics.
[47:21.31]Painted black, painted pink, painted lava.
[47:27.37]You guys want to make like the nothing from the never-ending story?
[47:31.51]Here it comes.
[47:34.69]Here comes the nothing.
[47:37.27]No, it's the nothing.
[47:41.18]I need, okay, hold on.
[47:42.30]Let's get, let's make this, let's make the nothing.
[47:45.20]What color is it?
[47:47.26]How do I make a different color?
[47:49.76]Change cursor, pick shape, pick mode.
[47:53.10]Bright blue.
[47:57.44]How do I change the color?
[48:00.19]Color not available.
[48:09.94]This is really cool, but I don't know how to actually pick colors here.
[48:14.89]Do I have to, like, scroll over a color I want?
[48:18.02]Like the red?
[48:18.58]Okay, pick.
[48:20.94]I get it.
[48:22.32]You have to actually, like, that's... I don't like that.
[48:25.72]Color not available.
[48:26.74]Why the fuck would that color not be available?
[48:28.54]It's kind of irritating.
[48:50.99]That's so cool.
[48:52.49]That's really cool.
[48:53.57]Alright, let me just... I'm having too much fun being a fucking idiot.
[48:58.17]Let's actually do this quest so we can get out of the tutorial.
[49:01.37]Top left?
[49:03.03]Oh, there you go.
[49:03.95]Here comes the nothing.
[49:08.66]Oh, whatever.
[49:09.82]That's too long of a bit to do.
[49:11.00]Can you paint my house something colorful?
[49:13.54]It's a shame when something looks that plain.
[49:16.14]It really could do with a splash of color.
[49:21.02]We're gonna paint your house... Let's see, do we want... What color do we want her house to be?
[49:27.70]What color pee?
[49:28.45]Do we want... Dehydrated piss?
[49:32.09]Do we want... You drank a water an hour ago?
[49:35.55]You're drinking too much water.
[49:37.39]Or you need to see a doctor.
[49:39.93]Which one?
[49:43.31]I think I'm gonna go with... I'm gonna go with you've had a little too much water.
[49:47.18]That's the one I want.
[49:50.03]Yeah, okay.
[49:56.72]Alright, I didn't pick that one.
[49:58.14]I want this one.
[50:09.00]This is fun.
[50:12.28]You need to go see a doctor?
[50:13.62]No, I... I want to do the, like, you had a little too much water.
[50:21.28]This is terrible.
[50:25.49]Alright, I did it!
[50:28.67]I painted your whole house.
[50:30.95]I painted your whole house default don't have color on the 3D model.
[50:35.67]Alright, you're welcome.
[50:39.37]I'm done.
[50:57.82]Another challenge overcome and a just reward You guys you guys That's P. That's P. That's not something else Come on
[51:18.11]No, that's not the $250 joke.
[51:19.11]You'll know when you see the $250 joke.
[51:20.17]Because I will say it is the $250 joke.
[51:21.79]Build a new wall?
[51:34.91]We only have one more thing to learn.
[51:37.35]The build tool.
[51:39.37]This is the build tool.
[51:41.59]Giving you ultimate control over the fundamental building blocks of the universe.
[51:45.84]Yes, I can't wait.
[51:46.56]I love Legos.
[51:46.90]You can increase your collection of bricks by capturing those pesky troublemakers.
[51:51.62]What?
[51:51.88]Be creative.
[51:53.38]Make something amazing.
[51:55.92]Why do I have to?
[51:57.36]Make something amazing.
[51:58.86]Excellent.
[52:02.62]Whoa.
[52:05.72]Ah, building one brick at a time.
[52:09.44]The old-fashioned way.
[52:11.56]Now you can make exactly what you want to in every detail.
[52:17.22]Toggle, draw a line.
[52:18.50]Alright, what about like, okay, color.
[52:22.96]Okay, here are the different bricks.
[52:25.11]I was a real big fan.
[52:27.03]I'll tell you, I used to use these little skinny ones.
[52:31.04]These little skinny ones were my absolute favorite, but I don't have any access to them at all.
[52:37.49]That's okay.
[52:39.37]I'm going to go with... I'm going to go with Azure.
[52:49.47]That's fine the way it is.
[52:51.76]Alright, let's place it.
[52:52.78]Does it matter?
[52:53.22]Does it have to be like right there?
[52:54.58]Can it just be like here?
[53:01.18]Alright, um... It's not pretty, but... You know, it's okay.
[53:12.97]I need to, like, toggle the axis.
[53:14.49]Like, there we go.
[53:15.63]That's better.
[53:18.53]Right?
[53:25.97]Uh...
[53:35.41]Wait, what?
[53:38.69]Hopefully, I'm not getting paid to do this.
[53:44.23]Why can I not make a line?
[53:53.92]I did it.
[53:54.34]Okay.
[53:56.44]There you go, lady.
[53:57.98]I broke through your wall.
[54:00.48]That'll be $400.
[54:13.17]Well, that's that.
[54:15.65]Can I lock?
[54:16.07]I think I can.
[54:18.55]I can.
[54:19.39]I can.
[54:20.11]I can.
[54:21.35]More and more different kinds.
[54:22.75]Oh, what is this thing?
[54:27.17]Like a wheelbarrow?
[54:32.83]If I had any friends, somebody could get in this.
[54:37.35]Right?
[54:41.98]I could have such a fun time with, like, a friend if they were in this right now.
[54:44.82]Imagine.
[54:48.30]Alright.
[54:48.80]Last one, then we get out of here.
[54:50.36]Houses standing all alone are a sorry sight.
[54:53.85]There should be at least one more to keep it company.
[54:57.47]Okay, so we're gonna copy this house and put another house in here, right?
[55:03.14]Copy.
[55:05.36]Yeah.
[55:06.44]Drag.
[55:08.72]Fill that.
[55:11.08]Okay.
[55:12.60]Let me go up.
[55:14.86]I can't wait to just copy somebody else's house.
[55:18.68]Okay.
[55:20.14]You can adjust the finer details of your model here.
[55:23.63]Add bricks, remove bricks, or just leave it as it is.
[55:28.05]If you're happy with it, name it, frame it, save it for later.
[55:31.65]Now don't forget, the discovery tool can place anything from your collection, including any models that you've saved.
[55:39.10]Oh.
[55:40.46]That's cool.
[55:42.94]Oh, look at that!
[55:45.14]Cool.
[55:46.75]Cool!
[55:54.91]Wow, you just throw up a house.
[55:56.37]That's so cool.
[55:57.71]How come I didn't do that animation last time?
[56:04.10]That was an elaborate animation that did not happen last time.
[56:06.30]Alright, I think I'm able to play in a game right now.
[56:11.87]We're good.
[56:13.06]I think we're ready to do it on our own.
[56:16.60]Leveled up.
[56:24.18]Cool.
[56:24.92]What?
[56:25.52]The way I said cool?
[56:26.44]What's wrong with that?
[56:27.18]Cool.
[56:27.58]Dad.
[56:27.66]Why is Albert Wesker our tutorial host?
[56:30.04]Get back to the rocket if you want to inject the T-virus into your body.
[56:35.66]Just a second a minute.
[56:56.14]Alright.
[56:57.28]Let's go to a world.
[56:57.98]We're gonna invade somebody's world.
[57:04.85]Your rocket can take you to new worlds.
[57:07.91]Head back there when you want to seek out adventure elsewhere.
[57:11.91]I'm ready.
[57:14.74]I'm ready.
[57:19.00]I'm ready.
[57:21.78]Before I go, though.
[57:24.59]Hey, you know, like, remember when you guys were, like, really concerned?
[57:27.91]All you people on this planet?
[57:30.22]Everyone always talks about it.
[57:31.44]They're like, no, that'll never happen to us.
[57:33.34]What about, what happens if the aliens come?
[57:35.72]What happens if the aliens come and consume all of our resources?
[57:39.07]Yeah, you ever, like, have that fucking scary thought?! !
[58:00.66]Go, quick, go!
[58:01.50]Get up before they even knew you were here.
[58:09.50]Go!
[58:11.38]That's not the $250 joke.
[58:13.06]It's not gonna happen this stream.
[58:20.55]The $250 joke is not gonna happen on this stream.
[58:24.21]That's a $2.50 joke.
[58:28.74]She just turns around and has a Satan face?
[58:31.70]Alright, wait, what am I unlocking?
[58:35.66]What are these worlds, and how do I, like, join a world?
[58:38.42]I feel like I don't want to do this.
[58:43.54]I can do another candy world.
[58:44.66]Alright, we're doing standard piece-of-shit world, okay?
[58:51.08]Select the find world button to discover new worlds in the galaxy.
[58:56.56]There is no limit to the number of unique worlds you can discover.
[59:00.30]Okay.
[59:00.97]Keep on clicking until you find one you like the look of.
[59:04.77]Find this world.
[59:07.41]Create a world.
[59:07.99]There's a hundred.
[59:08.97]Holy fuck.
[59:10.37]Find a random world.
[59:13.01]Two out of two.
[59:14.21]Three out of three.
[59:15.61]Four out of four.
[59:16.37]Five out of five.
[59:17.09]Six out of six.
[59:17.71]Seven out of seven.
[59:18.29]Eight out of eight.
[59:20.75]What does this even mean?
[59:21.49]10 out of 10?
[59:21.79]Are these like players that are playing in that game right now?
[59:31.26]Skydive.
[59:31.98]Is there a way that I can just... How can I tell?
[59:40.40]This place sucks.
[59:41.20]10 out of 10?
[59:45.81]Do you want to go to the little island?
[59:52.61]Join game, not play game.
[59:54.11]Okay, well, I like did the tutorial, right?
[59:56.31]So let's save and exit.
[59:57.19]Save and exit, okay.
[59:59.88]Let's just see what happens.
[60:05.68]I have a new cutscene now.
[60:10.52]What happened?
[60:14.89]Oh, okay.
[60:16.13]Alright, it's like a new game.
[60:21.03]Okay.
[60:23.42]I did a new save, okay, that's fine.
[60:26.04]So join game.
[60:27.98]No, that's not gonna work.
[60:30.62]Play, start new game online.
[60:33.86]Right?
[60:36.66]Oh, was I already there?
[60:37.56]Let's go to the island.
[60:47.01]Not new game.
[60:52.37]Just, like, load my current game?
[60:58.66]Are you... What are you talking about?
[61:00.42]There's, like, I don't have, like, any... When I click join game, it pops up, like, my Steam menu.
[61:09.50]And nothing shows up.
[61:10.17]Alright, I say, when I click join game, there is nothing here.
[61:15.29]It's literally as if I hit shift tab.
[61:17.03]There's nothing here.
[61:22.70]I have to, like, I gotta have, like, a friend, I think.
[61:25.68]Like, online.
[61:26.48]Hold on, let me see something.
[61:27.60]What if I do this?
[61:33.49]Yeah, I can't.
[61:39.11]No friend.
[61:39.61]Yeah, that's, like, co-op.
[61:45.81]Continue game.
[61:47.55]Host game.
[61:48.11]Oh, here we go.
[61:49.63]Continue game online.
[61:50.53]I can host a game, right?
[61:53.17]That would be fun.
[61:57.59]Oh, before you drank all of it.
[61:59.01]Oh, thank you.
[62:00.89]Thank you so much.
[62:02.41]So, if I just, like, continue the game online as a host?
[62:05.69]Because I don't have... Look, guys, I have this... No, I'm doing fine.
[62:13.27]Do that.
[62:13.69]I'm just going to do this.
[62:15.50]Continue on the current world.
[62:17.88]The game's server died?
[62:18.98]I don't know.
[62:20.42]It just came out of, like, early access, guys.
[62:24.37]Well, let's do that.
[62:24.91]Let's see what happens.
[62:27.79]If you get- whoever wants to, like, join me, go ahead and, like, build something cool for me.
[62:38.51]Host the game?
[62:39.07]Oh, I am.
[62:41.19]This is gonna be cra- How many people can be in one game?
[62:45.51]Invite people through Steam?
[62:47.51]My friends list on Steam, I physically can't add any more people.
[62:52.21]And why are we- why are we here?
[62:55.51]I don't want to be on this world.
[62:56.79]I fucked up this whole world.
[62:58.18]10 out of 15.
[63:01.28]Alright, well, who... Can I, like... I can't, like, invite anybody through Steam, unfortunately.
[63:17.25]I don't think that... I think I have to actually invite people.
[63:21.78]I'll just do this.
[63:23.90]I don't want to be on Lollipop World.
[63:32.00]Well, I'm just going to do this.
[63:35.47]I'm going to go to my own world.
[63:36.83]If people can find me, they can find me, I guess.
[63:38.53]Hi, guys.
[63:41.37]Go to the crime scene?
[63:42.33]What crime scene?
[63:45.31]Wasn't I doing a random world before?
[63:49.56]I'm so lost right now.
[63:51.04]One of the four.
[63:51.46]There you go.
[63:52.72]Is he Fred?
[63:54.42]I guess that's me.
[63:58.10]Sub invites.
[64:02.48]Return to the rocket.
[64:03.66]Let's just go to the rocket.
[64:04.46]I don't want to be here.
[64:06.54]Get the fuck out of this world.
[64:11.08]Get back in the ship.
[64:11.90]I think I'm just going to fly to a random world.
[64:16.76]Why not?
[64:18.33]Like this one.
[64:20.60]And I'm going to cause some carnage.
[64:24.40]No, no, no.
[64:26.28]Two out of two.
[64:26.80]Alright, this one.
[64:30.44]No, this one.
[64:32.22]We're going here.
[64:32.60]I don't even know what the fuck's here, but we're going here.
[64:34.78]What's the point of the game?
[64:35.60]You just have to build shit.
[64:37.49]It's like Minecraft.
[64:38.73]Have you ever played Minecraft?
[64:41.65]I've never played Minecraft.
[64:43.75]It is good.
[64:49.98]Can you join the group chat of your Steam group?
[64:52.72]Yeah, it's just... Steam is just messy.
[64:54.72]I wish Steam would allow you to not have to be friends with people.
[65:00.94]I wish I could just like... Can you even like invite people?
[65:04.45]I have like no friends on Steam.
[65:06.49]See, my Steam list is just like... You can't like stop people from adding you on Steam.
[65:13.83]So it's just like, my Steam friends list is just like, there's just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of notifications.
[65:20.53]So I don't even use it.
[65:21.61]I don't even like go online on Steam.
[65:23.36]It's kind of like Minecraft.
[65:26.78]Minecraft is like Lego to be fair.
[65:28.10]Yeah, that's great.
[65:30.27]Some enemies can only be defeated by using special weapons.
[65:34.67]Look out for different colored hearts for clues.
[65:39.38]Zombies are very hard to defeat when using standard weapons.
[65:43.88]If you have a powerful sword or an explosive item, show them no mercy.
[65:51.13]Apart from the zombie cheerleader, she is just so cute.
[65:57.25]In an evil, undeadly, brain-biting sort of way.
[66:02.96]This is a random world?
[66:04.04]I don't understand.
[66:06.80]This guy's fighting a fucking alligator.
[66:08.40]That guy died.
[66:09.50]That guy just died.
[66:12.16]This alligator's just fucking eating people on this planet.
[66:15.72]What was that?
[66:18.22]What?
[66:21.30]Okay.
[66:22.40]Yeah.
[66:23.34]So... Well, that guy is dead.
[66:28.78]This doesn't really seem to make very much sense.
[66:31.46]I'm riding an alligator skateboard now.
[66:33.11]Can we go in the water?
[66:35.37]I guess we can.
[66:41.31]Alright.
[66:43.37]Bye, alligator.
[66:44.01]That was fun.
[66:48.50]That was like the most interesting thing so far.
[66:50.12]Wait a minute, there's another boat.
[66:51.52]I'm gonna jump from this one to that one.
[66:54.40]Dude, see that one?
[66:55.20]See that play?
[66:56.04]That's a good play.
[66:58.46]Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's that?
[66:59.36]Is that Superman?
[67:01.26]Who the fuck is this guy?
[67:05.64]Oh, no, it's a scuba diver.
[67:10.16]I'm just being a dick.
[67:10.95]This guy didn't do anything wrong.
[67:14.13]What?
[67:17.25]Why am I doing this to this guy?
[67:19.25]You should probably get up, though.
[67:21.88]I should probably leave this guy alone.
[67:24.92]He was just trying to swim.
[67:25.74]Okay, this got much cooler.
[67:30.40]I'm going to get out of here.
[67:31.54]You need to go to Atlantis.
[67:33.38]I need to build something first.
[67:36.51]Mafia 3 has worse graphics than Lego World?
[67:39.71]Wait, is this just like the movie?
[67:42.37]No.
[67:43.41]There's like...
[67:46.41]dozens of Lego games out there.
[67:49.32]What is going on?
[67:51.02]Why am I getting, like, attacked?
[67:53.78]I just got killed by two fucking guys with these... Those guys went into the ground, by the way.
[67:58.46]Alright.
[67:59.28]Sure.
[68:00.08]That makes perfect sense.
[68:02.69]This park ranger, this guy has, like, a security... This is, like, a cop.
[68:05.27]He didn't do anything.
[68:06.41]Thanks a lot.
[68:07.83]Make sure your pants don't fall down.
[68:09.57]That's more important.
[68:12.49]What the fuck is even happening right now?
[68:16.31]I gotta pee.
[68:17.25]Let me piss.
[68:18.59]And then we can figure out what's even going on in this game, because I have no idea at this point.
[68:23.22]Two or three odd things just happened.
[68:24.76]All I was doing before was discovering stuff.
[68:27.28]Now I have to actually figure out what to do.
[68:28.80]Alright, bye guys.
[68:30.60]I gotta pee.
[68:31.06]I'll be right back.
[68:57.52]I'm sorry.
[70:32.38]Come on.
[71:09.25]Okay.
[71:11.79]You know, I noticed something, right?
[71:13.67]Like, on the dot... On the dot, when I stream, at like an hour and ten minutes, almost every stream, I have to pee.
[71:24.66]Every time.
[71:25.48]It's like, with... And I pee before every stream, too.
[71:29.98]Don't ask me why.
[71:30.86]Alright.
[71:31.30]Let's, uh... Let's try to do something.
[71:34.48]Don't do 800x600.
[71:35.48]Thank God.
[71:35.94]Okay.
[71:36.64]I can't even see the chat.
[71:41.48]Who's making these noises?
[71:44.13]It's in 800x600 again.
[71:45.67]God damn it.
[71:47.45]Oh my god.
[71:49.51]Why?
[71:49.99]Why?
[71:54.69]It's this guy.
[71:55.53]It's this fucking Pop-Tart.
[71:58.82]Wait, I have to make that joke.
[71:59.72]Here's your $250 joke.
[72:00.74]Hold on.
[72:02.32]Your $250 joke is incoming.
[72:04.28]Just shut up.
[72:05.16]Everybody shut up.
[72:07.54]Shut up.
[72:07.90]Shut up!
[72:13.43]Come on, I have a $250 joke incoming.
[72:16.09]Come on.
[72:22.11]Okay, shh, everybody, here we go.
[72:24.94]Profile, what the fuck?
[72:27.50]Here we go, shh, everybody, here we go, here we go.
[72:33.26]Troublemakers.
[72:35.08]They really can be a downright nuisance.
[72:36.98]I didn't expect this.
[72:39.53]But they're pretty adorable, aren't they?
[72:42.24]In any case, they'll be carrying bricks that you'll want to collect.
[72:46.00]And sometimes, they might be carrying something even more valuable.
[72:50.50]Chase them down and tackle them to the ground.
[72:52.76]That wasn't it.
[72:53.58]That wasn't what it was.
[72:54.54]Whatever.
[72:54.94]They can be hard to catch, so get creative.
[72:57.96]I was gonna punch the shit out of him, and when he died, I was gonna go, Oh, how's that?
[73:02.15]Crazy good!
[73:03.45]Are these... These are pirates?
[73:13.13]That guy's head just came off.
[73:16.13]No, he's just driving away.
[73:22.82]Where the fuck are you going?
[73:25.22]If I press Q, do I throw him off?
[73:29.76]Is he hostile?
[73:30.38]Does he even know I'm on here?
[73:31.48]Maybe I can sit in the boat.
[73:36.18]Yeah, I can.
[73:41.58]This is the shittiest ride I've ever been on.
[73:43.28]Anything else supposed to happen here?
[73:51.75]I'm just getting money.
[73:56.57]This guy's paying me to be his friend.
[73:59.67]Every so often I get paid money.
[74:05.59]Thanks, that was fun.
[74:11.58]I'm gonna fucking back over him.
[74:19.91]I haven't built anything yet.
[74:20.99]I'm just intrigued by this weird world.
[74:30.07]It's cool there is vehicles, though.
[74:31.31]I'm not sure where those guys... This boat doesn't work now.
[74:39.15]The boat's broken.
[74:39.88]No, it's not.
[74:42.15]Those are the zombies.
[74:45.69]Why was one of the zombies driving a boat?
[74:50.13]This is a fucking horse.
[74:53.23]Why are there random animals?
[74:57.06]This game is fucking stupid, but for some reason I like it.
[75:00.22]You know what?
[75:02.06]It's just animals here.
[75:05.06]Alright, well, let's...
[75:14.81]I'm a fucking psycho.
[75:24.41]None of these people have done anything wrong.
[75:27.51]I'm just deciding that they deserve to die.
[75:41.59]Alright, well, let me... Oh, discover the horse!
[75:43.49]You're right, you're right.
[75:44.03]Discover the horse.
[75:45.55]Good idea.
[75:48.57]I can't discover this horse.
[75:51.28]No.
[75:52.22]The horse cannot be discovered.
[75:54.56]Apparently.
[75:56.72]I have to do, like, a quest or something.
[75:59.10]The horse is asleep.
[76:01.04]That's fine.
[76:01.62]What about this guy?
[76:03.73]I lost all my food to some dreaded pirate.
[76:05.93]I will trade you this fantastic cutlass for some food.
[76:08.39]Yeah.
[76:22.80]Can he eat the horse?
[76:25.38]Am I a bad person for this?
[76:37.94]I can't.
[76:40.90]I can't!
[76:41.92]That's not how it works.
[76:43.84]It's not gonna do anything.
[76:45.40]Is it gonna do anything?
[76:53.37]Wait, why is the horse asleep?
[76:57.83]No, we're not going to do that yet.
[76:59.87]I'm going to examine some things.
[77:04.52]How much money do I have?
[77:06.36]$72,000?
[77:09.62]The trader roams the galaxy, searching for explorers in need of a variety of items.
[77:16.50]Sometimes rare, always.
[77:18.42]Wait, wait, wait, no!
[77:20.57]Look out for her hot air balloon at night.
[77:23.57]Stop it.
[77:24.27]Stop.
[77:25.15]Get out of the trade menu.
[77:27.85]Get the fuck out of the trade menu.
[77:29.27]There's a guy with a golden brick.
[77:31.72]Get out of here.
[77:32.48]I don't want to buy any more shit from you.
[77:33.92]I want to fucking tackle this guy.
[77:38.80]Come here.
[77:39.86]Come here, you little shit.
[77:41.32]Come here.
[77:45.43]Come here.
[77:46.53]Get over here.
[77:50.38]This is fucking dumb.
[77:53.42]This is dumb.
[77:56.72]I just want to get the- Help me, Seagull!
[78:00.10]Help me.
[78:04.30]Is that a cop?
[78:14.01]This is fucking some Tom and Jerry shit right here.
[78:18.67]No!
[78:22.93]Where are these people spawning in from?
[78:24.65]Why are we just getting seagull popping?
[78:34.98]What's the world deleting behind me for?
[78:38.80]You gotta be out of breath by now dude, come on.
[78:41.82]We're so far away.
[78:50.23]I can't... I can't do this anymore.
[78:55.95]Why is he just so perfectly faster than me in every regard?
[78:58.91]Is this a scuba diver here now?
[79:00.41]Like this has got to end.
[79:05.50]How do I pull out my gun?
[79:09.42]Oh my god.
[79:14.16]Got him!
[79:15.00]Nope.
[79:18.60]Just get back to land.
[79:19.76]Yeah, you're going the right way.
[79:20.46]Good.
[79:23.08]Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[79:24.98]Go that way.
[79:29.28]Chase him to land?
[79:30.26]Alright, he's almost on land.
[79:32.74]Now's my chance.
[79:33.30]Oh, for the love of God.
[79:42.11]Got it.
[79:45.73]Fucking little shit.
[79:47.79]Ugh.
[79:47.89]Alright, well, good.
[79:49.03]Got it.
[79:53.34]I have not done anything in this game so far.
[79:58.26]What is this?
[79:59.36]Wait, isn't that one of the burglars?
[80:00.96]And of course, the ability to take snaps in your worlds.
[80:14.07]Dude, can I, like, break this guy's neck from behind?
[80:15.69]See any rare red gems around?
[80:19.67]What's that guy?
[80:28.34]Oh, we discovered this giant footprint, but she fell down.
[80:32.40]Yeah, yeah, okay.
[80:34.30]I'll help her out.
[80:35.78]I'll do the terrain tool.
[80:38.12]You got it.
[80:41.73]Why do I want to break that guy's neck?
[80:43.13]Because he, like, tried to rob me.
[80:44.55]He, like, attacked me.
[80:45.29]Alright, landscape tool.
[80:47.66]Let's do this.
[80:51.58]There we go.
[80:53.34]Come on up.
[80:54.30]And there's a free gold brick.
[81:02.19]Wait, there's a blue jewel?
[81:03.39]I didn't even get a... Okay.
[81:04.87]Cool.
[81:10.55]Why am I holding it?
[81:14.62]I'm just holding a giant diamond.
[81:22.87]Where is this guy going?
[81:42.31]Nice job.
[81:42.81]You did good.
[81:48.33]Well, I'll go.
[81:49.35]Whatever.
[81:49.71]Fuck it.
[81:52.35]Why is my hair so luscious?
[81:53.49]Because that's one of the only things I can pick.
[82:01.71]More, more.
[82:02.43]No, I thought that was... No, no, no.
[82:05.38]Every man for himself.
[82:07.00]It's every man for himself.
[82:08.16]When somebody has a gold brick, you just go after them.
[82:15.18]I'm dead.
[82:17.64]God damn it.
[82:18.30]Do you still have it?
[82:21.01]This person just kicked my ass.
[82:28.97]You're telling me I can't even hurt this person?
[82:40.26]Watch out for the fucking ghost pirate that drives around in a circle again.
[82:45.02]No, I can't hurt this person.
[82:47.56]Okay.
[82:49.26]Well, whatever.
[82:49.84]We'll just go to the other gold brick thing.
[82:51.44]Let me discover some of this shit first.
[82:52.74]No more fucking around.
[82:53.66]Let's play.
[82:55.88]Discover this.
[82:56.46]Discover that.
[82:58.78]Discover that.
[83:00.97]Discover the boat.
[83:03.57]Got it.
[83:07.27]Jetty.
[83:13.23]What else can I discover?
[83:15.82]This.
[83:16.86]This thing.
[83:17.58]That thing.
[83:20.12]That thing.
[83:20.68]Okay.
[83:21.32]Now what do we do here?
[83:24.77]I need some protection.
[83:25.63]I can't have crocs.
[83:26.95]They're too mean.
[83:27.63]Maybe something green that's smaller.
[83:30.67]You want me to catch you frogs?
[83:33.23]Alright.
[83:35.77]Where the hell are their frogs?
[83:40.34]I've not seen one frog, by the way.
[83:44.69]Unlock the sword.
[83:45.47]Yeah, I gotta do that.
[83:48.02]Yeah, keep your eye out for green and red frogs.
[83:51.82]It's important.
[83:57.99]Anything else?
[84:00.93]What is that?
[84:03.11]This world sucks.
[84:05.81]I'm about to leave.
[84:10.64]I do want a sword, though.
[84:15.92]No!
[84:17.88]Not this again.
[84:19.12]Not this again.
[84:22.80]This has just been where I've gotten all my... What the hell am I doing?
[84:28.62]I'm riding... I'm riding the shark.
[84:36.68]Just get on land, please.
[84:39.74]Get on land.
[84:48.60]Out of the way.
[84:50.80]Out of the way.
[84:52.12]This guy's like, no, he has one of those.
[84:53.52]I want one too.
[84:55.56]Fuck off.
[84:57.21]No, not back into the water.

[85:12.69]Get back on land.
[85:13.48]Please.
[85:16.20]Shoot him.
[85:16.54]Dude, I would.
[85:17.36]If there was, like, a gun, I could just shoot him right in the back of the fucking head.
[85:22.08]Yeah, I gotta get closer.
[85:23.44]Get closer.
[85:24.08]There it is.
[85:30.39]What is that?
[85:35.03]Oh, wow.
[85:35.75]That dude has... That dude had fucking pyrite.
[85:39.31]He was carrying around pyrite.
[85:40.66]Fool's gold.
[85:44.21]It's like cop has one.
[85:45.71]What the fuck is going on?
[85:47.98]Why are people so insane?
[85:50.58]Sometimes people just have one I just frog splashed through the table Randomly people just have one I don't get this
[86:14.23]Well, there's a treasure chest down here, so I want it.
[86:19.23]Where the hell is it?
[86:28.74]Where's this chest?
[86:29.90]Down here?
[86:35.02]I can hold my breath longer than that.
[86:36.98]I swear to God.
[86:40.16]I can actually hold my breath longer than this guy.
[86:45.27]There it is.
[86:53.84]I don't understand where this is supposed to be.
[86:56.14]Do I destroy the terrain?
[87:02.64]What happens if I do this?
[87:09.90]I'll find the fucking thing.
[87:13.96]I'll find the chest.
[87:20.96]I'll find it.
[87:21.46]Where is it?
[87:28.12]Where's that chest?
[87:29.76]I'm gonna find it.
[87:40.24]It's all the way at the bottom of the beam.
[87:44.76]Check this out.
[87:45.66]It's all the way at the bottom.
[87:49.37]Term of the world eater.
[87:53.72]Well, I don't know why.
[87:54.42]I don't understand where it is.
[87:55.56]It's like down there somewhere, apparently.
[88:01.50]I'm changing worlds.
[88:02.26]I don't like this world.
[88:03.08]I don't like this world.
[88:09.45]Is that a frog?
[88:09.93]No.
[88:12.87]It's just spiders.
[88:15.49]It doesn't seem right.
[88:20.80]I do want the cutlass, though.
[88:22.71]How did I get that before?
[88:23.61]There's another police officer holding one of these.
[88:35.86]I'm just getting swarmed by these two guys.
[88:40.86]What am I supposed to do?
[88:41.86]This guy just keeps teasing me.
[88:51.61]I can't keep changing worlds, why not?
[88:54.43]Dude, there's so much shit in here that's... what the fuck is this?
[89:02.80]Everybody kills me so much faster than I can kill him.
[89:04.80]I get touched like twice and I'm dead.
[89:09.86]Maybe I can not kill the zombies?
[89:21.72]I just got wrecked.
[89:23.68]Let me, like, fill this.
[89:25.84]I have, like, three at least.
[89:26.94]Needed to use weapons.
[89:37.05]That's fine.
[89:40.45]That guy gives me the cutlass.
[89:41.91]What the hell did he want me to do?
[89:42.85]He's gonna use the pirate.
[89:52.43]There's this guy.
[89:54.67]No, stop running around.
[89:56.41]There's just a shark here.
[89:59.45]How did you even get over here?
[90:00.36]Can I... I can't run.
[90:09.78]I don't want to fight this guy for his brick.
[90:12.42]This guy had a quest.
[90:14.18]I want to know what it was.
[90:15.03]This guy is going to fight a shark on land right now.
[90:24.26]Are you serious?
[90:25.72]I needed that guy alive!
[90:37.41]Okay.
[90:38.77]I don't think I can do that quest.
[90:44.23]Well... Alright.
[90:49.27]Say goodbye to the Cutlass guys, because I can't get it anymore.
[90:56.73]Can I get off this island?
[91:03.67]What did you want me to do now?
[91:04.59]Rest without going all the way back to our lab?
[91:09.29]Need to make, like, a... What the hell am I doing?
[91:13.42]Let me see something here.
[91:16.86]Hold on.
[91:20.30]Brick builds.
[91:22.44]Objects.
[91:27.99]Vehicles.
[91:29.61]Creatures.
[91:30.41]No.
[91:35.58]Well, no idea.
[91:40.58]Somebody sighted a frog sighting?
[91:44.36]Somebody said there was a frog.
[91:45.16]Where was there a frog?
[91:48.04]A frog sighting.
[91:52.21]I can hear it.
[91:52.83]I can hear the frog, but I can't see it.
[91:56.45]Somebody's... Oh, I see a frog!
[91:57.99]Shh!
[92:00.43]Got him.
[92:01.81]Okay, green frog.
[92:03.61]I need a red frog now.
[92:07.03]Oh, nice.
[92:15.17]Why can't I discover this person?
[92:16.97]New discovery type unlocked.
[92:19.93]You've discovered your first character.
[92:21.91]Scientist?
[92:23.21]Characters can be unlocked when you've done a quest for them.
[92:26.75]Once unlocked and purchased, you can place them in the world.
[92:30.73]So this is two of the same person here now?
[92:38.60]How many scientists can I have?
[92:39.92]There's a rat.
[92:43.36]I've got to discover the rat.
[92:49.93]Nice.
[92:51.13]Brown rat.
[92:55.31]That guy is just speeding.
[92:56.43]That guy didn't figure it out.
[93:02.05]That guy doesn't understand you can't drive a boat into an island.
[93:06.29]I don't understand.
[93:09.23]I'm pressing the button to go and it's not working.
[93:27.25]Can I kill this guy, please?
[93:28.75]Oh, he's not paying any attention.
[93:31.27]Apparently not.
[93:39.34]Well, I can discover this.
[93:40.20]What happens if I remove it now?
[93:41.94]This guy's asleep.
[93:46.30]He just woke up.
[93:49.63]Seems a little angry.
[93:50.39]That's okay.
[93:54.37]Oh.
[94:03.54]Something happened.
[94:04.10]I'll snap his neck.
[94:07.84]I need a red frog.
[94:15.07]So I can finally... I can just get the hell out of here after this.
[94:17.29]I mean, I guess I could... What's the point of building anything here, though?
[94:26.29]Do you just do enough quests where you can...
[94:32.46]I guess you just do enough quests where you can leave and then you go to a different world and you get to 15, right?
[94:36.08]I don't understand.
[94:38.70]Well, let me give this guy his green frogs.
[94:40.16]Yeah, just put them here.
[94:51.33]There's your green frogs.
[94:52.31]Can I just paint these frogs red?
[94:56.72]Can I do that?
[95:00.38]I have to be able to do that, right?
[95:07.98]Can I just, like, cherry dip these frogs?
[95:19.50]No, I'm gonna go somewhere else.
[95:20.74]We'll check something else out.
[95:24.48]Discover enemies you knock out.
[95:25.78]I didn't even know that, but... Whoa, wait.
[95:28.44]No, it's a spider.
[95:29.55]It's a red spider, though.
[95:30.45]Do I have a red spider discovered?
[95:35.01]I just deleted it from the world.
[95:36.21]Okay, I was trying to discover it.
[95:38.28]I made it extinct.
[95:43.12]No, I already know what that is.
[95:50.48]I have to feed them red paint?
[95:54.40]What?
[95:58.60]I want to go on the ship.
[96:00.30]Alright, what are we going to...
[96:05.90]Find a random world.
[96:12.33]And stop.
[96:13.61]No.
[96:14.55]And stop.
[96:15.41]And stop.
[96:16.35]Yeah.
[96:16.77]This one.
[96:17.17]No.
[96:17.53]And stop.
[96:18.93]And stop.
[96:20.57]That one.
[96:29.69]It was a red frog over by the guy.
[96:34.68]Was there a red frog as I was getting in the boat?
[96:37.12]I think the game crashed.
[96:38.32]Nope.
[96:46.26]Three cent joke?
[96:47.34]No.
[96:49.14]This is just to relax and hang out for a few hours before, or a couple hours, whatever, before PAX.
[96:56.32]Double zero hit the world jackpot.
[96:59.63]We're going to Guacamole Island.
[97:09.79]But yes, now that everyone's here, the stream's been live for a couple hours.
[97:16.08]Yes, I will be at PAX East all weekend.
[97:17.80]If you're going to PAX East and see me on the floor, please do not hesitate to say hello.
[97:26.87]I'll be there all three days.
[97:27.83]Oh, this place is great.
[97:33.43]Oh, I love this place already.
[97:35.15]This is awesome.
[97:40.38]Let's discover this shit for a second here.
[97:43.78]Can't discover the sheep.
[97:45.82]Okay, that's fine.
[97:49.94]No stream tomorrow.
[97:50.60]There will be no stream tomorrow.
[97:52.38]I'm going to be in the middle of PAX East, so there will be no stream this weekend.
[97:57.02]On Friday.
[97:57.58]So no.
[97:59.56]I will be back on Tuesday, regularly scheduled.
[98:05.74]When is PAX West?
[98:06.56]Actually, I don't know.
[98:07.36]I forget.
[98:08.43]I forget.
[98:11.04]But I can drive around a tractor, which I'm very happy about.
[98:20.80]I can discover a little lamb.
[98:24.80]I guess not.
[98:28.76]Well, this game's actually pretty interesting if you want to give it the time, for sure.
[98:32.18]Alright, let's do a quest.
[98:40.49]There's a quest right here.
[98:41.57]Whoa, look at the little cat!
[98:43.43]Look at the kitty!
[98:45.81]I'm just trying to look at the fucking cat.
[98:48.67]And all of a sudden I get attacked by two zombies.
[98:51.81]Is this person, like, reading a book?
[98:53.23]She's, like, playing a fake violin.
[98:56.62]Do something!
[98:58.42]Which one of these... Please, crow, help me!
[99:01.50]Crow, please!
[99:04.68]Somebody do something!
[99:08.40]Which one of these animals will fight back?
[99:11.12]Who's the real animal friend?
[99:12.50]I really expected the bird.
[99:20.95]But, whatever.
[99:21.53]Can I do the quest now?
[99:24.15]Or did the lady die?
[99:28.03]No, she doesn't want to talk to me.
[99:29.41]That's great.
[99:33.23]Well.
[99:34.61]Alrighty.
[99:35.07]Let's go.
[99:44.10]This music is great.
[99:44.94]Yeah, music is good.
[99:53.83]What's down here?
[99:55.59]Oh, zombies.
[99:56.29]There's a chest over here.
[100:10.52]Alright, hold on.
[100:11.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[100:11.68]Wait, it's over here.
[100:14.30]I saw it.
[100:15.28]It's right there.
[100:20.93]Okay, we're good.
[100:21.63]We're good.
[100:24.23]So far, so good.
[100:26.39]Where's that chest?
[100:32.67]Come on.
[100:33.73]Where is it?
[100:34.13]It's like right over here somewhere.
[100:40.16]Over here?
[100:40.64]Where the fuck is it?
[100:41.34]Is it down even further?
[100:46.06]I don't think I can go down even further.
[100:50.40]Attack.
[100:54.69]Yeah, what does it want?
[100:55.75]I don't have any water or anything.
[101:03.25]I'm just gonna dig.
[101:06.95]I have the damn tool.
[101:07.99]Like, might as well use the damn thing, right?
[101:13.75]Alright.
[101:15.51]So it's like here somewhere.
[101:20.88]Don't go far yet.
[101:22.14]I still need you.
[101:24.92]Where the fuck is this thing?
[101:48.56]Am I doing this right?
[101:49.80]Like, is it just in here somewhere?
[102:00.38]Where did my character just go?
[102:05.38]The beam is the treasure indicator.
[102:06.92]Okay.
[102:07.50]So that means it's down?
[102:08.82]I just have to keep going down.
[102:17.81]Where did my character go?
[102:18.75]I'm no longer in the world.
[102:29.14]Can anybody see my guy?
[102:30.06]I don't exist.
[102:35.60]I am the beam right now.
[102:46.24]I don't want to delete the chest accidentally.
[102:48.02]It just is deeper, okay.
[102:50.38]Alright, where am I?
[102:52.94]How did I fucking end up here?
[102:54.04]I can do that.
[102:59.84]Forgot.
[103:06.28]Do any of us truly exist?
[103:12.45]Let's get it out again.
[103:21.72]Alright, somebody tell me in the chat, like, is this actually what I need to be doing?
[103:28.30]Do I just have to keep going down to where the indicator is?
[103:30.56]Because, I mean, if I'm not doing this right, then I won't do it.
[103:40.51]I just have to keep going down.
[103:54.03]It's way down at the bottom?
[103:55.37]Really?
[103:55.73]Damn.
[103:56.33]Okay.
[103:59.11]How the fuck am I gonna get back up?
[104:06.75]Oh, shit.
[104:07.20]Is that it right there?
[104:07.80]Okay, I gotta be careful here.
[104:11.10]It looks like it's, like, right there.
[104:13.08]Hold on.
[104:14.52]I'm gonna put this away.
[104:15.68]I'm gonna go for a jump.
[104:21.22]Alright, nice.
[104:21.98]It's not right here.
[104:23.22]It's right here.
[104:25.46]Wow!
[104:26.08]That's so... That is so hidden.
[104:28.38]Holy shit.
[104:30.74]Oh, I got it.
[104:31.20]Okay.
[104:31.56]No need to dig.
[104:36.77]What's in it?
[104:45.53]What is that?
[104:47.73]Oh, I got a weapon.
[104:50.43]I have a trident now.
[104:52.71]Now no one's gonna be able to fuck with me.
[104:53.89]This is perfect.
[104:54.43]Alright, cool.
[104:58.90]Now, how do I get back up?
[105:03.34]That's how.
[105:06.96]I'm just climbing on the side of a giant, like, building right now.
[105:13.78]Why am I playing a Lego game?
[105:16.95]I don't know.
[105:17.58]It released out of early access and I was like, what the hell is this?
[105:23.26]And the plan for tonight was a fairly short stream.
[105:25.60]Because like I said, I'm going to PAX and I need to get prepared.
[105:31.21]I'm staying in a hotel because I don't want to drive back and forth from where I live now.
[105:38.93]It's a real pain in the ass.
[105:42.98]Especially if I'm gonna be drinking and stuff, I like to stay, like, in, like, in, in, deep in the city, you know what I mean?
[105:53.83]R.I.P.
[105:54.23]the cow.
[105:56.49]He'll find his way out.
[105:57.39]Alright, I got a weapon.
[105:59.55]Why is it blinking?
[106:11.21]That was not worth it.
[106:12.53]That was not worth it at all.
[106:19.55]Get away from me!
[106:34.38]What the fuck?
[106:39.84]I need to build a house.
[106:40.76]That's it.
[106:41.63]That's it.
[106:42.83]I'm building a house.
[106:47.69]Did I discover that?
[106:48.49]I don't think I discovered it.
[106:57.31]God.
[106:57.67]Alright, yeah, you killed me.
[107:01.23]Nice work.
[107:02.31]Did I discover that?
[107:03.23]I don't think I did.
[107:11.02]No, I didn't.
[107:13.02]I didn't think I was going to need to.
[107:18.86]God damn it.
[107:23.84]Well, do I actually still have it?
[107:25.92]If I still have it, then hell yeah.
[107:34.74]Oh, yes, I have it.
[107:36.26]Nice.
[107:37.68]The whole world isn't ending.
[107:40.94]Time to build a house.
[107:43.42]The house is going to be a piece of shit, by the way.
[107:45.24]If anybody was wondering, it is not going to be good.
[107:52.19]I'm sorry, hold on.
[107:55.81]I was trying to, like, snipe this guy with the trident.
[107:59.56]Why would I do it?
[108:00.34]I haven't built anything yet.
[108:01.68]That's shit.
[108:07.13]I'm sorry.
[108:07.71]No.
[108:08.49]Let's build a house before I stop streaming.

[121:02.96]They love it.
[121:05.68]Alright, cat, don't move.
[121:07.22]I'm going to get this butterfly one shot.
[121:10.66]Dammit.
[121:22.13]Not exactly doing a great job.
[121:27.43]See, if you guys had 3D glasses, that would have just gone... Look, if any of you guys have 3D glasses on.
[121:31.62]Alright, I'm going to paint the Sphinx and then that's it.
[121:37.37]This guy's fucked.
[121:39.35]No, this guy is fucked.
[121:41.41]Alright, here we go.
[121:47.79]Cow, you're gonna have to move out of the way.
[121:50.18]I need to Marvel at this.
[121:51.36]And where's my paint tool?
[121:55.68]They call him One-Shot Jerma.
[121:57.52]They do.
[121:59.20]What is that called?
[122:00.44]It comes from my extensive skills in every game.
[122:07.31]No, I don't.
[122:07.81]You don't even know me.
[122:08.81]You don't even know me.
[122:10.00]I'm good at a lot.
[122:10.54]I'm good at every game.
[122:12.54]What color is the Sphinx?
[122:13.40]Blue?
[122:18.48]When you go to the... Guys, listen.
[122:20.34]When you go to the Sphinx, it's somewhere in Indiana.
[122:23.42]You'll be able to see the bright blue.
[122:28.49]I'm slowly falling again, by the way.
[122:32.71]This is not... That's not...
[122:41.77]Why did I make it transparent?
[122:44.33]There you go.
[122:45.23]There's the finished product.
[122:47.90]The water sphinx.
[122:50.52]And somehow panels got deleted.
[122:53.14]I didn't delete those.
[122:55.72]What is in the sky?
[122:56.70]Did I put those up there?
[123:00.66]I don't think so.
[123:04.73]What's happening to my sphinx?
[123:08.66]Wait, why is this... Why is this wet?
[123:14.32]I don't understand what happened here.
[123:18.54]No, I think I made it... Yeah, I made it water.
[123:22.17]It's just... Did I?
[123:23.31]Oh, my last dying wish.
[123:27.11]Is to drown in the Sphinx leg.
[123:29.07]That's all I want.
[123:39.46]Can I just stand in it and drown?
[123:41.90]I don't think I can.
[123:44.58]This is fucking ridiculous.
[123:45.83]Alright, well... That's just weird.
[123:56.21]Well, now what do I do?
[124:00.59]You spraying silly string?
[124:02.59]How can water be wet?
[124:04.99]Well, let me... Actually, I'm curious now.
[124:06.93]Paint tool.
[124:09.08]I'm river, water, grass, mud, stone, wood, light stone, Darkwood, sand.
[124:17.48]What happens if I do mud?
[124:22.11]Can I bring this back to life by spraying it as mud?
[124:24.29]I don't think I can.
[124:30.35]This is just forever ruined.
[124:31.73]Well, there's your water's fix.
[124:34.80]Tried.
[124:36.02]Why is water wet?
[124:37.22]Why is water wet?
[124:38.20]I don't know.
[124:38.66]Can I paint it grass?
[124:42.35]I thought that... Okay, this is paint.
[124:45.29]I didn't know that.
[124:48.05]This is just forever ruined.
[124:49.15]Brushes?
[124:49.59]Let's do... You know what?
[124:51.69]I'm gonna move over here.
[124:54.40]I can't change it back from water.
[124:57.20]One of these little fucking gremlins stole one of my things and now it's gonna play the cartoon music.
[125:05.46]I could care less.
[125:06.16]You know, he's just... He's just gone.
[125:08.00]No, he's right here.
[125:10.30]I gotta show you guys why I was able to be, like, called number one.
[125:13.10]I got the blue ribbon for aim.
[125:20.97]This thing's range is so bad.
[125:27.01]Come on, and... Come on, I gotta show people why I got the blue ribbon.
[125:34.99]Yeah, I'm clicking right now and he just doesn't want to throw it.
[125:38.59]He just wants to throw it like those... Alright, good toss.
[125:42.12]No, you threw it at yourself.
[125:48.02]Why did he throw it that far?
[125:49.30]He threw it so far!
[125:55.56]I promise you guys, this is way more difficult than it looks.
[126:05.22]I swear to God, like, please trust me on this.
[126:07.88]This is not possible.
[126:10.52]Like, I have to click to... Why am I aiming this way?
[126:21.87]No!
[126:26.13]There's no... You can't do that.
[126:29.74]I'm clicking and holding.
[126:31.44]And he doesn't want to do it.
[126:33.04]I swear to God.
[126:33.88]Go ahead.
[126:34.52]Let Gumby get away.
[126:35.36]Who gives a shit?
[126:35.90]That's not possible.
[126:37.66]That's not possible.
[126:38.64]There's no way.
[126:39.10]There's no way.
[126:39.62]Nobody can do that.
[126:41.72]Nobody can do that.
[126:42.58]I'm certain.
[126:43.40]That's what I was trying to do.
[126:46.01]Look, okay.
[126:48.25]I'm... I have to... Holding the mouse button down means you have to walk.
[126:53.84]Look, guys, you need to understand the controls before you start calling me a fucking idiot.
[126:57.80]Because I can't, I have to hold W. Alright, somebody clipped themselves doing this.
[127:12.12]See, you won't let go.
[127:13.60]Let it go!
[127:17.22]Why did he throw it that far?
[127:20.40]No.
[127:21.16]You clip yourself doing that.
[127:22.40]Somebody do that.
[127:25.83]I will give you a picture of me on Twitter.
[127:30.59]If somebody clips that and sends that to me, somebody hitting this guy with the fucking trident, I will just take a fucking Twitter image of me.
[127:37.22]I don't even know.
[127:38.60]I was going to say something really fucking stupid right there, and I'm glad I didn't.
[127:46.25]I'll put a picture of me on Twitter at some point in my life.
[127:48.43]There you go.
[127:51.57]Can't you trap it with... Now, stay right there.
[127:53.91]I'll get it right now.
[127:54.67]Watch.
[127:55.37]I post pictures of you all the time, so you don't even need to.
[128:02.33]Let me, like, get this down.
[128:03.38]Because I don't, like, understand what this is.
[128:05.60]I have to click to move.
[128:10.38]Do you know what I mean?
[128:10.98]Like, I have to click this fucking dumb button to move.
[128:15.68]I'm gonna hit this guy.
[128:16.42]I don't give a shit if it takes me all day.
[128:24.81]Alright.
[128:25.17]So clicking walks forward.
[128:27.01]So if I'm holding down... Nope.
[128:40.26]I don't know.
[128:40.96]There's no way.
[128:45.51]Nope.
[128:46.41]Nope.
[128:48.35]This is a 20,000 hour trident stream.
[128:51.79]Use F to throw instead.
[128:52.91]Alright, we'll try that.
[128:56.55]Use the boat.
[128:58.73]Use F. Why the fuck would you ever have F be like that?
[129:05.60]Come on, really.
[129:15.23]I got him.
[129:17.14]You can't say I didn't get him.
[129:19.78]He disappeared.
[129:20.78]That went right through his head.
[129:21.71]Did you see that?
[129:23.11]Yep.
[129:24.13]That went right through his head.
[129:26.79]What is this?
[129:35.90]Why is holding... Okay, right now, guys, I am holding down F and, like, right-click.
[129:42.53]Let's try it on this goat.
[129:44.85]Okay, you saw that.
[129:45.65]Everybody saw that.
[129:46.19]I want to make sure you all saw that.
[129:49.03]Aiming at the goat.
[129:56.76]I'm sorry, goat.
[129:57.58]I'm sorry.
[129:58.94]I'm sorry.
[130:02.52]He's gonna kill me.
[130:03.66]He's like, he wants to talk about carrots.
[130:07.44]That's all he wants to do.
[130:08.20]I hit this goat in the face with the trident.
[130:10.74]He's like, hey, have you ever heard about a carrot before?
[130:12.44]Alright, I'm kind of sick of this shit right now.
[130:16.84]I really don't want to have to do this, but, you know, sometimes you're getting chased and it's annoying.
[130:22.71]And you have to turn around and 180 throw a headshot at a goat.
[130:35.74]It's not very accurate.
[130:47.20]Is he dead?
[130:47.66]Now quick, discover him.
[130:52.59]Get out of here, quick.
[130:57.03]Really?
[130:57.97]Really?
[130:58.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[130:59.63]There's a carrot!
[131:00.13]Dude, you and I are best friends now.
[131:06.02]Yeah.
[131:06.83]Nice.
[131:09.15]He just shit out a ton of money.
[131:11.05]Nice.
[131:11.33]Good job.
[131:19.70]What the fuck have I been doing in this game?
[131:21.62]Like, I'm supposed to be building.
[131:22.88]Actually, I did build this thing.
[131:24.18]I'm okay.
[131:26.44]I'm gonna go to a different world, though.
[131:30.75]I think somebody needed that and I just ruined it.
[131:32.79]Oh well.
[131:34.19]Now I can discover this motherfucker.
[131:35.59]Let's go.
[131:36.01]Get discovered.
[131:38.55]You beautiful little sheep.
[131:40.31]You and I are now best friends.
[131:43.40]There we go.
[131:44.64]Cool.
[131:46.66]Very cool.
[131:49.70]Okay.
[131:53.26]Now I can discover it.
[131:55.16]I guess if you are nice and you give them what they want, then you can make them your friend and discover them.
[132:01.14]It's a sandbox, do whatever the hell you want.
[132:02.46]That's true, yeah.
[132:05.24]Well, this has kept my attention for this long.
[132:07.98]As much as I've just been kind of dicking around.
[132:10.25]That Sphinx was terrible.
[132:11.29]Wait a minute, is he following me?
[132:14.79]Oh, he really is.
[132:15.93]Can he come with me?
[132:18.43]That pig wants shit.
[132:20.97]I don't have shit for him.
[132:24.96]Sorry, pig.
[132:29.36]He's just my friend.
[132:30.88]By the way, this is the same goat that I threw a trident at his head.
[132:34.56]So, I'm not sure why we're friends.
[132:37.57]Oh, we got a loot box.
[132:39.17]Really?
[132:39.45]What happened up there?
[132:46.09]Put it back in the holster.
[132:48.95]I want to see, like, one more world.
[132:51.22]And we'll go from there.
[132:56.21]Who would have guessed that being nice to someone and giving them what they want makes them your friend?
[132:58.99]I know.
[132:59.31]Lily, come in the... Alright, hold on.
[133:02.29]Let's see if I can... You gotta... Get away from me!
[133:08.35]This is dangerous!
[133:09.97]This is dangerous!
[133:16.51]This is... Goat, I'm telling you right now, you don't want to be doing this.
[133:22.75]I don't want to, like, run him over.
[133:26.91]Daddy has work to do.
[133:32.09]Daddy has some work to do.
[133:42.71]Part of me was hoping the goat was going to just go right by me.
[133:47.15]God damn it.
[133:47.73]There was your 200.
[133:48.13]Oh, he's right here.
[133:50.77]That was your $250 joke that didn't happen.
[133:53.55]I was hoping I was going to marry Poppins and we were going to watch him jump off the cliff.
[133:57.62]We're going to try that again just because... Hey, Mackerel.
[134:01.16]Mackerel, here's your $5,000 joke.
[134:04.94]I'm going to do marry Poppins and he's going to fall right by us.
[134:10.19]How do I marry Poppins again?
[134:12.77]Is it F?
[134:13.23]I think it's F.
[134:21.32]It's E. He didn't jump.
[134:26.84]Yeah, he's just gonna wait for me, isn't he?
[134:28.34]He doesn't jump off.
[134:29.00]He's too smart.
[134:29.62]Yeah, he's on the edge.
[134:33.58]Where is he?
[134:35.38]There he is!
[134:36.73]Come on!
[134:37.77]Come on!
[134:39.69]Jump, you little shit!
[134:42.25]Alright, back, but pay attention.
[134:46.33]The thing I just said, it didn't happen, so forget it.
[134:50.56]Give me five thousand dollars.
[134:52.18]I'm suing you alright.
[134:54.12]Can I do like a hit man where I like grab him?
[134:58.77]Alright, let's go Okay Alright, give me I'm gonna go back in the ship.

[135:20.28]I just... I can't even do quests.
[135:23.30]Can he fight?
[135:25.20]He actually can fight.
[135:30.38]He's dead.
[135:31.62]He's dead.
[135:32.72]He fought a very... He fought a very long... He fought a good fight.
[135:38.10]You did good for Dad.
[135:40.23]Thanks.
[135:42.39]You were sacrificed.
[135:43.99]Apparently.
[135:46.57]Oh, lag.
[135:49.58]Jump off the cliff while riding it?
[135:50.94]No, that's deliberate mean.
[135:53.24]I was trying to be passive mean.
[135:54.56]Alright, where's my ship?
[135:56.98]Let's go see another world.
[135:58.44]We'll do one more and then I gotta get ready for PAX.
[136:01.28]So we'll see another world.
[136:02.12]He was my only friend.
[136:04.56]He really was my only friend, you're right.
[136:08.87]Avenge him?
[136:09.79]You think I'm gonna avenge him?
[136:11.37]My guy's such a weak piece of crap.
[136:17.03]Just make a pit and fill it with rats.
[136:18.17]I promise I'll do that before I turn the stream off.
[136:34.69]I will use all my resources.
[136:35.93]Yeah, I want to see another world, though.
[136:40.02]There's plenty more to see.
[136:41.54]And there's also a chest down there, but who cares?
[136:46.74]Yeah, I'm coming.
[136:49.55]I just like, if a goat's not gonna... Can I not get in here?
[136:52.19]If a goat's not gonna, you know, help me out, I'm gonna have to be passive against him.
[136:57.05]Alright, where are we going?
[136:58.75]Random world?
[137:03.45]I want something different that we haven't seen yet.
[137:06.55]Like a snow world or something.
[137:10.98]These are all so boring.
[137:15.84]Demanding?
[137:16.38]This is like, come on.
[137:17.74]This game was $30.
[137:18.32]This wasn't no $5 game.
[137:23.10]This was $30.
[137:23.56]Wait, what about this land?
[137:25.47]No, it's... Could go to Candy Land, but we already saw Candy Land.
[137:34.62]These are just small areas, though.
[137:35.92]I need 80 to unlock that.
[137:37.98]I can't unlock these yet.
[137:41.66]The red lighthouse looks cool.
[137:43.26]Alright, we're just gonna... No.
[137:50.99]No.
[137:53.73]Alright.
[137:54.05]I don't think we've seen a sandy kind of beach place like this.
[137:57.73]Let's just go.
[138:00.77]I've got one map to keep going.
[138:05.47]So each one of these islands, these random islands, has those gold Legos on.
[138:12.17]So you do, there's missions and little things you can do to get those gold bricks.
[138:17.01]And when you have enough, you can keep going.
[138:19.89]You can make your own world when you have 100.
[138:24.13]So they expect you to play for quite a long time.
[138:28.37]Spawn rats until I crash.
[138:29.71]I'm going to... I promise.
[138:32.69]I fucking promise that before this stream ends, I will spawn rats until my computer breaks.
[138:40.31]I promise.
[138:43.58]Oh, on stream like that?
[138:45.36]I keep my fucking promises.
[138:46.82]You gotta believe that.
[138:50.31]Hey, wait, I've never promised to be on time.
[138:52.81]I've told you guys it's a soft 7.
[138:55.01]I was early.
[138:55.63]Hey, was I early or was I not early last spring?
[138:58.07]I was pretty early last spring.
[138:59.53]I was on time.
[139:00.33]I was exactly on time today.
[139:04.03]That guy scared me because I haven't heard him in like an hour.
[139:08.53]This is kind of hurting my eyes.
[139:11.55]It's bright as shit.
[139:13.57]Snakes.
[139:13.85]Alright, you guys want a pit of snakes?
[139:18.13]A pit of rats.
[139:20.54]Can I discover?
[139:21.04]Let's see what I can do.
[139:23.34]I can just write up a bad discovery.
[139:27.46]Dynamite crate.
[139:28.54]Really?
[139:30.43]Really?
[139:35.07]I do kind of like the concept of having to travel around and find things to unlock.
[139:43.21]You actually have to see it.
[139:45.63]That's pretty cool.
[139:47.89]I mean, it has to be rats, right?
[139:49.07]Why would it not be rats?
[139:51.39]It's like that you unlocked a terrorist quest or something like that on the screen.
[139:55.79]Yeah, where's my map?
[139:57.83]Usually this is... Oh, that's... Okay, okay.
[140:00.19]Yeah, see the minimap up here?
[140:01.19]And these beams?
[140:02.66]These beams are like quests and chests.
[140:05.80]So let's see if I can do anything here.
[140:12.16]Howdy, I want a new barn for my ranch.
[140:13.86]Will you lend a hand?
[140:14.72]Okay.
[140:18.10]So I gotta discover a barn.
[140:19.36]There's a chest over here.
[140:24.22]What's in the chest?
[140:24.80]Something good?
[140:29.34]I don't know.
[140:29.74]It's a barn.
[140:30.60]Okay, easy.
[140:31.20]I'm just gonna smash all of his shit for a little bit.
[140:37.51]It's just like currency.
[140:41.59]You can use it to, um... You have to, like, use it to unlock certain things, I think.
[140:46.35]Alright, let's build this guy's barn.
[140:54.13]Barn.
[140:55.01]2500.
[140:55.03]Where do you want it, buddy?
[140:58.43]Over here?
[141:03.83]I hope you don't mind your barn being, like, up here.
[141:05.84]I think you were supposed to build it right there.
[141:10.88]I was supposed- yeah.
[141:12.02]It's close enough.
[141:12.62]He's happy.
[141:14.68]He's happy.
[141:17.24]I got a hammer.
[141:20.44]Oh, dude, you don't give, don't, the number one rule, guys, don't give me a fucking melee weapon in a video game.
[141:27.41]It's just, it's not gonna end well for anyone.
[141:30.70]Except this guy's immune.
[141:32.16]Now I need a few water pumps and other ranch stuff to get me started.
[141:34.74]The objects that you need for this quest are definitely nearby.
[141:39.20]Okay.
[141:40.30]Have a good look for them.
[141:42.24]Look high.
[141:43.69]Look low.
[141:44.09]Does somebody actually have a snake emote?
[141:45.71]Look medium.
[141:46.87]Holy shit.
[141:47.75]They're usually hiding in plain sight.
[141:50.21]Alright, we've got to discover some random things.
[141:52.43]Yeah, there's one right here.
[141:55.31]Ah, discover this.
[141:56.93]Discover the other ones right here.
[141:58.42]And this guy needs 12?
[142:00.26]I think we already got it, right?
[142:03.22]Unlock the bolt.
[142:05.50]And unlock the... Ah, okay.
[142:07.65]What do you need?
[142:10.85]Two windmills, two troughs, and 12 of those bricks.
[142:15.82]Oh, hold on.
[142:21.94]I don't even care, you know what I mean?
[142:25.15]I really shouldn't care about this, but I'm going to bash this guy's fucking head in with a hammer.
[142:30.87]You know, I... I don't like... If you want to know part of the game, I don't like this.
[142:36.21]Chasing around the little Gumby people.
[142:38.93]To unlock stuff.
[142:41.01]I don't... Yeah, you don't have to, but... It's not completely necessary.
[142:46.68]But it's necessary enough to... I get this peace now, apparently.
[142:52.31]Or do I?
[142:52.67]Can I pick this up?
[142:58.00]There you go.
[143:02.84]I don't have any carrots.
[143:04.74]Oh, that's unfortunately not the same goat.
[143:06.52]That's a different goat.
[143:07.36]I wish it was.
[143:07.98]But hold on.
[143:08.94]We've got a battle... I wanted to watch that.
[143:12.93]Well, the winner gets its head smashed in.
[143:15.11]Congratulations.
[143:17.11]Should have discovered it first.
[143:18.27]Alright, let's do the barn thing.
[143:26.69]You're literally faster than just run.
[143:31.16]Yeah, but like... That's like... Really?
[143:38.98]What can I do?
[143:39.46]Why can't I carry around a snake?
[143:43.35]Just hold this at people?
[143:44.29]What if I go to the horse?
[143:52.19]Well, alright.
[143:53.17]Is the horse scared of the snake?
[143:57.96]Okay.
[143:58.96]Let me just build one of these and get this over with.
[144:05.98]Windmill pump.
[144:09.96]And 12 of those.
[144:11.26]Do I have those?
[144:13.36]I do, yeah.
[144:18.26]Haystack.
[144:18.84]Alright.
[144:21.92]What is that?
[144:22.30]Somebody's fighting.
[144:23.12]Did you guys hear that?
[144:26.43]Alright, the haystacks are going to go right here.
[144:28.07]Because, like, it's an even carriage right now.
[144:34.95]Did I win?
[144:40.84]Two more.
[144:42.70]What are you going to give me?
[144:46.86]A puzzle piece?
[144:49.46]He gave me a pretzel.
[144:54.45]That's it.
[144:56.25]I built this guy's whole ranch and he gave me a soft pretzel.
[144:59.68]Well...
[145:02.05]This character wants you to build a structure for them.
[145:05.37]You can fulfill their requirements by building something basic.
[145:09.23]But really, they'd like something magnificent.
[145:12.61]Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen.
[145:13.33]Something they can show off to their friends.
[145:15.85]Something they can have parties in.
[145:17.95]Something... Oh, you get the idea.
[145:19.84]This is not gonna happen.
[145:21.50]This ain't gonna happen.
[145:23.24]Alright, build the guy's house.
[145:25.48]Sure.
[145:27.50]We're gonna do this as basic as you can build a fucking house.
[145:33.20]Watch this.
[145:34.64]Yeah, for a pretzel.
[145:47.51]No.
[145:51.60]He just wanted a pretzel.
[146:01.40]Hey, look, a guy.
[146:02.10]I don't care.
[146:05.68]Run away with whatever the hell you have.
[146:08.04]This is where the barn was supposed to be.
[146:11.73]The genius architect is back.
[146:13.33]Yep.
[146:13.99]Yeah, you can taunt me over there all you want.
[146:16.81]I don't really care.
[146:19.69]This guy doesn't deserve a door.
[146:24.93]Is that good enough?
[146:29.24]Alright, well that's it.
[146:33.44]I'm done.
[146:35.50]There he goes.
[146:36.59]Hey, there you go.
[146:37.33]There's your house.
[146:39.85]It's not quite finished.
[146:40.77]Let me show you.
[146:48.59]Oh, he needs to be big?
[146:50.83]Oh, I don't want to do that.
[146:55.96]I don't want to do that shit.
[146:58.16]Not right now.
[146:58.76]This is gonna take ages.
[147:00.90]He wants it that high?
[147:02.06]Alright, fine.
[147:06.70]I'll do you a solid, my friend.
[147:09.21]I'll do you a solid.
[147:11.83]You want me to build your house for you, huh?
[147:14.23]Isn't that just great?
[147:18.33]Hope you like snakes.
[147:25.24]Is there a way, like, can I, like, is something like... Wait, wait, wait.
[147:28.58]Is he angry with me?
[147:31.06]Where's he going?
[147:31.48]He's getting on his horse.
[147:36.98]He's got... I think, I think he's gone.
[147:40.90]No, he's right over there.
[147:43.92]Uh, I think the snakes are fighting each other.
[147:45.64]Where'd they go?
[147:47.86]Where, why is he leaving?
[147:50.20]Oh, dude, this is... No, he's right there.
[147:52.06]Oh.
[147:53.26]It really is just a snake fight.
[148:00.22]Why are these things so useless?
[148:01.90]Do something.
[148:04.38]Fight each other.
[148:06.94]Bite somebody.
[148:09.28]Stop being so useless.
[148:10.54]You guys are like fucking... goofy animal balloons.
[148:14.90]Oh, fuck it.
[148:15.44]Alright, you know what we're doing.
[148:16.66]It's over.
[148:19.19]Uh, rats until the game breaks.
[148:22.32]That's right.
[148:24.84]Rats, we're digging a hole, like, 50 feet deep, and rats until the game can't, the game cannot work.
[148:30.92]Time for a rat hole.
[148:34.23]Yep.
[148:35.27]You know, sometimes, sometimes you understand when it's time to actually, you know, cause a problem.
[148:48.85]This has got to be clean, though.
[148:50.73]You know, this can't be like shitty looking.
[148:52.77]This has got to be a clean build.
[148:56.31]Already ruined it, but whatever.
[148:57.85]It's a fucking rat hole.
[148:58.89]Who cares?
[148:59.53]Alright, here we go.
[149:05.56]How do I get up?
[149:08.16]It's so dark in here.
[149:09.18]God, this ain't even going to work.
[149:16.80]Hold on.
[149:20.83]Alright, here's the brown rat.
[149:30.04]This is gonna take a long time.
[149:33.12]This is gonna take at least like five to ten minutes.
[149:37.23]Can I just hold the button down?
[149:38.17]No.
[149:40.87]Please don't tell me they fight each other.
[149:49.08]Let's just get in here so it takes, like... I don't have to sit there for, like, a minute.
[149:58.08]Dude, like, they're going into the walls.
[150:08.86]Are they actually disappearing?
[150:10.08]I can't even tell.
[150:10.66]I think they are, like, disappearing into the walls.
[150:19.49]Let's see.
[150:20.89]I'm going to follow this little troop right here and see where they go.
[150:24.25]They're all kind of migrating to the same spot.
[150:25.99]Where is it?
[150:28.05]Why are they doing it?
[150:36.52]No, are they all just kind of in the corner over here?
[150:40.10]This shit ain't even... I don't think this is going to work.
[150:42.04]Hole sucks.
[150:44.06]Need a new hole.
[150:47.02]Yeah.
[150:47.72]Wow.
[150:48.20]What a bust.
[150:50.99]I ain't giving up on this yet.
[150:55.02]If you think I'm going to give up, that's not the case.
[150:57.06]We're going to make a small hole.
[151:03.80]Landscape tool.
[151:09.29]Like that.
[151:09.81]That's okay.
[151:10.51]Now we'll see if we can really tell, right?
[151:15.97]Discovery tool.
[151:18.41]Rats.
[151:24.31]Are they actually disappearing?
[151:26.09]They're in the corner right now.
[151:29.15]These ones aren't.
[151:33.73]They're just like, they're trying to get to me.
[151:42.10]This is going to look like ants.
[151:46.16]Oh boy.
[151:46.62]Alright.
[151:46.98]This is going to work.
[151:47.78]Good.
[151:48.08]We're going to fill this hole.
[151:54.73]It's trying to jump out of the hole.
[152:00.31]Oh, God.
[152:00.97]Torches?
[152:04.23]Do I have?
[152:04.75]Oh, I do have torches.
[152:05.61]You're right.
[152:09.41]I feel like they're disappearing.
[152:11.54]No, I'm going to wait.
[152:12.20]I'm going to watch and wait for a second.
[152:19.06]Okay, when I shoot one, does one disappear?
[152:22.18]I don't know.
[152:26.33]Yeah.
[152:27.57]I think you can only have a certain amount before they start to fade out.
[152:30.41]Unfortunately.
[152:33.59]So, we'll do something else.
[152:34.71]I'm gonna make the candy building until the game breaks.
[152:40.80]Yeah, they're getting out.
[152:41.64]Unfortunately.
[152:42.34]Oh, well.
[152:43.38]It was worth a shot.
[152:45.62]It was worth a shot.
[152:46.54]Oh, well.
[152:46.80]It's okay, guys.
[152:48.74]We'll break the game in another way.
[152:56.62]We'll break the way, uh, you know, we'll just make a track.
[152:59.30]We'll just make a bunch of fucking tractors.
[153:03.98]Wow, how disappointing.
[153:07.09]You can't... I can't even make a tractor?
[153:12.59]Why not?
[153:13.09]I want to make a tractor.
[153:19.28]Jerma lies to us again.
[153:20.66]No!
[153:21.56]I'm trying.
[153:22.94]What about boats?
[153:23.60]Can I do boats?
[153:24.72]I can't do boats.
[153:26.87]What about people?
[153:31.39]Okay, I can do people.
[153:32.25]Free.
[153:32.55]This is going to be the scientist lady.
[153:36.74]Now she can get out.
[153:37.62]Oh my god.
[153:42.60]Maybe the scientist lady will build that freeloader's house.
[153:45.78]I know, really.
[153:50.42]That's it.
[153:51.89]I ain't taking this game's shit anymore.
[153:54.42]We're going... like, full.
[153:57.64]Like... DEFCON 70.
[154:01.53]The music just kicked in too, so that's a good thing.
[154:03.71]Here we go.
[154:07.89]Time for a fucking barn fest.
[154:11.63]No blending.
[154:12.41]Who gives a shit, right?
[154:13.23]What does that even mean?
[154:13.88]Oh, it's launching me a run.
[154:25.84]I don't even care.
[154:26.38]Like, how come it's taking so long to build each one?
[154:31.28]Where did that one even go?
[154:32.23]Snap the disk in half.
[154:35.69]No, we're going to the cosmos.
[154:39.79]Can already feel it a little bit.
[154:40.65]What happened last time?
[154:43.09]Remember the last time it was just building this shit out like crazy?
[154:45.81]Alright, we're doing the candy can house.
[154:51.47]By the way, this is gonna be probably where the stream ends.
[154:53.89]Just in case you guys are wondering, so... Uh, before, like, the whole everything dies... Copy tool.
[155:01.29]Alright, well we're just copying this mess and we're gonna paste it.
[155:03.80]Uh, okay, copy tool.
[155:12.70]I did use the copy tool for that though, that's the thing.
[155:19.69]Just this whole mess, who cares?
[155:22.50]Whatever we get.
[155:23.12]I don't even know.
[155:24.70]It's like half a house.
[155:29.47]It's not even a... Okay, that's not even a fucking house.
[155:33.91]Show a non... Replace bricks.
[155:36.53]Got it.
[155:36.85]New model 2.
[155:37.57]That's fine.
[155:38.85]Saving.
[155:39.25]Let's do it.
[155:39.79]It's just a candy cane.
[155:40.63]Okay.
[155:47.79]So how come... Did that work?
[155:55.71]No, it's just, like, doing this now.
[155:58.89]Copy the Brat Pit?
[156:02.95]No, just copy?
[156:03.89]I don't even know, like, what that even means.
[156:14.07]No, I don't think so.
[156:15.73]Now you need to copy.
[156:17.45]Now paste.
[156:18.07]I didn't do it right?
[156:20.06]Well, sorry.
[156:21.84]Sorry I'm not doing copy and paste five houses correctly.
[156:26.04]Just copy it, don't save.
[156:27.04]Well, actually, this is better because now I can do this.
[156:32.22]Copy tool.
[156:32.80]So you're talking about just do this?
[156:40.32]Okay, so it's copied.
[156:46.85]So now that's it.
[156:48.11]Just make icon, don't save it.
[156:50.11]Just back.
[156:51.55]Now how do I paste?
[156:54.17]They didn't teach me this.
[156:58.18]Like, edit and save, copy.
[157:00.72]Like, that's it.
[157:01.42]Okay.
[157:04.78]Oh god, okay, here we go.
[157:07.04]I just got the fucking candy cane, by the way.
[157:08.90]Alright, well, thanks everybody for watching.
[157:13.45]Because this is where it ends.
[157:22.91]I'm gonna, like, fry my video card.
[157:32.67]I need to, like, go up.
[157:38.86]How high can I go?
[157:39.68]Okay, I'll give this game a little bit of credit here, for real.
[157:47.06]This is still running okay.
[157:50.75]Now I'm gonna copy this.
[157:55.99]We're gonna copy this.
[157:59.25]Right here.
[158:00.79]Oh, Christ.
[158:02.74]Oh, it's breaking.
[158:03.62]I can feel it.
[158:05.24]It's trying so hard.
[158:09.28]Yeah, it is trying so desperately right now.
[158:16.60]It's not even getting it right.
[158:20.24]Somebody's like fighting me.
[158:24.64]Here comes the cartoon music.
[158:28.60]Dude, this is all fucked up.
[158:29.50]I don't even know where I am.
[158:31.98]I'm surprised I've been playing this game for this long.
[158:37.31]It's fun enough.
[158:42.37]Yeah, they wouldn't let me do it again for some reason.
[158:44.37]Copy tool.
[158:49.96]There we go.
[158:52.46]Oh god, it hurts.
[158:57.38]It hurts.
[158:58.82]Come on, do it.
[159:02.10]Oh, it's so fucked up.
[159:05.28]It's trying so hard to not let me do this.
[159:12.81]Oh, God, come on.
[159:18.49]Where is it?
[159:18.99]Where is my... Oh!
[159:20.69]Oh!
[159:22.25]Oh!
[159:24.54]Oh!
[159:32.38]Alright, yeah, this is it.
[159:33.06]This is where it ends.
[159:35.80]It's so high up right now.
[159:36.88]I don't even know where I am.
[159:42.92]Hold on, let me... Give me a second.
[159:45.68]You see, like, the artifact thing right now?
[159:47.24]My GPU actually might be, like, dying.
[159:50.04]Holy shit!
[159:54.04]What the fuck did I just make?
[159:57.64]Wow, and it still runs!
[159:58.93]This game still runs!
[160:04.57]Wow.
[160:06.30]Very unexpected.
[160:07.16]I can't believe this is still going on.
[160:13.04]This game can take a punishment.
[160:15.10]I will say that.
[160:21.03]Holy god, it's so high.
[160:24.21]And then I have to climb it?
[160:27.85]I'm not even sure I can put anything else down.
[160:30.41]No?
[160:30.63]Oh yeah, I can.
[160:33.52]Where's the skybox?
[160:41.84]Alright.
[160:42.86]Well, once we get to the skybox, this is it.
[160:50.04]I have still not dropped, like, any frames, by the way.
[160:54.58]For all the shit that somebody could talk about this game, the one thing that they can't talk shit about is the game's engine.
[160:59.96]Because, holy shit, is this still going.
[161:09.03]What is the limit?
[161:09.69]I don't know.
[161:10.87]We're gonna have to find that out, right?
[161:15.27]Is there a skybox in this game?
[161:20.02]It might go up forever.
[161:21.06]It really might.
[161:26.56]Holy shit.
[161:29.21]What?
[161:31.46]And then paint it water.
[161:34.84]I think we hit the limit.
[161:36.46]I think that's it.
[161:40.84]Yeah, we... Ooh!
[161:43.20]That doesn't look right.
[161:44.48]No, it's still going.
[161:48.85]Now I can feel it.
[161:50.21]I can feel this.
[161:55.35]Okay.
[161:57.21]Okay.
[162:02.16]So, I'm currently controlling the character right now.
[162:07.62]But, don't ask me where that is.
[162:12.23]Because, like, hold on.
[162:14.33]Whoa!
[162:15.41]I'm right here.
[162:18.39]Oh, I have to climb it.
[162:19.91]I have to.
[162:25.44]Oh, this is so cool.
[162:27.11]Can I climb the whole thing, you think?
[162:28.35]That's gonna take like fucking 50 minutes.
[162:31.79]We'll see.
[162:32.55]Actually, I'm making some pretty good time here.
[162:37.07]I gotta get to the top of Rock Candy Mountain.
[162:39.86]That's what this is.
[162:43.18]Wow.
[162:45.28]Wow.
[162:46.38]Now copy and paste this whole thing.
[162:49.34]I have to get to the top of Rock Candy Mountain if I'm gonna copy and paste this whole thing.
[162:55.35]But hey, guys that made Lego World, good job.
[162:59.79]Because this shit is awesome.
[163:01.37]You know why this is awesome?
[163:02.25]Because if you made a server, let's just say you weren't a fucking idiot like me, right?
[163:08.06]If you weren't stupid, dumb shithead like me, right?
[163:11.70]You could make a scalable parkour map like this.
[163:19.14]And it could go this high.
[163:20.67]And you could really impress your friends.
[163:23.78]This is gonna be so awesome when I copy and paste this.
[163:26.86]Climb out of the way to the top and then spawn rats.
[163:34.55]And this is so much higher, like, I could just fall, right?
[163:38.07]I could do the thing that everybody did in Spider-Man 2.
[163:40.85]When you get to the top of the Empire State Building and you just dive off.
[163:43.17]And you just, it was so awesome.
[163:45.29]We're gonna get to relive that experience.
[163:46.85]How much higher do we have to go?
[163:47.71]Not that high.
[163:53.02]Yeah, it's starting to really take a toll.
[163:55.99]I love that there's random trees here, too.
[164:02.37]Look at this shit!
[164:03.83]Look at that!
[164:04.73]Okay, it really starts to chug when I look down.
[164:06.67]Not much.
[164:12.35]We're almost there.
[164:12.87]If the music is really helping, it really is.
[164:19.51]Just don't make a wrong turn and fall off.
[164:21.22]That would be bad.
[164:29.18]Oh, something broke.
[164:30.40]You... Where is this guy going to go?
[164:36.52]You got all the way up here?
[164:37.60]You have to finish climbing up to the top.
[164:40.91]I know, but like a cheese monster appeared for no reason.
[164:43.47]And like that's kind of important.
[164:44.77]I want to see him fall.
[164:46.49]Right?
[164:46.75]I mean, don't you want to see him fall?
[164:48.45]Yeah.
[164:55.78]I don't think he can fall off.
[164:59.44]Oh, fuck this guy.
[165:02.04]I love how that guy got up here quicker than me.
[165:03.54]He almost was taunting me about it.
[165:04.68]Here we are.
[165:06.32]We've made it to the top of Rock Candy Mountain.
[165:09.82]Not yet, not yet.
[165:10.46]We have to think of something to do up here.
[165:12.17]Almost just fell off anyways.
[165:19.30]Alright, where's my screenshot?
[165:23.68]That's so cool.
[165:26.20]Alright, what do I do up here?
[165:27.22]Should I spawn something?
[165:28.04]What can I spawn up here?
[165:30.33]Um... No, it can't even go up here.
[165:37.31]It is way too high.
[165:38.37]Okay.
[165:39.87]Uh... Spawn a scientist.
[165:54.43]Good luck.
[165:57.09]Oh, you're so dead.
[165:59.65]You are so dead.
[166:02.61]Right?
[166:03.35]There's no way you survive this.
[166:10.60]I need to see you fall.
[166:13.40]Just fall.
[166:14.94]You're laughing at me.
[166:15.90]Just fall off.
[166:20.26]She finds it amusing.
[166:22.88]Goat buddy?
[166:23.64]Oh, hold on a
[166:27.14]How do you know what to do here?
[166:29.80]How do you know how to get down?
[166:31.26]That's fucking crazy.
[166:33.46]She's even jumping.
[166:37.19]Well, good luck, scientist, because now you're going to get tridents thrown at you.
[166:41.55]Have fun.
[166:43.13]Now I know how to hold F. I'm going to fucking fall off.
[166:50.86]No, it's too steep.
[166:53.80]I'm going to keep hitting that.
[166:57.34]Put this away.
[166:57.76]Alright, we're going for a jump here.
[167:04.77]Actually, let me try.
[167:05.51]I want to see what happens if I do this and the whole game breaks.
[167:09.49]Um... Can I... Oh, come on!
[167:18.38]Oh!
[167:19.56]Oh!
[167:21.70]Oh, boy.
[167:22.28]I can do it.
[167:24.84]Hold on.
[167:27.11]Hold on.
[167:28.07]Now get in it.
[167:28.53]Now get in the fucking tractor.
[167:32.57]I did it.
[167:33.37]This is what I wanted.
[167:35.19]I wanted this so bad.
[167:37.21]Come on.
[167:39.50]No.
[167:40.74]I want to drive off Rock Candy Mountain in the fucking tractor.
[167:46.02]Get... God damn it.
[167:48.68]This is seriously like a Mario Galaxy level.
[167:53.28]Oh, fine.
[167:53.72]Fuck it.
[167:54.28]I'll do another tractor.
[167:55.25]Who cares?
[167:58.14]That's all I wanted.
[167:59.02]Should I do it in a boat?
[168:05.28]I'm gonna do it in a rowboat.
[168:06.99]Can I, like, row off Rock Candy Mountain?
[168:09.57]If I put it, like, right there.
[168:10.71]Oh, please, Ellie.
[168:12.67]I could fucking row off this shit.
[168:15.69]Oh, I would laugh so hard.
[168:16.83]Come on.
[168:19.71]Something about the water today doesn't seem right.
[168:22.11]I'm not sure what it is.
[168:28.65]Come on.
[168:31.33]Oh, you're so close.
[168:32.71]You are so close.
[168:33.67]Just row off.
[168:36.09]Oh.
[168:36.23]Come on.
[168:39.18]You're right there.
[168:41.06]You're right there.
[168:41.72]Here we go.
[168:42.22]Rowing off.
[168:43.28]Here we go.
[168:45.20]He doesn't want to do it.
[168:46.40]Oh, he's his face.
[168:49.98]Oh, shit.
[168:50.62]I'm stuck.
[168:52.94]Oh, fuck.
[168:53.84]No, I'm not stuck.
[168:54.68]I'm like getting wedged in.
[168:57.50]Let me get Spider-Man out of there for a minute.
[169:02.31]Painted water.
[169:04.67]Just like that, guys.
[169:05.63]Look at his fucking Spider-Man moves.
[169:06.93]I'm just going back to the top.
[169:10.29]Okay.
[169:13.00]I'm gonna paint some of it water.
[169:14.32]That's a good idea.
[169:14.94]Uh, where's the paint tool?
[169:16.84]Right here.
[169:18.71]Paint tool.
[169:20.45]Uh, paint... Where am I going?
[169:25.01]Why did I do that?
[169:25.91]Alright, river water.
[169:27.31]Here we go.
[169:28.25]Just like here.
[169:34.85]That's not... That's not gonna work.
[169:38.90]No, alright.
[169:39.46]I'm done with that.
[169:40.48]No, I don't wanna... I wanna row off.
[169:43.19]And I want to land in front of, like, fucking a goat.
[169:45.79]Oh no, I'm stuck in here.
[169:47.53]No!
[169:49.00]No, fuck!
[169:49.94]Come on!
[169:51.38]Hold on, no, I can fight my way out.
[169:53.86]This is water.
[169:54.86]This is water I'm drowning.
[169:56.66]Who's the fucking smart aleck that made me do this?
[169:58.80]Alright, we're good.
[170:01.40]Alright, I have to row off.
[170:05.89]That's so important.
[170:06.73]I gotta row off the edge.
[170:08.99]Where's, like, the point of no return?
[170:10.57]Over here?
[170:12.32]Paint till crash.
[170:14.01]Now I have to row.
[170:14.79]Right there.
[170:16.11]If I could get that shit to balance right fucking here, this would be perfect.
[170:21.09]Alright, this is it.
[170:22.03]Come on.
[170:24.31]This is not how you're supposed to be.
[170:25.33]Okay, rowboat.
[170:27.45]Right.
[170:30.59]Don't fucking move.
[170:33.57]Okay.
[170:34.76]I think I can do it.
[170:36.10]Here we go.
[170:36.76]Hold your breath, everybody.
[170:38.10]We're going off that edge.
[170:44.34]There we go.
[170:46.26]Oh, God!
[170:47.06]Oh, God!
[170:48.58]I'm gonna land directly on my skull!
[170:54.83]It thought I was in water that whole time.
[170:57.29]Why?
[170:57.59]And we still... Did we make it all the way down?
[171:03.65]Yeah.
[171:04.11]Yeah, we did.
[171:06.25]Well, there we go.
[171:10.98]Perfect landing.
[171:13.44]10 out of 10.
[171:14.69]That was so fat.
[171:15.65]Oh, really?
[171:15.97]What am I?
[171:16.33]I'm like fucking 10,000 pounds.
[171:20.46]That was anticlimactic.
[171:21.66]Yeah, I was hoping my head was gonna cave in.
[171:23.39]Bird.
[171:24.47]Bird.
[171:24.73]Bird.
[171:24.99]Eagle.
[171:25.19]I can get on the eagle and get back up there quick.
[171:27.99]Come on.
[171:28.29]Come on.
[171:28.53]Please tell me that's what's gonna happen.
[171:29.45]Please.
[171:29.67]This will be the best game ever made.
[171:31.67]This is the best game ever made.
[171:32.67]Confirmed.
[171:34.93]We just confirmed it.
[171:35.69]This is the best video game to come out in the last, like, 50 years.
[171:40.37]I get a fucking bird that'll take me up.
[171:43.53]There it is.
[171:45.17]Come on.
[171:45.69]Fly up there, you little shit.
[171:48.85]Go, please.
[171:52.68]It was all just a dream.
[171:55.06]Yeah.
[171:55.48]Oh, wow.
[171:56.72]And then, good job, bird.
[171:59.15]How do I make you stay up here?
[172:02.87]This is fucking amazing.
[172:04.89]I'm so glad this exists.
[172:06.33]This is perfect.
[172:10.39]This is where the Lord of the Rings music goes.
[172:12.67]We can go even higher.
[172:14.21]What just exploded?
[172:15.29]What was that?
[172:15.71]Something just exploded.
[172:18.08]How high can I go?
[172:23.28]Is this... Can I go even higher?
[172:24.36]This is it.
[172:24.76]Alright, well, thank you, bird.
[172:27.20]You did a great job.
[172:28.34]I don't know how to... Oh, wait.
[172:29.68]I can attack.
[172:31.32]Drop down.
[172:32.36]Fly with... Oh, space.
[172:35.71]This mount... How do I go down?
[172:39.37]Where's the go down?
[172:40.25]How do I descend?
[172:42.79]Up, flying, drop down.
[172:44.21]Drop down.
[172:44.95]How?
[172:47.89]There is no... I...
[172:52.76]Dismount.
[172:53.56]Yeah, dismount.
[172:54.06]I'm gonna jump off.
[172:55.18]Yeah, go ahead.
[172:55.86]I gotta discover the bird.
[172:56.68]Fuck.
[172:57.24]Okay, hold on.
[172:58.88]Feed the bird a rat.
[173:00.24]Dismount.
[173:00.82]No, I'll die if I dismount.
[173:03.92]Left control.
[173:04.96]Oh, somebody, you're a hero, whoever said that.
[173:10.58]Okay, land.
[173:11.14]I gotta make this guy stick around.
[173:14.73]Okay, here we go.
[173:16.35]I'm gonna feed him a rat.
[173:19.03]No, he wants a fish.
[173:20.07]Shit.
[173:20.53]Do I have any fish?
[173:22.65]Uh, hold on.
[173:23.19]I discovered a fish, didn't I?
[173:25.03]Please just stay here and be my friend.
[173:27.21]Fish?
[173:28.29]Fuck, no.
[173:29.61]Wait, have a rat instead.
[173:33.28]Eat a rat instead.
[173:33.78]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[173:36.24]Fine, if I can't have you, nobody can.
[173:38.90]If I can't have you, then no one can!
[173:42.02]Fuck, he's getting away.
[173:48.08]Damn it.
[173:50.36]If I can't have you, then nobody can.
[173:52.78]Oh, easy.
[174:00.91]Easy.
[174:03.37]Why is that not doing that?
[174:04.23]Come on.
[174:05.27]Fucking kill the bird.
[174:07.30]Shit.
[174:09.62]He's dead.
[174:10.70]Oh, no.
[174:12.24]Oh, no.
[174:12.42]I made an enemy.
[174:14.72]Weak throat.
[174:17.78]Okay, honest to God, like, why is this happening now?
[174:19.94]Why do I have such weak arms?
[174:22.62]He's so majestic.
[174:25.33]Okay, he can leave.
[174:26.17]Whatever.
[174:26.53]He did his job.
[174:30.19]Now what do I do up here?
[174:33.37]I have a fish.
[174:34.71]Are you serious?
[174:36.99]Oh, you want to do it?
[174:41.73]Now I have a fish.
[174:42.37]I have a pretzel.
[174:42.97]We'll eat a pretzel.
[174:48.32]No, he's gone.
[174:49.72]He's gone.
[174:50.10]There he goes.
[174:52.12]Alright, um... There's still a robot up here.
[175:02.87]Alright, can I just have a bunch of rats in a boat with me?
[175:05.63]Alright, here we go.
[175:09.60]This is your last... Wait, do I have another vehicle that's better than this?
[175:15.62]What do I have for vehicles?
[175:17.11]I have a small digger.
[175:24.01]I'll brick you in your face for $5.
[175:28.87]Mary Poppins off the top?
[175:29.99]I could do that.
[175:33.83]Toss the rat?
[175:35.51]No, if I'm gonna toss anything, it's gonna be... Like, hold on.
[175:42.63]What about a pig?
[175:44.49]What happens if I just put a bunch of pigs up here?
[175:50.99]I wonder if the pig will go in the... Can it, like, fit in there?
[175:53.17]I have, like, one rat friend in there.
[175:54.57]No, we're just gonna have to fill it with rats.
[175:57.46]Alright, this is it.
[175:58.88]Stream's over after this, by the way.
[176:01.56]We're done here.
[176:05.90]Come on, get in there.
[176:06.94]That guy has such a fucking shit-eating grin on his face.
[176:12.14]No, it's just me and my one rat friend.
[176:15.04]That's it.
[176:18.68]That's it.
[176:20.10]Just me and my friend.
[176:23.41]Wish us luck.
[176:27.31]So everybody, I hope you enjoyed the stream.
[176:30.57]Let's see what happens to the rat.
[176:33.37]He's already gone.
[176:35.63]I don't know where the hell he went.
[176:41.59]I love how I'm still just spinning around.
[176:44.71]Take the pig.
[176:45.49]We're going for it.
[176:52.18]Okay.
[176:52.88]Here we go.
[176:53.62]This is it.
[176:54.62]Can I do this?
[176:57.52]Good luck, everybody.
[177:02.51]Oh, the game's crashing.
[177:03.93]It just... Yeah, we're done.
[177:05.83]The game crashed.
[177:06.67]It's over.
[177:08.15]Game crashed.
[177:10.86]I just, like, selected Rock Candy Mountain and the game crashed.
[177:16.19]Well, alright.
[177:18.17]That was it.
[177:21.12]I said I was going to do that until the game crashed and the game crashed.
[177:24.16]So...
[177:26.78]I'm going to take this opportunity to say my goodbyes.
[177:29.69]Sorry.
[177:31.95]But, yeah.
[177:33.75]No stream tomorrow.
[177:34.91]I'm going to be at PAX East for the weekend, the whole weekend.
[177:38.43]So if you're there, say hello, please.
[177:41.05]I'll be doing a meetup.
[177:42.54]Some point, just follow my Twitter.
[177:44.80]It'll be either Saturday or Sunday.
[177:47.16]So I'll let you guys know.
[177:48.36]Yeah, come say hello.
[177:49.60]We'll be walking around.
[177:51.04]We'll be doing things.
[177:52.51]We'll be doing all kinds of things.
[177:54.61]So if you're going, cool.
[177:57.02]Have fun.
[177:57.86]If not, then I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[177:59.22]And much love.
[178:01.67]Good night.
[178:17.92]Oh, and Dr. Jensen, thank you for the 1,400 bits, by the way.
