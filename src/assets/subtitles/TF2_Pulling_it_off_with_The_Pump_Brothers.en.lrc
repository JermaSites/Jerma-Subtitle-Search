[00:06.93]Can we play on the server now?
[00:10.16]Yeah.
[00:11.44]I told you I was fucking pumped up to do this shit.
[00:13.62]Yo, I'm pumped up right now.
[00:15.08]We're both pumped.
[00:15.86]Call us the Pump Brothers.
[00:17.02]You want to be the Pump Brothers?
[00:18.88]No.
[00:19.56]Yo, you don't want to be the Pump Brothers?
[00:22.32]I really don't.
[00:23.00]You don't want me to pump you up?
[00:24.31]You don't want me to pump you?
[00:25.27]I don't want you to pump me.
[00:30.77]I think I'm just going to spectate you.
[00:33.39]I'm gonna teach you how to pull it off, Star.
[00:34.95]You ready for this?
[00:35.43]I wanna see how to pull it off.
[00:36.55]Luigi, hee hee.
[00:37.75]Show me how to pull it off.
[00:38.49]No, first of all, you wanna jump... No, this is important.
[00:40.49]You wanna jump up on this rail?
[00:41.90]Jump up on these big, uh, spindy doodles.
[00:45.04]Once you get on the top spindy doodle, then it's really important that you wait here.
[00:48.26]There's just fly carcasses everywhere.
[00:49.88]Yeah, there it is.
[00:50.30]In that door.
[00:50.84]You don't wanna go in that door.
[00:52.18]Oh, yeah?
[00:53.12]Go to the spindy doodle.
[00:53.98]Go!
[00:54.32]Just go!
[00:54.76]This is... Hit something!
[01:01.16]Don't worry, I'll pull this off.
[01:02.24]You want to see how you pull it off?
[01:03.36]Time to turn it on.
[01:04.88]Turn it on.
[01:08.04]That's how you pull it off, this one.
[01:09.08]Oh my god, what a hip shot.
[01:11.22]Oh, wasn't even aiming for him.
[01:13.15]Wasn't even aiming for that guy.
[01:17.47]Oh, there's a sentry over here.
[01:19.11]Spy, you gotta do your work.
[01:20.09]Get in there and get that sentry.
[01:20.93]Get the health kit.
[01:21.55]I can't.
[01:22.03]There's a sentry right there.
[01:23.29]Are you stupid?
[01:26.52]Not as in the type of dream that you have that you didn't like, but as in the Soul Calibur 2 character.
[01:31.80]As in 3-3-B is a very good launcher.
[01:34.72]Does a lot of damage.
[01:35.46]I think 72 damage.
[01:36.99]Okay, we're going to watch you pull it off, man.
[01:38.23]I'm going to pull it off.
[01:39.93]It's just mini-centric.
[01:41.73]It doesn't count because there was a mini-centric.
[01:43.69]Didn't pull it off.
[01:45.05]No, redo.
[01:45.85]Alright, fine, redo.
[01:48.33]You get one more shot to pull it off.
[01:49.81]Okay, I'm going to pull it off.
[01:55.05]Ready?
[01:55.50]This time the Mini Sentry won't get me.
[01:58.32]Alright, looks like he's gonna see a Demoman around the corner.
[02:00.70]No, no, here's what we're gonna do.
[02:01.66]We're gonna go... It didn't pull it off again!
[02:04.61]It doesn't count either, because he's the guy who builds Mini Sentry.
[02:09.73]This is your final chance to pull it off.
[02:14.30]Dude, I am just not pulling it off right now.
[02:17.32]You have a chance, right?
[02:18.14]No.
[02:19.10]You are just not pulling it off.
[02:21.86]No, it does.
[02:23.06]It does.
[02:23.62]That was three.
[02:24.74]No, it's my turn to pull it off.
[02:26.56]No, it's three strikes.
[02:27.63]You're out.
[02:28.31]Yeah, you're on strike four right now.
[02:29.83]I'm pulling it off.
[02:30.45]The first one didn't count because it was a mini sentry.
[02:32.61]That's fine.
[02:33.77]I'm pulling it off.
[02:35.05]I don't care.
[02:35.43]I'm not watching you because I'm about to pull it off.
[02:37.17]No, that's fine.
[02:38.17]I'm pulling it off before you pull it off.
[02:40.15]There's no way you're going to be able to pull it off.
[02:41.73]Oh, really?
[02:42.30]You think so?
[02:43.33]I think so.
[02:43.85]Go for it.
[02:44.21]I'm going for the sentries.
[02:45.07]If you pull it off before I pull it off... If you pull it off before I pull it off before you pull it off, then there's going to be a big problem here.
[02:52.72]No, no, no, no.
[02:53.24]Don't let him... Yeah, shoot him heavy.
[02:55.14]I... I... There's two... I... I didn't pull it off.
[02:59.22]This is... This is like the worst I've played in my life.
[03:02.48]I didn't pull it off either.
[03:04.64]There's 13 seconds left to pull it off.
[03:06.21]I mean, come on.
[03:07.01]One of us is going to pull it off.
[03:08.23]Somebody... Okay, I'm going demo.
[03:09.43]Somebody has to really pull this off.
[03:10.91]I...
[03:12.52]There's no time to get over here to pull it off.
[03:14.30]Come on, you gotta pull it off.
[03:15.96]I could pull it off if I had another minute.
[03:17.93]This is the line.
[03:21.31]Okay, what's the line up here?
[03:22.71]What are we looking at?
[03:24.13]Punch heavies.
[03:25.69]Both of us?
[03:26.51]Yes.
[03:29.57]You know we're gonna meet?
[03:30.24]We have a specific meeting point.
[03:33.22]No bullshit.
[03:34.74]No trickery.
[03:35.50]No tomfoolery.
[03:38.02]Okay, no attacking each other.
[03:40.52]No bullshit.
[03:41.52]No tomfoolery.
[03:43.24]We just want a straight, punch-heavy fight.
[03:45.68]No bullshit.
[04:03.57]I think I found a way.
[04:09.27]Oh, are you typing to someone?
[04:11.27]I'm talking to MLC stuff.
[04:13.05]I wouldn't do that if I were you.
[04:16.99]Are you working with him?
[04:27.75]Yeah, I've been typing to this sniper.
[04:31.07]I'm like, just wait, he's gonna come.
[04:34.49]Have you?
[04:35.37]Yes.
[04:38.70]He was sitting here, like, just waiting, aiming down here this whole fucking time I've been typing.
[04:48.03]Can you pull it off?
[04:49.51]Yeah, I can pull it off.
[04:50.23]Just let me get the health.
[04:50.89]And we'll have our battle royale.
[04:53.37]Okay, you ready?
[04:55.51]Uh, wait, wait, wait.
[04:56.33]I'm not ready.
[04:57.61]Okay.
[04:58.45]I'm ready.
[04:59.37]Are you ready to have the actual battle royale?
[05:04.58]Okay, Battle Royale.
[05:05.54]Get that health.
[05:06.44]Shit!
[05:08.42]Shit!
[05:12.80]It's the same sniper!
[05:15.11]It is.
[05:17.45]That sniper almost got me again.
[05:18.87]He was waiting in a corner to Jurati.
[05:22.59]Are you, like, instructing him on everything?
[05:24.45]No, no.
[05:25.27]Seriously, have you heard me type?
[05:26.75]Alright, wait.
[05:31.44]Kill him.
[05:32.62]Oh my fucking god.
[05:34.64]He just gunned you down.
[05:35.72]He just crit me.
[05:36.22]He thought about it till you saw him think about it.
[05:40.50]Invisible Party.
[05:43.08]Ah, yes.
[05:43.68]Have you read Invisible Weekly today?
[05:45.22]I did.
[05:46.46]I didn't like the part where it said we were a bunch of chumps.
[05:49.90]Yeah.
[05:50.64]That part was not good.
[05:51.48]Invisible Weekly has been really going downhill.
[05:53.34]It used to be about articles, but now it's just about the naked ladies.
[05:57.51]I know.
[05:57.93]Always the invisible naked ladies now.
[05:59.59]Yeah, I know.
[06:00.29]You can't even see them.
[06:01.01]It doesn't make any sense.
[06:04.07]Stand over here, and I'm gonna decloak and shoot the sniper in the back, and we're both gonna cloak at the same time.
[06:10.31]Like, make it so we're just permanently invisible, so they have no idea where they're getting shot from.
[06:13.19]You know what I mean?
[06:14.75]Just keep annoying people?
[06:15.95]Just, like, shoot, like, see where the pyro is right now?
[06:18.16]Like, shoot him, and then just we're both invisible forever.
[06:20.26]And he's gonna be like, what the fuck?
[06:21.12]I'm gonna go to the other side of the map, so it's, like, both angles.
[06:23.96]Okay.
[06:25.24]I'm gonna climb up this rock.
[06:29.14]I'm gonna shoot this soldier.
[06:30.40]Okay.
[06:34.65]I'm gonna shoot the pyro.
[06:35.35]Alright, I hit that pyro.
[06:36.83]I mean, uh, that sniper.
[06:40.05]Alright, he's coming back.
[06:40.61]He's coming back.
[06:40.97]He's coming back.
[06:41.55]Are you invisible?
[06:42.63]Yeah.
[06:43.69]He has no idea what's going on.
[06:46.39]We're shooting this other sniper.
[06:47.15]He's coming up here.
[06:47.61]He's coming up here.
[06:48.50]He's checking everybody.
[06:50.44]See the sniper?
[06:51.08]Oh!
[06:51.36]He's shooting at me.
[06:52.26]Yep.
[06:52.54]I'm gonna distract him.
[06:53.94]Alright, I shot him.
[06:55.10]I'm gonna shoot him.
[06:57.22]Alright, you shoot him now.
[06:59.62]Alright, I'm gonna shoot him.
[07:01.91]I shot him, I shot him, I shot him.
[07:03.54]He ran back and spawned.
[07:08.04]I pulled it off.
