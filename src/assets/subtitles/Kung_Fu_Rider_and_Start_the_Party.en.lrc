[01:02.01]He looks fucking mad.
[01:05.65]I am.
[01:08.53]Very much so.
[01:10.15]I look like shit.
[01:10.73]I don't even care.
[01:19.76]I can't even.
[01:20.66]I can't even talk.
[01:21.62]I can't even think.
[01:25.44]Look, I'm going to give it to you real.
[01:27.70]No fucking around.
[01:29.04]No jokes aside.
[01:29.96]Whatever.
[01:34.26]I've got four devices.
[01:35.62]I've got a game capture device.
[01:37.56]I have the PlayStation 3.
[01:39.02]I've got the streaming software.
[01:41.08]I've got Twitch's ingest system.
[01:43.00]I've got my own computer problems.
[01:46.35]I've got to rely on four or five different companies to turn on the stream sometimes.
[01:54.27]It gets fucking annoying.
[01:55.65]When one piece of the puzzle doesn't want to work, the whole thing comes down.
[02:08.17]And it's so fucking annoying because I streamed Demon's Souls.
[02:13.92]Nothing changed.
[02:14.78]This whole setup is the same that you saw three days ago.
[02:18.87]Nothing changed.
[02:20.87]It just didn't fucking work.
[02:22.31]It just wouldn't fucking work.
[02:24.40]It don't make any sense.
[02:29.26]There's no logical explanation as to why the Elgato could not be recognized by my OBS.
[02:36.59]I streamed on it three days ago.
[02:40.07]In the same spot, nothing moved.
[02:42.92]It's right here.
[02:45.74]It's right there.
[02:47.48]I didn't move it.
[02:49.24]Nothing happened.
[03:03.41]I didn't do it.
[03:03.91]Give me a sec.
[03:13.46]It moved.
[03:14.06]No, it didn't move.
[03:24.74]Talk to the store manager.
[03:26.27]No, I want to talk to God.
[03:28.13]I want to speak to God.
[03:29.81]I want to ask Him.
[03:32.21]I want to ask God.
[03:34.58]God.
[03:34.88]Fucking ring me up.
[03:39.84]I want to ask God.
[03:41.39]God, look, I know you're like all powerful and shit, and I'm sure you're a nice guy, but like, why did my computer break and fuck up and like crash and shit?
[03:53.11]We played Demon's Souls three days ago on the same exact setup.
[03:56.95]On the exact same, nothing fucking changed.
[03:58.89]I didn't do anything.
[04:01.07]Like, God, get down here.
[04:10.94]And, like, we're, like, 40 minutes later.
[04:13.02]Windows Update decided to do a full-on feature update.
[04:19.63]It's like, goddammit, man.
[04:21.77]Like, why?
[04:22.75]It's my birthday in, like, 40 minutes.
[04:33.33]God's an IT guy?
[04:35.30]I don't even know.
[04:35.96]I don't know.
[04:39.23]But I'm telling you, I swear to God.
[04:42.61]I have a curse.
[04:44.49]Where anything I touch just fucking breaks.
[04:47.61]Everything I touch is... Electromagnetic devices just screw through my fingertips into whatever I'm touching.
[04:54.37]You know those devices that they use in the Ghostbusters when they take the fucking ectometer and they like... I'm gonna be off the charts if you put that near me.
[05:05.08]Alright, here we go.
[05:06.56]Let me just like, update people on Twitter that like, I'm back.
[05:09.45]No, of course I don't!
[05:12.23]Shhh!
[05:12.77]Sorry!
[05:16.29]Fuck me.
[05:17.67]Well, you're a man, aren't you, Toby?
[05:19.71]Just jump out and beat those guys up!
[05:21.80]What are you, nuts?
[05:23.48]We're completely outnumbered!
[05:25.02]This isn't a video game, you know?
[05:26.46]Then what'll we do?
[05:29.74]Let's see.
[05:30.12]We'll just have to split up.
[05:32.60]We can meet back at the mobile office.
[05:35.00]It'll be okay.
[05:36.32]We'll manage somehow.
[05:37.20]Listen to these two anime characters yell at each other.
[05:39.36]And Toby, you distract them.
[05:41.21]You called me boss?
[05:47.73]Okay.
[05:48.55]So remind me again.
[05:50.37]Why is the mafia trying to get us?
[05:52.84]Start game.
[05:53.36]I don't know how to play this game.
[05:54.62]I don't even know what this game is.
[05:58.99]For a second I thought that was me.
[06:01.79]We're gonna be Toby, I guess.
[06:03.03]Basic action.
[06:03.65]Here we go.
[06:03.95]Learn a bit... Main road area.
[06:09.98]I guess.
[06:13.96]Wire head.
[06:18.80]Quickly swing down the motion controller to dash forward and speed up.
[06:23.12]Dash to accelerate when you have slowed down.
[06:25.66]Point the motion controller to brake.
[06:26.78]Okay.
[06:27.50]It's down.
[06:31.13]So I'm gonna go like this.
[06:33.65]I'm dashing.
[06:34.13]Alright, that's quite a dash.
[06:37.69]Okay.
[06:40.42]Swing the motion controller left or right to steer.
[06:47.74]Doing well.
[06:49.96]Flick the motion controller up to jump.
[06:54.40]Alright.
[06:58.55]Easy enough.
[07:00.81]This guy has a long pole.
[07:03.38]So, press and hold the T button to bend backwards.
[07:06.64]That's how you- Jesus.
[07:08.40]Okay.
[07:14.76]I did it!
[07:15.26]Okay, good.
[07:16.62]End of tutorial.
[07:20.63]Roundhouse kick is move, the move button.
[07:26.93]This is gonna be so dumb.
[07:31.20]Power dash.
[07:32.04]Ha!
[07:35.97]Power dash.
[07:36.55]I don't know about that.
[07:42.83]That's not, that's not good.
[07:44.09]There we go.
[07:45.29]Okay.
[07:48.21]I have to do that apparently one more time.
[07:58.48]Free slide.
[08:00.19]Train all six of the main actions.
[08:01.47]Perform them all successfully.
[08:04.71]This dash.
[08:07.63]Jump.
[08:11.05]Power dash.
[08:12.69]Roundhouse kick.
[08:13.63]Alright.
[08:13.81]Alright, the power dash is a little finicky.
[08:19.84]There it is.
[08:21.16]Let's kick this guy.
[08:23.96]I think we're ready.
[08:32.11]There's some features for this.
[08:33.39]What do you mean features?
[08:35.02]Rules.
[08:35.60]Oh, god damn it.
[08:36.38]Go home.
[08:39.98]Learn the rules.
[08:41.48]Advanced action.
[08:42.44]Let's just go.
[08:47.98]Office chair.
[08:48.56]We'll be good as an office chair.
[08:51.02]Music.
[08:51.40]That's fine.
[08:51.84]Alright.
[08:53.11]Fine.
[08:53.59]Let's go.
[09:03.83]We need to get through Tiger Road.
[09:07.44]Let's do it.
[09:08.04]Go!
[09:08.18]Do I have to collect the rings like Sonic the Hedgehog?
[09:16.34]Right.
[09:18.26]Okay.
[09:19.78]How do I go faster?
[09:36.19]I don't think there is a faster yet.
[09:40.63]Oh, shit.
[09:43.51]Easy.
[09:43.75]I'm gonna jump.
[09:46.65]That was a terrible jump.
[09:51.65]Fuck.
[09:51.83]Super dashing.
[09:56.47]Am I hitting people?
[09:57.27]Am I fucking killing people?
[10:01.79]Alright.
[10:06.84]This looks like a mobile game.
[10:10.79]Okay, that was pretty dumb.
[10:15.97]I can grind on rail, are you serious?
[10:31.04]Excellent, excellent, excellent!
[10:35.23]I got a full bar here.
[10:42.60]Oh, shit, I'm going too fast.
[10:47.04]Whoa!
[10:48.06]How do I stay on?
[10:49.98]How do I stay on?
[10:51.00]I think I did it.
[10:59.68]I got a lot of bits to go through, too.
[11:03.26]I'm very, very angry right now.
[11:05.68]It's hard to calm down.
[11:07.36]Okay.
[11:07.60]Okay, good.
[11:36.83]That's fine.
[11:37.53]That's fine.
[11:42.47]It's hard to calm down.
[11:44.38]It is.
[11:44.68]I'm so mad.
[11:45.58]I'm so angry.
[11:48.66]My fucking anger cannot be held.
[11:50.54]You should have heard the shit I was saying.
[11:53.56]When that stream died and a Windows update happened and I couldn't do it.
[11:58.17]Oh, man.
[11:58.93]I said a lot of bad things.
[12:04.66]I was talking about throwing up on someone.
[12:08.04]I think I talked about shitting on somebody too.
[12:09.55]I don't know.
[12:10.77]I went nuts.
[12:13.15]How do you do that on speed?
[12:21.76]There we go.
[12:23.22]Oh shit!
[12:25.26]Can I like... I don't think I can die.
[12:32.80]There we go, alright, let's, come on.
[12:34.56]Keep it up.
[12:35.36]Ah, just pump through the microphone.
[12:45.61]Is this normal heroes?
[12:46.67]It looks like it.
[12:51.90]It's too powerful.
[12:53.58]No, not right now, one second.
[12:58.44]Here we go.
[12:58.68]I'm trying to jump, fuck.
[13:04.82]It's not physically possible to speedkill.
[13:11.07]Says you!
[13:11.55]That was very delayed.
[13:13.47]That was way too delayed.
[13:14.57]Come on, like, what happened?
[13:18.27]Can you jump when I fucking say to jump?
[13:22.08]You, like, wee wannabe.
[13:34.26]I'm awful.
[13:35.12]I'm using the PlayStation Move controller, the shittiest peripheral that's ever been invented.
[13:40.28]C. Alright, I got a C.
[14:04.69]These photos are making it worth it, by the way.
[14:17.16]It's like the same fucking dead face.
[14:24.03]Looks like I'm running a toy.
[14:29.63]You want some ice cream?
[14:34.45]Alright, let's go.
[14:39.35]Oh, I hope Karen will be alright.
[14:41.28]Oh, I hope Karen will be alright.
[14:44.30]A toy?
[14:46.92]Let's go.
[14:54.94]Excellent.
[14:59.93]They added cars now.
[15:00.97]What?
[15:05.21]Okay.
[15:07.93]I guess I can fall off.
[15:14.22]Gotta make it!
[15:17.40]What?
[15:17.62]Come on!
[15:17.96]Jump!
[15:21.61]Onto the car!
[15:21.99]Onto the car!
[15:27.49]You can do it!
[15:28.07]Oh!
[15:28.29]Almost!
[15:35.44]97 seconds!
[15:45.23]Got there!
[15:46.71]Turn it!
[15:54.87]One more turn!
[15:55.51]Come on!
[15:58.74]Go!
[16:02.42]Almost there!
[16:05.03]Ride it!
[16:07.48]Ooh, great job!
[16:12.10]No!
[16:18.00]How close am I?
[16:24.68]Made it!
[16:32.77]Let's see how I did.
[16:37.34]A bee!
[16:38.06]Nice.
[16:40.46]Perfect.
[16:44.43]Yes.
[16:47.95]Ow.
[16:49.65]You have no idea how hard it was to keep that face the whole time.
[16:56.84]Oh, my face hurts.
[16:58.28]I was doing that the entire fucking time.
[17:04.92]I was doing like a cry face.
[17:16.29]This is all I care about right now.
[17:19.79]The only thing I fucking care about is this.
[17:21.21]No, it's not gonna work.
[17:57.40]When does it take the picture?
[17:59.00]I don't know.
[18:03.96]Is there more in this game?
[18:05.08]Or are we next-ing to something else?
[18:17.52]Almost.
[18:17.90]Oh, hold on.
[18:26.80]This is taking... This is what I'm trying.
[18:29.28]It's a lot of concentration.
[18:32.18]To do what I'm trying to do.
[18:45.33]Speed!
[18:46.13]God damn it.
[18:54.92]Come on, do the speed.
[19:03.25]This is not going to come out well.
[19:06.32]I'm trying.
[19:07.14]I will tell you guys.
[19:08.62]I am trying.
[19:09.38]Oh, come on.
[19:23.65]Alright.
[19:25.67]Watch out.
[19:26.33]Watch out.
[19:30.83]This is very... I can't... It's hard to tell.
[19:35.93]We're almost there.
[19:36.47]Alright, where's the end?
[19:45.08]We're there, right?
[19:49.20]Speed!
[19:49.54]Speed it up!
[19:50.38]I got like 20 seconds!
[19:53.58]Ow!
[20:01.95]There it is.
[20:05.86]Okay, let's see if I got it.
[20:08.46]Did I get it?
[20:11.37]I hope I got it.
[20:12.15]Mm-hmm.
[20:19.27]I got a D. It's still passing.
[20:24.37]Shit!
[20:25.89]God damn it!
[20:37.16]Wait, what do you mean triangle?
[20:38.14]Hold on, it takes more- I thought like that was just- hold on a minute.
[20:53.33]Alright, I'll get it this time.
[20:55.35]Okay, I'll get it.
[20:56.21]This is gonna take a little bit of concentration guys, hold on.
[21:16.83]I don't even know if this is gonna work.
[21:23.01]Let's see.
[21:26.96]I can't move.
[21:35.41]I think I'm doing alright.
[21:47.12]I have no idea what's going on.
[21:53.62]I think I'm doing a- no!
[21:54.94]We got hit there!
[21:57.46]I'm just jumping.
[22:03.06]Trying to avoid it.
[22:03.90]I gotta be getting close, right?
[22:16.32]This is all I care about.
[22:17.34]Hopefully I do it.
[22:17.96]I'm not doing too bad.
[22:32.23]Shit!
[22:33.25]Wait, no!
[22:37.43]God damn it!
[22:38.19]Okay, I gotta fucking win.
[22:42.17]Oh, wow, that sucks.
[22:47.52]I'm gonna have to do it again.
[22:54.47]Every time I need to jump, I- Well, that's because I'm- It's kinda difficult.
[22:59.67]I'll get it.
[23:00.17]Here we go.
[23:01.22]If I go slow- Fuck!
[23:21.14]I can kind of see.
[23:31.31]The payoff will be worth it.
[23:40.25]We're okay so far.
[23:46.58]Come on!
[23:51.33]Alright, we're good?
[24:00.63]I tried!
[24:02.62]Come on!
[24:06.74]No!
[24:07.78]No!
[24:15.72]We're okay.
[24:20.00]I'm guessing at this point, guys.
[24:25.99]I'm just gonna stay down.
[24:32.05]For the most part, at least.
[24:33.63]Shit.
[24:33.95]Please don't end the game.
[24:35.49]Don't end the game, please.
[24:38.37]Thank god.
[24:38.77]Okay, I gotta pay attention now.
[24:42.37]I can't fall down again.
[24:50.05]I'm actually watching the game now.
[24:57.75]Come on.
[24:59.43]Just get to the fucking end.
[25:06.76]Watch out.
[25:09.64]Almost there.
[25:10.08]Alright, hopefully I got like the first half.
[25:15.98]Oh, what?
[25:16.74]That wasn't a secret?
[25:25.24]Get out of the fucking way.
[25:28.88]Right here.
[25:33.45]Okay, did it work?
[25:36.45]That was way, that was way too much effort for how, like, not funny this is gonna be.
[25:42.47]Let's find out.
[25:43.07]Okay, was it worth it?
[26:16.86]Wasn't really worth it.
[26:23.91]Just not even looking at the game, just fucking staring.
[26:26.19]Oh, let's do the easy one.
[26:33.16]I wonder if I can get this.
[26:39.24]New passport photo.
[26:40.29]Alright, I gotta have to walk away for this.
[26:47.91]Hopefully I can get this.
[26:50.35]I have no idea.
[26:51.61]Let's hope it'll work.
[26:52.27]I just have to...
[27:03.26]This'll be fine.
[27:07.44]Make sure it's coming in the right fucking direction.
[27:12.86]It might not be.
[27:13.36]Give me a minute.
[27:33.27]I'm going the wrong way?
[27:34.17]What?
[27:36.09]Alright, this is it.
[27:42.62]We'll keep playing the regular game.
[27:52.94]I can at least try to play.
[27:57.76]Being all the way over here actually helps.
[28:09.29]Hope it's in the right spot Almost there
[28:35.76]What the fuck?
[28:36.38]Come on!
[28:45.69]How long is this one?
[28:53.78]Just get over there!
[29:13.02]Okay, we're good.

[29:16.50]It might not even be in the right spot.
[29:21.74]Okay.
[29:27.59]It's like a guy in a window.
[29:29.15]It's a fucking scary picture.
[29:36.15]Oh my god!
[29:40.33]Okay, are these pictures from the gameplay or is this me spying on somebody on surveillance?
[29:47.18]Are you fucking serious?
[29:51.04]These look like crime photos taken from a scene of a murder.
[30:02.67]This is the best one.
[30:04.07]That's the best one.
[30:08.27]Come on, Georgie!
[30:12.41]Alright, this one was taken at the very beginning.
[30:14.67]This was taken as I was standing up to go over to the door.

[30:36.20]I was gonna say- Never mind.
[30:43.23]Alright, what's the next level?
[30:44.59]Imagine, like, putting that down.
[30:50.70]No.
[30:51.64]I'm not even gonna say it.
[30:53.12]I'm not even gonna say it.
[30:54.00]Oh, that'd be so funny.
[31:06.21]Play the other character?
