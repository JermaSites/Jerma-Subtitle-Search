[00:16.59]Hey, what is up, Method?
[00:17.95]It's me, Jerma, again with a gameplay commentary.
[00:20.33]This is not going to be on Team Fortress 2, though.
[00:23.47]This is going to be on Super Meat Boy.
[00:25.97]Wanted to try and do something a little bit different.
[00:28.53]Super Meat Boy is an indie game.
[00:30.17]It's kind of off the beaten path.
[00:31.49]It's a little bit crazy.
[00:32.93]And there's a whole lot of FPS on this channel.
[00:35.29]So I figured, why not throw a little livecom, try and beat this game as fast as I possibly can.
[00:41.03]Probably not the whole game, now that I actually think about it.
[00:44.38]We'll see where I get, though.
[00:45.86]So let's just get right into this here.
[00:47.06]This is Chapter 1.
[00:48.44]Let's get started.
[00:50.64]So I'm gonna try and beat this, like I said.
[00:52.12]I'm gonna try and beat this entire chapter in the remainder of this video.
[00:57.10]So let's see if I can do it.
[00:57.94]I'm pretty good at this game.
[00:59.63]This is all live commentary, by the way.
[01:01.39]None of this is post.
[01:02.83]It's me just freaking out in live commentary.
[01:05.85]Let's try and get A-pluses on every single level, too.
[01:08.87]That's gonna be pretty difficult, though.
[01:11.65]Oh, come on, come on, come on.
[01:14.52]A+, there we go.
[01:16.38]This game is incredibly difficult, too.
[01:18.50]If you've never played this game, I highly recommend you at least give it a try.
[01:22.12]Because it is... Oh, should I get the warp zone?
[01:25.62]No, not yet.
[01:26.88]We're trying to beat the whole level very, very, very, very, very fast.
[01:30.26]Go, go, go!
[01:31.30]Oh my god.
[01:33.17]A+.
[01:35.75]Let's try this.
[01:36.57]I know that some of these levels can get very, very difficult.
[01:38.83]So if I think I can beat this entire game... Or at least... Oh, that wasn't an A+.
[01:43.21]Damn it.
[01:44.27]If I think I can beat this entire game... Oh, why didn't... That didn't register.
[01:47.17]That was stupid.
[01:48.48]There we go.
[01:50.00]Oh, by the way, I'm playing on a controller.
[01:52.06]There is no way in hell you can play this game unless you have a controller.
[01:58.79]At least speaking PC-wise, because this is on the PC.
[02:02.01]I actually don't even own a console.
[02:04.03]I do not own any console.
[02:06.19]So if you're wondering, well, Jerma, why the hell don't you just play this on Xbox?
[02:09.83]I don't own an Xbox, and I don't own a PS3.
[02:12.80]KB Mod.
[02:13.64]Keyboard, mouse, or die?
[02:16.34]That's a pretty cool podcast!
[02:18.70]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[02:19.84]A+.
[02:20.16]Yep.
[02:22.06]Let's go, let's go.
[02:22.80]I'm not going to waste any time here.
[02:24.36]I'm not going to waste any time.
[02:26.12]Let's try and do the long jump.
[02:27.60]Yep.
[02:29.72]Get it, get it, get it.
[02:30.48]Oh, that wasn't an A+.
[02:31.06]What the hell?
[02:33.05]Okay, let's just go.
[02:35.11]Tommy's cabin.
[02:36.75]Where Tommy got murdered.
[02:39.14]Get that Band-Aid.
[02:40.46]I should be getting the Band-Aids.
[02:41.72]Mmm, that was pretty bad.
[02:44.37]I should be getting the Band-Aids, but I'm not going to.
[02:47.25]Because I've seen at least me and my friend, my friend Burgah Boy.
[02:52.95]He's a friend of mine.
[02:54.29]We used to play this game all the time.
[02:56.82]And we would just specifically go after the Band-Aids.
[02:59.88]And oh my goodness, does that make you want to have your head explode.
[03:03.66]There's some Band-Aids in this game.
[03:05.14]If you collect the Band-Aids, I'll tell you what they do.
[03:06.50]The Band-Aids allow you to unlock new characters.
[03:08.90]So the more Band-Aids you get, I think it's like 10, 15, 20, and then like 40, 50, 60 Band-Aids, you can unlock different characters, and they have different moves, different abilities.
[03:18.44]Super Meat Boy is like the fastest, but he's not the best.
[03:21.78]I think the best one is Commander Video, and I forget where you even unlock him.
[03:26.21]I should probably ask Burgah Boy.
[03:27.87]He would know.
[03:29.60]Alright, getting closer.
[03:30.40]Trying to get to the end of this entire chapter before the video is over.
[03:35.96]I'm going to try and do it a couple times.
[03:37.32]Try and do it in each chapter.
[03:40.55]Come on now.
[03:41.29]Oh god.
[03:42.55]This is where it gets a little bit difficult.
[03:45.01]Go!
[03:45.85]Shit.
[03:47.45]I might start dying.
[03:49.29]Oh!
[03:49.51]Why did that not happen?
[03:51.41]This is where I'll definitely start dying.
[03:53.15]Okay, gotta slow down a little bit here.
[03:56.01]Wait, wait, there we go.
[03:57.23]There we go.
[03:58.49]Oh!
[04:01.43]Here we go, A+.
[04:03.71]Wow, no A+.
[04:06.47]The intermission.
[04:07.15]Okay, let's go.
[04:08.67]Watch out.
[04:11.77]Whee!
[04:13.65]Here I come to save the day!
[04:16.20]Oh my goodness.
[04:18.88]Okay.
[04:19.88]This is going to get a little longer.
[04:20.98]A+, that's sick.
[04:25.68]I just jumped right into that.
[04:26.80]I wasn't even paying attention.
[04:28.84]This has got to wait.
[04:29.78]Here we go.
[04:31.95]Here we are.
[04:32.65]Got to get rid of this middle thing.
[04:35.05]And then... My brain!
[04:40.42]Oh, probably should have waited.
[04:41.26]It's okay.
[04:42.40]I'm good.
[04:42.96]Good to go.
[04:46.32]Here we are.
[04:47.02]Oh, what the hell?
[04:48.52]I didn't... That was a bunch of BS.
[04:54.08]Because I didn't want to jump.
[04:55.24]I just hit the button.
[04:57.87]Oh, God.
[04:58.37]This is where it falls apart.
[04:59.53]This is where we fall apart.
[05:03.73]Here we are.
[05:04.25]Come on.
[05:06.33]Break.
[05:06.77]Done!
[05:07.27]There we go.
[05:08.34]That was lucky.
[05:09.88]That was very damn lucky.
[05:13.12]I'm no way I'm gonna beat this in time.
[05:15.44]To get an A+.
[05:16.02]Ugh!
[05:19.64]Oh my god!
[05:20.90]Alright, no more screwing around.
[05:23.26]Time to actually do this.
[05:27.66]No more screwing around.
[05:29.04]Let's go.
[05:31.58]Got that.
[05:33.20]Got that.
[05:35.26]That.
[05:36.08]Come on.
[05:39.08]No!
[05:39.74]No!
[05:42.70]Ugh!
[05:43.32]Here comes the rage fountain.
[05:45.65]Turning on the rage.
[05:48.33]Damn it!
[05:49.55]Alright, you know what?
[05:50.35]I'm not gonna go for the A-plus anymore.
[05:51.85]I'm just gonna go for the damn completion of the level.
[05:55.87]Ugh!
[05:57.67]Jerma's pissed.
[05:58.99]No, not really.
[06:01.82]Take your time.
[06:03.58]My biggest problem with this game is I never take my time for anything.
[06:07.78]I just go.
[06:08.32]I just go as fast and as hard as I possibly can, and it's a terrible idea.
[06:12.49]Alright, getting closer, getting closer.
[06:17.19]We're at the boss.
[06:18.65]Boss time.
[06:19.83]Lil' Slugger.
[06:21.55]So the bosses in this game, you don't really fight a boss.
[06:23.79]You kind of just have to run really fast away from a boss or make a boss kill itself.
[06:30.67]There's no attack in this game.
[06:31.79]I don't have like an X to attack.
[06:34.19]So it looks like he's lighting on the forest on fire.
[06:37.36]You bastard.
[06:39.46]And now he's in a big machine.
[06:41.54]What do I do?
[06:43.52]We have to run.
[06:45.94]Oh my goodness.
[06:46.76]Oh man.
[06:48.20]Here we are.
[06:48.66]Jump through this one, this one.
[06:50.49]This one's a big jump.
[06:53.25]Jump through the whole thing.
[06:54.01]There we are.
[06:54.59]Yeah.
[06:55.55]Figured that part out.
[06:56.45]Figured that part out.
[06:58.47]Get through this.
[06:59.99]Jump over this thing.
[07:01.23]Watch out for these assholes.
[07:05.57]Here he comes.
[07:06.83]Come on.
[07:07.27]Get me in.
[07:08.11]No.
[07:12.87]Super Meat Boy, you bastard.
[07:16.09]See, if you play this game and you try to get perfect on everything, you can see where you could potentially have an aneurysm playing this game.
[07:27.29]Oh, my God.
[07:28.09]There it is.
[07:28.45]I did it.
[07:29.02]Come on.
[07:29.70]Oh, my God.
[07:30.68]No.
[07:31.24]No.
[07:32.54]Okay.
[07:34.50]Thank God.
[07:36.16]I thought I was just going to die right there at the end.
[07:40.10]So that's going to be the end of the video, guys.
[07:41.98]This is the Chapter 1 cinematic, I guess.
[07:45.50]So thank you so much for watching.
[07:46.62]I really appreciate it.
[07:47.52]If you want to see Chapter 2 or Chapter 3, so on and so forth, in another video, then give me a comment or shoot me a thumbs up or something like that, and we'll go from there.
[07:56.57]So thank you so much for watching, guys.
[07:57.73]I'll see you next time.
[07:59.31]Take care, everybody.
