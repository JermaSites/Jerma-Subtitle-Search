[01:12.48]Oh, this guy pulled out his half-satoichi.
[01:14.82]Or I'll just miss, like, three times.
[01:16.81]That could happen, too.
[01:22.49]Oh, I'm so tired.
[01:24.13]Alright, so I'm fighting this soldier, and he accidentally pulled out his half-satoichi on me.
[01:28.26]And I'm a spy, so I just revolvered him.
[01:30.04]That was pretty funny.
[01:32.04]That's the best thing.

[02:09.72]Oh, I thought... That guy's lagging so bad that I really, really thought I reflected that, but apparently not.
[02:18.42]Alright, see, bad story.
[02:20.09]I feel like I'm trying so hard right now, I'm not even talking.
[02:22.63]I'm just so silent.
[02:25.71]Hey, I'm... That's usually what happens to me when I'm... Wait, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
[02:30.05]That's the opposite of what happens to me when I... What am I even trying to say?
[02:35.36]I don't know.
[02:35.74]I haven't figured out what I'm actually trying to say here.
[02:37.28]I'm trying to say when I play live, I can't play video games.
[02:43.04]I think that's probably what I meant to say.
[02:44.20]It is.
[02:44.66]Well, I'm spawn killing them at base with a spy.
[02:47.30]I backstabbed three people the second they walked out.
[02:50.50]Let's go for number four.
[02:51.94]Yep.
[02:52.94]Oh my god.
[02:55.48]You bad person.
[02:58.34]What?
[02:58.64]Whoa.

[03:04.24]Okay, this is bad.
[03:04.94]I'm back.
[03:05.20]This is... People... I'm, like, recording this.
[03:09.16]I shouldn't be.
[03:09.76]This isn't gonna work.
[03:12.54]Let's wait till next round.
[03:13.80]We can start it again.
[03:15.26]No, I can't.
[03:16.26]Oh my god, Spy, what are you doing?
[03:21.11]I feel like I was playing, like, a horror game right there.
[03:23.09]He just jumped up right in my face.
[03:27.41]I think... I think we won.
[03:36.07]Ends in 13 seconds.
[03:37.55]That heavy.
[03:39.47]Maybe he's going to come right up.
[03:41.56]Oh!
[03:42.44]Yikes.
[03:43.28]That was a crit right... Pretty much should be in the shin.
[03:47.47]Going around.
[03:49.79]Forget that guy.
[03:53.31]Oh, jeez.
[03:53.73]Look at all these dead bodies.
[03:55.29]I tried stair-stabbing.
[03:56.41]Look at this breadcrumb trail of dead people.
[04:00.03]Right outside blue spawn.
[04:01.45]He was calling for medic, too.
[04:03.39]Why?
[04:04.60]Why was he calling for medic?
[04:07.58]Nice job, Dean.
[04:10.12]Hey, thanks.
[04:10.96]Backstabbing them as they walk out of base.
[04:15.32]Oh, no way.
[04:17.18]Oh, my gosh.
[04:18.20]That guy's lagging.
[04:19.50]Jeez.
[04:21.34]I hear a roar across the whole stadium right now.
[04:23.38]What's happening?
[04:25.72]I don't hear anything.
[04:28.18]I hear... It sounds like I'm in a haunted mansion right now.
[04:31.64]Wait, what?
[04:32.44]Oh my god, it's a speed hacker!
[04:35.36]What?

[06:11.92]Hold on a second.
[06:14.34]I need to go spectate.
[06:16.20]I need to watch this guy.
